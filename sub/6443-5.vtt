00:12.188 --> 00:14.379
I'm not waiting around for some damn kid.

00:14.935 --> 00:16.052
He's late.

00:17.275 --> 00:18.438
Your watch is fast.

00:19.017 --> 00:21.811
Hey, say... If there's something I am
is never late

00:21.812 --> 00:24.362
I say I'm gonna be somewhere...
I'll be there like a flash.

00:25.463 --> 00:27.439
Nice car, man!
What is this, real leather?

00:27.440 --> 00:31.653
I got places to be small fry!
What do you got for me?

00:33.020 --> 00:35.793
I got some great stuff for you Mr. Hannison

00:36.115 --> 00:37.462
I'm talking top of the line.

00:50.492 --> 00:52.128
You've been busy.

00:52.795 --> 00:55.708
Well you know:
"Idle hands, empty pockets".

00:56.265 --> 00:59.834
- So what do you think?
- I give you $200 for the lot.

00:59.835 --> 01:01.672
It's worth it 10
times that much!

01:01.815 --> 01:05.049
Yeah, I told you I don't handle
this nickle dime crap anymore.

01:05.050 --> 01:09.750
You land a real score you come talk to me...
until then, you take what I give you.

01:11.668 --> 01:14.014
Maybe I should just take it all.

01:16.816 --> 01:18.944
That isn't a threat, is it kid?

01:39.350 --> 01:40.454
Ah, geez!

01:41.018 --> 01:42.674
Doctor said your doing great.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.360
Yeah right before he gave
me this new prescription.

01:47.759 --> 01:52.278
The red ones at least they'll go nicely with
my pink, blue and green ones I'm already taking

01:52.348 --> 01:55.280
I rather have more colors in the
medicine cabinet than not have you around

01:55.281 --> 01:58.522
I just didn't wanna have to worry your mother
anymore with this stuff, that's all.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.932
Dad, we both worry about you.

02:02.199 --> 02:03.999
What Jor-El did to
you because of me...

02:04.005 --> 02:06.158
Wow! Wait a minute, I knew
what the risk was, Clark...

02:06.216 --> 02:09.993
And I'll take it again in a heartbeat
if it meant keeping you safe.

02:10.929 --> 02:12.576
Didn't you and I have a game to catch?

02:13.618 --> 02:17.300
Metropolis Sharks, 50 yard line...
Lex really came through this time.

02:18.301 --> 02:20.806
Look son, I understand what that
friendship means to you,

02:20.810 --> 02:24.520
but please don't forget he had
you investigated, be careful.

02:24.530 --> 02:26.256
Not going into this with my eyes closed.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.406
He wants another chance
to prove he's changed

02:29.443 --> 02:30.417
Clark...

02:30.418 --> 02:32.385
Dad this is my senior year,
I don't want to have

02:32.400 --> 02:34.857
to worry about Lex or
Jor-El, or any of that.

02:35.180 --> 02:38.350
I just wanna live a normal life,
hang out with my friends and play football.

02:38.530 --> 02:42.202
Alright... why don't you go get the truck
We don't wanna miss the kick off.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.722
Dad!
Dad you're ok?

03:20.160 --> 03:21.450
Yeah, I think so...

03:23.451 --> 03:25.305
Your mother would be
visiting me in the hospital

03:25.331 --> 03:26.969
again if you hadn't
pushed me outta the way.

03:26.970 --> 03:30.412
Dad it wasn't me. I saw
someone who can move like I can

03:30.759 --> 03:33.583
I couldn't believe it, he saved you.

03:39.423 --> 03:43.719
Whoever it is, not only did he save my life,
Clark, he also stole my wallet.

04:41.706 --> 04:44.206
Original Airdate Oct. 20, 2004

04:58.904 --> 05:01.260
Hey! Aren't you two supposed to be at the game?

05:01.796 --> 05:04.752
Well the tickets to the game were in my wallet.

05:04.753 --> 05:07.989
Which was stolen, some kid swiped it
outside the medical building.

05:07.990 --> 05:10.795
Oh my god, your were robbed!
Are you alright? Did he have a gun?

05:10.796 --> 05:13.545
No, he had a very fast pair of sneakers but...

05:14.079 --> 05:16.399
I'm gonna call the credit card company
to report it stolen.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.176
Hey dad, wait!

05:18.300 --> 05:22.053
THis kid... he was as fast as I am,
I should find out who he is.

05:22.127 --> 05:23.835
Just let me talk to
Chloe, maybe she can

05:23.861 --> 05:25.652
track down where he's
been using your card.

05:27.315 --> 05:30.476
Come on dad, if I don't find anything by
the end of the day, then make the call.

05:31.872 --> 05:35.408
Alright, but I want you to be careful Clark,
we don't know anything about this kid.

05:35.551 --> 05:37.071
That's why I've to find out who he is.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.009
Are you sure you're ok?

05:42.535 --> 05:46.040
Sweetheart I'm fine... I wish you
wouldn't worry about me all the time.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.034
You were in a comma for 3 months Jonathan,

05:48.035 --> 05:50.438
it's hard not to worry when you've been
through so much.

05:50.453 --> 05:53.808
With a little help from modern medicine I'm
planning to go through a whole lot more.

05:53.823 --> 05:56.738
Starting with a romantic evening
with my beautiful wife.

05:57.622 --> 06:01.797
Maybe we could have a little' dinner and then...
drive on down to the lake?

06:01.798 --> 06:03.414
I'd love that sweetheart, but I...

06:04.521 --> 06:06.707
I'm gonna have to work late again tonite...

06:06.903 --> 06:11.020
Running the Talon is a lot more involved than
I thought it would be but... eh...

06:11.578 --> 06:12.734
I'll call you later, ok?

06:26.123 --> 06:27.405
<<The Greek Republic>>

06:58.531 --> 06:59.214
What is that?

07:02.558 --> 07:03.489
It's nothing.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.280
Looks like a very large tattoo hovering over
a very provocative spot.

07:08.281 --> 07:10.835
- When did you get that?
- Hum... uh... I got it.. uh...

07:11.906 --> 07:13.228
Before I came back from Paris.

07:14.776 --> 07:19.023
Really? Why didn't you tell me?
I could've come with you and gotten a mermaid...

07:19.024 --> 07:21.711
or an anchor... or a mermaid holding an anchor

07:22.508 --> 07:24.868
I didn't plan on getting it alright?
It kinda just happened.

07:25.088 --> 07:26.449
Tattoos don't just kinda happen...

07:27.812 --> 07:30.537
There's usually some ink and
a fair amount of pain involved.

07:31.631 --> 07:35.330
What was I supposed to do?
Ask you for permission to get it?

07:35.594 --> 07:36.366
Wow! Hey!

07:37.707 --> 07:39.867
That's not what I meant...
Why are you biting me head right off now?

07:39.868 --> 07:41.071
- I'm not.
- Yes you are.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.789
Look I just... I don't want you making
a big deal outta this

07:48.324 --> 07:50.943
I don't care about the tattoo, ok?

07:51.924 --> 07:54.374
But what bothers me is the fact that

07:54.400 --> 07:56.661
for some reason you felt like you
had to hide it from me

07:59.970 --> 08:02.518
I've seen what keeping secrets
has done to my parents...

08:03.041 --> 08:04.371
I'm not gonna end up like that

08:08.484 --> 08:11.517
Jason the last thing I ever wanna do
is hurt you.

08:13.373 --> 08:17.858
But there are some things that I am... just
I'm not comfortable sharing with you yet

08:20.435 --> 08:21.648
I'm sorry

08:31.940 --> 08:34.590
<< FRAGILE >>

10:02.504 --> 10:03.679
Dude!

10:04.976 --> 10:05.844
You lost?

10:06.735 --> 10:10.740
You know, cause I guess you must
be because... this is my room.

10:11.546 --> 10:14.960
Technically it's my dad's since you used
his credit cards to pay for it

10:15.684 --> 10:17.323
I didn't take anything from anybody.

10:17.901 --> 10:20.280
You can save the innocent act,
I had a friend trace all the

10:20.306 --> 10:22.863
charges you trying to stick on
him after you stole his wallet.

10:23.735 --> 10:27.411
And you went through my backpack!
Man, that's invasion of privacy...

10:27.412 --> 10:30.526
- messing with my stuff.
- Your stuff? You stole all this!

10:32.700 --> 10:33.935
Yeah?

10:35.925 --> 10:36.650
Prove it

10:42.256 --> 10:44.674
I saw you save my dad from
that truck this morning.

10:46.487 --> 10:48.604
Man, nobody sees me
when I'm doing my thing.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.791
Maybe you're not the only one
who can move like that...

10:51.908 --> 10:57.335
Jake Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West...
whatever your name really is...

10:57.732 --> 10:58.309
It's Bart.

10:59.486 --> 11:00.916
Not that it matters
cause I'll be

11:00.942 --> 11:03.215
a 1000 miles away before
you can even blink.

11:03.748 --> 11:05.966
I don't know...
I can blink pretty fast

11:08.247 --> 11:09.457
I'm warning you man

11:10.685 --> 11:12.250
I'm gonna get my dad's wallet, and then

11:12.255 --> 11:14.315
you and I are going to sit
down for a long talk.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.410
Not big of a chit chat, dude.

11:22.084 --> 11:23.405
Smell you later.

11:57.302 --> 12:01.521
Dad, I found the kid who stole your wallet
but I lost him out at the docks.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.083
He just took off across the water.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.120
Uhmm, son...

12:08.362 --> 12:09.106
Hi Clark.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.486
What took you so long?

12:23.125 --> 12:25.845
Dude, I didn't think anybody else
could move like that except me,

12:25.846 --> 12:28.754
because, hey... fastest man alive, right?
Yeah!

12:28.838 --> 12:30.639
You were right up my butt, man... and.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.297
You know I've always wondered if there's anyone
else out there like me and it turns out...

12:33.298 --> 12:36.215
to be you! Jimmy Crack-corn,
fresh from the farm.

12:36.216 --> 12:39.586
What Kind of story did you spin to con my
dad out of a free meal and a bed on the couch.

12:39.587 --> 12:41.551
No story Clark, just the truth.

12:41.986 --> 12:42.937
And what's that?

12:43.534 --> 12:44.884
Well.. A couple of years ago...

12:44.885 --> 12:46.865
there was like this accident... right

12:46.963 --> 12:48.308
a huge flashlight...

12:49.114 --> 12:51.489
and my body went into overdrive.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.542
And this happened in Smallville?

12:54.117 --> 12:54.881
No.

12:55.515 --> 12:56.942
It's my first time here... and.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.138
No offense dude... but.

13:00.114 --> 13:01.318
Hopefully the last

13:03.238 --> 13:06.562
I've never met anyone with powers like yours
that wasn't from around here.

13:06.563 --> 13:09.549
Yeah, well...
Maybe you should get out more.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.395
So, how did you get so fast?

13:14.722 --> 13:16.159
You had an accident too or...

13:16.888 --> 13:20.600
I was kinda born this way...
Why are you living on the streets Bart?

13:23.244 --> 13:24.664
What happened to your parents?

13:25.551 --> 13:28.627
Their son got zapped into a human
lightning bolt that's what happened

13:28.955 --> 13:32.604
I mean, they made this whole big deal that
everything was gonna be ok and that...

13:36.306 --> 13:39.067
I don't know man, you should've just seen
the way they looked at me...

13:39.879 --> 13:42.789
I could tell that...
nothing was gonna be the same...

13:43.607 --> 13:44.671
So you ran away?

13:46.673 --> 13:47.303
I'm...

13:48.513 --> 13:49.640
I just didn't fit in.

13:51.054 --> 13:54.980
- Man, I guess you don't have that problem...
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

13:56.623 --> 13:59.302
- I ran away once too.
- Yeah, why did you come back, man?

13:59.303 --> 14:01.814
Mow the lawn, milk the cows?

14:02.554 --> 14:04.253
Dude, you should be out there
with me tearing it up.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.632
You mean stealing everything in sight?

14:08.227 --> 14:10.050
It's not like I really hurt anybody...

14:11.039 --> 14:15.108
I mean I usually just swipe a little bling from
stiff upper crust whenever I need some cash.

14:16.141 --> 14:19.903
How much would you call "a have-not" Clark?
I take from "the haves".

14:19.904 --> 14:21.131
Like my dad?

14:21.843 --> 14:26.849
Look man, don't even sweat it ok?
They don't charge you if your card's stolen.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.314
Oh, and that makes it alright?

14:28.839 --> 14:32.975
Look man, my friends down at suicide slums...
they sure changed me...

14:32.976 --> 14:35.003
So I had to boost your dad's
card in order to get a

14:35.015 --> 14:37.455
get a room I don't like spending
the night out in the streets.

14:37.494 --> 14:39.103
Ok? Stuff happens there...

14:39.463 --> 14:42.154
When I'm asleep I'm just
as slow as everybody else.

14:45.590 --> 14:48.298
Don't hit me with the big
cow eyes there stretch? Ok?

14:48.299 --> 14:51.891
- I could always take care of myself...
- Yeah you've done a great job so far.

14:54.540 --> 14:57.435
You know what man? Enough of
the poor little' street urchin right?

14:57.962 --> 15:01.866
Let's take a closer look at
the mysterious Clark Kent

15:05.199 --> 15:06.227
let's see...

15:06.862 --> 15:09.794
you like to read about
native American mythology..

15:10.829 --> 15:16.286
You've scrolled the name "Lana"
on your notebooks.

15:16.287 --> 15:18.923
And you've one of the most
boring hobbies known to man...

15:20.635 --> 15:22.749
- Rock collecting.
- I don't collect rocks...

15:29.985 --> 15:31.045
Dude you're ok?

15:31.046 --> 15:32.483
Put that away

15:33.387 --> 15:34.146
I'm allergic.

15:36.591 --> 15:39.231
Man! I've heard of people
sneeze around cats and dogs

15:39.700 --> 15:42.180
and stuff but never get all weak
in the knees over a rock.

15:42.187 --> 15:43.491
It's a long story.

15:44.561 --> 15:48.042
It's one I'm sure I'd love to hear
after we get back...

15:49.522 --> 15:50.323
Get back from where?

15:50.916 --> 15:51.961
Anywhere we want

15:52.662 --> 15:55.337
I mean do we have
2 super power studs here?

15:55.668 --> 15:57.842
Why else do you think I came all over
to Smellyville looking for you man?

15:57.843 --> 15:59.897
Let's go crank it up!
Go have some fun.

16:00.535 --> 16:01.980
Did you ever seen Florida?

16:09.943 --> 16:11.894
<i><< GRAND RE-OPENING >></i>

16:14.397 --> 16:17.965
Dude, man, that girl in the black bikini she was
totally checking you out.

16:18.240 --> 16:18.934
No she wasn't.

16:18.935 --> 16:21.683
Look the girl was eyeing you
like you were a snow-cone dude...

16:21.684 --> 16:22.842
you should've
gotten her number.

16:22.868 --> 16:25.388
I can't just walk up to a girl on
the beach and get her phone number.

16:25.395 --> 16:26.895
Yeah, well, lucky for you...

16:28.070 --> 16:28.987
I can.

16:29.815 --> 16:31.903
She said to call her next time
you are in Miami.

16:32.897 --> 16:35.535
- I can't just go running back down to Miami.
- Why not?

16:35.974 --> 16:37.928
- Because it's...
- It's what?

16:37.929 --> 16:39.324
Too much fun Clark?

16:39.545 --> 16:41.615
Come on, nobody's ever died from it.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.242
What are you doing?

16:46.381 --> 16:48.553
I'm eating a cookie, dude
I'm starving.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.952
You can't just take whatever you want
My mom runs this place.

16:50.953 --> 16:55.418
Look man, there's a line...
I don't do lines.

16:55.419 --> 16:59.381
What's up Kent? I thought you'd still be in
Metropolis playing detective

16:59.472 --> 17:01.432
I thought I leave that one up to the authorities.

17:01.551 --> 17:03.071
They never would've caught him anyway.

17:03.883 --> 17:07.329
- Chloe this is my friend Bart, he's from..
- The future.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.152
- Really?
- Yeah

17:09.749 --> 17:11.809
I ran all the way back
in time to tell you that

17:11.835 --> 17:13.680
we are still in love a
100 years from now.

17:14.851 --> 17:15.932
Bart...

17:16.290 --> 17:18.047
What's your favorite kind of flower Chloe?

17:18.267 --> 17:19.413
Uhmmm... tulips.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.159
- How did you do that?
- Magic.

17:29.329 --> 17:30.662
You wanna see some more?

17:31.872 --> 17:32.691
Clark!

17:35.983 --> 17:36.928
Knock it off!

17:39.921 --> 17:42.813
Your dad called...
Is that the boy who robbed him?

17:43.171 --> 17:46.078
- Yeah, his name's Bart Allen.
- Why's he here?

17:46.280 --> 17:48.717
I think he's lonely,
wants to be my friend.

17:48.743 --> 17:51.058
Good, maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.037
I'm trying.

17:52.511 --> 17:54.376
Oh, uh... Lex is looking for you sweetheart...

17:54.377 --> 17:57.216
he asked if you'd stop by the mansion,
he said it's important.

17:57.263 --> 17:59.023
Ok, but I probably
shouldn't leave Bart alone

18:04.181 --> 18:06.101
I really don't think he'll notice you're gone...

18:13.877 --> 18:17.202
I purchased this from a private collector
in St Petersburg...

18:18.015 --> 18:20.618
convincing him to part with
it required a few glasses

18:20.644 --> 18:23.149
of vodka and a small fortune
but it was worth it...

18:23.395 --> 18:24.299
That's very nice.

18:25.251 --> 18:27.426
Take a closer look at the border design.

18:29.546 --> 18:34.407
Embedded glyphs, similar to the Kowaichi
symbols found in the cave.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.426
No one's spent more time down there than you.

18:42.518 --> 18:43.987
Any idea what they mean?

18:45.406 --> 18:46.397
No.

18:47.703 --> 18:50.023
But I thought you weren't interested
in this stuff anymore.

18:50.501 --> 18:52.947
Oh, I'm still interested Clark,
just not obsessed,

18:53.571 --> 18:55.660
Which is why I'm not keeping this from you

18:56.982 --> 18:59.434
I'd like it if we could work on
this mystery together

18:59.846 --> 19:00.999
I'd like that.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.173
So what is it?

19:05.826 --> 19:09.916
It's the last surviving page from
a XIV century manuscript.

19:11.175 --> 19:14.228
It depicts the Grand Prince
Donskov's victory over

19:14.254 --> 19:17.247
his mortal enemy Mamaia
at the battle of Kulikova.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.076
Legend has it that...

19:20.288 --> 19:23.666
this was the only object
adorning the walls of Rasputin's

19:23.692 --> 19:26.836
chamber while he studied at
the Verkhoturye Monastery.

19:28.747 --> 19:33.733
He believed this page will reveal
a path to unimaginable power

19:34.493 --> 19:39.815
Rasputin would stare to it for days at a time
in the attempt to penetrate its secrets.

19:41.119 --> 19:43.241
- It's incredible...
- Don't

19:44.994 --> 19:48.586
I had state of the art security installed
to protect it

19:49.898 --> 19:51.984
I'm keeping it at the
mansion for a few days

19:52.010 --> 19:54.048
before it goes into the
vault at Luthorcorp.

20:01.046 --> 20:03.171
Sorry Clark I have an appointment...

20:03.874 --> 20:07.585
Why don't you swing by tomorrow and...
we'll roll up our sleeves...

20:09.920 --> 20:10.664
Yeah.

20:23.546 --> 20:26.836
- Dude, you know Lex Luthor?
- What are you doing here?

20:27.555 --> 20:30.390
Well, Chloe shut me down,
but you know, her loss...

20:30.768 --> 20:31.895
Man this place is awesome!

20:32.067 --> 20:34.887
- Man have you seen all the cool stuff?
- You were just in there?

20:35.347 --> 20:36.587
Yeah, I just took a quick spin.

20:38.086 --> 20:40.267
Don't worry man, he
won't even have a clue.

20:40.293 --> 20:41.601
You gotta get outta here

20:41.964 --> 20:44.629
Clark, who're you talking to?

20:59.123 --> 21:00.015
Dad!

21:00.229 --> 21:01.233
Hey Clark!

21:01.845 --> 21:04.493
Just in time son, your
mom's working late again

21:04.501 --> 21:06.452
so I thought maybe
we'd have guys night.

21:06.453 --> 21:08.773
You know, catch up on the highlights
of the game we missed?

21:08.775 --> 21:11.545
I saw something in Lex's
dad, it was a page of an

21:11.571 --> 21:14.285
old manuscript that had
Krytonian symbols on it.

21:14.325 --> 21:15.754
Kryptonian symbols?

21:16.623 --> 21:17.831
Were you able to read 'em?

21:17.832 --> 21:20.926
It had a message, repeated over and over:
"Look deeper"

21:20.927 --> 21:23.765
I used my X-ray vision and I saw
a map hidden underneath.

21:24.618 --> 21:25.233
A map?

21:29.132 --> 21:30.039
A Map to what?

21:31.677 --> 21:34.252
I don't know dad, but I think
it has something to do with Jor-El,

21:34.259 --> 21:36.379
and what he sent me after
when he was controlling me.

21:36.385 --> 21:39.292
- I want you to leave this alone,
Clark... - No, dad... - Son!

21:41.634 --> 21:43.971
You were just telling me how you'd like
to have a normal senior year, right?

21:43.972 --> 21:47.346
Well, how does traipsing across the globe
on Jor-El's crusade fit in with that?

21:47.347 --> 21:50.884
It doesn't, but hanging out with Bart
reminded me that I'm not normal, dad.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.413
Maybe it's time I stopped running
from who I really am.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.158
What you really are is a 17 year old boy.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.665
Sit down.

22:02.391 --> 22:04.259
Dad, it doesn't matter how old I am.

22:04.827 --> 22:06.426
Whatever Jor-El sent
to me find I've a

22:06.452 --> 22:08.147
feeling it's very
powerful and dangerous,

22:08.148 --> 22:10.274
especially if it falls into
the wrong hands, and I'm

22:10.300 --> 22:12.199
the only one who could
stop that from happening.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.939
How?
By stealing this manuscript from Lex?

22:15.240 --> 22:17.265
No, he's no idea of what he has...

22:17.270 --> 22:19.345
All I have to do is to sneak back
in there and get a better look at it.

22:19.347 --> 22:21.669
Clark, it's a bad
idea, he could see you.

22:21.725 --> 22:24.362
I'll be in and out before
he even knows I'm there.

22:28.631 --> 22:29.547
Dude!

22:29.920 --> 22:34.065
Lex's place was sweet!
I mean that guy's got like 20 cars!

22:34.066 --> 22:37.246
Man, there's no way you get that rich
playing it straight.

22:38.402 --> 22:42.257
Man, I gotta step it up a notch
because that's definitively how I wanna live.

22:42.258 --> 22:44.858
Listen, Bart, there's something I've got
to take care of, alright?

22:45.162 --> 22:46.065
Can I come?

22:46.091 --> 22:49.679
No, it's personal, but maybe
we'll hang out when I get back.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.200
Oh dude, there's this
midnight showing.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.727
"Speed" at the Mann's
Chinese theatre...

22:52.729 --> 22:56.599
best popcorn and Keanu rules in that one...
So do you wanna go?

22:56.602 --> 23:00.450
You know it sounds great, but...
just don't mention it to my dad, ok?

23:00.476 --> 23:01.562
Ok.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.287
Clark!

23:07.649 --> 23:11.836
Man, it's been really cool hanging out
with somebody like me, you know?

23:12.890 --> 23:16.076
So I gotya something,
just to say thanks for everything.

23:21.599 --> 23:24.148
It's an mp3 player. That
way you can download all

23:24.174 --> 23:26.875
your favorite tunes and
listen to 'em wherever we go.

23:28.558 --> 23:29.905
Where did you get this?

23:31.892 --> 23:33.230
I got it for you Clark.

23:33.839 --> 23:36.452
- It doesn't matter where I got it.
- Yes it does Bart.

23:39.268 --> 23:40.933
You haven't been listening
to anything I've said to you.

23:40.934 --> 23:42.598
You can't go around
stealing whatever you want.

23:42.599 --> 23:45.038
- Why not?
- Because there are laws

23:45.537 --> 23:46.872
for normal people!

23:47.884 --> 23:51.998
And dude, why do you treat your abilities like
they're a curse? They're not man!

23:52.003 --> 23:53.062
They're a gift!

23:54.381 --> 23:56.778
- I'm gonna use 'em.
- I'm not saying you shouldn't.

23:56.793 --> 23:58.893
Just use 'em to help people not hurt them.

23:58.894 --> 24:01.225
- Whom am I hurting?
- The store I swiped this from?

24:01.226 --> 24:04.029
- Cause they're insured.
- That doesn't make it right.

24:05.204 --> 24:08.663
Whatever dude, I'm not sticking around
for another lecture.

24:09.439 --> 24:11.160
What are you gonna do?
Run away again?

24:11.507 --> 24:13.873
You're not gonna solve all your problems
like that, Bart.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.565
Look, I'm not running away, Clark

24:17.896 --> 24:20.483
I'm running towards something.
I'm gonna have everything

24:20.509 --> 24:23.408
I've ever dreamed
of one way or another.

24:23.409 --> 24:23.974
Bart...

24:23.985 --> 24:27.464
Look, I thought you and I
were the same but I was wrong.

24:27.809 --> 24:30.629
You are nothing like me

25:04.993 --> 25:06.060
Bart!

25:07.033 --> 25:08.133
Don't Move!

25:09.236 --> 25:10.131
Clark?

25:16.702 --> 25:18.732
What the hell are doing here?

25:28.547 --> 25:30.948
Would you like to explain what happened here?

25:32.256 --> 25:33.328
Just came by to say hello.

25:33.551 --> 25:37.109
Next thing I know all this alarms and lights
are going off.

25:38.433 --> 25:39.725
It's a little' late for a...

25:40.578 --> 25:42.626
- Social call Clark...
- Yeah, I just...

25:42.941 --> 25:45.191
I should've called but
I just figured you'd be up.

25:48.661 --> 25:51.208
Are you sure you didn't see anyone else
when you came in?

25:52.526 --> 25:54.008
No, I didn't see anyone.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.802
Then you don't know who did this?

26:02.260 --> 26:03.041
No, I don't

26:06.330 --> 26:07.411
I believe you

26:08.765 --> 26:10.919
I know a real friend would never lie to me

26:20.816 --> 26:22.762
I better go and let you take care of this

26:23.980 --> 26:28.507
I'll let you in on a secret...
I'm not that worried...

26:32.288 --> 26:34.949
You said this manuscript page
was worth a fortune.

26:35.993 --> 26:36.889
It is.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.081
And there aren't
that many fences in

26:40.094 --> 26:42.472
Metropolis that can move
such a high-end item.

26:46.228 --> 26:48.903
If I put a reward at him,
sure some fiscally

26:48.929 --> 26:51.226
challenged citizen will point me
in the right direction.

26:52.651 --> 26:53.822
Do you think that'll work?

26:57.048 --> 26:58.241
Don't worry Clark.

26:59.844 --> 27:01.799
Our thief is gonna learn
that there's nowhere

27:01.806 --> 27:03.984
on Earth he can run
from Lex Luthor.

27:11.817 --> 27:14.218
I'd like that too, Jonathan, but I can't.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.301
Because I still have all this work to do

27:19.105 --> 27:21.815
I'll be home as soon as I can
that's the best I can do

27:21.841 --> 27:22.885
ok, bye.

27:24.874 --> 27:26.062
You're working late?

27:26.852 --> 27:30.352
Oh god, it's like this never stops,

27:30.365 --> 27:33.815
I don't know how you managed all this and
went to school too, Lana.

27:33.826 --> 27:39.537
It wasn't easy... but I don't remember
staying this late after closing every night.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.906
Well it's easier to do this here than at home.

27:44.988 --> 27:46.855
Is everything alright Mrs. Kent?

27:47.975 --> 27:53.081
Oh, Jonathan thinks the only reason I took
this job is to help out our finances

27:58.473 --> 28:02.017
I love him... so much...

28:02.018 --> 28:05.144
But after everything that's happened,
all his health problems...

28:05.145 --> 28:08.329
The only time I'm not worrying about
losing him is when I'm here...

28:08.330 --> 28:09.221
working.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.356
But if you're here all the time then...

28:15.303 --> 28:16.932
you don't see him anyway.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.337
Isn't that like you lost him already?

28:26.654 --> 28:30.547
That summer in Paris's really
given you some insight, Lana.

28:35.071 --> 28:37.034
Thank you for reminding me.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.323
Reminding you of what?

28:40.190 --> 28:42.550
That it's easier to
deal with your fears

28:42.565 --> 28:44.668
if you can share them
with someone you love.

28:54.453 --> 29:00.281
Sure, however you wanna handle it
No problem, it is my pleasure.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.769
Well it's about time.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.380
Well I had some things to
take care of, maybe when

29:08.406 --> 29:10.915
you grow up you'll understand
how men do business.

29:14.826 --> 29:16.198
Is this grown up enough for you?

29:20.994 --> 29:21.938
It's a start.

29:41.387 --> 29:44.129
Mr. Luthor I believe that I've something
that belongs to you.

29:54.809 --> 29:57.287
Is this the dangerous criminal
you warned me about?

29:57.288 --> 30:01.474
Hey, it's not your problem
Come on, let's talk about that finder's fee.

30:01.475 --> 30:04.354
He's just a kid Let him go.

30:04.850 --> 30:05.746
No.

30:06.287 --> 30:08.703
You've no idea what that freak is capable of.

30:08.714 --> 30:11.957
If I were you I'd be more concerned
about the police right now, Hannison.

30:16.666 --> 30:17.986
What did you do?

30:19.788 --> 30:23.408
In about 5 minutes this place will be
swarming with Metropolis P.D.

30:25.378 --> 30:29.128
Well ok, then I guess
we better hurry this up, uh?

30:29.365 --> 30:30.260
Tony!

30:48.775 --> 30:50.518
Look at the mess you made kid!

30:53.714 --> 30:57.506
Let's see if you're faster than
the speed of a bullet!

31:08.914 --> 31:10.627
You don't wanna be here!

31:16.394 --> 31:18.458
You still think what you do
never hurts anyone?

31:24.463 --> 31:25.188
Lex!

31:27.052 --> 31:27.850
Lex?

31:28.561 --> 31:29.919
I am sorry Clark.

31:35.704 --> 31:37.185
This doesn't change anything.

31:39.761 --> 31:42.085
You don't understand...
it'll kill me.

31:45.242 --> 31:47.028
You're not a murderer!
That's not who you are!

31:47.029 --> 31:49.466
- You don't know who I am!
- Yes I do.

31:50.298 --> 31:52.540
Why did I say you saved my dad?

31:53.190 --> 31:54.490
I've seen the good in you

31:55.623 --> 31:58.556
Bart, you gotta stop running
or in the end you'll just

31:58.582 --> 32:01.354
be alone and you don't want that.
I know you don't.

32:01.633 --> 32:02.934
I know because down deep...

32:03.980 --> 32:04.915
we're the same

32:14.655 --> 32:16.101
I wish that was true Clark.

32:43.686 --> 32:47.965
- You've no idea of where Bart could be?
- Lex was unconscious...

32:48.273 --> 32:51.458
I stayed with him until I heard the
police sirens then I went after Bart.

32:52.175 --> 32:54.218
By then he could've been
halfway around the world

32:55.352 --> 32:56.953
I think it could be for the best, Clark.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.335
Dad!

32:58.345 --> 33:00.755
Now look, I know how much you
wanted to help him about but...

33:00.957 --> 33:03.645
you can't force people to change
no matter how strong you are.

33:03.720 --> 33:07.000
He's not a bad kid, dad, he's just different,
at least he's willing to accept that.

33:07.005 --> 33:09.040
Clark, embracing your
abilities and flaunting them,

33:09.045 --> 33:10.687
are 2 entirely different things.

33:11.085 --> 33:11.885
I know.

33:13.185 --> 33:15.335
It's just sometimes
there's a part of me

33:15.345 --> 33:17.017
that wishes I could
be more like him.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.462
I mean... I've spent so much
time trying to hide who I

33:19.488 --> 33:21.412
really am, I'm starting to
feel like 2 separate people.

33:21.418 --> 33:23.675
Clark, I think you'd be
really surprised to find out

33:23.685 --> 33:26.234
how many normal people
feel exactly the same way.

33:26.541 --> 33:28.605
Yes, son, everybody has secrets,
yours is just...

33:29.243 --> 33:30.671
it's just bigger than most.

33:32.348 --> 33:35.343
- I better go check on Lex.
- Alright, you wanna use the truck?

33:35.548 --> 33:39.125
No, I uh...
Kinda wanna stretch my legs.

33:49.275 --> 33:50.683
Hey!

33:51.675 --> 33:53.088
Thought you'd be
at work all day.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.400
Well that's one of the
benefits of being the boss.

33:55.486 --> 33:58.872
I promoted Linda to assistant
manager so I can take a break

33:58.898 --> 34:01.888
and spend some time with a
ruggedly handsome farmer.

34:02.777 --> 34:04.897
Well, you're in luck,
there just happens to be one...

34:05.404 --> 34:07.281
sweating in your driveway right now.

34:07.366 --> 34:10.061
Maybe I should get the hose
and a bucket of soap.

34:17.112 --> 34:20.339
- I really missed you.
- Me too.

34:42.215 --> 34:43.350
This is amazing.

34:43.976 --> 34:45.826
When Clark first found this caves...

34:46.119 --> 34:48.603
I had no idea why was he
so obsessed with them

34:48.800 --> 34:51.327
I always felt like he was
keeping this secrets from me

34:51.453 --> 34:54.076
because he was afraid of
how I was going to react.

34:55.306 --> 34:59.049
I don't wanna live like that
I don't wanna be afraid all the time.

34:59.050 --> 35:02.050
You don't have to be, not with me,
that's what I've been trying to tell you.

35:04.139 --> 35:05.274
Ok.

35:08.153 --> 35:10.456
Remember the church we went to in Paris?

35:11.579 --> 35:13.916
Yeah, I had to live early to make
arrangements for your birthday...

35:13.920 --> 35:15.440
Well after you left
I noticed something

35:15.464 --> 35:17.427
strange on the tomb
of Countess Thoreau.

35:17.521 --> 35:21.682
There were these symbols edged into the rock,
like the ones in this cave.

35:21.907 --> 35:22.947
How is that possible?

35:24.693 --> 35:25.773
I don't know.

35:27.331 --> 35:31.933
And when I touched them, there was this
blinding light and then pain...

35:32.079 --> 35:36.549
and all I remember is waking up the next
morning to you knocking on my door.

35:42.247 --> 35:43.803
And I had this.

35:51.769 --> 35:53.047
Ok wait a second...

35:53.448 --> 35:54.762
So you're saying...

35:56.200 --> 36:00.029
that some strange symbols on the tomb
of a dead countess...

36:00.030 --> 36:01.220
gave you a tattoo?

36:01.943 --> 36:03.161
You know how odd it sounds...

36:04.596 --> 36:06.444
Why do you think I didn't wanna tell you?

36:08.227 --> 36:09.728
That's why you left Paris

36:11.186 --> 36:12.862
I had to come back to these caves

36:13.677 --> 36:16.915
I had to find out why I was missing
12 hours of my life.

36:21.088 --> 36:22.900
But all I found were more questions.

36:31.469 --> 36:32.641
It's the same as yours.

36:33.472 --> 36:34.792
What does the symbol mean?

36:36.120 --> 36:37.084
I don't know.

36:39.886 --> 36:43.617
- Jason I don't know what's happening to me.
- Ok, Ok.

36:45.242 --> 36:46.521
Whatever it is...

36:47.649 --> 36:49.432
we'll figure it out together ok?

36:50.962 --> 36:51.932
Ok

37:06.879 --> 37:07.567
Clark!

37:08.958 --> 37:10.935
It's good to see you keeping normal hours.

37:11.685 --> 37:13.309
Just came by to see if you're alright

37:13.838 --> 37:15.758
I heard you ran into some trouble
in Metropolis..

37:16.235 --> 37:19.468
- News travels fast.
- The curse of a small town.

37:21.522 --> 37:22.767
So, what happened?

37:23.053 --> 37:26.478
I decided to play cowboy
and got my spurs handed to me.

37:27.259 --> 37:29.421
To be honest I don't know why I'm not dead.

37:32.009 --> 37:33.649
There must be somebody watching over you.

37:34.112 --> 37:35.640
In more ways than one.

37:41.031 --> 37:42.348
How did you get this back?

37:43.625 --> 37:44.627
I didn't.

37:45.155 --> 37:48.049
It was sitting on my desk when
I returned from the Hospital.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.432
Whoever took it must've had
a change of heart

37:51.267 --> 37:52.255
I guess he did.

37:54.252 --> 37:56.449
Look, we'll have plenty of time
to study this later...

37:57.168 --> 37:59.433
Right now, I'm still
nursing a bit of a headache.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.581
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

38:16.790 --> 38:18.019
Clark

38:19.547 --> 38:22.002
I thought you'd like to know
I had the manuscript page

38:22.010 --> 38:24.940
examined by a team of experts
as soon as it turned out.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.582
Do you know what they discovered?

38:31.772 --> 38:33.657
That I payed too much for it.

38:38.168 --> 38:39.662
Thanks for checking in on me.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.347
Dude, your drawing sucks

39:08.224 --> 39:09.738
I'm sick of the hero thing.

39:10.126 --> 39:12.654
You mean like returning a
priceless artifact to its owner?

39:13.798 --> 39:15.567
Kinda all that money would've just
slowed me down anyway.

39:15.568 --> 39:17.418
To a dead stop if I hadn't found you.

39:17.671 --> 39:18.881
Yeah, how did you do that?

39:19.009 --> 39:21.719
What are you? Fast? Strong? And psychic?

39:22.203 --> 39:23.336
I wish

39:24.665 --> 39:27.249
I spent a whole night down
at suicide slums trying to

39:27.275 --> 39:29.858
convince someone that I had
a 1000 of these to fence.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.174
A few guys pointed me in
the direction of Hannison.

39:33.597 --> 39:36.382
Look at you,
channeling your inner criminal.

39:39.414 --> 39:40.642
So, uh...

39:41.274 --> 39:42.443
What are you gonna do now?

39:42.839 --> 39:45.605
I don't know.
It's a big world.

39:45.692 --> 39:47.045
We gotta to check it out.

39:50.311 --> 39:52.112
See if there's anyone else out there like us.

39:52.228 --> 39:54.276
Maybe start like a club
or league or something.

39:58.616 --> 39:59.977
You know you could come with me...

40:01.089 --> 40:02.192
or you could stay...

40:03.621 --> 40:04.993
You've a great life, Clark, but...

40:06.316 --> 40:09.845
It's not mine
I've no reason to stay in Smallville.

40:11.036 --> 40:12.080
You've me.

40:16.596 --> 40:18.810
Thanks for being my friend.

40:20.729 --> 40:23.026
Are you sure there's nothing
I can do to change your mind?

40:27.139 --> 40:28.312
Tell you what...

40:29.406 --> 40:32.044
If...
you can catch me,

40:34.345 --> 40:35.459
I'll think about it.
