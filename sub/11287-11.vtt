Synclaire, there are
more important things

what're you babbling about?

Oh, nothing much.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.266
This is Dean Cain's wallet.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.200
I found it in the cab
on the way home.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.400
‐ Dean Cain's wallet?
‐ Khadijah.

in the study

01:54.506 --> 01:55.706
like the rest of this junk.

01:57.506 --> 01:59.173
I am here to meet your mother

01:59.240 --> 02:00.673
and confirm my theory

02:00.740 --> 02:03.113
that you were raised
by wildebeests.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.746
Hey, we didn't miss it,
did we?

02:07.813 --> 02:10.880
Oh, get the hell out. Come on.

02:10.946 --> 02:13.046
Why is everybody
so hot to meet my mother?

02:13.113 --> 02:15.913
Because we all wanted to see
what Rosemary looked like..

02:18.313 --> 02:20.513
...twenty‐seven years
after having a baby.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.446
Oh!

02:22.513 --> 02:23.846
I think it's so sweet she's come

02:23.913 --> 02:26.146
to visit her little Maxie Waxie.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.146
Oh, please, she's only in town

02:28.213 --> 02:31.146
to receive a Woman's Legal Fund
Lifetime Achievement Award.

02:31.213 --> 02:32.713
Is the rest of your family
comin' too?

02:32.780 --> 02:33.980
I haven't seen 'em in a while.

02:34.046 --> 02:36.446
Nah, my brother
is getting a NAACP Award

02:36.513 --> 02:38.246
and my dad's receiving
an honorary degree

02:38.313 --> 02:41.846
from UPenn, so,
it's just mom and me.

02:41.913 --> 02:44.746
The underachieving chore.

02:44.813 --> 02:47.380
Uh, Maxine,
during your cleaning frenzy

02:47.446 --> 02:49.380
did you remember
to hide the..

02:50.846 --> 02:53.313
No, Kyle,
your mango flavored body gel

02:53.380 --> 02:54.980
is still on the nightstand.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.980
No, you couldn't have been
raised by wildebeest

02:59.046 --> 03:01.720
they have more class.

03:01.786 --> 03:04.753
Yeah, personally, I was leani'
towards mountain people

03:04.820 --> 03:06.953
who practice snake handling
as a religion.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.653
Don't worry, mango man,
my mom isn't staying here.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.986
She only drops by
for a few minutes

03:13.053 --> 03:15.153
and then she goes and checks
into a four‐star hotel.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.186
Oh, can't stand to be near
each other, huh? Tell me more.

03:19.253 --> 03:20.953
You know,
I hate to disappoint you

03:21.020 --> 03:22.453
you little crypt keeper..

03:23.786 --> 03:24.786
...but my mother and I

03:24.853 --> 03:25.953
enjoy a very

03:26.020 --> 03:28.253
very civilized relationship.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.020
We limit our conversations
to points of law.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.320
She cross‐examines me,
she finds me guilty

03:32.386 --> 03:33.353
we move on.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.553
My mom and I
talk about everything

03:36.686 --> 03:39.353
except Aunt Helen's
ambrosia recipe.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.920
You know, we get to arguing
about the mini marshmallow

03:41.986 --> 03:43.720
versus the big puffy one
that somebody always

03:43.786 --> 03:45.353
runs off in tears.

03:48.753 --> 03:50.386
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
come on, come on, come on

03:50.453 --> 03:52.186
careful with that.

03:52.253 --> 03:54.453
What, you use your
diploma as a dustpan

03:54.520 --> 03:56.853
what's so special about these?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.120
Those are the briefs
for the summation

03:58.186 --> 03:59.520
I'm giving tomorrow.

03:59.586 --> 04:01.193
I'm up against
a senior prosecutor.

04:01.260 --> 04:02.326
This case means a lot to me.

04:02.393 --> 04:03.860
So, shove it
underneath the couch.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.193
Hey, man. She maybe a slob

04:07.260 --> 04:10.293
but girlie does have a system.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.293
[knock on the door]
Maxine's mommy's here.
Maxine's mommy's here.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.493
[indistinct chatter]

04:14.560 --> 04:16.426
Maxine's mommy's here. Come on.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.493
‐ Maxine.
‐ Mom.

04:29.693 --> 04:32.560
I suddenly feel like exhibit A.

04:32.626 --> 04:35.859
Um, they want to see,
if like daughter, like mother.

04:35.926 --> 04:38.026
Oh, 25 years of hard work

04:38.093 --> 04:40.726
a tad more attention
to haircare and yes

04:40.793 --> 04:42.693
Maxine will look like me.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.426
Oh, you,
you're a killer, yeah.

04:49.426 --> 04:50.693
Everybody..

04:50.760 --> 04:52.726
...this is my mother, Nina Shaw.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.260
‐ 'You remember Khadijah?'
‐ 'Of course.'

04:55.326 --> 04:58.026
From college editor
to independent publisher.

04:58.093 --> 05:00.533
That's right,
good to see you, Mrs. Shaw.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.700
And Synclaire.

05:01.766 --> 05:03.600
Assistant slash
aspiring actress.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.400
‐ And Regine.
‐ Uh, former buyer.

05:07.466 --> 05:09.333
Current customer.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.800
‐ And Overton.
‐ Ah!

05:10.866 --> 05:13.033
Handyman and three‐point
shot maker.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.500
Booyah. Hey, Ma.

05:17.366 --> 05:18.300
Oh?

05:26.466 --> 05:27.966
I'm Kyle.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.033
How do you do?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.066
[chuckles]
The stockbroker?

05:32.133 --> 05:34.233
Oh, good for you.

05:36.633 --> 05:40.066
Wait, you‐you haven't
heard of me, Kyle Barker?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.333
You certainly seem
very proud of yourself?

05:49.433 --> 05:50.966
So‐so, where‐where
are you staying?

05:51.033 --> 05:53.200
The Waldorf or the Pierre?

05:53.266 --> 05:56.633
I thought I'd stay someplace
a little different this time.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.366
Here, if that's okay?

05:59.433 --> 06:01.406
Oh. Oh, that's fine

06:01.473 --> 06:05.306
[mumbling]
Lovely, lovely's what it is.

06:05.373 --> 06:08.873
Is this some sort of bizarre
side effect of menopause?

06:09.973 --> 06:11.840
Oh, well,
will you look at the time?

06:11.906 --> 06:14.040
Hey.
It's a pleasure meeting you.

06:14.106 --> 06:15.873
We really have to run now.
Bye‐bye.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.306
Uh, you know, you will

06:18.373 --> 06:21.340
you will really
love your stay here.

06:21.406 --> 06:24.173
There's, uh, plenty
of mango body gel.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.006
And you really
don't know who I am?

06:31.073 --> 06:32.006
(Regine)
'Come on.'

06:40.306 --> 06:42.206
Right, right, right,
about this hotel

06:42.273 --> 06:43.906
if it's a question of money
there's some jewels I can hock‐‐

06:43.973 --> 06:47.006
Maxine, receiving this award

06:47.073 --> 06:50.640
has afforded me
the opportunity to take stock.

06:50.706 --> 06:52.673
And I realized
that I'm quite pleased

06:52.740 --> 06:55.240
about virtually
every area in my life

06:55.306 --> 06:57.973
except our relationship.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.546
And I've decided
it's time for us to get close.

07:00.613 --> 07:02.213
And if we could do it
by Saturday

07:02.280 --> 07:03.613
I'd greatly appreciate it.

07:05.613 --> 07:06.646
Joking.

07:08.346 --> 07:09.446
Laughing.

07:12.613 --> 07:14.380
"And you really
don't know who I am?"

07:14.446 --> 07:16.246
Ha, ha, ha!

07:19.013 --> 07:21.413
You know,
I just figured out why Max

07:21.480 --> 07:23.113
didn't tell her mother
about me, alright?

07:23.180 --> 07:24.746
She's obviously worried that

07:24.813 --> 07:26.746
if our relationship
doesn't work out

07:26.813 --> 07:28.146
she'll have to spend
the rest of her life

07:28.213 --> 07:30.313
listening to her mother ask
whatever happened to the guy

07:30.380 --> 07:32.680
who had it all.
You know, Kyle Barker?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.180
But why didn't tell
her mom about you

07:36.246 --> 07:38.346
before you started dating?

07:38.413 --> 07:40.180
Clearly, she was inebriated

07:40.246 --> 07:43.146
by the Barker magic
from the start.

07:49.046 --> 07:50.880
Even I didn't go for that one.

07:54.713 --> 07:56.113
‐ Uh, pardon me?
‐ 'Yes.'

07:56.180 --> 07:57.713
Does Khadijah James live here?

07:57.780 --> 08:00.086
Well, yes, she does. Right here.
Come on.

08:03.253 --> 08:05.020
Synclaire, who's that?

08:05.086 --> 08:06.053
[humming]
I don't know.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.553
But he wants Khadijah.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.886
Well, how do you know
he's not an axe murderer?

08:13.220 --> 08:14.620
Do you see an axe?

08:18.553 --> 08:20.386
Khadijah,
you spoke to my assistant

08:20.453 --> 08:22.086
I'm Andy Oysterman,
vice president

08:22.153 --> 08:24.853
of programing
for Warner Brothers television.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.453
Dean Cain asked me to thank you

08:26.520 --> 08:27.720
and tell you how anxious he is

08:27.786 --> 08:29.353
to get back his wallet
so he can get back

08:29.420 --> 08:32.053
to entertaining America.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.220
Hold up, I'm not really
in a habit of giving things

08:34.285 --> 08:36.020
to people that don't
belong to them.

08:36.086 --> 08:37.586
Oh, I'm not just anyone
I'm the guy

08:37.653 --> 08:38.986
who said who cares if he's 21.

08:39.053 --> 08:41.220
Keep that Urkel in suspenders.

08:41.285 --> 08:42.820
It's a good idea.

08:44.986 --> 08:46.486
If you did that there's no
tellin' what you're gonna do

08:46.553 --> 08:48.420
with that wallet.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.153
I'm not givin' it anyone
but Dean Cain.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.720
How about
if I offer you two passes

08:52.786 --> 08:55.686
to the Hollywood Wax Museum?

08:55.753 --> 08:56.753
Hm.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.153
Let me tell you

08:58.220 --> 09:00.226
that chamber of horrors,
much more exciting

09:00.293 --> 09:02.793
than watching Dean
pretend to fly.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.060
Wow.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.126
Sorry. No Dean, no wallet.

09:07.860 --> 09:10.160
Oh, come on!

09:10.226 --> 09:12.693
I can't go back to LA
without the wallet.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.360
♪ Well welcome to Brooklyn ♪

09:20.826 --> 09:22.893
You're a mean lady.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.226
I'll show you.
I'll show all of ya.

09:25.293 --> 09:27.493
I'll create another show
with Dudley Moore.

09:34.293 --> 09:35.560
[blows]

09:49.626 --> 09:51.493
Isn't this refreshing?

09:51.560 --> 09:53.560
We're not out
at a fancy restaurant

09:53.626 --> 09:56.026
not talking law?

09:56.093 --> 10:00.333
Yeah, you know,
I've never felt closer..

10:00.400 --> 10:03.233
It's like we're the Judds?

10:03.300 --> 10:06.466
Come on, can we please
check you into the Waldorf

10:06.533 --> 10:09.666
and grab a real meal Le Cirque.

10:09.733 --> 10:13.700
Maxine, I'm not giving up.
I want us to bond.

10:13.766 --> 10:15.533
Well, I watched you
ordered sesame noodles

10:15.600 --> 10:17.366
and correct
the delivery man's Chinese.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.100
What more do you want?

10:21.300 --> 10:23.533
Uh, let's try confiding
in each other.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.966
Uh, tell me something
you haven't told anyone.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.866

Let me think.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.000
My middle name is Felice.

10:39.066 --> 10:42.100
I know that,
I gave you that name.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.433
Well, it's something
I never tell people.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.400
I hate that name.

10:45.466 --> 10:47.000
Now, that I didn't know.

10:47.066 --> 10:48.866
[chuckling]
Oh.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.500
We're making progress.

10:53.066 --> 10:56.866
Now, okay, let me share
something with you.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.273
I think the New York
criminal code

11:02.340 --> 11:05.273
is far more pro‐defendant
than Pennsylvania's.

11:08.073 --> 11:11.006
Oh, really? Alright, alright.

11:11.073 --> 11:13.106
Got one for you.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.740
I think the uniform
commercial code

11:14.806 --> 11:16.273
is so bogged down
in minutiae

11:16.340 --> 11:18.506
it's completely ineffective.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.173
I had no idea you felt that way.

11:23.473 --> 11:25.706
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

11:25.773 --> 11:29.873
Alright. Okay, you go.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.506
Let's see..

11:33.173 --> 11:35.006
A few years after you were born

11:35.073 --> 11:36.373
I had a brief affair
with this man

11:36.440 --> 11:38.606
in my law school class.
Now, you go.

11:38.673 --> 11:40.606
[choking]

11:46.473 --> 11:47.673
Wow!

11:49.073 --> 11:50.606
You had an affair?

11:50.673 --> 11:52.773
Well, it was a long time ago.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.673
Your father was always
at the hospital.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.773
I was trying to raise
two small children

11:56.840 --> 11:58.940
make law review
and find rhyming slogans

11:59.006 --> 12:01.080
for Jesse Jackson.

12:01.146 --> 12:02.480
The pressure got to me

12:02.546 --> 12:04.080
and, so, for a few weeks

12:04.146 --> 12:06.280
I lean on somebody else.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.580
Please.
It's hard enough to imagine

12:08.646 --> 12:10.613
you leaning with dad.

12:12.013 --> 12:13.746
It was a mistake

12:13.813 --> 12:15.413
but the affair forced
your father and me

12:15.480 --> 12:17.513
to face our problems head on.

12:17.580 --> 12:20.146
Our marriage has been
the stronger for it.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.413
Good for you.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.680
Now, unless you're about
to tell me that my real father

12:24.746 --> 12:27.213
is the mailman

12:27.280 --> 12:29.346
why are we having
this conversation?

12:29.413 --> 12:31.980
I was hoping
it would draw us closer.

12:32.046 --> 12:34.746
Psychology Digest says that this
is the sort of personal thing

12:34.813 --> 12:36.846
a mother and daughter
ought to be able to share.

12:36.913 --> 12:38.113
Well, you might have
read somewhere that

12:38.180 --> 12:40.646
you can't improve your
relationship with your daughter

12:40.713 --> 12:43.246
by treating it like it's
something on your to‐do list.

12:43.313 --> 12:44.980
‐ Maxine Felice‐‐
‐ Nah, Felice, Felice.

12:45.046 --> 12:48.013
Nah, nah, nah.
I like the distance between us.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.046
So, getting close is gonna be
one of the few things

12:50.113 --> 12:51.880
that great Nina Shaw
does not accomplish.

12:51.946 --> 12:54.246
Now, if you will excuse me

12:54.313 --> 12:56.680
I have to prepare
a closing argument

12:56.746 --> 12:58.180
for very important case.

12:58.246 --> 13:00.053
Maxine, now, you listen to me

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
as long as you're
under my roof..

13:03.886 --> 13:04.920
Damn.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.153
‐ Morning, people.
‐ Oh, Maxine.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.886
Look, um, I understand why

13:12.953 --> 13:14.653
you didn't tell
your mother about me

13:14.720 --> 13:17.486
and I'm touched,
you insecure little moppet.

13:18.486 --> 13:20.320
Ta!

13:20.386 --> 13:22.353
Yeah, well, I gotta
get out of here myself

13:22.420 --> 13:23.953
promised the people up in 2A

13:24.020 --> 13:26.520
that I'd fix that
squeaky floorboard.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.520
Maybe I can come with you
and step on the boards

13:28.586 --> 13:31.153
make that little squeaking sound
like Jingle Bells.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.253
[squeaking]

13:36.120 --> 13:37.453
Where's Khadijah?

13:37.520 --> 13:39.353
She's doing a
"Where are they now?" piece

13:39.420 --> 13:42.220
on Vanilla Ice.

13:42.286 --> 13:43.820
But she's got to wait
till the end of a shift

13:43.886 --> 13:45.153
at Burger King.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.353
[sighs]

13:53.420 --> 13:54.720
Something wrong?

13:57.220 --> 14:00.660
[fake crying]
My mother wants us
to get close.

14:00.726 --> 14:04.026
Why?

14:04.093 --> 14:06.326
You know, it's like
they‐they give birth

14:06.393 --> 14:10.626
they look at the stretchmarks
and they just start trippin'.

14:10.693 --> 14:13.026
I mean, okay, so,
so, maybe my mom

14:13.093 --> 14:14.760
isn't the warmest

14:14.826 --> 14:17.293
most affectionate woman
in the world

14:17.360 --> 14:19.626
but she left me the hell alone

14:19.693 --> 14:21.726
to go my own way.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.426
That taught me independence

14:23.493 --> 14:24.893
self‐reliance

14:24.960 --> 14:26.826
initiative.

14:26.893 --> 14:28.360
Thanks to her I'm the woman

14:28.426 --> 14:29.593
the maverick

14:29.660 --> 14:31.593
you see before you.

14:33.293 --> 14:35.293
Really? Then I'm mad at her too.

14:36.693 --> 14:38.993
Ugh. I wish she'd take her award
and go home.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.893
I wish she'd go home.
I wish she'd go home.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.326
I wish she'd go home.

14:48.226 --> 14:50.260
Ah, well. Forget it.

14:50.326 --> 14:52.326
I've got a tough case
to worry about.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.926
Seems my client

14:54.993 --> 14:57.260
stumbled into a convenient store

14:57.326 --> 14:58.426
accidently drew a gun

14:58.493 --> 15:00.466
and mistakenly
held up 12 people.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.066
Hey, mom?

15:14.133 --> 15:18.233
No, I‐I was just
thinking about you.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.700
No, I'm not, I'm not engaged.

15:21.766 --> 15:24.366
No, I'm not seein' anybody, uh..

15:26.033 --> 15:28.333
Yeah, I'm a lesbian, that's it.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.233
Hold it.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.533
[knocking on the door]

15:34.600 --> 15:35.666
Uh!

15:38.300 --> 15:41.000
Hi, I'm looking
for Khadijah James.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.366
I'm Khadijah James but‐‐

15:42.433 --> 15:44.833
That's right, it's me,
Burt Ward, TV's Robin.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.633
Wow!

15:51.700 --> 15:53.600
Batman's partner
in crime‐fightin'.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.133
The Boy Wonder
in the house, hey.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.166
Well, listen. The fellows over
at Warner Brothers

15:58.233 --> 15:59.573
told me that you wanted to meet

15:59.640 --> 16:01.306
a television superhero.

16:01.373 --> 16:03.940
So, here I am.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.273
Uh, well, if you wouldn't mind,
uh, the wallet?

16:06.340 --> 16:11.206
Hey, could you do
a "holy cape crusader" for me?

16:11.273 --> 16:12.573
You can't just do one of those

16:12.640 --> 16:14.840
you have to be in the moment.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.273
Overton Wakefield Jones,
bat‐o‐phile.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.206
Uh, I remember, uh, one show

16:21.273 --> 16:24.973
when Catwoman, uh, turned you
into her love slave

16:25.040 --> 16:26.773
and made you fight Batman.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.573
I was traumatized..

16:28.640 --> 16:30.406
yet, uh, intrigued.

16:30.473 --> 16:32.506
Hm. Me too.

16:32.573 --> 16:33.940
Uh, now, about that wallet?

16:34.006 --> 16:37.206
Oh, about the wallet,
nobody gets it but Dean.

16:37.273 --> 16:39.540
Why, because Superman can fly?

16:39.606 --> 16:41.673
Because bullets bounce off him?

16:41.740 --> 16:44.940
Well, any pansy can change
clothes in a phone booth

16:45.006 --> 16:46.840
but it takes
a special kinda man

16:46.906 --> 16:49.440
who can change
while sliding down a pole.

16:51.173 --> 16:52.106
Listen, Burt, I‐‐

16:52.173 --> 16:54.240
Sorry, I wasn't born
on Krypton.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.006
I mean, I had to deal
with pesky little things

16:57.073 --> 17:00.546
like gravity
and that 30‐pound utility belt

17:00.613 --> 17:02.746
and don't get me
started on those elf shoes.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.780
Right, right, right,
look, I think

17:03.846 --> 17:05.146
it's about that time
that you go.

17:05.213 --> 17:06.713
Holy strawberries, Batman,
are we in a jam.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.246
Come on, man.

17:18.713 --> 17:20.713
Eh, you almost had them.

17:20.780 --> 17:24.113
Fred, the prosecution
had 14 eyewitnesses

17:24.180 --> 17:26.380
a videotape
and a signed confession

17:26.445 --> 17:27.813
from our client.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.780
The jury found him guilty
in less than five minutes.

17:29.846 --> 17:31.813
I know,
but your closing argument

17:31.880 --> 17:33.380
was so stirring

17:33.446 --> 17:36.346
I started thinking,
hey, maybe he didn't do it.

17:40.213 --> 17:43.213
I'm outraged by what just
took place in that courtroom.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.480
Mom, what are you doing here?

17:44.546 --> 17:45.913
It's inexcusable.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.146
I know, I know, I should've
better prepared but you know‐‐

17:48.213 --> 17:50.980
Oh, no, I wasn't talking
about your performance.

17:51.046 --> 17:52.946
That was one of the finest
closing arguments

17:53.013 --> 17:54.346
I've ever heard

17:54.413 --> 17:55.713
comparing the policeman

17:55.780 --> 17:57.680
who made the arrest
to Mussolini?

17:57.746 --> 18:00.253
Stroke of genius.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.153
Really, well, I..

18:02.220 --> 18:05.386
I can't believe the instructions
that judge gave the jury

18:05.453 --> 18:08.053
they had no choice
but to find your client guilty.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.153
Nobody does that to my baby
and gets away with it

18:10.220 --> 18:12.420
I'll have him
thrown off the bench.

18:12.486 --> 18:13.486
What did you just say?

18:13.553 --> 18:14.920
I'll have him
thrown off the bench.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.420
No, what was that

18:16.486 --> 18:19.453
nobody does that to my baby
thing you said?

18:21.353 --> 18:22.553
Well, well, well..

18:22.620 --> 18:26.253
I can't remember every word
I say verbatim.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.520
That's why God gave us
court reporters.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.586
Oh, well, you don't have to make
a big deal on my account.

18:34.653 --> 18:36.586
I'll start
on the appeal tomorrow.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.486
There must be
something I can do?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.086
Well, it, it might be nice

18:42.153 --> 18:43.553
if you could..

18:46.653 --> 18:47.953
It'd be really nice if I could..

18:49.720 --> 18:51.086
Oh!

18:55.086 --> 18:56.053
Ew!

18:58.720 --> 19:00.026
Well..

19:01.226 --> 19:03.393
What brought you
down here anyway?

19:03.460 --> 19:06.693
I missed
your high school graduation

19:06.760 --> 19:09.593
your volleyball
state championship game

19:09.660 --> 19:11.193
and your performance
in the "Nutcracker"

19:11.260 --> 19:12.860
as the Rat King.

19:14.293 --> 19:17.393
I wanted not to miss something.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.860
Yeah, believe me

19:19.926 --> 19:22.626
the "Nutcracker" was better.

19:22.693 --> 19:25.060
How 'bout a consolation dinner?

19:25.126 --> 19:27.293
Well, alright.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.026
Do you wanna try takeout
at my apartment again?

19:30.093 --> 19:32.126
Are you sure you wanna risk it?

19:32.193 --> 19:34.960
I might attempt
to open up again.

19:35.026 --> 19:37.360
Well, if you promise not to

19:37.426 --> 19:39.360
I'll do the Rat Thing, you know.

19:39.426 --> 19:41.160
My pirouette
around a piece of cheese

19:41.226 --> 19:42.493
is still quite impressive.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.893
‐ Ah!
‐ Ha!

19:44.960 --> 19:46.793
♪ Tak tak ♪

19:50.026 --> 19:51.493
Yes, yes, yes.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.060
[knocking on the door]

19:56.126 --> 19:57.593
It's uncanny.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.460
My horoscope says
you'll read something

19:59.526 --> 20:01.733
that'll predict
how your day will go.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.066
Hi, I'm Dean Cain.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.000
‐ Hey.
‐ How you doing?

20:14.066 --> 20:16.666
Hey. Wow.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.300
I'm Khadijah James,
I can't believe you came‐‐

20:19.366 --> 20:21.166
I can't believe he really came.

20:21.233 --> 20:23.933
Well, as soon as I heard you had
my wallet I flew right out.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.833
Flew? Like Superman flies.
I get it.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.666
You're good. You're good.

20:28.733 --> 20:30.666
No, really, I flew on a plane.

20:30.733 --> 20:33.433
‐ Oh.
‐ Well, here's your wallet.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.000
I'm sorry, I made you
come all the way out here

20:35.066 --> 20:36.233
but I'm telling you,
there's something funny

20:36.300 --> 20:38.166
about that Oysterman guy.

20:38.233 --> 20:41.133
And you would not believe
who they sent next.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.366
Burt Ward.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.500
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, they always send Burt.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.766
So, tell me the truth
you really won't work

20:50.833 --> 20:51.833
without that receipt?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.933
Well, I am a little bit
superstitious.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.800
You know, I'm so careful
with this thing that I

20:55.866 --> 20:57.700
that I haven't out
in almost three years

20:57.766 --> 20:59.506
and here it is

20:59.573 --> 21:02.240
"Turkey sausage, Hash browns"

21:02.306 --> 21:04.340
"Wheat toast"

21:04.406 --> 21:06.673
I didn't order wheat toast.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.840
They overcharged me.

21:08.906 --> 21:11.140
Well, I guess, it's not
so lucky after all, huh?

21:11.206 --> 21:12.806
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it very much.

21:15.306 --> 21:16.473
Bye‐bye.

21:19.906 --> 21:21.440
Oh, man.

21:21.506 --> 21:23.640
He forgot his lucky rabbit's
foot. I'm gonna go get him.

21:23.706 --> 21:25.106
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:25.173 --> 21:26.873
Let's wait
till he gets back to LA.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.673
I wanna see Burt Ward again.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.473

<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:36.383 --> 21:37.850
I'll tell you
who gets on my nerves.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.317
Spiderman.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.650
‐ Spiderman?
‐ Exactly.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.150
He can do whatever a spider can.

21:44.217 --> 21:46.217
Big deal, unless you're a fly.

21:46.283 --> 21:48.183
And what about the thing?

21:48.250 --> 21:49.517
Uh, to tell you the truth,
I haven't really

21:49.583 --> 21:50.917
thought that much about it.

21:50.983 --> 21:52.583
Who would,
he's just a pile of rocks

21:52.650 --> 21:54.183
with a chip on his shoulder.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.450
And Aquaman,
I had him over once.

21:56.517 --> 21:58.317
Ha, what a whiner.

21:58.383 --> 22:01.223
"I need more water.
I need more water."

22:03.123 --> 22:06.323
Burt, do you think,
playing that TV superhero

22:06.390 --> 22:10.057
sort of distorted
your perception of reality?

22:10.123 --> 22:13.157
I don't know. Maybe.

22:13.223 --> 22:16.157
So, uh, do you ever
use your X‐Ray vision

22:16.223 --> 22:17.723
to check out Wonder Woman?

22:20.390 --> 22:21.657
Waiter,
can I get the check, please?

22:24.123 --> 22:26.157
(female #1)
'Woo‐hoo!'

22:26.223 --> 22:28.157
