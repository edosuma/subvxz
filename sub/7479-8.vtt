WEBVTT

00:23.691 --> 00:26.421
- You got a pen?
- Yeah.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.471
You know,
if you really wanna say you care,

00:39.640 --> 00:43.440
you should ditch the card and buy him
a pint of bourbon for the big day.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.335
- Hey.
- Huh?

02:25.412 --> 02:27.471
All right, kitty cat, behind the back,

02:27.648 --> 02:30.310
standing on one leg,
double tap, center mass.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.663
Wow.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.730
Can I see your gun?

02:47.901 --> 02:48.993
My gun? What for?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.831
It's a Beretta 92FS, right?
L.A.P.D. Issue?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.063
Actually, yeah.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.504
NCIS agents carry SIGs.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.143
I just wanna see how yours fires.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.904
I'm sorry, you wanna fire my gun?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.377
- You're acting weird.
- I just don't like people firing my gun.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.752
- Okay, let me just hold it then.
- I don't like people holding my gun.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.115
- You can fire mine.
- I don't want to fire your gun.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.190
I don't want anything to do
with your gun, and it's not personal.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.657
- Feels personal.
- It's just a guy thing.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.727
- A guy thing?
- A gun thing.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.091
I said it's a gun thing.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.790
Funny. You said a guy thing.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.433
Oh, buddy.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.702
Hell hath no fury
like Kensi Marie Blye.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.405
The groin? Really?

03:32.579 --> 03:34.809
Why does one practice
shooting someone in the groin?

03:37.317 --> 03:39.114
Rough night?

03:39.686 --> 03:41.677
- I'm meditating.
- Mm-hm.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.784
Looks like you're sleeping.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.788
It's called meditation.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.392
Is it normal to snore
when you're meditating?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.593
- Stop staring at me.
- I'm not staring.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.064
I can feel it, G.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.136
I honestly just don't
understand what the big deal is.

03:58.338 --> 04:01.068
You don't trust me. I'd say
that's a big deal, wouldn't you?

04:01.275 --> 04:02.640
I have a thing about my gun.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.505
At this point in our relationship,
after all that we've done...

04:05.712 --> 04:07.304
- Zip... I'm sorry.
- What?

04:07.481 --> 04:11.941
- Did you just say relationship?
- No, I said partnership, okay?

04:12.152 --> 04:14.916
- You're very annoying.
- Maybe I just need a little bit of space.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.921
- You're on my desk.
- Shh.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.355
Listen, here. Both of you.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.858
You don't trust each other.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.497
All the fist-bumping and saying
you got each others' back

04:24.665 --> 04:26.599
doesn't mean squat
unless there's trust.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.134
So build it soon, or risk
the consequences. You got it?

04:30.337 --> 04:32.100
And for the record, I was meditating.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.210
Is that what meditation sounds like?
Because I call that yelling.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.677
New case on deck.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.680
Rise and shine.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.114
Meditation is over.

04:50.757 --> 04:54.022
Thomas Booth is an Army sergeant
turned Delta Force operator

04:54.194 --> 04:57.459
who, until recently, worked closely
with the Marines in Afghanistan.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.623
Joint task force ops.
Highly classified missions.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.567
Last night, his car was discovered
in a parking garage after closing time.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.706
Booth had placed a wireless video cam
on his dashboard.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.536
Knew the meeting
could've gone wrong.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.507
Booth put in for retirement
60 days ago.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.044
He was kidnapped on the exact day
he became a civilian.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.011
What was Booth working on?

05:16.183 --> 05:18.083
Well, most of Booth's file
was redacted.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.083
He was a member
of Task Force 232,

05:21.288 --> 05:24.815
a unit responsible for hunting down
high-value targets in Afghanistan.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.050
Terrorist leaders
with prices on their heads.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.489
Bounties of up to 25 million

05:28.662 --> 05:31.859
that go to informants who give key tips
to units like Booth's.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.524
Bring them in dead or alive.
Some of the deadliest guys around.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.330
So Booth had access to information
that was not only classified,

05:38.505 --> 05:39.995
but also worth millions of dollars.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.040
Hmm. Task Force 232
is based at Camp Pendleton,

05:43.210 --> 05:44.438
but I've been told the squad's

05:44.611 --> 05:47.239
at the team leader's house today
for a barbecue.

05:47.414 --> 05:51.441
A half an hour after he was kidnapped,
six cars left the garage.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.245
Now, the first five checked out,

05:53.420 --> 05:56.116
but the sixth
was reported stolen by L.A.P.D.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.620
Just the night before.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.452
Police just found it.
It's a silver Audi A4.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.322
Empty, but it's a start.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.521
You two check out the car.
Sam and I will handle Booth's unit.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.199
We're off to a barbecue.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.436
What would you do with
$25 million in reward money?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.372
You mean if I wasn't
a government employee

06:17.544 --> 06:19.739
and I could legally accept it?

06:21.949 --> 06:26.318
Ah, probably buy a first-class ticket
to somewhere real quiet.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.887
Really quiet.
Someplace you don't take a partner.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.857
You?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.558
I would hire the best private
investigator money can buy.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.459
I'd have him track down my partner,
and when I found him...

06:38.632 --> 06:40.429
You'd follow me?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.898
I'd send him Hetty,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.264
in an overnight package,
with a big bow.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.100
Heh. I wouldn't sign for her.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.400
NCIS, right?

06:49.576 --> 06:52.602
These are the men
of Task Force 232.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.172
Gotta go native.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.578
Clean-cut Marines stand out
behind the lines in Afghanistan.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.309
- You heard about Booth?
- He got snatched.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.250
You don't seem too upset about it.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.288
Maybe he had it coming.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.153
Not a very friendly bunch.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.327
Seems angry.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.498
Maybe he should take up
meditation.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.661
What was Booth's skill set?

07:15.902 --> 07:17.665
Why was he assigned to your unit?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.965
Languages.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.475
Booth is fluent in Pashto.
Not a lot of guys in the military are.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.443
When he retired early,
that left us in the lurch.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.673
Can't communicate with the locals,

07:29.850 --> 07:31.784
makes taking down
our targets harder.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.213
Why did he retire early?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.980
He wanted to be hired
by a private contractor as a translator.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.717
They pay a premium for guys
with his language skills.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.360
In a lot of ways,
we're closer with Booth

07:43.530 --> 07:44.963
than we are with our own families.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.123
But when he walked away
from our unit with targets

07:47.300 --> 07:50.030
still on the ground,
he walked away from us.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.502
For money.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.735
Affirmative 27.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.303
Officer, NCIS.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.982
What do we have here?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.845
We found some fingerprints
that didn't match up to our databases.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.182
Gentlemen, how you doing?
I need to talk to you guys for a second.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.085
You guys see anything
I should know about?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.852
Nope.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.896
Sure about that?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.862
Well, last night we saw some guys
around the corner

08:24.037 --> 08:25.436
in the empty lot with flashlights.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.732
- What did they look like?
- It was too dark to see,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.535
which means they didn't see us.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.506
How many were there?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.051
Five went out there
and four came back.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.111
That's all we saw.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.689
You can keep giving me money
if you want to, but that's all I know.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.952
Hey.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.856
Car's a dead end for now.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.587
Come on.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.083
Do you smell that?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.532
That's a hell of a retirement party.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.038
Did Booth have any enemies?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.743
Yeah, as a matter of fact, there was
someone who hated Booth pretty bad.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.477
His son Brandon.

09:53.592 --> 09:57.119
Marker lines all over his skin
correspond to non-lethal wound points.

09:57.295 --> 09:59.286
Lines are targets
for these stab wounds.

09:59.464 --> 10:02.228
I mean, just drawing them on
must have been psychological torture.

10:02.434 --> 10:05.767
You want to inflict the worst pain
possible without killing a guy?

10:05.937 --> 10:07.370
This would be the way.

10:07.572 --> 10:09.403
Gunshot to the head. Mercy kill.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.739
He was interrogated.
Booth had information.

10:12.911 --> 10:13.935
Once he gave it up,

10:14.112 --> 10:15.773
kidnappers capped him
and dumped the body.

10:15.947 --> 10:17.881
No excessive mutilation
indicating a grudge,

10:18.049 --> 10:21.177
like a gunshot wound to the groin,
for instance.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.881
Judging by the wounds,

10:25.056 --> 10:27.547
Booth must have been tortured
for hours before he was killed.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.727
He knew something.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.624
But what?

10:34.833 --> 10:37.131
Eric, we're outside Brandon
Booth's residence right now.

10:37.302 --> 10:38.496
What did you dig up on him?

10:38.703 --> 10:42.901
Eighteen years old, only child
of Thomas and Yasmin Booth.

10:43.074 --> 10:46.771
Parents divorced when he was 12.
Brandon lived with his mom.

10:46.945 --> 10:49.277
She died two years ago,
breast cancer.

10:49.448 --> 10:52.849
Thomas Booth was deployed
in a classified location at the time.

10:53.084 --> 10:54.676
Brandon's got a record.

10:54.853 --> 10:57.447
Vandalism, disturbing the peace,
resisting arrest.

10:57.656 --> 10:58.748
My Freud's a little rusty,

10:58.924 --> 11:01.825
but I don't think we're looking at a kid
capable of torture and murder.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.017
Thanks.

11:04.996 --> 11:06.463
You just name-dropped Freud.

11:06.631 --> 11:11.034
Well, dead father, rebellious son
who was close with the mother.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.931
Had to address the Oedipus
in the room.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.466
Uh, Brandon's not home.

11:16.441 --> 11:19.774
I'm his neighbor, also his landlady.
I knew his mom.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.277
Cut him a break on his rent.
He's had a rough time of it.

11:22.447 --> 11:25.109
We just wanna ask him
a few questions.

11:26.117 --> 11:28.449
He's at the diner down the street.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.882
You probably already know this,

11:30.055 --> 11:32.649
but they found his dad dead
in an empty lot this morning.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.950
We heard they had issues.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.616
They haven't spoken in the past
two years, since his mom died.

11:36.828 --> 11:39.456
- What kind of a selfish bastard...?
- Can you let us in?

11:40.532 --> 11:44.491
Last time I checked, this was a nation
that protected civil rights.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.035
Let's see your search warrant.

11:48.373 --> 11:49.806
Better make that call, G.

11:52.010 --> 11:55.537
Remember that information
I said we weren't gonna need?

11:55.714 --> 11:56.738
We need it.

11:56.915 --> 12:00.078
Ma'am, we're federal agents
investigating a homicide.

12:00.318 --> 12:01.785
Hundred dollars gets you in.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.284
What happened to civil rights?

12:04.656 --> 12:08.217
Does under-reporting rental income
for six years count as a civil right?

12:08.393 --> 12:12.489
I didn't hear that one mentioned
in the "I Have a Dream" speech.

12:13.298 --> 12:16.028
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.109
G, come check this out.

12:34.352 --> 12:35.910
Excuse me.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.019
Storage area.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.525
Huh. Brandon's a kickboxer.

12:50.335 --> 12:52.235
It's a loose board.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.231
Would you look at that?

13:11.856 --> 13:14.086
Look at that money.

13:14.259 --> 13:17.490
And I've been cutting him a break
on his rent all this time?

13:17.662 --> 13:18.822
Brandon?

13:18.997 --> 13:20.897
His dad's.

13:22.367 --> 13:25.063
This itinerary's for Thomas Booth.

13:26.471 --> 13:29.440
Thought you said they hadn't seen
each other in a couple years.

13:31.309 --> 13:33.470
Either Booth is using
his kid's house as a stash spot

13:33.645 --> 13:35.010
without his knowledge,

13:35.180 --> 13:38.445
or father and son are a lot closer
than anyone thought.

13:38.650 --> 13:42.347
This itinerary has a flight from LAX
to Peshawar Airport in Pakistan.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.817
Oh, I've been to Pakistan.

13:44.022 --> 13:46.286
But that food kept me
in the bathroom for a week.

13:46.491 --> 13:49.688
Say, I sure wouldn't want anyone
to accuse...

13:50.128 --> 13:52.323
Hey, lock up when you leave.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.328
Departure date?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.795
Today.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.431
Yeah, no, no, I got it. Okay, thanks.

14:01.606 --> 14:04.336
Hey. See the guy in the suit?

14:04.509 --> 14:07.637
Tailored one that costs
more than we make in a year?

14:07.812 --> 14:09.279
Yep.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.024
He's going.

14:22.193 --> 14:23.490
- Go, go, go.
- Hey, hey.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.688
Take the car, cut him off.

14:27.465 --> 14:30.161
What, so now I'm your sidekick?

15:05.370 --> 15:06.962
Hold it.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.873
Is this how Sam and Callen do it?

15:14.379 --> 15:16.779
One of them would crack
a funny one-liner right about now.

15:16.981 --> 15:18.505
Get up.

15:20.518 --> 15:23.351
- I'm waiting.
- You need to listen to me.

15:23.521 --> 15:24.920
Thank you, Deeks.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.081
You're making a mistake.

15:27.258 --> 15:31.786
Check inside my jacket pocket.
You'll find credentials.

15:39.571 --> 15:40.595
Put down the gun.

15:41.639 --> 15:42.936
What?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.735
Why?

15:45.443 --> 15:47.741
Diplomatic immunity.

15:59.289 --> 16:00.984
Your name is Jafar Khan?

16:01.158 --> 16:04.059
Yes, and I'm here voluntarily.

16:04.227 --> 16:08.186
Although I wouldn't mind seeing you
work a pair of handcuffs.

16:11.535 --> 16:14.800
Ah, American girls,
so health conscious.

16:14.971 --> 16:16.666
Why did you flee the scene?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.831
I'm an operative
for Inter-Services Intelligence.

16:19.009 --> 16:21.375
My superiors would prefer
I not be photographed.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.069
What brings you to Los Angeles?

16:23.246 --> 16:25.077
I'm an asset.

16:25.515 --> 16:28.245
United States
Joint Special Operations Command.

16:28.451 --> 16:29.577
And I have a specialty:

16:30.387 --> 16:32.582
High-value targets.

16:32.756 --> 16:34.348
Bounties of 1 million and up.

16:35.725 --> 16:37.886
Because you're not an employee
of the U.S. Government,

16:38.061 --> 16:39.722
you've pocketed a fortune
in reward money.

16:40.363 --> 16:43.491
I can think of worse ways
to make a living, Special Agent Blye.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.466
Who killed Thomas Booth?

16:46.670 --> 16:48.501
I don't know.

16:49.206 --> 16:50.264
Prove it.

16:51.174 --> 16:53.005
Voluntarily.

16:56.279 --> 16:58.577
- Pick up, 14.
- Hi.

16:58.748 --> 17:00.875
How was everything?

17:01.117 --> 17:02.846
As usual, it was great.

17:03.019 --> 17:04.577
I'm thinking about some dessert.

17:04.753 --> 17:06.381
There you go.

17:16.266 --> 17:17.756
Brandon Booth?

17:17.934 --> 17:19.424
What do you want?

17:20.237 --> 17:21.932
NCIS.

17:22.105 --> 17:24.800
Want to ask you some questions
about your father.

17:25.375 --> 17:28.070
My father? Okay, how about this?

17:28.278 --> 17:30.041
Lifelong soldier.
Delta Force hard-ass.

17:30.213 --> 17:32.977
Chest full of medals. Total stranger.

17:33.149 --> 17:35.640
You guys know more about him
than I do.

17:37.020 --> 17:39.011
Mom claimed
he was some kind of hero.

17:39.823 --> 17:41.984
I knew him as the most selfish person
I ever met.

17:42.158 --> 17:43.318
What do you mean, selfish?

17:44.227 --> 17:46.127
He was always
requesting deployments.

17:46.296 --> 17:47.888
Always wanted to go back. Why?

17:48.098 --> 17:49.395
The man had skills, Brandon.

17:49.566 --> 17:51.932
He made sacrifices
his country needed.

17:53.603 --> 17:54.968
I spent my 16th birthday

17:55.138 --> 17:57.902
watching my mother die
in a hospital bed.

17:58.074 --> 18:00.008
Dad was off doing things
he couldn't talk about

18:00.176 --> 18:02.610
in places he couldn't mention.

18:03.346 --> 18:05.314
Maybe we needed him, too.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.850
Last week was my 18th birthday.

18:10.053 --> 18:11.987
Spent it waiting for him to call.

18:13.189 --> 18:16.317
And I'm not sure
what pisses me off more.

18:16.493 --> 18:17.619
That he didn't call,

18:17.794 --> 18:20.092
or that I was dumb enough
to think that he might.

18:24.167 --> 18:25.964
Are you hungry?

18:29.205 --> 18:31.799
Does ISI know
you're working with JSOC?

18:31.975 --> 18:34.273
Of course.
If I didn't tell them, they'd find out.

18:34.444 --> 18:35.706
They're not the CIA, but...

18:35.879 --> 18:37.369
This can't be good.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.377
You shouldn't
have pulled your weapon.

18:39.582 --> 18:43.643
I hope you're not accusing me of being
a harbinger of doom, Mr. Deeks.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.048
What?

18:45.221 --> 18:47.451
No. A harbinger of doom?

18:47.624 --> 18:49.114
Of course not.

18:51.094 --> 18:54.689
You know,
this guy isn't just an informant

18:54.864 --> 18:58.027
for Joint Special
Operations Command.

18:58.201 --> 19:00.965
He's a bloody folk hero.

19:02.405 --> 19:07.035
He's put his life at risk
to help our cause.

19:07.210 --> 19:08.472
If terrorists knew

19:08.645 --> 19:13.309
that he was passing sensitive
information on to Americans,

19:13.516 --> 19:18.886
both Khan and his family
would meet brutal ends.

19:23.827 --> 19:25.920
Go ahead, Mr. Beale.

19:26.129 --> 19:28.393
I'm messaging you
Khan's dossier now, Hetty.

19:28.631 --> 19:31.395
It's a variety of files and images

19:31.568 --> 19:33.729
from Joint Special
Operations Command.

19:33.903 --> 19:35.928
You should be getting them now.

19:38.942 --> 19:40.842
Getting them, Eric.

19:41.077 --> 19:43.170
That's big game.

19:45.448 --> 19:48.542
Khan sends his tips on to JSOC.

19:48.718 --> 19:50.117
They vet the intel,

19:50.286 --> 19:53.722
and when the target's location
is confirmed,

19:53.923 --> 19:57.290
they send in Task Force 232
to eliminate them.

19:57.460 --> 20:01.624
The man has more than
13 million in reward money.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.288
Wow.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.228
Hey, Eric, do we have any information
on Khan's personal life?

20:07.437 --> 20:09.871
Yeah. Here it is.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.235
You getting that?

20:13.443 --> 20:14.535
Got it.

20:14.711 --> 20:17.179
Booth's former unit, 232.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.044
Booth and Khan were buddies.

20:20.216 --> 20:21.706
Booth filed for retirement,

20:21.918 --> 20:25.081
but kept getting calls
from his local sources in Afghanistan.

20:25.255 --> 20:27.780
He said he had a tip. A big one.

20:27.957 --> 20:30.152
Price on the target's head
was $10 million.

20:30.326 --> 20:32.055
He wanted to discuss it.

20:32.228 --> 20:33.752
But he never showed up.

20:33.930 --> 20:37.058
I got concerned and began
monitoring police scanner reports.

20:37.233 --> 20:40.634
When L.A.P.D. Discovered a body
matching Booth's description,

20:40.837 --> 20:42.668
I had to see for myself.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.069
Booth was a private citizen.

20:45.241 --> 20:48.699
He was gonna go back there, take out
the target himself and get rich.

20:48.912 --> 20:52.006
Thomas Booth and I
trusted each other.

20:52.782 --> 20:54.613
We were family.

20:56.286 --> 20:58.151
- Family?
- Yes.

20:58.321 --> 21:00.255
He was my brother-in-law.

21:01.424 --> 21:04.154
That's all Joint Special Operations
Command gave you on Khan?

21:04.327 --> 21:05.817
I'm betting more intel on him exists.

21:05.995 --> 21:07.690
The problem is,
he's too valuable an asset

21:07.864 --> 21:09.491
for them to reveal
as much as we'd like.

21:09.666 --> 21:12.032
Mm, government agencies
are territorial.

21:12.235 --> 21:14.169
If he's receiving
special treatment from one,

21:14.337 --> 21:16.635
it might put him
on the wrong side of another.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.467
But even if Khan
does have dirty laundry

21:18.641 --> 21:20.302
that JSOC hasn't told us about,

21:20.477 --> 21:21.967
how are you gonna find out
who has it?

21:23.279 --> 21:25.873
Khan's a cloak-and-dagger guy.

21:26.049 --> 21:29.951
He hasn't been hanging out
with the Department of Agriculture.

21:30.119 --> 21:32.747
Okay. What are you thinking, Nell?

21:34.958 --> 21:36.516
We found something in your house.

21:36.993 --> 21:39.223
A bag of things
that belonged to your father.

21:39.395 --> 21:42.728
You went through my stuff?
Can we get a check, like, right now?

21:42.899 --> 21:44.560
Did you know
he was keeping things?

21:44.801 --> 21:46.564
Seems strange,
given what you just told us

21:46.803 --> 21:48.134
about your relationship with him.

21:48.304 --> 21:50.966
Doesn't make any sense. Last time
I saw him was two years ago.

21:51.174 --> 21:52.971
Why was he stashing things
on your property?

21:53.176 --> 21:54.404
- I don't know.
- Brandon.

21:54.644 --> 21:56.976
I know what it's like to not
wanna talk about your family,

21:57.146 --> 21:58.511
especially to guys like us.

21:58.715 --> 22:00.876
But your dad was headed back
to the Middle East.

22:01.084 --> 22:03.575
If he came to you for anything at all,
you need to tell us.

22:03.786 --> 22:05.413
Look, I didn't know him at all.

22:07.524 --> 22:08.650
G.

22:08.858 --> 22:10.689
It's a little warm for an overcoat.

22:12.562 --> 22:13.995
Gun.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.883
- You good?
- Yeah.

22:34.050 --> 22:35.813
Where's the kid?

22:39.756 --> 22:41.223
Gone.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.329
Booth married my sister Yasmin
almost 20 years ago.

22:55.537 --> 22:59.473
I had just started at ISI.
He was a young Army recruit.

22:59.641 --> 23:02.667
We became close friends.
A spy and a soldier.

23:02.844 --> 23:05.312
Different sides of the same coin.

23:05.547 --> 23:07.276
- Like brothers.
- Booth.

23:07.449 --> 23:09.576
He brought you into JSOC.

23:10.285 --> 23:12.617
The high-value targets,
the bounties.

23:13.155 --> 23:14.986
What was the tip
he wanted to discuss?

23:15.190 --> 23:18.159
He didn't get into specifics
over the phone. Too risky.

23:18.326 --> 23:22.126
He said it involved the location
of the Taliban's master bomb-maker,

23:22.330 --> 23:23.661
Kasi Shariff.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.658
In 48 hours, the location goes cold,

23:28.870 --> 23:31.338
and their bomb-maker
will get away.

23:31.573 --> 23:33.336
I'm reviewing traffic cams
around the diner

23:33.508 --> 23:35.499
and working on tracing
Brandon Booth's cell phone.

23:35.677 --> 23:36.837
Keep looking. He's in danger.

23:37.012 --> 23:38.343
What do we have on the shooters?

23:38.513 --> 23:40.447
Afghani citizens
with ties to the Taliban.

23:40.615 --> 23:43.049
Their fingerprints match the ones
on the car L.A.P.D. Found.

23:43.218 --> 23:45.618
Taliban?
They're a long way from home.

23:45.787 --> 23:46.981
They kidnapped Booth.

23:47.155 --> 23:49.214
They were protecting what
he was gonna go after...

23:49.457 --> 23:53.018
Or they were going after the target,
too, and they wanted what he knew.

23:53.595 --> 23:55.859
One of the shooters
was carrying a burn phone.

23:56.031 --> 23:58.693
Series of text messages
with addresses.

23:58.867 --> 24:00.334
The garage where Booth
was snatched,

24:00.502 --> 24:02.060
the location
where his body was dumped,

24:02.237 --> 24:03.295
Brandon Booth's house.

24:03.471 --> 24:04.802
Someone was giving them orders.

24:05.473 --> 24:08.840
Were you able to dig anything else up
on the Pakistani spy, Jafar Khan?

24:09.010 --> 24:10.068
No. But I'm still looking.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.410
Yo. Hold on.

24:14.616 --> 24:16.607
Guys, it's Deeks.

24:16.818 --> 24:17.876
Go ahead.

24:18.053 --> 24:20.715
Booth was killed because he knew
the whereabouts of the Taliban's

24:20.889 --> 24:21.981
master bomb-maker.

24:22.157 --> 24:23.988
The guy has a $10 million bounty
on his head.

24:24.159 --> 24:26.423
One of the top five
most wanted men in the world,

24:26.661 --> 24:27.685
Kasi Shariff.

24:27.863 --> 24:31.094
This man was behind
the police academy bombing

24:31.266 --> 24:36.033
last month in Kabul,
which killed 189 people.

24:36.204 --> 24:40.868
Weekends, he teaches teenagers
how to rig a dead dog

24:41.042 --> 24:44.739
so full of thermite
that it takes out an Abrams tank.

24:44.913 --> 24:48.576
And whoever is running the shooters
now has Booth's intel as well.

24:49.351 --> 24:52.286
Shooters went after Brandon Booth
because they think he knows about it.

24:52.454 --> 24:54.888
Is it possible Brandon knows
something he's not telling us?

24:55.056 --> 24:57.024
The clock is ticking,
because according to Khan,

24:57.192 --> 24:59.353
this intel is only good
for another 48 hours.

24:59.527 --> 25:01.290
Just because Booth
did it for the money

25:01.529 --> 25:03.360
doesn't mean
he wasn't doing the right thing.

25:03.531 --> 25:05.556
If the target gets away,
he died for nothing.

25:05.734 --> 25:08.294
Our work is cut out for us,
gentlemen.

25:08.470 --> 25:10.301
Locate Booth's killer,

25:10.538 --> 25:14.565
and he'll give us the intel we need
to take out this Taliban bomber.

25:14.743 --> 25:15.937
Lose him,

25:16.544 --> 25:21.811
and those 189 blast victims in Kabul
won't be his last.

25:23.318 --> 25:25.286
Send a text.

25:25.453 --> 25:27.785
Whoever's giving orders
may not know their guys are dead.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.479
We may get something.

25:29.824 --> 25:31.758
We go in undercover, make contact,
get answers.

25:36.798 --> 25:38.129
It's an address in Thai Town.

25:38.967 --> 25:41.800
- How's your Pashto, Sam?
- It's better than yours.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.801
Find Brandon Booth.

25:43.972 --> 25:45.303
You can meditate on the way over.

25:45.473 --> 25:48.931
I'll reflect on Zen and the art
of locking your ass in the trunk.

25:49.144 --> 25:50.270
I'll work my contacts.

25:50.445 --> 25:53.073
If anything comes up,
you'll be my first call.

25:53.281 --> 25:54.646
Sounds good.

25:55.317 --> 25:58.218
- I was talking to Agent Blye.
- Yeah.

26:06.461 --> 26:07.860
What?

26:08.029 --> 26:09.496
You slipped James Bond
your number?

26:09.731 --> 26:11.130
For case purposes only.

26:12.233 --> 26:15.930
How long did it take for Callen
and Sam to trust each other?

26:22.377 --> 26:25.244
Uh, New Year's Day 2007.

26:26.381 --> 26:28.110
What happened?

26:29.284 --> 26:34.312
Oh, uh, they'd only been partners
for a month, and it wasn't going well.

26:34.489 --> 26:37.253
No chemistry at all.

26:37.892 --> 26:41.953
Mr. Callen went undercover
to meet the Armenian mob.

26:42.163 --> 26:45.291
Mr. Hanna stayed outside
as backup,

26:45.467 --> 26:48.994
but saw that his new partner
was badly outnumbered.

26:49.971 --> 26:55.136
He moved in a little closer,
but was caught by a sentry.

26:55.343 --> 26:58.972
Sam was dragged before Callen.

26:59.180 --> 27:02.206
The mob boss handed Callen a gun,

27:02.384 --> 27:05.876
and demanded
that he prove his loyalty,

27:06.054 --> 27:08.249
or they'd both be killed on the spot.

27:08.423 --> 27:13.292
Callen pointed the gun at Sam's head
and pulled the trigger.

27:14.195 --> 27:16.891
The gun dry-fired.

27:17.098 --> 27:18.565
It was empty.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.427
They went on to solve the case.

27:20.602 --> 27:24.060
Afterwards, Mr. Callen said

27:24.239 --> 27:28.676
he knew the gun wasn't loaded
because of its weight.

27:28.877 --> 27:30.435
And Sam believed him?

27:31.579 --> 27:34.548
Why else would Mr. Callen
pull the trigger?

27:36.751 --> 27:38.946
That's a pretty big leap of faith.

27:42.123 --> 27:44.182
That's trust.

27:50.965 --> 27:54.366
Location is the condemned gym
across the street.

27:56.037 --> 27:57.971
I'll tell them
we're willing to cut a deal.

27:58.206 --> 28:01.039
Betray NCIS for a payday.
Gain their trust.

28:01.209 --> 28:03.404
They'll take me
to who's at the top of the food chain.

28:03.611 --> 28:06.136
Move fast, because time's running out
on Booth's intel.

28:06.381 --> 28:10.215
We find his killer, we still got
a shot at this Taliban bomb-maker.

28:17.392 --> 28:20.088
Callen, we got a lock
on Brandon Booth's cell phone.

28:20.261 --> 28:24.220
Looks like he's on foot
just off La Brea and Fountain.

28:26.067 --> 28:28.501
Kensi, Deeks,
keep an eye on Brandon.

28:28.670 --> 28:30.331
You sure he's not involved?

28:30.505 --> 28:33.736
He's Booth's son.
Jafar Khan is his uncle.

28:33.908 --> 28:35.603
Right now,
we can't be sure of anything.

28:35.777 --> 28:37.369
Okay.

29:17.852 --> 29:19.877
Stop right there. Don't look at me.

29:20.054 --> 29:21.214
Face forward.

29:21.422 --> 29:23.982
You're going to be searched
and disarmed.

29:25.126 --> 29:27.560
I'm a federal agent assigned
to Thomas Booth's murder.

29:27.729 --> 29:30.197
I know the tip he was sitting on.

29:30.565 --> 29:34.433
Meet my asking price,
I won't turn it over to my superiors.

29:37.338 --> 29:39.431
I'm here to cut a deal.

29:44.812 --> 29:46.040
My men have been captured.

29:46.247 --> 29:48.442
Killed. By me.

29:51.452 --> 29:53.010
How do you know
about Booth's intel?

29:53.221 --> 29:54.745
Hidden in Booth's son's house.

29:54.956 --> 29:57.754
The exact location
of the Taliban's bomb-maker.

29:58.259 --> 30:00.557
- You're bluffing.
- I fail-safed the information.

30:00.728 --> 30:02.355
If I don't place a call
once every hour,

30:02.530 --> 30:05.055
it goes straight to the Joint
Special Operations Command.

30:06.367 --> 30:08.665
Pay me off
and the tip stays a secret.

30:09.404 --> 30:11.599
I'm only negotiating
with the guy running the show.

30:11.839 --> 30:13.204
And don't tell me it's you.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.608
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

30:16.277 --> 30:18.871
What are you willing to offer me?

30:20.114 --> 30:21.376
I have a partner.

30:22.517 --> 30:25.077
- He knows what you know?
- Yes.

30:25.887 --> 30:27.787
I hand him over to you.

30:27.989 --> 30:30.480
I killed your men,
you do what you want with him.

30:31.025 --> 30:32.754
Betrayal comes easy to you.

30:33.261 --> 30:35.422
It's the cost of doing business.

31:02.624 --> 31:04.216
What the hell are you doing?

31:04.392 --> 31:05.723
Shut up.

31:05.893 --> 31:08.088
You guys make whatever calls
you need to make.

31:08.263 --> 31:09.958
You have one minute
to come to a decision.

31:10.131 --> 31:12.099
He's collateral damage
as far as I'm concerned.

31:12.267 --> 31:13.427
I won't need a minute.

31:13.601 --> 31:16.570
I thought you were bluffing me then
and I think you're bluffing me now.

31:16.771 --> 31:17.795
Wait a minute.

31:17.972 --> 31:20.133
I came here to show you
I meant business.

31:20.975 --> 31:22.943
Now put down the guns
and let's make a deal.

31:23.144 --> 31:24.941
Nice plan. Hope it was worth it.

31:25.146 --> 31:27.740
I can get them to change their minds
in less than 10 seconds.

31:27.915 --> 31:30.281
Right, you'll get what you deserve,
you greedy...

31:37.959 --> 31:41.486
- That's nine.
- Nine what?

31:42.363 --> 31:44.297
Times we've done the

31:44.465 --> 31:48.663
"corrupt agent betrays his partner"
routine.

31:48.836 --> 31:50.929
I didn't know
you were keeping count.

31:51.105 --> 31:52.333
You'd keep track, too,

31:52.507 --> 31:54.771
if you're the one
getting the knee to the solar plexus.

31:54.976 --> 31:56.443
I got a light touch, G.

32:00.715 --> 32:01.977
They're both dead.

32:04.819 --> 32:06.184
Damn it.

32:09.724 --> 32:13.091
Which means we're no closer
to finding out who's behind this.

32:13.695 --> 32:15.720
Back to square one.

32:29.776 --> 32:31.607
Brandon Booth?

32:31.945 --> 32:33.435
Do you want
to talk about my dad, too?

32:33.613 --> 32:35.491
Last time someone asked
about him, I almost got killed.

32:35.515 --> 32:37.176
We're just here
to make sure you're safe.

32:37.350 --> 32:40.911
You don't have to talk about your dad.
God knows I'm not talking about mine.

32:41.087 --> 32:42.850
You feel like talking
about your dad at all?

32:43.022 --> 32:44.148
- Not a chance.
- See?

32:44.324 --> 32:46.189
We're all on the same page.

32:46.359 --> 32:48.953
- I live a few blocks away.
- All right, we'll give you a ride.

32:49.128 --> 32:51.221
Car's just around the corner.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.199
So Van Nuys High, huh?

32:56.369 --> 32:59.031
You either ran a search on me
or that was a lucky guess.

32:59.238 --> 33:03.004
It's obvious, you're not the only person
who grew up in Los Angeles.

33:03.643 --> 33:05.668
- Reseda.
- Bingo.

33:05.845 --> 33:08.279
I hated Reseda guys.

33:08.448 --> 33:11.440
You know, Van Nuys used to
have the hottest girls back in the day.

33:11.651 --> 33:14.518
Still does. But they got attitude.

33:14.687 --> 33:17.019
They all got attitude.

33:25.665 --> 33:27.132
Hold on.

33:37.677 --> 33:38.701
It's clear, Kensi.

33:38.878 --> 33:40.209
Backyard's clear. Coming.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.870
Okay.

33:49.088 --> 33:52.717
- Someone's birthday?
- Yeah, it's my dad's handwriting.

33:52.892 --> 33:55.588
Only a week late this time.
So typical.

33:55.828 --> 33:57.557
You gonna open it?

33:57.997 --> 33:59.328
No.

34:03.369 --> 34:05.360
You know, I was, uh...

34:05.738 --> 34:07.831
After high school,
I didn't have any plans.

34:08.007 --> 34:11.204
You know, no job,
didn't know about college.

34:11.411 --> 34:12.708
I know the feeling.

34:12.911 --> 34:14.607
Yeah.

34:15.114 --> 34:16.445
My dad and I are polar opposites.

34:16.616 --> 34:18.914
He's the kind of guy
that looks six different directions

34:19.085 --> 34:20.552
before he crosses the street.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.553
He actually said to me one time,
"If you don't get your act together,

34:23.723 --> 34:25.850
you're gonna spend your life
trapped in this town."

34:26.059 --> 34:29.551
Just like every other loser that's too
scared to venture out in the world

34:29.728 --> 34:31.356
and make his mark and...

34:31.531 --> 34:32.862
So when did you do it?

34:33.065 --> 34:34.192
When did I do what?

34:34.400 --> 34:35.924
Move out of L.A.,
conquer your demons,

34:36.101 --> 34:37.592
prove the old man wrong?

34:37.837 --> 34:40.931
That's the next chapter
of this little pep talk, right?

34:41.706 --> 34:43.368
To this day,
I've never lived further away

34:43.543 --> 34:46.137
than two miles
from the house that I grew up in.

34:50.850 --> 34:53.784
Eric just sent me
Brandon's cell phone log.

34:53.953 --> 34:56.478
He called Jafar Khan
three times today.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.785
So? He's my uncle.

34:58.991 --> 35:00.083
When I heard about my dad,

35:00.259 --> 35:02.750
Uncle Jafar was the only family
I had left to call.

35:08.267 --> 35:09.427
Okay, I'll handle this.

35:10.636 --> 35:11.933
Okay.

35:12.105 --> 35:15.006
- Callen wants us back at Ops.
- All right.

35:19.445 --> 35:22.073
- I'm telling the truth.
- I believe you.

35:22.248 --> 35:24.682
But if I come back here looking for you
and you're not here,

35:24.884 --> 35:27.648
I'm gonna find you.
You know that, right?

35:28.154 --> 35:29.951
Okay.

35:30.923 --> 35:31.981
Wait.

35:34.127 --> 35:36.595
Do you ever wonder
what your dad thinks about you?

35:39.165 --> 35:40.655
No.

35:42.034 --> 35:44.264
He never got it, anyway.

35:45.438 --> 35:47.099
Dude moved to Iowa.

36:18.538 --> 36:20.165
What is that?

36:20.573 --> 36:22.666
It's probably nothing.

36:26.445 --> 36:29.676
Jafar Khan may be loved by
Joint Special Operations Command,

36:29.849 --> 36:33.580
but once upon a time,
he had another patron saint. The CIA.

36:33.753 --> 36:36.085
It was a messy break-up,
so it didn't take much convincing

36:36.255 --> 36:38.382
to get Langley to slip me the file
they kept on him.

36:38.558 --> 36:40.025
What was Khan doing for the CIA?

36:40.193 --> 36:42.525
Well, from 2002 to 2005,

36:42.695 --> 36:44.322
they outsourced interrogations

36:44.497 --> 36:46.590
of terror suspects
to nations that weren't,

36:46.832 --> 36:49.323
well, overly concerned
with human rights.

36:49.502 --> 36:51.493
Pakistan being one of them.

36:51.671 --> 36:57.337
Seems Jafar Khan had
a very specific style of questioning.

36:57.510 --> 37:00.206
We've seen
those body markings before.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.274
Booth's body was in the exact
same condition when we found it.

37:03.516 --> 37:05.450
Khan did this to his own
brother-in-law

37:05.618 --> 37:07.779
so he could have
the bounty for himself.

37:08.354 --> 37:09.878
See if there's anything there?

37:10.056 --> 37:13.219
Booth mailed it to Brandon
the day he was killed.

37:13.392 --> 37:14.916
Eric, where is Kahn now?

37:15.127 --> 37:17.994
ISI's refusing
to divulge his whereabouts.

37:18.931 --> 37:21.058
Hey, hey, check this out.

37:21.867 --> 37:23.061
What are we looking at?

37:23.236 --> 37:26.865
It's a spectron seal,
invisible to the naked eye.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.267
This photo is not an original.

37:28.441 --> 37:30.807
It's a scan,
with a seal embedded into it.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.604
The pattern contains
some sort of message.

37:35.881 --> 37:38.441
- It's a series of numbers.
- Or coordinates.

37:38.618 --> 37:41.280
Latitude and longitude
with a time stamp.

37:46.058 --> 37:48.618
That's somewhere in Afghanistan.

37:50.463 --> 37:52.954
Location corresponds
to a teahouse

37:53.165 --> 37:55.895
in Afghanistan's
Hindu Kush mountain range.

37:56.068 --> 37:59.037
- The time stamp is...
- Thirty-six hours from right now.

37:59.238 --> 38:00.796
This is Booth's tip.

38:00.973 --> 38:04.272
Booth knew if anything happened
to him, there'd be an investigation.

38:04.443 --> 38:07.503
He also knew that
we'd question his son.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.978
He didn't send the intel
for Brandon to find.

38:10.149 --> 38:11.275
He sent it to us.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.577
Khan said we had 48 hours
before the tip went bad,

38:13.753 --> 38:16.813
but according to this embedded
message, his intel's late.

38:17.056 --> 38:18.751
He's eight hours behind.

38:20.626 --> 38:22.617
Booth misled him on purpose.

38:22.828 --> 38:24.125
By the time Khan gets there,

38:24.297 --> 38:26.458
the high-value target's
gonna be long gone.

38:28.267 --> 38:29.825
But Khan won't know that.

38:32.004 --> 38:34.131
I sense impending mayhem,

38:34.307 --> 38:37.299
and perhaps
an outrageous petty cash request.

38:37.510 --> 38:39.341
One simple question, Hetty.

38:39.945 --> 38:41.207
Do you trust us?

39:18.651 --> 39:21.711
- Kasi Shariff?
- Glad you could join us.

39:23.422 --> 39:25.413
Reimbursing my boss
for travel expenses

39:25.624 --> 39:27.751
would have set me back
in a major way.

39:28.828 --> 39:30.318
Booth played you.

39:32.031 --> 39:34.158
Task Force 232 got here hours ago.

39:35.034 --> 39:37.867
Bagged the Taliban's
master bomb-maker.

39:38.571 --> 39:40.869
Your immunity isn't valid
in Afghanistan, is it?

39:42.241 --> 39:44.175
- Drop it.
- He said drop the gun.

39:45.778 --> 39:47.837
Secure that weapon.

39:49.148 --> 39:50.342
Let's go.

39:50.549 --> 39:52.039
Come on.

39:52.251 --> 39:54.617
Everything's negotiable
when you know what I know.

39:54.787 --> 39:56.049
Remember that.

39:56.255 --> 39:58.018
Get him out of here,
Sergeant Weaver.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.555
You got it.

40:02.595 --> 40:06.429
I can't believe Hetty
authorized us to do this in person.

40:07.533 --> 40:10.525
We had her at the word "tea."

40:13.606 --> 40:15.870
Deeks? What's up?

40:16.075 --> 40:17.770
Hey, um...

40:18.677 --> 40:20.269
I just came to give you this.

40:22.415 --> 40:24.110
I threw this out for a reason.

40:24.316 --> 40:26.409
I know.
And I'm not telling you to open it.

40:27.052 --> 40:30.249
All right? All I'm doing
is giving you another chance.

40:30.823 --> 40:33.053
If you feel like it.

41:12.164 --> 41:13.722
What is that on your fingers?

41:17.970 --> 41:18.994
That's nothing.

41:26.545 --> 41:29.480
I carry a Beretta 92FS
because the manual safety

41:29.682 --> 41:32.776
saved my ass one time during a
gun snatch attempt by a junkie.

41:32.952 --> 41:35.045
And if the magazine ever jams,

41:35.254 --> 41:37.814
I can just pop a bullet
straight into the chamber.

41:43.062 --> 41:44.620
Take a look.

41:46.499 --> 41:48.524
Maybe some other time.

41:58.143 --> 42:01.408
- Hey.
- Hey, welcome back, guys.

42:10.823 --> 42:12.085
Is he staring at us?

42:12.324 --> 42:13.586
Yeah.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.987
No, I just...
What I wanted to say is that l...

42:16.161 --> 42:18.254
I heard about the whole
2007 New Year's Day,

42:18.430 --> 42:21.263
you know, with the Armenian mob,
when they came in and dragged the...

42:21.433 --> 42:23.162
This actually went better in my head.

42:23.335 --> 42:26.202
I'm derailing. Let me finish. Um...

42:27.740 --> 42:29.765
I have a lot of admiration

42:29.942 --> 42:33.810
for the trust
that you two have in each other.

42:37.683 --> 42:39.173
That's it.

42:40.686 --> 42:43.120
Okay. Uh, good night.

42:47.826 --> 42:49.851
What the hell's he talking about?

42:50.029 --> 42:52.088
Armenian mob?

42:52.464 --> 42:54.523
No idea.

43:08.347 --> 43:11.248
Oh, goody. Tea.
