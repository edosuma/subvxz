00:02.969 --> 00:05.437
Why would you ever agree
to help Wilhelmina?

00:05.505 --> 00:07.666
- Can we talk about it?
- Hi, Daddy.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.902
- Alex?
- Bradford Meade won't be able

00:09.976 --> 00:12.945
- to keep his hands off you.
- That's the idea.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.676
- I saw you acting crazy and I...
- Your day is over. Punch out!

00:16.750 --> 00:19.719
So are you giving Petra
the May cover or the June?

00:19.786 --> 00:22.619
- What are you, also her manager?
- I'm her mother.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.819
- Petra is 16?
- You didn't ask to see ID, did you?

00:26.893 --> 00:29.361
It's Daniel. Sounds like
he might be in trouble.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.589
I punched out.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.312
- Betty! What are you doing here?
- I sleep here!

00:54.387 --> 00:57.584
What are you doing sneaking in
my window like you're in high school?

00:57.657 --> 01:00.091
I was out last night... with Santos.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.651
But I don't want Papi to know,
or Justin yet.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.165
I don't even know if this is
"I love you" or just, you know,

01:06.232 --> 01:09.531
- "I love you naked."
- OK, so you are back in high school.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.594
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

01:12.672 --> 01:14.071
I'm calling in sick.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.234
What, are you still mad
at everyone there?

01:17.310 --> 01:20.040
Why wouldn't I be?
Christina's my best friend.

01:20.113 --> 01:23.344
I confided things to her
and she went and told Wilhelmina.

01:23.416 --> 01:27.614
And Daniel told me to butt out of
his life, that I'm just his secretary.

01:29.289 --> 01:32.258
- And Henry...
- Well, what did he do?

01:32.325 --> 01:35.726
Nothing. But he has a girlfriend.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.127
And that's just
the cherry on the sundae.

01:39.332 --> 01:43.462
- Would you like a sundae?
- Maybe.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.970
Tough! It's Monday.
Go to work. Be an adult.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.564
Said the girl with the leaf in her hair.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.701
I'm just saying,
a job is not about making friends,

01:51.778 --> 01:54.713
it's about making money.
And stealing office supplies.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.682
By the way, we're out of coffee filters.

02:00.587 --> 02:04.079
Well, that's certainly a nice way
to wake up in the morning.

[Wilhelmina] Think of me
as your cafe au lait.

02:09.529 --> 02:15.092
I wish I didn't have to leave. I am not
looking forward to my meeting with Alex.

02:15.168 --> 02:19.468
You poor dear.
Do you want to talk about it?

02:19.539 --> 02:22.007
No, no, no. It's my problem.
I'll deal with it.

02:22.075 --> 02:26.978
Bradford, I hope you don't just think
of me as your morning pick-me-up.

02:27.046 --> 02:30.447
I'd like to think
I'm an important part of your life.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.611
Someone you can talk to.

02:34.754 --> 02:38.212
You know, if you really want
to take my mind off things...

Stop laughing. You'll get wrinkles.

03:07.587 --> 03:12.115
Look, I put together some money.
Here's $ 75,000.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.992
- That enough to forget this happened?
- This isn't about money.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.825
This is about Petra's career.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.730
She's going to be the next Kate Moss.
But not a piggy.

<i>OK, look, we have a big photo shoot
with our sister magazine Mode Brazil.</i>

03:26.239 --> 03:30.039
- I think I can probably get you in.
- Ooh, I already have the wax.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.202
Shut up, Petra.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.072
Nice try, Mr. Meade.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.550
But she's not interested
in a corner picture on page 80.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.519
It is the cover or jail.

03:42.155 --> 03:46.216
Come on, Petra, you must be starving.
Let's get you a club soda.

left your pants there Tuesday night.

- Not necessary.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.890
Oh. The cafeteria is out of bagels.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.398
I'm going to the kiosk.
Can I get you something else?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.867
You're really not gonna
let me say anything?

04:29.936 --> 04:34.703
You said it. You're my boss and I'm just
your assistant. I'll be back in ten.

and when the finish line approaches,

04:56.596 --> 04:58.757
he starts howling like a wounded beagle.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.493
Sexy. Is it really worth it?

05:01.567 --> 05:05.094
Well, the only way I can run this empire
is if I marry that horn dog.

05:05.171 --> 05:08.902
What about Claire,
the current Mrs. Horn Dog?

Pretty sure she was drunk-dialing.

keeps sniffing around.

throw away the messages from Christina.

month and that's it? You're a citizen?

Pretty much. My new lawyer
says I'm on the fast track.

I know this is a little uncomfortable,
but rinsing the hair with cold water

Your lunch with Donna is canceled,

13:50.896 --> 13:55.595
Liz from Commes des Garcons
needs to talk to you ASAP and... Oh.

13:55.668 --> 14:00.401
Ta-da! Here you go! He won't even be
able to keep the remote up tonight.

14:00.472 --> 14:04.374
- What did you replace them with?
- It's better if you don't know.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.468
I'm just kidding, it's mints!

14:08.848 --> 14:12.079
Oh, my God. When I die,
I want to be cremated and...

14:12.151 --> 14:13.641
Already did it!

14:13.719 --> 14:17.018
- Where did you get that jacket?
- A new up-and-coming designer.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.717
Tavares.
No last name because he's that good.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.785
Well, the buttons totally ruin the line,
but besides that, I don't hate it.

14:23.863 --> 14:28.061
- Why don't I know about him?
- Oh, um... Well, he...

14:28.133 --> 14:30.499
- He...
- I think he's in your book for Tuesday.

14:31.637 --> 14:35.334
- Good work, Marc.
- Yeah, Marc, good work.

14:35.407 --> 14:41.141
No, this is wrong. Wrong.
Take five. Touch-ups?

14:41.213 --> 14:45.343
Why don't you go and ask someone
what global warming is?

14:49.455 --> 14:54.188
I think your models are depressed.
Everyone in New York is depressed.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.525
In my country, a woman buries
her husband, throws on a bikini

14:57.596 --> 14:59.223
and goes to the beach!

14:59.298 --> 15:02.859
But a black bikini,
because she still has to mourn.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.368
Yeah, of course.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.705
<i>Rodrigo Veloso,
creative director of Mode Brazil.</i>

15:10.309 --> 15:11.708
- Alexis...
- Meade.

15:11.777 --> 15:15.213
I always know the name of the
most beautiful woman in the room.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.977
I mean, clearly they're not my friends.

15:21.053 --> 15:25.513
Maybe I should just start over,
find new people who won't let me down.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.287
- What is that?
- That's my wise hairdresser's nod.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.158
They say you gotta do it,
even if you're not listening.

15:31.230 --> 15:35.291
I was, I was! Calm down.
And you know what I think?

15:35.367 --> 15:38.302
- You're too hard on your friends.
- Are you kidding me?

15:38.370 --> 15:41.601
- You are! You always have been.
- You are, Aunt Betty.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.872
You guys don't know what
you're talking about. I'm outta here.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.348
OK. Well, I have two words for you:
Trina DiPaolo.

15:55.187 --> 15:58.054
Mr. Meade? Uh, Daniel?

15:58.123 --> 16:00.523
If you're looking for Betty,
she's not here.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.060
Yeah, I know. It's not...

16:03.128 --> 16:07.690
It's just about the
$ 75,000 check I cut for you.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.894
It's kind of
a big miscellaneous expense,

16:10.970 --> 16:15.373
- if you could tell me what it's for...
- Henry, you don't have to hide it.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.432
You can have the check back.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.906
I'm not gonna need it in prison.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.176
[Reggaeton plays]

16:28.320 --> 16:31.255
I can't believe you would
even say that name to me.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.814
- Who's Trina?
- Betty's friend in high school

16:33.892 --> 16:35.826
- until she ended it.
- No!

16:35.894 --> 16:39.625
Trina is the one who ended it
when she ruined our anti-prom.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.256
What's an anti-prom?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.860
It was our celebration
of how much we hated the prom.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.768
I loved my prom.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.037
And nine months later,
I had a wonderful reminder of it.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.099
[Kisses]

16:52.177 --> 16:54.873
Trina and I planned
our anti-prom for months.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.916
We knew no boys were going to ask us,
so we stayed home

16:57.983 --> 17:00.508
<i>and we ate cookie dough
and we rented Carrie...</i>

17:00.586 --> 17:04.021
- Classic girl rage.
- Do you want to hear what happened?

17:04.490 --> 17:08.290
<i>[Betty] So we were sitting on the couch
watching Carrie...</i>

17:08.359 --> 17:10.624
- Can I look?
- Oh, my God.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.755
You two losers are doing this?

17:12.830 --> 17:15.664
Yeah, the gym teacher just got cut
in half. You can look now.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.258
- [Screams]
- [Laughing]

17:17.336 --> 17:20.362
- Trina! Not funny!
- Move over. Move.

17:20.439 --> 17:24.842
Oh, my God, John Travolta was hot.
What happened?

17:24.910 --> 17:26.707
And then Trina got a phone call

17:26.779 --> 17:29.942
and it turned into one
of the worst nights of my life.

17:30.015 --> 17:33.416
- You're leaving me to go to the prom?
- Betty, it's Sam Pappas!

17:33.485 --> 17:36.010
I've had a crush on him
since he put gum in my hair.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.648
His date got chickenpox
and he has no one to go with.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.316
It's a prom night miracle.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.988
But we made a pact in Yearbook
Committee! This is our anti-prom!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.862
You're sad and pathetic
and will never have a boyfriend.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.093
Traitor.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.882
No!

18:06.952 --> 18:08.044
[Hilda] Pig's blood?

18:08.120 --> 18:12.489
[Chuckles] OK, I was there,
and that's not what happened at all.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.426
Listen, we made a pact in Yearbook
Committee! This is our anti-prom!

18:16.495 --> 18:19.157
I know.
And I know it's sad and pathetic,

18:19.231 --> 18:22.394
but this is the closest I'll ever get
to having a boyfriend.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.732
Just go, you traitor.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.534
Please understand. Betty...

18:35.380 --> 18:38.508
OK, maybe I embellished a little,

18:38.584 --> 18:41.382
but it may as well have been blood.
That's what it felt like.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.047
Aunt Betty, you are so theater.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.149
She called you for days
and you never returned her calls.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.490
You shut her out
because she made one mistake.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.053
- Well, it was a big one!
- Yeah? Was it worth it?

18:54.566 --> 18:57.831
How was the rest of your school year?
Who'd you eat lunch with?

18:57.903 --> 19:01.737
- The lunch ladies.
- Was it Eleanor? She is such a gossip.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.469
OK, hairapist,
what would you have done?

19:04.543 --> 19:06.568
I'd have told Trina
how that made me feel.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.240
And that's what you should be doing
with Daniel and Christina.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.579
- It's too hard.
- Why, Betty?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.482
Don't want to see how hurt you are?

19:14.553 --> 19:17.852
Afraid that you're gonna lose them?
Haven't you already?

19:17.923 --> 19:20.824
I thought you said jobs
were just about paychecks.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.622
Obviously, not for you.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.295
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.236
Never known anyone
who's been blackmailed before.

19:33.305 --> 19:36.706
<i>It's so All My Children,
which I used to watch with my mother,</i>

19:36.775 --> 19:39.039
and... I don't know
why I just said that.

19:39.111 --> 19:43.605
Look, I'm sorry
I dumped all this on you.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.583
I guess I needed to talk to someone.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.618
There aren't many people
here to do that with.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.419
Yeah, I miss Betty too.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.428
She warned me about screwing up.

19:58.263 --> 20:03.394
I know I was drunk, but I never
thought Petra could be underage.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.232
- Sounds like you were set up.
- Doesn't change anything.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.768
Maybe I should face the consequences.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.833
No, you have to get Alexis
to put Petra on the cover.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.503
Look, I tried that.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.741
Tell her what's going on,
then she'll do it.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.249
Yeah, you don't know Alexis.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.879
She is family.
Has to count for something.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.554
Oh, and Wilhelmina flipped
for the jacket you gave me.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.255
- How much do you love me?
- It's Matt Damon, and then you.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.821
Oh, one thing. She hated those buttons.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.231
Got them on anything else, burn them.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.462
- Really?
- Now that I think about it,

20:38.537 --> 20:40.903
take the sequins off
that black cocktail.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.066
Sequins remind her
of the bad times at 54.

20:43.141 --> 20:47.805
What about the capris?
How does she feel about tortoiseshell?

20:47.879 --> 20:50.609
<i>OK, OK, OK. Mucho, mucho big favor.</i>

20:50.682 --> 20:53.651
Could you please come
to my studio tonight and tell me

20:53.719 --> 20:57.246
what Miss Slater will love
and what she will hate? Please?

20:57.322 --> 20:59.051
This is a big opportunity for me.

20:59.124 --> 21:03.356
Well, if fashion duty calls.
And I do love free clothes.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.591
- There will be free clothes, right?
- Plenty.

21:06.665 --> 21:10.328
[Soft jazz playing]

21:10.402 --> 21:12.529
[Camera clicking]

21:12.604 --> 21:15.300
After the shoot,
perhaps you will join me for dinner.

21:15.374 --> 21:19.572
There's this little restaurant I know.
And I would love to take you there.

21:20.912 --> 21:26.714
I'm afraid I have a lot of work to do.
But thank you for the invitation.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.983
I'll keep myself available,
in case you change your mind.

21:35.027 --> 21:39.896
I see you've met Rodrigo.
Quite a specimen, isn't he?

21:41.166 --> 21:44.897
I guess. He asked me out to dinner.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.404
- And you said?
- No.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.837
Alexis! Why?

21:48.907 --> 21:53.901
Because it's dinner and that means sex!
I know that. I used to be a guy.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.312
- And what's wrong with sex?
- Well, I haven't... It's...

21:57.382 --> 22:02.445
I haven't exactly...
Ever since I... I haven't...

22:02.521 --> 22:04.751
Taken the new car out
for a test drive?

22:04.823 --> 22:08.520
- That's one way to put it.
- Alexis, what are you waiting for?

22:08.593 --> 22:13.326
Sooner or later someone's gonna
have to put the key in the ignition.

22:24.309 --> 22:27.176
Alexis, I am being blackmailed
by the girl's mother.

22:27.245 --> 22:29.975
Either we put Petra on the cover
or they go to the police.

22:30.048 --> 22:34.007
My total lack of surprise:
Is it real or is it Botox?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.611
- I need your help, Alexis.
- [Laughs]

22:36.688 --> 22:38.679
- This is not funny.
- Yeah, it is.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.123
Because you're
the one our father trusts.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.253
This morning he offered me
ten million dollars to resign

22:44.329 --> 22:48.129
<i>- and leave you in charge of Mode.
- Look, I didn't know that.</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:50.395
But you can't hold this against me.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.996
Sorry, Danny, but you just became
a little pawn in this game.

22:54.072 --> 22:58.634
Want Miss Teen Kazakhstan on the cover?
You're gonna be the one to resign.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.043
So, what, you'd screw me over
just to piss off Dad?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.240
Yep.

23:04.249 --> 23:06.581
You have a cold heart, Alexis.

23:06.651 --> 23:09.643
I had it installed
with the other upgrades.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.088
Here you go, Santos.

23:17.529 --> 23:18.587
Have a bite.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.160
You first.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.464
What are you being so suspicious for?

23:24.536 --> 23:27.232
Can't a man have a meal
with his daughter's...?

23:27.305 --> 23:29.273
What exactly are you two?

23:29.341 --> 23:33.334
We're dating.
Is that why you called me over?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.346
I want to have a little chat.

23:36.648 --> 23:40.914
Let me take you back in time: 1995.
Remember that year?

23:40.986 --> 23:45.116
Yeah, sure. Knicks lost in the
playoffs. Braves won the Series.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.215
<i>Sunset Boulevard
won the Tony for Musical.</i>

23:48.627 --> 23:52.563
Yeah. Justin made me
a Broadway-A-Day Calendar.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.691
Also the year my daughter spent
a month crying in her bedroom

23:55.767 --> 23:59.259
because she was pregnant
and you walked out on her.

23:59.337 --> 24:01.567
Look, man, are we gonna do this again?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.698
Hmm?

24:02.774 --> 24:06.369
- 12 years and I gotta prove...?
- Don't have to prove anything to me.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.107
I don't care enough about you.
But for some reason,

24:09.181 --> 24:11.581
my daughter and my grandson do.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.882
Look, you walked away once. We both
know you're gonna walk away again.

24:15.954 --> 24:20.050
So do it now, before anyone
starts dreaming about a future

24:20.125 --> 24:21.956
that's never going to happen.

24:37.576 --> 24:38.702
[Knocking]

24:38.777 --> 24:40.836
My assistant said you
were looking for me.

24:40.912 --> 24:45.645
Yes. Um... I've been thinking
about your offer for dinner tonight,

24:45.717 --> 24:51.053
- and now I'm thinking "yes."
- Excellent.

24:52.557 --> 24:56.425
But there's something
we should talk about first.

24:56.495 --> 25:00.625
I don't know how this is possible,
but I guess you don't know...

25:00.699 --> 25:04.430
- That you used to be a man?
- That made it to Brazil?

25:04.503 --> 25:08.405
You are international, Alexis Meade.
Like the House of Pancakes.

25:10.742 --> 25:15.372
It's nice to see you laugh.
You have so much sadness in your eyes.

25:18.950 --> 25:23.512
I don't care about who you were.
I want to know who you are now.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.022
See you around eight.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.595
Christina?

25:42.807 --> 25:45.139
Hello?

25:52.150 --> 25:56.883
<i>[Betty] Christina. We must talk.</i>

25:58.123 --> 25:59.852
<i>OK, that's too scary.</i>

26:00.825 --> 26:03.055
<i>[Sighs] What do I say?</i>

26:04.729 --> 26:06.890
<i>God, I want an ice cream sundae.</i>

26:06.965 --> 26:09.729
<i>Chocolate sauce? No, hot fudge.</i>

26:09.801 --> 26:13.396
<i>Nuts? No nuts?
Yeah, go for the nuts, why not?</i>

26:13.471 --> 26:15.166
<i>OK. Focus.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:16.298
<i>Um...</i>

26:17.008 --> 26:21.035
<i>Christina, can we please talk?</i>

26:37.228 --> 26:40.959
- Betty.
- Henry. Hi.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.466
I put your paycheck in your desk.
Feeling better?

26:43.535 --> 26:47.528
- I didn't think you'd be back.
- I kind of felt I had to.

26:47.606 --> 26:52.441
- So you heard about Daniel?
- What? No. What do you mean?

26:56.181 --> 27:00.140
- Betty, what are you doing?
- You and me have a lot to talk about.

27:00.218 --> 27:04.712
But first, us. I shouldn't have
shut you out. That was wrong of me.

27:04.789 --> 27:08.088
But you were more wrong.
You really hurt me at that club.

27:08.159 --> 27:12.619
I know. I am sorry. I messed up.

27:12.697 --> 27:15.097
I didn't mean those things I said.

27:15.166 --> 27:19.330
Good. Because when you hired me,
you got more than an assistant.

27:19.404 --> 27:22.237
You got a friend.
