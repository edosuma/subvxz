00:08.258 --> 00:10.844
-[bell tolling]
-[dog barking in distance]

00:10.927 --> 00:12.762
[car horn honks]

00:15.765 --> 00:17.517
[engine starts]

02:14.092 --> 02:17.846
[man]  His given name is Benjamin
Barnwright, but everybody calls him Benji.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.223
Came back to town,
just like I told you he would.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.725
Benji was home watching TV
the night Beverly Jean was killed?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.936
That's what he told us and I believe him.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.106
He let us search his car, no warrant.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.234
And we didn't find a thing
except for some of Beverly Jean's hair,

02:31.317 --> 02:33.570
but in the passenger seat,
like you'd expect it.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.198
Passenger seat's not the best way
to transport a corpse, I'll give you that.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.201
But you said he was home alone
watching TV?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.871
-That's not much of an alibi.
-Why?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.124
Isn't that what most people do
most nights of the week?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.167
Benjamin is definitely most people.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.044
He's worked the same job
ever since high school,

02:50.128 --> 02:51.546
bagging groceries at the A&P.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.008
Works at the A&P? Does he have access
to a delivery vehicle?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.926
Nope. Only works the floor.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.700
Is he expecting us?

03:21.659 --> 03:24.120
He's in mourning,
I thought it'd be polite to let him know.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.622
We should've brought a six pack.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.298
[thunder rumbles]

03:35.381 --> 03:37.008
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Sure.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.801
-It's instant.
-None for me, thanks.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.221
I'll wait.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.641
Uh...

03:44.724 --> 03:48.102
I got some donuts, too.
Half glazed, half cake.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.565
I'd love a donut. Thanks, Benjamin.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.818
Thanks for meeting with us,
Mr. Barnwright.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.861
Benjamin.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.614
I'm Bill Tench, this is Holden Ford.
We're with the FBI.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.783
He told me you'll be helping
with the case.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.660
We're sorry about your girlfriend.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.911
[tearful] I still can't believe it.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.664
-[Holden] How long were you with her?
-Eighteen months.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.707
So this was pretty serious.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.668
We just got engaged.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.752
[Tench] Big step.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.423
-I knew she was it when I met her.
-How'd you know?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.760
Uh, we saw things the same way.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.346
-[Holden] And you're how old?
-Twenty-six.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.225
You play sports in high school?
I'm guessing not the football team.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.978
-Band? Debate?
-No.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.729
Then what did you do?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.650
Uh, I... nothing.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.739
Well, you're doing good now.
Got your own place and everything.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.617
Got this place for Beverly Jean.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.035
[Holden] She ask you to move?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.914
I wanted us to have some privacy.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.708
Where were you before?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.127
A few blocks over on Chestnut.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.337
-With your family?
-Uh, with my mom.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.299
It must have been hard on her,
seeing you leave home.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.468
I think she was happy to see me move on.

05:03.886 --> 05:07.181
She loved Beverly Jean as much as I did.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.643
Mrs. Barnwright goes to my church, too.
First United Methodist.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.146
So you two know each other from church?

05:13.229 --> 05:15.023
Yeah. You and Rose.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.860
Mostly by sight now.
I don't go much anymore.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.613
Was your mother a disciplinarian?

05:22.697 --> 05:24.240
You mean strict?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.076
[Holden] Yeah. She crack the whip?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.828
Uh...

05:28.911 --> 05:30.288
She just cried.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.583
Well, I'm sure it was difficult
raising two kids without a dad.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.251
Yeah, he split when I was ten.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.880
-What was your father like?
-I don't much remember him.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.466
You and Beverly Jean ever fight?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.677
Perfectly normal for a young couple.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.056
Sometimes.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.849
[Tench] What'd you fight about?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.060
Just stupid stuff.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.811
Like what?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.104
Like, uh...

05:56.189 --> 05:57.607
what movie to go to.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.985
-[Tench] Any nerves around the engagement?
-No, sir.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.572
You got this place for her?
Did she like it?

06:06.699 --> 06:07.784
She, uh...

06:09.744 --> 06:13.247
She wanted to make it pretty
when she moved in.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.540
[Tench] When was that gonna be?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.375
-After the wedding.
-Traditional, huh?

06:16.959 --> 06:19.378
-Yeah.
-[Holden] Was that for your mother?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.714
That was just to keep it proper.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.217
Was she saving herself for marriage?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.097
Well, maybe she didn't want to wait.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.517
Girls like fooling around
just as much as boys.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.895
That's okay, Benjamin.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.146
We understand, that's...

06:38.064 --> 06:39.440
That's private.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.775
We'll keep it private.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.237
[Benjamin] Uh, well...

06:45.863 --> 06:48.074
Beverly Jean was, uh, my...

06:49.700 --> 06:50.868
first, uh...

06:51.452 --> 06:53.788
Your first sexual experience?

06:53.871 --> 06:54.997
Yeah.

06:56.707 --> 06:57.875
But she was nice.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.172
I don't know what all this has to do
with what happened to her--

07:03.256 --> 07:06.384
Listen, Benjamin.
We're from a particular unit of the FBI.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.303
We investigate murders
when there's a sexual angle.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.931
It may be unpleasant, but it's what we do.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.854
[sobbing]

07:17.937 --> 07:19.605
It's awful, what was done to her.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.275
Does he know?

07:23.901 --> 07:25.361
Mark, seriously?

07:27.488 --> 07:30.616
He only knows about the breasts.
It was another officer--

07:32.285 --> 07:35.121
-It's hard keeping this quiet.
-I want to talk to Mrs. Barnwright.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.540
Should we stop at a pay phone,
give her a heads up, too?

07:37.623 --> 07:39.584
-That'd be fair.
-[Holden] What about the tears?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.294
-I didn't buy them.
-Think he was faking?

07:41.377 --> 07:43.629
-[Tench] Seemed a bit much.
-[Mark] Given what he's been through?

07:43.713 --> 07:46.632
-It sure got us out of there.
-He's obviously a mama's boy.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.301
Or he knows how to play one.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.636
What do you mean?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.222
He was a virgin? He serves donuts?

07:53.723 --> 07:57.643
All of that could have been rehearsed,
especially since he knew we were coming.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.231
Benjamin has never seemed
like a performer to me.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.526
Two Feds in your living room
would make anybody nervous.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.279
Look at him, you think
he could have easily moved a body?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.198
Not without bursting into tears.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.199
[laughs]

08:15.786 --> 08:17.872
[woman]  I always worried about Benjamin.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.625
[Tench]  He was living with you
when he met Beverly Jean?

08:20.708 --> 08:25.254
-He was so excited to have a girlfriend.
-Did she reciprocate those feelings?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.090
He said that she was crazy about him.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.343
-Did you meet her?
-Of course.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.762
What were they like together?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.181
Well, they were... normal.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.644
She teased him a lot. He pretended
not to enjoy it, but I know he did.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.356
Benjamin told us
the two of them argued sometimes.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.359
Did you see him?

08:47.652 --> 08:48.736
This morning.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.281
Is he in trouble?

08:53.574 --> 08:57.453
We're just going over the case again,
talking to everyone who knew Beverly Jean.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.874
Well... I never heard them argue.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.170
Benjamin is soft, you know.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.713
What was he like as a kid?

09:07.797 --> 09:12.009
He was always sensitive.
But when his father ran off, he just...

09:15.012 --> 09:16.097
[Holden] What do you mean?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.016
Well...

09:19.725 --> 09:21.852
he started to cry a lot, wet the bed.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.564
-He wouldn't leave the house.
-[Holden] That must have been difficult.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.316
I had to leave the kids
on their own a lot.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.070
Rose helped out,
but she was just so little.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.659
Those were hard years.
I did a lot of praying.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.747
But then Rose met Frank
and he moved in with us.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.583
Frank Janderman.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.251
[woman] That's right.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.378
They just had a baby, you know.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.838
Your first grandchild?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.923
Congratulations.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.762
People talked about Frank back then,
but I never listened to all that.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.682
I loved him from the first time I met him.
I still do.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.475
Did Benjamin feel the same way?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.979
Well, he started to go out, you know.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.939
He became friends with Frank.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.941
Frank protected him.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.028
He wouldn't let anyone near Rose.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.949
He even got Benji a job
so I didn't have to work two shifts.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.579
Sometimes Rose said
I loved him more than she did.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.124
When was this?

10:27.126 --> 10:29.420
Well, uh... they got married at 18,

10:29.503 --> 10:32.048
so Rose must have been...

10:34.508 --> 10:36.010
15, 16 at the time.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.888
Frank moved in. Why?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.058
Well, I don't remember.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.812
He had some problems at home
with his father, as young boys do.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.441
But he got them their own place
when they married.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.319
And Benjamin lived at home with you
until he met Beverly Jean?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.074
It's been a strange time.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.744
We were so happy that Rose and Frank
were having a baby,

11:01.827 --> 11:06.874
and then Benjamin loses his love
in such a horrible way. [sobs]

11:13.005 --> 11:14.507
Like mother, like son.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.926
You think there's a gene for crying?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.596
I keep wondering why Beverly was
with him in the first place.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.433
She might have liked that he was older,
easy to talk to. He's sensitive.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.685
"Half glazed, half cake"?

11:27.061 --> 11:27.978
Sure.

11:29.146 --> 11:33.192
I bet Beverly had poor old pipsqueak Benji
wrapped around her golden triangle.

11:33.692 --> 11:37.154
Maybe she wanted a nice guy
with a steady income who loved her.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.031
Whatever you say, Ocasek.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.783
What's that?

11:41.242 --> 11:43.077
We were just saying there's not much here.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.871
I assured Mrs. Barnwright
this was a formality.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.833
-It's not a formality.
-Well, I can tell her it is.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.960
So where does this leave us?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.337
There's still Alvin.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.465
You don't want it to be someone
in the community. Neither of you do.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.802
Who drives all this way
to come to some rust belt town?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.388
If you're hunting for girls,
you got big cities.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.598
You got freeways with hitchhikers.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.058
Why choose a place like this?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.145
How would a drifter
know where the dump is?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.988
-Hi.
-There you are.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.740
I got all kinds of fun things
for you to look over.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.741
Ooh. Paperwork?

12:22.825 --> 12:26.203
Yeah, it's hardly sexy, but I'm trying
to put together a list of questions

12:26.287 --> 12:27.455
for the killers that you interview.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.124
Things like family history, mood,

12:30.207 --> 12:32.418
thought patterns before, during,
and after the crime.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.255
This is just a first draft, but look it
over and let me know what you think.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.924
Shouldn't we tailor the interviews
based on the killer's personality?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.092
You mean just wing it?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.720
With these guys,
we need to look for different ways in.

12:42.803 --> 12:46.515
Yes, but we still need a data set
that's consistent across all our subjects.

12:48.017 --> 12:48.851
You leaving?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.478
-Back to Boston.
-You just got here.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.106
Well, until you conduct more interviews,
there's really nothing for me to do here.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.526
We had a really interesting conversation
with the fiancé of that victim in Altoona.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.947
-I got a taxi waiting.
-Cancel it. I'll drive you.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.456
-Let me take your bag.
-Thank you.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.793
He lost it. I've never seen a guy
cry like that.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.129
Bill was skeptical.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.881
-But you believed him?
-It looked real.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.009
Well, how did it feel?
I mean, were you moved?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.345
-Did you want to comfort him?
-I wanted him to stop.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.013
Why'd you want him to stop?

13:26.096 --> 13:27.890
I don't know, maybe I'm just callous.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.601
Try a little harder, Holden.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.731
It felt wrong.

13:36.565 --> 13:40.819
Benjamin was blubbering like a baby,
but it didn't seem vulnerable.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.030
It felt hostile.

13:43.656 --> 13:48.035
You know, psychopaths are extremely
skilled at imitating human emotions.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.828
It's how they manipulate other people

13:49.912 --> 13:52.289
or how they gain power
over their environment.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.708
How do they understand emotions
if they don't have them?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.670
Well, they have emotions. They just
don't believe other people have them.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.465
Or more specifically, they don't believe
that other people have interior lives.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.925
How do we sniff them out?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.427
Well, it seems like you just did.
Trust your instincts.

14:05.511 --> 14:10.182
The whole town sees Benjamin as this lost
little puppy that needs protecting.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.226
Maybe my instincts are wrong.

14:12.309 --> 14:16.397
Well, we're developing a methodology,
so use it.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.693
Look at where the perpetrator went.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.071
Hair, breasts, vagina,
all symbols of her sexual power.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.449
Disfiguring her reproductive organs
was a way to neutralize her.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.494
What about the hair on the ironing board?
Was that some kind of display?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.746
Like a trophy.
A way to assert his dominance.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.417
Benjamin is anything but assertive.
Beverly's the first woman he slept with.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.002
-How old is he?
-Twenty-six.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.713
So that would give the relationship
an extra significance.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.756
Bill thinks the only reason
she was with him

14:42.840 --> 14:45.217
is because she has total
sexual control over him.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.678
Well, what's her history?
Was she a virgin, too?

14:47.761 --> 14:48.929
He was touchy about that.

14:49.013 --> 14:53.183
So then she had some experience,
which could either excite or threaten him.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.811
In the photo,
she looks like the girl next door.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.315
You really believe that a young,
pretty girl can't be manipulative?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.192
[Carr]  Even if she
was using sex to control him,

15:02.276 --> 15:04.069
and you have absolutely no evidence
for this,

15:04.153 --> 15:07.823
then it would be what many women do
to have an ounce of power in this world.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.700
Fine, but if it went too far,

15:09.783 --> 15:12.328
if something happened
and Benjamin snapped,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.663
could feelings of impotence
explain his rage?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.125
Could it explain him going back four days
later to cut her up like you said,

15:18.208 --> 15:20.669
-as an attempt to assert control?
-Possibly.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.172
But then wouldn't the rape
already have accomplished that?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.174
-Accomplish control?
-Exactly.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.177
In all the crimes we've studied,
there's never been an example

15:28.260 --> 15:30.512
of a victim being raped
then depersonalized.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.514
If the killer mutilates her after death,

15:32.598 --> 15:34.850
then he usually commits sexual acts
after death as well.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.645
To make up for his sense of inadequacy
while she was still alive.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.522
It's like there's two different
presentations in this crime scene.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.816
[indistinct PA announcement]

15:44.151 --> 15:45.986
Anybody picking you up in Boston?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.614
I'll grab a cab. Bye.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.409
[rock music plays]

15:55.204 --> 15:57.623
[doorbell rings]

15:57.706 --> 15:59.959
-Hey.
-Hey. What are you...

16:03.629 --> 16:05.214
-Up to?
-Studying.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.049
Pulling an all-nighter.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.386
Writing a paper on C. Wright Mills
and the power elite.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.097
Due tomorrow.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.266
It's about the people
who really run this country.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.144
Hardly what our democracy
is supposed to be about.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.147
-Are you okay?
-What?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.857
-You seem--
-Oh. My friend gave me diet pills.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.568
-Really?
-Speed actually makes this interesting.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.656
May I see those?

16:32.950 --> 16:35.494
Great for concentration,
keeps you totally focused.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.747
-Beer? Coffee? Tea?
-Is this legal?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.083
Uh-oh. Out comes the narc.

16:44.878 --> 16:49.633
We were digging into his relationship
with the fiancé and he burst into tears.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.301
Bill thought he was bullshitting,

16:51.385 --> 16:55.139
but psychopaths are extremely skilled
at imitating human emotions.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.890
I once went crying to my professor.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.768
You fake cried?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.938
Made up an elaborate story about my dad
in some horrendous accident.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.898
-When was this?
-My freshman year.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.776
I was partying a little too much,
almost flunked out of school.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.862
The interesting thing was,

17:09.945 --> 17:12.197
while I was lying,
I actually started believing it.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.950
Made for a good show.
He raised my grade to a C.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.201
-Your teacher was male.
-So?

17:16.285 --> 17:19.955
Women crying to men always works.
Men to men? [scoffs]

17:20.039 --> 17:22.708
-Not my point.
-Why were you drinking so much?

17:24.251 --> 17:28.213
I wanted to fit in.
I wanted to be wild and crazy.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.591
-Why?
-I was tired of always thinking.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.677
-Don't you get tired of thinking?
-No.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.056
And it made it easier
to sleep with people.

17:42.102 --> 17:45.397
-How many people did you sleep with?
-[sighs] Let's not.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.192
-A lot?
-What difference does that make?

17:48.275 --> 17:50.736
-Just curious.
-And judgmental.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.489
Five...

17:54.948 --> 17:56.909
-Ten...
-This is getting tedious.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.290
-Ten?
-Holden... I'm not doing this.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.336
[whispers] Ten.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.296
[distant gunfire]

18:09.379 --> 18:10.214
[Tench]  Uh-huh.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.761
-Jesus.
-[man]  I know. What do we do?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.471
-Hell, pick him up.
-What do I tell him?

18:17.554 --> 18:21.266
Don't tell him anything. Let him stew
for a few hours until we get there.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.184
Okay.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.604
Ocasek looked into Frank Janderman.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.191
Apparently, in high school,
he was sent to a psychiatric hospital

18:29.274 --> 18:31.026
for taking a monkey wrench to a girl.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.238
-Frank Janderman?
-Rose's husband.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.951
We should get this on tape.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.290
So I got to thinking,
why did Mrs. Barnwright

18:45.374 --> 18:47.459
say people were talking
about Frank back then?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.795
-What were they talking about, right?
-Right.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.464
So I talked to this family court judge
who's a friend of mine.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.341
Sure enough, he remembers the case.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.218
Since Frank was a juvenile
when the assault occurred,

18:56.301 --> 18:57.261
the court sealed the records.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.472
Fortunately, the judge
is a very good friend of mine.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.850
Here's what we've got on Frank's hearing,

19:04.393 --> 19:05.686
and his time at Warren State.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.062
Nice work, Mark.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.274
This is where your community system
pays off.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.317
He's been here since nine.
Maybe we should--

19:12.401 --> 19:13.402
Let him wait.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.738
Why don't we have a cup of coffee?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.992
If Frank's a hothead,
it'll irritate him, throw him off.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.996
Class of '71?

19:24.079 --> 19:26.415
-Yep.
-You go to your five-year reunion?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.543
I don't really keep up with that stuff.

19:30.043 --> 19:33.088
It's commendable that you graduated,
seeing as how you missed your junior year.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.549
What do you want from me?
I've been here all day.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.677
-I answered all your questions last week.
-We just have a few more.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.014
You've got everyone in a tizzy.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.224
-You mean Benjamin?
-Yeah.

19:44.308 --> 19:48.896
The whole family. Me, my wife, mom.
You scared the shit out of Benji.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.607
[sighs] I'm sorry if we scared everyone.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.609
And for keeping you for so long.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.903
Beverly Jean Shaw was close
with your family.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.613
We're simply looking
for a little background.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.697
She wasn't that close.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.491
She was about to marry
your brother-in-law.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.701
They hadn't set a date.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.997
-I didn't spend a lot of time with him.
-You and Benjamin aren't close?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.999
What's this "close" shit?
That's like women.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.461
Mrs. Barnwright said
you looked out for him.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.465
-Well, yeah, he's a shrimp.
-And he's your brother-in-law.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.175
Yep.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.053
-So you would help him if he needed it.
-Yep.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.933
Did you fight a lot in high school?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.351
Like Popeye.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.315
How'd you land yourself
in Warren State Psychiatric Hospital?

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
It's probably in your fucking file.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.072
We want to hear your side.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.492
[exhales]

20:43.992 --> 20:46.495
This girl freaked out on me,
came after me with a wrench.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.206
I tried to get it,
it swang back, hit her in the face.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.416
Then all this shit
came raining down on me.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.794
Why'd she freak out?

20:53.877 --> 20:57.130
-I was seeing some other girl, too.
-You a ladies man?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.924
Maybe. Back then.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.511
-They sent you to a mental institution.
-That was bullshit.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.222
-I had to go, it was part of the plea.
-You did a plea deal?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.307
Why not go to court,
tell them what you told us?

21:07.391 --> 21:10.686
My lawyer said I'd never win
against a sweet girl with a broken nose.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.148
There were other infractions, I was
running around like a jackass back then.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.610
-But no longer?
-I'm married now. Got a kid.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.863
Marriage and fatherhood
don't make anger go away.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.283
I wasn't angry, I was just...

21:24.366 --> 21:25.951
Misunderstood?

21:26.785 --> 21:29.454
Makes me sound like a pussy, but yeah.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.250
Want to tell us about the night
Beverly Jean disappeared?

21:34.042 --> 21:35.294
[sighs heavily]

21:35.377 --> 21:39.464
I don't know. It was, uh...
typical, I guess.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.425
Rose was still pregnant back then.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.011
Got her some dinner and watched TV.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.221
-So you were home all night.
-No.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.597
No?

21:48.265 --> 21:51.059
No. I told you,
I went out and got us dinner.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.728
How long were you gone?

21:53.061 --> 21:55.772
I don't know, 15, 20 minutes maybe.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.566
Where'd you get food?

21:57.649 --> 21:59.943
Rose likes the rolls at Hannah's Diner
on Market Street.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.570
And Rose will confirm this?

22:02.904 --> 22:05.574
Am I under some kind of suspicion here?

22:05.657 --> 22:08.994
We're just looking at it from every angle.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.290
No, Beverly Jean was, uh...
was Benji's girl.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.750
I barely knew her.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.836
Strange, seeing as how she was
about to be part of the family.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.129
[exhales]

22:19.212 --> 22:21.048
Stop saying it like that.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.425
You said they hadn't set a date
for the wedding.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.387
-It was loose.
-They were engaged, weren't they?

22:27.471 --> 22:28.764
[sighs]

22:28.847 --> 22:30.307
Benji thought they were.

22:32.726 --> 22:37.189
The impression I got is that she was
in love with him, wanted to marry him.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.192
Oh, man, I don't want to rain
on his parade--

22:40.275 --> 22:42.569
You're saying he made the relationship
more than what it was?

22:42.652 --> 22:44.738
She let him call her his girlfriend.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.198
He got that apartment for her.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.617
Yeah, that was the big plan,
get her to move in.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.745
-Was Beverly even sleeping with him?
-Now and again.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.581
A looker like her, he thought he'd died
and gone to heaven.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.793
-You found her attractive?
-She's a seven.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.337
Really? From the photos,
I'd give her an eight.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.755
In Altoona, she's a solid eight.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.801
I thought Benji had done
pretty good for himself.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.303
Especially for a guy who's...

23:09.513 --> 23:10.806
so quick to cry.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.390
Shit, yeah.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.519
Do you think that he was satisfying her?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.022
[exhales]

23:19.773 --> 23:22.651
-I don't think he was blowing her mind.
-She tell you that?

23:22.734 --> 23:25.821
Not in so many words, but when a chick's
enjoying it, she's all over you.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.614
You think Beverly Jean
knew the difference?

23:28.448 --> 23:31.618
You think she'd, you know...
been around?

23:32.994 --> 23:36.331
I'd say she was, uh... open.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.919
[Holden] Benjamin see it that way too?

23:41.503 --> 23:44.172
I don't know if he didn't get it
or he didn't want to.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.726
Everyone we interviewed
said Beverly Jean was...

23:56.810 --> 24:00.313
nice, loyal, decent.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.356
Well...

24:03.441 --> 24:06.236
no one's gonna come right out
and say the dead girl was easy.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.364
Frank's cagey. You hear him deflect
on that deal in high school?

24:10.198 --> 24:12.075
He could have made that up
about her being a slut.

24:12.159 --> 24:12.993
What if he didn't?

24:13.535 --> 24:16.329
Listen, if Beverly had the upper hand
in the relationship

24:16.413 --> 24:19.166
and made Benjamin feel jealous
by seeing other men,

24:20.167 --> 24:23.044
if Benjamin felt sexually powerless,

24:23.128 --> 24:25.881
he might lash out with the kind of anger
we see in this crime.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.592
Let's see what Benjamin has to say.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.385
-Bring him in?
-Yeah.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.679
You understand you're not under arrest?

24:32.762 --> 24:35.932
You're free to leave at any point,
only have to talk to us if you want to.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.560
And you're okay with us
recording this conversation?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.604
It's just so much easier
than writing everything down.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.731
Yeah. I want to help if I can.

24:43.857 --> 24:47.068
You know a lot about this case
you're not telling us, don't you?

24:47.485 --> 24:50.655
Uh, no,
nothing more than what I already said.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.656
We talked to Frank.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.618
He paints a different picture
of your relationship with Beverly.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.621
He said you made up that part
about you and her being engaged.

24:58.496 --> 24:59.873
Uh...

24:59.956 --> 25:01.708
Well, I didn't have a ring yet,

25:01.791 --> 25:05.545
but, um, but I asked her and she said yes.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.964
It sounded like she wanted
to keep her options open.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.344
[Tench] Benjamin?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.723
Did Frank say that?

25:16.806 --> 25:18.225
[Tench] He said a lot of things.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.437
-'Cause he was jealous.
-[Holden] Jealous?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.064
Why would he be jealous?

25:24.147 --> 25:26.066
He's married. To your sister.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.025
Well...

25:28.860 --> 25:32.072
He was always asking when...
she was coming around,

25:32.155 --> 25:35.200
always talking to her
like she was his girlfriend.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.702
-What do you mean?
-Like "Hey, hon,"

25:37.786 --> 25:41.706
"Hey, babe,"
"Hey, sweetheart, go get me a beer."

25:42.540 --> 25:43.375
And...

25:45.210 --> 25:47.295
he was always getting her
to sit on his lap.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.549
-Did she want to sit on his lap?
-She had to or it would've been rude.

25:51.633 --> 25:55.136
-Did he try to have sex with her?
-No, it didn't go that far.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.972
[Holden] He told us he was interested.

25:57.055 --> 26:00.141
Beverly Jean was a beautiful woman.
She wouldn't do that.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.270
-Do what, have sex? She had sex with you.
-She loved me.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.939
But she wasn't exactly
saving herself for marriage.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.024
[Benjamin sobbing]

26:08.608 --> 26:10.443
Do you think you satisfied her, Benjamin?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.946
[bell rings]

26:24.708 --> 26:26.626
Did you see her that night
when she got off work?

26:26.710 --> 26:29.087
No. I was home, I was watching television.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.464
Didn't you want her to come over,
hang out with you?

26:31.548 --> 26:34.926
Of course I wanted her to come over,
because I loved her.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.053
[sobbing] Now she's dead.

26:38.346 --> 26:41.016
Oh, my God!

26:41.599 --> 26:43.476
Oh, my God!

26:45.312 --> 26:48.648
-[soft music plays]
-[indistinct chatter]

26:53.737 --> 26:55.447
So did Beverly Jean sleep around?

26:58.074 --> 27:00.994
-Alvin tried to pick her up at a bar.
-She turned him down.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.537
[Holden] What was she doing at a bar?

27:02.954 --> 27:05.915
-Having a drink?
-Was she alone, with a girlfriend?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.334
What would that tell us?

27:07.417 --> 27:09.169
A single woman in a bar...

27:09.252 --> 27:11.463
A single woman might go alone
just to have a drink.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.132
What about her?
Is she trying to pick someone up?

27:14.799 --> 27:17.344
-Well, probably.
-Why, because she's by herself?

27:17.802 --> 27:19.054
Because she's at a bar?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.598
-Yeah.
-That's an assumption.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.851
Say she is looking for someone,
does that make her easy?

27:24.934 --> 27:26.811
Is she looking for a husband
or a one-night stand?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.688
Does the difference
change your perception?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.106
-Sure.
-Why?

27:30.190 --> 27:34.778
Well, changes whether
I'd be interested in her, theoretically.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.906
What if you're looking
for a one-night stand... theoretically?

27:37.989 --> 27:40.408
No, I don't-- It's not my thing.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.993
-Come on, Mark.
-[Tench] Leave him alone.

27:42.077 --> 27:46.164
Beverly's sexual history is only important
because if she was seeing other men,

27:46.247 --> 27:47.874
then obviously they're suspects.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.459
So who else can we talk to?

27:52.545 --> 27:56.257
There's a couple of friends
we could question... again.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.176
Anyone else she might have confided in?

27:58.885 --> 28:01.679
She did just get her hair done. Right?

28:03.973 --> 28:05.183
Here's a question,

28:05.266 --> 28:07.685
if it is Benjamin or some other boyfriend
who freaked out on her,

28:07.769 --> 28:09.771
does the case merit our involvement?

28:11.147 --> 28:14.651
We still can't rule out a sequence killer,
but if the perpetrator was a townie,

28:14.734 --> 28:17.654
then the crime is random, and there's
no expectation that he'll be repeating it.

28:17.737 --> 28:21.032
Here's my question, shouldn't our funding
cover separate rooms?

28:21.116 --> 28:22.534
You don't like my company?

28:23.159 --> 28:24.536
We'll get connecting doors.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.890
The mutilation of her body alone
justifies our involvement.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.020
Would you mind sitting
on your own bed, please?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.591
Well, that was a dead end.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.217
Who's next?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.803
One of the families she baby-sat for,
the Snyders.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.433
You mind if we take a quick detour?
Something's been bugging me.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.476
[Tench] Okay.

29:52.665 --> 29:53.625
Hi, Rose.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.339
I just got him to sleep.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.174
Pretty hard having a newborn.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.218
All anybody ever tells you
is how great it is.

30:03.301 --> 30:07.138
But my wife and I, with both our kids,
we walked around like zombies

30:07.222 --> 30:08.640
for the first three months.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.644
You know, Trinity Lutheran,
over on Sycamore,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.437
has a program for single moms.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.731
Not that you're single,
but it's your first child

30:16.815 --> 30:20.068
and they'll have all kinds of information
on feeding him, getting him to sleep.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.153
-Thanks.
-What about Frank?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.531
-He help you out?
-[Rose] When he can.

30:25.031 --> 30:25.949
He's got work.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.618
Your mom certainly seems excited
about having a grandbaby.

30:28.701 --> 30:29.911
[Rose] She is happy.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.372
And Benjamin, is he helping?

30:33.248 --> 30:36.209
-[scoffs] No.
-You close with Benjamin?

30:36.793 --> 30:38.044
He's my older brother.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.088
[Tench] By how much?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.215
Fourteen months.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.008
You have good memories growing up?

30:44.551 --> 30:46.886
Mom went to work. Got two jobs.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.597
Two kids, two jobs. How'd she swing that?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.474
Me and Benji went to school
a couple blocks over.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.309
We would walk home in the afternoon.

30:53.393 --> 30:56.437
-And you were how old?
-Ten. Maybe eleven.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.564
That's pretty young.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.484
Mom would come home tired,
wasn't really up for dealing with kids.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.446
-I'd make sure the house was clean.
-It's no small feat.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.910
-How old were you when you met Frank?
-Sixteen.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.997
You know about the incident with Frank
in high school?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.376
It was before I met him.

31:19.294 --> 31:23.047
-[Tench] You ever talk with him about it?
-[Rose] He told me it was some accident.

31:24.924 --> 31:25.925
Rose...

31:27.093 --> 31:28.469
you knew Beverly Jean.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.389
What was she like?

31:31.848 --> 31:33.349
She was really sweet.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.102
[Holden] You think she
was good for Benjamin?

31:36.185 --> 31:37.896
She made him want to leave home.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.189
I thought that was good.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.278
We gave him money for a security deposit.
Signed his lease.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.905
Did she intend to marry him?

31:49.032 --> 31:50.283
He was working on her.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.536
Was she... seeing other men?

31:56.706 --> 31:59.042
Benjamin thought she might be.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.293
Benjamin told you this?

32:03.129 --> 32:06.174
He said he thought
she was giving him the runaround.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.218
Getting done up for other guys.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.054
Done up how?

32:11.137 --> 32:12.764
Dressing provocatively?

32:13.389 --> 32:15.600
Painting her nails? Wearing perfume?

32:15.683 --> 32:16.726
Getting her hair done.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.189
[Tench] Frank told us he was with you
the night Beverly Jean was murdered.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.232
-Is that true?
-Yes.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.402
Well, uh...

32:28.738 --> 32:30.823
he went out to get us food.

32:30.907 --> 32:34.661
-How long was he gone?
-[baby cries]

32:49.842 --> 32:53.096
[baby cooing]

32:54.931 --> 32:56.975
Rose, if you are hiding something

32:57.725 --> 33:00.812
and they find out about it,
it will not be good for you...

33:01.980 --> 33:03.022
or for him.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.026
[baby cries]

33:24.544 --> 33:25.753
What are we missing?

33:29.590 --> 33:31.718
-Did you see those bruises on her arm?
-[Tench] Yeah.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.302
You think Frank did that?

33:33.386 --> 33:36.639
Her mother told us that he wouldn't let
anyone else get close to her.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.600
Should we search Frank's car?

33:40.476 --> 33:42.270
-I would need a warrant.
-[Tench] Let's get one.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.109
Mark. There's a young woman downstairs
asking for you.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.621
Hi, Rose.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.837
[stammers] Do--
[clears throat]

34:10.590 --> 34:14.093
[whispers] Do you promise my baby will
be okay if I tell you what happened?

34:15.136 --> 34:16.054
Of course.

34:20.975 --> 34:21.934
It's okay.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.813
-It's okay. Hey.
-[sobs]

34:33.946 --> 34:37.909
So you said Frank was not home
the night Beverly Jean disappeared?

34:40.453 --> 34:41.370
Yes.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.414
Do you know where he was?

34:45.750 --> 34:46.709
Yes.

34:48.419 --> 34:49.462
Where was he?

34:50.588 --> 34:53.382
Benji called us that night
and asked Frank to come over.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.428
Okay.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.264
So Frank left.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.183
How long was he gone?

35:06.646 --> 35:09.899
He called after two or three hours.
Asked me to come over there too.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.902
-What time was this?
-Ten or eleven?

35:12.985 --> 35:14.946
But I told him I was tired.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.365
My back hurt. My feet.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.994
I was more than eight months pregnant.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.705
Did he say why
he wanted you to come over?

35:24.789 --> 35:25.790
No.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.835
He just said to come?

35:29.418 --> 35:31.212
He said to bring cleaning supplies.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.926
But... I forgot.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.807
Drove over, let myself in.

35:43.432 --> 35:47.436
Frank was in the living room.
He told me not to get upset.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.688
Was he upset?

35:49.689 --> 35:50.731
He was calm.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.193
Okay. So Frank tells you
not to get upset...

35:56.195 --> 35:58.990
He told me something bad had happened.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.912
My mind started racing, I was worried
something had happened to Benji.

36:07.915 --> 36:10.376
Frank said, "He's fine,
but he's done something."

36:13.171 --> 36:14.589
Benjamin did something?

36:17.800 --> 36:18.759
Yes.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.555
I said, "What's he done?"

36:24.307 --> 36:27.393
He said he got mad at Beverly Jean.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.822
[Rose]  Frank said Benjamin hit her.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.451
I asked if she was okay.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.958
Frank said,
"We got to help Benjamin out of this.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.878
We got to stick together
or he's going to get in trouble."

36:57.965 --> 36:59.634
I asked where Benjamin was.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.303
He said, "He's in the bathroom."

37:03.888 --> 37:06.557
I said, "I want to see him."
He said, "Okay.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.144
But Beverly Jean is in there too."

37:13.064 --> 37:14.357
The door was open.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.276
I saw Benji. He...

37:17.360 --> 37:20.071
He had his head in his hands,
he was crying.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.574
There was blood everywhere.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.243
Splashing.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.580
And then I see Beverly Jean
in the bathtub.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.750
Was she alive?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.003
Dead.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.675
She had her top on, but no panties.

37:43.010 --> 37:45.888
I said, "Benji, what have you done?"

37:47.807 --> 37:49.976
He shook his head.
He didn't want to look at me.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.271
-Was she face up, face down?
-Face up.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.730
Did you notice any wounds?

37:55.523 --> 37:57.775
I couldn't tell, there was a lot of blood.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.527
Then what happened?

37:59.986 --> 38:03.114
Then Frank brought in a tarp,
spread it on the floor.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.325
Then he asked me
to go get cleaning supplies.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.953
When I came back,
they had already rolled her up.

38:09.036 --> 38:12.123
So they took her out to Frank's truck
and drove off.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.460
I washed out the tub
and cleaned up the bathroom.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.423
I scrubbed the tiles, in the cracks,

38:20.506 --> 38:22.300
the grouting, the window frame.

38:23.175 --> 38:26.512
I had to wash all the blood
down the sink and that seemed to...

38:27.263 --> 38:28.514
It took forever...

38:29.473 --> 38:31.350
trying to get it all to go down.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.105
-[Tench] Did you see a weapon?
-There was a knife in the tub.

38:36.188 --> 38:37.481
What'd you do with it?

38:38.858 --> 38:39.984
[Rose]  I rinsed it off.

38:40.067 --> 38:43.154
Took it to the kitchen,
washed it with dish soap.

38:43.612 --> 38:44.822
Put it away.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.994
And then I went home.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.872
[Holden]  Did you see Frank or Benjamin
again that night?

38:52.955 --> 38:53.914
[Rose]  No.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.875
Frank came home early the next morning.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.046
Why did you help them?

39:02.965 --> 39:04.925
It's just what I've always done.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.429
