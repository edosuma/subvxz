WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.642
Open your eyes, Dean.
Let's go take a howl at that moon.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.151
- Heaven needs your help.
- Anything.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.068
Daniel and Adina. They must be found.

00:10.911 --> 00:14.586
They must be brought home and they
must be punished, for the sake of all.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.828
Think of it, the king of hell...

00:17.017 --> 00:20.988
...Dean Winchester by his side.
Together we rule, together we create...

00:21.321 --> 00:23.062
...the perfect hell.

00:23.490 --> 00:27.438
And all of this that's bloomed
between us never ends.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.403
Hey! Don't turn your back on me.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.941
- What do you think you're doing?
- Whatever I want.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.111
You're here for Dean.
I'll give him to you.

00:34.334 --> 00:38.441
Little prat's bad for business.
He's uncontrollable. Must be the mark.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.948
Your pal Crowley sold you out.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.585
We know how to cure demons.

00:42.743 --> 00:46.350
A little Latin, a lot of blood. So,
what are you gonna do? You gonna kill me?

00:46.513 --> 00:48.925
You're my brother,
and I'm here to take you home.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.028
You really think those are gonna work?

00:54.121 --> 00:57.898
- Stop! It's over. it's over.
- Unh!

01:25.085 --> 01:27.588
- Doctor.
- Father.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.376
Really?

02:19.139 --> 02:23.178
For whatever it's worth,
I got your blood type.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.020
Sam, I know you think you're gonna try
and fix me...

02:28.181 --> 02:31.060
...but did it ever occur to you
maybe I don't wanna be fixed?

02:31.218 --> 02:34.688
Just let me go live my
life, I won't bother you.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.525
What do you care?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.727
What do I care?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.836
You think I'm just gonna sit here
like Crowley...

02:49.002 --> 02:51.573
...getting all weepy while you shoot me up?

02:51.805 --> 02:52.909
Well, screw that.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.418
- I don't want this.
- Yeah, I pretty much figured that out.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.715
You don't know if this is gonna work,
do you?

02:58.979 --> 03:02.517
I got a hell of a lot more running
through me than just demon juice.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.060
Mark of Cain. Got it.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.855
That's right.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.890
- Buckle up.
- Sammy...

03:10.323 --> 03:12.769
...you know I hate shots.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.369
I hate demons.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.580
We got a whole bunch more of these to go.
You could make it a lot easier on yourself.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.099
Argh!

04:20.260 --> 04:23.571
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.673
You say you're fine...

04:30.904 --> 04:34.010
...but you don't look fine.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.482
It's what the humans do.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.088
They say they're fine.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.192
And even if I don'! look it,
you say I look well.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.795
That way we avoid talking about something
we can do nothing about.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.825
I'm sorry, I just can't see
how Sam Winchester...

04:51.992 --> 04:56.441
...could ask you to drive all this way to help
with his brother, knowing your condition.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.602
He doesn't know...

05:02.769 --> 05:06.216
...about how badly your borrowed grace
is fading, does he?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.613
He knows some.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.655
And he didn't have to ask.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.822
Sam is alone in this. He's attempting
to change Dean from demon to human...

05:16.983 --> 05:20.226
...with a cure of sanctified blood.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.896
But there's no guarantee that will work.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.666
And if it doesn't, then Dean is gone...

05:26.827 --> 05:29.398
...and the demon must be dealt with.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.007
I just...

05:37.003 --> 05:38.482
I worry about you.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.672
For all you know, you could be killing me.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.038
Or...

06:09.703 --> 06:11.944
...you're just messing with me.

06:12.572 --> 06:16.782
Either way, the lore doesn't say
anything about exceptions to the cure.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.249
The lore. Hunters.

06:21.414 --> 06:26.056
Men of Letters.
What a load of crap it all is.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.536
- You got nothing?
- You want me to debate you?

06:33.526 --> 06:37.372
- This isn't even the real you I'm talking to.
- Oh, it's the real me, all right.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.375
The new real me.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.739
The me that sees things
for what they really are.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.907
Winchesters.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.210
Do-gooders.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.819
Fighting the natural order.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.114
Let me tell you something.
Guys like me, we are the natural order.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.385
- It's the way it was set up.
- Guys like me...

06:55.882 --> 06:57.327
...still gotta do what we can.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.088
Don't be so full of yourself, Sammy.
You see, from where I'm sitting...

07:01.254 --> 07:04.599
...there ain't much difference
from what I turned into to what you are.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.828
What does that mean?

07:05.992 --> 07:08.233
I know what you did
when you were looking for me.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.999
And I know how far you went.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.471
Crowley told me all about it.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.737
So let me ask you:

07:16.970 --> 07:20.440
Which one of us is really the monster? Hm?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.622
Starting to come back to you now?

07:32.085 --> 07:35.032
What am I supposed to do now?

07:35.522 --> 07:38.128
It's like my life is over.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.134
Thank you.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.873
Bitch.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.373
I should have seen it coming.

07:47.267 --> 07:51.340
Why doesn't anything ever work out for me?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.310
Hey there.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.687
- Hi.
- Sounds like, uh...

07:57.844 --> 08:00.381
...things have been a little rough
on you lately, huh?

08:00.613 --> 08:02.388
Rough?

08:02.782 --> 08:06.787
- My wife kicked me to the curb.
- Oh.

08:06.953 --> 08:11.026
We haven't had sex for four months. Four.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.302
Well, not that she hasn't
been having plenty.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.307
A guy in her bowling league.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.011
The guy with tattoos.

08:21.901 --> 08:25.314
Did him right there on the kitchen table
while I was at work.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.849
Man, that's, uh...

08:29.009 --> 08:30.750
That's cold.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.187
Now, all I think of is revenge.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.994
Payback.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.826
But that's not gonna happen.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.326
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

08:48.862 --> 08:53.868
It is possible that you can
have your revenge.

08:54.167 --> 08:58.843
I mean, hell, it's possible you can have
pretty much anything you want.

09:00.673 --> 09:05.179
You were trying to get a 20 on Crowley
and me from any demon you could snag.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.959
But Crowley didn't wanna be found
and no one showed when you summoned.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.694
But you found a way, didn't you, Sam?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.596
All right.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.104
Stand right here.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.472
When I say so, read the
words off the paper.

09:26.633 --> 09:30.080
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. Trust me.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.481
All right. Go ahead.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.919
Okay.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.591
Who summons me and for what purpose?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.806
- Kill my wife...
- Lester.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.500
- ...and my soul is yours.
- Don't!

09:59.666 --> 10:01.646
- Done.
- No!

10:01.901 --> 10:04.973
You'd have liked to have gotten there
before the deal went down...

10:05.138 --> 10:09.086
...but you didn't really care
about poor old Lester, did you?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.020
Why don't we try that again?

10:15.248 --> 10:18.957
Nobody knows where
Crowley and your brother are.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.503
They're off the radar.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.684
Ah! Kill me if you want to!

10:41.941 --> 10:44.444
That's all I know.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.217
I got nothing for you...

10:48.448 --> 10:53.022
...and you made that poor son of a bitch
sell his soul.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.166
Oh, and so you know...

10:55.321 --> 10:57.392
...I killed Lester myself.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.559
That wife of his married the tattooed guy.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.034
- I never meant...
- Who cares what you meant?

11:03.196 --> 11:08.168
That line that we thought was so clear
between us and the things that we hunted...

11:08.334 --> 11:10.678
...ain't so clear, is it?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.214
Wow.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.185
You might actually be worse than me.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.187
I mean, you took a guy at his lowest,
used him...

11:19.345 --> 11:23.225
...and it cost him his life and his soul.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.090
Nice work.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.275
Let me ask you this, Sammy.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.210
If this doesn't work...

11:47.040 --> 11:49.748
...we both know
what you gotta do to me, right?

11:51.511 --> 11:54.390
You got the stomach for that, Sam?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.730
You stand accused of high treason.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.371
Take her away.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.308
So, what's this then?
Oh, goody, something else to sign.

12:16.636 --> 12:20.209
"Henceforth and forthwith. -.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.486
...for the furtherance...

12:23.643 --> 12:26.590
...and expedience and regulation and..."

12:26.813 --> 12:29.794
Yeah. Sure.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.658
Majesty, supplicants await without.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.657
Without what?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.499
Outside.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.266
Let them wait.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.567
They've waited a longtime.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.611
It's hell. You wait. It's what you do.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.609
You're still here.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.275
I have an update on the angel Castiel.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.619
His grace seems to be fading.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.451
He's losing strength.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.621
If one were so inclined...

13:03.783 --> 13:07.629
...this would be a propitious time
for one to eliminate him.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.293
"One"?

13:10.256 --> 13:11.758
You, sire.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.763
Borrowed grace does have a puny shelf life.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.265
Castiel should've read the warning label.

13:19.932 --> 13:20.967
Follow him...

13:21.134 --> 13:24.115
...and keep me informed as to his decline.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.952
What's going on here?

13:35.114 --> 13:36.855
- What's it look like?
- In my bed?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.057
- Jerk.
- Bitch.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.492
Knock it down.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.293
- Stop talking.
- You're bunging it! Unh!

13:43.456 --> 13:44.730
The king of hell...

13:45.024 --> 13:48.904
...Dean Winchester by his side.
Together we rule, together we create...

13:49.062 --> 13:51.235
...the perfect hell.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.236
Great One?

13:57.737 --> 13:59.683
Your Majesty?

14:00.239 --> 14:02.048
Are you all right?

14:03.076 --> 14:05.750
- I was thinking of better days.
- Yes.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.589
- Your sabbatical.
- My what?

14:08.981 --> 14:10.426
We were worried, of course.

14:10.583 --> 14:16.261
Your misadventure with the older Winchester
was quite the topic of speculation.

14:17.557 --> 14:21.095
If you'll forgive my boldness...

14:22.562 --> 14:25.270
...I could now be your wingman.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.534
Could you?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.106
I too love to party.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.943
And I do love the ladies.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.551
And the classic rock 'n' roll.

14:34.707 --> 14:39.053
Most importantly, I can debauch by your side
without being a personal embarrassment.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.452
You'll see what I'm worth.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.720
Oh, I can see already.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.372
Anyone else care to comment?

15:02.602 --> 15:06.914
Sorry. I missed another turn.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.620
I have no idea where the main road is.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.793
These things, they're so confining...

15:16.949 --> 15:19.259
...and primitive. it's...

15:20.787 --> 15:22.994
It's getting worse, isn't it?

15:24.557 --> 15:27.800
Castiel, it's time we stop
avoiding the obvious.

15:27.994 --> 15:32.101
You and I both know how to fix this,
both you and the situation.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.303
I will not slit some angel's throat
and steal its grace.

15:35.568 --> 15:39.948
Before you say it, we definitely
are not going begging to Metatron.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.314
What about helping your friend...

15:43.643 --> 15:46.590
...and sending the rogue angels
back to heaven?

15:46.746 --> 15:50.626
Your preference to die for your principles,
it's very noble but it is meaningless.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.790
Then you carry on.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.659
I'm not enough.

15:54.854 --> 15:58.028
Sometimes enough is whatever you have.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.710
Sam.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.550
Cass.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.385
- Hey, are you still coming'?
- I'm a few hours away.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.226
- Is the treatment working?
- No, not very well.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.887
It's not like it was with Crowley.
Dean's in pain.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.727
I mean, he's in bad pain.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.233
It's like he's barely holding on.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.834
Cass, it might be killing him.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.673
It might be.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.244
80...

16:42.535 --> 16:45.038
- What, should I stop?
- And do what?

16:46.005 --> 16:50.147
He's not possessed.
Exorcism is out of the question.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.558
The ritual of purified blood
is the only treatment I know.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.524
Cass, did you not hear what I just said?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.186
- I could be killing my brother.
- Sam.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.390
He's not your brother. At least not now.

17:02.655 --> 17:06.034
- You have to be prepared for...
- Killing my brother.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.707
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Yeah, all right, I'll, uh...

17:12.865 --> 17:16.403
I'll leave the entry unlocked for you.
Just hurry.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.250
Hey-Hey. Dean!

17:25.411 --> 17:27.584
Come on. Come back.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.453
Come back to me. Are you there? Hey.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.958
- Dean. You okay?
- Unh.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.963
Yeah, if you can say that...

17:36.222 --> 17:40.068
...drowning in your own sweat
while your blood boils is okay.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.467
- Look, I can't stop doing this.
- Sure you can.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.970
You just stop.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.643
No point in trying to
bring your brother back.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.750
- I will bring him back.
- In fact, your...

17:55.074 --> 18:01.218
"guilt-ridden, weight-of-the-world bro
has been MIA for quite some time now.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.284
But I'm loving the new model.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.662
Lean mean Dean.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.329
Right.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.331
You noticed I tried to get
as far away from you as possible?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.767
Away from your whining,
your complaining.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.669
I chose the king of hell over you.

18:18.664 --> 18:22.476
Maybe I was just tired
of babysitting you...

18:22.635 --> 18:27.141
...or always having to yank your lame ass
out of the fire since forever.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.513
Or maybe" ..

18:29.742 --> 18:34.316
Maybe it was the fact that my mother
would still be alive if it wasn't for you.

18:36.449 --> 18:41.364
That your very existence
sucked the life out of my life.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.858
This isn't my brother talking.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.833
You never had a brother.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.535
Just an excuse for not manning up.

18:49.695 --> 18:50.867
But guess what.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.770
- I quit.
- No. No, you don't.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.036
You don't get to quit.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.213
We don't get to quit in this family.

18:58.371 --> 19:02.820
- This family is all we have ever had.
- Well, then we got nothing.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.886
- Would you say that to Dad?
- Dad?

19:05.511 --> 19:07.047
Oh, there's a prize.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.883
Here's a man who brainwashed us...

19:09.048 --> 19:13.292
...into wasting our lives
fighting his losing battle.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.155
Oh. Ooh.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.693
Is this you manning up?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.201
This is me...

19:20.359 --> 19:23.306
...yanking your lame ass out of the fire.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.874
You're welcome.

19:45.518 --> 19:49.022
You have coerced others
into aligning with Abaddon.

19:49.188 --> 19:54.536
You spread rumors and foster doubt as to
the competence and authority of the crown.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.870
Guilty of treason.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.839
The sentence is death.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.211
Anyone else hungry to betray me?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.613
Next.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.719
You're guilty of something...

20:15.881 --> 20:18.555
...which I won't tolerate, whatever it was.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.562
- You are condemned...
- Stop.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.198
Stop.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.390
"Stop"?

20:24.557 --> 20:25.900
You cannot do this.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.538
Weren't you watching?
Of course I can. I just did.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.037
This is your idea of ruling?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.065
Yes.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.074
We've killed and tortured for you.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.712
Stolen souls, destroyed lives.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.748
Tempted and tormented with distinction.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.078
And for all of this, what's our reward?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.552
A slap in the face.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.553
Stay back.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.586
What is it?

20:49.815 --> 20:54.889
You disappear, binge on blood,
approach the edge of becoming human.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.092
Salt in the wound? You run off
with your boy toy, Dean Winchester.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.261
Now he's running amok
and you can't control him or the kingdom.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.268
- What's he doing?
- You've squandered our loyalty.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.103
What will you do?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.337
Not live in the hell you've made.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.604
Stop.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.109
it's holy Oil!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.317
Get back. Get back.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.793
Did not see that coming.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.528
Hm.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.143
Hannah.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.717
You know, this road we're on,
it's dangerous.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.849
All right.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.720
Um...

21:56.215 --> 21:58.491
We can't afford to lose our way.

21:59.218 --> 22:02.062
I know that. I'm sorry about the map.

22:03.222 --> 22:06.465
No detours of any kind.

22:08.494 --> 22:12.738
Castiel, if these are metaphors and you're
attempting another human communication...

22:12.965 --> 22:14.069
...it isn't working.

22:16.969 --> 22:20.075
I'm just trying to say that this mission,
it's everything.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.679
I know that.

22:23.709 --> 22:26.747
Getting to Dean, hunting these rogues, I...

22:26.912 --> 22:30.382
I'm not at full capacity so I...

22:30.549 --> 22:33.723
We need total focus.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.498
Like a laser. Got it.

22:36.755 --> 22:37.927
Just...

22:38.090 --> 22:43.699
I've been around humans for long enough
to see how easily distractions occur.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.602
"Distractions."

22:48.267 --> 22:51.373
Emotions, feelings.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.746
They're dangerous temptations.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.942
How very biblical, Castiel.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.615
I don't mean to be unkind.

23:02.615 --> 23:06.529
- You don't mean to be kind.
- I just...

23:07.119 --> 23:09.565
I'm trying to keep our priorities clear.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.434
Not to worry, then.
I am very clear on my priorities...

23:13.592 --> 23:15.299
...and yours.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.089
Hello'?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.082
Hey, there.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.662
I've been tracking you.
You will be punished for what you did.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.821
Daniel's death,
that was unintentional, Adina.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.024
- I feel you know this.
- "Unintentional"?

24:17.189 --> 24:18.463
You killed him.

24:21.860 --> 24:22.964
Seriously?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.539
Just kill me...

24:31.704 --> 24:32.978
...but let her go.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.477
Stop.

24:34.873 --> 24:35.874
"Stop?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.445
"Kill me." So many suggestions.
Don't know what to do.

24:39.845 --> 24:43.054
I know. I will kill you, Castiel,
but very, very slowly...

24:43.215 --> 24:45.024
...so your honeybunch...

24:46.185 --> 24:47.391
...can watch.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.463
Sound good? Unh!

26:43.402 --> 26:45.279
Hey, champ.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.081
Look at you.

26:49.575 --> 26:50.918
Talk about roadkill.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.800
- Unh! Unh! Unh!
- Thattagirl, Hannah.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.305
Suffer.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.603
Just like my Daniel suffered
before you killed him.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.872
Daniel's death isn't on my head,
it's on yours.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.174
We did nothing.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.941
We wanted nothing...

27:22.107 --> 27:23.780
...but to be left alone.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.786
You killed an angel.
You had to answer for it.

27:26.945 --> 27:30.449
An angel who would've hauled us back
to that heaven of yours?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.220
He should have left us alone.

27:33.552 --> 27:36.055
And that will do.

27:50.536 --> 27:54.882
Why can't you people just sit on clouds
and play harps like you're supposed to'?

29:28.967 --> 29:31.311
Come on, Sammy.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.812
Don't you wanna hang out
with your big brother'?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.815
Spend a little quality time.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.195
Don't be an idiot. Yes, it's hers.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.362
But she was killing your girlfriend.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.692
Your hands are clean.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.798
As much as it pains me to say this...

29:52.324 --> 29:54.804
...you're useless to me dead.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.320
You owe me.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.529
- Why did you help me?
- Purely business.

30:19.685 --> 30:24.293
Since you're 5 miles from the Winchesters', I
can only surmise that you're headed there...

30:24.456 --> 30:27.300
...and that Dean has become a handful.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.305
Having him as a demon
has caused me nothing but grief.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.237
Fix the problem.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.341
You realize, if worse comes to worst...

30:36.535 --> 30:37.809
...that means killing him.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.048
I'm not sentimental.

31:45.804 --> 31:48.114
Smart, Sam.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.811
Locking the place down.

31:50.976 --> 31:54.048
Doors won't open. I get it.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.657
But here's the thing.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.289
I don't wanna leave.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.131
Not till I find you.

32:13.799 --> 32:16.075
Sammy!

32:18.069 --> 32:21.346
You're just making this worse
for yourself, man.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.981
Oh, by the way, you can, uh...

32:26.244 --> 32:29.316
...blame yourself for me getting loose.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.755
All that blood you pumped into me
to make me human?

32:33.919 --> 32:37.696
Well, the less demon I was,
the less the cuffs worked.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.434
And that devil's trap?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.164
Well, I just walked right across it.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.273
It smarted...

32:48.200 --> 32:50.180
...but still...

33:31.309 --> 33:33.346
That's more like it.

33:39.584 --> 33:43.532
- That's your big move?
- Listen to me, Dean.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.259
We were getting close, okay?

33:46.424 --> 33:48.836
I know you're still in there somewhere.

33:48.994 --> 33:51.668
Just let me finish the treatments.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.668
Dean?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.749
You act like I wanna be cured.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.751
Personally, I like the disease.

34:12.016 --> 34:15.089
Dean, stop that! Look, I don't wanna
use this blade on you.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.393
That sucks for you, doesn't it?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.764
Because you really mean that. Ha, ha.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.699
If you come out of that room,
I won't have a choice.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.605
Sure, you will.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.775
And I know which one you'll make.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.882
Ain't that right, Sammy? But see...

34:34.139 --> 34:37.052
...here's the thing. I'm lucky.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.652
Oh, hell, I'm blessed.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.813
Because there's just enough demon
left in me that killing you...

34:41.980 --> 34:43.288
...ain't no choice at all.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.466
Sammy?

35:00.732 --> 35:02.939
Come on, Sammy.

35:03.668 --> 35:06.911
Let's have a beer. Talk about it.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.346
I'm tired of playing.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.456
Let's finish this game.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.493
Well...

35:26.191 --> 35:29.035
Well, look at you.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.037
Do it.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.110
It's all you.

35:51.883 --> 35:52.953
it's over.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.322
- Dean, it's over.
- Argh!

35:57.022 --> 35:58.365
Argh!

35:59.858 --> 36:02.065
it's over.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.647
What the hell are we doing to him, Cass?

36:18.810 --> 36:22.883
I mean, even after I gave him all that blood,
he still said he didn't wanna be cured...

36:23.214 --> 36:25.820
...that he didn't wanna be human.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.830
Well, I can see his point.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.931
You know, only humans can feel real joy...

36:35.093 --> 36:37.095
...but also such profound pain.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.503
This is easier.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.968
You look worried, fellas.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.223
Welcome back, Dean.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.252
Hey.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.948
How's he doing?

38:04.282 --> 38:07.957
He's still a little out of it.
But better, I think.

38:08.119 --> 38:12.761
I mean, I think this whole thing,
the blood cure and the-— All of it.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.837
- Really wrecked him, you know?
- Yeah.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.974
On the plus side, he's hungry again.

38:18.129 --> 38:22.771
So I'm just gonna go pick him up a big old bag
of crap food and stuff it in his face myself.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.140
You mind keeping an eye?

38:25.804 --> 38:26.839
Yeah.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.349
- Sam.
- Yeah?

38:29.607 --> 38:32.520
You realize one problem is solved
but one still remains.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.654
Dean is no longer a demon, that's true.

38:36.648 --> 38:40.790
But the mark of Cain, that he still has. And
sooner or later, that's gonna be an issue.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.364
You know what, Cass? I'm beat, man.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.828
One battle at a time, you know?

38:46.624 --> 38:51.505
So I'm just gonna go grab my brother
some cholesterol.

38:53.231 --> 38:54.801
And then I'm gonna get drunk.

39:17.555 --> 39:18.761
Yeah?

39:20.758 --> 39:22.260
You look terrible.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.769
It wouldn't kill you to lie
every now and again.

39:26.064 --> 39:29.045
No, it wouldn't kill me. I just... You...

39:29.701 --> 39:31.078
Forget it.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.544
Well, you, on the other hand...

39:36.374 --> 39:38.183
...you're looking good.

39:39.344 --> 39:42.757
- So are you back?
- At least temporarily.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.723
Yeah, it's a long story.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.055
Crowley.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.426
Stolen grace.
There's a female outside in the car.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.698
Another time.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.062
Well, thank you...

39:54.225 --> 39:57.104
...for stepping in when you did.

40:00.698 --> 40:04.111
What'd Sam say? Does he want a divorce?

40:04.435 --> 40:08.076
I'm sure Sam knows that
whatever you said...

40:08.306 --> 40:11.446
...or what you did, that wasn't really you.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.088
Certainly it wasn't all you.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.558
- I tried to kill him, Cass.
- Dean.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.587
You two have been through so much.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.761
Look, you're brothers.

40:20.919 --> 40:24.890
It would take a lot more than trying to kill
Sam with a hammer to make him walk away.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.466
You realize how screwed up our lives are
that that even makes sense.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.966
I'm glad you're here, man.

40:37.735 --> 40:40.579
Hey, maybe you should...

40:41.172 --> 40:45.086
...take some time before you get back
to work. Allow yourself to heal.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.083
It's, uh...

40:47.245 --> 40:49.623
I don't know. The timing might be right.

40:49.847 --> 40:52.919
Heaven and hell,
they seem reasonably back in order.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.189
It's quiet out there.
