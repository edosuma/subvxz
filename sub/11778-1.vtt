00:10.810 --> 00:14.414
This isn't "Beginner Master."
This is [bleep] <i> Ink Master.</i>

[Dave] Welcome, artists.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.585

Ahh!

[announcer] <i> Tattooing human</i>
<i>canvases...</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:29.095

-You know what? You're right.

[announcer] <i> ...in more strenuous</i>

ridiculous.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.504
[announcer]
<i>Their masterpieces...</i>

00:37.570 --> 00:38.972
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.474
[announcer] <i> ...and mistakes</i>
<i>will last forever.</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:43.243
I put everything into this,
and you come here

00:43.309 --> 00:44.744
and make a goddamn joke
out of it.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.112
Pisses me off, man.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.715
[announcer] <i> Judged by top names</i>
<i>in the industry...</i>

00:48.782 --> 00:49.983
Everybody needs
to get ready

00:50.049 --> 00:52.152
'cause this is a rough
[bleep] day.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.154
Bottom line is I'm 100 % happy
with what I turned out.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.922
It don't matter what you say,
what you do.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.924
It matters what the [bleep]
you tattoo.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.292
[announcer] <i> They'll be</i>
<i>eliminated</i>

00:59.359 --> 01:02.128
<i>until only the best tattoo</i>
<i>artist remains...</i>

01:02.195 --> 01:03.463
You [bleep] suck
as an artist!

01:03.530 --> 01:06.299
[announcer] <i> ...earning</i>
<i>a $100,000 prize...</i>

01:06.366 --> 01:08.435
Y'all better get
this mother[bleep] right now.

01:08.501 --> 01:12.906
[announcer] <i> ...and the title...</i>

01:12.972 --> 01:16.209
[rock music]

02:03.890 --> 02:06.559
[rock music]

02:12.265 --> 02:14.767
{\an8}I can't believe that I'm
actually here-- this is real.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.302
{\an8}[man] <i> Now it's go time.</i>

02:16.369 --> 02:18.204
{\an8}<i>All that preparation, mentally,</i>
<i>that you thought you did</i>

02:18.271 --> 02:19.706
{\an8}goes out the window.

02:20.807 --> 02:21.808
[woman] Wow...

02:21.875 --> 02:23.409
{\an8}What the [bleep]
is going on?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.411
{\an8}<i>There's barbed wire,</i>
<i>there's bars.</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:27.447
{\an8}We're actually at a prison.

02:27.514 --> 02:28.681
[man] Let's go.
Keep the noise down.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.284
-Walk this way!
-Yes, sir.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.220
{\an8}I'm in [bleep] hell.
I've been to jail before.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.556
<i>It's a bad place.</i>
<i>It's not fun.</i>

02:36.623 --> 02:38.324
I'm not [bleep] happy.

02:45.832 --> 02:46.966
[Dave] Welcome, artists.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.401
Over the next 12 weeks,

02:48.468 --> 02:50.203
you will live and work
together,

02:50.270 --> 02:52.505
competing in brutal
tattoo challenges

02:52.572 --> 02:56.843
designed to put your skills
to the ultimate test.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.645
In the end, only one
of you will earn

02:58.711 --> 03:03.082
$100,000, a feature
in <i> Inked Magazine,</i>

03:03.149 --> 03:05.718
and the title of Ink Master.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.355
To claim the title
of Ink Master,

03:09.422 --> 03:11.658
you must first impress
these gentlemen.

03:11.724 --> 03:15.161
First up-- he travels
around the world tattooing,

03:15.228 --> 03:17.430
and specializes
in American traditional,

03:17.497 --> 03:19.766
the legendary Oliver Peck.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.135
[applause]

03:22.201 --> 03:23.603
[Oliver] <i> Just 'cause you saw</i>
<i>last season</i>

03:23.670 --> 03:25.171
{\an8}doesn't mean you know
what to expect.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.673
<i>Nothing's gonna be easy.</i>

03:26.739 --> 03:29.008
If it was easy,
the prize would be 20 bucks.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.711
Next up, he has spent
the last 20 years

03:31.778 --> 03:32.946
tattooing around the globe,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.381
and just opened Miami's hottest
new tattoo shop

03:35.448 --> 03:37.817
and art gallery,
Hand Crafted.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.152
Mr. Chris Núñez.

03:39.218 --> 03:41.087
[applause]

03:41.154 --> 03:42.789
[Chris] <i> Here we are,</i>
<i>season three.</i>

03:42.855 --> 03:44.324
<i>More than ever, people</i>
<i>know what they're in for.</i>

03:44.390 --> 03:46.192
{\an8}<i>So if you really feel like</i>
<i>you're the one</i>

03:46.259 --> 03:47.560
{\an8}walking away with the check,

03:47.627 --> 03:48.928
<i>then you have to claim</i>
<i>that check.</i>

03:48.995 --> 03:51.297
And what comes along with it
are bumps and bruises.

03:51.364 --> 03:54.000
And, of course, I'll be
your third judge.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.835
<i>There are definitely some</i>
<i>really</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.270
<i>strong artists in this group.</i>

03:57.337 --> 03:59.906
<i>Whoever wins this thing</i>
<i>is gonna have to do the work</i>

03:59.973 --> 04:01.074
<i>and get the [bleep] out.</i>

04:01.140 --> 04:03.977
{\an8}This competition is not
a walk in the park.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.678
And once again,
Spike and Taco Bell

04:05.745 --> 04:08.615
are giving the viewers
the opportunity to be a judge.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.450
Each week, viewers at home
will scour

04:10.516 --> 04:13.286
every detail
of your elimination tattoos

04:13.353 --> 04:15.388
at InkMaster.Spike.com

04:15.455 --> 04:18.458
and vote for the tattoo
that they think is the best.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.361
America's vote will have
a huge impact on the outcome

04:21.427 --> 04:23.863
of the live finale.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.065
{\an8}America voting
freaks me out.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.367
<i>I've gotta be on my game.</i>

04:27.433 --> 04:29.569
At the end of last season,
America voted

04:29.636 --> 04:32.071
to give a second chance
to an eliminated artist

04:32.138 --> 04:34.240
that they felt
deserved it the most.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.377
<i>The artist who gets the most</i>
votes...<i> Tatu Baby.</i>

04:37.443 --> 04:39.312
[cheers and applause]

04:39.379 --> 04:42.849
<i>We will be seeing you</i>
<i>next season on</i> Ink Master.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.618
Tatu Baby, come on out.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.389
{\an8}I'm back and I'm here to win.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.491
<i>I'm very thankful for everybody</i>
<i>who voted for me.</i>

04:51.557 --> 04:52.892
I'm just on such
a different level

04:52.959 --> 04:54.127
than I was last season.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.928
-I'm ready.
-[Dave] Welcome back.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.832
[woman] <i> Tatu Baby coming back--</i>
<i>she's been through this before.</i>

04:59.899 --> 05:03.102
{\an8}That's definitely a threat.
Completely.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.404
Now to the Flash Challenge,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.439
a skills test where the winner
will gain an advantage

05:06.506 --> 05:09.075
going into
the elimination tattoo.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.643
Tattooing would not be
the same

05:10.710 --> 05:13.413
without the place
you're standing in... prison.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.517
Some of the industry's
most notable tattoo artists

05:17.583 --> 05:19.419
learned how to tattoo
behind bars.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.722
Today, you will become part
of that legacy.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.924
For this Flash Challenge,
your human canvas

05:24.991 --> 05:27.460
is behind bars.

05:28.027 --> 05:28.928
Oh, [bleep].

05:28.995 --> 05:31.731
{\an8}No [bleep] way.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.999
[Dave] It's essential
that artists vent

05:33.066 --> 05:34.500
any obstacle
they are faced with.

05:34.567 --> 05:38.004
Which is why this week
we are testing your flexibility.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.907
You'll especially need it
in this Flash Challenge,

05:40.973 --> 05:42.909
because while you can tattoo
any design you want

05:42.975 --> 05:43.910
on your canvas,

05:43.976 --> 05:47.013
you must tattoo
"prison style,"

05:47.080 --> 05:49.582
using only a single needle.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.818
-[Jackie whistles]
-[bleep].

05:51.884 --> 05:54.153
With a single needle,
it's all or nothing.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.154
The smaller the needle,
the more

05:55.221 --> 05:57.290
every unsteady line
stands out.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.492
{\an8}There's very little room
for error.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.827
<i>You go to deep,</i>
<i>you [bleep] it up.</i>

06:00.893 --> 06:02.829
<i>You don't go deep enough,</i>
<i>it's not gonna be there.</i>

06:02.895 --> 06:04.564
<i>Making this</i>
<i>the first challenge,</i>

06:04.630 --> 06:06.365
we are rattling
[bleep] cages.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.434
[Dave] Each of you will have
90 minutes

06:08.501 --> 06:11.170
to complete your
single-needle tattoo.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.505
Let's go meet
your canvases.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.575
{\an8}Tattooing in a prison,
that's crazy.

06:15.641 --> 06:17.577
{\an8}I'm hoping that I'm
going to be tattooing

06:17.643 --> 06:20.079
{\an8}somebody nice,
but I doubt it.

06:29.122 --> 06:35.461
[overlapping excited chatter]

06:35.528 --> 06:40.333
[Joshua] <i> We have real live</i>
<i>inmates that we have to tattoo.</i>

06:40.399 --> 06:42.235
{\an8}It is freaking scary.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.603
[man barking]

06:43.669 --> 06:47.473
{\an8}The first competition
in a jail cell with an inmate--

06:47.540 --> 06:49.208
<i>it's nerve-racking.</i>

06:49.275 --> 06:51.177
[Dave] You have 90 minutes
to complete

06:51.244 --> 06:53.212
your single-needle tattoo,

06:53.279 --> 06:57.083
and your time begins now.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.586
[rock music]

07:00.653 --> 07:02.355
Make sure you wipe your feet
before you come into my house,

07:02.421 --> 07:03.589
all right, mother[bleep]?

07:03.656 --> 07:05.291
[Chris] <i> Technically speaking,</i>
<i>single needle</i>

07:05.358 --> 07:07.627
{\an8}is exactly as it sounds--
it's one needle.

07:07.693 --> 07:10.163
<i>So you're getting</i>
<i>the tiniest amount of coverage</i>

07:10.229 --> 07:11.297
<i>in a very small area.</i>

07:11.364 --> 07:12.698
-90 minutes.
-90 minutes.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.234
To plan it, to set it up,
to get it all done.

07:15.301 --> 07:16.536
Honestly, what we're looking
at getting done

07:16.602 --> 07:18.070
in that amount of time
ain't a lot.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.740
You're in my house right now,
so calm your ass down.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.375
-Calm my ass down?
-You're in my house.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.644
I don't give a [bleep]
where I'm at, man.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.512
If I'm gonna tattoo you,
then you're gonna have to

07:26.579 --> 07:28.247
listen to me as well.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.782
{\an8}I'm not an easy guy
to back down.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.118
{\an8}I just don't.
I'm not a bitch.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.921
[Maddie] Ready to rock and roll.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.126
Wow.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.460
The only two people
right now that give a [bleep]

07:41.527 --> 07:43.696
about you getting a good tattoo
or not is me and you.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.465
<i>Coming into a competition</i>
<i>like this,</i>

07:46.532 --> 07:48.401
{\an8}you don't have to swim faster
than the other fish.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.503
<i>You just have to swim</i>
<i>fast enough</i>

07:50.570 --> 07:52.004
to not be eaten
by the shark.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.507
<i>I'm self-taught,</i>
<i>I don't really have a style.</i>

07:54.574 --> 07:56.809
<i>I just kind of like</i>
<i>doing my thing and making art.</i>

07:56.876 --> 07:58.678
This tat means so much
to me.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.279
[Mike] <i> I've never done</i>
<i>a single-needle tattoo.</i>

08:00.346 --> 08:02.949
{\an8}I really have no idea how
the skin's gonna react to this.

08:03.015 --> 08:07.286
<i>My style of tattooing is</i>
<i>bio-organic and illustrative.</i>

08:07.353 --> 08:09.555
-[man] Yo, Adam.
-Yo, yo.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.924
[man] I thought your tattoo
artist was my visit.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.826
[Ally] They better watch
what they say

08:13.893 --> 08:15.094
'cause a little
blonde girl's gonna

08:15.161 --> 08:16.596
put some foot
up in their ass.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.231
<i>I'm a legitimate tattoo artist,</i>

08:18.297 --> 08:20.166
{\an8}not just some pretty
blonde girl.

08:20.233 --> 08:24.036
<i>I specialize in loud,</i>
<i>in-your-face, ridiculous color.</i>

08:24.103 --> 08:26.239
<i>I like the "wow" factor.</i>

08:27.473 --> 08:28.407
Goddamn!

08:28.474 --> 08:30.643
I'm stuck with this
for life, man.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.445
It's on your skin,
but it's on my name.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.746
My name's MADE Rich.
<i>I have a custom,</i>

08:34.813 --> 08:37.817
<i>flowy-animation</i>
<i>realistic kind of style.</i>

08:37.884 --> 08:40.352
{\an8}"MADE" stands for money,
attitude, direction, education.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.654
<i>That's the key to success.</i>

08:41.721 --> 08:44.123
I'm here to get money,
so it all makes sense to me.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.460
[Kyle] I'm gonna put a badass
piece on you, Zell.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.629
[Zell] Cool, I don't want to
rearrange nobody's face.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.099
[Kyle] <i> I'm gonna do whatever</i>
<i>it takes to win this.</i>

08:53.165 --> 08:54.567
I need $100,000.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.569
<i>I've been tattooing</i>
<i>18 years.</i>

08:56.636 --> 08:58.471
<i>Put it this way,</i>
<i>I've been doing good tattoos</i>

08:58.537 --> 09:00.139
<i>for six years.</i>

09:00.206 --> 09:01.674
[bleep] before.

09:01.741 --> 09:04.477
-<i> Karakasa.</i>
-<i> Karakasa.</i>

09:04.543 --> 09:07.079
It's a Japanese
demonic umbrella.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.615
{\an8}An umbrella demon.

09:09.682 --> 09:10.950
This thing is weird, man.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.985
<i>It's probably the worst tattoo</i>
<i>that I've ever done,</i>

09:13.052 --> 09:14.120
but at least he's happy.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.055
<i>I am primarily known</i>
<i>for photo-realism.</i>

09:16.122 --> 09:17.623
<i>I've been tattooing</i>
<i>for ten years,</i>

09:17.690 --> 09:19.258

<i>the best artist</i>

09:19.325 --> 09:21.093
<i>in any situation</i>
<i>I've ever been in.</i>

09:21.160 --> 09:22.495
I am going to win this.

09:22.561 --> 09:23.763
I walked in and I was, like,

09:23.829 --> 09:26.132
"What the hell
did I sign up for?"

09:26.198 --> 09:29.001
{\an8}People don't expect this accent
to come from this mouth.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.970
<i>I call myself, like,</i>
<i>a southern belle</i>

09:31.037 --> 09:31.837
with a little twist.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.774
<i>I love girlie, cutesy stuff.</i>

09:34.840 --> 09:37.777
<i>I also like the dark,</i>
<i>evil stuff too.</i>

09:37.843 --> 09:39.779
What are you in here
for, man?

09:39.845 --> 09:41.914
I don't want to talk
about that part.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.317
{\an8}I'm here to prove myself
to other tattooers

09:44.383 --> 09:46.052
<i>that think I suck</i>
<i>just because</i>

09:46.118 --> 09:48.020
<i>I'm a young kid</i>
<i>in this industry.</i>

09:48.087 --> 09:52.792
<i>I love doing portraiture</i>
<i>and American traditional.</i>

09:52.858 --> 09:54.126
[Jime] <i> I've been tattooing now</i>
<i>for about 20 years.</i>

09:54.193 --> 09:56.796
<i>My style is very animated,</i>
<i>new school.</i>

09:56.862 --> 09:58.965
<i>It's all about winning. It's</i>
<i>either gonna be you or me--</i>

09:59.031 --> 10:00.833
{\an8}damn well sure believe
it's gonna be me.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.668
[Joshua] <i> Jime Litwalk,</i>
<i>I've looked up to his work</i>

10:02.735 --> 10:04.570
<i>from the moment</i>
<i>I started tattooing.</i>

10:04.637 --> 10:06.706
{\an8}I see him as
the number-one threat here.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.278
{\an8}I've been tattooing
for about 16 years.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.813
<i>Black-and-gray work,</i>
<i>hard line.</i>

10:13.879 --> 10:15.581
<i>People always judge me</i>
<i>off the riff.</i>

10:15.648 --> 10:17.416
<i>"He's probably just</i>
<i>some kid from the hood."</i>

10:17.483 --> 10:18.584
<i>But I got skills.</i>

10:18.651 --> 10:20.152
I prove it every time.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.221
60 minutes remaining.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.824
[rock music]

10:28.294 --> 10:29.528
{\an8}This season,
I'm coming to show

10:29.595 --> 10:30.863
{\an8}that I'm a lot more diverse.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.599
<i>I went and did my homework,</i>
<i>and I definitely have</i>

10:33.666 --> 10:36.602
<i>a couple of things</i>
<i>to impress everybody with.</i>

10:36.669 --> 10:37.970
[Jime] <i> I don't think Tatu Baby's</i>
<i>an Ink Master.</i>

10:38.037 --> 10:39.672
<i>She's good at a lot of things,</i>

10:39.739 --> 10:42.308
{\an8}but I don't think
she's the best at it.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.176
So you bad
at that new school, huh?

10:45.778 --> 10:48.047
[Craig] <i> I've definitely not</i>
<i>settled on just being</i>

10:48.114 --> 10:49.782
<i>a great new-school</i>
<i>tattoo artist,</i>

10:49.849 --> 10:52.752
{\an8}but I've picked up a lot
of other tricks along the way.

10:53.853 --> 10:54.854
[Joey] <i> A lot of the people,</i>
<i>mentally,</i>

10:54.920 --> 10:56.522
{\an8}they probably think
they can win.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.656
<i>But I know I can win.</i>

10:57.723 --> 10:59.792
<i>Photo-realism is one</i>
<i>of my specialties.</i>

10:59.859 --> 11:01.494
<i>I love taking</i>
<i>that picture</i>

11:01.560 --> 11:03.529
<i>and trying to reproduce it</i>
<i>on the skin.</i>

11:03.596 --> 11:05.331
You could make a lot
of money in here.

11:05.398 --> 11:09.168
No, I'm gonna stay the [bleep]
way out of here, man.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.437
<i>The strategy is just</i>
<i>the eye of the tiger, baby.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:13.172
{\an8}You've gotta make it happen.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.709
<i>The style I'm most known for</i>
<i>would be full-body Japanese.</i>

11:16.776 --> 11:18.944
Kind of with my little white
boy twist put on there.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.148
Been a while since I felt
that needle.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.849
[Jackie] This one's
thin as hell too.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.118
{\an8}I've been tattooing
for about ten years.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.120
<i>I actually like to be</i>
<i>very diverse.</i>

11:28.187 --> 11:32.091
<i>I don't want to limit myself</i>
<i>to one specific style.</i>

11:32.158 --> 11:35.094
Ten minutes remaining,
everybody, ten minutes.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.996
[needle buzzing]

11:39.532 --> 11:41.700
{\an8}I like tattoos
with meat on their bones.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.169
<i>Really visually aggressive.</i>

11:43.235 --> 11:45.805
<i>I built a reputation</i>
<i>for being the guy you go to</i>

11:45.871 --> 11:46.772
if you want it don't right.

11:46.839 --> 11:51.243
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

11:51.310 --> 11:55.247
six, five, four,

11:55.314 --> 11:57.883
three, two, one.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.652
Time is up, machines down.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.855
-[Dave] No more ink.
-Whoo!

12:03.856 --> 12:05.658
[Maddie] <i> I am not happy.</i>

12:05.724 --> 12:07.660
{\an8}I know that mine is nothing

12:07.726 --> 12:09.562
{\an8}of what I would
regularly tattoo.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.397
I'm a little embarrassed.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.136
{\an8}There will be
a human canvas jury.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.170
{\an8}-Wow.
-No way.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.072
{\an8}Pack your bags.
Go [bleep] home now.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.273
[Joshua] There's no crying
in tattooing,

12:21.340 --> 12:23.242
and everybody should be
fighting to the death.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.343
This is a competition.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.280
[rock music]

12:31.951 --> 12:36.021
[Dave] All right, artists,
time to critique your work.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.823
-Rich.
-Never in my life

12:37.890 --> 12:39.091
have I used
a single needle.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.826
[Chris] It definitely shows
that out of the field,

12:40.893 --> 12:42.495
you probably had
one of the hardest times

12:42.561 --> 12:44.530
doing this outline.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.132
-[Dave] Ally.
-[Oliver] Size-wise,

12:46.198 --> 12:47.700
you went a little bit
too big.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.768
Single needle is
a finely detailed craft.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.137
And when you have
a huge area,

12:51.203 --> 12:54.006
you're not gonna have time
to detail the whole thing out.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.041
-[Dave] Chris.
-[Chris] Looks like you did go

12:56.108 --> 12:57.877
in and bold up
a lot of your outlines.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.845
It would be nice
to see somebody

12:59.912 --> 13:02.181
do one pass single.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.549
-[Dave] Mike.
-[Oliver] Did you plan on

13:03.616 --> 13:04.783
trying to get
some shading in there?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.152
I was hoping to,
actually, yes.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.921
[Chris] To do that many circles
in this situation

13:08.988 --> 13:10.890
when you've never
done single,

13:10.956 --> 13:14.059
you put yourself
on the chopping block.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.762
[James] <i> Mystical Mike's tattoo</i>
<i>is a year-one tattoo.</i>

13:16.829 --> 13:17.963
{\an8}I don't see the kid
having the skill

13:18.030 --> 13:19.398
{\an8}to stay in this game.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.201
-[Dave] Craig.
-[Oliver] Looking at this thing,

13:22.268 --> 13:24.336
there's quite a bit
of inconsistencies.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.572
You got some thick lines,
you've got some thin lines.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.606
Going the size you did,
you might have

13:27.673 --> 13:29.341
bit off
a little bit too much.

13:30.609 --> 13:31.644
[Dave] Kyle.

13:31.710 --> 13:32.678
There's only a few tattoos
we've seen today

13:32.745 --> 13:34.813
that had smooth,
soft shading--

13:34.880 --> 13:35.848
this is one of them.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.383
-Thank you.
-[Dave] Jason.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.817
[Chris] There's a lot of areas
where you can see

13:38.884 --> 13:39.952
it's a one-pass outline.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.854
It shows flexibility.
It shows that

13:41.921 --> 13:43.088
you have an idea
of what you're doing.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.391
-Thanks.
-[Dave] Jime.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.226
[Chris] It's definitely
the cleanest one we've seen.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.361
The shading is
really smooth.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.298
[Dave] Jackie.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.832
[Oliver] The technique you chose
to go through

13:53.899 --> 13:55.267
with the crosshatching
cut a lot of time off of it.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.735
Being flexible
with your elements,

13:56.802 --> 13:58.637
that's the big test here,
and in that sense,

13:58.704 --> 14:00.873
you did pretty good.
-Thank you.

14:00.940 --> 14:01.974
Hi, Baby.
Good to see you again.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.410
-Likewise.
-[Chris] Your outline looks like

14:04.476 --> 14:06.345
you had to double up, and that's
where you see the bumpiness.

14:06.412 --> 14:09.014
But overall, the gray shading
that you used

14:09.081 --> 14:10.382
will heal up okay.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.718
[Dave] Joshua.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.119
[Joshua] This is actually
a broken umbrella

14:14.186 --> 14:15.154
that turned into a demon.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.755
[Oliver] I think
it's the coolest design,

14:16.822 --> 14:17.957
just because
it's outrageous.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.391
He was very particular
about what he wanted,

14:19.458 --> 14:22.194
and it feels like the
translation went pretty well.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.731
[Dave] Frank.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.266
[Oliver] Execution-wise,
it's a single needle.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.867
Keeping it thin
and going a little lighter

14:28.934 --> 14:30.402
would have went a Long way
with this tattoo.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.671
It's definitely in the realms
of being overworked.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.674
[Dave] ES.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.309
Man, there's some great
elements to this tattoo.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.612
A little bit of peppery shading
you got in there

14:39.678 --> 14:42.114
is what the single-needle
tattooing is all about.

14:42.681 --> 14:43.916
[Dave] Joey.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.218
[Chris] You showed that you can
do a clean outline.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.920
You showed texture,
you showed depth.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.421
You got a good one, man.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.423
It'd be fun to watch you
do your other stuff.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.758
[Jime] <i> Joey's definitely gonna</i>
<i>be one of the people</i>

14:52.825 --> 14:54.426
{\an8}who's gonna give me
a run for my money.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.730
[Dave] Maddie.

14:57.796 --> 15:00.466
[Oliver] The legs on a spider
don't come off the bulbous tail.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.068
The legs come off
of the smaller body part.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.704
To me, it looks like
a hairy june bug.

15:05.771 --> 15:08.107
This is definitely one
of the rougher ones for the day.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.709
[Dave] James.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.311
[Oliver] The main thing
I don't like about it

15:12.378 --> 15:14.480
is that it's sailing backwards
on his leg.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.316
We always want to have things
going the right way on the body,

15:17.383 --> 15:19.118
and sailing towards
the front of his leg

15:19.184 --> 15:20.552
would have been
the right way to go.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.924
We tested flexibility today.
Single-needle.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.493
Some really good ones
and some really bad ones.

15:27.559 --> 15:31.630
Maddie's spider was definitely
the worst design of the day.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.799
[Dave] Rich did those playing
cards. I gotta tell you,

15:33.866 --> 15:35.434
I was not a fan
of that tattoo.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.403
[Oliver] Those letters were
jacked.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.104
[Dave] Jime did a nice,
clean piston.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.907
[Oliver] It was the most clean,
professional tattoo that we saw.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.109
I think that Joey showed
a lot of flexibility.

15:44.176 --> 15:47.046
The guy hit lines,
he hit texture, he hit shading.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.647
[Dave] I also liked Kyle's
samurai mask.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.051
[Chris] The lines on that tattoo
were some of the best ones today

15:52.117 --> 15:53.352
because they were consistent.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.853
Well, it looks like
we have a decision.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.522
-[Dave] Let's let 'em know.
-Let's do it.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.192
Today, we tested
your flexibility

16:00.259 --> 16:04.129
by asking you to tattoo
using only a single needle.

16:04.196 --> 16:07.032
The winner of today's
Flash Challenge is...

16:11.103 --> 16:14.239
-Joey.
-[applause]

16:16.075 --> 16:17.910
{\an8}I wanted to be up there
at the top,

16:17.976 --> 16:20.446
<i>but now there's a target</i>
<i>on my back.</i>

16:20.512 --> 16:22.181
It's a little bit scary.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.249
[Dave] As winner
of the Flash Challenge,

16:24.316 --> 16:26.985
you'll have an advantage in
this week's elimination tattoo.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.622
Head back to the loft.
We'll see you at the shop.

-[Ally] Wow.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.003
Damn, this is--
this is totally [bleep].

16:45.070 --> 16:46.538
Hey, we got some Jager!

16:46.605 --> 16:48.307
-[Ally] What?
-[man] Are you kidding me?

16:48.374 --> 16:50.409
Can we say cheers
to everybody?

16:50.476 --> 16:52.911
-To a good competition.
-Good competition.

-This is badass.
-Wow.

This is happening.

Artists, come on in.
Gather around.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.111
Welcome to your first
elimination tattoo.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.646
In the elimination tattoos,

17:27.713 --> 17:30.449
you will be permanently
inking human canvases.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.185
This season,
it's even more important

17:33.252 --> 17:35.154
to make your
human canvas happy.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.855
After every elimination
tattoo,

17:36.922 --> 17:40.993
there will be
a human canvas jury.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.862
The human canvases will vote
on the one tattoo

17:43.929 --> 17:45.330
they think is the worst,

17:45.397 --> 17:48.534
and the verdict will put
one artist up for elimination.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.135
What?

17:50.202 --> 17:52.037
[Kyle] <i> It's a little scary,</i>
<i>even more than</i>

17:52.104 --> 17:55.274
{\an8}being voted to the bottom
by the judges.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.942
I don't want to be voted
to the bottom

17:57.009 --> 17:58.210
by the canvas jury.

17:58.277 --> 18:01.079
If you don't please your canvas,
you could go home.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.949
[Dave] This week, we are testing
your flexibility,

18:04.016 --> 18:07.419
and there is no better test
than a cover-up.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.587
[Joey whistles]

18:09.988 --> 18:11.423
{\an8}Cover-ups are super difficult.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.625
<i>We have to work</i>
<i>with what's there already,</i>

18:13.692 --> 18:16.128
we have to make it look like
there was nothing there

18:16.195 --> 18:17.229
in the first place.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.697
Let's meet your canvases.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.606
-[bleeps].
-No way.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.308
[Jackie] Wow.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.509
-[man] Come on.
-[Jackie] Oh...

18:30.576 --> 18:32.044
[Ally] <i> The inmates are the</i>
<i>people</i>

18:32.110 --> 18:34.880
{\an8}that we're gonna be doing
the cover-ups on.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.382
[Frank] <i> Holy [bleep].</i>
<i>These guys are in prison.</i>

18:37.449 --> 18:39.952
{\an8}What are they doing here?

18:40.018 --> 18:41.420
[Dave] You might recognize
these gentlemen.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.921
While they aren't
current inmates,

18:42.988 --> 18:46.592
most have served
hard time.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.762
Canvases, please show us
the tattoos you want covered.

18:50.829 --> 18:54.099
[Maddie] <i> Cover-up?</i>
<i>That was the one thing</i>

18:54.166 --> 18:56.969
{\an8}that I was least
looking forward to.

18:57.035 --> 18:58.070
{\an8}And it's our first one.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.105
[Dave] Joey, you won
the Flash Challenge.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.007
You now have the power
to assign

19:02.074 --> 19:04.543
all the human canvases.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.678
[Joey] <i> I would say the top</i>
<i>competition in the house</i>

19:06.745 --> 19:08.013
<i>right now is Jime.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:09.314
{\an8}He's gonna be a threat
in this game.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.382
[Joey] What do you
want to get done?

19:10.449 --> 19:11.617
I have this on my chest

19:11.683 --> 19:15.354
I'd like covered with a
realistic, kick-ass lion.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.723
I want to get this
covered up with a dragon.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.358
[Jime] <i> The one canvas</i>
<i>that I don't want</i>

19:19.424 --> 19:21.426
{\an8}is the one canvas that
I had tattooed earlier.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.596
<i>It's got the biggest cover-up,</i>
<i>the darkest skin.</i>

19:24.663 --> 19:26.398
<i>None of the elements</i>
<i>that I want to be stuck with.</i>

19:26.465 --> 19:29.067
[Joey] So what I'm gonna do
is make this simple.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.636
I'm just gonna give you
the same artists

19:30.702 --> 19:32.671
as you had in
the Flash Challenge.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.641
-[bleep] off.
-No way!

19:35.707 --> 19:38.443
[bleep]. Joey just
[bleep] me big time on this one.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.313
Canvases, one by one,
please read the name

19:41.380 --> 19:44.516
on the bottom of your skull.
-Jason.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.184
Chris.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.053
-Ally.
-Right here.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.889
-Mystical Mike.
-I got you.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.724
Kyle.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.426
Craig.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.862
-Jackie.
-Rock and roll, man.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.097
-ES.
-You're in good hands.

19:59.164 --> 20:00.399
Joey.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.601
{\an8}My guy wants
a huge dragon tattoo.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.803
<i>There was other options</i>
<i>I could have easily had,</i>

20:04.870 --> 20:06.405
but I'm not here
to take the easy way out.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.507
-Tatu Baby.
-Hey.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.243
-Maddie la Belle.
-Hi.

20:12.110 --> 20:13.712
-Joshua.
-All right.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.515
Jime.

20:16.582 --> 20:17.849
{\an8}I just got screwed
on this one.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.018
<i>He wants a dragon.</i>
<i>That's the kiss of death.</i>

20:20.085 --> 20:22.654
<i>No one has ever walked</i>
<i>in front of any of the judges</i>

20:22.721 --> 20:24.623
<i>with a dragon and then said</i>
<i>anything nice about it.</i>

20:24.690 --> 20:26.425
That's almost like
pack your bags,

20:26.491 --> 20:27.492
go the [bleep] home now.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.562
-MADE Rich.
-Good work, bro.

20:30.629 --> 20:31.663
James.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.433
Frank.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.137
Remember, your human
canvases will be voting

20:39.204 --> 20:40.973
one of you to the bottom.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.374
You have the rest
of the evening

20:42.441 --> 20:44.409
to consult
with your human canvases.

20:44.476 --> 20:48.113
Tomorrow, you will have six
hours to complete your cover-up.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.548
Good luck.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.784
{\an8}Flexibility is everything
in a cover-up.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.920
<i>It's basically the artist's</i>
<i>ability to camouflage</i>

20:54.987 --> 20:58.123
what's already on the skin
to make it disappear.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.058
-So how you doing?
-I'm doing pretty good

21:00.125 --> 21:01.393
now that I'm out.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.795
I want to do
some type of dragon.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.231
I was even thinking the head,
like, down here,

21:06.298 --> 21:07.366
and his body up here.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.267
[Jime] <i> We have six hours</i>
<i>to do a tattoo,</i>

21:09.334 --> 21:10.535
{\an8}and he wants half
of his arm done.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.505
I was even thinking
throw some fire on this thing.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.173
{\an3}[Jime] <i> I'm worried as [bleep]</i>
<i>that I'm not gonna be able</i>

21:15.240 --> 21:16.475
to impress these judges.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.513
Listen, my expectations,
they weren't met.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.081
I'm really counting
on you on this.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.349
{\an8}I am livid.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.785
<i>Mystical Mike [bleep] up</i>
<i>my Flash tattoo,</i>

21:26.852 --> 21:29.588
<i>and I do not want him to do</i>
<i>my elimination tattoo.</i>

21:29.655 --> 21:32.524
I want a lion, but I want him,
like, roaring.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.394
I may not be able to do
everything you ask for.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.362
The point is to cover up
that tattoo.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.031
Actually, the point is
for me to walk away

21:39.097 --> 21:41.433
with something
that I'm happy with.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.669
If I don't get what I want,
I'm gonna be pissed.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.175
[dramatic music]

21:50.242 --> 21:52.544
[Maddie] If I have extra time,
I might make a big, like,

21:52.611 --> 21:54.246
mountain-type thing.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.782
<i>There's a lot riding</i>
<i>on this cover-up.</i>

21:56.848 --> 21:58.517
I can't be at the bottom
again.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.785
[Jime] Where's the cover-up
going in there?

21:59.851 --> 22:02.087
I don't know, like,
how, exactly,

22:02.154 --> 22:04.122
I want him to come out,
but...

22:04.189 --> 22:05.123
All right, cool.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.425
-Good luck with that.
-Thanks.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.460
Ah, I'm freakin' out.

22:08.527 --> 22:12.364
Artists, today you must
cover up a prison tattoo,

22:12.431 --> 22:13.532
proving your flexibility.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.934
You have six hours
to tattoo,

22:16.001 --> 22:18.870
and your time begins now.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.605
-Let's get it on.
-Let's do it, man.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.974
[Oliver] <i> Flexibility relates to</i>
<i>the cover-up challenge really</i>

22:23.041 --> 22:25.410
{\an8}well because you can't just do
exactly what you want.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.545
<i>Not only does the artist</i>
<i>have to design</i>

22:26.611 --> 22:28.213
<i>the tattoo the client wants,</i>

22:28.280 --> 22:31.016
they also have to make it fit
over the top of another design.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.217
That looks good.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.019
[Oliver] <i> We're definitely trying</i>
<i>to separate</i>

22:34.086 --> 22:35.087
the cream from the crap.

22:35.153 --> 22:39.091
[needle buzzing]

22:41.359 --> 22:43.729
[Maddie] <i> My canvas,</i>
<i>he wanted a dragon</i>

22:43.795 --> 22:45.397
<i>with a castle</i>
<i>in the background,</i>

22:45.464 --> 22:47.766
{\an8}very plain-looking.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.035
<i>I convinced him</i>
<i>to change the perspective.</i>

22:50.102 --> 22:52.571
Really push this design
to the next level.

22:52.637 --> 22:54.072
The castle is dope!

22:54.139 --> 22:55.974
The more you look at it,
the more you, like,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.443
find little [bleep], you know?
-[man] Definitely. Definitely.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.679
Boy, this is
some serious work.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.681
{\an8}I hate to be one to call out
the blatantly obvious,

23:02.748 --> 23:04.082
{\an8}but the perspective
on that castle

23:04.149 --> 23:06.718
<i>is way off compared to the</i>
<i>perspective to that dragon.</i>

23:06.785 --> 23:08.253
At least I know I'm not
gonna be

23:08.320 --> 23:09.354
in the bottom
of this competition.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.622
[needle buzzing]

23:10.689 --> 23:11.723
My client was very
unmovable

23:11.790 --> 23:13.425
when it came to his
tattoo design.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.594
<i>And I recommended</i>
<i>to use blues,</i>

23:15.660 --> 23:18.163
<i>which are a more dominant,</i>
<i>insistent pigment</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:19.231
to push over the cover-up

23:19.297 --> 23:20.999
and have more
of a successful result.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.935
Whose idea was it
to go all blue?

23:24.002 --> 23:25.070
It was mine.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.938
Monochromatic style is good
for a cover-up

23:27.005 --> 23:28.573
because you can just use
one color tone

23:28.640 --> 23:29.975
<i>to kind of hide</i>
<i>what's underneath there.</i>

23:30.041 --> 23:32.210
<i>But a lot of detail</i>
<i>is not there yet,</i>

23:32.277 --> 23:33.211
<i>and he's already coloring?</i>

23:33.278 --> 23:34.446
It's kind of backwards to me.

23:34.513 --> 23:37.983
What did I get
myself into? Heh.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.019
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.320
[Tatu Baby] <i> Coming here last</i>
<i>season,</i>

23:42.387 --> 23:44.022
{\an8}I already proved
that I'm a great artist.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.025
<i>This time around,</i>
<i>I have to win the $100,000.</i>

23:47.092 --> 23:48.560
You gonna win this thing
this time or what?

23:48.627 --> 23:50.428
I'm gonna do my best.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.230
[Chris] <i> Tatu Baby is doing</i>
<i>a nice tattoo,</i>

23:52.297 --> 23:54.833
{\an8}other than the fact that
the finger is not attached

23:54.900 --> 23:56.802
<i>to the hand</i>
<i>and it has arthritis.</i>

23:56.868 --> 24:00.539
{\an8}She spent a whole season
hearing that the fingers are

24:00.605 --> 24:01.773
<i>one of the most</i>
<i>important things.</i>

24:01.840 --> 24:03.575
Don't [bleep] 'em up.
She should know better.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.110
Three more hours to go.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.246
[needle buzzing]

24:09.381 --> 24:11.483
[man] This is a $100,000 tattoo.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.820
I sure [bleep]
believe so.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.488
[Joshua] <i> I'm planning on showing</i>
<i>flexibility in this tattoo</i>

24:16.555 --> 24:19.958
by squeezing in pretty much
an impossible area.

24:20.025 --> 24:21.226
We're just gonna go through
in detail

24:21.293 --> 24:22.294
every single little piece.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.328
I'm gonna make
this mother[bleep] sick.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.097
So I've got to really
pull it together

24:26.164 --> 24:27.265
and make this happen.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.367
-Yo, Mac!
-What's up?

24:29.434 --> 24:32.003
-Pass the tequila!
-[Mac laughs]

24:32.070 --> 24:34.472
That's definitely gonna get
in the way of my process.

24:34.539 --> 24:36.608
[Joshua] Yo, Rich,
control your canvas.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.144
Damn, I don't know how
you can concentrate.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.345
[Rich] You ought to be flexible.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.580
It's a challenge of flexibility.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.881
Yeah, exactly.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.250
{\an8}I really don't understand
why he's stressing so much.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.652
Mac, I don't hear you!

24:47.719 --> 24:48.887
[Joshua] Yeah, we hear you.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.422
Hey, thanks for making it
a relaxing environment.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.790
Seriously.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.692
<i>Rich is having a hard time</i>
<i>keeping his canvas quiet,</i>

24:53.758 --> 24:55.427

on my [bleep] nerves.

-Shut the [bleep] up.

-Having fun?

Don't hate me, dude.
We'll be friends

25:07.405 --> 25:09.341
when it's over, I promise you.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.611
Like it, man. I like it.

[Frank] <i> My canvas wants</i>
<i>a realistic baboon.</i>

25:25.924 --> 25:28.593
Why'd you have to pick something
with all that fur, man?

25:28.660 --> 25:31.062
I could be really shooting
myself in the foot here.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.864
What do you think
about this baboon thing?

25:32.931 --> 25:34.633
I can't even read
what it is.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.700
Look at that stencil.

25:35.767 --> 25:38.270
I mean, this outline
is chaotic.

25:53.785 --> 25:56.554
three, two, one.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.958
That is it, people.
Time's up, machines down.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.193
-[Dave] No more ink.
-We're done, dude.

26:02.260 --> 26:05.830
Oh, man, this is more
than what I expected.

26:05.897 --> 26:09.367
I was really,
really nervous, man.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.539
Seems like the whole front
of the dragon's darker.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.274
I didn't get to do
a lot of the shading

26:16.341 --> 26:17.642
that I would have liked.

26:17.709 --> 26:21.513
At this point I'm just
beating myself up.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.614
[Jime] <i> When it comes to Maddie's</i>
<i>tattoo,</i>

26:22.681 --> 26:25.050
{\an8}you can totally see
the cover-up still.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.118
<i>I didn't think she really</i>
<i>used her time wisely.</i>

26:27.185 --> 26:29.020
Someone's packing their [bleep]
and going home.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.855
I can't look at that
anymore.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.660
{\an8}[Joshua] Are you here to learn,

26:35.727 --> 26:37.329
{\an8}or are you here to be
the [bleep] Ink Master?

26:37.395 --> 26:39.631
-I respect your critique.
-It's not personal.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.433
No one is saying
I had to add teeth.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.702
No, nobody's saying you have
to do a good tattoo at all.

26:46.604 --> 26:48.206
[rock music]

26:51.576 --> 26:53.078
I always like trying
new things.

26:53.144 --> 26:54.279
-Nice.
-That was my first time

26:54.346 --> 26:55.580
doing a biomechanical.

26:55.647 --> 26:56.915
I kinda just tried
to push myself.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.783
I'm not really here
to play it safe, you know.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.785
[Joshua] I personally would not
do that.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.887
I really feel like
Rich did make a mistake

27:02.954 --> 27:05.256
trying something new, and going
with the biomechanical.

27:05.323 --> 27:06.858
He should have talked his client
into something else.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.327
Do you guys have any opinion
about that at all?

27:09.394 --> 27:10.795
He's not trippin'
on it.

27:10.862 --> 27:12.297
Josh, he's kind of
a douchebag.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.365
He's gonna be a problem.

27:13.431 --> 27:14.933
I'm just really interested
in the fact

27:15.000 --> 27:16.935
that you had the balls
to step up into something

27:17.002 --> 27:18.003
you have never done.
-Why not, though?

27:18.069 --> 27:19.471
To be an Ink Master,
you gotta be able

27:19.537 --> 27:20.572
to look at any style,

27:20.638 --> 27:21.673
whether
you've done it before or not...

27:21.740 --> 27:22.774
-Yeah.
-...and try and do it.

27:22.841 --> 27:23.942
[Joshua] There's a big
difference between

27:24.009 --> 27:26.845
trying something new,
and learning.

27:26.911 --> 27:28.346
[James] <i> Joshua came here</i>
<i>with a game plan.</i>

27:28.413 --> 27:29.614
<i>He's an instigator.</i>

27:29.681 --> 27:30.982
{\an8}I'm not playing this game
with some girl

27:31.049 --> 27:33.385
{\an8}in some high school
locker room.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.452
Are you guys here to learn,

27:34.519 --> 27:35.687
or are you here
to be the Ink Master?

27:35.754 --> 27:37.288
You can't be Ink Master
if you only do one thing.

27:37.355 --> 27:38.490
Are you here to learn,

27:38.556 --> 27:40.492
or are you here to be
the [bleep] Ink Master?

27:43.828 --> 27:45.897
[rock music]

27:57.609 --> 27:59.878
This week, we tested
your flexibility

27:59.944 --> 28:02.747
by asking you to cover
prison tattoos.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.616
Joey, let's start with you.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.320
You won the tattoo of the day
in the Flash Challenge.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.322
Do you think that
your canvas selection

28:11.389 --> 28:12.624
put you in the top?

28:12.690 --> 28:14.626
[Joey] I picked out a harder
tattoo to do, actually.

28:14.692 --> 28:16.127
I'm not here to take
the easy way out.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.129
There's no definition
to the tattoo.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.131
You have the same texture
everywhere.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.466
[Joey] You don't see
any texture in there

28:21.533 --> 28:22.600
on the front claw?

28:22.667 --> 28:24.502
Dude, I see the same texture
from the horn

28:24.569 --> 28:26.905
to the claw to the belly.

28:26.971 --> 28:27.906
I definitely think
there's different textures--

28:27.972 --> 28:29.474
Not really.
Literally,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.709
it's all the same color.
Everything's the same.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.945
It's one big red thing.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.516
Kyle.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.654
You did a good job
covering the tattoo,

28:42.720 --> 28:45.990
but your details aren't sharp,
your lines are a little weak.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.892
You fell short
on those elements.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.062
Craig.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.165
My client wanted
a badass eagle man.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.935
[Chris] What happens in this
tattoo for me is that it's flat.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.770
These colors aren't popping
as hard as they could

28:58.837 --> 29:00.004
because there's no black.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.873
Had you have put black,

29:01.940 --> 29:03.408
it would look
that much more dynamic.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.544
You have the ability to do
a really tough-looking tattoo,

29:06.611 --> 29:07.846
and you obviously can draw.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.214
You have a winning combination.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.249
You've gotta put it to practice.

29:12.617 --> 29:13.685
Jime.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.488
Were you happy
with your cover-up?

29:16.554 --> 29:17.822
Part of the challenge
is being flexible.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.225
For what I had to do,
I think I did good.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.093
[Chris] You did achieve
the cover-up.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.295
The white-- that was the thing
that threw me for a loop.

29:24.362 --> 29:26.865
To pump this much white in
there, most of the time,

29:26.931 --> 29:29.467
this will turn into almost
a keloid-looking result.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.636
I tried to get rid of
all that heavy black area

29:31.703 --> 29:33.505
'cause I didn't want it
to look like a giant eight ball.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.173
[Oliver] A year down the road,
it will not have

29:35.240 --> 29:37.342
this same brilliance
it has today.

29:37.408 --> 29:38.610
People need to understand
that that's not what

29:38.676 --> 29:40.979
they're gonna have
for the rest of their life.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.248
ES.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.950
Talk to me.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.585
[Oliver] The things I think you
lost on this tattoo

29:47.652 --> 29:48.853
are the fine details.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.255
I feel like you could have
brought the details out

29:50.321 --> 29:52.290
in the mouth and the eyes
a little bit better.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.892
I just wish those
were stronger

29:53.958 --> 29:55.960
to make this thing
look crisp.

29:57.028 --> 29:59.664
Jackie.
What's your confidence level?

29:59.731 --> 30:01.199
[Jackie] I'm definitely
confident.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.168
It's bright, it's colorful,
it covers it up.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.103
The tattoo isn't vibrant
and dynamic

30:05.170 --> 30:06.304
like you're thinking it is.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.073
The tattoo looks like
it healed ten years ago,

30:09.140 --> 30:10.642
and this is what was left.

30:11.576 --> 30:12.877
[Jackie imitating gunshot]

30:12.944 --> 30:13.945
James Danger.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.413
Talkin' about the cover-up.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.982
Very little use of black
in this tattoo.

30:18.049 --> 30:20.185
With my past experience
of seeing tattoos heal,

30:20.251 --> 30:22.287
I feel like that's gonna
show through.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.155
This is not gonna take you
to the end.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.891
Jason.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.560
[Chris] I'm just not a fan
of the top, man.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.895
That whole biomechanical area,
the texture

30:30.962 --> 30:33.731
and the things that make
biomechanical cool,

30:33.798 --> 30:35.133
that's not in this.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.302
Ally.

30:37.368 --> 30:38.903
[Oliver] You accomplished the
deal of covering it up,

30:38.970 --> 30:40.905
but from across the room,
it just looks like

30:40.972 --> 30:43.308
a really large,
orange football.

30:44.475 --> 30:46.110
Chris.

30:46.177 --> 30:49.047
The design-- there's some
wonky things about this thing.

30:49.113 --> 30:51.349
How many random people
out of ten

30:51.416 --> 30:53.318
would say that's
a koala bear?

30:53.384 --> 30:55.420
You could have done a drawing
that captured those qualities

30:55.486 --> 30:57.755
of a koala bear--
you lost it on that.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.460
Frank.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.163
[Oliver] This is a rough one,
man.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.464
[Frank] I tried to go
a little bit ballsy.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.066
I knew there was gonna be
a lot of detail.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.602
But the detail--
this does not translate.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.070
If you just saw the tongue,

31:12.136 --> 31:13.471
you're not gonna know
that's a tongue.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.543
[Chris] There's not one clean
bit of outline anywhere.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.545
You showed me everything
you can't do.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.947
Don't do things
to point out your weaknesses.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.183
Do things to point out
your strengths.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.087
Maddie.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.357
How do you feel
about what you did here?

31:32.423 --> 31:35.893
[Maddie] For doing a dragon,
thought I did pretty wall.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.095
The towers are way off.

31:37.161 --> 31:38.997
The right side of the castle
is taking a left.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.131
I did it on purpose.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.000
If you put this stencil
on the skin

31:42.066 --> 31:43.301
and looked at those
two towers

31:43.368 --> 31:45.236
and said, "Let's do this,"
that's not right.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.171
The area where
the cover-up is

31:47.238 --> 31:51.175
is so much darker than any
of the rest of this tattoo.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.810
I feel like you kind of
missed the mark.

31:57.682 --> 31:58.716
Joshua.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.253
It was a tough tattoo
to cover.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.122
Part of the things
that make it so hard

32:04.188 --> 32:07.125
is its closeness to the other
tattoos that he has.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.559
I mean, it is edge to edge.

32:08.626 --> 32:11.095
I don't like how
it comes in contact

32:11.162 --> 32:12.263
with the other tattoos.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.198
The fact that it just disappears
into his armpit,

32:14.265 --> 32:16.734
this tattoo is just
a beatdown for me, man.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.169
A beatdown?

32:19.404 --> 32:21.506
Rich.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.807
[Oliver] My big complaint
on this tattoo

32:22.874 --> 32:23.941
is the teeth of the skull.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.343
They're just kind of
nonexistent.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.178
[Rich] No one's saying I had
to add teeth.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.746
No, nobody's saying
you have to do anything.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.683
Nobody's saying you have to
do a good tattoo at all.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.386
Tatu Baby.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.990
You got an easy cover-up,

32:39.057 --> 32:41.225
and you did
a very beautiful tattoo.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.762
But this hand is crazy.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.564
There's no way
that one finger

32:46.631 --> 32:48.499
could be attached
to the same hand

32:48.566 --> 32:50.568
that the other fingers
are coming from.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.769
[Tatu Baby] I mean, now that you
pointed it out,

32:51.836 --> 32:52.937
I think you're right.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.439
If you get down to the last
couple of people,

32:54.505 --> 32:56.574
that finger could
send you home.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.609
[Chris] You've got a lot to live
up to in this competition,

32:58.676 --> 33:00.778
but you're gonna give a lot
of people a hard time.

33:00.845 --> 33:01.913
So let the battle begin.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.283
Mike.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.520
My problem with this tattoo
is it lacks any tight details.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.589
You didn't put any kind
of definition

33:11.656 --> 33:13.658
on the bridge of the nose
to bring the shape

33:13.725 --> 33:14.826
of this lion out.

33:14.892 --> 33:15.927
[Chris] This guy doesn't even
have whiskers

33:15.993 --> 33:17.462
on his right side of his face.

33:17.528 --> 33:19.330
It looks like somebody
stole your liner.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.332
You have no outline
on this thing.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.500
I don't know if anyone
noticed, I only had

33:22.567 --> 33:24.268
one machine to work with
for the whole tattoo.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.205
-You only had one machine?
-That's all I had.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.006
Wait, I'm lost.
I'm completely confused.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.209
-You have one tattoo machine?
-I don't ever leave my house

33:31.275 --> 33:33.211
without eight machines, minimum.

33:33.277 --> 33:35.313
How would you come
to a tattoo competition

33:35.380 --> 33:37.882
with a machine?
That's insane.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.350
Get yourself
more than one machine,

33:39.417 --> 33:40.351
and you might actually
be able

33:40.418 --> 33:42.387
to come back next season
and win.

33:50.094 --> 33:52.230
[Oliver] If I was coming on to
be a contestant on this show,

33:52.296 --> 33:55.500
I would show up
with every single piece--

33:55.566 --> 33:57.101
I got the best compliment
of my career from that guy.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.803
He said the two happiest moments
in his life

33:58.870 --> 34:01.105
were to see his kids born,
and to get tattooed by me here.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.140
[Chris] That's awesome.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.608
No, I mean,
I respect your critique,

34:03.674 --> 34:04.942
but I also know
what I was able to do

34:05.009 --> 34:06.210
with the time I was given.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.980
It's not personal.
This is all business.

34:09.045 --> 34:10.214
For 15 of you,
you'll be back,

34:10.281 --> 34:11.549
and one of you is packing.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.219
The human canvas jury is
deliberating right now.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.121
The verdict will put one artist
up for elimination.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.857
Head back to the loft
and we'll call you back

34:19.924 --> 34:21.359
when we've made a decision.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.868
That was [bleep] really stupid
that you only brought one.

34:30.935 --> 34:32.469
[Mike] <i> I came to this</i>
<i>competition with all the</i>

34:32.536 --> 34:34.071
<i>machines I was able to bring.</i>

34:34.138 --> 34:35.239
{\an8}There was a part of my life
when my machines

34:35.306 --> 34:36.507
{\an8}got thrown out the window.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.009
[Joshua] You should not have
told the judges that.

34:38.074 --> 34:39.911
[Mike] Yeah, now I know better
to keep my mouth shut.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.078
Right. Well, you didn't.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.346
Throw somebody else
under the bus.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.815
Don't just sit there
and take it up the [bleep].

34:43.880 --> 34:45.416
I mean, there's no crying
in tattooing,

34:45.483 --> 34:47.284
and everybody should be
fighting to the death.

34:47.351 --> 34:48.585
This is a competition.

34:51.355 --> 34:52.824
[pensive music]

34:54.992 --> 34:56.828
All right, gentlemen,
flexibility on the table.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.830
I swear, at the top,
I was pretty impressed

34:58.896 --> 34:59.964
with Jime's cover-up.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.632
[Oliver] It's a technically
sound tattoo,

35:01.699 --> 35:03.301
and it's a good cover-up.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.769
As far as who showed
the most flexibility,

35:04.836 --> 35:08.306
you got Jime and you got Craig
doing bigger, harder cover-ups.

35:08.372 --> 35:09.841
[Chris] Craig's tattoo was
a shocker.

35:09.907 --> 35:12.176
[Oliver] It has a lot
of nice details in it.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.377
Tatu Baby.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.779
I think it's a beautiful
tattoo.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.280
You guys hammered her
pretty hard.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.015
[Oliver] Even with the
mis-anatomy of the hand,

35:18.082 --> 35:21.052
I think her tattoo is
super clean, technically sound.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.186
[Chris] Look at the vibrancy.

35:22.253 --> 35:24.689
Even the muted colors
are bright.

35:24.755 --> 35:27.458
[Dave] Mystical Mike.
As a client, I look at this,

35:27.525 --> 35:29.627
especially from a distance--
it looks good to me.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.863
[Chris] It's missing the
sharpness, the crispness.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.632
This tattoo just
misses the mark everywhere.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.834
Frank.
I guess it's a baboon.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.636
[Oliver] The details that he
tried to replicate

35:38.703 --> 35:40.071
just did not translate.

35:40.137 --> 35:43.474
It's just rough, man.
There's no saving this tattoo.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.076
[Dave] I would think that
Maddie's tattoo

35:45.142 --> 35:46.310
is definitely in the bottom.

35:46.377 --> 35:48.479
[Oliver] The cover-up area is
black as night,

35:48.546 --> 35:50.715
and the rest of the tattoo
is sketchy and gray.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.350
[Chris] And it's so off,
those castles.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.418
[Dave] She claims that was
an intentional move.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.620
They always do.

35:55.686 --> 35:57.388
"I meant for it to be
[bleep] up."

35:57.455 --> 35:58.890
[Dave] Well, I think we have
our decision.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.925
It'll be interesting to see
what the human canvas jury

36:00.992 --> 36:02.727
came up with.
-[Chris] I'm excited about that.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.896
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to finding out.

36:04.962 --> 36:05.730
{\an8}Look at that, dude.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.265
{\an8}That is super badass, dude.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.566
{\an8}His dragon's better
than mine.

36:08.633 --> 36:11.202
[man] Dude, that is bad
as hell, man.

36:12.603 --> 36:15.506
The basic thing to this
is to find the worst tattoo.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.475
Frank McManus--
who feels that that should be

36:17.542 --> 36:18.509
one at the bottom?

36:18.576 --> 36:20.678
That would be mine.
I was going for

36:20.745 --> 36:22.747
another pit bull,
more realistic.

36:22.813 --> 36:25.149
And then we ended up
doing a baboon.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.785
[man] It looks like a dead
baboon with a broken jaw.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.388
I believe you should have
closed his mouth

36:30.454 --> 36:32.323
and shown more
of the face.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.357
That might be
the worst one.

36:33.424 --> 36:34.659
[Hiram] That's one of the
bottoms.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.427
Does anyone feel
that Maddie's tattoo

36:36.494 --> 36:38.429
should be on the bottom?
-Maddie was my artist.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.064
She wanted to redeem herself
from yesterday.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.166
[Hiram] To me, I see there's
no contrast

36:42.233 --> 36:43.568
between the castle
and the dragon.

36:43.634 --> 36:46.003
If she would have made
the dragon a different color--

36:46.070 --> 36:47.838
I wanted black and gray,
though, that's what I wanted.

36:47.905 --> 36:49.273
So then where'd the red
come from?

36:49.340 --> 36:50.408
[man] She hurt me, bro.

36:50.474 --> 36:52.543
My [bleep] is screaming
on fire.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.545
Her technique was not
up to par.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.814
So we got Frank,
and we have Maddie.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.417
Tatu Baby.
How many people believe

36:59.483 --> 37:00.685
Tatu Baby should go?

37:00.751 --> 37:02.587
My tattoo artist
was Tatu Baby.

37:02.653 --> 37:05.156
I wanted something to represent
the gypsy lifestyle.

37:05.222 --> 37:07.725
That finger, man-- where's
that finger coming from, man?

37:07.792 --> 37:09.827
The hair is great,
but when you go down lower

37:09.894 --> 37:12.029
with the finger, it just
throws me off, man.

37:12.096 --> 37:15.032
We all agree?
I think it's unanimous.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.167
We agree.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.738
[door opens, shuts]

37:23.107 --> 37:24.542
All right, we're gonna need
to see four of you

37:24.609 --> 37:28.512
down in the shop--
Baby, Frank,

37:28.579 --> 37:31.882
Maddie, and Mike.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.851
See y'all down there
in a minute.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.188
-All right, guys.
-Okay.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.289
[James] Good luck.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.125
[pensive music]

37:47.331 --> 37:48.866
Today we tested
your flexibility

37:48.933 --> 37:52.003
by asking you to cover up
prison tattoos.

37:52.069 --> 37:55.172
One of you made
a solid first impression.

37:55.239 --> 37:58.275
The judges have decided that
the best tattoo of the day...

38:06.450 --> 38:08.619
...goes to Tatu Baby.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.321
[Oliver] Even with the
mis-anatomy of the hand,

38:10.388 --> 38:11.489
you did a very beautiful tattoo.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.859
Smooth shading, nice color.
Really good job.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.060
Thank you.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.864
Frank, Maddie, Mike,
you are all in the bottom,

38:19.930 --> 38:22.967
and one of you will be
getting a death sentence.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.171
Maddie, you're here because
the human canvas jury

38:27.238 --> 38:30.274
determined that you had
the worst tattoo of the day.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.910
Wow.
[chuckles]

38:32.977 --> 38:35.179
[Chris] That's basically
a non-tattooing eye

38:35.246 --> 38:36.347
calling you out.

38:37.415 --> 38:38.716
I think my design
was great.

38:38.783 --> 38:40.751
[Chris] Why do you have an erect
tower and a leaning tower?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.953
It's like it's back here,
like, turned to the side.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.855
No, it's jacked.
It's not right.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.590
If I would have done
a portrait, I could have sho--

38:46.657 --> 38:47.925
I'm a portrait girl.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.127
But you could have done a
portrait of a castle right here.

38:50.194 --> 38:51.328
I-- I...

38:51.395 --> 38:53.831
I just hope I can show you
I've got tons more.

38:55.032 --> 38:55.933
Frank.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.568
You didn't get any
of the textures,

38:57.635 --> 38:59.570
from the hair to the mouth
to the teeth.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.205
[Frank] I really dug the mouth,
man.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.607
[Chris] When you match up the
technical aspects of tattooing,

39:03.674 --> 39:06.010
like line, shade, color,

39:06.077 --> 39:07.678
we're missing everything
to judge.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.447
I don't think
all the shading's bad on that.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.248
I think there are
some really solid parts

39:11.315 --> 39:13.084
that I really dig.

39:14.018 --> 39:14.885
Mike.

39:14.952 --> 39:17.121
You've got so much
heavy black

39:17.188 --> 39:18.622
in parts of this,
but I don't feel like

39:18.689 --> 39:19.924
you have it
in the right spots.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.126
I never thought I'd hear
more black was bad.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.895
To pontificate
on my other competitors,

39:24.962 --> 39:26.630
at least my piece
didn't need braces.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.865
The baboon's teeth
kind of looked like

39:27.932 --> 39:29.400
it was a bear trap,
just all over the place.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.769
That's what they were
supposed to look like, though.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.370
[Mike] The castle's not in
an even perspective.

39:33.437 --> 39:34.505
Those buildings are off.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.140
At least I brought more
than one machine.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.308
Just sayin'.

39:37.374 --> 39:39.610
I guarantee after this day,
you'll see I have

39:39.677 --> 39:40.811
the cleanest lines
in this competition.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.647
All right, guys,
the judges have decided.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.951
[dramatic music]

39:51.922 --> 39:53.357
Frank...

39:53.424 --> 39:55.826
you do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.865
[Chris] There's not much in this
to compare

40:00.931 --> 40:02.133
to the other two people
that are

40:02.199 --> 40:03.367
in the bottom with you.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.237
You got outdone.

40:06.303 --> 40:09.006
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.979
[Frank] <i> It's really</i>
<i>disappointing going home first.</i>

40:15.045 --> 40:18.415
<i>I'm way more talented than</i>
<i>a lot of the other people here.</i>

40:18.482 --> 40:20.384
I think they made
the wrong call.

40:24.488 --> 40:27.424
[announcer] <i> On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master...

40:27.491 --> 40:28.859
I want it in my right
armpit.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.328
-Her what?
-[bleep].

40:31.395 --> 40:33.330
It's just [bleep] ridiculous.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.832
Do you have what it takes
to win this competition?

40:34.899 --> 40:36.700
I have what it takes
to enhance my life

40:36.767 --> 40:38.235
and the quality of my existence.
-To win!

40:38.302 --> 40:40.004
-[James] Dude, shut up.
-[Jackie] Mike, shut up.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.705
Shut the [bleep] up
before I put

40:41.772 --> 40:43.607
my [bleep] foot in your mouth!

40:43.674 --> 40:45.876
If you can't get
this [bleep] in solid,

40:45.943 --> 40:47.077
you're not gonna make it.

40:47.144 --> 40:48.579
There's nothing to judge,
and that's a problem.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.047
You are [bleep] out.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.315
Come on,
take a [bleep] swing.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.884
Y'all better get
this mother[bleep] right now!

40:56.187 --> 40:58.489
[rock music]

41:26.984 --> 41:28.219
{\an8}[man] Original.
