- [laughing] No.

16:46.367 --> 16:49.600
- But not really.
[all laugh]

16:49.633 --> 16:51.300
- Coming up.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.266
- I used to wear these
contraptions with my ex.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.400
- You mean a strap-on?
[laughter]

16:55.433 --> 16:57.367
- Oh, my God.

17:01.100 --> 17:01.433
[crickets chirping]

17:04.000 --> 17:05.400
- All right, this is where
you need to watch out

17:05.433 --> 17:06.666
for the ticks.
- No! Don't say that.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.700
- Stop!
- I have a phobia of ticks.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.532
- Oh, God.
- Whoa.

17:09.567 --> 17:10.633
- Don't scare her.
- Well,

17:10.666 --> 17:12.300
she should look out though.

17:12.333 --> 17:16.532
- Oh. Zika virus. Zika.
- Oh, my God.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.133
- I like being in the outdoors.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.400
I let--I let
you guys go in front,

17:20.433 --> 17:21.666
in case there's a snake.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.500
My husband
tries to scare me

17:23.532 --> 17:25.500
and tell me there's gonna be
bugs and all these things

17:25.532 --> 17:27.700
and I'm not gonna like it.
so I'm ready for this.

17:27.733 --> 17:31.700
I just don't like, you know,
furry spiders...

17:31.734 --> 17:33.233
and snakes.

17:33.266 --> 17:34.734
Or any kind of bug at all.

17:34.767 --> 17:37.533
[sticks clicking]

17:37.567 --> 17:39.400
- Teddi?
- What's that supposed to be?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.200
To scare the bears?

17:41.233 --> 17:42.500
- In case there's a bear,
you think that's

17:42.533 --> 17:43.767
gonna make it go away?
- You're crazy.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.467
Are there bears out
in Los Angeles?

17:45.500 --> 17:46.734
- Where else do you
think the bears live?

17:46.767 --> 17:48.567
- Kyle, I think
that calls them!

17:48.600 --> 17:51.166
- That is what calls them.
- It calls them, yes.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.667
- I have dirt in my toes.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.567
- Who's gonna rock climb?
- Let's do it.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.700
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

17:57.734 --> 17:59.266
- How are you?
- I'm well, and yourself?

17:59.300 --> 18:00.433
- I'm Denise.
- Hi, I'm Forrest.

18:00.467 --> 18:01.767
- Hi, Forrest.
Nice to meet you.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.500
- Nice to meet you.
Have you done this before?

18:03.533 --> 18:05.300
- I have not.
- Okay. This loop right here?

18:05.333 --> 18:06.500
Hold out near
your chest like that.

18:06.533 --> 18:07.700
I'm going to put
this around your leg.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.633
- Have you done this before?
- Uh-uh.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.433
- Oh, my God,
we gotta wear a contraption?

18:11.467 --> 18:13.033
- There's a little
red buzzer up there.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.567
- Yeah.
- Whoever hits their buzzer

18:14.600 --> 18:16.266
first, I guess.
- Oh, my God, we're racing?

18:16.300 --> 18:17.467
- Oh, we're racing?
- Yes.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.200
- Wait, wait, wait.
- On your marks,

18:19.233 --> 18:21.633
get set, go.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.333
- My money's on Teddi.
- Ah, sh--.

18:23.367 --> 18:24.734
- They're gonna race?
- I don't know, Dorit's,

18:24.767 --> 18:28.567
like, moving.
- This is higher than it looks.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.000
- Oh, my God.
- (BLEEP).

18:31.033 --> 18:32.533
- Oh god, (BLEEP).
- Oh, oh.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.533
- Careful.
- Dorit looks like Spiderman.

18:35.567 --> 18:39.200
I'm kinda shocked at how
fast she's coming up this wall.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.667
- Oh crap,
this is high.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.367
- I think Dorit is winning.
- I think so.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.333
- I'm last.
- You did it!

18:46.367 --> 18:49.633
Whoo! Big shout out Dorit!
- Wow,

18:49.667 --> 18:51.066
impressive Dorit.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.300
- Whoo!
- You wanna go again?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.300
- Oh (BLEEP) no.
[laughs]

18:55.333 --> 18:58.300
- Dorit kicked my butt
in rock climbing. There,

18:58.333 --> 18:59.633
I said it.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.734
- I used to wear
these contraptions with my ex.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.567
- What! Camille!
- That's why we're

19:03.600 --> 19:05.600
no longer together.
- You mean a strap-on?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.367
- Oh, my God.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.333
- Oh, my God.
- I know what I'm looking at.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.567
- My ex and I did some sexy,
kinky play.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.233
[laughs]

19:20.266 --> 19:23.600
This is what we
do for the people we love.

19:23.633 --> 19:27.300
- Oh, my God.
I'm scared. Okay.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.600
- Wait, Lisa, you gotta wait.

19:29.633 --> 19:31.000
- Oh.
- Hurry, catch up!

19:31.033 --> 19:32.500
- That's cheating!
Rinna cheated.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.100
- You look so good Rinna,

19:34.133 --> 19:37.333
you are just scaling that wall!
- I'm scared,

19:37.367 --> 19:38.600
I'm getting scared.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.467
I'm just excited
to go camping,

19:40.500 --> 19:41.767
but I don't like heights. Like,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.600
why would I climb a fake rock?

19:44.633 --> 19:47.433
- You can do it Kyle.
- Come on, Kyle, you can do it.

19:47.467 --> 19:50.367
- Ugh, this peer pressure
is ridiculous.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.633
- Rinna actually likes heights.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.633
- Oh, my goodness!
- You look like you

19:54.667 --> 19:56.433
belong up there.

19:56.467 --> 19:59.266
- I don't like the way the
fingers grip on these things.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.000
- You're almost there, Kyle.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.467
You're past the halfway mark.
- I know, but then I think

20:02.500 --> 20:04.300
about how high up I am...
- Don't, don't.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.533
- And I get scared.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.500
When I am up
high and I look down,

20:08.533 --> 20:11.533
my entire body goes numb.

20:11.567 --> 20:14.700
- Beautiful.
- Oh, wow.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.633
- Oh, my God.
I don't wanna do this.

20:19.667 --> 20:22.300
My legs are numb and tingly
all the way up to my tweeter.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.533
----ing hell,
I don't wanna go anymore.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.000
- Come on,
honey, you can do it.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.600
- I'm done.
- No, Kyle, you can do it.

20:26.633 --> 20:29.100
- No, no.
- Kyle, just go back

20:29.133 --> 20:30.700
and you'll drop down.
- No. I'm happy with my life.

20:30.734 --> 20:35.100
I like--I like everything
the way it is. No me gusta.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.633
- Erika.
- Ah! Erika.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.400
- Whoo!
[buzzer sounds]

20:40.433 --> 20:42.667
- She knows how to get down.
- Yeah!

20:42.700 --> 20:47.500
- (BLEEP) all y'all.
[laughter]

20:47.533 --> 20:51.066
I want a mother----ing
burnt-ass hot dog.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.400
- We have stuff
for toppings here.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.066
The chips can be combined.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.467
- Wait, help me get these
----ing potatoes off of there.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.633
- Ow. Ugh.
- Wait, that side--

21:08.667 --> 21:10.133
I'll burn myself.
- Okay.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.767
Don't get the towel in there.
- I know.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.367
- Oh, lookit, Camille has it.
Look it, Camille's got

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
a better thing.
- Wait.

21:15.433 --> 21:18.066
It's starting to catch
on fire.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.600
- Other than that,
we're good.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.000
- So, should I not cook these?
- No. Just do it.

21:22.033 --> 21:24.433
- You can cook them.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.533
- Spray, uh, oil or something?

21:26.567 --> 21:28.433
- Oh, these have oil on them.
- They do?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.567
What about the hamburgers?
- You don't need oil on those.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.700
- You don't?
- No.

21:31.734 --> 21:33.467
- Wow.
- I don't think so.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.767
- I was a vegetarian
up until a few months ago.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.734
I was actually a
vegetarian when I met Aaron

21:37.767 --> 21:40.100
and my daughter, Sami,
was absolutely

21:40.133 --> 21:42.066
----ing devastated
when she found out I ate meat.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.633
It looks very good.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.467
- I've been
trying to be vegan for,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.066
like, ten years and
then you just give up.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.767
- Does that upset you?
- Disappointed.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.533
- It's almost as if I started

21:53.567 --> 21:56.567
doing drugs or doing
something really awful.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.467
- You know what,
the olive oil was to dust the,

21:58.500 --> 22:00.066
no, not the burgers.
- No,

22:00.100 --> 22:01.166
you don't put it on here.
- Not on the burgers.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.700
- (BLEEP).
- Well, she said

22:02.734 --> 22:04.033
put it on the burgers.
- No, baby, on the grill,

22:04.066 --> 22:05.567
on the grill.
- Oh.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.400
- Why on the grill?
- Because you need to--

22:07.433 --> 22:08.667
they said you need to
put the olive oil on the grill

22:08.700 --> 22:10.400
otherwise it'll stick.
- Oh, oh, oh.

22:10.433 --> 22:13.166
- Is that plastic?
The plastic on the stove,

22:13.200 --> 22:16.467
no, no, no, no. Not a good
idea.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.100
- Put the corn on here too.

22:18.133 --> 22:21.767
- That's gonna melt it. Maybe
we shouldn't flip with that.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.633
- This is all
I have to flip it.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.533
- Can we please move this?
Step away from the grill.

22:26.567 --> 22:30.200
These girls do not belong
anywhere near fire. Okay?

22:30.233 --> 22:32.667
- Here we can close this
a little bit for the steaks.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.133
We wanna get it hotter.
- I don't like this.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.667
- I know the--it's not
for here, but it's all we have.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.166
- This is all we have?

22:38.200 --> 22:40.000
Remove yourself immediately,

22:40.033 --> 22:43.000
because you're gonna
kill somebody, if not yourself.

22:43.033 --> 22:46.633
- Thank God, Kyle! Ugh!
- Oh, thank you.

22:46.667 --> 22:51.700
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Are you kidding me?

22:51.734 --> 22:54.133
- What is going on?

22:54.166 --> 22:57.633
- Uh, it does not look good.
- No, you guys, no.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.567
No. Okay.
- You don't understand.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.467
I didn't get a chance
to get the olive oil

23:01.500 --> 23:03.667
and they already
had everything on there--

23:03.700 --> 23:07.066
- One, turn it down.
[all yelp]

23:07.100 --> 23:09.166
- Oh, God.
- Camille's fired

23:09.200 --> 23:11.233
from this job.
And that thing's burning up,

23:11.266 --> 23:12.600
you can't use the rubber.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.166
This is fine,
we got it.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.266
- We can totally
handle this guys.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.633
- You two,
go have a drink,

23:16.667 --> 23:18.100
play some beer pong.
- Thank you.

23:18.133 --> 23:19.433
- No, I got this.
- No, you guys are fired.

23:19.467 --> 23:21.200
- We are not fired.
- No,

23:21.233 --> 23:23.000
this corner is not gonna cook.
- It's better than nothing.

23:23.033 --> 23:24.266
- See, it's fine.
- No,

23:24.300 --> 23:25.734
we're not,
we're not closing it.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.500
- I know but
this--this is the raw--

23:27.533 --> 23:28.700
- You two--
- Okay.

23:28.734 --> 23:30.100
- Don't.
- All right we are

23:30.133 --> 23:31.533
----ing fired.
- Okay, bye.

23:31.567 --> 23:34.600
- Not cool.
Teddi, girlfriend.

23:34.633 --> 23:38.633
I know how to grill meat.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.166
- Camille, did you put
the thing on top of there?

23:42.200 --> 23:46.734
- I will rinse it off.
It's all my fault, of course.

23:50.333 --> 23:53.133
- Burgers are ready.
Here you go.

23:53.166 --> 23:57.133
- Thank you.

23:57.166 --> 24:00.300
- This looks so nice.
It's so cute.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.233
- Maybe they won't be so bad.
- Maybe they won't.

24:03.266 --> 24:05.633
- [laughs]
- Oh, my God,

24:05.667 --> 24:07.567
how quickly did that happen?

24:07.600 --> 24:10.066
Are you guys already eating?
- Yeah, we're starving. Sorry.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.300
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.600
- Lisa, have a hamburger
or hot dog.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.567
- Wow.
- Is it really nice up there?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.533
- Was it great?
- There's room for one more.

24:17.567 --> 24:20.166
- I'm--somebody should go.
- Somebody should go.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.767
- Is it all right?
- Yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.266
- You just take that up.
Have a couple of quick bites.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.700
- Just put that
back on the grill,

24:24.734 --> 24:27.166
don't worry.
- I'll be back.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.767
- Well, this is fun.
Camping like this.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.200
- I think it's quite nice.

24:30.233 --> 24:31.600
- And you're
getting married soon.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.166
- How're you feeling?
- I'm fine.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.734
I can't wait
to get married at this point.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.533
- So, Denise can't go?
- She's filming,

24:36.567 --> 24:38.066
she's doing a movie.
- Oh, she's in that movie.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.500
- She couldn't
change the dates.

24:39.533 --> 24:41.200
- Erika can't go.
- Erika can't,

24:41.233 --> 24:44.333
and has Lisa Vanderpump RSVPed?

24:44.367 --> 24:47.233
- She's not gonna come if
she doesn't--she didn't come

24:47.266 --> 24:49.000
to my bridal shower.

24:49.033 --> 24:52.066
What happened to Vanderpump?
She's not here.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.667
She's not coming?
- Obviously, not coming.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.166
- Ah.

everything that you can.

truthfully, Camille,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.367
if you really care,
don't text her.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.100
Pick up the phone
and call her and say,

25:08.133 --> 25:09.767
"I want you at my wedding," if
that's the truth

25:10.000 --> 25:12.200

she should be involved with.

This is your big day

should be there

26:15.000 --> 26:18.033

Just call me master fire lady.

You don't get a happy ending.

- Happy ending for women?

Aaron had never

26:39.200 --> 26:41.233

and we were on the hunt.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.000

- Yeah. No,

26:43.033 --> 26:44.133
I wanted him to have one.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.066

a massage with a happy ending?

26:49.100 --> 26:50.433
- Yeah.
- What?

26:50.467 --> 26:52.433
You wanted him to
have a happy ending?

26:52.467 --> 26:54.700

guy that I had ever been with

that never had one,
I'm like, you have to try it.

26:57.467 --> 26:59.166
- A happy ending,
just to confirm,

26:59.200 --> 27:00.266
is a hand job.
- Yeah,

27:00.300 --> 27:04.000
at the end of the massage.

27:04.033 --> 27:06.333
- You have a fetish!
- No, I don't have a fetish.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.367
He was the only
person that had never had one.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.000
- Only person you know.
- Erika, I need you--

- To--because he had never had

27:21.233 --> 27:23.400

- A jerkoff one?

27:23.433 --> 27:26.266

needed to understand--

27:30.433 --> 27:31.467

I'm just saying I'm not

27:31.500 --> 27:33.467

27:33.500 --> 27:35.533
I don't think I'd be considered
cool--

I don't know if that is cool.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.266
If anybody came near my
husband for a happy ending,

27:41.300 --> 27:43.000
they would lose an arm.

27:43.033 --> 27:45.467
And he would lose
a very important appendage.

to get a happy ending,

27:55.066 --> 27:59.133
he would have a happy
removal shortly after.

- It was very insightful.
- "For my age"?

33:18.400 --> 33:20.467
I mean, really?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.066
I hate when
people talk down to me.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.667
You feel good?
Talk down to me?

33:24.700 --> 33:26.033
All right.
- Who talked down to you?

33:26.066 --> 33:27.300
- You did.
- Me?

33:27.333 --> 33:28.767
- Because--
- I didn't say--

33:29.000 --> 33:30.533
I didn't talk down to you.
I just said that sometimes

33:30.567 --> 33:34.033
you insert yourself into a
conversation like after

33:34.066 --> 33:36.500
the night after PK said that.

33:36.533 --> 33:38.433
- But he didn't mean it that
way.

33:38.467 --> 33:40.500
- But the hard part is,
then he goes,

33:40.533 --> 33:42.500
"We're good.
Me and Ken are good.

33:42.533 --> 33:44.333
Me and Vanderpump are good."
- That doesn't matter.

33:44.367 --> 33:45.533
I'm not talking
about that right now Teddi.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.033
- But you're the
heart of that situation.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.066
- And do me a favor,
let me have a conversation

33:48.100 --> 33:50.100
with Kyle for two seconds.

33:50.133 --> 33:51.500
- And it upset Kyle,

33:51.533 --> 33:53.734
I thought like,
or upset Dorit.

33:53.767 --> 33:56.000
- Stick to the story line
and then we can--

33:56.033 --> 33:58.734
- Oh, you're talking
down to me now.

33:58.767 --> 34:00.700
- Well cause, I don't like when
you talk down to me saying,

34:00.734 --> 34:02.400
"You're young."
That's actually--

34:02.433 --> 34:03.567
- But you are.
- Very passive aggressive.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.300
- You're young.
No, it's not.

34:05.333 --> 34:06.667
- Yes, it is.
You don't need to preface it.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.600
We're all human beings but--
- Oh, my God.

34:08.632 --> 34:10.533
- I just said the other night
when they had their argument,

34:10.567 --> 34:12.467
you pushed yourself
into that conversation and

34:12.500 --> 34:14.033
I thought that was just
between the two of them,

34:14.065 --> 34:15.533
and that's how I feel.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.300
And you sat down with
Lisa and Ken and you said,

34:17.333 --> 34:18.766
"I know, because I
know everything cause I know,

34:19.000 --> 34:20.367
cause I know," and I was like--
- I didn't say

34:20.400 --> 34:21.567
I know everything.
I said I'm very direct.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.033
- "I know a lot."
- Did you say

34:23.065 --> 34:24.533
you're a know-it-all?
- No, I said--

34:24.567 --> 34:26.000
- I said she's a know-it-all.
I said that.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.567
I said that to her.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.300
I said I thought that
you putting yourself into

34:30.333 --> 34:32.065
the conversation
between the two of them,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.600
it was inappropriate.
- It was inappropriate.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.033
- That's what I said.

34:35.065 --> 34:36.367
'Cause Dorit came over

34:36.400 --> 34:37.400
to explain things to Kyle

34:37.433 --> 34:38.734
and then Teddi just jumped in.

34:38.766 --> 34:40.667
I just feel like
she's a bit of a know-it-all.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.433
- Why wouldn't
you say that to me, Camille,

34:42.467 --> 34:44.100
in the moment
when we were all sitting there?

34:44.132 --> 34:46.033
What I've noticed about you
is you like to talk out of

34:46.065 --> 34:48.065
the side of your mouth but the
second you're with somebody

34:48.100 --> 34:49.766
to their face, you back
down, and then you have

34:50.000 --> 34:55.433
a whole new story to play.
- Well, my face is right here.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.433
- Okay, have I said I know
this?

34:57.467 --> 34:59.567
No, I'm expressing my
opinion.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.100
- No, you told me she--
- You insinuate yourself

35:01.133 --> 35:02.600
a lot into conversations.
- It was a setup.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.033
- Go ahead.
What?

35:04.066 --> 35:05.700
- That you
thought it was a setup.

35:05.734 --> 35:07.567
- She thought--she comes
up with this conspiracy theory.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.000
You felt that it was--
- What, the Boy George blow out

35:10.033 --> 35:11.100
was a setup?
- Yeah.

35:11.133 --> 35:13.367
You had this
conspiracy about it.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.033
- That was really,
it was insensitive.

35:15.066 --> 35:17.033
- It was on purpose.

35:17.066 --> 35:19.500
It was to say you're worse
off than I am

35:19.533 --> 35:21.533
in this situation,
and that was the intention.

35:21.567 --> 35:24.100
- Teddi's getting a little
too big for her britches.

35:24.133 --> 35:26.100
She's always telling
us how much she knows.

35:26.133 --> 35:27.734
And if you know that much,
you don't have to tell

35:27.767 --> 35:30.066
everybody how much you know.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.533
You know,
here's the thing,

35:31.567 --> 35:33.600
it was created by
somebody else you guys.

35:33.633 --> 35:36.033
You know what,
you're right about that.

35:36.066 --> 35:40.734
The hurt, the original hurt,
stems from Lisa.

35:40.767 --> 35:44.533
And her problem--and it's
becoming this toxic wave

35:44.567 --> 35:47.667
that's taking over.
- What's like a toxic wave?

35:47.700 --> 35:50.166
- Lisa said it all
stems from this one person,

35:50.200 --> 35:51.767
I said who?
Lisa Vanderpump.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.400
And it's kind of bleeding
out and it keeps growing and

35:54.433 --> 35:55.767
getting bigger.
- But, well, that's why

35:56.000 --> 35:57.667
we can't let that happen.
- Stop it now. Listen.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.734
- We don't care about her,
she's choosing not to be here,

35:59.767 --> 36:01.500
fine,
we're moving on.

36:01.533 --> 36:04.600
- I am sensitive.
The day before I had a friend,

36:04.633 --> 36:06.433
that I believed--
a friend of mine--tell me

36:06.467 --> 36:08.100
she wants nothing
to do with me,

36:08.133 --> 36:10.500
we have no friendship,
I don't love you.

36:10.533 --> 36:12.100
I still wanna move forward,
honey.

36:12.133 --> 36:15.033
- With somebody that
you think's lying to you?

36:15.066 --> 36:16.567
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.533
- I love you.
- How can you say you love me?

36:18.567 --> 36:20.100
- Oh, I actually don't.

36:20.133 --> 36:21.734
- And then I
go into an evening,

36:21.767 --> 36:24.066
and I have you, and saying--
well I haven't met

36:24.100 --> 36:26.633
your friends--
- You know all my friends.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.133
I already know her friends--
- I don't know all

36:28.166 --> 36:29.700
your friends, I don't know
all your friends.

36:29.734 --> 36:31.433
- Well, maybe we're not
that good of friends.

36:31.467 --> 36:33.166
- Well great,
you just gave me a Lisa line.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.600
It was just like,
at that moment,

36:35.633 --> 36:37.000
oh, my God,
okay, you know what?

36:37.033 --> 36:38.500
- I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings.

36:38.533 --> 36:40.133
- I think-
- I didn't mean it like that.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.700
- Do we need to talk about
happy ----ing endings again?

36:41.734 --> 36:43.400
- No, yeah, we do.

36:43.433 --> 36:44.633
- Should we move
onward and upward and forward?

36:44.667 --> 36:46.166
- Give me some
more information, Denise.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.133
- I will.
- How am I not even drunk?

36:48.166 --> 36:49.667
How is that possible?
- Teddi,

36:49.700 --> 36:53.533
you're very drunk for your age.
[laughter]

36:53.567 --> 36:55.000
- Yeah, I just wanted
to let you know.

36:55.033 --> 36:56.467
- I don't care
how old my soul is.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.734
I'm not as old as any of y'all.

36:57.767 --> 37:00.500
[laughter]
- Well, that is the truth.

37:00.533 --> 37:03.100
And, you know,
the sad part of it all is

37:03.133 --> 37:06.000
I am now the oldest
in this ----ing group.

37:06.033 --> 37:08.133
- Well, you know what--
- Oh, you are?

37:08.166 --> 37:14.000
- I am the ----ing oldest
right now!

37:14.033 --> 37:15.533
- Coming up.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.166
- Denise, we wanna know if we
want to go

37:17.200 --> 37:20.467
to a happy ending place--
- How do you let them know?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.633
- That might do it.

37:25.500 --> 37:32.367
♪ ♪

37:47.333 --> 37:51.700
- Ah!
- Oh, not even start with me.

37:51.734 --> 37:55.166
Are you a nut or what?
- Obviously.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.066
- Oh, my God.
- Well, those are cozy pajamas.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.633
- I know those--
- Isn't that cute?

37:59.667 --> 38:01.066
- This is the good one,
for sh-- like this.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.700
- I have to say,
mine was really warm.

38:02.734 --> 38:06.400
- I had a dream that
you got Portia a squirrel.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.333
You put it on the floor,
just like you put

38:08.367 --> 38:09.734
the rat on the floor last
night.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.166
[laughter]

38:22.200 --> 38:23.367
[screams]

38:23.400 --> 38:25.333
Oh, they threw
that ----ing rat in!

38:25.367 --> 38:27.100
- I never got to
go to summer camp,

38:27.133 --> 38:30.000
so this is my summer camp.

38:30.033 --> 38:33.200
- Ah! Assholes.

38:33.233 --> 38:34.700
- What's this wrap hanging out?

38:34.734 --> 38:36.233
- Ah!

38:36.266 --> 38:38.233
You are never too old
for slumber parties

38:38.266 --> 38:40.467
and playing practical jokes
on each other.

38:40.500 --> 38:43.000
- This turned out to be fun.

38:43.033 --> 38:45.333
- We may have had
some little divots,

38:45.367 --> 38:47.300
but all in all I...
- It was really fun.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.767
- I had fun.
- Hello.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.233
- Hi.
Top of the morning.

38:51.266 --> 38:53.333
- Hi.
- This is lovely.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.767
- When it comes to Camille,
her antics,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.166
I'm used to them by now.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.000
If she likes you today,
she may dislike you tomorrow.

39:11.033 --> 39:13.367
I'm gonna go rinse off.
See you all in a bit.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.300
And I'm not really interested
in going down that rabbit hole.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.066
- I'm gonna eat
this pumpkin pie.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.500
Who doesn't want
pumpkin pie for breakfast?

39:30.533 --> 39:33.200
That's the
breakfast of champions, okay?

39:33.233 --> 39:36.200
- I'd like a piece of pie.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.400
- Love that you're having
pumpkin pie for breakfast.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.133
- So good.
- I just ate

39:46.166 --> 39:48.000
Cheese Whiz
and pumpkin pie for breakfast.

39:48.033 --> 39:50.000
I'm ready to go.
Let's get in the car,

39:50.033 --> 39:51.333
it's time to go home. The end.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.700
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh sh--, this is heavy.

39:57.734 --> 39:59.700
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:59.734 --> 40:02.133
- Like, don't ever
call me a diva, honey.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.300
I can carry all my bags.

40:08.166 --> 40:10.133
- Well, that was fun.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.767
- Denise, we wanna know if we
want to go

40:12.000 --> 40:13.767
to a happy ending place it--
- Oh ----ing hell.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.500
- Wait, wait, Denise,
this is not about you.

40:15.533 --> 40:17.233
We're doing research
for our own--

40:17.266 --> 40:18.467
- This is literally about women
- Do you want me

40:18.500 --> 40:20.467
to do some research for you?
- Yes.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.200
Because Dorit was up all night
and couldn't

40:22.233 --> 40:24.100
find one close to her house.
- [laughing]

40:24.133 --> 40:25.767
- There's not one-- [laughs]

40:26.000 --> 40:27.367
- Like,
how do you let them know?

40:27.400 --> 40:30.233
[laughter]
- That, that might do it.

40:30.266 --> 40:32.300
- All right,
I have a group announcement.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.367
We're all invited.
My show, Sunday. I know--

40:34.400 --> 40:36.100
- Yay.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.000
- I know you're getting
married, so that's cool.

40:38.033 --> 40:40.100
- And I'm leaving for Hawaii.
- I know you're filming.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.066
- So sorry. I'm so bummed
I'm gonna miss it.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.467
- The rest of you,
you're invited.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.033
Bring your husbands if you
want, if you don't want,

40:45.066 --> 40:48.033
it's great.
Globe Theater, downtown.

40:48.066 --> 40:49.734
Easy breezy.
Have a good time. All right.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.200
- Yay.
- Okay, we love it, love it.

40:51.233 --> 40:53.000
- Erika Jayne!
- Erika Jayne--well this,

40:53.033 --> 40:55.333
I gotta go metamorphosize.

40:55.367 --> 40:57.567
Let's get the (BLEEP)
up out of here.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
- I love when people say,

41:03.533 --> 41:05.166
"Don't listen to the haters,
Kyle,"

41:05.200 --> 41:06.300
and I'm like, where are
the--which ones?

41:06.333 --> 41:08.266
What did they say?

41:08.300 --> 41:11.166
You making fun of me?
On my Instagram?

41:11.200 --> 41:13.066
- I won't look
at those responses.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.200
- These kind of trips help
your relationships

41:15.233 --> 41:17.533
get to a deeper place.

41:17.567 --> 41:20.266
I have to say, though,
it has changed a bit.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.433
You know, with like J-Lo
and the Kardashians

41:22.467 --> 41:24.567
and like all--it's like, now,
it's like if you're fuller,

41:24.600 --> 41:26.433
it's different.
I'm like, "Oh, okay,

41:26.467 --> 41:28.400
well my butt looks big in this.
Yay."

41:28.433 --> 41:30.100
[laughter]

41:30.133 --> 41:32.133
- You're laughing,
maybe arguing a little,

41:32.166 --> 41:34.033
you're sharing things
you wouldn't normally share.

41:34.066 --> 41:36.300
You just get to a different
place in your friendship

41:36.333 --> 41:39.367
that you're not going to
get to at a cocktail party.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.633
My daughters don't feel
that pressure of being thin,

41:41.667 --> 41:44.166
like, that I felt growing up--
- Really?

41:44.200 --> 41:45.500
- Because the
body type has changed--yeah.

41:45.533 --> 41:47.400
- Yes.
- Well, that's great.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.166
- It used to be Marilyn Monroe,
that's what was sexy,

41:49.200 --> 41:50.633
and then they got super skinny.

41:50.667 --> 41:53.467
Kate Moss became--she came
and started the whole--

41:53.500 --> 41:55.233
- That's unrealistic.
- Heroin chic,

41:55.266 --> 41:58.000
waif-looking, you know?
- Horrible.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.467
My girls don't feel that.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.567
- You know, it's not
an easy time to grow up.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.100
Imagine being a teenager...

42:04.133 --> 42:06.100
- Teenager and having
to deal with it? Horrible.

42:06.133 --> 42:07.500
- And having to deal
with social media.

42:07.533 --> 42:10.600
Like, we had a mirror
to deal with, basically, right?

42:10.633 --> 42:14.000
- It's hard out there.
It is not easy.

42:14.033 --> 42:16.233
The pressure's a
lot to be perfect.

42:16.266 --> 42:19.133
Have my girls had
a rough time of it? Yes.

42:19.166 --> 42:22.533
- All I cared about was
the skinniness.

42:22.567 --> 42:24.133
It's hard, and I don't want
what happened to me

42:24.166 --> 42:26.567
to happen to other people.
- I know.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.433
Your image was in a mirror,
you saw yourself,

42:29.467 --> 42:32.133
and you judged yourself off
of that or your friends.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.400
- Yep.
- That's it.

42:33.433 --> 42:35.233
- That's it.
- All I've tried to do,

42:35.266 --> 42:38.233
more than anything,
is to teach my girls self-love

42:38.266 --> 42:40.333
and how to love yourself
no matter what.

42:40.367 --> 42:42.433
No matter how you look.

42:42.467 --> 42:44.333
- Do you think
women are more pressured,

42:44.367 --> 42:46.600
like, in LA and
Hollywood than anywhere else?

42:46.633 --> 42:48.600
- I don't know anymore.
- When I'm not

42:48.633 --> 42:51.300
taking care of myself,
it really takes away

42:51.333 --> 42:53.066
my motivation, my drive,
everything.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.467
- Yeah.
- I look at myself

42:54.500 --> 42:56.166
as an art project,

42:56.200 --> 43:00.133
and I'll create whatever
I want till I wanna stop.

43:00.166 --> 43:01.567
- I like that.

43:01.600 --> 43:06.667
- ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord,
kumbaya ♪

43:06.700 --> 43:10.233
- Okay, yeah.
all: ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord ♪

43:10.266 --> 43:13.133
♪ Kumbaya ♪

43:13.166 --> 43:15.567
- Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills."

43:15.600 --> 43:18.433
- You're gonna
love the kitchen.

43:18.467 --> 43:19.700
- Oh, I'm so excited.

43:19.734 --> 43:25.200
- Are you ready for this?
- Oh, my gosh.

43:25.233 --> 43:26.700
- I have to get going cause
I have to get to the airport.

43:26.734 --> 43:28.567
- Mom, why are you crying?

43:28.600 --> 43:30.333
- Because this is a big dance
and I feel bad

43:30.367 --> 43:32.166
that I'm not gonna be here
to see you leave.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.266
- I wish there
was a way I can help.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.567
If you were to
come to my wedding,

43:35.600 --> 43:37.200
which you know I would
love for you to be there,

43:37.233 --> 43:39.166
I would want you
to feel comfortable,

43:39.200 --> 43:41.400
so, will you come?

43:42.567 --> 43:45.633
- I mean it is packed.
- How fun right?

43:45.667 --> 43:47.266
It's packed.

43:49.333 --> 43:51.467
[mic squeals]

43:51.500 --> 43:54.500
[mic squeaks]

43:55.300 --> 43:58.133
- That's a disaster.
- (BLEEP).

43:58.166 --> 44:00.233
- She's ----ing
pissed off right now.
