00:01.566 --> 00:03.742
<i>Previously on "Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.829 --> 00:05.179
I think I have
a superpower!

00:05.266 --> 00:06.484
- How did you get in here?
- I glamoured him!

00:06.571 --> 00:08.051
No more glamouring
other vampires,

00:08.138 --> 00:09.748
and not a word about this
to anyone.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.012
Reginald can glamour
other vampires.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.361
That's impossible,
and you know it.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.450
Reginald, he's behind this.

00:15.537 --> 00:18.018
What happens
if I fail the Assessment?

00:18.105 --> 00:20.063
- You die.
- Need to contact Nikki.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.369
Nikki brings death
and destruction

00:21.456 --> 00:22.761
wherever she travels.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.158
Maybe you could help me train.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.682
I have a problem

00:30.769 --> 00:34.164
that requires
your special touch.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.171
Hold the doors.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.002
Thanks.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.351
No worries.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.224
Floor?

00:50.311 --> 00:51.616
Yours.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.979
You're cute.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.633
I'm happy to be
whatever you want me to be.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.984
Anything?

01:13.812 --> 01:15.510
Surprise me.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.772
Surprise!

01:23.605 --> 01:25.085
Thanks for the room, lover.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.610
I think I'm gonna like it here.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.227
I don't understand
the point of this exercise.

01:37.314 --> 01:40.143
Visualize, believe, achieve.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.015
Or, conversely,
I could buy a big hammer.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.930
When do I get to hit it?
- Focus.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.541
Your body's an instrument.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.195
To use it properly,
you need to be aware

01:48.282 --> 01:49.805
of what's happening to
and within it

01:49.892 --> 01:51.676
at all times.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.113
Let's try the Power Breath
Protocol again.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.071
But all that did
was make me feel dizzy.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.421
Reggie, come on.
30 quick breaths.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.510
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.469
Then take a deep breath
and exhale.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.732
Hold it until you need
to breathe in again.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.865
Why are you helping me?
- I want you to live.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.824
That's good to know.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.608
What do you want?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.306
- Sarah.
- Okay.

02:12.393 --> 02:15.091
Keep her in mind
every time we train.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.659
Everything you do,
you do for her.

02:17.746 --> 02:20.096
For example,
Power Breath Protocol.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.576
Okay.

02:25.188 --> 02:28.322
Have you heard from Maurice?
- No. You?

02:28.409 --> 02:30.237
No.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.108
How did you two meet?

02:32.195 --> 02:34.850
- I met Maurice in Ibiza.
- Cool, that's fashionable.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.982
It's a feeding ground.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.420
The best kind.
- Oh?

02:39.507 --> 02:42.336
We hunted together,
fed together.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.903
When I heard he put up
here in Akron, I dropped in.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.601
Because you've always
wanted to see

02:46.688 --> 02:48.559
the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?
- That's in Cleveland.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.952
And the Wu-Tang Clan
deserve to be in it.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.217
Vampires nest.
It's what we do.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.914
Not too many of our kind
live alone.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.308
Maybe it's because
time passes so slowly

02:58.395 --> 03:00.267
and there's so much of it.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.746
What if you have
a girlfriend?

03:01.833 --> 03:03.226
Vampires don't have girlfriends.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.836
Well, maybe I'll be
the first one to do that.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.100
Maybe you will.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.711
Did you think
about what I asked you

03:09.798 --> 03:12.104
about leaving town
before the Assessment?

03:12.192 --> 03:15.325
I've been staring at
a cinder block all afternoon,

03:15.412 --> 03:16.805
and now you want me
to run and hide?

03:16.892 --> 03:18.502
I want you to be safe.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.069
That's all.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.636
Now, come on.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.159
Okay.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.422
There you go.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.209
Whoa, easy now.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.384
Hang on.
There you go. Come on.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.042
How are you feeling?

03:37.129 --> 03:39.306
Never better.
Top of the world.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.916
You're looking a little pale.

03:41.003 --> 03:44.311
Oh, I feel tremendous.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.095
Well, in any case,
drink this

03:46.182 --> 03:48.532
and eat as many
of these as you can, okay?

03:48.619 --> 03:50.926
Vitamin C increases
your blood antioxidant levels

03:51.013 --> 03:52.623
by up to 30%.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.626
Oh. Sounds great.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.063
And maybe take
some of these iron pills too.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.457
I'm so sorry about this.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.893
This is the only way
I know how to survive.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.331
Oh, it's no worries, Reginald.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.941
I'm your huckleberry.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.995
Ugh.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.433
Whoo!

04:19.520 --> 04:22.349
Oh, that hit the spot.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.699
- Always glad to be of service.
- Hmm.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.701
So is there anything else
I can do for you today?

04:26.788 --> 04:29.617
Oh, Todd, you've done
more than enough already.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.575
Hey, I bet you can't guess
what I did.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.751
If you want me to, I will.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.058
I'll try a thousand guesses
if that's what it takes.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.147
That's okay.
Sarah and I went on a date.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.585
- No way.
- We did!

04:41.672 --> 04:43.457
Ah, that is excellent news.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.197
- Right?
- How did it go?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.331
Any time I spend with Sarah
is just amazing.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.290
- Like a dream come true.
- It is.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.944
This is nice.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.381
I feel like I don't really
get to talk

04:54.468 --> 04:56.818
to anyone about Sarah
besides Sarah.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.603
I mean, there's Maurice,
but he's still pretty dubious

04:59.690 --> 05:01.257
about the whole--
- Did you kiss her?

05:01.344 --> 05:02.954
- What?
- Man, if I was you--

05:03.041 --> 05:04.608
not that I ever could be,
that's just crazy talk.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.349
But if I was,

05:06.436 --> 05:07.742
I'd kiss her.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.526
She's very kissable.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.093
She is.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.965
So? Did you kiss her?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.445
No.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.447
But there has to be
an explanation for that.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.971
It's probably just because
I didn't find the right moment.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.191
Right?

05:22.278 --> 05:24.324
Shouldn't every moment
be the right moment for a kiss?

05:25.934 --> 05:27.152
Huh.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.373
You're right.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.333
You're absolutely right.
Every moment should.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.814
Whoa, we're late.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.514
Listen to me.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.299
You were never here,
and you never saw me today

05:43.386 --> 05:45.997
and gave me admittedly
great advice about kissing.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.217
Go now,
and take these doughnuts,

05:48.304 --> 05:49.566
because
it's the least I can do.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.411
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.500
I'll take
a Chocoholic Blast--

06:10.587 --> 06:12.284
With a pinch
of Tropical Coconut.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.895
Can you make it a dash
this time?

06:13.982 --> 06:15.026
I think I'm building up
a tolerance.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.550
A dash?

06:16.637 --> 06:17.855
It's, like, 1 1/2 pinches.

06:17.942 --> 06:21.119
Right,
standard American units.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.818
I could stick around
if you want, play some games.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.864
Gee, I wish you could,
but the Shack is slammed.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.300
And I'm tired.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.913
I didn't know
you people got tired.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.525
Anyone ever tell you
that's a very rude phrase

06:35.612 --> 06:36.831
to say to someone?

06:36.918 --> 06:38.441
If you don't wanna hang,
just say so.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.748
I'm not a kid. I can handle it.
- Tomorrow. Promise.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.969
I miss you too, okay?

07:01.725 --> 07:03.118
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.728
What are you doing?

07:04.815 --> 07:07.688
I mean,
I know what you're doing.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.472
Snack prep's
a calling and a duty.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.301
Hmm, back home,
we grew our own snacks.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.303
You can grow corn nuts?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.305
Not exactly.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.307
So no corn nuts?

07:18.394 --> 07:19.743
No corn chips?

07:19.830 --> 07:21.832
No puffed or popped corn
of any kind?

07:21.919 --> 07:23.921
Paying for it was unnecessary

07:24.008 --> 07:25.749
when you can make
your own treats.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.447
- Counterpoint.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.624
Corn is tasty
in all of its outward shapes,

07:30.711 --> 07:33.365
and it keeps us employed.
- Mm.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.893
Oh!
- I am so sorry.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.721
What were you--

07:40.808 --> 07:42.331
It was just a planned--
unplanned impulse.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.115
To headbutt me?

07:44.202 --> 07:46.640
Corn nut frenzy?
That's possible.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.381
In all its outward shapes.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.035
I'm--

07:54.038 --> 07:57.477
You have blood on your nose.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.479
Oh.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.482
Oh, it's nothing, seriously.
I'm--

08:05.920 --> 08:07.008
Okay?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.796
<i>♪ Call and respond for the

08:12.883 --> 08:15.407

08:40.650 --> 08:42.565
Hey, Reggie.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.088
Hi, Maurice.

08:46.482 --> 08:47.744
Gonna invite me in?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.486
I'm pretty sure
that's something

08:50.573 --> 08:52.619
they just made up on TV.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.708
You still got good manners, right?

08:54.795 --> 08:56.013
Yeah.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.591
So...

09:08.678 --> 09:09.984
where were you?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.421
I mean, were you gone?

09:12.508 --> 09:14.336
Not that I noticed
or marked the time,

09:14.423 --> 09:17.818
but I'm still pretty curious
about your whereabouts.

09:17.905 --> 09:18.906
Nowhere special.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.864
Oh, okay.

09:20.951 --> 09:21.996
That makes sense.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.087
But I gotta say,

09:26.174 --> 09:27.654
when I thought
you were gone for good...

09:29.786 --> 09:32.876
That was--that was
a big problem for me.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.095
You're right.

09:35.705 --> 09:36.706
I should have done better
by you.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.403
I will do better.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.884
I just--

09:40.971 --> 09:42.669
I don't know, I needed
some time to clear my head.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.106
I'm sorry too.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.805
Which assumes
you're sorry?

09:48.892 --> 09:50.894
Yeah.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.766
Yeah,
I shouldn't have gone there.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.246
Look, we can have a problem.
We just gotta talk it out.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.552
Yeah.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.729
Glamouring Penelope and LeBron

09:59.816 --> 10:02.036
may not have been
the best idea.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.386
No. No, it wasn't.

10:08.042 --> 10:11.480
So you wanna catch me up?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.003
What have you been up to
while I was away?

10:14.744 --> 10:18.879
Well, okay.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.707
I might become
the first vampire ever

10:20.794 --> 10:21.751
to have a girlfriend.

10:21.838 --> 10:22.839
That's a life goal.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.972
And hopefully
it'll involve

10:25.059 --> 10:27.975
a first kiss if I don't
headbutt Sarah again.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.454
Wait, you headbutted Sarah?

10:29.541 --> 10:32.153
- Not on purpose, but...
- I hope.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.243
And Mike has been training me

10:35.330 --> 10:37.375
with the whole
mind-body connection thing

10:37.462 --> 10:39.203
so I can break cinder blocks
with my bare hands.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.902
- Mike's training you.
- In your absence.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.165
And is Sarah still
the most important thing

10:44.252 --> 10:45.557
in your undead life?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.255
By a factor of infinity.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.996
And you know I'm still
not on board with that, right,

10:49.083 --> 10:52.042
you and Sarah?
- Oh, trust me, I remember.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.219
No more glamouring vampires?

10:55.306 --> 11:00.094
No, no, completely retired
from that scene.

11:00.181 --> 11:03.401
Well, would you mind
if I help Mike out

11:03.488 --> 11:04.751
with the training?

11:04.838 --> 11:07.362
Yeah, that would be great,
thank you.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.408
Oh.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.201
I really missed you
when you were away.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.602
I missed you too.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.484
<i>♪ Wasn't me that
keep 'em beatin' ♪</i>

11:42.571 --> 11:46.183
<i>♪ When I need it most ♪</i>

11:46.270 --> 11:48.490
<i>♪ Talkin' to you,
and you believed it ♪</i>

11:50.535 --> 11:53.495
Wow.

11:53.582 --> 11:57.542
Hey, what would you say

11:57.629 --> 12:02.547
if I asked you out
on another date?

12:02.634 --> 12:06.464
I would say, "Wow," and,
"It's about time you asked."

12:06.551 --> 12:08.205
That's exactly
what I was hoping you'd say.

12:08.292 --> 12:11.339
But maybe I pick
the place this time?

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
- You don't like my place?
- Oh, no, no.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.951
It was great.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.345
Up until the
projectile vomiting incident.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.302
It did not pair well
with the wine.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.869
Mm.

12:19.956 --> 12:23.873
All right, you pick.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.397
If I'm being honest, I don't
really care where we go.

12:26.484 --> 12:27.964
I just want to go with you.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.487
Aw.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.231
<i>♪ You believed it,
you should've known it ♪</i>

12:57.602 --> 12:58.865
Is that what I think it is?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.475
Don't touch anything.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.259
So it is.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.218
What in the world are you doing
with herb-of-the-cross?

13:04.305 --> 13:06.220
Prepare for the worst,

13:06.307 --> 13:07.917
hope for the best.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.441
Wise words to live by,
it's true.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.444
But this herb will rob
a vampire of all her power.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.619
Yeah.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.709
Yes, it will.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.856
Levi?
- Is that it?

13:35.162 --> 13:36.859
Come on, Sare-bear,
bring it in.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.516
Come here. Hey!

13:44.649 --> 13:46.347
What are--
what are you doing here?

13:46.434 --> 13:47.565
What do you think?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.132
I came here
to see my baby sister.

13:49.219 --> 13:52.614
Oh, well, great.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.007
I missed you.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.662
What's on your mind?

13:57.749 --> 14:00.448
Come on, you know I can tell.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.798
Levi, I'm not going back.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.321
Who said anything
about going back?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.890
- But--
- Look.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.979
You were always
smarter than me.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.416
So--so, no, just--

14:12.503 --> 14:14.288
It took me awhile, yeah,

14:14.375 --> 14:16.899
but I understand
why you left the church.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.771
You do?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.469
Yeah.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.818
Exact same reason I left.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.954
You're out?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.086
We've got
a lot of catching up to do.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.959
Come here.

14:38.094 --> 14:41.576
I--I promise
I'm gonna be better.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.099
I'm gonna be the brother
that you deserve,

14:43.186 --> 14:44.535
and we are gonna be
a family again.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.713
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.628
Me too, Sare-bear.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.719
You got a place?

14:54.806 --> 14:56.765
Oh, yeah, I got a room
in some flop.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.159
It's not too bad.
I got free local calls, cable.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.638
The pool's empty, but--

15:00.725 --> 15:03.032
Okay, you're not staying
at a motel.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.860
You're gonna stay with me.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.166
That's good.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.997
Hey, Reginald.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.001
You'll never guess who this is.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.649
<i>I'd like this handled
as quickly as possible.</i>

15:54.736 --> 15:58.174
Here's your target:
Reginald Andres.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.741
He's a vampire?

16:03.527 --> 16:04.964
Wonders never cease.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.186
Here. Prices have gone up
since last time.

16:12.710 --> 16:16.584
- Wow.
- Inflation gets us all.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.413
I've prepared the contract
in advance.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.459
Just fill in your package
selection and sign it.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.505
I'll fax it to the Council.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.943
Idiot.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.076
This job isn't sanctioned.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.385
Fun. It's a secret?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.953
I adore secrets.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.263
You'll be needing
this one, then.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.181
Well,
that is quite the markup.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.400
Unsanctioned kills are risky.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.620
But with higher prices
come the benefits.

16:52.707 --> 16:56.972
See, the gore level goes up
to seven bloody stakes.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.583
Council only allows three.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.282
Imagine living life
with so little imagination.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.892
I don't want him to suffer.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.981
I just want him dead.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.724
How's about
a little UV light torture

17:09.811 --> 17:12.509
or evisceration for half price?

17:12.596 --> 17:14.337
So you're upselling me now.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.078
Well, I did
come all this way

17:16.165 --> 17:17.340
to Akron.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.475
So no add-ons?
- No.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.743
I'll start as soon
as you transfer the deposit.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.788
No digital currencies, please.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.490
Oh, thanks for letting me use
your facilities.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.231
Bodies are such trouble.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.409
Do consider my special
on families.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.627
Good through
the end of the month.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.725
That woman is insane.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.902
That woman
is a stone-cold killer

17:57.989 --> 17:59.774
for over 300 years.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.474
And a killer
is just what I need.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.789
Welcome to Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.921
Sour Apple Scream. Thanks.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.405
You know what? Never mind.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.451
Is Reginald around?

18:24.538 --> 18:27.236
Yeah, Reginald's
in the break room.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.325
He's our employee of the month.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.197
Again.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.155
- Nice.
- Oh, excuse me, sir.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.811
You're actually--you're not
supposed to go back there.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.988
Hi, welcome to Slushy Shack.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.685
How may I help you?

18:47.561 --> 18:49.519
Reggie, I need a word.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.607
What?

18:52.566 --> 18:55.177
- Quick question.
- Okay.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.005
Let's talk about the holes
in Todd's neck.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.354
That's more
of a statement than it is a--

18:58.441 --> 19:00.617
- Feeding on Todd stops now.
- But--

19:00.704 --> 19:02.619
Todd is a human, okay,
not cattle.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.055
You can't just treat him
like that.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.796
- But what am I supposed to do?
- You hunt.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.755
I suck at night
stalking, okay?

19:07.842 --> 19:09.757
Like, I tried it.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.412
The whole sucking bit,
it's just not in my arsenal.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.587
When was the last time
you got out there?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.589
It's been a while.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.200
I've been on a hiatus.
- That's not how it works, man.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.115
I found a steady food source.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.509
It's convenient, close at hand.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.380
I don't understand why I can't
just keep doing it--

19:24.467 --> 19:27.601
Todd's a crutch.
Cut him loose.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.646
Fine, okay.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.127
I'll cut him loose.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.086
But what about, like, tomorrow

19:35.174 --> 19:37.001
or the next day
or the day after that?

19:37.088 --> 19:38.394
You don't need
to feed every day, okay?

19:38.481 --> 19:41.180
But when you get hungry,
you do like we do.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.922
You hunt.
- Okay, hunt it is.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.235
Uriel, protector most high

19:53.322 --> 19:54.758
against the descendants
of Cain,

19:54.845 --> 19:56.847
I pray thee grant me
the strength and wisdom

19:56.934 --> 19:58.762
to deliver my sister unto thee.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.373
She has strayed,

20:00.460 --> 20:01.896
turned her back on the fold,

20:01.983 --> 20:03.898
and sullied herself
among the unenlightened.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.944
Help me bring her home,

20:07.031 --> 20:09.208
where she can be cleansed
and sanctified

20:09.295 --> 20:11.166
in the warmth
of your purifying blood,

20:11.253 --> 20:13.386
that your light
may shine upon her forever.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.564
Your faithful servant, Levi.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.698
Yes, new high score.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.744
All right, all right,
step aside, rookie.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.661
Wait a sec.
Are you humoring me?

20:27.748 --> 20:29.315
What?

20:29.402 --> 20:30.533
Every time
I make a new high score,

20:30.620 --> 20:33.144
you beat it by 50 points exactly.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.842
The perks of walking
with the undead.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.061
We're excellent gamers.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.020
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.327
Fair is fair.
You need to turn me.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.111
Hilarious.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.896
Claire.

20:45.983 --> 20:46.854
Let me talk
before you say no.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.072
No.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.596
But I prepared a speech.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.815
- You are 12.
- You don't get it.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.121
This isn't about me
wanting to be

20:53.208 --> 20:54.514
a competitive arcade gamer.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.690
I need this.
- No one needs this.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.648
I'm gonna do you a favor
and forget that you asked.

20:58.735 --> 20:59.910
Please?

20:59.997 --> 21:01.564
I feel safer
when I'm around you.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.349
Maybe--maybe if I was like you,
I'd always feel safe.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.002
Claire.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.656
Forget your age.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.876
A nonstarter in and of itself.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.008
Do you remember the Assessment
I told you about?

21:11.095 --> 21:13.141
- Yeah.
- If I fail, I die.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.622
And anyone I turn dies with me.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.667
The Council is very serious
about their siring protocols.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.626
Okay, and that's really sad,
but if you win--

21:19.713 --> 21:21.149
I'm not having
this conversation.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.759
Fine.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.935
Wait.
Let me ride home with you.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.198
Don't bother, Reginald.
I can take care of myself.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.554
C-Claire?

21:52.136 --> 21:54.661
Subject Todd Sleator,
aka Just Todd,

21:54.748 --> 21:56.706
enters park at 3:04 p.m.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.798
Follow Todd
right to the vampire

22:01.885 --> 22:03.626
that haunts Rubber City.

22:19.642 --> 22:23.690
Subject Just Todd takes path
toward the northeast exit.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.039
21 p.m.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.041
Ooh!

22:27.128 --> 22:28.434
Appreciate the save.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.436
You have amazing reflexes.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.089
I love your outfit.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.961
It was Fanny's.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.529
She was a very naughty girl,
so I hads to punish her.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.444
Is Just Todd
being a naughty boy?

22:38.531 --> 22:40.489
You heard me?

22:40.576 --> 22:43.274
Don't be ashamed.
I have excellent hearing.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.103
And sounds always travel
farther in the woods.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.627
Don't you agree?

22:47.714 --> 22:49.455
Actually,
trees absorb sound energy,

22:49.542 --> 22:51.761
so the greater
the density of the forest,

22:51.848 --> 22:54.416
the greater amount
of energy absorbed.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.244
By the trees.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.115
Is Just Todd cheating on you?

22:58.202 --> 23:00.466
Does he need punishing?
- Oh.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.119
No, it's nothing like that.
We're not dating.

23:02.206 --> 23:05.035
He's not my type.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.820
Then why are you
stalking him?

23:06.907 --> 23:10.301
I'm not entirely comfortable
with that word.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.610
Consider me a concerned friend.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.177
He's fallen in
with a bad crowd,

23:16.264 --> 23:17.308
and I'm just trying to help.

23:19.310 --> 23:23.010
I wonder what it would be
like to have a friend like you.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.491
I'm sure if your friends
thought you were in trouble,

23:25.578 --> 23:27.188
they would do the same.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.626
I am the trouble.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.717
I--I don't believe that.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.066
It's true.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.201
Tell you what.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.030
If you ever find yourself
in trouble, you can come to me.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.772
I'll be your friend.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.252
But what if I don't want
any friends?

23:51.691 --> 23:53.606
We can talk about that later.
I gotta go.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.479
See you around?

24:16.019 --> 24:17.717
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.066
That's where you're wrong, man.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.547
Only you can control this
if you want to.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.463
Excuse me.
What's going on here?

24:24.550 --> 24:25.942
Listen to me.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.774
Drink.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.646
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

24:33.733 --> 24:36.953
You can't turn him.
- I'm not turning him. Watch.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.522
The blood we take can heal them
if we give it back, okay?

24:40.609 --> 24:42.393
And Todd won't turn
unless he dies

24:42.481 --> 24:44.178
with my blood in his system.

24:50.619 --> 24:53.492
You've been feeling
a bit under the weather lately.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.406
But you're all better now, okay?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.104
And tomorrow
you'll be your old self

24:57.191 --> 24:59.541
with no memory
of Reginald feeding on you.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.848
Ever. Go now.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.110
Forget.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.209
That well is dry, Reggie, okay?

25:15.296 --> 25:16.515
No more drinking from it.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.908
Okay.

25:20.388 --> 25:22.042
It's like you didn't listen
to a word I said

25:22.129 --> 25:24.044
about people and cattle.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.655
Look, I get it.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.788
The taste of blood, it's--

25:28.875 --> 25:30.267
it's pure bliss.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.182
I'm not judging you.
I'm concerned, okay?

25:32.269 --> 25:35.621
The impulses and tendencies
you had as a human

25:35.708 --> 25:38.928
are only gonna be intensified
by your new nature, okay?

25:39.015 --> 25:40.930
You keep going
at the rate you're going,

25:41.017 --> 25:43.454
and you're gonna kill somebody.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.239
You're feeding
because you want to,

25:45.326 --> 25:47.807
not because you need to.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.330
It's a craving born
in your mind,

25:49.417 --> 25:51.898
and that's where
you need to control it.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.640
Just rewrite whatever's
telling you blood is the answer

25:54.727 --> 25:57.947
with a more--I don't know--
positive solution.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.908
So you're suggesting

26:01.995 --> 26:05.172
cognitive behavioral therapy
for vampires?

26:05.259 --> 26:07.261
Dude, just listen
to your body, okay?

26:07.348 --> 26:09.393
Only feed
when it tells you to.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.832
All right.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.224
It's gonna be a struggle, man.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.139
I know that.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.967
But when you need me,

26:18.054 --> 26:19.142
I'll be here.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.320
Thank you, Maurice.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.062
I got you, man.

26:33.156 --> 26:36.203
I love killing zombies.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.248
Don't know why. I just do.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.947
Zombies aren't real.
They're just a story.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.470
I was like that once.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.341
Bullshit, you were.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.740
Okay, look.

26:51.827 --> 26:55.526
There's a house of horrors
in New Orleans.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.920
Part museum, part sideshow,

26:58.007 --> 27:00.662
but mostly just a dank basement

27:00.749 --> 27:02.882
filled with questionable taxidermy

27:02.969 --> 27:04.753
and doctored photos:

27:04.840 --> 27:07.147
bigfoot's footprint.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.584
But the main attraction

27:09.671 --> 27:11.717
was the real deal:

27:11.804 --> 27:13.849
a vampire,

27:13.936 --> 27:17.592
chained and starved,

27:17.679 --> 27:20.116
rotting from the inside out.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.164
That was what they came for.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.821
That was something...

27:30.736 --> 27:32.825
Special.

27:32.912 --> 27:36.089
Every day...

27:36.176 --> 27:37.481
I hoped to die.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.266
But death wouldn't come.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.618
People laughed

27:43.705 --> 27:45.185
and said I was a fake...

27:47.100 --> 27:49.972
That my pain and decay

27:50.059 --> 27:53.323
were just acting and makeup.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.939
But there was one thing
they couldn't figure out.

28:02.898 --> 28:06.815
It was the only part of
my torture that impressed them.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.997
How did they come up
with that smell?

28:18.261 --> 28:21.656
One day, a vampire stumbled
onto that house of horrors.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.572
A warrior.

28:27.053 --> 28:30.360
And she fed me
the heart of the man

28:30.447 --> 28:33.059
who starved and chained me.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.583
She took my pain away...

28:37.193 --> 28:39.543
And gave me back
my eternal life.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
Angela.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.640
When?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.991
About ten years
after you two split up.

28:52.078 --> 28:54.036
I made a promise that day,

28:54.123 --> 28:56.299
a vow I would always keep.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.176
I'm her spy.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.308
I spied on you.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.006
I told her
what Reginald can do,

29:07.093 --> 29:09.269
glamouring vampires.

29:09.356 --> 29:13.273
I had to tell you the truth,
all of it, before she did.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.623
She's gonna kill him, Maurice,

29:15.710 --> 29:17.364
before the Assessment.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.195
I couldn't let that happen.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.632
I couldn't let Reginald die.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.677
I couldn't let you die either.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.127
Thank you for telling me.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.745
Now get the----
out of my house,

29:50.832 --> 29:52.399
and don't come back.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.550
<i>♪ Go back in time ♪</i>

30:13.637 --> 30:16.902
<i>♪ To save you ♪</i>

30:16.989 --> 30:18.251
- Here you are.
- I'm gonna go.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.774
Gonna head out.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.907
What's your rush,
Regi-round?

30:21.994 --> 30:23.909
Oh, a date night.
You know, karaoke.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.172
So that spells disaster.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.696
Expanding my horizons, though,
so there's that.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.567
Gonna have to trade insults
later, all right?

30:30.654 --> 30:31.699
Rain check.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

30:38.532 --> 30:40.055
Your neck.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.665
What about my neck?

30:41.752 --> 30:44.538
You had a hole situation
going on there.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.061
Two of them.
You don't remember?

30:46.148 --> 30:48.716
- Remember what?
- The bloody holes in your--

30:48.803 --> 30:52.154
Oh, mercy,
of course you forgot.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.200
Just like Sarah.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.767
But who...

30:56.855 --> 30:59.422
Welcome to Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

30:59.509 --> 31:01.685
Sour Apple Scream.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.731
And is Reginald still here?

31:03.818 --> 31:05.864
Coming right up.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.475
No, he's not.
It's karaoke night.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.303
Yeah, I heard.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.960
Sour Apple Scream.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.570
Have we met before?

31:16.657 --> 31:19.660
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I'm practically a regular here.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.445
I don't know why,
but this feels like

31:22.532 --> 31:24.360
the very first time.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.189
Sour Apple?

31:27.276 --> 31:28.538
As if my life depended on it.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.559
Hey, Mr. Butterworth.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.779
I'm in sort of a hurry, so...

31:52.693 --> 31:54.477
What?

31:54.564 --> 31:57.654
Oh, sorry,
that's my brother's van.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.309
Yeah, sure,
I'll move it right away.

32:00.396 --> 32:01.789
No problem.

32:01.876 --> 32:02.921
Okay.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.121
What the hell, Levi?

33:17.256 --> 33:19.475
I hope you like Thai,

33:19.562 --> 33:21.086
'cause I--

33:24.263 --> 33:25.525
What the hell?
You went in my van?

33:25.612 --> 33:28.615
Right, Levi,
because that's the problem.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.617
You lied to me.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.880
You said you were out,
that we'd be a family again.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.229
We are a family.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.970
Oh, no.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.277
This is something else.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.975
A mattress with handcuffs
in the back?

33:41.062 --> 33:42.977
The--the handcuffs
were a last resort.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.153
I was never--
- Resorting to what?

33:45.240 --> 33:47.460
Okay, truth time.
Are you happy here?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.157
Really, in Akron?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.638
Yes, I am.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.032
This feels
like a place to start.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.991
And I'm just starting.
- Starting to what?

33:57.078 --> 33:59.167
I met someone.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.865
And it feels like it could be
something really special.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.911
You don't belong here.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.739
You had a year
to come to your senses.

34:05.826 --> 34:07.306
Well, time's up.
I'm taking you home.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.959
I am home.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.662
<i>This is not something
that you get to decide for me.</i>

34:15.749 --> 34:17.620
<i>Not anymore.</i>

34:17.707 --> 34:19.361
<i>I am not leaving.</i>

34:19.448 --> 34:20.667
<i>You're turning your back
on your faith.</i>

34:20.754 --> 34:22.277
<i>It was never my faith.</i>

34:22.364 --> 34:24.627
I didn't choose it.
- It chose you.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.020
You belong
with the Enlightened.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.022
Oh,---- the Enlightened!

34:40.469 --> 34:42.645
Hey, Reginald.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.125
Come on in.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.432
Am I early?

34:46.519 --> 34:48.608
No, no,
you are right on time.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.523
My brother was just leaving.

34:54.744 --> 34:55.832
Now.

34:59.227 --> 35:02.012
You want more time. Fine.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.492
But in the end,
you'll come home to us,

35:03.579 --> 35:04.928
where you belong.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.109
I'll be seeing you, Sare-bear.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.936
Listen to me.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.722
You're gonna get in your van
and drive home.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.377
Tell them that you tried
but failed to find Sarah

35:18.464 --> 35:20.292
because you didn't.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.511
Understand?
You were never here.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.432
Okay,
what kind of sorcery was that,

35:30.519 --> 35:31.607
and can you teach it to me?

35:31.694 --> 35:34.132
It was just...

35:34.219 --> 35:36.917
the power of positive thinking.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.572
It's a book that my nana
used to read to me.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.139
It's powerful stuff.

35:43.358 --> 35:46.361
Or he just probably didn't want
to fight in front of me.

35:46.448 --> 35:47.971
That's probably more likely.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.713
But how are--how are you?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.846
That was really brave of you,
standing up to him like that.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.717
Well, I don't know
what good it'll do.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.328
He'll be back.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.807
I don't know.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.200
He might surprise you.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.897
But forget
about your brother for now.

36:00.984 --> 36:02.160
Who?

36:04.771 --> 36:08.644
Tonight is about
one thing only:

36:08.731 --> 36:09.950
me and you.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.081
Are you ready for that?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.867
Oh, I'm ready.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.564
Whoa.

36:17.479 --> 36:18.698
Mm, oh.
- Oh, yeah.

36:18.785 --> 36:19.829
Get the door.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.578
Ooh!

36:29.665 --> 36:31.189
Cool.
- Oh, he showed up!

36:31.276 --> 36:32.755
Who?

36:32.842 --> 36:34.104
Maurice.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.845
Oh, are you two--

36:35.932 --> 36:37.717
- That's, like, my best friend.
- Oh.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.067
- Yeah.
- Okay. Nice.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.764
May you escort me
to our table?

36:41.851 --> 36:43.375
I may.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.557
I didn't think you'd show up.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.515
Hey. Oh, man.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.778
Worst part about karaoke
in my experience

36:55.865 --> 36:57.563
is listening to people
talk about what you missed

36:57.650 --> 36:58.868
the next day.

36:58.955 --> 37:01.175
No, I intend
to witness this firsthand.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.221
Oh, sorry.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.701
Sarah, this is Maurice.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.137
I know Maurice
from the Shack.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.704
Well, not officially.
- Well, now you do.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.230
Have you picked a song yet?

37:12.317 --> 37:13.796
Because we gotta
get them in early.

37:13.883 --> 37:17.017
No, sorry, actually,
I don't sing in public, so...

37:17.104 --> 37:18.714
Oh. Hmm.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.152
No, no, no, no.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.287
This one.
- That's my jam

37:26.374 --> 37:28.942
I know. You hum it
all the time on mop duty.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.422
You noticed that?

37:30.509 --> 37:32.902
I notice everything
about you.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.948
You love pizza,
slasher movies--

37:35.035 --> 37:36.602
especially the meta kind--

37:36.689 --> 37:38.734
the sound that Velcro makes
when you pull it apart,

37:38.821 --> 37:41.868
and your favorite slushy
is Pineapple Surprise.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.742
Okay, okay.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.004
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

37:53.793 --> 37:58.058
So you--you didn't expect
to see me here.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.364
Reginald
forgot to mention it.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.931
- You don't mind?
- No. You're his friend.

38:02.018 --> 38:03.237
I appreciate that.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.413
Not everyone would be
so understanding.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.197
Well,
they don't know Reginald.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.288
He's the best guy I ever met.
