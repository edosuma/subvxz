01:16.113 --> 01:19.742
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

01:28.559 --> 01:29.583
Private Miller...

01:29.760 --> 01:32.786
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

01:32.963 --> 01:35.007
We're going to ask
you several questions.

01:35.065 --> 01:36.089
How do you feel?

01:37.101 --> 01:38.500
Well, sir...

01:38.669 --> 01:40.398
...I feel like a...

01:41.305 --> 01:43.637
Like a slice of butter...

01:44.341 --> 01:50.211
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

01:52.816 --> 01:53.840
Yeah.

01:54.284 --> 01:57.378
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

01:57.988 --> 02:00.422
...what emotions do you feel?

02:07.364 --> 02:09.092
Okay, Private Miller?

02:12.736 --> 02:13.760
Is this normal?

02:13.937 --> 02:15.598
Okay, Private...

02:16.673 --> 02:18.538
Okay, Private Miller?

02:18.709 --> 02:20.301
Private Miller.

02:23.780 --> 02:25.338
Answer the question.

02:31.522 --> 02:32.648
This went out, sir.

02:32.823 --> 02:35.485
Can you torch me?

02:35.659 --> 02:37.251
We'll send someone in.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.589
Holy bejesus!

02:46.236 --> 02:49.137
Private Miller, answer the question.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.864
What was the question again, sir?

02:51.308 --> 02:55.472
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

02:55.812 --> 02:57.404
You know what problem I have...

02:57.581 --> 03:00.914
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

03:01.084 --> 03:04.451
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

03:04.621 --> 03:06.054
Where are the boobies?

03:06.223 --> 03:09.659
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

03:09.826 --> 03:13.023
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

03:13.197 --> 03:16.496
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know Item 9 exists?

03:16.667 --> 03:19.227
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

03:19.403 --> 03:23.897
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!"

03:24.074 --> 03:25.735
Private, we need you to be serious.

03:25.909 --> 03:29.640
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.479
That's inappropriate.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.784
Fuck you!

03:44.962 --> 03:48.625
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

03:48.799 --> 03:52.394
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

03:52.569 --> 03:53.866
This never happened.

03:54.037 --> 03:55.664
Dude, what happened to your eye?

03:56.306 --> 03:57.898
Hello.

03:58.942 --> 04:00.239
Can you guys understand me?

04:00.410 --> 04:03.277
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

04:03.447 --> 04:06.211
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

04:06.717 --> 04:08.480
Illegal!

04:08.652 --> 04:09.676
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.</i>

04:10.287 --> 04:11.447
<i>Welcome to KRAD.</i>

04:11.622 --> 04:14.557
<i>You know, I think that last caller</i>
<i>had some undeniable points.</i>

04:14.725 --> 04:17.421
<i>Right now, we're gonna get</i>
<i>to the next caller, Dale Denton.</i>

04:17.594 --> 04:19.494
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

04:21.398 --> 04:22.990
- Here's my piece.
- <i>All right.</i>

04:23.166 --> 04:25.896
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

04:26.069 --> 04:29.163
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

04:29.339 --> 04:31.170
Everyone likes smoking weed.

04:31.341 --> 04:34.777
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

04:34.945 --> 04:37.106
<i>It makes everything better. Makes</i>
<i>food better. Makes music better.</i>

04:37.281 --> 04:39.579
<i>It makes sex feel better,</i>
<i>for God's sakes.</i>

04:39.750 --> 04:42.617
<i>It makes shitty movies better,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

04:51.528 --> 04:53.894
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

04:54.064 --> 04:55.088
Yeah.

04:55.265 --> 04:59.895
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

05:00.070 --> 05:01.332
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

05:01.505 --> 05:03.700
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

05:05.008 --> 05:07.670
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

05:07.844 --> 05:10.335
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

05:10.514 --> 05:13.074
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

05:13.250 --> 05:16.447
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

05:16.620 --> 05:18.588
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

05:18.755 --> 05:20.154
I'm dating a high-school girl.

05:20.324 --> 05:24.055
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.</i>
<i>Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

05:24.227 --> 05:27.594
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

05:27.764 --> 05:29.823
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.094
- <i>Hey, as long as it's consensual.</i>
- I think it's consensual.

05:34.438 --> 05:36.235
Yo, you been served.

05:36.406 --> 05:39.842
You've been served.
You've been served.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.069
You've been served.

05:49.386 --> 05:51.149
Walter Wadska the third.

05:51.321 --> 05:53.687
You here to fix the fax machine?

05:53.857 --> 05:57.088
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4088 bucks.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.626
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

06:05.635 --> 06:08.661
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

06:13.944 --> 06:18.074
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

06:18.248 --> 06:22.446
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

06:33.864 --> 06:36.492
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

06:36.666 --> 06:39.157
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

06:39.336 --> 06:41.395
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

06:41.571 --> 06:44.131
And now because of that,
you've been served.

06:44.307 --> 06:45.365
You're a jerk.

06:45.542 --> 06:47.567
All this current system is doing...

06:47.744 --> 06:49.974
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

06:50.147 --> 06:53.844
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

06:54.017 --> 06:57.475
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

06:57.654 --> 06:59.645
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

06:59.823 --> 07:03.782
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks</i>
<i>for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

07:16.406 --> 07:18.203
I can't come.

07:19.075 --> 07:20.565
What?

07:21.411 --> 07:22.776
Why the fuck not, Dale?

07:22.946 --> 07:24.243
I just... Look, I can't come.

07:24.414 --> 07:27.178
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

07:27.350 --> 07:30.513
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When were you gonna tell me?

07:30.687 --> 07:32.211
My mom has been shopping all day.

07:32.389 --> 07:34.289
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.427
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

07:37.594 --> 07:39.585
- Now I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

07:39.763 --> 07:42.493
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.099
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

07:44.267 --> 07:45.734
Don't come. I don't care.

07:45.902 --> 07:49.201
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

07:49.372 --> 07:51.636
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

07:51.808 --> 07:55.403
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

07:55.579 --> 07:58.070
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.409
You're great, and you're funny...

08:00.584 --> 08:02.484
...and you're sexy.

08:02.886 --> 08:05.081
I just want them to see that.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.917
- You want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

08:08.091 --> 08:09.649
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

08:09.826 --> 08:11.817
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

08:11.995 --> 08:14.987
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

08:15.165 --> 08:18.134
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

08:19.369 --> 08:22.600
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

08:22.772 --> 08:24.103
What's that supposed to mean?

08:24.274 --> 08:27.903
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

08:28.078 --> 08:30.046
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

08:30.213 --> 08:31.771
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

08:31.948 --> 08:34.006
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

08:34.183 --> 08:36.948
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.746
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

08:38.922 --> 08:40.787
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

08:40.957 --> 08:43.517
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.185
I wish.

08:46.096 --> 08:47.927
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.623
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.165
Oh, yeah.

08:52.335 --> 08:53.768
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

08:53.937 --> 08:55.336
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

08:55.505 --> 08:56.972
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.199
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

08:59.376 --> 09:00.638
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

09:00.810 --> 09:02.277
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:02.445 --> 09:04.572
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

09:04.748 --> 09:06.978
- I mean, you're great. Yeah.
- Yeah, awesome.

09:07.150 --> 09:10.950
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.
Next year college, man. College.

09:11.121 --> 09:13.385
Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

09:13.557 --> 09:17.493
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

09:17.661 --> 09:19.561
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

09:19.729 --> 09:21.356
You got her ass? Perfect.

09:21.531 --> 09:24.398
- I'll watch her ass for...
- He's trying to be nice.

09:24.568 --> 09:26.661
- I'll catch you at Home Ec.
- Okay.

09:26.836 --> 09:28.963
You guys got Home Ec
together too. That's cool.

09:29.139 --> 09:31.403
- We got a few classes together.
- Nice to meet you.

09:31.575 --> 09:35.409
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm talking about. See you guys later.

09:35.579 --> 09:37.479
- All right, Clark.
- Clark's a great guy.

09:37.647 --> 09:39.706
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

09:39.883 --> 09:43.046
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

09:43.219 --> 09:45.483
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

09:45.655 --> 09:47.748
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

09:47.924 --> 09:50.188
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

09:50.360 --> 09:52.624
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

09:52.796 --> 09:55.560
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

09:55.732 --> 09:57.427
...or I call the liaison officer.

09:57.601 --> 10:00.729
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

10:00.904 --> 10:01.928
What a jerk.

10:02.105 --> 10:03.834
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

10:04.007 --> 10:07.033
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

10:07.210 --> 10:10.202
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.247
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

10:13.416 --> 10:15.316
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

10:15.485 --> 10:17.851
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

10:18.021 --> 10:19.750
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.754
That means so much to me
and my parents.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.917
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

10:26.129 --> 10:29.121
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

10:29.766 --> 10:32.291
- <i>Come on down.</i>
- Sweet. Be there.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.164
- <i>Hi, Mary.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

10:34.337 --> 10:36.931
<i>I thought the hurricane season</i>
<i>was over.</i>

10:37.107 --> 10:38.768
I thought hurricane season
was over.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.739
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Things just got out of hand.</i>

10:40.910 --> 10:43.276
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was</i>
<i>with my first husband.</i>

10:46.716 --> 10:48.149
Hello? Hey, man.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.081
What the fuck, man?

10:50.253 --> 10:52.881
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

10:53.056 --> 10:56.219
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when l...

10:56.393 --> 10:58.486
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

10:58.662 --> 11:00.289
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

11:00.463 --> 11:02.522
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

11:02.699 --> 11:06.157
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocol yet.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.600
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

11:08.772 --> 11:11.741
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

11:11.908 --> 11:13.899
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

11:14.077 --> 11:16.272
Yo, check this out.

11:18.615 --> 11:21.345
Satellite radio.

11:21.518 --> 11:24.487
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

11:24.654 --> 11:25.951
That's home entertainment.

11:26.122 --> 11:29.319
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

11:29.492 --> 11:31.619
Oh, yeah. Me and my <i>bubbe.</i>

11:32.095 --> 11:33.687
Hey, let me ask you something.

11:33.863 --> 11:35.194
Yeah?

11:36.099 --> 11:39.591
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

11:39.769 --> 11:41.828
Like, euthanasia?

11:43.973 --> 11:45.998
Like, on her?

11:46.176 --> 11:48.007
If I needed to.

11:52.682 --> 11:53.979
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

11:54.150 --> 11:56.812
I don't know if we should
start going down that road.

11:56.986 --> 11:59.955
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

12:00.123 --> 12:01.647
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

12:01.825 --> 12:04.157
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

12:04.327 --> 12:05.760
Business for the businessman.

12:05.929 --> 12:08.022
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

12:08.198 --> 12:09.631
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

12:09.799 --> 12:13.200
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:13.369 --> 12:15.234
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:15.405 --> 12:18.499
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

12:18.675 --> 12:23.339
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

12:23.513 --> 12:24.980
...and they had a baby.

12:25.148 --> 12:27.981
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

12:28.151 --> 12:31.814
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

12:31.988 --> 12:35.424
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

12:35.592 --> 12:38.823
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

12:38.995 --> 12:41.327
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

12:41.498 --> 12:42.795
- Smell it.
- Okay.

12:42.966 --> 12:45.264
Smell it. Enjoy.

12:45.435 --> 12:48.632
It's like God's vagina.

12:50.206 --> 12:51.605
What, you wanna bathe in it?

12:51.775 --> 12:53.675
- I wanna live in here.
- You wanna be it?

12:53.843 --> 12:56.971
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

12:57.147 --> 12:59.206
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

12:59.382 --> 13:00.679
Beautiful. What's it called?

13:00.850 --> 13:02.943
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

13:03.119 --> 13:05.110
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

13:05.288 --> 13:08.280
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.359
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

13:11.528 --> 13:13.860
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

13:14.030 --> 13:16.692
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

13:16.866 --> 13:18.424
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

13:18.601 --> 13:20.296
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.461
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

13:22.639 --> 13:23.970
Let me get my scale.

13:24.140 --> 13:27.541
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

13:28.645 --> 13:31.512
I thought hurricane season
was over.

13:32.415 --> 13:34.747
Oh, crow.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.887
Where are you, you little fucker?

13:41.291 --> 13:44.522
What the fuck is this thing?

13:45.762 --> 13:47.161
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

13:47.330 --> 13:49.696
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

13:49.866 --> 13:50.924
- Yeah, man.
- No.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.193
This is the future.

13:53.369 --> 13:58.170
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

13:58.341 --> 14:01.606
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

14:01.778 --> 14:04.338
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

14:04.514 --> 14:06.778
My second favorite civil engineer...

14:06.950 --> 14:10.818
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

14:10.987 --> 14:14.787
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

14:14.958 --> 14:18.223
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

14:18.394 --> 14:22.455
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

14:22.632 --> 14:25.863
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

14:26.035 --> 14:28.026
Future. The future.

14:28.204 --> 14:30.764
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

14:30.940 --> 14:33.841
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

14:34.510 --> 14:37.946
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

14:38.114 --> 14:39.877
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

14:40.049 --> 14:41.846
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

14:42.018 --> 14:44.145
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.049
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

14:46.222 --> 14:48.053
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

14:48.224 --> 14:50.351
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.460
I need your help, man.

14:54.063 --> 14:55.894
- I'm in.
- Come on!

14:56.065 --> 14:58.863
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

14:59.035 --> 15:00.900
Why not? What do I do?

15:01.070 --> 15:02.230
Okay, here's what you do.

15:02.405 --> 15:04.134
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

15:04.307 --> 15:05.706
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

15:06.643 --> 15:10.739
You are going to light these two ends
while I light this end.

15:10.914 --> 15:12.677
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

15:12.849 --> 15:15.716
- Ready.
- Blast off.

15:31.834 --> 15:34.428
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.978
It's better to cough.

15:48.151 --> 15:49.675
It's like...

15:49.852 --> 15:51.444
Makes you 10 times more higher...

15:51.621 --> 15:53.885
...than the cross weed
and the Pineapple Express.

15:54.057 --> 15:57.857
You're like,
totally fucking <i>Gong Show'ed,</i> man.

16:10.807 --> 16:12.206
Oh, fuck.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.842
Hang on one second, man.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.034
Oh, you fucker.

16:19.983 --> 16:21.211
Who is it?

16:21.384 --> 16:23.215
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

16:23.386 --> 16:24.580
Shit.

16:24.988 --> 16:26.319
What's a Gebert?

16:26.489 --> 16:28.081
Come on up.

16:28.257 --> 16:31.590
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

16:31.761 --> 16:36.130
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

16:38.034 --> 16:39.433
Hey.

16:39.602 --> 16:41.593
So listen, man.

16:41.771 --> 16:44.171
I gotta ask you. So...

16:44.340 --> 16:48.299
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, two months, right?

16:48.478 --> 16:50.776
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

16:50.947 --> 16:52.471
What's up with the suit?

16:52.648 --> 16:55.446
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

16:55.618 --> 16:59.987
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

17:00.156 --> 17:03.387
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

17:03.559 --> 17:06.618
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

17:06.796 --> 17:08.286
- I like...
- In process.

17:08.464 --> 17:10.432
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

17:10.599 --> 17:12.590
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

17:12.769 --> 17:14.896
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

17:15.070 --> 17:18.871
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

17:19.041 --> 17:21.306
...so I can serve them the papers.

17:21.477 --> 17:22.501
Disguise.

17:22.678 --> 17:23.804
Kind of, I guess.

17:23.980 --> 17:26.005
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

17:26.182 --> 17:30.346
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

17:30.520 --> 17:31.987
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

17:32.155 --> 17:34.646
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

17:34.824 --> 17:36.451
Nice.

17:36.626 --> 17:39.060
What? You sucked on her titties?

17:39.228 --> 17:42.288
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

17:42.465 --> 17:44.956
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

17:45.134 --> 17:47.227
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

17:47.403 --> 17:50.167
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

17:50.339 --> 17:52.170
She's cool as hell, actually.

17:52.341 --> 17:54.070
- You'd get along with her.
- Really?

17:54.243 --> 17:56.973
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

17:57.146 --> 18:00.877
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

18:01.050 --> 18:03.484
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

18:03.653 --> 18:06.520
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

18:06.689 --> 18:11.683
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

18:11.861 --> 18:14.056
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

18:14.230 --> 18:16.596
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

18:16.766 --> 18:19.462
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

18:19.635 --> 18:22.035
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

18:22.205 --> 18:24.332
You get to smoke weed all day.

18:24.507 --> 18:25.872
I wish I had that.

18:26.042 --> 18:29.375
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

18:29.545 --> 18:32.605
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

18:32.782 --> 18:35.250
You didn't think of that.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.477
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

18:37.653 --> 18:38.881
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

18:39.055 --> 18:40.682
Thank you.

18:40.857 --> 18:43.985
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

18:45.094 --> 18:46.959
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:47.130 --> 18:48.620
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.232
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

18:53.069 --> 18:54.593
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

18:54.770 --> 18:56.101
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

18:56.272 --> 18:57.569
All right, homes. Good.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.867
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

19:00.042 --> 19:02.010
You got the dough? There you go.

19:02.178 --> 19:04.305
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.873
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

19:07.049 --> 19:09.381
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

19:09.552 --> 19:10.576
- Chris.
- Chris.

19:10.753 --> 19:12.516
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

19:12.688 --> 19:15.179
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

19:15.358 --> 19:17.553
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

19:17.727 --> 19:19.627
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

19:19.795 --> 19:22.662
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.094
- Thank...
- God.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.258
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

19:26.435 --> 19:28.266
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

19:28.437 --> 19:29.802
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

19:29.972 --> 19:31.462
Fuck.

19:32.408 --> 19:34.205
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

19:34.377 --> 19:37.972
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

19:38.147 --> 19:40.843
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:41.017 --> 19:44.282
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

19:44.453 --> 19:46.512
...and process and service?

19:46.689 --> 19:49.214
I don't know. It's always
something different, I guess.

19:49.392 --> 19:50.654
This guy...

19:50.826 --> 19:53.522
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

19:53.696 --> 19:55.960
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

19:56.132 --> 19:59.932
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

20:00.102 --> 20:02.002
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

20:02.171 --> 20:03.195
That'd be weird.

20:03.372 --> 20:05.932
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

20:06.108 --> 20:09.635
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

20:09.812 --> 20:12.144
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

20:12.315 --> 20:14.943
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

20:15.117 --> 20:18.211
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

20:18.387 --> 20:21.515
That sounds appealing,
but you know what? I'll tell... Here...

20:21.691 --> 20:24.626
I'm gonna run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

20:24.794 --> 20:27.558
- We'll watch <i>227</i> and shit.
- Definitely.

20:27.730 --> 20:29.630
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

20:29.799 --> 20:30.959
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.623
One love.

20:33.135 --> 20:34.863
<i>When you got behind</i>
<i>on the mortgage...</i>

20:35.037 --> 20:36.834
<i>... someone finally</i>
<i>made you a loan?</i>

20:37.006 --> 20:38.098
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

20:38.274 --> 20:40.868
<i>Yes, he did.</i>
<i>What was the interest rate you got?</i>

20:41.043 --> 20:45.639
- <i>It was 12 or 13 percent.</i>
- <i>That's disgusting.</i>

20:55.324 --> 20:57.155
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

20:57.326 --> 20:58.953
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

20:59.128 --> 21:02.586
<i>I just talked to my mom, and they are</i>
<i>so excited you're coming for dinner.</i>

21:02.765 --> 21:05.893
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,</i>
<i>but we're all really excited.</i>

21:06.068 --> 21:07.092
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

21:07.270 --> 21:09.602
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

21:09.772 --> 21:13.435
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

21:14.910 --> 21:18.311
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait</i>
<i>for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

21:18.481 --> 21:21.382
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

21:21.550 --> 21:23.484
Fucking cops. Shit.

21:30.559 --> 21:32.390
Jesus.

21:37.066 --> 21:39.591
What an adorable little cop.

21:40.102 --> 21:41.694
Weird.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.099
Jesus. Fuck.

21:48.277 --> 21:50.302
What the fuck was that?

21:50.479 --> 21:51.741
Oh, shit.

21:52.815 --> 21:55.579
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

21:55.751 --> 21:56.775
Oh, no!

22:08.931 --> 22:11.923
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

22:12.101 --> 22:14.092
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.025
Pineapple Express.

22:47.970 --> 22:50.131
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:50.306 --> 22:51.796
I saw brains and blood!

22:51.974 --> 22:53.441
Come on! Come on!

22:53.609 --> 22:54.667
Where do I go?

23:11.093 --> 23:12.117
Hello?

23:12.294 --> 23:14.023
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

23:14.196 --> 23:16.664
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

23:16.832 --> 23:19.630
- <i>It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.</i>
- Dale?

23:19.802 --> 23:22.430
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.</i>
<i>It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

23:22.605 --> 23:24.664
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

23:28.677 --> 23:30.838
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

23:31.013 --> 23:32.844
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

23:33.015 --> 23:35.483
One, two...

23:35.651 --> 23:37.676
- Did it work?
- On three!

23:37.853 --> 23:40.686
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

23:40.856 --> 23:42.619
<i>Just on three.</i>

23:52.868 --> 23:55.200
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

23:55.371 --> 23:56.838
He fucking killed him.

23:57.006 --> 23:59.975
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

24:00.142 --> 24:03.236
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

24:03.412 --> 24:05.437
No, it was just a guy.

24:05.614 --> 24:07.275
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

24:07.450 --> 24:12.114
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

24:12.288 --> 24:15.280
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.016
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

24:17.193 --> 24:19.286
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

24:19.462 --> 24:21.191
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

24:21.363 --> 24:24.298
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

24:24.467 --> 24:25.900
What?

24:27.002 --> 24:29.368
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

24:29.538 --> 24:30.937
You threw up on my printer.

24:31.106 --> 24:32.471
- I did.
- Did you break it?

24:32.641 --> 24:34.541
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

24:34.710 --> 24:36.200
I think the guy was Ted.

24:36.378 --> 24:38.209
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

24:38.380 --> 24:40.314
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

24:40.483 --> 24:42.280
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

24:42.451 --> 24:44.112
What? They saw you?

24:44.286 --> 24:45.651
And you fucking came here?

24:45.821 --> 24:47.789
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

24:47.957 --> 24:52.223
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

24:53.762 --> 24:55.093
I saw them kill him.

24:55.264 --> 24:57.994
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

24:58.167 --> 25:00.294
I tossed my roach.

25:00.469 --> 25:02.937
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

25:03.105 --> 25:06.233
So they must have heard...
They know someone was out there.

25:06.408 --> 25:08.535
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

25:08.711 --> 25:11.339
They don't know it was you. Right?

25:11.514 --> 25:14.915
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

25:15.084 --> 25:16.642
- Yes.
- I hope not.

25:16.819 --> 25:17.877
Relax.

25:18.053 --> 25:22.820
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

25:25.294 --> 25:26.852
Is it really that rare?

25:27.296 --> 25:29.355
It's, like, the rarest.

25:30.332 --> 25:31.993
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

25:32.768 --> 25:36.135
It's like killing a unicorn...

25:36.305 --> 25:38.034
...with, like, a bomb.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.470
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

25:42.645 --> 25:44.772
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

25:44.947 --> 25:48.542
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

25:48.717 --> 25:51.777
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

25:51.954 --> 25:55.048
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

25:55.224 --> 25:57.021
And Red got this from Ted?

25:57.192 --> 25:58.523
Ted's the man.

25:59.228 --> 26:02.254
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

26:02.431 --> 26:04.763
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

26:04.934 --> 26:06.925
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

26:07.102 --> 26:10.503
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

26:10.673 --> 26:12.868
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

26:13.042 --> 26:15.135
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

26:15.311 --> 26:16.744
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

26:16.912 --> 26:19.710
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

26:19.882 --> 26:23.079
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

26:23.252 --> 26:25.345
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

26:44.406 --> 26:46.601
Red said he'd be here.

26:54.216 --> 26:56.548
Them some drugs.

26:58.721 --> 27:00.279
Smells like vomit in this house.

27:00.456 --> 27:02.356
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

27:02.524 --> 27:04.685
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.521
Smell it on my sweater.

27:06.695 --> 27:08.128
For real?

27:08.297 --> 27:09.594
Yeah, for real.

27:09.765 --> 27:12.563
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

27:12.735 --> 27:13.793
Not my style.

27:13.969 --> 27:16.335
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

27:16.505 --> 27:18.939
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voice mailbox of...</i>

27:19.108 --> 27:20.735
- <i>Ted.</i>
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

27:20.909 --> 27:23.707
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

27:25.247 --> 27:27.909
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew we were coming.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.209
They not here, Ted.

27:29.385 --> 27:31.080
Hi, Ted.

27:31.687 --> 27:33.951
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

27:34.123 --> 27:35.886
I think he's crazy about murdering.

27:36.058 --> 27:38.253
Well, that's not good.
Where are we gonna go?

27:38.427 --> 27:42.295
Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel
and just hide out.

27:42.464 --> 27:46.059
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

27:46.669 --> 27:50.230
Shit. I wish we could
just go nowhere.

27:52.408 --> 27:53.568
Okay.

27:53.742 --> 27:59.442
Even if he found that roach,
how could he know where you are?

28:00.916 --> 28:02.747
Heat-seeking missiles.

28:04.453 --> 28:05.579
Bloodhounds.

28:06.655 --> 28:08.179
Foxes.

28:08.357 --> 28:09.984
Barracudas.

28:10.159 --> 28:13.356
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's weird.

28:13.529 --> 28:14.553
Thank you.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.755
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

28:16.932 --> 28:18.866
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

28:19.034 --> 28:23.232
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

28:23.405 --> 28:26.738
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

28:26.909 --> 28:28.774
Only Red knows, man.

28:28.944 --> 28:30.377
Who is Red?

28:30.546 --> 28:34.209
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

28:34.383 --> 28:36.442
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

28:36.618 --> 28:38.711
One time, he got this girl...

28:38.887 --> 28:42.288
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

28:42.458 --> 28:47.020
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

28:47.396 --> 28:52.356
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

28:52.534 --> 28:54.661
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

28:54.837 --> 28:57.465
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

28:57.639 --> 29:00.335
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

29:00.509 --> 29:04.104
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

29:04.279 --> 29:08.113
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

29:08.283 --> 29:10.751
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

29:12.755 --> 29:16.521
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

29:17.326 --> 29:19.817
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

29:19.995 --> 29:23.954
You know? Just ignore what I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

29:24.133 --> 29:25.760
See what the dealio is.

29:29.471 --> 29:31.268
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

29:31.440 --> 29:34.534
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.</i>
<i>I just stubbed my toe.</i>

29:34.710 --> 29:37.702
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.906
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.574
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

29:43.752 --> 29:46.380
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

29:46.555 --> 29:47.852
I'd never talk to anyone...

29:48.023 --> 29:52.255
...about the stuff that I do with you
involving drugs.

29:52.427 --> 29:54.918
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.928
I gotta lay some shit on you.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.691
There is a fly in the ointment.

29:58.867 --> 30:01.427
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

30:01.603 --> 30:03.901
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

30:04.072 --> 30:06.563
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- <i>Perfect.</i>

30:06.742 --> 30:09.734
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

30:09.912 --> 30:12.380
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

30:12.548 --> 30:14.982
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

30:15.150 --> 30:16.174
- Who?
- I don't know.

30:16.351 --> 30:17.978
He's whispering to another man.

30:18.153 --> 30:20.986
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

30:21.156 --> 30:24.648
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

30:24.827 --> 30:27.227
- <i>Hey.</i>
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

30:27.396 --> 30:28.454
How'd you know that?

30:28.630 --> 30:32.498
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

30:32.668 --> 30:35.364
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

30:35.537 --> 30:38.267
...because my <i>bubbe...</i> Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.965
Is that the <i>bubbe</i>
that's on 41 st and River Street?

30:41.143 --> 30:43.543
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

30:43.712 --> 30:46.340
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

30:46.815 --> 30:49.613
- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- <i>Nice.</i>

30:49.785 --> 30:52.481
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

30:52.654 --> 30:55.316
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>
<i>We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

30:55.490 --> 30:58.755
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

31:02.464 --> 31:04.625
I should call Angie soon.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.826
Make up some bullshit.

31:08.003 --> 31:09.095
I'm cold.

31:09.271 --> 31:12.331
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

31:12.507 --> 31:13.531
I run hot.

31:13.709 --> 31:15.006
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:15.177 --> 31:18.476
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

31:18.647 --> 31:21.878
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

31:22.284 --> 31:24.275
I'm gonna call Angie.

31:30.893 --> 31:32.520
Space.

31:34.730 --> 31:36.129
Dale, wait. Wait.

31:37.432 --> 31:39.900
The phones. The phones.

31:40.068 --> 31:42.332
- You said they were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

31:42.504 --> 31:44.062
I was thinking, maybe they can...

31:44.239 --> 31:46.969
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

31:47.142 --> 31:49.042
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.076
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

31:51.246 --> 31:52.907
Maybe they can even trace them...

31:53.081 --> 31:55.515
...like, when we're not even
on them, you know?

31:55.684 --> 31:59.176
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

31:59.354 --> 32:01.322
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

32:01.490 --> 32:02.957
We'll never catch an animal.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.593
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

32:05.761 --> 32:07.353
No, no, no.

32:07.529 --> 32:09.895
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

32:10.065 --> 32:11.464
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:11.633 --> 32:13.032
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

32:13.201 --> 32:16.136
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

32:16.305 --> 32:18.500
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

32:20.175 --> 32:23.338
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

32:23.512 --> 32:25.707
- What tree?
- That one.

32:25.881 --> 32:28.406
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

32:28.583 --> 32:31.450
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.554
Did you at least see
where it landed?

32:33.722 --> 32:35.349
I don't know. Call it.

32:35.991 --> 32:39.222
Call it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

32:40.896 --> 32:43.023
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

32:43.198 --> 32:46.656
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

32:46.835 --> 32:49.429
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

32:49.604 --> 32:51.731
- Do you see it?
- See what?

32:51.907 --> 32:54.171
The phone, you idiot.

32:54.343 --> 32:57.107
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.577
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

32:59.748 --> 33:02.512
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

33:03.151 --> 33:04.675
- What?
- What was that?

33:04.853 --> 33:05.911
- What?
- What is that?

33:06.088 --> 33:08.989
- What?
- I hear something.

33:09.157 --> 33:10.181
What?

33:10.359 --> 33:12.224
I don't know. Do you hear that?

33:12.394 --> 33:14.760
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

33:15.664 --> 33:16.688
Oh, fuck!

33:16.865 --> 33:20.232
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

33:22.771 --> 33:23.795
Help me!

33:24.806 --> 33:26.296
Tell him to get away from me!

33:26.475 --> 33:28.670
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

33:28.844 --> 33:30.675
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

33:32.514 --> 33:34.482
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

33:34.649 --> 33:36.412
- Fall back!
- Save me!

33:49.264 --> 33:50.595
Oh, shit.

33:52.601 --> 33:53.625
Car.

34:02.044 --> 34:03.978
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

34:04.146 --> 34:06.410
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

34:06.581 --> 34:08.879
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

34:09.051 --> 34:12.714
- Go! I saw something!
- No! What did you see? Shut up!

34:12.888 --> 34:16.380
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

34:16.558 --> 34:18.822
I heard something,
then I saw something.

34:18.994 --> 34:20.688
You didn't hear anything, man.

34:20.862 --> 34:22.726
Well, I saw something.

34:26.534 --> 34:29.902
<i>And you're telling me that guy</i>
<i>in the little short shorts...</i>

34:30.072 --> 34:31.437
- <i>... broke your nose?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

34:31.606 --> 34:35.507
<i>The BeDazzler guy</i>
<i>broke your nose, tough man?</i>

34:50.192 --> 34:52.524
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

34:53.261 --> 34:55.491
How did I get on you?

34:56.231 --> 34:57.926
I wonder.

35:01.503 --> 35:03.801
Watch finally broke.

35:03.972 --> 35:05.564
Crazy. What time is it?

35:09.411 --> 35:10.708
That can't be right.

35:11.980 --> 35:14.039
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

35:14.216 --> 35:16.309
It's 3:00 right now?

35:16.485 --> 35:18.009
Holy shit, man!

35:18.186 --> 35:21.678
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

35:21.857 --> 35:23.324
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

35:23.492 --> 35:26.484
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

35:26.661 --> 35:30.961
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.291
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

35:34.469 --> 35:36.994
My <i>bubbe...</i>
Man, my <i>bubbe's</i> gonna be so pissed.

35:37.172 --> 35:38.230
Shit.

35:38.406 --> 35:40.237
We gotta call Red.

35:40.408 --> 35:43.002
Okay. How?

35:43.178 --> 35:45.203
We'll go to a pay phone.

35:45.380 --> 35:48.645
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

35:48.817 --> 35:50.808
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

35:50.986 --> 35:52.283
Yeah, I know where he lives.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.581
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

35:54.756 --> 35:56.189
"Insinuating." Good word.

35:56.358 --> 35:57.655
Do you know what that means?

35:57.826 --> 36:00.818
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

36:03.632 --> 36:05.759
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

36:05.934 --> 36:07.925
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

36:08.103 --> 36:12.005
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

36:12.174 --> 36:13.801
Wait.

36:14.776 --> 36:16.107
What do you mean, it's dead?

36:16.278 --> 36:19.805
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

36:19.981 --> 36:21.642
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

36:21.816 --> 36:24.307
How can I explain this
to you differently?

36:24.486 --> 36:27.478
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

36:27.656 --> 36:31.183
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.087
How did this happen?

36:34.262 --> 36:37.026
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

36:37.199 --> 36:39.133
Oh, man. To talk radio?

36:39.301 --> 36:41.701
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

36:41.870 --> 36:44.634
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

36:44.806 --> 36:46.933
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

36:47.108 --> 36:48.370
We're gonna go.

36:48.543 --> 36:51.239
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

36:51.413 --> 36:53.347
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.746
Red will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

36:56.918 --> 36:58.180
How does that sound? Good?

36:58.353 --> 37:00.184
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

37:00.355 --> 37:02.949
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

37:03.124 --> 37:05.149
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

37:13.602 --> 37:16.002
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

37:16.171 --> 37:18.571
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:18.740 --> 37:20.640
Thanks for taking care of it.

38:01.383 --> 38:03.681
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

38:06.921 --> 38:09.355
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

38:16.564 --> 38:18.361
Here's good.

38:24.139 --> 38:25.970
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

38:26.141 --> 38:27.699
You're welcome.

38:32.881 --> 38:35.213
- You're sure we can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.009
Who is it?

38:37.185 --> 38:40.848
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

38:41.022 --> 38:44.185
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

38:44.359 --> 38:45.383
Who's this?

38:45.560 --> 38:47.528
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

38:47.696 --> 38:48.720
Dale who?

38:48.897 --> 38:50.865
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

38:51.032 --> 38:52.294
Dale Denton. He's with me.

38:52.467 --> 38:54.799
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

38:54.969 --> 38:57.699
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

38:57.872 --> 39:00.170
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

39:00.342 --> 39:03.038
- Y'all wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

39:03.211 --> 39:05.270
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

39:05.447 --> 39:07.381
Look at that, huh?

39:08.249 --> 39:10.774
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

39:10.952 --> 39:15.582
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

39:15.757 --> 39:17.190
What's up with the clothes?

39:18.893 --> 39:20.224
We were camping.

39:20.395 --> 39:21.828
- Camping?
- Yeah.

39:21.996 --> 39:25.090
Is your lip okay, man?

39:25.266 --> 39:27.291
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

39:28.303 --> 39:29.429
It's a cold sore.

39:29.604 --> 39:33.040
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

39:34.175 --> 39:36.405
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

39:36.578 --> 39:39.138
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

39:39.647 --> 39:41.808
Yeah. Yes, it does.

39:41.983 --> 39:44.816
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

39:44.986 --> 39:47.716
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

39:47.889 --> 39:49.379
Herpes is for life, bro.

39:49.557 --> 39:53.015
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

39:53.194 --> 39:55.822
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

39:55.997 --> 39:57.726
It's from that time. I told you, man.

39:57.899 --> 40:01.266
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

40:01.436 --> 40:04.098
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

40:04.272 --> 40:07.537
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

40:07.709 --> 40:11.167
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

40:11.346 --> 40:14.008
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

40:14.182 --> 40:18.414
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

40:18.586 --> 40:20.315
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

40:20.488 --> 40:21.750
Can I have a piece of that?

40:21.923 --> 40:24.187
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

40:24.359 --> 40:25.849
No, you can't. This is private.

40:26.027 --> 40:27.790
Do you know what today is?

40:27.962 --> 40:30.897
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

40:31.065 --> 40:34.228
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

40:34.402 --> 40:36.370
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

40:36.538 --> 40:37.869
So now who's the funny guy?

40:38.173 --> 40:39.197
Sorry.

40:39.374 --> 40:40.466
Today is his birthday...

40:40.642 --> 40:43.975
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

40:44.145 --> 40:47.410
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

40:47.849 --> 40:49.908
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

40:50.084 --> 40:51.779
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

40:51.953 --> 40:54.046
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

40:54.222 --> 40:55.416
What are we talk...? Guys...

40:55.590 --> 40:57.114
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

40:57.292 --> 40:59.385
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

40:59.561 --> 41:01.552
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

41:01.729 --> 41:03.697
We need to know...

41:03.865 --> 41:05.594
We need to know
about your source.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.098
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

41:07.268 --> 41:10.931
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

41:11.105 --> 41:12.572
I'm not. That's not what I am.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.868
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

41:16.044 --> 41:21.038
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

41:21.216 --> 41:23.980
You don't want any trouble.
We don't wanna give you trouble.

41:24.152 --> 41:26.552
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

41:26.721 --> 41:29.588
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

41:29.757 --> 41:31.657
- You can.
- I totally can.

41:31.826 --> 41:33.589
And for you
to come into my house...

41:33.761 --> 41:36.992
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

41:37.165 --> 41:39.861
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

41:40.034 --> 41:41.262
Look at this. See this?

41:42.003 --> 41:44.233
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

41:44.405 --> 41:45.872
What's the significance of that?

41:46.040 --> 41:48.838
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

41:49.010 --> 41:52.707
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

41:52.881 --> 41:55.349
That's all we need to know.

41:58.453 --> 41:59.977
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

42:00.154 --> 42:02.145
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

42:02.323 --> 42:05.258
Cleared. Over.

42:05.426 --> 42:07.394
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

42:07.562 --> 42:09.223
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

42:09.397 --> 42:12.025
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.293
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

42:14.469 --> 42:15.936
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

42:16.104 --> 42:17.435
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

42:17.605 --> 42:19.299
Yes.

42:19.741 --> 42:21.003
There you go.

42:21.175 --> 42:23.200
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

42:23.378 --> 42:25.471
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

42:25.647 --> 42:28.207
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

42:28.383 --> 42:29.611
You're more chill than me?

42:29.784 --> 42:32.309
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

42:32.487 --> 42:34.387
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

42:34.556 --> 42:37.753
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I like you.

42:37.926 --> 42:40.053
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

42:40.228 --> 42:42.560
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

42:42.730 --> 42:45.460
I'm gonna use the <i>telefono</i>
to call my wife, okay?

42:45.633 --> 42:46.793
- Give her a call.
- I will.

42:46.968 --> 42:49.300
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

42:49.470 --> 42:50.994
Oh, I won't.

42:52.307 --> 42:53.365
Bullshit.

42:54.108 --> 42:55.905
No, no, no.

42:56.077 --> 42:57.544
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

42:57.712 --> 43:00.180
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

43:00.348 --> 43:01.337
No, he's not.

43:01.516 --> 43:03.416
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

43:03.585 --> 43:05.519
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

43:05.687 --> 43:08.155
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

43:08.323 --> 43:09.551
I do not trust you, sir.

43:09.724 --> 43:11.487
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

43:11.659 --> 43:13.650
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.386
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

43:15.563 --> 43:16.723
Fuck you!

43:16.898 --> 43:18.593
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

43:18.766 --> 43:20.028
Oh, Jesus.

43:22.403 --> 43:24.132
Herpes!

43:24.472 --> 43:26.440
I don't wanna have to do this.

43:26.608 --> 43:27.768
Red, you're crazy, man.

43:27.942 --> 43:29.910
You brought the devil
into my house.

43:30.078 --> 43:31.807
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

43:31.980 --> 43:34.039
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

43:35.717 --> 43:38.208
Dale, he's hurting me!

43:38.386 --> 43:39.910
Toilet.

43:40.088 --> 43:41.578
Flush.

43:41.756 --> 43:44.987
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

43:45.159 --> 43:47.491
True!

43:59.874 --> 44:03.605
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

44:04.245 --> 44:06.145
Stay out of here!

44:08.983 --> 44:11.383
Red, don't do it!

44:13.421 --> 44:15.150
- Red!
- You assholes.

44:15.323 --> 44:16.881
You ruined my portable phone.

44:17.058 --> 44:19.253
- Teamwork.
- Yes.

44:20.561 --> 44:22.654
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

44:26.901 --> 44:27.959
Fuck.

44:28.136 --> 44:29.535
Phone.

44:31.873 --> 44:34.068
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

44:34.242 --> 44:36.767
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

44:36.944 --> 44:38.434
Tell us everything, now!

44:38.613 --> 44:39.944
Said they were gonna kill me.

44:40.114 --> 44:42.105
What did you tell Ted?

44:42.283 --> 44:44.217
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

44:44.385 --> 44:45.852
Smash them.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.044
Fuck!

44:47.221 --> 44:48.620
Time out. Time out.

44:48.790 --> 44:49.984
Time out. Time out.

44:50.158 --> 44:51.921
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

44:52.093 --> 44:53.890
- Stop!
- Cheater!

44:54.062 --> 44:55.825
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

44:55.997 --> 44:58.431
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

44:59.667 --> 45:00.691
Fuck.

45:02.203 --> 45:03.670
God...

45:03.838 --> 45:05.135
Fuck!

45:05.306 --> 45:07.297
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

45:09.644 --> 45:11.236
Fuck!

45:14.682 --> 45:16.081
No! No, no, no!

45:16.250 --> 45:18.115
Where you going, huh?

45:18.286 --> 45:20.345
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

45:20.521 --> 45:23.285
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

45:23.458 --> 45:24.857
He's punching my bum!

45:25.026 --> 45:27.790
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

45:27.962 --> 45:31.625
Use words! No! No! No!

45:34.836 --> 45:36.201
You okay, man?

45:36.370 --> 45:38.861
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

45:40.241 --> 45:41.936
Happy birthday.

45:42.443 --> 45:43.467
- All right?
- Thank you.

45:43.644 --> 45:45.942
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

45:46.114 --> 45:48.173
This ends now!

45:52.220 --> 45:53.687
Oh, shit.

45:53.855 --> 45:55.652
Was that too much?

45:57.525 --> 45:59.493
Can't get the edge.

46:00.027 --> 46:01.927
Wait. Got it. Got it.

46:02.096 --> 46:03.222
Hey, Dale.

46:03.397 --> 46:06.730
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

46:06.901 --> 46:08.129
I don't think I am either.

46:08.302 --> 46:11.066
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

46:11.239 --> 46:13.673
Or, just not say anything.

46:14.809 --> 46:18.040
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

46:18.880 --> 46:20.472
Wake up.

46:21.015 --> 46:22.141
Hey, what's up, dudes?

46:22.316 --> 46:25.376
What's up? Tell us everything now.

46:25.553 --> 46:26.577
Talk, Red.

46:26.754 --> 46:29.120
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

46:33.327 --> 46:34.521
Trapped.

46:34.695 --> 46:35.957
Not happening, Red.

46:36.130 --> 46:38.621
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

46:38.800 --> 46:43.294
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

46:43.471 --> 46:46.440
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

46:46.607 --> 46:48.939
Two real big son of a bitches.

46:49.110 --> 46:50.873
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

46:51.045 --> 46:53.673
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

46:53.848 --> 46:55.679
So you guys are basically fucked.

46:55.850 --> 46:58.444
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

46:58.619 --> 47:01.417
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

47:01.589 --> 47:04.854
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

47:05.026 --> 47:07.995
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

47:08.162 --> 47:09.720
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

47:09.897 --> 47:12.092
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

47:12.266 --> 47:13.733
They're in a drug war right now.

47:13.901 --> 47:16.233
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

47:16.404 --> 47:17.996
- It's true.
- What Asians?

47:18.172 --> 47:21.972
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

47:22.143 --> 47:23.167
Vietcong?

47:23.344 --> 47:26.006
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

47:26.180 --> 47:31.777
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

47:31.953 --> 47:32.977
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

47:33.154 --> 47:34.485
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

47:34.655 --> 47:36.020
They're here to kill me.

47:36.190 --> 47:40.058
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

47:40.228 --> 47:42.628
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a new friend.

47:42.797 --> 47:44.992
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

47:45.166 --> 47:47.634
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

47:47.802 --> 47:49.167
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

47:49.337 --> 47:51.100
No sweat.

47:55.576 --> 47:57.476
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

47:57.645 --> 48:00.808
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

48:03.484 --> 48:05.076
Hey. In here.

48:05.253 --> 48:07.244
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

48:07.421 --> 48:09.013
- We should hide.
- Why?

48:09.190 --> 48:11.124
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

48:11.292 --> 48:13.055
...then they'll go to my apartment.

48:13.227 --> 48:16.924
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

48:17.098 --> 48:18.588
No. I think we should stay.

48:18.766 --> 48:21.098
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

48:21.269 --> 48:24.329
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

48:26.307 --> 48:28.798
- They're gone.
- <i>Well, find out what he knows.</i>

48:28.976 --> 48:30.466
Red, it's your last chance, man.

48:30.645 --> 48:32.442
You gonna give us something
we can use?

48:32.613 --> 48:36.014
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

48:36.183 --> 48:38.276
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

48:38.452 --> 48:40.079
He's obviously working with Saul.

48:40.254 --> 48:42.222
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

48:42.390 --> 48:44.051
They kicked the hell out of me...

48:44.225 --> 48:46.420
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

48:46.594 --> 48:49.062
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

48:49.230 --> 48:52.927
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.591
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

48:55.770 --> 48:57.829
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

48:58.005 --> 49:00.166
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

49:00.341 --> 49:02.707
Obviously. We're friends.

49:02.877 --> 49:04.174
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

49:04.345 --> 49:08.247
Dale Denton: not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

49:08.416 --> 49:11.943
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

49:12.119 --> 49:14.610
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

49:14.789 --> 49:16.450
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

49:16.624 --> 49:18.615
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

49:20.294 --> 49:22.057
What the hell are you doing?

49:22.229 --> 49:23.958
Ted told me to kill him.

49:24.131 --> 49:26.929
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

49:27.101 --> 49:29.001
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

49:29.170 --> 49:30.296
- You catch it?
- See what?

49:30.471 --> 49:33.531
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

49:33.708 --> 49:36.734
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

49:37.578 --> 49:39.011
You was ruthless.

49:39.180 --> 49:41.546
You was ruthless, man.

49:41.716 --> 49:44.776
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

49:45.486 --> 49:47.181
I'm gonna die now probably.

49:47.355 --> 49:50.756
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

49:50.925 --> 49:52.449
This how you do me?

49:56.030 --> 49:57.861
So, what did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

49:58.032 --> 49:59.659
I don't know.

50:00.735 --> 50:03.067
There's this guy, Saul...

50:03.637 --> 50:06.572
...something, selling weed who works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

50:06.741 --> 50:08.106
That's all he got out of him.

50:08.275 --> 50:11.711
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

50:11.879 --> 50:13.744
Well, did he say anything else?

50:13.914 --> 50:17.179
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

50:17.351 --> 50:19.478
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

50:19.653 --> 50:21.746
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

50:21.922 --> 50:25.358
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

50:25.860 --> 50:29.261
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

50:29.430 --> 50:31.591
What's his name? Denton?
- to finish the job.

50:32.066 --> 50:33.090
<i>Maybe.</i>

50:33.267 --> 50:36.395
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

50:36.570 --> 50:40.062
<i>I'll have everything there is to know</i>
<i>about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

50:40.241 --> 50:43.642
<i>Who he's screwing,</i>
<i>who's his mother, everything.</i>

50:43.878 --> 50:45.436
I have to take a shit.

50:47.615 --> 50:49.446
Wait. Where are we going?

50:49.617 --> 50:53.917
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

50:54.088 --> 50:56.556
What about my <i>bubbe?</i>
Don't think they'll go after her.

50:56.724 --> 50:59.284
I mean, she has
a different last name.

50:59.460 --> 51:00.791
Belogus.

51:00.961 --> 51:04.294
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

51:20.448 --> 51:22.279
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

51:22.450 --> 51:26.181
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

51:26.353 --> 51:29.254
And you can call it rude.
You can call it whatever you want.

51:29.423 --> 51:32.824
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

51:32.993 --> 51:34.017
Dad, he'll be here.

51:34.195 --> 51:37.255
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

51:37.431 --> 51:40.423
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

51:43.471 --> 51:45.962
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.732
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

51:47.908 --> 51:49.967
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:50.144 --> 51:53.011
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.740
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

51:55.916 --> 51:57.679
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

51:57.852 --> 51:59.979
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

52:00.154 --> 52:01.849
I'll keep guard.

52:02.356 --> 52:03.948
Hey.

52:05.359 --> 52:06.917
Shit.

52:07.094 --> 52:08.652
Oh, no.

52:08.829 --> 52:09.853
Hey, Dale.

52:10.030 --> 52:12.965
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

52:13.134 --> 52:14.158
Dinner.

52:14.969 --> 52:19.235
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

52:19.406 --> 52:20.703
Sit. Please.

52:20.875 --> 52:23.173
Of course. Hi.

52:23.344 --> 52:24.936
- Hi.
- Shannon.

52:25.112 --> 52:26.739
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

52:26.914 --> 52:29.644
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so we can eat.

52:29.817 --> 52:32.251
- Hi, Dale.
- Hey. Okay.

52:32.419 --> 52:33.909
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

52:34.088 --> 52:35.953
I'm supposed to be here right now.

52:36.123 --> 52:37.249
So I'm here.

52:37.424 --> 52:40.587
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

52:40.761 --> 52:44.595
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

52:44.765 --> 52:47.427
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

52:47.601 --> 52:50.764
- In the woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

52:50.938 --> 52:52.838
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

52:53.007 --> 52:55.339
I bird-watch. I don't.

52:55.509 --> 52:58.410
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

52:59.580 --> 53:02.242
I witnessed a murder, okay?

53:02.416 --> 53:04.316
I saw someone
murder someone else...

53:04.485 --> 53:07.010
...and I think
they've been following me.

53:07.188 --> 53:09.452
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

53:09.623 --> 53:11.318
...where Angie has a lot of things.

53:11.492 --> 53:14.461
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

53:14.628 --> 53:15.925
...and it's on my fridge.

53:16.096 --> 53:18.724
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

53:18.899 --> 53:20.594
We should call the police
right away.

53:20.768 --> 53:22.861
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

53:23.037 --> 53:25.562
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

53:25.739 --> 53:28.401
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

53:28.576 --> 53:30.635
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

53:30.811 --> 53:34.338
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

53:34.515 --> 53:37.143
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

53:37.318 --> 53:39.809
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

53:39.987 --> 53:41.818
You are high as a fucking kite.

53:41.989 --> 53:43.456
I'm not high. Let's go.

53:43.624 --> 53:45.717
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

53:45.893 --> 53:48.123
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

53:48.295 --> 53:50.525
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

53:50.698 --> 53:52.689
Your gun? His gun?

53:52.866 --> 53:55.334
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

53:55.502 --> 53:59.495
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

54:15.522 --> 54:17.285
- This is so exciting.
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

54:17.458 --> 54:19.585
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.159
Who is after you, after Angie?

54:21.328 --> 54:24.729
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

54:24.898 --> 54:27.366
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

54:27.534 --> 54:29.968
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

54:30.137 --> 54:33.538
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

54:33.741 --> 54:35.003
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

54:35.175 --> 54:36.904
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

54:37.077 --> 54:40.342
- Angie, what did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

54:40.514 --> 54:42.641
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

54:42.816 --> 54:43.942
- I got it.
- Get it.

54:46.453 --> 54:48.853
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

54:49.023 --> 54:52.015
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

54:56.730 --> 54:57.992
What was that?

54:58.165 --> 55:00.224
That was a gunshot.

55:04.238 --> 55:06.138
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

55:06.307 --> 55:08.241
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

55:08.409 --> 55:10.809
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.707
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

55:12.880 --> 55:15.713
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

55:15.883 --> 55:17.612
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

55:29.096 --> 55:31.064
Anybody out there?

55:34.068 --> 55:36.502
Fucking hide-and-seek.

55:36.670 --> 55:38.297
Say, now.

55:40.808 --> 55:43.174
Hey, the food's still warm.

55:46.246 --> 55:47.440
Love it.

55:47.614 --> 55:49.605
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

55:49.783 --> 55:52.251
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

55:52.419 --> 55:53.750
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

55:53.921 --> 55:56.651
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

55:56.824 --> 55:58.951
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

55:59.126 --> 56:01.219
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

56:01.395 --> 56:04.831
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

56:04.998 --> 56:07.330
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

56:07.501 --> 56:09.628
Use a fake name.

56:10.137 --> 56:12.128
Garagely. I'll contact you.

56:12.306 --> 56:15.275
I don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of...

56:15.442 --> 56:18.138
...but I will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

56:18.312 --> 56:19.609
Fuck off, loser.

56:21.582 --> 56:25.177
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with love.

56:26.620 --> 56:27.644
So get this:

56:27.821 --> 56:29.413
We triangulated the cells.

56:29.590 --> 56:33.151
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

56:33.327 --> 56:35.352
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

56:35.529 --> 56:38.225
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

56:38.399 --> 56:40.765
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

56:40.934 --> 56:44.199
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

56:44.371 --> 56:46.202
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

56:46.373 --> 56:48.864
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

56:49.042 --> 56:51.340
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

57:03.023 --> 57:03.853
Hello?

57:04.057 --> 57:05.081
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

57:05.259 --> 57:06.658
Record this conversation.

57:07.261 --> 57:11.027
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

57:11.198 --> 57:15.191
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

57:15.369 --> 57:19.271
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

57:19.440 --> 57:23.433
<i>... hit men over here last night,</i>
<i>and I and my colleague...</i>

57:23.610 --> 57:26.773
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

57:26.947 --> 57:30.314
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.</i>
<i>Painted it.</i>

57:30.484 --> 57:34.147
And now this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

57:34.321 --> 57:37.916
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

57:38.325 --> 57:39.349
Bring it on.

57:39.526 --> 57:41.960
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

57:42.129 --> 57:44.597
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

57:44.765 --> 57:47.290
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

57:47.468 --> 57:49.129
...and be ready for everything!

57:49.303 --> 57:51.168
You are fucking dead!

57:52.306 --> 57:53.432
You are so dumb.

57:53.607 --> 57:57.099
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us look?

57:58.579 --> 58:01.639
Goddamn it!

58:01.982 --> 58:03.313
Totally sweet.

58:03.717 --> 58:06.015
Ted Jones is slipping.

58:06.186 --> 58:09.815
We shall strike now with full force.

58:10.991 --> 58:13.721
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

58:16.263 --> 58:19.892
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

58:20.067 --> 58:22.661
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

58:22.836 --> 58:25.327
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

58:25.506 --> 58:27.940
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

58:28.108 --> 58:31.908
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

58:32.079 --> 58:35.981
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

58:36.149 --> 58:39.141
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

58:40.387 --> 58:41.877
Yeah.

58:44.525 --> 58:47.153
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

58:47.327 --> 58:48.988
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

58:49.897 --> 58:51.194
Get bus tickets.

58:51.365 --> 58:54.801
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

58:54.968 --> 58:57.232
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

58:57.404 --> 58:59.338
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

58:59.506 --> 59:01.701
But we should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

59:01.875 --> 59:03.069
What?

59:03.243 --> 59:06.371
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

59:06.547 --> 59:09.880
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

59:10.450 --> 59:11.747
What about your sack?

59:11.919 --> 59:14.786
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

59:15.989 --> 59:18.924
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

59:19.092 --> 59:20.559
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

59:20.727 --> 59:22.786
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

59:22.963 --> 59:24.624
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

59:24.798 --> 59:28.825
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

59:29.002 --> 59:31.795
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

59:31.972 --> 59:33.564
These guys are amazing.

59:34.074 --> 59:35.439
What the fuck do you want?

59:35.609 --> 59:37.770
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

59:44.585 --> 59:46.052
What's this stuff called again?

59:46.219 --> 59:48.244
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

59:48.422 --> 59:51.619
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

59:51.792 --> 59:54.659
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at weed too.

59:54.828 --> 59:57.763
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

59:57.931 --> 01:00:00.399
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:04.628
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:06.204
Who the fuck's Chachi?

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:26.183
- How much money you guys got?
- Come on.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.726
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

01:00:28.895 --> 01:00:31.193
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:35.028
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

01:00:35.202 --> 01:00:39.366
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

01:00:39.539 --> 01:00:42.372
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

01:00:44.444 --> 01:00:45.536
You fucking did it, man.

01:00:45.712 --> 01:00:48.374
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

01:00:48.548 --> 01:00:50.982
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:52.641
Get some burritos or something.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.787
Something to drink too.
Something good.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:57.389
See you, man. Nice.

01:01:03.597 --> 01:01:06.998
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.759
Don't move. What's in your hand?

01:01:08.935 --> 01:01:10.698
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

01:01:10.871 --> 01:01:12.566
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

01:01:12.739 --> 01:01:15.264
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

01:01:15.442 --> 01:01:19.708
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.647
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:27.810
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

01:01:27.988 --> 01:01:31.082
And guess what? I just saw three
students walking from back here...

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:34.591
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

01:01:40.801 --> 01:01:42.666
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

01:01:42.836 --> 01:01:44.565
I'm on the hood. Come on.

01:01:44.738 --> 01:01:47.502
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

01:01:47.674 --> 01:01:51.405
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:54.411
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

01:01:58.085 --> 01:02:00.553
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

01:02:02.823 --> 01:02:06.315
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:11.021
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

01:02:11.198 --> 01:02:13.223
425, 425, what's your location?

01:02:14.768 --> 01:02:16.030
You going down.

01:02:16.203 --> 01:02:18.296
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:20.736
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

01:02:20.907 --> 01:02:23.137
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.801
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

01:02:25.979 --> 01:02:28.413
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:30.049
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

01:02:30.217 --> 01:02:32.276
One of them was actually
a police cruiser.

01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:35.319
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:38.356
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

01:02:38.525 --> 01:02:40.425
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:42.357
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

01:02:42.529 --> 01:02:44.019
- Exactly.
- And you saw it?

01:02:44.197 --> 01:02:46.188
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

01:02:46.366 --> 01:02:49.199
- It was a woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

01:02:49.369 --> 01:02:54.272
- I think I know who that bitch was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

01:02:56.209 --> 01:02:58.643
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma'am. Thank you.

01:02:58.812 --> 01:03:00.871
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

01:03:01.047 --> 01:03:03.311
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

01:03:03.483 --> 01:03:05.644
I don't work for the law.
The law works for me.

01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:07.912
I been smelling something
in this department.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:09.453
Keep your eyes on the road.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.853
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

01:03:13.059 --> 01:03:14.424
Son of a bitch!

01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:18.462
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

01:03:24.437 --> 01:03:28.203
No, no, no.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.367
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:34.805
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:37.541
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

01:03:37.717 --> 01:03:39.514
Stop this car!

01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:45.614
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.225
Oh, shit!

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.799
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:54.558
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:57.760
I don't know. They're shooting!

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:05.678
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

01:04:05.846 --> 01:04:07.143
Fuck.

01:04:12.118 --> 01:04:13.642
Dude!

01:04:16.423 --> 01:04:17.981
I can't see! The Slushee!

01:04:18.158 --> 01:04:20.319
- Turn on the wipers!
- It's not working!

01:04:20.493 --> 01:04:22.154
Well, kick out the window!

01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:25.093
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.965
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:33.669
Get your foot out of there.

01:04:34.407 --> 01:04:36.500
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

01:04:36.676 --> 01:04:37.734
Her car's better.

01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:40.311
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.381
Put it into maximum overdrive!

01:04:45.852 --> 01:04:47.945
Oh, no, no, no!

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.287
Oh, shit!

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.153
Get it out!

01:04:55.595 --> 01:04:57.187
I can't see!

01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:06.972
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:11.468
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

01:05:11.645 --> 01:05:13.374
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:18.016
You did it, man.

01:05:19.319 --> 01:05:20.809
All right! Look out!

01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:23.046
Oh, shit!

01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:25.657
Turn around! Turn around!

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.731
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

01:05:35.902 --> 01:05:38.234
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

01:05:38.405 --> 01:05:40.669
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

01:05:44.177 --> 01:05:47.510
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:05:48.415 --> 01:05:49.905
Sorry!

01:05:51.217 --> 01:05:52.809
What the fuck was that?

01:05:52.986 --> 01:05:55.216
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

01:05:55.388 --> 01:05:57.288
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:15.764
Oh, my.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.680
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:25.545
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:28.483
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:31.522
Come back! Saul!

01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:33.056
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

01:06:33.226 --> 01:06:37.162
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

01:06:39.265 --> 01:06:42.530
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

01:06:42.702 --> 01:06:44.431
...l'm moving on.

01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:50.300
Okay.

01:06:50.477 --> 01:06:52.035
All right.

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:56.304
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

01:06:56.483 --> 01:06:57.745
As sure as shit you will.

01:06:57.917 --> 01:06:59.714
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

01:06:59.886 --> 01:07:03.378
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

01:07:03.556 --> 01:07:06.150
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:08.817
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

01:07:08.995 --> 01:07:11.122
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

01:07:11.631 --> 01:07:13.360
So smile.

01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.091
Shut up.

01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:21.871
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.040
All right. Are you using protection?

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:26.269
- <i>Days Inn.</i>
- Yes.

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:28.311
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

01:07:29.149 --> 01:07:31.083
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, is Angie there?</i>

01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:33.082
- Dale.
- <i>Angie?</i>

01:07:33.253 --> 01:07:35.949
- My God, are you okay?
- <i>I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

01:07:36.122 --> 01:07:37.453
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:07:37.624 --> 01:07:39.216
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:41.553
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

01:07:41.728 --> 01:07:44.595
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

01:07:44.764 --> 01:07:49.667
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

01:07:49.836 --> 01:07:52.737
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation</i>
<i>right now because of you...</i>

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:55.773
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

01:07:55.942 --> 01:07:57.466
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

01:07:57.644 --> 01:08:00.807
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.847
<i>B, what does that have to do with</i>
<i>anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

01:08:04.017 --> 01:08:05.314
And now I'm dealing with it.

01:08:05.485 --> 01:08:07.976
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:10.645
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

01:08:10.824 --> 01:08:12.314
- <i>We have to work through it.</i>
- No.

01:08:12.492 --> 01:08:13.959
This doesn't happen to anyone.

01:08:14.127 --> 01:08:16.595
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.060
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:20.756
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:24.267
Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:25.768
What the fuck does that mean?

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:28.567
<i>It means that you are gonna go</i>
<i>to college next year.</i>

01:08:28.741 --> 01:08:30.834
<i>You'll get into</i>
<i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.170
<i>... and the fucking Shins.</i>

01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:34.904
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes</i>
<i>and become a lesbian...</i>

01:08:35.081 --> 01:08:37.810
<i>... and I'll be here in fucking</i>
<i>Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:40.384
<i>You're gonna dump me.</i>
<i>So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

01:08:40.553 --> 01:08:42.645
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

01:08:42.822 --> 01:08:44.551
<i>You never did like me anyway,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

01:08:44.724 --> 01:08:46.247
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:49.020
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:50.423
I always care about you.

01:08:50.596 --> 01:08:52.428
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

01:08:52.599 --> 01:08:55.033
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

01:08:55.201 --> 01:08:59.331
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:01.531
Call me when I can go home.

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:06.935
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

01:09:07.113 --> 01:09:10.344
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

01:09:11.017 --> 01:09:13.212
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:17.515
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.214
I love you.

01:09:19.392 --> 01:09:21.553
You wise-ass.

01:09:22.395 --> 01:09:25.158
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:27.731
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:28.993
First things first.

01:09:30.937 --> 01:09:34.372
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:36.702
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:38.309
That clearly just happened...

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.844
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

01:09:41.014 --> 01:09:42.982
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.310
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:48.352
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.988
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

01:09:51.157 --> 01:09:54.524
- we are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:57.424
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

01:09:57.597 --> 01:10:00.430
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.033
What do you gotta say to that?

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.762
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

01:10:04.938 --> 01:10:06.064
But you didn't save me.

01:10:06.239 --> 01:10:08.139
She was gonna help,
you made things worse.

01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:10.173
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

01:10:10.343 --> 01:10:12.334
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:14.173
Only reason I started selling pot...

01:10:14.347 --> 01:10:16.941
...is so I could put my <i>bubbe</i>
in a nice retirement home.

01:10:17.116 --> 01:10:19.277
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

01:10:19.452 --> 01:10:20.783
I'm gonna become something.

01:10:20.954 --> 01:10:23.479
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

01:10:23.656 --> 01:10:25.988
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:27.649
Little kids can take shits.

01:10:27.827 --> 01:10:29.454
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

01:10:29.629 --> 01:10:31.722
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.458
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

01:10:34.634 --> 01:10:37.831
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

01:10:38.004 --> 01:10:40.438
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

01:10:40.607 --> 01:10:43.098
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

01:10:43.276 --> 01:10:45.107
Boring people to death on the radio.

01:10:45.278 --> 01:10:48.873
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

01:10:49.048 --> 01:10:50.913
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:54.053
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.847
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

01:10:56.022 --> 01:10:58.513
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

01:10:58.691 --> 01:11:00.488
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.992
You were cold and I clothed you.

01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:06.762
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

01:11:06.933 --> 01:11:08.560
You didn't say anything back.

01:11:08.735 --> 01:11:11.295
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

01:11:11.471 --> 01:11:12.938
You are my drug dealer.

01:11:13.106 --> 01:11:14.835
There's one reason
we know each other.

01:11:15.008 --> 01:11:17.033
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:20.441
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were...

01:11:20.613 --> 01:11:23.741
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

01:11:25.718 --> 01:11:28.710
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

01:11:28.888 --> 01:11:30.446
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:33.057
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

01:11:33.226 --> 01:11:35.251
What? That's not even
an expression.

01:11:35.428 --> 01:11:38.158
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:40.196
I'm sorry, man. Look...

01:11:40.667 --> 01:11:44.159
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

01:11:44.337 --> 01:11:46.897
Come on, man. Don't do that.

01:11:47.073 --> 01:11:49.166
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

01:11:49.342 --> 01:11:51.742
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

01:11:51.911 --> 01:11:54.141
I didn't mean that.

01:12:06.559 --> 01:12:09.323
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

01:12:52.305 --> 01:12:53.932
That looks great.

01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:03.014
Hello?

01:13:04.117 --> 01:13:05.414
Dale?

01:13:05.585 --> 01:13:06.950
<i>It is Dale.</i>

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.989
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the world...

01:13:12.158 --> 01:13:15.594
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

01:13:15.762 --> 01:13:17.491
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

01:13:17.663 --> 01:13:21.258
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

01:13:21.434 --> 01:13:24.130
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

01:13:24.303 --> 01:13:26.464
<i>So please</i>
<i>just take me back, please.</i>

01:13:26.639 --> 01:13:28.732
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you.

01:13:30.109 --> 01:13:33.044
- Yeah?
- <i>I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

01:13:33.212 --> 01:13:36.670
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

01:13:36.849 --> 01:13:38.077
I don't know. I just...

01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:39.650
I wanna marry you.

01:13:42.755 --> 01:13:44.416
I made a mistake.

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.922
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- I've...

01:13:47.326 --> 01:13:49.726
- What?
- <i>I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

01:13:49.896 --> 01:13:52.490
- <i>You wanna... Oh, fuck.</i>
- What?

01:13:52.665 --> 01:13:54.223
I don't know.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.527
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

01:13:56.702 --> 01:13:58.636
...then you are very naive
and immature.

01:13:58.805 --> 01:14:02.366
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

01:14:02.542 --> 01:14:05.670
- You're the one that's immature.
- <i>I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

01:14:05.845 --> 01:14:09.042
<i>I am somewhat immature,</i>
<i>but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

01:14:09.215 --> 01:14:10.512
Just because you're older.

01:14:10.683 --> 01:14:13.208
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

01:14:13.386 --> 01:14:15.547
- <i>Really?</i>
- How many girls have you slept with?

01:14:15.721 --> 01:14:17.814
- Like, two and a half.
- <i>Two and a half?</i>

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.184
What is a half? Your hand?

01:14:19.358 --> 01:14:22.293
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.</i>
<i>I can't remember why.</i>

01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:25.124
<i>I remember thinking,</i>
<i>"This doesn't count as a full point."</i>

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:27.664
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.</i>
<i>I was drunk.</i>

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:29.165
<i>Screw you.</i>

01:14:29.335 --> 01:14:30.495
Get me out of this room.

01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:33.730
<i>I will, and that's the last</i>
<i>you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

01:14:35.908 --> 01:14:39.708
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:45.213
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

01:14:46.652 --> 01:14:47.949
Lookit there. Lookit there.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.951
Do you use the pool over here?

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:52.886
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

01:14:53.059 --> 01:14:56.256
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

01:14:56.429 --> 01:14:58.363
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

01:14:58.531 --> 01:15:01.261
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

01:15:01.434 --> 01:15:03.425
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

01:15:03.603 --> 01:15:06.265
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:15:06.439 --> 01:15:07.565
May I call you Faye?

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:10.868
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:12.567
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

01:15:12.745 --> 01:15:14.269
What do you want from me?

01:15:14.447 --> 01:15:15.812
<i>Bubbe.</i> Hey, guys.

01:15:15.982 --> 01:15:18.473
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

01:15:22.588 --> 01:15:23.612
Damn.

01:15:24.557 --> 01:15:25.888
Oh, shit.

01:15:26.058 --> 01:15:27.650
Sorry, Betty.

01:15:32.064 --> 01:15:34.430
They kidnapped my grandson.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.500
Yeah, these two guys came in...

01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:39.661
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

01:15:39.839 --> 01:15:41.932
I never saw them in my life before.

01:15:42.108 --> 01:15:45.271
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

01:15:45.444 --> 01:15:49.904
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

01:15:50.082 --> 01:15:53.848
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.351
...but he was short as shit.

01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:57.455
But the worst part was...

01:15:57.623 --> 01:16:01.992
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:04.152
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:05.592
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

01:16:05.765 --> 01:16:07.630
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.324
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

01:16:15.007 --> 01:16:18.204
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

01:16:18.377 --> 01:16:20.140
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

01:16:20.313 --> 01:16:23.146
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

01:16:23.316 --> 01:16:25.511
Where am I, man? What?

01:16:25.685 --> 01:16:29.143
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

01:16:29.322 --> 01:16:30.653
Shit. Did I do that?

01:16:32.325 --> 01:16:35.317
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

01:16:35.962 --> 01:16:37.827
Fuck you, man!

01:16:37.997 --> 01:16:40.693
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

01:16:40.866 --> 01:16:42.197
Ted wants him alive, okay?

01:16:42.368 --> 01:16:44.359
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

01:16:44.537 --> 01:16:47.938
- If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like Hamburglar.

01:16:48.107 --> 01:16:49.131
And the Elephant Man.

01:16:49.308 --> 01:16:51.503
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

01:16:51.677 --> 01:16:53.406
Professional. Professional.

01:16:53.579 --> 01:16:55.706
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

01:16:55.881 --> 01:16:58.008
- Where were you?
- I was there.

01:16:58.184 --> 01:17:00.049
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

01:17:00.219 --> 01:17:01.880
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

01:17:02.054 --> 01:17:04.249
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

01:17:04.423 --> 01:17:06.823
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

01:17:06.993 --> 01:17:10.224
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

01:17:10.396 --> 01:17:12.557
I don't wanna go near this guy.

01:17:12.732 --> 01:17:15.701
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

01:17:15.868 --> 01:17:17.495
I might act tough...

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:19.729
...but I got a lot of feelings.

01:17:20.139 --> 01:17:23.040
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

01:17:24.076 --> 01:17:25.771
This ain't over.

01:17:26.245 --> 01:17:28.110
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.339
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

01:17:30.516 --> 01:17:33.781
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:36.217
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

01:17:36.389 --> 01:17:39.449
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:40.649
Watch your head.

01:17:42.595 --> 01:17:44.392
Hey, watch him.

01:17:46.232 --> 01:17:47.460
Oh, my God.

01:17:47.633 --> 01:17:49.965
El Dorado.

01:17:50.302 --> 01:17:52.532
The legends are true.

01:17:53.139 --> 01:17:55.334
Look at all this weed, man.

01:17:55.508 --> 01:17:57.237
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.776
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

01:17:59.945 --> 01:18:01.742
OG Kush?

01:18:01.914 --> 01:18:03.245
OG Kush.

01:18:10.423 --> 01:18:13.051
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:18:13.225 --> 01:18:14.886
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

01:18:15.061 --> 01:18:16.961
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:34.141
Hello?

01:18:34.313 --> 01:18:35.712
Red?

01:18:41.887 --> 01:18:43.787
- Red?
- What the fuck?

01:18:43.956 --> 01:18:46.754
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

01:18:46.926 --> 01:18:50.020
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

01:18:50.196 --> 01:18:51.629
Good.

01:18:51.797 --> 01:18:54.527
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.565
You don't look great.

01:18:56.736 --> 01:18:58.260
They shot me, Denton.

01:18:58.437 --> 01:18:59.734
They got me right here.

01:18:59.905 --> 01:19:01.236
- Yeah?
- Right here.

01:19:01.407 --> 01:19:03.204
And then they got me again
right here.

01:19:03.375 --> 01:19:06.606
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:08.303
They'll save your life, okay?

01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:10.381
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

01:19:10.549 --> 01:19:13.177
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

01:19:13.352 --> 01:19:15.616
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

01:19:15.788 --> 01:19:17.881
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:20.992
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.787
He's just, like, an asshole.

01:19:22.962 --> 01:19:25.897
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:27.930
You know Ted? He took Saul.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.465
And I'm gonna get him back.

01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:31.626
You know, like, he saved my life.

01:19:31.804 --> 01:19:34.932
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

01:19:35.107 --> 01:19:37.940
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:39.168
I was mean to him, man.

01:19:39.345 --> 01:19:42.075
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

01:19:42.248 --> 01:19:45.911
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:49.987
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

01:19:50.156 --> 01:19:52.090
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

01:19:52.258 --> 01:19:56.217
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

01:19:56.395 --> 01:20:00.525
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

01:20:00.699 --> 01:20:03.065
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

01:20:03.235 --> 01:20:06.102
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

01:20:06.272 --> 01:20:09.036
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:12.939
Or a worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:15.512
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

01:20:15.681 --> 01:20:17.239
...you'll come back as an eagle.

01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:18.974
You'll come back as a dragon.

01:20:19.151 --> 01:20:20.812
You'll come back as Jude Law.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.815
Okay? Which would you rather be?

01:20:23.989 --> 01:20:27.322
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

01:20:27.493 --> 01:20:28.517
It belongs to me.

01:20:28.694 --> 01:20:30.127
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

01:20:30.296 --> 01:20:34.130
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.528
You'll have a second wind.

01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:38.101
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:40.932
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

01:20:41.106 --> 01:20:44.269
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

01:20:44.443 --> 01:20:46.741
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

01:20:46.912 --> 01:20:48.573
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

01:20:48.747 --> 01:20:51.045
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

01:20:51.217 --> 01:20:52.980
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:55.985
Come here.

01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:02.888
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

01:21:05.364 --> 01:21:07.423
Thug life.

01:21:13.405 --> 01:21:14.633
Oh, shit.

01:21:14.807 --> 01:21:17.537
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:19.769
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:21:26.752 --> 01:21:29.448
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.360
Don't.

01:21:36.528 --> 01:21:37.552
Don't.

01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:39.391
Just something quick like that.

01:21:39.565 --> 01:21:41.055
- Don't.
- Yeah.

01:21:41.233 --> 01:21:43.360
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

01:21:56.649 --> 01:21:58.480
Oh, God.

01:22:01.153 --> 01:22:03.212
That's a big hideout.

01:22:05.157 --> 01:22:07.182
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

01:22:07.359 --> 01:22:10.328
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

01:22:10.496 --> 01:22:13.397
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

01:22:13.565 --> 01:22:15.999
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

01:22:16.168 --> 01:22:18.261
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

01:22:18.437 --> 01:22:21.338
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

01:22:21.507 --> 01:22:23.668
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

01:22:23.842 --> 01:22:26.208
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

01:22:26.378 --> 01:22:27.572
This could be your moment.

01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:30.306
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

01:22:30.482 --> 01:22:31.506
Fuck you.

01:22:31.684 --> 01:22:33.845
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

01:22:34.019 --> 01:22:38.217
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

01:22:38.924 --> 01:22:41.791
Carol, she's cool now.

01:22:41.961 --> 01:22:45.897
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

01:22:46.065 --> 01:22:48.363
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

01:22:48.534 --> 01:22:50.934
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

01:22:51.103 --> 01:22:53.401
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

01:22:53.572 --> 01:22:55.802
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

01:22:55.975 --> 01:22:57.499
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

01:22:57.676 --> 01:22:59.268
Put them down. On the ground.

01:22:59.445 --> 01:23:01.811
All right, everybody just chill.

01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:03.881
Oh, my God!

01:23:04.049 --> 01:23:05.710
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:08.409
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:10.885
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

01:23:11.056 --> 01:23:12.853
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

01:23:13.025 --> 01:23:15.755
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

01:23:15.928 --> 01:23:18.419
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

01:23:18.597 --> 01:23:20.531
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

01:23:20.699 --> 01:23:22.826
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

01:23:23.002 --> 01:23:24.799
End of story.

01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:26.995
I'm telling Ted.

01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:28.935
- If you do...
- He's got a piece.

01:23:29.108 --> 01:23:30.700
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:23:30.876 --> 01:23:32.537
He's got another one, in the side.

01:23:32.711 --> 01:23:34.303
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.744
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

01:23:36.915 --> 01:23:39.076
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:40.479
No. Come on.

01:23:43.555 --> 01:23:46.023
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

01:23:46.191 --> 01:23:47.283
- Dale.
- Yes.

01:23:47.459 --> 01:23:50.622
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

01:23:50.796 --> 01:23:52.661
- No, man.
- Yes.

01:23:52.831 --> 01:23:54.526
I'm here to save you.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.362
No. You just got caught too.

01:23:57.536 --> 01:23:59.902
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

01:24:00.072 --> 01:24:02.131
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

01:24:02.307 --> 01:24:05.140
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.473
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

01:24:08.881 --> 01:24:11.850
Okay? And I know there's no way...

01:24:12.017 --> 01:24:14.451
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.680
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

01:24:17.856 --> 01:24:20.381
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

01:24:20.559 --> 01:24:22.288
You're a mean jerk.

01:24:22.461 --> 01:24:25.430
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

01:24:25.597 --> 01:24:27.827
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.696
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my life was.

01:24:30.869 --> 01:24:33.337
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:34.995
You're the best guy I know.

01:24:35.707 --> 01:24:37.004
BFFF.

01:24:37.176 --> 01:24:39.610
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

01:24:42.948 --> 01:24:45.143
- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:24:45.317 --> 01:24:47.717
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:24:47.886 --> 01:24:49.217
Oh, I'm such a dick.

01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:52.551
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

01:24:52.724 --> 01:24:55.625
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

01:24:55.794 --> 01:24:57.523
- I know. They are.
- Fuck, man.

01:24:57.696 --> 01:25:02.030
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:04.761
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:25:04.937 --> 01:25:07.064
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

01:25:07.239 --> 01:25:08.729
I do.

01:25:08.907 --> 01:25:10.704
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

01:25:11.477 --> 01:25:14.810
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.438
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

01:25:19.818 --> 01:25:21.410
- Is it working?
- I can't feel it.

01:25:21.587 --> 01:25:22.611
I can't feel you.

01:25:22.788 --> 01:25:24.722
- Wait, I feel it.
- I feel it. Yes, okay.

01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:26.289
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:28.551
- I'm gonna save you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:28.727 --> 01:25:30.490
- Let me save you.
- Save me, Dale.

01:25:30.662 --> 01:25:32.527
It's not working.
We gotta change angles.

01:25:32.698 --> 01:25:34.928
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.590
Okay, that's good. That's good.

01:25:36.768 --> 01:25:38.702
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

01:25:38.871 --> 01:25:40.964
- All right. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:25:42.074 --> 01:25:44.201
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

01:25:44.376 --> 01:25:46.776
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

01:25:46.945 --> 01:25:49.243
- You're my best friend, man.
- Yeah, see?

01:25:49.414 --> 01:25:52.508
- It's not working.
- Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

01:25:52.684 --> 01:25:54.652
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.913
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:57.089 --> 01:25:58.954
Harder.

01:26:07.566 --> 01:26:09.966
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

01:26:10.135 --> 01:26:12.831
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

01:26:13.005 --> 01:26:15.906
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

01:26:16.074 --> 01:26:17.507
It's gross.

01:26:17.676 --> 01:26:19.940
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

01:26:20.112 --> 01:26:23.912
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

01:26:24.082 --> 01:26:26.277
Plugged him, just whacked him.

01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:29.682
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

01:26:29.855 --> 01:26:31.413
He shot Pete?

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:33.581
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

01:26:33.759 --> 01:26:36.284
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

01:26:36.461 --> 01:26:39.760
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

01:26:44.303 --> 01:26:46.362
Time to cook shit up tonight.

01:26:46.538 --> 01:26:48.563
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

01:26:49.942 --> 01:26:51.842
Stop. Wait here.

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:54.774
No retreat, no surrender.

01:27:00.252 --> 01:27:01.276
Yes, yes, yes.

01:27:01.453 --> 01:27:04.286
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:27:04.456 --> 01:27:07.857
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

01:27:08.026 --> 01:27:10.221
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

01:27:10.395 --> 01:27:12.295
Just don't. Don't...

01:27:17.903 --> 01:27:20.963
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

01:27:21.139 --> 01:27:25.235
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:26.900
Stop.

01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:32.842
See, I don't think
you understood me.

01:27:33.018 --> 01:27:34.849
I can hear everything you're saying.

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.716
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:40.380
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

01:27:40.559 --> 01:27:42.823
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

01:27:42.995 --> 01:27:44.553
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:47.164
What the fuck is that?

01:27:49.468 --> 01:27:50.492
Dale!

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.041
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

01:28:00.345 --> 01:28:02.677
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

01:28:09.187 --> 01:28:10.677
You shot me.

01:28:10.856 --> 01:28:12.221
I'm sorry, man.

01:28:12.391 --> 01:28:16.088
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

01:28:16.261 --> 01:28:17.888
I got glass in my ass.

01:28:18.063 --> 01:28:20.657
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

01:28:20.832 --> 01:28:22.925
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:27.329
Asians!

01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:33.311
War is upon you!

01:28:33.478 --> 01:28:35.275
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

01:28:41.453 --> 01:28:42.545
Get down, motherfucker!

01:28:47.092 --> 01:28:48.320
Come on!

01:28:51.029 --> 01:28:52.257
Fuck!

01:29:01.673 --> 01:29:03.004
Go! Go!

01:29:03.175 --> 01:29:04.335
Get down, baby!

01:29:04.509 --> 01:29:06.238
Dale, no!

01:29:06.411 --> 01:29:08.038
No, wake up, man.

01:29:08.213 --> 01:29:10.078
No, you're not dying, man.

01:29:10.248 --> 01:29:12.808
Not without me.

01:29:12.984 --> 01:29:14.315
- Dale.
- What?

01:29:14.486 --> 01:29:16.317
You're alive.

01:29:16.488 --> 01:29:20.015
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

01:29:20.592 --> 01:29:22.651
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

01:29:22.828 --> 01:29:25.558
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

01:29:26.698 --> 01:29:28.325
Fuck!

01:29:30.602 --> 01:29:32.092
- Help!
- My ear.

01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:33.294
- Yeah.
- Help!

01:29:33.472 --> 01:29:35.565
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

01:29:35.741 --> 01:29:37.641
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

01:29:37.809 --> 01:29:38.833
You shot him?

01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:41.240
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

01:29:41.413 --> 01:29:43.040
We've had enough out of you.

01:29:43.215 --> 01:29:44.443
I'm not your friend.

01:29:44.616 --> 01:29:45.981
Maybe I can just...

01:29:46.151 --> 01:29:48.142
No. No, infected.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.720
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

01:30:25.223 --> 01:30:26.884
It's clear.

01:30:27.826 --> 01:30:30.158
Dude. Look.

01:30:30.328 --> 01:30:31.886
Nice.

01:30:44.242 --> 01:30:45.766
Bullets.

01:30:53.919 --> 01:30:56.752
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

01:30:56.922 --> 01:31:00.255
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

01:31:00.425 --> 01:31:02.484
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

01:31:02.661 --> 01:31:04.629
I feel like I can smell it.

01:31:04.796 --> 01:31:07.264
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

01:31:07.432 --> 01:31:08.490
You can't even tell.

01:31:08.667 --> 01:31:09.759
That's a good point.

01:31:09.935 --> 01:31:11.334
Wait.

01:31:54.045 --> 01:31:55.410
Did you shoot that guy?

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.172
No. I'm out of bullets.

01:31:57.349 --> 01:31:58.873
Me too.

01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:01.314
Maybe it was ricochet.

01:32:01.486 --> 01:32:03.477
Gravity.

01:32:03.655 --> 01:32:05.384
Oh, nice.

01:32:05.557 --> 01:32:07.491
You go down.

01:32:07.659 --> 01:32:08.819
I'll cover.

01:32:08.994 --> 01:32:12.157
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

01:32:16.668 --> 01:32:18.499
Sexy motherfucker.

01:32:37.155 --> 01:32:39.555
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

01:32:39.724 --> 01:32:41.988
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.391
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

01:32:47.132 --> 01:32:48.929
Oh, nice.

01:32:50.435 --> 01:32:52.027
Here we go. Okay.

01:32:52.203 --> 01:32:55.138
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

01:32:58.043 --> 01:32:59.067
Nice.

01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:01.542
Nice. Okay.

01:33:01.713 --> 01:33:02.975
Pull me up.

01:33:03.148 --> 01:33:04.945
I'm ready. Go.

01:33:05.116 --> 01:33:06.913
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

01:33:07.085 --> 01:33:09.519
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

01:33:09.688 --> 01:33:11.679
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

01:33:11.856 --> 01:33:14.586
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

01:33:14.759 --> 01:33:17.557
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

01:33:20.498 --> 01:33:21.522
Dale!

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.224
I'll get help. I'll get help.

01:33:25.036 --> 01:33:28.267
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

01:34:55.927 --> 01:34:57.758
Give me that fire extinguisher.

01:34:57.929 --> 01:34:59.123
Okay.

01:35:20.452 --> 01:35:23.785
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

01:35:23.955 --> 01:35:25.115
Now!

01:35:40.038 --> 01:35:41.164
Fuck you!

01:35:46.311 --> 01:35:49.212
Fuck the police!

01:36:09.734 --> 01:36:12.100
Motherfucking kill you!

01:36:14.506 --> 01:36:17.031
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

01:36:18.143 --> 01:36:19.633
Oh, shit!

01:36:19.811 --> 01:36:21.005
Come here!

01:36:28.353 --> 01:36:30.287
I hate you!

01:36:30.455 --> 01:36:32.719
No! Ted, stop it!

01:36:39.664 --> 01:36:42.565
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

01:36:42.734 --> 01:36:44.702
You're in the jungle now, baby.

01:36:52.677 --> 01:36:53.735
Jesus!

01:37:01.152 --> 01:37:02.676
Fuck.

01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:13.488
Gonna die.

01:37:16.134 --> 01:37:18.500
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

01:37:19.571 --> 01:37:21.505
But you weren't gonna stop.

01:37:28.046 --> 01:37:29.604
Shoot him!

01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:32.113
Just take it easy, buddy.

01:37:33.885 --> 01:37:36.251
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:41.153
I'm hungry.

01:37:41.326 --> 01:37:43.260
I'm going home.

01:37:47.165 --> 01:37:48.826
All right.

01:37:50.435 --> 01:37:52.096
Help.

01:37:54.873 --> 01:37:56.602
I knew you were going soft.

01:37:56.774 --> 01:37:59.868
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

01:38:00.044 --> 01:38:02.103
Fucked up, man.

01:38:04.315 --> 01:38:07.876
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

01:38:08.052 --> 01:38:09.485
What's up, sir?

01:38:10.121 --> 01:38:13.921
- Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:38:14.092 --> 01:38:18.586
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

01:38:18.763 --> 01:38:21.357
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

01:38:21.532 --> 01:38:23.659
...and watch yourself get killed now.

01:38:23.835 --> 01:38:25.268
All right.

01:38:25.436 --> 01:38:27.495
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

01:38:27.672 --> 01:38:31.267
All right. This is how it ends.

01:38:47.425 --> 01:38:51.521
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

01:38:51.696 --> 01:38:53.186
How you like me now, huh?

01:38:54.532 --> 01:38:55.692
Gross.

01:38:55.867 --> 01:38:56.891
Red?

01:38:57.335 --> 01:38:58.495
Saul.

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:01.571
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

01:39:01.739 --> 01:39:03.400
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

01:39:04.242 --> 01:39:05.732
Bro's before ho's.

01:39:06.444 --> 01:39:09.413
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.017
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

01:39:14.185 --> 01:39:17.780
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

01:39:17.956 --> 01:39:21.756
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

01:39:21.926 --> 01:39:24.918
...I wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

01:39:25.697 --> 01:39:28.564
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.293
I wanna be inside you, homes.

01:39:32.537 --> 01:39:34.300
No more lies, Red.

01:39:34.472 --> 01:39:36.997
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:41.100
Red!

01:39:58.763 --> 01:40:01.698
You know what? I'm feeling it.

01:40:01.866 --> 01:40:03.731
Red, I'm coming, baby.

01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:06.335
Your stupidity amazes me.

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.503
Hey, Ted!

01:40:10.675 --> 01:40:12.643
You killed my brother...

01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:15.904
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.106
Suck my balls! Two times!

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.050
Bitch!

01:40:28.226 --> 01:40:29.750
Bring it on.

01:40:41.372 --> 01:40:42.396
Shit. Dale.

01:40:43.941 --> 01:40:46.136
Dale!

01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:47.971
Holy shit!

01:41:24.482 --> 01:41:25.506
Sorry, Ted.

01:41:29.687 --> 01:41:31.655
You've been served.

01:41:38.796 --> 01:41:41.560
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:41:41.732 --> 01:41:44.257
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:41:48.539 --> 01:41:50.166
Saul! Saul!

01:41:55.746 --> 01:41:58.681
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

01:41:58.850 --> 01:42:00.681
Come to me!

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.585
You're not dying today, friend.

01:42:04.755 --> 01:42:07.622
Not on my watch.

01:42:34.619 --> 01:42:37.816
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

01:42:37.989 --> 01:42:39.422
Saul.

01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:41.080
Wake up.

01:42:41.259 --> 01:42:43.693
Oh, sweet Saul.

01:42:46.197 --> 01:42:48.893
Saul.

01:42:51.736 --> 01:42:53.533
Yes. Yeah.

01:42:53.704 --> 01:42:55.171
Saul, you made it.

01:42:55.339 --> 01:42:57.864
- What?
- Yeah.

01:42:58.042 --> 01:42:59.976
Where am I?

01:43:00.144 --> 01:43:02.169
You made it, man.

01:43:02.346 --> 01:43:04.871
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

01:43:05.049 --> 01:43:08.075
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

01:43:08.252 --> 01:43:09.583
What happened?

01:43:09.754 --> 01:43:10.982
What happened?

01:43:17.495 --> 01:43:19.895
Holy shit.

01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:25.530
What's that?

01:43:28.306 --> 01:43:30.171
Hi.

01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:32.206
- Red?
- Red?

01:43:35.046 --> 01:43:37.810
- Red.
- Hey.

01:43:37.982 --> 01:43:41.315
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

01:43:41.485 --> 01:43:42.577
He came back to save us.

01:43:42.753 --> 01:43:43.811
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

01:43:43.988 --> 01:43:45.421
All right, man.

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:47.717
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

01:43:47.892 --> 01:43:50.759
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

01:43:50.928 --> 01:43:54.557
We made it. Oh, we made it.

01:44:00.004 --> 01:44:04.964
<i>Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.</i>
<i>I am Dale Denton.</i>

01:44:05.142 --> 01:44:08.976
<i>The topic of the day: new beginnings.</i>
<i>Getting over losses.</i>

01:44:09.146 --> 01:44:11.546
<i>Friends. Life.</i>

01:44:11.716 --> 01:44:14.310
We have our first caller.

01:44:14.485 --> 01:44:17.113
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

01:44:17.288 --> 01:44:18.915
Hi. Am I on the air?

01:44:19.090 --> 01:44:22.116
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

01:44:22.293 --> 01:44:23.351
A D in the face.

01:44:23.527 --> 01:44:24.892
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

01:44:25.062 --> 01:44:26.996
You're my hero.

01:44:27.164 --> 01:44:29.689
You're my hero.

01:44:30.401 --> 01:44:31.891
You are good, man. Seriously.

01:44:32.069 --> 01:44:33.969
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

01:44:34.138 --> 01:44:36.129
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

01:44:36.307 --> 01:44:39.105
- It's not bad, huh?
- If I close my eyes, it sounds like...

01:44:39.277 --> 01:44:42.371
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

01:44:42.546 --> 01:44:45.413
- If you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

01:44:45.583 --> 01:44:47.949
It's like when my <i>bubbe</i>
was always playing opera...

01:44:48.119 --> 01:44:49.950
...I hated it, but my <i>bubbe</i> loves it.

01:44:50.121 --> 01:44:52.919
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:55.684
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:57.953
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:59.892
...I like you now.

01:45:00.064 --> 01:45:03.522
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

01:45:03.701 --> 01:45:05.726
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

01:45:05.903 --> 01:45:09.134
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

01:45:09.307 --> 01:45:12.105
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

01:45:12.276 --> 01:45:14.471
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

01:45:14.645 --> 01:45:16.044
We should get a three-way one.

01:45:16.213 --> 01:45:19.842
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

01:45:20.017 --> 01:45:22.952
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.022
I know we've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

01:45:27.191 --> 01:45:29.921
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

01:45:30.094 --> 01:45:32.619
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

01:45:32.797 --> 01:45:35.664
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

01:45:35.833 --> 01:45:38.700
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

01:45:38.869 --> 01:45:41.599
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

01:45:41.772 --> 01:45:43.330
Is that us getting a time-share?

01:45:43.507 --> 01:45:45.907
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

01:45:46.077 --> 01:45:48.443
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

01:45:48.612 --> 01:45:51.172
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

01:45:51.349 --> 01:45:54.443
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

01:45:54.618 --> 01:45:56.609
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

01:45:56.787 --> 01:45:58.254
You fuckhead.

01:45:58.422 --> 01:46:00.982
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

01:46:01.158 --> 01:46:03.752
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

01:46:03.928 --> 01:46:06.863
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

01:46:07.031 --> 01:46:11.058
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

01:46:11.235 --> 01:46:13.169
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

01:46:13.337 --> 01:46:15.532
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

01:46:15.706 --> 01:46:19.437
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood left?

01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:22.477
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

01:46:22.646 --> 01:46:24.409
- You're losing stuff.
- Here.

01:46:24.582 --> 01:46:26.447
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

01:46:26.617 --> 01:46:30.075
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

01:46:32.289 --> 01:46:34.757
It's a miracle.
I think we should all take a moment...

01:46:34.925 --> 01:46:37.485
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

01:46:37.661 --> 01:46:39.652
And that we became friends
in the process...

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:42.060
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

01:46:42.233 --> 01:46:46.465
Should we touch each other's hands
while we do it? Okay.

01:46:48.506 --> 01:46:49.939
I love you guys.

01:46:50.107 --> 01:46:52.473
I love you dudes so much.

01:46:55.379 --> 01:46:58.075
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

01:46:58.949 --> 01:47:00.382
- Red?
- Red?

01:47:00.551 --> 01:47:02.542
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.085
What's up, pal?

01:47:04.989 --> 01:47:06.479
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47:06.657 --> 01:47:10.354
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

01:47:10.528 --> 01:47:12.792
That's okay. We won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

01:47:12.963 --> 01:47:16.421
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's <i>bubbe.</i>

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.693
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:47:18.869 --> 01:47:20.803
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

01:47:20.971 --> 01:47:23.064
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.174
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

01:47:25.342 --> 01:47:27.606
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

01:47:27.778 --> 01:47:29.837
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

01:47:30.014 --> 01:47:33.040
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

01:47:33.217 --> 01:47:35.082
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

01:47:35.252 --> 01:47:36.844
Blood from my ear just...

01:47:37.021 --> 01:47:39.819
You guys smell like shit.

01:47:41.025 --> 01:47:43.687
You are in serious danger.

01:49:43.688 --> 01:49:44.688
