WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.836
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.006 --> 00:10.716
The destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.804
His name: Merlin.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.880
I was hoping
for more of a challenge.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.133
There was a time
when the name alator

00:57.307 --> 00:59.263
struck fear into even
the most courageous.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.343
His skills of torture was unparalleled.
Did you know that?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.558
That was nothing to be proud of.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.766
What was it you used to say?

01:09.361 --> 01:11.852
The victim always talks...

01:13.073 --> 01:15.155
- Eventually.
- What do you want from me?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.407
I would have thought
that was obvious.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.234
I want you to tell me
where emrys is.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.990
I told you before.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.328
Never.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.042
I was rather hoping
you'd say that.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.459
This really is the most perfect spot,
is it not?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.005
It is, my lord.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.207
I sometimes forget
how beautiful Camelot is.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.676
Guinevere: Mmm.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.382
But never how
beautiful my queen is.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.393
Was that you, Merlin?

02:24.603 --> 02:25.638
It was the horse.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.765
Because if you were mocking your king...

02:27.939 --> 02:29.224
I wasn't. I wouldn't.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.983
There's a special punishment
reserved for such impudence.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.532
You're too easy, Merlin.
Every time.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.951
How about here, Guinevere?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.163
Yes, it looks perfect.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.325
Then here it shall be.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.911
Here?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.545
I haven't seen him this happy
in a long time.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.463
He has changed, hasn't he?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.510
Yeah

03:06.561 --> 03:07.926
yeah, I think he has.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.439
Sorry.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.847
Fill that up, will you, Merlin?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.939
Well, perhaps he's not totally changed.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.724
Arthur: And this one too, ready?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.114
Merlin: Sire.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.401
I think my dog can
catch better than you.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.782
Possibly because
you treat him better.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.377
Are you blind?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.134
Something happened here.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.136
It's stags marking their territory.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.930
No. This was caused by magic.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.968
Merlin, who knows more
about hunting, me or you?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.183
It's rutting season. Half the trees
in the forest look like that.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.232
Come on, your king awaits.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.295
What happened?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.552
They sought sanctuary
at the western Garrison.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.175
Ashwick's been at peace
since my father's time.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.089
Leon: They're not from ashwick.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.384
They fled over the border
from Odin's lands.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.642
Leon: Two days ago,
the city of helva was attacked.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.649
Only a handful of people
managed to escape.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.979
Who is responsible?

04:39.154 --> 04:41.145
At first, we assumed
it was the saxons.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.776
They've been active
in that area before

04:43.992 --> 04:46.324
but the refugees
tell a different story.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.986
They say magic was involved.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.290
Morgana?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.300
Leon: All the evidence
would suggest so, sire.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.826
Strengthen the Garrison.
Double the patrol on the border.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.084
Sire.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.132
Why would morgana attack helva?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.509
She must have her reasons.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.965
That's one of the places
where magic is practiced freely.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.380
Why would she attack her own?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.011
Makes no sense.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.677
Gaius:
The workmanship is undeniable.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.014
See how the pattern repeats
in each concentric circle.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.899
- It's made in helva.
- Anything else? Name or date?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.560
Not that I can see.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.486
It's a fine piece.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.908
No one would part with it willingly.
Perhaps one of the refugees dropped it.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.492
Hmm.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.031
Perhaps.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.952
- Merlin, what are you up to?
- I'm going back to where I found it.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.741
Doubt if the owner will still be there.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.911
Well, something terrible
happened there, Gaius.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.205
Something only the strongest
magic could do.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.418
I could feel it.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.925
You're not suggesting that morgana's
within Camelot's borders?

05:46.137 --> 05:47.172
Who else could it be?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.005
Don't go, Merlin. Not on your own.
“I'll be fine.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.639
Take someone with you at least.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.163
- If it is morgana...
- Then it won't make any difference...

05:54.187 --> 05:55.723
Who I take, will it?

07:22.692 --> 07:23.932
Gaius: You shouldn't have gone.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.190
It might have been a trap.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.153
Can you decipher it?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.155
It's in catha, that's for sure.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.326
What does it say?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.402
It's so long since I heard the language,
never mind read it.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.405
There's part of a signature here.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.624
What is it?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.876
Alator.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.248
That's why morgana attacked helva.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.509
Alator was the prize
she was after.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.045
But why risk
so much for one man?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.672
It can only be one reason:

07:55.934 --> 07:58.391
To have him reveal who emrys is.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.635
Alator would never betray me.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.520
Not willingly.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.686
But morgana will use
every power she has to break him...

08:05.860 --> 08:08.272
And even cathas cannot
resist forever.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.203
Enough.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.666
Hello again, alator.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.081
You're wasting your time, morgana.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.549
I will not tell you who emrys is.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.506
We both know that's not true.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.342
Otherwise why would I
have spared your life?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.388
I am a catha

08:40.645 --> 08:42.385
trained from birth _.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.680
To master all physical pain...

08:44.941 --> 08:46.431
- To rise above...
- Yes, yes.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.858
You can resist any physical torture...

08:49.029 --> 08:51.315
Separate your mind from your body.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.070
That's all very impressive, alator.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.866
But you see, it's not your body
I'm interested in.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.491
Not even you can separate
your mind from your mind.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.541
Do you recognize this?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.219
I see that you do.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.474
- A nathair.
- That's right, alator.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.225
A nathair.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.267
Can cause the most
exquisite pain...

09:30.487 --> 09:33.399
Not in the body of the victim,
but in his very soul.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.448
So I ask you again,
where is emrys?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.698
Arthur: Shh.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.624
What are you doing?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.037
I'm gonna surprise her.
Breakfast in bed.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.044
Oh. What a lovely thought.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.176
Where are you going?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.219
You don't need me, do you?

09:59.390 --> 10:01.381
I can't very well go and
get the breakfast, can 1?

10:01.559 --> 10:04.426
What if she wakes up
and... panics?

10:05.688 --> 10:06.688
Panics?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.596
Look, just go and get it, all right?

10:12.821 --> 10:13.981
Merlin?

10:14.322 --> 10:15.778
Flowers.
Don't forget the flowers.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.230
Of course. The personal touch.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.902
Nice. Yeah

10:52.861 --> 10:54.021
Be still.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.562
The great battle is nearing.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.573
You must listen to me, emrys.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.324
How do you know my name?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.823
Arthur's enemies are closer
than you think.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.656
If you value your king...

11:08.376 --> 11:10.162
Meet me tonight at
the old temple of erui.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.869
Come alone.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.417
Or not at all

11:33.818 --> 11:35.649
Merlin! “What?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.560
Where are the flowers?

11:44.662 --> 11:45.777
Arthur.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.286
Good morning.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.872
- That is so sweet.
- It's nothing.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.414
Who's there?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.381
Merlin. What do you think you're doing...

11:59.219 --> 12:00.675
In the royal chambers?

12:00.929 --> 12:01.929
I thought, um...

12:02.305 --> 12:03.920
I heard voices.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.938
Maybe next time you'll
be good enough to knock.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.306
Yes, sire.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.181
Merlin?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.312
Thank you.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.320
It was my idea.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.372
If it's what I think it is,
this is the Mark of the bendrui.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.629
Bendrui?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.879
Before the time of the great purge...

12:38.049 --> 12:40.916
Girls would be chosen at birth
for the priesthood.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.678
They'd be taken away from their families and
brought up as initiates in the old religion.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.883
I thought morgana was
the only high priestess left.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.720
Many tried, few succeeded...

12:49.894 --> 12:51.885
For ordinary gifts were not enough.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.226
For only those possessed
of exceptional magical power...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.641
Could ever hope to
be one of the nine.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.193
But do not underestimate
this woman's abilities.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.239
All bendrui are practiced
and potent magic.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.650
She said.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.444
Arthur's enemies were
closer than I thought.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.955
Now, who else could
she mean but mordred?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.162
If she meant mordred, why not say so?

13:15.837 --> 13:17.043
We were interrupted.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.329
She's drawing you in, Merlin.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.917
It's a trap.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.258
She knew your real name.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.552
There's only one explanation for that:

13:26.723 --> 13:30.466
Alator told morgana who you really are...

13:30.643 --> 13:32.804
And she has sent this woman.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.970
To lure you to her.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.731
But I looked into her eyes.
She meant no harm.

13:38.901 --> 13:43.019
You think a sorceress of her power
couldn't feign any look she wished?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.108
I was there, Gaius.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.773
You were not.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.566
You mustn't go to her, Merlin.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.827
She can help me protect Arthur.
Do I have a choice?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.077
Don't you understand?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.330
If something happened to you,
we would all be lost.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.334
But if she can truly help me
protect Arthur from mordred...

13:58.504 --> 13:59.960
And I refuse to go...

14:00.131 --> 14:01.541
Would all not be lost then too?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.464
Merlin

14:08.723 --> 14:11.510
it was I who told alator.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.593
Your true identity.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.812
You had no choice.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.314
And I cannot let that destroy you.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.320
If ever you held me
in any regard...

14:27.533 --> 14:30.366
Please do not do this.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.156
You know I'd never do
anything to hurt you, Gaius.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.119
Thank you.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.149
Morgana pendragon.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.126
Yes?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.671
(Saius.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.889
Sire.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.680
Is something wrong?

15:38.688 --> 15:39.848
I fear so.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.439
Come, Gaius.
You obviously have something to tell me.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.395
There'll be no secrets between us.

15:45.611 --> 15:50.275
There is a special bond
between a doctor and his patient...

15:50.575 --> 15:54.614
One might almost say
a bond of sacred confidentiality.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.197
I believe so.

15:56.456 --> 16:01.325
And yet, is there not also a loyal bond
between a subject and his king?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.245
There can be no greater duty.

16:09.177 --> 16:12.635
A patient has advised me
that within the walls of Camelot

16:12.889 --> 16:15.380
there is a follower of the old religion.

16:16.309 --> 16:21.019
It is my belief that this woman
poses a threat not only to the kingdom...

16:21.731 --> 16:23.312
But to you yourself.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.727
I see.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.067
Does she have a name?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.905
All I know is...

16:33.326 --> 16:36.284
She practices her craft at night...

16:37.205 --> 16:41.323
In the darkling woods
by the ruined temple of erui.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.038
You did the right thing, Gaius.
Thank you.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.549
Mordred: It's not funny.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.051
Percival: It's not funny at all.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.186
Mordred:
No one is laughing. It's just childish.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.840
You're right. It's stupid.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.220
Here

17:04.857 --> 17:05.857
Arthur: Gentlemen.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.602
Oh, we were just...

17:07.777 --> 17:09.017
No matter.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.651
Mordred.
I've got a task for you.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.031
Your favorite.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.798
Do you not want it”?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.171
No, of course I do.
Thank you, Gaius.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.721
You're not still thinking about
that woman in the forest, are you?

17:43.354 --> 17:45.390
It's for the best, Merlin.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.814
Really. It is.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.182
- Great one.
- Please, that's not necessary.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.136
It is an honor to meet you, emrys.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.729
How did you know my name?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.099
From my master, alator of the catha.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.142
He sends you greetings.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.398
But also a warning.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.357
The great battle nears.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.994
The fate of Camelot
rests in the balance.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.497
Only you, great emrys...

19:28.668 --> 19:32.001
Can ensure the triumph of
the once and future king.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.829
How do I do that?

19:36.217 --> 19:37.423
Quickly.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.294
Seize them!

19:55.111 --> 19:57.443
- Go.
- Ll cannot leave you.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.024
Unh!

20:03.911 --> 20:06.027
I'll find you.
You have my word. Go.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.517
Arthur:
You saw her, but you lost her?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.023
She used magic, sire.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.401
Even so, there are
how many of you, six?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.982
- Against one old woman?
- There were two of them, sire.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.443
Oh, well, that explains it.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.275
Mordred, who was the other?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.325
We couldn't see

21:31.791 --> 21:34.658
but they were in earnest conversation,
sire. That much we could tell

21:34.877 --> 21:36.742
all right, send out a second patrol.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.996
Seal off the Ford at greinton
and alert the border garrisons.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.085
They must be found and brought to trial.

21:42.593 --> 21:43.878
Sire.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.883
Gaius: I told Arthur
because I was worried about you, Merlin.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.469
She was working for alator,
not morgana.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.644
- How was I to know that?
- Because I told you.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.113
I'm sorry, Merlin.
I thought it was for the best.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.189
Now, because of me,
her life's in danger.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.570
No

22:05.407 --> 22:06.897
Not you.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.117
Me

22:09.036 --> 22:11.493
I acted like a foolish old man.

22:12.623 --> 22:13.908
No, never that.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.791
But I have to go now.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.506
I must find out
why she would risk her life for me.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.554
Take care, Merlin.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.952
You continue to waste
your time, morgana.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.038
I am a catha priest.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.922
And you think that will protect you?

23:06.093 --> 23:08.459
No matter what you do...

23:09.054 --> 23:10.339
You cannot break me.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.552
So it would seem

23:14.685 --> 23:16.425
in which case I have
no further use for you.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.185
You think I fear death?

23:18.355 --> 23:20.596
Shall I let you into
a secret, alator?

23:21.525 --> 23:25.063
I'm no longer interested
in what you think or what you fear.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.523
I shall pass to the other world...

23:28.616 --> 23:34.031
Happy in the knowledge
that you will never find emrys.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.113
He is your destiny, morgana.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.700
And he is your doom.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.708
Mistress.

23:46.884 --> 23:47.884
What now?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.628
We found a letter in his cell

23:50.888 --> 23:52.344
show me.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.939
"Do not fear, alator,
I have found emrys.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.937
Our sacred mission continues.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.647
Your faithful servant, finna."

24:09.615 --> 24:11.480
You poor fool, alator.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.401
Undone by a few scribbled words.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.118
Find this finna.
Bring her to me. Alive.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.123
I will break her, alator.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.591
Break her like a twig.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.262
How does it feel to know
all your resistance was for nothing?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.471
Enjoy your other world.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.038
Leon: Herbs?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.165
You were looking for herbs?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.205
(Gaius is very particular.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.305
They have to be fresh
or the power's diminished.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.630
Hardly the time and the place
to be gathering herbs.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.172
You were grateful enough for them
when Gaius cured your palsy.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.767
- It wasn't palsy.
- I was being polite.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.273
There's a dangerous
sorcerer at large, Merlin.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.100
Not to mention saxons.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.810
This is not the place to be alone.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.944
I'll be fine. I'll just...

26:57.199 --> 26:59.531
Collect the rest of my herbs
and I'll be on my way.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.700
No

27:04.373 --> 27:05.829
All right.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.782
I'll head back.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.623
We can't allow that either.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.458
Gwaine:
You're staying with us, Merlin.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.293
Until the sorcerer's apprehended.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.797
Well, thank you.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.726
- What news?
- The hounds have picked up the woman's trail.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.012
- How far?
- L. Ess than a mile.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.320
We've lost her.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.492
Should we split up?
Some of us track back.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.620
It's getting dark.
We'll be sitting targets for the saxons.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.785
We'll start again
at first light.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.324
Good morning.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.831
Though technically,
I think it's still night.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.756
- I was just going for a...
- Relieving yourself?

28:34.880 --> 28:35.995
Yeah

28:36.798 --> 28:39.460
you always put your boots on
to do that, do you?

28:39.635 --> 28:40.750
I don't like splinters.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.215
You weren't collecting
herbs either, were you?

28:44.431 --> 28:46.513
You don't have to explain
yourself to me, Merlin.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.259
If you're willing to risk your life,
it must be important.

28:52.648 --> 28:53.728
It is

28:56.568 --> 28:58.308
a problem shared.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.650
I understand.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.453
I'll tell them I escorted you
back to the bridge.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.161
Thank you.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.078
Merlin?

29:20.217 --> 29:21.548
Be careful.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.362
We've lost the trail.
She could have gone anywhere.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.327
Fan out.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.419
Wait

30:23.989 --> 30:25.354
This way.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.168
Finna.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.708
Oh, master.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.675
Please don't.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.465
I thought I'd lost you.

30:49.723 --> 30:50.758
You doubted me?

30:51.308 --> 30:52.798
Never.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.643
Aah!

31:13.288 --> 31:14.368
Lie back.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.409
They won't be alone.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.583
Morgana must not find you.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.805
Merlin: Where can we go?

31:34.017 --> 31:36.633
There's an old watchtower on
the other side of the valley.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.428
Can you walk?

31:41.650 --> 31:44.016
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.101
It's not far.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.577
It's safe. You ready?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.207
Yeah

32:20.522 --> 32:21.807
There are no wounds.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.222
There wouldn't be.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.113
She's been hit.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.123
Bring your men.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.439
How do you know this tower?

33:06.943 --> 33:09.059
When you've spent a lifetime running...

33:09.237 --> 33:11.023
You know all the places to hide.

33:11.198 --> 33:14.190
Running from... Arthur?

33:14.367 --> 33:16.028
And from his father before him.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.861
Oh.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.830
It won't always be like this.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.747
Things will be better.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.958
That is why I was sent...

33:47.234 --> 33:49.190
Why are you doing this for me?

33:49.903 --> 33:54.988
Without you, emrys, Arthur cannot
build a new world we all long for.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.823
I don't understand.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.531
For hundreds of years, the catha
have guarded their ancient knowledge.

34:00.705 --> 34:04.994
But now the time has come
to pass it on to you, emrys.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.956
For only you can carry their hopes
into the great battle itself.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.415
How can I do that?

34:17.347 --> 34:18.347
Here

34:18.806 --> 34:21.139
guard it carefully.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.762
It will help you
in the dark days to come.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.469
Thank you.

34:28.190 --> 34:30.898
I want her taken alive,
do you understand? Alive.

34:36.491 --> 34:40.234
There is something else, something
alator himself wanted me to tell you.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.949
Do not make the same mistake as Arthur.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.659
Do not trust the druid boy.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.801
You must go on.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.890
- There's nowhere to go.
- There is a roof.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.804
- You will be safe there.
- How?

35:09.983 --> 35:11.644
They think I am alone.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.268
Once they have me, they will go.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.938
I won't leave you, finna.
We fight them together.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.231
No

35:19.451 --> 35:22.113
If morgana sees us together,
she will know who you are.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.322
That must never happen.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.863
- Finna, please.
- It is my destiny, emrys.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.082
To serve you until the end.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.038
I could wish for nothing more.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.630
Grant me one favor.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.629
- Anything.
- Leave me your sword.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.216
No

36:01.284 --> 36:03.616
It has been a privilege...

36:04.871 --> 36:06.907
To know you, emrys.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.314
Finna.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.531
At last.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.530
I'm impressed.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.237
Your age, it's very spirited.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.526
Stay away.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.319
But with age also comes wisdom.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.529
It's over.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.865
Tell me who emrys is.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.118
Never.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.197
Burn the body.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.200
(Set the horses!

38:56.709 --> 38:57.994
Thank you.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.460
It is my pleasure.

39:07.053 --> 39:10.011
For a second there,
I thought you weren't coming.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.761
I would never forsake you,
young warlock.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.104
Merlin: You all right?

39:20.275 --> 39:21.310
Of course.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.186
Your wing.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.900
I am tired, emrys. That is all

39:32.453 --> 39:36.241
but I shall serve you as long
as I have the strength.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.247
If you're ill, I can heal you.

39:38.626 --> 39:43.962
There are some things even a warlock
as great as you cannot overcome.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.461
I am old, emrys.

39:47.844 --> 39:50.301
My time has almost come.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.969
No

39:52.140 --> 39:57.100
It is the cycle of life. No more, no less.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.230
What will I do without you?

40:03.902 --> 40:06.234
You will remember me.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.238
Will I see you again?

40:52.075 --> 40:53.656
What does it say?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.408
Just a moment.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.618
"I et loose the hounds of war.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.327
And let the dread fire
of the last priestess...

41:05.922 --> 41:09.085
Rain down from angry skies...

41:09.842 --> 41:12.584
For brother will slaughter brother...

41:13.012 --> 41:15.719
For friend will murder friend.

41:16.224 --> 41:21.435
As the great horn sounds a cold dawn
at camlann.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.684
The prophets do not lie.

41:27.026 --> 41:30.610
There, Arthur will meet his end...

41:31.698 --> 41:35.361
Upon that mighty plain.”

41:49.257 --> 41:51.168
So many have...

41:52.218 --> 41:54.459
Suffered so that I may hear this.

41:55.471 --> 41:56.961
Yes

42:02.520 --> 42:05.262
I think I know what's going
through your mind, Merlin.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.808
That your destiny's almost too much
for one man to bear.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.357
Yeah

42:16.325 --> 42:18.862
you always did
know me best, Gaius.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.409
Be assured of one thing.

42:26.085 --> 42:30.294
There was never anyone
more capable than you, Merlin.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.415
You will not fail.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.724
We got here as fast as we could.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.525
You did well

42:52.737 --> 42:53.852
where did this happen?

42:54.155 --> 42:56.066
Well, we found him
just inside the border.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.697
Merlin, fetch my glass, please.

42:59.869 --> 43:01.951
- Do you know what it is?
- I fear so.

43:02.371 --> 43:06.034
The skin has grown across his face
until he suffocated.

43:16.844 --> 43:17.959
(Gaius?

43:18.137 --> 43:22.096
The disfigurement is not as a result
of disease or infection.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.473
It is the result of powerful magic.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.767
In the old days,
there was a punishment...

43:26.979 --> 43:28.389
Known as "ragaid"...

43:28.731 --> 43:31.768
The ultimate warning
from the high priestess...

43:31.984 --> 43:33.599
To her enemies.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.247
Why was this knight chosen?
What had he done?

43:36.405 --> 43:37.815
He'd done nothing...

43:38.074 --> 43:39.985
Except be a knight of Camelot.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.358
It's a warning, sire.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.989
A warning to the whole kingdom.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.662
Morgana has declared war.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.383
You know if Arthur catches her,
she'll be killed.

44:18.239 --> 44:21.606
This time you've gone too far.
You'll pay, Merlin.
