IT FEELS RANDOM.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.458
LIKE, LAST WEEK,
MY WIFE WOULDN'T SHUT UP

THIS GUY AT WORK.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.500
HE ALWAYS TAKES
THE LAST COLD SODA.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.208

07:28.250 --> 07:30.709

IT UP AND JUST PUT IT IN THERE.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.917

07:31.959 --> 07:34.875

07:34.917 --> 07:39.166

WHAT I DID WAS WRONG, BUT--

07:39.208 --> 07:41.667
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO FEEL
WHATEVER YOU FEEL.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.000
IT IS NOT ALL RIGHT TO BEHAVE
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO BEHAVE.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.667

SOME TRICKS I CAN USE?

07:46.709 --> 07:50.041
LIKE, MY BROTHER RICKY--HE TRIED
HYPNOSIS TO QUIT SMOKING.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.917
WELL, ANGER
DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WAY.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.291
IT'S NOT A HABIT.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.000
SO IN ORDER TO HELP YOU,

07:55.041 --> 07:56.542
WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW
THE UNDERLYING CAUSES.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.250
SOME PEOPLE GET ANGRY
WHEN THEY FEEL

07:58.291 --> 07:59.667
THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN
WHAT THEY DESERVE.

07:59.709 --> 08:02.542
FOR OTHERS, IT COMES
FROM FEAR OR VULNERABILITY.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.333
GUILT CAN ALSO BE A TRIGGER.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.250

08:19.041 --> 08:20.583

IS PROTECTED

RELATIONSHIP.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.750

08:24.792 --> 08:26.041

08:26.083 --> 08:28.375
OR IF YOU ARE PLANNING
TO COMMIT A CRIME.

08:28.417 --> 08:31.041

08:31.083 --> 08:32.208

08:32.250 --> 08:34.041

IT'S OKAY.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.792
WHAT IS IT? WHAT HAPPENED?

08:47.041 --> 08:50.166
11 YEARS AGO, I SHOT SOMEONE.

08:50.208 --> 08:52.000
OKAY?

08:52.041 --> 08:53.542
I SHOT SOMEONE.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.750
OUR DAUGHTER, JENNY,
SHE WAS 21,

08:59.792 --> 09:02.792
JUST FINISHED COLLEGE, AND SHE
WAS BACKPACKING ACROSS EUROPE,

09:02.834 --> 09:04.750
AND SHE HAD ONE MORE WEEK.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.542
SO I CALLED, LEFT A MESSAGE.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.041
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO A VOICE MAIL?

09:08.083 --> 09:11.125
SO I, UH,
I TOLD HER TO CALL ME,

09:11.166 --> 09:14.041
AND, UH, SHE DID...

09:14.083 --> 09:15.625
FROM THE MOULIN ROUGE.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.000
AND SHE WAS SO EXCITED,

09:18.041 --> 09:19.667
JUST GOING ON AND ON,

09:19.709 --> 09:21.667
AND WHEN SHE SAID,
"HOW ARE YOU?"

09:21.709 --> 09:24.667
I COULDN'T TELL HER.
I-I COULDN'T DO IT.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.083
SO I SAID--
AND THIS JUST CAME OUT--

09:26.125 --> 09:28.208
I SAID,
"TRACEY WAS IN THE SHOWER."

09:28.250 --> 09:31.583
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST A KID,

09:31.625 --> 09:34.417
AND THOSE FOUR WORDS--
"YOUR MOTHER IS DEAD"...

09:36.208 --> 09:38.417
THEY WERE GONNA
CHANGE HER LIFE FOREVER,

09:38.458 --> 09:41.083
SO IF I COULD GIVE HER
ONE MORE WEEK...

09:44.250 --> 09:46.000
WHY NOT?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
WHO DID YOU SHOOT?

09:57.083 --> 09:58.333
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.083
I WAS 18.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.709
A STUPID KID.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.083
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,

10:03.125 --> 10:04.625
BACK THEN, IT WAS JUST ME
AND MY BABY BROTHER GROWING UP.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.291
WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT DADS
WHO WE NEVER MET.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.250
OUR MOM--SHE BAILED.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.625
WE HAD NOTHING.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.542
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU
SAW YOUR BABY BROTHER HUNGRY,

10:12.583 --> 10:14.458
CRYING, COLD?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.750
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.583
UM...

10:22.625 --> 10:24.083
IT WAS, UH...

10:26.417 --> 10:27.959
IT WAS SUPER BOWL.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.375
A GUY CAME OUT OF THIS
FANCY ITALIAN JOINT ON PICO.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.375
LOOK, RICKY WAS 13.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.875
HE WAS ALL BONES, NO COAT.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.917
HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

10:38.959 --> 10:42.000
SO I GOT A GUN. I WASN'T
PLANNING ON SHOOTING IT.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.291
IT WAS JUST TO...

10:45.333 --> 10:49.750
LOOK, I JUST NEEDED TO GET US
SOME MONEY, SOME FOOD.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.125
SO IT WAS A ROBBERY?

10:52.583 --> 10:56.125
IF I COULD GO BACK
AND CHANGE IT...

10:58.083 --> 11:00.291
BUT THE GUY--
HE WOULDN'T GIVE ME HIS MONEY.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.875
HE LUNGED AT ME, AND I PANICKED,
AND THE GUN WENT OFF.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.291
AND THEN I RAN.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.041
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GUY YOU SHOT?

11:10.083 --> 11:13.166
I DON'T KNOW

11:13.208 --> 11:15.208
AND I DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.792
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:18.834 --> 11:21.750
DRESS THE WOUND,
THEN GET AN X-RAY.

11:21.792 --> 11:25.208
(indistinct conversations)

11:25.250 --> 11:26.333
HI.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.834
HI.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.083
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO HAVE LUNCH

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
WITH ME TODAY, BUT I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ATE.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.041
THANKS.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.792
SANDWICH
WITH A SIDE OF BROCCOLI--

11:33.834 --> 11:35.166
JAMMED WITH NUTRIENTS--

11:35.208 --> 11:38.000
AND ALSO TWO KINDS OF SOUP--
LENTILS AND CHICKEN NOODLE.

11:38.041 --> 11:40.208
LENTILS ARE GREAT. THEY GOT
IRON, THEY GOT FOLIC ACID,

11:40.250 --> 11:41.542
THEY GOT PROTEIN,
AND, YOU KNOW,

11:41.583 --> 11:43.208
CHICKEN SOUP HAS SUSTAINED
MY PEOPLE FOR CENTURIES.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.000
THANK YOU.
THERE'S ALSO A PLUM,

11:45.041 --> 11:46.333
WHICH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE,

11:46.375 --> 11:49.041
BUT IN A SYMBOLIC
POINT OF VIEW,

11:49.083 --> 11:51.458
YOU KNOW THAT THE COOPLETTES ARE
THE SIZE OF PLUMS RIGHT NOW?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.625
NOW THAT YOU COULD TELL WITH YOU
SINCE YOU'RE BARELY SHOWING.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.041
WHERE'S THE ON-CALL
ORAL SURGEON?

11:55.083 --> 11:56.667
WE PAGED DR. WALKER TWICE.

11:56.709 --> 11:57.875
WELL, THEN PAGE HIM AGAIN

11:57.917 --> 11:59.250
AND GET THIS GUY
AN ABDOMINAL C.T.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.834
ASK ME HOW I KNOW THAT.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.208
WHAT?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.500
HOW THE COOPLETTES ARE
THE SIZE OF PLUMS.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.458
HONEY, I--

12:06.500 --> 12:08.041
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

12:08.083 --> 12:10.667
THERE'S AN APP FOR IT.
I DOWNLOADED IT THIS MORNING.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.041
SENDS YOU ALL SORTS OF
INFORMATION ABOUT THE BABIES,

12:13.083 --> 12:14.375
ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.291
IN TWO WEEKS, THEY'RE GONNA BE
THE SIZE OF AVOCADOS.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.709
OH, THEN YOU'LL BRING ME
SOME GUACAMOLE.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.792
I'M REALLY BUSY HERE, COOP.
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.291
YOU'VE BEEN PULLING
SHIFTS AT THE E.R. FOR MONTHS.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.500
JUST HIRE SOMEONE.

12:23.542 --> 12:24.917
I CAN'T HIRE JUST ANYONE.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.500
IT TAKES TIME TO FIND
THE RIGHT PERSON.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.041
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE BEING
OVERLY PICKY,

12:28.083 --> 12:30.041
AND YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS UP,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.375
ESPECIALLY NOW.

12:31.417 --> 12:36.041
THE PLUMS NEED YOU
OFF YOUR FEET.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.667
I HAVE TO GO.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.458
I BROUGHT YOU AN ICED TEA
FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.041
THANK YOU.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.458
SO HOW'S IT FEEL
BEING BACK AT WORK?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.250
AH, WORK KEEPS ME BUSY.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.208
IT'S HELPFUL TO FEEL HELPFUL,
YOU KNOW?

12:55.250 --> 12:56.250
YEAH.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.542
MY PATIENT HAD AN IMPORTANT
BREAKTHROUGH TODAY.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.333
IT'S A--IT'S A TRICKY ONE.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.875
HE DID SOMETHING
WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.208
HE SHOT A MAN.
HE FLED THE SCENE.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.041
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
DOES HE WANT TO KNOW?

13:07.083 --> 13:08.208
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T,

13:08.250 --> 13:09.458
BUT THE GUILT IS
EATING HIM ALIVE.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.959
I MEAN, MAYBE HE DOES WANT
TO KNOW, BUT--BUT HIS DENIAL--

13:12.000 --> 13:14.709
NO. NO. YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST,
NOT A DETECTIVE.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.458
WELL, NO, I DIDN'T SAY--
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.041
YOUR PATIENT DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO RESEARCH THIS,

13:19.083 --> 13:21.542
AND GOING BEHIND HIS BACK IS
A BETRAYAL OF HIS TRUST,

13:21.583 --> 13:22.959
AND WITHOUT THAT TRUST,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.041
THE PATIENT CAN NO LONGER
ENGAGE IN THERAPY,

13:24.083 --> 13:25.375
AND--AND YOU CAN'T HELP HIM.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.750
BUT WHAT IF THE MAN
IS STILL ALIVE?

13:26.792 --> 13:28.250
I MEAN, IF IT'S GOOD NEWS,

13:28.291 --> 13:30.166
I COULD TELL HIM, AND A HUGE
BURDEN WOULD BE LIFTED.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.625
YEAH, WHAT IF IT
ISN'T GOOD NEWS?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.542
WHAT IF YOUR PATIENT IS,
IN FACT, A MURDERER? WHAT THEN?

13:33.583 --> 13:35.083
YOU--YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
ABLE TO KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF?

13:35.125 --> 13:36.917
OF COURSE.
NO, I'M NOT SO SURE.

13:36.959 --> 13:38.959
IF HIS VICTIM IS DEAD,
YOU'RE GONNA JUDGE HIM.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.875
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW THAT
YOUR PATIENT IS A MURDERER,

13:40.917 --> 13:42.250
AND IT'S GONNA COLOR
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.041
IT'S A PANDORA'S BOX, VIOLET,

13:44.083 --> 13:46.041
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT YOURS TO OPEN.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.417
LEAVE IT ALONE.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.375
(knock on door)
HEY.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.083
WHAT'S WITH THE SMILE?

13:53.125 --> 13:54.417
LYDIA RIGGINS.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.542
18 MONTHS--THAT'S HOW LONG
WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.000
AND NOW SHE'S PREGNANT.

13:58.041 --> 13:59.208
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.625
YOU OKAY?

14:00.667 --> 14:02.959
YOU SURE?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.083
YOU DON'T REALLY SEEM OKAY.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.208
(sighs deeply)
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.083
I'M--I DON'T KNOW.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.208
I DON'T MEAN TO BE NOT OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.041
LOOK, A FRIEND DIED, AND IT'S--
IT'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.792
WELL, I WILL BE FINE.

14:16.834 --> 14:19.000
PEOPLE DIE ALL THE TIME,
YOU KNOW?

14:19.041 --> 14:21.125
I'VE LOST MY MOM,

14:21.166 --> 14:23.041
PETE, AND NOW MARK.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.041
IT'S WHAT IT IS.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.542
IT SEEMS LIKE MORE.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.041
NO.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
I GOTTA HEAD
TO THE BIRTHING SUITE.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.208
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO BRINGS LIFE INTO THE WORLD.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.125
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO TALK...

14:35.166 --> 14:38.750
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT BE A SAINT.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.208
THANK YOU.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.583
IT'S A TEAKETTLE.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.291
DOESN'T TELLING ME DEFEAT
THE PURPOSE OF WRAPPING IT?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.291
YEAH. I GUESS.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.291
WE THOUGHT IT'D BE
A PERFECT HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.041
OH, I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.250
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

15:02.291 --> 15:03.792
YEAH,
IT COMES IN OTHER COLORS.

15:03.834 --> 15:06.041
I MEAN, I SAID WE SHOULD GET
RED, AND CHARLOTTE WAS LIKE, NO.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.041
NO. NO. NO. I-I LOVE
THE KETTLE. IT'S PERFECT.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.667
OH.
I--

15:10.709 --> 15:14.041
UH, SUPPOSED THERE'S SOMEONE,
AND YOU WANT TO HELP THEM,

15:14.083 --> 15:16.250
BUT THEY CLAIM
THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.542
OH, IS IT--IS IT ADDISON?

15:18.709 --> 15:19.709
NO.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.041
NO? SAM? IS IT SAM?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.041
NO. NO. YOU DON'T KNOW THEM,
COOPER.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.041
OH, IT'S A PATIENT.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.333
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET I ASKED.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.417
HOW ARE YOU,

15:27.458 --> 15:30.667
YOU,
OF THE MIGHTY OLYMPIAN SPERM?

15:30.709 --> 15:33.041
AH. GOLD, SILVER...

15:33.083 --> 15:34.917
(high-pitched voice) AND BRONZE.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.333
(normal voice)
UM, I'D BE BETTER IF I SAW

15:37.375 --> 15:39.083
THE MOTHER OF MY SOON-TO-BE
CHILDREN A LITTLE BIT MORE.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.083
SHE'S PICKING UP ALL SORTS
OF SHIFTS IN THE E.R.,

15:41.125 --> 15:44.041
AND SHE'S JUST--SHE'S RUNNING
HERSELF INTO THE GROUND.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.667
WELL, SOMETIMES WORK CAN BE

15:45.709 --> 15:47.083
THE BEST WAY
TO OCCUPY YOUR MIND.

15:47.125 --> 15:50.041
FROM SOMETHING BAD.
THIS IS A GOOD TH--I MEAN--

15:50.083 --> 15:53.125
COOP. IN A YEAR, SHE'S GONE
FROM NOT BEING A MOTHER

15:53.166 --> 15:56.041
TO BEING A MOTHER
OF A 9 YEAR OLD AND 3 BABIES.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.041
THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE
FOR A NORMAL WOMAN,

15:58.083 --> 15:59.250
AND SHE'S CHARLOTTE.
I KNOW.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.291
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

16:01.333 --> 16:05.208
THERE'S A REASON THEY GIVE US
NINE MONTHS, YOU KNOW?

16:08.083 --> 16:10.041
(woman) ...AS TRAGEDY STRUCK
TONIGHT IN WEST L.A.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.458
43-YEAR-OLD KEVIN GLANVILLE
LEFT A SUPER BOWL PARTY EARLY

16:13.500 --> 16:15.041
AND WAS SHOT AND KILLED

16:15.083 --> 16:17.041
OUTSIDE THE FOUR-STAR PIERRO'S
ON PICO BOULEVARD.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.458
POLICE OFFICERS BELIEVE
THE MOTIVE WAS ROBBERY.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.458
AT THIS POINT,
THERE ARE NO SUSPECTS,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.291
BUT THE SEARCH CONTINUES
FOR ANY WITNESSES.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.291
GLANVILLE IS SURVIVED
BY HIS WIFE ELYSE

16:25.333 --> 16:27.291
AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN,
BRADY AND LENA,

16:27.333 --> 16:30.041
AGES 7 AND 4.

16:37.625 --> 16:38.750
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH
TO TAKE CARE OF--

16:38.792 --> 16:41.333
THE BILLS, THE INSURANCE.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.375
I FORGOT TO CANCEL
HIS BlackBerry,

16:44.417 --> 16:45.625
AND ABOUT A WEEK AGO,

16:45.667 --> 16:47.750
THERE WAS A CALL FROM A NUMBER
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE,

16:47.792 --> 16:50.208
SO I CALLED BACK.

16:50.250 --> 16:53.041
SHE SAID SHE LOVED HIM.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.542
(sniffles)

16:54.583 --> 16:57.208
(crying) MY HUSBAND.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.041
TWO YEARS HE'D BEEN SEEING HER.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.083
(sniffles)

17:02.125 --> 17:05.375
I'M MOURNING HIS LOSS,

17:05.417 --> 17:07.041
BUT I HATE HIM.

17:08.625 --> 17:11.041
MY HUSBAND IS IN THE GROUND,

17:11.083 --> 17:13.166
COVERED IN DIRT,

17:13.208 --> 17:15.959
AND...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.250
I HATE HIM.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.792
(sniffles)

17:25.709 --> 17:27.208
CHAI TEA LATTE.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.166
AW. YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER.

17:29.208 --> 17:30.625
THANK YOU.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.792
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.792
NO POINT IN PUTTING IT OFF.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.667
WONDER WHAT SAW PALMETTO IS.

17:37.709 --> 17:38.917
DAMNED IF I KNOW.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.625
I WAS TALKING TO ONE
OF PETE'S PATIENTS EARLIER.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.792
SHE ASKED ME WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
IF SHE RUNS OUT OF MILK THISTLE.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.041
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

17:45.083 --> 17:47.709
TRY WHOLE FOODS.
(chuckles)

17:47.750 --> 17:49.458
YOU HOLDING UP OKAY?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT
GRIEF HAVING FIVE STAGES?

17:51.542 --> 17:53.917
THERE'S WAY MORE.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.500
HOW ABOUT YOU?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.375
I'M A...

17:57.417 --> 17:59.458
CHEATER.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.000
YOU CHEATED ON JAKE?

18:01.041 --> 18:04.041
MM. NOT PHYSICALLY,
BUT EMOTIONALLY.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.417
WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.500
MARK SLOAN.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.041
I MEAN, WE HADN'T SPOKEN
IN MONTHS,

18:09.083 --> 18:11.500
BUT I CAN'T--
I CAN'T STOP CRYING,

18:11.542 --> 18:13.250
YOU KNOW, AND THAT FEELS LIKE
CHEATING ON JAKE.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.458
ADDISON, THERE IS ROOM
TO MOURN SOMEBODY YOU LOVED

18:15.500 --> 18:17.041
AND STILL BE IN LOVE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

18:17.083 --> 18:20.041
YEAH, WELL, IT FEELS VERY
CROWDED INSIDE OF ME RIGHT NOW.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.625
WELL, MAYBE TALKING TO JAKE
WOULD HELP.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.458
(scoffs)
I HAVE A HISTORY, VIOLET,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.625
AND NOT JUST I DATED SOME GUYS
AND MADE SOME MISTAKES.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.834
I MEAN, I HAVE A HISTORY.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.750
JAKE DOESN'T KNOW
A LOT OF THINGS,

18:29.792 --> 18:32.041
AND I-I-I--
IF OPEN THAT DOOR, THEN--

18:32.083 --> 18:34.291
ADDISON, ANYONE YOU ENTER
INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH

18:34.333 --> 18:36.333
IS GONNA HAVE A HISTORY.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.041
YOU ARE YOUR PAST.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.291
OWN IT.

18:41.709 --> 18:43.917
(indistinct conversations)

18:43.959 --> 18:45.583
HEY, SEXY.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.750
THAT'S DR. BENNETT TO YOU.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.667
YOU WANT TO GRAB FOOD
TONIGHT?

18:52.709 --> 18:54.959
OH, I CAN'T TONIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
OH.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.333
OH? WHAT, OH?

18:57.375 --> 19:00.667
IT'S YOUR NIGHT WITH
THE OTHER WOMEN IN THE HAREM.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.041
WHAT?

19:02.083 --> 19:03.583
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I REALLY
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.542
OH, COME ON, STEPHANIE.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.750
SO IT'S JUST A DATE
WITH AN OLD FLAME THEN?

19:09.709 --> 19:11.750
YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.709
SAM, THAT WAS A JOKE.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.792
NOT A GOOD ONE, OBVIOUSLY.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.333
YEAH, RIGHT.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.041
COME ON. I WAS KIDDING.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.542
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA
GET BACK TO THE OFFICE.

19:20.583 --> 19:23.041
(clears throat)

19:23.083 --> 19:24.583
I HAVE TO SAY,

19:24.625 --> 19:27.041
SINCE, UH, TELLING YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.583
I'M JUST STARTING
TO FEEL BETTER.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.542
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT I DID
WAS WRONG,

19:31.583 --> 19:35.417
BUT JUST SAYING IT OUT LOUD,
I FEEL SO...

19:35.458 --> 19:36.834
(exhales) RELIEVED.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.041
I MEAN, IF I'D KNOWN
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED,

19:38.083 --> 19:40.417
I WOULD'VE BROUGHT IT UP
MUCH SOONER.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.750
DR. TURNER?

19:43.792 --> 19:45.625
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:45.667 --> 19:46.750
YEAH.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.917
IT'S...

19:48.959 --> 19:51.625
I'M--I'M--I'M JUST NOT FEELING
THAT WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN.

19:51.667 --> 19:52.625
DO YOU MIND IF WE CUT
OUR SESSION SHORT?

19:52.667 --> 19:55.000
YEAH. UM, COULD I MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

19:55.041 --> 19:56.542
FOR THE SAME TIME TOMORROW?
SURE.

19:56.583 --> 20:00.041
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY
STARTING TO GET SOMEWHERE.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:02.083 --> 20:04.000
I-I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.000
YOU DON'T BELONG
BACK AT WORK YET.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.458
YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.542
YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE CLOSURE WITH
THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR MARRIAGE,

20:11.583 --> 20:14.041
SO INSTEAD, YOU GO DIGGING
AROUND IN YOUR PATIENT'S PAST.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.792
WELL, MAYBE KNOWING THE TRUTH
COULD BRING HIM CLOSURE.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.041
MAYBE I SHOULD TELL HIM.
IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE,
AND IF YOU DO TELL HIM,

20:18.083 --> 20:20.041
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH
THE FACT THAT HE'S A MURDERER

20:20.083 --> 20:21.667
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
WELL,
HE ALWAYS WAS A MURDERER.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.166
HIS IGNORANCE
DIDN'T CHANGE THAT.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.625
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
IF HE KNOWS FOR SURE,

20:24.667 --> 20:26.834
MAYBE HE COULD DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.041
YOU CAME TO ME
BECAUSE YOU SCREWED UP.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.792
I KNOW!

20:31.834 --> 20:34.041
I KNOW.
I DID THE WRONG THING,

20:34.083 --> 20:36.083
AND NOW I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME TO FIX IT.

20:36.125 --> 20:39.375
I--IF I DON'T TELL HIM,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.041
WHAT DO I SAY?
HELP ME, SHELDON.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.041
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.
I KNOW.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.834
BUT IF I TELL HIM,
HE IS SCREWED.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.792
IF I DON'T TELL HIM,
I'M SCREWED.

20:47.834 --> 20:50.792
I--AH, DAMN IT.
I MEAN, ANY OTHER TIME, I--

20:50.834 --> 20:53.500
I'M OFF MY GAME.
OTHERWISE I WOULD NEVER...

20:55.417 --> 20:57.542
(cries) WHAT DO I DO?

20:58.959 --> 21:00.834
REFER HIM TO ANOTHER THERAPIST.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.709
YOU HAVE TO STOP
SEEING THIS PATIENT,

21:02.750 --> 21:04.750
SO JUST--JUST WALK AWAY,
VIOLET.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.625
TWO DOCTORS SAY
SHE'S BRAIN-DEAD,

21:19.667 --> 21:23.083
A THIRD SAYS, "MIRACLES HAPPEN.
DON'T GIVE UP."

21:23.125 --> 21:24.625
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS.

21:24.667 --> 21:28.208
IT'S SMALL. MINISCULE, EVEN.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.125
BUT IF I TAKE HER OFF
LIFE SUPPORT,

21:30.166 --> 21:33.125
WHAT IF SHE'S
IN THAT SMALL PERCENTAGE?

21:33.166 --> 21:35.792
WHAT IF THE NEXT DAY,
SHE WOULD'VE OPENED HER EYES?

21:35.834 --> 21:37.500
YOU HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

21:37.542 --> 21:39.375
PEOPLE JUST WAKE UP.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.667
AND SHE'S SUCH A FIGHTER.

21:41.709 --> 21:45.125
WE WENT ON THIS CLEANSE ONCE
FOR THREE WEEKS.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.792
DAY TWO, SHE COMES HOME

21:46.834 --> 21:49.709
AND CATCHES ME SCARFING DOWN
A BOX OF COOKIES.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.792
I MEAN, LITERALLY INHALING THEM.

21:52.834 --> 21:54.542
I WAS SO DONE.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.667
BUT SHE SAW IT THROUGH.

21:56.709 --> 22:02.041
SHE NEVER GIVES UP ON ANYTHING,

22:02.083 --> 22:04.917
SO HOW CAN I GIVE UP ON HER?

22:13.166 --> 22:15.166
THERE YOU ARE.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.834
JUST LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS
OF THE REAL OCEAN

22:20.875 --> 22:23.709
AND THE SOUNDS OF THE FAKE OCEAN
FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.959
IT'S VERY META.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.041
ADDISON, WHAT'S...

22:31.083 --> 22:33.625
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

22:33.667 --> 22:35.834
HAVE I
DONE SOMETHING WRONG OR--

22:35.875 --> 22:38.041
NO.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.458
NO. YOU--YOU HAVEN'T.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.417
YOU'RE--IT'S NOT... YOU.

22:44.792 --> 22:47.792
(exhales deeply)

22:50.291 --> 22:52.625
YOU ASKED ME
ABOUT MARK BEFORE.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.667
YEAH, BUT YOU CLEARLY DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM.

22:54.709 --> 22:57.333
I--IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST--I, UH,

22:57.375 --> 23:00.041
YOU LOOK AT ME RIGHT NOW--

23:00.083 --> 23:01.667
YOU HAVE THIS WAY
OF LOOKING AT ME.

23:01.709 --> 23:05.875
IT'S VERY HONEST AND OPEN,
AND I'M AFRAID IF I...

23:05.917 --> 23:08.542
(sighs)

23:08.583 --> 23:10.417
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT ME DIFFERENTLY.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.250
WHY WOULD I LOOK AT YOU
DIFFERENTLY?

23:13.291 --> 23:14.583
OKAY.
CAN WE NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW?

23:14.625 --> 23:16.417
I-I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
NO, ADDISON. STOP.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.083
JUST STOP. ALL RIGHT?
WILL YOU SIT DOWN, PLEASE?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.041
I'VE TRIED NOT TO PUSH.
I'VE GIVEN YOU PLENTY OF SPACE

23:20.083 --> 23:22.208

27:52.083 --> 27:54.083
YEAH.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.125
LISTEN, I-I KNOW THIS
MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE WEIRD,

27:56.166 --> 27:58.041
BUT CAN YOU...

27:58.083 --> 27:59.375
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

27:59.417 --> 28:00.709
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

28:00.750 --> 28:03.041

28:24.792 --> 28:26.625
HOPING THAT IT'S NOT REAL.

28:26.667 --> 28:30.750
(crying) HE WAS 26 YEARS OLD.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.250

BETWEEN HIM AND PETE,
I'M SAD ALL THE TIME,

29:02.959 --> 29:04.041
AND IT'S PROBABLY
NOT THE BEST THING

29:04.083 --> 29:06.041
TO BE HIDING IN THE BATHROOM
CRYING.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.041
SO DON'T HIDE.

29:07.083 --> 29:10.166
JUST TALK ABOUT IT.

29:10.208 --> 29:13.041
ARE YOU SAYING
I CAN TALK TO YOU?

29:13.083 --> 29:15.917
I'M SAYING YOU COULD TALK...

29:15.959 --> 29:19.041
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND ABOUT IT.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.959
REALLY, SAM?

LOOK, NOT TELLING JAKE
ABOUT MARK,

29:22.959 --> 29:24.291
ADDISON,
THAT'S--THAT'S A PROBLEM.

29:24.333 --> 29:25.667
OKAY. THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

29:25.709 --> 29:27.458
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT ISN'T ANY OF MY BUSINESS,

29:27.500 --> 29:29.542
BUT JAKE IS MAKING IT
MY BUSINESS.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.125
WHAT?
YOU KEEP DOING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

29:32.166 --> 29:33.458
OKAY, WE BOTH SCREWED UP
OUR RELATIONSHIPS, SAM.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.709
YES, WE BOTH HAVE SCREWED UP
ALL OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS,

29:35.750 --> 29:37.250
WHICH IS WHY I'M TELLING YOU

29:37.291 --> 29:38.917

MY PREGNANT WIFE
DOESN'T COME HOME?

30:04.625 --> 30:06.291
OH, YOU KNEW I WAS WORKING.

30:06.333 --> 30:08.875
YES, I DID, WHICH IS WHY
WHEN YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY TEXTS,

30:08.917 --> 30:10.792
I CALLED THE ADMIT DESK
EVERY HOUR

30:10.834 --> 30:12.166
TO MAKE SURE
SOMEONE HAD SEEN YOU ALIVE.

30:12.208 --> 30:15.083
ONLY HALF AN HOUR AGO,
NOBODY COULD FIND YOU,

30:15.125 --> 30:18.125
SO I MADE THEM SEARCH,
AND THEN I RAN OVER HERE,

30:18.166 --> 30:20.000
WONDERING IF YOU WERE DEAD.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.583
(groans)
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

30:21.625 --> 30:24.041
IT'S MY FEET. IT'S JUST
THESE DAMN SHOES. I'M FINE.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.208
YOU'RE NOT FINE. CHARLOTTE!

30:26.250 --> 30:28.333
YOU ARE NOT FINE.

30:28.375 --> 30:30.041
DO YOU KNOW THAT PETE
WENT RUNNING,

30:30.083 --> 30:31.291
AND NO ONE COULD FIND HIM,
AND HE WAS DEAD,

30:31.333 --> 30:33.041
THAT YOU WERE HERE
LATE ONE NIGHT

30:33.083 --> 30:35.208
AND SOMEBODY ATTACKED YOU
IN YOUR OWN OFFICE?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.208
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT YOU.

30:37.250 --> 30:40.375
I'M SUPPOSED TO PROTECT
OUR CHILDREN. THAT IS MY JOB.

30:40.417 --> 30:43.083
AND I CAN'T DO IT
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ME.

30:43.125 --> 30:46.041
YOU ARE NOT FINE,

30:46.083 --> 30:47.834
SO I'M NOT FINE.

30:53.834 --> 30:57.333
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE,

30:57.375 --> 30:59.125
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
THE BIOPSY DONE HERE,

30:59.166 --> 31:00.458
THERE ARE OTHER DOCTORS
I CAN REFER YOU TO.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.583
MY FATHER HAD
PROSTATE CANCER.

31:04.792 --> 31:07.125
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOUR, UH,

31:07.166 --> 31:09.000
YOUR FAMILY HISTORY
WAS ONE OF THE REASONS

31:09.041 --> 31:10.792
WHY I-I RAN THE TEST.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.041
BUT THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY--

31:12.083 --> 31:13.625
MY FATHER HAD
PROSTATE CANCER.

31:13.667 --> 31:16.041
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE DIED FROM. IT CHANGED HIM.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.792
FROM THE MOMENT
HE WAS DIAGNOSED,

31:17.834 --> 31:20.041
MY FATHER WAS
A DEAD MAN WALKING.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.250
AND HE MOURNED HIS DEATH
FOR YEARS.

31:22.291 --> 31:24.041
HE GAVE UP.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.166
IT WAS THE MOST DEPRESSING THING
I'D EVER SEEN, AND...

31:27.208 --> 31:28.375
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO ME.

31:28.417 --> 31:30.583
IT WON'T.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.250
I DO KNOW THAT.
NO, YOU DON'T.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.208
(Adam)
I GUESS I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.583
I MEAN, RICKY'S DOING GREAT.

31:38.625 --> 31:39.875
I'M DOING GREAT.

31:39.917 --> 31:42.083
I WENT TO COMPUTER SCHOOL,
CHANGED MY LIFE.

31:42.125 --> 31:46.041
IT'S DIFFERENT. I MEAN, I'M NOT
THE SAME GUY I WAS BEFORE.

31:46.083 --> 31:49.250
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL
CARRYING AROUND WHAT YOU DID.

31:49.291 --> 31:52.208
SURE, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M
STARTING TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.709
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE SOON
FOR THAT. DON'T YOU THINK?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.208
BUT YOU SAID THAT--

31:56.250 --> 31:57.291
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER REALLY

31:57.333 --> 31:59.291
THOUGHT ABOUT
THE MAN THAT YOU SHOT?

31:59.333 --> 32:01.333
WHAT IF HE HAD A FAMILY?

32:01.375 --> 32:03.041
WHAT IF HE HAD A SON?

32:03.083 --> 32:05.709
A SON WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HIS FATHER LEFT

32:05.750 --> 32:07.250
AND IS NEVER COMING HOME.

32:07.291 --> 32:10.917
YOU MAY HAVE RUINED A FAMILY,
ADAM.

32:10.959 --> 32:13.208
WHAT KIND OF PERSON CAN WALK
AROUND WITH THAT FOR TEN YEARS

32:13.250 --> 32:16.834
AND FEEL OKAY?

32:16.875 --> 32:19.291
(crying) OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.

32:21.333 --> 32:23.291
OH, GOD. I'M SO SORRY.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.834
I'M SO SORRY, ADAM.
I'M SO SORRY.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.625
THAT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL.
I APOLOGIZE.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.041
NO. NO.
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.917
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO, I WASN'T. I WASN'T.

32:38.959 --> 32:40.792
IF I'M A MURDERER,
I GOTTA KNOW.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.250
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

32:42.291 --> 32:45.125
THERE IS A REASON THAT
YOU NEVER TRIED TO FIND OUT.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.667
OKAY? THIS IS MY STUFF.
I'M GOING THROUGH SOMETHING,

32:47.709 --> 32:49.458
AND I--AND I LOST SIGHT OF...

32:49.500 --> 32:51.458
(clears throat) I LET MY NEEDS
BLEND WITH YOURS,

32:51.500 --> 32:53.166
AND--AND THAT WAS WRONG.

32:53.208 --> 32:55.166
I WAS WRONG.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.125
ADAM, I-I NEED YOU TO SEE
A NEW THERAPIST.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.917
WHAT?

32:58.959 --> 33:01.041
I-I-I WILL--I'LL GIVE YOU SOME
NAMES, PEOPLE I RECOMMEND,

33:01.083 --> 33:03.583
BUT I CANNOT SEE YOU ANYMORE.
I'M NOT HELPING YOU.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.041
NOBODY CAN HELP ME.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.917
IF I KILLED HIM,
I MEAN, WHAT DO I DO?

33:07.959 --> 33:09.291
WHAT CAN I DO?

33:09.333 --> 33:10.750
YOU ARE ALREADY DOING IT.

33:10.792 --> 33:14.166
YOU ARE LIVING YOUR LIFE
DIFFERENTLY, BETTER.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.041
YOU ARE LIVING YOUR AMENDS,

33:16.083 --> 33:18.208
BEING A BETTER PERSON,

33:18.250 --> 33:21.041
AND THAT WILL SET YOU FREE.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.083
LAST MONTH...

33:29.125 --> 33:31.041
ALICE PASSED.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.834
(sighs)

33:32.875 --> 33:34.625
SHE WAS MY WHOLE WORLD.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.750
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

33:36.792 --> 33:39.041
FOR 50 YEARS,
THIS WOMAN TOOK CARE OF ME,

33:39.083 --> 33:41.375
AND THEN SUDDENLY...
(makes whooshing sound)

33:43.125 --> 33:47.333
ANYWAY, I, UH...

33:47.375 --> 33:48.625
I CALLED JIMMY,

33:48.667 --> 33:53.125
AND THE FIRST THING
HE SAID TO ME WAS...

33:53.166 --> 33:55.041
"I REALLY LOVE YOU, DAD,

33:55.083 --> 33:57.959
AND I'LL BE THERE TONIGHT."

33:58.000 --> 34:01.333
HE HADN'T SAID HE LOVED ME
SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.667
AND OVER THE PAST MONTH,
WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSER.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.208
I MEAN, HE HAS BECOME

34:07.250 --> 34:10.750
A PHENOMENAL YOUNG MAN.

34:10.792 --> 34:14.792
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
GRIEVING, BUT, UH...

34:14.834 --> 34:16.542
I GOT MY SON BACK.

34:16.583 --> 34:19.000
AND MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY IT,
BUT...

34:20.959 --> 34:22.458
I'M HAPPY.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.041
I'M HAPPY.

34:32.834 --> 34:34.792
HEY.
(knock on door)

34:34.834 --> 34:36.041
I BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.625
YOU, UH, YOU DRINK TEA,
NOT COFFEE, RIGHT?

34:38.667 --> 34:40.000
YEAH. THANKS.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.959
HOW ARE YOU?
ARE YOU, UH, YOU OKAY?

34:44.291 --> 34:47.250
HEY.

34:47.291 --> 34:48.834
(lowered voice) WHAT ARE YOU,
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:48.875 --> 34:50.792
(lowered voice) WHAT AM I DOING
HERE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:50.834 --> 34:52.458
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED
TO CHANGE TIMES.
AND I TOLD YOU I COULDN'T.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.709
THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE MY TIME.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.041
HELLO? GUYS?

34:55.083 --> 34:56.959
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

35:02.792 --> 35:05.709
I BELIEVE I OWE YOU THIS

35:05.750 --> 35:09.041
FOR THE BABYSITTING CLUB
THAT YOU ORGANIZED.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.083
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:10.125 --> 35:11.959
SAM AND JAKE OUTED YOU.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.458
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE ODD

35:13.500 --> 35:14.750
THAT EVERYONE
KEPT BRINGING ME TEA.

35:14.792 --> 35:16.959
I SAID, "BRING HER TEA
OR SOMETHING."

35:17.000 --> 35:18.750
I DID NOT THINK
THEY WOULD BE SO LITERAL.

35:18.792 --> 35:20.625
SHELDON BROUGHT ME ICED TEA.

35:20.667 --> 35:23.041
UNFORTUNATELY, I HATE ICED TEA.
(chuckles)

35:23.083 --> 35:24.000
VIOLET.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.875
IN THE BEGINNING,
EVERYONE'S THERE.

35:29.917 --> 35:31.917
BUT PEOPLE FORGET.

35:31.959 --> 35:34.083
YOU KNOW, LIFE GOES ON,

35:34.125 --> 35:35.750
OR IT GOES ON
FOR EVERYONE ELSE

35:35.792 --> 35:37.917
EVEN IF IT'S NOT GOING ON
FOR YOU.

35:39.375 --> 35:40.709
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT--

35:40.750 --> 35:42.417
THANK YOU.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.667

I MISS PETE.

36:11.875 --> 36:15.750
I KNOW.

36:15.792 --> 36:19.583
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.000

A NEW E.R. DOC TODAY.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.041

36:31.083 --> 36:34.667

36:34.709 --> 36:35.875
DIFFICULT,
HERE'S THE DEAL--

36:35.917 --> 36:40.000
I WILL ALLOW YOU TO TALK
TO MY BELLY ONCE--

36:40.041 --> 36:42.959
ONCE A DAY.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
OKAY?

36:47.291 --> 36:49.375
DON'T BE WEIRD.
I WON'T.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.667
AND DON'T MASSAGE THE BELLY
OR RUB IT OR KISS IT

36:51.709 --> 36:53.458
LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF HOST
OR SOMETHING.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.792
OKAY.

36:54.834 --> 36:56.458
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU SING, I--
CHARLOTTE.

37:03.625 --> 37:06.000
HI.

37:06.041 --> 37:07.792
I CANNOT WAIT

I SAID NO KISSING.

37:20.291 --> 37:21.625
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.709
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAD

37:23.750 --> 37:25.083
YOU WANT A DRINK?
