"The Secret Circle"...

00:01.895 --> 00:04.731
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.732 --> 00:06.065
and for that I am so sorry.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.517
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.601 --> 00:09.853
but destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.937 --> 00:11.137
Hi. I'm Diana.

00:11.188 --> 00:12.655
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.324
- We're different.
- You're different.

00:14.408 --> 00:17.944
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.

00:17.995 --> 00:20.096
Here we have
real power now.

00:20.164 --> 00:21.831
A complete circle is 6.

00:21.916 --> 00:22.832
You complete
the circle.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.284
She's got the gift.

00:24.351 --> 00:26.669
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:26.737 --> 00:29.155
The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.

00:29.336 --> 00:32.343
Possession. Demons need human
form to be fully active.

00:33.286 --> 00:35.177
And now that the
demon has possessed Nick.

00:35.359 --> 00:37.193
I need a new body.
Yours'll do fine.

00:38.529 --> 00:40.613
You know what
we have to do.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.149
Drowning the demon is
the only way to save him.

Baking some things
for Nick's wake tomorrow.

02:01.947 --> 02:05.667
Grandma, there was a guy in
Nick's yard last night.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.585
It must have been
his older brother Jake.

02:07.636 --> 02:09.804
I didn't even know
Nick had a brother.

02:09.888 --> 02:11.839
Jake left town
a couple years ago.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.342
He was a troubled
young man back then.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.979
And now he's
lost his brother.

02:19.898 --> 02:22.984
We bound that circle with no
clue what we were doing,

02:23.068 --> 02:24.519
a-and look
what's happened.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.106
Maybe it's for the
best that it's broken now.

02:28.157 --> 02:29.357
It's not, Cassie.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.075
The circle is still bound.

02:31.143 --> 02:32.577
But Nick's gone.

02:32.644 --> 02:35.413
The ceremony you did doesn't
just bind you to each other.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.415
It binds you
to each other's bloodlines.

02:37.482 --> 02:38.950
Wait. Do you mean
Nick's brother?

02:39.001 --> 02:42.503
Yeah. Circles were
designed to last

02:42.588 --> 02:45.256
and to protect witches
and non-witches.

02:45.323 --> 02:48.159
Ok, I can't deal
with this right now.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.963
You have to know
to stay safe.

02:52.014 --> 02:53.514
How did this happen?

02:53.599 --> 02:54.549
I know it's a lot,

02:54.633 --> 02:56.434
but you're stronger
than you realize.

02:56.501 --> 02:59.637
Your lineage goes back to the very
beginning of witchcraft, Cassie.

02:59.688 --> 03:01.889
It's more powerful
than any of the others,

03:01.974 --> 03:04.842
and you were born
with the responsibility

03:04.893 --> 03:07.895
to lead and protect
your circle.

03:18.540 --> 03:20.041
Honey.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.309
Hey, daddy.

03:21.377 --> 03:24.412
I'm gonna go in to the office
for a few hours today.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.047
I won't be long.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.499
What's that?

03:28.550 --> 03:32.387
People are bringing
photos of Nick to the wake.

03:32.471 --> 03:34.389
I didn't think I had any.

03:34.473 --> 03:36.974
We weren't great friends.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.542
Then I remembered this.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.263
That's me and Nick,
isn't it?

03:44.566 --> 03:45.516
Yeah, when Nick
was little,

03:45.567 --> 03:47.551
he used to come
and look at the boats.

03:48.637 --> 03:51.973
Sometimes I'd take
you both out for a spin.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.557
I remember.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.661
He loved it,
but he was scared.

03:56.728 --> 03:58.830
He just clung
to your arm.

03:59.898 --> 04:01.916
I don't understand.

04:01.984 --> 04:04.235
That's his whole life?

04:04.286 --> 04:06.421
That's all he gets?

that awful?

04:59.975 --> 05:02.260
He used to work

05:02.311 --> 05:04.395
My dad gave him a job
when no one else would,

05:04.462 --> 05:06.347
and then he robs the place
one night after work.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.299

it's not up to us.

how hard this must be.

08:54.559 --> 08:55.993

know about us

08:56.044 --> 08:57.545

of the circle?

08:57.629 --> 08:58.546

08:58.630 --> 09:00.030
He left before
I found the book,

09:00.082 --> 09:01.749
before Nick knew.
If we let him leave,

09:01.833 --> 09:02.917
he takes
his power with him.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.835

trying to scare us.

09:59.830 --> 10:00.997
He doesn't
know about us.

10:01.048 --> 10:01.998
Someone obviously does.

10:02.049 --> 10:03.300
And they burnt
this symbol to prove it?

10:03.351 --> 10:06.502
That doesn't
make any sense.

10:15.813 --> 10:16.863

10:16.947 --> 10:19.399
There was a fire
at the abandoned house.

10:19.483 --> 10:20.567
Was anyone hurt?

10:20.651 --> 10:21.735
No. We put it out,

10:21.852 --> 10:23.036
but someone set it
intentionally,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.572
and there was a Crescent moon
burnt into the ground.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.956
Do you know
what it means?

10:29.493 --> 10:33.380
It's an ancient symbol
that means conquest.

10:33.464 --> 10:34.697
Conquest?

10:34.749 --> 10:37.584
It used to be burned onto
the ground of a witch's land

10:37.668 --> 10:38.918
to try and scare them,

10:39.003 --> 10:40.703
let them know
they'd been marked.

10:40.755 --> 10:42.705
You think someone
is threatening us?

10:42.757 --> 10:44.707
It certainly
looks like it.

10:45.643 --> 10:47.560
And when I saw Jake
last night,

10:47.645 --> 10:50.230
he was--he was setting
a fire behind his house.

10:50.314 --> 10:52.148
Have you talked to him
about the circle yet?

10:52.216 --> 10:54.550
- Not yet.
- Don't.

Sure, you did.

11:49.290 --> 11:52.459
You were always
so damn clingy, Faye.

11:53.610 --> 11:54.777
Screw you.

11:57.915 --> 12:00.049
Did you set
that fire today?

12:00.117 --> 12:01.167
What fire?

12:01.252 --> 12:04.053
You did, didn't you?

12:04.121 --> 12:07.457
Then tell me what the hell
you're talking about.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.512
Let's get
something clear.

12:12.596 --> 12:16.065
You don't get to tell me what
to do anymore.

12:22.406 --> 12:24.607
Jane could have
ruined everything,

12:24.658 --> 12:26.693
but I handled her.

12:26.777 --> 12:29.162
She thinks
we're allies.

12:32.616 --> 12:34.150
Charles,
am I boring you?

12:34.201 --> 12:35.919
No.

12:35.986 --> 12:37.620
Of course not.

12:37.671 --> 12:40.256
It's good.
Jane's handled.

12:43.294 --> 12:44.210
I'm sorry.

12:44.295 --> 12:46.212
I haven't been
sleeping very much.

12:46.297 --> 12:49.516
I know Nick's death
has been hard on you.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.519
Don't lose focus, Charles.

12:52.603 --> 12:56.539
This new bond with Jane might
be exactly the help we need.

12:56.607 --> 12:57.524
How?

12:57.608 --> 13:00.059
Every family had
a crystal at some point,

13:00.144 --> 13:02.979
and Jane's not just
any elder. She's a Blake.

13:03.030 --> 13:06.316
Now, there's a good chance
she might still have one,

13:06.367 --> 13:08.535
and if we can get
another crystal,

13:08.619 --> 13:11.037
then we can strengthen
the one we have.

13:11.121 --> 13:12.405
We can locate the others,

13:12.490 --> 13:14.707
and we can finally
get our powers back.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.378
Maybe,

13:18.462 --> 13:21.030
but it's hard to know
anything anymore.

13:24.051 --> 13:27.053
Are you sure you're
up to this, Charles?

13:29.206 --> 13:30.540
Because if you're not--

13:30.591 --> 13:32.225
I am.

13:44.939 --> 13:47.390
Hey, Diana, it's me.

13:47.441 --> 13:48.525
I talked
to my grandmother.

13:48.576 --> 13:49.742
Give me a call.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.900
Grandma?

14:09.296 --> 14:11.848
Who are you?

14:14.969 --> 14:16.102
What do you want?

14:16.186 --> 14:17.437
Your blood.

14:26.447 --> 14:27.814
Aah!

14:30.367 --> 14:32.652
Get off of her!

14:34.238 --> 14:36.939
Burning star,
blood-red eye.

14:38.576 --> 14:41.127
Burning star,
blood-red eye.

14:42.546 --> 14:45.781
Burning star.
Blood-red eye.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.501
Burning star,
blood-red eye.

14:48.586 --> 14:51.220
Burning star,
blood-red eye.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.130
Who the hell was that?

14:59.878 --> 15:00.962
I have no clue,

15:01.726 --> 15:04.039
but she seemed pretty intent
on killing you.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.540
W-why?

15:05.591 --> 15:07.175
Sorry. I was too busy

15:07.242 --> 15:09.711
trying to save your ass
to ask her.

15:09.762 --> 15:11.930
So I guess you know
you're a witch.

15:12.014 --> 15:14.182
Yeah.

15:15.551 --> 15:16.885
Here. Sit.

15:16.936 --> 15:19.604
Oh. But you left town before Diana
found her Book of Shadows.

15:19.689 --> 15:22.223
I found my own book
years ago.

15:22.275 --> 15:25.527
I read enough of it
to know a spell or two.

15:25.594 --> 15:27.896
We have a circle. Your brother
was a part of it.

15:27.947 --> 15:29.114
Lot of good it did him.

15:29.198 --> 15:30.598
You're a part
of it, too.

15:30.650 --> 15:33.251
I don't want anything
to do with your circle.

15:33.319 --> 15:35.603
You're just
a bunch of kids

15:35.655 --> 15:38.306
in way over your heads.

15:41.327 --> 15:44.646
What were you doing
in your yard last night?

15:44.714 --> 15:46.615
Putting out a fire.

15:46.682 --> 15:52.370
Someone, probably that crazy
bitch that was just in here,

15:52.438 --> 15:55.223
burned a Crescent
into the ground.

15:56.309 --> 15:58.393
Well, the way you were
looking at the fire,

15:58.460 --> 16:01.062
I thought
you had set it.

16:02.598 --> 16:05.650
What's going on?

16:05.735 --> 16:09.738
Oh. Um,
a woman broke in.

16:09.805 --> 16:11.740
She took
a swipe at me.

16:11.807 --> 16:13.058
Jake stopped her.

16:15.361 --> 16:17.862
Oh, thank God
you're all right.

16:18.948 --> 16:20.332
I owe you a thanks,

16:20.416 --> 16:22.500
but I can take it
from here.

16:22.585 --> 16:25.370
I believe it.

16:25.454 --> 16:26.654
Good night.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.490
Good night.

16:30.459 --> 16:33.578
You tell me
exactly what happened.

16:40.519 --> 16:43.021
So Cassie has no idea
who the woman was?

16:43.105 --> 16:45.673
No, and now she's just
out there somewhere.

16:47.009 --> 16:49.644
It's gonna be ok.

16:49.695 --> 16:51.279
Is it?

16:51.346 --> 16:54.366
I don't know.

16:57.036 --> 16:59.537
What the hell
is he doing here?

17:00.406 --> 17:02.356
Cassie.

17:04.242 --> 17:05.410
You ok?

17:05.493 --> 17:06.327
My God, Cassie.

17:06.378 --> 17:07.518
You didn't tell me
she hurt you.

17:07.519 --> 17:09.002
Jake heard me scream and
stopped her

17:09.053 --> 17:10.337
before she
could do much worse.

17:10.387 --> 17:12.271
We did a spell together
to send her away.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.294
So you know
you're a witch.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.244
Why didn't
you say anything?

17:17.297 --> 17:18.497
No reason to.

17:18.565 --> 17:22.084
I have no plans to stick around
Chance Harbor.

17:22.135 --> 17:23.919
Still should
have told us.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.420
Jeez, did I
hurt your feelings?

17:25.472 --> 17:27.056
Adam, Jake
saved my life.

17:27.107 --> 17:28.607
Yeah,
so you keep saying.

17:28.692 --> 17:30.559
It's pretty convenient
he happened to be there

17:30.610 --> 17:32.061
Adam.

17:32.112 --> 17:33.112
The knife
the woman used,

17:33.196 --> 17:34.613
it had a Crescent moon
on it.

17:34.698 --> 17:37.116
So she must be the one who burned
the symbol in front of the house.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.734
My grandmother
said it's a way

17:38.785 --> 17:40.452
to mark a witch
before an attack.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.488
She marked
his house, too.

17:42.572 --> 17:44.440
She could be a witch
from another circle.

17:44.507 --> 17:46.325
Maybe she followed you into town
from wherever you came from.

17:46.409 --> 17:50.296
I guess it's possible, but I've
never seen her before.

17:52.674 --> 17:56.393
Well, I'm just
glad you're ok.

17:56.722 --> 17:58.756
I'm glad you're ok, too.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.676
I'll talk to Adam.

18:03.845 --> 18:05.370
Eh, sorry about that.

18:05.371 --> 18:08.256
I need to take care of things
for the funeral.

18:08.324 --> 18:09.758
I'll see you later.

18:13.463 --> 18:14.880
What's your problem?

18:14.964 --> 18:16.682
You know how much
I hate that guy.

18:16.766 --> 18:17.632
I have for years.

18:17.684 --> 18:19.000
It's different.

18:19.052 --> 18:22.437

boyfriend, and not mine.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.361
Ok, we need Jake to stay
in town,

20:05.386 --> 20:06.671
and I don't know
how to convince him.

20:06.793 --> 20:08.460
He has a life somewhere else.
Just let him leave.

20:08.544 --> 20:10.295
Cassie might be dead
if it wasn't for Jake.

20:10.379 --> 20:12.747
You have to get over
this thing you have about him.

20:12.799 --> 20:13.799
It's not a thing.

20:13.883 --> 20:15.917
Jake took advantage
of my father.

20:15.968 --> 20:17.335
He made a fool
out of him.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.587
That's
his specialty,

20:18.638 --> 20:19.588
making fools
out of people.

20:19.639 --> 20:21.256
So now you're
against this?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.625
So I'm not allowed to change
my mind, but you are?

20:23.676 --> 20:25.177
Ok, we need to put aside
all our issues.

20:25.261 --> 20:28.480
We've been marked, and there's
a psycho coming after all of us.

20:28.564 --> 20:29.731
We need all our power.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.183
If we can't
trust Jake,

20:31.267 --> 20:32.734
then I think we're
stronger without him.

20:32.801 --> 20:35.353
You know,
Nick wasn't perfect,

20:35.438 --> 20:37.606
but we knew
he had our backs,

20:37.657 --> 20:39.741
and it still
wasn't enough.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.946
When you and Jake
were together,

20:45.014 --> 20:46.615
it seemed like you
had a connection.

20:46.682 --> 20:48.416
You think we can
really trust him?

20:48.484 --> 20:50.752
If we let him leave,
we'll never know.

20:57.543 --> 20:59.160
You and Jake
were together?

20:59.212 --> 21:00.161
No.

21:00.213 --> 21:01.162
Just to warn you,

21:01.214 --> 21:03.431
he'll sleep with you,
then dump you

21:03.433 --> 21:07.335
and leave you in a million
twisted little pieces.

21:07.386 --> 21:09.855
But maybe
that's what you're into.

21:18.848 --> 21:20.815
she moved so fast.

21:20.883 --> 21:23.101
We have to assume
she'll be back.

21:53.099 --> 21:55.267
My mom gave this to me,

21:55.351 --> 21:57.269
and if Amelia were here,

21:57.353 --> 21:59.604
she'd pass it on to you.

22:07.697 --> 22:09.948
This is what you used
on Melissa.

22:10.032 --> 22:11.366
Mm-hmm.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.368
Think of it
as a lens

22:13.419 --> 22:14.703
that magnifies
your power.

22:14.754 --> 22:16.738
Circle magic
is complicated.

22:16.789 --> 22:21.075
It involves other personalities,
other attitudes.

22:21.127 --> 22:22.910
The crystal
is simpler.

22:22.962 --> 22:25.714
It's a reflection
of you.

22:26.915 --> 22:30.018
I don't think I'm the person
that you think I am.

22:30.085 --> 22:34.105
I can't even keep
the circle together.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.479
I know exactly
who you are.

22:49.322 --> 22:51.823
No one can know you
have the crystal,

22:51.907 --> 22:54.275
not even the rest
of your circle.

22:54.327 --> 22:56.628
It's the most coveted magic
there is,

22:56.712 --> 23:00.131
but it can bring out
the very worst in people.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.584
Ok?

23:22.355 --> 23:24.155
Simone.

23:30.096 --> 23:32.998
Hey, Jake.

23:39.538 --> 23:41.155
Figured you'd find me.

23:54.387 --> 23:56.337
Why did you follow
me to Chance Harbor,

23:56.389 --> 23:58.390
and what the hell were you doing
marking my house?

23:58.474 --> 24:00.675
There's one answer
to both your questions--

24:00.726 --> 24:04.696
because you're a witch,
and I don't trust witches.

24:06.282 --> 24:07.649
You hate my kind,
I know.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.184
Well, I hate yours,
the true believer,

24:10.236 --> 24:12.370
so blinded with hate and sure of
their righteousness

24:12.455 --> 24:14.689
that they're frothing
at the mouth to kill.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.466
Give me the blood you took
from Cassie Blake.

24:29.638 --> 24:30.638
Get away from there.

24:30.706 --> 24:32.924
You don't want
to test me, Simone.

24:45.187 --> 24:47.772
It's too soon
for bloodletting.

24:54.914 --> 24:57.198
You just made
a big mistake.

24:57.249 --> 24:59.751
Stay the hell
out of my way.

Do you want a drop?

25:36.865 --> 25:38.532
It's Nick's special
witches' brew.

25:38.584 --> 25:41.535
Uh, this is a wake
to remember Nick.

25:41.587 --> 25:43.554
You didn't even
know him.

25:43.639 --> 25:47.058
This is the absolute best way to
remember Nick, trust me.

25:47.142 --> 25:51.179
But then I guess you're more
his brother's type, anyway.

25:51.230 --> 25:53.848
Melissa. We're
just toasting Nick.

hurt this much?

26:33.922 --> 26:35.756
It was so long ago.

26:37.626 --> 26:40.862
That wake was
at the school gym.

26:40.929 --> 26:42.280
Amelia
wasn't there.

26:42.347 --> 26:44.899
I tried to look
for her,

26:44.950 --> 26:48.202
but she never
showed up.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.537
After everything
that happened,

26:49.604 --> 26:51.155
she was still
too distraught

26:51.240 --> 26:53.441
over Blackwell to go
to the funeral.

26:53.509 --> 26:55.442
Who's Blackwell?

26:57.045 --> 26:58.379
Don't listen to me.

26:58.446 --> 27:00.414
But you need
to slow down, ok?

27:00.465 --> 27:02.283
We are kind of
the hosts here.

27:02.334 --> 27:04.285
Yeah. You got it.

27:11.593 --> 27:15.396
Jake, what are
you up to?

27:15.463 --> 27:16.514
I know
it's something.

27:16.598 --> 27:18.599
No one changes that much
in 2 years.

27:18.650 --> 27:19.901
Adam, stop it.

27:19.968 --> 27:21.936
Forget it, Cassie.
He's probably loaded.

27:21.987 --> 27:24.405
Runs in the family.

27:30.495 --> 27:32.864
Stop this!

27:33.749 --> 27:34.782
Stop.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.317
What the hell
is wrong with you?

27:36.368 --> 27:38.252
Did you hear what he said
about my dad? Huh?

27:38.320 --> 27:40.338
That's not
what started this.

27:40.422 --> 27:41.488
Diana, wait.

27:41.540 --> 27:42.823
Just leave me alone.

27:43.709 --> 27:47.261
Ok, that was bad.
I'm sorry.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.432
I'm so sorry
about your brother.

27:51.499 --> 27:53.467
He didn't deserve
what happened.

27:53.518 --> 27:55.219
Thanks.

27:55.304 --> 27:56.220
You need anything,

27:56.305 --> 27:57.688
you come to me,
ok, Nick?

27:58.857 --> 28:00.224
It's Jake.

28:03.011 --> 28:04.729
I'm sorry.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.711
You ever think
that no matter what we do

28:20.796 --> 28:23.164
or how we try
to control our lives,

28:23.231 --> 28:25.866
that it's just
out of our hands?

28:25.918 --> 28:28.369
History just
keeps repeating.

28:28.437 --> 28:30.137
Come on, Charles.

28:30.205 --> 28:32.807
I saved you a place
at our table.

28:37.813 --> 28:40.431
People really
hate you, huh?

28:40.515 --> 28:42.600
Doesn't bother me.

28:42.668 --> 28:43.901
Maybe not,

28:43.986 --> 28:46.821
but you did run away.

28:47.823 --> 28:50.274
That was
a long time ago.

28:53.061 --> 28:55.279
My mom ran away, too,

28:55.347 --> 28:58.282
left here
and never came back.

28:58.367 --> 29:01.202
We moved all the time
from town to town, and--

29:02.704 --> 29:06.457
It was like she was hiding from
here, no matter where we were.

29:07.759 --> 29:11.345
I don't know if leaving
actually gave her any peace.

29:12.965 --> 29:15.166
Did it work for you?

29:16.251 --> 29:19.770
Peace isn't what
I was looking for.

29:21.773 --> 29:24.141
I didn't know you
back then,

29:24.226 --> 29:27.628
but you must have
found something,

29:27.696 --> 29:29.447
because underneath
all that attitude,

29:29.531 --> 29:34.101
you don't really seem like the guy
everyone should hate.

29:42.027 --> 29:43.277
All right, well,

29:43.328 --> 29:46.497
it should be safe
to go back inside now.

29:47.632 --> 29:50.151
I'm gonna hang here
a while.

30:14.084 --> 30:15.617
Yeah.

30:17.087 --> 30:18.370
Mr. Conant.

30:19.956 --> 30:23.092
Oh. Come on in.

30:23.176 --> 30:24.093
You disappeared.

30:24.177 --> 30:26.428
Saw the light on,
so I just thought...

30:26.513 --> 30:28.964
An old drunk like me could use
some coffee.

30:29.933 --> 30:31.884
I put milk in it
the way you like.

30:31.935 --> 30:32.885
Thanks.

30:32.936 --> 30:34.937
Poor Nick.

30:35.021 --> 30:38.724
You know, maybe if he had
someone like you

30:38.792 --> 30:41.577
to pick him up
when he was down...

30:41.644 --> 30:43.061
He did, actually,

30:43.113 --> 30:44.263
Melissa.

30:44.330 --> 30:46.064
Hmm.

30:46.132 --> 30:49.401
You love Adam,
don't you?

30:50.670 --> 30:51.987
Yes.

30:52.071 --> 30:54.272
He is so damn lucky
to have you.

30:54.324 --> 30:57.275
We're lucky to have
each other.

30:57.327 --> 30:59.611
I wish you were
the one, Diana.

30:59.662 --> 31:01.763
You deserve
to be happy.

31:01.831 --> 31:03.916
What?

31:03.983 --> 31:07.035
It's Adam's destiny to be with
Cassie Blake.

31:08.154 --> 31:11.757
Our families are written
in the stars--

31:11.808 --> 31:14.259
Adam and Cassie,

31:14.310 --> 31:15.794
me and Amelia.

31:19.182 --> 31:20.131
I should go.

31:20.183 --> 31:23.152
The sooner
you let him go,

31:23.236 --> 31:25.971
the sooner
you can be free.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.575
Trust me.

31:30.743 --> 31:33.495
Bad things happen
when you mess with fate.

31:46.509 --> 31:48.460
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

31:48.511 --> 31:51.213
You think you and me have
enough magic to fly?

31:51.297 --> 31:52.998
Stop it, Faye.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.667
Is Jake in there?

31:55.718 --> 31:58.053
'Cause I am
so over him.

31:58.137 --> 32:01.223
Is that what this
is about, Jake?

32:01.291 --> 32:03.192
I have been through this
with you before,

32:03.276 --> 32:06.178
and he almost put you
in a psych ward last time, ok?

32:06.246 --> 32:08.513
You need to stay
away from him.

32:08.565 --> 32:11.650
I was a kid then.
Now I'm a wicked witch.

32:13.036 --> 32:14.403
Where are you going?

32:14.487 --> 32:16.955
You just don't get it.

32:17.023 --> 32:19.357
Tonight isn't about you

32:19.409 --> 32:21.493
for once or Jake.

32:21.544 --> 32:23.829
Do you understand?

32:23.880 --> 32:27.416
It's a wake for Nick,
and I loved him.

32:28.718 --> 32:30.252
I know.

32:31.838 --> 32:33.555
He loved you, too.

32:38.578 --> 32:40.762
You know, I can tell you're
actually thinking about yourself

32:40.847 --> 32:43.599
and what you wish you had
with Jake when you say that.

32:48.421 --> 32:52.223
But still,
it means a lot.

32:52.275 --> 32:53.859
Thank you.

32:55.495 --> 32:58.063
You know me
pretty well.

32:59.032 --> 33:00.398
Yeah.

33:08.675 --> 33:11.593
♪ You are afraid... ♪

33:11.678 --> 33:13.295
You deserve that.

33:16.299 --> 33:17.516
Probably.

33:17.583 --> 33:20.752
What you're doing to Diana,
it's not right.

33:20.803 --> 33:21.803
She loves you.

33:21.888 --> 33:22.971
I love her, too.

33:23.056 --> 33:25.774
I just
don't trust Jake,

33:25.842 --> 33:28.427
and I certainly don't trust him
with you.

33:28.494 --> 33:29.394
Adam.

33:29.462 --> 33:31.563
I can't help
how I feel.

33:36.202 --> 33:38.453
Everything's just so screwed up
right now.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.323
We're all hurting, Adam.

33:42.942 --> 33:44.493
Maybe it's
easier for you

33:44.577 --> 33:46.828
because you don't know anybody,
not really.

33:46.913 --> 33:47.963
That is not fair.

33:48.047 --> 33:50.782
I may not have
been here my whole life,

33:50.833 --> 33:55.170
but you guys are the closest
thing I've ever had to real friends,

33:55.254 --> 33:56.555
especially Diana.

33:59.592 --> 34:02.244
None of this is easy.

34:02.312 --> 34:04.096
I'm sorry.

34:05.765 --> 34:06.732
You're right.

34:06.799 --> 34:08.650
We're in this
together.

34:08.735 --> 34:11.320
♪ You are free... ♪

34:11.404 --> 34:15.357
You know, I hope I'm wrong
about Jake. I really do.

34:16.442 --> 34:18.025
I don't think I am.

34:25.818 --> 34:27.536
I'll be right back.

34:30.672 --> 34:32.341
I saw you
with the Blake girl.

34:32.425 --> 34:34.492
You were closer to kissing her
than killing her.

34:34.543 --> 34:36.844
You're never gonna be able
to complete the mission.

34:36.929 --> 34:39.464
I told you to stay
out of my way.

34:39.514 --> 34:41.099
I'm not done here.

34:43.186 --> 34:44.668
I am.

35:18.537 --> 35:20.205
Oh, my God.

35:43.790 --> 35:46.124
So she was a witch?

35:46.192 --> 35:48.143
Pretty nasty one.

35:48.211 --> 35:51.563
Seemed like you two
were talking.

35:51.614 --> 35:54.199
She said she was here
to scavenge power.

35:54.267 --> 35:56.118
She knew
a witch had died.

35:56.202 --> 35:58.103
That's what
scavengers come for.

35:58.171 --> 36:00.122
It's scary how much
stuff is out there,

36:00.206 --> 36:02.708
how much I don't know.

36:06.429 --> 36:10.165
Cassie, the way her knife flew
out of her hand,

36:10.250 --> 36:11.500
did you do that?

36:11.568 --> 36:13.618
Because I thought
once a circle was bound,

36:13.670 --> 36:15.287
you can't do magic
on your own.

36:15.338 --> 36:17.089
No. I--I saw that.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.974
I thought it was you.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.895
Maybe it was
the both of us

36:22.962 --> 36:24.146
somehow.

36:26.766 --> 36:30.652
Jake, you can't leave
Chance Harbor.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.603
I have to.

36:31.654 --> 36:32.771
No, you don't.

36:32.822 --> 36:34.740
We are all
bound together,

36:34.807 --> 36:36.641
and I know that's not something
that you ever wanted,

36:36.693 --> 36:38.193
and, trust me,
neither did I.

36:38.278 --> 36:40.963
But it's not something
that you can run from.

36:42.332 --> 36:44.867
If you really knew me, you
wouldn't want me to stay.

36:44.951 --> 36:46.985
I don't think
that we have a choice.

36:47.036 --> 36:47.953
The bad is coming.

36:48.004 --> 36:49.087
They're here.

36:49.155 --> 36:52.457
It's what killed
your brother and our parents

36:52.508 --> 36:55.493
and almost you tonight.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.631
We can't do this
without you.

36:59.682 --> 37:01.400
We are not strong enough.

37:01.467 --> 37:03.501
And if we don't try,
then Nick's death

37:03.553 --> 37:06.388
is gonna seem a lot more senseless
than it already does.

37:07.724 --> 37:10.225
You've got all
the answers, huh?

37:10.293 --> 37:13.295
No, not usually.

37:13.363 --> 37:14.563
Heh.

37:17.350 --> 37:19.751
Maybe I'll stick around
a little while.

37:19.819 --> 37:21.737
There are still
a few people around town

37:21.821 --> 37:23.906
that haven't tried
to kick my ass.

37:43.643 --> 37:45.661
Hey.

37:46.829 --> 37:49.348
What happened?
You disappeared.

37:49.399 --> 37:52.651
I went for a walk.

37:54.170 --> 37:57.522
I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

37:57.573 --> 37:59.825
Your dad told me
about you and Cassie

37:59.892 --> 38:01.159
being destined
to be together.

38:01.227 --> 38:04.079
It's just an old story
to make him feel better

38:04.163 --> 38:06.114
about being in love
with Cassie's mom.

38:06.199 --> 38:07.749
That's what I want...

38:09.202 --> 38:12.037
The kind of love that makes
you want to believe in destiny.

38:12.088 --> 38:13.455
That's what we have.

38:13.539 --> 38:14.790
No,

38:14.874 --> 38:17.793
because if we did, I wouldn't
feel like I do right now.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.895
Diana...

38:21.347 --> 38:23.348
I love you.
You know that.

38:25.251 --> 38:27.269
There's a way
you look at Cassie

38:27.353 --> 38:30.138
that I could
never understand,

38:30.206 --> 38:32.808
and I think
I get it now.

38:32.892 --> 38:35.394
It's wonder,

38:35.445 --> 38:39.481
wondering if every time you find
yourselves together,

38:39.565 --> 38:42.317
it's choice
or destiny.

38:42.402 --> 38:44.269
You need
to figure out which.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.038
Diana, please.
You're wrong.

38:46.105 --> 38:48.407
No. I've been standing
on the sidelines,

38:48.458 --> 38:50.608
watching it
since she got here.

38:52.628 --> 38:54.779
I can't do that
anymore.

39:09.479 --> 39:10.429
Hey.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.480
What's wrong?

39:11.564 --> 39:13.148
I broke up with Adam.

39:13.232 --> 39:15.650
What happened?

39:19.405 --> 39:20.572
You.

39:23.743 --> 39:24.976
Uh, Diana--

39:25.028 --> 39:27.496
well, just tell me
what to do.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.181
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

39:29.248 --> 39:31.033
I honestly don't know.

39:33.202 --> 39:35.837
I don't even know
why I'm here.

39:40.159 --> 39:43.045
I guess because
he was my best friend,

39:43.112 --> 39:45.047
and I have
nowhere else to go,

39:45.114 --> 39:47.632
no one else
who really knows me.

40:21.968 --> 40:23.585
You killed Simone.

40:23.669 --> 40:24.970
Why?

40:25.838 --> 40:26.888
You mean aside
from the fact

40:26.973 --> 40:28.540
that she tried
to gut me with a blade?

40:28.591 --> 40:31.042
Don't get smart
with me, Jake.

40:31.094 --> 40:34.229
I will
gut you myself.

40:36.432 --> 40:38.383
You killed a fellow
witch hunter.

40:38.434 --> 40:39.384
Why?

40:39.435 --> 40:41.186
Cassie saw her
talking to me.

40:41.237 --> 40:43.572
I lied and said
she was a witch,

40:43.656 --> 40:46.491
but it could have
been a disaster.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.411
You always taught me
to follow protocol,

40:49.495 --> 40:51.613
and that's
what I was doing.

40:53.666 --> 40:55.417
Maybe she was right.

40:55.501 --> 40:57.702
Maybe we made
a mistake

40:57.753 --> 40:59.404
using a witch
to kill witches,

40:59.455 --> 41:00.738
especially when
his own bloodline

41:00.790 --> 41:02.007
is connected
to the prey.

41:02.074 --> 41:04.009
I-I've never
let you down before,

41:04.076 --> 41:06.077
and I won't start now.

41:10.383 --> 41:12.217
Are you sure
of that?

41:13.752 --> 41:17.305
'Cause I hear Cassie Blake is
a compelling girl.

41:17.390 --> 41:23.361
I've come here to avenge
the death of my family,

41:23.429 --> 41:25.647
to rid Chance Harbor
of witches,

41:25.731 --> 41:28.650
and I will not fail.
