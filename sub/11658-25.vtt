00:54.767 --> 00:56.367
I picked up the extra ice

00:56.433 --> 00:58.033
aren't you finished with
the hors d'oeuvres yet?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.800
I'm still working
on the celery sticks.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.834
Did you finish the decorations,
Rose?

01:02.900 --> 01:05.500
No, not yet.
I kind of got sidetracked.

01:05.567 --> 01:06.900
Look!

01:08.800 --> 01:11.800
You've been doing this
the past 45 minutes?

01:11.867 --> 01:13.467
Uh-huh. Isn't he cute?

01:13.533 --> 01:14.800
I call him Scotty.

01:20.734 --> 01:22.800
Now you can
call him garbage.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.633
Help Blanche
with the hors d'oeuvres.

01:27.133 --> 01:29.233
What time's
the birthday girl arriving?

01:29.300 --> 01:31.400
I told Roberta 2 o'clock.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.033
You think she suspects anything?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.934
Please. The woman is 88.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.734
She still tries to find
<i>Gunsmoke</i> on Sunday nights.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.600
Dorothy, get the cake.

01:40.667 --> 01:44.500
We'll take these things
into the living room.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.533
Where is the cake?
Rose, did you take the cake out?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.166
-I haven't even seen it yet.
-Ma, what did you do with the cake?

01:49.233 --> 01:51.066
I haven't seen it either.

01:51.133 --> 01:53.834
What do you mean?
You were supposed to bake it.

01:56.333 --> 02:00.333
-I was? Oh, Ma! You forgot!
-I didn't forget.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.166
I wanted it fresh.

02:02.233 --> 02:03.000
I'll bake it now.

02:03.066 --> 02:05.767
Roberta's coming in 45 minutes.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.533
I don't think you have time.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.633
In 45 minutes, I can bake two cakes
and knit a sweater.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.834
Move.
The maestro approaches the podium.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.834
I hope Sophia finishes in time.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.100
You can't give a good birthday party
without a cake.

02:21.166 --> 02:25.333
I recall a party with three cakes
that wasn't terrific.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.567
-Three cakes?
-Yeah.

02:26.633 --> 02:30.367
Rose had planned
a surprise party for me.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.467
You were still living
at shady pines.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.000
You mean the home.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.667
Say it, Dorothy, "the home."

02:37.834 --> 02:41.300
Anyway, Rose had planned
this surprise birthday party for me.

02:41.367 --> 02:45.700
I'll never forget it. I've never had
such a surprise in my life.

02:58.934 --> 03:02.333
Woo!

03:02.400 --> 03:05.233
I have lots of fun planned for you
this afternoon,

03:05.300 --> 03:08.967
but finish your
Mr. Ha Ha dog first, because...

03:24.033 --> 03:25.900
Oh, isn't this fun?

03:27.500 --> 03:30.533
Dorothy, you haven't even
touched your Mr. Ha Ha dog.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.934
You're right.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.367
There, I touched it.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.934
You're not having any fun,
are you, Dorothy?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.600
Am I that transparent?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.600
You're the one who always complains

03:48.667 --> 03:51.300
that her birthday parties
are dull and boring.

03:51.367 --> 03:54.767
When I saw Mr. Ha Ha's advertised
on television, it looked like fun.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.033
For a 5-year-old, Rose.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.333
Or someone who thinks like one.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.367
-I ruined your birthday.
-Oh, no, you haven't.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.500
-You haven't ruined it.
-Yes, I have.

04:06.567 --> 04:09.100
I'm a big dope.
You must hate me.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.567
Oh, honey, come on.
Now, don't cry.

04:12.633 --> 04:15.166
Rose, I don't hate you.

04:15.233 --> 04:18.367
No, I'm really having fun.
It's just that you know,

04:18.433 --> 04:22.700
it took me a little while to get
into the spirit of things.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.700
-Seriously?
-Oh, yes.

04:24.767 --> 04:28.300
Both Blanche and I are having a lot
of fun. Aren't we, Blanche?

04:28.367 --> 04:32.734
Well, who wouldn't have fun eating
a foot-long Mr. Ha Ha dog?

04:34.233 --> 04:37.600
-Drinking a 32-ounce...
-Cherry burpee.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.834
If you drink three of them,
you get to keep Mr. Ha Ha's hat.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.166
If you drink three of them,

04:44.233 --> 04:46.500
you should get to keep
Mr. Ha Ha's kidney.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.867
Guess who's back!

04:54.934 --> 04:57.200
Mr. Ha Ha!

04:57.266 --> 04:58.967
That's right.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.967
Now it's time for the
Mr. Ha Ha birthday roundup!

05:03.033 --> 05:06.400
When I call your name,
please come up on stage!

05:09.934 --> 05:12.000
Bobby Spina!

05:12.967 --> 05:15.900
Please say you didn't do this, Rose.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.500
Jeannie Taylor!

05:17.567 --> 05:20.133
Tell me you didn't do this.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.967
Dorothy Zbornak!

05:22.033 --> 05:24.033
Oh, no, Dorothy.
Please, don't.

05:24.100 --> 05:27.133
-Dorothy Zbornak!
-You're making a fool of yourself.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.934
Mr. Ha Ha's looking at you.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.467
-Are you Dorothy Zbornak?
-That's right.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.033
-Get up on stage, Dorothy!
-Get bent, Ha Ha!

05:36.533 --> 05:38.266
Come on, kids!

05:38.333 --> 05:41.734
Let's give Dorothy
a great big Ha Ha cheer!

05:41.800 --> 05:44.233
Ha Ha!

05:44.300 --> 05:49.700
Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy!
Dorothy! Dorothy!

05:49.767 --> 05:53.467
Dorothy! Dorothy!

05:53.533 --> 05:56.066
Dorothy! Woo!

06:04.500 --> 06:11.233
Well, it says here on my Ha Ha
birthday list that Bobby is 7...

06:12.333 --> 06:16.033
Jeannie is 9, and Dorothy is--

06:16.100 --> 06:18.333
I'll punch your heart out, Ha Ha.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.700
Dorothy is the oldest,
and as the oldest,

06:22.767 --> 06:26.233
you get to lead
the birthday parade!

06:27.200 --> 06:29.200
Here is your
parade leader's hat.

06:30.767 --> 06:33.266
Mr. Music, if you please.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.200
(parade music playing)

06:48.667 --> 06:52.033
Don't prolong this. I know what car
you drive, Ha Ha.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.734
The parade's over!

06:54.800 --> 06:57.700
Let's hear it for all
the birthday boys and girls!

07:00.567 --> 07:03.266
But the fun's
just about to begin

07:03.333 --> 07:06.900
because it's time for
your Ha Ha hot fudge cake,

07:06.967 --> 07:11.467
free to birthday boys and girls,
only $1.98 to my other friends.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.567
No, thank you. I've had enough.

07:13.633 --> 07:17.500
Oh! I think we have
a cranky birthday girl!

07:18.767 --> 07:21.700
You see, kids,
when you get a little older,

07:21.767 --> 07:23.767
you can get a little cranky.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.333
And when you get
as old as Dorothy,

07:26.400 --> 07:28.433
you can be a pain in the Ha Ha!

07:29.233 --> 07:34.100
So why don't you lighten up
and make a wish?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.500
Come on, kids.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.900
Make a wish,
and blow out the candles.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.300
I hope everybody gets
what they wished for.

07:43.367 --> 07:46.166
Do you really, Mr. Ha Ha?

07:46.867 --> 07:49.500
If I were you,
I'd put the cake down.

07:49.567 --> 07:52.867
You see, Mr. Music's
brother is Mr. Lawyer.

07:52.934 --> 07:56.500
Besides, that's not
a very adult thing to do.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.934
You're right.
I can't do it.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.700
-Mr. Ha Ha.
-Yes, bobby?

08:07.100 --> 08:09.300
Happy birthday, Dorothy.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.834
I would love to
have been there, but I was...

08:17.900 --> 08:20.100
At the home.
We know, Ma.

08:21.767 --> 08:25.100
-How's the cake coming?
-Beautiful. I got everything I need,

08:25.166 --> 08:27.734
coconut, eggs,
unbleached flour, rum.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.900
-You're making a rum cake?
-No.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.133
I love to bake.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.767
In St. Olaf,
I always baked our birthday cakes.

08:36.834 --> 08:37.967
Charlie loved them.

08:39.367 --> 08:42.667
I remember the last cake
I baked in St. Olaf.

08:42.734 --> 08:44.166
It was kind of different.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.900
Oh, my birthday!

09:18.967 --> 09:22.300
I completely forgot!

09:22.367 --> 09:25.934
Well, I'd better make a wish
and blow out those candles

09:26.000 --> 09:29.967
before Mr. Hickenlooper
has the volunteer fire brigade here

09:30.033 --> 09:32.500
pumping water
on my clean kitchen floor.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.467
I swear, that man
will look for any excuse

09:36.533 --> 09:39.967
to make that siren sound
through his nose.

09:40.033 --> 09:42.500
Inga Lundquist told me
just this last week...

09:42.567 --> 09:45.166
I know. Shut up, Rose,
and blow out your candles.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.233
Ok. A wish.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.633
I guess that was
kind of a silly wish.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.300
I know you can't really
be here with me, Charlie.

10:04.166 --> 10:08.233
It's taken me eight months
to accept that, but I finally have.

10:09.934 --> 10:13.834
Then why our usual little,
private birthday celebration?

10:13.900 --> 10:16.333
Somehow it feels
less lonely, Charlie.

10:16.834 --> 10:21.000
This is the first special day
I've had to spend without you.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.967
If it was Christmas,
I'd have hung your stocking.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.767
Or if it was your birthday,

10:26.834 --> 10:30.233
I would have asked
the clerk at Tuttle's

10:30.300 --> 10:32.767
to help me pick out a tie for you.

10:32.834 --> 10:37.633
That would've gotten some
strange looks from the sales staff.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.867
Although they already
look at me strangely

10:40.934 --> 10:44.600
because of the time I ordered
a double-breasted navy suit

10:44.667 --> 10:47.066
with a drop seat
for cousin Wendell.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.433
Anyway,
that was part of the reason.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.633
The other part was
I wanted to talk to you.

10:55.700 --> 11:00.166
I know. I didn't need
a special occasion for that.

11:00.233 --> 11:03.367
It would be an occasion
if I stopped talking,

11:03.433 --> 11:07.533
but I figured
since it was my birthday,

11:07.600 --> 11:10.333
you wouldn't be upset when you hear
what I've got to tell you.

11:16.433 --> 11:19.800
I've decided to sell the house
and leave St. Olaf, Charlie.

11:20.934 --> 11:23.934
The winters are rough
here in Minnesota,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
and this place is
too filled with memories

11:27.066 --> 11:28.700
to let me get on with my life.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.734
I need to start over
without you, Charlie,

11:32.800 --> 11:34.600
and I think this is the best way.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.667
I know it'll be tough in a
strange town all alone,

11:40.734 --> 11:44.934
but I've read some wonderful things
about Miami.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.633
It won't be long
before I meet nice people

11:47.700 --> 11:49.533
and make some new friends.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.300
I have a real good feeling
about that.

11:53.867 --> 11:57.500
So, I just wanted you
to know what I decided.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.400
I hope to be in Florida
before the next winter comes.

12:04.500 --> 12:08.166
But I know that wherever I am,
you'll be right there with me.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.700
I love you, Charlie.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.333
I miss you.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.033
It's my birthday.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.600
You know the rules.

12:20.667 --> 12:21.967
I get the Rose.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.700
And a pinch of baking soda.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.100
Ma, that looked like
an awfully big pinch.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.667
Who cares?

12:44.100 --> 12:46.500
Sophia, maybe you
should sit down.

12:46.567 --> 12:47.667
I am sitting.

12:48.834 --> 12:52.200
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee.

12:52.266 --> 12:53.700
Don't panic. I'm fine.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.200
I haven't had that much.

12:55.266 --> 12:58.967
Besides, you think I'd ruin
Roberta's milestone birthday?

12:59.033 --> 13:00.934
Milestone? She's 88.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.433
Right. After 80, every year without
a headstone is a milestone.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.133
I think my milestone birthday
was when I turned 50.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.734
Ma, I remember your 50th.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.767
We were going to a party at Guido's,
but you were fighting with pop.

13:16.834 --> 13:18.967
-Oh, yeah.
-I'll never forget it.

13:19.033 --> 13:21.934
It was Brooklyn, April, 1956.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.200
-Dorothy?
-Yes, Ma.

13:23.266 --> 13:24.900
I tell the stories around here.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.200
Picture it.

13:26.266 --> 13:29.834
Brooklyn, April, 1956.

13:32.667 --> 13:36.333
Fine, if that's the way you feel,
I'm staying right here.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.333
Fine, stay there forever,
you big bajagaloop.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.066
I curse the day I ever met you.

13:42.133 --> 13:44.400
Ma, it's me, Dorothy.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.300
-Happy birthday, Ma.
-Ah, shut up.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.567
You're welcome.

13:57.633 --> 14:01.467
You'll be late for your party.
Stan's in the car.

14:01.533 --> 14:02.600
I'm not going.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.567
What do you mean?

14:04.633 --> 14:08.400
What's there to celebrate,
that I'm leaving my husband?

14:08.467 --> 14:10.100
You and pop were fighting.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.633
You love showing off that
college education, don't you?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.200
Ok. Why are you mad at pop?

14:17.266 --> 14:22.200
Because your father is a miserable,
no-good, insensitive bum!

14:22.266 --> 14:24.467
-I heard that!
-Good! Then hear this.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.700
May you lose the three hairs
left on your head!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.867
May you lose your tweezers
so your eyebrows meet

14:31.934 --> 14:34.033
to cover the wart
on your forehead!

14:35.266 --> 14:37.800
That's not a wart!
That's a beauty mark!

14:37.867 --> 14:40.000
On Sophia Loren,
it's a beauty mark.

14:40.066 --> 14:42.200
On you and Khrushchev,
it's a wart!

14:43.800 --> 14:46.700
Pop, that is enough.
Come out of the bedroom.

14:46.767 --> 14:49.100
No. She hit me.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.233
-Ma!
-With a piece of bread.

14:52.300 --> 14:55.367
Five days old.
It was like a jack handle!

14:55.433 --> 14:59.333
He deserved it after the way
he wished me a happy 50th birthday.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.233
You're 48.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.834
That's what I thought until during
<i>Your Show of Shows</i>

15:05.900 --> 15:08.467
when he hands me
some papers he found.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.800
They made a mistake
on my birth certificate

15:11.867 --> 15:15.166
when I entered this country,
and I'm actually 50.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.500
What's the difference?
You're 50.

15:17.567 --> 15:21.633
I gave him the best
years of my life,

15:21.700 --> 15:23.133
and he just stole two more!

15:25.333 --> 15:27.467
I've never been so depressed.

15:27.533 --> 15:31.800
Ma, it doesn't mean anything.
50 is just a number.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.767
You don't understand,
Dorothy.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.367
I always had plans, dreams,

15:36.433 --> 15:39.533
things I wanted
to accomplish by age 50.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.433
What kind of dreams?

15:41.500 --> 15:42.467
Well...

15:43.667 --> 15:47.667
for one thing,
I always wanted to be a ballerina.

15:47.734 --> 15:50.367
Please.
With those legs?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.967
Come out, Salvadore.
I got more bread for you.

15:54.033 --> 15:59.734
It wouldn't have been any easier
for you to break into ballet at 48.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.934
But I'd still have
two more years to dream.

16:03.934 --> 16:07.100
I can't believe it.
I'm 50.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.000
I'm an old lady who hasn't
accomplished a thing in her life.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.100
You haven't accomplished a thing?

16:16.400 --> 16:18.800
You raised three kids
during the depression

16:18.867 --> 16:21.667
and always managed to
have food on the table.

16:21.734 --> 16:24.633
You held two jobs,

16:24.700 --> 16:27.233
but somehow you were always there
when we needed you.

16:28.266 --> 16:32.000
You helped me pay
my college tuition

16:32.066 --> 16:36.166
and encouraged me whenever I
felt like giving up. Should I go on?

16:36.233 --> 16:40.133
-Because we could be here all night.
-Enough already.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.667
Ralph Edwards makes less
of a fuss over people.

16:43.767 --> 16:47.500
About this old lady business,
you're acting like an ass!

16:48.000 --> 16:51.934
You don't look 50.
You don't look 48.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.633
You're as beautiful as the day
I married you.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.400
Oh, Salvadore.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.233
Tell me that again.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.266
You're acting like an ass!

17:04.767 --> 17:05.867
He's right.

17:05.934 --> 17:08.066
Salvadore, open the door.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.633
We have a birthday party to go to.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.867
Ma.

17:26.734 --> 17:28.934
Pop, come on, you'll be late
for the party.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.967
We'll be there in about an hour,
Dorothy.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.133
Oh, Salvadore.

17:41.934 --> 17:45.300
Hey, Dorothy...
make that two hours.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.500
Wow.

17:50.533 --> 17:52.000
Happy birthday, Ma.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.367
Actually, we never got
to the party at all.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.800
There were a lot of disappointed
people that night.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.700
I wasn't one of them.

18:07.767 --> 18:11.233
Neither was your father,
if memory serves me correctly.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.567
You think this cake's ready?

18:14.633 --> 18:16.166
Roberta will be here soon.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.934
It's ready when it's ready.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.200
Doesn't make any difference.
She won't be surprised anyway.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.867
Oh, surprise birthday parties
never work.

18:23.934 --> 18:26.667
What about that surprise party
we threw for you

18:26.734 --> 18:30.700
when we first moved in?
That worked... or almost.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.667
I mean, it kind of worked.

18:35.867 --> 18:39.433
Hi, Rose.
I picked up Blanche's birthday cake.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.400
What are you doing?

18:40.467 --> 18:43.667
Decorating Blanche's birthday cake.
There, it's finished.

18:43.734 --> 18:46.033
But I told you I would
pick up the cake.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.934
Oh, I know,
but back where I come from,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.533
most people won't eat
store-bought.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.166
Rose, where you come from
most people live in windmills

18:53.233 --> 18:55.367
and make love to polka music.

18:57.633 --> 19:00.967
Stop it, Dorothy,
you're making me homesick.

19:08.066 --> 19:10.166
-We're coming!
-Who could that be?

19:10.233 --> 19:14.100
Everybody I invited is already here.
Sophia.

19:14.166 --> 19:17.700
Ma! You know you're not supposed
to leave the home.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.700
You're still recovering
from that stroke.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.934
What recovery?
I'm back 100%, knock wood.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.834
Come in.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.000
All right.

19:30.734 --> 19:35.467
Just listen. We're throwing a
surprise birthday party for Blanche.

19:35.533 --> 19:38.433
Go out to the lanai and mingle
with the other guests.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.367
Check.

19:40.433 --> 19:43.734
-What's a lanai?
-The porch.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.567
Excuse me, Krystle Carrington.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.233
Blanche will be surprised.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.934
Lucky I accidentally found out
today's her birthday.

19:56.066 --> 19:57.967
-Blanche, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

19:58.033 --> 20:01.567
I just want to take a hot bath
and forget about today.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.667
Oh, ok.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.400
No. Girls, when
I come home mad like this

20:06.467 --> 20:10.166
and say nothing's wrong,
it's up to you

20:10.233 --> 20:12.433
to draw what's really
wrong out of me.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.867
-Blanche, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

20:16.367 --> 20:17.300
Ok.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.967
Oh, all right.
Quit badgering me!

20:22.066 --> 20:25.834
I didn't want to tell you this,
but today's my birthday.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.333
Today's your birthday,
Blanche? Today?

20:28.400 --> 20:29.800
Dorothy, did you hear that?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.867
Today is Blanche's birthday!

20:31.934 --> 20:33.100
And I hate birthdays!

20:33.166 --> 20:34.834
And she hates birthdays.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.700
I hate surprise birthday
parties even more.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.734
I got a surprise birthday
party at work today.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.967
I was so upset I almost threw up.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.333
Did you hear that, Dorothy?

20:48.400 --> 20:51.367
Surprise parties make Blanche
want to throw up.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.867
Honey, go take that bath,

20:55.934 --> 21:00.066
and we'll forget the fact
that today's really your birthday.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.700
I don't see how anybody
can hate birthdays.

21:03.767 --> 21:08.467
Because they're constant reminders
that with each passing year,

21:08.533 --> 21:11.233
our bodies begin to sag,
our faces begin to wrinkle,

21:11.300 --> 21:13.400
our hair begins to turn gray.

21:13.467 --> 21:16.166
Of course, none of that's
happened to me yet.

21:17.333 --> 21:21.033
It's only a question of time
until I'll end up looking like you.

21:24.433 --> 21:27.266
Blanche, you keep that up.
You won't have that much time left.

21:28.734 --> 21:31.266
-Hi, Blanche.
-Why are you here?

21:31.333 --> 21:33.100
I'm here for your surprise
birthday party.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.033
-Oh.
-Oh.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.133
My what? What? You didn't?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.367
Of course, we didn't.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.333
Ma, there's no party.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.934
Maybe I should take you home.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.400
I know what I saw.
There's a party out there.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.400
Blanche, I guess we made a mistake.

21:49.467 --> 21:54.467
We'll send everybody home and
forget the whole thing happened.

21:54.533 --> 21:58.967
Yo, everybody!
The party is off,

21:59.033 --> 22:01.633
but you're all welcome
to come to my place

22:01.700 --> 22:03.233
if someone can tell me where it is.

22:04.533 --> 22:08.667
Roger! Edgar! Burt! Leonard!

22:08.734 --> 22:11.066
What are they all doing here?

22:11.133 --> 22:13.333
I invited everybody
in your address book.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.233
The little red one
by my nightstand?

22:18.300 --> 22:21.667
No, the little black one by your
hot body oil dispenser.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.500
Wait a minute, fellas.

22:24.567 --> 22:28.767
No need to rush off like this.
It is my birthday.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.700
Who wants to spank me first?

22:36.700 --> 22:38.800
Boy, that turned out
to be some evening.

22:38.867 --> 22:40.100
It sure did.

22:40.166 --> 22:44.533
From that night on,
I loved surprise parties.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.700
It reminded me of a party back in
St. Olaf when I was little.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.900
Big Sven and little Sven were
celebrating the first anniversary

22:52.967 --> 22:56.767
of their smoked herring
hoagie house, when big Sven--

22:56.834 --> 22:58.300
-(timer rings)
-I'll get it!

22:58.367 --> 23:00.500
It's my cake.
Stand back. I'll get it.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.667
Ma, that looks like a cookie.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.400
You put too much rum in it.

23:12.467 --> 23:15.166
Stick an umbrella in it
and serve it with straws.

23:15.233 --> 23:16.934
Everyone will think
they're at trader Vic's.

23:18.333 --> 23:21.667
Let's take it in the living room.
Roberta will be here any minute.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.300
I hope she's really surprised.
That's the best part,

23:27.367 --> 23:28.800
when you're really surprised.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.834
Surprise!

23:35.033 --> 23:37.433
-What?
-Happy birthday, Blanche.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.400
But my birthday's next week.

23:40.467 --> 23:45.033
But you said after the last time,
we couldn't surprise you again.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.934
We figured this is the only way.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
You did a great job.

23:50.066 --> 23:51.567
I don't know what to say.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.867
Say, "it's conga time!"

23:53.934 --> 23:57.467
(conga music plays)

24:14.700 --> 24:17.734
(theme music playing)
