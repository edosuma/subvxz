WEBVTT

00:27.944 --> 00:32.365
Thank God, Mom can swim, 'cause
she's clearly gone off the deep end.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.368
I mean, bro, this Gerald guy, he's
as guilty as your head is bald.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.496
Which is why now is the time
to extract her from this situation.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.167
Donna Rosewood, our mother,
the reason we're on this planet,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.918
has never been extracted
from anything.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.628
-Until now.
-I don't get it.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.297
She's not crazy, okay?

00:47.672 --> 00:48.506
So obviously this guy...

00:48.590 --> 00:50.717
He's telling her something
that makes sense.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.344
Well, he's charming, he's smart,
he's persuasive.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.347
He's a sociopath that's preying
upon a vulnerable woman.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.641
No, we are missing something.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.101
Okay, then go.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.520
Dig through everything and
figure out what that is.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.481
All right, well, you dig with me.

01:04.564 --> 01:05.732
I've already tried.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.109
She's not listening to me,
so maybe she'll listen to you.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.736
You're the deciding vote, Pipp.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.782
All right, well, no pressure. Great.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.700
You should probably pay that.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.120
-See you later.
-Great.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.706
Excuse me.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.792
I think you forgot to charge
me for the cherry limeade.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.251
Want to tell my manager?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.130
Dandelions.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.632
Crimson Clover.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.510
Are we randomly yelling
out wildflower names or...

01:33.593 --> 01:36.054
Well, the swelling on your palms,
tops of your hands.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.848
Dandelion greens, they reduce
the edema in your soft tissue.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.850
Let me guess, you play...

01:40.934 --> 01:42.185
-Volleyball.
-volleyball.

01:43.103 --> 01:43.978
So is that your move?

01:44.062 --> 01:47.023
You just go around
reading people's bodies?

01:47.398 --> 01:48.608
Cute bar trick.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.779
Mine is making men feel uncomfortable.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.490
How am I doing?

01:57.575 --> 01:59.327
I'm just messing with you.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.621
Your face though. I'm sorry.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.457
-I'm actually very impressed.
-No, I'm impressed.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.835
I'm impressed 'cause you're very good.
You had me going.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.131
So what do you say? Lummus Park Beach,
me, you, the sun, snacks.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.007
We volley, we set, we spike, I win.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.300
You play?

02:14.384 --> 02:17.720
'Cause it looks like you moisturize
your hands with brown sugar and honey.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.683
That's exactly what I do.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.434
Well, you know I got to protect
the tools.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.769
You seen that scene in Top Gun?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.896
On the beach, you know,
Maverick, Goose, Slider.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.106
All those guys playing volleyball?

02:28.189 --> 02:29.440
I put those dudes to shame.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.276
-Really?
-No, I don't.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.321
But I'm a fast learner,
and maybe you can teach me.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.615
Maybe...

02:37.699 --> 02:39.033
some other time.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.334
Yeah.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.836
That was also the Halloween where
I learned

02:49.919 --> 02:51.713
it was illegal to impersonate
an officer.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.423
Mitchie, you're wild.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.674
Thank you.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.427
Hey, Rosie. Maybe you could help me.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.096
You might not be the right person
to answer this question, but--

03:00.138 --> 03:03.433
-No, no he is. Take it from me.
-It's sort of a relationship thing.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.518
You know, I'm the person
to talk to about that stuff.

03:05.935 --> 03:06.978
Rosie, I'll see you upstairs.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.856
Christa, it was a fun talk.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.399
- Yeah, it was.
- Talk to me.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.069
Well, I met this guy online,
and he wants me to be a Sub--

03:15.153 --> 03:17.071
You know I'm not the one
to talk to about this.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.198
Dr. Rosewood.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.742
A moment of your time?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.243
Christa, get our friend some water.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.830
How can I help you?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.833
I need you to do an autopsy for me.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.712
Obviously this is for
someone very special.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.130
Your wife?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.174
A child?

03:38.718 --> 03:39.886
It's-it's for me.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.389
In 24 hours, I'm gonna be dead.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.354
What's your name?

03:49.854 --> 03:50.855
Doug.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.690
Doug Russell.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.110
Is someone threatening you, Doug?
Someone followed you here?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.654
No. Yes.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.365
I mean, it's everywhere.

04:00.823 --> 04:01.950
Always.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.868
-The people. The fire.
-The fire?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.037
Yes, they're following me.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.248
Maybe we should bring someone
in to help, like the police.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.832
No! No.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.668
No police, do you hear me?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.878
Listen, if you want my help,
you're gonna need to talk to me.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.675
Please just take the money

04:19.676 --> 04:20.927
and solve my murder.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.979
That's big.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.689
-John will love it.
-Yeah.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.066
Hey, Rosie, this is...

04:35.149 --> 04:36.818
Dr. Adrian Webb. The new M.E.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.196
I gotta say, you're better dressed
than the other detectives here.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.782
I'm not a detective. Villa, can
I borrow you for a second?

04:42.865 --> 04:45.576
-It's about a case.
-Wait, I'm sorry, now I'm confused.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.121
-Dr. Beaumont Rosewood, Jr.
-He's a private pathologist.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.956
I'm sure you've seen the billboards
all over the place.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.083
Villa, it's kinda urgent.
Can I have a sidebar?

04:52.166 --> 04:55.295
Let me think. No, I haven't. Sorry.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.171
I get it. New in town, right?
No worries.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.132
Villa? PowWow.com. ASAP.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.216
Born and raised actually.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.510
Rosie probably has a picture
on his phone he can show you.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.555
Actually, I have a picture on my phone
of a guy who just came to see me.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.848
He had a suitcase full of money

05:06.931 --> 05:08.808
talking about how someone
wants to kill him.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.018
Ooh. Bizarre!

05:10.101 --> 05:11.311
Yes, very. Where is he now?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.478
He just ran out.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.855
That's why I need you
to help me find him

05:13.938 --> 05:15.440
to make sure there's no
truth to what he's saying.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.774
-Okay.
-Wait, he's not dead?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.651
No. He's not dead.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.902
And you're a pathologist.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.863
Let me break this down
for you, Adrian.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.365
I'm not just a private pathologist.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.075
I'm Villa's de facto partner.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.661
So we solve cases, put away
the bad guy, that sort of thing.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.538
So don't be surprised
if there's not a lot

05:30.621 --> 05:32.040
of Villa's cases coming your way.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.875
Okay? Thank you, goodbye. Villa?

05:33.958 --> 05:35.626
Yep. Nah, that's cool.
Look, I'm new here.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.545
Don't want to step on any toes.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.756
Villa, you know where to find me.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.466
Yeah, and you know, where to find...
I'm up--

05:41.549 --> 05:42.633
Bullpen. Yeah.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.093
-Yes.
-No, I got it.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.013
So, that was interesting downstairs.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.098
You and Adrian.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.310
What? I was just introducing myself.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.897
Oh, okay, okay. Since when do you just
introduce yourself to people?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.025
Yeah, yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.693
Okay.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.944
Doug Russell.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.031
Thirty five,
organ donor, divorced.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.282
Oh, this is interesting.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.618
Guy's been lodging two,
sometimes three complaints

06:08.701 --> 06:10.328
a week for the last nine months

06:10.411 --> 06:12.997
against everyone and anyone
in his life.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.290
They're weird, too.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.626
Say anything about a fire
or being burned?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.544
Yes. Lots of fire talk.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.089
And here's one about the sun
not setting anymore.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.841
Rosie, the guy's a paranoid
conspiracy theorist.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.885
But who hands over
100 grand on a hunch?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.720
A paranoid conspiracy theorist.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.306
Okay look,I get it, but I am telling you,
I looked into his eyes.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.183
He truly believes he's in danger.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.770
And I got to say my gut is telling me
that I think he may be right.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.732
Sounds like this guy needs a doctor
that works on the living.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.276
Agreed, but Rosie has
a strong feeling...

06:42.360 --> 06:44.779
Hey! Ira! Get in here!

06:44.862 --> 06:46.948
- All hands on deck!
- What do you got?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.909
Uh, Rosie, gut feeling.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.369
Weird guy isn't dead,
but might be soon.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.121
And when Rosie has a...

06:53.663 --> 06:55.081
a feeling, he's usually right.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.041
Can I record what you just said
for posterity?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.543
So, so hilarious.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.545
Ira, what do you think?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.136
Oh, I get it. I tell you what I think,
you tell me it's a terrible idea,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.972
and how I should move my stuff
back down to the basement, right?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.766
Well, actually, I just figured that
you were the Captain for years,

07:13.850 --> 07:16.436
which means you have your finger on
the pulse of their instincts

07:16.519 --> 07:17.645
better than I do.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.481
So, I value your opinion

07:20.773 --> 07:22.191
in this particular scenario.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.570
Okay. Yeah. I agree with them.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.655
I mean, sure this guy seems
a few pills short

07:27.738 --> 07:29.949
of a full prescription, but...

07:30.032 --> 07:32.493
Look, the last thing you need
your first month on the job

07:32.577 --> 07:33.744
is an avoidable death.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.663
So, if it were me, I'd send them out.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.832
Have Villa put eyes on him
and see what she thinks.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.419
You must have been
a great Captain, Ira.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.837
You always have your people's backs.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.923
Hey.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.928
I respect the hell out of that.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.347
Go to work, guys.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.682
Okay.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.230
Something stinks of a set up.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.399
I mean, since when does
Slade do a shake and lock?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.067
Well, maybe he's turned a corner.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.360
Yeah, shake and lock was weird.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.155
Yeah, well, whatever it is, we need
to use it to our advantage.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.325
This Doug guy makes
muffins over on 14th.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.327
I think I need to ask him
a few questions.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.122
Doug Russell?

08:18.372 --> 08:19.540
Must be somewhere in the back.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.710
You know, I don't understand
red velvet.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.128
It doesn't taste like anything.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.505
You eat with your eyes, Villa.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.632
The rich ruby red entices
certain parts of the brain.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.384
So in essence,
it's not really about taste.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.303
And honestly,
the more I think about it,

08:32.386 --> 08:33.471
he's a really nice guy.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.764
What? Who? Slade?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.349
-Adrian.
-Again with him?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.602
Look, I'm just glad there's another
respectable person at the EMPD.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.563
An M.E. who seems to really have
a good head on his shoulders.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.357
Oh, not that you're being
even the least bit sincere.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.816
Stop it! He really does.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.903
-Big step up from what we had.
-And that's exactly my point.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.571
I'm just saying, genetically speaking,

08:51.280 --> 08:52.532
you two are a very nice match.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.160
EMPD! You know, you're just upset that
he's not a member of your fan club,

08:56.244 --> 08:57.286
like the rest of the crew.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.413
Please, he'd kill to be a member
of my fan club

08:59.497 --> 09:01.582
-'cause our monthly mailers are legit.
-Shut up.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.135
He's dead.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.857
You don't seem surprised.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.776
My brother didn't believe in banks.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.404
So he paid for everything in cash.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.073
Probably had this buried on his
property,

09:34.448 --> 09:35.324
for a rainy day.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.286
I'm sorry, but this is an awful lot
of money for a baker.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.663
No. Baking was his passion,

09:40.746 --> 09:42.206
but he made his money in tech.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.042
He sold a tracking app
to some Internet company

09:45.126 --> 09:47.336
-two years ago for millions.
-Really?

09:48.170 --> 09:51.048
Well, you should take this with you.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.258
Your brother asked me to help him,

09:52.341 --> 09:54.093
and I'm gonna do that for free.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.140
He was the world's best brother.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.311
This was my college graduation.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.231
He traveled 20 hours
straight from China.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.191
Made it just in time.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.110
When they announced my name,

10:11.277 --> 10:14.196
he cheered like I won the Super Bowl.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.407
He was so proud of me.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.287
I'm sorry.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
I just don't understand what happened.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.208
It was like someone flipped a switch

10:26.292 --> 10:29.086
and my happy-go-lucky brother

10:29.170 --> 10:33.633
was replaced by some neurotic,
petrified soul.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.802
Please, find out who killed him.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.972
He didn't deserve this.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.233
I'll figure out who did this to you.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.364
Hey, this guy could've landed
on any table.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.573
But he chose this one.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.701
He knew that if anyone could
solve this thing, it'd be you.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.413
All right,
what do you got for me?

11:04.705 --> 11:07.166
Okay, this is Doug Russell,
35 years old,

11:07.249 --> 11:08.292
no history of illness.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.544
Starting at the head, moving down
to the feet.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088
Let's do it.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.134
Wow. I never get this lucky that fast.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.552
Everything's coming up Mendelson.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.262
What do you think that is?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.598
Looks like some type of burnt
substance, maybe ash?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.643
The splatter pattern looks like
it might have been something

11:25.726 --> 11:26.811
that was flung in his direction.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.646
Like, from a lit match, maybe?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.314
Some kink gone wrong?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.900
Christa talks about these,
these couples who...

11:34.485 --> 11:35.611
I'm just gonna test it.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.656
Adrian's back.
Okay to let him up?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.200
Yes, yes, Christa. Thank you.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.037
Hey, just a few more things to sign.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.498
Okay. Well, you could have
e-mailed this over.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.041
I like to get the digits dirty.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.210
Oh, you heard that Villa was
coming by, didn't you?

11:51.669 --> 11:52.628
I did.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.547
Adrian?

11:54.630 --> 11:55.506
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.007
Wow, now we have a party.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.926
Hey! Well, look, thank you for
the paperwork.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.094
And thanks for stopping by,

12:00.177 --> 12:02.972
which I'm sure is a first of many,
many drop-ins.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.433
-Come by whenever you want.
-Sweet.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.518
Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't want
to hang out here?

12:07.601 --> 12:08.811
Actually, you know what?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.897
To be safe, maybe you should
exchange numbers with Villa.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.482
That way, if she's already coming by,

12:13.566 --> 12:14.734
-then you can...
-Rosie.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.862
Well come on now, Villa, you know I hate
it when people don't carpool if they can.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.655
You know actually, Adrian, what
are you rolling in?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.740
Maybe you should drive.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.825
As long as I can pick the music,
I'm cool.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.326
Any Chick Corea fans?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.328
I don't hate "Armando's Rhumba."

12:26.579 --> 12:27.413
Well, neither do I.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.665
And neither do I. Looky there,
looky there.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.834
You know, when I was back
in my county M.E. days,

12:31.917 --> 12:34.462
I was pushing an Oldsmobile,
Delta 88 diesel.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.256
That thing smoked more than an old man
playing dominoes in the park.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.924
But we all have to start somewhere.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.135
-Yeah.
-I think mine's a 2005.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.803
But, honestly I don't really care about
cars.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.638
Just get me from "A" to "B,"
and I'm happy.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.599
Right?

12:47.224 --> 12:49.351
Damn. I have to get back.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.146
Look forward to our carpool, Annalise.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.482
Me too.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.364
-What are you doing?
-I'm bonding with Adrian. He's a cool cat.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.909
-I know, but I--
-So you agree that he's a cool cat?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.368
Don't you have work to do?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.412
See you're deflecting.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.582
Hey, figured out what that gunk was.
It's sage.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.292
-Sage?
-Yeah.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.460
-That's interesting.
-Right?

13:14.543 --> 13:17.379
Sorry to interrupt
again, Rosie. Tawnya's here.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.131
-Tawnya?
-Oh. Tawnya. Excuse me.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.634
Tawnya the waitress?

13:22.218 --> 13:24.220
Where are you going?
It's a party, remember?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.848
So what'd happen
if I didn't come back, huh?

13:28.015 --> 13:29.517
You'd file a police report?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.602
Luckily, we'll never need
to answer that question.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.854
Oh, wow, you sound
awfully confident, Doctor.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.731
Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.107
No, no, no, no, not at all.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.319
Cobb salad, no bacon, sub avocado.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.738
Yes. Impressive.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.073
-Yeah, it is.
-Annalise.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.366
And I'm Tawnya.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.244
And I'm leaving. I just wanted
to return something.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.414
Oh, and, um, Friday night.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.166
You're driving. Top down.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.503
And no, I don't care if my hair
gets destroyed in the wind.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.463
I love hearing that.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.589
All right, bye, y'all.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.674
-See you later.
-Bye.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.886
-Tawnya.
-So, I guess I'm not the only one

14:05.970 --> 14:07.763
with new friends stopping by.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.225
How long have you been hanging out
with the waitress from our new spot?

14:11.308 --> 14:13.853
Wow. Do you have a problem with people
in the service industry?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.855
You have a problem remembering
your own jacket?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.065
You think I don't know what
a leave behind looks like?

14:18.148 --> 14:20.109
I'll admit, I've left an earring
or two in my day,

14:20.192 --> 14:23.362
but a jacket like this...
Wow, good move.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.780
Good move.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
I'm very happy for you because,
you know,

14:26.782 --> 14:29.618
genetically speaking, you're
a very good match.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.953
No, don't flip my words on me.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.622
Your words have been flipped and
applied. Nothing we can do now.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.999
I'm gonna go question Doug's ex.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.001
Well, let me go tell Mitchie
to collect some ocular fluid

14:37.084 --> 14:38.794
and get a head start on
the immunoassay screen

14:38.836 --> 14:41.005
-and I'll come with you.
-Great. You can ride shotgun

14:41.088 --> 14:42.256
while we talk about your big date.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.674
-Really?
-No.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.052
We've been divorced
about a year.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.140
And, sure, our separation was
not without its headaches.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.642
With the help of prayer and the mother

14:53.726 --> 14:56.604
of all living things, Yemaya,
we were able to build lives

14:56.687 --> 14:57.855
apart from each other.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.566
Yemaya? As in Orisha Yemaya?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.568
Very good.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.446
But I thought you knew we
both practiced Santeria.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.115
Well, that explains the sage
that we found on Doug.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.409
Lots of religions use that
to ward off evil spirits.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.952
Yeah, Santeria, like...

15:12.286 --> 15:13.203
black magic.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.165
No. And in a world full of people who
don't know what to believe,

15:16.248 --> 15:19.501
I have faith in the power
of Oshun to guide me,

15:19.585 --> 15:20.628
to show me the light.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.714
I'm sorry if I offended you, Jillian.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.008
We were hoping you could shed
some light on something.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.052
Yes, if you knew of anyone
who might have wanted

15:28.135 --> 15:29.219
to harm your ex-husband?

15:29.970 --> 15:31.013
I killed him.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.184
Who killed him?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.602
Me.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.064
I'm sorry. So-so you're saying
that you killed your ex-husband?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.482
Yes, I did.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.159
She thinks she spelled him to death?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.369
Well, not alone.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.204
She claims she had a little
help from Saint Oshun.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.665
She may be eccentric, but she believes
everything she says.

15:57.831 --> 15:58.707
Okay.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.918
Well, let me have a crack at her.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.628
-You know I love the weird ones.
-No.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.714
-No. You go in, and it's gonna get--
-It's gonna get what?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.592
Let me have a go.
I'll get some answers.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.595
Cap, are you just trying to get away
from Slade for five minutes?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.180
This guy's all over me.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.682
He's huddling over my desk,

16:14.765 --> 16:16.308
he's asking my opinion on everything.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.893
He even had me okay his lunch order.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.978
Now, that's a fail.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.522
He should definitely not be coming
to you for food advice.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.273
Ever, like ever.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.608
Hurtful.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.528
And when I told him he ordered
the best thing on the menu,

16:27.611 --> 16:28.529
I think I saw a tear.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.906
I mean, this guy is crying
over chow fun.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.866
So that's it. End of discussion.
I'm going in.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.079
Doug lived his life by the word of
the Orishas.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.915
He would understand that sometimes
you must sacrifice yourself

16:39.999 --> 16:41.000
for the good of others.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.086
Okay.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.504
Give it to me one more time.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.841
What have we got here?
An Ira Hornstock interrogation?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.801
Maybe I can learn a thing or two.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.553
You know, I feel like we can
always learn

16:52.636 --> 16:53.887
from everyone we work with.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.181
That every single person
has their own...

16:56.265 --> 16:57.850
-Special thing.
-...special...

16:57.933 --> 16:59.643
Rosie! I knew you'd get it.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.354
You seem extra engaged today.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.190
What? You're saying I'm normally
aloof and disinterested?

17:07.234 --> 17:08.235
I'm just kidding, Villa.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.029
I just can't sit still, that's it.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.531
And you know what? This case
is getting very interesting.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.826
Did you know that Doug left
all of his millions to Jillian?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.787
Let's try this.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.249
Let's pretend that you're

17:22.332 --> 17:24.251
this Blockbuster membership card.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.419
How long have you had that?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.503
I'll ask the questions.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.424
And my Villa Loca frequent
buyer card is your dead ex.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.384
Are you with me so far?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.011
-Uh-huh.
-Good.

17:34.094 --> 17:38.015
Now, you're telling me that
from all the way over here,

17:38.098 --> 17:41.935
you lit his picture on fire, put
the bad mogambo on him,

17:42.019 --> 17:45.105
and then, a few hours later,
a few hours later,

17:45.189 --> 17:47.983
he drops dead all the way over there?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.234
Is that what you're telling me?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.612
Ira, you started without me?

17:52.279 --> 17:55.199
This guy, I mean, he is always
the first one out the gate.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.533
Classic overachiever.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.993
What am I always telling you, Ira?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.870
That I'm an overachiever.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.246
Exactly, yeah.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.706
Sorry about that.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.249
I'm Captain Slade.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.543
Let me guess, you're the good cop.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.337
No, no, no, sweetheart.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.755
I'm not.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.053
Well, I'm still gonna tell you the
same thing that I just told him.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.638
I called upon the power
of the Orishas,

18:17.721 --> 18:19.181
and I killed my ex-husband.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.148
Let's put these cards away, yeah?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.317
Let's pretend for a second

18:30.400 --> 18:32.402
that we don't believe that
that's how it happened.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.529
Can you go with me there, Ira?

18:33.612 --> 18:34.863
Yeah, I think I can do that Captain.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.949
Great. Instead, we are gonna focus on

18:37.032 --> 18:39.284
this giant list of people
that your husband

18:39.368 --> 18:41.203
filed complaints against.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.122
This thing's a mile long.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.289
Okay.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.334
You've got Mr. Navidi the florist,

18:47.417 --> 18:50.712
Joseph the printer,
Brad at the drug store.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.549
A lot of talk about fire.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.093
You know anything about that?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.637
Then we have Nick, the landlord.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.597
I mean, I see ten complaints

19:00.681 --> 19:03.016
in the last two months
alone on this guy.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.977
Says here they fought a lot.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.186
With fists.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.688
Like men.

19:07.771 --> 19:08.772
Yes.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.233
Nick hated Doug.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.318
They all did.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.988
Doug had become completely unhinged
and...

19:16.738 --> 19:19.324
like a cancer to us all.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.578
Great. Okay, see? Now we're
heading in the right direction.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.663
Yeah, I'll say. Why don't you take
a look at this,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.999
and maybe you can narrow
things down for us?

19:27.082 --> 19:31.461
Come on, think nice and long
about who could have done this.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.298
You know, in case your magic
isn't as good as you think it is.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.260
Looking at this list won't do
any good.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.305
Lots and lots of people
wanted him gone,

19:41.388 --> 19:44.474
but none of them had the power
to accomplish it.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.770
Well, hopefully a few hours behind
bars will get the broad talking.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.606
Rosie, you need to get back
to the body.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.107
Try to narrow this list down for us.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.472
Mitchie, I've been looking
at your forensic photos

20:23.555 --> 20:25.057
of the back of the leg.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.226
And at first, I thought
it was a scrape.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.561
But once I flipped the image,

20:29.645 --> 20:32.564
looks like an outline of
a "B" and a "7"

20:32.648 --> 20:33.607
from a license plate.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.609
So you think somebody hit him with a car?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.194
Yeah, hard enough to cause trauma

20:37.277 --> 20:38.820
to the popliteal vein in Doug's leg.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.197
Based on my initial observation,

20:40.280 --> 20:42.199
it looked like a blood clot
had formed in that vein.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.910
But we haven't been able to find it.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.161
Wait, hold on.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.914
Now it makes sense. This is paint.

20:48.997 --> 20:51.959
Acrylic, high gloss, durable. I fished
it out from under his fingernail.

20:52.042 --> 20:56.630
And now I'm thinking that it must have
come off whatever car hit this guy.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.965
Take a look.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.258
What color do you see?

20:59.466 --> 21:02.594
It's metallic green. It came off
of a '72 Skylark.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.596
Driver's name is Nick Holmes.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.723
Nick Holmes?

21:07.224 --> 21:08.392
EMPD.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.560
I have some questions
about Doug Russell.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.450
'72 sticks in this heat.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.869
Word of advice, Nick.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.329
Innocent people don't run.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.753
The guy had gone crazy, all right?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.797
He started attacking customers.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.133
Not just his.
Screamed at other merchants.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.010
He ever mention anything
to you about a fire?

21:43.093 --> 21:45.178
Maybe something burning down?
His house?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.805
Honestly, at a certain point,

21:46.888 --> 21:48.890
I stopped listening
to anything he said.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.058
He was a menace.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.936
Now, I'll admit we came
to blows once or twice.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.980
But I have to protect my investment.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.356
Came to blows?

21:56.565 --> 21:59.192
Is that what the kids are calling
vehicular manslaughter these days?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.528
What? He's dead?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.238
I didn't hit him with anything.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.282
Well the metallic green paint
under his fingernails

22:05.365 --> 22:06.450
tells us a different story.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.868
I just...

22:08.118 --> 22:08.994
I pinned him.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.997
It was a light pinning between his car
and mine.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.000
The guy was a nut bag,

22:15.083 --> 22:17.461
and I had to protect myself when
I served him with the papers.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.047
Well, your little stunt caused
a blood clot to form in his leg,

22:20.505 --> 22:21.798
and that traveled up to his lung.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.300
That's manslaughter.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.806
I never meant to hurt him.
I was only trying to scare him.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.102
I cannot believe this is happening.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.023
Thank you so much
for finding out

22:38.106 --> 22:39.399
what happened to my brother.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.776
It means so much to our family

22:40.859 --> 22:42.402
that Doug can finally rest in peace.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.363
Nadine, can I ask you a question?

22:44.738 --> 22:47.407
-Something is been bothering me.
-Of course.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.868
It was the Santeria, wasn't it?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.036
That made Doug change?

22:51.244 --> 22:54.289
No. He loved Santeria
since we were kids.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.417
Our grandfather practiced.
They were very close.

22:57.501 --> 23:01.338
It used to bring him so much joy,
but then he sold the business.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.340
He couldn't handle the success?

23:03.423 --> 23:07.344
No. Money didn't change Doug,
but, something else did.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.971
I just don't know what.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.391
And I guess I never will.

23:14.142 --> 23:14.976
Something wrong?

23:15.310 --> 23:16.770
No, no, it's probably nothing.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.355
Thanks again, for everything.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.071
I know that look.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.990
That's your "We missed
something" gaze.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.700
It's eerily similar to the...

23:30.992 --> 23:32.994
"You ate my lunch out of the fridge"
stare.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.621
Weird, it is.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.456
Which I'm still sorry about,
by the way.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.583
I mean, do I think we should put
Post-its on all of our snacks?

23:38.667 --> 23:39.876
-Absolutely.
-I was wrong.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.169
No, I was wrong.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.838
I mean, what are the chances
of two men

23:42.921 --> 23:44.881
bringing banh mi into the office
at the same time?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.758
Something changed Doug's personality.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.177
I wonder if it was
at a chemical level.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.430
Turns out it's hard
to convince your Captain

23:51.513 --> 23:53.306
to re-open a case
when Nick already confessed

23:53.390 --> 23:55.058
and we don't have
anything else to go on.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.352
Mitchie, where are the results
for Doug's antibody test?

23:57.727 --> 23:59.438
In the file marked "Didn't run them."

23:59.813 --> 24:00.647
Didn't run them?

24:00.730 --> 24:02.065
What? Our guy showed
no signs of anything

24:02.149 --> 24:03.817
that would require
cerebrospinal fluid.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.653
Hey, what's going on with you?

24:06.736 --> 24:09.531
What's going on is Doug showed
irritability, depression,

24:09.614 --> 24:11.575
suicidal and aggressive tendencies.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.785
I think that we are dealing
with a chronic infection

24:13.869 --> 24:15.745
by a Spirochete bacterium
causing Lyme disease,

24:15.829 --> 24:17.038
but there's no way to be sure

24:17.122 --> 24:18.206
since the body's sitting
in some funeral home.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.208
So you're saying someone
weaponized Lyme disease?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.294
I'm saying that we gave
the body away too soon.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.462
But that's on me.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.339
Right now, we need to figure
out a way to get that body back

24:26.423 --> 24:28.258
and run as many tests as we can.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.385
Or we're never gonna figure out
who killed Doug.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.761
Hey, thanks
for the ride along.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.054
I had to get away from Slade.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.223
The guy brought me a cup of joe
to my desk.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.892
Four sugars and heavy cream.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.727
-Just the way I like it.
-Oh, really?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.104
Yes, really.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.606
That's so much sugar.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.691
And I thought my mom had you on skim?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.277
You think I'm gonna drink that crap
when I'm not at home?

24:49.529 --> 24:52.699
-Look at this.
-I agree that it's weird.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.785
I know, it's like drinking
white-colored water.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.954
No, I meant Slade's attitude.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.623
I mean, I'm sure it's fine.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.875
Maybe he thinks you guys are friends.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.251
Well, we worked one case together,

25:03.335 --> 25:05.128
so I don't think that's happening.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.173
Well, I mean, maybe he needs a pal
and doesn't know how to ask.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.551
I doubt it. The guy runs the joint.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.847
This Santeria stuff freaks me out.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.558
Hey, you don't got to tell me.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.019
I saw old lady Genovese
put the malocchio

25:21.102 --> 25:23.063
to Bobby Bragadello
in the fifth grade.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.314
Kid never played ball again.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.735
The evil eye. That stuff's legit.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.278
I heard you were looking for me.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.364
Yes, we had a couple questions
for you.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.115
Doug's case has been reopened.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.617
It wasn't a blood clot.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.410
Is everything okay?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.538
Yes, Hunter, they're just here
to talk to us.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.665
Hunter? You're the butcher.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.166
Your shop is next to Doug's bakery.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.669
You guys all part of a Doug
support group or something?

25:45.752 --> 25:49.256
He was just a very sick man who
was in desperate need of help.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.508
So, you're dating the man who owns
the shop next door,

25:51.591 --> 25:53.468
but you didn't think
that was relevant, Jillian?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.387
Well, they're engaged.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.138
Not the size of the rock that matters,

25:57.222 --> 25:59.140
but that thing is tiny.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.935
And since you happen to know
everyone around him so well,

26:02.018 --> 26:05.146
we figured maybe you could
zero us in on our next suspect.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.857
You want suspects? Go talk to Sammy.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.401
He owned the bookstore next to Doug.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.320
Or shifty Nick. That guy was always
working an angle.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.822
And Sally with the food truck,
she used to park

26:13.905 --> 26:15.031
in front of Doug's bake shop.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.826
The smell of tater tots and hot dogs
drove him nuts.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.412
This Sally woman, she serve all day?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.164
You want something else?

26:23.748 --> 26:25.292
I want a written statement.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.627
Where you were and who you
were with when Doug died.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.888
I guess you didn't leave
the coffee pot on.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.307
That's fine.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.435
'Cause I've been wanting
to speak with you, too.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.647
Okay. So...

26:47.939 --> 26:51.818
I have gone and checked over everything
that Rosie had on Gerald's case,

26:52.068 --> 26:53.778
along with everything
you had given him

26:54.070 --> 26:55.280
from his lawyers.

26:55.363 --> 26:58.783
I'm so glad
that you finally took the time,

26:58.867 --> 27:00.660
but please, dear, let me go first?

27:01.369 --> 27:04.331
I have wasted so much
time and energy on this,

27:04.414 --> 27:06.499
and I just want to say that I am...

27:07.500 --> 27:08.668
I'm sorry.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.048
For putting you both through it, too.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.674
I am very glad to hear you say that.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.093
Mom, we're just so happy that
you're stepping away from this.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.054
Because that's what
this meeting was about.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.221
Ambush.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.890
Did you really think

27:21.973 --> 27:24.851
that I couldn't figure out

27:25.060 --> 27:26.478
that this was a setup?

27:26.978 --> 27:31.024
Son, you haven't left an appliance on
since you were eight years old.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.485
And let me understand this, Pippy.

27:33.568 --> 27:36.988
You are content to condemn
a man to life in prison

27:37.072 --> 27:39.991
that you haven't had the decency
to sit across from

27:40.325 --> 27:42.410
to hear his side of the story.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.205
- I know, but I read.
- You read?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.459
Please.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.473
Here's your package, Cap.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.850
-Thank you.
-Yep.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.686
Hey, Mac,

28:07.936 --> 28:11.606
-I don't think this is for me.
-You're the Captain, aren't you?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.317
Hornstock?

28:14.776 --> 28:16.695
I've got bad news and worse news,
which do you want first?

28:16.778 --> 28:18.321
-I don't care.
-Okay, the bad news...

28:18.405 --> 28:21.908
It doesn't matter where Jillian,
Hunter, weird Sammy,

28:21.991 --> 28:23.910
or Sally's food truck were where
when Doug died.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.036
-Why not?
-Worse news...

28:25.120 --> 28:27.288
Now Rosie thinks Doug was
killed by some type of poison.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.665
But that it happened months ago.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.500
-We've got bupkis.
-Well, not exactly.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.503
I noticed this in one of the vials

28:33.586 --> 28:35.088
that we saw at Jillian's house.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.091
I did some digging and remembered
an old case from my rookie year.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.010
It turns out, in the right dosage,
oleander can kill you.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.137
I gave Rosie a heads up.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.139
So Jillian had it sitting out
by the sugar.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.516
Poor bastard probably thought
she was making him some tea

28:46.599 --> 28:49.477
then mixes in the milk not
realizing she's killing him.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.146
Even if she didn't use this,

28:51.229 --> 28:53.481
I don't buy her innocent
priestess routine.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.774
Bitch knows what's up.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.527
I'm getting a warrant,
and we're going back to her house.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.863
She wants to admit
to killing her husband?

28:59.946 --> 29:00.947
Fine.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.907
I'm gonna find out
how she actually did it.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.749
Mitchie, stop beating yourself up.
It was just a mistake.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.668
I mean, sure, it was big enough
that Rosie needed to call me in,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.211
but we're gonna solve this.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.880
She's right, but we're gonna
need you with us.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.173
-You gonna be cool?
-Yeah.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.966
What did the oleander
test results yield?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.761
Ekkert. That's "nothing"
in Icelandic.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.221
'Cause I figure, if I'm gonna suck,
I might as well suck in style.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.348
Have you ever seen
an Icelandic person?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.351
-Mmm, crazy hot.
-Yeah, crazy hot.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.895
It's like a tough guy, Thor vibe.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.521
You think you might want
to help me turn the body?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.106
-We need to pull some spinal fluid.
-Yes.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.735
On three. One, two...

29:48.953 --> 29:50.997
-I should have run that test.
-Would you let it go?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.758
All right, pull it up.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.139
An encapsulated yeast cell.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.225
You were right. Holy cow!

30:10.308 --> 30:11.684
Hold your applause.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.647
It was just an air bubble.
We need to run it again.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.816
No, we don't.
Mitchie, you're a genius.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.652
I am? I am. Why?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.237
Because Doug was poisoned.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.738
And I know who did it.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.492
Hey, Cap.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.120
Sorry to bother you, but this was
dropped off for me by mistake.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.876
Sorry about your old man.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.004
I recognized the name
on the envelope.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.965
That Jamison guy...

30:42.048 --> 30:44.008
He's a really good estate attorney.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.845
He helped me out when my ex,
Janice, passed.

30:47.512 --> 30:48.680
May she rest.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.518
He's dead, we're alive.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.144
We need to move on.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.563
Come on, man.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.065
Who do you think
you're fooling with this...

30:59.148 --> 31:00.483
This tough guy routine?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.318
You haven't been yourself for days.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.738
You're inserting yourself into cases.
Your head's all fogged up,

31:05.822 --> 31:09.993
sitting in here working away
on what I assume is a eulogy.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.622
Now, you don't crumple
that many drafts of something

31:14.706 --> 31:17.292
unless you're struggling
to find the right words.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.544
So you're either writing
vows for a secret wedding,

31:19.627 --> 31:20.795
or it's a eulogy.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.719
Cap, I lost my dad when I was 13.

31:28.928 --> 31:32.891
I was young, and I remember it
like it was yesterday.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.310
You try to act like everything's okay

31:36.686 --> 31:38.605
so no one sees the mess inside.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.691
But I couldn't hide
that look in my eye.

31:42.609 --> 31:43.735
And neither can you.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.658
Is that all?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.758
Hey, you got to relax your shoulders.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.384
Or shake out your hands a little bit.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.802
We need these people to trust us.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.013
-Right now, you scream cop.
-I have a warrant.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.306
And I don't need their trust.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.767
-And what's wrong with my shoulders?
-You're a little tense.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.352
These are a spiritual people.
They pick up on that stuff.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.645
No, you pick up on that stuff.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.729
That's 'cause I'm spiritual people.

32:19.812 --> 32:22.190
What are you? Do you not remember
the whole oleander thing?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.233
Do you really think these people
are trying to kill their guests?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.153
This smells like a mixture of

32:27.236 --> 32:29.781
limeade, cucumber
and ginger beer to me.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.451
And it's good.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.577
Look, Villa, listen.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.622
Now, once you start waving that paper
around, it's gonna cause a scene.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.666
People are going to clam up,
and we need to get a confession.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.417
-Okay.
-So, we got to keep it

32:41.501 --> 32:44.379
-on the low-key, incognito tip, okay?
-I know.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.881
And we got to figure out
if this was an accident...

32:48.841 --> 32:49.676
or a murder.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.345
-You're loving this, aren't you?
-I am loving it!

32:55.723 --> 32:59.435
I never expected to see you here.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.274
Your mother,
she brags about you all the time,

33:05.358 --> 33:06.985
your wonderful singing voice.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.529
So proud of her children.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.576
Well, I assume from your...

33:16.119 --> 33:18.955
lack of responses that your brother
has told you all about me.

33:20.039 --> 33:24.419
Gerald, I need you to tell me
what you told my mother.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.590
Because when I leave here,
I'm either siding with her

33:29.674 --> 33:31.092
or I'm siding with my brother.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.680
And I don't have to tell you which way
you need this to go.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.071
Doug's complaints.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.531
The fire.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.701
My gut is telling me Doug was
at a ceremony just like this

33:56.951 --> 33:59.871
and he was poisoned
with something just like that.

33:59.954 --> 34:04.876
Friends, believers, tonight is
a time to celebrate.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.628
A night when the Orishas open
their arms

34:07.712 --> 34:09.839
and welcome new members
into our family.

34:10.965 --> 34:14.677
But first we must deal
with our uninvited guests.

34:16.095 --> 34:19.223
Did you think you could surprise us,
Detectives?

34:19.307 --> 34:21.642
That we wouldn't be ready...

34:21.809 --> 34:23.853
to welcome you with open arms?

34:23.936 --> 34:25.980
Actually the surprise was that drink.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.106
The limeade and the ginger beer?

34:27.190 --> 34:30.568
Ooh. Wee. Hit the spot.

34:30.651 --> 34:34.363
These Santeria ceremonies
usually this weird?

34:34.447 --> 34:35.782
I don't think this is Santeria.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.746
Okay, we have to do something.

34:41.829 --> 34:42.955
All right, just let me think.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.332
Just be cool.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.334
East Miami PD! Everybody step back!

34:46.417 --> 34:48.461
-Just step back.
-Really? Really, really?

34:48.544 --> 34:49.712
Do you know what cool means?

34:49.796 --> 34:52.340
Let me guess. You're here to harass us
with more questions about Doug?

34:52.423 --> 34:54.050
Actually I'm glad you mentioned that,
Hunter.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.552
'Cause Doug was a really good guy

34:56.719 --> 34:58.054
who suddenly came into a lot of money.

34:58.137 --> 35:00.181
But unfortunately in his case,

35:00.264 --> 35:01.516
money couldn't buy him happiness.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.143
-It rarely ever does.
-I mean, it ruined your marriage.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.561
He gave you this house.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.813
Everyone moved on, right?

35:06.896 --> 35:09.232
But then someone found out
that if Doug died,

35:09.899 --> 35:11.234
they would inherit his fortune.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.944
Hunter, you were
in love with Jillian.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.029
But you wanted all that cash,
didn't you?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.406
The perfect murder
leads to the perfect life.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.492
No more whacking away
at meat for you, right?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.619
-This is pure insanity.
-Or is it?

35:21.702 --> 35:25.540
Actually, I can prove that Doug
was infected during an eyebale.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.626
That's a blood sacrifice for those
of you playing at home.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.836
What are you talking about?

35:29.919 --> 35:32.421
It's funny. We've traced
license plates,

35:32.505 --> 35:34.715
phone calls, but we've never
traced blood before.

35:34.799 --> 35:38.427
It's surprisingly easy when you know
what animal it came from.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.471
What is she talking about?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.474
Doug suffered from New Variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.643
It had been eating away at his brain
for the last nine months.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.395
You might know it as mad cow.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.314
And this is Doug's blood.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.692
Once you're infected,
then your blood is infected.

35:52.775 --> 35:55.820
If Hunter is telling the truth
then no one here would mind if we just

35:55.903 --> 35:57.697
used his blood
for the ceremony tonight, right?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.869
See, this may look like blood,

36:04.287 --> 36:05.288
but it's actually...

36:09.250 --> 36:11.127
It's the final nail in your coffin.

36:12.378 --> 36:13.880
Drink up.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.967
Okay, yeah, I did it.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.345
Doug was a lunatic who needed
to be put out of his misery.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.347
And I knew this mumbo jumbo wasn't
gonna do it.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.642
Mumbo jumbo? How dare you?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.477
I trusted you!

36:29.478 --> 36:32.315
And you're the reason
that Doug went crazy?

36:33.316 --> 36:37.028
Hunter, you're under arrest
for the murder of Doug Russell.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.325
So, Villa, that was grenadine.
It tastes like cherry syrup.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.035
-Just say cherry syrup.
-Okay, well,

36:44.118 --> 36:45.620
-I said cherry syrup.
-No, you didn't.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.747
I just said grenadine
tastes like cherry syrup.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.123
-Cherry syrup.
-That's what I said.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.250
I said, "It tastes like cherry syrup."

36:53.002 --> 36:55.171
Obviously, you both know
I went to see Gerald.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.464
I sat with him.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.760
I listened to him, and I asked
more questions

37:00.843 --> 37:02.511
than I even realized I had.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.558
And I don't think he did it.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.726
Wait, what?

37:10.019 --> 37:12.104
Pipp, the man brutally
murdered two people.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.732
He's taking advantage of her.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.526
Bro, you've been so worried
about Mom's feelings for Gerald

37:17.610 --> 37:20.488
when this has really been all
about your feelings for Mom.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.825
Now, you are the best son
and the best brother there is.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.912
But your feelings
are getting in the way here.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.872
I let Gerald explain what happened.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.499
I know. I heard the same explanation.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.959
Did you really listen to him?

37:33.042 --> 37:34.293
His version of it?

37:34.377 --> 37:35.711
Did you listen to his words?

37:35.836 --> 37:38.005
I mean, this man,
he bared his soul to me.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.715
And I felt his innocence.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.384
You felt it?

37:41.592 --> 37:43.427
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Well, I'm sorry.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.973
But this makes sense to both of us.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.360
Hey, Ira, I want your report
on the George Banks case

37:59.443 --> 38:00.987
on my desk first thing in
the morning.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.029
I got a meeting with the chief.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.448
I just want to make sure
everything's in order, all right?

38:04.740 --> 38:05.741
You got it.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.413
I'm sorry...

38:11.414 --> 38:13.833
for always busting your balls.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.252
I just sometimes have a...

38:17.670 --> 38:19.714
A hard time connecting with people.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.882
We're all good, Cap.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.384
I mean the truth is, I haven't even

38:23.467 --> 38:26.178
seen the bastard in over 30 years.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.431
The guy walked out on me and my mom.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.434
Didn't even have the decency
to come back when she gave me up.

38:33.519 --> 38:36.355
What am I supposed to say
about someone I don't even know?

38:39.233 --> 38:41.694
I bet your dad was great, you know?

38:42.403 --> 38:44.613
Loyal, hard working, compassionate.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.200
I mean, that's what a father's
supposed to pass down to his son.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.038
And all I got was his bank account.

38:52.538 --> 38:56.500
But, you know, I'm gonna go see
the guy one last time.

38:58.627 --> 38:59.795
To say goodbye.

39:04.550 --> 39:05.926
Okay, so let me tell you.

39:06.927 --> 39:10.139
Our landlord
had messed with us for years.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.809
I mean, hiking the rent up,
and this place was a dump.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.520
Stuff was broken everywhere,
the pipes were leaking,

39:16.604 --> 39:17.605
the toilets were a mess.

39:18.272 --> 39:21.275
So, one morning, I got up early,

39:21.359 --> 39:23.569
I marched right over to his spot,

39:23.652 --> 39:26.280
and I lit a match right up
under his smoke detector.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.408
10 seconds later... Bam!

39:29.492 --> 39:31.369
Water starts spraying all over
the place,

39:31.452 --> 39:32.578
the alarm starts blaring,

39:32.661 --> 39:35.081
people start running out of
the complex, "What is going on?"

39:35.164 --> 39:39.960
Just to see him crying over
his ruined record collection.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.922
-So that's how you do it?
-That's exactly how I do it.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.092
I mean, 99% of it's true.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.885
I mean, the story's completely true,

39:47.968 --> 39:49.970
except I wasn't
the mastermind behind it.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.935
My daughter was.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.818
So, I'm...

40:05.111 --> 40:06.862
I'm gonna pay for this meal.

40:07.154 --> 40:10.324
And tell you thank you
for a lovely evening.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.909
Because...

40:13.786 --> 40:15.996
usually after I tell guys about her,

40:16.789 --> 40:20.209
they always give me the look
you have on your face right now

40:20.292 --> 40:22.086
and I never see them again.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.713
And I wouldn't want you to think
that I'm just in this for food,

40:24.797 --> 40:26.424
which was excellent, by the way.

40:28.217 --> 40:31.095
She's the most important
thing in my life

40:31.178 --> 40:33.556
and the best thing
that I've ever done.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.517
And I would never force her

40:36.600 --> 40:39.228
to meet someone who didn't
want to meet her, too.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.190
So... I'm...

40:48.237 --> 40:49.405
What's your daughter's name?

40:52.992 --> 40:54.160
Kayla.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.588
Hey.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.882
Sorry about all this blood.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.592
It's terrible.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.385
It's gross.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.761
I'm sorry that I work down here.

41:12.845 --> 41:13.846
I'm not.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.265
Good.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.770
I just came down here to say that if

41:21.979 --> 41:23.647
you ever wanted someone to show you

41:23.731 --> 41:25.858
the ropes around here
who isn't Feldheim...

41:26.275 --> 41:27.651
Yeah, he's a little off, isn't he?

41:28.777 --> 41:30.112
I'd be down for that.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.074
Wow. Uh...

41:35.451 --> 41:36.410
Okay.

41:37.786 --> 41:40.206
Yeah, maybe we could go off campus.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.001
I heard Leila's has
a great salsa night.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.711
-You heard that?
-Yeah.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.548
Well, you know, a sharply dressed
bald birdy

41:49.632 --> 41:50.925
might have told me about it.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.927
I just have to ask, though,

41:54.428 --> 41:55.513
you and Rosewood,

41:57.056 --> 41:58.474
you guys ever...

41:58.933 --> 42:00.851
I thought I sensed an energy,
you know,

42:01.101 --> 42:02.478
and I just don't want to get
in the middle of something

42:02.561 --> 42:03.938
-if it's--
-No.

42:06.106 --> 42:07.650
We're just really good friends.
