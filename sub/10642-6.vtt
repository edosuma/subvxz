00:00.047 --> 00:01.577
Previously on "The Family."

00:01.577 --> 00:04.030
- I'd like to order that cake.
- I'm just gonna grab the box.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.705
- I'll eat it here.
- Okay.

00:05.705 --> 00:06.897
Enjoy.

00:06.898 --> 00:10.083
- I paid a fine, I registered...
- Then they're gonna see this...

00:10.084 --> 00:11.258
Please turn it off.

00:11.283 --> 00:12.821
You're the one that likes it,
'cause they're so little.

00:12.822 --> 00:13.736
Enough!

00:13.737 --> 00:16.106
It's gonna stop now,
you sleeping with my husband.

00:16.107 --> 00:17.254
Do you think you're special?

00:17.255 --> 00:18.605
You wouldn't believe how many women

00:18.606 --> 00:20.715
take their panties off
for the dad who lost his son.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.605
I think he's lonely.
I think he misses him.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.735
I know how to get him.

00:24.736 --> 00:26.704
We'll be done with it, and you
can move on with your lives.

00:26.705 --> 00:27.606
How?

00:27.607 --> 00:29.655
I need to use Adam as bait.

00:29.656 --> 00:32.415
- Danny's not home.
- I left something up in his room.

00:32.415 --> 00:35.305
- She's a reporter.
- She's a blogger.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.515
This is Adam's room.

00:36.516 --> 00:38.102
I know who you are.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.593
Gus. Paternity test.
I got the results back.

00:41.594 --> 00:43.636
It's not him.

00:46.636 --> 00:48.369
Being alone changes you.

00:48.409 --> 00:50.314
_

00:51.636 --> 00:54.175
Come! Touch. All right.

00:54.176 --> 00:56.810
Other voices disappear...

01:00.606 --> 01:03.000
until you only hear your own.

01:11.476 --> 01:13.400
And when you start to listen to it?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.657 --> 01:31.557
Touch. Touch. Yeah.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.550
You become capable of anything.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:51.050 --> 01:53.416
We can draw him out.
He'll take the risk.

01:53.471 --> 01:54.469
_

01:54.494 --> 01:55.681
He misses Adam that much.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.588
- Oh, can we please just not...
- How would it work?

01:57.589 --> 01:59.099
It'll be in a public place.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.704
He was taken from a public place.

02:00.705 --> 02:03.119
We'll have agents everywhere.
He'll never even get close.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.099
No, but, he'll be watching,
he'll be right there.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.069
Yeah, but, so we can get him.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.535
And then it's over.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.160
What do we have to do?

02:21.040 --> 02:23.429
Send the bastard a message
and hope he gets it.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.618
He bought me a red plaid shirt.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.918
He liked me to wear it.

02:33.210 --> 02:35.080
He'll get the message.

02:39.950 --> 02:42.149
- Adam!
- Adam?!

02:42.150 --> 02:44.480
- I have a question!
- How are you feeling?

02:44.481 --> 02:45.691
Okay, okay, guys.

02:45.692 --> 02:47.139
I'm a public figure,
my son is not, so...

02:47.140 --> 02:49.159
What did you miss most, Adam?

02:49.160 --> 02:51.210
Just being normal.

02:51.784 --> 02:53.945
- Doing normal things.
- Uh, like what?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.789
Ah, I don't... I don't know.

02:55.790 --> 03:01.327
I-I guess just... friends
and movies and swimming,

03:02.233 --> 03:05.149
pizza, Bill's Burgers.

03:05.150 --> 03:07.079
On his wish list...

03:07.080 --> 03:09.547
movies and Bill's Burgers
at the Kensington Mall.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.064
And what did you miss most, Adam?

03:12.547 --> 03:14.239
Just being normal.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.119
Doing normal things.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.219
Like what?

03:17.220 --> 03:20.029
Ah, I don't... I don't know.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.129
I-I guess just... friends and...

03:22.130 --> 03:24.179
I'm enjoying
this helpless and pregnant act.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.029
I can tell.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.199
...pizza... Bill's Burgers.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.239
Oh, you had one yet?

03:30.240 --> 03:32.099
Uh, maybe tomorrow.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.080
Thanks, guys.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.109
Got the sports section?

03:39.250 --> 03:41.220
Good morning.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.099
You sold me the cake.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.960
Yeah, I sold you the cake.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.611
What are you doing here?

03:51.636 --> 03:53.783
Uh, you forgot your rewards card.

03:55.205 --> 03:56.556
I never signed up.

03:56.832 --> 03:57.787
I signed you up.

03:58.623 --> 04:02.059
I figured anybody who houses
a six-layer buttercream

04:02.060 --> 04:03.781
on his own should benefit.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.109
Thank you.

04:07.110 --> 04:09.240
Uh! Do you have a girlfriend?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.239
No.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.168
Uh, or a wife?

04:16.170 --> 04:19.149
I-I'm... no, I-I'm only asking

04:19.149 --> 04:23.830
because you seem so comfortable
eating by yourself,

04:24.180 --> 04:26.830
and I don't know how to do that...

04:27.150 --> 04:29.180
eat by myself at a restaurant.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.100
So basically, I never go out.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.249
Just bring a book.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.239
God, I'm so bad at this.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.130
What I'm trying to say is...

04:40.950 --> 04:43.330
if you ever want to not eat alone...

04:46.220 --> 04:49.330
we could not eat alone together.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.353
What's so urgent?

05:06.074 --> 05:07.184
I have to show you something.

05:07.653 --> 05:10.353
I'm not interested in your lady parts.

05:10.774 --> 05:12.133
It's a paternity test.

05:12.134 --> 05:13.608
You're wasting your time.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.063
Danny doesn't have any money.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.590
It's Adam.

05:46.124 --> 05:47.211
You don't want to comment?

05:47.726 --> 05:50.265
What do you want me to say?
Congratulations?

05:50.609 --> 05:52.539
You must be very proud.

05:52.540 --> 05:55.173
It's quite a move up
from girl-on-girl features.

05:55.174 --> 05:56.392
How about the truth?

05:57.189 --> 05:58.296
Is that's what's important?

05:58.321 --> 05:59.314
Isn't it?

05:59.806 --> 06:01.479
Not to you.

06:02.214 --> 06:04.354
You want a five-word headline.

06:04.988 --> 06:06.294
You want a hero and a villain.

06:06.295 --> 06:08.346
You want "is he?" Or "isn't he?"

06:09.284 --> 06:13.323
And the truth is... he's both.

06:13.324 --> 06:15.476
He's my brother
and he's not my dad's son.

06:16.015 --> 06:17.343
I... I don't...

06:17.344 --> 06:20.003
My mom had an affair 20 years ago.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.052
My dad's having one now.

06:22.053 --> 06:24.646
They're not perfect people...
live at 11:00.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.233
Print this trash, and you shatter a kid

06:30.234 --> 06:32.601
who spent 10 years missing a man
he thought was his father.

06:33.461 --> 06:37.334
But I guess he's already in
pieces, so the more the merrier.

06:39.424 --> 06:40.720
Don't text me again.

06:48.526 --> 06:50.739
Hi, we're running a campaign
together, remember?

06:50.740 --> 06:52.406
You might want to start calling me back.

06:53.216 --> 06:54.756
What if it's not him?

06:56.041 --> 06:58.486
I know... I know.
It sounds crazy and maybe it is,

06:58.486 --> 07:01.445
but there's just...
He's different, okay?

07:01.446 --> 07:04.012
I mean... ever since the moment
when we saw him at the hospital,

07:04.013 --> 07:06.613
there's been something off about him.

07:07.546 --> 07:08.303
He's different.

07:08.358 --> 07:10.556
RNC wants our student loan
restructure plan today.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.013
And is Claire still having lunch

07:12.014 --> 07:13.491
with the Housing Commissioner tomorrow?

07:13.569 --> 07:14.678
Why can't you just be happy he's back?

07:14.679 --> 07:16.549
Because he's not back.

07:18.749 --> 07:20.275
We should get on debate prep, too.

07:20.276 --> 07:21.785
You know Lang's already on it.

07:22.549 --> 07:24.609
You want Chinese? I'm buying.

07:28.629 --> 07:30.718
Hello?

07:30.719 --> 07:32.875
Willa, you okay?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.355
I'm your sister, Ad.

07:38.782 --> 07:40.120
I know.

07:41.784 --> 07:43.599
I'm your sister.

07:44.699 --> 07:45.748
I know.

08:29.172 --> 08:30.217
Seriously?

08:30.702 --> 08:31.895
Did I wake you?

08:31.896 --> 08:34.692
That would require being able
to actually fall asleep.

08:34.692 --> 08:35.760
I'm sorry.

08:35.761 --> 08:38.212
I'm just... I want to get
this done before tomorrow.

08:38.214 --> 08:39.671
What's tomorrow?

08:39.672 --> 08:41.770
It's that Candidate's Night
thing in the city.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.691
I thought I'd try
and round up some business.

08:43.692 --> 08:44.736
Teak?

08:44.761 --> 08:45.775
And beechwood.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.792
I upped my game.

08:48.518 --> 08:51.418
Some kid's gonna be psyched
at Christmas.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.373
I'll try and keep it down.

08:54.373 --> 08:55.875
I can take the power tools or the music,

08:55.876 --> 08:57.815
just not both at once.

09:35.552 --> 09:40.512
Oh... Honey. It's so late.

09:42.365 --> 09:44.295
What if he doesn't see me?

09:46.137 --> 09:47.607
What do you mean?

09:48.495 --> 09:50.565
I look different.

09:53.872 --> 09:54.992
Oh, my God, you're sweating.

09:55.485 --> 09:56.751
It's hot.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.786
Yeah.

10:00.910 --> 10:01.926
Let's drive up the coast.

10:02.270 --> 10:03.379
What do you mean?

10:03.380 --> 10:07.299
See Kennebunkport,
the lighthouses... just you me.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.459
Let's just go away, right now.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.741
And let's just forget
about the whole thing.

10:11.933 --> 10:13.310
I can't.

10:14.055 --> 10:15.670
Why not?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.920
I can't forget till he's gone.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.669
I can't.

10:36.740 --> 10:40.859
Okay. Well... you said
he likes you in red.

10:43.830 --> 10:46.340
You'll be able to see and hear
everything from the van.

10:47.006 --> 10:48.056
What's that?

10:48.174 --> 10:49.525
- It's a tracking device.
- What for?

10:49.643 --> 10:51.150
Standard protocol, just in case.

10:51.298 --> 10:52.733
In case you lose him?

10:53.330 --> 10:54.723
He'll be surrounded by our people.

10:54.723 --> 10:56.702
I don't care.
He is not doing this alone.

10:56.703 --> 10:58.783
- I'll go with him.
- You're too high profile.

10:58.808 --> 11:01.678
It won't work if you're...

11:02.823 --> 11:04.773
What?

11:13.873 --> 11:15.823
You gonna eat that?

11:18.603 --> 11:20.713
Want to play spot the G-Man?

11:24.803 --> 11:26.210
11:00.

11:26.235 --> 11:28.173
Cinnabon. Old lady in a wheelchair.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.196
She's, like, 80.

11:30.373 --> 11:31.419
Yeah.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.102
It's called a cover.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.990
Dude... they're gonna catch him.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.820
I don't want them to catch him.

11:45.843 --> 11:46.972
Why?

11:49.112 --> 11:51.071
I want them to kill him.

11:51.554 --> 11:54.534
We'll have eyes on every inch of
this mall in about two minutes.

11:54.636 --> 11:56.666
More like 10, sir.

11:57.135 --> 11:58.398
Why can't you believe in yourself

11:58.423 --> 11:59.833
the way I believe in you, Jerry?

12:06.509 --> 12:07.528
You should go.

12:07.529 --> 12:08.529
What'd he say?

12:08.530 --> 12:09.808
What?

12:10.549 --> 12:12.528
He won't come close if you're near.

12:12.529 --> 12:13.904
Hey, I'm not just
gonna leave you here, okay?

12:13.904 --> 12:16.288
He'll see you and then he'll leave.

12:16.409 --> 12:17.744
You don't know that.

12:17.769 --> 12:18.976
I know him.

12:20.149 --> 12:21.448
Just go.

12:23.109 --> 12:24.748
I want this to be over.

12:28.391 --> 12:29.375
Fine.

12:30.695 --> 12:31.735
But I'm gonna be right there.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.757
What is going on? What is he doing?

12:57.571 --> 12:59.582
No, no, no. Y-You need to
stop this right now.

12:59.607 --> 13:01.577
- Hold. Everyone hold.
- No, he is not supposed to be alone.

13:16.394 --> 13:17.463
It's okay. Nothing's gonna happen.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.473
No, you don't know that!

13:18.474 --> 13:19.621
Hold on.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.393
- He's here.
- What?!

13:22.394 --> 13:24.354
He sees him.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
_

13:42.731 --> 13:44.307
Welcome to Candidate's Night.

13:44.332 --> 13:46.496
Come meet your candidates
for city council.

13:49.577 --> 13:51.496
Welcome to Candidate's Night.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.617
Come meet your candidates
for city council.

13:55.597 --> 13:57.274
Hey.

13:58.477 --> 14:00.242
Milo, what are you doing?

14:00.610 --> 14:01.570
Is this your dog?

14:01.571 --> 14:02.362
Mm-hmm.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.464
I got to start saying "no" though.

14:03.495 --> 14:05.518
He's always bothering people.

14:05.519 --> 14:08.119
He's not bothering me.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.605
You have a dog at home?

14:10.665 --> 14:13.813
My mom says they poop
and then sit on your couch.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.168
Your mom's right about that.

14:16.165 --> 14:18.058
But I want one.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.128
Someday.

14:23.048 --> 14:24.997
Hey, you want to give him a treat?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.067
I got some in my, uh, truck over there.

14:27.068 --> 14:29.018
Yeah?

14:32.642 --> 14:34.022
Ah, thanks.

14:38.632 --> 14:40.632
_

14:43.624 --> 14:45.593
- Something's wrong.
- He's not okay.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.144
- Stay here.
- He's not okay. I know my son.

14:47.169 --> 14:48.623
- Keep her here.
- We got this.

14:48.624 --> 14:50.968
Close the perimeter.
No one goes in or out.

14:57.724 --> 14:58.733
You all right?

15:01.009 --> 15:02.327
Uh, I think he's sick or something.

15:02.328 --> 15:03.382
I don't know. Something's
going on with him.

15:03.383 --> 15:04.773
- Did you see him?
- We're gonna need paramedics.

15:07.147 --> 15:08.704
What was he wearing?

15:14.255 --> 15:15.503
A blue jacket.

15:15.528 --> 15:19.095
White male, 30s, blue jacket,
brown hair, alone.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.710
Suspect has acne scars on his face.

15:21.735 --> 15:24.125
No one who fits that description
leaves this mall.

15:34.257 --> 15:36.276
What else? Hair still Brown?

15:36.277 --> 15:37.306
Longer, I think.

15:37.307 --> 15:39.198
Was he alone?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.409
I-I don't know.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.509
Think, Adam. Which way?

15:42.510 --> 15:45.320
I don't feel right. I...

15:48.370 --> 15:49.469
Buying out the whole store?

15:49.470 --> 15:52.369
Well, I don't know if I'm
dressing a girl or a boy, here.

15:52.370 --> 15:54.469
I got to cast a wide net.

16:02.450 --> 16:03.656
What's going on?

16:05.440 --> 16:07.469
I heard someone say "bomb threat."

16:07.470 --> 16:09.400
Oh, my God. Seriously?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.700
Maybe we should come back for these.

16:19.584 --> 16:20.623
Want to get some ice cream?

16:20.624 --> 16:22.623
Do I look like I'd say "no"?

16:44.952 --> 16:46.246
Willa, you in there?

16:50.418 --> 16:51.646
No.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.153
You pull an all-nighter?
Gary brought bagels.

16:55.568 --> 16:56.638
No!

16:56.755 --> 16:58.815
Your mom called. She said it's urgent.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.329
I'll call back.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.839
Scar tissue from
an old untreated infection,

17:37.840 --> 17:39.607
probably from his time in captivity.

17:39.772 --> 17:40.821
Is it serious?

17:40.822 --> 17:42.771
It caused an intestinal blockage,

17:42.772 --> 17:43.831
which we can correct.

17:43.832 --> 17:46.471
- It means surgery though.
- A routine procedure.

17:46.472 --> 17:48.565
Nothing about surgery
on your child is routine.

17:48.566 --> 17:50.151
I understand your concern,

17:50.152 --> 17:51.993
but your son's overall health is good

17:52.018 --> 17:53.812
and I'm confident he should be fine.

18:01.886 --> 18:03.855
Excuse me a minute.
Could I... talk to you?

18:03.856 --> 18:07.785
Uh, excuse me. I'm Claire Warren.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.244
Would you have a minute to hear
about my parking proposal?

18:09.245 --> 18:11.720
Ah, I'd love to,
but the boss needs me home.

18:11.721 --> 18:12.825
And by "boss" I mean girlfriend.

18:12.826 --> 18:13.975
Ah, well, good for her.

18:15.057 --> 18:17.926
Uh, let me just...
You can go on my website,

18:17.927 --> 18:19.875
and you can read everything there.

18:19.876 --> 18:20.995
Yeah, looking forward to it, Claire...

18:20.996 --> 18:22.905
Warren. Right. Right.

18:22.906 --> 18:24.357
You... You can read everything
there. Have a good night.

18:24.357 --> 18:25.865
- You, too.
- Thanks.

18:25.866 --> 18:27.835
Excuse me. Hi.

18:27.836 --> 18:30.995
... for just a
second about my parking proposal?

18:53.439 --> 18:54.618
So, you have him?

18:54.619 --> 18:56.478
- We just...
- The guy in custody.

18:56.479 --> 18:57.578
That's what you sold us.

18:57.579 --> 18:59.283
We detained a few people
matching the description.

18:59.284 --> 18:59.894
So, no?

18:59.919 --> 19:01.559
There's hours of security
footage to review,

19:01.560 --> 19:02.628
witnesses to talk to...

19:02.629 --> 19:04.056
I put my son through this whole thing...

19:04.057 --> 19:05.459
He was there.

19:10.619 --> 19:12.578
These people sometimes know
the family...

19:12.579 --> 19:14.581
be good if one of you could
come and look through footage,

19:14.606 --> 19:17.296
see if you recognize anyone...
even from years ago.

19:17.297 --> 19:19.180
I'll... I'll go. You stay with Adam.

19:20.895 --> 19:22.035
I'll return him.

19:22.559 --> 19:24.619
Mm. You always do.

19:52.694 --> 19:54.834
What do you do with the cupcakes
you don't sell?

19:54.835 --> 19:57.121
Uh, we donate them to a food bank.

19:59.845 --> 20:01.778
Do they pay for your work shirts?

20:01.864 --> 20:04.722
Uh, Hank Asher?

20:04.723 --> 20:06.239
Yes?

20:06.935 --> 20:08.804
Why don't you like
talking about yourself?

20:08.805 --> 20:09.954
Oh, I don't know.

20:09.955 --> 20:11.934
You... Well, you said
you used to be a CPA.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.024
Mm-hmm.

20:13.025 --> 20:14.955
Well, why'd you quit?

20:16.835 --> 20:18.338
I had issues.

20:24.734 --> 20:26.815
Do you want to watch
the director's commentary?

20:26.815 --> 20:29.864
- No, I...
- Sometimes that can be helpful.

20:35.035 --> 20:38.905
Is that okay?

21:13.606 --> 21:17.446
Oh!

21:28.971 --> 21:30.041
Stop.

21:35.965 --> 21:39.347
Please, stop.

21:41.278 --> 21:42.347
I said, "stop it!"

21:42.348 --> 21:43.348
W-Wh-What's wrong?

21:47.198 --> 21:48.317
I can't do that.

21:48.318 --> 21:50.387
Why not?

21:50.388 --> 21:52.257
Is it me?

21:52.258 --> 21:54.167
Are you... are you not attracted to me?

21:54.168 --> 21:55.006
No, it's not that.

21:55.007 --> 21:56.356
Well, then what is it?

21:59.328 --> 22:00.556
Google me.

22:03.083 --> 22:03.957
What?

22:07.619 --> 22:08.886
Google me.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.331
Really?

22:39.911 --> 22:42.183
Mom asked me
to pull you away from your desk.

22:42.208 --> 22:44.270
I didn't realize she meant literally.

22:47.079 --> 22:49.249
Please go away.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.070
You missed a lot of action today.

22:54.143 --> 22:55.366
What happened?

22:55.640 --> 23:00.620
Well, crawl out from under your
desk and maybe I'll tell you.

23:06.091 --> 23:07.581
I... I can't do it anymore.

23:09.111 --> 23:10.081
What?

23:13.274 --> 23:15.481
Hold everyone together.

23:17.426 --> 23:18.838
Who asked you to?

23:35.226 --> 23:37.255
Merry Christmas, happy birthday,
good Yontif.

23:37.256 --> 23:38.810
Got something for you.

23:38.811 --> 23:41.145
They found it in the trash can
on the second floor.

23:41.146 --> 23:42.165
Did they get anything from it?

23:42.166 --> 23:43.275
Not yet.

23:43.276 --> 23:46.145
Portable X-ray to Pediatrics.

23:46.146 --> 23:48.176
Portable X-ray to Pediatrics.

24:13.176 --> 24:16.136
_

24:19.918 --> 24:21.073
Sorry, sorry.

24:21.074 --> 24:22.661
Hey!

24:23.473 --> 24:25.246
Bunch of people wanted to
talk built-ins.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.522
Oh, a success?

24:26.523 --> 24:28.135
I'd say.

24:28.248 --> 24:29.591
What do you mean "he's gone?"

24:29.592 --> 24:31.582
I bought ice cream and I started talking

24:31.583 --> 24:34.201
to these girls from school,
and when I turned back...

24:34.201 --> 24:36.522
Okay. Well, he's... he's got
to be around here somewhere,

24:36.523 --> 24:37.894
- so, we'll just...
- Well, how long ago?

24:37.895 --> 24:40.523
- What?
- How long ago since you lost him?

24:41.667 --> 24:42.717
I don't know.

24:42.742 --> 24:46.328
I've... I've been looking
for him... maybe an hour?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.188
Should we get gauc?

24:52.391 --> 24:53.266
Do they make it at the table?

24:53.490 --> 24:54.600
Excuse me, have you seen a little boy?

24:54.625 --> 24:56.485
I'm gonna call 911, okay?

24:56.510 --> 24:58.640
- All right.
- Help me!

24:58.692 --> 25:00.542
- Excuse me. Have you seen a little boy?
- Have you seen a little boy, 8 years old?

25:00.567 --> 25:02.727
H-He's wearing a white T-shirt
that has my face on it.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.742
Adam! Have you seen a little boy?

25:04.767 --> 25:06.255
And he's got green eyes.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.330
Adam!

25:07.355 --> 25:08.465
Adam!

25:08.604 --> 25:10.444
- About this tall.
- Adam?!

25:10.469 --> 25:11.529
Have you seen Adam? Oh, God, Adam.

25:11.777 --> 25:12.370
Adam?

25:12.395 --> 25:15.305
Oh, God, Adam? Have you seen...

25:15.976 --> 25:16.996
He's got a white T-shirt

25:17.021 --> 25:18.825
with my picture on the front of it.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.840
- He's about 8 years old.
- Adam! Adam!

25:20.865 --> 25:21.925
Adam!

25:22.160 --> 25:24.280
- Oh, my God. Adam?
- Adam?

25:24.305 --> 25:26.115
Have you seen a little boy?

25:29.389 --> 25:31.880
- Adam?!
- Oh, my God. Adam?

25:32.438 --> 25:35.336
Why were you at Rockview Park
the night of September 2nd?

25:36.086 --> 25:37.523
I own a mini donut truck.

25:37.625 --> 25:39.076
I make my own jewelry.

25:39.076 --> 25:40.165
I run an animal rescue.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.782
I'm from the Parks Department.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.256
The PTA bought a booth.

25:43.256 --> 25:45.155
I was just with my friends.

25:45.156 --> 25:46.246
Did you see this boy?

25:46.979 --> 25:48.196
Not at my booth.

25:48.196 --> 25:49.798
That poor family.

25:50.571 --> 25:52.173
I saw that kid.

25:53.934 --> 25:56.236
I do, uh, custom cabinetry.

25:56.236 --> 25:58.215
And I had some birdhouses
out on display,

25:58.216 --> 25:59.807
and he stopped by for a minute
to look at them.

26:00.146 --> 26:01.165
Was he alone?

26:01.166 --> 26:03.521
No one seemed to be watching him.

26:03.723 --> 26:04.917
Were you alone?

26:05.552 --> 26:08.712
At the booth, and then I met
my girlfriend for dinner.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.607
And you were with your girlfriend

26:10.632 --> 26:11.318
the rest of the night?

26:11.343 --> 26:12.452
Yes, ma'am.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.865
You mind writing down her number?

26:20.552 --> 26:22.377
No. No, not at all.

26:28.433 --> 26:29.573
Anything else I can help you with?

26:32.317 --> 26:34.347
Thanks for coming down.

26:47.074 --> 26:48.802
People are boring, aren't they?

26:49.115 --> 26:51.085
Sheep with smartphones.

26:52.288 --> 26:54.903
There's no one I know in this mall.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.108
We got his jacket, John.

26:58.244 --> 26:59.724
Well, that's great. That's...

27:05.919 --> 27:07.098
I'm sorry.

27:08.130 --> 27:09.254
For what?

27:10.356 --> 27:11.855
Making things hard for you.

27:13.546 --> 27:15.395
Cases are hard.

27:15.396 --> 27:16.092
Nina...

27:16.093 --> 27:17.855
That's why it's called "work," right?

27:18.506 --> 27:19.556
Come on.

27:22.061 --> 27:23.221
Don't waste your time.

27:25.112 --> 27:26.162
Choose her.

27:27.536 --> 27:28.961
Choose your life.

27:32.827 --> 27:34.797
Single male. Blue jacket.

27:40.254 --> 27:43.184
He's been peed on, barfed on,

27:43.209 --> 27:44.951
flushed down the toilet twice...

27:45.411 --> 27:46.691
He's a survivor.

27:47.871 --> 27:48.994
Looks like it.

27:49.261 --> 27:51.291
You always needed him
when you were sick.

27:51.642 --> 27:52.854
Mom, I was 8.

27:54.111 --> 27:56.041
Oh, would you just mind, um,

27:56.066 --> 27:57.432
I think those are for someone else.

27:57.457 --> 27:59.055
It's the wrong name on the card.

28:02.159 --> 28:04.666
Okay. You're gonna be just fine.

28:04.666 --> 28:06.149
I know.

28:06.968 --> 28:08.198
I love you.

28:08.199 --> 28:10.119
I know.

28:13.069 --> 28:14.088
Hey, Mom.

28:14.089 --> 28:14.816
Yeah?

28:14.816 --> 28:16.403
I'm coming back.

28:25.918 --> 28:28.108
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

28:28.835 --> 28:30.988
I told a lie to fix a lie.

28:31.641 --> 28:33.516
Then you need to find the truth.

28:38.018 --> 28:39.516
I-I don't know where to look.

28:44.028 --> 28:45.374
Yes. See?

28:45.399 --> 28:47.068
That is how you cleanse your soul.

28:47.068 --> 28:48.068
I might puke.

28:48.069 --> 28:49.917
You're not gonna puke.

28:49.918 --> 28:51.097
I think it's physically
impossible to puke

28:51.098 --> 28:52.098
after one shot.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.180
Can we get two more?

28:54.888 --> 28:56.570
So, that's how you do it...

28:56.797 --> 28:58.148
you just take all your feelings,

28:58.173 --> 29:00.755
all your stupid, ugly, annoying...

29:01.068 --> 29:03.027
No. No. Those aren't my feelings.

29:03.028 --> 29:04.077
R-Right.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.007
You take y-your nice emotions,

29:06.008 --> 29:08.087
and then you just shove them down.

29:08.088 --> 29:10.937
You just stuff 'em, stuff 'em,
stuff 'em, like...

29:10.938 --> 29:12.701
like, uh, like, you know
how you pack a suitcase,

29:12.702 --> 29:14.685
how you roll everything up really tight,

29:14.710 --> 29:16.615
and then you put it exactly
where it's supposed to be,

29:16.640 --> 29:18.730
and then you sit on top of it
and then you do the zipper?

29:18.731 --> 29:20.808
- Yes.
- Yes. Exactly like that.

29:22.018 --> 29:22.856
And then what?

29:22.857 --> 29:24.882
And then you pour alcohol all over it.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.142
That can't possibly work.

29:27.143 --> 29:27.993
No, it does!

29:28.018 --> 29:31.044
It's basically been prov...
It... It's science.

29:31.081 --> 29:33.618
All right,
which has been around longer...

29:34.217 --> 29:36.740
booze or Jesus?

29:45.623 --> 29:46.672
Ah.

29:46.697 --> 29:47.716
Everything went great,

29:47.741 --> 29:49.630
he should be out of recovery very soon.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.754
Oh. Oh, good. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

29:51.779 --> 29:56.438
So, the, uh, the blockage was
here, right below his appendix.

29:56.463 --> 29:59.412
We resected two inches
of small intestine, and I...

29:59.437 --> 30:01.436
What, uh, w-what did you say?

30:01.461 --> 30:02.961
Uh, here's the transection.

30:03.221 --> 30:06.411
Uh, no. Uh, about the appendix?

30:06.448 --> 30:08.407
Uh, w-well, that's right here,

30:08.432 --> 30:10.581
but the bowel obstruction
was underneath, so...

30:10.606 --> 30:15.435
No, I-I'm sorry... could these
be someone else's scans?

30:15.512 --> 30:17.140
This is your son, Mrs. Warren.

30:17.296 --> 30:18.499
I just operated on him.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.280
No, but my son had his appendix
out when he was five.

30:23.296 --> 30:25.321
I'm pretty sure I didn't put it back in.

30:26.048 --> 30:28.636
Uh, you have three kids, right?

30:29.136 --> 30:29.922
Yes.

30:29.923 --> 30:30.915
Maybe you mixed them up.

30:31.311 --> 30:34.251
Most days I call my son the dog's name.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.473
That must be it.

30:37.586 --> 30:41.152
Uh, we'll want to observe him
for a few days, manage his pain.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.085
Adam?

32:03.629 --> 32:04.686
Adam?

32:14.348 --> 32:15.358
Ben?

32:23.642 --> 32:25.642
Hi, Mom.

32:40.037 --> 32:42.402
_

32:42.403 --> 32:44.323
Where is it?

32:56.443 --> 32:57.403
W-What are you doing?

32:57.404 --> 32:58.432
I can't find Monkey.

32:58.433 --> 33:00.761
What... what?

33:00.762 --> 33:02.183
The police must have...

33:02.184 --> 33:05.097
I don't know, when they came,
searched his room last night.

33:05.122 --> 33:06.303
What are... what are you saying?

33:06.303 --> 33:07.273
I can't his monkey!

33:07.274 --> 33:08.312
I can't find his monkey and I...

33:08.313 --> 33:09.432
And when he comes home
he's gonna need it,

33:09.433 --> 33:10.442
and I don't know where it is.

33:10.443 --> 33:11.838
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

33:11.839 --> 33:14.362
It'll be here somewhere, okay?

33:14.363 --> 33:15.681
- Yeah.
- Okay?

33:15.682 --> 33:18.382
Well, we'll find it. Okay?

33:18.383 --> 33:19.422
All right.

33:19.423 --> 33:20.642
Where is it?

33:21.413 --> 33:22.747
Where is it?

33:23.423 --> 33:25.231
Uh, where is it?

33:25.338 --> 33:28.213
_

34:22.987 --> 34:24.947
Any side effects you've noticed?

34:24.947 --> 34:26.107
I get hot. I sweat more.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.078
Hot flashes.

34:27.079 --> 34:28.927
That's the hormones.

34:28.928 --> 34:29.987
Any other effects?

34:29.987 --> 34:31.917
Uh, the rest I welcome.

34:31.918 --> 34:32.976
So no more urges?

34:34.058 --> 34:35.067
Not since I started.

34:35.068 --> 34:36.386
And that was?

34:37.047 --> 34:38.107
10 years ago.

34:38.108 --> 34:39.917
I was incarcerated.

34:39.918 --> 34:41.007
There was a study.

34:41.007 --> 34:42.985
You could volunteer.

34:49.127 --> 34:51.529
You understand you're not
required by law to do this?

34:54.607 --> 34:56.686
I'd rather be an eunuch than a monster.

34:57.148 --> 34:58.534
Every three months, then.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.042
I know the drill.

35:05.605 --> 35:06.824
I have another couple hours.

35:06.825 --> 35:09.704
I-I'll be there as soon as I can.

35:09.705 --> 35:12.506
Well, if you're tenderizing it,
it won't dry out.

35:12.735 --> 35:15.655
Just keep it warm. I'm gonna love it.

35:19.393 --> 35:20.552
Miss you, too.

35:22.775 --> 35:24.734
I ought to put a bell on you, kid.

35:24.735 --> 35:26.684
Our friend has a dog.

35:26.685 --> 35:27.744
What?

35:27.745 --> 35:29.234
They're still analyzing the fibers

35:29.235 --> 35:30.353
but it's definitely dog hair.

35:31.359 --> 35:32.851
Well, that's not nothing.

35:33.695 --> 35:35.036
Hey, stop that.

35:36.832 --> 35:37.824
What is it?

35:39.224 --> 35:40.895
That woman... rewind.

35:47.107 --> 35:48.146
That's Jane.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.551
Who's Jane?

35:50.171 --> 35:52.130
The one from the oil refinery that knew

35:52.131 --> 35:53.229
all about the bunkers.

36:22.242 --> 36:25.331
You tell anyone
about the paternity test?

36:25.332 --> 36:26.740
No.

36:29.372 --> 36:30.422
Are you going to?

36:33.292 --> 36:34.371
You want me to make you feel better

36:34.372 --> 36:36.312
or do you want me to be honest?

36:40.352 --> 36:42.040
Make me feel better.

36:44.645 --> 36:46.764
I haven't decided yet.

36:47.422 --> 36:48.540
Well...

36:54.255 --> 36:56.335
I haven't decided yet, either.

36:58.118 --> 36:59.308
Decided what?

37:03.955 --> 37:05.094
Exactly.

37:05.095 --> 37:07.104
You're drunk.

37:07.105 --> 37:11.095
Just... seems like that
because I've been drinking.

37:13.115 --> 37:15.155
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:18.797 --> 37:20.490
Why are you here?

37:43.152 --> 37:45.321
I don't know how to do this.

37:45.322 --> 37:48.341
Just... follow along.

38:02.797 --> 38:04.726
Dinner is served.

38:04.727 --> 38:06.719
And by "dinner" I mean, Jell-O.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.805
These are yours now, honey.

38:08.806 --> 38:10.136
There's no "Ben" here on the ward.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.260
Thank you.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.591
Loneliness is a dangerous thing.

39:06.472 --> 39:09.930
It can turn you into someone
you don't even recognize.

39:10.123 --> 39:11.539
Who is he?

39:16.423 --> 39:17.423
I... I don't know what you...

39:24.005 --> 39:25.867
Is his name Ben?

39:40.414 --> 39:42.483
I'm so sorry, mom.

39:42.508 --> 39:44.207
I'm s-sorry.

39:44.562 --> 39:45.817
Oh, God.

39:56.739 --> 39:58.649
What did you do?

40:01.945 --> 40:03.918
Man into monster.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.067
_

40:47.966 --> 40:49.926
Who's that?

40:55.613 --> 40:57.143
A friend.

41:01.898 --> 41:04.208
Lucky for me...

41:17.820 --> 41:19.060
...I was never alone.
