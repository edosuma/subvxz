00:07.007 --> 00:11.929
My grandfather made the first
Alo using just what he had:

00:11.971 --> 00:17.017
a soup can, a skate key
and a broken clock.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.896
When Alo became popular,

00:20.938 --> 00:23.441
everything changed for our family.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.467
We were no longer poor.

00:27.111 --> 00:30.906
It was my father who started
shipping Alo internationally.

00:30.948 --> 00:34.368
Wasn't long after that, he was
approached by a friend who had,

00:34.410 --> 00:36.579
well, some ties to the cartel,

00:36.620 --> 00:39.415
and they offered to conceal
their product in ours

00:39.457 --> 00:42.001
for a very generous price.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.464
Of course, it wasn't really
an offer, and saying "no,"

00:46.505 --> 00:50.092
well, that's never an option.

00:52.470 --> 00:56.248
And that is how the family
business expanded.

00:58.125 --> 01:02.104
Well, at least it added a few
zeroes to your bank account.

01:02.146 --> 01:05.775
And even more zeroes when
my father eliminated the men

01:05.816 --> 01:07.568
who tried to push themselves
into our business,

01:07.610 --> 01:08.903
then took over, himself.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.738
You see, my father, God bless him,

01:10.780 --> 01:13.073
he... oh, he had no tolerance

01:13.115 --> 01:15.326
for people who tried to push him around.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.577
Well, sounds like he hated bullies,

01:16.619 --> 01:19.121
and I hate them, too. So...

01:19.163 --> 01:21.040
You know, it wa-it wasn't
just about the money.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.709
We had the ability to provide
for the community.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.337
You know? To sustain
a livelihood for the town.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.380
Well, that's important.
You like to give back. I...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.132
I really like to do the same.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.052
I think we're... we might be
cut from the same cloth.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.678
Almost. Almost...

01:34.720 --> 01:36.722
But, well, obviously, the...

01:36.764 --> 01:39.308
Los Angeles is a bit bigger
than Rosarito, but you know.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.352
MÃ¡s o menos.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.104
Well, now we have the
opportunity to help each other.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.856
Yes. Uh, it's my understanding

01:45.898 --> 01:48.859
that you have an extremely
generous return on investment.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.486
I could use that.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.363
I'm trying to build
some big, shiny buildings.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.574
Well, and it is my understanding
you have the liquefiable assets

01:55.616 --> 01:56.784
to convert into quick cash,

01:56.826 --> 01:58.786
and, well,

01:58.828 --> 02:00.412
I need cash in hand.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.122
Well, then, I think we should do this.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.541
I don't know if we shake hands,

02:03.582 --> 02:05.501
or if there's champagne that we can...

02:05.543 --> 02:07.545
She's ready.

02:09.404 --> 02:11.799
Well, before we make this official,

02:11.841 --> 02:14.593
I would like to show you
something, Mr. Tom.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.303
Please, follow me.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.680
Yeah.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.723
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.253
After you, Tom. Please.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.606
Come in.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.363
You know, I never wanted to take
over the family business.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.137
I studied to be a surgeon,
but you know...

02:36.179 --> 02:37.524
Are you-are you sure you want me in here?

02:37.565 --> 02:39.243
Tom. Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
Please, don't.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.620
Don't you ever interrupt me again.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.997
I hate to be interrupted.

02:50.862 --> 02:54.341
You know, I promised my father
on his deathbed

02:54.383 --> 02:56.743
I was gonna take over the business,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.181
and I always keep my promises.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.231
Please.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.275
Come in.

03:15.674 --> 03:19.074
Are you familiar with the
concept of contrapasso? Hmm?

03:21.023 --> 03:22.411
- No.
- No?

03:22.453 --> 03:23.829
It's Dante.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.625
In short, let the punishment fit
the crime.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.085
Now, I'm a generous person, Tom,

03:30.127 --> 03:33.339
but I don't like
to be taken advantage of.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.382
She took advantage.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.509
When I ask her about it,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
she ran from me.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.515
Well, that ends today.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.317
Oh, shit...

03:53.359 --> 03:57.404
You can go now, if you want.

H.R. Pufnstuf,

07:11.140 --> 07:14.184
who's your friend when things get rough?

07:27.489 --> 07:28.657
Don't worry.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.033
You'll get the hang of it.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

09:30.779 --> 09:32.447
This is the gun
that Detective Roman found

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
at the scene of the crime.

09:35.023 --> 09:36.076
Patty?

09:36.118 --> 09:38.287
And this is the gun
from the security footage.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.330
Now, you see that flash of chrome?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.957
- That's not the same gun.
- That's just the way

09:41.999 --> 09:43.709
the light is hitting the metal.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.168
You just entered two contradictory pieces

09:45.210 --> 09:46.795
of evidence into trial, bud.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.630
No, look, zoomed in like that,

09:48.672 --> 09:50.399
the footage is too grainy
to be conclusive.

09:50.441 --> 09:52.801
Now, I'm sure that I can find
an expert witness to testify

09:52.843 --> 09:54.594
that that is, in fact, the same gun.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.346
Let me save you the trouble.

10:05.682 --> 10:07.253
That's the gun in the video.

10:07.295 --> 10:08.692
Where the hell did that come from?

10:09.735 --> 10:11.403
Mr. McBride?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.739
This gun belonged to Pedro Suarez.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.324
That's Julio's older brother.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.784
Julio had it with him
the night of the murders.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.188
It's been with his girlfriend ever since.

10:19.229 --> 10:21.580
Oh, yeah? And whose word are
we supposed to take for that? Yours?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.174
There's no telling where this
gun has been since the shooting.

10:24.215 --> 10:26.087
There's no telling who's been
tampering with this gun

10:26.129 --> 10:27.294
since the shooting, or if that

10:27.336 --> 10:28.920
is even the same gun that's in the video.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.814
The girlfriend is
prepared to testify to its chain

10:30.856 --> 10:32.674
- of custody.
- Oh, well, good, then, I want

10:32.716 --> 10:34.926
a warrant for her arrest. She's
an accessory after the fact.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.111
She's not an accessory
after anything. She's 15,

10:37.152 --> 10:39.139
and that gun was never used in any crime.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.807
And you're willing to bet
her life on that?

10:40.849 --> 10:41.892
Yes.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.393
Go ahead and have it tested.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.895
When it comes back clean,

10:44.936 --> 10:46.563
we'll move to suppress the video.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.066
Your Honor, the jury can't see Julio

10:49.107 --> 10:51.068
in that video with that gun.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.666
- It's bad character evidence.
- Okay, look.

10:52.707 --> 10:55.284
Gun or no gun, this footage clearly shows

10:55.326 --> 10:56.811
that Julio was there around

10:56.853 --> 10:58.825
- the time of the murders.
- We'll stipulate to that.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.369
Hell, and just because
we can only see one gun

11:00.410 --> 11:01.870
in the video, it doesn't mean

11:01.912 --> 11:03.121
that he didn't have another one on him.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.290
What are you talking about?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.625
Well, it seems like we're in a little bit

11:06.666 --> 11:08.335
of an evidentiary quagmire here,

11:08.377 --> 11:11.546
but I've heard enough to warrant
a suppression hearing,

11:11.588 --> 11:12.798
so we'll schedule it.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.848
By the way, Mr. McBride, nice suit.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.642
Oh. Yeah.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.396
I, uh, I was at Costco,
and I didn't want to be late.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.356
You know, just...
it's kind of across town,

11:29.398 --> 11:32.067
so... so, yeah.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.610
So I definitely had

11:33.652 --> 11:35.237
better things to do last night.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.947
Uh-huh.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.032
- But I googled you.
- You did?

11:39.074 --> 11:40.283
- Yeah.
- I'm flattered.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.547
- Mm-hmm.
- What did you find?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.578
Oh, nothing impressive.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.624
Um, just that you built
half of downtown L.A.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.251
- Only half?
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.587
You have a seat on every fucking
board of everything.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.631
- Not true.
- And...

11:54.673 --> 11:56.550
...you're allergic to wool.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.218
That's actually true.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.095
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really embarrassing.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.388
- Why is that on there?
- Oh, it limits my...

12:01.430 --> 12:02.824
it limits my wardrobe options.

12:02.865 --> 12:03.932
I don't know. I don't...

12:03.974 --> 12:05.267
Uh-huh. So you just wear, like,

12:05.308 --> 12:07.853
scuba sweat suits every day, or...?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.229
You're making fun of my clothes?

12:09.271 --> 12:10.981
Did you just work out?
I don't understand.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.899
I thought I looked cool.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.985
You look cool. I didn't say you
didn't look cool, it's just...

12:15.026 --> 12:16.069
All right. Cool. Thanks.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.320
- Very athletic.
- Mm-kay.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.655
- Cool, I'll take that.
- Yeah.

12:18.697 --> 12:19.865
All right.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.533
My turn. Um...

12:21.575 --> 12:23.702
I didn't google you.
I Yahoo searched you.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.953
Um...

12:24.995 --> 12:26.037
And I didn't find very much.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.456
You're very mysterious.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.332
Well, Yahoo isn't really
the good search engine.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.001
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Maybe that's what it was.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.336
- Um...
- Or maybe, you're kind of secretive?

12:33.378 --> 12:34.838
I-It's not secretive. I just...

12:34.880 --> 12:37.132
I don't know. I... I prefer it that way.

12:37.174 --> 12:40.802
Fair enough. Um, start easy.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.013
Do you... you work?

12:43.566 --> 12:45.704
I do work. Yeah.

12:45.745 --> 12:47.134
Are you going to make me ask what you do?

12:47.175 --> 12:48.375
'Cause that was...

12:48.400 --> 12:50.421
I was trying to imply I'd be
interested in knowing that.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.939
Um, I work, uh... I work for a lawyer.

12:53.798 --> 12:55.108
- A lawyer?
- And I mean, I-I...

12:55.150 --> 12:58.028
I do... yeah, I do, like, um,
like, paralegal stuff.

12:58.069 --> 13:02.073
So how'd you end up
with this lawyer situation?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.075
- Okay. Uh, Billy?
- Mm-hmm.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.660
Uh, he's my boss, the lawyer.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.662
- His name's Billy?
- Yeah. Billy McBride.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.957
I don't know if you've heard it.
Anyway, um, he, uh...

13:10.999 --> 13:12.751
he kind of got me out of a jam.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.545
I-I got picked up on a little drug thing,

13:15.587 --> 13:18.465
and needed a job,

13:18.507 --> 13:20.592
and he hired me.

13:21.408 --> 13:23.136
That's great. He sounds like a great guy.

13:23.661 --> 13:25.472
- Actually, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.890
Cool. You have any, uh, interesting cases

13:26.932 --> 13:28.767
or anything you're working on?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.811
Um, uh, yeah, actually,

13:31.853 --> 13:34.397
there's this kid who just got
arrested for a double hom...

13:34.439 --> 13:36.024
Excuse me, um, I'm sorry.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.693
Are you Rachel's friend
from Cedars-Sinai?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.950
Um... N-No. No.

13:40.992 --> 13:43.031
I know I know you. It's driving
me crazy. I'm sorry.

13:45.369 --> 13:46.470
Um, Vegas?

13:47.852 --> 13:49.079
No. No, I don't...

13:49.120 --> 13:50.580
I don't... I don't go to Vegas.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.273
- Um...
- Right.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.918
- Um, uh, my mistake.
- Yeah.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.549
That was weird.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.803
Okay, fine. You're probably
gonna hear about this

14:04.844 --> 14:08.139
- in a meeting sooner or later, so, um...
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.894
Okay, until a couple months ago,
I was kind of an escort.

14:13.836 --> 14:16.481
I just really needed the money.

14:18.216 --> 14:19.776
And anyway, I'm behind all that.

14:19.818 --> 14:24.597
It's past me now, so, yeah,
that's my darkest secret.

14:26.376 --> 14:27.644
What's yours?

14:27.684 --> 14:30.120
First off, I'm gonna tell you
something very important.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.457
You're way too ugly to be an escort.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.503
That's what you're ashamed of?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.221
Don't be ashamed of that.

14:40.263 --> 14:42.048
Our imperfections make us beautiful.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.758
Come on.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.845
My closet's got way worse
skeletons than that.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.557
If you take me out to dinner,
I might even tell you.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.850
- Yeah?
- Actually, you know what?

14:51.891 --> 14:52.934
I'll take you out to dinner.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.060
I'll pay, 'cause I'm...

14:54.102 --> 14:55.562
You know, I built half of downtown,

14:55.604 --> 14:58.023
- so I'm really...
- Right. Right. You're really...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.691
- I'm rich as shit, okay?
- You're really rich.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.277
- Let's just call it.
- Right. Right, right.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.404
Did you build this place?

15:04.446 --> 15:05.780
With my bare fucking hands.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.451
Oh yeah? Okay. Uh-huh.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.859
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.546
We got a suppression hearing
scheduled, so...

15:21.588 --> 15:23.965
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Yup.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.759
You got a package.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.636
- Who's it from?
- I don't know.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.013
- There's no return address.
- Huh.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.515
Uh, I tried the insurance company

15:32.557 --> 15:33.976
- a couple of times, uh...
- Yeah?

15:34.017 --> 15:35.810
...but I couldn't get through.

15:36.637 --> 15:37.721
They do know that

15:37.763 --> 15:38.938
I'm trying to pay a bill, right?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.357
Right? You'd think they'd be thrilled

15:40.398 --> 15:41.775
to take your money, but ugh.

15:41.816 --> 15:42.942
Is this the bunion thing?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.402
No, it's the hip thing.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.321
Oh, Irene threw her hip out?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.740
No, Gor has the hip thing,
but it's fine now.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.409
Oh, I can't keep them all straight.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.120
Yeah, well, neither can
the insurance company, so...

16:05.239 --> 16:08.259
What? You get candy from an admirer?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.431
- It's okay, ma'am.
- Uh-uh, sir. Excuse me, sir?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.601
I got a special delivery
for Detective Roman.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.022
Fellas.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.899
- What's up, Roman?
- Who's that?

16:22.941 --> 16:25.538
Got something for you
to book into evidence here.

16:25.579 --> 16:26.993
Yeah? What is it?

16:27.035 --> 16:29.138
Also, I'll see you
at the suppression hearing.

16:33.017 --> 16:35.328
- Yeah.
- What the fuck?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.580
We tried to tell you
he was the fucking shooter,

16:37.622 --> 16:38.957
but you wouldn't do shit about it,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.375
- so you're in trouble now, buddy.
- Are you fucking...

16:40.417 --> 16:41.543
- I'm in trouble?
- Yeah, you're in trouble.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.585
I'm in trouble? You bring this shit...

16:42.627 --> 16:44.045
- I would think so, yeah.
- You threatening me?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.588
Well, I don't know if
it's a threat or not, but...

16:45.630 --> 16:46.965
You come in here
and you fucking bring this shit

16:47.006 --> 16:48.633
and you threaten me? You out of
your fucking mind? Turn around.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.009
- Why would I turn around?
- Turn the fuck around.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.052
- Why would I turn around?
- You fucking asshole.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.596
Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.806
- Roman, you all right?
- Yeah. I'm good, man. I'm good.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.141
This is never gonna stick, dude.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.268
If you'd have done your goddamn job...

16:58.309 --> 16:59.769
Huh, McBride? You think
it's a fucking joke?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.229
Yeah. I'm gonna call the Feds
on you guys...

17:01.271 --> 17:02.772
You think this is a fucking...

17:02.814 --> 17:03.857
...investigate your whole
fucking department.

17:03.898 --> 17:04.898
You're an asshole.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.984
- Keep walking, Billy.
- Okay.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.069
- Just keep walking, asshole.
- Yeah, you're so full of shit.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.861
- Keep walking, motherfucker.
- Uh-huh.

17:10.902 --> 17:13.992
So, the government knows
that I know who killed Kennedy

17:14.032 --> 17:16.368
and why they killed him,
how they killed him

17:16.411 --> 17:18.184
- and how they covered it up.
- Right.

17:18.226 --> 17:22.000
They created the Assassination
Reports Collection Act.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.710
- Mm-hmm.
- That means that they've got to release

17:23.752 --> 17:26.628
all these documents,
3,000 of them, to the...

17:26.671 --> 17:28.298
They've been hiding, covering up...

17:28.339 --> 17:29.966
- Uh-huh. I hear you.
- Know what they did with the car?

17:30.008 --> 17:30.967
They didn't...

17:31.009 --> 17:33.303
- They didn't do a...
- How you doing?

17:33.344 --> 17:36.556
- Hey. I'm all right.
- You have hair just like my ex-wife.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.689
- Yeah?
- I could never

17:37.714 --> 17:39.318
run my fingers through it.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.478
- Yes, it's a challenge.
- It's real pretty,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.104
but too sticky.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.719
Use hair spray?

17:44.761 --> 17:48.298
- Uh, no. I use glue. Yep.
- Ah. Yeah.

17:48.339 --> 17:51.029
- Jeff.
- You should've called me about Tito

17:51.070 --> 17:52.864
before you got yourself arrested.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.658
Well, I didn't exactly plan
on getting arrested, so...

17:55.700 --> 17:57.994
Yeah, nobody ever does, but, you know,

17:58.036 --> 17:59.579
the shit rolls downhill, sometimes.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.446
You gonna take Tito with you or what?

18:01.488 --> 18:02.488
No, I'll have

18:02.513 --> 18:03.833
- one of my guys pick him up.
- Great.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.711
Don't trust those bastards.
They're in your bank accounts.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.338
Never do anything online.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.923
They can't rob you blind
if you ain't blind.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.383
That's it, Jim. You got it, buddy.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.553
It's good talking to you, man.
I'll catch you next time.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.096
- At the Chez Jay.
- Yeah.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.098
- I'll scout you out, Billy.
- You got it, man.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.500
Good talking to you.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.145
Hey, Patty.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.939
- Hold on a sec.
- What?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.982
You look nice.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.901
- You hungry?
- No.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.153
- You want to grab a drink?
- No.

18:32.195 --> 18:35.573
Okay, well, look,
if you change your mind...

18:35.615 --> 18:37.826
- I don't want that.
- Oh!

18:37.867 --> 18:41.246
Go on, take the card.
He seems like a nice guy.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.789
Thanks.

18:48.545 --> 18:53.508
I think that whoever sent that
fucking head knows who you are,

18:54.450 --> 18:56.410
knows where you live...

18:57.887 --> 19:00.265
probably knows everyone you know,

19:00.306 --> 19:03.017
including me and Denise and,

19:03.543 --> 19:05.586
man, if you don't stop...

19:08.422 --> 19:10.149
I mean, something's gonna happen.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.310
If you want to get out,
I completely understand.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.038
I didn't say that I was quitting.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.333
I'm just worried and I needed
to say it out loud. Okay?

19:28.276 --> 19:29.485
Okay.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.256
I heard you.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.447
Okay.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.196
Mmm. Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.989
What'd you marinate it in,
like, a lemon something?

20:40.031 --> 20:42.575
Take some home.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.078
I mean, Keith ate nothing, as usual.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.454
It's just work stress.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.831
- I'm sure he's just fine.
- Mm-hmm.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.875
Where do you keep your, um, your Ziplocs?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.962
Mm. In there.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.005
Look, it's what Keith does.

20:56.047 --> 21:00.218
He gets all worked up
over something and...

21:00.259 --> 21:02.178
then it just goes away.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.471
You sure I can take all this?

21:03.513 --> 21:05.723
You know, he used to talk to me.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.895
You know, like, a-a little
at least, and now I...

21:13.272 --> 21:17.777
Like, I don't know if
he's, uh, having an affair.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mary.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.447
Mary. Mary. Stop. Stop.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.908
Look, I never thought I'd be
one of those women, okay?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.535
But I was talking to Rachel Sherman.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.078
You remember Rachel?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.496
- No, I don't. I don't.
- Yes, you do.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.164
She graduated the year before all of us.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.791
- Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.418
Her husband was acting really weird.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.169
She hired a PI and found out

21:35.211 --> 21:37.255
he had a whole other family
in Huntington Beach.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.090
- Oh. Okay, okay.
- So...

21:39.132 --> 21:41.259
Hang on. Hang on a second.
You come here. Come here.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.719
- What?
- Come here. You... Come here.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.305
- You are... you are talking crazy.
- Am I?

21:46.347 --> 21:47.296
I would know.

21:47.321 --> 21:49.225
I know you would know,
but would you tell me?

21:49.267 --> 21:51.519
- Wh...?
- There's like guy code or whatever.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.062
- Listen to me.
- So...

21:53.104 --> 21:56.149
Do not waste your money
on a private investigator.

21:56.969 --> 21:58.276
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.820
- Okay.
- I'm just... I'm, like, this close.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.531
Okay. That's just...
...just keep it that close.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.283
Just don't-don't-don't do it. Okay?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.701
- It's okay.
- Yeah, I'm just...

22:06.743 --> 22:10.276
- All right. All right. Okay.
- Mom!

22:24.010 --> 22:26.012
I think you missed a spot.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.562
I saw his head in a fucking box.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.466
I know. I know.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.569
Dude, y-y-you're scaring
the shit out of Mary.

22:41.611 --> 22:45.198
I mean, she thinks you got a
secret fucking family somewhere.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.825
She-she's talking about hiring a PI.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.368
That could be really fucking bad
for us, dude.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.038
- Really fucking bad.
- For us?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.211
You don't give a fuck
about what happens to me.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.754
Hmm?

23:00.279 --> 23:01.839
You fucked up my life.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.299
- I fucked up your...
- You fucked up my life.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.093
Dude. Dude, you-you know what?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.552
You got to keep your shit together.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.137
- Oh, yeah?
- That's the fucking bottom line.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.639
- Keep your shit together.
- Or-or what?

23:09.680 --> 23:12.308
If you don't, at a certain point,

23:12.350 --> 23:13.768
it's gonna be out of my hands, man.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.270
What are you saying to me?

23:16.312 --> 23:17.772
Oh, come on, dude. I'm just...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.232
- I'm just saying, there's...
- Fuck you.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.733
Okay, yeah. It's my fault. Fuck me.

23:20.775 --> 23:21.943
That's fucking great.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.821
Fuck! What the fuck, man?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.370
- What the fuck?
- Fuck. Get off me.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.039
- Get off of me.
- Calm the fuck down.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.250
Calm the fuck down.

23:39.262 --> 23:40.820
Fuck.

23:42.196 --> 23:43.589
Dude, hey, it's okay.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.467
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

23:47.117 --> 23:50.041
It's okay. It's okay.

23:50.066 --> 23:51.514
Look at me. Look at me.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.765
- Breathe.
- What did we fucking do, man?

23:52.807 --> 23:54.308
- What did we fucking do?
- Look at me.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.477
Look at me. You are gonna
be great tomorrow.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.104
- No.
- You are gonna be great.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.811
- I don't think so.
- Listen. Listen.

23:59.852 --> 24:03.776
Just remember this:
Billy McBride cannot prove shit.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.611
I don't know, man.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.988
No, no, no. I know.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.114
We're gonna get through this together.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.115
I'm getting you more money.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.812
Okay?

24:10.854 --> 24:12.977
Hey, do you trust me?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.851
Patrolling the perimeter,
I noticed a section of the fence

24:36.893 --> 24:39.770
behind a couple of garbage bins
was slightly askew.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.857
I searched there and that's
where I found the handgun.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.525
- This handgun?
- Correct.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.194
Did you send this
to forensics for testing?

24:46.235 --> 24:49.655
Yes. I-It had been wiped clean
of fingerprints,

24:49.697 --> 24:52.575
but ballistics confirmed
that it was the gun used

24:52.617 --> 24:54.785
to kill Marcos PeÃ±a and Hunter Friedman.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.729
Thank you, Detective.

24:58.289 --> 25:02.126
There you go.
I'll take that, bud. Thanks.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.170
This is the gun you found
at Julio's apartment?

25:04.212 --> 25:06.906
- That's what I just said.
- Yeah, okay.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.592
Did you find this one,

25:09.634 --> 25:11.260
the one that we know he had
on him that night?

25:11.302 --> 25:13.679
- No.
- No? Okay.

25:14.397 --> 25:17.475
So, Detective Roman,
you went back two weeks later

25:17.516 --> 25:19.352
and conducted a search
of Julio's apartment

25:19.393 --> 25:20.853
after having already conducted

25:20.895 --> 25:22.250
a thorough search of the apartment?

25:22.292 --> 25:23.856
Based on an anonymous tip.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.358
Yes, Your Honor. Based on that tip,

25:25.399 --> 25:27.526
I requested that
Detective Roman go back out

25:27.568 --> 25:29.499
and perform a second search for that gun

25:29.541 --> 25:30.947
in all the common areas
near the apartment.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.698
I-I didn't ask you, Mr. Rashad.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.117
Detective Roman,

25:35.893 --> 25:38.496
you searched Julio's apartment
the first time

25:38.537 --> 25:40.748
right after the murders with a K-9 unit

25:40.790 --> 25:42.551
and yet, no weapon was found,
is that right?

25:42.593 --> 25:44.377
Well, we didn't search the outside, okay?

25:44.418 --> 25:46.170
The original warrant didn't cover that.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.297
Was the dog aware that
the warrant didn't cover it?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.716
Did you tell him to turn off
his sense of smell that day?

25:50.758 --> 25:52.677
Your Honor, objection.
I'm sorry. Is this a joke?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.370
Mr. McBride, that's enough.

25:55.179 --> 25:59.053
So, how can a trained gun-sniffing dog

25:59.095 --> 26:02.186
fail to notice a weapon five
feet away from the apartment?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.398
Believe it or not,
I'm not an expert on canines.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.983
Your Honor, at some point, I hope we get

26:07.024 --> 26:08.818
some type of legitimate question
from Mr. McBride.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.095
Okay, here's a question.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.656
Was the gun found in a location

26:13.698 --> 26:15.366
that was under Julio's exclusive control?

26:16.043 --> 26:17.037
No.

26:17.062 --> 26:18.411
Was it the same weapon
that Julio had on him

26:18.452 --> 26:19.954
in the security video that night?

26:19.996 --> 26:21.956
- No.
- Were there any fingerprints

26:21.998 --> 26:24.292
- to connect Julio to the gun?
- No.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.168
So, you're telling me
the gun was there for two weeks,

26:26.210 --> 26:29.380
and during that time, there was
an exhaustive police search

26:29.422 --> 26:31.132
with people coming and going everywhere

26:31.173 --> 26:32.758
and yet, you're the only one
who found the weapon.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.386
Well, look, I... I've explained
that it was hidden

26:35.428 --> 26:37.096
behind the garbage bins, all right?

26:37.138 --> 26:39.473
Mm-hmm. Okay, so it's
your position that Julio

26:39.515 --> 26:42.476
was so shrewd that he discarded

26:42.518 --> 26:44.520
the non-murder weapon
with his girlfriend,

26:44.562 --> 26:46.772
wiped his fingerprints
off the murder weapon,

26:46.814 --> 26:49.150
and yet he was so careless
that he tossed it

26:49.191 --> 26:50.609
five feet from his apartment.

26:51.051 --> 26:52.403
Is that your contention?

26:53.053 --> 26:54.498
I... I don't know what tell you, Counsel.

26:54.540 --> 26:55.906
So, the gun was in a fence

26:55.948 --> 26:57.533
open to the world. Anybody
could've put it there.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.160
No. I don't... I don't think it...

26:59.201 --> 27:00.953
Hell, I mean, you could've even
planted it there, Detective.

27:00.995 --> 27:03.372
Objection, Your Honor. Detective Roman

27:03.414 --> 27:05.416
is a distinguished veteran
of our police force

27:05.458 --> 27:07.418
with an impeccable record.
He's slandering him.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.128
Okay. There's no physical evidence

27:09.170 --> 27:10.963
tying Julio to this murder weapon,

27:11.005 --> 27:13.049
leaving it with no probative value.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.468
The prejudicial effect is immense.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.906
- You have to suppress it.
- Suppress...

27:17.947 --> 27:20.181
Your Honor, we are... we're not
talking about a weapon. Okay?

27:20.222 --> 27:22.933
We are talking about the murder weapon,

27:22.975 --> 27:26.604
which was found five feet
from the defendant's residence.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.981
We'll let the jury decide its
probative value, thank you.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.484
Hmm. I-I thought that was
the court's job.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.611
Yes, it is.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.346
I decide what the jury sees, Mr. Rashad.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.449
So if there's nothing further?

27:39.475 --> 27:41.952
Okay. My clerk will notify you
of my decision.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.288
Court's adjourned.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.039
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:45.981 --> 27:47.375
Is what happened good?

27:47.416 --> 27:49.126
Well, we won't know
till we hear from the judge,

27:49.168 --> 27:50.336
but it looks pretty good, yeah.

27:50.378 --> 27:51.879
So when will we know?

27:51.921 --> 27:53.464
A day or two, probably.

27:53.947 --> 27:55.949
I keep forgetting to thank you.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.177
Both of you.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.388
Well, thank us once
we get you out of here, okay?

28:00.429 --> 28:01.639
Hey, you'll be all right.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.040
Gonna be all right.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.752
Yeah.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.738
No. No.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.456
Oh, fuck!

28:27.498 --> 28:28.999
Oh!

28:29.041 --> 28:31.043
Oh, sh...

28:35.423 --> 28:37.216
Do I have your attention?

28:37.258 --> 28:39.552
What the f...
What did I do? What the fuck?!

28:39.593 --> 28:41.929
Miguel is outside. He will drive you.

28:42.570 --> 28:43.988
Ah...

28:56.735 --> 28:58.612
- Any trouble at the border?
- No.

28:58.654 --> 29:01.323
But this one's pissing his pants.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.994
Get him a diaper for the way home.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.040
- Welcome, Tom. Please, sit down.
- I-I'm sorry, Gabriel,

29:10.082 --> 29:11.249
do you mind if I ask what I'm doing here?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.391
I'm not really sure I can...

29:13.433 --> 29:14.837
uh, you know.

29:14.897 --> 29:16.630
This I'm gonna tell you. Please,

29:17.339 --> 29:19.008
have a seat.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.249
You know, I don't like to make a habit...

29:27.933 --> 29:29.268
...of repeating myself, but I guess

29:29.310 --> 29:30.978
you didn't hear me the first time.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.605
- I...
- Ah, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

29:32.646 --> 29:33.981
- Good.
- I'm sorry.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.775
Now, Marisol Silva's still a problem.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.944
I have it in good authority

29:38.986 --> 29:40.946
that the case is going good, which means

29:40.988 --> 29:43.657
the Suarez kid can be acquitted.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.893
And if he is acquitted, Tom,

29:46.327 --> 29:47.912
that would only bring more questions.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.498
And we don't want more
questions, do we, Tom?

29:55.044 --> 29:57.946
Uh, no, no. Um...

29:58.589 --> 30:00.382
It's funny, you seem to know
more about this case than I do.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.468
Well, that's a problem, isn't it?

30:02.510 --> 30:04.094
Well, then, what's the solution?

30:04.135 --> 30:06.597
That's why you're here,
we need a simple solution

30:06.639 --> 30:08.891
to the Suarez kid situation.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.935
I hate that it comes down to this,

30:10.976 --> 30:13.729
but a signed confession and a suicide

30:13.771 --> 30:14.939
would be the best option.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.357
I don't know how we get there,

30:16.798 --> 30:19.318
but we'll leave that up to you. Yes?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.529
I-I agree with you,
this is the best option.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.565
Uh, the problem is Marisol.

30:23.590 --> 30:24.520
How do you keep her

30:24.545 --> 30:26.249
from losing her shit?
She's obsessed with this kid.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.513
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's become her whole world.

30:27.555 --> 30:29.703
- Well, that's your job, Tom.
- It's insane.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.515
I mean, I would love to do it
myself, but I don't know her...

30:31.540 --> 30:33.301
I've never met her before.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.209
You have a relationship with her,

30:35.251 --> 30:36.669
and we need her happy.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.337
Because if she's not happy
when she's mayor,

30:38.379 --> 30:41.549
then you don't get
your big, shiny buildings,

30:41.590 --> 30:44.510
and I don't get access
to Los Angeles ports.

30:44.552 --> 30:45.761
And then both of our businesses suffer.

30:45.803 --> 30:46.929
You see what I'm saying?

30:46.971 --> 30:48.922
I'm not saying this is easy,

30:48.964 --> 30:50.975
but you're Tom Wyatt,

30:51.016 --> 30:53.936
and there's nothing
Tom Wyatt can't do, right?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.523
Right?

30:59.483 --> 31:00.734
Yeah. Fuck, I don't know.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.778
Yes, "fuck" is absolutely right.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.180
No, go fix this, Tom.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.409
Oh, okay.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.519
Thanks.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.289
I got it, thank you.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.459
Roman's scared of something.

31:17.501 --> 31:18.902
I don't know what.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.715
Yeah, I don't really feel bad for him.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.262
Judge Wallace's clerk just called.

31:29.246 --> 31:30.973
Both the gun and the video footage

31:31.015 --> 31:32.224
are staying in evidence.

31:32.266 --> 31:33.559
Fuck.

31:33.601 --> 31:35.561
Do you need me to get any more info?

31:35.603 --> 31:38.397
- No, that's okay.
- I'm sorry.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.409
All right, what do you want to do?

31:50.934 --> 31:52.453
I don't know.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.942
I'm gonna run next door.

32:00.527 --> 32:01.879
You want to go?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.173
No, I don't want to go.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.085
Jesus! Don't sneak up on me like that.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.462
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Billy. How are you, man?

32:43.504 --> 32:45.673
- Got your hearing-aid in?
- Say again.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.674
Your hearing-aid.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.133
Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:48.175 --> 32:50.594
- How are ya?
- Oh, you know.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.847
So... what's up?

32:56.934 --> 32:58.477
Wallace screwed me.

32:59.044 --> 33:01.730
Yeah, you lost a battle.
The war's not over.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.734
Yeah, I know, but
it shouldn't be this hard.

33:06.134 --> 33:09.429
Prosecution doesn't even
really have much, you know?

33:10.572 --> 33:12.408
I'm not sure who I'm up against anymore.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.660
Give it a little time.
They'll stick their head out.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.537
- Yeah.
- Speaking of which,

33:16.578 --> 33:18.372
I understand you found Tito Garcia.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.208
- Yeah.
- Although not all of him.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.879
Well, the word on the street is
that this was no hack job.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.132
- This was surgical.
- This was...

33:28.173 --> 33:29.258
...professional.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.384
Any idea who?

33:31.743 --> 33:33.470
Could be La Mano Cartel.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.038
Head shows up.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.892
Well, in that case, maybe I should

33:38.934 --> 33:41.770
- move the family to Idaho, huh?
- No, no.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.105
If you were in the crosshairs
of the cartel,

33:43.147 --> 33:45.023
you wouldn't be standing here right now.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.651
Trust me.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.903
Why would they give a shit
about this kid, anyway?

33:49.945 --> 33:52.781
Since when is anything ever
about what it's about?

33:52.823 --> 33:54.616
Yeah.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.705
You know anything about
this cop, Keith Roman?

33:59.747 --> 34:01.915
Yeah. Yeah, I've run into him
a couple times.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.917
He seems to be okay.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.544
Of course, he's never arrested me.

34:07.004 --> 34:09.047
He's lead detective on a case

34:09.089 --> 34:10.382
that I'm consulting on.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.217
Gang shit, the usual.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.096
He's acting real guilty.
I'm not sure why.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.349
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.726
I know you will.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.770
You were hoping I'd know more than I do.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.021
Of course I was.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.190
Yeah, well,

34:26.231 --> 34:27.491
you know, the ground's not talking yet,

34:27.532 --> 34:30.402
but... it will, it always does.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.780
Yeah. Shake it a little, will ya?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.114
It's California, Billy.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.909
Don't need to shake it,
ground shakes on its own.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.204
And we're due for a big one.

34:43.219 --> 34:44.291
Now let's go.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.542
Let's go, motherfucker, serve.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.002
All right, fuck you.
It was slippery, all right?

34:47.043 --> 34:48.295
- Just fucking serve.
- That's from your sweat.

34:48.337 --> 34:51.924
- Just fucking go!
- Okay, I'm going.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.382
Eat this, motherfucker.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.015
Okay, all right, time. Time. Fuck! Time.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.767
- Time, time.
- You gotta play, man.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.435
Fuck.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.521
Jesus, when's the last time
you exercised, man?

35:05.562 --> 35:08.941
July of '87.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.851
I was getting ready
for the Poison Oak tour.

35:10.893 --> 35:12.402
Oh, shit, you're not gonna
tell me about your fucking band

35:12.444 --> 35:13.403
again, are you?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.780
Hey, we sort of opened up

35:14.822 --> 35:15.989
for Atomic Punks, all right?

35:16.031 --> 35:17.122
- You told me that.
- No, no.

35:17.164 --> 35:19.910
Listen, dude, I gotta go see
a doctor, 'cause...

35:19.952 --> 35:21.787
Dude, we've been playing for,
like, ten minutes.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.080
Do you have any Bayer aspirin?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.540
That's the stuff you need, right?

35:24.581 --> 35:26.074
You're not having
a heart attack, are you?

35:26.116 --> 35:28.946
Oh, yeah, you'd love that,
wouldn't you, Danny, you fuck?

35:28.988 --> 35:31.338
No, I might laugh at first,
but I'd call 911.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.006
Yeah, you'd laugh
throughout the whole thing.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.633
- You're an asshole.
- Let's go.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.301
Fuck you... you're the pussy.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.757
- Jesus Christ!
- You're the pussy.

35:37.799 --> 35:39.137
You're the pussy.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.098
Oh, I'm glad you guys are
having a good time in here.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.268
'Cause I just got back
from a romantic getaway for two

35:44.309 --> 35:45.727
to fucking Rosarito,

35:45.769 --> 35:47.646
where it almost cost me an arm and a leg,

35:47.688 --> 35:49.481
if you know what I'm talking
about, and I think you do.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.941
How's that my fault?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.821
Okay, I can see you two
have a lot to discuss,

35:55.863 --> 35:57.197
and three's a crowd, so I'll, uh...

35:57.239 --> 35:58.365
Can I borrow that for-for a second?

35:58.407 --> 35:59.533
- Just real quick?
- Yeah.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.493
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

36:01.535 --> 36:04.621
- Want to try that again?
- Tom... I'm sorry.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.914
How can I help?

36:05.956 --> 36:07.749
Thank you. I appreciate that.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.127
- Sure.
- So, things with Brittany

36:10.168 --> 36:12.198
are progressing nicely,
thanks to the tip from you.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.456
I appreciate that.

36:13.498 --> 36:15.625
However, the situation
with Marisol and the kid

36:15.667 --> 36:17.843
is becoming a little more complex.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.428
So I'm gonna need you

36:19.469 --> 36:20.929
to open up some more cash for us,

36:20.971 --> 36:23.436
so I can play the role
of sweet benefactor

36:23.477 --> 36:25.392
because she knows that I need her

36:25.434 --> 36:27.686
and she's grinding me
to the fucking wall on it.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.001
It's all about keeping Marisol happy,

36:30.042 --> 36:31.815
while at the same time
convincing her to come down

36:31.857 --> 36:33.275
on that fucking kid. Super easy, right?

36:33.317 --> 36:34.735
I should do it all on my own.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.862
- Right? Right?!
- N-N-N-No... I-I hear you, Tom,

36:36.904 --> 36:39.156
but-but why don't we just
take care of the kid?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.699
I mean, we've got guys on the inside.

36:40.741 --> 36:41.825
It doesn't have to be this hard.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.455
That's a pretty fucking good idea.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.540
I should have thought of that myself.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.083
- Thanks, Danny. Here you go.
- You're welcome.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.418
Fucker!

36:51.460 --> 36:53.378
Did you not fucking hear what I said?!

36:53.420 --> 36:55.455
I need to keep Marisol happy!

36:55.496 --> 36:58.425
You need to keep me fucking happy!

36:58.467 --> 37:01.386
Do I look happy to you, you fuck?!

37:01.428 --> 37:02.679
God!

37:04.681 --> 37:07.309
I do feel a little bit better, though.

37:08.001 --> 37:09.269
Thanks for that.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.897
Ow.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.899
- Good luck with it.
- Fuck.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.195
Why are we going in here?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.030
When you said walking distance,

37:20.072 --> 37:22.908
I didn't think you meant 100 feet.

37:22.950 --> 37:25.168
Yeah, I did. What's up, honey?

37:25.210 --> 37:27.070
- Please, have a seat.
- Yeah. Have a chair.

37:27.111 --> 37:29.803
- Welcome to Chez Jay.
- There you go.

37:29.845 --> 37:31.333
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, honey.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.293
Where's everyone?

37:33.777 --> 37:35.837
I bought the place for the night.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.173
It's just you and me and the gang here.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.803
Hi, boys.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.681
- Gracias.
- Frankie, I just ordered one flower.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.849
- Nice job.
- Yeah, they're pretty.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.602
Shit's real, too.
It's not one of those fake ones

37:50.644 --> 37:52.521
that just looks like a light. Yeah.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.523
I wouldn't know it
if it bit me on the ass.

37:54.564 --> 37:55.941
Yeah, just ask her.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.009
- Um, it looks amazing. Thank you.
- Okay.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.779
Carrot cake.

38:00.821 --> 38:03.365
You remembered. Thank you.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.367
Yeah, I pay attention sometimes.

38:05.409 --> 38:06.576
Uh, Billy, don't you have
something to say?

38:06.618 --> 38:07.869
Oh. Yeah, yeah, right.

38:07.911 --> 38:11.248
So, uh, you guys all rigged up there?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.291
All right. Got a little toast here.

38:13.333 --> 38:16.211
To our great old gal,
Los Angeles, California,

38:16.253 --> 38:18.505
and to the next mayor, Marisol Silva,

38:18.547 --> 38:20.828
and to our buddy, Oscar.

38:20.870 --> 38:23.635
God rest his soul.
What a fucking great guy.

38:24.244 --> 38:27.264
And, uh, one second, Lucho.

38:28.456 --> 38:31.893
I know. Fucking dude, right.

38:31.935 --> 38:37.065
So, uh, here's seagull shit in
the eyes of all the New Yorkers

38:37.107 --> 38:40.277
who come out here and love
the beaches and the weather

38:40.318 --> 38:43.739
and their jobs and shit like
that and still bitch about it.

38:44.097 --> 38:45.991
Fuck you all. Go home.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.116
I don't remember sending out
an invitation.

38:48.157 --> 38:49.424
- Here's to you.
- Hear, hear.

38:49.449 --> 38:51.288
Salud.

38:52.355 --> 38:55.250
Yeah, baby. Wanting it.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.526
Thanks, Frankie.

38:58.820 --> 39:03.341
So, it's just, uh, wine and carrot cake?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.552
- Well, did you want something else?
- Yes.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.262
I'm feeling some disappointment.
Like what?

39:07.304 --> 39:09.556
- Food.
- Food. Oh. Food.

39:09.598 --> 39:12.309
Oh, sorry. Gosh damn it.
I-I knew I forgot something.

39:13.126 --> 39:15.270
All right. Sorry about that.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.439
Well, anyway, we can still get drunk.

39:18.256 --> 39:19.357
I really...

39:19.399 --> 39:22.110
Hey, Lucho!

39:22.152 --> 39:23.528
You guys got any grub back there?

39:23.570 --> 39:24.988
- Oi!
- See there?

39:26.907 --> 39:28.408
What do you think, I'm an asshole?

39:28.450 --> 39:30.994
And he thought of everything.
Thanks, guys.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.329
Gracias.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.124
Bon appÃ©tit.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.417
Excellent. Thanks, Frankie.
Good job, honey.

39:37.459 --> 39:39.338
This is very nice. Thank you.

39:39.380 --> 39:40.962
Cool.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.593
No, I...

39:46.635 --> 39:47.928
I can't.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.846
I can't drink anymore.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.431
Oh, I bet you can.

39:51.473 --> 39:54.601
I'm not used to this.

39:54.643 --> 39:58.230
Usually, one glass of wine is my limit.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.065
Well, maybe two.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.733
Yeah.

40:02.383 --> 40:04.361
Some people are named Hymen.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.196
Mm...

40:07.489 --> 40:09.157
Can you imagine that?

40:10.016 --> 40:12.661
I mean, I think it's spelled
different, but goddamn.

40:12.702 --> 40:13.954
Can you imagine that shit?

40:13.995 --> 40:15.831
That's like being named Foreskin.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.542
Or testicle.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.252
That's gross.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.420
Yeah, it is.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.239
Well...

40:24.923 --> 40:27.050
sometimes it's pretty... helpful.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.635
I don't... I don't want
to hear about that.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.563
Do you know anything
about the La Mano Drug Cartel?

40:43.633 --> 40:45.986
Your brain, it's...

40:46.427 --> 40:47.821
really fucked up.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.991
Wait, how do you put together foreskin

40:51.032 --> 40:52.868
with a drug cartel?

40:52.909 --> 40:55.203
I wasn't putting together
foreskin and drug cartels.

40:55.245 --> 40:58.290
So, you know anything about 'em?

40:58.331 --> 40:59.583
Mm...

40:59.624 --> 41:00.942
Why?

41:02.318 --> 41:03.712
- Just do you know anything about 'em?
- You think...

41:03.753 --> 41:05.197
I want to know if you
know anything about 'em.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.048
Okay, so, because I'm Mexican,
do you think

41:07.090 --> 41:09.342
I know everything about drug cartels?

41:09.384 --> 41:11.219
No, I think 'cause you work
with the City Council

41:11.261 --> 41:12.389
Drug Task Force thing.

41:12.414 --> 41:13.847
- I think that's why...
- Oh...

41:13.889 --> 41:16.349
...you might know something,
not 'cause you're Mexican.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.185
Let's just not talk about work now.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.416
Mm-hmm.

41:19.441 --> 41:21.396
Tonight's supposed to be fun.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.023
It is fun.

41:23.548 --> 41:24.858
I'm having fun.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.612
So, you know anything about 'em?

41:29.654 --> 41:31.681
Why do you want to know?

41:33.141 --> 41:35.577
'Cause I think they're trying
to scare me off Julio's case.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.620
That's why.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.354
Oh.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.208
I don't...

41:41.249 --> 41:44.669
see the connection between the two.

41:47.822 --> 41:50.508
Do you know anything
about how they operate?

41:52.327 --> 41:55.889
Well, even if I did, there...

41:55.931 --> 41:58.391
You know, I can't discuss it.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.311
- It's privileged information.
- Mm.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.277
I'm not privileged?

42:03.318 --> 42:05.565
I think we have to have...

42:06.007 --> 42:09.861
some boundaries
when it comes to our work.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.615
Come to bed.

42:13.657 --> 42:16.493
Well, I just figured since, uh,
you're so interested in Julio

42:16.534 --> 42:18.745
and everything that, you know,

42:18.787 --> 42:20.956
maybe you'd like to help out
a little bit.

42:21.606 --> 42:24.000
I don't like the sound of that.

42:26.277 --> 42:27.820
What are...

42:28.863 --> 42:30.298
what are you insinuating?

42:30.740 --> 42:32.425
I'm not insinuating anything.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.177
I'm just saying that...

42:34.219 --> 42:36.346
you know, you-you came to me.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.848
I didn't come to you.
And it was about the case,

42:38.890 --> 42:40.350
so I figured you had some interest in it

42:40.392 --> 42:41.893
and if you could help, you would.

42:41.935 --> 42:43.561
That's all. You know? What am I gonna do,

42:43.603 --> 42:45.855
tell a fucking news station
or something? I'm...

42:45.897 --> 42:47.780
That's not what I'm trying
to do here, honey.

42:47.822 --> 42:49.317
I just need some information about 'em,

42:49.359 --> 42:50.735
and I figured maybe you have some.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.237
I don't know the connection either.

42:52.279 --> 42:53.363
That's what I'm trying to find out.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.532
But I told you, I can't discuss anything

42:55.573 --> 42:57.492
about my work with the Drug Task Force.

42:58.267 --> 43:00.287
It could endanger the whole operation

43:00.328 --> 43:02.330
if something slips out.

43:03.856 --> 43:05.083
Well, to tell you the truth,

43:05.125 --> 43:07.669
I'm feeling a little endangered myself.

43:07.711 --> 43:10.046
Does that mean anything to you?

43:15.927 --> 43:19.556
Let's just... stop this.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.767
Okay. Sorry.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.402
Let me ask you something else.

43:35.388 --> 43:37.907
What are you doing hanging around me?

43:38.266 --> 43:39.576
What do you mean?

43:39.617 --> 43:42.537
Well, I mean, you're beautiful,
and you're successful,

43:42.579 --> 43:44.289
and you hang out with all these
big shit fucking guys

43:44.331 --> 43:46.041
all the time, you know.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.821
What're you doing hanging around
in a shithole with me?

43:48.862 --> 43:50.086
That's all.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.136
I like spending time with you.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.430
And, you know,

44:00.472 --> 44:02.260
I said I agreed

44:02.302 --> 44:04.667
when you said, "We're fucked."

44:07.378 --> 44:09.147
What do you think that means to me?

44:09.714 --> 44:11.799
I know what it means to me.

44:12.901 --> 44:14.611
What does it mean to you, exactly?

44:16.373 --> 44:18.119
Because I thought we were...

44:18.160 --> 44:19.949
...close enough to where I could actually

44:19.991 --> 44:22.118
ask you a fucking question
about something important,

44:22.160 --> 44:23.870
- and instead of...
- Why are you being aggressive?

44:23.912 --> 44:25.663
- I don't under... Why...
- I'm not being aggressive.

44:25.705 --> 44:26.873
- But now I...
- I'm try...

44:26.915 --> 44:28.666
I don't understand what
you're doing, right now.

44:28.708 --> 44:31.336
You see, we're talking about
a fucking drug cartel here,

44:31.378 --> 44:33.129
- and I'm telling you...
- What are you doing?

44:33.171 --> 44:34.337
- I don't understand what you're...
- ...that I think

44:34.379 --> 44:35.815
they're trying to push me out
of this fucking thing for

44:35.857 --> 44:39.132
some reason, and they don't fuck
around, as you probably know.

44:39.173 --> 44:41.638
- Why-Why are you being like...
- I'd like to keep the top half

44:41.679 --> 44:43.681
of my body attached
to the bottom half of my body.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.392
- Wow.
- Yeah.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.936
Th-Then that's... Now, it's my fault.

44:47.977 --> 44:49.729
- I don't understand...
- Who said it was your fault?

44:49.771 --> 44:51.481
I didn't say a fucking word
about it being your fault.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.899
- You're being just selfish...
- No.

44:52.941 --> 44:54.281
...and you're just got too much to drink.

44:54.322 --> 44:56.069
- A-Actually, no. What I'm saying is...
- Okay...

44:56.111 --> 44:57.987
...I thought we were close. I
thought we were fucking friends,

44:58.029 --> 44:59.614
and all of a sudden
we can't talk about your work?

44:59.656 --> 45:01.658
- Ah, we were fucking friends? Great.
- You're... You know what?

45:01.699 --> 45:03.034
- Okay, no.
- That's how this started out.

45:03.076 --> 45:05.120
- I'm not talking...
- Was your work and my work.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.871
I think you've just had
too much to drink.

45:06.913 --> 45:08.540
- No, I didn't have too much to drink.
- Yes.

45:08.581 --> 45:10.542
As a matter of fact,
I could use a little more.

45:11.526 --> 45:14.254
I was trying to talk to you

45:14.295 --> 45:15.720
because I thought we were close enough...

45:15.761 --> 45:16.668
- To do that...
- I don't like this.

45:16.693 --> 45:17.680
I don't like this bullshit.

45:17.721 --> 45:18.968
- Really?
- Yes. I'm not gonna talk to you

45:18.993 --> 45:20.260
when you're drunk.

45:20.301 --> 45:22.178
- That's it.
- Oh, okay.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.888
- Yeah.
- Well, good luck.

45:23.930 --> 45:27.041
You'll talk to me about
five minutes a fucking month.

45:28.685 --> 45:30.562
- Why are you being so hostile?
- Look, I know I'm not the

45:30.603 --> 45:31.813
smartest fucking guy in the room,

45:31.855 --> 45:34.190
and I ain't the prettiest
fucking guy in the room.

45:34.232 --> 45:35.984
- That's for fucking sure.
- That's not true.

45:36.025 --> 45:37.735
And you know what?
I talked you into this.

45:37.777 --> 45:39.612
You didn't talk me into it, okay?

45:39.654 --> 45:41.614
- That's not true. That's not...
- Wasn't the other way around.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.658
I'm afraid it is true. Yeah.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.208
Maybe we shouldn't be seen
together in public, either.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.734
Oh...

45:54.502 --> 45:55.837
Where... What are you doing?

45:55.879 --> 45:57.088
I wouldn't want your fucking suits.

45:57.130 --> 45:58.196
I'm going out for a minute.

45:58.238 --> 46:01.242
The walls are getting a little
close to me in here. Okay?

46:16.966 --> 46:19.986
- Yeah?
- Keith. Hakeem.

46:20.028 --> 46:22.238
Listen, I know McBride tried
to throw you off your game.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.157
Just wanted you to know
that Wallace didn't buy it.

46:24.199 --> 46:27.619
- So the gun is in?
- The gun and the videos.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.996
Yes!

46:30.038 --> 46:33.208
That's great, man.
That's... as it should be.

46:33.249 --> 46:34.667
Yeah, McBride's probably
shitting in his pants

46:34.709 --> 46:35.960
- right about now.
- Yeah.

46:36.002 --> 46:38.405
- Well, he deserves it.
- Yeah, he does.

46:38.446 --> 46:40.840
He tried to attack you
and it backfired on him,

46:40.882 --> 46:43.176
so the good guys won today, right?

46:43.218 --> 46:46.037
Yeah. Thanks for the call.

46:46.079 --> 46:47.847
All right. Talk to you later.

47:07.850 --> 47:09.118
Hey, Martha.

47:09.143 --> 47:11.538
I knew you were gonna screw me
on the gun, Your Honor.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.629
I'm sorry. I knew you were
gonna screw me on the gun,

47:13.671 --> 47:15.404
but you let the video in? Seriously?

47:15.445 --> 47:18.086
Good morning to you, too, Billy.
This is highly inappropriate.

47:18.127 --> 47:19.420
If you want to discuss this,

47:19.462 --> 47:20.880
I think Mr. Rashad should be present.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.174
Your Honor, please reconsider your order.

47:23.216 --> 47:25.093
Take it up on appeal.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.381
Well, we don't have time for an appeal.

47:26.423 --> 47:28.346
Listen, since we started this case,

47:28.388 --> 47:31.015
our client lost his only alibi,
who was shot and killed,

47:31.057 --> 47:32.559
then the prime suspect

47:32.600 --> 47:35.562
gets deported to Mexico
and beheaded, by the way.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.730
And then, magically,
the murder weapon appears

47:37.772 --> 47:39.607
just outside our client's home.

47:39.649 --> 47:42.151
JT believes it has something
to do with the La Mano Cartel,

47:42.193 --> 47:44.153
and I don't doubt him, whatsoever, okay?

47:44.195 --> 47:46.781
Stop right there.
I-It's the murder weapon.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.908
Whether the jury ties this to your client

47:48.950 --> 47:50.743
or not depends upon your argument

47:50.785 --> 47:52.453
and the evidence you bring in the room.

47:52.495 --> 47:56.165
And as far as the video goes,
as you so ably argued,

47:56.207 --> 47:58.835
it supports your theory
the gun was planted.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.545
You would have brought it
into trial anyway.

48:01.070 --> 48:02.630
If you want to exonerate your client,

48:02.672 --> 48:05.592
you're gonna need proof,
so bring me evidence

48:05.633 --> 48:08.975
of this conspiracy,
not just JT's wild hunches,

48:09.017 --> 48:10.680
and then maybe we'll have
something to talk about.

48:10.722 --> 48:11.848
Thank you, Your Honor.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.559
Don't thank me. I haven't done anything.

48:16.644 --> 48:20.648
But I get it, Mr. McBride.

48:20.690 --> 48:23.276
You've planted the seed
of conspiracy into my head

48:23.676 --> 48:25.612
and you've ruined my coffee.

48:26.911 --> 48:28.096
Now go.

48:28.222 --> 48:30.850
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry.

48:31.618 --> 48:34.037
Oh, and if JT wants to come by and chat,

48:34.078 --> 48:35.288
he knows where to find me.

48:35.330 --> 48:36.331
Okay.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.291
- You want this pushed back in?
- Go.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.334
Okay.

49:11.616 --> 49:12.796
Yo.

49:12.838 --> 49:15.203
Tito, he thought he was
some fucking tough guy.

49:15.244 --> 49:17.789
- He was a fucking midget.
- Working with the cops.

49:17.830 --> 49:20.581
Making all this money.
I never saw any of it.

49:20.623 --> 49:23.002
Maybe that other twat he was banging did.

49:23.044 --> 49:24.754
Ugh. He was a fucking rat bitch.

49:24.796 --> 49:26.422
No, no, no, no, no.

49:26.464 --> 49:29.377
More like a mouse.
He's not big enough to be a rat.

49:29.418 --> 49:30.802
Oh, shit!

49:30.843 --> 49:33.262
Did you see that rat
with that slice of pizza?

49:33.304 --> 49:35.056
That rat fucking loved pizza.

49:36.849 --> 49:39.239
Yo, my cousin sent me that.
Did you see it?

49:39.281 --> 49:42.647
- I did. Fascinating.
- Fucking hilarious.

49:42.689 --> 49:44.784
Did Tito ever mention a cop by name?

49:44.826 --> 49:45.900
Yeah.

49:45.942 --> 49:47.953
Even without his fucking head,

49:47.995 --> 49:50.279
- his mouth's probably still running.
- Oh, dude.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.739
That is dark.

49:51.781 --> 49:55.144
- It's dark, but it's true.
- Girl.

49:55.186 --> 49:59.122
Damn, what is that cop's name?
I know I know it.

49:59.163 --> 50:01.124
Stop chasing it. It'll come to you.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.746
Tranquilo, huh? Calma.

50:03.359 --> 50:05.419
Look. I'm gonna enjoy the ride

50:05.460 --> 50:07.422
and the lovely company.

50:07.463 --> 50:09.841
- Oh!
- Look at you!

50:09.882 --> 50:11.467
- Charmer.
- Okay. Oh, yeah.

50:11.509 --> 50:12.677
- Yeah.
- He's cute.

50:12.719 --> 50:14.120
I think he's flirting with you, girl.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.188
Hi.

50:24.230 --> 50:25.525
Hi.

50:25.550 --> 50:27.489
Um, how are you? I'm-I'm
sorry to bother you.

50:27.531 --> 50:28.943
You could never bother me.

50:28.985 --> 50:30.862
Is your father here?

50:30.903 --> 50:34.198
No, he's actually not,
but do you want to come in?

50:34.807 --> 50:36.659
- Is...
- Sure, thank you.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.060
...is everything okay?

50:39.287 --> 50:41.622
Uh, we... no...

50:41.664 --> 50:44.022
We had an awkward conversation
last night,

50:44.791 --> 50:48.171
and he said he was gonna go
for a walk, but never came back.

50:48.212 --> 50:51.090
Yeah, sorry about that. He, um...

50:51.132 --> 50:54.141
He disappears, sometimes.

50:54.183 --> 50:56.999
Sometimes for an hour,
sometimes for a couple days,

50:57.040 --> 51:00.183
but don't worry, he'll be back

51:00.224 --> 51:02.477
- and pretend like nothing happened.
- Okay.

51:02.518 --> 51:04.020
- I'll text him.
- Thank you.

51:04.061 --> 51:07.815
Yeah, he... he has a unique personality.

51:07.857 --> 51:09.675
That's one way of putting it.

51:10.337 --> 51:13.053
- Um, would you like some water?
- Sure, thank you.

51:14.197 --> 51:15.740
It's a beautiful home.

51:15.782 --> 51:18.242
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

51:18.284 --> 51:21.662
You know, I told him
not to screw it up with you.

51:21.704 --> 51:24.040
You're the best thing that's
happened to him in a while.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.041
Really?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.918
Oh, yeah, by far.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.878
He has a tendency

51:28.920 --> 51:32.089
to screw things up
when they're good for him.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.551
But he's crazy about you.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.761
He said that?

51:36.803 --> 51:40.556
No, I just... I-I can tell.

51:40.598 --> 51:41.790
Mm.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.562
Ooh! You know what? I almost forgot.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.273
I brought you this.

51:49.315 --> 51:50.775
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

51:50.817 --> 51:52.401
You can put it in your car, or...

51:52.443 --> 51:54.487
Thank you. That's really, really sweet.

51:54.529 --> 51:55.930
- Oh, my pleasure.
- Um...

51:57.865 --> 52:01.327
Yeah, no response yet,
but it's not unusual.

52:01.369 --> 52:02.912
Right.

52:02.954 --> 52:05.998
I know he's under a lot of
pressure lately with this case.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.333
Hmm.

52:07.375 --> 52:09.335
Did he talk to you about it?

52:09.377 --> 52:11.254
Oh, no. He's...

52:11.295 --> 52:13.422
he's pretty private about that stuff.

52:13.464 --> 52:17.927
Huh. Yeah, he said something
about the FBI

52:17.969 --> 52:20.955
now looking for another suspect.

52:21.430 --> 52:24.416
That's probably in his mind right now.

52:25.184 --> 52:26.894
Mmm.

52:26.936 --> 52:29.522
You know what? You guys are really close.

52:29.564 --> 52:30.731
I think it would be good

52:30.773 --> 52:32.275
for him if you talk to him.

52:32.316 --> 52:33.734
You know, and ask him about it.

52:33.776 --> 52:34.944
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:34.986 --> 52:36.445
Yeah, I could, I could do that.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.448
But just don't mention that I,

52:39.490 --> 52:41.450
you know, said-said this to you...

52:41.492 --> 52:43.149
- No, totally.
- Because I don't want him to think

52:43.191 --> 52:44.478
that I'm prying.

52:45.329 --> 52:47.498
I'm just worried about him.

53:40.693 --> 53:41.902
Hey.

53:41.927 --> 53:44.889
Hey. What's up?

53:46.641 --> 53:48.935
- How're you doing?
- All right.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.758
You know, you don't
have to dance around me.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.695
- What do you mean?
- I just mean, like,

53:59.737 --> 54:03.324
if something's wrong or if, you know,

54:03.366 --> 54:05.534
work's not going well or whatever,

54:05.576 --> 54:07.161
that you can talk to me.

54:09.288 --> 54:11.290
What makes you think
work's not going okay?

54:11.332 --> 54:13.233
Nothing. I just...

54:14.126 --> 54:15.753
Jesus, I'm just trying to let you know

54:15.795 --> 54:17.196
that I'm here for you.

54:19.490 --> 54:21.342
All right.

54:24.637 --> 54:26.597
Marisol came by.

54:26.639 --> 54:27.890
What?

54:27.932 --> 54:29.625
Marisol came by.

54:31.727 --> 54:33.104
Came by where?

54:33.465 --> 54:35.342
The house.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.567
What'd she say?

54:40.235 --> 54:43.263
I mean, you know,
she's worried about you.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.284
She doesn't know you that well.

54:47.326 --> 54:50.813
Dad, she hasn't had time to get
used to your disappearing act.

54:59.505 --> 55:01.031
I'll call her.

55:01.549 --> 55:03.551
- You should.
- Yeah.

55:03.592 --> 55:05.428
One of the coolest women
in town likes you,

55:05.469 --> 55:06.679
so don't be an asshole.

55:07.371 --> 55:09.140
What else did she say?

55:10.891 --> 55:14.145
Nothing. She's just, you know,
worried and...

55:20.192 --> 55:22.778
So... anything new on the case,

55:22.820 --> 55:25.448
or with work or...

55:25.489 --> 55:28.308
Nothing you want to talk about?

55:28.826 --> 55:30.369
No.

55:39.128 --> 55:41.130
Hey, this is Billy. Leave a message.

55:41.172 --> 55:44.759
Billy, the ground has opened up.

55:45.451 --> 55:48.345
And it's talking.

56:08.432 --> 56:09.867
What the fuck are you doing?

56:09.909 --> 56:13.079
When were you gonna tell me
Tito Garcia was your CI?

56:14.480 --> 56:16.207
Who told you that?

56:16.248 --> 56:17.691
A little bird.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.211
It kind of puts an interesting spin

56:20.252 --> 56:21.962
on everything that's happened
kind of, doesn't it?

56:22.905 --> 56:24.507
Doesn't mean dick.

56:24.865 --> 56:27.384
The guy worked for you
and you never even mentioned it.

56:27.426 --> 56:30.221
He was a confidential informant.

56:32.539 --> 56:34.642
You wouldn't even pick him up
for questioning.

56:36.126 --> 56:37.645
You don't know shit, McBride.

56:37.686 --> 56:39.355
Well, then tell me.

56:43.609 --> 56:45.552
The way I see it,

56:46.278 --> 56:48.572
you're the low man on the totem pole now,

56:48.614 --> 56:52.326
'cause the guy below you,
his head's in a box.

56:52.851 --> 56:54.370
Look, I can get you a deal.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.372
I can protect you.
I can protect your family.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.916
But you got to give me enough
to take to the prosecution.

57:00.626 --> 57:03.295
You might want to consider my offer.

57:03.337 --> 57:05.297
'Cause I ain't gonna kill you.

57:05.339 --> 57:08.676
Can you say the same thing
about the other guys?
