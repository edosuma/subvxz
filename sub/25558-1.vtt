00:21.480 --> 00:24.320
[clock ticks]

00:31.160 --> 00:32.560
[bang echoes]

00:32.640 --> 00:36.000
[ticking grows louder]

00:42.080 --> 00:44.600
[Derren Brown]
Now, this moment, right now...

00:45.600 --> 00:47.520
is all there ever is.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.480
[happy, jazzy tune plays]

00:53.360 --> 00:57.120
Any book on happiness is likely
to tell you to set clear goals

00:57.200 --> 01:00.640
on what you want to achieve
and then work towards achieving them.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.000
The problem is, it doesn't really work.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.519
You might become a millionaire
by the time you're 40,

01:05.600 --> 01:09.000
but then you realise you haven't been
able to sustain a happy relationship,

01:09.080 --> 01:12.200
or when it doesn't work out
you feel lost and you blame yourself.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.760
When we live for our goals,
we forget to live now.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.800
The philosopher Alan Watts
made the point

01:17.880 --> 01:20.840
that when you listen to a piece of music
you don't just skip to the end

01:20.920 --> 01:23.040
because that's where
it all comes together.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.720
You don't just read the last chapter
of a book because that's the climax,

01:26.800 --> 01:29.440
yet in life we're obsessed with endings.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.200
So you study for these exams,
so you can go to this university,

01:32.280 --> 01:35.480
to get this job,
to work your way up to, what?

01:35.560 --> 01:39.400
Eventually, you reach some position
in your 50s and you think, "Is this it?

01:39.480 --> 01:42.600
Is this the thing? Is this
what I've been working for?"

01:42.680 --> 01:46.760
And you forget that maybe life
should be more like a piece of music,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.760
and you're supposed to be dancing.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.600
[music ends]

01:51.680 --> 01:53.880
-[cheering and applause]
-Hello!

01:54.880 --> 01:56.840
Good evening!
Thank you very much.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.280
Talking of the future, here's something
for the future, a black envelope

02:08.360 --> 02:11.880
with the number 16
mysteriously printed on the front,

02:11.960 --> 02:13.760
which I'm going to give to you, sir.
What's your name?

02:13.840 --> 02:14.840
Chris.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.280
Chris. Take it, Chris. I'll get it
off you at the end. Don't open it.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.720
-Don't let anybody take it off you, Chris.
-[laughter]

02:19.800 --> 02:22.960
So it's not just the future that we tend
to fixate upon, it's also the past.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.560
We tend to dwell on our past and we
think that it somehow defines who we are.

02:26.640 --> 02:32.080
But our pasts are just stories that
we tell ourselves in the present, yes?

02:32.160 --> 02:34.400
When we say, "I'm this sort of person
because this happened to me."

02:34.480 --> 02:36.240
Or, "I'm a lucky person
or unlucky person."

02:36.320 --> 02:38.160
Whatever it is, they're just stories.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.640
And we can be more sceptical
of those stories if it helps us.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.320
See, if this were the start of a film
and it said "based on a true story",

02:45.400 --> 02:48.400
you would know that the events
that were going to happen in that film

02:48.480 --> 02:50.960
were not real events
exactly as they happened,

02:51.040 --> 02:54.400
but a tidied-up version with a neat
beginning, middle and an end.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.360
You'd be naturally sceptical.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.640
In the same way you come and see this
show. You know that I'm going to sometimes

02:59.720 --> 03:02.800
sell you a story that isn't quite true,
cos that's what we've agreed to, yes?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.640
-[laughter]
-You are naturally sceptical.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.040
We forget to apply
the same natural scepticism

03:07.120 --> 03:11.040
to the most important stories we have,
the ones we tell ourselves every day

03:11.120 --> 03:14.520
about who we are, and we can
choose to change those stories.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.680
So we'll play with stories. There's an
usher going around with a pen and paper.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.000
I want two of you to grab a pen and paper.
I won't ask you up on stage, don't worry.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.160
So, please do it, and then we're
all going to do a brain fart together.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.360
This is a little exercise just to clear
your mind of your initial thoughts.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.720
I'm going to be asking you to think
of lots of things during the show.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.040
Don't want you all thinking
of the same things, right?

03:34.120 --> 03:37.640
So everybody do this. Imagine
you are looking at the front page

03:37.720 --> 03:39.840
of a Sunday newspaper.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.360
Alright? Imagine it's from weeks and
weeks ago, so you're not distracted by

03:43.440 --> 03:45.120
any topical events, it's not about that.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.680
And then as you look at this front page,
just let any three words

03:47.760 --> 03:51.440
just float out of the text at you,
any three random words.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.760
Alright? Make a mental note
of what they are. Do that for me.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.280
Those of you with a pen and paper make
an actual note of your brain fart words.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.680
Everybody else, on the count of three,
shout out the words you just thought of.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.320
Ready? One, two, three.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.360
[audience shouts different words]

04:05.440 --> 04:08.280
Some of you secretly hoping you were
going to shout the same three words.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.440
One night you will and I'll end
the show there, that'll be it.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.280
Great, good.
That was your brain fart exercise.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.680
Hopefully, your mind is now
cleared of your initial thoughts.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.480
Now we're going to make up a story. We'll
do this through a game of consequences.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.080
Do you know this game?
Normally, you write a bit of a story,

04:23.160 --> 04:25.760
fold it over, next person writes the next
bit, but haven't seen what you've written.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.640
You keep going. You end up with a mad
story. So we'll do a version of this.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.280
Anyone got a three-foot balloon?
Perfectly round, looks like a globe? No?

04:32.360 --> 04:34.560
Not one of you? Don't worry I have one.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.600
[laughter]

04:36.680 --> 04:40.440
So somebody grab the balloon and we're
going to start off a game of consequences.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.880
Stand up with it, please. Up you get.
Lovely to meet you. Up you get, up, up!

04:44.960 --> 04:46.440
[applause]

04:46.520 --> 04:48.680
Hi. There should be an usher
with a microphone.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.000
Ah, there it is. You got it. Thank you
so much. Hi. Hello, what's your name?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.920
-Caroline.
-Caroline.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.720
I've based a 20-year career
on essentially two skills.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.280
Firstly, the ability to pluck
a thought from your head.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.880
Secondly, the ability to get one into your
head. That's what we'll do now, Caroline.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.040
-Are you ready?
-OK.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.240
So, Caroline, I'm going to ask you to give
me a character for a game of consequences.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.600
I'm already thinking of one.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.040
And I'm going to try and make you say
the one that I want you to think of.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.640
Right? So you could say someone famous,
as long as they are really, really famous.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.520
So, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna,
somebody that we'd all know.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.080
Or it could be fictitious,
like a made-up famous character.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.360
Superman, right?
Daffy Duck. Boris Johnson.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.360
-Whatever you like.
-[laughter]

05:29.440 --> 05:31.960
Don't think of the ones I've said.
Think of your own one, Caroline.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.080
-Can you think of one? Yes or no?
-Yes, got one.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.840
Have you got one in your head?
OK, great.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.920
-Who is it?
-Mickey Mouse.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.840
Mickey Mouse, right?
Mickey Mouse, great. Thank you.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.320
So we have our character, Mickey Mouse.
Those of you playing with pens and paper,

05:49.400 --> 05:52.080
write down your own character,
anyone you like,

05:52.160 --> 05:55.200
then fold the paper up and
pass it along to the next person.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.440
Caroline, you're going to try and get
the balloon upstairs to the next level.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.520
-Ooh, somebody catch it up there!
-[laughter]

06:01.600 --> 06:04.040
-Go on! Yes!
-[audience cheers]

06:04.120 --> 06:07.320
-[applause]
-Beautifully done. Thank you.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.320
-Hi. What's your name?
-[Scottish accent] Grant.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.080
"Grant", I think you'll find
it's pronounced.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.480
[laughter]

06:13.560 --> 06:17.920
Grant, so now I need an object from you.
Something a character could hold.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.600
Of course, now you know what I'm doing,
trying to get an object into your head,

06:21.680 --> 06:25.400
so you'll start to think of the opposite
of what you think I want you to do.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.960
So the moment I hold my head
and say that,

06:28.040 --> 06:30.000
you'll think, "Maybe he wants me
to go for something around a head?"

06:30.080 --> 06:31.840
So I won't say a head or a hat or a wig,

06:31.920 --> 06:35.320
I'll go for an item of clothing, like
socks or shoes. That'll catch him out.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.040
Weirdly, you can become more predictable
the more you try to catch me out.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.640
I want you to think of the one thing you
don't think that I want you to think of

06:42.720 --> 06:44.640
and then say that, Grant. Alright?

06:44.720 --> 06:47.280
So holding what? Anything you like,
anything in the world. Go on, say it.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.120
-Pencil sharpener.
-A pencil sharpener.

06:51.200 --> 06:56.000
Thank you so much.
Mickey Mouse holding a pencil sharpener.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.880
Those of you playing with pens and paper
write down your own object,

06:59.960 --> 07:03.480
fold the paper up, pass it along
to the next person in your row.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.720
OK, Grant, give it another throw. OK?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.720
Thank you. Grant, you can sit down.
Somebody stand up with it.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.880
Catch it and stand.
Up you get. Up, up, up!

07:09.960 --> 07:11.680
-[applause]
-Up!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.240
-Er, what's your name?
-Alison.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.640
We're after another object. This time
something a character could sit on.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.280
-Anything you like, go, say it.
-Dog bed.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.240
Dog bed. Perfect, thank you.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.800
A dog bed. Alright, never mind.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.760
Those of you playing with a pen
and paper write down an object,

07:30.840 --> 07:33.600
something a character could sit on, fold
it up, pass it along to the next person.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.480
Alison, give it another throw. Keep it
downstairs for the last one, please.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.880
A good throw. Great!

07:38.960 --> 07:42.600
Excellent throw, somebody catch that
downstairs and stand up with it, please.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.520
Great. Oh! Up you get.
Oh, you'll be perfect. Stand up for me.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.040
Let me see you. You'll be amazing.
What's your name?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
Caroline.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.320
Caroline again! Excellent, good.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.800
I need you to finish off the story now
with something a character could say.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.560
I don't think I need to work to get this
in your head. I think it's already there.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.640
So it's something a character
could say. Not a word,

08:01.720 --> 08:05.000
but like a phrase or
a catchphrase or a slogan.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.320
Alright? So those of you playing with
the pen and paper write something down,

08:08.400 --> 08:11.360
something a character could say.
Don't worry that it's Mickey Mouse

08:11.440 --> 08:14.280
holding a pencil sharpener.
It can be anything you like.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.040
And says what? Go!

08:16.120 --> 08:18.880
"G'd day, campers."

08:18.960 --> 08:22.320
"G'd day, campers." Great!

08:22.400 --> 08:24.960
-[laughter]
-Keep hold of the balloon.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.400
"G'day...

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
campers."

08:29.640 --> 08:33.360
From the well-known
Australian edition of <i>Hi-de-Hi! Good.</i>

08:33.440 --> 08:35.760
Stay right there. Those of you
playing with the pens and paper,

08:35.840 --> 08:37.600
you've written down
something to finish off the story.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.480
Fold it up, pass them down the aisle.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.919
Can somebody hang on to
both of them, please, for me?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Caroline, you're going to get
yourself up here with the balloon.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.120
But also, I want you to go
and collect the stories too.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.800
So if you work your way round the back,
you're going to grab...

08:49.880 --> 08:51.760
grab the stories and then
bring everything up here.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.040
Give her a big hand as she comes up.
Caroline, everybody! First person up!

08:55.120 --> 08:57.640
-[applause]
-Very exciting. Oh!

08:57.720 --> 09:00.160
As Caroline does this...

09:01.200 --> 09:05.520
Something I should say as she does
this, no stooges used in the show.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.200
This is so important, no stooges.
No one's playing along.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.320
Grab the stories, Caroline.
Have you got them?

09:10.400 --> 09:13.680
You've got them? OK. Give her another
hand as she comes up. Lovely to meet you.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.560
-[applause]
-Hi.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.320
Come and stand here. Lovely.
You've got the stories?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.520
Great. So look, I was trying
to influence you, Caroline,

09:23.600 --> 09:25.760
and the other people
that caught this balloon

09:25.840 --> 09:27.960
to tell a particular story
one line at a time.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.600
I was not trying to influence
the people that wrote these down.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.960
So just to show you that this story
really could have gone anywhere,

09:34.040 --> 09:36.360
could have been anything, we're
going to read out one of these stories.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.120
Just open one up. If they haven't
done it, we'll read out the other one.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.480
Keep hold of the balloon. It'll be funny
watching you struggle. So open one up.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.160
If they haven't done it,
we'll read out the other one.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.480
Otherwise, we'll stick with that one.
They have done it.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.000
Nicely done. I'll take the other one
off you, so we don't get confused.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.080
Do you want to read...?
OK, that is the weirdest brain fart.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.440
[laughter]

09:53.520 --> 09:55.880
Three random words...
Just read those out into the mic.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.960
-Private, court, blender.
-[laughter]

09:59.040 --> 10:02.680
Private, court, blender. What weird,
dark place does that come from?

10:02.760 --> 10:05.040
Alright, never mind.
Let's do the story.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.400
So do you want to give us
the character, please? First of all?

10:08.480 --> 10:10.320
It's Camilla Parker Bowles.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.680
[he laughs]
Camilla Parker Bowles, very good.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.800
Camilla Parker Bowles, holding?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.600
A small dog.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.560
A small dog.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.200
-Sits on?
-A cucumber.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.640
[laughter]

10:25.720 --> 10:28.600
I did not expect that
from a London audience.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.000
-[laughter]
-Have some respect for the monarchy.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.920
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.
Sits on a cucumber and says...

10:38.920 --> 10:40.440
[laughter]

10:40.520 --> 10:42.960
"You've grown since I last saw you."

10:43.040 --> 10:44.640
[laughter]

10:44.720 --> 10:46.560
[applause]

10:49.320 --> 10:51.680
Oh, Christ!

10:51.760 --> 10:54.840
-"You've grown..."
-[laughter]

10:54.920 --> 10:58.400
"Since..." Is it,
"Since I last saw you"? "Since I last...

10:58.480 --> 11:01.560
saw... you."

11:01.640 --> 11:03.160
Excellent story. Well done.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.280
That's a particularly fine example
of anywhere that it could have gone.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.040
In fact, I think I will keep that one
as a souvenir. Great, alright.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.720
So, I wasn't trying to influence them,
but I was trying to influence you

11:12.800 --> 11:15.280
and the other people that caught this
balloon to tell a story, a line at a time.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.320
There is something
inside the balloon, Caroline.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.200
-If you shake it, can you hear it?
-Yep.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.080
If you hold it up and look, you might
even be able to see it. Can you?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.080
It's just a bit of paper rattling
around inside, just there.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.640
-Yep.
-Lovely.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.160
So, Caroline, if you hold it out for me
like that in your left hand, so like that.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.040
Straight up, but so it hangs down
rather than out...

11:35.120 --> 11:38.000
Then just scrunch it up a little bit, so
it doesn't move around too much. Great.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.320
And I'm going to give you this.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.680
-[audience] Oh!
- Oh, yes.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.200
So you're going to pop the balloon
and then pick up the piece of paper.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.720
You all need to watch where the paper
goes, cos sometimes it ends up going

11:48.800 --> 11:51.480
right under me or under here or
off the stage, or right to the wing.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.880
So, go on. I'll keep out the way.
Pop the balloon, go.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.600
There it is. I hope some of you
saw that. Pick it up for me.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.960
And bring yourself back
to the microphone, thank you.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.240
Right.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.360
Don't open it yet.
Drop the balloon on the floor.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.120
Hand me the pin, so you don't harm
either one of us. Thank you so much.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.720
And we'll do this one line at a time.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.480
Opening it, like a game
of consequences, right?

12:12.560 --> 12:14.440
Lovely, one little bit at a time.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.520
You're going to read out
just the top section.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.480
There you go, alright go on.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.120
"I'll ask the people who catch
this balloon to make up any story."

12:22.200 --> 12:25.280
Any story, alright? Any story.
And this is what you said.

12:25.360 --> 12:29.960
You said, "Mickey Mouse, holding
a pencil sharpener, sits on a dog bed

12:30.040 --> 12:32.320
and says, 'G'day Campers.'" Alright?

12:32.400 --> 12:35.520
You really could have said anything,
and that last bit came out of your mouth.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.560
You could have said anything,
anything at all.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.520
I hope that all absolutely felt like free
choices. So, yeah, go on, keep going.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.880
"This is what I will try
to get into their heads."

12:45.960 --> 12:47.920
OK. This is what I'll try
and get into their heads.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.840
Go on, nice and slowly,
take it one line at a time.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.840
-"Mickey Mouse".
- Mickey Mouse.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.800
Let's just enjoy this feeling
as it sinks in.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.120
[laughter]

12:56.200 --> 12:58.880
This was in the balloon as it was
bouncing around. Mickey Mouse...

12:58.960 --> 13:03.400
-"Holding a pencil sharpener."
-A pencil sharpener.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.960
"Sits on...

13:07.160 --> 13:08.640
a sun bed."

13:08.720 --> 13:09.760
Wanker!

13:09.840 --> 13:12.520
[laughter]

13:12.600 --> 13:13.960
A sun bed.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.520
And says...

13:17.360 --> 13:18.920
[laughter]

13:19.000 --> 13:20.800
"G'day, campers."
-G'day, campers!

13:20.880 --> 13:23.280
Thank you so much!
You were lovely. Mwah!

13:23.360 --> 13:26.600
Thank you so much. You can sit
yourself back down. Caroline, everybody!

13:26.680 --> 13:30.520
-[cheering and applause]
-Let's get somebody down from the top.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.360
Ooh, yes!

13:33.440 --> 13:35.040
Great, good, lovely!

13:35.120 --> 13:38.880
Nearest lady get yourself down here.
Get yourself down here, madam.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.960
Quickly. Thank you so much.
Thank you, wonderful.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.160
Thanks for coming all the way down.
What's your name?

13:47.240 --> 13:49.920
-Sarah.
- Sarah, hello. Come and have a seat.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.480
I've booked us a little table for two.
Hope that wasn't too forward.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.760
Sit yourself down.
Are you OK with apples, Sarah?

13:55.840 --> 13:56.840
Yeah.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.160
Yeah. Would you take a few bites for me?
It's actually quite important. Thank you.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.360
Great, you can head back up to your seat.
Thank you so much for coming down.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.800
-Joking. Water?
-Oh, thank you.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.000
-[laughter]
-Cheers, Sarah.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.280
Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming...
It is Sarah, isn't it?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.040
-Yes, it is.
-OK, right.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.160
So, Sarah, here is a little risk.

14:19.240 --> 14:23.200
Can you take the shade off that bulb? It
lifts straight up and off. Hand it to me.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.400
Thank you. Real light bulb?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.080
-Definitely, a real light bulb.
-Thank you so much.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.440
So I want you to take the bulb out now.
So turn it off first.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.120
Lovely. You can use your napkin.
If you pull... No, use your napkin

14:34.200 --> 14:36.040
-to grab it out of there.
-OK.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.120
And then... Yeah, it's a bayonet,
so push down, twist and then lift up.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.480
-OK.
-There you go! Perfect. Nicely done.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.240
Put the bulb on the napkin
in the middle of the table.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.840
And then, if it's not too hot to pick up,
can you pick it up and bang the glass

14:47.920 --> 14:49.800
a few times on the side of your plate
so they can all hear it's real?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.440
[plate dings]

14:51.520 --> 14:53.000
Even louder?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.960
-[light bulb smashes]
-[laughter]

14:55.040 --> 14:57.560
That's never happened before, but
maybe you don't eat that apple now.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.840
-It's real glass, yes?
-Yeah!

15:00.920 --> 15:04.520
Yes, I really thought that...
Normally, that can sustain quite a whack.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.160
Alright, great. So let's, erm...

15:07.240 --> 15:11.240
Can you put the broken bulb...

15:11.320 --> 15:12.760
[laughter]

15:12.840 --> 15:15.720
..inside the napkin for me, in there?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.640
And wrap that...
No, actually put it properly inside.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.720
Yeah. No, no, in...
If that makes sense, lovely.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.680
Wrap the whole thing up.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.840
Wrap it up and then smash it.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.360
OK. Thank you.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.320
Sarah, lovely. Being very careful to keep
the bits of broken glass in the middle,

15:36.400 --> 15:39.920
do you want to just slowly open this,
so we can see it on the table?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.240
Alright, fantastic.

15:44.320 --> 15:48.760
From an early age, we're conditioned
to find the sight of broken glass scary.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.520
Because we know we're not supposed
to touch it, cos it's dangerous.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.200
So I want you to touch it.
I want you to pick up a piece.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.800
You can go for one of these or for one
of the ones that broke on your plate.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.520
I don't mind, but maybe
not this massive, massive piece here.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.160
But, nonetheless, it doesn't
have to be a tiny piece either.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.240
Just pick up a piece, carefully. Alright.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.280
Now I want you to have
a proper look at this.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.880
I know you're not going to put it
in your mouth or shove it in your eye,

16:09.960 --> 16:12.920
but can you just bring it up close
and have a look at it like that.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.680
And I want you to verify for everybody
that that is real solid glass

16:17.760 --> 16:20.600
with solid sharp corners and edges?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.520
-Yeah, definitely.
-Yes, thank you.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.840
Now hold it in your left
hand for me, like that,

16:24.920 --> 16:27.280
and then slowly we're going
to take this piece of glass

16:27.360 --> 16:30.280
and hold it in front of my face.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.680
Now, Sarah, slowly
and carefully and steadily

16:41.760 --> 16:47.240
will you take that piece of glass now
and place it on my tongue?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.280
OK.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.840
At the moment, the sharp bit's...

16:59.840 --> 17:01.360
kind of pointing up...

17:03.200 --> 17:05.319
into my soft palate
and I'll try and turn it over,

17:05.400 --> 17:08.160
so they point down into my tongue.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.079
OK, that's no better. Alright.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.359
And then I'm going to try...

17:27.599 --> 17:29.000
to eat it.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.360
[crunching]

17:38.280 --> 17:39.480
[coughs]

17:45.360 --> 17:48.360
Now, if you think about this...
[coughs]

17:48.440 --> 17:51.440
the risk is obviously increasing.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.440
I've been doing this show about 350 times.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.920
[laughter]

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's going to go wrong at some point.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.960
I could cut myself quite badly.
There'd be a lawsuit against you,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.400
if I had to cancel the show,
for the loss of earnings.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.560
It's not like you signed
a waiver or anything.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.640
Sit forward for me.
Mind your elbows on this glass.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.200
I want you to, if you can, just sort of
rest yourself on the table a little bit.

18:13.280 --> 18:17.760
Now look, Sarah, it's very easy when
you're on stage to kind of slightly forget

18:17.840 --> 18:21.040
what you're doing or feel you have to
sort of play to an audience a little bit.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.440
I need you to really pay attention now
to what you are doing,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.400
in particular, that you follow
my instructions to the letter

18:27.480 --> 18:29.840
and that you don't jump
ahead at any point.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.160
Pick up a piece of apple.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.200
Right, bring your head forward,
open your mouth wide.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.600
Stick your tongue right out, right out.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.120
Don't tell yourself, "This is dangerous.
I'm gonna cut myself. This is awful."

18:54.200 --> 18:57.880
Tell yourself this is fine and then
take it in and close your mouth.

18:57.960 --> 19:02.400
I want you to move the glass between
your molars, your teeth at the side there.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.720
Alright, take your time with it. Keep your
mouth closed and then crunch into it.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.520
[crunching]

19:08.600 --> 19:11.440
Now, again, tell yourself this is fine,
take a bit of apple.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.320
Eat a bite of apple with it.
This is how I learned to do it.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.040
What happens is...
Take a big bite, big bite.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.320
The apple mops up
all the bits like chewing gum.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.680
Now, you can slowly start
to chew everything together.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.520
You're not going to let
a great big, sharp, shard of glass

19:24.600 --> 19:27.200
cut into your gums or cheek because
you can feel where everything is.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.800
If there is a sharp bit, you'll just
keep it flat, bring it back to your teeth

19:29.880 --> 19:31.960
and crunch it down more.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.200
So take your time. The apple soaks
everything up, mops everything up.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.800
You end up with a sort of sandy,
appley, kind of mulch.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.960
Don't swallow anything
at any point, right?

19:41.040 --> 19:43.000
Have another little bite of apple with it.

19:44.920 --> 19:49.720
Now, when you feel like all the big bits
have been crunched down

19:49.800 --> 19:51.960
and you can't feel any big bits anymore,

19:52.040 --> 19:54.520
you're going to take some water
and swill everything around.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.040
Again, you're not going to swallow.
I will, but I don't want you to.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.440
Just a swill round. So do that for me
when you feel the big bits are gone.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.200
OK, don't swallow yet.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.240
Now listen, it is safe to swallow as long
as you've crunched all the bits down.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.320
Alright? It's also safe
to be in your stomach

20:16.400 --> 20:19.240
because you took some apple first
and that lines your stomach.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.720
So as long as you've crunched
down all the big bits...

20:23.800 --> 20:26.360
-[laughter]
-As long as you've done that,

20:26.440 --> 20:30.200
don't tell yourself, "This is horrible,
this is dangerous, I'll cut myself."

20:30.280 --> 20:35.000
Tell yourself it's absolutely fine, I can
do it, and then swallow everything down.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.120
-All gone?
-Yep.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.160
All gone, amazing!
Sarah, well done. Stay right there.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.800
-[applause]
-Good!

20:51.920 --> 20:56.040
Congratulations. You're
the first person to do it. Well done.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.600
Well, it's just dangerous!

20:57.680 --> 21:00.280
Here we are,
take some water back with you.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.840
Now, can you fold all of this
back up into the middle?

21:03.920 --> 21:04.960
Yeah.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.920
And then drop the whole thing in here,
I want you to keep it.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.280
There you go.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.000
And I'll sign it to you.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.120
-It's Sarah with an "h", is it?
-Yes.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.680
Yep, OK.

21:20.760 --> 21:24.000
Two reasons why
I want you to have this.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.520
First, so you can spend the rest of your
life checking that was real glass we ate.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.480
But more importantly, the next time you're
faced with a worrying decision or a risk

21:33.560 --> 21:38.760
that you're fretting about, you can look
at this and remember you took a big risk.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.840
You ate a big chunk of glass
in front of 2,000 people.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.360
Nothing bad happened. You were fine.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.840
Now I don't know,
but I presume before doing it,

21:46.920 --> 21:50.160
you didn't imagine you would do something
like that in front of all these people.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.680
So, in some tiny way, that story
that you tell yourself about yourself

21:54.760 --> 21:58.160
has just changed and for the better.
So, congratulations.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.000
Take that and take the water as well.
Give us a kiss.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.160
You were lovely. Thank you so much.
Mind how you go. Straight down there.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.800
Sarah, everybody!

22:04.880 --> 22:07.400
[applause]

22:11.800 --> 22:13.920
This should go without saying
but I do have to say it,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.920
particularly as we're filming it tonight,
don't go home and start doing that.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.760
Alright? You do need someone
to talk you through it. OK.

22:19.840 --> 22:24.040
Let's get a guy up here. Let's say
a man aged between 18 and 30 for this.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.240
But don't come up if you're over six foot.
That's the limit. Somebody grab that.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.840
A guy between 18 and 30? Do you want to
get yourself to the bottom of the steps?

22:30.920 --> 22:33.640
Roll your sleeves up as you come up,
just roll your sleeves up a bit.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.520
-Bring yourself here. What's your name?
-Arthur.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.400
Arthur. Give Arthur a big hand.
Up he comes. Thank you.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.280
Hello. Up you come. Give me
that Frisbee, we'll get rid of that.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.480
Lovely. Come and stand over here,
about, sort of...

22:46.560 --> 22:49.520
There, Arthur, would be great.
Lovely. Just there. Turn and face me.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.960
Put your hands out like that. Thank you.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.560
So, Arthur, I'm going to give
you two 50p's. Lend you.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.160
<i>-Lend you two 50p's
-[laughter]</i>

22:58.240 --> 23:01.640
Alright, hands flat, please. I'm going to
try and grab one of these coins from you.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.040
Your only job is just to grab the coin
before I take it. Make sense?

23:05.120 --> 23:08.520
Now you can always do that more quickly
than it will take for me to grab it.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.520
So if you have a practice now,
of course, you can close your hand

23:10.600 --> 23:12.480
before I can grab it,
so this isn't about speed.

23:12.560 --> 23:16.000
Although I will do it quickly.
It's about manipulation.

23:16.080 --> 23:21.200
I am going to manipulate you each time
into letting me take the coin, alright?

23:21.280 --> 23:26.240
Also I will explain to you all, and you,
how I'm going to do it before I do it.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.440
So that you can take something
away and have a go at this yourself.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.000
So I normally do this five times.

23:32.080 --> 23:36.280
I think, looking at you now,
I'm going to try this six times.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.160
And we'll see. Yes, and we'll see.

23:38.240 --> 23:42.320
Alright, so hands flat.
The first technique will be misdirection.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.480
Misdirection, classic misdirection.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.640
Lower your hands a little bit.
You understand what we're doing?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.840
Great, then let's begin. One!

23:50.920 --> 23:53.600
So quick you forgot to applaud.
I understand.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.760
-Classic misdirection, erm...
-[applause]

23:56.840 --> 23:58.760
We practised with this one.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.880
I was looking at that one
and I went for the other one.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.200
Your attention's on the wrong side.
It's a very well-known technique.

24:04.280 --> 24:08.440
The second technique though is
not as well known. It's called an offbeat.

24:08.520 --> 24:12.240
Now do you know what an offbeat is?
It's that! It's a timing thing, alright?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.680
It's doing it in kind of an unexpected...
Thank you.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.760
An unexpected moment, an offbeat.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.960
Offbeat. There's another one.
Same thing, but we won't count it.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.880
That's an offbeat.
The third technique is conditioning.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.520
Conditioning, which essentially
means that by this point

24:26.600 --> 24:30.880
Arthur is so... [laughs]
..ready and poised and tense,

24:30.960 --> 24:34.200
waiting for me to take this coin that he
forgets about the one in the other hand.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.440
He's conditioned to expect it
to come from that hand.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.280
You're doing great by the way,
you're doing great.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.200
[laughter]

24:40.280 --> 24:42.320
OK, you're doing great.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.600
Just back a bit into your palm. Great.
So the next technique is compliance.

24:46.680 --> 24:49.880
I realise there's a whole bunch of stuff
you're trying to do at the same time here,

24:49.960 --> 24:54.240
making it complicated - trying to grab the
coin, second guessing which I'm going for.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.800
You're also trying to deal with the rising
aggression that I know you're feeling,

24:57.880 --> 25:01.240
which may explain the rash on your neck,
which you should probably get looked at.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.840
So would it be easier for you,
and I imagine it would be,

25:03.920 --> 25:06.600
if we got rid of one of the coins
in one of the hands?

25:06.680 --> 25:09.400
So you only had to worry about one coin
and one hand. It's got to be easier, yes?

25:09.480 --> 25:11.240
Yeah, great.
We'll get rid of that one then.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.280
That's four. That's classic compliance.
I nod my head, he nods his head.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.480
Suddenly, we're the best of friends
and you forget that you hate me

25:17.560 --> 25:21.320
and you're trying to protect the coin.
So that's compliance, coin number four.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.520
That's five.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.120
[laughter and applause]

25:25.200 --> 25:28.200
I don't know what that's called. You can
relax for a bit, drop your hands a bit.

25:28.280 --> 25:32.520
You're doing great, and don't
tell yourself you're going to fail.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.880
There's only one left.
Don't tell yourself you're going to fail.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.080
Again, that's just a story
we tell ourselves, isn't it?

25:37.160 --> 25:41.160
It's just a story and this idea
that those stories define us,

25:41.240 --> 25:44.080
in other words, that it isn't really
events that cause our problems,

25:44.160 --> 25:46.320
but more our reactions to them.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.680
This all goes back to a Roman
philosopher called Epictetus.

25:49.760 --> 25:54.960
2,000 years ago. And Epictetus also
gave us another great piece of advice,

25:55.040 --> 25:57.280
which I find helpful every day.

25:57.360 --> 26:01.240
Epictetus said there are things
in your life that you're in control of,

26:01.320 --> 26:05.480
and then there are things in your
life that you're not in control of.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.520
So if you stop trying
to control or change things

26:09.600 --> 26:11.680
that are not under your control anyway,

26:11.760 --> 26:16.560
you will remove a whole load of pointless
frustration and anxiety from your life.

26:16.640 --> 26:22.480
Right? He added to that, there are only
two things that you are in control of.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.640
Your thoughts and your actions.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.280
That's it. So everything else -

26:30.360 --> 26:33.200
what other people do, what they think,
what they think of you, how they behave -

26:33.280 --> 26:35.520
you can't control any of that, anyway.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.520
So if you stop trying to, if you stop
trying to fix it or change it in some way,

26:39.600 --> 26:44.120
if you just decide anything on
that side is fine and just let it go,

26:44.200 --> 26:46.320
nothing bad happens.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.600
You just feel better. You feel happier.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.960
You feel relief, like you've put down
a heavy case of bricks. It's good advice.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.560
This is how you can
win this on the last one.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.240
Bring your hand back out.
So just come... That's right.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.960
Come back to where you were,
hand back out for me.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.920
Do you remember at the beginning when you
weren't worrying about what I was doing,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.040
you had no problem doing it
before I could grab it?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.040
Now you're trying to second guess what I'm
doing and then, of course, it throws you.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.440
So forget what I'm doing, just
go back to what you're in control of.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.360
Your thoughts, your actions, your desire
just to keep hold of that coin.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.640
So I'm still going to try and get it,
of course, but, nonetheless,

27:16.720 --> 27:19.680
just focus on what you're in control of,
your desire to keep hold of that coin.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.960
When you do it, when you close hand,
keep your hand closed.

27:23.040 --> 27:26.200
Alright? Whatever happens just keep it
closed. Lower your hand a bit to there.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.560
That's fine. Take your
other hand out of your...

27:28.640 --> 27:32.480
Ooh! OK, that was so quick,
I've no idea if I got it or not.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.520
Can you tell without looking,
have you got it? Have you got it?

27:35.600 --> 27:37.240
-You have?
-Yeah.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.680
That would be really annoying on
the last one. Turn your hand over,

27:39.760 --> 27:41.560
so you don't look,
just turn it over like this, OK.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.120
I'm going to look at my hand first
because I think I can feel it.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.040
OK, I have got it. I have got the 50p.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.120
So I did take it. So if I've got the 50p,
what are you feeling?

27:50.200 --> 27:54.240
Turn your hand over
and then slowly open your fingers.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.600
That last time when I took the 50p out,

27:56.680 --> 28:00.400
I placed into your hand
a little commemorative coin.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.560
It says <i>"Derren Brown: Miracle"
on one side...</i>

28:03.640 --> 28:05.080
[laughter]

28:05.160 --> 28:08.160
And "thank you for taking part"
on the other!

28:08.240 --> 28:10.120
Thank you so much, Arthur.
You were fantastic.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.280
Thank you. You can sit yourself
back down. Arthur, everybody!

28:12.360 --> 28:14.600
[applause]

28:14.680 --> 28:17.600
Beautifully done. Thank you, Arthur.

28:24.160 --> 28:29.240
Thank you. So this urge to control things
that are not under our control,

28:29.320 --> 28:32.600
like the forces of life and the universe,

28:32.680 --> 28:36.720
lead to any number
of supernatural belief systems,

28:36.800 --> 28:41.080
as well as the billion dollar industries
that support them.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.280
Let's get a lady up here, please,
a lady.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.600
Thank you. Round of applause for this
lady. Thank you so much. Up you come.

28:47.680 --> 28:51.160
[applause]

28:51.240 --> 28:53.840
-Hi. What's your name?
-Sofia.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.840
Sofia, lovely to meet you. Up you come.
Let's get rid of that for you.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.440
You look lovely. Up you come.
So, Sofia, come and have a look at this.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.280
-I have six brown paper bags. See them?
-Yes.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.320
Yes? And then, if you follow me
round the back here,

29:07.400 --> 29:10.280
I also have a nail. This is
an eight-inch nail... Ooh, careful.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.000
-It's alright, I'll get it.
-Sorry.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.200
-It's OK.
-[laughter]

29:15.200 --> 29:17.960
It's clumsy, but endearing.
Never mind. Get round here.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.320
So, look, a solid eight-inch nail.
If you touch the end of that,

29:20.400 --> 29:22.120
-that's a proper nail, yes?
-Yes.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.240
So the bags all have
wooden blocks in them.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.800
If you show the camera, you'll see the
blocks are all the same size and shape,

29:27.880 --> 29:30.880
so to move the bags round,
they'd all feel the same. Thank you.

29:30.960 --> 29:35.360
They've got holes through them and through
this one I am going to place the nail.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.160
Now, Sofia, could you please -
and carefully now -

29:38.240 --> 29:40.880
because you have established
yourself as clumsy...

29:40.960 --> 29:44.320
-[laughter]
-With two million people watching on TV.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.920
Just with the palm of your hand,
could you do that for me?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.120
And just verify one last time,
that is a real solid, sharp nail, yes?

29:50.200 --> 29:52.000
-Yes, it is.
-Fantastic, thank you.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.960
So this goes in there.
Take a little step to the side for me.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.160
-It is Sofia, isn't it, not just Sophie?
-Sofia.

29:57.240 --> 30:01.760
So, Sofia, I'm going to mix this bag up
and I want you to lose track of which...

30:01.840 --> 30:04.920
of where it ends up, so face the other
way, close your eyes, so you can't see.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.160
I'll mix them all up.
I'll block your view as well,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.560
so, hopefully, you'll all lose
track of where the nail ends up.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.760
And as a little treat, in the audience,
you will get a quick glimpse there

30:13.840 --> 30:18.880
of my twin pert peaches
as the camera pans around.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.560
OK.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.840
OK, Sofia, you can turn
back round now and look.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.240
OK, you can't tell where
the nail is, can you?

30:28.320 --> 30:29.680
-No.
-No, perfect.

30:29.760 --> 30:33.000
Now you're going to mix them up
and, erm...

30:33.080 --> 30:34.960
And you're going to put them in a line.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.600
Give them a little mix and into
a line like this. So take your time.

30:37.680 --> 30:41.800
Mix them up and then into a line across
the table and then we'll all be set.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.560
[laughter]

30:59.920 --> 31:02.200
[laughter]

31:02.280 --> 31:04.800
Done? Oh, perfect.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.280
Beautifully done.
Thank you very much. Lovely.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.880
So, Sofia, I'm going to pass
my hands now over the bags

31:10.960 --> 31:14.200
and I'm going to try and randomise
this as much as possible,

31:14.280 --> 31:17.560
but whenever you want me to stop,
give me a very clear tap on the shoulder.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.800
And I will slam my hand down
on that bag that you chose.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.600
And we'll do this five times in a row,

31:24.680 --> 31:27.400
leaving one bag untouched.

31:27.480 --> 31:32.560
OK, so what I'm going to show you now
has been banned in 16 countries.

31:32.640 --> 31:36.800
And to give you an idea of why it's been
banned, I'm going to play you some clips.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.560
[laughter]

31:38.640 --> 31:42.760
Now in each of these clips it goes wrong
and it's variations on the same theme.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.760
It's often done with paper cups
instead of paper bags,

31:45.840 --> 31:49.920
but in each clip you'll see either the
performer or the person doing it with him

31:50.000 --> 31:51.880
gets a nail through their hand.

31:51.960 --> 31:55.120
I can't watch this, but please enjoy.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.680
[laughter]

32:00.600 --> 32:02.480
[audience groans]

32:26.160 --> 32:28.240
[audience groans]

32:30.200 --> 32:32.640
Needless to say,
I feel nothing but confidence.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.800
[laughter]

32:34.880 --> 32:38.080
Playing with a lady who has already
established herself as a clumsy cow.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.040
[laughter]

32:42.360 --> 32:46.160
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.200
He maketh me
lie down in green pastures.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.760
He leadeth me by still waters.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.960
He restoreth my soul.

32:56.520 --> 33:01.120
And he leadeth me
in the path of righteousness

33:01.200 --> 33:03.280
in his name.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.720
And, yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of <i>death,</i>

33:08.800 --> 33:11.280
yet I will fear no evil,

33:11.360 --> 33:13.160
for thou art with me.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.880
Thy rod and staff comfort me.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.880
[audience gasps]

33:22.960 --> 33:24.440
[laughter]

33:29.200 --> 33:32.640
Thou preparest a table
before mine enemies.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.520
Ooh!

33:38.520 --> 33:40.040
[audience gasps]

33:43.200 --> 33:46.480
Thou anointest my head with oil.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.200
[audience gasps]

33:55.640 --> 33:57.920
My cup runneth over.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.240
[audience gasps]

34:06.200 --> 34:08.000
It's one of those two.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.600
[laughter]

34:15.840 --> 34:18.360
Surely goodness...

34:18.440 --> 34:21.679
[laughter]

34:25.000 --> 34:26.520
We'll do that again.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.159
[laughter]

34:28.239 --> 34:32.040
Surely goodness and mercy

34:32.120 --> 34:34.320
will follow me,

34:34.400 --> 34:37.600
all the days of my life.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.960
[laughter]

34:45.159 --> 34:47.600
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.080
-Well done!
-["Hallelujah Chorus" plays]

34:50.159 --> 34:53.520
Take a little step to the side
just there for me.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.320
You were amazing!
Come here. Congratulations.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.400
You were absolutely fantastic,
Thank you so much. Mind how you go.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.560
Sofia, everybody.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.440
Thank fuck for that.

35:12.040 --> 35:16.120
So I first saw that stunt
performed in a church in America

35:16.200 --> 35:18.760
as a dangerous demonstration of the...

35:18.840 --> 35:20.640
Followed by another
dangerous demonstration,

35:20.720 --> 35:24.560
which the pastor called
"private court blender".

35:24.640 --> 35:27.040
[laughter]

35:27.120 --> 35:30.400
Or whatever that person
wrote for their brain fart.

35:30.480 --> 35:36.240
A dangerous demonstration of the power of
the Holy Spirit to protect his minister.

35:36.320 --> 35:40.760
And, when I saw it, exactly the same thing
happened that happened tonight with Sofia.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.960
The lady that mixed it and, obviously,
like Sofia, could have mixed the nail

35:44.040 --> 35:46.960
into any one of those positions, right?
Could have ended up anywhere in the line.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.680
But it also happened to be in
the third bag along when she did it.

35:49.760 --> 35:54.840
The fact that it was in, like, bag number
three was taken as further evidence,

35:54.920 --> 35:58.040
further proof, of the Holy Spirit at work

35:58.120 --> 36:00.840
because bag number three
represents the Holy Trinity.

36:00.920 --> 36:05.560
Father, Son, Holy Ghost, bag number
three. Explain that, Richard Dawkins!

36:08.040 --> 36:11.920
I discovered this minister when
I was researching for a TV show

36:12.000 --> 36:15.360
that I made, called <i>Miracles For Sale,</i>

36:15.440 --> 36:18.720
which some of you may have seen.
None of you here tonight?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.080
But some people somewhere may have seen.

36:21.160 --> 36:25.200
That programme went out
on Channel 4 in 2011,

36:25.280 --> 36:31.200
and it looked at the eccentric world
of evangelical faith healing.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.440
Now, I'm quite an outspoken atheist.

36:34.520 --> 36:37.560
As far as I'm concerned, it's all
a big scam at the expense of the Church,

36:37.640 --> 36:39.840
but when you put all that to one side,

36:39.920 --> 36:43.040
a couple of things still really surprised
me about these events when I went to them.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.560
First of all, when you go,
you see things that are extraordinary

36:47.640 --> 36:51.160
and you wouldn't see them on any
other stage anywhere in the world.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.400
And secondly,

36:54.480 --> 36:56.960
for plenty of people there,
they are going through

36:57.040 --> 37:01.520
a genuinely transformative,
even life-changing experience.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.560
So...

37:04.640 --> 37:06.080
[laughter]

37:06.160 --> 37:08.600
Without selling you a belief system

37:08.680 --> 37:11.080
and without pretending I can cure cancer,

37:11.160 --> 37:15.280
I think I can give you
that experience tonight,

37:15.360 --> 37:17.440
and heal you.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.280
Stand up.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.360
Up you get. Everybody up, up, up, up!
Feet flat on the floor. Stand up.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.080
-[fanfare plays]
-OK.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.960
So we're playing some cheesy music
to make you smile.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.600
Everybody make a picture
of an ideal version of yourself,

37:35.680 --> 37:39.960
everything you want to be, and make it
so the picture makes you feel amazing

37:40.040 --> 37:42.800
and notice how good it feels. OK.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.920
Good. And now do this.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.040
Imagine somebody takes
that picture and they pull it back.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.920
They stretch it back, like it's
on a catapult aimed right at you.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.520
You ready? Release!

37:55.600 --> 37:58.480
And as it blasts through you,
breathe that feeling

37:58.560 --> 38:01.240
back through the whole of your body.
Now do this...

38:01.320 --> 38:03.640
Picture something that
normally makes you feel bad.

38:03.720 --> 38:09.000
It's like your brain goes, "No, not that!
This!" and it releases again.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.400
And your brain is now releasing opioids

38:12.480 --> 38:17.320
and adrenaline is coursing through
your veins, and they remove pain.

38:17.400 --> 38:21.720
They remove the experience of pain,
so if you had pain in your body,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.840
notice now that it has gone.

38:24.920 --> 38:28.280
If something has changed, if the pain's
gone, I just want to find out what it is.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.920
So come out from your rows
and just walk around.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.960
Get yourself up against that line there.
I want to find out what has happened.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.000
What has changed. If it was
round your head, neck, shoulders,

38:38.080 --> 38:41.280
then move your head from side to side, or
your shoulders, whatever you need to do.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.640
Check the pain's gone and you've got
more movement. Maybe down your back.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.560
Maybe pains you've had in your stomach
all your life that have now just gone.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.760
Just come and line up against there.
If you're upstairs, thank you so much.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.600
Notice how much easier
the stairs are now.

38:54.680 --> 38:59.080
Come and join these people. This is your
one chance, you will be pleased you did.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.920
Come and line up, come and join
these people at the side.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.440
We've got a long, long line of people.
I think more than I've had before.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.560
It goes right up the side
of the stalls here

39:08.640 --> 39:12.560
and it goes along the back to
what looks like about halfway along.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.440
It's a bit difficult to see. We've got
a long, long line of people. Alright.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.800
[music stops]

39:16.880 --> 39:20.080
So up until this point I've been
using psychological techniques,

39:20.160 --> 39:22.760
secular techniques,
to get you into this state.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.680
From now on,

39:24.760 --> 39:28.960
I'm going to use the language and
the trappings of the evangelical world

39:29.040 --> 39:31.280
to make this work.

39:31.360 --> 39:35.120
This will be a little odd at times,
might even feel a little uncomfortable,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.160
but bear this in mind
because it's important.

39:37.240 --> 39:41.720
Everything I'm going to show you now
between now and the end of the show,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.960
I have <i> seen.</i>

39:44.040 --> 39:49.400
I've seen on these stages around the world
performed by pastors and preachers

39:49.480 --> 39:54.680
as powerful proof
of the healing light of God.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.000
So let's begin.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.920
[whispers] And bring this healing into
this room and these people here tonight.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.280
Show them, Lord. Thank you for...

40:10.360 --> 40:13.200
[indistinct whispering]
Amen. Thank you.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.480
Alright, I want to talk to
someone who's had a healing.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.160
So the first person come up.
Just come up here.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.480
Hello. Thanks for being brave.
What's your name?

40:20.560 --> 40:21.560
Gerty.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.840
Gerty. Come and stand here, Gerty.
Come and face me.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.360
Tell us in your own words
what's happened.

40:26.440 --> 40:30.640
-I broke my back a year and a half ago.
-OK.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.800
So you've had a year and a half
of pain and discomfort there?

40:32.880 --> 40:34.920
-Yeah, quite a lot.
-What's happened tonight?

40:35.000 --> 40:40.040
Yeah, I guess it just...
Standing up felt pretty breezy.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.360
-Is there a sense of flexibility?
-Yeah.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.880
-Feel pretty good.
-Yeah. See, this is a real thing.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.560
Feet together, look at me.

40:46.640 --> 40:50.920
Jeremiah 33:6, the Lord said, "Behold,
I will give them healing and cure.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.200
I will cure them and I will reveal to them
an abundance of peace and truth."

40:56.280 --> 41:00.920
And, Gerty, I want you to let
that abundance of peace and truth

41:01.000 --> 41:03.760
heal you now! Let it take you
back like a golden light

41:03.840 --> 41:06.400
and spread through you,
bringing its release

41:06.480 --> 41:08.440
and its relief wherever you need it.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.840
We thank you, Lord,
for your healing power here tonight.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.000
Let it move and spread through you, Gerty.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.440
Enjoy it as it brings
its softening and its relief.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.200
You can come back to us.
Let's bring her back. Take a moment.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.680
Up you come. Now this
has got to feel good, hasn't it?

41:21.760 --> 41:25.120
How does that feel? That's got to feel
a lot different, hasn't it, in your back?

41:25.200 --> 41:28.720
That was actually very different
to how I normally feel standing up.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.560
-Yeah, it's...
-It's amazing, isn't it?

41:30.640 --> 41:34.320
You can sit yourself down there. Let's
give the Lord a mighty hand of praise!

41:34.400 --> 41:38.880
And I want to...
I want to hear mighty handfuls of coins

41:38.960 --> 41:42.440
dropping into those collection buckets
as we pass them around.

41:42.520 --> 41:46.640
I'll show you something I saw performed
by a pastor in Fort Worth, near Dallas.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.200
We filmed with hidden cameras and he took
someone like Gerty, that he'd never met.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.280
Could tell her where the healing
was happening. It was extraordinary.

41:53.360 --> 41:57.240
He didn't need to ask. It was as if
the Lord was just showing him a light

41:57.320 --> 41:59.360
on their body where
the healing was happening.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.120
So somebody else get up here, but don't
tell me, don't give me any indication.

42:02.200 --> 42:05.520
Stand here for me. Don't let me know
where the healing is. What's your name?

42:05.600 --> 42:07.040
-Again?
-Shannon.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.880
Shannon. Stand right opposite me here,
Shannon. Again, we don't know each other?

42:09.960 --> 42:11.400
-No.
-No. Unlike a lot of these healers,

42:11.480 --> 42:14.840
I don't use stooges or plants. Also,
Shannon, not that it would help me anyway,

42:14.920 --> 42:19.280
but could you check that there's no kind
of earpiece or anything in there

42:19.360 --> 42:21.120
-that could feed me any information.
-No.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.800
-Nothing there either?
-No.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.840
Also I'm looking at you.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.920
I'm not trying to sort of read
your signals or anything like that.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.520
This is... the Lord now showing me.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.400
(whispering) Thank you, Father.
It's Shannon here tonight.

42:38.480 --> 42:41.040
[indistinct whispering]

42:50.840 --> 42:52.800
It's your right knee.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.960
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.400
[laughter]

42:57.480 --> 43:01.600
There's a light there. There's a physical
shift that's happened in the knee.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.480
-It dislocates, doesn't it, normally?
-Yeah.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.120
-Oh, God.
-[laughter]

43:06.200 --> 43:09.800
And you've had this for years? This isn't
just... For, like, years you've had this?

43:09.880 --> 43:12.720
So you tell us, what's happened? What's
happened now? What's the difference?

43:12.800 --> 43:14.480
I don't... I...

43:14.560 --> 43:17.280
It's hard. My knee dislocates a lot

43:17.360 --> 43:20.120
and yesterday I banged it on the Tube
and it was really sore.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.440
And I complained to my mum about it
and it doesn't feel sore anymore,

43:23.520 --> 43:25.800
-but it did when I came in.
-Yeah, I can imagine.

43:25.880 --> 43:28.640
Is there some movement? Just show us
something that normally would hurt.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.280
-That you wouldn't be able to do.
-Yeah.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.360
-So there's no pain now doing that?
-No, no.

43:32.440 --> 43:35.400
This is a wonderful thing. This is
a real thing. And, Shannon, take this now

43:35.480 --> 43:39.480
and let that move and spread through you
and bring its release as you need it.

43:39.560 --> 43:42.480
Release and relief through the whole
of your body. We thank you, Father.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.160
We give you the glory,
we give you the praise.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.560
We thank you, Lord, for your
healing energy here tonight.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.360
We thank you, Father,
we thank you, Lord.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.280
She's got a look of
absolute bliss on her face.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.640
I wish you could all feel
how good this feels as it moves

43:54.720 --> 43:57.760
and spreads through you, Shannon. Let
it spread through the whole of your body.

43:57.840 --> 44:03.040
Let's bring her back. Up you come.
Take a moment. I've got you. Up you come.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.800
-How's it feeling?
-It's so weird.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.400
-It is weird, isn't it?
-Yeah.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.760
What's it like at the moment? Is there
any feeling? Like a numbness or a...

44:08.840 --> 44:10.960
-No.
-Or a tingling or..?

44:11.040 --> 44:14.680
It feels stronger than my other knee now.
It feels really strange.

44:14.760 --> 44:17.400
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Why don't you sit yourself down there?

44:17.480 --> 44:19.640
Someone say, "Hallelujah for the Lord!"

44:19.720 --> 44:23.160
And I want to see notes now
drift into those buckets.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.240
No measly coins.
Just 20's and 50's for the Lord.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.520
Get yourself up here, sir.
Oh, look at this!

44:28.600 --> 44:32.360
You've got a golden light around you.
You're surrounded with a light.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.680
You are surrounded with a light. This is
a powerful healing. Come and stand here.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.360
-Your name?
-Sam.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.080
-Again, we don't know each other, Sam?
-No.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.920
Thank you, Father.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.480
-The healing's here, in your chest.
-Yeah.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.720
-Yeah.
-You've had maybe two, three weeks

44:47.800 --> 44:50.440
of pain here and restriction,
a kind of a tightness.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.360
-Yeah.
-What's it like now?

44:52.440 --> 44:55.000
Er, butterflies instead.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.680
-Butterflies? Tingling.
-Yeah. Yeah.

44:56.760 --> 44:59.080
It's what I was mentioning there.
And you can... [sniffs]

44:59.160 --> 45:01.560
When you breathe it's different, isn't it?
I can see it, there's a whole...

45:01.640 --> 45:04.720
-It's not restrictive.
-Yeah, take a full breath for us.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.800
So how long have you not been
able to do that for, a few weeks?

45:07.880 --> 45:10.040
-About two weeks.
- Do you know what it is, what caused it?

45:10.120 --> 45:13.200
-It was a viral infection in my heart.
-OK. And now?

45:13.280 --> 45:14.560
Now...

45:15.720 --> 45:18.040
-It's... good as new.
-Wonderful.

45:18.120 --> 45:22.080
But there's more happening here,
because you are surrounded with a light.

45:22.160 --> 45:25.800
Let me get the case out for Sam.
Stay right there. Alright, so many of you

45:25.880 --> 45:29.160
have come down. We've got a line all
the way along the back and round there

45:29.240 --> 45:31.880
to about halfway along
the back of the stalls.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.880
More than have ever come down.
I would love to have you all up here

45:34.960 --> 45:37.640
and hear from you your testimonies
as to what has been healed.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.040
I'm not going to have enough time. I may
be able to talk to three more people.

45:40.120 --> 45:42.760
But thank you so much, particularly if
you came all the way down from the top.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.120
But I'm going to ask the rest of you
now to go and take your seats

45:45.200 --> 45:47.840
and comfortably watch the rest of the
show. Please give him a huge hand.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.520
Thank you so much, thank you
so much for making the effort.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.920
But you three, I'll get you up here.
Up you come.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.240
Thank you so much. Hello. So
you see those three seats over there?

45:58.320 --> 46:00.360
Alright? Do you want
to take the seat on the left?

46:00.440 --> 46:03.760
So, the one on the left. If you go in the
one on the middle. Hi. What's your name?

46:03.840 --> 46:06.440
-Morgan.
-Morgan, what's changed?

46:06.520 --> 46:09.560
So when I was younger I had
a riding accident and I fractured my neck,

46:09.640 --> 46:13.360
and so since, on and off, I've had
quite a bit of pain for a number of years.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.640
So, not just a bit of strain at work,
this is like a proper thing?

46:15.720 --> 46:18.720
-No. I've had it for a number of years.
-So you've got more movement?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.640
-Mm.
-It's a wonderful thing. Thank you.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.200
-And what's your name?
-Natalie.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.000
-Natalie, what's happened?
-I broke my ribs in July.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.640
And if I take a deep breath
or bend over too much,

46:28.720 --> 46:31.080
they really hurt, and now
they're just kind of...

46:31.160 --> 46:34.160
-Take a breath. No pain?
-No pain.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.880
Sam, come round here for me.
You're going to try and lift this case.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.240
So try and stand over it.
Put one leg over it, face me.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.000
So you're straddling it and take hold of
the handle. Maybe take a little step back.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.640
Now listen, it's very heavy,
so keep your back straight,

46:45.720 --> 46:47.960
bend your legs, just try and
lift it straight up. Yeah, go on.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.480
No, it's not going anywhere.

46:51.560 --> 46:54.400
OK, you may think later on
I'm not really giving him a chance.

46:54.480 --> 46:57.760
I am going to give you another chance,
Sam. Put everything you can into it.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.440
No?

47:00.520 --> 47:03.240
No? OK. The devil
has taken away his strength.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.200
That and the fact
if you look, Sam, you will see...

47:07.600 --> 47:10.080
Full of bricks.
No one's ever been able to lift it.

47:10.160 --> 47:13.400
So don't worry, no shame in that.
If you haven't held one brick for a while,

47:13.480 --> 47:15.880
they are surprisingly heavy, alright? OK.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.600
So, look...

47:17.680 --> 47:21.920
Sam, take that, face the front,
close your eyes and accept this now.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.240
Lord, you are our song,
our strength and our salvation.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.560
You give courage to the weary,
you give strength to the weak.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.720
This healing that you've
started in Sam's chest,

47:31.800 --> 47:34.040
let it now move and spread
and expand through him

47:34.120 --> 47:36.200
as a powerful new strength.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.600
Breathe it through you, Sam.

47:38.680 --> 47:41.360
Feel it expanding across
your chest and your shoulders.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.800
This is a mighty strength.
This is the Lord's holy might,

47:44.880 --> 47:48.920
bringing its release and its power
through the whole of your body.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.080
Feel it down your spine, down your legs to
your feet, down your arms to your hands.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.720
Breathe it through you as it expands
across your chest and your shoulders.

47:56.800 --> 48:01.640
This is the Lord's holy might, enjoy it.
Open your eyes. How does it feel?

48:01.720 --> 48:03.720
-Refreshing.
-It's good, isn't it?

48:03.800 --> 48:06.200
Bring yourself back to where
you were and take hold of that handle.

48:06.280 --> 48:08.840
Now don't try and lift it,
just take hold of the handle.

48:08.920 --> 48:11.120
Everybody else, start a slow hand clap.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.440
-[audience clap]
-OK, now look at me, Sam.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.880
I only want you to try
and lift it an inch, alright?

48:16.960 --> 48:20.560
Slowly. Just enough. Now keep
your back straight, bend your legs.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.160
Just an inch, go slowly, slowly, go on!

48:23.240 --> 48:25.960
Good. Now can you bring it to me?
Bring it to me, Sam.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.800
Bring it to me, bring it to me, bring it
to me! Amazing! Bring it to me.

48:28.880 --> 48:31.200
Bring it to me, bring it to me,
bring it to me! Drop it down!

48:31.280 --> 48:33.880
Hallelujah, Sam! Congratulations!

48:33.960 --> 48:37.720
Sit yourself down there. Let's give
the Lord a mighty hand of praise!

48:37.800 --> 48:42.400
I want to hear your hands reach in and
pull out your credit cards for the Lord.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.280
Don't forget to fill out your
expiration dates on those forms.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.600
[laughter]

48:52.680 --> 48:55.440
Someone's tinnitus has just gone.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.240
Someone had tinnitus
and it has just been healed.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.880
You need to check and then let me
know where you are.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.920
Stick your hand up, and if I can't
see you, can people point you out?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.720
Someone's tinnitus has just gone.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.240
Yeah, up here.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.320
I'm so sorry. Ah, right up there! Sorry.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.240
How long had you had it for?

49:10.320 --> 49:11.920
About ten or 12 years.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.920
Ten or 12 years?
You know what tinnitus is, yes?

49:15.000 --> 49:18.600
That persistent ringing in the ear. It's a
horrible thing, and you've checked it?

49:18.680 --> 49:21.480
-And it's gone?
-It's gone.

49:21.560 --> 49:26.080
It's gone. Ten, 12 years of tinnitus
gone, up there on the balcony.

49:26.160 --> 49:28.400
-[applause]
-There are further lights.

49:28.480 --> 49:30.280
We thank you, Father.
We thank you, Lord.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.400
We give him the glory,
we give him the praise.

49:32.480 --> 49:36.000
There are further lights down here.
There are lights of healing.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.680
Let's go out, let's go out.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.840
Here.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.880
There's a light of healing here.
I don't know if it's that lady there.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.720
It's sort of around here somewhere.
Father, show me.

49:55.880 --> 49:58.880
Show me, Lord. Give me... Who's...?
Give me a name, Lord, or something.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.120
Kim? Is there a Kim?

50:02.200 --> 50:04.080
-It is you? It is you?
-Yes.

50:04.160 --> 50:06.840
Bring yourself out.
Come out here for me, Kim.

50:09.480 --> 50:13.360
OK, just bring yourself up here, Kim.
Thank you. Just turn and face that way.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.560
-We don't know each other, do we?
-No.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.520
No. I don't know why
I've been brought to you.

50:17.600 --> 50:20.480
I'm going to ask the Lord why he's
brought me to you, where this healing is.

50:20.560 --> 50:24.520
Thank you, Father. Show me, Lord,
where this healing is happening.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.720
And, Kim, it's...

50:26.800 --> 50:29.240
Thank you, Lord. You tell me
if the Lord is telling me right.

50:29.320 --> 50:31.640
-It's around your neck and your shoulders.
-Yeah.

50:31.720 --> 50:35.520
Yeah. How long had you had the pain for?
It's been very stiff and very tense.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.560
Yeah, since I started in
an office job, about six years ago.

50:38.640 --> 50:41.600
Six years?
And right now, how's it feeling?

50:41.680 --> 50:45.080
It just feels different.
I used to feel like it was squished up

50:45.160 --> 50:47.480
and now it feels soft. It's weird.

50:47.560 --> 50:50.200
It is weird, isn't it?
It's a wonderful thing.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.880
Feet together. Face the front for me.
Thank you, Kim.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.760
We're going to continue this healing now.
Father, heal Kim!

50:55.840 --> 50:59.200
And I've got you, as this moves through
you and spreads through you like a light,

50:59.280 --> 51:03.480
bringing this release and relief as it
starts in your neck and your shoulders,

51:03.560 --> 51:05.880
and continues to move
and bring its release,

51:05.960 --> 51:08.360
and spread through your body.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.360
It's a wonderful thing.

51:10.440 --> 51:13.520
There's a healing here.
There's a light here.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.000
Er...

51:15.080 --> 51:18.320
Lucia? Lucia, is this you?

51:18.400 --> 51:20.400
Up you get, up you get.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.640
[he speaks in tongues]
This is the gift of tongues!

51:23.720 --> 51:26.040
I'm being given your healing in tongues.

51:26.120 --> 51:29.120
The Lord said, to all those who believe,
he would give the power to cast out demons

51:29.200 --> 51:32.200
and the power to talk in tongues.
He also said in the Book of Corinthians,

51:32.280 --> 51:35.120
one person will always interpret
those tongues. It's you! Come here.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.760
-What's your name?
-Donna.

51:36.840 --> 51:40.320
Donna, come round here. I don't
want Lucia seeing what you're doing.

51:40.400 --> 51:44.200
Just come and stand sort of somewhere
there for me. OK, alright. Yes or no?

51:44.280 --> 51:46.440
-Do you have the Gift of Isaiah?
-No.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.240
-No? Do you know what it is?
-No.

51:48.320 --> 51:51.080
Then how do you know you
haven't got it? I give it to you now.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.400
Close your eyes and accept this.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.840
Father, bestow upon Donna
the Gift of Isaiah.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.400
It's the gift of interpretation.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.840
The Lord will reveal to you
the meaning of these tongues.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.920
[he speaks in tongues]
The Lord will reveal this to you.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.480
I'm going to give you a pen and paper.

52:08.560 --> 52:12.800
Open your eyes for me. I'm going to give
you... I don't want Lucia seeing this.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.800
So if you take the pen and paper.
It's a crappy bit of paper. Forgive me.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.400
You're just going to do, like that,
just like lines and squiggles,

52:17.480 --> 52:19.680
and whorls all over the paper,
you can cover the whole thing,

52:19.760 --> 52:23.160
but let your hand be guided, let the Lord
guide you, feel your hand being guided.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.360
Then let's just have a look at this.
We'll see how the Lord is guiding her.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.600
Stop now. Let's let the camera see.

52:31.680 --> 52:36.200
Move the pen away. OK, is that...
Does that mean anything to you?

52:36.280 --> 52:38.360
-No.
-No. OK, that's... Yeah, understandably.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.160
[laughter]

52:40.240 --> 52:43.600
Why don't you go and take the paper? I'm
not going to touch it. It will something.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.880
It will mean something because
the Lord has guided her hand.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.640
The Lord said not to touch the paper,
so I won't touch it. You take that.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.240
Let's get it up on stage and have a look.
Donna, I'll take the pen back from you.

52:52.320 --> 52:54.360
The Lord said they're not cheap,
so thank you.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.000
Up you go, Lucia.
We'll have a look at this.

52:56.080 --> 52:57.720
Thank you so much, Donna.
Take a seat, that's great.

52:57.800 --> 53:02.160
We'll have a look at this on stage,
under the Lord's holy light.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.960
Father, show us the meaning of this.
This means nothing to you, you're saying?

53:13.040 --> 53:15.520
-No.
-Show us, Lord, what this means.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.480
Show us why you guided
Donna's hand in this way?

53:18.560 --> 53:23.160
The reason why I think this is garbled is
there's more than one healing happening.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.960
There are several healings
around your back, correct?

53:26.040 --> 53:27.080
Yes.

53:27.160 --> 53:30.080
There's a trapped nerve in the base
of your back that causes you pain?

53:30.160 --> 53:31.440
Yes.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.400
I think there's a healing for somebody
else here as well and I think that's why

53:34.480 --> 53:37.800
this is so garbled. Anyone you're close
to you would hope would have a healing?

53:37.880 --> 53:40.080
-Yes, my partner, Chris.
-Your partner, Chris?

53:40.160 --> 53:43.120
Can I ask what's wrong with Chris or what
part of him, or what his condition is?

53:43.200 --> 53:45.400
-Yeah, he had a hernia.
-OK.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.840
I think there may be some relief
for Chris here and his hernia.

53:48.920 --> 53:52.880
Lord, show us if there is
relief here for Chris too.

53:52.960 --> 53:57.000
Show us a sign.
Thank you, Father. Look at this.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.120
[Lucia] Oh, my God.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.840
The Lord is raining his blessings
down upon Chris now.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.800
Take this to Chris. He'll be feeling
the Lord's relief right now.

54:09.880 --> 54:13.040
Take that to him.
Thank you, Lucia, you can sit down.

54:13.120 --> 54:17.520
We are standing on holy ground tonight,
ladies and gentlemen!

54:17.600 --> 54:19.960
We are standing on holy ground!

54:20.040 --> 54:22.480
And one of you here,

54:22.560 --> 54:25.040
one of you is to receive an anointing,

54:25.120 --> 54:28.400
a powerful anointing... from the Lord.

54:28.480 --> 54:31.680
No, somebody's eyesight is being healed.
Wait one second, let's go out.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.360
Anybody get a programme?
I'll grab that. Thank you so much.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.800
One of you is being...

54:35.880 --> 54:39.160
Ah! Your healing is complete.
You can get up. Up you come, Kim.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.880
-[laughter]
-Kim, how is it? Are you feeling?

54:41.960 --> 54:44.000
-Sleepy.
-Sleepy, but it's good, yeah?

54:44.080 --> 54:47.360
All the pain gone? Wonderful, sit
yourself back down. Thank you so much.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.760
Somebody's eyesight
is being healed here.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.560
OK, I want to get this right.

54:53.640 --> 54:54.840
Ah!

54:55.920 --> 54:58.760
Come out here. Here it is.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.400
I was looking on the wrong side.
Come here for me. What's your name?

55:01.480 --> 55:04.280
-Danielle.
-Come and stand here for me, Danielle.

55:04.360 --> 55:09.560
Come and stand there. Take your glasses
off for me. Thank you. Let's have a look.

55:09.640 --> 55:12.600
Wow! The Lord has his work
cut out tonight, alright.

55:12.680 --> 55:15.840
Could you hold Danielle's glasses for me?
Thank you, sir, be careful with them.

55:15.920 --> 55:19.960
Grab the mic for me, Danielle. So, if
you've got a brochure, turn to page...

55:21.440 --> 55:24.280
Four. That's quite a good one.
There's lots of little writing on it.

55:24.360 --> 55:28.200
It's the little writing we'll look at.
If you have a brochure turn to page four.

55:28.280 --> 55:32.000
Can you, yes or no... Can you read
the small writing without your glasses on?

55:32.080 --> 55:34.320
-No.
-Can you read this paragraph any clearer?

55:34.400 --> 55:36.680
-No.
-No, I don't imagine you could. OK.

55:36.760 --> 55:39.920
Take the brochure as well. Look at me.
Your name again, Danielle?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.720
Danielle, we're going to heal your eyes.
Do you believe in God?

55:42.800 --> 55:45.560
-I do.
-You do? You ever had any real proof?

55:45.640 --> 55:47.240
-No.
-No? OK.

55:47.320 --> 55:50.920
Well, going to give you proof now.
Close your eyes and accept this.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.680
Lord, heal Danielle's eyes.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.480
It's happening now. So, the optic nerve
is being repaired on both sides,

56:01.560 --> 56:04.120
but there is more damage
on the left than the right.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.000
And that smile confirms
that Danielle knows that too.

56:07.080 --> 56:11.800
There's quite a lot of damage
that's just being undone right now.

56:11.880 --> 56:15.160
Satan take your hands off this woman!
I command the devil of blindness

56:15.240 --> 56:18.760
to leave Danielle's body
in the Lord's holy name!

56:20.320 --> 56:23.400
And it just finished.
You can open your eyes.

56:23.480 --> 56:27.000
Let's have a look. Thank you.
Does it look any clearer to you?

56:27.080 --> 56:29.760
Fuck me sideways!

56:29.840 --> 56:32.600
[laughter and applause]

56:35.960 --> 56:37.000
So...

56:39.400 --> 56:41.840
I take it there's a clear improvement?

56:41.920 --> 56:43.440
[laughter]

56:43.520 --> 56:46.160
Can you.. You couldn't...
Can you read any of these words now?

56:46.240 --> 56:49.600
"Many hotel soaps are so small they may

56:49.680 --> 56:52.800
mysteriously vanish
during the act of showering."

56:52.880 --> 56:55.320
Effortless. And this paragraph
here you couldn't read either.

56:55.400 --> 57:00.040
"Remembering to come back and turn off
the shower if you've been out for a walk."

57:00.120 --> 57:03.680
This is effortless. Your eyesight is
healed. You don't need these anymore.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.440
You can throw those glasses away.
Danielle, congratulations!

57:06.520 --> 57:10.840
It's a miracle, ladies and gentlemen!
Her eyesight is healed!

57:10.920 --> 57:12.760
Wait. Wait!

57:14.520 --> 57:17.160
Wait. One of you is sceptical.

57:17.240 --> 57:19.440
[laughter]

57:19.520 --> 57:21.400
One of you is... It's you!

57:21.480 --> 57:23.600
-What's your name?
-Andre.

57:23.680 --> 57:26.160
Andre, you don't really believe the Lord
just healed Danielle's eyes, do you?

57:26.240 --> 57:28.760
-Not really, no.
-We have a doubting Thomas in our midst,

57:28.840 --> 57:33.000
ladies and gentlemen. The Lord
has a powerful lesson for Andre tonight,

57:33.080 --> 57:36.320
about faith and belief.
Get yourself up here, Andre.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.160
You've seen, alright, this...

57:42.240 --> 57:45.640
this lady here with a year and a half
of pain across her back,

57:45.720 --> 57:48.800
and just cured, just suddenly healed.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.760
And this lady here, with your knee,
wasn't it? And still you don't believe.

57:51.840 --> 57:56.280
I took from Danielle the devil of
blindness and, Andre, I put it in you now.

57:56.360 --> 58:00.400
-[laughter]
-The Lord removes your ability to read,

58:00.480 --> 58:05.840
just for long enough to teach you
a powerful lesson about faith and belief.

58:07.320 --> 58:09.800
The devil resides in you
until I release it again.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.600
It's done. Open your eyes.
Do you feel any different?

58:13.680 --> 58:16.480
-No.
-Do you feel like you can still read?

58:16.560 --> 58:18.760
-Perfectly, yeah.
- Great, well, we'll have a look.

58:18.840 --> 58:22.400
Face the front, thank you. So if you've
got a brochure, let's go to page...

58:22.480 --> 58:25.080
page six, there you go.

58:25.160 --> 58:27.520
So now, look, big writing
on page six, right?

58:27.600 --> 58:29.520
So hopefully more of you can
see that there? Can you see that?

58:29.600 --> 58:32.760
You can make sense of that there, yes?
And you can see it there too, yes?

58:32.840 --> 58:35.520
Can you put your thumbs up
if you can read that? Alright, great.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.960
We'll get it on the screen. The word
at the top, what does that say, Andre?

58:39.040 --> 58:42.400
-What have you done to it?
-Nothing, just try and read it out.

58:42.480 --> 58:46.200
Just try and read it out. You can read it?
I haven't done anything to it.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.560
-You can read that, yes?
-It looks like the letters are mixed up.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.520
Well, can you try and pronounce it?

58:52.600 --> 58:56.240
-Can you read it?
-T-b-hurritumajer.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.200
OK, maybe that's difficult.
We'll do another one. There you go.

59:00.280 --> 59:04.240
Page 15. We'll do page 15, right? You can
read this on the top? You can see that?

59:04.320 --> 59:07.000
You can see that there, yes?
Yep, they can see it.

59:07.080 --> 59:10.720
And on the screen. The word at the top.
Try and say it, just try and pronounce it.

59:10.800 --> 59:14.600
-Z-berg-er-ba-ti-jer.
- And then this one here?

59:14.680 --> 59:16.320
[Andre laughs]

59:16.400 --> 59:17.880
Go on.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.600
Mm-te-ger-bug-ol.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.080
You're doing great.
Here we are. Look, one last one.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.800
That's a word. You can read that,
can't you? What does that say?

59:24.880 --> 59:26.520
-Thighs.
- Again?

59:26.600 --> 59:28.680
-Thighs.
-Thighs?

59:28.760 --> 59:30.840
-Thighs.
-Thighs?

59:30.920 --> 59:34.520
We need to look a bit more carefully
at your sitting, Andre. OK, Lord,

59:34.600 --> 59:37.560
restore his eyesight so that
he can read your word, Lord,

59:37.640 --> 59:40.480
and give witness to your miracles
here tonight. The devil is released.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.720
-One more time, Andre. What does that say?
-Thanks.

59:42.800 --> 59:46.520
Thanks! I give thanks to you, Lord!
We give thanks to you, Andre.

59:46.600 --> 59:49.280
You can sit yourself back down.
And he goes back to his seat

59:49.360 --> 59:52.440
a committed believer,
ladies and gentlemen!

59:52.520 --> 59:57.480
A committed believer! And one of
you here is to receive this anointing.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.680
A powerful anointing. The anointing
of the Lord as the Holy Spirit.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.080
And it flows like a river of love

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.160
from the throne of grace
through the hearts of believers.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.440
Bringing the gift of life to
all those who receive its touch.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.880
And one of you is to receive it now.
Tuck your feet in and then sit forward.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.760
Bow your head for me. Thank you,
Gerty, and close your eyes.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.760
Be ready to receive a blessing.
Do the same, Shannon.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.640
Thank you.
Sir, you can keep your eyes open.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.840
This anointing is for you.
Come and stand here in the middle.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.720
Come and stand here.
So one foot there, one foot there.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.520
Thank you, that's lovely.
Bring your head down.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.400
Be ready to receive this blessing.
Hands by your sides.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.680
So important that people know we
don't know each other. Your name again?

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.280
-Damian.
-Damian.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.960
-Yes.
-Perfect. Damian...

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.120
-[laughter]
-What do you for a living?

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.560
I'm in the Air Force in Australia.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.360
I haven't asked you where your... Oh!

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.440
I can see where the healing is. It's in
your... It's here in your lower back.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.600
Yeah.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.520
-You've had about a year of pain there.
-Correct.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.480
What's it like now?
What's happened tonight?

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.800
I feel a lot looser and flexible.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.200
You've got more movement,
more flexibility? No pain?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.200
Yep, no pain and a lot more
feeling of confidence in myself.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.720
Wonderful. This is just the start. Turn
your palms forward like this, Damian.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.480
Now close your eyes and
be ready to receive this anointing.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.800
If you're ready, I want you to nod your
head so I know you're ready. Good.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.800
It's going to feel strange, Damian,
like a golden light moving through you.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.200
The Lord wants you to sit with him on
his throne at the right-hand side of God.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.760
Bring your head back. Get ready
to receive this anointing, Damian.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.560
And receive it now! And it lifts your
heart and it flows like a river of love

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.240
from the throne of grace
through the hearts of believers,

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.240
bringing the gift of life!

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.120
I've got you all the way down,
to all those... All the way down!

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.840
All those who receive its touch.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.600
Those of you seated in the chairs,
come back to us. You can open your eyes.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.600
Come back to us. Please, open your
eyes and now head back to your seats.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.200
Would you please head back for me?
Thank you, the five of you.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.840
Thank you so much,
thank you for coming up.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.000
Now, Damian, you are to take
something with you tonight.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.480
A change, an important change,
not just at the physical level of healing,

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.760
that will be whatever it is,
but more importantly,

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.080
at a level of something
you're going to learn,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.400
more importantly something
you're going to learn tonight

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.840
which you're going to take
with you into the future.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.480
And as you look into the future
now, Damian, it looks really good.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.720
It looks colourful

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800
and it feels good.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.280
Now come back to us
and open your eyes.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.640
Up you get.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.880
Look at me.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.720
-Feel good?
-Yes.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.520
Yes! You can go sit yourself back down.
Thank you so much, Damian.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.760
And he goes back to his seat
with a song of victory in his heart!

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.440
[applause]

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.600
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.920
If there's an usher there, I just want to
grab a few watches from somebody.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.280
If you've got a watch with a second hand,
if I could borrow two or three. Thank you.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.960
Alright, if you've had a healing here
tonight, that's a wonderful thing.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.720
And that release and that relief
can stay with you.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.840
But if you are taking pills for something,
you need to continue to take your pills.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.440
Or if you've got a condition that needs
checking out, do get it checked out,

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.400
and maybe don't throw
your glasses away quite yet.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.080
Danielle, you may still
need them at some point.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.360
The miracle here is not
the healing power of the Lord

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.040
or magic tricks,
or floating people in the air.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.840
The miracle is the fact
that a lifetime of chronic pain...

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.800
can just disappear in an instant

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.880
when we tell ourselves a different story.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.920
The moment you entertain the notion

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.040
that a healing might be
moving through the room,

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.000
those symptoms can just go.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.880
And that is so much more
beautiful and resonant to me

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.760
because it isn't about the power of God,
it's about the power of us,

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.160
as human beings, so it's real.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240
That's a miracle.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.800
Here's another miracle.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.080
The fact that you are
sat there right now.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:20.000
The fact that you specifically
are sat there, that you are

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.840
specifically you, as opposed
to you being someone else,

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.920
some other permutation of DNA.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.560
What are the chances you even exist?
What does that even mean?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.480
What is that? One of your father's 12
trillion sperm with half your name on it,

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.440
just happening to collide with one
of your mother's thousands of eggs

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.880
with the other half of your name on it.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.400
That's just your parents having you. It
had to be specifically your grandparents

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.080
having specifically your parents too.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.640
You've got to multiply those odds
down every generation

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.760
of human or humanoid kind.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.520
You are undeniably at one end
of your very own perfect,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.200
unbroken ancestral chain
that starts with you

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.880
and goes right the way back to
the very first single-celled organism,

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.080
seven billion years ago.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.720
That is a miracle.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.080
And we can remember that
when we tell ourselves we're a bit fat

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.360
or our lives are a bit rubbish. This is
the one life and the one body we have.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.560
We can tell ourselves
a different story about it at least.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.200
We can be kinder to ourselves...

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.280
and therefore to others as well
because we're all doing it.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.040
We're all telling ourselves
those unhelpful stories, all of us.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.640
Everyone you meet is dragging around
their own heavy case of bricks.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.280
Hard to remember all of this, I realise,
when you're just trying to get ahead

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.920
and get through your day and...

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.080
get to the thing you're trying to get to,
and I think what's important though

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.920
is sometimes when we remember...

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.840
is to mentally stop time

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.240
and return to that present moment,

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.440
and how we're treating ourselves
and each other in that moment.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.000
Because it's only the present moment
that has the power

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.080
to be utterly compelling

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.120
and rich and vibrant...

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.160
as if that moment...

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.240
were you're first.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.080
[clock ticks]

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.440
Or as if...

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.880
it were...

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.840
your last.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.280
[clock stops ticking]

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.000
You are the miracle.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.520
Goodnight.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.720
[cheering and applause]

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.400
[music plays]

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.440
Oh, wait, sorry! Can we cut
the music for one second?

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520
Cut the music for just a moment.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.880
You know what affects those stories,
of course, more than anything?

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.720
The stories we tell ourselves
every day about

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.120
what we care about, what's important,

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.080
what our opinions are,
ultimately who we are, is the media.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.440
Right, they literally
sell us a story every day.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.400
Newspapers are worse at it than anything.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.800
And you know what the worst newspaper
of them all is for doing this?

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.120
-[man] <i>The Daily Mail.
-Famously. <i>The Daily Mail.</i></i>

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.960
Specifically <i>The Mail On Sunday.</i>

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:03.160
Does anybody have a copy of
<i>The Mail On Sunday on them by any chance?</i>

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.040
You do, cos I gave you one at the start
of the show. Get the envelope out.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.040
I'll take it back, thank you.
You haven't opened this?

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.080
-No one's taken it off you? Thank you.
-No.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.240
Still sealed. Great. Number 16
still on the front. Good.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.360
Thank you for that, Chris.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.359
We think we're forming our own opinions,
right? Making our own decisions.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.399
This stuff is getting in our heads
every day.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:23.640
Or, specifically perhaps,
every week, every Sunday.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.760
This is <i>The Mail On Sunday.</i>

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.319
This is not the current one.
This is from November 8th, right?

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:31.560
I choose a different one for every night.
I have used this one before.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.840
And bear this in mind,
every night before doing this show,

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.800
I have to go through over three months
worth of <i>Daily Mails and <i>Mails on Sundays.</i></i>

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.319
Have you any idea
how fucking depressing that is?

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:47.000
Every night! Look, this stuff
gets in our heads all the time.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.680
This is the country's most read
Sunday newspaper.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.120
<i>The Daily Mail is the country's
most read daily newspaper</i>

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.800
and <i>The Mail Online,
get your head round this,</i>

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.920
<i>The Mail Online is the most looked-at
newspaper website in the world.</i>

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.160
<i>The Mail, in the world.</i>

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.840
Get your head round that.
It's getting in our heads every day.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.120
When we think we're making
our own decisions.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.080
Remember, at the start of the show
we did the brain fart exercise

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.680
and we had the weird,
the slightly weird... What was it?

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.760
What was the one over there? Private...?

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.960
-[audience] Caught, blender.
-Thank you. Bit of a strange one.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.080
But, remember, I said do it like looking
at the front page of a Sunday newspaper?

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.920
I said make it from weeks and weeks ago so
you're not distracted by topical events.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.479
Well, here is one from weeks and
weeks ago, the one I chose for tonight.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.319
And, right here on the front page,

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:37.479
the very first word of the article
capitalised there is "Private".

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.960
Yes? And then, look, right in the middle
of the article there "caught". "Private".

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.520
"Caught". And up here
on the right, top right,

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.040
an advert for "this superb blender".
This stuff gets in our heads!

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.960
It gets in our heads! It feels...

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.560
Thank you.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:02.080
But it feels so fair, doesn't it?
Like... Oh! Oh, like...

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.120
Like, at the start of the show, when we're
bouncing a balloon around the audience.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.000
Remember this? We came up
with this story for consequences.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.400
Camilla Parker Bowles
holding a small dog.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.920
I'm so pleased we're filming it tonight,
cos I don't think it's ever going to hit

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.200
quite as on the nose as it has tonight.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.240
Camilla Parker Bowles holding
a small dog, you said. Look, look.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.720
The number 16 on here refers
to page 16 in that newspaper.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.520
Page 16, I've already got it bookmarked,
so I can open it straight to it.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.320
If you do find a copy from 8th November,
there it is, page 16 is what you want.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.880
And the story on page 16...

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.440
Thank you!

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.000
..is led by...

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.880
a picture of Camilla Parker Bowles

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.040
holding a small dog!

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.440
[cheering and applause]

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.880
Now... admittedly,

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.880
she's not sat on a cucumber
in that picture...

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.440
[laughter]

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.360
..which was the next thing you said,
although, although...

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.920
if we pull out a bit, that article
is sat on another article

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.920
about the British
cucumber-growing industry.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.520
And, wait, wait, hold it back! And says,

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.040
"You've grown since I last saw you."

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.640
That was the end of the story.
I draw your collective attention

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.280
to the headline at the top of that page,

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.240
"You've grown since
I last saw you, Charles"!

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.600
He's had this for the whole of the show.
It gets in your head!

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.200
It gets in your head,

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.920
and it feels so...
I tell you something...

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.720
I tell you something that got in my head.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.280
Three months ago, when I called up
<i>The Mail on Sunday</i>

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.160
to place an ad in the back,
in the personal section.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.720
Alright? Remember the game
that we played with Sofia,

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.600
the lady that came up and the bags,

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.520
and one had a nail in, and, do you
remember, she mixed them into a line?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.720
And she could have put the nail
in any position in that line.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.200
And tonight, she put it in bag number
three. Remember that? The Holy Trinity.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.520
Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Tonight,
she puts it in bag number three.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.240
Obviously, any night it goes
in a different bag, right?

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.640
Here is my prediction for tonight.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.320
"The nail will be kept in bag number 3".

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.040
Wait. "And another bag will be
knocked off the table by a clumsy cow".

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.400
Thank you so much for coming!

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.400
Goodnight!

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.280
[cheering and applause]

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.480
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.720
Thank you, people at the top!

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.480
Wow! Thank you so much!

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.960
Thank you for coming!

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.520
Goodnight!
