WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:02.440
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.469 --> 00:05.880
- What's this?
- Oh, it's a benefit for garrity,

00:05.920 --> 00:08.750
help him out with his medical expenses
at the bar this saturday night.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.720
My band's playing, we're totally gonna rock.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.060
I suggest we pack the place
full of totally hot chicks.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.600
That's not a bad idea, actually.

00:14.630 --> 00:17.490
Maybe you could have your girlfriend
invite some of her friends.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.760
You know, I'm sure she's got some
hot phillies in her stable, right?

00:19.780 --> 00:21.230
Yeah. And a couple of bulls, too, I think.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.230
So you think I'm a lesbo 'cause your
friends at work think I'm a lesbo?

00:24.250 --> 00:26.510
Hey.
I don't think that, ok?

00:26.530 --> 00:28.030
I've just been thinking about it.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.170
I have needs.
You have needs.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.590
It's mutual.

00:31.610 --> 00:34.010
You're saying that you
want to have sex with me

00:34.030 --> 00:35.940
- with no strings attached?
- Yeah.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.730
What, you're being intimate
with janet and sheila again?

00:38.740 --> 00:40.160
- Maybe I am.
- Let me guess,

00:40.180 --> 00:42.740
it's a no strings arrangement, right?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.000
And it was their idea, am I right?

00:44.020 --> 00:45.330
- Yes.
- These are women, tom.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.910
Women have-they got more
strings than a goddamn baseball.

00:47.930 --> 00:50.140
So what's up, man?
When are you coming back to work?

00:50.170 --> 00:51.290
Soon, I think.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.450
Doctor said I gotta take
2 weeks rest at home,

00:53.470 --> 00:55.450
then another couple weeks
to get my strength back.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.160
Dude, you know, you don't want to overdo it.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.140
This whole experience has made me realize,

00:59.170 --> 01:01.240
I'm gonna totally overdo it from now on.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.770
I'm just gonna live my
life bigger, you know.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.510
Wow!

01:05.530 --> 01:07.040
No sudden moves.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.440
We don't want to frighten her off.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.490
Ok, uh, who the hell is that and
why is she looking for needles?

01:13.520 --> 01:16.800
Well that, my dear friends, is mrs. Needles.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.840
So needles got a russian mail order bride?

01:18.860 --> 01:21.860
I love you. And when 2
people have that connection,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.840
you go for it.
You follow your first impulse.

01:24.850 --> 01:29.160
Mine was to ask you to marry me.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.200
It's the goddamn finals, lou!

01:33.220 --> 01:34.700
I know it's the goddamn finals, tommy!

01:34.730 --> 01:36.230
I've got 50 bucks riding on this!

01:38.360 --> 01:39.800
Your pieholes!

01:39.820 --> 01:41.940
- Hey, you getting the game on?
- No, screw the game.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.610
Dancing with the stars finals are coming on.

01:47.590 --> 01:50.560
You bunch of queers.
Look at you.

01:50.590 --> 01:52.840
Watching a bunch of hollywood
pansies gliding around.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.470
It's like figure skating without the skates.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.020
And what the hell is this?

01:57.040 --> 02:00.070
Oh, it's a flyer for garrity's
cancer benefit tomorrow night.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.090
He beat the cancer.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.510
Yeah, but he couldn't
beat his medical bills.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.680
So we're going to help him out by
having a benefit down at the bar.

02:04.710 --> 02:06.500
Ah, that's nice.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.370
- Apache stone?
- Yeah, that's mike's band.

02:09.389 --> 02:12.240
Sounds like dances with wolves
got a salt deposit in his kidney.

02:12.270 --> 02:12.960
Thank you.

02:12.990 --> 02:16.100
Ok, I've been saying that from the
beginning. Mike, you know I like your band.

02:16.130 --> 02:20.000
But I think we can all agree
- the band name sucks. Ok?

02:20.030 --> 02:21.600
Listen, when I was in high school, you know,

02:21.630 --> 02:23.880
we were thinking of maybe one day
having a band and we came up with a name.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.660
Of course we never formed
the band, but I'm telling you,

02:25.690 --> 02:28.660
it's a cool name. It's rock & roll,
it's cutting edge. That's what you need.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.590
A lot of people don't even
know the sex pistols' music,

02:30.630 --> 02:32.160
but you know the name of that band, right?

02:32.180 --> 02:34.670
That's what you need, something
that's going to stick with people.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.710
So get this-

02:37.740 --> 02:39.400
the douchebags.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.850
Hear me out. Because you
call yourself the dbs, right?

02:42.870 --> 02:44.850
Which is kind of mysterious
and still rock & roll sounding.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.660
But then when you get a little, you know,
people are interviewing you and stuff,

02:47.690 --> 02:50.720
when they say, "what does
db stand for?" You say...

02:50.740 --> 02:53.210
the douchebags.
What do you think?

02:53.230 --> 02:55.730
Then everyone's going to
think we're douchebags, tom.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.500
- Oh, good, I got it.
- Yeah!

03:00.530 --> 03:01.290
All right!

03:01.320 --> 03:03.610
You guys watch posse
full of pussies dancing.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.420
I'm going up to my office
to watch some football.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.830
Yeah.

03:06.860 --> 03:07.890
Hey.

03:07.910 --> 03:09.570
Is that the defensive tackle from tampa bay?

03:09.600 --> 03:10.280
Yeah.

03:10.310 --> 03:13.030
And he's teamed up with heather
locklear, who's just out of rehab.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.110
And he just got out of jail.

03:14.140 --> 03:15.930
- He sure did.
- Slide over.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.470
Anybody taking action?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.800
Lou is.

03:18.820 --> 03:20.330
Put me down for 20.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074

04:15.640 --> 04:17.310
How it's going?

04:24.450 --> 04:27.070
Hi. How it's going?

04:27.090 --> 04:28.610
Ok, how are you?

04:28.630 --> 04:31.980
Oh, I've been better.
I just had a kidney removed.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.110
Get a new line.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.530
You know, I seriously did.
I'll show you the scar.

04:37.550 --> 04:38.820
- What's up, bro?
- Hey, man.

04:38.850 --> 04:40.620
- How are you holding up?
- I feel like shit.

04:40.650 --> 04:42.340
- Because of the surgery?
- No, the band.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.320
I feel like I'm getting ear chemo.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.820
- Me, too.
- Hey.

04:45.850 --> 04:46.340
Hey, bro.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.980
I hope you assholes are appreciating the
level of talent that's showing up tonight, ok?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.760
We got some very smoking ladies here,

04:51.800 --> 04:53.590
and I'd say 70% of them
are friends of carla'S.

04:53.610 --> 04:56.670
So that means we can cease and desist
with the my girlfriend's a lesbo talk, ok?

04:56.700 --> 04:58.550
Franco, first of all, it's ladies' night.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.130
Second of all, look how touchy-feely
they're being with each other.

05:01.150 --> 05:02.480
It's just pretty goddamn gay.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.460
And if 70% of these chicks know your girl,
there's a pretty good chance that,

05:05.490 --> 05:08.840
statistically speaking, your
girlfriend's a goddamned lesbian, son!

05:08.870 --> 05:11.060
Jesus christ. You guys, I
gotta get laid, all right?

05:11.080 --> 05:11.830
It's been forever, ok?

05:11.870 --> 05:14.280
I was sick and then I had the surgery.
It's been like 6 months.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.790
I've been jerking off so much lately,

05:15.820 --> 05:17.950
any day now I'm going to yank
my ass through to the front.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.540
Hey, listen.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.810
If carla's friends showed up and
they were all a bunch of bull dykes,

05:21.840 --> 05:24.740
then maybe I'd start worrying that
she was gay. But that's not the case.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.290
What you're looking at, son, is a
flock of very fine lipstick lesbians,

05:28.320 --> 05:30.980
which means they're hot,
possibly on the fence sexually,

05:31.010 --> 05:33.950
which means probably willing
to play both sides of the line,

05:33.970 --> 05:36.100
which means you guys could
be getting the same great sex

05:36.130 --> 05:38.750
that I'm getting with my alleged
lesbian if you play your cards right.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.820
Ok, well, I'm just going to
check my penis at the door,

05:40.850 --> 05:42.580
'cause clearly I won't be
needing it tonight. Thanks a lot.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.410
- No.
- Hey, can I get another brew?

05:44.430 --> 05:46.440
- Hey, big lou.
- Yo.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.280
Enjoying the scenery?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.760
Yeah, you know, usually I
try to drink myself blind.

05:50.780 --> 05:51.940
Tonight I'm going for deaf.

05:51.970 --> 05:53.400
What, you're not a fan of apache stone?

05:53.420 --> 05:55.220
No, where's custer when you need him?

05:55.240 --> 05:58.510
Hoist your glasses, boys.
Your friend lou is getting hitched.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.720
- Shut the hell up, really?
- Yeah, yeah, absolute truth.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.310
The girl asked, I thought about it,

06:03.340 --> 06:06.950
and then I took a page from
garrity's grab the moment guidebook

06:06.970 --> 06:09.220
and I decided to go for it.
Live for today.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.520
Live for today, yeah,
but what about tonight?

06:11.550 --> 06:14.300
You never know, lou, something real
interesting could walk through the door.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.220
Oh, yeah, you know, be
careful what you wish for.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.900
Miss chechnya 2004 just drove up.

06:20.930 --> 06:22.930
Oh, shit.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.810
Yeah, and it looks like
she's already had a few, boys.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.260
A few dozen.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.020
She's definitely got a foreign load on.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.370
- Mrs. Needles!
- Mrs. Needles!

06:29.390 --> 06:31.630
- Hello!
- Hi.

06:32.250 --> 06:32.870
How are you?

06:33.970 --> 06:35.890
Yeah, gesundheit.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.440
Uh, sure.

06:38.070 --> 06:39.250
America.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.700
Yeah.
You are peachy.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.040
Listen, tonight, keep an eye on your vagina

06:44.080 --> 06:46.430
because the place is lousy with lesbos.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.670
It's the chief's wife!

06:48.700 --> 06:50.420
She doesn't understand
a word I'm saying. Watch.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.690
I like doggie style.
Do you like doggie style?

06:53.730 --> 06:54.860
Absolutely.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.410
Yeah, here's a question I've
always wanted to ask a chief's wife.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.550
Are you shaved or unshaved?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.920
Oh, that's too far, dude.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.720
That probably means unshaved.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.530
- Unshaved!
- To being unshaved.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.360
- All right!
- Yeah!

07:22.890 --> 07:25.590
# Innocence, insincere politics, #

07:25.610 --> 07:28.090
# told by society, #

07:28.120 --> 07:30.440
# when does meet the end #

07:30.470 --> 07:32.510
Party!

07:32.530 --> 07:35.370
What are you guys doing
standing around talking?

07:35.390 --> 07:37.440
You gotta get one of these chicks!

07:40.130 --> 07:41.630
Party!

07:42.520 --> 07:45.140
Oh, man, some people just
make shitty alcoholics.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.710
- Amen, brother.
- Sorry about the delay.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.630
There's lesbians 6 deep at the bar,
and I guess they like their booze.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.930
I never wanted to thank you
for anything, you douchebag,

07:54.960 --> 07:57.540
but I want to thank you for
getting me drinking again.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.040
For the first time in years, I
feel like I got nothing to hide.

08:00.070 --> 08:01.710
Yeah.
Other than the gay thing.

08:03.470 --> 08:05.320
Hey, guys, no, seriously, listen up.

08:05.350 --> 08:07.790
You know, we've had our fun. We had
our little trip down memory lane,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.560
tied a couple on. Had a good...

08:10.580 --> 08:12.780
but I think it's time to
take it down a notch now.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.070
You know what I mean.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.570
Straighten it up, pluggin' the jug.
What do you say?

08:16.590 --> 08:18.620
Why don't we get out of here,

08:18.640 --> 08:21.360
go find a meeting?

08:23.930 --> 08:25.940
I'm kidding!
Forget it!

08:25.960 --> 08:27.120
You're so serious, all of you.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.980
Jesus.
You had me going there.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.450
I thought you were serious.

08:30.470 --> 08:31.910
Jesus.

08:31.930 --> 08:35.789
I think I'm gonna take a stroll around
the room, see if I can get lucky.

08:35.809 --> 08:37.760
You know, there's only 2 problems with that.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.900
They're all gay, you're all married.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.770
So what if they're queer?
I like a challenge.

08:42.799 --> 08:46.860
And as for ellie, now that I'm
back on the sauce, so is she.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.160
She spends half the time
passed out flat on her ass.

08:50.180 --> 08:53.490
Which means teddy can do
whatever the hell he wants.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.200
Last night, I didn't feel like
walking all the way to the can.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.840
So I took a leak in the kitchen sink.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.380
Some people might call that a blackout.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.320
I call it my little pocket of freedom.

09:12.050 --> 09:14.060
I'm gonna go get me one of those lesbos.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.120
All right, good luck.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.680
See, eddie, don't ever get married.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.920
Oh, right, I performed the...

09:25.770 --> 09:27.630
Ceremony?

09:29.200 --> 09:33.100
Hey, you know, talking of weddings,

09:33.120 --> 09:35.410
when were you gonna tell us all about lou?

09:35.430 --> 09:36.810
What about lou?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.460
He's getting married.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.470
Got some chick named candy.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.810
- You're shittin' me.
- No.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.990
Jesus christ.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.480
Party!

09:47.500 --> 09:49.680
Rock & roll!

09:51.770 --> 09:53.730
Well, at least he's wearing pants.

09:55.590 --> 09:58.230
Ok, you're into chicks,
and I'm fine with that.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.790
To each your own.
Ok, I'm cool with that, all right?

10:00.820 --> 10:04.060
But I just found out that my girl,

10:04.080 --> 10:08.150
she had this chick on chick
thing going on in the past, and,

10:08.170 --> 10:11.370
I'll be honest
- it's freaking me out a little bit.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.170
- Is she pretty?
- Of course she's pretty.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.910
You have a number for her?Maybe I can
talk to her a little, see where she's at.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.800
Does needles know his wife is here?

10:30.820 --> 10:32.590
She's here?

10:32.610 --> 10:34.980
Oh, shit, it's an epidemic.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.290
I hope he's not here. He
wouldn't be too happy about this.

10:37.310 --> 10:39.640
- I'm conflicted myself.
- Yeah, me, too.

10:39.650 --> 10:42.880
I don't know whether to jerk off or
run out and buy a disposable camera.

10:43.450 --> 10:44.720
I think I'm sobering up.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.750
I need a refill, this guy never sees me.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.900
I'm going to the other end of the bar.
You guys want anything?

10:48.920 --> 10:52.100
- Yeah, get me a vodka rocks.
- I'll take a vodka rocks-

10:56.410 --> 10:57.910
So...

10:58.820 --> 11:00.580
getting married, huh?

11:02.160 --> 11:05.220
Yeah. Yeah.
Is that a problem?

11:05.960 --> 11:09.120
Well, you're marrying your
ex-hooker, ex-thief girlfriend,

11:09.150 --> 11:13.130
you didn't tell your supposedly
best buddy in the world?

11:13.150 --> 11:15.770
Gee, you know, and I wonder
why I wouldn't do that.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.520
You know, I mean, I tell
ya, it may sound crazy,

11:19.550 --> 11:23.140
but listening to garrity's
speech last week about, you know,

11:23.160 --> 11:25.050
just grabbing life by the balls-

11:25.070 --> 11:28.310
Ok, lou, let me get this straight. You're
taking life advice from garrity now?

11:28.340 --> 11:33.120
Why don't you just take driving tips from
goddamn billy joel, for christ sake?Jesus.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.730
I was thinking a lot about
what sean said, too, you know?

11:35.760 --> 11:38.770
About, you know, life's a gift and
you gotta do what you love to do.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.760
Absolutely.

11:39.780 --> 11:43.240
That's why I decided that I'm going to

11:43.260 --> 11:46.290
put in my papers so I can focus on my music.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.280
- Why is that funny, lou?
- You're not doing that.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.540
That's where my heart is, tom.

11:53.550 --> 11:55.290
Look, I don't give a shit
where your heart is, asshole.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.700
Think about where your wallet is, ok?

11:56.720 --> 11:59.100
The fire department, all right?
What's going on?

11:59.130 --> 12:02.280
Garrity puts 2 sentences together
for the first time in his whole life

12:02.300 --> 12:05.080
and you guys are latching onto
it like it's goddamn scripture?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.460
I'm gonna start latching on, too.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.060
I mean, here I am asking advice
from strange lesbians about colleen

12:11.090 --> 12:14.210
when I should be going straight to
colleen and deal with the issues myself,

12:14.230 --> 12:16.960
and deal with it head on.
Right now.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.490
It's time to live for today.

12:18.510 --> 12:19.830
- For today.
- Cheers to that.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.340
You see what I'm saying?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.890
Now I just want to be clear here.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.630
You're going to marry the ex-hooker,

12:27.650 --> 12:29.940
just like ernest borgnine in
the poseidon adventure, you

12:29.970 --> 12:31.510
are going to give up your
firefighting career for

12:31.550 --> 12:35.530
a supposed career in music with A... band.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.690
You're gonna go have a face-off
head to head with a female gavin?

12:38.710 --> 12:39.260
Damn right.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.580
Franco, you got any stupid
shit that you have planned?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.470
- No, I'm good.
- Ok.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.040
I say go ahead, boys, it's a new day.

12:46.050 --> 12:48.230
But hang on for dear
life 'cause it's gonna be

12:48.250 --> 12:50.910
one never-ending gimongous shit storm.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.320
- Hello, boys.
- Hey, garrity.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.880
- Hey, want to do me a favor?
- Yeah, mean.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.490
- Next time you get cancer?
- Uh-huh?

12:56.520 --> 12:57.990
Die.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.190
What-what did I do?

13:03.820 --> 13:05.980
Guys!
I tried to stop them!

13:06.010 --> 13:07.060
You're supposed to be watching the door!

13:07.090 --> 13:09.050
I told them they couldn't come
in, and they pushed right past me.

13:09.085 --> 13:09.545
Calm down!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.860
Pushed past you- who pushed past you?Nils?

13:11.880 --> 13:14.410
Oh, christ.

13:22.130 --> 13:26.160
Batten down the hatches, put
locks on the men's room door.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.550
We got bull dykes.

13:30.350 --> 13:32.610
Jesus christ.
I'm banging a gay chick.

13:33.570 --> 13:35.150
Yeah.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.220
Jesus.
It's like dykeapalooza in here.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.690
Yeah, why can't these chicks show up
when we have, like, furniture to move.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.070
Yeah, when they could
use their powers for good.

13:47.090 --> 13:49.450
I heard they don't get their periods.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.580
Where'd you hear that, asshole?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.610
- Chief feinberg.
- It's true!

13:53.645 --> 13:54.930
All right.

13:54.950 --> 13:56.600
Holy shit, one of them
just got mrs. Needles!

13:56.610 --> 13:57.540
Oh!

13:57.560 --> 13:59.510
Oh, my god, I think I'm going to puke.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.200
Yeah, well, just aim towards
your drummer, will you?

14:01.220 --> 14:03.270
Ok, guys, if needles finds
out about this, we're all dead.

14:03.290 --> 14:04.490
We gotta break this shit up pronto.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.980
All right, I got the chains.
Who's got a trailer hitch?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.890
Judging from the crowd, there's
probably 5 or 6 parked right out front.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.610
Hey, what's the deal
with all the bull dykes?

14:12.630 --> 14:14.350
It's hard enough trying
to make it with a lesbian.

14:14.370 --> 14:16.180
I don't need this goddamn competition.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.170
All right, well, we gotta
get that blonde broad

14:18.190 --> 14:19.970
away from that one dyke
over there in the corner.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.260
I can take her.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.650
Hell, I can take her right now.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.460
I'm 3 and oh against dykes.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.920
And I'm not talking about
the soft bitches, either.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.620
I'm talking lawrence taylor
with a vagina type broads.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.700
All right, well, you can distract them.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.980
Mike, lou, you grab mrs.
Needles and meet me out front.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.880
- Who's got a car?
- Mine's a couple blocks away.

14:34.900 --> 14:35.840
Grab it!

14:35.870 --> 14:38.620
Meet us a couple doors
down in a few minutes.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.060
You ready?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.620
When it comes to fightin'
lesbos, I was born ready.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.380
- You heard of mike tyson?
- Yeah.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.120
I'm dyke tyson.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.480
Uh, you guys think we should go back him up?

14:50.500 --> 14:51.920
Yeah!
Let's do it!

14:56.980 --> 15:00.740
Hey, samantha ronson, mind if I cut in?

15:01.370 --> 15:03.630
Yeah, that's right.
I know who she is.

15:03.650 --> 15:06.170
What did you just say, shithead?

15:06.190 --> 15:08.870
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart, I speak cock,

15:08.890 --> 15:12.280
which I know you don't understand.

15:14.460 --> 15:17.270
You shouldn't have done that.

15:17.290 --> 15:18.150
Come on.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.870
Hey.
Where is she?

15:22.900 --> 15:24.290
- Who?
- What do you mean, what?

15:24.310 --> 15:26.320
- Oh, she's gone.
- Gone where?

15:26.340 --> 15:29.540
She got lost in the fracas 'cause
you were inside lollygagging.

15:29.570 --> 15:31.530
My uncle's fighting a lesbian,
you call that goddamn lollygagging?

15:31.570 --> 15:33.900
- Seriously, where is she?
- I don't know where she went, she's gone.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.570
Yo, guys, you're not going to believe this.

15:35.580 --> 15:40.420
I'm in the hallway puking, and some hot
ass blonde chick just gave me a blowjob.

15:40.450 --> 15:42.650
- What?
- No, I'm serious.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.010
I've got to get her number.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.090
- Where'd the hell she go, tommy?
- He lost her.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.700
Oh, shit!

15:48.720 --> 15:50.870
- Yo, come on, not on my rims!
- Hey!

15:50.890 --> 15:54.120
You want to come get this crazy
white bitch out of my apartment?

15:54.150 --> 15:56.830
Hey, don't touch that!
That don't belong to you!

15:56.865 --> 15:59.110
Oh, lord, jesus!

16:00.650 --> 16:02.280
Hey, that's the chick that blew me.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.040
I didn't get your number!
Hey!

16:08.470 --> 16:10.550
What the hell are you two doing here?

16:12.480 --> 16:15.400
Special delivery.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.910
- What happened?
- She showed up at the bar.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.720
Must have found one of those apache
stone flyers lying around the firehouse.

16:27.750 --> 16:28.920
And you two let her get blasted?

16:28.940 --> 16:31.780
- Hey, it was an apache stone gig.
- And she's the lucky one.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.330
The rest of us had to
listen to the band play.

16:33.350 --> 16:36.510
- Yeah, us and the lesbos.
- There were lesbos?

16:36.530 --> 16:38.650
- Yeah. You don't want to know.
- And bull dykes.

16:43.490 --> 16:44.800
Why is she laughing?

16:44.830 --> 16:47.130
- Becausehere was a little-
- I don't want to know.

16:47.150 --> 16:49.220
I can't believe you
brought her here, to work.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.580
Well, it was either here or the gulag.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.530
- The russian embassy.
- I know what a gulag is.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.830
You, watch her.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.069
- In here, rasputin.
- Rasputin.

17:06.140 --> 17:11.040
The way I figure, you
kind of owe me a big favor.

17:11.069 --> 17:13.740
So I would like you to stop busting my balls

17:13.770 --> 17:17.050
and holding all this shit over my head.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.589
And by all this shit, you
mean your excessive drinking,

17:20.630 --> 17:23.500
sex with your wife in the
storage closet of this house,

17:23.530 --> 17:27.829
a physical altercation with
a superior officer, namely me?

17:27.849 --> 17:32.070
And your general tommy gavin
cowboy bullshit behavior?

17:33.640 --> 17:36.650
Yeah, that would be it.
So we're square.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.470
Tom, come here.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.910
We're not even close to square.

17:39.940 --> 17:43.700
All right, what you did tonight was
personal, and I appreciate it, I really do.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.700
But everything else
between us is professional.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.820
The ball busting's going to continue.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.150
- You understand?
- Yeah.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.580
- Good.
- Ok.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.830
Professionally, I think I'm
going to go down to the ins

17:52.860 --> 17:55.900
and just report that you might have
a completely illegal alien as a wife.

17:55.930 --> 17:58.710
- How's that for-
- Sneezy, sneezy, sneezy-

17:58.740 --> 18:03.180
no, no, mrs. Needles, mrs. Needles, this
- this is not right!

18:03.200 --> 18:04.540
Me and you are square.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.510
- Me and you got a problem.
- No, no, no, I'm the victim!

18:06.530 --> 18:08.220
- You're goddamn right you're the victim!
- I'm the victim!

18:08.700 --> 18:10.980
- I'm the victim!
- Get out of here!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.500
You all right?

18:12.520 --> 18:13.860
You ok?

18:13.890 --> 18:15.240
Did he hurt you?

18:15.270 --> 18:17.040
He is an idiot van.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.080
He didn't hurt you, did he?

18:19.100 --> 18:21.010
- Da.
- Good.

18:23.730 --> 18:24.780
Good night.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.410
Well, we sure raked it in
at that benefit last night.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.520
Yeah. Who knew lesbians
were such big tippers?

18:33.540 --> 18:36.300
It's 'cause we had that piper
perabo-looking chick working the bar.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.030
Coyote ugly, baby.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.640
You know, speaking of ugly, exactly
what look is your drummer going for?

18:41.670 --> 18:45.360
- Uh, gay.
- Yeah.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.050
I was going to go along the lines
of fabio with aids, but gay works.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.240
Come on, guys. You know he's just-

18:51.270 --> 18:53.950
you know, he's trying to-

18:53.990 --> 18:56.170
I guess he does look pretty gay.

18:56.190 --> 18:57.500
That one thing though, those

18:57.530 --> 19:00.220
lainy dykesters just paid for
all the repairs, all the damage.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.820
I know, they're classy broads for
broads who don't, you know, really

19:03.850 --> 19:05.780
look like broads.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.880
Maybe we should just go back
to a full-time lesbo bar.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.770
Yeah.
Take out the urinals in the men's room.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.510
Although I did see one
of them piss in a urinal.

19:14.540 --> 19:15.910
I didn't think that shit was possible.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.780
We are not going to turn this
place into a lesbo bar, ok?

19:18.820 --> 19:21.780
I'm kind of anti-lesbo right now, seeing
as how my ex-girlfriend might be one.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.540
Might be, he says.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.680
Still can't believe mrs. Needles blew derek.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.310
What?

19:29.340 --> 19:32.130
Uh, no, no, no, when I said blew,

19:32.150 --> 19:34.800
I mean blew as in

19:34.830 --> 19:38.600
flew right past him to
get to that lesbian chick.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.790
Who she was just talking to.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.460
Right, guys?

19:44.490 --> 19:46.260
We do not know what you
are talking about, damian.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.400
- No, my brother.
- Ah, nothing.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.050
I'm only going to say this once.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.340
I'm aware of the lesbian situation.

19:52.370 --> 19:55.510
In fact, I myself am pro lesbo.

19:55.540 --> 19:59.040
But from this day forward,
the word lesbian and my wife

19:59.070 --> 20:03.420
will not be uttered in the same
sentence in this house ever again.

20:03.450 --> 20:04.750
Understood?

20:04.770 --> 20:06.580
- Got it.
- Got it.

20:06.610 --> 20:09.230
But what if we use her first name?

20:09.260 --> 20:11.210
Just kidding.
Kidding.

20:11.230 --> 20:12.640
Hello, boys.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.440
- Hey!
- Hey, honey.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.730
Hey, lou, I brought some cake!

20:15.360 --> 20:16.200
Nice!

20:16.220 --> 20:20.280
I thought that maybe you guys needed something
to soak up the copious amounts of booze

20:20.310 --> 20:22.630
that you consumed last night, and

20:22.670 --> 20:25.720
whoever tells me who left damian drunk

20:25.750 --> 20:29.010
in my elevator in his
underwear gets the first piece.

20:29.030 --> 20:29.670
Ma...

20:29.700 --> 20:33.780
No, you could have caught an pneumonia.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

20:34.430 --> 20:35.260
- It was lou.
- Lou.

20:35.290 --> 20:36.980
- Thank you!
- Oh, man!

20:37.010 --> 20:40.520
You know, it's ok, I'll cut it up
for when you guys come back, ok?

20:40.550 --> 20:41.530
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait,

20:41.570 --> 20:44.240
I want to get a picture of
you in your little fire pants!

20:44.270 --> 20:46.020
Wait!
Hold on!Hold on, hold on!

20:46.060 --> 20:48.280
Oh, damn it!

20:49.280 --> 20:50.700
Brand new!

20:50.730 --> 20:52.480
Come on, guys, hurry up.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.530
Hey, listen.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.960
We have a situation with katie, but, um,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.620
you have to go, so I'm going to wait
here and we can talk about it later.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.810
Honey, it's-you can't be here,
because we're on our way to a fire,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.800
a there's a new regulation
that when we're at a fire,

21:05.830 --> 21:07.810
nobody is allowed in the firehouse at all.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.260
So you're gonna have to come back.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.020
- When did that happen?
- Yeah, tommy, when did that happen?

21:12.040 --> 21:14.880
It was a memo that I saw.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.540
I'm gonna wait in the kitchen.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.340
OK.

21:18.370 --> 21:21.990
- What is wrong with you?
- Just thinking of safety first, honey.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.460
Forget that I even asked.

21:24.470 --> 21:26.010
- Get in the truck.
- Yeah.

22:07.180 --> 22:09.180
Hello.

22:09.210 --> 22:10.780
Hi.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.780
Well, I was just-

22:17.810 --> 22:20.180
I brought this cake here,

22:20.210 --> 22:23.820
and I was going to cut it up for the boys,

22:23.840 --> 22:25.590
for when they came back. And you know,

22:25.610 --> 22:27.800
lou keeps this special
cake knife in the pantry

22:27.820 --> 22:29.460
'cause he doesn't want it to get lost or,

22:29.480 --> 22:31.390
you know, used for something else.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.900
You know how crazy he is about cake.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.640
So that'S...

22:37.660 --> 22:39.530
what I was doing.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.440
Ok.

22:49.510 --> 22:51.780
It's nice to see you, too.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.230
Jesus christ.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.640
You goddamned chump.

23:02.460 --> 23:06.630
Lou keeps the good coffee hidden in
the other pantry in a special spot.

23:06.670 --> 23:10.520
He doesn't want tommy and the guys using
the regular crap the other guys use.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.900
And did I-did you say something?

23:12.930 --> 23:14.620
I thought that you had said something?

23:14.650 --> 23:16.890
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

23:16.920 --> 23:20.560
- No.
- Oh, ok.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.390
Mmm, that is good.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.870
You just texted me.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.460
Yes, I did.

25:08.660 --> 25:11.550
You know what, I totally agree with you.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.760
This is ridiculous.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.030
Good, ok.

25:23.090 --> 25:25.070
Um, so how is damian?

25:25.100 --> 25:27.840
He is fantastic.

25:27.860 --> 25:32.350
- Katie?
- Oh, she's great. Great.

25:32.370 --> 25:34.990
Yeah, you must be nervous
about, you know, him becoming-

25:35.010 --> 25:37.460
Oh, god, it is...

25:37.480 --> 25:39.140
so nerve-wracking.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.920
But, you know, it's what he wants, so...

25:41.940 --> 25:45.340
You know, I could only imagine.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.540
How's the baby?

25:47.560 --> 25:50.450
Oh, the baby's fine.

25:57.780 --> 26:00.380
Ok, so what just happened, what was that?

26:01.220 --> 26:03.530
That-that look on your face.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.020
What, did I have a look?

26:05.040 --> 26:06.800
Yeah.

26:09.700 --> 26:14.540
You know what, it was
probably the look of, um,

26:14.570 --> 26:16.280
disbelief.

26:17.220 --> 26:18.640
You lost me.

26:18.670 --> 26:23.710
Yeah, it was disbelief
in reaction to that, uh,

26:23.740 --> 26:28.260
strange little smile that crossed your
face when I asked you about the baby.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.520
Don't even try to act like you didn't have

26:31.540 --> 26:34.180
a little smile on your sour little puss

26:34.200 --> 26:36.480
before you answered my
question about the baby.

26:36.500 --> 26:40.430
I don't even know why I
bother to be nice to you.

26:40.450 --> 26:42.450
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.290
Was that you being nice to me?

26:44.320 --> 26:46.740
Why don't you go to hell, janet?

26:46.760 --> 26:49.630
Aren't you already there?

27:15.340 --> 27:18.200
You spelled it wrong.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.110
- Hey!
- Hey.

27:25.130 --> 27:26.640
Hi, ladies.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.810
Wow.
Fancy meeting you two here.

27:28.830 --> 27:30.950
What are the odds that you'd be
here at exactly the same time, huh?

27:30.970 --> 27:33.100
That's really-ha ha.

27:33.130 --> 27:35.450
I'm not interrupting
something, am I?'Cause...

27:35.480 --> 27:37.770
- No.
- Oh, good, good.

27:37.790 --> 27:42.390
Oh, hey, is that the new cell phone
everyone's been talking about?That's awesome.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.010
What's a cunf?

27:53.070 --> 27:56.100
I, uh, just came by to
say hi to the guys, so...

27:56.120 --> 27:58.370
I'm actually late.
I'm gonna...

27:58.390 --> 28:02.250
I gotta pick up my watch.
I left it at the, uh...

28:02.280 --> 28:03.910
it's good to see you both, though.

28:03.940 --> 28:05.950
You look great.
Both of you.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.510
Oh, hey, I'm glad you're feeling better.

28:08.540 --> 28:10.890
Thanks.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.080
The correct spelling?

28:39.060 --> 28:42.240
If you wanted my husband so badly,

28:42.270 --> 28:44.800
why haven't you just taken him?

28:49.650 --> 28:52.950
If you want him so badly,

28:52.980 --> 28:56.930
how come you haven't taken him back?

29:10.960 --> 29:12.780
Guys!
Hey, listen!

29:12.810 --> 29:15.390
All right, both of the broads are still
here, they gotta be in the building.

29:16.390 --> 29:17.310
Listen to me, guys!

29:17.330 --> 29:19.160
Hey, hey!

29:19.190 --> 29:21.410
- This is private!
- Not anymore.

29:27.370 --> 29:28.570
Get out.

29:28.590 --> 29:31.590
We just came for the cake.

29:31.610 --> 29:34.720
No, seriously, get out.

29:42.020 --> 29:44.780
You know, not for nothing, but

29:44.810 --> 29:48.510
technically, I'm in charge here.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.560
Tommy!

30:24.580 --> 30:26.270
Hey.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.350
You-you guys want some coffee?

30:37.180 --> 30:39.110
No.

30:51.490 --> 30:53.470
What...

30:54.330 --> 30:57.400
we, you know...

30:57.430 --> 31:00.900
we all know what we all, you know,

31:00.940 --> 31:03.940
we talked about this.
We-you know, I know that

31:03.970 --> 31:06.720
I have nothing to feel

31:06.750 --> 31:09.220
guilty or even

31:09.260 --> 31:11.490
defensive, is, uh,

31:11.520 --> 31:14.800
because you know, you and i

31:14.830 --> 31:17.760
talked, and you and I, it was...

31:17.790 --> 31:21.070
we all, you know, agreed on this whole-

31:21.100 --> 31:22.990
there was never a same day thing,

31:23.020 --> 31:27.100
everybody was an individual, um, thing.

31:27.130 --> 31:29.650
And, you know, and

31:29.670 --> 31:30.790
no strings.

31:30.820 --> 31:33.490
- We all-we all-
- Just stop.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.230
- I'm just trying to remind all of us-
- Shut up.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.190
No strings.

31:41.220 --> 31:45.490
There are very definite strings.

31:45.530 --> 31:47.350
Ok.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.200
Would you agree?

31:49.230 --> 31:51.260
I would agree.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.890
I would agree that there are now

31:53.910 --> 31:59.460
very definite previously unattached strings.

31:59.490 --> 32:04.140
If you want to be a monday morning quarterback
- Just...

32:04.970 --> 32:10.590
as far as I'm concerned,
it is either her or me.

32:10.610 --> 32:14.260
I think that's fair.

32:18.560 --> 32:22.910
You know what, um, I
either want a real marriage

32:22.940 --> 32:24.800
or nothing at all.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.220
Ok, because this little charade,

32:27.250 --> 32:28.720
I'm done with.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.640
I'm sorry, what?
What did you say?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.890
Did you just, uh,

32:35.910 --> 32:37.790
call me a charade?
Am I a charade?

32:37.820 --> 32:39.680
- She didn't say that.
- Is that what you're saying?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.830
- She was jut talking about all of...
- Tommy, just make a decision.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.300
Because I have a question for you.

32:43.330 --> 32:45.270
You better hold me back!

32:45.300 --> 32:48.340
Are you trying to say that me
and tommy are some sort of a game?

32:48.360 --> 32:49.450
A game to you, huh?

32:49.470 --> 32:51.010
Tommy, just make a decision.

32:51.030 --> 32:54.320
- Answer me!
- Oh, my god!You don't shut up.

32:54.350 --> 32:56.350
Yes, yes, it is a goddamn game.

32:56.380 --> 33:00.350
You, me, him, us, this whole
goddamn thing, and now the jig is up.

33:01.460 --> 33:03.510
Get off me!

33:04.190 --> 33:05.900
- Honey...
- I'm leaving.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.510
Oh, no, you're not!
I'm leaving!

33:07.540 --> 33:08.650
Hey!

33:08.670 --> 33:09.920
I'm leaving!

33:14.210 --> 33:15.695
Wait!

33:15.730 --> 33:17.180
Oh, shit!

33:18.400 --> 33:19.470
Seriously?

33:29.500 --> 33:32.380
- Cunf?
- Cunf.

33:34.090 --> 33:36.300
What do you think she meant by that?

33:40.860 --> 33:42.190
Cake?

33:42.220 --> 33:44.320
No.

33:44.340 --> 33:46.480
- Scissors?
- No.

35:33.260 --> 35:34.600
watch out!

37:04.700 --> 37:06.110
get down!

37:20.020 --> 37:22.300
all right all right there you go.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.880
Come on, mike.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.230
gotcha.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.290
Nice, nice!

38:25.320 --> 38:26.440
That's it, kid, get it out.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.970
Get it all out.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.830
- I feel like soup.
- Yeah, I'm in.

38:29.870 --> 38:31.130
- Me, too.
- Chunky?

38:31.160 --> 38:33.510
- Very chunky.
- Chunky soup all around.

38:33.540 --> 38:34.700
Hey, hey, hey!

38:35.220 --> 38:36.530
I need to get in there!

38:36.560 --> 38:37.460
The building is gone, ma'am.

38:37.490 --> 38:40.050
Not the first floor, I can see my window.

38:40.780 --> 38:43.050
Jesus christ, you're gorgeous.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, just relax.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.060
- Do you have a key to the inside?
- Yes.

38:49.090 --> 38:52.020
Whoa, easy, easy, easy!

38:54.390 --> 38:56.470
Jesus christ, mike, come on!

38:56.500 --> 38:58.560
Get your ass up and get here out of there!

39:04.610 --> 39:07.030
The back!
Check the back!

39:07.690 --> 39:08.720
Come on.

39:09.820 --> 39:12.840
Italian 3l, I need a
second alarm on this box.

39:12.860 --> 39:14.660
Let's move.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.800
Over here.

39:21.330 --> 39:23.060
We're gonna need a line, guys.

39:27.700 --> 39:28.860
Everybody's all right?

39:28.870 --> 39:30.190
- This ain't happening.
- Let's go around.

39:30.210 --> 39:32.500
Hey, chief, we couldn't make the rail.
We're coming back around.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.750
Copy, fall back.
Everybody fall back.

39:35.770 --> 39:38.440
I thought we had everyone out.
You guys check your whole floor?

39:38.470 --> 39:40.220
Shit, yeah.
She said she was on the first.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.170
Damian and I swept the
first floor, it was empty.

39:42.190 --> 39:43.840
Yeah, well, no one's
coming out of there alive.

39:43.870 --> 39:46.210
Son of a bitch!
Jesus christ.

39:47.570 --> 39:48.610
You ok, tommy?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.540
Ah, I feel like I've been neutered.

39:50.570 --> 39:51.960
About time.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.460
Holy shit, it was hot in there.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.250
Thanks, guys, I'm all set.

39:59.250 --> 40:01.530
That was awesome.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.350
I wonder what the hell was in that box.

40:09.370 --> 40:11.400
Probably my balls.

40:11.420 --> 40:15.540
No, if they were your balls,
she wouldn't need a box that big.

40:23.030 --> 40:24.330
Walk it off, man.
