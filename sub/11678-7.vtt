I wish I could have seen it. So you went
right in the car andyou took herpurse?

27:16.396 --> 27:19.661
- You should have seen her face
when I opened the door.
- Cops came later, man.

27:19.732 --> 27:23.668
They were all over the street, asking
questions for hours, trying to find the lady.

27:23.736 --> 27:27.103
Oh, you know, Diego's right, of course.

27:27.173 --> 27:29.903

He calls the cops, he talks to the neighbor,
he meets with them.

- I hear he's thinking about
getting outside security too.
- Sounds like a problem.

and Concha will come after both of us.

Militaryfirebombs are typically...

29:57.250 --> 29:58.911
white phosphorus
or chlorine trifluoride.

29:58.986 --> 30:00.920
These are remarkably effective...

30:00.988 --> 30:03.388
but they're also unstable,
lethally toxic...

30:03.457 --> 30:05.550
and hard to find
at the grocery store.

30:05.625 --> 30:08.150
The main ingredient in a homemade
firebomb, on the other hand...

30:08.228 --> 30:10.162
is Styrofoam.
