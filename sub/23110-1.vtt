00:31.168 --> 00:35.210
END OF THE SEASON

00:37.501 --> 00:40.501
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

00:40.793 --> 00:42.918
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

00:45.418 --> 00:49.251
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses.

00:49.501 --> 00:51.918
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

00:52.335 --> 00:56.376
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

00:56.751 --> 01:00.710
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power...

03:25.210 --> 03:28.960
<i>Lines 125 and 126...</i>

04:24.668 --> 04:28.001
This is the locker room,
you'll get your own locker.

04:28.251 --> 04:31.085
We're lucky,
that's Mr. Becker.

04:31.335 --> 04:32.543
That is Mr. Dolmogan.

04:33.001 --> 04:34.543
Dolmadjan.

04:35.751 --> 04:36.585
Barat.

04:37.251 --> 04:38.793
Becker.

04:39.251 --> 04:42.626
You two will be
on the nightshift together.

04:42.876 --> 04:46.793
There's not much training needed.
Your new co-worker is an ex-cop.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.835
We'll be fine.

04:54.543 --> 04:56.585
I hope so, gentlemen.

04:56.876 --> 05:00.210
So, if there's nothing else...
Then I will leave you alone.

05:07.501 --> 05:09.168
I'm going to the kennel.

05:09.418 --> 05:10.418
Jenelle? Who's that?

05:12.460 --> 05:14.418
Down the steps, to the left.

05:24.001 --> 05:25.960
Yes! Come here!

05:26.710 --> 05:29.168
Come here, my friend!

05:37.876 --> 05:39.168
Quiet!

06:00.710 --> 06:02.668
Quiet, Lemmy!
Be quiet!

06:05.835 --> 06:07.793
I don't know.

06:08.043 --> 06:11.585
Why should I beat around
the bush, Ms. Pelzer?

06:11.876 --> 06:16.043
You have gorgeous eyes.
But I also have eyes, everywhere.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.585
Just give it up
and give it back!

06:18.835 --> 06:21.585
Why?
What should I even pocket here?

06:22.501 --> 06:24.585
It's not the end of the world, right?

06:24.835 --> 06:26.043
What's this all about?

06:26.293 --> 06:29.460
I am to believe you,
but I am not convinced.

06:29.710 --> 06:31.501
Are you an ass, or what?

06:31.751 --> 06:32.876
Come on, Lemmy!

06:33.126 --> 06:34.835
Ah, Mr. Becker!

06:35.085 --> 06:38.251
Fine, if you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.001
Becker.

06:47.460 --> 06:48.793
And you?

06:49.751 --> 06:51.335
Who are you again?

06:52.043 --> 06:54.001
That's Lemmy.

06:54.251 --> 06:55.501
Lemmy?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.168
Well, aren't you a capital fellow!

07:06.293 --> 07:09.501
I'd better get moving,
otherwise that ass'll fire me.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.876
Yeah, I'd better be off too.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.293
Go in there, you capital fellow!

07:28.335 --> 07:29.960
I'm leaving.

07:56.126 --> 08:00.001
Here's the bedroom,
I sleep in here. Not you.

08:00.251 --> 08:01.168
Come.

08:04.626 --> 08:06.585
This is the living room.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.460
You can sleep here.

08:10.835 --> 08:12.626
Here's the bathroom.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.626
Yeah, whatever.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.835
Here's the kitchen.

08:17.251 --> 08:18.210
Are you hungry?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.668
Come on, let's take a look.

09:53.876 --> 09:56.585
23.48 euro.
Payback? EC?

10:07.585 --> 10:09.543
Could you put that back please?

10:11.835 --> 10:13.543
21.89 euro.

10:13.793 --> 10:15.751
Yeah, got it.

10:42.043 --> 10:45.960
Here you gotta lock it twice.
Faulty contact in the electronics.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.085
I forgot mine inside.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.626
- Looks like a Christmas party.
- Yes.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.335
But not ours.

11:31.376 --> 11:33.293
Be careful up there.

11:33.543 --> 11:35.876
They recently tried
to jump the fence.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.751
Probably some
Turks or something.

11:39.876 --> 11:40.918
Nothing against you.

11:42.418 --> 11:44.168
I'm not Turkish,
I'm Armenian.

11:46.418 --> 11:48.710
Anyway, be on your toes.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.751
What else is going on?

11:53.585 --> 11:56.085
I thought, I'll celebrate my new job.

12:02.501 --> 12:04.168
I'm cold.

12:12.001 --> 12:13.126
Come!

12:18.918 --> 12:20.876
So?
Are you in?

12:23.126 --> 12:24.376
Don't know yet.

12:24.626 --> 12:28.751
I asked the cleaning ladies.
There's a place open around the corner.

12:29.543 --> 12:33.376
The really cute one
might join us later.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.543
Ah, understand.

12:45.251 --> 12:47.210
You don't understand anything.

12:47.668 --> 12:49.501
That's over.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.168
- So?
- What?

13:00.168 --> 13:02.126
Are you coming or not?

13:03.835 --> 13:05.126
Maybe for a minute.

13:09.293 --> 13:12.043
Oh, man!
I hit orange...

13:22.001 --> 13:24.168
Don't you wanna get rid of those?

13:24.460 --> 13:25.876
The tattoos?

13:26.126 --> 13:27.126
With lasers.

13:29.918 --> 13:33.293
Too expensive.
Can't we just sit here?

13:45.376 --> 13:48.043
It's not polite,
if you don't go along.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.335
Looky there.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.293
Ok! I'll catch up with you!

13:57.543 --> 13:58.585
Hello!

13:59.376 --> 14:00.626
Hello!

14:03.876 --> 14:07.293
Frank?
Can you make me a Southern & Sprite?

14:10.543 --> 14:12.876
And?
Where is Lenny?

14:13.418 --> 14:14.626
Lemmy.

14:15.293 --> 14:16.585
In his cage.

14:20.710 --> 14:21.835
Thanks.

14:24.918 --> 14:26.043
Cheers!

14:33.418 --> 14:36.668
She was naked on the bed.
I said: let's go to the precinct!

14:36.918 --> 14:40.543
And she says, I can't find my pants.
Me and my colleagues looked for 'em.

14:40.793 --> 14:43.210
Her clothes were gone.
She didn't wanna put anything else on.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.751
It wasn't her apartment,
somehow made sense...

14:46.001 --> 14:48.251
Wow, you really know women.

14:48.501 --> 14:49.585
Hey, watch it!

14:49.835 --> 14:53.043
Knowing women is a good thing.
Three shots please.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.001
- That sounds gay.
- No.

14:55.251 --> 14:56.668
Becker! Say something!

14:56.918 --> 14:58.501
No clue.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.585
Here, come on.
President or asshole.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.668
Asshole.
I'm fine with it.

15:03.418 --> 15:04.960
I don't believe it.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.501
Down the hatch!

15:07.501 --> 15:09.460
- Right here.
- What happened with the pants?

15:09.710 --> 15:12.085
- I bought her panties.
- With your money?

15:12.335 --> 15:14.168
They paid me back.
“Increased work expenditure.”

15:14.418 --> 15:16.376
Here's to German bureaucracy!

15:16.626 --> 15:18.751
Germany, Germany!

15:19.001 --> 15:20.751
The little Nazi!

15:21.918 --> 15:23.876
What aren't you a cop anymore?

15:24.126 --> 15:25.460
Long story.

15:25.710 --> 15:28.710
Let's talk about something more pleasant,
love, women...

15:30.543 --> 15:32.418
You can't change the system.

15:33.001 --> 15:34.001
Racist!

15:34.251 --> 15:38.835
But better here than anywhere else.
No rights in their country.

15:39.085 --> 15:41.418
Don't talk about us!
We can hear you!

15:41.668 --> 15:42.960
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.251
That's why it was an honor,
serving the country, no shit!

15:46.501 --> 15:47.460
Little Nazi!

15:47.710 --> 15:50.335
- Shut up?
- We don't want no trouble here!

15:50.585 --> 15:51.835
Gutless sonofabitch!

15:52.251 --> 15:54.751
- Fuck!
- What did you say, asshole?

15:55.001 --> 15:56.585
- What do you want?
- Fuck you!

15:56.835 --> 15:59.293
- What's up?
- Barat, stop it!

15:59.543 --> 16:02.751
- I'll fuck you up!
- Fuck off, damn Turk!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.793
Stop it!
enough!

16:12.543 --> 16:15.001
Leave him alone!

16:25.751 --> 16:27.460
Leave him alone!

16:36.335 --> 16:38.460
Becker, no!

16:48.751 --> 16:50.710
So we're the assholes?

16:51.376 --> 16:52.751
They started it!

16:53.001 --> 16:55.501
I couldn't give a shit,
who started what.

16:55.793 --> 16:57.585
If you fight, you're out.

16:57.835 --> 17:01.126
It's my bar,
and that's how it's done!

17:01.918 --> 17:04.667
- Just one after the hubbub!
- Nah.

17:05.335 --> 17:06.585
I'll pay for it!

17:06.835 --> 17:09.085
No, get lost
or I'll call the cops!

17:42.126 --> 17:43.460
This is my stop.

17:51.085 --> 17:53.043
Are you coming?

18:25.585 --> 18:27.543
Now the boots.

19:19.085 --> 19:21.043
Was a bit heavy, huh?

19:23.210 --> 19:24.168
Yeah.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.210
Might have been a while, huh?

19:33.918 --> 19:35.001
Yeah.

19:52.751 --> 19:53.793
Who's there?

19:54.043 --> 19:58.126
<i>You didn't come home last night.
Where are you?</i>

19:58.543 --> 20:00.168
What do you want?

20:02.543 --> 20:04.251
Is something wrong?

20:04.501 --> 20:05.668
No.

20:06.793 --> 20:09.293
- Hello, darling!
- Hello!

20:11.835 --> 20:13.168
You have a kid.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.168
So?

20:18.293 --> 20:20.085
- Cornflakes?
- Yes, please.

20:20.335 --> 20:22.960
- Were you at Dennis'?
- Yes.

20:25.126 --> 20:26.626
Don't you have to go?

20:27.460 --> 20:28.835
I'll shove off.

20:57.668 --> 20:59.126
Are you ok?

21:05.751 --> 21:07.001
What an asshole!

21:08.876 --> 21:10.210
Want me to call the cops?

21:12.710 --> 21:14.001
I'm ok.

21:15.293 --> 21:16.918
Doesn't look like it.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.751
Worry about your own shit!

21:32.251 --> 21:34.543
What's up, bud?
Still thirsty?

21:35.043 --> 21:37.293
I'm alright.

21:37.626 --> 21:40.168
- Quite the colorful evening.
- Yeah.

21:41.585 --> 21:42.960
Say...

21:44.251 --> 21:46.085
Can you do me a favor?

21:46.710 --> 21:48.543
Want me to fuck Rita for you?

21:53.210 --> 21:54.876
Sorry,
What's up?

21:59.918 --> 22:02.876
I need a name to this license plate.

22:03.126 --> 22:05.710
Maybe you can ask
one of you ex-colleagues.

22:07.251 --> 22:08.376
What about?

22:08.626 --> 22:11.460
Becker, step into my office.

22:11.710 --> 22:12.585
Yes.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.876
It's private.

22:17.126 --> 22:19.876
- I don't do anything illegal.
- No.

22:23.835 --> 22:25.126
Thanks.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.543
Ah, Becker.
One moment.

22:37.876 --> 22:38.876
So.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.418
Better to be on the safe side.

22:42.376 --> 22:44.543
You know.
I am late.

22:44.793 --> 22:47.085
Holiday stress.
Come along.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.835
- Something up with your leg?
- Nah, it's fine.

22:52.085 --> 22:54.751
Sick leave is the last thing I need.

22:55.001 --> 22:57.626
Filling a night shift
during the holidays...

22:57.918 --> 23:00.126
How's it going with Dolmodan?

23:00.668 --> 23:02.001
He's holding up.

23:05.460 --> 23:09.543
Good.
About the cleaning lady, Rita Pelzer.

23:10.710 --> 23:13.668
I don't know what you think you saw.

23:14.418 --> 23:18.126
You should keep an eye on Ms. Pelzer.

23:19.793 --> 23:23.085
Here's a small Christmas gift
from the company.

23:24.293 --> 23:25.876
What do you got there again?

23:26.335 --> 23:27.793
Just a bump.

23:28.751 --> 23:32.418
Jesus, Becker.
This is a real chance for you.

23:32.668 --> 23:34.335
Don't overplay your hand.

23:35.001 --> 23:38.460
I can not afford to have my guards
look like brawlers.

23:39.210 --> 23:42.335
You're just the nightshift, but still.

23:42.585 --> 23:45.126
I don't think Rita pocketed anything.

23:45.376 --> 23:49.126
And I don't think you are in a position
to assess the situation.

23:49.668 --> 23:54.168
Watch yourself, otherwise
your time here'll be up real quick.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.168
Merry Christmas.

23:59.001 --> 24:00.960
Hello everybody!

24:01.293 --> 24:03.251
Sorry, that I'm a bit late...

24:14.835 --> 24:16.293
The bag, please.

24:26.043 --> 24:27.126
Next.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.168
Merry Christmas.

24:52.168 --> 24:53.918
Hey, Becker!

24:55.001 --> 24:56.168
How are you?

24:56.418 --> 24:57.501
Fine.

24:58.085 --> 25:00.460
I just wanted to drop something off.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.460
That's really nice!

25:03.126 --> 25:04.543
And outside?

25:05.126 --> 25:07.085
Drugs or something?

25:08.251 --> 25:10.668
- Still in touch with your old friends?
- No, not anymore.

25:10.918 --> 25:13.085
Good.
That's really good.

25:22.168 --> 25:24.043
Thanks. Means a lot.

25:24.668 --> 25:26.210
Thanks, Becker.

25:28.418 --> 25:30.376
Pretty full tonight.

25:31.043 --> 25:32.626
Not surprising, is it?

27:04.793 --> 27:07.251
Becker, I got something
on those plates.

27:14.501 --> 27:16.501
You owe me a big favor!

27:16.751 --> 27:19.876
My old colleagues had me
jumping through hoops.

27:20.543 --> 27:23.168
The vehicle is registered
to someone named “Dahlmann.”

27:25.293 --> 27:26.543
Benedikt.

27:31.168 --> 27:33.960
- Do you want the address?
- What?

27:34.210 --> 27:35.626
No.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.168
Actually, yeah, what is it?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.710
Simon-Rodenthal-Straße.

27:41.668 --> 27:44.335
- That's up in...
- I know where it is.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.710
You're welcome...

27:52.085 --> 27:53.418
Who is that guy?

27:55.835 --> 27:57.418
That is...

27:57.668 --> 27:59.376
private.
No one.

28:00.251 --> 28:02.793
If I want to know, I'll find out anyway.
I was a cop.

28:03.043 --> 28:05.543
Barat, come on.
Let me pass.

28:07.293 --> 28:09.876
I want to know,
who this Dahlmann guy is.

28:11.085 --> 28:12.043
What?

28:12.293 --> 28:13.751
What do you want from me?

28:14.001 --> 28:15.876
I wanna help you, asshole.

28:16.376 --> 28:18.751
I once got into trouble, too,
but that's all in the past.

28:19.043 --> 28:22.626
What's important is that by God's grace
you don't make the same mistakes.

28:24.001 --> 28:25.626
What happened doesn't matter anymore.

28:28.085 --> 28:29.585
Do-goody bullshit!

28:30.376 --> 28:34.251
You wanna know who Dahlmann is?
I'll tell you.

28:34.501 --> 28:36.668
I took out his wife and kid.

28:36.918 --> 28:38.335
Both of them, 18 years ago.

28:38.585 --> 28:40.543
But that doesn't matter anymore.

29:27.793 --> 29:30.293
- Time to go.
- Yeah.

29:32.418 --> 29:34.793
- I'm going for a coffee.
- Not me, bye.

29:35.043 --> 29:36.543
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:39.376 --> 29:40.543
Bye!

29:54.918 --> 29:55.876
Hello.

29:56.626 --> 29:57.668
Hello.

30:02.835 --> 30:03.960
And now?

30:08.543 --> 30:11.376
I knew a guy with a giant schnauzer.

30:11.626 --> 30:14.418
He always got sausages.

30:14.668 --> 30:16.585
Quit With the bullshit!

30:36.460 --> 30:38.168
Wait.
Wait!

30:41.085 --> 30:42.251
Shit!

30:42.626 --> 30:44.168
What's that?

30:44.751 --> 30:45.876
Oh God!

30:46.751 --> 30:48.168
What the hell?

30:58.626 --> 31:01.335
Stop that shit!

31:02.918 --> 31:05.168
What?
It's my place, isn't it?

31:07.043 --> 31:09.585
Is anything gone?
Did they take anything?

31:09.835 --> 31:11.210
I don't know.

31:11.793 --> 31:13.418
Fucking junkies, or...

31:13.668 --> 31:16.126
Romanians, or whatever.

31:20.793 --> 31:23.376
If you want, you can sleep at my place.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.126
- That's not a good idea.
- Why not?

31:29.126 --> 31:30.876
But I really want it.

31:31.751 --> 31:33.835
I'm not very good with people.

31:35.251 --> 31:38.626
I'm not stupid, Becker.
I know you were in the pen.

31:38.876 --> 31:40.835
- So?
- So nothing!

31:41.085 --> 31:43.793
I don't wanna know about it.
I don't care!

31:44.043 --> 31:45.960
I'm interested in
who you are now!

31:46.210 --> 31:47.376
And who am I now?

31:47.626 --> 31:49.793
A piece of shit is what you are.

31:50.043 --> 31:51.876
Your apartment is shit too.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.876
Your boy?

32:00.210 --> 32:01.501
What about him?

32:01.751 --> 32:03.251
He can't stand me.

32:03.501 --> 32:05.251
He'll get over it.

32:07.376 --> 32:08.918
Well, he likes the dog.

32:14.751 --> 32:16.710
That's a start.

32:18.668 --> 32:20.418
We need dog food.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.876
Not while he's eating!
He doesn't like that.

32:34.668 --> 32:36.918
I can clear out
some space on the shelf.

32:37.168 --> 32:38.293
Nah...

33:00.543 --> 33:03.293
Don't smoke in here!
'Cause of Timo.

33:08.043 --> 33:10.626
He's staying here for now.

33:29.085 --> 33:32.501
BIKER MURDERS 2 IN THE SUBURBS

33:36.835 --> 33:40.210
PRIMARY SUSPECT BECKER APPREHENDED

34:11.043 --> 34:13.168
Mr. Becker?
This way please.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.251
So, Mr. Becker.

34:22.501 --> 34:24.126
I wrote everything down.

34:24.543 --> 34:26.668
We'll verify your statements and...

34:26.960 --> 34:28.085
...Mr. Dahlmann.

34:28.335 --> 34:31.126
Otherwise, it'll stay as
“Charges against an unknown individual.”

34:32.710 --> 34:34.001
And now?

34:34.668 --> 34:37.543
You'll have to fill out the top part
and then sign it,

34:37.793 --> 34:38.876
then that's it.

34:57.168 --> 34:59.126
You are on parole, right?

35:01.376 --> 35:03.251
What's that got to do with anything?

35:05.210 --> 35:07.710
That means you no longer have contact

35:07.960 --> 35:10.876
to biker gangs
or other such groups.

35:11.168 --> 35:12.126
Correct?

35:12.793 --> 35:14.085
Yes, that is correct.

35:17.543 --> 35:20.168
Like I said,
we will verify your statements.

35:21.751 --> 35:23.585
But it may take a while.

35:25.793 --> 35:26.751
Yeah.

35:37.668 --> 35:38.835
So?

35:46.126 --> 35:47.460
Do you think that's right?

35:47.751 --> 35:49.710
Get lost, jerk off!

35:52.043 --> 35:53.543
What are you doing?

36:11.085 --> 36:12.126
Becker!

36:14.085 --> 36:16.335
- Wanna play?
- This is stupid!

36:16.585 --> 36:18.168
We can play against each other.

36:18.418 --> 36:19.376
I wanna play with mom!

36:19.626 --> 36:22.418
We have to go inside.
I'm gonna grab a drink.

36:22.668 --> 36:24.626
- You're staying with Becker, yeah?
- I'm coming with.

36:26.376 --> 36:28.460
- Want anything?
- No.

36:28.793 --> 36:29.835
Come on.

36:56.710 --> 36:57.710
Hello.

37:00.376 --> 37:01.335
Hi.

37:02.585 --> 37:03.626
What are you doing here?

37:06.418 --> 37:07.710
I watched a movie.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.293
Ah, right.

37:12.043 --> 37:13.751
You remember who I am?

37:17.418 --> 37:19.043
Maya?

37:21.001 --> 37:22.668
And you?
What are you doing?

37:24.626 --> 37:25.751
Hello, René.

37:26.543 --> 37:27.751
Hello, Elke.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.126
There you are.

37:32.501 --> 37:33.918
Yeah...

37:35.210 --> 37:37.418
This is Maya.
Elke.

37:37.876 --> 37:39.043
Volker.

37:40.918 --> 37:42.585
Yes.
I am Rita.

37:44.418 --> 37:46.293
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello.

37:47.126 --> 37:48.543
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

37:48.793 --> 37:50.210
This is Timo.

37:52.418 --> 37:53.876
Do you live here?

37:54.251 --> 37:56.460
No, we drove here.

37:58.793 --> 38:00.751
We gotta go in.

38:03.168 --> 38:05.126
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:06.001 --> 38:07.210
Bye.

39:18.376 --> 39:22.168
THIS MUST STOP!
MEET ME AT RESTAURANT CHINATOWN

40:29.126 --> 40:31.376
I don't know, how I...

40:35.126 --> 40:36.960
I am here.

40:37.210 --> 40:39.168
In this dump.
So?

40:41.168 --> 40:42.918
I just wanted to say,

40:43.210 --> 40:45.626
about what I did, I am sorry.

40:46.501 --> 40:49.585
What I did to you and your family.

40:49.835 --> 40:51.543
I am really sorry.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.210
Ah, yeah.
Ok.

40:55.918 --> 40:57.876
Are you doing better?

40:59.001 --> 41:02.168
Now that you said it.
Does it feel good?

41:03.085 --> 41:04.210
No?

41:05.251 --> 41:07.876
And me?
How do you think I feel?

41:08.126 --> 41:10.085
Better? Worse?
The same?

41:11.085 --> 41:12.501
I don't know.

41:14.335 --> 41:15.793
No, you probably don't.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.376
Nobody does.

41:28.793 --> 41:30.251
You don't know me.

41:32.001 --> 41:33.126
No.

41:33.585 --> 41:37.668
Before I met my wife,
I was pretty much an asshole.

41:39.668 --> 41:42.376
I made lots and burned through it all.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.626
For all kinds of shit. It didn't matter,
as long as it kept on going.

41:45.876 --> 41:47.376
And kept going faster.

41:53.168 --> 41:55.085
Then I met Dana.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.585
She was good for me.

42:00.043 --> 42:02.460
She settled me down.
Gave me stability.

42:02.710 --> 42:04.585
Bought a house and then came...

42:07.251 --> 42:08.751
...Lilli.

42:09.210 --> 42:10.585
That was her name.

42:11.668 --> 42:13.835
My daughter's name was Lilli.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.501
I know.

42:24.793 --> 42:26.126
Now she's dead.

42:28.543 --> 42:30.043
Shot dead.

42:30.293 --> 42:32.251
Just like my wife.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.210
And you're sitting there...

42:37.585 --> 42:40.460
and no matter what you say
nothing can change that.

42:40.710 --> 42:42.543
They are both gone.

42:46.168 --> 42:50.085
That's not supposed to feel any better.
And not for you either.

42:53.710 --> 42:56.251
But for you, it's all
a fresh start now, isn't it?

42:58.710 --> 43:00.918
Nice lady.
And the boy...

43:01.835 --> 43:04.168
You have two families now.

43:05.501 --> 43:08.126
Your daughter is all grown up.

43:08.376 --> 43:10.126
And pretty.

43:10.668 --> 43:12.501
She's got nothing to do with this.

43:13.876 --> 43:15.918
Quite popular
with the boys, too.

43:16.168 --> 43:18.710
Buzzing around her
like flies.

43:21.126 --> 43:23.335
You wanna know how old
Lilli would have been?

43:23.585 --> 43:24.543
22.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.210
It was her birthday last week.

43:30.918 --> 43:33.876
Always right before Christmas.
Completely thankless.

43:36.168 --> 43:38.126
She would have been a young lady by now.

43:39.126 --> 43:41.043
We would have been through
with puberty.

43:41.293 --> 43:45.168
Her bitching, her rebelling,
her first boyfriends...

43:48.126 --> 43:50.085
She'd probably be studying now.

43:50.335 --> 43:52.293
She was a very curious child.

43:52.876 --> 43:54.710
She wanted to know everything.

43:57.793 --> 43:59.460
That's probably why she got up
in the first place...

43:59.710 --> 44:02.418
Excuse me,
I need to use the restroom.

44:47.043 --> 44:48.001
Excuse me.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.460
And now?

44:59.585 --> 45:01.543
What are we doing here then?

45:02.960 --> 45:05.418
Talking.
I want a solution.

45:06.460 --> 45:07.710
To what?

45:10.710 --> 45:12.418
I can understand you.

45:13.543 --> 45:16.293
I am not seeking forgiveness.

45:17.376 --> 45:18.335
But my life...

45:18.585 --> 45:20.501
What do you understand?

45:21.293 --> 45:24.335
What do you know about me?
Do you know how I live?

45:25.085 --> 45:26.918
No.
I do not.

45:27.168 --> 45:29.293
Exactly.
You don't know a damn thing.

45:29.543 --> 45:32.460
I can't work,
am in constant need of therapy.

45:32.710 --> 45:35.668
The bank is sucking me dry.
Now they want the house.

45:35.918 --> 45:38.460
- I am sorry.
- You want to begin a new life?

45:38.710 --> 45:41.293
You did your time.
Have a right to it, right?

45:41.543 --> 45:43.376
And what about me?

45:43.710 --> 45:46.001
Why don't I get a new life?

45:47.585 --> 45:49.085
You need to stop with that.

45:49.335 --> 45:51.043
What am I doing?

45:51.585 --> 45:55.293
I know that I can never make up for it.

45:55.543 --> 45:58.335
But I paid my debt.

45:58.585 --> 46:00.793
May I ask a question?

46:01.418 --> 46:03.626
Are you a different person now?

46:07.001 --> 46:10.126
- I think so.
- No, you are not.

46:10.376 --> 46:12.168
That's just what they told you.

46:12.418 --> 46:15.126
You really want to believe that
but you are exactly the same.

46:15.376 --> 46:17.376
But now I have an entirely
different life.

46:17.626 --> 46:20.460
What do you want me to say?
Congratulations?

46:24.335 --> 46:26.126
I think I'm going to leave.

46:26.376 --> 46:29.376
I want us to be clear,
now that we talked.

46:29.835 --> 46:31.210
What should be clear?

46:32.126 --> 46:34.710
I don't want to have to constantly
look over my shoulder.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.293
Oh, but maybe you should!

46:37.543 --> 46:39.085
Take a look back more often.

46:39.335 --> 46:42.293
Don't act like it was
someone else's bad dream.

46:42.585 --> 46:44.085
I am still living in it.

46:45.626 --> 46:48.168
I am also a victim of the past.

46:52.585 --> 46:53.918
Excuse me?

46:55.376 --> 46:57.043
What do you mean?

46:59.668 --> 47:01.626
I just meant...
I...

47:02.126 --> 47:04.710
You weren't the only one
who lost something.

47:06.168 --> 47:09.960
Who do you think you are?
You are a fucking murderer!

47:10.210 --> 47:11.126
Come here!

47:13.418 --> 47:15.043
Leave the restaurant!

47:16.251 --> 47:17.835
I'm leaving.

47:22.501 --> 47:24.126
It's ok.

47:43.126 --> 47:45.085
Who was that?

47:55.043 --> 47:57.751
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No problem.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.793
Do you still wanna stay outside?

48:01.043 --> 48:02.418
No, I am cold.

48:03.001 --> 48:04.960
- Then let's go inside.
- Ok.

48:10.043 --> 48:12.210
We could play a game inside.

48:13.293 --> 48:14.918
Yeah, ok.

48:20.251 --> 48:22.001
Shoot!

48:23.710 --> 48:24.668
Shoot!

48:24.918 --> 48:26.460
Yes, yes! Shoot!

48:28.210 --> 48:30.543
Show me, what I need to do?

48:31.501 --> 48:34.418
Shoot with X, duck with O,
and you run using this.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.668
Hey, what are you doing here?

48:44.918 --> 48:46.251
Playing.

48:46.751 --> 48:49.418
- Who's winning?
- He's even worse than you.

48:51.293 --> 48:53.043
I have to go.

48:56.501 --> 48:57.751
See you.

49:15.085 --> 49:16.668
Do you have to stand there?

49:16.918 --> 49:17.876
Why?

49:18.293 --> 49:20.126
Makes me nervous.
Sit down.

49:28.793 --> 49:30.293
Bon appétit!

49:35.918 --> 49:37.460
What is it?

49:37.751 --> 49:40.085
Currywurst, fries.
Just normal.

49:47.585 --> 49:51.501
That is normal. Healthy food is normal.
Cooked at home.

49:51.751 --> 49:53.668
You need to take care of your body.

49:54.501 --> 49:56.460
That'll kill you eventually.

49:57.418 --> 50:00.543
That piece of pork
will end up clogging your arteries.

50:00.793 --> 50:02.668
And then: poof!

50:04.793 --> 50:08.168
You're just jealous
'cause you aren't allowed to eat it.

50:19.210 --> 50:20.626
I am Armenian.

50:20.876 --> 50:22.751
Christian, not Muslim.

50:24.126 --> 50:26.085
I don't care what you are.

50:27.293 --> 50:29.460
But stay away from my food.

50:49.126 --> 50:50.085
What's the deal?

50:54.251 --> 50:55.960
Have a bad dream?

50:58.001 --> 50:59.710
It'll be fine in a minute.

51:06.668 --> 51:08.626
I saw someone.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.585
And?

51:13.876 --> 51:15.543
It's scaring me.

51:23.793 --> 51:27.960
You are such a powerful,
strong, handsome guy.

51:28.376 --> 51:29.876
You don't get scared.

51:30.126 --> 51:31.543
No.

51:31.793 --> 51:33.376
What is it?

51:36.210 --> 51:37.585
Nothing.

51:39.710 --> 51:41.168
Then fuck me.

52:04.293 --> 52:05.793
Where is mom?

52:06.043 --> 52:07.418
Still asleep.

52:11.918 --> 52:14.543
- Do you want to wake her?
- Ok.

52:14.918 --> 52:16.876
Ask her if she'd like some coffee.

52:24.251 --> 52:25.626
Come here!

52:25.876 --> 52:27.710
- Timo!
- No, boy!

52:28.085 --> 52:29.835
You'll cut yourself.

52:30.085 --> 52:33.376
- We're going to Ms. Yilmaz right now.
- But mom...!

52:34.668 --> 52:36.168
You are going to take care of this.

55:54.168 --> 55:56.043
What are you doing here?

55:56.293 --> 55:58.085
What are you doing here?

55:58.335 --> 56:00.126
I had a bad dream.

56:01.585 --> 56:02.876
And now?

56:06.251 --> 56:07.835
Follow me.

56:22.585 --> 56:23.918
I want one too.

56:24.168 --> 56:26.251
- One what?
- A tattoo.

56:27.751 --> 56:29.626
Can you make me one?

56:30.501 --> 56:32.043
Not one like that.

56:32.293 --> 56:33.793
Something cooler.

56:34.043 --> 56:35.835
What's cool then?

56:36.876 --> 56:37.960
A helicopter.

56:39.418 --> 56:41.710
A helicopter is tricky.

56:42.418 --> 56:44.626
What's going on here?

56:44.876 --> 56:46.043
Nothing!

56:47.001 --> 56:48.710
It doesn't look like nothing.

56:50.751 --> 56:52.376
Are you eating ice cream?

56:52.626 --> 56:54.001
Becker said we could.

56:54.251 --> 56:57.376
He's also drawing a helicopter
on my hand.

56:58.043 --> 57:00.168
- Yes.
- Aren't you cold?

57:01.043 --> 57:02.251
No.

57:03.585 --> 57:04.960
I want something as well.

57:07.835 --> 57:10.210
Now it's my turn
to draw a helicopter.

57:17.043 --> 57:18.460
Done!

57:19.001 --> 57:20.960
You want me to get fat, huh?

57:22.043 --> 57:23.126
Looks cool.

57:48.001 --> 57:49.960
No, I'm on my way in.

57:51.210 --> 57:52.668
Lemmy?

57:54.210 --> 57:55.835
Is Lemmy with you?

57:57.335 --> 57:58.960
He's not coming.

58:00.376 --> 58:01.960
Ok, see you then.

59:12.418 --> 59:14.043
No, don't bother.

59:19.835 --> 59:21.251
Aren't you cold?

59:21.543 --> 59:23.501
Leave Becker alone!

59:30.585 --> 59:32.293
It doesn't work.

59:33.668 --> 59:36.668
Sorry,
we tried, but...

59:39.251 --> 59:41.918
The way I am living here, and...

59:42.335 --> 59:44.751
I know men like you, but...

59:45.793 --> 59:49.085
Timo, go to your room.
Leave us alone.

59:53.668 --> 59:57.543
I don't want to change you,
or put a leash on you, but...

59:58.085 --> 01:00:00.876
I can't have this shit
in my home.

01:00:02.585 --> 01:00:04.251
I have a child.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:07.460
Do you understand?

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:09.418
Yes...

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.126
Can you look at me?

01:03:48.668 --> 01:03:50.335
<i>You have reached the Dahlmanns.</i>

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:54.585
<i>Dana, - Hello! -, Benedikt
and Lilli aren't home right now.</i>

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:57.126
<i>Please leave a message!</i>

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:00.335
Yes, it's Becker.

01:04:01.585 --> 01:04:05.085
Maybe I could help you with the house.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:41.918
Becker.

01:04:50.918 --> 01:04:52.543
You're still around.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.835
Would seem so.

01:05:36.126 --> 01:05:37.376
Pape wants to talk to you.

01:05:41.918 --> 01:05:43.460
What's he talking about?

01:05:44.585 --> 01:05:47.418
It's a warehouse.
Might be something.

01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:49.085
Gotta go quick though.

01:05:49.418 --> 01:05:51.043
Why the rush?

01:05:51.751 --> 01:05:53.585
Need the cash.

01:05:53.835 --> 01:05:57.126
Plus a loan from you.
A lot. And fast.

01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:58.793
A loan?

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.460
What for?

01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:04.168
For something in the past.
My business.

01:06:04.918 --> 01:06:08.085
“My business?”
We don't do that here anymore.

01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:13.251
Do we need to know anything else?

01:06:13.876 --> 01:06:15.751
- You want us to take care of it?
- No.

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:18.085
A debt. From back then.

01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:23.543
Fine.
Then take care of it.

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.960
By the way, we still have something
that belongs to you.

01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:55.710
Hello.

01:08:14.168 --> 01:08:16.126
Are you gonna get that?

01:08:17.251 --> 01:08:18.501
Yes.

01:08:23.335 --> 01:08:24.542
Yeah?

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:27.960
Yeah, calm down!

01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:30.085
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:33.292
Where are you?

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.335
It's fine.

01:08:44.626 --> 01:08:46.585
Him again, or what?

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.542
- I'll take care of it.
- I told you.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.417
- He has to pay and that's it.
- How much?

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.167
26.20 euro.

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.710
What?
Do you want a tip, too?

01:09:09.085 --> 01:09:10.710
A tip...

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.210
Motherfucker!

01:09:13.835 --> 01:09:15.001
That's enough!

01:09:44.126 --> 01:09:45.542
Come in!

01:09:45.835 --> 01:09:48.085
You just don't want to be
alone with her.

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:51.960
Maze is still in the fridge, right?
Come on, in!

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.876
Nah, leave it.
It's fine.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.793
Come on in.

01:09:56.043 --> 01:09:58.001
- Come, why not?
- It's late.

01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:01.085
Everything's done.
It's no work.

01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:02.793
Ok.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.001
You look beat.

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:12.793
Won't Rita let you sleep?

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:17.501
Would it hurt you to say something?

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:19.335
Would it hurt you not to?

01:11:19.585 --> 01:11:21.960
No, it wouldn't.
Here's the money from yesterday. Thanks.

01:11:22.293 --> 01:11:24.043
I'm gonna do my round.

01:11:26.168 --> 01:11:27.251
You starting in the back?

01:11:49.543 --> 01:11:51.210
Stay here!

01:11:52.126 --> 01:11:53.668
<i>Becker?</i>

01:11:54.793 --> 01:11:55.751
Listening.

01:11:56.001 --> 01:11:57.085
<i>I'm finished here.</i>

01:11:57.335 --> 01:11:58.418
Where are you?

01:11:58.668 --> 01:11:59.876
<i>In the back. Hall 2.</i>

01:12:00.126 --> 01:12:01.293
Yeah, it's fine.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.751
<i>Becker?</i>

01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:23.251
Yeah, what?

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:26.585
<i>The signal says
the loading zone isn't secure.</i>

01:12:26.835 --> 01:12:29.918
That's the faulty contact.
I'll take care of it.

01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:31.376
Come on.

01:13:01.876 --> 01:13:02.835
<i>Becker?</i>

01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:05.043
Barat. Barat!

01:13:05.585 --> 01:13:07.918
<i>There's something up here.
Loading zone.</i>

01:13:11.085 --> 01:13:12.835
Get out of there!

01:13:14.043 --> 01:13:15.210
Out of there now!

01:13:28.168 --> 01:13:29.585
No...

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.793
<i>Dr. Hildebrand, you are wanted in the ER.</i>

01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:16.376
Where were you?

01:15:18.835 --> 01:15:20.793
Went to see Barat at the hospital.

01:15:21.043 --> 01:15:23.918
I've been trying to call you
the entire time.

01:15:24.168 --> 01:15:26.168
What the fuck
was that all about?

01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:28.168
I don't know where my cell is.

01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:30.543
What kinda reason is that?

01:15:31.626 --> 01:15:33.293
You got enough.

01:15:33.585 --> 01:15:35.626
Are you nuts?
Give it here...!

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:37.793
What's this?

01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:42.460
So that's it?
Not another word?

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:45.126
You ain't talking to me no more,
or what?

01:15:46.335 --> 01:15:48.335
Where do you wanna go now?

01:15:48.918 --> 01:15:50.793
I have to take care of something.

01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:53.751
I'm just your fuck toy,
or what?

01:15:54.001 --> 01:15:55.626
Rita!

01:15:55.876 --> 01:15:57.626
Let me go!

01:15:57.918 --> 01:16:01.460
You wanna buttfuck your buddies
in the cell block?

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:04.460
Never...!

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:07.460
Never say that to me again!

01:16:10.335 --> 01:16:11.668
Cunt!

01:16:31.918 --> 01:16:34.751
Quite the balls on
your darky friend.

01:16:45.293 --> 01:16:47.668
It'll be coming back around real quick.

01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:49.376
You're gonna pay.

01:16:49.793 --> 01:16:51.376
I know.

01:17:49.585 --> 01:17:51.835
Hello, Rita.
It's me, Becker.

01:17:54.876 --> 01:17:57.876
Yeah, I...
I don't know, I...

01:17:59.668 --> 01:18:01.168
I wanted...

01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:08.876
Can I stop by?

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:13.626
It's fine. On my way.

01:18:13.918 --> 01:18:15.251
See you in a bit.

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:48.585
Rita?

01:19:12.585 --> 01:19:14.293
Rita! Timo!

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:29.710
Excuse me?
Are you an acquaintance of Ms. Pelzer?

01:19:30.626 --> 01:19:31.626
What happened to her?

01:19:31.876 --> 01:19:34.585
There was police, ambulances.
Very loud.

01:19:34.835 --> 01:19:36.793
- Where is she?
- At St. Vinzenz.

01:19:37.043 --> 01:19:39.001
- And the boy?
- Day care.

01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:41.168
- He didn't see a thing.
- Where is he now?

01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:43.126
At my place.

01:19:47.668 --> 01:19:49.710
- Can he stay with you?
- Sure.

01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:52.085
- I need to go to the hospital.
- He can stay as long as is needed.

01:19:52.335 --> 01:19:53.376
Thanks.

01:20:08.751 --> 01:20:10.126
No.

01:20:13.085 --> 01:20:14.376
No.

01:20:17.835 --> 01:20:19.793
Is Timo still with Ms. Yilmaz?

01:20:20.876 --> 01:20:22.835
He didn't see a thing.

01:20:33.335 --> 01:20:35.293
You don't deserve that.

01:20:36.126 --> 01:20:37.710
All this crap.

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:42.876
He tried to rape me.

01:20:51.793 --> 01:20:54.460
I want you to know
who that is.

01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:56.710
No, I don't want to.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.710
I don't want to hear that now.

01:21:11.543 --> 01:21:12.751
Fine.

01:21:17.876 --> 01:21:19.085
I'll...

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:21.960
I'll take care of it.

01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:27.085
I'll be here tomorrow.

01:21:29.668 --> 01:21:30.626
Bright and early.

01:21:32.585 --> 01:21:33.876
Good.

01:21:58.293 --> 01:21:59.626
Dahlmann!

01:22:01.835 --> 01:22:04.293
Dahlmann!
You fucking coward!

01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:09.210
I am here, Dahlmann!

01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:11.251
Dahlmann!

01:22:11.668 --> 01:22:13.293
Come out, coward!

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.001
Do you have any coffee?

01:23:30.918 --> 01:23:32.168
What?

01:23:40.043 --> 01:23:41.668
<i>You have reached the
Dahlmanns.</i>

01:23:41.918 --> 01:23:46.001
<i>Dana, - Hello! -,
Benedikt and Lilli aren't home right now.</i>

01:23:46.251 --> 01:23:48.501
<i>Please leave a message!</i>

01:23:49.668 --> 01:23:51.126
It's Becker.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.751
I'm at a roadhouse.

01:23:54.001 --> 01:23:55.585
“Zur Alten Post.”

01:23:56.251 --> 01:23:58.001
I'll be waiting for you here.

01:23:58.918 --> 01:24:00.543
Do you understand?

01:24:00.793 --> 01:24:02.376
I'm waiting here.

01:24:26.543 --> 01:24:29.793
Better than falling asleep
at the wheel, huh?

01:24:30.168 --> 01:24:31.751
Where do you have to go to?
