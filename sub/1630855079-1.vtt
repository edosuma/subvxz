00:04.004 --> 00:08.049
[***]

00:26.359 --> 00:27.986
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.404
It's gorgeous.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.989
Juliana Piranzi--

00:31.031 --> 00:32.991
last year's design,
but still a classic.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.242
It would be a dream

00:34.284 --> 00:35.827
to walk down the aisle
in a dress like that.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.911
Mm-hmm.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.413
So when is your wedding?

00:38.455 --> 00:40.707
Oh, no, no,
I'm not getting married.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
But I'm guessing you are?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.251
Next Valentine's Day.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.461
Oh, congratulations!

00:44.502 --> 00:45.545
Mm.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.047
You know, there's
a new guide book out

00:47.088 --> 00:48.465
for planning a wedding.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.592
Have you ever read
Tying the Knot?

00:50.633 --> 00:52.427
No, but I probably should.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.387
It's right there
in the window.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.889
It's only been out a few weeks.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.059
It has everything you'd ever
need to know about weddings.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.186
Wow, thanks for the tip.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.688
But how do you know that
if you're not getting married?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.357
I created Tying the Knot.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.859
Can I get a signed copy?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.152
I'd be honored!

01:09.194 --> 01:12.113
[***]

01:20.580 --> 01:23.041
Ohh!

01:23.083 --> 01:24.167
[deep breath]

01:24.209 --> 01:25.835
Ho! [exhales]

01:27.962 --> 01:29.172
[line rings]

01:31.007 --> 01:33.093
Jill, I found our winners.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.720
I'm so sorry, did I wake you?

01:35.762 --> 01:36.888
Yes, I'm still at the office.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.264
Go back to sleep.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.392
I'll see you tomorrow morning
and fill you in.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.602
Okay, bye.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.146
[***]

01:58.493 --> 01:59.536
Morning.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.745
Hello!

02:00.787 --> 02:03.164
I'm dying to know--
who is the lucky couple?

02:03.206 --> 02:05.000
I can't wait to tell you.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.294
Amy Price and Scott Bishop
of New Hampshire.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.671
Good morning, everyone.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.133
Their story is so touching
and heartwarming.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.926
Amy is in grad school.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.970
Scott is in the military.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.638
-[pouring coffee]
-A few years ago,

02:18.680 --> 02:21.558
Scott was wounded in Afghanistan
and broke off their engagement.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.351
He didn't want to be
a burden to Amy.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.394
But...

02:24.436 --> 02:25.687
she wouldn't give up on him,

02:25.729 --> 02:27.981
and two years later,
they're engaged again.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.315
Ohh!

02:29.357 --> 02:31.026
Well, we definitely
have to give them

02:31.067 --> 02:32.277
a wedding
they won't forget.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.737
Yes. And one that will

02:33.778 --> 02:35.280
make every other bride
want to click on our website.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.406
And buy the book.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.532
And buy the book, yes.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.243
Sales have been
a little sluggish.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.579
Ah, well,
sluggish isn't terrible.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.247
Ever the optimist.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.874
I need to work on
being more like that.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.417
In the meantime,

02:47.459 --> 02:50.420
I'm going to email you
the lucky couple's contact info,

02:50.462 --> 02:52.213
and could you please set up
a conference call with them?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.214
Yes, of course.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.174
Thank you.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.510
[***]

02:57.552 --> 02:59.304
I'm still, like,
in a state of disbelief.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.181
Well, you'd better
start believing,

03:01.222 --> 03:02.640
because this
is really happening.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.142
And it's not gonna
cost us anything?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.685
Not a single penny.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.978
All we need from you
is a date for the wedding.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.772
Well...

03:08.813 --> 03:11.691
okay, we-we know
it's short notice, but, um...

03:11.733 --> 03:12.859
we just found out

03:12.901 --> 03:14.694
that Scott's being
transferred to Germany

03:14.736 --> 03:15.612
earlier than we thought.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.863
Oh.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.240
So...

03:19.282 --> 03:20.909
we'd like to be married
next month.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.746
Next month?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.790
We can make that happen.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.124
We sure can.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.793
Uh, have you had a chance
to look at the book

03:29.834 --> 03:31.211
or the website?

03:31.252 --> 03:32.754
Where are we having
this wedding?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.005
Vermont.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.840
"The Wedding Cottage"
in Stony Bridge.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.884
Oh... it's so charming.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.302
It's-It's, um...
it's where

03:39.344 --> 03:40.929
my parents and my grandparents
both got married.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.180
I love that!

03:42.222 --> 03:43.765
Carrying on
family traditions.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.684
All right. Well...

03:45.725 --> 03:48.395
we have a lot to do,
so we will report back soon.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.146
Okay. Um... okay, bye!

03:50.188 --> 03:51.231
Thank you.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.190
[Amy] Thank you so much!

03:52.232 --> 03:53.358
Bye!

03:54.776 --> 03:56.861
Well, we definitely
surprised them.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.822
They weren't the only ones
who were surprised.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.031
We have five weeks!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.158
Do I need to remind you

04:02.200 --> 04:04.160
we once moved an entire wedding
in two days

04:04.202 --> 04:06.371
from Cancun to Hawaii,
to avoid a hurricane?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.789
Do they have hurricanes
in Vermont?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.290
Uh, not this time of year.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.794
At least,
I don't think so.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.383
Have you seen this?

04:18.425 --> 04:20.260
Amy and Scott posted
about the contest

04:20.301 --> 04:21.386
on a military couples website,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.221
and it's blowing up.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.472
So I linked it
to our website,

04:24.514 --> 04:25.974
and we already have
over 5,000 views...

04:27.225 --> 04:28.435
Oh, no.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.145
You have your
"we've got a problem" face on.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.396
What's wrong?

04:31.438 --> 04:32.564
The Wedding Cottage
is what's wrong.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.357
They've disconnected
their phone line

04:34.399 --> 04:36.484
and all of my emails
have bounced back.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.485
What?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.279
How is that even possible?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.114
I don't know.
I just got off the phone

04:41.156 --> 04:42.615
with the third business
in Stony Bridge,

04:42.657 --> 04:44.242
and they all said
the same thing--

04:44.284 --> 04:45.994
the Wedding Cottage
is closed.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.871
Since when?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.290
Since they haven't updated
their website in five years.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.292
This is all my fault.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.003
I was in such a rush
to submit everything,

04:55.045 --> 04:57.756
that I didn't double-check
what the research team compiled,

04:57.797 --> 04:59.591
I just let it go.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.884
Did you find
anything else out?

05:00.925 --> 05:02.135
Like why the cottage closed?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.470
Not really.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.513
Everyone I talked to
was so suspicious of me.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.183
They all thought I was
this real-estate developer.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.392
But I did find out one thing--

05:09.434 --> 05:12.354
the owner of the cottage
is still there.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.106
So what do we do?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.817
So we pretend
like nothing's wrong,

05:17.859 --> 05:19.527
and I head to Vermont.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.695
Okay.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.324
[***]

05:24.366 --> 05:26.868
That is fantastic, Ted!
Thank you so much.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.041
[phone rings]

05:38.088 --> 05:39.172
Hey.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.882
Evan. Great news!

05:40.924 --> 05:43.635
I just got off the phone
with Ted Miller.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.221
He offered you a spot
in the next Collective Show.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.682
The one that's coming up
next month?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.558
[laughs]
Yeah. Like it does every year.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.645
Did he offer you the spot,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.397
or-or did you
have to talk him into it?

05:55.438 --> 05:57.232
Evan, you know
how plum these spots are.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.566
You haven't shown in a while.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
I mean, I had to do
a bit of a song and dance,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.194
but he wants you,

06:01.236 --> 06:02.696
and that's something.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.114
Well, what would be something

06:04.155 --> 06:05.490
is if I actually had
a piece to show.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.159
Well, I thought that's why
you went up to Vermont

06:08.201 --> 06:09.119
in the first place--

06:09.160 --> 06:10.286
to change the scenery,

06:10.328 --> 06:11.663
get your creative juices
flowing again?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.540
That was the idea, but...

06:13.581 --> 06:16.042
Look, I know you can't
force inspiration,

06:16.084 --> 06:17.127
but maybe you could...

06:17.168 --> 06:18.837
shove it a little bit?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.880
It is
the Manhattan Collective Show.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.966
And I would be a fool
not to jump on it.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.134
I-I get it.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.720
Right. So is that a yes?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.597
Yeah. I will try to come up
with one piece to show.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.224
That's right.
One piece is all we need.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.517
You've been up there
for months,

06:32.559 --> 06:33.309
you must have
something brewing.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.937
Not even a cup of coffee.

06:37.981 --> 06:41.985
[***]

06:42.027 --> 06:43.069
[sighs heavily]

06:44.404 --> 06:48.783
[***]

07:05.425 --> 07:06.926
[window whirs]

07:12.140 --> 07:14.225
[***]

07:31.576 --> 07:34.371
[***]

07:34.412 --> 07:36.247
[dejected sigh]

07:41.878 --> 07:43.129
[exhales tensely]

07:43.171 --> 07:45.131
[knocker clapping]

07:49.386 --> 07:51.638
Hello? Is anyone home?

07:52.639 --> 07:53.848
[Evan] Can I help you?

07:53.890 --> 07:54.849
[gasps]

07:56.267 --> 07:58.019
Oh, you scared
the heck out of me!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.312
Are you lost or something?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.523
I... am not sure.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.941
I'm trying to find

08:02.982 --> 08:04.317
the Stony Bridge
Wedding Cottage.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.652
Yeah, this is it.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.822
No, no, it can't be.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.574
This doesn't look anything like
the photos in the guide book.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.284
What guide book?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.661
It doesn't matter,

08:14.703 --> 08:16.204
but this isn't what
it's supposed to look like.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.997
Okay, well, I can't really
help you with that,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.374
but if
you're a real estate agent,

08:19.416 --> 08:20.333
I'm sorry, I'm not interested
in selling.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.794
I'm not a real-estate agent.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.337
[testily]
Okay, then what do you want?

08:24.379 --> 08:25.922
I want to have a wedding here.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.341
Oh.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.676
Well, then,

08:29.718 --> 08:31.886
I'm sorry to disappoint
you and your fiancé,

08:31.928 --> 08:33.304
but you're about
five years too late.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.348
It's not my wedding.
I work in the wedding business.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.435
I publish a wedding guide book
called Tying The Knot.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.354
Maybe you've heard of it?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.023
Okay, never mind.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.191
Okay.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.360
My grandparents are the ones who
used to run the Wedding Cottage,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.362
but they passed some years ago.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.905
I'm so sorry.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.909
Perhaps I could
have a peek inside?

08:54.951 --> 08:59.205
Maybe it's not as bad in there
as it is out here.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.915
You don't seem
to be getting it.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.460
There is no more
"Wedding Cottage".

09:03.501 --> 09:06.087
Mm, technically,
that's not true,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.173
because it's still listed
in our guide book.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.760
Okay, let me put this
a little more clearly--

09:11.801 --> 09:13.553
the Wedding Cottage
is permanently closed.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.388
You understand?

09:15.430 --> 09:18.224
I mean, I... I understand.
I'm just not happy about it.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.392
Well...

09:19.434 --> 09:20.894
Where are you going?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.979
You should also probably
take us out of your guide book.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.231
Do-- Do you live here?

09:26.441 --> 09:27.942
I don't live in the cottage.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.486
I live...

09:29.527 --> 09:30.737
I live back there,

09:30.779 --> 09:32.197
but that's not really
any of your business.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.323
Of course not.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.993
Wow!

09:37.035 --> 09:38.119
[phone rings]

09:40.622 --> 09:43.416
Well...
I made it to Stony Bridge,

09:43.458 --> 09:46.086
and the people here
are very charming.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.754
Are you at the cottage?
What's going on?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.131
See for yourself...

09:51.299 --> 09:52.258
[shutter snaps]

09:52.300 --> 09:53.802
I'm texting you a photo.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.221
[text alert chimes]

09:56.262 --> 09:57.347
Oh...

09:57.389 --> 09:58.556
Pretty sad, isn't it?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.558
Well, maybe it's not
as bad as it looks?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.768
Oh, no, no, no, it is.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.436
Have you seen the inside?

10:03.478 --> 10:04.604
No, I haven't,

10:04.646 --> 10:06.690
because the owner
wouldn't let me.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.857
He's kind of a grouch...

10:07.899 --> 10:09.734
but I've dealt
with grouches before.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.069
So, in the meantime,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.572
could you please look
for another place nearby

10:14.614 --> 10:17.075
that looks the way
this place used to?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.118
That's a joke...

10:18.159 --> 10:19.536
right?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.455
Oh, it is a desperate
attempt at one.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.415
[deep breath]

10:23.456 --> 10:25.041
Bye.

10:30.630 --> 10:36.928
[***]

10:48.440 --> 10:52.360
[***]

10:58.241 --> 11:00.452
[knocking on door]

11:00.493 --> 11:02.871
[sighs]

11:07.208 --> 11:08.668
Hi!

11:08.710 --> 11:10.462
It's just me again.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.922
Sorry to bother you.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.091
I don't think that you are.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.510
What would you like?
I'm really busy.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.220
Okay, then I will
cut to the chase.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.433
I am in a terrible bind,

11:23.475 --> 11:24.684
because I just promised

11:24.726 --> 11:26.186
the winners
of a nationwide contest

11:26.227 --> 11:28.021
that they could have
the wedding of their dreams...

11:28.063 --> 11:29.147
here.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.442
She's in grad school.
He's in the Army.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.818
They'll be shipping off soon.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.321
So, please,
I am begging you...

11:36.363 --> 11:38.365
do not deny them their dreams.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.909
I'm not denying them anything.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.535
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.329
I am proposing

11:44.371 --> 11:47.499
that you let me fix up
the Wedding Cottage.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.708
[sighs]

11:48.750 --> 11:50.418
I walked around the property.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.628
I took peek inside,

11:51.670 --> 11:53.213
and, really, all it needs
is a little TLC.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.006
Okay--

11:55.048 --> 11:56.424
[laughs]
...a lot of TLC,

11:56.466 --> 11:57.717
but, really, all it would take
is some cosmetic work

11:57.759 --> 11:59.594
to make it beautiful again.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.555
I'll do all of the work
at my own expense.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.766
It's basically a win-win
for both of us,

12:04.808 --> 12:07.727
because you can move
out of this place,

12:07.769 --> 12:10.689
if you want,
and back into the main house.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.359
So...
what do you think?

12:14.401 --> 12:17.570
Let me say this as clearly
as I possibly can--

12:17.612 --> 12:19.614
I'm not interested.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.158
So you may as well
really leave this time.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.497
[blurts]
Any chance you'll reconsider?

12:27.539 --> 12:29.165
I am considering
calling the Sheriff.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.752
[thud]

12:32.794 --> 12:34.838
[quietly]
Okay, you made your point.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.173
[calls out]
I'm really leaving this time!

12:38.758 --> 12:41.136
[***]

12:55.483 --> 12:57.819
[***]

13:02.282 --> 13:03.575
Hi.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.910
Sorry to interrupt,
I just need a room for one.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.496
Sure.
How long will you be staying?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.789
I don't know.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.708
It could be a while.
Yet to be determined.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.418
No problem.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.546
We're not too busy these days.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.756
You here on business?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.257
I hope to be.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.967
Have you heard of
the Wedding Cottage?

13:21.009 --> 13:23.845
Of course. But it's been
closed for a while.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.389
Yes, I just found that out
the hard way.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.016
Um, credit card?

13:28.058 --> 13:29.559
-You can tap there.
-Okay.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.144
[beep]

13:31.186 --> 13:32.645
Do you happen to know the guy
who's been living there?

13:32.687 --> 13:33.897
Mm. Not well.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.815
He pretty much
keeps to himself.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.276
I knew his grandmother
quite well, though.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.778
Rose Stanford.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.156
She kept the cottage open
until her health began to fail.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.617
Well, apparently her grandson
has no interest

13:45.658 --> 13:46.826
in carrying on the torch.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.911
Probably not.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.705
I hear
he's some kind of artist.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.499
Pretty ironic.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.833
An artist has no interest

13:53.875 --> 13:55.210
in preserving
the beauty of the cottage?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.961
[sighs]
It'd break Rose's heart

13:57.003 --> 13:58.672
if she saw the state
it was in now.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.382
Do you know

14:00.423 --> 14:01.925
if he's done any work
on the property

14:01.966 --> 14:04.094
since he moved in?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.262
You're not a developer
or real-estate agent, are you?

14:06.304 --> 14:09.265
No, absolutely not a developer.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.851
Um, though that seems to be
on everyone's mind these days,

14:11.893 --> 14:13.019
doesn't it?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.688
Most of us in Stony Bridge

14:14.729 --> 14:16.731
prefer to keep the town
just as it is.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.149
Right.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.401
Come on, I'll show you
to your room.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.862
Here we are.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.698
I hope you'll be comfortable.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.241
It's perfect.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.909
Thank you.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.163
[***]

14:37.836 --> 14:40.088
Hi! Hi.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.800
I realize we didn't get off
to a good start yesterday,

14:43.842 --> 14:46.386
so I thought I'd come by
and re-introduce myself.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.804
I'm Vanessa Doyle.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.974
And I believe you are
Evan Stanford, right?

14:51.016 --> 14:53.059
What did you do?
Did you sleep in your car?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.728
No! No, of course not.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.062
I-I stayed at the B&B.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.897
Oh, and did you know

14:57.939 --> 15:00.233
that the owner of the B&B,
Marilyn Sherwood,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.235
was very good friends
with your grandmother?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.320
I'm sure many people were.
My grandmother grew up here.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.531
These are for you.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.491
What is that?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.118
A... peace offering?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.619
Oh, you mean a bribe?

15:11.661 --> 15:12.912
No!

15:12.954 --> 15:15.582
It's just coffee
and a cinnamon bun.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.375
Homemade at the B&B.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.835
Well, thank you,
but if you don't mind,

15:18.877 --> 15:20.337
I think I'm just gonna
head on into town,

15:20.378 --> 15:22.339
and I'm gonna get my own coffee
with no strings attached.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.758
Uh, you can keep this
either way.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.052
"Either way"?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.762
I just need
two minutes of your time.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.929
I'm gonna save you
the two minutes,

15:29.971 --> 15:31.723
because the answer's still no.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.100
Okay, do you have something
against all weddings,

15:34.142 --> 15:35.602
or is it just something
about the Wedding Cottage?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.062
[sighs] Actually,

15:37.103 --> 15:38.438
I have nothing against
either one of those things.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.106
Okay. So why don't you
just say yes

15:40.148 --> 15:42.609
as a tribute
to your grandparents?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.195
It would only take
a few weeks

15:45.236 --> 15:46.529
for me to spruce up
the cottage,

15:46.571 --> 15:48.656
and it's just one wedding,
and then-- and then,

15:48.698 --> 15:52.160
I will be
out of your life forever.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.536
Ooh, kinda wish you were
out of my life right now.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.121
Yeah, I'm getting that sense,
and I'm sorry.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.040
I realize I'm being
a bit of a pest,

15:57.082 --> 15:59.793
but I do not give up easily.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.461
[mocking] Really?

16:01.503 --> 16:03.046
Okay.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.966
Marilyn-- she showed me
some photos of what this place

16:07.008 --> 16:08.343
looked like
in its heyday.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.344
Yeah

16:09.386 --> 16:10.595
It was magical!

16:10.637 --> 16:12.263
And it deserves to be
brought back to life.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.808
And... And you--
as an artist,

16:14.849 --> 16:15.892
more than most--

16:15.934 --> 16:17.394
should really
appreciate that.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.938
Okay. Listen.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.524
I-- I don't disagree with you.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.567
Okay?
But I came here for two things.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.404
For some peace and quiet,
and to do some work.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.156
And fixing up
the Wedding Cottage

16:30.198 --> 16:31.950
doesn't sound like
either of those things.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.576
Okay, now we're communicating.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.245
So, what if I...

16:35.286 --> 16:37.831
what if I personally
supervise the crew,

16:37.872 --> 16:40.375
and make sure
that you are not disturbed

16:40.417 --> 16:42.711
by any noise at all,
whatsoever?

16:44.212 --> 16:45.463
You're shaking your head. Okay.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.133
And-And I would
bring you coffee every day!

16:48.174 --> 16:50.010
-No.
-And...

16:50.051 --> 16:53.680
And I will
oil your bicycle chain,

16:53.722 --> 16:55.473
uh, once a week.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.851
And... and-and I will
walk your dog.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.310
I don't have a dog.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.979
Okay. Well,
I recommend getting one.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
They're excellent companions.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.024
-I don't want a dog.
-Okay.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.525
Well, the point is,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.694
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to make this work.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.945
Yeah, okay, I understand.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.572
I get it.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.615
My answer's still no.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.367
No, no! Okay, okay.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.370
This wouldn't just be for you
and your grandparents.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.874
This would be for the--
for the whole town!

17:20.915 --> 17:23.335
Don't tell Marilyn
I told you this,

17:23.376 --> 17:26.004
but she could really use
the extra business.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.548
And I'm not sure
if I mentioned this, but...

17:28.590 --> 17:31.593
that very sweet,
young military couple

17:31.634 --> 17:34.304
has their hearts set
on getting married here.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.474
The bride's parents
got married at this cottage,

17:37.515 --> 17:40.143
her grandparents got married
at this cottage.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.271
So, really, all of this
is just steeped in tradition!

17:44.606 --> 17:45.565
That's a good speech.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.108
Thank you.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.902
A little over-the-top,
but I meant every word.

17:48.943 --> 17:49.903
Are you really this desperate?

17:49.944 --> 17:51.446
Yes.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.991
Because the future of
my business depends on it.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.452
Well, I can certainly
understand that feeling.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.622
I'm sorry,
I'm not normally so...

18:00.663 --> 18:01.748
excitable.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.166
Let's hope not.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.085
So do we have a deal?

18:05.126 --> 18:06.836
You really want
to do all of this

18:06.878 --> 18:08.254
just for one wedding?

18:08.296 --> 18:10.548
[heartfelt]
It's worth it for one wedding.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.591
[groans softly]

18:11.633 --> 18:12.676
That sounds exactly like

18:12.717 --> 18:14.260
something my grandmother
would've said.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.515
So is that a yes?

18:23.269 --> 18:24.979
Yeah. Okay, fine,
we have a deal.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.356
Oh! Oh, my goodness! Oh!

18:26.398 --> 18:27.774
Oh, thank you so much.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.608
I'm sorry,
I should shake--

18:28.650 --> 18:29.651
Okay.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.945
[***]

18:31.986 --> 18:33.488
Forgetting something?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.157
A... hug?

18:37.158 --> 18:38.660
No, my morning coffee.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.078
Oh!

18:40.120 --> 18:42.664
Of course.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.209
You don't have to bow.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.795
[chuckles awkwardly]

18:48.837 --> 18:49.838
[squeals]

18:49.879 --> 18:52.257
Yes!

18:56.594 --> 18:57.721
How about you?

18:57.762 --> 18:59.139
How are
the wedding plans coming?

18:59.180 --> 19:01.182
Good.
I spoke with Amy and Scott.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.768
They have decided
on a "rustic country" theme.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
Yellow and orange
for their colors,

19:05.520 --> 19:07.147
and classic rock
for the music.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.481
Oh, that's nice.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.316
And how about publicity?

19:10.358 --> 19:12.485
Any luck getting them booked
on Good Day, America?

19:12.527 --> 19:16.281
Uh, I used all my connections,
but I've hit a brick wall.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.491
I guess hiring a publicist
is out of the question.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.452
Oh, we are already
over-budget.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.078
Right.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.663
Well, I'll try
to call in a few favors.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.124
And let's hope
they owe you big-time.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.209
Hey! You're supposed
to be the optimist.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.004
All right, I'm at my next stop.
I'll talk to you later.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.382
[***]

19:36.259 --> 19:37.302
Hi.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.220
Hi, there.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.847
-Hi.
-How can I help ya?

19:40.889 --> 19:41.973
Uh, I'm Vanessa Doyle.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.516
I'm gonna be doing
a little renovation

19:43.558 --> 19:45.018
over at the Wedding Cottage
on Stony Lane.

19:45.060 --> 19:45.852
Do you know it?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.604
Sure. I got married there.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.397
Great! That's so nice.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.816
Um, I will be needing a painter,

19:51.858 --> 19:53.860
someone to handle
carpentry...

19:53.902 --> 19:55.653
uh, an electrician to check
the wiring and lighting.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.571
What's your time frame?

19:56.613 --> 19:57.405
Four weeks.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.907
[laughs]

19:58.948 --> 20:00.533
Okay, I could make it
four and a half,

20:00.575 --> 20:02.035
if I need to stretch it.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.036
What's your rush?

20:04.996 --> 20:07.082
You do know this is Vermont,
not New York?

20:07.123 --> 20:09.167
Which is where
I'm assuming you're from?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.335
Too pushy?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.795
A little.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.632
People in Vermont
are a little more laid-back.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.300
We don't usually like to rush.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.885
Right.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.805
Well, I need to have
a wedding there in five weeks,

20:21.846 --> 20:23.848
so, any suggestions?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.518
[exhales]
Well, um...

20:26.559 --> 20:28.103
postpone the wedding?

20:29.938 --> 20:32.524
Okay, I'm guessing
that's not an option.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.608
No.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.984
The groom is in the Army.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.528
He'll be overseas
by the end of the month.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.946
Hmm.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.447
Well...

20:39.489 --> 20:42.617
the best contractor around here
is, uh, Daryl Froelich,

20:42.659 --> 20:44.411
but he's usually pretty booked.

20:44.452 --> 20:45.578
Oh.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.871
Um, but you know what?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.916
I bet if you explain to him
your situation,

20:49.958 --> 20:51.543
he'd probably help you out.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.794
He's ex-military himself, so...

20:52.836 --> 20:54.879
let me give you his number.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.881
Thank you so much.

20:57.716 --> 21:01.219
[***]

21:01.261 --> 21:02.721
How's it coming?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.556
So much better than expected!

21:04.597 --> 21:06.766
I called over a dozen
local vendors

21:06.808 --> 21:08.560
and not a single one
put me on hold.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.478
That just doesn't happen
in New York.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.022
[chuckles]

21:12.063 --> 21:14.399
Did you know
that the Wedding Cottage

21:14.441 --> 21:17.068
is one of the oldest
establishments in Stony Bridge?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.653
Well, at least,
it used to be.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.988
I knew it was old,

21:20.030 --> 21:22.282
but I don't know much
about its history.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.616
Oh! Well...

21:23.658 --> 21:25.744
Rose's parents
spent their honeymoon there

21:25.785 --> 21:26.911
in the 1920s,

21:26.953 --> 21:28.997
and then they decided
to buy it

21:29.039 --> 21:32.334
because it reminded them
of an English country cottage.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.668
Mm!

21:33.710 --> 21:35.462
The story goes
that they were so happy there

21:35.503 --> 21:38.465
that they decided to turn it
into a wedding venue

21:38.506 --> 21:40.800
so that other couples
could experience what they had.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.510
Mm, it's really a shame

21:42.552 --> 21:43.928
I can't keep it
in the guide book.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.597
That story would be
great to include.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.099
Mm, it was quite the place
in its time.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.602
People came from all over
to get married there.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.603
It even had a slogan--

21:51.644 --> 21:54.898
"Where happily-ever-after
happens."

21:54.939 --> 21:56.316
I read that on the sign.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.319
And did it prove to be true?

21:59.361 --> 22:00.612
It did for me.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.490
Although I... I lost my husband
a few years ago.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.200
I'm so sorry.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.409
But...

22:06.451 --> 22:08.328
everyone else I know
that got married there

22:08.370 --> 22:09.287
is still together.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.830
Wow.

22:10.872 --> 22:14.417
So, no one in the family
wanted to carry on the business?

22:14.459 --> 22:17.379
No. And so, when Rose passed,
they just closed it up.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.131
And, as you know,
she left it to her grandson.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.716
Right.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.177
Who doesn't seem
to care about it at all.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.888
No, but at least he hasn't
tried to sell it, so...

22:27.847 --> 22:29.641
I was wondering about that.

22:29.683 --> 22:33.103
Mm. Maybe he does have some
affection for it, after all.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.481
[***]

22:45.699 --> 22:47.575
Thank you.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.745
Thanks.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.247
[thump]

22:54.541 --> 22:56.334
[chuckles]

22:56.376 --> 22:58.169
This is just a coincidence,
isn't it?

22:58.211 --> 22:59.212
Of course it is.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.549
All right, I'm just checking.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.259
Are you dining alone?

23:04.300 --> 23:05.760
I was planning to.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.303
[sighs]

23:07.345 --> 23:10.390
Well, since
we are both here alone,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.225
would you care to join me?

23:13.476 --> 23:14.519
No strings attached.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.730
Honest.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.523
I'll have to take
your word for that.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.316
[chuckles]

23:20.358 --> 23:22.819
You know, if you like fish,
the trout here's amazing.

23:22.861 --> 23:24.029
Oh? You come here often?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.822
Two or three times.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.032
Since you've been in town?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.950
Two or three times a week.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.536
You must really love trout.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.204
[chuckles]

23:33.246 --> 23:34.497
Vanessa!

23:34.539 --> 23:35.623
Neil!

23:35.665 --> 23:36.499
Good to see you again.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.625
You too.

23:37.667 --> 23:38.710
Uh, do you know Evan Stanford?

23:38.752 --> 23:40.295
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

23:40.337 --> 23:41.212
This is Neil.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.422
He owns the hardware store.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.174
Did you manage
to get in touch with Daryl?

23:44.215 --> 23:45.508
I did, yes.
Thank you so much.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.801
He's sending a crew tomorrow.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.303
And you were right--

23:48.345 --> 23:49.846
he was very sympathetic
to the cause.

23:49.888 --> 23:50.847
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.724
Enjoy your dinner.

23:52.766 --> 23:53.975
Thank you.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.478
Daryl is the contractor
I hired.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.397
He was on another job,
but he was eager to help.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.816
Although, the rest of his crew
was busy,

24:01.858 --> 24:04.402
so I contacted an electrician
in Bennington,

24:04.444 --> 24:05.904
and, hopefully, he'll be here
by the end of the week.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.280
You got all that done
in one day?

24:07.322 --> 24:08.948
Mm-hmm.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.283
It's kinda my job.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.329
Didn't you tell me
that you were a publisher?

24:14.371 --> 24:16.164
No.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.166
Yeah...

24:18.208 --> 24:19.751
I used to plan weddings,

24:19.793 --> 24:21.753
but I gave it up to start
my new business,

24:21.795 --> 24:23.129
Tying the Knot.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.923
Although, I guess,
technically,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.759
I'm still planning
Amy and Scott's wedding.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.220
You must really like weddings.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.638
I do.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.098
I love weddings.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.849
I'm surprised you don't,

24:34.891 --> 24:36.017
considering
you're practically living

24:36.059 --> 24:37.560
in theWedding Cottage.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.437
It's like I told you before--
I have nothing against them,

24:39.479 --> 24:40.855
it's just not the business
that I wanted to go into.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.775
Right.
So you became an artist.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.276
That's right.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.112
And how is your work going?

24:49.447 --> 24:52.075
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's-it's coming along.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.995
[***]

24:59.833 --> 25:01.960
[saw whirring]

25:02.002 --> 25:02.752
[Daryl] You can end it
right there.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.796
That far?

25:04.838 --> 25:05.964
Yeah, you can end it
right there.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.507
-Perfect, thanks.
-I'm so sorry. So sorry.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.468
Do you think you could ask
your guys to just keep it down?

25:11.678 --> 25:13.304
[whispers] You can't really
do this kind of work

25:13.346 --> 25:14.681
without making
a little bit of noise.

25:16.224 --> 25:17.684
Come on.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.060
Why are we whispering?

25:19.102 --> 25:20.520
Because I kinda promised
the owner of the property,

25:20.562 --> 25:22.272
who happens to live
in that back cottage,

25:22.313 --> 25:24.858
that we wouldn't make any noise.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.985
The cottage
that's 100 yards away,

25:27.027 --> 25:28.319
on the other side
of the pond?

25:28.361 --> 25:30.655
[normal voice]
He can't hear us.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.116
[***]

25:34.200 --> 25:36.327
We're gonna have to lose
all that paper.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.163
You don't have it in the budget
for new wallpaper,

25:38.204 --> 25:39.330
so, what we're gonna do

25:39.372 --> 25:40.832
is we're gonna peel off
this old stuff

25:40.874 --> 25:41.958
and put on
a new coat of paint.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.084
Sounds like a plan.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.544
Watch your step.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.923
[sighs]

25:48.965 --> 25:50.675
Oh, no...

25:50.717 --> 25:52.552
it's gonna be great.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.224
[unconvinced]
It's gonna be great.

25:59.476 --> 26:01.728
[***]

26:03.563 --> 26:05.690
Oh, boy.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.613
[tarp rustles]

26:11.654 --> 26:13.073
Hmm!

26:15.909 --> 26:20.080
[***]

26:21.873 --> 26:24.209
Okay...

26:26.753 --> 26:28.213
[rumbling]

26:28.254 --> 26:30.256
[leaf blower chugging]

26:30.298 --> 26:31.383
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

26:31.424 --> 26:33.093
Ooh!

26:35.303 --> 26:36.221
Um...

26:37.472 --> 26:38.640
What are you doing
with that thing?

26:38.682 --> 26:40.475
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.644
I, uh... I don't know
how to turn it off.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.354
-[shuts off]
-Thank you.

26:44.396 --> 26:47.023
I can't get a gardener here
until next week,

26:47.065 --> 26:48.858
so I thought I'd try
to clean up a bit.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.151
You ever used
a leaf blower before?

26:50.193 --> 26:51.736
No, but I...

26:51.778 --> 26:53.154
[sighs]
It can't be that hard.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.823
Well, it can be a very
dangerous piece of machinery

26:54.864 --> 26:57.200
if you don't know
what you're doing.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.370
All right, I should probably
show you how to use it.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.288
No, I don't want
to interrupt your...

27:02.330 --> 27:03.915
work.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.750
I was just doing
some sketching.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.544
Um...

27:07.585 --> 27:09.796
and, besides, I would not
like to see you lose control

27:09.838 --> 27:10.880
and break a window
or something.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.258
[laughs] Okay.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.176
Well, I mean, I would gladly
accept a lesson

27:15.218 --> 27:16.803
if you have the time.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.096
I can spare
a few more minutes.

27:18.138 --> 27:21.099
First off, it doesn't
go on the ground.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.767
It goes on your back.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.893
[chuckles]

27:23.935 --> 27:24.936
Oh.

27:24.978 --> 27:25.937
See?

27:25.979 --> 27:26.771
All right, here.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.106
Okay-- Oh.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.441
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.234
That's pretty heavy.
You sure you got it?

27:31.276 --> 27:33.820
Yeah. I got this.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.530
-You sure?
-Absolutely. I got it.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.657
Oh! Whoa! [laughs]

27:37.699 --> 27:38.742
Thank you.

27:38.783 --> 27:39.826
Okay.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.079
And you're gonna
want to put these on.

27:43.121 --> 27:43.955
Oh, no, I don't need--

27:43.997 --> 27:45.040
Yep!

27:45.081 --> 27:46.166
Okay...

27:47.751 --> 27:49.085
[motor roars]

27:49.127 --> 27:51.212
[chugging]

27:53.965 --> 27:55.508
Okay, and I just...

27:55.550 --> 27:56.718
[whirring loudly]

27:56.760 --> 27:58.678
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

28:00.013 --> 28:01.765
[indistinct shouting]

28:01.806 --> 28:03.892
[blower roaring]

28:05.101 --> 28:06.144
[blower shuts off]

28:06.186 --> 28:07.270
You want to slow down--

28:07.312 --> 28:08.938
I can't hear you!

28:08.980 --> 28:11.191
[louder]
You want to slow down...

28:11.232 --> 28:12.817
[normal voice]
...and just go nice and easy.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.736
Okay? Take it slow.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.821
Okay, going slow is not a thing
I'm particularly good at.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.031
Yeah, I've noticed!

28:18.073 --> 28:19.240
You're kinda
hurrying around all the time.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.450
So I'm told.
I'm working on it.

28:20.492 --> 28:21.993
You should, 'cause, otherwise,

28:22.035 --> 28:23.078
you're liable to miss out on
a whole bunch of great things,

28:23.119 --> 28:24.537
like...

28:24.579 --> 28:28.333
the smell of fresh-cut grass,
or...

28:28.375 --> 28:30.835
you know, the way leaves change
at the end of the season.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.838
Or someone trying
to work quietly

28:33.880 --> 28:35.298
sitting on a bench.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.633
Sorry. I'm sorry.

28:36.675 --> 28:37.801
Honestly, I didn't even know
you were there.

28:37.842 --> 28:38.927
Yeah, see what I mean?

28:38.968 --> 28:41.346
Okay, you got it now?

28:42.222 --> 28:43.807
You're good.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.684
Okay... nice and slow!

28:45.725 --> 28:46.935
[blower chugs to life]

28:49.562 --> 28:51.106
Nice and slow.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.358
[blower blasting]

28:53.400 --> 28:55.235
No, no, you want to go--

28:55.276 --> 28:57.070
[louder]
You want to go--

28:57.112 --> 28:58.530
What are you doing?
You don't jump!

28:58.571 --> 29:00.156
You don't jump,
you just go--

29:00.198 --> 29:01.449
okay, you don't...

29:06.705 --> 29:07.789
[air blasting]

29:07.831 --> 29:08.873
No, no, no!

29:08.915 --> 29:10.875
Sorry!

29:17.173 --> 29:19.759
[***]

29:28.018 --> 29:29.352
[sighs]

29:31.312 --> 29:33.523
[paper hits floor]

29:33.565 --> 29:35.108
[sighs]

29:40.155 --> 29:42.866
[tools whirring and pounding]

29:42.907 --> 29:45.535
[Vanessa]
Okay, everyone, lunch is ready!

29:48.079 --> 29:49.330
Oh, wow.

29:49.372 --> 29:51.249
Looks like you're cooking
for a small army.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.918
Uh, just a small group
of hard workers

29:53.960 --> 29:55.879
with healthy appetites.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.630
-You want a plate?
-Sure.

29:57.672 --> 29:59.090
Okay.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.508
Um...

30:00.550 --> 30:02.177
I actually got all of the food

30:02.218 --> 30:04.304
at that restaurant where
we had dinner together.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.975
I-I meant where
we bumped into each other.

30:09.017 --> 30:09.809
Yeah.

30:12.687 --> 30:13.688
Oh, that's good.

30:13.730 --> 30:14.773
I know!

30:14.814 --> 30:16.358
That's really good.

30:16.399 --> 30:18.193
Yeah. I just hired them to be
the caterers for the wedding.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.195
I should probably get this
next time instead of the trout.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.447
[chuckles]

30:22.489 --> 30:23.782
Oh, no!

30:23.823 --> 30:25.533
No! What is this?

30:25.575 --> 30:27.243
-[gasps]
-What's wrong?

30:27.285 --> 30:29.120
I don't know.
There's some kind of leak here

30:29.162 --> 30:30.955
and I don't have
a plumber here today.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.749
Okay, uh, just give me
a second here.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.209
I can have a look.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.086
I'll just get
the shut-off valve.

30:36.127 --> 30:38.338
Okay, I can take care of this.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.256
Just give me a minute.

30:40.298 --> 30:41.132
Oh... okay.

30:41.174 --> 30:42.842
Thank--
Thank you so much.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.969
[torch whooshing]

30:46.721 --> 30:48.807
So do you moonlight
as a plumber?

30:48.848 --> 30:51.309
No, I use these tools
in my work.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.520
To paint?

30:53.561 --> 30:54.646
No, I'm a sculptor.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.272
I work with metal.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.942
Oh. I knew you were an artist,
I just didn't know what kind.

31:00.151 --> 31:01.820
Okay, so I've fixed it
temporarily.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.154
Uh, it's like a Band-aid.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.322
So if you want to use the sink,

31:04.364 --> 31:05.657
you're gonna need
to get a real plumber.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.992
Okay. Thank you so much. Um...

31:08.034 --> 31:09.786
I think you earned yourself
a second helping.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.996
[laughs] Okay.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.043
Yeah, okay.

31:17.085 --> 31:20.213
I booked the local deejay,
so all that leaves is the cake.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.924
Oh, did I tell you
about the near disaster

31:22.966 --> 31:24.009
we almost had
at the cottage?

31:24.050 --> 31:25.760
No. What happened there?

31:25.802 --> 31:27.429
Well,

31:27.470 --> 31:29.931
a pipe in the kitchen
sprung a leak.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.349
But luckily, Evan was there.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.767
He's a sculptor,

31:32.809 --> 31:34.436
so he had all the equipment
he needed to patch it up.

31:34.477 --> 31:35.395
How lucky was that?

31:35.437 --> 31:36.563
Wait a minute.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.440
What did you say
Evan's last name is again?

31:38.481 --> 31:40.650
Stanford. Why?

31:40.692 --> 31:42.402
Because he's famous!

31:42.444 --> 31:44.112
Oh, he is?

31:44.154 --> 31:46.364
Well, yes, in the art world.

31:46.406 --> 31:47.824
And how do you know that?

31:47.866 --> 31:49.826
You remember the guy

31:49.868 --> 31:51.161
I dated last year?

31:51.202 --> 31:52.704
The really pretentious one
who was into art?

31:52.746 --> 31:54.289
Yeah, the one whose name

31:54.330 --> 31:55.498
we're never supposed
to mention again?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.542
Yeah, no, and we're not.

31:57.584 --> 32:00.587
Anyway, he took me
to Evan's last gallery show

32:00.628 --> 32:01.755
and I really liked his work.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.757
It was very intense.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.884
Yeah, that was
my first impression of him.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.720
But he's...
mellowed a bit.

32:08.762 --> 32:10.096
You know,
I never actually met him,

32:10.138 --> 32:13.266
but from what I remember,
he is very attractive.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.225
Jill...

32:14.267 --> 32:15.852
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.062
You can forget all about that.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.147
We are just here for work.

32:19.189 --> 32:21.941
There is nothing wrong
with mixing work and romance.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.069
You met at a wedding cottage,
after all.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.570
How romantic is that?

32:25.612 --> 32:27.072
It's not.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.490
You've seen
the state of things here.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.242
Yeah, but look at how far
it's come in just two weeks.

32:31.284 --> 32:32.744
Well, it'll all be for nothing

32:32.786 --> 32:34.412
if we don't pull
this wedding off.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.039
Has there been
any progress on your end

32:36.081 --> 32:37.749
withGood Day, America?

32:37.791 --> 32:40.251
Maybe. Uh,
the first wedding I ever did

32:40.293 --> 32:42.796
was for a friend
who knows one of the producers,

32:42.837 --> 32:45.423
so I reached out to them,
and I'm waiting on a call back.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.175
Well, fingers crossed.

32:47.217 --> 32:48.551
And toes.

32:48.593 --> 32:49.928
Oh, I spoke with Amy.

32:49.969 --> 32:52.055
She has decided on wildflowers
for the wedding.

32:52.097 --> 32:53.765
That's what
I was gonna suggest!

32:53.807 --> 32:55.392
It goes perfectly
with their theme.

32:55.433 --> 32:56.893
I will get on it.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.186
Anything else?

32:58.228 --> 32:59.145
Yeah.

32:59.187 --> 33:01.106
Find out if Evan is single.

33:01.856 --> 33:02.899
Goodbye.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.693
[giggles] Bye!

33:05.985 --> 33:08.988
[***]

33:24.337 --> 33:25.422
Marilyn,

33:25.463 --> 33:26.631
do you know
the best place around here

33:26.673 --> 33:28.008
to find wildflowers?

33:28.049 --> 33:29.843
Uh... probably
the woods behind the cottage.

33:29.884 --> 33:31.011
Oh, that's convenient.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.303
Just watch out for moose.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.471
Moose?

33:33.513 --> 33:34.597
It's their mating season.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.475
Well, hopefully,
I'm not their type.

33:37.517 --> 33:39.394
[laughs]

33:39.436 --> 33:41.396
[***]

33:50.113 --> 33:52.032
[twigs snapping]

33:53.575 --> 33:55.368
[branches rustling]

33:59.789 --> 34:02.167
[rustling and snapping]

34:02.208 --> 34:03.877
Oh! Ah! Ow!
Hey-hey-hey-hey!

34:03.918 --> 34:05.253
Sorry!

34:05.295 --> 34:06.838
Watch where
you're swinging that thing!

34:06.880 --> 34:08.089
It's just me!

34:08.131 --> 34:09.174
I thought you were a moose!

34:09.215 --> 34:10.633
Do I look like a moose?

34:10.675 --> 34:12.761
No! But you never know.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.095
Look, I'm out here a lot

34:14.137 --> 34:16.723
and I've never come across one--
at least not yet.

34:16.765 --> 34:18.391
Well, at least it looks like

34:18.433 --> 34:19.851
you're starting
to finally slow down

34:19.893 --> 34:21.561
and enjoy the local scenery.

34:21.603 --> 34:24.147
Oh, it's not a exactly
a leisurely stroll.

34:24.189 --> 34:25.523
This is really more of
a work thing.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.776
I'm just collecting ideas

34:27.817 --> 34:28.568
to show the florist
for the wedding.

34:29.944 --> 34:32.072
Isn't that just doing
the florist's job for them?

34:33.239 --> 34:36.368
Well, I... I want the wedding
to be perfect.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.703
Especially since it's likely
the last one I'll be planning.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.038
Yeah, why is that?

34:40.080 --> 34:40.872
You seem
to really love doing them.

34:40.914 --> 34:43.333
I do.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.460
But now I have Tying the Knot,
and...

34:47.045 --> 34:49.964
...and after 234 weddings--

34:50.006 --> 34:53.259
including both my sisters,
all of my friends,

34:53.301 --> 34:55.387
and my parents' vow-renewal--

34:55.428 --> 34:57.806
it just seemed like time
to try something new.

34:57.847 --> 34:59.182
That's a lot of weddings.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.308
Yeah, but none of them
were mine,

35:00.350 --> 35:03.311
which is becoming
a bit depressing.

35:03.353 --> 35:05.355
I can't believe
I just said that.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.483
Ah, probably needed to be said.

35:08.525 --> 35:10.276
Yeah, but I've never
said it out loud,

35:10.318 --> 35:13.780
let alone to someone
who's practically a stranger.

35:13.822 --> 35:14.989
This is pretty embarrassing.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.658
Well, it's just me
and the trees out here...

35:16.700 --> 35:18.952
I mean, maybe a moose...

35:18.993 --> 35:21.579
so your secret is safe
with us.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.373
Can I ask you, though?

35:23.415 --> 35:25.291
How come none of the weddings
were yours?

35:26.376 --> 35:27.544
[sighs]

35:27.585 --> 35:29.254
I've always been

35:29.295 --> 35:31.965
a perfectionist
in my professional life,

35:32.007 --> 35:35.635
and that bled into
my personal life as well.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.431
I set the bar so high,
no one could really reach it,

35:39.472 --> 35:41.850
so none of my relationships
lasted.

35:41.891 --> 35:42.767
Well, at least
you figured it out.

35:42.809 --> 35:44.894
True.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.646
Although, launching
this new business

35:46.688 --> 35:49.607
hasn't really left time
for anything else.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.777
So I guess
that's just an excuse.

35:54.154 --> 35:56.406
Anyway, enough about me.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.616
Have you ever been
married before?

35:58.658 --> 36:00.118
Just once.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.494
Didn't last.

36:01.536 --> 36:02.871
I'm sorry.

36:02.912 --> 36:04.622
Was she also an artist?

36:04.664 --> 36:06.624
Heh! No, far from it.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.668
She didn't really like
the art world that much...

36:08.710 --> 36:10.086
or my art...

36:10.128 --> 36:12.380
just the status
that came along with it.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.507
Well, that must have
been hurtful.

36:15.592 --> 36:16.760
You know what?

36:16.801 --> 36:18.720
It wasn't entirely her fault.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.681
I used to get
completely consumed by my work.

36:22.807 --> 36:24.309
I can relate.

36:28.104 --> 36:31.983
Now I understand
slowing things down...

36:32.025 --> 36:34.110
taking the long walks.

36:34.152 --> 36:35.653
It's the Vermont way.

36:35.695 --> 36:36.738
[chuckles]

36:36.780 --> 36:38.239
Well, maybe
there's more to Vermont

36:38.281 --> 36:40.325
than just maple syrup.

36:47.290 --> 36:48.667
[Jill]
Are you sitting down?

36:48.708 --> 36:51.002
Well, I am driving
to New Hampshire to go see Amy,

36:51.044 --> 36:52.128
so, yes, I am.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.380
What's up?

36:53.421 --> 36:55.048
We got the booking
for Good Day, America.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.091
They just called!

36:56.132 --> 36:58.093
Oh, my gosh,
that's fantastic news.

36:58.134 --> 36:59.761
Well, whatever
you said to them,

36:59.803 --> 37:01.971
it got them to our website
and they loved it.

37:02.013 --> 37:03.932
Hopefully, this will
turn things around for us.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.308
It will.

37:07.477 --> 37:09.688
[***]

37:15.610 --> 37:17.153
You were right, Vanessa.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.115
This is the one.

37:20.156 --> 37:22.659
You look beautiful!

37:22.701 --> 37:23.702
I feel like a princess.

37:23.743 --> 37:25.286
Oh, my goodness.

37:25.328 --> 37:26.830
Did you know...

37:27.997 --> 37:30.458
...that the tradition
of wearing a white gown

37:30.500 --> 37:32.419
was started
by Queen Victoria?

37:32.460 --> 37:33.420
Really?

37:33.461 --> 37:34.462
Mm-hmm.

37:34.504 --> 37:35.797
She decided to forgo
the practice

37:35.839 --> 37:37.674
of wearing the coronation robes

37:37.716 --> 37:40.135
in favor of something
a little more modern.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.055
You just, like...

37:44.097 --> 37:46.391
know everything about weddings,
don't you?

37:46.433 --> 37:48.143
Sometimes, a little too much.

37:48.184 --> 37:49.227
I'm just...

37:49.269 --> 37:50.603
grateful...

37:50.645 --> 37:54.399
to, like, have you helping me
through all this.

37:54.441 --> 37:56.818
Especially since my parents
are gone

37:56.860 --> 37:59.195
and I don't really
have anyone else.

37:59.237 --> 38:00.572
You mentioned

38:00.613 --> 38:02.407
your grandfather will be
walking you down the aisle?

38:02.449 --> 38:04.743
Yes. And he and my grandma

38:04.784 --> 38:06.286
can't wait to see
the cottage again, by the way.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.746
Oh, yes.

38:07.787 --> 38:09.164
It is...
[chuckles awkwardly]

38:09.205 --> 38:10.790
It's quite the place.

38:10.832 --> 38:12.000
Yeah, Scott and I can't wait
to see it in person!

38:12.042 --> 38:13.543
Great!

38:13.585 --> 38:15.170
I want to, like, twirl...

38:15.211 --> 38:16.212
[laughing]

38:16.254 --> 38:19.507
[***]

38:19.549 --> 38:21.301
[phone rings]

38:21.343 --> 38:22.510
Hello?

38:22.552 --> 38:24.262
Vanessa, it's Daryl.

38:24.304 --> 38:25.347
I'm at the cottage.

38:25.388 --> 38:27.349
We've... got a situation.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.976
Oh, great.

38:30.018 --> 38:32.354
[sighs]
Well, you were right.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.814
There is a family of raccoons
living in the attic.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.274
So what are we gonna do?

38:36.316 --> 38:37.984
Nothing until we get
somebody from Fish and Wildlife

38:38.026 --> 38:39.736
out here to remove 'em.

38:39.778 --> 38:40.737
They figure they can
get somebody here

38:40.779 --> 38:41.613
in about two days.

38:41.654 --> 38:42.822
Two days?

38:42.864 --> 38:44.199
And in the meantime?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.867
Well, in the meantime...

38:45.909 --> 38:48.995
we can't start on the electrics,

38:49.037 --> 38:52.707
because all the wiring
is in the attic.

38:52.749 --> 38:55.543
Okay, let me
just get this straight.

38:55.585 --> 38:57.629
The wedding could be postponed

38:57.671 --> 39:00.757
on account of
a family of raccoons?

39:03.218 --> 39:04.302
[taps blueprint]

39:04.344 --> 39:06.221
In the attic.

39:07.347 --> 39:10.684
Roland, I know
the show is only two weeks away.

39:10.725 --> 39:12.894
Don't you have anything
that I can look at?

39:12.936 --> 39:14.688
Text me a photo,
a preliminary sketch.

39:14.729 --> 39:15.814
Just anything so that
I can get the word out.

39:15.855 --> 39:16.773
I'm just not ready

39:16.815 --> 39:18.108
to show it yet,

39:18.149 --> 39:20.235
but as soon as I am,
you'll be the first to know.

39:20.276 --> 39:22.779
All right.

39:24.155 --> 39:26.282
[sighs]

39:27.659 --> 39:29.786
[***]

39:37.961 --> 39:39.587
As long as we can't
start the wiring,

39:39.629 --> 39:40.880
I thought we could
start the painting.

39:40.922 --> 39:43.049
Oh! I almost forgot.

39:43.091 --> 39:46.052
These...
are a gift from my wife.

39:46.094 --> 39:48.930
A thank-you
for all of the lunches.

39:48.972 --> 39:51.599
They are
her maple-pecan blondies.

39:51.641 --> 39:52.600
Oh, my goodness,
they smell delicious.

39:52.642 --> 39:53.810
Oh, they are.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.062
People come from all over
just for those.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.148
Mm!

39:59.315 --> 40:00.442
Right?

40:00.483 --> 40:02.485
Does she do wedding cakes?

40:04.237 --> 40:05.405
I don't know.

40:05.447 --> 40:06.990
-You'll ask her.
-Mm-hmm.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.203
Evan?

40:14.039 --> 40:15.749
Evan?

40:15.790 --> 40:18.168
[***]

40:24.174 --> 40:25.050
[quietly] Wow.

40:40.690 --> 40:41.733
Looking for something?

40:41.775 --> 40:43.443
[gasps]

40:45.278 --> 40:47.364
That is the third time
you've startled me.

40:47.405 --> 40:49.324
It's not my fault you seem to be
in places that you shouldn't be.

40:49.366 --> 40:51.201
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your door was open.

40:51.242 --> 40:52.744
You know, if I didn't
know any better,

40:52.786 --> 40:54.371
I would swear
that my art dealer sent you here

40:54.412 --> 40:55.622
to spy on me.

40:55.663 --> 40:58.625
I can assure you,
I am not here to spy on you.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.168
I came to deliver

41:00.210 --> 41:03.171
these delicious
maple-pecan blondies,

41:03.213 --> 41:04.673
and you will thank me
after you taste them.

41:04.714 --> 41:06.716
Oh.

41:06.758 --> 41:07.884
Now will you please tell me
why you think your art dealer

41:07.926 --> 41:09.010
is spying on you?

41:09.052 --> 41:10.178
Uh, because he is worried

41:10.220 --> 41:11.638
that I will not
finish my piece on time.

41:12.847 --> 41:14.391
Is he right?

41:15.558 --> 41:17.560
Maybe.

41:18.728 --> 41:20.355
I have to say,

41:20.397 --> 41:22.148
I find it hard to believe
that someone with your talent

41:22.190 --> 41:24.901
could be
so creatively blocked.

41:28.363 --> 41:29.823
I...

41:29.864 --> 41:31.241
I Googled you.

41:32.492 --> 41:35.078
[laughs]
I think you're really talented!

41:35.120 --> 41:37.122
I've never seen anything
like your sculptures before.

41:37.163 --> 41:39.332
They're meant to represent
the urban landscape--

41:39.374 --> 41:42.335
the consequences of living
in a steel jungle.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.379
I could see that.

41:44.421 --> 41:47.549
I-I think you definitely
captured New York City.

41:47.590 --> 41:49.426
Yeah, but that was...

41:49.467 --> 41:51.219
that was then,
and I'm just-- I am...

41:51.261 --> 41:54.347
I'm so tired of being
the young, angry artist

41:54.389 --> 41:56.474
who's just railing against
the establishment.

41:56.516 --> 41:57.892
I'm... [deep breath]

41:57.934 --> 42:01.062
...trying to see things
from a new perspective.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.480
Well, what about
your paintings?

42:02.522 --> 42:05.066
I mean, this is nothing like
the urban landscape.

42:05.108 --> 42:07.068
These are like
the landscape here.

42:07.110 --> 42:08.778
That's because they are.

42:08.820 --> 42:10.196
But...

42:10.238 --> 42:12.615
I'm not the artist
who painted them.

42:12.657 --> 42:14.200
My grandmother was.

42:15.869 --> 42:17.579
They're really good.

42:17.620 --> 42:20.123
It was just her hobby.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.708
Her passion was the cottage,

42:21.750 --> 42:22.709
and she filled it
with all of her art.

42:31.551 --> 42:33.511
Did she sculpt, too?

42:33.553 --> 42:35.889
No, that is mine.

42:35.930 --> 42:37.515
I forgot all about that.

42:37.557 --> 42:40.143
I made that my first year
of art school.

42:40.185 --> 42:42.854
I-I got it from a piece of wood
that I found on one of my walks.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.773
Hmm.

42:44.814 --> 42:46.274
I really love it.

42:46.316 --> 42:47.984
Yeah?

42:49.736 --> 42:52.113
[***]

42:56.451 --> 42:57.369
I should go.

42:58.787 --> 43:01.623
I have...

43:01.664 --> 43:03.249
raccoons to feed.

43:05.293 --> 43:06.211
Okay.

43:07.879 --> 43:09.547
Well, thank you for feeding me.

43:09.589 --> 43:10.590
You're welcome.

43:12.092 --> 43:14.260
[***]

43:17.222 --> 43:19.724
[raccoons trilling]

43:21.643 --> 43:22.894
It's fine.

43:22.936 --> 43:24.145
They're releasing them
into the forest.

43:24.187 --> 43:25.814
They--
They'll be good.

43:25.855 --> 43:28.024
I'm gonna go in, seal it up,
make sure they don't come back.

43:28.066 --> 43:30.485
You weren't kidding
about the raccoons.

43:30.527 --> 43:32.654
No. Why would I kid?
That's not even funny.

43:32.696 --> 43:34.406
-[phone chimes]
-Sorry.

43:35.824 --> 43:37.659
No, no. No-no-no.

43:37.701 --> 43:39.202
What's wrong?

43:39.244 --> 43:41.329
The bride and groom are
on their way to Stony Bridge.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.914
They want to come
see the cottage.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.666
Well, that's okay.

43:44.708 --> 43:45.959
It's starting to come together.

43:46.001 --> 43:47.585
I can't let them
see it like this.

43:47.627 --> 43:49.295
Why?

43:49.337 --> 43:53.133
Because I wasn't
exactly truthful with them.

43:53.174 --> 43:54.926
I didn't have the heart
to tell them

43:54.968 --> 43:56.219
that not only
was their dream cottage

43:56.261 --> 43:57.721
closed for business,

43:57.762 --> 44:01.975
it was also looking more like
a nightmare than a dream.

44:02.017 --> 44:03.351
-No offense.
-Oh, none taken.

44:03.393 --> 44:04.728
Actually, I think
it's pretty nice

44:04.769 --> 44:06.312
that you're trying
to protect them.

44:06.354 --> 44:08.148
Thank you.

44:08.189 --> 44:10.692
I just need to find a way
to keep them away from here,

44:10.734 --> 44:11.693
and fast.

44:14.779 --> 44:16.197
Maybe I can help.

44:16.239 --> 44:18.742
I'm a bit of an expert
in the art of stalling.

44:24.497 --> 44:27.500
It's kind of a wild idea,
but it might work,

44:27.542 --> 44:29.502
and I think I can get
some other folks to pitch in.

44:29.544 --> 44:32.172
Oh! That would be
such a lifesaver.

44:32.213 --> 44:33.548
-I'll see what I can do.
-Okay.

44:33.590 --> 44:36.343
How did you ever come up
with this idea, anyway?

44:36.384 --> 44:38.678
Uh, actually, it was all Evan.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.181
Evan,
like Rose's grandson, Evan?

44:41.222 --> 44:42.682
Mm-hmm.

44:42.724 --> 44:45.935
Hmm. I didn't know
you two had gotten so close.

44:45.977 --> 44:47.562
He's just being helpful.

44:48.730 --> 44:50.440
Hmm.

44:50.482 --> 44:53.943
Did I happen to mention that,
before I opened the B&B,

44:53.985 --> 44:55.987
I had a dance studio?

44:56.029 --> 44:57.405
I don't think so...

44:57.447 --> 45:00.200
but I think I know
where you're going with this.

45:00.241 --> 45:01.409
[chuckling]

45:01.451 --> 45:02.786
[both giggling]

45:02.827 --> 45:04.871
I'm sorry
if we just sprung this on you

45:04.913 --> 45:05.955
at the last minute.

45:05.997 --> 45:07.123
Oh, no, it's no problem at all.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.500
Yeah, we thought since, um,

45:08.541 --> 45:10.293
Scott managed to get
the day off from the base,

45:10.335 --> 45:11.795
and I didn't have
any classes today,

45:11.836 --> 45:14.422
so... it was the perfect day
to come see the cottage.

45:14.464 --> 45:15.799
-Yes.
-Yeah.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.384
And, actually, I'm really glad
you're both here,

45:17.425 --> 45:19.469
because there are still
a lot of decisions to be made.

45:19.511 --> 45:21.137
And who better to make them
than you two...

45:21.179 --> 45:22.472
in person!

45:22.514 --> 45:24.557
And then, once those
are all out of the way,

45:24.599 --> 45:26.351
then we can go
see the cottage.

45:26.393 --> 45:27.686
Sound good?

45:27.727 --> 45:28.520
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:28.561 --> 45:29.771
Great.

45:29.813 --> 45:30.980
Hi, Nadine!

45:31.022 --> 45:32.273
Hi.

45:32.315 --> 45:33.817
This is Amy and Scott,

45:33.858 --> 45:35.235
the winners

45:35.276 --> 45:36.403
of the Tying The Knot
wedding contest.

45:36.444 --> 45:38.071
It's nice to meet you both.

45:38.113 --> 45:39.614
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

45:39.656 --> 45:40.782
I know you're pressed for time,

45:40.824 --> 45:43.076
so I arranged just
a small tasting session.

45:43.118 --> 45:44.327
Come on.

45:44.369 --> 45:45.745
-Okay.
-After you.

45:45.787 --> 45:48.498
[***]

45:49.666 --> 45:51.042
Wow!

45:51.084 --> 45:52.293
Have a seat.

45:52.335 --> 45:53.712
[Scott]
That is a lot of cake.

45:53.753 --> 45:55.380
And you have to try every one.

45:55.422 --> 45:56.673
-Okay.
-Okay.

45:56.715 --> 45:57.549
Fun.

45:57.590 --> 45:59.342
This is cookies and cream.

45:59.384 --> 46:00.719
This one
is traditional chocolate.

46:00.760 --> 46:01.720
Mm!

46:01.761 --> 46:02.887
Do you want to try
the espresso?

46:02.929 --> 46:04.014
You look like an espresso.

46:04.055 --> 46:05.515
Let's try this.
This one is carrot cake.

46:05.557 --> 46:07.267
-Autumn spice.
-Autumn spice.

46:07.308 --> 46:09.102
-Chocolate caramel.
-Chocolate caramel.

46:11.229 --> 46:13.189
Next up,
we have the florist.

46:13.231 --> 46:15.775
[***]

46:32.459 --> 46:37.505
Okay, so, next, I was thinking
we could get some lunch.

46:37.547 --> 46:39.549
There's a great little
restaurant

46:39.591 --> 46:41.217
right around the corner
from here.

46:41.259 --> 46:43.053
I'm still full
from all the cake.

46:44.262 --> 46:46.598
So, not even...

46:46.639 --> 46:49.059
a light salad or...

46:49.100 --> 46:50.060
a soup?

46:50.101 --> 46:51.478
No. But thank you.

46:51.519 --> 46:54.147
The day's going a little faster
than we thought.

46:54.189 --> 46:56.399
Uh... maybe we just go
see the Wedding Cottage now?

46:56.441 --> 46:58.401
[Amy]
We have a 5:00 train back,

46:58.443 --> 46:59.736
so we don't want
to cut it too close.

46:59.778 --> 47:02.072
Right. Well, there's
really just one quick stop

47:02.113 --> 47:03.239
we have left to make.

47:03.281 --> 47:05.825
It's...
It's a part of the contest,

47:05.867 --> 47:06.910
and I was saving it
as a surprise.

47:06.951 --> 47:09.245
Well...

47:09.287 --> 47:10.789
-Okay, let's go!

47:13.667 --> 47:15.585
So...

47:15.627 --> 47:17.921
this is where
your guests will be staying.

47:23.134 --> 47:24.094
[***]

47:24.135 --> 47:25.387
Oh, wow.

47:25.428 --> 47:26.971
[***]

47:27.013 --> 47:29.432
Huh.

47:29.474 --> 47:30.850
It's our song.

47:30.892 --> 47:33.103
Amy, Scott...

47:33.144 --> 47:34.813
I'd like you to meet Marilyn...

47:34.854 --> 47:35.855
Hi.

47:35.897 --> 47:38.525
...the owner
of this fabulous B&B,

47:38.566 --> 47:40.527
and also a professional
dance instructor.

47:40.568 --> 47:42.946
Tying The Knotwould like
to offer you both

47:42.987 --> 47:45.323
a complimentary
wedding dance lesson.

47:45.365 --> 47:47.367
I don't think
that's a good idea,

47:47.409 --> 47:48.702
not with my bum leg.

47:49.744 --> 47:51.788
Oh, Scott,
I am so sorry,

47:51.830 --> 47:53.623
I should have run this
by you first.

47:53.665 --> 47:54.958
No, Vanessa, it's okay.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.751
I mean, even though
Scott has a prosthetic leg,

47:56.793 --> 47:58.795
we still go
hiking and rock climbing.

47:58.837 --> 48:00.380
Like, we do
all sorts of activities, so.

48:00.422 --> 48:02.007
Dancing just isn't one of them.

48:03.174 --> 48:04.592
Well, we-we did

48:04.634 --> 48:06.636
talk about maybe having
a first dance at the wedding.

48:06.678 --> 48:09.347
And you said you would try.

48:09.389 --> 48:11.391
And we do have
an instructor here.

48:11.433 --> 48:13.018
[sighs]

48:15.020 --> 48:16.146
All right.

48:16.187 --> 48:18.023
But I'm not promising anything.

48:18.064 --> 48:19.607
[laughs]

48:19.649 --> 48:21.818
You're going
to circle each other.

48:21.860 --> 48:22.902
Eye contact.

48:22.944 --> 48:24.320
That's it.

48:24.362 --> 48:26.114
A little playful,
a little sexy...

48:26.156 --> 48:28.074
Now a little twirl in.

48:28.116 --> 48:29.701
That's it. And sway.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.327
-Okay, like this?
-Yeah.

48:31.369 --> 48:34.122
And then pull her in.
There you go.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.832
Support her arm here.

48:35.874 --> 48:38.501
Move her with the pressure
of your hand, yeah.

48:38.543 --> 48:40.045
How's it going?

48:40.086 --> 48:42.297
Good. Everything is going
according to plan.

48:42.339 --> 48:43.923
-What about you?
-Ready to go.

48:43.965 --> 48:45.091
[***]

48:45.133 --> 48:46.259
[footsteps shuffle]

48:46.301 --> 48:48.261
Oh... [groans]

48:48.303 --> 48:49.721
Sorry I'm so bad at this.

48:49.763 --> 48:51.973
Don't be sorry.
We'll get there.

48:52.015 --> 48:53.350
Sorry to interrupt.

48:53.391 --> 48:55.643
I just wanted
to introduce Evan.

48:55.685 --> 48:57.812
He is the owner
of the Wedding Cottage.

48:57.854 --> 48:59.481
-Hi.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

48:59.522 --> 49:00.607
Hi. Nice to meet you.

49:00.648 --> 49:02.692
You two want
to try it again?

49:02.734 --> 49:05.737
Um... I'm not sure
it'll do us any good.

49:05.779 --> 49:08.156
Well, I have an idea.

49:08.198 --> 49:09.407
Um...

49:09.449 --> 49:11.034
I don't know
if Evan remembers this,

49:11.076 --> 49:14.329
but I used to teach dance
to all the kids in town,

49:14.371 --> 49:19.542
so, maybe if he and Vanessa
wouldn't mind demonstrating?

49:19.584 --> 49:21.836
I think it might help
Scott and Amy.

49:23.171 --> 49:24.839
I do remember those lessons,

49:24.881 --> 49:27.467
and although
I am a little rusty...

49:27.509 --> 49:29.969
I'm game
if Vanessa is.

49:31.721 --> 49:34.808
I am also a little rusty...

49:34.849 --> 49:36.976
but happy to give it a shot.

49:40.021 --> 49:41.231
[***]

49:41.272 --> 49:45.527
* There goes my hands shaking *

49:45.568 --> 49:48.196
* And you are the reason *

49:50.365 --> 49:52.117
* My heart keeps bleeding *

49:54.452 --> 49:56.746
* I need you now *

49:58.665 --> 50:00.583
* If I could turn... *

50:00.625 --> 50:03.128
So, you two ready
to give it another try?

50:03.169 --> 50:04.504
Let's do this.

50:04.546 --> 50:06.715
* ...I'd make sure
the light defeated the dark *

50:06.756 --> 50:08.133
* I'd spend every hour... *

50:08.174 --> 50:09.926
Bring her in nice and close.
That's it.

50:09.968 --> 50:13.346
* ...Of every day
Keeping you safe *

50:15.015 --> 50:17.517
* And I'd climb
every mountain *

50:17.559 --> 50:19.394
[wobbles]

50:19.436 --> 50:20.186
[Scott inhales sharply]

50:20.228 --> 50:22.105
You all right?

50:22.147 --> 50:23.565
Um...

50:23.606 --> 50:24.691
just give me a minute.

50:27.152 --> 50:29.404
[door creaks open]

50:29.446 --> 50:31.823
[door thuds]

50:31.865 --> 50:33.491
You know,
give me a second.

50:33.533 --> 50:35.243
I'm... I'm gonna talk to him.

50:35.285 --> 50:36.327
Okay.

50:43.126 --> 50:44.169
-Hey.
-Hey.

50:46.713 --> 50:48.465
Look, I'm not gonna
pretend to know

50:48.506 --> 50:49.716
what you're going through,

50:49.758 --> 50:51.301
because I don't.

50:52.510 --> 50:56.431
But one thing that I do know
about is overcoming your fears.

50:59.642 --> 51:01.311
[deep breath, sighs]

51:01.353 --> 51:03.480
The funny thing is...

51:03.521 --> 51:05.190
I was never scared in combat.

51:07.025 --> 51:10.362
But, right now, I am afraid
of letting Amy down.

51:13.323 --> 51:15.825
Well, I am pretty sure
that Amy would just be happy

51:15.867 --> 51:17.035
to have your arms
wrapped around her.

51:19.704 --> 51:21.039
You're already her hero.

51:24.209 --> 51:25.960
[chuckles]

51:28.922 --> 51:30.298
Come on.

51:30.340 --> 51:31.800
You're right.

51:31.841 --> 51:34.844
* Swim every ocean *

51:36.388 --> 51:39.683
* Just to be with you *

51:39.724 --> 51:43.103
* And fix what I've broken *

51:45.772 --> 51:49.067
* 'Cause I need you *

51:49.109 --> 51:50.860
* To see *

51:52.570 --> 51:54.948
* That you are the reason *

51:54.989 --> 51:55.907
Good job!

51:55.949 --> 51:57.450
Yeah!

51:57.492 --> 51:59.452
[laughing and clapping]

51:59.494 --> 52:00.662
[Amy giggles]

52:00.704 --> 52:02.038
I am so sorry.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.708
I hate to leave,
but I have to go.

52:04.749 --> 52:06.042
Um, I just remembered

52:06.084 --> 52:08.336
I have this conference call
with my office,

52:08.378 --> 52:11.881
but Evan is going to drive you
to the cottage.

52:11.923 --> 52:13.967
Okay! Well, thank you
for today, Vanessa.

52:14.009 --> 52:15.552
It was-- It was...
It was wonderful.

52:15.593 --> 52:17.345
I'll see you two soon.

52:17.387 --> 52:18.388
Yeah.

52:19.764 --> 52:21.182
Okay. So, uh,

52:21.224 --> 52:22.767
would the two of you
like to see anything else

52:22.809 --> 52:24.019
before we head out there?

52:24.060 --> 52:25.979
I could show you
our famous covered bridges.

52:26.021 --> 52:27.814
No. No, we're--
we're just really excited

52:27.856 --> 52:29.149
to see the cottage.

52:30.358 --> 52:32.277
At your service!

52:32.318 --> 52:34.821
[***]

52:42.287 --> 52:44.330
Oh, no.

52:44.372 --> 52:45.957
I didn't know this was out.

52:45.999 --> 52:48.043
Okay, we're gonna have
to take the long way around,

52:48.084 --> 52:49.669
might add
another half hour or so.

52:49.711 --> 52:52.172
I-I didn't realize
it was that far from town.

52:52.213 --> 52:53.923
Do you think
we'll get back to town

52:53.965 --> 52:55.133
in time
to catch our train?

52:55.175 --> 52:56.634
Depends. What time
does your train leave?

52:56.676 --> 52:57.886
Five o'clock.

52:57.927 --> 53:00.305
Ooh, that might be
cutting it close.

53:00.347 --> 53:02.891
I have to be
back at the base at 20:00 hours,

53:02.932 --> 53:05.435
so we have to catch
the 5:00.

53:08.980 --> 53:11.608
Scott, maybe we should
skip seeing the cottage.

53:11.649 --> 53:13.610
Just head back.

53:13.651 --> 53:15.653
Unfortunately,
I think that she's right.

53:15.695 --> 53:18.823
[***]

53:22.994 --> 53:25.205
To Operation Distraction.

53:25.246 --> 53:26.831
[clinking]

53:29.876 --> 53:31.336
I really don't know
how to thank you.

53:31.378 --> 53:33.421
You're the mad genius
behind it all.

53:33.463 --> 53:34.422
I was just happy to help.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.299
Mad genius, huh?

53:36.341 --> 53:37.509
Yeah.

53:37.550 --> 53:40.553
But in a...
a cute way.

53:42.639 --> 53:44.391
What I mean is,

53:44.432 --> 53:46.351
you did all of this
just so that Scott and Amy

53:46.393 --> 53:48.895
wouldn't have
their wedding dreams dashed.

53:48.937 --> 53:50.230
Not many people would do that.

53:51.648 --> 53:53.692
I think you're giving me
too much credit.

53:53.733 --> 53:55.527
[laughs] I don't know.

53:55.568 --> 53:56.653
Just a couple of weeks ago,

53:56.695 --> 53:57.821
you were begging me

53:57.862 --> 53:59.239
to let you fix up
the Wedding Cottage,

53:59.280 --> 54:00.949
and now it's almost ready
for business.

54:00.990 --> 54:03.743
I guess a lot can happen
in a couple weeks.

54:03.785 --> 54:04.786
Mm-hmm.

54:04.828 --> 54:07.205
When we first met...

54:07.247 --> 54:10.625
I thought you were
a grouchy recluse.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.168
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

54:12.210 --> 54:14.004
Well, I'm still
a bit of a recluse,

54:14.045 --> 54:16.673
but maybe
a little less of a grump...

54:16.715 --> 54:18.133
thanks to you.

54:18.174 --> 54:20.176
And you're giving me
too much credit again.

54:20.218 --> 54:22.303
Would you rather I just
go back to being a grouch?

54:22.345 --> 54:23.513
No!

54:23.555 --> 54:24.514
[both laughing]

54:28.476 --> 54:30.270
I like the new Evan better.

54:31.771 --> 54:33.106
So do I.

54:37.986 --> 54:40.864
Looks like
you've had an effect

54:40.905 --> 54:42.574
on both me
and the Wedding Cottage.

54:49.998 --> 54:52.292
[***]

54:54.502 --> 54:56.880
And when did you join the crew?

54:56.921 --> 54:59.090
I'm just pitching in.

54:59.132 --> 55:01.176
We're running a little behind

55:01.217 --> 55:03.261
on account of
the family of raccoons.

55:03.303 --> 55:06.473
Ah, yes...
speaking of raccoons,

55:06.514 --> 55:07.891
there's something
I need to show you.

55:07.932 --> 55:09.309
Uh-oh.

55:09.351 --> 55:11.269
Around back, if you will.

55:12.270 --> 55:13.313
So we're just finishing up

55:13.355 --> 55:15.440
on the attic
and the roof back there,

55:15.482 --> 55:18.735
but that big, old tree
is growing right in,

55:18.777 --> 55:20.403
and it's just gonna
lift up all the work

55:20.445 --> 55:21.613
that we just finished,

55:21.654 --> 55:22.655
if we don't trim it.

55:22.697 --> 55:23.823
That's fine by me.

55:23.865 --> 55:25.533
It's not your permission
I need.

55:25.575 --> 55:26.534
Oh.

55:28.286 --> 55:31.206
There's no way that I'm letting
anyone cut this tree.

55:31.247 --> 55:32.999
I don't want to cut it down,
I just want to trim it.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.292
The tree is almost
100 years old.

55:34.334 --> 55:35.877
All the more reason
to trim it.

55:35.919 --> 55:37.170
Now, look,
I gave you permission

55:37.212 --> 55:39.839
to work on the cottage,
not the trees.

55:39.881 --> 55:42.926
Okay. Well, why don't we just
put a pin in the tree for now,

55:42.967 --> 55:44.219
because there are other things
I'm concerned about.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.553
Like, for example,

55:45.595 --> 55:47.597
those columns I found
on the side of the house--

55:47.639 --> 55:49.015
I'd like to move them
to the front,

55:49.057 --> 55:50.392
but one of them is broken.

55:50.433 --> 55:51.476
So do you think
you could replace it?

55:51.518 --> 55:54.020
Uh, those columns
are custom pieces.

55:54.062 --> 55:55.939
You don't have time for that.

55:55.980 --> 55:58.525
Oh. That's disappointing,

55:58.566 --> 56:00.193
because they were gonna be
the first thing everyone saw

56:00.235 --> 56:01.236
when they came in the door.

56:02.445 --> 56:03.905
I'll have a look
at the columns,

56:03.947 --> 56:05.490
but, to be frank...

56:05.532 --> 56:07.534
this tree's
a much bigger problem.

56:07.575 --> 56:09.703
[***]

56:15.166 --> 56:17.377
What's the story
with the tree?

56:17.419 --> 56:19.462
There's no story. Okay?

56:19.504 --> 56:20.714
It's...

56:20.755 --> 56:22.340
it's history.

56:22.382 --> 56:24.467
My grandparents
planted this tree

56:24.509 --> 56:26.845
when they opened up
the cottage.

56:26.886 --> 56:29.723
I'm not usually sentimental
about these sort of things,

56:29.764 --> 56:30.932
but...

56:30.974 --> 56:32.225
I really like this tree.

56:32.267 --> 56:35.395
I like everything about it.

56:35.437 --> 56:37.313
I like the way that the light
reflects off of it

56:37.355 --> 56:39.983
at the end of the day.

56:41.234 --> 56:43.570
Okay.

56:43.611 --> 56:46.781
So you see this tree
as a piece of art?

56:46.823 --> 56:49.325
Yeah. I do.

56:50.535 --> 56:52.245
Well...

56:52.287 --> 56:57.292
this piece of art
is growing into your cottage.

56:59.753 --> 57:01.463
Okay. Fine.

57:01.504 --> 57:03.631
I will give you permission
to let them trim it,

57:03.673 --> 57:05.342
but they have to treat this
like a piece of art.

57:05.383 --> 57:06.634
Just a little.
I promise.

57:08.011 --> 57:09.304
-Thank you.
-All right.

57:12.390 --> 57:13.933
You'll see they left
as much as they could

57:13.975 --> 57:15.727
while getting it
off the house.

57:15.769 --> 57:16.895
See?

57:16.936 --> 57:18.063
We only trimmed a little.

57:18.104 --> 57:21.274
Mm-hmm.

57:21.316 --> 57:22.942
Think you can
leave that one for me?

57:22.984 --> 57:24.319
I think
I'd like to keep it.

57:24.361 --> 57:25.820
Sure, no problem.

57:28.573 --> 57:29.949
Good job.

57:31.159 --> 57:33.787
[***]

57:44.172 --> 57:45.965
What's all this?

57:46.007 --> 57:48.301
I fixed the column.

57:48.343 --> 57:49.469
I can see that!

57:49.511 --> 57:50.845
How did you do this?

57:50.887 --> 57:52.722
I made it.

57:52.764 --> 57:55.767
Okay, but this is--
this is a perfect match.

57:55.809 --> 57:57.310
It's not perfect.

57:57.352 --> 58:00.021
I'm not a finish carpenter,
but I think it's close enough.

58:00.063 --> 58:01.731
Evan, thank you.

58:01.773 --> 58:04.984
Is this why you wanted to save
that piece of branch out back?

58:05.026 --> 58:08.571
I didn't use that,
but I used it as inspiration.

58:08.613 --> 58:10.240
Well, I really appreciate it.

58:10.281 --> 58:12.492
Um, Amy and Scott

58:12.534 --> 58:13.827
are gonna be
on Good Day, America

58:13.868 --> 58:15.245
in a few minutes,

58:15.286 --> 58:17.330
and I was wondering
if you wanted to watch with me.

58:17.372 --> 58:19.499
Yes, absolutely.

58:19.541 --> 58:21.751
I mean, I do have
a vested interested in them.

58:21.793 --> 58:22.961
[laughs]

58:23.003 --> 58:24.504
Okay.

58:26.256 --> 58:27.716
This morning, we are talking

58:27.757 --> 58:29.217
with Amy Price

58:29.259 --> 58:30.468
and Staff Sergeant
Scott Bishop,

58:30.510 --> 58:32.762
who are the winners
of a contest

58:32.804 --> 58:34.889
sponsored by a new guide book
and website

58:34.931 --> 58:38.476
calledTying The Knot:
A Guide To The Perfect Wedding.

58:38.518 --> 58:41.479
The prize is the wedding
of their dreams.

58:41.521 --> 58:45.025
So, tell us, what is
that dream wedding going to be?

58:45.066 --> 58:47.485
Well, um, we chose
a beautiful wedding cottage

58:47.527 --> 58:49.571
in Stony Bridge, Vermont.

58:49.612 --> 58:51.698
Okay. So you're about to have
your dream wedding,

58:51.740 --> 58:53.658
but I think people
would also like to know

58:53.700 --> 58:55.452
how you two first met.

58:55.493 --> 58:56.411
[Scott takes a deep breath]

58:56.453 --> 58:58.079
You do it. Okay, okay.

58:58.121 --> 59:00.457
Um... it was a blind date.

59:00.498 --> 59:02.667
Only I mistakenly went up
to the wrong girl.

59:02.709 --> 59:04.085
Me!

59:04.127 --> 59:05.545
But she turned out to be
the right girl in the end,

59:05.587 --> 59:09.007
and I fell in love with her
on that first date.

59:09.049 --> 59:11.384
Well, it has certainly
been a pleasure meeting you both

59:11.426 --> 59:12.886
and hearing your love story.

59:12.927 --> 59:14.304
Thank you!
Um, w-would it be okay

59:14.346 --> 59:15.388
if we just gave
a quick shout-out

59:15.430 --> 59:17.057
to the people
in Stony Bridge?

59:17.098 --> 59:18.058
Sure, go for it.

59:18.099 --> 59:19.559
Okay.

59:19.601 --> 59:20.894
We'd like to thank the ladies
at the floral shop,

59:20.935 --> 59:22.020
uh, Marilyn

59:22.062 --> 59:23.146
at the bed & breakfast,

59:23.188 --> 59:24.981
Evan, who owns
the Wedding Cottage,

59:25.023 --> 59:27.650
and of course, Vanessa and Jill
from Tying The Knot.

59:27.692 --> 59:30.320
And we can't forget
Nadine's Vermont Bakery--

59:30.362 --> 59:31.404
they're making our cake.

59:31.446 --> 59:34.407
[laughing] Yes!

59:34.449 --> 59:36.368
You know, they are sweet kids.

59:36.409 --> 59:38.578
Yeah, I know.

59:38.620 --> 59:40.997
I don't think I could've
picked a better couple.

59:41.039 --> 59:43.500
And this should be
a big boost for your business.

59:43.541 --> 59:45.043
Yeah, I hope so.

59:45.085 --> 59:47.045
Well, how could it not be,
with you at the helm?

59:48.296 --> 59:49.506
You are an extraordinary person,

59:49.547 --> 59:52.342
even if you are a little...

59:52.384 --> 59:54.135
A little bit of a pest?

59:54.177 --> 59:55.303
I was gonna say "tenacious".

59:55.345 --> 59:58.098
Oh. Well, it got me this far,
didn't it?

59:58.139 --> 59:59.099
So what's next?

1:00:01.476 --> 1:00:04.354
So, I am going to go
back to New York.

1:00:04.396 --> 1:00:05.605
Mm-hmm.

1:00:05.647 --> 1:00:07.440
And, you know, we always said

1:00:07.482 --> 1:00:08.942
that if Tying The Knot
was a success,

1:00:08.983 --> 1:00:11.611
we'd get started on the European
version of the book, so...

1:00:11.653 --> 1:00:14.155
so I guess I'll do that.

1:00:14.197 --> 1:00:16.199
What about you?

1:00:16.241 --> 1:00:19.536
I think I'm gonna stick around
for a little while.

1:00:20.829 --> 1:00:23.206
I finally had a breakthrough.

1:00:23.248 --> 1:00:24.207
That's so great!

1:00:24.249 --> 1:00:25.458
Yeah.

1:00:25.500 --> 1:00:27.544
Okay. All right.

1:00:27.585 --> 1:00:30.338
So... no more tic-tac-toe?

1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:32.007
[groans]

1:00:32.048 --> 1:00:33.091
You saw that?

1:00:33.133 --> 1:00:34.759
I did.

1:00:34.801 --> 1:00:36.803
Well, you know,
I never win anyways.

1:00:36.845 --> 1:00:39.264
Yeah.

1:00:39.305 --> 1:00:40.640
I think you might be
doing it wrong.

1:00:40.682 --> 1:00:41.891
You're not supposed
to play alone.

1:00:41.933 --> 1:00:45.020
Maybe I just haven't
found the right partner.

1:00:48.606 --> 1:00:50.692
Have you given up
looking for a partner?

1:00:52.902 --> 1:00:56.990
I wasn't really
looking for one at all.

1:00:57.032 --> 1:00:58.491
And then, one day,

1:00:58.533 --> 1:01:01.036
someone knocked on my door
looking for the Wedding Cottage.

1:01:02.537 --> 1:01:04.414
And ruined
all your peace and quiet.

1:01:04.456 --> 1:01:06.541
Yeah. Just in time.

1:01:08.043 --> 1:01:10.795
[***]

1:01:18.053 --> 1:01:19.054
[workers' voices]

1:01:22.015 --> 1:01:23.266
[Evan chuckles]

1:01:25.185 --> 1:01:29.272
I should probably,
uh, get back to work.

1:01:29.314 --> 1:01:30.940
You know, now that
I'm all inspired.

1:01:30.982 --> 1:01:32.108
[laughs]

1:01:32.150 --> 1:01:35.195
Okay. Well, um...

1:01:35.236 --> 1:01:36.738
thank you

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:39.282
for...

1:01:39.324 --> 1:01:40.867
all-all of your help
on the column.

1:01:40.909 --> 1:01:43.661
I know Daryl
will be very impressed.

1:01:45.497 --> 1:01:47.832
You know that I wasn't
trying to impress Daryl.

1:01:51.461 --> 1:01:53.046
[smooch]

1:01:58.426 --> 1:01:59.969
[footsteps receding]

1:02:05.975 --> 1:02:07.644
[***]

1:02:07.686 --> 1:02:09.729
[phone rings]

1:02:09.771 --> 1:02:10.939
Hello?

1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:12.315
[Jill] Good news!

1:02:12.357 --> 1:02:14.109
I just got off the phone
with Top Trends Magazine,

1:02:14.150 --> 1:02:15.443
and they want to
come out there today

1:02:15.485 --> 1:02:17.153
and do a piece on you
and the wedding.

1:02:17.195 --> 1:02:18.279
That's incredible!

1:02:18.321 --> 1:02:19.989
-I know!
-And I have

1:02:20.031 --> 1:02:21.449
some good news for you--

1:02:21.491 --> 1:02:25.078
Um, Evan agreed
to live streaming the wedding.

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.788
Well, that is
quite a turnaround.

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:28.415
Not really.

1:02:28.456 --> 1:02:31.167
Turns out he's quite
the romantic at heart.

1:02:32.585 --> 1:02:35.296
[***]

1:02:36.548 --> 1:02:37.507
Hi.

1:02:38.675 --> 1:02:41.594
Just dropping these off
and then I'll go.

1:02:41.636 --> 1:02:42.679
Oh, no,
you don't have to rush off.

1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:46.141
I don't want to bother you
while you're working.

1:02:46.182 --> 1:02:47.726
I don't mind
being bothered by you.

1:02:47.767 --> 1:02:49.519
Plus, I should at least
say good morning.

1:02:55.025 --> 1:02:56.234
Mm.

1:02:56.276 --> 1:02:58.153
And thank you so much
for the coffee.

1:02:58.194 --> 1:02:59.446
I really appreciate it.

1:02:59.487 --> 1:03:00.822
I've been up half the night
working.

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:02.407
Well, that sounds good.

1:03:02.449 --> 1:03:03.867
So good
that I called my art dealer

1:03:03.908 --> 1:03:06.077
and I told him that I was gonna
be ready for the show.

1:03:06.119 --> 1:03:07.412
That's fantastic!

1:03:07.454 --> 1:03:09.831
Can I get a little...
sneak peek?

1:03:12.375 --> 1:03:14.586
It's not quite ready yet.

1:03:14.627 --> 1:03:15.628
I understand.

1:03:15.670 --> 1:03:17.172
-I get it.
-Okay.

1:03:17.213 --> 1:03:18.381
See you later.

1:03:18.423 --> 1:03:20.508
Yeah.

1:03:20.550 --> 1:03:22.719
Would you like
to have dinner tonight?

1:03:24.095 --> 1:03:25.221
I'd love that.

1:03:26.306 --> 1:03:28.433
[***]

1:03:35.648 --> 1:03:37.484
And that got me interested
in learning about

1:03:37.525 --> 1:03:39.361
other cultures'
wedding traditions,

1:03:39.402 --> 1:03:41.529
and then, one thing
led to another, and it...

1:03:41.571 --> 1:03:43.907
it just sort of morphed
into a business.

1:03:43.948 --> 1:03:46.701
So then, what inspired you
to transition to the guide book?

1:03:46.743 --> 1:03:50.163
Well, after years
of compiling information

1:03:50.205 --> 1:03:51.373
and resources

1:03:51.414 --> 1:03:53.708
about all things
wedding-related,

1:03:53.750 --> 1:03:55.001
I just sort of thought,

1:03:55.043 --> 1:03:56.378
"Why not put it
all in one source?"

1:03:56.419 --> 1:03:59.005
Both in print and online.
You can...

1:03:59.047 --> 1:04:00.715
I got it.

1:04:00.757 --> 1:04:02.384
One last question.

1:04:02.425 --> 1:04:04.969
What's your idea
of the perfect wedding?

1:04:07.472 --> 1:04:09.391
Uh...

1:04:09.432 --> 1:04:12.852
well, this may sound
a little biased,

1:04:12.894 --> 1:04:16.106
but, for me,
the ideal wedding would be...

1:04:16.147 --> 1:04:18.608
at a place exactly like this.

1:04:18.650 --> 1:04:20.652
Where everyone finds
their "happily ever after"?

1:04:22.237 --> 1:04:23.363
[chuckles]
I saw the sign.

1:04:23.405 --> 1:04:25.824
[laughs] Okay! Yes. Yes.

1:04:25.865 --> 1:04:27.742
Happily ever after.

1:04:30.537 --> 1:04:32.580
[Evan] How you doing, Daryl?

1:04:32.622 --> 1:04:35.166
Hey.

1:04:35.208 --> 1:04:37.627
Hey, was that by chance
Evan Stanford?

1:04:37.669 --> 1:04:38.837
Uh-huh.

1:04:38.878 --> 1:04:40.463
What's he doing around here?

1:04:40.505 --> 1:04:41.923
Oh, he owns the place.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:43.341
He owns
the Wedding Cottage?

1:04:43.383 --> 1:04:45.885
Yeah. Lives here, too.

1:04:49.305 --> 1:04:50.640
[laughing] Can't wait!

1:04:50.682 --> 1:04:51.975
-With a boutonniere.
-Oh, no!

1:04:52.017 --> 1:04:53.435
Hey there, you two.

1:04:53.476 --> 1:04:55.020
-Hi!
-Daryl tells me

1:04:55.061 --> 1:04:57.814
that Top Trends Magazine
was at the cottage today

1:04:57.856 --> 1:04:59.649
and they're doing
a cover story on you.

1:04:59.691 --> 1:05:01.317
Oh, no, it's not a cover story,

1:05:01.359 --> 1:05:04.320
it's really just
a small profile piece.

1:05:04.362 --> 1:05:05.655
Well, either way,
it's still exciting.

1:05:06.990 --> 1:05:08.199
Enjoy your evenings.

1:05:08.241 --> 1:05:11.119
Thanks.

1:05:11.161 --> 1:05:12.996
[hushed] Why didn't you
tell me those two were dating?

1:05:13.038 --> 1:05:14.998
I had no idea till just now.

1:05:16.583 --> 1:05:17.834
[indistinct exchange,
chuckling]

1:05:17.876 --> 1:05:20.295
It's true.

1:05:20.337 --> 1:05:23.590
Wow, it's a beautiful night.

1:05:23.631 --> 1:05:26.301
How about I walk you home?

1:05:26.343 --> 1:05:28.136
I don't know...

1:05:28.178 --> 1:05:30.013
it's a long way to Tribeca.

1:05:31.431 --> 1:05:33.975
You live in Tribeca?
I live in Tribeca!

1:05:34.017 --> 1:05:35.185
No!

1:05:35.226 --> 1:05:36.269
Yeah. I'm on Walker St.

1:05:36.311 --> 1:05:37.520
I'm on Reade!

1:05:37.562 --> 1:05:38.646
Come on.

1:05:38.688 --> 1:05:40.273
Wow!

1:05:40.315 --> 1:05:43.777
We had to come all the way
to Vermont to meet.

1:05:43.818 --> 1:05:46.404
It kinda makes me
like Vermont even more.

1:05:46.446 --> 1:05:48.948
[***]

1:05:51.534 --> 1:05:52.744
So are you still planning

1:05:52.786 --> 1:05:54.579
on sticking around here
for a while?

1:05:54.621 --> 1:05:56.456
Yeah, I was going to, but...

1:05:56.498 --> 1:05:57.999
I don't know.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:05:59.542
Now I'm starting to think that
maybe I should split my time

1:05:59.584 --> 1:06:02.545
between here and New York.

1:06:02.587 --> 1:06:05.632
Although, I do have to go
to New York in a couple of days,

1:06:05.674 --> 1:06:08.551
since my piece
is almost finally finished.

1:06:08.593 --> 1:06:10.679
I wish I could
come see your show.

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:12.013
Yeah.

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:13.848
But I will be here
getting ready for the wedding.

1:06:13.890 --> 1:06:15.141
Yeah.

1:06:15.183 --> 1:06:16.393
You know you're invited, right?

1:06:16.434 --> 1:06:18.770
And I intend on coming.

1:06:26.903 --> 1:06:28.905
Do you want to come in
for a nightcap?

1:06:31.074 --> 1:06:33.118
As much as I would love to...

1:06:34.744 --> 1:06:36.204
...I think I should head back
to the studio,

1:06:36.246 --> 1:06:38.581
'cause I just really want
to finish my sculpture tonight.

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:41.334
That's okay.

1:06:41.376 --> 1:06:44.129
Okay.

1:06:44.170 --> 1:06:45.714
Um...

1:06:45.755 --> 1:06:49.426
so I will see you first thing
tomorrow morning then--

1:06:49.467 --> 1:06:51.261
bright and early,
with coffee.

1:06:51.302 --> 1:06:53.304
I look forward to it every day.

1:06:53.346 --> 1:06:55.640
The "seeing you" part,
not the coffee.

1:06:55.682 --> 1:06:59.394
Right. Yeah,
because that would be weird.

1:06:59.436 --> 1:07:00.395
The coffee is not that good.

1:07:00.437 --> 1:07:01.354
Yeah, it's not...

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:05.608
[***]

1:07:17.495 --> 1:07:19.080
[chuckles]

1:07:20.373 --> 1:07:21.583
Goodnight.

1:07:23.543 --> 1:07:26.546
[***]

1:07:35.722 --> 1:07:39.601
[ringing]

1:07:39.642 --> 1:07:41.936
Hey. Listen,
before you say anything,

1:07:41.978 --> 1:07:44.898
I just finished the sculpture,
but, I have to warn you, it's--

1:07:44.939 --> 1:07:46.775
it's not like anything
I've ever done before.

1:07:46.816 --> 1:07:48.234
That's not why I'm calling.

1:07:48.276 --> 1:07:50.904
I've been getting calls
and texts about you all morning.

1:07:50.945 --> 1:07:52.364
Really? Why?

1:07:52.405 --> 1:07:53.782
Well, it seems

1:07:53.823 --> 1:07:56.868
that Top Trends Magazine
is doing a story

1:07:56.910 --> 1:07:58.703
saying that
you are down and out...

1:07:58.745 --> 1:08:01.581
uh, running a wedding cottage
in Vermont

1:08:01.623 --> 1:08:03.625
with someone
named Vanessa Doyle.

1:08:03.667 --> 1:08:05.126
I had no idea things
were so desperate.

1:08:05.168 --> 1:08:06.753
If you needed money,
all you had to do was ask.

1:08:06.795 --> 1:08:08.672
Whoa, whoa,
just back up a second.

1:08:08.713 --> 1:08:11.216
First off,
I don't need any money,

1:08:11.257 --> 1:08:12.550
and I am up here working.

1:08:12.592 --> 1:08:13.510
I'm not running
the wedding cottage--

1:08:13.551 --> 1:08:14.594
Vanessa is.

1:08:14.636 --> 1:08:16.596
And who is Vanessa?

1:08:16.638 --> 1:08:18.348
It's a bit of a long story,

1:08:18.390 --> 1:08:19.766
but she's this girl
that I started seeing.

1:08:19.808 --> 1:08:21.142
[stammers]

1:08:21.184 --> 1:08:23.561
I don't understand
how my name even got out there,

1:08:23.603 --> 1:08:26.314
let alone part of a story
that's so blatantly false.

1:08:26.356 --> 1:08:27.482
Well, they must have

1:08:27.524 --> 1:08:28.858
had a reporter up there
digging around.

1:08:28.900 --> 1:08:30.443
They've even got a photograph
of you on your bike.

1:08:30.485 --> 1:08:33.321
Yeah, there was someone here
doing a story about Vanessa,

1:08:33.363 --> 1:08:34.656
but I never talked to them.

1:08:34.698 --> 1:08:36.199
Well, it sounds like she did.

1:08:36.241 --> 1:08:38.159
This is-- This is all
starting to make sense.

1:08:38.201 --> 1:08:39.494
It is?

1:08:39.536 --> 1:08:41.579
Yeah. She's obviously

1:08:41.621 --> 1:08:43.873
using your name
to help out with her business.

1:08:45.291 --> 1:08:48.044
No. No, I-- I can't see her
doing something like that.

1:08:48.086 --> 1:08:49.254
But face the facts.

1:08:49.295 --> 1:08:51.423
Yeah, she's recently
opened a new business.

1:08:51.464 --> 1:08:52.507
You said yourself

1:08:52.549 --> 1:08:53.842
you only started dating,

1:08:53.883 --> 1:08:55.552
and she's using your name
as publicity.

1:08:55.593 --> 1:08:56.886
Unfortunately,

1:08:56.928 --> 1:08:58.471
it's not
the kind of publicity we need

1:08:58.513 --> 1:08:59.889
when we're trying
to reboot your career.

1:09:01.099 --> 1:09:03.643
[***]

1:09:09.733 --> 1:09:11.693
[***]

1:09:11.735 --> 1:09:12.819
Hi.

1:09:12.861 --> 1:09:14.195
Hey.

1:09:14.237 --> 1:09:15.655
Good to see you.

1:09:15.697 --> 1:09:17.991
Mm-hmm.

1:09:18.033 --> 1:09:19.451
You look like
you're all packed.

1:09:19.492 --> 1:09:21.911
Yeah. It's about time
I should head over to New York.

1:09:21.953 --> 1:09:25.290
Oh. I didn't realize
you were leaving so soon.

1:09:25.331 --> 1:09:26.374
Yeah.

1:09:26.416 --> 1:09:27.417
Does that mean
you finished your piece?

1:09:27.459 --> 1:09:29.002
I did.

1:09:29.044 --> 1:09:30.337
That's wonderful.

1:09:30.378 --> 1:09:32.547
Can I get a little sneak peek
before you go?

1:09:32.589 --> 1:09:34.215
Why?

1:09:34.257 --> 1:09:36.718
Do you want to take a picture
and show it to the journalist?

1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:38.386
[chuckles]

1:09:38.428 --> 1:09:40.305
Well, I would--
I would gladly do that for you.

1:09:43.475 --> 1:09:46.227
[hydraulics hum]

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:48.396
So, Top Trends Magazine...

1:09:48.438 --> 1:09:50.774
the article came out.

1:09:50.815 --> 1:09:52.567
Seems to be
the talk of the town.

1:09:52.609 --> 1:09:54.235
Already? Wow.

1:09:54.277 --> 1:09:55.862
Yeah, "wow".

1:09:55.904 --> 1:09:57.697
That was my reaction.

1:10:00.367 --> 1:10:02.160
Congratulations.

1:10:02.202 --> 1:10:04.037
Thanks.

1:10:04.079 --> 1:10:05.872
I hope this was all worth it
for you.

1:10:05.914 --> 1:10:07.415
[taken aback] It was.

1:10:07.457 --> 1:10:09.501
Um...

1:10:09.542 --> 1:10:11.836
I, uh... I should really
be heading back, okay?

1:10:11.878 --> 1:10:13.463
Okay, sure.

1:10:13.505 --> 1:10:15.131
Um...
Yeah. I brought you your coffee.

1:10:16.216 --> 1:10:17.759
Thanks.

1:10:17.801 --> 1:10:19.135
Safe travels.

1:10:19.177 --> 1:10:21.221
Okay.

1:10:26.351 --> 1:10:28.353
[engine starts]

1:10:29.938 --> 1:10:32.023
Jill, this is such a mess.

1:10:32.065 --> 1:10:33.566
I thought Evan was talking about

1:10:33.608 --> 1:10:36.319
the story the reporter did
on me and the wedding.

1:10:36.361 --> 1:10:38.738
I had no idea there was
a story about him, too,

1:10:38.780 --> 1:10:42.283
and now Evan somehow thinks
this is all my fault.

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:44.202
I'm guessing you already
tried calling him?

1:10:44.244 --> 1:10:45.829
And texting and emailing.

1:10:45.870 --> 1:10:47.247
He's just gone silent.

1:10:47.288 --> 1:10:49.958
Well, it is a long drive
from New York.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.292
Maybe he's being
a responsible driver

1:10:51.334 --> 1:10:53.128
and not
looking at his phone.

1:10:53.169 --> 1:10:55.255
What if he never wants
to speak to me again?

1:10:55.296 --> 1:10:57.590
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

1:10:57.632 --> 1:10:59.676
Why didn't he just ask me
about the reporter?

1:10:59.718 --> 1:11:01.136
He was angry,

1:11:01.177 --> 1:11:04.014
and probably
not thinking rationally.

1:11:04.055 --> 1:11:06.057
I think I should
just go back to New York

1:11:06.099 --> 1:11:08.226
and try to explain it to him
in person.

1:11:08.268 --> 1:11:10.020
Oh, but the wedding
is three days away,

1:11:10.061 --> 1:11:12.522
and we still have
a hundred things left to do.

1:11:12.564 --> 1:11:13.815
I know, but--

1:11:13.857 --> 1:11:14.816
I get it.

1:11:14.858 --> 1:11:15.650
You fell for him.

1:11:15.692 --> 1:11:17.152
I mean,

1:11:17.193 --> 1:11:19.404
I was the one who encouraged you
from the start.

1:11:19.446 --> 1:11:21.865
Maybe he just needs
some time.

1:11:21.906 --> 1:11:24.034
Maybe.

1:11:25.326 --> 1:11:28.288
Or maybe it just...
isn't meant to be.

1:11:32.083 --> 1:11:36.171
But Amy and Scott
are meant to be, so...

1:11:36.212 --> 1:11:40.467
so I'm just gonna forget
about all of this and...

1:11:40.508 --> 1:11:43.261
do my best to focus
on their perfect wedding.

1:11:44.387 --> 1:11:46.556
[***]

1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:08.495
You're right.

1:12:08.536 --> 1:12:11.414
This is... nothing like
you've ever done before.

1:12:17.128 --> 1:12:18.880
I think this is one of
your best pieces of work.

1:12:18.922 --> 1:12:20.840
It's exceptional!

1:12:20.882 --> 1:12:21.591
Oh, ho.

1:12:22.884 --> 1:12:25.637
I am so relieved
to hear you say that,

1:12:25.679 --> 1:12:27.222
and-and I have to be honest,

1:12:27.263 --> 1:12:29.224
as soon as I started
working with wood again,

1:12:29.265 --> 1:12:31.851
it just... it felt like
a step in the right direction.

1:12:31.893 --> 1:12:35.188
I guess hiding out in Vermont
was exactly what I needed.

1:12:35.230 --> 1:12:36.606
Well, looking at this piece,

1:12:36.648 --> 1:12:39.275
I don't think it was Vermont--
I think it was the girl.

1:12:39.317 --> 1:12:41.945
I mean, she might have
had a hidden agenda,

1:12:41.986 --> 1:12:43.113
but she was certainly
an inspiration.

1:12:44.114 --> 1:12:46.241
What are you calling the piece?

1:12:47.450 --> 1:12:50.412
I don't know.
I don't have a title for it yet.

1:12:50.453 --> 1:12:52.831
[both chuckling]

1:12:52.872 --> 1:12:55.834
[***]

1:12:57.293 --> 1:12:59.295
The caterers
should be here by noon,

1:12:59.337 --> 1:13:01.256
so if you could just get
the cake here around one,

1:13:01.297 --> 1:13:02.966
that would be great.

1:13:03.008 --> 1:13:05.760
And-And Amy decided to go with
the traditional wedding topper.

1:13:05.802 --> 1:13:07.554
Okay. Thanks, Nadine.

1:13:07.595 --> 1:13:09.472
Bye.

1:13:12.767 --> 1:13:14.936
That's it. We're done.

1:13:14.978 --> 1:13:16.688
Oh, my goodness.
Everything looks amazing.

1:13:16.730 --> 1:13:19.149
You and your guys
went above and beyond.

1:13:19.190 --> 1:13:20.900
Well, like I said
when you hired me--

1:13:20.942 --> 1:13:22.402
military guys
take care of each other.

1:13:22.444 --> 1:13:25.613
Well, thank you again.
We should settle up.

1:13:25.655 --> 1:13:26.656
Already taken care of.

1:13:27.991 --> 1:13:29.576
What do you mean?
I didn't pay you yet.

1:13:29.617 --> 1:13:30.660
Evan did...

1:13:30.702 --> 1:13:31.995
a few days before he left.

1:13:32.037 --> 1:13:34.539
Why would he do that?

1:13:34.581 --> 1:13:36.499
I asked him
the same thing myself.

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:38.001
He said

1:13:38.043 --> 1:13:39.127
he's really starting
to love the place.

1:13:39.169 --> 1:13:40.628
Might even stay on,

1:13:40.670 --> 1:13:41.880
and it only made sense

1:13:41.921 --> 1:13:43.506
for him to pay for it,
being that he owns it.

1:13:44.758 --> 1:13:46.176
Okay, but that's not right.

1:13:46.217 --> 1:13:48.511
You-Your contract
is with me.

1:13:48.553 --> 1:13:50.305
Yeah, it wouldn't be right
to get paid twice either.

1:13:50.347 --> 1:13:52.849
No.

1:13:52.891 --> 1:13:55.393
I-I just don't understand
what's happening here.

1:13:55.435 --> 1:13:57.479
Why wouldn't
he just talk to me first?

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.522
I think he wanted it
to be a surprise.

1:13:59.564 --> 1:14:02.984
Ah, he's just
full of surprises.

1:14:03.026 --> 1:14:04.611
Good surprises.

1:14:04.652 --> 1:14:07.572
Ah, talk to him about it
when he gets back.

1:14:09.699 --> 1:14:11.785
[mutters to self] Pretty sure
he's not coming back.

1:14:11.826 --> 1:14:14.537
[***]

1:14:16.664 --> 1:14:20.043
These are some of
the best reviews of your career.

1:14:20.085 --> 1:14:21.503
Congratulations, Evan.

1:14:21.544 --> 1:14:23.505
I wasn't sure
I'd ever get there again.

1:14:23.546 --> 1:14:25.173
Get there?
You're on top again.

1:14:25.215 --> 1:14:28.176
And offers for commissions
are rolling in.

1:14:28.218 --> 1:14:29.761
Well, without
your constant nagging,

1:14:29.803 --> 1:14:32.097
I probably never would've
finished this piece,

1:14:32.138 --> 1:14:34.683
so, thank you
for never giving up on me.

1:14:34.724 --> 1:14:36.184
You're welcome.

1:14:36.226 --> 1:14:37.936
I'm gonna keep nagging you
until you get back up to Vermont

1:14:37.977 --> 1:14:39.396
and start working again.

1:14:39.437 --> 1:14:41.815
Uh, I'm actually not gonna
be going back to Vermont.

1:14:41.856 --> 1:14:44.484
I've got a perfectly good studio
here in New York.

1:14:44.526 --> 1:14:46.069
Great. Keep you close to home.

1:14:46.111 --> 1:14:47.195
Let me sell some of your art.

1:14:47.237 --> 1:14:49.739
[***]

1:14:55.161 --> 1:14:56.830
[phone buzzing]

1:14:56.871 --> 1:14:57.747
Oh, sorry.

1:14:59.874 --> 1:15:01.042
Evan.

1:15:01.084 --> 1:15:02.752
What can I do for you?

1:15:02.794 --> 1:15:04.421
Hey. Uh, I've decided

1:15:04.462 --> 1:15:06.381
that I'm not gonna be
coming back to Vermont,

1:15:06.423 --> 1:15:08.216
so could you just do me a favor

1:15:08.258 --> 1:15:10.135
and close up the cottage
after the wedding?

1:15:10.176 --> 1:15:12.178
Really?

1:15:12.220 --> 1:15:13.930
After all the work we did?

1:15:13.972 --> 1:15:15.223
No, your--
your work is fine.

1:15:15.265 --> 1:15:16.725
You did an excellent job.

1:15:16.766 --> 1:15:19.185
I just...

1:15:19.227 --> 1:15:21.438
I don't belong
at the cottage anymore.

1:15:21.479 --> 1:15:24.315
Oh, that's too bad.

1:15:24.357 --> 1:15:26.443
Guess I spoke too soon
when I told that gal

1:15:26.484 --> 1:15:28.361
you were living
at the cottage, huh?

1:15:28.403 --> 1:15:30.739
Wait, what gal?

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:32.657
You know, the one that came
to interview Vanessa.

1:15:34.534 --> 1:15:37.454
You were the one who told her
that I was living there?

1:15:37.495 --> 1:15:40.331
Yeah, she saw you on your bike
and he asked me about ya.

1:15:40.373 --> 1:15:42.959
[***]

1:15:49.799 --> 1:15:53.053
[***]

1:15:57.390 --> 1:15:59.809
Rose's paintings
are a nice touch.

1:15:59.851 --> 1:16:02.228
They deserve
to be hanging here again.

1:16:02.270 --> 1:16:03.772
They're really charming.

1:16:03.813 --> 1:16:06.483
I can see where Evan
gets his talent from.

1:16:06.524 --> 1:16:08.401
I... I'm sorry.

1:16:08.443 --> 1:16:10.195
I didn't mean to bring him up.

1:16:10.236 --> 1:16:11.321
That's fine.

1:16:11.363 --> 1:16:14.199
After all, we are
standing in his cottage.

1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:15.617
Yeah, it's just too bad

1:16:15.658 --> 1:16:17.869
that this place isn't gonna
stay open for business.

1:16:17.911 --> 1:16:21.081
I mean, you did such
a spectacular job fixing it up.

1:16:21.122 --> 1:16:25.043
It really is
the perfect wedding cottage.

1:16:25.085 --> 1:16:28.588
Well, sadly, it's
the swan song for the cottage,

1:16:28.630 --> 1:16:31.091
and the swan song for me.

1:16:31.132 --> 1:16:35.387
This is my 235th
and final wedding.

1:16:35.428 --> 1:16:38.390
That's a shame, too.

1:16:38.431 --> 1:16:39.683
What do you mean?

1:16:39.724 --> 1:16:41.726
It's just...

1:16:41.768 --> 1:16:45.522
you shine every time
you plan a wedding.

1:16:45.563 --> 1:16:48.566
And there is no one who does it
better than you do.

1:16:48.608 --> 1:16:50.485
Thank you.
That means a lot.

1:16:50.527 --> 1:16:53.238
But this will give me more time
to focus on the website.

1:16:53.279 --> 1:16:54.447
Why?

1:16:54.489 --> 1:16:55.782
It's practically running itself.

1:16:56.658 --> 1:16:58.743
And thanks to the contest,

1:16:58.785 --> 1:17:01.246
Tying The Knot
is a bona fide hit.

1:17:01.287 --> 1:17:03.164
Mm. That may be true.

1:17:04.749 --> 1:17:09.337
Despite all of the chaos,
and close calls and...

1:17:09.379 --> 1:17:11.631
a little conniving...

1:17:11.673 --> 1:17:13.842
this wedding has been
fun to plan.

1:17:15.135 --> 1:17:18.304
Well, who says you have
to choose one over the other?

1:17:18.346 --> 1:17:20.515
[***]

1:17:29.649 --> 1:17:32.652
You look like
the perfect bride.

1:17:32.694 --> 1:17:34.529
How do you feel?

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:36.781
Nervous...

1:17:36.823 --> 1:17:39.492
but excited at the same time.

1:17:39.534 --> 1:17:40.744
Is that possible?

1:17:40.785 --> 1:17:42.412
Oh, it's so normal.

1:17:42.454 --> 1:17:45.623
That's how most brides feel
on their wedding day.

1:17:45.665 --> 1:17:47.417
You have your something old?

1:17:47.459 --> 1:17:49.377
My grandmother's locket.

1:17:49.419 --> 1:17:51.129
Something new?

1:17:51.171 --> 1:17:53.256
My hair clip.

1:17:53.298 --> 1:17:54.883
Something borrowed?

1:17:54.924 --> 1:17:57.802
Thank you, Vanessa,
for lending me your bracelet.

1:17:57.844 --> 1:18:00.055
And something blue?

1:18:01.389 --> 1:18:03.350
My mother's sapphires.

1:18:04.642 --> 1:18:07.604
Then I think you are ready
to walk down the aisle.

1:18:09.731 --> 1:18:11.900

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:30.251

* 'Cause you are the reason *

Scott, what--
what's wrong?

1:19:32.272 --> 1:19:35.233
[whispers]
I can't remember the moves.

1:19:35.275 --> 1:19:37.527
Okay. Um...

1:19:37.569 --> 1:19:39.863
* Please come back now... *

[hushed]
What are you doing here?

1:19:44.242 --> 1:19:46.703
I told you
I intended on being here.

1:19:46.745 --> 1:19:48.496
* ...And you are the reason *

1:19:48.538 --> 1:19:49.581
[whispers] Scott...

1:19:49.622 --> 1:19:51.916
just follow our lead,

1:19:51.958 --> 1:19:54.127
and don't look at anyone
except for Amy.

1:19:54.169 --> 1:19:57.422
* ...I'm hopeless now *

1:19:59.132 --> 1:20:01.968
* I'd climb every mountain *

1:20:03.595 --> 1:20:06.097
* And swim every ocean *

1:20:07.974 --> 1:20:11.186
* Just to be with you *

1:20:11.227 --> 1:20:16.066
* And fix what I've broken *

1:20:16.107 --> 1:20:18.276
-* Oh... *
-You know, this is

1:20:18.318 --> 1:20:20.612
the fourth time
you've taken me by surprise.

1:20:20.653 --> 1:20:21.946
Mm-hmm.

1:20:21.988 --> 1:20:23.782
Well, don't be surprised
if it happens again.

1:20:23.823 --> 1:20:26.743
Especially tonight.

1:20:26.785 --> 1:20:28.495
What else do you have in store?

1:20:28.536 --> 1:20:29.621
To start with...

1:20:29.662 --> 1:20:31.498
* I need you... *

1:20:31.539 --> 1:20:32.999
...an apology.

1:20:33.041 --> 1:20:34.959
* ...To see *

1:20:35.001 --> 1:20:37.170
I now know
that the magazine article

1:20:37.212 --> 1:20:40.048
didn't come from you.

1:20:40.090 --> 1:20:41.800
I'm glad we worked that out.

1:20:41.841 --> 1:20:43.843
I'm so sorry

1:20:43.885 --> 1:20:45.720
for running out
the way that I did.

1:20:45.762 --> 1:20:47.597
I never should've doubted you.

1:20:47.639 --> 1:20:49.057
I hope you can forgive me.

1:20:49.099 --> 1:20:50.350
How could I not?

1:20:50.392 --> 1:20:53.144
You just saved
their first dance.

1:20:53.186 --> 1:20:55.814
Well, you saved
the Wedding Cottage.

1:20:55.855 --> 1:20:58.608
[chuckles]
It was worth it.

1:20:58.650 --> 1:21:00.819
This place is magical.

1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:03.822
Well, I know
my grandparents would agree,

1:21:03.863 --> 1:21:06.366
especially since
it brought us together.

1:21:08.618 --> 1:21:10.495
I'm sorry, did I...

1:21:10.537 --> 1:21:12.747
-[Evan chuckles]
-...did I mishear you?

1:21:12.789 --> 1:21:13.998
Come on!

1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:17.085
It sounded like you said
we're together?

1:21:19.170 --> 1:21:22.007
Is that too big
of an assumption?

1:21:22.048 --> 1:21:24.217
Not as far
as I'm concerned.

1:21:24.259 --> 1:21:25.385
Okay.

1:21:26.511 --> 1:21:29.431
I just wanted
to clear that up, too.

1:21:29.472 --> 1:21:31.182
Come here.

1:21:31.224 --> 1:21:32.559
There's something
I want to show you.

1:21:36.813 --> 1:21:40.567
[***]

1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:48.783
Evan...

1:21:48.825 --> 1:21:50.285
this is your new piece.

1:21:50.326 --> 1:21:51.786
[gasps]

1:21:51.828 --> 1:21:52.954
It's amazing.

1:21:52.996 --> 1:21:55.373
It's...

1:21:55.415 --> 1:21:58.293
earthy and warm,
and romantic...

1:22:00.211 --> 1:22:01.713
It's just like you.

1:22:04.507 --> 1:22:06.676
And I love it.

1:22:06.718 --> 1:22:09.095
That makes it all worthwhile.

1:22:11.848 --> 1:22:13.391
So what's it doing here?

1:22:13.433 --> 1:22:15.852
I thought it was supposed to be
in a show in New York.

1:22:15.894 --> 1:22:17.062
It was.

1:22:17.103 --> 1:22:18.688
But then I...

1:22:18.730 --> 1:22:21.483
I just realized I couldn't
bring myself to sell it.

1:22:23.985 --> 1:22:25.779
Because it belongs here.

1:22:27.322 --> 1:22:28.615
So do I.

1:22:28.656 --> 1:22:31.451
[***]

1:22:33.953 --> 1:22:35.246
Does that mean

1:22:35.288 --> 1:22:38.249
you're going to reopen
the Wedding Cottage?

1:22:38.291 --> 1:22:40.585
Well, you know, I would
need a partner for that.

1:22:40.627 --> 1:22:44.297
Do you know anyone out there
that likes weddings?

1:22:44.339 --> 1:22:45.674
I don't.

1:22:45.715 --> 1:22:47.425
Tch. [sighs]

1:22:47.467 --> 1:22:50.011
But I do know someone
who loves them.

1:22:50.053 --> 1:22:51.262
Oh.

1:22:51.304 --> 1:22:52.889
Well, is she available?

1:22:52.931 --> 1:22:55.433
Hmm.

1:22:55.475 --> 1:22:56.976
She might be.

1:22:57.018 --> 1:22:59.062
Yeah?

1:22:59.104 --> 1:23:02.691
And she is going to have
an incredible new story

1:23:02.732 --> 1:23:04.943
to add to the next edition
of her guide book.

1:23:04.984 --> 1:23:06.444
Oh, you mean the entry

1:23:06.486 --> 1:23:07.946
that was never supposed
to be there in the first place?

1:23:07.987 --> 1:23:08.905
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:23:10.532 --> 1:23:12.659
It's really funny
how things work out.

1:23:14.452 --> 1:23:16.287
There's always
a happily-ever-after

1:23:16.329 --> 1:23:17.455
at the Wedding Cottage.
