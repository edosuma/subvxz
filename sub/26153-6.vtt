WEBVTT

00:08.466 --> 00:10.301
Yo, this my main man Lou right here.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.513
You know what it is.
Most assists on the team, most passes.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.141
He inbound the ball, I take it forecourt,
and I score...

00:16.224 --> 00:18.309
-but they count it as an assist for him.
-Whatever.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.770
A dime a dime.
I give it to you, you make the shit.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.983
[Tillman] Look, Lou's a good guy.
I mean, he's always there for me.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.152
It's a deeper relationship,
it's more so like family.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.445
Like, Lou like my brother

00:28.528 --> 00:30.530
Don't get me wrong,
I love all the kids here,

00:30.613 --> 00:32.782
but I kind of look at it
like I'm a parent.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.742
[Lu] Right.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.244
So he kinda like the uncle
to the students.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.913
Mm-hm. I whoop they ass
when they get out of line.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.249
[laughs] It's cool, though. That's my man.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.917
I wouldn't do anything without this dude.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
[Peter] In the 12 hours of footage
we acquired

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
from the camera in Kevin's locker,

01:27.253 --> 01:31.966
it seemed clear that the teachers' lounge
was strictly off-limits to all students.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.510
Except one.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.893
Lou uses my key card once a day.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.438
He heats up DeMarcus' pre-packaged food
in the teachers' lounge.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.610
[coach] Look, everything
about DeMarcus' life is regulated.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.695
His training is regulated.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.572
His rest periods are regulated.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.950
His caloric intake is regulated.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.411
He doesn't get to where he's gotten
by eating chicken fingers and tater tots.

02:00.995 --> 02:04.707
So, that's why Lou goes
into the teachers' lounge

02:04.791 --> 02:06.501
to heat up the prepackaged food.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.962
Lou has daily access to the lounge,

02:09.254 --> 02:11.047
which means he had access
on December 4th.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.341
[Sam]
Yeah, the day fucking Fernandez ate shit.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.552
And Lou is an extension of DeMarcus.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.471
Maybe that explains
why DeMarcus doesn't have the glitch.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.015
[Sam] So you think that they did
the Turd Burglar account off,

02:21.099 --> 02:22.058
of Lou's phone?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.728
[Kevin] Right. It makes sense to me.
They basically do everything together.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.649
[Kevin] Lou's assistance would answer
one of the largest lingering questions

02:29.732 --> 02:31.025
about the DeMarcus theory.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.735
On November 2nd,

02:32.819 --> 02:35.321
the Turd Burglar had the Apple iOS glitch,

02:35.905 --> 02:37.157
but DeMarcus didn't.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.243
So there's no way the Turd Burglar posts

02:40.326 --> 02:42.328
could have been made
from DeMarcus' phone.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.707
But they could have been made
from Lou's phone.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.709
Because on November 2nd,

02:48.251 --> 02:49.794
Lou did have the glitch.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.423
So this was a two-man job.
DeMarcus is the Turd Burglar,

02:53.506 --> 02:55.091
with Lou along for the assists.

02:56.968 --> 03:01.931
Got to school right on time yet again.
Another assist for my boy Lou!

03:02.056 --> 03:03.391
[Lou grunts]

03:04.017 --> 03:06.436
Lou does everything for DeMarcus.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.854
Lou's like a chauffeur.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.064
Except a chauffeur gets paid.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.108
Lou says they're like Batman and Robin,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.694
but they're more
like Batman and Alfred.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.362
-[girl] In literature--
-Uh-oh!

03:16.446 --> 03:18.448
Lou with the assist. No more sniffles.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.325
[students chattering]

03:20.450 --> 03:23.077
You know what DeMarcus' alibi
always seemed, you know,

03:23.161 --> 03:25.413
-sort of shitty to me.
-Oh, very shitty.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.498
Coach Devlin vouches for him, but,
I don't know,

03:27.582 --> 03:29.417
that's never seemed all that reliable.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.920
No, and DeMarcus clearly
had the access he needed

03:32.003 --> 03:33.796
to have committed
the first three crimes.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.883
And now that we know that Lou
has access to the teachers' lounge,

03:36.966 --> 03:38.676
all four crimes make sense.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.595
[huffs] Yeah, but what about motive?

03:41.179 --> 03:42.972
Listen, I still think that it's a prank.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.475
I mean, the school
and the police made it seem

03:45.558 --> 03:47.644
like it was this dark, vengeful crime.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.772
We're looking for a student
that's alienated

03:50.855 --> 03:52.357
by the rest of the school.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.651
[Peter] But DeMarcus isn't bullied.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.403
And I don't even think
that Kevin sees himself as bullied.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.572
I love being the Fruit Ninja.
I love making the videos.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.324
It's fun. It's a creative outlet.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.700
Two-fruit combo.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.162
So I don't think these were crimes
committed by a lone wolf.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.997
[Peter] This wasn't about revenge.

04:08.623 --> 04:12.585
I think that DeMarcus and Lou
created the Turd Burglar just as a prank.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.630
This was the act of two friends
who feared no consequences.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.299
-These are my people! This is my world!
-Think about it.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.760
DeMarcus walks these halls
like he can get away with anything.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.804
Hello.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.764
Hey, what's up?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.307
I'm sorry. My bad.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.101
I got to take this. Huh?

04:29.018 --> 04:30.311
I'm in class right now.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.523
Hold on.
Go ahead, you can keep teaching.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.943
That's not a question for me.
That's a Lou question.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.653
You gotta ask Lou that.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.071
Just call his phone.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.573
Hey Lou. It's my dad.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.786
To me, this is just DeMarcus
raising the stakes on Sir Fucks-a-lot.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.038
Think about how elaborate
those pranks were.

04:49.122 --> 04:53.251
Costumes, Photoshop, props,
an online Instagram.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.420
-[Sam] You're right.
-And Perry set a precedent.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.881
Athletes pull off offensive pranks,
and they get away with them.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
Get this. If I was DeMarcus and Lou,

05:01.217 --> 05:03.594
I would probably go to Perry
for advice, right?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.972
Since Perry has experience
with pulling pranks,

05:06.055 --> 05:08.474
and setting up online accounts,
aliases.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.894
-So, maybe Perry knows something we don't.
-We should interview him.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.897
Maybe he knows something,
you know, concrete.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.107
[Peter] Yeah.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.863
[Peter] Testing, testing.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.656
[incoming video call]

05:24.365 --> 05:25.450
-Perry.
-Yeah.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.951
-Hi, how are you?
-Good, how are you?

05:27.035 --> 05:29.245
Thanks for sitting down with me.
I really appreciate this.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.246
Yeah.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.206
And you're cool with us
recording this interview?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.624
-Do what you need to do.
-Awesome.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.710
So let's start off
with you telling me a little bit

05:35.793 --> 05:37.670
about your relationship
with DeMarcus.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.380
Aw, D? DeMarcus, us family.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.008
I mean, he a good ball player,
he's funny as fuck.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.468
That's my little brother.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.553
So you guys could obviously
confide in one another?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.639
Yeah, I mean, we was air tight
when I was at St. B.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.100
[Sam] Are you not as tight anymore, then?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.353
-Who was that?
-Oh, sorry.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.104
-My name is Sam.
-This is my co-producer.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.189
Nice to meet you, Sam.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.358
-Nice to meet you.
-What's going on, Sam?

05:58.566 --> 06:03.154
So, you were saying that you and DeMarcus
are not as close anymore.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.572
Yeah. [sighs]

06:05.031 --> 06:05.865
Why?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.617
Because of Lou.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.162
But from my understanding,
Lou is like DeMarcus' butler,

06:11.245 --> 06:12.497
like his assistant, no?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.207
[laughs] Brah wish.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.042
Lou runs the DeMarcus show.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.835
He's pulling all the strings
behind camera.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.547
How so? Could you mind
explaining that a little bit?

06:21.631 --> 06:25.593
Look, Lou and D's dad want DeMarcus
to go play in Oregon or some shit.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.637
So they feel like if he's hanging with me,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.222
I'm gon' brainwash him
to come to UCLA.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.307
So they do whatever they can
to keep us apart.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.768
So you're saying
that Lou controls DeMarcus.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.685
Exactly.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.312
When we were in town
playing Washington,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.481
Lou literally called the cops

06:38.564 --> 06:40.900
on a party me and DeMarcus
was going to.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.777
He goes to great lengths

06:42.860 --> 06:44.570
just to keep DeMarcus
under his wing.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.366
Wait, what party was that?

06:49.617 --> 06:50.576
Skip Day.

06:53.204 --> 06:57.917
[Peter] In a group text between DeMarcus,
Lou, and Perry at 1:21 p.m.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.629
Perry texts, "Leaving now.
Be there in 30,"

07:01.838 --> 07:03.881
and shares his lift route with the guys.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.135
One minute later, at 1:22 p.m.,

07:07.468 --> 07:10.096
DeMarcus responds,
"See you soon."

07:10.596 --> 07:12.306
Then, at 1:33,

07:12.598 --> 07:15.435
while Perry is still in his lift
on the way to the party,

07:15.726 --> 07:16.894
Lou responds,

07:17.019 --> 07:19.439
"Hey, don't bother. The cops are here."

07:20.898 --> 07:25.027
Skip Day is well documented
because of the Great American Challenge.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.487
And from the footage,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.907
it's clear
that the party is still going on at 1:33,

07:29.991 --> 07:31.826
with no signs of the police.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.703
Finally,

07:33.786 --> 07:37.290
the police arrive to break up the party
at 1:39;

07:37.790 --> 07:41.669
a full six minutes
after Lou's text to Perry.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.964
Dude knew the cops were coming
way before anybody was talking about 12.

07:45.047 --> 07:48.050
Don't let the act fool you.
Lou's smarter than you think.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.887
[Peter] Perry believes
that Lou saw him as a threat,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.305
so much so,

07:52.597 --> 07:55.725
that he called the police
to keep Perry away from DeMarcus.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.145
And from this partygoer's video
from 1:23,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.481
we can see two things.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.565
First,

08:03.399 --> 08:05.818
we see Tanner and Chloe
making out;

08:06.110 --> 08:08.738
perhaps the real reason
Tanner was so upset

08:08.863 --> 08:11.365
that Skip Day was broken up early.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.534
And we can also see

08:13.743 --> 08:15.995
that Perry appears to be right
about Lou.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.915
[Perry] He been hittin' licks off
withÂ DeMarcus for years.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.583
What's "hitting licks"?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.126
Using him for clout.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.253
Ever since he knew DeMarcus
was gonna be a star,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.172
he's been that way,
in every aspect.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.174
Look, when it comes to females,

08:28.257 --> 08:30.843
Lou talks to girls
that's just way out of his league,

08:30.927 --> 08:33.846
but he does so because, you know,
he's in proximity to DeMarcus.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.849
If you wanna get with DeMarcus,
you gotta get with his friend.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.559
It's some real Spice Girl shit, man.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.728
[Perry] And on top of that,

08:40.811 --> 08:43.314
all the recruiters know
that Lou is the inside man,

08:43.397 --> 08:45.775
so they do whatever they can
to please Lou

08:45.858 --> 08:48.194
because they want DeMarcus that bad.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.445
He's a leech, bro.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.405
[Peter] In your opinion,

08:51.697 --> 08:54.492
do you think it's possible
that Lou and DeMarcus

08:54.575 --> 08:55.910
could be the Turd Burglars?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.286
Like maybe,

08:57.495 --> 09:00.039
DeMarcus saw this as, like,
a funny prank or something,

09:00.122 --> 09:01.874
kind of like your Sir Fucks-a-lot.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.962
[laughs] Oh my God.
There's no fucking way.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.589
Lou would never let D do
a prank like that.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.466
He's just to invested in his business.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
This Turd Burglar shit is funny, man,

09:12.635 --> 09:17.014
but Lou would never let D
get in trouble.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.849
That's his meal ticket.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.977
That's just crazy.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.979
[Sam] I believe Perry.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.691
I just don't think that Lou
would ever commit any of these crimes.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.902
Then maybe DeMarcus did it on his own.
And why do you believe Perry so much?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.321
-They're best friends.
-'Cause he brings up some good points.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.699
DeMarcus kind of lives
under Lou's microscope,

09:34.782 --> 09:36.826
and DeMarcus is Lou's business.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.870
So, I don't think Lou would let DeMarcus
commit these crimes.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.165
But Chloe said that she saw
the Turd Burglar card in DeMarcus' wallet.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.167
I know. Pete, you keep bringing that up.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.669
[Peter] But that's a valid point--

09:46.752 --> 09:48.045
Sure, but, look,

09:48.129 --> 09:50.214
we're kind of just running off
Chloe's word here.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.759
I know those eyes.
Those are the Turd Burglar eyes.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.555
[Sam] And I'm not saying she's unreliable,
but she could be mis-remembering.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.056
That could have been a yogurt card.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.934
It's got a chocolate swirl on it,
and it looks like shit.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.645
I mean, they don't really realize that,
but everyone else seeing it,

10:04.729 --> 10:05.896
like, it looks like shit.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.815
[Peter] DeMarcus has endless access.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.067
-[Sam] But I'm telling you--
-He has no alibi.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.986
And he acts like he's above the law.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.738
If Perry's telling the truth,

10:13.821 --> 10:16.657
then Lou would never let DeMarcus
commit these crimes, ever.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.242
Maybe we should
interview them together.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.910
Maybe there's something
they're not telling us.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.954
It's not like one of them's
just gonna crack,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.789
and then point the finger at the other.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.917
Yeah, but we finally know something
that can drive a wedge between them.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.503
-What are you talking about?
-Skip Day.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.426
Okay, we'd like to show
you guys something if you have a moment.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.928
-Yeah, what's up?
-You and Lou also.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
-Yo, Lou.
-Huh?

10:39.513 --> 10:40.973
They trying to interview us.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.559
You're trash. Come on, man.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.312
This is a photo of the both of you guys
at Skip Day.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.982
Ey yo, you see the video
when dude threw up on Shorty Marr?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.442
What's buddy's name?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.277
Andrew Lundgarden! You see that?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.404
-[Sam] I saw that video.
-You saw it, right?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.739
-[Sam] That was hilarious.
-Shh.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.158
You really just shush him?

10:59.450 --> 11:00.409
That's crazy.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.536
I ain't know people really shush
outside of libraries.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.955
That was disrespectful-ass
motherfucker, man.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.707
Were you guys there
when the police arrived?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.712
What has this got to do
with the Turd Burglar?

11:11.796 --> 11:12.797
It's related.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.758
I mean, we ducked out
right before they got there.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.344
Well, you'll see here...

11:19.011 --> 11:20.596
that the police don't arrive...

11:21.055 --> 11:22.556
until 1:39 p.m.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.142
So?

11:25.559 --> 11:26.394
And this...

11:26.852 --> 11:30.064
is a picture of Lou
on his phone, 16 minutes earlier.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.234
What you saying?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.945
Well, I know that everybody
in the school believes

11:36.028 --> 11:38.406
that it was Kevin who made
the phone call to the police.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.867
Actually, they use that phone call
as one of Kevin's primary motivations,

11:41.951 --> 11:43.619
as to why he became the Turd Burglar.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.454
You even went
as far as to call the police

11:45.538 --> 11:47.748
to get a Skip Day party canceled,
didn't you?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.418
[Peter] But I don't believe it was Kevin
who made that call.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.920
I think it was Lou
who made the phone call.

11:55.923 --> 11:56.882
This real?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.009
This is bullshit.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.762
I ain't call the cops. Why would I?

12:02.138 --> 12:05.015
[Peter] Well, actually it's been suggested
from multiple sources

12:05.307 --> 12:06.976
that you didn't want DeMarcus
hanging out

12:07.059 --> 12:08.769
with Perry Coleman on Skip Day

12:08.853 --> 12:11.355
because you don't want
DeMarcus going to UCLA.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.567
But we thought
that if you didn't make the phone call,

12:14.650 --> 12:17.695
that we'd give you the opportunity
to show us your call log from that day.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.823
What's up, Lou? Show your call log.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.283
-No.
-Show you ain't call the cops.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.451
[Lou shouts] Fuck that!

12:25.745 --> 12:26.787
Alright, man.

12:27.121 --> 12:27.955
Fuck that.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.167
Look, man, I don't know
what you getting at.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
If Lou called the cops, he was probably
just trying to help me out.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.922
Lou, if you let Kevin go down
for making that call,

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
what else would you let him
take the fall for?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.593
What the fuck are you talking about?

12:40.676 --> 12:43.095
There was a fourth crime
in the teachers' lounge.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.931
-I don't know nothing about that.
-Are you sure?

12:50.519 --> 12:53.105
We only found one student
with access to a key card.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.648
Bro, he warm up my lunch
and that it.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.025
[Lou] Who you been talking to?

12:56.108 --> 12:56.984
[Peter] Hmm?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.236
Somebody on the fucking team?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.030
[Tillman] Look, man, we done for now.
A'ight?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.490
-Come on, let's go.
-Who?

13:02.573 --> 13:04.074
I can't reveal my sources.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.076
Lou. Let's go, man.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.832
-Who you been talking to?
-Hey, Lou!

13:12.750 --> 13:13.793
Let's go!

13:16.086 --> 13:17.630
[Sam] Alright, let's get out of here.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.591
[Peter] No confession.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
No new leads.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.303
Confronting Lou with our evidence,

13:24.386 --> 13:27.598
may not have cast a shadow of guilt
on DeMarcus Tillman...

13:29.016 --> 13:32.394
...but our digging into Skip Day
did cast another ray of innocence...

13:32.520 --> 13:33.896
on Kevin McLean.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.067
-Yeah, there we go.
-That's it.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.110
-Alright.
-So it's just that. Down there.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.863
So, we wanted to show you something
regarding Skip Day.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.074
So as you can see in this footage
right here...

13:45.157 --> 13:46.492
-Right.
-...we see--

13:47.743 --> 13:49.245
I don't know what that has to do with--

13:49.328 --> 13:51.080
No, we're not talking about that.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.875
We're talking about here,
you see Lou on the phone at 1:23 p.m.,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.002
at Skip Day.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.755
Then we had
this text message conversation

13:59.839 --> 14:01.590
between Lou, DeMarcus, and Perry.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.509
Now, Perry was on his way to Skip Day

14:03.592 --> 14:05.553
when he received this message
from Lou,

14:05.636 --> 14:07.638
saying don't come
because the police are here.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.101
But we know that the police
actually don't arrive until 1:39 p.m.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.272
So Lou knew about the police coming
a whole six minutes earlier,

14:16.564 --> 14:17.481
which means that--

14:17.565 --> 14:18.440
Kevin...

14:19.233 --> 14:20.734
Kevin didn't call the cops.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.152
Right.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.445
Lou did.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.411
Does that change anything for you?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.538
[students partying]

14:40.337 --> 14:43.048
So Perry was already in the lift,
on his way to Skip Day,

14:43.424 --> 14:46.302
when Lou texts him at 1:33 p.m.,
right here,

14:46.385 --> 14:47.928
-saying that the cops are here.
-Mm-hm.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.389
But from the found footage that we found
from Skip Day,

14:50.472 --> 14:54.602
we know if the police don't arrive
until actually right here, 1:39 p.m.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.397
And these are the actual text exchange
between Lou, DeMarcus, and Perry.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.401
[Sam]And we have footage of Lou
on his phone about 16 minutes earlier.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.028
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.031
It's just that... Yeah.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.825
It's just there are some moments in here
that you may not want to see.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.411
So, if you want, you can
take my word for it that we have--

15:12.494 --> 15:15.331
Peter, thank you,
but I am not in high school anymore.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.834
I'm an adult, so no trigger warnings
necessary. [laughs]

15:18.918 --> 15:19.835
You sure?

15:20.127 --> 15:21.003
-Peter.
-Okay.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.964
-Oh, that's Lou?
-Yeah.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.091
[students partying]

15:27.801 --> 15:29.762
And that's him calling the cops.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.140
I am enjoying this moment. [chuckles]

15:35.476 --> 15:37.561
-Alright...
-Wait, that's Chloe.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.271
And Tanner.

15:39.855 --> 15:40.689
But...

15:42.983 --> 15:43.859
So...

15:44.193 --> 15:45.027
Okay.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.821
With tongue.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.494
This doesn't concern me.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.536
Okay, perfect.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.789
So you can see he's on his phone
16 minutes earlier.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.792
Lou denies it, but you can see
that Lou was on his phone.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.336
[Kevin huffs]

16:02.419 --> 16:03.629
-You okay?
-Uh-huh.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.507
-They hot?
-Uh-huh.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.424
Oh.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.053
[Peter] A kiss with tongue.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.222
A canceled Skip Day.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.475
A broken friendship.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.395
Perhaps the guilt of a secret hook-up

16:19.478 --> 16:22.356
helped energize Chloe to protect Kevin
in the first place.

16:22.439 --> 16:23.565
-[teacher] Hi, Chloe.
-Hi.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.694
[Peter] Only to be rebuked by the friend
she was trying to protect.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.445
And frankly, I don't really know

16:28.529 --> 16:31.407
why you're pretending
to care so much all of a sudden.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.867
Kevin, we're friends.

16:34.034 --> 16:34.910
Are we?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.288
[Peter] And it was Tanner's accusation
that Kevin called the cops,

16:38.998 --> 16:41.333
which we now know to be untrue,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.669
that led to Tanner's dismissal
from the band.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.629
Then two days later,

16:45.963 --> 16:49.341
Tanner testified against his best friend
to the Bellevue Police.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.470
It was a three-way friendship
since fourth grade,

16:54.388 --> 16:56.974
and it came apart at the seams
on Skip Day.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.393
Leaving Kevin at home,

16:59.560 --> 17:00.602
on house arrest,

17:01.603 --> 17:02.980
desperate for a friend.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.899
[Kevin] Now, a technique I use.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.527
-You sip a little into your mouth.
-[Myles slurping]

17:09.403 --> 17:11.780
While still holding it in your mouth,

17:12.448 --> 17:14.992
you breathe in,
you're trying to create a vapor,

17:15.576 --> 17:19.079
so that you may fill your entire mouth
with the flavors.

17:19.663 --> 17:20.622
It's better.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.082
-[Kevin] It is.
-It is.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.168
-[door-bell rings]
-[Myles slurping]

17:31.633 --> 17:33.177
-Mr. Bassett.
-Hi, Kevin.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.511
How may I help you?

17:35.137 --> 17:39.767
I'd love to talk, if that's cool?
Uh. Peter said you'd be here.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.519
I'm always here.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.064
Here, I got you this tea.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.274
You had mentioned it
in one of your videos.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.694
The Arya Pearl Darjeeling White.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.491
I spoke of the 2016 harvest,
not the 2017.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.450
Oh...

17:56.700 --> 17:58.577
Sorry, dude. Is that one no good?

18:00.120 --> 18:00.954
No.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.249
I've heard the 2017 is quite excellent.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.460
Better, even.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.420
So...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.339
Look, Kevin I just...

18:12.049 --> 18:15.803
I wanted to say I'm sorry
that I accused you of calling the cops.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.431
But, I mean, I got that text from you
and it had the pin,

18:19.515 --> 18:21.642
and then 15 minutes later
the cops showed up,

18:21.725 --> 18:23.060
-so I just assumed--
-Yes.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.646
That is called an unfortunate coincidence.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.482
I know, I just... Look, I fucked up.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.401
All these things are
snowballing together, I mean, I just...

18:32.111 --> 18:34.279
I just, I thought the horchata thing
was weird,

18:34.363 --> 18:37.241
I thought our trip to Dawsey's was weird.

18:37.866 --> 18:41.328
[Tanner] I mean, I guess I thought
you were hiding things from me.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.581
I know you saw the Chloe footage.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.500
Oh, yes. [clears throat]

18:47.126 --> 18:49.586
I'm very happy for you two lovebirds.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.090
She won't even talk to me anymore,
because of what I did to you.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.135
[Tanner] But she's right to be mad.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.428
And you're right to be mad,
because...

19:00.722 --> 19:02.349
what I did was unforgivable.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.396
-[car honks]
-[Myles] That's my mom.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.899
[Kevin sighs] Alright.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.402
See ya, Kevin.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.904
Great work today, bro.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.531
-Bye, Molly.
-Thank you, Myles.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.195
Hey, who you been talking to
about Lou and D?

19:58.113 --> 20:00.073
-DeMarcus.
-[Sam] Oh, Perry Coleman.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.162
Yeah, well, he thinks
you been talking to me.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.122
So let's get talking.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.375
Chloe... [huffs]

20:10.792 --> 20:13.921
[takes a deep breath]
She was telling the truth.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.842
She saw the Turd Burglar card
in DeMarcus' wallet.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.344
I saw it, too.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.680
And I tried to do the right thing,
I told the team.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.724
And they didn't believe me.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.937
Four days later,
we were at the pep rally.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.482
The team's supposed to be there
30 minutes early for the walk-through,

20:33.565 --> 20:34.942
but Lou and DeMarcus weren't.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.906
I see Lou and DeMarcus run in
at the last second.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.032
[fans cheering]

20:42.157 --> 20:43.325
The team sees it too.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.829
So, when shit started flying,
it was pretty obvious,

20:47.913 --> 20:49.122
you know, where they'd been.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.168
They're in the equipment room
putting shit in all the launchers.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.425
And that's when the team, you know,
they started believing me,

21:00.509 --> 21:03.303
and they started pointing fingers
at Lou and DeMarcus.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.100
But then... our captain, Tyler Ramsden,

21:08.392 --> 21:10.477
he sent an email to the rest of the team.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.772
He basically told us to lie.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.775
An email from Tyler Ramsden.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.319
"Just to refresh everyone's memory,

21:19.778 --> 21:22.739
DeMarcus and Lou
were at the walk-through.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.658
Do you have dementia?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.368
I'm not joking.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.620
If you remember otherwise,

21:28.704 --> 21:30.706
report to me after practice

21:30.789 --> 21:32.666
with whether or not you
have dementia.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.002
Maybe I can refresh your memory.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.880
They.. were... with... us.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.217
We don't need the best player
in the country getting bad press

21:42.342 --> 21:44.428
because of your shitty memories."

21:44.511 --> 21:46.263
You know, we all know they did it.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.889
But then, two days later...

21:48.974 --> 21:50.183
...Kevin confessed.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.853
It was kinda weird.
I'm not gonna lie, I was confused.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.857
[Kevin] I did the thing at the pep rally.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.401
But then one visit from Lou,

21:59.484 --> 22:00.777
it put that all to rest.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.698
He came to me.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.660
He accused me of talking to you.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.999
He told me that there was never
any Turd Burglar card...

22:14.624 --> 22:15.709
in DeMarcus' wallet.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.130
He told me that he and DeMarcus were,

22:20.213 --> 22:22.716
you know, at the walk-through
before the pep rally.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.427
He says if I get
those two facts straight,

22:26.303 --> 22:27.721
we won't have any problems.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.600
I tell him to go fuck himself.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.439
He hits me square.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.067
He kicks me while I'm down.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.028
See, that's what happens with the team.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.489
If they want you to stop talking,

22:46.656 --> 22:47.741
they shut you up.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.578
"We don't need the best player
in the country getting bad press

22:51.661 --> 22:53.330
because of your shitty memories."

22:53.872 --> 22:55.415
-It's a cover-up.
-Oh my God, yes,

22:55.499 --> 22:57.167
and it has to be Lou and DeMarcus.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.420
[Sam] Yeah, I mean... Or at least someone
on the basketball team.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.089
I'm messaging the Turd Burglar.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.716
Are you happy...

23:04.800 --> 23:09.179
the entire basketball team...

23:10.263 --> 23:14.101
agreed to let Kevin...

23:14.476 --> 23:16.103
take the fall?

23:17.771 --> 23:18.605
Alright.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.234
Oh, dude, three dots.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.985
-[Sam] Hmm? Really?
-Yeah.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.029
Three dots. He's responding.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.281
Let me see.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.951
[Sam] "You're onto something, Peter.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.037
Maybe they did let Kevin
take the fall.

23:34.121 --> 23:37.082
Or maybe Kevin was in on it
the whole time."

23:38.166 --> 23:40.252
-What is he...?
-What does that mean?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.129
[Sam] "You want to know the truth?

23:42.921 --> 23:43.922
Here it is."

23:44.881 --> 23:46.383
Oh, that's a link.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.263
[farting while shitting]

23:52.931 --> 23:53.765
Eww.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.643
Dude, I told you.
We should have been sending

23:56.726 --> 23:59.396
poop puns this whole time.
If we were speaking his language,

23:59.563 --> 24:01.398
maybe we would have gotten
across to him better.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.818
[Peter] No, I think this is good.
This means he's dodging questions.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.028
It means that he's nervous
and we're getting somewhere.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.101
[Peter] See, that's what happens...

24:38.393 --> 24:39.603
with the team.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.439
If they want you to stop talking,

24:43.565 --> 24:44.733
they shut you up.
