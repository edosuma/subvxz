WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:05.130
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

00:05.320 --> 00:08.005
Every time I bring her up,
you end up evading it.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.400
You killed Sara.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.849
And I don't want you to tell anyone
about this, especially Laurel.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.929
How could you have done this to me?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.963
- Please do not do this. Not here...
- Stop.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.208
I will work with you to stop Ra's.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.689
But never again will I be your daughter.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.327
Oliver Queen is still alive.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.086
Somehow Ta-er al-Sahfer's killer
still yet breathes.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.568
Yes, I know.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.882
He has returned to
Starling City, apparently.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.923
Why did you not tell me?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.805
I had a right to know
that justice has not been done.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.367
Because Oliver Queen
did not murder Ta-er al-Sahfer.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.809
Do you not believe his own confession
because you doubt his motives?

01:12.320 --> 01:14.561
Or because you don't approve of my grief?

01:14.760 --> 01:17.730
- Sara was your beloved.
- And you've never approved.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.601
I knew Sara would leave us, leave you...

01:22.320 --> 01:24.004
...one way or the other.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.245
I didn't approve of the love that I knew
would end only in heartbreak.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.687
Whether Queen killed Sara or not...

01:31.880 --> 01:35.771
...he challenged you, he defied you.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.722
For that alone, he must die.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.364
Coordinate your attacks.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.002
If you don't fight in unison,
your numbers become my advantage.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.884
You both have a long way to go.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.564
Particularly you, Oliver.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.725
You've spent years preparing
to bring a bow and arrow to a swordfight.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.766
That's almost funny coming from you. You're
the reason the League is targeting us.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.241
Thea has the club closed for renovations.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.609
I've reinforced all the entrances
with A.R.G.U.S. tech. We're secure.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.401
- John.
- My friends call me Dig.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.610
You shouldn't even speak to me.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.008
If the club is secure as Dig says,
perhaps you and Thea should relocate here.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.164
We discussed that.
Thea wants to stay in the loft.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.767
I have been able to survive
in Starling City...

02:42.920 --> 02:45.685
...because the League has no idea
where in the city I am.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.370
We are not leaving the loft.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.927
You and your sister
have the same stubbornness.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.130
Clearly it comes from
your mother's side of the family.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.724
It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm
taught you in such a short time.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.010
Yeah. He's father of the year.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.641
Your fighting style, it...

03:05.800 --> 03:07.484
It reminds me a bit of Sara.

03:08.200 --> 03:14.321
That's probably because the same people
taught Malcolm and her to fight.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.049
I need to take a shower.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.090
What?

03:27.240 --> 03:30.767
I was gonna ask for a favor,
but I'm really more concerned...

03:30.920 --> 03:33.161
...about you at the moment, Oliver.
I'm fine.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.041
You've been pushing it hard
with Malcolm lately.

03:38.200 --> 03:42.205
- When's the last time you got a decent sleep?
- I will sleep when this is over.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.642
We recovered the Omega
from Chien Naa Wei.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.890
We stole the Alpha from the Hong Kong
military and gave it to Amanda Waller.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.204
Look, no matter how many times you make
me say it, it's not gonna be any less true.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.571
- That's enough. You're relieved.
- Yes, sir.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.451
Sorry. Wailer's a little too thorough
for her own good.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.086
And by "thorough,"
I think you know I mean paranoid.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.641
Well, I've gotten used to it by now.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.526
Where is she, anyway?

04:16.720 --> 04:20.007
Well, the mop-up of the Alpha-Omega
bioweapons problem...

04:20.160 --> 04:22.288
...has become a United States Army
operation.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.410
Ms. Wailer's participation is concluded.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.961
I'm sure that comes
as a profound disappointment.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.810
Oh, like you wouldn't believe.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.762
I apologize for the invasiveness
of your debrief.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.571
And now that it's over, you're free to go.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.566
The Yamashiros have been released too.
They're returning to Japan.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.724
You go with them, and from there
you can return to Starling...

04:43.880 --> 04:46.804
...or go wherever else on earth you wish.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.925
Thank you, General Shrieve.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.128
After what you did, son...

04:53.240 --> 04:54.651
...that's the least I can do.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.848
This is hardcore.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.602
When Dig said he was fortifying the club...

05:12.760 --> 05:15.809
...I figured there'd just be
a few extra locks and cameras. Heh.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.451
- Are you okay?
- No, no.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.921
- Not really.
- What's wrong?

05:24.120 --> 05:27.249
Ollie told me that I can't tell anyone.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.001
Whatever it is, you have to be able
to talk about it with someone.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.447
Someone who's not your brother.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.487
I killed Sara.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.807
- It was Malcolm, he...
- I know.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.802
And none of you told me?

05:47.480 --> 05:50.404
You know last year when I kind of
went off the rails for a bit?

05:50.560 --> 05:53.404
- Yeah.
- I was also under the influence of something.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.690
And just like you, I killed someone.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.807
A cop.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.162
_R0y__
They didn't tell me either.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.490
- And when I found out...
- You wished that you didn't know.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.689
I'm not gonna lie and tell you
that the feeling ever goes away...

06:09.840 --> 06:12.320
...but I can tell you that
it gets easier, Thea.

06:13.920 --> 06:19.211
You don't have to see that cop's family
almost every single day.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.125
I can't imagine
that it's gonna get any easier.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.041
And I don't think that it should.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.450
So he is alive. There were doubts.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.764
Any idea what happens to the stock of Palmer
Technologies when Palmer goes missing...

06:47.920 --> 06:49.649
...for a week?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.885
Whoa.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.964
It's been a week?

06:55.880 --> 06:57.450
I've been a little distracted.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.800
Can't get the modulator
to interface with the system.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.281
- I've been working the problem but...
- Stop.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.201
I imagined you'd say that. This is the step
toward the suit becoming operational.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.529
- A little facial hair is a small price to pay...
- Stop.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.610
This is a subsonic ionizer. If you try to use
it on quad-band circuitry, it could result...

07:15.760 --> 07:20.322
In a catalytic reaction that could destroy
the entire building. Oops.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.729
You need to get some sleep.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.890
- I will once I've cracked the problem.
- Or blow yourself up.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.122
- Whichever comes first.
- Ray.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.807
When those men killed Anna...

07:33.960 --> 07:37.681
...I promised myself I would never
feel that helpless again.

07:38.280 --> 07:42.171
So can you imagine how I felt when Brick's
men took a portion of the city hostage?

07:42.320 --> 07:44.721
Lousy. We all did.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.851
- But if you're punishing yourself...
- I'm not punishing myself.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.162
I'm focused on the task at hand.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.721
Too focused, clearly.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.886
I'm sorry, but I've got
a lot of work to do.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.245
Hey, Dad, it's me again.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.007
Listen, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

08:15.160 --> 08:19.848
...but it's been over a week,
and now that you know the truth...

08:20.000 --> 08:25.211
...neither of us should go through
this alone, so please call me back.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.010
I love you.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.881
Hey. What are you doing here?

08:34.039 --> 08:36.520
I need to talk to you.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.202
- Is everything all right?
- No.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.331
It's about Sara.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.569
Okay.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.969
Malcolm drugged me.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.440
He gave me something...

08:52.600 --> 08:58.403
...that made me susceptible
to suggestion, and l...

08:58.560 --> 09:00.130
Thea...

09:00.800 --> 09:02.211
...what are you talking about?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.483
I killed Sara.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.841
I didn't know what I was doing, okay?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.126
It wasn't me.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.003
I'm so sorry, Laurel.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.522
If Merlyn drugged you...

09:19.040 --> 09:21.247
...then it wasn't your fault.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.731
But how could you work with him?
How could you stand by his side?

09:27.920 --> 09:30.491
Because of the threat of the League.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.804
We have to work with him.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.366
I don't have a choice.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.927
Yes, you do.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.282
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea,
because it wasn't your decision.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.764
If you want to make this right,
what you do from now on...

09:47.600 --> 09:49.170
...that is.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.888
I can't remember Sara's smile.
It's weird, isn't it?

10:08.720 --> 10:14.568
I mean, I know Sara used
to smile and laugh, but...

10:14.720 --> 10:17.405
But when I close my eyes
and I try and picture it...

10:18.120 --> 10:20.407
...all I see is the way that I found her.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.322
Sometimes the only thing
that keeps me going...

10:24.480 --> 10:27.051
...is the thought
of one day finding her killer.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.565
We Will.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.169
I promise.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.087
How do you do that?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.568
- Do what?
- Lie.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.081
Right to my face.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.570
Thea told me, Oliver.
She told me everything.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.007
How could you keep this from me?

10:49.160 --> 10:52.209
After what you wanted to do
to Lacroix and Merlyn...

10:52.360 --> 10:54.522
...do you really need to ask me
that question?

10:54.680 --> 10:59.208
I am not so consumed with vengeance
that I blame Thea for Sara's death.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.481
- I blame Malcolm Merlyn.
- I need him.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.091
He murdered my sister.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.450
With the League targeting us, he is the
only chance I have of saving mine.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.211
This is how it has to be.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.727
It's really amazing.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.844
The way Merlyn always finds a way
under your protection.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.604
I'm sorry, Laurel.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.770
You know, it's hard to remember a time...

11:22.960 --> 11:25.531
...when I was actually in love with you.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.044
I told you not to tell anyone.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.283
I guess I'm just not as good
at keeping secrets as you are.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.804
Thea, I'm not gonna pretend that I understand
all the different types of pain that you're in.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.287
But the threat, it is very real.

11:52.520 --> 11:56.445
And the only way that we are gonna survive
is by acting in unison.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.206
Are you really quoting Malcolm Merlyn
to me right now?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.687
Yes, because he, better than anyone...

12:01.840 --> 12:05.401
...understands the danger
the three of us are facing.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.211
We're not in any danger.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.085
Not anymore.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.083
Not you or me.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.649
But Malcolm?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.322
He's going to face justice.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.449
Thea, what have you done?

12:32.280 --> 12:35.090
You're clearly not League of Assassins.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.042
They wouldn't be this sloppy.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.485
That's right, I forgot. Oliver mentioned
you were having some identity issues.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.371
Though he didn't mention
about your delusions of grandeur.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.205
You killed my sister,
you stupid son of a bitch!

13:09.400 --> 13:11.448
Now you're just embarrassing yourself.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.449
Your sister's teacher was my teacher.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.610
Did you think you could really dispatch me
with a stick?

13:16.760 --> 13:18.444
No.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.443
I suppose we're gonna see
if being a killer runs in the family.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.600
- Step aside, Laurel.
- Nyssa.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.250
This does not concern you.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.884
We've come for Al Sa-her.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.723
You swore to me you didn't kill Sara.
I never believed you.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.922
It is admirable of you to honor
your sister, but you can rest now.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.248
Sara's murder is avenged.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.481
Where is she? Hey!

14:22.680 --> 14:24.284
I told you Merlyn was off-limits.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.171
I know. Then I realized
that I didn't really give a damn.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.004
This is why I keep secrets from you.

14:29.160 --> 14:34.485
Because you let your emotions dictate your
actions, and it is gonna get you killed.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.604
You really think that you had a chance
against Malcolm Merlyn?

14:37.760 --> 14:40.730
- Nyssa and the League kidnapped Merlyn.
- I know.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.803
Thea traded Merlyn for safety.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.362
She was able to contact the League
because they're in town on the hunt.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.605
Merlyn has a video of Thea killing Sara. First
thing he's gonna do is show that to Ra's.

14:50.760 --> 14:55.163
- Then we're right back at square one.
- That was a bluff to make me challenge Ra's.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.122
Merlyn loves Thea.
He would never just serve her up.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.084
We have to get him back.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.210
- What?
- Yeah, I'm with her.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.160
It just sounded like you wanted to rescue
Malcolm Merlyn from the League.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.370
My sister did this because she is angry.
Eventually she will settle down and realize...

15:12.520 --> 15:14.887
...that she basically
just killed her own father.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.969
There's no coming back from that.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.489
The guilt will just eat away at her
until there is nothing left.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.966
Please.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.691
I'll start with the private airfields.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.004
No. Oliver, Merlyn murdered my sister
and corrupted yours...

15:30.160 --> 15:31.650
...and now you wanna save him?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.768
I'm trying to save Thea's soul.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.566
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't need to be here.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.446
I got something.
Unless it's a big fat coincidence...

15:42.600 --> 15:46.366
...that the security cameras
at Starling City Aviation just went dark.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.567
I'll handle it.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.769
I'm going home.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.050
We hope you'll consider
staying with us in Tokyo for a day...

16:02.200 --> 16:05.602
...before you leave for Starling City.
Don't pressure him, Tatsu.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.206
He's been away from home a long time.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.961
You can stay with us forever.
I like playing games with Oliver.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.929
Maybe I can send my family's plane...

16:14.080 --> 16:16.845
...and then you and your parents
can vacation in America.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.604
Your family owns a plane?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.603
It's more of a jet.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.487
I see it, I see it. I see our boat.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.730
I hate boats.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.082
- Oliver.
- What is it?

16:48.200 --> 16:52.967
Hell will be a paradise compared to what
my father has in store for you, Al Sa-her.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.043
Only because of my undertaking.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.126
Your father doesn't care about Sara's
death, just as you know in your heart...

16:59.280 --> 17:05.287
...that your relationship with Sara has cost
you any chance of taking your father's place.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.968
Get him aboard.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.451
I'll deal with this one.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.727
Your sister told us Merlyn killed Sara.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.326
Are you so lost you'd deprive me
of my justice?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.847
This isn't justice, it's vengeance.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.769
Vengeance is justice.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.051
Go!

18:12.080 --> 18:13.366
He's gone.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.966
Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.927
So, what's the play? Trade her for Malcolm?

18:33.080 --> 18:37.642
Ra's will not make that deal,
even for his own daughter.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.089
What are you doing with her?

18:40.240 --> 18:44.689
She's a source of information and leverage.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.921
I need the room.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.050
You're gonna torture her to find out
where Nanda Parbat is?

18:50.200 --> 18:52.123
I need the room.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.807
Everyone clear out.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.808
Oliver, listen, I know what you're doing,
and I know why you're doing it.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.442
But you can't save Thea's soul
at the cost of your own.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.967
Laurel was right.
I need to know where Nanda Parbat is.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.249
Was she also correct you intend
to torture me for that information?

19:32.480 --> 19:35.643
No. Because we know I won't have to.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.482
You placed Sara's killer
under your protection.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.245
Your every action has been aimed
towards the frustration of justice.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.684
I will gladly tell you
where to find my home...

19:48.680 --> 19:50.170
...because you will die there.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.450
- Impossible in here.
- Yeah, that's the idea.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.206
Make it impossible for the League
to get the drop on us.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.283
I thought Thea got us off their hit list.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.330
Yeah, that was before we put
Ra's al Ghul's daughter in a box.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.528
Taking prisoners?
Isn't that crossing a line?

20:07.720 --> 20:11.566
Actually, Oliver has an entire prison
on Lian Yu.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.444
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.682
Nanda Parbat is hidden
beneath the Hindu Kush.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.161
- That was quick.
- She wanted to tell me.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.330
- Thinks I'm gonna die there.
- She's not the only one.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.525
- I understood facing Ra's for Thea, but...
- I am doing it for Thea.

20:26.680 --> 20:30.321
Look, I may not agree with it,
but I understand what you're trying to say.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.208
You don't want Thea to live with the guilt
of getting her father killed.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.687
But how is her brother dying any better?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.122
I don't plan on dying.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.124
That's what you said the last time
you went to go face Ra's.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.203
And how did that turn out for you?

20:44.440 --> 20:48.650
Oliver, I'm about as angry with you right now
than I've been with anyone in my life...

20:48.840 --> 20:52.811
...but that doesn't mean
I want you going on a suicide mission.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.085
You're unusually quiet.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.807
Yeah.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.048
Guys wanna give us a minute?

21:10.400 --> 21:14.564
So Thea served up Merlyn, you wanna
save her from regretting that decision.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.767
Yeah, I get it.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.568
- But?
- But Oliver, there's something more at play.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.165
It's Thea.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.601
- Plain and simple.
- Are you sure?

21:24.840 --> 21:28.208
Right now it's the only thing
I am sure about.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.684
What the hell?

21:39.400 --> 21:42.722
Did you get locked out
of the Palmer Technologies server?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.487
That's a shame.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.761
You did this?

21:45.960 --> 21:52.127
I just came from a friend of mine who has
his head shoved so far up his colon that...

21:52.280 --> 21:54.521
And I'm pretty sure this is true.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.041
He's literally going
to get himself killed.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.891
Him, I can't do anything about.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.929
- You're a different story.
- Great.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.124
Tell me the story while you
unlock the ATOM subroutine directory.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.203
You have two options, Ray.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.964
You can find a way to break the encryption
I used to lock up your server...

22:14.160 --> 22:20.247
...which by my calculations
will take you roughly 6.25 hours.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.485
Or you can use that time
to eat a proper meal, take a shower...

22:27.680 --> 22:29.842
...and get no less than
five hours of sleep...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.721
...at the completion of which
I will give you the password.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.160
I see.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.730
It's your choice,
but I highly recommend option two...

22:38.960 --> 22:42.169
...because this whole situation
has gone from endearingly eccentric...

22:42.320 --> 22:45.290
...to creepily not okay.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.451
If I had the energy
I think I'd be getting angry right now...

22:49.640 --> 22:51.688
...but instead I'll just take option two.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.691
That's a wise choice.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.361
After your dinner and a shower,
I am taking you straight to bed.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.489
Putting you.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.965
Why do I do that?

23:08.160 --> 23:10.447
Yes, yes, yes.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.521
Oh. Shh, Shh.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.848
I didn't hear you come in.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.846
Why can something so small
change the way you view the entire world?

23:22.080 --> 23:24.481
What did Oliver say?

23:26.080 --> 23:27.161
Did you ask him?

23:27.320 --> 23:30.529
- Oliver has other things on his mind.
- Like what?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.209
He's going to Nanda Parbat.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.567
Cheating death once
wasn't enough for him?

23:37.760 --> 23:41.367
Well, he's convinced
he's doing the right thing.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.290
Is he?

23:45.120 --> 23:47.122
You going with him?

23:47.800 --> 23:52.727
Oliver has to do what's right by his
family. I have to do what's right by mine.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.644
That why you didn't go the last time?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.562
Last time Oliver wouldn't let me.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.603
When you thought he died
you blamed yourself.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.087
I don't wanna see you
put yourself through that.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.244
- I can't stop Oliver from going.
- Then go with him.

24:06.720 --> 24:12.284
You might have hung up the uniform,
Johnny, but you're still a soldier.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.041
Standing down while your friend
goes into battle just isn't in your DNA.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.044
Just get there and back in one piece.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.961
About that...

24:23.120 --> 24:25.521
You think I could borrow
the A.R.G.U.S. jet?

24:29.600 --> 24:32.331
What the hell
do you think that you're doing?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.080
Roy told you?

24:34.320 --> 24:35.526
Roy and Laurel.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.848
They both think
that you are out of your mind.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.287
- Me? I know it for sure.
- I'm doing this for you.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.371
If your father dies
because of something you've done...

24:43.560 --> 24:47.007
...a piece of you will go missing
and you'll never be able to get it back.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.322
That I can live with.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.807
But not you dying because of me.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.086
I'm not gonna die.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.329
And the only reason you think
you can live with Malcolm's death...

24:56.520 --> 25:00.161
...is because you don't really know
what it's like to take a life.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.611
You're a good person, Thea.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.287
Both of our parents are dead because of me.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.166
And that guilt,
that's something that I have to live with.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.531
I don't want that for you.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.528
No, please.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.682
Please just don't go.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.401
I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.847
I got a Gulf stream at
Starling City Aviation.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.685
- I can't ask you to come with me.
- You didn't ask me.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.882
Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.

25:55.400 --> 25:59.371
In 1854, I encountered
an illusionist in Vienna...

25:59.560 --> 26:05.647
...and he was dazzling,
magnificent, powerful.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.728
And then, nearly half a century later,
I stumbled upon this man again.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.130
He was withered...

26:14.880 --> 26:16.530
...broken...

26:17.480 --> 26:18.891
...dyifl9-

26:19.800 --> 26:26.809
You see, a magician can cheat many things,
except one.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.562
Please. I was your horseman.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.404
Let me hunt for you once more.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.760
Allow me to prove to you my reborn loyalty.

26:38.960 --> 26:43.409
Al Sa-her, face your death with honor.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.002
Or at least dignity.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.407
Please don't do this.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.971
There is a price you must pay
for your crimes...

26:55.160 --> 26:58.403
...that can only be measured
in agony and blood.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.923
But know I will take no pleasure in this.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.846
Take him away.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.610
No.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.200
No. No. No!

27:32.080 --> 27:34.082
Shut. Up.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.971
Is this an actual Van Go...? Oh!

27:40.440 --> 27:41.771
It's a Vermeer, actually.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.328
I rotate the paintings I have here
with my collection at Starling Museum.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.966
Yeah, I'm really into the Dutch masters
this month.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.764
You're very attractive.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.327
I mean, they're.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.244
- You were right.
- Mm?

27:54.480 --> 27:58.724
Food was delicious, the shower was amazing.
Thank you for insisting on it.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.246
Well, a deal's a deal.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.240
Password's inside.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.688
You know, you didn't have to blackmail me.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.961
I trust your judgment.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.769
In fact, I pretty much depend on it.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.008
Well, that would make you the only one.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.891
I can be as obsessive
and stubborn as the next billionaire.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.168
I know the value
of somebody calling me on it.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.005
Telling me when the emperor
has no clothes.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.207
Speaking of...

28:26.760 --> 28:28.569
Right. Uh...

28:28.760 --> 28:31.809
You know what?
Sometimes I forget that we work together.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.321
When I'm with you, it's just you.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.723
I don't think about work
or the mission or...

28:42.080 --> 28:43.127
I'm sorry.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.690
I'm not.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.646
There it is. Nanda Parbat.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.727
Centuries old.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.601
Never taken by force.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.848
Then why are we doing this, Oliver?

29:07.200 --> 29:09.089
I mean, why are we really doing this?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.327
The League will have sentries
patrolling the area.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.086
If they spot us,
we cannot let them get away.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.328
Surprise is our only advantage.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.605
I'd say they spotted us.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.727
What's your count?

29:27.880 --> 29:30.451
Six on the south side, four on the east.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.045
I don't wanna go out
like Butch and Sundance.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.170
- So, what's the plan?
- Shoot straighter than they do.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.930
Cover me.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.241
Go, go, go!

29:58.480 --> 30:02.087
- If he gets to the fortress, we're dead.
- He won't.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.291
One sniper on the roof.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.127
They're A.R.G.U.S. They work for Waller.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.529
Waller? General Shrieve
said she wasn't involved anymore.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.441
Maybe that decision didn't sit
well with her. We can't stay here.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.169
Delivery truck.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.840
- Sniper will take us out before we get there.
- Pass me your gun. I'll cover you.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.407
Thank me later. Give me your gun.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.930
Go!

30:52.000 --> 30:54.401
I am the prisoner,
yet you look the more tortured.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.324
By now Sa-her
is in the presence of my father.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.807
His last hours will be spent in agony.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.680
Begging for death.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.206
- That doesn't please you?
- I thought it would.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.405
Having Merlyn to hate...

31:13.680 --> 31:16.365
...it's like a piece of Sara
that I can still hold onto.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.969
But once he's gone...

31:21.600 --> 31:23.204
...so is another part of her.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.768
She would want to be avenged.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.602
Can you remember the sound
of Sara's laugh?

31:32.200 --> 31:35.602
When Sara was first brought
before my father...

31:36.520 --> 31:40.081
...the moment he weighed
her apprenticeship or her execution...

31:40.280 --> 31:43.329
...she bore witness
to a demonstration of his power...

31:43.520 --> 31:46.569
...one that inspired terror
in all who had come before.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.125
But Sara laughed.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.287
It was so innocent...

31:54.480 --> 31:55.811
...so genuine.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.843
That was the moment
I fell in love with her, I think.

32:00.480 --> 32:05.361
All I knew, all I craved
was to hear her laugh once more.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.210
Thank you.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.245
Agh!

32:28.840 --> 32:30.604
This place is humongous.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.763
How do we find Merlyn in all of this?

32:34.440 --> 32:37.922
The nanites that I tagged him with
four months ago, this can track them.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.080
Down!

32:44.800 --> 32:46.404
Thanks.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.686
Oh, my God.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.444
Malcolm.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.762
Help me get him down.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.810
Trap.

33:16.720 --> 33:17.801
Mr. Queen.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.361
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.570
Oliver.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.730
Oliver.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.889
- I tried that. Nothing's happening.
- We need to get out of here now.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.128
Save your strength. We're gonna need it.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.365
- I'm not gonna let you die.
- I don't think that's up to you.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.807
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- Not up to you.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.844
You don't understand.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.724
No, I think I do.

33:53.560 --> 33:57.201
You forget I know you.
Sometimes better than you know yourself.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.483
You could have told me I wasn't
doing this for Thea before we left.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.728
You are doing it for Thea.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.126
But, yeah, you're right.
It's not just about her.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.371
You know, every time I close my eyes...

34:16.840 --> 34:19.605
...all that I can see...

34:19.840 --> 34:23.686
...all that I can hear, feel is...

34:25.120 --> 34:26.849
ls the fall.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.487
I couldn't live like that.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.445
I couldn't live knowing that...

34:37.480 --> 34:39.447
...there was someone out there
who beat me.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.045
Yeah, that makes sense.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.810
No, it's egotistical and insane.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.049
So is putting on a mask
and jumping off rooftops, Oliver.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.481
To do that
you have to be in a certain mindset.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.646
Every soldier has to believe
he's coming home...

34:51.880 --> 34:54.565
...otherwise he's paralyzed.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.969
Ra's got in your head.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.169
What was that favor
you wanted to ask me?

35:02.400 --> 35:05.529
- I don't think now is the right time.
- We're not dead yet.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.411
Now might be the only time.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.606
I always assumed if I ever got married
again that Andy would be by my side.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.127
When I lost my brother...

35:20.240 --> 35:22.766
...I never thought I'd get another one.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.610
So pretending for a moment...

35:26.760 --> 35:30.162
...that we aren't two dead men
chained to the floor...

35:31.920 --> 35:34.651
...how do you feel
about being my best man?

35:35.480 --> 35:37.209
I'd feel pretty good about it.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.247
Oliver.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.841
It's time.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.286
- I count at least three shooters.
- Let's move.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.366
Stay down!

36:02.120 --> 36:03.281
Agh!

36:04.760 --> 36:06.967
- Tatsu, come on!
- Dad!

36:10.520 --> 36:12.090
No!

36:12.560 --> 36:14.642
No! Stop, stop!

36:15.520 --> 36:17.887
Go! Get him out of here!

36:31.120 --> 36:34.806
I'm really starting to wonder
why I decided to come with you.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.604
I told you.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.481
I want to show you how I deal
with the things that you're going through.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.891
That's Michelle Vincent.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.003
And her son, Rory. He's 4.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.130
Roy, why are you stalking
some random family?

36:52.320 --> 36:53.401
They're not random.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.002
That's them.
That's the police officer's family.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.889
I give them cash.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.923
Bring them groceries.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.891
I even got Rory a Boba Fett for Christmas.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.409
- Don't worry, they don't know it's me.
- You're torturing yourself.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.046
No, it helps, actually.
It helps me with the guilt.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.689
Look, I appreciate...

37:20.920 --> 37:22.843
...what you're doing here.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.042
Showing me this.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.449
But the cop...

37:27.840 --> 37:29.604
...and Sara...

37:30.720 --> 37:32.324
...they're just not the same thing.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.609
You weren't any more in control
of yourself than I was.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.848
No, not when I...

37:38.040 --> 37:39.485
...killed Sara.

37:39.640 --> 37:43.042
But when I traded Malcolm to the League...

37:44.480 --> 37:46.960
...when I let him into my life...

37:47.120 --> 37:50.169
...I knew exactly who he was.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.609
What he was.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.808
He taught me how to kill.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.924
Maybe I am a killer.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.208
Maybe that's the real me.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.681
Maybe I deserve to be punished.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.206
I don't believe that.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.847
I just tried to have my father murdered.

38:10.960 --> 38:14.089
Can you please just take me home?

39:53.200 --> 39:55.851
I'm in no mood for conversation.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.441
You'll want to hear this.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.965
There's something that I need to tell you.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.445
I can't live without you knowing.

40:08.040 --> 40:11.249
The guilt is far worse
than anything you could do to me.

40:12.720 --> 40:15.041
I lied to you.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.001
And you believed it.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.006
When I told you that Malcolm killed Sara.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.927
He wanted her dead.

40:27.080 --> 40:29.082
He put certain things in motion...

40:29.760 --> 40:31.728
...but I am the one...

40:31.880 --> 40:34.281
...who fired those arrows into her chest.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.325
And when I made the deal...

40:37.480 --> 40:39.289
...to give up Malcolm...

40:39.480 --> 40:41.528
...I promised you your vengeance.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.727
So take it.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.249
You tasted death.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.129
And you wanted more.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.849
But the truth is...

41:01.040 --> 41:02.644
...everyone...

41:02.840 --> 41:04.808
...and everything must come to an end.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.327
Even for one such as me.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.281
Kill me.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.526
But spare John Diggle's life.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.170
Let him go.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.206
I will beg for it.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.448
You have shown tremendous strength...

41:23.640 --> 41:25.244
...fortitude...

41:25.400 --> 41:27.129
...power.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.690
No, Mr. Queen, I don't want to kill you.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.647
I want you to take my place.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.967
I want you to become the next Ra's al Ghul.
