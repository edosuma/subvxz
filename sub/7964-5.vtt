00:12.840 --> 00:14.400
Hello, sir.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.520
And welcome to Saint-Marie.

00:17.080 --> 00:17.960
You're nervous.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.120
-Yeah.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.560
Gosh, no way.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.880
I can't wait to see her.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.680
Aunt Mary was always my most favourite aunt.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.840
How come?

00:24.880 --> 00:26.720
Well, when I was growing up

00:26.760 --> 00:28.280
and my parents had to take my brothers

00:26.760 --> 00:28.280
off to play rugby or cricket

00:28.320 --> 00:29.520
or some ball game or whatever,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.200
they'd always dump me with Aunt Mary.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.480
And what would you do?

00:32.520 --> 00:34.040
Oh gosh, what wouldn't we do, Florence?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.600
But if it was raining, we'd stay inside

00:35.640 --> 00:37.320
and do puzzles from the <i> Puzzler</i>  magazine

00:37.360 --> 00:40.560
or play Battleships or jigsaws, even.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.360
Aunt Mary would always let me do the edges.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.960
And that was good?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.920
Ah, here they come.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.400
Aunt Mary!

01:00.960 --> 01:02.240
Humphrey!

01:02.280 --> 01:05.400
Oh, how handsome you are.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.080
Oh, let me take a good look at you.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.520
You don't look too bad yourself, Aunt Mary.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.040
Oh, you always say the right thing.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.360
Oh, yes, of course, gosh.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.200
Detective Sergeant Florence Cassell.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.200
Florence, this is Aunt Mary.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.240
Welcome to Saint-Marie.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.960
HUMPHREY: So, Aunty, how was England when you left?

01:29.080 --> 01:32.440
Oh, freezing cold and dark as hell.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.000
Feel as if I haven't seen the sun for months.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.360
I can tell you, this is far more like it.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.080
HUMPHREY: Here we are.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.640
Now, I've been planning what we can do tomorrow.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.160
Starting...

01:48.200 --> 01:50.960
...with a boat trip to the coral reef.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Hang on, it's here somewhere.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.600
-Ooh! -Oh.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.400
Hang on, oh, is this...

01:56.440 --> 01:58.680
-Oh, dear! That's not very good.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.680
Humphrey.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.200
I can, uh... If I just...

02:01.240 --> 02:03.240
Ah, it looks like this

02:06.520 --> 02:08.360
Or we can go to the Rum Museum,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.800
which is also less tomato-y in real life

02:08.400 --> 02:11.800
than it is in this photo.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.680
Oh, look, as long as you've got time,

02:12.840 --> 02:16.680
I want to do it all.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.160
Good.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.640
Yeah, can I order room service?

02:24.680 --> 02:27.480
Just a burger and chips and two bottles of beer.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.880
No, thank you.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.520
That's great.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.920
Mmm.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.000
I'm on my way, madam.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.360
If there is anything there, then we will find it.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.960
Now, are you sure it was that room up there?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.800
MARY: Yes, I'm sure.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.000
I know you probably think I'm just a stupid old woman

03:49.040 --> 03:51.760
but I'm sure I heard something.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.760
FREDDIE: Oh, God!

03:53.800 --> 03:55.280
MARY: What?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.320
FREDDIE: You're right.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.360
There is somebody there.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.320
Dwayne, JP, what's going on?

04:41.360 --> 04:43.720
I think he must have fallen from that top balcony, chief.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.000
They say the body's bruised, trauma to

04:43.760 --> 04:47.000
the back of the head,

04:47.040 --> 04:48.480
all consistent with a fall.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.840
What about my aunt

04:50.880 --> 04:52.680
She's fine, sir, I've just been talking to her.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.400
Oh, you have?

04:54.440 --> 04:56.560
Yeah, but you should know, she witnessed

04:54.440 --> 04:56.560
the victim's death

04:56.600 --> 04:59.120
and she's saying it wasn't an accident.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.720
This is murder?

05:01.000 --> 05:01.960
Oh, great.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.120
Right, Dwayne, JP, process the scene

05:04.160 --> 05:06.800
and then get the paramedics to remove the body.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.680
I've got an aunt to interview.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.880
Gosh, well, that's a first.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.080
Oh, thank you, Freddie.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.400
Aunt Mary. Are you okay?

05:18.440 --> 05:20.680
I'm... I'm just a bit rattled.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.200
Freddie here is helping. This is my nephew.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.840
He's a detective inspector.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.880
Freddie Hamilton, hotel porter.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.160
DI Goodman. Thank you for

05:27.920 --> 05:31.160
looking after my aunt.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.600
And now, could I ask you, Mr Hamilton...

05:32.640 --> 05:35.240
Oh, please, everybody calls me Freddie.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.000
Mmm, yes, Freddie, um...

05:37.280 --> 05:39.160
Was the deceased staying at the hotel?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.520
Yes.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.880
Got his check-in details here.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.840
John Green, staying in room 33.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.680
It says he only arrived at the hotel today?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.680
Got a room booked in the name of John Green.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.440
You'll need to know what I saw, won't you?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.160
Yeah, yes of course, if you're up to it.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.640
Oh, yes, of course.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.000
<i></i>

06:01.040 --> 06:04.560
<i>I woke when I</i> <i>heard an altercation</i>

06:01.040 --> 06:04.560
<i>in the next room.</i>

06:05.000 --> 06:08.120
<i>So, then I went downstairs</i> <i>into my sitting room</i>

06:08.800 --> 06:12.320
<i>and that's when</i> <i>I thought I heard</i>

06:08.800 --> 06:12.320
<i>what sounded like a scream,</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:14.800
<i>as the poor man</i> <i>was pushed off his balcony.</i>

06:15.160 --> 06:16.200
Did you see who pushed him?

06:16.240 --> 06:17.800
No, I didn't.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.800
But straight away afterwards I went to his room,

06:21.840 --> 06:23.560
you know, next to mine,

06:23.600 --> 06:26.760
and knocked on the door, but no answer.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.320
So, I phoned down to reception

06:28.360 --> 06:31.680
and Freddie and I found the body together.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.680
-Ten past two.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.560
It had just gone 2:00 when you called me.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.320
Oh, really?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.400
Sorry, then it was 2:00.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.000
Thank you, Aunty.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.120
If you wouldn't mind bearing with us.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.560
Freddie, we just have a couple more questions,

06:49.600 --> 06:51.280
if you would.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.200
Okay, so, when did you know something was wrong?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.400
FREDDIE: <i>It had been a quiet shift,</i>

06:57.640 --> 07:00.400
<i>then the phone rang</i>

07:00.440 --> 07:04.000
<i>and that's when</i> <i>Miss Goodman said</i>

07:00.440 --> 07:04.000
<i>that she'd seen somebody fall.</i>

07:04.440 --> 07:06.920
<i>Then we found</i> <i>the body together.</i>

07:07.520 --> 07:09.680
Did you see anyone leave or enter the hotel

07:09.720 --> 07:12.040
just before or after Mr Green died?

07:12.080 --> 07:13.480
No.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.760
Do you have any CCTV cameras at the hotel at all?

07:15.800 --> 07:19.600
We've got one CCTV camera in reception.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.600
I can get the discs for you.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.200
We'll want all the recordings since lunchtime today,

07:22.240 --> 07:23.480
when Mr Green checked in.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.200
-Of course.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.720
HUMPHREY: Did you interact with

07:25.240 --> 07:27.720
the deceased at all today?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.720
FREDDIE: <i> I brought him</i> <i>a room service dinner</i>

07:29.760 --> 07:31.200
<i>about 8:00 tonight.</i>

07:31.240 --> 07:32.960
<i>He was in good spirits</i>

07:33.000 --> 07:35.760
<i>and he was on his balcony</i> <i>having a drink,</i>

07:33.000 --> 07:35.760
<i>reading a book.</i>

07:35.960 --> 07:40.520
<i>He'd already got a tip</i> <i>ready for me, so I wished</i>

07:35.960 --> 07:40.520
<i>him well and I left.</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:42.480
He didn't seem troubled at all?

07:42.520 --> 07:44.520
Or, I don't know, waiting for something?

07:44.560 --> 07:47.080
No, no. Not that I could see, no.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.520
Right. Do you know

07:48.560 --> 07:49.960
if Mr Green stayed here before?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.440
Not since I've been working here, no.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.640
HUMPHREY: How long is that?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.000
About 14 years.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.040
Right.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.000
So, what do you think, sir?

07:59.040 --> 08:01.320
That we're about to make ourselves very unpopular.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.520
-Mr Green's room here. -Thank you.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.040
Okay, Dwayne, JP, I want you to wake up all

08:03.920 --> 08:07.040
the guests on this floor.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.880
Ask who else saw or heard anything.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.240
Yes, sir.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.000
Okay, Dwayne, how about you start at that end

08:12.040 --> 08:13.240
and I'll start that end

08:13.280 --> 08:16.080
and race each other back to the middle.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.840
Yes, you go to it, tiger.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.200
Okay.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.360
So, no signs of breaking into the victim's room,

08:24.400 --> 08:27.360
we also need to dust the door handle

08:24.400 --> 08:27.360
and the door frame for prints.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.560
Yes.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.960
If you would, Freddie, thank you.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.880
Although, does the hotel record

08:32.920 --> 08:35.160
when the pass keys are used to open

08:32.920 --> 08:35.160
the doors to the rooms?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
Yeah, I can print out the hotel key card logs

08:37.240 --> 08:39.000
as soon as I get the CCTV discs.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.720
Thank you, Freddie.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.840
Right.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.960
Okay.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.120
Let's see what happened here.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.240
How are you getting on, sir?

09:15.080 --> 09:20.640
Uh, yes, well, Freddie just brought me

09:15.080 --> 09:20.640
the CCTV discs and the log

09:20.680 --> 09:23.240
and if we look at room number 33...

09:23.840 --> 09:25.560
Oh, yes, wouldn't you know it?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.960
No key card was used to access the room

09:25.600 --> 09:28.960
after 8:00 p.m. tonight.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.680
So, John Green opened the door to the killer himself.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.880
Mmm.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.760
How about you

09:34.800 --> 09:36.480
Not much, sir.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.280
Although the victim works for a company

09:36.520 --> 09:39.280
based in Colchester

09:39.320 --> 09:41.160
called East Anglian Conservatories.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.720
Okay, Chief, so we've spoken to all the other

09:42.120 --> 09:44.720
guests on the floor

09:44.760 --> 09:48.280
and we couldn't find anyone who heard or saw anything.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.640
They were all asleep.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.720
Although, sir, there was a woman five doors down

09:51.760 --> 09:53.720
who was on the same flight as Mr Green.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.160
<i>She said she had</i> <i>a chat with him and liked him.</i>

09:56.200 --> 09:58.600
<i>He told her that he hadn't had</i> <i>a proper holiday for years</i>

09:58.640 --> 10:00.360
<i>and was looking forward</i> <i>to getting some sun,</i>

10:00.400 --> 10:01.600
<i>seeing some sights.</i>

10:02.080 --> 10:04.440
I don't know, maybe it was a robbery.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.440
FLORENCE: His money is

10:04.480 --> 10:06.440
still in his wallet.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.160
Whatever happened here, it looks like

10:07.280 --> 10:10.160
the victim was asleep,

10:10.200 --> 10:11.840
or at least reading in bed.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.920
And then something made him get up.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.240
Yes, a knock on the door, perhaps, which made John

10:13.960 --> 10:18.240
Green come down here

10:18.280 --> 10:20.080
to let this person in,

10:20.120 --> 10:23.600
and then this person pushed Mr Green

10:20.120 --> 10:23.600
off the balcony to his death.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.480
And then made his or her escape

10:24.520 --> 10:28.480
without, as far as I can tell,

10:28.520 --> 10:30.800
leaving any indication as to who our killer is

10:31.040 --> 10:34.240
or indeed, why John Green had to die.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.640
This is not really adding up to a pile of very much.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.840
Mmm.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.760
Aunt Mary, you all right?

10:51.240 --> 10:52.360
Yeah.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.840
I was just thinking about that poor man.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.680
Yes, yes, I know.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.760
Only, what with the case,

10:58.840 --> 11:00.680
I'm afraid I won't be able to spend much time with you

11:00.720 --> 11:02.600
over the next few days.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.200
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.480
-Of course.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.640
Now, you go and catch whoever did this.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.160
-I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.240
What's that, old chap?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.360
Gosh, well, this is a development

11:43.920 --> 11:46.360
in our relationship,

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
my very own guard lizard.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.320
Ah, who disappears at the first sign of danger.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.640
Ah, Florence.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.000
-Morning, sir. -Morning.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.400
Are you okay?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.440
Yes, couldn't be better.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.240
Although I've been checking

12:02.280 --> 12:05.400
and John Green's got no criminal record

12:02.280 --> 12:05.400
or criminal associates

12:05.760 --> 12:08.080
on the UK Police database or INTERPOL.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.440
Oh, and I've spoken to Immigration as well

12:10.480 --> 12:13.200
and he's never been on Saint-Marie before, either.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.680
-No.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.880
This is his first visit to the island.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.800
Then, how come he was murdered within hours of arriving here?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.800
HUMPHREY: Yes, well, if I hear anything further,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.160
I'll be the first to let you know, of course.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.360
Yes.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.080
All right, thank you. Goodbye.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.040
Mr Green's boss, sir?

12:34.520 --> 12:37.440
Yes, he was rather shocked to hear the news.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.640
What did he have to say about the victim?

12:40.200 --> 12:41.560
Well, um...

12:42.200 --> 12:44.440
It's all rather sad, really, Dwayne.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.840
He said Mr Green was hardworking, honest,

12:46.920 --> 12:49.440
popular with staff and customers alike.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.600
Said he runs the office pub quiz team

12:53.040 --> 12:55.360
and last year he was

12:53.040 --> 12:55.360
a brilliant secret Santa

12:55.400 --> 12:57.000
at the office Christmas party.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.600
So, Florence,

12:58.640 --> 12:59.920
tell me we've got something from the fingerprints

12:59.960 --> 13:01.640
we took from the victim's room?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.880
I'm sorry, but the only fingerprints

13:01.920 --> 13:04.880
I've been able to identify

13:04.920 --> 13:07.560
all belong to the victim. Although, you should know,

13:07.600 --> 13:10.320
the door handle to the room didn't have any

13:07.600 --> 13:10.320
prints on it at all.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.320
It had been completely wiped clean.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.560
Which suggests our killer knew what they were doing.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.480
Dwayne, how are you getting on with the hotel CCTV discs?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.080
Well, Chief, we've got two discs.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.360
One covering yesterday from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.920
and the other one from 2:00 a.m. onwards.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.080
This is the one I started with.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.880
And you can see here,

13:27.920 --> 13:30.080
your Aunt Mary calls down to report the murder.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.640
Freddie goes off to find the body.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.400
And if we keep moving...

13:34.440 --> 13:35.840
It's later...

13:35.880 --> 13:38.200
There, we arrive to inspect the body.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.920
There is no evidence of the killer

13:38.440 --> 13:40.920
making their escape,

13:40.960 --> 13:43.640
but then again, they could have

13:40.960 --> 13:43.640
left by another route.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.360
Good morning, everybody! HUMPHREY: Ah, JP.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.320
-Yes,

13:47.120 --> 13:48.320
I'm quite well, thank you.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.760
Good. Okay, so I've been

13:48.680 --> 13:51.760
back to the hotel,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.200
talking to staff,

13:53.240 --> 13:54.960
and a few people who spoke to Mr Green yesterday

13:55.000 --> 13:56.920
said that he was a really nice guy.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.320
Friendly, typical holidaymaker.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.320
But I do have one lead.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.760
-Yes,

14:00.360 --> 14:02.760
I spoke to a receptionist

14:02.800 --> 14:06.280
and she says she organised a taxi for Mr Green

14:02.800 --> 14:06.280
at about 4:00 p.m.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.760
From the hotel to the botanical gardens.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.160
He was gone for about an hour

14:12.200 --> 14:13.760
and then another taxi brought him back again.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.240
-Well done, JP -Whatever I can

14:13.800 --> 14:16.240
do to help, chief.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.840
And you know what? Maybe that's where John Green

14:17.880 --> 14:19.640
met the person who later killed him.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.520
Yeah, I think we should go and check it out, Florence,

14:21.560 --> 14:23.680
although I'd like to pop in at the hotel on the way.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.840
-I want to see how my aunt is. -Good idea.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.120
Ah, Mr and Mrs Blackburn. How have you

14:26.840 --> 14:31.120
been this past year?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.600
Thank you.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.520
Good morning, Freddie, I wonder,

14:34.640 --> 14:37.520
have you seen my aunt today?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.320
She's at the beachside bar with her friend.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.760
-Miss Lewis.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.920
I'm sorry...

14:42.960 --> 14:45.120
-Hello, Freddie. -Let me help you.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.240
She has a friend?

14:58.640 --> 14:59.960
Aunty.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.800
Sir?

15:02.480 --> 15:05.640
Morning, Inspector, Detective Sergeant.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.640
The Commissioner came to find me,

15:05.720 --> 15:08.640
to check I was okay.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.800
And he's had the most brilliant idea.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.880
Because it's important you focus on the case now,

15:17.640 --> 15:21.760
and that it would be terrible if your aunt's

15:17.640 --> 15:21.760
first day on the island

15:22.120 --> 15:23.880
should tarnish the rest of her stay here.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.160
So, the Commissioner's cleared his diary

15:26.200 --> 15:28.560
and he says he's going to show me the sights himself.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.960
Wow! Wow.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.720
And you're sure you can spare the time, sir?

15:36.920 --> 15:40.480
It's a sacrifice I'm prepared to make.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.320
For the case.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.440
Wonderful.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.120
Can I ask you a question?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.680
Did you see this man here yesterday?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.880
Thank you.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.760
Any progress, sir?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.360
I've spoken to reception

16:01.400 --> 16:03.320
and they don't remember seeing John Green

16:01.400 --> 16:03.320
here yesterday.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
And I can't find anyone who saw him, either.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.120
Although, it is a big place.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.760
And there are hundreds of tourists

16:08.160 --> 16:10.760
here every day.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.640
I mean, what if they just didn't notice him?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.280
Still nothing.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.720
Hey, you got to tell me what's going on.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.280
-You keep smiling to yourself.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.560
There's something up.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.000
Well, uh...

16:33.280 --> 16:35.640
You're right, Dwayne. Um...

16:35.680 --> 16:37.240
But you're not allowed to tell anyone, you know,

16:37.280 --> 16:39.920
because I don't really know how to put this, um...

16:39.960 --> 16:41.480
Wow.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.280
I think...

16:45.960 --> 16:47.080
I'm in love.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.760
You

16:49.800 --> 16:51.920
Yes, it's Rosey.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.280
-Yes, I love her and...

16:54.720 --> 16:56.840
You know, I keep on forgetting that that's how

16:54.720 --> 16:56.840
I feel, you know?

16:57.160 --> 16:59.760
So, I just find myself doing something like...

17:00.160 --> 17:01.840
Like going through the immigration lists

17:01.880 --> 17:05.560
and then I suddenly remember and I just start to smile.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.000
I can't wait to tell her.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.560
You're going to do what?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.880
I'm going to tell Rosey I love her.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.760
Are you crazy?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.160
You can't ever tell a woman you love her.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.600
-No!

17:22.400 --> 17:25.560
Because once you tell a woman that,

17:22.400 --> 17:25.560
they own you.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.920
And the next thing you know,

17:27.960 --> 17:29.520
you'll be telling your friends you can't see them tonight

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
because you fancy "a quiet night in".

17:31.600 --> 17:32.920
So, I...

17:33.400 --> 17:35.760
I don't tell her I love her?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.040
No!

17:38.160 --> 17:39.960
Look, listen, JP.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.800
You want a healthy relationship

17:40.600 --> 17:42.800
with her, right?

17:42.840 --> 17:45.200
Yes, yes, that's exactly what I want, Dwayne.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.200
Then, never tell her the truth.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.560
I think I may be onto something, you know.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.560
Really?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.640
-I said may be.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.320
You see, I started on the other CCTV disc.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.080
You know, the one from the afternoon?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
And there's John Green checking in.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.320
He looks just like any other tourist,

18:16.600 --> 18:19.320
right, Chief?

18:19.360 --> 18:22.280
And here's you, checking in your Aunt Mary

18:19.360 --> 18:22.280
just moments later.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.040
Gosh, does my hair really look like that?

18:24.160 --> 18:28.080
Okay, but if you go forward 10 minutes,

18:24.160 --> 18:28.080
this guy turns up.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.640
-DWAYNE:

18:28.640 --> 18:30.640
His name's Neil Jenkins.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.320
He's a career criminal from the UK who came to

18:30.680 --> 18:34.320
the island nine years ago.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.240
The police back in the UK asked us to

18:34.440 --> 18:37.240
keep an eye on him.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.640
He's done time for ABH, twice.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.920
-You better believe it.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.960
When he came here, I made sure I

18:42.000 --> 18:44.960
introduced myself to him.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.720
Is there any footage of him talking to John Green

18:47.760 --> 18:49.680
-No, Chief.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.960
Or anything else incriminating Mr Jenkins

18:52.000 --> 18:53.960
in Mr Green's murder?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.040
Yes. He's a known criminal

18:56.080 --> 18:59.360
and he was in the same hotel as the victim that afternoon.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.360
That's pretty tenuous, Dwayne.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.640
But if that's all we've got, let's go and pay

19:01.400 --> 19:05.640
Mr Jenkins a visit.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.280
Thanks so much for agreeing to see us.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.000
Always a pleasure to assist

19:10.320 --> 19:14.000
the local constabulary.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.880
How can we help?

19:15.920 --> 19:18.240
Well, it's, uh... It's just that...

19:18.280 --> 19:19.520
Oh, wow!

19:19.600 --> 19:21.200
Um...

19:21.240 --> 19:24.760
It's just that your name came up as part

19:21.240 --> 19:24.760
of our inquiries.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.920
NEIL: Really?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.480
HUMPHREY: Hello.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.040
Would you rather we had this conversation elsewhere?

19:31.160 --> 19:32.400
No.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.040
I haven't got any secrets from me wife.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.760
Ask away.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.240
Okay.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.720
Were you at La Toubana Hotel yesterday?

19:40.760 --> 19:41.840
Yeah.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
Yeah, I'm a member of the gym there.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.840
What time did you arrive and leave?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.240
Got there about half past two, went to the gym, came out,

19:52.280 --> 19:54.440
sat about in the sun for an hour.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.840
Yeah, got home about 4:00.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.600
Does the name John Green mean anything to you?

19:58.640 --> 20:00.480
No, don't think so, Ella?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.240
What's that, sorry?

20:02.480 --> 20:03.880
Do you know a John Green, love?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.880
No. Why?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.360
FLORENCE: This is him.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.520
Please have a good look.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.520
Do you recognise him at all?

20:14.360 --> 20:16.520
No. Never seen him.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.960
Where were you both last night at around 2:00 a.m.?

20:20.120 --> 20:23.040
Well, I was in bed with my wife.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.600
What is all this

20:27.360 --> 20:28.840
No, darling.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.360
I was in bed with my wife, Ella.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.360
She'll alibi me.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.640
Oh, and I should tell you that I'm on sleeping pills.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.680
So, come about midnight, I was out for the count.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.600
-Yeah.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.560
When I went to bed at midnight, Neil had been

20:40.640 --> 20:43.560
asleep for over an hour.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.400
Anyway, what's it matter where we were at 2:00 a.m.?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.600
It's when this man was murdered

20:45.440 --> 20:47.600
at La Toubana hotel.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.160
-No! -All right, love. All right.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.720
And you think because I was in the area

20:50.200 --> 20:53.720
earlier in the day

20:53.760 --> 20:55.880
that that man's death might have

20:53.760 --> 20:55.880
something to do with me?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.080
Eh?

20:57.400 --> 21:00.560
Now, unless you've got any more questions, get out!

21:00.600 --> 21:02.640
Thanks for your help.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.520
HUMPHREY: Is it just a coincidence?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.720
I mean, the man had to be somewhere

21:06.560 --> 21:08.720
on the day of the murder

21:09.040 --> 21:10.680
and both he and his wife say he's got an alibi

21:10.720 --> 21:14.160
for the time John Green was killed.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.280
And I can't find any link to Neil Jenkins

21:16.320 --> 21:17.480
on Mr Green's phone, sir.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.280
That's hardly surprising.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.840
Neil Jenkins hasn't been back to the UK

21:19.320 --> 21:21.840
in the last nine years.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.840
And John Green has never been to Saint-Marie before.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.520
Yeah, so how could the two men possibly have

21:23.880 --> 21:26.520
known each other?

21:26.560 --> 21:27.600
It's a very good point.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.640
Yes, but how about the other Brits

21:29.640 --> 21:31.640
currently on the island?

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
JP, have you been through the list

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
immigration sent over?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.800
I have, and I compared the names on the list

21:36.840 --> 21:38.440
to Mr Green's contacts on his phone

21:38.800 --> 21:41.160
and no one he knows has arrived on the island.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.560
Also, sir, I've gone through Mr Green's emails

21:44.800 --> 21:46.960
and he was just a regular, normal guy.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.520
Oh, gosh. Sorry, I'd better get this.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.200
Aunty!

21:54.560 --> 21:55.960
How are you?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.080
Oh, you're at Catherine's bar?

21:58.440 --> 22:01.040
How very clever of the Commissioner.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.280
Yes, we've actually got to finish up here, anyway.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.840
All right, see you then.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.280
Okay, everyone.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.640
That's all we can do today.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.520
But everything we've learnt about John Green

22:12.560 --> 22:17.760
tells us he was hardworking, honest, a good egg, no less.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.360
A <i> bon oeuf,</i>  Florence.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.480
So, how come within hours of

22:20.840 --> 22:23.480
arriving on holiday,

22:23.520 --> 22:25.440
visiting an island he'd never been to before

22:25.480 --> 22:27.320
and travelling on his own, no less,

22:27.400 --> 22:30.120
someone got into this honest and well-liked man's room

22:30.160 --> 22:32.960
and brutally threw him to his death?

22:34.520 --> 22:37.160
Well, we had a lovely day, didn't we, Selwyn?

22:37.200 --> 22:38.760
Oh, yes.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.320
And it's so nice to hear the old stories

22:38.880 --> 22:42.320
about you, Inspector.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.920
What stories would these be?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.920
Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.

22:46.960 --> 22:47.920
I don't.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.480
Oh, come on, Humphrey. You remember.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.760
I don't.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.760
You were about eight or nine years old.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.880
Back then, Humphrey had quite a little tummy on him.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.680
In fact, he was almost entirely spherical.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.840
Aunty, you are not telling this story.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.680
And we went to the local museum

23:05.040 --> 23:08.600
and they had this old jade that we loved looking at.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.600
And Humphrey was sitting on the wall outside,

23:13.640 --> 23:16.240
only, he fell off it and banged his head,

23:16.280 --> 23:18.600
and that's when he got his family nickname.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.320
-Humpty Dumpty.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.600
<i>Un truc d'anglais.</i>

23:29.120 --> 23:30.920
Are you all right, JP?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.640
Oh, um, yes.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.880
Yes, I'm totally fine.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.160
Thanks for asking.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.560
You look a bit confused.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.280
Well, to be honest with you,

23:46.560 --> 23:48.400
I am a bit confused.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.920
But why

23:53.240 --> 23:56.440
Well, no, it's the opposite, in fact.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.960
Let me put it another way...

23:59.360 --> 24:00.560
Yes.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.640
Yes, it is.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.200
No way, Chief.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.960
Yes, I'm sorry, Dwayne, but it's true.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.960
It is my deepest and darkest secret.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.600
You used to perform magic shows?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.600
You should've seen them.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.880
He'd make a poster, "Humphrey's

24:15.640 --> 24:19.880
Marvellous Magic Show".

24:20.680 --> 24:24.800
And he'd come out in a little bow tie and do all

24:20.680 --> 24:24.800
these wonderful card tricks.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.640
A little bow tie?

24:26.680 --> 24:29.120
Well, yes, I was only 10 years old at the time, sir.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.480
It had to be quite small.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.720
Anyway, it's been a long day.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.080
Um, Humphrey, perhaps you'd escort me

24:34.680 --> 24:38.080
back to the hotel?

24:38.120 --> 24:40.120
Yes, of course, Aunty.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.880
Please.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.120
Thank you for a wonderful day.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.680
The pleasure was all mine, Aunt Mary.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.120
MARY: Thank you.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.600
I'll see you all soon.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.960
-SELWYN: Bye-bye. <i>-Au revoir!</i>

24:54.080 --> 24:57.040
SELWYN: Bye-bye. <i>A plus tard, amour.</i>

24:57.080 --> 24:58.240
Same again, everyone?

24:58.280 --> 25:00.240
I'll give you a hand, Commissioner.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.800
Dwayne, what have you done?

25:02.840 --> 25:05.200
-The advice you gave JP.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.720
And what advice would that be?

25:07.160 --> 25:10.600
That JP must never tell Rosey that he's fallen

25:07.160 --> 25:10.600
in love with her!

25:11.480 --> 25:12.680
What did you do?

25:12.720 --> 25:16.200
It's because...

25:16.240 --> 25:20.280
You know how it is, ladies, when men get too clingy.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.560
It puts you right off.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.200
If he loves her, he has to tell her.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.640
It's you he looks up to.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.640
You need to get him to tell Rosey

25:27.800 --> 25:31.640
how he feels about her.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.800
Ah!

25:42.440 --> 25:45.720
I'm sorry I didn't get to spend

25:42.440 --> 25:45.720
any time with you today.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.080
Oh, don't worry about it, I had a wonderful time.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.680
Yes.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.680
Although there was something I wanted to say

25:53.720 --> 25:57.600
and I thought maybe I'd find

25:53.720 --> 25:57.600
the right time to say it

25:57.640 --> 25:59.760
but maybe there never is a right time.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.880
What is it?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.400
-Humphrey, look! -That's John Green's room.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.600
My God, there's someone in there.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.400
This is the police! Who's there?

27:03.640 --> 27:05.080
-Sir! -Oh, Florence.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.560
Are you all right?

27:06.600 --> 27:09.800
He has a cut to his head and suspected concussion.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.920
They've got to take him in for observation

27:11.960 --> 27:13.600
but he's going to be all right.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.400
Yes, I'm just a bit woozy and a little bit

27:13.680 --> 27:18.400
hurty up there.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.680
What happened?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.320
Someone broke into John Green's hotel room,

27:23.360 --> 27:25.240
they were looking for something.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.240
But Humphrey didn't see who it was

27:25.280 --> 27:28.240
or what they were looking for.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.640
You know, it's got to be our killer, Florence.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.360
Okay, don't worry, sir.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.600
I'll get JP to work the scene and we'll

27:32.400 --> 27:35.600
discover who did this.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.920
Yes, I know you will.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.480
Thank you.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.880
But please, first, would you escort

27:38.520 --> 27:40.880
Mary to her room?

27:41.000 --> 27:44.520
No way, I'm not leaving your side

27:41.000 --> 27:44.520
after what happened.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
No, I'm coming to the hospital with you.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.960
Okay, you can take him now.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.120
I've got some water and some grapes.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.040
Where did you get grapes from?

28:17.080 --> 28:19.840
Ah, a woman has to have her mystery.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.800
Before, you know,

28:22.640 --> 28:24.200
I got tonked,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.200
you were trying to tell me something.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.360
So, your memory's not affected,

28:33.240 --> 28:34.760
unlike mine.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.520
Though some people would say I never had any

28:39.880 --> 28:42.520
in the first place

28:42.560 --> 28:43.840
but, uh,

28:44.160 --> 28:48.600
well, I went to the doctor and he did some tests.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.000
You're not losing your marbles.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.520
Oh, I am, Humphrey.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.360
-I forget things. -We all forget things.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.920
I can't remember what day it is

28:55.200 --> 28:56.920
half the time.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.640
I know, but...

29:00.920 --> 29:03.880
I forget recipes that I've been making my whole life

29:03.920 --> 29:06.360
and the names of friends.

29:08.760 --> 29:12.520
You know, I can't do logic

29:08.760 --> 29:12.520
puzzles any more.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.640
That's what you do. Puzzles.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.280
-That's what we do. -It's scary.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.720
I've had a wonderful life.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.400
And now I'm going to forget it all.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.720
Well, that was my reason for this trip.

29:34.920 --> 29:40.160
I wanted to spend some time with you,

29:34.920 --> 29:40.160
while I can still remember.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.160
And I wanted to be the one who told you.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.560
And now I have.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.640
So, you reckon the Chief will be okay, Sarge?

30:03.680 --> 30:05.520
He should be fine.

30:06.440 --> 30:07.520
Oh, JP.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.280
Did you discover what the intruder

30:07.960 --> 30:10.280
was looking for?

30:10.320 --> 30:11.920
I'm sorry.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.600
I mean, the drawers were open, the victim's

30:12.240 --> 30:14.600
luggage was pulled apart.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.440
I mean, the intruder was definitely

30:14.960 --> 30:17.440
looking for something

30:17.480 --> 30:18.760
but I have no idea what it was

30:18.800 --> 30:20.440
or if he even found it before he ran away.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.200
Then, what about fingerprints?

30:22.240 --> 30:24.440
No new prints on any of the surfaces

30:22.240 --> 30:24.440
I could find.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.400
So, the intruder was wearing gloves.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.560
Almost certainly.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.080
Like he was the first time.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.880
What have you got on your side?

30:30.920 --> 30:33.000
I'm trying to run background checks

30:30.920 --> 30:33.000
on Mr Green's contacts

30:33.040 --> 30:34.440
but I'm struggling. He only knows about 30 people

30:35.960 --> 30:38.720
and they're all from his hometown, Colchester.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.520
It's just not much to go on.

30:40.560 --> 30:43.640
It's just like his credit report, Sarge,

30:40.560 --> 30:43.640
it's all above-board.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.840
But where it lists previous residences,

30:45.880 --> 30:49.320
it's only got his Colchester address, which he moved

30:45.880 --> 30:49.320
into five years ago.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.960
There are no other addresses listed before then.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.040
But he must have lived somewhere before then.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.560
You know what?

30:56.600 --> 30:59.960
I think his passport was only issued

30:56.600 --> 30:59.960
five years ago.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.120
Yeah, it was.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.840
Okay, everyone,

31:07.880 --> 31:11.080
I think we need to find out what John Green was up to

31:07.880 --> 31:11.080
before five years ago.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.960
-Chicken soup.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.160
Everyone needs chicken soup when they're ill.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.440
Yes, quite.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.600
-Oh, well, it's...

31:38.360 --> 31:39.400
It's delicious.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.680
Now, no over-exciting him.

31:45.720 --> 31:49.760
I've spoken to the doctor and he needs complete bed rest

31:49.800 --> 31:51.520
for at least another day.

31:51.560 --> 31:52.760
Okay?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.800
-Of course. -Yes.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.440
Nuts to that, you've made a breakthrough,

32:04.960 --> 32:07.440
haven't you?

32:07.480 --> 32:09.000
Yes, what she said.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.640
Well, sir, we finally realised

32:11.680 --> 32:13.680
we didn't have a single record for John Green

32:13.720 --> 32:15.080
from more than five years ago.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.160
It was like he didn't exist before 2011.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.080
That's when Sarge came up with her genius idea.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.760
What if he didn't exist before 2011?

32:23.920 --> 32:25.480
Oh, that's not possible.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.000
It's not his real identity, is it?

32:27.240 --> 32:29.240
I got onto the police back in Essex

32:29.280 --> 32:31.880
but at the right level this time,

32:29.280 --> 32:31.880
the Superintendent.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.360
And she was able to confirm my suspicions

32:34.400 --> 32:36.120
and put me onto John Green's handler.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.320
John Green is not his real name, Chief,

32:36.200 --> 32:39.320
it's Marcus Knight.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.360
He was a crooked accountant who worked with a number

32:39.360 --> 32:42.360
of criminal families

32:42.400 --> 32:44.960
and a load of diamond merchants

32:42.400 --> 32:44.960
from the East End of London.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.680
Oh, this is wonderful!

32:46.720 --> 32:49.160
But six years ago, he knew the police

32:46.720 --> 32:49.160
were closing in on him,

32:49.200 --> 32:50.800
so he turned his files over to them

32:50.840 --> 32:53.200
in return for a reduced sentence

32:50.840 --> 32:53.200
and a new identity.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.080
Yes, his evidence put seven other

32:53.240 --> 32:56.080
criminals in prison.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.280
Although the police still suspected

32:56.120 --> 32:58.280
Mr Knight had stolen

32:58.320 --> 33:00.600
the best part of a quarter of a million pounds

32:58.320 --> 33:00.600
from his clients

33:00.640 --> 33:02.400
before he went to the police.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.320
Not that they were able to prove it

33:02.440 --> 33:04.320
or recover the money.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.520
DWAYNE: But once he'd served his time for false accounting,

33:06.560 --> 33:09.840
the government gave Mr Knight a new name and put him

33:06.560 --> 33:09.840
in Witness Protection.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.400
Brilliant, brilliant! Well done, everyone.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.200
We've already been onto Immigration, Chief,

33:13.240 --> 33:16.200
and they say Marcus Knight visited

33:13.240 --> 33:16.200
the island six years ago.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.800
Just before he turned himself in to the UK police.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.000
He's been to the island before?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.160
HUMPHREY: In which case,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.360
Florence, you need to compile a list of all Marcus Knight's

33:23.200 --> 33:25.360
known associates

33:25.400 --> 33:27.240
before he went to prison.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.840
Starting with those criminals he turned Queen's

33:27.280 --> 33:29.840
evidence against.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.000
Yes, sir.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.920
Yes, well done. Well done, everyone.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.680
Perhaps I'd better rest.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.680
HUMPHREY: Don't worry, Aunt Mary.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.680
Just a moment.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.600
Ah, hello, hello. Sorry, don't know

34:00.720 --> 34:03.600
how that happened.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.560
But now I've got you here, I wonder if you could help me?

34:06.600 --> 34:09.080
Because we're going to need a large whiteboard

34:09.120 --> 34:11.200
and some marker pens of varying colours.

34:11.240 --> 34:12.600
Thank you.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.240
I mean, after all, Aunty,

34:16.400 --> 34:18.840
what else do we do when we're confined indoors

34:18.880 --> 34:21.040
if not solve some puzzles?

34:25.200 --> 34:27.040
You know what I can't help thinking, Aunty?

34:27.440 --> 34:30.240
That Marcus Knight is the Cretan from the riddle.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.480
Who?

34:32.520 --> 34:34.920
The man from Crete who says that all men from

34:32.520 --> 34:34.920
Crete are liars.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.240
-I don't know that one. -Yes, you do.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.000
The Epimenides paradox, you taught it to me.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.960
You know, if he's from Crete,

34:40.920 --> 34:42.960
he's lying,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.760
and if he's telling the truth, then he can't be from Crete.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.320
I can't remember it.

34:50.360 --> 34:53.360
Sorry, I told you, it's not what it was.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.840
Don't worry.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.800
All I'm saying is that

34:57.840 --> 35:00.600
nothing we know about Marcus Knight

34:57.840 --> 35:00.600
can be presumed to be true.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.200
So what I keep coming back to is

35:03.600 --> 35:06.960
what if he never actually went to the botanical

35:03.600 --> 35:06.960
gardens at all?

35:07.600 --> 35:08.720
I see.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.760
Well, where do you think he went?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.160
No idea.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.480
Hmm.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.880
Although Dwayne said Marcus Knight stole a quarter

35:17.520 --> 35:20.880
of a million pounds

35:20.920 --> 35:23.440
before he went to prison six years ago.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.960
Yes and Dwayne also said that Marcus came

35:23.480 --> 35:25.960
out to the island

35:26.000 --> 35:27.440
six years ago, as well.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.040
Shortly before he turned himself

35:27.480 --> 35:29.040
in to the police.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.000
So, maybe he's been hiding his money on the island

35:32.040 --> 35:33.160
all this time.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.920
Good grief, Aunty, I wonder if you're right?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.160
So, if he didn't go to the botanical gardens,

35:38.200 --> 35:39.360
I wonder where he did go?

35:39.480 --> 35:41.840
Well, where else is there nearby?

35:42.160 --> 35:45.800
Somewhere he could have kept a quarter of

35:42.160 --> 35:45.800
a million pounds safe

35:45.840 --> 35:46.920
for six years.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.360
Well, gosh, I don't really know.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.840
I mean, there's just a few shops up there,

35:49.880 --> 35:53.560
there's a chemists and a laundry, I think.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.960
And then there's just a...

35:56.920 --> 35:59.600
Good grief! There's also a bank.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.720
<i>Do you want to ring Florence</i> <i>or shall I?</i>

36:02.560 --> 36:04.480
MONIQUE: I can confirm that Marcus Knight

36:04.520 --> 36:06.760
took out a safety deposit box with us

36:06.840 --> 36:08.640
in February of 2010.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.560
-Yes.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.400
And three days ago, he presented himself

36:10.600 --> 36:13.400
and his key to the branch,

36:13.440 --> 36:16.480
emptied his box, closed down the account

36:13.440 --> 36:16.480
and handed back his key.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.520
Do you know what he'd been keeping here in

36:16.680 --> 36:19.520
those six years?

36:19.560 --> 36:20.920
MONIQUE: <i> I don't.</i>

36:20.960 --> 36:23.600
<i>But I know it fitted</i> <i>inside a brown hold-all.</i>

36:25.240 --> 36:27.320
But we never found no brown hold-all in his room.

36:29.560 --> 36:33.520
Okay, so the killer took the bag of money

36:29.560 --> 36:33.520
when he killed Marcus Knight.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.560
Yes, because it was full of a quarter of a million pounds.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.040
And just imagine, Sarge,

36:38.080 --> 36:40.080
the money's been sitting in that bank all this time.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.600
All you'd need is a key and all of the cash is yours.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.800
Where was the key all this time?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.200
How do you mean?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.680
Okay, imagine. You're Marcus Knight.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.400
You've put a load of money in a safety deposit box

36:54.440 --> 36:56.440
and you know you're going to prison.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.920
What are you going to do with the key?

36:58.320 --> 37:01.080
-Give it to someone for safekeeping.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.520
Okay, Dwayne, go back to the bank

37:03.560 --> 37:06.920
and get the key Mr Knight used to open his

37:03.560 --> 37:06.920
safety deposit box.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.280
I think we need to test it for fingerprints.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.560
DWAYNE: Find anything yet, JP?

37:17.680 --> 37:20.600
JP: Seven points of comparison,

37:17.680 --> 37:20.600
that's admissible in court.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.440
Who does the fingerprint belong to?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.240
Neil Jenkins. I don't know what

37:26.200 --> 37:27.840
you're talking about.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.440
FLORENCE: Marcus Knight is the real

37:27.880 --> 37:30.440
name of John Green,

37:30.480 --> 37:34.160
the man who was murdered only hours after you were

37:30.480 --> 37:34.160
seen at his hotel.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.400
The man you told us you didn't know.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.800
Even though he visited you six years ago.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.680
Which is when he left his safety

37:38.840 --> 37:41.680
deposit key with you,

37:41.720 --> 37:43.080
didn't he?

37:43.400 --> 37:46.720
DWAYNE: A safety deposit key we just

37:43.400 --> 37:46.720
retrieved from the bank

37:46.800 --> 37:48.800
and we were able to lift a clean fingerprint

37:48.840 --> 37:50.640
belonging to you off the key fob.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.360
Which implicates you in his murder.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.840
Unless you can explain how your

37:53.400 --> 37:56.840
fingerprint got there.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.280
All right.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.440
All right, I admit

38:01.120 --> 38:04.520
that I knew that John was really Marcus.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.360
Yeah.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.400
He used to be my company accountant,

38:06.480 --> 38:08.400
years ago.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.720
DWAYNE: So, why did you lie to us?

38:10.920 --> 38:12.560
Because I wanted to protect his secret.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.120
Which was?

38:14.280 --> 38:17.640
Look, before Marcus handed himself over to the old bill,

38:18.280 --> 38:20.720
he siphoned off a lot of cash for himself

38:20.920 --> 38:23.720
and he was going to store it in the bank

38:20.920 --> 38:23.720
for when he came out.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.920
Now, he asked me to look after the key.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.560
<i>The day that he came back,</i> <i>we arranged a meeting.</i>

38:30.600 --> 38:32.240
<i>We went to the hotel,</i> <i>sat out on the balcony,</i>

38:32.280 --> 38:34.040
<i>had a few beers,</i> <i>talked about old times,</i>

38:34.080 --> 38:36.640
<i>you know, compared war wounds,</i> <i>it was lovely.</i>

38:36.680 --> 38:40.520
<i>And then, I gave him the key</i> <i>so that he could</i>

38:36.680 --> 38:40.520
<i>go to the bank.</i>

38:41.040 --> 38:43.400
And you got on, after all this time?

38:43.440 --> 38:44.720
Yeah, of course we got on.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.560
I mean, everyone loved Marcus, didn't they?

38:47.160 --> 38:48.760
I mean, I actually said to him that he ought to cancel

38:49.320 --> 38:50.920
his reservation at the hotel

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
and he should spend the rest of his

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
holidays with us.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.800
I said that he could spend the rest of

38:55.360 --> 38:58.800
the holidays with us.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.120
Yes.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.560
And he would've done if he hadn't died,

39:00.440 --> 39:02.560
the poor man.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.520
So, you knew Marcus Knight as well?

39:04.560 --> 39:07.160
He was Neil's accountant, so I suppose I knew

39:04.560 --> 39:07.160
him to say hello to.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.080
And you both admit you knew about the money

39:09.120 --> 39:12.080
Mr Knight had been keeping at the bank all this time?

39:12.120 --> 39:13.320
I didn't know about any money.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.320
Look, all right, all right, that's true.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.040
Ella didn't know about the money.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.920
It wasn't my secret to share, simple as that.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.560
Even though last time I was here,

39:20.600 --> 39:23.280
you told me you had no secrets from your wife.

39:23.840 --> 39:27.600
You see, this is the problem we've got, Mr Jenkins.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.680
We know you couldn't have got Mr Knight's

39:28.080 --> 39:30.680
money out of the bank

39:30.720 --> 39:32.200
while he was in prison

39:32.400 --> 39:35.120
because Mr Knight was the only one who

39:32.400 --> 39:35.120
could get it out.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.960
So, this is what we're thinking.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.120
Once you were sure Mr Knight had his money,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.680
you went to his room in the middle of the night,

39:42.720 --> 39:45.240
killed him and stole it for yourself.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.320
Listen.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.440
You're forgetting one thing, all right?

39:54.280 --> 39:57.800
I had an alibi for the night that he was murdered.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.240
So, where were you last night, just before midnight?

40:00.280 --> 40:01.600
I was asleep, why?

40:01.840 --> 40:02.920
Can you prove that?

40:03.120 --> 40:04.600
I've done nothing wrong here, all right?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.000
All I did was look after a key for an old friend.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.680
So unless you have got a warrant,

40:07.040 --> 40:09.680
or you're going to charge me,

40:09.720 --> 40:12.600
then I have finished helping the police

40:09.720 --> 40:12.600
with their inquiries.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.920
So, out!

40:20.000 --> 40:22.960
I'm telling you, Neil Jenkins is our killer.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.520
He's a known criminal,

40:24.560 --> 40:25.960
he's been looking after the key

40:26.000 --> 40:27.760
and he knows the bag contained money.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.440
But Dwayne, he's already a rich man.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.680
Why would he need to kill for money?

40:33.440 --> 40:35.280
We need the Inspector.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.320
If Neil Jenkins killed Marcus,

40:38.360 --> 40:41.400
he'll have taken the bag of money

40:38.360 --> 40:41.400
and hidden the cash somewhere.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.600
So, JP, how's your research going?

40:43.640 --> 40:46.960
Well, we already know a lot about Neil Jenkins.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.920
So, I have decided to do a few background checks on his wife.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.960
And I've discovered she was on the police computer

40:53.320 --> 40:56.000
under her maiden name, Ella Thomas.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.760
Fifteen years ago,

40:57.800 --> 41:00.240
about a year or so before she married Neil,

41:00.280 --> 41:02.800
she was cautioned for running a fake perfume stall

41:02.840 --> 41:04.880
in London, on Oxford Street.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.040
She also has a serious amount of debts on her credit cards.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.520
Oh, so she's not as innocent as she pretends to be.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.160
But how did she know that Marcus was collecting

41:11.600 --> 41:14.160
the money that day?

41:14.200 --> 41:15.840
Hmm?

41:15.880 --> 41:17.880
Her husband said he never told Ella

41:15.880 --> 41:17.880
about the bag of money.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.760
You know what?

41:20.120 --> 41:24.080
We still don't know why the killer returned

41:20.120 --> 41:24.080
to the scene of the crime.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.600
I think we should find out, don't you?

41:26.960 --> 41:28.240
No, sir, sir.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.880
The doctors said you had to stay in bed.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.640
Yes, I know, but what do doctors know?

41:32.800 --> 41:34.000
Oh... Hold on.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.000
Don't worry, I'm fine.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.800
And I hope you don't mind, but for the remainder

41:39.200 --> 41:41.800
of the case,

41:41.840 --> 41:44.960
I am co-opting the help of a civilian expert.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.320
Aunt Mary.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.360
So, the killer gets back in here.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.240
But what are they looking for?

41:55.040 --> 41:56.560
And did they find it?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.000
Well, most certainly not, sir.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.040
Seeing as you interrupted them.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.720
Yes, but it was down here

42:01.760 --> 42:04.120
that the original fight for the money

42:01.760 --> 42:04.120
must have been.

42:04.320 --> 42:09.680
Because Mr Knight was thrown over this balcony, here.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.200
Sir, it has to be Neil Jenkins.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.160
He's the only person on the whole island

42:14.200 --> 42:16.120
who knew there was a bag full of money.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.800
Well, yes, we keep saying that but, you know,

42:16.160 --> 42:18.800
I wonder if that's true?

42:18.840 --> 42:20.840
How do you mean?

42:20.880 --> 42:23.040
Well, this whole case has been the wrong way round

42:20.880 --> 42:23.040
from the start, hasn't it?

42:23.080 --> 42:26.160
I mean, John Green wasn't even John Green.

42:27.960 --> 42:32.400
So, what if the one proven crook in this case

42:33.240 --> 42:36.960
isn't the crook after all?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.920
I mean, Neil's already rich, so why would he

42:37.000 --> 42:40.920
need to kill for money?

42:40.960 --> 42:43.880
And yes, in fact, what if the secret

42:40.960 --> 42:43.880
of the money

42:44.160 --> 42:47.920
wasn't even a secret?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.680
Singing...

42:59.880 --> 43:01.360
Well, I'll be blowed.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.800
NEIL: <i> We went to the hotel,</i> <i>sat out on the balcony,</i>

43:02.840 --> 43:04.840
<i>had a few beers,</i> <i>talked about old times.</i>

43:04.880 --> 43:07.840
I said, "Look, why don't you cancel your reservation

43:04.880 --> 43:07.840
at the hotel, all right?

43:07.880 --> 43:09.920
"And come spend the rest of your holidays with us?"

43:09.960 --> 43:12.680
-Ten past two.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.280
That's why you'd kill that night.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.880
And why the secret's not a secret.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.200
But wait, that's not possible.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.640
Good grief.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.600
You know who killed Marcus Knight?

43:38.760 --> 43:39.840
Aunt Mary.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.880
-That's right.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.080
Then, I need the log of who opened

43:42.920 --> 43:46.080
what doors that afternoon.

43:46.120 --> 43:49.360
I need to know who was in room 32.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.880
Mr and Mrs Jenkins.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.960
Why do want to meet us up here?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.480
Well, you want to know who killed your good friend

43:56.520 --> 43:58.760
Marcus Knight, don't you?

44:00.520 --> 44:01.760
Of course.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.360
Please.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.520
Now, Neil.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.360
You and Marcus went to his room the afternoon

44:06.080 --> 44:09.360
he was killed, didn't you?

44:09.400 --> 44:10.840
What of it?

44:11.280 --> 44:13.600
Freddie, if you would, please?

44:15.480 --> 44:17.920
That's not Marcus's room, it was that one over there.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.320
Don't worry, all will become clear.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.680
Please.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.480
You see, all along, you had to be

44:24.520 --> 44:27.480
our killer, Neil.

44:27.520 --> 44:30.120
Only you knew about Marcus's bag of money.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.520
And yet,

44:31.960 --> 44:34.400
Marcus was your one-time company secretary.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.280
You'd even looked after the key to his

44:34.440 --> 44:37.280
safe deposit box

44:37.320 --> 44:38.840
for the last six years.

44:39.360 --> 44:43.560
This is not the behaviour of someone

44:39.360 --> 44:43.560
who has hate in his heart.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.880
-You didn't kill him. -Too damn right I didn't.

44:48.920 --> 44:51.040
But it made me realise... Excuse me, Aunt Mary.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.960
...that there was someone else on the island

44:54.480 --> 44:56.200
who could have known about that money.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.240
And that was you, Ella.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.720
Because even if you didn't tell your wife

44:59.760 --> 45:02.040
about the bag of money, well...

45:02.080 --> 45:03.920
I mean, Ella was still here six years ago

45:03.960 --> 45:06.240
when Marcus dropped that money off.

45:06.600 --> 45:07.960
He could have told her all about it then.

45:08.360 --> 45:11.520
You already have a criminal past,

45:08.360 --> 45:11.520
selling fake perfume.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.120
And you're maxed out on your credit cards.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.320
You need the money.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.240
It's not that bad.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.240
I didn't kill him!

45:20.400 --> 45:22.640
No.

45:22.680 --> 45:25.040
Because that honour belongs to you, Freddie.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.480
What?

45:26.520 --> 45:28.560
You killed Marcus Knight.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.320
What? I don't understand,

45:29.200 --> 45:31.320
why would I do that?

45:31.400 --> 45:33.320
HUMPHREY: I know. I mean...

45:33.960 --> 45:38.360
How did you even know there was a bag of cash

45:33.960 --> 45:38.360
to steal in the first place?

45:38.400 --> 45:39.520
Well, let's see.

45:39.560 --> 45:40.960
Because as a porter,

45:41.720 --> 45:43.560
you have one particular skill, don't you?

45:43.600 --> 45:46.560
<i>And that is</i> <i>remembering names and faces.</i>

45:46.640 --> 45:50.280
Ah, Mrs and Mrs Blackburn, how have you

45:46.640 --> 45:50.280
been this past year?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.680
So, I think your suspicions were raised

45:55.720 --> 45:59.640
the moment Mr Knight returned to the hotel

45:55.720 --> 45:59.640
after a gap of six years,

45:59.680 --> 46:01.000
saying his name was now Mr Green.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.960
Afternoon, I've got a room booked

46:01.440 --> 46:04.960
in the name of John Green.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.120
FLORENCE: <i>When a well-known island crook</i>

46:05.200 --> 46:08.120
<i>arrived soon after,</i>

46:08.160 --> 46:11.680
<i>we think you decided</i> <i>to find out what was going on.</i>

46:13.440 --> 46:15.640
Because although you never used your pass key

46:15.680 --> 46:19.120
to enter Marcus's room that night, I mean,

46:15.680 --> 46:19.120
you'd never be so stupid,

46:19.840 --> 46:23.440
the hotel records do show that you were in this room

46:23.480 --> 46:25.640
for 25 minutes that afternoon.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.720
<i>The room next</i> <i>door to Mr Knight's.</i>

46:29.760 --> 46:31.920
Even though there were no guests staying here.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.800
So, why is that, Freddie?

46:34.160 --> 46:36.640
FLORENCE: <i>It was when you heard</i>

46:34.160 --> 46:36.640
<i>the story of a bag of cash</i>

46:36.680 --> 46:39.480
<i>containing a quarter</i> <i>of a million pounds.</i>

46:39.880 --> 46:42.000
You know what the tragedy is?

46:42.840 --> 46:44.880
Marcus would possibly be still alive

46:44.920 --> 46:48.320
if you hadn't invited him to move into your house

46:44.920 --> 46:48.320
for the rest of the holiday.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.480
FLORENCE: <i> Because</i> <i>it made Freddie realise</i>

46:50.520 --> 46:53.240
<i>if he wanted his bag of money</i> <i>for himself,</i>

46:53.280 --> 46:55.360
<i>he'd have to act fast.</i>

46:55.600 --> 46:58.560
HUMPHREY: <i> When you</i> <i>got to deliver room service</i>

46:55.600 --> 46:58.560
<i>to Marcus that night...</i>

46:58.600 --> 47:02.000
<i>I mean, I think you checked</i> <i>for the bag of money,</i>

46:58.600 --> 47:02.000
<i>of course you did.</i>

47:02.040 --> 47:04.360
<i>But you also made sure</i> <i>that you left</i>

47:02.040 --> 47:04.360
<i>the door on the latch</i>

47:04.400 --> 47:06.640
<i>so you wouldn't need to use</i> <i>your pass key</i>

47:04.400 --> 47:06.640
<i>later on, didn't you?</i>

47:07.400 --> 47:11.320
As you knew the hotel logged every time a key is used.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.480
I was downstairs, on reception,

47:11.520 --> 47:14.480
when he was killed.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.400
Oh, yeah, that's right. You were, weren't you?

47:17.120 --> 47:20.680
The CCTV footage proves it.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.720
-Yes, Chief.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.440
Because you're right, Freddie.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.760
Here you are, just after 2:00 a.m.,

47:28.600 --> 47:32.760
minding your own business.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.920
And here's the phone call from Aunt Mary,

47:35.960 --> 47:37.440
phoning down to reception,

47:37.480 --> 47:39.320
telling you that someone's fallen from their balcony.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.600
And there you are, getting your torch

47:39.360 --> 47:42.600
and going to help.

47:42.640 --> 47:46.120
So, how on earth could you possibly be the killer?

47:46.160 --> 47:48.080
I mean, you never left reception.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.280
But then I remembered.

47:53.360 --> 47:54.720
When we first interviewed you,

47:54.920 --> 47:58.920
Aunt Mary said she phoned down to reception at 2:10 a.m.

47:59.840 --> 48:02.600
But you corrected her and said it was

47:59.840 --> 48:02.600
more like 2:00.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.600
It had just gone 2:00 when you called me.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.760
It's only a difference of 10 minutes,

48:04.640 --> 48:07.760
what would it matter?

48:08.160 --> 48:12.360
Well, as it happens, quite a lot.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.840
So, thank you, Mary. You weren't

48:12.400 --> 48:15.840
confused that night

48:16.760 --> 48:18.760
or forgetful in any way.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.240
It was ten past two when you rang down.

48:21.360 --> 48:25.280
And it was in this missing 10 minutes

48:21.360 --> 48:25.280
that Freddie committed murder.

48:25.560 --> 48:29.600
HUMPHREY: <i> First he waited</i> <i>until he had to swap</i>

48:25.560 --> 48:29.600
<i>the CCTV discs over</i>

48:29.640 --> 48:31.200
<i>at 2:00 a.m., as we know.</i>

48:31.600 --> 48:33.080
Well, chief, we've got two discs,

48:33.120 --> 48:35.760
one covering from 2:00 p.m. yesterday to 2:00 a.m.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.320
and the other one from 2:00 a.m. onwards.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.080
HUMPHREY: <i>But he didn't put</i>

48:37.400 --> 48:39.080
<i>in the new disc,</i>

48:39.120 --> 48:41.120
<i>not yet, anyway.</i>

48:41.160 --> 48:43.400
<i>See, at this stage,</i> <i>he was just planning to carry</i>

48:41.160 --> 48:43.400
<i>out a quick robbery,</i>

48:43.440 --> 48:46.160
<i>get back to reception</i> <i>and then put the new disc in,</i>

48:46.200 --> 48:49.720
<i>before anyone</i> <i>noticed his absence,</i>

48:46.200 --> 48:49.720
<i>which is what he did.</i>

48:49.760 --> 48:51.080
<i>Go into Marcus's room,</i>

48:51.120 --> 48:52.840
<i>letting himself in</i> <i>without using his key.</i>

48:53.440 --> 48:54.960
And then...

48:56.080 --> 48:57.840
Well, we can't know for sure.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.240
But we do know Marcus woke up.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.520
<i>Did he threaten</i> <i>to call the police, Freddie?</i>

49:08.280 --> 49:11.360
<i>Or were you always prepared</i> <i>to kill for that money?</i>

49:11.400 --> 49:13.440
<i>We knew, the way you knew,</i> <i>you couldn't back down.</i>

49:13.480 --> 49:16.080
<i>You had to get that</i> <i>money at all costs.</i>

49:23.440 --> 49:24.760
And when you got back down to reception,

49:24.800 --> 49:27.680
I imagine you were just in a desperate panic.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.960
Wishing you could have your time over again.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.720
That's when you realised

49:32.360 --> 49:35.600
the disc wasn't recording.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.480
<i>You could have</i> <i>your time over again.</i>

49:37.520 --> 49:41.200
<i>All you needed to do was</i> <i>set the wall clock</i>

49:37.520 --> 49:41.200
<i>back to 2:00 a.m.</i>

49:41.240 --> 49:43.240
<i>before starting the next DVD.</i>

49:43.480 --> 49:46.480
So that when Aunt Mary rang down a few minutes later

49:46.520 --> 49:48.000
to report the murder,

49:48.040 --> 49:49.960
you now appeared to have an alibi

49:50.000 --> 49:52.760
for the moments leading up to the murder.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.280
It was like you never left reception.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.520
Except, when you look closely,

49:57.560 --> 50:00.840
you could see the brown holdall

49:57.560 --> 50:00.840
at your feet.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.120
All you then needed to do

50:03.160 --> 50:05.720
was return the wall clock to the real time later on,

50:05.760 --> 50:08.120
after you'd taken the disc out to give to us.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.200
<i>I mean, it was only ever</i> <i>a few minutes out, anyway.</i>

50:10.520 --> 50:12.760
I know.

50:14.400 --> 50:16.480
I mean, after all, Freddie's got no

50:14.400 --> 50:16.480
criminal record.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.760
There's been no hint he's stolen

50:16.520 --> 50:18.760
from guests before.

50:18.920 --> 50:23.720
But then, I imagine no one's brought in

50:18.920 --> 50:23.720
£250,000 in hard cash before.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.680
So, why?

50:27.720 --> 50:30.120
I mean, in a world where you get by

50:27.720 --> 50:30.120
on dollar tips here and there,

50:31.080 --> 50:33.600
I imagine that amount of money was a just a bit

50:31.080 --> 50:33.600
too hard to resist,

50:33.640 --> 50:35.040
eh, Freddie?

50:35.080 --> 50:37.240
I mean, plus it's stolen. So, if someone took it,

50:37.280 --> 50:40.080
Marcus would never be able to report his

50:37.280 --> 50:40.080
theft to the police.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.840
Easy money, really.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.920
I imagine the temptation

50:42.680 --> 50:44.920
was just too great.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.160
Eh, Freddie?

50:46.200 --> 50:47.880
DWAYNE: Chief?

50:48.560 --> 50:49.840
You were right.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.960
I searched Freddie's house and found it but...

50:52.000 --> 50:55.320
Thank you, Dwayne. Finally, the bag of money.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.040
-Chief, I really think you should...

50:55.360 --> 50:58.040
-One moment, Dwayne.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.360
All along, we've been trying to work out

50:58.080 --> 51:01.360
who killed Marcus Knight.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.320
And the answer is

51:03.360 --> 51:05.840
anyone who wanted to get their hands on

51:03.360 --> 51:05.840
a quarter of a million pounds.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.120
I did try.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.160
Where's the money?

51:17.120 --> 51:18.880
There wasn't any.

51:19.960 --> 51:22.200
When I opened the bag, it was just...

51:23.560 --> 51:24.640
That.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.520
Yes, of course.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.640
That's why you broke back into the room

51:27.400 --> 51:29.640
the following night.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.520
Because you were still searching for the money.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.440
You didn't find it that time either, did you?

51:34.480 --> 51:35.680
Not with me interrupting you.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.120
There never was any money.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.600
What a waste of a life.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.120
HUMPHREY: Take him away, Dwayne.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.320
Okay, well,

52:01.800 --> 52:05.640
I think this calls for a celebration,

52:01.800 --> 52:05.640
don't you think, Aunty Mary?

52:05.680 --> 52:07.920
Oh, yes. I think so, Dwayne.

52:08.160 --> 52:10.560
JP, Sarge, a celebratory drink?

52:10.600 --> 52:11.960
Yes, let's go.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.800
We are going for a drink.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.000
No... Yes, of course.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.960
What is it, Humphrey? HUMPHREY:

52:20.000 --> 52:21.480
Well, I'm sorry, Aunty. It's just, um...

52:22.080 --> 52:25.920
Why would you put a load of old mementos

52:22.080 --> 52:25.920
into a safety deposit box?

52:25.960 --> 52:27.720
Because it's his old identity, sir?

52:27.880 --> 52:29.360
I mean, he'd want to keep it safe.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.600
Yes. No, I get that, JP. It's just...

52:32.640 --> 52:34.160
Why keep it safe in the Caribbean?

52:34.200 --> 52:36.480
I mean, why not just put it into storage in the UK?

52:36.880 --> 52:41.600
And if his possessions are worthy

52:36.880 --> 52:41.600
of a safety deposit box,

52:43.440 --> 52:44.720
then why not the money?

52:45.440 --> 52:48.480
But sir, we've looked. There's no money in that bag.

52:48.720 --> 52:52.160
-Maybe there

52:48.720 --> 52:52.160
never was any cash.

52:52.480 --> 52:56.640
Yeah, but he told Neil Jenkins he was here to

52:52.480 --> 52:56.640
collect his money.

52:57.480 --> 53:01.600
Then what if the bag itself is the money?

53:03.000 --> 53:07.320
With all due respect, Aunty Mary,

53:03.000 --> 53:07.320
the bag's not even worth $20.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.480
Yes, but what if it was?

53:10.160 --> 53:13.320
Yes, because what was Marcus's job again?

53:13.360 --> 53:17.520
He wasn't just an accountant to Neil Jenkins, was he?

53:17.640 --> 53:20.920
That's right, he worked for a diamond merchants.

53:21.080 --> 53:25.080
Chief, we looked inside and out, there's no way

53:21.080 --> 53:25.080
to hide anything.

53:25.160 --> 53:28.480
And yet, in the world of

53:25.160 --> 53:28.480
logic puzzles...

53:28.560 --> 53:31.600
It's always your assumptions that lead you astray.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.600
Ah. Yes, it is, isn't it?

53:36.680 --> 53:38.000
DWAYNE: No way.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.520
He knows where the money is.

53:52.800 --> 53:57.360
Now, that's how I'd hide a quarter of a million pounds.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.280
DWAYNE:  JP.

54:02.600 --> 54:06.520
Oh, Dwayne, don't worry. I haven't told

54:02.600 --> 54:06.520
Rosey how I feel.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.640
I've followed your advice down to the letter.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.720
Ah, good, but possibly it wasn't quite

54:09.680 --> 54:12.720
the best advice.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.440
Mmm

54:14.680 --> 54:16.600
You see, JP, I've got a friend.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.160
Yes, I know.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.920
No, no, no. I mean, I've got a friend.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.800
Oh, you've got a friend.

54:22.840 --> 54:24.720
Yeah, that's what I said. I've got a friend.

54:24.760 --> 54:25.960
It isn't me, by the way.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.600
-But this friend of mine,

54:27.640 --> 54:31.240
he sort of maybe kind of fell for this girl real bad

54:31.600 --> 54:33.800
and the one thing I sometimes wonder...

54:35.320 --> 54:37.520
The one thing your friend sometimes wonders.

54:37.600 --> 54:40.920
Of course, the one thing my friend sometimes wonders is

54:41.560 --> 54:45.640
what if he had told her how really serious

54:41.560 --> 54:45.640
he was about her?

54:48.240 --> 54:51.640
You think that might have turned out a bit different?

54:51.680 --> 54:53.560
No.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.320
But your advice...

54:55.800 --> 54:57.600
Your friend's advice...

54:58.080 --> 55:00.520
I should tell Rosey I love her?

55:00.560 --> 55:01.640
Yes! And soon.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.480
Because this friend of mine,

55:04.520 --> 55:05.880
he's got two female friends who are waiting

55:05.920 --> 55:08.160
to beat him up really bad if you don't.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.800
-Okay.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.920
Okay.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.960
Ah, JP, everything okay?

55:25.120 --> 55:26.520
Everything is just fine, Dwayne.

55:26.720 --> 55:29.080
You see, everything's just fine.

55:29.120 --> 55:33.120
And you both look like you need

55:29.120 --> 55:33.120
a little ti

55:33.160 --> 55:34.200
Well...

55:37.720 --> 55:40.800
So, you know, we couldn't have done it

55:37.720 --> 55:40.800
without you, Aunty.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.040
It was quite an adventure.

55:43.120 --> 55:44.760
Yes, I'll say.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.680
So, your memory was tip-top.

55:49.400 --> 55:52.360
And your puzzle-solving abilities

55:49.400 --> 55:52.360
were even...

55:53.320 --> 55:54.400
...tip-top-erer.

55:59.440 --> 56:03.040
You know, this has been one rocking-chair moment.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.520
What's one of those?

56:05.160 --> 56:09.640
When I'm sitting in my rocking chair

56:05.160 --> 56:09.640
and everything starts to go,

56:10.880 --> 56:14.760
I think there are some things I won't be able to forget.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.920
Like this.

56:19.080 --> 56:21.880
Like you, Humpty.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.240
SELWYN: So, Inspector,

56:26.280 --> 56:30.480
I just found this pack of cards

56:26.280 --> 56:30.480
by the backgammon set.

56:30.560 --> 56:32.000
Oh, gosh.

56:32.120 --> 56:37.120
Mary, do you think we should ask your nephew to perform

56:37.520 --> 56:40.720
one of his famous magic tricks, hmm?

56:40.920 --> 56:42.400
Oh, absolutely, Selwyn.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.240
No, look, really. Gosh,

56:42.440 --> 56:45.240
I mean, it's been so long.

56:45.280 --> 56:48.160
-I just don't... -Come on, Humphrey.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.760
Come on, chief.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.760
All right, then, JP, pick a card, any card.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.240
Okay.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.560
Now, don't let me see it.

56:57.600 --> 57:01.200
Show it to your friends and then place it

56:57.600 --> 57:01.200
back in the pack.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.520
Don't let me see it.

57:05.360 --> 57:08.240
Now, I can't possibly know what your card is.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.920
And by shuffling this pack,

57:09.960 --> 57:12.920
I can't possibly know where your card is.

57:14.240 --> 57:15.480
But...

57:16.120 --> 57:19.160
Tell me, did you choose a red card?

57:19.640 --> 57:20.640
JP: Yes.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.640
HUMPHREY: Was it a diamond?

57:25.480 --> 57:27.800
-Yes, sir.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.240
And that's exactly what I expected you to say,

57:30.280 --> 57:32.640
because the card you chose was the two of hearts.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.720
Ah, um, sorry.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.160
It's been a while.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.680
Ladies and gentlemen, the two of hearts.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.960
Right, bear with me. Wait, wait, here we go.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.560
Two of hearts.

57:47.640 --> 57:49.800
It was, um, queen of hearts.

57:49.840 --> 57:52.320
Two of hearts. Oh!

57:53.640 --> 57:56.600
It's got to be here somewhere. Wait,

57:53.640 --> 57:56.600
wait one second, it's coming.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.920
Two of hearts.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.880
The two of hearts.

58:00.880 --> 58:04.400
Catherine, there isn't even a two of hearts in this pack.

58:09.600 --> 58:11.760
ANOUK: Welcome to Le Calmar, Saint-Marie.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.200
Let the food do the talking.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.600
In here!

58:16.120 --> 58:19.080
Definitely attacked from behind,

58:16.120 --> 58:19.080
turned round and then...

58:20.880 --> 58:22.440
Hey! You little...

58:24.920 --> 58:27.040
Out of breath, Granddad?

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
My next lesson in the art of courtship.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.840
We want to have the full experience.
