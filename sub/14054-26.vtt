00:03.760 --> 00:05.910
Julie and Caleb's wedding invitation.
Getting married in...

00:06.080 --> 00:07.911
- Two weeks.
- Wow. They're really doing it. 

00:08.080 --> 00:10.355
I know it should be simple.
Your boyfriend hits you...

00:10.520 --> 00:12.590
...you leave him. Right?
- It's never simple.

00:12.760 --> 00:16.389
You're probably a fan of the classics.
Superman? No? Batman?

00:16.560 --> 00:20.155
You probably really need Ryan right now.
Me being here, I'm getting in the way.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.754
- It's more than twice what we put into it.
- Caught me at a good time.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.151
- He's up to something.
- I don't care. $2.5 million.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.151
You and me, we're gonna be fine.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.032
Ryan.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.714
Ryan, hey. Hey, man, are you asleep?

00:42.920 --> 00:44.114
Ryan.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.875
Ryan. Are you asleep?
Yeah, I can't sleep either.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.919
I know what you're gonna say. You know,
she hasn't technically dumped me yet...

00:53.080 --> 00:55.640
...but it's only a matter of time, right?
So, what do I do?

00:55.800 --> 00:58.155
Do I force a confrontation
or do I just continue...

00:58.320 --> 01:01.915
...to be whiny and passive-aggressive
until she realizes what a catch I am?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.034
Ryan?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.634
- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. You asleep?
- Yeah.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.870
Sorry.
I'm gonna let you go back to sleep, okay?

01:09.160 --> 01:11.549
As bad as things are for me,
they're worse for you.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.709
What?

01:12.880 --> 01:16.236
I'm at least in my own bed not sleeping.
You're on my floor not sleeping.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.597
- Because you won't stop talking.
- But also because your ex-girlfriend...

01:19.760 --> 01:22.752
...is sleeping in your room,
to the dismay of your girlfriend.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.956
- Marissa's fine with it.
- I'm sure she is.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.237
The same way you'd be fine with it if
Oliver was sleeping on her couch.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.389
It's cool.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.312
What, you want me to kick Theresa out?

01:31.480 --> 01:34.677
No. But aren't you just the least bit
curious as to when she's leaving?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.592
No, I'm not. I'm not worried about it.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.795
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.396
Good. Night. Go back to bed.
Or the floor.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.715
- I should talk to Theresa.
- Let me come with you.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.514
- Theresa?
- Housekeeping.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.638
- Hello?
- Maybe she's still at work.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.314
- Her bag's here.
- Yeah. Apparently, she's been shopping.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.836
Sorry. I didn't hear you guys come in.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.197
Let me know if you ever need anything.
My mom's got lots of toiletries.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.949
Thanks, but I'm probably not
gonna be here that much longer.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.117
You're not?

02:22.280 --> 02:25.113
No, I can't impose
on Seth's parents forever.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.918
- Sure you can. I intend to.
- Thanks...

02:27.080 --> 02:31.153
...but I really need to figure things out.
I have some family I can call, so...

02:33.240 --> 02:35.356
So see you tomorrow?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.875
No. I picked up a morning shift
at the bakery, so...

02:38.040 --> 02:40.190
Oh, all right. So maybe after school?

02:41.000 --> 02:45.391
- Sure. But aren't you and Marissa...?
- Yeah. No, I mean we'll both see you.

02:45.560 --> 02:49.792
We'll all see you, because my girlfriend's
currently dating her father, which to me...

02:49.960 --> 02:52.076
- Seth.
- We'll talk about this tomorrow.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.151
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.517
All right, good night.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.108
Night.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.996
So, what's it gonna be, Cal?
The Hyatt Newporter?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.993
The pool at the Four Seasons Hotel
where everybody gets married?

03:58.160 --> 04:00.754
Or the beautiful glass cathedral
overlooking the ocean...

04:00.920 --> 04:02.558
...at the Wayfarer's Chapel?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.315
I have to get to work.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.994
Whatever you like, Juju.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.468
Sorry about breakfast, Kiki.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.474
Dad, the only reason we're having
this breakfast is so we can do some work.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.438
You have been so busy with the wedding,
I haven't even seen you.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.593
Every time I've asked him to help me
with the wedding, he says he's with you.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.797
Really? So, CayCay,
what have you been doing all this time?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.393
Don't you have someplace to be?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.835
As a matter of fact,
I'm meeting Jimmy for breakfast.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.309
I bet even that sounds pretty good
to you right now.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.118
The Wayfarer Chapel it is.

04:36.280 --> 04:39.955
Well, are you sure? I mean, these photos
don't really do it justice. You know what?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.714
I should take you up there this weekend,
you'll love it.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.598
I wish I could. I'm out of town.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.672
What? Since when? You can't go.
We're getting married next week.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.035
Just one night. Business.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.236
Business where?

04:52.400 --> 04:55.358
- Nevada.
- Nevada. As in Las Vegas, Nevada?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.188
- Actually...
- You're going out of town for one night...

04:58.360 --> 05:00.920
...to Vegas on business? What business?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.229
There is no business.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.392
You're going to Vegas
because you're having a bachelor party.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.869
- Some of the investors and I are...
- Hiring strippers...

05:08.040 --> 05:11.510
...drinking too much and gambling all
night the weekend before our wedding?

05:11.680 --> 05:14.274
It sounds like a bachelor party to me.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.398
I have to admit,
I feel a little hurt that I wasn't invited.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.994
- Yeah, me too.
- Not that I have any affection for you.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.833
You know that. But I do love the Vegas.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.515
- I didn't know you love the Vegas, Dad.
- I love the Vegas. I love the Vegas.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.352
Ryan, how do you feel about the Vegas?

05:28.520 --> 05:30.829
Never been to the Vegas.
Mom was all about the Reno.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.037
Dad, we should go. You love Vegas.
Ryan and I have never been.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.112
He can use his mutant
card-counting abilities to pay for the trip.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.158
- Sounds like fun for the whole family.
- What about Theresa?

05:40.320 --> 05:42.754
Well, I can take care of Theresa.
You guys should go.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.070
Do I have any say in this?

05:45.240 --> 05:46.559
No.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.071
Enjoy your bachelor party.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.592
Hey. Ready for breakfast?

06:01.760 --> 06:04.911
Almost. My realtor is on her way.
I just have to give her the contract.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.229
Contract for what?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.958
Well, with any luck...

06:09.160 --> 06:10.513
...my new house.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.156
Jimmy, it's right on the beach.
It's perfect.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.039
I want to give Marissa a home
she can be proud of. You know?

06:16.200 --> 06:18.350
What are you gonna do
with your half of Caleb's money?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.351
I'm taking some of it
to Vegas this weekend.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.751
The boys and I are crashing
his bachelor party. You want to come?

06:23.920 --> 06:27.629
Are you kidding? The man bailed us out,
took Julie off my hands.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.279
I'll buy him his first lap dance.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.270
Hell, I'll give him one myself. Can you
grab that? I just gotta get the contract.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.435
Hi. Gail van Deepen. You must be Sandy.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.670
- Yeah.
- Congratulations on selling the restaurant.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.114
You must have made a fortune.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.477
I heard Robert Campbell is gonna turn
that area into an outdoor mall.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.234
Robert Campbell?
We sold the restaurant to Caleb Nichol.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.234
Then I guess Caleb is gonna make
a fortune. Well, another fortune, right?

06:53.400 --> 06:57.313
But you and Jimmy must have made good
money. What are you gonna do next?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.038
I wanna kill him.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.589
Then I'd probably go to jail,
but it would be better...

07:02.760 --> 07:05.149
...than having to move in
with him and my mom, right?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.629
That way, I won't have to tell my dad
I'm moving out.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.233
You still haven't told him?

07:10.040 --> 07:12.270
What am I supposed to say,
that Caleb's blackmailing me?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.908
My dad'll kill him
and I'll have to move in with my mom.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.559
So, what are you gonna tell him?

07:17.040 --> 07:19.952
I don't know, but I guess
I have to do it by this weekend, huh?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.190
Your dad might be going
to Vegas this weekend.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.873
How do you know?

07:24.280 --> 07:26.430
Because I might be going
to Vegas this weekend.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.874
For what?

07:28.040 --> 07:29.712
- Caleb's bachelor party.
- What?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.952
With, like, strippers and prostitutes
and showgirls?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.429
I don't know, I hope so.
What? No. I'm not gonna go.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.397
I can't leave Theresa here by herself.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.471
Theresa? What about me?

07:40.560 --> 07:43.028
You know what I mean.
You got Summer and your sister.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.952
Theresa, she's got nobody.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.958
Well, she's got me.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.517
I mean, I am your girlfriend, right?

07:52.440 --> 07:56.274
So, I mean, any friend of yours
is a friend of mine.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.998
Right?

08:03.760 --> 08:06.638
- You are my girlfriend.
- Glad to hear it.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.278
- Now, about those strippers...
- What strippers? I don't know of any stri...

08:12.440 --> 08:14.829
I don't want Chippendales.
I want strippers.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.878
Full-on, full-frontal male strippers.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.793
Preferably at a place
that serves bottomless margaritas.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.713
Or I could invite the girls over
and I could throw you...

08:24.880 --> 08:27.314
...a lovely,
catered bachelorette cocktail party.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.914
- With strippers.
- Without strippers.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.594
Julie, we are smart, sophisticated women.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.231
We don't need strange, naked men
dancing in front of us to be entertained.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.957
I'm not as smart as you.
Plus, the boys are getting strippers.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.076
The boys are not getting strippers.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.994
Kirsten, it's Las Vegas. You get strippers
as a side with your entr Áe.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.671
They're getting strippers. Why else
would Sandy go to Vegas with Caleb?

08:52.840 --> 08:54.159
Strippers, huh?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.390
Get all the Newpsies into limos,
drive to L. A...

08:56.560 --> 08:58.835
...have dinner on Sunset,
then head south to Mantopia.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.991
- Or the Stud Farm.
- You've done research.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.835
Todd in Accounting, who also told me
about this place called The Petting Zoo.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.558
It's not exactly legal, but...

09:06.720 --> 09:09.553
Julie, I am not going to a place
called The Petting Zoo.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.358
You don't know where the pets
have been.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.993
We'll be too drunk to care.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.073
- No strippers.
- Just one stripper? Please?

09:17.240 --> 09:19.800
Just one little stripper
who never hurt anyone...

09:19.960 --> 09:22.349
...who's just trying to make his way
in the world?

09:22.840 --> 09:24.512
Naked.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.352
One little stripper.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.994
Yes! You're the best.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.838
But no Chippendales.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.151
And not little.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.714
A bachelor party?

09:36.280 --> 09:38.840
Where really anything could happen.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.714
Good to know.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.791
Yeah. Just kind of
a courtesy thing, really.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.077
Seeing as how, last time I checked,
we're still boyfriend and girlfriend.

09:46.240 --> 09:50.552
Even though you've been ignoring me in
the halls and don't return any of my calls.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.358
I didn't mean for that to rhyme.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.916
- Look, Cohen...
- I just want you to tell me...

09:55.080 --> 09:58.197
...that you're not gonna let
what your dad thinks of me break us up.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.638
- He's my dad.
- So what?

10:05.800 --> 10:09.839
Summer, I don't care about your dad.
Okay? I care about you a lot.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.956
And if that's not good enough for you...

10:13.760 --> 10:16.718
Obviously, that's not good enough
for you, so I'll go to Vegas.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.353
Wait.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.116
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.918
How was work? How you feeling?

10:29.080 --> 10:33.073
Good. I'm actually going back.
I picked up another shift tonight.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.118
Marissa and I were kind of hoping
we could all hang out.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.593
Yeah, I can't. I have to make money
if I'm gonna go to Atlanta.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.952
- Atlanta?
- Yeah, my cousin Kim lives in Atlanta.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.839
She said I can go stay with her
as long as I pay my own way.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.077
I mean, she doesn't have
a pool house or anything...

10:52.360 --> 10:54.954
...but that way,
maybe I can get a second chance too.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.597
How much you need?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.229
I can't take your money.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.236
- I don't even... Two thousand dollars?
- I'll ask the Cohens.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.674
No, you won't.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.118
Listen to me.
This is not your problem, okay?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.433
Go. Win. Make money.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.192
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.591
Two thousand dollars, huh?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.830
Well, I've got about...

11:35.000 --> 11:38.515
I'd say I've got about a thousand
in savings bonds, bar mitzvah bucks.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.272
I could throw in a couple hundred.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.919
I can't ask you guys to do that.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.672
You didn't ask. We volunteered.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.872
Thanks, but it's still not enough.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.476
You could make it enough. Take that
money to Vegas and triple it at blackjack.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.279
It's been a while
since I've done the card-counting thing.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.989
Listen, I'm gonna start you off slow.
If you suck, I'm just gonna cut you off.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.477
- How do we get in the casinos?
- I think we'd use our fake IDs.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.438
- You have fake IDs?
- C.D. Sebulski, it's good to meet you.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.034
- Have you met Marty Nayfis?
- Oh, God.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.550
Okay, look, you guys go to Vegas.
I'll take care of Theresa.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.396
If you win, great. If not,
well, then Theresa never has to know.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.752
- What do you have to lose?
- Just $ 1000 in bar mitzvah bonds.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.512
But other than that, nothing.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.518
You in?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.195
Marty, are you in?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.349
I'm in.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.237
- I love the Vegas.
- Reno was never like this.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.599
What is this place?

13:08.760 --> 13:13.231
This is the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.
According to Seth, it's ground zero...

13:13.400 --> 13:15.516
...for aging hipsters like yourself.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.512
I thought we were going to Caesar's.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.194
Caesar's didn't have
a permanent Springsteen exhibit.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.112
Although they do have Celine Dion.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.679
Yet another reason we're here.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.435
- Mock if you must, but she can sing.
- You're gonna regret saying that...

13:28.600 --> 13:30.670
...on your birthday.
- Yeah, really.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.592
Welcome to Hard Rock.
My name is Amy.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.478
Which one of you is Mr. Cohen?

13:34.640 --> 13:37.200
Hi, Amy, we spoke on the phone.
It's good to see you.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.238
Yes, good to see you. We have
the penthouse all ready for you.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.674
If you will follow me.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.831
- Penthouse?
- Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.798
- So whose card did you put that on?
- Oh, please, the old man's.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.791
Oh, I love you, son. I love you.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.473
I love you too, Dad.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.838
Just not as much as I love Vegas.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.673
The casino, restaurants, pool and spa
are all on this level.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.308
And if you'll follow me,
I'll show you our bowling alley.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.959
God, there's a bowling alley?

14:00.120 --> 14:02.634
Yes, sir. It's in your room.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.154
Did you see that?

14:05.320 --> 14:08.039
I just almost bowled a strike.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.273
In our hotel room, man.
I'm never going home.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.952
It's like a million-dollar frat house.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.509
I know. It's fantastic.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.191
Well, I'm gonna explore the casino.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.998
May I give you gentlemen a tour?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.752
No, I'll find my way. Thanks.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.559
- We're good. Thanks, Amy.
- Thanks.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.270
Actually, you know what?
We'll take that tour.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.315
Sure. I just need to see some ID.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.955
It's just a formality. We have
a lot of kids under 21 using fake IDs...

14:42.120 --> 14:46.352
...to get onto the casino floor. We'd hate
to have to throw them out of the hotel.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.348
You know what? I don't think
we're gonna need that tour.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.431
- But thank you for stopping by.
- Absolutely.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.033
Really sweet.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.557
What are we gonna do? I don't
wanna get thrown out. I love the hotel.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.312
- Me too.
- I wanna marry the hotel...

15:01.480 --> 15:03.391
...and have gambling-addicted,
alcoholic kids.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.835
- We'll find another casino.
- What, a youth casino?

15:07.320 --> 15:08.514
Seth, it's Vegas.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.036
You wanna find some action in this town,
all you gotta do is ask.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.311
Winner. Pay the line.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.078
Yeah.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.117
Where are we doing this?

15:25.040 --> 15:28.555
No, I'm at the Hard Rock, of all places.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.914
Fine.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.399
I'm on my cell.

15:31.560 --> 15:35.599
- So where's the party?
- There is no party, just a quiet dinner.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.228
Hey, have you figured out what
you're gonna do with the restaurant?

15:38.400 --> 15:41.233
Not yet. You figured out
what you're gonna do with that money...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.992
...that I paid you for it?

15:43.160 --> 15:45.230
I'm putting all mine on the hard ways.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.198
Jimmy's gonna buy a house
for himself and Marissa.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.708
Really?

15:51.960 --> 15:55.350
Last time I talked to Marissa,
she was planning on moving in with us.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.240
- <i>ever gonna stop being mad at me, Ada?</i>

16:06.840 --> 16:10.594
I'm sorry, but does it strike anyone else
as tragic that the boys are in Las Vegas...

16:10.760 --> 16:14.309
...doing God knows what, while we sit
here watching <i>The Valley</i> marathon?

16:14.480 --> 16:17.313
Hey, it's Summ's favorite show, okay?

16:17.480 --> 16:18.913
Right, Summ?

16:19.080 --> 16:21.355
- Are you crying?
- No.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.275
It's a sad episode.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.112
- She broke up with Seth.
- Coop.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.872
- What? Why?
- Her dad doesn't approve.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.314
- Coop.
- Please.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.392
You think my dad approves
of Jimmy Cooper? The man's a felon.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.754
No offense.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.718
Yeah, I know. Anyway,
my mom still doesn't approve of Ryan.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.474
It's like a rule. Your parents almost have
to disapprove.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.790
Otherwise, the sex isn't good.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.674
- Was that an over-share?
- Yeah. He kind of is my dad.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.834
Yeah, I'll get the door.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.873
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.712
Can I talk to you?

16:58.120 --> 16:59.519
Alone?

16:59.680 --> 17:02.399
- Let's move.
- Yeah.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.635
- You want me to get you a stripper?
- Not me. Julie.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.994
And I only ask because...

17:11.160 --> 17:13.469
...you were a stripper.
- Can I ask you something?

17:13.640 --> 17:16.029
- How did you get yourself into this?
- I wish I knew.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.474
Does she have a picture of you
wearing culottes?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.039
You don't even like Julie.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.273
Marissa's still here.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.839
And that's not entirely true.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.353
You let her walk all over you.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.351
You're upset
because she's marrying Dad.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.273
Yeah, for his money.
Same reason that she married Jimmy.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.676
Well, she's not your biggest fan either.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.478
So why am I getting her a stripper?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.517
Because if you don't...

17:36.960 --> 17:40.032
...she's gonna make me take her
to a place called The Petting Zoo...

17:40.200 --> 17:43.078
...which, according to Todd
in Accounting, they pet.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.478
You know what? I'll do it.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.316
If Julie Cooper wants a stripper...

17:48.480 --> 17:50.232
...I know just the man for the job.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.352
Thank you.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.715
We live in an age of miracles. Look at
them frolic. Look how much fun that is.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.313
Bowling alleys in the penthouse.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.314
You know what I'm saying? Hotel rooms?
Beaches in the middle of the desert.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.951
There's so many bikini-clad women,
I haven't thought about Summer since...

18:18.120 --> 18:19.997
Since you left a message
on her machine?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.673
Sure, but that was 20 minutes ago.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.876
I'm feeling liberated now. Confident.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.032
Like I could walk up to any one
of these women and just...

18:27.200 --> 18:28.713
...converse.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.074
Know what I'm saying?

18:30.240 --> 18:31.878
Great, go for it.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.196
The thing is,
I don't want to be rude to you.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.918
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.755
But I can't. I can't just go up
to a strange girl and say...

18:42.920 --> 18:45.150
Excuse me.
Would you mind if I kissed you?

18:45.320 --> 18:46.753
Are you talking to me?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.957
Sorry. The Hard Rock's kind of exclusive.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.317
You can't use the beach
unless you're with a guest, so I'm Jenn.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.357
- Seth.
- And you are an excellent kisser.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.954
Can I buy you guys a drink? Say thanks.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.829
Yeah, I think we're out, so that...

19:05.000 --> 19:06.911
Could you hold on one second?
It's Summer.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.596
- Hey.
- Cohen.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.076
- Listen, I've been thinking.
- Yeah.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.592
Hey, I have to kiss you again.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.352
- What?
- What?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.995
Cohen? What is going on over there?

19:21.640 --> 19:23.437
<i>You're an amazing kisser.</i>

19:24.400 --> 19:26.914
Hold that thought, please. Hey, Summer.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.516
- Hello?
- He's kissing another girl.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.838
Yes. Right in front of me on the phone.
I can't believe this.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.834
I have been crying actual tears
over that ass, and he's kissing randoms.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.594
Okay, you know what?
We're gonna have a girls' night out.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.069
Theresa's coming over.
We can do whatever you want.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.757
Really? Because all I want to do right now
is go to Las Vegas and kick Cohen's ass.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.638
- She's gonna kick my ass.
- Yeah.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.712
- Was that your girlfriend?
- "Was" being the operative word there.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.438
I'm so sorry. I should go.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.876
I shouldn't even be here. I should go.
I have a paper to write, anyway.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.032
- Yeah, we should probably go too, so...
- Where are you guys headed?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.430
- Can I give you a lift?
- You have a car here?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.472
I live here. I go to UNLV.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.192
English major.
With a weakness for fake beaches.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.634
What about you guys?

20:10.240 --> 20:11.559
- Just visiting.
- Yeah.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.393
- We're looking for a blackjack game.
- It's sort of business.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.834
I don't know about blackjack...

20:16.000 --> 20:18.753
...but a couple of guys from my class
are doing this poker thing.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.353
It's a kind of intense, though.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.479
Wanna go?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.119
- Sure.
- Sure.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.038
- Hey.
- How'd it go with Caleb?

20:36.200 --> 20:38.668
He stonewalled me. I got nothing.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.479
Maybe he's just out here
for his bachelor party.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.073
Yeah, right. A bachelor party...

20:43.240 --> 20:45.390
...where Robert Campbell
just happened to stop by...

20:45.560 --> 20:48.120
...and pay him half a billion dollars
for the coastline.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.397
So he's profiting from our loss.
He's Caleb Nichol.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.916
That's what he does. He paid us a huge
amount of money for that restaurant.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.390
- He's the reason I could bid on a house.
- You may want to retract that bid...

20:58.560 --> 21:01.472
...because according to Caleb,
Marissa's moving in with him.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.228
Summer had to go home,
but she wants us to call if we go out.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.750
I don't feel like going out much,
if that's okay.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.434
Yeah. No, of course it's okay.
We'll just order in.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.239
You want, like, Indian? Chinese? Sushi?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.470
No, not sushi. I can't do raw fish.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.200
Okay. Well, what about
something else to drink?

21:20.360 --> 21:23.113
I think we have, like, juice, soda...
Beer?

21:23.280 --> 21:24.599
No, I can't.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.318
I mean, I shouldn't. Thanks.

21:26.680 --> 21:31.071
You can't drink, you can't have sushi.
What, are you pregnant?

21:33.080 --> 21:34.479
Oh, my God. Are you pregnant?

21:56.680 --> 21:58.750
- We're just playing Texas Hold'em, right?
- Yep.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.275
Last time I was here,
it was, like, a 250 buy-in.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.476
As in $250?

22:03.640 --> 22:04.834
Why, you play?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.149
Yeah, just for fun.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.788
Well, it was fun,
until last time I lost that 250.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.473
These guys, they don't play for fun.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.396
- You do know how to play poker, right?
- Yeah.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.313
I haven't played in a while, but...

22:29.480 --> 22:32.040
- How about I go buy us a drink.
- Okay.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.638
- Look, we don't have to do this.
- Yeah, well, what about Theresa?

22:37.800 --> 22:40.837
- Theresa's not your responsibility.
- Not yours either, yet here we are.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.149
So listen...

22:42.320 --> 22:45.790
...I love the Vegas.
It's time to see if the Vegas loves me.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.674
Howdy.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.468
I haven't told anyone.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.959
Not my mom. Not Eddie.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.476
Especially not Ryan.
You're the only one who knows, so...

23:12.640 --> 23:14.437
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I promise.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.395
- Do you not want to talk about this?
- I've been going crazy keeping it to myself.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.509
Okay. So do you know
what you want to do?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.798
I don't even have the money
to get to Atlanta...

23:27.960 --> 23:33.034
...so I have no idea
how I would pay for an...

23:38.120 --> 23:40.475
I mean, even if I had the baby...

23:41.480 --> 23:45.314
...I work in a bakery.
You know, what am I supposed to do?

23:46.120 --> 23:49.157
- Well, maybe if you talked to Eddie...
- No, I can't.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.677
He'll try to convince me to marry him
and have the baby.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.477
- Or else he'll say it isn't his.
- Who else's could it be?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.956
All in.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.152
Twenty-five hundred.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.758
Pocket aces.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.116
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?

25:17.280 --> 25:20.078
We got your bar mitzvah money,
Theresa's money. Now we gotta go.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.073
No. What about the Ryan-and-Seth-
going-to-Europe money, my man?

25:23.240 --> 25:25.515
- Get back in there. We can get Vespas.
- Vespas?

25:25.680 --> 25:27.159
Yeah, it's Europe.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.517
Harleys. I don't know. The point is,
why quit when you're ahead?

25:30.680 --> 25:33.797
If we don't, Angry Trucker Hat
over there is gonna hurt me.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.708
Maybe he's not angry at you.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.553
He's angry because he found out
people don't wear trucker hats anymore.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.950
Come on.
I'm doing so good with Jenn, I think.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.758
Invite her back to the hotel room.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.913
It is kind of sweaty in here. I'd like
to do that. But how am I gonna do that?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.034
Hey.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.395
So, Seth and I were wondering...

25:52.560 --> 25:55.711
...if...
- lf you would come to our hotel room...

25:55.880 --> 25:58.440
...and go bowling,
which is not as weird as it sounds.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.431
Are you guys staying in the penthouse?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.593
My girlfriends and I have always wanted to
rent that for a night, but it's so expensive.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.636
Yeah, well, you should call them.
You should bring them over.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.357
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Call them.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.919
Okay. Thanks.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.838
Now, isn't this better
than some seedy Hollywood club?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.353
When's the stripper getting here?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.954
Don't tell me.
I want it to be a surprise.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.755
- Surprise.
- I'll get it.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.992
Maybe I better go with you.
You know...

26:44.160 --> 26:47.072
...in case it's a UPS man
and I have to sign for the package.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.676
Or maybe it's a plumber
and he needs to tighten my pipes.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.276
Or, you know what, what if it's...?
Hailey.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.469
- What are you doing here?
- Kirsten invited me, since you forgot.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.073
My memory's fine.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.832
- Crab cakes.
- I can't stay.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.798
I saw a fire truck out front and wanted
to make sure everything was okay.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.359
Fire truck?

27:07.640 --> 27:08.959
Is it hot in here?

27:10.680 --> 27:12.159
Or is it just me?

27:35.720 --> 27:38.598
Hailey, I said one stripper.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.797
- Hello?
- Hey.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.154
Thank God it's you.

28:04.320 --> 28:08.518
There are four male strippers dressed
as firemen dancing in our living room.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.557
Theme stripping, you gotta love that.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.234
Oh, wait.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.630
Now they're not dressed
as anything at all.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.438
Try to keep them off the furniture.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.556
<i>So how's everything going in Vegas?</i>

28:20.720 --> 28:23.712
Let me ask you something.
Do you find it odd that after your father...

28:23.880 --> 28:26.599
...bought into the restaurant,
as powerful as he is...

28:26.760 --> 28:28.478
...we were still denied our liquor license?

28:28.640 --> 28:32.519
Yeah, but the guy that was on the liquor
board was an ex-client of Jimmy's.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.035
So your dad doesn't know anyone
on the liquor board?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.998
He knows everyone. But why
would he do something like that?

28:38.160 --> 28:39.718
He was a partner in the restaurant.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.190
So he could buy us out cheap, turn
around and sell it to Robert Campbell...

28:43.360 --> 28:44.509
...for 10 times as much.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.039
Sandy, he wouldn't do that.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.590
Honey, when are you gonna realize
there is nothing your dad wouldn't do?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.718
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna talk to your father.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.078
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yeah.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.954
I'm proud of you, man.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.076
Not as proud
as if we were on Vespas, but...

29:00.240 --> 29:02.276
- Right.
- Jenn, we're gonna do strip bowling.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.113
I'm not a very good bowler,
so you'll probably see my tush.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.358
Go ahead.
I'm gonna catch up. All right?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.112
- Yeah. Hurry up.
- Okay.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.471
Hey, I still haven't heard from you.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.757
Just want to make sure you're okay.
Ryan's here. He'd like to say hi...

29:16.920 --> 29:19.798
...so give us a call back, okay?
Love you, kiddo.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.276
Been calling all day.
She hasn't picked up.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.714
Everything okay?

29:23.880 --> 29:28.556
Listen. Do you know anything about
Marissa moving in with Caleb and Julie?

29:29.480 --> 29:30.913
Yeah.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.433
- She finally told you?
- No, she didn't.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.358
Caleb told Sandy.
Is there something I should know?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.158
What?

29:41.320 --> 29:44.039
Nothing. I just don't know why
he'd do that. They had a deal.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.879
Deal?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.996
What kind of deal?

29:52.360 --> 29:53.713
Move.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.953
Hi. The name is Cohen. C-O-H-E-N.
I think that's how you spell it.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.076
You can pretty much see
the entire strip from here.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.840
Yeah. You can see it from here too.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.834
It's very impressive.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.190
Wait till you see what happens next.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.796
I would, actually. I would like that
very much, to see what happens next.

30:19.960 --> 30:23.839
The thing is, I'm kind of in love with
my girlfriend, and that makes it weird.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.912
- Ex-girlfriend. Right?
- That's a good point.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.512
Cohen!

30:36.880 --> 30:39.553
- Summer?
- I tried to stop her.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.631
Get away from him, whore.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.597
She's not a whore, okay?
She goes to UNLV.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.955
Oh, you know, I'm sorry. Skank!

30:46.120 --> 30:47.712
Hello?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.951
Did somebody order more skanks?

30:54.120 --> 30:59.717
Come on in, you guys. Ryan, Seth,
this is Valerie, Shannon and Grace.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.396
Aren't you gonna introduce me?

31:05.640 --> 31:07.517
What are you doing here, Lucas?

31:07.680 --> 31:10.592
This many girls, I'm gonna need
payment before the party.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.830
Wait, no. Payment? Are you...?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.195
- You're a prostitute.
- I knew it!

31:15.360 --> 31:19.035
So four girls till midnight,
plus, you had Jenn all afternoon.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.430
No, man,
I think I've been had all afternoon.

31:22.400 --> 31:27.076
Either way, it's 250 an hour,
which brings us to a grand total...

31:28.400 --> 31:29.594
...of $5000.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.830
So, what will it be, gentlemen?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.672
Cash, check or charge?

31:44.400 --> 31:46.311
I hate the Vegas.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.429
My entire life,
I've never even seen a prostitute...

31:49.600 --> 31:52.239
...now I have four of them taking
advantage of me in my hotel room.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.311
And not in a nice way.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.471
- Way to go, whore-boy.
- Thanks.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.437
All right.
Summer, how much money you got?

31:58.600 --> 32:01.319
I'm not giving you money.
I'm not the one that was worked on.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.835
I wasn't worked on. Okay?
I was entrapped.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.150
This is your fault.
You broke up with me.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.153
- So you hire a call girl?
- What, your dad wouldn't approve?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.788
- This has nothing to do with my dad.
- Right. It doesn't.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.837
Okay. So maybe I overreacted a little.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.195
- Yeah, a little.
- Lf you didn't try so hard with him...

32:16.360 --> 32:18.874
I only did that because I knew
it was important to you.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.155
You swear nothing else happened
with the ho?

32:27.320 --> 32:29.959
I swear. One kiss.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.318
- Maybe four.
- I hope you enjoyed them...

32:32.480 --> 32:35.199
...because if anything like this
happens again, I'll kill you.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.477
You won't have to. If we don't
get 5000 soon, her pimp will.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.391
Between my money and Theresa's money,
it's only 3000.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.631
Three thousand five hundred.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.352
Thanks...

32:53.680 --> 32:55.830
...but that still leaves us 1500 short.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.590
You guys did buy us till midnight.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.991
That's more than enough time
for another game of no-limit Hold'em.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.440
That's a card game, not hooker talk.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.798
Well, that was some performance.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.235
Believe me...

33:16.400 --> 33:18.118
...that was nothing.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.071
- What are you doing after the party?
- Getting married.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.591
Yeah, but not tonight. Right?

33:32.160 --> 33:33.309
Let me get my purse.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.830
- Thanks for the party.
- You're leaving?

33:40.000 --> 33:44.118
I'm exhausted, and the boys
are getting back from Vegas early, so...

33:46.400 --> 33:49.392
Please tell me your sister's
not hitting on that poor stripper.

33:50.520 --> 33:54.798
Oh, they're old friends.
In fact, Hailey set this whole thing up.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.951
She did? Really?

33:57.920 --> 33:59.319
Excuse me.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.399
So, what was the plan, Hailey?

34:05.760 --> 34:10.150
Get your stripper friend to proposition me,
tell Daddy about it, the wedding's off?

34:10.320 --> 34:14.233
Please, I know you'd never sleep with
Jeff. He doesn't make enough money.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.272
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

34:17.760 --> 34:20.638
Well, you married Jimmy for his money,
and now my dad.

34:20.800 --> 34:24.952
You see, Jeffrey here might be a stripper,
but, honey, you're a whore.

34:28.159 --> 34:31.197
- You're going down, bitch.
- Who are you calling "bitch," bitch?

34:31.360 --> 34:34.511
Oh, my God. Hailey! Stop it!

34:35.400 --> 34:37.277
Ladies!

34:54.440 --> 34:57.750
I never liked you,
even when you were a little twerp!

34:58.480 --> 34:59.708
Come on!

35:01.720 --> 35:03.836
Hey, how are you?
I'm meeting someone here.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.992
Caleb! There you are. I'm so glad
you guys didn't start eating without me.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.869
Mr. Campbell, how are you? Sandy Cohen.
Caleb's son-in-law. Former partner.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.871
- How is the food here?
- Filet's excellent.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.837
- Really?
- Would you care to join us?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.230
- Actually, we should just...
- Don't mind if I do.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.995
So I understand that you're interested
in Caleb's Balboa coastline property.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.877
I can see why. It is the perfect location.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.838
You mind? I'm parched.

35:31.680 --> 35:35.673
As a matter of fact, some partners and I
recently tried to open a restaurant there.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.549
Not unlike this one, except we had
two kinds of meat loaf and dirty martinis.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.312
The problem was,
we could not get a liquor license...

35:43.640 --> 35:46.552
...and for the longest time,
we couldn't figure out why.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.109
- Sandy, this is not the time.
- You gonna eat that?

35:49.280 --> 35:52.477
Turns out, one of our partners
went behind our backs...

35:52.640 --> 35:56.349
...to a friend on the city council and
got them to deny us the liquor license.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.476
So he bought us out,
and now he's peddling...

35:58.640 --> 36:02.474
...that piece of property
at a much higher price to someone else.

36:02.640 --> 36:06.155
- Robert, I have to ask you to excuse us.
- The problem is, the joke's on him.

36:06.920 --> 36:10.708
Not only is he guilty of collusion
and fraud, but he and his property...

36:10.880 --> 36:13.633
...are going to be tied up
in civil litigation for months.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.951
Years, if I have anything to say about it.

36:17.320 --> 36:22.155
The bottom line: That coastline property,
it's absolutely worthless.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.592
What do you think of that?

36:24.760 --> 36:27.149
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hands off! You wanna go?

36:27.320 --> 36:30.949
- We'll go. Come on. I'll take you...
- Sandy, don't. Let me.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.878
You think you can manipulate me?!
Hold my daughter hostage?!

36:36.040 --> 36:38.554
Easy, easy. What are you doing?
You beat me to the punch.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.837
We'll see you back in Newport, Dad.
Come on. Go, go.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.399
Five hundred. You got nothing.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.229
I'm out.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.156
- I need you to lend me some money.
- What?

37:10.320 --> 37:13.756
No. No way. You just lost, like, $3000.
There's no way I'm lending you money.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.433
Then I guess you don't get paid.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.389
Look, this is not a game, okay? You
and your friends could get seriously hurt.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.834
Yeah, whose fault is that?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.514
I was just doing my job.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.478
You guys were staying in the penthouse.
I thought you had money.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.076
I don't understand.
This afternoon you were doing so good.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.834
Now you suck.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.796
So I guess Angry Trucker Hat's
feeling pretty confident right now.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.393
Wouldn't you say?

37:43.560 --> 37:44.913
You lost on purpose?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.196
I won a lot of money this afternoon.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.438
Now I need yours.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.752
Deal me in.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.790
I can't believe he gave you
his angry trucker hat.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.473
He didn't give it to me, I won it.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.039
That's not really winning then.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.397
Be nice, Cohen.
He paid off your pimps and your ho's.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.552
Yeah. I did lose
your bar mitzvah money, though. Sorry.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.678
I lost my bar mitzvah money, okay?
And I also lost Theresa's money...

38:19.840 --> 38:22.957
...which is the only reason you came.
- No, it's not the only reason.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.475
- You don't think the trip's a total waste?
- No, no.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.110
We won some, we lost some. We're
walking out of Vegas pretty much even.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.033
I'd say some of us
are walking out ahead.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.991
I think if it were up to you,
we wouldn't be walking out of here at all.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.357
- Now we have a good Vegas story.
- I don't think you wanna tell people...

38:40.520 --> 38:43.432
...that you lost your bar mitzvah money
on prostitutes.

38:43.840 --> 38:47.196
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.875
- I thought that was Tijuana.
- I think that hat should stay in Vegas.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.834
Sorry.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.117
Definitely love the Vegas.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.039
How was Vegas?

39:31.440 --> 39:33.431
Definitely a spectacle.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.397
How were the strippers?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.629
- Surprisingly tame, actually.
- That's good.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.318
Considering what happened next.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.917
- Do I want to know?
- Depends.

39:45.120 --> 39:48.430
- What is it?
- On how you feel about drunken catfights.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.353
Julie and Hailey?

39:50.520 --> 39:53.557
Wow. Even Vegas can't compete
with that.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.594
So how did it go with my dad?

39:57.360 --> 40:01.273
Well, you'll be relieved to know
I did not punch him in the mouth.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.714
That is a relief.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.633
Jimmy did.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.952
I don't think we'll be invited back
to the Hard Rock. But you know what?

40:09.120 --> 40:11.714
I'm not really looking forward
to getting back to Vegas.

40:11.880 --> 40:16.590
- I thought you loved the Vegas.
- I do. I do love the Vegas.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.639
Because afterwards,
it is so nice to come home.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.791
- Hi.
- You told my dad?

40:32.320 --> 40:35.039
Your dad found out. He asked me.
I had to tell him the truth.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.475
Oh, so you'll tell my dad the truth,
but you won't tell me?

40:37.640 --> 40:39.119
What are you talking about?

40:40.840 --> 40:44.071
You know what,
maybe you should just ask Theresa.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.591
Just tell me what's going on, okay?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.593
Theresa's pregnant.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.155
And it might not be Eddie's.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.357
So why don't you tell me
what's going on?
