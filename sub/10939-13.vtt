Previously on 'Heartland':

00:04.037 --> 00:06.473
l just set it up so you
could practice jumping here.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.674
lt's amazing.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.010
l saw your name on the entry list
for the Fall Finale.

00:10.110 --> 00:10.943
l didn't think you'd have the points.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.713
Well, l don't yet,
but l entered in the Hudson show.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.816
l got an e-mail from that investment
company in New York,

00:16.916 --> 00:18.385
and they want to bring me in
for an interview.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.953
[ Sighs ]...

00:20.053 --> 00:21.588
Who's coaching you?
- Me.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.790
Come on, Ty, you can barely
stay on a horse, man.

00:23.890 --> 00:24.524
l guess that's what happens...

00:24.624 --> 00:26.693
...when an older man tries to do
a younger man's job.

00:26.793 --> 00:31.128
Like gather around cattle.
Or trying to be a father.

00:32.098 --> 00:36.008
l am going to that interview.
- And you should.

Only one competitor left.
You know who.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.049
Okay, remember to keep
your hands quiet, all right?

- Not bad. Not bad.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.485
Thanks, Coach.

02:32.585 --> 02:33.820
That was amazing.

Are you riding in the Fall Finale?

Great. Maybe l'll see you there.

You too.

Oh, Mallory.

Looks like you got yourself a cowboy.

Just shut up.
- VAL: Well, it's not good enough.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.720
This jumper costs $1 00 grand,
and you barely placed.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.756
How do you think
that makes Briar Ridge look?

03:09.856 --> 03:13.593
Like a third-rate trail riding center.
That's what. Well, that's it, Ashley.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.863
l am not spending another dime
on horses or fancy trainers...

When does she get back from New York?

Uh, her interview is tomorrow.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.124
She should be back
a couple of days after that.

04:18.224 --> 04:22.462
What if she stays? My mom
bet me five dollars she would.

04:22.562 --> 04:26.132
Did your boyfriend call you yet?
- Shut up.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.935
Are you expecting someone,
Grandpa?

Oh, no. No. Just looks
like some weather coming in, is all.

l hope not. l've gotta practice
before school tomorrow.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.845
Well, not if it's all iced up
and slippery, you're not.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.880
Well, then, l'll sand it tonight.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.983
l've got no other place to practice, Grandpa.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.919
How about it, Coach?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.249
l'll help.
- Me too.

'l'm not expecting anyone.'

JACK: Just some weather blowing in.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.234
Some fine looking weather, l'd say.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.303
Just clear the way, will ya? Just...

05:03.403 --> 05:05.238
Hi, Lisa.
- Hello, everyone.

Hello. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

05:09.175 --> 05:12.378
Hey. Ben told me you placed
really well today. Congratulations.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.776
Thank you.
- Good for you.

Do l smell coffee?
- Yes, you do.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.346
Good. Bye, Amy.
- Bye.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.623
What? We're gonna watch
the hockey game.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.959
Hmm-mm.
- Unless there's any objections?

05:26.059 --> 05:29.295
They're so cute at that age.
- lt's so gross.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.730
Aw, come on. Give Jack a break.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.098
He's just celebrating.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.700
He's pretty proud of you today, Amy.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.169
Everybody in the stands knew
you were his granddaughter.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.971
Great.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.106
You know, it was actually pretty exciting.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.242
You know, l was into it.
lt's like any sport, right?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.744
You need a game plan.
- A game plan?

05:44.844 --> 05:47.447
Yeah. Putting you on a training schedule.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.314
[ Sighs ]...

05:48.414 --> 05:50.283
...l'm not going all hard core.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.552
Listen to your coach.
You gotta beat Ashley.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.720
We've only got a week left.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.923
Would you guys just calm down?
l mean, it's just a horse show.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.826
The Fall Finale isn't just any horse show.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.295
Okay, well, l'm totally happy
with my second place today.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.896
Right. That's like saying
you're totally happy...

06:03.996 --> 06:06.716
...that your dad didn't show up.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.367
He was probably busy.

06:25.952 --> 06:26.719
So, what do you think?

06:26.819 --> 06:30.049
Hey, you beat your personal best time.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.625
And l think your only
real competition is Amy.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.826
Oh, give me a break.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.695
She might place
in a small town nothing show,

06:35.795 --> 06:38.264
but Amy doesn't stand a chance
at the Fall Finale.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.233
l don't know.
Don't underestimate her.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.333
VAL: Or her horse.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.079
She already beat you once.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.874
We don't want a repeat of that,
do we?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.974
Take him around again.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.153
You see?

07:00.253 --> 07:04.524
That's the problem right there.
The horse is inconsistent.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.860
l'm telling you right now, if he
doesn't improve, l'm selling him.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.164
You can't just sell him.
Apollo belongs to me.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.732
Oh, really?

07:12.832 --> 07:13.966
Hmph.

07:14.066 --> 07:19.561
Who paid for him, sweetheart?
Apollo belongs to Briar Ridge.

07:20.706 --> 07:24.544
No way. l will not ask Amy for help.
Have you lost your mind?

07:24.644 --> 07:27.109
Your mom's right.
- Excuse me?

07:27.113 --> 07:30.850
Apollo. He's inconsistent, Ashley.
Something's getting to him.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.220
And Amy's pretty good
at figuring stuff like that out.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.089
l mean, it's kinda spooky how good she is.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.569
Oh, my God, Ben.
Don't start.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.827
Look, l'm not asking Amy for help.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.927

07:53.239 --> 07:56.008
l'm glad you're taking
that coaching thing seriously,

07:56.108 --> 08:00.704

l pay you for.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.949
We're gonna be buried in snow
before we know it.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.917

Oh, and, um, Clint Riley's coming
at the end of the week.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.594
So, don't do another disappearing act.

l won't. l'd like to, but l won't.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.745
You're not worried, are you?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.636
Well, don't be.

08:23.736 --> 08:27.373
l'm sure you're not what Clint
would call a 'threat to society'.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.908
Thanks.

08:29.008 --> 08:33.240
And, uh, l'll vouch for you.
You know that.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.739

lt looks like a rat's nest.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.785
So, how did the interview go?

09:16.956 --> 09:21.154
Well, that's good.
When are you coming home?

09:21.294 --> 09:27.563
Okay. Yeah. You have a safe trip.
We'll see you soon. Bye.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.092
That's Lou. lt went okay.

09:31.270 --> 09:35.208
The interview. She thought they
were suitably impressed.

09:35.308 --> 09:39.039
That's great.
- Yeah. Yeah. Good for her.

09:41.781 --> 09:46.352
Look, Amy. We can't stop Lou
from doing what she wants to do.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.454
lf she wants to work
in New York again, well,

09:48.554 --> 09:50.923
there's not much we can say about that.

09:51.023 --> 09:56.293
l know. lt just, l don't know,
it feels weird without her here.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.430
l am so hungry.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.966
l would probably fall on the side
of the road and freeze to death...

10:00.066 --> 10:01.667
...if l tried to walk home now.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.336
l mean, my mom's on one
of her crazy diets.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.939
We have no food in our fridge.
Do you guys have any cheese?

10:07.039 --> 10:10.099
Nice to see you, Mallory.
Come on in.

Look who's here.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.254
Hey.

10:24.557 --> 10:28.254
Okay. l need your help.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.432
But why me? l mean, what
about your 'world class' coaches?

10:33.532 --> 10:37.203
They were useless, so l fired them.
Just say yes.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.704
Well, l'm gonna have to think about it.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.108
Um, no. l mean, come on,
isn't that what you do?

10:42.208 --> 10:43.743
What you're always going on about?

10:43.843 --> 10:47.980
About you having this, whatever, gift
with problem horses.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.160
Okay, but, Ashley...
- Look, l'll pay you. A lot.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.184
How much?

10:55.521 --> 10:56.956
lt's not about the money.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.324
Okay, your horse doesn't have a problem.

10:58.424 --> 11:02.628
lt's not troubled. lt's not abused.
- That's a matter of opinion.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.897
Apollo definitely has a problem.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.234
Look, you've seen him. lt's like
he freezes. And l don't know why.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.835
Yeah, well, neither do l.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.935
Amy, please.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.472
Look, if l don't do well at the Finale,

11:13.572 --> 11:16.642
my mom's gonna sell Apollo,
and, l can't let her do that...

11:16.742 --> 11:21.247
...because it's the only horse
l've ever had a real connection with.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.680
Please. l need your help.

11:25.217 --> 11:30.289
lf l could, l'd help, but l just
physically don't have the time.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.279
She's busy training her own horse.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.960
Well, that'll be a bit hard,
considering...

11:40.566 --> 11:41.934
Considering what?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.837
Well, considering that if you don't help me,

11:44.937 --> 11:49.208
Ben is gonna come over here
and take his jumps back to Fairfield.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.538

11:54.680 --> 11:56.910
Think about it.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.790
Are you kidding?
Ashley asked you to help her?

12:04.890 --> 12:08.494
Yeah, and if l don't, she's gonna get
Ben to take away all his jumps.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.997

12:12.164 --> 12:14.800
...l don't know if l can do it.
- Well, of course you can't do it.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.069
Like you're gonna help the enemy?

12:17.169 --> 12:20.006
How would you feel if you fixed
Apollo and then Ashley won?

12:20.106 --> 12:21.407
Like crap.

12:21.507 --> 12:25.111
Yeah. So, l'm your coach,
and l say you don't do it.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.214
Great, and then Ashley's gonna
get Ben to take away his jumps,

12:28.314 --> 12:31.629
and you'll have nothing to coach me on.

12:35.121 --> 12:38.057
You know what, Amy?
Do what you want, okay?

12:38.157 --> 12:42.322
lt obviously doesn't matter
how hard we've worked.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.331
What's his problem?

12:45.431 --> 12:49.681
He's right. There's no way
you need to help Ashley.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.121
You don't need anybody's help.
l mean, you're looking great.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.890
Your horse is totally with you.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.125
So, why does he do
what he does sometimes?

13:13.225 --> 13:15.428
l don't know.
Maybe he just has an off day.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.230
l wouldn't worry about it.
- You think?

13:18.330 --> 13:20.032
l do.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.293
Amy, thanks. Really.

VAL: How lovely to see you.

13:31.410 --> 13:35.915
Listen, before you go running off,
l want you to watch something.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.717
Take him around again, Ashley.

- Humor me.

She's doing something wrong.
- l'm not.

14:25.264 --> 14:28.400
Ashley, the horse is not performing.
Figure it out.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
lt's not the horse.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.266
What is it, then?
- lt's you.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.377
Oh, of course it is.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.546
No, what l mean
is when you're watching Ashley,

14:40.646 --> 14:43.115
the whole dynamic
between her and Apollo changes.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.084
Well, l'm not doing anything.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.920
When you sense that your mother's
watching you, you tense up.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.222
You clench the reins tighter.
You dig your knees in.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.492
l mean, you probably don't realize
you're doing it, but you are.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.930
You're just telegraphing your fear
to Apollo, and so he tenses up too.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.198
That's ridiculous.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.667
l've been watching Ashley ride
since she could get on a horse.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.767
Just listen.

15:07.673 --> 15:13.543
All right, l'm listening.
What do we do?

15:13.646 --> 15:17.316
Well, if you want your daughter
to win any ribbons,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.249
you shouldn't be in the arena.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.819
Maybe you shouldn't be either.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.863
Thank you.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.066
l would've never had the guts
to say those things to my mother.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.401
No problem.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.337
But, ah, don't think l'll be
doing you any favors.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.840
Because when l'm at that course
at the Fall Finale,

15:40.940 --> 15:43.067
...l'll be there to win.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.175
So will l.

- You okay?

15:59.024 --> 16:03.662
Yeah, uh, l just have this
probation thing coming up. So...

16:03.762 --> 16:06.999
...l'm kinda stressed out.
- lt's the last one, right?

16:07.099 --> 16:10.626
No worries.
- Yeah, l guess.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.781
Are you still mad at me?

16:17.843 --> 16:21.580
No. Mallory told me you went
to Briar Ridge today.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.115
What was the problem?

16:23.215 --> 16:25.410
Well, it was kinda weird.

16:25.517 --> 16:30.789
Apollo was totally fine one minute
and then really tense the next.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.858
Sorta like someone l know.

16:32.958 --> 16:33.959

16:34.059 --> 16:37.429

You figured it out. Right?

16:37.529 --> 16:39.598
So, did Ashley give you
a big fat thank you?

16:39.698 --> 16:43.802
No. She told me she's gonna
beat my ass at the Fall Finale.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.104
What am l gonna do with you?

16:45.204 --> 16:48.374
Hey, at least now we have Ben's
jumps to practice on. Right?

16:48.474 --> 16:52.278
Practice? Oh, yeah. Weren't we
supposed to practice today?

16:52.378 --> 16:55.114
Oh, no, wait. You were too busy
coaching our competition.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.382
Ty.

16:56.482 --> 16:59.551
We have jumps to test out, Amy.
Timings to do.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.754
Look at you.
Your face is all red.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.589
You completely ignore my schedule.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.924
You don't care about my training program,

17:05.023 --> 17:06.191
about my jump configurations.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.660
lt looks like a pretzel.

You are so annoying.
You never listen to me.

Okay. Yeah.
l'm gonna do my homework.

17:36.922 --> 17:42.277

you can time my jumps. Okay?

Floor to ceiling windows
overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.618
l don't think l made a total fool of myself.

18:06.718 --> 18:10.456
And... Oh, the hotel. lt had a spa.
l had a massage and a facial.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.257
Agh, l forgot how the big city feels.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.059

there's just so much energy.

So much noise. l love the noise.

Well, good. When are you gonna
hear back from them?

to pick me up from the airport.

That was your mother's.
lt was her school ring.

She gave it to me when l was
on the circuit for good luck.
