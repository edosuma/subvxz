00:08.878 --> 00:13.479
[Man:] <i>I've always been amazed at how much
this place changes from season to season.</i>

00:13.696 --> 00:17.710
<i>For the first 13 years of my
life, winter wasn't my favorite.</i>

00:18.572 --> 00:20.752
<i>Oh, sure, I loved Christmas like any kid,</i>

00:20.753 --> 00:23.427
<i>but I remember being told
in Sunday school class once</i>

00:23.428 --> 00:27.045
<i>that they didn't know exactly
what month the birth really happened.</i>

00:27.571 --> 00:30.013
<i>So I always had a sense
they had just placed it in December</i>

00:30.014 --> 00:34.420
<i>as some kind gesture to help
break up those long, cold months.</i>

00:36.682 --> 00:40.103
<i>Ten years ago, my attitude
toward winter changed.</i>

00:41.888 --> 00:45.941
<i>I guess some don't always know
when as a boy they became a man,</i>

00:46.541 --> 00:49.806
<i>but for me, I know exactly when.</i>

00:51.119 --> 00:53.868
<i>It was that December,
10 years ago.</i>

00:57.496 --> 01:01.323
<i>It was the end of the most
defining six months of my life.</i>

01:02.148 --> 01:05.355
<i>And it was also when I met
my best friend.</i>

01:11.978 --> 01:13.873
<i>It was a trying time.</i>

01:13.874 --> 01:18.084
<i>Grandma and Grandpa and I
had already had Thanksgiving-- alone.</i>

01:18.085 --> 01:21.973
<i>It sure didn't feel like the same holiday
we'd shared so many times before.</i>

01:22.445 --> 01:24.873
<i>My mother and my sisters
hadn't been there, because</i>

01:24.897 --> 01:27.020
<i>they were coming for
Christmas a month later;</i>

01:27.021 --> 01:30.547
<i>two long trips
within 30 days wasn't practical.</i>

01:31.875 --> 01:33.883
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Hey.

01:33.884 --> 01:36.491
- Hello, handsome.
[Kiss]

01:36.876 --> 01:40.753
[Man:] <i>Everything in that old
farmhouse had changed in June,</i>

01:40.754 --> 01:43.535
<i>the day when my dad died
in a farm accident.</i>

01:43.536 --> 01:45.998
<i>A freak accident, everyone said.</i>

01:45.999 --> 01:49.880
<i>No way to prevent it
or see it coming, they said.</i>

01:49.881 --> 01:52.641
<i>It affected us each
in our own way.</i>

01:53.118 --> 01:56.302
<i>Grandpa showed little,
brought everything inside.</i>

01:56.303 --> 01:59.868
<i>Grandma tried to make things
as all right as she could for everyone else.</i>

01:59.869 --> 02:04.378
<i>Me, I just tried to do what I thought
my dad would have wanted me to do.</i>

02:05.585 --> 02:07.916
Frank Thorne got arrested.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.342
- Drunk driving again.
- Oh.

02:10.699 --> 02:13.236
Yeah, he's going to jail this time.

02:13.237 --> 02:16.211
- [Grandpa speaking quietly]
- You did what?

02:16.524 --> 02:18.410
Cora, this'll work out.

02:18.811 --> 02:19.865
I'm fine with it.

02:19.866 --> 02:23.395
I mean, I've always been fine
with it, but are you sure?

02:23.396 --> 02:27.233
I stopped being sure
of anything on June 15th.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.328
I brought home a dog.

02:33.563 --> 02:34.835
We got a puppy?

02:34.836 --> 02:37.159
It's not what you think,
George, so don't get excited.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.681
It's not a puppy,
and you don't get to keep him.

02:40.897 --> 02:42.860
It's Frank Thorne's dog.

02:42.861 --> 02:45.132
Thorne has to leave his farm
for a little while.

02:45.133 --> 02:47.268
You mean, the one he keeps
in front of his house?

02:47.269 --> 02:49.754
The one that barks like crazy
every time my school bus goes by?

02:49.755 --> 02:50.966
- That's the one.

02:50.967 --> 02:53.147
Well, he's our neighbour,
and your grandpa told him

02:53.148 --> 02:55.703
we'd help him out and take care
of his dog while he's gone.

02:55.704 --> 02:58.565
But you always said
dogs and dairy cattle don't mix.

02:58.566 --> 03:01.637
Well, somebody needed
our help. We'll make it work.

03:01.989 --> 03:04.109
Dog is in the pickup.

03:07.328 --> 03:09.023
[Bark]

03:12.097 --> 03:13.407
Hey, boy.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.105
[Barking]

03:18.106 --> 03:19.108
Let's go, let's go.

03:19.109 --> 03:21.019
Hi! Hi!

03:21.020 --> 03:23.386
- Come on up.
- Dog seems to like him.

03:35.657 --> 03:37.211
Whoa.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.531
[Laughing]

03:46.314 --> 03:47.767
[Bark]

03:47.768 --> 03:50.199
I have a fraction of
the energy either of them have.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.767
That a boy.

03:54.721 --> 03:56.095
What's his name?

03:56.482 --> 03:58.220
Darned if I know.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.779
[Barking]
[Laughing]

04:07.264 --> 04:09.646
[George:] Good boy.

04:11.549 --> 04:13.690
[Barking]

04:15.962 --> 04:20.149
[Grandpa:] Maybe his mom'll let him have a dog
once he gets to Minnesota.

04:20.404 --> 04:24.808
[Grandma:] He told me the other day
he wasn't sure he wanted to go to Minnesota.

04:25.066 --> 04:26.227
[George:] All right,
all right.

04:26.228 --> 04:28.691
[Man:] <i>My mom moved to Minnesota in August,</i>

04:28.692 --> 04:31.156
<i>closer to my sisters in college.</i>

04:31.157 --> 04:34.723
<i>It was as if she couldn't be
around the farm without Dad here--</i>

04:34.724 --> 04:37.026
<i>Too much to remind her of him.</i>

04:37.361 --> 04:42.194
<i>I had asked her if I could stay
in Kansas a little longer, till Christmas.</i>

04:42.613 --> 04:44.870
<i>I hadn't been ready
to leave yet.</i>

04:45.371 --> 04:47.470
<i>Reluctantly, she'd agreed.</i>

04:47.803 --> 04:51.673
OK, all right, you win.
You can stay.

04:55.748 --> 04:57.702
Dinner's almost ready.

04:57.703 --> 05:00.550
Grandma made a bed for him
in the mud room.

05:01.517 --> 05:03.781
Grandpa, do you think
the dog will be here for Christmas?

05:03.783 --> 05:05.364
I'm not sure.

05:06.518 --> 05:08.660
I think Mom would like him.

05:08.661 --> 05:10.260
Yeah.

05:12.242 --> 05:15.074
They're saying it could turn cold tonight.

05:15.075 --> 05:18.400
Feels like, uh,
we could get some more snow.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.888
I've always said
you missed your true calling.

05:20.889 --> 05:23.256
That knee of yours predicts
bad weather better

05:23.281 --> 05:25.793
than anything or anybody
I've ever seen on TV.

05:26.074 --> 05:27.854
Yeah, well,
I could have been one of those

05:28.044 --> 05:31.741
slick TV weathermen, you know,
working five minutes a day.

05:33.693 --> 05:38.098
George, if we do get any
measurable amount of snow,

05:38.099 --> 05:40.617
I'm gonna need you to help
with the morning milking,

05:40.618 --> 05:43.857
so I can clear off the roads
with the snowplow.

05:44.003 --> 05:46.140
- Before school?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.045 --> 05:48.611
That's early.

05:48.612 --> 05:52.454
The county pays us to have those
roads cleared as soon as possible.

05:52.455 --> 05:55.136
You can't wait till the middle
of the day to get started.

05:55.242 --> 05:57.459
Besides, getting up early
is good for you.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.795
You know, I've been doing it,
hey, for 60 years,

05:59.797 --> 06:02.473
and your dad did it
when he was your age.

06:03.431 --> 06:08.480
And these snow days aren't gonna happen
more than 40 or 50 times this winter.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.559
George, do you want
to feed Thorne's dog?

06:16.560 --> 06:19.218
He must be hungry
after all that running around.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.320
- Mmm.
- [Chuckling]

06:25.654 --> 06:27.002
[Grandma chuckling]

06:27.003 --> 06:29.177
Looks like
he's all tuckered out.

06:29.179 --> 06:32.665
I don't think he got to do much
playing over at Thorne's place.

06:33.042 --> 06:36.750
Grandma, what time will I have to get up
to finish all the milking before school?

06:36.751 --> 06:38.264
Early.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.552
I'll help you.

06:39.553 --> 06:42.137
I used to help your dad
till he got used to it.

06:42.138 --> 06:46.131
- Who'll do it when I move to Minnesota?
- Oh, we'll work something out.

06:46.132 --> 06:48.117
That's not your concern.

06:51.121 --> 06:55.497
Grandma, do you think Thorne's dog
could maybe sleep in my room tonight?

06:55.856 --> 06:58.158
You wouldn't even know
he was there.

06:58.523 --> 07:00.494
Ah... I think
we could do that.

07:00.824 --> 07:02.509
On two conditions:

07:02.510 --> 07:06.008
one, that you and your grandpa
give him a bath first.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.960
- I can do that.
- And two, we give him a name.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.950
We can't keep
calling him "Thorne's dog".

07:13.082 --> 07:16.932
Well... you said he was
all tuckered out.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.536
I think his name should be Tucker.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.711
Ha! Ha! Ha! I like that!

07:21.286 --> 07:23.315
Well, there you go, Tucker.

07:23.316 --> 07:26.418
Not only do you have a new name,
you've got a new place to sleep.

07:26.419 --> 07:29.219
It's a big day.
Don't mess it up.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.459
[Growl]
[Bark]

07:31.836 --> 07:34.391
[Panting]
[Sneeze]

07:34.976 --> 07:37.207
When you brought Tucker home...

07:38.808 --> 07:41.749
...I couldn't help but think
about when John was little.

07:42.722 --> 07:44.422
All those years
of him wanting a dog,

07:44.423 --> 07:47.334
and you being so stubborn
about him not having one.

07:47.787 --> 07:50.109
And now you bring one home.

07:50.619 --> 07:53.106
The dog needed a place to go.

07:53.961 --> 07:56.572
I thought it might do George some good.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.110
George has to go to Minnesota, and...

08:01.086 --> 08:04.284
Tucker will go back to Thorne
once he's out of jail.

08:05.402 --> 08:10.513
I hope it's just not one more thing
for George to miss when it's gone.

08:11.411 --> 08:13.374
Yeah, he's a good boy.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.502
This house is gonna get
pretty quiet when he's gone.

08:19.675 --> 08:21.369
Yeah.

08:23.195 --> 08:24.830
[Sigh]

08:24.980 --> 08:26.962
We're gonna miss him.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.159
Yeah.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.513
[Whining]

08:48.964 --> 08:50.914
All right, come on.

08:58.607 --> 09:01.068
As long as you're down
before Grandma gets up.

09:10.003 --> 09:11.666
Wake up, McCray!

09:11.667 --> 09:13.170
We're almost there.

09:14.468 --> 09:16.857
- Almost where?
- Uh, school.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.320
That's where the school bus
usually takes us.

09:20.350 --> 09:22.987
Oh, I slept the whole way?

09:23.765 --> 09:25.549
I was up milking cows at 4:30.

09:25.550 --> 09:29.154
Yeah, I was talking to you for 15 minutes
before I knew you were asleep.

09:29.155 --> 09:31.423
Oh, did you say
anything interesting?

09:31.426 --> 09:33.440
You'll never know.

09:33.987 --> 09:37.140
So, when are you going
to see Mrs. Weeks?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.486
- About what?
- The school play.

09:39.487 --> 09:41.613
She picked you to play Santa.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.883
- What?
- She's posting it today.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.769
I got a sneak peak at the list.

09:46.139 --> 09:48.057
Well, I didn't try out.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.724
Yeah, well, that never stops Mrs. Weeks.

09:50.725 --> 09:53.781
Better start working
on your "ho, ho, ho", McCray.

10:02.442 --> 10:04.696
[Door closing]
- I knew it.

10:04.997 --> 10:07.737
I could smell your cookies from
halfway down the road. - [She laughs]

10:07.762 --> 10:11.613
Well, no one can say the McCray men don't
have a highly developed sense of smell.

10:11.614 --> 10:15.388
I was way out in the machine shed
when I first smelled them.

10:15.389 --> 10:16.648
[Growling]

10:16.694 --> 10:19.787
Ah, ah, ah. And I don't care
how much he begs you.

10:19.788 --> 10:23.795
Don't be giving him any.
He's already had about half a dozen.

10:23.796 --> 10:25.287
[Phone ringing]

10:26.974 --> 10:28.318
Hello?

10:28.688 --> 10:30.351
Hi, Mom.

10:31.907 --> 10:34.352
I've got some laundry
to put away.

10:36.264 --> 10:39.005
Yeah. Yeah, I've been
missing you too.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.635
I still feel bad that I wasn't
there for Thanksgiving.

10:41.636 --> 10:43.374
It was tough to be away from you.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.214
Grandma and Grandpa tried
to make it as good as they could.

10:46.610 --> 10:50.259
But... it still wasn't the same
without everybody here,

10:51.436 --> 10:54.063
- and Dad.
- I know, honey.

10:55.894 --> 10:58.992
- I miss him a lot.
- I miss him too.

11:01.139 --> 11:03.859
<i>We're looking forward
to being with you at Christmas.</i>

11:03.860 --> 11:06.698
<i>And I can't wait
to bring you home with me.</i>

11:09.587 --> 11:11.014
<i>Honey?</i>

11:12.250 --> 11:14.648
- Are you all right?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

11:14.843 --> 11:16.761
<i>Just a little tired.</i>

11:18.843 --> 11:21.060
It's good that I stayed here, though.

11:21.061 --> 11:23.354
Grandma and Grandpa
need me right now.

11:23.355 --> 11:27.796
Well, I bet they're glad to have
you helping, but I sure miss you.

11:27.797 --> 11:32.419
Oh, and, uh, Mom, I have a dog
to take care of now.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.428
His name's Tucker.

11:34.429 --> 11:37.538
- Grandma and Grandpa got you a dog?
- Not exactly.

11:37.972 --> 11:40.540
He belongs to Frank Thorne, but...

11:40.541 --> 11:44.077
Frank's in jail right now,
so I'm taking care of him till he gets out.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.820
Oh, well, I-I'm sorry
to hear that about Frank.

11:46.821 --> 11:48.291
That's too bad.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.371
Yeah.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.035
He's got a nice dog, though.

11:52.036 --> 11:54.732
- The one that always barked?
- Yeah, but...

11:54.733 --> 11:57.235
he doesn't seem to
bark too much here.

11:57.236 --> 11:59.917
I think he just wanted
someone to talk to.

11:59.918 --> 12:03.656
He's a great dog.
I just never knew it before.

12:04.928 --> 12:07.641
Anyway, I better make sure
the chickens get watered.

12:07.642 --> 12:09.281
- OK, sweetheart.

12:09.851 --> 12:13.874
Well, your sisters and I love you,
and we cannot wait for Christmas.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.373
Love you too, Mom.

12:15.630 --> 12:17.066
- <i>Bye.</i>

12:24.173 --> 12:26.274
[Barking]

12:29.138 --> 12:30.140
[Growling]

12:30.141 --> 12:31.474
Lie down.

12:31.888 --> 12:33.302
On your side.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.063
Sit up.

12:35.851 --> 12:37.288
Feet.

12:40.556 --> 12:42.843
- Hey, Tucker.
- [Whining]

12:42.844 --> 12:44.570
What's this?

12:50.940 --> 12:52.191
[Bark]

12:52.192 --> 12:53.434
Whoa.

12:55.473 --> 12:57.219
Go get Grandma.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.897
Go get Grandma.

12:58.898 --> 13:01.390
- [Bark]
- Oh, what a good boy.

13:01.391 --> 13:04.909
What a good boy.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Who's that?

13:05.153 --> 13:06.695
- Huh.
- Well.

13:07.843 --> 13:09.805
Good job, Tucker.

13:15.663 --> 13:17.268
Got it.

13:20.969 --> 13:22.476
Jigsaw puzzle.

13:22.477 --> 13:23.644
See the picture?

13:23.645 --> 13:25.532
It's of our farm.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.960
Jerry Jensen took it from his crop duster,
so you can see the whole thing.

13:29.961 --> 13:31.399
It's a family tradition.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.707
We always put it together at Christmas,
so I figured it was time to-- [Yelp]

13:51.704 --> 13:53.975
[Whining]

13:55.098 --> 13:56.699
[Cora:] George.

13:57.673 --> 13:59.885
Just a second, Grandma.

14:05.161 --> 14:07.625
- I found the puzzle.
- Wonderful.

14:07.626 --> 14:09.161
Listen, why don't you
put it on the table?

14:09.162 --> 14:10.584
We need to go.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.745
Go where?

14:14.714 --> 14:16.055
Are you about done here?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.447
Yep, yep.

14:17.448 --> 14:19.642
No, it definitely needs work.

14:19.643 --> 14:23.337
Oh. But I... I think it can be
spruced up, hmm? - Mmhmm.

14:23.652 --> 14:25.474
Looking good, McCray.

14:25.704 --> 14:27.712
Oh, hello, Mary Ann.
How are you?

14:27.713 --> 14:30.148
Better now that I've seen Santa.

14:30.151 --> 14:32.960
- Are you in the play too?
- I'm a star.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.774
I'm not 'the' star.
I play a star.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.655
George is actually the star.

14:38.457 --> 14:40.230
I got him his role.

14:41.604 --> 14:44.774
I told Mrs. Weeks that he meant to
try out for Santa but he forgot.

14:45.111 --> 14:46.496
You what?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.006
His eyes, how they twinkle,

14:49.007 --> 14:51.097
his dimples, how merry.

14:51.352 --> 14:53.015
Typecasting, really.

14:54.596 --> 14:56.866
[Cora and Mary Ann laughing]

14:57.734 --> 15:00.334
I've never seen him when he's
not barking at the school bus.

15:00.343 --> 15:01.845
[Laughing]

15:02.898 --> 15:05.297
He's much friendlier
than I would have guessed.

15:11.282 --> 15:13.775
My dad said
Thorne got out of jail today.

15:14.129 --> 15:15.574
Really?

15:15.575 --> 15:17.089
[Santa:] Ho, ho, ho!

15:17.090 --> 15:18.631
[Cora:] Bye.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.029
Oh, hey, Grandma.
Let me get those.

15:23.030 --> 15:25.908
Oh, thank you, George.
Such a gentleman.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.263
I'd better get home.

15:27.264 --> 15:29.271
Bye, Mrs. McCray.
Bye, George.

15:29.272 --> 15:30.350
Bye, Tucker.

15:30.351 --> 15:33.078
- Bye. See you tomorrow.

15:33.512 --> 15:36.066
Her dad told her
that Thorne is out of jail.

15:37.093 --> 15:39.715
- Oh.
- Do we have to give him back?

15:41.490 --> 15:43.471
[Santa:] Ho, ho, ho!

15:47.747 --> 15:50.857
Tuck, you ever read Shakespeare?
[Whine]

15:50.858 --> 15:53.156
My dad told me
it's not that bad--

15:53.157 --> 15:55.843
well, once you figure out
what's going on.

15:56.170 --> 16:00.389
But sometimes it's about as
clear as you barking something.

16:01.005 --> 16:03.244
Ha! You would have liked my dad.

16:04.286 --> 16:06.187
And he would have liked you.

16:06.595 --> 16:11.008
He told me he always wanted a dog
but never actually got one.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.272
Well, Dad,

16:21.273 --> 16:23.575
at least I had a dog
for a little while.

16:27.140 --> 16:28.974
I miss you, Dad.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.974
Sometimes I try to
stop being sad, but I can't.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.436
Being with Tucker helps,
but now he's going away too.

16:39.134 --> 16:41.833
Maybe I shouldn't have even
gotten to know him.

16:43.195 --> 16:44.835
But I did.

16:46.499 --> 16:49.316
And now if I move back
to Minnesota,

16:49.317 --> 16:51.298
I might not ever see him again.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.876
But I also miss Mom.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.421
I just know,
if I could talk to you,

17:02.423 --> 17:05.117
you'd help figure this all out.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.460
What's it like
up where you are, Dad?

17:10.461 --> 17:12.922
Are there... dogs in heaven?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.348
I hope so,

17:16.349 --> 17:19.249
'cause then someday
you can meet Tucker.

17:21.212 --> 17:23.352
And we'd all be together again.

17:24.231 --> 17:26.457
[Knocking on door]
- George.

17:27.092 --> 17:29.454
Frank's here for Tucker.

17:31.829 --> 17:33.812
OK, Tuck.

17:35.405 --> 17:37.029
[Sigh]

17:37.030 --> 17:38.722
It's time to go.

17:42.751 --> 17:44.733
Thanks for being my friend.

17:47.154 --> 17:49.360
[Tucker whining quietly]

17:52.433 --> 17:55.542
Phil was kind enough
to give me a lift over here.

17:55.977 --> 17:58.389
I sort of don't have
a driver's licence right now.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.217
Well, we could have
driven over to your place.

18:00.218 --> 18:03.062
No, uh, it's no problem.

18:03.063 --> 18:05.272
Needed to get some things in town too.

18:05.273 --> 18:09.078
Anyway, thanks
for looking after my dog.

18:09.378 --> 18:13.304
Well, you're welcome. We've kinda
gotten used to having Tucker around.

18:14.054 --> 18:15.745
Come on, dog.

18:20.357 --> 18:21.359
[Whine]

18:21.360 --> 18:23.130
Come on, dog.

18:28.869 --> 18:30.311
Come on!

18:39.084 --> 18:42.509
[Tucker whining]
[Barking]

18:47.426 --> 18:50.017
You did a good job
with Tucker, George.

18:51.499 --> 18:53.481
[Tucker barking]

19:01.586 --> 19:03.308
Don't worry, Tuck.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.054
I'll get you back.

19:05.055 --> 19:07.037
You belong here.

19:10.042 --> 19:11.910
Hey, buddy.

19:13.017 --> 19:14.714
How are ya?

19:14.715 --> 19:15.715
Hi.

19:17.682 --> 19:19.725
[George laughing]

19:19.726 --> 19:22.243
Come on. Let's go.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.456
[George laughing]

19:30.238 --> 19:32.125
Something you need?

19:32.147 --> 19:35.855
Um, I wanted to talk to you
about Tuck-- about your dog.

19:36.405 --> 19:37.960
What about him?

19:38.361 --> 19:40.676
Well, I noticed that most
of the time--

19:40.677 --> 19:44.417
at least when I come by--
he's out here all alone.

19:44.944 --> 19:49.133
Um, so I was thinking I could
maybe help you out and...

19:49.134 --> 19:50.939
take him off your hands.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.971
Then you wouldn't have
to worry about him.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.264
You saying you want
me to give you my dog?

19:55.265 --> 19:56.461
I'd be good to him.

19:56.462 --> 20:00.524
We got along really well when he stayed
at my house while you were... away.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.487
Answer's no, you can't have him.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.778
[Tucker whining]

20:15.326 --> 20:16.892
Good morning, McCray.

20:16.893 --> 20:18.322
Hi.

20:18.323 --> 20:21.522
Actually, do you mind if I call you Nick,
at least until Christmas?

20:21.523 --> 20:23.372
St. Nick?

20:23.373 --> 20:26.099
Maybe you should practice your lines
when you're milking the cows.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.411
I heard somebody say that classical music
actually helps cows produce more milk.

20:29.412 --> 20:31.509
Maybe a classical
theatrical piece like

20:31.533 --> 20:33.795
'Santa and the Snowmen'
would do the same thing.

20:33.796 --> 20:37.273
You sure talk a lot
for this early in the morning.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.740
[Tucker barking]

20:40.508 --> 20:42.434
[Barking]

20:43.970 --> 20:45.520
I'm sorry, George.

20:45.521 --> 20:48.285
I guess I was just hoping
it wasn't true.

20:51.132 --> 20:52.960
Thanks.

20:52.961 --> 20:56.744
I mean, why does he even have a dog if he's
just gonna keep it penned up all the time?

20:56.745 --> 20:58.549
Yeah, I know, right?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.693
That's kind of what I said
to Thorne.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.385
You did?

21:03.038 --> 21:06.072
Yeah, I offered to take Tucker
off his hands permanently.

21:06.073 --> 21:09.336
McCray, I'm impressed
that you would do such a thing.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.378
Well, don't be too impressed.

21:11.379 --> 21:12.759
He turned me down.

21:13.978 --> 21:16.920
OK, well, what did you offer him?

21:17.551 --> 21:18.631
What do you mean?

21:18.632 --> 21:21.937
I mean, how much
did you say you'd pay him?

21:22.470 --> 21:24.114
Well, I didn't.

21:24.115 --> 21:26.481
He's not just gonna
give you the dog.

21:26.483 --> 21:28.467
McCray, do you understand
business?

21:28.468 --> 21:31.281
You don't get something
for nothing.

21:32.476 --> 21:34.485
You make a good point.

21:35.938 --> 21:38.027
You know, I do have a
little bit of money saved up

21:38.051 --> 21:39.898
from Christmas and
birthdays and stuff.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.165
I could help.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.566
I've got some money.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.069
I was gonna use it to put myself
through law school,

21:45.070 --> 21:47.562
but I could argue
this is more important.

21:56.252 --> 21:57.625
Hey, Grandpa.

21:59.267 --> 22:00.781
They sent us home
from school early.

22:00.782 --> 22:01.941
Said a storm's coming.

22:01.942 --> 22:05.121
They're saying we could get
16 inches of snow.

22:07.212 --> 22:10.442
Look, I want to talk to you
about something.

22:12.835 --> 22:16.225
You'll be fine. I'll show you
everything you need to know.

22:17.624 --> 22:19.736
It's just a big tractor
with a blade on it.

22:19.737 --> 22:23.078
Bo, you're not talking about
having him run the snowplow?

22:23.079 --> 22:27.206
Well, if we're gonna keep up
with this storm, we gotta run 24/7.

22:27.207 --> 22:29.627
Now, I'll work the double shift,
but without John,

22:29.628 --> 22:31.349
I need some help.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.050
He can do it.

22:35.733 --> 22:37.224
I can do it, Grandma.

22:37.225 --> 22:40.423
I've ridden in the cab plenty
of times with him and dad.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.641
You know I wouldn't do this
if I didn't know beyond a doubt

22:44.642 --> 22:46.426
that he can handle it.

22:46.724 --> 22:51.841
OK, but don't you do anything
if you don't feel comfortable with it.

22:51.842 --> 22:53.086
I mean that.

22:53.087 --> 22:54.187
I won't.

22:54.188 --> 22:56.622
Absolutely. I agree with that.

22:57.401 --> 23:00.009
Grandpa, does this job
pay anything?

23:04.519 --> 23:08.553
Um... I'm trying to earn some
money to buy something special.

23:09.277 --> 23:11.599
Well, in fact, yeah,

23:11.600 --> 23:14.222
you do the work,
you get some of the pay.

23:14.223 --> 23:17.697
It's come in handy for us
at times over the years.

23:17.698 --> 23:20.097
Is there any chance
I could get paid up front?

23:21.287 --> 23:24.096
I'm... trying to buy a...

23:24.097 --> 23:26.412
What I'm trying to buy, it's...

23:26.817 --> 23:28.495
I'm trying to buy it
as fast as I can.

23:28.496 --> 23:31.548
Well, let's see what kind of job
you do out there today.

23:32.402 --> 23:34.447
And then we'll talk about it.

23:44.129 --> 23:47.421
Listen while I lower the blade
just one inch.

23:47.811 --> 23:49.533
What do you hear?

23:49.535 --> 23:52.537
Sounds like gravel mixed in
with the snow.

23:52.538 --> 23:53.992
- That's right.

23:54.572 --> 23:55.574
Summer months,

23:55.579 --> 23:58.658
the county pays a lot of money to
put the gravel down on these roads,

23:58.659 --> 24:03.201
and they don't need the McCrays to
be putting it back in the ditch.

24:03.836 --> 24:07.738
There's a fine line;
you just need to find it.

24:13.569 --> 24:16.985
[Man:] <i>By the time we went in
for lunch a few hours later,</i>

24:16.987 --> 24:22.344
<i>Grandpa had spoken more words to me
than he had, well, since my dad died.</i>

24:23.218 --> 24:26.738
<i>It was the start of a big change
in our relationship.</i>

24:29.234 --> 24:31.241
<i>Without us saying it,</i>

24:31.242 --> 24:35.587
<i>maybe we both sensed we could help
begin to fill a hole for the other.</i>

24:40.015 --> 24:42.540
So, I see the snowplow
still seems to be working.

24:42.541 --> 24:44.728
That's good news.
How are the roads?

24:44.729 --> 24:46.601
Better than they were.

24:46.602 --> 24:49.193
He did great.
What can I say?

24:49.194 --> 24:51.487
Filling his dad's shoes.

24:51.488 --> 24:53.426
The kid's a natural.

24:55.705 --> 24:57.465
How many calls came in so far?

24:57.466 --> 25:00.305
Sherry Rather is pregnant,
due any day.

25:00.306 --> 25:02.201
Hadley is worried about
getting her to the hospital,

25:02.202 --> 25:04.328
so he's hoping you could
keep their road clear.

25:04.329 --> 25:07.206
And that's just off Waverly Road.
Do you know where that is?

25:07.207 --> 25:09.985
Yeah, it's south of the highway
and north of Lone Elm Road.

25:09.986 --> 25:13.723
And Mrs. Slater only has
two days of insulin left.

25:13.724 --> 25:16.646
She lives just off the highway
by the old dump site.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.249
I know where that is too.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.014
And Mrs. Reed called

25:21.015 --> 25:22.971
and wants to make sure you
don't forget about her.

25:22.972 --> 25:24.229
Oh, you mean Old Lady Reed.

25:24.230 --> 25:25.502
Careful, George.

25:25.503 --> 25:28.124
She's only a couple of years older
than your grandma here.

25:28.125 --> 25:31.932
We could have gone all day without
revealing that bit of information.

25:32.418 --> 25:34.485
Well, she seems much older.

25:34.486 --> 25:36.224
[Laughing] Oh!

25:36.225 --> 25:39.566
I love having this boy around!
Mwah!

25:44.489 --> 25:46.924
The advance on your wages.

25:53.910 --> 25:55.652
Thanks.

26:12.774 --> 26:15.022
McCray! Hey!

26:18.947 --> 26:20.865
Hey, McCray.

26:23.017 --> 26:25.914
I think you forgot something.

26:27.257 --> 26:29.032
- Your coat?
- Oh, I just have a minute.

26:29.033 --> 26:31.280
I'm helping my mom make dinner.
- You cook?

26:31.477 --> 26:32.974
You don't have to sound so surprised.

26:32.975 --> 26:35.320
McCray, I'm a woman
of many talents,

26:35.321 --> 26:37.506
including being a
world-renowned,

26:37.507 --> 26:41.441
or at least central-Kansas-renowned,
babysitter, which pays OK.

26:42.452 --> 26:44.304
It's not for you,
it's for Tucker.

26:44.618 --> 26:46.767
Look, you really
don't have to do this.

26:46.768 --> 26:48.241
I know.

26:49.930 --> 26:53.109
George, it's freezing out here.
Would you just take the money?

26:53.459 --> 26:55.541
- I'll pay you back.
- Thanks.

26:55.542 --> 26:57.901
I'll see you tomorrow,
with Tucker.

27:09.456 --> 27:11.230
[Tucker barking]

27:11.231 --> 27:13.065
Hey, Tuck.

27:13.066 --> 27:15.336
Oh, you got your stick!

27:15.337 --> 27:17.015
Your stick!

27:20.900 --> 27:22.903
[Door opening]

27:28.646 --> 27:30.276
Hi, Mr. Thorne.

27:30.519 --> 27:33.830
Uh, I came by because, um...

27:35.044 --> 27:38.416
I was thinking I didn't
make myself clear earlier.

27:39.734 --> 27:42.079
I'd be interested
in buying your dog.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.383
You would, huh?

27:43.384 --> 27:45.369
Yes, yes, I would.

27:45.370 --> 27:46.998
And I've got money.

27:47.931 --> 27:50.688
I don't want your money.
Dog's not for sale.

27:50.689 --> 27:54.025
But why? You just leave
him out here in the cold.

27:54.713 --> 27:59.061
I can do with him what I want.
He's my dog, and he's not for sale.

27:59.328 --> 28:01.942
You McCrays aren't better than me.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.068
Time for you to go.

28:16.604 --> 28:19.032
[Tucker whining]

28:30.450 --> 28:32.271
- <i>Grandma said you didn't
eat much at dinner.</i>

28:32.272 --> 28:33.830
<i>Are you sure you're feeling OK?</i>

28:33.831 --> 28:35.006
I'm fine.

28:35.007 --> 28:37.470
She thinks you might be down
because you're missing Tucker.

28:37.471 --> 28:39.575
- Maybe.
- <i>Oh, honey.</i>

28:39.576 --> 28:42.131
I wish I could be there
to make things better.

28:42.132 --> 28:45.128
I'm sorry everything has been
so unsettled lately.

28:45.129 --> 28:47.082
It's just not fair, Mom.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.641
I know, Georgie. I'm sorry.

28:49.643 --> 28:52.875
Dad always taught us
to deal with things head-on.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.310
Tucker should be with me,

28:55.311 --> 28:58.352
where he can run around and play.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.093
All he does at Thorne's is bark.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.594
I'd bark too if I was alone all day.

29:04.595 --> 29:08.078
Well, then we'll try not to leave you alone
too much when you get here.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.138
We wouldn't want you
waking the neighbours.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.914
Funny, Mom.

29:12.991 --> 29:15.403
I'm sorry about Tucker, George.

29:16.719 --> 29:19.464
Yeah. Me too.

29:29.666 --> 29:31.843
- Morning, Grandpa.
- Morning.

29:33.374 --> 29:35.202
Weather's gotten worse today.

29:35.203 --> 29:38.191
Yeah. Wouldn't stop snowing
all night. I can vouch for that.

29:38.192 --> 29:41.750
- You were out on the snowplow all night?
- Yeah, until about an hour ago.

29:42.477 --> 29:44.605
You've already done
all the milking.

29:44.606 --> 29:45.962
Why didn't anybody wake me up?

29:45.963 --> 29:50.581
Well, you got a long day ahead of you,
so we figured we'd let you sleep in a bit.

29:51.236 --> 29:53.603
- What's all this about?
- Milk trucks can't get through,

29:53.604 --> 29:55.588
and the cooler here is full up.

29:56.271 --> 29:58.095
Are we not keeping
the roads clear enough?

29:58.096 --> 30:00.418
Oh, we're doing fine.
It's just, in some areas,

30:00.442 --> 30:02.740
the snowplows
have fallen behind.

30:02.741 --> 30:06.525
They don't have the personnel to
run around the clock like we do.

30:07.529 --> 30:10.623
And since the dairy won't
accept milk that isn't fresh,

30:10.624 --> 30:13.918
what we can't use ourselves
we just have to throw away.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.504
Well, that seems like a waste
of perfectly good milk.

30:16.505 --> 30:19.337
Which is why we're bottling it
up for you to give to folks.

30:19.338 --> 30:23.015
With more and more phone lines
down and the roads blocked,

30:23.016 --> 30:26.402
folks can't get their basics,
people can't get to the store.

30:26.403 --> 30:28.509
And we got milk to give away.

30:28.988 --> 30:31.354
Here, I'll help you load up.

30:32.404 --> 30:35.085
Pull in to every house,
knock on their doors,

30:35.086 --> 30:38.098
and make sure everybody's
getting along all right, hmm?

30:56.538 --> 30:58.507
[Tucker barking inside]

30:59.377 --> 31:01.594
Hey, boy. It's me.

31:02.884 --> 31:04.681

31:19.824 --> 31:22.514
Hi. How are ya?

31:24.432 --> 31:27.384
I know, I know.
I missed you too.

Hello?

31:40.436 --> 31:42.419
It's George McCray.

What do you want, boy?

32:04.847 --> 32:05.962
Uh...

32:05.963 --> 32:08.297
I have milk if you need any.

32:09.454 --> 32:12.776
I don't need milk.
I'm sick. I need medicine.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.041
I don't have any medicine.

32:16.043 --> 32:18.025
No, I suppose not.

32:22.087 --> 32:23.909
I'll tell you what.

32:25.272 --> 32:27.825
If you drive that snowplow

32:27.826 --> 32:31.025
over to Tommy Turner's place
on Blackberry Hill,

32:31.026 --> 32:33.340
and you tell him that
Frank Thorne's in a tight spot

32:33.341 --> 32:37.423
and needs two bottles
of his best, uh... medicine,

32:37.424 --> 32:39.582
and you bring it back to me,

32:40.182 --> 32:42.548
maybe we can talk about
my dog being for sale, huh?

32:43.499 --> 32:45.267
You'd sell him to me?

32:45.268 --> 32:46.901
Uh-huh.

32:51.142 --> 32:54.168
That's... my dad.

we were friends once?

33:01.303 --> 33:04.170
I guess you wouldn't
expect that, would ya?

33:06.628 --> 33:09.506
Your father wasn't always
so perfect.

33:10.232 --> 33:11.991
So, what do you say, kid?

33:12.682 --> 33:14.765
You want the dog?

33:15.709 --> 33:17.170
OK.

to make sure you're all right.

I've got some milk
if you need some.

Association.</i>

I should ask you for some medicine.

two big glasses every night,

35:14.928 --> 35:18.072
and you let him know I'll be
sending him my doctor's bill.

35:19.136 --> 35:22.125
This business is between
me and Thorne, boy.

35:22.126 --> 35:24.714

- No, I said we'd talk about it.

he won't wake up.

Is he breathing?

Yes, but he doesn't look good,
and the house is cold.

I'll call an ambulance.
You just stay there.

You being on this couch isn't the
start of some new trend, you know.

39:36.798 --> 39:41.299
But considering what you've been
through today, it's OK for right now.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.786

poisoning's pretty serious.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.354
Yeah, well, if you hadn't gone by
there, there's a good chance that

Yeah.

Looks like you still got
your appetite.

and Christmas sugar cookies.

to take my chances.

of running this beast?

Yep.

too much stock into that.

turn down food yet.

and sisters getting here?

40:50.730 --> 40:51.763
- The 23rd.

40:51.764 --> 40:54.992
And then you'll go back to
Minnesota with them after New Year's?

40:55.101 --> 40:56.197
I guess so.

40:56.198 --> 40:57.893
Will you visit in the summers?

40:58.582 --> 41:00.201
Uh, maybe.

41:00.401 --> 41:01.735
I don't know.

41:01.736 --> 41:03.638
I'd like to.

Well, it's nice that your
family will be here in time

to see you in your
starring role as Santa.

41:09.371 --> 41:10.371
Hm.

41:10.544 --> 41:12.286
You have been
learning your lines?

41:12.287 --> 41:13.948
Well, I was thinking that...

41:13.949 --> 41:17.177
with all the missed days of school
that the play might be...

41:17.178 --> 41:18.933
you know, cancelled.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.399
I wouldn't count on it.

In Mrs. Weeks' words,
"The show must go on".

she made that up.

the gravel, just the snow.

41:34.827 --> 41:35.971
[Click]

41:36.446 --> 41:39.185
Tucker, that's the radio.

41:39.186 --> 41:40.797
- [Cora:] <i>Hello?</i>
- [Bark]

41:41.617 --> 41:43.087
Yeah, you like that, huh, boy?

41:43.878 --> 41:45.282
Push it again.

41:45.764 --> 41:46.908
[Click]

41:47.774 --> 41:49.257
OK, speak.

41:49.258 --> 41:50.253
[Bark]

41:50.254 --> 41:51.528
George?

41:53.118 --> 41:54.937
OK, push the button, boy.

41:54.957 --> 41:56.101
[Click]

41:56.288 --> 41:58.212
- Speak.
- [Bark]

41:59.272 --> 42:01.579
Tucker, is that you?

42:01.580 --> 42:03.784
<i>[Barking]</i>

42:04.741 --> 42:07.619
Tell George I'm making
a pot roast for him tonight.

42:07.621 --> 42:08.685
Hey, Grandma.

42:08.686 --> 42:11.320
I was just showing Tucker
how to drive the snowplow,

42:11.321 --> 42:15.191
and I guess he wanted to learn
how to use the radio too. - [Bark]

42:15.714 --> 42:16.913
[Laughing]

42:16.914 --> 42:20.134
Well, sounds like he's a good
student and a quick study.

42:20.135 --> 42:21.660
[Barking]

42:21.661 --> 42:24.827
Tucker, listen,
I have to go out for a while,

42:24.828 --> 42:26.756
so I won't be here if you call.

42:26.759 --> 42:28.773
Push the button, boy. Bark.

42:28.797 --> 42:29.779
[Click]

42:29.780 --> 42:31.482
[Barking]

42:32.599 --> 42:34.683
He says we'll see you
when we get home.

42:34.684 --> 42:35.726
OK.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.209
[Laughing]

42:38.090 --> 42:39.546
Good boy, Tucker.

42:39.547 --> 42:41.078
Good boy.

42:41.079 --> 42:44.405
I bet I could teach you to drive
this if I had enough cookies.

42:49.989 --> 42:52.563
OK, I'm officially
on my lunch break,

42:52.564 --> 42:54.110
but we don't have time to play.

42:54.111 --> 42:57.052
We're gonna do something good
and surprise Grandma.

42:59.205 --> 43:01.315
Ever look for a Christmas tree
before?

43:02.651 --> 43:04.067
Didn't think so.

43:04.068 --> 43:05.151
But it's an art.

43:05.152 --> 43:06.301
[Tucker barking]

43:06.302 --> 43:08.910
At least,
that's what Grandma says.

43:09.340 --> 43:11.830
She likes something full--

43:12.623 --> 43:15.108
You know, lots of branches.

43:15.109 --> 43:17.828
Not too skinny or scrawny.

43:18.303 --> 43:21.341
And tall but... not too tall.

43:21.566 --> 43:24.611
You gotta leave a little room
for the angel that goes on top.

43:25.762 --> 43:28.122
And it's gotta be a Scotch Pine.

43:28.644 --> 43:29.917
[Tucker barking]

43:29.918 --> 43:31.647
Now, Grandpa,

43:32.410 --> 43:34.201
he could go for anything--

43:34.202 --> 43:38.505
a Douglas fir, some kind
of spruce, even a cedar.

43:38.506 --> 43:40.318
But Grandma...

43:40.319 --> 43:42.736
Grandma loves her Scotch Pine.

43:47.715 --> 43:49.697
Oh, I think we have a winner.

43:55.459 --> 43:57.223
Oh, it's perfect.

43:57.224 --> 43:59.171
I love it!

43:59.172 --> 44:00.916
Thank you, George.

44:01.156 --> 44:04.062
- Tucker picked it out.
- Well, he did a great job.

44:04.063 --> 44:05.992
You both did.
[Door closing]

44:07.420 --> 44:08.856
Bo,

44:08.857 --> 44:11.411
look at the tree
George cut for us.

44:11.412 --> 44:13.768
I think it's as nice
as any tree we've ever had.

44:13.769 --> 44:16.595
Looks like he's taken over
all my jobs around here.

44:16.596 --> 44:20.119
Pretty soon
I won't be needed at all.

44:22.479 --> 44:26.273
Hey, it, uh, looks like
Thorne's gonna be all right.

44:26.274 --> 44:28.817
He's coming home
from the hospital tomorrow.

44:29.366 --> 44:30.744
That's good.

44:30.970 --> 44:32.377
- Yeah.

44:32.590 --> 44:34.122
It was touch-and-go for a while.

44:34.123 --> 44:38.120
Turns out whatever homebrew
he was drinking was contaminated.

44:38.121 --> 44:39.231
Almost killed him.

44:39.232 --> 44:41.771
Who knows under what conditions
that stuff gets made.

44:41.772 --> 44:45.306
Yeah, well, he's not talking
about where he got it, but...

44:45.307 --> 44:47.932
I think we got
a pretty good idea.

44:49.047 --> 44:51.029
Well, how's he getting home?

44:51.328 --> 44:53.037
That I don't know.

44:53.038 --> 44:54.835
Oh, I do.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.729
Nice of you to pick me up.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.087
You seem to be moving OK.

45:11.088 --> 45:12.974
Yeah. I feel better.

45:12.976 --> 45:16.141
You got lucky, Frank.
If George hadn't been there,

45:16.142 --> 45:18.092
things could have been worse.

45:18.648 --> 45:20.463
So they tell me.

45:20.914 --> 45:23.248
Much obliged to you for that.

45:24.670 --> 45:27.165
We'll be keeping Tucker with us.

45:28.212 --> 45:31.140
George, you give Thorne a hand
if he needs it.

45:36.102 --> 45:38.884
- Need any help?
- No, I'm fine.

45:46.813 --> 45:49.313
Well, It looks like Cora's here.

45:49.578 --> 45:53.053
[Door opening and closing]
[Tucker barking]

45:53.367 --> 45:55.934
Oh, I thought I heard
somebody drive up.

45:58.468 --> 46:03.042
Grandma, this place looks...
different.

46:03.450 --> 46:05.384
Welcome home, Frank.

46:07.156 --> 46:09.090
Not sure I'm in the right house.

46:09.091 --> 46:10.097
[Cora laughs]

46:10.098 --> 46:12.048
Oh, it's the right house, all right.

46:12.359 --> 46:14.918
I bet it feels good to be home.

46:15.159 --> 46:17.172
I figured after a couple
of days of hospital food,

46:17.181 --> 46:18.846
you might be ready
for a home-cooked meal,

46:18.847 --> 46:21.352
so I hope you don't mind,
I'm using your stove.

46:21.353 --> 46:23.848
Yeah, I'm sure he's real upset
about that, huh, Frank?

46:23.850 --> 46:25.460
[Laughing]

46:27.326 --> 46:29.070
Mrs. McCray...

46:29.832 --> 46:31.433
You're very kind.

46:31.434 --> 46:33.212
Just being neighbourly.

46:33.572 --> 46:35.848
But I'm glad
you're feeling better.

46:36.933 --> 46:38.885
You've always been good to me.

46:40.473 --> 46:43.482
John and I did a lot of things
together,

46:43.483 --> 46:45.607
but even when I got him in trouble

46:45.608 --> 46:48.401
and we stopped hanging
around each other,

46:48.402 --> 46:50.407
you always showed me kindness.

46:52.255 --> 46:55.675
Even when I
wasn't very nice to any of you.

46:58.189 --> 47:00.347
I'm gonna change my ways.

47:01.377 --> 47:05.436
And I know that's easy to say,

47:05.437 --> 47:07.051
but you mark my words this time.

47:07.052 --> 47:09.352
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Frank.

47:09.353 --> 47:12.134
And we'll be here for you.

47:13.712 --> 47:15.373
[Laughing and sniffling]

47:15.374 --> 47:17.655
There hasn't been Christmas
in this house in a long time.

47:17.656 --> 47:18.949
Oh.

47:21.313 --> 47:24.609
[Man:] <i>The idea of angels has
always appealed to me,</i>

47:24.610 --> 47:29.016
<i>and Grandma Cora was the closest
thing to an angel I ever knew.</i>

47:29.017 --> 47:31.032
<i>I know Thorne felt the same way.</i>

47:33.352 --> 47:37.286
<i>And Grandma's kindness made me feel
even worse for what I had done.</i>

47:38.461 --> 47:42.323
<i>It all made me realize I didn't
want to keep holding it inside.</i>

47:43.464 --> 47:46.086
<i>It was time to tell Grandpa.</i>

47:47.969 --> 47:50.332
Grandpa...

47:50.333 --> 47:52.165
that was a really nice thing
that Grandma did.

47:52.166 --> 47:54.168
Yes, it was, George.

47:55.319 --> 47:57.314
That's your grandmother.

47:57.798 --> 48:00.794
Do you think Mr. Thorne will
really be able to change?

48:00.795 --> 48:02.301
Well, I hope so.

48:02.302 --> 48:04.118
I really do.

48:04.119 --> 48:08.158
There's a good lesson for you
in all his problems.

48:08.159 --> 48:13.533
Nobody starts down that road thinking
they're gonna be the one who can't stop.

48:16.094 --> 48:18.835
- Could he really have died?
- Yeah.

48:19.118 --> 48:21.079
Yeah, Thorne's responsible
for his actions,

48:21.080 --> 48:22.839
but the person that gave him that stuff,

48:22.840 --> 48:25.429
well, they should have
some consequences too.

48:27.687 --> 48:29.076
[George sighs]

48:30.247 --> 48:32.917
About that...
the person who gave it to him--

48:32.918 --> 48:35.343
I don't think it's
any secret who that is.

48:35.344 --> 48:38.631
Thorne hadn't said,
but I got a good idea.

48:38.632 --> 48:41.016
Well, it could be that there's
more to it than what we've--

48:41.017 --> 48:42.202
[Thunderclap]
- Whoa.

48:42.203 --> 48:44.735
Looks like the weatherman was right.

48:44.736 --> 48:47.794
Yeah, they said there was
a winter thunderstorm on its way,

48:47.795 --> 48:49.803
and it looks like it's here now.

48:49.804 --> 48:51.798
You've probably never seen one,

48:51.799 --> 48:54.197
at least since you were
a little guy.

48:55.164 --> 48:57.928
Winter thunderstorm?
You mean like rain?

48:57.929 --> 49:00.524
Well, it starts with rain,
then turns to ice,

49:00.525 --> 49:02.717
more snow on top.

49:02.718 --> 49:04.732
You think a snowstorm is bad?

49:04.733 --> 49:06.747
Nothing compared to the ice.

49:07.261 --> 49:10.632
It's gonna warm up,
and this snow can turn to rain.

49:11.245 --> 49:14.146
Oh. I guess it's a good thing
we were headed to get supplies.

49:14.147 --> 49:18.063
Yep, 'cause once things start freezing,
there's nobody going nowhere,

49:18.064 --> 49:20.958
including us and the snowplow.

49:21.453 --> 49:23.604
[Santa ringing bells]

49:23.627 --> 49:25.064
[Santa:] Ho, ho, ho!

49:25.065 --> 49:27.946
You can stay here in the truck
with Tucker if you want.

49:27.947 --> 49:29.929
I'll just be a minute.

49:34.172 --> 49:35.337
[Bark]

49:35.691 --> 49:38.974
Go get it. Now come here,
come here. Come on, come on.

49:39.608 --> 49:41.033
[Thunderclap]

49:44.587 --> 49:46.518
It's getting closer, Tuck.

49:47.441 --> 49:50.010
All right, here, one more,
one more. Ready?

49:50.011 --> 49:51.229
[Bark]

49:52.005 --> 49:53.850
Afternoon, McCray.

49:54.063 --> 49:55.328
Mr. Turner.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.437
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

49:57.461 --> 49:59.211
and presume that
you're smart enough

49:59.212 --> 50:01.511
not to tell anyone about
any delivers you might

50:01.534 --> 50:03.665
have made on my behalf
to Frank Thorne, huh?

50:03.666 --> 50:05.934
No, I haven't told
anyone about anything.

50:05.935 --> 50:08.243
You see, there's
the right answer.

50:08.244 --> 50:11.372
I just want to make sure we
keep it that way. - [Barking]

50:14.448 --> 50:16.398
You like this mutt, don't you?

50:17.772 --> 50:20.469
Well, here's something
for you to think about.

50:20.470 --> 50:23.989
If even one person were to get wind

50:23.990 --> 50:27.899
that Frank Thorne got that
rotten batch of booze from me,

50:27.900 --> 50:32.198
well, your dog has played
its last game of fetch.

50:32.199 --> 50:33.662
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

50:33.663 --> 50:35.706
- Huh?
- Yes.

50:48.814 --> 50:51.230
So, what are we gonna do?

50:51.231 --> 50:54.646
Well, there's nothing we can do if it
gets as bad as they say it's gonna get.

50:54.670 --> 50:56.435
What about Mrs. Slater
and all the others

50:56.436 --> 50:58.106
who depend on us to get them
their medicine?

50:58.108 --> 51:00.463
- Well, I don't like it
any better than you do.

51:00.468 --> 51:04.670
These kinds of storms are
extremely rare, but, uh...

51:04.671 --> 51:07.531
once they hit us,
we're paralyzed.

51:07.844 --> 51:09.250
Morning, George.

51:09.676 --> 51:10.793
[She clears her throat]

51:10.794 --> 51:13.812
Sorry. My alarm didn't go off.

51:14.228 --> 51:15.802
I think it might be broken.

51:15.803 --> 51:17.129
It wouldn't even light up.

51:17.130 --> 51:20.140
The freezing rain got
even worse last night,

51:20.141 --> 51:22.940
and the whole Tri-County
area is out of power.

51:22.941 --> 51:24.921
Lines are down everywhere.

51:24.922 --> 51:26.441
Your grandpa's gone out,

51:26.442 --> 51:28.616
fired up the generation
to give us a little power.

51:29.887 --> 51:31.175
[Door opening]

51:31.176 --> 51:32.640
- Whoa.

51:33.007 --> 51:34.832
Nasty out there.

51:34.833 --> 51:38.319
Don't you be going out there today.
It's like walking on a sheet of ice.

51:38.320 --> 51:41.474
- Too easy to fall and break something.
- Well, then, what are you doing out there?

51:41.478 --> 51:43.292
Well, if I fall, I'm
gonna land on my head.

51:43.316 --> 51:45.809
You said many times,
it's too hard to break. - [Laughing]

51:46.876 --> 51:48.781
- I don't like you
out there in this.

51:48.782 --> 51:51.949
You fall, break your hip,
I'm not taking care of ya.

51:52.168 --> 51:53.632
Look, George,

51:54.280 --> 51:58.856
if you let me fall out there, you're
gonna be doing some cooking yourself.

51:59.478 --> 52:01.652
See if that fits your shoe.

52:03.461 --> 52:05.666
[Bo coughing]

52:06.062 --> 52:08.561
I don't like the sound of that.

52:09.188 --> 52:10.279
What is it?

52:10.280 --> 52:12.425
It hooks on your boot,
keeps you from slipping.

52:12.426 --> 52:13.411
- Ah, ah, ah.

52:13.412 --> 52:16.900
Not in the house, not unless
you want to redo all my floors.

52:19.284 --> 52:21.776
- Well, looks like it'll fit.
- Well, good,

52:21.777 --> 52:25.821
'cause after you've finished eating,
we're gonna walk over to Hank Fisher's.

52:25.822 --> 52:28.261
You got me to
thinking last night.

52:28.262 --> 52:29.841
I got an idea.

52:30.543 --> 52:32.919
The cookies were George's idea.

52:32.920 --> 52:36.092
He said you couldn't resist
helping us if we brought 'em.

52:37.184 --> 52:39.164
Boy knows how to bargain.

52:41.145 --> 52:42.623
[Whining]

52:42.624 --> 52:44.612
Dog knows how to get
what he wants too.

52:44.613 --> 52:46.531
Here you go, Tucker.

52:48.311 --> 52:50.817
Never knew this dog had
so much personality.

52:50.818 --> 52:52.828
Seems as though he's
blossoming since you took him.

52:52.833 --> 52:56.350
That old Tuck wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for George.

52:56.351 --> 52:58.249
He done a good job--
[Coughing]

52:58.250 --> 52:59.428
- That doesn't sound too good.

52:59.429 --> 53:01.222
I don't think an old duffer
like you ought to be out

53:01.226 --> 53:02.909
walking a mile and a half
in this kind of weather.

53:02.910 --> 53:04.713
I'm only a couple of years
older than you.

53:04.714 --> 53:07.465
You wouldn't find me walking
to your place today either.

53:07.466 --> 53:09.835
He used to be tough.

53:09.836 --> 53:11.783
Too many chocolate chip cookies.

53:11.784 --> 53:13.773
Oh, by golly.

53:15.216 --> 53:17.090
I still got 'em.

53:17.091 --> 53:19.534
I think these just might
do the trick.

53:19.535 --> 53:22.562
[Man:] <i>Grandpa had gotten the idea
from our shoe clamps.</i>

53:22.563 --> 53:26.189
<i>He remembered Hank buying some old
logging chains at a farm auction a while back,</i>

53:26.213 --> 53:29.296
<i>and had a hunch he'd never done
anything with those chains.</i>

53:29.297 --> 53:32.231
<i>Like usual, Grandpa was right.</i>

53:32.232 --> 53:35.310
Now, cut some of these rods
into small-scale studs,

53:35.311 --> 53:37.333
probably work just like your shoes do.

53:37.334 --> 53:40.323
Big test'll come when you drop the blade.
Hopefully the welds'll hold.

53:40.324 --> 53:43.892
I believe they will if we
only grade going downhill.

53:43.893 --> 53:47.865
Takes a little longer, but it beats
staying inside doing nothing.

53:48.340 --> 53:50.752
So, how fast can you have this?

53:51.018 --> 53:53.328
Tomorrow, midmorning, maybe.

53:54.155 --> 53:56.495
Bring some of those cookies.

54:00.649 --> 54:04.392
So, uh, when did Hank say
the chains would be ready?

54:07.171 --> 54:09.682
Didn't he just sit down in that
chair about 30 seconds ago?

54:09.683 --> 54:10.997
He did.

54:11.343 --> 54:14.221
I wish I could get to sleep that fast.

54:18.550 --> 54:22.190
Is it getting any easier
to sleep as time goes by?

54:23.512 --> 54:25.055
Yeah.

54:26.397 --> 54:28.301
I miss being able
to talk to him, though.

54:30.032 --> 54:31.668
So do I.

54:33.685 --> 54:37.029
But the work has made me
more tired, and...

54:37.030 --> 54:38.923
that'll keep me asleep.

54:39.897 --> 54:41.680
But not like that.

54:41.681 --> 54:43.595
He hasn't been feeling so good.

54:44.834 --> 54:47.164
Of course, that's one of the
benefits of getting older--

54:47.165 --> 54:50.488
you can fall asleep anywhere
in a few seconds.

54:50.489 --> 54:53.021
The downside is, though, that
you wake up in the middle

54:53.045 --> 54:55.372
of the night wondering if
it's too early to get up.

54:55.373 --> 54:57.360
Well, once I'm asleep,

54:57.361 --> 54:59.819
I have no problems
getting up too early.

54:59.820 --> 55:01.213
[Laughing]

55:11.086 --> 55:14.320
I hope Mom, Trisha, and Hannah
can make it here for Christmas.

55:14.731 --> 55:17.032
Oh, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, George.

55:17.033 --> 55:20.124
A lot can happen with
the weather in a couple of days.

55:20.125 --> 55:21.480
They'll make it.

55:22.359 --> 55:24.491
It's gonna be a hard Christmas.

55:30.798 --> 55:33.676
There are still gonna be
a lot of hard days, George.

55:34.156 --> 55:36.586
But we'll get through 'em.

55:37.926 --> 55:40.374
That was a nice thing
you did for Thorne yesterday.

55:42.486 --> 55:44.719
Frank's had a tough life.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.270
He didn't have much help
growing up.

55:48.290 --> 55:50.183
But he and dad were friends?

55:50.184 --> 55:53.459
When they were young,
they were together all the time.

55:53.460 --> 55:54.979
Very close.

55:55.653 --> 55:59.826
Then Frank kind of veered off in
another direction in high school.

55:59.978 --> 56:02.620
Your dad still tried
to be his friend--

56:02.621 --> 56:06.115
the only real friend
Frank had, I might say.

56:08.930 --> 56:12.279
But Frank went his own way.

56:16.587 --> 56:19.209
Your dad was a very good man.

56:21.531 --> 56:23.769
And you so remind me of him.

56:26.051 --> 56:27.108
[Kiss]

56:28.953 --> 56:30.526
[Tucker growling]
Oh.

56:30.527 --> 56:31.610
[Laughing]

56:31.611 --> 56:35.451
And yes, Tucker, you're lucky
to have him looking after you.

56:35.452 --> 56:38.646
I swear, this dog understands
everything we say.

56:38.647 --> 56:40.559
Ha! Ha! Ha! Don't you?

56:40.560 --> 56:43.182
[Man:] <i>Somehow I didn't think
Grandma would think so highly of me</i>

56:43.206 --> 56:44.853
<i>if she knew
what I'd done.</i>

56:47.807 --> 56:50.096
[Bo coughing]
[Kettle whistling]

56:50.940 --> 56:53.194
- You can go back to bed.
- Can I?

56:53.195 --> 56:55.273
George has already done
the milking.

56:55.275 --> 56:56.606
- What?
- Mm, yeah.

56:56.607 --> 57:00.845
He knew you weren't feeling well,
so he decided to beat you to it.

57:00.869 --> 57:02.997
[Door closing]
- Morning, Grandpa.

57:04.400 --> 57:08.139
- Well, you be sure and make him
an extra special good breakfast.

57:08.406 --> 57:10.148
A boy like that deserves it.

57:10.149 --> 57:11.770
That he does.

57:12.389 --> 57:15.597
Well, I might just rest up
a bit in my chair.

57:31.954 --> 57:32.960
[Hank laughing]

57:32.973 --> 57:36.046
- Well, it seems to be working.
- I'll say, indeed it does.

57:36.048 --> 57:38.352
But you be careful out there.
Don't you take any chances.

57:38.353 --> 57:39.834
I won't.

57:51.518 --> 57:55.639
[Man:] <i>I found it amazing how one bad decision
could seep into everything else around it</i>

57:55.640 --> 57:58.902
<i>and make even good things
seem not so good.</i>

58:05.094 --> 58:08.219
I can see how a person could
gain weight doing this job.

58:08.220 --> 58:10.209
Everybody's grateful
for what you're doing.

58:10.210 --> 58:12.967
And nothing shows grateful
like a homemade cookie.

58:13.867 --> 58:15.883
I can't believe you're
moving around on that ice.

58:15.885 --> 58:18.865
I mean, I fell twice
just getting out here.

58:18.866 --> 58:20.880
It seems to be working pretty well.

58:21.176 --> 58:22.680
It was Grandpa's idea.

58:22.681 --> 58:24.656
All the McCrays are stepping up.

58:24.657 --> 58:26.231
Runs in the family.

58:28.216 --> 58:30.998
Have you ever done something
you wish you didn't?

58:32.228 --> 58:33.262
Yes.

58:33.263 --> 58:37.132
That time I told Mr. Fairly that my cousins
in Iowa had more math homework than we did.

58:37.133 --> 58:38.745
That was kind of stupid,

58:38.746 --> 58:41.954
'cause he suddenly felt like he had to
pile more work on us after that.

58:41.955 --> 58:45.696
No, but something quite a bit
worse than that.

58:46.291 --> 58:48.497
What are you getting at, McCray?

58:52.144 --> 58:54.651
- <i>George. George,</i>
are you there?

58:56.041 --> 58:57.403
Hey, Grandma. We're here.

58:57.404 --> 58:59.904
George, do you know where
Doc Johnson lives?

58:59.905 --> 59:01.163
- Yeah.
- Good.

59:01.164 --> 59:04.678
I need you to go over there right now
and pick him up and bring him here.

59:04.679 --> 59:06.916
OK. Is something wrong?

59:08.036 --> 59:11.094
He just needs to come
and take a look at your grandpa.

59:11.095 --> 59:13.941
<i>I've already radioed him.
He's expecting you.</i>

59:14.071 --> 59:15.030
OK.

59:15.489 --> 59:17.063
Right now, George.

59:17.065 --> 59:18.640
You understand?

59:18.641 --> 59:20.350
- I'm on my way.
- <i>Good.</i>

59:22.980 --> 59:25.125
- He's got a severe infection in his lungs.

59:25.126 --> 59:26.841
It's not pneumonia yet,

59:26.842 --> 59:29.720
but it could be
if we aren't careful.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.557
I gave him some antibiotics,

59:32.558 --> 59:35.978
and I want you to make sure that
he takes these as prescribed.

59:36.650 --> 59:39.080
You did the right thing
by calling me, Mrs. McCray.

59:39.081 --> 59:42.136
This would not have waited
for the roads to open up--

59:42.137 --> 59:44.541
despite what a good job
you're doing.

59:44.542 --> 59:47.442
Thank you, Doctor.
I really appreciate it.

59:48.574 --> 59:53.354
Well, if my taxi service is ready,
I'll make my way back home.

59:53.355 --> 59:54.527
Sure.

59:54.528 --> 59:57.598
- He's doing a great job out here.
- Oh, I know it.

59:57.599 --> 01:00:00.432
I don't know what we would
have done without him.

01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:07.958
[Tucker whining]

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.787
Hey, George.

01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:15.859
Among everything else
you've been doing,

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.675
now you've added
ambulance driver?

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:22.600
I'm sure you know this,
but, uh...

01:00:22.601 --> 01:00:25.062
I am very, very proud of you.

01:00:27.937 --> 01:00:31.028
But... I think if you knew
the truth, you wouldn't be.

01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:35.189
There's something
you don't know.

01:00:36.654 --> 01:00:38.862
[Man:] <i>When I told him the truth,</i>

01:00:38.863 --> 01:00:42.199
<i>it's the most disappointment
I'd ever seen in Grandpa's eyes.</i>

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.521
[George:] ...only if I got him
some medicine.

01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:52.248
[Man:] <i>And it was the most disappointed
I'd ever felt in myself.</i>

01:00:55.032 --> 01:00:56.714
I was wrong.

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:59.036
You don't deserve Tucker.

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:02.823
- Bo, that's a bit harsh.
- I don't think it is.

01:01:03.722 --> 01:01:07.482
When you finish your work
at the end of the day,

01:01:07.483 --> 01:01:11.963
you go by Thorne's house and
you drop Tucker off with him.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.402
OK?

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:22.624
OK.

01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:28.140
I didn't have any choice.

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:33.141
Maybe not, but...

01:01:33.142 --> 01:01:35.531
it's still sad for him.

01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:57.220
I really messed things up.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.810
Whoa.

01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:23.165
Ugh!

01:02:23.966 --> 01:02:26.094
[Barking]

01:02:30.828 --> 01:02:32.541
[Whining]

01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:37.391
[Barking]

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:40.007
[Groaning weakly]

01:02:41.867 --> 01:02:43.630
Tucker...
[Coughing]

01:02:43.631 --> 01:02:45.129
[Bark]

01:02:46.165 --> 01:02:47.574
Tucker, push the button.

01:02:47.575 --> 01:02:49.646
[Barking]

01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:51.944
Hit the radio button.

01:02:53.024 --> 01:02:54.899
[Barking]

01:02:55.483 --> 01:02:57.465
Hit the radio button.

01:02:59.334 --> 01:03:00.478
[Click]

01:03:00.587 --> 01:03:02.523
Good. Good.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:04.470
Hit it again.

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.658
[Click]

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:08.534
Now bark. Speak.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.682
[Barking]

01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:12.658
[Cora:] <i>All right, you two, OK.</i>

01:03:12.659 --> 01:03:14.028
<i>You've got my attention.</i>

01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.112
<i>I'm glad you're
having fun out there.</i>

01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:17.583
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:17.584 --> 01:03:21.103
Yes, hello, Tucker. Where's George?
I want to speak to George.

01:03:21.104 --> 01:03:22.413
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:23.476 --> 01:03:26.083
Well, all right, then.
I'll speak to you.

01:03:26.084 --> 01:03:27.867
Tell me, where's George?

01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:30.170
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:30.171 --> 01:03:32.506
- <i>OK, joke's over now.</i>

01:03:32.507 --> 01:03:34.946
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:34.947 --> 01:03:36.552
- <i>This isn't funny, George.</i>

01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:40.387
Come on, now. Get down to business.
Where are you? What's up?

01:03:40.388 --> 01:03:41.422
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:41.423 --> 01:03:42.989
- <i>Grandma...</i>

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.204
George?

01:03:45.205 --> 01:03:46.858
- <i>Grandma...</i>

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.555
<i>[Tucker barking]</i>

01:03:48.556 --> 01:03:50.169
George, where are you?

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.817
<i>Where are you, George?</i>

01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:53.864
[Whining]

01:03:57.948 --> 01:04:00.700
Would someone out there
please talk to me?

01:04:01.346 --> 01:04:03.042
Tucker...
[Tucker whining]

01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:04.473
- <i>George!</i>

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.273
[Tucker whining]

01:04:07.293 --> 01:04:09.390
Go get help. Go home.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.482
Get Grandma.

01:04:13.226 --> 01:04:14.813
Go get Grandma.

01:04:14.814 --> 01:04:16.040
[Barking]

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.953
Oh, Frank.
Thank God you're home.

01:04:21.954 --> 01:04:23.622
Is something wrong,
Mrs. McCray?

01:04:23.623 --> 01:04:25.829
- <i>Well, I'm afraid something
may have happened to George.</i>

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:28.707
He's out in the snowplow,
I'm not sure exactly where,

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:31.667
but I do know he was headed
out toward Old Orchard Road.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:35.126
I've radioed the county, but they
don't have anyone else in the area,

01:04:35.127 --> 01:04:36.747
and our phones are out, but I knew,

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:38.953
since we're on the same line,
I'd be able to get through to you.

01:04:38.954 --> 01:04:40.950
I'm going right now.
Don't you worry. I'll find him.

01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:42.485
Thank you, Frank.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.369
[Panting]

01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:17.743
Here, dog!

01:05:20.477 --> 01:05:21.736
Here, dog!

01:05:21.737 --> 01:05:23.902
Come on, boy.
[Barking]

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:51.720
[Whining]

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.585
[Hank:] Cora. George is awake.

01:06:08.217 --> 01:06:10.999
George, George,
just stay down now.

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:16.683
You gave us quite a scare.

01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:19.353
No, doc says he'll be fine.

01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:20.381
He's OK.

01:06:20.382 --> 01:06:22.820
Hank... we gotta get
the snowplow going.

01:06:22.844 --> 01:06:24.414
P-people are
counting on us out there.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.117
We're way ahead of you, son.

01:06:26.118 --> 01:06:28.691
Frank Thorne took it out just
after he got you back here.

01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:32.500
He's taking Sherry Rather to the hospital,
where she's about to deliver twins.

01:06:32.501 --> 01:06:33.855
Then it's my shift.

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:35.774
You have a concussion.

01:06:36.655 --> 01:06:39.951
So, the two of you,
just plan to...

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:41.423
take it easy for a while.

01:06:41.424 --> 01:06:42.471
Bo,

01:06:42.472 --> 01:06:44.294
we got it covered this once.

01:06:44.624 --> 01:06:46.649
About time all the people
you helped over the years

01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.289
had a chance
to give you a hand.

01:06:48.788 --> 01:06:50.811
There's a whole crew
of guys out there with chainsaws

01:06:50.812 --> 01:06:54.183
clearing trees and branches
off the roads right now.

01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:57.615
Your granddad's got
a lot of friends.

01:07:02.408 --> 01:07:04.388
The good Lord was looking out for you.

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.924
Him and Tucker.

01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:10.534
- Where is Tucker?
- He's with Frank.

01:07:11.645 --> 01:07:14.232
Look, we're more than thankful
that you're safe, George,

01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:18.823
but that doesn't change the fact
of what happened before.

01:07:18.824 --> 01:07:20.807
The dog belongs to Thorne.

01:07:24.288 --> 01:07:26.750
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

01:07:40.838 --> 01:07:43.047
- Mom!
- Hi.

01:07:43.662 --> 01:07:46.672
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

01:07:47.177 --> 01:07:49.095
Oh, look at you.

01:07:49.342 --> 01:07:52.087
- You've gotten older.
- You haven't.

01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:55.906
- How's your head?
- Kinda sore.

01:07:55.908 --> 01:07:57.292
I bet.

01:07:57.918 --> 01:07:59.757
Tucker saved my life.

01:07:59.758 --> 01:08:01.257
I heard.

01:08:02.028 --> 01:08:03.693
Come here.

01:08:05.772 --> 01:08:08.650
Well, I'm glad to see that knock on
your head didn't destroy your appetite.

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:11.336
How many weeks has it been
since you've eaten?

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:15.757
Well, it hadn't been weeks, but he
did sleep most of the last 36 hours.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.814
I'm guessing I'd be hungry too.
[Sisters laughing]

01:08:18.816 --> 01:08:20.491
We are glad you're
feeling better too.

01:08:20.492 --> 01:08:24.680
Oh, I am indeed, and especially
now that you all are here.

01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:30.653
George, when you're finished eating,
if you're feeling up to it, uh,

01:08:30.654 --> 01:08:33.180
I think we got something
we need to do.

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:38.377
George,

01:08:38.377 --> 01:08:41.032
I know how much
you wanted Tucker,

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:44.296
and what he meant to you--
what he means to you--

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.435
And I'm sorry he had
to go back to Thorne,

01:08:48.009 --> 01:08:52.859
But if there's anything
I want you to grow up to be,

01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:56.986
it's a man of character,
and what you did was wrong.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.921
I know, Grandpa,

01:08:58.923 --> 01:09:01.225
and I'm sorry I let you down.

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:07.448
I know we've never talked much
about your dad,

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:10.584
but he made his dad very proud,

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:17.568
and I know he'd feel the same
about you, just like I do.

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:25.718
Where are we going?

01:09:26.243 --> 01:09:28.510
To see Tom Turner.

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:30.622
You want to threaten me,
Turner? You go ahead.

01:09:30.622 --> 01:09:34.497
Now, you ever threaten a McCray again,
or anyone else, for that matter,

01:09:34.497 --> 01:09:36.582
you're dealing with me.

01:09:36.582 --> 01:09:39.136
Do we understand each other?

01:09:42.004 --> 01:09:45.919
[Man:] <i>I was just glad Grandpa never
used that tone of voice on me.</i>

01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:48.087
<i>I knew he was tough,</i>

01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:49.966
<i>but not that tough.</i>

01:10:00.319 --> 01:10:03.197
<i>That was one of the best
Christmas Eves I can remember.</i>

01:10:04.563 --> 01:10:07.927
<i>For sure it felt
like something was missing,</i>

01:10:07.928 --> 01:10:09.923
<i>but it was also like doing
a jigsaw puzzle</i>

01:10:09.924 --> 01:10:12.403
<i>when you can just start
to see the finished picture</i>

01:10:12.404 --> 01:10:15.338
<i>forming out of a bunch
of jagged pieces.</i>

01:10:15.937 --> 01:10:17.280
Grace?

01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:22.728
[Man:] <i>We had all dealt with the loss of my dad
differently over the past six months,</i>

01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:26.155
<i>and we had all done our best
to move forward in our own way.</i>

01:10:26.156 --> 01:10:28.314
Dear Lord, we thank you
for bringing this family...

01:10:28.315 --> 01:10:30.548
[Man:] <i>But we had also all been
afraid being together</i>

01:10:30.549 --> 01:10:34.655
<i>at Christmas without my dad
might make us feel worse again,</i>

01:10:34.656 --> 01:10:39.248
<i>afraid that numbing pain we'd all just
gotten through was gonna come back.</i>

01:10:40.106 --> 01:10:43.265
<i>But being together had
the exact opposite effect.</i>

01:10:45.273 --> 01:10:48.755
<i>We all felt like we were part
of something bigger again.</i>

01:10:49.784 --> 01:10:52.740
...and for that, dear Lord,
we thank you.

01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:54.403
[All:] Amen.

01:11:01.404 --> 01:11:02.841
[George:]
And so, I go to pet the dog...

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.830
[Man:] <i>We were reminded
that we were a family</i>

01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:09.421
<i>that could never be torn apart by any loss
as long as we were there for each other...</i>

01:11:09.422 --> 01:11:12.953
[George:] ...and he said,
"It's my dog". [Laughing]

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:15.919
[Man:] <i>...to carry on.</i>

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.678
[Laughing]

01:11:20.463 --> 01:11:22.246
Funny boy.

01:11:22.247 --> 01:11:24.838
[Talking and laughing]

01:11:27.396 --> 01:11:28.922
[Knocking on door]

01:11:30.836 --> 01:11:32.600
- Frank.
- [George:] Tucker!

01:11:32.601 --> 01:11:34.160
[Barking]

01:11:34.161 --> 01:11:36.106
Frank, come on in.

01:11:37.743 --> 01:11:39.957
Hi, Frank. Merry Christmas.

01:11:39.958 --> 01:11:41.175
Jill.

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:43.126
Merry Christmas to you.

01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:45.377
I don't want to bother you...

01:11:45.378 --> 01:11:46.931
You're not bothering us.

01:11:46.932 --> 01:11:49.649
Heavens! You've just arrived
in time for leftovers.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.135
Oh, no.

01:11:51.136 --> 01:11:54.281
You've got a house full of people. I'm sure
the leftovers will get eaten around here.

01:11:54.282 --> 01:11:58.144
There's plenty.
Besides, I made extra.

01:11:58.573 --> 01:12:00.731
Really, I don't want
to interrupt.

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:04.116
I just wanted to come by
and give George something.

01:12:04.117 --> 01:12:06.351
Something for me?

01:12:07.604 --> 01:12:09.838
I want you to have Tucker.

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.891
You what?

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.183
Well...

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:19.933
I got a new job, and it's gonna
require me to do a lot of travelling

01:12:19.934 --> 01:12:22.943
for long stretches, and, well,

01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:26.139
you'd be doing me a favour
if you'd take Tucker for me.

01:12:28.256 --> 01:12:31.838
[Man:] <i>Just when I thought a day
couldn't get any better,</i>

01:12:31.839 --> 01:12:33.473
<i>it got better.</i>

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.777
Yeah. I mean...

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:39.985
- I love Tucker.
- That's very gracious of you, Frank.

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.165
Well,

01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:44.691
you've done so much for me.

01:12:44.692 --> 01:12:47.041
And George has been
a part of that.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:48.662
Thank you, Frank.

01:12:49.726 --> 01:12:52.431
I know we don't know each other
very well, but...

01:12:52.432 --> 01:12:55.031
John always considered
you a friend,

01:12:55.032 --> 01:12:57.398
and he didn't just mean
when you were young.

01:12:57.702 --> 01:12:58.962
Thank you.

01:12:58.963 --> 01:13:01.189
I appreciate you saying that.

01:13:03.015 --> 01:13:05.136
You don't beat yourself up, huh?

01:13:05.426 --> 01:13:08.267
We all make mistakes
now and then.

01:13:08.816 --> 01:13:10.435
Your daddy and me, uh,

01:13:10.436 --> 01:13:13.623
started down a road
and got into some things,

01:13:13.624 --> 01:13:16.435
but he saw where we were headed,
and he stopped,

01:13:16.436 --> 01:13:20.460
but I didn't, and I resented him

01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:22.604
for being better than me.

01:13:23.295 --> 01:13:27.819
But now I understand I was just
hating myself for who I'd become.

01:13:29.602 --> 01:13:31.442
But not anymore.

01:13:32.961 --> 01:13:36.420
This family has shown me
what kindness can do,

01:13:36.421 --> 01:13:41.127
and because of you, I've got a chance
to change things in my life now.

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:46.379
That's why I want you
to have Tucker.

01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:53.435
[Frank and Cora chuckling]

01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:01.158
George,

01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:04.422
why don't you give Frank
his present?

01:14:06.139 --> 01:14:08.243
Grandma and I picked it out.

01:14:11.344 --> 01:14:13.839
Go ahead, open it up.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.580
We saw that the other frame was
broken, so...

01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:23.324
Thank you.

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.755
This means a lot to me.

01:14:26.273 --> 01:14:28.358
It means a lot to us too--

01:14:29.186 --> 01:14:31.892
you know, to have a picture of Dad
and his friend in your house.

01:14:32.216 --> 01:14:36.534
And since we're all in this gift-giving
mood here on Christmas Eve,

01:14:37.103 --> 01:14:38.725
one more for you.

01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:41.684
He made it himself.

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:56.249
So, I guess someone was
in on the surprise.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:59.895
Yeah, when Frank told me
yesterday what he wanted to do,

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.509
I thought it was mighty
fine of him to do it.

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:05.172
Bo asked me what I thought
about the name Tucker, and, uh,

01:15:05.173 --> 01:15:08.830
I told him I thought
it was the right name.

01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:13.469
Aw!
[Laughing]

01:15:32.292 --> 01:15:34.339
Oh, Merry Christmas.
[Kiss]

01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:37.033
Merry Christmas.

01:15:37.905 --> 01:15:39.110
What are you doing up?

01:15:39.111 --> 01:15:41.636
Oh, well, I thought
I'd give you a hand milking.

01:15:42.394 --> 01:15:46.552
I'd done it a time or two, you know.
I was married to a dairy farmer.

01:15:47.223 --> 01:15:52.066
And he would be very impressed to see
his grownup boy taking over for him.

01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:56.094
Mom, can I talk to you
about Minnesota?

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:00.570
Yeah, sure. Of course.

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.765
What would you say
if I said that...

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:15.810
I was thinking maybe...

01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:18.629
that instead of moving
to Minnesota,

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:21.445
I should stay here
with Grandma and Grandpa?

01:16:22.718 --> 01:16:25.973
I guess you've been thinking
about all this.

01:16:25.974 --> 01:16:28.349
I think they need me here.

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.700
And maybe you need to be here,

01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:32.939
where you can feel closer
to your dad.

01:16:33.486 --> 01:16:34.954
Yeah.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.748
I like it here.

01:16:36.749 --> 01:16:39.946
But... I also miss you.

01:16:43.531 --> 01:16:46.186
When your dad had
his accident...

01:16:48.878 --> 01:16:51.285
...I had to get away from here.

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:56.712
Everywhere I looked,
all I could see was him.

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:02.430
The reminders were...
too painful.

01:17:04.134 --> 01:17:07.716
But something you said,
it got me thinking.

01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:13.045
We need to deal with things head-on,

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:16.806
and now that I'm back,
I realized I...

01:17:16.807 --> 01:17:19.230
I can't run away,

01:17:19.231 --> 01:17:22.289
and we're not supposed
to run away;

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:24.912
we're... we're supposed
to get through it

01:17:24.913 --> 01:17:26.895
with the ones we love.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:32.151
So that's why I'm thinking...

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:34.551
about moving back here.

01:17:37.349 --> 01:17:38.963
What?

01:17:38.964 --> 01:17:41.170
This is where I belong too.

01:17:42.574 --> 01:17:45.516
I feel closer to him here,
just like you do.

01:17:47.923 --> 01:17:49.904
And I like that now.

01:17:51.484 --> 01:17:53.022
Wow.

01:17:55.414 --> 01:17:57.231
But... what about
Trisha and Hannah?

01:17:57.232 --> 01:18:00.392
Oh, they're in college;
they're supposed to be on their own.

01:18:00.393 --> 01:18:02.755
They don't need me in Minnesota.

01:18:03.062 --> 01:18:06.058
Not that you need me;

01:18:06.059 --> 01:18:08.028
I... I know that you're
growing up too.

01:18:08.029 --> 01:18:11.501
Well, I might be growing up, but...

01:18:11.502 --> 01:18:13.964
I'm not sure I'm all the way there yet.

01:18:15.215 --> 01:18:17.869
And I know I'd like you here.

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.844
- Hi, Mary Ann.
- Hello. Merry Christmas.

01:18:29.845 --> 01:18:33.107
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:35.327
Thank you so much
for calling me, Mrs. McCray.

01:18:35.328 --> 01:18:36.881
I wouldn't have wanted
to miss this.

01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:41.145
Oh, well, since it was you who started this,
I figured it was the least I could do.

01:18:41.146 --> 01:18:44.298
Uh, OK, I'd like everybody's
attention, please.

01:18:44.618 --> 01:18:47.056
Now, as you all know,

01:18:47.057 --> 01:18:49.822
because of all the snow
and ice days,

01:18:49.823 --> 01:18:53.017
the school's Christmas play had
to be cancelled this year.

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:56.790
Well, I went to a lot of trouble
to make a beautiful suit,

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:59.514
and I'll be darned if I'm gonna
let it go to waste,

01:18:59.515 --> 01:19:04.133
so we have a visitor
this Christmas morning.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.184
Ho, ho, ho!
[Clapping]

01:19:07.185 --> 01:19:08.362
Merry Christmas!

01:19:08.363 --> 01:19:10.127
Ho, ho, ho!

01:19:11.108 --> 01:19:12.402
Hi, Tucker!

01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:15.841
[Man:] <i>And yes, even with all we'd
gone through,</i>

01:19:15.842 --> 01:19:19.009
<i>it was a very
merry Christmas indeed.</i>

01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.312
Looking good, McCray--
or Nick.

01:19:21.993 --> 01:19:24.449
And I hope some of you
children aren't disappointed

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:26.601
when you find coal in
your stockings this year.

01:19:26.602 --> 01:19:28.202
The real Santa would never say that.

01:19:28.203 --> 01:19:29.880
[Bo:] She's right.

01:19:29.881 --> 01:19:31.649
[Laughing]

01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:36.444
Hey.

01:19:36.445 --> 01:19:37.969
Merry Christmas, Grandpa.

01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:39.189
Merry Christmas, George.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.884
You are spoiled this year.

01:19:40.885 --> 01:19:42.823
[Camera click]

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:44.780
[Camera click]

01:19:46.979 --> 01:19:48.929
[Laughing]

01:19:50.816 --> 01:19:52.899
[Man:] <i>And as I look back on that time,</i>

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.426
<i>of course I'm aware
there was pain.</i>

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.878
<i>But thankfully,</i>

01:19:57.879 --> 01:20:00.054
<i>I mostly remember the joy.</i>

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:06.100
<i>Tucker's been my friend now
for 10 years.</i>

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.295
<i>He's still the best Christmas
present I've ever had.</i>

01:20:09.296 --> 01:20:12.843
<i>I think of Frank Thorne often
and see him on occasion.</i>

01:20:12.844 --> 01:20:15.793
<i>He comes to visit Tucker
when we're all in the area.</i>

01:20:15.794 --> 01:20:19.989
<i>I'm very happy to report my
dad's old friend is doing well.</i>

01:20:20.894 --> 01:20:24.947
<i>I must say, this Christmas season is
shaping up to be pretty special too.</i>

01:20:24.948 --> 01:20:27.774
<i>First, college graduation,
and then moving back here</i>

01:20:27.775 --> 01:20:30.498
<i>to officially take over
the McCray farm--</i>

01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:33.121
<i>two rather substantial events.</i>

01:20:33.523 --> 01:20:36.616
<i>But maybe not the biggest
events of the year.</i>

01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:40.039
<i>Yep, that's Mary Ann,
my old bus-riding partner.</i>

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:44.381
<i>And yes, we got engaged
last night.</i>

01:20:50.536 --> 01:20:52.390
You did good, McCray.

01:20:53.829 --> 01:20:56.595
[Man:] <i>Tucker seems to be fine
with my choice too.</i>

01:20:56.596 --> 01:20:58.242
<i>That was important to me.</i>

01:20:58.243 --> 01:21:00.353
Look what I found in my bedroom.

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.104
- Ohhh!
- Yeah.

01:21:02.105 --> 01:21:04.420
Which one of you lost this? Huh?

01:21:04.421 --> 01:21:07.299
[Man:] <i>Turns out Hannah's family
is ready for a dog.</i>

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:10.499
<i>I suspect, for the kids,
the puppy trumps the ring.</i>

01:21:15.205 --> 01:21:18.145
- Look at this one.
- Look what I have.

01:21:18.146 --> 01:21:22.144
[Man:] <i>Trisha couldn't come up with any reason
her family shouldn't have a little Tucker too.</i>

01:21:22.401 --> 01:21:23.360
[Whining]

01:21:23.384 --> 01:21:24.343
Darling.

01:21:28.097 --> 01:21:30.113
They are so sweet.

01:21:30.114 --> 01:21:31.839
They're so sleepy.

01:21:33.396 --> 01:21:36.570
[Others laughing]

01:21:53.003 --> 01:21:55.433
Hey, everybody,
look at the camera.

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:05.343
Aww.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:11.227
[Man:] <i>We'll see how Tucker does
with his cousins.</i>

01:22:11.228 --> 01:22:12.417
<i>Who knows?</i>

01:22:12.418 --> 01:22:14.979
<i>Maybe we need a puppy
around here too,</i>

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.866
<i>to keep Tuck young.</i>

01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:20.381
<i>I'll let you know
Tucker's decision next year.</i>

01:22:20.967 --> 01:22:24.835
<i>Until then,
from our family to yours,</i>

01:22:24.836 --> 01:22:26.377
<i>merry Christmas.</i>

01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:27.402
[Bark]

01:22:49.751 --> 01:22:51.250
The End
