In Koh Hansu's absence,everything is chaos.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.575
Isn't he due back by now?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.493
I thought he was going to be gone a week.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.786
That's right.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.874
And now it's hard to say.He may never return at all.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.001
Why do you say that?

07:39.084 --> 07:42.671
A man like Koh Hansu, he has options.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.383
Being a fish broker in Busanisn't that man's ultimate dream.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.263
Going back to the way things were,I couldn't take it.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.892
He may have been strict,but he paid fairly.

How about here?She'd be with these memories.

How can you say that?

09:08.632 --> 09:11.093
Of course I have to comesee how you're faring.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.888
[inhales sharply] This is Pastor Rhee,he's here visiting from Korea.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.599
To have him here is so very lucky.

09:17.683 --> 09:21.061
He'll be here with us for a few months,staying at the church.

[Pastor Rhee] Our Kyunghee,

09:28.485 --> 09:31.989
I didn't know her long,but I could tell she was a rare person.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.909
Would it be right to sayshe loved to bring joy to others?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.328
I only wish you could have met her

09:38.412 --> 09:41.248
before all her energywas stolen by her cancer.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.960
[inhales]Well, she might have been an old woman,

09:45.043 --> 09:48.046
but I'm sure you would havefallen for her anyway.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.339
[chuckles]

09:50.591 --> 09:54.219
I was able to look into her heart,and I saw a good person.

09:55.637 --> 09:59.808
And that's all we everreally need to see, isn't it?

09:59.892 --> 10:01.560
Oh my. Oh my.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.687
You speak so well.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.648
You could write a book one day.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.363
-Do you mind if I move this?-No, go right ahead.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.587
[Pastor Rhee]She should be with loved ones.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.672
Oh yes, right. That is much better.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800

11:40.492 --> 11:43.328
We were beginning to thinkyou had forsaken us.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.247
You had us so worried!

11:46.123 --> 11:49.835
Did you forget all about us?[Jiyun continuing indistinctly]

12:28.040 --> 12:29.917

12:30.501 --> 12:32.336
It's too pretty to rip open.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.797
You're too sentimental about things.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.716
I'm with child.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.228
You must say something.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.107
Are you sure?

[Sunja]There's no way to know it's a boy.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.835
But I do know it.

13:54.918 --> 13:55.961
I'm certain.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.425
[Sunja] Then you'll be disappointedif it's a girl. [Sunja] Then you'll be disappointedif it's a girl.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.343
But you'll still have to love her.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.139
If it's a girl,I'll buy her pretty dresses.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.933
And hope she's as smart as her mother.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.605
[both chuckle]

14:18.108 --> 14:20.736
-[sighs]-Then when will you visit my mother?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.739
She'll be surprised, naturally.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.450
But if we marry quickly,she'll be reassured.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.620
Why all this sudden talk about marriage?

14:30.412 --> 14:32.247
I thought you knew what this was.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.375
Knew what?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.837
What… What do you mean?

14:40.589 --> 14:41.924
I can't marry you.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.217
I have a family.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.516
In Osaka, I have a wifeand three daughters.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.353
It's not exactly a marriage of love…

14:54.436 --> 14:57.147
-[thunder rumbles]-… but it's a necessary arrangement.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.191
"Necessary"? Why's that?

14:59.274 --> 15:03.111
Necessary for business reasons.There's no affection. Necessary for business reasons.There's no affection.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.115
You and your mother…

15:07.908 --> 15:11.078
… and our child will have everythingyou would ever want.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.997
I'll buy the biggest house in Yeongdo.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.666
How about Jiyun's home?

15:16.166 --> 15:18.585
They'll no longer be ableto afford it anyway.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.506
You'll learn how to read

15:22.589 --> 15:24.216
and learn how to tell time.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.511
We'll have more children,and we'll live well.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.012
Even more daughters.

16:09.303 --> 16:12.931
Marriage, it's just an arrangement.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.977
You will see the reason in what I propose.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.105
What are you saying?

16:21.315 --> 16:23.066
It is how we survive.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.862
And it is the only way for people like us.

16:52.596 --> 16:53.805
So then…

16:55.557 --> 16:57.768
Was this the plan from the start?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.189
To force me into marrying you…

17:03.148 --> 17:04.900
… since nobody else will?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.484
[sniffs]

17:06.568 --> 17:10.113
After all, who would riskmarrying the daughter of a cripple--

17:10.739 --> 17:12.699
I will not let you speak of my father--

17:12.782 --> 17:15.410
My child could inherityour father's deformities.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.246
I have a right to say it.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.832
So who's putting a curse on who?Will you tell me that?

17:29.299 --> 17:30.133

Including this very house.

I was barely ableto be a mother in those days.

20:35.110 --> 20:40.741
I was working 14 hours a day,every single day of the week.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.502
Don't push yourself so much now.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.212
You should be taking it easy.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.005
Oh please.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.425
You make it sound like this kindof living is difficult or something.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.387
Enough. Go back to work. Enough. Go back to work.

21:02.471 --> 21:05.307

You don't have to worry.

They know my situation.

Besides, there's nothing to be done.

The landowner turned our offer down again.

21:18.946 --> 21:21.782
What? All that money?

21:22.366 --> 21:26.537
Can you imagine all she could providefor her children with that?

21:26.620 --> 21:29.039
It's not like it's dirty money.

21:30.374 --> 21:33.126
Oh, that womanhas something wrong with her.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.341
So how does that affect you?

21:41.677 --> 21:44.304
I'll wear the black markof this for a while.

21:47.641 --> 21:49.476
But then I'll claw my way back.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.854
That's the only choice I have left.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.148
Either way, that deal is lost.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.614
[sighs] I wish I could comprehend [sighs] I wish I could comprehend

22:02.698 --> 22:06.535
why people hold on to the past like that.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.830
What earthly good does it do?

22:10.998 --> 22:15.002
[clicks tongue]It doesn't bring the dead back, does it?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.464
Grandma.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.302
Come to Tokyo with me.

22:23.802 --> 22:24.928
What?

22:25.012 --> 22:27.055
You should be the one to talk to her.

22:27.681 --> 22:28.682
Me?

22:29.266 --> 22:31.393
What could I possibly say to her?

22:32.352 --> 22:34.188
What you told me just now.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.983
About how someone's houseis just a roof and some walls.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.944
And how you can't bring back the dead.

22:43.155 --> 22:45.574
Grandma, please.

22:59.630 --> 23:02.299
[Donghee] Well? What are they saying? [Donghee] Well? What are they saying?

23:02.382 --> 23:03.634
Can you hear anything?

23:11.475 --> 23:13.477
What's going on? Will he live or not?

23:17.648 --> 23:20.234
[pharmacist]He's contended with this before.

23:21.235 --> 23:24.446
Death, it seems,has already branded him once.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.866
[sighs]It's a pity he's so far from his family.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.661
I wonder if his parents are still alive.

23:32.538 --> 23:34.331
-Is that his case?-Yes.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.085
Let's see if we can find a name.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.177
-All expensive clothing.-Oh…

23:47.261 --> 23:48.679
Look at all these books!

23:49.304 --> 23:51.765
How hard it must've beento carry such a load.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.401
What does this say?

24:09.783 --> 24:12.077
"Dear Mother and Father,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.580
"I have arrived safely in Busan.

24:15.247 --> 24:19.376
"I can't wait to get to Osakaso I can do the Good Lord's work

24:19.459 --> 24:23.881
"and so I can start my new lifewith Yoseb and Kyunghee."

24:24.965 --> 24:27.050
"Do not worry about me.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.844
"I am well.

24:29.595 --> 24:32.222
"Your loving son, Isak."

24:33.473 --> 24:35.517
Isak? What kind of name is that?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.854
I believe it's some sort of biblical name.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.398
Look, he's from Pyongyang.

24:42.441 --> 24:45.944
[sighs]Then he's a Christian from the North.

24:49.198 --> 24:52.284
You can't make light of his illness.It's tuberculosis.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.077
We must report it.

24:55.746 --> 24:58.832
-I can't just kick him out of the house.-Ma'am…

25:01.418 --> 25:05.422
Consider your daughter's healthand that of your boarders.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.593
Let's wait.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.680
We'll see if he survives the night.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.231
[knocks]

25:27.819 --> 25:30.447
-[Solomon] Hello.-What are you doing back here?

25:31.156 --> 25:31.990
And who is this?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.618
Sorry for the disturbance.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.328
I'm his grandmother.

25:36.411 --> 25:39.331
Could you spare a few minutes?We'd like to speak to you.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.624
[sighs]

25:47.089 --> 25:50.259
[Sunja stammers]Please, don't trouble yourself--

25:50.342 --> 25:52.803
-[Solomon] Thank you.-[Geumja] It's nothing.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.513
I was just about to eat.

25:59.268 --> 26:00.477
-Amen.-Amen. -Amen.-Amen.

26:05.524 --> 26:08.861
Oh, is there a grandchild here?

26:08.944 --> 26:10.612
[chuckles] Oh, those?

26:10.696 --> 26:12.906
I'm the one who's studying.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.199
[Sunja gasps]

26:23.625 --> 26:25.878
Look, my school just gave me this.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.881
My diploma for finishing sixth grade.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.049
[exclaims] Well now!

26:31.633 --> 26:35.053
So you really go to schoolwith all the children?

26:35.137 --> 26:36.138
Yes.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.432
And mostly they're good kids,

26:38.515 --> 26:41.059
though there are a few hard cases.[chuckles]

26:41.143 --> 26:44.980
[gasps]And what led you to decide to do that?

26:45.856 --> 26:49.943
I don't know how it was for you.We were poor when I was young.

26:50.027 --> 26:53.447
And there was no moneyfor even the boys to go to school.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.908
[Sunja] I know it, and my own mother

26:55.991 --> 26:58.827
could never see the pointin sending girls to classes.

26:59.453 --> 27:01.496
Well then, you understand. Well then, you understand.

27:01.580 --> 27:05.792
That feeling of being closed off,separate from the world.

27:06.710 --> 27:10.214
I was embarrassed or afraid every day.

27:10.297 --> 27:14.134
And then, I found myself getting angryat my children for learning to read.

27:15.511 --> 27:17.471
Worried they'd look down on me.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.934
But look, I was number three in my class!

27:22.017 --> 27:25.103
-Almost number two!-[gasps] Wow!

27:38.534 --> 27:40.244
You can taste it, yeah?

27:40.327 --> 27:41.745
[sighs]

27:42.746 --> 27:43.956
How could it…

27:44.706 --> 27:48.377
A woman I know visits her daughterevery couple of months.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.838
She comes back with two whole suitcases.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.257
Grandma, what is it?

27:53.340 --> 27:54.967
Taste the rice again.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.059
Will you look at that!

28:04.142 --> 28:07.354
Nobody of his ageknows the difference any more.

28:08.272 --> 28:10.190
This is rice grown in our country.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.694
-How do you know?-It's nuttier.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.613
A bit sweeter,and a little harder to chew.

28:18.031 --> 28:20.617
In the day,white rice became a luxury for us.

28:21.201 --> 28:24.246
We were the ones who grew it,then they come and take it.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.709
And now we eat white rice with every meal,

28:28.792 --> 28:30.752
but barely even notice it any more.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.381
And you think that's a good thing?

28:42.514 --> 28:44.349
When I first arrived here…

28:45.142 --> 28:46.768
… we had so little money.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.272
We were in Osaka then as well.

28:51.356 --> 28:54.610
Near the train station,where food stalls are, I remember…

28:55.110 --> 28:58.947
I'd go strolling, trying to imaginewhat each dish tasted like.

29:00.282 --> 29:03.035
And after a while,I guess I got good at it.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.746
Each smell would actuallyget my mouth watering.

29:06.538 --> 29:09.374
[Geumja]Like the first time I smelled coffee.

29:09.958 --> 29:15.005
[inhales deeply] I thought it was the mostwonderful smell that ever existed.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.882
My first taste of it came years later--

29:16.965 --> 29:19.468
Yuck! I know!It tasted so bitter! [chuckles]

29:19.551 --> 29:21.261
[chuckles] Yes! You know!

29:21.345 --> 29:23.639
Not at all what I imaginedit would taste like.

29:23.722 --> 29:25.390
[both women chuckle]

29:32.105 --> 29:35.734
But nowadays, I don't even get hungry.

29:36.318 --> 29:37.528
I eat when it's time.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.199
I no longer make my own kimchi.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.410
I buy it in jars for 300 yen.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.372
[sighs]

29:50.457 --> 29:56.463
I would've had to sell my whole cartin order to make 300 yen… [chuckles]

30:01.385 --> 30:03.220
This rice evokes memories.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.973
Memories of my mother.

30:07.182 --> 30:09.017
And of my wedding day.

30:10.936 --> 30:11.770
[chuckles]

30:13.438 --> 30:15.274
[sniffles]

30:17.109 --> 30:19.736
Grandma, what is it?

30:19.820 --> 30:21.822
-[sniffles]-Grandma?

30:23.282 --> 30:25.659
I'm just… I'm being so silly.

30:26.952 --> 30:28.579
I'm sorry. Coming was a mistake--

30:28.662 --> 30:30.873
Her tears mustn't be disrespected.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.876
She has earned this right to cry.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.047
[sobbing]

30:45.470 --> 30:48.473
[sniffling, sighs]

31:15.626 --> 31:17.878
[breathing deeply]

31:17.961 --> 31:20.047
[Sunja's mother]I know you do not know me…

31:23.884 --> 31:25.093
But don't be worried.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.263
I'll do my best to care for you.

31:33.936 --> 31:35.479
[sighs]

31:38.774 --> 31:40.609
[Sunja] Have you returned home?

31:41.485 --> 31:43.278
Two times, I returned.

31:43.362 --> 31:46.448
In the '70s, I went back,and recently I went back.

31:47.074 --> 31:48.200
And you?

31:48.283 --> 31:49.701
[sighs]

31:50.702 --> 31:53.205
We had no money to go back at first.

31:53.288 --> 31:56.291
Then later, it was time I couldn't spare.

31:57.543 --> 31:59.545
Now there's no point to it.

31:59.628 --> 32:02.589
According to what they say,it's all gone, isn't it? According to what they say,it's all gone, isn't it?

32:04.007 --> 32:06.844
Yes, much has changed, it's true.

32:08.345 --> 32:12.015
Still, just the smell of familiar food…

32:12.766 --> 32:14.977
The sound of your own language…

32:15.519 --> 32:17.938
The ground beneath your feetfeels different.

32:19.857 --> 32:24.319
It's palpable, you close your eyes…[sighs]

32:24.403 --> 32:27.322
… and then inside, you just realize that

32:27.406 --> 32:31.243
this land is in your blood,it's home to you.

32:32.828 --> 32:35.038
That's the reason for us to go.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.879
I lost my…

32:42.671 --> 32:45.924
I lost my sister-in-law.It's only been a few days.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.179
She really was such a good person.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.349
She yearned for so much more,

32:54.433 --> 32:57.436
yet she always triedto put our interests above hers.

33:00.606 --> 33:02.024
My sister-in-law…

33:02.941 --> 33:04.568
My sister-in-law…

33:05.152 --> 33:07.613
If only she could havegone back once more.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.782
How much joy it would've brought her.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.701
[sobs]

33:14.953 --> 33:16.371
And now…

33:17.873 --> 33:21.293
Now it's too late. [sobs]

33:24.254 --> 33:27.758
[Geumja] It's not too late for you.

33:29.676 --> 33:31.303
Am I right?

33:40.354 --> 33:41.188
You.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.858
You're not even curious about your land.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.152
You thought if you broughtyour grandmother,

33:47.236 --> 33:49.446
I'd be convinced that I should sell?

33:52.658 --> 33:53.909
Yes.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.289
You really are shameless, aren't you?

34:00.624 --> 34:02.793
How can you even sleep at night?

34:04.253 --> 34:06.088
I'm not attempting to steal from you.

34:06.171 --> 34:08.715
We're not taking advantage.We're offering a fortune.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.303
But instead of being grateful,

34:13.387 --> 34:16.389
you act like everyone's tryingto cause you some injustice.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.143
Times have changed.

34:21.478 --> 34:24.690
Now they're the oneswho are accountable to us.

34:28.193 --> 34:29.610
I ask you…

34:30.320 --> 34:32.906
Do you really believe that?

34:34.616 --> 34:35.826
[in Japanese] Yes.

35:20.287 --> 35:21.496
[Sunja] Mother…

35:22.581 --> 35:24.249
His fever finally broke.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.835
We should make porridge.

35:27.377 --> 35:28.795
Mother…

35:32.132 --> 35:34.134
I must speak with you.

35:36.595 --> 35:37.596
What?

35:39.223 --> 35:40.641
[breathes sharply]

35:44.102 --> 35:45.312
[sniffling]

35:45.979 --> 35:47.397
Who did this?

35:49.983 --> 35:51.985
-[whimpers]-Tell me his name!

35:55.280 --> 35:57.199
[sniffling]

35:57.282 --> 35:58.450
Tell me.

35:58.951 --> 36:01.828
You need to say if he forced you. Did he? You need to say if he forced you. Did he?

36:03.747 --> 36:04.957
No, he didn't.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.837
-That's not how it was---Then what are you protecting him for?

36:09.920 --> 36:11.505
[whimpering, sniffling]

36:11.588 --> 36:15.509
What kind of coward does thisand refuses to own up to it?

36:26.979 --> 36:31.191
It is all my fault,thinking you were such a sensible girl.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.863
Really? How could you be so stupid?

36:40.117 --> 36:41.118
Mother…

36:44.204 --> 36:46.039
I'm so sorry.

37:05.225 --> 37:07.227
You know what this means for you now.

37:10.397 --> 37:11.565
For your child.

37:15.485 --> 37:16.695
Do you know?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.960
Sunja… [sniffles]

37:34.338 --> 37:37.174
Tell me, is there no wayto get him to marry you now?

37:37.257 --> 37:38.634
[Sunja sobbing]

37:41.386 --> 37:45.390
It's done, Mother. It's over.

37:47.434 --> 37:48.852
He's gone.

37:53.148 --> 37:54.775
I was such a fool.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.076
[train passing]

38:04.159 --> 38:05.661
[Sunja] I see it now.

38:07.371 --> 38:10.791
That woman wants to die in that house.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.210
Couldn't you see that?

38:13.293 --> 38:15.254
[Solomon] Her childrenwould benefit from that money.

38:15.337 --> 38:16.964
You said so yourself.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.217
So…

38:20.717 --> 38:23.262
In the end, is that really our lot?

38:23.345 --> 38:25.973
To constantly sacrifice for our children?

38:26.807 --> 38:28.642
And when does it all stop?

38:29.351 --> 38:30.561
At our death? Or what?

38:32.729 --> 38:34.565
What is it you want me to do?

38:35.399 --> 38:37.109
I need you to be very clear.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.949
Couldn't you get to the top of the world

38:44.032 --> 38:46.827
without making so much troublefor that woman?

38:48.161 --> 38:49.371
No, I can't.

38:49.454 --> 38:51.248
[in Japanese] That's the job I do.

38:51.331 --> 38:53.375
That's how I put food on the table.

38:58.505 --> 39:01.925
I'm so sorry that I can't be more likeyour beloved Pastor Rhee. I'm so sorry that I can't be more likeyour beloved Pastor Rhee.

39:02.593 --> 39:05.012
What in the worlddoes that have to do with it?

39:07.431 --> 39:10.392
I once knew someone like him.There's a likeness.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.519
But that's all it is.

39:13.478 --> 39:14.938
[jingle plays on intercom]

39:15.022 --> 39:17.482
I should go or I'll miss the train.

39:17.566 --> 39:18.984
I'll walk you there.

39:23.780 --> 39:26.408
I know you're good and honest at heart.

39:27.284 --> 39:29.244
I brought you up and I did it well.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.080
Stop pecking at your rice!

40:13.163 --> 40:14.998
You know very well it's bad luck.

40:22.256 --> 40:23.841
[Donghee] What is this?

40:24.424 --> 40:26.218
Did someone die or what?

40:26.301 --> 40:28.136
What is going on?

40:28.220 --> 40:30.430
-[thuds under table]-[whispers] What?

40:46.613 --> 40:47.823
Eat.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.871
-[phone ringing]-[typing]

40:54.371 --> 40:55.998
[Tom] Solomon Baek.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.836
I just got a call from her lawyersan hour ago. I just got a call from her lawyersan hour ago.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.257
You did it. [chuckles]

41:05.340 --> 41:07.217
Using your grandmother!

41:07.301 --> 41:08.635
That's brilliant.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.220
Yeah.

41:11.471 --> 41:12.681
[sighs]

41:13.182 --> 41:14.975
[in Japanese] Okay, everybody.

41:15.058 --> 41:18.520
Naomi, Arimoto, you too.We're going to celebrate.

41:18.604 --> 41:21.690
Château Budweisers for everyone! [laughs]

41:21.773 --> 41:23.483
[office staff chatter, clapping]

41:24.318 --> 41:25.861
Congratulations.

41:25.944 --> 41:27.446
Thank you.

41:27.529 --> 41:30.741
I admit, I didn't think you had a chance.

41:31.283 --> 41:32.701
I misjudged you.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.414
Tom is calling for us. Shall we go?

41:38.165 --> 41:39.791
I'll be right there.

41:46.798 --> 41:48.008
[exhales, chuckles]

41:48.091 --> 41:49.718
[phone rings]

41:51.845 --> 41:53.263
Hello?

41:55.557 --> 41:56.975
Hello?

41:57.684 --> 42:01.522
[Hana]Be good and tell me you missed me. [Hana]Be good and tell me you missed me.

42:03.315 --> 42:06.985
-Or at least lie well.-I've been waiting for you to call.

42:07.069 --> 42:08.570
No, you haven't.

42:08.654 --> 42:10.864
I called four times today.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.116
I went home for a few days.

42:13.825 --> 42:14.952
[speaking indistinctly]

42:15.035 --> 42:16.662
[Hana] What is that?

42:16.745 --> 42:18.163
Is that a party there?

42:20.249 --> 42:21.333
[Tom] Solomon!

42:21.416 --> 42:23.335
I closed an important deal.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.753
We're celebrating.

42:24.837 --> 42:27.714
[Hana] Of course you did.

42:28.924 --> 42:33.095
So it seems sending you off to Americawas the right choice after all.

42:33.178 --> 42:35.180
I suppose your wish came true.

42:35.931 --> 42:39.560
But do you ever wonderabout all that's been lost?

42:40.102 --> 42:42.354
You're supposed to be happy for me.

42:42.437 --> 42:43.856
I refuse.

42:44.481 --> 42:46.900
At least I'm honest about it.

42:47.734 --> 42:52.364
No doubt there are thosewho hate you for your success.

42:53.323 --> 42:55.158
[Solomon] When will I see you?

42:55.951 --> 42:59.162
Perhaps you never will. [sighs]

42:59.872 --> 43:01.999
You haven't changed. You haven't changed.

43:02.082 --> 43:04.001
It's pathetic, you and these games.

43:04.084 --> 43:05.377
[chuckles] You're wrong.

43:06.879 --> 43:11.216
I've changed so much.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.719
[Hana coughing]

43:18.223 --> 43:20.851
[coughing continues]

43:23.228 --> 43:25.105
Are you sick?

43:27.649 --> 43:28.901
Hana!

43:34.448 --> 43:35.449
Ma'am?

43:36.366 --> 43:37.576
Ma'am?

43:39.161 --> 43:40.579
How are you feeling now?

43:40.662 --> 43:42.331
[chuckles]

43:42.414 --> 43:44.041
Alive, thanks to you.

43:44.124 --> 43:47.294
[sighs]Our pharmacist said you're healing well.

43:48.837 --> 43:50.255
Relieved to hear it.

43:50.339 --> 43:52.674
My parents will be happyto hear it as well.

43:52.758 --> 43:54.510
-Yes, sure.-I--

43:54.593 --> 43:57.137
I need to go to town and send them a wire.

43:57.221 --> 43:59.139
I'll find a boy to take the message.

43:59.223 --> 44:01.975
[stutters] I'd like to go myself. [stutters] I'd like to go myself.

44:02.059 --> 44:03.852
Err… Try out these legs of mine.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.064
You shouldn't be overdoing it.

44:07.773 --> 44:10.359
I need to get strongerbefore I go to Osaka.

44:10.442 --> 44:11.818
Do you have to go?

44:11.902 --> 44:14.571
I know there's a church waiting for you.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.491
What if you died there? You'd be…

44:18.617 --> 44:20.160
… so far from home.

44:20.911 --> 44:22.871
Several times, I have come close to death.

44:22.955 --> 44:24.373
I know it well.

44:25.332 --> 44:27.459
So death doesn't scare me at all.

44:27.543 --> 44:29.253
Being alive, on the other hand…

44:30.462 --> 44:32.089
… that's the hard part for me.

44:33.507 --> 44:34.508
Uh…

44:35.884 --> 44:38.470
All right.At least let my daughter go with you.

44:38.554 --> 44:39.721
[stutters]

44:39.805 --> 44:43.517
-I don't wish to trouble anyone.-Please, I can't let you go alone.

44:44.226 --> 44:46.854
Just a moment. I'll fetch her.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.439
Sunja!

44:52.526 --> 44:55.153
[Isak]I'm sorry to burden you and your mother.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.781
Let me take you to lunch.

44:59.741 --> 45:02.452
[Sunja sighs] Oh, it's no trouble at all. [Sunja sighs] Oh, it's no trouble at all.

45:02.536 --> 45:05.163
Perhaps there's something at the market.

45:06.123 --> 45:07.583
[stutters]

45:07.666 --> 45:10.210
There's a noodle shop which they say…

45:11.295 --> 45:12.880
… is supposed to be all right.

45:14.006 --> 45:15.799
It's not too far from here.

45:15.883 --> 45:16.967
Oh… [chuckles]

45:17.050 --> 45:19.344
Well, that sounds just wonderful.

45:20.095 --> 45:22.931
Then we can send my cable after lunch.

45:25.726 --> 45:27.561
[Hansu] I told you about this.

45:29.104 --> 45:30.522
[sighs] Get rid of them.

45:30.606 --> 45:32.608
[man] Yes, all right. Right away.

45:33.901 --> 45:35.110
What's this?

45:38.488 --> 45:39.698
Write it down.

45:40.282 --> 45:43.035
I've heard so much about this market.It's magnificent.

45:47.539 --> 45:49.583
[chuckles] And it's so big too.

46:02.262 --> 46:04.056
Please, we should go.

46:12.523 --> 46:15.067
[in Japanese] Enough of this--

46:15.150 --> 46:16.902
-[Tom] Solomon!-No, hey--

46:16.985 --> 46:19.571
Apologies, he will have to call you back.

46:19.655 --> 46:20.656
Don't hang up--

46:20.739 --> 46:22.407
I am your fucking boss.

46:22.491 --> 46:24.284
Get out here and celebrate.

46:24.868 --> 46:25.953
Genius.

46:26.036 --> 46:27.287
[sighs]

46:27.371 --> 46:28.330
[Tom clears throat]

46:28.413 --> 46:29.623
Hey.

46:30.832 --> 46:31.959
[in Japanese] Cheers.

46:32.042 --> 46:34.253
[all] Cheers!

46:40.342 --> 46:42.177
[smacks lips] That is…

46:44.513 --> 46:46.723
[pachinko machines rattling]

47:01.738 --> 47:02.906
What's going on?

47:02.990 --> 47:04.616
[in Japanese]What are you doing here so late?

47:04.700 --> 47:08.787
She just wanted to go back there,to breathe the air of home once more.

47:09.371 --> 47:10.622
All right, slow down.

47:10.706 --> 47:11.915
What's this about?

47:11.999 --> 47:14.918
It's about your aunt.I can't bury her ashes here.

47:15.002 --> 47:17.212
I want to take her back to her land.

47:17.296 --> 47:19.673
And I want to go back, back to my home.

47:31.685 --> 47:34.313
[Sunja]I've never been to a restaurant before.

47:37.065 --> 47:38.650
[in Japanese] That was quick!

47:40.277 --> 47:43.280
[food server]We don't want our customers waiting.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.157
[speaks Japanese]

47:49.578 --> 47:52.289
Where did you learnto speak Japanese like that?

47:52.372 --> 47:56.543
Ah… I had a private tutor as a child.

47:56.627 --> 47:58.045
Shimizu.

47:59.171 --> 48:00.839
We became friends too. We became friends too.

48:00.923 --> 48:02.299
I saw all your books.

48:02.883 --> 48:05.010
You must know so many things.

48:05.093 --> 48:06.637
I'm not so sure about that.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.933
The older I get,the more I see how much I don't know.

48:11.517 --> 48:13.769
Actually, if I'm being honest,

48:13.852 --> 48:16.271
I feel pretty stupid most of the time.

48:17.856 --> 48:20.317
Uh… May I pray with you?

48:27.658 --> 48:31.245
Father, thank you for the bountyin which we're about to partake.

48:32.162 --> 48:34.831
And thank you for watching over us.

48:34.915 --> 48:38.544
We pray you show us the right pathto guide us and protect us.

48:40.003 --> 48:43.340
In the name of Your son, Jesus Christ.Amen.

48:48.345 --> 48:51.348
Sunja, you can open your eyes now.

49:02.442 --> 49:04.945
Mmm. [chuckles]

49:05.028 --> 49:07.030
It's good. [chuckles]

49:17.875 --> 49:21.879
Sunja, I don't wantto be disingenuous any longer.

49:23.589 --> 49:25.591
I know you are with child.

49:30.470 --> 49:33.015
I have no intention of castigating you.

49:33.098 --> 49:34.308
I only…

49:35.434 --> 49:37.644
I only bring it up because you might…

49:38.770 --> 49:41.982
… need to have someoneyou can call your friend about now.

49:43.859 --> 49:45.569
Anyway, if I may…

49:46.570 --> 49:48.113
The child.

49:48.197 --> 49:51.408
Have you thought of offering the childto another family?

49:53.327 --> 49:55.954
[stutters] Perhaps a childless couple.

49:58.290 --> 49:59.875
I know it is difficult, but…

49:59.958 --> 50:02.211
What is the purpose of this talk? What is the purpose of this talk?

50:05.672 --> 50:08.842
Alone, raising a child.Think about what the repercussions--

50:08.926 --> 50:11.762
I have no illusions about my fate.

50:13.722 --> 50:17.935
I know very well that my child and Iwill always be outcasts.

50:18.936 --> 50:20.312
I'll have to leave my home

50:20.395 --> 50:22.648
so that my mother won't be ruined as well.

50:23.607 --> 50:25.234
Of all this, I'm aware.

50:27.945 --> 50:29.363
And yet…

50:30.781 --> 50:31.782
I…

50:33.992 --> 50:37.412
I also know thatI was once loved by an outcast.

50:39.665 --> 50:41.083
He was my father.

50:42.751 --> 50:46.171
It's strange how muchI am thinking of him now.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.717
They all told him thatgetting married and having a family

50:50.801 --> 50:52.302
was out of the question.

50:52.386 --> 50:54.304
Yet, you see I exist.

50:57.015 --> 50:59.434
I'm here even though I shouldn't be.

51:03.730 --> 51:04.940
And now…

51:06.775 --> 51:09.194
And now my child will be here as well.

51:10.279 --> 51:12.322
Even though he shouldn't be.

51:14.533 --> 51:16.285
But he will be loved.

51:19.079 --> 51:21.790
And maybe I'll haveto sacrifice my health,

51:21.874 --> 51:24.835
continue to work on an empty stomach,

51:24.918 --> 51:26.920
until all my fingernails break.

51:27.963 --> 51:29.381
But my child…

51:32.217 --> 51:34.428
… will be taken care of no matter what.

51:37.431 --> 51:39.057
That's my promise to him.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.438
My father…

51:51.069 --> 51:53.697
… made the same promise to mewhen I was born.

52:01.747 --> 52:03.165
So, no. I…

52:06.210 --> 52:07.419
I will not…

52:10.422 --> 52:11.840
… give up my child.

52:18.639 --> 52:20.474
I'm sorry, Sunja.

52:24.228 --> 52:26.813
I was wrong about you. [sighs]

52:29.233 --> 52:33.445
I have been sick for so much of my life.

52:37.407 --> 52:39.826
All there is to learn from books, I know.

52:40.619 --> 52:43.247
But I hardly know anything about people.

52:43.330 --> 52:45.165
[sighs]

52:48.252 --> 52:50.254
Hearing you speak just now…

52:52.422 --> 52:54.091
I am ashamed.

52:54.174 --> 52:56.176
That was not my intention.

52:56.677 --> 52:57.636
No.

52:58.804 --> 53:00.639
Sunja, I am grateful to you. Sunja, I am grateful to you.

53:04.518 --> 53:05.519
Grateful?

53:14.903 --> 53:16.321
And him…

53:18.866 --> 53:20.701
Can you forget this man?

53:33.797 --> 53:35.799
I certainly hope I can.

53:38.385 --> 53:39.970
If so…

53:41.305 --> 53:44.808
If that happens,could you care for another?

53:46.351 --> 53:49.396
[sniffs]It doesn't matter anymore, does it?

53:50.522 --> 53:52.524
No one would take me now.

53:52.608 --> 53:54.193
But if it were possible…

53:58.030 --> 54:00.032
If somebody were to ask… If somebody were to ask…

54:02.326 --> 54:04.953
Could you leave your homefor some faraway land…

54:08.123 --> 54:10.375
If someone asked you to turn the page…

54:12.294 --> 54:13.712
Could you?

54:21.637 --> 54:23.263
You must…

54:25.682 --> 54:26.850
… understand that I'm--

54:26.934 --> 54:28.894
… with someone else's child, I know.

54:29.561 --> 54:31.063
I understand.

54:31.146 --> 54:32.981
And I am asking you whether…

54:33.982 --> 54:35.234
Perhaps…

54:37.861 --> 54:39.696
Given enough time, could you…

54:43.242 --> 54:45.452
… care for somebody new?

55:57.983 --> 55:59.985
