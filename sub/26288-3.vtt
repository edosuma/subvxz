No, you can't have
your old remote back.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.041
Whoo! What a rush!

00:43.304 --> 00:45.784

at these documents.

Effective immediately,

Are you, are you saying
that I can no longer

02:17.876 --> 02:19.443

02:19.487 --> 02:20.488
Not without a warrant
you can't.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.272
Hi. Agent Torres here.

02:22.316 --> 02:25.232
So, uh, Agent McGee, uh,
he pings, like, all the time.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.842
That is like
his superpower.

02:26.885 --> 02:29.714
Not anymore. Supreme Court
just ruled it's illegal.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.368
They're wrong. Right, McGee?

02:31.412 --> 02:34.415
Actually, I kind of get it.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.808
Sometimes privacy outweighs
the need for security.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.682
I'm sorry, what McGee
means to say is the new policy

02:40.725 --> 02:43.250

criminals can get away.

know about this?He's on leave.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.342

Kayla?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.514
Have you seen the newspaper?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.603
Morning, Dad.
You're just in time.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.344
Honey, my newspaper.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.650
I recycled it.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.218
Already? It's only 8:30.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.263
Which means it's time for you
to go back to work.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.612
Today's your first day back.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.269
I thought you'd be
showered by now.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.792
And dressed.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.579
You want something
to go with your coffee?

03:51.622 --> 03:53.581
Yeah, my newspaper.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.583
You are not
getting away that easy.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.106
Yeah, I noticed.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.760
How's the hip today?

03:58.803 --> 04:01.458
It's cranky.Like the rest of you.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.985
Sweetheart, thank you
for breakfast.

04:07.029 --> 04:09.379
That was very thoughtful.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.381
But I've got
physical therapy today.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.949
So, work tomorrow, then?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.429
We'll see.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.958
And right here.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.571
You've, uh, you've never
seen that vehicle before?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.486
No, sir. Whose is it?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.183
Burglars. The neighbors
saw one of them

04:31.227 --> 04:32.576
steal a package off your porch.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.492
And then they... exploded?

04:35.536 --> 04:37.538
The package exploded.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.845
Palmer, what do we...

04:42.456 --> 04:43.979
Got?

04:44.022 --> 04:45.633
Yeah.

04:45.676 --> 04:49.550
Well, we got two victims.
Death was instantaneous.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.943
Both died from blast injuries.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.597
Were you expecting
any deliveries today,

04:53.641 --> 04:54.468
Petty Officer Nicholas?

04:54.511 --> 04:56.992
Maybe.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.602
My wife orders stuff online
all the time.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.169
Well, according
to the delivery company,

05:00.212 --> 05:01.344
it was addressed to you.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.911
Hey, hey, whoa.Let me through.

05:02.954 --> 05:03.912
I'm his wife.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.435
Hey!
Todd.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.524
My darling, are you okay?

05:07.568 --> 05:08.873
I'm fine. I'm okay.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.701
Is that his wife?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.442
Uh, yeah.
It looks like it.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.662
Her name's Sheba.Sheba.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.098
McGee, you know her?

05:16.141 --> 05:17.839
Yeah. You

05:17.882 --> 05:19.623
No. Bishop, do you?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.277
Uh, no.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.496
I'm okay.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.454
McGee.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.326
Sorry, boss.
Uh, her name is Sheba.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.416
She's one of the stars
of the show Real Wives of War.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.418
The reality show?
You watch that?

05:31.461 --> 05:32.810
Well, Delilah does.Mm-hmm.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.116
Uh-huh.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.683
Oh, my God, you know what?

05:35.726 --> 05:37.685
Petty Officer Nicholas
must be Todd.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.470
SHEBA:
How could this happen?

05:40.514 --> 05:42.342
Todd-- he's not
on the show,

05:42.385 --> 05:44.169
but she talks about him
all the time.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.041
Says that she is
the luckiest woman in the world.

05:46.084 --> 05:50.132
Wow. Delilah must, uh,
really like that show.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.351
Yeah.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.656
Okay.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.875
Excuse me, Officer.

05:53.918 --> 05:56.268
Uh, yes.
Sorry, I mean Agent.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.532
I mean, um... what?

05:58.575 --> 06:00.969
Please tell me this isn't real.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.187
Excuse me?

06:02.231 --> 06:05.408
It's sweeps.
Greg put you up to this?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.714
Greg.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.543
My producer.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.153
Hey, Torres.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.460
Uh, no, this is real.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.505
Somebody mailed
your husband a bomb.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.769
A bomb?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.467
That doesn't make any sense.
What are you talking about?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.772
A bomb?

06:21.816 --> 06:24.253
[Sheba continues
talking indistinctly]

06:24.296 --> 06:26.560
I think I know who did this.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.608
My wife.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.623
TORRES: Our package thief
is Edie Samples.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.625
A doorbell camera
caught her in the act.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.453
McGEE: It appears she and
boyfriend Walt Fergus

06:50.497 --> 06:51.454
followed the delivery truck

06:51.498 --> 06:53.108
and stole all the packages.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.371
They picked the wrong
package to poach.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.372
Who was the bomb's
real target?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.547
Petty Officer First Class

06:57.591 --> 06:59.157
Todd Nicholas. 27.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.942
Graduated from SEAL
training two months ago.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.944
As squared away
as they come.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.207
What about his wife?BISHOP: Sheba Nicholas.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.731
25. No kids,
no record, no job,

07:07.775 --> 07:10.560
until she joined the reality
show Real Wives of War

07:10.604 --> 07:11.822
two seasons ago.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.215
McGEE: Actually, it
was two and a half.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.260
She was in all 41 episodes,

07:15.304 --> 07:17.088
if you count
the two-parter as one,

07:17.132 --> 07:21.615
which I personally
like to... do.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.052
Go on.Well, I-I don't know
all that much.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.707
No, it's okay, McGee. I mean,
we've already judged you, so...

07:28.143 --> 07:29.449
Oh, okay.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.581
Well, the show's about
four military wives, right?

07:31.625 --> 07:35.063
Charlotte, Tessa, Angela--
Angela's quite the instigator.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.892
Actually, Tess and Char-Char
are pretty catty, too.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.242
CharMy point is that Sheba

07:40.285 --> 07:42.113
is the wholesome,
virtuous one.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.072
She loves everyone,
especially her husband.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.160
Last week's episode...

07:45.203 --> 07:46.857
We got it. You think
she's innocent.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.904
Boss, the Sheba I know would
never do anything like this.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.256
Now that I say that out loud,
I feel slightly embarrassed.

07:54.299 --> 07:57.128
Hey, Tim...
you should be.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.826
GIBBS:
"Char-Char."

08:09.140 --> 08:11.099
Were you able to
trace that package?

08:11.142 --> 08:13.188
Dead end. It was sent
by a "G. Washington"

08:13.231 --> 08:16.278
with a return address
to the Lincoln Memorial.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.368
Your turn. Why do you
think your wife sent it?

08:21.805 --> 08:24.025
Three days ago,
Sheba threatened to kill me.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.113
Why?

08:25.156 --> 08:26.375
She thinks I'm having an affair.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.159
Are you?

08:28.203 --> 08:30.422
Do I have to tell the truth
in here, sir?

08:30.466 --> 08:32.729
Well, that depends.
You like bombs in your mail?

08:32.773 --> 08:37.168
I'm not having an affair.
But I told her I was.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.430
Okay.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.737
I want out
of my marriage.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.348
That woman is not the person
I fell in love with.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.612
That show turned her into
a total psycho.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.179
Silly question:
why not just divorce?

08:48.223 --> 08:49.616
I've tried.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.792
She won't do it;
she thinks I'll make a play

08:51.835 --> 08:53.794
for her reality money.

08:53.837 --> 08:58.363
Okay, her threat--
what did she say, exactly?

08:58.407 --> 09:03.151
She told me that she would
chop off my, um... manhood...

09:04.413 --> 09:08.243
...while I slept, and then laugh
as I bled to death.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.855
Mm. Oh, my God.

09:11.899 --> 09:15.859
I love him so much.
He's my whole world.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.427
How can he accuse me
of something like this?

09:18.470 --> 09:20.864
Well, maybe...I just don't understand.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.866
It doesn't make any sense!

09:22.910 --> 09:24.302
Sheba.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.869
You can stop now.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.958
We know your marriage
is falling apart.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.877
Todd told you that, huh?

09:33.921 --> 09:35.357
Typical.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.577
Then why'd you let me go on
blubbering like that?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.100
You ruined my mascara.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.884
I am so sorry.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.060
Why were you blubbering
like that?

09:43.104 --> 09:44.888
Look, this is me.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.370
If you don't like it,
change the channel.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.330
Three days ago,
did you threaten...

09:52.374 --> 09:54.463
Seriously, do you guys
have a mirror or something?

09:54.506 --> 09:56.639
Of course you do.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.162
SLOANE:
Fascinating.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.860
Never meet your heroes, McGee.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.079
McGEE:
I don't get it. She doesn't
act like this on the show.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.385
Key word: "act."

10:03.428 --> 10:05.605
Yeah, but she's not an actor.
Reality shows...

10:05.648 --> 10:06.954
Detach from reality.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.347
Okay, Sheba, enough.
Sit down.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.871
Can I talk to
someone else?

10:10.914 --> 10:13.090
What's that other
agent's name, McGoo?

10:13.134 --> 10:15.179
He's in there, right?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.920
Charming.McGoo?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.356
I said sit down.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.445
Fine.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.800
Anyways, that's the camera
you should be playing to.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.413
Wait, you guys are
recording this?

10:31.456 --> 10:34.459
Hey, do you think my producers
can get access to this tape?

10:34.503 --> 10:37.375
Did you or did you not
threaten your husband?

10:37.419 --> 10:39.943
Let me save you a lot of time.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.380
I don't know how to make a bomb.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.514
But you know who does?
My husband.

10:45.557 --> 10:48.256
The Navy taught him.
He knows I check the mail.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.607
Maybe he addressed the bomb
to himself to avoid suspicion.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.435
Did you ever think of that?

10:57.091 --> 10:58.222
She makes a good point.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.615
Her husband's
a trained killer,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.486
and he told Torres
he wanted out of the marriage.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.751
Just can't quit her, huh, McGoo?

11:09.843 --> 11:12.323
[phones ringing, woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.]

11:21.332 --> 11:23.073
Shoot.
Oh.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.858
I'll get that for you.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.381
Oh, my goodness.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.252
Do you mind
if I just lean on you?

11:28.296 --> 11:30.124
Sure, whatever you need.Oh, thank you.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.387
Oh. Thank you.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.476
It has been a mess today.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.828
I didn't eat. Had to park
three blocks away.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.135
It took me 15 minutes
to put on these pants.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.442
Okay.Oh, thank God.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.880
Here you go.Thank you.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.099
:
Ah.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.189
Look at us. The walking wounded.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.801
What happened to you?

11:54.844 --> 11:57.194
On-the-job injury.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.282
Sorry. What do you do?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.545
Government work.In D.C.?

12:00.589 --> 12:02.765
No way.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.593
How about you?

12:04.636 --> 12:06.551
Middle school teacher.Ah.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.685
Yeah. My students
think this is hilarious.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.643
So what happened?Oh, it involved

12:11.687 --> 12:13.602
two piña coladas
and a diving board.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.388
I was more flexible in college.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.781
Hey. We all were.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.087
Mallory?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.871
That is my cue.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.352
Let me get your bag for you. Hi.Oh, thank you.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.795
So we start with the torso.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.450
Then we add the arms.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.498
Next up, we have

12:40.542 --> 12:42.892
:
the legs.

12:46.591 --> 12:50.291
And then we have the head.

12:51.683 --> 12:55.165
You forgot the, uh, the eyes,
nose and mouth.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.819
No, no, I didn't.

12:56.863 --> 13:00.780
I'm sorry, there's no face
in hangman, Nick.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.956
Oh, wow. McGee already told you?

13:04.479 --> 13:07.221
The man is not your friend.
I'll just leave it at that.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.744
You'll leave what at what?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.877
Maybe I should just leave.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.444
I asked Agent Torres
to come down here and help me

13:13.488 --> 13:15.925
identify some of these tats;
I thought some of them

13:15.969 --> 13:17.622
might be gang-related.No, they're not.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.450
Yeah. I know that now.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.626
As for cause of death,
no surprise there.

13:21.670 --> 13:25.587
I am calling this one
"Mail-order death."

13:25.630 --> 13:27.023
GIBBS:
What is this?

13:27.067 --> 13:29.504
Found this embedded in
one of the victims' thighs.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.898
I think it might be
a timing mechanism.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.117
Melted in the heat.Right.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.337
This bomb packed
quite a punch, Gibbs.

13:36.380 --> 13:41.255
Someone wanted Petty
Officer Nicholas very dead.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.824
Here's another one. Sheba is
"soulless, vapid, shallow..."

13:44.867 --> 13:47.609
"Disgraceful,
shameful, embarrassing..."

13:47.652 --> 13:50.003
McGEE: "The most ratchet hair
I've seen on a rich person"?

13:50.046 --> 13:51.961
I guess fans
saw through her act.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.529
TV viewers can be pretty savvy.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.444
Well, how did
Delilah and I miss it?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.315
You missed what?Well, boss, we're doing

13:58.359 --> 14:00.622
a deep dive into the R-WOW
forums looking for suspects.

14:00.665 --> 14:01.884
The R

14:01.928 --> 14:04.365
Real Wives of War.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.280
Turns out
the Internet hates Sheba.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.456
I agree with the Internet.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.632
What about the husband

14:10.675 --> 14:12.112
Target.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.027
You know that all SEALs undergo
demolitions training.

14:14.070 --> 14:17.595
Yeah, and full psych evals,
McGee. A SEAL did not do this.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.033
We found only four online
threats against the husband.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.644
All posted
nine months ago

14:22.687 --> 14:23.906
by the same person.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.082
"Sheba deserves
a better man

14:26.126 --> 14:28.911
"than her warmongering
husband, who needs to

14:28.955 --> 14:30.695
die on the battlefield."

14:30.739 --> 14:32.306
Oh, I've heard
way worse than that.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.698
GIBBS:
"LLL..."

14:33.742 --> 14:34.699
"LLLeonardo"?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.788
Oh, real name is Leonard Finnik.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.095
Lives in Baltimore. You want
us to pay him a visit?

14:39.139 --> 14:41.750
Oh, come on, guys. Anybody can
say anything on the Internet.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.578
I myself have
posted major shade

14:43.621 --> 14:45.885
on Shakira
when she released She Wolf.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.495
You remember the album,
right, Gibbs?

14:47.538 --> 14:50.193
I didn't have any federal agents
asking me questions.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.673
You drive safe, Torres.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.633
Take McGee with you.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.686
Two hours here and two hours
home, and for what?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.731
We got to turn
every stone.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.777
Come on, man.
You look at this guy's file?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.431
This guy's Mr. Normal.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.303
Look, he's got a welcome mat.

15:13.347 --> 15:16.611
No mad bomber in the history of
mad bombers has a welcome mat.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.526
And you know this how?

15:18.569 --> 15:19.875
Everyone knows this.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.758
TORRES:
Leonard? Federal agents.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.545
We're coming in.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.508
See, no Unabomber vibe here.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.731
Eek. This guy does have
bad taste in music, though.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.515
Yeah, says the man
who hates Shakira.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.431
Hey, I love Shakira.
I love Shakira.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.129
Just venting.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.567
Kitchen's clear.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.787
So what'd you write her,
exactly?

16:02.831 --> 16:04.789
Bathroom's clear.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.836
Tim, that is between
me and Shakira.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.976
Bedroom is clear.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.685
Well, so much
for Mr. Normal, huh?

16:47.310 --> 16:50.922
"I know you've been watching me.
I'm here whenever you want me.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.533
We belong
together forever."

16:52.576 --> 16:54.056
TORRES:
Wow. Forever is

16:54.100 --> 16:55.318
a very long time.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.581
Do you want to tell
Delilah, or should I?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.844
Ha. No, these are from
our suspect, Leonard Finnik.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.891
He's been sending Sheba
love letters for months.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.762
And stuffed animals, too.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.504
I thought maybe this can help
with your investigation.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.767
Wha-- you kept gifts
from your stalker?

17:09.811 --> 17:11.726
Well, a fan's a fan.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.468
I'm sure you've read some of the
things they say about me online.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.773
I take what I can get.

17:16.774 --> 17:17.862
Besides, you should read
what Leonard

17:17.906 --> 17:19.255
writes about my...

17:19.299 --> 17:21.388
Give me an update.TORRES: Oh, McGee was

17:21.431 --> 17:22.519
just getting it.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.086
Boss, Sheba brought in
a box of letters

17:24.130 --> 17:25.740
from Leonard Finnik.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.090
He's got a bee in his bonnet
for Petty Officer Nicholas.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.092
Talks about how "the enemy
must be vanquished,"

17:30.136 --> 17:31.659
calls him the
"villain SEAL."

17:31.702 --> 17:34.270
And I've got another
eight boxes in my trunk.

17:34.314 --> 17:36.011
Heavy boxes.Oh, I got them.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.187
Torres, handle it.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.189
Uh, probably
a better idea, boss.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.277
You got a location?

17:41.321 --> 17:43.149
No, not yet.
Uh, Finnik has no record,

17:43.192 --> 17:45.107
no car, no job.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.022
He have a cell phone?Yes, but...

17:47.066 --> 17:48.676
Yes, but what?BISHOP: Uh, yes.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.025
Normally, we
would ping it,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.896
but that meeting
you missed this morning?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.811
No more pinging.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.466
Find some other way
to get ahold of Leonard.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.208
Sure.
I'll just use black magic.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.864
Oh, come on,
this could be so easy.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.866
I'll just ping this one time
and then never again.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.869
What about "privacy
outweighs security"?

18:07.912 --> 18:10.828
There are no atheists
in foxholes.Oh.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.092
Vance never would've
signed off on this.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.137
Well, when he comes back,
you should talk to him.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.183
If he gets back, you mean.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.967
Do you know something I don't?

18:21.100 --> 18:24.538
All I know is that
reentry is a bitch.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.457
Yeah, I just finished.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.285
KAYLA: How'd it go?Uh, it went well.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.895
You're headed
to work now, right?

18:33.938 --> 18:36.115
No, no. I'm way too sore
to go to work. Uh...

18:36.158 --> 18:37.725
Dad, you promised.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.901
Kayla, we're not gonna
go through this again, okay?

18:39.944 --> 18:41.903
Whatever. Bye.I told you, we...

18:41.946 --> 18:44.253
Hello?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.908
Just tell her
pain is progress.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.563
Hey, there. Um, Mallory, right?

18:49.606 --> 18:52.740
Good memory.
How'd your appointment go, uh...

18:52.783 --> 18:54.524
Leon. Um...

18:54.568 --> 18:59.399
Ava beat me up pretty good,
but nothing I can't handle.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.836
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
running marathons in no time.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.144
Maybe half-marathons.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.842
How are you?I'll be cheering you on
from the sidelines.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.539
Still a long road ahead for me.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.193
Hmm.AVA: Okay, Leon.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.238
Nice working with you.

19:12.281 --> 19:16.633
Um, you, too, uh, Ava.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.200
What, are you, are you leaving?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.419
No, you are.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.855
They didn't tell you?No.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.987
You graduated.
No more PT for you.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.989
Wow. Congratulations.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.774
Well, thanks.

19:26.817 --> 19:30.778
Um, I like your confidence,
but I, um,

19:30.821 --> 19:33.868
still have a little hitch
in my get along here.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.565
Some residual pain is normal.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.263
But it shouldn't stop you
getting back to your routine.

19:37.306 --> 19:40.222
You're cleared
for work, too.Huh. Uh...

19:40.266 --> 19:43.834
Yeah. Because, uh...

19:43.878 --> 19:46.576
because I-I really, I-I really
feel like I could use

19:46.620 --> 19:48.448
another-another week of PT.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.278
Well, if you need it,
you need it.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.670
Okay.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.281
All right. Same time tomorrow?

19:56.630 --> 19:58.632
All right.

20:02.113 --> 20:06.335
Every time I think I'm out,
they pull me back in.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.818
Kase?Gibbs, you're
just in time.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.689
Open the box.

20:12.733 --> 20:13.995
What's in it?

20:14.038 --> 20:16.215
A bomb.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.216
Just open it.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.914
My first bomb.
Neat, huh?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.266
[sound effect crackles,
pops, whistles]

20:24.310 --> 20:26.137
Boom.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.878
I built a replica

20:27.922 --> 20:30.229
based on the components
I found among the fragments.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.143
There's the power source

20:32.187 --> 20:34.058
and the trigger mechanism.Photo cell.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.453
Rigged to explode
when it detects light.

20:37.497 --> 20:41.065
Two caps, two fire-sets.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.850
Redundancies
to ensure detonation.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.852
This guy knew what he was doing.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.115
This guy?

20:47.158 --> 20:49.726
Well, I assume
all bombers are dudes.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.946
Right. Never assume.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.165
Yeah. And never say "dudes."

20:54.209 --> 20:55.341
What else you got?

20:55.384 --> 20:56.864
I analyzed this object

20:56.907 --> 20:58.953
Jimmy found embedded
in our victim's leg.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.042
Metal alloy plated
with 22-karat gold.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.087
It came from our
bomb, but I can't

21:03.131 --> 21:04.219
figure out its function.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.569
Ooh, and look at the back.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.397
See how it's raised?

21:08.441 --> 21:11.182
Maybe that part came
from a clasp or a pin.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.141
Call me crazy,
but this looks like a brooch.

21:13.184 --> 21:17.014
Oh, you're not exactly
a brooch guy.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.017
It's, um,
it's a piece of jewelry,

21:20.061 --> 21:22.368
like a clip,
that you wear on your lapel.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.021
Like a fancy,
older lady might.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.849
You know, it's probably
not a brooch at all.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.851
I should probably just
keep working. Toodle-oo.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.770
McGEE:
First, I had to track

21:33.814 --> 21:36.120
Leonard's credit card
to the stationery store.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.122
Right? Then I had
to go through the store's

21:38.166 --> 21:40.124
parking lot surveillance
security footage

21:40.168 --> 21:42.823
to find the car he drove--
his mom's, by the way.

21:42.866 --> 21:45.304
Then I had to sift through
red light cameras

21:45.347 --> 21:47.306
to track him
to this barber shop.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.655
It's called work, brah.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.265
It's unnecessary work.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.006
I could've just pinged him.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.964
Rules are rules,
Mr. Hangman.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.052
Look, hey, just bec...McGee.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.360
What's he carrying?

21:58.404 --> 22:00.362
Leonard.Yes?

22:00.406 --> 22:02.146
Federal agents.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.104
Drop the box.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.062
McGEE:
Wait, no.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.281
Don't drop the box.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.935
Right. Don't-don't drop the box.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.938
Excuse me, everyone,
federal agents.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.506
Please calmly and
quickly clear the area.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.159
No, not you, Leonard.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.205
You get back here.
Don't move.

22:17.248 --> 22:21.078
Bishop, bomb squad,
Lemon and Fifth.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.471
Bomb squad?

22:22.515 --> 22:24.299
Wait, for this?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.214
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Stop, stop!Don't! Get down!

22:30.436 --> 22:32.176
Huh.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.395
That's the Little Bighorn River,

22:33.439 --> 22:35.745
and that's a pronghorn deer,

22:35.789 --> 22:37.921
and an otter and, uh,

22:37.965 --> 22:40.141
that's me and, uh...

22:40.184 --> 22:41.185
Sheba and your love child.

22:41.229 --> 22:44.188
Yeah, we've been over this.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.539
Leonard.

22:46.582 --> 22:50.325
I need to talk to you
about your bedroom.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.459
This is the hollowed-out log
for fishing or, you know...

22:53.502 --> 22:54.721
Leonard. Focus.

22:54.764 --> 22:58.159
Bedroom.

22:59.769 --> 23:02.076
Oh, do you like it?
Sheba loves it.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.469
You talked to her?
Yeah.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.471
She told me in a dream
the other night.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.211
No, she didn't.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.996
Uh, were you there?

23:09.039 --> 23:11.346
Dreams are not
reality, Leonard.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.742
You are so naive.

23:15.785 --> 23:20.224
Okay. All right,
explain this to me.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.922
So this is you?

23:21.965 --> 23:23.358
LEONARD:
Right. Yeah, yeah.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.838
That's Sheba.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.013
LEONARD:
Uh-huh. Pretty hair.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.710
And that is
a dead buffalo.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.495
LEONARD: Correct.
That's correct.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.322
Who is the dead buffalo?

23:33.412 --> 23:37.981
Is that Sheba's husband,
Petty Officer Nicholas?

23:39.505 --> 23:41.463
Leonard.

23:41.507 --> 23:45.598
Did Sheba ask you to kill
her husband in that dream?

23:53.649 --> 23:55.564
Episode 33,

23:55.608 --> 23:59.394
just after the commercial
about the tortilla chips,

23:59.438 --> 24:03.311
Sheba's white shirt
isn't ironed.

24:04.704 --> 24:08.447
And she just gives me
the littlest nod, like so.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.971
She goes...

24:11.014 --> 24:12.407
Wow.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.583
Yeah.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.193
What does that mean?

24:16.237 --> 24:18.152
It means nothing.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.806
You don't think he's our guy?

24:19.849 --> 24:22.243
His cord doesn't quite
reach the outlet,

24:22.286 --> 24:24.985
but I've read his file

24:25.028 --> 24:26.769
and he has never shown
a propensity towards violence

24:26.813 --> 24:28.597
and I doubt he would start now.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.817
So, should we go rescue Torres?

24:30.860 --> 24:32.775
We got a problem.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.298
Another mail bomb
just detonated.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.517
What

24:35.561 --> 24:37.650
Alexandria. One dead.

24:37.693 --> 24:38.868
Same M.O. as the first bomb

24:38.912 --> 24:40.217
and this one came
by one-hour delivery.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.480
Leonard's been
in here for two.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.220
Yeah, which means...

24:43.264 --> 24:45.309
We've got a serial bomber
on the loose.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.886
Two bombs, three victims.
Will there be more?

24:56.930 --> 24:58.975
That's the question
paralyzing the city today

24:59.019 --> 25:01.848
as pressure mounts on NCIS,
which has taken the lead

25:01.891 --> 25:04.067
in the investigation,
even as the agency's director

25:04.111 --> 25:05.416
remains on extended medic...

25:05.460 --> 25:07.636
We don't make
news. Update.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.030
McGEE: Second bombing victim
was Patricia Everett.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.815
48 years old, divorced,
two kids in college.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.601
Package was delivered
via Global Courier's

25:15.644 --> 25:16.602
one-hour delivery service.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.473
Everett was the recipient.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.649
Who's the sender?Fake. Just like the last one.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.608
GIBBS: What's the connection
with our targets?BISHOP: Nothing yet.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.611
Uh, no mutual friends,
no social media overlap

25:25.654 --> 25:27.526
and no six degrees
of Kevin Bacon and we've looked.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.657
Look harder.

25:28.701 --> 25:33.009
What if there is no connection?

25:33.053 --> 25:36.099
What if the bomber is picking
his targets from the phone book?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.450
"Hey, Gibbs.

25:39.494 --> 25:43.759
"Need to talk...

25:43.803 --> 25:49.069
about second bomb."

25:49.112 --> 25:52.289
Oh, wait. Oh, not a texter.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.292
Ah.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.294
Stupid.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.339
What we got?
Oh.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.996
We can do this again
if you'd like.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.345
No, um, sorry.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.825
Uh, so I ran a
chemical analysis

26:05.868 --> 26:07.609
and was able to
confirm both bombs

26:07.653 --> 26:09.393
were built by
the same person.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.352
Both contained
identical isomers

26:11.395 --> 26:13.615
of nitrocellulose,
trinitrobenzene

26:13.659 --> 26:15.138
and acetone peroxide.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.010
TNB? That's
military ordinance.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.795
Oh, yes, indeed.
Oh, also,

26:19.839 --> 26:22.145
I found a second brooch,

26:22.189 --> 26:24.191
which, if you recall,
a brooch is a...Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I recall.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.236
Again, I can find no
function that this serves

26:26.280 --> 26:27.542
in the bomb.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.109
It's the bomber's
signature.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.851
Okay, yeah, well, what's
he trying to say with it?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.202
Budweiser.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.814
Budweiser?

26:38.858 --> 26:40.294
Thank you.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.338
Thank you.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.818
What happened exactly?

26:42.862 --> 26:45.255
Kasie Hines, no, no.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.083
You stay here.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.650
You're gonna find out
what happened soon enough.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.651
TORRES:
The Budweiser.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.087
The coveted trident pin

26:51.131 --> 26:53.568
awarded to all Navy SEALs
upon graduation.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.222
BISHOP: And you think
that's a melted trident?

26:55.265 --> 26:56.876
The bombs are
SEAL related.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.225
But we've been over this.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.879
Pat Everett has no connection
to the Navy.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.576
And we vetted all
20 Navy SEALs

27:01.620 --> 27:03.970
that were in Petty Officer
Nicholas's graduating class.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.101
What about the ones
who rang out?

27:05.145 --> 27:07.190
It's a bigger list. Hold on.

27:07.234 --> 27:10.324
Um...

27:11.194 --> 27:13.936
204 candidates washed out.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.155
How many made it
through demolition training?

27:15.198 --> 27:17.984
That should
narrow it down.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.160
Only 16.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.162
How many of those 16
failed their psych eval?

27:22.205 --> 27:24.120
Only one.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.948
Put him up.

27:25.992 --> 27:29.125
Hmm. David West.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.736
He washed out
about four months ago.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.521
Now lives in West Virginia where
he works security at a mall.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.218
McGEE:
Look at that.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.960
The psychologist that
administered West's psych eval

27:38.004 --> 27:39.527
was a Dr. Patrick Everett.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.747
Sound familiar?

27:41.790 --> 27:44.053
The second bomb victim
was Patricia Everett.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.489
Can't be a coincidence.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.883
Either our bomber really
hates the Everett family...

27:47.927 --> 27:49.102
Don't know if they're related.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.233
...or he killed the
wrong Pat Everett.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.582
Where is West right now?

27:51.626 --> 27:54.281
Pinging his cell phone.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.500
Boss, let me just say
that I think

27:56.544 --> 27:59.416
this new nonpinging
policy sucks.

27:59.460 --> 28:03.290
McGee, we got the mall.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.815
Bishop, Torres,
take his house.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.687
Let's go.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.216
Hi.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.521
How are you, Kayla?

28:17.565 --> 28:20.263
Oh. I-I called Gibbs.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.265
And he called me.
How's your dad?

28:22.309 --> 28:23.614
Not great.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.268
It's like he's lost
his mojo or something.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.314
Well, we'll have
to help him get it back.
Yeah.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.445
Jack?

28:28.489 --> 28:30.926
Hey, Leon. How you doing?Hey. Okay.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.928
Good to see you.
You, too.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.277
You, too. Oh.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.497
Handy.
Oh, shoot.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.107
Home improvement project.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.718
I got a sticky window
in the guest room.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.502
Something else
in this house won't budge.

28:41.545 --> 28:45.201
And to what do we
owe this visit?

28:45.245 --> 28:47.421
Was just in the area,
wanted to see how you're doing.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.118
I'm better every day.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.338
I'm looking forward to
getting back into the office.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.600
Mm-hmm.

28:52.643 --> 28:55.995
You weren't "in the
area," were you?

28:56.038 --> 28:57.779
And you're not "better
every day," are you?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.216
And I have you
to thank for this?

29:00.260 --> 29:02.305
Who wants coffee? I do.

29:02.349 --> 29:05.744
Thank you.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.137
So, tell me everything.
What's happening?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.617
Yeah, why don't we skip
all the pleasantries

29:09.660 --> 29:11.358
and you can tell me why
you're really here?

29:11.401 --> 29:14.970
Okay. Want to just rip
that Band

29:15.014 --> 29:16.493
Fine with me.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.237
You were tricked
by a terrorist, Leon.

29:21.281 --> 29:25.198
You made a bad decision that
nearly cost thousands of lives

29:25.241 --> 29:27.156
and now you are coping
with that mistake

29:27.200 --> 29:29.680
by practicing avoidance
and social withdrawal.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.204
How about that?

29:31.247 --> 29:34.163
I am rehabbing my hip.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.643
That's all.

29:35.686 --> 29:40.387
That's blame shifting.
Normal defense mechanism

29:40.430 --> 29:42.432
for someone in your
condition, by the way.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.651
Jack, I'm fine.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.958
No, you're afraid.

29:46.001 --> 29:48.090
You don't trust
your instincts anymore.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.962
Not good for someone

29:50.005 --> 29:52.094
who makes life or death
decisions every day

29:52.138 --> 29:54.575
and that fear
can be paralyzing, Leon.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.882
I always thought
that psychologists

29:56.925 --> 29:59.014
would examine their patients

29:59.058 --> 30:00.494
before providing
diagnosis.

30:00.537 --> 30:01.843
Ah, no, we don't
have time for that,

30:01.887 --> 30:03.453
so I just thought
I'd skip to the end.

30:03.497 --> 30:06.195
And I'm sure you have
just the right prescription.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.284
As a matter of fact, I do.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.983
In my professional opinion...

30:11.026 --> 30:13.072
you need to get your ass
back in the saddle.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.639
Thanks for stopping by, Jack.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.424
Leon, listen.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.992
Hey. You want a real project

30:20.035 --> 30:21.515
to do around the house?

30:21.558 --> 30:24.039
The agency that you lead

30:24.083 --> 30:25.998
is trying to stop
a serial bomber.

30:26.041 --> 30:29.305
Everything you need to know
about the suspect.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.277
David West?

30:45.582 --> 30:47.454
TORRES:
Wait. NCIS!

30:47.497 --> 30:49.630
Mr. West, we just have
a few questions!

30:49.673 --> 30:52.720
Easy, easy, easy.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.287
Gun!

31:02.512 --> 31:04.863
Okay. I don't think he
wants to talk to us.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.908
He can talk to my SIG.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.475
Ready? One...
Yeah.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.783
...two...
Nick.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.395
Go. Go!

31:20.400 --> 31:21.836
Go!

31:35.806 --> 31:37.547
Okay. SWAT team's
on the way.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.114
Gibbs and McGee are
coming back from the mall.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.203
They should be here
any minute. All right?All right.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.335
Now, let me take
a look at this.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.380
Ow, ow.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.035
Ooh...

31:47.079 --> 31:48.080
How bad is it?

31:48.123 --> 31:51.213
Uh, it's not great,
Nick. Ooh.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.998
Oh, Bishop!Shrapnel's in there
pretty deep.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.129
Oh, that's peachy.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.304
Okay.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.653
Cut it out.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.003
You're not serious.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.308
Yes, I'm serious.
Cut it out.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.614
No, Nick.
This guy tried
to kill me, okay?

32:00.657 --> 32:02.094
I'm about to try to kill him,

32:02.137 --> 32:03.878
but I can't do it with
that thing in my back,

32:03.922 --> 32:05.401
so just-just dig it out.
Okay.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.881
Fine. You're an idiot.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.187
Wait, what's that for?

32:08.230 --> 32:10.798
I'm sterilizing
my tool. Here.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.234
Bite onto this.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.062
Oh. Oh, we're doing this.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.107
Can you make up
your mind already?

32:15.150 --> 32:16.369
Well, I'm just saying

32:16.412 --> 32:17.805
that maybe-maybe
that guy is gone.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.763
I-I didn't hear him shoot
for, like, a little bit.

32:19.807 --> 32:22.244
Oh, the guy is gone.
Are you...

32:22.288 --> 32:24.203
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

32:24.246 --> 32:25.465
He's still there.

32:25.508 --> 32:26.596
That was my favorite hat.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.381
Can... are we gonna
do this or what?

32:28.424 --> 32:30.992
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready, I'm ready.
Okay.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.776
One, two...
McGEE:
Hey, Torres.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.169
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

32:34.213 --> 32:36.389
The cavalry's here.What?

32:40.523 --> 32:42.351
What is he doing?Uh, no idea.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.661
BISHOP:
Where did he go?

32:47.704 --> 32:49.576
Where's Gibbs?

32:55.321 --> 32:57.105
Okay, I got him, boss.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.107
Bishop and Torres?

32:59.151 --> 33:00.979
Oh, they're okay.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.332
Bishop!

33:06.375 --> 33:07.594
Torres!

33:07.637 --> 33:09.335
Cease fire, we're
on the way out!

33:24.350 --> 33:25.351
Nice hat.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.490
In times of war and uncertainty,

33:34.534 --> 33:36.144
there is a special breed of

33:36.188 --> 33:38.233
warrior ready to answer
our nation's call.

33:38.277 --> 33:41.193
A common man with an
uncommon desire to succeed...

33:41.236 --> 33:43.064
Director Vance.Special Agent Gibbs.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.326
Good to see you.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.241
Good to be here.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.416
...special breed of warrior

33:47.460 --> 33:49.070
ready to answer
our nation's call.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.376
The Navy SEAL creed.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.291
He's been reciting it
for the last hour.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.510
He built his whole life
around becoming a SEAL.

33:54.554 --> 33:57.818
When he washed out,
he had nothing to fall back on.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.080
You read his file.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.255
Three times.

34:00.299 --> 34:01.822
DAVID:
My word is my bond.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.824
I've had some time on my hands.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.826
DAVID: ...and be led.
In the absence of orders,

34:05.869 --> 34:07.219
I will take charge,

34:07.262 --> 34:09.264
lead my teammates
and accomplish the mission.

34:09.308 --> 34:12.050
I lead by example
in all situations.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.400
I will never quit.
I persevere and thrive

34:14.443 --> 34:16.097
on adversity.
My nation

34:16.141 --> 34:18.056
expects me to...

34:18.099 --> 34:19.318
You recognize that?

34:19.361 --> 34:21.363
Maybe you don't, since
you never earned one,

34:21.407 --> 34:23.757
but it's a Budweiser,
trident pin.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.063
It's a real one,

34:25.106 --> 34:26.629
unlike the knockoffs
you purchased

34:26.673 --> 34:29.458
at the Navy surplus store
and packed into your mail bombs.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.855
Sorry. Budweisers
are for SEALs only.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.205
And you washed out.

34:37.249 --> 34:41.818
Dr. Everett made a mistake,

34:41.862 --> 34:43.168
sir.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.821
So you sent him a bomb?

34:44.865 --> 34:46.954
Along with one to
Petty Officer Nicholas,

34:46.997 --> 34:48.521
who red-flagged you
for a psych exam?

34:48.564 --> 34:50.827
They got what
they deserved, ma'am.

34:50.871 --> 34:53.308
No, they didn't.

34:53.352 --> 34:57.182
Nicholas is still alive, and
you killed the wrong Everett.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.444
Mission failed.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.665
You win some, you lose some.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.414
The hell is he
so smug about?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.421
Why don't you go find out?

35:19.465 --> 35:22.250
You read his file...

35:22.294 --> 35:23.295
three times.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.474
Director Vance, welcome ba--

35:30.432 --> 35:33.609
Where's he going?

35:39.354 --> 35:40.834
Are you having a good time?

35:42.227 --> 35:43.445
Sir?

35:47.754 --> 35:50.496
You want to tell me
what's so funny?

35:50.539 --> 35:53.325
We train for war
and fight to win.

35:53.368 --> 35:56.154
I stand ready to bring the
full spectrum of combat power

35:56.197 --> 35:57.459
to bear in order to achieve

35:57.503 --> 35:59.766
my mission and the goals
established by my country.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.463
You've been looking
at your watch a lot.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.378
Are you late for
something, David?

36:03.422 --> 36:04.814
The execution of my abilities
will be swift

36:04.858 --> 36:05.815
and violent when required...

36:05.859 --> 36:07.339
Or am I?

36:07.382 --> 36:08.992
...the very principles
that I serve to defend.

36:09.036 --> 36:12.518
Brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition...

36:12.561 --> 36:14.346
You sent a third bomb,
didn't you?

36:20.352 --> 36:22.005
Who is the third target?

36:22.049 --> 36:25.313
Who is it?

36:25.357 --> 36:26.749
Who else wronged you?

36:26.793 --> 36:28.577
Could it have been another
SEAL classmate?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.013
20 of them graduated.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.537
Yeah, go.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.896
That's a nice tan line.

36:44.376 --> 36:47.292
Where's the ring?

36:47.335 --> 36:49.294
David, you just got married.
Where's your wedding band?

36:56.388 --> 36:58.433
WOMAN:
Thanks.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.608
It's the wife.

36:59.652 --> 37:03.656
Gwen Eisley.
Married five months ago.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.614
She walked out on you, huh?

37:06.528 --> 37:08.748
Where's she staying?

37:08.791 --> 37:11.229
She at her mother's house
in Alexandria?

37:12.882 --> 37:15.711
Or maybe she's staying at her
brother's in Philly?

37:15.755 --> 37:17.757
Or she's staying at
her sister's in Middleburg?

37:20.455 --> 37:22.631
Sister's in Middleburg.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.552
Don't play poker
in prison, David.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.208
You have a tell.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.579
Leave a message.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.543
What?

38:06.153 --> 38:08.503
What?

38:13.116 --> 38:14.901
So the wife finally
answered her cell?

38:14.944 --> 38:16.424
Fifth time's a charm.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.860
How'd she react to the news

38:17.904 --> 38:19.427
her hubby mailed her a bomb?

38:19.471 --> 38:22.561
She asked if she could
"return to sender."

38:22.604 --> 38:25.215
Ah, McGee, look.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.782
ANNOUNCER: ...and coming up
tonight on Real Wives of War,

38:26.826 --> 38:29.524
Sheba radiates in red.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.572
Oh, whoa.
Trouble in paradise?

38:33.615 --> 38:37.358
You know what? I think I'm done
with The Real Wives of War.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.664
Good for you. Yeah.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.492
You can do better things
with your life.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.145
Totally agree.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.017
There's this new show
about cops in Miami Beach...

38:45.192 --> 38:46.324
McGee.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.586
Not where you were
going with that?

38:47.629 --> 38:49.588
Okay.TORRES: He's back, baby.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.764
Hey.
Can't keep me down.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.548
How was surgery?

38:53.592 --> 38:55.245
Oh, it was a breeze.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.812
Shrapnel's all out.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.640
Told you it was
just a flesh would.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.163
Ah. So I could've
cut it out.

39:00.207 --> 39:01.774
Oh, no, that was
a real bad idea.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.253
Yeah, that's what I said.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.516
30 seconds.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.387
You'll be happy, I promise.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.476
Doubt it.One word: ping.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.566
You took away
his superpower.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.612
Because you didn't let me
finish my presentation.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.265
Yes, the
Supreme Court

39:15.309 --> 39:17.398
banned warrantless
cell location tracking...

39:17.442 --> 39:18.878
AKA no ping.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.836
...which is why we have arranged
for three on-call judges

39:20.880 --> 39:24.362
to provide near-instantaneous
warrants should the need arise.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.711
Hm.
Wait, what does
that mean?

39:25.754 --> 39:29.410
Means we are back
in business, baby.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.586
You're welcome.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.588
She's very sweet.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.155
Yeah.
Very.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.070
Yeah, when she's
nice like that, yeah.

39:39.681 --> 39:43.076
Okay, Cameron,
I'll see you Thursday.

39:44.425 --> 39:45.600
Hey, Leon,
you can change in back.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.428
Oh, uh, actually, Ava, I'm not

39:47.472 --> 39:49.387
taking therapy today,

39:49.430 --> 39:52.781
or ever, I'm, uh,
I'm canceling my appointments.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.653
Cancel the appointments
you demanded?

39:54.696 --> 39:56.263
Requested.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.960
But you were right,
my range of motion's good,

39:58.004 --> 40:00.180
and I can continue
the exercises at home.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.182
Okay, I'll cancel them.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.662
You know, you could've
just called.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.577
I was in the neighborhood.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.841
Uh-huh. I don't think
she's here yet.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.320
Who?

40:14.934 --> 40:17.066
Well, well, well.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.459
Leon.

40:18.503 --> 40:19.721
But no, uh, no more cast.

40:19.765 --> 40:23.333
Nope, just the crutches now.
What about you?

40:23.377 --> 40:24.639
I barely notice a limp.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.641
I graduated. No more PT.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.904
Oh, congratulations.Thank you.

40:30.558 --> 40:34.170
Well, good luck
with your life, I guess.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.001
Hey, um...

40:41.047 --> 40:43.963
How would you...

40:44.006 --> 40:46.879
How would you like to, um,
see each other,

40:46.922 --> 40:49.577
somewhere that's not here?

40:49.621 --> 40:52.362
I'd like that.
Great.

40:52.406 --> 40:54.582
Waterskiing, mountain climbing,
what do you think?

40:56.497 --> 40:59.021
Or we could just do
dinner tonight.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.502
Dinner sounds good.
Give me your phone.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.199
My phone

41:03.243 --> 41:04.766
So I can put my number in it.Oh, geez.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.769
I'm a little...
little rusty here.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.686
So any, um, any requests
for dinner?

41:11.730 --> 41:13.471
How about someplace
without stairs?

41:13.514 --> 41:15.603
Duly noted.
Ground-floor restaurant.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.605
All right.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.521
I'll-I'll call you.Okay.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.610
Bye.
Bye.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.668
Nice work.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.714
Thank you.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.542
What's your
assessment?

41:41.586 --> 41:44.066
I don't know yet, but I will.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.509
Hm.

41:51.552 --> 41:53.293
Well done.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.643
How long are we surveilling him?

41:55.687 --> 41:57.297
As long as it takes.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.868
Enjoy your dinner.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.785
Hey.

42:06.828 --> 42:08.917
You forgetting something?

42:13.226 --> 42:15.794
You don't want to make
that mistake tonight.

42:15.837 --> 42:19.232
You worry about you.
I'll worry about me.
