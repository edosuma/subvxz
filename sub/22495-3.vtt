09:14.658 --> 09:15.790
[ Moans ]

09:15.825 --> 09:16.357
Look out!

09:16.426 --> 09:16.891
Zoinks!

09:16.927 --> 09:17.459
Ruh-roh!

09:17.494 --> 09:23.065
That is Phillip W. Anderson, the president
and C.E.O. of this -- like, run!

09:24.134 --> 09:25.467
You wear too much purple.

09:25.536 --> 09:27.002
I know! It matches my eyes.

09:27.038 --> 09:30.072
The only humans with naturally
purple eyes are albinos.

09:30.108 --> 09:31.374
Fine! They're contacts.

09:31.409 --> 09:31.741
God!

09:31.809 --> 09:33.643
You think you know <i>everything, huh?</i>

09:33.678 --> 09:34.878
<i>You think you're</i> cool.

09:34.913 --> 09:38.615
You know, you're not the only
one with a bad-ass tattoo.

09:38.651 --> 09:41.552
I think a tumbleweed just
blew through my vagina.

09:41.587 --> 09:42.886
I know! It sucks!

09:42.922 --> 09:43.721
Fred sucks!

09:43.756 --> 09:46.357
I have the <i>worst
</i> boyfriend in the world!

09:46.392 --> 09:48.926
Maybe you could try
handcuffing him to your bed.

09:48.961 --> 09:51.094
Oh, I guess that could spice things up.

09:51.163 --> 09:51.628
Yes!

09:51.696 --> 09:55.999
And then [ bleep ] him with a
stainless-steel revenge [bleep]!

09:56.034 --> 09:58.535
[ Both grunting ]

09:58.570 --> 09:59.369
Oh!

09:59.438 --> 10:02.205
So <i>that's</i> how these girls play.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.206
[ Zip! ]

10:03.242 --> 10:03.907
Ohh.

10:03.942 --> 10:07.177
This whole park smells like sex
all of a sudden, and I get

10:07.212 --> 10:09.479
stuck with a four-legged
tang repellant.

10:09.515 --> 10:10.580
Rang re-rellent?

10:10.649 --> 10:12.582
Ray-re rit's rhe roul ratch.

10:12.651 --> 10:16.119
Did you just diss the soul patch?

10:16.154 --> 10:17.554
Rit's rhe rhost!

10:17.589 --> 10:18.755
Like, zoinks!

10:18.824 --> 10:20.123
[ Laughs ]

10:20.159 --> 10:22.126
[ Grunts ]

10:22.161 --> 10:22.860
Look!

10:22.895 --> 10:25.763
It was the amusement
park owner after all!

10:25.798 --> 10:26.731
Imbecile.

10:26.766 --> 10:30.000
We actually solved the
mystery <i>without</i> Velma.

10:30.036 --> 10:34.105
And without a tacked-on car chase
and explosion, unlike

10:34.140 --> 10:35.273
"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."

10:35.308 --> 10:36.140
Ohh!

10:36.176 --> 10:38.676
Thanks for the critique, guys.

10:38.745 --> 10:41.946
All: Stieg Larsson, author of "The
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"?!

10:42.015 --> 10:45.049
Maybe I would have done a second
draft if I hadn't died of

10:45.118 --> 10:46.317
a [bleep] heart attack!

10:46.810 --> 10:48.010
Like, hey, old dude.

10:48.045 --> 10:49.478
Did you lose a contact lens?

10:49.513 --> 10:51.513
I just took a hammer to the skull.

10:51.548 --> 10:53.415
I think my [bleep] retina flew off.

10:53.484 --> 10:55.214
[ All laugh ]

10:55.334 --> 10:58.220
Rooby-Rooby-Roo!
