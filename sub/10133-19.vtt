We're not going "ouce"-skating.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.593
Make up your minds.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.642
[thunder rumbling]

07:55.683 --> 07:59.854
- Party time.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.854
- You guys got the ice cream?

07:59.896 --> 08:02.149
Let's watch

07:59.896 --> 08:02.149
the "Top 10 Video Countdown."

08:02.190 --> 08:05.277
Alright. I love being

08:02.190 --> 08:05.277
grounded here.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.946
I want my ouce-cream.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.781
You want your<i> ice</i> cream.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.618
That's what I said.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.618
Don't you listen?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.998
Okay, on your mark,

08:13.660 --> 08:17.998
get set,<i> pig out!</i>

08:18.039 --> 08:20.083
- Yeah.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.083
- Alright.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.669
Girls, lunch time.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.255
No thanks.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.255
We skipped right to dessert.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.175
No, I mean lunch

08:25.297 --> 08:28.175
for us kids, remember?

08:28.216 --> 08:31.011
The people

08:28.216 --> 08:31.011
you're responsible for.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.014
The catch.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.059
Come on. I cleaned my room

08:35.474 --> 08:38.059
and everything.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.937
Okay, we'll make lunch, but you

08:38.101 --> 08:40.937
kids have to set the table.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.734
I'm gonna get out of here

08:43.648 --> 08:46.734
before they put me to work.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.865
Don't touch my ice cream.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.451
Alright, peanut butter

08:51.906 --> 08:54.451
and jelly on wheat.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.119
Ham and cheese on rye.

08:56.161 --> 09:00.081
And egg salad on white,

08:56.161 --> 09:00.081
no crust.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.126
Now, if you guys will excuse us,

09:00.123 --> 09:03.126
we might still catch

09:03.168 --> 09:05.337
some of the top ten videos.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.048
Hurry, you're missing

09:05.379 --> 09:08.048
number five.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.801
- We're coming.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.801
- Let's go.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.679
Hey, h-h-h-hold it.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.306
This is grape jelly.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.725
You guys know

09:16.348 --> 09:18.725
I like strawberry jelly.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.061
How could that have

09:18.766 --> 09:21.061
slipped my mind?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.438
One peanut butter and

09:21.102 --> 09:23.438
strawberry jelly coming up.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.982
- Bye.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.982
- Oh, Steph, before you go.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.818
- Uh, can I have some juice?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.818
- Juice, of course.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.945
Where was my head?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.491
- Glass.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.491
- That sounds like a great idea.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.701
- Why don't you make that two?

09:34.533 --> 09:36.701
- Okay.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.498
- Anybody else want juice?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.498
- No.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.958
Make mine milk.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.793
<i>Okay!</i>

09:51.550 --> 09:54.094
Alright. Peanut butter

09:51.550 --> 09:54.094
and strawberry jelly.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.720
Alright, PBSJ.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.476
Uh, Steph,

09:59.057 --> 10:01.476
I wanted orange juice.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.478
[grunting]

10:05.313 --> 10:07.190
I'll take apple.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.652
Apple for the big guy.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.155
I will see you

10:11.694 --> 10:14.155
in the living room.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.992
Hey, h-h-h-hold it.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.121
Still got some grape

10:18.034 --> 10:21.121
on one of these corners.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.747
Then don't eat that corner.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.707
Yes, but once the sandwich

10:22.789 --> 10:24.707
is closed it's hard to tell

10:24.749 --> 10:27.085
which is

10:24.749 --> 10:27.085
the grape-infested corner.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.722
There, now you're safe.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.684
Milli Vanilli is next.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.684
Rock n' roll.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.065
I'm coming.

10:49.107 --> 10:52.110
Ah, girls, before we drink,

10:49.107 --> 10:52.110
we need ice.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.362
Ice? Ice it is.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.199
Make mine cubes,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.199
not crushed.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.535
Make mine crushed,

10:58.241 --> 11:00.535
not cubed.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.039
Would anyone like them

11:02.537 --> 11:05.039
carved as little animals?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
Hey, this is

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
chunky peanut butter.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.711
Yeah, so?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.964
Well, I'm just not in

11:10.753 --> 11:12.964
a chunky kinda mood.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.591
Well, I'm not making you

11:13.006 --> 11:14.591
another sandwich.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.801
I'm not asking you to.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.513
What I am asking is if

11:16.843 --> 11:19.513
you can take these itsy-bitsy

11:19.554 --> 11:22.681
ugly little chunks of peanuts

11:19.554 --> 11:22.681
out of my sandwich.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.268
That's it. Lunch is over.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.479
Could you make this

11:25.310 --> 11:27.479
half crushed, half cubed?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.397
I've had it.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.397
Go to your rooms.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.483
- Right now. March.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.483
- Great game, Danny.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.734
Now, we're being punished.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.028
And no talking.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.655
- Come on.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.655
- Go to your rooms, guys.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.697
- Go, boys.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.697
- Go.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.578
Talk about your selfish,

11:40.158 --> 11:43.578
spoiled brats.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.746
All I have to say is..

11:45.788 --> 11:47.541
...how rude.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.215
Joey, we need to talk.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.924
You guys snuck down here, man.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.303
The girls grounded us. We're

11:56.966 --> 12:00.303
all gonna get in big trouble.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.430
It's a game, you idiot.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.892
How did my plan backfire?

12:05.933 --> 12:07.352
We took them totally

12:05.933 --> 12:07.352
for granted

12:07.394 --> 12:08.645
just like they did to us

12:08.687 --> 12:10.188
and they never

12:08.687 --> 12:10.188
even made the connection.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.065
Well, if we don't put

12:10.230 --> 12:12.065
a stop to this right now

12:12.106 --> 12:13.858
we're gonna be

12:12.106 --> 12:13.858
waiting on them, hand and foot

12:13.900 --> 12:16.361
for the rest of our lives.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.072
For the rest of our lives?

12:19.113 --> 12:22.325
Oh, man,

12:19.113 --> 12:22.325
I can see it now.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.118
We're still livin'

12:22.367 --> 12:24.118
in the house.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.329
The girls are still

12:24.160 --> 12:26.329
livin' in the house.

12:26.371 --> 12:30.166
That dog Comet is still

12:26.371 --> 12:30.166
living in the house.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.293
This is not a pretty picture.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.136
Stay, Comet.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.639
Play dead.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.933
You are just playing,

12:44.681 --> 12:46.933
aren't you?

12:48.767 --> 12:51.812
Alright, come on, Dusty..

12:51.854 --> 12:54.524
...let's see if you still

12:51.854 --> 12:54.524
got any suck left in you.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.736
[shouting]

12:57.776 --> 12:59.487
Alright, boy.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.031
[mimicking Popeye's laughter]

13:02.823 --> 13:04.534
Well, blow me down.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.494
Where's me Olive Oyl?

13:08.871 --> 13:11.416
Oh, you dirt-obsessed old fool,

13:08.871 --> 13:11.416
you sucked up my chip.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.920
I knew you were

13:13.752 --> 13:15.920
gonna drop it.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.548
Do I look like

13:15.962 --> 13:18.548
I've dropped any chips?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.677
They're all in there.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.677
Millions of them.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.053
Hey!

13:26.431 --> 13:29.517
Hey, what are you guys

13:26.431 --> 13:29.517
muttering about?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.728
Every time I come around,

13:29.559 --> 13:31.728
you're muttering.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.731
You're muttering to him, he's

13:31.770 --> 13:34.731
muttering.. You guys, go home.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.483
Boy, it's a beautiful...day.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.653
I remember when I ate

13:36.524 --> 13:39.653
a burrito in 1994..

13:39.694 --> 13:42.155
We're muttering?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.906
You're muttering.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.910
You think you're such

13:43.948 --> 13:47.910
a hot young stud..

13:47.952 --> 13:50.538
...you in your jungle jammies.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.043
Well, at least

13:52.457 --> 13:56.043
I still have my hair.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.591
Oh!

14:01.633 --> 14:02.967
Oh!

14:05.928 --> 14:08.807
Now I have your hair.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.351
[mimicking Popeye's laughter]

14:11.392 --> 14:13.269
Hold it. That's my date.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.269
Put my hair, fast.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.438
- Okay, hold on. Okay.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.438
- Go. Go.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.234
How's it look?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.236
Oh, very life-like.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.367
(Danny)

14:24.698 --> 14:27.367
'Help me with the food, Joey.'

14:29.327 --> 14:32.372
Oh, Jesse. My main squeeze.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.667
I wouldn't squeeze me too hard.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
I just ate.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.797
Thanks for the warning.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.095
Hey, Becky, look out for that

14:45.218 --> 14:48.095
hippopotamus behind you.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.188
Oh, sorry, you know, you really

14:53.893 --> 14:57.188
ought to put some reflectors

14:57.230 --> 14:58.523
on that thing.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.737
[kissing]

15:03.778 --> 15:05.112
Have..

15:07.990 --> 15:10.827
- A nice bowl of Cream of Wheat?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.827
- No.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.371
It has nothing to do

15:10.869 --> 15:13.371
with breakfast.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.206
Have..

15:15.248 --> 15:16.916
Mercy!

15:16.957 --> 15:19.001
You old poop.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.087
No, no, no.

15:21.128 --> 15:24.382
It's, uh, it's "Have pity."

15:27.635 --> 15:29.387
C'mon, babe, let's go down

15:27.635 --> 15:29.387
to the Smash Club

15:29.429 --> 15:32.348
and you can watch me

15:29.429 --> 15:32.348
do my thing.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.143
I'm so proud of you.

15:36.185 --> 15:40.857
My honey is the world's oldest

15:36.185 --> 15:40.857
Elvis impersonator.

15:44.444 --> 15:49.490
[mimicking Elvis Presley]

15:44.444 --> 15:49.490
Thank you very much,

15:44.444 --> 15:49.490
pretty mama.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.200
Watch me shake.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.577
[laughing]

15:56.205 --> 15:58.917
[mimicking Popeye's laughter]

15:58.958 --> 16:01.878
Joey, did you leave me

15:58.958 --> 16:01.878
some donuts?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.005
Well, if I did,

16:01.920 --> 16:05.005
it was purely by accident.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.595
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.595
Hey, don't look at my woman.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.515
Where am I supposed to look?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.812
Your woman is everywhere.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.317
Come on. Let's take

16:21.731 --> 16:24.317
the girls their breakfast.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.655
Okay, but try not to eat it all

16:24.358 --> 16:28.655
on the way up, Joey.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.908
- You fat guy.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.908
- Stop muttering.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.368
Stop muttering.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
Well, guess

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
I'll just have a seat.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.417
Hmm, better make that two.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.172
Hey, hey, hey,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.172
hey, hey, hey.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.632
Drop that toast.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.010
Ah, get off my case.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.010
I found it in my robe.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.388
- You're a slob, Joey.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.388
- You're a tall slob.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.434
Okay, rise and shine.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.687
Come on, get up, D.J.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.650
Breakfast before noon?

17:06.484 --> 17:08.402
How rude.

17:09.988 --> 17:13.533
I'm so disgusted

17:09.988 --> 17:13.533
with hearing "how rude."

17:13.574 --> 17:15.702
Dad, I can't take it anymore.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.120
I need my own room.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.414
This town is full of rooms.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.835
Go rent one,

17:20.456 --> 17:23.835
the both of you.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.085
Why would I leave?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.671
Uncle Jesse does my cooking

17:26.713 --> 17:29.966
Joey does my laundry,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.966
and dad, you do my cleaning.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.886
I love my life.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.972
Your perkiness

17:32.927 --> 17:35.972
is no longer cute.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.265
Danny, I think

17:36.014 --> 17:38.265
it's time for the, uh

17:38.307 --> 17:41.728
"One day you'll appreciate

17:38.307 --> 17:41.728
your sister" lecture.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.313
Girls, one day you'll

17:41.769 --> 17:44.313
appreciate your sister.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.149
- Good lecture.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.149
- Thank you.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.776
Now, hug.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.780
(all)

17:51.320 --> 17:52.780
Aww!

17:52.822 --> 17:55.491
(all)

17:52.822 --> 17:55.491
Now move out.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.498
Michelle! Michelle, hurry up

17:59.328 --> 18:02.498
and get in here and get your

18:02.540 --> 18:05.376
breakfast before it becomes

18:02.540 --> 18:05.376
another chin for Joey.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.255
Hi, people.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.633
Ah, Michelle, just in

18:09.296 --> 18:12.633
time for breakfast.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.928
Oh, I'm not in

18:12.675 --> 18:14.928
the mood for breakfast.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.388
Do you have any "ouce" cream?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.640
(all)

18:17.430 --> 18:19.640
It's<i> ice</i> cream.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.184
And I ate the last

18:19.682 --> 18:22.184
gallon this morning.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.978
Oh, nuts.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.066
- Hi, Tanners.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.066
- Kimmy Gibbler! Oh, my God.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.152
- Whoa, baby.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.905
Eat your hearts out, boys.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.241
Too bad you weren't nicer

18:33.947 --> 18:37.241
to me when I was a kid.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.035
[hyperventilating]

18:39.077 --> 18:41.871
Come on, girls.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.871
We gotta get to the mall.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.290
<i>Adios,</i> Tanners.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.209
I'll get dad's credit cards.

18:47.251 --> 18:51.714
I'll make a list of chores for

18:47.251 --> 18:51.714
the guys to do while we're gone.

18:51.756 --> 18:55.051
And don't forget,

18:51.756 --> 18:55.051
we'll need a ride.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.554
Whoever can make it downstairs

18:55.093 --> 18:58.554
first will drive you.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.140
You got it, dude.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.270
She was so smart

19:02.600 --> 19:06.270
when she was three.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.064
What happened?

19:09.732 --> 19:13.820
Well, did you hear

19:09.732 --> 19:13.820
one thank you today?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.655
- No.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.784
How could you let your kids

19:15.696 --> 19:19.784
get so out of control?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.327
Well, you can't blame me.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.038
I'm just the old fat guy

19:21.368 --> 19:24.038
who lives in the basement.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.583
Our lives are pathetic.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.336
No, your hair is pathetic.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.088
- Get that.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.088
- Oh, no.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.756
- Don't take my hair.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.756
- Hey, Joey, catch the rug.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.175
- Come on, now, boys.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.175
- I'm in the clear, over here.

19:36.216 --> 19:41.388
- No, Joey. Come on, Joey.

19:36.216 --> 19:41.388
- Yeah, I got it. One more time.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.349
- Joey, throw it, my boy.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.349
- It's not funny.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.352
- That's two points.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.352
- Give me my hair!

19:46.393 --> 19:48.688
- Give me my hair!

19:46.393 --> 19:48.688
- Get away from me. My arm.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.441
- Oh, my bursitis. My hip.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.441
- Give me my hair! Give me!

19:52.483 --> 19:55.069
I hear you,

19:52.483 --> 19:55.069
for crying out loud.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.283
And we all lived

19:58.614 --> 20:01.283
miserably ever after.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.412
- That was so depressing.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.412
- Yeah.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.874
Can you imagine the girls

20:05.454 --> 20:07.874
still livin' here?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.459
No, not that. My hair.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.254
Well, it doesn't have

20:12.003 --> 20:14.254
to happen that way.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.382
We can all learn something

20:14.296 --> 20:16.382
from that little story.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.468
Yeah, I'm gonna start being

20:16.423 --> 20:19.468
really nice to Kimmy Gibbler.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.850
Uncle Jesse, daddy, I thought

20:21.846 --> 20:25.850
we sent you two to your rooms.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.393
They snuck down

20:25.892 --> 20:27.393
without permission.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.978
Kiss-up!

20:29.020 --> 20:32.106
I think it's time we had

20:29.020 --> 20:32.106
a little talk with you boys.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.232
Great, first we're

20:32.148 --> 20:33.232
getting punished

20:33.273 --> 20:35.068
and now we're getting

20:33.273 --> 20:35.068
a lecture.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.362
You deserve a lecture

20:35.109 --> 20:38.362
after the way you behaved today.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.866
We try and make you a nice

20:38.404 --> 20:41.866
lunch, and what do we get?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.701
Zippo. Not a thank you.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.205
Not a "Thanks."

20:43.743 --> 20:47.205
Not a "Hey pal, good going."

20:47.246 --> 20:48.706
Not a "Way to go, chum."

20:48.748 --> 20:50.875
Not a<i> "Muchas gracias, amigo."</i>

20:50.917 --> 20:53.586
- Not a--

20:50.917 --> 20:53.586
- Steph, they get it.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.591
Well, girls,

20:56.505 --> 20:58.591
let me ask you somethin'.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.887
How does it feel not

21:00.384 --> 21:02.887
to get a thank you?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.471
Crummy.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.100
Well, just imagine how much

21:04.513 --> 21:07.100
crummier you would've felt

21:07.141 --> 21:09.268
if you had to wash

21:07.141 --> 21:09.268
our sweaters.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.644
Rush out for our film.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.688
Shared your caviar picnic.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.983
Dropped everything

21:12.730 --> 21:15.983
to take us to the movies.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.610
Excuse us.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.072
Did you happen to say

21:19.486 --> 21:21.072
a thank you

21:21.114 --> 21:23.741
for any of the things

21:21.114 --> 21:23.741
they did for us today?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.618
No. Did you?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.161
No.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.832
So this game was

21:28.454 --> 21:31.832
to teach us a lesson.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.333
And you know what?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.920
We needed one.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.547
I think we owe them

21:35.962 --> 21:38.547
a couple of thousand thank yous.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.056
We really blew it today.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.434
You guys do so much

21:47.098 --> 21:50.434
and you're so wonderful

21:50.476 --> 21:53.062
and sometimes we just

21:50.476 --> 21:53.062
expect you to be wonderful

21:53.104 --> 21:55.815
and we forget to tell

21:53.104 --> 21:55.815
you how much we appreciate

21:55.856 --> 21:58.400
how wonderful you are.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.194
What we're trying to say is..

22:00.236 --> 22:02.822
...you guys

22:00.236 --> 22:02.822
are really wonderful.

22:02.863 --> 22:07.493
And I just wanna say,

22:02.863 --> 22:07.493
"thank you." Thanks.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.121
Hey, pal, good going.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.625
Way to go, chum.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.625
<i>Muchas gracias, amigo.</i>

22:14.667 --> 22:16.961
Steph, just hug 'em.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.046
Thank you.
