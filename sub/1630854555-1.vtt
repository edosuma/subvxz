NARRATOR:
'Twas the night before Christmas,

00:24.292 --> 00:26.583
and I've got a tale to tell.

00:26.583 --> 00:31.208
In the very near future,
things have all gone to hell.

00:31.208 --> 00:35.833
In 2027, it was made illegal
to take drugs or to drink.

00:35.833 --> 00:39.333
A puff, sniff, or sip
will land you straight in the clink.

00:40.167 --> 00:43.708
Except for one night,
The Binge, as it's known,

00:43.708 --> 00:47.875
where it's perfectly legal
to get drunk, high, or stoned.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.833
But something else happened
that no one could anticipate.

00:51.833 --> 00:56.042
Spending Christmas with family sober
would make you irate.

00:56.042 --> 00:58.625
So this year they did
what you wouldn't believe.

00:58.625 --> 01:02.000
They brilliantly moved
The Binge to Christmas Eve.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.958
So grab some mistletoe, kids,
and prepare to get hyped.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.833
A Merry Bingemas to all,

01:07.833 --> 01:10.667

I know it's been hard holding off
being intimate with my daughter.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.625
- Yeah, right. [laughs]

10:17.333 --> 10:18.833
Yeah, right!

10:18.833 --> 10:21.042
Yeah-- Yeah, we're waiting until marriage.

10:21.042 --> 10:23.000
We might even wait
a couple years after marriage.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.375
We could just
love each other from a distance.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.708
But since you brought up marriage though,

10:27.708 --> 10:30.458
uh, I wanted to ask you, Mr. Martin--

10:30.458 --> 10:33.250
- Oh, no, please.
Mr. Martin was my father.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.250
I'm Dr. Martin.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.208
One of the first things
I learned in medical school

10:36.208 --> 10:39.167
is how to cut through the bone
cleanly and swiftly.

10:39.167 --> 10:40.167
- You're a foot doctor.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.458
- Feet have bones, Hags!

10:42.458 --> 10:45.083
That's the second thing
I learned in medical school.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.500
Let me show you.
[chainsaw buzzing]

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
- Please don't.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.708
- Hags hasn't been Hags lately.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.667
He's been acting, like, super weird.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.292
Has Andrew said anything about him?

10:55.292 --> 10:59.333
- Andrew and I had a conscious uncoupling.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.792
- How is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

11:01.792 --> 11:04.167
- Well, we haven't really talked
since I've been away at college.

11:04.167 --> 11:06.625
And to be honest,
as insufferable as my mom is,

11:06.625 --> 11:08.875
she did offer to give me a job.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.667
And she thinks
that Andrew could ruin her image,

11:13.458 --> 11:15.083
mainly his two dads.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.542
- So what?
Literally, everyone's parents are gay now.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.875
If anything, I think
that'll help her win the election.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.750
- No, like, he literally has two dads.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.167
He's a twin from two separate fathers.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.458
It's-- It's actually pretty common.

11:26.458 --> 11:29.542
His mom had sex with two men
in a short window of time

11:29.542 --> 11:31.583
who got her pregnant at the same time.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.333

knocked into one or another,

11:36.333 --> 11:38.250

for the price of one, even if...

11:41.458 --> 11:42.667

11:48.458 --> 11:51.375
- Dad? Did someone say my name?

11:51.375 --> 11:52.750
- No, nobody said your name.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.708
- If I remember correctly,
it's almost time for me and your brother

11:55.708 --> 11:59.125
to make you eat
all the tinsel off the Christmas tree.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.625
ANDREW:
I-- I haven't--

12:00.625 --> 12:03.167
I haven't eaten all the tinsel
from the Christmas tree in-- in years.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.083

it's always sad to see a tradition die.

12:26.417 --> 12:29.958

a lactose intolerance, Rigo.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.750
- Oh, yeah. Hector,
that excuse ain't gonna fly on The Binge.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.917
Tonight, all the rules are out the window!

12:34.917 --> 12:38.083

how irritable bowel syndrome works.

was said about bunnies and Easter,

to have moved past it.

- Where the hell are you going?

37:58.083 --> 38:01.583
- I told Andrew that I would stop by
and see him and-- and see his family.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.583
I promised him I'll be there.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.667
- You hate Andrew's family.
- Kind of, yes, honey.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.292
But I really need to go.
- On Christmas Eve?

38:06.292 --> 38:07.333
- I need you to trust me.

38:07.833 --> 38:11.167
This will all make sense in a little bit.
I love you.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.458
I'll see you in a minute. Thank you.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.958
- Are you looking for... this?

38:21.500 --> 38:24.917
- No! Why would I be looking
for a VHS copy of Con Air?

38:24.917 --> 38:25.833
- What?

38:25.833 --> 38:27.667
We watched it every Christmas, remember?

38:27.667 --> 38:29.583
This is where
I learned to steal a cop car.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.208
- Oh, that's super cool, Uncle Kris.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.958
But I really need to find
this stupid fucking Christmas Owl

38:33.958 --> 38:35.833
or my mom will actually murder me.

38:35.833 --> 38:39.292
- Oh, I was thinking.
We should go to the Winter Wonderland.

38:39.292 --> 38:40.625
- That's a really great idea,

38:40.625 --> 38:43.208
but it actually isn't
because you shouldn't be in public.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.292
The cops are gonna see you.

38:44.708 --> 38:46.458
- That's the beauty of tonight.

38:46.458 --> 38:49.417
Because everyone's dressed like me,
so I'll blend right in.

38:51.458 --> 38:54.000
Hey, Kimmi, come here, will ya?
Got you something.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.667
- Oh, Uncle Kris.
I didn't really get you anything.

38:58.208 --> 38:59.250
- Merry Christmas.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.833
I had it taped to the wall of my cell
right next to my bed,

39:03.333 --> 39:07.208
and, um, I was remembering
when your dad passed away

39:07.208 --> 39:08.833
how hard it was on the family.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.625
And how your mom,

39:10.625 --> 39:12.875
you know, she just
kind of threw herself into her work

39:12.875 --> 39:16.000
and kind of at the expense
of your upbringing.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.833
So I just-- I don't know,

39:17.833 --> 39:21.333
I always kind of saw myself
as kind of a de facto dad,

39:21.333 --> 39:24.917
you know, even though I, you know,
I'm not the normal uncle or whatever.

39:24.917 --> 39:28.625
But I just wanted you
to know that I love you very much.

39:28.625 --> 39:31.250
And I'm really happy
to be with you on Christmas.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.458
And I, you know, I just wish

39:33.458 --> 39:35.958
everything could go back
to the way it used to be, you know?

39:36.625 --> 39:39.458
- I don't think
that's possible, Uncle Kris.

39:39.458 --> 39:41.792
- No, no, no. It is!
It is. I'm telling you!

39:41.792 --> 39:45.208
You know, everything's gonna
be totally normal from here on out.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.875
[doorbell rings]
Fuck! That's the cops. It's the cops.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.958
Okay. You haven't seen me.
You haven't seen me at all--

39:49.958 --> 39:53.167
Oh, no. You've seen me,
but I was far away. Just say that.

39:54.750 --> 39:55.750
- Okay.

39:57.125 --> 40:00.125
- That motherfucker
is cheating on me! I know it!

40:00.125 --> 40:02.625
- Who, Hags? No. [scoffs]
- Obviously!

40:02.625 --> 40:06.375
- He wouldn't cheat on you.
He is so, so, so scared of you, and--

40:06.375 --> 40:09.542
- Kimmi, is that your weird uncle
hiding behind the Christmas tree?

40:09.542 --> 40:11.458
- Oh, hey! Yeah.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.625
Merry Christmas.
You look good, look festive.

40:13.625 --> 40:15.833
You seem happy. How's your dad?

40:15.833 --> 40:18.542
- Uh, you know, staying out of jail.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.125
- No way! It's hard to do.
Trust me. [chuckles]

40:21.125 --> 40:23.917
So anyway, I'm gonna go
put some stuff on the sleigh.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.667
Christmas is right around the corner!

40:26.333 --> 40:30.333
Uh, anyway, you guys go back
to your girl problem. [laughs]

40:30.917 --> 40:33.292
Let me just say
from the bottom of my heart, Sarah,

40:33.292 --> 40:35.833
I'm so glad you're not the DEA. Seriously.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.208
- Right. Me too.
- Yeah.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.292
UNCLE KRIS:
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

40:40.250 --> 40:42.917
- Yeah, he used to dress like Santa
every Christmas,

40:42.917 --> 40:45.917
but somewhere down the road,
it became full-time.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.708
SARAH:
Some people are so crazy.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.750
Anyway, I have a tracker
on Hags' phone and iPad.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.708
I pinged all the cell towers
at every location he's been to today,

40:53.708 --> 40:55.708
cross-referenced it
with the location of his laptop,

40:55.708 --> 40:56.750
which I also have bugged,

40:56.750 --> 40:59.333
so triangulation
should be fairly straightforward.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.542
We need to follow him
and see where he's going.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.833
KIMMI:
Yeah, that's totally normal and healthy

41:03.833 --> 41:06.375
and not at all psychotic,
but, um, I can't.

41:06.375 --> 41:08.625
Uh, I have to be
at Winter Wonderland at 09:00,

41:08.625 --> 41:11.042
and I still need to find
this stupid fucking Christmas Owl.

41:11.042 --> 41:12.208
Otherwise, my mom--
- Oh, my God!

41:12.208 --> 41:14.083
There has to be something in here
that'll loosen you up.

41:14.083 --> 41:16.500
- I don't need to be loosened!
I'm not binging!

41:16.500 --> 41:19.750
We actually are
a very upstanding family, okay?

41:19.750 --> 41:25.375
- Okay! Ladies, ladies.
Hey, everything's totally fine.

41:25.375 --> 41:27.708
You know what?
It's more than fine. Merry Christmas!

41:27.708 --> 41:31.125
It's just-- The neighbors, I think,
recognized me and called the cops

41:31.125 --> 41:32.750
while I was decorating my sleigh.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.208
- The squad car he stole.

41:34.208 --> 41:35.083
- Right.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.708
- Look, again, everything's totally fine.

41:36.708 --> 41:39.458
We just probably wanna leave
within the next two or three minutes,

41:39.458 --> 41:42.583
or there's gonna be
a lot of angry banter over a megaphone

41:42.583 --> 41:45.917
and, uh, I dunno, possible gunfire.
Maybe. I don't know.

1:31:07.208 --> 1:31:10.000
You want a family of your own,
and guess what?

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.667
[gasps] They're right over there.

1:31:12.667 --> 1:31:17.167
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine kids.

1:31:17.792 --> 1:31:20.708
- [gasps] Plus the two of us!

1:31:22.333 --> 1:31:27.000
- Baby, we finally got
our very own Ocean's Eleven.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.167
We'll take 'em all.

1:31:28.875 --> 1:31:31.792
- That's, literally,
never going to happen.

1:31:31.792 --> 1:31:33.917
- Well, we've already started
naming them, so.

1:31:33.917 --> 1:31:34.917

1:31:47.875 --> 1:31:49.333

DEIDRE: What?

1:31:52.917 --> 1:31:57.792
What is-- What the fuck are you doing?
- You are the best thing.

1:31:57.792 --> 1:31:59.333
- Are you proposing?

1:31:59.333 --> 1:32:01.333
I am not getting married again!

1:32:01.333 --> 1:32:04.833

Hey, don't you talk to me like that!

1:32:04.833 --> 1:32:07.167

1:32:12.042 --> 1:32:13.667

1:32:41.292 --> 1:32:43.042
- Hags proposed to Sarah.

1:32:44.042 --> 1:32:45.500
ANDREW:

1:32:46.083 --> 1:32:49.083

Glad you finally got your wings.
Love, Santa. Ho!

1:33:17.167 --> 1:33:18.542
- I'll be damned.

1:33:18.542 --> 1:33:22.958
Almost makes going to jail
for killing 26 people worth it.
