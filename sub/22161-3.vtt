WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:04.462
{\an7}&gt;&gt; OUR SENIOR YEAR IN

00:04.546 --> 00:05.588
{\an7}LAGUNA BEACH WASN'T EXACTLY

00:05.672 --> 00:06.756
{\an7}GOING SMOOTHLY.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.966
{\an7}MORGAN GOT REJECTED FROM THE

00:08.048 --> 00:09.175
{\an7}ONLY COLLEGE SHE APPLIED TO.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.301
{\an7}&gt;&gt; I'M NOT STAYING HERE, I'M NOT

00:10.385 --> 00:11.720
{\an7}GONNA STAY IN LAGUNA BEACH.

00:11.803 --> 00:12.971
{\an7}&gt;&gt; AND STEPHEN WAS BEGINNING TO

00:13.054 --> 00:13.596
{\an7}FIND OUT HE WASN'T THE ONLY GUY

00:13.680 --> 00:15.140
{\an7}IN KRISTIN'S LIFE.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.391
{\an7}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S UP, SAM?

00:16.474 --> 00:17.517
{\an7}&gt;&gt; HE TRIED TALKING TO HER

00:17.600 --> 00:18.518
{\an7}AT THE BONFIRE...

00:18.601 --> 00:19.519
{\an7}&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANNA

00:19.602 --> 00:20.770
{\an7}TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.855
{\an7}&gt;&gt; BUT TYPICAL KRISTIN,

00:21.938 --> 00:22.480
{\an7}SHE JUST TURNED AND WALKED AWAY.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.399
{\an7}WITH KRISTIN OUT OF THE PICTURE,

00:24.482 --> 00:25.567
{\an7}IT LOOKED LIKE STEPHEN AND I

00:25.650 --> 00:26.776
{\an7}COULD HANG OUT AGAIN.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.902
{\an7}&gt;&gt; STEPHEN, IF YOU WANTED

00:27.986 --> 00:28.486
{\an7}SOMEONE, YOU COULD HAVE THEM.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.612
{\an7}&gt;&gt; BUT YET ANOTHER GIRL

00:29.696 --> 00:30.572
{\an7}WAS ABOUT TO CATCH

00:30.655 --> 00:32.156
{\an7}STEPHEN'S ATTENTION.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.450
{\an7}AND MEANWHILE, KRISTIN ONLY HAD

00:33.533 --> 00:34.200
{\an7}TWO THINGS ON HER MIND,

00:34.284 --> 00:36.828
{\an7}SCORING A NEW CAR,

00:36.911 --> 00:39.497
{\an7}AND A JUNIOR NAMED SAM.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.790
{\an7}&gt;&gt; SO, ALL RIGHT,

00:40.874 --> 00:42.041
{\an7}I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.126
{\an7}DO YOU THINK I COULD PERSUADE

00:43.209 --> 00:45.754
{\an7}DAD INTO GETTING ME A NEW CAR?

00:45.837 --> 00:46.296
{\an7}&gt;&gt; KEEP DREAMING.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.297
{\an7}&gt;&gt; WHY?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.174
{\an7}SERIOUSLY, THE CAR

00:49.257 --> 00:50.175
{\an7}IS FALLING APART.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.259
{\an7}YOU HAD IT, YOU KNOW.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.594
{\an7}&gt;&gt; KRISTIN, YOU'VE SCREWED

00:52.677 --> 00:53.470
{\an7}THAT CAR UP MORE THAN I DID.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.721
{\an7}&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, I'VE DINGED IT

00:54.804 --> 00:55.847
{\an7}A FEW TIMES, BUT YOU LIKE,

00:55.930 --> 00:56.639
{\an7}YOU NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION

00:56.723 --> 00:58.141
{\an7}AND STUFF BECAUSE YOU'VE

00:58.224 --> 00:59.142
{\an7}MESSED IT UP.

00:59.225 --> 00:59.768
{\an7}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T DO THAT.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.269
{\an7}&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU HAD TO GET

01:01.352 --> 01:02.187
{\an7}A NEW TRANSMISSION.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.104
{\an7}&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:03.188 --> 01:04.188
{\an7}OF ME, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE

01:04.272 --> 01:05.147
{\an7}THE CAR IS OLD.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.316
{\an7}&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, THE CAR IS OLD AND

01:06.399 --> 01:07.442
{\an7}THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO.

01:07.525 --> 01:08.610
{\an7}&gt;&gt; NO, THAT CAR IS FINE.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.778
