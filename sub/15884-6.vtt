WEBVTT

00:00.163 --> 00:01.924
I am here
with Ozamataz Buckshank,

00:01.929 --> 00:03.843
the rookie
out of Stanford University

00:03.902 --> 00:07.110
who is undoubtedly the MVP
of today's game

00:07.167 --> 00:09.397
with an interception that
he runs back for a touchdown

00:09.445 --> 00:11.886
in the last 30 seconds
of the contest.

00:11.921 --> 00:14.464
Ozamataz, can you walk us
through what happened

00:14.498 --> 00:15.596
in that last play?

00:15.631 --> 00:16.996
- It was amazing.
- Yeah, we knew we had to go

00:17.031 --> 00:19.400
out there, give 100%,
and we executed.

00:19.434 --> 00:20.635
It just went our way today.

00:20.669 --> 00:22.102
And was the quarterback
giving you

00:22.136 --> 00:24.201
any clues today, Oz?

00:24.236 --> 00:25.520
It looked like you knew
that ball was gonna be there.

00:25.545 --> 00:26.733
What was happening?

00:26.767 --> 00:29.667
We wanted to have some fun,
you know, execute.

00:29.701 --> 00:32.101
Play one quarter at a time,
give 100%.

00:32.136 --> 00:34.104
Oh--okay, okay.
You know, let's just--

00:34.138 --> 00:35.404
Let's talk
about last week's game.

00:35.438 --> 00:37.973
You guys lost a heartbreaker.

00:38.007 --> 00:40.676
Give me your state of mind,
then versus now.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.410
We wanted
to do it play by play,

00:42.444 --> 00:44.644
give it 100%,
execution-wise.

00:44.679 --> 00:46.712
- Execute.
- Okay.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.213
I'm gonna ask you something
completely different

00:48.248 --> 00:49.214
that's not about football.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.215
Look at me, Oz.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.416
just look at me for a second.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.451
I'm gonna ask you a question
right here.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.886
That a boy.
So you and your wife

00:53.920 --> 00:55.154
recently had--
right here.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.355
Stay with me.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.423
You and your wife
recently had twins, okay?

00:58.457 --> 01:00.224
How does it feel
to be a new dad?

01:00.259 --> 01:02.693
You know, we wanted to stay
As a team, execute,

01:02.727 --> 01:04.994
give 100%,
play by play.

01:05.028 --> 01:07.330
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna just--I'm just gonna--

01:07.364 --> 01:09.232
I'm gonna do a little test
right now.

01:09.266 --> 01:11.632
Hey, Oz, how'd you get
to the <i>game</i> today?

01:11.667 --> 01:16.135
They a good team,
great team, 100%.

01:16.169 --> 01:17.936
And what'd you have
for dinner last night?

01:17.970 --> 01:19.138
- 100%.
- 100%. Yeah, you did.

01:19.172 --> 01:21.975
Of course.
100% of whatever 100% was.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.244
You know what,
can you just do me a favor

01:24.278 --> 01:25.945
and tell me
one specific thing?

01:25.979 --> 01:30.249
Like, just <i>one</i> actual, original
observation that you had

01:30.284 --> 01:32.317
about today's game?

01:32.352 --> 01:35.653
The game that you won
almost single-handedly.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.155
Do you think
that you could do that, Oz?

01:37.189 --> 01:39.457
- Oh, 100%.
- Oh, God damn it!

meet in comic books

You know--if you're
a comic book fan. Yeah.

02:26.302 --> 02:27.636
They always meet,
and it's like they're equals.

Yeah.
They're not equals.

02:28.972 --> 02:30.205
They're not equals.
No.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.774
They're, like,
if they're on a stakeout,

Of Gotham?

02:45.189 --> 02:46.322
- Yes.
- The city?

02:46.356 --> 02:48.057
Yeah, I was gonna get
in my Batwing...

02:48.091 --> 02:49.191
- Cool.
- and you and I could travel

fly through the sky.

02:50.593 --> 02:51.627
Oh, we don't need that.

02:51.661 --> 02:54.196
Just, what, you want
to climb on top?

02:54.230 --> 02:56.865
Come on.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.734
Get up on it.

02:58.769 --> 03:01.237

Hello, Skymall Magazine,

03:15.317 --> 03:16.584
this is Riyaz speaking.

03:16.619 --> 03:20.254
Hello, Riyaz.
I would like to report

03:20.288 --> 03:23.990
an item which I ordered
that arrived broken.

03:24.025 --> 03:26.794
Wendell Sanders,
Mockingbird Lane.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.495
That's right.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.564
I am showing the last item
that you received

03:30.598 --> 03:33.600
is the Superman bed
with the Mattress of Solitude.

03:33.634 --> 03:34.801
That's the one.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.736
Ordered it for my son
for his birthday,

03:36.771 --> 03:39.272
but I cannot give it to him
like this.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.607
And I'm pretty darn-tootin'
pissed about it.

03:41.642 --> 03:42.909
I'm really sorry, sir.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.711
I will start processing
your reorder right now

03:45.746 --> 03:47.213
with you on the line, okay?

03:47.247 --> 03:49.215
I ain't mad at you, Riyaz.

03:49.249 --> 03:51.050
It's just the system.
I know.

03:51.084 --> 03:53.185
Okay. thank you
for understanding, sir.

03:53.219 --> 03:54.652
Kids, eh?

03:54.687 --> 03:56.921
Huh?

03:56.955 --> 04:01.192
Oh, ki--well, yeah,
I just got the one myself.

04:01.226 --> 04:04.361
Had sex with a woman
and everything to get him.

04:04.396 --> 04:05.663
How long is this gonna--

04:05.697 --> 04:06.864
What is your son's name?

04:06.898 --> 04:12.369
Oh, um...

04:12.404 --> 04:15.706
Stimpy.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.474
Pretty much Stimpy.

04:17.509 --> 04:18.608
I have boys too.

04:18.642 --> 04:20.209
I'll tell you,
sometimes they can be

04:20.244 --> 04:21.911
a real couple
of you know whats.

04:21.946 --> 04:23.046
[bleep] ass[bleep]?

04:23.081 --> 04:25.148
<i>You're preaching
to the choir, Riyaz.</i>

04:25.183 --> 04:28.252
Stimpy, don't you give me
that look.

04:28.286 --> 04:30.787
You're gonna get it
when your mama comes home.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.989
Oh, my,
sounds like your wife is...

04:33.024 --> 04:35.792
Bitch on wheels.
You got that straight, Riyaz.

04:35.827 --> 04:38.228
Hot little biscuit, though.

04:38.262 --> 04:39.563
Name's Claire.

04:39.597 --> 04:41.432
Body: ten,
face: ten.

04:41.466 --> 04:45.203
So pretty much hit that
every night.

04:45.237 --> 04:47.371
Sexually.

04:47.406 --> 04:49.474
Anyway,
what's holding up the--

04:49.508 --> 04:51.009
Oh, one moment.

04:51.043 --> 04:54.011
And how old is your son?

04:54.046 --> 04:57.382
- 15.
- <i>15?</i>

04:57.416 --> 05:00.018
And he still wants
a Superman bed.

05:00.052 --> 05:03.021
<i>Ah, a late-bloomer.</i>

05:03.055 --> 05:05.290
Enjoy it
while you still can.

05:05.324 --> 05:07.492
He'll grow out of the toys
any day now.

05:07.526 --> 05:09.895
They all do,
and, the second

05:09.929 --> 05:11.496
he starts hooking up
with the girls,

05:11.531 --> 05:14.667
he'll forget all about that
Superman and Spider-Man stuff.

05:14.701 --> 05:17.403
Pretty much seems
like how it would happen.

05:17.438 --> 05:18.904
Maybe then
he'll stop bothering me

05:18.939 --> 05:22.141
with all those stupid, little
facts about how those characters

05:22.176 --> 05:24.277
you just named are clearly
from two distinct

05:24.311 --> 05:26.379
and separate universes.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.980
Sadly, some people
never move on.

05:28.014 --> 05:30.015
Sad?
I got a better word for you.

05:30.049 --> 05:31.016
Pathetic.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.851
<i>Well,
I wouldn't say pathetic.</i>

05:32.885 --> 05:36.221
Hey, I calls 'em
likes I sees 'em, Riyaz,

05:36.255 --> 05:39.024
and I don'st tolerate nerds.

05:39.058 --> 05:40.926
In fact, let me nip this
in the bud real quick.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.129
Stimpy, Stimpy,
get back in here.

05:44.164 --> 05:45.731
- Well, I didn't mean to--
- <i>There you are</i>

05:45.765 --> 05:49.434
with your round body
and your creepy-ass face.

05:49.469 --> 05:52.071
No more sweets for you, 'cause
you're never gonna get laid

05:52.105 --> 05:53.872
if you keeps eating sweets!

05:53.907 --> 05:56.175
<i>And another thing!</i>

05:56.209 --> 06:00.179
All these figurines and toys
you got around the house,

06:00.213 --> 06:01.780
we're throwing 'em
in the trash,

06:01.814 --> 06:03.682
'cause they're not real people,
Stimpy.

06:03.716 --> 06:06.885
They're not real people,
so stop being so lonely.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.255
Stop being so lonely.

06:14.928 --> 06:19.231
Well--and this is none
of my business, of course,

06:19.265 --> 06:25.237
but I was wondering if your son
would like to talk to someone.

06:25.271 --> 06:26.972
(glass shattering)
Oh, [bleep]!

06:27.006 --> 06:28.373
Stimpy just jumped
out the window.

06:28.407 --> 06:30.741
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, he killed himself.

06:30.776 --> 06:32.042
Why'd he do it?
It must have been my fault.

06:32.076 --> 06:33.043
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.

06:33.077 --> 06:34.210
I'm gonna call the cops.

06:34.245 --> 06:35.679
Don't you dare cancel
that reorder.

06:35.713 --> 06:39.115
It's the only thing
I'll have to remember him by.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.655
(strains,
then sighs)

06:48.954 --> 06:52.357
Hey, you remember
the anti-drug advertisements?

06:52.391 --> 06:54.058
- Yes.
- This is my favorite

06:54.093 --> 06:55.059
anti-drug ad.

06:55.094 --> 06:58.329
My favorite anti-drug ad was...

06:58.364 --> 07:00.698
"What is this?

07:00.733 --> 07:03.801
What is this, son?"
(laughter)

07:03.835 --> 07:07.304
You know.
"Found this in your room.

07:07.338 --> 07:10.507
"Marijuana!

07:10.542 --> 07:12.009
"Who taught you to do this?"

07:12.044 --> 07:15.480
"I learned it
from watching you, dad!"

07:15.514 --> 07:20.585
(cheers and applause)

07:26.058 --> 07:28.125
If you're 14 and you see that,
where I'm from,

07:28.160 --> 07:29.760
You go, "That's the coolest dad
in the world."

07:29.794 --> 07:32.563
That's the coolest dad.

07:38.636 --> 07:40.571

Well, you're a different color
than me,

07:42.608 --> 07:43.975
and that's bad.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.978
Oh, yeah?
Well, you dress like--

Now hold on a second!

07:48.148 --> 07:51.283
(both) Whoa!
Mr. T?

07:51.317 --> 07:53.251
Never make fun
of a way a man dresses.

07:53.286 --> 07:55.454
The way a man dresses
is his business.

07:55.488 --> 07:57.089
Remember that.

chains,

07:59.092 --> 08:01.560

it's not to be joked about.

another man's clothing.

Hey, Scout, there's a man
over there

08:20.545 --> 08:22.546
who said he'll give us candy
if we get in his van.

08:22.581 --> 08:25.215
Oh, I don't know
If that's a good idea, Timmy.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.051
What are you afraid of?

08:27.085 --> 08:29.853
Is it because you have
a stupid name like Scout?

08:29.888 --> 08:34.024
- Hey!
- (both) Whoa! Mr. T again.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.592
Never make fun
of a person's name.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.294
Your mama gave you
that name,

08:37.328 --> 08:39.629
or you made it up
for business purposes.

08:39.663 --> 08:41.663
Either way, it's personal.

08:41.698 --> 08:44.299
I pity the fool that make fun
of another man's name.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.569
Mr. T's a cool name.
It's a cool name, Mr. T.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.110
Hey, Scout,
want to do some drugs?

08:55.144 --> 08:57.745
Aren't drugs bad?

08:57.780 --> 09:00.014
I don't know.

09:03.352 --> 09:04.452
If you're afraid of drugs,

09:04.486 --> 09:07.154
we could drink
a bunch of alcohol.

09:07.189 --> 09:09.757
Yum, that sounds good.

09:14.862 --> 09:17.965
Well, guess what,
your hair is stupid.

09:17.999 --> 09:20.267
Never make fun

- A person's hair

09:23.138 --> 09:25.973

Flaps everywhere.
A world of flaps.

14:33.027 --> 14:35.161
And you need to lick your way
out the factory.

14:35.195 --> 14:36.863
But every bitch's flaps

Every flap

Our top story--
ninja costumes don't come

Do you know what?
Forget about the teleprompter.

just don't say [bleep]

16:08.776 --> 16:10.644
This is what happened to me.
Just be the woman.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.212

Hey, Jordan.

16:12.246 --> 16:14.147

"Oh, congratulations."

I don't care

16:25.227 --> 16:26.393
how many signals I get,

16:26.428 --> 16:28.996
I just won't even say anything.

18:12.771 --> 18:15.206
Look at that pink shirt
you got on there.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.877
Wow, where'd you get that?
Queertshirts.com?

18:19.912 --> 18:24.215
It's in support
Of breast cancer awareness.

18:24.249 --> 18:26.750
I am gay, though.

18:26.785 --> 18:27.818
Okay.

18:27.852 --> 18:28.919
Go for it.

18:28.954 --> 18:31.288
I can take it.

18:31.322 --> 18:34.190
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:34.225 --> 18:36.926
No, hey, yeah, don't you worry
about that, man.

18:36.961 --> 18:38.328
Gloves are coming off.

18:38.362 --> 18:41.365
Okay.

18:41.399 --> 18:44.802
Right there, right there, what's
with the three drinks, man?

18:44.836 --> 18:46.971
Alcoholic much?

18:47.005 --> 18:49.507
This
is my pain medication.

18:49.541 --> 18:51.909
Of [bleep] course it is.

18:51.943 --> 18:53.777
It's your pain medication.

18:53.812 --> 18:58.350
'cause he is in pain.

18:58.384 --> 19:00.085
Right now.

19:00.119 --> 19:04.623
Make fun of the burns.

19:04.657 --> 19:06.558
Make fun of the--
What did you say?

19:06.593 --> 19:10.496
Because here's the problem, sir,
is it's really dark in here,

19:10.530 --> 19:12.464
and, sorry, are you burned?
Because I can't make it out.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.266
Thanks so much, ma'am,
for illuminating him.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.569
Thank you.
That's--I appreciate that.

19:17.604 --> 19:21.874
- Oh, those burns.
- Make fun of the robot voice.

19:21.908 --> 19:23.943
Sir, I don't know.

19:23.977 --> 19:25.445
Come on,
I can take it.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.481
Okay, well, no,
You know what?

19:27.515 --> 19:28.949
- I feel--
- Or the wheelchair.

19:28.983 --> 19:31.818
Look, sir,
there is nothing funny

19:31.852 --> 19:33.553
about you being
in a wheelchair,

19:33.587 --> 19:35.755
- and we can all--
- Oh, but there is something

19:35.789 --> 19:38.357
funny about me being fat?

19:38.391 --> 19:39.825
- All right.
All right, fine.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.093
Fine. I've got it.
I've got it.

19:41.128 --> 19:42.561
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

19:42.596 --> 19:43.963
I just didn't want to go
after this guy

19:43.997 --> 19:48.501
'cause I didn't want him
to kill me in my dreams.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.203
Like Freddy Krueger.

19:50.237 --> 19:51.504
(exclamations)

19:51.539 --> 19:52.806
Come on.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.507
'cause--no?

19:54.542 --> 19:58.544
You know, 'cause how Freddy
Krueger's face is burned off.

19:58.579 --> 20:00.981
That's not...

20:01.015 --> 20:04.017
(sobs)

20:10.458 --> 20:15.061
- You ass[bleep].
- He said he could take it.

20:15.095 --> 20:16.129
That's what he said.

20:16.163 --> 20:18.598
I thought I could,
but I can't.

20:18.632 --> 20:20.100
How is this on me?

20:20.134 --> 20:22.268
How do we even know
if he's crying right now?

20:22.303 --> 20:25.237
(all booing)

20:25.272 --> 20:27.106
I don't know that sound.

20:27.140 --> 20:29.574
It just sounds
like an electronic sound.

20:29.609 --> 20:33.345
The tears,
they burn.

20:33.379 --> 20:37.482
He said he could take it.
He s--

20:37.516 --> 20:39.917
(cheers and applause)

20:41.420 --> 20:44.222
Fellows, gentlemen,
it's time for you to go home

20:44.257 --> 20:45.357
and practice on a peach.

20:45.391 --> 20:46.558
Take a peach and practice.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.260
(both) Take a peach
and practice.

20:48.294 --> 20:49.895
- There you go.
- There's a peach for you.

20:49.929 --> 20:51.229
- Take a peach and practice.
- Peach.

20:51.264 --> 20:54.599
- Peach.
- Got one? Got one?

20:54.633 --> 20:57.410
