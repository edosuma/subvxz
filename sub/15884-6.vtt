WEBVTT

00:00.163 --> 00:01.924
I am here
with Ozamataz Buckshank,

00:01.929 --> 00:03.843
the rookie
out of Stanford University

00:03.902 --> 00:07.110
who is undoubtedly the MVP
of today's game

00:07.167 --> 00:09.397
with an interception that
he runs back for a touchdown

00:09.445 --> 00:11.886
in the last 30 seconds
of the contest.

00:11.921 --> 00:14.464
Ozamataz, can you walk us
through what happened

00:14.498 --> 00:15.596
in that last play?

00:15.631 --> 00:16.996
- It was amazing.
- Yeah, we knew we had to go

00:17.031 --> 00:19.400
out there, give 100%,
and we executed.

00:19.434 --> 00:20.635
It just went our way today.

00:20.669 --> 00:22.102
And was the quarterback
giving you

00:22.136 --> 00:24.201
any clues today, Oz?

00:24.236 --> 00:25.520
It looked like you knew
that ball was gonna be there.

00:25.545 --> 00:26.733
What was happening?

00:26.767 --> 00:29.667
We wanted to have some fun,
you know, execute.

00:29.701 --> 00:32.101
Play one quarter at a time,
give 100%.

00:32.136 --> 00:34.104
Oh--okay, okay.
You know, let's just--

00:34.138 --> 00:35.404
Let's talk
about last week's game.

00:35.438 --> 00:37.973
You guys lost a heartbreaker.

00:38.007 --> 00:40.676
Give me your state of mind,
then versus now.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.410
We wanted
to do it play by play,

00:42.444 --> 00:44.644
give it 100%,
execution-wise.

00:44.679 --> 00:46.712
- Execute.
- Okay.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.213
I'm gonna ask you something
completely different

00:48.248 --> 00:49.214
that's not about football.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.215
Look at me, Oz.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.416
just look at me for a second.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.451
I'm gonna ask you a question
right here.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.886
That a boy.
So you and your wife

00:53.920 --> 00:55.154
recently had--
right here.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.355
Stay with me.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.423
You and your wife
recently had twins, okay?

00:58.457 --> 01:00.224
How does it feel
to be a new dad?

01:00.259 --> 01:02.693
You know, we wanted to stay
As a team, execute,

01:02.727 --> 01:04.994
give 100%,
play by play.

01:05.028 --> 01:07.330
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna just--I'm just gonna--

01:07.364 --> 01:09.232
I'm gonna do a little test
right now.

01:09.266 --> 01:11.632
Hey, Oz, how'd you get
to the <i>game</i> today?

01:11.667 --> 01:16.135
They a good team,
great team, 100%.

01:16.169 --> 01:17.936
And what'd you have
for dinner last night?

01:17.970 --> 01:19.138
- 100%.
- 100%. Yeah, you did.

01:19.172 --> 01:21.975
Of course.
100% of whatever 100% was.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.244
You know what,
can you just do me a favor

01:24.278 --> 01:25.945
and tell me
one specific thing?

01:25.979 --> 01:30.249
Like, just <i>one</i> actual, original
observation that you had

01:30.284 --> 01:32.317
about today's game?

01:32.352 --> 01:35.653
The game that you won
almost single-handedly.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.155
Do you think
that you could do that, Oz?

01:37.189 --> 01:39.457
- Oh, 100%.
- Oh, God damn it!

01:39.491 --> 01:42.460

02:00.511 --> 02:02.646
- Hey.
- All right.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.949
Thank you.

02:08.185 --> 02:10.586
- All right.
- Thank you, everybody, so much.

02:10.621 --> 02:12.255
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome.

02:12.289 --> 02:14.389
- I am Keegan-Michael Key.
- I'm Jordan Peele.

02:14.424 --> 02:17.693
And we are Key and Peele.
(cheers and applause)

02:17.727 --> 02:19.361
Thank you.

02:19.396 --> 02:21.663
You guys know when Superman
and Batman

02:21.698 --> 02:23.765
meet in comic books
and TV shows?

02:23.800 --> 02:26.268
You know--if you're
a comic book fan. Yeah.

02:26.302 --> 02:27.636
They always meet,
and it's like they're equals.

02:27.670 --> 02:28.937
Yeah.
They're not equals.

02:28.972 --> 02:30.205
They're not equals.
No.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.774
They're, like,
if they're on a stakeout,

02:31.809 --> 02:33.443
like, what's Batman
supposed to do?

02:33.478 --> 02:35.746
(raspy)
There are the bad guys.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.180
I'll use my utility belt
Freeze--

02:37.214 --> 02:38.348
(whoops)
Got 'em.

02:38.382 --> 02:41.517
Okay.
(laughter)

02:42.886 --> 02:44.153
I'm gonna give you a tour
of Gotham.

02:44.188 --> 02:45.154
Please.
Of Gotham?

02:45.189 --> 02:46.322
- Yes.
- The city?

02:46.356 --> 02:48.057
Yeah, I was gonna get
in my Batwing...

02:48.091 --> 02:49.191
- Cool.
- and you and I could travel

02:49.226 --> 02:50.559
around,
fly through the sky.

02:50.593 --> 02:51.627
Oh, we don't need that.

02:51.661 --> 02:54.196
Just, what, you want
to climb on top?

02:54.230 --> 02:56.865
Come on.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.734
Get up on it.

02:58.769 --> 03:01.237
Jump up on it.

03:01.271 --> 03:03.739
Come on.
There you go.

03:05.108 --> 03:07.810
Is that--
Is that your utility belt

03:07.844 --> 03:10.145
I'm feeling?

03:11.481 --> 03:13.848
(phone rings)

03:13.883 --> 03:15.283
Hello, Skymall Magazine,

03:15.317 --> 03:16.584
this is Riyaz speaking.

03:16.619 --> 03:20.254
Hello, Riyaz.
I would like to report

03:20.288 --> 03:23.990
an item which I ordered
that arrived broken.

03:24.025 --> 03:26.794
Wendell Sanders,
Mockingbird Lane.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.495
That's right.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.564
I am showing the last item
that you received

03:30.598 --> 03:33.600
is the Superman bed
with the Mattress of Solitude.

03:33.634 --> 03:34.801
That's the one.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.736
Ordered it for my son
for his birthday,

03:36.771 --> 03:39.272
but I cannot give it to him
like this.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.607
And I'm pretty darn-tootin'
pissed about it.

03:41.642 --> 03:42.909
I'm really sorry, sir.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.711
I will start processing
your reorder right now

03:45.746 --> 03:47.213
with you on the line, okay?

03:47.247 --> 03:49.215
I ain't mad at you, Riyaz.

03:49.249 --> 03:51.050
It's just the system.
I know.

03:51.084 --> 03:53.185
Okay. thank you
for understanding, sir.

03:53.219 --> 03:54.652
Kids, eh?

03:54.687 --> 03:56.921
Huh?

03:56.955 --> 04:01.192
Oh, ki--well, yeah,
I just got the one myself.

04:01.226 --> 04:04.361
Had sex with a woman
and everything to get him.

04:04.396 --> 04:05.663
How long is this gonna--

04:05.697 --> 04:06.864
What is your son's name?

04:06.898 --> 04:12.369
Oh, um...

04:12.404 --> 04:15.706
Stimpy.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.474
Pretty much Stimpy.

04:17.509 --> 04:18.608
I have boys too.

04:18.642 --> 04:20.209
I'll tell you,
sometimes they can be

04:20.244 --> 04:21.911
a real couple
of you know whats.

04:21.946 --> 04:23.046
[bleep] ass[bleep]?

04:23.081 --> 04:25.148
<i>You're preaching
to the choir, Riyaz.</i>

04:25.183 --> 04:28.252
Stimpy, don't you give me
that look.

04:28.286 --> 04:30.787
You're gonna get it
when your mama comes home.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.989
Oh, my,
sounds like your wife is...

04:33.024 --> 04:35.792
Bitch on wheels.
You got that straight, Riyaz.

04:35.827 --> 04:38.228
Hot little biscuit, though.

04:38.262 --> 04:39.563
Name's Claire.

04:39.597 --> 04:41.432
Body: ten,
face: ten.

04:41.466 --> 04:45.203
So pretty much hit that
every night.

04:45.237 --> 04:47.371
Sexually.

04:47.406 --> 04:49.474
Anyway,
what's holding up the--

04:49.508 --> 04:51.009
Oh, one moment.

04:51.043 --> 04:54.011
And how old is your son?

04:54.046 --> 04:57.382
- 15.
- <i>15?</i>

04:57.416 --> 05:00.018
And he still wants
a Superman bed.

05:00.052 --> 05:03.021
<i>Ah, a late-bloomer.</i>

05:03.055 --> 05:05.290
Enjoy it
while you still can.

05:05.324 --> 05:07.492
He'll grow out of the toys
any day now.

05:07.526 --> 05:09.895
They all do,
and, the second

05:09.929 --> 05:11.496
he starts hooking up
with the girls,

05:11.531 --> 05:14.667
he'll forget all about that
Superman and Spider-Man stuff.

05:14.701 --> 05:17.403
Pretty much seems
like how it would happen.

05:17.438 --> 05:18.904
Maybe then
he'll stop bothering me

05:18.939 --> 05:22.141
with all those stupid, little
facts about how those characters

05:22.176 --> 05:24.277
you just named are clearly
from two distinct

05:24.311 --> 05:26.379
and separate universes.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.980
Sadly, some people
never move on.

05:28.014 --> 05:30.015
Sad?
I got a better word for you.

05:30.049 --> 05:31.016
Pathetic.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.851
<i>Well,
I wouldn't say pathetic.</i>

05:32.885 --> 05:36.221
Hey, I calls 'em
likes I sees 'em, Riyaz,

05:36.255 --> 05:39.024
and I don'st tolerate nerds.

05:39.058 --> 05:40.926
In fact, let me nip this
in the bud real quick.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.129
Stimpy, Stimpy,
get back in here.

05:44.164 --> 05:45.731
- Well, I didn't mean to--
- <i>There you are</i>

05:45.765 --> 05:49.434
with your round body
and your creepy-ass face.

05:49.469 --> 05:52.071
No more sweets for you, 'cause
you're never gonna get laid

05:52.105 --> 05:53.872
if you keeps eating sweets!

05:53.907 --> 05:56.175
<i>And another thing!</i>

05:56.209 --> 06:00.179
All these figurines and toys
you got around the house,

06:00.213 --> 06:01.780
we're throwing 'em
in the trash,

06:01.814 --> 06:03.682
'cause they're not real people,
Stimpy.

06:03.716 --> 06:06.885
They're not real people,
so stop being so lonely.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.255
Stop being so lonely.

06:14.928 --> 06:19.231
Well--and this is none
of my business, of course,

06:19.265 --> 06:25.237
but I was wondering if your son
would like to talk to someone.

06:25.271 --> 06:26.972
(glass shattering)
Oh, [bleep]!

06:27.006 --> 06:28.373
Stimpy just jumped
out the window.

06:28.407 --> 06:30.741
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, he killed himself.

06:30.776 --> 06:32.042
Why'd he do it?
It must have been my fault.

06:32.076 --> 06:33.043
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.

06:33.077 --> 06:34.210
I'm gonna call the cops.

06:34.245 --> 06:35.679
Don't you dare cancel
that reorder.

06:35.713 --> 06:39.115
It's the only thing
I'll have to remember him by.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.655
(strains,
then sighs)

06:48.954 --> 06:52.357
Hey, you remember
the anti-drug advertisements?

06:52.391 --> 06:54.058
- Yes.
- This is my favorite

06:54.093 --> 06:55.059
anti-drug ad.

06:55.094 --> 06:58.329
My favorite anti-drug ad was...

06:58.364 --> 07:00.698
"What is this?

07:00.733 --> 07:03.801
What is this, son?"
(laughter)

07:03.835 --> 07:07.304
You know.
"Found this in your room.

07:07.338 --> 07:10.507
"Marijuana!

07:10.542 --> 07:12.009
"Who taught you to do this?"

07:12.044 --> 07:15.480
"I learned it
from watching you, dad!"

07:15.514 --> 07:20.585
(cheers and applause)

07:26.058 --> 07:28.125
If you're 14 and you see that,
where I'm from,

07:28.160 --> 07:29.760
You go, "That's the coolest dad
in the world."

07:29.794 --> 07:32.563
That's the coolest dad.

07:32.597 --> 07:35.566
(techno music)

07:35.600 --> 07:38.602
â™ª

07:38.636 --> 07:40.571
Nobody likes you, you girl.

07:40.605 --> 07:42.574
Well, you're a different color
than me,

07:42.608 --> 07:43.975
and that's bad.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.978
Oh, yeah?
Well, you dress like--

07:46.012 --> 07:48.113
Now hold on a second!

07:48.148 --> 07:51.283
(both) Whoa!
Mr. T?

07:51.317 --> 07:53.251
Never make fun
of a way a man dresses.

07:53.286 --> 07:55.454
The way a man dresses
is his business.

07:55.488 --> 07:57.089
Remember that.

07:57.123 --> 07:59.058
Whether it's overalls,
chains,

07:59.092 --> 08:01.560
or feather earrings,
however they dress,

08:01.595 --> 08:03.062
it's not to be joked about.

08:03.096 --> 08:08.567
I pity the fool that judges
another man's clothing.

08:08.602 --> 08:09.935
I'm sorry
I judged your clothing.

08:09.970 --> 08:12.438
It's okay.

08:12.472 --> 08:14.039
(upbeat music)

08:17.976 --> 08:20.511
Hey, Scout, there's a man
over there

08:20.545 --> 08:22.546
who said he'll give us candy
if we get in his van.

08:22.581 --> 08:25.215
Oh, I don't know
If that's a good idea, Timmy.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.051
What are you afraid of?

08:27.085 --> 08:29.853
Is it because you have
a stupid name like Scout?

08:29.888 --> 08:34.024
- Hey!
- (both) Whoa! Mr. T again.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.592
Never make fun
of a person's name.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.294
Your mama gave you
that name,

08:37.328 --> 08:39.629
or you made it up
for business purposes.

08:39.663 --> 08:41.663
Either way, it's personal.

08:41.698 --> 08:44.299
I pity the fool that make fun
of another man's name.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.569
Mr. T's a cool name.
It's a cool name, Mr. T.

08:47.603 --> 08:50.505
(upbeat music)

08:53.242 --> 08:55.110
Hey, Scout,
want to do some drugs?

08:55.144 --> 08:57.745
Aren't drugs bad?

08:57.780 --> 09:00.014
I don't know.

09:03.352 --> 09:04.452
If you're afraid of drugs,

09:04.486 --> 09:07.154
we could drink
a bunch of alcohol.

09:07.189 --> 09:09.757
Yum, that sounds good.

09:14.862 --> 09:17.965
Well, guess what,
your hair is stupid.

09:17.999 --> 09:20.267
Never make fun
of another person's hair!

09:20.302 --> 09:23.104
- (both) Hey, Mr. T.
- A person's hair

09:23.138 --> 09:25.973
is the artwork that they present
to the heavens.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.308
It's just like
I've been saying...

09:28.343 --> 09:31.878
(upbeat music)

09:31.913 --> 09:33.113
â™ª

09:33.147 --> 09:35.582
(All) â™ª Hair

09:35.617 --> 09:37.517
â™ª It isn't fair

09:37.552 --> 09:39.519
â™ª

09:39.553 --> 09:42.822
â™ª Beware

09:42.856 --> 09:44.857
â™ª People care
About their hair â™ª

09:44.891 --> 09:47.793
â™ª

09:47.828 --> 09:51.063
â™ª "H" is for the home
where I lay my head â™ª

09:51.097 --> 09:53.198
â™ª And I cry
about your mean jokes â™ª

09:53.233 --> 09:54.767
â™ª in my bed

09:54.801 --> 09:58.203
â™ª "A" is for anxiety
that fools provoke â™ª

09:58.237 --> 10:02.274
â™ª When they lookin' at my hair
and they makin' jokes â™ª

10:02.308 --> 10:05.911
â™ª "I" is for I don't like
the way I feel â™ª

10:05.945 --> 10:10.082
â™ª When you're jokin' that
my haircut does not appeal â™ª

10:10.116 --> 10:13.251
â™ª "R" is for the real mean jokes
you make â™ª

10:13.285 --> 10:18.223
â™ª And the hurtful
little potshots that you take â™ª

10:18.257 --> 10:20.959
And, for your information,
it's not even a haircut.

10:20.994 --> 10:24.630
It's a rare form
of male pattern baldness.

10:24.664 --> 10:27.566
You fools!

10:32.038 --> 10:34.139
(sobs)

10:34.173 --> 10:36.374
(yells)

10:41.881 --> 10:42.880
For real.

10:42.915 --> 10:44.248
(upbeat music)

10:48.320 --> 10:50.954
Dude, I got to tell you
something.

10:50.989 --> 10:53.624
- What's up?
- Last night on Showtimes,

10:53.658 --> 10:56.961
I saw some <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>.

10:56.995 --> 11:00.564
<i>Lethal Weapon 2</i> starring
the racist-ass Melly Gibsons?

11:00.599 --> 11:03.735
I know, I know, but I got
to tell you right up front

11:03.769 --> 11:06.037
and truthfully,

11:06.071 --> 11:08.774

is still kind of my [bleep].

11:13.612 --> 11:14.912
He's still my [bleep], dog.

11:14.946 --> 11:17.815
I don't know, dog,
racist-ass Melly Gibsons?

11:17.850 --> 11:19.083
Dude, I know, I know,
but think about it, man.

11:19.118 --> 11:21.285
Think about it.
remember when he jacked up

11:21.320 --> 11:23.221
all them mutants
into <i>Road Warriors</i> ?

11:23.255 --> 11:24.723
Talkin' about...
(imitates tires screeching)

11:24.757 --> 11:26.458
Bitch was like, "There's
nothing in here but sand."

11:26.492 --> 11:28.193
- Yeah.
- And then remember

11:28.227 --> 11:30.662
when he had taken that hatchet
and chopped up

11:30.697 --> 11:33.465
all them Englands, remember,
in <i>The Patriot</i> ?

11:33.499 --> 11:35.434
And did it in front
of all his kids.

11:35.468 --> 11:38.770
You know what,
though?

11:38.804 --> 11:40.905
Racist-ass Melly Gibsons
is still my [bleep] too.

11:40.939 --> 11:42.273
- Dog.
- Remember when racist-ass

11:42.307 --> 11:44.908
Melly Gibsons was Blue Man Group
in <i>Bravehearts</i> ?

11:44.942 --> 11:46.076
- Oh, my God, dogs.
- They was chopping off

11:46.110 --> 11:47.344
my man's head.
(murmurs)

11:47.378 --> 11:48.845
My man was still talking
about...

11:48.880 --> 11:50.480
(both) freedom!

11:50.515 --> 11:51.849
(hisses)

11:51.883 --> 11:53.784
Or what about
<i>Conspiracy Theories</i>, though?

11:53.818 --> 11:55.919
- What? Oh, come on, man.

11:55.954 --> 11:57.521

11:57.555 --> 12:00.491
What the [bleep] about
<i>Conspiracy Theories</i>, though?

12:00.525 --> 12:03.327
- What is going on?

12:03.362 --> 12:04.495
- Come on.

12:04.530 --> 12:06.097

12:09.702 --> 12:11.669
be telling the story
of a bunch of crazy-ass,

12:11.704 --> 12:12.937
old-fashioned Mexicans?

12:12.972 --> 12:13.972
who have been in the jungle

12:14.006 --> 12:15.740
getting chased by a panther.

12:15.774 --> 12:17.108
- Yeah, yeah.
- My man's straight up going...

12:17.142 --> 12:18.776
- (whistling)
- (imitating drums)

12:18.811 --> 12:21.613
- (hissing)
- (screams softly)

12:21.647 --> 12:24.015
Man, and what about that
<i>Passions of the Christ</i>, though?

12:24.050 --> 12:25.116
<i>Passions of the Christ</i>,
though.

12:25.151 --> 12:26.351
<i>Passions of the Christ</i>.

12:26.385 --> 12:27.552
<i>Passions of the Christ</i>
where racist-ass

12:27.586 --> 12:28.720
Melly Gibsons made that movie
about Jesus

12:28.754 --> 12:30.155
in a kind of racist-ass way?

12:30.189 --> 12:31.222
- That was my jam.
- And you know

12:31.257 --> 12:32.524
what I just realized,
though?

12:32.558 --> 12:33.758
What's that, dog?
What's that?

12:33.793 --> 12:34.960
You know what would be
my [bleep]?

12:34.994 --> 12:36.428
What would be your [bleep],
though?

12:36.462 --> 12:38.030
If racist-ass Melly Gibsons

12:38.064 --> 12:40.966
costarred in a movie
with Jesus.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.935
Wait, now you talking
about the savior of all?

12:43.970 --> 12:46.371
The King of all Kings?
The Alpha and the Omega?

12:46.405 --> 12:48.807
And Jesus.

12:48.841 --> 12:51.342
(both) That would be my...

12:51.377 --> 12:56.147
â™ª [bleep]

12:56.181 --> 12:59.385
(rumbling)

12:59.419 --> 13:01.354
(heavenly tone)

13:03.283 --> 13:05.150
(soul music)

13:05.339 --> 13:07.540
For this segment,
we're not gonna have

13:07.574 --> 13:09.408
a big, huge preamble here.

13:09.443 --> 13:13.446
I just simply want
to say that this scene,

13:13.481 --> 13:15.715
this offering if you will,

13:15.749 --> 13:18.417
is for the ladies.

13:18.452 --> 13:21.287
(cheers and applause)

13:21.321 --> 13:23.122
- What up, homies?
- Welcome to...

13:23.157 --> 13:24.724
- (both) Cunnilingus class.

13:24.759 --> 13:26.159
I'm T-Ray Tombstone.

13:26.194 --> 13:27.327
And we're here to teach y'all
how to...

13:27.362 --> 13:28.862
(both)
go down on bitches right.

13:28.896 --> 13:30.363
Now bitches ain't being
satisfied, so check it.

13:30.398 --> 13:32.132
Quit sucking
on that [bleep] so damn hard.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.500
Bitches don't like
that nonsense.

13:33.534 --> 13:34.768
That's like putting the tip

13:34.802 --> 13:36.069
of your penis
in the vacuum.

13:36.104 --> 13:38.272
- Y'all need to...
- (both) chill on the [bleep].

13:38.306 --> 13:40.407
- Go around that business.
- That's like a button

13:40.442 --> 13:41.776
made of a million penis tops.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.444
Now every bitch
like her cunnilingus

13:43.478 --> 13:45.513
- a little bit different.
- Vaginas are like snowflakes.

13:45.547 --> 13:47.815
Snowflakes is different.
Learn your bitch's snowflake.

13:47.849 --> 13:49.249
Ask your bitch
what she wants.

13:49.284 --> 13:50.985
(both) Then do what she says.

13:51.019 --> 13:52.219
Some bitches like it
in circles.

13:52.254 --> 13:53.287
Some bitches
like it up and down.

13:53.321 --> 13:54.655
Some bitches like it hard.

13:54.689 --> 13:55.923
Some bitches like it soft.

13:55.957 --> 13:58.025
(both) Communicate
with your bitches.

13:58.059 --> 13:59.293
Make the alphabet
with your tongue.

13:59.327 --> 14:01.628
A-B-C-D...

14:01.663 --> 14:02.796
And when she grab your hair

14:02.830 --> 14:04.097
like she gonna pull
your damn head off...

14:04.132 --> 14:06.000
(both) stay with that letter.

14:06.034 --> 14:08.803
I'm talking about B...
(blathers)

14:08.837 --> 14:10.670
or D...
(blathers)

14:10.705 --> 14:12.672
(both) Vaginas deserve respect.

14:12.706 --> 14:14.207
You don't want someone
slapping around

14:14.241 --> 14:16.876
your little homey.
(yelping)

14:16.910 --> 14:18.144
- You with the hat.
- Yo.

14:18.178 --> 14:19.512
How you like your BJs?

14:19.547 --> 14:22.181
Damn, dog,
all the time.

14:22.216 --> 14:23.816
Shut the [bleep] up!

14:23.851 --> 14:25.118
That's 'cause penises is easy,

14:25.152 --> 14:26.219
and vaginas is hard.

14:26.253 --> 14:28.821
- They're...
- (both) confusing!

14:28.856 --> 14:31.291
Imagine there's an explosion
at the envelope factory.

14:31.325 --> 14:32.992
Flaps everywhere.
A world of flaps.

14:33.027 --> 14:35.161
And you need to lick your way
out the factory.

14:35.195 --> 14:36.863
But every bitch's flaps
is different.

14:36.897 --> 14:38.564
Learn your bitch's
particular flaps.

14:38.599 --> 14:41.100
- Flaps be...
- (both) crazy!

14:41.134 --> 14:42.735
Every flap
need to be listened to.

14:42.769 --> 14:44.384
And then you will get out
of that factory alive.

14:44.456 --> 14:45.404
Stay down there.

14:45.439 --> 14:48.207
(both) Plan your breathing
like your swimming.

14:48.242 --> 14:50.243
- You gotta be talking about...
- (both) stroke, stroke, breathe.

14:50.277 --> 14:51.678
Stroke, stroke, breathe.

14:51.712 --> 14:53.513
(gasping)

14:53.547 --> 14:54.914
All right.
Let's take a five-minute break.

14:54.949 --> 14:56.215
And when we come back,
we gonna talk

14:56.250 --> 14:57.450
about warming your bitches up
before you get busy.

14:57.484 --> 14:59.218
And how to last
for more than two damn minutes.

14:59.253 --> 15:00.653
Take a peach and practice.

15:00.687 --> 15:01.954
- Practice on a peach.
- Take a peach and practice.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.322
- Practice on a peach.
- Take a peach and practice.

15:03.356 --> 15:05.358
- Practice on a peach.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:14.635 --> 15:17.604
Well, I think
it's gonna work.

15:17.639 --> 15:21.007
30 down,
3 billion to go.

15:21.042 --> 15:24.077
(maniacal laughter)

15:27.519 --> 15:31.321
(upbeat music)

15:31.356 --> 15:32.923
Welcome to <i>Metta World News</i>.

15:32.957 --> 15:35.826
Our top story--
ninja costumes don't come

15:35.861 --> 15:38.429
in size triple-X,
which is discriminatory

15:38.463 --> 15:41.231
against enormous assassins.

15:41.266 --> 15:45.168
Do you know what?
Forget about the teleprompter.

15:45.203 --> 15:47.670
I need to speak
from the heart.

15:47.705 --> 15:49.439
Well, that wraps up
<i>Metta World News</i>

15:49.473 --> 15:51.541
for this Wednesday,
May Staple Gun Hairbrush.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.577
I'm Metta World Peace.
Good night.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.568
I made this mistake
in the past.

16:01.602 --> 16:06.673
If there's any question whether
a woman's pregnant or not,

16:06.707 --> 16:08.742
just don't say [bleep]
about it.

16:08.776 --> 16:10.644
This is what happened to me.
Just be the woman.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.212
(hums)
Hey, Jordan.

16:12.246 --> 16:14.147
I said,
"Oh, congratulations."

16:14.181 --> 16:15.949
Congratulations for what?

16:15.983 --> 16:18.351
(laughs)

16:18.385 --> 16:20.687
(laughter)

16:20.721 --> 16:23.724
Hoo-hoo.

16:23.758 --> 16:25.192
And now I'm at the point where,
I don't care

16:25.227 --> 16:26.393
how many signals I get,

16:26.428 --> 16:28.996
I just won't even say anything.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.697
(breathing heavily)

16:30.732 --> 16:33.634
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm with you.

16:33.668 --> 16:35.202
(laughter)

16:35.237 --> 16:38.372
- It's contractions now.
- Yeah, I got some gas myself.

16:38.406 --> 16:40.707
(laughter)

16:40.742 --> 16:43.844
- Oh, God.
- I'm gonna sit down with you.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.913
- Oh!
- I'm gonna sit down with you.

16:45.947 --> 16:49.083
- (yelling)
- Me and you are--

16:49.117 --> 16:50.251
- Oh, that is...
- (imitating baby crying)

16:50.286 --> 16:52.721
Looks like,
but I can't be sure...

16:52.756 --> 16:54.590
I can't be sure.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.925
Mwah.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.627
Okay, that's clearly a child.

16:57.661 --> 16:59.028
Congratulations
on your pregnancy.

16:59.062 --> 17:01.230
- I'm not pregnant. What the--
- What the--

17:01.265 --> 17:03.066
(laughter)

17:03.100 --> 17:04.901
(cheers and applause)

17:04.935 --> 17:05.935
Thank you, sir.

17:05.969 --> 17:08.137
All right.

17:08.172 --> 17:11.407
All right, how's everybody--
How's everybody doing?

17:11.442 --> 17:12.409
(cheers)

17:12.443 --> 17:13.609
All right,
and you guys

17:13.644 --> 17:15.344
- can all hear me okay?
- (all) Yeah.

17:15.378 --> 17:16.746
I know this guy
can right here.

17:16.780 --> 17:18.347
Boy, this guy's ears
are so big,

17:18.381 --> 17:19.848
He's laughing at jokes
from the Yuk-Yuk Club

17:19.883 --> 17:21.150
all the way
on the other side of town.

17:21.184 --> 17:22.585
(laughter)

17:22.618 --> 17:23.853
All right.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.588
And you, sir,
you're doing okay?

17:25.622 --> 17:27.424
And you're getting enough
to eat?

17:27.458 --> 17:28.725
Is that even possible?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.327
(laughter)

17:30.362 --> 17:31.562
Thank you, sir.

17:31.596 --> 17:32.630
Folks, I'm sorry,

17:32.664 --> 17:33.797
I'm gonna get everybody tonight.

17:33.832 --> 17:36.133
Nobody is safe.
I'm getting everybody.

17:36.167 --> 17:37.934
Except for you, sir.
I'm gonna leave you alone.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.771
Just like your date did tonight.
Hello!

17:40.805 --> 17:42.072
Huh?
All right.

17:42.107 --> 17:43.674
Okay, who's next?

17:43.708 --> 17:47.144
Who is next?

17:51.215 --> 17:56.554
Hey, ma'am, I get it,
you have breasts, okay?

17:56.588 --> 17:57.688
Jeez, I mean,
look at this chick over here.

17:57.723 --> 17:59.123
Her cleavage is giving
the Grand Canyon

17:59.158 --> 18:00.992
an inferiority complex.

18:01.027 --> 18:03.895
(laughter)

18:03.929 --> 18:06.898
(computerized voice)
You skipped me.

18:06.932 --> 18:08.499
Who's talking right now?

18:08.533 --> 18:10.567
Do me.

18:10.602 --> 18:12.736
Yeah, hey, man.

18:12.771 --> 18:15.206
Look at that pink shirt
you got on there.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.877
Wow, where'd you get that?
Queertshirts.com?

18:19.912 --> 18:24.215
It's in support
Of breast cancer awareness.

18:24.249 --> 18:26.750
I am gay, though.

18:26.785 --> 18:27.818
Okay.

18:27.852 --> 18:28.919
Go for it.

18:28.954 --> 18:31.288
I can take it.

18:31.322 --> 18:34.190
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:34.225 --> 18:36.926
No, hey, yeah, don't you worry
about that, man.

18:36.961 --> 18:38.328
Gloves are coming off.

18:38.362 --> 18:41.365
Okay.

18:41.399 --> 18:44.802
Right there, right there, what's
with the three drinks, man?

18:44.836 --> 18:46.971
Alcoholic much?

18:47.005 --> 18:49.507
This
is my pain medication.

18:49.541 --> 18:51.909
Of [bleep] course it is.

18:51.943 --> 18:53.777
It's your pain medication.

18:53.812 --> 18:58.350
'cause he is in pain.

18:58.384 --> 19:00.085
Right now.

19:00.119 --> 19:04.623
Make fun of the burns.

19:04.657 --> 19:06.558
Make fun of the--
What did you say?

19:06.593 --> 19:10.496
Because here's the problem, sir,
is it's really dark in here,

19:10.530 --> 19:12.464
and, sorry, are you burned?
Because I can't make it out.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.266
Thanks so much, ma'am,
for illuminating him.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.569
Thank you.
That's--I appreciate that.

19:17.604 --> 19:21.874
- Oh, those burns.
- Make fun of the robot voice.

19:21.908 --> 19:23.943
Sir, I don't know.

19:23.977 --> 19:25.445
Come on,
I can take it.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.481
Okay, well, no,
You know what?

19:27.515 --> 19:28.949
- I feel--
- Or the wheelchair.

19:28.983 --> 19:31.818
Look, sir,
there is nothing funny

19:31.852 --> 19:33.553
about you being
in a wheelchair,

19:33.587 --> 19:35.755
- and we can all--
- Oh, but there is something

19:35.789 --> 19:38.357
funny about me being fat?

19:38.391 --> 19:39.825
- All right.
All right, fine.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.093
Fine. I've got it.
I've got it.

19:41.128 --> 19:42.561
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

19:42.596 --> 19:43.963
I just didn't want to go
after this guy

19:43.997 --> 19:48.501
'cause I didn't want him
to kill me in my dreams.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.203
Like Freddy Krueger.

19:50.237 --> 19:51.504
(exclamations)

19:51.539 --> 19:52.806
Come on.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.507
'cause--no?

19:54.542 --> 19:58.544
You know, 'cause how Freddy
Krueger's face is burned off.

19:58.579 --> 20:00.981
That's not...

20:01.015 --> 20:04.017
(sobs)

20:10.458 --> 20:15.061
- You ass[bleep].
- He said he could take it.

20:15.095 --> 20:16.129
That's what he said.

20:16.163 --> 20:18.598
I thought I could,
but I can't.

20:18.632 --> 20:20.100
How is this on me?

20:20.134 --> 20:22.268
How do we even know
if he's crying right now?

20:22.303 --> 20:25.237
(all booing)

20:25.272 --> 20:27.106
I don't know that sound.

20:27.140 --> 20:29.574
It just sounds
like an electronic sound.

20:29.609 --> 20:33.345
The tears,
they burn.

20:33.379 --> 20:37.482
He said he could take it.
He s--

20:37.516 --> 20:39.917
(cheers and applause)

20:41.420 --> 20:44.222
Fellows, gentlemen,
it's time for you to go home

20:44.257 --> 20:45.357
and practice on a peach.

20:45.391 --> 20:46.558
Take a peach and practice.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.260
(both) Take a peach
and practice.

20:48.294 --> 20:49.895
- There you go.
- There's a peach for you.

20:49.929 --> 20:51.229
- Take a peach and practice.
- Peach.

20:51.264 --> 20:54.599
- Peach.
- Got one? Got one?

20:54.633 --> 20:57.410
<i>â™ª I'm gonna do
my one line here â™ª</i>

20:57.492 --> 20:59.459
Oh, yeah.
