WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:04.103
(musical theme)

00:44.778 --> 00:47.746
There was a time in China
when smoking opium

00:47.748 --> 00:49.581
was a sign of wealth.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.784
Wealth in that it was
illegal and only the affluent

00:51.786 --> 00:55.487
could escape prosecution,
but also because...

00:55.489 --> 00:57.656
wealth allowed
for a certain leisure

00:57.658 --> 01:01.026
that the smoking
of opium desires.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.728
And it was these
prosperous patrons

01:02.730 --> 01:05.697
who understood opium's
value to artists,

01:05.699 --> 01:08.967
philosophers, and
allowing this golden age

01:08.969 --> 01:12.371
of Chi--
Only a little.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.440
(coughing)

01:19.079 --> 01:21.080
Apologies, Emperor.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.415
Enough history.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.118
We are here
to enjoy the present.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.054
So, let us
retire to the den

01:29.056 --> 01:31.824
and let's imagine
those noblemen

01:31.826 --> 01:35.727
and women of China, resplendent
in their robes of silk,

01:35.729 --> 01:39.798
let us partake
in their same customs.

01:50.643 --> 01:55.013
My highest quality <i>chandu</i> .
Six drops should suffice.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.417
Yes, mm-hm!
Good, now,

01:58.419 --> 02:00.586
place the wok
over the flame.

02:02.255 --> 02:06.291
Use the needle to stir.
It will become gummy.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.393
Like this, Emperor?
Yes, precisely. Now...

02:08.395 --> 02:11.997
roll the opium gum
into a pill.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.237
Place the pill on the
end of the needle...

02:18.239 --> 02:20.973
and carefully thread it
through the hole

02:20.975 --> 02:24.076
at the bottom
of the bowl. Uh-huh...

02:24.078 --> 02:27.779
You are a
natural, my boy.

02:29.549 --> 02:33.385
Now, I need hardly
tell you what to do next.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.954
Ling! Ah,
there you are.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.524
Are we prepared?

03:08.388 --> 03:11.056
This is
excellent, Emperor.

03:11.058 --> 03:14.259
So strong.

03:14.261 --> 03:18.297
My body feels it in every inch.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.417
Sir. Byron Sutton,
23 years of age.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.419
A student
at the university.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.422
Survived only
by his father, I'm told.

03:43.424 --> 03:47.292
Any witnesses to the incident?
All of them, sir.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.761
I've only begun speaking
with them but, apparently,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.763
they indulge in this fashion
once a week, this week

03:51.765 --> 03:55.400
being no exception. None of them
reports seeing anything unusual.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.936
And who owns this home?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.771
Professor Aldous
Lawrence, sir,

03:59.773 --> 04:02.207
the man in the smoking jacket.
These are all his students

04:02.209 --> 04:04.409
at the University.
He teaches Oriental Studies,

04:04.411 --> 04:07.279
although this particular
group is not affiliated

04:07.281 --> 04:09.014
with the school.
This is The...

04:09.016 --> 04:11.717
Earthen Dragon Society.

04:11.719 --> 04:15.053
And its purpose?
To further appreciate

04:15.055 --> 04:17.356
the mysteries
of China, apparently.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.158
In other words,
to smoke opium.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.099
Come, my dear.
Sir, the Earthen Dragon

04:27.101 --> 04:29.901
Society has 4 students:
the unfortunate

04:29.903 --> 04:33.805
deceased Byron Sutton,
Mr. Gregory Cummings,

04:33.807 --> 04:38.076
Susan Trent and this is
her brother, Matthew Trent.

04:38.078 --> 04:41.113
May we leave, please?

04:41.115 --> 04:43.749
My sister is unwell.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.085
Mr. Trent, what can you tell
me about this evening's events?

04:47.087 --> 04:51.056
Nothing, really.
Nothing of importance.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.293
Everyone smoked opium, Byron
thought it was just marvelous.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.229
Did he say anything?

04:57.231 --> 04:59.498
He mentioned something
about it being strong,

04:59.500 --> 05:02.167
that he could feel it all over
his body or some such nonsense.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.737
So, Mr. Trent your experience
was not the same?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.773
I really should
get her home.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.242
I should like
to speak with her first.

05:10.244 --> 05:13.745
She's really quite distressed.
Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?

05:13.747 --> 05:16.214
Sir, she is in a state. I
tried to speak with her earlier;

05:16.216 --> 05:18.917
it was a fruitless conversation.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.155
Tomorrow, then.
Yes, thank you.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.592
If they can leave,
I imagine so can I.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.928
Gregory Cummings, sir.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.130
Did you notice anything
unusual this evening,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.132
Mr. Cummings?
No, not at all.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.202
Other than Byron was given
his own vial of opium and taught

05:37.204 --> 05:39.805
to roll his own pill.
This was unusual?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.274
The pipes are always
prepared by Mrs. Lawrence.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.910
And rolling is a sacred art form
that none of us are permitted

05:44.912 --> 05:48.880
to attempt. The Emperor saw fit
to allow Byron, for some reason.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.384
The Emperor?
What we call Prof. Lawrence.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.886
I see.

05:54.888 --> 05:59.391
So, no one else smoked the same
opium that Mr. Sutton did.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.393
No. The rest of the pipes
were prepared in the kitchen,

06:01.395 --> 06:04.162
as usual, by Mrs. Lawrence.
Right.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.766
Sir, where is your wife?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.401
I put her
to bed. Detective,

06:09.403 --> 06:12.170
I'm happy to speak with you
further, perhaps it could wait

06:12.172 --> 06:13.939
until tomorrow.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.842
Uh, you are referred to
as the Emperor..?

06:19.512 --> 06:22.714
Yes, I had the hubris
to decorate my den

06:22.716 --> 06:26.251
with a five-clawed dragon.
In Ancient China,

06:26.253 --> 06:28.887
such a dragon was
reserved for royalty.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.922
Anyone else with one
would be put to death.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.860
Even my students wouldn't dare
to possess a five-clawed dragon.

06:34.862 --> 06:38.096
I see. I'll need you
to provide me

06:38.098 --> 06:40.565
with the vial of opium
from which Mr. Sutton

06:40.567 --> 06:42.868
prepared his pipe.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.971
I couldn't tell you
what killed him.

06:45.973 --> 06:49.408
Constriction in his pupils
suggests he had opiates

06:49.410 --> 06:53.478
in his blood, but beyond that,
I see no outward indicators.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.281
Sir, the opium.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.483
Apparently it all comes
from the same batch,

06:58.485 --> 07:00.986
but it was from
this exact container

07:00.988 --> 07:04.022
that Mr. Sutton
filled this exact pipe.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.692
Thank you, George. Check
the pipe for fingermarks.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.061
And I'll take
the opium.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.330
Gentlemen, if
you'll excuse me.

07:12.332 --> 07:16.268
So, what do you think sir?
Death by misadventure?

07:16.270 --> 07:19.571
Then why is he
the only one?

07:21.374 --> 07:23.175
What does Dr. Ogden
have to say?

07:23.177 --> 07:25.377
She is still conducting the
post mortem. But, I expect

07:25.379 --> 07:27.712
it will be a case
of excessive intake.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.948
It takes some real effort

07:29.950 --> 07:32.017
to die smoking
opium, Murdoch.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.386
It's more the stopping it
that will kill ya.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.255
I knew plenty of opium fiends
during my time in Afghanistan,

07:37.257 --> 07:40.759
and this little China club seems
more like play-acting to me.

07:42.528 --> 07:46.631
Must be
Mr. Sutton's father.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.267
My greatest fear
has been realized.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.072
I knew that Professor Lawrence
would lead to my boy's ruin.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.142
The man is a charlatan,

07:57.144 --> 08:00.178
a Svengali, using opium
to draw a veil of control

08:00.180 --> 08:03.048
over the impressionable young.
You believe

08:03.050 --> 08:05.817
that Lawrence was attempting
to control your son somehow.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.320
Yes. But the more
I protested,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.255
the stronger his hold
over Byron became.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.191
And with Byron's constitution
as frail as it was...

08:13.193 --> 08:16.061
Your son was ill?
He suffered from bouts

08:16.063 --> 08:18.263
of pleurisy, and...

08:18.265 --> 08:20.565
he was always
a fragile boy.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.336
He was supposed
to become a doctor and...

08:24.338 --> 08:27.105
follow in my footsteps.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.913
Dr. Sutton, perhaps you wish
to continue another time?

08:34.915 --> 08:37.516
I wish only
to see that professor

08:37.518 --> 08:40.352
punished for his crimes.
Crimes?

08:40.354 --> 08:42.854
Not only was he turning Byron
against Occidental medicine,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.457
but that foreign wife
of his was feeding Byron

08:45.459 --> 08:47.526
all manner of
poisonous concoctions.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.261
You believe
your son was poisoned.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.796
Those Asiatic types show no
restraint in what they will turn

08:51.798 --> 08:54.132
into miracle cures.
Parts of animals

08:54.134 --> 08:56.067
not even the basest
tribes of Africa would eat.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.437
Herbs so toxic even touching
their leaves would kill you.

08:59.439 --> 09:03.341
Your son's cause of death
is as yet undetermined.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.477
Knowing that professor,

09:05.479 --> 09:07.479
that's what killed him.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.848
Mark my words.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.184
Mr. Sutton died
of respiratory arrest,

09:13.186 --> 09:16.087
not a result
of smoking opium. In fact,

09:16.089 --> 09:18.323
there was very little
residue in his lung tissue,

09:18.325 --> 09:20.825
suggesting he
smoked infrequently.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.827
Mr. Sutton's father

09:22.829 --> 09:25.730
said he had pleurisy.
Could that have been a factor?

09:25.732 --> 09:28.500
Miss James?
Pleurisy is an inflammation

09:28.502 --> 09:30.835
of the muscle tissue
surrounding the lungs.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.838
It's painful, but not fatal.
Very good. I am surprised

09:33.840 --> 09:36.174
he didn't smoke more,
opium may have eased his pain.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.210
It apparently wasn't smoked
for pain relief, but rather

09:39.212 --> 09:41.546
as a philosophical exercise.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.516
Indeed? It's
an intriguing concept.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.018
The opium Mr. Sutton
smoked was unadulterated,

09:47.020 --> 09:50.956
but... we did find traces
of herbs in his stomach.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.592
We have yet to analyse them
but I suspect the herbs may

09:53.594 --> 09:56.061
have contributed to
his respiratory arrest.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.798
You believe he was poisoned.
It's my best guess.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.603
My herbs killed Byron?
No! Impossible!

10:04.605 --> 10:06.905
We'll need to sample
the concoction.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.475
Of course. It's
a simple assembly

10:10.477 --> 10:12.577
to help his lungs.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.579
Byron was in pain;

10:14.581 --> 10:16.748
my husband
worried for him.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.619
Byron was all
he cared about.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.921
Perhaps you might
divulge the ingredients?

10:22.923 --> 10:27.058
Well, I may not know all
the English names correct,

10:27.060 --> 10:30.962
but it includes <i>ma huang;</i>
<i>you call it sea grape,</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:34.399
aconite, peppermint
and ginseng.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.901
Aconite.
As in, wolfsbane?

10:36.903 --> 10:39.904
That's a very dangerous
and very toxic plant.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.741
Yes! the plant,
yes, very dangerous.

10:42.743 --> 10:47.112
Not my preparation
of it. I am trained.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.248
I make the powder
myself with great care.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.917
It is safe
in small quantities.

10:52.919 --> 10:56.187
That's really not necessary.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.823
I am perfectly fine.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.193
I am certain my herbs
are not at fault.

11:04.030 --> 11:07.532
She gave him wolfsbane?
That she herself prepared?

11:07.534 --> 11:10.869
The woman is very brave.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.104
Or very well trained
in her craft.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.107
Wolfsbane would fit...
given that Mr. Sutton

11:16.109 --> 11:19.477
died of respiratory arrest.
As would a number of poisons.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.279
What are the symptoms
of wolfsbane?

11:21.281 --> 11:25.250
Pins and needles, muscle
paralysis, and seizures.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.786
By all accounts Mr. Sutton
did not experience seizures.

11:27.788 --> 11:31.723
Or any other kinds of distress.
So not wolfsbane?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.626
That would have been too easy.
There are a great number

11:34.628 --> 11:37.996
of poisons to consider. We need
to narrow our field of search.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.899
How would you
propose we begin?

11:40.901 --> 11:44.002
What if we could discern
the method of delivery?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.071
It may at least
help us determine

11:46.073 --> 11:48.073
whether the poison
was slow or fact acting.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.909
Good. If the poison
was cumulative,

11:50.911 --> 11:53.278
we would have seen damage
to the organs and tissues,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.780
which we did not.
May we assume that the poison

11:55.782 --> 11:57.782
was administered
within a day of his death?

11:57.784 --> 12:00.018
Mm-hm!
Alright then. I believe

12:00.020 --> 12:02.353
I've been able to ascertain
all of Mr. Sutton's movements

12:02.355 --> 12:04.889
in the 24 hours
prior to his death.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.860
Starting the evening prior,
he ate at home with his father;

12:08.862 --> 12:11.863
roast beef. I've been
able to procure some remnants.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.866
I apologize for the smell;
it's already been disposed of.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.535
We are rather accustomed to
the aroma of decay, Constable.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.972
Yes, of course you are.
Mr. Sutton then slept fitfully,

12:20.974 --> 12:22.807
he had several coughing
fits through the night

12:22.809 --> 12:26.144
which woke his father. In the
morning, he declined breakfast,

12:26.146 --> 12:28.780
having only tea. I don't
have a sample, but I did find

12:28.782 --> 12:31.549
the teapot.
That should do!

12:31.551 --> 12:34.052
He then attended classes

12:34.054 --> 12:37.155
and lunched with Professor
Lawrence in the faculty lounge.

12:37.157 --> 12:41.726
He then continued on to
Professor Lawrence's home,

12:41.728 --> 12:44.496
and dined with
the other students...

12:44.498 --> 12:47.098
and they continued

12:47.100 --> 12:50.101
to smoke opium...

12:50.103 --> 12:52.170
from this pipe.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.809
Thank you George, that
was rather comprehensive.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.713
It truly is
a work of art.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.882
Doctor, if I may, besides
the roast beef he had

13:03.884 --> 13:06.351
with his father, which was
well before he died, Mr. Sutton

13:06.353 --> 13:09.020
only ate in large groups.
I would be very surprised

13:09.022 --> 13:10.955
if you find food
to be the culprit.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.258
Yet, there are no injection
marks on the body. So if it was

13:13.260 --> 13:16.394
poison, it had to be ingested.
Dr. Ogden,

13:16.396 --> 13:19.597
what if the poison was
ingested through what he smoked?

13:19.599 --> 13:22.200
But you yourself
tested the opium, Rebecca.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.237
You found no impurities.
Not in the opium, no.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.540
But what about this?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.308
It was the pipe,
William. More specifically,

13:30.310 --> 13:33.545
the bowl attached to the pipe.
The opium is placed inside

13:33.547 --> 13:36.247
the bowl, which is attached
to the pipe by an airtight seal.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.384
The bowl is held over a flame
and when the smoker inhales,

13:39.386 --> 13:43.121
the opium is vapourized.
I suspect the bowl was treated

13:43.123 --> 13:46.591
with the poison which then
vapourized along with the opium.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.460
How did you come
to that conclusion?

13:49.462 --> 13:52.096
Airtight container through
which we recreated the process

13:52.098 --> 13:54.766
of smoking the pipe.
And the noble sacrifice

13:54.768 --> 13:57.769
of a rat.
Miss James has yet to harden

13:57.771 --> 14:00.405
herself to the
realities of lab work.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.574
It's rather ingenious.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.742
And it would also
explain why Mr. Sutton

14:04.744 --> 14:07.045
was the only one affected.
We have yet to isolate

14:07.047 --> 14:09.747
the poison itself,
but my official report

14:09.749 --> 14:12.050
will state that Byron Sutton
was the unfortunate

14:12.052 --> 14:15.220
victim of homicide.
So, the question becomes:

14:15.222 --> 14:17.922
Who wanted
Mr. Sutton dead?

14:23.896 --> 14:26.030
Murdered?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.866
What are you
talking about?

14:27.868 --> 14:30.969
We now know that the pipe
that Mr. Sutton smoked

14:30.971 --> 14:34.072
had been poisoned.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.276
His pipe? Now,
it was brand new!

14:38.278 --> 14:41.145
It had never been
smoked before last night.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.282
Byron bought
the pipe, the bowl;

14:44.284 --> 14:47.218
the entire layout was
custom made in China.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.287
It arrived
a few days ago

14:49.289 --> 14:51.389
and Byron brought it
directly here.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.425
Who had access
to the pipe?

14:54.427 --> 14:58.129
I did, of course.
My wife.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.199
Byron, naturally.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.501
Susan was here
with her brother Matthew.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.671
Gregory is here
almost every day.

15:06.673 --> 15:11.075
I can't provide
deniability for anyone.

15:11.077 --> 15:14.379
Even myself.
Is your wife home?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.180
No. Why?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.616
I understand she has
a knowledge of poisons.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.386
As did the rest! Ling
gave them a lecture

15:21.388 --> 15:25.056
on poisons used in Chinese
medicine only two weeks ago.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.458
Was everyone in attendance?
Yes.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.362
In fact, I recall Gregory asking
a great number of questions.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.033
Gregory Cummings.
He and Byron were both

15:35.035 --> 15:37.368
interested in studying
Chinese medicine.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.071
Though Gregory was
by far the better student.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.041
I suppose it was
only natural

15:43.043 --> 15:45.944
for him to be
surprised when I awarded

15:45.946 --> 15:48.546
the scholarship to Byron.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.981
What scholarship?

15:49.983 --> 15:52.717
Wherein a bright student
accompanies me to further

15:52.719 --> 15:55.219
his studies in China.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.221
If Mr. Cummings
is the better student,

15:57.223 --> 15:59.557
then, why award the
scholarship to Mr. Sutton?

15:59.559 --> 16:02.660
Byron and my wife
were friendly...

16:02.662 --> 16:05.863
and she and Gregory
were the opposite.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.865
And it's
important that we...

16:07.867 --> 16:10.335
all get along
for such a long journey.

16:10.337 --> 16:13.871
I take it Mr. Cummings was
unhappy with your decision?

16:13.873 --> 16:16.140
Very.

16:20.212 --> 16:23.281
Mr. Cummings!
A moment of your time.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.350
Detective Murdoch.
I'm on my way to class.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.686
You seem to be coping with
the passing of a fellow student

16:28.688 --> 16:30.888
quite admirably.
We weren't friends,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.523
Detective, if that's
what you're asking.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.592
Yes, I understand you were
quite upset at losing out

16:34.594 --> 16:37.362
on Professor
Lawrence's scholarship.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.131
Byron was always
the golden student.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.300
A bit of a dolt, really,

16:42.302 --> 16:44.302
but somehow managed
to dazzle everyone,

16:44.304 --> 16:48.039
playing the noble invalid.
I admit to some jealousy.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.441
But nothing compared to Susan's.
Susan Trent?

16:50.443 --> 16:54.045
Yes, she and Byron were
sweethearts for quite some time.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.381
She thought he was going
to propose when he ended

16:56.383 --> 16:59.984
their courtship. She even went
so far as to curse him dead.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.652
When was this?

17:01.654 --> 17:04.022
During one of Mrs. Lawrence's
lectures on poisons.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.558
Rather <i>à propos,</i>
<i>wouldn't you say?</i>

17:08.994 --> 17:11.195
Yes, Detective...

17:11.197 --> 17:14.165
he broke my heart.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.101
I've no doubt you heard
that from vile Gregory.

17:17.103 --> 17:20.238
But I follow the tao,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.207
the way. Violence
is not in my nature

17:23.209 --> 17:25.843
nor on my path
to enlightenment.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.212
You smoke opium, Miss Trent?

17:28.214 --> 17:32.050
Hm, <i>la fée brune</i>
<i>is a true delight.</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:34.619
A way of seeing
the universe clearly.

17:34.621 --> 17:39.390
Life is dull. Life
on opium is dazzling.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.360
So, you understand the
workings of an opium pipe

17:42.362 --> 17:45.029
and would be able
to poison one.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.899
Is that how Byron died?

17:47.901 --> 17:51.102
From his pipe?

17:51.104 --> 17:54.605
How wonderful! I should
like to die from a breath

17:54.607 --> 17:57.308
of the brown fairy.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.044
I hear from Byron,
now and again.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.981
Do you?
He sent me a message.

18:03.983 --> 18:07.151
"We will meet again
when the time is right."

18:07.153 --> 18:10.221
Oh, bother!

18:12.424 --> 18:15.226
Sir!

18:15.228 --> 18:18.096
Mr. Trent. The detective
is occupied right now.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.198
That, Constable, is my sister.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
And this, Mr. Trent,
is a police station.

18:22.202 --> 18:25.169
Now, you are welcome to wait.
Mr. Trent.

18:25.171 --> 18:28.840
Your sister has asked for
a moment to gather her strength.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.209
More like her courage.
She knows I'm about to give her

18:31.211 --> 18:33.411
what for. Staying out all hours,

18:33.413 --> 18:35.847
quoting that ridiculous
Professor Lawrence as gospel.

18:35.849 --> 18:39.584
But you are a disciple of
Prof. Lawrence's, are you not?

18:39.586 --> 18:43.454
I only joined that group
to keep an eye on Susan.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.457
She's changed so much since she
started going with Byron Sutton.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.527
He dragged her to
The Emperor's club.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.529
I was certain there was going
to be more than just Chinese

18:51.531 --> 18:54.565
philosophy. And I was right.
You mean the opium.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.868
We are from
a respectable family.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.570
It's one thing for the Chinese
to engage in such a vice;

18:59.572 --> 19:02.006
quite another for our people.
What do you know

19:02.008 --> 19:04.008
about opium pipes?
Nothing.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.244
I've never smoked
the infernal stuff.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.313
You were there, in
Prof. Lawrence's opium den.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.849
I don't inhale. I would
never lower myself

19:11.851 --> 19:14.986
to that level of iniquity.
That damned Byron Sutton!

19:14.988 --> 19:18.189
This is all
his own fault.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.825
Matthew.
Come now, Susan.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.027
We should
get you home.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.062
That appears

19:25.064 --> 19:26.931
to be as much as I can salvage.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.567
Then we'll have to be very
selective with the poisons

19:29.569 --> 19:32.370
we choose to test.
All of these poisons

19:32.372 --> 19:35.072
result in respiratory
arrest. But we know

19:35.074 --> 19:38.209
the culprit is not
an inorganic poison

19:38.211 --> 19:40.678
because that would have
resulted in evidence

19:40.680 --> 19:42.847
in the body.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.082
The general test
for alkaloids was positive.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.585
Opium is an alkaloid,

19:47.587 --> 19:50.221
which could explain that
result. But given the lack

19:50.223 --> 19:52.590
of other symptoms in
the body, we can assume

19:52.592 --> 19:55.393
the poison is
an alkaloid as well.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.728
So we are
looking for a plant?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.530
At least
to start, yes.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.633
Mr. Sutton died between
the time he lit that pipe

20:02.635 --> 20:05.203
and when he was discovered
one hour later, dead.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.471
Then it is extremely
fast-acting.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.107
Hm... He also
didn't seize,

20:10.109 --> 20:12.577
so we can eliminate strychnine.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.912
Hemlock is still an option.
Belladonna?

20:14.914 --> 20:18.115
His pupils were constricted
rather than dilated.

20:18.117 --> 20:21.052
But... don't opiates constrict
pupils?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.887
Yes. It is possible

20:22.889 --> 20:24.755
that one could mask the other.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.724
Let's leave it on the list.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.659
(bubbling sounds)

20:28.661 --> 20:30.695
♪

21:06.265 --> 21:09.400
Not cyanide, either.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.203
All in a day's
work, Miss James.

21:12.205 --> 21:14.372
Pathology
requires patience.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.707
We are out of plants that
cause respiratory paralysis

21:16.709 --> 21:20.044
and... our poisoned opium
residue is almost gone.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.381
Perhaps our
alkaloid positive

21:23.383 --> 21:25.750
was a result of
the opium after all.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.953
We haven't considered
poisons from an animal source.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.789
Don't they use animals in
Chinese medicine all the time?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.625
They do. And I know
little of their toxicity.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.462
Perhaps an afternoon
excursion is in order.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.898
(oriental music)

21:40.900 --> 21:44.068
Yes, I sell many animal parts,

21:44.070 --> 21:46.337
but... not to kill!

21:46.339 --> 21:48.673
I know it's not your
intention to kill anyone.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.976
But you must know of a
substance that could be fatal.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.513
Yes, many plants, puffer fish.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.315
Puffer fish?

21:57.317 --> 22:00.451
The flesh is only safe
if removed properly.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.521
What if it isn't
removed properly?

22:03.523 --> 22:06.390
Then you stop breathing...
almost right away.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.694
Puffer fish. That
could be our poison.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.530
Gregory Cummings was
angry at Byron Sutton

22:12.532 --> 22:14.532
for winning the
China trip over him.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.201
Angry enough to kill over?
Sir, you haven't met

22:17.203 --> 22:20.371
Mr. Cummings.
Susan Trent was heartbroken.

22:20.373 --> 22:23.441
Her brother, Matthew Trent,
blamed the victim

22:23.443 --> 22:26.210
for ruining his sister.
Also a motive.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.245
What about the Chinese wife?

22:28.247 --> 22:30.448
Ling Lawrence had
a knowledge of poisons,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.484
certainly had opportunity
and she seemed...

22:33.486 --> 22:37.822
unhappy her husband was showing
affection toward the deceased.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.924
So everyone with the
opportunity to poison

22:39.926 --> 22:41.792
Sutton's pipe also had a motive.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.795
With one notable exception.

22:44.797 --> 22:48.132
Professor Lawrence.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.768
Well, that eliminates
one suspect.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.137
George, were you able
to extract fingermarks

22:53.139 --> 22:55.639
from the pipe itself?
Sir, several, in fact.

22:55.641 --> 22:58.409
Right, then. We'll need
to obtain fingermarks from all

22:58.411 --> 23:00.344
of the suspects. Perhaps
we can place the pipe

23:00.346 --> 23:04.281
in someone else's hands.
Sir.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.585
Inspector. Detective.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.187
Dr. Sutton. How
may we help you?

23:10.189 --> 23:12.356
Am I to conclude...

23:12.358 --> 23:15.393
the professor is not
a suspect in your investigation?

23:15.395 --> 23:19.130
We are pursuing
all avenues at the moment.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.098
There is only
one avenue:

23:21.100 --> 23:24.201
Professor Lawrence
murdered my boy. I know it.

23:24.203 --> 23:27.538
I'm afraid your certainty
isn't quite enough, Dr. Sutton.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.608
This letter arrived
for Byron today.

23:30.610 --> 23:34.278
I thought you might
want to see it.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.118
It's written in Chinese.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.734
Sir,

23:56.736 --> 23:59.637
I have a translation.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.372
"My dear Golden Dragon.

24:01.374 --> 24:04.341
"I fear for your safety.
The Earth Dragon

24:04.343 --> 24:07.678
"asks your Water Goat questions.
I cannot answer truthfully

24:07.680 --> 24:10.514
"or our love will be
exposed. Soon we will meet

24:10.516 --> 24:14.118
"by the poppy field and spend
all our days in sweet embrace

24:14.120 --> 24:16.353
among the fragrant blossoms."
And the rest, sir,

24:16.355 --> 24:18.956
is of a rather intimate nature.
That will suffice, George,

24:18.958 --> 24:21.192
thank you.
Well then,

24:21.194 --> 24:23.527
we can assume that the
Golden Dragon is Byron Sutton,

24:23.529 --> 24:25.463
given the letter
was addressed to him.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.232
Sir, Mr. Sutton
IS a Golden Dragon.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.568
That's his Chinese
astrological sign.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.570
How did you come
to that conclusion?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.738
The translator told me,
sir. I then took all the other

24:34.740 --> 24:37.041
astrological signs and checked
them against the birth years

24:37.043 --> 24:39.376
of our suspects.
Are you are able to identify

24:39.378 --> 24:41.946
others mentioned in the letter.
I was, sir.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.715
The Earth Dragon
is Professor Lawrence.

24:44.717 --> 24:48.085
And the letter writer,
the... Water Goat?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.454
We have two water goats,
sir. One is Susan Trent...

24:50.456 --> 24:53.591
And the other?
Ling Lawrence.

24:53.593 --> 24:57.161
<i>Yes.</i>

24:57.163 --> 25:00.197
This is my letter.
You were having

25:00.199 --> 25:02.666
an illicit affair
with Byron Sutton.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.106
Byron and I were in love...

25:09.108 --> 25:11.242
for many months.

25:11.244 --> 25:14.712
I persuaded my husband
to give Byron the scholarship.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.214
So you could escape
with him to China.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.583
It was all planned.

25:19.585 --> 25:22.520
We would leave
Aldous in Shanghai

25:22.522 --> 25:24.421
and buy some land
up the Yangtze.

25:24.423 --> 25:27.458
But your husband found out.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.694
It must be so.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.065
My husband killed Byron.

25:35.067 --> 25:39.136
He is dead because of me.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.885
My wife carrying on
with my favourite student.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.789
I feel like
such a fool.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.659
You had no inkling that there
was something between them?

26:01.661 --> 26:04.395
Only friendship.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.565
She never wrote
such intimacies to me.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.204
George?
Sir,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.507
I can't find anything
connecting him to the crime,

26:16.509 --> 26:18.909
but I've yet to check
this locked cabinet.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.346
Professor, do you have
the key to this cabinet?

26:22.348 --> 26:24.582
Of course.

26:24.584 --> 26:28.452
But you're only going
to find my personal papers.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.963
And what might this be?

26:38.965 --> 26:42.032
Puffer fish?

26:42.034 --> 26:44.902
What is that
doing in there?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.438
At the moment it's
proving your guilt.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.540
Professor Lawrence,

26:49.542 --> 26:52.610
you are under arrest for
the murder of Byron Sutton.

27:00.585 --> 27:04.688
Nary a smudge, sir.
That's unfortunate.

27:04.690 --> 27:07.658
Sir, why would Professor
Lawrence wipe his fingermarks

27:07.660 --> 27:09.693
off a bottle of poison
only to put it

27:09.695 --> 27:11.362
in his own
personal cabinet?

27:11.364 --> 27:14.865
A rather troubling detail.
Why not just put it back

27:14.867 --> 27:17.334
in his wife's
medicine cabinet?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.870
I'd very much like
to test the contents.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.240
By all means.

27:26.444 --> 27:30.114
This bottle doesn't
contain tetrodon.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.017
But it's labelled puffer fish.
Which it is.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.119
A benign powder
made from the flesh.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.055
Then, the tetrodon must
have come from somewhere else.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.958
Or our conclusions
are incorrect.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.527
I'm afraid Miss James
and I were wrong.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.362
The poison that killed
Byron Sutton was not

27:45.364 --> 27:49.033
from the puffer fish.
Was not? You're quite certain?

27:49.035 --> 27:51.602
Without a doubt. But
we have yet to discover

27:51.604 --> 27:54.405
the true culprit.
Right then, George,

27:54.407 --> 27:57.374
release Professor Lawrence.
Sir, I will.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.777
Sir, doesn't it seem rather
convenient that we found

27:59.779 --> 28:02.746
exactly what we were looking
for in the Lawrences' cabinet.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.015
I agree, George.
Someone is

28:05.017 --> 28:07.251
trying to lay blame
on Professor Lawrence.

28:07.253 --> 28:10.320
But who could have known? Who
could have known we were looking

28:10.322 --> 28:13.390
specifically for puffer
fish of all things?

28:18.096 --> 28:20.931
(sighing): Right.

28:20.933 --> 28:24.034
All of the suspects were
standing right here

28:24.036 --> 28:26.070
being finger marked.
Any one of them could have

28:26.072 --> 28:28.439
planted that bottle.
Who would have wanted

28:28.441 --> 28:32.176
Byron Sutton killed and
Professor Lawrence blamed?

28:34.446 --> 28:37.081
I'm sure I have no idea what
you're talking about, Detective.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.450
With Byron Sutton dead
and Professor Lawrence

28:39.452 --> 28:42.186
implicated in his murder,
you would be able to shake

28:42.188 --> 28:44.354
your sister loose
of their influence.

28:44.356 --> 28:48.525
Influence is only effective
if it is desired, Detective.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.195
If anything, since Byron's death
her love of all things Chinese

28:51.197 --> 28:53.864
has only deepened. She spends
all her time in Chinatown,

28:53.866 --> 28:58.102
now that the Professor's society
has gone on indefinite hiatus.

28:58.104 --> 29:02.239
A failed plan does not
negate the plan itself.

29:04.175 --> 29:07.244
I wouldn't know puffer fish
powder from talcum powder.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.980
How would I even know which
bottle is the one to choose?

29:09.982 --> 29:12.382
It's written on the label.
Yes,

29:12.384 --> 29:15.185
in Chinese, Detective.
Which I do not speak,

29:15.187 --> 29:17.654
which that cretin Gregory
has never failed to point out.

29:17.656 --> 29:21.492
Gregory Cummings?
Oh yes! Student of the year!

29:21.494 --> 29:23.827
Although his dreams
of that China scholarship

29:23.829 --> 29:26.497
are now as
dead as Byron.

29:26.499 --> 29:31.101
You can read and write
Chinese, I presume.

29:31.103 --> 29:35.906
Of course. I am also fluent
in Mandarin and Cantonese,

29:35.908 --> 29:38.275
and some of the
lesser known dialects.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.678
Mark my words,
China is the future.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.549
So you admit to knowing
the contents of this bottle.

29:45.551 --> 29:49.419
Of course.
Puffer Fish.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.421
Did you have occasion

29:51.423 --> 29:54.424
to visit the Professor after
giving us your fingermarks?

29:54.426 --> 29:57.694
Yes.
To place this bottle

29:57.696 --> 29:59.530
in his private cabinet
thus blaming him

29:59.532 --> 30:03.133
for the murder of Byron Sutton?
Of course not!

30:03.135 --> 30:06.370
I would never,
I swear!

30:06.372 --> 30:09.239
But Susan might.
She was with the Emperor

30:09.241 --> 30:12.609
yesterday. I
saw her myself.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.881
Miss Trent.
Why did you visit

30:17.883 --> 30:20.317
Professor Lawrence's
home yesterday?

30:20.319 --> 30:24.054
The brown fairy
won't visit me anymore.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.056
Sir, she's been going on
about the brown fairy

30:26.058 --> 30:28.992
since I picked her up.
She brings me messages.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.228
Did you place

30:31.230 --> 30:34.398
this bottle in
Prof. Lawrence's cabinet?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.466
The Emperor

30:36.468 --> 30:38.602
won't let me see her.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.804
Miss Trent,

30:40.806 --> 30:43.273
did you murder
Byron Sutton

30:43.275 --> 30:45.742
and frame Prof. Lawrence
for his murder?

30:45.744 --> 30:47.911
Byron and I have a secret.

30:47.913 --> 30:51.815
What's that?
The blossoms will bloom

30:51.817 --> 30:56.053
and we will meet in their sweet
fragrance. He will wait for me.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.193
My God. Sir,
she could barely walk.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.862
I essentially had
to carry her here.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.764
And I couldn't get a coherent
word out of her the whole time.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.633
I wonder if we should

31:09.635 --> 31:12.035
call for a doctor, sir?

31:12.037 --> 31:15.205
I dare say we should.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.975
Detective, you
are a Water Pig.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.711
Did you know that?
No George, I did not.

31:20.713 --> 31:24.214
No, sir, a Water Pig has
a keen sense of observation,

31:24.216 --> 31:26.650
is calm, a good negotiator.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.720
Those all sound quite
accurate. It also says

31:29.722 --> 31:31.488
you have a
tendency to indulge

31:31.490 --> 31:34.725
in excess of vices
in the way of alcohol,

31:34.727 --> 31:37.461
rich foods, and
expensive luxuries.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.230
I suppose it's not
an exact science.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.466
Oh, Dr. Ogden,
what year were you born?

31:42.468 --> 31:46.136
A rather probing question
to ask a lady, Constable.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.672
Oh, I meant no harm doctor,
I'm just really into

31:48.674 --> 31:50.641
this Chinese astrology.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.976
But I suppose there are some
other more work-related issues

31:52.978 --> 31:56.480
that demand
my attention.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.949
Well, Miss Trent
isn't suffering

31:58.951 --> 32:02.386
from any psychological malady,
except perhaps a mild delusion.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.088
Anything else?
She is intoxicated;

32:05.090 --> 32:09.726
roaringly.
It's the opiates, most likely.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.561
Miss Trent seems
to think that Mr. Sutton

32:11.563 --> 32:14.097
would be waiting for her
amongst the blossoms...

32:14.099 --> 32:16.400
Sounds like
a romantic fantasy.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.936
Yes, except there was
a similar such reference

32:18.938 --> 32:21.538
to fragrant blossoms
in the letter

32:21.540 --> 32:25.042
that the professor's wife
wrote to Mr. Sutton.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.810
It could be the sort
of amorous allusion

32:26.812 --> 32:30.547
Mr. Sutton was fond
of making to his lady friends?

32:30.549 --> 32:33.283
Julia, Miss Trent claims

32:33.285 --> 32:36.219
she has heard from
Mr. Sutton since his passing.

32:36.221 --> 32:40.223
Could she
be hallucinating?

32:40.225 --> 32:43.126
In my acquaintance
with smoking opium,

32:43.128 --> 32:47.264
hallucinations are not
part of the experience.

32:47.266 --> 32:51.068
And you say the senses
are not dulled?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.136
Rather enhanced.
Instead of a dormant brain,

32:53.138 --> 32:56.073
I feel
broadened perspectives,

32:56.075 --> 32:58.241
deeper thoughts,
a heightened sense

32:58.243 --> 33:02.112
that all things are possible.
Pipe dreams, you mean.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.348
Hence the term.
Epiphanies are common.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.017
It's a release
of mental inhibition.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.586
Then, the sensation

33:09.588 --> 33:12.055
allows the smoker to experience

33:12.057 --> 33:14.057
reality differently?

33:14.059 --> 33:17.461
Yes... and no. Uh,

33:17.463 --> 33:21.765
The opium, when smoked, it's
an almost ethereal experience.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.468
I could no more describe it
to you than I could describe

33:24.470 --> 33:27.437
a rainbow to a blind man.
I see.

33:27.439 --> 33:31.041
Perhaps I can help you
in a different way.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.410
I can offer you the opportunity

33:33.412 --> 33:36.580
to experience
opium for yourself,

33:36.582 --> 33:38.448
safely and purely.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.284
Oh, I don't --
Please, I urge you

33:41.286 --> 33:45.055
to do whatever you must
to find Byron's killer.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.424
It may open your mind

33:47.426 --> 33:50.560
to a path you had
previously not seen.

33:50.562 --> 33:54.131
A scientific experiment.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.014
Well?

34:11.016 --> 34:13.016
I don't know...

34:13.018 --> 34:16.586
(snickering softly):
I do feel relaxed...

34:16.588 --> 34:20.357
calm... content.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.593
My nose is itchy.
(chuckles)

34:23.595 --> 34:26.196
Mine too!

34:26.198 --> 34:29.032
Ah...

34:29.034 --> 34:33.036
I feel the most delicious
tingling in my body,

34:33.038 --> 34:37.541
like all of my senses
are on fire.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.744
I understand now

34:40.746 --> 34:44.481
how opium awakens
an appetite...

34:44.483 --> 34:47.651
I'm not hungry
in the slightest.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.986
(little snicker from Dr. Ogden)

34:49.988 --> 34:52.722
...of a more
carnal nature...

34:52.724 --> 34:55.659
(Both snicker.)

34:55.661 --> 34:58.995
Julia. We are not alone.

34:58.997 --> 35:02.999
I see no one.
No one but you.

35:05.870 --> 35:08.438
Ah!
Oh!

35:08.440 --> 35:11.575
(chuckles)

35:15.246 --> 35:17.914
William...

35:17.916 --> 35:21.051
look at this dragon.

35:21.053 --> 35:24.521
It's as though it could
breathe fire at any moment.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.724
You're seeing the red
of the dragon's mouth

35:27.726 --> 35:31.294
and interpreting
it as fire.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.296
William,

35:33.298 --> 35:35.799
I'm aware that I am
looking at a tapestry

35:35.801 --> 35:38.034
and not an actual dragon.

35:38.036 --> 35:41.037
You might find
this experience

35:41.039 --> 35:44.040
more beneficial if
you ceased to analyze it

35:44.042 --> 35:46.510
and just embrace it.

35:49.981 --> 35:54.584
Did you know, Julia,
that in Ancient China,

35:54.586 --> 35:56.987
only Emperors were allowed

35:56.989 --> 35:59.656
to depict five clawed dragons?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.858
Anyone found in possession

36:01.860 --> 36:05.228
of such things
was put to death.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.864
Then I suppose
Byron Sutton

36:07.866 --> 36:09.432
was willing to
invoke the wrath...

36:09.434 --> 36:12.169
(snickering): ...
of the ancients.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.338
How so?
His pipe

36:15.340 --> 36:19.009
has an engraving of a dragon
with five claws on it.

36:19.011 --> 36:22.479
Remarkably, it's
just like this one.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.783
Even my students wouldn't dare
to possess a five-clawed dragon.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.853
Julia...

36:29.855 --> 36:36.159
Byron Sutton didn't custom order
that opium pipe for himself.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.263
He bought it
for Prof. Lawrence.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.232
His Emperor.

36:42.234 --> 36:45.802
So, Byron Sutton wasn't
meant to die that night.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.639
Professor Lawrence was.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.213
We believe the pipe
that killed Mr. Sutton

36:56.215 --> 36:58.615
was meant to be
a gift for you.

36:58.617 --> 37:04.487
For me?

37:04.489 --> 37:06.256
Oh my God.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.392
I thought Byron was just
showing me his new pipe.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.529
He was trying
to give it to me.

37:12.531 --> 37:15.498
Did you not see the
five-clawed dragon depicted?

37:15.500 --> 37:18.835
I didn't even look at it.
I was on my way out,

37:18.837 --> 37:21.338
I barely let him speak...

37:21.340 --> 37:24.007
I insisted
that Byron christen

37:24.009 --> 37:26.009
his new pipe
at our next session.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.812
Byron put it away
in the cupboard and...

37:30.414 --> 37:33.850
Who would have
done this, Detective?

37:33.852 --> 37:36.586
I didn't know Byron bought
the pipe for my husband.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.956
He didn't tell me.
Mrs. Lawrence,

37:39.958 --> 37:43.727
you must realize that all of the
evidence points directly to you.

37:43.729 --> 37:47.864
Did you not consider my
husband is lying about the pipe?

37:47.866 --> 37:50.066
He is the one who was
hiding the puffer fish

37:50.068 --> 37:52.569
in his personal cabinet.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.437
The poison that
killed Byron Sutton

37:54.439 --> 37:57.274
was not from the puffer fish.
Of course it was!

37:57.276 --> 38:00.377
Why else would he be hiding it?
He wasn't hiding it.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.646
It was put there.
By you.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.748
You saw it written
on my chalkboard.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.983
You hoped your husband
would pay for the crime

38:06.985 --> 38:10.053
and you would be free.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.224
I hoped
he would pay, yes,

38:14.226 --> 38:16.660
but because
I thought him guilty.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.062
You must believe me,

38:19.064 --> 38:21.031
if I had
poisoned that pipe,

38:21.033 --> 38:23.433
I would never have
let Byron smoke it.

38:25.836 --> 38:29.506
Perhaps we should revisit
our earlier assumptions.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.275
We believed the poison
was an alkaloid

38:32.277 --> 38:34.678
because that was our only
positive test result.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.214
I suppose we could try some
of the plants we didn't test.

38:38.216 --> 38:42.152
I know it seems
like a waste of time,
but it may be worth our while.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.789
I can't believe
you smoked opium.

38:45.791 --> 38:49.359
Ah! Well, all
in the name of science.

38:49.361 --> 38:52.228
I've taken laudanum
once, when I broke my leg.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.632
It eased the pain
but I didn't care for
how dull it made my mind feel.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.535
That's what's extraordinary.
Opium when smoked

38:58.537 --> 39:01.004
is more of a stimulant
than a depressant.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.373
How did it feel?
Well,

39:03.375 --> 39:06.209
first, I felt a tingling
in my extremities

39:06.211 --> 39:08.211
and then, it spread
to my whole body--

39:08.213 --> 39:10.747
Did you say a tingling?
Like pins and needles?

39:10.749 --> 39:14.517
Yes, just like that.
What if what you said

39:14.519 --> 39:16.853
originally was true?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.823
That the opium counteracted
the effects of the poison.

39:19.825 --> 39:23.827
Not counteracted; masked.
Here it is:

39:23.829 --> 39:25.862
"Pins and needles,
muscle paralysis

39:25.864 --> 39:29.099
and, sometimes, seizures!

39:29.101 --> 39:31.334
What if when Mr. Sutton
felt the pins and needles,

39:31.336 --> 39:34.771
he attributed it to the opium?
Making him unaware

39:34.773 --> 39:37.173
of the warning signs.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.676
It was the very first
poison we considered.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.444
Aconite!

39:41.446 --> 39:44.314
Byron Sutton's killer
was simple wolfsbane.

39:48.352 --> 39:53.022
Do you sell wolfsbane?
Wolfsbane?

39:53.024 --> 39:55.525
Aconite.
Ah, <i>Fu Zi!</i>

39:55.527 --> 39:58.795
Much of it, yes.
Very good for pain.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.531
Have you ever sold it
in its raw plant form?

40:01.533 --> 40:04.868
Yes, some. To Mrs. Lawrence.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.637
Anyone else?

40:07.639 --> 40:10.473
Yes. White man.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.809
Nervous. He knew
the Chinese name,

40:12.811 --> 40:17.480
<i>Fu Zi.</i> Otherwise I would not
sell it. Very dangerous.

40:17.482 --> 40:20.884
Do you recall his name?
He was here before.

40:20.886 --> 40:24.788
He paid for a translation.
I will check my ledger.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.624
Thank you.

40:29.393 --> 40:31.661
(coughing in the background)

40:47.912 --> 40:49.746
Is Byron here?

40:49.748 --> 40:52.816
Byron Sutton is
dead, Miss Trent.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.084
No.

40:55.086 --> 40:58.154
He sent me a message.

40:59.323 --> 41:01.357
The brown fairy
read it to me.

41:01.359 --> 41:04.227
We will meet
in the poppy fields.

41:04.229 --> 41:07.397
The blossoms so fragrant.

41:07.399 --> 41:11.768
The earth dragon might
want to keep us apart,

41:11.770 --> 41:14.437
<i>but I am his water goat</i>

41:14.439 --> 41:19.709
<i>and he is my golden dragon...</i>

41:19.711 --> 41:22.045
...soon we will meet
by the poppy field

41:22.047 --> 41:26.416
and spend all our days
in sweet embrace

41:26.418 --> 41:29.586
among the fragrant blossoms.

41:29.588 --> 41:32.422
(Mr. Sutton): <i>This letter</i>
<i>arrived for Byron today.</i>

41:32.424 --> 41:34.691
<i>I thought you might</i>
<i>want to see it.</i>

41:36.961 --> 41:40.597
A package arrived
to your home... from China.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.799
Your son must have told you
that it contained a gift

41:42.801 --> 41:45.568
for Professor Lawrence.
He spent his money -

41:45.570 --> 41:49.672
our family's money -
on an opium pipe for that man.

41:49.674 --> 41:53.576
You poisoned the bowl
of the opium pipe.

41:53.578 --> 41:56.679
You couldn't have known that
Professor Lawrence would refuse

41:56.681 --> 42:00.850
the gift and that your son Byron
would be the first to smoke it.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.686
So you brought us the letter
detailing your son's affair

42:03.688 --> 42:07.390
with Mrs. Lawrence. You knew it
would point us to the Professor.

42:07.392 --> 42:10.193
Professor Lawrence
killed my son.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.795
With his dragons and opium

42:12.797 --> 42:14.764
and that Chinese
siren of a wife.

42:14.766 --> 42:17.433
I'm afraid that
isn't true, Dr. Sutton.

42:17.435 --> 42:20.703
My Byron was under a spell.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.140
I had to break that spell.
I had no choice!

42:24.142 --> 42:26.743
He was going to leave me.

42:26.745 --> 42:30.246
You killed your own son,

42:30.248 --> 42:32.215
you foolish man.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.084
That Professor is to blame.

42:35.086 --> 42:38.087
He is the one you
should put behind bars.

42:38.089 --> 42:41.558
Do you hear me, man?

42:41.560 --> 42:45.562
It was Lawrence. He was supposed
to smoke that damn pipe.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.797
Dr. Sutton,
you are under arrest

42:47.799 --> 42:50.166
for the murder of Byron Sutton.

42:50.168 --> 42:53.069
It was Lawrence!

42:53.071 --> 42:56.172
It was his fault,

42:56.174 --> 42:58.975
it's not mine.

42:58.977 --> 43:01.411
Not mine.

43:06.216 --> 43:08.217
Despite the darker
side of opium,

43:08.219 --> 43:10.787
I'll admit: I enjoyed
our little experiment.

43:10.789 --> 43:13.790
Yes. Not one that
I would care to repeat.

43:13.792 --> 43:17.026
No? Not even
the sensation it invoked?

43:17.028 --> 43:20.630
I prefer not
to alter my reality.

43:20.632 --> 43:23.366
And why is that?
Because...

43:23.368 --> 43:27.737
nothing could make my reality
any better than it already is.

43:27.739 --> 43:30.273
(little snicker)

43:31.609 --> 43:34.577
(theme music)
