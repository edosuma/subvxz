00:21.600 --> 00:23.219
- Sometimes I forget how serious Boss

00:23.220 --> 00:24.289
takes these night missions.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.122
- I know, right?

00:25.123 --> 00:26.709
It's just a training exercise.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.060
The man needs to calm down.

00:29.690 --> 00:30.740
- Hold up, Pocketman.

00:32.710 --> 00:33.849
Where's Miniskirt?

00:33.850 --> 00:35.059
- She's checking out the front.

00:35.060 --> 00:35.893
Why?

00:36.936 --> 00:38.706
- Well, Boss is all the way back there,

00:38.707 --> 00:42.689
you already took out Painkiller, so...

00:42.690 --> 00:45.359
- So that means Hackawackie
is the only one inside

00:45.360 --> 00:46.659
guarding the flag!

00:46.660 --> 00:49.889
- Exactly! Wait, flag?

00:49.890 --> 00:50.722
- Call it what you want,

00:50.723 --> 00:53.273
this is basically just
capture the flag agent style.

00:58.162 --> 00:59.659
- That's why I'm not good at it.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.719
- How many times have I told
you never let your guard down?

01:02.720 --> 01:04.719
- Go! Get Miniskirt.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.896
You guys can take on Hackawackie.

01:06.897 --> 01:08.179
- Are you sure?

01:08.180 --> 01:09.012
- Just go!

01:09.013 --> 01:10.113
I got this.

01:11.478 --> 01:12.929
- You should've worked together.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.469
Now you're in trouble.

01:14.470 --> 01:15.519
- I can handle it.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.435
- Maybe. But it's always a
bad idea to always work alone.

01:30.003 --> 01:31.310
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:31.311 --> 01:32.709
- We have to hurry.

01:32.710 --> 01:33.542
Boss is right behind us.

01:33.543 --> 01:36.639
Pocketman took out Painkiller
so we just need to get inside,

01:36.640 --> 01:39.629
get past Hackawackie
and grab the medallion.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.719
- I can't see him through any windows

01:41.720 --> 01:44.719
and we have no idea where
they hid the medallion.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.203
- Then may the force be with
us because we're out of time!

02:01.122 --> 02:02.705
- You can go first.

02:11.140 --> 02:12.829
- It's down that hall.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.279
- But that's where Mark is.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.149
He must have made that noise.

02:16.150 --> 02:18.619
- Yeah. That's probably
where the medallion is.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.929
I would assume he is staying close to it.

02:20.930 --> 02:23.093
- Or it was a distraction.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.553
- It's him.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.309
- You won't always catch
your enemy by surprise.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.299
In reality they might
even be waiting for you.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.369
- Isn't this cheating?

02:45.370 --> 02:48.020
You're like the greatest
fighter ever and I'm a nerd.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.087
- Of course.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.633
Your enemy might also physically
be holding what you need.

03:01.340 --> 03:02.829
- Just think about it.

03:02.830 --> 03:05.969
You two stop me and
continue on with Lindsey.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.929
You can't do this all alone.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.399
- I wasn't trying to do it alone.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.959
I just thought I could
have a head start if I...

03:10.960 --> 03:12.189
- Sacrificed yourself?

03:12.190 --> 03:13.703
Stop with the drama.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.289
- I know you're capable.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.519
It's not about that or your skill.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.999
It's about using your resources.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.479
Don't risk your life just to
finish the mission faster.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.969
- I wasn't risking my life.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.439
- It's always a risk

03:29.440 --> 03:31.969
when you are uncertain of
what you're up against.

03:31.970 --> 03:35.079
There are always consequences
for the wrong choices.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.489
I'm not going to, but if I wanted

03:37.490 --> 03:38.940
I'd catch up with the others.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.259
- That looked like it went well.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.283
- He's reckless.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.099
He means well, but he's just so reckless.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.183
- Give him a chance.

03:57.230 --> 03:59.429
Harrison extended the
program for a reason.

03:59.430 --> 04:01.737
He believes in it and
that means something.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.483
And remember Jay, you
were reckless once too.

04:20.847 --> 04:21.859
- Sorry Lindsey.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.960
Looks like you're out.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.893
- Hey, I thought Jay said no M-locks!

04:29.930 --> 04:30.939
- That was last week.

04:30.940 --> 04:32.879
It's no scanners.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.002
Crap. I need
to pay better attention.

04:45.090 --> 04:47.219
- Yes Cargoboy, I know.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.053
You won.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.804
- I'm sorry, I what?

04:52.805 --> 04:54.049
Won.

04:54.050 --> 04:55.591
- I like how that feels.

04:55.592 --> 04:57.919
Winner, winner chicken dinner.

04:57.920 --> 04:58.752
Victory.

04:58.753 --> 05:01.159
- You know, this is what gets
you shot in real missions,

05:01.160 --> 05:02.399
right?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.679
- I'm sorry, did you say something?

05:04.680 --> 05:05.763
I don't speak loser.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.859
- I can still make you do push-ups.

05:08.860 --> 05:09.879
- Yep, sure.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.003
- Wait Cargoboy.

05:11.852 --> 05:12.696
Let me down.

05:12.697 --> 05:14.417
I don't have a key.

05:14.418 --> 05:15.918
Cargoboy! Come on.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.399
- Everyone did the homework right?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.689
- Yep.
-  Yes.

06:44.690 --> 06:45.522
- Good, good.

06:45.523 --> 06:46.889
Outstanding!

06:46.890 --> 06:48.729
- From chapter 16, right?

06:48.730 --> 06:50.569
- Um, no.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.999
Today we will be taking a test on

06:53.000 --> 06:54.859
decoding the Pythagorean theorem

06:54.860 --> 06:56.469
and differential equations.

06:56.470 --> 06:58.469
I've also added a few
questions on the topic of

06:58.470 --> 07:00.729
stochastic adaptive control.

07:00.730 --> 07:01.563
Hmm!

07:02.640 --> 07:03.969
- What?

07:03.970 --> 07:07.549
- This test will count for
10% of your monthly grade.

07:07.550 --> 07:08.382
Trigger warning.

07:08.383 --> 07:10.559
If I get hiccups it is only because

07:10.560 --> 07:13.859
I am so excited for this test!

07:13.860 --> 07:14.923
Any questions?

07:16.660 --> 07:19.539
Can we use a calculator?

07:19.540 --> 07:20.749
- No.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.489
- Can we use the book?

07:22.490 --> 07:23.559
- No.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.349
- Can we use scratch paper?

07:25.350 --> 07:26.319
- No.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.373
- Can we use the internet?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.999
- What do you think?

07:31.000 --> 07:31.832
- All right.

07:31.833 --> 07:32.893
Let's all take a deep breath.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.479
It's quiet time.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.343
Begin!

07:40.880 --> 07:43.169
- Hey, eyes on your own screen.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.083
Now!

07:45.330 --> 07:46.479
- I'm not even cheating.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.209
I haven't even started the test.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.299
I can still hear "Begin,"

07:50.300 --> 07:52.133
bouncing off the walls in this room.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.158
- Stupid teachers.

08:15.316 --> 08:16.888
All agents
need to be cautious!

08:16.889 --> 08:18.044
In what we can only assume

08:18.045 --> 08:19.619
was the first of many
Sir Longbottom attacks

08:19.620 --> 08:22.289
the entire office led by Tyler
Gennard has lost their lives.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.451
Please be careful since it
appears that Sir Longbottom

08:24.452 --> 08:27.494
can control more than one mind at a time.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.540
- There's a storm coming.

08:35.990 --> 08:37.349
- I stayed up late working on this.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.109
I didn't think I'd get it done in time.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.260
- I know, I worked all
night on this essay.

08:42.530 --> 08:43.659
- Let me see what you got.

08:43.660 --> 08:44.493
- All right.

08:52.550 --> 08:53.382
- What is this?

08:53.383 --> 08:54.699
- I'll be taking this assignment

08:54.700 --> 08:57.773
and we'll be diving
right into the next one!

08:59.510 --> 09:01.703
Dare I ask what my eyes are seeing?

09:04.030 --> 09:05.779
- Sunshine, that's not at all...

09:05.780 --> 09:07.359
- I'm disappointed.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.499
But, I'm always disappointed,
it's nothing new.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.332
- But...

09:11.333 --> 09:13.349
- No. Quiet please!

09:13.350 --> 09:17.339
Today I had planned on going
over the next vocabulary lesson

09:17.340 --> 09:18.172
in the book,

09:18.173 --> 09:20.089
however the Boss himself has asked that

09:20.090 --> 09:22.559
I give you an extra
special research project.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.819
Jay would like you to write a paper

09:24.820 --> 09:27.259
on the history of Sir Longbottom.

09:27.260 --> 09:31.003
This includes birth and known
life achievements up to now.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.322
- Question.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.242
All right, what is it?

09:35.243 --> 09:37.599
- This sounds more like
a history assignment.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.979
- That's not a question.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.267
- I think what Pocketman was...

09:41.268 --> 09:44.435
Pocketman.

09:52.110 --> 09:53.003
Oh gosh.

09:55.980 --> 10:00.689
Sorry, your name is just
ridiculous, whosever it is.

10:00.690 --> 10:01.740
Whichever one of you.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.499
Every time I hear Pocketman

10:04.500 --> 10:06.559
I think about this guy
I knew in high school

10:06.560 --> 10:08.699
who would take mashed
potatoes and put them in his,

10:08.700 --> 10:09.532
it's not important.

10:09.533 --> 10:10.793
What were you saying?

10:12.570 --> 10:16.369
- Anyway, I think what
Pocketman was trying to say was,

10:16.370 --> 10:20.449
why aren't we learning about
Sir Longbottom in a history

10:20.450 --> 10:21.282
class instead?

10:21.283 --> 10:24.179
- Ah. Well, starting
this week you will be.

10:24.180 --> 10:26.369
Diane and I are teaming
up to teach you about

10:26.370 --> 10:29.509
the stranger dangers of Sir Longbottom.

10:29.510 --> 10:30.919
- Shoot.

10:30.920 --> 10:35.369
- I'm out of plain, bland, black coffee.

10:35.370 --> 10:36.349
I'm gonna get some more.

10:36.350 --> 10:40.019
Pick out, read any page in
the book until I get back.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.237
- Any page?

10:41.238 --> 10:43.885
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, blah, blah, blah!

10:45.710 --> 10:49.010
- I swear, she gets crazier every day.

10:51.690 --> 10:53.189
- All right. Let's get started.

10:53.190 --> 10:56.469
What year did Ponce de Leon
discover the fountain of youth?

10:56.470 --> 10:57.743
- Ooh I know this one.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.699
1521.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.369
- That is correct.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.119
- Do I get a Kit Kat bar?

11:04.120 --> 11:07.209
- No, candy quizzes are only on Thursdays.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.189
- Please continue.

11:08.190 --> 11:10.649
This drama queen will get over it.

11:10.650 --> 11:13.175
- But chocolate sounds so good!

11:15.170 --> 11:17.239
- I should have become a lawyer.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.829
All right. Ponce de Leon first
sailed to Florida in 1513

11:20.830 --> 11:23.029
but was unable to find
the fountain of youth.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.739
He decided to return eight years later

11:24.740 --> 11:26.619
and this time was successful.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.019
Soon after, he was brutally murdered

11:28.020 --> 11:28.909
by the only man who has ever

11:28.910 --> 11:31.059
been able to drink from the fountain.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.839
- Let me guess, Sir Longbottom?

11:33.840 --> 11:34.869
- Yes.

11:34.870 --> 11:36.899
- He's been alive for that long?

11:36.900 --> 11:41.900
So the fountain of youth
does make you live forever?

11:42.050 --> 11:42.979
- Not exactly.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.599
One could essentially become immortal,

11:44.600 --> 11:46.049
but not from one drink.

11:46.050 --> 11:47.299
The liquid has a special property

11:47.300 --> 11:48.819
that reverses the aging process.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.419
So your mind remains intact,

11:50.420 --> 11:52.979
but your body immediately changes.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.769
- Take small drinks over time
and you'll always stay young.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.019
That's genius!

11:57.020 --> 12:01.279
- Speaking of genius, Sir
Longbottom has an IQ of over 155.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.479
- Does the fountain still exist?

12:03.480 --> 12:04.949
- About a year after it's discovery

12:04.950 --> 12:06.999
Sir Longbottom destroyed the fountain.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.609
He had quickly learned
how the magic worked

12:08.610 --> 12:10.660
and filled a single vile with the liquid.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.713
- Hey Boss.

12:18.932 --> 12:22.519
- Ooh, no way, our badges came in.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.353
Nice!

12:25.260 --> 12:27.010
- I know this is a big day for you.

12:28.270 --> 12:30.479
- How come mine says Trevor
Doyle and not Pocketman?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.999
- Your name is Trevor Doyle bud.

12:33.000 --> 12:33.903
Did you forget?

12:35.100 --> 12:36.599
- Can't you just be grateful?

12:36.600 --> 12:37.739
- No, it's not that.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.804
It's just I like Pocketman better.

12:39.805 --> 12:40.939
You're lucky you're cute.

12:40.940 --> 12:43.213
- All right agents, listen up.

12:44.429 --> 12:46.199
We are gonna continue
where we left off last week

12:46.200 --> 12:48.043
with our discussion of holograms.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.746
Who can briefly describe
to me the science and

12:52.747 --> 12:55.069
practice making of holograms?

12:55.070 --> 12:56.219
- I got this.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.039
A hologram is a three-dimensional image

12:58.040 --> 13:01.069
that you can see without
the need of special glasses.

13:01.070 --> 13:04.809
It's a recording of a light field.

13:04.810 --> 13:05.643
- Very good.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.049
- Show off.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.669
- Okay.

13:10.670 --> 13:13.889
Who can tell me what
holographic interferometry is?

13:13.890 --> 13:15.219
- A technique that enables

13:15.220 --> 13:17.629
static and dynamic
displacements of objects

13:17.630 --> 13:19.509
with rough surfaces to be measured

13:19.510 --> 13:21.989
to optical interferometric precision.

13:21.990 --> 13:24.629
- It can also be used to detect
optical length variations

13:24.630 --> 13:25.749
in transparent media.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.829
I'm surrounded by know-it-alls.

13:26.830 --> 13:28.853
- Please turn to page 277.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.719
- Holographic weapon sight?

13:32.720 --> 13:33.769
Cool.

13:33.770 --> 13:38.010
- Holographic weapon sight,
or diffraction sight.

13:39.116 --> 13:42.109
It's a non-magnifying
gunsight that allows the user

13:42.110 --> 13:44.319
to see a holographic reticule image

13:44.320 --> 13:46.173
superimposed on the field of view.

13:47.350 --> 13:48.223
- This is boring.

13:51.110 --> 13:52.760
- This is stuff you need to know.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.749
Please read the next
five paragraphs quietly.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.059
When you're done I'll
have worksheets for you.

13:59.060 --> 14:00.649
Any questions?

14:00.650 --> 14:01.482
- No sir.

14:01.483 --> 14:02.813
- Good. Read.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.589
Can I join you?

14:22.590 --> 14:23.423
- Sure.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.640
- I can't believe we've been
married almost four months now.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.430
- It seems like it was just yesterday.

14:38.830 --> 14:41.533
So, what's going on?

14:42.375 --> 14:43.325
- What do you mean?

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
- I can tell something has you stressed.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.519
- I'm fine.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.799
- Okay, I know you Jay,

14:52.800 --> 14:55.739
and also I'm fine is pretty
much universal code for

14:55.740 --> 14:56.973
I'm not fine.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.793
Is it Sir Longbottom?

15:03.020 --> 15:03.852
- Yeah.

15:05.070 --> 15:09.053
He took out Tyler and his team of agents.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.649
- I thought he was in hiding?

15:12.650 --> 15:13.600
- That's the thing.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.763
No one knows what he's been
doing for the last 30 years.

15:18.730 --> 15:21.623
No one has seen him or
talked to him or anything.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.150
I'm pretty sure he's planning
some kind of attack though.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.725
- Tyler's office is right near here.

15:29.726 --> 15:31.176
You think we are a target!

15:32.060 --> 15:32.893
- I do.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.259
But until we have more information,

15:35.260 --> 15:38.283
I think we should treat the
situation like we're at war.

15:39.610 --> 15:41.382
- Why didn't you tell any of us?

15:41.383 --> 15:43.729
- I didn't wanna freak anyone out yet.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.379
I talked to Harrison
about all this yesterday

15:46.380 --> 15:51.380
and he wants Decker and his
team to stay with us for now.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.859
- Does that include Natalie?

15:52.860 --> 15:56.169
- Diane, it's only because
there's safety in numbers.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.259
- So it does include Natalie.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.079
- That's history.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.059
You know she works for Decker!

16:01.060 --> 16:03.443
Along with two agents and two trainees.

16:04.670 --> 16:05.720
- They have kids too?

16:08.030 --> 16:10.519
- Well, when Harrison extended the program

16:10.520 --> 16:13.033
he branched out and opened a second base.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.310
- I didn't know that.

16:16.335 --> 16:18.739
And I'm proud of everything
that you have accomplished.

16:18.740 --> 16:19.759
No matter what anyone says,

16:19.760 --> 16:21.710
you always manage to do the impossible.

16:23.410 --> 16:24.243
- Thank you.

16:26.124 --> 16:27.239
- All right.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.703
When are they all getting here?

16:31.820 --> 16:33.423
- First thing in the morning.

16:36.780 --> 16:38.299
Hey, is that your mom?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.139
Yep.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.429
- I can see where you
get your good looks from.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.479
Wait, didn't your mom used to date Boss?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.389
- Dude, we can call her Hex!

16:46.390 --> 16:47.222
- Hex?

16:47.223 --> 16:49.669
- It's like a squished
together one heck of an ex.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.369
- That's not bad.

16:51.370 --> 16:52.720
Don't make this weird.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.009
- Too late.
- Too late.

16:54.010 --> 16:55.953
- Just so we're all on the same page.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.069
Decker and his agents
are gonna be staying here

16:59.070 --> 17:00.063
for a few weeks.

17:01.070 --> 17:04.843
There is Fred Spade, Natalie Evans,

17:06.220 --> 17:07.363
and John Rogers.

17:08.350 --> 17:12.209
They also have two
trainees, Caleb and Alice.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.453
- Yeah, is your first
name actually Decker?

17:15.290 --> 17:17.329
- That's just what
everyone always calls me.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.209
My name is Herbert.

17:19.210 --> 17:21.499
- Wow. Okay, I'm gonna call you Decker.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.332
Just curious.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.619
Continue.

17:23.620 --> 17:26.979
- Anyway, there are
gonna be a lot of people

17:26.980 --> 17:28.659
under this roof.

17:28.660 --> 17:32.149
I ask that we are all kind and respectful.

17:32.150 --> 17:35.189
We don't know what to
expect from Sir Longbottom,

17:35.190 --> 17:36.290
but we wanna be ready.

17:37.420 --> 17:40.420
In the meantime, our day-to-day
will basically stay the same

17:41.450 --> 17:43.019
until we have reason to panic.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.019
- So wait, you're telling me
that we might have to panic

17:47.020 --> 17:49.249
because of the size of a man's bottom?

17:49.250 --> 17:50.082
How long could it be?

17:50.083 --> 17:50.915
I'm confused.

17:50.916 --> 17:51.973
- Not really.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.829
Before I answer that does
anyone else have any questions?

17:55.830 --> 17:57.549
- I have a question.

17:57.550 --> 17:58.719
- Yes, Amy.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.619
- Wait Amy?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.452
What are you...

18:00.453 --> 18:01.769
- I followed everyone in.

18:01.770 --> 18:02.939
I wanted to check

18:02.940 --> 18:05.783
and see how your foreign
exchange students are doing?

18:07.060 --> 18:08.933
- My English is much better.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.949
- Yesh, Jayren is vary good learner man.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.809
- Wow, they sound good!

18:15.810 --> 18:17.339
I'm impressed.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.829
You know, I must admit I wasn't
sure you had it in you Jay,

18:20.830 --> 18:22.733
but you proved me wrong.

18:24.130 --> 18:25.149
- Who are you?

18:25.150 --> 18:28.819
- I met these kids when they
first arrived from Uganda.

18:28.820 --> 18:31.319
- I don't know what you're talking about.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.559
- She heard them speak, right?

18:32.560 --> 18:34.519
They were literally just talking.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.719
Is this like an education
joke, because if so,

18:36.720 --> 18:37.552
I'm not amused.

18:37.553 --> 18:39.969
- Amy. can I speak to you outside please?

18:39.970 --> 18:43.003
- It was very nice to see you both again.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.799
What was that about?

18:46.800 --> 18:47.849
- She lives next door.

18:47.850 --> 18:49.779
Jay told her we were from
Uganda and can't speak English

18:49.780 --> 18:51.639
to cover up all her
government-related questions.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.629
It was actually kinda funny.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.289
- Did anybody see her come in?

18:54.290 --> 18:56.239
She just popped up.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.413
What are you doing?

19:01.310 --> 19:02.610
- I don't wanna miss this.

19:09.119 --> 19:10.869
- Brutal. That's hot!

19:20.740 --> 19:22.349
- All right. Listen up!

19:22.350 --> 19:25.099
During this time there will be
a lot of us under this roof.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.379
Like Jay said we need you
to take advantage of this

19:27.380 --> 19:29.113
and learn as much as possible.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.189
Classes such as this will be
taken by all of you at once

19:32.190 --> 19:34.419
to try and keep us on schedule.

19:34.420 --> 19:35.409
Decker's gonna take two of you

19:35.410 --> 19:36.879
and I'll take the other three.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.609
Please split up now and we'll get started.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.760
- You two come with me.

19:41.890 --> 19:42.722
- Hey.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.939
We have to give you a nickname.

19:43.940 --> 19:45.119
- No thank you.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.739
- Probably not cool enough anyway, right?

19:46.740 --> 19:48.219
Just messing with you.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.052
- My dad is an agent.

19:49.053 --> 19:50.962
He thinks that this will be good for me.

19:50.963 --> 19:52.299
- The strongest and most skilled fighter

19:52.300 --> 19:54.249
won't be able to beat
the smartest fighter.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.119
Kyle, show me what you got.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.449
During this lesson I won't
throw a single punch.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.600
I'm ready when you are.

20:10.031 --> 20:13.269
- I have really good grades
and I'm really smart,

20:13.270 --> 20:15.423
I just don't like to be social.

20:16.460 --> 20:19.729
Anything that makes me talk out
loud to more than two people

20:19.730 --> 20:21.023
makes my face swell up.

20:21.890 --> 20:23.453
- Yeah, okay.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.189
- Lindsey, you're gonna be attacking

20:26.190 --> 20:27.689
and Trevor I want you to defend.

20:27.690 --> 20:28.739
After a few minutes, we'll swap out

20:28.740 --> 20:30.609
and Caleb you can get a turn.

20:30.610 --> 20:31.969
Let's go.

20:31.970 --> 20:33.159
- This will be interesting.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.629
- Bring it on.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.789
- You can't handle me.

20:35.790 --> 20:37.339
- You're joking, right?

20:37.340 --> 20:38.995
- Kyle, what did we learn?

20:38.996 --> 20:41.019
- How to be embarrassed in front of girls.

20:41.020 --> 20:41.999
- How you can give yourself an edge

20:42.000 --> 20:44.059
by wearing out the enemy.

20:44.060 --> 20:44.939
- Oh.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.919
- If your opponent wastes
their energy early in a fight

20:46.920 --> 20:49.739
you can really change the tide later on.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.719
Alice you're up,

20:50.720 --> 20:51.763
Kyle you defend.

20:55.281 --> 20:57.909
- How do you guys think
Boss's meeting went today?

20:57.910 --> 20:59.319
- You know, I think it went pretty well.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.479
I kinda zoned out part of the way.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.343
But, I mean,

21:03.344 --> 21:05.103
it was good enough.
- It was good enough.

21:05.970 --> 21:07.184
- Remember Brazil?

21:07.185 --> 21:10.333
- Oh my God, you go so sick.

21:10.334 --> 21:11.639
Sean Connery.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.944
- That's who I thought he looked like.

21:12.945 --> 21:13.926
Who?

21:13.927 --> 21:15.448
- Sean Connery.

21:15.449 --> 21:16.922
.

21:16.923 --> 21:18.659
You know what, never mind.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.039
- Not everywhere.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.848
- I have no clue who that is.

21:21.849 --> 21:23.911
- I have no idea.

21:23.912 --> 21:24.744
- I don't know.

21:24.745 --> 21:26.669
He looks kind of like a pirate.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.827
What? John...

21:29.800 --> 21:30.632
- Rogers.

21:30.633 --> 21:31.819
It sounds like I've heard this name.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.336
My goodness.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.009
- Everyone quiet.

21:36.010 --> 21:36.842
Quiet please!

21:36.843 --> 21:37.675
Cargoboy shhh!

21:37.676 --> 21:38.809
- Of course.

21:38.810 --> 21:40.893
Don't worry sir, we will handle this.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.203
Everyone listen up.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.036
There has been a Sir
Longbottom spotting close by.

21:49.037 --> 21:51.039
More agents have been killed

21:51.040 --> 21:52.426
and Harrison wants me to handle this.

21:52.427 --> 21:54.299
- What's the plan Boss?

21:54.300 --> 21:56.929
- Trevor, Mark, and I will
go face Sir Longbottom.

21:56.930 --> 21:59.119
Diane and Decker you will
stay here and be in charge

21:59.120 --> 22:00.033
until I get back.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.319
- I know Trevor is a good fighter,

22:03.320 --> 22:04.859
but is this the best idea?

22:04.860 --> 22:06.929
- Yes, Trevor will be fine.

22:06.930 --> 22:09.949
We need him, and we need
a strong team to stay back

22:09.950 --> 22:10.903
just in case.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.713
- Trevor, get your gun!

22:14.680 --> 22:16.399
- We're leaving right
now before Sir Longbottom

22:16.400 --> 22:17.818
has a chance to move.

22:17.819 --> 22:21.857
- And I would just like to say
that the ham was overcooked.

22:21.858 --> 22:22.806
- Be careful, okay?

22:22.807 --> 22:26.579
- And the potatoes were
missing some much needed salt.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.673
- You're eating pasta.

22:33.540 --> 22:34.513
- Good luck you guys.

23:29.111 --> 23:30.969
Come on out!

23:30.970 --> 23:32.649
I've been waiting for you.

23:32.650 --> 23:36.069
- Okay, he definitely saw us.

23:36.070 --> 23:37.943
- Don't be shy, that's it.

23:39.230 --> 23:40.513
It's Jayden, right?

23:41.822 --> 23:44.449
Now, I know why you're here,

23:44.450 --> 23:47.173
so please keep your
comments to yourselves.

23:48.980 --> 23:49.813
Let me guess.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.299
Oh, yes.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.039
I have the right to
remain silent and so on.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.423
- He's reading our minds.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.199
- Good for you.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.849
Actually, Jayden, I'm only reading yours.

24:05.850 --> 24:08.979
See, I want to know everything about you.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.699
What makes you tick?

24:10.700 --> 24:13.719
Why are you so important?

24:13.720 --> 24:14.970
- I don't think I follow.

24:15.810 --> 24:18.009
- You and I have been
getting in each other's way

24:18.010 --> 24:21.263
for a very long time,
and yet we've never met.

24:22.180 --> 24:25.803
I use people to get what I want.

24:26.910 --> 24:29.953
You make it difficult for
those people to deliver.

24:31.080 --> 24:35.059
Now, I know what you're
thinking, literally.

24:35.060 --> 24:38.203
And yes, Pyro Ed is one of those people.

24:39.580 --> 24:44.273
You see, everybody works
for somebody, except me.

24:45.540 --> 24:46.630
I'm at the top

24:47.750 --> 24:50.113
and you've pissed in my Cheerios!

24:51.360 --> 24:52.493
- He's kind of a jerk.

24:53.390 --> 24:56.623
- Jay, something doesn't
feel right about this.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.433
- It's all right.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.429
- Do you really think you can hurt me?

25:03.430 --> 25:06.729
Jayden, the queen knighted
me, and not because

25:06.730 --> 25:08.204
she wanted to.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.049
- I don't think it matters.

25:11.050 --> 25:12.943
- So naive.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.819
I had hoped you would be
different, maybe even a challenge.

25:18.820 --> 25:20.289
But you're not.

25:20.290 --> 25:21.363
You're average.

25:22.350 --> 25:25.759
You're just like all
the others who have died

25:25.760 --> 25:28.667
merely for breathing in my direction.

25:33.718 --> 25:35.885
Let me show you something.

25:38.993 --> 25:40.973
Just like that, it could be over.

25:42.972 --> 25:45.743
I pull the trigger, you die,

25:46.890 --> 25:49.940
Mark tragically takes his own life

25:51.150 --> 25:54.169
while I rip this child to pieces.

25:54.170 --> 25:57.070
- If we work together we can
finish this before it starts!

27:00.688 --> 27:01.799
- Help!

27:01.800 --> 27:02.969
- Mark!

27:02.970 --> 27:03.802
Are you okay?

27:03.803 --> 27:05.409
What happened?

27:05.410 --> 27:06.276
- It's my leg.

27:06.277 --> 27:10.169
- Are Jay and Trevor both hurt too?

27:10.170 --> 27:12.249
- Trevor and Jay are dead.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.425
- No, you're lying.

27:13.426 --> 27:14.258
- Diane!

27:14.259 --> 27:15.091
- Get off me.

27:15.092 --> 27:15.924
You're lying.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.800
- Diane, get it together.

27:19.482 --> 27:23.902
- Sir Longbottom was more
powerful than we could imagine.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.149
I still don't wanna believe it,

27:25.150 --> 27:29.079
but we were insects compared to him.

27:29.080 --> 27:29.912
- That's enough.

27:29.913 --> 27:30.745
I know you've been through a lot,

27:30.746 --> 27:31.629
but there are children here.

27:31.630 --> 27:33.579
They don't need to hear this right now.

27:33.580 --> 27:34.830
- It's too late for that.

27:36.630 --> 27:37.703
- Trevor is dead?

27:42.090 --> 27:43.583
Why didn't you protect him?

27:44.441 --> 27:46.343
- It just, it happened so fast.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.659
We were completely overpowered.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.309
- We all need to take a minute and relax.

27:52.310 --> 27:55.489
Sir Longbottom is probably
gonna be on the move.

27:55.490 --> 27:57.859
We need to strike when
he least expects it.

27:57.860 --> 28:00.079
- If Mark, Trevor and
Boss couldn't stop him,

28:00.080 --> 28:02.289
then what chance do we have?

28:02.290 --> 28:04.449
- There has to be a way to outsmart him.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.763
- He has an IQ of over 155.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.079
Does anyone have an idea?

28:09.080 --> 28:09.912
- Kyle!

28:09.913 --> 28:11.319
Anyone?

28:11.320 --> 28:12.153
I'm serious.

28:13.919 --> 28:15.223
We're all gonna die.

28:22.895 --> 28:25.215
- How could he be gone, mom?

28:25.216 --> 28:27.136
Why would anyone ever do that?

28:27.137 --> 28:28.137
- It's okay.

28:29.038 --> 28:30.966
Some people are just bad.

28:30.967 --> 28:33.179
You try to change them and you can't.

28:33.180 --> 28:35.299
That's just the way they are.

28:35.300 --> 28:40.300
- What are we gonna do
now that Jay is, you know?

28:40.990 --> 28:42.419
Dead.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.373
- We're gonna call Harrison

28:43.374 --> 28:46.169
and then we're gonna
tell him what happened.

28:46.170 --> 28:47.963
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

28:49.150 --> 28:50.889
- Who the hell are you?

28:50.890 --> 28:51.809
- I'm Rosie.

28:51.810 --> 28:53.029
Sir Longbottom sent me.

28:53.030 --> 28:53.930
Oh, did he?

28:53.931 --> 28:54.763
Easy Diane.

28:54.764 --> 28:55.977
What do you want?

28:55.978 --> 28:57.739
- I just want my master to be happy

28:57.740 --> 29:00.090
and my master wants you
all out of the picture.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.319
Slow down, babe!

29:03.320 --> 29:06.259
Pyro Ed has this whole
place rigged to blow.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.389
If I press this button,

29:07.390 --> 29:09.749
it's gonna get really hot in here.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.178
Face it, who doesn't love a little heat?

29:31.710 --> 29:34.199
I'll be honest, Sir Longbottom
didn't actually tell me

29:34.200 --> 29:35.949
to kill you unless you got in my way.

29:35.950 --> 29:37.999
All he cares about is the shatter stick.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.969
- I'm not about to just give that away.

29:39.970 --> 29:42.696
- Of course not, but that's your warning.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.709
- Wait, what if the shatter stick

29:50.710 --> 29:52.259
is destroyed in the explosion?

29:52.260 --> 29:54.069
- Well then, can I have it?

29:54.070 --> 29:55.319
No, you can't.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.403
- That's a risk Sir
Longbottom is willing to take.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.149
- Was something supposed to happen?

30:04.150 --> 30:05.063
- Dammit Pyro!

30:33.846 --> 30:34.679
- Ah!

30:37.850 --> 30:39.873
I had wondered when you would wake.

30:41.243 --> 30:44.652
Your dreams, they were fascinating.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.853
It's all right.

30:49.840 --> 30:52.690
I didn't give you any injuries
that won't heal over time.

30:53.970 --> 30:55.423
Now to business.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.879
Although I had hoped for more,

30:58.880 --> 31:00.853
you seem like a bright enough fellow.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.317
I'm looking to build an
army and I need something.

31:07.610 --> 31:09.225
- I'm not gonna help you.

31:09.226 --> 31:10.476
- Shut up!

31:10.477 --> 31:13.883
Oh do remember, I can
control your every thought.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.173
- Okay.

31:26.330 --> 31:28.579
Okay I'll listen!

31:28.580 --> 31:30.343
- You'll do more than that.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.593
You're mine now.

31:37.780 --> 31:38.733
I own you.

31:40.710 --> 31:42.093
You work for me.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.843
- Yes, master.

31:47.290 --> 31:51.643
- As I was saying, I need something.

31:53.350 --> 31:55.849
For centuries, I've
watched people searching

31:55.850 --> 31:58.273
for a true leader and never finding one.

31:59.630 --> 32:02.393
It is my destiny to rule.

32:03.810 --> 32:06.619
And I will have vengeance upon this Earth

32:06.620 --> 32:08.363
and all those who oppose me.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.519
Those who know their place will help me

32:11.520 --> 32:13.633
to build a better tomorrow.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.133
- Yes, master.

32:19.260 --> 32:21.545
What do you need from me?

32:21.546 --> 32:22.722
- Spectrum!

32:35.076 --> 32:38.149
- We've never faced anything like this.

32:38.150 --> 32:40.239
- Now let's not panic.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.102
The minute we start to panic

32:41.103 --> 32:43.669
is when we might as well just give up.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.089
Harrison is right.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.229
- We still outnumber Sir Longbottom.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.649
- Sir, with all due respect he killed Jay

32:49.650 --> 32:51.093
without breaking a sweat.

32:52.110 --> 32:55.299
Don't forget this guy has mind powers.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.869
He can control people's thoughts
and the objects around him.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.419
We don't have anything
that can go up against

33:00.420 --> 33:01.473
something like that!

33:02.940 --> 33:04.269
- I think we need to plan an attack

33:04.270 --> 33:06.070
before the situation gets any worse.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.473
The more agents we can get
to help us, the better.

33:10.590 --> 33:12.139
- He'll know we're coming.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.129
- We could set a trap.

33:13.130 --> 33:15.219
- Sir Longbottom seems
like the kind of guy who

33:15.220 --> 33:18.220
doesn't do anything himself
unless he absolutely needs to.

33:19.410 --> 33:22.239
- I think a trap is a good place to start.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.329
At least it's an idea.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.339
The problem is...

33:25.340 --> 33:27.640
- The problem is it's
an idea that won't work!

33:29.260 --> 33:32.853
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but
I've seen this guy up close.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.013
- That's enough.

33:38.690 --> 33:41.139
Tomorrow, I will be
meeting with my assistants

33:41.140 --> 33:43.579
and the other leaders of the agency.

33:43.580 --> 33:47.223
I do think that what we do
next needs to happen soon.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.949
But I wanna hear it from them first.

33:50.950 --> 33:54.379
If they agree, then we can
agents from all over the country

33:54.380 --> 33:55.979
to help us.

33:55.980 --> 33:58.219
The last thing we need is for civilians

33:58.220 --> 34:02.359
to find out about this when
people like Sir Longbottom

34:02.360 --> 34:04.013
aren't supposed to exist.

34:05.030 --> 34:06.913
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.931
- Jay?

34:25.790 --> 34:27.853
- Such a shame.

34:29.980 --> 34:30.813
You're dying.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.073
How does it feel?

34:35.520 --> 34:38.032
- Why are you doing this?

34:38.033 --> 34:40.349
I thought you were dead.

34:40.350 --> 34:42.831
- The lord has saved me.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.714
Lord Longbottom.

34:48.911 --> 34:50.253
Just close your eyes.

35:10.801 --> 35:11.683
- Jay?

35:14.217 --> 35:15.343
You're okay!

35:16.730 --> 35:18.249
I thought you were dead.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.603
- No. I'm fine.

35:21.707 --> 35:22.757
- What are you doing?

35:26.050 --> 35:27.217
Something's different.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.893
- My master requires an item.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.483
And I'm taking it.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.349
- You're being controlled.

35:36.350 --> 35:37.248
- It feels good.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.573
Sir Longbottom is the gift to humanity!

35:45.039 --> 35:47.033
- Jay put the shatter stick down.

35:47.890 --> 35:49.190
You don't have to do this.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.562
Stop him!

36:57.707 --> 36:59.540
- What was that about?

37:02.556 --> 37:04.433
I thought you said Jay was dead?

37:05.840 --> 37:06.673
- Worse.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.420
Sir Longbottom is controlling him.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.180
- Did he try to kill you?

37:17.240 --> 37:18.073
- Yes.

37:20.237 --> 37:23.533
Without a mind of his own Jayden
just became very dangerous.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.232
Boss! Hackawackie!

38:31.441 --> 38:32.452
Boss!

38:35.722 --> 38:36.555
Boss?

38:37.420 --> 38:38.253
Anyone?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.220
You gotta be kidding me.

38:49.183 --> 38:50.353
It's disgusting.

38:53.170 --> 38:58.170
- Ah! Excellent work my new apprentice.

39:00.844 --> 39:02.403
I must admit,

39:04.560 --> 39:08.323
I didn't expect you to
complete this task so quickly.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.069
You are proving to be more
effective than the girl

39:13.070 --> 39:14.799
or the fire pig.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.200
Thank you master.

39:17.800 --> 39:22.229
- Now, I want you to use the shatter stick

39:22.230 --> 39:24.059
to go back in time,

39:24.060 --> 39:26.523
to before Doctor Collin Fantom was killed.

39:27.530 --> 39:30.519
Only then will you be
able to find Spectrum

39:30.520 --> 39:34.143
before the genetic code was
altered into the Fantom Disease.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.632
Understood.

39:36.633 --> 39:39.733
- Once there, you must move quickly.

39:43.750 --> 39:47.743
Show me the one's who want to destroy me!

39:52.720 --> 39:54.670
Your friends can prepare all they want.

39:56.008 --> 39:57.233
It makes no difference.

39:58.960 --> 40:03.960
I think I'll crush their
bones into a fine powder.

40:09.820 --> 40:10.883
Go. Now!

40:14.950 --> 40:15.859
- There's a mountain nearby

40:15.860 --> 40:17.729
with really high chemical readings.

40:17.730 --> 40:20.079
At first I didn't think much about it.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.519
Then satellite images showed Jay

40:21.520 --> 40:23.353
coming around this side of the mountain.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.999
- Maybe Sir Longbottom has a
secret hideout or something?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.939
- There's only one way to find out.

40:29.940 --> 40:31.206
- You wanna go there?

40:31.207 --> 40:32.783
- It's a good place to start.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.489
We don't know what Sir
Longbottom is planning,

40:35.490 --> 40:37.759
but now he has the shatter stick.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.546
- With the scanners picking
up these readings, if your

40:40.547 --> 40:44.379
right, I'd say he's building weapons.

40:44.380 --> 40:45.930
- Exactly why we need to hurry.

40:47.630 --> 40:49.259
- I have a suggestion.

40:49.260 --> 40:50.203
Two words.

40:51.660 --> 40:52.973
Nitro Canon.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.050
- Oh, I like this kid!

41:25.040 --> 41:25.873
- Jayden!

41:28.970 --> 41:30.859
What are you doing here?

41:30.860 --> 41:31.760
- We need to talk.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.660
- You don't look like my Jayden.

41:38.540 --> 41:42.203
You look older?

41:46.850 --> 41:50.853
Actually, you look like shit.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.279
How are you doing, buddy?

41:54.280 --> 41:56.260
- Nothing gets past you.

41:56.261 --> 41:58.070
I am from the future.

41:59.180 --> 42:04.180
In my timeline, Sir Longbottom
is controlling my mind

42:06.192 --> 42:08.507
and attempting to take over the world.

42:09.545 --> 42:10.628
- Longbottom.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.130
He always did have big dreams, didn't he?

42:18.890 --> 42:20.869
Spent the last few years
hiding in the shadows

42:20.870 --> 42:24.653
and finally the Brit
decides to show himself.

42:25.750 --> 42:29.889
- The sad thing is, I think he's been

42:29.890 --> 42:32.490
working on his evil plan
since before this timeline,

42:34.770 --> 42:39.770
and he sent me back in time
to steal Spectrum from you.

42:41.376 --> 42:42.926
He sent you,

42:47.209 --> 42:52.165
Jayden am I dead where you're from?

42:56.100 --> 42:57.350
I'm afraid so.

42:58.690 --> 42:59.640
Damn.

43:00.770 --> 43:03.989
Look, I haven't
always been a good friend.

43:03.990 --> 43:05.731
I've lied to you

43:05.732 --> 43:08.930
and in only a few months
you're gonna lose everything

43:10.070 --> 43:11.762
because of me.

43:11.763 --> 43:15.009
I do not
like the sound of this.

43:15.010 --> 43:16.753
I know now.

43:16.754 --> 43:20.483
That what I did or will do, it's wrong.

43:23.010 --> 43:25.649
I don't wanna die, Jayden.

43:25.650 --> 43:27.239
I don't deserve to die!

43:27.240 --> 43:28.799
We all have that fate.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.653
We all have to face that day.

43:32.220 --> 43:34.709
We've been through a lot together.

43:34.710 --> 43:37.639
I can't stop Sir Longbottom alone.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.629
- Why don't you just get
Mark or Diane to help you?

43:40.630 --> 43:45.630
- Because I came here to tell you,

43:47.184 --> 43:48.609
that I'm sorry.

43:51.390 --> 43:52.223
- Damn you.

43:55.425 --> 43:57.199
You know what the funny thing is Jayden,

43:57.200 --> 44:00.467
I can't even be mad at you.

44:03.906 --> 44:05.213
I guess I will later, but.

44:09.409 --> 44:10.833
We've always been brothers.

44:15.349 --> 44:19.349
I see you're still
wearing that stupid hat.

44:19.350 --> 44:20.233
- Everyday.

44:21.130 --> 44:25.713
- You know, I don't even
remember why I gave that to you.

44:26.710 --> 44:27.543
I do.

44:28.490 --> 44:29.523
That's what matters.

44:32.420 --> 44:36.529
- Fine, how can I help you with all this?

44:36.530 --> 44:38.620
I need you
to give Diane a message.

44:38.621 --> 44:39.739
- Okay.

44:39.740 --> 44:42.129
- I think that if we go back in time

44:42.130 --> 44:45.259
before Sir Longbotton drinks
from the fountain of youth,

44:45.260 --> 44:46.919
that we can kill him.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.579
- Isn't that how he got his powers?

44:48.580 --> 44:50.059
Supposedly?

44:50.060 --> 44:52.459
A side effect
from the fountain?

44:52.460 --> 44:53.982
Yes.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.809
- Why not just go back and kill him now?

44:55.810 --> 44:58.009
- I have to go back to the future first.

44:58.010 --> 44:58.842
'Cause if I kill him now,

44:58.843 --> 45:01.369
then he never would have
sent me on this mission.

45:01.370 --> 45:04.059
- You'll be stuck in an endless loop.

45:04.060 --> 45:05.110
- Tell Diane to wait.

45:06.050 --> 45:08.523
Tell her to wait until
she can't wait any longer.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.969
This needs to be a last resort

45:10.970 --> 45:13.720
because there's 400 years of
time we're tampering with.

45:14.750 --> 45:17.743
Imagine what would happen
with just that one change.

45:19.261 --> 45:21.237
- Okay, I'll tell her.

45:23.059 --> 45:25.689
Is there anything else you'd like?

45:25.690 --> 45:27.409
- Remember that memory gum?

45:27.410 --> 45:28.242
Yeah.

45:28.243 --> 45:29.289
- That you designed?

45:29.290 --> 45:30.123
- What about it?

45:31.770 --> 45:33.023
- I'm gonna need that.

45:34.670 --> 45:35.502
- Why?

45:35.503 --> 45:36.639
Because when I get back,

45:36.640 --> 45:38.719
Sir Longbottom's gonna
control my mind again

45:38.720 --> 45:40.570
and we can't let him know about this plan.

45:42.900 --> 45:43.733
- Makes sense.

45:50.740 --> 45:55.740
Now remember, you better take it now.

45:57.460 --> 46:00.927
It only erases the last
10 minutes of your memory.

46:06.146 --> 46:07.813
- Thank you, Collin.

46:10.794 --> 46:12.211
- Good luck, buddy.

47:06.800 --> 47:07.633
- Hello.

47:08.470 --> 47:10.169
- I recognize you!

47:10.170 --> 47:11.579
- I've never seen you before.

47:11.580 --> 47:14.319
- You were that cutie with
Jayden and the other man.

47:14.320 --> 47:17.289
You foolishly tried to
defeat the dark lord!

47:17.290 --> 47:18.579
- How do you know that?

47:18.580 --> 47:20.699
- My mind is connected to Sir Longbottom.

47:20.700 --> 47:22.499
Everything he sees I see.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.149
What I feel, he feels.

47:24.150 --> 47:25.799
Pain or pleasure.

47:25.800 --> 47:28.339
He'll be very pleased
when I bring you to him.

47:28.340 --> 47:29.674
- That's not gonna happen.

47:29.675 --> 47:32.109
- The dark lord has eyes everywhere.

47:32.110 --> 47:34.499
If I fail, someone will take my place.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.129
You can't even trust your friends.

47:36.130 --> 47:37.485
- The dark lord, what is he Voldemort?

47:37.486 --> 47:39.439
Wait! What did you say?

47:39.440 --> 47:40.489
- Come with me kid.

47:40.490 --> 47:41.609
No one can save you.

47:41.610 --> 47:42.710
- What did he do?

47:53.960 --> 47:56.959
- Now, tell me where he is.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.813
- I'm not telling you anything.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.569
- Where is he?

48:02.570 --> 48:03.433
- Go to hell.

48:05.107 --> 48:05.939
- Okay.

48:05.940 --> 48:10.219
Okay. He keeps his weapons
in a cave just south of here.

48:10.220 --> 48:13.159
Follow this trail and you'll
come to an abandoned shed.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.243
Sometimes he works on new weapons there.

48:16.230 --> 48:18.417
He knows you're coming.

48:18.418 --> 48:19.640
You're dead.

48:34.330 --> 48:36.246
- What happened?

48:36.247 --> 48:37.893
- I don't know, master.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.883
I don't remember.

48:42.010 --> 48:43.883
- Did I lose control of you?

48:46.200 --> 48:48.250
I'm having trouble reading your thoughts.

48:49.190 --> 48:50.523
This concerns me.

48:52.570 --> 48:57.570
Let's go back, but this
time we'll do it together.

48:57.670 --> 49:00.943
Wait, I'm sensing something.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.150
Show me the other side of the mountain.

49:15.430 --> 49:17.919
Prepare yourself, my apprentice.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.093
We have guests!

49:40.490 --> 49:43.513
So glad you didn't just give up.

49:44.530 --> 49:48.639
You know, when I killed
those other agents,

49:48.640 --> 49:51.033
they begged for their lives.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.609
Not you though.

49:53.610 --> 49:55.313
You ran away!

49:56.870 --> 49:58.020
- We all have off days.

49:59.290 --> 50:00.123
- Coward!

50:01.640 --> 50:04.039
- Now you're just making me mad.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.453
Kyle, you're up.

50:23.730 --> 50:24.563
- Marvelous!

50:26.949 --> 50:29.349
- That was enough power
to blow up a small town.

50:30.410 --> 50:31.513
- This is bad.

50:33.412 --> 50:34.936
- Is that it?

50:34.937 --> 50:36.563
Is that all you've got?

51:31.167 --> 51:32.000
- Trevor!

51:38.183 --> 51:39.940
- Jay, please.

52:09.229 --> 52:11.396
- You should be proud boy.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.939
I can see the fire in your eyes.

52:16.940 --> 52:19.323
Burning! Growing!

52:20.850 --> 52:24.993
But you've still got a lot
to learn about true power.

52:39.961 --> 52:41.809
- What? Where am I?

52:41.810 --> 52:42.642
Jay?

52:42.643 --> 52:43.475
- What's going on?

52:43.476 --> 52:44.308
- It's time.

52:44.309 --> 52:45.230
What are you talking about?

52:45.231 --> 52:46.063
What happened to you?

52:46.064 --> 52:47.369
- Doesn't matter.

52:47.370 --> 52:48.519
- Years ago Collin came to me

52:48.520 --> 52:50.009
and said that you had
showed up with a plan

52:50.010 --> 52:51.739
to stop Sir Longbottom.

52:51.740 --> 52:52.929
- I did?

52:52.930 --> 52:54.399
You said that if
we travel to the past to

52:54.400 --> 52:55.759
before he drinks from the fountain

52:55.760 --> 52:57.389
then we may be able to kill him.

52:57.390 --> 52:58.699
I wanted to say something all this time.

52:58.700 --> 53:01.419
We could have avoided all
the pain and death he caused,

53:01.420 --> 53:02.252
but...

53:02.253 --> 53:03.297
- But what?

53:03.298 --> 53:05.659
- But you also said it
had to be a last resort.

53:05.660 --> 53:08.059
If we do this we're gonna
change 400 years of history.

53:08.060 --> 53:09.660
We don't know what could happen.

53:10.870 --> 53:11.889
- I said all of this?

53:11.890 --> 53:13.690
Yes, and then
had your memory wiped.

53:16.240 --> 53:19.313
- If we're here then
you had no other choice.

54:09.640 --> 54:10.683
- What is this?

54:11.760 --> 54:12.879
Where are the others?

54:12.880 --> 54:14.023
- Don't worry about them.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.789
Jay.

54:20.790 --> 54:22.993
- Whoever you are, you're not good enough.

54:39.430 --> 54:40.263
- No, no, no.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.810
This wasn't supposed to happen.

54:45.210 --> 54:46.539
We're gonna get help, okay?

54:46.540 --> 54:47.889
We're gonna get help.

54:47.890 --> 54:49.290
There's not enough time.

54:51.778 --> 54:53.246
Just look at me.

54:53.247 --> 54:56.164
- No, don't say that, okay?

54:56.165 --> 54:58.115
I'm not ready to say goodbye, please.

54:59.080 --> 55:01.497
Don't say goodbye.

55:02.390 --> 55:03.807
I love you Diane.

55:06.185 --> 55:07.889
- Please stay with me.

55:07.890 --> 55:10.409
Stay with me, Jay.

55:10.410 --> 55:11.243
Jay, Jay.

55:22.272 --> 55:23.189
You did it.

55:24.765 --> 55:25.973
It cost you everything.

55:28.310 --> 55:30.489
What am I supposed to tell everyone?

55:30.490 --> 55:32.740
What about Lindsey, you
didn't even tell her.

55:34.170 --> 55:35.713
It's not fair, Jay.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.543
I'm gonna fix this, promise.

56:28.780 --> 56:30.379
- Diane, what happened?

56:30.380 --> 56:31.680
Come inside, are you okay?

56:36.682 --> 56:38.029
- No.

56:38.030 --> 56:40.899
Can Jay and I have some privacy please?

56:40.900 --> 56:42.829
- Oh, uh yeah.

56:42.830 --> 56:43.663
Don't mind me.

56:46.130 --> 56:47.136
What is it?

56:48.470 --> 56:49.889
- It's just really nice to see you.

56:49.890 --> 56:53.209
- Wait, there's something
different about you.

56:53.210 --> 56:54.939
- Look, before things get more complicated

56:54.940 --> 56:56.729
I have to give you something.

56:56.730 --> 56:58.689
Do you remember working
on the shatter stick?

56:58.690 --> 57:00.489
- Um. Yeah.

57:00.490 --> 57:01.539
- But Harrison and the scientists

57:01.540 --> 57:03.029
they said it had to remain classified

57:03.030 --> 57:04.119
so you never got to use it?

57:04.120 --> 57:06.299
- Where are you going with this?

57:06.300 --> 57:07.489
You stole it?

57:07.490 --> 57:08.669
- Not exactly.

57:08.670 --> 57:09.959
- Harrison is gonna fire you!

57:09.960 --> 57:11.599
- Leave Harrison to me.

57:11.600 --> 57:16.600
But listen, your life is
going to be cut short.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.139
And I know that you don't wanna hear that

57:20.140 --> 57:22.140
and I shouldn't even be telling you, but

57:23.760 --> 57:25.210
promise you'll come visit me.

57:26.410 --> 57:28.909
Because I need you in my life.

57:28.910 --> 57:31.461
And we still have time
to be together here.

57:31.462 --> 57:33.749
But where I'm from,

57:33.750 --> 57:34.629
promise me!

57:34.630 --> 57:35.462
- Oh. Of course.

57:35.463 --> 57:36.296
Yeah!

57:38.380 --> 57:39.213
- I have to go.

57:41.930 --> 57:44.743
I love you so much.

57:51.650 --> 57:52.700
- What just happened?

57:59.630 --> 58:01.719
Was she from the future?

58:01.720 --> 58:05.945
- Yes, she was.

58:05.946 --> 58:06.996
- Is everything okay?

58:08.080 --> 58:09.188
- I don't think so,

58:10.797 --> 58:12.703
but I don't think I'm
supposed to say anything.

58:15.250 --> 58:16.300
- If you're sure Jay.

58:17.965 --> 58:21.440
- More than ever, I feel lost.

58:25.060 --> 58:26.803
- Well I'm gonna change the topic.

58:27.640 --> 58:28.472
While you two were talking

58:28.473 --> 58:30.160
I got an interesting notification.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.639
Remember the guy that Harrison listed

58:33.640 --> 58:36.053
as the agency's number
one most wanted criminal?

58:37.020 --> 58:38.859
The Viper Sniper?

58:38.860 --> 58:40.409
- Well yeah.

58:40.410 --> 58:41.493
What about him?

58:42.898 --> 58:44.619
- Turns out a few agents
actually got some background

58:44.620 --> 58:45.479
on the guy.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.709
- All we knew before is
that he could shoot a gun.

58:48.710 --> 58:51.039
- With ridiculous aim!

58:51.040 --> 58:53.303
Seriously! This is good stuff.

58:55.260 --> 58:57.699
He joined the military when he was 18,

58:57.700 --> 58:59.743
he got married, he had a son.

59:01.150 --> 59:03.943
And he left his family when
his son was only three.

59:04.790 --> 59:05.979
- What happened to the wife?

59:05.980 --> 59:09.173
- No idea until now.

59:10.840 --> 59:14.853
Turns out she passed and
left the kid on the streets.

59:16.090 --> 59:16.973
- That's too bad.

59:19.950 --> 59:22.133
I know how hard it is
to grow up like that.

59:23.210 --> 59:24.619
I wonder if he ever made it.

59:24.620 --> 59:25.740
We have everything.

59:27.070 --> 59:28.889
Social security number,

59:28.890 --> 59:31.673
previous addresses, bank records,

59:32.720 --> 59:33.779
we even have a name.

59:33.780 --> 59:34.613
Oh yeah?

59:35.710 --> 59:37.760
So, what is the Viper Sniper's real name?

59:38.850 --> 59:40.253
- Jessie Doyle.

59:47.550 --> 59:48.383
- Collin?

59:49.360 --> 59:50.192
Is that you?

59:50.193 --> 59:54.143
- Diane, you look terrible.

59:55.910 --> 59:57.819
Is everything all right?

59:57.820 --> 59:59.083
I've had quite a day.

1:00:00.110 --> 1:00:04.905
But how are you, why are you...

1:00:04.906 --> 1:00:05.739
- Here?

1:00:07.779 --> 1:00:09.129
You look a little confused.

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:15.409
I can only assume that you and Jay

1:00:15.410 --> 1:00:17.509
paid Sir Longbottom a visit.

1:00:17.510 --> 1:00:18.989
Am I right?

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:19.823
- Sir who?

1:00:21.670 --> 1:00:24.039
What are you guys talking about?

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:25.090
- Jay didn't make it.

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:27.033
- What?

1:00:28.270 --> 1:00:29.703
That's terrible news.

1:00:34.330 --> 1:00:37.253
I'm so sorry, Diane.

1:00:39.230 --> 1:00:40.063
- It's okay.

1:00:41.056 --> 1:00:43.156
I have a feeling we'll see him again soon.

1:00:45.340 --> 1:00:46.540
But how are things here?

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:49.569
- Sad now, thanks.

1:00:49.570 --> 1:00:52.229
Just found out my best friend is dead!

1:00:52.230 --> 1:00:54.973
- A toast, to Jay!

1:00:58.361 --> 1:01:01.500
A man who brought out the
best in everyone around him.

1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:06.519
He was so full of love, it spilled over

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:08.949
and gave the rest of us a boost.

1:01:08.950 --> 1:01:09.783
- Here, here!

1:01:11.950 --> 1:01:16.950
- And lastly, a man that was
willing to give it all up,

1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:20.373
so that we, I,

1:01:27.490 --> 1:01:28.840
could have a second chance.

1:01:31.594 --> 1:01:33.837
To Jay, one of the greats!

1:01:48.773 --> 1:01:51.609
He was always
getting me in trouble.

1:01:51.610 --> 1:01:54.539
I remember my
first day at The Academy.

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:56.647
He ran straight into me.

1:01:59.513 --> 1:02:02.297
I remember one time
I tried to touch Jay's hat,

1:02:02.298 --> 1:02:03.847
he pulled a gun on me.

1:02:06.758 --> 1:02:08.424
Don't touch the hat!

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.519
Good evening, Boss.

1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:21.879
- Boss?

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:24.353
- Yeah that's what
Pocketman said to call you.

1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.002
You're in charge now, right?

1:02:27.003 --> 1:02:28.461
- I was always in charge.

1:03:25.870 --> 1:03:26.702
- Stop!

1:03:26.703 --> 1:03:27.853
I'm trying to study here.

1:03:31.669 --> 1:03:32.502
Trevor!

1:03:38.313 --> 1:03:39.145
- Ow!

1:03:39.146 --> 1:03:39.989
What was that for?

1:03:39.990 --> 1:03:41.323
- How do you like it?

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.759
- I thought we were studying.

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:47.773
- Can't hurt to take a quick break.

1:03:47.774 --> 1:03:49.274
Trevor!

1:05:08.290 --> 1:05:09.719
Just stay back, sweetie.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:12.176
It's been too long.

1:05:12.177 --> 1:05:13.739
How long has it been?

1:05:13.740 --> 1:05:14.742
Like two weeks.

1:05:14.743 --> 1:05:17.239
See, like I said!

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.250
Check out my new fire pack.

1:05:33.027 --> 1:05:34.744
Now it's a party.

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:53.679
Cool, huh?

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:56.404
I've been working on this bad boy for...

1:05:56.405 --> 1:05:57.979
What do you want?

1:05:57.980 --> 1:05:59.140
Look what's that?

1:05:59.663 --> 1:06:00.744
Burn!

1:06:19.503 --> 1:06:21.626
That's not fair.

1:06:23.928 --> 1:06:25.678
What are we
gonna do with this guy?

1:06:27.899 --> 1:06:29.559
Let's tie him up
and put him in the garage.

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:31.643
That's what Jay would do.

1:07:09.530 --> 1:07:10.362
We're going for a walk

1:07:10.363 --> 1:07:12.406
did you wanna come with us?

1:07:12.407 --> 1:07:13.789
- No, it's late.

1:07:13.790 --> 1:07:14.839
I was gonna head home soon.

1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:16.419
- Are you sure?

1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:17.252
- Come on.

1:07:17.253 --> 1:07:19.329
I'm gonna explain functions
of a complex variable

1:07:19.330 --> 1:07:21.669
and bilinear transformation.

1:07:21.670 --> 1:07:22.699
I'm excited!

1:07:22.700 --> 1:07:24.159
- I think I'll pass.

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:25.010
You two have fun.

1:07:59.861 --> 1:08:01.709
- Oh geez, you startled me.

1:08:01.710 --> 1:08:02.953
- I'm sorry.

1:08:04.380 --> 1:08:05.939
I didn't think anyone was awake.

1:08:05.940 --> 1:08:07.829
- Is everything okay?

1:08:07.830 --> 1:08:09.209
- Of course.

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:10.133
Now off to bed.

1:08:23.660 --> 1:08:25.297
- Shit!

1:08:25.298 --> 1:08:26.363
I have to do this tonight.

1:08:26.364 --> 1:08:27.774
Where is he?

1:08:27.775 --> 1:08:28.607
- Have to do what Freddie?

1:08:28.608 --> 1:08:29.630
Who are you talking to?

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:36.293
- What's going on out here?

1:08:40.090 --> 1:08:41.290
What are you doing Fred?

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.162
- It's finally time for
a change around here.

1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:50.281
Glorious!

1:08:51.210 --> 1:08:52.513
Long live the Viper.
