<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:34.884 --> 00:37.717
It's a solid grill,
and at this price...

00:37.754 --> 00:40.245
Hey! I've been standing
here for 45 minutes!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.087
Ma'am, I'm the only one
on the floor today,

00:42.125 --> 00:43.786
so if you could just bear
with me, I...

00:43.827 --> 00:45.852
Mr. McKenna's delivery
never came.

00:47.063 --> 00:49.531
Mr. McKenna, we're
a little short-handed...

00:49.566 --> 00:54.196
Yeah, I understand you can't
grill an excuse, sir, but I...

00:54.237 --> 00:55.568
Well, sir, I disagree.

00:55.605 --> 00:57.869
I don't think a monkey
could do my job.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.239
Hank!

01:05.281 --> 01:06.908
Oh, Hank, I am so excited.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.884
I just joined
the planning committee

01:08.918 --> 01:12.081
for the first annual
Viva Los Arlentinos Day.

01:13.289 --> 01:14.813
Well, I'm glad you had
a good day.

01:14.858 --> 01:17.952
Mine's been just about
the worst one I can remember.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.985
We had no one
on the sales floor...

01:20.029 --> 01:21.155
It is a festival

01:21.197 --> 01:24.223
celebrating Arlen's rich
Hispanic heritage.

01:24.267 --> 01:25.859
And get this, Hank:

01:25.902 --> 01:28.302
There will be an
actual bull run!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.306
Isn't that amazing?!

01:31.341 --> 01:32.501
It could mean a lot

01:32.542 --> 01:33.942
of substitute
Spanish teaching gigs.

01:33.943 --> 01:36.468
Hank, I want you to join
the committee and help out.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.480
What do you say?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.744
Peggy, I'm exhausted.

01:39.783 --> 01:43.241
I don't have time for some
harebrained bull run.

01:43.286 --> 01:45.880
Well, then, I guess
I won't have time

01:45.922 --> 01:47.685
to prepare
your dinner tonight.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.029
Hill, why aren't you
in the shower?

02:01.070 --> 02:04.471
Uh, well, you know how I am
in gym class.

02:04.507 --> 02:05.769
I barely move.

02:05.809 --> 02:08.003
Why shower if I don't sweat?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.102
Ah, nice try.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.806
That'll get you
an "A" in debate,

02:10.847 --> 02:11.939
but an "F" in gym.

02:11.981 --> 02:12.948
Now, shower!

02:15.685 --> 02:18.279
I always wanted to run
with the bulls.

02:18.321 --> 02:20.789
Sometimes when I'm
being chased by dogs,

02:20.824 --> 02:22.223
I pretend they're bulls.

02:22.258 --> 02:24.317
Geez, Bill, why run
with the bulls?

02:24.360 --> 02:26.294
At your weight
and cholesterol count,

02:26.329 --> 02:27.626
if you want to hasten death,

02:27.664 --> 02:29.996
just jump up and down
a couple of times.

02:30.033 --> 02:32.263
No, I want the bulls to do it.

02:32.302 --> 02:33.564
Guys, I'm too tired

02:33.603 --> 02:36.094
to hear a bunch of nonsense
right now.

02:36.139 --> 02:38.004
Bull runs are stupid.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.770
They tried one
in Mesquite last year.

02:39.809 --> 02:42.607
The bulls kept stopping
to eat grass off the sidewalk.

02:42.645 --> 02:44.203
Things have changed, Hank.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.010
Mesquite was a wake-up call.

02:46.049 --> 02:48.210
Now they're pumping the bulls
with testosterone,

02:48.251 --> 02:51.448
a bona fide magic elixir
of power.

02:51.487 --> 02:53.978
It makes a creature
bigger, faster,

02:54.023 --> 02:55.786
meaner, and smarter.

02:55.825 --> 02:57.292
Like Vin Diesel.

02:57.327 --> 02:59.557
Exactly like Vin Diesel.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.928
Our folks are gonna
get trampled and gored

03:01.965 --> 03:03.899
in a way those wussies
in Mesquite

03:03.933 --> 03:04.900
could only dream of!

03:04.934 --> 03:06.162
Hey, Bobby.

03:06.202 --> 03:07.396
Hey, Dad.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.962
I'm supposed to ask
you to sign this.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.570
You're flunking P. E?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.634
Well, how is that
even possible?

03:14.677 --> 03:17.976
Uh, well, I guess I'm just
smaller than the other guys.

03:18.014 --> 03:19.777
I can't keep up.

03:19.816 --> 03:22.979
Son, P.E. Isn't
about being strong or fast

03:23.019 --> 03:24.418
or winning points.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.217
That stuff only matters in...

03:26.256 --> 03:28.850
well, every single
other area of life.

03:28.892 --> 03:31.156
But in P.E., all you
have to do is try.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.596
Okay, I'll try.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.225
The boy's got no fight in him.

03:38.268 --> 03:39.599
I don't get it.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.833
He spends five hours a day
playing violent video games.

03:42.872 --> 03:46.603
What's the point if they don't have
any effect on him?

03:46.643 --> 03:50.272
Maybe he's missing something.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.405
Like testosterone!

03:51.447 --> 03:52.471
Dale...

03:52.515 --> 03:54.642
It's the perfect explanation.

03:54.684 --> 03:59.917
Testosterone provides
everything Bobby's missing: Energy,

03:59.956 --> 04:04.359
confidence, aggression,
agility, muscle, speed.

04:04.394 --> 04:06.294
Just give him a little
extra to top him off,

04:06.329 --> 04:08.559
and sha-sha:
Instant puberty.

04:08.598 --> 04:10.691
I don't know.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.998
Now, Joseph...
he's bursting with testosterone.

04:14.037 --> 04:17.063
Hey, Joseph, wanna wrestle?

04:18.308 --> 04:20.242
Oh, God, it hurts!

04:20.276 --> 04:22.471
It hurts so much!

04:22.512 --> 04:24.446
Huh.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.217
Bobby doesn't need
testosterone.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.449
He needs
his father's acceptance.

04:33.489 --> 04:36.185
If only his glands
could secrete that.

04:36.225 --> 04:38.386
Peggy, we're just taking
a growing boy to a doctor.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.662
There's nothing wrong
with finding out if...

04:41.698 --> 04:42.926
Hello?

04:42.966 --> 04:44.627
What?!

04:44.667 --> 04:46.532
I'll be there as
soon as possible.

04:46.569 --> 04:47.763
Donna's out sick.

04:47.804 --> 04:49.795
Now I've gotta do
all the bookkeeping

04:49.839 --> 04:52.933
while I'm doing Joe Jack's
and Enrique's jobs.

04:52.976 --> 04:54.466
Dang it, dang it!

04:54.510 --> 04:56.842
All the more reason this visit
is a waste of time, Hank.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.937
We should just...

04:57.981 --> 05:00.506
Peggy, just drop it, okay?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.417
Well, except for being
incurably ticklish,

05:03.453 --> 05:05.387
I'm a hundred percent healthy!

05:05.421 --> 05:07.048
Bobby, good work!

05:07.090 --> 05:08.819
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

05:08.858 --> 05:10.723
it turns out
what I gave in the sample cup

05:10.760 --> 05:13.786
was only half the story.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.092
So you couldn't find anything

05:15.131 --> 05:16.428
wrong with him, Doctor?

05:16.466 --> 05:17.626
Nope.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.998
He's developing
at a perfectly normal rate.

05:19.035 --> 05:20.900
Uh-huh. But shouldn't
we be giving him

05:20.937 --> 05:23.030
maybe just a little
testosterone,

05:23.072 --> 05:24.266
just to top him off?

05:24.307 --> 05:26.104
You know,
jump-start that puberty?

05:26.142 --> 05:29.942
Yes, Mr. Hill, testosterone
can "jump-start' puberty,

05:29.979 --> 05:31.776
but I don't give
radical hormone therapy

05:31.814 --> 05:34.783
to young boys who happen to be
mediocre at dodge ball.

05:34.817 --> 05:37.081
Testosterone is
most commonly prescribed

05:37.120 --> 05:40.385
to men in their 40s
with Irritable Male Syndrome.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.481
Irritable what who?

05:41.524 --> 05:43.992
Irritable Male Syndrome, or IMS.

05:44.027 --> 05:45.824
It's the male equivalent
of PMS.

05:45.862 --> 05:47.727
There's a PMS for men?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.254
Oh, God.

05:49.298 --> 05:51.493
Look, we don't have
time to talk politics.

05:51.534 --> 05:53.058
I've gotta get to work.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.662
Men's testosterone levels fluctuate
wildly throughout each day.

05:55.705 --> 05:59.232
In some men, it can cause
lethargy, anxiety, irritability.

06:01.811 --> 06:03.745
You have
Irritable Male Syndrome!

06:03.780 --> 06:04.678
What?!

06:04.714 --> 06:06.079
This is why you didn't want

06:06.115 --> 06:08.276
to help me
with Viva Los Arlentinos Day.

06:08.317 --> 06:11.047
This is why you've been grouchy
and sluggish and...

06:11.087 --> 06:12.987
Dang it, Peggy,
that's ridiculous!

06:13.022 --> 06:15.286
I'm just stressed
about my work.

06:15.324 --> 06:17.019
Well, the stress
you're feeling at work

06:17.060 --> 06:18.857
could be a result of IMS.

06:18.895 --> 06:20.260
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.176
Just think of it like
you're having your menses.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.564
Hank, I'm going to write you

06:24.600 --> 06:27.728
a prescription for a low-dosage
testosterone supplement.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.499
Go ahead and try it for a few...

06:29.539 --> 06:30.972
I don't need testosterone.

06:31.007 --> 06:33.601
I just need you two
to get off my got-dang back.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.837
Let's go, Bobby.

06:34.877 --> 06:37.573
We're done
with this jackass festival.

06:39.749 --> 06:41.979
Testosterone could've
elevated Hank's mood,

06:42.018 --> 06:43.485
improved his whole outlook.

06:47.090 --> 06:49.615
Well, I should probably, uh,

06:49.659 --> 06:53.288
turn my back and file
a chart or something.

07:12.448 --> 07:13.472
Got-dang it!

07:13.516 --> 07:14.915
I'm out of clean socks!

07:14.951 --> 07:16.213
Got-dang it!

07:19.322 --> 07:21.483
Breakfast is ready!

07:26.729 --> 07:28.424
Well, Bobby, I've
scheduled a conference

07:28.464 --> 07:30.762
with your P.E. Teacher so
we can discuss the problem.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.960
Oh, my God, Dad!

07:32.001 --> 07:33.468
Don't do that!

07:33.503 --> 07:35.801
I... I forbid it!

07:35.838 --> 07:38.033
Dang it.
What is going on with you?!

07:38.074 --> 07:40.338
Don't forget
about your coffee, Hank.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.106
Okay, the real reason
I'm failing P.E. Is...

07:43.146 --> 07:45.808
I won't take a shower
with the other guys!

07:45.848 --> 07:47.110
I can't!

07:47.150 --> 07:48.981
Bobby, do not lay this trip
on your father

07:49.018 --> 07:50.952
while he's trying to enjoy
his coffee.

07:50.987 --> 07:53.319
He's stressed enough
without you interrupting

07:53.356 --> 07:54.755
his coffee-drinking time.

07:54.790 --> 07:57.953
All right, Hank, you're free
to drink your coffee.

07:57.994 --> 08:00.121
Would you forget
about the coffee?

08:00.163 --> 08:03.132
Bobby, no one wants to
take a shower after gym.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.225
It's not fun,
it's not pleasant,

08:05.268 --> 08:07.168
and usually not very sanitary,

08:07.203 --> 08:08.602
but you do it anyway.

08:08.638 --> 08:09.935
Why?

08:09.972 --> 08:11.803
Because a big part
of being a man

08:11.841 --> 08:13.934
is doing things you
don't want to do.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.274
But there's a way
to get through it:

08:16.312 --> 08:20.009
You just lower your eyes to the
floor and count the tiles.

08:20.049 --> 08:21.607
In my day, there were 60.

08:21.651 --> 08:24.119
Count the tiles.

08:24.153 --> 08:26.348
I'll do it.

08:26.389 --> 08:28.448
Well, I guess I'm off, too.

08:28.491 --> 08:29.788
Wait, Hank!

08:29.825 --> 08:31.383
Don't forget your coffee.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.419
Yeah, I'm gonna need it
for the day I'm facing.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.797
And I made you
some more for later.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.893
Drink it six hours from now,
with a meal.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.268
Do not mix it with alcohol.

08:45.908 --> 08:49.503
Hey, dude, is that a pimple
or another nipple?

08:50.846 --> 08:52.780
I'll take that "F."

09:05.561 --> 09:07.825
Ta-da!

09:07.863 --> 09:08.989
I'll take it.

09:09.031 --> 09:10.965
You said you were
helping me next.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.490
Does that look like me?

09:12.535 --> 09:16.062
Ma'am, I am going to do whatever
it takes to make you happy.

09:16.105 --> 09:17.766
Here's the 20-second tour
of the store.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.434
Are you gettin' happy?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.971
A little...

09:24.046 --> 09:25.775
Yep.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.782
Mm-hmm.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.783
Y...

09:27.817 --> 09:29.944
Got-dang right!

09:29.986 --> 09:33.513
So it turns out, I am not
the actual Dale Gribble

09:33.556 --> 09:34.921
but a clone of him.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.788
The original me
is a super-warrior

09:36.826 --> 09:39.294
from the year 2087.

09:39.328 --> 09:43.424
The second me, i.e., "I"
was created to help the first me

09:43.466 --> 09:45.798
fight the invading
Mongol armies.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.496
Beer, please.

09:47.536 --> 09:50.801
Dale, that's asinine,
and here's four reasons why:

09:50.840 --> 09:53.104
First: You're not gonna clone
a super-warrior

09:53.142 --> 09:56.009
out of a guy who can't even win
a thumb-wrestling match.

09:56.045 --> 09:56.875
But, I...

09:56.912 --> 09:58.209
Two: You've spent your life

09:58.247 --> 10:00.807
swearing that the robots
will exterminate the clones

10:00.850 --> 10:02.317
by the end of 2010,

10:02.351 --> 10:03.909
so which is it,
robots or clones?

10:03.953 --> 10:05.545
I suppose...

10:05.588 --> 10:07.055
Three: You've already said

10:07.089 --> 10:09.990
you sympathize with the invading
Mongolians of 2087,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.859
so you'd be the last one
they'd send to fight'em.

10:12.895 --> 10:14.692
And four:
If you were from the future,

10:14.730 --> 10:16.322
you would've seen this coming:

10:17.466 --> 10:19.593
Yeah, man.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.500
Hey, any of you guys
feel like wrestling?

10:21.537 --> 10:22.834
Even me?

10:23.939 --> 10:25.497
Okay.

10:32.114 --> 10:36.574
It just hurts
so damn much! Ah!

10:41.791 --> 10:43.315
Great chicken, Peggy.

10:43.359 --> 10:45.452
Can we have some steak, too?

10:45.494 --> 10:48.986
Well, you certainly
seem to have a lot of energy, today.

10:49.031 --> 10:51.158
Yep, and you know,
this afternoon,

10:51.200 --> 10:54.033
I was pumping some iron,
and I was thinking

10:54.070 --> 10:56.038
Arlentinos Day
is gonna be great,

10:56.072 --> 10:59.701
and I came up with nine ways
you could expedite the workload.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.710
Hank, I didn't even know
you cared about my...

11:01.744 --> 11:04.577
In fact, why don't I just go
with you to the meeting tomorrow

11:04.613 --> 11:06.137
so I can tell everyone my ideas?

11:06.182 --> 11:08.980
I am upgrading your steak
from Salisbury to sirloin.

11:09.018 --> 11:10.576
Thanks, Peggy.

11:10.619 --> 11:11.916
Got-dang it, I love you.

11:11.954 --> 11:13.319
And I love you, too, son.

11:13.356 --> 11:14.983
How was P. E?

11:15.024 --> 11:16.719
Well, uh... you know.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.626
I just went in there,
in the shower,

11:19.662 --> 11:20.720
like you said,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.163
counted the tiles and got out.

11:23.199 --> 11:24.393
That's great, Bobby.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.560
Come on, let's go
do some push-ups.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.102
Huh?

11:28.537 --> 11:29.799
Wh?

11:29.839 --> 11:33.172
You know, Peggy,
<i>JAG</i> is a rerun tonight.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.177
Oh, Hank.

11:43.919 --> 11:45.648
<i>And so our bull run</i>

11:45.688 --> 11:48.782
will greatly resemble
the legendary bull run

11:48.824 --> 11:50.291
of Pamplona, Spain.

11:50.326 --> 11:53.227
Except that with ours,
the men and the bulls

11:53.262 --> 11:55.355
will be separated at all times

11:55.398 --> 11:57.730
by a 15-foot-high
chain-link fence.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.564
What? That's crazy!

11:59.602 --> 12:01.661
Hank, the insurance
is through the roof.

12:01.704 --> 12:03.296
We do not have
the funds for it.

12:03.339 --> 12:05.671
If we put on a bull run
with a safety fence,

12:05.708 --> 12:07.369
our whole town will look like

12:07.410 --> 12:09.139
a bunch
of got-dang jackasses,

12:09.178 --> 12:11.669
and I'll be got danged
if I'm gonna let that happen!

12:11.714 --> 12:12.976
Hank, easy.

12:13.015 --> 12:15.245
If money's the problem,
I'll raise it myself!

12:16.719 --> 12:19.119
I'll run with the bulls,
and I'll get every business

12:19.155 --> 12:20.918
in the tri-county area
to sponsor me.

12:20.956 --> 12:23.049
That'll cover the insurance
and then some.

12:24.894 --> 12:27.021
Honey, you are amazing.

12:29.031 --> 12:31.090
And in five days,
he's already raised

12:31.133 --> 12:33.499
half the insurance money
for the bull run.

12:33.536 --> 12:36.733
He is so energetic
and confident and happy

12:36.772 --> 12:38.262
and in shape and...

12:38.307 --> 12:39.740
Oh, sug,
he's having an affair.

12:39.775 --> 12:43.336
Wha... Nancy,
I can assure you,

12:43.379 --> 12:45.006
whatever's going on with Hank,

12:45.047 --> 12:46.878
is not being caused
by another woman.

12:46.916 --> 12:50.408
Sug, what else rejuvenates
a middle-aged man like that?

12:50.453 --> 12:52.978
An affair
would explain everything.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.614
Well, except for his pimples.

12:54.657 --> 12:56.625
Oh, now, those are just
a side effect.

12:56.659 --> 12:57.626
Side effect?

12:57.660 --> 12:58.957
From happiness.

12:58.994 --> 13:02.395
You know, they're just
little "zits of joy."

13:02.431 --> 13:04.092
That iced tea ready?

13:17.413 --> 13:18.505
Afternoon, ladies.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.009
Oh, Hank, stop.

13:26.288 --> 13:29.746
Hank, I've been watching
you jump that thing

13:29.792 --> 13:31.384
for three hours now.

13:31.427 --> 13:32.860
I'm exhausted.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.453
Yeah, you've trained enough.

13:34.497 --> 13:35.896
Besides, in a bull run,

13:35.931 --> 13:39.298
the only thing you'll have
to jump over are mangled bodies.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.269
I'm not done training,
you idiot!

13:41.303 --> 13:42.827
Now get on that lawn mower,

13:42.872 --> 13:44.703
and pretend
you're the bull. Now.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.503
Okay.

13:51.146 --> 13:53.171
Grr.

13:53.215 --> 13:54.876
Is that all
you got? C'mon!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.145
Hey!

13:56.185 --> 13:58.915
My God, Hank's getting
right in the bull's face.

13:58.954 --> 14:01.047
I'll kick your fat
bull ass! C'mon!

14:01.090 --> 14:02.250
Ow!

14:02.291 --> 14:03.781
You play too rough!

14:03.826 --> 14:04.986
I'm going home.

14:05.027 --> 14:06.426
Who wants to take his place?

14:06.462 --> 14:07.486
Talkin' about dang ol'

14:07.530 --> 14:08.519
no thank you, man.

14:08.564 --> 14:10.293
I have a lot of calls
to return.

14:10.332 --> 14:11.799
Well, fine, then.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.667
I don't want training help
from a bunch of wussies anyway.

14:17.072 --> 14:18.300
'Sup?

14:18.340 --> 14:19.500
'Sup?

14:26.181 --> 14:28.445
Hank, I picked up
some Clearasil for your acne.

14:28.484 --> 14:30.543
Hey, where are you
heading off to so fast?

14:30.586 --> 14:31.985
Well, I have to get
dinner ready.

14:32.021 --> 14:33.511
Dinner can wait.

14:33.556 --> 14:35.888
I say we hit the bedroom.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.859
Hank, we can't
fool around now.

14:37.893 --> 14:40.384
Your dad is on his way over
for dinner.

14:40.429 --> 14:41.521
What?

14:41.564 --> 14:43.930
Dang it,
he always ruins everything!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.661
Why does he have to be here?

14:45.701 --> 14:48.568
I got my own house so I wouldn't
have to deal with his crap.

14:48.604 --> 14:49.969
Can you hear yourself?

14:50.005 --> 14:51.700
Yeah, I can hear myself.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.037
Can you hear this?

14:57.279 --> 14:59.804
I never told you
to secretly dope your husband.

14:59.848 --> 15:01.748
Well, you didn't say
not to, did you?

15:01.784 --> 15:04.548
Medicine is no place
for mixed signals, Doctor.

15:04.587 --> 15:06.418
Peggy, the amount
of testosterone

15:06.455 --> 15:08.218
you've given
Hank is dangerous.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.724
You've effectively caused him

15:09.758 --> 15:11.089
to go through puberty again.

15:11.126 --> 15:13.060
Well, that explains
the constant hair combing

15:13.095 --> 15:15.586
and why he's hanging out
at the mall all the time.

15:15.631 --> 15:17.826
But don't worry,
I have stopped cold turkey.

15:17.866 --> 15:19.731
Whoa, don't do that.

15:19.768 --> 15:22.100
When the body is given
excessive testosterone,

15:22.137 --> 15:23.502
it stops making its own.

15:23.539 --> 15:26.167
Consequently, Hank's testicles
may have shrunken

15:26.208 --> 15:27.232
by as much as 20%.

15:27.276 --> 15:28.834
Oh, my God.

15:28.877 --> 15:31.209
This is just the kind of thing
that upsets him.

15:31.246 --> 15:33.680
And now, with no testosterone
coming from pills

15:33.716 --> 15:34.944
or from his own glands,

15:34.984 --> 15:37.043
Hank's cognitive and
physical abilities

15:37.086 --> 15:38.610
will be severely impaired.

15:38.654 --> 15:43.091
So you're saying that my husband
will be soft, timid and weak,

15:43.125 --> 15:45.093
and have defunct genitalia?

15:47.796 --> 15:49.525
It's okay, Peggy.

15:49.565 --> 15:52.261
He just needs to ease off
the testosterone gradually.

15:52.301 --> 15:54.360
Have him wear this
for about a week.

15:54.403 --> 15:56.098
It's a trans-scrotal patch.

15:57.139 --> 15:58.197
Of course it is.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.707
He'll affix it to his scrotum,

15:59.742 --> 16:01.937
and testosterone will
absorb into his system

16:01.977 --> 16:04.912
at slow, steady levels.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.677
And so it's come to this.

16:14.657 --> 16:15.624
Ah, dang it.

16:15.658 --> 16:16.989
I don't know what's wrong.

16:17.026 --> 16:19.460
It's like somebody sucked
all the life out of me.

16:19.495 --> 16:22.225
Hank, I have to tell you
something.

16:22.264 --> 16:24.459
You what?!

16:24.500 --> 16:26.127
Minh, come quick!

16:26.168 --> 16:27.808
Hank and Peggy having
old school, redneck,

16:27.836 --> 16:29.303
domestic squabble
on front lawn!

16:29.338 --> 16:31.135
How could you, Peggy?

16:31.173 --> 16:32.970
Oh, I bet she burn
the meat loaf.

16:33.008 --> 16:34.168
It caused what?

16:34.209 --> 16:36.143
Why he point at his crotch
like that?

16:36.178 --> 16:39.147
20% shrinkage?!

16:39.181 --> 16:42.150
You want me to put a patch
on my <i>what?!</i>

16:42.184 --> 16:45.347
Okay, this going in
a weird direction now.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.782
So over these last weeks,

16:47.823 --> 16:49.154
all my energy, my strength,

16:49.191 --> 16:51.785
my confidence, my happiness...

16:51.827 --> 16:53.988
Completely meaningless, Hank.

16:54.029 --> 16:55.189
I'm sorry.

16:56.231 --> 16:57.698
I think I want to yell at you,

16:57.733 --> 17:00.258
but I don't know if it's me
or the hormones,

17:00.302 --> 17:01.963
or the lack of 'em, or...

17:03.172 --> 17:04.537
Hey, Hank!

17:04.573 --> 17:06.097
I know you're already
all pumped up

17:06.141 --> 17:07.699
for the big bull run,

17:07.742 --> 17:10.268
but I thought this tape might
put you even more in the mood.

17:10.311 --> 17:13.109
<i>When Bull Gorings Go Bad</i>.

17:13.147 --> 17:14.775
You're a brave man, Hank.

17:14.817 --> 17:17.786
Personally, I watched
two minutes of it and vomited.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.810
Check out the pictures
on the back.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.421
I suppose we'll have
to call your sponsors

17:29.465 --> 17:31.592
and tell them you can't
run with the bulls tomorrow.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.329
I'm sure they'll understand when
I explain to them that you...

17:34.369 --> 17:35.461
Oh...

17:35.504 --> 17:37.563
No. I made a promise
to those people.

17:37.606 --> 17:39.403
Maybe you could wait a year.

17:39.441 --> 17:41.773
You know,
until you're full strength?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.505
No, sir.
Unless their checks bounced,

17:43.545 --> 17:44.842
I'm running with the bulls.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.939
But Hank, honey,
everything's changed.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.916
Now you aren't even able to...

17:48.951 --> 17:51.818
I can still do everything,
just not as well.

17:51.854 --> 17:55.017
The only real difference
is that now I'm scared.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.217
But if you're scared, why?

17:56.258 --> 17:59.284
Because a man does
what he has to do.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.455
You were scared to take
a shower in gym class,

18:01.497 --> 18:02.691
but you did it anyway.

18:02.731 --> 18:06.531
Well, running with
the bulls is my shower.

18:13.408 --> 18:17.310
If you feel like
you have to run tomorrow,

18:17.346 --> 18:18.540
at least wear this.

18:18.580 --> 18:20.514
There is no rule
that says you can't.

18:20.549 --> 18:22.540
No, Peggy, no
more testosterone.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.882
I'm not going
through puberty again.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.615
I didn't like it
when I was 14,

18:26.655 --> 18:28.350
and I didn't like
it last week.

18:28.390 --> 18:29.880
Your hormone level is so low

18:29.925 --> 18:32.257
this will give you just enough
to be normal.

18:32.294 --> 18:33.488
Like when you were a man.

18:52.948 --> 18:54.745
Mr. Hill, we are
so grateful for

18:54.783 --> 18:56.910
your enthusiasm
and your bravery.

18:56.952 --> 19:00.285
You have helped the Arlen Latin
Heritage Society greatly.

19:00.322 --> 19:01.584
Well, my pleasure.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.853
Obviously, we wanted
to say this to you now

19:03.892 --> 19:06.019
in the event that
you become dead

19:06.061 --> 19:07.892
sometime within
the next half hour.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.863
Come on, Bobby,
it's time to go to the parade!

19:28.750 --> 19:31.218
Runners, take your places!

19:45.601 --> 19:47.000
Hank!

19:47.035 --> 19:50.903
Hank Hill! I demand that
you put this on yourself, now!

19:50.939 --> 19:52.463
Peggy, put that away!

19:52.507 --> 19:55.067
Dad, don't run with the bulls!

19:55.110 --> 19:57.408
You don't have
to prove anything to me!

19:57.446 --> 20:00.472
I lied to you!
I never showered!

20:00.515 --> 20:02.915
I was too scared!

20:02.951 --> 20:03.883
You what?!

20:03.919 --> 20:06.581
I'm sorry! I failed you!

20:06.622 --> 20:09.591
That's why
I'm not worth dying for!

20:09.625 --> 20:11.092
Wear the patch, Hank!

20:11.126 --> 20:13.117
Don't run, Dad!

20:13.161 --> 20:15.595
Bobby, I'm running
with the bulls,

20:15.631 --> 20:18.099
and I'm gonna do it
without the patch.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.600
Between the drugging
and the lying,

20:19.635 --> 20:21.899
one of us in this family
has got to show some

20:21.937 --> 20:24.428
got-dang integrity!

20:33.949 --> 20:35.075
Okay, Hank, macho!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.454
Run, Hank!

20:39.488 --> 20:40.785
All right, Hank!

20:50.032 --> 20:55.026
This is the bravest thing I've
ever seen in my entire life.

20:57.940 --> 21:01.000
Just count the tiles.

21:02.411 --> 21:03.901
One, two...

21:03.946 --> 21:05.573
That's my soap.

21:05.614 --> 21:07.241
Three, four...

21:07.282 --> 21:08.749
Dudes, check me out.

21:08.784 --> 21:11.753
I call this
"eggs over easy."

21:11.787 --> 21:15.518
Five, six...
