00:07.842 --> 00:09.385
What about under your desk?

00:09.427 --> 00:10.928
I did. He's not there.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.847
- The bathroom?
- Not there, either.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.141
He might be between the couch
cushions in the break room.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.602
What time exactly did you notice
that he was missing?

00:18.644 --> 00:20.020
Okay, if I'm being honest,

00:20.062 --> 00:22.398
I lost Mr. Caputo's hard drive
weeks ago.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.566
- Aleesha!
- Before you freak out,

00:24.567 --> 00:26.402
he is in this building
somewhere.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.612
I know he is.
I was printing a sandwich,

00:28.654 --> 00:30.948
and then it got stuck
between two fat cartridges,

00:30.990 --> 00:32.783
so I set Mr. Caputo down.

00:32.825 --> 00:35.202
You are not supposed to use
two fat cartridges.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.139
Wait, were you the one
who broke the printer, Aleesha?

00:37.163 --> 00:38.456
I don't care!

00:38.497 --> 00:40.207
If you don't find him
in 20 minutes,

00:40.291 --> 00:42.001
you are getting into his avatar

00:42.042 --> 00:43.562

the role of Mr. Caputo

00:43.586 --> 00:45.587
until his wife dies!

00:45.588 --> 00:47.298
- On it.
- And, Nora,

00:47.339 --> 00:49.550
did you ever watch
the mandatory HR video

00:49.592 --> 00:52.803
on preventing
scan-angel romance?

00:52.845 --> 00:53.971
I watched it, yes.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.681
- Did you understand it?
- I did.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.435
So can you explain to me
why you were found in the arms

00:59.477 --> 01:02.980
of an upload, asleep,
this morning at 6:00 a.m.?

01:03.022 --> 01:06.400
I-I came in after-hours
to get a jump on work,

01:06.442 --> 01:08.319
and I-I drifted off.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.904
It'll never happen again.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.322
Yeah. Okay.
Because if it does,

01:11.363 --> 01:13.908
I will knock you down to a...

01:13.949 --> 01:15.451
What are you at now?

01:15.493 --> 01:16.494
A 5.8.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.413
I will knock you down to a 4.8.

01:19.455 --> 01:20.581
No!

01:20.623 --> 01:23.250
There is no 5.8.
You're at 4.8.

01:23.292 --> 01:27.922
I will knock you down to a 3.8
like... that.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.343
And you, Batia, I don't know

what you're pickling in those
murky jars underneath your desk,

02:00.996 --> 02:02.581
Didn't think I was smart, too?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.291
I got

in trouble for falling asleep
next to you last night.

Oh, man.
That's brutal.

That's-that's my fault.

It was fine.

Well, you could set an alarm

02:28.691 --> 02:31.110
Interesting.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.947
There's an alarm clock
in your suite.

Maybe I should remember

If we were gonna do,
um, that again,

You know, I owe her that.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.591
Plus, she could delete me.

No.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.406
I don't even like him.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.409
It was just, you know,
something that happened.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.703
He was his close friend,
and he came over

04:04.745 --> 04:06.455
looking for Nathan's hard drive
one night

04:06.497 --> 04:08.290
after Nathan and I
had had a fight.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.001
And before I even knew it,
we were in bed.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.420
Uh, I thought you said kissing.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.300
And a handy, okay?

04:18.342 --> 04:21.428
Wow. Happier now?

04:29.979 --> 04:32.314
All right, just pick one!

Wow.

You want to say hi,

04:44.576 --> 04:47.037
maybe show him around?

04:47.079 --> 04:48.765
Uh, yeah. I...
You know, I didn't have the...

04:48.789 --> 04:50.332
best luck with dads.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.268
I was the guy that
kind of just waited in the car

04:52.292 --> 04:53.919
and didn't go to the door.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.338
- He's not gonna be judging you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.340
No, he's just there
to take the tour.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.218
And maybe you can help me
sell it to him.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.470
Okay.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.431
- Oh, and one last thing.
- Yeah?

05:06.557 --> 05:07.891
Checkmate.

- Wait, what?
- See ya.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.939
Never lost a game, huh?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.484
What I said was
I never played a game.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.670
You made me look like an idiot.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.988
You think I wanted to?

05:21.030 --> 05:24.616
So, I've been thinking
about deactivating Nathan.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.872
Not forever. Just, you know,
maybe six days a week.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.707

05:31.749 --> 05:33.959

Tough.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.881
Yeah. Um, tough situation.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.091
Yeah. Uh, next? Jen?

05:41.133 --> 05:43.635
Ooh, ooh. Sorry.
Um, I actually...

05:43.677 --> 05:46.221
I wrote a little list of pros
and cons for freezing Nathan.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.640
Don't worry, Jen.
This will be, like, so fast.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.808

Cavern Investments' partner
Josh Pitzer

05:58.609 --> 06:00.569

in Inglewood.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.406
The venture capitalist and nine
others were apparently taken in

06:04.448 --> 06:06.366
by a counterfeit upload scam,

06:06.408 --> 06:09.369
paying $1,000 each to have
their heads burned off

06:09.411 --> 06:11.747
by a fake scanner.

06:11.789 --> 06:15.000
I forgot to say that footage
could be disturbing

06:15.042 --> 06:16.877
to some viewers.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.882
Josh Pitzer ring a bell to you?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.300
Nope.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.052
Oh, wait,
does he design jackets,

06:25.094 --> 06:27.429
like, really fitted,
with embroidered leather?

06:27.471 --> 06:29.264
God, sometimes...

06:29.306 --> 06:31.266
No. One of your damaged memories

06:31.308 --> 06:33.435
was selling Beyond
at his office.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.354
I talked to him last week,
and...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.481
he died yesterday.

06:37.523 --> 06:38.482
Oh, man.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.900
You think it's connected?

06:39.942 --> 06:42.361
Uh, yeah.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.238
I want to do some snooping

06:44.279 --> 06:46.406
and see if someone
did break in to your head.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.991
Are you cool with that?

06:48.033 --> 06:49.094
And find out who killed me?

06:49.118 --> 06:50.744
Nah, I'm kind of over it.

06:50.786 --> 06:51.870
Wait, what?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.622
Yes, of course. Please.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.082
If you want to be a detective,

06:55.124 --> 06:56.416

06:58.293 --> 06:59.920
be careful, okay?

07:02.381 --> 07:03.340
Oh, my God!

07:03.382 --> 07:04.716
- You found him?
- No.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.011
- Are you okay?
- Yes! My dad's in the store.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.806
Comfortable?

07:10.848 --> 07:13.433
Oh, yeah.
I'm loving every minute of it.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.352
Wait, what are you...
What are you doing?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.896

07:56.226 --> 07:57.495
Would you like to buy
some Orbit gum?

07:57.519 --> 07:58.937
I said no to your stupid gum!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.230
Chew on this!

08:01.190 --> 08:02.441
Oh, sh...

08:02.482 --> 08:04.902
Gum. Gum.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.528
- Oh, I made it worse.
- Gum. Gum.

08:12.951 --> 08:13.952
Pro.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.245
If I freeze Nathan,

08:15.287 --> 08:16.914
I can see how things play out

08:16.955 --> 08:18.332
with the rest of my 20s and 30s.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.791
Okay.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.877
Con. He'll miss
his friends and family

08:21.919 --> 08:23.545
who will grow old without him.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.880
Pro.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.757
Fewer friends
means more time for me.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.425
Okay, con.

You lower your chances
of maintaining intimacy

08:30.594 --> 08:32.346

08:32.387 --> 08:35.349
Pro. My AC is out,
and I can't afford to fix it

08:35.390 --> 08:37.017
and get Nathan
all the extras he wants

08:37.059 --> 08:38.644
without asking my dad for money.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.437
You can't put a price on love.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.689
Oh, really?
Where's your husband?

08:42.731 --> 08:45.359

Okay. Thank you

- Okay, okay, I'm ready.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.368
Come on, give it to me.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.250
Dad!

09:05.379 --> 09:08.882
Okay, okay. This isn't terrible.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.927
Weird, but not terrible.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.352
You're not wearing
your uniform today.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.396
Nope.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.942
I just can't decide what to get.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.610
Well, you'll figure it out.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.655
If someone told me what to do,
I'd do it.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.492
Mm.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.369
Honeydew melon.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.623
Sir, yes, sir.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.383
- Angel.
- Yes, handsome?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.385
Oh, that's cool.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.178

09:55.220 --> 09:57.097
Oh, hey.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.266

- Really good.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.102
Oh, God. Never mind.
Get out of here.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.522
Dad, this is Nathan Brown

10:05.564 --> 10:07.607
who offered
to show you around today.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.026
Nice to meet you, sir.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.902
You, too. I guess.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.322
So, I'll leave you guys to it.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.615
Try to have fun just for me.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.410
- Look for the laughs
like with Mom, okay?
- Sounds good, Noni.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.329
Bye.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.833
Nathan,
show me Lakeview amenities.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.710
I'm having trouble
understanding you.

10:26.752 --> 10:29.671
I found 7,000 results
for "Lakeview enemies."

10:29.713 --> 10:30.797
Oh, for Christ's sake.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.591
No, I'm just messing with you.
I'm a person.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.134
Let's go.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
Good Lord.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.686
Every day. All you can eat.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.731
- Ooh-la-la.
- Mm-hmm.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.734
Oh! There's my friend Luke
hanging with Mildred Kannerman.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.277
Look at them getting along.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.653
Weird.
She doesn't have any color.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.697
Yeah, she's over 100 years old.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.742
I find that disgusting.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.120
Okay. Uh, or...

11:02.162 --> 11:04.247
is it beautiful, you know?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.476
Two people who would have barely
overlapped in the real world

11:06.500 --> 11:07.959
can talk
and become friends here.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.962
When he was born,
she was 72 years old.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.006
It's inspiring.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.716
I paid extra
for double-jointedness,

11:14.758 --> 11:16.927
which means I can put
my avatar's legs over my head.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.721
Oh, I'm gonna jump on you
like a live grenade.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.473
I could blow you off your feet.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.308
Yet somehow it works.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.102
Uh...

11:25.143 --> 11:26.937
Mm.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.271
Hey, Nathan.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.023
I like my steak rare.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.275
Wait, that's, uh...

11:32.317 --> 11:33.402
- Yep.
- And there's nothing

11:33.443 --> 11:35.946
more rare than black rhino meat.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.031
They had to kill the last one

11:38.073 --> 11:40.659
to program the taste right.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.620
Okay. Well, that's lunch.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.222
Let's keep this train moving,
all right?

11:45.247 --> 11:47.290
Yeah. Choo choo!

11:47.332 --> 11:48.851
That was everything
I thought it would be.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.211
- Weird as hell.
- Yeah. You know,

11:51.253 --> 11:52.897
digital life extension
isn't what you'd expect.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.048
It's not real life,
and it's not heaven.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.008
No, it's not.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.303
You see, Nathan, when you died,
your soul went to real heaven.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.807
So whatever simulation
I'm talking to now has no soul.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.392
It's an abomination.

12:05.434 --> 12:09.187
Okay. Or there is no soul,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.439
you know, and there never was.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.815
And in a sense,

12:11.857 --> 12:13.577
both of our consciousnesses
are simulations,

12:13.608 --> 12:15.318
mine on a silicon computer

12:15.360 --> 12:17.654
and yours on a computer made
of meat, your brain.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.656
- But there is a soul.
- Okay.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
So, you expect to be...

12:21.116 --> 12:23.869
playing a harp on a cloud
or something?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.830
If I told you I knew
my wife was waiting for me

12:26.872 --> 12:28.915
and the only thing
I've been thinking about

12:28.957 --> 12:32.711
ever since she left me was
to hold her in my arms again,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.213
what could you say
to get me to upload?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.466
Dad.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.802
Nothing.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.388
So you believe
in it all literally?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.640
I believe I was happiest
when we were all together,

12:45.682 --> 12:48.185
and the only way for us to be
together again, including Nora,

12:48.226 --> 12:49.603
is after we're all dead.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.522
Is that creepy?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.191
- Yes.
- A little.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.942
Thank you!

12:55.984 --> 12:57.152
I am almost there.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.337
Well, just look out the window.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.446
I'm crossing the street.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.947
I'll be there in seconds.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.782
No, I am not late again.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.343
What do you think,
I'm just leaving work right now?

13:04.367 --> 13:07.412
Well, I'm not.
Ground floor. Ground floor.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.623
I don't know who said that.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.127
Hey, Leesh.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.255
Lucy left her computer on
and her door open,

13:17.297 --> 13:19.257
so I think I'm gonna snoop
while she's at lunch.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.675
Cover me.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.303
Okay. Okay, I'll cover you.
I got you, girl.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.431
Like the female
Jason Bourne reboot.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.684
I got you
soon as I get Mr. Caputo.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.977
Where...?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.367
"Dear Ms. Slack,

13:45.408 --> 13:47.869
"No, we can't refund the shoes
you wore all winter

13:47.911 --> 13:50.330
which have
extensive snow damage."

13:58.630 --> 14:02.092
This is one of the best parts
of Lakeview: memory parlor.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.844
They can turn any memory
you have into a video for you,

14:04.886 --> 14:07.639
even something you
barely remember from childhood.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.934
Huh. You willing
to let me take a peek?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.479
Yeah, okay.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.815
I got nothing to hide.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.401
Hmm, what should I pick?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.860
Top fails 2025?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.320
Bed-wetting compilation?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.655
Senior prom?

14:23.697 --> 14:26.324
- Oh.
- I'll be nice.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.286
Show me the last time
you played sports with your dad.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.496
Uh, actually, I'd rather not,
if that's okay.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.290
I'd like to see
the man who raised you.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.499
I think it would say a lot.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.251
- Uh...
- Here we go.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.504
♪ ♪

14:43.842 --> 14:44.944
I meant something more recent.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.887
That is most recent.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.473
One... two... You ready?

14:50.515 --> 14:52.267
- Yes!
- Three!

14:52.309 --> 14:55.770
You did it! You did it!

14:55.812 --> 14:58.732
You couldn't have done
a better job, Nathan.

14:58.773 --> 15:02.152
That was perfect.
That was perfect.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.279
- Where's the ball?
- Where is the ball?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.756
Seemed like a good guy.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.507
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.093
Oh, he's not dead.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.095
At least, I don't think he is.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.556
Not even sure he knows
I'm dead, so...

15:31.598 --> 15:33.975
Okay.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.019
Let's go.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.126
Easy, girl.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.295
Whoa, girl. Whoa.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.065
What's the deal with this guy?
He's everywhere.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.674
- Yeah, he's AI.
- Ugh.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.134
No, I'm with you on that one.
He is the worst.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.011
He definitely
doesn't have a soul.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.347
God, no. Look at him.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.015
Happy trails, gentlemen.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.977
I mean, I was barely
aware I was alive.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.647
Just kind of went to clubs
and did my work.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.149
- Was a bit of an asshole.
- Mm-hmm.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.945
But now, my eyes have been
opened to a lot of things.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.905
I'm starting to really
appreciate what I have.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.533
I mean, if you said,
right now, I could go back

16:31.574 --> 16:33.535
the way things were before,

16:33.576 --> 16:35.578
I don't know if I'd do it.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.789
This experience has been
that good?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.958
In some ways, yeah.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.418
I mean,
I met your daughter here,

16:41.459 --> 16:43.962
and she's better
than any friend I had before.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.840
Even if we last
for a thousand years here,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.508
it's gonna feel short
when it's over,

16:48.550 --> 16:51.177
and we're out of time
with the people we care about.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.012
I think
that's what really matters.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.433
You actually have
some depth to you.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.017
Maybe even a soul?

16:58.059 --> 16:59.769
At least a personality.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.479
I'll take it.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.788
Come on. Give me something.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.463
"I have proof that someone is

17:26.504 --> 17:27.464

17:27.505 --> 17:28.465

"Your reputation will be damaged

17:30.300 --> 17:32.302

17:34.095 --> 17:35.680
Interesting.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.311
- This little piggy went
to market.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.271
And this little piggy went home.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.940
This little piggy
had roast beef.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.484
And this...

17:47.525 --> 17:49.527
little piggy just had
the best sex.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.418
What is that?

18:13.593 --> 18:14.844
Oh.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.139
Was not me!

18:19.641 --> 18:21.434
Maple bacon donut.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.894
Whoa.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.522
- Hey.
- Ew!

18:28.024 --> 18:30.568
Lovely. Now I'm Pac-Man.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.238
Oh!

18:33.279 --> 18:34.656
- Did we do this?
- Maybe.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.326
Awesome. What a day.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.538
Okay, I swear
this has never happened before.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.248
What the hell?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.041
Man, I feel like
we were just starting

18:45.083 --> 18:46.668
to relate
to each other as equals.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.087
Mm-hmm.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.421
You still look great.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.006
Thanks.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.133
Phew. Not in the face.

All right, everyone,
please remain calm.

Feel free to use the fire stairs
next to the elevator.

Aleesha, where is Nora?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.899
Oh. Um... she just ran out.

19:09.941 --> 19:13.111
Can't believe the reflexes
on that girl.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.635
same person
you were just talking to.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.053
Mm-hmm.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.432
Oh. Oh, oh. Hey... there.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.225
See? Temporary.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.269
You know, what makes a person
a person...

19:46.311 --> 19:48.229
Let's just walk silently
for a bit.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.648
You got it.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.875
- Oh. Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, excuse me.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.252
-What are you doing?
I'm trying to get off this...
-Oh!

20:11.294 --> 20:12.813
- Oh, this is such a...
- Excuse me. Aleesha!

20:12.837 --> 20:15.214
Oh, did you ever find
Mr. Caputo?

20:15.256 --> 20:18.343
I did... not.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.345
As soon as you get back
to your desk,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.096
I want you
to get into his avatar

20:22.138 --> 20:24.974
and take Mrs. Caputo dancing!

20:26.017 --> 20:27.435
Shit.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.187
Run, ho! Run!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.619
So the system went to backup?

20:44.661 --> 20:46.204
Yes, Mr. Whitbridge.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.872
For, like, five minutes.
That's all.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.290
Well, what happened? Sabotage?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.125
No, nothing.
It was just, you know...

20:54.671 --> 20:55.773
Blame it on the power company.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.590
It was just a little
local brownout.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.526
- That's all.
- You think
the Ludds were involved?

20:59.550 --> 21:01.177
If you want them to be, sir.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.350
So, how was he, Dad?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.227
Go easy on me.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.604
Well, to be honest...

21:14.232 --> 21:15.876
you couldn't have done
a better job, Nathan.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.695
That was perfect. Just...

21:18.736 --> 21:20.321
perfect.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.323
Thank you.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.951

22:52.413 --> 22:54.207
So you liked him?

22:55.958 --> 22:58.044
He sold the hell
out of that place.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.506
He... he-he made me see
the appeal that it has.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.094
Well, what about...

23:06.135 --> 23:07.970
outside
of his tour guide skills?

23:08.012 --> 23:09.430
Yeah, you've got good taste.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.684
He's a great guy.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.064
I just wish you'd met him
when he was alive.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.150
Um...

23:21.192 --> 23:23.236
I don't think
he's a romantic possibility.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.862
It's just too hard.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.989
It's too tough.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.993
I'm sorry, Nora.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.584
Well, if you're not going
to upload,

23:38.626 --> 23:41.337
can you do one thing for me?

23:41.379 --> 23:43.381
Anything.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.388
Can you say "hi" to Mom for me?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.100
Of course.
