00:00.322 --> 00:02.451
5-5-David,
I just saw armed suspect

00:02.452 --> 00:03.751
going south down Holden.

00:03.753 --> 00:05.453
He's in a dark Ford Taurus,

00:05.455 --> 00:07.238
turning right
on Washington near Holden.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.207
That's it. That's him.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.375
In pursuit
of a black Ford Taurus

00:11.377 --> 00:14.829
going westbound on Washington,
crossing State.

00:14.831 --> 00:18.966
Arizona license plate 52B7HN

00:44.793 --> 00:46.160
Hold on.

00:50.286 --> 00:51.620
Morgan!

00:56.789 --> 00:59.256
Is he serious?

00:59.258 --> 01:00.841
He moved in
two months ago.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.760
He's still putting
together furniture?

01:02.762 --> 01:04.561
It's only 8:00 at night.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.680
You've got
to get him to stop.

01:06.682 --> 01:09.066
After this page,
I'll go talk to him.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.268
Talk to him?
Or bludgeon him?

01:28.620 --> 01:30.955
What, are they doing it
on the floor?

01:32.340 --> 01:33.907
I need to study now.

01:33.909 --> 01:35.009
Put your headphones on.

01:35.011 --> 01:38.679
You know what? If you
won't do it, I will.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.648
I said I would do it
after this page.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.999
Corin!

01:56.014 --> 01:57.731
Uhh!

01:58.566 --> 02:01.618
Open the door!

02:01.620 --> 02:04.538
I know you're in there.
I can hear you!

02:04.540 --> 02:07.374
The whole building can!

02:07.376 --> 02:08.392
Really?

02:08.394 --> 02:10.577
Open the door!
Hello?

02:13.531 --> 02:15.032
Hey.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.700
Look, I hate to be
a buzz-kill,

02:16.702 --> 02:18.452
but I have a huge
test tomorrow.

02:20.389 --> 02:22.873
My roommate's
at it again, huh?

02:22.875 --> 02:24.725
We're right below you.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.144
I'll tell him you showed up.

02:27.146 --> 02:29.063
Ever since he met this chick,

02:29.065 --> 02:31.548
they've been going at it
like rabbits.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.650
Maybe they should
go to her place.

02:33.652 --> 02:35.352
I'll suggest that.

02:35.354 --> 02:37.438
Sorry.

03:10.722 --> 03:13.891
We were this close
to going to Ocean City,

03:13.893 --> 03:15.142
and I get the text.

03:15.144 --> 03:17.061
I was in the middle of calculating
force times distance

03:17.063 --> 03:18.562
times the co-efficient
of friction to determine

03:18.564 --> 03:20.697
how fast I can make
a hairpin turn in a Prius.

03:20.699 --> 03:22.132
You don't have
a hybrid, Spence.

03:22.134 --> 03:23.400
I know, but if I did,
I'd want to know.

03:23.402 --> 03:24.952
Hey.
Hey.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.320
Weren't we just here?

03:26.322 --> 03:28.105
Did your date
understand?

03:28.107 --> 03:29.540
Ah, luckily
we're neighbors.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.958
Hmm.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.743
You must be peeved.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.496
I get to Dulles,
make it through security,

03:35.498 --> 03:37.280
about to board
the plane to Boston,

03:37.282 --> 03:39.116
and bam, I get the call.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.968
I say we all
demand a vacation.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.004
From who, the guy that works 3 jobs?
Good luck with that.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.964
Hey.

03:53.966 --> 03:55.799
Whoa, you never
went home.

03:55.801 --> 03:57.582
No, I had these unit chief

03:57.592 --> 03:59.595
performance appraisals
to do when we got back.

03:59.596 --> 04:01.417
So how many all-nighters
have you pulled this month?

04:01.418 --> 04:04.068
I don't know. Between
the file reviews and the appraisals,

04:04.069 --> 04:05.769
there isn't enough time.

04:07.505 --> 04:12.275
Erin would, uh, always bring
her work home with her.

04:13.778 --> 04:16.529
Yeah, I know.
She definitely underplayed

04:16.531 --> 04:18.982
the amount of paperwork.

04:18.983 --> 04:21.785
So, how long do you
think they're gonna

04:21.786 --> 04:24.120
ask you to do
this double duty?

04:24.122 --> 04:27.073
Well, they asked me if I'd
be interested in the job full-time.

04:27.075 --> 04:29.042
That would mean
leaving the BAU.

04:29.044 --> 04:31.211
I bought myself some
time by asking them

04:31.213 --> 04:33.213
to at least
post the position.

04:33.215 --> 04:35.882
Well, we both know
the pros and cons.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.384
There are
lots of them.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.085
We'll talk
about it later.

04:40.555 --> 04:43.490
Sorry you guys had
to come in again. Garcia?

04:43.492 --> 04:44.791
Yeah. Two women,

04:44.793 --> 04:46.243
Sarah Beck and Jill Elks,

04:46.245 --> 04:49.045
were found in a park in Glendale,
Arizona, within the last 3 days.

04:49.047 --> 04:50.680
Both of them were single,
in their late 20s,

04:50.682 --> 04:53.733
and following their normal, low-risk
routines when they were abducted.

04:53.735 --> 04:55.435
Where were they
taken from?

04:55.437 --> 04:57.687
Sarah was on her way
to a theater group rehearsal,

04:57.689 --> 05:00.056
and Jill was abducted
from her apartment.

05:00.058 --> 05:02.025
The unsub broke in
through a window.

05:02.027 --> 05:03.860
Well, clearly, he's hunting
a specific type.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.562
He left the jewelry untouched.

05:05.564 --> 05:07.080
Yeah, it's not
about robbery.

05:07.082 --> 05:09.699
Both women were sexually assaulted,
and then they were shot in the heart

05:09.701 --> 05:12.485
and left in that
prayer position.

05:12.487 --> 05:14.037
That's odd.

05:14.039 --> 05:17.740
Maybe it's religious. It looks
like they're leaning on a cross.

05:17.742 --> 05:20.360
Their hands
are tilted forward.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.711
He could have
made them supplicate

05:21.713 --> 05:23.380
and their hands clenched
in rigor mortis.

05:23.382 --> 05:26.349
So they're possibly praying
to atone for their sins.

05:26.351 --> 05:28.935
I doubt that. Both women have
pretty clean backgrounds.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.587
Since the posing
was done postmortem,

05:30.589 --> 05:32.222
maybe it's a representation
of the way in which

05:32.224 --> 05:34.190
he made them beg
for their lives.

05:34.192 --> 05:35.275
We've definitely
seen that before.

05:35.277 --> 05:36.860
He's getting off
on the power.

05:36.862 --> 05:40.280
Let's head to Arizona.
Wheels up in 30.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.568
Ohh!

05:44.570 --> 05:47.270
Please, please,
not so fast.

05:47.272 --> 05:48.371
Go.

05:48.373 --> 05:50.073
I can't.

05:50.075 --> 05:52.292
It hurts.

05:59.951 --> 06:04.621
You're not gonna
get away with this.

06:07.124 --> 06:09.392
They're gonna find you!

"Who knows where
inspiration comes from?

06:56.585 --> 06:59.235
"Perhaps it arises
from desperation.

06:59.237 --> 07:02.506
"Perhaps it comes
from the flukes of the universe,

07:02.508 --> 07:04.624
the kindness of the muses."

07:04.626 --> 07:06.393
Amy Tan.

07:06.395 --> 07:08.295
All right, let's go over
victimology.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.747
Both of these women were professionals,
young, single, blond,

07:10.749 --> 07:12.716
both in their late 20s,
and petite.

07:12.718 --> 07:14.968
And besides appearance,
there's no apparent connection.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.520
The prayer position is unique.

07:16.522 --> 07:18.722
Both these women
were left in parks.

07:18.724 --> 07:21.090
The dumpsites could be symbolic.
I mean, a lot of religions

07:21.092 --> 07:22.592
are based in nature,
celebrating the outdoors.

07:22.594 --> 07:24.060
Pilgrimages are often
made to parks.

07:24.062 --> 07:26.530
Believers say they're closer
to God in places like that.

07:26.532 --> 07:28.097
Maybe he believes
they're surrogates

07:28.099 --> 07:30.734
for a woman who cheated
on him or rejected him.

07:30.736 --> 07:33.236
Either way, the unsub participates
in high-risk behavior.

07:33.238 --> 07:34.604
He abducts and controls
the victims,

07:34.606 --> 07:36.156
takes them
to secluded locations,

07:36.158 --> 07:38.241
rapes them and kills them,
all within 12 hours.

07:38.243 --> 07:39.826
His yet to be
determined ritual

07:39.828 --> 07:41.461
leaves no outward
indicators.

07:41.463 --> 07:43.113
Well, we know he has a gun,

07:43.115 --> 07:45.799
the ability to abduct his
victims, take them to a lair,

07:45.801 --> 07:46.950
and discard them in a park.

07:46.952 --> 07:48.668
So he probably
has a van or SUV.

07:48.670 --> 07:49.953
And he's planned
things out.

07:49.955 --> 07:51.972
He abducted one victim
on her way to a theater,

07:51.974 --> 07:53.273
another one
from her apartment.

07:53.275 --> 07:54.758
So he stalks them.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.259
The consistency
of the disposal sites

07:56.261 --> 07:57.794
and methodologies tells us
that he has no known

07:57.796 --> 07:59.913
or identifiable connection
between any of the victims

07:59.915 --> 08:01.364
and in fact
wants them to be found

08:01.366 --> 08:03.183
in order to convey
his posed prayer message.

08:03.185 --> 08:04.901
Well, the parks will give us
behavioral clues

08:04.903 --> 08:06.803
to help us fill out
our profile.

08:06.805 --> 08:08.572
All right, we should split up
when we hit the ground.

08:08.574 --> 08:11.525
He's probably already
chosen his next victim.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.119
You want a double shot
or a regular?

08:39.121 --> 08:40.135
Regular.

08:40.138 --> 08:41.504
You sure, Wallace?

08:41.506 --> 08:43.190
It's free since
you work in the mall.

08:43.192 --> 08:44.958
I'm fine.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.010
Hey, what time do you get off?

08:47.012 --> 08:49.896
Why, you got
something planned?

08:49.898 --> 08:52.933
You want to go
sit by the fountain?

08:52.935 --> 08:54.501
Oh...

08:54.503 --> 08:56.603
I would,
but I got a date.

08:56.605 --> 08:58.855
I gotta go.

08:59.824 --> 09:03.026
See you tomorrow,
Wallace.

09:03.028 --> 09:07.531
Ok. Thanks.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.949
Thank you.

09:08.951 --> 09:10.250
Yeah.

09:10.252 --> 09:12.201
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:14.255 --> 09:16.006
You want her,
too, Wallace?

09:16.008 --> 09:18.207
Leave me alone.

09:18.209 --> 09:22.062
Leave me the hell alone.

09:22.064 --> 09:23.730
This type of detailed
ritualistic behavior

09:23.732 --> 09:27.017
typically manifests itself in multiple
kills over a short period of time.

09:27.019 --> 09:29.402
I've increased the manpower
on the street.

09:29.404 --> 09:31.471
I was even thinking about doing
a press conference.

09:31.473 --> 09:33.723
At this point, it would be better
if we could conduct our analysis

09:33.725 --> 09:35.609
without media interference.

09:35.611 --> 09:37.077
We'll need a separate room
to do interviews.

09:37.079 --> 09:38.128
There's one
over there.

09:38.130 --> 09:39.429
Sergeant?
Yeah?

09:39.431 --> 09:41.731
Another vic, Emma Coleman,
was found in Bonsall Park.

09:41.733 --> 09:42.749
That's a mile
from here.

09:42.751 --> 09:44.400
And two miles from
the other dumpsite,

09:44.402 --> 09:47.070
which tells us the unsub's zone
of comfort is within a 3-mile radius.

09:47.072 --> 09:48.605
I'll reroute Morgan and Rossi
to the scene.

09:48.607 --> 09:51.074
And we'll see if we can
locate her next of kin.

09:51.076 --> 09:52.742
Good. We'll need
to talk to them.

09:52.744 --> 09:54.344
Ok.

09:58.517 --> 10:01.334
All right, Rossi,
talk to me.

10:01.336 --> 10:02.936
What's up?

10:02.938 --> 10:05.922
Only the sun.
I like the sun.

10:05.924 --> 10:07.257
Cute.
That's real cute.

10:07.259 --> 10:08.308
Look, when
I was the gym,

10:08.310 --> 10:10.226
conversation around
the free weights

10:10.228 --> 10:12.679
is Hotch is interviewing
to be Strauss's permanent replacement.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.531
I know nothing.

10:14.533 --> 10:16.283
Come on, man,
you sure about that?

10:16.285 --> 10:18.468
Why do I get the feeling
you're being a profiler?

10:18.470 --> 10:20.487
If you have any questions
about Hotch,

10:20.489 --> 10:22.555
maybe you should ask Hotch.

10:22.557 --> 10:24.374
Ok, look, I get it.
Doing double duty

10:24.376 --> 10:27.777
after the sequester, fine, but taking on
a desk job full-time?

10:27.779 --> 10:29.763
You know what they say
about desk jobs.

10:29.765 --> 10:31.464
That's how
you get the ladies?

10:31.466 --> 10:33.383
No. Sitting
is the new smoking.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.635
That'll kill Hotch,
and you know that.

10:35.637 --> 10:38.104
Well, it's the same
as last time,

10:38.106 --> 10:39.973
except this woman
has light-brown hair.

10:39.975 --> 10:41.341
Looks like
she threw up.

10:41.343 --> 10:42.959
Maybe it was nerves.

10:42.961 --> 10:45.428
She knew she was going to die.

10:46.681 --> 10:48.214
She had on a wedding ring.

10:48.216 --> 10:51.217
It's right over there.
He must have tossed it.

10:51.219 --> 10:52.569
Strange.

10:52.571 --> 10:55.488
Yeah, all of the other victims
were single females.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.241
Jewelry was left
untouched.

10:58.243 --> 11:00.143
So either this guy
has a disdain for marriage

11:00.145 --> 11:02.278
or his fantasy
is single women.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.613
So maybe he got rid
of the ring

11:03.615 --> 11:05.782
'cause it didn't
fit his parameters.

11:05.784 --> 11:07.167
If that's the case,
why not go after

11:07.169 --> 11:08.702
a single woman
in the first place?

11:08.704 --> 11:12.455
And why not take off the ring
during the rape?

11:12.457 --> 11:14.507
That is the question.

11:28.189 --> 11:30.607
This is a dream, right?

11:31.709 --> 11:33.693
You're going to tell me
this is a nightmare?

11:33.695 --> 11:35.795
We know this is difficult,
Mr. Coleman.

11:35.797 --> 11:38.948
I don't know what to say.
I need to call her parents.

11:38.950 --> 11:42.118
Can we--can we ask you
a few questions first?

11:42.120 --> 11:45.622
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

11:45.624 --> 11:47.273
Two days ago.

11:48.759 --> 11:50.827
Two days ago?

11:50.829 --> 11:52.162
That's--
that's a long time.

11:52.164 --> 11:54.330
Why didn't you
call the police?

11:54.332 --> 11:56.049
We've been separated.

11:56.051 --> 11:59.302
Yesterday Emma was supposed
to meet me at counseling,

11:59.304 --> 12:01.871
but she never showed up.

12:01.873 --> 12:03.990
We were doing better.

12:03.992 --> 12:07.060
We were talking,
not yelling.

12:07.062 --> 12:11.798
In fact, she was planning
on moving back in.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.267
You didn't think it was odd that she
missed your session?

12:14.269 --> 12:16.536
I just thought
she was getting cold feet.

12:16.538 --> 12:20.824
And that maybe
she still wanted to...

12:20.826 --> 12:23.460
Wanted to be with him.

12:24.779 --> 12:27.247
Your wife was
having an affair?

12:30.634 --> 12:32.886
Do you know
who he was?

12:32.888 --> 12:36.339
I asked her,
but she wouldn't tell me.

12:44.799 --> 12:46.466
Maybe our unsub
is killing cheaters.

12:46.468 --> 12:49.302
That would explain why he poses
them in the prayer position.

12:49.304 --> 12:50.854
Or he's just
gaining confidence.

12:50.856 --> 12:53.022
The first two women
were single, blond.

12:53.024 --> 12:55.442
Now he's moved on
to married ones with varying looks.

12:55.444 --> 12:56.926
He's either changing
his victimology

12:56.928 --> 12:58.995
or he knew that
the first two were unfaithful.

12:58.997 --> 13:00.864
Hey, Garcia.

13:00.866 --> 13:02.667
I was starting to feel
like the hottest people

13:02.674 --> 13:03.767
I know had left me at the altar,

13:03.768 --> 13:05.535
but now you're here to kiss me
with crime. What's up?

13:05.537 --> 13:08.404
We need to get the 411
on our last victim, Emma Coleman.

13:08.406 --> 13:10.473
She was supposedly
having an affair.

13:10.475 --> 13:12.125
Any frequently called men?

13:13.911 --> 13:16.946
Uh, Uncle Sam.
She was behind on her taxes.

13:16.948 --> 13:19.616
How about credit cards
used at a hotel?

13:22.336 --> 13:24.554
No. Mm. She looks like me.

13:24.556 --> 13:26.589
A lot of online shopping
and Indian takeout.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.791
Any suspicious texts?

13:28.793 --> 13:31.127
To her mother.
That's about it.

13:31.129 --> 13:32.461
All right, well,
send us a list

13:32.463 --> 13:34.180
of the 3 women she called
the most this month.

13:34.182 --> 13:35.073
Those are her BFFs.

13:35.098 --> 13:37.001
They'll know who she's
fooling around with.

13:37.002 --> 13:39.269
Got it.

14:26.150 --> 14:27.901
Hello?

14:29.904 --> 14:32.572
Molly?

14:53.711 --> 14:55.011
Stop!

14:55.013 --> 14:57.213
Aah! Stop!

14:57.215 --> 14:59.649
Aah! Oh! Oh!

14:59.651 --> 15:00.817
Uhh!

15:04.655 --> 15:06.222
Wallace...

15:09.109 --> 15:10.743
Please, Wallace, don't!

15:10.745 --> 15:14.030
Why are you doing this?!

15:14.032 --> 15:16.332
Wallace, stop!

15:16.334 --> 15:18.117
Wallace!

15:18.119 --> 15:19.568
Was she raped as well?

15:19.570 --> 15:22.038
Repeatedly. Multiple lacerations
to the genitalia.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.274
And one shot
through the heart.

15:24.276 --> 15:25.575
The perfect shot, too.

15:25.577 --> 15:27.076
What about the vomit
found at the crime scene?

15:27.078 --> 15:28.678
Are the results back yet?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.796
It was tinged
with blood.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.247
I'm still working
on the stomach.

15:31.249 --> 15:33.099
Is that from
repeated vomiting?

15:33.101 --> 15:34.384
Possibly.

15:40.057 --> 15:42.475
A tooth. Looks
like an incisor.

15:42.477 --> 15:43.759
She swallowed her own?

15:43.761 --> 15:46.813
She's not missing one.
This belongs to someone else.

15:52.453 --> 15:55.204
You think
this is gonna help, Wallace?

15:55.206 --> 15:57.290
Shut up!

15:57.292 --> 15:58.607
You can't hurt me.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.909
Too late.

15:59.911 --> 16:02.545
Just let me go.
I won't tell anyone.

16:02.547 --> 16:04.714
Shut up, Heather.

16:08.785 --> 16:11.638
No. No.

16:16.829 --> 16:20.451
Shh...

16:33.344 --> 16:35.445
Dinnertime.

16:44.255 --> 16:46.702
The M.E.'s report came back
from the first two vics.

16:46.703 --> 16:49.337
They also had skull fragments
and human remains

16:49.339 --> 16:50.588
in their systems.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.173
This woman looks nothing
like the last 3.

16:52.175 --> 16:54.008
The victim pool's
expanding.

16:54.010 --> 16:57.045
So I talked to Emma's best friend
and she knew the lover's name.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.097
Turns out he was
out of town for all of the kills

16:59.099 --> 17:00.331
and his alibi checks out.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.883
So he's not our killer.

17:01.885 --> 17:03.017
Guys, look.

17:03.019 --> 17:04.801
She choked
on something.

17:08.891 --> 17:11.759
Oh, jeez,
tell me that's hers.

17:11.761 --> 17:12.977
It's not.

17:12.979 --> 17:14.896
Well, the tongue's
still from the head region.

17:14.897 --> 17:16.196
But who's the source?

17:16.199 --> 17:17.698
He either has a job
working with dead bodies,

17:17.700 --> 17:20.134
or that's from his first victim
who we haven't found yet.

17:20.136 --> 17:21.234
If we stick with
the religious theory,

17:21.237 --> 17:22.954
it could be some
sort of communion.

17:22.955 --> 17:24.071
Body of Christ.

17:24.074 --> 17:25.156
If we can identify
this victim,

17:25.157 --> 17:26.858
it'll help lead us
to our unsub.

17:26.859 --> 17:27.909
Let's bag it
and run the DNA.

17:27.911 --> 17:30.328
We're ready to give
the profile.

17:32.214 --> 17:35.883
We believe that this unknown subject
is a white male in his early 30s.

17:35.885 --> 17:39.036
Initially he targeted
white, blond women in their 20s

17:39.038 --> 17:40.421
but is expanding
his victim pool.

17:40.423 --> 17:42.673
His M.O. is to rape
his victims

17:42.675 --> 17:44.225
and then shoot them
in the heart.

17:44.227 --> 17:48.513
At the disposal site,
he poses them as if they're praying.

17:48.515 --> 17:50.765
He's trying
to convey a message

17:50.767 --> 17:53.367
that only
he understands.

17:53.369 --> 17:55.353
Before he kills his victims,

17:55.355 --> 17:57.839
he forces the women
to consume human flesh.

17:57.841 --> 17:59.723
It's called
projected cannibalism.

17:59.725 --> 18:01.725
Typically cannibalism
is a willing choice,

18:01.727 --> 18:04.695
but the act of forcing someone
to engage in it is a form of torture.

18:04.697 --> 18:06.964
It tells us that
the unsub is sadistic

18:06.966 --> 18:08.666
and most likely delusional.

18:08.668 --> 18:10.084
The emergence
of those delusions

18:10.086 --> 18:11.586
would have caused
difficulties

18:11.588 --> 18:13.671
in his relationships
and jobs in the past.

18:13.673 --> 18:16.591
He may have been institutionalized
or locked up as a result.

18:16.593 --> 18:18.676
He sees himself
as an enforcer

18:18.678 --> 18:20.111
and is punishing these
women for their sins.

18:20.113 --> 18:23.097
He may have an overly
developed sense of morality

18:23.099 --> 18:26.551
and feels the need to
superimpose this on others.

18:26.553 --> 18:28.553
Our unsub could have shot
his victims anywhere,

18:28.555 --> 18:30.638
but he chose the heart, suggesting
that he's been hurt

18:30.640 --> 18:33.424
by somebody close to him
who's clearly the center of his rage.

18:33.426 --> 18:36.260
This is the comfort zone
our unsub is operating in.

18:36.262 --> 18:38.596
We should increase
police presence within this area.

18:38.598 --> 18:41.315
He's also devolving rapidly
and could resort to even more

18:41.317 --> 18:43.284
extreme measures
to punish his victims.

19:00.219 --> 19:02.253
Are you gonna tempt her?

19:03.388 --> 19:05.590
Are you?

19:10.646 --> 19:11.896
You know what's odd?

19:11.898 --> 19:13.998
Usually in cannibalism,
it's the visceral organs

19:14.000 --> 19:15.516
and the fleshy parts
being eaten.

19:15.518 --> 19:18.603
But this unsub is making the victims
eat exclusively from the head.

19:18.605 --> 19:19.904
Why?

19:19.906 --> 19:21.272
That may be symbolic.

19:21.274 --> 19:24.742
It's the one body part
a person cannot survive losing.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.444
All right, so why don't you two
keep looking into that,

19:26.446 --> 19:29.647
and then we can devise
a neighborhood canvass questionnaire,

19:29.649 --> 19:31.649
check for any attempted
break-ins in the area.

19:31.651 --> 19:33.618
Someone's practicing
for his new role.

19:33.620 --> 19:37.338
Look, rumor has it
Hotch is putting in for Strauss' job.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.657
See no evil,
hear no gossip.

19:39.659 --> 19:41.209
Oh, come on,
we see evil all day long.

19:41.211 --> 19:43.678
Rossi says if we want to know,
we gotta ask the big man himself.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.296
I've asked Garcia
to compile

19:45.298 --> 19:48.633
a list of break-ins in the area and
also a missing persons report.

19:52.504 --> 19:56.390
And yes, they did talk to me about
the section chief job.

19:56.392 --> 19:57.808
Do you want it?

19:57.810 --> 20:00.778
I know what I don't want
is an outsider coming in

20:00.780 --> 20:03.197
and questioning every move
that this team makes.

20:03.199 --> 20:06.317
I told them that
I'd think about it.

20:06.319 --> 20:09.036
So what happens if you accept?

20:09.038 --> 20:11.439
It means this would be
my last ca in the field,

20:11.441 --> 20:13.023
but nothing's been decided.

20:13.025 --> 20:14.858
And as soon as
I figure out what to do,

20:14.860 --> 20:17.745
you'll be the first to know.

20:17.747 --> 20:20.331
We just got a lead
on a parolee who fits the profile.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.582
We're going
to pick him up.

20:21.584 --> 20:23.084
All right, Rossi,
you and Morgan go check it out.

20:23.086 --> 20:25.720
The rest of us will go over
the victimology statements.

20:35.147 --> 20:37.315
You should have told me,
Heather.

20:37.317 --> 20:41.369
But, no, I had to find out
in the paper.

20:59.755 --> 21:01.455
Mom?

21:01.457 --> 21:02.906
What's wrong?

21:02.908 --> 21:05.743
I've left you a bunch of messages
and you never call me back.

21:05.745 --> 21:07.928
Every time
I don't call back,

21:07.930 --> 21:10.097
it doesn't mean that
there's something wrong.

21:10.099 --> 21:12.967
Well, the ladies at the hairdresser
told me that Heather's missing.

21:12.969 --> 21:14.135
What?

21:14.137 --> 21:16.304
What are you
talking about?

21:16.306 --> 21:18.723
She went away on business
and she hasn't come back.

21:18.725 --> 21:20.691
I'm sure it's
a misunderstanding.

21:20.693 --> 21:22.760
Wallace, please tell me...

21:22.762 --> 21:24.428
You haven't talked to her.

21:24.430 --> 21:26.931
Of course not, mom.

21:37.993 --> 21:40.944
Oh, God!
What is that?!

21:40.946 --> 21:42.747
What? What?

21:42.749 --> 21:45.166
Wallace, what's wrong
with you, honey?

21:45.168 --> 21:46.550
I got to go, Ma.

21:46.552 --> 21:47.951
I don't feel well.

21:47.953 --> 21:49.837
Liar!
Shut up!

21:50.889 --> 21:52.139
Wallace, are you ok?

21:52.141 --> 21:54.759
No, he's sick.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.927
Let me in. Let me
make you something to eat.

21:56.929 --> 22:00.314
It's ok.
I got to go, ma.

22:00.316 --> 22:02.850
I got to go.
I got a shift in an hour.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.685
Wallace, please!
No, please!

22:05.637 --> 22:08.122
All right.
Thanks, Morgan.

22:08.124 --> 22:10.991
So, that parolee
the sergeant had a lead on

22:10.993 --> 22:12.643
turned out
to be a bust.

22:12.645 --> 22:14.812
What do you think
about Hotch?

22:14.814 --> 22:16.146
I think it sucks.

22:16.148 --> 22:17.298
What do we do?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.599
Uh, nothing.

22:18.601 --> 22:20.835
What do you mean, nothing?
I don't want him to leave.

22:20.837 --> 22:22.703
At least he'll
still be around.

22:22.705 --> 22:24.872
Yeah, with his name
on our reports.

22:24.874 --> 22:27.825
Look, I'm sure it's been hard
for him on the road.

22:27.827 --> 22:28.992
He's not going
to admit it,

22:28.994 --> 22:30.961
but a desk job would
be easier on Jack.

22:30.963 --> 22:32.530
He'll suffocate.

22:32.532 --> 22:34.014
You don't get it.

22:34.016 --> 22:37.635
Why? Because
I don't have kids?

22:37.637 --> 22:39.603
I would have.

22:39.605 --> 22:42.356
Spence...
You still will.

22:42.358 --> 22:44.508
Dr. Reid, the M.E.
just emailed this over.

22:46.812 --> 22:48.779
See?

22:48.781 --> 22:51.532
I'm sure he just
misses that.

22:51.534 --> 22:53.317
I'm gonna eat you up!

22:53.319 --> 22:55.152
Eat you up!

22:55.154 --> 22:56.654
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:56.656 --> 22:58.706
That's it.

22:59.791 --> 23:01.625
That's it.

23:01.627 --> 23:03.661
What?

23:04.629 --> 23:06.297
Guys, I think
I figured out

23:06.299 --> 23:08.365
why our unsub's obsessed
with the human head.

23:08.367 --> 23:09.717
The DNA reports
are back in.

23:09.719 --> 23:11.752
All of the human remains
found in the victims' stomachs

23:11.754 --> 23:13.204
are from
the same person.

23:13.206 --> 23:15.205
So what does
that mean?

23:15.207 --> 23:17.641
It's a long explanation,
so bear with me.

23:17.643 --> 23:19.660
When Pheidippides ran
a marathon, he had faith.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.212
He also died.
Go on.

23:21.214 --> 23:23.431
True. If you take the fact
that our unsub performs

23:23.433 --> 23:24.899
forced sexual acts
with his victims,

23:24.901 --> 23:27.067
then add to that the force-feeding
of a human head

23:27.069 --> 23:28.552
and the posed prayer
position,

23:28.554 --> 23:29.904
I know this sounds crazy,

23:29.906 --> 23:33.491
but I think our unsub is obsessed
with the praying mantis.

23:45.787 --> 23:49.039
That also explains why he
poses the victims' hands like this

23:49.041 --> 23:50.374
instead of like this.

23:50.376 --> 23:53.594
The praying mantis can
kill any of a multitude of creatures,

23:53.596 --> 23:56.430
but the most interesting fact is
that oftentimes the female mantis

23:56.432 --> 23:58.132
engages in sexual
cannibalism, meaning

23:58.134 --> 24:00.601
she'll bite off the head of her mate
once copulation is complete,

24:00.603 --> 24:03.587
sometimes even during
intercourse, actually.

24:03.589 --> 24:06.590
So that's what someone
did to our unsub.

24:06.592 --> 24:08.392
It also explains why he shoots
his victims through the heart.

24:08.394 --> 24:11.946
But the center of our unsub's
anger didn't bite off his head.

24:11.948 --> 24:14.064
No, but she hurt him so badly
that she got into his brain.

24:14.066 --> 24:16.317
So he's flipping
the script.

24:16.319 --> 24:17.768
He's completely taking it over.

24:17.770 --> 24:19.653
He basically sees the victims
as the praying mantis

24:19.655 --> 24:20.871
out to destroy him,

24:20.873 --> 24:22.406
so before they can
get to him, he rapes them,

24:22.408 --> 24:23.791
forces them
to engage in cannibalism,

24:23.793 --> 24:25.292
thereby taking away
their control of the situation.

24:25.294 --> 24:27.277
He's essentially
walking them through

24:27.279 --> 24:29.263
the mating behavior
of a captive praying mantis,

24:29.265 --> 24:31.048
only entirely on his terms.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.666
He even mirrors the
decapitation of the insect

24:32.668 --> 24:34.251
by forcing them to eat
pieces of a human head,

24:34.253 --> 24:37.955
only it's not a male human head,
it's a female human head.

24:37.957 --> 24:39.890
The woman that's
the core of his rage.

24:39.892 --> 24:41.809
Exactly. Now all women
are his enemy.

24:41.811 --> 24:45.229
They're his predators, and he
believes they're out to get him.

24:59.978 --> 25:02.813
Hey, Wallace.

25:09.654 --> 25:11.672
Get away from me.

25:13.959 --> 25:16.493
Get away from me!

25:18.329 --> 25:21.048
Get away from me!

25:35.036 --> 25:37.671
Garcia, how are we doing
on the missing persons reports?

25:37.673 --> 25:39.255
There are 6 women
that have gone missing

25:39.257 --> 25:41.541
in the Glendale area
in the last month.

25:41.543 --> 25:43.493
Any of them from within
the comfort zone?

25:43.495 --> 25:47.380
One, but she's a kid
in the middle of a custody battle.

25:47.382 --> 25:50.133
What about
surrounding areas?

25:50.135 --> 25:51.468
That adds 8 women.

25:51.470 --> 25:54.721
See if any of them have
any connections to the area.

25:57.024 --> 26:00.694
There's one lady, Heather Clarke,
from Phoenix, Arizona.

26:00.696 --> 26:02.946
She went to school
in the area 15 years ago.

26:02.948 --> 26:04.147
She fits the age.

26:04.149 --> 26:06.149
And here's a thing--

26:06.151 --> 26:09.235
uh, she went missing
two weeks ago,

26:09.237 --> 26:11.521
and 6 days prior
to her missingness-ness-ness,

26:11.523 --> 26:14.290
it was announced in the paper
she was to be married.

26:16.711 --> 26:19.362
Unsub must have seen that
and it triggered his anger.

26:19.364 --> 26:22.999
That would explain why he threw
away the third victim's wedding ring.

26:24.502 --> 26:28.088
Guys, Heather has
a DNA sample on file.

26:28.090 --> 26:29.372
All right, pull that
and let's compare it

26:29.374 --> 26:32.559
to the tooth we found
in the latest victim's body.

27:20.357 --> 27:22.425
Heather...

27:22.427 --> 27:24.027
What are you doing?

27:24.029 --> 27:26.262
I'm not leaving,
Wallace.

27:26.264 --> 27:28.031
Shut up.

27:28.033 --> 27:29.816
Shut up!

27:31.953 --> 27:34.821
I'm not going to tell you again--
get out!

27:41.378 --> 27:42.945
I would have
left him for you.

27:42.947 --> 27:45.781
Liar!

27:45.783 --> 27:47.584
Why don't you believe me?

27:47.586 --> 27:51.788
Because you lied to me!
You never loved me!

27:51.790 --> 27:54.123
Yes, I did, Wallace.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.291
No!

27:55.293 --> 27:57.677
I loved you, Wallace.

27:57.679 --> 27:59.579
Stop lying!

28:01.999 --> 28:03.149
I loved you.

28:11.141 --> 28:13.009
Don't hurt me.

28:13.011 --> 28:14.644
Uhh!

28:14.646 --> 28:15.612
I loved you.

28:15.614 --> 28:18.314
I loved you.
I loved you.

28:18.316 --> 28:21.451
I loved you!

28:45.943 --> 28:47.443
What's going on?

28:47.445 --> 28:48.895
Nothing.

28:48.897 --> 28:51.397
I heard you screaming.
I can't concentrate.

28:51.399 --> 28:53.449
Then move.

28:53.451 --> 28:55.151
What did you say?

28:55.153 --> 28:56.903
I said move!

28:56.905 --> 28:58.187
Because the next
time you knock on my door

28:58.189 --> 29:00.790
will be the last
time you come up those steps.

29:02.910 --> 29:06.963
Heather's DNA sample matches
the tooth found in our victim's stomach.

29:08.332 --> 29:09.883
Garcia, Heather Clarke
is the victim

29:09.885 --> 29:11.551
that our unsub's been
feeding to the others.

29:11.553 --> 29:12.669
Yikes.

29:12.671 --> 29:13.970
See if she has
any enemies.

29:13.972 --> 29:17.257
No. She was her company's
top regional manager.

29:17.259 --> 29:19.309
She--she looks loved.

29:19.311 --> 29:22.478
Well, the unsub's rage has
probably been brewing for a long time.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.814
And he most likely
expressed his disdain for her

29:24.816 --> 29:26.065
long before he killed her.

29:26.067 --> 29:30.019
Baby girl, check middle
and high school records.

29:30.021 --> 29:32.488
No, zero, zero.
There's nothing there.

29:32.490 --> 29:34.490
There's got to be
something.

29:34.492 --> 29:37.527
See if her parents ever
filed a restraining order.

29:39.513 --> 29:40.947
Oh, creepy bingo.

29:40.949 --> 29:43.816
When Heather was 16, she broke up
with a guy named Wallace Hines.

29:43.818 --> 29:45.702
Wallace did not take
the breaking up well.

29:45.704 --> 29:47.870
He went into an emo
downward spiral.

29:47.872 --> 29:49.905
Heather!

29:52.543 --> 29:54.661
Heather!

29:57.598 --> 30:00.466
Heather!

30:05.522 --> 30:07.307
What happened
to Wallace?

30:07.309 --> 30:08.975
He was hospitalized.

30:08.977 --> 30:11.811
It's ok.
Everything is gonna be ok.

30:11.813 --> 30:14.364
In fact, he's been in and out
of institutions for over a decade.

30:14.366 --> 30:16.733
He suffers from acute
delusional disorder.

30:16.735 --> 30:18.301
Where is he now?

30:18.303 --> 30:20.320
He was living with his mom
until very recently.

30:20.322 --> 30:22.271
He moved two miles
away from her,

30:22.273 --> 30:25.491
right smack in the middle
of the hunting zone.

30:25.493 --> 30:27.877
So Wallace killed Heather,
and when that didn't alleviate his rage,

30:27.879 --> 30:29.329
he began killing
other women.

30:29.331 --> 30:30.797
Send us both
addresses.

30:30.799 --> 30:33.583
Blake, you and Reid
notify Heather's parents.

31:02.696 --> 31:04.364
Wallace Hines!

31:15.509 --> 31:18.494
Wallace, you're late.

31:18.496 --> 31:20.380
I forgot my bag.

31:20.382 --> 31:22.348
We got a bridal shower
and a bridge club lunch.

31:22.350 --> 31:24.166
Did you forget
how to cook, too?

31:24.168 --> 31:25.802
No.

31:25.804 --> 31:28.554
Then go get changed.
We got food to make.

31:32.943 --> 31:35.478
His old bedroom was
full of pictures of Heather,

31:35.480 --> 31:37.814
but he's cut the heads off
of all of them.

31:37.816 --> 31:39.682
What the hell is going on?

31:39.684 --> 31:41.150
I'm Agent Hotchner
with the FBI.

31:41.152 --> 31:43.286
We're looking
for your son.

31:43.288 --> 31:44.871
Why? Is he in trouble?

31:44.873 --> 31:46.155
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

31:46.157 --> 31:49.859
Uh, he left me a message.
He, um...

31:49.861 --> 31:52.295
Said he was sorry.

31:52.297 --> 31:54.814
Did he say
where he was going?

31:56.700 --> 31:58.968
What did he do?

32:03.807 --> 32:07.060
Wallace, there was
supposed to be bacon on this, man.

32:07.062 --> 32:09.429
No problem.

32:20.223 --> 32:22.942
There you go.

32:33.754 --> 32:36.172
Hey, I got something.

32:36.174 --> 32:38.624
He works at Wheeler's.

32:43.747 --> 32:46.966
This doesn't taste right.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.474
Good afternoon, ladies.

32:58.446 --> 33:00.930
Time to eat.

33:16.246 --> 33:18.614
Eat.

33:24.462 --> 33:25.513
Wallace...

33:25.515 --> 33:27.631
What are you doing?

33:27.633 --> 33:29.934
Just put the gun down.

33:29.936 --> 33:32.320
I can't do that.

33:32.322 --> 33:35.106
These people didn't
do anything to you.

33:35.108 --> 33:38.142
No, she hurt me...

33:38.144 --> 33:40.495
Then she ate me.

33:40.497 --> 33:42.196
Please.

33:42.198 --> 33:44.866
Oh, here we go.

33:44.868 --> 33:47.084
You hurt me!

33:47.086 --> 33:49.153
What is he
talking about?

33:49.155 --> 33:51.706
You know what
I'm talking about!

33:51.708 --> 33:54.242
You hurt me
and then you ate me.

33:54.244 --> 33:57.378
Is that what I did,
Wallace?

33:57.380 --> 33:59.497
Shut up.

33:59.499 --> 34:01.432
Shut up!

34:01.434 --> 34:05.503
Wallace, these people
didn't do anything to you.

34:05.505 --> 34:08.005
No, I did.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.110
You hurt me!

34:14.112 --> 34:16.147
Damn right I did!

34:16.149 --> 34:17.864
Stop it!

34:17.867 --> 34:20.284
Stop it!

34:20.286 --> 34:21.402
Come on, Wallace.

34:21.404 --> 34:23.821
You know I loved you.

34:26.725 --> 34:29.327
Just do it.

34:29.329 --> 34:31.027
Do it!

34:34.132 --> 34:37.083
Come on, Wallace.

34:42.056 --> 34:44.475
Hey! Drop the gun.

34:44.476 --> 34:46.010
Drop it!

34:53.569 --> 34:55.101
Aah!

35:06.582 --> 35:08.082
Where is he?

35:08.084 --> 35:10.368
Through the kitchen.

35:51.076 --> 35:53.277
We're at the east end
of the garage. We don't have him.

35:53.279 --> 35:54.779
Our suspect
is on the loose.

35:54.781 --> 35:57.281
I want an APB
put out to all our officers

35:57.283 --> 35:59.650
in neighboring
jurisdictions.

36:03.288 --> 36:04.955
Anything?

36:09.228 --> 36:11.262
All units, all units--

36:11.264 --> 36:13.364
we have an APB
on a Wallace Hines

36:13.366 --> 36:14.849
wanted in a shooting
at Wheeler's restaurant.

36:14.851 --> 36:17.468
He is armed and dangerous.

36:36.155 --> 36:38.839
5-5-David, I just saw armed suspect
going south down holden.

36:38.841 --> 36:40.424
He's in a dark Ford
Taurus, turning right

36:40.426 --> 36:41.759
on Washington
near Holden.

36:41.761 --> 36:43.594
That's right
near us.

36:43.596 --> 36:46.330
We're approaching
that location from the north.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.020
That's it. That's him.

36:53.022 --> 36:55.106
In pursuit
of a black Ford Taurus

36:55.108 --> 36:58.676
going westbound
on Washington, crossing State.

36:58.678 --> 37:02.863
Arizona license plate
52B7HN.

37:28.673 --> 37:30.091
Hold on.

37:34.063 --> 37:36.397
Morgan!

37:42.604 --> 37:44.605
Get out of the car!

37:44.607 --> 37:46.390
Now!

37:48.393 --> 37:49.777
Get out of the car.

37:49.779 --> 37:52.613
Slowly.

37:54.666 --> 37:56.400
Turn around.

37:58.086 --> 38:01.172
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:01.174 --> 38:03.063
Anything you say
can and will be used

38:03.064 --> 38:04.264
against you in a court of law.

38:04.761 --> 38:06.243
You have the right
to an attorney.

38:06.245 --> 38:07.878
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

38:07.880 --> 38:10.097
one will be
appointed to you.

38:22.277 --> 38:25.095
So, uh, any news
on the job front?

38:25.097 --> 38:27.931
No, but they said
that they wanted

38:27.933 --> 38:31.652
to talk to me again
when we got back.

38:31.654 --> 38:34.538
I've thought a lot about it.

38:34.540 --> 38:37.541
I don't know
what to tell them.

38:37.543 --> 38:42.446
Well, I can think of a million ways
to sabotage you.

38:42.448 --> 38:44.465
Just say the word.

38:50.338 --> 38:52.256
Hey, what's wrong?

38:52.258 --> 38:54.958
For two people who
made a big arrest,

38:54.960 --> 38:56.544
you look pretty unsettled.

38:56.546 --> 38:59.814
Something was off
about Wallace.

38:59.816 --> 39:01.348
The--the restaurant
shooting

39:01.350 --> 39:03.684
was so chaotic
and disorganized.

39:03.686 --> 39:05.820
Yeah, it was.

39:05.822 --> 39:08.405
But when we arrested him...

39:08.407 --> 39:10.974
He was controlled.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.828
He was together.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.312
Well, Richard Farley

39:15.314 --> 39:17.648
was like that
after his rampage.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.650
Yeah,
so was Edward Tallaway.

39:19.652 --> 39:22.586
Everyone has
a different reaction to being caught.

39:22.588 --> 39:25.155
You guys did good.

39:42.557 --> 39:45.309
Hey, Sarge,
look at this.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.984
Hotchner.

39:53.986 --> 39:55.703
Yes.

39:56.938 --> 39:58.372
I'm sorry?

40:01.793 --> 40:03.294
Thank you.

40:04.963 --> 40:07.197
We got the wrong guy.

40:07.199 --> 40:08.699
What?

40:09.867 --> 40:11.952
The fingerprints
at the restaurant don't match.

40:11.954 --> 40:13.938
Hotch, how is that possible?

40:28.070 --> 40:30.220
We're now going
to bring you news.

40:30.222 --> 40:32.072
Let's go to our reporter
on the scene.

40:32.074 --> 40:34.891
We're here at the corner
of Washington and Market,

40:34.893 --> 40:39.280
where Wallace Hines was arrested
for a shooting at Wheeler's earlier today.

40:39.282 --> 40:41.282
He's also suspected
in the murders

40:41.284 --> 40:44.118
of at least 5 other women
in the Glendale area,

40:44.120 --> 40:46.804
and residents are relieved
he is in custody.

40:46.806 --> 40:48.272
Stay tuned
for further updates.

40:48.274 --> 40:52.293
Hey. You gonna
buy that or what?

40:52.295 --> 40:53.928
Josh Billings
