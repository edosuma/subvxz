WEBVTT

01:41.518 --> 01:44.645
I can't tell you where we are,
frankly, for our own safety.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.398
Systematically,
we have seen journalists attacked.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.610
We would like to be showing you,
instead of this strange image of me

01:50.694 --> 01:53.780
sitting on the floor
of an undisclosed location in dim lighting,

01:53.864 --> 01:55.782
we would like to be showing you pictures,

01:55.866 --> 02:00.036
live pictures, of what's happening
in Tahrir Square right now,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.830
but we can't do that
because our cameras have been taken down.

02:02.915 --> 02:06.209
Physically, Elliot, when you say
your cameras have been taken down?

02:06.293 --> 02:10.463
Through threats, and intimidation,
and through actual, physical attacks.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.549
We're looking at Al Jazeera feed
from about six hours ago.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.134
Can you describe what we're seeing?

02:15.219 --> 02:17.303
He can't describe anything except his room.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.721
Ask him what's in the minibar.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.556
I'd like it if you settled down.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.141
Then I think you're gonna be disappointed.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.311
And that was roughly 7:00 p.m. In Cairo.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.481
- Elliot?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Will.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.649
Elliot, can you...

02:29.733 --> 02:31.984
There's gunfire coming
from below our hotel room.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.361
- Where's he going?
- Out on the balcony.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.779
- Get back on the air.
- Do we still have Elliot?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.864
- Take it.
- God damn it!

02:36.949 --> 02:39.450
If you're just joining us,
with dawn about to break in Cairo,

02:39.535 --> 02:42.912
a crowd estimated at over 100,000 people
gathered several hours ago

02:42.996 --> 02:44.664
in Tahrir Square in the Egyptian capital...

02:44.748 --> 02:46.666
Get back on the fucking air.

02:46.750 --> 02:51.462
...Mubarak resign after 18 days
of unprecedented pro-democracy protests.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.256
How long's he gonna be on the balcony?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.382
...the vast majority of the Egyptian people,

02:54.466 --> 02:56.926
the resignation was expected
by President Obama,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.847
French President Nicolas Sarkozy,
and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.765
But in a 17-minute address,

03:02.850 --> 03:05.351
Mubarak announced
that he wouldn't be stepping down,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.771
infuriating the crowd,
which appears to have grown larger

03:08.856 --> 03:11.858
and angrier
throughout this extraordinary night.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.777
We're speaking with our own Elliot Hirsch,
who, like all foreign journalists...

03:14.862 --> 03:17.864
No, Elliot's on the balcony
singing a song from Evita.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.407
...at an undisclosed location.
- He's back.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.576
- Pardon me, Will.
- Yeah. Is everything all right?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.786
That was gunfire.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.957
It doesn't appear that anyone's been injured,
but it is a little hard to tell from where I am.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.376
We're looking at a feed
from six hours ago, Elliot.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.628
Can you describe what's happening
in the Square right now?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.715
The crowd is surging and spreading.

03:35.799 --> 03:39.135
The army has made a ring
around Tahrir Square.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.761
Oh, God, are you all right?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.389
It's a glass door.
You can't see me standing here?

03:43.473 --> 03:44.765
Yeah, be quiet. There's a new story.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.477
We're getting footage of a protest
that's forming in Appleton, Wisconsin.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.271
The governor's
inside a newspaper office there,

03:50.355 --> 03:53.566
and a spontaneous protest of teachers
is happening outside the building right now.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.742
Yep, go.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.076
Call the edit bay
and tell them what's happening.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.078
Will, we're gonna push the commercial break.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.873
A small protest broke out
in front of a newspaper office

04:08.957 --> 04:12.501
where Scott Walker is right now.
So we're cutting the feed.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.587
Tap your pen if you understand.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.048
And now the protests
are spreading out from Tahrir?

04:19.676 --> 04:20.801
- I'm already on it.
- Which one?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.929
- The teachers in Wisconsin.
- That's me.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.722
- What's going on?
- The governor of Wisconsin

04:24.806 --> 04:27.433
is pushing a bill through the legislature
to balance the state budget

04:27.517 --> 04:29.936
by busting public sector unions,
especially teachers,

04:30.020 --> 04:31.854
and strip their collective bargaining rights.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.691
The governor is trapped in a newspaper office
with 75 teachers protesting outside,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.068
and by tomorrow, it'll be 10,000.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.862
Yes, but in the meantime, some Egyptians
are about to overthrow Egypt.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.739
- Is there anyone else here?
- Nope.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.283
Okay. We got two packages to cut
and only one editor.

04:44.368 --> 04:48.579
Cory, if I promise I understand the irony,
can I break union rules and sit at this bay?

04:48.664 --> 04:50.748
Will you talk to someone
about hiring more editors?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.583
Talk is all I can promise. But I'm on your side.

04:52.668 --> 04:53.876
Go ahead.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.003
- Where do you want to start?
- It's around 12:20.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.714
He starts the answer with,
"We have, in state government..."

04:58.799 --> 05:01.968
- We have, in state government...
- Right there.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.553
Before I'd taken office,
plans for contingencies

05:04.638 --> 05:07.598
no matter what the circumstances.
We have updated those.

05:07.683 --> 05:11.227
I've had a full briefing
from all the major level-one state agencies

05:11.311 --> 05:12.812
as well as the National Guard yesterday.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.938
- Cut it there.
- Cut it there.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.189
Pay attention to your thing.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.692
Right there where the teachers are chanting.

05:17.776 --> 05:21.904
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
selfish Scott has got to go.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.198
Cut it there. That's the package. Render it.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.452
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.079
I'm about to have
my Bpradcast News moment.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.999
There are at least nine things between here
and the control room I can trip over.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.959
It's 2011.
We don't move film manually anymore.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.794
You're gonna have to move this manually.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.254
It's taking too long
to render both at the same time.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.755
- Grab a thumb drive.
- Can I use a thumb drive?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
- Throw it in the USB.
- Put it in the USB.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.633
- Copy the raw file to the drive.
- Copy the raw file,

05:42.718 --> 05:44.593
- and I'll take it down to control?
- Run it to the control room.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.929
I'm right behind you.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.850
So as we mentioned, there are thousands
currently outside of state TW and parliament

05:50.934 --> 05:53.060
and a call for 25...

05:53.145 --> 05:55.521
There's a group of protesters
headed toward Heliopolis.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.856
Ask him if he knows anything

05:56.940 --> 06:00.026
about the protesters
heading towards the presidential palace.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.902
We're getting information about protesters

06:01.987 --> 06:04.447
heading towards the presidential palace
in Heliopolis.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.157
I don't know anything about that.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.868
- 'Cause you're in the Cairo Radisson.
- Does he look happy about that?

06:08.952 --> 06:12.038
It's hard for me to tell from the incredibly
high-resolution pictures we're getting.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.247
I'm as frustrated as you are, Don,

06:13.331 --> 06:15.875
but I'm not sending an American journalist
into that protest.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.710
Trust me.
I'm an American journalist.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.671
That's the Walker press conference
and the teachers in Appleton unrendered.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.591
- Got it.
- I didn't trip over anything on the way.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.717
Oh!

06:24.801 --> 06:27.636
- Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.472
- Sorry.
- Raw file?

06:30.432 --> 06:32.475
Let's pivot now.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.560
All right, Elliot Hirsch reporting from Cairo.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.395
- We'll be coming back to you, Elliot.
- Why?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.522
...an unexpected move by Mubarak...

06:38.899 --> 06:39.899
Where are you going?

06:39.983 --> 06:42.068
I'm gonna find someone who's on the ground.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.445
What is shocking is to hear
an American governor

06:44.529 --> 06:46.322
threaten to call up the National Guard.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.074
But that's just what Scott Walker,

06:48.158 --> 06:51.118
the commander in chief
of the Wisconsin National Guard, did today

06:51.203 --> 06:53.621
in defending
his Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.624
Anyone with "producer" in their title,
conference room.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.584
- Sloan.
- I'm not a producer.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.794
I need you.
Can you wait a minute?

06:59.878 --> 07:01.003
I was this close.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.130
You know I'd have had
security stop you downstairs.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.507
- I know.
- I'll be just a couple of minutes.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.802
Okay, but sometimes you ask me to wait,
and then you forget that you did,

07:07.886 --> 07:10.262
and you call me from home at 11:00
and say sorry.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.931
- How many times has that happened?
- Twice.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.266
Well, I really was sorry.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.102
I'll sit and watch TV.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.353
Does anyone know where there's a TV?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.481
- Honey, I'm sorry. I need 20 minutes.
- I can see.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.025
- Is Egypt still a country?
- Yeah, it's just a new one.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.611
I happen to be an Egyptologist
if you want me on tomorrow.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.321
Since when are you an Egyptologist?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.697
I can be one by tomorrow.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.950
Go to Hang Chews, get a drink,
and I'll meet you there.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.201
Yes, boss.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.454
- Herb.
- Yes, ma'am?

07:35.539 --> 07:38.749
We were 17 seconds heavy on Bernanke,
which meant we had to squeeze...

07:38.834 --> 07:41.877
- Wait, wait. Everybody watch this.
- There's nothing to watch.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.046
- She has to subtract with her fingers.
- I don't have to.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.298
We were 17 seconds heavy on Bernanke,

07:46.383 --> 07:49.218
which means we had
to squeeze Bill Kristol down to what?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.181
2:13.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.976
And Will took tap dancing lessons
when he was 11.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.188
And MacKenzie thought This Old House
was working on the same house every week.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.440
Everyone in the conference room.
And that was reasonable.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.276
It took six months to build the city of Dubai.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.362
You think they were renovating
the same mid-century colonial for 15 years?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.488
Let's go.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.115
How many kitchens
did you think that house had?

08:11.449 --> 08:13.409
That'll do. Let's get serious.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.787
I'll begin by saying that Will cries
when he watches the movie Rudy.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.956
- No, I don't.
- Cries like an onion.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.334
Onions make you cry.
They don't themselves experience emotion.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.378
The way you experience emotion
when you watch Rudy.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.172
One scene, one moment, once in a while.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.506
- The jersey scene?
- Yes.

08:27.591 --> 08:28.841
Everybody cries at the jersey scene.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.634
- Jim?
- I never saw it.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.261
- You haven't seen Rudy?
- Uh-oh.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.680
What were you doing when everyone else
your age was living their lives?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.974
- My homework.
- "My homework."

08:39.269 --> 08:42.521
I didn't think I'd be the only one to say that.
I thought I'd have the safety of a mob.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.899
Listen up, 'cause it's
Rudy's last chance to dress for a game.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.026
- I shouldn't have started this.
- Well, you did.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.528
NCAA rules only allow a certain number
of players to be in uniform.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.989
And every time the list goes up,
Rudy's name is left off it.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.201
And the list for the last game goes up,
and Rudy's name is left off it again.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.702
Four years of futility.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.370
First, he's gotta make the grades
to get in to the school.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.622
Then he's got to make the practice squad.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.707
And he's getting creamed
by guys twice his size.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.626
But he doesn't care,
because it's all about the team.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.087
And all he wants is to just once
to be on the list to dress for a game.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.174
And it's the last game of his last year
of college, and he's not on the list.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.717
- So one by one...
- Here it is.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.095
...the players come to the coach's office
and put their jerseys down on the desk.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.224
- And say, "Coach..."
- "I want to take a shower with Rudy."

09:18.683 --> 09:20.392
No, they don't.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.062
They walk in one by one,
put their jerseys on the desk,

09:23.146 --> 09:25.940
and say, "Coach, I want Rudy
to take my place on Saturday."

09:26.024 --> 09:29.485
And there's a whole line
snaking out of the coach's office

09:29.569 --> 09:31.237
of players holding their jerseys.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.697
- Jim, your forehead is bleeding.
- It is.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.200
- I accidentally hit him with a door.
- Twice.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.577
Move your hair out of the way.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.663
- It is bleeding.
- Could you grab the first aid kit?

09:40.747 --> 09:41.872
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.415
- Where's Don?
- I don't know.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.459
I saw him slip out after Elliot's segment.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.919
Well, that's what
I want to talk about.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.256
We're 18 days into this, and I'm sick
of pulling pool feed from the wires.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.840
I've seen the same footage we're using

09:51.925 --> 09:54.260
licensed to NBC three times
in the last two hours.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.970
Nilesat keeps popping on and off.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.472
And mostly,
we can't cover this from a hotel room.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.016
- We need someone on the ground.
- It's too dangerous on the ground.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.977
- For an American.
- You want to get a stringer?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.770
Someone local.
Someone who can blend in with the crowd.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.314
Someone who's credible
with both us and the protesters.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.943
And someone who can shoot,
and cut, and knows to check audio.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.028
You live on the Internet.
Have you been tracking anyone?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.154
I absolutely have the guy.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.494
Excuse us.

10:28.044 --> 10:32.589
Do you know what you're... Ow.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.924
Do you know what you're doing? Ow.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.136
- I could have been a doctor.
- What happened?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.138
Well, I didn't go to medical school
or anything.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.389
Okay.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.143
It's another TMI! Story,
and it'll be picked up by Page Six.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.437
- How many different ways...
- It's online today and in print tomorrow.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.981
How many different ways do I have to say
I'm not gonna play on that court?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.150
- We have to engage this time.
- What does it say?

10:51.234 --> 10:52.401
Did you know that your boy...

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
Did you know that Wade Campbell
is thinking about running for Congress?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.614
Yeah, he's thinking about it,
but not more than that.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.826
Yes, more than that. He's had meetings
with senior staff of the DCCC.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.828
They're recruiting him
for Anthony Weiner's seat.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.747
Anthony Weiner's
keeping Anthony Weiner's seat.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.333
- Not if he runs for mayor.
- I didn't know that.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.335
You've had Wade on the show
five times in six weeks.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.502
What's this story gonna be?

11:10.587 --> 11:13.547
It's gonna be that you're trying
to get your boyfriend elected to Congress.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.591
What do you think it's gonna be?

11:17.719 --> 11:20.512
When you put it like that, I can see that
that's what it could look like, but...

11:20.597 --> 11:22.890
- That's what it does look like.
- He won't be on the show anymore.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.268
Guys, according
to Google Trends Volume Index,

11:26.353 --> 11:29.146
since New Year's Eve,
the search term "Will McAvoy"

11:29.230 --> 11:32.900
has spiked 35 times its average frequency
over the last three years.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.945
In less than six weeks, there have been
nine negative mentions in Page Six and TMI!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.989
How many of their readers
do you think are our viewers?

11:39.074 --> 11:42.743
Those articles have been referenced
or backlinked in over 800,000 websites.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.161
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.287
There are 800,000 websites?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.664
It's a daily distraction
from what we're trying to do here.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.334
- First, it was Will's dating disasters.
- I'm a great date.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.045
Now, we're playing it fast and loose
with ethics.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.005
That's only what it looks like.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.548
What else matters?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.759
We're getting eaten alive
by our own tabloid life.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.345
Come on, chief, it's Mac.
She's annoyingly ethical.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.598
- Thank you.
- Well, congratulations.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.810
You're now a boldfaced name. You're in play.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.187
- Anything you do...
- I understand.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.440
Come on.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.196
How did you not know he was talking...

12:19.280 --> 12:22.282
He never told me.
You can't think I used you to raise his profile.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.742
I know for sure you didn't use me.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.496
He used me.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.001
Hey, you know what? Seriously.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.087
Don't assume anything.
He seems like a good guy.

12:38.216 --> 12:41.927
Plus, nobody in his right mind
would risk losing you.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.345
Come on.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.685
Who's the stringer you've got?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.645
I've been following
his Twitter feed and YouTube posts.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.106
- He goes by the name Amen.
- A-M-E-N?

12:54.190 --> 12:55.649
- Like praise the Lord?
- That's how it's spelled.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.860
But it means "the hidden one"
in ancient Egyptian.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.945
He's got a following including Richard Engel

13:00.029 --> 13:04.032
who says he's solid, straightforward,
and fearless in the face of all the chaos.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.409
It's a nice endorsement from Engel,

13:05.493 --> 13:06.952
but I don't know
about using someone I don't know.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.871
I know him. He's just like me.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.873
- He is me.
- What do you mean?

13:13.209 --> 13:16.336
Our fathers were both mechanics.
Not because it was their dream job,

13:16.421 --> 13:19.173
but because they knew
there was always work for mechanics.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.632
- Neal.
- We're both the eldest son

13:20.717 --> 13:24.303
and have been taking care of our siblings
for most our lives.

13:24.387 --> 13:29.641
Neither of us will ever get a college degree.
We're both idealistic about the Internet.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.768
Keep talking.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.651
- I was on one of the trains.
- 7/7?

13:42.780 --> 13:47.993
I was going to visit my aunt,
and the train had just left Liverpool Street,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.496
and I was half asleep
when the bomb exploded.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.747
What did you see?

13:53.374 --> 13:57.753
The car filled with smoke,
people screaming, crying.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.884
Praying.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.888
Finally, an Underground worker
in an orange vest got to us

14:07.972 --> 14:10.307
and started leading us
up the tunnel into King's Cross.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.142
And I pulled my cell phone out to call my dad.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.353
- There was no service.
- Right.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.939
- So you started filming it instead.
- Yeah.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.192
And I got out,

14:20.276 --> 14:22.903
and, you know, I uploaded it,
and I sent it to the news stations.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.198
You knew then
you weren't going to be a mechanic.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.699
- Yeah.
- He's Rudy.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.452
- Not everything is Rudy.
- I know not everything is Rudy.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.788
Forget it.
Some people just don't understand Rudy.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.791
Just me, and Rudy, and Neal,
and the guy Neal found in Cairo.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.084
- Amen.
- Thank you.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.878
No, his name is Amen.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.631
And you can trust him.
He's gonna come through.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.470
What kind of equipment does he have?

14:48.555 --> 14:51.515
A Kodak Zi8 HD handheld and a laptop.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.724
- You can find him?
- Yes.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.643
- How will we get the signal?
- Why can't he use our uplink?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.228
- We'd need him mobile.
- There's still the Internet.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.938
There's been no Internet since the 27th.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.398
Not from the four major ISPs,

14:59.482 --> 15:01.233
but there's a smaller provider
called the Noor Group,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.444
and their main client is the Egyptian
Stock Exchange. They can't shut that down.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.780
Are you saying
there's still working Internet in Egypt?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.740
Noor Group has 83 live routes

15:08.825 --> 15:11.660
with successful pings
on international inbound transit.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.289
Are you saying
there's still working Internet in Egypt?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.540
- Yes.
- Will.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.749
Yeah?

15:17.834 --> 15:20.043
- I need you to fill in at 10:00.
- What happened?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.005
Elliot left his hotel. He went down
to the street, and he got beaten up.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.173
What's his condition?

15:25.258 --> 15:28.427
He's got a couple broken ribs, a broken arm,
and cuts and bruises around his face.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.929
- He got beaten with a rock.
- Get him home.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.515
- That's happening.
- What the hell was he doing on the street?

15:34.517 --> 15:35.767
I'm gonna call his wife.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.144
- I'll do it.
- No.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.187
- Don.
- Charlie, let him do it.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.068
Right away, you say he's fine,
and he's on his way home.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.946
- Yeah.
- She doesn't need to know about the rock.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.449
What the hell was Elliot thinking?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.492
He was thinking, "Get the story."

15:56.205 --> 15:57.789
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.625
What are you still doing here?

15:59.709 --> 16:02.210
Right. Yes. Come with me.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.047
- I just heard about Elliot.
- He'll be okay.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.090
- You're sure?
- No internal injuries.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.425
Thank God.

16:08.509 --> 16:12.596
A few months ago, I agreed to appear
on a panel at the Paley Center called

16:12.680 --> 16:15.349
Is TV News Equipped to Cover the Economy?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.684
- Excellent subject.
- I think so, but here's the thing.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.479
I'm not equipped to cover the economy.
I don't know anything about economics.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.148
I'm sure they're not expecting you
to be an economist. You're a producer.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.193
Yeah, but what I'm saying is
I don't know anything about the economy.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.070
Nothing. I never studied it in school.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.073
I never read the business section.
I never reported economic news.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.574
You've been producing economic news.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.117
We've been doing five minutes a night
for months.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.245
Yeah, I just set aside a five-minute block
and let you and Will go at it.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.331
- You've been approving the subjects.
- I trust you.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.874
What does that mean?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.085
I pretend to read what you give me,
and then I nod.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.878
Okay, have you been listening
during the show?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.755
- I have been listening very closely.
- And?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.341
- I do not understand a word you're saying.
- Kenzie!

16:49.425 --> 16:51.635
Can we save the scolding, Thomas Friedman?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.512
- Do you mean Paul Krugman?
- Which one's the economist?

16:53.596 --> 16:54.888
- Paul Krugman.
- Then that's who I meant.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.016
I just need you to teach me
a couple of things to say

16:58.101 --> 17:00.227
that'll make it look like I know something.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.937
How long did it take you
to know what you know?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.690
College, grad school, doctorate,
post-doctorate,

17:04.774 --> 17:08.068
practical experience, 15 years.
When's the panel?

17:08.152 --> 17:09.736
- Tuesday. Morning.
- Okay.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.613
How about I give you three things
you can write on your hand?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.823
No, I want to know this.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.658
I think that a lot of what's going on
in the world

17:14.742 --> 17:16.535
- has to do with the economy.
- You may be on to something.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.830
- It's not like I need to know everything.
- You'll be in no danger of that.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.373
- Joke well crafted.
- Thank you.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.541
- Go home.
- Yep.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.067
Welcome back to ACN Morning

17:49.152 --> 17:51.194
where it's 22 minutes past the hour
on this cold New York...

17:51.279 --> 17:54.406
- Very cold.
- Very cold February 11th in New York.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.992
Coming up, we go behind the scenes
of the Jennifer Aniston comedy,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.285
Just Go with It, hitting theaters today.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.746
And later, we'll be live
at the Cineplex just up the street

18:00.830 --> 18:03.165
where moviegoers
are braving freezing temperatures

18:03.249 --> 18:07.377
just to be the very first to watch
Never Say Never.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.545
Do you have Bieber Fever?

18:08.629 --> 18:11.006
I'm not ashamed to say
I do have Bieber Fever.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.176
- But right now, it's time to play a round of...
- "What Caught My Eye."

18:14.260 --> 18:17.429
I'll tell you what caught my eye this morning.
It was an item about our own house.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.099
TMI! Is reporting online
that News Night may be playing favorites

18:21.184 --> 18:25.979
by boosting the profile of the boyfriend
of its executive producer, MacKenzie McHale.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.607
- Did you see that?
- I did, but we don't know the facts about that.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.943
Well, the facts are MacKenzie McHale
is the executive producer of News Night.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.447
Wade Campbell is her boyfriend.
Wade's got political ambitions.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.115
And he's turned up as a guest on the show,

18:37.200 --> 18:40.076
so the piece says,
five times in the last six weeks or so.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.953
What do you think, ethical?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.456
Millie, put me through
to the day side control room.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.875
I'll tell you what makes this
even a little more complicated.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.252
- Tony.
- MacKenzie McHale and Will McAvoy

18:49.337 --> 18:50.796
used to be a couple.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.965
So things have to be a little tense
on the prime time side.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.176
Ask me how I know they were a couple,
'cause this is a wild story.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.511
- I know how you know.
- The email.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.847
MacKenzie McHale sent a mass email
to every employee of AWM

19:00.932 --> 19:03.308
- saying that she had cheated on Will.
- Let's move on.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.143
We've all done that, right?
I don't mean cheated.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.686
I mean we've all hit the wrong key...

19:06.771 --> 19:09.481
This is Charlie Skinner.
Put me right in his fucking ear.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.775
So we've got an anchor
and an executive producer

19:11.859 --> 19:12.901
who used to be involved...

19:12.985 --> 19:17.447
Hi. You've got 10 seconds
to take your show gracefully to commercial,

19:17.949 --> 19:21.993
or, so help me Hannah, you're not going
to be sitting in that chair when we come back.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.995
Well, you get the picture.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.208
We're gonna take a break
and come back after the break.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.085
This is ACN Morning.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.254
Very graceful.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.600
She really wasn't ashamed
to say she had Bieber Fever?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.190
It's all right.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.321
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.031
Oh, wow.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.327
I didn't... I didn't realize
it was Valentine's Day.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.745
And that people in the office gave...

20:05.830 --> 20:09.708
No, Valentine's Day is Monday, not today.
And these aren't for you. They're from you.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.209
I am more confused than I was before.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.129
Don planned a beautiful night for us
on Monday.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.505
- You and me?
- Yes.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.549
Don planned a romantic evening
for you and me.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.551
- Me and him.
- That makes more sense.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.011
And I don't want it to be ruined by Lisa,

20:21.095 --> 20:24.306
who will ruin it if she doesn't have
a romantic Valentine's Day.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.058
Last year, her boyfriend forgot
it was Valentine's Day

20:27.143 --> 20:30.562
and went to a Rangers game with his friends.
She got drunk, made us watch Overboard,

20:30.646 --> 20:34.733
and reviewed every bad Valentine's Day
she's ever had, which was all of them.

20:34.817 --> 20:38.820
Not this year.
You're gonna be like St. Valentine himself.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.864
- St. Valentine actually...
- Focus, nerd.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.742
- Okay.
- Don got us a room at the Four Seasons.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.077
- Me and...
- Nope, still him and me.

20:46.162 --> 20:50.415
The Four Seasons.
The bathtub fills up in less than 60 seconds.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.584
And I don't want Lisa showing up
with a copy of The Notebook

20:52.668 --> 20:53.627
saying, "Where's the minibar?"

20:53.711 --> 20:56.755
Yeah, I can't hang out with Lisa
on Valentine's Day.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.341
That's making a pretty strong statement.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.259
Don't screw with me on this,
James Tiberius Harper.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.719
That's not my middle name.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.013
You're thinking of
Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.473
Do not screw me on this, Jim.

21:06.557 --> 21:09.893
We're not in a relationship.
She calls me at night after work.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.604
We talk for a minute, and then she says,
"Should I come over?"

21:12.688 --> 21:13.939
And what am I supposed to say?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.107
- You say, "Yes."
- I say, "Yes."

21:16.192 --> 21:21.154
If you're dating someone on February 14th,
you take them out on February 14th.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.114
What's February 14th?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.533
- Valentine's Day.
- Yes.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.952
Here's your itinerary.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.496
You made reservations
at her favorite restaurant, Dell'anima.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.248
You got her a horse charm
for her charm bracelet.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.752
This is a bottle of her favorite wine.
And this is some slutty lingerie

21:35.836 --> 21:38.296
for whatever disgusting thing
you guys do later.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.382
And the 60-second bathtub is for hygiene?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.175
You can't have sex in a bathtub.
It doesn't work.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.719
Yes, it does. You just have to slip yourself...

21:44.804 --> 21:46.179
- Thank you.
- I'd like to hear more.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.430
- Shut up!
- Okay.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.725
Here is her card.
And here is what you'll write on it.

21:50.810 --> 21:55.855
"This has been the best month of my life.
You are beautiful, talented, and the most..."

21:55.940 --> 21:57.565
Are you out of your mind?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.567
- We've been on four dates.
- Look at me.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.819
I already am.

22:00.903 --> 22:06.658
Do not screw me on this, Jim.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.702
You pick her up at 9:30.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.120
Let's go.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.000
He's online.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.839
- Amen?
- Yes?

22:21.382 --> 22:23.883
I'm Neal Sampat,
Atlantis Cable News in New York.

22:23.968 --> 22:27.262
- Did we communicate about an hour ago?
- Yes, we did.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.684
What did I say my favorite kind of pizza was?

22:33.227 --> 22:36.438
Plain pizza. Cheese. You're a purist.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.441
It's true.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.529
Amen, we'd like to pay you
to be our reporter on the ground.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.364
You're obviously able to move around
out there.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.033
Your quotes and sources all check out.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.369
You're asking great questions,
and you're posting great film.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.913
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, we have a deal.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.331
Good.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.127
This is our executive producer.
That's the boss.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.880
Her name is MacKenzie McHale.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.758
Amen, thanks so much
for agreeing to help us.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.593
Thank you for broadcasting this.

23:06.677 --> 23:11.389
We go on the air at 3:00 a.m. Your time,
and you'll be part of the top story.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.893
I want you to report
from the middle of Tahrir Square.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.228
But first, we need interviews.

23:17.646 --> 23:21.733
We need you to go to the palace
and find out who's in charge.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.569
- Can you do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.781
We need you to talk
to a member of the military

23:27.865 --> 23:29.949
and see what their marching orders are.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.118
- Can you do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.914
Do you have a BeachTek with an XLR adapter
so you can go wireless?

23:35.998 --> 23:38.833
I have a handheld directional,
but it works pretty well.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.960
Okay, but you have to check your levels.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.213
We'll have a problem
with over-modulated sound.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.006
- Got it.
- We're gonna need any B-roll

23:45.091 --> 23:46.382
you shot last night.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.927
Can you compress it into a YouSendlt file?

23:49.011 --> 23:51.846
It should be downloading on your computer.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.057
It is. Thank you.

23:55.392 --> 23:59.479
- Okay, one last thing.
- Yes?

24:00.064 --> 24:02.232
We need you to take off your bandana.

24:02.316 --> 24:06.027
We have to ID you with your real name,
first and last.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.779
Do you understand?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.364
That's necessary?

24:10.282 --> 24:14.410
The report won't have credibility
coming from an anonymous reporter.

24:20.543 --> 24:24.671
Amen, every news outlet in the world
is gonna be there.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.632
But you'll be the first Egyptian reporter
on an American network

24:27.716 --> 24:31.803
to describe what it's like living through
this Berlin Wall moment for the Middle East.

24:31.887 --> 24:35.223
This is history,
and you'll never forget tonight.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.229
Yes, of course. You're right.

24:47.236 --> 24:51.281
My name is Salim. Kahlid Salim.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.496
Kahlid, let's go through
some technical details.

25:01.083 --> 25:05.086
- First of all, how do you spell Kahlid?
- K-A-H-L...

25:06.547 --> 25:09.841
Are you gonna be nervous about Leona
if I look into the Koch brothers on Wisconsin?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.885
Are you gonna be nervous
about more tabloid stories?

25:11.969 --> 25:13.136
Have I ever been nervous

25:13.220 --> 25:15.013
- about the tabloid stories?
- You?

25:15.097 --> 25:17.348
Would it make life easier for everyone
if I quietly resigned?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.933
- No.
- No, and when was the last time

25:19.018 --> 25:21.060
- you quietly did anything?
- I can be quiet.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.938
For instance, there was the time you sent
an email to 138,000 people.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.940
I sent it to 112 people.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.402
- And then it got sent to...
- Will the two of you shut up?

25:29.486 --> 25:33.114
This is exactly the kind of story
Leona doesn't want us to chase, so...

25:33.199 --> 25:35.825
- Let's chase it as hard as we can?
- Yeah.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.913
Do me a favor and see if there's a connection

25:39.997 --> 25:41.998
between the Koch brothers
and Citizens United.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.292
- I'm way ahead of you.
- How?

25:45.294 --> 25:49.255
Well, no, I'm exactly where you are.
It's just an expression.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.092
Usually it takes decades, even centuries,
for us to see the world change.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.054
But in the Middle East,
the world has changed in seven weeks.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.933
January 25th, protesters converged
on Cairo's Tahrir Square

26:00.017 --> 26:02.685
demanding the resignation
of President Hosni Mubarak,

26:02.770 --> 26:04.896
who'd ruled Egypt for 30 years.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.942
Last night, Mubarak enraged
the Egyptian people by refusing to resign.

26:09.026 --> 26:12.445
But just 24 hours later,
he bowed to the will of the people

26:12.529 --> 26:15.198
and announced the following
through his vice president, Omar Suleiman.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.366
Roll two, take it.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.536
Dear citizens of these difficult times...

26:21.205 --> 26:23.748
You're a handsome young man, Kahlid.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.583
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.585
Here's Tahrir Square
just moments later.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.795
Roll three. Take it.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.636
They're chanting "Egypt is free.
You're an Egyptian. Lift up your head."

26:40.057 --> 26:42.308
For more, we're going live now to Cairo

26:42.393 --> 26:45.645
where our reporter,
Kahlid Salim, is standing by.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.980
Good morning, Kahlid.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.982
It is a good morning.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.191
Thirty seconds back.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.985
- Will.
- Yeah?

26:52.069 --> 26:53.903
I wanted to mention something to you
just for what it's worth.

26:53.988 --> 26:55.822
- What?
- I used to work at TMI!

26:55.906 --> 26:57.615
There was a rumor,
it was a little more than rumor,

26:57.700 --> 26:59.867
that some of the guys at TMI!
Would take protection money.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.035
What are you talking about?

27:01.870 --> 27:03.454
You give them money,
and your name stays out.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.623
You just get in touch with Nina Howard,
pay her what she wants...

27:05.708 --> 27:07.166
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just mentioning it.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.876
They took protection money at TMI!?

27:09.253 --> 27:10.920
In three, two...

27:12.089 --> 27:14.757
Welcome back.
We go from Cairo to Madison, Wisconsin,

27:14.842 --> 27:17.135
where thousands of people
are converging on the statehouse

27:17.219 --> 27:20.054
to protest Governor Scott Walker's
proposed budget bill.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.058
There it is. Can you see us?

27:25.060 --> 27:27.103
- Yes.
- That was real good work.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.606
Thank you. I've got some excellent footage
of the disinfectant brigades.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.483
What are the disinfectant brigades?

27:32.568 --> 27:35.486
Most of Tahrir
is old ladies sweeping up right now.

27:35.571 --> 27:36.779
The kids changed the country,

27:36.864 --> 27:38.948
then they brought in the moms
to clean up after.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.200
The whole place smells like Lysol.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.453
And they call it a nonviolent revolution.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.455
I wouldn't say it was a revolution.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.707
- Why's that?
- The army's still in charge.

27:47.791 --> 27:52.503
So I suppose I'd call it a military coup.
But we'll get there.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.089
For the moment,
we traded an 82-year-old dictator

27:55.174 --> 27:58.343
for a 79-year-old field marshal
who's been called Mubarak's poodle.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.511
Who called him Mubarak's poodle?

28:00.596 --> 28:04.682
Your State Department
in emails released by WikiLeaks.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.893
- WikiLeaks.
- The army's not the good guys?

28:06.977 --> 28:10.646
I think that's where to go with the story.
Will there be free and fair elections?

28:10.731 --> 28:12.523
Will the army protect pro-Mubarak thugs

28:12.608 --> 28:15.109
who killed hundreds
in the last two and a half weeks?

28:15.194 --> 28:20.365
I was in Tahrir the night they killed 91.
Old men and children beaten and shot.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.367
Okay, brother, where do you want to go next?

28:22.451 --> 28:24.202
The Ministry of the Interior.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.497
If Mubarak wanted to throw you in a hole,
that was it.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.082
The army's got it cordoned off,

28:29.166 --> 28:31.084
and they're burning documents
in the courtyard.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.378
- That's a government building.
- He's all right.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.463
Kahlid, you get us film
of the army burning evidence,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.758
and I'll personally come down there
with a truckload of Lemon Pledge.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.968
I won't let you down with this.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.888
You understand the difference between
a commercial bank and an investment bank?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.348
- Of course.
- Kenzie?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.433
- No.
- Investment banks are gamblers.

28:47.518 --> 28:50.895
Commercial banks are where you have
a savings account and a checking account.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.897
- Can you balance your checkbook?
- Yes.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.148
- Kenzie?
- No.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.944
All right, so after the Great Depression,
Congress wanted to put a firewall

28:58.028 --> 29:00.363
between the investment banks
and the commercial banks.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.199
They wanted to make sure
that Wall Street could melt to the ground,

29:03.283 --> 29:05.243
and the commercial banks
wouldn't be touched.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.703
They passed a law, the Glass-Steagall Act.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.665
Now you could be Gordon Gekko
or George Bailey,

29:10.749 --> 29:13.167
but you couldn't be both.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.129
You with me?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.090
I can't seem to stop hurting Will.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.510
This morning was just fucked up.

29:22.594 --> 29:26.180
Day side at this place just resents prime time,
and that's all that was.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.974
- Is Will mad at you?
- No.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.643
That probably makes you feel worse.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.104
And my saying that
just then probably makes you feel

29:33.188 --> 29:34.772
a lot worse than you did
a couple seconds ago.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.566
Do you have any human knowledge?

29:36.650 --> 29:37.900
I have been told I do not.

29:40.904 --> 29:41.988
Let's keep going.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.115
I can't help but think
this is all partially my fault.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.118
I'm the one who didn't believe you when
you told me that Will didn't cheat on you,

29:47.202 --> 29:48.703
- and that's why you...
- I had to send the email, right.

29:48.787 --> 29:53.958
Don't be ridiculous. It's completely your fault.
It's so unbelievably your... No.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.586
I am the closest thing to a female friend
that you have, right?

29:56.670 --> 29:58.671
Wait, are you saying
that I don't have female friends,

29:58.755 --> 30:00.131
or that you're not entirely female?

30:00.215 --> 30:01.591
- Which do you think?
- The first.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.427
Yes. So what happened,
and why can't it be fixed?

30:06.722 --> 30:10.766
What happened was
I was with a guy for a long time

30:10.851 --> 30:13.978
who wasn't half the man that Will is,
and he dumped me.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.522
- Later I started seeing Will.
- I can fill in the rest of the story.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.816
- Why can't it be fixed?
- Listen, do you mind if we just talk...

30:18.901 --> 30:21.652
- Yeah, Glass-Steagall.
- The firewall, it worked?

30:21.737 --> 30:25.406
It helped lead to the largest sustained period
of economic growth in US history,

30:25.491 --> 30:28.910
a 60-year expansion of the middle class,
the largest increase in productivity,

30:28.994 --> 30:31.370
and the largest increase in median income.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.831
We also won World War II,
put a man on the moon

30:33.916 --> 30:36.125
and a computer in everyone's lap.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.502
And you know what happened next?

30:37.586 --> 30:40.379
We cheated on the perfect guy
with a guy who dumped us?

30:41.423 --> 30:44.217
Yes. We repealed Glass-Steagall.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.598
Why can't it be fixed?

30:55.771 --> 30:58.356
Hey, I've got to write something
on a Valentine's card.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.025
You're used to deceiving women.
What would you write...

31:01.109 --> 31:02.860
- I can't find Kahlid.
- What do you mean?

31:02.945 --> 31:04.946
I haven't heard from him
since Saturday night his time,

31:05.030 --> 31:07.198
and he hasn't updated his Twitter
or Facebook.

31:07.282 --> 31:10.034
- Have you tried contacting...
- All his contacts, Facebook, YouTube.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.160
No one's heard from him.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.120
Guys, Elliot Hirsch.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.378
Thank you.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.964
I'm fine, really.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.842
And thanks, everyone,
for the calls, and the emails, and the flowers.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.471
And the stripper
dressed as a pro-Mubarak security officer.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.391
You wouldn't think
they'd have that outfit in storage.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.185
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.937
- Charlie.
- Hang on.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.940
Welcome back, Elliot.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.733
- Everyone's really happy you're all right.
- Thanks, man.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.528
The coverage from the stringer,
it was great Friday night.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.572
- They told me that was you.
- Yeah.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.700
But I can't find him. It's been about 36 hours.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.245
- Did you try...
- I've tried everything.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.373
All right, he's got our satellite phone.
The one the two of us were using.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.042
You can get the provider to run a GPS trace
to tell you where the phone is.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.836
Good. Thank you.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.506
Did someone here order a fascist thug?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.800
No, we did this already.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.886
- He's home.
- Thank you, God.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.974
- I can't hug you, right?
- No, my ribs.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.684
All right.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.188
- Elliot.
- Yes, sir?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.691
- Don't ever fucking do that again.
- Yes, sir.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.484
Will filled in Friday night.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.612
I'll have Becky fill in tonight
and until you're ready to...

32:27.696 --> 32:29.697
No, that's why we're here.
I want him on the air tonight.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.408
- And shoot him from the neck down?
- No, we show what's going on.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.368
- Journalists are getting beaten up.
- I know, but...

32:34.453 --> 32:37.413
He took the lead for ACN
on the biggest international story in a decade.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.332
- You can't take him off.
- It'll just be for a week or so.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.833
- Just till my face heals...
- You don't want to go on?

32:40.917 --> 32:44.462
- Of course I want to go on, but...
- Then that's it.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.297
This is a great reporter
who brought us a great story.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.549
I didn't bring any story.
I got beaten up before I had a chance...

32:48.634 --> 32:49.759
That's the story.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.763
No, I didn't mean that that's the story.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.765
I meant that
yes, I know that we're not the story.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.476
But Jesus, God damn it,
nobody's ever gonna know that he...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.227
- We know.
- That's not good enough.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.896
Yes, it is.

33:04.524 --> 33:08.736
Fine. And the media,
we're all effete, elitist assholes.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.782
We're blow-dried clowns
sitting in an ivory tower. Just look.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.950
You're benched.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.957
- Will.
- Yeah?

33:22.042 --> 33:23.501
I need to talk to you.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.673
First, Maria Guerrero wanted me
to relay a message that she feels terrible.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.174
Why isn't she saying that herself?

33:30.258 --> 33:33.219
- She's terrified of you.
- That's fair.

33:33.303 --> 33:35.721
Look, Tony thinks prime time looks down
their nose at day side.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.349
- That's all that was about.
- Well, he really turned me around.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.352
Tell Maria I saw her try to stop it,
and I appreciate it.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.853
I will, but I came here to tell you

33:42.938 --> 33:44.689
that Nina Howard is getting ready
to run another piece.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.608
I don't care.
Nina can write whatever she wants about me.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.777
It's about Mac.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.115
What is she writing?

33:54.199 --> 33:57.952
Did she almost get her crew killed
during an incident in Pakistan?

33:59.246 --> 34:00.955
You've got her number?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.417
This really works?

34:04.501 --> 34:06.627
If it were me, I'd try it.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.547
We're in the conference room.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.966
Gary, why don't you tell your friends
on day side

34:12.050 --> 34:14.260
that if they've got any questions
about MacKenzie's ethics,

34:14.344 --> 34:16.429
- they can come see me?
- Yeah.

34:19.307 --> 34:22.935
- Get your head looked at?
- Just needed a couple stitches.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.366
The answer is yes, the Koch brothers
had money in Citizens United.

34:37.451 --> 34:40.828
A number of Koch-funded groups
submitted amicus briefs to the court,

34:40.912 --> 34:43.122
including the Cato Institute,
which the Kochs funded.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.375
They submitted a brief calling
for unfettered corporate speech.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.837
So did the Institute for Justice,
also funded by the Kochs.

34:50.297 --> 34:55.259
Their brief said that finance laws prohibiting
unlimited corporate contributions

34:55.343 --> 34:58.971
trumped the First Amendment.
And after the court ruled in their favor,

34:59.055 --> 35:02.683
these groups spent a lot of money
to oppose efforts to provide transparency.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.478
Here's an interview
with David Koch and his lawyer.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.438
Koch's asked about Citizens United,

35:07.522 --> 35:09.273
and he seems to pretend
he's never heard of it.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.193
Koch is in the foreground
in the gray herringbone coat.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.153
What do you think
of Citizens United?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.780
Has it helped your influence?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.323
Citizens United?

35:20.368 --> 35:21.660
What do you think
of Citizens United?

35:21.745 --> 35:23.078
Has it helped your influence?

35:23.163 --> 35:24.538
Citizens United?

35:25.499 --> 35:26.707
One more time.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.461
What do you think of Citizens United?
Has it helped your influence?

35:30.545 --> 35:32.463
Citizens United?

35:34.883 --> 35:38.677
Justices Thomas and Scalia
have both been frequent guests of the Kochs.

35:38.762 --> 35:44.558
And between 2003 and 2007,
Virginia Thomas, wife of Justice Thomas,

35:44.643 --> 35:49.980
was paid $686,589
by the Heritage Foundation,

35:50.065 --> 35:52.274
which was funded by David and Charles Koch.

35:52.359 --> 35:56.695
For whatever reason,
Justice Thomas didn't disclose the $686,000

35:56.780 --> 35:59.365
on his Supreme Court
financial disclosure form.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.993
Is it very unusual that Scalia and Thomas
didn't recuse themselves from the case?

36:03.078 --> 36:06.372
If they had,
Citizens United would have lost 4-3.

36:06.456 --> 36:09.875
All right, the Citizens United decision
allowed corporations

36:09.960 --> 36:13.003
to donate unlimited amounts of money
to any political candidate

36:13.088 --> 36:14.839
without anyone knowing
where the money was coming from.

36:14.923 --> 36:19.176
But it also did the same thing for the unions,
and they knew that.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.929
So wouldn't the next step be
to get rid of the unions?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.472
If you're rigging the game, yes.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.016
Excuse me. Kahlid's gone.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.185
The satellite service says
his phone isn't giving a signal,

36:28.270 --> 36:31.522
which means it's either destroyed
or very deep underground.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.525
We sent him to get evidence of the army
burning documents. He's been taken.

36:34.609 --> 36:37.695
We have a local security contractor in Cairo.
I'll start with them.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.406
Will, you call your highest contact
at the State Department.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.866
And then call her husband if you have to.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.701
Don, you've got contacts
at the Egyptian embassy.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.077
- I used to.
- What do you mean?

36:45.161 --> 36:46.537
Their government was just dissolved.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.123
Come on. We put the guy in that place.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.543
- Neal, we're not losing him.
- Jesus.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.587
- Do you have contacts in the Egyptian army?
- I do.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.964
So do I. We can retrace his steps.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.508
Snerdley, have you
heard this?

36:59.593 --> 37:02.720
The Egyptian army
is rounding up foreign journalists.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.848
I mean, even two New York Times reporters
were detained.

37:05.932 --> 37:09.560
Now this is supposed
to make us feel what exactly?

37:09.644 --> 37:11.312
- How are we supposed to feel?
- Neal.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.898
Are we supposed to feel outrage over it?
I don't feel any outrage over it.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.525
Are we supposed to feel anger?

37:16.610 --> 37:18.903
I don't feel any anger over this.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.031
Do we feel happy?

37:22.115 --> 37:26.327
Well, do we feel...

37:26.411 --> 37:28.662
Kind of going like "Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah"?

37:31.124 --> 37:33.083
Do we feel happy?

37:34.836 --> 37:38.255
Well, do we feel...

37:38.924 --> 37:41.508
Kind of going like "Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah"?

37:41.593 --> 37:42.593
Oh!

37:42.677 --> 37:44.762
- Neal!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

37:44.846 --> 37:47.681
Give me your hand.
Come on, give me your hand.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.185
You broke a couple fingers.
Come on. Come on.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.396
I'm sorry.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.899
Let's go.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.155
Corporate legal won't let us work
with security in Cairo.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.282
- Why the hell not?
- They don't want to assume liability

38:05.367 --> 38:07.618
for a freelancer.
They say he can turn around and sue us.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.787
Sue us? He's either a prisoner or dead.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.205
Let's talk to Reese.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.581
I'm the one of us
who's pissed him off the least.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.291
Let me do the talking.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.005
- He's not in, Don.
- I think he is, Roberta.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.800
- Don.
- Reese, get the fuck out here.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.218
Don, he's not in.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.221
Oh, God! Fuck!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.014
It's a strong door.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.645
So, do you know where he can be reached?

38:38.483 --> 38:42.111
Ladies and gentlemen, 30 minutes
to air. We are live in 30 minutes.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.454
I'm gonna put someone's head
through a fucking pyramid.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.708
Now get me somebody on the phone who...
Thank you.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.217
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's sprained.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.262
- The shoulder?
- Yeah.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.140
- Donnie...
- I sent him down there.

39:11.599 --> 39:16.228
I bullied him into going out on the street,
and they beat him up with a rock.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.939
He went out there because I told him to.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.401
I know. Everybody knows.

39:22.485 --> 39:26.447
We're all jealous. We wish it was us
with the bruises on our face.

39:28.074 --> 39:31.076
You didn't give him an order.
You gave him permission.

39:31.161 --> 39:32.786
I got him!

39:36.332 --> 39:38.375
The army's got him.
They denied it until they realized

39:38.460 --> 39:40.669
somebody with money was looking for him.
They say that...

39:40.754 --> 39:42.880
- A fringe group has him.
- Yeah, but it's them.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.133
- What does the fringe group want?
- A quarter of a million dollars, US.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.386
I'm gonna quietly run this
by some people in private security

39:49.471 --> 39:51.346
just to make sure it checks out,

39:51.431 --> 39:55.684
but, Will, you're the only one who can get
Corporate to make this wire transfer.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.061
You got the information on the transfer?

39:57.145 --> 39:59.730
Nobody has to leave a bag of cash
on top of a mailbox?

39:59.814 --> 40:02.149
No, they want you to wire the money

40:02.233 --> 40:06.361
to a charity
called Intisar Charity Benevolence Fund.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.155
They're practically letting us use PayPal.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.490
A charity in Cairo?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.283
No, a commodities trading fund in Dubai.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.578
Talk to your people,
and I'll deal with Corporate.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.664
- How you feeling?
- I feel great.

40:17.749 --> 40:18.999
I'm sorry.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.670
I'm tough on you, and I'm...

40:24.631 --> 40:25.964
I'm so sorry.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.551
You couldn't have stopped me.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.352
Thursday night,
it was 75 teachers in Appleton.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.439
Tonight, the number of protesters in Madison
is estimated at 30,000.

40:42.524 --> 40:46.110
Governor Walker's office is feeding
inside information about their intentions

40:46.194 --> 40:48.821
to friendly groups who in turn are paying

40:48.905 --> 40:52.825
to fill hearing rooms
with supporters of Walker's plan.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.368
Wade's here.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.662
He says you haven't returned his calls
or texts,

40:56.746 --> 40:59.456
and he's not leaving until you speak to him.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.792
Have him wait on the terrace.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.170
It's about 10 degrees outside.

41:05.255 --> 41:08.799
The reelected governor
gave $140 million in tax breaks,

41:08.883 --> 41:11.969
is being balanced on the backs
of public sector workers

41:12.053 --> 41:16.306
who organizations like Americans
for Prosperity believe are overpaid.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.308
You deserved a lot better.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.394
We'll let you decide if they're overpaid.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.520
I deserved what I got.

41:21.604 --> 41:26.650
The low income threshold in the US
is $45,000 a year for a family of four.

41:26.734 --> 41:31.488
Average salary for an employee
of the Health Services Department, $45,805.

41:31.656 --> 41:36.201
Children and Families Agency, $47,810.

41:36.286 --> 41:40.664
Workforce Development Agency, $46,074.

41:40.748 --> 41:44.960
And the average salary
for a public school teacher in Wisconsin,

41:45.044 --> 41:49.089
$46,390.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.850
Finally. Why'd I have to wait out here?

41:59.934 --> 42:01.810
Because I wanted you to.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.022
I've been calling you all day.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.275
Yeah, when was your first meeting
with the DCCC?

42:09.944 --> 42:14.573
- Look, we have to work together on this.
- No, we can't work together.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.950
And because you're not a moron,
you already know that.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.203
Hey, High Road,

42:19.287 --> 42:22.331
were you ever gonna tell me
that you and Will were together?

42:22.415 --> 42:24.541
This was never gonna work, you and me.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.754
You wasted my time,
so I got something out of it.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.381
In this order, leave,

42:31.466 --> 42:34.301
lose the election,

42:34.385 --> 42:36.053
go to hell.

42:45.605 --> 42:46.813
She's in the back.

42:46.898 --> 42:50.609
Anyone comes in I don't want to see,
just buzz my BlackBerry.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.417
I want this to stop.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.754
I was rude to you at a party, and I apologize.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.090
Be a bigger narcissist.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.258
You think this is happening

43:14.342 --> 43:16.927
'cause you didn't take me home
on New Year's Eve?

43:17.011 --> 43:19.304
Your ex booked her boyfriend five times...

43:19.389 --> 43:22.099
If you called for a comment,
I could have told you that I was the one...

43:22.183 --> 43:24.726
Bullshit you want your ex
dating a congressman.

43:24.811 --> 43:27.896
- She didn't know the DCCC was...
- Says you.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.314
- Says her.
- Yeah.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.900
All right, the ethics of Wade
coming on the show,

43:31.985 --> 43:33.819
that was fair. You had every right to run that.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.946
But to say that
she almost got someone killed...

43:36.030 --> 43:39.616
I'm running a piece
saying you hired an incompetent EP

43:39.701 --> 43:41.368
because she was your girlfriend,
and she dumped you.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.662
I hired the best EP in broadcasting

43:43.746 --> 43:45.831
in spite of her being my ex-girlfriend
who dumped me.

43:45.915 --> 43:48.792
You know,
you guys up there are millionaires...

43:48.876 --> 43:51.753
- I'm the only millionaire up there.
...and celebrities.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.089
- I'm the only celebrity up there.
- Not anymore.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.882
How does this work?

43:56.843 --> 44:00.721
I'm thinking about investing in a restaurant,

44:02.098 --> 44:05.809
and I'm looking for silent partners.
$50,000 a share.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.729
- $50,000, and I'm a silent partner?
- Yes.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.064
- And you're a silent partner?
- Quiet as a mouse.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.233
- For good?
- You'll have your own table

44:13.318 --> 44:15.277
at the restaurant for life.

44:23.536 --> 44:24.911
Hey, Will,

44:26.748 --> 44:28.332
we're journalists.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.838
- I wish you hadn't said that.
- What?

44:34.922 --> 44:37.841
Everything would have been cool if you
hadn't said that. You just talk too much.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.802
You have a problem
with me calling myself a journalist?

44:40.887 --> 44:45.640
Only the elite few who cover stories
nobody cares about get to call themselves...

44:45.725 --> 44:49.227
I've got a guy on my staff got hit
in the head with a glass door Thursday.

44:49.312 --> 44:52.022
His forehead wouldn't stop bleeding,
but he wouldn't go to a doctor,

44:52.106 --> 44:54.399
'cause I got another guy
who got beat up covering Cairo.

44:54.484 --> 44:57.986
And the first guy wouldn't see a doctor
until the second guy saw a doctor.

44:58.071 --> 45:02.032
I've got a producer who ran into a locked door
'cause he felt responsible for the second guy.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.702
I've got an 18-year-old kid risking his life
halfway around the world,

45:05.787 --> 45:08.830
and the AP who sent him there
hasn't slept in three days.

45:08.915 --> 45:12.459
I've got 20-somethings
who care about teachers in Wisconsin.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.295
I've got a grown woman
who has to subtract with her fingers

45:15.380 --> 45:17.714
staying up all night trying to learn economics

45:17.799 --> 45:21.760
from a PhD who could be making
20 times the money three miles downtown.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.053
They're journalists.

45:24.639 --> 45:28.058
Come after me all you want, Nina.
Come after me every day.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.226
Look through my garbage.

45:29.310 --> 45:32.396
Invent things out of thin air.
That's what you're paid for.

45:32.480 --> 45:36.566
But you touch my staff,
and you are walking into a world of hurt.

45:36.651 --> 45:42.114
I have an hour of prime time every night,
and I will rededicate my life to ruining yours.

45:43.658 --> 45:46.201
I also want you to send a message
up the chain

45:46.285 --> 45:48.912
of whatever backroom machinery
is driving this

45:48.996 --> 45:53.250
that if I so much as smell Leona Lansing's
perfume on any of this,

45:53.334 --> 45:57.838
I'm going to make a meal out of both of you,
and I won't stop until I'm done.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.006
Look at me.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.927
And see that I'm dead serious.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.104
Restaurants are bad investments.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.315
Wait 20 minutes before you leave here.

46:19.110 --> 46:21.027
Tough-ass speech.

46:23.406 --> 46:25.157
- But you're not gonna win.
- I don't care.

46:25.241 --> 46:28.410
I'm just a middle-aged man
who never lived up to his potential.

46:28.494 --> 46:31.705
You don't want to be on the wrong end of me
if I ever do.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.039
I got the drinks.

46:35.376 --> 46:39.963
1980, Ronald Reagan is elected president,
and the culture of deregulation begins.

46:40.047 --> 46:43.008
What happened to Will?
I haven't seen him around.

46:43.092 --> 46:46.386
- He changed and ran out right after the show.
- Where?

46:47.054 --> 46:50.015
The culture of deregulation culminates
in 1999.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.934
- Glass-Steagall gets repealed.
- And immediately banks start merging.

46:53.019 --> 46:56.855
Now, Gordon Gekko can use
George Bailey's bank balance to make bets.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.356
Where's James Harper?

46:58.774 --> 47:00.567
That's Lisa.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.236
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

47:04.614 --> 47:06.490
It's Valentine's Day. I forgot to meet her.

47:06.574 --> 47:08.992
James Harper? Nobody?

47:09.076 --> 47:11.620
If he is not here, I will stand here...

47:11.704 --> 47:12.913
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.165
- Does this seem like a good plan to you?
- No.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.458
- Get up.
- Please don't make me.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.667
Get up!

47:19.253 --> 47:22.797
But I'm looking for Jim
because he did not come.

47:22.882 --> 47:24.883
- Anyone? James?
- Lisa.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.010
I am so sorry. It's been a very chaotic day.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.803
Where the fuck have you been?

47:31.140 --> 47:33.016
- Like I said, it's been...
- You don't know how to use a phone?

47:33.100 --> 47:36.770
I might have a concussion, but still I'm sorry.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.648
You're sorry?
All right, in that case, I totally forgive you

47:39.732 --> 47:41.983
for making me wait alone
in a restaurant for an hour.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.610
I appreciate that.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.070
- Unless you're being sarcastic.
- She was.

47:45.154 --> 47:46.404
I thought there was an outside chance...

47:46.489 --> 47:47.781
- Did you get any of my messages?
- No.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.241
- Wait, are you Lisa?
- Yes.

47:49.325 --> 47:50.784
- I got your messages.
- What?

47:50.868 --> 47:52.452
We accidentally switched phones again.

47:52.537 --> 47:53.954
What happened to marking them
with nail polish?

47:54.038 --> 47:55.247
We both did that.

47:55.331 --> 47:57.415
You stood me up on Valentine's Day,

47:57.500 --> 47:59.626
which is 1,000 times worse
than a regular stand up.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.378
- I didn't stand you up.
- Yes, you did.

48:01.462 --> 48:04.714
Yes, I did, but I have presents,

48:05.424 --> 48:07.842
and I wrote you a card.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.097
"From the desk of James Harper."

48:12.181 --> 48:13.723
- Are you kidding?
- I lost the card.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.308
- You're a jerk.
- No, he's not.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.560
- Maggie.
- Lisa, stop.

48:16.644 --> 48:18.144
- You know what?
- Stop!

48:18.646 --> 48:20.313
Jim did everything right here.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.148
Well, he left me alone in a restaurant
for an hour.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.358
- Except that.
- And didn't call.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.485
- And that.
- It would be hard for a casual observer

48:25.570 --> 48:27.070
- to tell which side...
- Shut up.

48:27.154 --> 48:29.656
Lisa, he's a very decent guy.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.409
- This isn't anyone's fault.
- It's his.

48:32.493 --> 48:36.538
It's a little bit his,
but mostly it's just a very bad day.

48:36.622 --> 48:39.958
It's Valentine's Day. It's my favorite day.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.876
Then pick another day!

48:42.336 --> 48:44.087
Because it's every guy's least favorite day.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.922
Everyone's always disappointed.

48:46.007 --> 48:48.925
Valentine's Day is the bully of holidays.

48:49.385 --> 48:51.261
It forces love on people who aren't in love.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.596
- Cupid's freakish.
- All right.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.765
No, I'm boycotting Valentine's Day
from now on.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.350
Who's with me?

49:00.688 --> 49:02.856
I love you every day.

49:02.940 --> 49:06.401
Today's just an excuse
to spend the night in a hotel room.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.488
I'm sorry. I was faking it just then.

49:10.740 --> 49:12.824
I think she can still hear you.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.287
I'm sorry.

49:18.581 --> 49:20.707
I'm really sorry.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.129
I'm still wearing edible underwear.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.297
Well, if I'd known that...

49:27.381 --> 49:28.923
Shut up!

49:31.052 --> 49:34.179
It's one big Jenga tower.
You pull a piece out, put it on top,

49:34.263 --> 49:37.557
and the tower definitely gets higher,
but also gets less stable.

49:38.434 --> 49:39.809
Will's back.

49:42.897 --> 49:44.189
Let's do this.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.193
Oi.

49:55.785 --> 49:57.911
- Where have you been?
- I had to run an errand.

49:57.995 --> 50:00.497
- What kind of errand?
- I wanted some gum. Got it.

50:01.248 --> 50:02.374
Let me tell you something, Billy.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.542
I ever find out you paid
a gossip columnist money

50:04.627 --> 50:08.505
to protect me, I will beat you senseless.
And you know I can do it, because I'm crafty.

50:08.589 --> 50:09.589
I know.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.257
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.220
I hear Corporate wired the money.

50:15.304 --> 50:17.305
- Kahlid's home.
- Yeah.

50:17.390 --> 50:21.017
Funny, because legal wouldn't even let us talk
to our own security about Kahlid

50:21.102 --> 50:23.186
- because of the exposure.
- They changed their mind.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.270
Hmm.

50:25.815 --> 50:29.859
Did you know that it was Bill Clinton
who signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall?

50:29.944 --> 50:31.486
Yeah, everybody knows that.

50:31.570 --> 50:34.447
Well, now everybody knows it.

50:35.991 --> 50:37.033
How are the lessons going?

50:37.118 --> 50:39.786
Corporate didn't wire anything. You did.

50:43.124 --> 50:45.125
He's one of our guys.

50:47.294 --> 50:48.294
Yeah.

50:51.465 --> 50:53.299
Speaking of which...

51:01.142 --> 51:03.309
It's not much, but I'd like to help with this.

51:03.394 --> 51:06.646
- Neal, you can't afford it.
- Please.

51:08.441 --> 51:09.899
Sure. Thank you.

51:14.029 --> 51:17.365
All right, so I...

51:20.161 --> 51:21.995
- It's not much.
- Maggie.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.329
Please.

51:24.749 --> 51:26.040
What's this in the memo line?

51:26.125 --> 51:27.584
Read it.

51:28.419 --> 51:29.794
"Coach."

52:22.556 --> 52:24.390
We want Rudy to dress for the game, Coach.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.392
You guys are missing your fife and drum.

52:40.741 --> 52:42.367
You did this?

52:43.077 --> 52:45.036
Happy Valentine's Day.
