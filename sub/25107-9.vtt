00:10.969 --> 00:14.305
<i>While waiting for Michael</i>
<i>to return from prison with Buster,</i>

00:14.681 --> 00:18.018
<i>the Bluth family was recycling
a welcome home party.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:20.770
Why do we have to have
a partyevery time someone in this family

00:20.854 --> 00:23.565
- is released from prison?
- Tradition.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.066
Some traditions get old.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.277
Like that god-awful thing
you used to make me do

00:27.360 --> 00:28.486
on your birthday.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.155
Cook?

00:30.697 --> 00:33.616
Plus, we have some business problems
to deal with.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.952
Sally Sitwell
won the election and now,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.788
for whatever reason,
supports building the wall.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.207
We need to come up
with two million dollars

00:41.332 --> 00:43.543
- or we're gonna make powerful enemies.
- Okay.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.128
Right, shush.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.755
Not in front of the grandkids.
I don't want them to know

00:46.838 --> 00:48.089
about the shady business scams

00:48.173 --> 00:50.508
- that go on in this family.
- We lied to investors,

00:50.592 --> 00:53.303
so we have no product
and we're two million dollars in debt.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.180
The next welcome home party's
gonna be for us.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.766
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
My name isn't on anything.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.602
Why are you so riled up all of a sudden?

01:00.685 --> 01:03.021
<i>He was nervous</i>
<i>because after his girlfriend invested</i>

01:03.104 --> 01:04.605
<i>in his non-existent business,</i>

01:04.688 --> 01:05.857
...everybody needs a bail-out...

01:05.940 --> 01:08.234
<i>The pressures of his lie only grew worse.</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.070
- ...a date with a sexy man.
- What? I thought

01:10.153 --> 01:12.697
- I was taking you out tonight.
- Oh, relax, you're fine.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.200
Know what? I've never been attracted
to handsome men.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.117
Ah.

01:16.201 --> 01:20.038
Fakeblock is gonna change the world.
Which reminds me, I'm dying to see it.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.834
No, I know, it's... We've just been busy
with all our coding and all the goddamn...

01:24.918 --> 01:28.254
...coding and, um...

01:28.338 --> 01:29.714
also programming, so it's ju...

01:29.798 --> 01:32.675
But as soon as it's up and running,
we'll... we'll get you over there and...

01:32.759 --> 01:36.971
No. As a part-owner, I want to see it
while all the work is happening,

01:37.055 --> 01:39.265
- and I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
- Well, but,

01:39.349 --> 01:40.767
- the coding, and...
<i>- Well, problem solved.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:42.185
Stick her with all of it.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.895
Let her buy it.
She'll get all our liabilities,

01:43.978 --> 01:45.772
and then anything
over two million, we get to keep.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.191
I can't do that
to someone that I have feelings for.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.068
So stop having feelings for her.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.195
What?
Is that something you can do with people?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.447
Yeah, once I learned
how to do it with my parents,

01:54.531 --> 01:57.617
it was easy with everyone else.
It's like a heart switch, you know?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.745
Click. I love you. Click. I love you not.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.623
Click. I love you. Click. I love you not.

02:03.998 --> 02:04.916
Can't you do that?

02:05.708 --> 02:08.086
No, but in my defense,
I'm not a sociopath.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.508
Click.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.344
<i>On the other side</i>
<i>of the room, however,</i>

02:16.427 --> 02:18.888
<i>Gob still had a very uncomfortable</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:21.182
<i>"heart on" for his friend Tony.</i>

02:21.516 --> 02:25.186
<i>- Who had recently disappeared.</i>
- He's alive. He got out.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.188
<i>It seems the Christian-y fellow...</i>

02:27.272 --> 02:28.481
Definitely got out, right?

02:28.565 --> 02:31.025
<i>...is now a gay man and,
by the looks of things,</i>

02:31.109 --> 02:34.154
<i>- he'll be staying that way.</i>
- Why wouldn't he come out?

02:34.445 --> 02:38.074
Oh, who knows what makes a guy
think he can pass for straight?

02:38.449 --> 02:40.702
I mean, if he really is gay,
he can try to hide it,

02:40.785 --> 02:42.954
but trust me, it will come out

02:43.037 --> 02:44.831
in the most unexpected balls.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.916
Yeah, but the problem is
that now the world thinks

02:47.000 --> 02:48.585
that I'm gay, and if I say it was a trick,

02:48.668 --> 02:51.045
well, then the alliance
will have <i>me </i> by the balls.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.840
Uh...

02:54.215 --> 02:55.967
Excuse me, "balls"?

02:56.467 --> 02:59.053
You realize you just said "balls"?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.014
- But you said balls.
- Oh, well that's

03:01.097 --> 03:02.807
three times I'm hearing balls now.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.602
I put... You said balls, so...
Then I said balls...

03:05.685 --> 03:08.146
Why don't you tell Rebel
she can't see the company?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.398
Then she's gonna know
I'm not a tech entrepreneur

03:10.481 --> 03:11.482
named George Maharis.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.152
- And I'm the sociopath.
- Both of our hands

03:14.235 --> 03:15.737
- were all over...
- What if I take her there,

03:15.820 --> 03:18.072
but it's locked, and I can't wait
to eat this snow cone.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.949
- Lovely party.
- Yeah, it is a great party.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.911
What if I take her there,
but it's locked and we can't get in?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.955
That's the sign of a healthy business.
It's closed in the middle of a Tuesday,

03:26.039 --> 03:27.749
- and the owner's locked out.
<i>- Of course,</i>

03:27.832 --> 03:30.043
<i>these are paid protestors
that the magicians hired.</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:33.504
<i>Not real protestors, but that's
kind of the norm now, isn't it?</i>

03:33.588 --> 03:35.131
What if she's afraid to go in?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.592
'Cause there's angry protesters out front?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.221
- Who would protest a tech company?
- Anonymous.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.473
- What's that?
- You don't know Anonymous?

03:43.640 --> 03:46.142
They're those hacker guys that
wear those Guy Fawkes masks?

03:47.018 --> 03:49.437
Oh, shit.
That's who the note was from.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.107
<i>George Michael had</i>
<i>first seen the name Anonymous</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:54.651
<i>when debuting his software...</i>

03:54.734 --> 03:56.819
Uh, I'd like to thank...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.571
<i>...which he thought was code</i>

03:58.655 --> 04:00.281
<i>- from Rebel.</i>
- Let's put up this wall.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.574
- Have a good night.
<i>- Having paid little attention</i>

04:01.658 --> 04:03.868
<i>to the men in the Guy Fawkes masks.</i>

04:04.244 --> 04:06.746
<i>- Men who continued to harass him.</i>
- Okay, so,

04:06.829 --> 04:08.331
for scenario number two. You found out...

04:08.414 --> 04:10.875
<i>We'll find you</i>
<i>and destroy Fakeblock.</i>

04:10.959 --> 04:13.586
<i>You can hide
behind your mask like a coward,</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:16.589
<i>but I will... Oh, well, that's
a bad example, obviously...</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:19.091
<i>David,</i>
<i>you want Pop-Tarts for dinner?</i>

04:19.175 --> 04:20.677
<i>Mom, don't say my name!</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:23.263
<i>But Anonymous failed</i>
<i>to be specific enough</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:25.139
<i>- to make an impression.</i>
<i>- I understand</i>

04:25.223 --> 04:26.641
<i>you've ignored my cousin Kevin's...</i>

04:26.724 --> 04:29.310
<i>- I mean, Anonymous' other warning...</i>
- Hello.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.770
They've been threatening me
for months.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.815
Hey, that's perfect.
Those guys will ruin your life.

04:34.732 --> 04:38.903
- Hey, where did you find those guys?
- They're paid protestors, boy!

04:38.987 --> 04:41.072
Gay Gob's funny.

04:41.155 --> 04:44.075
Uh, do you think they could be Anonymous?
Like Guy Fawkeses?

04:44.492 --> 04:45.368
Guy Fawkeses?

04:45.451 --> 04:46.536
Can you get me
guys like that?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.580
You bet your balls I can get you
some Guy Fawkeses.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.293
Don't hold your balls.
I would not hold my balls on that one.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.670
- <i>And finally, Michael returned...</i>
- Where's Buster?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.088
<i>- ...without the guest of honor.</i>
- Don't you have him?

04:57.171 --> 05:00.633
No. I went to the jail to pick him up,
and no one there has seen him

05:00.717 --> 05:01.676
since the parade.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.637
Now, you did let him know
he was being released, right?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.223
Well, I'm sure they told him
at the jail after the parade.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.977
Mother Bluth,
I think you might be interested in this.

05:11.060 --> 05:14.272
<i>Oh, speaking of maniacs,</i>
<i>let's watch this again.</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:17.859
<i>That's a real criminal
inside that makeshift jail cell.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:19.944
<i>- It's a jailbreak.</i>
<i>- You know, it's my...</i>

05:20.028 --> 05:21.446
Is that Oscar?

05:21.529 --> 05:22.989
Well, it's not you!

05:23.281 --> 05:25.450
Who even told Oscar Buster was in jail?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.785
<i>Oscar was told by Barry,</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:29.829
<i>who had driven down to Mexico</i>

05:29.912 --> 05:32.498
<i>- and thought he was talking to George.</i>
- You <i>are </i> here!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.417
I came down here to warn you
that the cops want you

05:34.500 --> 05:36.919
to lead them to the stair car,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.547
because that's the evidence
that's gonna keep Buster in jail.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.383
Buster's in jail? My boy. My boy.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.761
<i>And so, Oscar used the parade</i>

05:44.844 --> 05:48.264
<i>as cover
for breaking Buster out of prison,</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:50.350
<i>knocking Stan Sitwell out
in the process.</i>

05:50.433 --> 05:51.434
Dad? Dad!

05:52.393 --> 05:54.645
So they escaped
from prison a half hour

05:54.729 --> 05:56.522
before he was gonna be
legally released?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.400
- No one told him.
- He's got a lot of spunk.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.777
I like that on a guy.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.529
If Oscar is with Buster,
then where is Lucille 2?

06:03.613 --> 06:06.741
I mean, she could be dead,
and Buster will be charged with murder.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.451
Or worse, she could come back,

06:08.534 --> 06:10.328
and they would charge us
with embezzlement.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.080
Okay. Buster thinks
he's broken out of prison.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.289
God knows what he's gonna do.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.791
Well, somebody has to find him.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.626
You're the cause of it,
and he does respond

06:16.709 --> 06:18.628
- to your scent.
- I'll go with you,

06:18.711 --> 06:20.797
and we will find our son together,

06:20.880 --> 06:24.675
and perhaps we will find each other
along the way.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.345
Why don't you find some money
along the way

06:27.428 --> 06:29.305
to make up for the land you lost
in Mexico?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.266
Father, Mother, please.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.519
Our whole family is in crisis.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.271
For I have seen what happens
when families turn on each other.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.607
Just as I found my son, I lost him.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.944
And just as I lost my wife,
I... I found my replacement wife,

06:43.027 --> 06:45.029
but then I... I lost her.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.907
I... I have nobody.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.160
Well, you got me, Dad.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.829
Not now, Maeby.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.998
I have... what? Like, one person.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.334
Click.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.878
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:03.798
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

07:03.881 --> 07:05.508
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

07:11.514 --> 07:13.724
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.315
<i>George Sr. had again been rejected
by his wife.</i>

07:21.399 --> 07:24.569
<i>And, feeling low, he decided
to get his affairs in order.</i>

07:24.652 --> 07:26.404
...you're trying to keep your distance
from the company,

07:26.487 --> 07:29.824
and I appreciate that,
but you are the copresident with Gob.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.493
Well, hang on. President?
When did I become president?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.871
Well, I mean, Sudden Valley.
I mean, that's yours.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.373
- I mean, we're carrying that for you.
- You forgave the debt.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.792
We <i>forgot </i> the debt.

07:39.876 --> 07:44.630
Basically, what we did
was we absorbed everything, including you.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.841
And does Gob know
that we're copresidents?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.843
Gob doesn't know
that there's a B

07:48.926 --> 07:51.637
- in the word "debt."
- If you're gonna run the Bluth Company,

07:51.721 --> 07:52.597
that word's gonna come up.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.724
Go into the company,
you look at the books,

07:54.807 --> 07:57.310
you get in there, you find out
if there's any money.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.188
I need an evaluation.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.981
Yeah, that's an understatement.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.900
All right.
You know I'd really like to be involved,

08:03.983 --> 08:05.568
but I can't risk being involved
in anything

08:05.651 --> 08:07.487
- that might be illegal.
- Agreed.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.572
- That's what Gob is for.
- Boy, I was really hoping

08:09.655 --> 08:11.157
you were gonna say
there's nothing illegal.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.995
It's the last thing
you'll ever need to do for me.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.625
- You heard a yes?
- Thank you.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.711
- <i>Meanwhile, Tobias...</i>
- Kudos on being so quiet.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.714
<i>...checked in with the family
who hadn't abandoned him,</i>

08:26.797 --> 08:28.049
<i>but were hiding in the attic.</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:31.511
I've got slices of stale gummy bear,
hard candies and a spare rib.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.260
- Ooh, I'll take that spare rib.
- Could I have the spare rib?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.931
Just joshing. It's stale gummy bear.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.265
Oh...

08:36.349 --> 08:38.267
Sounded like you were having fun
down there.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.227
Oh.

08:39.308 --> 08:41.729
It takes a lot out of me,
but they like to look at me

08:41.812 --> 08:45.274
as the sticky white glue
that holds the family together.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.818
But now... you're my family.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.656
My biological son
and my pathological girlfriend.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.283
And as the provider of this family,
I promise...

08:54.492 --> 08:57.787
nay, vow that you will always have
a roof over... Ow!

08:57.870 --> 08:59.872
- Dad, are you okay?
- Roof balls! Jesus, quiet.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.499
- You're gonna get us kicked out.
- Sorry.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.209
Okay, I just think we're all

09:03.292 --> 09:06.087
a little stressed right now,
being stuck in this attic.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.590
Are you sure we can't just live
downstairs in the real house?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.926
Oh, this isn't a real house.
This is a model house.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.220
How long
do we have to stay here?

09:14.303 --> 09:16.764
Just until I can support us
on my actor salary.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.474
- Oh...
- Quiet.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.309
You can be excited, but quietly.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.525
Oh, no...

09:27.608 --> 09:29.944
<i>Meanwhile, Oscar,</i>
<i>who was on the run with his son,</i>

09:30.027 --> 09:33.114
<i>knew that he had to get rid
of a vehicle that approximated</i>

09:33.197 --> 09:35.449
<i>the very one the police were looking for.</i>

09:35.533 --> 09:38.536
Well, I know I left
my truck somewhere around here.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.121
All right, I guess we should get out.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.249
I probably shouldn't
have chained us together.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.084
No, no,
I should've brought a key,

09:45.167 --> 09:46.961
but actually, I think it helps sell

09:47.044 --> 09:48.754
the whole Keystone Cop thing,
because it had

09:48.838 --> 09:50.339
to be something crazy.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.843
Because, you know,
in silent movies, it's not real life.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.387
- No.
- All right. So what do you think? Ready?

09:56.470 --> 09:58.514
- Mm-hmm, okay. let's go.
- All right. Here we go.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.891
Oh.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.728
I guess stuffdoes happen like this
in real life.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.479
- Can you... Easy peasy.
- Go out your side.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.189
Easy peasy.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.317
Well, that wasn't so difficult.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.985
- No.
- Or funny.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.571
Keystone Cops would've made a meal
out of this.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.656
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right. Watch your hand.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.241
Watching.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.411
Are you okay?

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
Wait a minute. It's a fake hand.
How can it hurt?

10:23.497 --> 10:26.876
No, it's a rental from prison,
and Mother said my next hand...

10:26.959 --> 10:28.961
- All right.
- ...is gonna be out of my own pocket...

10:29.045 --> 10:30.963
Okay, wait. What's that over there?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.715
It says Mother of God hospital.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.925
Maybe we can get you a replacement.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.803
But first, we gotta get
out of these prison clothes.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.474
- All right.
- Okay.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.768
Here's the deal.
We need a walking system

10:43.851 --> 10:45.311
- so we don't just trip over each other.
- Yeah.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.105
- Left, right. Left, right.
- Okay.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.650
So we always start with left.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.026
Smooth and easy.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.112
Lemon squeezy. And...

10:55.196 --> 10:56.614
...left...

10:56.697 --> 10:58.532
<i>It wasn't a good system.</i>

10:58.949 --> 11:01.702
<i>But Oscar wasn't the only twin
that was down,</i>

11:01.786 --> 11:04.997
<i>because as Michael headed out
to keep the company alive...</i>

11:06.499 --> 11:09.710
<i>he realized he'd need to do
the same for its founder.</i>

11:11.420 --> 11:13.255
What are you doing with the hose?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.926
Wha... No, I didn't know it was on.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.887
I mean,
I would never purposefully run a car

11:19.970 --> 11:22.556
with the garage door closed
with the family in crisis.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.059
Okay. You know, Dad,
this is an electric car.

11:25.142 --> 11:25.976
Oh.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.437
So, the only thing
you're killing is my battery.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.608
Is that funny? I... Oh, God,
I can't get anything right.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.695
Meanwhile, your mother is banging
every beach rat

11:35.778 --> 11:37.238
that ever dropped out of a race.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.533
- <i>George was referring to this man...</i>
- Oh, hi.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.993
Care to join me for a glass
of breakfast wine?

11:43.077 --> 11:46.080
<i>...with whom Lucille found
she had much in common.</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:47.206
Dusty!

11:48.082 --> 11:50.710
<i>I mean, she wouldn't go out</i>
<i>with me this afternoon,</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:52.628
<i>- and I know it's because of him.</i>
<i>- Dad,</i>

11:52.837 --> 11:55.589
I think you might be giving up,
uh, a little too easy.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.592
You know? I mean, Mom loves you.
She's just mad at you. You cheated on her.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.053
Or Uncle Oscar did, I don't know.
I lost the thread

12:01.137 --> 12:02.888
on that one,
but she's probably just trying

12:02.972 --> 12:05.725
to make you jealous, and so...
You're the head of the family,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.643
- give her something that she wants.
- Wha...

12:07.727 --> 12:10.062
Are you saying that
I should go find Buster?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.939
Show her you're a good dad.
You know,

12:12.022 --> 12:14.024
besides, he's gonna need
to be found and told

12:14.108 --> 12:17.778
he's free before he does something illegal
and ends up back in prison.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.531
- Ah. Maybe Lucille will...
- You know? -Uh-huh.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.949
I don't know, let me back in.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.493
Boy, you have to have
balls of steel

12:24.618 --> 12:26.412
to survive in a hole like that.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.873
And the same could be said for prison.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.462
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>Michael was going over the books</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:37.423
<i>in what Gob had turned
into the conference room.</i>

12:37.840 --> 12:40.009
"Joni Beard, Media Consultant."

12:40.092 --> 12:41.844
20K? What's that?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.679
K means thousand.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.600
Can you believe Adhir
just expected me to know that?

12:47.683 --> 12:50.978
I must've told him K times,
"You gotta help me with these things."

12:51.061 --> 12:53.147
I used to train dogs, so I'm very patient.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.816
And $10,000 for a printer?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.152
- 10K.
- Good Gob. Good K.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.279
Yeah.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.532
And to be fair, it's a...
It was a 3-D printer.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.159
Why do we need a 3-D printer?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.703
Well, to be fair,
it's a 3-D dental printer.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.080
But they're worth twice what I got them
to leave them here for.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.000
They must've been too slow for them,
but I thought, what do we care

13:13.083 --> 13:15.419
if it takes two and a half hours
to print some molars?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.338
Can you just get me a copy of the receipt?

13:17.421 --> 13:19.256
Hey, you want to spend a couple
hundred bucks on a 3-D receipt,

13:19.340 --> 13:21.801
I'll have it printed
and in your mouth before sunset.

13:21.884 --> 13:22.802
These are your purchases.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.970
- Where are you getting your capital?
- Capital money.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.264
Thank you.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.434
I have all the books here.
Coming through.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.645
Including the ones Gob can't look at.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.147
Do you want the Austero-Bluth
or just the Bluth books?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.358
Well, I can only look at the Bluth books.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.402
The Austero books are
for British eyes only, as they say.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.781
<i>♪ For British eyes only ♪</i>

13:44.406 --> 13:46.242
Okay. Uh, well, as copresident,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.661
- I can look at the books that he can't.
- All right.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.830
I'm sorry I don't understand what...
No, I ju...

13:50.913 --> 13:53.415
Michael, if, look,
I'm the copresident, okay?

13:53.499 --> 13:56.794
There's only room at this company
for one copresident.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.547
What's next? You're gonna want
one of my parking spaces, Michael?

13:59.630 --> 14:01.966
I didn't know
that I was copresident myself.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.010
All right? I'm just here to help.
I'm not going to trump you.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.097
Oh, well, Michael, don't worry,
'cause I already went there.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.265

14:09.348 --> 14:11.141
<i>Saturday and Sunday semester.</i>

14:11.392 --> 14:13.769
Best 17K Mom and Dad ever spent.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.690
Anyway, I don't know why I'm not allowed
to look at the Austero books, but, uh,

14:17.773 --> 14:20.609
Mom does allow me to make
purchases from that account.

14:22.027 --> 14:22.903
Let me get this straight.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.322
You're only allowed to spend money
from the Austero account.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.365
Why are all the revenue

14:26.448 --> 14:28.951
from these investments only showing up
in the Bluth books?

14:29.034 --> 14:31.453
Would you be terribly offended
if I offered you a candy?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.039
- I don't think Dad wanted me to see this.
- I don't, either.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.459
And your mother has my passport,
so why don't we say that I was never here?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.670
An absolute professional
pleasure to have met you.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.256
You know, I think that they had a plan

14:42.339 --> 14:44.800
that they were sure would work,
but now they need to get out,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.970
and that's why he wants
an evaluation of all the assets.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.513
- Good to see you.
- You're doing great.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.682
Yeah, he wants to find out
what he can sell off.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.560
And you know, since you're copresident,
your name's all over this.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.438
That means that whatever trouble
Dad is responsible for,

14:57.521 --> 14:58.939
you are also responsible for.

14:59.315 --> 15:04.028
So you're telling me
that Dad thinks I'm responsible.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.614
Maybe it's time to show them
you <i>are </i> responsible.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.531
Yeah.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.951
That you're not looking for some reward
for doing the right thing.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.454
- Or any reward.
- Good Gob.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.540
Oh, thanks, buddy.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.877
They think I'm too stupid to...

15:20.502 --> 15:21.420
Help yourself.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.341
Yeah. You know what's funny?

15:25.674 --> 15:27.509
They think that I'm too stup...

15:29.386 --> 15:31.931
- I already had one in there, so...
- We got to face facts.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.807
They're stuck.
These stick. They're stickers...

15:33.891 --> 15:35.935
Knowing what we know, we are complicit,

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
which leaves us open to... to liability.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.857
You know, the easy choice
would be to quit.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.400
- There it is.
- We've got an opportunity

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
to save the company.
That would not be easy.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.072
That... that would take sacrifice.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.199
Maybe even burning the...

15:50.991 --> 15:52.743
well, midweek oil.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.787
I quit.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.165
I shouldn't have called it
the easy choice.

15:58.832 --> 16:02.294
<i>And Oscar and Buster found their way</i>
<i>to the hospital, having improved</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:04.964

Now, we cannot draw attention
to ourselves.

- Right.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.183

16:17.935 --> 16:19.979

16:27.486 --> 16:28.320
No way.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.281
I think I saw William Shatner
wearing this

16:31.365 --> 16:33.409
- while riding a bicycle once.
- Yeah.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.578
Why don't you try this one? This one.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.288
- This one?
- Yeah.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.833
- I think this is used for teaching.
- Doesn't matter. Who cares?

16:40.916 --> 16:42.751
It sort of reminds me
of Mother's hand,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.129
except it's less veiny, and warmer.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.694
Okay, yes, well, anyway,
why don't we go over some expenses?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.199
Yes, yes, thank you
for reminding me. I, um...

17:14.281 --> 17:16.535
...I told some paid protesters

17:16.617 --> 17:19.038
that we use that, um, they could bill us.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.124
You know,
it's for my nephew. Um...

17:22.207 --> 17:24.084
They're gonna be buying
some masks as well, so...

17:24.166 --> 17:25.294
They're Guy Fawkeses.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.046
So those are personal expenses.

17:27.127 --> 17:30.299
No, I just told you,
they're for my nephew. D...

17:30.841 --> 17:33.385
Got it. I'll let Michael know
they're non-business related.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.762
Don't worry about Michael.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.430
He should've thought of that
before he fired me.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.640
Probably for being gay, too.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.560
You do know
that Michael didn't fire you, you quit.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.521
As any proud gay man would do
in the face of such bigotry.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.984
But I guess I don't need to tell that
to a little Indian guy, huh?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
Michael's not your friend either.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.488
You should've seen
the look on his face

of you. You know...

17:54.656 --> 17:55.991
What's the problem with Apu?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.202
Just one more thing
before I have security drag you out.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.162
Why are you claiming that

18:00.245 --> 18:02.831
the closet conversion company
was a religious write-off?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.625
Because I went there to become straight.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.126
I thought it was one
of those Christian places

18:06.210 --> 18:08.045
that converts gay men and is, uh...

18:08.128 --> 18:09.755
Now the sole province

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
of extreme fundamentalist
Christian derangement.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.968
Oh, you're just mad
'cause you can't have a hamburger.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.428
But, yes.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.057
Those places don't work.
There's no such thing as a program

18:20.140 --> 18:22.267
that can change someone.
It's a way for hypocrites

18:22.351 --> 18:23.268
to try to convince the world

18:23.352 --> 18:26.355
- that they're now straight.
- Without using magic.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.900
So I just tell the world that I'm gay,
and that I'm going to one of those?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.902
And then I come out straight.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.321
Mm, well, if you really do identify
as a gay man,

18:34.404 --> 18:37.825
I would say going to a place like that
will only make you miserable.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.618
So, shall I arrange an Uber for you?

18:44.748 --> 18:47.334
I didn't understand a word
you just said, little guy.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.211
<i>But George Michael, meanwhile,</i>

18:49.294 --> 18:51.880
<i>was worried that his uncle had failed
to set up the protesters.</i>

18:51.964 --> 18:54.508
You know Betty White
has this same car?

18:54.591 --> 18:57.594
- You know Betty White?
- We share a weed dealer.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.638
<i>We are Anonymous.</i>

18:59.721 --> 19:00.556
Oh, shoot, not again.

19:00.639 --> 19:04.268
My tech guys think
that I've been hacked by Anonymous.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.186
I don't mean the alkies,
I mean the, uh,

19:06.270 --> 19:09.106
the guys who wear the creepy masks,
hang out online.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.691
The Guy Fawkeses.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.693
Really? That sounded like you.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.612
Think so?
God, they can even do that now.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.866
Well, all the more reason
to not get you mixed up in all this.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.161
You know, online hacking I can deal with,
it's just the day that they show up

19:22.244 --> 19:23.453
in person that I'm dreading.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.623
But you can't live in fear, so...
let's go.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.333
Whatever happens, happens.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.044
<i>But two other Bluths </i> were <i>living</i>
<i>in fear,</i>

19:31.128 --> 19:32.504
<i>and perhaps that's why</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
<i>they soon found themselves entangled</i>

19:34.464 --> 19:36.800
<i>with an old friend...</i>

19:36.884 --> 19:38.552
Oh, that hurt.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.345
<i>...whom they soon recognized.</i>

19:40.429 --> 19:43.265
I'm sorry, sir. Are you... Stan Sitwell?

19:43.348 --> 19:44.975
<i>Who was immediately fearful.</i>

19:45.058 --> 19:46.310
Oh, my God, George Bluth.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.896
- Shh. I'm not George Bluth.
- Act like we're strangers.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.189
- Yeah.
- Please don't hurt me.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.399
I don't want any trouble.
I'm getting out of here today.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.943
Oh, I know how you feel.
I broke out of prison today.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.111
Hey, uh, Stan?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.280
Could we stay at your place?

19:58.822 --> 20:01.033
You're taking me as a hostage
in case the cops see us?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.076
Hey, guy, I wouldn't know about that.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.578
- We can pretend we're cousins.
- Cousins?

20:04.661 --> 20:05.787
Yes.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.457
Yeah, Cousin Stan, let's walk, okay?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.666
Inside, outside,

20:09.750 --> 20:11.043
inside, outside...

20:11.126 --> 20:13.170
Right behind you, cousin-father.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.718
<i>And George Michael</i>
<i>arrived at Fakeblock,</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:22.179
<i>ready to act afraid of the Guy Fawkeses.</i>

20:22.804 --> 20:25.224
- When do we want it?
- Stop tracking us!

20:25.307 --> 20:28.352
- Make a chain!
- This is all on me.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.562
- We're still protesting!
- Oh.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.523
You hired a bunch
of foxy guys to protest me

20:33.607 --> 20:36.652
because I said I hated hot guys.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.695
"Rebel." "Unfair."

20:38.779 --> 20:40.739
- I was reading that as rebel.
- Oh, my God,

20:40.822 --> 20:43.659
- it's Rebel Alley. We love you.
- Oh.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.244
Yes, I went as you
for Halloween last year.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.120
- Can we get a picture?
- Do you mind?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.664
<i>Dangerous Cousins</i>
is my favorite movie.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.624
- Mine t...
- I will.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.751
I want to see everything else
you've got inside. Come on.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.919
Might not be anybody in there.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.129
They wouldn't have crossed
the picket lines.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.131
Oh, well, you never know with nerds.
Come on.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.259
If you want to see a big
empty room, we'll take a look,

21:00.342 --> 21:03.095
but uh, just... I just know my guys.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.014
<i>But George Michael</i>
<i>was in for another surprise.</i>

21:07.224 --> 21:09.434
Yeah.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.689
Oh, my goodness.
Fakeblock is so impressive.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.691
- Yeah.
- I mean, Fakeblock's incredible.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.734
- Fakeblock is...
- Yeah, Fakeblock is real.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.905
It's my place.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.617
<i>And back at the cottage,</i>
<i>Lucille was in</i>

21:25.701 --> 21:27.536
<i>for a surprise as well.</i>

21:29.162 --> 21:32.666
Lucille, my lady, my love.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.835
Do you remember our first date,

21:34.918 --> 21:36.920
at that little Italian restaurant?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.755
Do you remember what I said to you?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.133
"How did I ever find you?"

21:41.633 --> 21:46.722
<i>♪ How did I ever find you? ♪</i>

21:48.598 --> 21:52.185
You took me for Chinese.
The Italian place was the first time

21:52.269 --> 21:55.355
I caught you with your secretary,
and you asked,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.316
"How did you ever find <i>me?"</i>

21:57.649 --> 22:01.778
<i>♪ How did you ever find me? ♪</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:03.989
That's it. All right. Get out.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.615
Go back to the Macaroni Grill.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.077
I, uh, also brought you some leftovers.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.955
I'm busy, George. What do you want?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.460
I want you, Lucille.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.879
In what way, George?

22:19.421 --> 22:20.464
Sexually?

22:20.547 --> 22:21.465
Yes.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.342
Sexual-ish-ly.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.178
Look, here's the deal.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.890
- I can't... get hard. I...
- Live without me.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.018
It's really getting hard,
uh, to live without you.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.938
We really need each other right now,
because Buster

22:37.022 --> 22:39.691
is on the lam. His first prison break.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.318
I remember when he just started talking.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.320
He better not have started talking.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.365
No, I meant originally.
Like, when he was three.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.200
- Five.
- Five.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.993
He didn't say a word
until we fired the wet nurse.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.871
He didn't stop talking
about that for three years.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.500
- Until we caved.
- You see, this is the stuff.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.835
That makes life worth living?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.838
I was actually gonna say
that we should keep from the DA,

23:01.922 --> 23:04.591
but can you tell me
why life is worth living again?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.843
See, that's just it.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.888
- I'm trying to have some kind of a life.
- Mm.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.724
With Dustin Radler, the beach rat.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.726
What's the deal?
You in love with this guy?

23:14.810 --> 23:16.895
We're having fun, George.

23:16.978 --> 23:18.688
Because he's fun.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.441
He loves music, he plays me songs
on the guitar.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.442
You know, hey,

23:22.609 --> 23:25.195
I just brought the assistant manager

23:25.278 --> 23:28.865
of the Macaroni Grill
over here during his lunch shift.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.534
It set me back a sawbuck.

23:30.617 --> 23:34.121
It's a third of what you are giving me
to live off these days.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.332
Yeah, that's another thing
Dusty doesn't complain about,

23:37.541 --> 23:38.417
his allowance.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.252
You give him an allowance?

23:40.335 --> 23:42.838
He doesn't get one. He's very wealthy.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.923
He made a lot of money
in his law career.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.509
And he's fun. He surfs.

23:47.592 --> 23:51.430
He does things. He's alive, George.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.390
I'm alive.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.642
Only because Michael drives
an electric car.

23:56.017 --> 24:00.647
Trust me, the whole
"trying to kill yourself" thing, turn off.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.315
I think I need to show you

24:02.399 --> 24:06.570
that I am a fun guy who likes to laugh

24:06.653 --> 24:09.990
and is open to not killing himself.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.242
I don't call it that,
I call it "a cry for help,"

24:12.325 --> 24:14.828
but I think help has just arrived
and it's saying,

24:14.911 --> 24:17.956
- "Cry for fun!"
- Don't cry at all.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.375
Don't cry. Don't die.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.586
And have some fun.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.088
Wow, thank you.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.132
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to the beach now.

24:27.215 --> 24:31.011
I'm gonna have a ball!

24:32.971 --> 24:35.390
I don't know what's going on,
but I feel like a 55-year-old.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.517
Well, so do I.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.728
And he's showing up to take me
out for dinner later,

24:39.811 --> 24:41.188
so I need to get ready.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.984
Okay. Well... don't cry.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.571
Don't die. And have some fun.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.366
Hurt people, hurt people.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.205
<i>On the next</i>

Don't die!

25:25.398 --> 25:27.359
Don't cry, don't die.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.736
It sounds like he said,
"Don't help me."

25:29.819 --> 25:31.696
- I heard, "Help me die."
- Excuse me!

25:31.780 --> 25:33.698
Either way,
it looks like he's having fun.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.576
- I'm gonna die.
- No maritime law against that.

Oh! Hey, we got dolphins.

tons of cigarettes
until you're like, "Oh, no,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.483
no more, no more..."
You know what I mean?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.236
- I don't want you to think I'm a whore.
- No.

No one would suggest that. Um,
