00:09.217 --> 00:11.302
Are we in Paris?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.346
Yeah.
(chuckles)

00:13.388 --> 00:16.057
I just picked up
some croissants for breakfast.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.393
Mm.
Fresh ones.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.937
And are we gonna stroll
by the Seine later

00:20.979 --> 00:23.732
and make out on a
bridge at sunset?

00:23.773 --> 00:25.567
Definitely.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.987
Liar.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.949
Not about
the making out part.
Mm-hmm.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.752

Yes.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.562

You'll get a formal briefing,

but you saw the news about
those people on Belle Isle?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.285
Yeah, some kind of protest.
Got out of hand.

That's the story we're
letting the press run with,

are all missing persons cases

04:21.010 --> 04:22.804
from the last couple decades.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.848
Okay, so, what, they're all,
like, kidnapped and returned?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.100
Unlikely.

together teams

04:36.401 --> 04:37.944
of corrections officers

04:40.738 --> 04:42.907
We've just been battling this

to keep it out of the press

04:44.284 --> 04:46.160
until we have any kind
of handle on it.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.996
Well, in my experience,
people lie when they get caught

04:48.037 --> 04:50.123
doing things
they aren't supposed to.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.750

Something doesn't add up.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.616
I'm Reverend Johnston. Isaiah.

Inherited the position.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.457
Jesus is our family business.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.792
Well, hopefully Jesus can
provide you with some insight.

whoever is in charge.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.785

09:05.920 --> 09:07.255
You would think...

09:07.296 --> 09:10.258
Mm-hmm. All this talk
about the future.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.345
You know, my husband and I
have been jailed and worse

09:14.387 --> 09:16.347
for organizing the vote
for Negroes.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.433
If it was really 2021,

09:19.475 --> 09:21.811
I'd have hoped
we'd made more progress.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.646
(exhales)

09:23.688 --> 09:25.773
That it wouldn't feel the same.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.067
(footsteps approaching)

09:33.739 --> 09:35.157
I was driving to work.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.535
My first day back
after maternity leave.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.662
And then suddenly,
there was this,

09:39.704 --> 09:41.747
like, wind.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.250
And I saw a green light
out of my window,

09:44.292 --> 09:45.793
and then everything
went black.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.129
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.
You said you saw a light?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.964
Like, a green light?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.632
Yeah.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.968
And now 16 years have passed?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.469
SHANICE:
I'm not lying.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.513
I'm speaking without counsel

09:57.555 --> 09:59.599
because something strange
happened.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.392
I've cooperated,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.936
and you all have told me nothing
about what I'm being accused of.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.563
We're trying to get
to the truth.
The truth is

10:05.605 --> 10:07.398
that I just want to go home.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.447
Please, my-my daughter, Mariah,

10:14.488 --> 10:16.449
she's only four months old.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.075
JHARREL:
I hear you. All
right, and we are

10:18.117 --> 10:20.369
working as fast as we can
to figure this out.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.246
All right, we have a
bunch of people working

10:22.288 --> 10:24.540
across the dozens of facilities
that are housing all of you.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
Oh, my God,
that could take days.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.419
Weeks.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.922
And you're not gonna let me
see them, are you?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.217

10:41.724 --> 10:43.309
Bathroom's down the
end of the hall.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.978
They're giving everybody
ten minutes, okay?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.778
You okay?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.864
No.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.699
STEVE:
Oh, okay.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.992
I've never been apart
from my baby

11:00.034 --> 11:02.703
for more than a few hours.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.623
She must be so scared.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.834

Um,

11:08.876 --> 11:10.795
I'm Shanice, by the way.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.171
Mildred.
(chuckles softly)

11:12.213 --> 11:14.715
And I'm sorry.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.676
You seem like a good mom.

I just want to

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
I know, right?

13:00.529 --> 13:02.114
I don't know how parents
let their kids go out

13:02.156 --> 13:03.991
in the world and treat
people like that.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.494
This seems to be a pattern among
people who look a lot like you.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.703
Fair.

sure that my kid

13:23.260 --> 13:24.762
You want to get coffee?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.597
I'm a little busy right now.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.432
And I'm not really trying
to discuss kids.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.850
That's a long ways off for me.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.644
That right?

13:31.685 --> 13:33.479
That's right.
I am getting my law degree,

14:05.845 --> 14:09.598
We've interviewed 15 people
so far and gotten nowhere.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.392
Well, we know that
they all cleared

14:11.433 --> 14:12.768
their medical screenings.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.103
They don't pose a
danger to anyone.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.855
But we don't know that.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.481
Are we supposed to believe
these people don't remember

14:17.523 --> 14:19.400
anything
about what happened to them?
Keisha,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.318
they're just as confused
as we are.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.029
All right? We should help them.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.823
Tell the public,
alert family members.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.283
Tell the public what?

14:27.324 --> 14:29.034
Some people got snatched up
by a green light

14:29.076 --> 14:31.036
and just showed back up
out of nowhere? No.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.913
There's something
we're missing.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.499
Okay, and how long
until we have answers?

14:35.541 --> 14:38.752
In the meantime, we are leaving
a lot of people out there

14:38.794 --> 14:40.880
believing that their loved
ones are never coming home

14:40.921 --> 14:43.674
when, really, we got them
locked up here in this hotel.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.760

You haven't spoken a word

15:09.575 --> 15:12.703
I will need to find
new bandages.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.458
This is remarkable.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.253
It's almost fully healed.
How did this happen?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.588
Did you receive treatment
from their doctors?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.965
No, I didn't.
(chuckles softly)

15:25.925 --> 15:27.801
I-I think I should...
Oh, no.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.470
No, I'm fine.
(chuckles)

15:29.511 --> 15:31.430
It mustn't have been so
bad after all. (chuckles)

15:31.472 --> 15:33.933
Go on, now. You got other
patients who need you.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.700
Do you know sign language?

15:53.535 --> 15:55.204
(knock on door)

16:03.379 --> 16:05.422
What's going on?
We have a problem.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.758
Shanice Murray escaped.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.136
I bet she's heading home.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.152
Logan, please come out!

Someone's
breaking into my house.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.198

Owner just called the cops.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.980

She's close.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.691
And she's got no place
to stay. Cold night.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.109
She'll find a place
that's open late.

diner down the street.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.411
Hey.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.871
Where do you think
you're going?

17:18.912 --> 17:20.956

17:48.609 --> 17:51.612
Mrs. Grover,
you-you changed my diapers,

17:51.653 --> 17:55.074
did my hair and fed me
every day after school.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.367
Plus, I know that shotgun's
about a hundred years old,

17:57.409 --> 17:59.620
and you're gonna hurt yourself
if you try to shoot me.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.455
(dog barks in distance)

18:04.166 --> 18:05.584
Neecey?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.544
That you?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.713
Come on in here out of the cold.
You're gonna

18:09.755 --> 18:12.257
catch your death.
(laughs)

18:12.299 --> 18:16.053

18:16.095 --> 18:18.430

18:18.472 --> 18:21.100
Look, any sign of Manny at the
facility you were assigned to?

18:22.810 --> 18:24.561
All right, hit me up
if you find anything.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.021
Thanks.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.190
(sighs)

18:38.158 --> 18:39.451
CLAUDETTE:
They say this is
like a soda pop?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.245
You just poke a hole in it?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.956
Guess the government couldn't
spring for the real thing.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.625
You pull the tab
on the top. Here.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.003

18:50.045 --> 18:51.797

18:53.966 --> 18:55.843

Well, I'll be.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.803
It's all bubbly
like just from the fountain.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.972
Yes, ma'am.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.891
Keep the line moving.
Let's go.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.536
I told them I am
a sometime pescatarian,

19:22.578 --> 19:23.996
ovo vegetarian.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.123
Like, what is so
complicated about that?

19:26.165 --> 19:30.085
Oh, my God.
Do you even speak English?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.715
Oh, my God.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.385
I have called home,

19:38.427 --> 19:40.971
his office, his cell phone.
All disconnected.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.848
How am I gonna
track them down?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.850
I couldn't find
your-your phone book.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.269
The city stopped
putting those out years ago.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.563
Oh, my gosh.
But I wrote down

19:49.605 --> 19:52.816
the new address when they
moved out to Palmer Woods.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.943
Palmer Woods?
Mm-hmm.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.445
Uh,

19:56.486 --> 19:59.156
what's the address?
Can I borrow the Pontiac?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.908
The car is gone.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.619
And there is not
much more you can do

20:03.660 --> 20:06.079
until you get some sleep.
No, I have to...

20:06.121 --> 20:07.789
You're dead on your feet.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.417
You're talking nonsense
and don't even know it.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.628
Come on, now.
Drink your Vernors.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.093
Rest up,

20:20.135 --> 20:23.430
and you can find your
husband in the morning.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.767
A few more hours ain't
gonna change anything

20:26.808 --> 20:28.227
now that you're back.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.896
I'm glad to see

20:30.938 --> 20:33.357
you're not too much
like your daddy after all.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.900
I'm nothing like him.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.735
I didn't leave.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.487
I...

20:38.528 --> 20:40.906
I don't know what happened.
I wa...

20:40.948 --> 20:43.450
(chuckles):
I was home yesterday.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.702
I just want to close my eyes

20:45.744 --> 20:48.372
and have everything return
to normal.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.915
I mean, if I... if...

20:49.957 --> 20:51.833
If I can just see Logan

20:51.875 --> 20:55.545
and-and...
and hug my little baby...

20:56.838 --> 20:58.757
It'll be okay.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.759
I know it will.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.552
It has to be.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.076
(toilet flushes)

21:29.621 --> 21:32.040
Well, damn. Lurk much?

21:34.543 --> 21:35.961
(faucet running)
Can I help you?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.588
Yes. Yes. I want you to cut me.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.173
Oh, my God.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.968
Um, lady, look,
I know this is all a hot mess,

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
but are you okay?

21:44.428 --> 21:45.470
They won't give us
anything sharp,

21:45.512 --> 21:46.805
so I need to use your nails.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
Absolutely not.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.183
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for these?

21:50.225 --> 21:51.601
I just want to
test a theory.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.815
Do it, and I won't tell
that guard you're sweet on

21:56.857 --> 21:58.817
that you just made
yourself sick in here.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.819
That's none
of your business.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.822
No, it surely isn't.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.200
Fine.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.706
Ew. Ew.
(inhales sharply)

22:12.748 --> 22:14.207
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
(grunts)

22:14.249 --> 22:15.917
Oh, my God.
(exhales)

22:15.959 --> 22:17.919
(faucet running)

22:17.961 --> 22:19.671
Well, thank you kindly,

22:19.713 --> 22:21.506
and you have a nice day now,
you hear?

22:21.548 --> 22:23.717
I'm sorry, wait a minute.
That's it?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.720
I mean, like, you're not gonna
bleed out, are you?

22:26.762 --> 22:28.680
'Cause I am not trying to go
down for murder in a bathroom,

22:28.722 --> 22:30.223
so...
I...

22:30.265 --> 22:32.351
(breathing shakily)

22:47.366 --> 22:49.159
ANDRE: Madam. Mrs. Williams,
you mustn't...

22:51.078 --> 22:52.788
But how can that be?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.289
(chuckles softly)

22:55.248 --> 22:57.876
Is this some medical advance
from this era?

22:57.918 --> 22:59.920
Nope, because I tried it,

22:59.961 --> 23:01.296
and it still stings.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.799
But-but hers healed up
even faster this time.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.342
I don't know how
to explain it,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.427
but I just started
feeling better.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.639
Gradually more and more,
a-and now...

23:10.680 --> 23:13.308
Now I feel great.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.519
(chuckles)
Well, that makes one of us.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.063
ANDRE:
I think...

23:18.105 --> 23:22.859
I think this could be
very detrimental to you

23:22.901 --> 23:24.694
and perhaps to all of us
if they found out

23:24.736 --> 23:25.862
about this.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.699
We should not tell anyone else.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.160
(clears throat)

23:33.954 --> 23:36.289
(scoffs)
As if.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.707
You know what? I don't know

23:37.749 --> 23:38.959
what you two weirdos
are talking about,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.377
and I don't care.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.921
(chuckles)
I'm so over all this.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.308
I'm not going back.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.726
Do you understand?

23:56.768 --> 23:59.396
You can't keep me
from them. You have

23:59.438 --> 24:01.106
no legal right.
Whoa, hey, hey.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.524
I agree.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.733
I don't like the
way this thing

24:03.775 --> 24:05.068
is being run, either.
(scoffs)

24:05.110 --> 24:07.154
But I'm not the one in charge.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.530
So...

24:08.572 --> 24:11.324
I'll take you to
see your family.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.410
Look, I'll work it out
with the agents who are

24:13.452 --> 24:15.078
watching the door to
your husband's house.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.747
But you got to return to the
hotel with me afterwards.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.916
Deal?

24:19.958 --> 24:23.003
Why would you help me?

24:23.044 --> 24:24.880
Because if I was your family,

24:24.921 --> 24:28.133
I would give anything
to know that you were okay.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.429
Okay.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.723
This is me.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.351
Weren't you
wearing that yesterday?

24:38.393 --> 24:40.353
(chuckles softly)
Guilty.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.314
(chuckles)
But you definitely
weren't wearing that.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.025
Hey, Mrs. Grover's
sense of fashion is timeless.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.985

Okay! O-Okay, folks.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.104
I know it's been a long
couple of days, and tensions

25:23.146 --> 25:25.148
are high. I feel you
on that, all right?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.693
Now, we know it ain't right
to keep us locked up

25:28.735 --> 25:30.612
when we haven't done
anything wrong.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.199
But we also know that
something strange is going on

25:34.241 --> 25:36.326
because just a
couple days ago,

25:36.368 --> 25:38.245
I was kicking back
watching Jordan

25:38.286 --> 25:40.247
lead the Bulls
in the NBA Finals.

25:40.288 --> 25:43.833
Hector, you had just gotten
back from the Korean War.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.878
And, LaDonna, you were out
at some party. Then suddenly,

25:46.920 --> 25:49.172
you're here.
So unfair.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.676
The government's trying to help.

25:52.717 --> 25:56.096
And I think maybe they can find
a way to show us that.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.764
How about we open up

25:57.806 --> 25:59.516
some of those rooms
for people to have

25:59.558 --> 26:01.601
a real bed to stay in tonight?
JESSICA:
Those floors

26:01.643 --> 26:03.937
are currently closed.
We have some time
before nightfall.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.647
As a gesture.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.065
And tomorrow,

26:07.107 --> 26:08.233
we'll be getting some answers.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.234
That sounds like

26:09.276 --> 26:10.610
a sign of good will to me.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.529
(others agreeing)

26:12.571 --> 26:13.697
For once.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.198
Mm-hmm.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.160
JESSICA:
That's right. We're all trying
to do our best here.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.454
We're blessed in that.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.832
Amen.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.917
(cheering and whooping)

26:30.672 --> 26:32.924
That was well-done
of the reverend.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.801
CLAUDETTE:
That's because he
knows how to use

26:34.843 --> 26:37.095
pretty words
to make people believe him.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.597
Men like him?

26:38.638 --> 26:40.307
They dangerous.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.267
Why would you think that?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.436
Because I'm married to one.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.521
(knock on door)

Mariah?

27:01.703 --> 27:03.580
You're...

27:03.622 --> 27:05.665
Mom?

27:07.042 --> 27:09.836
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.838
It's really you.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.298
You're...

27:13.340 --> 27:15.175
You're really...

27:15.216 --> 27:17.177
You're grown

27:17.218 --> 27:19.346
and...
LOGAN: Mariah, who's at
the door, sweetheart?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.306
Logan?

27:21.348 --> 27:22.557
Oh, thank God.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.808
(chuckles softly)

27:23.850 --> 27:25.644
Shanice?

27:26.936 --> 27:28.813
Hey, get inside.
But-but, Dad, wait.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.148
No, no, please.
LOGAN:
Come on. Come on, all right?

27:31.858 --> 27:33.902
(door closes)
I can't believe it's her.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.321
Um, look, I don't...
I don't have much time,

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
but I had to come
and-and see you.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.033
What are you doing
here, Shanice?

27:40.950 --> 27:42.827
I came to find you.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.371
You wouldn't believe
what I have been through.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.706
I mean,
I-I don't believe it, really,

27:46.748 --> 27:48.208
but Mariah's a teenager,

27:48.249 --> 27:49.793
so...
Do you... Do you
really think

27:49.834 --> 27:51.211
that you can just walk
out on your family

27:51.252 --> 27:53.338
and come waltzing
back 16 years later

27:53.380 --> 27:54.589
like it never happened?

27:54.631 --> 27:56.549
"Walk out"?

27:56.591 --> 27:59.094
That-That's not what happened.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.428
I was taken

28:00.470 --> 28:01.721
or-or something.
I don't actually know.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.515
Wait, who's that?

28:03.556 --> 28:06.351
He's... It's a long story.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.728
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. The...

28:08.770 --> 28:10.855
The day you say I left,
for me,

28:10.897 --> 28:12.691
that was two days
ago. I don't know.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.025
I thought I'd have more time.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.652
Logan, please, I need you
to listen to me.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.112
I need help. We-we all

28:17.153 --> 28:18.571
need help. They're
keeping us in this...

28:18.613 --> 28:20.365
in this hotel downtown.
Wait, who? Who?

28:20.407 --> 28:21.700
There was this agent...
Sir, stand back.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.576
This woman is
a national security threat.

28:23.618 --> 28:24.994
She could pose a danger
to you and your family.
That's not true.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.746
Mariah, stay back.
What is going on?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.373
Oh, my God.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.666
Shanice?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.044
You look just like
your pictures.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.756
KEISHA:
Shanice, you have
to come with us now.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.050
How long?

28:41.010 --> 28:42.721
How long?

28:43.638 --> 28:45.306
Nine years.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.935
And she, she...

28:48.977 --> 28:51.688
She raised my daughter?

28:52.647 --> 28:55.483
(footsteps approaching)

28:55.525 --> 28:57.318
(handcuffs clinking)

28:57.360 --> 28:59.028
Hey. Hey, hang on.
No.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.488
(handcuffs click)
LOGAN:
Don't put your hands on her.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.614
I don't...
I don't know what you thought,

29:01.656 --> 29:02.949
but I did not leave.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.410
I would never have left you.
I love you.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.078
You are my family, and I will do

29:07.120 --> 29:09.122
everything I can
to get back to you

29:09.164 --> 29:10.999
and make you understand.
I don't know what you
got yourself into,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.376
Shanice, but
don't lie to me.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.919
Don't lie to our daughter.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.839
I found your note.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.135
No. No, Logan.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.054
That's not what you think.
I can explain, Logan!

29:25.096 --> 29:27.682
(crying):
Logan! I can explain!

29:27.724 --> 29:30.977
That's not
what you think, Logan!

29:31.019 --> 29:32.937
Logan!

29:38.526 --> 29:40.403
(indistinct chatter over radio)

29:42.447 --> 29:43.865
JHARREL:
Do you have any idea

29:43.907 --> 29:45.492
the destruction you
caused that family?

29:45.533 --> 29:46.659
Why?

29:46.701 --> 29:48.369
I didn't put her
in this position.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.497
You did. Okay? She was never

29:50.538 --> 29:53.416
supposed to make contact.
She was coming in.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.794
Quietly. But instead,

29:55.835 --> 29:57.295
you traumatize the kid,

29:57.337 --> 29:59.255
had to witness her mom
being treated like that.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.216
Someone helped her escape.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.259
What, you think I did that?
I don't know.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.846
But I do know when people
have something to hide.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.557
And I don't trust you.
JHARREL:
Yeah?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.684
Well, you're a cop
who believes in the system

30:11.726 --> 30:14.187
over people's humanity.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.356
I don't really trust you,
either.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.695
(phone vibrates)

30:32.789 --> 30:35.667
Mrs. Murray,
you look unwell.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.794
(crying)
Where have you been?

30:39.087 --> 30:40.547
Are you all right?

30:42.465 --> 30:44.509
Not really, Doc.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.014
My husband...

30:50.056 --> 30:52.225
is now married
to someone else

30:52.267 --> 30:55.812
who also raised
my 16-year-old daughter.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.815
I...

31:05.738 --> 31:08.449
I was so scared
when I got pregnant.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.828
I wasn't ready
to be a mother.

31:12.745 --> 31:16.374
(Mariah crying)
I had so much to do.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.128
And when she was born,

31:20.169 --> 31:23.256
it wasn't that immediate
connection they tell you

31:23.298 --> 31:24.465
it's gonna be.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.970
I was so worried
about my life changing,

31:29.012 --> 31:31.890
about my career.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.475
And she was this...

31:34.517 --> 31:37.353
this strange, little creature.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.940
(crying)

31:40.982 --> 31:43.526
I was in pain.
My head wasn't on straight.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.156
But I got help.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.956
And she and I, we...

31:56.998 --> 31:59.792
We grew into our love.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.669
We fought

32:01.711 --> 32:03.630
to get where we were, you know?

32:03.671 --> 32:06.966
And I was never gonna stop
fighting for her.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.845
But I missed it all.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.890
Her first words.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.434
Her first steps.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.813
Her first everything.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.441
She was this
tiny, little blob

32:23.483 --> 32:27.528
in my arms, and now she
has had a whole life.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.572
And...

32:29.614 --> 32:31.157
she didn't...

32:31.199 --> 32:33.660
she didn't need me.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.290
(sobbing)

32:53.763 --> 32:56.641
CLAUDETTE:
You're gonna get to sleep
in a real bed tonight.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.102
I thought at least that would've
put a smile on your face.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.603
No.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.271
No, I'm in the future,

33:02.313 --> 33:04.107
and you're, like,
one of the X-Men.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.401
I'm a what now?
And I'm stuck in this dump,

33:06.442 --> 33:09.320
I'm totally alone,
and I just want my phone back.

33:10.238 --> 33:13.157
I'll admit I think y'all have
a real surprising attachment

33:13.199 --> 33:14.534
to telephones now.
(chuckles)

33:14.575 --> 33:15.910
Mm.
And

33:15.952 --> 33:17.704
I can't say
what's happening here

33:17.745 --> 33:19.872
other than to take as truth

33:19.914 --> 33:22.000
what I done seen
with my own two eyes.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.043
But I do know one thing.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.421
You're not alone.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.173
You, me, the doc,

33:29.215 --> 33:31.592
everyone in here,
we are all in this together.

33:31.634 --> 33:35.013
And that's the only way we gonna
get through it. You hear me?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.563
Say, you think
that piano's in tune?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.725
ANDRE:
Mrs. Williams is

34:20.767 --> 34:22.643
quite a surprising talent.
Perhaps she'll play it for us.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.188

I didn't touch her.
SHANICE:
Is there some rule

35:13.986 --> 35:15.947
against playing the piano
that nobody knows about?

35:15.988 --> 35:17.115
This isn't summer camp.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.366
We have a schedule.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.034
Come on!
Line up!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.577
Rotating the second
shift into dinner

35:21.619 --> 35:22.829
in five.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.248
The piano is off-limits.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.083
(others protesting quietly)

35:34.132 --> 35:35.716
You okay?

35:35.758 --> 35:38.636
Let me see.
I'll examine her,

35:38.678 --> 35:40.346
but it looked benign to me.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.306
Really? Because it sounded

35:42.348 --> 35:44.183
like it was bad...
Just-just hit my funny bone
is all.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.978
But thank you for your concern.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.791
This seat taken?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.710
I'm not interested.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.296
And I'm definitely
not interested.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.382
Now, I have to turn in
a report tomorrow morning

36:16.424 --> 36:18.301
about what went down today,
and...

36:18.342 --> 36:20.344
Look, is there anything
you want to tell me?

36:20.386 --> 36:22.763
A reason you're so protective
of Shanice Murray?

36:22.805 --> 36:26.517
I was protective
because I have seen what happens

36:26.559 --> 36:28.227
when a powerful
government machine

36:28.269 --> 36:30.771
treats people like
they're problems

36:30.813 --> 36:32.690
instead of human beings.
That's not what's happening.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.358
Okay...
We don't know
what's happening.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.944
All right? We know some people
appeared out of nowhere,

36:36.986 --> 36:39.071
and some of them
are from the past.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.240
Now, tell me, how do you think

36:41.282 --> 36:43.284
our government
is gonna react to that?

36:44.619 --> 36:47.246
Look, you might
be a good person.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.291
All right, the people we report
to might be good people.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.753
But even good people
justify very bad things

36:53.794 --> 36:56.088
in the name of doing their jobs.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.758
In the name
of keeping people safe.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.636
The truth is, I thought...

37:01.677 --> 37:03.179
(scoffs)

37:05.264 --> 37:08.935
My brother Manny is missing,

37:08.976 --> 37:12.688
and I thought that I had seen
a green light out the window

37:12.730 --> 37:14.774
right after he left.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.943
(scoffs)
The first time

37:16.984 --> 37:18.778
in a year

37:18.819 --> 37:20.947
I had real hope.

37:20.988 --> 37:24.867
There's no sign of Manny
among any of these people.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.245
And I am gonna have to face
the fact

37:27.286 --> 37:29.455
that I'll probably
never see him again.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.089
Well, it's been real.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.217
I'll fix it with DHS.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.720
Okay? I've got...

37:44.762 --> 37:46.931
connections.

37:47.890 --> 37:51.060
So that is what is going on
between you and Agent Tanner,

37:51.102 --> 37:53.437
huh? Connections.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.065
(chuckles softly)

37:59.026 --> 38:00.695
I know what it's like

38:00.736 --> 38:02.571
to lose someone
you were supposed to protect.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.033
Okay, my sister was killed

38:06.075 --> 38:08.953
walking home from the library
five years ago.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.955
Gunfire. Not meant for her.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.208
A parolee who shouldn't
have had access to a weapon.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.668
Keisha, I'm sorry. I didn't...

38:15.710 --> 38:17.670
It's hard
to let anyone get close.

38:17.712 --> 38:20.131
Anyone you could ever let down
like that again.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.508
Easier to protect strangers.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.598
(dialogue inaudible)
Uh, hey, can you
turn that up for me?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.267
NEWSMAN:
We are following up

38:31.309 --> 38:33.602
on explosive allegations
about the mysterious gathering

38:33.644 --> 38:35.438
on Belle Isle two nights ago.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.523
A whistleblower tells us
a number of the people

38:37.565 --> 38:39.358
have been identified
as missing persons

38:39.400 --> 38:41.027
who all appeared
at the same location

38:41.068 --> 38:42.486
for reasons unknown.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.530
We are told the total number
of returnees

38:44.572 --> 38:46.324
is 4,400,

38:46.365 --> 38:49.285
and they're being held
at undisclosed locations.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.086
Where'd you disappear
to yesterday?

38:59.128 --> 39:01.047
I got out.
Out?

39:01.088 --> 39:03.507
How?
I don't know.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.134
The door just opened.
(Claudette exhales)

39:05.176 --> 39:07.428
So that's what got
the guards' cages all rattled.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.846
And?

39:08.888 --> 39:10.556
Is it true?

39:10.598 --> 39:14.185
Unless someone's put together
a very elaborate hoax,

39:14.226 --> 39:16.687
it's really 2021.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.732
And they came after me.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.026
Sent the whole cavalry
to bring me back in.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.111
That's a whole lot of effort
for one Black woman.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.031
Yep. So, why us?

39:27.073 --> 39:29.575
Far as I can tell,
we have nothing in common.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.202
Not where we're from.
Not when we're from.

39:31.243 --> 39:34.330
So why now? Why this?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.458
For some reason, we're special.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.212
As much as I wish I didn't have
anything to do with any of this,

39:41.253 --> 39:43.589
I've realized that if we have
that kind of value,

39:43.631 --> 39:45.925
it means one more thing.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.386
Yeah, and what's that?

39:48.427 --> 39:50.429
We're not powerless.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.728
I think I might just like 2021.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.355
(chuckles softly)

40:00.981 --> 40:02.942
KEISHA:
There's news vans outside.

40:02.983 --> 40:05.111
You holding up?
Hounded by the press,

40:05.152 --> 40:06.445
the White House,

40:06.487 --> 40:08.280
people who think
we have their loved ones.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.157
These people,

40:10.199 --> 40:12.660
the ones we can find data on,
follow no clear pattern.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.620
They're just standard
missing persons cases.

40:14.662 --> 40:18.999
Others match records that defy
every logical explanation.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.710
The Pentagon
is exploring every theory.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.380
They're reading in NASA.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.258
Do they think this is
something extraterrestrial?

40:27.299 --> 40:28.634
I know it sounds crazy,

40:28.676 --> 40:30.302
but the time period
discrepancies?

40:30.344 --> 40:32.513
Some people have reported
seeing green lights?

40:32.555 --> 40:36.267
The way none of this makes sense
or is even possible?

40:38.477 --> 40:39.937
I'm glad you're here.

40:41.689 --> 40:42.857
And...

40:42.898 --> 40:46.694
be careful with them.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.742
(sighs)

40:54.660 --> 40:56.745
What are you doing
out here?

40:58.664 --> 41:01.167
I'm glad they finally found you
something else to wear.

41:01.208 --> 41:04.295
Heard they were gonna hit up
the Salvation Army.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.673
You know,
my sister and I saw her

41:07.715 --> 41:09.508
at Ford Field when we were kids.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.344
She wanted to be
a rapper/mogul/collaborator

41:12.386 --> 41:13.596
just like Missy.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.642
You don't even know who that is,
do you?

41:22.354 --> 41:23.981
Come on.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.816
Let's get you in a room
so you can get some sleep.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.445
Tell Jharrel
that Manny's all right.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.825
And that he's sorry
for everything.
