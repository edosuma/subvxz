{\an8}EVER.

06:40.024 --> 06:43.402
{\an8}NO, I DON'T.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.408
{\an8}- AFTER SNOOKI CAME HOME,
I TOLD HER THAT NIGHT,

06:49.492 --> 06:50.743
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"I LOVE YOU."

06:50.827 --> 06:51.994
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"WE'RE ALL LIKE FAMILY."

06:52.078 --> 06:53.830

{\an8}AND THEY REALIZE
I'M A NICE PERSON

07:13.516 --> 07:15.518
{\an8}AND I CARE ABOUT
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.187
{\an8}SO NOW THEY ALL FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.907
{\an8}I CAN'T DRINK,
I CAN'T EVEN BRUSH MY TEETH.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.618
{\an8}- YEAH, I GOT,

10:28.461 --> 10:30.546
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT?

10:30.629 --> 10:31.881

10:31.964 --> 10:33.966
{\an8}WE WERE AT THE BAR,
AND A GROWN MAN

10:34.050 --> 10:35.426
{\an8}DECIDED TO PUNCH HER
IN THE FACE.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.261
{\an8}- REALLY?
- OH, HELL NO.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.220
{\an8}- AND YOU GUYS DIDN'T, LIKE,
GO AND BASH HIM?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.639
{\an8}- WE COULDN'T.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
{\an8}- IT HAPPENED, LIKE--

10:42.433 --> 10:43.726
{\an8}- THIS KID IS, LIKE,
SO LUCKY THE COPS WERE THERE.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.187
{\an8}BECAUSE I WAS ABOUT
TO BARREL THROUGH COPS.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.021
{\an8}I WAS THAT,
I WAS THAT HEATED.

10:47.104 --> 10:47.980
{\an8}- LET'S GO BACK TO THAT BAR.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.358
{\an8}[laughter]

10:52.151 --> 10:53.361
{\an8}- SAM, TELL HER--

10:54.945 --> 10:56.614
{\an8}- HEY, MA, CUT THE [bleep].

11:29.355 --> 11:30.439
{\an8}TO MEET RONNIE'S PARENTS.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.274
{\an8}THEY'RE EITHER GONNA LOVE ME
OR HATE ME.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.651
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT

11:33.734 --> 11:35.277
{\an8}AND I'M NOT GONNA

{\an8}IS GONNA BE
AN UNBELIEVABLE DINNER

18:51.296 --> 18:53.590
{\an8}AND TAKES A LOT OF TIME
AND PREPARATION TO PUT TOGETHER.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.176
{\an8}AND THE GIRLS, YOU KNOW,

18:56.260 --> 18:58.262
{\an8}DON'T HAVE REALLY
ANY PART OF IT.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.721

19:20.075 --> 19:21.326
{\an8}- UM, WE'RE ALL HERE
FOR EACH OTHER.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.078
{\an8}IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT WORSE.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.413
{\an8}I THINK WHAT HAPPENED
TO SNICKERS

19:24.496 --> 19:26.331
{\an8}HAS BROUGHT US A LOT CLOSER
TO SNICKERS, DEFINITELY.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.708
{\an8}'CAUSE NOW WE, LIKE,
KIND OF FEEL BAD

19:27.791 --> 19:29.918
{\an8}AND SHE'S A REAL PERSON.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.086
{\an8}I MEAN, WE GET ON HER
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

19:31.169 --> 19:33.255
{\an8}BUT WE STILL CARE FOR HER.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.720
{\an8}- I TRIED TO EAT,
BUT I COULDN'T GET IT

19:39.803 --> 19:41.471
{\an8}IN MY FRICKIN' MOUTH
BECAUSE I'M DISABLED.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.140
{\an8}SO I WAS LIKE--

19:43.223 --> 19:47.519
{\an8}[chuckles]

19:47.603 --> 19:49.605
{\an8}- SNICKERS IS HAVING TROUBLE
EATING ALL FOOD.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.066
{\an8}IT'S SO SAD AND, LIKE,
SHE JUST DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.578
{\an8}- WHO CAN'T CLEAN UP
THEIR PLATE HERE?

20:04.661 --> 20:05.787
{\an8}- GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.247
{\an8}I JUST COOKED [bleep]
FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.332
{\an8}- GOOD JOB, YOU COOKED FOOD
FOR EVERYBODY.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.001
{\an8}HAVE I EVER ASKED YOU
TO COOK ME FOOD? NO.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.294
{\an8}DO YOU DO IT? YEAH.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.921
{\an8}CAN YOU CLEAN UP AFTER
YOURSELF?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.005
{\an8}YEAH, YOU CAN CLEAN YOUR PLATE
OFF THE TABLE.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.924
{\an8}- EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE
EACH SIDE OF MY PLATE

20:17.007 --> 20:19.217
{\an8}AND WALK IT TO THE GARBAGE.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.802
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M NOT TOUCHING IT.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.429
{\an8}- I'M NOT CLEANING IT UP.
I'M NOT CLEANING IT UP.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.847
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY
I'M CLEANING THAT UP.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.307
{\an8}- JUST 'CAUSE YOU COOKED
DOESN'T MEAN [bleep].

20:25.390 --> 20:28.977
{\an8}- I'M NOT TOUCHING ONE DISH
BECAUSE I COOKED A CRAZY MEAL

20:29.061 --> 20:32.731
{\an8}AND SHE'S GOT THE NERVE
TO TELL ME TO CLEAN MY PLATE.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.649
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.359
{\an8}YOU ARE EXCLUDED

{\an8}- MIKE WAS JUST BEING
A STUBBORN LITTLE BITCH,

20:44.910 --> 20:46.954
{\an8}TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.163
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
I WASN'T GONNA LET HIM,

20:48.246 --> 20:50.207
{\an8}LIKE, DISRESPECT SAMMI,
SO I [bleep] PICKED UP THE PLATE

20:50.290 --> 20:51.375
{\an8}AND I CLEANED IT FOR HIM.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.918
{\an8}- OH, [bleep] RON-RON

{\an8}- ISN'T THAT EMBARRASSING
TO YOU?

20:56.630 --> 20:57.839
{\an8}- NO, IT'S NOT EMBARRASSING
TO ME.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.007
{\an8}- I KIND OF FEEL LIKE

20:59.091 --> 21:01.885
{\an8}MIKE THINKS HE'S IN CONTROL
IN THE HOUSE.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.011
{\an8}HE'S THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.137
{\an8}- IS IT EMBARRASSING

21:04.221 --> 21:05.263
{\an8}THAT I PUT TOGETHER
A FEAST TONIGHT?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.849
{\an8}- YEAH, AND EVERYBODY DID TOO.
NOT JUST YOU.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.017
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.394

{\an8}WHILE YOU WERE GETTING YOUR NAIL
AND YOUR HAIR DID TODAY.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.943
{\an8}- I DIDN'T GET NO NAILS DONE
OR MY HAIR DID.

21:18.026 --> 21:18.860
{\an8}THAT'S A BUNCH
OF BULL[bleep].

21:18.944 --> 21:21.029
{\an8}MIKE, CLEAN
THE [bleep] DISHES.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.157
{\an8}- I LOOK OVER,
AND I SEE, LIKE,

21:24.241 --> 21:25.575
{\an8}HAIR BEING PULLED
AND ALL THIS [bleep].

21:25.659 --> 21:26.243
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
LIKE, HOW DO I GET IN?"

21:26.326 --> 21:29.538
{\an8}[overlapping yelling]

21:29.621 --> 21:31.915
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T CALL
JWOWW FAT 'CAUSE YOU'LL GET HIT.

{\an8}- I TOOK THE BOSS' GIRL.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.170
{\an8}OH, MY GOD!

21:48.390 --> 21:49.182
{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW SNICKERS
GOT HIT.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.643
{\an8}I THOUGHT IT WAS
ONE OF THE GUYS.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.270
{\an8}- I HEARD IT.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.312
{\an8}I [bleep] FELT IT
WHEN HE HIT HER.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.400
{\an8}I THOUGHT HER [bleep] TEETH
WERE GONE.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.776
{\an8}- MIKE INSTIGATED
THE WHOLE THING,

21:59.860 --> 22:01.361
{\an8}'CAUSE MIKE
WAS BUYING THEM SHOTS.

22:01.445 --> 22:01.987
{\an8}MIKE WAS BUYING THEM DRINKS.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.031
{\an8}- NEVER AGAIN, DUDE.

22:04.114 --> 22:04.906
{\an8}MIKE ONLY DOES CARE ABOUT
HIMSELF.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.992
{\an8}HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT NICOLE.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.078
{\an8}LIKE, THIS KID JUST POINT BLANK
IN THE FACE HIT HER,

22:10.162 --> 22:12.748
{\an8}AND MIKE STOOD BACK
AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.041
{\an8}I'M HAPPY YOU LIKE SNICKERS NOW.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.292
{\an8}- SNICKERS IS COOL.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.502
{\an8}I WAS THE ONE WHO TALKED TO HER
THAT NIGHT.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.087
{\an8}I WENT IN THERE AND I HAD
A HEART-TO-HEART WITH HER.

22:19.171 --> 22:19.921
{\an8}AND YESTERDAY,
SHE WAS LIKE, "RONNIE,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.131
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING."

22:21.214 --> 22:22.966
{\an8}YOU KNOW? LIKE--
I FEEL--LIKE, I TOLD--

22:23.050 --> 22:24.217
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"CAUSE I GET ON YOU--"

22:24.301 --> 22:25.427
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT PISSED ME OFF?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.512
{\an8}WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT,
MIKE DECIDED TO COME IN.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.931
{\an8}- YEAH, AND LIKE--

22:30.015 --> 22:31.016
{\an8}- YOU KNOW?

22:31.099 --> 22:31.892
{\an8}LIKE, YOU NEVER SAID
TWO WORDS TO HER, MIKE.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.102
{\an8}LIKE, WHAT THE [bleep]?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.270
{\an8}- MIKE, I DON'T [bleep]
LIKE YOU.
