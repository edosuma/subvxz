00:19.193 --> 00:25.070
Hello, hello, everybody.
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:25.153 --> 00:26.993
Thanks very much.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.020
We're back!

00:34.425 --> 00:36.685
We're back! We are back
with a new-look Top Gear.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.610
We have changed everything.

00:39.230 --> 00:43.148
And to give you a taste of what you-
can expect over the coming weeks,

00:43.149 --> 00:45.949
And to give you a taste of what you-
we have prepared a little montage.

00:55.590 --> 00:56.990
Tally-ho, tally-ho, chaps.

01:00.430 --> 01:01.390
They are all over me!

01:03.630 --> 01:05.310
At Twickenham, for England!

01:09.910 --> 01:11.990
We might actually just
be in with a chance.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.150
Let's do this for
Carroll Shelby, come on!

01:18.230 --> 01:20.630
You will find
the source of the River Nile.

01:28.270 --> 01:31.630
Here we are, ladies, at
the bowling club. Oh, lovely.

01:34.270 --> 01:37.070
And, stop. Oh, I am so on board.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.350
There is nobody driving!

01:42.990 --> 01:45.070
The last arrival cross into
Mexico...

01:52.510 --> 01:56.710
I have accidentally
painted a gentleman's
sausage on a storm drain.

01:59.030 --> 01:59.870
'Oh, my.'

02:07.150 --> 02:08.110
Big jump, whoa!

02:23.910 --> 02:26.430
We haven't changed anything,
have we? No. Not really.

02:27.070 --> 02:30.150
Wait, I have bought a new jacket.
You have new shoes.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.350
I am in my 50s now. James, to be
fair, you were born in your 50s.

02:34.990 --> 02:39.630
To be honest,
James turned 50 just last week.

02:44.270 --> 02:45.550
Why are you applauding?

02:47.030 --> 02:49.030
All he had to do to get to 50
was not die,

02:49.070 --> 02:51.470
and the speed he drives,
that is not difficult.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.470
Anyway, we have a tremendous series
coming up, some amazing races,

02:56.150 --> 02:58.950
some incredible challenges
and, of course, some brilliant cars.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.710
And we start with
the best of them all.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.390
The Pagani Zonda is
my favourite supercar.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.010
But it has been around
for a decade now,

03:14.190 --> 03:17.270
and for the last few years
Pagani have been promising again

03:18.230 --> 03:21.870
and again that they will replace it
with a brand-new car.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.070
And now, finally, they have.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.750
It is called the Huayra.

03:48.070 --> 03:54.670
It costs Ј800,000 and it has
a top speed of 230 miles per hour.

04:01.390 --> 04:05.030
The name Huayra comes from
the South American god of wind.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.510
Probably not what you want to hear.

04:10.430 --> 04:13.950
What you do want to hear is that
it has six litre twin turbo V12,

04:14.870 --> 04:18.110
made especially for it by AMG.

04:18.910 --> 04:24.390
And once petrol is applied,
it makes 733 brake horsepower.

04:25.190 --> 04:29.670
And what you do want to hear and see-
is what that does.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.030
Aaaargh, ha-ha!

04:40.710 --> 04:42.510
It spins its wheels all the time!

04:48.670 --> 04:49.790
I'm in a monster!

04:51.310 --> 04:53.950
Ha-ha-ha!

04:55.070 --> 05:00.950
Oh, dear God! 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds-
and then on into space!

05:04.430 --> 05:06.110
That is 180.

05:09.430 --> 05:14.630
That is savage. Savage, savage thing.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.830
I can't get enough of that.
I'm going to do that again.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.550
The drama isn't just
restricted to the speed.

05:25.470 --> 05:30.790
Because inside the Huayra,
it looks like a Victorian's idea
of the 23rd century.

05:33.590 --> 05:37.230
And the detail is beyond obsessive,
every single nut and bolt

05:40.270 --> 05:43.070
is made from titanium.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.508
The name badge takes 24 hours
to carve out from

05:46.509 --> 05:48.650
The name badge takes 24 hours
a solid piece of aluminium.

05:48.710 --> 05:51.948
Each wheel, also hewn from
a single aluminium block,

05:51.949 --> 05:53.990
Each wheel, also hewn from
takes five days to make.

05:59.350 --> 06:00.590
And look at this gear shifter,

06:01.390 --> 06:03.910
all the mechanism is exposed so
you can see the workings. It is

06:04.710 --> 06:06.790
made from 67 different parts,
all arranged just

06:07.630 --> 06:10.830
so you can hear that mechanical
clunk of a gear being selected.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.590
You don't even need to use it,
you can use the paddles by the wheel

06:14.270 --> 06:17.070
but they have put that there because-
it makes it more of an occasion.

06:22.510 --> 06:27.270
This fanatical attention to detail
goes on and on and on.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.870
Even the body is more high-tech
than the one you will

06:31.630 --> 06:33.750
find on a Formula One car.

06:37.070 --> 06:40.270
It is made from carbotanium.
I even know what that means!

06:40.950 --> 06:42.350
Now someone has told me.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.950
It is a blend of carbon fibre
and titanium,

06:46.310 --> 06:49.830
which is incredibly light but is
actually stiffer than carbon fibre

06:50.630 --> 06:52.590
and does not shatter
when you crash.

06:54.190 --> 06:57.030
That makes things safer
should you suddenly find
all 730 brake horsepower

06:57.670 --> 06:59.910
propelling you towards a hedge.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.070
Not every element, though,
is quite so cutting edge.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.230
Pagani haven't gone with
a fashionable twin plate clutch
that so many cars use,

07:09.870 --> 07:11.990
because they do make for
faster changes.

07:12.790 --> 07:16.190
They have gone instead for
a more traditional single plate
clutch because it is smaller

07:16.390 --> 07:18.190
and a whole 100 kilograms lighter.

07:21.790 --> 07:25.710
In fact, the Huayra
weighs just 1,350 kilograms

07:27.070 --> 07:32.230
and has the power-to-weight ratio
of 541 brake horsepower per ton.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.710
That is more than you get
from a Bugatti Veyron.

07:37.630 --> 07:41.110
But where the Bugatti Veyron
is four-wheel drive,
this is only rear-wheel drive

07:42.190 --> 07:44.951
and, rather worryingly, we have now
come to the part of the film where

07:45.790 --> 07:47.870
we must see what it is like
going round corners.

07:51.310 --> 07:53.870
I understand the more infantile
viewers, of which there are many,

07:54.950 --> 07:57.430
will now want to see me
sliding the back end around.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.750
So, here goes.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.830
Amazingly, you can corner this car
like a halfwit

08:22.870 --> 08:25.510
and come out the other side alive.

08:26.470 --> 08:31.510
And that is because in the Huayra
the black art of aerodynamics is
watching over you.

08:32.190 --> 08:33.710
You see those flaps on the outside?

08:34.510 --> 08:37.350
There are two at the back and two
the front. They measure how fast

08:37.590 --> 08:40.230
you're going and then deploy
to keep everything stable.

08:47.790 --> 08:48.750
That is astonishing!

08:54.030 --> 08:55.590
All from the back wheels,
I am in love!

08:56.630 --> 08:59.430
But the handling is not
all down to the magic flaps.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.990
It doesn't feel big,
like a Lambo,

09:03.950 --> 09:05.870
and it has all been set
up so well and

09:06.710 --> 09:11.470
made so stable that even I can
corner it without hiding in the
glovebox, whimpering.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.830
Oh, God,
this is properly put together.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.070
The Zonda was always going to be
a difficult act to follow,

09:25.630 --> 09:27.710
but the Huayra has pulled it off.

09:28.510 --> 09:34.390
It drives better, it looks better,
and it hasn't lost any of the drama.

09:35.190 --> 09:38.150
On top of that, it also has
something
that its main rivals,

09:38.950 --> 09:42.310
Ferrari and Lamborghini,
no longer possess.

09:46.910 --> 09:49.990
This car, and this may get
a bit Culture Show now, I know,

09:50.630 --> 09:52.030
has still got its innocence.

09:55.230 --> 09:56.870
Ferrari and Lamborghini haven't.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.670
One is owned by Audi,

09:59.310 --> 10:02.550
the other is a commercial machine
for selling hats and keyrings.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.190
Pagani is where those companies were-
30 years ago, no corporate culture,

10:08.790 --> 10:12.830
no branded teddy bears,
they just want to make
a bedroom wall pin-up poster.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.390
With a touch of the madness
we saw in the Lamborghinis
of a few decades ago.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.430
And you can feel that!

10:27.950 --> 10:32.590
There might be some people watching
right now who could actually

10:33.230 --> 10:35.470
afford one of these things.

10:36.390 --> 10:38.870
And it is the job of you, me
and everybody else to stand around

10:39.310 --> 10:43.630
and join together in a chorus,
"Do it, do it, do it!"

11:03.230 --> 11:08.550
Wow. That is an amazing looking
thing. Crazy but wonderful. Amazing.

11:09.350 --> 11:12.150
Now, do you know, do you know
which of the world's cities

11:12.950 --> 11:16.470
has placed the largest number of
orders for this car? No.

11:17.270 --> 11:19.230
Wakefield. Does it?
No, I made that up.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.710
Is it really as fast as it looks?

11:23.190 --> 11:25.031
Yes, yes! You know
the straight between Chicago

11:25.510 --> 11:28.470
and Hammerhead? In this,
it is not as long as you think.

11:29.110 --> 11:31.430
It is just there. Is it not?
So I can't relax. "Oh, there!"

11:31.870 --> 11:33.950
It is just one corner,
it is amazingly insanely fast.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.590
Now, obviously, we must find out
how fast it goes around our track

11:38.390 --> 11:41.071
and that of course means handing it-
over to our tame racing driver.

11:41.990 --> 11:44.070
Some say that we have at least
thought of a new way

11:44.750 --> 11:47.390
of introducing him. But we haven't.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.430
It's The Stig!

11:53.030 --> 11:54.750
And he is off,
surprisingly gentle at first,

11:55.110 --> 11:57.510
but then the tyres light up,
the spoilers spring into action.

11:58.830 --> 12:02.350
Coming up to the first corner
and he is, he is indicating,

12:03.270 --> 12:05.790
seems unnecessary,
but he is keeping it all in shape.

12:06.910 --> 12:09.150
Just about.

12:14.510 --> 12:18.070
Should explain that since
the Olympics, The Stig has become
obsessed with national anthems.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.750
He is around Chicago
and fires in towards Hammerhead,

12:22.670 --> 12:25.350
Hammond was right,
that took no time at all.

12:26.150 --> 12:29.350
Under-braking and takes it easy
through the left and right.

12:30.430 --> 12:37.150
Now, hard on the power. Do you hear-
those turbo waste-gates fluttering?

12:39.510 --> 12:42.710
Now, follow through, surely he
can't
use all the power there.

12:43.510 --> 12:46.470
He did. He double breaks
as he passes the tyres,

12:47.790 --> 12:49.710
presumably with his left foot,
or the middle one.

12:50.150 --> 12:52.510
Just two corners left.
God he is coming in fast.

12:53.310 --> 12:57.670
Steady, Stig, up to Gambon.
He's very smooth through there.

12:58.470 --> 12:59.710
And across the line.

13:03.830 --> 13:07.030
Right, the Pagani, Pagani...

13:07.870 --> 13:11.790
Hu... in. Huayra.

13:13.110 --> 13:18.150
Huuuugh. It is a stupid name.
Why is it stupid?

13:18.710 --> 13:20.230
It hasn't got any constants in it.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.390
Consonants are the meat of language,
if you had no constants in your
name

13:23.950 --> 13:26.030
you would be... I-a.

13:26.990 --> 13:30.350
And I'd be... Eey.

13:32.790 --> 13:36.030
People have waited a long time for
us
to come back and that is it.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.590
Anyway, the fastest car
we have ever had around the track
is

13:40.310 --> 13:42.670
the Arial Atom V8 1.15.1.

13:43.630 --> 13:46.150
Now, are you seriously suggesting
that this is faster than that?

13:48.350 --> 13:50.551
I would say it is in with a shout
of being as fast, yes.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.470
Well, you're wrong. Oh.

13:53.270 --> 13:56.070
Because, the Pagani did it in 1...

13:56.750 --> 13:59.950
13.8. I am not joking.

14:03.270 --> 14:06.070
It is genuinely staggering.

14:10.070 --> 14:12.310
I can't see that time being beaten
ever, to be honest.

14:14.230 --> 14:19.990
Anyway, it is time to do
the news, and it is good news

14:20.910 --> 14:25.550
because the Dacia Sandero is on
sale in the UK and taking the
nation by storm.

14:27.190 --> 14:30.550
Great! Now, the Mercedes SLS,
there it is.

14:31.790 --> 14:35.110
There is a new black version of it,-
there is a picture of it there
and it is yellow.

14:35.550 --> 14:40.590
It has 60 more horsepower than the
standard, more speed, more violence.

14:41.390 --> 14:43.910
Dear God, is the brochure
written in bullet holes?

14:45.390 --> 14:48.190
No, the brochure is carved into
your
face with a hunting knife. Is it?

14:49.150 --> 14:50.230
Subtle.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.991
I wonder if they have addressed
the problem with the old one,
you could never get it sideways.

14:55.070 --> 14:56.631
This one does not go in
a straight line.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.990
It is funny, weirdly, my friend
just
bought a black series Mercedes

15:00.430 --> 15:02.430
and every time I see him,
I say, "How is it going?"

15:02.910 --> 15:04.870
And he pretends it is great.
"It is fine!

15:05.910 --> 15:08.310
"I am enjoying it!" "But you have
aged 30 years in one week."

15:08.550 --> 15:10.070
"I know! but I really like it!"

15:10.990 --> 15:13.350
That's like saying, "I have
a new attack dog and it's great!

15:14.470 --> 15:18.110
"You don't know when it's going
to attack, or who! I love it."

15:18.910 --> 15:21.870
That is what that is. It's a big
yellow attack dog. It is very silly.

15:23.350 --> 15:24.911
Now, may I talk about
50 Shades Of Grey?

15:25.150 --> 15:26.550
Really?

15:28.310 --> 15:30.670
Can I just honestly ask,
who here has read it? Be honest,

15:31.630 --> 15:33.430
Who here has read it?
We're noticing a trend.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.191
It is mainly a women thing,
I'm guessing, yes?

15:36.870 --> 15:38.830
Men don't really have an equivalent,
until now.

15:39.630 --> 15:42.270
I have found the male equivalent
of 50 Shades Of Grey.

15:43.630 --> 15:44.470
Tremendous Tractors.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.390
Come on, you're going to
love it the most!

15:56.870 --> 15:58.270
Why would you not read that?

15:59.070 --> 16:00.510
It is all in here, isn't it? Spikes!

16:01.390 --> 16:04.270
"These move through the ground
to cover the seeds
after they have dropped.

16:05.150 --> 16:09.350
"This has chunky treads,
to grip bumpy or sloppy ground."

16:11.950 --> 16:14.190
Hammond... This is
absolutely marvellous.

16:15.390 --> 16:18.750
I think you're reading more into it-
than is actually there.

16:19.710 --> 16:23.230
"It cuts the stocks and threshes
them
up to knock the grain right out."

16:26.390 --> 16:28.830
I'm coming over all flushed.
It is just a book about tractors.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.950
And the best thing is,
there is a series of them,

16:31.510 --> 16:35.710
there is Dazzling Diggers, Amazing
Aeroplanes, Enormous Erections.

16:36.510 --> 16:39.870
What? I made that last one up.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.910
"Spreads the straw behind it as
the grain spills from the spout...

16:48.630 --> 16:51.270
"For farmland can be rough!"

16:53.070 --> 16:54.590
I've gone somewhere else.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.191
You have gone cross-eyed,
is what you've gone.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.350
Right, Volkswagen, Volkswagen
named the Touareg, the big 4x4,

17:02.190 --> 17:05.270
after the North African tribesmen.

17:07.470 --> 17:09.589
It must have seemed like
a very good name at the time,

17:09.950 --> 17:11.869
because the other tough,
romantic nomadic people,

17:12.869 --> 17:14.950
eking a simple living
from the harsh desert.

17:16.030 --> 17:18.829
Unfortunately, it turns out that
today the Touareg are running guns

17:19.630 --> 17:24.390
from Libya into Mali and fighting
there alongside hardline Islamists.

17:25.750 --> 17:29.550
I think we can be pretty sure
there will be some high-level very
urgent meetings at VW this week.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.110
They are certainly dropping plans
now for the new hatchback,

17:34.230 --> 17:35.750
the Baader-Meinhof.

17:37.950 --> 17:40.470
"This van, the new
VW Lord's Resistance Army..."

17:41.990 --> 17:46.750
That's the one with the independent-
rear access, or IRA. Stop it! Yes.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.070
If you think about it,
you only need one letter to

17:50.870 --> 17:54.230
drop off the back of your Polo
and you will have VW PLO.

17:55.710 --> 18:00.230
It turns out every single
Volkswagen
is named after
a terrorist organisation!

18:02.830 --> 18:05.230
Right, there is a new Corvette out

18:06.830 --> 18:07.670
and they have brought back
the Stingray name.

18:08.470 --> 18:11.150
All-new chassis so it has perfect
weight distribution, 450 brake
horsepower from a 6.2 litre V8,

18:11.790 --> 18:14.470
which means 0 to 60
will be under four seconds.

18:15.270 --> 18:19.590
And the best thing is it makes you
27% more attractive
to your sister.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.990
No, you know those dot-matrix
on motorways?

18:26.070 --> 18:28.630
Overhead gantries that are used to
warn you about impending doom?

18:28.710 --> 18:31.590
Well, sometimes there is
no impending doom,
so they put up other messages.

18:32.310 --> 18:34.110
I was driving along other day
and one said,

18:35.630 --> 18:37.710
"Have you prepared your car
for winter?"

18:38.790 --> 18:40.591
And I thought,
"When I bought it from Mercedes

18:40.870 --> 18:42.510
"I rather hoped they'd done
that already."

18:43.230 --> 18:45.310
How do you prepare your car
for winter?

18:46.950 --> 18:48.190
We genuinely don't know,

18:48.830 --> 18:51.430
does anyone have any ideas how you
would prepare a car for winter?

18:51.750 --> 18:52.590
Winter tyres!

18:53.510 --> 18:56.030
Winter tyres, you could conceivably-
put winter tyres on

18:56.990 --> 19:00.470
but you only need them for, what,
half a day? And they cost
about Ј150 each.

19:01.830 --> 19:05.190
In the olden, olden, olden days,
you probably did have to
prepare your car for winter.

19:06.830 --> 19:10.750
Perhaps that is the problem, the
man
writing the sign in 1953. Yes.

19:14.510 --> 19:17.430
Is it you? Have you been
moonlighting writing signs?

19:18.390 --> 19:20.910
"Don't forget to line your engine
block with some stout canvas."

19:20.990 --> 19:23.110
It was you!
Can I direct you to your jacket?

19:26.430 --> 19:29.510
Before you say I am locked in 1953,-
Mr Toad.

19:39.350 --> 19:41.030
I am the only modern one here.
Really?

19:41.990 --> 19:43.591
You may remember
a while back on Top Gear

19:44.190 --> 19:45.710
we met the Racer Recovery Team,
a group of injured soldiers

19:46.390 --> 19:48.750
who were planning to take on
the toughest race in the world.

19:50.150 --> 19:51.950
I remember thinking,
that is very noble,

19:54.310 --> 19:57.031
but it is impossible because Mark
Thatcher had for functioning limbs,

19:57.790 --> 20:00.750
he never made it,
so the idea that they would was,
in my mind, preposterous.

20:01.230 --> 20:03.431
The race was over 1,500 kilometres
across South America,

20:03.990 --> 20:08.070
it took two weeks, 305 of
the entrants didn't finish.

20:09.150 --> 20:14.310
But, and this is amazing news,
last Sunday, they did!

20:20.990 --> 20:24.630
Philip Gillespie, Matt O'Hare
and the rest of the team,

20:25.550 --> 20:28.790
deep, deep respect from all of us
here, that is amazing.

20:30.710 --> 20:33.070
Tremendous. Right,
that is the end of the news.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.030
I would like to move things on
swiftly to the Bentley Continental.

20:37.350 --> 20:41.150
There are various versions
available, you can have one with a
top speed of 187, top speed of 194,

20:41.510 --> 20:43.350
a top speed of 198,

20:44.670 --> 20:49.310
but what if none of these top
speeds
are quite what you're after?

20:50.510 --> 20:53.150
Well, Bentley has a solution.

21:09.990 --> 21:14.190
And here it is.
The Continental GT speed.

21:15.510 --> 21:18.390
This is not to be confused
with the previous
Bentley Continental GT speed,

21:18.710 --> 21:21.670
or the Bentley Continental GT
super sport or in fact any other

21:22.350 --> 21:25.150
Bentley Continental that looks
exactly the same as this one.

21:26.790 --> 21:28.590
No, this one is a bit special.

21:31.910 --> 21:35.390
What this is is
the fastest Bentley ever built

21:37.150 --> 21:39.830
because it will be
205 miles per hour.

21:40.750 --> 21:45.510
It will also go from 0 to 60
in just four seconds.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.550
And to deliver that kind of
performance,

21:49.350 --> 21:53.550
the standard issue six litre
twin turbo engine has been stoked

21:54.230 --> 21:57.150
to produce 616 horsepower.

21:58.630 --> 22:01.870
To ensure that all that power is
delivered in an orderly fashion,

22:02.790 --> 22:06.150
this car has been fitted with a new-
eight-speed automatic gear box.

22:18.030 --> 22:22.590
To help it stand out next to a regular Continental GT,
the speed has been given a few signature flourishes.

22:26.190 --> 22:29.670
Such as
this black mesh radiator grille,

22:31.350 --> 22:32.590
these rifled exhausts,

22:33.390 --> 22:37.470
and inside, a gorgeous
dark tinted aluminium fascia.

22:40.790 --> 22:43.830
It costs just over £150,000, and at-
this point you may be thinking,

22:46.630 --> 22:50.597
"So what? Why do we need
another fast Bentley anyway?"

22:55.323 --> 22:58.243
I thought exactly the same,
until I drove it.

23:00.883 --> 23:03.803
Up until now, every Continental GT
has been, to my mind,

23:04.763 --> 23:07.443
just a sort of big posh car
built to the numbers.

23:08.123 --> 23:10.043
Built to an easy directive.

23:11.843 --> 23:15.603
But this car, finally feels,
I think, like a Bentley should.

23:16.683 --> 23:20.203
It is not the magnitude of the
power
that is important, it is

23:21.003 --> 23:22.523
the way it is turned into speed.

23:23.483 --> 23:26.283
You sort of get a discreet
"ahem" from the Butler,

23:27.363 --> 23:31.403
and then this big aristocratic
whomp in the kidneys.

23:33.443 --> 23:37.523
The ride in a Bentley,
I think, should be reasonably firm

23:39.283 --> 23:41.523
but forgiving and supple,
and that is what you get here.

23:42.203 --> 23:43.443
You feel very much in control.

23:44.243 --> 23:47.043
You can read the road
through the wheels
and through the steering wheel,

23:47.403 --> 23:49.643
but it does not batter you
in any way.

23:51.003 --> 23:53.403
Likewise, that new eight-speed
gear box is an absolute peach.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.883
It is also intelligent,
it will skip gears,

23:59.563 --> 24:01.963
it will go from fourth to eighth
if that is what is required.

24:04.003 --> 24:06.083
The Continental has
been around for ten years now,

24:07.163 --> 24:09.523
and what this version feels like
is a decade of engineering

24:10.323 --> 24:13.563
coming together to make
something rather special.

24:14.483 --> 24:16.163
So to find out
how good it really is,

24:16.963 --> 24:20.763
we decided to take it somewhere
more
demanding than a Welsh B road.

24:21.563 --> 24:25.323
So, since it
has four-wheel-drive...

24:30.403 --> 24:35.843
Yes, we're going to unleash her
£150,000 Bentley on a full-blown

24:36.483 --> 24:39.563
stage of
the World Rally Championship.

24:42.483 --> 24:46.243
Specifically, here, on a 15-mile
stage of the gruelling Welsh Rally.

24:51.683 --> 24:55.043
This is Top Gear
consumer journalism.

24:58.203 --> 25:00.563
I have never driven a rally stage,
and I'm not going to now.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.403
I am giving the job to rally ace
Kris Meeke.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.043
Who you may remember from our race
between a rally car

25:10.843 --> 25:14.483
and Olympic gold-medal skele-bob
pilot in Amy Williams.

25:17.123 --> 25:21.163
On that occasion my job was to sit
next to him and not look scared.

25:24.483 --> 25:26.683
Today, though, I would have to give-
Kris directions.

25:28.083 --> 25:31.163
That meant getting to grips with
the mystifying world of pace notes.

25:32.643 --> 25:35.043
Basically, the number before the R,-
the R is a right,

25:36.403 --> 25:39.483
the number is the severity of
the bend. One is a slight bend

25:40.683 --> 25:43.723
and the six is a real hard bend,
so the numbers are graded
one through to six.

25:44.283 --> 25:46.243
The numbers between the corners
are the distance,

25:47.203 --> 25:50.403
so 40 is 40 metres, the C that you
were calling is a crest

25:51.363 --> 25:54.843
and the arrow is into, so that'll
be
crest into one right over crest.

25:56.203 --> 25:59.163
So how do I do this and look out
the window at the same time?

26:00.243 --> 26:03.004
You don't look out, you have to
feel
the corners through your backside.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.203
So your brain needs to be
200-300 metres ahead of my driving.

26:10.243 --> 26:13.603
If it goes wrong, and we have
a crash, who says sorry first?

26:14.963 --> 26:17.763
First thing I will do
is check your pulse
to see if you're still living,

26:18.283 --> 26:19.803
then I will ask you to apologise.

26:23.403 --> 26:25.963
Besides the complexity of the pace
notes there was another worry.

26:26.563 --> 26:28.683
A world Rally car is
purpose-built for the job.

26:29.763 --> 26:32.003
It weighs just 1,200 kilograms,

26:33.083 --> 26:36.163
and has bespoke brakes
to help it stop.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.923
Its gearbox is made to soak up
the punishment,

26:39.883 --> 26:43.803
its roll cages designed to keep
the occupants in one piece.

26:46.963 --> 26:52.843
By contrast, all we have changed on-
our 2.3 ton Bentley was the seats.

26:56.203 --> 26:58.283
The seats are good.
I think that is good thinking,

26:59.763 --> 27:03.003
but most of other things about this-
car are bad, aren't they, for
rally?
Too big.

27:04.483 --> 27:06.283
Yeah. A Bentley on a rally
is a stupid idea.

27:08.323 --> 27:10.524
It has all the horsepower you need
to get it up to speed

27:10.843 --> 27:13.843
but we are trying to stop
2.3 tonnes on road tyres
so we don't have the grip.

27:15.123 --> 27:18.483
And you haven't got the handbrake.
You have the electric handbrake,
which is no good.

27:19.803 --> 27:20.323
It is not, but we will have to do
a little bit of man manoeuvring
around the hairpins.

27:21.443 --> 27:23.523
Are you a bit scared about driving
this rally course?

27:25.163 --> 27:27.683
I am a little bit.
You should be even more scared.

27:31.963 --> 27:35.323
And on those final words of comfort-
we took place on the start line.

27:40.203 --> 27:42.283
You see that bloke's
moustache there? Yes.

27:43.243 --> 27:45.483
That tells me everything
is going to be all right.

27:47.247 --> 27:48.927
So if you count me down,
do a five. Yeah.

27:49.727 --> 27:54.367
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:04.447 --> 28:05.847
Four right. 40.

28:09.567 --> 28:12.247
You need to be quicker, James,
come on. 40 metres. Four right.

28:16.247 --> 28:18.167
Suddenly, I knew what it felt like
to be a rabbit

28:21.327 --> 28:22.607
caught in the headlights.

28:23.407 --> 28:26.047
Next, James, come on!
Left, left plus two left.

28:30.927 --> 28:33.367
James, I can't go up the road
if you don't call out the notes!

28:33.967 --> 28:35.087
One right. One right?

28:36.567 --> 28:39.367
Repeat, repeat!
Then three right and then 40 metres.

28:42.407 --> 28:44.927
Five right into six left
into 40 metres into five right.

28:46.567 --> 28:48.527
This is the five, you're too late,
James, come on!

28:50.687 --> 28:53.367
Right, square right.
Sorry, square left.

28:55.847 --> 28:57.647
James, either get it right
or shut up!

29:00.847 --> 29:02.927
The red mist had descended
on Chris.

29:04.007 --> 29:05.847
A fog of doubt had enveloped me,

29:06.607 --> 29:08.247
but it seemed he wasn't going to
back off.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.087
Ooph!

29:17.007 --> 29:18.567
Next one! One right.

29:20.887 --> 29:21.687
Bloody hell!

29:22.607 --> 29:23.607
Four right.

29:25.087 --> 29:28.847
On the plus side, the Bentley's
four-wheel-drive was superb.

29:33.167 --> 29:34.287
The power phenomenal.

29:37.327 --> 29:38.887
And Chris was majestic.

29:44.727 --> 29:46.287
Especially in the tight bends

29:47.487 --> 29:50.287
where the Bentley's electric
parking brake was useless.

29:51.047 --> 29:52.727
Going into large hairpin right.

29:56.047 --> 29:57.847
That's where you needed
the handbrake. Yeah.

30:03.407 --> 30:06.927
Ten miles in and I was giving Chris-
proper backup.

30:07.967 --> 30:09.087
Five right.

30:10.007 --> 30:13.967
Severe six right. OK.
That's a bit better, James.

30:15.847 --> 30:16.807
Through water.

30:19.607 --> 30:23.927
40, four left. Tight.
Nearly finished, James.

30:27.127 --> 30:28.247
Two left. Tight.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.647
Man in road. Two left, over a crest.

30:37.647 --> 30:38.487
Jesus!

30:51.607 --> 30:52.688
So, James May, James May...

30:53.247 --> 30:56.727
The big question is, were you last?

30:57.527 --> 30:58.807
No.

30:59.847 --> 31:03.487
We beat a proper WRC rally car
by two seconds.

31:04.327 --> 31:06.967
So you were second to last?
Yeah. First of the winners.

31:08.727 --> 31:12.408
I have to say, though,
obviously I would like to mock you
for your hopeless co-driving skills,

31:12.927 --> 31:15.007
but watching this
on that rally circuit,

31:16.647 --> 31:18.407
a deeply impressive spectacle,
it really was.

31:19.247 --> 31:20.687
Yeah, it is a deeply impressive car.

31:21.207 --> 31:23.287
It's weird, I've never been
a fan of the Continental,

31:23.807 --> 31:25.567
but I drove the little V8 engine
one
last year

31:25.607 --> 31:26.847
and I thought that was pretty
good as well. Yeah, absolutely.

31:27.807 --> 31:30.247
They have done a great deal
to improve the car over the years.

31:30.687 --> 31:31.527
But the trouble is,

31:33.287 --> 31:36.367
they haven't really done anything
to
improve the people who buy them. No.

31:37.327 --> 31:38.928
I mean,
they do all that engineering work

31:40.647 --> 31:42.607
and then they sell it
to Mario Balotelli. Exactly.

31:43.967 --> 31:45.327
Who? I knew you didn't know.

31:46.967 --> 31:49.688
He's that Manchester City player
with the blond Brazilian
on his head.

31:49.727 --> 31:51.127
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:52.487 --> 31:55.047
Anyway, it is now time to put a
star
in our reasonably priced car.

31:57.087 --> 31:59.927
My guest tonight is best known as a-
ginger man who is intent on
bringing

32:00.567 --> 32:04.887
suffering and misery to countless
millions of innocent souls.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.207
Don't worry,
I'm not talking about Mick Hucknall.

32:08.666 --> 32:11.226
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, from Homeland,

32:11.426 --> 32:13.606
Damian Lewis!

32:17.866 --> 32:22.006
You're here! Thank you. How are
you?
Really great. Have a seat.

32:22.986 --> 32:25.226
Thank you. Have a seat.
Thank you. Thank you.

32:28.866 --> 32:32.266
I want to talk about Homeland, obviously,
I know everybody wants to do that, but...

32:33.226 --> 32:35.626
I keep reading that
you don't know how it ends,

32:36.546 --> 32:38.066
but you must do, really.

32:39.706 --> 32:41.826
Well... I could tell you,
but I'd have to kill you!

32:44.146 --> 32:46.546
I don't know how it ends
because they don't know how it ends.

32:47.746 --> 32:50.986
It sounds a little avoiding
to say that,

32:51.906 --> 32:54.107
but honestly the writers
write incredibly spontaneously.

32:55.786 --> 32:58.146
They're actually sitting down
this week to work out what happens
next season. You're in a wood now.

32:59.106 --> 33:01.307
It's a bit of a surprise
I'm still alive, I think. Yeah.

33:02.546 --> 33:04.626
Now they've got the headache
of me still being alive,

33:04.746 --> 33:06.226
they've got to work out
what to do with me.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.382
Obama is a fan, isn't?

33:07.382 --> 33:09.816
The president of the
America is a huge fan.

33:09.884 --> 33:12.459
And invited my wife and I
to the White House.

33:12.597 --> 33:13.747
You're kidding!

33:24.281 --> 33:28.757
And actually we sat at
the table opposite him.

33:28.757 --> 33:36.960
I am surprised you haven't been on
Match Of The Day. You are a big fan.

33:36.990 --> 33:41.550
I am a Liverpool fan. As you can tell
from my deep Scouse accent!

33:54.008 --> 33:56.608
And last time I played, actually,
I was playing in the centre
midfield

33:56.948 --> 33:59.828
for England against the rest of
the world with Jamie Redknapp.

34:00.715 --> 34:06.415
It was just me and Jamie marshalling
midfield behind Shearer and Sheringham.

34:06.423 --> 34:10.741
And I clattered into Zizou,
Zinedine Zidane,

34:10.777 --> 34:12.618
after about 15 minutes, and I
didn't
realise how angry he was.

34:12.697 --> 34:16.279
Jamie Redknapp kept following me
around the pitch, saying,

34:16.554 --> 34:18.074
"Dam, Dam, calm down!"

34:19.154 --> 34:20.974
And I said, "What do you mean?"

34:21.194 --> 34:23.154
He said,
"They haven't come to see YOU
play!"

34:25.074 --> 34:29.914
And then in the 30th minute, in front
of 75,000 people, what does Zidane do?

34:30.754 --> 34:32.614
He rolled his foot over the ball
a few times,

34:32.793 --> 34:34.793
went to the touchline,
stood there with the ball,

34:34.994 --> 34:37.174
looked up at me
as I came charging in, like this,

34:37.634 --> 34:39.833
going to tackle Zidane,
looked at me and went...

34:40.514 --> 34:42.194
Poked it straight through my legs...

34:43.274 --> 34:44.793
to spontaneous laughter.

34:45.714 --> 34:48.674
I've never been laughed at
by 70,000 people.

34:50.434 --> 34:53.454
It would shrivel up
and there'd be space for things,
that's for damn sure.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.353
But it was an amazing experience.

34:55.554 --> 34:56.914
Cars. Cars.

34:57.754 --> 35:00.834
I gather your first car
was an Alfa Romeo? Yes, it was.

35:01.754 --> 35:04.274
It wasn't a Spider,
it wasn't a sexy Alfa Romeo.

35:05.074 --> 35:09.834
I bought my Alfa Romeo for a grand
on a forecourt in Balham High Road.

35:11.074 --> 35:13.434
No! Yeah. And it wasn't even
at a car dealership.

35:15.234 --> 35:17.594
It was like a junk shop
with four cars in front of it,

35:18.674 --> 35:20.074
just lined up on the pavement.

35:21.714 --> 35:23.494
I used to live in Balham
and I know exact...

35:23.514 --> 35:26.274
You bought an Alfa from that man?
It was just off the pavement.

35:27.794 --> 35:30.435
I was pulling out of the car park
at the Royal Shakespeare Company,

35:30.714 --> 35:32.734
where I'd been working
for a couple of years.

35:32.754 --> 35:36.114
I put my foot to the brake, it went-
straight to the floor. No, no!

35:37.034 --> 35:40.474
I just rolled out straight across the
road, bang into the opposite wall.

35:41.554 --> 35:43.752
Normally the Alfa Romeo prevents
that happening by breaking down

35:43.753 --> 35:45.714
on the way TO
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

35:46.794 --> 35:49.994
So if you'd gone through the woe
and the misery of
a very, very unreliable car,

35:51.354 --> 35:54.594
presumably your next one
was more sensible, more reliable?

35:55.554 --> 35:56.794
It was a TVR. There you go.

35:58.674 --> 36:00.354
Which one? The Chimaera.

36:01.194 --> 36:02.994
TVR stands
for Total Vehicle Reliability.

36:06.274 --> 36:08.754
It's amazing fun, though, the TVR,
when you get it going.

36:09.594 --> 36:11.414
And you throw it around
the country lanes.

36:11.914 --> 36:14.154
I thought you were a bike man
more than cars.

36:14.674 --> 36:16.914
I do, well, I have had motorbikes.

36:17.834 --> 36:20.334
I went and got my test
and then totally fell in love

36:20.754 --> 36:22.834
with the ultimate hairdresser's
chopper bike.

36:24.074 --> 36:28.274
Which was the Yamaha Virago 1,000cc-
high-handlebarred...

36:29.474 --> 36:33.674
An Easy Rider bike! Chopper.
Easy Rider, quite.

36:34.474 --> 36:35.994
Did you never fall off a bike?

36:41.714 --> 36:43.474
That's what would stop me getting
on one, the terrible pain that would
result. No idea.

36:43.514 --> 36:46.715
I had a couple of prangs and then I had a
bad one just outside Pentonville Prison

36:47.194 --> 36:49.294
on the Caledonian Road
when a cabbie pulled out

36:49.394 --> 36:51.474
and I just went straight
into his windscreen.

36:52.154 --> 36:53.554
And I was out cold,

36:54.354 --> 36:59.114
woke up in a sort of cinematic
cliche of a circle of faces

36:59.754 --> 37:05.514
as I came to. And also to feel this-
really hard grip on my wrist.

37:06.194 --> 37:08.274
That's the first thing I remember,
just thinking,

37:09.474 --> 37:12.034
"That doesn't feel good. Someone's
really holding onto me tight."

37:12.394 --> 37:15.035
Turned out the guy who was in the
back of the taxi was a male nurse

37:15.874 --> 37:18.674
from the Royal Free Hospital who'd
taken a taxi because he was kissed.

37:19.474 --> 37:20.874
He then said to me later,

37:22.354 --> 37:25.274
he said, "It was good I managed to
get you into the recovery
position."

37:26.754 --> 37:29.274
I said, "Yeah, but why were you
holding onto my wrists so hard?"

37:29.394 --> 37:31.754
He said, "Because I couldn't tell
if you were actually dying

37:32.674 --> 37:34.955
"or if I was just too kissed,
I couldn't find your pulse!"

37:37.554 --> 37:42.314
So it was just like...
My God, come back! Holding onto me.

37:43.274 --> 37:45.154
Normally these days
when people have accidents,

37:45.194 --> 37:47.194
the first thing they see
is somebody videoing them.

37:47.514 --> 37:50.874
That is today's version, isn't it?
It is today's version. Ten iPhones.-
Yeah, exactly.

37:51.514 --> 37:56.554
Now, obviously, you came here to do-
your lap. Yes. Which wasn't easy.

37:57.394 --> 37:58.914
The sight that greeted us
this morning,

37:59.554 --> 38:02.794
let's have a look at the pictures
we've got. This is our track.

38:04.834 --> 38:09.634
That is what... Yeah.
With light sleet.

38:10.834 --> 38:13.354
So, realistically, you were never
going to set the fastest time.

38:15.154 --> 38:18.034
You know, it's quite nerve-wracking-
coming to do this
for the first time.

38:18.594 --> 38:19.714
You think, what's my limit?

38:20.634 --> 38:22.795
At what point do I just follow
through a bit? You know.

38:23.394 --> 38:27.314
And will that be
on the first corner?

38:28.834 --> 38:30.794
And when I saw the weather,
it was oddly relaxing.

38:32.314 --> 38:34.154
You were thinking, now I can't win,-
so it doesn't matter?

38:34.234 --> 38:35.194
Yeah, then I thought...

38:37.114 --> 38:38.954
Then everyone was going, it's going-
to be great fun, it's quite icy
out there,

38:39.034 --> 38:41.514
you'll be able to lose the back end-
and throw it around a bit.

38:42.034 --> 38:44.715
I was going, how do you know I'm
going to be able to do any of that?

38:45.234 --> 38:47.114
Well, who'd like to see him
doing a bit of that?

38:47.154 --> 38:48.394
Yes!

38:49.994 --> 38:52.594
These are some of the practice laps.
Let's just run the tape here.

38:54.194 --> 38:57.274
Now, this is the follow-through.
The
fastest part, that's pretty ballsy.

38:58.194 --> 38:59.474
And...

39:00.554 --> 39:02.954
I wouldn't want to go off there
because it's pretty fast.

39:03.698 --> 39:04.818
Second to last corner, yep.

39:06.298 --> 39:07.298
Well held!

39:10.578 --> 39:12.978
Is it well held?
Yes, it is well held!

39:13.805 --> 39:15.085
And that one is?

39:17.965 --> 39:21.165
I do like your determination to
keep
going. Because of the camera!

39:23.365 --> 39:25.665
More rally driving, I think, today.-
Very good, though.

39:27.925 --> 39:30.045
Eventually, you did manage
to get a lap in. Yes.

39:31.005 --> 39:34.585
Who here would like to see that?
Let's go.

39:38.194 --> 39:39.034
And they're off!

39:40.834 --> 39:42.074
Determined.

39:43.154 --> 39:45.154
Coming up to the first corner,
just wet there,

39:45.194 --> 39:46.754
nothing much to worry about.

39:47.954 --> 39:49.474
Now there's something
to worry about!

39:50.954 --> 39:54.194
Oooh. That's slightly scary
when the back does that.

39:55.834 --> 39:57.354
Keep it on the throttle, Damo!

40:07.714 --> 40:09.794
Change gear now. Now!

40:10.994 --> 40:13.434
Braking's not easy into
the Hammerhead at the best of times.

40:13.474 --> 40:15.714
In those conditions...

40:16.394 --> 40:17.634
Ooh, a dab of handbrake!

40:18.434 --> 40:20.954
I see a dab of handbrake
and a bit of under... Change gear!

40:21.754 --> 40:24.274
The Skandi flick. I believe.
It was a Skandi flick.

40:25.914 --> 40:29.274
No racing driver should have to
put his windscreen wipers on.
Do you know what I mean?

40:31.074 --> 40:33.054
When they're rallying,
that is quite normal.

40:33.554 --> 40:35.914
I wouldn't want to be going over
there at anything more...

40:36.714 --> 40:38.954
Can he make it all the way
through the tyres?

40:39.634 --> 40:40.594
Yup!

40:41.514 --> 40:44.914
Back into the fast bit. Now, can he-
get to the second last corner
right?

40:44.994 --> 40:46.234
Yes... No!

40:46.874 --> 40:48.274
Yes!

40:49.194 --> 40:50.994
Into Gambon. Looking good.

40:51.954 --> 40:53.314
Oh, no! No!

41:02.274 --> 41:05.754
That was a lot of fun.
That was tremendous.

41:09.114 --> 41:11.914
That does look like a lot of fun.
It
was a lot of fun. It was terrific.

41:12.674 --> 41:14.074
So where do you think you've come?

41:18.794 --> 41:22.994
So far, the slowest man we've ever
had round here was John Prescott.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.314
In a 1.56.7. Yes.

41:27.114 --> 41:29.074
Damian Lewis, you did it in...

41:32.234 --> 41:33.354
Two minutes...

41:36.834 --> 41:37.914
nine seconds...

41:39.994 --> 41:40.954
point one!

41:43.034 --> 41:43.834
But...

41:51.714 --> 41:54.114
Should we have
a separate board for snow?

41:55.754 --> 41:58.954
So I think you're the fastest
person
we've ever had in the snow.

42:00.434 --> 42:01.554
So we'll put you up there.

42:04.194 --> 42:04.994
It's good!

42:11.394 --> 42:13.074
I have to say, actually... Great.

42:14.034 --> 42:17.674
I do have to say, that is
the slowest lap we've ever had.

42:20.554 --> 42:23.114
But, and I'm sure everyone
will agree with me on this,

42:23.754 --> 42:25.314
by far and away
the most entertaining.

42:25.394 --> 42:27.034
Ladies and gentlemen, Damian Lewis!

42:37.754 --> 42:41.794
Now, so far in this programme, James has
been rallying in a £150,000 Bentley,

42:43.554 --> 42:46.074
and I've raced around our track
in an £800,000 Pagani.

42:46.914 --> 42:49.554
So someone's got to bring it all
back down to earth.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.994
Yes, and unfortunately
that person is Jeremy.

42:54.514 --> 42:57.994
Yes, as usual, it falls to me
to be the voice of reason
and common sense.

42:58.834 --> 43:03.994
With this, the Peel P50,
the smallest car ever made.

43:05.074 --> 43:09.554
Until now. Because I have created,
behold, this!

43:14.794 --> 43:17.954
Now, I know. I know.

43:19.034 --> 43:20.854
Incredulity is often
the first response.

43:21.514 --> 43:22.974
But let me talk you through it.

43:23.114 --> 43:27.314
Because underneath the handcrafted
aluminium bodywork,

43:28.274 --> 43:31.794
you have the engine and the running-
gear from a quad bike.

43:33.154 --> 43:37.474
But you will note it has lights
and indicators and a number plate.

43:38.874 --> 43:40.514
It's passed
all the Government tests,

43:40.794 --> 43:43.034
which means you can drive it
on the road.

43:44.234 --> 43:47.474
Are you seriously suggesting that
that is an actual car?

43:48.394 --> 43:52.034
I promise it's a real car. What's
it
called? Well, that's brilliant.

43:52.874 --> 43:55.114
Because it's shorter and narrower
than a Peel P50,

43:55.914 --> 43:58.154
I've called it the P45.

44:00.194 --> 44:01.714
Now I'm going to test it.

44:02.514 --> 44:04.914
What, you're going to test a car
that you built? Yes.

44:05.834 --> 44:08.334
So what are we going to do next
week? VW tests its new Golf?

44:09.114 --> 44:11.634
Shut up! I'm going to be completely-
unbiased, as you shall see.

44:18.474 --> 44:19.754
I began on the track.

44:22.234 --> 44:26.594
And having determined very quickly
that the P45 was exquisite
in every way,

44:27.514 --> 44:29.474
I took it onto the public highway.

44:33.034 --> 44:35.514
I should make it plain this is
Base L model that I'm driving now,

44:35.554 --> 44:37.354
but there are some optional extras.

44:38.154 --> 44:39.954
Urgh! Nothing wrong.

44:40.754 --> 44:42.154
Edit that out.

44:43.234 --> 44:44.194
There is, for instance,

44:44.994 --> 44:47.914
the deluxe wash wipe option
which costs just £1.99.

44:49.314 --> 44:49.994
Good.

44:51.234 --> 44:55.834
And also, for just £500, this does
come with satellite navigation.

44:59.594 --> 45:01.114
There's the sat nav. You see?

45:02.654 --> 45:04.512
You just hold it up
and see where you're going.

45:04.513 --> 45:06.594
The P45 is designed to deal
with all eventualities.

45:09.954 --> 45:10.634
I'm relaxed.

45:14.114 --> 45:16.074
So, I decided to join the main road.

45:18.554 --> 45:21.074
Yes, look at this! Look at this!
Very brilliant.

45:22.154 --> 45:24.954
Oh! Oh my God!

45:26.154 --> 45:29.154
If you're watching this in the edit,
make sure that doesn't go
on television.

45:29.194 --> 45:31.234
I don't want people thinking
it's a death trap.

45:33.874 --> 45:35.734
It happened again.
Edit that out as well.

45:36.634 --> 45:38.734
I can't believe how quiet
the roads are this morning.

45:38.834 --> 45:40.954
I'm barely seeing
any traffic at all.

45:44.834 --> 45:46.754
As I neared Guildford,
I did find a jam,

45:47.554 --> 45:50.634
but this was no problem
for the super narrow P45.

45:51.994 --> 45:54.394
The speed machine is coming
through!

45:57.154 --> 46:00.114
Ah! Oh! Oh! Nothing wrong.

46:04.394 --> 46:05.794
Oh, yes!

46:06.714 --> 46:08.394
This is incredible.
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:09.474 --> 46:12.674
you are witnessing
the birth of the future.

46:14.154 --> 46:17.114
I'm staggered that
Ford, General Motors, Toyota,

46:17.914 --> 46:20.834
all the automotive giants, haven't
thought to make a car like this.

46:22.914 --> 46:25.554
And yet, a poky little motoring
show
on BBC...

46:26.074 --> 46:28.474
Ow!

46:30.954 --> 46:35.714
This is the way to drive the P45,
with your face on the windscreen,

46:37.074 --> 46:39.594
then it can't smash into it.

46:41.514 --> 46:43.474
For local commuting,
my car is faultless.

46:44.554 --> 46:47.234
But what if
you want to go further afield?

46:48.034 --> 46:49.954
To find out,
I pulled into a petrol station

46:50.354 --> 46:52.474
and without even getting out,
I brimmed its tank.

46:59.874 --> 47:00.674
Good.

47:03.874 --> 47:04.954
Damn!

47:05.914 --> 47:08.114
I only have a 1.7-litre fuel tank,

47:08.954 --> 47:12.034
but the minimum delivery
here is two litres.

47:22.234 --> 47:24.474
Discretely, I squirted
the difference into a bin.

47:25.514 --> 47:26.914
I didn't see anything.

47:29.234 --> 47:31.314
Then I fired up the two-stroke,
100cc engine

47:32.114 --> 47:33.954
and set off to London.

47:34.874 --> 47:37.514
Technically, I'm legally allowed
to drive the P45 on motorways

47:38.034 --> 47:39.994
and dual carriageways.

47:41.754 --> 47:45.114
To see how it gets on,
I'm about to join the fearsome A3.

47:49.714 --> 47:50.554
Here we go.

47:51.474 --> 47:52.194
Ooh.

47:52.674 --> 47:55.354
Aarghhh!

47:56.434 --> 47:58.954
Arghh! I've never been frightened
of a Citroen Picasso before

47:59.474 --> 48:00.594
and I just was!

48:01.794 --> 48:03.314
Aarghhh! A van!

48:04.154 --> 48:05.714
Arghh! I've got a weave on!

48:05.914 --> 48:07.034
Ohhh!

48:08.674 --> 48:11.914
Oh, yes! Help me! HELP!

48:12.834 --> 48:14.354
How fast is that now?

48:15.194 --> 48:18.234
34! Arghh! Lorry, lorry,
lorry, lorry!

48:19.034 --> 48:22.114
Ohhh! A lot of poo shot out then!

48:23.914 --> 48:28.114
While this may be legal,
it's also completely terrifying.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.594
However, the advantage of a car
this small is that

48:32.234 --> 48:34.474
you don't have to take
it on dual carriageways.

48:36.674 --> 48:40.194
In fact, you don't have to use
the main roads at all.

48:46.474 --> 48:49.274
What you do instead is you drive it-
to the railway station

48:50.474 --> 48:53.994
but instead of leaving it in the
car
park to be vandalised and stolen,

48:54.914 --> 48:57.154
you take it on the train with you.

48:58.954 --> 49:00.474
I will be honest.

49:01.394 --> 49:03.854
None of the train companies
we contacted would play ball

49:04.194 --> 49:06.394
so I'm using the coach instead.

49:07.754 --> 49:09.874
Coach is good.
Coach is better than a train.

49:11.354 --> 49:13.434
Fewer diseases on a coach.

49:18.034 --> 49:19.894
Of course,
when you get to the big city,

49:20.474 --> 49:22.154
you don't have to use
the tube or the bus

49:22.954 --> 49:24.514
because you have your car WITH you.

49:28.834 --> 49:29.514
Ah.

49:34.314 --> 49:35.394
Oh, dear.

49:44.794 --> 49:46.314
I don't think...

49:49.074 --> 49:49.914
Just cut the cameras.

49:50.714 --> 49:52.334
In London, I went for
a little drive.

49:52.514 --> 49:53.594
Yes!

49:54.834 --> 49:57.154
All sorts of hand signals
available. If I want to go...

49:57.434 --> 49:59.674
left, right, somebody annoys me.

50:01.874 --> 50:03.394
Then I went shopping.

50:04.874 --> 50:06.674
With the P45,
there's no need to pay.

50:11.834 --> 50:14.794
Or waste time
looking for a parking space.

50:17.394 --> 50:18.794
Oh, dear.

50:20.714 --> 50:24.354
Of course,
a Peel P50 also fits in a lift,

50:25.154 --> 50:27.794
but because it has no reverse gear,-
you can't back it out again.

50:28.594 --> 50:30.714
Unless there's a newsreader to hand.

50:32.074 --> 50:33.594
This, though,
does have a reverse gear.

50:34.274 --> 50:36.354
So... here we go.

50:39.834 --> 50:45.874
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,-
beep, beep, beep, beep...

50:47.474 --> 50:49.154
I know what you're thinking.
There's no way you'd be allowed

50:49.834 --> 50:52.074
to drive around here with
a two-stroke engine

50:52.874 --> 50:55.035
belching fumes into the faces of
all the baby children.

50:56.034 --> 50:57.094
But here's the thing.

50:57.394 --> 50:59.634
The P45 is a hybrid.

51:00.834 --> 51:02.114
When you come inside,
you can disconnect the petrol
engine

51:02.754 --> 51:04.594
and connect up
a couple of electric motors.

51:07.474 --> 51:10.554
A very simple job. You take off a
wheel, connect a free wheeling hub...

51:11.314 --> 51:15.394
It takes a couple of guys... minutes.

51:26.594 --> 51:27.874
There are a couple of drawbacks.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.314
Number one,
the top speed is now 3mph.

51:32.114 --> 51:35.914
Number two, the batteries will
only last an hour.

51:36.834 --> 51:39.754
But I'm a man and I can't
think of any shopping expedition

51:40.434 --> 51:43.234
that could possibly take
longer than that.

51:45.874 --> 51:48.674
Shoes, I've got some,
I don't need any of those.

51:50.874 --> 51:51.834
I've got a chair.

51:53.034 --> 51:54.314
There's nothing I want to buy.

51:55.674 --> 51:57.314
Eventually, I bought
a present for James.

51:59.394 --> 52:01.914
Then I decided to find out
just how quiet my car is

52:03.114 --> 52:04.354
in electric mode

52:05.034 --> 52:06.434
so I took it here.

52:12.834 --> 52:14.514
This is extraordinary.

52:16.594 --> 52:18.554
Nobody's looking up.
Nobody's noticing me.

52:21.154 --> 52:24.594
The only trouble is that libraries are
more interesting than shopping centres.

52:25.674 --> 52:27.074
Whoa. History Of Germany.

52:28.274 --> 52:30.514
Can't be that big just to say,
"We lost a lot."

52:33.154 --> 52:34.554
An hour flew by.

52:35.194 --> 52:36.514
Get out of the way, student.

52:37.514 --> 52:39.034
Soon, the batteries were flat.

52:40.274 --> 52:41.674
Oh, no.

52:44.394 --> 52:46.474
Now, if this were a Peel P50,
I could pick it up

52:47.314 --> 52:48.954
and carry it out.

52:49.914 --> 52:52.274
But I'm afraid the P45
is a bit heavier.

52:53.234 --> 52:54.474
A lot heavier. Weighs a tonne.

52:59.914 --> 53:01.194
There's only one thing for it.

53:09.314 --> 53:10.594
This is so embarrassing.

53:16.234 --> 53:19.754
Sorry. Sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry. Really, I'm so sorry.

53:21.674 --> 53:23.474
That night I was due to go
to a show.

53:24.554 --> 53:25.634
Oh, yes!

53:26.314 --> 53:27.714
Stupid idiot!

53:28.914 --> 53:30.994
As I was running late,
I decided to take a short cut.

53:31.954 --> 53:34.194
Look here. "Cyclists not allowed."

53:35.394 --> 53:38.434
Good.
I'm not a cyclist so here I come.

53:40.914 --> 53:41.594
Hello...

53:47.194 --> 53:48.714
Come on. Quickly...

53:52.514 --> 53:53.754
I'm really sorry.

53:55.234 --> 53:56.634
Soon I was in the West End...

53:57.594 --> 53:58.674
Arghh!

53:59.754 --> 54:01.314
And nearing the theatre.

54:04.634 --> 54:06.874
This is the joy of a P45.

54:07.794 --> 54:09.594
Everything is a drive-through.

54:11.114 --> 54:12.474
Hello. One, please.

54:15.674 --> 54:16.794
Thank you very much.

54:19.754 --> 54:20.594
Ooh...

54:22.114 --> 54:23.074
There you go.

54:30.554 --> 54:31.914
The show was ace!

54:36.034 --> 54:38.114
Not a single gay man on that stage.

54:40.954 --> 54:42.994
However, my seating arrangements
were a bit cramped.

54:56.114 --> 54:58.194
Oh, no. Cut. Cut.

54:58.874 --> 55:00.794
The next morning,
it was clear to me that the P45

55:00.954 --> 55:04.034
was excellent but would it make
commercial sense

55:04.794 --> 55:06.194
to put it into production?

55:06.994 --> 55:09.394
To find out, I'd set up
an important business meeting.

55:10.874 --> 55:13.834
To make sure I look my best,
I'm wearing a suit, as you can see.

55:15.594 --> 55:17.674
I've washed my hair
and now I'm going to give the car

55:18.474 --> 55:20.434
a wash and brush-up as well.

55:25.874 --> 55:26.994
Now, here we go. Yes.

55:28.474 --> 55:30.874
Arghh! It's not warm!
It's extremely cold!

55:32.314 --> 55:37.074
Oh, yes! People pay many pounds
for this in countries...

55:44.034 --> 55:45.594
This has gone quite badly.

55:46.674 --> 55:49.034
What's happened here?
A terrible thing has happened.

55:51.914 --> 55:52.914
A bad thing has happened.

55:53.674 --> 55:55.634
I've got completely wedged.

55:58.194 --> 56:02.114
With the P45 untangled, I headed
off to my big business meeting.

56:18.114 --> 56:22.154
First of all, I'd like to
apologise for my... wet sleeves

56:23.114 --> 56:25.314
and my bloodshot eye -
I got soap in it.

56:26.154 --> 56:27.274
We'll gloss over that.

56:27.914 --> 56:31.394
Right, erm...
Cars are getting bigger, these days.

56:32.354 --> 56:34.434
I've got a picture of an original
Ford Cortina, which

56:34.714 --> 56:36.154
I'm sure you won't remember,
Deborah!

56:38.154 --> 56:39.394
And the modern Mondeo.

56:40.874 --> 56:42.914
It's the same story with the Golf
and the same story

56:43.234 --> 56:45.194
with the Fiesta and it's ridiculous

56:46.834 --> 56:49.474
when we live in a country
as cramped as ours.

56:50.274 --> 56:51.674
So cars should be getting smaller.

56:52.354 --> 56:54.474
That is where this comes in.

56:55.794 --> 56:57.754
This is my creation.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.074
The P45.

57:02.674 --> 57:05.754
The idea is you can drive this
to a railway station

57:06.554 --> 57:08.194
and then you pop
it on a train or a coach,

57:09.194 --> 57:11.434
go to the next city
and you can use it there as well.

57:12.074 --> 57:13.034
It's road legal...

57:13.994 --> 57:16.155
Can I make sure, because I might
have missed something?

57:16.474 --> 57:19.634
You started off apologising why your arms
were wet and then didn't explain why.

57:20.434 --> 57:22.394
Because they've got water on them.

57:25.874 --> 57:28.794
I travel back and forth
from the West Country on the train.

57:29.754 --> 57:31.154
You say you can take that with you.

57:31.954 --> 57:33.474
That looks quite big
to get on a train.

57:33.994 --> 57:36.514
That's because train companies
put seats in their carriages,

57:37.194 --> 57:39.274
which they needn't do with this.

57:40.034 --> 57:42.634
If you just produced a carriage,
you could drive in and sit there.

57:43.234 --> 57:45.274
Hold on. At the moment,
you can't get it on a train?

57:47.674 --> 57:50.194
Not as such. You've got to
rely on the train companies

57:50.994 --> 57:53.275
redesigning their trains for you
to get this on the train?

57:53.874 --> 57:55.834
Redesigning is easy -
you just take the seats out.

57:56.914 --> 57:58.594
OK. I, erm...

57:59.954 --> 58:02.034
Jeremy,
is this your first business
venture?

58:05.114 --> 58:05.914
Yes.

58:07.434 --> 58:08.554
What would it cost,
one of these, on the road?

58:09.194 --> 58:12.674
- £8,000. £8,000?
- What would you make them for?

58:13.314 --> 58:16.074
- It'll cost £4,000 to build.
- By children or will you get adults?

58:16.714 --> 58:19.314
Can he get children to work in a
factory? That would be brilliant.

58:21.714 --> 58:23.674
Jeremy has asked if he
could get children

58:24.474 --> 58:26.154
to work in a factory.

58:26.954 --> 58:28.314
Come and have a look.

58:29.114 --> 58:31.234
Theo Paphitis decides to take
a closer look.

58:35.954 --> 58:37.754
Jeremy. It's chit. It isn't!

58:38.714 --> 58:41.074
It is. Total and utter chit.

58:41.874 --> 58:44.394
Theo Paphitis thinks Jeremy's car
still needs work.

58:45.634 --> 58:48.274
I don't understand why you're not
seeing what I'm seeing here.

58:48.954 --> 58:50.074
We are, Jeremy.

58:50.874 --> 58:52.475
I can see exactly what
you're looking at.

58:53.754 --> 58:55.954
It's just that I can see that it's
loopy and you can't.

58:56.794 --> 58:59.234
How much of YOUR money have you
invested in this? None at all.

59:00.114 --> 59:02.874
That is the best thing that
you've done yet.

59:03.674 --> 59:06.754
Do you have a plan? Do you have any
idea of the size of the market,

59:07.594 --> 59:09.234
are you going to sell it
to that market?

59:11.154 --> 59:12.674
Yes. So, size of the market.

59:13.474 --> 59:17.434
1,600 a month.
1,600 a month? Or a year.

59:22.554 --> 59:24.314
Well, Jeremy.
I'm going to make you an offer.

59:24.754 --> 59:25.754
That's the ticket!

59:26.394 --> 59:27.794
£1 for 1%.

59:30.554 --> 59:31.674
Why would anybody buy this?

59:37.234 --> 59:40.314
It's got stripes on it.
I couldn't invest in you.

59:41.114 --> 59:44.834
- I'm sorry. I'm out.
- Jeremy, I have to say one thing.

59:45.914 --> 59:47.714
It is the smartest
I've ever seen you.

59:48.674 --> 59:50.194
Congratulations for that.

59:50.874 --> 59:52.314
You've made, clearly, a real effort.

59:52.754 --> 59:54.874
However, I can't invest
in ridiculous things.

59:55.834 --> 59:57.914
On that basis, I'm going to have
to tell you I'm out.

59:59.114 --> 01:00:01.794
Jeremy, it's rubbish. It's useless.

01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:04.114
You're wasting your time.

01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:07.594
I can't invest in this. I'm out.

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:11.194
Theo Paphitis is out,
which means Jeremy's only chance

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.394
is Duncan Bannatyne.

01:00:14.634 --> 01:00:15.474
Well, Jeremy.

01:00:16.794 --> 01:00:18.554
I'm the last Dragon in.
I tried to tempt them

01:00:19.154 --> 01:00:21.274
by making an offer,
hoping they would come in with me.

01:00:23.594 --> 01:00:26.114
Sorry, I can't understand
a word you're saying.

01:00:30.954 --> 01:00:32.354
That is... I'm out.

01:00:33.594 --> 01:00:37.034
Jeremy has insulted Duncan
Bannatyne and now he too is out.

01:00:39.674 --> 01:00:42.754
All the Dragons have given him
his P45.

01:00:51.074 --> 01:00:52.874
Well, I'm sorry...

01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:56.874
I'm unbowed by their negativity.

01:00:57.834 --> 01:01:00.274
How can they not realise this is
a car you NEVER need to park?

01:01:00.714 --> 01:01:03.114
You can go to the theatre in it,
shopping, your arms are free

01:01:03.914 --> 01:01:05.714
so you can reach things from
the shelves.

01:01:06.394 --> 01:01:07.754
You never need get out of it.

01:01:08.434 --> 01:01:11.234
Which is ironic because the first
thing anyone will want to do

01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:13.154
on getting in, is get out of it.

01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:15.954
It's a death trap.

01:01:17.194 --> 01:01:18.434
I feel like Vincent Van Gogh.

01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:21.795
You've only got one ear? No.
Nobody recognised his genius

01:01:22.314 --> 01:01:24.114
until AFTER he died.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.834
What you're saying is,
for this to be a commercial success,

01:01:28.514 --> 01:01:30.874
you have to be dead?

01:01:34.434 --> 01:01:35.834
Yes.

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:38.714
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:01:39.954 --> 01:01:43.714
Thank you for watching. They'll see-
you next week. Good night!
