00:32.500 --> 00:36.493
? Don't you know
that I love you ?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.537
Ha ha ha!

00:40.574 --> 00:42.303
<i>It's gold, just like they said.</i>

00:42.342 --> 00:43.707
Yes, sir!

00:43.742 --> 00:45.642
<i>Gold, gold! Ha ha!</i>

00:45.678 --> 00:48.112
<i>Really, really fine.</i>

00:48.147 --> 00:51.139
Well, I must admit,
you boys got a lot of nerve...

00:51.182 --> 00:53.980
pulling a mining robbery
like that.

00:54.018 --> 00:56.486
In broad daylight, no less!

00:57.921 --> 01:01.322
Yeah, shooting up
all them good white folks.

01:01.358 --> 01:04.794
Well, it comes with
the territory.

01:04.827 --> 01:08.092
Ha ha! Well, gentlemen...

01:08.130 --> 01:11.622
I'm prepared to go
10,000 apiece.

01:11.666 --> 01:13.793
- What?
- What you talking, $10,000?

01:13.835 --> 01:18.898
No, we agreed.
$200,000 on delivery.

01:18.939 --> 01:21.499
It seems to me
things have changed.

01:21.542 --> 01:26.673
Right now, this ore is hotter
than Memphis in July.

01:26.713 --> 01:29.876
Now, you boys got to
turn it into cold cash.

01:29.916 --> 01:31.975
There's only two people
who can do that...

01:32.017 --> 01:33.314
and I'm one of them.

01:33.352 --> 01:35.149
I suggest you take my offer.

01:35.187 --> 01:38.020
Lester, you trying to cheat us,
you cheap bastard.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.856
Hush up, baby girl.
I'll handle this.

01:41.892 --> 01:46.761
You're trying to cheat us,
you dirty bastard...

01:46.796 --> 01:49.390
and I'm very disappointed
in you.

01:49.432 --> 01:53.027
Well, boy, I'll tell you,
take it or leave it.

01:53.068 --> 01:56.094
<i>? Hold you I love you ?</i>

02:01.542 --> 02:04.534
It ain't gonna go
this way, Lester.

02:04.579 --> 02:06.240
You think about it again.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.374
<i>Drop your hands!
Drop your damn hands!</i>

02:11.118 --> 02:13.848
- Get your hands down!
- Move over! Move over!

02:13.886 --> 02:15.319
<i>That's right.</i>

02:15.354 --> 02:18.619
I don't do business with niggers
who pull guns on me.

02:20.126 --> 02:22.560
Lester, baby...

02:22.594 --> 02:26.086
you gone and picked
the wrong niggers...

02:26.131 --> 02:28.258
to call niggers.

02:37.106 --> 02:40.132
What the hell is
that thing on your nose?

02:40.176 --> 02:44.704
It's distracting.
Ought to be removed.

02:44.746 --> 02:49.012
My man Jodie here,
he's an expert cosmic surgeon.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.711
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah!

02:50.751 --> 02:52.082
Ain't you, Jodie?

02:52.119 --> 02:57.580
Oh, yeah! I-I-let me
have a look-see, Slim.

02:57.624 --> 03:01.082
Oh, that's dog ugly.

03:01.127 --> 03:02.958
- Ugly!
- Ugly, mm-hmm!

03:02.995 --> 03:07.728
- Lester, it's gotta go.
- Gotta go.

03:07.766 --> 03:08.892
Nurse...

03:08.934 --> 03:11.767
No killing, Slim.

03:11.803 --> 03:14.795
<i>Who's the other fence, Lester?</i>

03:14.839 --> 03:15.806
<i>Uh...</i>

03:15.840 --> 03:17.774
Pop go the weasel.

03:17.808 --> 03:21.471
Aah!
You niggers rot in hell!

03:21.511 --> 03:25.743
Doctor, I think you ought
to sterilize that wound.

03:25.781 --> 03:28.215
<i>Don't use that acid, Slim!</i>

03:31.853 --> 03:33.081
Go on around.

03:33.121 --> 03:36.181
No! No! It's Easy Money
up in Harlem!

03:36.224 --> 03:39.751
Easy Money?
The dude that own the Royale?

03:39.793 --> 03:42.353
That's him! I swear!
Get that acid away from my face!

03:42.396 --> 03:45.331
Bo! Get our shit
and get the hell outta here.

03:45.364 --> 03:47.855
Come on, y'all, let's go.

03:50.369 --> 03:52.701
- Slim...
- What?

03:52.738 --> 03:54.501
You're gonna kill him,
ain't you?

03:54.539 --> 03:57.508
Go help Bo.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.169
You promised me no more killing!

03:59.210 --> 04:02.611
Get the hell outta here.
Always got to run your mouth!

04:08.218 --> 04:09.412
Come on, Hank.

04:09.452 --> 04:12.319
Let's see if we can fry him
like a pork chop.

04:12.355 --> 04:13.549
- Burn him!
- Ha ha ha!

04:18.994 --> 04:21.656
<i>Lester, you're gonna
look like sloppy chitlins.</i>

04:21.696 --> 04:22.822
Jodie!

04:22.864 --> 04:26.061
- It's the sheriff!
- You set us up!

04:26.100 --> 04:29.399
Y'all got ten seconds
to get your ass out here!

04:29.436 --> 04:30.630
Fire!

04:33.006 --> 04:36.237
<i>God damn it, it's Lester!</i>

04:36.275 --> 04:37.674
Shoot the bastards!

04:39.979 --> 04:41.173
Aah!

04:43.181 --> 04:45.012
<i>Imabelle!</i>

04:48.719 --> 04:49.879
Aah!

04:49.920 --> 04:51.148
Fuck you, nigger!

04:54.291 --> 04:56.657
- Aaah!
- Back up!

05:06.368 --> 05:10.737
<i>Stop her! No!
Don't let her get away!</i>

07:08.577 --> 07:11.137
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

07:11.618 --> 07:13.984
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

07:14.021 --> 07:16.080
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

07:16.122 --> 07:18.283
Help me, somebody. Mmm!

07:18.324 --> 07:20.292
<i>Christy, you forgot
your Hula-Hoop!</i>

07:20.326 --> 07:22.886
Young and tender inspiration!

07:22.927 --> 07:24.292
<i>Dirty old man.</i>

07:24.329 --> 07:26.991
<i>Damn shame.
? Give to the blind ?</i>

07:27.032 --> 07:29.865
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

07:46.515 --> 07:48.176
Lord...

07:48.216 --> 07:51.549
thank you for letting me
wake up in my right mind.

08:05.531 --> 08:07.328
Lord...

08:07.366 --> 08:11.700
last night
after depositing $4.25..

08:11.736 --> 08:15.172
Of my hard-earned money
into my bank account...

08:15.206 --> 08:18.903
I passed the $1,500 mark...

08:18.942 --> 08:25.142
my new balance
now being $1,500.25.

08:25.181 --> 08:28.912
Thank you for
making me provident...

08:28.951 --> 08:32.148
and for not putting
obstacles in my way.

08:32.187 --> 08:36.020
Such as... women.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.719
Amen.

08:42.429 --> 08:45.557
And they snatched her purse
right off her arm.

08:45.598 --> 08:46.826
Lord have mercy.

08:46.866 --> 08:49.391
I don't know what's wrong
with these children today.

08:49.435 --> 08:52.097
Nothing that a good ass-kicking
wouldn't help.

08:52.137 --> 08:53.297
You go right ahead.

08:53.338 --> 08:56.796
Thank you, honey.
You got manners to spare.

08:56.842 --> 09:00.403
His mama
really raised him right.

09:00.444 --> 09:02.708
Well, I hope he enjoyed himself.

09:02.746 --> 09:07.308
She probably the only woman
he'll ever have.

09:07.350 --> 09:09.875
Sorry. All full up.

09:16.658 --> 09:18.592
As salaam alaikum, my brother.

09:18.627 --> 09:21.425
What are you
saying to me, Claude X?

09:21.462 --> 09:23.896
You speak English to me.
You just say hello.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.229
Hell is low, brother man.

09:26.267 --> 09:29.668
That's much better,
and very true.

09:29.703 --> 09:33.537
<i>Rodney, meet me over on 110!</i>

09:45.016 --> 09:47.576
- Jackson!
- You're late!

09:47.619 --> 09:49.109
I'm sorry.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.518
- Jackson!
- Yes, sir?

09:50.554 --> 09:53.785
- You're late!
- I'm sorry. I just-

09:53.824 --> 09:54.984
I know, I know.

09:55.024 --> 09:57.288
Next time get on the bus,
no matter what!

09:57.326 --> 09:58.691
We got dead people
to tend to here.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.161
You think
they gonna wait on you?

10:00.196 --> 10:02.926
<i>Oh, no, sir.</i>

10:04.966 --> 10:08.197
<i>? Ooh, ooh, ooh ?</i>

10:08.236 --> 10:09.931
Shake it!
I'm ready to go!

10:09.970 --> 10:13.565
- Ohh...
- Hey, Goldy.

10:13.607 --> 10:15.302
Say, Goldy!

10:15.342 --> 10:18.709
<i>? Just yesterday
skies were cloudy and gray ?</i>

10:18.745 --> 10:21.475
You must be some kind of
mathematical genius...

10:21.514 --> 10:23.539
keeping all those numbers
in your head.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.015
Well, you know how it is.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.245
Notepads look too much
like evidence.

10:27.286 --> 10:29.720
Yeah, well,
I'm very disturbed...

10:29.755 --> 10:32.087
that one of your people
hit for ten grand.

10:32.123 --> 10:33.715
It ruined my weekend, Goldy.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.918
What can I say?

10:34.959 --> 10:36.586
Old man Dixon's
been playing for years.

10:36.627 --> 10:39.152
- He never won a dime.
- Yeah.

10:39.196 --> 10:42.529
Suppose we just say
you remembered wrong.

10:42.566 --> 10:44.227
You see, I hear he's due...

10:44.266 --> 10:47.030
to take a little fall
down a flight of stairs.

10:47.069 --> 10:51.506
You want to chump on the rest
of your people, you do that...

10:51.539 --> 10:53.302
but anybody bets with me
gets paid.

10:53.341 --> 10:55.206
<i>You understand what I'm saying?</i>

10:56.611 --> 10:58.340
What's the matter
with this guy?

10:58.378 --> 11:00.107
How come you always
looking to try me?

11:00.147 --> 11:02.240
I'm gonna try you again.

11:02.282 --> 11:03.772
You ain't gonna try me now.

11:03.817 --> 11:05.580
Goldy, Goldy...

11:05.618 --> 11:08.985
Hey, my friend...

11:09.021 --> 11:11.046
I'll let Dixon off this time.

11:11.090 --> 11:13.149
<i>But it's the principle
of the thing.</i>

11:13.191 --> 11:16.683
I got one rule in life...

11:16.728 --> 11:20.289
don't give nothing to nobody.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.099
Take it easy, my man.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.067
Drive. Come on.

11:34.910 --> 11:38.107
<i>Mm-mmm!</i>

11:38.146 --> 11:40.376
Yum yum yum yum yum.

11:40.414 --> 11:43.941
<i>Yum Yum Yum yum!
Mmm! Pow!</i>

11:55.394 --> 11:56.793
Put it in for me, honey.

11:56.829 --> 12:00.060
Whenever, wherever, and however.

12:01.399 --> 12:04.129
- Uhh!
- Mm-hmm.

12:04.168 --> 12:06.602
- Hey, Charlie!
- Yeah?

12:06.638 --> 12:09.505
- Give me a hand, huh?
- Oh, all right.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.456
Yaah! Jackson!
Ha ha ha!

12:35.496 --> 12:38.363
You boys quit messing
with the corpses!

12:38.398 --> 12:40.457
I ain't joking around,
you know!

12:40.500 --> 12:42.263
Yes, Mr. Clay.

12:42.302 --> 12:43.769
You getting ready for
the Undertaker's Ball tonight?

12:43.802 --> 12:44.894
We'll find you a woman.

12:44.936 --> 12:47.496
I ain't got no time
for no women, Louis.

12:47.539 --> 12:49.336
We'll fix you up
with Mr. Clay's wife.

12:49.374 --> 12:52.104
The one with the big ass
like two glazed hams.

12:52.143 --> 12:53.508
Philistines!

12:53.544 --> 12:55.637
<i>She got big feet.
Cover a lot of ground.</i>

12:55.680 --> 12:57.341
Blaspheming philistines!

12:57.380 --> 13:00.747
Two big, luscious titties,
like two cassava melons.

13:00.784 --> 13:02.581
Blaspheming
philistine heathens!

13:02.619 --> 13:04.587
Man, I'm not from Philly!
Who you talking to?

13:04.620 --> 13:07.145
- I told you that!
- Hey, come on, man!

13:07.189 --> 13:10.386
Blaspheming philistine
sinning heathens.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.888
Sorry, Mr. Clay.

13:29.894 --> 13:33.887
I'm separated!
Up in a man's business!

13:34.932 --> 13:36.490
Would you look at me?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.059
$5.00 an hour,
20 for the night.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.766
What is this, the Ritz?

13:43.806 --> 13:46.536
This is New York City, honey.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.270
People don't come here
to sleep.

13:48.310 --> 13:51.074
<i>Hour's usually all they need.</i>

13:51.113 --> 13:53.479
All I got
is $4.00 to my name.

13:53.514 --> 13:56.950
Oh, yeah?
What's that shit on your finger?

13:56.984 --> 13:58.975
This is my grandmama's ring.

13:59.019 --> 14:02.682
It's going with me to my grave.

14:04.224 --> 14:06.522
All right,
you can keep your $4.00.

14:06.558 --> 14:08.355
I got a room opening up.

14:08.393 --> 14:10.520
Go on up and take a shower.

14:10.562 --> 14:12.962
You know your best bet?
You should go on over...

14:12.998 --> 14:14.898
to the Undertaker's Ball
at the Royale.

14:14.932 --> 14:18.527
Royale? That's where
I was going anyway.

14:18.569 --> 14:21.094
Well, good.
If anybody can raise the dead...

14:21.138 --> 14:25.632
and make 'em pay their rent,
it's you.

14:25.675 --> 14:30.339
Things don't work out,
you come on back home.

15:14.184 --> 15:17.210
Ooh, yeah! Yeah!
Turn me, baby! Ooh!

15:17.252 --> 15:19.982
<i>? Elevator operator ?</i>

15:20.022 --> 15:22.684
<i>? Up and down, up and down ?</i>

15:22.724 --> 15:25.750
<i>? Elevator operator ?</i>

15:25.793 --> 15:28.159
<i>? Up and down, up and down ?</i>

15:28.196 --> 15:29.629
<i>? When my day is done ?</i>

<i>? Up and down, up and down ?</i>

15:37.970 --> 15:41.133
<i>? Whoo, elevator operator ?</i>

15:41.173 --> 15:44.768
<i>? Up and down, up and down ?</i>

15:44.809 --> 15:45.969
- What'd she say?
- Yeah!

15:46.010 --> 15:47.170
I tell you
what she said, right?

15:47.212 --> 15:50.670
She says, "Smitty,
Smitty, come on over."

15:50.715 --> 15:52.080
So I go over there, right?

15:52.115 --> 15:55.107
Soon as I get to the house,
she got 12 kids, man!

15:55.152 --> 15:57.643
- What?!
- Twelve ugly kids!

15:57.688 --> 15:59.952
Every last one of 'em
looked like Dracula.

15:59.989 --> 16:01.149
All right now!

16:01.190 --> 16:02.555
<i>? Elevator operator ?</i>

16:21.107 --> 16:23.667
Now, I take the 12 kids
that look like Dracula...

16:23.710 --> 16:25.041
and put 'em in a room, right?

16:25.078 --> 16:26.909
Let 'em watch some
of that "Andy 'n' Amos."

16:26.945 --> 16:28.105
No, no. "Amos 'n' Andy."

16:28.146 --> 16:31.172
Yeah, whatever it is.
Amos and... and... right.

16:31.216 --> 16:33.241
So, I tip over
to her bedroom, right?

16:33.284 --> 16:36.617
Man, I'm riding that coochie
like the Lone Ranger.

16:36.654 --> 16:38.455
I got that Trigger thing
happening down there.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.280
<i>Smitty, I don't got time...</i>

16:41.324 --> 16:43.986
<i>for all your blaspheming
and your evil ways.</i>

16:44.027 --> 16:45.995
I'm looking for Easy Money.

16:47.129 --> 16:49.393
- Smitty...
- Ohh!

16:49.431 --> 16:52.923
<i>I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</i>

16:52.968 --> 16:54.435
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

16:54.469 --> 16:59.031
Get your goddamn hands
off me, chump.

17:00.575 --> 17:04.568
Trying to clean you off.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.476
Excuse me, but...

17:06.512 --> 17:09.242
- Do we know you?
- Not in this lifetime.

17:09.281 --> 17:10.510
- Oh!
- Whoo!

17:10.549 --> 17:12.414
<i>Hot damn!
I know that hurt you.</i>

17:12.451 --> 17:13.748
It hurt you.

17:13.786 --> 17:15.481
No, can't hurt nobody
who look like Nat Cole.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.714
Shit.

17:16.755 --> 17:18.551
You better get rid
of them shaving bumps.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.751
Man, shut up,
you old bug-eyed...

17:22.593 --> 17:26.619
<i>Yeah. Heh.
That's gold, all right.</i>

17:26.664 --> 17:30.327
<i>Mmm. Mmm. That's good.</i>

17:32.435 --> 17:35.097
But you're gonna have
to show me the rest of it...

17:35.138 --> 17:38.164
before I show you the money.

17:38.206 --> 17:40.902
<i>Now, honey, a whole lot
of people was killed...</i>

17:40.942 --> 17:43.137
<i>playing around with this stuff.</i>

17:43.177 --> 17:48.513
My partners,
white folks, police.

17:48.549 --> 17:50.278
I ain't just
flashing it around...

17:50.317 --> 17:51.909
and ending up the way they did.

17:51.951 --> 17:54.579
You know, I do believe...

17:54.621 --> 17:58.352
you and I were cut out
to do business together.

17:58.390 --> 17:59.789
But first...

17:59.825 --> 18:03.158
Yeah, baby?

18:03.195 --> 18:04.316
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

18:05.463 --> 18:08.557
Act calm.
Take it easy, baby.

18:08.599 --> 18:12.126
<i>Their bark is bigger
than their bite.</i>

18:12.169 --> 18:14.228
So, what you trying
to pin on me now?

18:14.271 --> 18:16.239
Familiar with an old man
named Julius Dixon?

18:16.273 --> 18:18.867
Hit for 10 grand on a number
Goldy sold him.

18:18.908 --> 18:21.934
It warms my head
when I can do some good...

18:21.977 --> 18:23.604
for the old folks
of the community.

18:23.646 --> 18:25.614
Yeah? Too bad he fell
down a flight of stairs...

18:25.647 --> 18:27.842
before you could pay him!

18:27.882 --> 18:31.613
You don't think
we could do this later...

18:31.653 --> 18:34.679
like in the morning?

18:34.722 --> 18:36.280
- Hell no!
- Hell no!

18:40.059 --> 18:42.118
<i>Don't worry, baby.</i>

18:42.161 --> 18:45.688
They just do this shit
to keep themselves busy.

18:45.732 --> 18:50.465
But, uh...
I got no place to stay.

18:51.903 --> 18:54.963
Stay in a hotel.

18:56.907 --> 18:58.875
But I got no money.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.403
<i>? The people quit the scene ?</i>

19:02.597 --> 19:04.087
<i>? Like the devil was loose ?</i>

19:04.132 --> 19:06.100
<i>? The clouds turned green ?</i>

19:06.134 --> 19:09.228
<i>? And letdown lemon juice ?</i>

19:09.269 --> 19:11.260
<i>? What walks on two feet ?</i>

19:11.305 --> 19:13.535
<i>? And looks like a goat? ?</i>

19:13.574 --> 19:16.907
<i>? That crazy Screaming Jay
in a bright yellow coat ?</i>

19:16.943 --> 19:18.205
<i>? Hey, now ?</i>

19:18.244 --> 19:20.735
<i>? Stick With it ?</i>

19:20.780 --> 19:24.477
<i>? Baby, baby,
don't you quit it ?</i>

19:24.516 --> 19:26.882
<i>? Ohh, you're bound to get it ?</i>

19:26.918 --> 19:28.886
<i>? Yes, sir ?</i>

19:28.919 --> 19:31.080
<i>? Made outta goat skin,
foreskin ?</i>

19:31.122 --> 19:33.920
<i>? And laying out
in milk and gin ?</i>

19:33.958 --> 19:35.585
<i>? Lord, lord, lordy ?</i>

19:44.066 --> 19:46.694
<i>? I took a plane out Midwest ?</i>

19:46.735 --> 19:48.532
<i>? To see my Uncle Joe ?</i>

19:48.570 --> 19:50.663
<i>? We ran into
some real bad weather ?</i>

19:50.705 --> 19:52.866
<i>? Ice, rain, and snow ?</i>

19:52.907 --> 19:54.898
<i>? Fifty million bulldogs ?</i>

19:54.942 --> 19:56.375
<i>? Twenty mountain goats... ?</i>

19:56.409 --> 19:59.276
Are you ready for me, daddy?

19:59.312 --> 20:02.645
Oh, I'm sorry that
I spilled that water on you.

20:02.682 --> 20:03.910
He spills a drink on me...

20:03.949 --> 20:07.407
and now he won't even ask me
for a dance.

20:07.453 --> 20:10.889
Boy ain't got no manners.

20:10.922 --> 20:13.584
Well, honey,
you're just gonna have...

20:13.625 --> 20:15.752
to make it up to me
on the dance floor, huh?

20:17.194 --> 20:19.662
Would you hold
this for me, please?

20:19.696 --> 20:20.924
Thank you.

20:20.964 --> 20:23.762
I'm gonna hold this
for you, yeah.

20:28.304 --> 20:29.464
Uh...

20:29.505 --> 20:30.972
You're not an undertaker.

20:33.308 --> 20:35.970
<i>? I put a spell on you ?</i>

20:39.246 --> 20:40.713
I'm Jackson.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.284
<i>? Because you're mine ?</i>

20:44.318 --> 20:46.149
That's my toe, Jackson.

20:46.186 --> 20:50.623
Sorry. I told you,
I don't know how to dance.

20:50.657 --> 20:53.182
Baby, it's easy.

20:53.225 --> 20:56.854
Just wrap your arms
around me...

20:56.895 --> 20:59.557
<i>? Ha ha ha, watch out ?</i>

20:59.597 --> 21:01.189
And squeeze.

21:01.232 --> 21:02.426
<i>? I ain't lying ?</i>

21:05.136 --> 21:07.366
<i>? Yeah ?</i>

21:07.404 --> 21:10.669
I know who it is.
See, that's his cousin.

21:10.707 --> 21:12.504
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.510
Then that's...
Mr. Clay's in on this...

21:14.543 --> 21:18.206
<i>that's his wife's
sister's daughter...</i>

21:18.247 --> 21:20.010
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.

21:20.048 --> 21:23.017
Then I do not know
who that woman is.

21:23.051 --> 21:24.985
But...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.588
<i>? Because ?</i>

21:32.626 --> 21:34.992
<i>? You're mine ?</i>

21:35.027 --> 21:37.291
Sorry.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.859
And don't this feel good?

21:45.003 --> 21:46.402
<i>- Whoo!
- Oh!</i>

21:46.438 --> 21:49.532
Jackson, would you like
to go outside?

21:49.573 --> 21:52.542
Because it's kinda hot in here.

21:52.576 --> 21:55.272
Um, no. Uh...

21:55.311 --> 21:59.008
Heh. I'm doing
just fine here, really.

21:59.048 --> 22:01.312
Would you like to go home?

22:02.618 --> 22:05.678
Really, don't worry about me.

22:05.721 --> 22:07.951
I'm great.

22:07.990 --> 22:10.117
Honey,
I ain't worried about you.

22:10.157 --> 22:11.454
I'm worried about me.

22:11.492 --> 22:14.325
See, I'm tired,
my feet are killing me...

22:14.362 --> 22:16.193
and I just want to sit down.

22:16.229 --> 22:17.719
Now, do you live nearby?

22:17.764 --> 22:19.391
I'm sorry?

22:19.432 --> 22:22.333
<i>? And I love you anyhow ?</i>

22:22.369 --> 22:26.567
<i>? I don't care
if you don't want me ?</i>

22:26.605 --> 22:28.038
<i>? I'm yours ?</i>

22:28.073 --> 22:30.405
<i>? Right now ?</i>

22:30.441 --> 22:33.103
<i>? I put a spell on you ?</i>

22:37.281 --> 22:38.612
Let's go.

22:38.649 --> 22:41.117
<i>? Because you're mine ?</i>

22:41.151 --> 22:43.881
<i>? Mine, mine ?</i>

22:43.919 --> 22:45.614
<i>? Ow, whoo ?</i>

22:45.655 --> 22:47.179
<i>? Ooh, you're mine ?</i>

22:53.662 --> 22:54.993
This is it.

22:57.398 --> 22:58.888
Upstairs.

23:01.969 --> 23:04.233
Jackson, I told you
never to leave...

23:04.271 --> 23:06.796
your ham-greased stuff
in my kitchen.

23:06.839 --> 23:08.033
Who is that?

23:10.076 --> 23:12.704
Well, you ain't been
fornicating all these years.

23:12.744 --> 23:16.236
I don't see how come
you want to start now.

23:16.281 --> 23:18.442
If Christ knew
what kind of Christians...

23:18.482 --> 23:19.972
he had up here in Harlem...

23:20.017 --> 23:22.918
he'd climb back up
on the cross and start over.

23:22.953 --> 23:25.547
<i>Who's that?</i>

23:25.588 --> 23:28.751
Why, that's Jesus.

23:30.427 --> 23:33.794
Now, honey,
I know who Jesus is.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.626
The other one.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.894
<i>Oh. That's my mom.</i>

23:39.467 --> 23:40.764
She's dead now.

23:40.802 --> 23:43.032
Sorry to hear that, Jackson.

23:49.476 --> 23:52.070
I'm so tired.

23:52.112 --> 23:55.980
I feel like I walked
all the way from Mississippi.

23:57.983 --> 24:00.144
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:01.653 --> 24:03.848
Would you like me
to rub your feet for you?

24:03.888 --> 24:06.379
<i>I could do that for you.</i>

24:09.393 --> 24:11.384
Sure, honey, that'd be fine.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.526
Gotta take these off.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.773
I've seen a lot of feet before.

24:31.812 --> 24:35.373
I don't think
I've seen one... so small.

24:35.415 --> 24:38.350
That's mighty sweet of you,
Jackson.

24:38.385 --> 24:41.218
So, where is it
you seen all them feet?

24:41.254 --> 24:42.949
Dead people.

24:42.988 --> 24:44.979
Jackson.

24:45.023 --> 24:46.786
Oh, you know...

24:46.825 --> 24:48.986
<i>being an undertaker
and everything.</i>

24:49.027 --> 24:51.120
<i>It's not that
I work with the deceased...</i>

24:51.162 --> 24:53.630
or anything like that,
personally.

24:53.664 --> 24:56.497
<i>It's just... the job.</i>

24:56.533 --> 24:59.161
You get accustomed
to the sight of bodies.

25:02.038 --> 25:04.029
What I mean is...

25:09.378 --> 25:12.074
Looking at bodies ain't so bad.

25:12.113 --> 25:14.081
<i>That's not what
I'm trying to say, either.</i>

25:14.115 --> 25:15.673
<i>What I'm trying to say...</i>

25:16.951 --> 25:18.350
is...

25:20.921 --> 25:23.185
You probably
ain't never seen a body.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.985
Mm-mm.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.460
Oh, they ain't so bad.

25:30.830 --> 25:35.790
Actually, it's
a very exciting line of work.

25:52.599 --> 25:54.590
Police! Get the hell
out of the way, suckers!

25:54.635 --> 25:55.897
Don't make me kill nobody!

25:55.936 --> 25:58.564
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

25:58.605 --> 26:00.334
Goldy, my boy.

26:00.373 --> 26:03.240
What's a nice guy like you
doing in a place like this?

26:03.276 --> 26:06.268
I live here, Grave Digger.
Now get the fuck out!

26:06.311 --> 26:08.404
<i>Two sluts cut up
a white cop last night.</i>

26:08.446 --> 26:09.606
So what? What?

26:09.648 --> 26:11.309
So the word is,
they come outta here.

26:11.349 --> 26:12.611
You wouldn't
know nothing about that?

26:12.651 --> 26:14.346
I don't know
nothing about nothing.

26:14.385 --> 26:16.080
I suppose you don't know
nothing about some boys...

26:16.120 --> 26:18.315
in Mississippi that shot up
a bunch of white folks...

26:18.355 --> 26:20.653
and stole a trunk of gold?

26:21.658 --> 26:23.592
What's that got to do with me?

26:23.626 --> 26:25.116
Sooner or later,
it'll end up in Harlem.

26:25.161 --> 26:26.890
Between you and Easy Money...

26:26.930 --> 26:28.591
knowing everything
that comes in and out of here...

26:28.630 --> 26:30.359
Gentlemen, you wouldn't
happen to have...

26:30.399 --> 26:32.424
a search warrant, would you?

26:34.335 --> 26:36.826
We don't need
a goddamn search warrant.

26:36.871 --> 26:38.998
OK! All right!

26:39.040 --> 26:40.803
We said we don't know
nothing about nothing.

26:40.842 --> 26:42.309
Yeah!

26:43.877 --> 26:46.107
You better watch
your ass, fruitcake.

26:46.146 --> 26:50.480
Or we'll shut
this motherfucker down!

26:53.285 --> 26:54.775
Let's go.

26:58.590 --> 26:59.818
Someday, though.

26:59.858 --> 27:04.227
Yeah, someday...
I'm gonna kick your ass.

27:04.261 --> 27:07.992
<i>Try not to break
anything on the way out.</i>

27:08.031 --> 27:09.362
Bastards.

27:09.398 --> 27:12.526
Could've been worse.
Ha ha! OK, girls.

27:12.568 --> 27:15.036
The fun is over.
Let's clean up this mess.

27:15.071 --> 27:16.971
Come on, come on!

27:17.005 --> 27:19.838
Did you hear what they said?
There's gold in Harlem!

27:19.875 --> 27:21.740
Don't even think about it.

27:21.776 --> 27:23.937
Shit, Kathy,
this could be it for me.

27:23.978 --> 27:27.709
I get my hands on that gold...

27:27.748 --> 27:29.978
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.506
I'll be careful.

27:31.551 --> 27:33.143
Yes! I'll be careful!

27:33.186 --> 27:35.552
<i>Ladies!
I'm coming back, ladies!</i>

27:35.588 --> 27:37.215
<i>Hey! I done told you...</i>

27:37.256 --> 27:39.486
<i>a million times to keep
your behind off my stoop!</i>

27:45.229 --> 27:48.630
What you doing?

27:48.666 --> 27:50.998
Staring at you.

27:52.168 --> 27:55.160
You've been there all night,
haven't you?

28:01.176 --> 28:03.144
You covered me up?

28:03.178 --> 28:05.043
<i>Yeah, it gets
so cold around here...</i>

28:05.079 --> 28:08.310
<i>I didn't want you
to get sick or nothing.</i>

28:08.349 --> 28:11.944
It's just that most men
would've uncovered me.

28:11.985 --> 28:13.612
All of 'em, in fact.

28:13.654 --> 28:17.784
What kind of man would do
something like that to you?

28:17.824 --> 28:20.384
<i>That's not very nice.</i>

28:20.426 --> 28:23.520
Where you staying, anyway?

28:24.931 --> 28:27.491
<i>Do you have family around here?</i>

28:30.335 --> 28:33.463
I sure had a fine time
last night, Jackson.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.096
Me, too.

28:35.139 --> 28:38.973
Thank you...
for covering me up and all.

28:40.443 --> 28:43.037
Rubbing my feet and all.

28:43.079 --> 28:45.707
Oh, it's no problem.

28:45.748 --> 28:47.943
Really, it's no problem.

29:09.268 --> 29:11.429
You a virgin, Jackson?

29:11.470 --> 29:14.803
What you want to ask me
a question like that for?

29:14.839 --> 29:17.000
I'll take that as a yes.

29:18.576 --> 29:20.134
I ain't no virgin.

29:20.178 --> 29:23.045
Heh.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.775
I could teach you.

29:24.815 --> 29:26.646
I don't know.

29:26.683 --> 29:30.813
You already taught me to dance
and all that stuff.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.381
Wow.

29:50.169 --> 29:51.864
<i>Come here, baby.</i>

29:59.077 --> 30:00.669
Turn around.

30:04.682 --> 30:09.051
Oh. That's OK.
I can do that.

30:25.566 --> 30:27.227
Lay down, baby.

30:32.406 --> 30:33.737
- Up here.
- Oh.

30:39.178 --> 30:44.241
Do you mind if I take
these pictures off the wall?

30:53.057 --> 30:55.617
- OK.
- OK.

31:10.806 --> 31:14.833
Mm. What you trying
to do, baby?

31:18.979 --> 31:23.712
I'm just... just...
taking my shoes off.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.519
I'm sorry.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.484
I'm so stupid. I don't...

31:35.526 --> 31:39.189
I don't know how to do nothing.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.993
Jackson.

31:48.004 --> 31:49.995
It don't matter.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.431
It really don't matter.

31:56.144 --> 32:00.808
It don't? Really?

32:00.849 --> 32:05.013
Mm-mm. No.

32:06.420 --> 32:11.016
<i>? Please, please,
please, please ?</i>

32:11.057 --> 32:13.184
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

32:13.226 --> 32:17.356
<i>? Please, please, please ?</i>

32:17.395 --> 32:20.694
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

32:20.732 --> 32:22.632
<i>? Honey, please ?</i>

32:22.667 --> 32:24.430
<i>? Don't ?</i>

32:24.468 --> 32:26.095
<i>? Ohh ?</i>

32:26.137 --> 32:27.729
<i>? Oh, yeah ?</i>

32:27.771 --> 32:30.672
<i>? Whoa, I love you so ?</i>

32:30.707 --> 32:33.835
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

32:33.877 --> 32:37.244
<i>? Baby, you did me wrong ?</i>

32:37.279 --> 32:39.679
<i>? You know you done me wrong ?</i>

32:39.715 --> 32:41.842
<i>? Whoa, whoa ?</i>

32:41.884 --> 32:43.647
<i>? You done me wrong ?</i>

32:43.685 --> 32:46.779
<i>? You know you done me wrong ?</i>

32:46.821 --> 32:50.518
<i>? You know you done,
done me wrong ?</i>

32:50.558 --> 32:51.991
<i>? Whoa ?</i>

32:52.025 --> 32:53.617
<i>? Oh, yeah ?</i>

32:53.660 --> 32:56.720
<i>? Took my love,
and now you're gone ?</i>

32:56.763 --> 32:58.958
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

32:58.998 --> 33:00.590
<i>? Please ?</i>

33:00.633 --> 33:03.830
<i>? Please, please, please ?</i>

33:03.869 --> 33:06.770
<i>? Please, please ?</i>

33:06.804 --> 33:08.294
<i>? Please ?</i>

33:08.339 --> 33:10.102
<i>? Please ?</i>

33:11.476 --> 33:14.104
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

33:14.144 --> 33:15.975
Mmm.

33:16.013 --> 33:18.982
Will you marry me?

33:19.016 --> 33:22.247
Marry me. Marry me.

33:22.285 --> 33:25.083
Jackson...

33:25.121 --> 33:27.248
don't you think that's
rushing things a little bit?

33:27.289 --> 33:29.257
I mean...

33:29.291 --> 33:31.851
Maybe we should just
try this out, you know?

33:31.893 --> 33:35.886
Like for the weekend, huh?

33:35.930 --> 33:37.192
Huh?

33:39.300 --> 33:43.202
You mean, live together in sin?

33:43.236 --> 33:46.535
Yeah. Why not? Hmm?

33:48.393 --> 33:50.623
One, two... Uhh!!

33:50.662 --> 33:53.654
Jackson, your decision
to liberate your hair from...

33:53.699 --> 33:56.293
the influence of the white devil
is most encouraging.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.064
Does that mean you're going
to liberate your mind as well?

33:59.103 --> 34:01.537
No. It just means I'm going
to wear my hair natural now.

34:01.571 --> 34:04.472
Woman sure has changed
you a lot in one week.

34:04.507 --> 34:06.441
Morning, Mrs. Canfield.

34:06.476 --> 34:08.137
This trunk is so heavy!

34:08.177 --> 34:09.804
Stop complaining, Jackson.

34:09.844 --> 34:11.641
If you knew anything
about women...

34:11.679 --> 34:13.773
you'd know
you was getting off light.

34:13.815 --> 34:17.013
- Hi, Mrs. Canfield.
- Huh!

34:17.051 --> 34:18.780
I-I don't want
to complain or nothing...

34:18.820 --> 34:20.788
Last night, you trying
to act like Samson.

34:20.822 --> 34:23.757
Now I give you a chance to
prove it, and look how you act.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.121
My good brother,
can you make it from here?

34:26.159 --> 34:29.185
For I must prepare for mass.
As salaam alaikum.

34:29.228 --> 34:33.096
Hey! I told you to just
say good-bye to me.

34:33.132 --> 34:34.565
Just say good-bye.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.329
It was awful nice
of him to help.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.802
What kind of last name is "X"?

34:38.837 --> 34:42.329
Oh, God, you're so innocent.
Ha ha ha!

34:42.373 --> 34:44.069
It just fills my head with joy.

34:44.108 --> 34:46.507
It's refreshing,
that's what it is.

34:46.543 --> 34:51.036
His last name ain't
His last name is Taylor.

34:52.581 --> 34:56.313
- Claude Taylor...
- Maybe that's why he changed it.

35:02.824 --> 35:07.227
Oh... oh, baby!
They cut your throat!

35:07.261 --> 35:12.289
And the trunk busted, and your
blood was all over the gold!

35:14.034 --> 35:16.332
What gold?

35:18.537 --> 35:21.836
It was just a dream.

35:24.109 --> 35:26.236
I been wanting
to give you something.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.738
Belonged to my mother.

35:31.783 --> 35:35.275
And I figure,
if you wear this...

35:35.318 --> 35:38.446
it'll chase all of them
bad dreams away.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.547
Ohh...

35:44.093 --> 35:46.960
I can't take it.

35:46.995 --> 35:48.929
It's yours.

36:05.478 --> 36:09.312
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

36:09.347 --> 36:14.341
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

36:14.385 --> 36:16.546
<i>? Woke me up this morning ?</i>

36:16.587 --> 36:18.054
<i>? Got me on my way ?</i>

36:18.089 --> 36:22.719
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

36:22.759 --> 36:24.283
Hallelujah!

36:25.462 --> 36:27.953
<i>? Praise God on high ?</i>

36:27.996 --> 36:31.227
<i>? It was a hot day
in Harlem, New York City ?</i>

36:31.266 --> 36:32.631
<i>? City ?</i>

36:32.668 --> 36:35.501
<i>? When Cain
went into the fields ?</i>

36:35.536 --> 36:37.163
<i>? With his brother Abel ?</i>

36:37.205 --> 36:38.729
<i>? Abel ?</i>

36:38.773 --> 36:40.263
<i>? All right, and while Abel ?</i>

36:40.308 --> 36:42.003
<i>? I said, while Abel ?</i>

36:42.042 --> 36:44.704
<i>? Was tilling the soil ?</i>

36:44.744 --> 36:46.507
<i>? Cain rose up ?</i>

36:46.546 --> 36:49.037
<i>? He rose up
against his brother ?</i>

36:49.081 --> 36:50.275
<i>? Oh, yes, he did ?</i>

36:50.316 --> 36:52.546
<i>? He picked up that rock ?</i>

36:52.585 --> 36:54.883
<i>? It was not
the rock of Jesus ?</i>

36:54.920 --> 36:56.251
<i>? Jesus ?</i>

36:56.287 --> 36:58.551
<i>? It was the rock of jealousy ?</i>

36:58.590 --> 37:02.458
<i>? And Cain,
Cain took that rock ?</i>

37:02.494 --> 37:03.620
<i>? He took that rock... ?</i>

37:28.983 --> 37:31.315
<i>? Praise God, praise God ?</i>

37:31.351 --> 37:34.320
<i>? Praise God, praise God ?</i>

37:42.327 --> 37:43.885
Have a blessed week now.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.453
God bless you now.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.191
Have a blessed week.

37:47.231 --> 37:49.165
- Jackson!
- Reverend Gaines...

37:49.200 --> 37:52.761
I'd like to introduce you
to Sister Imabelle...

37:52.802 --> 37:54.667
a good, decent,
God-fearing woman.

37:54.704 --> 37:56.672
Well, God bless your head,
my sister.

37:56.706 --> 37:59.834
Now, Jackson, I hope you took
my sermon to head.

37:59.875 --> 38:01.342
You still ain't talking
to your stepbrother?

38:01.377 --> 38:02.469
No.

38:02.511 --> 38:03.876
<i>Forget your differences,
Jackson.</i>

38:03.913 --> 38:05.710
<i>Life is too short
for all of this pettiness.</i>

38:05.747 --> 38:07.908
- Yes, sir.
- Now, remember, Jackson...

38:07.949 --> 38:10.179
you promised to look over
the church accounts.

38:10.218 --> 38:13.016
- Um, we'll be right back.
- All right.

38:13.053 --> 38:16.386
You just go on home.
I'll be there shortly, OK?

38:16.423 --> 38:18.584
- OK.
- Bye.

38:20.393 --> 38:21.758
Yes, sir!

38:38.042 --> 38:42.069
What's the matter, baby?
Ain't you glad to see me?

38:42.111 --> 38:46.741
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

38:46.783 --> 38:49.479
I thought you was dead.
When I saw you at church...

38:49.518 --> 38:51.884
I was so happy to see you,
I just wanted to cry.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.751
I come over here
as quickly as I could...

38:53.789 --> 38:55.654
just hoping you'd be here.

38:55.690 --> 38:58.784
Oh, baby, here you are.

38:58.826 --> 39:02.159
I think she's sweet on this lame
she's shacked up with.

39:02.195 --> 39:05.596
And I think you don't know what
the fuck you talking about!

39:05.632 --> 39:08.567
I needed some place to lay low,
so fuck you!

39:08.601 --> 39:11.729
- No, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

39:11.770 --> 39:14.671
- No, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

39:14.707 --> 39:16.231
Oh, man, this is bullshit!

39:16.274 --> 39:18.265
She and him was gonna
cut and run with the gold!

39:18.309 --> 39:20.402
She come back to get the trunk!

39:20.445 --> 39:22.413
Now, Slim...

39:23.947 --> 39:26.108
would I go
for a chump like him...

39:26.149 --> 39:27.810
after I been with
a man like you?

39:27.851 --> 39:31.947
An undertaker? Ha ha ha!

39:38.159 --> 39:40.650
Jodie, you don't know
what you're talking about.

39:40.695 --> 39:43.186
This here's my Imabelle.

39:43.231 --> 39:46.257
This our Imabelle.

39:48.702 --> 39:56.473
Besides, all Imabelle done
is to set up our first city boy.

39:56.509 --> 39:58.500
Mm-hmm.

40:02.948 --> 40:04.677
You want to scam Jackson?

40:04.715 --> 40:07.912
Well, the boy look like
a born sucker to me.

40:07.952 --> 40:12.446
We gonna take him
for everything he got, or...

40:13.623 --> 40:16.854
Pop go the weasel.

40:16.893 --> 40:21.921
OK, baby, what you want to do?

40:21.964 --> 40:24.797
<i>I think we ought
to bake some money.</i>

40:24.833 --> 40:26.323
<i>That'll be perfect.</i>

40:26.367 --> 40:29.803
Say, baby girl,
who's that on the wall?

40:29.837 --> 40:34.001
Why, that's Jesus.

40:34.041 --> 40:36.703
I know who the fuck Jesus is.

40:36.743 --> 40:39.268
I'm talking about
the other dude.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.008
That's his mama.

40:42.381 --> 40:44.178
That's Jesus's mama?

40:44.216 --> 40:46.514
Jackson's mama, fool!

40:50.488 --> 40:51.614
His mama?

40:58.495 --> 41:00.861
That is one ugly bitch!

41:00.897 --> 41:02.660
Ha ha ha!

41:02.699 --> 41:05.691
Jodie, she got a gorilla
in her past.

41:05.735 --> 41:07.498
Ha ha ha! And just think...

41:07.536 --> 41:11.302
if you and Jackson
were to make babies...

41:11.340 --> 41:13.399
Ha ha ha ha!

41:14.642 --> 41:16.371
Y'all wait in the car.

41:16.410 --> 41:18.537
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

41:20.448 --> 41:22.643
<i>Oh, baby girl...</i>

41:26.152 --> 41:27.915
Now, let me take a look at you.

41:27.954 --> 41:31.720
Come on, let me take
a good look at you.

41:31.757 --> 41:36.126
Mm-hmm. Now you take off
that jacket.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.594
Sure miss looking at you.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.927
Mm-hmm.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.401
Mmm mmm mmm!

41:48.472 --> 41:50.838
Come here, baby.

41:52.341 --> 41:55.504
- Come here.
- Ha ha ha!

41:56.978 --> 41:58.343
<i>Um!</i>

41:59.848 --> 42:02.214
You stretching
this boy's jeans?

42:02.250 --> 42:07.051
What, baby?
That sucker?

42:07.087 --> 42:11.387
Well, he be a dead sucker
if he don't profit me.

42:11.424 --> 42:13.722
You understand?

42:24.301 --> 42:26.132
<i>Babe, I don't know about this.</i>

42:26.133 --> 42:28.294
Sounds like a hoax to me.

42:28.458 --> 42:31.985
Baby, it ain't no hoax.

42:36.665 --> 42:38.997
I have something for you.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.970
Hmm?

42:58.283 --> 43:01.480
Oh, God.

43:01.519 --> 43:03.851
You're gonna look fine
when you take me out...

43:03.888 --> 43:06.322
with all that money
we gonna make.

43:07.390 --> 43:09.017
Where'd you get it?

43:10.660 --> 43:13.788
Did you sell
your grandmother's ring?

43:15.998 --> 43:17.295
Oh, God.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.392
What's wrong, baby?

43:19.435 --> 43:23.531
I think you're the answer
to all my prayers.

43:23.571 --> 43:26.938
<i>You're every dream
I ever had come true.</i>

43:26.975 --> 43:29.341
Jackson...

43:29.376 --> 43:31.844
What? What?

43:31.879 --> 43:37.374
I never meant you no harm.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.512
<i>That's right.</i>

43:43.555 --> 43:46.353
<i>This is
my life savings... $1,500.</i>

43:46.391 --> 43:49.087
And you want me to raise it
to 15 Gs, right?

43:49.126 --> 43:50.252
Right.

43:54.932 --> 43:57.628
Uh, are you gonna
change mine, too?

43:57.667 --> 44:00.830
He did it for me last week.
It's a miracle. A miracle!

44:00.870 --> 44:03.430
- Really?
- Mm-hmm! This man's a genius!

44:03.472 --> 44:07.033
He's gonna make us rich.
We gonna be rich, god damn it!

44:15.249 --> 44:20.277
Now, I'm gonna have me
some water while it's baking.

44:22.322 --> 44:25.257
Uh, yeah.
Let me get some of that.

44:25.291 --> 44:29.694
Why don't you sit down, daddy?
Your knees are shaking.

44:29.728 --> 44:31.787
Thank you.

44:31.830 --> 44:34.060
You know, if this works,
we can take the 15,000...

44:34.098 --> 44:36.931
turn it into 150,000. 150,000,
turn it into 1.5 million.

44:36.967 --> 44:39.128
<i>1.5 million
into 150 million...</i>

44:39.169 --> 44:41.137
<i>150 million
into 1.5 billion dollars.</i>

44:41.171 --> 44:43.036
We'll be rich.
We'll be really rich!

44:44.073 --> 44:45.438
- Oh!
- Look out, honey!

44:45.474 --> 44:48.534
Open in the name of the law!
I'm a United States marshal...

44:48.578 --> 44:51.240
and I'll shoot the first
son of a bitch that moves!

44:51.279 --> 44:53.270
- Aah!
- Run, daddy, run!

44:53.315 --> 44:54.441
Don't you move, boy!

44:54.482 --> 44:57.280
I don't want to have to put
a bullet in your ass!

44:57.319 --> 45:00.220
I ain't moving!
I ain't moving! Look!

45:00.254 --> 45:02.950
Man, put your hands down.
This ain't no goddamn movie.

45:02.990 --> 45:07.450
Now, you stand up here and take
your punishment like a man.

45:07.493 --> 45:10.394
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

45:10.430 --> 45:13.490
What, your woman
put you up to this?

45:13.532 --> 45:16.501
Oh, no.
She's a law-abiding woman.

45:16.535 --> 45:18.969
She ain't mine, neither.
No, no.

45:20.605 --> 45:23.301
I don't want to be rude
or nothing...

45:23.341 --> 45:27.209
but would it be OK...
if I gave you $20G...

45:27.244 --> 45:29.735
would you let me go?

45:29.779 --> 45:32.407
<i>Oh, Lord, ashes to ashes
and dusk to dusk.</i>

45:32.449 --> 45:36.146
All he left me was his debts.

45:36.185 --> 45:38.653
It's OK,
my little chocolate bunny.

45:38.687 --> 45:41.485
You see,
we're better off without him.

45:41.522 --> 45:46.255
See, y-your husband's
in a better place, and so am I.

45:47.694 --> 45:49.423
Please forgive me.

45:50.564 --> 45:52.429
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

46:07.479 --> 46:10.039
Mmm! That you, Louis?

46:10.080 --> 46:13.675
No, sir. It's me, Jackson.

46:13.717 --> 46:15.810
I thought you took
the afternoon off.

46:15.852 --> 46:17.046
Yes, sir.

46:17.086 --> 46:19.714
But there were some numbers
that didn't add up...

46:19.756 --> 46:22.122
and I thought they might
have overcharged us...

46:22.157 --> 46:24.125
on that embalming fluid.

46:24.159 --> 46:28.289
I ain't gonna give you no raise,
son, so don't overdo it.

46:28.330 --> 46:30.298
Yes, sir.

46:32.366 --> 46:36.632
<i>I'll sop you like a biscuit
on some gravy.</i>

46:36.670 --> 46:39.639
Just think of me as smooth
as a piece of okra.

46:43.409 --> 46:46.139
I'd suck you like a neck bone.

46:50.581 --> 46:51.912
Here's the money.

46:56.753 --> 47:00.348
You stay away from that woman.

47:03.393 --> 47:05.486
Please...

47:05.528 --> 47:06.825
Uhh!

47:12.901 --> 47:15.131
You're lucky.

47:16.771 --> 47:21.538
I don't want
to see you no more.

47:55.242 --> 47:56.732
Imabelle?

48:15.626 --> 48:18.686
Don't let her be gone, God.

48:18.729 --> 48:21.129
Don't let her be gone.
Don't let her be gone.

48:29.605 --> 48:31.630
She took the cross!

48:33.575 --> 48:36.408
Sure took your time
getting here.

48:36.444 --> 48:38.002
We do the best we can, ma'am.

48:38.045 --> 48:40.138
<i>Now, this is his room.</i>

48:40.181 --> 48:43.014
<i>And this is him.</i>

48:44.184 --> 48:46.652
Don't surprise me none.

48:46.686 --> 48:50.588
I don't know why old man Clay
trusted him in the first place.

48:50.623 --> 48:51.988
You said he had
a woman up here.

48:52.024 --> 48:54.549
Some southern gal.
She's a thief, too.

48:54.593 --> 48:57.824
Oh! Evil, evil woman!

48:57.862 --> 48:59.830
The same detectives
what arrested Jackson...

48:59.864 --> 49:02.628
came back with two more
and arrested her.

49:02.666 --> 49:04.634
Said they wasn't
no regular detectives...

49:04.668 --> 49:07.136
said they was
some special agents.

49:07.170 --> 49:09.263
And they took her trunk
as evidence.

49:09.306 --> 49:11.774
- Oh, yeah? What was in it?
- I don't know.

49:11.807 --> 49:14.640
Whatever it was, it certainly
must have been important...

49:14.677 --> 49:16.201
the way they was carrying on.

49:16.245 --> 49:18.679
<i>Those could be the Mississippi
boys we been looking for.</i>

49:18.713 --> 49:21.910
<i>Yeah! The ones
with the trunk of gold!</i>

49:21.950 --> 49:24.612
<i>Maybe the gal's
trunk was full of her panties.</i>

49:24.652 --> 49:25.778
Gold!

49:25.819 --> 49:27.548
- Maybe it wasn't.
- Maybe it wasn't.

49:27.588 --> 49:30.056
Well, maybe it was,
and maybe it wasn't.

49:30.090 --> 49:34.823
But somebody don't come up
with my $175.95 for my stove...

49:34.861 --> 49:36.954
I'm gonna raise some hell,
you hear me?

49:36.996 --> 49:38.691
I'm really gonna raise hell!

49:38.730 --> 49:40.027
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

49:40.065 --> 49:42.090
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Jesus.

49:42.134 --> 49:44.102
I know that's Jesus.
I mean the other guy.

49:44.136 --> 49:45.535
That's his mama.

49:45.570 --> 49:48.300
- Jesus!
- God damn!

49:48.339 --> 49:50.432
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

49:50.474 --> 49:54.001
<i>Y'all welcome.</i>

49:55.645 --> 49:58.205
Wake up, my brothers and
sisters, for the time has come!

49:58.248 --> 49:59.715
For we do not wish
amalgamating...

49:59.748 --> 50:01.739
with the pale-skinned nation
of the Europeans.

50:01.784 --> 50:03.411
Blacks should quit bothering
with his religion!

50:03.452 --> 50:05.386
Quit bothering with hot combs
and skin-bleaching!

50:05.420 --> 50:06.910
Man is made of haste,
my brother!

50:06.955 --> 50:10.322
I ask you to let me
show you my portion!

50:10.358 --> 50:13.657
I haven't got time for you
right now, Claude X.

50:13.694 --> 50:17.289
Listen, you just slow down.
I'm gonna tell you something.

50:17.331 --> 50:19.765
You're looking for your woman.

50:19.799 --> 50:21.494
She's nowhere to be found.

50:21.534 --> 50:24.560
I saw her leaving
with some serious black devils.

50:24.604 --> 50:26.595
Now, it may do you well
to seek a brother's help.

50:26.638 --> 50:28.697
You talking about
my stepbrother?

50:28.740 --> 50:31.675
Uh-uh. We ain't been talking
for five years.

50:31.710 --> 50:33.302
Well, you better sta? now.

50:33.344 --> 50:36.142
I don't want
to talk to my brother.

50:36.180 --> 50:38.512
I wanna talk to Reverend Gaines.
He'll know what I should do.

50:38.549 --> 50:41.313
If you want to find God,
you talk to a preacher.

50:41.351 --> 50:45.185
If you want to find devils,
you talk to a demon.

50:48.290 --> 50:50.281
These will take
your uncle Inell...

50:50.325 --> 50:52.259
straight to the bosom
of the Lord.

50:52.294 --> 50:55.752
For I have seen heaven open
and beheld the white horse.

50:55.796 --> 50:58.264
That'll be $5.00.

50:58.299 --> 50:59.789
I told you...

50:59.834 --> 51:03.565
No, no. There he his.

51:03.603 --> 51:06.299
Oh, my God!

51:06.339 --> 51:07.966
Brother Gabriel's
got your ticket.

51:08.008 --> 51:11.307
I can't believe my own brother's
out here on the street corner...

51:11.343 --> 51:14.870
impersonating a man of God!
What are you think...

51:14.913 --> 51:17.473
Don't call me Sherman in public,
you hear what I'm saying?

51:17.515 --> 51:18.948
That's your Christian name.

51:18.983 --> 51:19.972
Claude X, why you bring
this square around here?

51:20.018 --> 51:21.451
Brothers, brothers.

51:21.486 --> 51:23.716
<i>Goldy, your brother
needs your help.</i>

51:23.754 --> 51:25.813
<i>He has been robbed
of his woman...</i>

51:25.856 --> 51:28.450
and the Prophet says
lower thy wings in kindness...

51:28.492 --> 51:31.825
- to thy tribe of near-kin.
- Tribe, my ass!

51:31.861 --> 51:33.488
Just because...

51:33.529 --> 51:35.224
What's the daily word,
Reverend?

51:35.264 --> 51:37.459
And the Savior said
to his disciples...

51:37.499 --> 51:41.902
said, "He that loveth
his brother more than me...

51:41.936 --> 51:43.904
"is not worthy of me."

51:43.937 --> 51:46.303
The man is a demon.

51:46.340 --> 51:47.830
- What?
- Run.

51:47.875 --> 51:50.742
- That's not true.
- Run away from him!

51:50.777 --> 51:53.803
- Blind man...
- I don't need no bean pie!

51:53.846 --> 51:55.575
What you need
is a divine message!

51:55.615 --> 51:58.516
Awaken, my people!
The so-called Negroes...

51:58.550 --> 51:59.847
So, what happened, bros?

51:59.885 --> 52:02.251
That gold-digger you met at
the Royale take all your money?

52:02.287 --> 52:03.845
She didn't have
nothing to do with it.

52:03.889 --> 52:05.982
Just 'cause the only kind
of woman you associate with...

52:06.023 --> 52:08.491
is prostitutes and lowlifes-
Put that back!

52:08.526 --> 52:11.051
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Put that back!

52:11.094 --> 52:13.289
Just because you abandoned
me and Mama...

52:13.329 --> 52:16.457
and then broke her head
with all your evil ways...

52:16.499 --> 52:19.468
don't mean that everybody
in the world is just like you!

52:19.501 --> 52:20.866
Come here talking
that holier-than-thou shit...

52:20.903 --> 52:23.371
looking for me to help you?
Fuck you, man!

52:23.405 --> 52:27.501
You ain't said five decent words
to me in five years...

52:27.542 --> 52:29.772
and now just 'cause
you need something...

52:29.811 --> 52:32.405
That's right! I need you to
help me find my woman, Sherman!

52:32.446 --> 52:34.607
- I need your help!
- Help yourself, man!

52:34.648 --> 52:36.275
Here-here's some tickets
to heaven.

52:36.316 --> 52:37.749
<i>Move your preaching ass!</i>

52:37.784 --> 52:40.582
You want to run me down?
A man of the cloth?

52:40.619 --> 52:42.610
<i>Com flake-eating motherfucker!
Get out of the way!</i>

52:42.655 --> 52:43.917
Help me, Sherman!
You're my brother!

52:43.956 --> 52:45.116
- Forget it!
- We're blood!

52:45.157 --> 52:47.352
- No!
- There's gold.

52:47.392 --> 52:50.293
There's a trunk full of gold.

52:50.328 --> 52:53.456
Gold.

52:53.497 --> 52:57.194
You say there's a trunk
full of gold?

52:57.234 --> 52:59.134
You ain't never gonna change.

52:59.169 --> 53:01.160
No. I ain't never gonna change.

53:01.204 --> 53:03.195
Come here for a second. Shit.

53:03.239 --> 53:05.230
And then they put
the money in the stove...

53:05.274 --> 53:07.834
And the stove blew up,
and the marshal ran in...

53:07.876 --> 53:10.003
- and blip blop de blam.
- How you know that?

53:10.045 --> 53:12.275
My very own brother
taken in by the bluff.

53:12.314 --> 53:14.339
But there was a hundred dollars
came outta that stove.

53:14.381 --> 53:17.179
What's the matter with you?
Where's your fucking brain, huh?

53:17.218 --> 53:19.652
You been drinking
embalming fluid or some shit?

53:19.687 --> 53:20.915
You been suckered...

53:20.954 --> 53:23.252
and your gal run off with
the stud that took your money.

53:23.289 --> 53:25.416
She didn't run off.
They took her, Sherman!

53:25.458 --> 53:27.585
She's in trouble, too.
I know. I can feel her.

53:27.627 --> 53:30.255
She's in trouble?
You the one's in trouble...

53:30.295 --> 53:31.922
Mr. Churchgoing Man.

53:31.964 --> 53:35.263
Heh heh. Shit,
you just robbed your own boss.

53:35.299 --> 53:38.063
You motherfuckers
got a cigarette?

53:38.102 --> 53:39.729
No, we ain't got no cigarette.

53:39.771 --> 53:43.832
Listen, I'll help you
get your woman back.

53:43.874 --> 53:46.342
First, we call Kathy,
then we go see Blind.

53:46.376 --> 53:48.105
But I keep the gold,
you understand?

53:48.145 --> 53:49.840
You get the woman,
I get the gold.

53:49.879 --> 53:52.211
Woman, gold. Strictly business.

53:52.248 --> 53:53.647
- Got it?
- Got it.

53:53.682 --> 53:54.671
All right.

53:54.717 --> 53:56.810
You motherfuckers is in my way!

53:56.851 --> 53:58.819
Give me your money...

53:58.853 --> 54:01.651
and don't think
I wouldn't cut you, Reverend!

54:01.689 --> 54:03.156
Have mercy, son.

54:04.892 --> 54:06.757
You lucky I got
my reverend shit on...

54:06.794 --> 54:08.489
otherwise I'd blow
your fucking lips off.

54:08.529 --> 54:10.997
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm going!

54:11.030 --> 54:14.022
I can't believe that. Man tried
to stick up a preacher!

54:14.066 --> 54:16.034
So we got a deal, bros?

54:16.068 --> 54:18.127
I just want
to get her back, Sherman.

54:18.170 --> 54:19.831
I don't care nothing
about no gold.

54:19.871 --> 54:22.032
Come with me, chump.

54:22.073 --> 54:24.564
And stop calling me Sherman.

54:24.608 --> 54:27.372
- Where you taking me, Sherman?
- Shh!

54:34.717 --> 54:36.947
Will Kill, what you been doing?

54:36.986 --> 54:38.749
Not a goddamn thing.

54:38.787 --> 54:42.723
- Blind Man here?
- He's back there.

54:45.259 --> 54:46.954
Shit.

54:46.994 --> 54:48.928
<i>That's him!
Coming to get it!</i>

54:48.963 --> 54:51.955
Sherman! There are
half-dressed women in here.

54:51.998 --> 54:53.693
You know my stepbrother?

54:53.733 --> 54:55.667
<i>I'm Jackson.</i>

54:55.702 --> 54:58.136
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:58.171 --> 55:00.162
Jackson, uh...

55:00.206 --> 55:02.868
why don't you check out
the crap table?

55:02.908 --> 55:05.809
Go ahead. Good.

55:05.844 --> 55:07.311
Stepbrother?

55:07.345 --> 55:11.748
Yeah. Listen,
I need some information.

55:20.679 --> 55:24.706
It's that Jackson, ain't it?

55:24.750 --> 55:26.274
You're jerking that lame.

55:26.318 --> 55:30.277
Oh, come on, baby.
What you talking about?

55:30.321 --> 55:33.984
What is it?
You got religion, baby?

55:34.024 --> 55:39.257
Huh? Is that what it is?

55:39.295 --> 55:41.923
Or is there something wrong?

55:46.902 --> 55:47.926
do this tonight.

55:47.969 --> 55:49.903
I want you
to stop treating me...

55:49.937 --> 55:51.734
like I got nothing
to say in this.

55:51.773 --> 55:53.900
Look, I haven't got time
to explain everything to you.

55:53.941 --> 55:55.374
Like I said, just trust me.

55:55.409 --> 55:57.104
That's not something
we're used to doing with you.

55:57.144 --> 55:58.702
We? Who's we?

55:58.745 --> 56:01.077
The family! You know,
the people you forgot about?

56:01.114 --> 56:02.877
Oh, get off my back!

56:02.915 --> 56:05.748
You really don't care,
do you? You really don't care!

56:05.785 --> 56:08.015
You didn't even come
to your mama's funeral!

56:08.054 --> 56:11.683
Hey! You don't know what
the fuck you're talking about!

56:11.723 --> 56:13.748
And it ain't none of
your fucking business...

56:13.792 --> 56:15.623
what I did or didn't do!

56:15.659 --> 56:19.186
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me with your gun next?

56:21.365 --> 56:23.162
Just forget it.

56:23.199 --> 56:27.431
Just forget it and stick with
the business deal. All right?

56:27.470 --> 56:29.995
I ain't never gonna own you
as my brother.

56:30.038 --> 56:34.099
And that goes double for me,
man. That's double for me!

56:34.142 --> 56:35.871
You ain't got no feeling.

56:35.911 --> 56:37.572
I got feelings! I got...

56:37.611 --> 56:40.512
Who are you to tell me
I ain't got no feelings?!

56:40.548 --> 56:43.517
I'm a fool for talking to you.
Come on!

56:57.096 --> 56:58.688
Oh!

56:58.730 --> 57:04.066
<i>? And I'm saving all my loving
just for you ?</i>

57:06.103 --> 57:07.263
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

57:22.751 --> 57:24.548
Didn't tell me you were
taking me to a whorehouse.

57:24.586 --> 57:26.213
Shut up, man. Any luck?

57:26.253 --> 57:28.687
Yeah, I think so.

57:28.722 --> 57:29.984
Who's the 'john'?

57:30.023 --> 57:32.617
My name's not John. My name
is Jackson. Thank you, ma'am.

57:32.658 --> 57:35.183
Jackson?
You two are stepbrothers?

57:35.228 --> 57:36.695
<i>You made up or something?</i>

57:36.729 --> 57:39.926
No, no. Just got a little
business deal going, that's all.

57:39.965 --> 57:42.126
<i>I think it ain't like that.</i>

57:42.167 --> 57:44.101
<i>Come on, sit down.
Sit down, Jackson.</i>

57:44.136 --> 57:46.969
I'll stand.
Thank you very much.

57:47.004 --> 57:48.096
Where's he at?

57:48.139 --> 57:52.098
Ah, Teena's got his lap staked.

57:52.143 --> 57:54.134
Here.

57:54.177 --> 57:56.236
<i>Father, lead us not
into temptation...</i>

57:56.279 --> 57:57.803
<i>but deliver us from evil!</i>

57:57.847 --> 58:00.714
<i>- Ooh, is that them?
- Yeah, I think so.</i>

58:05.521 --> 58:07.921
Come on! Come on! Come on!

58:07.955 --> 58:11.152
It just ain't right.
Just ain't right.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.825
I'll handle this!

58:20.600 --> 58:22.124
Excuse me! Excuse me!

58:22.168 --> 58:24.432
- What's that lame doing?
- Oh, shit!

58:24.470 --> 58:27.735
- Shit!
- Wait! I'll get him!

58:27.773 --> 58:29.502
Yeah! Yeah!

58:33.745 --> 58:35.474
Hey, you!

58:36.480 --> 58:37.606
<i>Ooh!</i>

58:57.064 --> 58:59.089
Just throw his ass down there!

58:59.133 --> 59:00.293
That is your brother?

59:00.334 --> 59:02.666
Yes! And you should have
hit him twice!

59:02.703 --> 59:04.000
You should have shot him!

59:04.037 --> 59:06.267
All right!

59:07.373 --> 59:10.308
I gotta go wee-wee.

59:10.342 --> 59:13.539
Ain't you a little old
to be talking that way?

59:13.579 --> 59:17.310
I talk that way,
I stay that way, honey.

59:17.348 --> 59:19.475
I'll be right back.

59:24.254 --> 59:26.779
- Goldy, listen! I got it.
- What?

59:26.823 --> 59:30.418
He's been telling me about this
gold mine he's representing...

59:30.460 --> 59:33.258
and he's been going all over the
United States selling shares.

59:33.295 --> 59:35.456
How do you know
he's not scamming you?

59:35.497 --> 59:38.057
Because he's got two partners,
plus a contact man...

59:38.100 --> 59:40.796
named Gus Parsons
working the Braddock Bar.

59:40.835 --> 59:43.303
And he said he's gonna show me
a trunk full of gold...

59:43.338 --> 59:44.737
that they're using as bait.

59:44.772 --> 59:47.070
But listen. They're pulling out
tomorrow night.

59:47.107 --> 59:49.200
- You did great, baby.
- Thanks.

59:49.243 --> 59:52.076
<i>Keep him talking!</i>

59:52.111 --> 59:53.738
<i>You gotta help me.</i>

59:53.779 --> 59:55.906
<i>Son, you've gotta know
when you've had enough.</i>

59:55.948 --> 59:59.509
I got nothing. This is my chance
to get something.

59:59.551 --> 01:00:02.179
Now, either help me
or I'm gonna do it alone.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.414
Not this time.

01:00:03.455 --> 01:00:04.979
<i>Did you hit me?</i>

01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:06.752
Sherman!

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.692
What are you thinking about,
slugging your own brother?

01:00:10.728 --> 01:00:13.390
I didn't hit you.
But I should've hit you!

01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:14.487
He hit you!

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:15.861
He?

01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:19.660
Oh, God.

01:00:24.825 --> 01:00:26.986
Now, let's just go over this
one more time.

01:00:27.028 --> 01:00:29.189
It's very important.
There are three things...

01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:32.562
I do not want you to do tonight.
One... don't drink.

01:00:32.599 --> 01:00:35.227
Don't drink? Why would I drink?
I don't drink.

01:00:35.267 --> 01:00:37.394
That's your problem. But just
stick with that tonight.

01:00:37.436 --> 01:00:40.269
OK? Two...
don't flash this roll..

01:00:40.306 --> 01:00:42.240
In front of anybody
but Gus parsons.

01:00:42.273 --> 01:00:44.537
- Don't flash this roll.
- Right.

01:00:44.576 --> 01:00:46.806
All right, number thr...

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.812
What is that shit on your face?

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.574
It's my disguise.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:51.774
All right. Three...

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.578
should you meet up
with Gus persons...

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:56.211
and he wants to take you
to the gold, you go by cab.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.549
Go by cab.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.521
Does he always have
to repeat everything?

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.614
Go get him.
I'm right behind you.

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:03.420
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:01:11.532 --> 01:01:12.794
Good evening.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:14.960
Good evening.

01:01:15.002 --> 01:01:16.026
Evening.

01:01:17.604 --> 01:01:19.435
Hello.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.701
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:01:22.742 --> 01:01:24.710
I bet he fucks it up.

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:26.370
I bet he pulls it off.

01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:27.810
$20 he'll miss.

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:29.336
Twenty.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.952
I'll have a glass of milk.

01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:40.456
We don't serve no goddamn milk.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:43.687
No milk. Right.

01:01:43.727 --> 01:01:45.922
Well, how about some water?

01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:47.986
We don't serve
no goddamn water.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.624
No water. Right.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:54.762
Well, you know, I'll just have
whatever you suggest.

01:01:58.472 --> 01:01:59.632
Thank you very much.

01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:11.074
Why is he drinking?

01:02:11.117 --> 01:02:14.314
Ha ha ha!
'Cause you owe me $20.

01:02:14.352 --> 01:02:17.287
What... is this stuff?

01:02:17.322 --> 01:02:18.983
Rye goddamn whiskey.

01:02:19.023 --> 01:02:21.423
It's good. Heh.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:23.824
I can't... I can't believe this.

01:02:23.861 --> 01:02:29.128
Yes, except that's two drinks
at $20... that's $40.

01:02:29.165 --> 01:02:31.998
Thank you, that is
very hospitable of you!

01:02:32.035 --> 01:02:33.969
It ain't goddamn free.

01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:36.899
No, no.

01:02:36.938 --> 01:02:40.169
I meant hospitable in spirit.
I got plenty of money.

01:02:40.207 --> 01:02:41.333
Plenty of money!

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:43.138
<i>Payday.</i>

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:45.702
Out comes the roll.
Out comes the roll.

01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:49.778
What's wrong with you?

01:02:49.816 --> 01:02:51.784
You trying
to get your throat cut?

01:02:51.818 --> 01:02:53.115
You said it ain't free.

01:02:53.153 --> 01:02:55.917
I'm just paying for my drinks,
thank you very much!

01:02:55.954 --> 01:02:57.751
<i>I don't want no trouble.</i>

01:02:57.790 --> 01:02:59.519
<i>You're so unreasonable!</i>

01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:05.127
That's 'cause he knows
you paid him with my money.

01:03:05.163 --> 01:03:07.256
What are you talking about?

01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:08.959
This here's my money.

01:03:08.999 --> 01:03:12.264
I know my money when I see it.
You done picked my pocket.

01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:16.466
- Don't let him scare you, honey.
- Me? Scared? Ha ha.

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:18.166
That will be the day.

01:03:18.207 --> 01:03:20.334
I'll have another rye whiskey.

01:03:20.376 --> 01:03:23.368
Can't nobody tell me
I don't know my own money.

01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:25.140
Now, wait a minute.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.875
What is the difference
between...

01:03:26.915 --> 01:03:28.382
Uhh!

01:03:28.416 --> 01:03:30.748
<i>He's got a gun!</i>

01:03:30.784 --> 01:03:32.649
I don't know how much money
you owe me now.

01:03:32.686 --> 01:03:34.677
You're the punk who robbed me
last night, ain't you?

01:03:34.722 --> 01:03:37.247
I got a good notion
to blow your fucking brains out!

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:38.814
I wouldn't rob you, boss.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.519
Swear for the cross
it wasn't me.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.391
Maybe it was that man
what robbed you.

01:03:42.428 --> 01:03:44.225
'Cause he's sporting
a big roll from somewhere.

01:03:44.262 --> 01:03:46.059
Don't you put that on me.

01:03:46.098 --> 01:03:48.794
I hit the numbers last night.
I can prove that.

01:03:48.834 --> 01:03:50.461
Oh, I know
it wasn't you, friend.

01:03:50.501 --> 01:03:51.729
And maybe it wasn't you,
either...

01:03:51.769 --> 01:03:53.737
but you sure as hell robbed
somebody in your lifetime...

01:03:53.771 --> 01:03:55.411
so you're just getting
what's owed to you!

01:03:55.439 --> 01:03:57.839
Get your ass outta here!

01:03:57.874 --> 01:04:00.502
I was robbed of $700
last night!

01:04:00.543 --> 01:04:01.840
Man tried to hit me.

01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:03.277
But you know something?

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:04.837
That really don't
matter now, friend...

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.110
<i>because I have tucked into
something that's nice...</i>

01:04:07.149 --> 01:04:09.811
<i>something that's solid gold.</i>

01:04:09.852 --> 01:04:11.012
Gold?

01:04:11.052 --> 01:04:13.179
Gus Parsons, real estate.

01:04:13.221 --> 01:04:16.019
Coleman Jackson,
burial services.

01:04:16.057 --> 01:04:18.287
Jackson, huh?
Hey, listen, Jackson.

01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:23.194
How would you like to meet some
very successful businessmen...

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.755
- men just like yourself?
- Like me?

01:04:25.798 --> 01:04:27.459
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go this way.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:30.060
<i>This is the luckiest night
of your life.</i>

01:04:30.102 --> 01:04:31.262
Jackson, come here.

01:04:31.303 --> 01:04:33.464
What is he...

01:04:34.973 --> 01:04:37.100
I gonna have
to blindfold you, friend.

01:04:37.142 --> 01:04:39.770
Blindfold me? For what?

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:44.907
My partners have $100,000 worth
of gold ore in their possession.

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.041
Now, they can't be
taking no chances.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.243
Yeah, but I ain't...

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.775
Hey, Jackson.
I understand completely.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.981
You don't know me
from the man in the moon...

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:55.182
SO...

01:04:55.223 --> 01:04:57.214
I'm gonna give you my gun.

01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:00.784
Thank you very much.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:05.125
Would you lean over, please,
Mr. Jackson?

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:20.401
<i>Get that door, baby girl.</i>

01:05:23.281 --> 01:05:24.771
Mmm.

01:05:37.693 --> 01:05:39.126
There you are.

01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:41.152
What, do y'all know each other?

01:05:44.699 --> 01:05:46.929
I've been in jail two weeks...

01:05:46.968 --> 01:05:50.404
and I ain't seen a woman
in all that time.

01:05:50.437 --> 01:05:52.564
Maybe, uh...

01:05:52.606 --> 01:05:55.632
I just dreamed about you.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.140
First, you... you drain
the blood.

01:06:03.181 --> 01:06:04.808
Ha! And then...

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:07.944
and then you shoot 'em up
with embalming fluid.

01:06:07.986 --> 01:06:09.283
Damn!

01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:13.815
How do you keep their faces
from turning all blue and shit?

01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:14.882
Make-up.

01:06:14.925 --> 01:06:17.325
Jesus.

01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:20.286
<i>Shit!</i>

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.025
Look, whatever you do,
don't lose him.

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.692
This guy's playing whip-ass.

01:06:23.732 --> 01:06:25.700
Since when are you worried
about your brother's ass?

01:06:25.734 --> 01:06:27.702
Since he started shitting gold.

01:06:29.271 --> 01:06:30.329
Hold on!

01:06:38.378 --> 01:06:41.006
<i>- Whoa!
- Get out of the way!</i>

01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:42.378
What's wrong with the street?!

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.714
Ooh! Somebody almost had
an accident or something.

01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:49.243
Yeah, an accident.

01:06:52.023 --> 01:06:53.684
Are we almost there?

01:06:53.725 --> 01:06:55.522
Heh heh heh heh.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.893
Yeah, we're almost there.

01:06:58.929 --> 01:07:00.556
<i>In this dream...</i>

01:07:00.597 --> 01:07:03.498
<i>a woman almost as fine
as her...</i>

01:07:03.534 --> 01:07:06.560
<i>is relaxing on the sofa with...</i>

01:07:06.602 --> 01:07:10.094
trying to interest me
in a box of, uh...

01:07:10.139 --> 01:07:11.401
A box of what?

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.035
Let me see. I think it was...

01:07:15.076 --> 01:07:17.943
candy. Heh heh heh.

01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:22.648
Come over here, baby.

01:07:22.683 --> 01:07:25.083
Come over here. Heh heh heh.

01:07:29.422 --> 01:07:32.016
Ah, don't you love it
when dreams come true?

01:07:33.126 --> 01:07:35.185
Damn, man.

01:07:35.227 --> 01:07:37.195
Slim.

01:07:37.229 --> 01:07:40.460
<i>If your gold is as good
as your taste in women...</i>

01:07:40.498 --> 01:07:41.760
y'all got a deal.

01:07:41.799 --> 01:07:43.391
Did you bring the money?

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.892
It'll be at my place
later tonight.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:51.034
A sweet...
chocolate box of...

01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:52.371
candy.

01:07:52.409 --> 01:07:53.501
Heh heh heh.

01:07:57.112 --> 01:07:58.136
Yeah.

01:08:08.455 --> 01:08:11.083
<i>You know, Jackson,
I really trusted you...</i>

01:08:11.124 --> 01:08:14.093
<i>but you are
a big disappointment to me.</i>

01:08:14.127 --> 01:08:16.652
<i>Disappointment?
What are you talking about?</i>

01:08:21.367 --> 01:08:24.234
Give me the money, Jackson.

01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:26.635
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

01:08:26.671 --> 01:08:28.969
- Ha ha ha!
- Where's Imabelle?

01:08:29.006 --> 01:08:32.100
Oh, so you're the fool.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:35.111
If you don't tell me
where Imabelle is...

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:38.308
I will shoot you dead.

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:39.906
Be my guest.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.645
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:46.111
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.281
The money, Jackson.

01:08:58.531 --> 01:09:00.362
What the fuck is this?

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:03.596
It's play money.
Now, ain't that a dirty trick?

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:06.765
Get your ass outta this car.
Get outta this car!

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:13.011
Now I'm gonna let you hear
what a real gun sounds like.

01:09:13.044 --> 01:09:15.944
'Cause guess what? It's gonna be
the last thing you ever hear.

01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:19.446
Next time you try
to duck somebody...

01:09:19.483 --> 01:09:21.348
take your big-ass foot
off the brake light.

01:09:21.385 --> 01:09:24.013
Look, if you guys are the cops,
I want my lawyer, understand?

01:09:24.054 --> 01:09:26.988
You want a lawyer? Big Kathy,
didn't you used to be a lawyer?

01:09:27.023 --> 01:09:29.389
Ah, shit! You son of a bitch!

01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:31.188
That will be $500.

01:09:31.227 --> 01:09:33.388
Take us where
you take the marks.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:44.134
Ah-ah-ah! Stay in the car.

01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:50.113
- Where are they?
- Top floor.

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:54.710
Hurry up!

01:10:00.122 --> 01:10:02.317
<i>You ever seen such
a sorry-looking bunch...</i>

01:10:02.358 --> 01:10:05.088
<i>of cotton-picking farmers
in your whole life?</i>

01:10:05.127 --> 01:10:06.856
Mmm mmm mmm!

01:10:21.941 --> 01:10:24.273
- Operator.
- Get me the police.

01:10:26.145 --> 01:10:29.444
I can smell it like
biscuits and gravy.

01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:30.778
Heh heh heh.

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:33.045
<i>You ain't gonna eat
no more supper now?</i>

01:10:33.084 --> 01:10:34.642
Yeah.

01:10:34.686 --> 01:10:39.089
<i>It's me... Gus. I brought
investors for the gold mine.</i>

01:10:41.025 --> 01:10:42.788
Go ahead.

01:10:42.825 --> 01:10:44.690
<i>Here we go again.</i>

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:48.225
It's the police, asshole.
Everybody freeze!

01:10:48.264 --> 01:10:49.322
<i>Damn you, Gus!</i>

01:10:49.364 --> 01:10:51.457
Freeze right there and shut up!

01:10:53.535 --> 01:10:54.627
Imabelle.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.404
Hey! It's that thieving undertaker!

01:11:01.442 --> 01:11:04.138
Hey! Come back here! Come here!

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.113
Ooh, lordy, lordy!

01:11:13.152 --> 01:11:14.210
Where are they?

01:11:14.253 --> 01:11:15.618
- Fifth floor!
- Got it!

01:11:15.654 --> 01:11:18.282
- What's the matter?
- My little baby toe!

01:11:18.323 --> 01:11:20.154
Come on, they're getting away!

01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:21.351
Let 'em go!

01:11:21.392 --> 01:11:23.121
Come on!

01:11:23.161 --> 01:11:24.924
I'm gonna kill somebody now!

01:11:26.296 --> 01:11:28.992
What the fuck you looking at?
I'm gonna shoot you first...

01:11:29.032 --> 01:11:31.159
anybody makes a strange move,
you got that?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.259
- Eat shit.
- Shut up!

01:11:33.302 --> 01:11:34.564
<i>All right, come on, now.</i>

01:11:34.604 --> 01:11:36.697
<i>Cooperate,
and we'll go easy on you.</i>

01:11:36.739 --> 01:11:38.366
Coffin Ed and Grave Digger
are here!

01:11:38.406 --> 01:11:39.464
- Mm-mm!
- Jackson!

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:41.304
- Baby!
- Police! Everybody freeze!

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:43.174
- Hank, acid!
- Aah!

01:11:45.379 --> 01:11:47.040
Aaah!

01:11:47.081 --> 01:11:50.642
Jackson! Where are you,
so I can shoot you?

01:11:50.684 --> 01:11:53.050
- Come on!
- Let's go!

01:11:53.086 --> 01:11:54.246
Let's get outta here!

01:11:54.287 --> 01:11:55.276
You all right?

01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:57.653
Jackson, I told you
to wait in the car!

01:11:58.691 --> 01:12:00.352
Back up!

01:12:00.392 --> 01:12:02.383
- Hands up!
- Back up!

01:12:02.427 --> 01:12:04.292
That's right, Goldy, run!

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:06.797
Straight on up!

01:12:06.831 --> 01:12:08.594
Go get the car!

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:10.997
Imabelle!

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.627
Shut up, man.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.371
Someday, Goldy! Someday...

01:12:27.415 --> 01:12:29.178
I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:12:33.021 --> 01:12:34.215
Jackson.

01:12:43.596 --> 01:12:46.224
<i>Imabelle!</i>

01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:47.289
Imabelle!

01:12:49.034 --> 01:12:50.763
<i>Show your hands now, sucker!</i>

01:12:50.802 --> 01:12:52.030
Jackson!

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:53.731
Imabelle!

01:12:53.772 --> 01:12:55.239
Imabelle!

01:12:56.507 --> 01:12:57.633
Jackson!

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:00.975
Imabelle!

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:06.471
Imabelle! I'm coming
to get you, baby!

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:07.710
I love you!

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.274
- Jackson!
- I love you, baby!

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.286
Jackson, don't jump!

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.481
Ohm

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.955
Imabelle!

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.855
Oh, my God! He made it!

01:13:19.794 --> 01:13:21.853
OK! OK! All right!

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:25.092
Imabelle! Imabelle! Imabelle!

01:13:25.131 --> 01:13:26.996
Oh, bless you, Jesus!

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:28.591
Ha! I made it!

01:13:28.635 --> 01:13:31.160
Jackson! Stop jumping!

01:13:33.505 --> 01:13:36.372
Ed! Ed! No, no, no, no, no!

01:13:38.276 --> 01:13:41.643
I'm crazy,
but I ain't no damn fool.

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:43.374
Someday, Goldy!

01:13:43.414 --> 01:13:45.109
Someday!

01:13:45.148 --> 01:13:46.479
Imabelle!

01:13:46.516 --> 01:13:48.040
Jackson! Jackson!

01:13:48.085 --> 01:13:50.645
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

01:13:50.686 --> 01:13:51.948
I love her.

01:13:51.987 --> 01:13:55.354
All right. But you got anything
against taking the stairs?

01:13:55.391 --> 01:13:56.756
<i>Shit!</i>

01:13:57.759 --> 01:13:59.158
- Taxi!
- Hey!

01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:00.957
Taxi!

01:14:03.798 --> 01:14:05.265
All right, get your ass out!

01:14:09.703 --> 01:14:11.068
Imabelle!

01:14:11.105 --> 01:14:13.630
- Imabelle!
- Come on!

01:14:13.673 --> 01:14:15.004
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:19.943
Come on, Jackson!
I'm gonna leave you!

01:14:19.978 --> 01:14:23.539
Hurry up!
Follow that red gypsy cab!

01:14:23.582 --> 01:14:25.106
Don't lose 'em!

01:14:28.185 --> 01:14:29.311
This way!

01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:33.850
There's nobody here. Huh?

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:36.688
- She went this way. I know it.
- You know it?!

01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:40.620
What are you listening
to him for?

01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:42.459
He's in love.

01:14:42.498 --> 01:14:43.658
That way!

01:14:51.439 --> 01:14:53.100
This is unbelievable.

01:14:53.141 --> 01:14:55.507
- There she is.
- This is unbe...

01:15:00.046 --> 01:15:02.810
Let's just go in there
and get her.

01:15:02.848 --> 01:15:06.614
Just wait a minute now.
Gotta do this thing right.

01:15:06.652 --> 01:15:08.847
See, what we really need
is something big enough...

01:15:08.887 --> 01:15:10.184
to carry the gold in.

01:15:10.221 --> 01:15:11.882
The hearse.

01:15:11.923 --> 01:15:13.254
<i>Your boss's hearse.</i>

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:15.122
I don't care nothing
about the gold.

01:15:15.159 --> 01:15:18.060
Hey, we got a deal, remember?
The girl for the gold.

01:15:18.095 --> 01:15:20.586
Or you can go up there
by yourself.

01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:22.326
All right.

01:15:22.365 --> 01:15:24.731
Just give me bullets
for my gun first.

01:15:26.536 --> 01:15:28.970
<i>- I'll give you one bullet.
- One bullet?</i>

01:15:29.004 --> 01:15:30.835
That's right. One bullet.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.040
<i>Deal?</i>

01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:35.064
Deal.

01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:41.398
- It's gonna be OK.
- What you saying, baby girl?

01:15:41.435 --> 01:15:45.064
I got a hole in my chest.
I need a fucking doctor!

01:15:45.105 --> 01:15:46.402
That's too damn bad.

01:15:46.439 --> 01:15:48.999
You got us hot as hell
as it is.

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:50.907
Jodie, you call Easy Money...

01:15:50.943 --> 01:15:53.776
<i>see if he can make that meeting
a little earlier.</i>

01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:57.643
Imabelle will stay
with the gold.

01:15:57.682 --> 01:15:58.910
- Imabelle?
- Imabelle?

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:01.510
Well, she can't do nothing
with it by herself.

01:16:01.552 --> 01:16:04.715
<i>What about Gus?</i>

01:16:04.755 --> 01:16:06.086
Fuck Gus.

01:16:06.123 --> 01:16:08.057
Hey, man,
what you talking about?

01:16:08.091 --> 01:16:10.321
Pop go the weasel.

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:13.226
Don't you kill him, Slim.

01:16:13.262 --> 01:16:16.129
Get the fuck outta the way.

01:16:17.265 --> 01:16:19.495
<i>Move!</i>

01:16:23.004 --> 01:16:25.199
Ah. Now, let's be kind to Gus.

01:16:25.239 --> 01:16:27.036
He is our friend.

01:16:37.617 --> 01:16:40.484
Hank, don't kill me, man.

01:16:40.519 --> 01:16:41.952
I got no choice, man.

01:16:41.987 --> 01:16:43.318
I don't want to die!

01:16:43.355 --> 01:16:45.789
<i>We'll take care
of your wife in Jersey.</i>

01:16:45.823 --> 01:16:50.260
Gus, baby,
you're giving dying a bad name.

01:16:52.063 --> 01:16:54.725
- Come on, Hank, get him!
- I'm doing the best I can, man!

01:16:54.764 --> 01:16:56.493
What do you want? Hold him.

01:16:56.533 --> 01:16:58.865
- Hold his head down.
- Come on, Hank!

01:16:58.902 --> 01:17:00.733
Come on, Gus, die!

01:17:00.769 --> 01:17:02.760
Come on, hold him, Jodie!

01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:09.040
Everybody happy?

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.275
You're just in time.

01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:20.377
<i>That's everyone
except Gus and the girl.</i>

01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:27.490
Parsons-number six.

01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:29.288
Don't make no noise.

01:17:29.327 --> 01:17:30.624
This guy is dangerous.

01:17:30.662 --> 01:17:32.152
No noise.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.392
No noise.

01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:50.207
Yes?

01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:51.371
Shh.

01:17:51.413 --> 01:17:53.608
Is that you, Imabelle?!
It's me... Jackson, baby!

01:17:53.648 --> 01:17:55.639
I've come here to rescue you!

01:17:55.683 --> 01:17:56.809
Daddy!

01:17:56.851 --> 01:18:00.252
Yeah, you be Daddy.
I'm gonna check the gold!

01:18:00.287 --> 01:18:02.016
We gotta go.

01:18:02.055 --> 01:18:03.613
Oh, shit.

01:18:04.924 --> 01:18:07.484
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:18:07.527 --> 01:18:09.017
Oh, God.

01:18:09.061 --> 01:18:11.154
Oh, God!

01:18:11.196 --> 01:18:12.925
I didn't do it, officer.

01:18:12.965 --> 01:18:14.159
Jackson!

01:18:14.199 --> 01:18:16.565
That ain't no officer.
This is my stepbrother Sherman.

01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:18.159
Oh, good.
Then you're just in time...

01:18:18.202 --> 01:18:19.499
to help me get
that trunk outta here.

01:18:19.537 --> 01:18:21.528
That's just what
we was intending on doing.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.563
And then what was you intending
on doing with it?

01:18:23.607 --> 01:18:25.598
Don't worry
about that right now!

01:18:25.642 --> 01:18:27.371
I got him under control.
I just want you...

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.002
to get outta here
before they come back in.

01:18:29.045 --> 01:18:30.376
You go downstairs
and you wait in the hearse.

01:18:30.412 --> 01:18:33.176
You take this trunk down,
and we'll be right behind you.

01:18:33.215 --> 01:18:34.842
Heh heh heh heh.

01:18:37.585 --> 01:18:39.314
What do you mean,
you got me under control?

01:18:39.354 --> 01:18:41.015
You ain't got me under control.

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:43.046
You gotta get her
under control. Come on.

01:18:51.998 --> 01:18:55.195
Hey, baby girl!
Where you think you going?

01:18:55.234 --> 01:18:57.259
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:02.137
<i>You come here!</i>

01:19:02.174 --> 01:19:06.133
Please! No! Aah!

01:19:11.115 --> 01:19:15.074
Hold her, Jodie!

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:18.212
You know you hurt me, girl,
when you do this kind of shit.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.552
You hurt me deep.

01:19:27.862 --> 01:19:30.092
Aah!

01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:33.558
Here, here, here.
Let me help you.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.033
Where is she?

01:19:35.068 --> 01:19:37.127
- She took off.
- What, she go back in?

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:40.071
Here. I don't...
I don't think so.

01:19:40.105 --> 01:19:42.699
Well, she got to be around here
somewhere. Where is she?

01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:44.902
<i>She took off up the street.</i>

01:19:46.345 --> 01:19:48.245
How about we come back for her?

01:19:48.279 --> 01:19:50.679
I ain't going nowhere.
I ain't leaving her.

01:19:50.715 --> 01:19:52.842
I came here to get her.

01:19:52.884 --> 01:19:55.352
Jackson. Shit!

01:19:57.521 --> 01:19:59.489
Did you see that?

01:19:59.523 --> 01:20:01.753
- We're not leaving him.
- No, no, no.

01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:04.021
You think I'm going
to leave my stepbrother?

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.857
I told you we were going
to get that gold, didn't I?

01:20:05.895 --> 01:20:07.658
Yeah. Just hurry up
so we can keep it, eh?

01:20:07.697 --> 01:20:09.597
I'll get him.
We'll be right back.

01:20:15.236 --> 01:20:18.603
- Jackson!
- Jesus.

01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:20.664
Jackson, what are you doing?

01:20:20.708 --> 01:20:24.144
She's gone... and I love her.

01:20:24.177 --> 01:20:27.544
I know that, I know that,
but the gold is back there...

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.842
and it's just begging
for trouble.

01:20:28.881 --> 01:20:32.146
You don't get the gold
unless I found Imabelle!

01:20:32.184 --> 01:20:33.811
I did find you Imabelle.

01:20:33.852 --> 01:20:35.683
Well, where is she?

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.382
Come on, man.
She don't want to stay found.

01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:40.720
Shit, she ran away.

01:20:40.758 --> 01:20:42.988
Get that into your head, man.
She don't want to be with you.

01:20:43.026 --> 01:20:47.190
You don't know nothing
about love!

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:50.393
All you know is whores.

01:20:50.432 --> 01:20:53.458
Don't you tell me...

01:20:53.502 --> 01:20:55.561
about my head.

01:20:55.604 --> 01:20:58.164
You know, Jackson,
you're just like Mama.

01:20:58.206 --> 01:21:00.106
Don't talk about Ma!

01:21:00.141 --> 01:21:05.044
You do not talk
about my mother.

01:21:05.078 --> 01:21:08.206
Hey, fuck you!
She was my mama, too!

01:21:08.248 --> 01:21:10.079
And I loved her
just as much as you did!

01:21:10.117 --> 01:21:11.550
You didn't even go
to the funeral.

01:21:11.584 --> 01:21:13.176
I'll bet you ain't
even been to the...

01:21:13.219 --> 01:21:16.086
to the grave site once.

01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:18.488
I've been...

01:21:18.523 --> 01:21:20.252
I've been to the grave site.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.987
<i>I've been there!</i>

01:21:34.737 --> 01:21:37.934
Is that our gold
in the back of that hearse?

01:21:37.974 --> 01:21:40.067
Damn straight, it is.

01:22:00.926 --> 01:22:03.417
You got to hold me
so tight, Jodie?

01:22:03.462 --> 01:22:06.590
Hope your lips don't give me
no shit, big mouth.

01:22:17.274 --> 01:22:19.333
Uhh! Uhh!

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.477
<i>Ima, get out of here!</i>

01:22:24.513 --> 01:22:26.913
Bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up!

01:22:26.949 --> 01:22:28.678
Come here, shorty,
I'll show you something.

01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:31.584
Come here, come here.
You want to see this, huh?

01:22:31.619 --> 01:22:33.553
Yo.

01:22:33.588 --> 01:22:36.079
Think about this, brother.
Just think about this.

01:22:36.123 --> 01:22:37.613
You think about this right now.

01:22:37.658 --> 01:22:40.456
Take your best shot, sucker.

01:22:40.494 --> 01:22:42.052
Ohm

01:22:42.095 --> 01:22:44.495
Oh, no, no.
You get up here, boy.

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:46.054
Stand up there.

01:22:46.099 --> 01:22:47.964
Uhh!

01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:49.935
Uhh!

01:22:49.968 --> 01:22:51.435
<i>Hit him again.</i>

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:53.734
Ohh.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.003
I thought I recognized
that voice.

01:22:58.042 --> 01:23:00.909
This the bitch who run
the cathouse we were at.

01:23:00.945 --> 01:23:03.004
<i>- Nah.
- Yeah.</i>

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:07.847
Last time I saw you,
you was dressed as a woman.

01:23:07.884 --> 01:23:11.445
- Disgusting.
- Ain't that right, bitch?

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.081
Jackson, look...

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:19.086
I'm sorry, Jackson. I'm sorry.

01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:22.591
<i>I should've gone
to the funeral.</i>

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.996
<i>I didn't go. I didn't want
to embarrass everybody.</i>

01:23:25.032 --> 01:23:28.092
I know how everybody
in the family feels about me.

01:23:31.137 --> 01:23:33.935
I should've been there.

01:23:33.973 --> 01:23:35.964
I'm sorry.

01:23:36.008 --> 01:23:37.976
Jackson!

01:23:39.077 --> 01:23:40.601
<i>Jackson!</i>

01:23:42.747 --> 01:23:46.080
- I thought you were gone.
- Oh, Jackson! Jackson!

01:23:46.116 --> 01:23:47.947
<i>They're trying to kill
your friend, Jackson.</i>

01:23:47.985 --> 01:23:49.680
They're trying to kill
your friend!

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.880
Kathy!

01:23:52.355 --> 01:23:53.720
Wait a minute.

01:23:55.158 --> 01:23:58.093
It's your last time, punk.

01:23:58.127 --> 01:24:01.858
You talk to me, or I'm going
to let him fuck you up.

01:24:01.897 --> 01:24:06.527
Where's Jackson
and the other phony cop?

01:24:06.567 --> 01:24:08.899
Fuck you.

01:24:12.505 --> 01:24:15.065
Hmm. Pop go the weasel.

01:24:16.276 --> 01:24:18.540
No...

01:24:18.578 --> 01:24:22.309
fuck you.

01:24:22.347 --> 01:24:24.076
Uhh.

01:24:25.384 --> 01:24:27.079
<i>Uhh.</i>

01:24:28.872 --> 01:24:31.705
Kathy! Kathy!

01:24:36.545 --> 01:24:38.137
God!

01:24:44.252 --> 01:24:45.583
Kathy.

01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:49.252
- It's me.
- Boss...

01:24:49.289 --> 01:24:51.553
- it's Goldy.
- Uhh.

01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:54.059
Come on, man.
Come on, Kathy. Don't die.

01:24:54.094 --> 01:24:56.062
You hear what I'm saying?

01:24:56.095 --> 01:24:59.258
Don't die, OK?

01:24:59.298 --> 01:25:00.595
Kathy...

01:25:04.369 --> 01:25:08.567
OK. OK. I'm going
to close your eyes.

01:25:13.944 --> 01:25:15.639
Sherman.

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:26.549
I want those murdering
bastard friends of yours...

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.148
and you're going to take me
to them right now!

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.919
No, don't. Sherman, don't.

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:34.151
Jackson, Jackson,
you all right?

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.288
Baby, you all right?

01:25:36.329 --> 01:25:39.457
<i>- Get your hands off of me!
- Don't hurt her.</i>

01:25:39.499 --> 01:25:40.796
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:42.426
Take it easy?!

01:25:42.469 --> 01:25:46.303
I took it easy back there
jerking around with you...

01:25:46.338 --> 01:25:50.035
<i>when I should've been watching
out for my real family.</i>

01:25:50.075 --> 01:25:52.908
Yeah, man, make a move...

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:56.471
so I can blow her fucking brains
out on the sidewalk.

01:25:56.514 --> 01:26:00.348
Make a fucking move!

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.248
I'm sorry.

01:26:09.225 --> 01:26:10.317
Sherman!

01:26:13.695 --> 01:26:15.856
You know, you take
that gun off my head...

01:26:15.897 --> 01:26:17.694
I'll have an easier time
driving.

01:26:17.732 --> 01:26:19.093
I mean,
it's kind of distracting...

01:26:19.099 --> 01:26:20.964
Shut up, bitch!

01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:23.765
The only person I ever cared
about in this whole world...

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:25.829
just died because of
your worthless ass!

01:26:25.872 --> 01:26:28.898
I don't like what they did
any more than you...

01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:30.431
but what do I get out of this?

01:26:30.476 --> 01:26:32.171
We're gonna play a game,
you and me.

01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.973
I don't know how many bullets
in this fucking gun...

01:26:34.012 --> 01:26:36.139
but we're gonna play a game,
you and me.

01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:37.671
You wanna play?

01:26:37.716 --> 01:26:39.445
- Yeah!
- Let's play!

01:26:39.483 --> 01:26:42.008
Don't fuck with me!

01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:53.927
<i>Um!</i>

01:26:53.962 --> 01:26:56.931
Fuck!

01:26:56.965 --> 01:26:59.024
You kill me,
you don't get nothing.

01:26:59.067 --> 01:27:01.934
Not even revenge.

01:27:01.969 --> 01:27:04.335
What do you want?

01:27:04.372 --> 01:27:06.567
I want a fifty-fifty split.

01:27:06.607 --> 01:27:09.201
- Uh-uh.
- I planned that robbery.

01:27:09.242 --> 01:27:11.403
Pad of that money's mine.

01:27:11.444 --> 01:27:14.607
You tell me where they are,
it's a deal.

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:19.880
No. I go with you all the way.

01:27:22.253 --> 01:27:24.278
All right.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.950
<i>All right, it's a deal.</i>

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.951
But you fuck with me...

01:27:35.231 --> 01:27:40.225
and I'm gonna do to you what
your boyfriend did to Big Kathy.

01:27:51.812 --> 01:27:53.973
152 grand. Ha ha!

01:27:56.816 --> 01:28:00.377
Too bad you didn't
bring your lady friend.

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:04.413
I had another dream about her.

01:28:04.456 --> 01:28:09.291
Ahh... hoo, shit!
I can't tell you about it.

01:28:09.328 --> 01:28:12.593
You were in it,
weren't you, baby?

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:17.699
<i>Yeah, you were.</i>

01:28:20.236 --> 01:28:21.430
Listen...

01:28:23.039 --> 01:28:25.564
I'm quite fed up with you...

01:28:26.742 --> 01:28:29.836
Diddling with your
little rat dog there...

01:28:31.346 --> 01:28:33.906
And running your mouth
all over my woman.

01:28:33.948 --> 01:28:37.008
You stop that shit.

01:28:37.051 --> 01:28:39.952
God damn it, Slim. Calm down.

01:28:39.987 --> 01:28:43.616
You stop that shit!

01:28:51.564 --> 01:28:54.294
Come on, Slim.
We done come too far.

01:29:04.241 --> 01:29:07.369
You better get
some etiquette classes...

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:10.811
before you try and do business
in the big city, boy.

01:29:10.847 --> 01:29:13.111
Boy?

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:15.378
You see a boy?

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.981
Grave Digger Jones here.

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:24.150
- It's Goldy.
- Goldy! Where the fuck are you?

01:29:24.191 --> 01:29:27.024
<i>Bastards killed Big Kathy,
and I'm gonna pay 'em back.</i>

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.028
<i>If you and Coffin Ed
can stop thinking...</i>

01:29:29.062 --> 01:29:31.792
about shooting my ass,
I think I can do you a favor.

01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:32.991
All right, go on.

01:29:33.033 --> 01:29:35.627
Some people are gonna have
to die on this one.

01:29:35.668 --> 01:29:37.033
As long as it ain't me or Ed...

01:29:37.069 --> 01:29:39.230
I don't give a shit.
Just pan of the job.

01:29:47.278 --> 01:29:53.012
No sense in getting our heads
worked up over business.

01:29:55.918 --> 01:29:57.647
That's right! Ha ha ha!

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:04.191
Eh, your friend Imabelle...

01:30:04.225 --> 01:30:08.355
already got another pan
of me worked up...

01:30:08.396 --> 01:30:13.356
and it ain't my head.
Ha ha ha!

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.163
Ha ha ha!

01:30:16.869 --> 01:30:18.837
- That's it!
- That's what?

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:20.600
- That's it!
- What?

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.505
I done told you.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:24.009
<i>Jodie, talk to him!</i>

01:30:24.042 --> 01:30:25.942
Pop go the weasel!

01:30:25.977 --> 01:30:28.537
- What you talking about, Slim?
- Pop go the weasel!

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.447
- We come too far for this!
- No! Pop go the weasel!

01:30:31.482 --> 01:30:34.246
Save that nursery school shit
for Mississippi, chump.

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.048
- Chump?!
- Yeah! Chump. Pussy!

01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:42.285
You don't know me that well.

01:30:42.325 --> 01:30:44.793
- He didn't mean nothing by that.
- Aw, pussy, get outta here!

01:30:44.827 --> 01:30:46.727
- That's it!
- It can't be it! Come on, y'all!

01:30:46.762 --> 01:30:50.459
Pop go the weasel!
Pop go the motherfucking weasel!

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:53.562
Slim! Aah!

01:31:00.574 --> 01:31:01.734
Damn it!

01:31:09.648 --> 01:31:13.812
<i>Uhh! Baby! Not the dog.</i>

01:31:15.019 --> 01:31:18.318
Don't touch the dog.

01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:23.819
<i>Don't worry, baby.
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you.</i>

01:31:25.262 --> 01:31:27.127
Don't shoot my dog, man.

01:31:27.163 --> 01:31:29.893
<i>That's where I draw the line.</i>

01:31:29.932 --> 01:31:31.627
<i>That just ain't right.</i>

01:31:31.667 --> 01:31:33.430
I'll give you
the motherfucking money...

01:31:33.468 --> 01:31:35.902
you can walk out of here...

01:31:35.937 --> 01:31:39.600
just don't let me see you
shooting no dog.

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.235
I want the money
and I want the gold.

01:31:43.277 --> 01:31:45.336
Now, you know I can't do that.

01:31:45.379 --> 01:31:48.007
Fine. Then I'm gonna
kill your rat.

01:31:48.047 --> 01:31:50.106
All right! All right!
All right!

01:31:50.150 --> 01:31:53.415
Take the money and the gold
and get out of town.

01:31:56.488 --> 01:31:59.082
Now, just put my dog down.

01:31:59.124 --> 01:32:01.922
<i>- Put your gun down.
- I'll put the gun down.</i>

01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:03.984
Step away from it!

01:32:04.028 --> 01:32:07.054
All right, I put my gun down.

01:32:07.098 --> 01:32:09.464
Please put my dog down.

01:32:13.703 --> 01:32:15.193
Here, baby.

01:32:15.237 --> 01:32:16.329
No!

01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:22.609
- Goldy, you all right?
- Imabelle!

01:32:22.644 --> 01:32:24.771
Imabelle, come here!

01:32:26.047 --> 01:32:28.379
You want this?
You want me?

01:32:28.415 --> 01:32:30.849
- Baby...
- Motherfucker!

01:32:30.884 --> 01:32:35.617
- You want some more? Here!
- Forgive me, baby.

01:32:35.655 --> 01:32:38.522
Imabelle! God damn it! Shit!

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.354
God damn it! Shit!

01:32:43.395 --> 01:32:46.831
You still carry this? Ha ha!

01:32:46.865 --> 01:32:49.527
- Let her go, god damn it!
- Fuck you!

01:33:00.081 --> 01:33:02.311
Let her go!
I'll kill her, I swear!

01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:04.375
You kill her!

01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:08.251
Ain't that your woman?
Huh? I'll kill her!

01:33:08.288 --> 01:33:09.846
Go on and kill her!

01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:17.926
You killed him, didn't you?

01:33:17.962 --> 01:33:21.193
<i>Who, your girlfriend?</i>

01:33:21.232 --> 01:33:23.291
You killed Big Kathy.

01:33:23.334 --> 01:33:25.564
You cut his throat,
you bastard!

01:33:25.602 --> 01:33:28.935
What, you grieving
'cause that he-bitch is dead?

01:33:28.972 --> 01:33:31.805
I'm gonna put you
out your misery.

01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:35.775
<i>Slim!</i>

01:33:40.415 --> 01:33:44.476
Hey, baby, there he is,
Simple Simon.

01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:48.114
You let him be!

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:50.123
It's me you want.

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:54.560
That's right. It's you I want.

01:33:54.594 --> 01:33:58.086
Jackson,
shoot this motherfucker!

01:33:58.131 --> 01:34:01.760
I don't need this
to do what I got to do.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.897
Jackson, you need that!
Shoot this bastard!

01:34:06.937 --> 01:34:11.340
You put the razor down.

01:34:11.375 --> 01:34:14.833
I'll put the gun down.

01:34:14.878 --> 01:34:19.645
I'll fight you for her...
like a man.

01:34:19.682 --> 01:34:23.311
For as God is my judge...

01:34:23.352 --> 01:34:25.820
I love you
more than life itself.

01:34:25.854 --> 01:34:27.879
- Oh, Jackson...
- Shut up, bitch!

01:34:27.922 --> 01:34:30.891
Like a good dog,
you stay right there.

01:34:40.867 --> 01:34:42.357
Huh! Uhh!

01:34:43.869 --> 01:34:46.667
You ain't no man.
I ain't even armed.

01:34:46.705 --> 01:34:51.733
I can't believe you'd say
no funky shit like that.

01:34:51.776 --> 01:34:53.243
Ha ha ha!

01:34:53.278 --> 01:34:56.042
- Jackson, run! Run outta here!
- You stay outta this!

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.414
<i>? All around
the mulberry bush ?</i>

01:35:02.085 --> 01:35:05.350
Yea, though I walk
through the valley...

01:35:05.388 --> 01:35:08.255
<i>I The monkey
chased the weasel ?</i>

01:35:08.291 --> 01:35:10.782
Aah!

01:35:10.826 --> 01:35:14.091
This dance for you, baby girl!

01:35:16.230 --> 01:35:17.197
Uhh!

01:35:17.231 --> 01:35:18.562
Aah!

01:35:18.599 --> 01:35:21.966
I will fear no evil...

01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:24.732
The monkey thought
it was all in fun.

01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:27.569
In the house of the Lord.

01:35:35.547 --> 01:35:37.208
We ain't gotta do this.

01:35:37.248 --> 01:35:40.376
- No.
- Ain't gotta do this.

01:35:40.418 --> 01:35:41.612
<i>Uhh!</i>

01:35:43.954 --> 01:35:46.047
All fall down!

01:35:46.089 --> 01:35:47.351
Pop!

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:48.652
Uhh!

01:35:58.099 --> 01:36:00.260
<i>Uhh!</i>

01:36:03.538 --> 01:36:05.631
That'll be Grave Digger
and Coffin Ed.

01:36:05.672 --> 01:36:08.766
I made a deal with them.
Told them about the gold...

01:36:08.809 --> 01:36:12.176
but I didn't tell them nothing
about no money.

01:36:12.211 --> 01:36:14.679
<i>You take this
and get on outta here!</i>

01:36:14.714 --> 01:36:17.945
Listen to me. I want you
to stay behind this bar.

01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:19.679
I'm gonna go out there
and make sure...

01:36:19.718 --> 01:36:21.015
these cops
don't hurt my brother.

01:36:21.052 --> 01:36:23.816
Here, take this.
Keep this safe.

01:36:23.855 --> 01:36:26.187
No, what are you doing?

01:36:26.223 --> 01:36:28.214
What are you doing?
You can't trust her!

01:36:28.259 --> 01:36:30.090
Take that money
and get on outta here!

01:36:30.127 --> 01:36:32.322
Sherman, why you always
gotta assume...

01:36:32.363 --> 01:36:34.797
that everybody
is untrustworthy?

01:36:34.831 --> 01:36:35.957
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:36:37.467 --> 01:36:40.459
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

01:36:40.502 --> 01:36:42.868
Can't you see
that this man is injured?

01:36:42.905 --> 01:36:44.839
Damn that man!
Where's the damn gold, sucker?

01:36:44.873 --> 01:36:47.000
It's in Easy Money's office.

01:36:47.041 --> 01:36:49.805
Let's go! Let's go!
Move 'em out!

01:36:49.844 --> 01:36:53.007
Let's go, Goldy!
You got blood, whatever!

01:36:53.047 --> 01:36:54.674
<i>Get on in there!</i>

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.625
What did I tell you, huh?

01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:20.296
She's inside.

01:37:20.337 --> 01:37:22.237
She is gone.

01:37:22.271 --> 01:37:24.705
She's inside.

01:37:26.509 --> 01:37:28.340
She's inside.

01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:32.710
Must have gotten delayed.

01:37:32.747 --> 01:37:35.773
She's permanently delayed.
She skated with the money.

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.408
I gotta see a doctor.

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:39.385
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.320
We were admiring
the body count back there.

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.323
<i>And what a nice day's
work you did.</i>

01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:45.756
And how happy some undertaker
was gonna be...

01:37:45.792 --> 01:37:49.523
when we remembered you was
wanted for robbing your boss.

01:37:49.562 --> 01:37:51.587
<i>It was not part
of Goldy's deal.</i>

01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:54.656
- Come on, we're taking you in.
- Wait a minute!

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.726
Are you resisting arrest?

01:38:00.304 --> 01:38:04.035
I'm sorry, bros.
I'll do what I can.

01:38:06.009 --> 01:38:10.571
Don't matter.
Nothing matters no more.

01:38:16.585 --> 01:38:19.645
<i>Someday, Goldy, someday!</i>

01:38:23.358 --> 01:38:25.883
<i>I want my phone call!</i>

01:38:27.461 --> 01:38:30.259
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

01:38:33.165 --> 01:38:35.429
Get your ass up, sucker.

01:38:41.306 --> 01:38:47.074
Who brought me these clothes,
made bail for me... a woman?

01:38:47.111 --> 01:38:48.874
Hell, no.

01:38:54.784 --> 01:38:55.944
Mr. Clay.

01:38:55.985 --> 01:38:58.078
Well, well, well...

01:38:58.121 --> 01:39:00.715
here's the big,
bad man himself.

01:39:00.756 --> 01:39:03.384
Time you put
your six-shooter away...

01:39:03.425 --> 01:39:05.256
and take out
your adding machine.

01:39:05.294 --> 01:39:07.319
You drummed us up some work.

01:39:07.361 --> 01:39:12.162
Two of them boys that was killed
was carrying eight grand apiece.

01:39:12.199 --> 01:39:15.464
<i>That money was just contributed
towards their funeral.</i>

01:39:15.502 --> 01:39:19.165
Oh, by the way, a lovely,
lovely young lady...

01:39:19.205 --> 01:39:23.005
came by the office
and asked me to give you...

01:39:25.411 --> 01:39:27.743
The cross.

01:39:27.779 --> 01:39:29.303
Train station!

01:39:29.347 --> 01:39:31.281
Where you think you going,
Jackson?

01:39:31.316 --> 01:39:33.614
I just made your bail!

01:39:35.152 --> 01:39:37.620
<i>Train 55,
bound for Mississippi...</i>

01:39:37.654 --> 01:39:39.519
Here they are, Goldy.

01:39:39.556 --> 01:39:42.582
<i>leaving from platform 9.
AH aboard.</i>

01:39:43.759 --> 01:39:44.726
Oh.

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.988
Sherman,
what are you doing here?

01:39:46.028 --> 01:39:48.326
Goddamn fool oughta be
getting some rest.

01:39:48.364 --> 01:39:50.662
After you get shot,
it's always a good idea...

01:39:50.699 --> 01:39:52.360
to spend a few days in bed!

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.699
Good God Almighty!
It's payday, man!

01:39:55.736 --> 01:39:58.261
There's about
$50,000 here, man!

01:39:58.305 --> 01:39:59.272
<i>Count yours.</i>

01:39:59.306 --> 01:40:01.001
She says I'm too good for her.

01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:03.942
She's right!
But count the money, man!

01:40:03.976 --> 01:40:05.807
Hey, have you seen a woman...

01:40:05.845 --> 01:40:08.279
With the sweetest ass
God ever made?

01:40:08.314 --> 01:40:11.647
I just took her to platform 9,
train bound for Mississippi.

01:40:11.683 --> 01:40:15.346
Jackson! Jackson!

01:40:15.387 --> 01:40:17.981
Jackson, this is fifty... oh!

01:40:22.193 --> 01:40:25.651
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

01:40:25.695 --> 01:40:28.027
Take this money now.
Big Kathy wants you to have it.

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:30.498
- I don't want it!
- Wait a minute!

01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:34.332
Good luck, brother.

01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:35.928
You're gonna need it.
I love you.

01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:38.132
God bless you.
God bless you, Goldy.

01:40:38.172 --> 01:40:40.538
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:40:43.211 --> 01:40:45.543
He called me Goldy.

01:40:45.579 --> 01:40:47.410
Look at him. Look at him run!

01:40:47.447 --> 01:40:49.005
In all the years
I know that chump...

01:40:49.049 --> 01:40:50.676
I never seen him run so fast.

01:40:53.786 --> 01:40:55.185
<i>If I had somebody like her...</i>

01:40:55.221 --> 01:40:57.086
- Goldy!
- I'd run fast, too.

01:40:57.123 --> 01:40:58.818
<i>Yeah, he'll be back.</i>

01:40:58.857 --> 01:41:00.688
Jackson in Mississippi?

01:41:00.725 --> 01:41:02.955
It's like getting change
from a penny.

You getting sentimental
on me, Goldy?

But I'm recovering.
I'm recovering rapidly!

01:41:11.168 --> 01:41:13.636
Money! There's a lot
of money here, ladies.
