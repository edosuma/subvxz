WEBVTT

00:03.738 --> 00:05.170
Morrow's dead.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.774
Jessica terdei, she was
with fornell when he got shot.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.609
Prep him for surgery!
Is he gonna be okay?

00:10.611 --> 00:12.711
Clayton Reeves. MI6.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.680
This FBI special agent
Tess Monroe.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.016
Jacob's already killed
former director morrow,

00:17.018 --> 00:18.450
MI6 chief terdei.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.401
Where's Jacob?

00:19.402 --> 00:20.351
Boss, he's in the Navy yard.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.354
I'm being set up
for those murders.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.540
Jacob's telling the truth.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.725
I think someone used Jacob's
file to create a fake print.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.628
Kort was the one selling secrets
to the Russians, not Jacob.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.363
Tony:
Kort disappeared right after

00:31.364 --> 00:33.097
he learned about Ziva.
He may know about Eli's files.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.800
He's running.
I can guess where he's going.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.201
Israel?
McGee:
Boss,

00:36.203 --> 00:37.503
look at this.

00:37.504 --> 00:38.804
Reporter:
The house previously belonged

00:38.806 --> 00:41.573
to Mossad director Eli David.
Isn't that...

00:41.575 --> 00:43.208
Where Ziva's supposed
to be staying.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.080
The blast occurred
just hours ago

00:48.082 --> 00:49.715
in this tiny Israeli village

00:49.717 --> 00:51.450
on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.752
The farmhouse belonging
to the former Mossad director,

00:53.754 --> 00:56.422
the late Eli David,

00:56.424 --> 00:58.323
was the apparent target
of mortar fire

00:58.325 --> 01:00.092
just before midnight.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.829
Several terror groups have
already claimed responsibility.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.364
More like
a one-man terror group.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.166
Where's Trent kort?

01:07.168 --> 01:08.734
No word, Gibbs.
All previous means

01:08.736 --> 01:11.470
of locating or contacting Trent
kort have been disconnected.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.805
None of his former CIA people,

01:12.807 --> 01:14.306
no GPS to track,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.141
nothing, boss.
It's like he fell of the grid.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.343
DiNozzo.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.578
Still no Ziva.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.648
I tracked down Adam eshel
in Belgium.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.616
He, uh, hasn't spoken
to her in over a year,

01:24.618 --> 01:26.351
but he was pretty sure
she was staying

01:26.353 --> 01:29.338
at her father's old house.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.324
And, uh, we are just receiving
late word of a possible survivor

01:32.326 --> 01:33.792
being pulled from the rubble.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.427
No identity as yet,

01:35.429 --> 01:37.329
as rescuers continue to dig.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.630
A survivor.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.767
I can't stay here.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.836
We know that.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.404
If that's Ziva, I got to go.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.573
We know. McGee, get him a plane.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.225
It's already booked.

01:49.226 --> 01:50.876
The plane leaves
for Tel Aviv in four hours.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.144
Boarding pass is in your inbox.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.546
What are you waiting for?
Hey.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.616
Go.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.353
¶ ¶

02:29.650 --> 02:31.216
what is really surprising
about this attack

02:31.218 --> 02:33.285
(knocking on door)
Is that it would...

02:33.287 --> 02:35.287
(Door closes)
I got Mossad to confirm

02:35.289 --> 02:38.557
that Ziva's been residing
at the farm house, Gibbs.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.325
That's all that
they were willing to share.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.527
(Sighs)

02:41.529 --> 02:43.162
No surprise.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.930
Still no sign of kort, huh?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.331
We'll find him.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.200
After this bombing,

02:48.202 --> 02:51.737
he could've easily crossed over
to Egypt, Jordan.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.739
Any help from interpol?

02:53.741 --> 02:56.375
Agent Monroe's got
a contact there.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.712
Knows of a safe house that kort
used in the past in Budapest.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.247
It's worth checking out.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.616
Doctor:
<i> Good news is we'll be moving</i>

03:04.618 --> 03:06.718
your father out of the icu
in the next day or two.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.520
He gave us all

03:08.522 --> 03:10.656
quite a scare but fought hard.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.791
He managed to clear that first
hurdle beautifully.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.726
And the bad news?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.829
Second hurdle?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.931
I won't lie,
he's got a long road ahead.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.200
The bullet narrowly
missed his spine

03:21.202 --> 03:23.635
but still caused
significant nerve damage.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237
Are you saying he's paralyzed?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.505
Nothing permanent.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.507
We anticipate problems

03:28.509 --> 03:29.541
with his right arm and leg.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.510
He faces extensive rehab,

03:31.512 --> 03:34.680
and they'll be tough times
ahead, I'm afraid.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.816
(Sighs) Been there, done that.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.551
Nothing he can't handle.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.953
(Crying)

03:42.756 --> 03:44.590
I got to get this, excuse me.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.863
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.931
Gibbs, you haven't
answered your cell phone

03:52.933 --> 03:54.533
for a couple of days

03:54.535 --> 03:56.301
and your coworkers
said you'd be here.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.002
Yup.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.637
Here I am.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.505
So, um, how you holding up?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.542
Okay then,
how are<i> you</i> holding up?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.377
Uh, Emily, isn't it?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.511
I'm grace.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.547
Not great, grace,
to be honest.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.016
Who is this now? A girlfriend?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.818
Head shrinker.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.952
Seriously?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.022
I'm not here
to shrink anyone's head.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.825
Though I am very sorry
for what you're going through.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.026
If there's anything
i can do...

04:21.028 --> 04:22.761
Well, actually, there is.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.862
There is?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.498
Well, yeah.
If we're gonna catch the guy

04:26.500 --> 04:29.968
who did this,
i would rather you not be alone.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.970
Uh, you mind
sticking around?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.473
What? No.
I-i don't even know her.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.941
I don't know you either,
sweetie,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.342
so we have that in common.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.343
Gibbs.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.811
Whoa.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.346
Look at those beauties.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.615
Your handy work, popeye?

04:43.617 --> 04:44.516
They're not done yet.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.486
We ran out of Polish.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.920
Hey, I can go get you some more.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.689
Is that "flamingo drag?"

04:50.691 --> 04:53.959
"Watermelon pie."

04:53.961 --> 04:55.360
You would do that?

04:55.362 --> 04:56.895
What, to kick those up
a notch?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.630
Hey, why don't we both go?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.666
We'll grab some more colors,
a couple of lattes,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.301
and then we'll come right back.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.370
(Quietly):
You can trust her.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.572
(In normal voice):
I do.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.907
(Sighs)
Okay.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.042
Give me a second.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.610
Okay.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.781
Wow. You trust me.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.915
I owe you.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.016
I'll bill you.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.518
Kidding.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.720
You asked and I came.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.622
Plus, I'm well versed
in teenage girls.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.823
I was once one myself.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.024
Hmm.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.693
Well, she's a lot more
than that.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.095
I wish you luck.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.797
I think you're gonna need it.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.699
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.667
And you're welcome.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.636
Gibbs:
Hey,

05:37.638 --> 05:39.071
where you been?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.072
Well, I considered
getting a massage,

05:40.074 --> 05:41.540
but I can't find my neck.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.441
(Groans)

05:42.443 --> 05:43.742
Tell me about it.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.843
You find kort?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.814
I'm still waiting on my guys
from across the pond.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.982
They don't work
quite as fast as we do.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.467
For good reason.

05:52.468 --> 05:53.951
You want speed
or do you want accuracy?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.054
Gibbs.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.857
Where's agent DiNozzo?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.426
Headed to Israel.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.662
His plane leaves
in a few hours.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.833
What is it, director?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.970
I just got a call...

06:11.972 --> 06:13.772
(Voice breaking):
From Tel Aviv.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.582
You'll want to sleep
on the plane, son.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.817
I can give you a little
something that works for me.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.152
That's all right.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.921
I'm not gonna sleep, dad.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.990
Look, it's gonna
be fine, junior.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.626
You do know that, right?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.728
No, actually, I don't.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.130
Well...

06:38.132 --> 06:39.998
I guess it's better
to be prepared,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.800
but I've got this feeling...

06:41.802 --> 06:43.635
The feeling of what? The feeling
that she's still alive?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.771
So do I.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.140
But I don't know
that she's still alive.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.674
And nobody knows anything,

06:49.676 --> 06:51.977
so what's the point
in feeling anything at all?

06:51.979 --> 06:54.613
I didn't mean
to make things worse.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.182
Listen, I know
you're trying to help,

06:57.184 --> 06:58.784
and I appreciate it,

06:58.786 --> 07:01.787
but I'm a wreck.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.123
You're a rock, son.
(Knocking)

07:05.125 --> 07:07.759
That'll be my ride.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.060
You finish,
I'll get it.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.897
Thanks, dad.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.571
Hey.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.107
I'm on the run, I got...

07:22.109 --> 07:25.143
Hey, Tony.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.013
McGee:
We, uh...

07:28.015 --> 07:30.849
Vance got a call.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.151
(Sighs)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.619
(Softly):
Ziva.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.958
(Bags thump)

07:42.696 --> 07:45.096
(Voice breaking):
Are we sure?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.234
(Sighs heavily)

07:53.140 --> 07:55.607
I'm so sorry, Tony.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.889
It's devastating.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.858
The intensity of the fire

08:12.860 --> 08:15.527
reduced most
of the farmhouse to ashes.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.863
Makes no sense.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.898
Just when you think she'd
finally found peace at home.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.766
Indeed.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.169
Well, life rarely ends
the way we imagine.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.204
Yeah, Ziva, she would've,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.906
she would've gone out swinging,
you know?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.941
You know, just fighting
till her last breath.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.576
Instead of ambushed

08:31.578 --> 08:34.880
in her sleep by some coward
with a mortar launcher.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.883
Hey, how's Tony?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.085
Uh, about how you'd expect.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.953
Anything we can do for him?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.722
He made one request.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.890
That we do what Ziva would do.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.925
Find Trent kort.

08:46.927 --> 08:47.893
And kill him.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.995
(Computer chimes)

08:52.199 --> 08:54.132
Here it is,
Dr. Mallard MI6 is finally

08:54.134 --> 08:55.634
giving us permission

08:55.635 --> 08:57.135
to perform
director terdei's autopsy.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.171
Then let us make haste,
Mr. Palmer.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.008
Perhaps she can
point us towards kort.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.143
Wherever he may slither.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.555
(Sighs):
Okay.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.303
What are you doing here?

09:31.305 --> 09:33.004
What am I doing?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.205
What are you doing?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.807
What are<i> we</i> doing?

09:35.809 --> 09:36.875
Is anybody here?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.176
Oh, DiNozzo.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.745
What do we know?
What are the facts?

09:40.747 --> 09:41.746
'Cause we don't assume,
we verify.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.298
Do we know she's dead?

09:43.299 --> 09:44.849
'Cause if we know she's dead,
we're gonna get him.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.152
Yeah, she's dead,
and we will get kort.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.987
Us. Not you.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.188
Oh, yes, me!

09:50.190 --> 09:51.957
We've lost agents before,
haven't we?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.058
And when we do,

09:53.060 --> 09:56.027
(pounding)
It's all hands on deck!

09:56.029 --> 09:58.663
She's more than an agent to you.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.166
She was a daughter to you.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.802
She was a sister to McGee

10:03.804 --> 10:05.437
and Abby, and...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.071
She was no more to me
than anybody.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.808
Well, that's not true.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.942
Yes, it is!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.677
And why are you following me?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.948
Come back home, junior.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.116
No!

10:19.886 --> 10:22.053
(Softly):
I can't.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.657
(Sniffling)

10:25.659 --> 10:27.192
You need time.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.195
I need to know what happened.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.997
You need to breathe.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.898
I'll breathe
when Trent kort is dead.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.735
Senior:
But not like this.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.104
Just for tonight.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.241
Get your bearings, son.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.909
Listen to him.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.078
He's right.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.046
Go.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.316
Or go for good.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.817
(Sighs)

10:52.819 --> 10:54.219
What?

10:54.221 --> 10:56.855
I'm not asking.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.123
We got this.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.963
(Breathing heavily)

11:04.965 --> 11:06.998
Sorry, Tess. We've got friends

11:07.000 --> 11:08.867
surveilling possible hideouts

11:08.869 --> 11:10.935
from Brussels to Turkey, all
the way to the Russian border.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.454
Officer kohl,

11:12.455 --> 11:13.972
we're way past surveillance
at this point.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.042
You want kort taken
dead or alive?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.977
We'd actually prefer
if you tagged him

11:18.979 --> 11:20.812
and released back into the wild.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.081
No need for sarcasm, MI6.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.316
Just a little bit jet-lagged,
interpol.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.418
Find him.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.855
What, Monroe?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.257
Well, I'm just wondering,

11:32.259 --> 11:33.858
maybe kort's not
over there at all.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.961
What if he's still here?

11:36.963 --> 11:38.129
And he outsourced the hit?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.431
McGee said he was smart.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.032
Smart enough to
keep his hands clean?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.168
Assassins for hire everywhere.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.703
Out to make a quick dollar.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.871
We find our killer,
we find kort.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.206
Yeah, but how?

11:49.109 --> 11:50.725
NSA chatter.

11:50.726 --> 11:52.342
Yeah, kort and anything
to do with Israel.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.013
On it, and I'll check
for wire transfers, too.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.040
Gibbs:
Congratulations.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.109
You're now a journeyman agent.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.177
I will carry this
with tremendous pride.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.084
(Sighs heavily)

12:33.086 --> 12:34.085
You all right, boss?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.021
We need answers.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.324
You know, there's something
I've been thinking about

12:39.326 --> 12:41.392
a lot lately.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.496
Something you said to me
when you first hired me.

12:44.498 --> 12:47.365
Something I never forgot.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.068
You asked,

12:50.070 --> 12:52.303
"what happens when
the best agents in the world

12:52.305 --> 12:54.305
want to accomplish something?"

12:54.307 --> 12:56.808
"They get it done."

12:56.810 --> 13:00.111
Damn right they do.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.113
For fornell.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.482
For Ziva.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.785
We'll get it done.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.556
Bishop: NSA confirmed it
through CIA and homeland.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.992
Breadcrumb trail points
to kort hiring

13:13.994 --> 13:15.293
this man to do the bombing.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.895
Clayton:
Ghazi farsoun.

13:16.897 --> 13:17.962
I know him.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.398
Palestinian.
Jack of all trades.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
How much did kort pay him
to take out the farmhouse?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.935
30,000.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.236
We believe this is the wire,

13:25.238 --> 13:27.072
though the names
involved are fake.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.907
That's a bargain
on the black market.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.175
Where'd the transfer come from?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.376
D.C.-based bank.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.211
(Scoffs)
Son of a bitch.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.879
He never left.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.148
I knew it, kort's been
in the states the entire time.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.884
Question is,
where's he hiding?

13:39.886 --> 13:41.519
Tony, what are you doing here?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.388
Director called me in.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.223
Tony, I'm so sorry.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.858
I wish there was
something I could say.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.226
Thank you, bishop.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.062
Tess, did you say
that Trent kort is here?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.263
Looks that way.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.399
Where's Gibbs? Does he know?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.434
Upstairs. He knows.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.269
(Sighs):
Okay.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.138
McGee, catch me up after.
I want in.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.941
You got it.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.010
Vance:
Agent DiNozzo.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.245
Come in.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.249
You remember
Mossad director elbaz.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.017
Orli.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.854
Yes, this is no time
for formality.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.188
It's good to see you, Tony,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.290
despite the sad circumstance.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.558
Yeah.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.393
Tell me you got who did this.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.396
First, let me say
how very sorry I am.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.866
This is profound
for so many people,

14:27.868 --> 14:29.267
myself included.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.770
That's interesting.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.272
From what I recall, you and Ziva
weren't exactly bffs.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.040
Something about you
running off with her father.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.308
Agent DiNozzo.

14:37.310 --> 14:41.179
Ziva and I mended many fences
in recent years.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.382
I came to consider her
a dear friend, and I know

14:44.384 --> 14:46.017
she would say the same.
Friends don't let friends

14:46.019 --> 14:47.185
get hit by mortar fire.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.953
We had no way of knowing.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.955
You're Mossad,
you know everything.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.091
Including the fact

14:53.093 --> 14:56.094
that kort never left
the United States.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.529
We confirmed that Trent kort
was behind the attacks,

14:58.531 --> 15:00.598
hiring farsoun to destroy

15:00.600 --> 15:02.567
Eli David's private file.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.202
Ziva was...

15:04.204 --> 15:07.305
An unexpected
and unfortunate casualty.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.140
And you're sure?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.342
You haven't even finished
sorting through the rubble.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.011
Where is farsoun now?

15:13.013 --> 15:15.413
Every effort is being made
to hunt him down, agent Gibbs,

15:15.415 --> 15:16.948
believe me.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.249
I'd believe you
if you were still

15:18.251 --> 15:20.385
back in Israel searching,

15:20.387 --> 15:23.254
instead of standing here
telling us how sorry you are.

15:23.256 --> 15:28.026
Actually, I am here for
a much more important reason.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.995
Something
far more personal.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.597
Bring in tali.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.300
Wasn't that Ziva's sister?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.168
Her namesake, yes.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.670
Whose namesake?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.705
You may have heard
there was one survivor

15:40.707 --> 15:42.941
pulled from the farmhouse.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.544
Her room was in a corridor
not destroyed by the fire.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.445
(Door opens)

15:51.451 --> 15:53.651
Tali...

15:53.653 --> 15:55.553
Is Ziva's daughter.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.525
And your daughter, Tony.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.308
Orli:
Poor tali.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.410
She cried throughout
the flight,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.346
enduring more in her last day

16:21.348 --> 16:24.315
than most people do
in a lifetime.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.751
Tony:
Does she even know?

16:26.753 --> 16:29.320
I mean, does she understand?

16:29.322 --> 16:32.156
All she knows is that her mother
has gone away.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.192
(Sighs)
Ziva assured me

16:34.194 --> 16:37.495
you were the only
biological possibility,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.197
in case you were wondering.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.500
I wasn't.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.235
But if she had any doubts,

16:44.237 --> 16:46.137
that would explain
why she didn't...

16:46.139 --> 16:47.405
Tell me.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.607
No doubts.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.043
Yes, she's the image
of her mother,

16:52.045 --> 16:55.413
but the eyes are all you, Tony.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.515
If I'd known she was pregnant,
(Scoffs)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.017
I would've been there
in a second.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.085
Which is precisely
why she didn't tell you.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.453
She didn't want
to disrupt your life

17:02.455 --> 17:03.688
any more than she already had.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.057
That was not her decision
to make.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.426
You know better than anyone

17:08.428 --> 17:10.461
how fiercely
independent Ziva was.

17:10.463 --> 17:14.399
She did not need
a man to complete her.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.501
She was quite comfortable
and confident

17:16.503 --> 17:18.503
raising tali on her own.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.772
Without ever telling me.

17:20.774 --> 17:23.408
Actually, she came
to regret that decision

17:23.410 --> 17:26.210
as tali grew,
but she struggled

17:26.212 --> 17:27.578
with how to break the news.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.082
She didn't... she knew
you wouldn't be pleased.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.420
Then she never knew me at all.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.488
(Footsteps approaching)

17:43.229 --> 17:45.430
Is it true?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.834
Can we see her?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.772
What do you got, duck?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.107
Nothing, Jethro.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.409
<i> Nada. Naught. Niente.</i>

17:58.411 --> 18:00.344
Not a bloody thing

18:00.346 --> 18:01.712
on terdei's body

18:01.714 --> 18:04.415
to indicate the whereabouts
of Trent kort.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.150
Let's hope
that Abby fairs better

18:06.152 --> 18:08.119
with the clothing and bullets.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.620
Okay.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.855
You all right?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.157
Are any of us?

18:13.159 --> 18:15.827
I mean,
it's information overload.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.162
One could pull a muscle
trying to digest it.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.298
First, Ziva.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
And now a child.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.802
Not a typical day.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.538
Is that really
all you have to say?

18:29.175 --> 18:30.508
Keep your eye on the ball, duck.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.742
Jethro, I know

18:31.744 --> 18:33.811
that Trent kort
is our primary goal,

18:33.813 --> 18:36.280
but we cannot lose sight
of Anthony

18:36.282 --> 18:37.548
and the enormity

18:37.550 --> 18:39.283
of what
he's going through.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.384
We're not.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.220
Good.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.522
Family first, Jethro.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.203
Great kid.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.672
If she's as much like
her mom as you say,

19:01.674 --> 19:03.541
I wish I'd met Diane.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.177
Oh, you two together? (Laughs)

19:06.179 --> 19:07.578
That's a scary thought.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.715
What about you, popeye?

19:10.717 --> 19:11.782
What about me?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.818
Well, lots of curve balls.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.320
Fornell is like
a brother to you.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.856
How does it feel
almost losing him?

19:20.560 --> 19:24.462
And then you have
this former agent, David, is it?

19:24.464 --> 19:27.565
DiNozzo loses a love,
gains a child.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.267
That's got to
make you feel...

19:29.269 --> 19:31.903
(Scoffs) What?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.408
I can't believe I have
to resort to this. Um....

19:38.444 --> 19:41.479
Nod if I get anywhere close.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.581
Sad, mad,

19:43.583 --> 19:46.317
happy, scared.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.585
Sure.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.188
Sure, what?
To which feeling?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.422
One of them?
All of them?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.857
It's not the same.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.258
I-i don't...

19:54.260 --> 19:55.593
You don't what?
I-i don't...

19:55.595 --> 19:56.928
You can say it.
(Clears throat)

19:56.930 --> 19:58.529
You can say it, Gibbs.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.598
(Phone rings)

20:02.402 --> 20:04.202
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.436
Yeah, Abbs.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.804
Uh, yeah. Right there.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.740
What's not the same? Tell me.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.942
Tell me.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.510
Nothing.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.346
I gotta go. Thank you.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.615
Mm-hmm.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.517
Let's run to the couch.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.920
Run, run, run, run, run, oh.
(Laughs)

20:22.922 --> 20:26.624
The old man you were
with before, that's senior.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.893
He'll be back from the market
in a little while.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.428
Until then, we just...

20:30.430 --> 20:32.597
Ooh, hey, I got one.
All right.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.665
(Blows)

20:37.537 --> 20:39.570
One...

20:39.572 --> 20:41.606
Two... three.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.943
Do you see it?
Oh, here's it coming!

20:45.945 --> 20:47.545
It's coming back down to us.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.247
(Quiet scream, whooshing)

20:49.249 --> 20:50.581
Okay.

20:51.784 --> 20:52.650
(Sighs)

20:52.652 --> 20:54.352
All right.
Keh-lev.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.353
What's that?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.954
Keh-lev.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.489
Keh-lev... I don't know.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.658
Keh-lev, keh-lev.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.993
Okay. Okay. Shh.
Keh-lev, keh-lev.

21:01.995 --> 21:05.029
It's okay. It's okay.
Keh-lev, huh?
Keh-lev.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.500
Is it this?

21:09.502 --> 21:10.768
Keh-lev.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.671
Keh-lev is your doggy.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.776
(Sighs)
Well...

21:18.778 --> 21:21.512
Thank god
for the go-bag, right?

21:21.514 --> 21:23.714
Well, your mom always packed

21:23.716 --> 21:25.583
a go-bag.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.528
Tony, you are so...

21:37.530 --> 21:39.964
(Sighs) Loved.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.544
I lost my little sister tali

21:53.546 --> 21:55.613
in a Hamas suicide bombing.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.653
Gibbs:
What's going on, Abbs?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.389
Clayton is
a renaissance man, Gibbs.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.724
Hobbyist, really.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.327
Minor in science at
the university of Birmingham.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.495
Mostly in it
for the smart women.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.630
Abby: Um, don't worry

22:12.632 --> 22:13.597
about the radioactivity.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.933
It's at, like,
super low levels.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.335
Radioactivity? From what?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.637
This mud is
from kort's footprint

22:19.639 --> 22:21.072
that was found at your house.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.640
The techs scraped it up
the night that fornell was shot.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.375
Should I be worried?

22:24.377 --> 22:25.609
Clayton:
Again, super low levels.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.112
Nothing a mop
and soapy water won't fix.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.580
That tells us what?

22:29.582 --> 22:30.581
Well, it doesn't
tell you anything.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.450
It tells me that
we've got some bad

22:32.452 --> 22:34.552
nuclear juju going on here.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.953
It tested positive for isotopes.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.621
And what does that tell you?

22:37.623 --> 22:39.824
Well, if we can find
the source of the isotopes,

22:39.826 --> 22:41.692
it might be where kort
was exposed.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.728
And if we find
where kort was exposed...

22:43.730 --> 22:46.530
Then we find kort.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.475
McGee: Now these
are the nearest facilities

22:57.477 --> 22:58.943
handling nuclear material.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.511
Two in Virginia,
two in Maryland.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.579
Let's split them up.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.447
I'll take bauco point
in Maryland.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.482
I'll take feder power and water.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.516
Clayton:
Hold the phones.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.585
Isn't that what you people say?

23:07.587 --> 23:09.420
Or is it
"stop the presses"?
Keep talking, Reeves.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.755
These nuclear sites.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.456
We're assuming
kort's connected to one.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.891
Is or once was, yeah.

23:13.893 --> 23:14.992
Well, it just hit me.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.527
We might not have the scumbag,

23:16.529 --> 23:17.895
but we have
another common denominator.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.063
Someone we know connected

23:19.065 --> 23:20.965
to all of this.
Jacob Scott.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.466
Who's already told us
everything he knows.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.834
Why would he hold
out on us now?

23:23.836 --> 23:25.603
Maybe he doesn't know
he's holding out on us.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.171
Doesn't know all he knows.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.472
(Phone rings)

23:28.474 --> 23:29.640
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.076
Great. Great news.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.511
On my way.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.512
Get Jacob Scott in here.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.583
Let me know
when you got something.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.619
Look.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.654
So yummy. Yummy.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.025
Rough night?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.493
Yes.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.529
Aside from the screaming,

23:51.531 --> 23:53.464
tears, (Chuckles)

23:53.466 --> 23:54.698
Not to mention poor tali here.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.801
Oh, who's poor?

23:56.803 --> 23:59.537
All I see is happy tali.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.039
Smart tali. Strong tali.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.574
You got to keep
it positive, Tony.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.042
It really matters.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.710
Okay.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.779
Positive.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.682
She positively seems
to have no appetite.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.150
Well, would you?

24:13.152 --> 24:16.187
I mean, look at these
yucky jars here.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.855
No, you got to try

24:17.857 --> 24:19.623
these organic baked yams
that I brought over.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.226
They're packed with vitamin c,

24:22.228 --> 24:23.594
natural fibers.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.564
Mmm.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.065
Hmm.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.900
What are you doing
to my countertop?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.569
Child-proofing.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.704
Y-you know,
it never used to bother me,

24:33.706 --> 24:35.840
getting on a plane,
or driving a car,

24:35.842 --> 24:37.775
but now that I'm responsible
for another human being,

24:37.777 --> 24:40.845
I have become much more
safety conscious.

24:40.847 --> 24:44.048
And my job is not nearly
as dangerous as yours is.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.854
Hey, are you,
are you coming back to work?

24:49.856 --> 24:51.956
Of course I am.
Why wouldn't I?

24:51.958 --> 24:55.192
Oh, I don't know. I just...

24:55.194 --> 24:57.261
Y-you're a single dad now, Tony.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.263
And an agent
in the line of fire.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.131
Just wasn't sure
you'd want to juggle.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.567
Well, I've been juggling
my whole life, jimbo.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.236
That's great.

25:05.238 --> 25:06.770
You know,
as long as you're happy,

25:06.772 --> 25:08.606
I am a big believer

25:08.608 --> 25:11.142
in modeling happiness.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.677
Kids, they-they mirror so much
of what they see.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.679
In about ten years,
most likely,

25:15.681 --> 25:17.214
you'll have Gibbs' job,

25:17.216 --> 25:18.682
and then you'll be happy.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.151
And little tali here
will see that,

25:21.153 --> 25:23.721
and she's just gonna
follow your lead, aren't you?

25:23.723 --> 25:27.691
That's how
that works out, right?

25:28.961 --> 25:30.995
Did I die? This hell?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.763
I get a call telling me
you're awake,

25:32.765 --> 25:34.632
and I get all the way down here,

25:34.634 --> 25:35.766
and you're still sleeping.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.736
How rude of me.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.905
Kort.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.273
It was him.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.941
Yeah, we know.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.881
Tobias, you look awful.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.184
(Weak laughing)
Ow. Ow.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.853
I feel awful.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.656
Leg's numb.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.190
Can't move my arm.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.294
My head is like
ten hangovers.

26:03.296 --> 26:06.230
All that matters is you're back.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.566
You got a lot of work to do
to get better.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.703
What the hell?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.976
Watermelons.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.678
Em.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.912
Nice.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.950
(Door opens)

26:27.286 --> 26:28.686
Clayton:
Jacob Scott.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.620
Consider this your first

26:29.622 --> 26:31.622
official meal as a free man.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.223
Chips ain't half bad.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.825
Trent kort.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.594
How'd you like
to help us find him?

26:36.596 --> 26:38.829
If I knew where kort was,

26:38.831 --> 26:41.165
I'd have tried
to put him away myself.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.967
How'd you two first meet?

26:42.969 --> 26:45.235
It was so long ago.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.637
Through work, I suppose.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.140
The way you would anyone.

26:50.142 --> 26:54.678
Interagency between CIA, MI6.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.814
Do you recall
the last assignment?

26:56.816 --> 26:58.782
Well, countries
were rebuilding

26:58.784 --> 27:00.818
their defense systems
post 9/11.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.987
Exchanging top-secret intel.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.655
How'd you get yours?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.726
My contact
was a man named Edgar.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.060
Edgar what?

27:10.062 --> 27:11.662
Don't know.

27:11.664 --> 27:15.299
He was a-a nuke expert,
contracted by dod.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.835
Knew which countries
had nuclear capability,

27:17.837 --> 27:19.003
which didn't.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.838
Did he know kort?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.040
He's the one introduced us.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.142
Edgar was the brains.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.210
He knew everything.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.845
Any idea how to find him?

27:27.847 --> 27:29.980
If he's even alive

27:29.982 --> 27:31.215
or in the states.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.816
We never found him.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.984
Edgar found us.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.853
(Phone rings)

27:36.856 --> 27:38.389
Run a search
for nuclear engineers

27:38.391 --> 27:40.124
with the name Edgar.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.726
I think I can handle that.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.663
Enjoy your beltway burger.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.032
Tony:
Where are we with kort?

27:48.034 --> 27:50.267
Well, we might have
come upon his next target.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.169
A nuclear expert.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.238
Kort's into nukes now?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.939
Just following a lead.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.275
Well, that's a lead
I'm interested in.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.245
Call me when you're close.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.813
You know I will.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.915
We all want him.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.919
She looks just like her mother.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.889
What do you make of
all this, tali, huh?

28:11.891 --> 28:13.791
Daddy taking care of you?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.826
She doesn't know daddy.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.960
What do you mean?

28:16.962 --> 28:20.064
I just met her.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.732
And if Ziva never told me
about tali,

28:21.734 --> 28:24.301
maybe she never told tali
about me.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.771
Were you and Ziva
an item the whole time?

28:27.773 --> 28:30.107
Timothy farragut McGee,
how indiscreet.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.742
You know I would never
kiss and tell.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.377
Sure you would.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.080
We had a connection.

28:36.082 --> 28:39.817
And obviously,
a very fond farewell.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.087
(Scoffs)
That's unbelievable.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.323
I loved her, Tim.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.425
I know you did.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.893
(Phone rings)

28:52.298 --> 28:54.431
Yeah, Abby,
I'll be right there.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.899
Something on kort?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.067
Don't know yet.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.436
You'll call me?

28:59.438 --> 29:01.338
You know I will.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.010
McGee:
All right, what did you get...

29:07.012 --> 29:08.178
Clayton?

29:08.180 --> 29:09.947
Clayton is a smarty-pants.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.482
I thought
i was a renaissance man.

29:11.484 --> 29:12.950
Well, you're a
lot of things.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.485
Abby, why am I here?

29:14.487 --> 29:16.186
Turns out the isotope that
we found on Gibbs' floor,

29:16.188 --> 29:17.421
isn't traditional at all.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.922
It's experimental.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.290
Who was doing the experimenting?

29:20.793 --> 29:22.025
Clayton: Only one place.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.128
Pryor nuclear research facility.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.063
Kort must've gone there
to stake it out.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.197
Abby:
And look who one of their

29:27.199 --> 29:28.866
top researchers is.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.969
Dr. Edgar polk.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.303
That's our man.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.505
Kort's Edgar.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.913
NCIS. What do you have?

29:42.915 --> 29:44.815
Facility's on lockdown.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.050
Two workers shot.
One abducted by gunpoint.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.952
Who was taken?
I've been directed

29:48.954 --> 29:51.255
to withhold names until
the families have been notified.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.123
Yeah, well unless you want
to be reassigned

29:53.125 --> 29:55.325
to the local mall,
i would reconsider that.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.927
Is it Edgar polk?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.997
Do you know where they took him?

29:59.999 --> 30:01.198
You have security cameras?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.366
Yeah.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.538
That's kort.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.939
And he's got polk.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.107
Can you zoom in on their faces?

30:11.010 --> 30:12.910
Buddy of mine
taught me

30:12.912 --> 30:15.145
how to lip-read
across a crowded room.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.414
Bishop:
Okay.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.984
Edgar's saying something
about his son

30:20.986 --> 30:22.853
in chesapeake city.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.454
Could be where his files
are stashed.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.990
We're talking nuclear secrets
from all over the world.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.959
If kort gets
his hands on those...

30:28.961 --> 30:30.394
McGee, go find his son's place.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.933
(Sighs)

30:35.935 --> 30:37.000
Still think
you could have gotten away

30:37.002 --> 30:39.036
with "pretend tea", dad.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.438
I don't think
she would know the difference.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.207
But I would know, junior.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.242
What does daddy know

30:45.244 --> 30:46.577
about making tea, anyway?

30:46.579 --> 30:48.879
Please don't...
Just don't call me that.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.380
Why not?

30:50.382 --> 30:52.049
Embrace it, son.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.550
This kid is a DiNozzo

30:53.552 --> 30:55.419
all the way.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.989
It's been a long day,
and I need to take a shower.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.591
(Groans)

31:02.061 --> 31:03.360
Grab me a wipe

31:03.362 --> 31:04.928
out of her bag, will you?

31:04.930 --> 31:06.129
(Sighs)

31:08.968 --> 31:10.033
Thanks.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.910
Tony:
<i> Here we go. Hop on.</i>

31:19.912 --> 31:21.378
<i> Getting pretty good at this.</i>
<i> (Engine revving)</i>

31:25.117 --> 31:26.984
What's this?

31:26.986 --> 31:29.553
Oh, uh, I found that stuffed
in the side of her bag.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.655
I-i figured
you'd seen it before.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.124
Imah?

31:35.928 --> 31:38.595
Yeah, that's right, tali.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.997
Imah.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.399
W-what does that mean, "imah"?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.067
Hebrew.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.969
It means "mother", "mom".

31:45.971 --> 31:47.271
Oh.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.140
Aba.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.576
Tali, what did you say?

31:54.113 --> 31:56.380
Imah. Aba.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.449
Aba?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.686
Daddy.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.656
Ziva must have told her.

32:05.658 --> 32:08.292
She knows me.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.394
That's right, tali.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.932
You want to see something?

32:14.934 --> 32:17.701
You're gonna like this.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.537
Oh, yeah. Look.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.940
This was imah's.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.208
Imah's?
Imah's, yeah.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.544
Imah.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.149
Tony:
<i> This belonged</i>

32:32.151 --> 32:34.051
to imah,

32:34.053 --> 32:36.586
and now it's tali's.

32:36.588 --> 32:37.988
Come here.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.456
There you go.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.365
(Phone rings)

32:48.367 --> 32:49.967
McGee?

32:49.969 --> 32:52.002
Hey. You want kort,
here's your chance.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.070
You got him.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.404
We're about to.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.139
I'm gonna text you his location

32:56.141 --> 32:57.207
in chesapeake city.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.109
Wait for us
if you get there first.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.144
Are you sure he's there?

33:01.146 --> 33:02.112
Listen, Tony.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.248
You wanted him, we got him.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.085
I'm on my way.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.503
It's the 21st century, Edgar.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.706
There are places that will
digitize old files for you.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.175
Could've saved us the trouble.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.577
Live and learn.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.613
Pleasure working with you
back in the day.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.284
(Muffled shouts)

33:43.589 --> 33:45.022
(Tires squealing)

33:47.259 --> 33:48.392
Bishop:
Calling the fire department.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.393
Kort can't be far.

33:49.395 --> 33:50.727
Fan out. Take the back.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.530
Not waiting for Tony?
No. No. Move.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.799
Polk could still
be in here.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.640
(Coughing)

34:05.077 --> 34:06.710
(Grunting)

34:16.722 --> 34:18.488
No one to break us up this time.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.824
(Gunshots)

34:28.267 --> 34:30.400
Freeze!

34:43.515 --> 34:47.417
Old friends and new.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.653
But not the one I expected.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.188
Tony:
I'm here.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.460
DiNozzo.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.730
I had no idea
she'd be in the farmhouse.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.232
You know that.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.101
Do I?

35:04.103 --> 35:06.369
It was nothing personal.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.771
Strictly business.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.242
It is personal.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.144
It's Ziva.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.121
She was my family.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.255
Look who stopped by.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.693
You got something on your mind?

36:03.695 --> 36:06.463
Want to tell you
why I was late today.

36:06.465 --> 36:10.200
Well, you got there, DiNozzo.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.735
I don't need an explanation.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.371
I have one.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.806
A few months ago, you asked me

36:16.808 --> 36:18.708
what I really wanted.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.845
If I wanted to be
an agent anymore.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.914
Catch bad guys.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.917
(Chuckles)

36:26.919 --> 36:29.319
Now I know the answer.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.688
I had a feeling.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.390
The Gibbs gut.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.926
No. You.

36:35.928 --> 36:38.762
Seems to me,
you've known for a while.

36:38.764 --> 36:43.567
Only now, you've got
a daughter to think of.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.303
You can't only think
about yourself anymore.

36:46.305 --> 36:50.807
Evidently<i> we</i> have a daughter.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.443
Me and Ziva.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.379
Maybe she knew me
better than I thought.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.682
When McGee called,

36:58.684 --> 37:00.517
something hit me.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.419
I got this feeling,
something

37:02.421 --> 37:04.854
I'd never felt before.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.825
In that moment,
i didn't want Trent kort dead.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.896
All I wanted to do
was take care of tali.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.731
(Sighs)

37:14.733 --> 37:18.868
Everything that she had
in her life was gone.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.805
Mm-hmm. Except you.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.374
Except me.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.710
I'm it.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.379
I'm everything to
that little girl now.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.883
And I've never been
anybody's everything before.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.520
But you showed up.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.589
Yes, I did.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.424
In all kinds of ways.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.363
But that's it.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.864
I'm done now.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.666
I'm gonna take tali
to Israel,

37:49.668 --> 37:50.767
look for some answers.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.702
Then I'm going
to take her to Paris.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.904
Ziva loves Paris.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.675
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.777
And you gotta believe

38:00.779 --> 38:02.746
what you gotta believe.

38:02.748 --> 38:03.813
I'd say "thank you",

38:03.815 --> 38:06.483
but it doesn't quite
cover it, boss.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.392
You take care of yourself
and your family, DiNozzo.

38:15.394 --> 38:18.461
Copy that, boss.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.465
(Chuckles)

38:29.941 --> 38:32.842
Abbs. You're in early.

38:32.844 --> 38:33.977
Always.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.680
What's your excuse?
(Sighs)

38:36.682 --> 38:39.816
I've just got
a few things to take care of.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.453
Where's tali?

38:43.455 --> 38:44.954
Home.

38:44.956 --> 38:48.658
With... (Chuckles) Grandpa.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.961
Senior must be so happy.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.030
To put it mildly.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.871
Whoa. I've never
done that before.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.941
Hmm. How'd it feel?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.110
Empowering?

39:07.112 --> 39:08.912
(Chuckles)

39:08.914 --> 39:10.847
I just have something
i need to tell you

39:10.849 --> 39:12.982
before you go.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.718
How do you know I'm going?

39:14.720 --> 39:17.821
Because I'm Abby Sciuto,
and I know things.

39:17.823 --> 39:21.124
(Chuckles) Why did I ask?

39:21.126 --> 39:24.094
I know how much...

39:24.096 --> 39:27.397
Ziva...

39:27.399 --> 39:30.066
Really loved you.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.002
And I need to know

39:33.004 --> 39:35.705
that you know that, too.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.375
I do.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.676
I think.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.544
(Sighs)

39:41.546 --> 39:43.146
Don't think.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.049
Know.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.585
I know.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.920
She told me.

39:53.825 --> 39:57.026
I'm really gonna miss you,
Anthony DiNozzo.

40:00.665 --> 40:02.532
Not half as much

40:02.534 --> 40:05.969
as I'm going to miss you,
Abby Sciuto.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.908
<i> I am an NCIS special agent.</i>

40:11.910 --> 40:16.045
<i> My duty is to serve</i>
<i> and protect the United States,</i>

40:16.047 --> 40:19.516
<i> and our Navy and marine corps,</i>
<i> across global boundaries.</i>

40:19.518 --> 40:22.552
<i> I recognize my badge</i>
<i> is a symbol of authority</i>

40:22.554 --> 40:25.855
<i> and public trust.</i>

40:25.857 --> 40:27.457
<i> I will live my life</i>
<i> above reproach.</i>

40:27.459 --> 40:29.893
<i> Understanding my actions</i>

40:29.895 --> 40:31.961
<i> reflect upon</i>
<i> my fellow special agents</i>

40:31.963 --> 40:34.998
<i> and our agency.</i>

40:36.067 --> 40:37.167
Tony.

40:37.169 --> 40:39.736
Hey, guys.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.906
So Gibbs talked to us.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.041
You serious about this?

40:49.714 --> 40:52.015
I have five words for you.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.553
Very special agent
Timothy McGee.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.093
Eleanor bishop.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.863
You're a very good agent.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.131
But not nearly as good
as I think

41:08.133 --> 41:10.500
you one day will be.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.837
Take care of yourself.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.108
Where are you going first, Tony?

41:19.110 --> 41:21.110
Well...

41:21.112 --> 41:23.079
I'm going home

41:23.081 --> 41:24.914
to see tali.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.271
The MI6 director wants
a debrief in MTAC later.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.039
Lots to explain.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.141
Multiple agencies.
Plenty of paperwork.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.544
All about
international teamwork.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.713
Happy to help.
Director can be
a little bit tricky.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.281
So I wouldn't mind
some back-up.
Bishop: Okay.

41:58.283 --> 42:01.150
I'm in.
Me, too.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.151
Yeah, you got it.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.186
Listen up.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.623
Grab your gear.
