00:14.799 --> 00:16.867
I've always worried where
your loyalty stands, Marcus.

00:31.416 --> 00:32.383
I'm fucking pregnant.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.419
I am officially off the market.

00:36.121 --> 00:37.255
Coco's gone,

Oh, brother. Always
the steep and thorny path.

BISHOP:
This three king bullshit
doesn't work

00:51.602 --> 00:53.438
if Ramos and Canche aren't
stepping down.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.740
I want you to double the heroin

00:55.773 --> 00:57.808
Make up for the profit loss.

while we ice out
Ramos and Canche

01:10.321 --> 01:12.757
-and give Bishop the throne.
-It's a solid plan.

01:12.790 --> 01:15.260
We're in a bad fucking spot.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.666
I want to bring this M.C.

-Just talked to Solis.

01:58.169 --> 01:59.170
Canche's dead.

02:00.171 --> 02:01.639
The terror you caused my family,

what you did to my baby brother.

17:52.289 --> 17:55.159
-(clamoring continues)
-Come on! Come on!

18:00.164 --> 18:02.932
(groaning)

18:02.966 --> 18:05.169
-(gunfire)
-(grunts)

18:15.212 --> 18:17.147
I got you, brother.

18:20.817 --> 18:22.819
*

18:24.321 --> 18:26.290
(clamoring)

18:26.323 --> 18:29.125
Push, push, push!

18:29.159 --> 18:31.161
(thunder rumbling)

18:36.333 --> 18:40.470
* Sittin' high
in the midnight rain... *

18:40.504 --> 18:42.872
You should've stayed
at your house with that chick.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.176
Hope.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.478
Her name's Hope.

18:48.512 --> 18:51.381
* Just wondering
where you've gone... *

18:51.415 --> 18:53.817
Got to get right with Bish.

18:53.850 --> 18:56.019
Got to get right with the club.

18:57.854 --> 19:00.023
Roger that.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.160
What the fuck?

19:04.194 --> 19:06.863
* I was just born to lose. *

19:06.896 --> 19:08.232
-Shit!
-Fuck!

19:10.367 --> 19:13.002
(gunfire continues)

19:13.036 --> 19:14.238
Go, go, go.

19:14.271 --> 19:16.240
Fuck!

19:16.273 --> 19:19.343
What the fuck? Was that Franco?

19:19.376 --> 19:21.378
-Man, fuck Franco.
-(gunfire continues)

19:26.883 --> 19:28.352
They're hitting the clubhouse.

19:28.385 --> 19:30.854
The fuck did you guys do?

19:30.887 --> 19:32.922
We blew up Yuma.

19:32.956 --> 19:34.424
All of them?

19:36.560 --> 19:39.028
Not all of them.

19:39.062 --> 19:41.398
Fuck!

19:41.431 --> 19:43.300
We got to get to the guys.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.436
But first got to get
to the van with the guns.

19:46.470 --> 19:47.771
Half our ammunition's in there.

19:47.804 --> 19:50.039
-I'll cover you.
-No, no, I'll cover you.

19:50.073 --> 19:51.608
Motherfucker,
I just saved your ass

19:51.641 --> 19:53.209
from a tribe of crackhead
murder hippies.

19:53.243 --> 19:54.210
Go.

19:54.244 --> 19:55.479
Fuck!

20:02.085 --> 20:03.152
Open it.

20:05.755 --> 20:08.057
* Well, it don't matter where
the old wind blows *

20:08.091 --> 20:10.294
* Ain't nobody gonna
tell me no *

20:10.327 --> 20:14.130
* Lay my head where
the trouble don't go *

20:14.163 --> 20:16.400
* Take a little time *

20:16.433 --> 20:18.435
* To lighten my load... *

20:31.114 --> 20:34.318
Oh. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

20:34.351 --> 20:37.120
-Shit!
-Let's go! Go, go, go!

20:37.153 --> 20:38.955
(gunfire)

20:46.663 --> 20:48.965
(distant explosion)

20:48.998 --> 20:50.800
What the fuck was that?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.936
Stop wasting ammo.

20:52.969 --> 20:54.704
Only shoot when you have to.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.308
(lighter flicking)

21:03.012 --> 21:05.815
I don't think I can do this.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.051
Fucking burn it, please.

21:09.319 --> 21:11.388
I don't want to bleed out.

21:16.059 --> 21:18.795
-(skin sizzles)
-(cries out)

21:18.828 --> 21:20.364
How close are we?

21:20.397 --> 21:22.031
Don't know.

21:22.065 --> 21:23.833
(grunts)
It won't fucking start.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.669
-BISHOP: Well, fucking come on.
-Fuck.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.205
Get the fuck out of the way.

21:29.238 --> 21:31.140
Give me the light.
Give me the light.

21:31.174 --> 21:32.542
-(gunfire)
-ANGEL: Hey!

21:32.576 --> 21:33.710
They're getting closer.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.548
Let them fucking come.

21:38.582 --> 21:40.249
Watch the fucking gas.

21:41.585 --> 21:43.353
Let's try that.

21:47.524 --> 21:48.858
Come on.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.394
(generator starts)

21:50.427 --> 21:52.396
-All right. Let's go.
-Get up. Go.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.369
(grunts)

22:03.873 --> 22:05.542
-Got it?
-Yeah.

22:07.210 --> 22:08.912
On my count,
you kick those fuckers on.

22:11.047 --> 22:12.949
One.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.920
Two.

22:16.953 --> 22:19.689
-(door opens)
-NAILS: Rosa!

22:19.723 --> 22:22.191
ROSA:
I'm not with them!

22:22.225 --> 22:23.393
I'm not with them!

22:23.427 --> 22:25.395
-(gunfire)
-(screams)

22:25.429 --> 22:27.731
(cries, screams)

22:27.764 --> 22:29.566
No!

22:29.599 --> 22:30.767
TAZA:
I warned you.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.436
I fucking warned all of you.

22:32.469 --> 22:34.538
Shut the fuck up.

22:34.571 --> 22:36.740
You're the last motherfucker
I want to hear from right now.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.409
You had your chance
to shut me up.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.044
Everyone shut the fuck up.

22:41.077 --> 22:42.378
ANGEL:
What?

22:42.412 --> 22:43.713
Shh! Shut up.

22:43.747 --> 22:45.582
(creaking overhead)

22:45.615 --> 22:47.451
Listen.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.599
(creaking continues)

23:02.632 --> 23:04.634
*

23:07.971 --> 23:10.006
They're on the fucking roof.

23:14.778 --> 23:17.313
(creaking continues)

23:24.688 --> 23:26.289
(bottle clinks on floor)

23:33.863 --> 23:35.465
(creaking)

23:46.209 --> 23:48.478
Lights off.

24:05.161 --> 24:07.163
*

24:10.667 --> 24:12.636
Get that fucking light
out of my eyes.

24:12.669 --> 24:13.637
Fuck!

24:13.670 --> 24:15.639
Fucking idea
how close you just came?

24:15.672 --> 24:17.473
Fucking Franco just tried
to ventilate us.

24:17.507 --> 24:19.375
-(Gilly coughing)
-Who the fuck is that?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.178
-It's Rabbit.
-Fuck.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.479
How'd you get past them?

24:23.513 --> 24:24.648
GILLY:
Boy Scout's trailer,

24:24.681 --> 24:26.015
hopped the wall.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.684
They got you flanked,
so we went around back.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.152
JESS:
They're almost to the steps!

24:29.185 --> 24:30.520
EZ:
Shit.

24:32.522 --> 24:33.890
(generator starts)

24:36.359 --> 24:37.527
Go.

24:39.929 --> 24:41.698
(gunfire)

24:53.109 --> 24:54.744
(clicks empty)

24:57.781 --> 24:59.215
(guns clicking)

24:59.248 --> 25:00.884
Fuck.

25:03.052 --> 25:06.556
Come fucking get it.
Come fucking get it!

25:11.761 --> 25:13.763
-(screaming)
-(gunfire)

25:23.439 --> 25:25.441
(screaming and gunfire continue)

25:31.581 --> 25:33.049
I'm out!

25:33.082 --> 25:34.818
Me, too.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.922
Bish, what's the plan?

25:39.923 --> 25:41.758
(inhales sharply)

25:47.296 --> 25:48.898
What's the fucking plan?

25:48.932 --> 25:50.133
We die.

25:54.170 --> 25:57.741
You want to know why
we're fucking here right now?!

25:57.774 --> 25:59.242
Do you want to fucking know why?

25:59.275 --> 26:01.410
Hey! Will you two just
fucking stop?

26:01.444 --> 26:03.279
I ain't trying to die today!

26:03.312 --> 26:04.981
Fuck.

26:05.014 --> 26:07.617
I got too much
to fucking live for!

26:10.854 --> 26:14.523
I got too much
to fucking die for.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.294
Pres!

26:24.033 --> 26:26.169
What are we gonna do?

26:30.306 --> 26:32.475
(Rosa screaming in distance)

26:37.681 --> 26:39.515
I don't know.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.008
You don't know?

27:06.009 --> 27:08.144
(generator sputters)

27:08.177 --> 27:10.714
HANK:
Hey.

27:10.747 --> 27:12.849
The sun's coming up.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.384
Lights won't mean shit soon.

27:15.418 --> 27:17.486
(Rosa screaming in distance)

27:17.520 --> 27:20.056
Will she just shut the fuck up?

27:20.089 --> 27:22.491
You shut the fuck up.

27:22.525 --> 27:24.260
She's dying.

27:29.365 --> 27:31.267
COCO:
Fuck these motherfuckers.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.870
This is our club.

27:35.104 --> 27:38.341
This is all we fucking got.

27:38.374 --> 27:39.743
And fuck any one of you

27:39.776 --> 27:41.344
who thinks we should give
this shit up.

27:41.377 --> 27:42.445
Where the fuck were you?

27:44.547 --> 27:46.115
Where the fuck were you both?

27:48.051 --> 27:50.353
COCO:
That's on me, Bish.

27:50.386 --> 27:53.122
I know I ain't been around,
and I got to answer up for that.

27:57.393 --> 27:59.763
M-My kid, she's been fucking up.

28:01.064 --> 28:02.598
She got in some trouble.

28:05.134 --> 28:07.536
(stammers) And I know
I should've come to the club,

28:07.570 --> 28:09.305
I know I should've came
to my brothers.

28:11.407 --> 28:13.576
But Gilly, tonight...

28:13.609 --> 28:15.378
he helped me out,
he helped save her.

28:15.411 --> 28:16.712
Bro, you should've told us.
Man, we would've...

28:16.746 --> 28:18.047
That shit's done!

28:18.081 --> 28:19.448
It's done now!

28:19.482 --> 28:21.250
No, it ain't fucking done!

28:22.986 --> 28:25.488
You fucking better believe
this shit ain't fucking done.

28:28.491 --> 28:33.729
CANCHE (singsongy):
EZ! EZ!

28:33.763 --> 28:36.299
I fucking saw you!

28:36.332 --> 28:40.569
You fucking missed!
Now you're gonna fucking die!

28:40.603 --> 28:42.605
MEN (chanting):
Mayans!

28:42.638 --> 28:45.408
Mayans! Mayans!

28:45.441 --> 28:48.411
Mayans!
Mayans!

28:48.444 --> 28:50.980
Mayans! Mayans!

28:51.014 --> 28:52.448
Mayans!

28:52.481 --> 28:55.251
Mayans! Mayans!

28:55.284 --> 28:59.255
Mayans! Mayans! Mayans!

28:59.288 --> 29:01.925
Mayans! Mayans!

29:01.958 --> 29:06.129
Mayans! Mayans! Mayans!

29:06.162 --> 29:10.433
Mayans! Mayans!
Mayans!

29:10.466 --> 29:13.937
Mayans! Mayans! Mayans!

29:13.970 --> 29:15.171
Mayans!

29:15.204 --> 29:18.141
Mayans! Mayans!

29:23.346 --> 29:27.483
MEN (chanting):

(chanting continues)

29:44.200 --> 29:46.135
(sighs)

29:46.169 --> 29:48.537
If they come through that door,
I don't know what they'll do.

29:50.506 --> 29:53.676
(breathing heavily)

29:53.709 --> 29:55.344
If we get through this...

29:55.378 --> 29:56.980
Hey, no. (sniffles)

29:57.013 --> 29:58.381
We're gonna get through this.

29:58.414 --> 30:00.216
No.

30:00.249 --> 30:02.651
If we get through this...

30:02.685 --> 30:03.887
(Nails whimpers)

30:03.920 --> 30:05.554
-I promise...
-(sobs)

30:05.588 --> 30:08.191
Listen, look at me.

30:08.224 --> 30:12.528
Nothing will ever tear me away
from you or the baby.

30:16.532 --> 30:18.067
Okay.

30:20.536 --> 30:22.538
(sniffles, sighs)

30:31.547 --> 30:33.049
Take this.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.385
There's one bullet left.

30:38.387 --> 30:40.689
Don't let them hurt you.

30:40.723 --> 30:42.391
No.

30:45.294 --> 30:46.729
No.

30:47.730 --> 30:49.565
I won't be able to do it.

30:52.902 --> 30:54.603
Look, they got to get through me
first, but...

30:57.073 --> 30:58.908
Don't let them hurt the baby.

31:04.580 --> 31:06.582
(sobbing)

31:10.286 --> 31:12.588
(crying):
No.

31:19.495 --> 31:21.664
(takes deep breath)

31:42.986 --> 31:45.021
(line ringing)

31:52.795 --> 31:54.297
Hey.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.802
No, nothing's wrong.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.670
I knew you'd be up.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.345
I-I need you to call
the landlord tomorrow.

32:10.813 --> 32:13.816
Have him come by
and fix the back step.

32:15.818 --> 32:18.487
You're gonna fall, Ma.

32:23.993 --> 32:25.828
And what if I'm not there?

32:29.832 --> 32:31.900
You won't be bothering him.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.072
Call him today.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.243
Please.

32:43.679 --> 32:44.847
Good.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.359
(takes deep breath)

32:56.392 --> 32:58.727
(chuckles)

32:58.761 --> 33:00.363
Me, too.

33:06.202 --> 33:08.737
(sighs)

33:12.275 --> 33:14.277
(labored breathing)

33:32.395 --> 33:34.397
(labored breathing)

33:40.636 --> 33:42.638
*

33:51.914 --> 33:53.916
*

34:12.801 --> 34:14.803
*

34:27.983 --> 34:30.619
(gun clicking)

34:41.630 --> 34:43.632
(takes deep breath)

34:47.803 --> 34:49.538
Bishop?

34:52.341 --> 34:53.876
What are we doing?

34:58.547 --> 35:00.316
What's the plan?

35:05.888 --> 35:07.823
The plan is fuck you.

35:13.396 --> 35:15.198
First one comes
through that door

35:15.231 --> 35:17.466
gets a bullet in his face.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.168
And the next one?

35:19.202 --> 35:21.504
Yeah. That motherfucker, too.

35:23.005 --> 35:24.707
And everyone after him.

35:26.742 --> 35:29.011
We've got enough ammo
to take out what?

35:31.046 --> 35:33.316
Less than a dozen?

35:33.349 --> 35:35.651
Way you motherfuckers shoot,
maybe five.

35:35.684 --> 35:38.187
Shit, I won't miss.

35:40.022 --> 35:42.258
What about the other 50
fucking dudes out there?

35:43.692 --> 35:46.362
This is what
you fucking signed up for.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.696
What about them?

35:52.568 --> 35:54.937
My brother...

35:56.038 --> 35:57.340
...is about to have a kid.

35:57.373 --> 35:59.508
That engagement makes sense now.

35:59.542 --> 36:01.210
ANGEL:
Fuck you.

36:05.881 --> 36:07.883
EZ:
What about their baby?

36:12.221 --> 36:14.457
Do we ask him
to pay the price for our sins?

36:15.458 --> 36:17.460
(rain pattering)

36:38.914 --> 36:40.716
Canche!

36:40.749 --> 36:42.418
What the fuck are you doing?

36:45.921 --> 36:47.556
Canche, I'm coming out!

36:47.590 --> 36:48.957
Fuck you are.

36:48.991 --> 36:51.059
EZ:
I'm the one you want!

36:51.093 --> 36:52.227
EZ, what are you doing?

36:52.261 --> 36:54.730
But you got to
let everyone else go!

36:54.763 --> 36:58.301
CANCHE:
You got no fucking leverage,
motherfucker!

36:58.334 --> 37:00.569
I'll fucking kill you
and everyone inside!

37:00.603 --> 37:02.905
We got innocent people in here!

37:02.938 --> 37:05.608
CANCHE:
My son was innocent!

37:05.641 --> 37:07.810
So let me pay the price!

37:10.279 --> 37:12.315
It was my idea!

37:12.348 --> 37:14.783
All of it!

37:14.817 --> 37:17.286
I pressed that trigger!

37:24.493 --> 37:28.331
We still have enough firepower
to do damage!

37:34.637 --> 37:36.972
And we're all brothers.

37:43.312 --> 37:45.814
Let my blood be the last!

37:45.848 --> 37:48.351
-EZ, don't you go out
that fucking door.
-(crying): No!

37:54.690 --> 37:57.059
Canche, I'm coming out!

38:02.365 --> 38:04.367
(broken glass crunching)

38:09.204 --> 38:11.206
*

38:26.889 --> 38:28.891
*

38:39.201 --> 38:41.203
*

38:52.415 --> 38:54.717
*

39:15.471 --> 39:16.939
You want me?!

39:21.744 --> 39:23.245
Here I fucking am.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.918
But you let everyone else go.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.620
(door opens)

39:31.654 --> 39:33.221
NAILS (crying):
Please don't leave!

39:33.255 --> 39:35.924
Angel, please!
Don't do this!

39:59.448 --> 40:01.450
*

40:17.165 --> 40:19.167
*

40:35.183 --> 40:38.020
Isn't this fucking quaint?

40:38.053 --> 40:39.387
(grunts)

40:44.660 --> 40:46.662
(men grunting)

41:00.242 --> 41:02.010
CANCHE:
You fucking come at me?

41:07.683 --> 41:09.685
At my fucking kid?

41:15.390 --> 41:17.192
My boy?

41:20.696 --> 41:22.998
He was looking at me.

41:23.031 --> 41:24.733
At the blast.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.370
His sight...

41:30.873 --> 41:35.210
They don't know
how much he'll get back.

41:40.949 --> 41:42.785
Maybe that was a good thing.

41:45.588 --> 41:49.091
He didn't have to watch
Big Paul crawl

41:49.124 --> 41:52.027
across the floor with...

41:52.060 --> 41:54.797
his lower body gone.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.102
While you ran off
like a fucking coward!

42:00.135 --> 42:02.237
-Hey!
-Stay the fuck down.

42:04.239 --> 42:05.741
They were your brothers!

42:06.742 --> 42:09.411
Your fucking brothers!

42:15.651 --> 42:17.753
Tommy, Ganso, Indio.

42:24.593 --> 42:26.762
Did you celebrate?

42:30.465 --> 42:33.268
Did you celebrate
while they picked up

42:33.301 --> 42:36.338
the pieces of their bodies?

42:40.275 --> 42:41.910
(chuckles softly)

42:41.944 --> 42:45.447
'Cause we celebrated Ibarra.

42:47.783 --> 42:51.253
And now, his old lady's gonna
need to get him a closed casket,

42:51.286 --> 42:53.956
as will all of yours.

42:58.460 --> 43:00.763
COCO:
Fuck!

43:00.796 --> 43:02.597
-Fuck! Ah!
-What the fuck?

43:02.631 --> 43:04.499
-Hold him.
-(stammers) Fuck!

43:04.532 --> 43:05.801
Get the fuck off me!

43:05.834 --> 43:07.636
(panting)

43:20.515 --> 43:22.851
Ramos was our brother.

43:25.654 --> 43:29.958
He only wanted what was best
for the club,

43:29.992 --> 43:32.360
and you shot him in the face.

43:33.395 --> 43:35.397
You're rabid animals.

43:37.399 --> 43:39.234
You need to be put down.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.243
Fucking do it.

43:53.415 --> 43:55.217
(groans)

43:55.250 --> 43:57.886
You came at my family.

44:00.522 --> 44:02.858
Now I come after yours.

44:02.891 --> 44:04.993
(groans)

44:05.027 --> 44:07.195
-Look at him.
-No.

44:07.229 --> 44:08.663
Look at him!

44:08.697 --> 44:10.866
(panting)

44:15.237 --> 44:17.039
(EZ grunts)

44:19.041 --> 44:21.176
(sobbing)

44:21.209 --> 44:22.577
-(gunshot)
-(cries out)

44:22.610 --> 44:24.046
(body thuds)

44:28.083 --> 44:30.085
(cries out)

44:48.270 --> 44:50.405
ALVAREZ:
What have you done?

44:54.309 --> 44:57.079
You're gonna point a gun
at my primo, ése?

44:58.446 --> 45:00.749
You're gonna point a gun at me,
motherfucker?

45:08.090 --> 45:10.425
What have you done, Canche?

45:10.458 --> 45:13.762
CANCHE:
Marcus, we didn't start this.

45:14.763 --> 45:16.431
We didn't start this.

45:29.111 --> 45:31.279
What have you done, primo?

45:33.115 --> 45:35.283
This is my fucking club.

45:37.853 --> 45:41.489
You fucking hear me?
You fucking hear me?!

45:42.624 --> 45:44.459
This is my fucking club!

46:43.351 --> 46:45.253
(baby laughing)
