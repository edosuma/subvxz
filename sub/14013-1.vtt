00:23.123 --> 00:25.148
<i>In the criminal
justice system,</i>

00:25.225 --> 00:29.127
<i>the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups:</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:30.992
<i>The police
who investigate crime,</i>

00:31.064 --> 00:33.862
<i>and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:33.933 --> 00:35.662
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:39.239 --> 00:41.833
Whatever it costs, my kids
are going to Catholic school.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.034
You're a Baptist.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.669
I don't care. Those nuns
know how to build character.

00:45.745 --> 00:46.734
Here you go, sweetheart.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.610
You're sure that's
very light, no sugar?

00:48.681 --> 00:49.670
That's what you told me.

00:49.749 --> 00:50.773
It has to be very light.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.977
You let go,
it'll float in the air.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.553
Oh, man. Sometimes I want to
forget I'm married, I swear.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.854
You just like her 'cause
her features are white.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.689
Oh, yeah. That's why
I like you so much.

01:01.761 --> 01:02.728
Oh!

01:02.796 --> 01:04.730
Anything with your coffee,
gentlemen?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.390
Dd

01:17.343 --> 01:18.674
Mr. Decker?

01:36.596 --> 01:37.858
Hello.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.265
Mr. Decker?

01:43.703 --> 01:45.136
Mr. Decker?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.222
Looks like an invited guest.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.220
The door was open,

02:09.294 --> 02:10.785
there was no sign
of forced entry.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.925
My dad said, "Be a cop,
look what you miss out on."

02:15.001 --> 02:16.593
This must be what he meant.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.034
They didn't look like that
in my high school yearbook,

02:18.071 --> 02:19.698
that's for sure.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.237
They didn't sell
your high school yearbook

02:22.308 --> 02:23.434
in Times Square.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.047
What've we got,
a rare scissors collector?

02:28.114 --> 02:29.172
Photographic supplies.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.046
They're just like the ones
in the body.

02:31.117 --> 02:34.280
Listen, when you're done
with this, I want it, okay?

02:34.754 --> 02:36.119
Nice work.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.815
Think she needed any help
getting dressed?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.792
I think you don't
make a detective's salary

02:40.860 --> 02:42.452
for being
a photographer's assistant.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.326
When you're through
looking at that body,

02:44.397 --> 02:46.228
would you mind
taking a look at this one?

02:46.299 --> 02:47.459
The girl who found him

02:47.534 --> 02:49.365
was on her way
to have her picture taken.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.595
This guy told her

02:50.670 --> 02:52.535
that she was gonna be
on a magazine cover.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.834
He was supposed
to work tonight, huh?

02:55.909 --> 02:57.399
In his pajamas?

02:58.111 --> 02:59.510
Call it in.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.288
He made all the girls
bring him coffee.

04:26.866 --> 04:28.060
"Very light."

04:28.134 --> 04:30.261
Could've saved bucks,
he bought his own pot.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.236
Wasrt his money, was it?

04:32.305 --> 04:34.865
I was working
at Bloomingdale's,

04:34.941 --> 04:36.602
you know, spraying
cologne at people

04:36.676 --> 04:38.200
coming off the escalator?

04:38.778 --> 04:41.178
Mr. Decker
gave me his card

04:41.414 --> 04:43.109
before I could spray him.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.317
He said I had good cheekbones.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.512
Makes you Number 467, honey.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.582
He had girls in and out
all hours, all lookers,

04:50.657 --> 04:52.557
some of them two,
three times a day.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.518
The man had
very clean fingernails.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.620
Of course developing fluid,
do it every time.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.096
Or a good manicurist.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.292
No one gets manicures any more.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.959
You catch hepatitis.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.067
Isn't here.
Plenty of prints in the loft.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.664
Twelve usable sets
other than the victim's.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.834
I sent 'em all out. None
of them turned up a record.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.935
Maybe you noticed
we found a pair of scissors.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.708
Good thumb and index finger
at the top of the blade.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.114
Great. Now all we need
is a suspect.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.175
Look for a Black Widow Spider.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.945
Don't they kill their mates
after sex?

05:23.022 --> 05:24.956
Your victim had semen
and vaginal secretions

05:25.024 --> 05:26.389
in his Doctor Dentors.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.189
Okay. We find a woman,
can you make a match?

05:29.262 --> 05:30.923
The DNA in vaginal secretions?

05:30.997 --> 05:33.659
When there's
exfoliated epithelial cells,

05:33.733 --> 05:35.428
which there happen to be.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.696
Figure the guy pulls
his pj's on right after

05:37.770 --> 05:39.567
and just before he was killed.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.539
The samples werert even dry.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.438
You got a very
well-mannered killer here.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.033
Waited till he got dressed.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.976
I'm sure he was grateful.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.945
So where does that get us?
A lovers' quarrel?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.176
After sex?

05:51.250 --> 05:53.548
Most people, you fight
and then have sex.

05:53.619 --> 05:54.813
He's not married.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.616
So what is this?
The girlfriend leaves,

05:56.689 --> 05:58.782
he falls asleep,
a burglar wakes him?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.292
And stabs him
in the middle of the loft,

06:01.361 --> 06:03.386
in the back.
No struggle.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.023
I suppose that means
you have a better idea?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.728
He had four appointments
on his calendar.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.364
Julian Decker, huh!
What a loss.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.443
Then you werert
involved with him?

06:17.510 --> 06:19.637
However you mean that,
the answer is no.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.771
I had as little to do
with Julian as possible.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.339
And believe me,
I'd have preferred less.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.476
Do you know who was
involved with him?

06:26.552 --> 06:29.146
This city is full of women
with dreadful taste.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.985
But you're not one of them.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.922
He could smile
the chrome off a fender.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.721
I just didn't want him
around my girls.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.762
All right. So, you werert
working with him.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.093
But why were you his last
appointment yesterday?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.826
In his book, not mine.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.026
He barged in around 5:00.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.693
Wanted me to recommend him
for work.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.169
I asked him to leave.
He did.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.502
Hey, some girls
must've found him attractive.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.134
You'll find my girls

06:50.209 --> 06:52.234
<i>on the covers of Vogue,
Detective.</i>

06:52.311 --> 06:55.280
You'll find Juliars
in catalogue lingerie ads.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.009
Some girls
were interested in him.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.641
But not mine.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.985
Miss Norman?

07:02.054 --> 07:04.386
Gone for three weeks, Barbados.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.391
Saturday morning, first class.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.188
She took six suitcases.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.793
I got her sunscreen
before she left.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.559
Number 15, unscented.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.032
You fold her underwear, too?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.966
I like to be close
to my tenants.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.298
I wonder why.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.170
Didrt that calendar
have a red line

07:23.242 --> 07:24.834
through Clarissa Normars name?

07:24.911 --> 07:26.538
It was won'th checking.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.943
The other two are downtown.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.642
The 11:00 is East 16th,
off Park Avenue South.

07:30.716 --> 07:31.774
Angela Brant.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.513
I was making the rounds,
looking for work.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.782
Julian didn't have any.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.825
Which he told me
after I bought him breakfast.

07:39.892 --> 07:40.916
It seems Mr. Decker

07:40.993 --> 07:42.756
liked to take advantage
of people, huh?

07:43.429 --> 07:44.987
Doesrt everybody?

07:45.998 --> 07:49.229
Look, I'll never
have to buy him coffee again,

07:49.635 --> 07:51.500
but I will miss the work.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.005
How old would you say she is?

07:56.509 --> 07:57.806
Maybe 30.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.877
Try 16.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.607
They do her hair and make-up,
she looks 30.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.119
I'm 38, I haven't looked 30
since I was 20.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.213
It's easy to take
advantage of me.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.349
I wouldn't peg you as
that vulnerable, Miss Brant.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.022
I was a model when I was a kid.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.596
In my senior year
in high school,

08:18.664 --> 08:20.461
I made five times
what my father did

08:20.533 --> 08:21.966
in his hardware store.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.093
All the big agencies wanted me.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.763
Celeste Foxx herself
came around.

08:27.707 --> 08:30.175
Problem is, it doesn't last.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.244
You're still working.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.438
I have a daughter
in private school.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.948
I'll be doing catalogues
from the grave.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.644
Sounds like
you needed Mr. Decker a lot.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.581
Not enough to sleep with him.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.087
You know who did?

08:44.123 --> 08:46.990
I told you, I didn't work
for him that much.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.223
Now, if that's all,
I'm late for aerobics.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.025
Uh, just one more thing,
Miss Brant.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.297
Can you tell us
where you were from, uh,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.461
let's say, 6:00 to
about 8:00 last night?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.629
What?

09:00.339 --> 09:01.465
Hi, kids.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.565
Hi.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.573
What's going on?

09:04.644 --> 09:06.612
I have to go out.
We can discuss it later.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.271
Why don't you go
hang out in your room

09:08.347 --> 09:09.439
for a while, okay?

09:09.515 --> 09:11.073
Okay.
Okay.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.186
I admitted I didn't like him.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.452
Can we finish
this some other time?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.390
Could you just tell us
where you were last night?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.751
I had dinner
with my ex-husband.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.797
Got home around 9:00.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.356
Jeffrey Brant. He's a banker.

09:30.036 --> 09:33.528
Until when? Okay.
Well, thank you, Mr. Brant.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.975
The ex-husband says
that he was with her

09:37.043 --> 09:39.307
from 6:00 until
some time past 8:00.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.436
It's an alibi,

09:40.513 --> 09:42.947
unless she got to
the phone before we did.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.507
Next up, Betty Ann Can'ter,
West 24th.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.050
Want to bet she didn't
like him either?

09:49.121 --> 09:50.679
Look on the bright side.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.087
If we do this all week,

09:52.158 --> 09:54.058
<i>you'll never have
to buy Playboy again.</i>

09:54.126 --> 09:55.252
What are you saying?

09:55.328 --> 09:56.795
I treat all women like objects?

09:56.862 --> 09:58.796
More specific.
Like furniture.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.724
This one, I promise,
I won't even look at her.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.030
What do you want me
to do? Cry?

10:06.105 --> 10:09.302
I'll send a check to
the Dead Photographers' fund.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.070
You did work for him,
Miss Can'ter.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.840
You don't have a bed,
you sleep in the gutter.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.575
I get into shape,
I'm out of catalogues

10:16.649 --> 10:18.207
and back in magazines.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.844
You don't look like
you're falling apart.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.218
You should've seen me
at 19, sugar.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.086
Miss Southern Alabama
Cotton Queen.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.852
Without liftir a finger.

10:26.926 --> 10:30.327
<i>Cover of Mademoiselle.
Studio 54 till dawn.</i>

10:30.730 --> 10:32.960
Julian said
that I was finished.

10:33.599 --> 10:37.057
Well, Lauren Huttors past 40.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.366
She works.
I'm still a Size 6.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.470
You'll pardon me,

10:41.540 --> 10:44.008
but if this is what you get
when you're out of work...

10:44.276 --> 10:45.607
Oh, yeah.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.336
Well, used to be owned
by me and Citibank.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.678
Now, just the bank,
and they're sellir it.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.112
Poor Julian,
may he rest in hell.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.114
Who do you think killed him?

10:56.188 --> 10:58.247
We think he had a girlfriend.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.588
Oh. I see.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.525
Last night?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.826
I was on a revolving pedestal

11:04.897 --> 11:07.024
pointir at the kind of yacht
I used to cruise on.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.589
Boat show, the Meadowlands.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.795
Better than what
a lot of girls end up doir.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.929
You mean to supplement
their income.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.905
What do you think you do
when this goes,

11:14.974 --> 11:16.965
and these are
all you have left?

11:18.277 --> 11:19.608
Thank you.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.705
She was on a yacht display
from 3:00 till 10:00.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.045
She didn't get dizzy?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.744
No, she got a break
from 5:00 to 7:00.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.309
The guy doesn't know
where she was.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.548
All right. Well, that's a
half-hour through the tunnel,

11:30.623 --> 11:32.250
and a half-hour back.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.417
That gives her
just enough time.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.085
Not unless she can fly.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.288
I went to see the in-laws,

11:37.363 --> 11:39.331
one of the tubes
was closed in the Lincoln.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.558
Two hours just to get there.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.498
Round-trip in two hours?
No way.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.401
We got no girlfriend. We don't
even know who could've been there.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.803
All we got is a sleazeball
who was begging for work.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.273
Who says the one he had sex
with is the one who killed him?

11:50.342 --> 11:52.242
Wait a minute.
Am I missing something here?

11:52.311 --> 11:54.006
This guy was begging for work?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.514
He even made the girls
buy him coffee.

11:56.582 --> 11:59.847
Expensive camera equipment,
3,000 square feet in Tribeca.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.853
This guy must've been
one heck of a beggar.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.445
Find out how he paid
for his life,

12:03.522 --> 12:05.752
maybe we find out
the reason it's over.

12:05.825 --> 12:06.883
Not much in the loft.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.756
What, there were boxes
of receipts.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.796
And four-year-old tax returns.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.421
Signed by a CPA?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.794
Mr. Decker.

12:17.069 --> 12:21.768
He reported $68,000
gross income last year.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.108
According to
his travel records,

12:24.176 --> 12:26.701
his trips to the islands
cost at least half that.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.406
Those were photo shoots.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.346
That's a legitimate
business deduction.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.044
And his food, and his mortgage,

12:33.119 --> 12:35.781
and his clothes, and
his equipment, and Uncle Sam,

12:35.855 --> 12:37.823
all came out of the rest of it?

12:37.890 --> 12:40.154
Well, I only know
what he reported.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.717
I don't know a thing
about his other income.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.430
If there was any other income.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.135
You like to go to the islands,
too, Mr. O'Hara?

12:51.203 --> 12:52.670
Me? No,

12:52.972 --> 12:54.940
my skin can't take the sun.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.465
That's good,

12:56.542 --> 12:58.203
'cause if you signed
those tax returns

12:58.277 --> 12:59.574
knowing he had other income,

12:59.645 --> 13:01.806
you're gonna be
out of the sun a long time.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.883
Okay, look.
Models have a short life span.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.479
Julian found them other work.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.649
Remember the guy in the diner?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.455
Said girls were going
in and out of there

13:15.528 --> 13:16.927
two, three times a day.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.463
What were they doing,
Mr. O'Hara?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.260
Getting their
graduation photos taken?

13:20.332 --> 13:22.562
Okay. A lot of guys
who'll pay big bucks

13:22.635 --> 13:25.433
to see a girl from the swimsuit
issue without her swimsuit.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.493
So that the guy could

13:26.572 --> 13:28.403
slip into something
more comfortable.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.139
Everybody's a consenting adult.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.679
No harm, no foul, right?

13:40.119 --> 13:43.111
This guy was not only
a photographer, he was a pimp.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.054
Yeah, and where does
that get you?

13:45.124 --> 13:46.887
A john did it?
One of his girls?

13:46.959 --> 13:49.018
We don't know any of
his johns. Or his girls.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.562
Well, you'd better start with
all the models he photographed.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.257
Check their bank accounts.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.890
The cotton queen.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.130
She talked about
what the other girls did

13:57.203 --> 13:58.465
when their faces went.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.334
She didn't mean
they got rich boyfriends.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.930
Rich boyfriends by the hour.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.237
But she didn't know
Decker was a pimp.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.244
Or she didn't want to tell us.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.280
Sure he asked me to do it.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.579
$2,500 a week on my back
instead of $500 on my feet.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.781
Well, it must've been tempting.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.116
Maybe to you.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.985
But, honey,
I don't think you'd survive.

14:18.057 --> 14:21.117
In my experience, cops just
can't perform that often.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.024
So, you never
turned a trick, huh?

14:24.396 --> 14:25.795
Those beauty contests,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.163
some cracker judge
would put his hands on my ass

14:28.234 --> 14:30.065
and offer me more money
than I'd ever seen

14:30.135 --> 14:31.295
to be his date.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.930
I didn't do it then,
I don't do it now.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.035
That doesn't mean
I have any cause

14:36.108 --> 14:37.439
to look down on those who do.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.340
That's real democratic of you.

14:39.411 --> 14:40.935
Well, it's a free country.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.140
At least I don't drink
from the taxpayer's trough,

14:43.215 --> 14:44.512
like some people.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.845
Did Mr. Decker try
to put pressure on you?

14:48.921 --> 14:50.320
Oh, every time I was there.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.754
He'd be at his little computer,

14:51.824 --> 14:53.689
addir up the money
the girls would bring.

14:53.759 --> 14:54.726
But I told him,

14:54.793 --> 14:57.023
"Honey, you can type
till your fingers fall off.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.155
I work vertical
or not at all."

15:03.736 --> 15:05.829
We found files
on Decker's hard drive,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.304
one for each month.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.965
They go back two years.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.531
Trouble is,
they have passwords.

15:10.609 --> 15:11.940
Well, can't you break the code?

15:12.011 --> 15:13.979
Randomly I wouldn't
find the right algorithm

15:14.046 --> 15:15.274
till next summer.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.338
FBI computers could do it.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.214
Six weeks.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.351
Six weeks. Oh, no problem.
Right, Phil?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.785
Our case won't go cold.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.015
What's on the files?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.681
We were hoping hookers.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.389
What would he call them?

15:29.461 --> 15:30.689
Hookers.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.965
Wiseass.
You know the guy's birthday?

15:41.273 --> 15:43.366
November 15, 1959.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.643
Okay, the initials
must be hookers

15:51.717 --> 15:53.708
with dates and dollar amounts.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.948
The names and addresses
must be the johns.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.722
H.D. Gets anywhere
from $750 to $1,000.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.691
She presses your pants
when she's done.

16:03.762 --> 16:06.526
I have a feeling it's more
specialized than that.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.624
R.L. Mostly $200 a shot,

16:09.702 --> 16:11.567
but she doesn't
work Wednesdays.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.070
Choir practice.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.135
A.B. $150 to $300.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.872
J.S., about the same.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.671
A.B.? His second appointment
of the day.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.944
What, Angela what's her name?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.488
Brant. East 16th.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.654
A.B. Could there be
more than one?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.963
She said she was
with her husband, right?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.520
He confirmed it.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.633
Still, it's won'th a shot.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.028
Allan Rohmer. 874,
Third Avenue.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.628
Every Monday at 6:00.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.137
Late Monday afternoon?

16:50.209 --> 16:52.370
I was probably
casting a commercial.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.570
You use the couch?

16:56.181 --> 16:58.615
Only in movies
from the '50s, Detective.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.208
In advertising
we barely have time

17:00.285 --> 17:01.445
to sharpen the pencils.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.249
What did you have time
for Monday night,

17:03.322 --> 17:04.721
let's say around 6:00?

17:05.391 --> 17:06.653
Is this a hobby with you

17:06.724 --> 17:08.954
or are you looking
to change professions?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.757
I was casting
an airline commercial.

17:10.829 --> 17:11.887
I needed stewardesses.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.525
Oh, yeah? Well, fly me.
My initials are A.B.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.000
Do you look for stewardesses
every Monday, Mr. Rohmer?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.900
<i>Look, I, I saw all that
in the Post about Decker,</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:27.678
but what has this
got to do with Angela?

17:30.849 --> 17:32.407
Was Miss Brant here?

17:32.518 --> 17:33.883
Yes. She was very nervous.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.045
She was all worked up.
But you don't think Angela...

17:36.121 --> 17:38.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was she nervous about?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.785
Look, she's a lovely lady.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.450
I like her a lot.
I didn't ask.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.461
She sharpen your pencil?

17:43.695 --> 17:45.492
She asked if we could skip it,

17:45.564 --> 17:47.088
she wasrt in the mood.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.532
She was only here
maybe 20 minutes.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.202
So, you're tellir me

17:51.270 --> 17:53.329
she makes a stop
on Third Avenue,

17:53.405 --> 17:56.533
cries on his shoulder,
races downtown,

17:56.608 --> 17:58.576
has sex with Decker
and then kills him?

17:58.644 --> 18:00.236
Well, this was a hooker
and her pimp.

18:00.312 --> 18:03.008
Maybe she wanted to change the
deal. Maybe he wanted to change it.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.812
Maybe she couldn't get over
the slaughter in Yugoslavia.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.182
Well, first she said
she was with her ex-husband.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.153
Then it turns out
she's at the ad agency.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.055
She's breaking the law, Mike.
What do you want her to say?

18:13.125 --> 18:15.593
"Oh, that's right, Officer,
I was out turning tricks."

18:15.661 --> 18:17.686
Now, when did the husband
say he was with her?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.458
He said 6:00 to 8:00.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.193
"Hello, dear. If you don't
want your name in the papers

18:22.267 --> 18:24.531
"when the cops get there,
tell them we had dinner

18:24.603 --> 18:25.900
at 6:00, not 7:00."

18:25.971 --> 18:28.269
So she's a liar. It doesn't
mean she's a killer.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.399
I'd like
to toss her apartment anyway.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.410
Just to see if Decker's blood
shows up.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.002
What are you gonna do
for a warrant?

18:34.079 --> 18:35.546
She has an alibi.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.212
Get a print on her. You may
get a match on the scissors.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.750
We already ran her.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.979
No priors, no civil service.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.021
Well,
wait a minute. Phil,

18:44.089 --> 18:45.750
you remember we were leavir,

18:45.824 --> 18:47.052
she was in a big rush

18:47.126 --> 18:48.593
to go to what,
an aerobics class?

18:48.660 --> 18:49.592
So?

18:49.661 --> 18:51.128
So, she didn't leave
with a bag.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.164
Maybe she's got a locker
at the health club.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.860
Excuse me. You don't have
probable cause for an apartment,

18:55.934 --> 18:57.492
you don't have it
for a gym locker.

18:57.569 --> 18:58.831
What?
The outside of a locker?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.428
There's no expectation
of privacy.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.373
How much privacy can you
expect in a locker room?

19:07.312 --> 19:08.904
Are you sure this is legal?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.006
We have your permission.
That makes it legal.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.710
What if I didn't
give permission?

19:12.784 --> 19:14.911
Then we've to go and get a
warrant, come back tomorrow

19:14.987 --> 19:16.477
and close you down
for a whole day,

19:16.555 --> 19:18.523
instead of just
your locker room for an hour.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.088
Got a pretty good thumb
and index finger.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.596
Let's hope they're a match.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.256
Let's hope they're hers.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.093
Hey, Phil.
You know the warrant

19:30.169 --> 19:32.637
you told that healthclub guy
you'd get?

19:32.704 --> 19:35.366
Exactly what probable cause
did you have in mind?

19:35.440 --> 19:36.429
A senile judge.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.839
First prize, gentlemen.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.105
Which of you gets the Styrofoam
dice for the windshield?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.203
What do you got?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.975
Latent said the prints
from the locker

19:43.048 --> 19:45.175
match the prints on the
scissors from Decker's back.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.150
How about that
for probable cause?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.219
I told you I saw
Julian that morning.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.381
You didn't go back later?

19:51.456 --> 19:54.118
I was with my ex-husband. For
dinner. I told you that, too.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.423
Yeah, you told me your ex
was a banker. That's right.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.190
Not an ad exec on Third Avenue.

19:58.263 --> 20:01.061
I didn't want you to know about
that. My daughter was there.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.498
It's not something
I'm proud of.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.559
And I did see
my husband for dinner.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.035
Phil!

20:15.013 --> 20:17.208
Well, if there's blood
on anything, I don't see it.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.250
Decker had sex with somebody.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.676
You think she got up
and went home

20:21.753 --> 20:23.243
without getting dressed?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.583
What can I tell you?

20:26.658 --> 20:28.489
Her prints are
on the murder weapon.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.528
She admits she was
in the loft that morning.

20:30.596 --> 20:31.927
The underwear, Paul.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.897
The vaginal secretions
match what they found

20:33.966 --> 20:35.194
in Decker's pajamas.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.292
She could've had sex
with him in the morning, too.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.597
No, she couldn't.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.695
The sample
from the pajamas was fresh.

20:40.772 --> 20:41.796
How fresh?

20:41.873 --> 20:43.932
What do you want, a videotape
of her boffir the guy

20:44.009 --> 20:45.977
and then stickir
the scissors in his back?

20:46.478 --> 20:47.502
How fresh?

20:47.579 --> 20:50.173
No more than two hours. It puts
her there when he was killed.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.546
She's a hooker, Paul.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.551
She slept with her pimp,
she got very angry,

20:53.619 --> 20:55.211
and she stabbed him.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.948
<i>Call Eyewitness News.
We've never seen</i>

20:57.022 --> 20:59.650
anything like this
in New York City before.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.724
Okay. Pick her up.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.261
Next case,
"docket number 64931.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.804
<i>"People v. Angela Brant.</i>

21:13.872 --> 21:16.067
The charge is murder
in the second degree."

21:16.141 --> 21:18.109
Miss Green.
Delightful to see you.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.201
You grace my courtroom
so rarely.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.338
Certainly not by choice,
Your Honor.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.276
Tell your client it's time
to say the magic words.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.710
Not guilty.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.583
Your Honor,
with a case this strong,

21:29.655 --> 21:31.486
the People see
a substantial flight risk.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.148
We request $250,000.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.420
The defendant has custody
of her daughter, Your Honor.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.758
High bail would be
a serious hardship.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.262
She should've thought
of her child

21:39.331 --> 21:41.231
before she became a prostitute.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.892
Did it ever occur to Your Honor

21:42.968 --> 21:44.560
that some women
become prostitutes

21:44.636 --> 21:46.729
in order
to support their children?

21:47.773 --> 21:48.933
How stupid of me.

21:49.007 --> 21:51.635
God forbid you should
get a regular job.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.302
And let me point out,
Miss Green,

21:53.378 --> 21:56.745
for your next visit,
that's a table, not a soapbox.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.813
Bail is $150,000.
Short date.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.353
In honor of motherhood.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.054
Murder two?

22:05.123 --> 22:07.091
You couldn't convict her
of bad manners.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.059
Depraved indifference
to human life.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.595
A scissors in the back,
I think that qualifies.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.291
I had sex with him.
It doesn't prove I killed him.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.664
Miss Brant,
you lied about being there,

22:16.735 --> 22:18.430
you lied about your alibi,

22:18.503 --> 22:20.061
and even your lawyer
will tell you

22:20.138 --> 22:22.698
that if you lie enough,
juries tend to be suspicious.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.308
Oh, I forgot that section
of the penal law.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.345
Twenty-five years for lying.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.641
Did she lie
about her income, too?

22:31.717 --> 22:34.413
Or are you changing
your standards at legal aid?

22:34.486 --> 22:36.750
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She's just flatbacking

22:36.822 --> 22:39.290
until she can liquidate
a major position at IBM.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.655
She's going to pay us back.

22:40.726 --> 22:44.127
Meanwhile. The fingerprints?
Meaningless.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.263
And there's
a little rumor going around

22:46.331 --> 22:48.492
that your DNA match
to my client

22:48.567 --> 22:49.864
is less than perfect.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.869
You shouldn't even
be going to trial.

22:51.937 --> 22:54.303
If we had perfect cases,
we wouldn't need juries.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.465
And less than perfect

22:55.540 --> 22:57.701
certainly doesn't change
my job description.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.767
I'll tell the jury
she's on trial

22:59.845 --> 23:01.745
because prostitutes
are easy targets.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.680
She was used by her johns,
abused by her pimp,

23:04.750 --> 23:06.684
and desperate to
support her daughter.

23:06.752 --> 23:09.186
What am I hearing?
A prostitute's manifesto?

23:09.254 --> 23:11.518
Hookers of the world unite,
kill your oppressors?

23:11.590 --> 23:14.024
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
I don't need his contempt.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.184
Angela, wait.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.352
Look-it.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.986
Julian Decker
was primeval slime

23:18.063 --> 23:19.189
and killing him

23:19.264 --> 23:21.391
was like using penicillin
to kill the clap.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.627
Miss Brant,
I'm not sure your resume

23:23.702 --> 23:25.226
entitles you to that judgment.

23:25.303 --> 23:26.463
Right.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.332
You want to do this, Stone?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.899
I'll clean your clock.

23:31.977 --> 23:35.504
When I'm through, you won't
even care what time it is.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.982
She practically
admitted killing him

23:43.054 --> 23:44.316
and dared us to convict.

23:44.389 --> 23:45.822
And maybe you'll lose.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.415
Who said hookers were dumb?

23:47.492 --> 23:49.153
Dumb enough
not to wash her underwear.

23:49.227 --> 23:50.888
And dumb enough
to leave prints.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.362
You have no motive.
She has an alibi.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.798
Shambala Green says
pity the poor prostitute,

23:55.867 --> 23:57.732
she's supporting her child,

23:57.803 --> 23:59.862
and by the way,
everybody hated him,

23:59.938 --> 24:01.371
my client didn't do it.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.600
You get no conviction.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.767
We can put her there
at the time of the murder.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.834
With our excellent lab results.

24:06.912 --> 24:08.903
What, you think Green
can get this suppressed?

24:08.980 --> 24:11.414
Brant's DNA
is an 80 percent match

24:11.483 --> 24:13.508
to the vaginal secretions
in the pajamas.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.849
Her ex-husband says
he was with her.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.548
Okay, it's not a walk
in the park.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.113
Yes, it is.
You're gonna get mugged.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.451
Break the womars alibi.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.085
Well, what did the husband say?

24:24.162 --> 24:26.926
Delia's restaurant,
in the Village, having dinner.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.899
Let's see if somebody
remembers if they were there.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.465
The cashier remembered Angela.

24:34.539 --> 24:36.097
He saw her picture
in the papers.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.903
God bless the fourth estate.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.307
Does he remember
when they left?

24:39.377 --> 24:41.402
Well, she and her
ex-husband had an argument.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.004
Stalked out
just after they ordered.

24:43.081 --> 24:44.548
Long before 8:00.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.111
He could've been with her
the rest of the night.

24:47.185 --> 24:48.743
Yeah, if they
patched it up quick.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.082
The cashier was at the window.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.123
Says they walked off
in opposite directions.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.556
Let's go find out
what the husband remembers.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.320
Angela always says that.
Like I work on Wall Street.

25:00.232 --> 25:03.224
I'm a loan officer. She likes
the sound of "banker."

25:04.336 --> 25:05.860
Look, uh,

25:06.071 --> 25:09.199
I don't really remember
when we finished dinner.

25:10.408 --> 25:11.898
You don't remember.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.175
The cashier remembers
the shouting started

25:14.246 --> 25:15.372
before the entrée.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.346
We had a disagreement, okay?

25:25.924 --> 25:28.222
Angela wanted
more child support.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.284
When you argue
about child support,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.956
do you usually
stalk out of the restaurant?

25:33.798 --> 25:38.258
She said Decker
was gouging her on her fees.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.404
You knew she was a prostitute?

25:41.940 --> 25:44.170
Yeah, I knew about Angela.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.833
But my daughter didn't,
and I didn't want her to.

25:46.912 --> 25:47.936
You also told the police

25:48.013 --> 25:49.674
you were with her
from 6:00 to 8:00.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.877
In court,
that's called perjury.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.380
I got a wife,
two kids besides Tracy.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.185
Does everybody have to be
dragged into this?

26:03.261 --> 26:06.025
Then, let's say,
let's say I wasrt with her.

26:06.932 --> 26:08.797
Can we just leave it at that?

26:09.668 --> 26:12.000
Let's say you'll testify,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.929
or you'll be reading
a contempt citation.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.514
She called.

26:26.952 --> 26:29.443
She was in a panic. She said
the cops had just been there.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.615
She asked me to say
I was with her.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.554
She got into a cab.

26:37.662 --> 26:39.892
Around 7:00 at the latest.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.667
I knew Angela to say hello.

26:48.740 --> 26:51.573
I used to see her
at Juliars. Mr. Decker's.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.604
Did she ever share her feelings

26:53.678 --> 26:54.872
about Mr. Decker with you?

26:54.946 --> 26:57.107
Objection. Calls for hearsay.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.878
Offered for the defendant's
state of mind, Your Honor.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.942
Overruled.
Go on, Miss Can'ter.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.948
Angela said she wanted
to warn me about him.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.923
She was having
some trouble with her bills,

27:06.992 --> 27:08.755
her daughter
is in private school.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.658
Mr. Decker loaned her
some money

27:10.729 --> 27:13.061
and told her that she could
make it up on a shoot.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.359
When she didn't get any work,

27:14.432 --> 27:16.024
he told her
that she could make it up

27:16.101 --> 27:17.227
on her back.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.400
And what was the defendant's
reaction to that?

27:21.006 --> 27:23.600
Well, she was angry.
She told me she felt trapped.

27:23.675 --> 27:26.235
She had to pay him
and she needed more money.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.643
Thank you. Your witness.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.349
When did this happen?

27:36.421 --> 27:39.720
Miss Brant feeling that she'd
been trapped by Mr. Decker?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.758
Uh, six, seven months ago.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.521
So she was angry
seven months ago.

27:46.064 --> 27:49.363
Did you ever hear Miss Brant
threaten to kill Mr. Decker?

27:49.434 --> 27:51.868
No. She never said
a thing like that.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.000
What were your feelings
toward Mr. Decker?

27:55.907 --> 27:58.899
Well,
like a lot of people, I...

28:02.881 --> 28:04.940
Actually I'd say
I hated Julian Decker

28:05.016 --> 28:06.677
and I hope he rots in hell.

28:08.653 --> 28:09.813
Thank you.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.355
No further questions.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.719
I didn't ask Angela
if she'd killed him.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.820
I mean, it was on the phone,

28:19.431 --> 28:21.558
and I really
didn't want to know.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.658
Did Miss Brant tell you
about her conversation

28:23.735 --> 28:25.032
with the police?

28:26.071 --> 28:27.868
She thought they'd call me.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.806
She wanted me to say that
I was with her until 8:00.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.070
She said that
if I told the truth,

28:33.645 --> 28:35.738
we'd all get our names
in the papers.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.009
It'd be bad for me,
my wife, my kids,

28:38.083 --> 28:40.210
our daughter Tracy.
All of us.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.915
Thank you.
No further questions.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.122
You and your ex-wife
hardly spoke, Mr. Brant.

28:53.198 --> 28:54.597
Why was that?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.635
The way Angela lives.

28:59.804 --> 29:02.602
It doesn't fit
the life I have now.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.404
What about your life
six years ago?

29:06.778 --> 29:08.746
We didn't have one.
We were divorced.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.748
I meant the custody suit
over your daughter Tracy.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.440
The suit you lost.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.042
I didn't lose. I withdrew.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.953
You told the police you were
with your ex-wife that night.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.319
Now you say you werert.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.450
Now, in fact, isn't your
entire testimony today a lie?

29:22.527 --> 29:24.427
Werert you with Angela Brant

29:24.496 --> 29:26.088
the night
Julian Decker was killed?

29:26.164 --> 29:27.961
Objection.
Asked and answered.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.431
Sustained.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.800
Would you prefer
to see your ex-wife convicted

29:39.878 --> 29:41.846
if it meant getting custody
of your daughter?

29:41.913 --> 29:42.902
Objection.

29:42.981 --> 29:44.744
In fact, won't you do
just about anything

29:44.816 --> 29:46.147
to get custody
of your daughter?

29:46.217 --> 29:47.582
She's badgering the witness.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.620
Miss Green, that's enough.

29:51.422 --> 29:52.787
Withdrawn.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.650
No further questions.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.657
A custody case? I can't even
think of a better reason to lie.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.324
That was six years ago, Adam.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.799
He has a new wife, new kids.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.062
He wouldn't want custody.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.127
Is that what a jury thinks?

30:07.572 --> 30:09.164
As a reason
to put your wife in jail,

30:09.240 --> 30:11.970
custody of a child
is the ultimate motive.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.703
Who prepped the husband?

30:13.778 --> 30:15.268
I did.
He never mentioned it.

30:15.346 --> 30:16.904
Bring in the rest
of your witnesses.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.541
Go over their testimony.
No more surprises.

30:20.451 --> 30:21.782
Thank you.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.419
Miss Green has
just filed a motion

30:28.493 --> 30:30.427
to suppress your DNA evidence.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.696
Should've been pre-trial.
Judge Baum will ignore it.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.756
No court in the country
rejects DNA.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.597
Until this afternoon.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.996
Judge Lucas, down the hall
from Judge Baum.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.905
Rejected our DNA tests
in the Gelman murder.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.240
You better hope that Judge Baum

30:46.311 --> 30:48.677
doesn't play bridge
with Judge Lucas.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.711
This is absurd. She should've
made this motion weeks ago.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.115
Judge Lucas just
changed the picture.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.449
The DNA sample in the Gelman
case was contaminated.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.579
Ours isn't.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.816
Could we look
at the law, please?

30:59.891 --> 31:02.382
<i>The standard
is Frye v. United States.</i>

31:02.727 --> 31:05.025
"The evidence must
have gained general acceptance

31:05.096 --> 31:06.893
in the field in which
it belongs."

31:06.965 --> 31:08.990
We don't have
general acceptance.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.194
Six months ago the National
Academy of Sciences

31:11.269 --> 31:13.897
said DNA tests
are questionable.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.440
They said the labs were
questionable, not the tests.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.169
Juries treat science like God.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.144
Especially from police experts.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.544
Pardon me,
I do the lecturing here.

31:24.148 --> 31:26.275
You tested
the vaginal secretions

31:26.351 --> 31:27.909
against the defendant's DNA.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.920
You got an 80 percent match.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.284
The sample was fresh,
why isn't the match perfect?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.317
Nothing's perfect.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.721
What is that,
philosophy or law?

31:38.930 --> 31:41.296
This evidence
should be admissible.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.700
But I'm no expert.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.463
The scientists can't agree.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.003
Your Honor,
with all due respect...

31:47.071 --> 31:49.096
I hope you'll respect me
in the morning.

31:49.173 --> 31:52.665
But I'm going to have to rule
the DNA is not admissible.

31:53.144 --> 31:56.079
You want to put the defendant
at the murder scene, Ben,

31:56.147 --> 31:57.910
find another way to do it.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.682
Judge Baum is an idiot.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.724
Stuff envelopes
for the county leader,

32:06.791 --> 32:08.349
you, too, can ascend
to the bench.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.358
No DNA.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.418
If we don't put her there
at the time of the murder,

32:11.496 --> 32:12.963
the jury'll be out
in five minutes.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.225
You'll never get to the jury.

32:14.299 --> 32:15.766
We're looking at a dismissal.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.630
Who saw your victim last?

32:17.702 --> 32:19.260
The modeling agency, Foxx.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.430
Did Decker say anything
to put Angela with him

32:21.506 --> 32:23.235
later that day?
Did we ask?

32:23.308 --> 32:25.503
We werert planning
on calling her as a witness.

32:25.576 --> 32:27.373
Let's ask her. Personally.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.973
If he was seeing Angela,
he wouldn't have told me.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.650
Frankly, I'm surprised.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.179
She's a little old for Julian.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.354
Sounds like you almost
feel sorry for her.

32:40.425 --> 32:41.858
I almost do.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.553
I'm sorrier for her daughter.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.858
She wants to be
just like Angela.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.194
Brought in her own portfolio,
taken by Decker.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.733
She doesn't have
her mother's legs.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.359
Podgy. Bad legs.

32:51.436 --> 32:52.733
The daughter?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.533
She had her pictures
taken by Decker?

32:54.605 --> 32:57.130
Tracy said her mother
encouraged her.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.740
A little hard to believe.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.211
Who would know?

33:03.047 --> 33:05.572
Tracy's friends, maybe.
Her school, Miss Harker's.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.947
I went there myself.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.112
On career day, six girls
handed me their portfolios.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.123
How much does
something like that cost?

33:13.191 --> 33:16.126
$1,500 minimum.
Even from Decker.

33:17.462 --> 33:19.987
It makes one wonder
why he did Tracy's.

33:20.264 --> 33:23.062
Tracy always bragged
about her older boyfriend.

33:23.134 --> 33:26.797
The fashion photographer.
Tracy was gonna be a star.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.533
The next Cindy Crawford.
Just like her mother.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.507
Tracy's pretty,
she could be a model.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.203
If they shot her
from the waist up.

33:33.277 --> 33:34.744
Those legs!

33:34.812 --> 33:36.302
She could do fingernail ads.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.276
If a big fashion photographer
came on to me,

33:40.351 --> 33:41.943
I'd be interested.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.887
Did Tracy's mother know
about this boyfriend?

33:44.956 --> 33:47.550
They had a fight on
the sidewalk, right outside.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.752
Mrs. Brant
found her portfolio.

33:49.827 --> 33:52.557
Mrs. Brant thought
something else was going on.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.164
Do you know what she meant?

33:55.233 --> 33:56.723
They were in love.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.263
And we're 15, not 12.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.929
The mother knew about
Decker and her daughter?

34:03.007 --> 34:04.099
Yeah, it's motive.

34:04.175 --> 34:06.268
But it doesn't put Brant
in the loft that night.

34:06.344 --> 34:07.811
The kids never
heard Decker's name

34:07.879 --> 34:10.245
or saw the daughter with him.
It's all hearsay.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.339
What's the problem?
Put the daughter on the stand.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.815
Whatever she knows, she'll lie.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.217
It gives us leverage on Brant,
might get us a deal.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.585
So get a subpoena
for the daughter to testify.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.884
Her testimony isn't relevant.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.291
You'll never get it in.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.455
Last time I looked,
motive was relevant.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.623
This is a homicide,

34:27.697 --> 34:29.859
even Judge Baum
won't keep her off the stand.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.129
Do you know what this will do
to my daughter?

34:32.203 --> 34:34.262
I don't think it's a lot worse
than what you did.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.135
Man two, three to nine.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.435
What does that mean?

34:37.507 --> 34:39.135
It means they're desperate.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.077
Miss Green is wrong. It means
three to nine years in jail.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.340
We're not interested.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.402
Maybe I am.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.880
Come on, Angela, let's go.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.578
It's not won'th it.
I've ruined my life,

34:48.652 --> 34:50.813
I don't want
to ruin Tracy's, too.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.251
Angela, trust me,

34:54.324 --> 34:56.259
Tracy will never
take the stand.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.692
You're misleading your client.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.229
You're misleading yourself.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.231
I'll see you at the hearing.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.661
This meets no standard
of relevance.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.400
It's a fishing expedition.

35:10.475 --> 35:11.772
The defendant was angry

35:11.843 --> 35:14.004
about her daughter's
involvement with the victim.

35:14.078 --> 35:15.067
It goes to motive.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.545
Motive? It's a theory.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.707
Last week she killed him
over money.

35:18.783 --> 35:19.909
Now it's her daughter.

35:19.984 --> 35:22.145
Next week it'll be
whatever new motive

35:22.220 --> 35:24.780
you dream up over lunch
at the University Club.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.448
Ben, the standard

35:26.524 --> 35:29.254
is whether the testimony
is relevant or collateral.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.386
You don't know if it's
relevant and neither do I.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.486
Thank you.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.531
Don't buy me an apple yet,
Miss Green.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.396
I'll question the girl
in chambers

35:36.467 --> 35:38.332
and then make a decision.

35:38.402 --> 35:41.064
Relevance aside, Your Honor,
the girl's in trauma.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.970
She's seeing a psychiatrist.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.701
An interview
at this point is...

35:44.775 --> 35:47.335
Fine, I'll order
a psychiatric exam.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.106
By my psychiatrist.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.579
With me present.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.206
For you, Miss Green, anything.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.410
This court orders
a psychiatric exam

35:54.485 --> 35:58.012
of Tracy Brant
with defense counsel present.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.327
<i>I was with my mom.</i>

36:03.394 --> 36:05.362
<i>It... It was
a catalogue shoot.</i>

36:05.763 --> 36:07.560
<i>Julian saw me,
he liked me.</i>

36:07.632 --> 36:10.795
<i>He said I had great coloring,
better than Mom's.</i>

36:11.769 --> 36:14.067
<i>I had a chance
even if she didn't.</i>

36:14.739 --> 36:15.797
<i>Did your mom know</i>

36:15.873 --> 36:17.602
<i>that you were sleeping
with Julian?</i>

36:21.245 --> 36:23.406
She found
some pictures he took.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.983
I didn't have any clothes on.

36:27.985 --> 36:29.612
What did your mom do?

36:31.422 --> 36:33.856
She told me
not to see him again.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.025
She said I'd end up
as a prostitute.

36:37.428 --> 36:39.419
She had no right to say that.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.726
You continued to see Julian.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.433
I had to.

36:48.839 --> 36:50.272
I needed him.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.475
Was Julian the first man
you'd had sex with?

36:59.116 --> 37:00.947
He was experienced.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.481
He made me feel safe.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.957
Do you think your mom
killed him because of you?

37:10.027 --> 37:11.824
Out of bounds, Doc.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.025
Don't answer that, Tracy.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.199
Tracy, how did your mom
feel about you being a model?

37:22.573 --> 37:24.632
She said it was a bad life.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.104
But it was just
too hard for her.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.404
She didn't want it bad enough.
She wasrt dedicated.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.881
But I am.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.857
It's what everybody wants.

37:41.626 --> 37:42.991
My friends.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.020
To have everybody think
you're beautiful.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.296
Fifteen years old,

37:51.369 --> 37:53.200
she seemed fairly
self-possessed to me.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.171
Too self-possessed.
Did you hear her?

37:55.239 --> 37:56.604
A scared child

37:56.674 --> 37:58.005
afraid of her mother
one minute.

37:58.075 --> 38:00.407
A tough kid, contemptuous
of her mother the next.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.708
You saying
she shouldn't testify?

38:02.780 --> 38:05.305
There's something missing
with this girl.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.375
Tracy Brant's life
was bound up in this man.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.148
Everything she wanted, Julian
Decker would get it for her.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.588
If her mother killed him,
she should be enraged.

38:13.658 --> 38:14.852
She's not.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.222
It's strange.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.854
You know what's stranger?
She dared us to convict.

38:18.929 --> 38:20.658
She almost
admitted killing him.

38:20.731 --> 38:23.359
Our case gets weaker,
she wants to plead.

38:23.868 --> 38:26.803
Some mothers will do anything
to protect a child.

38:28.873 --> 38:31.034
You're saying the daughter
killed Decker?

38:31.108 --> 38:33.133
I'm saying it's a possibility.

38:33.744 --> 38:35.507
The DNA was a match
with Angela.

38:35.579 --> 38:36.807
80 percent.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.907
And where does a daughter
get her DNA from, anyway?

38:39.984 --> 38:42.145
The cops
searched the apartment.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.448
Why was the underwear
still there,

38:44.522 --> 38:46.422
why didn't Brant get rid of it?

38:46.757 --> 38:49.282
Because she didn't know it
mattered until they found it.

38:51.495 --> 38:54.055
Let's get a blood sample
on the daughter.

38:54.131 --> 38:57.362
Did anybody even
consider the possibility?

38:57.435 --> 38:59.130
Adam, we all made
the same assumption.

38:59.203 --> 39:01.103
We thought the underwear
was the mother's.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.403
When did we turn this office
over to the Marx Brothers?

39:05.242 --> 39:08.871
First, nobody checks out
this husband's custody suit

39:08.946 --> 39:10.470
and now it turns out

39:10.548 --> 39:13.016
that nobody checked
whose bloomers were whose.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.052
You're going for a record here.

39:15.119 --> 39:16.746
So what's the theory?

39:17.254 --> 39:19.449
Mother walks in,
finds the daughter,

39:19.523 --> 39:21.650
stabs Decker
in front of her. That it?

39:21.726 --> 39:23.956
Liz thinks it's possible
that the daughter did it.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.086
Where was the mother?

39:25.162 --> 39:26.720
I think she was
with the ex-husband.

39:26.797 --> 39:29.459
The husband testified
she wasrt with him.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.797
Cerreta and Logan
asked Brant where she was.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.769
She didn't know
the daughter killed Decker.

39:33.838 --> 39:34.964
She tells the truth.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.870
Says she was with her ex.
He backs her up.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.169
Not in court.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.266
But try this.

39:39.343 --> 39:41.504
He changed his mind
after she told him to.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.274
She wanted to look guilty.

39:43.347 --> 39:44.905
He tells the truth
the first time,

39:44.982 --> 39:46.711
then lies on the stand.

39:48.619 --> 39:49.984
Both lying.

39:50.354 --> 39:52.788
Protecting the kid. Good.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.351
DNA match on the daughter.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.692
Irrefutable. 100 percent.

40:04.335 --> 40:05.461
Okay.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.395
Only way this works now

40:08.973 --> 40:10.565
is to put husband
and wife together

40:10.641 --> 40:12.006
at the time of the killing.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.737
Can you prove that?

40:17.114 --> 40:19.309
It's called perjury,
Mr. Brant.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.578
You might want
to call your lawyer.

40:21.852 --> 40:22.978
You can't prove anything.

40:23.053 --> 40:24.577
You don't know
where Angela was.

40:24.655 --> 40:26.122
I think we do.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.522
We also know
where your daughter was.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.719
We're going to indict Tracy
for murder, Mr. Brant.

40:34.832 --> 40:36.094
She'll be arraigned,

40:36.167 --> 40:38.260
she'll be surrounded
by reporters.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.264
Unless you'd like
to make this easier.

40:41.338 --> 40:42.737
Oh, you mean easier for you.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.604
For your daughter.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.199
And if there's
any hope of leniency,

40:46.277 --> 40:47.835
you'd better talk now.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.115
Oh, God.

41:03.527 --> 41:05.518
I did what Angela told me.

41:07.264 --> 41:08.993
I met her for dinner.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.200
She knew about Tracy
and Decker.

41:11.268 --> 41:13.566
She wanted my help.
I didn't know what to do.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.628
How late were you together?

41:16.974 --> 41:20.102
She walked away, she was mad.

41:21.245 --> 41:24.078
I started to leave.
I felt guilty, I went back.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.251
We went to the bar
on the corner.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.115
We were there till 9:00.

41:31.555 --> 41:33.853
So you told the police
the truth.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.187
Yeah. Angela called

41:40.264 --> 41:42.095
after they searched
her apartment.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.132
She said if they asked again,
I should tell them I lied.

41:46.737 --> 41:48.602
That I wasrt with her.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.931
She was willing to go to jail.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.007
Anything to save Tracy.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.738
You don't have a case
on either of them.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.340
We're dismissing
on Mrs. Brant

42:00.417 --> 42:02.078
and arresting her daughter.

42:02.152 --> 42:03.779
You can't prove Tracy did it.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.755
With what your husband told us
this morning, I think we can.

42:12.663 --> 42:14.756
She didn't understand

42:15.866 --> 42:18.096
that you couldn't
have everything.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.870
That life wasrt like that.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.343
How do you tell a child?

42:32.883 --> 42:35.545
I have no authority
to deal for Tracy, Ben.

42:36.253 --> 42:39.154
But I know that the girl's
had a lot of problems.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.616
I understand,
but she also killed a man.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.057
When you know
what he did to her,

42:43.127 --> 42:45.061
you won't be thinking 25 years.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.562
Sentence her as a juvenile.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.066
Convince me.

42:54.672 --> 42:55.934
You have a daughter, Ben.

42:56.006 --> 42:58.531
You know 15 is not an adult.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.440
She's not responsible.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.737
Would you excuse us, please?

43:14.758 --> 43:15.952
You knew.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.554
She never told me,
I never asked.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.462
Until she wanted a deal.

43:21.732 --> 43:24.030
I knew she had to be
either stupid or a martyr.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.830
She was not stupid.

43:28.238 --> 43:30.399
I'll get the case assignment.

43:30.808 --> 43:32.275
Talk to the girl.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.578
I know I'm pretty.

43:39.650 --> 43:41.743
I'm just not
that good with boys.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.014
Oh, they're gross.

43:44.221 --> 43:46.451
Just never wanted
to go out with them.

43:47.758 --> 43:48.747
Um...

43:49.793 --> 43:52.091
but Julian took me to clubs.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.763
I mean, I went to
the opening of Arena.

43:56.734 --> 43:58.668
He introduced me to everybody.

44:00.871 --> 44:02.099
Tracy,

44:03.107 --> 44:06.304
tell Mr. Stone
what Julian promised you.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.441
He was grooming me.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.214
He said
we'd always be together,

44:16.286 --> 44:18.618
and I was going
to be a big model.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.556
What happened
that night, Tracy?

44:30.834 --> 44:32.233
We made love.

44:35.272 --> 44:38.764
And then he told me to leave
and never come back again.

44:42.112 --> 44:43.909
It was my mom's fault.

44:47.217 --> 44:48.844
She told him

44:50.521 --> 44:52.955
that if he didn't stop
seeing me,

44:55.893 --> 44:57.326
she wouldn't...

45:00.698 --> 45:03.531
Angela said she'd quit
working for him.

45:04.668 --> 45:07.159
She threatened
to have him arrested.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.401
Decker told Tracy

45:12.910 --> 45:15.276
that her mother
was won'th more to him

45:15.345 --> 45:16.744
as a prostitute,

45:17.748 --> 45:20.080
than she ever
would be as a model.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.650
I didn't mean to do it.

45:31.929 --> 45:35.057
After what he said about Mom,
he made fun of me.

45:37.434 --> 45:39.698
He said I wasrt pretty enough.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.473
My legs were too heavy.

45:48.779 --> 45:51.612
He just turned his back on me.

45:53.016 --> 45:55.883
He just walked away.

46:12.936 --> 46:16.770
Three years. Spofford.
With treatment.

46:22.746 --> 46:24.236
15 years old.

46:24.314 --> 46:26.714
She thought if her picture
was on a magazine cover,

46:26.784 --> 46:28.183
her life would be perfect.

46:28.252 --> 46:30.880
Aborigines think
if you take their picture,

46:30.954 --> 46:32.387
you capture their soul.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.117
Maybe they're right.
