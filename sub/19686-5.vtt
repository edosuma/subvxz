00:01.015 --> 00:02.014
Narrator: Sugar,

00:02.016 --> 00:04.009
spice...

00:04.011 --> 00:06.013
and everything nice.

00:06.015 --> 00:08.004
These were
the ingredients chosen

00:08.006 --> 00:10.004
to create
the perfect little girl.

00:10.006 --> 00:12.016
But Professor Utonium
accidentally added

00:12.018 --> 00:15.002
an extra ingredient
to the concoction--

00:15.004 --> 00:17.005
Chemical-X.

00:17.007 --> 00:19.018
[Explosion]

00:19.020 --> 00:22.018
Thus the Powerpuff Girls
were born!

00:22.020 --> 00:24.011
Using their ultra-superpowers,

00:24.013 --> 00:28.010
Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup
have dedicated their lives

00:28.012 --> 00:32.014
to fighting crime
and the forces of evil!

01:14.026 --> 01:18.010
Narrator: The city of Townsville
in all of its glory.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.028
It is the setting
of this little story.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.015
Let us begin on the back
of the globe,

01:23.017 --> 01:27.019
where people
are dressed in P.J. and robe.

01:27.021 --> 01:30.021
They kick off their slippers
and climb into beds,

01:30.023 --> 01:33.028
fluff up their pillows,
and lay down their heads.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.016
Now everyone is ready
to sleep for the night.

01:36.018 --> 01:40.023
Enter the Sandman
to do them up right.

01:40.025 --> 01:43.014
Reaching into his bag
with his free hand,

01:43.016 --> 01:46.014
he pulls out a magical
brown grain of sand.

01:46.016 --> 01:48.018
A piece in the eyes,
the left and the right,

01:48.020 --> 01:51.026
and out goes the victim,
asleep for the night.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.014
And so on to every home
in every city,

01:54.016 --> 01:57.026
the Sandman does his job,
singing his ditty.

01:57.028 --> 02:01.029
Sandman: ♪ I'm a little Sandman,
that's no doubt ♪

02:02.001 --> 02:05.013
♪ Puttin' you to sleep
is what I'm about ♪

02:05.015 --> 02:09.019
♪ When your eyes get heavy,
don't you pout ♪

02:09.021 --> 02:14.009
♪ I'll show up
and put you out ♪

02:14.011 --> 02:17.016
♪ Sha ma na na
la la la la la ♪

02:17.018 --> 02:21.021
Narrator: The Sandman finishes
with no time to spare,

02:21.023 --> 02:24.029
and poof! He disappears
back to his lair.

02:25.001 --> 02:27.009
Just as soon as
the Sandman gets back,

02:27.011 --> 02:30.004
he scratches his fanny
and heads for the sack.

02:30.006 --> 02:32.023
But before he can reach
that place so desired,

02:32.025 --> 02:35.006
again he must go
where sleep is required.

02:35.008 --> 02:38.012
Clang! Clang! Clang!
Goes the alarm.
Oh, what a pain.

02:38.014 --> 02:41.001
It seems they're going
to bed in Ukraine.

02:41.003 --> 02:43.011
That task done,
it's time to get going.

02:43.013 --> 02:47.014
Look at those eyes.
I think that's fatigue showing.

02:47.016 --> 02:49.025
So back to the sanctity
of his lair

02:49.027 --> 02:52.015
for some well-deserved sleep.
It's only fair.

02:52.017 --> 02:55.011
As he's about to catch up on
the sleep that he's missed,

02:55.013 --> 02:58.000
off goes the mini alarm
he wears on his wrist.

02:58.002 --> 03:00.025
Who is it now pulling him
away from his home?

03:00.027 --> 03:04.008
Why, it's the Italians going
<i>el snoozo</i><i>in Rome.</i>

03:04.010 --> 03:06.020
Adhering to the schedule
he has stuck to,

03:06.022 --> 03:11.001
off he goes to put them
asleep in Timbuktu.

03:11.003 --> 03:13.028
Hitting every city in the world,
it's no joke--

03:14.000 --> 03:17.008
London, Paris, Cairo,
even Royal Oak.

03:17.010 --> 03:20.020
So it goes 24 hours a day
without pause,

03:20.022 --> 03:24.026
365 nights a year,
unlike that Santy Claus.

03:24.028 --> 03:27.026
Meanwhile, back in the city
we all love and know--

03:27.028 --> 03:30.017
more specifically,
the Utonium chateau--

03:30.019 --> 03:32.011
where the girls
are still making a clatter,

03:32.013 --> 03:35.021
in pops the Professor
to see what's the matter.

03:35.023 --> 03:38.018
Girls,
what's the noise?
It's time for bed.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.026
We're not
sleepy.

03:39.028 --> 03:41.021
We want to stay up
instead.

03:41.023 --> 03:44.021
Well, you know,
that's all dandy
and fine.

03:44.023 --> 03:47.014
Into bed.
That's the
bottom line.

03:47.016 --> 03:48.025
Girls: But, Professor--

03:48.027 --> 03:50.011
No buts,
and I mean it.

03:50.013 --> 03:52.015
Does anybody want
a peanut?

03:52.017 --> 03:55.028
I want you
in bed. That's
my final warning.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.029
Don't you know
I've got work
in the morning?

03:58.001 --> 04:00.013
Narrator: And with that,
he closes the door tight

04:00.015 --> 04:02.020
and tucks himself in
to sleep for the night.

04:02.022 --> 04:05.009
Back in his lair,
the Sandman tries the same.

04:05.011 --> 04:08.015
But off goes the alarm--
Townsville to blame.

04:08.017 --> 04:11.009
That's it!
No more! I quit!

04:11.011 --> 04:13.023
I never get to sleep,
and I'm tired of it!

04:13.025 --> 04:16.022
Wait! I've an idea
that just might work...

04:16.024 --> 04:19.006
He said with an evil,
toothy kind of smirk.

04:19.008 --> 04:22.028
I'll build a machine.
Oh, this is so clever.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.014
A machine that will put
them all to sleep forever!

04:30.003 --> 04:32.012
And so it is built
just as he planned,

04:32.014 --> 04:35.001
a machine to sprinkle
the world with his sand.

04:35.003 --> 04:38.001
He punches the numbers
and pulls down the handle.

04:40.003 --> 04:43.003
Out goes the world,
just like a candle.

04:46.027 --> 04:50.008
I did it! I did it!
Now I can hit the hay!

04:50.010 --> 04:53.019
I think I'll sleep
an extra 17 hours a day.

04:53.021 --> 04:56.001
Narrator: But before he can
enjoy the fruit of his pains,

04:56.003 --> 04:59.002
off goes the alarm.
Someone remains.

04:59.004 --> 05:00.027
Oh! Who's still awake?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.010
He said with remorse.

05:02.012 --> 05:05.028
Why, it's the Powerpuff Girls,
with insomnia, of course.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.004
Oh, those brats
are ruining my ploy.

05:09.006 --> 05:11.022
By staying awake,
they're stealing my joy!

05:11.024 --> 05:14.022
I'll pay them a visit--
a little house call--

05:14.024 --> 05:18.015
And take care of this matter
once and for all!

05:18.017 --> 05:20.025
Back in their room,
the girls continue playing,

05:20.027 --> 05:23.001
when all of a sudden,
they hear someone saying...

05:23.003 --> 05:25.021
Sandman: You 3 girls
are ruining my plan.

05:25.023 --> 05:28.023
Now, get into bed
as quick as you can!

05:28.025 --> 05:29.028
Who are you to make us?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.014
Buttercup did exclaim.

05:31.016 --> 05:34.007
Why, I'm the Sandman--
the one and the same.

05:34.009 --> 05:37.004
I come to you now
with only one dream,

05:37.006 --> 05:40.004
which is why
I hatched up this
wonderful scheme.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.009
I want to sleep and doze
and slumber and nap,

05:43.011 --> 05:46.010
so I put the world
to sleep. It was a snap.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.004
Forever they'll sleep.
That, I've no doubt.

05:49.006 --> 05:52.020
And you 3 girls
I'll also put out!

05:52.022 --> 05:55.006
We've got to stop
this awful oppressor!

05:55.008 --> 05:57.016
Bubbles, Buttercup,
wake the Professor!

05:57.018 --> 06:00.010
You can try
and wake him,
try as you might,

06:00.012 --> 06:03.011
but I guarantee you,
he's out like a light.

06:03.013 --> 06:05.014
Narrator: To put them to sleep
is the reason he came,

06:05.016 --> 06:08.005
so he pulls out his weapon
and takes sharp aim.

06:08.007 --> 06:10.011
The girls fly up
in typical formation

06:10.013 --> 06:12.027
to stop the Sandman
and his evil creation.

06:12.029 --> 06:15.012
Sandman: Hold still, now!
I've just about enough!

06:15.014 --> 06:18.002
Blossom: You can't
hurt us, because
we're the Powerpuff--

06:18.004 --> 06:20.005
Narrator: But before the girls
can finish their call,

06:20.007 --> 06:22.022
the Sandman finishes them
once and for all.

06:22.024 --> 06:25.028
Victory is mine!
I've won,
that's who.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.018
Now there's only
one thing left
for me to do.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.023
And with that,
he vanishes in thin air--

06:31.025 --> 06:34.003
Most likely to sleep
back at his lair.

06:34.005 --> 06:36.009
So I guess that's it.
What can I say?

06:36.011 --> 06:39.026
Oh, who would have thought
it would have ended this way?

06:39.028 --> 06:42.022
[Girls snoring]

06:42.024 --> 06:45.015
Hey, what are
you two doing in
one of my dreams?

06:45.017 --> 06:48.010
We're having
each other's,
or so it seems.

06:48.012 --> 06:50.008
This is a power
I never knew we had.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.010
It's totally
cool!

06:51.012 --> 06:52.025
Yeah. It ain't
half bad.

06:52.027 --> 06:55.004
But let's get down to
the matter at hand--

06:55.006 --> 06:57.022
how to defeat
that dispenser of sand.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.029
Why don't we just go
and beat him right up?

07:00.001 --> 07:02.006
Always the violent way,
eh, Buttercup?

07:02.008 --> 07:04.017
I've got an idea.
It's way out
of sight.

07:04.019 --> 07:07.012
We'll infiltrate
his dreams and
give him a fright.

07:07.014 --> 07:09.016
Yeah, scare him so bad
that he'll never

07:09.018 --> 07:12.009
want to sleep again!
Bubbles, you're clever!

07:12.011 --> 07:14.012
Careful, Bubbles.
Your ego is showing.

07:14.014 --> 07:15.009
What? Where?

07:15.011 --> 07:17.002
Come on.
Let's get going!

07:18.020 --> 07:21.010

[Alarm bell ringing]

10:07.016 --> 10:08.028
Aaaaahhhhh!

10:09.000 --> 10:11.026
I'm awake! Please stay out
of my dreams.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.009
Never again
will I hatch any schemes.

10:14.011 --> 10:16.029
I'm throwing the switch
and hitting the number

10:17.001 --> 10:19.014
and awaking them all
from eternal slumber.

10:19.016 --> 10:22.008
Oh, would you look at the time?
I got to get cracking.

10:22.010 --> 10:25.026
People are waiting.
My, I've been slacking.

10:25.028 --> 10:28.007
Narrator: And off he goes,
off to his job,

10:28.009 --> 10:30.019
never to sleep again,
the poor slob.

10:30.021 --> 10:33.004
The world awakes
without missing a beat,

10:33.006 --> 10:35.008
unaware of
the Sandman's defeat.

10:35.010 --> 10:38.009
[All speaking
native language]

10:43.018 --> 10:46.001
Yay!
We did it!
We're awake!

10:46.003 --> 10:49.012
I'm pooped.
Let's hit the
hay...
For goodness' sake.

10:49.014 --> 10:52.003
Narrator: And finally,
for all their troubles,

10:52.005 --> 10:59.000
they deserve to sleep--
Buttercup, Blossom, and Bubbles.

11:02.021 --> 11:05.006
[Rooster crowing]

11:05.008 --> 11:06.001

11:06.003 --> 11:07.012
It's morning, girls.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.007
Oh, how the night
sure flies.

11:09.009 --> 11:12.003
Wake up and rub
the sand from your eyes.

11:13.012 --> 11:16.002
Narrator:
Oh, Professor, perhaps
you'd better turn around,

11:16.004 --> 11:18.013
because while the rest of us
were sleeping sound,

11:18.015 --> 11:20.025
the Earth was saved
just as it twirls,

11:20.027 --> 11:24.010
thanks again
to the Powerpuff Girls.

11:38.019 --> 11:42.011
Narrator: The city of Townsville
has brushed its teeth

11:42.013 --> 11:45.015
and tucked itself into
the warm blanket of night.

11:45.017 --> 11:50.012
But as the city dreams,
a monkey schemes.

11:54.007 --> 11:55.028
Yes. Yes.

Yes! Yes!

12:04.016 --> 12:06.001

where I sit poised
with laser gun.

12:08.004 --> 12:10.009
I activate beam,
and the girls...

12:10.011 --> 12:13.016
fly away. Aaaahhh!

12:13.018 --> 12:17.015
That's where this otherwise
brilliant plan falls apart!

12:17.017 --> 12:22.008
I must find a way
to keep them from
flying away! Hmm.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.000
Ooh! How about flypaper?

12:25.002 --> 12:27.016
No. That's stupid. No.

It's the Amoeba Boys,

13:31.024 --> 13:34.018
Townsville's most pathetic
criminals ever.

13:34.020 --> 13:38.011
They couldn't
commit a crime even if it
smacked them in the face.

and numbers.

what this is?

hunt list!

14:43.014 --> 14:46.016
Oh, a scavenger hunt?
How terrible.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.018
