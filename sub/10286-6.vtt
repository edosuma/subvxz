WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:07.981
That's it.

00:09.691 --> 00:11.283
- How much?
- A buck.

00:11.726 --> 00:13.318
- You're kidding.
- Each.

00:13.795 --> 00:17.492
What? I've never paid
more than 75 cents for a shine.

00:17.899 --> 00:21.664
Don't blame me, mister.
The whole industry's being deregulated.

00:22.002 --> 00:25.961
Oh, would you look at that? All I got
is a 100. I'll have to get some change.

00:26.139 --> 00:28.903
- Listen, you catch me later, okay?
- But...

00:29.076 --> 00:31.135
Court's in session.

00:36.850 --> 00:39.614
This is boring, Miss Wagner.

00:39.786 --> 00:41.651
Yes, sir.

00:42.556 --> 00:45.081
I am really bored.

00:45.459 --> 00:47.483
And another one.

00:48.294 --> 00:50.194
Don't you ever get bored, Lana?

00:50.463 --> 00:54.058
I mean, don't you ever just feel like doing
something crazy? You know, like:

00:56.769 --> 00:58.498
Not exactly like that.

00:58.671 --> 01:01.663
Oh, come one. When's the last time
you did something crazy?

01:01.841 --> 01:04.810
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- Oh, come on.

01:05.376 --> 01:07.845
Well...

01:09.315 --> 01:11.374
There was this one time about a month ago.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.518
You know, I was home,
and I was feeling a little silly.

01:14.686 --> 01:17.951
And I decided to try on
my old Girl Scout uniform.

01:19.390 --> 01:23.793
Anyway, I did, and Emerson came over,
and he saw me...

01:23.962 --> 01:27.420
...and he liked it, and he...

01:30.201 --> 01:32.863
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:33.271 --> 01:36.069
Let me guess. He bought the cookies.

01:37.675 --> 01:39.575
Next case, Your Honor.

01:40.445 --> 01:43.709
- Good evening, Your Honor.
- Counselors. Who have we got here?

01:44.448 --> 01:47.542
- You tell him.
- I am known by many names.

01:47.718 --> 01:50.846
Pick one and tell it to the judge.

01:51.488 --> 01:56.050
I've been called the Final Cause,
the Supreme Judge, the Infinite Spirit...

01:56.226 --> 01:58.592
...but you can just call me God.

01:59.863 --> 02:02.525
You've been saving this one for me,
haven't you?

02:02.699 --> 02:04.667
I chose to manifest myself in this form...

02:04.835 --> 02:07.769
...because I didn't want my presence
to be noticed.

02:07.937 --> 02:09.996
Good choice.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.307
To what do we owe this visit?

02:12.675 --> 02:15.508
The ways of the Lord surpass
thine understanding.

02:15.678 --> 02:20.047
Unto mankind,
my ways are wondrous strange.

02:20.316 --> 02:24.252
- I give. How strange?
- He trashed a diner.

02:24.754 --> 02:26.153
Any particular reason?

02:26.389 --> 02:28.823
The defendant went
into Blumberg's Coffee Shop...

02:28.991 --> 02:31.960
...and there he said unto Blumberg:

02:32.495 --> 02:35.258
"Give me an egg-salad sandwich,
for though I have no cash...

02:35.430 --> 02:38.831
...you and all your descendants
will be blessed."

02:39.434 --> 02:41.959
It's better when I do it.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.904
Blumberg was unimpressed
and told him to leave.

02:45.073 --> 02:49.567
And then he told Blumberg
to be fruitful and multiply.

02:50.612 --> 02:52.807
But not in those words.

02:55.517 --> 02:58.714
- Your Honor, may I approach the bench?
- Yeah.

02:59.688 --> 03:02.417
My client is obviously unbalanced.

03:02.590 --> 03:05.889
I took the liberty of placing a call
to Bellevue for an ambulance.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.220
Mr. Prosecutor?

03:07.394 --> 03:11.091
The people agree
he's a few quarts low, Your Honor.

03:11.265 --> 03:14.530
You're gonna look good as a pillar of salt.

03:15.369 --> 03:19.271
The court hereby continues this case
for an indefinite period...

03:19.440 --> 03:22.967
...until an evaluation is made
of the defendant's fitness to stand trial.

03:23.143 --> 03:25.475
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Follow this gentleman...

03:25.646 --> 03:29.206
...if you please.
- Everything pleases me...

03:29.382 --> 03:31.714
...except John Denver.

03:33.453 --> 03:35.887
Your Honor, pending the
psychiatric examination...

03:36.055 --> 03:38.387
...the state moves to put this case...

03:39.225 --> 03:43.218
The day of destruction is here!
Rise up! Rise up and flee!

03:43.396 --> 03:45.057
Sit down. Sit down. Don't flee.

03:45.231 --> 03:47.995
- This just in.
- What is it?

03:50.003 --> 03:51.834
Appears to be a death threat.

03:52.005 --> 03:56.873
- A death threat?
- Yeah. "Dear Scum." It's for you, Harry.

04:00.145 --> 04:03.376
"Death to Judge Stone.
Death to Judge Stone."

04:03.548 --> 04:05.072
Yeah. It's for me, all right.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.343
I don't believe this. A threatening rock...

04:07.519 --> 04:09.919
...thrown into a court?
What's this world coming to?

04:10.088 --> 04:13.421
I will see what their end shall be.
I will spend my arrows upon them.

04:13.592 --> 04:16.891
I will set on fire the foundations
of their mountains.

04:17.062 --> 04:20.361
You do, and you'll answer to me.

05:03.206 --> 05:05.902
They climbed the fire escape
and threw it from the ledge...

05:06.076 --> 05:08.840
...right below the window.
- I can't believe that someone...

05:09.012 --> 05:11.537
- Harry, get away from the window.
- Lana, come on now.

05:11.715 --> 05:14.878
I admit it's scary, but it's probably
just a prank or something.

05:15.051 --> 05:20.818
A prank? You call "wanting to tear
your eyes out of their sockets" a prank?

05:21.056 --> 05:24.992
- I didn't remember that part.
- Whoever it is has really bad penmanship.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.323
Yeah. You can barely make out
"dead meat."

05:30.833 --> 05:34.394
No luck, Your Honor. I ran downstairs,
but I must have just missed him.

05:34.570 --> 05:38.233
- You ran down 18 flights of stairs?
- Yeah.

05:38.407 --> 05:41.069
I figured he threw it
from the ledge under the window.

05:41.243 --> 05:44.268
I ran downstairs on the hypothesis
that me and the perpetrator...

05:44.445 --> 05:46.310
...would hit the street at the same time.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.882
- Not bad.
- But about the fourth floor...

05:49.050 --> 05:51.450
...it occurred to me
he'd just slip into the crowd.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.745
- Oh, right.
- Then again, I figured there was a chance...

05:54.922 --> 05:57.083
...that the sight of me
barreling out of here...

05:57.258 --> 05:59.783
...might cause him to panic and flee,
then I'd nab him.

05:59.961 --> 06:03.522
- So, what happened?
- Everyone panicked and fled.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.197
Thanks, Bull. I appreciate the effort.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.495
Can I have a minute
before court starts? I'd like to freshen up.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.661
Sure. Go ahead.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.205
A person would have to be
seriously deranged...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.172
...to actually do this stuff.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.507
Know anyone like that in Manhattan?

06:21.181 --> 06:24.344
The courtroom's been cleared, Your Honor.
Whenever you're ready.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.849
Thanks, Selma.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.454
Well, shall we go out there
and try to dispense some justice?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.553
Don't worry, sir.
I'm sure nothing will happen.

06:33.727 --> 06:38.163
And this may be small comfort, but,
on a personal note, I'd like you to know...

06:38.330 --> 06:40.560
...you're not without friends.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.199
Thanks.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.335
- That was sweet.
- I've got dibs on his parking space.

06:49.475 --> 06:53.206
- I'm looking for Harold T. Stone.
- I'm Harry Stone.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.812
Must have just grazed you, huh?

06:54.980 --> 06:58.472
- Excuse me. Who are you?
- Womack. Homicide.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.718
Look, there must be some mistake.

07:00.886 --> 07:03.752
Some babe called and said there was
an attempt on your life.

07:04.689 --> 07:05.986
Lana?

07:06.157 --> 07:08.421
Officer, I may have given
you the impression...

07:08.593 --> 07:10.390
...that there was an attempt, but...

07:10.562 --> 07:13.929
Oh, you said there was an attempt.

07:14.799 --> 07:19.259
- Well, it's only a matter of time.
- Meanwhile, all we have is this.

07:19.437 --> 07:20.870
It came in through the window.

07:21.773 --> 07:23.172
Oh, yeah?

07:24.109 --> 07:25.940
Could be a rock.

07:27.212 --> 07:29.806
Yes, and what are you
going to do about it?

07:29.981 --> 07:33.381
Huh? Well, until he makes his move,
nothing.

07:33.550 --> 07:36.212
But when he does, it's a promise:

07:36.386 --> 07:39.583
He gets you, we'll get him.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.156
The object here
is to prevent that from happening.

07:42.326 --> 07:45.762
Lana, you cannot take one threatening letter
so seriously.

07:45.929 --> 07:48.227
That's what the late Judge Cranston said.

07:48.499 --> 07:51.559
- He did?
- Yeah. Course, you could get lucky...

07:51.768 --> 07:55.898
...and he might miss you. Took them
three whacks to snuff that judge in Florida.

07:56.173 --> 07:59.471
- Did he get a rock too?
- Rattlesnake in the mailbox.

07:59.642 --> 08:02.805
- Clipped off the rattle so he couldn't hear it.
- Oh, that's awful.

08:03.112 --> 08:06.275
No. A snake just shrugs
a thing like that off.

08:07.216 --> 08:10.982
Anyway, the point of the story is that if
somebody wants to kill you bad enough...

08:11.154 --> 08:14.885
...there ain't nothing you can do about it.
So have a nice day.

08:15.057 --> 08:16.854
Thanks.

08:17.660 --> 08:22.427
- Hey... see you.
- See you.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.103
You know, if it weren't for Eve, there'd be
no reason for you to wear any clothes.

08:30.272 --> 08:34.402
She did it so we could
get some work done.

08:34.676 --> 08:38.077
Tell me, do you worship regularly?

08:38.246 --> 08:42.443
Honey, at my age,
I don't do anything regularly.

08:47.722 --> 08:50.054
Hey, mister,
you got any change yet?

08:50.225 --> 08:52.624
No. I haven't had a chance to get it yet.

08:54.295 --> 08:57.492
I told you, you would get it.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.893
I don't suppose you take Diners Club?

09:02.236 --> 09:04.329
Cash, chump.

09:04.572 --> 09:06.369
Chump.

09:06.774 --> 09:12.110
Come here. Come. Come here.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.776
Here you go.

09:18.384 --> 09:20.215
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

09:20.386 --> 09:23.947
Just a little advice, Your Honor.
Get a bulletproof vest.

09:24.123 --> 09:26.023
Bull, I appreciate the concern, but...

09:26.192 --> 09:29.093
I took a bullet in the stomach once
from three feet.

09:29.262 --> 09:32.254
- Sounds like you were real lucky.
- Yeah. A few inches higher...

09:32.432 --> 09:34.366
...and I could have been hurt.

09:34.767 --> 09:37.099
Bull, I think I'm just gonna
take my chances.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.135
Life is an adventure. Let's face it.

09:39.305 --> 09:42.001
You never know when you're gonna
step in front of a bus...

09:42.175 --> 09:44.836
...or you're gonna eat the bad mushroom
in the bunch.

09:45.010 --> 09:48.207
Or, for that matter,
when you're going to run into...

09:49.047 --> 09:51.015
One of those things.

10:06.265 --> 10:08.733
Okay, folks.
You can come on back in now.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.027
- It's all clear.
- Are you sure it's all right?

10:11.203 --> 10:14.763
Sure. Come on in. Here, catch.

10:16.007 --> 10:18.475
Bomb-squad humor.

10:18.709 --> 10:22.372
I'm always clowning around like that.
Helps ease the tension.

10:22.780 --> 10:26.045
Didn't take you long
to dismantle this sucker, did it?

10:26.217 --> 10:31.052
That particular device
is status nonfunctional.

10:31.222 --> 10:34.385
- You mean it's a fake?
- In layman's terms, yes.

10:34.558 --> 10:38.618
You see, it's just some highway flares
with a cheap alarm clock.

10:38.795 --> 10:43.164
- Sure looked real enough to me.
- Well, but to the practiced eye...

10:43.333 --> 10:46.302
You've gotta realize I've been
in the explosive-disposal game...

10:46.469 --> 10:49.165
...for nearly a quarter of a century.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.473
- No kidding?
- Without a major mishap, I might add.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.780
- Hey, Lou, how are you?
- Womack.

10:59.949 --> 11:02.747
All right. Say, how's your partner Earl?

11:02.919 --> 11:04.386
Oh, he's fine.

11:04.621 --> 11:06.645
- So, you're all set, then.
- Really?

11:06.822 --> 11:10.519
Hey, I heard he got it pretty bad
in that drugstore blast.

11:10.693 --> 11:13.560
Womack, I'm with a customer.

11:13.929 --> 11:15.794
A little paperwork and I'll be gone.

11:15.964 --> 11:18.057
I just wanna know if Earl is okay,
that's all.

11:18.233 --> 11:20.565
If I could just get you to sign right here.

11:21.203 --> 11:23.671
They let him out of the hospital
a couple of days ago.

11:23.839 --> 11:27.468
- That's great. So, what's he up to?
- The alphabet.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.875
He's working with
some kind of therapist.

11:34.382 --> 11:37.180
- I'll have to get a pen.
- Oh, here you go.

11:40.555 --> 11:43.023
Here. Help yourself.

11:48.363 --> 11:51.196
- Thanks. We'll be seeing you.
- Bye.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.661
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:55.937 --> 11:57.700
Goodbye.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.834
- Hey, kid.
- Don't hit me.

12:05.912 --> 12:07.903
What a card.

12:08.081 --> 12:10.015
Listen, I finally got some change, okay?

12:10.183 --> 12:11.673
Got two fifties.

12:12.319 --> 12:15.846
- I can't change a fifty.
- Too bad.

12:16.223 --> 12:20.091
- Hey, mister!
- Tax loss. Think about it.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.463
Harry?

12:26.399 --> 12:27.730
Are you all right?

12:29.135 --> 12:31.626
It's a strange feeling,
thinking about the fact...

12:31.804 --> 12:34.602
...that somebody might actually
want you dead.

12:34.907 --> 12:38.934
Harry, listen, maybe you were right before.
I mean, the bomb was a fake, wasn't it?

12:39.512 --> 12:40.945
This time.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.478
- I don't want...
- I know you can't please all the people...

12:44.650 --> 12:46.982
...but I do try to be fair in this job.

12:47.253 --> 12:48.743
You are.

12:49.455 --> 12:53.083
I need a couple of minutes to myself
to think, but our schedule...

12:53.258 --> 12:56.227
No. I'll take care of that.

12:56.394 --> 12:57.918
Your aspirin's in the top drawer.

12:58.096 --> 13:00.792
- Mel Tormé tapes underneath.
- Thanks.

13:03.301 --> 13:05.292
You can't let it stop you, young man.

13:05.537 --> 13:07.937
- You again?
- I'm everywhere.

13:08.106 --> 13:09.698
So I've heard.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.014
- Got a minute?
- Look, I'm really not qualified...

13:18.183 --> 13:20.650
...to help you, Mr...
- I know, you think I'm crazy.

13:20.818 --> 13:22.718
That wouldn't be the word
I'd have chosen.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.478
Oh, don't worry. I'm used to it.

13:24.655 --> 13:28.284
Imagine how Noah felt
when I laid that ark number on him.

13:28.692 --> 13:32.321
- Look, I really am busy.
- Then you won't let it stop you. Good.

13:32.496 --> 13:34.464
Not gonna let what stop me from what?

13:34.631 --> 13:36.724
This incident stop you
from doing your job.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.367
Doing what you were meant to do.

13:38.535 --> 13:41.026
I never said anything
about stopping my job.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.968
No, not out loud.

13:44.775 --> 13:47.334
A little parable.
Now stop me if you've heard it.

13:47.510 --> 13:51.241
Two hungry shepherds in a desert
with only one piece of fish to eat.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.609
- Please.
- Where did they get the fish, right?

13:53.783 --> 13:57.275
It's not important.
Anyway, the tall one says...

13:57.453 --> 14:01.549
- Did I mention one's taller than the other?
- Please, what is your point?

14:01.724 --> 14:04.454
If it's worthwhile, it's worth some risk.

14:04.727 --> 14:06.820
- Got it.
- When I tell it with the shepherds...

14:06.996 --> 14:09.055
...I get more yuks.

14:09.398 --> 14:11.889
Thanks. Maybe things will work out
just fine.

14:12.068 --> 14:16.231
- From your mouth to my ear.
- Right.

14:36.024 --> 14:39.892
- How are you guys doing?
- Oh, fine, Your Honor, but...

14:40.061 --> 14:42.893
...we were talking and thought
maybe you should consider...

14:43.063 --> 14:45.429
...just closing up shop for tonight.

14:45.633 --> 14:48.067
- Dan?
- A note you can almost laugh off...

14:48.235 --> 14:49.702
...but this isn't funny anymore.

14:49.870 --> 14:52.168
Well, you're right,
but what about tomorrow?

14:52.339 --> 14:54.364
Do we shut down
if something else happens?

14:54.542 --> 14:58.034
And what stops that?
Honestly, I don't know what to do.

14:58.379 --> 15:01.371
Well, it's creepy, but...

15:01.549 --> 15:02.777
Let's get on with it.

15:03.417 --> 15:04.748
Thanks.

15:06.053 --> 15:09.215
- Lf anything should happen to me.
- What?

15:10.089 --> 15:12.683
Make sure this goes with me.

15:13.826 --> 15:17.023
All right, people, if we could all find
a seat, please.

15:18.565 --> 15:22.296
Now, I know it has been a difficult
night, so before we begin...

15:22.468 --> 15:23.958
...I want to commend you all.

15:24.137 --> 15:28.073
You have shown amazing patience
and understanding...

15:33.146 --> 15:34.373
And reflexes.

15:35.814 --> 15:41.309
At any rate, it is my intention to proceed
here in spite of everything.

15:41.486 --> 15:45.684
Now, I know this is a little scary,
but what is the old saying?

15:45.857 --> 15:50.817
"A coward dies a thousand deaths,
a brave man only once."

15:52.064 --> 15:54.726
But then, once is enough, isn't it?

15:55.901 --> 15:58.802
Harry, Your Honor, I've got great news.

15:58.971 --> 16:00.336
I could use some. What is it?

16:00.505 --> 16:02.199
Down in the parking lot just now...

16:02.373 --> 16:06.070
...there was a guy under the hood of
your car, messing around with the wiring.

16:06.243 --> 16:08.734
Say, that is great news.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.614
No. The great part
is that the police caught him.

16:11.782 --> 16:13.647
He's the guy
who's been threatening you.

16:13.918 --> 16:16.079
- How do they know?
- He had another note...

16:16.253 --> 16:18.483
...in his pocket that matched
the death threat.

16:18.823 --> 16:20.882
And they're bringing him up
to your office.

16:21.392 --> 16:23.952
They're bringing him to my office? Why?

16:24.128 --> 16:25.561
I don't know.

16:27.331 --> 16:30.299
People, I know this court
hasn't conducted much business today...

16:30.467 --> 16:32.958
...and I appreciate your tolerance, but...

16:33.136 --> 16:35.696
- It's okay. We understand.
- Thanks.

16:43.780 --> 16:47.876
- So, Harry, what are you gonna do?
- What am I supposed to do?

16:48.051 --> 16:52.784
How am I supposed to act? What do
you say to somebody that wants to kill you?

16:52.956 --> 16:54.321
Come in.

16:56.258 --> 16:59.056
That would not have been my first choice.

16:59.595 --> 17:02.621
Your Honor, here's your man.

17:03.365 --> 17:05.026
So to speak.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.693
Oh, come on, sergeant. This is a kid.
This is no killer.

17:09.872 --> 17:11.669
Wait till you hear his prices.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.069
You mean this kid
was causing all the trouble?

17:16.478 --> 17:19.002
- What's your name?
- Anthony. That's all I'm saying...

17:19.181 --> 17:21.046
...till I talk to my lawyer.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.044
So, what did I do?
Why do you hate me so much?

17:24.218 --> 17:27.550
- Who said I did?
- Oh, sorry. Maybe I'm being sensitive.

17:27.722 --> 17:31.783
When your note said you wanted to kill me,
I jumped to the conclusion you hated me.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.291
- I didn't want to kill nobody.
- No?

17:34.462 --> 17:37.954
No. I just wanted to scare you.
Just a game.

17:38.366 --> 17:41.460
Does the name Parcheesi
mean anything to you?

17:42.203 --> 17:45.661
Does the name
Antonio Rodriguez mean anything to you?

17:45.940 --> 17:48.669
- No. I don't think so.
- That name means something to me.

17:48.842 --> 17:51.106
And you made it dirt
when you sent him to jail.

17:52.646 --> 17:54.944
Oh, it's his father.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.414
<i>Yeah. How did you figure that out, bruja?</i>

18:00.087 --> 18:01.679
<i>Bruja?</i>

18:01.855 --> 18:04.847
It means "witch."

18:06.460 --> 18:09.395
Antonio Rodriguez. Yes.
I remember him, Anthony.

18:09.563 --> 18:12.999
- Let's see. He committed...
- Burglary. Second degree.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.532
Burglary, that was it. I do remember him.
I remember him very well.

18:16.702 --> 18:18.727
- Don't you, Mr. Prosecutor?
- I see 1000...

18:18.904 --> 18:21.270
- Dan!
- Tall guy. Dark hair.

18:22.141 --> 18:24.974
In fact, I have your father's file
in my desk drawer, Anthony.

18:25.144 --> 18:29.240
- Sir, there aren't any files in your desk...
- Lana, this file is in my desk.

18:29.582 --> 18:32.278
- Oh, I get it.
- Here it is.

18:32.518 --> 18:35.419
"Rodriguez, Antonio."

18:35.588 --> 18:38.284
- Your father.
- Yeah, and now he's a crook too.

18:38.457 --> 18:41.187
Hey, he's just a guy
who made a mistake, Anthony.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.159
If it was just a mistake, how come he
couldn't just apologize and you let him go?

18:45.330 --> 18:47.764
Because some mistakes are tougher
to fix than others.

18:47.932 --> 18:51.333
And burglary is definitely one of them.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.363
I know this is gonna sound
like a crock...

18:54.539 --> 18:58.976
...but maybe this'll be good for your dad
if he uses this time while he's away...

18:59.144 --> 19:01.942
...to think about some stuff.
- What stuff?

19:02.347 --> 19:06.750
Stuff like, some things are too important
to risk another mistake on.

19:06.918 --> 19:11.047
- What's too important?
- Well, to your father, you are, Anthony.

19:11.255 --> 19:14.088
- That doesn't make sense.
- Look, it's very simple.

19:14.258 --> 19:16.783
Hey, I'm only eight, pineapple-face.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.786
That's a lifetime for some.

19:21.932 --> 19:24.924
Do you know why I had your father's
file in my drawer, Anthony?

19:25.102 --> 19:26.433
No. Why?

19:28.672 --> 19:32.403
You almost know what's going on,
don't you?

19:33.844 --> 19:37.404
I had this file because I was
gonna write a letter to the parole board...

19:37.580 --> 19:40.344
...recommending that your father
be released when eligible.

19:40.516 --> 19:41.744
Why would you do that?

19:41.918 --> 19:44.853
Because something he said
at the trial stuck with me.

19:45.221 --> 19:50.625
He said, "Your Honor,
I have a little boy that I love very much...

19:50.793 --> 19:54.820
...and if it takes the rest of my life,
I'm gonna make this up to him."

19:55.164 --> 19:57.997
My father said that?

19:58.167 --> 20:00.965
After I sentenced him,
so I know he meant it.

20:01.137 --> 20:02.570
Pretty impressive, huh?

20:03.071 --> 20:08.202
I'll say. I mean, I didn't even
know he could speak English.

20:12.848 --> 20:15.043
There was an interpreter there.

20:16.918 --> 20:20.752
That guy could charm the pants
off of anybody.

20:21.056 --> 20:24.150
- I mean, except...
- You. We know. Knock it off.

20:25.126 --> 20:27.356
Your Honor...

20:27.629 --> 20:30.791
...there's a major crime
committed every 10 seconds in this city.

20:30.965 --> 20:33.092
Now, if you're through coddling...

20:33.267 --> 20:37.727
Sure, sergeant. Would you do me a favor
and take him home on your way back?

20:38.272 --> 20:43.676
Yeah, yeah. I've been here six hours on the
job, and I haven't even found a corpse yet.

20:43.878 --> 20:45.846
You won't do anything like this again?

20:46.013 --> 20:48.072
- No, sir.
- And you know that what you did...

20:48.249 --> 20:52.811
...was not just a prank? Threatening
someone's life is serious business.

20:53.354 --> 20:57.312
Yes, sir, but if any of those kids at school
call my daddy a crook again...

20:57.490 --> 21:01.290
You tell them Judge Stone
says it ain't so.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.524
Okay. Thank you, Judge Stone.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.029
All right.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.866
Hey, kid.

21:09.802 --> 21:14.171
I found a couple of bucks
In my other pocket. Here.

21:14.340 --> 21:19.107
Oh, look, here's something
extra for you. Keep it.

21:19.979 --> 21:24.574
Gee. A whole dime.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.112
Thanks, mister.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.089
Harry, you made that little boy
very, very happy.

21:39.264 --> 21:42.392
- Well, I hope so.
- You did. You really did.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.864
But, Your Honor...

21:44.036 --> 21:47.767
...suppose his father isn't exactly like
the kind of man you described.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.836
Why wouldn't he be?

21:50.008 --> 21:53.067
- You mean that's the file of...
- Antonio Rodriguez.

21:53.244 --> 21:55.439
Yeah, Lana, where you been
the last 15 minutes?

21:56.614 --> 21:59.879
You mean the fact that that boy was here
and that you had this file...

22:00.051 --> 22:01.712
...in your desk was just...

22:02.119 --> 22:03.609
Fate?

22:03.854 --> 22:08.621
He told the truth. Brilliant.
I never suspected it.

22:08.793 --> 22:12.058
And the kid fell for it.

22:15.499 --> 22:17.329
You take care now.

22:17.734 --> 22:20.430
I've been watching you today,
young man. Not bad.

22:20.837 --> 22:23.965
- You do what you can.
- With what you have. That's right.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.040
Some people I give wisdom.

22:26.209 --> 22:28.040
Some people I give talent.

22:28.211 --> 22:31.009
Pia Zadora I gave nothing.

22:40.523 --> 22:42.150
Everything's locked up, Your Honor.

22:42.325 --> 22:43.724
Thanks, Bull. Good night.

22:43.893 --> 22:49.023
Yeah. Listen, I guess it was
kind of a rough night for you, huh?

22:50.099 --> 22:55.002
And I know the way you like, you know,
tricks and jokes and all that...

22:55.170 --> 22:57.502
...so, well...

22:57.973 --> 23:00.601
...I just wanted you to have this.

23:01.176 --> 23:02.700
Really?

23:03.379 --> 23:05.973
It says "peanut brittle."

23:06.281 --> 23:08.112
Yeah. Open it.

23:10.185 --> 23:12.118
Here goes.

23:17.058 --> 23:18.855
Bull, it's empty.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.329
I didn't think you could take it all at once.
