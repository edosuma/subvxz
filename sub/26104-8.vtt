00:02.854 --> 00:05.056
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:05.089 --> 00:06.123
- Your mom.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.727
- What the hell is wrong...

00:11.428 --> 00:13.631
I'm gonna fucking bury you--

00:13.665 --> 00:14.999
Ohh--

00:16.934 --> 00:18.903
*

00:18.936 --> 00:21.338
- We went after Dennis
and chased him onto Riz's land.

00:21.372 --> 00:23.808
About 50 yards in,
we hit soft earth.

00:23.841 --> 00:25.342
It was an old tunnel.

00:27.178 --> 00:28.279
- Vicki's place.

00:28.312 --> 00:29.413
- Need a hand there,
brother?

00:31.282 --> 00:32.850
- I got intel from EZ.

00:32.884 --> 00:35.152
He told me Galindo was being
detained at Calexico East.

00:35.186 --> 00:37.321
- Galindo hasn't pinged
in over 26 hours.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.691
- See if anyone
scooped him up.

00:41.358 --> 00:44.662
- Your deal is still in play.
For now.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.163
- I'm not here to kill you.

00:47.398 --> 00:48.666
- Cooperation.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.135
- Partners.

00:51.168 --> 00:53.705
- He's home.

00:56.407 --> 00:58.976
- Miguel.

00:59.010 --> 01:01.278
- Good evening, Mrs. Galindo.

01:03.681 --> 01:05.349
*

01:05.382 --> 01:07.284
- You think I sold out
your father.

01:07.318 --> 01:09.120
- Who else could have known
where he was?

01:09.153 --> 01:11.455
- Maybe the one
who took the picture.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.290
Rodrigo.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.526
- Was my father
really an animal?

01:15.559 --> 01:17.862
- We didn't start out
that way.

01:17.895 --> 01:19.596
- Pop.

01:20.765 --> 01:24.168
- * It's too late

01:24.201 --> 01:27.839
* For tears

01:27.872 --> 01:31.475
* Honey, it's too late

01:31.508 --> 01:35.046
* Too late to cry

01:35.079 --> 01:38.682
* Oh, but it's too late

01:38.716 --> 01:42.086
* Oh, for begging me, baby

01:42.119 --> 01:45.156
* Honey, it's too late,
too late *

01:45.189 --> 01:46.657
- I'm gonna take off
a semester...

01:46.690 --> 01:49.226
- * To cry

01:49.260 --> 01:51.328
*

01:51.362 --> 01:54.932
- Help Pop get back
on his feet.

01:54.966 --> 01:56.768
- Felipe will never
let you do that.

01:58.569 --> 02:00.171
- He needs someone.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.705
- He's got Angel.

02:01.739 --> 02:04.108
- I'm here.

02:05.442 --> 02:07.344
He's not a little baby.
We'll figure it out.

02:07.378 --> 02:10.114
*

02:10.147 --> 02:11.615
- All I had to do

02:11.648 --> 02:13.851
was look back
to see the license plate.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.553
You can't keep--
- I should've known.

02:21.492 --> 02:24.295
- * Oh, for loving me, baby

02:24.328 --> 02:26.463
*

02:26.497 --> 02:29.633
- It doesn't mean
they would've caught the guy.

02:29.666 --> 02:31.936
It would've changed nothing.

02:31.969 --> 02:34.605
*

02:34.638 --> 02:37.041
You can't blame yourself.
You--

02:46.517 --> 02:53.424
*

03:07.604 --> 03:14.478
*

03:21.785 --> 03:28.625
*

03:34.832 --> 03:41.705
*

04:27.418 --> 04:30.521
- That tunnel is older
than I am.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.523
My grandfather helped dig it.

04:32.556 --> 04:33.991
We get family in from Mexico.

04:36.293 --> 04:38.930
- Nah, she just uses it
to help her girls.

04:38.963 --> 04:40.264
None of them have papers.

04:40.297 --> 04:42.733
That's what I was doing
tonight.

04:42.766 --> 04:46.870
Ella hadn't seen
her baby in...weeks.

04:46.904 --> 04:50.007
- You should have told us
about it.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.409
- But it's not
a conflict, brother.

04:52.443 --> 04:54.245
I'm not earning
a penny off of it.

04:55.146 --> 04:58.115
- It's an illegal
fucking tunnel.

04:58.149 --> 04:59.716
- If anyone else
fell into that hole...

04:59.750 --> 05:01.518
- We could have got
a lot of people digging.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.455
Literally--into the club,
our shit with Galindo.

05:04.488 --> 05:06.958
You fucked up.

05:06.991 --> 05:10.127
- So...

05:10.161 --> 05:12.096
what happens now?

05:12.129 --> 05:13.797
- Club decision.

05:23.607 --> 05:30.481
*

05:35.686 --> 05:41.425
*

05:41.458 --> 05:43.127
- This must be overwhelming.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.665
How old is he?

05:48.699 --> 05:51.335
- He's ten months.
- He's beautiful.

05:51.368 --> 05:54.871
Mine are all grown.
Enjoy this time.

05:56.807 --> 05:57.941
Kidnapping, jeez.

05:57.975 --> 06:00.144
To have him taken from you,

06:00.177 --> 06:02.679
that must have been awful,
brutal.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.651
- Yes, it was.

06:07.684 --> 06:09.620
- You're under arrest,
Mrs. Galindo.

06:09.653 --> 06:11.588
Failure to report
a child abduction.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.525
- Take the baby.

06:14.558 --> 06:15.759
Cuff her.
- Hey, stop.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.495
Cristobal!

06:18.529 --> 06:21.098
You fucking culera.
- Guilty.

06:27.704 --> 06:34.578
*

06:35.579 --> 06:38.482
- * Mother of exiles

06:38.515 --> 06:40.684
* The torch of hope

06:40.717 --> 06:43.454
* In the toss of the tempest

06:43.487 --> 06:46.223
* Threw us medicine's rope

06:46.257 --> 06:49.660
* But the brazen giant

06:49.693 --> 06:51.562
* With limbs astride

06:51.595 --> 06:54.531
* Blocks the golden door

06:54.565 --> 06:56.367
* To the US of lies

06:56.400 --> 06:58.535
* Screaming

06:58.569 --> 07:02.906
* Damn your huddled masses

07:02.939 --> 07:05.642
* Scrub our floors

07:05.676 --> 07:08.145
* Cut our grasses

07:08.179 --> 07:10.714
* I am a wolf

07:10.747 --> 07:13.584
* A wild cur

07:13.617 --> 07:16.887
* Cut from the pack

07:16.920 --> 07:19.423
* With blood on my fur

07:19.456 --> 07:22.193
* Every howl

07:22.226 --> 07:24.861
* Marks the dead

07:24.895 --> 07:28.432
* 'Cause a beaten dog

07:28.465 --> 07:30.067
*

07:30.101 --> 07:32.103
* Never forgets

07:32.136 --> 07:35.439
*

07:35.472 --> 07:37.674
* Never forgets

07:37.708 --> 07:44.581
*

08:10.974 --> 08:12.443
- Sí.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.931
Pedro Espina.

09:36.193 --> 09:38.094
- Ignacio...

10:33.216 --> 10:37.220
*

10:39.155 --> 10:43.627
*

10:57.641 --> 10:59.543
- Sorry.
I tried not to wake you.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.912
- I-I can't fall asleep.

11:01.945 --> 11:04.080
I have to talk to my dad.
He won't pick up.

11:05.282 --> 11:07.284
- I'm sure he'll be back soon.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.185
- You have to take me
to Celia's.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.789
- That's not my business.

11:14.425 --> 11:15.792
- I lied to him.

11:17.661 --> 11:20.931
Celia didn't hurt me.

11:20.964 --> 11:22.933
I did this to myself.

11:24.835 --> 11:27.404
- Jesus.

11:27.438 --> 11:28.839
- I don't know why.
Get even, I guess.

11:28.872 --> 11:30.741
But--but if he does anything
to her, then--

11:30.774 --> 11:32.476
- Of course he's gonna
do something.

11:32.509 --> 11:34.945
What the fuck did you think
was gonna happen?

11:57.334 --> 12:00.236
- Give me your mom's address.
I'll go check on them.

12:09.713 --> 12:10.881
- Thank you.

12:16.019 --> 12:17.654
- Stay here.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.730
- Mm.

12:59.763 --> 13:01.765
No, that was the one.

13:08.104 --> 13:10.674
So much more comfortable,
don't you think?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.710
Inspires honest discourse.

13:13.744 --> 13:16.947
- I requested my lawyer.

13:16.980 --> 13:19.182
- Did you have a lawyer
at the border?

13:19.215 --> 13:21.485
Calexico East?

13:23.053 --> 13:26.222
- I was detained.
It was a mistake.

13:26.256 --> 13:27.458
They let me go.

13:27.491 --> 13:29.192
- Ah, I guess, uh,

13:29.225 --> 13:33.597
unfortunate events like that
are quite frequent lately.

13:33.630 --> 13:37.901
On behalf of my Uncle Sam,
I apologize, sir.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.303
- My lawyer.

13:40.336 --> 13:42.706
- The request
is being processed.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.441
- Well,

13:44.475 --> 13:46.543
until that process yields,
Counsel,

13:46.577 --> 13:49.279
I'm afraid all I can do
is sit here,

13:49.312 --> 13:53.316
enjoying the, uh...comfort.

13:53.349 --> 13:55.752
- You don't mind if I speak,
do you?

13:55.786 --> 13:58.589
I'm a bit of a Chatty Cathy.

13:58.622 --> 14:01.592
Did you have that doll
in Mexico?

14:01.625 --> 14:02.926
You're probably too young.

14:02.959 --> 14:06.563
Oh--not that you played
with dolls.

14:06.597 --> 14:10.767
I didn't mean that,
but it's okay if you did.

14:10.801 --> 14:12.703
I embrace the rainbow.

14:16.473 --> 14:18.274
Hmm.

14:18.308 --> 14:22.278
An Ivy League-educated
cartel boss.

14:22.312 --> 14:24.648
If that's not a sign
of a brave new world,

14:24.681 --> 14:27.317
I don't know what is.

14:27.350 --> 14:29.352
Hmm.

14:29.385 --> 14:32.789
Dual citizenship,
permanent residency in the US,

14:32.823 --> 14:35.158
20-acre estate,
paid for in cash.

14:41.832 --> 14:43.967
Manufacturing interests,
trucking,

14:44.000 --> 14:45.602
commercial real estate.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.804
Very impressive, señor.

14:48.905 --> 14:50.874
No wonder your mayor
and local law enforcement

14:50.907 --> 14:52.709
turned a blind eye.

15:15.365 --> 15:16.833
I have to be honest with you.

15:16.867 --> 15:20.236
We didn't contact your lawyer.

15:20.270 --> 15:24.207
Under Homeland Security laws,
I don't have to.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.877
I can keep you
for as long as I want to.

15:28.612 --> 15:29.780
Your wife too.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.487
*

15:37.520 --> 15:38.955
- Miguel!

15:42.759 --> 15:44.494
- Failure to report
a kidnapping

15:44.527 --> 15:46.863
is a federal crime.

15:46.897 --> 15:53.770
*

16:10.153 --> 16:13.123
- Hey, Boy Scout.
- Hey, man. Letty's--

16:19.329 --> 16:21.397
Oh, man.

16:21.431 --> 16:23.533
She's dead.

16:23.566 --> 16:24.901
- I know.

16:24.935 --> 16:26.937
I fucking killed her.

16:28.972 --> 16:30.573
Relax.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.943
Shit.

17:06.977 --> 17:09.512
Sorry, this--this must
be bringing back

17:09.545 --> 17:11.948
all kinds of crazy memories.

17:11.982 --> 17:14.384
Your mom.

17:16.186 --> 17:18.021
- I guess.

17:18.054 --> 17:20.323
- What the fuck
that's like, man?

17:20.356 --> 17:22.325
Remembering everything?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.896
- You learn to shut it down.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.902
- Guess you gots to.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.607
Can't change yesterday.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.676
Can't plan tomorrow.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.011
I might walk out
of this building,

17:41.044 --> 17:43.379
take a bullet
to the head.

17:43.413 --> 17:46.783
Life is here. This.

17:46.817 --> 17:50.153
No matter what it looks like,
it's all we got, right?

17:50.186 --> 17:52.522
No regrets.

17:54.691 --> 17:56.359
- Especially that.

17:59.095 --> 18:02.799
I didn't murder a whore.

18:02.833 --> 18:05.001
Freed my mother.

18:05.035 --> 18:07.303
Gave her some peace.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.105
Took away the noise.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.142
- That's one way to look at it.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.311
- It's the only way, Ezekiel.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.680
If I see this as a fuckup,

18:17.714 --> 18:21.651
something horrible,

18:21.684 --> 18:23.820
I lose my truth.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.321
I gotta trust
that all this shit

18:25.355 --> 18:27.323
was supposed to happen.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.759
- So we don't ever
make mistakes?

18:28.792 --> 18:30.560
- Of course we do.

18:30.593 --> 18:34.898
Mistakes are more important
than getting it right.

18:34.931 --> 18:37.333
But they're still supposed
to happen.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.603
It all leads into
the next right thing.

18:42.973 --> 18:45.608
- I don't know, man.

18:45.641 --> 18:49.012
You--you thought you were
supposed to finish school?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.947
Get some important job?

18:50.981 --> 18:54.250
A big old house up in Marin?

18:54.284 --> 18:57.788
As fucked up as it was,
shooting that cop--

18:57.821 --> 18:59.956
that was your truth.

18:59.990 --> 19:01.892
It had to happen.

19:01.925 --> 19:04.260
It led you to this.

19:04.294 --> 19:06.362
All that other shit,

19:06.396 --> 19:08.298
it ain't real.

19:08.331 --> 19:10.867
It ain't even a memory.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.904
That's the fucking noise, man.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.309
*

19:30.420 --> 19:32.255
- Angel.

19:32.288 --> 19:33.857
- Yeah.

19:37.293 --> 19:39.762
- I'm with Coco
at his mom's.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.166
- Something like that.

19:43.199 --> 19:44.935
- Tell Coco we need him
back here.

19:44.968 --> 19:47.303
We got a Templo sit-down.

19:47.337 --> 19:48.738
- I'll let him know.

19:54.644 --> 19:56.279
- Fuck you.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.021
- They need you at the table.
- Okay.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.864
How's my kid?

20:13.897 --> 20:15.631
- Had her stay in my trailer.

20:15.665 --> 20:17.800
I went to my dad's.

20:17.834 --> 20:21.171
She's been calling you.
- Yeah, I know.

20:21.204 --> 20:23.706
Can't let her see Celia
like this, you know?

20:23.739 --> 20:26.910
I'm gonna tell her, but--
but not here.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.346
- She's supposed to stay
at the yard, but...

20:33.083 --> 20:35.351
I better stick around.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.854
- Thank you.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.190
Once it gets dark, uh,

20:40.223 --> 20:43.293
I'm gonna take her
to the desert and bury her.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.996
She fucking hated the desert.

20:46.029 --> 20:52.903
*

20:58.541 --> 21:02.212
- KJ.

21:02.245 --> 21:05.581
- Galindo got cut loose
from Calexico.

21:05.615 --> 21:08.218
Potter was afraid
it might be NSA, CIA.

21:08.251 --> 21:10.353
Didn't want to take the chance
of losing him again.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.355
Picked him up last night
at the house.

21:12.388 --> 21:15.258
- Jesus.

21:15.291 --> 21:18.328
- DOJ wants Galindo
on a string.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.864
Help spin the Mexican turmoil
in the right direction.

21:21.898 --> 21:23.866
They'll use
any leverage they got

21:23.900 --> 21:25.501
to force that deal.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.837
- EZ's intel...

21:27.870 --> 21:30.073
- Could be exposed.

21:39.115 --> 21:42.185
- Nearby. He's in good care.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.388
- I want to see my lawyer,
and I want to see my son.

21:45.421 --> 21:46.856
- You don't make demands.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.391
You're lucky
you're not in a cell.

21:48.424 --> 21:51.394
- I am not in a cell
because this is all bullshit.

21:51.427 --> 21:54.130
You didn't charge Miguel, which
means you just want something.

21:54.164 --> 21:57.000
And you think you can
use me as leverage.

21:58.468 --> 22:00.103
- Why isn't she
behind a table?

22:00.136 --> 22:02.338
- Potter likes
the informality.

22:05.675 --> 22:07.277
- Eight years ago,
you had an abortion.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.479
Was EZ Reyes the father?

22:11.147 --> 22:13.449
- It's a simple
yes or no question.

22:13.483 --> 22:15.618
- No, Agent Bowen,
it's not.

22:15.651 --> 22:17.220
It's tactless,

22:17.253 --> 22:19.122
ham-fisted.

22:19.155 --> 22:21.791
And now you've put Ms. Thomas
on the defensive,

22:21.824 --> 22:25.595
undermining...
the whole comfort strategy.

22:29.032 --> 22:30.333
Apologies.

22:34.637 --> 22:36.306
- Let's go, Bowen.

22:36.339 --> 22:37.540
- Yeah.

22:44.447 --> 22:47.417
- I assure you,
that was not some kind

22:47.450 --> 22:49.785
of good cop, bad cop routine.

22:51.154 --> 22:53.656
I genuinely dislike that man.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.028
- Just tell me what the fuck
is happening.

22:58.061 --> 22:59.295
- You're right.

22:59.329 --> 23:01.864
We have no hard evidence.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.034
There is nothing that can
actually convict you

23:04.067 --> 23:05.535
or your husband.

23:05.568 --> 23:07.337
- Oh, that seems a bit
counterintuitive

23:07.370 --> 23:10.173
for the Department of Justice.
- True.

23:10.206 --> 23:13.843
But it could be our
counterintuitive counterparts--

23:13.876 --> 23:16.612
Homeland Security,
Drug Enforcement,

23:16.646 --> 23:19.682
the Mexican government.

23:32.428 --> 23:34.397
- A future.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.501
I don't want to bring
your husband down, señora.

23:38.534 --> 23:42.605
I want to build him up,
empower him.

23:50.946 --> 23:52.848
- Shit.

23:52.882 --> 23:55.218
You just want him
in your pocket.

23:55.885 --> 23:57.720
- No.

23:57.753 --> 24:00.556
We want a partner.

24:00.590 --> 24:03.593
*

24:13.369 --> 24:15.871
- Two rooms down.
Equally comfortable.

24:15.905 --> 24:17.907
- Leave my family out of this.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.410
- It's all about your family.

24:20.443 --> 24:22.545
That's the only reason
I'm here.

24:34.424 --> 24:37.393
Seven years ago, I was
moments away from shutting down

24:37.427 --> 24:41.464
one of the largest arms dealers
on the West Coast.

24:41.497 --> 24:45.235
Culmination of a three-year
RICO investigation.

24:45.268 --> 24:49.439
The real IRA and their
leather-clad salesmen,

24:49.472 --> 24:52.808
Sons of Anarchy
Motorcycle Club.

24:52.842 --> 24:55.478
But before that could happen,
fate intervened.

24:55.511 --> 24:59.782
I was informed by powers
greater than myself

24:59.815 --> 25:02.652
that the Irish guns
must keep flowing.

25:04.154 --> 25:07.823
They were needed to ensure
that the Galindo Cartel

25:07.857 --> 25:12.428
didn't lose their grip
on the Sonora heroin trade.

25:12.462 --> 25:15.998
- My father's deal
with the CIA.

25:16.031 --> 25:18.968
- Yes.

25:19.001 --> 25:21.604
Back when relationships
with narcotrafficantes

25:21.637 --> 25:24.674
were more, uh...
synergetic.

25:25.675 --> 25:30.180
- And you want
that synergy with me?

25:32.215 --> 25:34.784
- When that RICO case
shattered, I...

25:34.817 --> 25:37.920
nearly traded in my wings.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.356
But...

25:40.390 --> 25:42.858
I needed to understand
what happened and why.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.329
I requested
a training sabbatical

25:46.362 --> 25:48.998
with the Foreign Affairs
Division in Mexico City.

25:49.031 --> 25:50.833
I immersed myself
in the culture.

25:50.866 --> 25:52.868
I learned the language.

25:52.902 --> 25:54.537
Got to know key players
in Mexico's

25:54.570 --> 25:56.839
ever-shifting
power structure.

25:58.641 --> 26:01.344
Five years later,

26:01.377 --> 26:06.282
my, uh, somewhat
obsessive nature

26:06.316 --> 26:10.520
secured me
the racist moniker...

26:15.057 --> 26:16.859
It's ironic.

26:18.394 --> 26:21.364
No, it's just sad...

26:21.397 --> 26:26.702
how--how a little bit
of knowledge

26:26.736 --> 26:31.574
can be so powerful
when surrounded by...

26:31.607 --> 26:33.042
ignorance.

26:33.075 --> 26:36.379
- Yeah, I don't give a shit.

26:36.412 --> 26:39.014
Just tell me what you want.

26:39.048 --> 26:41.351
- The thing we all want:

26:41.384 --> 26:44.320
peace of mind,
stability.

26:44.354 --> 26:48.023
Yesterday afternoon,
Los Olvidados pulled off

26:48.057 --> 26:51.727
another coordinated attack
on your heroin facility.

26:51.761 --> 26:54.497
They are
an ever-increasing threat

26:54.530 --> 26:58.334
to your control of both Sonora
and the East Cali border.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.869
Growing stronger every day.

26:59.902 --> 27:02.037
Inspiring
a dangerous resurgence

27:02.071 --> 27:04.240
of Neozapatism.

27:07.643 --> 27:10.746
These terrorists, they, uh--

27:10.780 --> 27:13.148
they live and die
by their own rules.

27:14.450 --> 27:18.954
There is never a compromise
to put on the table.

27:18.988 --> 27:21.857
- Oh, I've seen
those compromises.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.859
The CIA crushed my father.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.596
That deal threatened
everything--

27:26.629 --> 27:28.964
his business,
his friendships.

27:28.998 --> 27:30.800
It put him
in an early grave.

27:30.833 --> 27:34.069
- Ah, but you

27:34.103 --> 27:35.905
can change all that.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.476
Turn blood
into imported wine.

27:48.851 --> 27:50.353
Fuck you.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.590
Charge me or release me.

27:57.159 --> 28:00.696
- So much for comfort
and cordiality.

28:10.706 --> 28:13.275
Oof.

28:24.053 --> 28:28.491
- * And listen
to the falling rain *

28:28.524 --> 28:31.193
* I feel so lonely

28:31.226 --> 28:35.531
* But the thunder
will ease my pain *

28:35.565 --> 28:38.601
*

28:38.634 --> 28:42.705
* As I stand there
and listen *

28:42.738 --> 28:44.807
*

28:51.381 --> 28:55.017
- * And everything is grand

28:55.050 --> 28:59.622
*

28:59.655 --> 29:04.326
* Fair weather blues,
stay away from me *

29:07.363 --> 29:14.236
*

29:41.296 --> 29:48.203
*

29:51.106 --> 29:53.643
- Hey.

29:58.047 --> 30:04.386
*

30:07.423 --> 30:14.296
*

30:21.637 --> 30:23.606
- Shit.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.443
- Be right there.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.445
- Coco!

30:29.479 --> 30:32.782
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

30:32.815 --> 30:35.217
- Sorry, I was taking a shit.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.652
- Ew.

30:36.686 --> 30:38.754
- Coco wants you back
at the yard.

30:38.788 --> 30:42.291
- I thought he was here.
Why does he want me back there?

30:42.324 --> 30:44.126
- I don't ask questions.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.997
- I didn't get a chance.

30:48.030 --> 30:49.765
How'd you get here?

30:54.604 --> 30:56.839
You two been spending
a lot of time together.

30:56.872 --> 30:59.008
- Again, ew.

30:59.041 --> 31:00.943
- Take her back
to the scrap yard, Chucky.

31:00.976 --> 31:03.979
- Return trip. Gets no lip.

31:04.013 --> 31:07.249
- Oh, great.
Now we're rhyming.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.384
- I'll be right behind you.

31:19.028 --> 31:21.130
Oh.

31:21.163 --> 31:22.498
My bad.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.540
Sí.

31:35.044 --> 31:36.145
- Ah.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.670
- I'm guessing
things aren't going so well

32:00.703 --> 32:02.872
in the other room.

32:02.905 --> 32:05.741
You all seem
a little restless.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.686
- Please stop doing that.

32:16.719 --> 32:18.120
- I'm sorry.

32:19.221 --> 32:20.923
Spectrum stuff.

32:20.956 --> 32:24.059
I'm just, uh--
just trying to understand

32:24.093 --> 32:27.262
how you ended up here,
Ms. Thomas.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.334
- The bitch bringing me tea
set me up.

32:34.904 --> 32:37.539
In the bigger picture,
Mrs. Galindo.

32:39.642 --> 32:41.877
I have no doubt
that what happened

32:41.911 --> 32:45.214
with you and Ezekiel Reyes
was--

32:45.247 --> 32:47.349
was devastating.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.719
But you were young,

32:49.752 --> 32:52.922
resilient, so smart.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.760
Was it just a cosmic "fuck you"
to the silly pale people

32:57.793 --> 33:01.363
being crushed by
their own mundanity?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.733
I understand that.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.467
I really do.

33:07.102 --> 33:11.874
Needing something...
bigger, bolder,

33:11.907 --> 33:14.777
more dangerous.

33:14.810 --> 33:17.613
- Or...
I fell in love.

33:17.647 --> 33:20.449
- Yes. Amor...

33:22.017 --> 33:25.755
The uninvited guest
to destiny's party.

33:27.089 --> 33:29.992
So simple...

33:30.025 --> 33:34.463
yet so...powerful.

33:34.496 --> 33:36.832
- You're...

33:36.866 --> 33:40.302
very entertaining,
Mr. Potter.

33:40.335 --> 33:45.107
And I'm sure, beneath that...
mask of eccentricity,

33:45.140 --> 33:47.609
you're just as scared
as the rest of us.

33:49.845 --> 33:51.981
But...

33:52.014 --> 33:55.484
no matter what loss
you threaten me with

33:55.517 --> 33:59.822
or what gift
you promise to deliver...

34:02.357 --> 34:04.694
I won't turn on my husband.

34:06.228 --> 34:08.197
And if you really did
your research,

34:08.230 --> 34:09.799
you would already know that.

34:18.674 --> 34:21.443
- Just make sure that we are
all on the same team here.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.278
We have to protect the process.

34:25.915 --> 34:28.517
- We picked up Galindo
because of your intel.

34:28.550 --> 34:30.986
- Right after you told me
our deal was still in play,

34:31.020 --> 34:34.323
after you promised me that
my men wouldn't be compromised!

34:36.191 --> 34:39.128
You feed him
to the tigers yet?

34:39.161 --> 34:41.931
- KJ, don't do this.

34:45.267 --> 34:49.304
- So if we don't punish
drug traffickers, Mr. Potter.

34:49.338 --> 34:50.339
what is it we do?

34:50.372 --> 34:51.741
What's the badge for?

34:51.774 --> 34:53.175
We risk our lives,

34:53.208 --> 34:55.477
ruin our marriages,
our health,

34:55.510 --> 34:57.747
for what?
- Let's go.

34:59.548 --> 35:01.416
I'm leaving,

35:01.450 --> 35:03.685
but I got plenty more
intel, so...

35:03.719 --> 35:05.354
maybe you can wait
a few days,

35:05.387 --> 35:06.922
read about it
on WikiLeaks

35:06.956 --> 35:10.059
or maybe in
"The Washington Post."

35:10.092 --> 35:12.427
I'm gonna blow this shit up.

35:14.797 --> 35:16.531
- This is very unsettling

35:16.565 --> 35:18.200
and dangerous.

35:18.233 --> 35:21.536
- He's my problem,
and I'll handle it.

35:21.570 --> 35:24.573
- Your problem
has become my problem,

35:24.606 --> 35:28.110
so now...I handle it.

36:06.415 --> 36:08.250
- Hey, Pop.

36:10.285 --> 36:11.787
- Just heading back.

36:11.821 --> 36:12.788
- Don't.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.389
What's going on?

36:14.423 --> 36:15.424
- Not over the phone.

36:15.457 --> 36:17.192
Get to the house.

36:24.967 --> 36:29.338
- Keeping this from the club...
it erodes trust.

36:29.371 --> 36:33.475
And inside
this current crucible,

36:33.508 --> 36:35.777
that's very dangerous.

36:42.684 --> 36:46.121
- I didn't think I was...
hiding anything.

36:47.456 --> 36:50.893
But...I get it.

36:53.062 --> 36:55.164
- Here's what's on the table.

36:55.197 --> 36:57.366
We let Riz stay a full patch,

36:57.399 --> 36:59.434
all privileges,

36:59.468 --> 37:00.970
but he loses his office.

37:03.005 --> 37:05.841
We vote in a new secretary.

37:05.875 --> 37:09.511
And the club takes 10% of all
that revenue from that tunnel.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.616
That includes Vicki's whores.
- That's...not my money.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.718
- Then we shut it down...

37:16.751 --> 37:18.187
and it's no one's money.

37:24.193 --> 37:31.066
*

37:38.874 --> 37:40.042
- All in favor.

37:40.075 --> 37:46.949
*

37:51.220 --> 37:57.526
*

38:01.563 --> 38:02.998
- To protect you.

38:03.032 --> 38:04.699
Bishop thought you were
the fucking mole,

38:04.733 --> 38:06.401
that your covert family shit
was about the rebels.

38:06.435 --> 38:07.937
- I told them what it was.

38:07.970 --> 38:09.171
- After I fucking saved
your ass!

38:09.204 --> 38:10.172
- You didn't do it
to save my ass.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.340
You did it to save your own.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.774
And heat on me
means heat on you.

38:12.807 --> 38:13.842
- You don't take it
to us first?

38:13.875 --> 38:15.244
- I didn't have time!

38:15.277 --> 38:16.445
I tried to fucking tell you.

38:16.478 --> 38:17.612
I just thought that you--

38:17.646 --> 38:19.414
- You don't think.
You never do.

38:19.448 --> 38:21.050
Your dance with Adelita--
your dick's gonna get us

38:21.083 --> 38:23.385
into a shallow fucking grave.

38:23.418 --> 38:25.187
- Hey!

38:25.220 --> 38:27.222
Hey, Angel!

38:29.824 --> 38:31.460
Coming to me first--

38:31.493 --> 38:33.862
that would've been
the respectful play.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.797
But you had to be a bitch.

38:35.830 --> 38:39.134
Tell Daddy, huh?
- It wasn't just Angel.

38:39.168 --> 38:40.769
It was all of us.

38:42.004 --> 38:43.772
- We all took it to Bishop.

38:53.082 --> 38:55.484
You're all just a bunch
of fucking pussies.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.888
- You know you're gonna have

38:59.921 --> 39:01.156
to kick the shit
out of him, right?

39:01.190 --> 39:02.591
- Yup.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.196
- I'll catch up.

39:10.966 --> 39:12.834
- Yeah, here you go.

39:16.438 --> 39:20.275
- How do we know that guy isn't
some kind of serial killer?

39:20.309 --> 39:23.778
- Apparently,
only a chronic masturbator.

39:23.812 --> 39:25.780
- I didn't need to know that.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.119
- The things I gave you
on Galindo...

39:30.152 --> 39:31.653
they were true
but hardly enough--

39:31.686 --> 39:33.522
- It's not about
building a case.

39:33.555 --> 39:35.424
He'll use it as leverage.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.192
Show Galindo enough
to make him realize

39:37.226 --> 39:39.628
he's been under
a microscope.

39:39.661 --> 39:40.795
Get him scared.

39:40.829 --> 39:43.365
- And this US attorney,

39:43.398 --> 39:45.334
he'd give the cartel
a name.

39:45.367 --> 39:47.302
- He wouldn't have to.

39:47.336 --> 39:50.705
If my deal's gone,
I'll be back inside.

39:50.739 --> 39:52.774
DOJ won't give a shit
about protecting me.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.376
- Neither will the DEA.

39:54.409 --> 39:56.845
You'll be dead before
you're assigned a cell.

39:56.878 --> 39:59.214
- Jesus Christ.

39:59.248 --> 40:01.216
- I never thought I'd say this.

40:01.250 --> 40:02.651
But you need to run, primo.

40:02.684 --> 40:04.853
Get whatever you got and go.

40:04.886 --> 40:06.821
I can get you some IDs,
a decent passport.

40:10.759 --> 40:11.926
- I'm not running.

40:13.595 --> 40:15.164
If they found out it's me,

40:15.197 --> 40:17.099
Angel brought me in.

40:18.267 --> 40:20.669
The M.C. will think
he's a part of it.

40:22.037 --> 40:23.638
They'll kill him too.

40:59.308 --> 41:00.775
- Most of it
is the ramblings

41:00.809 --> 41:02.844
of a beautiful mind.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.215
You should, uh, just look
at the highlighted entries.

41:17.226 --> 41:18.927
- Who gave you
this information?

41:21.296 --> 41:23.665
- Someone we know and love.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.702
Highlights.
If they're corroborated,

41:27.736 --> 41:28.770
could lead to charges.

41:28.803 --> 41:30.105
I just...

41:30.139 --> 41:32.241
need a simple
acknowledgement

41:32.274 --> 41:35.076
of your husband's participation
in the crime

41:35.110 --> 41:36.245
or maybe something similar.

41:36.278 --> 41:37.579
Don't need a lot of detail,

41:37.612 --> 41:41.116
just date and location.

42:07.876 --> 42:09.278
What is this?

42:09.311 --> 42:10.812
- I apologize
for the current state

42:10.845 --> 42:12.914
of family services.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.350
Budget cuts--awful.

42:16.385 --> 42:18.187
This is the bullshit
kidnapping charge

42:18.220 --> 42:19.921
that will get thrown out
in court.

42:19.954 --> 42:23.592
But just filing it allows us
to take away your son.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.960
And with
the backlog of cases...

42:32.667 --> 42:35.136
- You can't fucking do this.

42:35.170 --> 42:36.838
- Yes, I can.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.542
See?

42:40.575 --> 42:42.811
No more mask of eccentricity.

42:42.844 --> 42:45.814
Just raw legal power.

42:49.684 --> 42:53.522
A kidnapping case that
dovetails into a border issue?

42:54.756 --> 42:57.859
Unraveling that
in this reality show?

43:02.431 --> 43:06.535
Your son will be with us until
the clown leaves the party.

43:09.338 --> 43:10.539
- You can't do this--

43:10.572 --> 43:12.374
- First draft.
- All I'll need.

43:12.407 --> 43:14.643
- Home screen.
Hit comfort zone two.

43:14.676 --> 43:16.110
- Gracias.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.085
Here's the deal.

43:24.118 --> 43:27.322
So many pages, I apologize.
Legal ribbons and bows.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.891
The meat of it:

43:29.924 --> 43:31.092
we promise
to keep you instated

43:31.125 --> 43:33.495
as reigning heroin king.

43:33.528 --> 43:37.899
You own Sonora
and the East Cali border.

43:37.932 --> 43:40.269
We'll also supply manpower
and weapons

43:40.302 --> 43:42.771
to crush Los Olvidados

43:42.804 --> 43:46.107
and any, uh, cartel threats
that might pop up.

43:46.140 --> 43:51.212
We'll also get rid of any
EPA snags slowing down your

43:51.246 --> 43:54.549
Santo Padre Agra-Park project.

43:57.452 --> 44:00.289
For us, we, uh...

44:00.322 --> 44:02.190
We reinstate balance

44:02.223 --> 44:05.394
and, uh,
protect our interests.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.364
Occasionally we might
need your product.

44:09.398 --> 44:11.900
Tends to be a valuable currency
in certain markets.

44:11.933 --> 44:16.538
And, uh...
sometimes we'll need

44:16.571 --> 44:19.107
information
on certain associates.

44:20.775 --> 44:24.813
Other "most interesting men
in the world," like yourself.

44:24.846 --> 44:27.649
But nothing to crush you or...

44:27.682 --> 44:30.184
undermine your ascent
to sainthood.

44:31.019 --> 44:34.623
I know.
"Charge me or release me."

44:44.866 --> 44:47.736
- King Solomon.

44:47.769 --> 44:50.204
An ancient move
but an effective one.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.242
The, uh--the folder
she's looking at

44:54.275 --> 44:55.410
is a kidnapping charge.

44:55.444 --> 44:57.278
It won't hold up in court,

44:57.312 --> 45:00.382
but it will be enough
to keep your son in our care.

45:02.484 --> 45:04.986
- You can't just take my kid.
- Wake up, little Mikey!

45:05.019 --> 45:07.121
Wake the fuck up!

45:09.190 --> 45:11.693
You're living in Papi's world.

45:15.964 --> 45:18.933
The other folder
is dirt on you--

45:18.967 --> 45:21.135
random shit,
but with her testimony,

45:21.169 --> 45:23.405
it's enough to put you in jail.

45:26.074 --> 45:29.544
So...

45:29.578 --> 45:33.748
your lovely albino bride
has a choice to make.

45:34.983 --> 45:38.787
Her man or...

45:38.820 --> 45:40.355
her child.

45:40.389 --> 45:42.591
- You can't make her do that.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.696
- You have five minutes
to thumb through it.

45:47.729 --> 45:50.532
If it's not signed
by the time I get back,

45:50.565 --> 45:52.867
you make her decide your fate.

45:52.901 --> 45:57.672
- Oh, so is this part
of your brave new world?

45:59.441 --> 46:02.677
You really think
this changes anything?

46:03.678 --> 46:06.548
- That's the point, Miguel.

46:11.052 --> 46:13.588
We don't like change.

46:13.622 --> 46:15.356
We never have.

46:31.205 --> 46:38.079
*

46:55.063 --> 46:59.801
*

47:06.608 --> 47:13.482
*

47:22.323 --> 47:29.197
*

47:54.956 --> 48:01.830
*

48:26.420 --> 48:30.058
You can see your lawyer now.

48:47.075 --> 48:49.310
- Bike is losing torque...

48:49.343 --> 48:51.045
just like the fucking rider.

48:55.216 --> 48:57.385
Talked to Devante
a few miles back.

48:57.418 --> 49:00.855
That shit with Galindo,
it's getting more complicated.

49:00.889 --> 49:02.390
Gonna need a full table.

49:02.423 --> 49:05.393
- Yeah. We're all here.

49:09.063 --> 49:10.765
- Hey, Taza.

49:16.470 --> 49:20.408
- US Attorneys Office,
DEA, Mexican feds--

49:20.441 --> 49:23.011
full fucking parade, man.

49:23.044 --> 49:25.614
- At that level,

49:25.647 --> 49:27.916
you don't need charges.

49:27.949 --> 49:30.518
- Devante just got done
talking to the wife.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.053
They rattled her.

49:32.086 --> 49:33.955
She told them some
very disturbing shit.

49:51.505 --> 49:53.107
- I don't know.

49:53.141 --> 49:54.943
She was talking to Coco
for a while.

49:54.976 --> 49:56.711
Then El Padrino showed up.

49:56.745 --> 49:59.147
They're all in the Templo now.

49:59.180 --> 50:00.649
It's tense.

50:17.498 --> 50:20.468
[man rapping in Spanish
on radio]

50:20.501 --> 50:25.106
*

50:26.808 --> 50:33.682
*

50:40.822 --> 50:42.456
I'll make sure we do it right.

50:44.325 --> 50:46.260
- Needs to be
on neutral ground.

50:46.294 --> 50:48.162
Maybe the casino.

50:48.196 --> 50:50.364
Private room.

50:58.673 --> 50:59.874
- Not sure.

51:01.409 --> 51:02.977
- I'll find him.

51:05.179 --> 51:07.481
*

51:16.725 --> 51:18.659
- Prospect.

51:18.693 --> 51:25.533
*

51:25.566 --> 51:27.568
Relax, Einstein.

51:29.103 --> 51:32.841
Padrino's Road King,
spitting oil.

51:32.874 --> 51:34.876
Needs a new base gasket.

51:44.052 --> 51:45.920
- Yeah.

51:47.722 --> 51:50.424
- Okay. I'll do it right now.

51:50.458 --> 51:53.261
- Or tomorrow.

51:53.294 --> 51:55.196
I can do it tomorrow.

51:55.229 --> 51:57.398
Put it on the lift.

51:57.431 --> 51:58.733
I can do that now.

52:02.904 --> 52:04.372
Okay.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.879
- He's walking that fine line
between genius

52:10.912 --> 52:12.346
and just fucking weird.

52:14.215 --> 52:20.121
*

52:26.828 --> 52:28.196
- He's fine.

52:28.229 --> 52:31.199
He doesn't know anything.

52:31.232 --> 52:33.768
It's all good...for now.

52:33.802 --> 52:35.203
- Okay.

52:35.236 --> 52:37.605
- Don't worry, Pop.

52:37.638 --> 52:39.974
- I'm here
if you need anything.

52:40.008 --> 52:41.509
- I know.

52:42.911 --> 52:44.312
Good night.

52:52.620 --> 52:53.955
- No.

52:55.489 --> 52:59.060
Angel told him
that Galindo was cut loose.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.862
Feds let him go.

53:02.496 --> 53:04.498
- Our boy got lucky.

53:04.532 --> 53:07.768
- That mean the DEA deal
is still in play?

53:07.802 --> 53:10.939
- If it is, I won't be
his handler.

53:10.972 --> 53:14.408
After today...

53:14.442 --> 53:15.810
I'm done.

53:15.844 --> 53:18.779
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

53:20.949 --> 53:22.150
Guess I'm gonna have
to find another way

53:22.183 --> 53:24.785
to work on my daddy shit.

53:26.821 --> 53:28.656
Take care of yourself, Felipe.

53:30.024 --> 53:32.026
- You too, son.

53:57.551 --> 54:00.388
*

54:00.421 --> 54:01.856
- Come on, Angel!

54:01.890 --> 54:08.296
*

54:12.500 --> 54:14.302
- Get off the fence!

54:14.335 --> 54:20.909
*

54:26.047 --> 54:28.649
- Get up!

54:28.682 --> 54:29.918
- Come on!

54:29.951 --> 54:32.086
- Get up!
- Get up!

54:43.297 --> 54:44.465
- Get up! Get up! Get up!

54:47.902 --> 54:49.803
- All right, that's enough.
End it.

54:54.542 --> 54:56.410
- Way to go, boys.

54:59.613 --> 55:01.349
We good?

55:03.952 --> 55:06.387
- Yeah.

55:08.489 --> 55:10.791
- Yo, I got a cut, homey.

55:17.431 --> 55:19.968
- I'm so sorry, my love.
- There is no sorry.

55:20.001 --> 55:22.536
We're in this together.
Fuck these assholes.

55:22.570 --> 55:24.238
- You talk to Devante
and the lawyers?

55:24.272 --> 55:25.406
- There wasn't much to say.

55:25.439 --> 55:26.640
Everything Potter threw at me

55:26.674 --> 55:29.543
was just "Beautiful Mind"
bullshit.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.282
None of the intel was real.

55:34.315 --> 55:36.717
- 'Cause they have nothing.
- Yeah.

55:36.750 --> 55:37.785
But now they do.

55:41.855 --> 55:43.124
- Look, I won't
let them do to me

55:43.157 --> 55:44.125
what they did to my father.

55:44.158 --> 55:45.726
- They own us, Miguel.

55:45.759 --> 55:49.397
They can touch everything
we have, everyone we know.

55:49.430 --> 55:50.999
- Not everyone.

55:52.300 --> 55:55.970
Look, these ignorant
fucking puppeteers

55:56.004 --> 55:58.606
are gonna find out what
it feels like to be played.

56:00.041 --> 56:01.609
I've got 2,000
forgotten soldiers

56:01.642 --> 56:04.312
just waiting for a devil
to lead them.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.555
- Vámonos.
- Vamos.

56:18.392 --> 56:21.429
- Feliz viaje.

56:50.524 --> 56:52.060
Hmm.

56:58.066 --> 56:59.033
- You look good
in that cage, man,

56:59.067 --> 57:00.301
you know, like a ugly,

57:00.334 --> 57:02.336
skinny, uh, Conor McGregor.

57:02.370 --> 57:04.338
- You're so fucking kind.

57:04.372 --> 57:05.839
Thank you.

57:05.873 --> 57:08.842
- What you think this
Galindo sit

57:08.876 --> 57:11.812
- If we're doing it
on neutral turf,

57:11.845 --> 57:13.847
he has a third party.

57:13.881 --> 57:15.683
He wants to make them
feel safe.

57:15.716 --> 57:18.652
- I don't know.

57:18.686 --> 57:21.189
But whatever it is, I gotta
give Adelita a heads-up.

57:21.222 --> 57:23.657
- You mind giving Celia
a ride?

57:23.691 --> 57:26.160
- Nah, we gotta head out
to the desert anyhow.

57:26.194 --> 57:27.828
- And I know who's
digging the hole.

57:27.861 --> 57:30.231
- I think you should
make it heart-shaped.

57:30.264 --> 57:31.932
- Nah.

57:31.965 --> 57:34.168
You should make it look
like a--like a big dick.

57:35.569 --> 57:37.371
- It'd be a nice change.

57:37.405 --> 57:40.074
You know,
her being inside one

57:40.108 --> 57:41.909
instead of one inside her.

57:41.942 --> 57:43.744
- Damn, bro.

57:43.777 --> 57:46.614
Too soon?

57:46.647 --> 57:49.350
- Go be with your kid.
Don't let her fuck Chucky.

57:49.383 --> 57:50.918
- Hey!

58:29.089 --> 58:30.291
- Sí.

58:40.168 --> 58:43.070
- Aw, man, that's nasty.

58:43.103 --> 58:44.805
- And you know the only thing
oozing out this bitch

58:44.838 --> 58:46.574
is come and wine coolers.

58:46.607 --> 58:48.342
- That doesn't help.

59:04.024 --> 59:05.359
Shit!

59:05.393 --> 59:07.261
- Oh!

59:10.063 --> 59:12.200
- Damn!

59:12.233 --> 59:13.501
- Fucking rat.

59:57.611 --> 1:00:00.714
Shit.
Who is it?

1:00:02.516 --> 1:00:03.984
- Local.

1:00:14.262 --> 1:00:17.231
It's Franky.

1:00:26.374 --> 1:00:28.108
- You guys got a taillight out.

1:00:28.141 --> 1:00:30.177
- Didn't know.

1:00:32.613 --> 1:00:35.182
- Something like that.

1:00:37.084 --> 1:00:38.786
- The same thing
that's gonna happen to you

1:00:38.819 --> 1:00:40.721
if you don't get that
fucking light out of my eyes.

1:00:40.754 --> 1:00:42.390
- Hey.

1:00:42.423 --> 1:00:46.294
I know these guys.
- Well, I don't.

1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:54.735
Step out of the car.

1:00:54.768 --> 1:00:55.969
Both of you.

1:00:57.438 --> 1:00:58.772
And very committed.

1:00:58.806 --> 1:01:00.274
Just walk through it.

1:01:08.682 --> 1:01:10.318
- Knees.

1:01:11.952 --> 1:01:13.821
- Educate your rookie,
Officer Rogan.

1:01:13.854 --> 1:01:15.756
- I got them.
You start on the car.

1:01:15.789 --> 1:01:17.291
- Don't need
to do that, Franky.

1:01:17.325 --> 1:01:18.759
- Man, it's just
a broken taillight.

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:21.295
Let them up.

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:22.996
- Then you cuff 'em.

1:01:33.874 --> 1:01:37.010
- Once we're off the dash cam,
I'll bring him up to speed.

1:01:38.479 --> 1:01:40.981
- Holy shit.

1:01:55.996 --> 1:02:02.336

1:02:02.370 --> 1:02:04.338
- Dispatch, this is Dugman.

1:02:04.372 --> 1:02:08.942
We got a 927 David with
two male Hispanic suspects...
