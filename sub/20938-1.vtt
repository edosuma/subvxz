WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.100
Baikonur.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.420
Baikonur, over.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.220
Do you copy?

00:15.740 --> 00:17.380
Soyuz, we copy.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.700
Pressure in the TDU: 320 atmospheres.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.220
Pressure in the orientation
system unreadable.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.980
I repeat: unreadable.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.260
You will have to correct manually.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.900
Manual correction already done.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.420
The ship is oriented towards azimuth 155.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.460
Ready for re-entry.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.740
Roger, Soyuz!

00:35.940 --> 00:39.450
It's the first time a ship is
aligned manually for re-entry.

00:39.460 --> 00:42.780
The First Secretary says
it's one more proof

00:42.940 --> 00:44.660
of the Soviet pilot's superiority.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.020
Congratulations comrade.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.220
He can go fuck himself!

00:47.540 --> 00:48.700
Repeat Soyuz?

00:49.740 --> 00:51.340
Pre-firing TDU.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.700
Shield OK. Entering white zone.

00:54.940 --> 00:55.940
Over.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:09.900 --> 01:10.920
Baikonur!

01:11.500 --> 01:14.180
Parachute light failure! Do you copy?

01:14.300 --> 01:15.740
Copy Soyuz.

01:16.180 --> 01:19.140
Control says it must be
an electrical problem.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.700
Negative!
Parachute unable to deploy, you understand?

01:25.940 --> 01:27.500
Try again Soyuz.

01:27.700 --> 01:28.700
That's all?

01:28.740 --> 01:31.900
I'm going too fast! I'm
going to crash, get it?

01:32.500 --> 01:33.520
Baikonur!

01:36.660 --> 01:37.680
Baikonur!

01:38.700 --> 01:39.720
Baikonur!

01:45.780 --> 01:47.300
What the...

02:51.060 --> 02:53.090
- Hi, Manon.
- Hi.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.650
I'm Jeanne.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.420
Do you like marshmallows?

02:56.460 --> 02:58.700
Yes? Here you go.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.020
For you.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.770
Now listen carefully.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.770
I'm going to leave for a while,

03:05.780 --> 03:07.770
you can eat it now,
or you can wait for me,

03:07.780 --> 03:10.080
and I'll give you a second one. Okay?

03:10.240 --> 03:12.410
When I get back, I'll give you
another one if you haven't eaten it.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.490
Okay? Great.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.980
Don't move, I'll be right back.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.660
So?

04:06.300 --> 04:10.770
Come on, you're wrong, she's
going to resist, I can feel it..

04:10.780 --> 04:12.380
Do you want to bet your dessert?

04:34.620 --> 04:37.420
If it's still here when I get
back, I'll give you another one.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.770
Breaking news: the
Ulysse crew is grieving,

04:51.780 --> 04:53.580
Anne De Ternay, the famous psychologist

04:53.580 --> 04:56.200
and eighth member of
the pioneer Mars mission

04:56.220 --> 04:57.990
died in the crash of the helicopter

04:57.990 --> 05:00.100
taking her to the Kourou Space Center.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.690
Swiss billionaire William Meyer
who came up with the Ulysse mission

05:03.700 --> 05:06.730
has just announced that despite the
passing of the crew psychologist,

05:06.740 --> 05:08.420
he will carry on with his goal

05:08.420 --> 05:11.570
to be the first manned
mission to land on Mars.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.170
He plans to launch on
schedule in only ten days.

05:15.180 --> 05:18.470
The famous astronaut couple
Alessandra and Martin Najac

05:18.470 --> 05:20.650
landed in Guiana a few hours ago,

05:20.980 --> 05:22.150
and despite the tragedy,

05:22.150 --> 05:24.900
the preparations for the
mission are still in full swing.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.320
The question now is:

05:28.320 --> 05:30.150
who will be the eighth passenger
on the European mission to Mars?

05:34.660 --> 05:38.540
10 MONTHS LATER

06:02.540 --> 06:03.660
Shit.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.060
Already?

06:18.340 --> 06:20.220
Our sessions are getting
shorter and shorter.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.340
You're pretty receptive.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.700
If I'd known, I would have
gone to therapy sooner.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.540
You would have had trouble
finding such a caring therapist.

06:37.380 --> 06:38.400
Jeanne.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.380
Commander.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.380
Listen to me.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.700
Please. I know what you're about to say.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.740
Don't ruin everything with feelings.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.900
Okay?

06:51.380 --> 06:53.620
<i>Commander, you are
expected at the briefing.</i>

07:04.540 --> 07:05.580
I'm going.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.900
Yes?

07:13.620 --> 07:15.900
Next time, at least make the bed.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.700
In 24 hours, we will land on Mars.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.300
Alex's outside recon
showed nothing troubling,

07:34.300 --> 07:36.140
the ship in in perfect shape,

07:36.140 --> 07:37.980
we have the go-ahead from Earth.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.220
Irene.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.020
<i>Ready for the checklist
control, Commander.</i>

07:43.020 --> 07:44.700
- Great. Yann.
- Yeah.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.260
Here are the different scenarios
proposed by propulsion control.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.960
I know it's indiscreet

07:53.960 --> 07:57.390
but have you already sent your
psychological evaluation to Earth?

07:58.540 --> 08:01.700
You do know I'm not
supposed to reveal anything.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.940
Yeah, I guess when you
spend 240 billion euros

08:05.940 --> 08:08.170
of your own fortune
for a mission to Mars,

08:08.260 --> 08:10.100
you get to bend the rules.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.340
- Exactly.
- I see.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.300
Which version do you want?

08:13.580 --> 08:14.820
Mine, or the official one?

08:15.780 --> 08:16.900
They're different?

08:17.780 --> 08:18.860
Oh yes, very.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.460
Let's start with the official one.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.600
Well, everything is fine on board.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.810
Nothing to report, we can land safely.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.860
I never doubted it.
And the unofficial one?

08:29.860 --> 08:31.550
The ten months of travel have revealed

08:31.560 --> 08:33.730
serious neurosis in
several of the crew members.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.100
Basile has developed
symptoms of sociopathy,

08:38.100 --> 08:40.549
he didn't talk to anyone,
except Irene of course,

08:40.549 --> 08:42.909
for a week and no one noticed.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.790
Gramat, second in command,

08:45.790 --> 08:47.580
has willingly pulled away
from the chain of command,

08:47.590 --> 08:49.740
him and the commander
barely talk anymore.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.800
The commander has marital troubles,

08:51.800 --> 08:55.930
clearly affecting his
judgment and decisions.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.460
And I think Alessandra is
going through a depression.

08:59.460 --> 09:00.900
There it is.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.820
- As for you, for the last two weeks...
- Yeah, thanks.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.370
So if I were to give a
detailed and unbiased opinion,

09:08.370 --> 09:10.850
I would advise against landing on Mars.

09:13.140 --> 09:16.980
I think we'll stick the the
first version, if you don't mind.

09:16.980 --> 09:19.460
Mr Meyer, anything to say to the crew?

09:19.460 --> 09:20.660
Right, yes.

09:28.500 --> 09:34.660
Four years ago - time flies -
I had a dream to go to Mars.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.220
I dedicated most of my fortune to it,

09:39.180 --> 09:42.700
I wanted to discover a new world,
and maybe give my life some meaning.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.460
Well here we are kids,
tomorrow we land on Mars.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.620
But we won't be the first.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.280
Excuse me?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.980
A competing American
mission got a jump on us.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.260
They landed two weeks ago.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.300
- What?
- NASA? It doesn't make any sense.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.110
That's fucking stupid.

10:02.110 --> 10:03.780
NASA is only their partner,

10:03.780 --> 10:06.060
the company Zillion
is behind this mission.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.740
Z1, as they call it.

10:10.540 --> 10:13.140
It traveled to Mars in
less than three weeks.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.300
Three weeks? How is that possible?

10:15.300 --> 10:18.140
With a new system of nuclear propulsion.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.460
We were crossed by your
competition, is that it?

10:21.380 --> 10:24.660
I want to say it's only half a failure,

10:24.660 --> 10:26.660
that it's part of the game,

10:26.660 --> 10:30.460
but I prefer honesty, and
honestly, we got fucked.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.940
The problem is that Earth
hasn't heard from them.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.260
Except for one video.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.060
- Irene, please. <i>
- Yes, Commander.</i>

10:44.700 --> 10:45.940
If you're getting this message it means...

10:48.340 --> 10:49.380
Don't come here.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.580
Don't try and save us.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.020
It's too dangerous.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.580
When did you get this?

11:04.100 --> 11:05.580
A week ago.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.300
And you're warning us
24 hours in advance.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
It changes everything, it's
dangerous and we know nothing...

11:09.300 --> 11:11.540
You agreed to be in danger
when you set foot on this ship.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.420
It's different, we should delay
the landing, Yann tell him.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.340
Of course he's right,

11:15.340 --> 11:18.250
we should at least be in
orbit until we understand...

11:18.260 --> 11:20.030
It's exactly because
of reactions like these

11:20.030 --> 11:21.600
that we decided to say nothing.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.220
And this is not a democracy.

11:23.220 --> 11:26.780
So whether we like it or not,
we now have a rescue mission.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.860
The only way to know
what happened is to land.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.340
Tomorrow will be the most
important day of you lives. Go.

11:34.620 --> 11:35.780
<i>Simon, wait.</i>

11:57.660 --> 11:58.860
Aren't you going to bed ?

12:00.700 --> 12:01.760
I'm not tired.

12:03.380 --> 12:04.460
Are you okay?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.260
I can't stop thinking about what we saw.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.500
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.480
A mission like that can
fail for a lot of reasons.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.040
Technical problems maybe.
Or they suffocated.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.940
- Or they went crazy, you know.
- Yeah thanks, that's reassuring.

12:17.860 --> 12:20.660
I didn't mean it like that.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.820
- Maybe I can help you.
- No, I'm good, thanks.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.980
Eva, it's gonna be alright.

12:31.500 --> 12:37.660
- Really?
- I swear. I swear on your ameba.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.260
Come here, come.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.060
I'm going to bed.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.500
Goodnight.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.620
- Irene. <i>
- Yes Basile?</i>

13:10.620 --> 13:12.780
Can you show me the
feed from the lab please.

13:12.780 --> 13:13.860
<i>Of course.</i>

13:17.620 --> 13:18.700
How does he do it?

13:18.900 --> 13:19.980
<i>What do you mean?</i>

13:19.980 --> 13:21.020
You know what I mean.

13:21.020 --> 13:21.940
<i>No.</i>

13:23.500 --> 13:24.700
She won't give me the time of day.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.140
<i>She doesn't have a watch.</i>

13:26.140 --> 13:28.140
Come on, I taught you the phrase.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.140
<i>It was a form of humor.</i>

13:31.100 --> 13:32.500
Well it's not funny.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.740
<i>If I can't make you laugh, I
don't see how I could help you</i>

13:35.740 --> 13:37.900
<i>get along with the rest of the crew.</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:40.100
And with Ms. Müller in particular.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.220
I get along with you.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.220
<i>You programmed me for that.</i>

14:38.500 --> 14:40.300
Can't fall asleep?

14:48.660 --> 14:49.660
Nervous?

14:51.420 --> 14:53.980
I'm the crew's therapist,
I shouldn't answer.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.900
I'm scared to death.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.820
Aren't you?

15:05.260 --> 15:07.820
You see that shiny star over there?

15:08.900 --> 15:10.220
That's Earth.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.700
Tomorrow when we land, I'm not
sure I'll be able to see it anymore.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.660
That's what scares me.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.140
You should have told me about it.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.940
An astronaut who admits she's homesick?

15:27.940 --> 15:29.140
No way.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.420
When I was a kid, my father
took me to see the stars.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.180
All night long.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.580
He had a telescope.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.220
I loved to help him assemble it.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.830
I didn't understand
everything of course,

15:43.830 --> 15:45.300
but he explained it, patiently.

15:46.220 --> 15:47.610
And every night at sunset,

15:47.610 --> 15:50.050
he showed me this tiny
red dot on the horizon,

15:50.980 --> 15:52.820
and he would say, "Mars is here".

15:55.020 --> 15:57.860
It meant that we were going to
start observing the rest of the sky.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.220
That's a nice story.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.980
I understand.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.940
Who speaks first, you or me?

16:28.180 --> 16:30.620
I'm still trying to understand how
you were chosen for this mission.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.820
I wasn't the first choice.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.390
You shouldn't have
been on the list at all,

16:33.390 --> 16:34.790
even Basile is more sociable than you.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.820
It's part of my job to
stay in the background.

16:36.820 --> 16:37.840
Like with Najac?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.500
You really think she doesn't
see it? That she's not hurt?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
There hasn't been anything
between them for a long time.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.580
I think you just don't
care. About anything.

16:44.580 --> 16:48.300
What you don't understand is
that I slept with him and not you.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.660
You think you're so irresistible.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.420
The truth is, you're upset.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.740
<i>Calculations of atmospheric
entry trajectory completed.</i>

17:23.940 --> 17:25.740
<i>Ready for shuttle separation.</i>

17:26.339 --> 17:28.780
In an hour we'll be having
a picnic on Mars my friends.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.420
If we make it in one piece.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.180
Optimism, Gramat.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.420
<i>Warning: artificial gravity
will stop upon separation</i>

17:39.420 --> 17:42.780
<i>from the orbital ship Argos
and our return shuttle Circé.</i>

17:42.780 --> 17:44.780
Yann, how's the ship?

17:46.140 --> 17:47.380
All systems are go.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.940
We have a window for atmospheric entry.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.620
Separation in 5

17:56.180 --> 17:57.380
Release!

18:01.740 --> 18:03.500
What is it now? Irene?

18:03.500 --> 18:05.140
<i>The ship hasn't separated.</i>

18:05.140 --> 18:07.820
<i>The unhooking system seems
to be failing, Commander.</i>

18:07.820 --> 18:09.500
- Great start.
- What does it mean?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.340
Argos's engines are not strong
enough to keep us in low orbit.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.780
If we don't separate,
we'll crash on Mars.

18:14.780 --> 18:16.780
And burn a little too.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.340
That's a problem, isn't it?

18:18.340 --> 18:21.090
Shut up. We have to go
out and unhook it manually

18:21.090 --> 18:22.280
before atmospheric entry.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.190
No, descent has already started.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.750
If we do one more orbit,
I'll have to fire up the engines.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.060
- We need the fuel.
- We don't have a fucking choice.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.780
Alex, ready to go out?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.780
No.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.420
Alex, are you okay?

18:39.900 --> 18:41.460
Commander, what are you doing?

18:41.460 --> 18:45.100
I'm going out. Find an entry
window after this orbit.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.780
Commander, you can't go out.
You know it's against protocol.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.500
Non-negotiable. Try to
keep the ship high enough.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.240
I'll be right back.

18:59.980 --> 19:03.140
We want to keep the ship high
enough to make an extra round.

19:03.150 --> 19:05.710
<i>The use of Ulysse fuel
to keep the ship in orbit </i>

19:05.710 --> 19:07.590
<i>could compromise landing.</i>

19:07.780 --> 19:10.220
- It's not meant for that, Simon.
- No shit.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.860
Irene, how are the thrust calculations?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.860
<i>Calculations complete.</i>

19:16.620 --> 19:19.060
<i>Airlock depressurization
complete, Commander.</i>

19:20.060 --> 19:21.300
I'm ready.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
Irene, how much time do I have?

19:39.100 --> 19:41.060
<i>You have three minutes to detach Ulysse</i>

19:41.060 --> 19:42.470
<i>before atmospheric entry.</i>

19:42.940 --> 19:44.220
Tether yourself, please.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.660
I don't have time.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.100
Wait, Irene can you please
zoom in on the landing site?

19:59.180 --> 20:00.220
Fuck.

20:00.220 --> 20:01.980
What now? Yann?

20:03.740 --> 20:04.800
Shit...

20:04.940 --> 20:05.980
It can't be...

20:06.860 --> 20:09.740
There are suspended sand
volutes around the landing site.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.540
It looks like some
kind of massive storm.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.520
Just what we needed.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.300
The hooks are stuck.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.020
The structure deformed under duress.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.620
<i>You have one minute left, Commander.</i>

20:55.860 --> 20:57.980
<i>Separation of Argos module in progress.</i>

21:04.580 --> 21:07.420
Martin, come back in. I don't
want to land without you.

21:07.420 --> 21:10.340
We're about to get out,
I don't want it to...

21:12.460 --> 21:13.520
Martin?

21:15.420 --> 21:16.500
Answer me!

21:18.940 --> 21:21.820
Commander, answer me.

21:26.860 --> 21:28.420
<i>Moving to weightlessness.</i>

21:30.060 --> 21:31.340
We can't leave him.

21:31.900 --> 21:35.140
Simon, he has twelve hours
of oxygen left. Can't we...

21:35.140 --> 21:37.020
No, we don't have enough fuel.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.380
Our only chance is to
land now, if we don't...

21:39.380 --> 21:41.180
You can't do this! Please!

21:41.180 --> 21:42.180
We have no choice.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.740
Preparing for descent.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.980
I feel like the picnic is
turning into a barbecue!

22:18.780 --> 22:22.020
<i>Battery failure. Power insufficient.</i>

22:22.180 --> 22:24.100
<i>Switching off all systems.</i>

22:24.820 --> 22:26.380
Irene is going into safety mode.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.900
What the hell Irene?

22:29.660 --> 22:32.060
We only have enough
power for manual controls.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.180
Old school.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.020
We'll have to time the thrusting.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.180
I don't have a watch, Yann.

22:38.180 --> 22:41.220
No but you have me. And we
have just enough fuel for that.

22:42.140 --> 22:44.580
Well, unless the storm
makes us crash down.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.100
We're in free fall!

22:52.100 --> 22:53.900
Wait.

22:59.460 --> 23:00.580
Keep waiting.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.540
I can see the ground!

23:04.540 --> 23:06.460
Thrust, go!

23:12.620 --> 23:14.860
Shut the engines before touchdown!

23:45.940 --> 23:47.140
We fell 20 meters.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.180
No leaks. We're out of fuel.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.980
We made it.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.580
I don't mean to be a buzz kill,
but I can't reboot Irene.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.700
So without the on-board
computer, no life support system.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.540
And without the life support system,

24:04.220 --> 24:06.140
we'll all be dead in 24 hours.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.100
Welcome to Mars.
