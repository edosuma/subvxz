00:38.938 --> 00:40.200
What's your name?

00:40.974 --> 00:42.134
Mosquito

00:43.610 --> 00:46.078
Why did those mad dogs pick on you?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.379
For a chicken leg

00:49.582 --> 00:50.640
Huh?

01:00.994 --> 01:02.621
Want me to go with you?

01:03.530 --> 01:04.587
No

01:06.633 --> 01:07.964
Not the first time anyway

01:08.168 --> 01:09.294
I can go by myself

01:44.437 --> 01:45.165
Sorry

01:59.619 --> 02:01.678
Three schools in two years, huh?

02:01.888 --> 02:04.823
Missed classes for half semester
when you were in Grove Town

02:04.991 --> 02:08.154
You been busy, huh?
Lots of business going on?

02:08.595 --> 02:09.323
Nah

02:09.529 --> 02:10.826
No?

02:11.030 --> 02:11.894
I'm telling you,

02:12.098 --> 02:13.429
you better behave, well

02:13.633 --> 02:15.260
and finish school here

02:15.468 --> 02:16.765
Don't mess around

02:17.871 --> 02:18.803
Huh?

02:19.005 --> 02:19.835
Uh-huh

02:20.039 --> 02:21.097
Uh-huh, what you mean by uh-huh?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.740
Taking shit uh-huh, huh?

02:27.780 --> 02:28.769
Gambling, eh?

02:28.982 --> 02:31.348
You've got some guts, huh?

02:31.551 --> 02:35.009
Hands forward, forward

03:17.263 --> 03:17.661
(The new guy)

03:17.797 --> 03:18.764
(On the dike, tomorrow after school)

03:18.831 --> 03:20.162
(Bring NT$3000 to pay your respect)

03:20.300 --> 03:21.232
(Or else... )

03:31.744 --> 03:32.438
What the fuck

03:35.148 --> 03:36.240
Loser

03:37.317 --> 03:38.511
You need some beating

03:47.360 --> 03:48.418
Boss Dog Boy

03:48.628 --> 03:49.959
You eat my lunch everyday

03:50.163 --> 03:51.596
My nanny says I've become too skinny

03:51.798 --> 03:52.526
Too skinny?

03:53.266 --> 03:55.393
Your nanny's blind or somethin'

03:55.501 --> 03:56.866
Talkin'shit

04:05.979 --> 04:07.469
What you eating that fast for?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.183
Hey, Grove guy

04:21.628 --> 04:23.391
Haven't paid your bill this month?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.724
It's OK, you can pay with a chicken leg

04:26.933 --> 04:28.195
Collected by me, Mr. Dog Boy

04:30.837 --> 04:31.496
Welcome, you're now listening to

04:31.704 --> 04:34.537
Mr. Lee's "Hour of Sensibility"

04:34.741 --> 04:40.179
This is a barbequed chicken leg
from the Grove guy

05:25.191 --> 05:26.089
Don't run!

05:44.277 --> 05:45.676
Dice go!

05:45.878 --> 05:47.311
You need only five

05:47.513 --> 05:48.036
C'mon

05:48.247 --> 05:49.976
Again, again

05:50.883 --> 05:51.941
Hit it

05:56.055 --> 05:58.114
So many of them picking on one?

06:04.564 --> 06:06.464
Where the hell is this fag from?

06:06.666 --> 06:08.065
Just got transferred

06:09.135 --> 06:10.932
See how far you can go

06:49.942 --> 06:50.966
Get him up

06:58.951 --> 06:59.883
Go ahead and run

07:00.086 --> 07:01.883
You fucker keep running!

07:02.088 --> 07:03.817
You run fast

07:05.291 --> 07:07.020
Playing dumb in front of your daddy?

07:13.633 --> 07:14.793
Shit

07:22.375 --> 07:23.364
What're you doing?

07:37.890 --> 07:39.084
What about that?

07:39.792 --> 07:40.759
Not bad

08:13.025 --> 08:14.458
Where's your manners?

08:27.139 --> 08:28.367
Scar, cigarettes

08:29.542 --> 08:31.567
This is a beauty salon, not a barber shop

08:31.777 --> 08:33.404
What's wrong with him?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.672
I'll tend to your wound in a minute

08:50.129 --> 08:50.925
Scar

08:54.634 --> 08:55.259
Sister Ling

08:55.468 --> 08:57.527
What's this for, no

08:57.737 --> 09:00.331
You have already sent
so many flower banquets

09:01.140 --> 09:03.199
You also spent quite a lot
when you took over the business

09:03.409 --> 09:04.933
How could you say no to my cash gift?

09:10.316 --> 09:11.442
Bye, Sister Ling

09:41.547 --> 09:43.014
Pay 50 bucks to get through

09:56.729 --> 09:58.390
Want to be friends?

09:59.532 --> 10:00.794
Fuck off

10:03.469 --> 10:04.993
Did you get that chick yesterday?

10:05.204 --> 10:05.863
She ran away

10:06.072 --> 10:07.596
Loser

10:21.187 --> 10:22.814
What?

10:23.022 --> 10:23.613
I beat up the newbie

10:23.823 --> 10:25.450
what's that to do with you Temple Front?

10:25.658 --> 10:27.888
Excuse me, Mr. Boss Dog Boy

10:28.094 --> 10:30.028
Just a notice

10:30.229 --> 10:33.357
From now on,
his business is my business

10:33.566 --> 10:36.034
His enemy, is my enemy

10:36.235 --> 10:38.226
Whatever people owes him

10:38.437 --> 10:40.496
I'll get it back for him

10:40.706 --> 10:42.936
Whatever he doesn't want from people

10:43.142 --> 10:45.110
I will give it back for him

10:46.278 --> 10:48.212
Would you please tell me

10:48.414 --> 10:51.144
Did you pick on him yesterday?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.416
Dragon Lee

10:54.620 --> 10:55.678
Don't pick on me

10:55.888 --> 10:57.788
when my cousin is in jail

10:59.659 --> 11:01.126
Pick on you

11:02.028 --> 11:04.861
Just like you called up those body
builders to pick on him yesterday?

11:08.134 --> 11:09.294
Making him pay respect, huh?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.671
This is your turf, huh?

11:18.377 --> 11:20.777
Now, nobody is picking on anybody

11:20.980 --> 11:24.245
Now I am asking you, fair and square

11:24.717 --> 11:26.742
Did you pick on him yesterday?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.782
How nice, everyone's here

11:30.990 --> 11:36.622
I, Dragon Lee, is here,
no one dares to hit back, so be my guest

12:22.708 --> 12:25.506
Do me a favor, the new guy

12:25.711 --> 12:28.179
Can you make it quick,
10 minutes have passed

12:28.380 --> 12:31.144
You don't really need that much thinking

12:45.698 --> 12:47.598
If you don't fuck'em up today

12:48.968 --> 12:51.061
One day they'll fuck you up

14:04.577 --> 14:07.910
My name is Chou Yi-Mong,
friends call me Mosquito

14:08.113 --> 14:10.843
I moved to Monga when I was 1 7

14:11.050 --> 14:14.611
I became a gangster,
because of a chicken leg

14:22.628 --> 14:23.890
All this fighting, is there a meaning to it?

14:24.096 --> 14:25.563
What the fuck is meaning?

14:28.467 --> 14:31.061
Your daddy only know brotherhood,
never heard of meaning

15:47.780 --> 15:50.613
Since I was little,
I had no father, no friends

15:50.816 --> 15:53.649
I was bullied by
all the neighbors and kids

15:59.992 --> 16:02.051
Until I met my brothers

16:02.261 --> 16:04.422
My life seemed to have some meaning

16:04.630 --> 16:05.688
No

16:05.898 --> 16:07.263
What the fuck is meaning?

16:07.466 --> 16:08.956
All I know, is brotherhood

16:10.736 --> 16:11.998
Dragon Lee

16:12.204 --> 16:15.696
The only son of Geta,
the boss of Monga Temple Front

16:15.908 --> 16:19.241
A street prince born with a silver spoon

16:19.445 --> 16:20.969
As the son of a gangster boss

16:21.180 --> 16:21.646
Naturally

16:21.847 --> 16:24.213
all the kids respect him as the big brother

16:24.416 --> 16:25.610
Since he's little

16:25.818 --> 16:28.514
he's been the gangster force on campus,
maintaining the orders

16:28.721 --> 16:30.586
So much so, that the word Brotherhood,
in his definition

16:30.789 --> 16:33.553
Has everything to do with Power

16:33.759 --> 16:35.351
(Protection fee, 500)

16:35.561 --> 16:38.155
However, the one who really has
what it takes to be a boss, is him

16:38.364 --> 16:41.299
Monk, real name Ho Tien-Yo

16:41.500 --> 16:43.229
His family owns
a Buddhist Accessory Shop

16:43.435 --> 16:44.800
When he's 5, a fortune-teller

16:45.004 --> 16:46.266
determined that this kid
was to become a gangster

16:46.472 --> 16:49.100
(Your boy is destined to be a gangster)

16:49.308 --> 16:52.800
His dad therefore asked his best friend
Geta to look after him

16:53.012 --> 16:54.377
Monk is extremely intelligent

16:54.580 --> 16:57.674
Showed amazing talent as early as
in elementary school

16:57.883 --> 17:00.750
He can finish test papers
for 4 people at once

17:08.961 --> 17:10.484
Each year,
he won six championships at school:

17:10.695 --> 17:13.858
writing, speech, reading, spelling

17:14.066 --> 17:16.397
calligraphy and art

17:16.602 --> 17:18.194
(Boss, the high mountain tea
you ordered is here)

17:18.404 --> 17:21.339
Because he has high IQ,
and he's resourceful and well-mannered

17:21.540 --> 17:22.369
Comparing to any of us

17:22.574 --> 17:25.474
Monk does everything with
more ease and professionalism

17:25.676 --> 17:27.872
Growing up with Dragon

17:28.079 --> 17:30.014
Monk only cares for Dragon

17:30.215 --> 17:31.307
The way I see it

17:31.517 --> 17:34.042
His definition of brotherhood is

17:34.553 --> 17:36.544
Incomprehensible to others

17:38.891 --> 17:41.257
A-Po, Huang Wan-Po

17:41.460 --> 17:43.223
An underdog
who knows best about survival

17:43.429 --> 17:45.260
(I've been a butcher all my life)

17:45.464 --> 17:46.988
(How come my son is such a coward?)

17:47.132 --> 17:50.761
He claims that he's killed 233 pigs

17:51.170 --> 17:53.866
Done 107 women

17:54.540 --> 17:56.030
Kicked 375 people's asses

17:56.241 --> 17:57.708
(376,379... )

17:57.910 --> 18:01.778
Brotherhood for him,
is a means to hustle around

18:01.980 --> 18:04.346
A truth only idiots would buy into

18:05.184 --> 18:06.845
The idiot A-Po refers to

18:07.052 --> 18:08.815
Would be Monkey

18:10.389 --> 18:13.381
Monkey, real name Hou Chun-Sheng

18:13.592 --> 18:15.856
His dad died soon after he was born

18:16.061 --> 18:18.495
His mom ran away with some man
(On my white horse)

18:18.697 --> 18:20.187
His grandpa raised him

18:20.399 --> 18:22.560
(Through three territories)

18:22.768 --> 18:27.171
(This is my line, who the heck are you?)

18:27.339 --> 18:28.237
(I am Chun-Sheng)

18:28.440 --> 18:29.134
Just like me

18:29.341 --> 18:31.502
Monkey was often bullied as a kid

18:31.710 --> 18:32.768
What's different is

18:32.978 --> 18:33.740
When he turned 10

18:33.946 --> 18:36.710
He Suddenly realized
that he was good at fighting

18:36.915 --> 18:38.507
Since then,
he's the one beating people up

18:38.717 --> 18:40.412
No one can hit him

18:41.520 --> 18:42.646
It was in the same year

18:42.855 --> 18:46.018
That Dragon recruited him,
and he became a gangster kid

18:56.502 --> 18:57.469
I took on three all by myself

18:57.669 --> 18:59.398
You're talking shit

20:45.711 --> 20:47.679
The highest record we ever made

20:47.879 --> 20:51.542
was to pick up a mass fight
among all gangs in Monga

20:52.551 --> 20:53.643
It was that night

20:53.852 --> 20:55.319
that five of us became sworn brothers

20:55.520 --> 20:56.987
and formed the Prince Gang

20:57.189 --> 20:59.180
Were not born on the same day

20:59.391 --> 21:02.121
But are willing to die on the same day

21:02.327 --> 21:05.819
Shall anyone think twice, will be punished
by the Master God of Monga

21:06.031 --> 21:08.864
To have the limbs broken
and die an ugly death

21:32.691 --> 21:38.596
Hey.
What do you want to do the most in life?

21:39.931 --> 21:42.058
Join the gang, be the boss

21:43.468 --> 21:45.299
You wanna replace me?

21:48.173 --> 21:51.267
If I become the boss,
then you'll be the boss's boss

21:53.278 --> 21:56.179
Sweet talker

21:57.683 --> 21:59.275
What if you ain't in the gang?

21:59.484 --> 22:00.974
If Monk wasn't a gangster

22:01.186 --> 22:03.450
he could get a PhD and win Nobel prize

22:03.655 --> 22:05.816
Anyway he's gotta be someone big lah

22:06.358 --> 22:09.555
If I ain't in the gang, what would I be?

22:09.761 --> 22:13.527
Eighteen Copper Men conquer the world
with Shaolin Kung-Fu

22:14.900 --> 22:16.993
Famous traditional kung-fu medicine

22:17.202 --> 22:18.533
Go back to sleep

22:22.908 --> 22:26.435
What about you,
what you wanna do the most?

22:27.813 --> 22:33.308
Me, I wanna go to Japan

22:35.120 --> 22:36.246
And do what?

22:40.592 --> 22:41.889
Go see the cherry blossoms

22:42.294 --> 22:43.886
So "romantico"

22:46.765 --> 22:50.565
My dad sent home a postcard
from Japan before he died

22:50.769 --> 22:53.465
On it,
there's cherry blossoms all over the sky

22:58.110 --> 23:01.011
He got passed on some kind of disease
two months after he got there

23:02.881 --> 23:04.143
He probably died not even

23:04.349 --> 23:05.907
knowing I was born

23:14.559 --> 23:16.117
Have you ever seen cherry blossoms?

23:44.456 --> 23:47.687
Look, cherry blossom

23:53.131 --> 23:55.292
Here, to your dad

24:13.819 --> 24:15.650
Fuck! What you splashed on me with?

24:15.854 --> 24:16.878
Pee, of course

24:17.088 --> 24:19.056
Bitch, asshole

24:19.257 --> 24:21.316
You can't get me, won't get me

24:23.962 --> 24:24.656
Don't go.

25:01.867 --> 25:02.561
Thanks

25:05.203 --> 25:05.965
Hey

25:08.940 --> 25:10.373
What you had was broken

25:10.575 --> 25:11.837
Got you a new one

25:13.345 --> 25:14.312
Takin' off

25:36.301 --> 25:37.461
Not sleeping yet?

25:44.409 --> 25:45.808
What's going on?

25:47.345 --> 25:49.142
How's school?

25:50.348 --> 25:53.806
Ok, nothing special

25:54.753 --> 25:56.118
Just the way it is

26:05.397 --> 26:06.364
(Notification for Absence without Leave)

26:06.565 --> 26:09.159
I've never asked you to get good grades

26:09.367 --> 26:10.834
All I want is that you graduate

26:11.036 --> 26:12.936
Graduate from high school, that's it

26:13.138 --> 26:14.935
Is that too much to ask?

26:16.741 --> 26:19.141
with the Temple Front
hooligans all the time?

26:21.546 --> 26:23.343
Will there be a future
for you sticking with them?

26:25.183 --> 26:27.310
There's no such thing as future
for someone like me

26:27.519 --> 26:28.713
Say that again

26:31.423 --> 26:32.082
I wouldn't have survived school

26:32.290 --> 26:33.882
if they didn't watch my back

26:34.092 --> 26:35.252
You don't steal, rob,
or do anything unspeakable,

26:35.460 --> 26:37.690
why do you need them to protect you?

26:37.896 --> 26:40.364
What about you?
Aren't you doing the same thing?

26:40.565 --> 26:42.897
We just moved here, and you already
hooked up with the Mainlanders

26:43.101 --> 26:44.363
What kind of mindset's that?

26:44.569 --> 26:47.060
Don't you also
need someone to watch your back?

26:54.646 --> 26:56.170
We're sworn brothers now

26:59.351 --> 27:01.615
I never had any friends since I was little

27:02.621 --> 27:04.088
This is the first time

27:24.109 --> 27:25.133
Happy birthday

27:28.113 --> 27:29.637
How do you know it's my birthday?

27:29.848 --> 27:31.577
I have my way to find out

27:31.783 --> 27:33.250
Let's go celebrate

27:34.519 --> 27:35.508
Move it

27:59.310 --> 28:00.174
How's it?

28:00.378 --> 28:01.402
Take a look

28:08.486 --> 28:11.751
Not bad huh, do you like it?

28:12.724 --> 28:13.782
Thanks

28:30.308 --> 28:31.434
Dragon, big bro

28:31.643 --> 28:34.544
Come, come. Come on in

28:52.263 --> 28:54.731
Woo-hoo! Love birds

28:54.933 --> 28:56.457
Get lost

28:57.102 --> 28:58.194
Ignore them

29:20.158 --> 29:22.649
Mosquito, Mosquito

29:23.561 --> 29:24.619
Drink up

29:25.430 --> 29:26.829
I'll puke if I drink more

29:27.031 --> 29:28.430
Are we brothers or not?

30:03.401 --> 30:06.495
Monk, Mosquito, come on, dance

30:06.704 --> 30:07.762
Hurry up

30:07.972 --> 30:09.337
Get movin'

30:10.542 --> 30:11.406
Let's go

30:34.833 --> 30:35.993
Monkey

30:44.776 --> 30:46.038
Dance with them

30:47.312 --> 30:48.210
No, I can't dance

30:48.413 --> 30:53.578
Hate, love, commotion in my heart

30:53.785 --> 30:59.485
This trap, trap, trap, why me?

31:01.960 --> 31:04.428
Hey, isn't it time to give our
b-day boy the present?

31:12.770 --> 31:13.702
Mosquito

31:15.240 --> 31:16.502
Aren't we going to get some squid soup?

31:16.708 --> 31:19.006
Let's have it to go, you go get it

31:19.210 --> 31:19.972
Oh

31:22.480 --> 31:23.947
Remember to tell the owner it's
for the Temple Front

31:24.148 --> 31:25.638
This way he'll add extra squid, hear me?

31:25.850 --> 31:26.646
OK

31:39.397 --> 31:42.992
Hi, 5 squid soups to go,
it's for the Temple Front

31:44.202 --> 31:46.762
Five to go, for the Temple Front

32:09.027 --> 32:09.857
Temple Front

32:15.533 --> 32:18.195
Damn Temple Front,
don't run! Knock him dead!

32:20.104 --> 32:21.128
Don't run!

32:26.811 --> 32:28.438
Temple Front! Get him!

32:29.547 --> 32:30.275
Don't go

32:30.481 --> 32:31.641
Kill him!

32:58.843 --> 32:59.673
Wow, they're coming, coming, coming

32:59.811 --> 33:02.644
Wow, super fast, 9 minutes 35 seconds

33:14.959 --> 33:15.653
Mosquito

33:23.735 --> 33:30.402
(The priest undertaking fear
expel ceremony for Mosquito)

33:41.119 --> 33:43.110
Hey, sorry about the squid soups

33:43.321 --> 33:45.016
Should I go get them again?

33:45.223 --> 33:46.281
Get them again?

33:53.865 --> 33:54.991
What you laughing about?

33:55.199 --> 33:57.190
Jeez, you're unbelievable

33:57.402 --> 33:58.130
You almost got killed

33:58.336 --> 33:59.701
and you're going back there again?

33:59.904 --> 34:02.532
Hey Monk, enlighten him

34:04.375 --> 34:07.833
This is the Temple Front, our turf

34:09.313 --> 34:10.974
Monga, Since the Ching Dynasty
to the Japanese Era

34:11.181 --> 34:14.242
has always been
the busiest commercial center of Taipei

34:14.452 --> 34:16.147
It's like a gold mountain

34:16.353 --> 34:18.322
full of opportunities and dreams

34:18.523 --> 34:20.753
In places like this,
all kinds of people mixing together

34:20.958 --> 34:22.891
Someone needs to maintain

34:23.094 --> 34:24.721
the order and allocate the interests

34:24.929 --> 34:27.591
That's where a "Block Boss" steps in

34:27.799 --> 34:30.097
The streets and lanes are their borders

34:30.301 --> 34:32.792
Each takes care of things big
and small on his own turf

34:33.004 --> 34:35.666
Each protects the civilians on his turf

34:36.206 --> 34:37.969
Some say there are

34:38.176 --> 34:39.234
over 70 block bosses in Monga

34:39.444 --> 34:41.172
And some say over 30

34:41.379 --> 34:42.402
But no one knows

34:42.612 --> 34:44.170
for sure the actual number

34:44.382 --> 34:45.041
Haven't you been asking

34:45.248 --> 34:46.716
why we fight all the time?

34:46.918 --> 34:47.577
You get it now?

34:47.784 --> 34:49.116
Boss Dragon

34:49.320 --> 34:50.252
Anywhere in Monga

34:50.455 --> 34:51.888
mention Dragon's dad's name

34:52.090 --> 34:53.284
No one dares to touch you

34:53.491 --> 34:55.550
Because we, the Temple Front,
are Monga's most powerful

34:55.760 --> 34:57.159
If you run into those from the Back Alley,

34:57.361 --> 34:59.659
No need to say anything, just hit 'em

34:59.864 --> 35:01.331
Didn't we kick their ass the other day?

35:01.532 --> 35:03.227
And also those at the night market tonight

35:03.434 --> 35:05.368
Dragon Bro

35:05.570 --> 35:06.366
Have a cigarette

35:06.571 --> 35:09.199
No I'm good

35:09.407 --> 35:11.398
Give it to others

35:11.609 --> 35:14.373
Hey Dragon, what's your dad's name?

35:14.579 --> 35:17.104
Didn't I just tell you, Geta (Wooden clogs)

35:17.315 --> 35:20.375
The one that shielded off the sword
with two clogs

35:20.585 --> 35:22.985
Hey Dragon, your dad is really cool

35:23.788 --> 35:25.517
Hi, good day, good day

35:27.225 --> 35:28.317
Boss Geta

35:28.526 --> 35:31.586
Come here, eat

35:32.096 --> 35:33.529
Time to eat lah

35:43.674 --> 35:45.869
Lazy dude shits and pees a lot

35:46.077 --> 35:47.408
You use the toilet whenever it's time to eat

35:47.612 --> 35:49.409
My belly hurts, what can I do?

35:49.614 --> 35:50.603
Hey your kid is big

35:50.815 --> 35:52.248
you should go and register

35:52.450 --> 35:54.418
She wouldn't marry me

35:57.321 --> 36:00.654
Come on, meal time

36:00.858 --> 36:02.120
The kitchen ceiling is still leaking

36:02.326 --> 36:03.623
what did you do to fix it?

36:03.828 --> 36:04.419
Look

36:04.629 --> 36:05.220
Tomorrow,

36:05.363 --> 36:07.558
if I still have to wear
this shower cap when I cook

36:07.732 --> 36:09.597
You'll be the one that's leaking

36:11.869 --> 36:13.063
Ok, ok, take a break

36:13.271 --> 36:14.738
clean up and eat

36:18.576 --> 36:19.736
Wow, braised pork

36:19.944 --> 36:23.311
Oi, watch out for the hygiene,
not with your hands

36:24.081 --> 36:25.912
Come and eat

36:26.117 --> 36:26.879
Come on, eat lah

36:27.084 --> 36:28.278
Come and eat

36:29.220 --> 36:31.882
Is this the way of the gangster?
Not exactly what I imagined

36:32.089 --> 36:33.954
This, is the real Taiwanese gangster

36:34.158 --> 36:35.318
Vulgar and powerful

36:41.465 --> 36:42.227
Ma'am

36:44.702 --> 36:45.327
Mom

36:45.536 --> 36:46.867
No, I'm good, you go ahead

36:47.071 --> 36:47.696
Get you some rice?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.600
No, I am fed up

36:49.807 --> 36:51.138
I just lost 16,000

36:51.342 --> 36:53.207
to that Mei-ji bitch

36:53.411 --> 36:54.901
If I don't get it back next time
along with the interest

36:55.112 --> 36:56.807
I'll write my name backwards

36:57.014 --> 36:59.778
Mom, this is my sworn brother, Mosquito

37:00.518 --> 37:01.485
Hi there

37:01.919 --> 37:03.352
Alright, you guys carry on

37:12.630 --> 37:14.257
Boss, it's taken care of

37:14.465 --> 37:15.591
How'd it go?

37:16.033 --> 37:17.125
Kept wailing

37:17.335 --> 37:19.496
Ok lah, go sit down and eat

37:20.304 --> 37:21.168
Have a seat

37:25.543 --> 37:27.841
Riot at the Rocky Bay Prison

37:33.284 --> 37:34.808
They even sent in the SWAT team

37:35.753 --> 37:37.243
It's turned into such a big deal

37:50.534 --> 37:51.466
Take some of this

37:55.273 --> 37:59.642
This reduces your internal heat,
have some

38:04.015 --> 38:05.573
Get some more

38:14.058 --> 38:15.116
Dad you're home

38:20.164 --> 38:21.631
You were saying

38:21.832 --> 38:23.356
Wim-Kian's uncle

38:23.567 --> 38:25.057
Uh-huh

38:26.337 --> 38:27.634
Which uncle is it?

38:29.607 --> 38:31.040
Well it's Dog Boy's dad

38:31.609 --> 38:34.339
Oh, Doggy

38:48.059 --> 38:52.155
Wim-Kian is raised by Doggy

38:52.830 --> 38:56.459
He'll get even for sure

38:57.968 --> 38:59.492
You better watch out

39:03.507 --> 39:04.667
Boss

39:04.875 --> 39:07.605
Uncle lost 200 grand
at the Temple Front bookie

39:07.812 --> 39:09.473
He told them

39:09.680 --> 39:12.444
to collect from you when you come out

39:13.317 --> 39:15.478
But they insisted on
chopping down one of his fingers

39:21.592 --> 39:22.388
Fuck

39:23.594 --> 39:24.720
What you doing?

39:33.170 --> 39:35.263
Hey where the hell are we going?

39:35.473 --> 39:37.941
Just chill, you'll know in a minute

39:38.142 --> 39:39.040
Where's Monk?

39:39.810 --> 39:40.435
Boss Dragon

39:40.644 --> 39:41.474
There's no way he'd come for this

39:41.679 --> 39:43.271
He's not interested in women

39:44.148 --> 39:46.275
Try saying that to him next time
if you got the balls

39:46.484 --> 39:47.007
It is true

39:47.218 --> 39:47.946
He is Monk

39:48.152 --> 39:51.019
a monk should be vegetarian and celibate

39:51.222 --> 39:53.782
Exquisite Tower

39:53.991 --> 39:56.653
Tower is exquisite,
there are 13 stories in the Tower

39:56.861 --> 39:59.853
A temple in front of the Tower,
an old monk in the temple

40:00.064 --> 40:03.397
The old monk is the Master of six pupils

40:07.371 --> 40:08.702
See?

40:09.273 --> 40:10.433
Auntie has prepared

40:10.641 --> 40:13.974
swallow nests and shark fins for you

40:14.178 --> 40:16.942
Pick one you like and enjoy the tonic

40:17.148 --> 40:20.015
Feed yourself well, so you'll be strong

40:20.217 --> 40:22.879
Auntie, my dad doesn't let me
come to Treasure Borough,

40:23.053 --> 40:23.678
you know that right?

40:23.888 --> 40:24.752
I know lah

40:24.955 --> 40:25.478
Cow Dung

40:25.656 --> 40:26.088
Yes ma'am

40:26.223 --> 40:27.053
No one knows

40:27.191 --> 40:28.283
Boss Dragon was here, got it?

40:28.492 --> 40:28.890
I know lah

40:30.027 --> 40:32.188
Next!

40:32.930 --> 40:35.023
Auntie, get him a good one

40:35.232 --> 40:36.199
my treat

40:36.400 --> 40:39.096
Sure, leave it to me

40:40.171 --> 40:43.038
Little handsome, come, your turn

40:43.240 --> 40:46.266
Wait, I'll wait, they go first

40:48.446 --> 40:50.107
First timer, huh?

40:51.515 --> 40:53.745
Auntie will get you
a pretty one in a minute

40:53.951 --> 40:55.612
Make you lose your virginity tonight

40:55.820 --> 40:58.050
Then take a red envelope for good luck

40:58.255 --> 40:59.779
Auntie come in for a second

41:01.859 --> 41:04.760
Take your pick

41:04.962 --> 41:06.361
Don't be scared

41:29.487 --> 41:30.920
You scared the shit out of me

41:31.121 --> 41:33.885
Auntie,
how can you sell this kind of product?

41:36.360 --> 41:37.054
What you lookin' at?

41:37.261 --> 41:38.888
I'll dig your eyes out

41:42.566 --> 41:43.658
Her, I can do with her

42:03.020 --> 42:04.817
Did you go to
Show Shang Elementary School?

42:07.591 --> 42:08.751
Didn't you always carry your lunchbox

42:08.959 --> 42:11.427
in a washing powder bag?

42:17.968 --> 42:19.162
You're confusing me with someone else

42:32.016 --> 42:33.108
You

42:35.553 --> 42:37.350
Why do you want to be a hooker?

42:43.561 --> 42:44.585
What about you?

42:45.829 --> 42:47.262
Why do you want to be a gangster?

43:03.781 --> 43:05.544
Can we talk first?

43:16.961 --> 43:18.553
What's your name?

43:18.762 --> 43:19.751
Whatever

43:24.368 --> 43:25.528
I'm Mosquito

43:48.292 --> 43:49.623
Music?

43:52.663 --> 43:53.687
Whatever

45:03.734 --> 45:04.894
Thanks, come again

45:11.975 --> 45:12.703
Hey

45:14.812 --> 45:15.801
My name is Ning

45:17.514 --> 45:18.572
Oh

45:59.356 --> 46:00.345
Stop pouting

46:00.557 --> 46:01.080
I'm not pouting

46:01.291 --> 46:02.087
If you wanna see "Fatal Attraction"

46:02.292 --> 46:03.782
we can do it next time

46:03.994 --> 46:04.983
How was it?

46:05.496 --> 46:06.622
How was what?

46:06.830 --> 46:08.127
Was it good?

46:08.332 --> 46:09.959
With that birthmark girl yesterday

46:10.167 --> 46:10.724
No

46:10.934 --> 46:11.457
None of your business

46:11.668 --> 46:15.126
I don't want next time.
I wanna see it today

46:15.339 --> 46:17.603
Hey what's the fuss about?

46:17.741 --> 46:18.799
Everybody wants to see this one

46:18.976 --> 46:20.102
Everybody, everybody.
It's everybody again.

46:20.210 --> 46:20.869
No idea

46:23.914 --> 46:26.280
Fuck, mad woman

46:26.483 --> 46:29.577
What do you want?
Picking on me or what?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.778
I am not picking on you

46:31.989 --> 46:33.581
If only you did what you promised

46:39.129 --> 46:40.892
The "Project A" sequel is what I wanna see

46:41.098 --> 46:43.066
If you don't like it, then leave

47:12.663 --> 47:14.130
Excuse me, I am Dragon's friend

47:14.331 --> 47:15.525
You guys had a fight?

47:16.733 --> 47:18.200
He asked me to come look for you

47:18.402 --> 47:19.596
He wants to apologize

47:19.803 --> 47:20.963
He didn't earlier

47:21.171 --> 47:22.604
because the other guys were there

47:22.806 --> 47:23.864
You understand, right?

47:24.074 --> 47:26.338
Men don't like to look bad in front of friends

47:26.543 --> 47:27.635
He asked me to come get you

47:27.845 --> 47:28.812
He's waiting for you in the back

47:29.012 --> 47:31.810
Come this way, in the back

47:32.015 --> 47:33.346
This way

47:35.652 --> 47:36.550
In the back

47:42.192 --> 47:44.683
I just wanted to enjoy a movie with him

47:44.895 --> 47:45.987
And he invited those guys again

47:46.196 --> 47:47.925
I don't understand

47:50.000 --> 47:51.661
Why does he have to be like
this all the time?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.029
He's in the back

47:53.770 --> 47:54.759
Come, come here

48:00.744 --> 48:01.904
You know why?

48:03.347 --> 48:06.714
Because Dragon Lee is a freakin' fag

48:06.917 --> 48:09.408
Without those guys around all the time

48:10.220 --> 48:12.017
He'd be scared shitless

48:13.023 --> 48:14.217
You got me?

48:15.025 --> 48:16.117
Shush

48:42.219 --> 48:42.878
Hey

48:44.621 --> 48:45.588
Gotta go

48:45.789 --> 48:46.721
See you tomorrow

48:51.295 --> 48:52.284
Have you seen Hui?

49:03.240 --> 49:04.935
Fuck, you're shitting me

49:05.142 --> 49:05.801
Boss, I am not lying

49:06.009 --> 49:06.873
that chick is real hot

49:07.077 --> 49:07.907
Show me tomorrow then

49:08.111 --> 49:09.874
Sure, I'll take you tomorrow

49:33.303 --> 49:35.396
I have no idea what you're saying

49:36.773 --> 49:38.365
I didn't do anything

49:38.575 --> 49:39.940
Didn't do anything?

49:40.143 --> 49:42.236
Then why did you run?

49:43.180 --> 49:45.740
Gimme a break, you guys got weapons

49:45.949 --> 49:47.280
Who wouldn't run when they see you?

49:47.484 --> 49:48.610
Who knows,
maybe the Prince Gang is just

49:48.819 --> 49:50.309
itching to beat someone up

49:50.520 --> 49:52.351
Fuck, you're full of shit

49:52.556 --> 49:54.285
A man is responsible for his actions

49:54.491 --> 49:56.584
How come there's such garbage like you?

49:56.793 --> 49:58.090
I didn't do nothing

49:58.295 --> 49:59.455
I'm being framed

49:59.663 --> 50:02.097
Some fucking bitch set me up

50:02.299 --> 50:03.698
Shut his mouth

50:12.609 --> 50:15.305
Hey you can't be serious

50:18.115 --> 50:20.174
To be a man is to be serious

50:21.818 --> 50:24.218
First, I will seal your mouth

50:26.256 --> 50:27.348
And then left eye

50:28.358 --> 50:29.552
Then right eye

50:30.460 --> 50:31.552
Left ear

50:32.496 --> 50:33.656
Right ear

50:34.297 --> 50:35.594
Left nostril

50:36.500 --> 50:38.559
Then drive you into the mountains

50:38.769 --> 50:40.896
Dig a hole, throw you in there

50:41.104 --> 50:43.436
Pour in vitriol, and then fill up the hole

50:43.640 --> 50:45.733
Monk, you can't do this

50:45.942 --> 50:48.672
What you gonna say to my cousin?

50:50.280 --> 50:52.373
Why do I have to explain to Wim-Kian?

50:52.582 --> 50:54.345
I don't belong to the Back Alley,
I am from the Temple Front

50:54.551 --> 50:56.212
Are you fucked up in the head?

50:56.920 --> 50:58.820
Besides, having done something like that

50:59.022 --> 50:59.784
You are the one

50:59.990 --> 51:01.981
who should figure out
what to say to Wim-Kian

51:02.692 --> 51:04.216
Stay away from me

51:04.428 --> 51:05.861
Don't you come closer

51:06.063 --> 51:07.325
What the fuck,
what the fuck are you doing?

51:07.531 --> 51:08.361
Fuck, what you doing

51:08.565 --> 51:09.998
Seal it

51:10.200 --> 51:11.292
Seal his mouth

51:11.501 --> 51:13.731
Fuck, don't fuck with me

51:15.472 --> 51:18.532
What the fuck

51:27.884 --> 51:28.851
Seal the eyes

51:31.088 --> 51:32.020
This is enough

51:38.862 --> 51:40.159
Dragon, Dragon

51:40.363 --> 51:41.728
Fuck, let go of me

51:41.932 --> 51:42.626
Let go of me

51:42.833 --> 51:44.562
He fucked my woman,
don't you know that?

51:44.768 --> 51:45.666
He fucked my Hui

51:45.869 --> 51:47.632
Yeah, I know

52:01.952 --> 52:02.919
I'll do it

52:44.027 --> 52:44.516
Hey

52:46.163 --> 52:47.095
No need to worry

52:47.864 --> 52:50.458
I'll take him to the doc I know he'll fix it

52:51.268 --> 52:52.098
lt'll be alright

53:24.501 --> 53:26.799
Thank you, see you again

53:27.003 --> 53:27.935
Thanks

53:28.138 --> 53:30.470
Auntie, I want Ning

53:30.674 --> 53:32.403
Ning is with a customer at the moment

53:32.609 --> 53:34.167
I'll get you a prettier one

53:34.377 --> 53:36.311
Hey A-mei

53:37.881 --> 53:38.905
It's ok, I'll wait

53:39.416 --> 53:40.508
So faithful

53:40.717 --> 53:44.710
Handsome, come in, don't go away

53:59.569 --> 54:00.593
Come again soon

54:24.894 --> 54:25.918
Who did this?

54:26.429 --> 54:27.623
If I collect less than 30 cards

54:27.831 --> 54:29.526
One whip for one card short

54:47.751 --> 54:48.775
Sorry

54:51.421 --> 54:52.513
What you sorry for

54:53.723 --> 54:55.714
You didn't turn me into this

55:03.266 --> 55:04.790
What's up with you?

55:18.181 --> 55:19.648
Can I spend the night here?

55:24.020 --> 55:26.079
How many more do you need?
I'll buy them all

56:19.976 --> 56:20.738
I bought a lot

56:21.177 --> 56:22.542
Even one for Dog Boy

56:26.383 --> 56:27.975
Sorry, I forgot that he can't eat

56:28.651 --> 56:30.516
How could this happen?

56:31.621 --> 56:33.555
Didn't you say it's no problem?

56:37.794 --> 56:39.318
Could be too much in the nose

57:36.252 --> 57:37.048
Oi

57:38.421 --> 57:39.547
Where is it?

57:40.557 --> 57:41.581
What?

57:41.791 --> 57:42.985
The yo-yo

58:21.364 --> 58:25.323
The five of you, try to fly

58:25.535 --> 58:27.503
when you still don't know how to walk?

58:27.704 --> 58:30.002
Blackie and I only went to the South
for a couple of days

58:30.206 --> 58:33.198
You already made such a big mess

58:33.409 --> 58:35.604
When the day comes that I'm gone

58:35.812 --> 58:38.178
Would that mean
the end of Temple Front?

58:39.115 --> 58:41.140
The Prince Gang my ass

58:41.351 --> 58:44.479
Lost your mind for a Mainlander chick

58:44.687 --> 58:48.054
Dragon Lee,
you really think you're a prince?

58:48.258 --> 58:51.022
man's life is worth nothing for you?

58:57.133 --> 58:59.897
You can kill
when you can't even kneel properly?

59:00.103 --> 59:02.435
Look, if you fall again

59:02.639 --> 59:03.833
I'll beat you to death

59:04.040 --> 59:06.565
I'll be your page boy if I don't

59:08.177 --> 59:11.578
Boss, I made this mess

59:11.781 --> 59:13.544
It's got nothing to do with them

59:13.750 --> 59:15.081
It's all my fault

59:18.288 --> 59:19.448
Fine, get up

59:19.989 --> 59:21.149
All of you, get up

59:23.393 --> 59:24.451
All get up!

59:38.541 --> 59:40.304
You are good

59:40.510 --> 59:42.307
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me

59:42.512 --> 59:44.571
It's your fault

59:44.781 --> 59:47.249
It has nothing to do with them

59:47.450 --> 59:48.610
You are good

59:48.818 --> 59:49.978
You are good

59:50.186 --> 59:51.084
How come you're so good?

59:51.287 --> 59:51.844
So good

59:52.055 --> 59:53.022
You are really good

59:53.222 --> 59:54.917
Really good

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.072
Dad

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.344
You

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.389
Heading back?

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:11.423
Uh-huh

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:12.858
Boss Masa

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.461
Boss Masa

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.831
He almost wasted him. God forbid

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:29.170
He meant to kill him or what?

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:32.814
When kids make a mistake,
they should be disciplined

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.848
You haven't changed a bit, so naive

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.247
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.714
Sigh...

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.783
We're brothers for so many years

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.586
We're like family

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.960
Family? If only he felt the same way, too

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.759
Secretly hired someone

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.733
to chop off your hand,
and took your place

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:59.169
And now, he fucked up your son
when he got the chance

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:02.935
Don't talk about this in front of the kid

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.114
Come, come outside

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.965
Hey, why aren't you sleeping?
What's going on?

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.296
What he just said, is it true?

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.049
Chou Ling-Wan, your registered mail

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:44.912
Oh

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.749
Be right back

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.068
I'm takin' off

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.570
Got enough money with you?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.542
Yeah

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:12.844
Careful

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.016
I will

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:18.883
Sorry about that

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:19.611
No worries

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:22.347
Your son is very good-looking, going out?

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.820
Yeah

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.323
Pre-graduation trip

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.995
He's graduating?

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.629
You are really lucky

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.695
You're too kind

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:31.966
"1987"

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:37.299
"Together,
We Stepped into the World of Grown-ups
And There Was No Turning Back"

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.288
Sweeping Blade

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.658
Stabbing tube

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:04.662
Samurai 8-feet

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:05.561
Samurai 2-feet

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.427
Edged stiletto

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.967
Whenever you have time,

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:11.036
take them out, feel them and clean them

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.208
Befriend them

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:14.899
When you are in trouble

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.510
Your friends will support you

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:17.838
Get it?

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:28.383
Hurry up, you're falling behind

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.660
Son of a bitch, fuck

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:38.823
One, two, three

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.301
That's how it's done

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:51.696
Hey, I just took a piss

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.337
What age is it?

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.245
They all use guns now

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:52.011
What's the point of practicing these?

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.085
Come on, when the guns are loaded

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:56.122
Do we have the time to turn around
and get our 2-feet, 8-feet?

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.350
Our asses are already getting shot at

01:09:58.561 --> 01:09:59.994
What the fuck did you say?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:00.958
Boss Geta

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.061
Dad

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.755
Boss

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.765
Guns are evil things imported
from the West

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.801
They are for those who don't have balls

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:13.202
Weapon for the lowly

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.639
To establish oneself
in the underground society

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.813
One depends on his fists and knives

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.941
I won't let the five of you
lay your hands on guns

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.379
You hear me?

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:25.976
Hear me?

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.120
Yes

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:30.823
Let's go

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.297
Take your shit and let's go

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.022
Yay! The training camp is over!

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.896
Black Dog Bro on the mountain top

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:44.732
He is the young master of the ranch

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.034
Hard working night and day

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:52.044
His huge ranch takes up
the whole mountain

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.183
His singing is loud and cheerful

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:59.320
He sings non-stop all day long

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.490
His songs are so beautiful

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:06.024
His nice singing voice got him famous

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:09.755
I hear his voice but can't see him,
yo le yi li

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:13.366
Throughout the whole mountain
there is his voice, yo le yi li

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:16.936
The voice is pure and lovely, yo le yi li

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:20.939
Yo le yi, yo le yi li

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:23.835
Thank you

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.775
Applause please

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.978
Boss, what an incredible night

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.553
Both bosses of Monga Temple Front

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.691
and Back Alley are here

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:37.551
Masa is here?

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.920
Yeah

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.755
Good, I'll go have a drink with him later

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.123
Sure, sure

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.025
Hey

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.995
aren't the Back Alley guys our enemies?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.132
Of course

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:49.600
Then why Boss Geta said he'd go drink
with the boss of Back Alley?

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.432
Oh, they are buddies

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.436
They are buddies?

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:53.869
Uh-huh

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.067
They were sworn brothers

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:57.643
Like the five of us

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:00.406
One day you'll get your own block,
I'll have mine

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.140
Our subordinates fight
when they see each other

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.911
But for us on the top, when we meet

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.644
having a drink is a must

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:09.749
You'd better watch out

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.289
I'm not scared of you

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:19.467
If you don't tell what's on your mind

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:24.367
Who will ever know?

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:31.902
Sometimes I really want to

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:38.053
Just let out all of my sorrow

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:44.089
Stepped into the underground

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:50.232
I shouldn't have

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:56.393
Now that I want to undo my mistakes

01:12:56.605 --> 01:13:02.566
Who would understand?

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:08.648
My love if you know my heart...

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.292
Hey, homeboy, what a coincidence

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.762
I was about to go have a drink with you

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.161
Who you with?

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:29.462
Wim-Kian, he just got out

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.696
Came to welcome him back

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.272
How long was he in there?

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:34.703
House Cleaning Operation,
it's been three years

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.140
Three years already

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.280
He brought a Mainlander with him

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.881
Said the Mainlander
took care of him in there

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.711
Brought him to introduce to us

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.210
Lately I heard those Mainlanders

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.880
want a piece of Monga

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:55.359
Oh, gimme a break, don't think too much

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:58.533
I can't even speak "Mandorin"

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.862
With them,
there is nothing we can talk about

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:08.042
Hey homeboy, I'm thinking, seriously

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.871
Couple of events happened
to Wim-Kian's household

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:14.412
If you can, would you come and say hello?

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:17.847
His uncle cheated in games,
I handled it by the book

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:20.613
His cousin raped a woman

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.381
I sorted it out for him, too

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.219
The street, and business, the rules,
I did everything right

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.485
Why should I apologize

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.890
to a youngster for things like these?

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.962
Nah, you know it

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:34.158
Wim-Kian is like a mad dog

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.427
I don't care what kind of dog he is

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.901
It's your dog, train it yourself

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.948
Geta, nowadays the Grey Wolf's gang

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.454
is doing very well

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.559
Boss Masa, please stop teasing me

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.959
Did I say it wrong?

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.058
Dragon, make a toast

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.230
Boss Geta's son

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.302
My son

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.303
Dragon, handsome fellow

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:13.566
Bro. Grey Wolf

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:20.540
Grey Wolf, he's the most promising among

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.273
the younger generation in Monga

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:23.815
We should watch our back

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.509
or soon we'll be history

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:29.055
Boss Geta, look

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:31.956
For the past 3 years when I was in there

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.787
thanks for taking care of our boss

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.861
And people in my household

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.292
One day I, Wim-Kian

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.023
will do my best to repay you

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:43.169
Now that you're out, you should be happy

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:46.307
Saying all this nonsense is useless

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.442
Alright, come on, drink up

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.804
Here, everyone, cheers

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.445
Cheers, everyone, drink up

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.045
Cheers

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.578
Wim-Kian

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:06.324
How's your boss doing overseas?

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.456
He's in good shape physically,
but he's kind of depressed

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.634
It's hard not to get depressed

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.097
Mainlanders are indeed different

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.332
That Grey Wolf,
he moves a finger and the cigarette comes

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.271
The glass gets refilled
as soon as it got empty

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.138
It's like they were telepathic

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.007
And the whole group

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:27.806
stood still in the back all night long

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:29.176
Tall and straight like the Military Police

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.079
My legs got sore by just looking at them

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.311
Sigh, Monga is hopeless

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.216
So maybe you should

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:35.822
join them if you like them so much

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:36.888
You shitting me?

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.684
They just look more impressive

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:41.419
Wouldn't we look cool if we act like them?

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.325
I think they look phony

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.228
Yeah, bunch of fakes

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.602
You know that Grey Wolf?

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.931
You know him personally?

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:54.802
No, my mom does

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.836
Your mom's sleeping with him?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.474
Fuck, shut your face

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.478
Ah-ha, something fishy here

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.086
If your mom doesn't want him

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.016
give him to my mom. He is her type.

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:08.280
Shut up

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.159
Is it good?

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.161
Hmm, it's good

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:21.264
Then I'll bring some more next time

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.368
OK

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.438
Did you have a tough time
in the mountains?

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.316
What's up with you?

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.249
You look not yourself today

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.555
I ran into someone I don't like

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:50.628
Who was it?

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.862
My mom's ex, before she married my dad

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.732
My mom said she'd been
with him since she was 16

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.377
But one day

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:06.274
He left without a word

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:09.849
And disappeared until a few years ago

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.884
Are you gonna disappear
like him someday?

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.561
You're scared that I'll disappear?

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.601
Silly

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.337
Why call me silly

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.408
I won't

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.374
What did you say?

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.379
Something nice that
I'm not gonna say again

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:28.654
Hey boss, a barbequed chicken leg

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:30.855
OK, OK, right away

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:38.635
I'll get one more then

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.670
OK OK

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.319
Boss, have a chicken leg

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.185
Oh

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:00.453
Come, sit here

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:10.804
You grew up without a father?

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:15.466
That obvious?

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:24.141
Leave us;
kids shouldn't listen to adults' discussion

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:24.875
OK

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.248
Boss Masa

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.193
I heard you've been working

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.330
with the Mainlanders,
why didn't you tell me?

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.260
Who is talking such nonsense?

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.132
Words spread fast

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.808
Gimme a break

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.340
I can't even speak Mandarin

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.808
how do I work with the Mainlanders?

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:54.811
You really buy that shit?

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.582
Seriously, no?

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:04.891
They did talk to me about it

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:08.460
But I haven't agreed

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:11.928
That means yes then,
and you're still playin' dumb with me?

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:16.033
I've told Wim-Kian about this

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.433
If Boss Geta doesn't agree

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.608
then I won't do it

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.970
Our Monga is an old town

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:30.374
We have our own way
and traditions in managing this place

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.746
We don't want to work with outsiders

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:36.353
Masa and I are no exception

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.589
I understand

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.404
How about this?

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.972
In the beginning I won't show up

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:57.110
And you two bosses
still handle everything

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.405
We can observe each other for a while

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:01.639
Until we've reached certain level of
understanding and trust

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.249
Then we'll go from there

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.180
Moreover

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:07.287
The business I run outside of Monga

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.957
If you are interested, please let me know

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.819
I would love to have you join me

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.359
Thanks a lot

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.395
I think we better stay in Monga

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.123
with our small business

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.996
We don't know much
about the outside world

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.228
We are not interested in running around

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.116
What about Boss Masa,
what do you think?

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.383
My position is very simple

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.283
Whatever Boss Geta says

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.685
I do my best to follow suit

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:53.290
Yeah, you are the shit now

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:57.062
Dozens of block bosses,
with losts of grease to go around

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.864
And then

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.042
Fucking old asses getting in your way

01:23:01.242 --> 01:23:01.606
Look at your bosses:

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.040
drink all day, the women, a great life

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:07.009
Eventually, they will suck Monga dry

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:09.274
It's such a wonderful land, what a waste

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.022
Look at our Big Boss

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.921
He's got brains

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:23.393
He doesn't sleep,
he spends his days thinking

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.930
Thinking about how
to develop the organization

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.967
Now, as soon as he gives an order,
it'll be like cell division

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:32.730
We'll no longer be just a gang of hundreds

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:35.171
But tens of thousands, I am telling you

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.368
Guns will be brought in by sea in boxes

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.604
Halls will be established one after another

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:40.803
And you

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.279
Hanging out on your block

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:46.477
Selling toilet paper and selected tea,
collecting fees

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.713
Getting turned in every now and then

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:51.585
Times are changing, bro

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.988
Do it right

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.664
We set up a hall in Monga,
and you'll be the Boss

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.497
Each of us needs our own stage

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:04.463
The world is going to be ours

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:18.118
It's gonna be difficult
if there's only one hall for the entire Monga

01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:21.383
The two major powers in Monga

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:23.614
Are our Back Alley and the Temple Front

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.123
We've got our own blocks on each side

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.855
You won't have any problem with me

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.429
But if you wanna make this work

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:33.362
You'll have to include the Temple Front

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.798
Otherwise you'll have to
deal with all the blocks behind them

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.097
It won't be easy

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:39.639
It's gonna be a tough fight

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.739
You got someone from the Temple Front?

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.930
I still remember four years ago, right here

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.231
You were against over a dozen
from Da Dao Cheng

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.640
I saw them beating the life out of you

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.701
Still you wouldn't give in

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.677
I owe you for that

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.440
No need to thank me

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.379
It was because you've got balls

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.445
If you weren't tough enough

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:31.420
Even if you got beaten to death
in front of me 100 times

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.457
I wouldn't give a shit

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:38.955
Really, I owe you a lot

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.599
And that thing about the Dog Boy

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.431
I am fully aware

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.611
Dragon messed with
somebody's girlfriend four years ago

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.909
But you took on the heat

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:01.980
Can we spare Dragon?

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:10.787
What? You want to protect your brother?

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.329
Look

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:15.969
I am afraid that
we are losing the entire Monga

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:16.967
you know that?

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.668
It's like the last years of Ching Dynasty

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.365
All the foreign powers
have surrounded China with

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.636
their firearms, canons and ships

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:28.948
That old empress Tz'u-Hsi still thought
she could bring them all down

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:33.186
That's exactly what's happening in Monga

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:37.890
Our Boss Masa

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:40.925
puts on fancy clothes
and fools around everyday

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:44.961
And your Boss Geta is a stubbern old fool

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.627
The future is knocking on the door,
and Monga is still asleep

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.665
They all call me mad dog

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.300
They are right

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.675
But I had been thinking a lot
during the 3 years in prison

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:08.477
My boss turned me in
during the Big Crackdown

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.924
That Dragon, you took on the beating

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.593
every time he screwed up

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.596
That's the kind of fate for people like us

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:26.338
Now the Mainlanders are asking nicely
to do business with us

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:30.042
The proud old folks
refused right on the spot

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.041
When the time comes,
who's put on the frontline?

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.516
No one else but you and me

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:40.585
It's guns in their hands

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.884
You really think you can
fight them with a stabbing tube?

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:47.151
Don't feel ashamed
to work with the outsiders

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.561
You really think I'll let

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.856
the Mainlanders take over Monga?

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.301
Look who's thinking for Monga

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:57.837
Shoot, talking is useless

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:06.444
Holy crap, all that wind, and now the rain

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.111
Is the typhoon really coming?

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:18.618
Boss Masa have a good night, come again

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:22.694
And you, don't run around, be good

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.105
Ah, you came for Auntie Ai as well?

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:45.148
Boss

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.215
Boss Geta is here
with all of his Temple Front

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.151
brothers, to pay their respect

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:52.258
Please bless them, so that they are safe,
healthy and prosperous

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:04.071
Homeboy, rest in peace

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.565
I swear right here, on my name

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.973
That I will find the murderer

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.611
To do your vengeance

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:20.386
My condolence, take care

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:33.297
Boss Geta

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:36.500
I have mobilized everyone
in the Back Alley

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:39.673
I've also notified Taoyuan,
Chungli and the South

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.068
Boss, if you can help us find him

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.936
I'd very much appreciate

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:44.839
We have to get A-Chung

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.538
I want him kneel in front of our boss,
and pay back with his life

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.512
I'll help you find A-Chung

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:55.522
But we don't need to kill him

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:59.454
I'll find out if he's the murderer

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.924
Who knows? Maybe it's your own man

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.325
who did this, then frame him

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.233
Boss, how can you say this?

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:09.095
Are you saying that

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.498
our men killed our own boss?

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:14.573
Fuck, I'd say someone
from you Temple Front killed him

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.605
Don't move!

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:25.408
God is watching, we all know what we did

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:49.270
Boss, got news from the Back Alley

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.967
They said A-Chung
is spotted nearby the Watergate

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:53.807
Now they and the Da Dao Cheng
people are all out to get him

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.383
Boss

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.079
I heard A-Chung is around Watergate

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.016
Everyone, go get him now

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.212
OK let's go

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:12.900
You go with them

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:13.828
Boss, what about you?

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:16.196
There's nothing to worry about,
I'm on my own turf

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.701
Go, hurry

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.113
Boss, you're closing

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:28.509
Yeah

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:33.244
Everybody's out to get A-Chung,
not much business around here

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:37.255
All of the Temple Front went?

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:39.858
Your Boss Geta, I think he stayed

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.967
Then please make two for me

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.601
Please

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:49.735
OK

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:05.542
Sorry, come early tomorrow

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:08.813
We came all the way from the South,
can we just do a brief prayer?

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:09.990
Oh

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:04.903
Boss, boss

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:06.164
Anybody?

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.239
Anybody here?

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.171
Call the ambulance

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:12.278
Hurry call the ambulance

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.815
Boss

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:30.157
Somebody?

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.434
Call the ambulance

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.274
Anybody here?

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.190
Boss Dragon is gone

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:13.571
I told Dragon not to come today

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:16.470
If Dragon shows up today, he will die

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:19.305
Those bastards want our Dragon dead

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:20.309
They want us dead

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.311
they want us at the Temple Front all dead

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.416
Can't you see what's happening?

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:26.947
I'll go find him

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:28.346
You stay right here

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.488
I don't want him back,
I don't want him here

01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:31.317
Don't you go get him

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:32.992
our Geta will understand

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.389
Madam, madam, calm down, have a seat

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:39.532
I don't want him back

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.998
don't bring him back

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:09.585
Who is it?

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.621
It's me, me

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:14.856
It's OK now

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.243
It's me

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:47.422
It's time, can't wait anymore

01:37:48.929 --> 01:37:50.624
Who will hold the memorial tablet then?

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:55.200
I'll do it

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:33.306
Geta or Masa, take your pick

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:39.542
Geta

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.281
Goddamn sons of bitches

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:48.250
How dare you, getting all despicable
in front of Master God

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:51.252
You two go from the back door

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.255
Go now

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.987
If you don't kill them today

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:08.286
One day they'll kill you

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.364
I want them to pay with their blood

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.396
Why are you pushing me?

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.166
Motherfucker

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:29.272
You think we're their match?

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:30.945
How on Earth do you think
we can do anything about it?

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:33.312
Boss Geta is dead, Boss Masa is dead too

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.412
Aren't you humans?

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:35.919
Don't you have any feelings?

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:38.023
Do you even have feelings?

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:39.487
Don't you be stirring things up

01:41:39.626 --> 01:41:41.184
How do we revenge
without knowing who did it?

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:43.591
It's Wim-Kian, must be him

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:46.255
Everybody knows it,
but no one dares to touch him

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.559
Motherfucker

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.497
No! Stop it!

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:50.733
Monk

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:55.200
Stop it, Monk

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:57.308
Stop it

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:10.850
At this point, revenge is suicide

01:42:17.698 --> 01:42:19.962
Besides, Dragon can't stay in Monga

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.505
You three

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:30.336
take Dragon to the Philippines,
lay low for a while

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.544
I'll stay and investigate

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.510
We need evidence

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:39.713
I'll stay too

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:59.566
Do you remember,
the night Boss Geta died

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:02.675
You were all sent to find that A-Chung

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.075
Have you ever thought

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.145
it could just be a smoke bomb?

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:33.095
A-Shing

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:35.441
The thing, I want it done tomorrow

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.803
OK, no problem, leave it to me

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:40.309
Get some rest Boss, I'm heading off

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:07.101
Monkey is involved in an armed assault

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.399
Now the police suspects that

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:09.371
the gun in his possesion

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:11.669
is the same one that killed

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:13.072
the Back Alley boss

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.907
You pathetic liars

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:18.175
My Monkey is still at school

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:20.148
What did you take me here for?

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:21.514
I gotta hurry home

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.383
and cook for him

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.992
Fuck your sorry ass

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.465
Dragon, don't do that

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:11.899
Let's go

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:15.472
Ignore 'em

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:21.373
Why are they like this?

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.711
Because Monkey killed Boss Masa

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:27.949
Apparently Boss Geta
ordered Monkey to do it

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:30.648
so he could take over the Back Alley

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:32.984
Then they in turn killed
Boss Geta and Blackie

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.358
Temple Front did something like this

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:37.621
The gang has lost people's respect

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:39.298
What are you talking about?

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:42.431
Monkey didn't kill Boss Masa

01:45:47.874 --> 01:45:49.432
Then you go explain to everybody

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:51.508
What is the reason that made

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:53.612
Monkey become the scapegoat?

01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:15.335
Something to drink?

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:17.162
I am just here to ask you a question

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:18.599
Then I'm out of here

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:21.898
Have a seat

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:33.145
Hey you guys take a break,
Grey Wolf Bro. has a meeting

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:48.792
Why did you leave my mom
in the first place?

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:52.264
Something went wrong

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:53.897
Had to get away

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:56.737
Then why didn't you explain to her?

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.170
Because then she would
have waited for me

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:05.108
Didn't want her to waste her youth waiting

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:11.056
Then, if you were given a second chance

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.987
Would you stay with her?

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:18.187
We only live once

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:21.499
I've run out of my chances

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:22.668
Yes

01:47:24.704 --> 01:47:26.262
You still have a chance

01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:30.376
If something happens to me,
please take good care of her

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:32.942
What are you talking about?

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:36.276
I'm warning you

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:39.111
Your mom went through hell to raise you

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.650
You owe her your life

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.687
You get me?

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:45.119
But Boss Geta died in my arms

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:49.354
I can never forget how he died in my arms

01:48:02.409 --> 01:48:03.273
You know what?

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:07.036
Whichever way the wind blows

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.579
The grass bends along

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:17.717
When I was young
I thought I was the wind

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.820
But eventually it cost me dearly

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:29.126
Then I realized we're all just grass

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.677
You are still young, you've got options

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:51.389
Go to the Philippines
and lay low for a while

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.760
What's gonna happen in Monga
nobody knows

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:30.659
I need to speak to Monk

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:35.263
I've made up my mind,
I'll go to the Philippines too

01:49:46.212 --> 01:49:48.305
I'll be in the Philippines
for a couple months

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:54.452
You haven't served in the military,
how do you get out of the country?

01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:00.725
Unregistered boat

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.269
I will be back soon

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:22.911
I've asked Auntie how much you owe her

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.011
I'll figure out a way to get that money

01:50:31.324 --> 01:50:32.621
When I come back

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:36.656
I'll get you out of here

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.671
I'll take you to the movies some time

01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:51.610
How's that possible

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:54.871
If I get caught, they'll break my legs

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:57.814
Auntie promised me, personally

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:01.618
She'll tell them
that you're going for abortion

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:03.107
Here

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:04.071
Cheers

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.411
Grey Wolf, that's it then, we're heading off

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:09.707
Sure

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:15.553
Scar, see them to the door

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:16.312
Yes, sir

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:17.717
That's it

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:19.688
There's no problem right?

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:20.757
Don't worry

01:53:36.075 --> 01:53:37.667
You need to do it nice and clean

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.844
Don't leave behind anything
that'd make us lose sleep

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:44.648
He already agreed to get on
the boat with them

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:47.615
And then,
what are we gonna do when he's back?

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:47.442
Mom, I left some savings in your closet

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:49.073
Why in my closet?

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:52.649
Deposit it in the bank,
and you can earn interest

01:54:56.155 --> 01:54:57.315
Then you do it for me

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:35.088
Boss Geta, excuse me,
please lend me your 2-feet

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:38.859
Bless me, and help me to find the truth

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:04.623
Boy, go get the car

01:56:50.303 --> 01:56:51.395
I'm leaving everything to you

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.170
OK, take care

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:03.013
Let's go yeah?

01:57:03.616 --> 01:57:04.480
Wait

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:08.613
Let's go pray to the Master God for a sec

01:57:12.325 --> 01:57:13.917
What you talking this shit to me for?

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:18.359
I'm afraid you won't be able to
explain to Sister Ling

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:21.359
Explain to whom?

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:25.034
I'm a goddamn gangster,
who am I answering to?

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:27.868
He's not my son for God's sake

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:40.714
Get the car; we're going to Monga

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.456
He's not here

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:51.095
Oh, earlier he told me
to deposit money for him

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:06.039
What's up with all this money?

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:14.142
All his regular clothes are gone

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:27.723
Why is the postcard I sent you

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:29.458
in Yi Mong's closet?

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.943
How could you keep me
in the dark for so many years?

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:37.230
Shut the door, go shut the door

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:41.096
What are you doing?

01:59:41.307 --> 01:59:42.103
Yeah, Mosquito, what you doing?

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.505
Stay where you are

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:47.374
I want to know something

01:59:48.247 --> 01:59:49.544
Tell us

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:50.875
Are you sending us to the boat

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.573
or to Hell?

01:59:53.619 --> 01:59:54.244
What the fuck?

01:59:54.453 --> 01:59:55.647
There is no boat, right?

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:56.913
Mosquito, can you put down the knife first?

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.954
If there's a misunderstanding,
we can sort it out

01:59:59.158 --> 02:00:00.591
There's no misunderstanding

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.253
Listen

02:00:03.462 --> 02:00:05.623
Tonight, there is no boat but trap

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:09.064
Thre's no way we're
getting to the Philippines

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:11.100
Monk

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:12.737
Explain, what's going on?

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.133
What's the deal?

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.637
Why did Mosquito say something like that?

02:00:15.841 --> 02:00:16.808
What's the situation?

02:00:17.009 --> 02:00:18.101
Mosquito, have you lost your mind?

02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:19.744
Say it!

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:29.313
We swore to be brothers,
at the very same place

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:32.822
And now one of you's
putting a knife against my neck

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:35.050
Another one is starting to doubt me

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:37.159
What the fuck is this?

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:40.298
If you've go the fucking guts,
tell the truth in front of the Master God

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:42.129
If I misunderstood you

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:43.859
feel free to give me a stab

02:00:45.137 --> 02:00:46.900
But if you are the traitor
who sold out the Temple Front

02:00:47.106 --> 02:00:48.630
I want you to pay with your life

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:49.899
Sell out?

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.810
How could that be Monk?

02:00:53.012 --> 02:00:54.070
Can you please stop this shit? OK?

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.975
Stop acting like this

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.412
I saw him with Wim-Kian

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.482
and Grey Wolf, with my own eyes

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:11.355
Your mama

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:15.866
Not my day

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:27.574
Times are changing

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:31.046
The outside world is changing

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:34.218
If we are as stubborn as the old bosses

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.149
we'll be dead sooner or later

02:01:36.355 --> 02:01:38.550
The entire Monga will fall into their hands

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:42.124
I met with Grey Wolf and Wim-Kian,
was to save Monga

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:43.226
To save

02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:46.553
The Temple Front

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.828
So, did you kill my dad?

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:55.063
You're the one who killed my dad?

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:04.480
Kill them

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:08.310
Motherfuckers

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:02.040
Everything I do

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:06.716
is for you

02:07:42.955 --> 02:07:43.944
Have you seen Mosquito?

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:29.129
Go get everybody

02:08:29.334 --> 02:08:30.824
Should we go take a look?

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.380
If you got on the boat,
then we wouldn't end up like this

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:19.506
Why didn't you just get on the boat?

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:21.980
Why are you making me do this?

02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:05.022
Go ahead and kill me

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:08.192
If you don't kill me today

02:10:09.568 --> 02:10:11.559
I will kill you tomorrow

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:14.735
I never understood

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:17.465
what's the point in all this fighting

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:21.744
Now I am even more confused

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:23.141
You're my brother

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.441
but I have to kill you

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:29.945
Because this is the street

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:33.684
Because we're gangsters

02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:37.188
Whoever gets in the way dies

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:40.760
There's no other choice

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:44.258
If this were the way of the street

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:50.233
Then I am not a gangster

02:10:51.844 --> 02:10:53.778
I am in this for friendship

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.845
I am in this for brotherhood

02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:17.193
Guns are weapons for the lowly

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:35.809
Monk

02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:40.016
You thought I was going to embrace you

02:11:40.893 --> 02:11:42.884
So you opened your arms

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:45.696
At that moment

02:11:46.031 --> 02:11:48.932
You chose to believe in me, didn't you?

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:52.893
You thought you were in this as a gangster

02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:58.673
But like me, you're here for friendship
and brotherhood, too

02:12:07.686 --> 02:12:10.917
You thought Geta was a decent man?

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:14.759
He wanted to become the Boss

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.690
So he chopped off my dad's arm

02:12:19.998 --> 02:12:23.229
Did you know how he treated his brothers?

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:58.559
What's good in the cinema lately?

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:01.232
Dumb Recruit is pretty funny

02:13:02.174 --> 02:13:03.141
Really

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:21.585
Mosquito, are you OK?

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:29.150
Dragon, Dragon

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:31.585
Hurry, let's go

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.394
Dragon

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:03.124
Look, something happened

02:15:03.328 --> 02:15:05.819
Go look for some guy called Mosquito

02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:33.983
Where's my ear?

02:15:53.378 --> 02:15:54.242
Some say

02:15:54.846 --> 02:15:58.407
Joining the gang is like getting a bad lot

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:00.509
You end up either living in exile

02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:02.550
Or getting brutally murdered on the streets

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:07.216
But that year, me and my brothers

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:09.555
we all believed joining the gang

02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:11.058
using violence to gain control

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:12.696
was the way to rule

02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:17.395
The only way for survival

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:27.203
Why do the four of you want to recruit me?

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:32.443
Because it takes five fingers

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.174
to form a fist

02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:04.181
"Monga,
in Ketagalan (aboriginal tribe lived in Taipei)
dialect, means canoe.
