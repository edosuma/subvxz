<i>Max!</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:27.398
Come on!

02:27.565 --> 02:30.234
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.

02:35.031 --> 02:37.408
<i>This is Frey.</i>

02:38.409 --> 02:41.454
<i>She's new here as well.</i>

02:46.751 --> 02:48.127
<i>Can you read?</i>

02:53.925 --> 02:56.928
It's a giraffe. They were from Africa.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.263
- You can read?
- Yes.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.149
<i>"There are many robot servants,
and they serve you all day.</i>

03:10.858 --> 03:14.445

you never get sick or old."

03:14.612 --> 03:17.615
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?

03:17.782 --> 03:19.117
Yeah, I promise.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.619
<i>Frey and...</i>

03:23.121 --> 03:24.872
...Max...

03:25.665 --> 03:27.333
<i>...forever.</i>

03:29.210 --> 03:32.380
<i>Max, have you been
stealing things again?</i>

03:34.465 --> 03:36.422
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

03:36.442 --> 03:38.720
Why do you do this?

03:39.637 --> 03:41.305
<i>So you can save up?</i>

03:41.472 --> 03:44.642
<i>One day buy a ticket up to that place?</i>

03:56.821 --> 04:00.283
<i>That place is not for you, or for me.</i>

04:01.492 --> 04:03.369
But it's not fair, Sister.

04:03.745 --> 04:05.163
Why can't I go there?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.331
<i>Sometimes in life
we don't understand...</i>

04:07.498 --> 04:10.001
...why things are the way they are.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.463
<i>But I know one thing.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:16.173
<i>I know you are special.</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:20.344
You will do something
very important one day.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.805
<i>Something you were born for.</i>

04:24.974 --> 04:26.184
<i>My little Max.</i>

05:10.812 --> 05:14.941
Off to work, huh?
Gotta get up early to work that line.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.235
Make the world a better place.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.821
That's real funny, I have a job.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.453
Come on. You think I got money?
Do I look like I have money?

05:27.620 --> 05:29.664
Come on.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.749
How about you?
You got a little money?

05:31.916 --> 05:34.919
Come on. What have you got in there?
What have you got?

05:35.086 --> 05:36.337
Oh, wait a minute.

05:36.838 --> 05:37.880
Wait a minute.

05:38.422 --> 05:43.177
Oh, it's 5 bucks. Hey, wait a minute,
I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.681
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.432
All right.

05:57.775 --> 06:02.113
<i>Please form an orderly queue.
Your bus has arrived.</i>

06:09.579 --> 06:11.330
Leave me alone!

06:11.622 --> 06:14.000
Checked. Move on.

06:14.292 --> 06:17.003
<i>Your bags may be searched.</i>

06:22.383 --> 06:23.843
Good morning, officer.

06:24.010 --> 06:29.140
Extensive criminal history.
Multiple felonies. What's in the bag?

06:29.891 --> 06:32.226
Hair products, mostly.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.645
I'm just fucking with-- Hey, hey, hey.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.231
I'm just going to work.
Nothing's in the fucking bag.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.482
Come on, I--

06:38.649 --> 06:40.651
Misdemeanor: citizen disobedience.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.154
I'm just going to work, man. Come on.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.329
- Checked.
- Nothing in there, is there?

06:51.495 --> 06:53.706
Zero tolerance policy
applies to all citizens.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.124
No shit.

06:55.291 --> 07:01.088
You must report immediately to
your parole officer. Thank you, citizen.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.506
No, thank you.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.355
- Frey, fracture, Bed 2.
- Just let us work, okay? Let us work.

07:22.777 --> 07:24.403
Max?

07:25.446 --> 07:28.449
Frey. I thought you were...

07:29.075 --> 07:30.368
When did you get back?

07:30.534 --> 07:33.037
Been back for a while.
I see things haven't changed.

07:33.204 --> 07:36.082
- No, this wasn't even my fault.
- Of course not.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.293
- Let me have a look. Pretty bad break.
- It isn't pleasant.

07:41.212 --> 07:43.047
So you're a nurse, huh? You did it.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.549
Yeah.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.094
That's great.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.554
You still stealing cars?

07:50.721 --> 07:54.058
No. God, no. I don't do any
of that stupid shit anymore.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.559
I work at Armadyne.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.438
- On the line, working my way up.
- They need you on the third floor.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.731
Be right there.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.900
So, you know, now that you're back--

08:03.067 --> 08:06.070
Just a second, Max. Two seconds.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.656
Dominica. Can you take over here?

08:08.823 --> 08:11.909
Hey, listen. Now, you know,
because you're back and everything--

08:12.076 --> 08:13.744
Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.163
It's good to see you.
Stay out of trouble.

08:18.374 --> 08:19.417
I do.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.548
<i>Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.</i>

08:25.715 --> 08:27.842
<i>Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.</i>

08:28.009 --> 08:31.262
- Out of the way, sir.
- Look, I get it.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.806
I know why you left the neighborhood.
I understand.

08:34.849 --> 08:39.687
If I was as smart as you, I would have
left too. Have dinner with me. Just...

08:40.104 --> 08:42.648
All right.
Look, I'll settle for a coffee.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.317
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.611
I gotta break my other arm
to get attention?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.613
- Stop. Stop.
- Because I will do that.

08:51.032 --> 08:52.867
My life is complicated, Max.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.996
I just-- I-- I-- I miss you.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.209
- My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay?
- Yeah. All right.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.336
- Coffee.
- Yeah, coffee. Right.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.672
Get out of here.

09:07.882 --> 09:11.719
<i>All parolees must pass weapons inspection.</i>

09:18.059 --> 09:19.226
Hello.

09:20.311 --> 09:21.812
I'd just like to explain--

09:21.979 --> 09:26.192
Max Da Costa. Violation of Penal Code
2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.652
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted
to talk about.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.488
See, there was a misunderstanding.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.782
Immediate extension of parole
by eight months.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.826
Wait, what? No, no, no.
I can explain what happened.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.995
I just made a joke, and, you know--

09:38.162 --> 09:42.416
Stop talking. Police officers noted
violent and antisocial behavior.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.668
We regretfully must extend parole.

09:46.337 --> 09:49.548
Elevation in heart rate detected.
Would you like a pill?

09:49.715 --> 09:53.219
No. Thank you.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.304
- I'd like to explain-
- Stop talking.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.849
Personality matrix suggests
a 78.3 percent chance of regression...

09:59.016 --> 10:01.227
...to old behavior patterns:
Grand theft auto.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.562
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Resisting arrest.

10:04.105 --> 10:08.442
- Would you like to talk to a human?
- No, I am okay, thank you.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.361
Are you being sarcastic and/or abusive?

10:10.528 --> 10:11.695
Negative.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.323
It is a federal offense
to abuse a parole officer.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.491
Understood.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.122
<i>Safety is our priority.</i>

10:21.622 --> 10:24.375
<i>- Hey. Da Costa.
- No weapons detected.</i>

10:24.542 --> 10:26.710
- You're late for your shift.
- I had a thing--

10:26.877 --> 10:29.046
No, you can't work with that.
You're out.

10:29.213 --> 10:33.050
No, no, no. I'm good, man. I can work.
This comes off today. I'm fine.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.385
- You're good?
- I'm good.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.470
Okay. I'm docking you half a day.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.223
- Yeah, all right.
- You're lucky to have this job.

10:39.390 --> 10:42.268
<i>No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.</i>

10:42.768 --> 10:47.231
<i>The restroom more than once per shift.
Please keep your workstation tidy.</i>

10:47.398 --> 10:50.943
<i>A tidy workstation
is an efficient workstation.</i>

11:03.831 --> 11:05.833
Check it out, man. I think he likes you.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.252
Think he got his face peel today?
He looks good.

11:08.419 --> 11:11.338
<i>Attention. All workers
must reach weekly quotas.</i>

11:11.505 --> 11:14.508
<i>Please report any unsafe activity
to your supervisor.</i>

11:14.717 --> 11:17.094
<i>If we don't have a clear path to upside...</i>

11:17.261 --> 11:20.514
<i>...our investors are going to start
losing a lot of confidence.</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:22.892
What do you think I've been doing
down on Earth?

11:23.058 --> 11:25.603
- You think I enjoy breathing this air?
- No, of course--

11:25.769 --> 11:29.940
I am doing everything possible
to restore profitability to this company.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.984
The company that I built.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.527
Now, if you will excuse me...

11:33.694 --> 11:36.530
...I have to not speak to you people
any longer. Thank you.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.460
Closing 34.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.673
Fire in 34.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.781
Burn her ID!

12:32.336 --> 12:34.338
Let's go. Let's go.
We don't have much time.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.674
We hacked three transponder codes, Spider.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.384
Okay. Pull them up on-screen.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.427
Codes have been accepted.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.013
Fire up the shuttles!

12:44.348 --> 12:45.975
We are going up!

13:19.216 --> 13:21.552
- Welcome.
- Hello, madam.

13:21.719 --> 13:24.054
- Take a look at the garden.
- We will. Thank you.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.390
Yes, I understand...

13:27.850 --> 13:30.311
My, how you've grown!

13:31.312 --> 13:32.813
Are the children here?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.315
Yes, with Dominica.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.859
I have a present for you.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.862
Go and get it with your mother.

13:40.029 --> 13:41.905
It's next to the couch.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.034
Ma'am, would you care for a refreshment?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.327
Command: Cancel.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.473
<i>Sorry for disturbing you, ma'am.</i>

14:07.639 --> 14:09.933
<i>We have a number of

14:14.521 --> 14:16.940
<i>Good afternoon,

14:17.483 --> 14:21.487
<i>Three undocumented ships

14:47.346 --> 14:50.224
<i>You are in violation of Elysium airspace.</i>

14:50.391 --> 14:52.059
The standard warning didn't work.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.438
Fifteen thousand kilometers and closing.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.691
- What do you want us to do, ma'am?
- Activate Kruger.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.237
Ma'am, according to Executive Order 355...

- The last missile was a miss.
- Ridiculous.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.692
Only one made it.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.864
The ship has breached our atmosphere.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.464
First undocumented ship just touched down.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.097
Don't worry about it.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.058

- No.
- What do you mean, no?

19:45.060 --> 19:48.271
- You didn't hear what I was gonna say.
- All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.566
Okay. You know the house of Los Zetas,
up on the hill?

19:51.733 --> 19:55.320
- Yeah, the one with all the guns.
- Yeah. They have five cars. New ones.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.448
It's gonna be three of us.
Tomorrow at lunch.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.076
- Lunch time. That's the plan?
- Yeah.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.286
- Jesus Christ.
- What? You have a better plan?

20:03.453 --> 20:07.374
Yeah. We just take one guy,
go before the sun comes up.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.961
You take the two fastest cars,
torch the batteries on the other one so-

20:11.128 --> 20:12.796
Fuck you, fuck you.

20:12.963 --> 20:16.591
I got you. Please, man, you're the best.
Give me one year.

- I'm not going back to prison.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.512
One year, please.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.906
Hey. You're holding up the line.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.908
No. No, no. I got a jam.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.369
<i>Attention. Workers may not visit
the restroom more than once per shift.</i>

21:26.536 --> 21:29.539
- What have you done, Da Costa?
- No, I'm just trying to reset.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.042
Let me look. Let me look.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.086
- The pallet's pinched.
- Yeah, it moved.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.464
- Just go in there.
- No. I mean...

21:37.631 --> 21:41.259
Look, either you go in there right now
or I'll find someone who will...

21:41.426 --> 21:43.678
- ...and you can clean out your locker.
- Come on.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.681
No. That's the deal, okay? In you go.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.896
Let's go, people. Back to work.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.483
Fuck.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.925
No, no. No, no, no!

22:22.092 --> 22:24.302
No. No, no! No, stop. No, no!

22:24.469 --> 22:25.720
Hey! Hey! Hey!

22:37.774 --> 22:38.942
Hey.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.324
Hey, come on, you guys.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.120
It's too late. It's too late, come on.

22:50.328 --> 22:51.663
Come on.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.040
Extraction!

23:23.153 --> 23:26.114
They started the fight, Sister.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.367
I just want to live there.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.205
You see how beautiful it looks to us
from here?

23:35.498 --> 23:37.000
Yes.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.170
Well...

23:40.503 --> 23:43.715
Now look how beautiful
we look from there.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.302
Keep it.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.846
This is yours now.

23:50.680 --> 23:54.351
To never forget about where you come from.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.703
What happened?

24:13.870 --> 24:17.374
You have been exposed
to a lethal dose of radiation.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.377
You will experience
catastrophic organ failure.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.463
In five days' time, you will die.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.768
What is going on?
Why has production stopped?

24:37.185 --> 24:40.355
- He's been exposed.
- Don't breathe on me. Cover your mouth.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.564
I'm sorry, sir.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.910
Does his skin fall off or something?

24:54.077 --> 24:56.496
I don't want to replace the bedding.
Get him out.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.082
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thank you.

24:59.249 --> 25:02.585
<i>Mr. Carlyle,
your shuttle is ready for departure.</i>

25:08.258 --> 25:11.553
Please sign this to receive medication.

25:19.436 --> 25:24.899
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you
functioning normally until your death.

25:25.066 --> 25:30.280
Please take one pill with each meal.
Thank you for your service.

25:41.499 --> 25:46.963
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down
two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.632
Your mandate is to deal
with illegals quietly.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.384
I am aware of that.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.636
And then there's the use of this...

25:54.304 --> 25:57.807
...agent, a Mr. M. Kruger.

25:57.974 --> 26:02.479
Fifteen human rights violations.
Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.648
The man's been diagnosed
with serious psychological issues.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.817
We made it explicitly clear to you...

26:07.984 --> 26:10.361
...that we are no longer using
sleeper agents.

26:10.528 --> 26:13.323
Tell me something, President Patel.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.742
Do you have children?

26:17.911 --> 26:19.662
I am not the one being reviewed here.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.374
Then I will assume you do not.

26:23.541 --> 26:28.296
Perhaps if you did have children,
then you would behave in a manner...

26:28.463 --> 26:32.217
...that is more conducive
to the longevity of this habitat.

26:32.383 --> 26:37.097
I understand that it is not the fashion
to think and to act as I do.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.016
I understand that perfectly.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.185
But when they come for your house...

26:42.393 --> 26:44.687
...for the house you built
for your children...

26:44.854 --> 26:46.856
...and your children's children...

26:47.023 --> 26:52.612
...it won't be PR and campaign promises
that keep them out. It will be me.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.532
I've heard enough.
This is your final warning.

26:55.698 --> 26:59.536
Any further unauthorized actions,
and you will be removed from office.

26:59.702 --> 27:03.957
And let's discharge
this Agent Kruger permanently.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.625
All in favor?

27:07.127 --> 27:09.045
Good. Effective immediately.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.859
You want some beer?

27:40.201 --> 27:42.745
<i>You have been discharged from CCB.</i>

27:42.912 --> 27:45.790
<i>Please return all weapons
to the local embassy.</i>

27:47.625 --> 27:50.587
Fuck your politics, man! Fuck you!

28:05.476 --> 28:07.061
Max.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.442
Max.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.488
What happened? Jesus.
Let me help you.

28:17.655 --> 28:18.865
Let's go in, come on.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.286
Max, what happened? Jesus.

28:23.453 --> 28:24.913
Max. What happened?

28:25.079 --> 28:27.665
- I shouldn't have gone in, man.
- Go in where?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.418
Jesus.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.466
I took a full dose, man.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.885
I got a full dose.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.264
You're gonna be okay. Let me help.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.517
You're gonna be okay, Max.

28:46.684 --> 28:49.896
They gave me Miporol, man.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.357
They gave me fucking...

28:53.691 --> 28:55.652
...Miporol.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.281
Five fucking days, man.
I only got five days.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.450
You have to take this.

29:04.744 --> 29:08.081
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.
- I know.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.041
I'm gonna go see Spider.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.169
Max. Max, take the pill.

29:18.091 --> 29:19.676
There you go.

29:20.677 --> 29:22.512
To see Spider, you need money.

29:23.846 --> 29:26.891
I'll give you everything I have,
but it's not enough for a ticket.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.520
He's gonna give me a ticket.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.856
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.612
<i>Frey, we've done everything we could
to help your daughter.</i>

29:40.405 --> 29:43.741
<i>I met with the board today and they
recommend we send her home with you.</i>

29:43.908 --> 29:46.202
How can I work here and leave her at home?

29:46.369 --> 29:48.454
It can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.

29:48.621 --> 29:52.041
I know. If she has another seizure,
of course bring her back to the ward.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.543
Of course.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.420
But until then, she's discharged.

29:55.795 --> 29:59.215
This isn't Elysium.
We can't just heal her.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.760
Max.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.137
It's been a while, my brother.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.473
How's life at the factory?

30:49.599 --> 30:51.309
I need to ask you a favor.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.353
What? I can't hear you. What?

30:54.312 --> 30:56.439
I need a ticket up there.

30:57.398 --> 31:00.276
- And an ID.
- Oh, yeah.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.821
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

31:04.781 --> 31:07.450
Absolutely.
Do you prefer aisle or window?

31:07.617 --> 31:11.037
I'm being fucking serious, man.

31:11.204 --> 31:14.499
Listen. I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back and work for you.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.629
Anything you need, man.
I'll fucking pay it back.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.297
You know what?

31:23.299 --> 31:26.552
This is priceless.

31:28.846 --> 31:32.058
This is priceless.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.644
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.

31:34.811 --> 31:39.273
Do you have any idea
how many idiots come in here...

31:39.440 --> 31:41.818
...saying the same kind of bullshit?

31:41.984 --> 31:45.530
I got little kids coming in here every day.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.116
Max, if I were you...

31:48.825 --> 31:51.160
...I'd get the fuck out of here right now.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.497
Max, don't. Hey, Max, don't.

31:54.664 --> 31:55.665
I did three years for you.

31:55.832 --> 31:58.334
After everything I did for you,
you'll get me up there.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.503
- Can you feel this?
- Go ahead and shoot.

32:00.670 --> 32:04.382
I got so much radiation in my body,
you're probably getting sick yourself.

32:04.549 --> 32:07.718
- You're really dying?
- I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

32:07.885 --> 32:12.056
See this? It's over. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!

32:12.223 --> 32:14.308
Put the gun down! Get out of here!

32:15.268 --> 32:16.853
Okay?

32:17.353 --> 32:21.065
Listen. I've been looking for someone
to take a job for me.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.027
But no one here had the balls!

32:26.028 --> 32:28.364
You said you'd do anything, right?

32:29.490 --> 32:30.533
Max.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.627
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.886
All right, here we go.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.309
This...

32:58.394 --> 32:59.896
...my friend...

33:00.563 --> 33:03.983
This can be your ticket up there.

33:06.694 --> 33:09.989
One last job for me,
you earn your way up.

33:11.115 --> 33:15.870
- What is it?
- Take an Elysian asshole, right?

33:16.037 --> 33:17.580
A billionaire.

33:17.747 --> 33:20.541
He's down on Earth for some business.

33:20.708 --> 33:23.669
He's here for whatever. We hijack him.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.588
- Fuck that.
- Okay, relax.

33:26.422 --> 33:29.091
It gets, like, much worse.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.678
Forget his watch. Forget his ride.
Forget all that shit.

33:32.845 --> 33:36.265
This is what you take.

33:38.351 --> 33:41.938
Organic information,
right out of his head.

33:42.355 --> 33:46.901
Now, I'm talking about bank codes,
passwords, log-in data.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.445
Access to billions.

33:50.363 --> 33:53.115
All you have to do
is plug into his brain...

33:53.282 --> 33:56.077
...download the data into yours
with this baby...

33:56.244 --> 33:58.204
...and bring it to me.

33:58.371 --> 33:59.705
This is crazy, Max. Come on.

33:59.872 --> 34:05.336
Once we verify the data, I'll give you
a one-way ride, all expenses paid.

34:05.503 --> 34:08.297
Even throw in some snacks and a drink.

34:08.464 --> 34:12.592
All you have to do is walk
into a house and use the med bay...

34:12.760 --> 34:13.803
...and you're cured.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.431
Sandro will do the surgery.
You know him?

34:17.598 --> 34:19.684
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.143
I'm good.

34:21.310 --> 34:26.399
Actually, you seem all weak and fucked up.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.652
So you know what? I'll have them...

34:30.820 --> 34:34.739
This is crazy. Let's get out of here,
please. Listen to me.

34:34.907 --> 34:37.868
- What the fuck am I gonna do?
- I'll have them install...

34:38.869 --> 34:42.123
...this. A third-generation exo-suit.

34:42.290 --> 34:46.335
We hook this into your nervous system,
it'll make you as strong as a droid.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.670
You're already under the knife, right?

34:48.838 --> 34:50.590
Let's get out of here. Please.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.009
I want a four-man team, but I pick them.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.844
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

34:56.012 --> 35:00.057
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough.
- Okay.

35:00.224 --> 35:03.769
But I'm taking Julio.
He gets a ticket up there, same as me.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.148
Yeah, sure.
Okay. I'll go get the boys ready.

35:07.732 --> 35:09.025
Wait.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.528
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

35:14.071 --> 35:17.283
<i>The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?</i>

35:18.534 --> 35:20.036
That's the mark.

35:25.625 --> 35:29.337
Secretary Delacourt,
Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

35:29.712 --> 35:34.925
You are here to persuade me
to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

35:35.092 --> 35:36.469
Astute as always.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.430
Come with me.

35:46.896 --> 35:49.815
I'm not interested in your little ideas.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.110
I'm interested in something much larger.

35:53.277 --> 35:55.613
This habitat is dying.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.240
There is a political sickness inside of it.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.160
A tumor that needs to be removed.

36:01.327 --> 36:04.830
You and your company
are in need of revenue...

36:04.997 --> 36:06.582
...that is drying up.

36:06.749 --> 36:10.252
So you built the torus.

36:10.753 --> 36:15.800
Can you override the servers
and place a new president in power?

36:18.928 --> 36:20.763
A coup?

36:21.847 --> 36:23.599
Are you suggesting a coup?

36:24.100 --> 36:25.976
Is it possible?

36:27.478 --> 36:31.732
I could write a reboot sequence
and shut down the entire system.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.609
And at that point...

36:34.860 --> 36:37.446
...you could encode
a new president, yes.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.490
Then that is what you will do.

36:39.657 --> 36:43.786
And you will have your contract secured
for the next 200 years.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.038
Missile defense batteries, droids.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.166
Everything we need to protect our liberty.

36:49.333 --> 36:54.338
All guaranteed, of course,
by your new president.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.765
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.812
This is the guy.

37:10.938 --> 37:13.816
- This is the guy?
- This is him.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.568
Sit down.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.447
We're gonna cut you a good one.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.533
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.119
Let's get him an ID first.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.830
Get the chief
one of them identification codes.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.248
Get that ready.

37:29.498 --> 37:31.083
Arm up.

37:36.922 --> 37:41.510
That'll merge with the DNA
and you'll fit in like you were born there.

37:43.888 --> 37:45.765
Now it's time for the real fun.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.023
Okay. What we got?

38:05.534 --> 38:06.577
Hey, man.

38:07.411 --> 38:11.040
Yo. Is this gonna hurt?

38:13.209 --> 38:16.462
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt.
It's gonna hurt good.

38:16.629 --> 38:19.882
When we're done with you,
you're gonna be a favela ninja.

38:20.049 --> 38:23.969
Marianna, hey, bring down the bone saw.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.518
- Bring the bone saw!
- This ain't gonna kill me.

38:30.893 --> 38:33.687
You're gonna be all right, my brother.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.649
Max.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.901
I'm here.

38:40.736 --> 38:43.739
We got this, man. We got this.

38:46.450 --> 38:47.910
Yeah.

39:41.630 --> 39:42.965
Hey!

39:43.132 --> 39:44.383
He's awake!

39:46.302 --> 39:49.305
You made it, huh? Surprise.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.020
You can still jack off.

39:57.354 --> 39:59.648
- How's everything going?
- He's ready to kick ass.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.448
What the fuck did you do to me?

40:09.700 --> 40:11.160
Gave you a way out.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.462
Damn.

41:06.757 --> 41:10.636
What's up, partner?
How's that suit working out for you, man?

41:12.429 --> 41:14.598
That shit is tight.

41:14.765 --> 41:16.392
Show me.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.148
Hold that.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.986
What's this, a family heirloom?

41:27.569 --> 41:28.612
Wait for it.

41:31.156 --> 41:34.326
Air-bursting ammunition.
Designate your enemy...

41:34.493 --> 41:38.080
...and any round you fire will explode
around them, five-meter kill radius.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.249
And...

41:41.250 --> 41:44.670
...synced detonation rounds
for this bad boy.

41:44.837 --> 41:46.505
That'll work.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.173
Move out.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.685
Sir?

41:59.852 --> 42:01.854
Shuttle is ready.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.374
Do you read me?

42:27.463 --> 42:28.839
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

42:29.006 --> 42:31.133
We'll wait outside the factory
until we see his shuttle leave.

42:31.300 --> 42:35.054
One of you puts an explosive round in it,
goes to the crash site, gets the data.

42:36.805 --> 42:37.806
Okay. Copy that.

42:42.561 --> 42:45.314
<i>Camera's live, boys.
You getting this, Spider?</i>

42:45.481 --> 42:47.316
I got it. Let's go. Let's play ball.

42:47.983 --> 42:50.652
- Move out of the way.
- Coming through.

42:57.159 --> 42:59.661
- You nervous?
- No.

42:59.828 --> 43:00.996
No?

43:03.332 --> 43:05.375
I'm shitting my pants.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.342
- We're not gonna fucking die here.
- Yeah.

43:35.197 --> 43:36.240
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

43:51.463 --> 43:55.467
<i>Acceleration to supersonic speeds
in 15 seconds.</i>

44:06.228 --> 44:08.021
Come on, come on, come on.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.740
<i>Critical engine failure.</i>

44:21.076 --> 44:24.121
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen
on Earth in danger.

44:24.288 --> 44:25.747
Data coming up now.

44:27.541 --> 44:30.586
<i>Citizen identified. John Carlyle.
N8321P...</i>

44:32.588 --> 44:34.548
I see you, motherfucker.

44:38.594 --> 44:40.262
I have a situation here.

44:40.429 --> 44:42.181
<i>Kruger, do you read me?</i>

44:42.347 --> 44:45.976
Miss Delacourt,
how lovely to hear your voice.

44:46.143 --> 44:49.396
There is a citizen carrying
sensitive brain data out of the city.

44:49.563 --> 44:52.441
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it.
- What's in it?

44:52.608 --> 44:53.775
<i>That's classified.</i>

44:53.942 --> 44:56.778
You don't call
a recently deactivated agent...

44:56.945 --> 44:59.698
...to retrieve classified
fucking information, man.

44:59.865 --> 45:01.992
<i>The government doesn't know
about this, do they?</i>

45:02.159 --> 45:04.620
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?

45:09.541 --> 45:10.709
<i>Please brace for impact.</i>

45:18.217 --> 45:21.136
Please remain calm.
You have sustained zero injuries.

45:21.303 --> 45:22.804
Oh, that's a real comfort.

45:28.143 --> 45:31.772
<i>I got one condition.
I do this, I get reinstated.</i>

45:31.939 --> 45:36.360
Fine. I've recommissioned
two of your preferred agents...

45:36.526 --> 45:38.362
<i>...completely confidentially, of course.</i>

45:38.528 --> 45:40.864
<i>They should be at your position any second.</i>

45:41.031 --> 45:42.824
<i>Send me the mission data.</i>

46:00.467 --> 46:02.427
Let's go, guys. Out of the cars.

46:08.267 --> 46:13.605
Droids, there appears to be
some type of wheeled vehicle with one...

46:15.899 --> 46:17.025
Two occupants...

46:17.693 --> 46:20.112
...and they are armed
and I'd like them dead.

46:23.282 --> 46:24.866
Droid!

46:31.623 --> 46:32.791
It's jammed! It's jammed!

46:37.587 --> 46:40.257
<i>- No!

46:45.929 --> 46:47.222
Come on.

46:55.314 --> 46:56.398
It's jammed, man!

46:57.607 --> 46:59.151
Got it.

47:01.862 --> 47:03.655
He's reloading!

47:22.632 --> 47:25.052
- You all right?
- We gotta go faster. I got the door.

47:25.218 --> 47:27.220
Go, go! I got you covered!

47:27.929 --> 47:29.598
Go, go, go.

47:40.776 --> 47:42.444
Don't fucking move.

47:47.574 --> 47:49.451
- Bring it!
- There's another one.

47:51.995 --> 47:53.872
Die, motherfucker!

47:57.542 --> 47:59.127
Don't hit the mark!

48:52.472 --> 48:54.641
No, no, no! No, no!
He got hit, he got hit!

48:54.808 --> 48:58.103
<i>Citizen has sustained
a cardiothoracic trauma.</i>

48:58.270 --> 48:59.938
<i>Blood pressure is dropping.</i>

49:00.105 --> 49:02.190
It's not in the head. It's in the chest.

49:02.357 --> 49:05.360
We're fucking good, man.
Hold his head. Hold his head.

49:05.861 --> 49:08.196
Plug this into you.
Come on, get that shit in.

49:10.532 --> 49:11.741
- Come on, baby.
- It's in.

49:12.242 --> 49:13.577
- Yes.
- Is it working?

49:13.743 --> 49:15.203
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.

49:15.370 --> 49:19.416
You have no idea what you're doing.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.379
One minute to target, sir.

49:27.507 --> 49:31.094
All right. All right, we're synced.
Come on, baby, here we go.

49:32.762 --> 49:35.223
It's gonna work. We got it.
It's gonna work.

49:35.390 --> 49:38.310
It's a data heist, ma'am.
They're downloading now.

49:43.273 --> 49:44.816
Guys, we got incoming.

49:45.817 --> 49:46.985
Oh, fuck me.

49:49.279 --> 49:50.780
Come on, guys, hurry up.

49:50.947 --> 49:52.741
That's a Raven. That's military.

49:52.908 --> 49:55.327
That's all right, we got this.
Ninety-seven, 98.

49:55.494 --> 49:57.370
- Hurry up! They're coming!
- Almost there.

49:57.537 --> 50:00.582
Ninety-nine! Ding, here we go!

50:03.126 --> 50:05.837
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.

50:06.254 --> 50:09.174
- What the fuck? What does that mean?
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

50:09.341 --> 50:10.550
I can't read the data.

50:10.717 --> 50:13.470
<i>- It's scrambled. I can't read the data.
- What?</i>

50:15.430 --> 50:16.932
Come on, guys, we gotta move!

50:17.098 --> 50:19.601
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean?
- Fuck this.

50:19.768 --> 50:22.687
No, no, no. We have to run it again!
Run it another time, man!

50:22.854 --> 50:25.607
Fucking get off me, man.
I'm fucking bailing.

50:25.774 --> 50:27.776
Please run it again.

50:27.943 --> 50:30.612
- I can't. Get the fuck off me.
- Let's get out of here.

50:30.779 --> 50:32.447
Where the fuck are you going, Sandro?

50:36.159 --> 50:38.620
- Let's get out of here!
- Goddamn it!

50:46.711 --> 50:48.296
Come on, Max.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.298
Get out of there! Let's go!

50:50.465 --> 50:54.010
We gotta go! Come on, Max. Come on.

50:56.179 --> 50:58.306
Hey, boss. We got a runner.

50:59.057 --> 51:00.642
Locked on.

51:00.809 --> 51:02.477
Fire!

51:14.739 --> 51:15.782
Shit, man.

51:23.748 --> 51:25.250
That's what I'm talking about!

51:29.045 --> 51:31.381
Move, Max. It's coming.

51:35.969 --> 51:38.179
We got another one.

51:38.555 --> 51:39.598
Okay.

51:41.349 --> 51:43.184
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.

52:33.902 --> 52:35.487
Going into a holding pattern, sir.

52:36.488 --> 52:38.073
Where do you think you're going?

52:40.241 --> 52:41.451
Come on!

53:10.105 --> 53:12.440
Fuck! Fucker!

53:17.404 --> 53:18.613
Come on.

53:19.155 --> 53:20.573
No!

53:59.529 --> 54:01.531
No. No.

54:02.365 --> 54:03.575
No.

54:03.908 --> 54:05.410
Get up!

54:12.917 --> 54:14.586
Get up!

54:23.261 --> 54:24.596
No!

54:43.364 --> 54:46.534
We've got one assailant
leaving on foot, ma'am.

54:46.701 --> 54:48.745
They have the data. Repeat:

54:49.204 --> 54:52.916
<i>The thieves have the data.

54:53.082 --> 54:55.210
<i>Do not damage his brain.</i>

Let's go! We got a runner, boys!

55:03.218 --> 55:07.138
<i>Citizen has suffered catastrophic
blood loss leading to cardiac arrest.</i>

55:07.555 --> 55:10.975
<i>Time of death: 1745.</i>

55:54.936 --> 55:58.690
Come on, where are you hiding?
What's that?

56:09.158 --> 56:10.785
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.122
Fuck you, man! Find him!

56:14.289 --> 56:16.958
Take us back to the crash site.
See what they left behind.

56:17.125 --> 56:18.126
Roger that.

56:55.079 --> 56:59.000
Hey, boss.
I think you'd better come look at this.

57:00.752 --> 57:02.629
This is a record of what we picked up...

57:02.795 --> 57:05.256
...in transfer between Carlyle
and the criminal, sir.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.259
That's why she wants it so badly.

57:08.635 --> 57:11.846
He's got the keys to the kingdom
in his fucking head.

57:12.722 --> 57:14.807
Now we just need to find him.

57:16.809 --> 57:18.728
I'm gonna let the girls out.

57:28.196 --> 57:30.031
<i>Searching grids three through 11.</i>

57:31.741 --> 57:34.410
I'm authorizing a full containment order.

57:34.577 --> 57:37.038
Issue a no-fly zone for Los Angeles.

57:37.538 --> 57:40.291
- All of Los Angeles?
- The murderer is still out there.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.878
Until we apprehend him,
no one leaves the surface of that city.

57:52.220 --> 57:54.055
What the...?

57:58.226 --> 57:59.894
Max.

58:42.437 --> 58:44.772
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

58:44.939 --> 58:46.774
We can go home.

58:47.483 --> 58:49.235
Am I better?

58:51.237 --> 58:54.240
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

58:57.160 --> 58:58.453
Be right back.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.626
Frey...

59:07.670 --> 59:08.963
Max.

59:11.799 --> 59:14.510
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

59:16.596 --> 59:19.348
- Shit. Let me get the medics.
- No. No.

59:20.016 --> 59:21.559
I can't go in there.

59:21.726 --> 59:24.479
- Max, listen to me. You need a doctor.
- I can't go in there.

59:24.645 --> 59:26.773
People are looking for me.
They'll kill me.

59:26.939 --> 59:28.941
- I came for you. I need your help.
- Max.

59:29.108 --> 59:31.652
You've got to go through the system
to get treatment.

59:31.819 --> 59:35.907
Please help me. I don't wanna die.

59:38.409 --> 59:39.869
Max.

59:40.036 --> 59:41.871
Max.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.166
Stay awake.

59:54.217 --> 59:55.760
I wanna see the man.

59:56.719 --> 59:59.889
Mommy's gonna help him, okay?
Try and sleep.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.686
Don't sleep.

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.609
Come on.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.112
Max, you can do it, come on.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:17.615
Stay awake.

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:18.783
Let's turn you over.

01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:08.708
Max. Max, wait.

01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:13.796
Thank you.

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:15.256
Who did this to you?

01:01:15.423 --> 01:01:18.551
Oh, no, I got...
I got hurt at work, and I had to...

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:23.723
I had to take a job from Spider
to try to get up there and get healed.

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:25.266
It went bad.

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:27.476
- I'm in trouble.
- Mommy?

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:33.191
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:40.615
Who's that man?

01:01:41.032 --> 01:01:45.453
His name is Max. Mommy knew him
when he was your age.

01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:47.121
This is Matilda.

01:01:47.997 --> 01:01:49.624
Hi.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:54.587
You can go watch cartoons, okay?
I'll be right there.

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.633
I didn't-- I didn't know you had...

01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:01.969
- I'm so sorry. I need to go.
- Wait, Max. Wait.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:04.347
- Don't leave. Wait.
- I shouldn't have come here.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:08.643
Max. She's dying.
She's in the final stages of leukemia.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:11.479
I told you my life was complicated.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:15.942
I need you to help me.
I have no idea how to do this.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.152
- How to do what?
- Get her to Elysium.

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:21.239
- I can't help her. I would...
- Max.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:25.159
- I would if I could.
- What about this? Fake citizenship.

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:28.329
If you took her there,
could you heal her with this?

01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:31.332
It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me.

01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:33.000
It's locked to my DNA.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.002
These people
who are looking for me--

01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:37.713
You don't understand who these people are.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.174
If they find me here,
they will kill all of us.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:43.344
The only thing I can do to help you
is leave, I promise you.

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:46.847
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:52.812 --> 01:02:54.689
You have bandages.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.776
Yeah, I got bandages.

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:06.784
- What are you doing?
- I don't want you to be sick.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:10.371
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- No--

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.709
There once was a meerkat
who lived in the jungle.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.878
He was hungry, but he was small.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:23.134
So small. And the other big animals
had all the food...

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.720
...because they could reach the fruits.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.889
So he made friends
with a hippopotamus to--

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.308
Okay, stop.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:34.603
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:40.901
Yes, it does, because he can stand
on the hippopotamus's back...

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:44.322
...to get all the fruits that he wants.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.115
What's in it for the hippo?

01:03:46.282 --> 01:03:48.409
The hippo wants a friend.

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:06.927
I'm sorry.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:46.300
Hey, boss.

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:50.638
I think we got him.

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:57.978
Land this fucking craft.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:27.007
- Mommy, is everything okay?
- It's okay, sweetie.

01:05:36.392 --> 01:05:37.810
Clear.

01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:41.730
It's okay, sweetie.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.650
Afternoon.

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:47.194
Sorry to come bursting into your home.

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:50.865
I didn't mean to traumatize
your young daughter.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.534
Me and the boys here...

01:05:53.701 --> 01:05:55.619
...we're looking
for a young gentleman...

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:58.080
...who was in this very house
a moment ago.

01:05:58.581 --> 01:06:01.417
We're hoping you can tell us where he went.

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:05.629
No. I...

01:06:07.423 --> 01:06:09.049
I don't know where he is.

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:14.472
I don't believe in committing violent acts
in front of kids...

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.057
...so I just need you to
close your eyes, sweetheart.

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:19.185
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:22.146
I really need you to tell me.

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:24.982
Where is he? You remember now?

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.567
- Mommy.
- Close your eyes.

01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:29.195
Keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.

01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:30.905
Please, I don't know where he is.

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:34.950
He was wounded.
I helped him and he left.

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:36.410
Please.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:39.747
Do you fucking hate that?
No loyalty nowadays, eh?

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.126
It's okay, sweetie.

01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:48.088
And what's this here? This a hospital
you running here? What's going on?

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:51.175
- She's sick.
- She's sick?

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.344
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.

01:06:54.512 --> 01:06:57.765
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct there, eh?

01:06:57.932 --> 01:06:59.183
I said don't touch her!

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:01.185
I'm trying to get a word with your child.

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:03.437
If you give me a second.
Bring her. Come.

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:06.148
- Where are you taking us?
- I've got something you want.

01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:07.399
- It's okay.
- Mommy.

01:07:07.566 --> 01:07:09.276
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:10.694
Sit down. Shut up.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.002
Stop.

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.130
Hey, hey, hey.

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:33.133
No, no, no.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.177
Put the guns down. Let him come.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:38.973
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?

01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:42.810
That's why they shut down the sky.
Come on. What is it? Wire transfers?

01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:45.104
Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big.

01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:46.564
I fucking got nothing, man.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:50.150
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me.

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:52.319
- Let's go fucking now!
- We can't!

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:54.738
The flight system is jammed!

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.657
Nobody is going up there.

01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:02.329
- Till when?
- Till I don't fucking know.

01:08:03.038 --> 01:08:06.375
- I gotta get up there, man.
- Oh, everyone needs to get up there.

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:09.044
My guys are working to see
if we have a hope in hell...

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:12.339
...which I personally think we do not,
of ever getting back online.

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:15.175
But for now...

01:08:15.384 --> 01:08:18.011
...let's just take a look
at that head of yours.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:21.348
- Get away from me, man.
- Just look at me.

01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:27.354
If they shut down the whole fucking sky
for what's in your head...

01:08:27.688 --> 01:08:32.192
...maybe the key to opening it
could be in there too, right?

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:35.237
Come on.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.743
All right.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:54.715
They will hunt you
to the edge of the Earth for this.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.300
What is it?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.053
It's a reboot program for Elysium.

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.932
Whoever has this has the power
to override their whole system.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.810
Open the borders.

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:10.981
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:17.363
This can save your life.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.741
We can save everyone.

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:22.076
When can I go?

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:24.828
They're trying to hack through
the signal jam, but soon.

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:29.416
- Don't bullshit me. When can we go?
- I don't know. Five days.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.086
Fuck you. I don't have five days.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:34.171
- I got hours.
- My guys are working on it.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.675
You're always working on it.
You can't get me up there.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.928
Why do you even try sending people up?
They just get shot down.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:43.596
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:47.017
We would control the system here.
We would be in charge.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.603
We can change the course
of fucking history here.

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:51.104
Back up, then.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:55.526
What I have in my head
is worth a lot to them, right?

01:09:57.069 --> 01:09:58.529
Don't do this.

01:09:58.696 --> 01:10:02.366
If that falls into the wrong hands,
they could shut us out for good.

01:10:02.533 --> 01:10:05.452
Listen, man,
I'm going up there right now.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:10.124
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed,
you can have all of this.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.210
- But I'm not fucking dying.
- This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.

01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:26.557
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

01:10:26.724 --> 01:10:28.684
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:37.025
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:42.906
I always wanted a wife.

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:49.204
I just couldn't quite settle down,
you know.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:52.124
Too much temptation.

01:10:55.127 --> 01:10:57.129
But you...

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.636
You make me ready to settle down.

01:11:04.803 --> 01:11:07.264
You really make me
wanna settle down, baby.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:21.278
Holy shit, sir.

01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:24.072
- You better take a look at this.
- What? What is it?

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.533
Check this fucking oke.

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:30.788
Turn us around.

01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:57.481
- Drakey?
- Yes?

01:11:57.648 --> 01:11:58.941
Open the door.

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:12.746
Stop right there!

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:17.251
You're gonna do exactly what I say
or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off!

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.796
- You understand?
- Yeah.

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:23.257
You can have everything in my head!

01:12:23.799 --> 01:12:26.760
Just take me up there
and get me in a med bay!

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:29.429
What I have is very valuable!

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:31.807
We can fix you up.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.060
Put you in a med bay,
sort all this kak up.

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:39.022
Let's go. We'll take you up there.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:42.192
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:44.653
<i>Lekker, you'll dig it.</i>

01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:47.531
Don't you fucking try anything.

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:51.660
<i>Step aboard. Come meet the boys.
Come, boet.</i>

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.288
Don't be shy. They won't bite.

01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:56.999
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey.

01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:59.501
- This is Max.
- How is it, butch?

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:01.628
Close up, Drakey.

01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:03.589
Copy that.

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:11.972
Crowe, let's go.

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:19.062
Yes, ma'am.
We apprehended the subject.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:21.231
Open the skies, we're coming home.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:23.483
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.

01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:39.166
Cancel the no-fly zone.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.001
Yes, ma'am.

01:13:42.878 --> 01:13:44.463
What?

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:47.633
What is that? What is that?
Are we back?

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:51.178
- What the fuck is that? Are we back?
- We're back online, Spider.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:04.566
Frey.

01:14:06.068 --> 01:14:08.779
I'm sorry. I'm gonna make this right.

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.042
We've got him.

01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:23.418
All right. Where is he?

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:27.089
He's leaving Earth, heading to Elysium.

01:14:32.928 --> 01:14:37.516
Manuel, Rico.
Get weapons. Let's get up there.

01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:47.317
Echo Leader 234
requesting landing in Sector 22.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:50.570
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234.
You are cleared for entry.

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:49.337
I see you got the G-19.

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:51.965
Hey, back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.

01:15:52.132 --> 01:15:53.341
- Or what?
- I'll let it go.

01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:54.968
What you gonna do, huh?

01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:57.471
I want what's in your head, boykie.

01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.890
Come on. Come on.

01:16:00.057 --> 01:16:01.850
Legs! Grab his legs!

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.027
Grab the grenade!

01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:13.695
Hold on!

01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:20.535
Get down!

01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:03.370
- What do you want us to do?
- I want everyone...

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:06.498
...coming out of that vehicle
apprehended by Homeland Security.

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:10.043
Evacuate everyone under Level 5
clearance out of the building now.

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:18.885
Matilda!

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.595
I warned you of this.

01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:24.057
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed,
potentially threatening the torus.

01:17:24.224 --> 01:17:28.353
All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.

01:17:29.146 --> 01:17:32.732
- Get your hands off of me.
- This is an act of war.

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:35.777
That puts the CCB under my control.

01:17:36.236 --> 01:17:38.238
Now, if you'd let me do my job...

01:17:38.405 --> 01:17:41.908
...I'm sure you have
a fundraiser to attend.

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:43.577
Let's go, sir.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:51.960
Why are you not answering me?

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.632
Max.

01:17:57.799 --> 01:18:01.970
- Take me out of here, Max!
- Yeah. I'm trying!

01:18:02.846 --> 01:18:05.348
<i>Air quality reaching toxic levels.</i>

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:12.939
Get me out of here.

01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:16.526
<i>It is recommended
you exit the craft immediately.</i>

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:30.123
- Run!
- Come here, you fucker.

01:18:46.223 --> 01:18:48.850
Two illegals heading northeast in Zone 3.

01:18:57.192 --> 01:19:00.320
You deal with those two.
I'll handle this poes.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:04.908
<i>Welcome to this spectacular property,
sprawling over...</i>

01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:18.296
<i>Error.</i>

01:19:19.047 --> 01:19:22.425
<i>- No.
- No citizen detected.</i>

01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:29.349
Please. She's sick. Help us.
She's gone into a coma. Please.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:57.711
Shouldn't we remove this thing?

01:19:57.877 --> 01:20:02.173
Can't, till we get all the data.
It's wired into him neurologically.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.009
The data is intact, yes?

01:20:05.302 --> 01:20:06.428
Data looks intact.

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:08.096
<i>Warning.</i>

01:20:08.263 --> 01:20:10.974
We can still pull the data out of him,
which will kill him.

01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:15.603
Oh, that's fine. How long before you can
download and turn the system online?

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.063
Not long, ma'am.

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:20.734
Keep everything in a restricted cloud.
Lock down all access.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.068
Starting prep right now.

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:27.574
And get these two out of here.

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:29.409
Roger that.

01:20:29.576 --> 01:20:32.412
Crowe, you wanna go get the boss's chicks?

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:34.414
<i>Yeah, boet.</i>

01:20:59.356 --> 01:21:02.942
Give them the runaround.
Keep them busy.

01:21:06.696 --> 01:21:07.906
Got him.

01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:09.449
Let's go.

01:21:09.616 --> 01:21:12.869
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy.
You ready?

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.914
What are you taking out of him?

01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:19.292
Hey. What are you doing to him?

01:21:19.459 --> 01:21:21.503
What's gonna happen to him? Hey.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.464
Rise and shine.

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.633
- Get up.
- Max.

01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:29.219
Max. Max!

01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:31.137
Max!

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:46.653
Get in there.

01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:53.326
Away.

01:21:57.539 --> 01:21:58.581
Boss got fucked up, eh?

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:00.875
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:08.049
His brain is fine, but he's gonna
be pissed when he wakes up, eh?

01:22:08.216 --> 01:22:11.511
Remember the kak that happened
in India when he lost his legs.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:36.619
Kruger.

01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:40.748
Hey, boss.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:44.169
It's Crowe.

01:22:46.713 --> 01:22:49.257
Where is he?

01:22:50.675 --> 01:22:51.843
All right. We're all set.

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.179
Okay. Let's re-sedate him.

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:58.099
Got the needle prepped.
Here, you wanna grab this and then--

01:22:58.266 --> 01:23:00.894
Grab the needle! Grab the needle!
Stick him with it!

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:23.583
- Where did they take the girls?
- The armory.

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:27.962
- Where the fuck is that?
- Level three.

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:37.722
<i>Lethal radiation poisoning detected.</i>

01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:40.850
<i>You require urgent medical attention.</i>

01:23:47.899 --> 01:23:51.528
You idiot.
Do you realize what you've done?

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:56.199
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle
into a suburban area.

01:23:57.784 --> 01:24:01.454
Your orders were to keep this covert.

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:04.832
Do you even remember what that means?

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.796
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:11.464
You're useless to me.

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:14.467
If the administration realized
what we're doing...

01:24:14.634 --> 01:24:16.928
...they'd hang us both for treason.

01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:21.975
For God's sake, Kruger,
are you listening to me?

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:25.478
Yes.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.648
Yes, ma'am...

01:24:29.399 --> 01:24:30.650
...I'm listening.

01:24:32.694 --> 01:24:37.490
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle
and ruined someone's lawn.

01:24:37.657 --> 01:24:40.243
But nobody is gonna hang us for treason.

01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:42.495
We do the hanging.

01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:48.543
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.

01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:51.296
Not so chirpy now, eh?

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:55.842
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about
to get its first proper president.

01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:02.890
She needs some medical attention.

01:25:09.063 --> 01:25:11.024
I was gonna heal your daughter.

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:14.569
But now I will make sure
that she is never healed.

01:25:15.695 --> 01:25:18.364
Drakey, don't trust
any of these politicians.

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:22.452
- You clear out this whole building.
- Thank you, boss.

01:25:22.619 --> 01:25:26.039
I'm gonna find that little gangster
and I'm gonna take what's in his head.

01:25:26.414 --> 01:25:28.583
This place is mine now.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:32.045
You wanna come to my fucking house
and play? Let's play.

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:35.423
I'm going to annihilate
that little motherfucker.

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:38.051
I'm going to pulverize that little one.

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:44.057
Hey!

01:25:52.607 --> 01:25:53.650
What the hell was that?

01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:59.572

<i>Max, where are you?</i>

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:54.460
The thing in my head, it can make
everyone a citizen here, right?

01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:58.965
<i>- Yeah.
- You know how to get it out, right?</i>

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:00.883
<i>- Yes.

<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:04.178

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:41.382
Okay.

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:47.263
- Crowe, get rid of those two.
- My pleasure, boss. My pleasure.

Where are you?</i>

01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:10.453
How is it, girl?

01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:13.581
- Let's play.
- No.

01:28:13.748 --> 01:28:16.459
- Come on. I'll be nice, I promise.
- No, please.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.419
- Come on.
- Get off me.

01:28:18.586 --> 01:28:20.004
- Want me to hurt the girl?
- No.

01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:21.631
- Then come here.
- Please.

01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:53.246

You fucker!

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.343
The only way out of here is through me.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:34.453
- Is she alive?
- For now.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.205
Stay behind me.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:40.126
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:29:40.293 --> 01:29:42.003
I have a plan.

You hear that sound?
That's the sound of me coming for you.

01:29:52.388 --> 01:29:54.807
I will find you! I will hunt you down!

01:29:56.976 --> 01:29:59.228
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up.
- What?

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:02.189
Listen. You're gonna go to
the surface, okay? Take this.

01:30:02.356 --> 01:30:04.692
All right. Find a house.
Get her to a med bay.

- Don't stop for anybody.

01:30:06.903 --> 01:30:12.033

- No.
- I promise.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:42.188
Okay. A mother and a daughter
just went up in that elevator right there.

01:30:42.355 --> 01:30:44.690
They're going to the surface,
headed for a med bay.

01:30:44.857 --> 01:30:48.736

they get there, and we have our deal.
