36:23.920 --> 36:25.357
Why didn't you tell me?

36:25.400 --> 36:29.317
Because we had
more pressing matters and...

36:29.361 --> 36:32.755
I guess if I said it out loud,
it would feel more real.

36:34.148 --> 36:36.237
All right, well, you're not
going at this alone.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.804
You got us.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.719
Look,
it's too late for that.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.112
So I'm gonna go out there,

36:42.156 --> 36:43.766
and I'm gonna
distract the Robos,

36:43.810 --> 36:46.204
and you guys need to make
a run for the Waverider.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.553
No way, jefa.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.642
Yeah,
we're going home together.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.862
If World War I doesn't happen,

36:52.906 --> 36:54.690
history will change so much

36:54.734 --> 36:58.651
that none of us
will have a home to go back to.

36:58.694 --> 36:59.869
I have to do this.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.784
I have to protect
the Fixed Point.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.177
Now when this hits zero,

37:03.221 --> 37:04.831
I'm gonna get sucked
into a time loop,

37:04.874 --> 37:06.963
and I need you to tell Ava...

37:07.007 --> 37:09.270
you tell her
to come and find me.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.533
- Sara, just--
- Please.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.667
As your captain,

could never do.
