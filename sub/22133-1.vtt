idea of success is a little bit of sand
in that training center for cabana boys

big cliff

28:13.170 --> 28:16.920
I'm still not clear on what you're
proposing is not a subject actually yeah

28:16.920 --> 28:17.670
I am

28:17.670 --> 28:20.430
all right look we both know the
transition is going to go belly-up that

28:20.430 --> 28:21.360
a sponsor

28:21.359 --> 28:25.799
I'll be that sponsor ok some sand around
promoting logo products to three

28:25.799 --> 28:28.169
weekends with the beach is exclusively
for races

28:28.170 --> 28:32.310
something to think about one more thing
I want to do part time work from

28:32.309 --> 28:36.569
I've got a top you just watch out for my
interests at the center that's all

28:36.569 --> 28:40.109
and when everyone on the island

28:40.769 --> 28:43.799
maybe i'll show you some of the deals
and working on get your opinion

28:44.339 --> 28:53.730
look quick one I can't stand you - I'm
looking to help Sean build the center

28:53.730 --> 29:00.150
not help you subvert that's not what I'm
doing just what are you doing cliff

29:03.160 --> 29:04.080
yeah

29:04.079 --> 29:07.079
listen

29:07.700 --> 29:10.900
I let your old friends hash things out

29:10.900 --> 29:13.250
good night night

29:13.250 --> 29:18.890
think about what I said Lee you don't
know in the water

29:18.890 --> 29:23.270
we don't know the beach you don't know
the people it's a matter of fact you

29:23.269 --> 29:24.440
don't squat

29:24.440 --> 29:27.799
I talked to who I want what I want about
what I want

29:28.849 --> 29:32.539
money talks and your God lifeguard crap
walks

29:32.539 --> 29:36.139
you know why with all you've got in this
world that you're here doing this clip

29:36.140 --> 29:40.550
because nothing you have no I have done
can erase the fact that underneath the

29:40.549 --> 29:41.240
height

29:41.240 --> 29:44.660
you're weak York hours

29:46.960 --> 29:50.528
well that's true why did you ever let me
have my race here you really wanna know

29:51.069 --> 29:54.069
yeah

29:55.700 --> 29:58.700
so it's arson

29:59.910 --> 30:02.419
I still do

30:02.419 --> 30:05.538
yeah

30:05.538 --> 30:08.490
all right no more games you got it

30:08.490 --> 30:11.789
I'm not gonna let you try and fix what's
wrong with your life right bringing me

30:11.789 --> 30:16.019
under and you do your race you get out
of my life for good

30:44.759 --> 30:49.710
man i am not in the mood for this cliff
Sean just here to say I'm sorry i was

30:49.710 --> 30:50.880
out of line

30:50.880 --> 30:56.370
yeah I know I've said story before but
this time it's from the heart and I know

30:56.369 --> 31:00.000
how much the center means to you so here

31:00.000 --> 31:06.390
no hard feelings what's this first
installment is your sponsor my sponsor

31:08.230 --> 31:11.829
and whose idea was this actually
something we and I've been working out

31:11.829 --> 31:13.418
to give you the financial bitch you need

31:13.419 --> 31:16.840
Lee yeah there's your problem

31:17.380 --> 31:21.140
she told me she can't speak for him

31:21.140 --> 31:28.940
keep your money cliff come on Shawn
don't let your pride get away with tyler

31:28.940 --> 31:30.890
is never going to be our sponsor

31:30.890 --> 31:34.820
I never said that to him Shawn I swear
to you what you did talk about a deal

31:34.819 --> 31:35.599
right

31:35.599 --> 31:39.649
he proposed one and i was going to
present it to you as soon as I got close

31:39.650 --> 31:42.290
to something that we could work with Lee

31:42.289 --> 31:45.170
I know you were trying to help but
nothing goes on regarding this Center

31:45.170 --> 31:47.900
without me knowing about it clear course
on

31:47.900 --> 31:51.050
I jumped too fast on this it won't
happen again

31:52.880 --> 31:57.050
look please try and understand

31:57.049 --> 32:00.980
I brought you on from Hawaii lifeguards
not just because of your talent because

32:00.980 --> 32:02.779
the person that I think you are

32:02.779 --> 32:09.559
cliff Tyler is the exact opposite i know
i was just after his money

32:10.099 --> 32:13.099
I'm not okay

32:14.940 --> 32:18.390
look it's it's my fault in the first
place I should never have allowed him to

32:18.390 --> 32:19.230
have his race

32:19.230 --> 32:25.829
just no more deals with him nor nor
discussions nor anything

32:25.829 --> 32:28.829
ok sure no no problem

32:35.690 --> 32:40.490
can I ask you what happened between the
two of you

32:44.839 --> 32:47.839
ok

32:48.970 --> 32:50.529
ten years ago

32:50.529 --> 32:54.639
we were doing tones jars and you know
how when after the skier gets the out

32:54.640 --> 32:55.000
there

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
stand by watch pictures you'll get in

32:58.539 --> 33:01.539
and believe me I i know that that can
get really hairy

33:01.539 --> 33:05.379
but you do it you do it because the guy
in the board has put his life in your

33:05.380 --> 33:07.970
hands

33:07.970 --> 33:11.750
cliff got scared and he left me

33:11.750 --> 33:14.400
die

33:14.400 --> 33:17.400
another surfer hadn't come along in the
next set

33:17.970 --> 33:23.220
going to hear today Shawn just got a
Weather Service advisory we've got a

33:23.220 --> 33:26.220
nasty front coming out of the north

33:40.898 --> 33:42.129
doing

33:42.130 --> 33:44.110
I'm closing the beach shutting down the

33:44.109 --> 33:48.039
race what it's a safety issue clip I
don't give me that crap

33:49.000 --> 33:54.009
that's your to technique a lot of
control look at you man strutting around

33:54.009 --> 33:56.769
here acting all superior you're such a
pain

33:56.769 --> 34:00.190
judge and everybody in some standard
doesn't even exist

34:00.190 --> 34:03.190
no wonder your wife left you

34:05.599 --> 34:08.599
don't open that door cliff why not

34:09.139 --> 34:12.289
he looked out the whole world from your
lifeguard monk town it's all crap

34:12.858 --> 34:15.829
two seconds I could play a little dream
right out from under you do a better job

34:15.829 --> 34:20.268
at it too but no one around here respect
your self righteous act any more than I

34:20.268 --> 34:20.929
do

34:20.929 --> 34:25.219
so what this is all about cliff huh make
a few million on your prize money and

34:25.219 --> 34:27.079
peddling your butt for endorsements

34:27.079 --> 34:32.210
you think you can come out here and buy
whatever mind you want go ahead go ahead

34:32.210 --> 34:37.820
cliff but you know you can't buy a
second chance you can't change what you

34:37.820 --> 34:40.820
did you want to find out who still got
it Superman

34:41.929 --> 34:45.409

38:23.730 --> 38:29.469
history with and they happen to be
wealthy and they happen -

38:29.469 --> 38:32.500
I at least want to partially sponsor the
center

38:32.500 --> 38:37.869
I think you might be agreeable I might
let me know who they are first all right

38:37.869 --> 38:40.809
i have a whole truckload of personal
instant

38:40.809 --> 38:42.259
you're kidding me

38:42.260 --> 38:46.730
Sean well thanks like it wasn't smart

38:46.730 --> 38:51.349
sure and it wasn't safe as you can help
my broken collarbones

38:51.349 --> 38:55.610
but when the storm shut down my race i
still had to compete not against other

38:55.610 --> 39:00.769
racers and against the waves and when
the waves got me down i had to count on

39:00.769 --> 39:01.820
one person

39:01.820 --> 39:06.650
it was at that person was myself

39:10.559 --> 39:14.219
how are those waves out there clip was
in pretty bad it is one thing to run

39:14.219 --> 39:16.199
yourself that this sum 0

39:16.199 --> 39:20.789
you know which one of your lady I don't
know who you are

39:20.789 --> 39:26.099

not me when you're so no it's not he is

39:26.099 --> 39:30.269
the liar and then they said that's
enough right there

39:34.869 --> 39:37.869
I'm sorry

39:42.480 --> 39:46.289
ok

39:48.260 --> 39:53.120
