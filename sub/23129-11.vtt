00:01.760 --> 00:03.626
- Previously...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.593
The wolf is winning!
Just get out!

00:05.630 --> 00:07.769
- Please don't go.
- I'm scared of you.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.666
Find a way to deal
with what you are.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.202
- Are you two ready for
the flack you'll catch

00:12.240 --> 00:13.230
from both sides?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.203
- Astrid's above
that gang-war stuff.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.140
(Screaming)

00:17.180 --> 00:18.648
- You gotta stop them!
- Astrid?

00:18.680 --> 00:22.218
- The wolves got Josh.
- Come on! Come on!

00:22.250 --> 00:23.513
(Groaning)

00:23.550 --> 00:26.110
- (Sally):
I fell in love with Aidan.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.686
- (Aidan): Have we
done that before?

00:28.720 --> 00:30.427
- Let's talk
about it.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.155
- She's sending
me a message.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.793
I'm supposed
to help her.

00:33.830 --> 00:37.789
- Carl and Joy Bensen with daughter.
- Beatrice.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.390
- Would you say you had
a normal childhood?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.169
- Why do you ask?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.269
- Someone tried
human-sacrificing you.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.233
- Please!
- The blood of the child...

00:46.280 --> 00:48.533
- NO!

00:50.580 --> 00:53.641
(Sighing)

00:56.290 --> 01:00.716
OK, how did you
get here, Sally?

01:03.330 --> 01:05.549
Did you do magic?

01:05.590 --> 01:07.297
No!

01:07.330 --> 01:09.560
(Sighing)

01:14.740 --> 01:16.708
It's the possession.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.199
You possessed those werewolves
to help Aidan.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.204
You kissed him!

01:24.350 --> 01:26.148
You're talking to yourself,

01:29.620 --> 01:31.315
(Sighing)

01:31.350 --> 01:32.852
- (Nora):
Are you awake?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.853
(Sighing)

01:35.890 --> 01:37.221
Easy!

01:37.260 --> 01:39.695
You're pretty
banged up.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.620
- There's new
wolves out there.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.729
(Sighing)

01:46.770 --> 01:48.329
Wolves I made.

01:48.370 --> 01:52.238
- It's not your fault.
They made you do it.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.830
Let's hope that's
enough for Mark.

01:55.880 --> 01:59.339
Hopefully, he'll cut his
losses and leave us alone.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.717
- Where are you going?

02:02.750 --> 02:04.218
- Back to my place.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.912
I wanted to stay to make
sure that you were OK.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.348
It doesn't mean
that I'm back.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.795
- Wait.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.792
Please.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.637
Please don't leave me.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.764
You're the only thing
that keeps me safe.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.370
The only thing
that keeps me here.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.401
- I can't handle
that responsibility.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.399
- (Josh): I'm trying so hard
to find ways to get better.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.417
- Josh?

02:32.450 --> 02:34.373
- But all I can
think to do

02:34.420 --> 02:36.411
is to be completely
honest with you.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.782
- I can't be the only thing
that keeps you human.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.755
Besides, I don't even
think that that's true!

02:41.790 --> 02:43.952
- It's absolutely true.
You're everything to me.

02:43.990 --> 02:45.685
- Sally?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.520
- Hi.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.835
- (Josh): Why are you
in our closet?

02:53.870 --> 02:59.309
- ** T want you more
than I need you *

02:59.340 --> 03:03.277
* I need you bad *

03:04.480 --> 03:06.642
* I'm waiting **

03:06.680 --> 03:07.977
(Grunting)

03:08.020 --> 03:08.976
- Hey, wake up.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.909
- What? What?

03:10.950 --> 03:14.818
Oh my God! Is Josh...
Did he scratch someone?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.521
(Yawning)

03:16.560 --> 03:17.925
Is he making eggs?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.327
- I just discovered
something, something big.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.657
- Well, good
for you, Sally.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.964
Sally, Sally, Sally!
Are you-- You're OK?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.399
- Yes!

03:25.430 --> 03:26.568
- Thank God you're OK.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.738
- Yeah.

03:27.770 --> 03:30.262
- Did you just shake me
awake with your hand?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.266
- Yes!

03:31.310 --> 03:32.471
- What, you can touch me?

03:32.510 --> 03:34.877
Since when? What--
How did this happen?

03:34.910 --> 03:37.880
- I don't know. Last night,
I got all grudge-y again,

03:37.910 --> 03:40.550
and then I fell asleep,
and then I woke up,

03:40.580 --> 03:42.014
and then I was
like... this!

03:42.050 --> 03:45.315
- Ow! OK, well, that's awesome,
but how did-- What did you--

03:45.350 --> 03:46.715
How did you
make this happen?

03:46.760 --> 03:47.716
- I don't know.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.353
- Was it magic?
Is it a spell?

03:49.390 --> 03:51.859
- I don't know. I don't
remember casting a spell.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.858
Who cares? I'm as
corporeal as a mofo!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.254
- Perfect!
Yes, you are!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.898
So, what does that mean?

03:58.930 --> 04:01.331
- I don't know if this
Is temporary or not,

04:01.370 --> 04:03.304
so I just, I really
want to enjoy it.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.705
- Yeah, of course.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.004
- So that's why
I came down here.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.599
- Yeah-- Oh! Um...

04:08.640 --> 04:09.607
(Chuckling)

04:09.650 --> 04:11.607
Sally.
- What? Shut up!

04:11.650 --> 04:13.470
I know you liked
kissing me,

04:13.520 --> 04:16.841
and I was like a random
werewolf dude at the time.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.779
Like I said,

04:18.820 --> 04:22.586
I really don't know
how much time we have.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.621
(Moaning quietly)

04:25.660 --> 04:27.059
Can't we just enjoy it?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.762
(Moaning)

04:29.800 --> 04:31.894
Hmm?

04:33.500 --> 04:36.731
- OK. OK.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.616
(Clattering)

04:54.660 --> 04:55.957
- I'm sorry!

04:55.990 --> 04:57.754
<i>- Oh, it</i>

04:57.790 --> 05:00.054
- Sorry, I'm just looking
for a sl-- Oh my God!

05:00.100 --> 05:01.397
- Whoa! I'm so sorry.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.023
- No, I'm sorry!
It was my fault.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.789
Shouldn't be down here.
Shouldn't be looking there!

05:05.830 --> 05:08.834
Uh, it just kind of lunged
from under the covers!

05:08.870 --> 05:11.669
- It lunged? OK, what
are you doing here?

05:11.710 --> 05:13.838
- Josh said there's a
sledgehammer down here.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.508
- What do you need
a sledgehammer for?

05:16.550 --> 05:17.642
(Sighing)

05:18.880 --> 05:20.974
Oh yeah!

05:22.550 --> 05:23.915
(Coughing)

05:23.950 --> 05:25.418
You guys get it?
Nothing?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.418
Come on. It's the
Kool-Aid guy.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.110
- Yeah, it's a
lifelong dream of mine

05:29.160 --> 05:32.391
to sledgehammer my way through
a wall into a secret room,

05:32.430 --> 05:34.694
but couldn't let me have
that one, could you?

05:34.730 --> 05:37.825
- You're not healthy enough
to swing a sledgehammer.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.565
I was trying to
help you out.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.568
- I think you wanted
to be Kool-Aid.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.829
- Maybe.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.929
- OK, guys, so I think
the important thing

05:44.970 --> 05:46.529
is that now we've all seen it,

05:46.580 --> 05:48.435
SO we can how leave
and close this up.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.972
- I wish we'd known
about this room before!

05:51.010 --> 05:53.411
- Yeah, it's got great light.
It's nice and big.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.578
I could've had a nice
craft room in here.

05:55.620 --> 05:58.146
Or, like, a ping-pong table.
I don't know.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.454
- Doesn't it strike
anyone as odd

06:00.490 --> 06:02.959
the fact that this
was always sealed up?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.459
Like, maybe it was like
this for a reason.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.959
- Yeah, there's definitely
bad vibes in here,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.991
and someone obviously
lived up here.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.465
Why would it be
all sealed up and hidden?

06:12.500 --> 06:16.459
- Guys, I've been in here
before, when I used my magic.

06:16.510 --> 06:20.105
This is where I saw the cult
weirdos and the little girl.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.474
I saw someone get murdered here.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.842
- But you didn't,
though, right?

06:25.880 --> 06:28.747
I mean, you--you checked
into it and she's still alive.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.043
It was just
a big mistake.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.513
- Not the biggest of
mistakes. Someone...

06:32.560 --> 06:33.516
(Sniffing)

06:33.560 --> 06:34.618
...definitely died.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.480
Right here.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.073
See, the blood soaked
into the floorboards.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.078
- You can smell
disco-era blood?

06:56.110 --> 06:57.600
- You can't?
- No!

06:57.650 --> 07:00.870
- What about those marks?
What are those?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.048
- That's the weird thing.
These marks--

07:03.090 --> 07:04.615
- Oh, that's the weird thing?

07:04.650 --> 07:06.084
That's the
weird thing! Sorry.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.886
- I was saying that these
marks are more recent.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.079
(Doorbell buzzing)

07:11.130 --> 07:12.996
- Thank God!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.195
- Hello.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.096
- Dad!
- Mr. Malik!

07:19.130 --> 07:20.097
- Have we met?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.892
- No, I'm sorry.
I just--

07:21.940 --> 07:23.066
(Clearing throat)

07:23.110 --> 07:24.532
Please, come in.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.732
- He looks so tired.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.969
- I just came by to make
final arrangements.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.510
- Final
arrangements?

07:34.550 --> 07:37.087
- This is Aidan and
this is my wife, Nora.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.212
- Hi.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.981
- Hello, hi. Um, what
final arrangements?

07:41.020 --> 07:42.556
- The house has been sold.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.649
The inspector will be
coming next week,

07:44.690 --> 07:47.955
then we can finalize
the paperwork.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.560
I'll need your keys
by the end of the week.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.125
- Uh, you know,
Mr. Malik,

07:52.170 --> 07:54.662
we just need a
little bit more time.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.533
- Robbie told me he gave you
notice, nearly a month.

07:57.570 --> 08:00.107
- He did. Uh, we just thought
that after he passed...

08:00.140 --> 08:02.575
- Josh!
- (Nora): What?

08:02.610 --> 08:04.248
- What he meant to say is

08:04.280 --> 08:07.944
that, uh, we ran into
some personal difficulties

08:07.980 --> 08:10.847
and we've fallen behind
on our packing, so...

08:10.890 --> 08:13.211
- I'm sorry, but it
doesn't change the facts.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.819
You can't stay here.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.828
- We need more time,
Mr. Malik.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.680
- You have till the
end of the week.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.994
- Guys, now is the time to beg.
You gotta beg.

08:21.030 --> 08:22.122
- I beg you,
Mr. Malik.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.889
- No! No!

08:25.730 --> 08:29.564
I'm sorry, but I need to
be rid of this house.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.635
I can't believe I
stepped back inside.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.570
- We understand entirely.
We're very sorry.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.601
- You have through
the weekend.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.914
I want your
keys on Monday.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.011
- (Whispering):
Oh my God!

08:44.049 --> 08:45.211
(Door closing)

08:52.260 --> 08:54.627
- Wait, what? No!
You're throwing that out?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.765
You've had some of
this stuff since before,

08:56.800 --> 08:58.268
like, a lot of
this other stuff.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.564
- Fresh start, new mojo.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.238
I'm cleaning it
all out, Sally.

09:02.270 --> 09:03.567
- Cleaning what out?

09:03.610 --> 09:04.736
- My life!

09:04.770 --> 09:07.899
I've been thinking about
this since last night.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.601
She was the last one.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.277
- The last what?

09:11.310 --> 09:13.574
- There's always been
a tie to my past

09:13.620 --> 09:15.645
that has prevented me
from moving on.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.151
Something or someone always
shows up and drags me back.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.659
And now, with
Suzanna gone,

09:22.690 --> 09:24.021
that's it.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.757
- Well, I'm glad to hear
you talk about Suzanna.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.894
You haven't really
spoken about her.

09:28.930 --> 09:34.289
- Uh, you know, I'm supposed to
be all wound up about Suzanna,

09:34.340 --> 09:38.163
but I'm just finding my thoughts
drifting to other things.

09:38.210 --> 09:41.805
Like, uh, you.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.006
- Huh!

09:44.050 --> 09:45.006
(Chuckling)

09:45.050 --> 09:46.870
- Well, you saved my life.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.876
- Yeah.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.876
- Or you...

09:48.920 --> 09:50.684
(Sighing)

09:50.720 --> 09:51.915
- (Whispering):
Yeah, what?

09:51.950 --> 09:54.658
- You kissed me, Sally!

09:54.690 --> 09:55.657
- You told me to.

09:55.690 --> 09:56.782
- I didn't tell you to.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.956
- Not you, you.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.049
The you when I got
stuck in the past

10:00.100 --> 10:01.192
for a couple years,

10:01.230 --> 10:03.221
that you,
he told me!

10:03.270 --> 10:05.796
We kind of had a thing.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.696
Like a deep thing.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.162
(Chuckling)

10:09.200 --> 10:11.202
We were in love.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.930
- You... me?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.903
- Me and you, yeah.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.647
That you told me
to kiss this you,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.945
and he swore that
it would make you realize

10:22.990 --> 10:25.243
that you had
feelings for me.

10:27.390 --> 10:31.258
So did you?
Did you feel anything?

10:31.290 --> 10:34.055
-1, um...

10:34.100 --> 10:36.057
I did. I did!

10:36.100 --> 10:38.091
I did, OK? I--

10:38.130 --> 10:40.963
Well, it's not like we can
do anything about it, right?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.959
I mean, look,
there's attraction.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.830
- Yeah.

10:46.880 --> 10:51.249
- But I'm old enough to know
that that can't be everything.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.942
I don't know if I wanna
risk the friendship.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.209
- No, I know. Me too.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.116
- Besides, all our
relationships end

10:57.150 --> 10:58.686
- In massive
disasters anyway.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.711
- Well, mostly you,
but yeah.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.388
- Yeah, and that's what
I'm talking about, Sally.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.127
I don't want us to end up
a massive disaster.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.423
- Oh my God!
Me neither!

11:07.460 --> 11:09.861
That's not
what I want.

11:13.170 --> 11:16.140
- (Kenny): You're not
giving me a chancel!

11:16.170 --> 11:17.365
- Why are you doing this?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.401
- Look, it's because
I love you, Astrid!

11:19.440 --> 11:22.410
Listen, listen. This is the
best way for us to be together.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.977
You know that.
Why don't you want this?

11:25.010 --> 11:26.375
- I don't know
what I want!

11:26.410 --> 11:28.845
Can we just think
about it some more?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.109
(Scoffing)

11:30.150 --> 11:33.313
- Um, sorry. I can come
back later if you, uh...

11:33.360 --> 11:35.988
- No. We're done here.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.285
Um, is Josh all right?

11:39.330 --> 11:41.856
- He will be.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.698
- OK.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.932
- Don't tell me you're
blowing it with her!

11:50.970 --> 11:53.177
Kenny, she's really
good for you.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.429
- I know. That's
why I called you.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.743
I need your help.

11:56.780 --> 11:57.747
- Yeah!

11:57.780 --> 11:59.009
- I wanna disappear.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.075
- Look, you're doing
a good job.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.919
You established a peace
between us and the werewolves.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.816
That's unprecedented.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.057
- Oh, yeah, that's
been really popular.

12:08.090 --> 12:10.457
Aidan, I'm 17 years old.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.925
17!

12:12.960 --> 12:15.793
I mean, do you even
remember what that was like?

12:15.830 --> 12:18.424
I wanna live a life.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.292
I wanna have
a life with Astrid.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.168
- If you've got
enemies, real enemies,

12:26.210 --> 12:29.202
then running away ain't
gonna accomplish anything.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.846
They'll find you,
and they'll find Astrid,

12:31.880 --> 12:33.473
so what you really need to do...

12:33.520 --> 12:34.942
We could fake your death.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.345
- How would I do that?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.041
- Very simple.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.912
OK, first, we get our hands
on some vampire ashes, OK?

12:40.960 --> 12:41.916
So call a meeting.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.519
You get everyone
underneath you

12:43.560 --> 12:45.119
in the pecking
order who...

12:45.160 --> 12:48.460
Those are the ones that
want you dead the most, right?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.195
- Right.
- Call that meeting.

12:50.230 --> 12:53.097
Bring them all into here,
your office, this room,

12:53.140 --> 12:56.804
and I'm standing there with a
stake, maybe some blood on it.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.502
I'm huffing and puffing.
I'm brooding. It's brilliant.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.235
And there are ashes at my feet.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.204
And as far as they're concerned,
those are your ashes.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.399
That simple.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.976
- You really thing they're
gonna buy that story?

13:08.020 --> 13:10.842
- Oh, the beauty of it is that
they're gonna wanna buy it.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.517
And they're gonna be
so busy scheming

13:12.550 --> 13:15.110
and taking each other out
to fill the power vacuum,

13:15.160 --> 13:18.130
they're gonna forget all about
me and, more importantly, you.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.252
- (Whispering): Fine.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.496
- What was that?

13:20.530 --> 13:21.827
- Yeah.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.396
- Yes, is that right?
- I'll do it.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.228
- That's what I'm
talking about!

13:25.270 --> 13:27.830
- Let's kill me.
- Let's kill you. All right.

13:27.870 --> 13:30.259
I'm just gonna need
help with Astrid.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.233
She doesn't think
she can leave.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.137
Somebody's gotta present
a pretty clear case to her.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.274
- Kenny, she's not
gonna listen to me!

13:37.310 --> 13:39.039
- Well, if not you...
Josh, Nora?

13:39.080 --> 13:42.050
"Cause Astrid respects them,
and they'll listen to you.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.539
- You're a smart kid.
A real smart kid.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.149
- (Josh):
No, thanks!

13:50.190 --> 13:52.284
- What exactly do
you mean, "no, thanks"?

13:52.330 --> 13:54.389
- No, thanks. It's a
polite way of me saying

13:54.430 --> 13:56.194
that I don't really
wanna get involved

13:56.230 --> 13:58.392
in a vampire-werewolf
star-crossed love affair.

13:58.430 --> 14:00.159
- I'm not asking you
to get involved.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.032
I'm asking you to
have a conversation.

14:02.070 --> 14:05.301
Astrid deserves a better shot
than to be stuck with that pack.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.604
- She's not stuck, though.
She's not a child!

14:07.640 --> 14:09.039
And she's not stupid.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.174
I mean, she's choosing
to be there with them.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.417
- I understand that,
but look, she's scared,

14:13.450 --> 14:15.942
and it's hard to pull away,
and I've been there.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.449
As horrible as Mark and
that pack of lunatics are,

14:18.490 --> 14:19.912
it's all she's ever known.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.916
It's her family.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.416
- Exactly!
It's her family.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.179
I just don't think that
they would hurt her.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.050
- What? Josh,
look at my face!

14:27.100 --> 14:28.898
And what about what
they did to you?

14:28.930 --> 14:31.592
They drove you wild, they made
you turn a bunch of people.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.190
- I know! I know
exactly what they did!

14:34.240 --> 14:37.062
But as twisted as
this sounds, I get it.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.239
I don't forgive them.
I'm just saying I understand.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.078
I understand.
They're scared.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.204
They don't know
how long this truce

14:44.250 --> 14:46.469
between the werewolves
and the vampires

14:46.510 --> 14:49.070
will last till the
persecution is back on.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.215
- Wait a second. So this
is about vampires, is it?

14:52.250 --> 14:54.617
- It's about Kenny.
We started talking about Kenny.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.049
- So it's about Kenny,
and Kenny is a good kid.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.388
- Yeah, he's a kid, though!
He's a hot-blooded kid!

14:59.430 --> 15:00.625
So Astrid goes with him,

15:00.660 --> 15:03.095
they get across the country,
and he bails on her.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.359
- He's not gonna bail!

15:04.400 --> 15:05.663
- Or they get
into a fight.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.464
And they're bound to.
They're kids!

15:07.500 --> 15:10.106
And he kills her!
- Wow!

15:10.140 --> 15:11.960
- I don't want
that on my conscience.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.500
- What are you guys
talking about?

15:13.540 --> 15:15.929
- Glad you're here,
because Josh was telling me

15:15.980 --> 15:18.074
how he really feels about
vampires, about me.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.249
- That's not fair...
- We're not to be trusted.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.271
- This has nothing
to do with you.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.243
- It's about my son,
so it does.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.009
- And you want to do
anything for him.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.516
- Yes, I would!
- OK, OK!

15:28.560 --> 15:30.153
- That's the
only reason?

15:30.190 --> 15:31.658
- What else would
it be about?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.159
- Sally said you were
throwing out your past.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.429
- Is that right?

15:35.460 --> 15:37.394
- I didn't say
it was a bad thing.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.296
- If you're trying
to cut all your ties,

15:39.330 --> 15:42.391
why don't you cut Kenny
loose and be totally free?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.431
- Why don't I just
abandon my son?

15:44.470 --> 15:46.529
Let's talk about a man

15:46.570 --> 15:49.540
who has a psychopathic dog
that lurks under the surface.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.571
- Aidan!
- And instead of seeking help...

15:51.610 --> 15:52.702
- Be careful, man.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.242
- ...he blames
everything on the wolf.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.148
He says: "It's the wolf's fault
that I've wrecked my marriage,

15:59.190 --> 16:01.318
"that I put my friends
in constant danger."

16:01.360 --> 16:04.557
- It's everything I can do to
keep it just below the surface.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.285
- Really? That's
very exciting.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.549
- Both of you, stop now!
Enough! Come on!

16:08.600 --> 16:11.126
Can we step down
a bit, please?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.592
(Sighing)

16:15.570 --> 16:17.334
- You know what?
She's right.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.702
Let's take a step back.
Let's cut all of our ties.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.072
Maybe this little
experiment is at an end.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.272
- (Josh): Might be
the smart thing to do.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.699
- Stop saying it's an
experiment! It's a friendship!

16:26.750 --> 16:28.479
I'm sick of both of you
saying that!

16:28.520 --> 16:31.319
It's a friendship that saved
all of us countless times!

16:31.350 --> 16:33.352
We have to get out of here.

16:33.390 --> 16:36.087
- No, you can't go.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.680
- Who are you?

16:38.730 --> 16:41.324
- My name is Ramona.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.362
Please don't leave me.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.508
- Ramona, where do you
come from?

16:53.540 --> 16:55.099
- Here.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.450
- Here? Meaning,
um, this house?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.448
- This room.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.516
- Um, did you live here
with anybody?

17:06.550 --> 17:10.782
- My mom, my dad, Bea.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.286
- Beatrice.

17:12.329 --> 17:13.752
Is that your sister?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.154
- My twin.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.464
That means we're
better than sisters.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.662
I need Beatrice.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.307
She knows more than I do.
She talks to people.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.604
- How long have you been
in this room, Ramona?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.438
- I'm always here.

17:27.480 --> 17:32.202
I've heard you guys
for a long time now.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.412
I've liked all
your voices,

17:34.450 --> 17:36.179
I pretended we're
all friends.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.540
(Ramona giggling)

17:37.590 --> 17:41.811
- All this time, you just
wanted to talk to your sister?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.727
Hey, it's OK. Do you want
us to find Bea for you?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.489
- Would you do that?
Will you?

17:47.730 --> 17:50.222
- OK.

17:52.570 --> 17:56.837
- (Automated voice): Number C526
proceed to counter 15.

17:56.870 --> 17:59.100
- We're gonna be here
for a while.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.337
- It's OK, whatever.
We can work on our spiel.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.246
- Or we can have time
to talk about

18:04.280 --> 18:06.374
how this is a very
bad idea. Terrible.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.447
- Aidan, come on!
Like, we have to do this.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.709
You saw that
little girl.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.616
- Yes, I saw that
girl, and so did you.

18:11.650 --> 18:14.256
But Beatrice can't, so how's
that gonna look, huh?

18:14.290 --> 18:15.815
"Hi, nice to meet you.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.624
"Just met your dead sister

18:17.660 --> 18:20.652
"who was, you know,
a ghost and still a child."

18:20.700 --> 18:24.227
- Look, I don't wanna do this
any more than you do.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.863
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

18:25.900 --> 18:27.629
- Yes, you do.
- I do not!

18:27.670 --> 18:30.560
There's something in me that
needs to reconnect these two.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.635
If Ramona can
see Beatrice,

18:32.670 --> 18:34.479
maybe she can give
her a message.

18:34.510 --> 18:38.549
She can get closure. Maybe
that'll help her get her door.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.447
Maybe if I help, it'll bring
me closer to getting my door.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.609
- Wait a second. Hold on.
This is about getting your door?

18:44.650 --> 18:46.641
- I have to get back
on track, right?

18:46.690 --> 18:50.422
"Cause there's nothing
here for me, right?

18:50.460 --> 18:54.328
There's more to it than
chemistry and attraction, right?

18:54.360 --> 18:58.570
And I wouldn't want this
to end in a massive disaster.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.535
- It wouldn't have to be
a massive disaster,

19:01.570 --> 19:04.403
if we just, you know,
took our time, right,

19:04.440 --> 19:06.169
and explored
our feelings.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.304
Maybe something
like that, right?

19:08.340 --> 19:09.307
- Wow! Hmm!

19:09.340 --> 19:10.307
Guess what?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.306
- What?

19:11.350 --> 19:12.579
- You're an ass!

19:12.610 --> 19:13.611
- I'm an ass?

19:13.650 --> 19:15.243
- You're an ass.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.715
- Oh, no. I wanna hear this.
How am I an ass?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.309
- Because this morning,

19:19.350 --> 19:21.557
you were throwing your life
into garbage bags,

19:21.590 --> 19:22.910
saying that you need a change,

19:22.960 --> 19:24.849
and then we have this moment,

19:24.890 --> 19:27.825
and you completely blow it up,
which is fine.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.363
Right now, you're
pulling me back in!

19:30.400 --> 19:32.198
You, sir,
are a drama queen.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.300
- Don't call me that.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.489
- You're a drama queen.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.360
You can't have
anything with anyone

19:36.400 --> 19:38.767
without this weird, sad,
twisty-turny story.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.905
- Look, listen to me. Everything
that I said was 100% logical,

19:41.940 --> 19:43.647
but logic, it goes
out the window

19:43.680 --> 19:45.944
when your heart
becomes involved,

19:45.980 --> 19:49.575
and then you just wanna, like,
grab someone and hold onto them.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.588
- Is your heart involved?

20:05.830 --> 20:09.892
If we're gonna do this, then
you really can't jerk me around.

20:09.940 --> 20:11.533
You know that, right?

20:11.570 --> 20:14.403
- Yeah, absolutely. No more
jerking, just exploring.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.377
No more jerking, just exploring.
Deal with it!

20:18.410 --> 20:20.617
This guy knows.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.380
- Where did Nora go?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.781
- She went to
her own place.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.259
- I don't think
you're scary,

20:32.290 --> 20:34.759
even if you do have
a monster inside you.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.859
- How did you
know that?

20:36.900 --> 20:39.619
- I told you. All there was
to do in there was listen.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.298
You're gonna be lonely.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.604
You should stay
here with me.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.002
- Nora's here.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.475
(Door opening)

20:52.980 --> 20:54.812
(Sighing)

21:00.460 --> 21:02.417
- Nora... How did
you do that?

21:02.460 --> 21:03.621
(Chuckling)

21:03.660 --> 21:05.981
This is Ramona.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.727
- Hi, Ramona!
Where did you come from?

21:08.760 --> 21:11.991
- That charming yet creepy room
with the bloodstained floor

21:12.030 --> 21:14.567
that we discovered
this morning, it's, um...

21:14.600 --> 21:15.829
- I lived there.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.929
- Yeah, a long,
long time ago.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.337
- Oh my!

21:20.380 --> 21:23.031
- Mm-hmm, and Aidan
and Sally are out right now,

21:23.080 --> 21:27.005
searching for her sister,
Beatrice, for some help.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.519
Hopefully, they'll
be back super soon.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.416
- Well, it's nice
to meet you!

21:31.450 --> 21:34.283
- Uh, Ramona, could you
give us a minute?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.682
Thank you.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.982
(Sighing)

21:39.030 --> 21:40.919
- She was in that
room this entire time?

21:40.960 --> 21:41.927
- Longer, yeah.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.428
- Oh my God!

21:43.470 --> 21:45.063
- When we bashed
through the wall,

21:45.100 --> 21:47.023
we must have
freed her somehow.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.367
- How?
- I don't know.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.367
- Magic? Oh my God!

21:49.400 --> 21:50.629
Why was she in there?

21:50.670 --> 21:52.536
- I don't know!
Intense ghost denial.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.937
Why was Sally trapped
in the house forever?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.573
Maybe it's the same thing.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.578
The whole thing makes
my head hurt bad,

21:58.610 --> 22:00.942
and I haven't even
packed up the kitchen yet.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.347
I don't know.
I'm freaking out.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.017
Why are you here?

22:05.050 --> 22:07.712
Are you here to turn
with me tonight?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.650
- No! No, I came
to talk to Astrid.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.021
Didn't Aidan
talk to you?

22:12.060 --> 22:13.619
- Yeah, he did.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.027
I told him I wasn't interested.
- Why not?

22:16.060 --> 22:18.597
- Because, although
I'm not a fan of the pack,

22:18.630 --> 22:21.429
they may be a better alternative
than her running away

22:21.470 --> 22:23.131
<i>- With a volatile
mind-warping vampire,.</i>

22:23.170 --> 22:25.662
- So you trust Mark,
but not Kenny?

22:25.710 --> 22:28.509
- No, they protect their own,
though. You know that.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.577
- When they're not
locking them in cages

22:30.610 --> 22:32.374
and poking them
with cattle prods.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.617
- That's why I don't
wanna change alone.

22:34.650 --> 22:37.517
I'm scared. It would feel
safer if you were there.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.987
- Do you hear what
you're saying right now?

22:41.020 --> 22:42.909
There was a time

22:42.960 --> 22:45.657
when you used to do
everything in your power

22:45.690 --> 22:48.591
to make sure that you
kept me away from danger,

22:48.630 --> 22:50.724
and now you're trying
to pull me in.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.592
- No! No, I'm not trying to
pull you into anything.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.096
That's not what
this is about.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.892
(Doorbell buzzing)

22:56.940 --> 22:59.568
Listen, I can't--I can't deal
with this right now.

22:59.610 --> 23:03.069
If you think this is what's best
for Astrid, then be my guest,

23:03.110 --> 23:04.999
but I--I'm sorry.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.870
(Doorbell buzzing)

23:06.910 --> 23:08.810
I'm gonna go pack.

23:14.860 --> 23:15.816
- Hi!

23:15.860 --> 23:16.816
- Hey.

23:16.860 --> 23:17.930
- Come on in!

23:17.960 --> 23:19.155
- Is Josh here?

23:19.190 --> 23:21.090
- Yeah, he's upstairs.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.861
Uh, but I think just
the two of us should talk.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.461
But can I get you
something to drink?

23:27.500 --> 23:28.831
Water or--

23:30.070 --> 23:32.710
What are you doing?

23:34.240 --> 23:37.505
- She's doing what's
best for everyone.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.109
- Josh!

23:39.150 --> 23:41.949
What the hell is that?

23:45.250 --> 23:47.082
Nora!

23:47.120 --> 23:48.781
- I can't let you out.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.023
- What?

23:52.060 --> 23:53.949
Are you doing this?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.856
- Sorry, I can't let you go
down there. It's not safe!

23:56.900 --> 23:58.197
- Ramona, you let me out.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.119
Let me out of this
room right now!

24:00.170 --> 24:02.889
You don't know what
they're capable of!

24:02.940 --> 24:05.739
- I know they're bad, and you
can't fight them like this!

24:05.770 --> 24:08.569
(Roaring)

24:08.610 --> 24:10.009
- Open the door!

24:12.150 --> 24:15.745
(Groaning)

24:25.260 --> 24:27.797
- (Mark): Once he sees us,
he'll come around.

24:27.830 --> 24:29.491
- What if he doesn't?

24:29.530 --> 24:32.022
- Come on, Josh!
You can come out.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.237
Josh, buddy?

24:37.270 --> 24:38.760
Nora's fine.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.973
We feel really bad
for the way things went down,

24:42.010 --> 24:45.503
and we've got something
to show you.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.109
It's OK.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.984
Josh, open the door.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.727
(Growling)

24:59.060 --> 25:01.654
You've done something great.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.021
It's OK.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.528
But she needs your help.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.868
She needs you
to teach her.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.159
(Snarling)

25:12.210 --> 25:15.077
Josh? Josh, wait.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.543
Proceed to counter 5.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.842
- Yes!

25:25.890 --> 25:28.860
- Please try not
to distract me, OK?

25:28.890 --> 25:29.982
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.249
Can I help you?

25:31.290 --> 25:32.985
- Say: "No, but
I can help you."

25:33.030 --> 25:34.589
- No, but I can help you.

25:34.630 --> 25:37.224
- Excuse me? Are you here
to renew your permit?

25:37.260 --> 25:39.729
- No, I'm here to renew
your love for your sister.

25:39.770 --> 25:41.590
No, don't say that!
That's really bad!

25:41.640 --> 25:43.165
- You're Beatrice
Bensen, right?

25:43.200 --> 25:44.599
- Good.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.267
- I am.

25:46.310 --> 25:48.836
- Well, this is awkward,
um, crazy, in fact.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.577
Beatrice, I am here to
say things to your face.

25:51.610 --> 25:52.748
- OK, I'm sorry--

25:52.780 --> 25:54.145
- Things that will
make you think

25:54.180 --> 25:56.274
that I am a
disturbed person.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.585
Um, I'm here to talk
to you about your sister.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.758
- My sister!

26:00.790 --> 26:03.282
You must be mistaken.
I don't have a sister.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.754
- Am I mistaken?

26:04.790 --> 26:07.020
- No, I did my homework.
This is her.

26:07.060 --> 26:09.859
- I'm here to talk
to you about Ramona.

26:11.330 --> 26:15.665
OK, listen, I understand
this might be painful,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.259
but I've seen her.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.632
Uh, well, not her,
exactly. Her, uh...

26:19.670 --> 26:21.172
- Spirit.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.747
- Spirit. And, uh,
she's in my house.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.771
I'm just gonna start
from the beginning.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.313
There's this room, it is
hidden behind a closet...

26:28.350 --> 26:30.887
- Saw this guy talking
to himself earlier,

26:30.920 --> 26:32.046
a real jabber-jaw.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.286
- ...since you've been
there, and I can see...

26:34.320 --> 26:35.287
- Excuse me, sir.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.879
- ...that you
called security.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.786
- And I get that.
- Here we go.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.925
- Come to my house and see
for yourself. Believe me.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.792
- I don't know why
you're doing this,

26:43.830 --> 26:46.800
but if you ever come back here
and harass with this nonsense,

26:46.830 --> 26:49.800
I'll have you arrested.
- Is there a problem?

26:49.840 --> 26:52.662
- This man is causing a
disturbance, speaking gibberish.

26:52.710 --> 26:53.905
(Laughing)

26:53.940 --> 26:55.203
- Could you
come with us?

26:55.240 --> 26:57.709
- I know I'm invisible,
but still mortifying!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.070
- Ramona loves you!

26:59.110 --> 27:02.114
She needs to see you!
She's waiting!

27:02.150 --> 27:03.220
All right, guys.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.649
(Sally groaning)

27:04.690 --> 27:06.840
- For what it's worth,
I was impressed.

27:06.890 --> 27:10.679
You've had to speak while being
dragged away a lot, haven't you?

27:10.730 --> 27:11.788
(Laughing)

27:11.830 --> 27:13.696
- Look, I just feel bad
for the kid.

27:13.730 --> 27:16.097
I really don't know
what the next move is.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.164
- (Whispering):
Oh my God!

27:28.440 --> 27:30.238
- What happened here?

27:34.850 --> 27:36.409
- They came for him.

27:36.450 --> 27:38.839
I let Astrid in,

27:38.890 --> 27:40.858
and she had a gun.

27:40.890 --> 27:43.382
Then they all followed.

27:43.420 --> 27:46.720
He did this
to protect me.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.990
(Exhaling sharply)

27:51.270 --> 27:52.760
- Astrid!

27:55.040 --> 27:57.395
- She didn't
wanna do it.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.877
I told her to run
when I heard Josh coming.

28:01.910 --> 28:05.005
She wasn't fast enough.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.839
- She wouldn't let me
out of the room.

28:08.880 --> 28:13.852
Ramona. She wouldn't
let me out until I changed.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.280
- Oh God! This is
all my fault.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.456
The spell,

28:19.490 --> 28:21.049
I should've
finished it.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.296
- No, stop!
No time for that.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.389
Come on. Everything's
gonna be OK.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.125
- He's gonna
change again soon.

28:27.170 --> 28:28.194
- Yeah, I know.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.435
- We both are.

28:29.470 --> 28:32.064
- Then go.
I'll clean up.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.452
- What are
we doing here?

28:48.490 --> 28:50.288
- We need a place
to change.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.823
- No, I mean,
what are we doing here?

28:52.860 --> 28:56.091
- Because I needed a place
where Nora can lock herself up.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.191
The shed. I need you both
to be safe right now.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.198
- Sally, what are you--
Why are you here?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.038
- Because I'm gonna
try to help you.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.037
- No! No more magic!

29:04.070 --> 29:06.209
- I'm not using magic.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.334
I'm gonna go inside you
through possession.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.940
I know, it's
a terrible idea,

29:10.980 --> 29:12.846
but we don't have
any other choice!

29:12.880 --> 29:15.315
We're desperate right now.

29:15.350 --> 29:18.479
I don't wanna find out if it
gets any worse than this, Josh.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.215
So we do this, OK?
We do this.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.981
(Sighing)

29:28.400 --> 29:29.458
- I love you.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.820
- I love you.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.326
- So much.

29:37.270 --> 29:39.329
- Nora?

29:39.370 --> 29:41.236
- I'll go.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.372
- I love you.

29:42.410 --> 29:43.809
- I love you.

29:43.850 --> 29:44.942
- Go fast.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.276
OK!
- All right.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.515
- What now?

29:49.550 --> 29:52.144
- I'm gonna poke
inside your brain.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.158
- All right,
so what do I--

29:54.190 --> 29:55.555
(Groaning, panting)

29:55.590 --> 29:57.410
It's happening.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.427
- Yeah.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.087
- We need to
do this now.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.097
- OK.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.529
- What's next?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.892
- The Pete stuff,
the meditation that you do

30:04.930 --> 30:06.420
to connect with
the wolf, do it.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.360
- No, but that's what got me
into this in the first place!

30:09.400 --> 30:12.131
- Josh, I can't argue
right now. I don't have time.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.002
I need to go inside
you, not the wolf.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.974
I need you to focus, OK?

30:16.010 --> 30:17.535
Open up a window for me.

30:17.580 --> 30:21.141
All right. I really
hope this works.

30:22.550 --> 30:23.881
- Oh!

30:23.920 --> 30:25.979
(Panting)

30:26.020 --> 30:28.011
(Groaning)

30:28.060 --> 30:29.585
(Screaming)

30:35.430 --> 30:37.899
Josh!
- Sally?

30:37.930 --> 30:40.160
- Josh! Hey!

30:40.200 --> 30:41.838
Hi!

30:43.600 --> 30:45.068
Hi!

30:45.110 --> 30:46.339
- What are you
doing here?

30:46.370 --> 30:48.907
(Sally gasping)

30:54.450 --> 30:56.179
- I know. We're
gonna make it safe.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.143
- How?

30:58.190 --> 31:01.319
- Josh, the wolf,
it took you over.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.919
And I tried to
get you back,

31:02.960 --> 31:04.928
but I think it just
split you up inside.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.189
That's why
you're in here.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.322
- How do you know that?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.896
- 'Cause it happened to me.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.989
Remember when the reaper
followed me around?

31:11.030 --> 31:13.067
- That was you!
- It was a part of me.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.932
He was trying to
occupy my brain

31:14.970 --> 31:16.597
while he took over
on the outside.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.938
I think that's
what's happening here.

31:18.970 --> 31:22.076
- How do we get
out of here?

31:22.110 --> 31:26.001
- OK, we have to find that
part of you that's missing,

31:26.050 --> 31:27.939
that's gonna make
you you again.

31:27.980 --> 31:30.017
- No, I don't wanna find it.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.018
- Why not?

31:32.050 --> 31:34.883
(Wolf snarling, barking)

31:37.990 --> 31:39.958
- Because that's it.
- OK.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.549
Wait a minute.
- Run!

31:41.600 --> 31:43.694
- (Sally): Josh!

31:43.730 --> 31:46.620
- (Kenny): What the hell, Aidan?
Did you do this?

31:46.670 --> 31:49.037
- No, I didn't,
Kenny. Josh did.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.629
(Gasping)

31:50.670 --> 31:52.638
They came after
him, and Josh--

31:52.670 --> 31:54.308
- Astrid! Where's Astrid?

31:54.340 --> 31:57.071
- She's-- Kenny,
she's not here!

31:57.110 --> 31:58.600
Come on.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.478
- OK.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.182
No, of course she's not.

32:04.220 --> 32:05.710
She wouldn't, uh...

32:05.750 --> 32:08.356
She wouldn't get involved
in something like this.

32:08.390 --> 32:10.119
- Gary, go get more bags.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.355
The big ones.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.689
- What? What happened?

32:23.170 --> 32:24.535
Where's Astrid?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.503
- She's dead.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.103
She told Mark
and the rest of them

32:32.150 --> 32:33.572
that she was
leaving with you.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.514
Mark didn't like that.

32:37.650 --> 32:39.709
She fought them,

32:40.790 --> 32:42.986
and then they, uh,

32:43.020 --> 32:44.988
came for Josh.

32:49.530 --> 32:51.726
I'm so sorry, Kenny.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.559
- I don't know what to say.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.638
I don't even know how to feel.
I don't know what to do.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.570
- Yes you do.

33:04.450 --> 33:08.045
Leave. Leave Boston.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.276
You get away
from all of this.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.311
- I can't think
about that right now.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.057
- I get it.

33:14.090 --> 33:16.286
But do you remember
the first time

33:16.320 --> 33:19.722
that you talked to me
about running away?

33:19.760 --> 33:22.320
You said that
you were only 17

33:22.360 --> 33:26.319
and that you wanted to
get out and experience things,

33:26.370 --> 33:27.667
have a life.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.192
Kenny, this isn't the stuff

33:30.240 --> 33:33.335
that a 17-year-old
should be experiencing.

33:33.370 --> 33:37.102
This isn't the life that
you were supposed to have.

33:39.610 --> 33:44.081
So you should leave
all of this behind

33:44.120 --> 33:46.043
and go.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.740
(Sniffling)

33:51.630 --> 33:54.053
Astrid would've
wanted that for you.

34:09.409 --> 34:12.208
- Where are we running?
- (Josh): Nowhere!

34:12.250 --> 34:15.469
I just keep running until
it's not there, and then I hide.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.184
- This is what you've been
doing this entire time?

34:19.219 --> 34:21.484
Josh! Josh, stop!

34:21.520 --> 34:24.181
- No! I can't stop, OK?
It's still coming!

34:24.230 --> 34:26.085
- Stop! We have to
confront this thing!

34:26.130 --> 34:28.621
- No! I have, I've been
fighting it for months!

34:28.659 --> 34:31.766
- You've just been running!
- And hiding, yeah.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.770
- You need to stop running
and hiding. You have to stop--

34:34.800 --> 34:37.235
- No, I can't! We have
to go! It's not safe!

34:37.270 --> 34:39.500
- It can be safe!
We can make it safe again!

34:39.540 --> 34:40.803
You are stronger
than this.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.480
We can do this, OK?

34:43.510 --> 34:46.400
Think of a safe place.
Think of a safe place, OK?

34:46.449 --> 34:47.645
You can do it!

34:47.679 --> 34:49.545
Focus on it!

34:49.580 --> 34:51.309
Focus!

34:58.190 --> 35:00.124
(Exhales sharply)

35:03.860 --> 35:06.522
- I'm home!
- (Sally): Almost. Yeah.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.468
- Oh God!

35:10.470 --> 35:12.199
Thank you!

35:15.940 --> 35:17.101
- Don't thank me yet.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.778
- He found me!

35:21.820 --> 35:23.572
(Wolf growling)

35:23.620 --> 35:25.179
He always finds me!

35:25.220 --> 35:26.847
(Snarling, barking)

35:29.220 --> 35:31.154
I brought it here!
I'm so, so sorry!

35:31.190 --> 35:33.921
- You know exactly what to do.
- No, I can't fight him!

35:33.960 --> 35:35.257
He always wins!

35:35.300 --> 35:36.426
- That's the problem!

35:36.460 --> 35:38.360
You can't fight him.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.859
Confrontation is standing up,

35:41.900 --> 35:44.562
looking something in
the eye and being honest.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.170
- I don't know how to do that.
- Yes you do.

35:47.210 --> 35:48.678
Look at me.
Look at me, Josh.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.599
Look at me.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.301
You are that wolf.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.573
You are that wolf.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.881
And we need you.
We need you to come back to us.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.457
OK? Please come back to us.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.726
You have to do this!

36:08.230 --> 36:09.356
Do it!

36:09.400 --> 36:11.391
- Stop!

36:24.780 --> 36:26.509
I am the wolf.

36:27.910 --> 36:29.344
(Screaming)

36:29.380 --> 36:30.939
(Snarling)

36:32.950 --> 36:35.385
And you are me.

36:35.420 --> 36:37.514
(Moaning)

36:37.560 --> 36:40.359
We're together
through everything.

36:40.390 --> 36:43.223
But it's my life

36:44.430 --> 36:46.899
until the moon is full.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.866
(Sighs)

37:38.020 --> 37:42.412
(* Man singing soft rock,
lyrics indistinct *)

37:57.040 --> 38:01.602
** Waiting to resolve

38:01.640 --> 38:05.599
* And waiting for
a sign to prove... *

38:05.650 --> 38:07.505
You're
you!

38:09.120 --> 38:10.576
(Sighs)

38:16.390 --> 38:19.826
* Still we don't know time

38:19.860 --> 38:24.627
* Tell me, baby, is it now?

38:30.900 --> 38:34.734
* I'm afraid of nothing

38:34.780 --> 38:39.342
* And nothing is afraid of me

38:42.950 --> 38:47.581
* Until we're safe and sorry

38:47.620 --> 38:50.749
* We're sorry and safe *

39:30.730 --> 39:32.425
- You're good at this.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.962
- Ramona, you shouldn't be
watching this.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.861
- Why didn't you let
the other men take her?

39:39.870 --> 39:41.406
Is she special?

39:44.710 --> 39:46.075
- Yeah.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.674
Yeah. She's
really special.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.144
(Sighing)

39:54.220 --> 39:56.086
You should go.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.119
- What!

40:34.160 --> 40:35.992
How did you do this?

40:36.030 --> 40:37.657
How'd you get
it this clean?

40:37.700 --> 40:38.895
- I had help.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.489
- Oh God! Kenny!

40:41.540 --> 40:43.099
Did he see Astrid?

40:43.140 --> 40:45.734
- Astrid was not here
when he showed up.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.659
And Astrid was never here,

40:47.710 --> 40:50.099
because she was
killed by the pack.

40:50.140 --> 40:53.178
- That's what you told him?
- That's what he had to hear.

40:53.210 --> 40:55.975
If he'd stuck around,
he would've figured it out.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.739
It would've wrecked everything
for all of us.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.645
- You lied for me.

41:00.690 --> 41:02.249
- I cleaned up.

41:02.290 --> 41:07.023
I mean, that's what we do
in this, um, experiment.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.150
- Thank you!

41:16.070 --> 41:18.835
- You all right?
You OK?

41:18.870 --> 41:20.599
- For now.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.938
This is never
gonna happen again.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.108
This can never
happen again.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.642
- I think that's
really up to you.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.841
You're always gonna
have to go inside.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.520
You're always gonna
have to go and confront

41:33.550 --> 41:35.484
that other half of you.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.536
- (Astrid): Kenny!

41:50.900 --> 41:52.834
- Astrid?

41:52.870 --> 41:54.702
(Panting)

41:54.740 --> 41:56.708
Oh God! Astrid!

41:56.740 --> 41:59.050
(Whooshing, Kenny gasping)

41:59.080 --> 42:00.775
- Sorry.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.118
(Sobbing): I ruined
everything for us.

42:04.150 --> 42:05.982
- No, no, no.
Hey, it's fine.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.955
It's not your
fault, I promise!

42:08.990 --> 42:10.788
- I didn't have a choice.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.152
They found out
we were leaving

42:13.190 --> 42:15.056
and they made me
help them first.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.989
- Help them?

42:18.200 --> 42:20.020
- I took them to Josh...

42:20.070 --> 42:22.198
(Gasps)

42:22.240 --> 42:24.129
...but he turned on them.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.069
- Josh did this to you?

42:27.110 --> 42:29.829
- I heard the screaming
and I tried to run,

42:29.880 --> 42:31.006
but it was too fast.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.003
