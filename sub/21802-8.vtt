[creaking]

00:30.300 --> 00:32.299
[creaking continues]

00:47.140 --> 00:51.820
Why would a smart girl like you
stick her nose in other people's business?

00:51.900 --> 00:54.540
[Brooke] Daniel! Daniel, wake up!

00:55.140 --> 00:56.260
[screams]

00:56.340 --> 00:58.780
[gasps and pants]

01:10.620 --> 01:11.700
[sighs]

01:30.300 --> 01:32.300
[theme music playing]

01:54.460 --> 01:55.780
[Marcus] This is the plan.

01:55.860 --> 02:00.420
All I need from you is a one-second window
to hack their servers.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.860
[sighs] Who else knows about this?

02:08.419 --> 02:10.660
I wish I could tell you
all the details, Jason.

02:10.740 --> 02:14.540
But what I can say is that
our world will be a lot safer...

02:15.820 --> 02:16.940
thanks to your efforts.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.460
Now, are you sure you know what to do?

02:32.580 --> 02:34.580
Jason, you can do this.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.260
Now, go.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.540
God help us.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.620
[clicks tongue] Wonder if they'll let us
watch the launch from the control room.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.140
Yeah, probably not.
[sighs] Probably not.

03:11.260 --> 03:13.700
So, we're gonna be stuck in a car
with Jason for, like, an hour.

03:13.780 --> 03:15.620
I mean, I hate the smell
of his aftershave, you know?

03:15.700 --> 03:17.300
[Jackie] Hey, pretty lady.

03:18.220 --> 03:20.340
Thought you could use a snack
for the trip.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.140
- Chocolate chip cookies. Yay!
- [chuckles]

03:24.220 --> 03:28.500
You guys are so lucky.
I'd give anything to see the launch today.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.340
Alex refused to go.
Want my ticket for free?

03:31.420 --> 03:33.220
Absolutely not.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.220
Hayley's NASA's guest of honor
because of her mother.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.780
- [whispering] This is gonna be torture.
- You'll be fine.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.060
Come on. Car's outside.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.820
I see her in my dreams now.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.780
- [scoffs] Brooke, you have to relax.
- I can't.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.460
Look, I know this woman
did something to this car.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.420
Yeah, well, this woman is Daniel's mother.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.860
Exactly. Soph, I worry about him.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.580
God, you're so stressed out.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.500
You have to stop worrying about this.

04:05.220 --> 04:06.420
You should listen to your captain.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.220
[chuckles] That's right.
It's your first day as captain,

04:10.300 --> 04:12.420
and I'm here with my conspiracy theories.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.260
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.980
Mmm, hey...

04:17.060 --> 04:22.019
And as your captain, I order you to
stop obsessing over Daniel's mother.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.380
- Okay?
- Aye aye, Captain.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.420
- Good.
- [laughs]

04:30.620 --> 04:31.620
[Louie chimes]

04:31.700 --> 04:35.900
Search for
"What causes a car engine fire?"

04:43.820 --> 04:45.060
Morning.

04:45.820 --> 04:46.780
Hey!

04:47.780 --> 04:50.620
How's your leg?
Did you sleep okay?

04:51.260 --> 04:54.580
- You just can't let it go, can you?
- I just wanna know what happened.

05:01.180 --> 05:07.020
[man on TV] Launched in September,
GOWS-11 is the first in a series

05:07.100 --> 05:11.340
of next-generation
geostationary weather satellites...

05:11.420 --> 05:12.820
[continues indistinctly]

05:25.380 --> 05:27.580
- Emma?
- Hmm?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.140
What? Oh. [coughs] Nothing.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.380
[inhales deeply]

05:39.860 --> 05:42.220
What are you doing?
You're blowing your chance.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.540
What chance?

05:44.220 --> 05:47.300
To ask you-know-who out on a date.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.580
- [sighs]
- Come on,

05:48.660 --> 05:50.740
both of you guys
love this astronaut stuff.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.140
Actually, it's an unmanned mission,
so there...

05:52.220 --> 05:54.380
Max... focus.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.900
All I'm saying is that both of you
are into this unmanned nonsense.

05:57.980 --> 06:01.460
This is your golden opportunity
to have some quality time with her.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.940
Yeah, but everyone's gonna be
watching the launch here, so...

06:04.020 --> 06:06.900
I know. Tell her you wanna
watch the launch outside.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.220
The spacecraft is gonna be
flying over the ocean, right?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.180
Make a picnic out of it.

06:12.260 --> 06:15.180
The two of you having a romantic moment,

06:15.260 --> 06:17.580
watching something
you both deeply care about...

06:18.340 --> 06:20.820
moving slowly into the distance.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.460
That's not a bad idea.

06:23.540 --> 06:26.340
But keep it casual.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.980
Not too over the top.
You don't wanna scare her, right?

06:29.060 --> 06:30.900
- Of course.
- Play it cool.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.940
- Okay.
- Be mysterious.

06:34.580 --> 06:37.060
- Mysterious.
- Yeah. Girls like that.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.260
[softly] Mysterious.

06:39.340 --> 06:43.500
And then, at the right moment...
look deep into her eyes and say,

06:43.580 --> 06:44.980
"You have beautiful eyes."

06:46.420 --> 06:48.420
Yeah, she does have beautiful eyes.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.740
[inhales sharply] Roger that.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.380
[sighs]

07:04.580 --> 07:05.420
Hey, Emma.

07:08.020 --> 07:11.380
Why watch the launch on TV
when we could watch it outside?

07:12.220 --> 07:15.100
We're, like, 60 miles away.
It's gonna be impossible to see anything.

07:15.180 --> 07:21.220
Well, I happen to own an 80-millimetre
portable refractor telescope. [sighs]

07:21.300 --> 07:23.220
Whoa! Awesome.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.780
Actually, it has virtually
zero chromatic aberration,

07:25.860 --> 07:28.820
and there's a T-thread adaptor that
I added myself, which is actually, uh...

07:28.900 --> 07:30.420
Anyway, anyway... [clears throat]

07:30.500 --> 07:35.780
Anyway... we could watch it outside,
if you want.

07:35.860 --> 07:36.860
I'd love to.

07:39.900 --> 07:40.980
So that's a yes?

07:42.260 --> 07:43.140
Mmm-hmm.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
Hayley!

07:55.020 --> 07:56.020
Hi.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.180
Look at you, in your Greenhouse uniform.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.580
You look so much like your mother.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.700
Thank you.

08:02.780 --> 08:07.380
- Hi. Leo Cruz.
- Captain of the Ravens. Very impressive.

08:07.460 --> 08:10.700
Jason Osmond, dean of the Greenhouse.
Honor to meet you.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.420
You're Louis' kid.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.100
- So, how is your dad doing?
- He's good. Thank you for asking.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.420
- Good.
- [Jason] So,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.780
since Hayley here
is NASA's guest of honor,

08:19.860 --> 08:22.180
we were hoping for a little
VIP tour around the facility.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.780
Maybe some other time.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.820
I think you can tell
we're a little busy at the moment.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.620
Of course, of course.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.260
Tell Carter I said hi, and Alex, too.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.620
In the meantime, make yourselves at home.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.260
I promise you,
this is the best view in the house.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.260
Thank you.

08:37.340 --> 08:39.179
Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.860
Stay in this area. Anywhere else
is restricted. I'll be right back.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.700
Okay. Good luck in there.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.500
[inhales deeply]

09:25.580 --> 09:26.580
Exciting day, huh?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.220
Go, NASA. [chuckles softly]

09:36.500 --> 09:38.820
This is a restricted area, sir.

09:39.740 --> 09:40.780
Of course.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.500
Hold on one sec.

09:45.940 --> 09:51.340
In 1962, seven years before the first man
walked on the moon,

09:51.420 --> 09:54.140
President Kennedy said,

09:54.220 --> 09:59.740
"We set sail on this new sea because
there is new knowledge to be gained."

09:59.820 --> 10:02.900
- Kennedy did not live to see his dream...
- Hey. You okay?

10:02.980 --> 10:07.380
However, more than 50 years later,
our very own Dr. Ryan Woods

10:08.140 --> 10:11.460
inspired us to set sail
on this vast ocean once again.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.300
Without her work,
this satellite would not exist.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.220
I can't take this pity.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.780
Everyone loved your mother.
He was really glad you came.

10:20.860 --> 10:22.860
Look, it's nice that
they made her into a symbol,

10:22.940 --> 10:24.220
but it's got nothing to do with me.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.460
Mmm.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.060
Yeah, you should take this
to the guest area.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.980
Only authorized personnel
are allowed here.

10:35.060 --> 10:39.500
I'm a VIP guest of Mr. Brandon Thomas.
You... you can call him.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.260
[audience applauds]

10:49.340 --> 10:52.740
So, at this time, when our
newest satellite is ready to launch,

10:52.820 --> 10:57.540
let us all honor this brave woman
who gave her life

10:57.620 --> 11:01.740
so that our country's space program
could continue to progress.

11:01.820 --> 11:06.980
Ryan, if you were here with us today,
I'm sure you would be as excited as I am,

11:07.660 --> 11:10.260
right after you told me
how boring my speech was.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.340
[all laughing]

11:11.420 --> 11:13.500
- Thank God that's over.
- One last thing...

11:14.380 --> 11:17.620
Today, we are honoured to have
Dr. Ryan Woods' daughter here with us.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.300
- [sighs] This can't be happening.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Hayley Woods.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.860
- [all applauding]
- Please, no...

11:23.940 --> 11:27.180
A toast to you and to our new satellite.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.340
Good luck to us all. Thank you.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.740
[sighs] I can't take this anymore.

11:45.860 --> 11:47.260
Hey, hey, hey.
What do you think you're doing?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.900
- Get your hands off me! I'm a VIP guest.
- [alarm blaring]

11:49.980 --> 11:51.860
We got a Code Three.
I'm not gonna need backup.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.500
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the dean of the Greenhouse!

11:54.580 --> 11:57.260
I'm gonna have to escort you out, sir.
You're gonna have to leave.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.420
[line ringing]

12:17.860 --> 12:18.700
Emma?

12:23.540 --> 12:24.740
It's no use.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.140
- No! Gross! No!
- [glass shatters]

12:31.180 --> 12:32.620
That's great.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.420
[indistinct chatter over speakers]

12:45.860 --> 12:46.860
Hi.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.020
Hi.

13:20.620 --> 13:22.460
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:22.540 --> 13:26.220
- [man on TV] Five, four, three...
- It's just a little strange, is all.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.380
...two, one.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.180
- Liftoff.
- [all cheering]

13:42.380 --> 13:44.420
[all applauding]

13:54.620 --> 13:55.860
[Emma] Hey there.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.020
- What?
- You missed the whole thing.

14:04.820 --> 14:07.340
[sighs] Max, I'm so sorry.

14:07.420 --> 14:11.420
[sighs] The showers were occupied
and then the hairdryer stopped working.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.140
I can't believe you did all this.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.700
The pie looked really nice...

14:20.260 --> 14:21.580
before I smashed it.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.340
I feel terrible, Max.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.500
Was it a cool launch?

14:27.940 --> 14:29.180
Yeah.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.220
Great.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.020
You have beautiful eyes.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.180
What?

14:39.100 --> 14:40.740
Not now. In general, I mean.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.740
Now too, of course,
but you can't see them.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.260
Never mind.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.060
So? Is it over?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.540
[indistinct chatter over speakers]

14:52.620 --> 14:53.700
I think so.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.380
Everything seemed to go pretty well.

14:58.340 --> 15:00.660
"This time," you wanted to say.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.980
I can't even imagine what it was like
for you to be here today.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.780
Sorry for not seeing that before.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.340
It's okay. I'm fine, really.

15:18.180 --> 15:21.020
You know, I'm also sorry
for being kind of a jerk to you.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.980
Okay, I was a really big jerk.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.140
Huge. [laughs]

15:32.100 --> 15:35.620
I was just... scared, I think.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.940
Scared of what?

15:41.140 --> 15:42.540
I don't know.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.900
Since the first moment I saw you, I...

15:48.620 --> 15:51.100
- I kind of knew.
- Knew what?

16:04.900 --> 16:06.060
[both chuckle]

16:08.260 --> 16:09.340
[Louie chimes]

16:14.300 --> 16:17.020
- Jason's waiting for us outside.
- Where was he?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.500
Probably got stuck
in a toilet or something.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.140
[laughs] Makes sense.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.460
Hey. Listen to this.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.460
It's just him on the piano.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.380
I thought he only played guitar.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.060
That was Prince, baby.
He could play anything.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.140
Here.

16:59.220 --> 17:03.420
[piano music playing]

17:05.220 --> 17:06.819
It's your move.

17:07.619 --> 17:10.020
- Right.
- [sighs]

17:11.020 --> 17:12.980
- But...
- What?

17:14.140 --> 17:17.300
Your king has, like, no defences.
I can checkmate you in five moves.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.220
[intro music playing]

17:21.420 --> 17:25.220
NASA confirms communication
with the satellite has been cut off.

17:25.900 --> 17:29.180
- Don't change the channel.
- Who cares about a missing satellite?

17:29.260 --> 17:30.260
[reporter] Sources at NASA confirm...

17:30.340 --> 17:32.980
That satellite was launched
in honor of Hayley's mom.

17:33.060 --> 17:36.140
- Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.
- It's okay, Becca.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.660
[reporter] ...Thomas
released a statement

17:37.740 --> 17:41.580
saying he ordered a full investigation
of the causes for this...

17:41.660 --> 17:44.820
I can't believe this.
Emma, did you see the...

17:44.900 --> 17:46.260
[reporter] ...the late Dr. Ryan Woods,

17:46.340 --> 17:49.380
who died last year
in the Athena shuttle explosion.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.900
The failed mission is guaranteed to...
[continues indistinctly]

17:54.300 --> 17:57.780
But how? We were just there.

17:57.860 --> 17:58.980
These things happen.

17:59.060 --> 18:02.740
Be glad it was an unmanned mission
and no lives were lost this time.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.380
[sighs]

18:21.500 --> 18:23.820
- We're linked directly into the satellite.
- [chuckling]

18:23.900 --> 18:27.460
Well done, Jason.
Yeah, I knew you could do it.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.900
Well, you're the genius
who thought this plan out.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.380
Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Stay in this area.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.300
This is a restricted area, sir.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.180
Hold on one sec.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.380
Emma?

18:53.420 --> 18:55.900
Yeah, you should take this
to the guest area.

18:55.980 --> 18:57.740
Only authorized personnel
are allowed here.

18:57.820 --> 19:01.620
I'm a VIP guest of Mr. Brandon Thomas.
You... you can call him.

19:12.260 --> 19:14.100
[rapid beeping]

19:16.500 --> 19:17.700
Hey, hey, hey.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.780
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get your hands off me!

19:45.940 --> 19:47.140
[Emma] Hi there.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.180
[Jason] Diversion was a brilliant idea.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.100
- [chuckles] I didn't think it would work.
- And her friends don't suspect anything?

20:07.180 --> 20:10.860
- Why would they? She's shy and quiet.
- Hmm.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.220
An outsider.

20:12.860 --> 20:13.940
The perfect accomplice.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.140
[both chuckle]

20:20.060 --> 20:21.700
[doorbell rings]

20:25.580 --> 20:26.780
Emma?

20:28.140 --> 20:29.460
Is Jason here? [sniffles]

20:30.580 --> 20:32.260
I need to talk with Jason.
