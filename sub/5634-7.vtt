00:01.502 --> 00:08.217
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:12.054
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.057
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:18.352
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.647
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.023
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.775
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:37.287 --> 00:39.206
Ah, Smitty's Steakhouse.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.375
You know, this was the
fanciest restaurant in Quahog

00:41.458 --> 00:42.668
when I was a kid.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.088
The ladies' room has a big space
with chairs in it, like a living room,

00:46.171 --> 00:48.257
before you get back
to where the crappers are.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.050
Good evening and welcome to Smitty's.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.052
I'll be back with martinis
for Mom and Dad,

00:52.135 --> 00:54.680
and for you kids, some martinis.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.265
Dad, can you pass the bread?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.809
Sure. But don't forget
the butter that looks like

00:58.892 --> 01:02.187
decorative bathroom soaps
and is impossible to smear.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.819
Thanks, Dad! This really ruins it!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.487
What will you be having, sir?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.240
pheasant on the glass.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.117
Don't you mean "pheasant under glass"?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.201
Nope.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.374
Yeah. Now turn around
and lay an egg on the glass.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.837
Aw, yeah.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.549
I defy you to tell me
exactly what's wrong with this.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.680
Oh, Peter, look.
You can put your business card

01:36.763 --> 01:38.682
in this bowl and maybe win a free lunch.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.475
I don't have a business card.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.561
And I think you knew that.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.271
I hope you enjoyed your meal, sir.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.480
May I offer you a toothpick?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.191
Oh, I-I don't know.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.318
We've already spent
a lot of money in here tonight.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.029
No, sir, it-it's free.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.158
Oh!

01:59.369 --> 02:01.288
Peter, that's not how you use a toothpick.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.664
You pick your teeth with it.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.125
I cannot believe
I have to explain this to you.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.212
There are gaps in my knowledge.
This is hardly news.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.216
Wow, this is awesome!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.551
This is like
I'm having a whole second meal!

02:17.054 --> 02:19.014
Man, this just feels right.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.142
That's it. From here on out, I
am about all things toothpick.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.770
I'm gonna go everywhere with
it, always be chewing on it,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.480
and start all my sentences with,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.273
"All right, here's what you're gonna do."

02:28.357 --> 02:30.192
Excuse me, we're from out of town.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.736
Where do people go to listen
to live music around here?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.738
I'll handle this. All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.532
Skip the live music. Get yourself a room

02:36.615 --> 02:38.742
over at the Wickford Marina.
Take her out on a balcony,

02:38.825 --> 02:40.994
point to any boat in the harbor,
and tell her it's yours.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.163
Now, you got rubbers?
Now that I'm a toothpick guy,

02:43.247 --> 02:45.165
I call 'em rubbers.
Or you could just pull the hose

02:45.249 --> 02:47.292
out of the bucket and let it spray free.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.670
I've had a vasectomy.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.217
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick
guy, it's my job to sit

02:55.300 --> 02:57.219
on a BMX bike outside the rec center

02:57.302 --> 02:59.555
and ask every kid if they're the new kid.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.557
Hey. You the new kid?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.392
- Why?
- Never mind why.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.768
Got any cool toys?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.228
Uh, I got an Xbox.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.814
- How about you?
- I got a Barbie with a wiener on it.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.817
Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe,
put it on with superglue.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.194
Looks pretty real. Real enough, anyways.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.154
- Does the job.
- Does what job?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.781
You get it.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.367
My family moves around a lot
'cause I do stuff like this.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.994
Um, okay.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.829
- I got to go now.
- You sure you don't want

03:23.912 --> 03:25.789
to come over and pull on my cat's nipples?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.876
We can do anything,
'cause my mom has two jobs.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.629
All right, I'm off to the fish market.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.381
What? Why?

03:34.464 --> 03:36.216
Well, the most intimidating
people are toothpick guys

03:36.300 --> 03:38.427
who work at seafood counters
and make people uncomfortable

03:38.510 --> 03:40.179
for not knowing about fish.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.889
- What's good here?
- It's all good.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.348
- What's the freshest?
- It's all fresh.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.434
- How 'bout the halibut? Is it gamey?
- Gamey?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.811
- I mean, you know, is it fishy?
- It's all fish.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.439
- Is there a special way to prepare it?
- I'd cook it up.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.232
W-Well, what's the best fish here?

03:52.316 --> 03:53.775
What's your favorite fish?

03:53.859 --> 03:56.028
I don't eat fish. I only like spaghetti.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.035
Ugh, when are you gonna
get rid of that toothpick?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.412
It's disgusting,
and it's starting to smell.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.497
Why would I give it up?
It's getting me tons of tail.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.791
- What?
- And check this out.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.127
The rare triple toothpick flip.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.468
Oh, my God, are you all right?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.261
No, I swallowed it!

04:21.345 --> 04:23.222
My toothpick! It's gone!

04:23.305 --> 04:25.307
Damn it! I'm gonna need
you to put that large,

04:25.390 --> 04:26.850
two-handed colander over the toilet.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.852
Peter, that was
a wedding present from my aunt.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.354
Well, let's use the ice cream maker!

04:30.437 --> 04:31.647
We've never used it once!

04:31.730 --> 04:34.316
Calm down. You can always
get another toothpick.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.068
Oh, my God, you're right!

04:36.151 --> 04:37.444
Lois, we got to drive
to Smitty's right now

04:37.528 --> 04:39.446
- and get one.
- Now?

04:39.530 --> 04:42.699
But we told Chris we'd be there
when he wakes up from surgery.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.411
All right, we were able
to fix your hernia,

04:46.495 --> 04:48.914
but you've got to stop
lifting sewer hole covers.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.499
But the Ninja Turtles live down there.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.917
I'm friends with them.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.044
Hey, fat ass, I brought you flowers.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.713
But stay out of the sewers!
We're trying to work down there.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.049
Thanks, Donatello!

05:00.801 --> 05:02.261
Oh, thank God!

05:02.344 --> 05:03.887
Quick, we need another toothpick!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.391
Thank you, Maurice.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.194
Just get your toothpick
and let's get out of here.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.445
Ugh. No, thanks.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.906
That old lady has ruined
toothpicks for me.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.158
Just like how Meg ruined broccoli.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.160
Hey, Meg, look, they're little trees!

05:27.244 --> 05:28.537
No, they're not.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.539
They're not?

05:30.622 --> 05:33.125
Hey, Peter!

05:33.208 --> 05:35.711
Oh, look, there's Quagmire
and his transgendered mother,

05:35.794 --> 05:38.755
which is now great.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.382
Hey, Quagmire. Hey, Ida.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.967
I didn't know you liked Smitty's.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.552
Oh, yeah, I've been coming here for ages.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.512
They even named a sandwich after me.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.764
It's an inside-out hot dog
slathered in ketchup.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.766
Please, please join us.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.769
Oh, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your brave dinner.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.521
Nonsense, we're happy to have you.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.231
All right, but we already ate dinner,

05:56.315 --> 05:59.735
so maybe just an iceberg wedge,
a steak and some sides.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.196
And then I said something random
that suggested

06:02.279 --> 06:03.780
a whole crazy story!

06:06.283 --> 06:08.202
Oh, God, that's hilarious, Lois.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.995
I could listen to you talk all night.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.497
Yeah, but we got to get going.
Carter's our babysitter,

06:12.581 --> 06:15.709
and if he's with the kids too
long, they start saying racisms.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.711
Aw, I wish the fun didn't have to end.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.422
I always enjoy spending time with you two.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.174
Well, why don't you come over tomorrow?

06:22.257 --> 06:25.594
We'll fire up the grill and have
the gang over for a cookout.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.846
- Well, that sounds wonderful.
- Well, great, we'll be there!

06:27.930 --> 06:29.765
Hey, before you two
leave, let's take a photo.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.184
Yeah! Selfie!

06:32.267 --> 06:34.478
I just learned that word.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.025
Perfect! Well, good night, you guys.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.444
See you tomorrow, hashtags!

06:42.528 --> 06:44.696
You're not doing that right.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.536
Boy, that Lois is really
something, isn't she?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.413
Yeah. Peter's a lucky guy.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.624
Glenn, do you...

06:55.707 --> 06:57.626
do you have feelings for her?

06:57.709 --> 06:59.837
What? No.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.380
A mother always knows.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.382
You like to play the
field, but, deep down,

07:03.465 --> 07:06.051
you really wish you had a
woman like Lois, don't you?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.303
No, I don't want a woman <i>like</i> Lois.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.972
I want Lois.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.099
She's perfect. I've loved her for years.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.476
She's warm and kind and beautiful.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.062
I've never been so in love with anyone.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.856
Glenn, that's very sweet,

07:18.939 --> 07:21.483
but you're talking about
your best friend's wife.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.985
I know, I know. It's wrong.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.486
And Peter's a good friend.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.405
Not like Cleveland.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.490
Hey, I got two of these phone books.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.992
Didn't know if you wanted one.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.202
Hey, how long have we known each other?

07:32.286 --> 07:36.206
Long time. And yet we've never
discussed mothers' maiden names,

07:36.290 --> 07:39.501
the names of old pets,
high school mascots,

07:39.585 --> 07:40.711
favorite teachers.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.296
Heck, I don't even know

07:42.379 --> 07:43.797
the last four digits of your Social.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.591
Cleveland, do you need
to borrow some money?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.885
I do! They're gonna kill Donna!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.888
- Really? No. I just want
- to buy a man's fur coat.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.681
Get out of here.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.269
- Hey, Peter,

07:57.352 --> 07:59.062
I had an extra phone book, and I...

07:59.146 --> 08:01.523
- I'm not buying you that coat!

08:08.530 --> 08:10.032
Huh? Who? What?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.034
Yeah, what? What? Which
doggy in what window?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.619
So, how'd everything go?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.662
Hard to tell. I was
coughing the whole time.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.664
By the way, I couldn't figure
out how to use your oven,

08:17.748 --> 08:19.333
so I destroyed it in a blind rage.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.084
Well, good night.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.088
Ooh, after that steak, I got
to go lay down on the toilet.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.675
Huh. Looks like I got
a couple of messages.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.886
- <i>Uh, Dad? Dad?</i>

08:30.969 --> 08:33.555
<i>Grandpa's going nuts on the oven.</i>
<i>Can you come home quick?</i>

08:33.639 --> 08:35.182
Who the hell is that?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.518
Huh. There's one from Quagmire.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.729
Huh, must've pocket-dialed me again.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.106
<i>I want Lois.</i>
<i>She's perfect.</i>

08:43.190 --> 08:44.566
<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

08:44.650 --> 08:47.319
<i>She's warm and kind and beautiful.</i>

08:47.402 --> 08:49.321
<i>I've never been so in love with anyone.</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:51.740
Oh, my God!

08:51.823 --> 08:53.617
Quagmire's in love with my wife?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.410
- Hello?

08:55.494 --> 08:57.412
<i>Peter, I'm having troubles on the toilet.</i>

08:57.496 --> 08:58.747
<i>Bring the ice cream maker.</i>

09:05.796 --> 09:08.090
Brian, there's something I
got to talk to you about.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.217
Quagmire pocket-dialed me last night.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.344
You got to hear this.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.555
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

09:14.638 --> 09:15.889
<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:17.391
Oh, my God!

09:17.474 --> 09:18.934
He's in love with Lois?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.769
Yeah, and if you keep
listening, you can hear

09:20.853 --> 09:23.188
a Puerto Rican busboy get
fired in the background.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.606
It's pretty funny. He cries.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.732
But can you believe Quagmire?

09:25.816 --> 09:27.568
Well, I guess it's not that shocking.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.237
I mean, he has said 100 times
that he wants to bang Lois.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.447
No, no, no, that's just
Quagmire being a horn-dog.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.199
This is love. I don't know.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.368
I think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.745
Too big a deal? The guy's
been sitting next to me

09:38.829 --> 09:40.372
all these years,
acting like he's my friend,

09:40.455 --> 09:42.666
when all he really wants
is to be with my wife!

09:42.749 --> 09:44.334
Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you,

09:44.418 --> 09:46.420
he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.380
You know what? I'm going
over there right now

09:48.463 --> 09:51.133
and hit him with a shovel, like
a white trash YouTube girl.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.759
Peter, wait, wait. Listen.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.678
Delete that message
and pretend you never heard it.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.013
What? Why?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.848
Because you weren't meant to hear it.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.684
If you act on this, all you'll
do is wreck your friendship

10:00.767 --> 10:02.477
and cause heartache for everyone involved.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.229
What, so what am I supposed
to do, just ignore it?

10:04.354 --> 10:05.647
Yeah. Ignore it.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.774
Like you do with the ghost
of that colonial woman

10:07.858 --> 10:09.401
who died falling down our stairs.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.572
I saw you eat a crayon.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.782
It was purple. I thought it was grape.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.951
Look, you've got to be the bigger man.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.953
You got to just keep this to yourself.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.039
Fine, I won't say anything.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.208
Good. And don't be
passive-aggressive, either.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.002
Like one of those songs in an old musical.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.714
<i>You're hideous</i>

10:30.797 --> 10:32.174
<i>To be without</i>

10:32.257 --> 10:33.759
<i>You're big and fat</i>

10:33.842 --> 10:35.719
<i>In the heart, no doubt</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:37.429
<i>You're a horrible loss</i>

10:37.513 --> 10:39.515
<i>If you won't be my wife</i>

10:39.598 --> 10:41.808
<i>You're a raging, continuous</i>

10:41.892 --> 10:44.770
<i>Love in my life...</i>

10:51.527 --> 10:52.778
Pretty good turnout for this thing.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.280
Oh, yeah, Mort <i>and</i> Neil Goldman.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.282
It's like Coachella.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.454
There's that son of a bitch.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.456
He's got some nerve showing up here.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.291
Peter, remember what we talked about.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.918
Look at them clouds up there.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.670
Yeah, that one look like Nathan.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.213
That one look like Shawn.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.881
And there go Wanya over there.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.884
How blessed are we to have
all them Boyz II Men

11:15.968 --> 11:18.011
just floating around in the sky?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.847
Glenn! Ida! You made it!

11:19.930 --> 11:22.683
Hey, Lois. I brought the
hamburger buns, like you wanted.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.101
I wasn't sure what people like,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.562
so I got some with seeds on them
and some without.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.730
What does he mean by that, "seeds"?

11:28.814 --> 11:30.524
Like semen? Is that what he means?

11:30.607 --> 11:33.277
Semen on her buns.
Am I the only one hearing this?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.863
Get the hell away from my wife,
you scumbag!

11:35.946 --> 11:37.322
Peter, what are you talking about?

11:37.406 --> 11:38.907
I'll tell you what I'm talking about!

11:38.991 --> 11:40.075
I'm talking about this!

11:40.158 --> 11:41.910
<i>Idea for a movie.</i>

11:41.994 --> 11:45.581
Fop Cop.<i> It's a cop</i>
<i>who's, like, a fancy guy.</i>

11:45.664 --> 11:47.666
Nobody heard that! None of you take that!

11:47.749 --> 11:49.751
What I meant to play was this.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.920
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

11:52.004 --> 11:53.797
<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

11:53.922 --> 11:56.466
<i>Fop Cop. </i>That could work.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.552
Glenn... i-is this true?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.054
Wait a minute, how the hell'd
you get that recording, Peter?

12:01.138 --> 12:03.098
You pocket-dialed me, you bastard!

12:03.182 --> 12:04.850
Peter, that was a private conversation.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.145
That doesn't change the fact
that you want to steal my wife!

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
Hey, get your hands off me!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.900
Oh, my God!

12:12.983 --> 12:14.484
- Oh, come on, you two.
- Come on, now.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.777
Hey, what are y'all doing? Stop! Stop it!

12:15.861 --> 12:18.363
Kill him, Dad! Murder him!

12:20.991 --> 12:22.951
That's it! End of cookout!

12:23.035 --> 12:26.580
Get out of my house, and don't
ever speak to me again!

12:27.956 --> 12:29.875
Wow, that turned ugly fast.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.294
Just like my trip to Tampa Bay.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.506
Hey, city boy, what's with the arm pants?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.763
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

12:42.846 --> 12:44.640
<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

12:44.723 --> 12:46.767
You're still
listening to that thing?

12:46.850 --> 12:50.604
It's like, I can't even process
why he'd feel this way.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.773
Maybe... you know, maybe
play it one more time and...

12:52.856 --> 12:54.816
I can't believe this.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.610
I thought Quagmire was my friend!

12:56.693 --> 12:58.612
Peter, it's not that surprising.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.989
He's always had a potent sex drive.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.325
Remember his grandmother's funeral?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.453
Yeah, get it in there.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.205
Oh, I <i>wish</i> this was about sex.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.958
If he was just home
busting one to his buddy's wife,

13:11.041 --> 13:12.626
hell, we've all done that.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.169
I've heard. Allegedly.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.171
But not often. And never to Donna.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.173
Except when she wore
those shiny gold shorts

13:18.257 --> 13:19.383
to parent-teacher night.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.468
Oh, yeah, that was hilarious.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.846
Yeah, that was...
that was so tacky.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.932
But if Quagmire actually
has feelings for you,

13:27.015 --> 13:29.560
I'm afraid he might take you away from me.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.145
Peter, nobody's taking me anywhere.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.856
I love <i>you.</i>

13:33.939 --> 13:36.900
- Mmm.
- I love you, too, Lois.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.986
Hey, you ever heard any of the other wives

13:39.069 --> 13:40.195
saying they're attracted to me?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.032
No, um, not that I recall, no.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.826
Look, now that this is settled,

13:45.909 --> 13:48.620
maybe you and Glenn can
put this behind you.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.789
No way! How am I supposed
to be friends with someone

13:50.873 --> 13:52.040
who's in love with my wife?

13:52.124 --> 13:53.667
Quagmire is dead to me

13:53.750 --> 13:56.086
and needs to be dealt with
in an appropriate manner.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.213
Shame.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.965
Shame.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.508
Shame.

14:02.801 --> 14:03.969
Shame.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.847

<i>Shame, shame, shame</i>

14:06.930 --> 14:09.892
<i>Shame on you-hoo</i>

14:09.975 --> 14:13.103
<i>Shame, shame, shame</i>

14:13.187 --> 14:14.855
<i>Shame on Q...</i>

14:14.938 --> 14:18.150
This was serious, but it
turned into something fun.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.200
Glenn? Is that you?

14:26.283 --> 14:27.659
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.704
I was just buying a...
a... grocery store cane.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.122
See you, Lois.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.082
Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter

14:34.166 --> 14:37.294
aren't gonna talk this out,
you and I should.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.004
What's there to talk about?

14:39.087 --> 14:41.256
Everyone knows I'm in love
with my best friend's wife.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.008
It's pathetic. And humiliating.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.218
Glenn...

14:44.301 --> 14:46.094
I can't trust myself around you.

14:46.178 --> 14:49.431
It's probably best if I...
just never see you again.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.725
Well, you can't just avoid me forever.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.727
We live on the same street.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.354
Mm.

14:55.437 --> 14:59.066
Well, then... I know what I have to do.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.109
Goodbye, Lois.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.160
Oh, sour cream.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.745
You wanted me to remind you.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.080
Sour cream.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.962
Mr. Quagmire, which box
do these beads go in?

15:20.045 --> 15:21.964
Let me smell 'em.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.590
They go in the big box.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.592
Quagmire, I can't believe you're moving.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.303
Look, give it time...
this whole thing will blow over.

15:28.387 --> 15:29.930
No, it's too awkward.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.015
It's best for everyone if I just leave.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.183
That's too bad.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.436
We never got to do
that "Joe-Quagmire" lunch.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.567
Well, that'll do it.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.111
Peter, Quagmire's serious about this.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.196
You got to do something!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.698
You're right.

15:47.781 --> 15:48.949
Quagmire, wait!

15:49.032 --> 15:52.035
You almost left without this!

15:57.165 --> 16:00.002
You want me to be the one
that says "jiggety" now?

16:07.176 --> 16:09.178
<i>We now return to</i> Dateline.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.930

<i>The guy you think did it?</i>

16:12.014 --> 16:13.015
<i>He did it.</i>

16:13.098 --> 16:14.141
<i>Now go to bed.</i>

16:14.224 --> 16:16.143
<i>Your grandkids are coming tomorrow.</i>

16:20.147 --> 16:22.649
I had a pretty good egg dish last night.

16:22.733 --> 16:26.153
What? What-what am I supposed
to do with that information?

16:26.236 --> 16:28.572
Well, I don't know.
Maybe ask me for the recipe?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.532
- Do you have it?
- No.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.576
So what's going on with you guys?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.161
Nothing much.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.747
See, this is where Quagmire
normally would have told

16:36.830 --> 16:38.790
one of his outrageous sex stories.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.960
Aw, we don't need him.
I got a sex story for you.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.795
So I'm banging this chick,
and she's saying to me,

16:43.879 --> 16:45.797
"I'm worried that Chris won't
get into college."

16:45.881 --> 16:47.341
And then I says to her,

16:47.424 --> 16:49.218
"Yeah, that seems like
a legitimate concern."

16:49.301 --> 16:52.054
And then I lost my wood,
and so we just watched <i>Colbert,</i>

16:52.137 --> 16:54.890
and then I took a dump completely nude.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.725
Who else but Peter?

16:58.352 --> 17:01.104
Peter, face it,
without Quagmire, we're boring.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.773
Oh, come on, that ain't true.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.275
Yes, it is. He had all the fun ideas.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.111
Remember? He even took me parasailing.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.407
This is awesome! It's like I'm flying!

17:14.201 --> 17:16.787
I've never felt so alive!

17:16.870 --> 17:20.123
Oh, if only I had a pair of legs.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.710
All right!

17:26.338 --> 17:29.132
It was the fish part of me
that wanted 'em!

17:35.514 --> 17:38.141
Look, Peter, I'm sorry
Quagmire moved away,

17:38.225 --> 17:41.103
but you can't just sit around
the house and drink all day.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.272
It's all your fault
Quagmire fell in love with you.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.440
Traipsin' around in your tan pants

17:45.524 --> 17:48.151
and your green shirt
and your soothing voice.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.653
My fault?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.321
Yeah, everything is messed up.

17:51.405 --> 17:54.116
I lost my best friend,
my buddies are all fighting,

17:54.199 --> 17:56.535
that chick at work is saying
stuff that ain't true.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.120
Okay, you know what?

17:58.203 --> 17:59.496
Enough feeling sorry for yourself.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.665
We're fixing this now. Get in the car.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.458
- What? Why?
- You'll see.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.460
Why should I trust you?

18:05.544 --> 18:08.172
You're always tricking me into
going places I don't want to.

18:08.255 --> 18:12.050
Oh. You said we were going
to a place Walt Disney built.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.428
No, Peter. I said "supported."

18:19.808 --> 18:22.352
By the way,
don't go on the train ride.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.901
I've been playing a game I invented

18:28.984 --> 18:31.528
called "mini racquetball" in your garage.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.739
Uh-huh. It's pretty fun.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.532
He has not won a single point.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.951
You don't have to win to have fun.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.331
Lois?

18:42.414 --> 18:44.124
Peter. Zod.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.793
Hey. You're parked behind
my trapezoid-thing.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.004
Yeah, yeah, I'll move it in a sec.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.757
Glenn, all this nonsense has to stop now.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.134
The only reason
this became an issue is because

18:54.218 --> 18:56.178
Peter heard something
he wasn't supposed to hear.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.971
Guy from <i>Superman</i> lives here?

18:58.055 --> 19:00.224
And the truth is,
we all have private thoughts

19:00.307 --> 19:03.227
we don't act on, and that's okay.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.145
For instance, every time
I'm on the subway,

19:05.229 --> 19:07.356
I want to push a stranger onto the tracks.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.774
And that's fine!

19:08.857 --> 19:10.150
I don't do it!

19:10.234 --> 19:11.902
I guess you're right.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.363
I don't <i>totally</i> disagree with
what Kim Jong-un's doing,

19:14.446 --> 19:16.156
but you don't see me moving there.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.116
I take medicine
I get from the veterinarian.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.368
Is that one?

19:19.451 --> 19:21.286
No, no, it's not, but the point is,

19:21.370 --> 19:23.205
we all have secret thoughts.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.958
But there's no reason they
should ruin our friendships.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.918
Sometimes I think about
going to the hospital

19:28.001 --> 19:29.378
and switching the babies around.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.380
Somali pirates seem cool, too.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.549
I wouldn't mind eating
the Phillie Phanatic.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.885
See? We're all terrible people inside.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.762
Joe's a little worse than the rest of us,

19:38.887 --> 19:41.640
but we all just shove
our thoughts deep down

19:41.723 --> 19:43.392
where they can't hurt anybody.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.686
Huh, maybe you're right.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.521
Of course I'm right.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.607
The secret to happiness is
burying all your true feelings

19:50.691 --> 19:53.402
and living a life of bland compromise.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.612
So here's the question, Glenn.

19:55.696 --> 19:59.449
Do you love Peter enough
to repress your love for me?

20:03.537 --> 20:06.790
Peter, if you're willing
to forget all about this,

20:06.874 --> 20:10.335
I'm more than happy to continue
hiding my true feelings.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.462
I do miss us hanging out together.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.299
Huh. Sorry I kind of went a little crazy.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.217
Ah, that's all right.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.803
And I'm sorry
I will always love your wife.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.388
Which I don't.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.681
Thank you, Glenn.

20:22.764 --> 20:23.807
All right!

20:23.891 --> 20:27.477
What do you say we all celebrate
with a game of mini racquetball?

20:27.561 --> 20:31.023
Wait. Is mini racquetball just Ping-Pong?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.524
Kind of.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.031
Boy, it's good to have
the gang together again.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.824
Yeah, welcome home, buddy.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.410
Man, I missed sitting around,
just shooting the breeze.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.412
Hey, so how'd you get your house back?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.788
This ought to be good.

20:46.872 --> 20:48.332
I suspended escrow.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.499
Oh.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.254
Hey, guys, you know that egg
dish I was talking about?

20:54.338 --> 20:56.924
Turns out that was just a dream I had.
