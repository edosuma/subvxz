WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:03.828
[Bashir]: I'm sorry
but who are you?
- Rick Novak.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.830
I'm the acting chief
of this emergency department.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.703
You've been on
for two days straight.

00:07.746 --> 00:10.227
- How's the new guy
already telling me
I put too much on my plate?

00:10.271 --> 00:12.012
- How long have you known
we were here?

00:12.055 --> 00:13.274
- Since you came.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.539
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

00:17.582 --> 00:20.629
[Bashir]: I need a surgeon's
eyes on something, June.

00:21.630 --> 00:24.285
Car crash. Impact wound,
lower right quadrant.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.026
- How far are you from
a hospital?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.592
- Half an hour at least.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.030
I tried to find a consult,
but we're stretched thin.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.075
- Inter-abdominal pressure?
- Increasing.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.077
And his pressure is rapidly
decreasing.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.036
- One more dose of morphine,
Saleh.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.823
- I see bowel protrusion.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.216
- Abdominal evisceration.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.044
- A tear in the peritoneum
can release pressure.

00:44.087 --> 00:47.134
It has nowhere to go,
so it pushes the organs
to the surface.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.526
- Yeah, don't push them back in.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.050
Just douse a towel in saline,
cover them,

00:50.093 --> 00:51.703
and handle them
as little as possible.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.101
- There's an arterial bleed!

00:58.145 --> 01:00.147
[Bashir]: Find it, tie it off
then seal it.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.410
You need to keep the pressure up
or he won't make it.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.111
- We're out of sealant.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.504
- Um...

01:10.722 --> 01:13.203
Do you have electrodes?
- What's that?

01:20.123 --> 01:21.907
- Yes, we have some.
Hold it.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.867
[June]: Okay, take the adhesive,
seal off the wound.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.260
- Yeah!

01:26.956 --> 01:28.740
[heavy breathing]

01:33.354 --> 01:34.572
Okay.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.921
[in Arabic]:

01:35.965 --> 01:37.358
- He did it.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.578
- Trick I learned on a ride
along from hell.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.235
[brakes screeching]

01:54.157 --> 01:55.506
- Thank you, Doctor...?

01:55.550 --> 01:57.421
- Oh! June.
- I'm Saleh.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.771
- Where'd you learn to tie off
an artery that fast?

01:59.815 --> 02:01.556
- Ask the man beside you.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.210
- Thank you for this, June.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.950
- Oh, yeah.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.691
Anytime.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.596
So much has happened
for the both of us.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
[chuckling]

03:02.965 --> 03:04.880
[gentle music]

03:19.895 --> 03:21.766
[grunting]

03:23.028 --> 03:24.552
[dry chuckle]

03:24.595 --> 03:26.945
- The last time I thrilled
a woman by standing on my own,

03:26.989 --> 03:28.382
I was a child.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.166
- And my comparisons
to your mother end there?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.646
- Fiona was a handsome woman.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.300
[chuckling]
- That will do, pal.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.649
- You're fussing around me.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.868
Don't you have an exam
to study for?

03:36.912 --> 03:38.392
- I'm ready for it.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.396
Your rehab team wants to see you
today at 4 PM.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.876
- They say I'm making
fast progress.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.009
Could be on my feet soon.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.883
- You just had a stroke,
four days ago.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.363
Okay?

03:53.407 --> 03:55.060
Now you gotta pace yourself.

03:55.104 --> 03:58.150
And come up with
a long-term strategy
to build your strength.

03:58.586 --> 04:02.242
- I do happen to have a little
expertise on this subject,

04:02.285 --> 04:05.375
both professionally
and personally.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.725
- Hm, okay. I will give you
professionally.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.205
But personally?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.773
Your previous strategy
of racing back to work

04:11.816 --> 04:15.037
while I aided
with your self-medication
did not exactly help.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.908
- It helped get us back
together.

04:16.952 --> 04:17.995
- Hm.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.911
What are you worried about?

04:19.954 --> 04:22.566
This place is gonna fall apart
without you?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.569
Or that maybe, it won't?

04:25.613 --> 04:26.918
[groaning]

04:28.964 --> 04:32.054
- Ooh!
- Wait, vulture!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.158
- I made this for you!

04:49.201 --> 04:50.594
- Hmm.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.771
Ah, bravo, Amira.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.345
- Did you figure out
the streetcar?

05:02.389 --> 05:04.086
- I'm getting there.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.610
- I will show it to you.
Eat!

05:07.872 --> 05:09.526
What will you do today?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.620
- How long can you stay
at the hotel?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.448
- They said until I find
something.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.450
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, there he is.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.713
- Sorry to interrupt.
Don't get up.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.454
- Theo, this is Rania.
- Hey.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.282
- Thank you for having me
in your home.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.153
I promise to leave.
Unlike those two.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.111
[laughing]

05:29.154 --> 05:31.156
- He barely notices us
anymore.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.332
He's almost never around.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.334
- Theo was just made
an attending.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.466
- Congratulations!

05:36.510 --> 05:38.512
I also hear you have
two daughters?

05:38.555 --> 05:40.644
- Yes! Who I'll only have time
to put to bed

05:40.688 --> 05:43.473
if I can catch the 9 PM flight
back to Sudbury.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.302
- That can't be easy,
living apart from your family.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.696
- Champagne problems.
We're making it work.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.872
I have to go!

05:50.915 --> 05:52.308
It was nice meeting you.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.527
Bye!

05:54.049 --> 05:56.486
- Oh, that reminds me,
I'm on until 8 today,

05:56.530 --> 05:57.879
so straight home
after school, okay?

05:57.922 --> 06:01.273
- I have hip hop.
The after-school dance program.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.884
I told you yesterday.
It goes to 7.

06:02.927 --> 06:06.017
- Amira, I don't want you
taking the bus alone at night.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.889
- Maybe Rania could come?

06:08.759 --> 06:10.848
- Let's not put her to work
just yet.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.373
Ask Sadie if Herman
can drive you and let me know.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.505
- These remind me of that picnic
in the park.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.203
The pigeons wouldn't
leave us alone,

06:18.247 --> 06:20.815
so Bashir threw olives
at them.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.904
- Wallah,Amira,
if you saw these pigeons!

06:22.947 --> 06:25.428
- Was that the last time
you two saw each other?

06:26.429 --> 06:28.605
- No, um...

06:29.911 --> 06:31.347
No.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.915
But it was the last time
I let a pigeon push me around.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.746
Let's eat.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.270
- Mags?

06:41.313 --> 06:44.099
- Ephraim!
- It's so good to see you.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.842
- Hey, Deena. You're in another
cycle of chemo?

06:47.885 --> 06:51.585
- Three of seven. I didn't wanna
bug you this time, Mags.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.456
- But the pain
was too much today.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.371
And we couldn't get into
the oncologist last minute.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.894
- Hm. Are you taking something
for the pain?

06:56.938 --> 07:00.245
- Yeah, McKinney gave us
a pharmacy of analgesics.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.638
- That I barely get
to enjoy,

07:01.682 --> 07:03.640
since I spend all my time
hugging the toilet.

07:03.684 --> 07:06.121
- Any other side effects?
- Huh, joint stiffness.

07:06.164 --> 07:09.080
And I have been sending
some strongly worded emails

07:09.124 --> 07:11.518
to the people in my life
who have disappointed me,

07:11.561 --> 07:13.955
because at this point,
I figured who gives a crap?

07:13.998 --> 07:17.262
- Well, that one's widely
reported in the literature.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.788
Alright, well, let's get you
to baseline and we'll take it
from there.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.529
I'll start fluids
and something for the pain.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.313
- Yeah but they told us
you're not our doctor.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.054
I wanted to request you but--

07:26.097 --> 07:29.927
- But I told them
you're busy saving people
with an actual future.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.755
- I'm your doctor.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.322
- We never got the chance
to thank you properly.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.933
No, last time you stayed on
after your shift to help us.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.240
- Thank you!
- No thanks necessary.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.720
Meanwhile if you need
anything?

07:39.763 --> 07:41.896
- Press the call button.
- Yeah.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.159
- No, no, you're not listening
to me, okay?

07:44.202 --> 07:46.117
You tell your clients,
if they didn't want this
getting bloody

07:46.161 --> 07:48.468
they shouldn't have brought
a knife to a gun fight alright?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.947
See you in court!

07:49.991 --> 07:51.122
- Everything okay?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.211
- Aah! Corporate law,
figure of speech.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.650
- You told our triage nurse
that you could hear your heart?

07:56.693 --> 07:58.260
Does that mean beating fast
in your chest?

07:58.303 --> 08:01.350
Because it sounds normal.
- No, I can actually hear it.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
Like a stethoscope in my ear.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.615
- When did this start?
- Today.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.661
I know, I've got a lot
on my plate, alright?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.271
But I don't get panic attacks.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.795
- Okay, well, I've seen
the symptom you're describing

08:11.839 --> 08:13.884
accompany an inner ear
infection or--

08:13.928 --> 08:16.452
- Alright, an infection.
It's minor then.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.672
- That's one possibility.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.283
[sighing]

08:21.892 --> 08:23.807
Okay, I don't see any redness.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.548
Have you experienced
any dizziness at all?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.028
- Yeah, actually.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.987
So, what's that,
just an antibiotic
to clear it up?

08:30.031 --> 08:32.642
- No! We need to rule out
anything serious
with a range of tests.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.078
- Fine. How long
is this gonna be?

08:34.121 --> 08:35.950
I need to get back
to the office like an hour ago.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.212
- I'll be back
as soon as I can.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.786
- The lady in five is
on your list, but do you mind
if I take her?

08:45.829 --> 08:47.527
I have a broken ankle
if you wanted to swap?

08:47.570 --> 08:48.745
- And good morning to you too,
Mags.

08:48.789 --> 08:49.964
- It's not a buffet, Leblanc.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.922
You have to get sign-off
to trade patients.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.534
- But... this is a woman
I treat regularly
for chemo side effects.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.884
- And do the two of you
have some kind
of exclusivity contract

08:56.927 --> 08:59.234
that I don't know about?
What about you, Doctor Hamed,

08:59.277 --> 09:00.844
do you have any interesting
patients this morning?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.672
- I just saw a man in E
who's presenting--

09:02.716 --> 09:04.152
- Yeah, I read the chart.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.502
That usually describes tinnitus,
the cause of which is,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.678
generally
a fishing expedition,

09:08.722 --> 09:11.333
but I already called an ENT
and in the meanwhile,

09:11.376 --> 09:15.685
you can order an EKG and bloods
just to be on the safe side,
heart-wise.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.035
- Deena Kaplan has a terminal
diagnosis of lymphoma.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.602
She's in a fierce battle
to extend her life

09:19.646 --> 09:21.691
but the pain and the nausea
keep sending her here.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.563
I have a short-hand with her
and her husband.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.390
- Are these people your friends?
- Right. Right.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.610
You'd prefer I'd see my patients
as needy bags of meat,

09:27.654 --> 09:28.916
as you put it, right?
[laughing]

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
- You don't have to sound
so callous about it!

09:30.657 --> 09:31.875
- Since I know their history,

09:31.919 --> 09:33.660
it'll be more efficient for me
to help them.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.139
This is about continuity
of care.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.358
- Okay.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.752
- Okay... that's it?

09:39.666 --> 09:40.884
- Why not?

09:40.928 --> 09:42.582
I'm interested to see
what you can offer

09:42.625 --> 09:44.192
that your other residents
can't.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.715
- No, that's not what I--

09:45.759 --> 09:48.588
Okay, that's not what I was
saying at all.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.721
- Does your attending have you
doing paperwork again?

09:51.765 --> 09:52.983
- No, why would he need?

09:53.027 --> 09:55.246
- Oh, nothing.
Just conversation.

09:55.943 --> 09:59.294
- Actually, I was taking it
upon myself to propose

09:59.337 --> 10:02.514
some workflow efficiencies
to Singh for the surgical
calendar.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.647
- Oh! Good for you.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.824
Never apologize for playing
the game, Doctor Curtis.

10:11.872 --> 10:14.135
- Is that how Novak beat you
to the Acting Chief position?

10:14.178 --> 10:17.921
Because you've been Bishop's
second forever and...

10:17.965 --> 10:20.881
I just...
thought it should be you.

10:20.924 --> 10:24.580
Since you've been here
for so long.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.929
[sighing]

10:25.973 --> 10:29.019
Nice talk, June.
Nice...

10:29.803 --> 10:31.413
- Code blue in E!

10:32.457 --> 10:34.024
[suspenseful music]

10:34.851 --> 10:37.332
- He's in V-fib! Mags!
- Got it!

10:38.463 --> 10:41.336
- Prep one amp of epi!
Charge the defib two hundred J!

10:41.379 --> 10:43.599
- Is that the guy with tinnitus?
- His EKG was normal.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.514
We're waiting on bloods
but he was stable.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.733
- Charged!

10:46.776 --> 10:48.169
[machine beeping]
- Clear!

10:50.388 --> 10:52.042
Resume compressions.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.870
- EMS incoming!

10:53.914 --> 10:55.959
- You need to take it, Arnold!

10:57.047 --> 10:59.267
[dramatic music]

11:01.356 --> 11:02.792
- Carly Miller, 16 years old.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.708
BP is 105 over 80,
rate's 140.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.536
Severe blood loss,
we've tried multiple lines

11:07.579 --> 11:10.191
but her veins are flat,
so we've intubated
to secure the airway.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.323
- Carly was home for lunch
and then started coughing

11:12.367 --> 11:14.369
and then there was bleeding
and it wouldn't stop!

11:14.412 --> 11:15.718
- This is Hannah, her sister.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.807
- I'm Theo, Hannah.
Where are Mom and Dad?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.809
- Huh. They're on their way
to Chile for work.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.203
What's happening to her?
Is she gonna be okay?

11:22.246 --> 11:24.205
- We'll find out.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.513
- Epi in.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.037
[machine]: Charge at five!

11:30.733 --> 11:32.213
- Mags!

11:33.257 --> 11:36.478
- She's lost a significant
amount of blood
and the clock is ticking.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.828
- I'm seeing fresh scabs
where her tonsils used to be.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.351
- Recent tonsillectomy?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.439
- Her sister didn't say

11:41.483 --> 11:42.702
but I've seen this before.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.007
Post-op fibrin clot
sloughs off

11:44.051 --> 11:45.705
the tonsillar pillar
and ruptures.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.924
- We have to get her stable and
put pressure on the bleeding.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.752
- Activating MTP. Arnold,
we need blood and lots of it.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.058
- Take over,
I can't find the vein.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.755
- June, where are we
on that line?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.017
- It's a difficult stick.
It keeps collapsing.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.715
- She needs to have the blood.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.717
Without blood she won't make it.
What's your plan, Doctor Curtis?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.240
- Bone gun?
- Okay.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.025
- What about it?
- Doctor Curtis is proposing

12:02.069 --> 12:03.940
an interosseous transfusion.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.681
Peripheral access
isn't happening.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.335
- The humeral's IO it is.
Allow me.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.730
- It's okay, I've got it.
- Good. By all means.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.776
[whirring]

12:13.820 --> 12:15.517
- Give me a line, Arnold.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.171
- Airway entry both sides?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.563
- Placement.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.218
- Oxygen 98.
CO2 40.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.611
- Blood's coming in!

12:23.307 --> 12:25.919
- Stabilizing
but she'll need the OR.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.791
- I'll call up.
[beeping]

12:28.835 --> 12:30.880
- I think you can take it
from here, Wendy.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.143
[Bashir]: Clear!

12:34.492 --> 12:36.016
Mags.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.020
Go again, one more epi.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.806
- How long's this guy been down?
- 19 minutes.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.242
- Who's running this code?
- I am!

12:45.286 --> 12:47.854
- Leblanc is slowing down.
Doctor Hamed, take over.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.944
- Epi in.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.426
- Hold compressions.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.825
[panting]

13:02.869 --> 13:05.045
No, he's not responsive.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.742
It's time to call it.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.049
- He's only 37 years old.
Came in with
a minor hearing issue,

13:09.092 --> 13:10.093
otherwise he's healthy.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.878
- He's dead, Doctor Hamed.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.184
Asystole, prolonged downtime.
No correctable causes.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.752
No cardiac activity
after eight rounds of CPR.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.493
Did I miss anything?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.805
- No.
- In that case...

13:27.676 --> 13:29.504
Time of death?

13:32.681 --> 13:34.552
- 11:38 AM.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.818
Let's take a moment to
acknowledge the loss of a life,

13:38.861 --> 13:41.168
and the efforts of our team
to save it.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.259
[beeping]

13:46.347 --> 13:49.002
- Rate's climbing.
Is that possible?

13:51.004 --> 13:53.049
- That's something
you don't see every day.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.923
- He's alive.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.490
[gentle music]

13:59.534 --> 14:01.884
[steady beeping]

14:05.583 --> 14:07.629
- Swift work with that bone gun.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.980
Heard your bleeder needs
an embolization?

14:11.024 --> 14:13.548
- Yeah.
- I called Doctor Yong
in vascular.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.984
We went to med school together.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.465
I told him you should be
the one assisting him today.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.859
So get ready.
- Uh...

14:20.642 --> 14:23.297
Doctor Singh is my attending,
he's in general surgery.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.733
- I know Aajay.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.822
Is he still in love with
the sound of his own voice?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.129
- I just mean that I wouldn't
normally be scrubbing in

14:29.172 --> 14:30.957
as part of
the vascular team. So--

14:31.000 --> 14:33.524
- Don't all surgical residents
want a cross-section
of experience?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.180
No one ever done you
a favour before?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.008
- Definitely not someone
I barely know.

14:39.052 --> 14:42.185
- When a member of my team
does good work like you did,
in trauma,

14:42.229 --> 14:44.927
I like to see them
get rewarded for it.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.624
You're welcome.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.671
[scoffs]

14:49.714 --> 14:51.455
[Hannah]: Why isn't Carly awake?

14:51.499 --> 14:54.110
Why does she still have
the breathing tube?

14:54.154 --> 14:55.938
What's happening to her?

14:55.982 --> 14:58.288
- A tiny blood clot ruptured

14:58.332 --> 15:00.682
and tore a hole
in Carly's carotid artery.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.685
Normally a surgeon would just
make an incision and repair it,

15:03.728 --> 15:07.167
but the location of the tear...

15:07.210 --> 15:09.169
puts your sister
at a higher risk.

15:09.212 --> 15:12.476
So we're looking at something
called a transcatheter
embolization,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.783
where instead of opening up
her neck,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.654
we'll reach the wound
by going through her leg.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.701
[stammering]
-I don't understand.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.922
Are you saying that one of these
options could kill her?

15:23.444 --> 15:25.446
- I'm saying it won't heal
on its own.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.710
Carly's life is on the line
either way.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.017
We're recommending what
we believe is the safer option

15:31.060 --> 15:33.541
but since your parents
aren't here to weigh in...

15:33.584 --> 15:35.804
- You're asking me to decide?

15:35.847 --> 15:39.373
No. No way.
You can't put this on me.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.028
- Hannah, I'm not putting
anything on you.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.681
We'll do this together, okay?

15:43.725 --> 15:46.032
But it's important that
your sister has an advocate.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.817
Okay? Someone who knows her,
who can weigh in

15:48.860 --> 15:51.820
on the decision-making process.
For example,

15:52.386 --> 15:55.519
if we knew about
her tonsillectomy,
that would've helped us.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.869
- Oh, my God. We... I...

15:57.913 --> 16:01.047
I told the paramedics
about that, didn't I?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.439
Is that why this happened?

16:02.483 --> 16:04.398
I mean that surgery was like
a month ago.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.617
The doctors said that
my mom and dad could go--

16:06.661 --> 16:08.793
- Hannah, Hannah, it's okay,
we reached out to the surgeon--

16:08.837 --> 16:11.492
- No, no, no, it's not okay.
Look, you gotta understand.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.407
Carly is everything to them.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.756
I mean, to me!

16:14.799 --> 16:16.279
They would never want me
involved and--

16:16.323 --> 16:18.499
- I know that's not true.
They left you in charge when--

16:18.542 --> 16:20.457
- I just got fired
from my retail job.

16:21.023 --> 16:24.592
Three engineers and one girl
who can't fold a sweater.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.115
That's our family.

16:26.159 --> 16:29.989
Carly's younger than me
but she's the responsible one.

16:32.513 --> 16:35.820
I mean they were expecting her
to take care of me.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.345
- Look, Carly's in the OR queue,

16:38.388 --> 16:40.825
so there's a little more time.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.306
We'll keep trying to reach
your parents for now, okay?

16:43.350 --> 16:45.221
[machine beeping]

16:45.265 --> 16:47.832
- You're saying I was dead.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.139
Not unconscious.
Dead.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.142
[beeping]
- Auto-resuscitation is
a rare phenomenon

16:53.186 --> 16:56.102
where the body responds
to CPR after death.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.712
- For how long?

16:57.755 --> 16:59.931
- You had a weak
but shockable rhythm

16:59.975 --> 17:03.587
without pulse for 19 minutes,
and then, nothing.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.461
- Isn't that extremely bad?

17:07.503 --> 17:09.984
- It can be, but your vitals
are normal again.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.290
You're very lucky.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.423
- Okay. I'm lucky.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.295
What happens now?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.210
- We need to do
some more tests,

17:17.252 --> 17:18.950
to understand
why this happened.

17:18.993 --> 17:20.473
- No kidding.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.301
You said it was
an ear infection,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.347
then a few minutes later,
I die?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.785
- Is there someone
you want me to call,

17:27.829 --> 17:30.310
anybody you want to come down
here to stay with you?

17:30.353 --> 17:34.879
- What I want is for you
to not make the same mistake
you made before.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.404
Just figure out what's going on
and tell me what to do about it.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.755
- Navin, none of your tests
presented any indication
of cardiac abnormality.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.584
We're widening our search
but it will take some time
to figure out exactly--

17:43.627 --> 17:45.281
- You're a resident, right?

17:45.325 --> 17:48.850
- Yes.
- Yeah. Why don't you just admit
you're in over your head

17:48.893 --> 17:50.634
and send me
whoever you report to.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.724
Maybe I won't have to die
this time to get some help
around here.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.168
[breathing heavily]

18:03.038 --> 18:05.084
[gentle music]

18:05.693 --> 18:08.130
- Hey!
Pain meds helping?

18:08.174 --> 18:11.351
- The IV drip means at least
I'm not throwing them up.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.267
I think that nurse wants
to strangle me.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.964
- Trust me, she's seen worse.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.053
You're halfway through
a chemo cycle.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.142
Your nausea's normally
progressive.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.144
- We knew it was an aggressive
course.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.668
They said if I make it through,
it can buy six months.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.496
So that's where we're at.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.717
- Speaking of that nurse
who definitely does not want
to strangle you,

18:29.760 --> 18:31.719
I asked her how often
you've emptied your bladder

18:31.762 --> 18:34.548
and she says not once?
- I haven't needed to go.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.071
- Well, we've been loading you
with fluids.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
Can you sit up for me, please?
And just raise your arms.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.336
There's a few things
I want to rule out.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.077
Here we go.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.994
- Level with me, Mags.
What are we worried about?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.736
- The usual. Infection,

18:48.779 --> 18:52.392
kidney and liver function,
things we've looked into before.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.220
We'll run blood work,
just to be safe.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.438
You can lie back down.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.093
Is Ephraim nearby
to take you to the lab?

18:58.485 --> 19:00.791
- I made him take a walk.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.185
He won't like this.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.231
- I can explain it to him
when he gets back

19:05.274 --> 19:07.015
[chuckling]
- You can try!

19:07.058 --> 19:09.844
McKinney's been clear that
my body can only take so much.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.847
I hear that when she says it,
but Eph thinks

19:12.890 --> 19:16.633
we're gonna make it to our
10th anniversary to New Zealand.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.550
- Why don't I take you
to the lab.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.117
Can I get a wheelchair
in here?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.250
- Don't you have a thousand more
patients to see?

19:24.293 --> 19:26.643
- Yes.
But it's on the way.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.210
- Liar.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.126
But it saves that poor nurse
from having to come back.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.997
[chuckling]

19:33.520 --> 19:35.174
Can you walk?

19:36.087 --> 19:37.741
[gentle music]

19:41.658 --> 19:43.225
- Heard you were looking
for me?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.748
- Hum. Navin Kutty.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.098
We did two ECGs,
both inconclusive.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.797
His blood proteins look normal,
echo looks normal,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.842
so I think we should give him
a MRI just in case--

19:51.886 --> 19:53.496
- How does he feel
about being alive?

19:53.540 --> 19:55.106
- Sir?

19:55.150 --> 19:58.153
- I'm curious. How's the guy
feel, coming back from the dead?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.677
- He's more focused on the fact
that we let him die

20:00.721 --> 20:02.549
than the mystery
of being alive.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.638
- I wasn't wrong
to terminate CPR when I did.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.030
- I didn't say you were.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.119
- And his being alive isn't
a mystery.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.383
It's... lingering
electrical current and luck.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.908
- I'd like to order an MRI
in case of pulmonary AVM.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.171
Circulatory problems can result
a hearing issues--

20:16.215 --> 20:18.478
- Nah, I'd rather you get him
to the cath lab
for electrophysiology.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.567
And do that soon,
we need answers.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.569
- But sir, that's a very
invasive test.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.311
- I'd also be interested to know
where that patient is from.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.226
- Well, I would assume Canada.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.141
- His lineage, Doctor Hamed.
- Why is that relevant?

20:30.925 --> 20:33.057
- It's not, potentially,
but then again maybe it is.

20:33.101 --> 20:36.278
So find out, do the tests
and let me know.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.759
- Well, he doesn't want to speak
with me, Doctor Novak,

20:38.802 --> 20:40.587
he'd rather speak with you.
- No.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.458
I think you've got it handled.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.982
It's interesting to see
Doctor Bishop training

20:45.026 --> 20:46.506
his residents to push back.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.377
It wasn't my experience
with him.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.772
Or maybe he doesn't
and that's just you.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.339
A good leader isn't afraid
to be challenged.

20:53.382 --> 20:56.342
And since we don't know
how long he's gonna be out for,

20:56.385 --> 20:57.995
it's good we get along.

21:00.476 --> 21:03.131
- Carly Miller, 16 years old.
Arrived via ambulance

21:03.174 --> 21:06.700
with oral hemorrhage associated
with a tonsillectomy
clot rupture

21:06.743 --> 21:08.528
and secondary lacerated
arterial wall.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.704
I referred to vascular
for embolization.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.923
- But kept a little piece
for yourself.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.709
- We'll circle back post-op.
What's up next?

21:15.752 --> 21:18.407
- We've got a discectomy
in B.

21:18.451 --> 21:19.800
[scoffs]

21:19.843 --> 21:21.889
- You want me to send her
to the corner for that?

21:21.932 --> 21:23.847
- I earned a spot
on vascular for this.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.546
I'm not gonna feel bad
because some resident
thinks I skipped the line.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.330
- You're a fighter, June.
I get that.

21:28.374 --> 21:31.290
And while you do need in
on as many complex surgeries
as possible,

21:31.333 --> 21:33.727
if you want to make
Chief Resident...

21:33.770 --> 21:35.294
- What? I need to be liked?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.296
- Respected.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.080
There's a difference.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.735
- Does that not apply
to Harris?

21:41.778 --> 21:43.867
Because she wants the job
as much as I do.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.871
- Doctor Harris isn't the only
Black surgical resident

21:47.915 --> 21:49.656
we've had here in three years.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.572
- So I both need the operative
time but I shouldn't take it?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.095
What are you telling me
to do here?

21:54.138 --> 21:57.316
- I'm not. I'm just pointing out
the landmines.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.280
[knocking]

22:05.324 --> 22:07.108
- I was just...

22:07.151 --> 22:10.329
down the hall talking to a tech
about electrophysiology.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.941
- Is this for your
auto-resuscitation patient
from this morning?

22:13.984 --> 22:17.074
The nurses have been talking
about it.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.989
- Have you ever had one?

22:19.555 --> 22:22.863
- Yeah once, when I was doing
my residency.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.648
We did CPR on a newborn.

22:26.257 --> 22:29.913
Electrophysiology is not a test
you order every day,

22:29.957 --> 22:33.003
it's pretty invasive.
- It wasn't my call.

22:33.526 --> 22:37.007
Doctor Novak.
He was one of your residents?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.227
- He's a gifted doctor.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.622
- Did you know him long
before he joined
Doctors Without Borders?

22:42.665 --> 22:46.974
It's an interesting transition
to the kind of structure
you find here.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.063
- You'd know better
than I would.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.806
- He's your Chief, Doctor Hamed.
Not me.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.983
- It's just, in his mind,
sir...

22:56.026 --> 22:58.464
He thinks this is
a permanent position.

22:58.507 --> 22:59.987
- So he wants my job.

23:00.030 --> 23:03.294
He'd be an idiot not to.
It's a great job.

23:05.949 --> 23:09.692
- The, uh... newborn
who came back to life.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.825
- We called her Baby Lazarus.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.914
- And would you explain
that as

23:13.957 --> 23:17.091
lingering electrical
current and luck?

23:17.526 --> 23:18.701
- Yeah, I would.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.834
Although the current was
only lingering

23:20.877 --> 23:24.011
because we did more than
20 minutes of CPR.

23:24.054 --> 23:27.231
But then, what some call luck,
others call a miracle.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.104
- My patient's not exactly
moved by his.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.933
- Maybe because
they tend to scare you
as much as save you.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.892
It's easier to ignore that fear
than face it.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.113
But then, look at me.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.646
- Talk to me about shift change
transition, Leblanc?

23:50.690 --> 23:53.562
- Uh... I'm still on
another hour.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.219
I cleared the food poisoning
in six,

23:58.262 --> 23:59.699
broken ribs in three's
being discharged,

23:59.742 --> 24:01.831
and my cancer patient in five
still waiting on labs.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.224
- Which the next shift
will handle.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.008
- Mm-hmm.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.575
- Do we not pay porters

24:06.619 --> 24:08.969
to take the patients
up to the blood lab?

24:09.012 --> 24:10.361
- Yes.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.930
- So your escorting Miss Kaplan
up there earlier,

24:13.974 --> 24:17.020
that's the reason why
you wanted to trade patients?

24:17.064 --> 24:19.370
- I mean, can't a doctor go
the extra mile?

24:19.414 --> 24:21.024
You know like I said earlier,
I like to--

24:21.068 --> 24:23.723
- Yeah, you have a shorthand
but, what I don't understand

24:23.766 --> 24:25.681
is why that makes you
the only person capable

24:25.725 --> 24:28.031
of properly
treating the patient.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.511
You can't cure her cancer.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.035
Unless you have some kind
of superpower

24:32.079 --> 24:33.602
that you haven't told me about.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.822
- Of course not. But if I can
make it easier for her,

24:35.865 --> 24:37.954
I think I should do that,
I think I should do that.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.696
- Feeling like the patients
need you.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.525
Like if you aren't the one
taking care of them,

24:43.569 --> 24:45.309
then they won't be okay?

24:45.353 --> 24:47.703
That's ego, Leblanc.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.880
Do you not trust your colleagues
on the evening shift?

24:50.924 --> 24:53.666
Does nothing really get done
around here
without you doing it?

24:53.709 --> 24:54.971
- Of course, I trust them.
- Good.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.104
Then let them do their jobs.
You go home,

24:57.147 --> 25:00.803
you preserve yourself
for tomorrow's patients.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.413
- Mm-hmm.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.721
- Please if you could
just explain to your supervisor

25:05.765 --> 25:07.767
this is a question of life
and death.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.465
Si muerte. Vida y muerte.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.816
Necesitamos hablar
con el piloto?

25:14.295 --> 25:15.818
Gracias.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.603
Okay, huh...

25:17.646 --> 25:20.388
the parents have switched
to a regional airline
within Argentina,

25:20.431 --> 25:23.609
we're doing our best
to find somebody who can radio
the pilot directly,

25:23.652 --> 25:26.350
but this...
this could take ages.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.569
Si.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.440
No, el piloto.

25:29.484 --> 25:34.402
- I saw so many places,
it's only ever people
bidding up the rent.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.099
- You know it was the same
for us.

25:36.143 --> 25:39.015
We didn't find anything until
after I started washing dishes

25:39.059 --> 25:41.104
and the owner knew someone
with a vacancy.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.759
- Then I better hurry up
and meet some people.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.283
- Knowing you, that won't be
too hard.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.763
[chuckling]

25:47.807 --> 25:51.593
- Bashir, I got this for you.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.903
[gentle music]
- Hey...

26:14.355 --> 26:16.575
Right before they took you.

26:23.669 --> 26:26.149
[high-pitched note]

26:26.497 --> 26:28.587
- Bashir?

26:29.065 --> 26:31.024
Where did you just go?

26:31.067 --> 26:32.895
- I... um...

26:32.939 --> 26:34.636
[pager beeping]

26:34.680 --> 26:37.857
Um, I have to get back.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.338
- Uh, Bashir,
I want you to know

26:41.382 --> 26:43.689
we don't have to jump
into anything.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.821
We can take our time.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.608
- Thank you for the plant.

26:53.481 --> 26:57.659
- Amira texted me about needing
a chaperone home from dance.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.835
I know it's not what
you wanted this morning,

26:59.879 --> 27:02.055
but she was so excited.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.579
- You said yes.
- Yeah.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.755
[chuckling]

27:11.760 --> 27:14.197
- Doctor Atwater? Hi!

27:14.241 --> 27:16.373
So, huh...

27:16.417 --> 27:21.248
it's none of my business
why you did or didn't get
the Acting Chief position.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.511
And I shouldn't have asked.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.644
- But you still wanna know.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.866
All they told me...

27:30.910 --> 27:34.391
was that the role would be
going to someone more suited

27:34.435 --> 27:36.480
to the leadership
opportunity.

27:37.133 --> 27:40.571
- So in other words, a man.
[Atwater scoffs]

27:40.615 --> 27:43.400
- When I was where you are now,
Doctor Curtis,

27:43.444 --> 27:45.402
that was my curse.

27:45.446 --> 27:46.839
Now it's being too old.

27:46.882 --> 27:49.145
But, uh...
there is a silver lining.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.800
There is a freedom
in not having to worry

27:51.844 --> 27:53.933
about playing
the game anymore.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.460
But if you have bigger goals
for yourself, Doctor Curtis,

27:59.503 --> 28:00.940
don't make my mistakes.

28:01.549 --> 28:04.987
I played by everyone else's
rules and look where it got me.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.734
[knocking]

28:12.778 --> 28:15.041
- Navin's MRI was negative
for AVM,

28:15.084 --> 28:19.088
but the electrophysiology
did detect a rare abnormal
heart pattern so,

28:19.132 --> 28:21.047
my hunch was wrong,
but yours was correct.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.005
- Differential, Doctor Hamed?
- Well, taking his rhythm

28:23.049 --> 28:25.268
within the context
of his wider symptoms,

28:25.312 --> 28:27.488
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
is an option.

28:27.531 --> 28:31.274
- But then, wouldn't we have
seen scarring on imaging
of his myocardium?

28:31.318 --> 28:34.234
- Most likely we're looking
at a range of genetic disorders.

28:34.277 --> 28:38.542
Not DND, Romano-Ward syndrome
is possible but, uh...

28:38.586 --> 28:40.414
something is...

28:40.457 --> 28:43.025
- For those kinds
of inherited disorders,
we'd need genetic testing.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.549
- Unless there was another
marker to narrow it down.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.291
- What about his lineage?
- I did ask.

28:48.335 --> 28:51.773
He's Canadian, but his parents
are from Kerala, India.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.777
- Huh... After my residency
I did a stint
in northern Sri Lanka.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.736
Based out of a refugee camp

28:57.779 --> 29:00.129
which was overflowing
with displaced people.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.044
Malnutrition, infection,
dysentery.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.568
But there were
some doctors here that told me
about this young man

29:04.612 --> 29:08.877
who presented with one,
remarkably hyper-dramatic
symptom.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.445
Sudden cardiac death.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.754
- Brugada Syndrome,
prevalent in South Asian men.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.233
[chuckling]

29:17.277 --> 29:19.235
- Well done, doctor.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.500
Won't be as much fun
telling the patient though.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.330
- No, but my mother and father
are completely healthy.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.811
- You can live asymptomatic
your whole life.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.508
That's why it's so dangerous.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.555
- Okay. The beating sounds
I was hearing in my ears.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.600
- Might have been your body
warning you.

29:36.644 --> 29:40.691
Or could just as easily
be unrelated and temporary, like
tinnitus usually is.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.171
[sighing]

29:42.215 --> 29:46.175
- Genetic. That means this heart
defect can't be cured?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.134
- Unfortunately no.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.093
But it can be managed.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.009
And there is somebody
from Cardiology coming later

29:54.053 --> 29:56.707
to talk to you about an
implanted defibrillator device

29:56.751 --> 29:58.884
to avoid another episode.

30:01.147 --> 30:05.064
- Do you know what I did today,
after coming back to life?

30:05.107 --> 30:08.545
I... sat here,

30:08.589 --> 30:10.243
hooked up to these wires,

30:10.286 --> 30:13.420
and I sent work emails
and I managed files.

30:13.463 --> 30:17.206
- After what you went through,
it's normal...

30:17.772 --> 30:19.556
to want a distraction.

30:20.470 --> 30:23.212
- What if my whole life was
the distraction?

30:23.256 --> 30:26.302
There wasn't a single person
that I could think of

30:26.346 --> 30:27.869
to ask down here.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
Why would they come?

30:29.915 --> 30:32.918
I never made space for anyone.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.051
[Theo]: Dammit.
[Mags]: What?

30:36.095 --> 30:38.140
- They cancelled the 9 PM.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.316
And even if I could
get out of here for the 7,

30:40.360 --> 30:41.752
which I can't, it's full.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.145
- You can't fly home tomorrow?

30:43.189 --> 30:45.060
- I'm supposed to be back
tomorrow.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.454
Okay. I'll just...
it's fine.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.238
I'll drive.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.806
Which means I need to finish
my reports before I go.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.939
- You sure you can keep
this pace up?

30:54.461 --> 30:56.593
- I chose this, so it's, uh...

30:56.637 --> 30:58.595
on me to make it work
for my family.

30:58.639 --> 31:01.250
- Okay but this solution?
You running yourself empty?

31:01.294 --> 31:03.905
Is that really what they need
or is it just about you?

31:05.037 --> 31:07.778
[pager beeping]
- If you're saying I should stop
trying to see my kids--

31:07.822 --> 31:09.780
- I don't know
what I'm saying.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.826
I gotta go.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.221
- Deena, Deena! Hey.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.049
I'm right here, come on.
Come back to me, Deena.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.528
- Her labs?
- Her breath is short.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.574
Like she's gasping for air.
- Deena, can you hear me?

31:20.617 --> 31:22.010
Nod if you can hear me.

31:22.054 --> 31:24.143
- She was confused
and then I couldn't wake her.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.927
- I can hear arrhythmia,
pulmonary edema. Labs?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.233
- Come on, Deena!

31:27.711 --> 31:30.105
- Her creatinine levels spiked.
Potassium's at eight.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.020
- What does that mean?
- Acute kidney failure.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.501
She needs them flushed.
Call dialysis. We'll be there
in 60 seconds!

31:34.544 --> 31:36.068
I need help!
- Deena, come on!

31:36.111 --> 31:37.417
- Alright, we're ready!

31:38.026 --> 31:40.899
- I'm right here, Deena,
I'm right here!

31:42.161 --> 31:44.859
It's okay! It's okay!
I'm right here.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.646
[car honking]

31:49.690 --> 31:52.432
- We've done everything we can
to try to reach your folks.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.738
- It should be them here,
not me.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.959
- It's not about that, okay?
It's about what Carly needs.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.265
- I don't know what she needs!

31:59.308 --> 32:01.397
You're her doctor,
you should know.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.443
- I can help treat her,
Hannah,

32:03.486 --> 32:05.575
but Carly doesn't have a voice
right now.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.577
And she needs one
and that voice is you.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.884
So clear your head.
Let's talk this through.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.756
And I'd do the same thing
with your parents
if they were here right now.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.237
- The trans-cath-thing...

32:15.281 --> 32:17.848
- Transcatheter embolization.

32:18.893 --> 32:23.289
- So that means that
you get to the wound
through her blood vessels.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.725
- Exactly, yeah.
You, uh...

32:24.768 --> 32:26.553
the coils are threaded
through her femoral--

32:26.596 --> 32:28.468
- Where you cauterize it,
instead of opening

32:28.511 --> 32:30.992
and sewing because
there could be too much blood.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.733
- Yeah, that's right.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.039
You looked it up?

32:34.082 --> 32:35.910
[scoffs]
- Um...

32:35.954 --> 32:37.956
And you think that
that's the best option?

32:37.999 --> 32:40.654
- I do. The risks are primarily
around...

32:40.697 --> 32:42.482
bleeding in the brain
and stroke,

32:42.525 --> 32:46.007
but Carly's young,
she's strong.

32:46.051 --> 32:49.315
We've heard from
her pediatrician
about her medical history,

32:49.358 --> 32:52.840
but you might know about
other risk factors
that run in the family.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.016
High blood pressure?
Heart disease?

32:55.060 --> 32:56.800
- My grandpa had a stroke.

32:56.844 --> 33:00.152
He used to get bad migraines.
Carly does too.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.502
- That's exactly the kind
of thing we need to know. Good!

33:02.545 --> 33:04.852
- Does that mean
she can't have the surgery?

33:04.895 --> 33:09.030
- No, it just means that
the surgeons now know
to look out for that risk.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.336
- Okay.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.946
Okay.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.646
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

33:17.908 --> 33:19.040
[knocking]

33:19.084 --> 33:20.389
- Doctor Bishop?

33:20.433 --> 33:22.174
Claire said I should take you
to rehab?

33:22.217 --> 33:23.653
[sighing]

33:23.697 --> 33:25.699
- Your services will not be
necessary.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.701
[chuckling]
- Claire also said
you might say that

33:27.744 --> 33:29.964
and I should remind you
that--

33:30.486 --> 33:32.401
Never mind.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.017
[exhaling deeply]

33:40.453 --> 33:42.716
[gentle music]

33:42.759 --> 33:45.023
[indistinct conversations]

33:49.766 --> 33:51.638
[hubbub]

33:53.422 --> 33:55.468
[Novak laughs]

33:56.208 --> 33:57.948
[pager beeping]

34:11.571 --> 34:14.487
[dramatic music]

34:15.313 --> 34:16.619
- What happened to Navin?

34:16.663 --> 34:18.186
- His vitals tanked out
of nowhere

34:18.230 --> 34:19.708
and he started crashing.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.885
[machine beeping]

34:21.929 --> 34:24.018
- Clear!

34:26.324 --> 34:28.588
[panting]
Resuming compressions.

34:33.505 --> 34:37.771
- I want to see you make it into
the artery on your first stick,
Doctor Harris, let's go.

34:37.813 --> 34:39.425
- Catheter.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.775
- That's the doctor
from before, right?

34:41.818 --> 34:44.125
Why isn't she doing
the operation?

34:44.821 --> 34:47.737
She's the one who helped
when Carly came in.

34:47.781 --> 34:50.565
- Doctor Curtis isn't part of
the vascular team.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.742
She's there in case
there's a complication.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.744
- When will we know?
If it worked?

34:54.788 --> 34:57.051
- Not until it's over.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.099
- Stopping compressions.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.450
No, we're not giving up
on this guy.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.887
Not yet.
- How long?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.019
- 27 minutes.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.239
- Come on, Navin.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.111
- From like ninth grade,

35:13.154 --> 35:16.462
people are asking you
to make these big decisions
about your life.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.898
Carly's lucky,

35:17.941 --> 35:20.205
she always knew
exactly what she wanted.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.771
What if I don't?

35:21.815 --> 35:24.078
- There's nothing wrong
with not having it all together.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.211
In fact being able to admit
that you don't?

35:26.254 --> 35:28.691
That's its own kind of skill.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.044
- Come on, Navin.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.744
[panting]

35:40.834 --> 35:43.837
- There's nothing more
we could have done for him.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.756
Fate was coming for this guy.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.415
- Time of death, 4:25 PM.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.678
[gentle music]

36:04.684 --> 36:05.815
- What's that?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.687
Your friend needs
another consult?

36:07.730 --> 36:09.384
- Uh, no, we lost a patient.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.604
His phone has locked and
I have no idea who to call.

36:11.647 --> 36:12.996
- Social worker.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.085
Ask the social worker.

36:15.129 --> 36:16.957
- Thank you.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.220
- I heard your bleeder
came through.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.744
How was that,
making the vascular save?

36:21.788 --> 36:23.268
- It wasn't.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.401
- Doctor Curtis.
You can't turn down

36:26.445 --> 36:28.316
an opportunity to show
the bosses what you're made of.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.144
You keep waiting in the line

36:30.188 --> 36:31.754
and your chance is never
gonna come.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.627
You gotta believe in yourself.
- Yeah, I know what I need.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.587
- You did me a huge favour
and I really appreciate it.

36:38.631 --> 36:41.024
It's just that other residents
were promised

36:41.068 --> 36:44.202
OR time ahead of me
and I need to respect that.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.248
- Carry on, then.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.518
- Surgeons needed to thread
this tiny coil

36:56.562 --> 36:59.347
through Carly's artery so they
could cauterize the bleeding.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.654
But they said she came through
like a star.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.525
[woman on the phone]:
Oh, thank God. I'm so relieved.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.572
- She's so brave, Mom,
so strong.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.443
- So are you, honey.

37:08.487 --> 37:09.879
[sighing]

37:09.923 --> 37:11.794
- I was a pretty big mess
actually.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.318
- But you did it.

37:13.361 --> 37:16.277
Your sister is lucky
you were there for her today.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.106
I am so proud of you.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.241
- Uh, her doctor should
explain the rest.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.550
- Hannah has it covered,
Miss Miller,

37:28.594 --> 37:31.249
she's almost ready
to take over for me.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.730
- They never should have
had to do this without us.

37:34.774 --> 37:37.603
[sighing]
- But they got through it
together.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.388
You have two great kids here.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.439
- Carly.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.137
Hi.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.531
[gentle music]

38:05.021 --> 38:06.936
[phones ringing]

38:07.589 --> 38:10.200
- You responded quickly
to the dialysis.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.506
Which is good news.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.247
The chemotherapy poisons
your body,

38:13.291 --> 38:14.857
which is what it's supposed
to do to fight the cancer,

38:14.901 --> 38:17.295
but sometimes the kidneys,
they just can't keep up.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.035
- We knew it was a risk.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.994
- So we're keeping you
overnight

38:21.037 --> 38:23.431
and I spoke
with your oncologist

38:23.475 --> 38:27.435
and she says that Deena's
treatment will have
to be suspended.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.701
- McKinney's taking us off
chemo?

38:35.008 --> 38:36.749
When can she go back on?

38:36.792 --> 38:39.882
- That's something you'll need
to discuss with her.

38:41.884 --> 38:45.453
- Are you saying
there's a possibility
she can't get back on?

38:45.497 --> 38:48.413
- She's saying
it's not her call.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.198
- I'm sorry, guys.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.505
I'm gonna give you some time.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.207
- Mags?

39:01.077 --> 39:04.167
Mags.
Can you come back?

39:04.211 --> 39:06.648
We need you to talk us
through this.

39:06.692 --> 39:10.522
- I know this is difficult,
I'm sorry.

39:10.565 --> 39:13.742
But Doctor McKinney will be
here in the morning
with next steps.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.180
- I'm worried that she's not
gonna want to keep fighting
through this.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.400
I know you can make her
see reason.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.750
- She doesn't need me, Ephraim.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.578
She needs you.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.408
Now the night shift
has Deena's med plan

39:27.452 --> 39:29.932
and they know to call me
if anything is unclear.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.370
Go be with her.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.894
- Okay.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.765
Okay.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.644
- It's gonna take me five hours
with traffic.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.951
- Oh, hey.
Are you technically still here?

39:48.995 --> 39:50.736
Kid with the asthma attack
just...

39:50.779 --> 39:52.651
I can get a resident,
it's totally okay.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.348
- I'm here.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.544
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

40:16.588 --> 40:18.938
- Oh, just...

40:18.981 --> 40:21.593
Just preserving myself
for tomorrow's patients.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.030
- Should I be nervous
for them?

40:24.073 --> 40:27.599
- I just left my bag in here,
but I just...

40:27.642 --> 40:30.384
- Are you actually going home
before the sun sets today?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.255
[Mags sighs]
- Yep.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.170
Even though all I'm gonna
be doing there

40:34.214 --> 40:36.912
is think about what else
I could be doing here.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.089
- Long day?
- Yeah.

40:40.133 --> 40:43.223
Did you figure out why
your auto-resus patient coded?

40:43.266 --> 40:44.703
- Brugada Syndrome.

40:44.746 --> 40:48.446
But uh, it...
it happened again.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.883
- He died?

40:53.973 --> 40:56.236
I'm so sorry, Bash.

40:57.585 --> 41:01.502
- You know he didn't even
realize what his life was
missing until today.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.418
[sighing]

41:07.073 --> 41:09.771
- It's a nice plant.
- Yeah.

41:09.815 --> 41:13.383
Jasmines.
They're loved in Syria.

41:13.427 --> 41:15.081
A friend gave it to me.

41:15.124 --> 41:16.822
- Pretty.

41:19.651 --> 41:23.393
- She was my fiancÃ©e
back home.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.310
And... she's here now.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.792
- Oh, wow.

41:31.924 --> 41:33.273
That's incredible.

41:33.316 --> 41:36.581
- I, uh, I haven't really told
anyone yet so...

41:36.624 --> 41:38.974
- No, I mean, yeah.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.455
[chuckling]
Yeah, of course.

41:41.499 --> 41:45.503
Well, congratulations.
I'm really happy for you.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.114
I'm gonna go before I...

41:48.157 --> 41:51.465
you know, talk myself
into picking up another shift.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.119
- Mags.

41:56.470 --> 41:59.125
Try to keep your mind
off work tonight?

41:59.168 --> 42:00.343
- Yeah.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.130
[door closing]

42:11.659 --> 42:13.008
[high-pitched sound]

42:13.052 --> 42:15.184
[foreign language]

42:22.670 --> 42:24.324
- Bashir Hamed.

42:44.387 --> 42:45.911
[loud knocking]

42:47.347 --> 42:49.218
[shuddering]
