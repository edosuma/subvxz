01:06.510 --> 01:12.480
<i>Poa! Nothing better than the feel
of squishy mud under your feet.</i>

01:12.520 --> 01:16.250
Except maybe the feel
of no mud under your feet.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.490
After last night's
big storm,

01:18.520 --> 01:20.660
I'm glad the mud
is our only problem.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.260
That's what he thinks!

01:24.290 --> 01:27.100
Everything's going
exactly as planned.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.130
You mean you planned for
the Lion Guard to be here?

01:30.170 --> 01:34.070
No! I planned to go after
those wildebeests.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.140
With all this mud,
they'll never outrun us.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.910
Wait.
You planned on the mud?

01:39.940 --> 01:42.580
Did you make it rain?

01:42.610 --> 01:45.110
No, fur-brain! Look.

01:45.150 --> 01:49.650
We just gotta wait for the
Lion Guard to clear out...

01:49.690 --> 01:54.060
And now it's lunchtime.
C'mon, fellas!

01:56.690 --> 01:58.530
Uh-oh.

02:04.530 --> 02:07.840
Well, look who it is.
The Lion Guard!

02:07.870 --> 02:10.370
What are you guys doin'
in the Outlands?

02:10.410 --> 02:12.140
Nice try, Janja.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.710
We both know this is
the Pride Lands.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.510
And you don't belong here.

02:16.550 --> 02:17.910
Yeah, yeah...

02:19.920 --> 02:22.280
That was fun!

02:22.320 --> 02:24.150
C'mon, fellas, let's go.

02:24.190 --> 02:26.390
It's too muddy
around here, anyway.

02:26.420 --> 02:29.360
But, Janja, I thought
you liked the mud!

02:29.390 --> 02:34.760
Yeah! 'Cause it slows down
the wilde... The wilde...

02:34.800 --> 02:36.130
Wildebeests?

02:36.170 --> 02:37.900
Yeah! Them!

02:37.940 --> 02:39.800
We was gonna have 'em
for lunch!

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
Fur-brains! Shh!

02:42.040 --> 02:44.770
The mud might slow down
the wildebeests.

02:44.810 --> 02:47.380
But I don't think
it's gonna slow you down.

02:55.790 --> 02:57.350
Get off of me, fur-brains!

02:57.390 --> 03:00.290
Another plan ruined!
And do you know why?

03:00.320 --> 03:02.260
'Cause you slipped on the mud?

03:02.290 --> 03:04.890
And slided into the Lion Guard?

03:04.930 --> 03:07.100
No! It's because of you two!

03:07.130 --> 03:08.630
<i>Us?</i>

03:08.670 --> 03:10.800
That's right! Every time I come up with

03:10.801 --> 03:12.930
a brilliant plan, you two mess it up!

03:12.970 --> 03:14.140
We do?

03:14.170 --> 03:17.270
Uh... I thought we
messed it up together.

03:17.310 --> 03:19.470
Yeah!
We're great at that!

03:19.510 --> 03:22.440
You know what?
I can't take it anymore.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.180
You're both fired!

03:27.720 --> 03:32.190
Weren't you two fur-brains listening?
I said you're fired!

03:32.220 --> 03:33.420
We're on fire?

03:33.460 --> 03:34.660
Ahhh!

03:34.690 --> 03:37.460
I don't even smell smoke!

03:37.490 --> 03:40.500
You're not "on fire."
You are fired!

03:40.530 --> 03:43.000
It means you're finished.
You're done. You're through.

03:43.030 --> 03:44.700
I don't need ya!

03:44.740 --> 03:47.170
Of course, you don't need us!

03:47.200 --> 03:50.540
Yeah!
Yo, what's the new plan?

03:50.570 --> 03:53.340
There ain't no new plan!
You're not in the crew anymore!

03:53.380 --> 03:55.840
Get out of the Outlands!

03:55.880 --> 03:58.650
You two, I'm giving you
a promotion.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.220
Okay.
Thanks.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.150
And here's your first job...

04:02.190 --> 04:04.590
Get rid of those two
fur-brains!

04:04.620 --> 04:05.990
You got it, boss!

04:06.020 --> 04:07.290
You heard Janja.

04:08.930 --> 04:10.090
Get lost!

04:10.130 --> 04:12.490
Uh, sure! No problem!

04:12.530 --> 04:15.660
Yeah. We're lost most
of the time already!

04:19.670 --> 04:23.370
Remind me again, why are we
slogging through all this mud?

04:23.410 --> 04:25.110
We gotta make sure
all the trails

04:25.140 --> 04:27.740
in the Pride Lands are safe
after the big rainstorm.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.510
Uh-oh.

04:29.550 --> 04:31.280
And that
includes this one!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.080
Mudslide!

04:34.120 --> 04:35.320
Everybody! Run!

04:36.320 --> 04:38.190
<i> Hapana!
Hyah!</i>

04:42.830 --> 04:45.430
Okay. So this trail
isn't safe.

04:45.460 --> 04:48.560
But this is the main path from
Big Springs to Mekundu Cliffs.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.000
Everyone uses it!

04:50.030 --> 04:52.670
So we'll need to clear it
and make it safe again.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.370
Ono, Bunga. Keep everyone off
this trail till we're done.

04:56.410 --> 05:00.340
- Affirmative!
- You got it, Kion!

05:00.380 --> 05:02.310
Fuli, Beshte.
You're with me.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.080
We have to get all these trees
and boulders off this trail.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.210
Sure thing!

05:06.250 --> 05:08.720
Well, if I have to get muddy,

05:08.750 --> 05:10.890
might as well do it
for a good cause!

05:12.260 --> 05:13.860
That's the spirit, Fuli!

05:16.190 --> 05:18.030
<i>All right, you twos, listen up.</i>

05:18.060 --> 05:20.530
Now that you're my
seconds-in-command,

05:20.560 --> 05:22.300
you gotta learn the rules.

05:22.330 --> 05:25.930
Rule number one, I am
the smartest hyena around!

05:25.970 --> 05:27.100
Rule number three...

05:27.140 --> 05:28.400
What about rule number two?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.710
What about it?
What is it?

05:33.140 --> 05:34.910
Forget the rules!

05:34.950 --> 05:37.850
The main thing is, I come up
with the plans, and you guys...

05:37.880 --> 05:40.950
Actually, Janja,
we already have a plan.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.420
What? Didn't I just tell you
I'm the one who...

05:43.450 --> 05:45.090
It's an awesome plan!

05:45.120 --> 05:46.320
How awesome?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.220
Okay, this is a herd
of antelopes.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.890
No, it's not!
It's a bone!

05:51.930 --> 05:53.700
Shh!

05:53.730 --> 05:57.400
- First, we stampede them in this direction.
- Right.

05:57.430 --> 06:01.040
And then the Lion Guard comes in
and runs off after the antelopes.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.010
Oh, I get it! And then
we come home hungry!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.910
That sounds like
one of my plans!

06:05.940 --> 06:07.280
No, see?

06:07.310 --> 06:10.450
After they run off,
we find a herd of oryxes.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.180
Wait, those are oryxes?

06:12.220 --> 06:15.080
And we chase them
in a different direction!

06:15.120 --> 06:17.870
Then we catch the oryxes
over here, while

06:18.170 --> 06:20.920
the Lion Guard's still busy with
the antelopes over there!

06:21.390 --> 06:23.390
Uh-huh.

06:23.430 --> 06:24.590
Uh, well, good plan.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.160
Yeah! Finally.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.100
Hyenas who got
smarts like me.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.770
Those other fur-brains never
knew what they were doing.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.930
Just like some other
hyenas we know.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.170
Right.

06:35.210 --> 06:39.940
Still not sure why we're givin'
up a nice, juicy bone for a rock.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.180
<i>Excuse me!</i>

06:42.210 --> 06:43.610
Oh, goodness!

06:43.650 --> 06:45.950
Sorry, didn't mean
to startle you.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.550
You might not
want to go this way.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.480
But I have to
get to Big Springs.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.350
Oh, gotta go around!

06:51.390 --> 06:53.150
Big mudslide up ahead.

06:53.190 --> 06:54.560
It's a mess!

06:54.590 --> 06:56.790
Oh, I see what you mean.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.030
Thanks for the heads-up.

07:00.060 --> 07:02.800
"Heads-up." Good one.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.330
You're a giraffe.

07:04.370 --> 07:06.670
Your head couldn't
get more up!

07:09.210 --> 07:10.970
Um...
Don't mind him.

07:11.580 --> 07:12.670
Ooh!

07:12.710 --> 07:15.010
Wait till Beshte
hears that one.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:18.180 --> 07:19.310
Slow down there.

07:19.350 --> 07:22.050
Hello?
I'm trying to get through.

07:22.090 --> 07:23.590
Step aside.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.290
You don't understand.
There's a mudslide up ahead and...

07:26.320 --> 07:29.160
You don't understand.
You're in my way!

07:30.160 --> 07:31.490
Well, we tried.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.790
Maybe he'll get
through okay.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.260
<i>Excuse me!</i>

07:35.300 --> 07:36.560
Or maybe not.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.430
A little help here?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.310
Hey, are those two guys
still chasing us?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.740
Nuh-uh.

07:47.780 --> 07:51.450
Hey! I don't think we're
in the Outlands anymore.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.280
Oh, yeah!

07:53.320 --> 07:55.650
Ooh. We're in
the Pride Lands!

07:58.190 --> 08:01.890
That means we did what
Janja told us to do!

08:01.930 --> 08:04.160
You think we should
go back and tell him?

08:04.190 --> 08:05.690
Yeah, yeah!

08:05.730 --> 08:07.160
No, wait.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.630
He said we ain't
in his crew no more.

08:09.670 --> 08:12.700
But he's still our boss, right?

08:12.740 --> 08:14.600
Uh, I don't think so.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.970
Oh, who's gonna
tell us what to do?

08:18.010 --> 08:21.310
Who's gonna
call us fur-brains?

08:21.340 --> 08:23.880
Maybe we could do it!

08:23.910 --> 08:26.310
I'm hungry, fur-brains!

08:26.350 --> 08:30.290
Oh, yeah.
Me, too, fur-brain!

08:34.860 --> 08:36.690
It just ain't the same.

08:36.730 --> 08:38.530
♪ Why ♪

08:38.559 --> 08:42.000
♪ Why did he tell us to go? ♪

08:42.030 --> 08:46.200
♪ The only family we know ♪

08:46.240 --> 08:49.340

08:56.550 --> 08:59.010
♪ And who... ♪
Oh, look, antelope!

08:59.050 --> 09:01.820
That's what
Janja would have us do.

09:01.850 --> 09:02.950
Hunt antelope!

09:04.720 --> 09:06.450
And you know what he'd say?

09:06.490 --> 09:09.960
Uh, "Get those
antelopes, fur-brain."

09:12.500 --> 09:14.530
Okay, I'll go this way.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.730
Yeah, and you'll go that way.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.870
I thought you was
goin' that way!

09:24.910 --> 09:27.240
And I thought you was
goin' this way!

09:28.580 --> 09:30.510
And which way did they go?

09:30.550 --> 09:33.450
I don't think
I like the Pride Lands.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.850
Me neither.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.020
Nothin' stands still
and lets you eat it.

09:37.050 --> 09:39.020
It's not fair!

09:40.290 --> 09:42.690
Well...

09:42.730 --> 09:44.860
We could eat leftovers!

09:44.890 --> 09:46.090
Oh, yeah!

09:46.130 --> 09:47.430
They don't move.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.200
You know what?

09:53.240 --> 09:56.170
I think I like the
Pride Lands after all!

09:58.070 --> 09:59.570
Yeah! Me, too!

10:09.420 --> 10:11.150
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

10:13.520 --> 10:15.590
Phew! There we go.

10:15.630 --> 10:16.690
Last one.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.130
Great job, Beshte.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.330
Looks like the trail's
safe to use again.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.430
At least till
the next big rain.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.270
Does that mean
we can take a break?

10:24.300 --> 10:26.630
Little B?
What happened to you?

10:26.670 --> 10:27.970
Would you believe a zebra?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.870
I'd believe it.

10:29.910 --> 10:32.310
Hey, Big B! Wait till you
hear what the giraffe said

10:32.340 --> 10:33.980
when we told her
about the mudslide!

10:34.010 --> 10:35.480
What's that, Little B?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.850
She said, "Thanks for
sticking your neck out!"

10:39.720 --> 10:41.080
No, wait. That's not right.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.420
- She said...
- Heads up!

10:42.450 --> 10:43.580
Was that it?

10:43.620 --> 10:44.890
No, I mean, heads up!

10:44.920 --> 10:46.220
I just spotted something!

10:46.260 --> 10:47.420
What'd you see, Ono?

10:47.460 --> 10:48.790
Two animals in trouble.

10:48.830 --> 10:49.960
Let's go!

10:49.990 --> 10:51.660
Till the Pride Lands end...

10:51.690 --> 10:53.530
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

10:55.370 --> 10:57.570
Hurry! They're headed
for the canyon's edge!

10:57.600 --> 10:59.100
Beshte, block their path.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.540
You got it, Kion!

11:00.570 --> 11:02.870
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

11:03.670 --> 11:04.970
Hold steady, Beshte!

11:05.010 --> 11:07.140
Here they come!

11:12.350 --> 11:14.650
Bunga, you help
the smaller one.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.250
Fuli, we'll grab
the big one.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.620
I gotcha.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.830
Whoa! You're
pretty heavy for a...

11:28.600 --> 11:30.230
Whatever you are.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.810
That was close.
Are you two all right?

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
What? You two?

11:41.880 --> 11:44.780
- Is it?
- I... guess so.

11:44.810 --> 11:48.220
If you're here, then
Janja's here, too. Ono?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.820
On it.

11:49.850 --> 11:52.220
Janja's here?
Do you see him?

11:52.260 --> 11:54.190
Ooh, ooh!
Maybe he's come back.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.777
Yeah!
Maybe he's gonna let us back

11:56.854 --> 11:59.130
- into the Outlands!
- Wait, what?

11:59.160 --> 12:02.030
Janja kicked us
outta the Outlands.

12:02.070 --> 12:04.470
We ain't on his crew no more.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.200
You really expect us
to believe that?

12:07.240 --> 12:10.270
He said we always
messed things up!

12:10.310 --> 12:12.470
Okay, that I believe.

12:12.510 --> 12:14.780
Now he's got
two new guys.

12:14.810 --> 12:17.910
Yeah. Nne and Tano.

12:17.950 --> 12:20.920
And they're mean
and ugly!

12:23.790 --> 12:25.190
No sign of Janja.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.290
So what are we gonna do
with these two?

12:29.330 --> 12:31.330
Well, they can't stay here.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.730
You two have to go back
to the Outlands.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.560
But we can't go back!

12:35.600 --> 12:38.630
If we do, Janja's new crew
will just kick us out...

12:38.670 --> 12:40.740
<i>Again.</i>

12:40.770 --> 12:43.800
You know, Kion. I don't see these
two guys causing much trouble.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.510
Yeah. They're not
smart enough.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.170
Hey, thanks!

12:47.210 --> 12:49.110
Yeah, you got that right!

12:49.150 --> 12:50.550
See what I mean?

12:50.580 --> 12:53.550
But what if they chase after
the herds like Janja always does?

12:53.580 --> 12:56.120
Why would we do that?

12:56.150 --> 13:00.320
When there's leftovers
lying all over the place?

13:02.730 --> 13:04.360
Maybe we should
let them stay.

13:04.390 --> 13:06.530
After all,
hyenas are scavengers.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.000
By cleaning up
after everyone,

13:08.030 --> 13:09.130
they'd actually
be helping

13:09.170 --> 13:11.130
the Circle of Life
in the Pride Lands.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.000
Hmm. Maybe you're right, Ono.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.170
And I guess letting them stay
would be the nice thing to do.

13:17.470 --> 13:19.210
Feels weird, though.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.080
Okay. As long as you two
don't cause any trouble,

13:23.110 --> 13:24.580
you can stay
in the Pride Lands.

13:25.580 --> 13:27.280
Gee, thanks!

13:27.320 --> 13:28.880
Don't make us regret it.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.790
Let's get back
to our patrol.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.890
Ono, check in on them
every once in a while.

13:36.930 --> 13:39.660
I still think this might be
one of Janja's plans.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.330
Affirmative.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.330
You hear what they
said about us?

13:43.370 --> 13:47.170
Yeah. We're helping
with the Circle of Life.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.870
Feels kinda good, don't it?

13:49.910 --> 13:52.340
Uh, what's
the Circle of Life again?

13:52.380 --> 13:54.240
I do not know.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.240
But if it means lots
of leftovers, I like it!

14:00.750 --> 14:01.920
What's that?

14:04.250 --> 14:05.820
<i> Hapana!</i>

14:05.860 --> 14:08.220
Problem, Ono?
Is it those two hyenas?

14:08.260 --> 14:11.760
No, a herd of antelope is
stampeding in the rocky plains!

14:11.790 --> 14:13.290
Lead the way, Ono!

14:13.330 --> 14:15.030
Till the Pride Lands end...

14:15.060 --> 14:17.130
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

14:25.940 --> 14:29.010
That's it, boys.

14:29.050 --> 14:30.480
We've almost got 'em.

14:32.150 --> 14:34.250
And I can almost
taste them.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.890
Hey! You're letting
them get away!

14:40.920 --> 14:42.390
Don't you remember
the plan?

14:42.430 --> 14:44.030
We do. Do you?

14:44.060 --> 14:46.860
'Course I do!
Uh... I think.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.200
Okay, listen.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.500
The plan is to... Uh-oh!

14:53.040 --> 14:55.400
Guys! What are you...

14:55.440 --> 14:57.740
Ono, did you see
what made them run?

14:57.770 --> 14:58.940
I didn't.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.810
Doesn't matter.
I think I know.

15:02.850 --> 15:05.610
Come on! We gotta catch
that herd and calm 'em down!

15:09.690 --> 15:13.350
Oh, great! The Lion Guard
spoiled the plan. Again!

15:13.390 --> 15:15.960
No. The plan's
working perfectly.

15:15.990 --> 15:19.390
It is? What kinda plan
lets the Lion Guard win?

15:19.430 --> 15:21.660
Janja, they're not winning.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.830
They're doing exactly
what we want them to do.

15:24.870 --> 15:27.570
Did you even listen when
we explained the plan?

15:27.600 --> 15:32.840
Sure I did. It's all about
rocks and leaves and... Stuff.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.740
We scared off
the antelopes

15:34.780 --> 15:37.550
so the Lion Guard
will chase after them.

15:37.580 --> 15:38.980
While they're busy,

15:39.020 --> 15:41.920
we're gonna go after
something else.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.820
In the opposite direction.

15:44.850 --> 15:48.090
So... The antelopes
aren't dinner?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.720
No!

15:49.760 --> 15:51.860
Oh, but I like antelope.

15:51.890 --> 15:53.190
That's dinner.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.670
Ooh! Oryxes!
They're good, too!

15:57.700 --> 15:59.100
Come on, fur-brain!

15:59.140 --> 16:00.530
What'd you call me?

16:00.570 --> 16:03.540
Oh, sorry... Boss.

16:03.570 --> 16:05.540
That's better. I...

16:05.580 --> 16:08.580
Hey! Wait for me! I'm
your leader, remember?

16:09.910 --> 16:12.580
Slow it down.
No need to run.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.520
The Lion Guard's here to help.

16:15.420 --> 16:18.150
Yeah, but help them
with what?

16:18.190 --> 16:20.020
Good question, Little B.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.790
I never did see
anyone chasing them.

16:22.290 --> 16:23.860
Me neither.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.530
You said earlier you've got an
idea what started the stampede.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.560
Yeah. It's all our fault.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.530
What?
How could it be our fault?

16:30.570 --> 16:32.500
I'd never start
a stampede.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.470
We didn't start
the stampede.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.470
But we let Cheezi and Chungu
stay in the Pride Lands.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.370
You think they had
something to do with it?

16:39.410 --> 16:41.140
Either them or Janja.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.040
I caught the scent
of hyenas earlier.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.310
Ono, find Cheezi and Chungu
and lead us to 'em.

16:46.350 --> 16:47.450
On it!

17:01.700 --> 17:03.230
You two fur-brains!

17:03.270 --> 17:05.599
Janja!
Is it really you?

17:05.640 --> 17:07.069
Did you come
looking for us?

17:07.099 --> 17:08.869
Do you want us back?

17:08.910 --> 17:13.109
You kidding? I got two new
hyenas that do everything I say.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.180
They really respect me.

17:15.210 --> 17:17.040
<i>Janja!</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:19.650
You coming?
Just let him stay behind.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.849
See what I mean?

17:24.849 --> 17:26.020
Fellas! Wait up!

17:27.589 --> 17:29.820
Did... Did that
really just happen?

17:29.860 --> 17:31.960
Maybe it was
just a dream.

17:31.990 --> 17:33.590
Yeah, yeah.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.530
I'm gonna dream
about Janja some more.

17:36.570 --> 17:37.870
Me, too.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.740
There's a dead-end
canyon up ahead!

17:45.780 --> 17:46.910
We can trap them there

17:46.940 --> 17:48.780
before the Lion Guard
gets back

17:48.810 --> 17:50.710
from their wild goose chase.

17:50.750 --> 17:51.910
<i>Wild goose?</i>

17:51.950 --> 17:53.410
I thought they were
chasing antelopes.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.750
I thought
we dumped you.

17:54.780 --> 17:56.920
You can't dump me.
I'm the boss.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.690
Oh, yeah?
Watch us.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.360
<i>So long...</i>

18:06.400 --> 18:07.830
Fur-brain!

18:14.870 --> 18:17.740
You still think they started
the antelope stampede?

18:17.770 --> 18:18.970
Let's ask 'em.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.640
Hey!

18:20.680 --> 18:21.940
Okay, you two.

18:21.980 --> 18:23.910
Why'd you start
that stampede?

18:23.950 --> 18:25.250
Stampede?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.910
It wasn't us!

18:26.950 --> 18:29.980
We was busy
dreamin' about Janja!

18:30.020 --> 18:31.990
Yeah, yeah!

18:32.020 --> 18:34.690
Maybe it was Dream Janja that did it!

18:34.720 --> 18:36.460
"Dream Janja"?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.890
<i>Nne! Tano!
Come back here!</i>

18:38.930 --> 18:41.060
That sounds like
the real Janja to me.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.930
I knew it!
Come on!

18:45.800 --> 18:48.000
Janja's really here?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.940
It's a dream come true!

18:51.270 --> 18:53.340
Those double-crossing
no-goods!

18:56.050 --> 18:57.410
Oh, great.

18:57.450 --> 19:00.010
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.320
Why'd you scare off
the antelopes, Janja?

19:02.350 --> 19:03.850
What's your plan?

19:03.890 --> 19:05.650
Bad enough I get
pushed off a cliff.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.490
I ain't gonna take
the blame, too.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.025
It was their idea! The new
guys! Something about getting

19:11.325 --> 19:14.830
you to chase the antelopes
while we chase the oryxes!

19:14.860 --> 19:16.630
Sounds like a
pretty good plan.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.730
Ono!

19:22.610 --> 19:24.640
<i>Hapana!
I see them!</i>

19:24.670 --> 19:27.340
They're chasing the oryxes
into a dead-end canyon!

19:28.740 --> 19:29.910
Lion Guard!

19:29.950 --> 19:31.150
Let's go!

19:31.180 --> 19:32.750
<i>Hey, hey, wait,
where are you going?</i>

19:32.780 --> 19:34.780
You're just gonna
leave me here?

19:34.820 --> 19:37.750
- Don't worry, Janja!
- We won't leave you.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.290
How is this supposed to save me?

19:46.330 --> 19:50.330
Save you?
We weren't trying to save you.

19:50.370 --> 19:53.930
Yeah! We just 
wanna keep you company.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.640
Oh!

20:04.110 --> 20:08.950
Oh, whatcha
staring at, oryxes?

20:08.990 --> 20:11.590
<i>Never seen
smart hyenas before?</i>

20:12.460 --> 20:13.890
They still haven't!

20:19.200 --> 20:20.490
Don't tell me.

20:20.530 --> 20:22.230
The Lion Guard.

20:22.260 --> 20:24.930
And you must be
Janja's new crew.

20:24.970 --> 20:26.770
We're our own crew.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.240
So now what?

20:28.270 --> 20:32.140
You gonna scare us off with the Roar?

20:32.170 --> 20:33.670
You are pretty smart.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.060
That's the first time I was
ever happy to hear that sound.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.530
So, what about Janja?

20:56.570 --> 20:58.300
Can't we just leave
him on the ledge?

20:58.330 --> 20:59.600
I wish.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.400
But we gotta get him
off the ledge

21:01.440 --> 21:03.270
and out of the Pride Lands.

21:03.310 --> 21:06.240
<i>Hmm.
Might not be easy.</i>

21:08.780 --> 21:11.950
Uh, are we sure
this is the right cliff?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.080
Janja? Cheezi? Chungu?

21:14.120 --> 21:15.180
You okay?

21:16.820 --> 21:19.350
Uh, yeah!
I think so.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.120
<i>Okay, then.</i>

21:22.160 --> 21:24.630
It's time for you to go home.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.290
Fine with me.

21:26.330 --> 21:28.400
I've had enough of
this place for one day.

21:31.630 --> 21:34.470
- Hey, you coming?
- Sure, Janja!

21:34.500 --> 21:36.670
We thought you'd never ask!

21:39.540 --> 21:40.940
Oh!

21:40.980 --> 21:42.140
Fur-brains.

21:42.180 --> 21:44.680
That's right, Janja.

21:44.710 --> 21:48.480
- That's what we are.
- Yeah. Thanks.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.290
It means a lot
coming from you.

21:53.860 --> 21:56.020
I love a happy ending.
