WEBVTT

00:20.771 --> 00:23.190
Hey, you're in deep shit.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.737
Harry Barnes, he's heard you're a dog.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.948
Said he's gonna come for you.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.200
I'm not a dog, Ned.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.328
I didn't tell Nightingale a thing.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.539
Well, they think you did.

00:41.959 --> 00:42.960
Just take this.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.800
I never stabbed anyone in my life.
I'm not gonna start now.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.761
Your bloody books, they're not
gonna help you here, right?

00:52.845 --> 00:54.596
Now, just take it, hey?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.235
Barnes, check it out.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.987
G'day, Barnes. How you going?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.158
Look, I know what you've heard,

01:15.242 --> 01:17.911
but that prick Nightingale's only
calling me a dog 'cause I won't talk.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.581
Would I be standing here if I was--

01:23.709 --> 01:26.920
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yes.

01:27.004 --> 01:27.963
Hey. Hey.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.889
I'm gonna kill you, you dog bastard.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.440
Oi!

01:47.441 --> 01:49.234
No, hey!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.457
Get the fuck back.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.713
It's a lie. Nightingale is setting me up.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.424
I am not a dog. Say it.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.551
-Say it!
-You're not a dog.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.802
Say it to them!

02:15.886 --> 02:17.221
He's not a dog.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.855
This ends now. Yeah?

02:36.532 --> 02:39.618
I think we should go back,
find out what the hell is going on.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.330
Nothing good. So until we know,
you need to stay out of sight.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.291
Promise me you'll stay put.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.295
Yeah, all right.

02:50.379 --> 02:54.132
Just do me a favor. Get word to Abdullah.
Have him meet us here.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.844
A goonda like him will make things worse.
We are not needing him.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.263
-He might be exactly what we need.
-Okay.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.347
Find him.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.405
Everything had turned sour,

03:16.488 --> 03:18.782
Kavita, Karla.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.993
The old feeling of helplessness.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.205
I'd been here before,
my fate in other people's hands,

03:25.706 --> 03:26.874
and I hated it.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.007
Out all night, same dressâ€¦
That has to be a good sign.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.383
I want details.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.556
That good, huh?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.815
I think I found a way Lin can stay.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.817
Then why don't you look happier about it?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.861
It means I have to leave.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.989
I offered Kavita a story on Zhou,
the Palace,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.283
Walid and Sagar Wada. All of it.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.660
Or a version of it, anyway.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.580
Lin deserves to stay more than I do.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.749
One of us might as well get
what they want.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.795
Still wanna leave town? With me?

04:14.546 --> 04:16.130
Modena came here while you were gone.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.841
If you can get us new passports,
all three of us can go together.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.888
Would you speak to Kavita
about Zhou and the Palace?

04:22.971 --> 04:25.724
I might need it
to give her what I promised.

04:25.807 --> 04:30.062
If it hurts that crazy bitch
and helps you, then why not?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.483
As long as you promise we'll be gone
before the story comes out.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.609
We have to be.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.071
-Are you gonna tell Lin what you're doing?
-Nope.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.364
What about Khader?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.448
Him either.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.788
I can give them both what they want,
but only if they don't know.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.374
This is so you.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.877
You finally fall for a guy
and then you blow up the whole world,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.546
just so you can't be together.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.754
Lin, it's me.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.261
Come in.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.266
Let's hear it then, Didier.

05:49.349 --> 05:54.479
Yeah. The man looking for you
is a Nigerian named Raheem.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.691
He believes that
you swindled him somehow, uh,

05:57.774 --> 06:00.194
and, uh, wants you dead
and his money back.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.237
I haven't even fucking heard of the guy.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.824
He's been buying brown sugar
from Maurizio Belcane.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.826
Maurizio?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.871
-What, he set me up?
-Yeah.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.831
Dirty lying bastard.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.960
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.631
Maybe I could go and explain to him.
He'll see he's after the wrong man.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.884
If Raheem's been buying heroin in Khader's
territory, then I'll take care of it.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.678
-He's after me.
-And I'm saying I will fix it.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.432
If this Raheem wants me dead,
I'm gonna deal with it myself.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.518
We'll go after them together.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.103
I'm here as your brother first.
The results will be the same.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.318
-Good way to get yourself killed.
-Okay. Okay.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.028
You need to knock, mate.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.617
Okay. So, you do not want to know
where this very dangerous Raheem fellow,

06:48.700 --> 06:49.910
who is after Lin, is staying?

06:49.993 --> 06:51.203
Okay, I'll go.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.705
Prabhu, just tell us where he is.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.249
Tell us where he is.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.463
In a hotel near Colaba with two others.
Big, scary men, haan.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.092
All right, let's go.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.760
Wait-- Wait.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.764
-You've already done enough.
-Are you knowing anyone at this hotel?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.767
Raheem's room number even?

07:13.851 --> 07:17.104
No, na? My contacts will give us
the advantage of surprise.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.274
It's his funeral.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.317
Lin, a moment.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.362
Take this.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.367
I made a promise
I'd never use one of those again.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.963
Welcome to Bombay International Airport.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.592
Number two.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.679
Please show your passport and visas
to customs.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.435
Next in line.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.063
Purpose of trip?

08:01.023 --> 08:03.775
Uh, Detective Nightingale,
Australian Federal Police.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.737
I'm here on official business.
Shouldn't be here more than a week.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.990
Actually, one of your mob was, uh,
supposed to meet me here

08:10.073 --> 08:11.533
and spare me all this stuff.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.579
You've checked the box to indicate
you'll be here three to six months

08:15.662 --> 08:19.041
and stated purpose of trip
is tourism and not business.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.626
You need to fill out a new form.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.710
Uh, look, mate.

08:22.628 --> 08:25.964
-I'm a police officer, mate, like you.
-Mmm.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.763
No, no. Not here, sir.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.600
You need to fill out the form correctly,
get back into line and submit it again.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.976
Fuck this.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.102
Where's your skipper, eh?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.482
Sir, I am the supervising officer here.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.401
People are waiting,
and you're in their way.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.243
Excuse me.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.548
Lin, Abdullah, my friend Mohit.

09:07.631 --> 09:11.468
Um, I promised him
we'll be paying the tips he misses.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.971
It's okay.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.687
Hold.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.705
Okay. Ready.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.838
I only have one spare.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.512
Mate, you don't have to be here.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.517
Room service.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.980
We didn't order anything. Get out of here.

10:07.983 --> 10:13.030
Sir, I have message from Didier Levy.
Something about Lin Ford.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.538
Who the hell are you?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.358
Close the door, now!

10:54.613 --> 10:56.156
I heard you're looking for me.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.866
You are Lin Ford? You took my money!

10:57.950 --> 10:59.910
I know nothing about your money!

10:59.993 --> 11:03.247
Maurizio Belcane took my down payment
and never delivered.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.625
-Said you took the money.
-Yeah? Well, he's a fucking liar.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.753
Trust me when I tell you
that Lin had nothing to do with this.

11:10.796 --> 11:14.299
Because if he were selling heroin
in Colaba, I'd get the job of killing him.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.469
Do you recognize
the name Abdel Khader Khan?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.388
I'm his man.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.274
Let me leave with my life back to Nigeria,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.527
and I'll tell you
exactly where to find Maurizio.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.031
You can keep the money,
and you'll never see me again. My word.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.036
I need to know where Maurizio is.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.558
Maurizio, he lied to us.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.935
Lin Ford was not our problem.

12:07.019 --> 12:11.231
He is coming to you now, and you will
hand Maurizio over to him alive.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.695
But first make him tell you
where he put our money.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.990
I want him broken. Do you understand?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.200
Yes, boss.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.913
You're fucked, little man.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.376
He'll be waiting for you.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.798
Hey.

12:38.050 --> 12:41.261
I'll get my men to come here and deal
with them, then we can go get Maurizio.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.639
I don't need help dealing with
that lying piece of shit.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.683
He's tied to a chair.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.734
Lin! Come with me to Sagar Wada.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.028
This gundagiri is not you, Lin.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.073
Look, these men, this here,
I understand this. You had to come.

13:01.156 --> 13:04.618
But now, chasing Maurizio,
what use is this revenge?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.995
You are not dead. This is a good ending.
Let this be the end.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.122
You're not the one
he tried to have killed.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.835
Men like these,
don't leave them to do it again.

13:12.918 --> 13:16.421
You should listen to me,
not Abdullah or this voice in your head.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.133
Trust me, my friend.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.136
Come home with me.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.604
I should have listened,

13:32.688 --> 13:35.357
but years of anger had broken through,

13:36.191 --> 13:39.570
all the prison rage
I'd buried in a shallow grave.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.447
The sheer fury at being set up again.

13:43.907 --> 13:48.412
My life and death controlled
by another man's lies.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.519
It'll never end, dog.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.368
Oh, fuck's sake.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.413
Look at the state of you.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.835
Somebody told me you lost
a pint and a half of blood.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.755
You should see the other fella.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.550
You should've killed the other fella
when you had a bloody chance, mate.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.138
They're not gonna stop
coming for you now, Dale.

14:48.931 --> 14:49.932
Not ever.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.275
I don't know!

15:00.859 --> 15:02.069
Where's the money?

15:35.394 --> 15:38.355
No, you're fucked. You.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.706
Please show
your passport and visas to customs.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.466
Welcome to India, Mr. Nightingale.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.138
Detective Nightingale?

16:12.139 --> 16:14.808
I'm Chavan Sharma, your liaison officer
from Bombay Police. I will assist--

16:14.892 --> 16:18.979
Hey. Why didn't you help me
when that asshole was hassling me?

16:20.981 --> 16:25.152
Detective, do you enjoy it when
other people tell you how to do your job?

16:27.446 --> 16:30.199
Neither do I. I imagine neither does he.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.660
Well, as long as everyone's fucking happy.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.206
Please, I have a car waiting outside.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.583
I can take you to the police station,
and we can begin the formali--

16:39.666 --> 16:44.296
No. I want to talk to this Nishant Patel
fella at the Bombay National News first.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.757
Wasted enough time as it is. Thanks.

16:53.180 --> 16:57.017
Walid gave me as a bribe to Rujul
to secure the land rights to Sagar Wada.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.395
Madame Zhou told me,
whatever they asked, I had to do it.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.730
You had sex with Rujul?

17:02.231 --> 17:03.815
While Walid watched.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.568
I heard everything they talked about.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.906
And Rujul accepted the deal?

17:14.451 --> 17:17.954
No. Rujul told Walid
he couldn't be bought.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.957
But only after he'd had his fun.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.209
Walid was pissed off.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.127
That's why Rujul turned up dead.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.756
Madame Zhou knew what was going on?

17:28.507 --> 17:30.801
Nothing happens at the Palace
that she doesn't know about.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.136
And you're willing to go on the record
with all this?

17:35.681 --> 17:36.932
Sure.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.559
I'll give it all to you,

17:39.351 --> 17:42.145
as long as you promise not to publish
before I get out of town.

17:42.813 --> 17:47.150
So, Rujul's deputy, Akash Pandey,
gets his job.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.736
And according to the tapes,

17:49.820 --> 17:53.866
he does take Walid's money
and made the deal Rujul rejected?

17:54.491 --> 17:56.326
You heard it for yourself.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.703
Who's the girl in the pictures?

17:57.786 --> 18:00.664
Sunita, a prostitute from Kamathipura.

18:02.165 --> 18:06.461
Government corruption, hookers,
gangsters and a foreign-run brothel.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.964
What else do you need, Kavita?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.636
This blackmail material,
how did you come by it?

18:14.720 --> 18:16.263
I'm the one who arranged for it.

18:17.556 --> 18:20.517
Walid wanted some insurance
against Pandey changing his mind.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.729
If he doesn't get what he wants,
he'll expose Pandey.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.899
And now you're betraying Walid Shah?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.567
Yes.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.737
And I'm meant to believe
you're risking your life for Lin?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.447
Do you care why I'm doing it?

18:35.574 --> 18:38.785
I need your word. Do we have a deal?

18:45.542 --> 18:48.712
I'll need the girl to corroborate
that it's her voice on the tapes.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.672
-Can you bring her to me?
-Yes.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.635
All right.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.223
The Palace. Give me all of it.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.355
We should call the police.

20:39.031 --> 20:42.201
No one has called? No messages, nothing?

20:42.284 --> 20:43.660
No. Nothing for you.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.877
Hey, Lisa.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.175
-That looks sore. Ouch.
-It's nothing.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.432
What happened to your face?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.685
Busy day at the office.

21:50.727 --> 21:54.022
You know I have other things to do without
being summoned to drive you around?

21:54.106 --> 21:55.774
Then thank you for coming.

21:55.858 --> 22:00.320
Khaderbhai insisted. He's very concerned
about your happiness these days.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.739
Is that the money?

22:02.823 --> 22:03.824
Two lakhs.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.367
She earned it.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.411
A fortune for a Kamathipura whore.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.249
Why does it matter to you so much
what happens with this woman?

22:12.875 --> 22:14.710
Only a man would ask that.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.336
I made Sunita a promise.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.756
Sometimes all you've got left
is doing what you said you would do.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.301
What's going on with you, Karla?

22:23.427 --> 22:26.680
Sagar Wada will be ours.
Khader is pleased, and you will be rich.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.223
You should be happy.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.894
I will be, if you do a favor for me.

22:33.562 --> 22:36.857
I need passports and exit visas
for Lisa and Modena.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.735
The photos and everything are inside.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.196
Can you put them through
the book factory straightaway?

22:42.905 --> 22:44.948
-What's the rush?
-I didn't ask.

22:47.034 --> 22:50.078
Will you do it,
or should I ask Khader myself?

23:09.515 --> 23:13.519
What's so urgent you need to leave
four messages on my machine?

23:13.602 --> 23:15.562
I'm chasing a story. Some ch--

23:17.439 --> 23:21.068
What story would that be?
The one about my fugitive, maybe?

23:21.568 --> 23:22.903
Who are you?

23:24.613 --> 23:27.699
Detective Walter Nightingale,
Australian Federal Police.

23:27.783 --> 23:30.494
Come here to take bright boy back home.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.996
Chavan here is facilitating the process.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.749
What's he wanted for?

23:35.832 --> 23:39.878
Dale Conti is wanted for armed robbery
and escaping prison.

23:41.713 --> 23:42.923
He's gone.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.094
What? He's gone? He's gone where?

23:47.177 --> 23:51.306
I don't know. He caught wind of my story
and he ran, I think.

23:51.890 --> 23:55.310
You better be bloody joking.
What kind of journalist are you?

23:56.395 --> 24:01.608
I don't know. Maybe similar to the kind
of policeman who lets prisoners escape?

24:03.819 --> 24:06.196
You think you're clever, sweetheart? Hmm?

24:06.280 --> 24:09.324
I'm here on official Australian business.
I don't have to sit here and listen--

24:09.408 --> 24:12.911
But I am not an Australian,
and this is not Australia.

24:15.289 --> 24:18.834
Does this gora have any jurisdiction
to harass well-connected Indian citizens?

24:19.626 --> 24:22.254
Or is this a police action
against a free Bombay press?

24:22.337 --> 24:25.215
Because maybe that is also a story?

24:26.049 --> 24:29.052
I also see you did not bring
a female officer with you.

24:29.595 --> 24:33.307
Are you unaware of the rules
of your own department, sir?

24:33.932 --> 24:36.935
-Detective Nightingale, we need to leave.
-Wait, she knows more than she's saying.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.103
We need to go.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.198
She's fucking lying.

24:49.948 --> 24:53.327
What were you thinking,
sending that fax without telling me?

24:53.952 --> 24:55.579
You should be thanking me.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.458
Your angel of the slums is a bank robber
and a prison escapee.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.710
This is a great story. You were right.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.545
I just hope
you haven't messed everything up.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.631
I'm very confused.

25:06.507 --> 25:08.342
I've got a better story.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.886
Better than this one that,
until yesterday, you were all over,

25:10.969 --> 25:13.388
but also ready to give up
until I brought it back to you?

25:13.472 --> 25:17.768
Yes, much better. But I need Lin Ford
safe and sound to make it happen.

25:18.644 --> 25:19.728
I traded up.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.522
What are you talking about?

25:21.605 --> 25:25.192
Foreign prostitutes, murder,
government corruption

25:25.275 --> 25:29.488
and a massive land fraud
engineered by Walid Shah.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.033
I have sources, photographs
and audiotapes.

25:33.116 --> 25:37.120
But if you want it,
we can't run the Lin story.

25:40.666 --> 25:41.667
Karla?

25:43.669 --> 25:44.920
Karla, you home?

25:50.008 --> 25:51.093
Lin.

25:52.803 --> 25:54.054
Even better.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.267
I was hoping Karla would know
where you were.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.893
Why are you looking for me?

26:00.561 --> 26:02.729
Yeah, well, something came up.

26:02.813 --> 26:07.359
You know, like Maurizio ripping off some
Nigerian gangsters and blaming it on me.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.794
Now, I'm guessing that Modena's involved.

26:28.005 --> 26:30.132
And if he is, that means you are too.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.218
-I don't know anything, Lin--
-Don'tâ€¦

26:34.970 --> 26:36.096
lie.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.933
I'm not in the mood, Lisa.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.228
You should start talking.

26:44.855 --> 26:45.981
Okay, you're right.

26:50.235 --> 26:54.615
Maurizio ripped off Raheem and then
Modena stole the money from Maurizio.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.491
I didn't know about it, thenâ€¦

26:57.784 --> 27:00.287
Maurizio went crazy,
came and took our passports.

27:02.039 --> 27:03.540
He wants his money back.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.377
I swear to you, that's all I know, Lin.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.755
If I knew Maurizio had--

27:10.255 --> 27:14.468
I would have told you, Lin.
I swear, I would.

27:15.302 --> 27:17.971
-Would you? You'd have told me?
-Mmm.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.943
Look, Lisa, this is your lucky day.

27:33.487 --> 27:34.947
I want Maurizio.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.700
-Um--
-So, you're gonna help me,

27:39.201 --> 27:40.994
and I'm gonna get your passports back.

27:41.078 --> 27:43.372
And you're not gonna have to worry
about him again.

27:43.455 --> 27:45.457
No, I'm not getting involved, Lin.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.293
We can get new passports--

27:49.586 --> 27:51.004
Not today, you can't.

27:51.839 --> 27:55.384
This is the first place
I came asking about you.

27:56.593 --> 27:59.346
How long do you think
until Maurizio walks through that door?

28:01.306 --> 28:02.933
Then what are you gonna do?

28:03.684 --> 28:05.310
This is your shit, Lisa.

28:06.311 --> 28:09.147
I'll clean it up for you,
but you gotta play your part.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.777
Are you okay with this?

28:14.570 --> 28:15.737
She's fine with it.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.785
Lin, I will get your passport tomorrow.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.955
Maurizio has bigger things to worry about
than you.

28:25.038 --> 28:29.168
And the rest of it, Lisa and Modena's
situation, this is not your business.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.253
-Let it go.
-I can't.

28:31.336 --> 28:32.588
Why not?

28:33.172 --> 28:37.092
'Cause this time, I'm gonna look
the bastard who set me up in the face.

28:37.176 --> 28:40.387
If nothing else, before I leave Bombay,
at least I'm gonna get that.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.348
I don't understand. This time?

28:44.099 --> 28:45.309
You don't need to.

28:46.727 --> 28:51.815
Lin, I owe you, but this is not the way
I wanted to pay you back.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.737
Are you gonna make the call or not?

28:59.198 --> 29:02.701
I'll make the call.
Maurizio will get Lisa's message.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.786
Thank you.

29:17.674 --> 29:18.926
Is this your blood?

29:20.093 --> 29:21.094
Some of it.

29:22.679 --> 29:27.893
Where are my drugs?
Or the money you owe for them?

29:29.645 --> 29:30.854
I don't have them.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.608
Modena stole the cash from me.

29:35.526 --> 29:39.238
Raheem nearly killed me, I barely escaped,
had to kill one of his menâ€¦

29:41.740 --> 29:43.909
and now I need to find Modena.
He has our money.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.422
What's to stop you running?

29:57.506 --> 29:58.966
Running? Running with what?

30:00.259 --> 30:03.095
I've got nothing
but the clothes I'm standing in here.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.429
I need that money.

30:04.513 --> 30:05.848
Karla's here.

30:17.651 --> 30:20.737
If I'm not out in 30 minutes,
come and find me.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.494
What the fuck is she doing here with him?

30:28.620 --> 30:30.205
Their master's business.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.503
You're telling me
Karla works for Khader Khan?

30:41.341 --> 30:43.844
Oh, the fucking bitch.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.430
What are you talking about?

30:47.222 --> 30:49.808
Oh, no. No, nothing.
It, uh, doesn't matter.

30:50.809 --> 30:54.980
Pandey was never
going to leave his family for you.

30:55.814 --> 30:58.525
But that didn't give him
the right to abandon you.

30:59.860 --> 31:04.072
It was my mistake,
hoping something good would happen to me.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.618
Who did I think I was?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.163
I was so stupid.

31:12.706 --> 31:17.002
Sunita, you need to know your own worth.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.378
Understand me?

31:19.171 --> 31:21.965
Pandey is a coward and a liar.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.635
Why do you want to stay with him?

31:25.219 --> 31:26.845
Why do you care?

31:27.513 --> 31:29.264
You have what you want.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.601
I made you a promise.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.645
I made you a promise.

31:36.188 --> 31:38.607
Then I can leave this place?

31:38.690 --> 31:41.193
I'm here to take you out.

31:42.027 --> 31:43.946
You can go wherever you want.

31:44.571 --> 31:47.199
If you like, go back to Kamathipura.

31:48.784 --> 31:49.868
Orâ€¦

31:50.536 --> 31:55.791
I can give you enough money
to begin a new life, somewhere else.

32:01.213 --> 32:02.714
What is the price?

32:03.549 --> 32:07.386
I want you to talk to a friend of mine,
a reporter,

32:08.011 --> 32:10.430
about all that has happened,

32:10.514 --> 32:16.103
about how Pandey has used you
and abandoned you.

32:16.186 --> 32:17.437
Everything.

32:17.521 --> 32:20.274
This would be very bad for him.

32:20.357 --> 32:24.194
We'd see who matters after all for sure.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.122
How much?

32:40.252 --> 32:41.253
Two lakhs.

32:43.505 --> 32:48.886
But you have to leave Bombay forever
and never come back.

33:01.607 --> 33:04.067
Our business is concluded, it seems.

33:05.444 --> 33:09.239
Show our Sunita to her car.
I'd like to talk with Karla alone.

33:10.240 --> 33:14.244
No harm will come to her.
You have my word.

33:20.959 --> 33:24.796
As I had Khader's word
no harm would come to me if I did this.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.924
You're standing here alive and well.

33:27.007 --> 33:29.676
Keep our business to yourself,
and there's no reason for that to change.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.013
Likewise.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.473
Is that a threat?

33:34.556 --> 33:36.475
No. No.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.895
The opposite.

33:40.979 --> 33:46.568
A plea not to forget how delicate
a situation we all find ourselves in.

33:50.155 --> 33:53.116
We're bound by our secrets now, Karla.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.193
They will be followed?

34:28.277 --> 34:29.277
Yes.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.879
Hello?

34:46.962 --> 34:48.463
I got your message from Didier.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.466
I've told Modena to give you the money.

34:51.550 --> 34:54.428
All we want is 20 grand
and our passports back.

34:54.511 --> 34:55.971
I can live with that.

34:57.014 --> 34:59.016
You just have to promise not to hurt us.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.768
Just take the money and we're done.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.687
I didn't start all of this, Lisa.

35:04.813 --> 35:08.442
He did.
I just want to put it right for all of us.

35:11.987 --> 35:14.072
Come to Modena's apartment at 10:00 p.m.

35:18.202 --> 35:19.453
He'll be there.

35:20.078 --> 35:21.371
You're coming with me.

35:22.456 --> 35:24.041
Please don't make me do this.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.709
He needs to think everything's okay.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.462
If you aren't there,
he's gonna know something's up.

35:28.545 --> 35:29.880
Why is this so important to you?

35:31.048 --> 35:34.343
Why don't you just go back
to playing doctor in the fucking slum?

35:35.010 --> 35:38.931
I'm sorry, Lisa. But I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

35:39.515 --> 35:41.183
So, what? You're gonna kill him?

35:43.227 --> 35:45.020
I'm gonna make him know how it feels.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.915
What is this place?

36:04.998 --> 36:08.794
Somewhere safe I arranged for Sunita.
They're going to help her get out of town.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.838
-Who?
-Just a friend.

36:10.921 --> 36:12.422
I'll make my own way home.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.992
Kavita, this is Sunita.

36:42.619 --> 36:43.620
Come in.

36:52.963 --> 36:54.298
You have no jurisdiction here,

36:54.381 --> 36:57.426
so everything you do must first
be sanctioned by my superiors,

36:57.509 --> 36:59.970
then done in cooperation with myself
or a designated officer.

37:00.053 --> 37:02.306
Yeah, but you've sanctioned
my request to check in the hotels?

37:02.389 --> 37:03.724
That would take a lot of time.

37:03.807 --> 37:05.767
But it's happening?
Now, what about that girl?

37:05.851 --> 37:07.644
Can we have another crack at her
from the newspaper?

37:07.728 --> 37:09.438
We can't force her to tell us anything.

37:09.521 --> 37:12.065
She's harboring a fugitive
from the law, mate. Come on.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.442
You have no proof of this.

37:13.525 --> 37:15.235
And that newspaper,
they love to make trouble.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.116
This office is for you.

37:28.248 --> 37:29.374
Great.

37:31.627 --> 37:32.878
Fuck, it's hot.

37:33.879 --> 37:36.089
Is there anything I can retrieve for you?

37:36.173 --> 37:38.967
Any chai or food?
You have not eaten since the airport.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.261
Samosa? Naan? Veg frankie?

37:41.887 --> 37:44.223
No, I don't want
any of that spicy shit you eat.

37:45.307 --> 37:46.850
Just get me some hard-boiled eggs.

37:46.934 --> 37:48.101
As you wish.

38:08.539 --> 38:09.665
Lisa?

38:14.044 --> 38:15.170
Lisa?

38:21.635 --> 38:22.761
Lisa?

38:59.715 --> 39:01.550
Any tricks, and you get the first one.

39:02.509 --> 39:06.471
Sebastian? I have a gun on her.

39:06.555 --> 39:08.223
It's true. He has a gun.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.268
Move back inside and put on the light.

39:12.227 --> 39:13.353
Now.

39:24.198 --> 39:27.743
No! Lin, wait! Wait, the money.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.870
The money.
She knows where the money is. Wait.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.872
I don't care about the fucking money!

39:33.790 --> 39:34.791
You set me up.

39:34.875 --> 39:35.876
No. No, no, no.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.379
Is this what you wanted for me? Huh?

39:39.463 --> 39:41.381
-No. No!
-Is this what you wanted for me?

39:41.465 --> 39:43.967
-How does it feel? How does it feel?
-I'm sorry, Lin.

39:44.051 --> 39:46.595
Knowing you're gonna fucking die,
and there's nothing you can do about it?

39:46.678 --> 39:47.721
I thought it was you!

39:47.804 --> 39:49.890
I thought it was you,
that you gave me up to Taheri.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.142
-I thought you tried to get me killed!
-Bullshit!

39:52.226 --> 39:55.187
-I didn't know it was Karla.
-Shut up, Maurizio!

39:58.398 --> 39:59.816
-What are you saying?
-Lin.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.360
Shut the fuck up!

40:03.487 --> 40:04.863
Say that again.

40:04.947 --> 40:09.284
Okay, I fucked up. Don't kill me. Okay?

40:09.368 --> 40:12.371
I didn't know Karla worked for Khaderbhai.
Okay?

40:12.454 --> 40:15.958
I thought you told Abdullah,
that you set me up.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.335
But it was her. It was her.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.504
These bitches--
These bitches, they set me up.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.673
Please. Please.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.420
What's this?

41:01.503 --> 41:03.964
Hard-boiled eggs and hotel records,
as requested.

41:07.301 --> 41:09.928
You expect me
to go through these all myself?

41:10.012 --> 41:12.556
This way, you can be sure we did not miss

41:12.639 --> 41:15.642
anything a trained detective
such as yourself would not.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.479
Are they in English? Chavan?

41:26.195 --> 41:27.738
Where the hell have you been?

41:29.448 --> 41:30.532
What's going on?

41:38.874 --> 41:40.417
You had them all along?

41:41.335 --> 41:42.794
You bastard.

41:42.878 --> 41:44.630
Yeah, I guess we're all fucking liars.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.590
Is someone going to tell me
what's going on?

41:46.673 --> 41:47.674
-Don't.
-He just--

41:53.013 --> 41:54.181
What is this?

42:06.151 --> 42:07.402
Lin, tell me.

42:13.325 --> 42:15.869
Do you remember saying someone told youâ€¦

42:18.121 --> 42:21.375
all the questions
and most of the answers in life

42:21.458 --> 42:22.960
can be found in Shakespeare?

42:26.338 --> 42:28.632
It was the night I introduced you
to Khader Khan.

42:37.975 --> 42:39.309
You lied to me that night,

42:40.477 --> 42:42.855
and you've been lying to me ever since.

42:43.438 --> 42:45.148
Was it a setup from the start?

42:47.568 --> 42:51.488
Using me to get Rujul, Sagar Wada
and all of it.

42:52.281 --> 42:54.575
You two yanking me around on a string?

42:56.201 --> 43:01.039
Was that your job? To keep me interested,
to make me care?

43:02.541 --> 43:06.336
To make sure I stayed where I was
meant to be to do his fucking bullshit?

43:11.925 --> 43:15.304
What about when you took care of me
when I was sick?

43:16.972 --> 43:20.851
Was that the same shit?
Just to lead me on?

43:25.063 --> 43:27.900
-Even now you've got nothing to say?
-What can I say that'll make a--

43:27.983 --> 43:30.360
I want you to tell me
that I'm fucking wrong.

43:32.613 --> 43:37.618
I told you everythingâ€¦
and you told me nothing.

43:40.829 --> 43:42.998
Did you ever have
any real feelings for me at all?

43:43.081 --> 43:44.082
Yes.

43:46.043 --> 43:47.544
But you lied to me anyway?

43:47.628 --> 43:48.629
Yeah.

43:51.465 --> 43:52.799
Guess I should say thank you.

43:56.345 --> 43:59.181
For the first time,
I'm actually glad I'm fucking leaving.

43:59.264 --> 44:01.725
-You don't have to go.
-What?

44:01.808 --> 44:03.519
You don't have to go anymore.

44:04.186 --> 44:06.522
Everything you said is true.

44:08.023 --> 44:10.651
But, please, listen to me.
If there's one thing I can do, I can--

44:10.734 --> 44:13.278
I don't want a thing from you.

44:16.156 --> 44:17.991
I never wanna see you again.
