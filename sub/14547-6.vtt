00:01.042 --> 00:03.253
(Tessa)
The town of Chatswin
had an undertow

00:03.294 --> 00:05.422
and it was always looking
for ways

00:05.463 --> 00:07.132
to suck you back in.

00:07.173 --> 00:10.552
- Bellini-Beluga block party?
- Trash.

00:10.593 --> 00:14.389
Extension convention,
10% off human clip-ons.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.807
What is a human clip-on?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.559
Doesn't matter.
We're not interested.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.020
Should we sponsor Chatswin
Elementary's twerkathon?

00:20.061 --> 00:21.980
They're twerking to end
gun violence.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.108
Um, I, I feel like
that's not gonna work.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.153
Hey, we're invited to tour
Chatswin's historic homes.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.864
'Hmm, do I want to see
some rich lady'

00:30.905 --> 00:33.158
show off her walk-in bra closet?

00:36.828 --> 00:40.123
You know what, kind of,
but gonna have to decline.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.000
George and I were doing
an excellent job

00:42.042 --> 00:43.960
of keeping to ourselves,
but it was easy

00:44.002 --> 00:46.129
to turn down invitations
that came in the mail.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.089
The ones that were delivered
face-to-face

00:48.131 --> 00:49.883
were a little more challenging.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.593
Well, do I look any different?

00:51.634 --> 00:54.345
Turning 17 tomorrow,
y'all, 1-7.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.639
It's, like, the last prime
number before you can vote.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.099
It's kind of a big deal.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.893
You did it, man,
y-you made it.

00:59.934 --> 01:04.064
And in celebration,
I intend to make it nasty.

01:04.105 --> 01:08.193
I am dropping it on hos.
I am dropping it on the ho.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.112
What does that mean?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.739
It means, I'm having
a small dinner party

01:12.781 --> 01:15.450
at Shabu-Shabbos,
the kosher Japanese restaurant.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.368
Parentals said
I can invite three friends

01:17.410 --> 01:20.121
so without any further ado.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.123
Oh, thanks. I can't wait.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.713
They throw vegetables in the air

01:28.755 --> 01:30.215
and catch them
in their chef's hat.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.717
It's a meal and a show.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.803
Hope you guys have fun.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.847
Oh, come on, Tessa,
a guy only turns 17 once.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.266
That is, until they make
time travel a reality.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.102
[laughing]

01:47.357 --> 01:49.317
C-come on now,
my arm's getting tired.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.197
Alright, you know,
I'm-I'm just gonna

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
set the invitation down here

01:55.573 --> 01:57.617
and, uh, y-you can just
mull it over.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.328
You know,
just give it a good mull.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.038
Yes, I will do that.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.084
Great, and if you could let me
know ASAP, that would dope.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.378
Because I can only invite
three people.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.420
Got it.

02:09.462 --> 02:10.463
So if you're not coming

02:10.505 --> 02:11.881
I'd like to invite someone else.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.508
In that case, I-I think

02:13.550 --> 02:16.511
you should probably
invite someone else.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.304
Okay, you called my bluff.
There's no one else.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.848
Ooh, but the thing is

02:19.889 --> 02:21.432
there's also
an important calculus test

02:21.474 --> 02:23.101
that I need to study for.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.185
(Evan)
'Okay, well, just, you know'

02:24.227 --> 02:25.603
think about it and let me know.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.107
I did, and I did,
and I'm not coming.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.901
I'll circle back.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.156
Yeah, that's good, that's good.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.991
We'll..

02:38.032 --> 02:39.534
[sighs]

02:39.576 --> 02:40.702
That was painful.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.036
W-why you got to be
such a hater?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.830
Hey, you can call me
a lot of things

02:43.872 --> 02:47.167
but it is a well-known fact
that I am not a hater.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.711
Sure, the last name Smith
gets her in the door

02:49.752 --> 02:53.173
but that young lady whips
her own hair back and forth.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.091
No one does that for her.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.801
Just because I don't wanna
go to Evan's party

02:56.843 --> 02:58.845
doesn't make me a hater.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.098
Parties are optional, right?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.892
Damn it, I think
she got us on that one.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.894
Parties are optional.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.104

Okay.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.577
- Here you go.
- You're a peach.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.214
[sighs]

03:34.255 --> 03:36.174
Okay, I didn't really need
to borrow a cup of milk.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.220
Although that was refreshing.
I needed a cup of you.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.805
'Cause I never see you anymore,
not since you quit us.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.934
I didn't quit you.
I just, I quit the country club.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.352
Was it because of
when our leg hairs brushed

03:47.393 --> 03:48.603
against each other
in the steam room?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.688
Because I assure you
that was accidental

03:50.730 --> 03:52.607
and completely forgotten.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.817
It's not like your wind song
stays on my mind.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.569
Look, Fred,
it's nothing personal.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.656
I just decided I'm not
a country club kind of guy.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.618
- So you hate me.
- Not at all.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.205
I just didn't like who I was
turning into at that club.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.831
Because you were
turning into me?

04:08.873 --> 04:11.251
Hey, what if you and I found
a new place to hang out?

04:11.292 --> 04:12.710
Somewhere without a dress code

04:12.752 --> 04:15.630
where we can both relax
and be ourselves.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.257
I have the perfect place.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.425
Right here.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.718
Che Che, Jorge.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.136
'Hey, after I get
my loads folded'

04:22.178 --> 04:24.138
we can fire up some classic
episodes of "Ellen"

04:24.180 --> 04:26.391
and dance
to an imaginary audience.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.894
Right, well, I was, I was
thinking maybe somewhere

04:29.936 --> 04:33.773
outside of your home
where we can get a drink and..

04:33.815 --> 04:35.275
...also maybe not smell
whatever it is

04:35.316 --> 04:36.901
that's coming out
of your kitchen right now.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.238
Come on, Fred, there's got
to be a good bar around.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.198
You know, as a matter of fact,
a new bar just opened.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.616
That's what I'm talking about!

04:43.658 --> 04:45.118
Some dive where a couple of guys

04:45.159 --> 04:47.578
can go out
and get a nice stiff drink.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.289
Yeah, I even got a coupon.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.165
Nothing says dive bar
like a good coupon.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.750
Am I right?

04:57.380 --> 05:00.091
Wait.
What is this, a juice bar?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.634
It's got everything we need.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.177
Ample natural light.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.763
Clean, sturdy stools.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.682
We can bro-down
till the cows come home

05:07.724 --> 05:09.392
by which I mean Sheila.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.146
By which I mean, she has
big and tender brown eyes.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.856
Just please don't tell Sheila
I called her a cow.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.483
Fred, when I said drink,
I wasn't talking about juice.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.571
But this is pressed juice
loaded with fibrous nutrients.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.866
It's more than a beverage.
It's a movement.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.909
Right now there's only
one oppressed nation

05:26.951 --> 05:29.412
but their dream is to have
oppressed nations

05:29.454 --> 05:31.122
all over the world.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.458
Well, we can all dream.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.252
- Two fermented Fujis, please.
- Alright.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.129
They contain a trace amount
of alcohol

05:38.171 --> 05:40.214
but I'm wearing
my medic-alert bracelet

05:40.256 --> 05:41.632
so let's party.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.884
Are you a member
of our juice club?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.927
Uh, no, no, I am not a regular.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.929
You might be after you try this.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.355
Hmm, what if I told you
that contained nothing

05:55.396 --> 05:56.939
but kabocha squash
and almond milk?

05:56.981 --> 05:58.566
I'd tell you to shut your mouth.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.152
- There's no ice cream in that?
- No.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.488
- I, I will take a large.
- Sorry.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.281
Non-members can only sample
the specialty flavors.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.742
- I'm a member.
- C-can I sip on his?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.619
- No, I won't let you.
- Ah.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.205
If you sign up
for the juice club

06:12.246 --> 06:13.790
you get to order off
the insider's menu.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.792
- And you get deep discounts.
- You know what?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.960
This might be
the kabocha squash talking.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.173
But I'm in.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.013
Oh, hey, Tessa. Great news.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.849
I got to our math teacher,
Mrs. Nelson.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.518
What do, what do you mean
you got to her?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
Well, I told her
that some students

06:34.936 --> 06:36.604
including yours truly,
were suffering

06:36.646 --> 06:38.689
from pre-traumatic
test disorder

06:38.731 --> 06:40.233
and she agreed
to postpone the exam.

06:40.274 --> 06:44.153
Oh, that's great.
So what?

06:44.195 --> 06:46.948
So the excuse you gave
is no longer valid.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.991
Crisis averted?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.952
Set Tessa to party mode?

06:50.993 --> 06:52.954
Commence cookies and cream?

06:52.995 --> 06:56.290
Okay, well the truth is

06:56.332 --> 06:58.459
the test wasn't the only reason
I couldn't go to your party.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.211
See, I made this pact
with my dad.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.589
I'm not trying to take
your virginity, Tessa.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.217
- Not that kind of pact.
- So I can take your virginity?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.803
That is not
what this is about, right?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.847
You're not trying to ask me
on a double date

07:10.888 --> 07:13.182
because I know how
indiscriminately horny you are.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.225
Filthy as charged.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.394
And I just wanna make sure

07:16.436 --> 07:18.146
that is not what this is about.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.273
No, of course not,
unless you want it to be

07:20.314 --> 07:21.899
in which case, yes,
it absolutely is.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.694
- I don't want it to be.
- Then, yeah, no probs.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.113
See you at 5:15
and, uh, no gifts.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.700
Just write down 17 reasons
why you're glad I was born.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.202
Oh, and I'm not saying
it has to be in pirate speak

07:33.244 --> 07:35.204
but the theme is pirates.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.384
(Dalia)
Welcome to Crystal Cup
of Crystals.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.512
How can I provide you
with dazzling service today?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.222
Oh, I'm, uh,
just looking around, thanks.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.807
For anything in particular?

07:54.849 --> 07:57.643
We just got in a stunning
shipment of figurines

07:57.685 --> 07:59.896
based on
the "Modern Family" gang.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.899
Crystal Cam's my fave 'cause
there's nothing he won't say.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.109
Actually, I was just wondering
if you had a bathroom.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.611
Let me guess, you just came

08:06.652 --> 08:08.321
from the new juice place
down the street.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.240
- Yeah. So the bathroom?
- Tell me something.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.743
What are they putting
in those juices over there?

08:13.784 --> 08:14.911
Look, I don't know,
but all I know is

08:14.952 --> 08:17.330
it doesn't stay very long.

08:17.371 --> 08:21.000
- I'm begging you.
- Bathroom's in the back.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.379
And wipe down the crystal sink
when you're done.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.256
It spots easy.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.053
Ho, ho, ho.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.513
Ahoy, me hearty.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.806
Shiver me timbers.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.558
Happy Birthday, Evan.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.393
You wenches clean up nicely.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.980
Lucky is the pirate
that finds booty tonight.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.816
Hi, can I start you guys off
with an Adam Sandler roll?

08:45.858 --> 08:49.278
- Is it any good?
- It's super popular, but no.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.697
Hey, it's my 17th birthday.
Can I get a hug?

08:52.865 --> 08:55.243
Sure, cutie.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.911
(Evan)
'Oh, my God, you smell so good.'

08:56.953 --> 08:59.914
I, I think you're smelling
sukiyaki sauce.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
Boy-yoi-yoing.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.128
Okay, let's toast the man
of the hour, yours truly, me.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.967
Evan Fievel Abramowitz.

09:11.008 --> 09:14.512
E is for everything I like
about him, which is many.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.015
V is for very much,
which is plenty.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.686
A is for his asthma,
which never slows him down.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.729
N is, is not really

09:23.771 --> 09:25.690
'cause it-it really
slows him down.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.401
- Just..
- Hey, I love you, bro.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.741
Welcome to Crystal Cup
of Crystals.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.368
How can I provide you with daz--

09:37.410 --> 09:38.619
You got a bathroom?

09:38.661 --> 09:42.415
Well, of course we do.
However..

09:42.456 --> 09:44.417
So if you'd like to
empty your bladder

09:44.458 --> 09:47.003
you will also need
to empty your wallet.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.841
Fine.
I'll take one of these.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.510
A single crystal tear?
That's how you're gonna do me?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.263
I am a strong,
independent businesswoman

09:57.305 --> 09:59.557
not a bathroom attendant.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.855
I didn't name this establishment
Crystal Crap of Crappers.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.733
I swear, there is not enough
autumn pear in the world.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.610
I am putting that
juice place on notice.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.445
On notice.

10:15.823 --> 10:19.285
And number 17,
on my Evan loving list

10:19.327 --> 10:22.705
is the way his teeth gleam
like precious amethyst.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.126
I don't know, Tessa,
those were some

10:27.168 --> 10:28.252
pretty tough acts to follow.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.587
Oh.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.381
My gift is less of a epic poem

10:32.423 --> 10:35.801
and more of a online gift card.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.429
Wow, okay,
that's hurtfully impersonal.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.264
Yes, but on the bright side

10:40.306 --> 10:42.975
you can buy anything you want
online these days.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.771
Yeah, except friends.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.523
You know, I, I think I feel my
bronchial passages tightening.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.609
I, I'm gonna get some fresh air.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.361
Really, you couldn't just
freestyle something?

10:53.402 --> 10:56.322
- Off the dome?
- Guys, no.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.325
Because no.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.202
Even if I could drop something
off the dome

11:01.243 --> 11:03.829
trust me, you guys wouldn't
like what I had to say.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.165
I didn't even wanna come here
in the first place.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.875
So, what, so you think
you're just too cool for Evan

11:07.917 --> 11:09.335
'cause he's a nerd?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.754
Have we not progressed
beyond nerd bigotry

11:11.796 --> 11:13.422
as a society on the whole?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.757
Or did you not vote for Pedro?

11:14.799 --> 11:15.925
It is not that.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.218
McLovin, screech powers.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.386
Poindexter on the violin.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.679
I ask,
was all their work in vain?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.390
Did Steve Urkel
do that for nothing?

11:22.431 --> 11:26.102
I swear, when you get emphatic,
it is unspeakably arousing.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.520
You want to take care
of that situation?

11:27.561 --> 11:28.896
But look, you guys

11:28.938 --> 11:31.190
I don't hate Evan
because he's a nerd

11:31.232 --> 11:33.693
but I don't give him a free pass
because of it either.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.986
Sorry, I just,
I, I don't subscribe

11:36.028 --> 11:39.407
to that whole
protected class thing.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.743
It's like, who is the biggest
two-faced klepto we know, who?

11:42.785 --> 11:44.912
- I don't know.
- You don't wanna say it.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.539
I know, 'cause it's Katie.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.917
Katie, who, uh, happens
to be in a wheelchair.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.129
Oh, my gosh, I love your purse.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.506
Thanks.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.634
Hey, guys, look at this
ugly purse I just found.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.392
- Katie has been through a lot.
- Agreed.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.270
But does that mean she gets
to do whatever she wants?

12:09.311 --> 12:12.898
Does that mean because Evan
has adorkable, little glasses

12:12.940 --> 12:15.234
and an ever-present canister
of albuterol

12:15.276 --> 12:17.987
that he gets to postpone tests

12:18.028 --> 12:19.864
and grope the waitstaff?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
Look, if you don't have
anything nice to say--

12:21.115 --> 12:22.658
Don't say it at all, correct.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.411
Which is why I declined
Bellinis and Belugas.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.954
I declined twerkathons

12:26.996 --> 12:29.498
and I tried to decline
attending the birthday

12:29.540 --> 12:33.419
of a self-indulgent,
horny manipulator--

12:33.461 --> 12:36.172
♪ Happy Birthday to ye ♪

12:36.213 --> 12:38.591
♪ Happy Birthday to.. ♪

12:40.426 --> 12:42.428
Well, I can tell you
who's not getting

12:42.470 --> 12:44.597
the marzipan parrot.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.731
Oh, hello.
Do you like delicious things?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.151
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.946
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah, I'm drunk, on nutrition.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.531
[chuckles]
Try this new juice I found.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.451
- It's got goji pulp.
- I don't want goji pulp.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.209
What happened
to our everything else?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.377
I got rid of it
to make room for the juice.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.670
It's cheaper if you buy in bulk

13:16.712 --> 13:18.422
and with my
new membership discount--

13:18.464 --> 13:21.842
What? You joined a club?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.427
I thought we weren't doing that.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.263
No, it's not a club, club.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.474
It's-it's just an opportunity
for people

13:28.516 --> 13:29.975
who live in certain zip codes

13:30.017 --> 13:32.603
to get privileges
that aren't available..

13:32.645 --> 13:35.856
Crap, I joined a club.
I wasn't supposed to do that.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.942
- No.
- How did this happen?

13:37.983 --> 13:39.944
You sipped the juice.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.072
George, you let your guard down
and you sipped the juice.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.448
That's how it works.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.117
You show just a little
bit of weakness

13:47.159 --> 13:49.286
and, and the next thing
you know, you're in

13:49.328 --> 13:52.957
full pirate garb,
ruining birthdays

13:52.998 --> 13:58.003
and jeopardizing
your two best friendships.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.630
Now if you will excuse me,
I'm gonna pour myself

13:59.672 --> 14:01.924
a big bowl of cereal
because, as you can see

14:01.966 --> 14:04.009
I did not
get the marzipan parrot.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.477
I can't even look at you
right now.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.479
There's gum in my car.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.612
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.614
Victor's at school.
I got my chores done.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.200
Do you want to binge-watch
some "Silk Stalkings?"

14:28.242 --> 14:31.579
Uh, sorry, Fred. I'm spending
the day in the city.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.206
I got a little off-track
and I need a dose

14:34.248 --> 14:35.958
of New York
to remind me who I am.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.335
Don't have to ask me once,
I am in.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.170
I-I don't think you're ready

14:40.212 --> 14:41.755
for the mean streets
of Manhattan.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.759
Nonsense, if "Crocodile Dundee"
can acclimate..

14:45.801 --> 14:48.512
O-okay, but we're not gonna
be doing any touristy stuff.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.097
- Nor would I want to.
- Okay.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.057
Let me just grab my poncho,
my traveler's checks

14:52.099 --> 14:53.726
and my walking stick.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.144
I'll be right back.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.481
[indistinct chatter]

15:00.900 --> 15:02.818
Uh, can I sit here

15:02.860 --> 15:05.321
or are you guys
saving this seat for Evan?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.740
- She doesn't know.
- She wouldn't care.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.116
- She might.
- She won't.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.869
Hey, she's standing right here.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.871
You wanna tell her
what you're talking about?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.710
Evan was too upset
to come to school today.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.588
Evan actually skipped school?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.174
I thought he had the record
for perfect attendance.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.386
Not anymore, that crown is now
worn by Vikram Deshpande.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.765
(all)
Go, Vikram, go, Vikram.
Go, Vikram, go, Vikram!

15:32.806 --> 15:35.976
Don't get cocky, Vikram.
Flu season's are coming.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.771
I wasn't trying to ruin
his perfect attendance record

15:38.812 --> 15:42.358
and I certainly wasn't trying
to ruin his birthday.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.444
But I guess I did both.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.448
But in my defense,
you guys have seen my iPod.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.866
You like Willow Smith.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.660
That doesn't make you
a good person.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.662
And that's when I realized

15:54.703 --> 15:58.540
trying so hard not to change
changes you.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.959
And as for George..

16:00.000 --> 16:01.543
Okay, when it's crowded
like this

16:01.585 --> 16:03.045
you're gonna wanna
grab onto the poll

16:03.087 --> 16:06.006
unless it's just unpleasantly
sticky, which it is.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.925
You know what,
just grab onto me.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.302
He couldn't tell
if the city had changed..

16:10.344 --> 16:11.804
Oh. There you go.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.056
[coughing]

16:14.098 --> 16:15.891
...or he had.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.894
You are gonna love this place.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.688
They have the thickest steaks
in town.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.189
Hey, which ho are we in?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.942
- SoHo, NoHo, BoHo?
- Wow.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.444
I do not remember
the prices being this high.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.321
How can they charge
that much for a steak?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.323
It's like the price
of ten thin steaks.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.701
What, did it get a college
education before they killed it?

16:33.742 --> 16:35.953
Uh, I doubt it.
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.080
Oh, wait, this is the lunch menu
I'm looking at.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.083
So the dinner prices..

16:41.125 --> 16:45.087
Okay, no, there is no steak
thick enough.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.131
- Let's go, Fred.
- Okay.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.759
I can't believe I'm about to eat
a New York City hot dog.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.012
Sheila says they're nothing
but sodium and pig lips.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.097
Yeah, and I'm, I'm pretty sure
they're $2, not 10.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.598
You think that guy scammed us

16:56.640 --> 16:58.392
'cause we look like
we're from out of town?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.518
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.228
That seems awfully
mean-spirited.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.064
Hey, do you know how to get to
the Statue of Liberty from here?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.775
Oh, I'm just visiting.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.527
Although I can see
how you would mistake me

17:08.569 --> 17:09.778
for a denizen of this bustling..

17:09.820 --> 17:12.531
- Now that's a knife.
- Whoa.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.117
Whoa, hey, hey.
Somebody, stop that guy.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.537
He just robbed my friend.
Stop..

17:18.579 --> 17:20.539
Okay, or just
go about your business

17:20.581 --> 17:22.332
and ignore the suffering
of others.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.335
I just got mugged.
I love this town.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.427
I'd been trying so hard
to draw a line between me

17:33.469 --> 17:36.138
and the rest of Chatswin
that I'd crossed it.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.268
I owed Evan a sincere apology.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.978
[knocks]

17:43.020 --> 17:45.564
- 'Go away.'
- Evan.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.649
I'm here to say sorry.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.359
I'll even say it
in pirate speak.

17:49.401 --> 17:54.573
I'm so-o-r-rry
for what happened last night.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.868
- Can I come in?
- 'Okay.'

18:02.664 --> 18:06.877
I pretty much cried myself
to sleep on my birthday.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.212
That's terrible.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.172
Your words cut sharper
than a Ginsu.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.423
I feel awful.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.674
I guess I just didn't realize

18:12.716 --> 18:13.801
that was what you thought of me.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.302
Look, it, it doesn't matter

18:15.344 --> 18:18.138
what I think of you,
I should've kept my mouth shut.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.057
You know, sometimes I think
it's easier to focus

18:20.099 --> 18:23.477
on other people's issues
than your own.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.562
I guess we're not so different
after all.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.649
Not quite sure
how you got there, but--

18:28.690 --> 18:32.027
Can I just have a hug?
Uh, I guess.

18:35.572 --> 18:36.949
- Uh..
- Boy-yoi-yoing.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.368
Okay, I am never talking
to you ever again.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.079
Worth it, it happened
and it was documented on video.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.541
I may never be able to name
17 great things about Evan

18:45.582 --> 18:47.584
but he did figure out
how to get an ass grab

18:47.626 --> 18:50.295
on his birthday,
so I guess if nothing else

18:50.337 --> 18:52.381
he's resourceful
and you'd have to be

18:52.422 --> 18:54.550
to survive 17 years
in Chatswin.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.219
Okay, George, tell me
everything about the city

18:57.261 --> 18:58.720
and don't leave out
a single detail.

18:58.762 --> 19:02.141
Oh, yeah, okay, well,
uh, where do I begin?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.893
Uh, there were just
these awesome crowds.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.771
You know,
so many people just..

19:07.813 --> 19:10.440
...energized right in your face

19:10.482 --> 19:13.735
[clears throat]
Uh, and all,
all our favorite hotspots

19:13.777 --> 19:17.531
became, you know,
supremely expensive

19:17.573 --> 19:19.199
and the stench of urine just--

19:19.241 --> 19:22.995
- Hits you like a wall. Bam.
- Bam.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.000
I am so glad I grew up
in Manhattan and not Chatswin.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.334
Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?

19:29.376 --> 19:31.170
This place
with its courteous people

19:31.211 --> 19:34.173
and low crime rate and
reasonably priced thin steaks

19:34.214 --> 19:37.634
and free refills on your drinks,
it's the worst.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.428
Sometimes, the way
we see ourselves

19:39.469 --> 19:41.722
doesn't exactly line up
with who we are.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.348
And for George,
came the surprise

19:43.390 --> 19:46.143
that his hometown
didn't feel like home anymore.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.730
Somehow, someway,
he had become more attached

19:49.771 --> 19:52.065
to Chatswin
than he ever meant to.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.114
You guys
get a new lighting fixture?

19:59.156 --> 20:00.282
Yeah, it's a little much.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.366
The crazy lady down the street

20:01.408 --> 20:03.410
blackmailed us into buying it.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.537
It doesn't exactly look like
it belongs here.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.916
No, but, I like it.
It's got character.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.464
(female #2)
'No, you can't get pregnant
underwater.'

20:15.505 --> 20:19.009
So needless to say
we're both taking scuba.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.638
Yeah, that's what
scuba stands for.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.807
Sperm Cannot Underwater
Be Activated.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.685
That's not
what scuba stands for.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.104
But there was no point.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.732
Chatswin was always
going to be Chatswin.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.859
There was nothing I could do
to change that.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.404
Tessa, I hear you were talking
smack about me the other day.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.823
Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.659
I have to learn
how to keep my mouth shut.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.494
No, I liked it.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.079
No one ever calls me out
on anything

20:47.120 --> 20:49.331
because I'm in a wheelchair,
but you did

20:49.373 --> 20:51.959
and I just wanna say thanks.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.213
You're glad I called you
a two-faced klepto?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.174
Because I am one
and sometimes getting called out

20:59.216 --> 21:01.927
makes you realize
it's time to change.

21:01.969 --> 21:06.515
Here's your hoodie
and your zucchini bread

21:06.556 --> 21:09.393
and your 4D batteries.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.435
All this was in my--

21:10.477 --> 21:11.853
Yeah, here's the combination

21:11.895 --> 21:14.356
lock to your locker.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.732
And I just wanna tell you
to your face

21:15.774 --> 21:18.819
that I've never really
been a big fan of yours.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.404
Until now.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.031
Thanks?

21:24.574 --> 21:26.535
Here's your travel mug.
