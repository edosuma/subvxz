¶¶¶

00:05.464 --> 00:08.590
<i> OLMEC:</i>
<i> Mere mortals on an adventure</i>

00:08.634 --> 00:12.636
<i> to prove they are heroes</i>
<i>worthy of entering my temple...</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:14.388
[shrieks]

00:14.432 --> 00:17.766
<i> ...thrust into an epic legend</i>
<i> told by generations</i>

00:17.810 --> 00:21.729
<i> of oral storytellers like me.</i>

00:21.772 --> 00:23.897
<i> Many versions</i>
<i> of these legends exist,</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:27.776
<i> but there is only one...</i>

00:32.575 --> 00:35.701
<i> These four teams have a chance</i>
<i> to become heroes</i>

00:35.745 --> 00:41.331
<i> and win a king's ransom...</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:46.462
<i> But only one team may enter</i>
<i> my temple to try,</i>

00:46.505 --> 00:49.089
<i> and here's their guide</i>
<i> to tell them how to do it--</i>

00:49.133 --> 00:52.593
<i> Cristela Alonzo.</i>

00:52.636 --> 00:54.219
Thanks, Olmec. Hey, everybody!

00:54.263 --> 00:56.472
Ahh!

00:56.515 --> 00:58.140
You wanna go on an adventure?
Let's do it.

00:58.184 --> 01:01.310
It's so great to see you!

01:01.353 --> 01:04.354
Great to see you, too,
Cristela.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.065
You've been working out?

01:06.108 --> 01:09.193
-I am pretty buff, aren't I?
-[laughs]

01:09.236 --> 01:13.447
Olmec, your temple is full
of lost treasures

01:13.491 --> 01:16.909
from the most amazing legends
in history.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.369
What legend are our heroes
living today?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.880
This is one of my cultures.
Like, this is awesome.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.466
One of these four teams
of heroes has the chance

01:32.510 --> 01:34.635
to enter your temple
to retrieve

01:34.678 --> 01:37.721
the Lucky Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
of the Hero Twins

01:37.765 --> 01:40.516
and win that king's ransom.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.059
Will it be...
the Purple Parrots--

01:42.103 --> 01:44.561
best friends
Travis and Tom?

01:44.605 --> 01:48.482
The Red Jaguars--
soul sisters Jo'el and Dyaman?

01:48.526 --> 01:50.984
The Green Monkeys--besties who
bonded over partying,

01:51.028 --> 01:53.612
Chelsea and Maddie?

01:53.656 --> 01:57.491
Or the Blue Barracudas--
roommates John and Connor?

01:57.535 --> 02:00.035
We're both musicians.
We play pop rock music.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.954
I am probably
Taylor Swift's biggest fan.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.790
We may look like we're
in a boyband, but watch out,

02:04.834 --> 02:07.835
'cause the Blue Barracudas
are coming for you.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.129
We met at a party in college.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.339
We come from cheerleading
and dance backgrounds.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.925
I was an OSU cheerleader.
Go, Bucks.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.885
My mother recently passed away
in March,

02:16.929 --> 02:19.304
and we used to watch the show
all the time together,

02:19.348 --> 02:21.098
and I just know she's up there
rooting for me,

02:21.142 --> 02:23.433
'cause she was
my number one fan.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.060
We're gonna do this for Cynthia.

02:25.104 --> 02:28.355
CRISTELA: Before we let our
heroes loose to cross your moat,

02:28.399 --> 02:32.484
Olmec, tell us more
about their mission.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.862
This story comes from
the sacred book of the Maya

02:34.905 --> 02:37.739
called the<i> Popol Vuh.</i>

02:37.783 --> 02:41.368
The Hero Twins are conceived
when their goddess mother Xquic

02:41.412 --> 02:45.914
stops to admire a fruit tree
growing near a sport court

02:45.958 --> 02:50.544
used for the Maya ball game
called<i> Pok-ta-Pok.</i>

02:50.588 --> 02:53.755
The fruit tree is inhabited
by the reincarnated spirit

02:53.799 --> 02:58.260
of Hunahpu, a heroic warrior
who spits magical black seeds

02:58.304 --> 03:03.599
into Xquic's hands, and voilà,
she's pregnant with twins.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.392
She names the twins Hunahpu

03:05.436 --> 03:08.687
after their father
and Xbalanqué.

03:08.731 --> 03:12.274
They grow up hearing stories of
their father's heroic efforts,

03:12.318 --> 03:14.651
discovering that he was murdered

03:14.695 --> 03:17.404
by two evil lords
of the underworld

03:17.448 --> 03:20.324
named One Death and Seven Death.

03:20.367 --> 03:25.662
So they set out on an epic quest
to avenge their father's murder,

03:25.706 --> 03:30.792
and they took their lucky ball
with them everywhere they went.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.463
We met doing hardcore shows,
death metal shows.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.423
We both play in different bands.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.467
-And now we're metal dads.
-We are both dads now, yeah.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.303
Yeah, whether it's like crazy
metal band, jumping off a stage,

03:41.347 --> 03:43.263
or changing diapers,
we are the Hero Twins.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.849
Like, we embody them fully.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.186
Me and Maddie--we're always down
for a fun time.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.771
Ride or die.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.314
Green Monkeys are here
to win rent money because--

03:52.358 --> 03:55.359
Yes. I need a new car.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.488
CRISTELA: Our teams are about
to start a quest full

03:59.531 --> 04:02.866
of physical and mental tests to
determine which team is worthy

04:02.910 --> 04:04.576
of entering your temple.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.954
The first test is crossing
your moat.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.872
Olmec,
how are we doing it today?

04:08.916 --> 04:12.793
Before the heroes avenge
their father's murder,

04:12.836 --> 04:14.086
they get some practice

04:14.129 --> 04:17.923
on a conceited bird named
Seven Macaw.

04:17.967 --> 04:22.135
You are the Twins taking down
the bad bird.

04:22.179 --> 04:26.181
On Cristela's signal,
push your raft into the moat,

04:26.225 --> 04:27.683
then pull a stone
out of that bag

04:27.726 --> 04:31.770
and use those slinging devices
to knock the birdbrain

04:31.814 --> 04:33.480
into the water.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.107
Grab the drowning demon

04:35.150 --> 04:37.943
and swim him
to the other side of the moat,

04:37.987 --> 04:40.487
where you must assemble
the clue off his back

04:40.531 --> 04:43.949
to identify the only potion
guaranteed to kill him

04:43.993 --> 04:46.201
once and for all.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.954
Find the two bottles
that, when mixed,

04:48.998 --> 04:52.332
create the right venom,
then drag the foul fowl

04:52.376 --> 04:54.543
out of the moat
to finish him off.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.796
The first three teams
to slay Seven Macaw

04:57.840 --> 05:02.009
and strike their gong
continue on their quest.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.594
The last team is out.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.973
BOTH: Bring on the<i> moat!</i>

05:08.017 --> 05:10.851
-Heroes, are you ready?
-Yes!

05:10.894 --> 05:12.227
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

05:12.271 --> 05:15.772
Hey, Olmec, are you ready?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.941
Oh, yeah!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.693
CRISTELA: On your mark...

05:19.737 --> 05:21.820
get set...go!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.905
¶¶¶

05:23.949 --> 05:25.532
It's a quick start.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.659
Once they get to the end
of their lines,

05:27.703 --> 05:30.037
the person on the raft
can knock Seven Macaw

05:30.080 --> 05:32.664
off his perch.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.915
Ooh, the Red Jaguars are,
like, straight to it.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.168
They don't even mess around.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.170
What most people don't know
is that cheerleaders

05:38.213 --> 05:40.422
are some of the most athletic
people on earth,

05:40.466 --> 05:43.967
and so we're definitely gonna do
our best to get to that temple.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.386
CRISTELA:
Blue Barracudas are up, too.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.973
Green Monkeys and Purple Parrots
are a little wobbly.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.099
Uhh!

05:51.143 --> 05:52.768
I wanted to beat
the other teams.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.645
I want them to see that we're
a force to be reckoned with.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.105
You got it, you got it,
you got it.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.025
CRISTELA: Oh, here come
the Green Monkeys.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.651
I grew up
as a competitive swimmer,

06:01.695 --> 06:04.613
so I feel pretty good.
Cut to us literally drowning.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.989
[laughter]

06:06.033 --> 06:07.657
Get him!

06:07.701 --> 06:10.243
¶¶¶

06:10.287 --> 06:12.871
Oh!

06:12.915 --> 06:15.040
I was definitely impressed
when she nailed that bird.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.750
¶¶¶

06:16.794 --> 06:18.794
CRISTELA: Now the Red Jaguars
have to swim

06:18.837 --> 06:21.922
Seven Macaw across the moat
and decipher the clue.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.590
We're not the biggest fans
of water,

06:23.634 --> 06:27.260
but what we are gonna do
is<i> try</i> to be the best,

06:27.304 --> 06:28.970
'cause I mean,
at the end of the day, like,

06:29.014 --> 06:32.307
who wants to be wet
looking like this? Like, ooh.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.601
CRISTELA: Once the Red Jaguars
assemble the clue,

06:34.645 --> 06:37.354
they have to figure out what
it's telling them to look for.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.898
All right, bird, you're mine!

06:39.942 --> 06:41.358
<i> -[caws]</i>
-Oh!

06:41.402 --> 06:42.234
<i> Wow!</i>

06:42.277 --> 06:44.736
-Get him!
<i> -[caws]</i>

06:44.780 --> 06:45.737
CRISTELA: Now the Monkeys
and Purple Parrots

06:45.781 --> 06:47.739
are on to the clue.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.159
The Blue Barracudas
may need a new strategy.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.619
-Pull me up?
-Go, go, go, go.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.288
We saw, like, birds going down,
birds going down,

06:55.332 --> 06:58.792
and we're sitting there shaking,
and nothing's even close.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.044
CRISTELA: Purple Parrots are
on the clue,

07:01.088 --> 07:03.255
but they'd better hurry.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.798
Poison.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.675
CRISTELA: Poison is right.
Now they have to find

07:06.718 --> 07:10.053
the two bottles
that combine to make the venom.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.639
The bottles are
a little bit tricky.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.057
I do have a full set
of acrylics,

07:14.101 --> 07:15.725
but that won't hold me back.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.478
CRISTELA: Red Jaguars are
already looking for the poison.

07:18.522 --> 07:22.149
Purple Parrots and Green Monkeys
are on the clue.

07:22.192 --> 07:25.068
Blue Barracudas still trying
to blast Seven Macaw.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.736
You're so close,
you're so close.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.448
Okay, I got "poi."
We need "son."

07:29.491 --> 07:31.324
CRISTELA: The Red Jaguars
better hurry.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.995
Purple Parrots and Green Monkeys
are right on their heels.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.790
Oh! Come on!
Are you kidding me?!

07:38.834 --> 07:41.626
Yeah, I don't know how many
curse words I said,

07:41.670 --> 07:42.961
but I hate that bird.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.045
CRISTELA: Purple Parrots
are having trouble

07:44.089 --> 07:45.589
decoding the clue.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.590
It was super confusing
at first.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.216
Yeah.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.260
'Cause you couldn't really tell
exactly what it was.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.387
An octopus
with a human skeleton.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.931
¶¶¶

07:54.975 --> 07:56.933
CRISTELA: Ah, the Red Jaguars
have the venom

07:56.977 --> 07:58.393
and can exit the moat.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.270
Got it! Go get it!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.980
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas
are back in this.

08:02.024 --> 08:05.400
They only need to beat one team
to move on to the next round.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.069
They've gotta poison the bird
before they hit the gong.

08:08.113 --> 08:17.704
¶¶¶

08:17.748 --> 08:19.998
The Red Jaguars are the first
team to cross the moat.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.918
They are one step closer
to the Temple Run.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.586
My mom cannot believe it
right now.

08:24.630 --> 08:28.882
She's up in Heaven, loving this,
like, "Go, baby, go, baby, go!"

08:28.926 --> 08:30.300
CRISTELA: We need two more teams
to advance--

08:30.344 --> 08:31.635
Purple Parrots,
the Green Monkeys,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.887
or the Blue Barracudas.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.680
-Go?
-Let's go.

08:35.724 --> 08:39.601
-Call me in hell, bird!
-Aah!

08:39.645 --> 08:41.686
¶¶¶

08:41.730 --> 08:44.189
CRISTELA: The Purple Parrots are
the second team moving on.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.733
Metal clearly triumphs
over everything.

08:46.777 --> 08:47.651
Yeah.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.861
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

08:49.905 --> 08:51.446
We got Red Jaguars.
We got Purple Parrots.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.366
Only one spot left. Right now
we've got the Green Monkeys

08:54.409 --> 08:56.576
still getting close,
but you know what?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.161
The Blue Barracudas
are right behind.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.664
We got one space left.
Which will it be?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.875
-We have "poi."
-I've got "ram," "son."

09:03.919 --> 09:06.253
We have 3-letter words
that meant nothing to us.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.170
-Blanked hard.
-We're sitting there, like,

09:07.214 --> 09:10.048
"sun," "man," "poi," "ram."

09:10.092 --> 09:13.468
My bottles are
in a complete knot.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.387
-"Poi"?
-Poison.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.513
"Poi," "poi."

09:16.557 --> 09:18.139
-What do you have?
-"Poi."

09:18.183 --> 09:21.810
It's not just yours. It's one--
It's one of both of ours.

09:21.853 --> 09:31.236
¶¶¶

09:31.280 --> 09:33.446
CRISTELA: Our final team
is the Green Monkeys!

09:33.490 --> 09:35.865
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:35.909 --> 09:37.867
It just goes to show girl power.
We got this.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.745
We're scrappy,
and we get it done.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.330
Blue Barracudas,
you did fantastic out there.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.375
Unfortunately, you were
the last team to come in,

09:45.419 --> 09:47.085
so you won't be moving on
to the next round,

09:47.129 --> 09:49.629
but you're not going home
empty-handed.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.423
You get to keep
your Blue Barracuda t-shirts.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.466
Still pretty awesome.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.386
Moving on to the next round,
and one step closer

09:56.430 --> 09:59.389
to the Temple Run
and $25,000 are...

09:59.433 --> 10:00.640
-Let's go!
-Whoo!

10:00.684 --> 10:02.058
...Red Jaguars,

10:02.102 --> 10:03.852
Purple Parrots,
and the Green Monkeys.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.770
-Whoo!
-Coming up next,

10:05.814 --> 10:07.063
they've got to show us
how smart they are

10:07.107 --> 10:09.190
in the Steps of Knowledge
right when we come back.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.734
Stay tuned.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.944
¶¶¶

10:15.115 --> 10:16.698
[cheering]

10:16.742 --> 10:18.783
Welcome back to the "Legends
of the Hidden Temple."

10:18.827 --> 10:20.452
Red Jaguars,
how are you feeling?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.162
You think you're ready
for this next game?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.580
We're so excited.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.831
We're ready to take on
the Steps of Knowledge

10:24.875 --> 10:26.541
and take it on
to the next round.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.586
Listen up, everyone. We saw how
fast you were crossing the moat.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.296
Now let's see how smart you are.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.716
I need you all
to listen carefully

10:34.760 --> 10:36.968
as Olmec tells you
the origin of

10:37.012 --> 10:40.055
the Lucky Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
of the Hero Twins.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.683
After defeating Seven Macaw,

10:43.727 --> 10:46.311
the twins were invited
to a game of Pok-Ta-Pok

10:46.355 --> 10:48.605
against the lords
of the underworld.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.399
Unaware the boys are the sons
of Hunahpu

10:51.443 --> 10:53.610
and out for revenge,

10:53.654 --> 10:55.779
the lords immediately put them
to the tests

10:55.822 --> 10:58.073
that led
to their father's death.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.449
They passed the first two.

10:59.493 --> 11:03.828
However, the third test
is not so easy.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.414
Take these lit cigars
into the House of Darkness

11:06.458 --> 11:10.168
and keep them lit
all night long.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.962
OLMEC: Maya stogies can't stay
lit all night,

11:13.006 --> 11:16.132
so the twins collect fireflies,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.217
put them on the ends
of the cigars,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.844
and fool the lords.

11:19.888 --> 11:23.473
Cool tests, Lords. Thanks.
We're outta here.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.600
Not so fast.
To the House of Bats.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.436
OLMEC: The twins hide
from the blood-sucking bats

11:28.480 --> 11:32.565
by shrinking themselves down
and hiding in their blowguns.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.360
So the lords send them
to the Cold House,

11:35.404 --> 11:39.614
where they use fire to block
the freezing cold.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.784
Man, these dudes aren't
giving up till we're dead!

11:42.828 --> 11:44.786
OLMEC: They devise a plan
to compete in Pok-Ta-Pok,

11:44.830 --> 11:48.581
knowing if they lose,
they will be put to death.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.627
Hey, Hunahpu, grab
our lucky ball, and let's die!

11:52.671 --> 11:54.421
OLMEC:
The twins lose the game,

11:54.464 --> 11:57.632
and the lords grind them in
their ball into a fine powder,

11:57.676 --> 12:00.260
pouring them into the river.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.596
When the powder is out of sight,
it magically reconstitutes

12:03.640 --> 12:07.809
into the Hero Twins
and their Pok-Ta-Pok ball,

12:07.853 --> 12:11.813
which is now
their Lucky Losing Ball.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.690
I feel like
we're the Hero Twins.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.275
We're pretty savage
when we need to be,

12:15.318 --> 12:17.444
and if we have to do what we
have to do, we're gonna do it.

12:17.487 --> 12:22.365
We're the Purple Parrots, and
we're gonna be one step<i> ahead!</i>

12:22.409 --> 12:24.451
These are
the Steps of Knowledge.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.660
Olmec will be
asking you questions

12:25.704 --> 12:27.620
about the legend you just heard.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.081
He'll also ask
general knowledge questions

12:30.125 --> 12:32.333
related to the story.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.335
Once he asks the questions,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.463
stop on the ancient marks
in front of you.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.548
If correct,
you'll take a step down.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.134
If not, or if you take
too long to answer,

12:41.178 --> 12:43.678
the other teams
will have a chance.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.346
The first two teams
to come down

12:45.390 --> 12:47.682
will move on
to the Temple Games.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.476
The last team will be out.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.935
We're prepared to come in,

12:50.979 --> 12:53.104
listen to what "Olmen"
has to say,

12:53.148 --> 12:55.231
and answer all the questions
correct so we can get

12:55.275 --> 12:56.357
to the bottom of the stairs.
-It's<i> Olmec.</i>

12:56.401 --> 12:57.484
-Olmec?
-Yes.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.068
What did I say?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.321
Olmec,
first question, please.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.615
¶¶¶

13:03.658 --> 13:06.284
What game do
the Hero Twins play?

13:06.328 --> 13:07.327
[bell rattles]

13:07.370 --> 13:09.037
CRISTELA: Red Jaguars.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.164
-Pok-Ta-Pok.
-OLMEC: That is correct.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.293
One step down. Congratulations.
Olmec, next question, please.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.295
What was the name
of the opponent

13:17.339 --> 13:19.714
the Hero Twins defeat?
-[bell rattles]

13:19.758 --> 13:22.175
CRISTELA: Green Monkeys?

13:22.219 --> 13:23.468
¶¶¶

13:23.512 --> 13:26.179
-The Lords of Death?
-Incorrect.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.347
[bell rattles]

13:27.390 --> 13:28.723
Purple Parrots?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.184
Seven Macaw.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.936
That is correct.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.939
Oh! Congratulations,
Purple Parrots.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.441
Olmec, next question.

13:38.485 --> 13:42.779
This Hero Twins story
originated in Central America,

13:42.823 --> 13:45.114
in particular,
parts of Guatemala.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.660
What does the name "Guatemala"
mean?

13:48.703 --> 13:53.373
Is it "Hills of Jade,"
"Land of Many Trees,"

13:53.416 --> 13:57.502
"Volcanic Landscape,"
or "Cradle of Chocolate"?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.170
[bell rattles]

13:59.214 --> 14:00.755
Red Jaguars?

14:00.799 --> 14:03.466
-"Hills of Jade."
-Incorrect.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.134
-[bell rattles]
-Purple Parrots.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.761
Land of Many Trees.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.388
OLMEC: That is correct!

14:08.431 --> 14:11.599
Oh, one step down. You are
one away from moving forward

14:11.643 --> 14:14.018
to the Temple Games.
Olmec, next question, please.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.230
What kind of creature
helps the twins

14:17.274 --> 14:18.857
in their cigar test?
-[bell rattles]

14:18.900 --> 14:19.941
Red Jaguars.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.026
-Fireflies.
-That is correct.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.820
Oh, neck and neck!

14:23.864 --> 14:25.071
-Oh, Red Jaguars...
-Come on!

14:25.115 --> 14:26.865
...Purple Parrots.
Who will be first?

14:26.908 --> 14:28.992
Green Monkeys,
it's anybody's game.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.994
Olmec, next question.

14:31.037 --> 14:34.914
What traditional dolls
originated in Guatemala?

14:34.958 --> 14:39.043
Paper dolls, porcelain dolls,
voodoo dolls,

14:39.087 --> 14:40.795
or worry dolls?

14:40.839 --> 14:42.088
-[bell rattles]
-Purple Parrots?

14:42.132 --> 14:45.300
-Worry dolls.
-OLMEC: That is correct!

14:45.343 --> 14:47.510
Oh! And the Purple Parrots
are the first team

14:47.554 --> 14:49.429
to move forward
to the Temple Games.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.055
Jaguars might be quick,

14:51.099 --> 14:53.850
but the Parrots will always
fly high.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.311
Who will join them?
No one knows.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.438
This view from up here
on the top of the steps--

14:58.481 --> 15:00.857
it's not cute.
Need to get down there<i> quick.</i>

15:00.901 --> 15:02.066
Yeah.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.027
CRISTELA:
Olmec, next question.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.739
Who was the Hero Twin Hunahpu
named after?

15:07.782 --> 15:08.740
[bell rattles]

15:08.783 --> 15:09.866
Green Monkeys?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.618
His father.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.369
OLMEC: That is correct!

15:13.413 --> 15:16.039
Oh, yes! Green Monkeys! [laughs]

15:16.082 --> 15:18.291
There's still hope for us.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.083
-There's still hope.
-There's still hope.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.169
Olmec, next question.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.297
Where did the twins go
for their third test?

15:24.341 --> 15:25.757
[bell rattles]

15:25.800 --> 15:28.343
-CRISTELA: Green Monkeys.
-House of Bats?

15:28.386 --> 15:31.930
OLMEC: That is incorrect.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.848
-[bell rattles]
-Red Jaguars.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.893
House of Darkness.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.062
OLMEC: That is correct.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.438
-Oh!
-CRISTELA: Red Jaguars,

15:40.482 --> 15:43.316
you're moving on
to the Temple Games.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.943
-Oh, man.
-[cheering]

15:44.986 --> 15:47.028
We are so stoked right now.
We can't believe it.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.279
We're still gonna bring it
through for the ladies.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.405
Let's go.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.991
Boys drool, and girls rule.

15:52.035 --> 15:55.203
-We're good, we're good.
-Green Monkeys, I am so sorry.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.455
But unfortunately, that means
you're not moving on.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.040
I'm not gonna be able
to sleep tonight, tomorrow--

15:59.084 --> 16:00.333
I'm having a sangria
in 15 minutes.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.751
Yeah.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.211
But you are not leaving
empty-handed.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.338
Please tell 'em what they won.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.298
<i> ANNOUNCER: On top of</i>
<i> your Green Monkey shirts,</i>

16:07.342 --> 16:08.800
<i> you're going home</i>
<i> with a whole bunch of</i>

16:08.843 --> 16:10.259
<i> "Legends of the Hidden Temple"</i>
<i> signature swag.</i>

16:10.303 --> 16:12.929
Yes! Whoo!

16:12.973 --> 16:15.390
<i>Including limited edition hats,</i>
<i> beach towels, sports chairs,</i>

16:15.433 --> 16:18.184
<i> Spikeball sets,</i>
<i> and giant Olmec party coolers</i>

16:18.228 --> 16:21.229
<i> for each of you.</i>

16:21.272 --> 16:24.148
We got the Red Jaguars
and the Purple Parrots.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.441
These two teams
are one step closer

16:25.485 --> 16:28.361
to racing through Olmec's temple
for $25,000.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.948
Stay tuned. Whoo! Yeah!

16:34.119 --> 16:38.204
[cheering]

16:38.248 --> 16:40.456
Oh, welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

16:40.500 --> 16:42.875
You've seen our heroes
cross Olmec's moat

16:42.919 --> 16:45.378
and make their way down
the Steps of Knowledge.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.089
Now the only thing
standing between them

16:48.133 --> 16:51.634
and a shot at $25,000
are these Temple Games.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.177
Still with us,
we have Tom and Travis,

16:53.221 --> 16:54.887
the Purple Parrots.
-Yeah!

16:54.931 --> 16:56.723
Temple Games are what I was
looking forward to the most.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.558
They're so wacky sometimes.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.059
Like, I just can't wait to see
what they're gonna throw at us.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.228
Red Jaguars right here.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.898
Now both teams will be competing
for these...

17:05.942 --> 17:08.192
Pendants of Life.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.944
The first team to collect
two Pendants of Life

17:09.988 --> 17:12.655
have proven themselves worthy

17:12.699 --> 17:15.616
and will be invited to enter
Olmec's temple.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.785
First Temple Game,
they're playing head to head.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.080
So, teams, go and get ready.

17:21.124 --> 17:25.501
And Olmec will tell us more
about Temple Game number one.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.712
Before being reincarnated,

17:27.756 --> 17:30.798
Hunahpu and Xbalanqué
faced many tests

17:30.842 --> 17:35.219
at the hands
of the lords of the underworld.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.389
In this game,
you are the Hero Twins

17:38.433 --> 17:41.768
facing the same tests.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.146
When Cristela gives the signal,
go to the House of Darkness

17:45.190 --> 17:48.066
and use your blowguns
to collect five fireflies

17:48.109 --> 17:53.321
without touching the flies
with your hands.

17:53.364 --> 17:56.991
Then proceed
to the House of Bats.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.994
Use those planks
to build a bridge

18:00.038 --> 18:01.788
that will get you
out of the house,

18:01.831 --> 18:04.624
then shrink yourselves
into those blow guns

18:04.667 --> 18:06.959
and roll them across the bridge.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.587
Climb over
and under the obstacles

18:09.631 --> 18:12.465
to arrive at the House of Cold,

18:12.509 --> 18:15.426
where you must both get
into the ice bath

18:15.470 --> 18:17.095
and search for wood
to build a fire

18:17.138 --> 18:19.388
to keep you warm.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.058
The first team to pass
these three tests

18:22.102 --> 18:25.436
and hit their gong wins.

18:25.480 --> 18:30.024
Parrots mean only one thing
to a Jaguar in the jungle.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.235
BOTH: Lunch.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.278
In our story,
we're the Hero Twins,

18:34.322 --> 18:37.281
but the Red Jaguars--they're
One Death and Seven Death.

18:37.325 --> 18:41.494
-[exhales deeply] Savage.
-And our job...

18:41.538 --> 18:42.745
BOTH: Take 'em down.

18:42.789 --> 18:47.667
All right, teams,
on your mark...get set...

18:47.710 --> 18:48.960
go!

18:49.003 --> 18:52.255
¶¶¶

18:52.298 --> 18:53.673
-Come on.
-I'm trying.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.925
Push it higher.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.677
Go on the other side?
Great. Yeah. Come on.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.513
CRISTELA: Both teams got the
first of five fireflies down,

19:00.557 --> 19:02.473
<i> but they don't count</i>
<i> till they are in the bowl.</i>

19:02.517 --> 19:06.978
Tom and Travis are first.
Four more to go.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.938
Get it by. Get it by.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.898
Yeah. Get it, get it.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.358
Yeah. Come on, come on, come on.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.484
We're trying to move
as quick as we can

19:13.528 --> 19:15.111
'cause we wanna get ahead
of the boys.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.529
You gotta get it like that.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.738
It's all about communication,
basically.

19:17.782 --> 19:18.823
It's very difficult.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.869
¶¶¶

19:22.912 --> 19:25.037
-Like that?
-Like right on top.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.164
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh!

19:26.207 --> 19:28.374
The Red Jaguars need four more.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.667
No, you get on this side.
I'll get on the other side.

19:29.711 --> 19:30.751
Get on the other side
of the string.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.920
What side? There.
Now pull it down.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.506
Get it. Whoa.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.551
-Okay, you got it?
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.677
Come on, come on.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.179
You got it? Yeah.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.930
<i> All tied up.</i>
<i> Three more for each team.</i>

19:42.974 --> 19:45.224
¶¶¶

19:45.268 --> 19:47.393
It wasn't easy.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.312
We might've kinda been
fighting against each other...

19:49.355 --> 19:50.938
-Yeah.
-...for a minute.

19:50.982 --> 19:54.984
CRISTELA: Oh, look, Tom and
Travis working on two at once.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.986
Ambitious!

19:57.030 --> 19:59.155
-You got this?
-Yeah.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.365
All right. 1, 2, 3.

20:01.409 --> 20:05.286
¶¶¶

20:05.330 --> 20:08.164
Hold this until I...
Yeah, yeah. Get it, get it.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.999
-Get it.
-Oh, shoot.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.250
It's right behind you,
right behind you.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.711
CRISTELA: Jo'el and Dyaman
better hustle.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.963
The Purple Parrots
are on their last one.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.758
¶¶¶

20:18.801 --> 20:20.509
Okay, let's go!

20:20.553 --> 20:22.845
CRISTELA: Oh, Tom and Travis are
moving on to the House of Bats.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.181
First, they have to
build that bridge.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.309
¶¶¶

20:28.353 --> 20:30.603
-They're already done?
-Yeah.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.104
We should've just thought
outside of the box

20:32.148 --> 20:33.940
a little bit more,
'cause the boys definitely were

20:33.983 --> 20:37.318
less delicate
getting the fireflies down.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.871
Now they have to shrink down
into their blowguns,

20:48.915 --> 20:50.122
and that's a lot of shrinking
for Travis.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.166
-Ready?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

20:52.210 --> 20:56.796
Oh, my God.
I'm too big for this. [grunts]

20:56.839 --> 20:58.297
Oh! We didn't go over.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.925
I think my height was
an advantage getting the--

21:00.969 --> 21:02.426
the fireflies down.
-For sure.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.179
But then the rest of it--
not even close.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.598
CRISTELA: This could be Dyaman
and Jo'el's chance to catch up,

21:07.642 --> 21:10.268
but they still have
one more firefly to catch.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.394
Throw your weight.
Throw your weight.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.272
[grunts]

21:14.315 --> 21:15.773
Oh, oh, look.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.066
-Roll. Roll, roll, roll.
-Okay.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.025
Go, go, go, go, go.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.069
Oh, my God. I'm drunk. You good?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.654
CRISTELA: Ha! Drunk?

21:21.698 --> 21:24.573
The House of Cold
will sober him up.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.533
¶¶¶

21:25.576 --> 21:27.576
-Come on.
-I'm trying.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.704
CRISTELA:
Finally, Jo'el and Dyaman

21:29.747 --> 21:31.706
are on to the House of Bats,

21:31.749 --> 21:34.250
but Tom and Travis
have a huge lead.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.544
They got the ball to knock down
a lot quicker than we did,

21:36.587 --> 21:38.045
but nothing
that we can't handle.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.132
¶¶¶

21:41.175 --> 21:42.383
[grunts] You good?

21:42.427 --> 21:45.094
Yeah, just... [laughs]
Come on.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.305
I'm too big for all this stuff.
[coughs]

21:47.348 --> 21:49.015
Oh, damn.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.475
-Ooh, that water is cold.
-That's nice. It feels good.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.937
Ooh, they're going in.
That's ice, ice, ice cold water.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.188
Yeah, go with the biggest pieces
on the bottom.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.898
-Yup.
-There. Big ones.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.191
-Okay, this one?
-Descending order.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.735
Here, this is the next one.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.446
¶¶¶

22:03.489 --> 22:06.240
CRISTELA: Wow! Jo'el and Dyaman
use their cheerleading skills

22:06.284 --> 22:08.159
on those blowguns.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.785
Let's see how they do
on the obstacles.

22:09.829 --> 22:15.666
¶¶¶

22:15.710 --> 22:19.712
Oh, man, but the Red Jaguars
are catching up.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.339
They're right there
with the Purple Parrots.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.841
This all comes down to who
builds the fastest fire.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.301
That one?

22:25.345 --> 22:27.011
-Here, just give...
-Nope, we got one more.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.180
CRISTELA:
It's anyone's game now.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.390
¶¶¶

22:31.434 --> 22:32.892
Flames on my side. Flip it.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.518
Good, good?

22:34.562 --> 22:36.437
-Go, brother, go!
-Yeah, yeah!

22:36.481 --> 22:38.105
¶¶¶

22:38.149 --> 22:40.566
CRISTELA: Ooh, and the Purple
Parrots have hit the gong.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.318
-Yes!
-Oh, man.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.528
That challenge was intense.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.073
Purple Parrots,
you came in first, which means

22:47.116 --> 22:49.158
you get one Pendant of Life.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.659
But don't worry,
Dyaman and Jo'el,

22:50.703 --> 22:53.537
you still get a chance
to redeem yourself

22:53.581 --> 22:57.917
in Temple Game number two
when we come back. Whoo-hoo!

22:57.960 --> 22:58.918
Wow.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.047
Whoo!

23:03.091 --> 23:05.341
Welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

23:05.385 --> 23:06.550
Congratulations, Purple Parrots.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.594
You have won
one Pendant of Life,

23:08.638 --> 23:10.888
but remember,
you need two of them

23:10.932 --> 23:12.348
to move on to the Temple Run.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.100
I have another one here
in my pocket,

23:14.143 --> 23:17.061
and it is up for grabs,
so Temple Game number two

23:17.105 --> 23:19.105
is one team at a time.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.606
Purple Parrots, you won
the Steps of Knowledge,

23:20.650 --> 23:22.942
and you have chosen
to go second.

23:22.985 --> 23:27.738
Olmec is going to tell us more
about Temple Game number two.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.616
After the Hero Twins
are reconstituted,

23:30.660 --> 23:34.870
they acquire the ability
to reincarnate living things.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.456
They go on tour disguised
as magicians

23:37.500 --> 23:39.834
like Mayan David Blaines,

23:39.877 --> 23:41.252
cutting living things
into pieces,

23:41.295 --> 23:44.839
then bringing them back
to life.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.841
Their gruesome act

23:46.884 --> 23:50.344
gets the attention
of One Death and Seven Death,

23:50.388 --> 23:54.974
who once again are unaware
they are Hunahpu and Xbalanqué.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.017
The lords demand
a private performance

23:57.061 --> 23:59.395
of the dirty deed.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.021
Do one where you cut us up.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.065
Then you can put us back
together.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.026
OLMEC: The brothers are happy
to oblige.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.030
In this game,
you are the Hero Twins,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.992
bringing that performance
to life.

24:13.035 --> 24:18.247
But first, get into disguise so
the lords don't recognize you.

24:18.291 --> 24:22.209
When Cristela gives the signal,
one of you open that chest

24:22.253 --> 24:25.838
and put on a piece
of your magician's costume.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.298
Describe it to your partner,

24:27.341 --> 24:30.176
who must find the matching item
and put it on.

24:30.219 --> 24:35.264
Once you are properly disguised,
it's showtime.

24:35.308 --> 24:39.643
Run over to the stage and throw
your knives at one of the boards

24:39.687 --> 24:42.855
until there are nine body parts
on the ground.

24:42.899 --> 24:47.651
Indulge the fevered crowd
by throwing all nine body parts

24:47.695 --> 24:49.487
through that Mayan hoop,

24:49.530 --> 24:51.947
then you may hit your gong
and stop the clock.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.949
The team that completes
the magic act

24:53.993 --> 24:58.454
of the Hero Twins fastest
wins.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.538
We're going first,
but we're not scared.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.831
We're gonna set the bar,

25:00.875 --> 25:02.833
and we're gonna set the bar
very high,

25:02.877 --> 25:04.460
and we're gonna try to move
as fast as we can

25:04.504 --> 25:06.170
to make sure that we have
the time to beat.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.423
CRISTELA: Olmec, set the clock.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.634
On your mark...get set...

25:11.677 --> 25:12.510
go!

25:12.553 --> 25:13.886
¶¶¶

25:13.930 --> 25:16.096
Okay, Jo'el and Dyaman need

25:16.140 --> 25:18.390
to communicate loud and clear
through that solid wall.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.602
Uh, cheetah skirt.

25:21.646 --> 25:23.354
¶¶¶

25:23.397 --> 25:26.065
CRISTELA: Technically,
it's a loincloth, but check.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.024
Cheetah poncho!

25:27.068 --> 25:29.193
Go.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.694
CRISTELA: That's a match!

25:30.738 --> 25:32.363
One more piece,
and they're fully disguised!

25:32.406 --> 25:33.906
Cheetah headdress.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.825
We're doing a really good job
with communicating

25:36.869 --> 25:39.537
as far as figuring out
which pieces we're getting out

25:39.580 --> 25:41.080
of the trunk
and which items to put on.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.706
Take it off. Let's go.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.417
CRISTELA: Their outfits match.
Now they can unclip

25:45.461 --> 25:47.211
and head over to do some magic.

25:47.255 --> 25:53.926
¶¶¶

25:53.970 --> 25:55.094
Oh, man.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.473
Wow, Jo'el, into the line of
fire to collect those knives.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.058
I love it.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.978
¶¶¶

26:04.021 --> 26:06.021
Now Dyaman's in the knife path.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.440
These girls really trust
each other.

26:08.484 --> 26:12.403
Okay. The lord's all cut up.
Time for the big finale.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.030
Throw the nine body parts
through the Mayan hoop.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.198
One down, eight more to go.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.534
¶¶¶

26:18.578 --> 26:21.203
This is a lot harder
than it looks.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.247
[grunts]

26:23.291 --> 26:26.625
Those blocks are almost
the same size as the circle.

26:26.669 --> 26:32.506
¶¶¶

26:32.550 --> 26:35.175
Oh, six more. They gotta hurry.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.720
¶¶¶

26:37.763 --> 26:41.682
Five to go, but they are
eating up a lot of time.

26:41.726 --> 26:45.477
¶¶¶

26:45.521 --> 26:50.190
Remember, Dyaman and Jo'el have
to win this game to stay in it.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.651
¶¶¶

26:52.695 --> 26:54.069
They need two more.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.202
That's it! Hit the gong!

27:02.246 --> 27:06.081
¶¶¶

27:06.125 --> 27:07.958
Oh!

27:08.002 --> 27:10.544
The Red Jaguars
have hit the gong.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.880
They finished that challenge
in 3 minutes and 19 seconds.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.840
That means to get
the Pendant of Life,

27:14.884 --> 27:17.384
the Purple Parrots
have to beat that time.

27:17.428 --> 27:18.594
Let's do it.

27:18.638 --> 27:19.970
If I'm going in,
I'm going 110%.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.388
I don't care what it is
that I have to do.

27:21.432 --> 27:24.141
I'm gonna do it just to show
that I can--I can win.

27:24.185 --> 27:25.976
CRISTELA:
All right, Purple Parrots?

27:26.020 --> 27:27.853
All right, Tom and Travis,
if you win this,

27:27.897 --> 27:30.397
you are going to the temple,
but if you lose,

27:30.441 --> 27:32.900
Jo'el and Dyaman
force the tiebreaker.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.861
On your mark, get set...go!

27:35.905 --> 27:38.322
Come on, let's go, Purple.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.032
Got the coat, coat,
go, go, go, go.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.451
CRISTELA: Purple Parrots need
to get the poncho, loincloth,

27:42.495 --> 27:45.371
and headdress on
before they can unclip.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.122
Oh, oh!

27:47.166 --> 27:48.499
Yeah, let's go, y'all.
Get it together.

27:48.542 --> 27:49.958
-You better catch up.
-Go, go, go, go, go, go.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.169
CRISTELA: Oh, they have
the poncho. What's next?

27:52.213 --> 27:53.712
It's not only about physical.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.340
It's also about
mental around here.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.509
-Catch up.
-Loincloth, loincloth.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.426
Yeah, the pants, right?
Yeah, you got it?

27:59.470 --> 28:00.678
-Up, up?
-Yeah. Let's go.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.513
Up?

28:02.556 --> 28:05.057
Oh, the Purple Parrots have
the wrong clothes on.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.393
Got the headdress, headdress,
headdress.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.229
-Let's go, Purple.
-Come on.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.271
-All right, I got it, I got it.
-Got it, all right.

28:11.315 --> 28:14.650
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

28:14.694 --> 28:15.984
-I got the headdress.
-What do we got?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.528
I got the cloth,
and I got the loincloth on.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.238
We figured by observing,

28:19.281 --> 28:21.115
it would give us an advantage,
but it did not.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.659
-Yeah.
-Oh, oh.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.660
-When we went, they...
-Yeah.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.203
They smacked us.

28:26.247 --> 28:27.413
'Cause they didn't need
to observe, so they could

28:27.456 --> 28:28.747
just let it...let loose and...
-Let it rip.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.332
...and distract us
from communicating.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.667
What do you got?
What are you mixed up with?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.252
There's a pants.
There's a pants in here.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.921
Nah, no, loincloth, dude.
Loincloth.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.465
-Come on, brother.
-The clock is ticking, honey.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.926
Loincloth, with just
one long section in the front.

28:40.970 --> 28:41.719
Got it, got it, got it,
got it, got it.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.387
Got it.

28:43.431 --> 28:45.347
All right, got it, got it,
got it, got it, got it.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.141
¶¶¶

28:47.184 --> 28:51.687
CRISTELA: Wow! They used up two
whole minutes getting disguised.

28:51.731 --> 28:55.315
¶¶¶

28:55.359 --> 28:57.735
Wait. Wait.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.111
CRISTELA:
Tom, your loincloth fell off.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.779
You have to be fully dressed.

29:00.823 --> 29:01.613
-What? Where did the--
-MAN: Loincloth!

29:01.657 --> 29:03.198
It's on.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.992
What? Oh, it fell off?
Can I keep going?

29:05.035 --> 29:07.161
CRISTELA:
No! You both have to be dressed!

29:07.204 --> 29:11.081
It's like these guys have never
worn loincloths before. What?

29:11.125 --> 29:13.083
They have 35 seconds
to cut up the lord

29:13.127 --> 29:14.835
and throw the body parts
through the hoop,

29:14.879 --> 29:16.754
or we have a tie.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.213
We're at 30 seconds.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.175
¶¶¶

29:21.218 --> 29:23.385
Wow, they're definitely
making up some time.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.636
Let's see if they
can make a run.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.388
Go, go.

29:26.432 --> 29:31.685
CRISTELA: Travis is like 6'10",
but can he hit free throws?

29:31.729 --> 29:33.228
Bring! Bring it!

29:33.272 --> 29:34.730
-Bring! Bring!
-Come on!

29:34.774 --> 29:36.774
CRISTELA:
Oh, that's one! Eight more.

29:36.817 --> 29:40.152
10...9...8...7...

29:40.196 --> 29:43.197
6...5...4...

29:43.240 --> 29:46.825
3...2...1! Oh, no!

29:46.869 --> 29:49.620
The Purple Parrots
did not make it on time.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.830
That means the Red Jaguars
win the Pendant of Life.

29:51.874 --> 29:54.166
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

29:54.210 --> 29:56.668
Ooh! We're going
into a tiebreaker situation.

29:56.712 --> 29:57.878
[laughs]

29:57.922 --> 29:58.837
-Whoo!
-We're back!

29:58.881 --> 30:00.047
BOTH: We're back!

30:00.090 --> 30:02.007
-Ow!
-[laughs]

30:02.051 --> 30:03.634
-Oh!
-Let's go.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.136
I see that Jaguar swagger
right there.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.388
-Yes.
-Like, we doing this.

30:08.432 --> 30:12.142
So that means the Red Jaguars
won a Pendant of Life.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.894
-Oh!
-[cheering and laughing]

30:13.938 --> 30:16.313
Now, though,
we're at a tied game--

30:16.357 --> 30:18.816
one Pendant of Life each.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.651
It all comes down
to this one question

30:20.694 --> 30:22.611
about the Hero Twins.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.905
Whoever gets this question right

30:24.949 --> 30:27.157
wins the second Pendant of Life
and the right to enter

30:27.201 --> 30:32.621
Olmec's temple for a chance
to win $25,000.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.039
Who knows what the question
may be?

30:34.083 --> 30:36.792
So pretty much, everything
is in the hands of Olmec.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.586
Olmec? What's the question?

30:39.630 --> 30:41.004
¶¶¶

30:41.048 --> 30:45.092
Who previously failed
the first three tests

30:45.135 --> 30:47.010
the Hero Twins did?

30:47.054 --> 30:49.221
¶¶¶

30:49.265 --> 30:52.474
Purple Parrots.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.101
Their father, Hunahpu.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.644
¶¶¶

30:55.688 --> 30:57.020
That is correct.

30:57.064 --> 31:01.775
Oh! Purple Parrots.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.527
You get
these two Pendants of Life

31:03.571 --> 31:05.988
and will be moving on
to the Temple Run.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.366
Now that we've gotten everybody
out of the way, you know,

31:09.410 --> 31:10.993
we're gonna kick the crap
out of the temple.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.204
Red Jaguars,
thank you so much for playing.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.998
And you're not going away
empty-handed.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.833
<i> ANNOUNCER: You've won</i>
<i> an electric scooter from Razor</i>

31:17.877 --> 31:20.252
<i> for each of you.</i>
-Thank you.

31:20.296 --> 31:23.171
<i> It's the EcoSmart SUP</i>
<i> electric scooter,</i>

31:23.215 --> 31:25.674
<i> A quiet ride</i>
<i> with a wide bamboo deck,</i>

31:25.718 --> 31:28.594
<i> twist-grip throttle,</i>
<i> and pneumatic tire tubes.</i>

31:28.637 --> 31:31.013
<i> Goes up to 12 miles</i>
<i> on a single charge.</i>

31:31.056 --> 31:33.515
Our time here on "Legends"
has definitely been relatable

31:33.559 --> 31:34.892
to a journey in life.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.768
There's always room
for improvement,

31:36.812 --> 31:39.688
and there's always room
for growth.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.690
No.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.567
When we come back,
the Purple Parrots

31:43.611 --> 31:45.235
get a chance to run
Olmec's temple to retrieve

31:45.279 --> 31:48.822
the Lucky Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
of the Hero Twins

31:48.866 --> 31:51.867
and a chance at $25,000.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.702
You don't wanna miss this.

31:53.746 --> 31:57.915
¶¶¶

32:00.294 --> 32:03.754
Welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

32:03.797 --> 32:05.547
Here with me,
we got Travis and Tom,

32:05.591 --> 32:06.882
the Purple Parrots.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.800
They have proven themselves
worthy

32:08.844 --> 32:11.511
and will be allowed
to enter Olmec's temple.

32:11.555 --> 32:12.763
Feeling strong.

32:12.806 --> 32:13.847
Super pumped.
Ready for the temple.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.182
Ready to run it.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.101
Before we let them loose
to retrieve

32:18.145 --> 32:21.271
the Lucky Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
of the Hero Twins,

32:21.315 --> 32:24.858
Olmec,
tell us how the story ends.

32:24.902 --> 32:28.946
The Hero Twins' mission is
to avenge their father's murder

32:28.989 --> 32:33.325
by ridding the world
of One Death and Seven Death.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.577
With the evil lords slashed
into tiny pieces

32:35.621 --> 32:38.455
and scattered on the ground,

32:38.499 --> 32:40.749
the boys refuse to use
their magic

32:40.793 --> 32:42.793
to put them back together,

32:42.836 --> 32:46.922
leaving them to die
a miserable death.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.799
Mission accomplished,

32:48.842 --> 32:53.720
but the Hero Twins have one
last magic act to perform.

32:53.764 --> 32:58.183
On their way home, they stop
to visit the Magic Fruit Tree,

32:58.227 --> 32:59.893
where this story began.

32:59.937 --> 33:04.648
In one final gesture,
with peace in their hearts,

33:04.692 --> 33:08.777
they bring their father Hunahpu
back to life.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.404
I love that ending. [laughs]

33:10.447 --> 33:13.365
-We're both dads to sons...
-Mm-hmm.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.201
So I mean, I would hope that
my son would avenge my death

33:16.245 --> 33:17.786
in any way necessary.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.163
Olmec, where is the Lucky Ball?

33:20.207 --> 33:22.165
The Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
of the Hero Twins

33:22.209 --> 33:27.546
may be found in...

33:27.589 --> 33:29.131
CRISTELA: There are many
challenges and locked doors

33:29.174 --> 33:30.465
in Olmec's temple that stand

33:30.509 --> 33:32.968
between you
and the Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.262
So before Olmec opens his gate,

33:35.305 --> 33:36.888
he's going to give you
some information

33:36.932 --> 33:40.142
that'll help you make your way
through the temple. Olmec?

33:40.185 --> 33:42.894
Find your way to the Dark Forest

33:42.938 --> 33:46.273
by entering the crystal cenote,
where only one

33:46.316 --> 33:48.108
of the three doors opens.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.985
Choose the low door,

33:50.029 --> 33:53.864
and you could enter the...

33:53.907 --> 33:55.240
Reach into the rotting corpses

33:55.284 --> 33:58.910
until you find
the beating heart.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.121
Place the bloody organ
into the chamber

34:01.165 --> 34:05.459
to open the door
to the Pit of Despair,

34:05.502 --> 34:08.462
where one of three doors
will open.

34:08.505 --> 34:13.175
You could climb the bony walls
and enter...

34:13.218 --> 34:16.053
Avoid the deadly spiders
as you look for one

34:16.096 --> 34:21.767
of two open doors
that may lead you to...

34:21.810 --> 34:24.227
Release your rage
on those clay pots

34:24.271 --> 34:27.731
to find three jade keys
for the king's copper

34:27.775 --> 34:33.236
to unlock the door to...

34:33.280 --> 34:35.572
Maneuver the ancient skull
through the maze,

34:35.616 --> 34:37.616
reuniting it
with its skeleton

34:37.659 --> 34:42.871
to gain entrance to...

34:42.915 --> 34:44.414
Assemble the statue,

34:44.458 --> 34:48.460
and you could open
the gate to...

34:48.504 --> 34:52.089
Remove the rods to drop refuse
on the floor.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.217
In the trash
is the lost jade stone.

34:55.260 --> 35:00.430
Return it to its pedestal
to open the door to...

35:00.474 --> 35:03.183
Dress the queen for battle
in magic armor,

35:03.227 --> 35:08.063
and she may allow you to climb
down the Ladder of Death

35:08.107 --> 35:10.565
into the...

35:10.609 --> 35:15.070
You'll finally grab the Lucky
Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.280
All of the doors
will instantly unlock,

35:17.324 --> 35:20.117
and the temple guards
will vanish.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.828
Race back
through the crystal cenote

35:22.871 --> 35:26.248
and through the temple gates
before time runs out.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.876
The choices are yours
and yours alone.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.295
Who is going first?

35:32.339 --> 35:34.172
I am.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.342
Very well, Travis.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.593
I want Travis to go first

35:38.637 --> 35:39.928
because he's gonna have
the reach.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.513
He's gonna have the strength.

35:41.557 --> 35:45.183
When Cristela gives the signal,
race through the gates

35:45.227 --> 35:50.105
and make your way towards the
Lucky Losing Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

35:50.149 --> 35:53.024
But beware of
the dreaded temple guards

35:53.068 --> 35:56.486
assigned to protect
three specific rules.

35:56.530 --> 36:00.365
Get caught,
and you may trade your pendant

36:00.409 --> 36:03.743
for an extra life and go on,
but get caught a second time,

36:03.787 --> 36:06.580
you will be without a pendant,

36:06.623 --> 36:10.876
and it will be Tom's turn
to enter and try his luck.

36:10.919 --> 36:15.714
Return through the gates
with the ball in four minutes,

36:15.757 --> 36:17.883
and you will both be
handsomely rewarded,

36:17.926 --> 36:20.594
and here's how.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.304
<i> ANNOUNCER: Just for getting</i>

¶¶¶

36:53.337 --> 36:56.213
Whoo! I love that.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.631
Travis, are you ready?

36:57.674 --> 36:59.507
Uh, for 25 grand,
I'm ready for anything, yes.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.676
[laughs]

37:01.720 --> 37:03.345
4 minutes on the clock.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.765
Olmec, open your gate.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.060
Mm.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.603
All right.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.897
Travis...on your mark...

37:13.941 --> 37:15.941
get set...

37:15.984 --> 37:17.817
go!

37:17.861 --> 37:20.362
Come on, Travis. You got this,
you got this, you got this!

37:20.405 --> 37:22.113
Come on!

37:22.157 --> 37:25.742
Into the crystal cenote,
try the bottom door.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.160
Oh! He's in
the Crypt of the Heartless.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.746
-[growls]
-Oh, no, temple guard!

37:29.790 --> 37:31.331
¶¶¶

37:31.375 --> 37:33.959
Each teammate has one pendant,

37:34.002 --> 37:35.961
so the next temple guard
takes him out of the temple.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.004
¶¶¶

37:38.048 --> 37:40.757
Oh, one of those skeletons
has a beating heart

37:40.801 --> 37:42.592
Travis has to find.

37:42.636 --> 37:45.428
¶¶¶

37:45.472 --> 37:47.305
Aah!

37:51.520 --> 37:52.727
There's a door
from the Pit of Despair

37:52.771 --> 37:54.813
right into the Dark Forest.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.648
But it's locked.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.858
¶¶¶

37:58.902 --> 38:01.027
He has to climb up, go all
the way around and back down

38:01.071 --> 38:02.529
to get there.

38:02.572 --> 38:06.074
Oh, man. He's got to go
to the Spider Lair.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.117
All right,
Travis, you're doing this.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.160
Great job, great job.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.747
Yes. Awesome!

38:12.791 --> 38:14.040
Spider Lair.
Let's see where you end up.

38:14.084 --> 38:18.128
Come on, go ahead.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.462
Travis, you got
3 minutes left!

38:19.506 --> 38:22.090
Yes, yes!
That's right, you're coming up!

38:24.303 --> 38:26.011
Travis is
in the Room of the Beloved.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.762
He has to get the skull

38:27.806 --> 38:29.848
connected to the body
at the bottom.

38:29.891 --> 38:32.559
-Move that skull.
-You got this. Yes!

38:32.602 --> 38:35.478
All right, come on. This is
really, like, death metal

38:35.522 --> 38:38.773
with no metal. Come on!
We got this.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.525
Oh! Oh!

38:40.569 --> 38:42.444
Nice, nice!
Keep it going, Travis!

38:42.487 --> 38:44.195
You're doing great,
you're doing great.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.989
Travis is in
the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.

38:46.033 --> 38:47.157
He needs to build it.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.701
-Travis, look out!
-[yells]

38:49.745 --> 38:50.952
No!

38:55.125 --> 38:58.752
¶¶¶

38:58.795 --> 39:00.712
CRISTELA: Travis is in
his sixth room of the temple,

39:00.756 --> 39:03.340
and he only has 2 minutes
and 30 seconds left.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.842
-[yells]
-Aah!

39:05.886 --> 39:08.386
Aah! Go, go, get it!

39:08.430 --> 39:10.180
Tom, you're in!

39:10.223 --> 39:12.307
Tom has just over 2 minutes
to get to the Dark Forest

39:12.351 --> 39:15.935
to grab the Pok-Ta-Pok Ball
for $10,000.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.773
Oh! He's climbing his way up.
Go! Go, go!

39:19.816 --> 39:22.067
¶¶¶

39:22.110 --> 39:24.027
Oh, he's heading towards
the Spider's Lair.

39:24.071 --> 39:26.738
You got this all day.

39:26.782 --> 39:30.367
Remember, you're going to
the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.243
Whoo! Yes!

39:32.287 --> 39:33.620
Oh, he's running past
the Room of the Beloved

39:33.663 --> 39:36.206
that Travis solved earlier.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.625
He's now entering into
the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.795
He needs to put the three pieces
together to build it.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.463
Oh, look at you putting
that Silver Monkey

39:43.507 --> 39:45.590
like it's no one's business! Oh!

39:49.054 --> 39:51.554
You're in
the Room of the Lost Treasure.

39:51.598 --> 39:54.099
You're just two rooms away
from the Dark Forest

39:54.142 --> 39:55.850
and the Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.937
You need to remove the rods,

39:58.980 --> 40:02.399
find the jade stone,
and place it on the pedestal.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.900
No, no, all right,
keep doing it.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.654
It's in there, it's in there.

40:07.697 --> 40:08.863
Remember,
just look for the jade.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.657
Do it.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.118
Travis, let's cheer him on, man.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.286
Ugh! Where's that jade stone?

40:15.330 --> 40:17.372
¶¶¶

40:17.416 --> 40:18.498
The jade stone could be
anywhere.

40:18.542 --> 40:22.710
Look through the pile!

40:22.754 --> 40:24.379
Where is it?

40:24.423 --> 40:26.881
It's right there on his left!

40:26.925 --> 40:28.425
It's right there on his left!

40:28.468 --> 40:29.968
It's on your left,
it's on your left!

40:30.011 --> 40:32.512
All right, come on, Tom!
You got it. Yes, yes, yes!

40:32.556 --> 40:33.805
-Oh! There it is! There it is!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

40:33.849 --> 40:35.306
He's in the Queen's Armory.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.225
He needs to grab
the five pieces of battle armor.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.893
Oh, no! Temple guard!

40:38.937 --> 40:42.063
¶¶¶

40:42.107 --> 40:43.481
All the temple guards are gone.

40:43.525 --> 40:44.691
¶¶¶

40:44.734 --> 40:46.651
You can do this. Come on, Tom.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.027
You got this, you got this.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.822
He has 10 seconds left.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.991
He's one room away
from the Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.159
-Oh, yes. That's what--Yes.
-Yes, yes, yes, go, go, go.

40:54.202 --> 40:54.993
Yes. Good.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.369
Aah!

40:56.413 --> 40:59.956
Go. 3...2...1.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.375
BOTH: No!

41:02.419 --> 41:03.835
You got all the way
to the Queen's Armory,

41:03.879 --> 41:06.463
just one room away
from the Pok-Ta-Pok Ball.

41:06.506 --> 41:07.755
That $10,000 was in your grasp.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.884
You should be proud
of yourselves.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.178
Anger, animosity for sure

41:13.221 --> 41:15.555
will fuel a death metal song.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.223
But you live, you learn.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.433
You take a lesson
for the next time,

41:18.477 --> 41:21.060
and then go ahead
and carry on your day.

41:21.104 --> 41:23.605
CRISTELA: You did prove worthy
of entering Olmec's temple.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.815
You were second to conquer
the moat.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.692
You blazed down
the Steps of Knowledge

41:27.736 --> 41:29.611
and won the tiebreaker
in the Temple Games,

41:29.654 --> 41:33.031
and now you're leaving here
with $2,500,

41:33.074 --> 41:37.785
knowing that you're the most
hardcore metal dads ever.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.498
BOTH: [deep, gravely voices]
Purple Parrots forever.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.249
I'm Cristela Alonzo.

41:43.293 --> 41:45.710
Join us next time for more
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

41:45.754 --> 41:48.630
Hey, Olmec, you ready
to get outta here?

41:48.673 --> 41:52.467
Oh, yes. Just give me a minute
to chisel my face off.

41:52.511 --> 41:55.678
[Cristela laughs and claps]

41:55.722 --> 41:57.096
¶¶¶

41:57.140 --> 42:26.542
[bird cawing in distance]
