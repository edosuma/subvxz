00:53.485 --> 00:54.435
Sarah?

00:55.045 --> 00:56.045
Yes, papa?

00:57.045 --> 00:58.763
I must say
it was a real surprise

00:58.765 --> 01:00.365
when you pulled up this morning.

01:01.154 --> 01:01.985
I know!

01:01.987 --> 01:03.338
I just hadn't seen you in a while.

01:04.584 --> 01:05.803
It was a pleasant surprise.

01:05.805 --> 01:06.793
Don't misunderstand me.

01:06.795 --> 01:08.395
I'm always glad to see you, hon.

01:09.222 --> 01:10.972
Well I hope we get to go fishing.

01:11.174 --> 01:12.828
Oh, yeah.

01:13.635 --> 01:14.713
I was thinking about you

01:14.715 --> 01:17.328
when I was at the cabin the other day.

01:18.085 --> 01:18.918
Yep.

01:20.045 --> 01:23.138
You know, I, I was
walking out on the dock.

01:24.255 --> 01:25.555
It needed a little repair.

01:26.455 --> 01:29.543
But I was thinking about
that time that, uh,

01:29.545 --> 01:32.613
you were out there with your
friends, your little band

01:32.615 --> 01:34.665
and you were showing them about the boat,

01:34.735 --> 01:36.490
and you didn't get it tied up good,

01:36.492 --> 01:38.898
and you stepped up, it
started to get away.

01:39.305 --> 01:40.205
You remember that?

01:41.119 --> 01:44.105
And little Benny, he bent
over to grab the boat

01:44.135 --> 01:46.085
and split his pants wide open.

01:48.736 --> 01:51.379
Heck, you girls were
giggling and laughing...

02:03.935 --> 02:04.768
Ah!

02:13.295 --> 02:15.775
He went running up to the cabin.

02:15.777 --> 02:17.277
You remember that?

02:19.505 --> 02:20.898
Sarah, honey?

02:21.195 --> 02:22.095
Are you all right?

02:23.035 --> 02:24.108
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.678
Can I help you?

02:26.995 --> 02:28.045
No, another minute.

02:29.128 --> 02:32.773
Okay.

02:32.775 --> 02:34.685
You know, I'm sorry you

02:34.789 --> 02:36.689
and Beth are having that trouble but...

02:37.785 --> 02:39.108
She's so stubborn.

02:41.199 --> 02:43.310
That's the thing, you know.

02:43.312 --> 02:45.663
There's good times and
there's bad times, you know.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.493
Your mother and I had some rough times.

02:49.495 --> 02:51.402
But think of all the good ones we had.

02:52.585 --> 02:54.448
Yeah, mama.

02:56.395 --> 02:59.318
I just, I mean, I never
wanted to have kids.

02:59.376 --> 03:00.364
- I know.
- You know that.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.300
I know, I know.

03:02.302 --> 03:04.583
Oh good God, breakfast!

03:04.585 --> 03:05.585
Oh, oh no.

03:08.129 --> 03:10.296
Ah, oh goodness.

03:10.841 --> 03:12.459
Oh, watch,
coming around, coming around.

03:12.461 --> 03:13.713
I think I can save these eggs.

03:13.715 --> 03:14.783
Okay, I got it.

03:14.785 --> 03:16.498
Looks just about done too.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.760
I think these eggs are
salvageable actually.

03:18.762 --> 03:20.666
Pretty good, huh?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.188
Well the bacon looks good.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.426
Okay.

03:23.821 --> 03:25.529
Oh man, I'm gonna have to clean this up.

03:25.531 --> 03:26.531
It's a mess.

03:26.675 --> 03:27.725
Can I use this can?

03:27.825 --> 03:29.191
Oh sure, honey.

03:29.193 --> 03:30.860
All right.

03:32.022 --> 03:33.258
Almost ready.

03:39.508 --> 03:41.548
You wanna get the bacon
and put it on the...

03:51.054 --> 03:51.887
Sarah?

03:53.027 --> 03:55.281
Sweetie, what's wrong Sarah?

03:55.283 --> 03:56.114
Sarah?

03:56.116 --> 03:56.949
Oh god!

03:57.528 --> 03:58.361
Oh god!

03:59.786 --> 04:00.619
Oh god!

04:01.706 --> 04:02.944
What's wrong with you?

04:02.946 --> 04:04.113
Are you crazy?

04:05.808 --> 04:06.641
Jesus, ow!

04:51.804 --> 04:52.637
What?

04:57.539 --> 04:59.036
We gotta fix this.

04:59.038 --> 05:00.955
I gotta fix it, fix it.

05:01.276 --> 05:02.236
Gotta fix it.

05:02.238 --> 05:03.069
Gotta fix it.

05:16.404 --> 05:17.293
Gotta fix it.

05:17.295 --> 05:19.443
I just gotta fix it, clean it up,

05:19.445 --> 05:20.602
clean this up.

05:20.604 --> 05:22.021
I'll clean it up.

05:22.775 --> 05:23.773
I'll clean it up.

05:23.775 --> 05:24.915
I have to fix it.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.533
I have to fix the puzzle.

05:36.535 --> 05:38.202
I'll fix the puzzle.

05:38.557 --> 05:41.485
Got the edge, I got the
frame of the puzzle started.

05:41.487 --> 05:46.487
So I'll just fix the puzzle.

05:56.265 --> 05:57.811
I just killed my father.

05:57.813 --> 05:59.396
I killed my father.

06:00.737 --> 06:01.820
I killed him.

06:02.706 --> 06:04.206
Why did I do that?

06:09.786 --> 06:10.786
I fixed him.

06:11.466 --> 06:14.572
He's always trying to fix everything.

06:14.574 --> 06:15.593
I'll get him fixed.

06:15.595 --> 06:16.728
I fixed him.

06:16.905 --> 06:18.673
I fixed him myself.

06:18.675 --> 06:20.018
The last fixer.

06:20.145 --> 06:21.628
The last fix.

06:23.872 --> 06:24.772
And you know what?

06:24.815 --> 06:26.398
You know what else?

06:28.195 --> 06:29.828
He tried to fix you too.

06:31.314 --> 06:32.752
I don't need fixing.

06:34.252 --> 06:35.419
You fixed him.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.160
It smells really good in here.

09:12.162 --> 09:14.218
Oh god, I love the
smell of fresh coffee.

09:14.895 --> 09:15.726
This looks amazing.

09:15.728 --> 09:16.561
It does.

09:17.385 --> 09:19.123
Hey, can you order me a black coffee?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.375
I gotta use the bathroom.

09:23.865 --> 09:24.696
Oh, excuse me.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.529
I'm sorry.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.753
Oh no, that was my fault,
I didn't see you, I'm sorry.

09:27.755 --> 09:28.748
It's okay.

09:33.475 --> 09:35.413
You don't look like
you're from around here.

09:35.415 --> 09:36.248
I'm not.

09:36.395 --> 09:37.226
We're not.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.008
Just here for a weekend getaway.

09:39.455 --> 09:40.286
That sounds like fun,

09:40.288 --> 09:42.145
camping in the mountains kind of a thing.

09:42.425 --> 09:43.275
How'd you know?

09:43.565 --> 09:45.000
It's the only thing
really to do around here

09:45.002 --> 09:46.100
this time of year.

09:46.102 --> 09:46.933
Right.

09:46.935 --> 09:47.766
Yeah, we're from the city

09:47.768 --> 09:49.858
so this'll be a nice
change of pace for us.

09:50.145 --> 09:51.648
You keep saying us.

09:52.245 --> 09:54.145
Oh, uh, my friends and my boyfriend.

09:55.805 --> 09:56.638
Next in line.

09:57.005 --> 09:58.150
That would be you.

09:58.152 --> 09:58.983
Thanks.

09:58.985 --> 10:01.926
Can I get coffee and...

10:01.928 --> 10:04.038
This one's on me, whatever she wants.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.808
You really don't have to do that.

10:05.810 --> 10:07.723
No really, I'd like
to, come on, no problem.

10:07.725 --> 10:08.669
You really don't.

10:08.671 --> 10:09.502
I have to get my boyfriend a coffee.

10:09.504 --> 10:10.743
Come on, it's the least I can do

10:10.745 --> 10:12.206
for knocking into you like that.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.178
It's on me.

10:14.425 --> 10:17.193
Can I get an iced green tea

10:17.195 --> 10:18.866
and a black coffee for him, please?

10:18.868 --> 10:19.868
All right.

10:20.645 --> 10:23.578
One green tea and?

10:24.425 --> 10:25.725
I'll have a double shot.

10:26.381 --> 10:28.238
One Double shot.

10:28.285 --> 10:29.218
That'll be $8.45.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.008
10 and 11.

10:35.215 --> 10:36.048
Thank you, baby.

10:36.339 --> 10:37.200
Thank you.

10:37.202 --> 10:38.558
Mm-hm, thank you.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.283
Thanks again.

10:40.285 --> 10:41.116
You really didn't have to do that.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.095
No problem really.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.163
So is this your first
time up to the mountains?

10:48.165 --> 10:50.853
Yep, we rented this cute
little cabin up in the woods.

10:50.855 --> 10:52.408
Nice peace and quiet for us.

10:52.921 --> 10:57.254
You've certainly come to
the right place for that.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.985
We've got a
green tea for the lady here

11:02.005 --> 11:03.608
and a double shot.

11:03.825 --> 11:04.775
Any sugar, honey?

11:05.385 --> 11:06.335
Um, honey please.

11:06.445 --> 11:07.593
Honey, huh.

11:07.595 --> 11:08.428
Health nut.

11:16.795 --> 11:17.745
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.108
All set?

11:20.635 --> 11:23.223

attractive woman's other half.

Enjoy your evening.

11:41.175 --> 11:42.395
What was that about?

11:42.734 --> 11:43.636
I don't know.

11:43.638 --> 11:46.483
Bumped into me in line and
bought our drinks as an apology.

11:46.485 --> 11:47.316
He brought our drinks?

11:47.318 --> 11:48.758
Why didn't you get a quiche or something?

11:50.515 --> 11:51.532

Hi!

12:04.685 --> 12:06.422
It's cold as shit outside.

12:06.755 --> 12:07.772
We'll be drunk in no time.

12:13.175 --> 12:14.525

13:40.274 --> 13:41.274
Thank you.

13:41.664 --> 13:42.664
Here we are!

13:45.130 --> 13:45.961
- Yeah?
- Alright.

13:45.963 --> 13:47.888
- It's awesome.
- It's really warm.

13:48.115 --> 13:48.948
That'll work.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.398
Is all the artwork crocheted?

13:50.479 --> 13:52.046
Uh, yes.

13:52.048 --> 13:52.965
Yes, it is.

13:56.838 --> 13:58.118
There's something bad in this house.

13:59.281 --> 14:00.112
What, that smell?

14:00.114 --> 14:00.945
Yeah.

14:02.226 --> 14:03.767
I'm sure this bag is full of some weird...

14:03.769 --> 14:05.088
Oh let's not hate on this house.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.340
That's pretty unfair, okay.

14:09.608 --> 14:10.740
You all right, babe?

14:12.500 --> 14:13.331
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.622
Uh, where's your ,

14:15.916 --> 14:16.813

14:16.815 --> 14:18.365
It's to the right over there.

14:18.923 --> 14:20.123
Water?

14:22.460 --> 14:23.433
I hope she's okay.

14:24.411 --> 14:25.734
Alright, what you got?

14:25.736 --> 14:27.113
Well this has got to be TJ's bag,

14:27.115 --> 14:28.298
it's just all booze.

14:29.047 --> 14:30.892
Yeah, all I did was
bring the essentials, yes,

14:30.894 --> 14:31.725
that's all I did.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.548
- Okay.
- Okay, what is this?

14:44.752 --> 14:46.103
- Broccoli.
- Raw broccoli?

14:46.105 --> 14:47.645
2018, who eats that?

15:03.106 --> 15:05.442
Thank, limes, tequila, right, thank you.

15:05.444 --> 15:06.275
That means a lot to me.

15:06.277 --> 15:07.923
It's not for tequila,
it's for the hummus.

15:07.925 --> 15:09.776
Gotta mix in the hummus.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.611
That's a waste of...

15:33.041 --> 15:35.355
Vikki, you okay in there?

15:35.357 --> 15:36.774
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:37.523 --> 15:39.273
I just need a minute.

16:20.735 --> 16:22.177
TJ, can you help me?

16:22.179 --> 16:23.179
With what?

16:24.429 --> 16:26.179
Can you cut up this onion please?

16:26.785 --> 16:29.248
Oh, no can do honey buns.

16:29.705 --> 16:30.538
Excuse me.

16:30.895 --> 16:32.273
I'm actually allergic to onions.

16:32.275 --> 16:33.873
Every time I cut one, my eyes get watery

16:33.875 --> 16:35.118
and the heat gets back.

16:36.008 --> 16:37.013
You are such a dick you know that?

16:37.015 --> 16:39.143
Well, this was suppose
to be a fun party weekend.

16:39.145 --> 16:40.003
I don't want to start it off

16:40.005 --> 16:41.783
by crying like a little
girl in summer camp.

16:41.785 --> 16:44.233
No one every said this
was a fun party weekend TJ.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.753
It's not one of your frat boy parties.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.243
You graduated from
college eight years ago.

16:47.245 --> 16:48.076
- Uh seven.
- Eight.

16:48.078 --> 16:49.138
- Seven.
- Eight!

16:51.555 --> 16:52.865
Here's your eight!

16:53.165 --> 16:55.330
Oh, oh, that's gross, I'm so sorry.

16:55.332 --> 16:56.408
You are such a dick.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.717
- Feeling okay?
- Yeah.

17:07.719 --> 17:09.012
Yeah.

17:09.015 --> 17:12.203
I had to escape Em and TJ.

17:12.204 --> 17:14.583
They out there arguing over hummus.

17:14.585 --> 17:17.465
And I just can't.

17:17.468 --> 17:18.863
TJ's not having it, is he?

17:18.865 --> 17:20.998
He's not, he's all about beer and.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.458
Tequila.

17:22.577 --> 17:24.705
- And tequila.
- I'm sure, yeah.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.655
- I love you.
- I love you more.

17:32.657 --> 17:33.770
It's not a competition.

17:35.258 --> 17:36.802
But if it was, I would win.

17:36.804 --> 17:37.948
- Would you?
- Yeah.

17:37.950 --> 17:38.920
Ah, I don't know about that.

17:38.922 --> 17:39.753
Hmm hmm.

17:39.755 --> 17:40.586
I'll give you a run for your money.

17:40.588 --> 17:41.421
Okay.

17:41.615 --> 17:42.973
Thank you for coming up here this weekend.

17:42.975 --> 17:43.968
Of course.

17:44.495 --> 17:45.723
I know TJ's not your favorite.

17:45.725 --> 17:46.768
He's fine.

17:47.665 --> 17:48.498
In moderation.

17:49.825 --> 17:50.753
Emma's really sweet though.

17:50.755 --> 17:51.698
I like her.

17:51.705 --> 17:53.155
- She's my favorite.
- Yeah.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.376
I don't know, he's
really lucky to have her.

17:56.378 --> 17:58.028
I don't know how he did that.

17:59.749 --> 18:01.166
I have no idea.

18:01.265 --> 18:03.673
I think if we wanted a moment alone,

18:03.675 --> 18:04.513
I think we have it.

18:04.515 --> 18:06.363
They're arguing.

18:06.365 --> 18:07.198
Yeah?

18:08.943 --> 18:10.526
- I don't know.
- No?

18:10.793 --> 18:11.893
- Nmm mmm.
- Why not?

18:12.011 --> 18:13.883
I don't know, they might hear us.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.632
- I'm gonna magic mike you.
- No!

18:16.634 --> 18:17.467
Shh.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.805
- Hmm yeah.
- Don't.

18:21.807 --> 18:22.638
You're so stupid.

18:29.923 --> 18:31.154
You're sure they won't hear us?

18:31.156 --> 18:32.385
I'm telling you they won't.

18:32.387 --> 18:33.304
Mmm, hmm.

18:45.786 --> 18:46.617
- What's wrong?
- Dang it.

18:46.619 --> 18:48.019
Nothing, I'll be right back.

19:03.925 --> 19:06.478
Hey, so where are my cigarettes?

19:06.494 --> 19:07.794
Uh, they're in my purse.

19:08.094 --> 19:11.261
- Thanks.
- No problem, you're welcome.

19:11.705 --> 19:13.205
That looks really tasteless.

19:13.668 --> 19:14.501
It's onions.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.113
They're healthy, you need to be healthy.

19:16.115 --> 19:19.017
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go
outside and be super healthy.

19:19.019 --> 19:19.850
Ah.

19:19.852 --> 19:20.713
Let me know if you need anything.

19:20.715 --> 19:23.409
It's not like you'd be
of any help even if I did.

19:23.411 --> 19:26.424
Love you too.

21:14.334 --> 21:16.693
You all right Vikki?

21:16.695 --> 21:18.112
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:18.727 --> 21:20.604
Well, we're starting the movie soon.

21:23.719 --> 21:25.543
All right, I'll be there in a minute.

21:54.385 --> 21:55.635
You guys about to play?

21:55.675 --> 21:56.508
Yeah.

21:56.695 --> 21:58.068
Look at you, we're next.

21:58.395 --> 22:00.413
All right, uh, how was it?

22:00.415 --> 22:03.268
Do you uh, do some below the belt boxing?

22:05.335 --> 22:07.178
Some mayo-mono-mattress?

22:08.045 --> 22:09.463
Did you tickle her insides?

22:09.465 --> 22:11.603
No, dude, we just made out, okay.

22:11.605 --> 22:13.005
And she started bleeding so.

22:13.205 --> 22:15.760
Oh, all right, well, you know.

22:15.762 --> 22:17.613
Not every guy likes
ketchup on their hotdog.

22:17.615 --> 22:18.658
I understand.

22:18.855 --> 22:20.408
TJ that's disgusting.

22:21.475 --> 22:22.306
You're gonna give him the wrong idea.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.818
She had a nose bleed.

22:24.665 --> 22:25.763
So you like it rough Mikey?

22:25.765 --> 22:27.263
I didn't do that.

22:27.265 --> 22:28.847
- She...
- It's all right.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.203
At least you're not a
pussy like this bitch.

22:30.205 --> 22:34.175
Whoa, you should put her
jacket away pussy bitch.

22:34.177 --> 22:35.527
All right.

22:35.735 --> 22:37.023
It's gonna get gross tonight honey.

22:37.025 --> 22:37.863
Sounds good.

22:37.865 --> 22:40.373
Oh that's way
too much information.

22:40.375 --> 22:41.848
Let's see what you do, come on.

22:53.147 --> 22:54.533
This movie blows.

22:54.535 --> 22:56.183
- You picked it.
- I'm just saying.

22:56.185 --> 22:58.258
I need more guts, I need more gore.

22:58.515 --> 22:59.463
Boobs wouldn't hurt.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.900
Can you just
please watch the movie?

23:00.902 --> 23:01.733
Are you 12/

23:01.735 --> 23:04.115
I'm just saying, it said
nudity on the box, so.

23:04.215 --> 23:05.103
That's why you picked it?

23:05.105 --> 23:06.268
- Yes.
- Yeah.

23:07.545 --> 23:08.833
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, don't do that!

23:08.835 --> 23:10.318
No, no, no, she's dead.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.198
Hey, boobs.

23:16.245 --> 23:17.308
Stupid boobs.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.313
What?

23:19.315 --> 23:21.233
- Damn it TJ!
- Dude, chill out.

23:21.235 --> 23:23.185
The movie's gonna get good now, I hope.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.808
No, take that off your eyes.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.563
She's not even
gonna see it coming.

23:26.565 --> 23:28.622
- He's got her man.
- It's so stupid.

23:28.989 --> 23:29.822
Oh man.

23:30.715 --> 23:32.608
It's like uh, like you and.

23:33.882 --> 23:34.882
Seriously?

23:35.631 --> 23:36.464
I'm sorry.

23:36.533 --> 23:37.366
It slipped.

23:37.385 --> 23:38.216
Dude, really?

23:38.218 --> 23:40.673
Is your douche-baggery
like a coping mechanism

23:40.675 --> 23:42.103
for something or you just,

23:42.105 --> 23:44.105
like did you have a traumatic childhood?

23:44.715 --> 23:46.815
I did have kind of a dick older brother.

23:46.865 --> 23:49.065
- I don't care.
- I'm gonna go cook dinner.

23:49.675 --> 23:51.825
Wait, wait, it just
started getting good.

23:54.925 --> 23:55.758
Really Mike?

23:56.832 --> 23:57.663
What the fuck?

23:57.665 --> 23:58.496
Enjoy your porn.

23:58.498 --> 24:00.483
It's just porn, she's just dirty

24:00.485 --> 24:02.485
so she's taking a bath, yeah, it's porn.

24:39.835 --> 24:40.668
Hey Em.

24:41.135 --> 24:41.966
Hey.

24:41.968 --> 24:42.799
Do you want
some help with dinner?

24:42.801 --> 24:43.632
Please.

24:43.634 --> 24:44.465
Will you help me chop some veggies?

24:44.467 --> 24:45.425
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

24:45.542 --> 24:46.758
Are you feeling better?

24:47.155 --> 24:47.986
You know I am.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.319
I think it was just a
stomach bug or something.

24:50.321 --> 24:52.248
Maybe you just need to eat something.

24:52.715 --> 24:54.033
You know we're here for you right?

24:54.035 --> 24:56.595
- I know, thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:58.555 --> 25:00.036
But, with how you've been feeling,

25:00.038 --> 25:01.453
I don't think that's a good idea

25:01.455 --> 25:03.523
for you to chop veggies
with a sharp knife.

25:03.525 --> 25:05.825
You're gonna watch the
sauce and I'm gonna fix

25:06.235 --> 25:07.335
the rest of the salad.

25:08.593 --> 25:11.598
Ah, this salad's gonna be so, so good.

25:11.915 --> 25:14.111
I should get some meat
for the salad though.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.163
We've got some tomatoes.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.615
We've got some onions and some carrots

25:17.711 --> 25:19.031
and some cucumbers.

25:19.033 --> 25:19.920
Oh it's gonna be good.

25:19.922 --> 25:21.208
Are you excited Vikki?

25:23.305 --> 25:24.138
Vikki?

25:25.165 --> 25:25.998
Vikki?

25:26.185 --> 25:27.018
Yeah.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.173
I'm talking to you
but you're zoning out.

25:29.175 --> 25:31.032
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

25:31.182 --> 25:32.765
Is everything okay?

25:32.893 --> 25:34.143
Yeah, I just.

25:34.422 --> 25:36.748
I feel a little off
since we've been up here.

25:38.015 --> 25:39.465
What are you talking about?

25:39.725 --> 25:42.103
Like earlier, when Mike
and I were in the bedroom.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.795
Ew, sexy time.

25:43.805 --> 25:45.121
Almost sexy time.

25:45.123 --> 25:46.402
Almost sexy time?

25:46.404 --> 25:47.235
I don't know, it's really weird.

25:47.237 --> 25:49.268
I got this bloody nose.

25:49.885 --> 25:52.058
And I went to the bathroom,
I started getting all these,

25:52.805 --> 25:54.348
sharp stomach pains?

25:54.465 --> 25:55.533
Maybe you're pregnant.

25:55.535 --> 25:58.423
No, I'm not pregnant, sorry.

25:58.425 --> 26:00.225
- I was hoping to be an aunt.
- No!

26:00.716 --> 26:01.673
Well, that's okay.

26:01.675 --> 26:03.625
I mean, you'll feel better soon, right?

26:03.715 --> 26:05.168
It's probably something you ate.

26:06.145 --> 26:09.208
But Mike, speaking of pregnancy.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.825
Y'all gotta get married
so when's that happening,

26:12.935 --> 26:14.618
so you can have a little baby.

26:14.665 --> 26:17.133
Well, I can just keep hoping and dreaming

26:17.135 --> 26:18.233
that you're gonna have twins.

26:18.235 --> 26:21.448
And you're gonna name one
Emma after me obviously.

26:21.745 --> 26:23.283
And then you're gonna name one Mike

26:23.285 --> 26:26.250
'cause you've gotta name
one after your baby daddy...

26:36.132 --> 26:37.215
Vikki, Vikki!

26:38.423 --> 26:39.254
Oh shit!

26:39.256 --> 26:42.358
What the fuck?

26:42.899 --> 26:43.730
I don't know.

26:43.732 --> 26:44.595
Are you okay?

26:44.647 --> 26:45.483
What happened, what?

26:45.485 --> 26:46.785
It's just a little burn.

26:46.790 --> 26:47.670
Wait Vic, let me see.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.548
No, I'm fine,
I just need a minute.

26:50.949 --> 26:51.780
What happened?

26:51.782 --> 26:53.165
She burned her hand on the stove.

26:53.505 --> 26:54.336
Like on it, on it.

26:54.338 --> 26:55.608
Yes, on it, on it.

28:07.658 --> 28:09.991
Hey babe, how's your hand?

28:10.068 --> 28:10.946
It's better.

28:10.948 --> 28:12.723
It doesn't hurt that much.

28:12.725 --> 28:13.658
Can I see it?

28:14.530 --> 28:15.793
No.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.248
I just wrapped it and I
don't want to unwrap it.

28:18.788 --> 28:19.621
Hmm.

28:25.925 --> 28:28.663
She was just covered in blood
and now she's like all calm?

28:28.665 --> 28:30.283
No way, I'd be freaking out.

28:30.285 --> 28:31.713
Yeah, I was about to say something.

28:31.715 --> 28:33.523
- It's totally fake.
- Hmm hmm.

28:33.525 --> 28:34.848
Yeah, it's a movie.

28:34.905 --> 28:36.818
Yeah, could be worse though.

28:37.035 --> 28:38.688
- Yeah.
- But still.

28:39.005 --> 28:41.055
If it was me, totally different reaction.

28:41.645 --> 28:42.476
You don't like blood?

28:42.478 --> 28:44.163
No, do you like blood?

28:44.165 --> 28:46.768
I mean, I don't
freak out around it.

28:47.905 --> 28:50.063
If there's a whole
lot, like in front of me,

28:50.065 --> 28:51.015
it's just too much.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.623
You know like the person that like

28:53.625 --> 28:55.948
throws up and adds to the mess.

29:10.377 --> 29:12.173
You're okay, you're okay.

29:12.175 --> 29:13.972
You were just sleeping.

29:14.067 --> 29:14.898
- I was?
- Yeah.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.785
Yeah, you were snoring and everything.

29:17.321 --> 29:18.697
- I did?
- No you didn't.

29:18.699 --> 29:20.499
Yep, a little bit.

29:20.501 --> 29:21.418
You okay?

29:22.050 --> 29:23.467
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:25.969 --> 29:27.719
- Dinner's ready.
- Stop.

29:27.721 --> 29:28.650
- Come up.
- You hungry?

29:28.652 --> 29:30.608
Let's eat this now, slide over.

29:30.995 --> 29:33.222
- Whoa, whoa honey.
- Let's go.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.747
This is pretty insensitive.

29:36.922 --> 29:38.323
Yeah.

29:38.325 --> 29:39.433
Also, please don't sneak up

29:39.435 --> 29:41.148
when I'm watching a horror film.

29:45.359 --> 29:46.282
You are welcome.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.983
Who would like my grass clippings?

29:48.985 --> 29:50.565
- It's salad.
- It is salad.

29:51.624 --> 29:52.455
Please eat your salad, babe.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.288
You've eaten half of your food.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.433
I've eaten the part that matters.

29:54.435 --> 29:56.293
The carbs, the sauce, the chicken.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.963
- I ate everything that...
- Just eat a little bit babe.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.815
There's no chicken in that.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.065
Did you say that there's
no chicken in that?

30:02.067 --> 30:03.698
There's no
chicken, it's vegetarian.

30:03.860 --> 30:04.825
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

30:06.445 --> 30:07.276
Is that how you get
him to eat the veggies?

30:07.278 --> 30:08.866
- Yeah.
- You lie to him?

30:08.868 --> 30:09.743
I isn't lying to you...

30:09.745 --> 30:11.788
My whole world just got
kind of turned upside.

30:12.119 --> 30:14.004
Well, we have to treat you like a child.

30:14.006 --> 30:15.089
- Okay.
- Aww.

30:16.269 --> 30:18.050
Okay, besides picking on TJ,

30:18.052 --> 30:19.368
what else can we do?

30:19.615 --> 30:21.110
Mike, let's talk about you.

30:21.112 --> 30:24.048
- Did you really just...
- Anything, what do you do?

30:24.985 --> 30:27.199
- Uh, I'm accountant.
- You're an accountant.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.032
Hmm hmm.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.368
Oh, so you're good with numbers.

30:30.315 --> 30:31.215
Do you do taxes?

30:31.505 --> 30:32.336
Hmm hmm.

30:32.338 --> 30:33.169
Yes and guess what else

30:33.171 --> 30:34.453
does he do as an accountant.

30:34.455 --> 30:36.753
More than that, but I
will also help your taxes.

30:36.755 --> 30:38.238
Yeah, he may do taxes.

30:38.385 --> 30:39.265
I'm gonna need some help.

30:40.578 --> 30:42.016
I have literally have like five jobs.

30:42.018 --> 30:43.867
And they're taxes are horrible.

30:43.869 --> 30:44.700
What do you do?

30:44.702 --> 30:46.218
One of 'em's a stripper.

30:47.955 --> 30:49.455
Well, without ever touching.

30:50.212 --> 30:51.543
That's pretty
impressive actually.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.376
Yeah, thank you.

30:52.378 --> 30:54.133
And the one I'm most passionate about

30:54.135 --> 30:55.685
is the hardest to do taxes for.

30:56.085 --> 30:58.008
1099, so there's a DJ.

30:58.411 --> 30:59.598
- TJ's The DJ.
- TJ's a DJ.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.183
That's my name, TJ the DJ.

31:02.185 --> 31:03.303
Is it like do you do like bar mitzvah?

31:03.305 --> 31:04.703
- Oh yeah.
- Or do you do the club thing.

31:04.705 --> 31:05.536
Oh yeah.

31:05.538 --> 31:07.248
Like you know, let's
get the party started.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.348
So do you do weddings?

31:18.385 --> 31:19.623
Is it just like wedding DJ

31:19.625 --> 31:21.233
or do you do like wedding singing also?

31:21.235 --> 31:22.893
- Oh, no, no, no, I don't.
- No he does not sing.

31:22.895 --> 31:24.418
- I don't sing.
- No?

31:24.505 --> 31:26.522
I did it one time and I
won't ever do that again.

31:26.524 --> 31:27.355
Oh really?

31:27.357 --> 31:28.188
And we don't talk about that.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.305
- You did it once.
- It was amazing.

31:30.307 --> 31:32.071
- It was so good.
- What did you sing?

31:32.073 --> 31:33.951
- We do not talk about it.
- What'd you sing?

31:33.953 --> 31:35.272
- Emma, what did he sing?
- I talk about it.

31:35.274 --> 31:36.247
- What he sing?
- Don't you do it.

31:36.249 --> 31:38.217
- At last.
- No I did not, I did not.

31:41.740 --> 31:42.893
Mrs. James would have cried.

31:42.895 --> 31:45.066
- Like it was horrible.
- It was really funny.

31:45.068 --> 31:47.488
No, what was crazy,
I met her at a wedding,

31:47.525 --> 31:49.115
the one right before that.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.773
And then I took her to
that wedding as a date

31:50.775 --> 31:53.038
where I got drank and I sang, yeah.

31:53.375 --> 31:54.513
- And she's still here, so.
- I am.

31:54.515 --> 31:56.205
- So you met you at a wedding?
- Yeah.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.428
And this wedding, tell me about it.

31:58.885 --> 31:59.903
I'mma take this one,
I'mma take this one.

31:59.905 --> 32:00.815
- Okay.
- I tell it right.

32:00.817 --> 32:01.718
We'll see what story it is.

32:01.910 --> 32:03.403
- So, this was the...
- Yeah, it changes.

32:03.405 --> 32:06.105
This is the most gorgeous
wedding I've ever been to.

32:06.493 --> 32:07.423
It was really pretty.

32:15.735 --> 32:16.863
So everyone was gorgeous.

32:16.865 --> 32:17.965
Everyone was gorgeous.

32:19.295 --> 32:21.333
She could not stop staring at me.

32:21.335 --> 32:23.349
- That didn't happen.
- The entire.

32:23.351 --> 32:24.746
I mean just like ogling, googling, ogling.

32:24.748 --> 32:28.173
I mean it was like borderline like creepy.

32:28.175 --> 32:30.425
- Like inappropriate almost.
- I'm not creepy.

32:31.525 --> 32:32.545
So, I, I, I...

32:36.081 --> 32:37.281
- I'm not creepy.
- Yeah.

32:39.565 --> 32:42.043
So I queued up just tons of like you know,

32:42.045 --> 32:43.913
sappy 80 songs or whatever and then...

32:43.915 --> 32:46.246
80's, well I don't listen
to 80's, that's awful.

32:47.195 --> 32:48.413
I came up to ask her to dance

32:48.415 --> 32:51.428
and she was talking to the
biggest creep I've ever seen.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.312
- He was not creepy.
- Oh my goodness.

32:53.314 --> 32:54.753
He had a toupee.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.980
A toupee with a comb
over with the long hair...

32:56.982 --> 32:57.836
- No, it wasn't a toupee.
- Aw!

32:57.838 --> 33:00.498
That one strong gust of wind
and it's just all scalp.

33:05.085 --> 33:05.916
Did he have one

33:05.918 --> 33:07.361
of those really creepy like goatees?

33:07.363 --> 33:09.629
Uh!

33:09.631 --> 33:10.993
That was below the belt.

33:13.095 --> 33:14.825
So moving past that

33:14.885 --> 33:16.808
I rescued her from this creep.

33:17.082 --> 33:17.913
- And I wanted to...
- Rescued?

33:17.915 --> 33:18.858
Yes, yes.

33:19.095 --> 33:21.208
I do not need to be rescued.

33:21.476 --> 33:22.307
Women don't need to be rescued.

33:22.309 --> 33:23.724
No, women do not need to be rescued.

33:23.726 --> 33:24.557
Me and the kid, don't
need to be rescued.

33:24.559 --> 33:26.318
In that situation, you needed to be.

33:38.372 --> 33:39.205
Vikki!

33:42.331 --> 33:43.524
Earth to Vikki.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.082
Baby, your arm is, what?

34:00.522 --> 34:01.355
Oh fuck!

34:03.587 --> 34:04.418
Oh!

34:29.527 --> 34:30.360
Oh my God.

34:37.420 --> 34:38.253
Vikki?

34:40.166 --> 34:40.998
Vikki?

35:02.415 --> 35:03.248
Vik.

35:32.471 --> 35:34.388
What's wrong with me?

35:46.963 --> 35:48.713
It's okay, come on.

36:15.605 --> 36:18.121
I know she's your friend,
but what the hell was that?

36:18.123 --> 36:20.153
I don't know what that was.

36:20.155 --> 36:21.285
Vikki is uh...

36:23.465 --> 36:24.668
Did you see her arm?

36:26.845 --> 36:27.678
Is she okay?

36:27.848 --> 36:29.931
Should I, I don't know.

36:29.965 --> 36:30.798
I think she's.

36:32.135 --> 36:34.345
I don't know, she's in the shower.

36:34.347 --> 36:35.648
I need to talk to her.

36:36.705 --> 36:37.538
Yeah.

37:00.166 --> 37:03.683
Vikki can I come in?

37:07.036 --> 37:08.750
Vikki, how are you feeling?

37:08.752 --> 37:10.085
Hmm, I'm fine.

37:12.372 --> 37:14.008
You wanna tell me what's going on?

37:17.055 --> 37:17.888
Vikki?

37:18.880 --> 37:20.030
I said I'm fine Emma.

37:20.335 --> 37:21.548
You're not fine.

37:22.205 --> 37:24.013
What happened at dinner was not fine.

37:24.015 --> 37:25.815
That's more than just a stomach bug.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.448
So how about you tell me
what's actually going on?

37:32.431 --> 37:33.264
Can I please see your arm?

37:33.588 --> 37:34.978
No.

37:34.980 --> 37:36.207
Vikki, just let me see your arm?

37:36.209 --> 37:37.209
I said no.

37:39.865 --> 37:40.698
Okay.

37:43.475 --> 37:44.433
Are you sure you don't want me to take you

37:44.435 --> 37:45.885
to the hospital or something?

37:47.281 --> 37:48.681
I don't need the hospital.

37:48.705 --> 37:50.053
Vikki, please let me take you.

37:50.055 --> 37:52.598
I said I don't need to
go to the hospital, Emma!

37:54.345 --> 37:55.178
Fine.

37:57.925 --> 37:59.833
Just let me know if
you need anything okay?

37:59.835 --> 38:00.768
Just leave.

38:03.270 --> 38:04.103
Fine.

38:37.745 --> 38:38.578
How was she?

38:38.675 --> 38:39.508
Not good.

38:41.077 --> 38:42.277
She wouldn't talk to me.

38:42.475 --> 38:43.658
She wouldn't let me see it.

38:45.386 --> 38:47.228
I think there's something wrong with her.

38:48.506 --> 38:50.018
I need to take her to the hospital.

38:54.045 --> 38:56.428
Look it's been a long day.

38:57.295 --> 38:58.218
And it's late.

38:59.065 --> 39:00.268
These roads are dark.

39:01.334 --> 39:02.853
We've got no cellphone reception

39:02.855 --> 39:04.268
which means no GPS.

39:05.215 --> 39:06.763
I don't even know how to
get to the nearest hospital.

39:06.765 --> 39:07.598
Do you?

39:08.986 --> 39:09.819
I mean,

39:12.948 --> 39:15.018
Vikki's the strongest person I know.

39:16.805 --> 39:19.038
If she's already wrapped up and bandaged,

39:21.215 --> 39:22.565
I'm too scared to move her.

39:23.915 --> 39:26.308
So let's just wait till morning.

39:28.535 --> 39:31.285
Once it's light out, we can
find our way to a hospital.

39:33.323 --> 39:37.275
I mean, it might not be as
bad as it looked, right?

39:38.375 --> 39:41.198
No offense, it could be
a lot worse than it looks.

39:47.015 --> 39:47.848
Okay fine.

39:50.032 --> 39:51.053
But if she's not better in the morning,

39:51.055 --> 39:52.705
we're taking her to the hospital.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.308
Deal?

39:57.415 --> 39:58.248
Deal?

40:00.545 --> 40:01.378
Yeah.

40:02.410 --> 40:03.577
Okay.

40:14.185 --> 40:16.135
This looks so fun, we should do that.

40:17.435 --> 40:18.603
Today was so freaky.

40:18.605 --> 40:22.008
It was like the red wedding but a dinner.

40:22.515 --> 40:23.515
With the red dinner.

40:23.740 --> 40:25.453
Okay, I don't wanna talk about it, okay.

40:25.455 --> 40:26.743
But did you see her arm,

40:26.745 --> 40:28.673
like how deep those were?

40:28.675 --> 40:31.758
- And how bloody and...
- TJ, I saw it, I was there.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.723
I'm just saying, there's
something wrong with,

40:34.725 --> 40:36.033
there's something off with her.

40:36.035 --> 40:38.638
She's fine, she just
needs to sleep, okay.

40:39.225 --> 40:40.725
She'll be fine in the morning.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.128
Are you serious?

40:42.285 --> 40:43.858
I'm very serious.

40:43.895 --> 40:46.275
Ah okay, so even if she falls asleep

40:46.335 --> 40:48.988
and wakes up miraculously better mentally,

40:49.405 --> 40:51.023
she still lost a ton of blood.

40:51.025 --> 40:52.103
And she's gonna have to go to a hospital.

40:52.105 --> 40:54.675
TJ, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.295
Let's just go to bed.

40:57.686 --> 41:01.995
You know, or, or, we
could have some sex.

41:03.766 --> 41:04.728
Okay.

41:05.525 --> 41:06.575
- You serious?
- No.

41:10.814 --> 41:12.298
That's fucked up Em.

41:25.804 --> 41:28.304
You're gonna be okay.

41:30.345 --> 41:32.128
Wake me up if you need anything.

41:32.944 --> 41:33.777
Okay.

41:35.255 --> 41:36.755
I love you babe.

41:37.994 --> 41:39.411
I love you too.

47:53.935 --> 47:56.675
What the fuck?

47:56.677 --> 47:57.844
What the fuck?

47:59.595 --> 48:00.428
Em!

48:01.297 --> 48:02.130
Emma!

48:02.948 --> 48:05.048
Em, hey, hey!

48:06.415 --> 48:07.246
Go away.

48:07.248 --> 48:08.365
Look honey, are you bleeding?

48:09.221 --> 48:11.923
- What?
- Good.

48:11.925 --> 48:13.238
Hey man, shut up.

48:13.295 --> 48:15.278
Honey, you have blood on your face.

48:16.243 --> 48:17.143
No, no I don't.

48:17.145 --> 48:17.976
You have blood right there.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.038
Look at your pillow.

48:25.185 --> 48:26.435
How the fuck?

48:32.525 --> 48:34.888
Well, where's it coming from?

48:35.479 --> 48:36.729
I don't know.

48:37.088 --> 48:37.919
Are you bleeding?

48:37.921 --> 48:39.288
I don't think it's coming from me.

48:39.905 --> 48:41.633
Well if you're not bleeding
and I'm not bleeding,

48:41.635 --> 48:43.035
then where's it coming from?

48:46.905 --> 48:47.738
Vikki?

48:50.615 --> 48:52.533
- Has to be.
- Oh fuck that crazy bitch.

48:52.535 --> 48:54.518
She's not a crazy bitch.

48:56.915 --> 48:57.748
What?

49:04.995 --> 49:07.938
Is that the bandage from last night?

49:08.455 --> 49:10.548
- Yeah.
- That's disgusting.

49:11.145 --> 49:12.218
Go wash your hands.

49:13.639 --> 49:14.553
Then we're gonna find your friend.

49:14.555 --> 49:15.405
We'll find her.

49:15.550 --> 49:17.798
But you've gotta wash your
hands and change your boxers.

49:21.196 --> 49:22.046
Vikki.

49:22.295 --> 49:24.223
- Mike, where's Vikki?
- What, what's wrong?

49:24.225 --> 49:26.025
We woke up with blood all over us.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.613
Yeah, we found that bandage
she was wearing last night

49:28.615 --> 49:29.765
at the foot of our bed.

49:30.933 --> 49:31.768
Fuck, um.

49:33.025 --> 49:34.433
You didn't hear or feel anything

49:34.435 --> 49:35.273
in the middle of the night, nothing?

49:35.275 --> 49:36.108
No.

49:36.413 --> 49:37.246
I was out.

49:37.395 --> 49:38.233
All right, well we have to find her.

49:38.235 --> 49:40.308
TJ, will you please go
upstairs and look for her?

49:40.542 --> 49:42.209
All right, let's go.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.328
What the fuck?

50:02.436 --> 50:03.269
I don't know.

50:04.085 --> 50:05.316
Why would she take her bandage off?

50:05.318 --> 50:06.149
I don't know.

50:06.151 --> 50:07.153
She lost so much blood yesterday.

50:07.155 --> 50:08.505
TJ, you found anything yet?

50:08.925 --> 50:09.758
Yeah.

50:09.865 --> 50:12.315
Found a large clump of
bloody hair in the toilet.

50:12.455 --> 50:14.355
So apparently, she hurt herself again.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.713
I knew we should have
called the hospital.

50:16.715 --> 50:18.808
Yeah or a nuthouse, crazy bitch.

50:19.865 --> 50:20.698
Really?

50:22.798 --> 50:24.213
You don't consider how she's behaved

50:24.215 --> 50:25.828
the last 12 hours crazy?

50:27.675 --> 50:28.625
You're not wrong.

50:29.685 --> 50:31.948
Look man, I don't know
what's happening with Vikki.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.873
But I know you being an
asshole is not gonna help.

50:33.875 --> 50:35.525
Guys, we just have to find her.

50:36.325 --> 50:37.823
And neither does
leaving the door wide open

50:37.825 --> 50:39.225
when it's this cold outside.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.483
I didn't leave the door open.

50:46.805 --> 50:47.638
Me either.

50:50.645 --> 50:52.578
I'll give you three
guesses where Vikki is, guys.

50:57.286 --> 50:58.619
- Vikki!
- Vikki!

51:01.634 --> 51:02.884
Vikki!

51:03.905 --> 51:05.155
Come babe, where are you?

51:06.035 --> 51:07.338
Where you think she got off to?

51:07.879 --> 51:09.058
She could be anywhere.

51:09.335 --> 51:10.623
She couldn't have gone far.

51:10.625 --> 51:12.083
I don't think she grabbed a jacket.

51:12.085 --> 51:14.003
- Good way to be negative.
- Thanks for that.

51:14.005 --> 51:15.483
I'm just saying, it's freezing out here

51:15.485 --> 51:16.903
and I don't think she's
in the right state of mind

51:16.905 --> 51:18.405
to bundle up and start a fire.

51:18.595 --> 51:19.428
Vikki!

51:19.718 --> 51:21.918
Look I hate to be the
one to say this but,

51:22.541 --> 51:23.713
I think we got a better
chance of finding her

51:23.715 --> 51:25.008
if we split up.

51:25.565 --> 51:27.758
You guys head that way,
I'll look over here.

51:29.865 --> 51:30.698
Vikki!

51:32.285 --> 51:33.965
Come on Vik, where are you?

51:44.283 --> 51:45.866
Vik, where are you?

51:55.402 --> 51:56.235
Vikki!

52:03.143 --> 52:05.643
Vikki, where are you?

52:06.720 --> 52:08.182
What are we even doing out here?

52:08.184 --> 52:09.043
What are you talking about TJ?

52:09.045 --> 52:10.663
You saw the condition
she was in last night.

52:10.665 --> 52:11.496
What do you expect?

52:11.498 --> 52:12.482
She's just gonna stroll out the woods

52:12.484 --> 52:13.713
and be like hey guys,
let's go get a drink.

52:13.715 --> 52:15.220
TJ, this is no time for
you to be a dick, okay.

52:15.222 --> 52:16.980
- I'm not being a dick.
- Yes, you are.

52:16.982 --> 52:18.493
I'm being a realist.

52:18.495 --> 52:19.973
More than likely, she has hyperthermia

52:19.975 --> 52:21.725
or she's faced down somewhere dead.

52:22.115 --> 52:22.946
What the fuck was that for?

52:22.948 --> 52:25.053
She is my best friend
and that's why the fuck

52:25.055 --> 52:26.133
we're out here you dick.

52:26.135 --> 52:27.738
I understand.

52:28.185 --> 52:30.143
I'm simply saying with the blood loss

52:30.145 --> 52:32.743
and lack of jacket, the
odds that she's still alive

52:32.745 --> 52:33.831
is very, very slim.

52:33.833 --> 52:35.845
That does not mean that
I can't look for her.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.413
What if the tables were turned?

52:38.415 --> 52:40.227
And I was out here alone,
would you look for me?

52:44.564 --> 52:45.395
That's what I thought.

52:45.397 --> 52:46.625
- Really?
- Fucking asshole.

52:49.245 --> 52:50.908
You're gonna go off in
the woods by yourself?

52:51.545 --> 52:52.845
Yeah, 'cause that's smart.

53:07.703 --> 53:08.638
Where are you babe?

53:11.463 --> 53:12.296
Vikki!

53:21.963 --> 53:22.796
Vik!

53:24.965 --> 53:25.798
Come on babe!

53:47.322 --> 53:48.155
Vikki!

53:50.462 --> 53:51.629
Where are you?

53:57.386 --> 53:58.219
Mike?

54:00.064 --> 54:00.897
TJ?

54:08.192 --> 54:09.895
Where the fuck am I?

54:19.175 --> 54:20.975
Of course, I have no fucking signal.

54:43.730 --> 54:44.980
Vikki!

54:46.035 --> 54:46.868
Vik!

54:51.589 --> 54:52.422
Hello?

54:56.992 --> 54:58.075
Anyone there?

55:14.807 --> 55:16.071
Seriously, if she's
getting warm in the cabin,

55:16.073 --> 55:17.223
I'm gonna be so pissed.

55:18.805 --> 55:19.638
Hey!

55:20.295 --> 55:21.188
Vikki, what.

55:24.975 --> 55:25.808
You okay?

55:26.995 --> 55:28.208
We've looked everywhere.

55:32.466 --> 55:35.318
Where you going?

55:36.505 --> 55:39.138
Vikki, don't run away from me.

55:48.266 --> 55:49.322
Vik!

56:00.226 --> 56:01.547
Vikki!

56:10.451 --> 56:15.312
Vikki!

56:15.314 --> 56:16.147
Vikki!

56:21.925 --> 56:22.758
Emma!

56:24.305 --> 56:26.378
Mike, I found her.

56:33.455 --> 56:34.288
Vikki!

56:35.705 --> 56:36.538
Hey!

56:37.025 --> 56:38.068
It's TJ.

56:39.155 --> 56:42.055
I know we aren't friends but

56:43.245 --> 56:46.035
we're all kind of worried
about you especially Emma, so.

56:49.195 --> 56:51.148
You don't look so good.

56:51.305 --> 56:53.468
So let's go get you warmed up.

56:54.445 --> 56:56.095
Let's go get you some help, okay?

56:59.135 --> 56:59.968
Vikki?

57:04.625 --> 57:05.458
Vikki, hey.

57:10.059 --> 57:11.309
Vikki, come on.

57:15.385 --> 57:16.218
Vikki.

57:25.699 --> 57:26.745
Wait, what are you doing?

57:31.405 --> 57:32.408
Stay the fuck there.

57:35.265 --> 57:37.388
Seriously Vikki, Vikki.

57:39.095 --> 57:39.928
Stop.

57:40.145 --> 57:41.095
God damn it, Vikki.

57:46.965 --> 57:49.390
What the fuck, someone help.

57:54.059 --> 57:55.253
- Hey.
- What the fuck Mike!

57:55.255 --> 57:56.534
It's okay, it's me.

57:56.536 --> 57:57.367
You all right?

57:57.369 --> 57:58.388
Yeah, did you hear that?

57:59.325 --> 58:00.158
Yeah, I did.

58:00.967 --> 58:02.768
It's TJ, it was TJ screaming.

58:04.551 --> 58:05.743
- I thought he was with you?
- No!

58:05.745 --> 58:07.608
We got in a fight so he stormed off.

58:07.716 --> 58:09.846
I don't know where he went.

58:09.848 --> 58:11.366
Oh fuck.

58:11.368 --> 58:14.068
Well let's try and find him
and get back to the cabin.

58:14.795 --> 58:15.795
We'll regroup there.

58:16.905 --> 58:17.738
Okay.

58:18.565 --> 58:20.365
That was his screaming though, Mike.

58:33.845 --> 58:34.676
When are we getting there Mikey?

58:34.678 --> 58:36.595
I don't know, I don't know these woods.

58:37.095 --> 58:38.093
You're suppose to know these things.

58:38.095 --> 58:39.538
You're a fucking Boy Scout.

58:40.085 --> 58:41.528
- Is that a road?
- Yes!

58:47.775 --> 58:48.608
Which way?

58:49.558 --> 58:50.558
Let's say, that way.

58:51.075 --> 58:53.225
- Is that a yes?
- Yes, let's go, come on.

58:54.565 --> 58:55.433
This is your aunt's house.

58:55.435 --> 58:57.088
How do you not know which way to go?

58:57.090 --> 58:57.921
That doesn't mean

58:57.923 --> 58:59.204
I know anything about these woods.

59:01.405 --> 59:02.238
Emma wait.

59:03.127 --> 59:04.294
What?

59:04.745 --> 59:05.945
What the fuck is that?

59:10.821 --> 59:11.904
You see that?

59:23.481 --> 59:25.231
No, no, no, no, no.

59:25.330 --> 59:26.913
Emma, wait, Emma!

59:32.451 --> 59:33.618
What the fuck?

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:14.073
There she is.

01:00:15.934 --> 01:00:17.017
There she is.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.011
We gotta go.

01:00:19.013 --> 01:00:20.463
Fuck, we're getting out of here.

01:00:20.465 --> 01:00:21.298
Fuck!

01:00:40.152 --> 01:00:41.852
You get a signal yet?

01:00:41.854 --> 01:00:42.687
Check it.

01:00:46.256 --> 01:00:48.089
Ah, I got something.

01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:50.327
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, call.

01:00:51.535 --> 01:00:52.746
911,
what's your emergency.

01:00:52.748 --> 01:00:55.128
Hi, yeah, we need help.

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.698
What's the address?

01:00:56.855 --> 01:00:58.133
It's Hard To Find Drive.

01:00:58.135 --> 01:00:58.966
Really?

01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:00.318
Yeah, that's what it's called.

01:01:00.544 --> 01:01:01.598
Hello?

01:01:02.485 --> 01:01:03.318
Fuck!

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:05.958
What happened, what the fuck?

01:01:06.342 --> 01:01:07.173
I lost it.

01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:08.133
- Did you hear someone?
- I did.

01:01:08.135 --> 01:01:09.129
- Good.
- But I lost them.

01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:09.973
Are they sending someone?

01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:12.245
Yeah, I think, I don't know.

01:01:12.777 --> 01:01:14.288
Call 'em back.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:18.487
I'm trying.

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:19.322
Fuck.

01:01:23.687 --> 01:01:25.295
Fuck, run Emma, run!

01:01:50.116 --> 01:01:51.116
- Wait.
- What?

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.438
I thought I heard something.

01:01:58.384 --> 01:01:59.996
Don't hear anything.

01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:11.668
What the fuck is she doing?

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.347
Stalking.

01:02:18.064 --> 01:02:19.397
Stalking what?

01:02:22.224 --> 01:02:23.055
Us.

01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:26.565
This cannot be fucking happening.

01:02:27.045 --> 01:02:29.148
We're gonna make
it out of this alive, okay?

01:02:29.185 --> 01:02:30.913
Not, if we
don't have cell service.

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:33.978
I get it, this whole thing is fucked up.

01:02:34.955 --> 01:02:36.188
But we can't lose our shit.

01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:38.623
I think we just gotta keep moving.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:39.463
If we can make it to the car,

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.003
we can get the fuck out of here.

01:02:41.005 --> 01:02:41.898
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:43.123
- Okay.
- Ready?

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:43.975
- Let's go.
- Go

01:02:55.618 --> 01:02:56.701
We're here.

01:02:57.824 --> 01:02:59.028
Emma, do you have the car keys?

01:02:59.605 --> 01:03:01.488
Emma, where are the keys?

01:03:02.365 --> 01:03:04.568
He, he has the keys.

01:03:05.595 --> 01:03:06.428
You mean TJ?

01:03:07.679 --> 01:03:08.512
They're on him?

01:03:09.645 --> 01:03:11.468
No, they're in the house.

01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:12.773
They're in the house.

01:03:12.775 --> 01:03:14.133
Are they in the house
or does TJ have them?

01:03:14.135 --> 01:03:15.238
Emma, come on.

01:03:15.445 --> 01:03:16.644
They're in the house.

01:03:16.646 --> 01:03:18.343
- You're sure?
- Yeah, there is.

01:03:18.345 --> 01:03:19.887
Great, good, come on.

01:03:19.889 --> 01:03:20.720
Come on.

01:03:25.615 --> 01:03:27.808
Mikey, the door.

01:03:29.094 --> 01:03:29.927
The door's open.

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:33.541
We didn't leave it open did we?

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.105
I'm gonna throw up.

01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:39.147
I need the keys.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.353
Those keys are our only
chance of getting out of here.

01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:42.398
We have to go in.

01:03:42.933 --> 01:03:44.688
No, they keys are there.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.365
Can you go?

01:03:47.367 --> 01:03:51.108
I'll stay here.

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:52.246
I'm be right here.

01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:53.428
Just stay here, I'll.

01:03:54.365 --> 01:03:56.115
I'll go find the car key.

01:03:56.247 --> 01:03:57.747
Okay, good luck.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.413
- Don't move.
- I won't.

01:05:08.725 --> 01:05:09.558
Mikey?

01:05:12.885 --> 01:05:14.578
Mikey, where are you?

01:05:18.075 --> 01:05:18.908
Mikey, hurry up!

01:05:21.235 --> 01:05:22.785
Emma, I don't see these keys.

01:06:01.318 --> 01:06:02.318
I'm sorry.

01:06:03.605 --> 01:06:04.438
Vikki.

01:06:05.305 --> 01:06:07.444
Vikki, don't do this.

01:06:12.634 --> 01:06:13.634
I'm sorry.

01:06:25.443 --> 01:06:28.640
Mikey.

01:06:28.642 --> 01:06:29.475
Mikey.

01:06:32.873 --> 01:06:33.706
Mikey.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.346
Mike.

01:07:27.872 --> 01:07:29.548
Emma, I don't see the keys, Emma!

01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:34.875
Emma!

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:36.708
No.

01:07:41.214 --> 01:07:42.047
Fuck.

01:07:44.155 --> 01:07:45.083
Get your hands up!

01:07:45.085 --> 01:07:46.423
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:46.425 --> 01:07:48.068
I swear, this wasn't me.

01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:51.288
Stand up and move
back against the table.

01:07:56.425 --> 01:07:57.523
I swear, I didn't do this.

01:07:57.525 --> 01:07:58.708
If you move.

01:08:00.005 --> 01:08:01.758
I will pull this trigger.

01:08:02.215 --> 01:08:03.428
You stay right there.

01:08:09.115 --> 01:08:09.958
She's dead.

01:08:10.555 --> 01:08:11.423
My girlfriend killed her.

01:08:11.425 --> 01:08:13.075
She's gonna kill me, too, please.

01:08:13.305 --> 01:08:14.905
You've gotta get me out of here.

01:08:15.465 --> 01:08:16.982
You need to relax sir.

01:08:20.519 --> 01:08:21.352
Oh boy.

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:24.225
I swear this wasn't me.

01:08:24.415 --> 01:08:26.443
My girlfriend, she's been
fucked up this whole weekend.

01:08:26.444 --> 01:08:27.276
She did this.

01:08:27.278 --> 01:08:28.743
She gutted my friend TJ.

01:08:28.745 --> 01:08:30.993
She, she killed her,
she's gonna kill me too.

01:08:30.995 --> 01:08:32.113
- Please.
- Stand right there.

01:08:32.115 --> 01:08:33.733
You gotta get me out of here, please.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:34.917
She's in the house.

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:37.805
Is there anybody up there?

01:08:40.348 --> 01:08:41.787
Anybody up there?

01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:45.298
This the police, come on down.

01:08:53.835 --> 01:08:56.778
Officer, I'm telling you,
she, she killed my friends.

01:08:57.814 --> 01:08:58.973
She's around here somewhere, too.

01:08:58.975 --> 01:09:00.175
She's trying to kill me.

01:09:05.234 --> 01:09:06.962
Officer, what the fuck are we doing here?

01:09:06.965 --> 01:09:08.215
We gotta get out of here!

01:09:09.365 --> 01:09:10.268
Please!

01:09:11.805 --> 01:09:14.167
Are you gonna call for
backup or something, you?

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:20.604
Where's your car?

01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:22.528
Excuse me?

01:09:22.935 --> 01:09:24.198
Your car, your cruiser.

01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:26.234
How'd you get here?

01:09:27.198 --> 01:09:28.031
What?

01:09:29.782 --> 01:09:30.732
Wait, I know you.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:34.203
You, you were at the coffee shop.

01:09:34.205 --> 01:09:35.705
You bought our fucking coffee.

01:09:36.935 --> 01:09:38.102
Yeah, I did.

01:09:40.893 --> 01:09:43.589
What the fuck is going on here?

01:09:43.591 --> 01:09:45.091
Who are you, what?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.457
What do you want?

01:09:57.828 --> 01:09:58.661
Sorry.

01:10:06.905 --> 01:10:08.288
Well, we found her.

01:10:09.634 --> 01:10:11.718
Help me, get her off of me.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.773
Nah.

01:10:13.148 --> 01:10:15.398
Nah, I think I'll see
how this one plays out.

01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:17.828
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:19.798
Help.

01:10:21.025 --> 01:10:22.453
Y'all put up quite a fight today.

01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:24.128
I will give you that, wow.

01:10:24.695 --> 01:10:25.945
Vikki, Vikki.

01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:28.424
Vikki.

01:10:30.286 --> 01:10:32.424
Vikki, Vikki.

01:10:32.426 --> 01:10:33.509
Please don't.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.963
Please.

01:10:35.941 --> 01:10:36.774
Hey, hey.

01:10:39.384 --> 01:10:41.856
I love you.

01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:43.275
I love you too.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.802
I'm so sorry.

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:10.804
I'm sorry.

01:11:29.845 --> 01:11:30.678
Why me?

01:11:32.645 --> 01:11:33.618
Why you?

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:35.785
Oh baby, aw come on.

01:11:37.445 --> 01:11:39.058
No matter how hard you try,

01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:41.703
there's always these egomaniac monologues

01:11:41.705 --> 01:11:45.820
seen in every horror movie,
you know what I mean?

01:11:45.822 --> 01:11:47.822
But I guess it is what it is, I suppose.

01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:53.588
Your generation of full
of lazy degenerates.

01:11:54.335 --> 01:11:55.323
None of your are righteous.

01:11:55.325 --> 01:11:56.908
All of you are immoral.

01:11:57.075 --> 01:11:59.748
You don't wanna work for
anything, not a damn thing!

01:12:01.864 --> 01:12:03.283
You're the murderer,
you're the immoral one.

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:04.118
What?

01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:06.138
I'm a murderer?

01:12:06.525 --> 01:12:08.853
No, I am not a murderer!

01:12:08.855 --> 01:12:10.655
I never touched any of your friends.

01:12:10.845 --> 01:12:13.043
You turned all that
repressed anger and hatred

01:12:13.045 --> 01:12:15.395
and you took it out on
the ones closest to you.

01:12:16.505 --> 01:12:18.355
I just gave you the means, baby doll,

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.358
to do what was in your heart.

01:12:21.885 --> 01:12:26.322
To destroy those closest to you.

01:12:27.364 --> 01:12:29.238
Aw, let me show you something.

01:12:32.255 --> 01:12:33.838
This little creation of mine.

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:39.146
It will mess you up.

01:12:42.145 --> 01:12:45.530
I made this to bring all the
repressed rage inside of you

01:12:45.532 --> 01:12:47.593
and you show yourself who you truly are

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:50.448
because you my dear, are the killer.

01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:53.848
And I didn't create you, I
just removed your filter.

01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:57.233
I wish you could understand
how truly pathetic

01:12:57.235 --> 01:12:59.618
your generation is to society, Vikki.

01:13:01.035 --> 01:13:03.283
You don't deserve this,
you don't deserve anything!

01:13:03.285 --> 01:13:05.328
Love, compassion, friendship.

01:13:05.725 --> 01:13:07.288
You never earned it!

01:13:10.972 --> 01:13:12.875
Oh, stop, I ain't done.

01:13:16.675 --> 01:13:18.848
I hate a crying woman.

01:13:28.624 --> 01:13:30.624
Finish what you started.

01:13:47.986 --> 01:13:48.819
Hmm.

01:14:02.979 --> 01:14:07.979
Thank you baby.

01:14:28.949 --> 01:14:29.840
You girls have your lunches?

01:14:29.842 --> 01:14:30.787
Yep.

01:14:30.789 --> 01:14:31.854
All right, have a good day.

01:14:31.856 --> 01:14:32.687
- You too.
- All right.

01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:33.689
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:14:50.843 --> 01:14:52.676
Good morning ladies.

01:14:52.723 --> 01:14:53.929
- Do you have your homework?
- Yes.

01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:54.998
- Do we have our lunches?
- Yes.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.878
Are you ready for...

01:15:02.817 --> 01:15:03.993
Good morning, thank you.

01:15:03.995 --> 01:15:05.662
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:15:06.697 --> 01:15:08.464
Have a great day, little lady.

01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:09.815
Thank you.

01:15:16.815 --> 01:15:21.815
