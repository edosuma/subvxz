00:26.770 --> 00:31.070
Banish our fears.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.160
Uphold and sustain us.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.910
Banish our fears.

00:43.330 --> 00:47.380
Uphold and sustain us.

27:35.650 --> 27:39.200
<i>You came back. I knew you would.</i>

27:40.530 --> 27:42.320
<i>I missed you.</i>

27:53.670 --> 27:58.590
What happened to me
the last time I was here?

27:58.590 --> 28:01.390
What was that place I went to?

28:01.760 --> 28:04.050
Can you take me back there?

28:04.180 --> 28:06.850
<i>Why do you want to go back there?</i>

28:07.470 --> 28:10.230
I'm trying to understand all this...

28:10.230 --> 28:12.480
<i>...understand what you are.</i>

28:12.980 --> 28:16.190
<i>You don't think I'm real, do you?</i>

28:16.190 --> 28:20.950
I don't know what you are.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.870
<i>Take off your helmet.</i>

28:26.700 --> 28:28.080
Why?

28:29.370 --> 28:32.670
<i>So I can show you who I am.</i>

29:34.480 --> 29:37.360
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

29:40.480 --> 29:42.530
What is this?

29:46.700 --> 29:48.950
<i>A memory.</i>

29:56.670 --> 29:59.420
I don't remember this.

29:59.670 --> 30:03.670
<i>Because it's my memory, not yours.</i>

30:05.300 --> 30:09.850
<i>The first time I ever flew a kite.</i>

30:12.720 --> 30:17.060
<i>When I was a girl,
I used to fly in my dreams.</i>

30:17.520 --> 30:22.400
<i>I'd float above my home,
calling down to everyone I know.</i>

30:22.400 --> 30:26.700
<i>I'd pity all the people below--</i>

30:26.700 --> 30:30.200
<i>bound to the earth.</i>

30:30.200 --> 30:35.750
<i>Unable to understand
how free it was above.</i>

30:48.720 --> 30:51.810
<i>You could be free.</i>

30:52.600 --> 30:56.730
<i>Up here, with me.</i>

30:59.230 --> 31:04.280
This... isn't real.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.410
<i>This is proof it's real.</i>

31:11.870 --> 31:17.120
<i>Can you still feel how much I love you?</i>

32:07.380 --> 32:10.880
<i>I love you, Mitsuki.</i>

32:12.090 --> 32:14.390
I love you, too.

32:14.390 --> 32:17.770
I always will, Hinata.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.070
I wanted to be with you.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.200
But this isn't real.

32:35.030 --> 32:36.830
I'm sorry...
