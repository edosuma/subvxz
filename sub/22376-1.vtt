00:12.433 --> 00:14.333
[woman speaking indistinctly]

02:12.066 --> 02:14.000
[Wilfred] To whom it may concern.

02:16.066 --> 02:20.700
My name is Wilfred Leland James,
and this is my confession.

02:33.033 --> 02:36.400
The issue that led to my crime
and damnation...

02:37.133 --> 02:41.766
was 100 acres of good land
in Hemingford Home, Nebraska...

02:42.200 --> 02:47.700
willed to my wife,
Arlette Christina Winters James.

02:47.766 --> 02:50.100
Following the death of her father.

02:51.333 --> 02:56.533
It was much my intention to add her 100
to our 80-acre freehold farm,

02:56.600 --> 03:01.300
as it was to someday
pass it all on to my boy,

03:01.766 --> 03:03.600
Henry Freeman James,

03:04.333 --> 03:06.133
and to his thereafter.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.633
- Now, you can still find reverse?
- Yes, sir.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.766
Show me.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.666
- The middle one.
- All right. All right, you're ready.

03:23.466 --> 03:25.366
Maybe not for Omaha just yet or...

03:25.633 --> 03:29.400
Even Lincoln, but... you take her slow...
in Hemingford Home

03:29.466 --> 03:30.766
and you ought to be just fine.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.133
All right? What'd I say?

03:32.566 --> 03:33.566
Uh...

03:34.233 --> 03:35.433
- Slow.
- Slow.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.533
[Wilfred]
In 1922, a man's pride was a man's land.

03:46.333 --> 03:47.533
And so was his son.

04:08.266 --> 04:09.366
[Henry grunts]

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
Mm.

04:22.366 --> 04:23.600
It's not too sour.

04:23.733 --> 04:24.733
Not too sweet.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.566
[Wilfred] Nope.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.133
It's just right.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
[Arlette chuckles]

04:33.033 --> 04:34.033
[Wilfred] My wife...

04:34.700 --> 04:37.333
who never did take to the farming life,

04:37.400 --> 04:40.200
wished to cash in her new land

04:42.000 --> 04:44.300
She wanted us to leave all this behind.

04:45.566 --> 04:48.433
So, what do you propose we do
with all this money and no land?

04:55.066 --> 04:56.066
We could move.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.166
To Omaha.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.633
Or even St. Louis.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.273
[Wilfred chuckles, then sniffs]

05:05.666 --> 05:07.166
Cities are for fools.

05:08.733 --> 05:10.033
[Henry] Ma, I agree with Pa.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.500
I don't wanna live in Omaha or any city.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.000
We can talk about this after supper.

06:29.033 --> 06:32.133
[Wilfred] If we can't agree,
you should go on to your mother's.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.266
[Arlette] And leave you
my father's land, I suppose?

06:34.433 --> 06:36.133
That'll never happen, Wilf.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.300
Well...

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
then...

06:41.733 --> 06:43.466
you let me buy that land from you.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.500
How are you gonna do that?

06:47.066 --> 06:49.200
It'd have to be over a period of time.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.033
Eight years.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
[scoffs]

06:54.100 --> 06:57.166
Perhaps ten, but I'll pay you, Arlette.
I'll pay you every cent.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.233
A little money coming in
is worse than none.

07:00.033 --> 07:01.700
Farringtons will buy it outright.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.566
Their idea of top dollar
is apt to be far more generous than yours.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.200
Anyway, I've had an idea of my own.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.233
[sighs]

07:17.000 --> 07:20.766
We sell the 100 acres and the farm
to the Farrington combine.

07:21.033 --> 07:23.766
They'd buy it all just to get that close
to the railway line.

07:24.733 --> 07:25.733
And then...

07:27.133 --> 07:28.466
we split the money.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
Divorce.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.600
We both know that's what you want.

07:41.666 --> 07:42.666
And, uh...

07:44.466 --> 07:45.466
who, uh...?

07:49.366 --> 07:51.700
Which one of us would the boy go with?

07:52.300 --> 07:53.300
Me.

07:54.066 --> 07:56.633
Of course.
A boy of 14 needs to be with his mother.

08:00.266 --> 08:02.333
Now, that ain't fair on him, Arlette.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.633
Now, you taking him away
from everything he knows.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.433
- You would do that?
- Fair? Fair?

08:09.533 --> 08:12.466
Life is rarely fair, Wilf.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.066
Especially out here.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.566
Hmm.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.433
All right, I need a little...

08:34.232 --> 08:35.265
[sighs]

08:35.332 --> 08:37.700
Just give me a little time
to think that all over.

09:05.766 --> 09:10.666
As a husband, I thought of going
to the law on the matter.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.433
And yet something held me back.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.266
It was not fear of neighbors chatter
or country gossip.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.400
No, it was something else.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.500
I had come to hate her.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That was what held me back.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.700
[bucket clanging]

09:45.233 --> 09:46.233
[bucket clanging]

09:49.166 --> 09:51.500
Goddamn it, Wilf.
You scared the life out of me.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
What?

10:00.266 --> 10:03.566
I've decided
that you won't be selling them 100 acres.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.366
Oh, have you?

10:07.633 --> 10:08.633
Not without a fight.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.400
The Farringtons
will bring the fight to you, Wilf.

10:16.733 --> 10:19.133
Right to you. And I'll happi...

10:22.366 --> 10:23.366
[bucket clanging]

11:00.433 --> 11:03.466
[Wilfred]
And I believe that there's another man...

11:04.133 --> 11:06.033
inside of every man.

11:14.766 --> 11:15.766
A stranger.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.233
A conniving man.

11:31.533 --> 11:32.533
Henry?

11:36.766 --> 11:38.333
What you doing down here, bo...?

11:41.700 --> 11:42.733
Shannon.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.133
Mr. James.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.333
Why don't you head on home, girl?
I need a word with Henry.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
Yes, sir.

11:52.733 --> 11:53.733
See you tomorrow.

11:54.633 --> 11:55.700
See you tomorrow.

11:58.766 --> 12:00.000
What do you want, Pa?

12:01.633 --> 12:04.533
[Wilfred] That spring Henry
had grown sweet

12:04.600 --> 12:07.133
on the Cotterie girl from next door.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.766
I've been meaning to pluck these
for a while now.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.233
Henry, they're...

12:14.333 --> 12:15.433
They're beautiful.

12:16.566 --> 12:17.566
Heh.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.233
Let's find a vase.

12:23.400 --> 12:29.166
[Wilfred] And the conniving man thought
he might use this to his advantage.

12:36.733 --> 12:39.766
Shannon wouldn't be
in your life anymore.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.233
Of course, neither would I.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.600
[Henry] Papa, what are we gonna do?

12:45.300 --> 12:46.300
[Wilfred] Well...

12:47.133 --> 12:50.433
Sometimes the only thing to do...

12:51.133 --> 12:55.433
is... to take the thing
that you must have.

12:56.366 --> 12:57.233
No...

12:57.300 --> 12:59.466
Even if somebody get hurt.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.366
Even if someone dies.

13:04.066 --> 13:05.066
Papa?

13:07.266 --> 13:08.266
Well...

13:10.766 --> 13:11.766
If she was gone...

13:13.433 --> 13:16.366
well, everything would be the way it was.

13:17.766 --> 13:20.066
And all the arguments, that would cease.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.300
We could live here peacefully.

13:31.166 --> 13:32.366
[sighs]

13:36.766 --> 13:40.566
I've offered her everything I can
to make her go, and she won't go.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.733
There's only one thing I can do.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.666
That... we can do.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.100
[Arlette] Henry!

14:01.600 --> 14:03.133
Give your mama a kiss.

14:12.466 --> 14:13.466
What's wrong with you?

14:15.666 --> 14:16.666
Nothing, Ma.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.566
I'm fine.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.166
Can I have some beer?

14:37.566 --> 14:39.166
You can finish that off.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.700
But no more of this tomorrow.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.533
Nor the day after, mind.

15:12.533 --> 15:15.333
Well, a murdered man or a woman

15:16.066 --> 15:20.566
dies not on God's time
but on man's.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.000
And if she is cut short
before atoning for sin,

15:25.066 --> 15:26.233
well...

15:27.700 --> 15:29.633
all errors must be forgiven.

15:35.433 --> 15:36.566
But what about us, Pa?

15:37.133 --> 15:38.066
[Wilfred grunts]

15:38.133 --> 15:39.333
Wouldn't we go to hell?

15:39.400 --> 15:42.500
How can you say so
when you see heaven all around us?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.066
Yet she means to drive us away from it.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.133
And think.

15:48.666 --> 15:51.600
If she does go to Omaha... Well...

15:53.266 --> 15:56.266
she'll be digging her an even deeper pit
in Sheol.

15:56.666 --> 15:57.666
If she takes you...

15:58.600 --> 16:00.200
you'll become a city boy.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.433
Yeah. Just forget all this and...

16:04.566 --> 16:06.733
and start learning city ways.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.066
Begin digging your own pit.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.000
[Arlette] Eat or starve, Henry.

16:28.633 --> 16:29.733
The choice is yours.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.366
[scoffs]

16:33.433 --> 16:34.666
And you, you just sit there.

16:34.733 --> 16:35.733
[Henry] Leave off.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.642
- What did you say?
- [Henry] I said...

16:37.666 --> 16:40.333
leave off, so we can be a family again.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
[sniffs]

16:52.733 --> 16:55.366
The lawyer assures me the land is mine...

16:56.700 --> 16:58.233
to do with as I wish.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.366
And I'm gonna sell.

17:01.566 --> 17:05.133
Now, you can sit here
and smell roasting hogs,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.098
cook your own dinner, make your own bed.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.066
But you, my son,
are coming with me to Omaha.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.566
I am gonna open a dress shop.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.366
That's my idea of fair.

17:16.598 --> 17:18.598
[Arlette stomping]

17:55.600 --> 17:57.133
[Arlette] Don't fool with me, Wilf.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.233
I'm not now. Henry and I have had
many conversations about this.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.133
He wants to go.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.400
Least try it on for size.

18:07.066 --> 18:10.200
And I thought I might look for work
as a mechanic.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.466
Cars and trucks, but...

18:12.733 --> 18:15.333
Farm machinery mostly. You know.

18:15.533 --> 18:18.166
If I can keep that old Farmall running,
hell...

18:18.666 --> 18:20.533
[chuckles]
I guess I can keep anything running.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
You're not fooling?

18:25.566 --> 18:27.166
And Henry talked you into this?

18:27.266 --> 18:29.066
Yeah. He convinced me...

18:29.733 --> 18:30.733
it'd be better to...

18:32.433 --> 18:34.566
take a chance at being happy in town

18:35.200 --> 18:38.766
than to stay out here on my own
in, uh, what would be...

18:42.233 --> 18:43.266
sure misery.

18:47.633 --> 18:48.633
Whoo!

18:49.466 --> 18:52.400
- The boy talks sense and the man listens?
- [laughing]

18:52.700 --> 18:54.333
At long last.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
Hallelujah.

18:57.633 --> 18:59.366
[Wilfred]
Either that or a hit in the head.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.433
[Arlette laughing]

19:00.500 --> 19:02.300
That's not too bad. No.

19:03.300 --> 19:09.400
[Arlette] Henry, come out here!
Let's celebrate.

19:09.466 --> 19:11.466
[jazz music playing on record player]

19:14.433 --> 19:15.600
- Henry.
- Stop.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.200
Finally we're all together.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.533
- My men see sense.
- All right. Stop.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
Oh!

19:22.433 --> 19:23.566
Shoot.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.333
If you're good, Wilf,
you can suck it out of the cloth later on.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.633
Oh, no need to be so prissy.
I've seen you with Shannon Cotterie.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.200
Pretty face and a nice little figure.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.700
Mm.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.400
If you're not getting a touch of that,
you're a fool.

19:42.033 --> 19:45.666
Just be careful. Fourteen's not too young
to marry out here in the middle.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.266
[Arlette clicking]

19:49.700 --> 19:51.333
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.400
[chuckles]

19:53.666 --> 19:56.200
Here's to Shannon Cotterie
and her future bubbies,

19:56.266 --> 20:00.366
and if my son don't know the color
of her nipples, he's a slowpoke.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.333
Make sure when you're laying down
with her in the corn

20:03.400 --> 20:06.433
or behind the barn that you're a no poke.

20:07.566 --> 20:10.633
Explore all you like
and, you know, rub it with your Johnny Mac

20:10.700 --> 20:13.266
until he feels good and spits up.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.600
But you stay out of the home place...

20:18.300 --> 20:21.300
lest you get locked in
like your mummer and daddy.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.666
[Wilfred] Gotcha.

20:37.133 --> 20:38.266
[Wilfred grunting]

20:38.333 --> 20:39.666
- Get off.
- [groans]

20:41.400 --> 20:42.766
I just wanna go to sleep.

20:43.066 --> 20:44.266
Off you will.

20:45.766 --> 20:46.766
All right.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.233
Nearly there.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.166
[Arlette groans]

20:58.233 --> 20:59.233
[Wilfred] Almost there.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.133
[Arlette grunting]

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
There we go.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.533
She can't say those things about Shannon.

21:53.566 --> 21:55.000
Oh, but she will.

21:58.533 --> 22:00.233
It's just how she is.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.166
And you know that.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.766
Hell, that's how the good Lord made her.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.666
All right?

22:08.733 --> 22:12.066
And she'll split you and Shannon up, too.
I guarantee that.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.566
If we let her.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.300
Couldn't you get your own lawyer?

22:19.633 --> 22:21.566
You think the kind that I can afford...

22:22.633 --> 22:26.233
could stand up to them lawyers
that Farrington would throw at us?

22:28.600 --> 22:30.766
And she'd want that 100 acres, too.

22:32.433 --> 22:34.433
And she means for them to have it.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.033
This is the only way, boy.

22:43.266 --> 22:44.533
But you've got to help me.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
Will you?

22:51.733 --> 22:53.433
I just wish there was another way.

22:57.533 --> 22:58.766
Me, too, son.

22:59.433 --> 23:00.666
[sobbing]

23:02.733 --> 23:03.733
Me, too.

23:07.066 --> 23:08.766
This is our house.

23:09.366 --> 23:11.233
This is where we belong.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.466
Are you willing to fight for it, boy?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.233
Are you willing to fight for it?

23:36.733 --> 23:37.733
Can't you...?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I don't know...

23:41.466 --> 23:42.766
with a pillow or something?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.000
It would be too slow.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.400
Too painful.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.066
She'd struggle.

24:20.433 --> 24:21.566
We'll send her to heaven?

24:22.533 --> 24:24.100
Shh.

24:34.533 --> 24:35.700
[sobs]

24:44.100 --> 24:45.200
It'll be quick.

24:52.666 --> 24:53.666
Come on, boy.

24:55.066 --> 24:56.066
Go on.

24:58.633 --> 24:59.700
Goodbye, Mama.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
Goodbye.

25:12.266 --> 25:14.066
[Arlette] No. [shouting and grunting]

25:17.666 --> 25:20.400
[Wilfred] Hold her down. Hold her down.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.400
Goddamn it.

25:27.466 --> 25:28.666
All right. Get out of here.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.109
- We've gotta move her over.
- [Arlette] Let me go!

25:33.133 --> 25:34.293
[Wilfred] Get out of the way.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.766
[gasping]

25:40.666 --> 25:43.066
[panting]

25:53.666 --> 25:55.700
[Wilfred] In 1922...

25:58.233 --> 26:00.266
I murdered my wife.

26:01.733 --> 26:02.766
My son...

26:04.333 --> 26:06.200
aided me.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.400
[sighs]

26:14.600 --> 26:16.600
This is a thing I regret...

26:18.300 --> 26:20.700
even more bitterly than the crime...

26:22.000 --> 26:24.466
for the reasons
that this document will show.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.066
[Wilfred & Henry grunting]

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
[Wilfred] All right.

26:37.266 --> 26:38.266
Almost there.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.333
That's no grave.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.400
- That's no grave for Mama.
- Boy...

26:47.133 --> 26:48.133
Henry.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.033
Henry.

26:55.666 --> 26:56.666
Boy.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.100
[grunting]

27:08.200 --> 27:09.666
[panting]

27:19.100 --> 27:20.100
Boy?

28:02.300 --> 28:03.400
Okay, darling.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.100
[Wilfred grunts, continues panting]

28:26.533 --> 28:27.533
Come here.

28:28.766 --> 28:30.766
Go on in the house.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.600
Get both wash buckets out of the pantry.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.433
You might as well get them milk buckets
from the barn, too.

28:40.466 --> 28:43.033
Fill them up from the kitchen pump...

28:43.633 --> 28:46.433
and suds them up with that stuff
she keeps in the kitchen.

28:46.666 --> 28:48.066
Under the sink. Go.

28:49.766 --> 28:51.133
Should I heat the water?

28:53.433 --> 28:54.433
No.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.533
Cold water.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.033
It's best for blood.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
Go on.

29:03.600 --> 29:08.333
I discovered something that night
that most people never have to learn.

29:10.466 --> 29:11.633
Murder is sin.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.033
Murder is damnation.

29:16.066 --> 29:18.100
But murder is also work.

29:55.266 --> 29:57.333
I don't think I can go to school today,
Papa.

29:58.266 --> 30:01.033
I think people might see it on my face.
Shannon especially.

30:03.466 --> 30:04.766
You can go to school Monday.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.400
Tell the teacher you had the grippe,

30:08.466 --> 30:10.600
didn't wanna spread it
to the rest of the class.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.300
[Henry breathing heavily]

30:30.500 --> 30:31.533
[sighs]

30:50.033 --> 30:51.033
Oh, shit!

31:05.133 --> 31:06.133
Hey!

31:07.300 --> 31:08.466
Get away from her!

31:33.000 --> 31:36.500
In those days,
all sorts of things happened on farms

31:36.566 --> 31:38.500
out in what we called the middle.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.033
Things that went unremarked,
yet alone reported.

31:46.066 --> 31:47.266
In those days...

31:47.533 --> 31:50.600
a man's wife was considered
a man's business.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.400
And if she disappeared...

31:55.200 --> 31:57.333
well, there was an end to it.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.000
Taking them all would have been a mistake.

32:06.300 --> 32:10.233
She had left on foot
and only taken what she could carry.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.366
Why hadn't she taken the T?

32:19.600 --> 32:22.733
Because I would have heard her start it
and stopped her going.

32:39.766 --> 32:41.000
[grunting]

33:00.000 --> 33:01.566
[car approaching]

33:13.266 --> 33:14.500
Wilfred James?

33:15.400 --> 33:17.133
Andrew Lester. Attorney at law.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.233
Well, before I shake that...

33:23.133 --> 33:26.433
you'd best tell me
whose lawyer you are there, Mr. Lester.

33:28.566 --> 33:31.766
I'm currently being retained
by the Farrington Livestock Company

33:32.033 --> 33:34.133
of Chicago, Omaha and Des Moines.

33:35.333 --> 33:38.400
Well, in that case,
you can just go on and put that hand away.

33:38.466 --> 33:39.466
No offense.

33:40.633 --> 33:41.633
How are you, Lars?

33:42.100 --> 33:43.133
Tolerable fair.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.466
But dry. I could use a drink.

33:44.533 --> 33:46.333
Well, go on. You know where it is.

33:47.033 --> 33:49.233
[Lars] Sweet and cold as ever, I guess.

33:49.666 --> 33:50.700
Mm.

33:50.766 --> 33:52.633
I could use a drink myself, Mr. James.

33:53.233 --> 33:54.266
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.300
Mending fence is hot work.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.533
Not as hot as riding 20 miles
in Lars' truck, though, I'll bet.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.600
Whoo.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.566
My sit-upon may never be the same.
[chuckles]

34:04.633 --> 34:05.733
[chuckles]

34:08.533 --> 34:09.533
[clears throat]

34:12.266 --> 34:14.266
Perhaps we could drink it inside,
Mr. James.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.199
- It would be a little cooler.
- It would,

34:16.266 --> 34:19.033
but I'd no more invite you inside
than I'd shake your hand.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.366
- Hello, Mr. Olsen.
- Henry.

34:32.266 --> 34:35.600
I imagine you're here on business, yeah.
My wife's.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.333
I am.

34:37.632 --> 34:39.333
Well, why would she send you?

34:40.333 --> 34:42.065
Your wife didn't send me, Mr. James.

34:42.132 --> 34:44.065
In point of fact,
I came here to look for her.

34:44.132 --> 34:47.000
Mm. Well, that proves it then.

34:50.565 --> 34:51.565
Proves what?

34:51.600 --> 34:53.632
She absconded, Mr. Lester.

34:54.466 --> 34:55.466
Decamped.

34:56.366 --> 34:57.700
Did a midnight flit.

34:57.766 --> 34:59.333
Whatever you want to call it.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.200
Yep.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.633
But, uh...

35:04.000 --> 35:05.100
I'd have to say...

35:06.033 --> 35:08.433
it sounded to me
like she got as tired of you fellows

35:08.500 --> 35:09.500
as she did of me.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.566
And the son she gave birth to. Good day.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.600
You... You'll pardon me for saying...

35:19.733 --> 35:22.533
but this all seems very strange to me,
Mr. James.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.033
Very strange indeed,

35:24.100 --> 35:27.133
considering the amount of money
my client is willing to pay

35:27.200 --> 35:28.280
for that piece of property.

35:30.266 --> 35:34.000
Let's just say
trying to nail that woman down...

35:34.500 --> 35:37.166
is like trying to nail jelly to the floor.

35:40.366 --> 35:41.533
Could I look in the house?

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
Oh!

35:44.366 --> 35:45.366
Hey, Henry.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.100
Tell this man where's your mama.

35:51.633 --> 35:52.766
I... I don't know, Pa.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.366
Well, don't tell me. Tell him.

35:57.066 --> 35:59.766
Well... you called me out for breakfast
Friday morning...

36:01.233 --> 36:02.100
and that was it.

36:02.166 --> 36:03.533
She was gone. Packed and gone.

36:05.666 --> 36:07.133
Is that the truth, son?

36:08.066 --> 36:09.166
Yes, sir.

36:12.666 --> 36:16.033
Can I go back inside? Got schoolwork
to make up from being sick.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.542
[Wilfred]
Go. Remember it's your turn to milk.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.566
Yes, sir.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.166
This isn't finished.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.333
Did I do it all right, Papa?

36:31.200 --> 36:32.600
You did perfect, son.

36:33.533 --> 36:34.633
Are we gonna get caught?

36:35.200 --> 36:36.200
Are we going to jail?

36:36.466 --> 36:39.100
- When are we gonna fill in the well?
- Not yet.

36:40.766 --> 36:41.766
[Henry] But why?

36:42.166 --> 36:43.033
[Wilfred] You know...

36:43.100 --> 36:46.400
it's only a matter of time
before he brings Sheriff Jones out there.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.166
A filled in well might make him suspicious
about why it got filled in,

36:52.333 --> 36:53.666
so recent and all.

36:55.266 --> 36:57.600
But one that's still being filled in...

36:59.066 --> 37:00.433
And for good reason.

37:07.233 --> 37:08.533
Turn around and watch her ass.

37:10.366 --> 37:11.366
Come on.

37:11.633 --> 37:12.633
That's it. Come on.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.066
- Come on.
- Pa, we can't...

37:23.100 --> 37:24.400
Come on. [grunts]

37:31.066 --> 37:32.066
Now what?

37:34.400 --> 37:35.633
[cow mooing]

37:39.233 --> 37:41.100
[cow continues mooing]

37:44.666 --> 37:46.066
[Henry] Make her stop.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.400
Do something!

37:51.433 --> 37:52.533
[gun cocks]

37:59.633 --> 38:00.633
[sighs]

38:04.000 --> 38:05.300
[Wilfred grunts]

38:14.333 --> 38:15.466
[car approaching]

38:40.366 --> 38:41.366
Good day, gents.

38:43.033 --> 38:44.766
Hard choring this afternoon, is it?

38:46.566 --> 38:48.233
It's my own damn fault.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.333
One of our cows
fell in the old livestock well.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.166
- Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.200
Glass of lemonade, sheriff?

38:57.066 --> 38:58.066
It's Arlette's.

38:58.666 --> 39:00.266
Did she decide to come back now?

39:01.166 --> 39:03.666
No. She took her favorite clothes but...

39:05.033 --> 39:06.133
she left the lemonade.

39:07.066 --> 39:08.100
Henry, go in our house,

39:08.166 --> 39:10.566
- get the... sheriff a glass.
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.033
Come on up, get some shade.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.333
Shade sounds good,
but I believe I'll stand.

39:17.333 --> 39:20.133
Yeah, I guess you know
that I'm not out here on my own hook.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.566
I'm surprised you ain't got Lester
hiding there in the back of your truck.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.133
He wanted to come,
but I put the kibosh on that.

39:27.266 --> 39:30.633
He also said he wanted a search warrant,
but I told him he didn't need one.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.433
I said... you'd either let me look around
or you wouldn't.

39:36.133 --> 39:39.033
I didn't let him in the house
because I took against him.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.566
Of course,
I'd have taken against John Apostle

39:42.633 --> 39:46.000
if he came out here
batting for Cole Farrington's team.

39:50.533 --> 39:51.533
Yep.

39:55.566 --> 39:56.566
Lovely room.

39:59.233 --> 40:00.700
Gets the early light, doesn't it?

40:01.100 --> 40:04.733
Well... stays cool most afternoons,
you know...

40:05.000 --> 40:06.333
Sun's on the other side.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.100
Here you go.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.300
There we go.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.066
- [Jones] Lot of duds.
- [Wilfred] Yeah.

40:14.500 --> 40:18.700
Arlette liked her clothes...
and her mail-order catalogs.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.366
But, uh... since she only took
the one suitcase...

40:22.433 --> 40:24.409
- We've got two. See the other one...
- [Jones] Right.

40:24.433 --> 40:26.473
- ...in the back corner right there?
- [Jones] Yeah.

40:26.766 --> 40:30.600
I'd have to say,
she only took the ones she liked the best.

40:31.233 --> 40:33.100
See, she had two pairs of pants...

40:34.200 --> 40:37.333
and she had... a pair of blue denims...

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
and those are gone.

40:39.166 --> 40:40.166
But, uh...

40:41.033 --> 40:42.566
she didn't much care for pants.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.466
Well, pants are good for traveling in,
though. Aren't they?

40:46.566 --> 40:48.633
Man or woman,
pants are good for traveling in.

40:49.133 --> 40:51.666
A woman might choose them.
If she was in a hurry, that is.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.466
I suppose.

40:57.233 --> 40:58.333
Well, uh...

40:59.433 --> 41:01.166
She did take her good jewelry and, uh...

41:02.100 --> 41:03.600
her picture of Nana and Pop-Pop.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
[Jones] Did she now?

41:06.433 --> 41:08.300
Well, I suppose she would, wouldn't she?

41:09.766 --> 41:10.766
Nice room.

41:12.066 --> 41:13.733
Nice house.
Woman would have to be crazy

41:14.000 --> 41:15.509
to leave a nice room,
a nice house like this one.

41:15.533 --> 41:18.533
Well, uh... Mama always talked
about the city a lot.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.500
Uh, she had this idea
to open up a dress shop.

41:23.633 --> 41:25.466
- Did she?
- Yes, sir.

41:26.366 --> 41:27.366
[chuckles]

41:29.200 --> 41:34.066
But, uh... that would take some money
doing something like that, wouldn't it?

41:34.133 --> 41:36.400
Well, she got them acres from her father.

41:39.733 --> 41:41.933
[Jones] Seems to be a pair
of woman's shoes under there.

41:44.166 --> 41:47.600
Broke in, too.
The kind that'd be good for traveling.

41:48.233 --> 41:51.266
Don't suppose she, uh, ran away barefooty,
do you?

41:52.233 --> 41:53.233
[Wilfred] Hmm.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.200
No, I think she took her canvas shoes.

41:57.433 --> 41:59.633
Anyway, those are the ones that are gone.

42:02.066 --> 42:03.700
Well... [clears throat]

42:08.033 --> 42:10.333
Well, someone must have come along...

42:10.766 --> 42:14.000
picked her up, given her a ride...
before her head cleared.

42:14.066 --> 42:16.300
- That'd be my guess.
- Yep, mine, too. Mine, too.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.700
Well, sheriff...

42:18.066 --> 42:21.633
if we're done in here now...
me and my boy better get back to work.

42:22.700 --> 42:26.733
That useless well should have been
filled in three years ago.

42:27.466 --> 42:30.300
Yeah, an old cow of mine
got out of the barn.

42:30.700 --> 42:31.700
Elphis.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
Her name was Elphis.

42:33.133 --> 42:36.533
She got out of the barn
and decided to take a stroll on the cap.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.633
Yup.

42:37.700 --> 42:40.333
Didn't have the good grace
to die on her own either.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.400
I had to shoot her.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.400
Go on. Come on back, I'll show you.

42:43.466 --> 42:45.100
Right, no, no. Another time.

42:45.166 --> 42:47.500
Thanks for the lemonade
and for being so gracious.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.366
Could've been a lot less so,
considering who sent me here.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.033
Oh, no. It's all right, sheriff.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.500
We all have got our jobs.

43:01.266 --> 43:02.466
He didn't even wanna look.

44:12.400 --> 44:16.633
[Wilfred] If God rewards us on earth
for good deeds...

44:17.233 --> 44:20.500
then maybe Satan rewards us for evil ones.

44:26.566 --> 44:30.466
I can't say for sure,
but that was a good summer.

44:31.100 --> 44:35.166
Plenty of heat and sun for the corn
and just enough rain.

44:35.733 --> 44:37.166
Got a ways to go.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.366
Come to papa.

44:41.533 --> 44:43.033
[laughing]

44:46.600 --> 44:51.733
[Wilfred] Henry wasn't always unsmiling
that summer,

44:52.000 --> 44:56.566
and Shannon Cotterie was the reason why.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.200
Mr. James?

44:58.633 --> 44:59.633
Darling.

45:00.066 --> 45:01.166
Is...?

45:01.233 --> 45:02.433
Is Henry sick?

45:03.033 --> 45:04.033
Sick?

45:04.733 --> 45:06.500
The boy's as healthy as a horse.

45:07.166 --> 45:09.300
He kind of eats like one, too, don't he?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.066
Yeah.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.233
I know. It's just...

45:14.200 --> 45:15.400
[sighs] He's different.

45:16.633 --> 45:19.233
I... I always used to know
what he was thinking, but...

45:19.766 --> 45:21.100
now I don't anymore.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.366
He broods.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.733
- Does he?
- Yeah.

45:27.233 --> 45:28.233
You haven't seen it?

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
Gosh, uh...

45:32.266 --> 45:34.266
he seems like his old self to me.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.433
But he cares for you, Shannon.

45:41.366 --> 45:42.666
An awful lot, darling.

45:43.300 --> 45:49.100
So, maybe what looks like brooding to you
feels like lovesick to him. Hmm?

45:51.066 --> 45:53.333
Yeah. I know, I've thought of that, but...

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Mr. James, if...

45:56.600 --> 46:00.466
If he was, say, sweet on someone else,
one of those girls from school...

46:01.600 --> 46:03.033
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

46:03.466 --> 46:04.466
Shannon...

46:06.466 --> 46:08.366
any summer's a hardworking time.

46:09.333 --> 46:10.500
And with Arlette gone...

46:11.400 --> 46:14.366
me and Hank been busier
than one-armed paper hangers.

46:14.666 --> 46:19.666
So... he hardly has time to spark you,
let alone some other girl.

46:20.733 --> 46:22.400
Yeah. No, I just...

46:24.700 --> 46:26.333
He's so quiet now...

46:26.733 --> 46:27.733
so moody.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.100
Sometimes I have to say his name twice
or even three times

46:32.166 --> 46:34.433
before he hears it and answers.
And I'm trying to...

46:34.766 --> 46:39.366
The only thing you need to worry about
is putting him back in his place

46:39.433 --> 46:40.533
should he get out of it.

46:41.400 --> 46:44.666
Boys...
get pretty steamed up, you know.

46:44.733 --> 46:45.733
Right?

46:47.133 --> 46:48.133
Yeah.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.200
Mr. James...

46:51.700 --> 46:54.466
I'm... I'm real sorry about Mrs. James.

47:16.766 --> 47:19.700
I know you think I'll slip to Shannon
or that sheriff, but...

47:20.633 --> 47:22.266
you don't have to worry about me.

47:22.333 --> 47:25.333
All right now. That's enough now, Henry.
Go to bed.

47:26.266 --> 47:27.266
Hank.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.266
She hated it when you'd call me that.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.333
All right, Hank.

47:39.266 --> 47:40.266
Go to bed.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.266
[cow mooing]

48:09.066 --> 48:11.066
[mooing continues]

48:36.433 --> 48:38.100
[groans then coughs]

48:45.533 --> 48:49.233
[Wilfred] The pipe led to one place
and one place only.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.533
[grunting]

49:10.533 --> 49:12.000
Pa? What happened?

49:15.033 --> 49:17.666
I just thought I heard a fox
trying to get in the barn.

49:17.733 --> 49:18.733
A fox?

49:19.466 --> 49:22.066
- I haven't seen a fox for...
- Back to bed, Hank.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.266
Down in the dark they would die.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.166
If not of suffocation, then...

49:44.700 --> 49:46.000
[scratching]

50:04.166 --> 50:05.433
[scratching stops]

50:16.233 --> 50:19.666
Henry returned from school later that day

50:19.733 --> 50:21.533
and brought with him some news.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.766
[breathing heavily]

50:29.033 --> 50:31.400
She's 15 years old, boy.

50:31.466 --> 50:33.066
Others get married that young.

50:33.466 --> 50:36.600
Christ. I got no money
to give you a start. You understand?

50:37.233 --> 50:40.500
Maybe by '25,
if crops and prices stay good,

50:40.566 --> 50:43.433
- but right now, there ain't nothing...
- There would be enough!

50:43.500 --> 50:47.000
If you hadn't been such a bugger
about that 100 acres, there'd be plenty!

50:49.033 --> 50:50.466
She would've given me some of it.

50:51.433 --> 50:55.233
- She wouldn't have talked to me this way.
- She would've talked to you much worse.

50:55.333 --> 50:56.566
And laughed.

50:59.066 --> 51:00.500
Your mother told you...

51:01.133 --> 51:03.100
to keep your willy in your pants. Hmm?

51:04.266 --> 51:09.100
And although it was as crude and hurtful
as most of what she had to say...

51:09.666 --> 51:12.533
- you should have followed it.
- Mom would've helped me fix it.

51:13.433 --> 51:14.700
Money fixes everything.

51:14.766 --> 51:16.133
[car approaching]

51:21.266 --> 51:22.366
[sighs]

51:22.433 --> 51:24.166
You better make yourself scarce.

51:25.633 --> 51:28.100
You forget how tight your mama was
with a dollar

51:28.166 --> 51:30.200
and you forget too fast for your own good.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.100
I'm gonna do my best for you, son.

51:36.433 --> 51:37.433
You'd better.

51:44.533 --> 51:47.700
[Wilfred] Harlan Cotterie prospered more
than most farmers

51:47.766 --> 51:51.400
in the years 1916 to 1922.

51:52.300 --> 51:54.033
- [Harlan] It's a beast.
- [Wilfred] Mm-hm.

51:54.100 --> 51:56.300
And Harlan had always been good to me.

51:56.700 --> 51:59.433
I'd always considered us
not just neighbors,

51:59.500 --> 52:00.533
but good friends.

52:03.433 --> 52:06.500
Yet in that moment I hated him.

52:07.733 --> 52:10.700
Not because he'd come out to tax me
about my son.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
No.

52:13.433 --> 52:17.233
It was that shiny blue Cadillac he had.

52:18.233 --> 52:20.733
It was the new barn painted bright red.

52:22.266 --> 52:24.000
It was the indoor plumbing.

52:25.400 --> 52:26.633
But most of all...

52:27.233 --> 52:31.433
it was that plain-faced, biddable wife
whose sweetly given reply

52:31.500 --> 52:33.166
to any problem would be:

52:33.233 --> 52:34.733
Whatever you think is best, dear.

52:36.433 --> 52:38.266
[Harlan]
First, and right away, she's gonna go

52:38.333 --> 52:42.200
to the St. Eusebia Catholic Home for Girls
in Omaha.

52:42.266 --> 52:44.706
She doesn't know it yet,
but it's gonna happen. It'll be good.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.466
Sounds like some kind of orphanage.

52:48.566 --> 52:49.600
It's not an orphanage.

52:50.733 --> 52:54.566
It's a clean, wholesome and busy place.

52:54.633 --> 52:55.633
So I've been told.

52:56.133 --> 52:59.500
She'll have chores, get her schooling,
in four months she'll have her baby.

52:59.566 --> 53:02.566
Then we'll give that kid up for adoption,
then she can come home.

53:03.700 --> 53:05.633
What's my part in all this?

53:07.000 --> 53:08.766
I assume I must have one.

53:09.033 --> 53:12.300
Are you smarting on me, Wilf?
Look, I know you've had a tough year,

53:12.366 --> 53:15.566
- but I will not bear you smarting on me.
- I'm not smarting on you,

53:15.633 --> 53:19.133
but you need to know
you're not the only one who's mad...

53:20.700 --> 53:22.000
and ashamed.

53:24.466 --> 53:25.700
Just tell me what you want.

53:28.033 --> 53:29.033
All right.

53:30.666 --> 53:32.300
I know you're not a rich man...

53:33.166 --> 53:36.066
but it's time you step up
and take share of the responsibility.

53:36.133 --> 53:39.100
The time at that home
is gonna cost me $300.

53:40.733 --> 53:42.000
Yeah.

53:44.066 --> 53:46.400
I know you can't get your hands
on $150,

53:46.466 --> 53:48.566
but you better get it on 75.

53:48.666 --> 53:50.133
I can't do that.

53:50.433 --> 53:53.600
Arlette, you know, she cleaned me out
when she left.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.533
Well, take another shortie from the bank.
You paid off that last one already.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.466
I had crop money to pay it back with.
Now I don't.

54:03.266 --> 54:04.366
I've got my land...

54:05.133 --> 54:06.133
I got my house.

54:07.100 --> 54:08.533
And that's pretty much it.

54:09.766 --> 54:11.466
Well, you'd better find it.

54:12.666 --> 54:15.133
Mortgage this house,
if that's what you have to do.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.366
Seventy-five dollars is yours to share.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.100
Compared to your boy changing didies
at the age of 15,

54:20.166 --> 54:21.633
I think you're getting off cheap.

54:22.266 --> 54:24.733
And if I can't find a way, Harl?

54:26.100 --> 54:27.100
What then?

54:31.700 --> 54:32.700
I'm going.

54:36.700 --> 54:38.433
And I'm not come dunning you for it.

54:39.633 --> 54:42.366
- Mm-hm.
- If you don't... you don't.

54:42.433 --> 54:44.500
But don't say you can't
because I know better.

54:50.366 --> 54:53.166
You should've let her sell that acreage
to Farrington, Wilf.

54:54.066 --> 54:55.733
If you'd done that, she'd still be here.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.700
You'd have money in your hand.

55:00.266 --> 55:02.200
And my daughter wouldn't be in the...

55:02.700 --> 55:03.700
family way.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.400
They can't send her away like that.

55:12.466 --> 55:14.333
[Wilfred] Well, they can and they will.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.133
Now, don't think about doing
nothing stupid or headstrong neither.

55:19.133 --> 55:21.366
You'll only make a bad situation worse.

55:24.066 --> 55:25.066
We could run away.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Think about it.

55:30.766 --> 55:34.000
I...
If we could get away with what we did...

55:36.033 --> 55:37.033
Right?

55:43.166 --> 55:44.166
It'd be a shame.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.066
We could get away eloping off to Colorado.

55:48.666 --> 55:49.666
You couldn't...

55:50.200 --> 55:51.433
because you've got no money.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.700
Money fixes everything, right?

55:55.766 --> 55:59.066
As the wife says
no money spoils everything, boy.

55:59.133 --> 56:00.133
I know that.

56:00.700 --> 56:03.766
Shannon will, too, now that she's got
a baby to watch out for now.

56:04.033 --> 56:06.233
- You'll see.
- Not if they make her give it away.

56:09.166 --> 56:10.200
[grunts]

56:12.233 --> 56:13.100
[sighs]

56:13.200 --> 56:17.300
Now, don't change how a woman feels...
when she got a chap in the belly.

56:18.433 --> 56:21.166
You see, a chap makes a woman feel wise...

56:21.366 --> 56:24.433
in ways a man don't understand, son.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.066
Now, I haven't lost any respect for you
just because you gonna have a baby.

56:29.133 --> 56:31.100
Or her. You ain't the first.

56:31.166 --> 56:32.700
You certainly won't be the last.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.500
But you will not... Hey.

56:35.100 --> 56:38.600
You will not ask
a five-month pregnant girl...

56:38.666 --> 56:40.100
to run off with you.

56:44.233 --> 56:46.066
You can't tell me what to do.

56:48.200 --> 56:51.166
You couldn't even cut Mama's throat
without making a mess of it.

56:54.733 --> 56:55.733
I did...

56:57.066 --> 56:58.600
what I did for us.

56:59.666 --> 57:04.633
Now, what good are 180 acres
if I've got no one to pass them on to?

57:09.166 --> 57:10.333
There was another way, Pa.

57:13.233 --> 57:14.233
You know there was.

57:19.700 --> 57:21.066
You cursed it all!

57:22.433 --> 57:23.633
Boy.

57:24.100 --> 57:25.300
You cursed me!

57:26.033 --> 57:27.033
Boy.

57:38.633 --> 57:42.200
He went off to school the next day
without any argument.

57:42.533 --> 57:44.500
Probably because I let him take the T.

57:46.066 --> 57:47.400
Once he was gone,

57:48.400 --> 57:50.000
I started searching.

57:51.566 --> 57:55.233
I wondered if she had socked
a little something away...

57:55.300 --> 58:00.400
just like that story I sold the sheriff.

58:03.500 --> 58:08.600
Each time I found nothing,
I became convinced there was something.

58:58.433 --> 59:02.100
Will Hemingford Home and Trust
loan you 35 dollars?

59:02.566 --> 59:03.566
You bet.

59:04.500 --> 59:07.466
But... you don't need $35.

59:08.633 --> 59:10.766
Oh, I'm sad to say that I do.

59:11.033 --> 59:12.100
No, you don't.

59:12.166 --> 59:15.066
You need 750. That's what you need.

59:15.200 --> 59:18.266
And you could have it today.
And do you wanna tell me

59:18.333 --> 59:21.533
there aren't improvements you could make?
A roof to fix?

59:22.000 --> 59:23.100
A little more livestock?

59:24.166 --> 59:27.233
Maybe even indoor plumbing,
like your neighbor down the road?

59:28.233 --> 59:32.066
You could end up with improvements
that far outweigh the cost of a mortgage.

59:32.133 --> 59:33.366
Value for money, Wilf.

59:33.533 --> 59:34.566
Value for money.

59:37.066 --> 59:39.033
Yeah, this new proposal...

59:40.400 --> 59:41.766
needs a little thinking about.

59:43.566 --> 59:47.700
Well, I ought to talk it over
with my boy, Henry.

59:47.766 --> 59:51.233
Or, uh, Hank,
as he likes to be called now.

59:53.033 --> 59:54.033
Yep.

59:55.133 --> 59:59.266
He's getting to an age
where... he needs to be consulted.

01:00:01.366 --> 01:00:05.500
Well, all I got...
it'll all be his someday.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.760
[Henry] "Papa, I have taken the truck.

01:00:29.733 --> 01:00:31.400
I guess you know where I am going.

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:33.166
Leave me alone.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.700
I know you can send Sheriff Jones after me
to bring me back,

01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:41.633
but if you do I will tell everything.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.066
You might think I'd change my mind
because I am just a kid, but I won't.

01:00:51.466 --> 01:00:53.500
Without Shan, Pa,
I don't care about nothing.

01:01:00.466 --> 01:01:02.433
I love you, Papa,
even if I don't know why

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.566
since everything we did
has brought me misery.

01:01:06.533 --> 01:01:08.666
Your loving son, Henry 'Hank' James."

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:45.733
[Wilfred] Waiting for a teenage boy
to come to his senses

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.233
is like waiting for a broomstick
to sprout flowers.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.533
But what choice did I have?

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.666
I had murdered my wife
to keep my home.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.233
The only way I was leaving it now
would be in chains.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400
[sighs]

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:35.033
Three days ago, in Lyme Biska,
not far from the rider found your truck...

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.100
somebody held up a grocery store
on the edge of town.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.500
Took $23. I got the report on my desk.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.566
Say it was a young fella
wearing old cowboy clothes

01:04:44.633 --> 01:04:46.066
with a bandana over his mouth

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:48.400
and a plainsman's hat
slouched over his eyes.

01:04:54.033 --> 01:04:55.033
[sighs]

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.500
Um, Henry left from school, sheriff...

01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:01.333
and so far as I remember he...

01:05:02.033 --> 01:05:07.766
He had on a flannel shirt that day,
had on some corduroy trousers.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.433
I don't... think
he took any clothes with him, and...

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.600
Anyway, he don't have no cowboy clothes,
if you mean boots and all.

01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:19.600
He don't have no plainsman's hat neither.

01:05:20.566 --> 01:05:24.066
- He could've stolen those, too.
- Now, you don't know anything more

01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:26.166
than what you said,
and you ought to stop.

01:05:26.233 --> 01:05:28.366
All right?
Now, I know your friends with Harlan.

01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:30.700
I know y'all hang at
that Elk's Club or whatever.

01:05:30.766 --> 01:05:32.200
My son is not a robber.

01:05:32.266 --> 01:05:35.633
He don't treat women badly,
he don't be mean to people.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.666
He acts like a normal kid.

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:40.666
And this is not how he was raised either.

01:05:43.433 --> 01:05:45.166
Good day, sheriff.

01:05:48.766 --> 01:05:51.733
Yeah, it's probably just a drifter
looking for a quick payday.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.633
But I felt that I had to bring it up.

01:05:55.133 --> 01:05:57.766
And we don't know how people talk, do we?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200
Talk gets around.

01:05:59.766 --> 01:06:00.766
Talk is cheap.

01:06:01.633 --> 01:06:02.733
[sighs]

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.500
[grunts]

01:06:14.466 --> 01:06:19.066
[Wilfred] Sometimes work is the only thing
to help drive out bad thoughts.

01:06:23.533 --> 01:06:26.366
Fixing a leak would only take
a day or two.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.600
I needed work that would keep me
through the winter.

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:37.733
The next day I took out that mortgage
for $750.

01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:43.500
In the end...

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.200
we all get caught.

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:00.666
[grunting]

01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:33.300
Turn, you son of a...

01:10:34.366 --> 01:10:37.466
Why are you...?

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.066
Come on!

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:29.233
[door creaking]

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.633
[Wilfred grunting]

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.000
[groans]

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.333
[bones crackling]

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.033
[exhales]

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.266
She whispered secrets to me
only a dead woman could know.

01:13:53.766 --> 01:13:54.766
Stay back!

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.366
[inaudible dialogue]

01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:28.566
[Henry] Now! Hurry! Close the door!

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.700
Back up.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.133
We're gonna get you fixed up, all right?

01:15:39.533 --> 01:15:41.366
I'll get some wood.

01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:42.666
I'll make it warm.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.100
I'll make it warm.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.066
It's dead... Henry.

01:15:58.166 --> 01:15:59.433
No more, please.

01:16:02.033 --> 01:16:03.433
Just kill me...

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.533
please.

01:16:06.133 --> 01:16:08.033
Please, just kill me.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.533
Just kill me.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.733
Arlette, please, just kill me.

01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:15.600
Open my throat...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.633
like I opened yours.

01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:22.166
Yeah.

01:16:26.066 --> 01:16:27.133
Please.

01:16:32.366 --> 01:16:37.333
But she wouldn't.
Not till she was satisfied.

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.533
Shannon?

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.500
Shannon.

01:19:33.733 --> 01:19:35.033
[groans]

01:19:44.433 --> 01:19:45.433
Two days ago...

01:19:46.666 --> 01:19:51.133
a farmer on his way to Lyme Biska
noticed something... in a ditch.

01:19:52.133 --> 01:19:53.200
Remains of a woman.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.233
A pair of her back teeth were missing.

01:20:10.733 --> 01:20:13.133
Was Arlette missing a couple
of back teeth?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
When I, uh...

01:20:27.566 --> 01:20:30.433
When I came out that day
just after she ran off...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.700
[sighs]

01:20:32.766 --> 01:20:36.300
your boy mentioned
that she took... her good jewelry

01:20:36.366 --> 01:20:39.666
and you mentioned something about $200.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:40.733
Isn't that right?

01:20:46.266 --> 01:20:47.666
Well, there you go.

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:51.700
She was robbed on the road.

01:20:52.266 --> 01:20:53.600
Some bad egg...

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.100
picked her up, killed her and...

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.466
robbed her of her money and her jewelry.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.733
[sighs]

01:21:23.266 --> 01:21:26.733
[Wilfred]
Henry's body arrived in Hemingford

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
by train on the 18th of December.

01:21:50.233 --> 01:21:54.433
- Mr. James.
- Tell us what happend.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.300
- Mr. James. Mr. James.
- Mr. James.

01:21:56.366 --> 01:21:59.033
- What about your son?
- Describe what you're feeling

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.709
now that your son's body
is back in Hemingford.

01:22:00.733 --> 01:22:03.700
- Mr. James.
- Just give us something to print.

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.133
Mr. James.

01:22:12.466 --> 01:22:13.466
[Wilfred hisses]

01:22:14.033 --> 01:22:15.366
I'm sorry, Mr. James.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.066
Rats got to them.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.000
Got to both of them
before they were found.

01:22:24.666 --> 01:22:25.700
[sniffles]

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.566
[sobbing] Look what they done...

01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:42.633
to my boy.

01:22:44.733 --> 01:22:45.733
You...

01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:49.166
fix him up.

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.333
Mr. James, sir...

01:22:53.633 --> 01:22:56.366
- the damage is...
- Yeah. I can see what the damn damage is.

01:22:56.433 --> 01:22:58.233
You fix him up, get him off this...

01:22:59.633 --> 01:23:01.033
- Sir...
- ...plate here

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.700
and put him in a coffin.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.033
A fine coffin.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.133
Your finest coffin.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.733
- Yes, sir.
- I got money.

01:23:12.766 --> 01:23:14.166
Certainly, Mr. James.

01:23:14.533 --> 01:23:16.000
Now, you cover him up now.

01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:31.366
My boy.

01:23:37.566 --> 01:23:38.566
All right.

01:23:45.133 --> 01:23:46.133
What...

01:23:48.466 --> 01:23:49.600
I got money, so...

01:23:52.133 --> 01:23:53.166
Whatever it takes.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:24:02.000
No father should have to kiss his son
for the last time...

01:24:04.266 --> 01:24:07.033
but if any father deserved such a fate...

01:24:08.533 --> 01:24:09.533
it was I.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:13.500
[man] "You believe in God,
believe also in me.

01:24:14.533 --> 01:24:17.600
Do not let your heart be troubled.

01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:20.166
Believe in God...

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.300
believe also in me.

01:24:25.033 --> 01:24:28.166
In my father's house
are many dwelling places.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.266
If it were not so,
I would have told you.

01:24:33.566 --> 01:24:34.733
And the way you know..."

01:24:35.033 --> 01:24:38.033
[Wilfred] The attendance was much smaller
for Henry.

01:24:38.433 --> 01:24:40.400
"If I go and prepare a place for you

01:24:40.466 --> 01:24:43.366
I will come again
and receive you to myself.

01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:48.133
That where I am
there you may be also.

01:24:48.466 --> 01:24:51.333
And you know the way where I go..."

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Um...

01:26:43.633 --> 01:26:44.733
Now, just hear me out.

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:47.666
Um...

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.200
I wanna sell you my 100 acres.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.500
That's good land, Harl.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:02.766
Hard times, huh?

01:27:03.766 --> 01:27:05.100
[chuckles]

01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:09.433
Half your house and half your barn
all caved in.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.400
Hermie Gordon says you even got a cow
living in there with you.

01:27:15.466 --> 01:27:17.300
[laughing]

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600
[sighs]

01:27:22.066 --> 01:27:23.066
Nonetheless...

01:27:24.533 --> 01:27:26.000
I wanna give you that land...

01:27:27.733 --> 01:27:29.033
for $500.

01:27:32.733 --> 01:27:34.700
Arlette's rolling in her grave.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.100
[grunts]

01:27:41.266 --> 01:27:42.700
Sallie left me.

01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:48.633
I don't think she's coming back.

01:27:49.566 --> 01:27:50.666
[grunts]

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.433
Called me a self-righteous fool
and she's right.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.266
We're in that same broke wagon.

01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:07.366
Two men who started the year with wives...

01:28:09.066 --> 01:28:10.633
ending the year without them.

01:28:12.766 --> 01:28:13.766
[Harlan laughs]

01:28:14.733 --> 01:28:17.266
Two men started the year
with living children...

01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:24.366
ended the year with dead ones.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.400
I still got both my hands.

01:28:36.033 --> 01:28:37.566
That's something, I suppose.

01:28:37.633 --> 01:28:38.733
[groans]

01:28:41.633 --> 01:28:42.666
[sighs]

01:28:44.633 --> 01:28:46.133
That land's cursed.

01:28:48.433 --> 01:28:49.600
Sell it to the bank.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.600
Well, now...

01:28:52.466 --> 01:28:53.466
See, uh...

01:28:55.066 --> 01:28:57.300
they'd just turn around
and sell it to Farrington.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200
Harl...

01:29:01.366 --> 01:29:02.500
that stream there...

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.433
they'd be filling up with blood...
hog intestines.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.300
That's your stream, too, Harl.

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.033
And all I ask is...

01:29:15.066 --> 01:29:16.500
they don't get their hands on it.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Not...

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.600
Not them.

01:29:24.166 --> 01:29:25.166
Wilf...

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.566
don't come back here ever.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.633
[sobs]

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:07.366
[cow mooing]

01:30:31.366 --> 01:30:33.233
What the hell happened to you, girl?

01:30:57.666 --> 01:30:58.666
[gun cocks]

01:31:03.266 --> 01:31:04.266
[grunts]

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.466
All right, girl.

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:13.466
Take it easy.

01:31:16.133 --> 01:31:17.533
All right, easy now.

01:31:18.133 --> 01:31:19.166
Shh.

01:31:22.033 --> 01:31:24.266
It's all right. Easy now.

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.666
Shh.

01:31:27.333 --> 01:31:28.333
Okay.

01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:30.000
Almost over.

01:31:31.633 --> 01:31:32.666
[sighs]

01:31:34.366 --> 01:31:35.366
Okay, girl.

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.266
It's nearly over.

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.366
Shh.

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.333
It's okay.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.400
It's okay.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:50.400
Shh. [gun cocks]

01:31:54.533 --> 01:31:55.533
[gunshot]

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.100
[grunts]

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.533
That was the end of 1922.

01:32:32.366 --> 01:32:34.333
I lost the farm, of course.

01:32:35.233 --> 01:32:37.300
When the hog-butchers finally swooped in,

01:32:37.366 --> 01:32:40.666
I was forced to sell
at an insanely low price.

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.566
Harlan Cotterie hung on
till about '25 or so...

01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:02.366
and then the bank took his farm.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.633
I went to Omaha.

01:33:08.033 --> 01:33:09.333
A city of fools...

01:33:10.633 --> 01:33:13.166
and I hauled pallets for 14 months.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.166
The only reason I stopped?

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.733
Whenever I tried to busy myself with work,
to keep out the thoughts...

01:33:32.133 --> 01:33:33.333
they'd find me.

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:51.066
Took me two solid years
to drink up Arlette's hundred acres.

01:33:59.666 --> 01:34:01.233
When I wasn't drinking...

01:34:06.466 --> 01:34:11.533
I visited the places that Henry had been
during the last month of his life.

01:34:14.333 --> 01:34:15.433
Can I help you, sir?

01:34:16.533 --> 01:34:18.666
There was a robbery here, uh...

01:34:20.033 --> 01:34:22.000
oh, about two years back.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.700
You wouldn't happen to know
about nothing like that?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.233
Well, that was my son.

01:34:40.266 --> 01:34:41.433
Henry was right.

01:34:43.466 --> 01:34:45.300
There was another way.

01:34:47.466 --> 01:34:48.733
There always is.

01:34:52.133 --> 01:34:54.233
But in 1922...

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.166
the conniving man
inside farmer Wilfred James...

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.066
had begged to differ.

01:35:17.433 --> 01:35:19.433
[Henry] But I can't pray now
or ever again.

01:35:20.766 --> 01:35:23.633
If I got down on my knees,
I think God would strike me dead.

01:35:28.466 --> 01:35:30.033
I hope there is no God.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.033
I imagine all murderers hope there isn't.

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.366
Because if there's no heaven,
there's no hell.

01:35:41.166 --> 01:35:42.166
[Wilfred] Son...

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:46.433
...I was the one...

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600
who killed her.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.200
[Henry] No, Pa.

01:35:56.333 --> 01:35:57.433
We did it together.

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.380
[Wilfred] All right, Hank.

01:36:05.033 --> 01:36:07.633
I love you... son.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600
[Henry] I know.

01:36:15.033 --> 01:36:16.400
But I don't much deserve it.

01:36:38.066 --> 01:36:39.100
[inaudible]

01:36:42.666 --> 01:36:43.700
Papa...

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.666
it'll be quick.

01:36:56.266 --> 01:36:57.700
[sobbing]

01:37:06.566 --> 01:37:07.700
[Wilfred] In the end...

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.166
we all get caught.
