<i> YEAH.</i>

37:46.647 --> 37:48.430
<i> YEAH, YOU DIDN'T MEAN</i>
<i> TO GIVE THOSE NAMES UP,</i>

37:48.433 --> 37:49.499
DID YA?

37:50.335 --> 37:52.819
<i> I KNOW.</i>

37:52.820 --> 37:55.304
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HE WORKED FOR, RIGHT?

37:55.307 --> 37:57.407
<i> ED:</i>
<i> DONNA, HE IS GONNA FACE</i>
<i> JUSTICE,</i>

37:57.409 --> 37:59.009
BUT WE HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.311
YOU SHOT MY HUSBAND -

38:01.313 --> 38:03.413
IN THE BACK, BILL.
IN THE BACK.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.865
DO YOU REMEMBER
DOING THAT?!

38:04.866 --> 38:06.316
KEDRICK:
I DID THAT FOR YOU!
I DID IT TO SAVE YOU!

38:06.318 --> 38:08.451
<i> DONNA:</i>
<i> WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!</i>

38:08.453 --> 38:11.921
AFTER YOU LEFT,
THEY PUT A GUN IN MY HAND.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.423
THEY TOLD ME
I WAS THE ONLY ONE

38:13.425 --> 38:16.026
WHO COULD GET
YOUR HUSBAND ALONE;

38:16.027 --> 38:18.628
THAT HE HAD TO DIE.
THAT'S WHAT LOGAN WANTED.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.063
LOGAN'S ALREADY DEAD.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.731
WASN'T HIM.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.433
IT WAS IDA,
IT WAS HIS WIFE.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.435
SHE WANTED THE HIT.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.471
<i> NOT AT THE COPS,</i>
<i> BUT AT THEIR FAMILIES.</i>

38:28.473 --> 38:31.308
<i>THEY TOLD ME IF I DIDN'T DO IT,</i>
<i> IF I WENT TO THE COPS,</i>

38:31.310 --> 38:33.943
THAT THEY WOULD KILL YOU.

38:33.945 --> 38:37.747
I COULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN,
DONNA.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.983
I'M SORRY.
(CRIES PITIFULLY)

38:41.720 --> 38:42.852
I'M SO SORRY.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.057
NO!
(FIRES WEAPON)

38:47.059 --> 38:48.792
NO.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.526
HIS GUN'S DOWN,
HE'S NOT A THREAT.

38:50.529 --> 38:51.861
<i> YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER.</i>
<i> GET BACK, GUYS.</i>

38:51.863 --> 38:53.780
I DON'T CARE WHAT I AM.

38:53.781 --> 38:55.698
ED:
GIVE HER SOME ROOM.
DONNA, YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER.

38:55.701 --> 38:56.700
I WANNA KILL HIM.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.002
DONNA,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.470
<i> COME ON NOW.</i>

39:00.471 --> 39:01.937
<i> DONNA:</i>
<i> YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED</i>
<i> TO CONTRADICT ME, ED.</i>

39:01.940 --> 39:04.007
DON'T CONTRADICT ME.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.342
<i> I WANNA KILL HIM.</i>

39:05.344 --> 39:07.377
DONNA...
I WANNA KILL HIM.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.913
DONNA, COME ON NOW.
I HEAR YOU'RE ANGRY,

39:09.915 --> 39:12.916
BUT SHOOTING HIM'S
NOT GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.517
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.785
<i> DONNA:</i>
<i> I DON'T WANNA THINK, ED.</i>

39:18.457 --> 39:19.273
SHUT UP!

39:19.274 --> 39:20.090
<i> ED:</i>
<i> CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK?</i>

39:20.092 --> 39:22.492
I THINK THAT MAN RIGHT THERE,

39:22.494 --> 39:24.894
THAT YOU ONCE LOVED
AND ADMIRED,

39:24.896 --> 39:27.430
I THINK THAT NO MATTER
HOW FAR HE'S FALLEN,

39:27.432 --> 39:29.933
NO MATTER WHAT
HE'S BEEN THROUGH,

39:29.934 --> 39:32.435
HE IS STILL THE MAN
THAT MADE YOU WHO YOU ARE TODAY.

39:32.437 --> 39:33.903
NOW, YOU SHOOT HIM, DONNA,
IT'S OVER.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.705
<i> YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.</i>

39:35.707 --> 39:37.140
<i> YOU WILL NEVER HAVE</i>
<i> THE LIFE YOU WANT. </i>

39:37.142 --> 39:39.126
<i> DONNA:</i>
<i> BUT I...</i>

39:39.127 --> 39:41.111
<i> YOU KNOW THE LIFE I WANTED</i>
<i> AND HE TOOK IT AWAY.</i>

39:41.113 --> 39:43.113
AND WHAT DO I HAVE NOW?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.416
<i> ED:</i>
<i> THAT'S UP TO YOU.</i>

39:46.418 --> 39:49.018
<i> THAT'S UP TO YOU.</i>
<i> IT ALWAYS IS, COME ON.</i>

39:49.020 --> 39:50.086
IT'S OKAY.

39:51.523 --> 39:54.557
<i> KEDRICK:</i>
<i> I DID IT FOR YOU, DONNA.</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:57.527
<i> DONNA:</i>
<i> I HATE YOU!</i>
<i> (SOBS)</i>

39:57.529 --> 39:59.729
I HATE YOU.
(ANGUISHED SOBS)

40:02.467 --> 40:05.435
ED:
COME ON, IT'S OKAY.
(MURMURING COMFORTING WORDS)

40:05.437 --> 40:07.771
DONNA:
(ANGUISHED SOBS)

40:17.516 --> 40:19.516
DONNA, IT'S HANK.
HE'S ASKING FOR YOU.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.151
DONNA:
WHAT?

40:21.153 --> 40:22.419
OH.

40:36.435 --> 40:46.543

41:38.597 --> 41:40.096
HOW'S HANK DOING?

41:40.098 --> 41:41.264
HE'S GONNA PULL THROUGH.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.810
GOOD.

41:42.811 --> 41:44.355
SO MUCH FOR THE HONEYMOON.

41:44.356 --> 41:45.900
<i> SAM:</i>
<i> YOU REALLY THINK </i>
<i> SHE'LL LEAVE TEAM THREE?</i>

41:45.904 --> 41:47.270
WE'LL SEE HOW SHE FEELS
AFTER FOUR WEEKS

41:47.272 --> 41:49.939
OF DOING NOTHING ALL DAY.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.142
I MEAN, SHE CAN'T GIVE UP
THAT EASY.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.210
NO.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.019
SO, HYPOTHETICALLY,
YOU EVER THINK OF A HONEYMOON?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.621
LOVE A HONEYMOON,
HYPOTHETICALLY.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.622
ALL RIGHT,
JUST PROMISE ME

42:05.624 --> 42:07.924
IT'S NOT DAIQUIRIS
ON THE BEACH.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.659
EXTREME HIKING,
REMOTE TRAILS,

42:09.661 --> 42:10.660
NO OUTHOUSES.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.529
NICE! I LIKE IT.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.830
OH, YOU MEAN WITH YOU?
