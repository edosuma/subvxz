00:01.543 --> 00:04.922
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:08.175
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.428
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:14.389
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.057 --> 00:18.268
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.438
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.858
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:36.620
<i>Wide open in the end zone.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:37.996
<i>Touchdown, Patriots.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.957
<i>- Beautiful pass by Tom Brady.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.334
- Yeah, Brady!
- He's awesome.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.170
I can't believe Gisele
gets to sleep with him.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.797
I wish I was a supermodel.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.965
Hey, it's a commercial.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.675
Jerome, switch it over to the <i>RedZone.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:51.635
Screw that. I say, we put on
the <i>Bone Zone.</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:53.220
- What's that?
- Oh, it's awesome.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.264
They show every sex scene on TV

00:55.347 --> 00:57.724
without all the boring dialogue and plot.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.186
<i>Okay, once again,</i>
<i>nothing's happening on</i> Homeland.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.563
<i>But over on</i> Masters of Sex,

01:02.646 --> 01:04.356
<i>Lizzy Caplan is hooked up to electrodes</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:07.693
<i>and gettin' it from a guy who</i>
<i>sounds American, but probably isn't.</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:09.236
<i>Hey, we're gonna split the screens now,</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:10.404
<i>because my producer is telling me</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:12.823
<i>on</i> Game of Thrones,
<i>we got a malnourished albino</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:15.742
<i>plowing a girl in a tub as</i>
<i>he names dragons.</i>

01:15.826 --> 01:19.371
<i>Oh, there's a</i> Bone Zone <i>Alert</i>
<i>for</i> Girls, <i>which we'll ignore.</i>

01:19.454 --> 01:21.456
<i>'Cause it's Gaby Hoffmann</i>
<i>Donald-Ducking it.</i>

01:21.540 --> 01:24.209
<i>Last time we went to that,</i>
<i>we lost a lot of subscribers.</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:25.544
<i>And we're keepin' an eye on</i> The Knick.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.712
<i>We don't want to bring you dead boobs,</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:29.131
<i>but if they're alive,</i>
<i>we'll get you over there.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:32.718
Oh, crap. It's almost 3:00.
I gotta get out of here.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.052
For what? It's Sunday.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.014
The airline's makin' us all attend
a seminar about what to do

01:37.097 --> 01:39.057
if someone flies a drone
into your flight path.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.768
Yeah, I hear that kind
of obnoxious behavior is very big

01:41.852 --> 01:43.812
right now in the
<i>Dangerous Idiot</i> community.

01:43.896 --> 01:46.148
Really? I didn't see that
in the newsletter this month.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.025
Just a big article about how to tailgate

01:48.108 --> 01:50.903
a speeding fire truck to get
places faster.

01:53.030 --> 01:57.409
Wait till I get to the golf
course and find out there's no fire.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.785
No, it's a serious problem.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.663
Nowadays any moron
can just order a drone online.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.248
- Oh.
- There's no regulation.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.416
Oh!

02:04.499 --> 02:07.252
And most of them have cameras so
people can spy on whoever they want

02:07.336 --> 02:10.214
- and invade their privacy.
- Oh!

02:10.297 --> 02:12.257
Peter, are you ordering a drone right now?

02:12.341 --> 02:16.094
You bet your ass I am.
Ownin' a drone is gonna be a blast.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.680
Even more fun
than when I had breakfast in bread.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.769
Hi, Lois, it's a great morning.
No matter how you slice it.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.604
I don't know what this is, Peter,

02:25.687 --> 02:27.856
but we're four months behind
on our mortgage.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.984
Well, that's odd.
It's not like we're short on dough.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.112
I'm taking the kids and I'm staying
at my parents for a while.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.740
That's the yeast of my concerns.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.957
Oh, Brian, you finally made it.
I'm having a tea party, sit down.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.750
Yeah, you texted me, like, 80 times.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.794
Look, Stewie, I don't have time to sip air

02:48.877 --> 02:50.879
and pretend to eat
a wooden hamburger patty.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.173
Yeah? Tell me why you don't have time.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.592
All right, I have time.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.386
And there's nothing pretend about this.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.972
Real tea, real milk, and the best honey

03:00.055 --> 03:01.807
you'll ever taste in your whole life.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.310
Wow, this is good.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.938
- Where'd you buy the honey?
- I didn't, I'm raising bees.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.983
You're raising bees? Like a beekeeper?

03:11.066 --> 03:14.695
Yup. Mom missed soccer registration,
so this is my weekends.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.364
Mmm. I gotta say, you're good at it.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.116
You know,
you could probably sell this stuff.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.659
Really? You think it's that good?

03:20.742 --> 03:23.370
Yeah, plus it's local,
it's straight from the hive.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.789
People at farmers' markets
would go nuts for this.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.667
You know, you could
probably charge, like, $20-30 a jar.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.502
Now I'm excited about this, Brian.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.547
I feel like an eighth grader who
just had sex.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.966
- So, you go all the way?
- Oh, yeah.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.551
I'm gonna need some proof.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.889
Hmm. How can I prove it?
Maybe with Father O'Leary's briefs.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.141
- Oh!
- The king.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.810
He said he loved me.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.693
All right, time to take flight,
Drone of Arcadia.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.154
- Oh, Amber Tamblyn.
- I love that show.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.198
Now married to David Cross.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.454
<i>- Can I have a turn? I want a turn.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

04:05.537 --> 04:07.206
<i>Hey, does Cleveland have a bald spot?</i>

04:07.289 --> 04:09.208
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Hey, what's this do?</i>

04:29.645 --> 04:31.355
<i>Check it out. Here comes a hawk.</i>

04:36.610 --> 04:38.987
Uh-oh. What's happening?

04:39.071 --> 04:40.405
- <i>Argh!</i>

04:40.489 --> 04:42.991
<i>No, I don't think this is consensual!</i>

04:43.075 --> 04:45.369
<i>Look at that pervert squirrel</i>
<i>just watching.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:56.255
Oh, crap, it's busted.
And I bet it's completely traumatized.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.216
I wasn't traumatized actually,
it was planned.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.385
Part of the games we play.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.179
I've been a bad drone.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.477
Peter, you've been knockin' a while.
I don't think anyone's in there.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.189
Yeah, look at all this mail.
Maybe he's on vacation or something.

05:17.568 --> 05:21.280
Oh, my God, he's dead.
And his face and earlobes are missing!

05:23.866 --> 05:27.744
Oh, that's a relief. It's just the cat
that ate his face and ears off.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.294
So, Brian, this is my hive.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.045
Now how many bees
do you think are in here?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.589
I don't know, a million?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.257
No, it's 4,000.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.177
Now that seems like nothing
because of your idiot million guess.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.430
All right, now, if you're going
to sell honey at the farmers' market,

05:46.513 --> 05:47.681
you need to practice.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.434
So you be the salesman
and I'll be the customer.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.603
Ooh, what do we have here?

05:52.686 --> 05:55.147
Uh, honey, like the sign says.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.358
I find your attitude cavalier.
May I speak to your manager?

05:58.442 --> 05:59.484
Stewie, come on.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.819
I'm sorry, is there a problem here?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.571
I was just in the back
and I heard a commotion.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.655
How do we have a back?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.908
I simply came here to inquire about honey

06:05.991 --> 06:08.827
and your employee spoke to me loudly
and with profanity.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.162
Stewie, this is ridiculous.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.582
Brian, please. I trust that
this handsome young customer knows

06:13.665 --> 06:14.708
what he's talking about.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.045
Oh, my. And I thought
only bees pour on the honey.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.129
I'm goin' inside.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.631
So, are you from around here?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.966
No, I'm just in town
for the John Singer Sargent exhibit

06:23.050 --> 06:24.051
at the museum.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.054
Really? I've been looking
for an excuse to go again.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.348
Well, looks like I won't need
that audio tour.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.725
Great. Give me one minute,
let me text my fiancÃ©.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.310
Your what?

06:38.065 --> 06:41.360
That was Bonnie. She said they already
sold the house behind us.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.694
Poor Mr. Seagull.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.614
What the hell is that?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.705
Oh, God. Please don't let that be
our new neighbors.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.999
- What is it?
- Some kind of crazy van

06:56.083 --> 06:58.043
with the number 87 on the side.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.295
Eighty seven?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.048
That's not a van, Lois.
That's a party bus.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.717
Rob Gronkowski's party bus!

07:05.801 --> 07:06.802
Who's that?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.054
Only the star tight end
of the New England Patriots

07:09.137 --> 07:11.139
and America's most athletic Polish.

07:13.392 --> 07:16.520
- Did you guys see?
- Oh, my God! That was Rob Gronkowski.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.697
Am I running? Is this what running is?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.575
- I hate it.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.664
What's up, butt munchers?

07:35.873 --> 07:38.000
That's us! He called us "butt munchers."

07:38.083 --> 07:40.919
- We're butt munchers.

07:41.003 --> 07:44.047
All right. Time to Gronk a dump
in my new house.

07:44.840 --> 07:49.803
Oh, my God. Our new neighbor is Gronk.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.388
Hey, I'm your new mailman.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.516
Former star of <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>
Lou Ferrigno.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.768
On any other day, that would
be so exciting.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.687
Please give me my mail and go.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.779
What the hell are you doing?

08:07.863 --> 08:10.574
I wanted to bring over something
to welcome Gronk to the neighborhood.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.785
So I scraped all the cool ranch
off of 15 bags of Doritos.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.537
You're bringin' him a bowl of powder?

08:15.621 --> 08:18.540
Yeah, I thought he could eat it
by the fistful or rub it on his balls.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.751
Peter, I don't know
what you're so excited about.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.129
Rob Gronkowski is probably
the worst neighbor we could ask for.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.632
You know he's gonna be partying
day and night.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.717
It's not like it's that tasty
piece of ass,

08:28.800 --> 08:29.927
Julian Edelman.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.804
Now there's a Patriot
you can get excited about.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.517
I know he's a wide receiver
but if he's givin', I'm takin'.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.144
I'll take it all, I'll take it wherever.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.647
Ah!

08:42.064 --> 08:45.734
Anyway, go suck up
to your big dumb monster.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.695
I'll be here hooking the G
to thoughts of Edelman.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.620
- So what did you get him, Cleveland?
- Oreo middles.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.207
- Whoa! Four standing dogs?
- No, we're people, sir.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.919
Um, Mr. Gronk, I'm Peter Griffin,
I live in the house behind yours.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.754
We wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

09:05.838 --> 09:06.964
Awesome.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.299
-You spiked it.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.635
- I was hopin' he would do that.
- My eyes!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.136
Hey, you guys seem great.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.305
You wanna come in
and eat pizza standin' up?

09:15.389 --> 09:17.140
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.977
You mind if I call you all "Grover"?
I don't like learning names.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.311
Yeah, sure, that'd be sweet.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.606
- Well, come on in, Grover.
-He knows my name!

09:28.151 --> 09:29.236
Oh, my God, you guys.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.530
Havin' Gronk here is gonna be the best.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.241
Kind of like those years
when it was just Marley and me.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.287
Hey, my dog's chewin' up that thing
I need.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.707
Hey, my dirty dog
is jumpin' in the neighbor's pool.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.168
Wait, Marley, don't shake your wet fur

09:44.251 --> 09:46.211
in the middle of this fancy party.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.630
I'm gonna lay down
these work blueprints on the floor,

09:48.714 --> 09:51.925
and I sure hope you don't
walk across them with muddy paws.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.261
Marley!

09:54.761 --> 09:57.639
Oh, my nightmare dog is dead.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.183
<i>Marley & Me.</i>

10:03.228 --> 10:04.688
Workout room.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.231
Kegerator cellar.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.858
Another workout room.

10:07.941 --> 10:12.487
And over here's a room that's just
got a lit candle on a bale of hay.

10:12.571 --> 10:16.241
- Is that just 'cause of the danger?
- That's exactly why.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.203
My dumb wife won't let me
have a room like that.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.288
- Do you have a wife?

10:25.167 --> 10:26.210
What's goin' on?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.628
Let's go check out the hot tub.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.303
Check it out,
my hot tub is filled with coffee.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.806
Grab a donut, go to town.
Sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.685
And the pool is filled with
my favorite food.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.897
Soup with little shapes in it.
Sponsored by Campbell's Soup.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.733
Oh, alphabet soup is my favorite too.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.193
What's a albaphet?

10:51.276 --> 10:53.487
Nothing. What you said is not anything.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.655
And check out the shower.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.082
My manager said if I don't,
I won't go to heaven.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.335
Sponsored by SMS Audio
sweat-proof sport headphones.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.634
Well, you were right.
The farmers' market is wonderful.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.594
You've got your yoga-pants moms,

11:17.678 --> 11:19.221
you've got your mixed-race kids

11:19.304 --> 11:21.974
riding a pony, a confused Jerome.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.185
What is this, a vegetable parking lot?

11:25.269 --> 11:28.438
Now remember to tell customers
that this honey is farm-to-table.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.524
We're not a restaurant,
that doesn't make any sense.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.860
Doesn't have to.
Say "anything-to-anything,"

11:32.943 --> 11:34.194
people lose their minds.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.489
Just so you know,
this is all grass-to-bottle.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.659
- Ooh.
- I know, right? That'll be $68.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.913
- Is this a super food?
- Total super food. Full of GMOs.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.374
- GMOs are bad.
- No GMOs whatsoever.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.876
Amazing.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.254
Wow, this is great.
We've only been here an hour

11:52.337 --> 11:53.797
and we're almost totally sold out.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.465
Yes, I didn't see that coming.

11:55.549 --> 11:59.928
Just like Dan Cortese
didn't see the end of the '90s coming.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.973
Three, two, one!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.600
Happy New Year!

12:08.979 --> 12:12.024
Dan Cortese was the only thing
in the entire world

12:12.107 --> 12:14.067
affected by Y2K.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.326
Grovers, you made it. Here, have a beer.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.785
Thanks. Hey, Gronk,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.579
you know, there's something
I always wanted to ask you.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.289
When you know you have single coverage,

12:27.372 --> 12:30.167
do you give a hand signal to Brady
or is it just eye contact?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.628
I don't know, wanna see me dance?

12:32.711 --> 12:35.756
Well, I ask, because sometimes
you're being covered by a little guy,

12:35.839 --> 12:38.008
and then you and Brady
will look at each other, and...

12:38.091 --> 12:40.052
Am I... Am I supposed to touch you?

12:40.135 --> 12:42.054
What am I... What am I doing here?

12:42.137 --> 12:44.223
Oh, I'm sorry, bro, what was the question?

12:44.306 --> 12:45.641
I just want to know if you and Brady

12:45.724 --> 12:48.018
have, like, a secret hand signal
or something?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.605
Whoa, that is top secret,
but lean in, and I'll tell you.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.400
How rude.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.445
Hey, wanna meet my family?
These are my brothers.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.114
Actually, one of them is my dad.
I'm not sure which.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.159
Probably the gray-haired one
with the whiskey face sunburn.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.454
Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.
You must be very proud.

13:07.538 --> 13:11.708
Hell yeah. I think every dad's dream
is takin' his son's sloppy seconds.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.544
Is your mom here too?

13:13.627 --> 13:14.711
They don't have a mom.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.880
My ex-wife raised them, God bless her.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.592
But genetically, they're a product
of me blammin' on to a side of beef.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.181
All right, since we sold out so fast,

13:26.265 --> 13:27.975
we gotta make
these bees more productive.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.769
- Get them to make more honey.
- How're we gonna do that?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.104
Steroids, Brian.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.564
This here is the same stuff

13:33.647 --> 13:36.859
that turned Barry Bonds' head
into a prize-winning squash.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.902
Okay, well, how much
are we supposed to give them?

13:38.986 --> 13:42.114
Hmm. It says this is enough for a horse.
So...

13:42.656 --> 13:44.408
I don't know, how many bees is a horse?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.494
Boy, you can't fit a horse in this box,
so I'd just use the whole thing.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.371
That makes sense.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.003
Barry Bonds says that's too much steroids.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.629
Time for bed, Barry.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.391
God, they're still goin'?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.977
Peter, this is exactly
what I told you would happen.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.354
- Not so much fun anymore, is it?

14:14.438 --> 14:16.273
Oh, thank God,
maybe they're wrappin' it up.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.109
Noise! Noise!

14:19.193 --> 14:22.237
Loud noise, noise, and a Civil War cannon.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.992
Damn it, I can't take any more!
He is the worst neighbor ever.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.369
You won't believe what he did yesterday.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.039
Hey, Grover, catch.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.929
Uh, listen, Gronk, um,
it's gettin' kind of late.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.640
Don't you think
maybe it's time to call it a night?

14:49.723 --> 14:52.476
Yeah, sure.
Hey, you ever seen a nard explode?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.436
A what? A "nard"?

14:54.728 --> 14:58.148
I don't... Is that something
on the Internet? 'Cause I...

14:58.232 --> 15:00.609
- Oh, damn it, what the hell!

15:00.692 --> 15:01.985
Nice shot there.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.488
Come on, don't get mad, bro.
I was just kidding.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.782
You were kidding? What was the joke?

15:06.865 --> 15:09.493
- This was.
- Oh, damn it, you hit the seam.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.120
- Oh! Yeah.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.414
You know what? You're a jerk, Gronk.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.167
That's it. I'm getting rid
of that bastard.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.795
Just like I helped
kick the British out of America.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.047
This tyranny shall not stand.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.799
For without liberty...

15:23.882 --> 15:26.009
Oh, crap, he's even in the cutaways.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.055
Just... Just go to commercial.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.016
I'm gonna squat here
and hold on to this bench.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.193
Peter, you gotta figure somethin' out.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.654
They haven't stopped partying
the whole night.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.822
- Yeah!
- Gronk!

15:46.905 --> 15:48.657
- Party!
- On the deck.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.994
I'm sorry, you were right all along.
But don't worry, I'll take care of it.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.997
Well, you better do something soon.
I can't live like this.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.833
I know. That guy's more annoying
than going to an Italian restaurant

15:57.916 --> 15:59.751
with someone who's been to Italy.

15:59.835 --> 16:03.755
They call this a trattoria?
More like a <i>ristorante</i> to me.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.342
Look at that fresco.
Supposed to be the hills of Elba.

16:07.426 --> 16:08.677
Not once you've seen 'em.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.679
- Are you ready to order?
<i>- Si.</i>

16:10.762 --> 16:14.308
Let me handle this, Peter.
Two spaghettis and a chicken fingers.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.481
God, look at all the honey the bees made.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.525
Those steroids were a great idea, Stewie.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.236
Hey, look, that bee's trying
to get our honey.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.489
Okay, Mr. Bee, we'll give you
the employee discount.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.241
After all you... Oh!

16:31.325 --> 16:34.203
Holy crap, that thing
just lifted a whole jar of honey.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.497
Oh, God. Do you think
that's one of our steroid bees?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.877
Well, this one's wearing
a hoodie as a shirt,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.254
so, yeah, I think these are ours.

16:44.338 --> 16:45.714
Stewie, I have a bad feeling about...

16:45.797 --> 16:47.591
Oh, God, it just ate the other bee!

16:47.674 --> 16:51.845
Okay, so a few of them
had a bad reaction to... Oh, crap.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.185
Oh, my God. Brian, run!

17:03.482 --> 17:06.193
I think, maybe giving
those bees steroids was a bad idea.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.695
- Turn on the wipers.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.123
- You're sure this is gonna work, Peter?
- Absolutely.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.167
Gronk went to the University of Arizona.

17:22.251 --> 17:24.461
And everyone who went
to the University of Arizona

17:24.545 --> 17:26.171
believes leprechauns are real.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.132
And since Cleveland already owns
a green suit and a top hat...

17:29.216 --> 17:31.343
This is my Easter clothes.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.472
Whoa! A leprechaun.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.640
Say the thing.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.851
Top of the morning
to you, Mr. Gronkowski.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.311
Have you any interest in a pot of gold?

17:41.395 --> 17:44.523
All you have to do is move to Tallahassee.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.900
Wait a minute, this is just a disguise.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.486
Son of a bitch!

17:49.570 --> 17:52.155
What's goin' on here?
Are you guys tryin' to get rid of me?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.658
- Yeah, we're tryin' to get rid of you!
- Why?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.994
'Cause you're a pain in the ass
to live next to.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.580
I mean, what the hell, Gronk,
why you gotta be like this?

17:59.663 --> 18:00.831
You're a millionaire.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.667
You've the sweetest job in the world.
You could do whatever you want.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
Why you gotta act like
such an idiot all the time?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.798
It's not a choice, Grover,
but rather, an obligation.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.135
You see, I've been groomed for this
my entire life.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.596
Scoring touchdowns, making people laugh.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.015
Punishing my body, enduring the pain.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.184
All in the name of entertainment.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.646
Don't you understand? I'm a commodity.
A product, a modern-day gladiator.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.024
You ask about the whys
and the wherefores

18:27.107 --> 18:28.442
behind the boorish facade.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.943
The answer is simple.

18:30.027 --> 18:32.905
I play the jester
because society deems it necessary.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.325
Also, I'm fuckin' insane.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.913
Eat a butt, fatty.
Gronk ain't going nowhere.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.789
- Oh, that's it!

18:44.333 --> 18:45.834
Oh, cool, we're partyin'?

18:45.918 --> 18:48.212
You guys mind if I eat while
I beat you up?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.849
What the hell are we supposed to do?
We're surrounded.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.226
Hang on, I've got this.

19:02.309 --> 19:06.271
"Meg, come outside. We have Pinkberry."

19:08.482 --> 19:11.151
Ow, ow. Stop. Stop it!

19:11.235 --> 19:12.736
All right, they're distracted. Let's go!

19:13.820 --> 19:15.656
Quick! We just have to get rid
of the queen.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.574
- She's in the hive.
- What's that gonna do?

19:17.658 --> 19:19.535
The bees instinctively stay
with the queen.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.245
So if she's gone, they'll follow her.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.121
Okay, great, but how are we gonna do it?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.883
You guys are bad fighters.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.718
That's his third sub.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.306
Oh, cool. Honey rain.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.685
Ah! Oh my God, is that a bee?
You have bees here?

19:45.269 --> 19:47.229
Uh, yeah, it's the world.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.359
Holy crap, there's a ton of them.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.153
Dad, start up the party bus. We're moving.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.947
- Bees?
- Yeah, bees.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.700
And they're showing blitz.
We gotta leave on two.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.917
You think their Wi-Fi is "Badge down"?

20:09.543 --> 20:11.044
Yeah, that's probably them.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.046
Look at that, no password.

20:17.676 --> 20:20.512
Thank goodness, we finally
have our neighborhood back.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.806
Yeah, now maybe Wilson can move back in

20:22.890 --> 20:24.892
and give me homespun wisdom
over the fence.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.685
Peter, that was <i>Home Improvement.</i>

20:27.269 --> 20:30.397
It's exhausting that you never just go
with somethin' I say.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.108
<i>Coming up, yesterday's brisket.</i>

20:34.318 --> 20:35.861
<i>But first, breaking news.</i>

20:35.944 --> 20:38.947
<i>Rob Gronkowski has been</i>
<i>suspended from the Patriots</i>

20:39.031 --> 20:42.784
<i>following a failed drug test that showed</i>
<i>evidence of steroids in his system.</i>

20:42.868 --> 20:45.078
<i>The star athlete claims he has no idea</i>

20:45.162 --> 20:47.331
<i>how the banned substance</i>
<i>got into his body.</i>

20:47.414 --> 20:49.499
- Oh, no way!
- That's terrible.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.878
<i>When pressed for further comment,</i>
<i>Mr. Gronkowski said simply,</i>

20:52.961 --> 20:54.421
<i>"Grover, go long."</i>

20:54.505 --> 20:55.547
Uh-oh.
