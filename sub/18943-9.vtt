(Susan) I can't believe
you brought these.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.800
(Kurt) Sh. OK, four packets of cigarettes,

00:08.439 --> 00:10.959
25 fags and two joints between them,

00:11.399 --> 00:15.719
three miniature brandies,
two vodkas and a Breezer, all empty,

00:15.719 --> 00:17.219
four porno mags...

00:18.440 --> 00:20.679
and some pills.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.879
- (JP) What are they?
- Haven't a clue

00:22.879 --> 00:25.000
but they don't have smiley faces.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.798
They could be for a heart condition.

00:27.799 --> 00:30.558
- Confiscated from who?
- Fuck knows.

00:30.559 --> 00:33.039
If there's a cardiac we'll hand them back.

00:33.039 --> 00:34.918
(JP) What's the book?

00:34.919 --> 00:37.440
Improve Your Powers
Of Communication.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.839
Vince Kosten was reading it in my class.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.120
Said he got it to improve his debating.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.120
- Soft twat.
- You need to improve yours?

00:45.600 --> 00:49.730
I was thinking of using it
to improve my chat-up technique.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.299
(Kurt) Good thinking.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.070
- You sure this is a good idea?
- Yes, it's a fantastic idea.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.920
- I'm celebrating.
- You have been all weekend.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.678
I know. Good, isn't it?

01:02.679 --> 01:04.919
- Who's up for slammers?
- Twist my arm.

01:04.919 --> 01:06.758
And mine!

01:06.759 --> 01:08.958
She's starting to worry me.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.280
If you'd got rid of Alec, you'd celebrate.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.000
- True.
- Should we pay for this round?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Fuck off! This is brilliant.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.280
(Kurt) I found 20p so
I've got more than when I came in.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.920
I never realised Jenny was so generous.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.040
If we keep telling her how lucky she is
to be rid of Alec,

01:28.040 --> 01:30.119
we may never have
to buy a drink again.

01:30.119 --> 01:32.600
We could afford
taxis to and from school.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.600
- I'll use Simon's bike.
- What for?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.760
- Get fitter.
- What if I want to use it?

01:38.839 --> 01:41.720
- Well, you don't.
- I was thinking about it.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.960
- Only after I said about it.
- No.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.600
- Simon said I could have it.
- No, he didn't.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.920
- Well, I'm using it tomorrow.
- I'll toss you for it.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.960
- I'm using it!
- No, you're not.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.239
- Fucking am.

- Bit of a cold.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.499
Tissues are there.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.999
The English department are going to be
pretty stretched now.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.840
A supply teacher
could've covered Simon's classes

03:22.840 --> 03:25.999
but no one's available long-term
so it's down to us.

03:25.999 --> 03:28.839
There's no way
we can cover all the classes.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.800
- That's a bit defeatist.
- I'm just being honest.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.239
Try being honest and constructive.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.359
- What about Penny?
- Penny?

03:36.360 --> 03:38.719
Can she take on more responsibility?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.918
She's... too inexperienced.

03:40.919 --> 03:42.960
She's here to gain experience.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.880
She's not ready
to take on a full schedule.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.918
She's been here long enough.

03:47.919 --> 03:50.038
- Hasn't she?
- It's just...

03:50.039 --> 03:51.879
- (Creaking)
- Just what?

03:51.880 --> 03:55.439
- She hasn't covered everything.
- What's been the problem?

03:55.439 --> 03:58.519
- (Creaking)
- No specific problems, just...

03:58.559 --> 04:00.359
Why isn't she ready?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.279
- I...
- (Creaking)

04:02.280 --> 04:05.280
- Bob?
- Penny was falling behind

04:05.360 --> 04:09.070
which is when I suggested
perhaps I ought to step in.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.280
OK!

04:15.360 --> 04:17.920
- I'll get her up to speed.
- It's a lot of work.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.517
- Good.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.438

04:27.239 --> 04:30.239
- Yes.
- Comfortable? Confident?

04:32.160 --> 04:35.160
- Yes.
- Timetable.

04:37.239 --> 04:41.119
You'll be taking over half of
Simon's lessons, starting today.

04:41.119 --> 04:44.119
Welcome to full-time teaching.

04:46.959 --> 04:51.369
Jenny will be available for any advice
or support you may need.

04:51.679 --> 04:54.359
- Great.
- Liz will ensure worksheets

04:54.360 --> 04:56.760
and syllabus information are to hand

04:56.760 --> 05:00.200
and that textbooks
are given out and accounted for.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.320
There's nothing like
a plunge into the deep end.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.320
To see whether you sink or swim.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.958
Bob?

05:19.959 --> 05:23.529
As you know, we've been left
with a staff shortage.

05:24.079 --> 05:29.360
The English department in particular will
be stretched in the lead-up to Christmas.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.200
So it's going to be a difficult few weeks.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.190
All that we ask is that people
be flexible and available.

05:36.279 --> 05:39.840
I've looked at the schedules
and there are a few sessions

05:39.840 --> 05:42.040
that you'll need to cover from...

05:42.040 --> 05:45.400
- Where are you going?
- To use the photocopier.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.920
- I haven't finished.
- Then carry on.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.799
- This doesn't concern you?
- I won't be available for cover

05:51.799 --> 05:57.259
so rather than just sit here and nod,
I'll do something more constructive, OK?

05:59.039 --> 06:02.039
OK? Right, well...

06:03.119 --> 06:04.718
Kurt?

06:04.719 --> 06:07.879
Ah, yes, you've got a nice run
of free lessons here.

06:07.879 --> 06:10.889
Let's see if we can't fill them up for you.

06:12.079 --> 06:15.859
- Why is it always me?
- You've got more free periods.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.360
- Plus you're a walkover.
- How does JP get away with it?

06:20.360 --> 06:23.880
It's all in here. He has
a clear idea of who he's talking to

06:23.880 --> 06:25.919
and what makes them tick.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.199
He sees their hidden agendas.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.350
- Doesn't he just say no?
- There's that too.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.439
You're not the only one,
I've got to sort Penny out.

06:35.439 --> 06:38.119
You have to focus
on the end-of-day drink.

06:38.119 --> 06:40.160
- I've stopped drinking.
- When?

06:40.160 --> 06:43.559
- Since about 20 minutes ago.
- You're not coming to the pub?

06:43.559 --> 06:46.799
- Better things to do.
- It's the hangover talking.

06:46.799 --> 06:50.920
(Jenny) Before Alec, what did you
think of when you thought of me?

06:50.920 --> 06:53.279
- Honestly?
- Of course.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.280
- Arse.
- And... seriously scary person.

06:57.279 --> 06:59.318
- What about you?
- Work.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.599
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

07:01.600 --> 07:05.120
I've become distracted
and now I need to get back on track.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.120
Getting back on track is overrated.

07:09.759 --> 07:14.169
(Sighs) Looks like you'll have
to get down the cashpoint, then.

07:14.679 --> 07:18.039
"Ego food's in short supply
yet in great demand.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.519
"And if you become
a supplier of that food,

07:20.519 --> 07:22.878
"you will be in great demand

07:22.879 --> 07:25.439
"and command
extra affection and attention."

07:25.439 --> 07:27.479
How does that help me?

07:27.480 --> 07:29.518
You start off by telling Bob

07:29.519 --> 07:32.839
what an inspirational teacher
he is and a handsome man.

07:32.839 --> 07:36.040
Then you say that
you can't do the extra classes.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.920
I can't tell you how much
I wish that would work...

07:38.920 --> 07:42.680
Could work with Jenny too.
Tell her nice things about herself,

07:42.680 --> 07:45.438
then she'll start buying rounds again.

07:45.439 --> 07:48.439
What nice things?

07:48.959 --> 07:53.089
(Sighs) I can't get beyond
"You've got an incredible arse".

08:02.160 --> 08:03.919
Jenny, hey!

08:03.920 --> 08:06.558
Is... that a new outfit?

08:06.559 --> 08:10.519
We saw you come in this morning
and said, "That's a new outfit."

08:10.519 --> 08:13.739
- It's not.
- It must be the way you carry it.

08:14.959 --> 08:18.200
I like the way you're wearing
your hair today too.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.490
- It's very... well cut.
- How are you feeling?

08:21.600 --> 08:25.080
Right now? Very wary.
Whatever it is, the answer's no.

I'll be all over you like a rash.

08:34.239 --> 08:38.200
Decide how long you will spend
on each section of the lesson

08:38.200 --> 08:40.438
but be flexible enough for discussion.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.520
Make an impression -
not too severe or easy-going.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.020

can tell if you fake it.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.478
Study the papers before the lesson

08:51.479 --> 08:54.840
and you won't get caught out
by surprise questions.

08:54.840 --> 08:59.959
If you are, blag it. Don't let them see you
don't know what you're talking about.

08:59.959 --> 09:05.139

13:04.919 --> 13:07.400
That supposes I'm a good teacher, yeah?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.438
Yeah.

13:09.439 --> 13:12.238
That's where your plan falls down.

13:12.239 --> 13:15.239
Right there.

13:15.479 --> 13:18.479
- Why Oscar Wilde?
- He's funny.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.720
Funny. Good.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.638
- What else?
- A big bender.

13:30.639 --> 13:33.600
- (Stifled laughter)
- Did that affect his work?

13:33.600 --> 13:35.999
You're the teacher, you tell me.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.719
(Whispering)

13:38.720 --> 13:41.870
Want to share
what's so interesting, Natasha?

13:41.879 --> 13:44.798
- No.
- Is it relevant?

13:44.799 --> 13:46.478
No. Sorry.

13:46.479 --> 13:49.600
Then maybe you'll have
the courtesy to shut up.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.600
Right. Oscar Wilde.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.400
We need to work on basic lesson
structure and presentation.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.919
Also how you deal with stress
and anxiety in a classroom.

14:02.919 --> 14:05.600
My preferred method
is detached firmness

14:05.600 --> 14:07.960
and a no-nonsense attitude
that says,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.840
"Don't even think about messing with
me." Start with your worksheets.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.999
- If I get them.
- You'll get them.

14:13.999 --> 14:17.009
- You overreacted to Natasha.
- Did I? Why?

14:17.039 --> 14:19.840
She just discovered her mum
is really her gran

14:19.840 --> 14:23.520
- and her sister is her mum.
- How was I supposed to know that?

14:23.520 --> 14:25.879
- I assumed everyone knew.
- I didn't.

14:25.879 --> 14:29.280
If you'd told me I could
have handled it differently.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.478
Think about your next lesson.

14:31.479 --> 14:35.119
There's a long way to go
but I think we can make it.

14:37.239 --> 14:40.679
- Where were those worksheets?
- Oh, something cropped up.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.519
- Clare's pencil needed resharpening?
- Sorry?

14:43.519 --> 14:45.560
Or you ran out of scrap paper?

14:45.560 --> 14:48.719
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

14:48.719 --> 14:52.519
You made sure I didn't get those papers
so my first lesson was a disaster.

14:52.519 --> 14:56.019
- I wondered who you'd lash out at first. -
What?!

14:56.720 --> 15:00.150
You can't blame yourself
for being crap, can you?

15:04.479 --> 15:07.479
You forgot this.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.679
What you're looking for
is attention-grabbing headlines

15:18.679 --> 15:20.720
and articles you'd wanna read.

15:39.679 --> 15:42.679
You're Clare. Test me.

15:42.839 --> 15:46.919
Why haven't you handed in those reports
I asked for days ago?

15:46.919 --> 15:49.919
It's all part of a long-term plan.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.510
- What plan?
- You're not seeing the big picture.

15:54.559 --> 15:57.880
- What big picture?
- Stop seeing things in black and white,

15:57.880 --> 15:59.918
life's about greys.

15:59.919 --> 16:03.639
You've not told me
why you haven't handed in the reports.

16:03.639 --> 16:06.599
I know. You deflect the question.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.479
That way you never commit yourself
to an excuse

16:09.479 --> 16:11.520
and no one can check up on it.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
- Not bad.
- Worth five quid.

16:16.359 --> 16:20.489
One drink won't dismantle
the whole rehabilitation process.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.999
- Coming for a drink?
- I told you, I'm off it.

16:27.999 --> 16:31.799
(Kurt) That was before a day
dealing with 1,000 fuckwits.

16:31.799 --> 16:34.600
She wants to stay focused
and responsible.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.120
What about your responsibility to us?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.599
(Brian) We need your focus too.

16:39.600 --> 16:44.080
This isn't because Jenny bought
four of seven rounds last night?

16:44.559 --> 16:47.849
- No!
- I can't believe you think we'd be so...

16:48.520 --> 16:50.119
mercenary.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.759
It just won't be the same without Jenny.

16:52.759 --> 16:55.960
If she's not going
I might not bother, actually.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
- (Brian) Nor me.
- OK, OK.

16:59.639 --> 17:02.639
But I'm only staying for one.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.079
I'm on a roll!
Ask me to do something for you.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.079
- Like what?
- Anything work-related.

17:14.159 --> 17:18.118
Can you download some information
about the French Revolution for me?

17:18.118 --> 17:21.118
- Sorry, not in my remit.
- Yes, it is.

17:22.279 --> 17:25.279
- Is it?
- It's IT - bang on your remit.

17:26.199 --> 17:29.139
- Fuck. When do you want them?
- Too easy!

17:30.719 --> 17:33.318
- What should I have said?
- Ask me.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.480
Can you download some info
on the French Revolution for me?

17:36.480 --> 17:39.519
Sorry, I'm having trouble
with the search engine.

17:39.519 --> 17:43.359
We have to relocate to another server
and check the whole system.

17:43.359 --> 17:46.359
Oh, fuck.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.040
She needs to get a plan
in place and stick to it.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.400
Once she feels confident
she can branch out a bit more.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.559
Is it just me or is everyone thirsty?

17:59.559 --> 18:01.959
- Fancy another?
- I don't know.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.480
- Your round.
- You know how it is at first,

18:04.480 --> 18:07.200
you feel like nobody is listening to you.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.278
- (Sighs)
- What?

18:09.279 --> 18:12.709
Correct me if I'm wrong
but isn't this shop talk?

18:13.159 --> 18:17.289
- Aren't I incredibly thirsty?
- Talk about something else.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.599
Like our top ten ways of getting a shag?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.439
- Sounds good.
- You start.

18:21.439 --> 18:23.720
I'd love to but I've got work to do.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.318
Well, give us your top five, then.

18:26.319 --> 18:29.319
- Top three?
- I'll see you tomorrow.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.000
- (Kurt) She's regressing.
- Same again?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.560
With Alec, she was too busy getting
banged to worry about anything else.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.600
- She'll get back to normal soon.
- What if this is normal?

18:40.600 --> 18:43.600
Then we'll just have to kill her.

I think it's exciting and easy to initiate.

20:51.599 --> 20:54.278
I'll let Jenny explain.

20:54.279 --> 20:56.319
It's pretty straightforward.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.680
It'll take the form
of a simple classroom chart.

20:59.919 --> 21:03.760
All we have to do is note any student
who is having problems,

21:03.760 --> 21:07.240
like illness or a family break-up,
jot it down and hand it in.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.090
This information will be distributed
amongst the staff.

21:11.199 --> 21:14.239
It's just an expansion

21:14.239 --> 21:18.239
Carol and Liz will be printing up
the charts this morning.

21:18.239 --> 21:21.239
I know it seems like a lot of extra work.

21:22.919 --> 21:26.120
(Clare) You'd be amazed
how quickly these things

21:26.120 --> 21:29.120
become just another part
of school life.

21:29.159 --> 21:32.559
Send Alec a letter saying he's forgiven
and sign it "Jenny"?

21:32.559 --> 21:35.559
I wouldn't wish that even on Alec.

21:37.159 --> 21:40.159
- Gotta go.
- Busy, busy.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.079
- When did you leave the flat?
- Six-ish.

21:44.079 --> 21:47.279
- Is there a 6am?
- The only way this will work

21:47.279 --> 21:50.880
- is if it's taken seriously.
- I am taking it seriously.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.000
Yes, but can you keep an eye
on the others so they don't mess it up?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
- Me?
- They listen to you.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.559
Only when I say something
they wanna hear.

- Fuck knows.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.760
Make sure Kurt doesn't get any.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.540
She rang me at 7:30am
to remind me about lesson plans.

22:09.639 --> 22:12.649
Don't worry,
she's got another crusade now.

22:13.319 --> 22:17.029
I've got your year 7s later,
have you got any advice?

With emotional trauma,
it's how you come to terms with it.

This process is best done on your own

23:01.719 --> 23:04.959
or in private sessions
with a trained professional.

23:04.959 --> 23:08.760
However, if you wish it to be discussed
in the staff room,

23:08.760 --> 23:11.438

23:38.840 --> 23:41.359
Until the end of term, yes.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.199
- Mum says you're not a proper teacher.
- Does she?

23:44.199 --> 23:46.239
She says you're a trainee.

23:46.240 --> 23:50.119
I'm an NQT - a newly qualified teacher,
so I'm qualified.

23:50.119 --> 23:52.839
Anyway, what does your mum
know about me?

23:52.839 --> 23:54.559
- A lot.
- Really?

23:54.560 --> 23:58.060
I'm sure we'd all like
to know what. Enlighten us.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.318
- It's not a good idea.
- Oh, come on.

24:02.319 --> 24:05.038
We're all fascinated, aren't we?

24:05.039 --> 24:08.749
- (Amused murmuring)
- Whatever it is, I can take it.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.599
OK. She thinks you're one of
the worst trainees she's ever seen

24:12.599 --> 24:14.039
and she's seen a lot.

24:14.039 --> 24:17.720
You're into astrology,
which means you're a dizzy cow.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.439
You've got a confidence problem
which makes you use people.

24:21.439 --> 24:25.279
You're two-faced with dyed hair,
capped teeth, false breasts...

24:25.279 --> 24:27.439
OK! I get the picture.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.440
And then she threw me out.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.000
(Kurt) Show me a teenager
who isn't dysfunctional.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.599
- Katherine Timberlake.
- What?

24:36.600 --> 24:40.100
You asked for a teenager
who wasn't dysfunctional.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.320
But the very fact that,
at 16, she's not dysfunctional

24:43.320 --> 24:45.479
means she's totally dysfunctional.

24:45.479 --> 24:48.000
So we should focus on the normal ones?

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
That's where your serial killers
will come from, believe me.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.558
- Think they've got matches?
- Yep.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.599
Should we say something?

24:56.600 --> 24:59.479
- Like what?
- Like, "Stop doing that."

24:59.480 --> 25:02.480
- Would they take any notice?
- No.

25:19.439 --> 25:22.439
Thanks. Thank you.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.319
Thank you. Where's yours?

25:25.320 --> 25:28.320
- I lost it.
- Lost it? How?

25:28.719 --> 25:32.079
At three I was left outside
a supermarket for four hours.

25:32.079 --> 25:34.399
Now I can't remember anything trivial.

25:34.399 --> 25:37.599
- I need it for the records.
- Why? It's bollocks.

about me to Kayla?

26:52.240 --> 26:56.079
(Barely audible) Why have you been
talking about her to Kayla?

26:56.079 --> 26:58.599
Tell her I don't have to talk to Kayla.

26:58.599 --> 27:02.079
She has two eyes, two ears
and can make up her own mind.

27:02.079 --> 27:05.079
Erm... eyes, ears and... mind.

27:05.919 --> 27:08.919
- What have I ever done to you?
- Nothing.

27:08.959 --> 27:11.000
But you've wrapped everyone else

27:11.000 --> 27:13.800
around your little finger
since you got here.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.599
- Look at Carol.
- What about Carol?

27:16.600 --> 27:19.839
The way you used her,
got her chasing after you.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.878
And you haven't?

27:21.879 --> 27:24.839
You think you can get everything,
all you want,

27:24.839 --> 27:28.899
by batting your eyelids
and looking vulnerable, don't you?

27:29.119 --> 27:32.199
You're a conniving,
manipulative little cow.

27:32.800 --> 27:36.440
And the sooner Clare sees it,
the better for all of us.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.780
Carol, I hope I never gave you
the impression I was using you.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.598
- (Mumbles)
- Thank you.

27:43.599 --> 27:46.158
You think everyone respects you.

27:46.159 --> 27:49.480
They only tolerate you cos you
hold the stationery closet keys.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.758
How sad is that?

27:51.759 --> 27:54.440
Even Carol's only here
because she has to be.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.400
Given the chance she'd run
a million miles, wouldn't you?

27:58.400 --> 28:03.160
You're a nasty, vindictive, malevolent
bitch and everyone hates you.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.200
(Gasping sobs)

28:20.119 --> 28:23.119
- (Wailing sobs)
- Shit.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.630
Shouldn't someone be
comforting her or something?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.640
- Go on, then.
- I didn't mean me.

28:34.479 --> 28:37.479
Liz? Is there anything we can...

28:41.999 --> 28:45.039
At least she's got
a healthy supply of tissues.

28:45.039 --> 28:47.439
Maybe we should leave her for a bit.

28:47.439 --> 28:50.439
- Give her time to...
- (Resumes wailing)

28:50.639 --> 28:53.639
be upset.

28:53.839 --> 28:56.839
If you need anything...

28:56.920 --> 28:59.920
- We'll be in the pub.
- (Wailing sobs)

29:39.879 --> 29:42.879
(Resumes wailing)

29:47.439 --> 29:50.439
(Sobs)

29:52.359 --> 29:55.280
If Liz can be reduced to tears,
anything can happen.

29:55.280 --> 29:59.410
- World's gone fucking mental.
- What did Penny say to her?

29:59.799 --> 30:02.399
She told her she was
a vindictive bitch

30:02.399 --> 30:05.879
and we only tolerated her
because of her position.

30:05.879 --> 30:08.879
Sounds fair enough.

30:09.199 --> 30:11.719
Erm... how is she?

30:11.720 --> 30:13.759
Erm...

30:13.760 --> 30:17.190
Not good... not coming out...
she'll have, erm...

30:18.519 --> 30:21.519
double Bacardi and Coke and, erm... nuts.

30:23.559 --> 30:26.559
(Carol) Bye.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.599
Fucking hell, that's a real skill,

30:31.599 --> 30:34.479
drinking seven Bacardis
and crying at the same time.

30:34.479 --> 30:36.520
She didn't pay for any of them.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.719
You forgot something.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.480
- I thought you'd want it.
- I'm pissed, you take it.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.120
- I can't be arsed.
- Take the fucking thing.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.320
- I'm letting you have a go.
- I don't want a go.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.440
- You do.
- Don't.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.159
- Do!
- Don't!

30:50.160 --> 30:52.240
- Leave it here, then.
- Right, I will.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.250
- Fine!
- Fine! You're so fucking childish.

30:56.119 --> 30:59.119
- You are.
- You are.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.319
(Susan) She spent the whole
evening in the pub toilet.

31:20.319 --> 31:24.119
Didn't stop her necking seven double
Bacardis and six bags of nuts.

31:24.119 --> 31:26.319
- She had to carried out.
- Shit.

31:26.319 --> 31:29.800
- Started as a fight in the office.
- A fight about what?

31:29.800 --> 31:32.239
My guess is
Penny's feeling the pressure.

31:32.239 --> 31:35.239
- Penny?
- Penny had the fight with her.

31:35.439 --> 31:38.238
- Why?
- She needed to let off steam

31:38.239 --> 31:41.080
- and Liz got in the way.
- Why didn't she do that to me?

31:41.080 --> 31:45.879
Because you're so wrapped up in
this scheme everything else fades away.

31:45.879 --> 31:49.999
- You agreed this was important.
- No, you assumed I agreed.

31:49.999 --> 31:53.279
Doesn't knowing the kids better
make us better teachers?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.440
It would put me off
teaching altogether.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.480
- You said you'd help.
- I am.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.559
People are still pissing around.

31:59.559 --> 32:02.760
- That's their prerogative.
- Can you talk to JP...

32:02.760 --> 32:05.760
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- Sure.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.840
If we can get JP,
Brian and Kurt on our side,

32:08.840 --> 32:11.840
everyone else will fall in behind.

I don't want to sound fanatical about this

32:17.080 --> 32:20.520
but if we can persuade them,
the scheme would take off

32:20.520 --> 32:22.558
and we'd see real benefits -

32:22.559 --> 32:25.039
the students would feel more secure

32:25.040 --> 32:27.880
and all the research says
a secure student

32:27.880 --> 32:30.839
is a well-behaved,
productive student.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.999
(Jenny) It just needs
enthusiasm from the staff.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.039
I've got that in spadefuls.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.999
I think Clare will see
how important this really is.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.799
Which is what I find exciting -
if we get the basics in place

32:42.799 --> 32:46.079
we can tailor the work
to students' specific needs.

I was amazed
at the information uncovered.

I did notice that some members of staff

34:05.399 --> 34:09.458
have decided to give their imaginations
a little exercise.

34:09.799 --> 34:13.319
That's why I've decided
to take it off its informal footing

34:13.319 --> 34:17.029
and place it firmly
at the centre of our working day.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.040

but also some genuine problems
which warrant attention.

40:31.039 --> 40:35.000
I think we can get through them all
in a couple of hours.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.999
You know I think
this scheme's a great idea.

40:37.999 --> 40:41.360
But it is turning out to be
a little labour-intensive.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.639
- I think it's worth it.
- I've got annual reports to do

40:44.639 --> 40:47.759
and the governors need
a detailed outline of my aims.

40:47.759 --> 40:51.329
- What are you saying?
- It may need more planning.

40:53.279 --> 40:56.760
How about we put it on
the back burner for a while? Yes?

40:56.760 --> 40:59.760
Good.

41:00.199 --> 41:03.199
I'll get back to you in the new year.

(♪ Feeder: Under The Weather)

41:08.520 --> 41:12.160
Jenny's right about
communication within the school.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.238
Will you give it a rest?

41:14.239 --> 41:17.160
"Gather all the information
you can about someone

41:17.160 --> 41:19.359
"before you enter into a dialogue."

41:19.359 --> 41:21.759
So knowing you're a dense Northern twat

41:21.759 --> 41:25.439
helps me to tell you to shut
the fuck up about that book?

41:25.439 --> 41:28.589
"Hostility is no way
to conclude an argument.

41:28.599 --> 41:30.959
"To effectively win an argument,

41:30.960 --> 41:34.460
"each person needs to feel
good about the outcome.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.090
"Compromise is not a dirty word,
it's a necessity."

41:39.879 --> 41:42.760
- That makes sense.
- (Kurt) Bollocks, it does.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.560
To win an argument
you must crush the person,

41:45.560 --> 41:48.920
- force them to agree with you.
- Anyone need a drink?

41:48.920 --> 41:50.800
- Anyone not?
- Liz is here.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.800
- Where?
- Toilets.

41:53.840 --> 41:57.559
- Thanks for the warning.
- (Brian) What about the drink?

41:57.559 --> 42:00.639
- Another time.
- You could leave the money.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.439
It's self, self, self with her.

42:03.439 --> 42:06.519
- Whose round is it?
- Funny you should ask.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.439
- I'll go halves with you.
- I'll go thirds.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.960
Does no one buy
a proper round any more?

42:11.960 --> 42:14.919
- Mine's a triple.
- What's up?

42:14.920 --> 42:18.210
You'll all be pleased
to hear you got your way.

42:18.319 --> 42:21.278
Clare's put my scheme
on the back burner.

42:21.279 --> 42:23.559
- Shit.
- Don't pretend you're upset.

42:23.559 --> 42:27.519
- I am for you, not the scheme.
- Well, it's been binned.

42:27.519 --> 42:30.519
- Why?
- The usual. Lack of foresight.

42:30.879 --> 42:32.919
I didn't take into consideration

42:32.919 --> 42:36.520
the petty nature of people
when asked to put in extra effort.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.600
That'll let you down every time.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.120
You really thought
my scheme was a rubbish idea?

42:41.120 --> 42:43.399
No, I knew it was a rubbish idea.

42:43.399 --> 42:47.389
You can know too much about
people. Especially 11 to 18s.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.920
It doesn't merit in-depth investigation.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.759
At least it didn't fall apart
due to a lack of effort by me.

42:53.759 --> 42:55.839
Maybe that's exactly why it fell apart.

42:55.839 --> 42:58.079
- What do you mean?
- You're an obsessive.

42:58.079 --> 43:00.680
- That's how you do everything.
- I don't.

43:00.680 --> 43:05.160
With your work it's all or nothing,
then it was Alec or nothing,

43:05.439 --> 43:08.199
then Alec went and now it's work again.

43:08.200 --> 43:11.359
You don't have to be
the all-conquering superwoman,

43:11.359 --> 43:14.359
you can just be normal.

43:14.559 --> 43:17.559
Do you think I'm an obsessive?

43:19.120 --> 43:23.320
Let's take a vote. Hands up
who thinks Jenny's an obsessive.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.760
I'm going to the bar.
