WEBVTT

00:19.375 --> 00:21.166
Whoo!

00:25.416 --> 00:27.916
Come over here, come on!

00:52.083 --> 00:53.166
Sky?

02:08.041 --> 02:09.458
Don't be afraid.

02:10.916 --> 02:12.291
You built this?

02:15.083 --> 02:16.750
Why aren't you playing with the others?

02:21.250 --> 02:22.500
Hm.

02:23.041 --> 02:26.083
Loneliness is often the byproduct
of a gifted mind.

02:26.708 --> 02:27.708
What is it?

02:28.500 --> 02:32.666
Hmm? Oh. This is Rio.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.375
She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.125
Here.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.583
-Go on.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.083
Hmm.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.833
-She's dying.

03:03.750 --> 03:08.916
I'm attempting to prevent that.
The mutation must survive.

03:09.625 --> 03:10.500
Can I help?

03:11.541 --> 03:13.208
You want to assist me?

03:14.833 --> 03:16.000
Very well.

03:19.666 --> 03:20.958
We can be loners together.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.541
Good to see some things haven't changed.

03:40.666 --> 03:44.666
Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon
an aspiring young scholar

03:44.750 --> 03:46.083
from the undercity here,

03:46.583 --> 03:49.916
ruminating in his steel oasis.

03:50.916 --> 03:53.083
I heard your prognosis.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.416
I'm terribly sorry, my boy.

03:57.791 --> 04:00.000
Do you contemplate death, Professor?

04:00.875 --> 04:02.583
Only that of friends.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.791
I suppose your legacy
has been well-secured.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.041
As one of Piltover's founders,

04:08.125 --> 04:10.666
what haven't you to show
for your remarkable life?

04:14.708 --> 04:18.541
You should be proud
of what you've accomplished, Viktor.

04:22.583 --> 04:23.875
Figments.

04:23.958 --> 04:28.166
My contributions will be short-lived,
even in your memory.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.375
I have seen many students.

04:32.333 --> 04:37.666
It's a sad truth that those
who shine brightest often burn fastest.

05:06.041 --> 05:09.166


05:09.250 --> 05:14.541


06:03.750 --> 06:05.333
I didn't know you were an artist.

06:08.083 --> 06:11.166
Hm. There's quite a lot about me
you don't know.

06:12.708 --> 06:15.375
Listen, I'm sorry
for disappearing last night.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.250
-Duty calls.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.125
Viktor's dying.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.791
I think it has something to do with gasses
in the fissures where he grew up.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.500
Exactly the sort of thing
we wanted to fix with Hextech.

06:44.625 --> 06:48.958
Improving lives. Solving real issues,
not just trade disputes.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.041
Viktor saved my life once.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.708
Now, he needs me
and there's nothing I can do.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.458
I hate feeling so useless.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.875
I didn't realize you were so close.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.000
He's like my brother.

07:05.666 --> 07:07.458
Why did you come to me with this?

07:07.958 --> 07:08.875
I just…

07:09.500 --> 07:12.041
Nothing feels impossible
when I'm with you.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.333
I'm an exile from my family.

07:18.416 --> 07:19.250
What?

07:19.916 --> 07:20.750
Why?

07:21.375 --> 07:23.750
I fell short of Medarda standards.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.375
I don't believe that for a second.

07:27.541 --> 07:28.500
Do you?

07:30.791 --> 07:32.750
You should be with him, Jayce.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.666
We can't change
what fate has in store for us,

07:35.750 --> 07:39.666
-but we don't have to face it alone.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.958
It's a beautiful painting.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.458
-Chuck!

08:52.583 --> 08:55.375
Thieram. Uh… My name's Thieram.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.916
Nice try, Chuck.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.083
What's all the hubbub?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.666
Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.916
Someone? Anyone?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.250
-Who are you grabbing?
-Some girls.

09:08.833 --> 09:11.083
I mean, I mean not…
I'm not grabbing girls.

09:11.166 --> 09:14.125
Oh, other than the… those ones… I guess.

09:14.208 --> 09:17.625
Focus. Who are they?
Why wasn't I invited to the party?

09:17.708 --> 09:19.375
Uh, I don't know.

09:19.458 --> 09:22.875
They… they got in a fight with Sevika.
They did a number on her.

09:22.958 --> 09:24.791
Oh really? Which number?

09:24.875 --> 09:26.666
It's like a saying…

09:27.291 --> 09:29.583
You're doing great, Chuck.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.333
Here, for your troubles.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.458
Silco's goons aren't far behind.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.125
We have to keep moving.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.291
What the hell is that?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.458
The sign.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.875
Never mind, just help me to the edge.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.958
-Can you do this in your--

10:27.625 --> 10:28.833
Shit.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.958
Come on!

10:41.583 --> 10:43.208
Come on. Let's go!

10:49.208 --> 10:50.375
We lost her.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.166
Lost who?

11:29.958 --> 11:33.208
I feel like you and I
got off on the wrong arm.

11:35.666 --> 11:37.250
Maybe we should try the other.

11:38.791 --> 11:42.541
No need. It's your sister.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.166
She's back. She's looking for you.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.625
It's not what you think.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.041
She's with some girl enforcer.
Guess she replaced you.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.666
You're lying!

11:55.750 --> 11:57.708
Why bother?

11:57.791 --> 12:01.125
Her back in town, it's only a matter
of time before you implode

12:01.208 --> 12:03.583
and Silco finally gets the message

12:03.666 --> 12:06.583
that you're about as good for our cause
as you were for your family.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.666
-Jinx.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.625
Ten outta ten, toots!

12:18.708 --> 12:22.708
I think I know
just how to deliver that message.

12:53.791 --> 12:57.416
Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

12:57.916 --> 13:01.666
You were so busy,
little Ren here saw me in.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.416
Let's talk outside.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.041
Can't you see we're playing?

13:20.875 --> 13:24.375
You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

13:24.458 --> 13:27.916
Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy
here assured me that she left with him.

13:34.375 --> 13:38.250
But it seems she never made it.
Isn't that sad?

13:38.833 --> 13:42.541
Could you imagine being separated
from your father?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.208
She's… in a safe place.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.083
She's in the Lanes.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.375
That's not possible.

13:51.458 --> 13:57.250
There's an enforcer with her. A girl.
Roughly the same age.

13:57.333 --> 14:01.833
Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them,
she does whatever she wants.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.875
I… can't control her.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.541
Then of what use are you?

14:09.875 --> 14:10.875
I'll track her down.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.208
I can fix this.

14:14.416 --> 14:15.625
Please.

14:16.791 --> 14:19.125
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

14:20.125 --> 14:23.666
What's important
is that we don't repeat them.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.500
-My people are tracking Vi and this…

14:26.583 --> 14:30.708
…Caitlyn.
They cannot be allowed to resurface.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.208
Do we understand each other?

14:34.500 --> 14:35.333
Hmm.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.333
Hmm.

14:50.500 --> 14:54.750
Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.

15:04.583 --> 15:05.583
Watch.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.166
It responds to organic matter.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.791
Incredible.

15:26.541 --> 15:29.000
This is unlike anything
we've ever seen, Jayce.

15:29.083 --> 15:33.666
It, it, it could be the key to augmenting
physiology, extending life…

15:33.750 --> 15:36.708
-Curing you.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.791
It's happened to everyone.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.625
I can't determine why.

15:46.041 --> 15:49.458
They're… rejecting the transmutation.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.750
-We'll solve this.
-There may not be time.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.833
We're in uncharted waters here and…

16:03.916 --> 16:07.541
I can feel my body… eroding.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.416
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger.
He might know something that could help.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.666
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.791
What is this place?

16:30.875 --> 16:32.291
It's where the kind of people
you topsiders

16:32.375 --> 16:36.208
-don't want to think about, wind up.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.916
It was never this big, though.

16:51.416 --> 16:52.333
There.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.083
I know you have your reservations
about me,

17:32.166 --> 17:34.666
but this only works
if we can trust each other.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.125
It doesn't work. It never has.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.125
You topsiders always find a way
to screw us.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.500
I suppose topside is to blame
for all your misfortunes.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.666
-No.

17:46.916 --> 17:48.375
Not all of them.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.541
We aren't monsters, you know.
We're people, just like you.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.166
You don't know anything about me.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.041
I shouldn't have left you.

17:58.958 --> 18:03.041
It's all right.
Despite it all, I can tell…

18:04.166 --> 18:05.500
you have a good heart.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.291
-<i>You've got a good heart.</i>

18:14.583 --> 18:15.875
What is that?

18:18.375 --> 18:20.208
I'm calling it the Hexcore.

18:21.583 --> 18:26.958
It's an adaptive rune matrix.
Hextech that evolves.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.791
It's groundbreaking.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.041
What's most exciting
is that it reacts to biological matter.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.208
There are stories of healing magic.
Our samples thus far have perished…

18:43.583 --> 18:45.041
You must destroy it.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.375
What?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.458
Please, if ever you've put faith
in my guidance, hear me now.

18:52.541 --> 18:55.958
I've seen nations destroyed
by a single seed and it looked…

18:57.125 --> 18:58.958
exactly like this.

18:59.041 --> 19:01.333
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

19:02.833 --> 19:07.583
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed. What did you do?

19:07.666 --> 19:09.625
What do you mean, Professor?

19:11.333 --> 19:15.000
It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

19:15.583 --> 19:18.000
-Wait.
-No. I won't let you.

19:18.083 --> 19:21.666
-Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.333
I will have it destroyed
one way or another.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.333
That's your opinion.
We'll see if the Council agrees.

19:39.541 --> 19:41.666
I might know someone else who could help.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.875
You do what you have to.
I need to get ready.

19:47.041 --> 19:47.916
For what?

20:00.958 --> 20:02.916
-Is she all right?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.750
Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.833
That's Vi, right?

20:09.666 --> 20:11.750
I'm a friend.

20:13.375 --> 20:17.708
Or at least I was. I mean,
I… I owed her old man my life.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.458
Probably more than that.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.125
I guess.

20:22.875 --> 20:25.583
-She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.

20:26.583 --> 20:29.041
Not so simple to come by around here.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.500
-Hey.

20:30.583 --> 20:31.958
I'm sorry.

20:32.041 --> 20:37.875
Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone else
who might be able to help.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.458
Come with me.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.333
Ailment?

20:53.416 --> 20:54.833
Uh…

20:57.250 --> 20:59.000
Uh… she's been stabbed.

21:04.291 --> 21:05.875
She makes potions.

21:05.958 --> 21:07.875
Helps people here with…

21:07.958 --> 21:10.125
…with this.

21:11.125 --> 21:14.333
Shimmer. Why would you take something
that does that to you?

21:15.916 --> 21:19.875
I just… wanted to feel what it was like…

21:19.958 --> 21:23.958
To be somebody.
To make other people afraid.

21:24.958 --> 21:26.125
-Instead of--

21:26.208 --> 21:28.500
-Trade.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.625
-Thank you, I really--

21:59.791 --> 22:03.416
Let's go. I think Vi will be happy
to see a friendly face.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.833
No, no. You go ahead.

22:06.916 --> 22:09.250
She knew me when I was still…

22:09.750 --> 22:13.458
Anyway, I don't want her
to see me like this.

22:13.958 --> 22:19.875
Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry.
About everything.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.375
Okay?

22:34.958 --> 22:37.041
I found this on one of the Firelights.

22:37.125 --> 22:40.791
It matches fragments we found
outside your lab and at the Hexgates.

22:42.666 --> 22:46.500
I… have reason to believe
they're planning more attacks.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.375
Well, how has this threat
gone unnoticed for so long?

22:49.875 --> 22:53.250
Since the Hexgates were completed,
the fissures haven't been a priority.

22:53.333 --> 22:56.791
Oh, we'll settle that later. For now,
we need to prevent any further attacks.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.375
Short of searching everyone
who crosses the bridges.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.125
I don't know how we can.

23:03.291 --> 23:04.625
Then, that's what we'll do.

23:04.708 --> 23:09.416
-Are you certain? This sort of an order--
-Do it. We have to protect the city.

23:16.166 --> 23:17.166
One other thing.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.416
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner
released on your order.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.041
Is there anything I can assist with?

23:26.041 --> 23:29.458
No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

23:30.958 --> 23:34.416
Councilors, we have lost our way.

23:35.708 --> 23:39.375
This city was founded
to be a bastion of enlightenment.

23:39.458 --> 23:43.916
In a world that cannibalized itself
over power and pride.

23:44.541 --> 23:45.916
But we've forgotten.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.125
Loosened our morals in favor
of comfort and convenience.

23:50.208 --> 23:52.541
Traded honor for prestige.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.708
We were once one tribe.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.958
Now we are Houses divided.

23:58.458 --> 24:04.958
I believe, if we set aside our greed
and arrogance, we can be one again.

24:05.541 --> 24:09.041
It will take vigilance.
We must hold each other accountable.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.666
And who holds you accountable?

24:11.333 --> 24:12.541
What?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.708
Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.

24:14.791 --> 24:17.791
Attacks at the Hexgates
and in the Academy Square.

24:17.875 --> 24:22.416
Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes.
All under your watch.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.291
Jayce, you forget yourself.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.375
I'm sorry, Professor,

24:26.458 --> 24:28.666
but healing this city
will take more than just speeches.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.375
Time and again,
you've warned us what not to do.

24:32.458 --> 24:37.041
But let me ask you this,
what's your plan to fix this?

24:37.125 --> 24:39.125
I see what this is about.

24:39.208 --> 24:42.666
Your Hextech projects need more time.
More safeguards.

24:42.750 --> 24:47.625
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.

24:48.291 --> 24:52.708
We need a leadership
focused on the future, not the past.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.041
You are the true Father of Piltover,

24:55.625 --> 24:58.000
and your years of service
can never be repaid.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.583
I believe it's time we gave
the beloved founder of our city…

25:03.333 --> 25:05.166
a well-deserved retirement.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.833
Jayce, don't do this.

25:09.166 --> 25:10.083
Hmm.

25:17.708 --> 25:20.791
It has to be unanimous.
All in favor?

25:27.666 --> 25:31.125
With my deepest respect and appreciation,
Professor.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.083
Vi.

26:16.791 --> 26:19.958
-Easy, easy, easy.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.750
We need you back on your feet.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.583
What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?

26:33.375 --> 26:36.208
Right. Jinx. How could I forget?

26:36.291 --> 26:38.291
We're going to have
to be more careful now.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.791
-Silco will be watching--

26:52.541 --> 26:53.791
You used to live here?

26:54.583 --> 26:56.375
Who's Powder?

26:58.666 --> 27:02.208
My sister. I thought she died, but, no.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.083
I have to try and find her.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.291
How do you not know
if your sister is alive or dead?

27:07.833 --> 27:11.083
It's hard to check up on people
from inside a concrete cell.

27:11.166 --> 27:12.875
What, you don't have parents?

27:13.625 --> 27:16.958
No! They were killed by enforcers.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.958
Vander's prodigy.

27:51.833 --> 27:55.458
I've regretted that we never had
the opportunity to speak.

28:01.166 --> 28:03.000
What have you done with my sister?

28:03.875 --> 28:06.458
-I've freed her.

28:06.541 --> 28:10.750
Candidly, I thought you were the prize
of your secondhand family.

28:11.291 --> 28:12.500
But Jinx…

28:16.583 --> 28:18.750
Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.

28:28.458 --> 28:33.291
I'm gonna find her and erase whatever
fucked-up delusions you put in her head.

28:33.375 --> 28:37.875
But first, I'm gonna bring
your bullshit empire down all around you.

28:40.416 --> 28:43.541
You don't know your limits, girl.
It's what got Vander killed.

28:43.625 --> 28:47.750
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.625
-Yeah, well…

28:53.250 --> 28:54.791
You talk too much.

29:33.333 --> 29:36.416
<i>Wherever you are,
light it up and I'll find you.</i>

31:44.458 --> 31:46.208
Rio will live.

31:46.875 --> 31:47.875
You did this?

31:47.958 --> 31:53.541
I thought you understood.
The mutation must survive.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.125
I understand now.

32:37.416 --> 32:40.875
How many problems can one girl cause?

33:22.541 --> 33:24.000
-Powder?

33:36.666 --> 33:38.333
-Vi?

33:38.416 --> 33:39.541
Oh, Powder!

33:50.583 --> 33:52.291
I'm so sorry, Powder. I…

33:52.375 --> 33:56.208
I tried to come back. I promise, I did.
But I… I got arrested.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.541
Marcus?

33:57.625 --> 33:59.458
I don't know. I… It doesn't matter.

33:59.541 --> 34:01.791
I just… I never thought I'd see you again.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.875
Are you real?

34:07.541 --> 34:11.833
Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.875
I'm here. I'm right here.

34:15.125 --> 34:19.583
Things changed when you left. I changed.

34:20.500 --> 34:24.916
I know, Pow-pow, I know.
You did what you had to do to survive.

34:25.416 --> 34:28.708
Me too. It's okay.

34:28.791 --> 34:31.125
What matters is we're together.

34:39.500 --> 34:40.875
Who's she?

34:40.958 --> 34:41.791
Who are you?

34:41.875 --> 34:44.291
-It's okay. She's a friend.

34:44.375 --> 34:48.125
Sevika wasn't lying?
You're with an enforcer?

34:51.125 --> 34:53.041
Your sister is Jinx?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.291
Caitlyn, just listen,
we can work this out.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.291
This is a trick! You're playing me!

34:59.375 --> 35:01.916
Shut up! I'm in no mood.

35:02.541 --> 35:03.583
We didn't say anything.

35:03.666 --> 35:04.833
I wasn't talking to you!

35:04.916 --> 35:06.500
Powder, it's okay.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.500
Stop calling me that.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.958
It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.

35:12.041 --> 35:13.125
You're not a jinx.

35:13.208 --> 35:15.708
-God, I never should have--
-Stop talking to me like I'm a child!

35:15.791 --> 35:17.458
Was that why you came?

35:17.541 --> 35:19.291
For this stupid stone?

35:19.375 --> 35:22.333
No, I don't even know what that is, I…

35:22.416 --> 35:25.083

You're a class act, Sister.

35:25.166 --> 35:29.333
Sister. Thought I missed her.
Bet you wouldn't miss her.

35:29.416 --> 35:32.666
Powder! I'm here for you. Only you.

35:32.750 --> 35:35.458
You can fire that thing if you want,
but I'm not going anywhere.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.958
I'm not going to abandon you again.

35:41.333 --> 35:44.000
-Everyone, shut up, I need to think.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.041
Do you hear that?

37:23.583 --> 37:25.833
-Powder.

37:34.041 --> 37:35.541
-Powder!

37:50.958 --> 37:53.166
-Take her.

38:14.416 --> 38:15.583
Vi?

38:17.583 --> 38:18.833
No!
