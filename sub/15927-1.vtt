01:58.797 --> 02:01.179
Motherfuckers!

02:37.669 --> 02:41.161
Alright, let go. Hey, come on.
Let's do it right here, what you got?

02:41.241 --> 02:44.497
Come on, it'll be alright. Jade's waiting.

02:44.577 --> 02:46.835
Thanks, baby.

03:10.402 --> 03:13.059
<i>How long have you been feeling like this?</i>

03:13.139 --> 03:15.228
<i>I don't know.</i>

03:15.308 --> 03:17.399
<i>Couple of days.</i>

03:17.743 --> 03:20.202
<i>I guess since the other night.</i>

03:22.816 --> 03:24.070
What happened?

03:24.150 --> 03:27.040
I don't know, I blacked out,
I can't remember.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.076
- You black out lots?
- Anha, I feel like shit, alright?

03:30.156 --> 03:33.125
- My back is killing me.
- How are your breastasis?

03:33.205 --> 03:35.648
My titties fucking hurt. You know,
and they're not even that big.

03:35.728 --> 03:38.785
- You got nice tits, Lou.
- Thanks, Sadie Lady.

03:38.865 --> 03:41.393
- What's your diet normally like?
- What do you mean?

03:41.473 --> 03:43.280
- She eats like shit.
- No, I don't.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.259
She microwaves everything.
It's beast food. It's true, Lou.

03:46.339 --> 03:49.711
When was the time of your last period?

03:49.791 --> 03:50.844
Recent enough?

03:50.924 --> 03:54.519
Do you remember the last time
you performed intercourse?

03:57.049 --> 04:01.790
- It was not much of a performance.
- Better not have been Mickey.

04:03.290 --> 04:06.079
- You drink?
- Yeah, yeah, obviously.

04:06.159 --> 04:08.481
- Everyday?
- Anha, come on, yeah.

04:08.561 --> 04:10.913
You gonna wanna see a doctor, Lou.

04:10.993 --> 04:15.622
Come on, Anha, I can't afford that, okay?
Anha, look, I don't have insurance.

04:15.702 --> 04:18.458
I was just hoping you could,
you know, really suss it out.

04:18.538 --> 04:21.293
Lou, I work for a vet.

04:21.374 --> 04:24.263
I can't prescribe anything.

04:24.343 --> 04:28.191
Look, I feel like shit, alright?
I just need something to take the edge off.

04:28.271 --> 04:30.987
You can go to the military clinic.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.158
It's free.

04:38.473 --> 04:40.437
Thank you, thanks a lot.

04:40.517 --> 04:43.633
They're prenatal vitamins.
My sister never took them.

04:43.713 --> 04:45.070
Fuck.

04:49.518 --> 04:52.978
Man, thanks for nothing, Anha. Fuck!

04:54.156 --> 04:57.013
- What do you wanna do now?
- I don't know.

04:57.093 --> 05:00.151
Let's grab some booze or snacks.

05:26.522 --> 05:28.044
- That's what he said.
- Yeah.

05:28.124 --> 05:31.216
- You didn't hear me?
- I don't know. I don't listen.

05:40.135 --> 05:42.761
I haven't been laid in months, okay?

05:43.639 --> 05:46.596
I know that I been on a bender.

05:46.676 --> 05:49.762
But I think I'd remember
if I had someone's cock in me.

05:49.842 --> 05:52.385
Maybe you should sell yourself on TV.

05:52.715 --> 05:54.904
One of those phantom pregnancies?

05:54.984 --> 05:58.241
Those girls who go through it all
and didn't even realize they were pregnant.

05:58.321 --> 06:00.677
You know,
and then it falls out all preemie

06:00.757 --> 06:03.256
and they bury it in the closet
before prom?

06:03.526 --> 06:06.482
- Fucking preemie, Sadie.
- Well, born too soon.

06:06.562 --> 06:08.577
Shit's fucked up.

06:11.766 --> 06:16.091
I don't know, fuck it, what does Anha
know anyway, right? She's a vet.

06:16.171 --> 06:17.593
A shitty vet.

06:17.673 --> 06:20.563
Well, you said it yourself, Lou,
you've been on a bender.

06:20.643 --> 06:23.066
You just need to stop partying
for a couple days.

06:23.146 --> 06:27.303
I'm not a dog, you know. She doesn't
even know anything about people.

06:27.410 --> 06:30.642
I heard a dog got addicted
to heroin because of her.

06:38.793 --> 06:40.850
I got too high. I mean...

06:40.930 --> 06:44.354
I just... I really can't be pregnant,
alright? It's not my style.

06:44.434 --> 06:46.055
You can always get rid of it.

06:46.135 --> 06:49.327
I'm not gonna pay some asshole
to scramble my guts.

06:50.372 --> 06:54.530
There's always someone who wants
a baby. Just adopt it out.

06:54.610 --> 06:57.734
You think I can find somebody to
push me down a staircase or something?

06:57.814 --> 07:01.204
But you gotta quit drinking, no smoking.

07:01.284 --> 07:04.140
Who needs that shit?
Jeeze Louise, come on, Sadie.

07:04.220 --> 07:08.511
Lou, you can handle it.
I was pretty wasted when I was pregnant.

07:08.591 --> 07:11.449
Yeah, what was that like?
All that you know...

07:12.428 --> 07:15.453
It was so long ago, I don't remember.

07:30.545 --> 07:32.570
Come here.

07:33.448 --> 07:35.038
Thank you.

07:35.418 --> 07:38.477
Why don't you go ahead
and load up the cooler, baby?

07:42.224 --> 07:43.982
Trish?

07:46.061 --> 07:49.185
Can I get you anything?

07:49.265 --> 07:51.451
No, no, thanks. I'm good.

07:51.531 --> 07:53.792
He'll take a beer.

07:55.037 --> 07:57.293
You ever think it...
it's kinda funny that...

07:57.373 --> 08:00.196
they wouldn't need the clean piss
if they weren't getting high.

08:00.276 --> 08:01.898
I'm not responsible for their habits.

08:01.978 --> 08:04.233
If somebody's gonna make
any money off it, it's gonna be me.

08:04.313 --> 08:07.038
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:07.916 --> 08:10.003
What am I gonna do,
send her back to Russia?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.075
Well, no, but, I mean you can't...

08:12.155 --> 08:16.048
you can't just have these girls
running around in the wild, you know?

08:24.599 --> 08:27.458
Get off that.
I told you that's not for you.

08:27.903 --> 08:30.226
Just go get some cereal.

08:30.306 --> 08:32.496
Makes the pee good.

08:33.674 --> 08:35.767
What is it?

08:36.711 --> 08:40.336
I don't know, but...
people are gonna fucking love it.

08:40.416 --> 08:44.273
- Alright, that good?
- Yeah. Well, I think so.

08:44.353 --> 08:47.510
Jade's gonna chop it up,
break it down, get it out there.

08:47.590 --> 08:50.428
Right, right. Say...

08:51.189 --> 08:55.551
What do you want me to do with Lou? She's
starting to get a bit paranoid, you know?

08:55.631 --> 08:58.821
She's fucked up all the time.
No one's gonna believe her.

08:58.901 --> 09:00.590
- Yeah.
- Don't worry about it.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.724
Cool, cool.

09:02.804 --> 09:04.763
So, what do you wanna do?

09:10.445 --> 09:12.871
You're gonna go on the fucking run.

09:14.382 --> 09:16.107
Alright.

10:02.530 --> 10:05.656
Took you long enough.
I didn't think you were gonna show.

10:06.201 --> 10:08.825
- Where'd you get Palace Chicken?
- I got lots.

10:08.905 --> 10:10.410
I love that shit, give me a wing, man.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.724
Fuck no. I have to go all the way
to Liberty for this shit.

10:12.805 --> 10:15.998
- Plus, I got a meeting on my PO tomorrow.
- Just give me the fucking money.

10:16.078 --> 10:18.334
You know they got a special
kind of bleach in this shit?

10:18.414 --> 10:22.872
When they pound, crush down the bird.
It gets rid of all the bones and beaks.

10:22.952 --> 10:24.774
Yeah, right, asshole.
Where'd you hear that?

10:24.854 --> 10:27.844
Plus, if you eat enough of it
at once, it'll pass any test.

10:27.924 --> 10:30.179
So, what you gonna do,
just eat yourself into a coma,

10:30.259 --> 10:32.715
hope you don't piss your pants
before you go in?

10:32.795 --> 10:35.887
- Tastes good.
- Idiot.

10:51.881 --> 10:54.303
Man, this place is a dump.

10:54.383 --> 10:56.741
I gotta clean up this shithole.

10:57.919 --> 11:00.376
It's cold in here.
You got any heat up in this bitch?

11:00.456 --> 11:03.078
What am I, a Rockefeller? Come on.

11:03.158 --> 11:07.774
Shit, man. You know,
one second it's hot, then it's cold.

11:08.464 --> 11:12.623
But I mean, the cold,
it's driving me <i>loco</i>.

11:13.201 --> 11:16.728
You know, I just wanted to come up here
and make sure everything was alright.

11:19.941 --> 11:21.966
You know?

12:02.685 --> 12:04.910
I love pissing.

12:22.003 --> 12:24.309
Hey, I'm hungry now.

12:31.013 --> 12:32.562
Sweet.

12:32.982 --> 12:35.255
Lou, your dad was smoking hot.

12:35.685 --> 12:38.976
No shit, my dad was fucking hot.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.547
You know... Sadie...

12:43.758 --> 12:46.382
sometimes being hot
just ain't enough, man.

12:46.462 --> 12:49.320
You know, after Vietnam,
he drove my mom crazy.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.207
Well, it was pretty shitty.

12:51.287 --> 12:54.740
No shit, man, no shit, Vietnam, you know.

12:54.820 --> 12:59.145
Shitty enough to get this sweet
ass pad from Uncle Sam. Right?

12:59.475 --> 13:04.402
Did you do all these?
Warren said he gave you a case last week.

13:05.113 --> 13:06.836
Oh, fuck that, man.

13:06.916 --> 13:10.356
Man, my dad fought
for the right to kill his brains.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.791
I'm just honoring his legacy.

13:28.871 --> 13:32.664
I'm just saying, if you're pregnant,
you're gonna have to slow it down.

13:33.441 --> 13:35.532
Alright, man.

13:36.832 --> 13:38.534
If I'm pregnant...

13:38.634 --> 13:41.548
like, maybe I can give this kid
some superpowers, you know?

13:42.618 --> 13:44.929
- Come on, he'll put it to good use.
- Lou.

13:45.009 --> 13:46.711
What?

13:47.757 --> 13:51.280
Let me ask you a question. Alright,
Sadie, Sadie, this is important shit.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.649
Sadie, alright.

13:53.729 --> 13:58.371
If... you can have... any superpowers...

13:58.451 --> 14:02.892
I mean, anything...
in the whole world, right?

14:02.972 --> 14:05.461
Shit, I don't know, I mean...

14:05.541 --> 14:09.334
I guess I'd wanna fly or teleport
or whatever, you know?

14:09.945 --> 14:13.659
So, I could go wherever,
whenever and get the hell out of here.

14:15.517 --> 14:17.540
Yeah, man.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.875
That'd be cool.

14:19.955 --> 14:22.180
You know what I want?

14:31.367 --> 14:32.955
Do you know what I wanna do?

14:33.035 --> 14:36.295
I wanna be like that guy who had this...

14:37.272 --> 14:41.363
He was like that fucking guy who could
turn into any animal he wanted, remember?

14:41.443 --> 14:44.069
Yeah, you had to have seen it,
it was a show.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.035
Yeah, and so...

14:46.115 --> 14:49.993
this fucking guy, he could be like
a fucking turtle or a cheetah, you know?

14:50.073 --> 14:55.077
It was a show, right? But he, you know...
just whenever you need it, man.

14:55.157 --> 14:59.699
- This was a show?
- Oh, yeah. It was badass.

14:59.829 --> 15:02.384
Well, when exactly do you need
to turn into a turtle?

15:02.464 --> 15:05.387
And what kind of trouble are you in
that you need to be a turtle?

15:05.467 --> 15:07.790
I can see you being a cheetah.

15:07.870 --> 15:10.523
Sadie, what the fuck?
What do you have against turtles, man?

15:10.603 --> 15:15.163
All kinds of fucking turtle trouble,
you put on your stealth situation...

15:17.845 --> 15:19.538
Shit.

16:58.947 --> 17:02.374
Hey! Hey, get away from my car.

17:04.752 --> 17:07.046
You passing through, lady?

17:08.156 --> 17:10.648
I said get away from my car.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.252
- You looking for work?
- No.

17:15.029 --> 17:16.821
Move!

17:17.799 --> 17:22.661
You're old, but there's a lot of guys
who are really into that shit.

17:30.311 --> 17:32.771
Get the fuck away from me.

17:34.382 --> 17:36.675
Get out of here.

17:37.118 --> 17:39.377
Get out of here.

17:40.722 --> 17:43.212
You like playing with knives?

17:47.462 --> 17:49.822
Careful out there, lady.

17:51.099 --> 17:53.559
Don't get lost, okay?

18:15.923 --> 18:21.048
<i>I tell you, friends, if you've got to train
for war, this is the place to do it.</i>

18:21.529 --> 18:24.169
Sadie, the last thing I remember...

18:25.299 --> 18:27.592
is going off with Warren.

18:28.569 --> 18:32.798
And then it's just blank.
You know, I got nothing.

18:35.110 --> 18:40.415
We were partying all day. You were
pretty lit by the time we got out there.

18:40.495 --> 18:44.175
I remember coming back here with you,
though, right? I mean...

18:44.255 --> 18:47.312
I remember coming back home.

18:47.738 --> 18:49.480
Yeah, and you passed out.

18:50.525 --> 18:53.452
Yeah, but I woke up here.

18:53.961 --> 18:56.588
Looks like you got your appetite back.

18:57.231 --> 18:59.154
Oh, yeah.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.757
You know, you go to these doctors...

19:01.837 --> 19:04.293
and they don't give a shit,
they don't care.

19:04.373 --> 19:07.396
You know, it's just in, out,
give you some pills.

19:07.476 --> 19:10.232
Shit, man, I got pills.

19:11.012 --> 19:14.733
I gotta go into work, man,
'cause I am broke.

19:16.818 --> 19:19.110
How long you been out?

19:19.488 --> 19:21.213
Well...

19:22.256 --> 19:25.918
Well... I had to go out all weekend.

19:28.129 --> 19:31.353
You know, I gotta pick up a shift
'cause after that, I got nothing.

19:31.433 --> 19:34.523
Can't you just go down to Tonya's,
work in her store?

19:34.603 --> 19:37.626
No, man, fuck that. I mean...

19:37.706 --> 19:40.763
it's basically impossible
to get in there on time, you know?

19:40.843 --> 19:43.401
I mean, I kinda need to make my own hours.

19:44.747 --> 19:47.239
It's gonna be alright, Lou.

19:52.119 --> 19:54.646
So sick of this shit, man.

19:57.226 --> 19:59.882
I live in a goddamn dump, Sadie.

19:59.962 --> 20:02.151
I mean, I can barely
even take care of myself

20:02.231 --> 20:05.490
let alone some weird
immaculate conception shit.

20:08.703 --> 20:10.726
Shit, look at that.

20:10.806 --> 20:12.728
Hey, come on, remember that place?

20:12.808 --> 20:17.335
That's the Buck Lanes.
They turned it into a fucking funzone?

20:21.350 --> 20:25.476
No, the parties are not gonna be
the same around there, man.

20:27.688 --> 20:33.841
<i>For pizza and bowling,
lots and lots of crazy fun.</i>

20:39.400 --> 20:43.063
Go, Lou. Come on!

20:50.928 --> 20:52.935
Parking lot.

21:18.272 --> 21:20.062
It's the third time
you sent her out tonight.

21:20.142 --> 21:22.368
She's popular, what can I say?

21:36.991 --> 21:39.851
Can I get one of those baggies?

21:41.162 --> 21:44.863
I'd be making a whole lot
more money if it wasn't for you.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.523
I need the stimulation.

21:47.603 --> 21:49.862
Don't give me that shit.

22:23.504 --> 22:25.364
Hello.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.340
Hey, why don't you back off, weirdo.

22:38.419 --> 22:42.114
- Weirdo.
- Yeah. You look weird.

22:47.461 --> 22:49.854
What, are you interested in cars?

22:50.498 --> 22:53.255
I'm more interested in what's inside.

22:54.837 --> 22:57.826
Well, it looks like she's almost done.

22:57.906 --> 23:01.233
But it's a little extra
if you wanna watch.

24:28.529 --> 24:30.422
Lou!

24:40.708 --> 24:42.534
Lou!

24:45.380 --> 24:47.936
- You alright?
- Hey.

24:48.016 --> 24:51.056
You know, sometimes these squatters
come around here.

24:52.119 --> 24:55.143
Thought I heard someone
banging around outside.

24:55.223 --> 24:57.462
Well, you should get that fixed.

24:57.542 --> 24:58.964
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:59.044 --> 25:02.504
It's old, but it's free.

25:03.949 --> 25:06.323
Hey, that's a nice ride, looks sweet.

25:06.403 --> 25:10.676
Yeah, it was my dad's. He drove it
out here once, he never used it again.

25:10.756 --> 25:13.412
You sure are way the fuck out here.

25:13.492 --> 25:16.518
Let's get out of here, man. Let's go.

25:18.061 --> 25:19.921
Alrighty.

25:36.782 --> 25:38.840
You got a haircut?

25:39.617 --> 25:41.907
- Don't mess my hair, man.
- I'm not messing your hair up.

25:41.987 --> 25:45.143
- I'm helping your hair.
- It took me a while to fix it.

25:45.223 --> 25:48.147
My problem was never your looks.
It was always just your attitude.

25:48.227 --> 25:50.415
What do you mean my attitude?
What's wrong with my attitude?

25:50.495 --> 25:54.252
Do I look really fucking bloated to you?
Or is that my imagination?

25:54.332 --> 25:57.522
Let me tell you what I need.
Candy... money.

25:57.602 --> 25:59.591
- And Whip-its.
- Whip-its?

25:59.671 --> 26:02.497
You put the little charger
in the cracker, go...

26:06.278 --> 26:08.866
- Got it.
- And your mind goes...

26:10.515 --> 26:13.140
I get it. I get it. I get it.

26:14.652 --> 26:17.142
Man, do my tits look bigger to you?

26:17.222 --> 26:19.799
Yeah, your tits kinda got big.
Shit, what are you doing?

26:19.879 --> 26:22.180
Listen, I know we fool around.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.850
But I'm telling you, one of these days...

26:24.930 --> 26:27.218
it's just gonna be just right...

26:27.298 --> 26:29.187
the moon's gonna be out...

26:29.267 --> 26:32.457
- the right song's gonna be playing.
- The moon's gonna come out that night.

26:32.537 --> 26:34.860
- Smoke a little weed.
- Smoke a little joint, yeah.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.396
Drink a little juice.

26:37.476 --> 26:40.868
- And see what happens.
- Just go with the flow.

26:52.756 --> 26:54.479
What are you getting?

26:54.559 --> 26:57.519
Look, I need you to go in there
and get me a pregnancy test.

26:57.599 --> 27:01.353
What? No, man, no, no, get it yourself.

27:01.433 --> 27:05.924
Man, I feel like shit. Look, if I go in there,
everyone's just gonna think I'm pregnant.

27:06.004 --> 27:09.127
If you go in there, everyone's gonna think,
you know, "look, he's getting laid.

27:09.207 --> 27:12.297
On top of that, he's being
a good dude, you know?"

27:12.377 --> 27:14.032
Man.

27:14.112 --> 27:18.103
Come on. Just do this for me, alright?

27:18.383 --> 27:22.043
Look, if you do this for me,
I'll give you a blowjob, alright?

27:22.721 --> 27:24.128
What?

27:24.208 --> 27:28.274
It'll be like I gave you a blowjob. I'm saying,
I would be willing to give a blowjob

27:28.354 --> 27:30.715
if I had to for you to just go
fucking do this for me, man.

27:30.795 --> 27:32.117
- Shit.
- Alright?

27:32.197 --> 27:36.721
- Alright, how... you got some money?
- Take this, that's like $19.

27:36.801 --> 27:41.226
And get me some of those...
gummy bears, gummy worms.

27:41.306 --> 27:43.998
Gummy bears, alright.

27:59.224 --> 28:01.282
Oh, fuck!

28:13.652 --> 28:17.011
Come on, hey, you can help me!
Let me talk to you for a second!

28:17.091 --> 28:20.444
- No, man, I don't have anything!
- You can help me out.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.304
No, man, I don't have anything, okay?

28:26.183 --> 28:28.677
What, dude? I don't have anything, okay?

28:28.757 --> 28:31.343
Just a second, come on! Fuck!

28:31.423 --> 28:33.879
Hey, open the window.

28:34.459 --> 28:36.608
- Sorry, don't have any cash.
- I can't talk to you

28:36.688 --> 28:40.118
through the fucking window.
Open the window.

28:40.198 --> 28:42.901
Buddy, buddy, buddy. Hey, hey, hey.
Move, move. Get away, get away.

28:50.908 --> 28:52.530
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:52.610 --> 28:55.004
- Here. Let's get out of here.
- Thanks.

29:02.152 --> 29:06.862
I don't know what Gabriel sells to those
freaks but it turns them pretty quick.

29:07.692 --> 29:12.083
Now, he's into some trucker speed
he got into with the marines.

29:12.163 --> 29:15.987
I'll tell you right now, okay?
It's a bunch of garbage.

29:16.067 --> 29:19.519
He got kicked out for selling,
and he runs around bragging that it was

29:19.599 --> 29:21.861
- some special ops BS, you know?
- What?

29:21.941 --> 29:25.521
He can't even get it up sometimes.
'Cause of all the tests they did on him.

29:25.601 --> 29:29.200
- That's why he's such a maniac.
- I don't mess around with that shit.

29:29.280 --> 29:33.358
You don't know what they put in that,
you know, you get nonsense.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.811
Man, I know where it goes.

29:40.023 --> 29:42.483
- Man.
- You know.

29:42.763 --> 29:44.152
Yep.

29:48.398 --> 29:52.535
- Oh, shit, hey, hey, Lou!
- Don't forget this.

29:52.615 --> 29:55.788
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Here you go, good luck.

29:56.508 --> 29:58.897
- I hope you're not pregnant.
- I hope you're not pregnant.

29:58.977 --> 30:02.170
I hope you're not pregnant... sexy.

30:02.913 --> 30:05.574
Lou, Lou, Lou.

30:08.519 --> 30:10.608
- Hey.
- Yeah.

30:10.688 --> 30:13.578
So there was a bachelor party in room 36.

30:13.658 --> 30:17.048
Whole bunch of guys and I put
some rubber sheets in there for you.

30:17.128 --> 30:20.151
Said that they had a pretty good time.

30:20.231 --> 30:24.289
And I caught my girlfriend's kid
watching me in the shower again.

30:24.369 --> 30:27.192
- Oh, yeah!
- He's a total spaz, but...

30:27.272 --> 30:29.828
this is supposed to mellow him out.

30:29.908 --> 30:32.197
Yeah, great.

30:33.534 --> 30:35.870
I feel like shit.

30:43.654 --> 30:45.910
Have you seen Warren lately?

30:45.990 --> 30:48.780
No, I think he's working
over at the funzone.

30:48.860 --> 30:52.583
Yeah, I saw him there when I went
for my nephew's birthday party.

30:52.663 --> 30:55.486
Why, what do you want
with that goon anyway?

30:57.957 --> 31:01.459
Never mind. Let's bang out these rooms.

31:01.539 --> 31:04.062
Jesus, your hair fucking gets everywhere.

31:04.142 --> 31:06.164
Did you say my fucking hair
gets everywhere?

31:06.244 --> 31:09.603
That shit gets fucking shaved raw.

31:12.049 --> 31:14.139
Do guys actually like that?

31:14.219 --> 31:16.741
I don't know what the fuck
these guys want.

31:16.821 --> 31:19.510
That's why I have one side
of my pussy really hairy,

31:19.590 --> 31:22.249
the other side shaved bare.

31:24.362 --> 31:26.699
That's disgusting.

31:26.779 --> 31:29.590
I'll fucking show you disgusting.

31:31.869 --> 31:34.659
- Give me my dollar.
- What dollar?

31:34.739 --> 31:37.284
- Fucking dollar you just pocketed.
- I don't have that dollar!

31:37.364 --> 31:39.200
Fuck!

31:40.010 --> 31:43.168
- Is that creep still in 42?
- Yeah, no one's seen him leave all week.

31:43.248 --> 31:45.457
I'm not cleaning up that shit
when he gets out of there.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.438
Who the hell knows
what he's been doing in there.

31:47.518 --> 31:52.177
- Are you still getting down with Jade?
- No, he's bad news in a bad way.

31:52.257 --> 31:55.875
- It took you a long time to figure that out.
- Yeah, he was always a terrible kisser.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.650
He used to do this really fucking
weird thing with his tongue. Hold on.

31:58.730 --> 32:02.289
Oh, yeah, what'd he do?
What, was it like this?

32:03.167 --> 32:06.180
Or sometimes he'd just jam it
in there real quick and he's like...

32:06.504 --> 32:09.527
Jesus Christ! We just partied together.

32:09.607 --> 32:13.665
I don't know, I like getting fucked up
but I don't need to make money off it.

32:13.745 --> 32:17.802
Not me, I should get a goddamn
sponsorship go corporate.

32:17.882 --> 32:21.272
He thinks we're fuck buddies or something.
I just wanna stay out of it.

32:21.352 --> 32:24.078
I don't... I don't care what he's up to.

32:24.855 --> 32:27.222
Yeah, you know where he's been crashing?

32:28.722 --> 32:30.749
No, I don't know
who he's mooching off of now.

32:30.829 --> 32:32.951
I'm gonna start in here,
you wanna work your way down?

32:33.031 --> 32:36.154
- Yeah.
- That's nast... so nasty!

32:36.234 --> 32:38.790
- You know that?
- It's fucking good pizza.

32:38.870 --> 32:42.293
Fucking bought it, left it.
Someone's gotta eat it. You wanna bite?

32:42.373 --> 32:44.662
No! Fuck. Jesus.

32:44.742 --> 32:47.899
Come on, man!
Fucking someone's gotta eat it.

32:47.979 --> 32:50.688
Fucking wasting this pizza.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.343
Pigs.

33:15.539 --> 33:17.829
Fucking shit.

33:17.909 --> 33:21.402
Throw in trash, genius.

33:21.978 --> 33:24.338
Fucking hippies.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.493
Hello?

34:19.369 --> 34:22.196
Hello, honey?

34:22.773 --> 34:24.565
Hello?

34:26.676 --> 34:30.138
I left something in the bathroom
and found you.

34:31.781 --> 34:34.041
I'm Lorna.

34:36.420 --> 34:38.710
Alright, great.

34:39.090 --> 34:41.545
Do you work here long?

34:41.626 --> 34:43.417
Yeah.

34:44.561 --> 34:46.364
Man, easy money!

34:46.444 --> 34:50.438
You must... you must see
a lot of people come and go.

34:52.370 --> 34:55.795
This town definitely
attracts some real weirdoes.

34:55.974 --> 34:57.628
Well, some are.

34:57.708 --> 35:00.534
Could be a good place to lay low but...

35:01.745 --> 35:04.038
gets sticky.

35:06.950 --> 35:08.259
Sticky?

35:10.587 --> 35:14.115
You know, people pass through
and they just never leave.

35:15.058 --> 35:17.448
So you're a local?

35:17.528 --> 35:21.452
Yeah, alright, so listen, lady, thanks a lot
for helping me out in the can over there,

35:21.532 --> 35:25.056
but, man, you know,
I'm just not feeling so hot.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.593
- Yeah, right. Of course.
- Yeah. Gotta get...

35:28.673 --> 35:31.313
- I'm sorry.
- Gotta get back to work. So...

35:31.393 --> 35:34.936
Yeah, you take care, right?
I hope you feel better.

35:42.953 --> 35:46.614
Hey, Sadie. Yeah. Hey, can you pick me up?

35:47.457 --> 35:49.781
I don't know, in 10?

35:49.861 --> 35:52.253
Hold on, let me check.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.023
No, I'm out.

35:59.103 --> 36:02.743
Yeah. Yeah, get me some donuts.

36:02.823 --> 36:04.355
Alright, cool.

36:28.665 --> 36:32.190
Donuts, donuts for Lou, donuts.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.225
Is that all you've eaten today?

36:34.305 --> 36:37.945
No, I had some pizza like,
you know, I got kinda fucked up.

36:38.025 --> 36:40.431
You're relentless, aren't you?

36:40.511 --> 36:42.333
Well... Oh, come on!

36:42.413 --> 36:46.237
I already feel terrible and miserable.
Trying to have a good time, right?

36:46.317 --> 36:47.905
You're so positive.

36:47.985 --> 36:52.090
It's almost like, it's almost
like you're glowing! Like you're...

36:52.170 --> 36:56.717
Shut up, Sadie. Just fucking cut it out,
alright, man? I'm not pregnant.

36:57.327 --> 37:00.351
You know they say your senses
get all jacked when you're pregnant?

37:00.431 --> 37:02.954
Smells, taste, hearing.

37:03.034 --> 37:06.824
You know what? Alright.
Let's just wait, okay, 'cause I'm gonna...

37:06.904 --> 37:10.731
see what these tests say.
I'm gonna pee all over them.

37:11.975 --> 37:15.002
Man, I haven't been laid in months, okay?

37:16.581 --> 37:20.806
I'm not exactly cultivating a warm welcome
nest down there, if you know what I mean.

37:21.686 --> 37:23.441
Look, it was six months ago, alright?

37:23.521 --> 37:27.078
I never told you about this 'cause
I didn't think it mattered, but...

37:27.358 --> 37:29.150
You remember that night at the auto bar?

37:30.150 --> 37:32.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

37:32.081 --> 37:36.178
I been with Mickey but I knew he
wasn't gonna do shit. That fucking prick.

37:38.703 --> 37:40.772
I just didn't wanna deal with it.

37:40.852 --> 37:43.714
I just always thought
I couldn't get pregnant.

39:05.522 --> 39:08.746
After that... I just figured
I couldn't get pregnant.

39:08.876 --> 39:11.382
You know, I thought I fucked it all up.

39:11.462 --> 39:15.289
You know... you know,
all this shit just catches up with you.

39:16.032 --> 39:19.460
- He's crazy, Lou, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

39:21.337 --> 39:23.661
Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a mom.

39:23.741 --> 39:26.364
My body literally rejected life.

39:26.444 --> 39:30.301
- This could happen to lots of ladies, Lou.
- Yeah, those ladies are fucking, Sadie.

39:30.381 --> 39:34.405
Okay, they are fucking and sucking, right?
And I haven't been laid since then.

39:34.485 --> 39:37.144
So how the hell could I be pregnant?

39:48.398 --> 39:50.688
I don't know, Lou, are you sure
you don't want some company?

39:50.768 --> 39:53.191
I don't wanna make a big deal
out of it just yet.

39:53.271 --> 39:56.060
- Are you gonna take the test?
- Well, yeah, I think so.

39:56.140 --> 39:59.180
- Call me when you find out.
- I'll call you.

39:59.260 --> 40:02.667
Yeah, I'm gonna have to drink
a bunch to make all that piss

40:02.747 --> 40:05.784
- so we'll see where the night takes me.
- The couch.

40:05.864 --> 40:08.075
Bingo!

40:08.719 --> 40:11.979
Drive safe, Sadie, it's snowing!

40:31.541 --> 40:33.334
Jade.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.973
Jade.

40:51.428 --> 40:53.654
Oh, fuck.

41:24.161 --> 41:26.417
Fuck this shit.

41:26.697 --> 41:29.654
<i>...the light of revelation.</i>

41:29.734 --> 41:35.095
<i>Embrace your future and master oblivion.</i>

41:41.845 --> 41:45.436
<i>A new world free of your body,
free of your mind,</i>

41:45.516 --> 41:48.976
<i>free of every sensational toxic desire...</i>

41:54.157 --> 41:56.417
Oh, no.

42:00.096 --> 42:04.959
<i>We dance while they eat our young.</i>

42:11.574 --> 42:14.946
<i>Do not dance.</i>

42:22.819 --> 42:27.114
<i>Let the infinity flow over you...</i>

42:27.691 --> 42:31.082
<i>in waves of blissful...</i>

42:31.162 --> 42:34.529
<i>new... freedom.</i>

43:10.700 --> 43:14.294
- She's getting comfortable.
- What do you want me to do?

43:15.339 --> 43:17.289
She's loyal.

43:17.369 --> 43:20.701
The flow's heavy and it's clean.

43:22.095 --> 43:23.150
It's gross.

43:23.230 --> 43:27.555
Yeah, maybe if you could keep straight
for a week, I could use your piss.

43:28.185 --> 43:31.976
You're still peddling pee-pee
to parolees, Gabriel. It's small time.

43:32.056 --> 43:34.278
- What's the rush?
- Yeah, I need the dough.

43:34.358 --> 43:37.048
Alright, I don't wanna lose touch again.

43:37.428 --> 43:40.855
- Still chasing that lawyer?
- He's gonna help me out.

43:42.933 --> 43:46.123
- Someone's here.
- So?

43:46.203 --> 43:49.763
So, can you get the fucking door
'cause I wanna keep working out.

44:04.921 --> 44:08.315
- What?
- Let me in, alright?

44:08.625 --> 44:10.885
I gotta talk to Gabriel.

44:15.665 --> 44:17.724
What's up?

44:20.320 --> 44:21.922
What?

44:23.506 --> 44:26.063
- Jade is dead.
- What do you mean, "Jade is dead?"

44:26.143 --> 44:29.437
He's not just dead, man,
his entire face is fucking rotted out.

44:29.517 --> 44:32.853
It's eaten off or some shit.
I don't know, it's disgusting.

44:32.983 --> 44:35.740
I saw him the other night,
he's meant to be down cutting that stuff.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.542
- What stuff?
- Stay out of this, Sadie.

44:38.622 --> 44:42.313
I was there a couple of night ago. He said
he had some ideas on how to split it up

44:42.393 --> 44:43.814
but he was having some trouble with...

44:43.894 --> 44:46.617
- What kind of trouble?
- I don't know, man.

44:46.697 --> 44:49.153
Sorry. I'm not a cook.

44:49.233 --> 44:52.823
He said he'd never seen anything
like it, man. He said it, it was strong.

44:52.903 --> 44:54.859
I told him not to fuck around with it.

44:54.939 --> 44:57.131
How are you supposed to move the shit
if you don't know how to break it up

44:57.211 --> 44:59.864
- and get it out there?
- Just shut up, Sadie.

44:59.944 --> 45:02.266
He said it was a hard crash
when he took it.

45:02.346 --> 45:05.169
Look, Gabe, this was more
than a hard crash, man.

45:05.249 --> 45:07.871
He's fucking inside out or something.

45:07.951 --> 45:10.674
Yeah, I told him I didn't know
what it was gonna do.

45:10.754 --> 45:12.877
That's your problem, Gabriel.
You don't know what you're doing.

45:12.957 --> 45:16.881
I keep a line between myself
and these fucking people. Okay?

45:16.961 --> 45:19.850
He's trying to get people high,
I'm trying to make money.

45:19.930 --> 45:24.121
- We don't know what happened to Jade.
- Wait, he's dead.

45:24.201 --> 45:27.961
Yeah, and it could've been
a fucking fire or an accident.

45:28.972 --> 45:31.172
- Is this the shit you gave to Lou?
- Yeah.

45:31.252 --> 45:34.431
- And now she's sick.
- Fuck do you care, she's always sick.

45:34.511 --> 45:36.867
If she's not hung over,
she's fucking wasted.

45:36.947 --> 45:40.237
But her fucking face caving in and falling off
might be a side effect she doesn't want.

45:40.317 --> 45:42.773
He told me we had to test it
before we could sell it.

45:42.853 --> 45:45.970
I don't use this shit and I told him
not to fuck around with it!

45:46.050 --> 45:49.236
Who told you? Isaac?

45:49.316 --> 45:51.915
Yeah, he told me what I needed to know.

45:51.995 --> 45:53.651
Hey.

45:53.731 --> 45:56.387
- What do you wanna do with it?
- With what?

45:56.467 --> 45:59.226
With the fucking body, man.

45:59.702 --> 46:03.093
He's still laying there,
the place fucking reeks.

46:03.173 --> 46:07.233
Get in your car,
go to the house, get rid of it.

46:10.380 --> 46:11.902
What's up?

46:11.982 --> 46:14.204
<i>The correct answer is...</i>

46:14.284 --> 46:17.444
<i>happy wife, happy life.</i>

48:13.569 --> 48:15.362
Fuck!

49:27.143 --> 49:30.200
<i>Everything fades away into a new reality.</i>

49:30.280 --> 49:32.069
<i>A new world.</i>

49:32.149 --> 49:34.338
<i>It is the bridge between us</i>

49:34.418 --> 49:37.307
<i>and years of physical evolution.</i>

49:37.387 --> 49:39.443
<i>Control your fear</i>

49:39.523 --> 49:43.584
<i>and embrace the possibilities
of a better living.</i>

49:44.560 --> 49:46.753
<i>Better past.</i>

49:47.530 --> 49:49.990
<i>A better future.</i>

50:07.183 --> 50:08.972
<i>Control your fear,</i>

50:09.052 --> 50:11.975
<i>embrace the possibilities
of a better living.</i>

50:12.055 --> 50:15.749
<i>Better past. A better future.</i>

51:23.792 --> 51:25.686
Fuck!

52:02.165 --> 52:06.423
<i>Hey, Lou, wanted to see how you're doing.
Gimme a call. Love you.</i>

52:06.903 --> 52:11.264
<i>Hey, Lou, you coming out tonight?
Need a ride? Call me.</i>

52:12.141 --> 52:15.900
<i>Hey, Lou, I haven't heard back from you.
Just wanted to make sure you were okay.</i>

52:16.580 --> 52:19.203
<i>Lou, this is Dave from United Collections.</i>

52:19.283 --> 52:22.005
<i>You're kinda past due
and the grace period is past.</i>

52:22.085 --> 52:24.477
<i>Please call us back at...</i>

52:55.067 --> 52:56.403
Fuck!

53:40.096 --> 53:41.921
Okay.

54:20.370 --> 54:22.028
Fuck.

54:25.908 --> 54:27.701
Fuck!

54:41.223 --> 54:44.617
- Can I help you?
- You don't remember me, do you?

54:44.960 --> 54:47.818
My name's Lorna, we met at the motel.

54:47.898 --> 54:50.123
What are you doing here?

54:51.150 --> 54:52.569
Can I... can I come in?

54:52.649 --> 54:55.062
Yeah, I'm sorry, man,
this just isn't a really good time.

54:55.142 --> 54:59.249
- My place is a mess.
- Well, it's cold out there, okay?

55:03.879 --> 55:06.339
You been off your feet long?

55:08.851 --> 55:11.608
Yeah, about a week.

55:11.688 --> 55:14.211
What are you... are you a doctor?

55:14.291 --> 55:17.431
No, no, I'm not a doctor.

55:18.928 --> 55:21.433
- A cop?
- No, no. No.

55:21.513 --> 55:24.190
No, I'm not... I'm not a cop.

55:25.234 --> 55:26.931
I'm... I'm Lorna.

55:27.736 --> 55:30.397
- What are you doing here?
- I...

55:31.473 --> 55:33.800
I wanna help.

55:34.398 --> 55:35.465
To help?

55:35.545 --> 55:40.039
Are you having difficulty
remembering things? Missing time?

55:40.449 --> 55:43.776
I... well, yeah.

55:44.086 --> 55:46.476
All the time I'm missing.

55:46.556 --> 55:50.149
Are you getting headaches?
You experiencing fatigue?

55:52.094 --> 55:55.852
Look, lady, what's all the questions, man?

55:55.932 --> 56:01.958
You feel like... like somebody switched
the channel and it's like static, right?

56:02.038 --> 56:06.396
But the volume's cranked up high.
It's like, it feels like that, right? Right?

56:06.476 --> 56:10.867
And every once in a while you'll get
a flash a fragment of an image or...

56:10.947 --> 56:13.070
a word will squeeze past the barrier

56:13.150 --> 56:15.705
but it's lightning fast
and then it's gone.

56:15.785 --> 56:20.409
It's nothing you can sink your teeth into.
It's kinda like that, do you feel like that?

56:20.789 --> 56:22.615
Yeah?

56:25.327 --> 56:27.153
Maybe.

56:27.596 --> 56:30.086
When I try to remember...

56:30.643 --> 56:35.725
Fuck. I get pummeled with these
crippling headaches and...

56:35.905 --> 56:37.894
Yeah, they won't help me.

56:37.974 --> 56:40.200
They wouldn't.

56:40.543 --> 56:44.404
- They wouldn't tell me squat.
- It stinks.

56:48.450 --> 56:50.677
Don't smell that.

56:52.855 --> 56:55.211
You okay?

56:56.089 --> 56:58.318
Fuck, man.

57:00.062 --> 57:04.390
I just overslept a bit, so...

57:05.200 --> 57:08.158
and I'm not feeling so hot,
as you can see.

57:08.238 --> 57:10.282
When'd you go to sleep?

57:10.362 --> 57:12.629
- What day is it?
- It's Thursday.

57:12.709 --> 57:14.468
Right.

57:16.312 --> 57:20.006
Yeah, so it's like... three days.

57:23.852 --> 57:26.408
You wanna get something to eat, hon?

57:27.613 --> 57:28.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

57:28.920 --> 57:30.713
Yeah.

57:30.793 --> 57:32.649
You okay?

57:32.729 --> 57:34.954
Oh, yeah.

57:42.938 --> 57:45.228
Lived out there long?

57:45.728 --> 57:49.299
Well, it's my dad's place.
He lived there for a bit, then...

57:49.379 --> 57:52.538
then he went off the deep end
and now he's dead.

57:55.684 --> 57:57.710
Sorry to hear that.

57:58.454 --> 58:00.877
It's not such a big deal,
I barely knew the guy.

58:00.957 --> 58:04.516
He wasn't really cut out
to be a dad, or a soldier.

58:06.662 --> 58:08.885
He was military?

58:09.265 --> 58:11.123
Army.

58:11.333 --> 58:13.359
I was enlisted.

58:13.819 --> 58:15.579
Yeah?

58:17.339 --> 58:19.599
You ever do any training?

58:21.844 --> 58:23.634
Me?

58:24.414 --> 58:26.169
Training?

58:26.249 --> 58:29.275
- What, in the army?
- I did.

58:31.587 --> 58:34.147
I don't think I'm cut out for that shit.

58:34.723 --> 58:36.546
None, you didn't do any?

58:36.626 --> 58:40.467
What about you, you see any...
action, any life-changing shit?

58:40.547 --> 58:42.884
Yeah, I worked in radar.

58:42.966 --> 58:46.990
They stick us in a truck most of the time,
out in some remote location.

58:47.070 --> 58:50.396
We code and ran radio waves
for military aircraft.

58:51.006 --> 58:53.840
- That sounds boring.
- Yeah, well...

58:53.920 --> 58:56.369
they were happy to see me go.

58:56.979 --> 58:59.472
Why, what'd you do?

59:01.316 --> 59:03.439
What did I do?

59:04.132 --> 59:06.412
That's a good question.

59:09.157 --> 59:10.981
Okay.

59:11.061 --> 59:13.249
Okay, there were four of us.

59:13.329 --> 59:16.286
And we were stationed
in this utility vehicle.

59:16.366 --> 59:18.988
We were running maneuvers and then...

59:19.068 --> 59:21.217
our signal...

59:22.118 --> 59:25.164
jammed. We were blinded by this...

59:25.244 --> 59:27.997
this blue light, it was really bright.

59:28.077 --> 59:31.234
It kind of like, it vibrated,

59:31.314 --> 59:33.737
you know, with this, like...

59:33.817 --> 59:36.840
like this low hum?

59:37.220 --> 59:40.877
So we're all freaking out, start running

59:40.957 --> 59:44.347
and then... just bam...

59:44.427 --> 59:47.086
I'm like face down in the dirt.

59:47.563 --> 59:51.667
And, yeah, you know,
that's the last thing I remember.

59:51.747 --> 59:53.919
What happened?

59:54.002 --> 59:55.892
Well, they wouldn't say.

59:55.972 --> 59:58.628
Once I started asking asking questions.

59:58.708 --> 01:00:01.030
Once I started, you know,

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:05.435
seeing things that I didn't...
I didn't know like, even fucking existed.

01:00:05.515 --> 01:00:09.542
Yeah, well, that was the end
of my military career.

01:00:10.385 --> 01:00:12.442
How'd you find me?

01:00:12.522 --> 01:00:15.412
What is this,
you followed me from the motel?

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:19.252
No, you know, when someone
has a trauma, their...

01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:23.486
their mind and their body, it leaves a...

01:00:23.566 --> 01:00:27.490
It's like an imprint or a, like a scar

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.663
in the psychic atmosphere.

01:00:30.772 --> 01:00:35.101
That's how I found you.
It was waving like a flag.

01:00:36.878 --> 01:00:39.002
Well, I definitely been seeing some shit.

01:00:39.082 --> 01:00:42.909
I don't know if I believe in telepathy or
whatever weird tarot cards you're dealing in.

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:50.713
But... whenever I try to think of that night
I just hit this block, you know?

01:00:50.793 --> 01:00:53.386
- Yeah.
- Like...

01:01:03.103 --> 01:01:05.598
Do you like the food here?

01:01:06.341 --> 01:01:10.766
- Warren works here.
- Yeah. Can you trust him?

01:01:10.846 --> 01:01:14.270
I don't know. Can I trust you, Lorna?

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:18.074
No. If I'm right,
these people are dangerous.

01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:20.510
This has my lab written all over it.

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:23.613
This is the funzone, alright?
It's not a spaceship.

01:01:23.693 --> 01:01:27.744
Just try to be cool, keep a low profile,
you know? It's a family establishment.

01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:29.705
Okay.

01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:39.843
<i>Your bastard science</i>

01:01:39.923 --> 01:01:43.333
<i>works to sever the bridge
in between the body and mind.</i>

01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:46.236
<i>That way they can do terrible things to us</i>

01:01:46.316 --> 01:01:49.157
<i>without anyone ever knowing.</i>

01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:07.927
<i>This world is full of wisdom.</i>

01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:11.297
<i>Nobody ever questions it.</i>

01:02:12.607 --> 01:02:15.165
<i>Worse, we're killed...</i>

01:02:15.245 --> 01:02:18.321
<i>by our own species corruption.</i>

01:02:19.748 --> 01:02:24.741
I was abducted...
by a secret US contingent...

01:02:24.821 --> 01:02:27.844
because I had been exposed to something?

01:02:27.924 --> 01:02:30.580
Something they were struggling
to understand

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:35.287
and they responded with violence and fear.

01:02:35.597 --> 01:02:39.256
And I am not the only one.

01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:42.425
When someone has an encounter...

01:02:42.905 --> 01:02:44.804
certain...

01:02:44.884 --> 01:02:48.014
psychic muscles are strengthened.

01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:52.602
And you can see things other people can't.

01:02:52.682 --> 01:02:54.974
So, you're a psychic.

01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:57.942
No.

01:02:59.022 --> 01:03:03.113
I'm just saying you become
more sensitive is all?

01:03:04.063 --> 01:03:08.101
You think of it as having
interdimensional street smarts.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.724
And right now...

01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:14.560
I'm getting a bad feeling from this place.

01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:27.006
There he is.

01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:34.414
Let's get this cocksucker.

01:03:36.258 --> 01:03:38.081
Lou, what are you doing here?

01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:40.352
Hey, buddy.

01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:44.487
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt your party.

01:03:44.567 --> 01:03:46.282
Who's that?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.493
This is Lorna. Watch out, you know.

01:03:50.573 --> 01:03:53.729
The third eye will see
right through you, bozo.

01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:57.666
I'm gonna take a break, alright?
We can hang out a minute.

01:03:57.746 --> 01:03:59.939
Wanna get high?

01:04:00.649 --> 01:04:02.438
No.

01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:04.811
Look at me, Warren, okay?

01:04:05.354 --> 01:04:07.907
I'm already pretty fucked up, right?

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:11.050
Okay. Come on.

01:04:13.295 --> 01:04:18.287
Well, I guess... congratulations? I mean,
I didn't even know you were with someone.

01:04:18.367 --> 01:04:20.726
Well, I'm not, asshole.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:24.497
Well, I don't know what you want
from me. I'm not the father.

01:04:24.577 --> 01:04:27.530
Look, I just need to know
what I'm dealing with, man.

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:30.500
What you're dealing with?
I mean, you're pregnant.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.615
I mean, you can just get it
taken care of or whatever.

01:04:32.695 --> 01:04:35.312
I know what a fucking abortion is, alright?
I'm not fucking pregnant.

01:04:35.392 --> 01:04:37.745
I'm some kind of goddamn
freak show, you know?

01:04:37.825 --> 01:04:40.994
Come on, I know you were there that night.
Just tell me what happened.

01:04:44.206 --> 01:04:45.662
He told me to take you to them.

01:04:45.742 --> 01:04:48.297
- Who?
- Gabriel.

01:04:48.377 --> 01:04:50.900
Alright, so what, man?
So, you're still doing runs for him?

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.570
Well, yeah, you know,
he's got these photos of me.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:58.093
Alright, alright, alright.
What kind of photos?

01:04:58.496 --> 01:05:02.615
- Just these photos of some girl...
- What's this have to do with Lou?

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:07.584
- Look, he's in tune with this guy.
- What guy?

01:05:07.864 --> 01:05:09.500
What does this have to do with me?

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.623
Some guy came to town and he found Gabriel
and he's trading him girls for drugs.

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:19.195
- What's his name, this fucking pervert?
- Man, let me ask you a question, alright?

01:05:19.275 --> 01:05:23.936
Like... like what the fuck did you think
Gabriel's gonna do with me?

01:05:24.847 --> 01:05:27.770
Look, Lou, I'm sorry.
I didn't know what they were up to.

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.906
I just... I just thought
we were making some money.

01:05:29.986 --> 01:05:34.310
You wanna make money off of this?
Come on. What am I supposed to do?

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.749
We need a name, yeah.

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:39.142
We need a name!

01:05:39.222 --> 01:05:41.551
I only heard Gabriel call him Isaac.

01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:45.443
- Isaac. Alright, that's better.
- But, Lou...

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:49.592
you gotta try and lay low 'cause Gabriel's
got people in tune for all kinds of shit.

01:05:49.672 --> 01:05:53.652
- You know, they're peeping everywhere.
- It's kinda hard to lay low right now.

01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:56.502
'Cause I'm walking around
with a fucking growth, you know?

01:05:56.582 --> 01:05:58.801
Like, nobody fucked me, you know?

01:05:58.881 --> 01:06:01.237
Okay, I get it, I get it. Just...

01:06:01.317 --> 01:06:04.461
- Jade's dead.
- How did Jade die?

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:07.176
I don't know. But he's dead
and Gabriel doesn't care.

01:06:07.256 --> 01:06:11.147
He doesn't care about you, he doesn't care
about Sadie, he doesn't care about anybody.

01:06:11.227 --> 01:06:13.549
Fucking squirmy, fucking wormy, right?

01:06:13.629 --> 01:06:17.230
- Hey, I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, yeah? Fuck you, man.

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:20.256
Hey, Lou. I'm sorry, Lou.

01:06:20.336 --> 01:06:23.196
Fuck, shit, fuck, fuck.

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:29.031
- I haven't seen her in a couple days.
- I need you to check on her.

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.367
It's kind of a drag
to drive up there at night.

01:06:31.447 --> 01:06:35.871
- Yeah, but Isaac is worried.
- I'm not interested in anyone, Gabriel, okay?

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.411
Just need you to make money.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:42.744
You don't even know this guy.
Just shows up and wants girls.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:45.298
- Doesn't even fuck 'em.
- Seems like an easy turnaround.

01:06:45.428 --> 01:06:47.987
And what does he want them for?

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.220
I don't care what he
wants them for, Sadie.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.089
- They're fucking runaways.
- Now, what?

01:06:53.169 --> 01:06:55.358
Says he's almost done,
getting really close.

01:06:55.438 --> 01:06:56.659
Close to what?

01:06:56.739 --> 01:07:00.062
This guy's using you just like the marines
did. You're just too thick to see it.

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:04.403
- You think I'm thick?
- No, I don't.

01:07:05.614 --> 01:07:08.938
You really think this lawyer
is gonna help you find your kid?

01:07:09.218 --> 01:07:12.308
- I can pay him.
- And then what?

01:07:12.388 --> 01:07:15.481
What makes you think
he's even gonna wanna see you?

01:07:15.924 --> 01:07:19.682
Is he even gonna remember you?
I mean, how long has it been?

01:07:19.762 --> 01:07:24.420
What have you been saying lately?
You're 35... 37.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.892
Shut up, Gabriel.

01:07:27.636 --> 01:07:30.126
If you wanna see him...

01:07:30.206 --> 01:07:33.398
finish this, go check on Lou.

01:07:52.093 --> 01:07:55.651
Yeah, do you remember...
what they looked like?

01:07:55.731 --> 01:08:00.222
We know, we know there's more than one
because Warren said "them," right?

01:08:00.302 --> 01:08:04.026
Look, I don't know, okay? I don't know,
I don't know who the fuck Isaac is, alright?

01:08:04.106 --> 01:08:08.765
- I'm sick of trying to fucking remember.
- Yeah, I know what you're feeling, Lou.

01:08:08.845 --> 01:08:11.300
You know, I know... I know...

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.603
- I know what abuse is?
- I'm a mess.

01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:16.372
I know what it looks like.

01:08:16.452 --> 01:08:20.676
And... and I know you wanna...
you wanna leave.

01:08:20.756 --> 01:08:25.184
You know? I know you want to
avoid these realities. But, Lou...

01:08:25.264 --> 01:08:27.850
you need to take control
of your experience, you know?

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.519
You really can't hand it over to them.

01:08:30.599 --> 01:08:34.223
Just do me a favor, would ya?
Just don't talk to me about vibes, okay?

01:08:34.303 --> 01:08:38.261
I'm having a hard enough time just managing
my fucking experiences, right here.

01:08:38.341 --> 01:08:41.964
This dimension or whatever the fuck,
fucking hippie shit.

01:08:42.044 --> 01:08:43.868
Alright.

01:08:45.245 --> 01:08:47.068
What's happening?

01:08:47.148 --> 01:08:51.176
You aren't pregnant, Lou. See?

01:08:52.487 --> 01:08:57.059
- What is that?
- There was a a small foreign object.

01:08:57.459 --> 01:09:02.001
I could see it. It was... it was,
like slightly raised beneath my skin.

01:09:02.081 --> 01:09:07.223
It was, like, an oval bean
but it was stretched slightly.

01:09:07.303 --> 01:09:11.930
And it... it had magnetic properties.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.296
I don't know how it got there.

01:09:14.376 --> 01:09:19.602
You know, there was no scar,
just this lump under my skin.

01:09:21.564 --> 01:09:24.343
And it was... it was mine.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.712
But they... they strapped me down.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:33.118
They cut me open and they stole it.

01:09:33.728 --> 01:09:36.719
When they removed this implant from me

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:40.526
it had started fusing to my nerves.

01:09:40.935 --> 01:09:43.095
I don't know.

01:09:49.145 --> 01:09:51.600
It sounds like a nightmare, dude.

01:09:51.781 --> 01:09:53.577
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:56.639
- It's fucking messed up. I gotta piss.
- I'm just saying.

01:09:56.719 --> 01:10:02.511
They thought I had been exposed
to other technologies...

01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:04.647
languages, even.

01:10:04.727 --> 01:10:07.049
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, like outer space?

01:10:07.129 --> 01:10:10.095
- Yeah, an alien race.
- Listen, alright, listen,

01:10:10.175 --> 01:10:13.255
I don't talk about aliens
when I'm getting high, alright, man?

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:16.158
I have a strict policy, alright?
Just don't do it.

01:10:16.238 --> 01:10:21.267
Yeah, well, you know, you can forget this
bullshit of outer space because these men,

01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:25.562
they're willing to kidnap and cut open
their own people searching for secrets,

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:28.938
so even if you don't believe they do
and they won't stop, Lou.

01:10:29.018 --> 01:10:33.636
- I mean, they're never gonna stop.
- Alright. Well.

01:10:36.959 --> 01:10:41.484
You know what, I'd be happy to let them
cut this shit out of me right now.

01:10:41.564 --> 01:10:43.319
Right?

01:10:43.399 --> 01:10:44.820
I don't care what they use it for.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.780
I don't know who these men are, but...

01:10:48.079 --> 01:10:52.128
you know, they wanna control us because...

01:10:52.708 --> 01:10:56.401
because... you know, they're scared.

01:10:56.911 --> 01:10:59.235
What? They're scared?

01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:03.627
Yeah, they can't accept something
they don't understand.

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:11.484
Whatever this is...

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.851
it feels very real, you know?

01:11:15.231 --> 01:11:17.850
Very inside the dimensions...

01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:21.641
- of this body.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:27.897
Man.

01:11:28.677 --> 01:11:31.300
I could really go for an out
of body experience right now.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.436
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:33.516 --> 01:11:37.306
Well, why don't I clean up
your foot for you?

01:11:37.386 --> 01:11:39.645
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:11:40.688 --> 01:11:43.112
That duct tape's gonna be a bitch.

01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:45.417
It's okay.

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:50.047
- Okay, you try to rest, honey.
- Yeah.

01:11:50.127 --> 01:11:51.654
You try to rest.

01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:55.591
Sorry.

01:11:55.671 --> 01:11:59.098
There you go, there you go, there you go.

01:12:06.347 --> 01:12:08.607
Sorry, sorry.

01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:47.146
Honey.

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:44.532
Lou!

01:13:44.612 --> 01:13:46.472
Hello?

01:13:50.485 --> 01:13:52.957
I didn't realize you had company.

01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:54.343
Neither did I.

01:13:54.423 --> 01:13:59.548
Sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep
last night. I hope that's okay.

01:13:59.628 --> 01:14:01.550
I brought you some donuts.

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.354
And there's coffee with that
whipped cream crap that you like.

01:14:05.634 --> 01:14:07.556
Hi, I'm Lorna.

01:14:07.836 --> 01:14:12.331
- How do you know Lou?
- We met at the motel.

01:14:13.508 --> 01:14:15.978
When's the last time you saw Warren?

01:14:17.879 --> 01:14:21.837
I don't know, at the party, why? Look, Lou,
I haven't heard from you in a few days.

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:25.076
I thought you might like,
just a little pick-me-up, you know?

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.680
I don't know, man.

01:14:30.058 --> 01:14:32.150
Look at me.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:37.953
Maybe Gabriel knows a guy, someone
who's seen something like this before.

01:14:38.033 --> 01:14:41.924
Yeah, I don't think anyone's
seen something like this before.

01:14:42.004 --> 01:14:45.361
I'll tell you right now.
I don't want anything to do with Gabriel.

01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:47.696
You know, what. I told you
not to get involved with him.

01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:51.100
Do you want me to bring you to the hospital?
Maybe you should see, like, a real doctor.

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:54.139
Don't go, they'll lock you up.

01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:59.141
- I'm going back there.
- Where?

01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:02.077
Back there, whatever happened to me
happened to me that night at the party

01:15:02.157 --> 01:15:04.179
and nobody's telling me the fucking truth.

01:15:04.259 --> 01:15:06.551
I'll drive.

01:15:07.662 --> 01:15:10.655
- That's a good idea.
- I'm coming.

01:15:33.688 --> 01:15:36.245
Yeah, you guys party here a lot?

01:15:36.325 --> 01:15:39.181
Yeah. No one bothers you out here.

01:15:39.261 --> 01:15:42.754
Alright, I remember coming here
with you, Sadie.

01:15:43.298 --> 01:15:45.557
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:49.494
You were pretty messed up
by the time we got here, Lou.

01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:53.896
- Where did Warren take me?
- Try to remember, Lou.

01:15:53.976 --> 01:15:56.632
You need to look past
those screened memories.

01:15:56.712 --> 01:15:59.204
What the hell's she talking about?

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:02.538
You need to regress back to that night.

01:16:02.618 --> 01:16:05.240
You know, what state were you in.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.497
She was wasted, Lorna.
That's the state that she was in.

01:16:08.757 --> 01:16:11.880
Lou, you're pregnant. I don't know
what you think you're gonna find here.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.983
Man, come on. I'm not pregnant,
Sadie. I'm infected.

01:16:15.063 --> 01:16:17.590
Lou, it's fucking cold,
can we just go, please?

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:20.155
You need to accept this.
Every pregnancy's different.

01:16:20.235 --> 01:16:22.491
No. I can't accept this shit, you know?

01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:26.665
Man, whatever is inside of me
is infecting my brain, my body.

01:16:27.074 --> 01:16:29.968
Okay, it's not just in my crotch.

01:16:41.489 --> 01:16:44.613
So, Warren said Jade had some killer shit.

01:16:44.693 --> 01:16:47.816
Right? And now, he's dead.

01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:50.836
- Wait, Jade's dead?
- Come on.

01:16:50.916 --> 01:16:52.739
I saw Warren, Sadie.

01:16:53.469 --> 01:16:57.225
Yeah, Warren's a pervert. He sleeps
with teenage girls, you can't trust him.

01:16:57.305 --> 01:17:02.857
Right, right, right. And Gabriel
just makes money off of them so...

01:17:02.937 --> 01:17:06.902
- what does that make him?
- He's not doing that anymore.

01:17:06.982 --> 01:17:10.739
He's been only handling
special clients for a minute.

01:17:10.819 --> 01:17:14.777
High end people. Richer people
who can pay for specifics.

01:17:14.857 --> 01:17:18.300
Yeah? Like Isaac?

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:20.285
Who?

01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:37.975
Look, I don't know, Lou. You know?

01:17:38.365 --> 01:17:40.939
I stay out of his business.

01:17:41.749 --> 01:17:45.009
Look, I don't want anything
to do with this shit.

01:17:45.353 --> 01:17:50.145
Warren told me, Sadie. He told me
Gabriel's working on something big.

01:17:50.325 --> 01:17:52.314
You're telling me you don't know
anything about it?

01:17:52.394 --> 01:17:54.485
About what?

01:17:59.033 --> 01:18:02.727
- I didn't have sex with anyone, Sadie.
- This is crazy, Lou.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:04.927
Lou.

01:18:06.107 --> 01:18:08.234
Lou! Lou!

01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:18.407
Keep the fucking plastic closed.

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:20.770
Undo her fucking pants.

01:18:22.223 --> 01:18:24.316
What's the matter?

01:18:36.204 --> 01:18:38.597
Yeah, she's ready.

01:19:07.168 --> 01:19:09.328
What did you see?

01:19:11.439 --> 01:19:13.531
It was Gabriel.

01:19:14.276 --> 01:19:18.737
- Gabriel wasn't here that night.
- You're lying, Sadie. Let her speak.

01:19:19.513 --> 01:19:21.840
Just cut the shit, Sadie.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:27.011
Look, I thought he was
just doing it for the money.

01:19:27.488 --> 01:19:30.078
I don't wanna know where he gets
his shit, I don't wanna know.

01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:33.015
What, what, what shit?

01:19:33.795 --> 01:19:35.751
Don't be dumb.

01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:40.322
Whatever the cheapest high is, you know,
whatever fucks him up the fastest.

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:43.666
He wanted to get fucked up, but they
run out of money so Gabriel has to...

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:45.827
he has to find something cheaper.

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:48.697
And so what, Sadie? He just has
no idea where it comes from?

01:19:48.777 --> 01:19:50.799
Yeah, he's a killer.

01:19:50.879 --> 01:19:55.195
No, Gabriel wouldn't touch the stuff.
He needed a guinea pig and...

01:19:55.475 --> 01:19:58.974
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Okay, so a guinea pig for what?

01:20:00.654 --> 01:20:02.411
Man...

01:20:02.741 --> 01:20:04.996
you knew, Sadie.

01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:09.084
- Yeah, I figured you wouldn't even notice.
- Well, I noticed, man.

01:20:09.164 --> 01:20:13.322
You know, I really definitely, like,
big time fucking noticed, Sadie.

01:20:13.402 --> 01:20:17.462
- I didn't know, Lou.
- Yeah. Yeah, well...

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:21.166
You knew.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:24.069
You just didn't care, right?

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.092
That's it.

01:20:33.487 --> 01:20:35.313
Okay.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.062
Lou?

01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:58.433
Lou?

01:20:58.713 --> 01:21:00.969
Lou! Lou!

01:21:01.049 --> 01:21:02.774
Lou!

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.038
Oh, fuck!

01:21:18.065 --> 01:21:20.333
- It's time. Okay.
- What, what is...

01:21:20.413 --> 01:21:24.459
I'm gonna get this thing out of you. Listen!
Listen! We're gonna get this out of you.

01:21:24.539 --> 01:21:26.566
- But we need to work together.
- Yeah.

01:21:26.646 --> 01:21:29.448
Look at me, focus, okay? Rip it!

01:21:29.528 --> 01:21:32.067
- Rip it!
- Okay!

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:39.110
Good girl, good girl.

01:21:42.857 --> 01:21:46.181
- Well, who is this lady?
- I don't know, some spaced-out mama.

01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:49.201
- She's filled Lou's head with nonsense.
- Where were they going?

01:21:49.431 --> 01:21:52.781
I don't know, they fucking left me there,
Gabriel. This has gone too far.

01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:56.391
This has gone too far? What are you
gonna do, you still want that money?

01:21:56.471 --> 01:21:59.227
Don't act like you're doing this for me.

01:21:59.307 --> 01:22:01.730
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:04.666
I know you get off on this shit,
messing with these girls.

01:22:04.746 --> 01:22:07.569
There are always people
getting dirty, Sadie.

01:22:07.649 --> 01:22:10.472
People getting used up,
people getting eaten up,

01:22:10.552 --> 01:22:14.042
and I am just trying to stay on top.

01:22:14.122 --> 01:22:17.749
On top of what? You don't know this guy,
you don't know what he's up to

01:22:17.829 --> 01:22:19.848
and you can't sell to people
if they're dead.

01:22:19.928 --> 01:22:22.818
We're gonna let this freak burn me?

01:22:22.898 --> 01:22:27.455
If Lou's still alive, then she can
handle the effects and I can sell it.

01:22:27.535 --> 01:22:29.591
I don't see that.

01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:32.464
She's not just big, she's fucked up, okay?

01:22:34.175 --> 01:22:38.100
It's an experimental
hormone supplement for women.

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.802
It's discontinued
from some lab he worked in.

01:22:40.882 --> 01:22:44.706
You have the right amount,
you get a good high, a quick euphoria.

01:22:44.786 --> 01:22:48.009
You've gotta do something.
I don't know this lady Lorna.

01:22:48.089 --> 01:22:50.970
What if she grabs Lou and takes her
out of town? Then what?

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:53.882
- What happens to Lou?
- Well, no one's getting out of here.

01:22:53.962 --> 01:22:56.454
He wants us to take her in.

01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:12.855
It's time, it's time, Lou.
We're gonna put you in bed.

01:23:12.935 --> 01:23:15.173
We're gonna get this out of you.

01:23:17.085 --> 01:23:20.676
- Okay, okay, Lou, you need to push.
- It's pulling me apart.

01:23:21.056 --> 01:23:25.149
Go, go, go, go, go!
Good, good, take another breath.

01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:38.560
Push! Come on, push, good girl!

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.028
Lou, I can see something!

01:23:41.572 --> 01:23:43.868
Oh, fuck!

01:23:52.153 --> 01:23:54.266
Oh, God!

01:24:10.638 --> 01:24:13.562
Oh, look, Lou. Look what you did.

01:24:13.642 --> 01:24:16.631
Hello. Hi.

01:24:16.911 --> 01:24:20.405
Whatever you are. Hi, Lou.

01:24:20.485 --> 01:24:22.103
Hi.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:24.042
Oh, my goodness.

01:24:38.932 --> 01:24:42.591
- No! No!
- No! Lorna!

01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:45.763
Lou! No!

01:24:54.635 --> 01:24:56.424
- No!
- Up!

01:25:00.889 --> 01:25:03.214
You can breathe now.

01:25:12.334 --> 01:25:15.891
Is that... is that what you came for?

01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:18.563
What the fuck is that thing, man?

01:25:19.606 --> 01:25:21.866
It's the beginning.

01:25:26.948 --> 01:25:29.207
Go to sleep.

01:25:30.184 --> 01:25:33.041
I don't wanna breathe that shit in, man.

01:25:33.121 --> 01:25:35.380
Rest, little baby.

01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:37.412
That's right.

01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:40.352
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be rude...

01:25:41.495 --> 01:25:43.755
Did you want one?

01:25:48.636 --> 01:25:51.729
What kind of life do you wanna
continue living, Lou?

01:25:53.039 --> 01:25:54.728
I don't know.

01:25:54.808 --> 01:25:57.999
Maybe one without you
nagging me all the time.

01:25:58.079 --> 01:26:01.870
Would you just keep getting stoned
and watching TV until it's all a blur?

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:04.339
I sure as fuck
didn't sign up for this shit.

01:26:04.419 --> 01:26:06.808
What the fuck have you
ever signed up for, Lou?

01:26:06.888 --> 01:26:10.302
Who the fuck are you? Fucking prick.

01:26:14.561 --> 01:26:16.590
You motherfuckers.

01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.320
- Stay down!
- You fucking idiots!

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.957
You're too stupid to know
what you've done.

01:26:22.037 --> 01:26:27.896
You push, you harass, you terrorize,
you cut us open like fucking lab rats.

01:26:27.976 --> 01:26:29.767
You're fucking crazy!

01:26:38.051 --> 01:26:40.375
You don't need her anymore, Isaac.

01:26:40.455 --> 01:26:43.648
She's a fucking mess,
let's just get rid of her.

01:26:44.791 --> 01:26:46.348
It's just a head.

01:26:46.428 --> 01:26:50.318
But it's the most significant form
of tissue we've been able to generate.

01:26:50.398 --> 01:26:52.604
Well, man, I don't know
what to tell you, you know?

01:26:52.684 --> 01:26:54.856
I guess I've just always been
a real overachiever.

01:26:54.936 --> 01:26:57.192
You're a wonderful candidate
for their terrain.

01:26:57.272 --> 01:26:59.794
How the fuck is she wonderful?

01:26:59.874 --> 01:27:03.631
- I've been there, Lou.
- So, you've been to space a bunch?

01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:08.636
It's a terrible place. Their atmosphere
is too toxic for a human to survive.

01:27:08.716 --> 01:27:11.466
But years of abuse have provided your womb

01:27:11.546 --> 01:27:15.343
with the perfect level of toxins
necessary for this conception.

01:27:15.423 --> 01:27:17.512
Thank you.

01:27:17.592 --> 01:27:20.118
You should be proud, Lou.

01:27:21.161 --> 01:27:23.984
I am fucking proud, you know?

01:27:24.064 --> 01:27:26.351
Gotta get it while you can.

01:27:26.901 --> 01:27:28.979
Come on, Lou.

01:27:33.006 --> 01:27:35.280
There's so much more we could do.

01:27:36.243 --> 01:27:38.834
Alright, just stop.

01:27:39.114 --> 01:27:42.078
- Come on, Lou.
- What? What?

01:27:42.158 --> 01:27:45.203
Yeah? Will you fucking stop?

01:27:45.283 --> 01:27:48.510
- Slow the fuck down, alright?
- Don't be fucking stupid, Lou.

01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:51.680
It's my life, it's my terms.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.277
- Give me the knife.
- With your body,

01:27:54.357 --> 01:27:58.440
we can create a new race that will
allow us to supply an everlasting demand

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.123
- for submission.
- Do this again and again, man?

01:28:01.603 --> 01:28:04.142
- You're insane.
- Gimme the knife.

01:28:05.388 --> 01:28:08.095
Fuck! God!
