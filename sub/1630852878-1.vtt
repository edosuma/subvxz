00:32.240 --> 00:34.659
<i>Just when you think it's all over,</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:38.204
<i>something unspeakable</i>
<i>comes after you and your family,</i>

00:38.288 --> 00:41.124
<i>murders your sister Jenny in cold blood,</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.501
<i>and disappears into thin air.</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:47.881
<i>But a clue left behind leads us here,</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:50.675
<i>to this club in Bangkok.</i>

00:53.803 --> 00:56.431
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>we still need the Wu Assassin.</i>

00:57.265 --> 00:58.516
<i> What's a Wu Assassin?</i>

00:59.517 --> 01:01.352
<i>All right. So about a year ago,</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:04.397
my friends and I
were living it up in San Francisco.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.858
Uh, my sister, Jenny, and I,
we ran this restaurant,

01:06.941 --> 01:09.861
and, um, my boy Lu Xin, he ran cars,

01:11.029 --> 01:12.530
until she showed up.

01:12.614 --> 01:16.826
A 10,000-year-old warrior spirit
brought back to Earth.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.954
And then she gave her powers to Kai,
my best friend.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.582
And then he became
the last Wu Assassin. Whatever.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.250
What, like The Avengers?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.752
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.670
-But Asian.
-Hmm.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.006
Actually, no. More like
that show from the '70s.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.092
Kai and Lu Xin are the Angels.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.968
I'm like Charlie.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.752
So what kind of mission?

02:08.670 --> 02:11.381
Um, it's a supernatural one.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.007
Sounds dangerous.

02:13.591 --> 02:14.801
It's what we do.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.825
-You seeing this?
-You know why we're here.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.954
So your friend Kai…

02:43.037 --> 02:44.747
-What about him?
-This Wu Assassin.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.542
He's got to have
some kind of powers, right?

02:47.625 --> 02:50.044
<i>He's empowered</i>
<i>by this thing called the Dao.</i>

02:50.128 --> 02:54.424
<i>He's faster and stronger than any man.</i>
<i>He calls himself Death's Instrument.</i>

02:54.507 --> 02:55.800
And your other friend?

02:55.884 --> 02:58.344
Oh no, he's just
really good at kicking ass.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.433
So why aren't you with them?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.686
This seems more dangerous.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.778
Do you want to continue your story
somewhere else?

03:15.862 --> 03:16.988
Hell, yeah.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.157
What about your friends?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.200
They'll be fine.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.285
I think.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.206
Ah!

03:29.125 --> 03:30.335
-Ah!

03:36.507 --> 03:38.843
I fucking love Thailand.

03:48.853 --> 03:52.482
Why Bangkok? I mean, what's here?

03:52.982 --> 03:54.067
Answers.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.652
I, uh,

03:55.735 --> 03:59.030
traced this material back to Thailand.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.866
It's from an ancient, old piece of stone.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.790
Kai! Up there! He's turning them.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.552
Jiangshi.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.054
Chi vampire.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.394
-What's so special about this?

04:30.311 --> 04:32.522
<i> I found it in my dead sister's hand.</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:37.652
<i>Kai, Lu Xin, and I</i>
<i>came back to my family restaurant,</i>

04:37.735 --> 04:41.489
and she was just there,
dead on the ground.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.659
Well, here's to your sister.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.956
You want to know a secret?

04:50.039 --> 04:51.207
Sure.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.752
Come here.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.089
I don't drink anymore.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.050
This will turn you into
a Jiangshi,won't it?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.057
I just want to talk.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.311
Your powers don't work on me.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.784
Who killed Jenny?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.079
Who killed my sister?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.842
-Kai!

05:44.260 --> 05:46.387
-He's not talking!
-Ah!

05:55.104 --> 05:57.523
-Ah!

06:12.830 --> 06:13.664
Assassin's strike.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.760
That's not what I was thinking at all.

06:30.264 --> 06:34.519
Yo. Hey, hey! What is this?
Yo! Press the start button, man.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.895
This isn't me.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.107
It's me. I need your help.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.983
You? Who are you?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.319
No,
I'm speaking through them.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.864
I can't hold it for long.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.534
It's not safe
to put myself out here like this.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.202
What do you want?

06:51.953 --> 06:52.912
Not here.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.791
8:00 a.m.
Silom Temple archaeological dig site.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.168
We have much to discuss, Wu Assassin.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.173
I am never coming
to a club with you ever again.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.008
-Who was that?
-We should call Tommy.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.472
Stop the van!

07:20.815 --> 07:22.066
Yeah.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.526
She didn't know anything.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.695
What about your Jiangshi?

07:27.488 --> 07:28.906
I guess we finally have a lead.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.086
The archaeological site
is owned by this biotech billionaire.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.089
Not much else on him,
but he owns that building.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.720
So, uh, we're just
going to roll onto his turf?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.389
If it gets us closer to Jenny's killer,
that's all that matters.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.766
Looks shady as fuck.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.985
It should be up on the right.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.956
Guessing he's not the valet.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.483
<i> Since founding his firm</i>
<i>in 1999,</i>

08:45.566 --> 08:48.236
<i>William Pan has formed</i>
<i>collaboration agreements</i>

08:48.319 --> 08:50.404
<i>with the world's largest companies.</i>

08:51.948 --> 08:55.201
<i>Providing scientists</i>
<i>the opportunity and resources</i>

08:55.284 --> 08:58.412
<i>to tackle humankind's</i>
<i>most perplexing problems.</i>

08:59.872 --> 09:02.542
<i>All in service of William's unique vision.</i>

09:03.543 --> 09:04.710
<i>One people,</i>

09:05.878 --> 09:07.088
<i>one world,</i>

09:08.047 --> 09:09.423
<i>one planet.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:14.136
<i>We're not just looking to the future…</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:18.015
<i>we're looking to shape it.</i>

09:20.476 --> 09:21.727
Thank you for coming.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.565
I know my message was unorthodox.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.986
I apologize for not meeting you in person.
Communicating like that was difficult.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.407
Dr. William Pan.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.706
Do you know the story of Pan Gu?

09:42.206 --> 09:43.749
Yeah, we do.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.961
The first man to shape the universe
from the great nothingness

09:47.044 --> 09:48.879
and made the heavens,
the Earth, and the seas.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.756
We all went to Chinese school.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.925
Chinese school didn't teach you
what happened to Pan Gu

09:53.009 --> 09:54.927
after he became a god.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.597
<i>He went mad with power.</i>

09:57.680 --> 10:00.057
Threatened to remake the world
in his own image.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.601
But the Dao,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.645
in its infinite celestial wisdom,

10:04.729 --> 10:09.191
called upon the first Wu Assassin
to strike down that first man.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.445
<i>Yin and yang. Chaos and order.</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:14.697
<i>These spirits have clashed for millennia.</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:16.949
I'm not the first vessel.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.368
But thanks to you,

10:19.869 --> 10:21.120
I am the last.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.248
And with the world left unbalanced,

10:24.332 --> 10:27.293
chaos and I can finally complete
our unending war.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.295
I was attacked.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.130
Barely made it out alive.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.466
And that's why
I've retreated here for safety,

10:33.549 --> 10:35.926
while my twin continues to spread chaos.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.303
Who is he?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.346
She.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.722
Yin and yang.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.643
<i>You might have heard of her. Ku An Qi.</i>

10:44.143 --> 10:45.728
Queen of the Bangkok underworld.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.690
She's going global.
Taking out any threats to her.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.068
Consuming Chi to build her power.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.404
The Shaolin in China.
The Druids in Ireland.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.742
And last month, she went to San Francisco.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.495
Ku An Qi was looking for you,

11:03.496 --> 11:04.789
but your friend intervened.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.256
Jenny.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.846
She fought valiantly.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.185
But Ku cannot be stopped.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.146
She will continue her rampage
if left unchecked.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.107
How do you know all this?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.442
<i> Because Ku and I are connected.</i>

11:34.151 --> 11:36.028
That is why I must be careful.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.198
If I open myself up to her,

11:40.282 --> 11:41.283
she will come.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.494
Follow me.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.678
This whole thing could be bullshit.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.641
In the fight,
your sister took something of Ku's,

12:05.725 --> 12:06.892
a talisman.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.769
I have the other half.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.647
I assume you have hers.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.898
What's it matter to you?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.567
It's a piece of our Essence.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.902
-She'll try to get it back.
-Good. Send her my way.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.113
In two days' time, my worse half

12:19.196 --> 12:21.699
is meeting the heads of the Five Triads
at the Vie Hotel,

12:21.782 --> 12:23.701
solidifying her power base.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.496
Cameras everywhere, no weapons allowed.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.583
-There's no honor in guns.
-And won't she know what you're up to?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.960
I'm doing my best
to shield my thoughts from her.

12:33.043 --> 12:36.172
My powers extend to the mind,

12:36.255 --> 12:38.799
while hers are focused on the body.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.553
Ah…

12:42.636 --> 12:45.389
A kidnapping mission in broad daylight.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.808
Hotel security,

12:47.892 --> 12:51.395
the five bosses of the Triads,
their whole crews.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.354
You know what?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
I got a better idea.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.109
Why don't you do the mind control thing
and send an army after them?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.819
I can't control an army.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.656
I can reach out, communicate,
hold a thought for a minute.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.075
-But that is the extent of my powers now.

13:05.159 --> 13:09.455
Well, it seems like you got
all the answers, but the answers.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.211
We're in.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.133
When you subdue Ku,
you bring her to me with the talisman,

13:21.217 --> 13:22.760
and I'll take care of the rest.

13:22.843 --> 13:23.677
No.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.471
You said the Dao is broken.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.764
Yes.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.559
But you and I together,
maybe we can restore it.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.520
Or we let it be broken.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.814
And I kill her.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.161
The hotel, it's a death trap.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.123
Yeah, but it's the person, demigod,
whatever, who murdered Jenny.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.335
Yes, I understand that,
which is why we need to be smart about it.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.629
-Look at the pieces in front of us.
-This isn't a game.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.966
Actually, it is a game.
Everything is a game, Tommy.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.427
We have the perfect opportunity right now.
We should take advantage of it.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.972
If you have a death wish
because of your sister, don't drag me--

14:08.055 --> 14:10.057
You act like
you don't care about Jenny at all!

14:10.140 --> 14:13.143
-That's the game. No one's safe.
-Ah, fuck you, man.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.021
-Yeah, fuck you too.
-Guys! Calm down.

14:16.897 --> 14:17.731
I'm calm!

14:18.315 --> 14:22.444
Ku An Qi wants the Wu Assassin.
I'll give her the Wu Assassin. Myself.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.238
We're going together.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.032
-No.
-It might not be the smartest choice,

14:27.116 --> 14:29.243
but, look,
this is the only opportunity we have.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.371
Fuck that. No way. I'll do this one alone.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.043
You know what your problem is, Kai?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.880
You think because you have powers,
you're better than us.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.215
Like we're just
some kind of fucking burden.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.357
Lu Xin is calling his contact.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.027
Can he get a rocket launcher
to take Ku down?

15:46.028 --> 15:48.405
You never know, with magic.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.702
But I guess this worked.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.581
Let me show you something.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.045
Keep this finger loose.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.339
It'll make it easier.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.552
Try that.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.727
I'm coming. I don't care what you say.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.272
I have to go. Okay?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.401
Look, Tommy.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.571
You go angry, you get yourself killed.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.741
That's… that's not how you fight.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.830
You got to understand, though, man.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.624
It's the only thing I have.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.502
Anger.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.634
Sorry to break up
the tanning session, boys.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.928
Bad news.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.472
The dude who outfitted us
for the Jiangshi mission blocked me.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.182
Too much heat at the club.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.727
Anyone else?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.521
I mean, as soon as they hear
we're going after Ku An Qi,

17:02.604 --> 17:03.939
they lose my number fast.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.109
I might know someone crazy enough to help.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.112
What? Since when
did you get a Bangkok hookup?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.071
I said "might."

17:11.989 --> 17:12.906
I'll hit her up.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.245
Something just
doesn't feel right about this.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
Something smells good.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.735
-Whoa,.
-Thank you so much.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.452
What's Preeya look like anyway?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.623
Like that.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.216
Hey! How are you?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.718
-Hey!
-It's been a long time. What's happen--

19:02.516 --> 19:04.143
Now we've got that over with.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.936
What's up, Thomas?

19:06.019 --> 19:08.188
-Thomas.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.025
Uh, first, why are we meeting here?

19:12.109 --> 19:14.611
Oh, you know, support the local economy.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.114
Plus, it's out in the open. Can't be

19:18.282 --> 19:20.450
too careful these days.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.119
You, I know.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.829
Them…

19:25.581 --> 19:27.207
-…don't know.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.003
Wow.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.923
Oh shit.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.091
Where are we going?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.760
Ah, too many questions.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.398
<i> You know who I work for?</i>

19:51.481 --> 19:54.401
Interpol, police of the world.

19:54.484 --> 19:58.238
<i>We know your Triad is meeting</i>
<i>with Ku An Qi, a known terrorist.</i>

19:59.406 --> 20:00.240
<i>When?</i>

20:01.116 --> 20:01.950
<i>And where?</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:14.713
Good luck.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.218
Agent Zulu, <i>bonjour</i>.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.430
That means, fuck off.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.974
Both of you.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.152
You wanna have fun?

20:43.992 --> 20:45.869
The Vie Hotel, tomorrow.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.414
You might wanna call in the cleaners.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.792
I thought he gave you the information.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.669
The actual cleaners.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.754
He soiled himself.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.596
Uh, Preeya, meet the boys.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.266
Boys, this is, uh, Preeya.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.309
'Sup. Lu Xin.

21:09.393 --> 21:13.355
-Lu, is that a "Sin" or a "Xin"?
-Is that supposed to be a funny joke?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.274
-What's his problem?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.234
Uh, this is my man, Kai.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.528
-Hello.
-Hello.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.947
See? Someone's got manners.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.366
-Where's your sister?
-Oh, she's not here.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.994
That's too bad. I love Jen.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.915
Anywho.
Hear you boys are on a suicide mission.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.834
What the fuck, Thomas. You told her?

21:33.917 --> 21:36.670
It's the only way she'd help.
I have to tell her everything.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.588
Yeah, I like to know
what I'm getting into.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.257
Due diligence.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.718
If you know, then why are you helping?

21:42.801 --> 21:45.637
I don't mind a little action.
It's part of the territory.

21:46.596 --> 21:51.435
This woman you're dealing with,
serious shit. Lots of people dying.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.644
She needs to be stopped.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.521
Can you get this?

22:01.111 --> 22:02.529
Let me make some calls.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.741
Enjoy your shopping, boys.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.202
Keep your mouth shut.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.080
Shopping?

22:17.544 --> 22:18.545
Mmm.

22:21.631 --> 22:22.549
The fuck?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.220
-Thank you.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.432
-Tommy?
-Yeah.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.600
How do you know her again?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.518
Oh, um…

22:33.602 --> 22:37.689
So I was actually here five years ago,
and someone stole my Louis V backpack.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.275
They took my wallet,
passport, phone, everything.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.737
So I went to the cops to report it,
and, uh, the cops didn't do anything.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.823
-So, someone told me to go talk to--
-Uh.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.368
I'm just gonna make
this story short and sweet,

22:49.451 --> 22:51.161
in case we ever have
to hear it again, okay?

22:51.745 --> 22:54.331
He got his shit jacked,
and he doesn't know anything about her.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.333
Okay, guys. Look, she's our only hookup.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.920
-We need this.
-And beggars can't be choosers.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.839
-Did you get it?
-Yes, every goddamn thing.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.257
-See?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.302
Thank you!

23:07.386 --> 23:11.223
Listen. I know it's none of my business.

23:11.306 --> 23:15.102
But, you know, I'm fond of this one.
So I got to tell you guys that your plan--

23:15.185 --> 23:17.229
Is none of your business.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.980
Relax, big guy.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.858
-We're on the same team.

23:21.942 --> 23:26.071
There is no way you're getting
that hardware into the Vie Hotel.

23:26.154 --> 23:30.534
It's locked down tight,
and the only way in is through the front.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.994
I don't like this. We need to rethink it.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.372
All right. I'll take care of it.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.333
No. Tomorrow, we're all going.
We're gonna get Jenny's killer together.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.751
Hey! Yo!

23:40.877 --> 23:42.212
Jen's dead?

23:42.295 --> 23:44.756
Uh, yeah. Our target took her out.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.174
Now it's our turn.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.509
Shit.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.429
I'm so sorry.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.645
I can help you get in.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.896
It's dangerous.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.189
I know.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.860
Security there is tight.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.404
We can use that to our advantage.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.199
We?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.921
Morning, boys.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.465
Hey. Thanks.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.385
Is this your idea of a joke?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.053
Trust me.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.473
This is 007 shit.

24:35.849 --> 24:36.850
We're good.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.271
Okay. Be careful with these.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.607
Wow.
What's so special about them?

24:44.107 --> 24:47.319
-Magic.
-Come on. Let's go.

25:36.952 --> 25:37.827
Hey.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.956
We're gonna get justice for her.

25:48.463 --> 25:49.923
What do you think?

25:51.466 --> 25:52.968
You don't want to know, Lu.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.970
Then we're thinking the same thing.

25:55.053 --> 25:55.887
Come on.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.525
Hey!

26:09.734 --> 26:13.113
Okay. Whoa, whoa! What did we do?
We didn't do anything!

26:13.196 --> 26:14.030
Goddamn!

26:14.114 --> 26:15.574
A bit much, isn't it?

26:16.199 --> 26:17.617
Are you guys seeing this?

26:17.701 --> 26:20.078
Looks like a dipshit nobody.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.205
Ah.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.874
Get up.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.169
-All right. Easy. Easy.
-Can I talk to your manager?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.963
Hey, we're just on holiday.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.549
-We're valued customers.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.844
<i>One-star Yelp review on the way!</i>

26:36.928 --> 26:38.013
Agent Zulu.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.307
Let the hotel security handle that.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.725
You just focus on…

27:07.500 --> 27:09.169
Why are you here?

27:26.436 --> 27:27.604
You're wasting your time.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.231
It's for Songkran,
the Thai water festival.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.567
That's not until April.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.028
Yeah. Well, we like to be prepared.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.698
Now you're gonna
have to reorganize her bag.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.908
You for real?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.159
Yes, I'm for real.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.204
-Bullshit!
-Look at all this mess.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.083
Stay here.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.835
What's going on?

27:50.919 --> 27:52.545
Where is our fucking visual?

27:52.629 --> 27:54.839
-I'm working on it.
-Our gear is still working.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.217
Whatever is happening
is only affecting the hotel.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.428
Something is going down.

28:05.934 --> 28:06.893
This is not good.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.105
-Zulu! Zulu!

28:21.574 --> 28:23.410
Your card. ID card.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.638
You are my men now.

28:48.643 --> 28:49.894
Come on. Fix it.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.648
-Close your eyes.
-What?

28:53.732 --> 28:54.983
Just close your eyes.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.401
-Trust me.
-Come on!

28:58.361 --> 28:59.738
Hey!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.037
Come on. Let's get out of here.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.915
-See you in a second.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.399
Stop!

29:40.779 --> 29:41.738
Hyah!

29:43.656 --> 29:45.784
-Good timing.
-Yeah. Of course it is.

29:56.544 --> 29:59.839
Ah, fuck. Who the fuck did this?

30:00.507 --> 30:02.675
-Hands where I can see 'em.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.512
Zama?

30:07.722 --> 30:08.556
Lu.

30:09.557 --> 30:10.809
What are you doing here?

30:11.392 --> 30:13.311
-You know her?
-Yeah, we met in London.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.023
I was pushing some Aston Martins,

30:17.106 --> 30:19.692
and my broker turned out
to be Interpol's finest.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.196
-Look, hey, these bodies--
-Get down on your knees!

30:23.279 --> 30:24.113
This wasn't us.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.949
So you just tripped
and fell into a massacre?

30:26.032 --> 30:29.035
Zama, you know me.
You think I would do this?

30:29.118 --> 30:30.870
There's a lot I don't know about you, Lu.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.790
This is bigger and more complicated
than you can imagine.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.791
Try me.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.125
The fate of the world.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.170
-I didn't come to fuck around.
-Don't!

30:39.254 --> 30:42.173
Agent Boucher.
I have two suspects. I need backup.

30:42.924 --> 30:43.800
Boucher?

30:43.883 --> 30:46.803
Whoever got them probably got your team.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.890
Interlace your fingers behind your head,

30:50.974 --> 30:52.892
-and get down on the floor.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.395
-I don't want to hurt you.
-Kai. Don't.

30:55.979 --> 30:59.691
Listen to your friend.
He seems to be the reasonable one.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.777
First time I've heard that.
Lower your gun.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.074
-What the fuck happened here?
-We're working on it.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.578
Let her go. She's not the threat. Please.

31:11.661 --> 31:15.456
Look, it's clear that none of us
are the bad guys.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.333
But they are coming.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.793
Who's coming?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.169
The entire hotel.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.374
On your six!

33:22.917 --> 33:24.544
-I got it.
-I'm just looking out for you.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.963
-Because that's always been your MO.
-Here we go again.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.297
You could just say sorry.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.383
-What?
-Sorry works just fine.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.635
Did you guys,
like, used to date or--

33:32.719 --> 33:33.761
-No!
-No!

33:54.615 --> 33:55.658
Zan.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.035
Assassin.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.328
Why are you here?

34:00.204 --> 34:01.456
They offered me a deal.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.208
The Wu Assassin in exchange for power.

34:16.095 --> 34:17.263
Where we going?

34:21.601 --> 34:22.977
-Fuck. Come with me
-Go!

34:39.786 --> 34:40.620
Hyah!

34:50.713 --> 34:51.589
Shit!

34:55.802 --> 34:57.470
Fuck! Get in the car!

35:25.289 --> 35:26.999
Looks like you're not
the only special one.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.321
Look out!

36:53.461 --> 36:56.214
Hey. Hey, hey, take it easy.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.021
Fuck.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.536
It's locked!

37:32.500 --> 37:33.417
Go!

37:45.596 --> 37:46.973
Door says push, not pull.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.392
What?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.694
Hold up. Where's Kai?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.445
Don't worry about Kai, all right?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.284
Oh shit. You okay?

38:06.367 --> 38:07.368
Yo, you good?

38:10.329 --> 38:11.414
Zan?

38:14.583 --> 38:17.545
-Yo, we gotta go. Come on.
-My van's still here. Come on!

38:31.350 --> 38:32.268
Get in.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.317
-What happened back there?
-What happened in here?

38:51.912 --> 38:53.205
This is chaotic.

38:53.789 --> 38:54.999
You know what to do.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.676
If only you would've listened to me
when I told you something's sketchy.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.094
We didn't have another lead.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.353
Take them down.

39:18.397 --> 39:19.857
Get me out of here now.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.573
-Shit.
-What?

39:27.656 --> 39:30.159
In case you thought we lost 'em,
we didn't.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.292
-Hold tight.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.464
Can you get to Khaosan Road?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.549
-We have another safe house there.
-Yeah.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.309
Shit.

40:09.615 --> 40:10.908
It's the end of the road.

40:12.618 --> 40:14.078
Shit.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.502
Get out of the car!

40:21.585 --> 40:23.879
-She's locking down the city.
-What are we gonna do?

40:23.963 --> 40:25.131
Sail away.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.049
I'm really starting
to strongly dislike you.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.219
We get to the canal.
Take a boat up the Chao Phraya.

40:30.302 --> 40:31.554
That plan is just--

40:36.350 --> 40:37.601
<i>Stop firing.</i>

40:37.685 --> 40:40.855
Get them out of the car.
Bring them to me.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.693
I changed my mind.
I like the plan.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.528
Yeah. River, boat.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.666
-If you wanna join me, guns are up top.
-Come on.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.632
Shoot it! Let's get these fuckers!

41:30.321 --> 41:31.447
Ah, fuck. I'm all out.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.115
Shh. Shh. Shh.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.553
They're trying
to burn us alive. We gotta go!

41:56.055 --> 41:57.515
Okay. Everybody, follow me.

42:43.644 --> 42:44.853
Hey!

42:48.190 --> 42:49.775
Hey. Hey.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.088
Yo, what's up?

43:23.851 --> 43:25.352
-Oh shit!

43:54.256 --> 43:55.758
Hey!

44:24.495 --> 44:26.413
-Good timing.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.803
Never seen that before.

44:40.886 --> 44:42.930
I picked up a few things
since you ghosted me.

44:43.013 --> 44:46.058
Yeah. Well, if I'd have stayed,
it would've been behind bars, wouldn't it?

44:46.141 --> 44:47.142
This way. The river.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.359
Get out the way!

44:56.360 --> 44:57.861
Get to the boat!

45:01.990 --> 45:03.075
Get out the way!

45:06.704 --> 45:08.247
Get off my boat!

45:11.500 --> 45:12.501
Kai! Look out!

45:18.173 --> 45:20.300
-Go, go!

45:34.148 --> 45:36.108
-Get us out of here!
-Come on!

45:37.651 --> 45:39.111
Hurry, they're catching up!

45:49.413 --> 45:51.331
Faster, faster, faster! Come on!

46:14.188 --> 46:16.398
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

47:00.526 --> 47:01.693
We're almost there.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.779
It's just up ahead.

47:23.048 --> 47:24.675
Ah, Preeya!

47:24.758 --> 47:26.051
You are back.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.221
I didn't know if we'd ever see you.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.352
Everyone's excited to see you.

47:35.435 --> 47:37.104
So this is your home.

47:37.187 --> 47:40.399
-It's been a while since I was last here.
-What about your family?

47:41.650 --> 47:42.985
They were long gone before that.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.072
Um…

47:48.031 --> 47:49.199
What's this?

47:49.283 --> 47:50.868
Magical protection.

47:50.951 --> 47:53.120
If they don't want you, you can't pass.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.424
I guess they want us in.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.401
This is the home of a shaman.

48:25.068 --> 48:28.322
He knows everything
about the supernatural.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.240
If anyone might know what's going on,

48:30.908 --> 48:32.075
it's Chatree.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.912
You used to call me
a charlatan, didn't you?

48:36.246 --> 48:37.456
Uncle!

48:41.710 --> 48:43.337
It's nice to meet everyone.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.506
You all must be starving.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.508
-100%
-How'd you know?

48:50.802 --> 48:53.180
Usually,
I am the one showing hospitality.

48:53.263 --> 48:54.222
You are.

48:54.973 --> 48:57.851
It is my honor
to have such an esteemed guest.

49:01.146 --> 49:02.564
What do you know about Pan Gu?

49:03.857 --> 49:07.277
In Thailand, we don't talk business
on an empty stomach.

49:07.361 --> 49:08.362
Is that a saying?

49:09.363 --> 49:10.447
One that I just made up.

49:13.241 --> 49:14.826
There are people after us.

49:14.910 --> 49:17.371
There will always be people after you.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.206
Here we are well-protected.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.500
We have weapons.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.306
Is this a prank?

49:40.602 --> 49:41.979
No.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.522
But it is funny

49:44.189 --> 49:45.857
that this bracelet is yours.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.402
But it is not for you.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.654
You speak like Yoda, old man.

49:50.737 --> 49:51.697
Baby Yoda.

49:51.780 --> 49:55.450
I am only 50.

50:01.623 --> 50:02.541
Pan Gu.

50:04.167 --> 50:05.085
Uncle.

50:08.839 --> 50:12.843
William Pan, he wasn't, uh,
completely honest with you.

50:12.926 --> 50:14.970
Yeah? No shit.

50:18.598 --> 50:21.435
Pan and Ku An Qi are opposite forces.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.228
Yin

50:24.771 --> 50:25.981
and yang.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.151
But they are not
in opposition to each other.

50:29.234 --> 50:31.695
They are two halves of a whole.

50:31.778 --> 50:33.864
They have been working in harmony

50:33.947 --> 50:38.410
through all their births,
lives, deaths, rebirths

50:38.994 --> 50:40.454
towards one goal,

50:41.038 --> 50:42.789
reforming back to Pan Gu,

50:42.873 --> 50:43.957
the first man.

50:44.458 --> 50:48.920
And using their power,
they will remake the world in their image.

50:52.507 --> 50:55.719
And now that the Dao is broken,

50:56.386 --> 50:58.055
they have the opportunity.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.348
How will they do that?

51:00.432 --> 51:03.727
By harnessing the Chi
of the one who split them.

51:05.437 --> 51:06.521
The Wu Assassin.

51:07.522 --> 51:11.151
The two of them
each have a piece of their old Essence.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.612
The only constant they have,

51:13.695 --> 51:16.531
forged from the stone
of the temple where they were split.

51:18.200 --> 51:22.496
If they can infuse the pieces
with Kai's Chi,

51:22.579 --> 51:24.664
they will be able to connect the halves.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.124
Does it look something like this?

51:28.376 --> 51:29.544
Where did you get that from?

51:31.088 --> 51:32.798
I mean, it doesn't matter.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.716
If it's part of Ku,
we'll just destroy it--

51:36.301 --> 51:38.762
-It can't be destroyed!

51:41.765 --> 51:43.266
I've had quite enough, thank you.

51:43.350 --> 51:44.267
This…

51:45.185 --> 51:48.313
This whole thing is just crazy.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.089
-You okay?

52:19.886 --> 52:23.473
I'm just trying to wrap my head around

52:23.557 --> 52:27.811
this supernatural shit
and the world ending.

52:28.895 --> 52:29.896
Yeah.

52:36.987 --> 52:40.031
What did you do when you first found out?

52:43.910 --> 52:47.414
I had just shot
a Russian gangster in the face.

52:48.707 --> 52:50.834
So you could say
it was a little bit weird.

52:54.212 --> 52:55.172
Honestly?

52:56.339 --> 52:59.176
I poured myself a big fucking drink.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.018
-Ugh. This is terrible.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.188
Can't be worse than that Chinese
whiskey we had in Brick Lane.

53:13.523 --> 53:17.194
Yeah. Well, that was…
that was part of a job, so…

53:19.988 --> 53:21.865
-Is that what I was to you?

53:22.949 --> 53:24.201
Just part of the job.

53:34.669 --> 53:36.463
I can taste when you're lying.

53:52.103 --> 53:53.021
Training?

53:53.521 --> 53:54.689
Meditation.

53:56.983 --> 53:58.777
My meditation is meditation.

54:12.165 --> 54:14.793
-You're not worried about us losing?
-No, I'm not.

54:14.876 --> 54:18.755
Because if that should happen,
Pan Gu would remake the world,

54:19.256 --> 54:22.467
and we would simply be
the forgotten dreams of a butterfly.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.011
Sounds peaceful.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.263
But that is the one thing

54:26.972 --> 54:28.807
that the Wu Assassin can never have.

54:29.432 --> 54:33.561
He may have friends
that he's shutting out.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.897
It's my responsibility to protect them.

54:35.981 --> 54:37.190
You have lost one.

54:37.816 --> 54:39.567
And now you're trying everything

54:39.651 --> 54:41.027
to avoid that pain again.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.154
They're all I have left.

54:43.738 --> 54:47.450
But Pan Gu seeks to control all.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.453
What do you want, Wu Assassin?

54:50.954 --> 54:52.414
We'll stop him.

54:52.497 --> 54:55.000
We'll stop him. We'll make plans.

54:57.168 --> 54:58.378
There's a Jeep there.

54:59.462 --> 55:02.007
There is the path
that leads to the main road.

55:02.507 --> 55:07.262
From there, it's an easy ride to wherever.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.183
You did not come here to train

55:12.267 --> 55:13.518
or reflect.

55:16.354 --> 55:17.731
You came here to leave

55:18.523 --> 55:20.442
after everyone went to bed.

55:48.636 --> 55:52.057
Last time I was here was, um…

55:53.975 --> 55:55.393
ten years ago.

55:57.228 --> 55:59.105
Family had a farm by the river.

56:01.691 --> 56:03.318
There was a bad flood.

56:04.944 --> 56:09.741
Water came suddenly, and just like that…

56:12.410 --> 56:15.163
my mum, my dad,

56:16.664 --> 56:20.293
and my sister were gone.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.675
No magical attack.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.137
No clash for the world.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.139
It was, uh,

56:33.890 --> 56:35.183
just an accident.

56:40.021 --> 56:43.608
There's nothing I can do
to bring my family back,

56:43.691 --> 56:46.653
but I thought I could bring you
some peace for Jen.

56:46.736 --> 56:48.822
And that is why I'm helping.

56:51.783 --> 56:55.370
At least there's something you can do.

56:57.038 --> 56:58.331
You have Kai,

57:00.208 --> 57:01.376
Lu Xin.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.423
Me…

57:09.342 --> 57:10.593
I'm all alone.

57:20.687 --> 57:21.688
I'm sorry.

57:23.481 --> 57:24.649
I didn't know.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.776
Well, you never asked.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:02.599
This can't be real.

1:00:03.641 --> 1:00:04.642
It isn't.

1:00:04.726 --> 1:00:07.061
It's the version
of the village in your mind

1:00:08.062 --> 1:00:09.647
from when you were a child.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.400
But we can make it like this again.

1:00:12.483 --> 1:00:15.612
We can make it into whatever we want.

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:17.113
Pan Gu is all.

1:00:21.492 --> 1:00:24.746
Mum, Dad, Ratana!

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:28.916
-I miss you.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.294
You can be together again…

1:00:31.377 --> 1:00:32.587
-…forever.

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:34.756
All we need is one small thing.

1:00:36.674 --> 1:00:38.009
The Wu Assassin's Chi.

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:45.475
It'll be easy.

1:02:11.602 --> 1:02:13.604
-What are you doing?
-I had no choice.

1:02:13.688 --> 1:02:16.190
-What did they promise you?

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:39.422
Get up.

1:02:59.692 --> 1:03:00.818
What's going on?

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.405
What do you think?

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:30.973
I fuck with these.

1:03:32.225 --> 1:03:35.770
-There's more down there. Let's go.
-Yo! Tommy, hold up!

1:03:35.853 --> 1:03:37.146
I'll get Preeya.

1:03:37.230 --> 1:03:38.564
-What?
-Be careful, okay?

1:03:40.191 --> 1:03:45.488
I am getting really,
really sick of this shit.

1:03:48.491 --> 1:03:50.034
Tommy, get the Jeep.

1:03:50.117 --> 1:03:51.994
We'll hold them off
while Zama and Preeya get here.

1:03:52.078 --> 1:03:52.995
Preeya betrayed us.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:54.539
-No. She wouldn't.
-What?

1:03:54.622 --> 1:03:55.832
She took Ku An Qi's necklace.

1:03:56.999 --> 1:03:59.752
-Fuck.
-Lu, get Zama. Tommy, the car!

1:03:59.836 --> 1:04:01.921
-Hold on. We're stronger together.
-Just do as I say!

1:04:10.471 --> 1:04:11.347
Shit.

1:04:21.899 --> 1:04:23.192
Oh shit.

1:06:03.167 --> 1:06:04.126
Zama.

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:06.629
Preeya betrayed us. We gotta go now.

1:06:06.712 --> 1:06:09.131
I know. I saw her leave
with Pan's men. Let's go.

1:07:04.103 --> 1:07:05.104
Calm down, boys.

1:07:13.571 --> 1:07:14.989
Hyah!

1:07:54.862 --> 1:07:55.738
Ah!

1:08:15.424 --> 1:08:16.759
All right. Let's go, guys!

1:08:29.355 --> 1:08:30.856
Come on, let's go.

1:08:32.608 --> 1:08:34.110
Come on, everybody in.

1:08:37.404 --> 1:08:38.489
Hey!

1:08:43.744 --> 1:08:45.538
You can no longer be stopped.

1:08:45.621 --> 1:08:47.748
It's in your hands now. Go!

1:08:47.832 --> 1:08:49.375
Don't let Pan Gu reform!

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:51.585
-No! Chatree!
-Get in the car!

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:53.546
-We need to go!
-Drive, Tommy!

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:39.884
We shouldn't have left Chatree.

1:09:39.967 --> 1:09:43.179
-Should have listened to me.
-There wasn't anything to listen to.

1:09:43.262 --> 1:09:46.140
-I made a decision.
-Yeah. Nothing new there, Kai.

1:09:46.223 --> 1:09:49.059
-I'm leading us.
-No, you're not. You're shutting us out.

1:09:49.143 --> 1:09:51.520
Guys, let's focus on
what the fuck we're gonna do now.

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:54.398
I'm sorry. You have no right to say shit.

1:09:54.481 --> 1:09:57.067
-What the fuck you talking about?
-What do you mean?

1:09:57.151 --> 1:10:00.404
Your little girlfriend that you brought
into our inner circle betrayed us.

1:10:00.487 --> 1:10:01.780
You gonna put that on me?

1:10:01.864 --> 1:10:05.534
Sure, you weren't on the lookout either.
You were occupied fucking Zama.

1:10:06.368 --> 1:10:09.163
And, Kai, like, what the fuck?
What were you doing? What was your plan?

1:10:09.246 --> 1:10:11.123
My plan was to kill Pan and Ku myself.

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:14.251
-Like I should have done.
-Yeah? Great, 'cause you're always right.

1:10:14.335 --> 1:10:16.086
We don't need you.
I don't need any of you.

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:18.130
True! I'm going myself.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:20.591
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Just stop it!

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:22.259
All of you.

1:10:22.843 --> 1:10:24.470
You're acting like little children.

1:10:25.095 --> 1:10:26.722
Do I need to remind you

1:10:26.805 --> 1:10:30.559
that we need to stop a god
from destroying reality?

1:10:31.727 --> 1:10:33.395
You say you're a family.

1:10:34.396 --> 1:10:36.315
You're not acting like a family,

1:10:37.399 --> 1:10:39.193
not one that's about to save the world.

1:10:39.276 --> 1:10:42.029
Because you cannot
even take care of each other.

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:49.703
If you can…

1:10:52.164 --> 1:10:53.874
just get over your anger…

1:10:57.378 --> 1:10:58.671
your guilt…

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:06.011
Your ego.

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:15.020
We might actually have a chance.
We really might.

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:24.154
So, let's remind ourselves.

1:11:25.030 --> 1:11:26.323
Why are we here?

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:30.911
For Jenny.

1:11:36.041 --> 1:11:37.126
She's right.

1:11:40.546 --> 1:11:42.673
We're all fucking idiots.

1:11:42.756 --> 1:11:44.383
No, no, no, no.

1:11:45.217 --> 1:11:46.176
No.

1:11:48.095 --> 1:11:49.179
I'm the idiot.

1:11:51.223 --> 1:11:52.266
I'm a fucking idiot.

1:11:54.226 --> 1:11:56.020
For Jenny.

1:11:58.105 --> 1:12:00.190
-For Jenny.
-For Jenny.

1:12:07.990 --> 1:12:09.783
Now we're getting somewhere.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:14.538
When we were at Pan's temple,

1:12:14.621 --> 1:12:17.833
<i>I saw that splitting symbol in a photo</i>
<i>of a factory at another dig site.</i>

1:12:19.710 --> 1:12:22.629
That's where the stone came from,
so we gotta go to that dig site.

1:12:22.713 --> 1:12:25.758
But they only have
half of the symbol completed, so, like,

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:27.760
they're gonna need your power.

1:12:32.222 --> 1:12:34.058
No. We shouldn't risk it.

1:12:34.141 --> 1:12:36.393
No, no. We should. We should.

1:12:37.269 --> 1:12:41.565
Because they'll come after all of us
if we don't stop them.

1:12:44.443 --> 1:12:45.944
This ends tonight.

1:12:48.322 --> 1:12:49.698
If you all agree.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.659
As long as we're smart about it.

1:12:53.744 --> 1:12:54.787
You can count me in.

1:12:56.455 --> 1:12:58.248
-We are all the Wu Assassins.

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:01.001
Shit.

1:13:02.878 --> 1:13:04.838
-Let's go kill a god.
-Let's do it.

1:13:34.118 --> 1:13:35.577
There are a lot of guards here.

1:13:39.998 --> 1:13:41.417
<i>They'll know we're coming.</i>

1:13:42.084 --> 1:13:43.752
They already know I'm here.

1:13:46.213 --> 1:13:47.131
In that case…

1:13:47.965 --> 1:13:49.633
-Boom.

1:14:00.144 --> 1:14:03.605
This is where
the first Wu Assassin tore us apart.

1:14:03.689 --> 1:14:05.023
They'll be here soon.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:09.194
This Wu Assassin
is particularly hard to kill.

1:14:10.154 --> 1:14:12.156
I got this.

1:14:15.075 --> 1:14:17.828
This thing killed my uncle.

1:14:17.911 --> 1:14:21.415
How many more people have to die
before I get my family back?

1:14:21.498 --> 1:14:24.168
Your problem, child,
is that you see death as the end.

1:14:25.335 --> 1:14:29.006
-You'll be with them soon enough.

1:14:29.089 --> 1:14:30.924
Along with all living things.

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:40.476
That's where the stone is melted.
Those are the sleeping quarters.

1:14:40.559 --> 1:14:43.061
-Those are the main pressing machines.
-How do you know?

1:14:43.145 --> 1:14:44.104
Wikipedia.

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:49.485
We gotta be careful.
They still need you for the ritual, so…

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:52.321
Get down! Move!

1:14:58.160 --> 1:14:59.453
Zan.

1:15:02.122 --> 1:15:04.041
-What do you want to do?
-We're splitting up.

1:15:04.124 --> 1:15:06.919
Yeah. We're not divided.
We're dividing them.

1:15:09.129 --> 1:15:12.090
I got Zan. Lu, the Beast.

1:15:12.174 --> 1:15:13.717
You guys find Pan and Ku.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.511
-Fuck!

1:15:15.594 --> 1:15:17.679
Try this. It's got good range.

1:15:20.724 --> 1:15:22.351
-Be careful.
-Okay.

1:15:22.434 --> 1:15:23.435
Zan!

1:15:27.105 --> 1:15:28.482
Let's finish this.

1:16:29.626 --> 1:16:30.586
I promised myself

1:16:30.669 --> 1:16:33.422
I'd erase anything related
to when I was a pawn of your father's.

1:16:33.505 --> 1:16:34.840
We started with Jenny.

1:16:37.926 --> 1:16:40.345
And it ends when I kill you, Assassin.

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:18.842
You're not the one I'm looking for.

1:17:18.925 --> 1:17:22.012
Well, we are who you've got, bitch.

1:18:26.243 --> 1:18:29.663
The necklace isn't here.
None of this matters if we can't find it.

1:18:30.539 --> 1:18:33.333
They're not fools, Tommy.
Let's go find the others.

1:18:37.587 --> 1:18:40.298
You fucking piece of shit.

1:18:42.342 --> 1:18:44.344
-The fuck were you thinking?
-Wait. No. Stop.

1:18:45.512 --> 1:18:47.764
Hey.

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:49.516
Tell me they mind-controlled you.

1:18:49.599 --> 1:18:51.977
They told me I could see my family again,

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:56.231
and I made a mistake,
and I'm so sorry. So sorry!

1:18:56.815 --> 1:18:57.983
I messed up.

1:18:58.066 --> 1:18:59.025
Hey.

1:19:00.152 --> 1:19:02.821
It's okay. It's okay.

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:21.047
Mastery over the body has its perks.

1:19:22.883 --> 1:19:24.760
Fucking magic.

1:20:13.308 --> 1:20:14.893
-Give up.
-Never.

1:21:01.273 --> 1:21:02.816
Get up!

1:21:30.010 --> 1:21:31.970
This isn't for me.

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:34.598
This is for all of us.

1:22:10.550 --> 1:22:11.635
Welcome.

1:22:14.471 --> 1:22:15.931
-Lu Xin!
-He'll be fine.

1:22:16.014 --> 1:22:17.891
Your friends took out Ku.

1:22:17.974 --> 1:22:19.351
But you

1:22:20.602 --> 1:22:21.937
will not be so lucky.

1:23:08.566 --> 1:23:12.696
I am Pan Gu,
the first man.

1:23:12.779 --> 1:23:17.951
Control of mind, body, and soul.

1:23:43.393 --> 1:23:45.729
Lu. Lu, wait. Hey.

1:23:45.812 --> 1:23:47.605
Brother. It's not you!

1:23:49.024 --> 1:23:50.525
-Pan Gu!
- Kai.

1:23:50.608 --> 1:23:52.444
-What the fuck?

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:56.156
The trouble is, you are but one man,

1:23:56.239 --> 1:23:59.659
while I am all.

1:24:09.210 --> 1:24:11.546
Brother, I don't want to do this.

1:24:12.964 --> 1:24:15.967
Thank you
for your sacrifice.

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:20.430
No. No!

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:28.683
Lu! Lu! Lu!

1:26:28.766 --> 1:26:30.185
Fight it.

1:26:31.269 --> 1:26:32.729
We can't do this without you.

1:26:32.812 --> 1:26:34.772
Fight it, brother! Wake up!

1:26:36.107 --> 1:26:38.484
Come on, Lu! Get up!

1:26:40.528 --> 1:26:41.654
We need you, brother!

1:26:41.738 --> 1:26:43.740
Tommy.

1:26:48.411 --> 1:26:50.747
-Come on. You can do it.
-Fucking bitch.

1:26:52.165 --> 1:26:54.792
I think we've got bigger problems.
Let's go.

1:26:56.085 --> 1:26:57.170
Let's go.

1:27:03.092 --> 1:27:04.344
What the fuck happened?

1:27:04.427 --> 1:27:06.679
Is that you? Hey.

1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:10.600
Of course, it's fucking me.
Who else would it be?

1:27:10.683 --> 1:27:12.268
Nice.

1:27:14.729 --> 1:27:16.189
Let's kill this motherfucker.

1:27:16.272 --> 1:27:17.398
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1:27:31.621 --> 1:27:33.039
-Lu!

1:27:33.706 --> 1:27:35.458
-Kai!
-Lu, what's going on?

1:27:35.541 --> 1:27:38.336
-Ah, Lu! Ah!
-It's sinking!

1:27:38.419 --> 1:27:39.754
Grab that.

1:27:40.672 --> 1:27:42.048
Kai! Heads up!

1:27:44.133 --> 1:27:47.136
-I can't hold.
-Hold on. Hold on, Kai!

1:27:48.888 --> 1:27:49.806
Lu!

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:51.975
No!

1:28:01.234 --> 1:28:02.193
Lu!

1:28:10.702 --> 1:28:12.370
Stay there. Zama!

1:28:12.453 --> 1:28:13.955
-Yeah?
-Follow me.

1:28:18.793 --> 1:28:20.044
Tie that!

1:28:24.215 --> 1:28:25.133
Gotcha.

1:28:36.769 --> 1:28:38.646
-This is serious, man.
-No shit!

1:28:42.859 --> 1:28:45.278
-You guys know knots?
-We're about to find out.

1:28:45.361 --> 1:28:46.988
Girl Scout those ropes together.

1:28:49.866 --> 1:28:53.036
We'll bring 'em up with up this.
Let me know when there's enough rope.

1:28:56.622 --> 1:28:58.333
Kai, this isn't working.

1:28:58.416 --> 1:29:00.335
Come up with something.
You're the Wu Assassin.

1:29:00.418 --> 1:29:02.628
Come on! Grab it! Grab it!

1:29:08.593 --> 1:29:10.303
-Zama?
-Almost there.

1:29:17.977 --> 1:29:19.687
Let me know when you guys are good.

1:29:35.203 --> 1:29:36.788
Start pulling!

1:29:40.416 --> 1:29:42.460
Ah! It's about time.

1:29:44.212 --> 1:29:46.798
All right, guys. I need help.
Come on! Come on!

1:29:48.299 --> 1:29:49.967
Come on, Zama.

1:29:52.804 --> 1:29:54.555
Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

1:30:15.660 --> 1:30:17.453
It's over.

1:30:21.124 --> 1:30:26.421
I know a really nice,
safe passage out. Come on.

1:31:38.284 --> 1:31:39.452
Food's ready, guys.

1:31:43.581 --> 1:31:44.582
Looks good.

1:31:44.665 --> 1:31:47.710
Hold it, man. First, a toast.

1:31:47.793 --> 1:31:49.754
To family. New and old.

1:31:49.837 --> 1:31:52.298
To family. Cheers!

1:31:54.467 --> 1:31:55.551
To Jenny.

1:31:55.635 --> 1:31:57.053
To Jenny.

1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:03.351
So, Kai, what's next?

1:32:04.060 --> 1:32:06.521
-I'm off to fight a necromancer.
-Ooh!

1:32:06.604 --> 1:32:08.189
I guess we're going on vacation then.

1:32:09.023 --> 1:32:11.817
-We? I thought you could handle yourself.
-What do you mean?

1:32:11.901 --> 1:32:15.279
Oh wow. Here we go with the talk.

1:32:15.363 --> 1:32:18.533
Look, look, look,
just 'cause I kicked your ass,

1:32:18.616 --> 1:32:20.910
all of us saw it,
but we don't have to talk about it.

1:32:20.993 --> 1:32:23.371
-You wanna spar? You wanna try me?
-Do I want to spar?

1:32:23.454 --> 1:32:24.956
I don't got to prove anything to you!

1:32:25.039 --> 1:32:27.500
You're the Wu Assassin.
I'm just the Lu Assassin.

1:32:27.583 --> 1:32:29.585
-You gonna let him say that?
-Oh!

1:32:30.211 --> 1:32:31.420
Okay. Okay.

1:32:32.755 --> 1:32:35.007
-Oh my God. That's crazy.
-Guys, guys, guys.

1:32:36.342 --> 1:32:38.344
-Let's get him!
-Ah!

1:32:38.427 --> 1:32:40.388
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-He's going in.

1:32:40.471 --> 1:32:41.847
Get him in the water.
