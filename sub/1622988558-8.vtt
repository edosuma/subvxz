(guitar keeps playing)

00:44.211 --> 00:45.646
Obviously, I would learn

00:45.679 --> 00:47.247
‐how to play the guitar, but
‐(music shuts off)

00:47.281 --> 00:48.549
I think it's
a pretty achievable thing.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.417
You are a born entertainer.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.186
‐This is something, uh...
‐(guitar jangles)
‐Oops, sorry.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.388
This is something we would do
on the side, you know,

00:54.421 --> 00:57.024
uh, to add to the enigmatic
story that is Dave.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.392
Just a piece of the puzzle.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.761
Um, I think when I do that
I'd like to go by

01:00.794 --> 01:03.363
the stage name Mandemius,
and potentially

01:03.397 --> 01:05.165
(accent):
I might have a British accent

01:05.199 --> 01:07.034
if I continue to work at it

01:07.067 --> 01:08.669
and figure it out for myself.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.370
But I might have
to take dialect lessons

01:10.404 --> 01:11.438
in addition to the guitar, so...

01:11.471 --> 01:13.340
Uh, how's the actual album

01:13.373 --> 01:14.641
coming along, though, guys?

01:14.675 --> 01:15.776
The XXL stuff
just came out,

01:15.809 --> 01:17.110
and we'd like to ride

01:17.144 --> 01:18.645
‐that rapper momentum.
‐Mm.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.581
And you killed that shit,
by the way,

01:20.614 --> 01:22.282
so could be
a lot of traction.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.750
Thank you.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.587
Um, they did a good job
editorially with that.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.721
Uh, the album...

01:27.754 --> 01:30.290
How do I want to even say this?

01:30.324 --> 01:33.494
So I just want to say we do
appreciate you guys very much.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.063
‐The house is phenomenal.
‐Great.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.498
‐EXEC: Our pleasure.
‐So, so nice.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.032
I don't think we have
to pussyfoot around this.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.334
Tessa's my road dog.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.635
(barks, chuckles)

01:41.668 --> 01:43.370
So here's what's going on.

01:43.403 --> 01:46.540
Penith is a bear, um,

01:46.573 --> 01:48.275
and I'm a gorilla.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.044
Don't get me wrong,
but what I'm finding out is that

01:51.078 --> 01:52.646
when bears and gorillas,

01:52.679 --> 01:56.316
‐you know... you can't
crossbreed all the time.
‐Mm.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.119
I am trying to play God.
I'm realizing that might be

01:59.152 --> 02:01.221
too much hubric of me.

02:01.255 --> 02:04.258
So I am struggling

02:04.291 --> 02:06.326
with the behemoth
that is Penith.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.729
Uh, how much of it
would you say is done, though?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.532
‐Done done?
‐Yeah, done done.
Percentage‐wise.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.501
Done done. Uh...
♪ Dun dun dun. ♪

02:14.535 --> 02:18.705
Um, I've got, like,
four half songs

02:18.739 --> 02:20.507
that I don't believe in at all.

02:20.541 --> 02:24.044
So I don't even count those
as a... so...

02:24.077 --> 02:25.245
Nothing.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.281
‐Um...
‐Zero?

02:27.314 --> 02:30.517
Yeah.
I do have six folk songs

02:30.551 --> 02:32.252
that are incredible.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.254
‐The wrong genre, but...
‐Um...

02:34.288 --> 02:36.223
Especially since that
album release date is

02:36.256 --> 02:37.991
closely approaching.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.295
How much time, like,
do you think you might need?

02:41.328 --> 02:44.264
Yeah, we might need to do a
little bit of a nudge there, uh,

02:44.298 --> 02:46.133
but if we're being conservative,
I don't...

02:46.166 --> 02:47.701
A year.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.337
Daylight savings time has been
really throwing me off

02:50.370 --> 02:51.405
‐with the darkness.
‐TESSA: Right.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.640
Yeah, I think we'll just focus

02:53.674 --> 02:55.375
on some housekeeping stuff then.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.579
Housekeeping, great.
I‐I would love a housekeeper.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.448
‐(Dave straining)
‐CAROL: A right at the top
of the stairs,

03:01.481 --> 03:02.683
and then another right.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.384
Don't hit the sconce.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.620
‐Don't hit the Sconce.
‐Okay, I'm not.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.222
You have your own bathroom.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.123
I think you're gonna like
the water pressure.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.426
DON:
You know, David always took
the longest showers.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.494
MIKE:
Yeah, I can imagine.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.162
Aw, geez, I just can't believe

03:15.195 --> 03:16.597
you got fired from that label.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.999
Mom, I didn't get fired
from a record label.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.468
‐I don't work at a record label.
‐MIKE: No, he got evicted.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.137
Which is much worse
because it directly affects me.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.106
It's the entertainment industry.
Some people lack patience.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.741
They don't understand
what this is, fine.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.077
The chip on my shoulder
just grows larger, okay?

03:30.110 --> 03:31.178
What is this room, by the way?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.513
It's like a little girl's room.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
‐Yeah.
‐CAROL: It's an Airbnb.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.650
It's so naïve.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.285
Well...

03:38.318 --> 03:39.586
Mama, can you make me
a sandwich?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.154
Of course, sweetheart.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.457
Do you want it in triangles?
You got it.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.359
‐DAVE: Thanks, Mama.
‐You're welcome.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.495
(sarcastically):
"Mama. Mama, will you make me
some sandwiches?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.197
"And cut it up so my baby teeth

03:50.230 --> 03:51.431
can get through this bread,
maybe?"

03:51.465 --> 03:52.432
‐CAROL: Michael?
‐Yeah?

03:52.466 --> 03:53.667
Would you like a sandwich?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.135
Yeah, please.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.436
‐CAROL: Okay.
‐Thank you.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.407
Hey, man.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.477
I don't think you're a failure.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.681
I... Yeah. I don't think
I'm a failure either.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.049
Why would you‐‐
I don't‐‐

04:09.082 --> 04:10.651
I didn't think you thought that.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.521
Okay. Good.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.564
(vehicle approaching)

04:29.136 --> 04:30.470
Sorry.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.573
I got caught on this, like,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.241
endless FaceTime
with my sister.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.709
It was a whole thing, and...

04:35.742 --> 04:37.277
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.613
‐How are you?
‐Good.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.481
You know, a little bit
of a setback.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.016
But...

04:43.050 --> 04:44.585
Are you having a good time

04:44.618 --> 04:46.453
living with your
favorite people again?

04:46.486 --> 04:49.089
Uh, yeah. I feel like
I'm, like, you know,

04:49.122 --> 04:50.424
reduced to my core.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.459
I'm back, uh,
finding my roots.

04:52.493 --> 04:56.096
Just wish it could be under
less embarrassing circumstances.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.366
It's not embarrassing, Dave.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.634
I was literally
kicked out of my house

05:00.667 --> 05:02.102
for lack of productivity.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.637
(chuckling)
Okay, I know that you

05:03.670 --> 05:05.706
have a very specific plan
for how everything

05:05.739 --> 05:08.208
is supposed to go,
and that this is

05:08.242 --> 05:11.044
‐not part of that, probably.
‐Mm.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.014
But it's just a detour.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.251
Yeah, just a detour.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.489
Well, I guess
you probably don't want

05:22.523 --> 05:24.324
your, uh, housewarming gifts.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.493
‐You got me gifts?
‐Yeah.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.762
Come on.
Come to my, uh, my car,

05:28.795 --> 05:30.364
where I have the gifts located.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.398
‐Come on.
‐Sure.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.533
‐I'm in pursuit.
‐Yeah.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.369
100% authentic gifts.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.305
‐There's multiple?
‐Yeah. And this...

05:42.242 --> 05:44.244
What‐what is this?

05:44.278 --> 05:48.148
What is this?
It's a headband for your hair.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.383
Like you've always wanted.
You're always like,

05:49.416 --> 05:51.118
‐"Aah, my hair."
‐Am I saying that?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.487
It was custom‐made for you.
So try it on.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.088
Okay. Huh.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.524
Oh. Oh, my God.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.092
‐Do I look good in this?
‐Stunning.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.594
‐You look amazing!
‐Is this a good look?

06:00.627 --> 06:03.630
You should be a professional
fuckin' Halloween player

06:03.664 --> 06:06.300
‐for soccer.
‐What?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.535
And... Okay, got it.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.570
(whoops)

06:09.603 --> 06:12.039
This is the big one.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.373
‐Get ready.
‐Ooh, I gotta get
out of your way.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.709
‐(laughs) Are you ready?
‐Yeah.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.177
(exhales)

06:18.512 --> 06:20.280
(laughs)

06:20.314 --> 06:22.616
‐Did you really?
‐I did.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.485
You have truly outdone yourself.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.421
‐Yeah.
‐You have gotten me
the worst gift

06:27.454 --> 06:29.256
a man could receive.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.591
I mean, I can't even
blow up a balloon.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.025
‐Okay.
‐You know that.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.293
‐I did forget that you sa‐‐
‐I can't.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.661
But I also don't think
that's true,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.530
‐try it.
‐You think I li‐‐

06:36.563 --> 06:38.398
Now you sound like the bullies
that I had to deal with

06:38.432 --> 06:39.666
who said, "This guy can't
blow up a balloon."

06:39.700 --> 06:41.435
I can't.
I have a slack jaw.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.103
Okay, then give it to me,
and I will give it to someone

06:43.136 --> 06:44.471
who can blow it.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.406
That's unfair. I can use
the gift any way I want.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.242
Dave...

06:48.275 --> 06:50.744
It's mine. I appreciate
all these gifts.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.379
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.014
You can just Venmo me.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.115
‐No.
‐(snorts)

06:58.552 --> 07:01.588
You can't blame me for
every raisin that you se

07:01.622 --> 07:03.524
‐Have you guys seen
my laptop anywhere?
‐We both eat raisins.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.492
‐I haven't seen it.
‐I'm not blaming you
for every raisin,

07:05.526 --> 07:07.060
‐just these three.
‐Yeah, and what, do they
have my name on it?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.228
‐(rap music playing)
‐What are you doing?

07:08.262 --> 07:09.296
DON:
What about that cashew?

07:09.329 --> 07:10.330
Please get off of my laptop.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.431
I was listening to the records

07:11.465 --> 07:13.066
that you made this past year.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.034
‐(music shuts off)
‐No, Dave, you can't keep me

07:14.067 --> 07:15.068
in the dark anymore, man.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.236
This is none of your business.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.039
This is literally
my only business.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.209
At least let me try
and help you.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.312
You're not even
in the right folder.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.047
Okay, well, where do I go?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.216
"Penith possibilities."

07:29.249 --> 07:30.484
"Penith poss‐‐"

07:30.517 --> 07:32.719
‐Possibilities.
‐I get it.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.322
There's no organization to this.
You're playing stuff at random.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.723
Okay, what's‐what's "Me Too"?

07:36.757 --> 07:41.161
‐"Me Too" is a radical...
‐Let's hear it.

07:41.195 --> 07:44.031
♪ You wanna cuddle
in my bed? Me, too ♪

07:44.064 --> 07:46.733

‐Okay, do you know
what's going on

07:56.677 --> 07:58.478
‐right now in the world?
‐Yeah, what? I don't...

07:58.512 --> 08:00.113
‐I don't think it's a good idea.
‐I just think that's, like,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.048
the worst thing
you could ever have thought.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.049
Yeah, I don't like it.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.183
Okay, what about "Jenkum"?

08:03.217 --> 08:04.585
‐What is "Jenkum"?
‐Ooh.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.353
It's a sweet spot in my heart.
Jenkum is, uh,

08:06.386 --> 08:08.388
when you take shit and
you put it in a plastic bag...

08:08.422 --> 08:10.123
‐Okay, that's enough.
‐...and you let it ferment.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.325
‐And you huff it, and you...
‐I don't need to hear it.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.626
What about "Ally's Song"?

that's all I need.

met for the first time.

David, is this a punk?
‐Mm‐hmm, yep.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.030
Am I a punk?

I think you don't understand
that phrase, but...

19:25.199 --> 19:27.568
‐Come on, Mama.
‐Oh, my God, David,
what did you do?

‐Oh, God.

It's about you and Don's love
and tapping back into it.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.285
Come on, it's a romantic dinner.

19:45.319 --> 19:47.721
You know, I was listening

19:47.754 --> 19:50.190
to my tapes
and I saw him making it,

19:50.224 --> 19:52.159
but I'm probably
just as surprised as you are.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.394
‐A little bit of wine.
‐Very elegant.

19:54.428 --> 19:57.130
Yeah, learned it from the best.
I'm gonna put the fireplace on.

19:57.164 --> 19:59.333
He's just trying
to create a romantic...

19:59.366 --> 20:01.068
‐No, what he's trying to do,
‐...dinner.

20:01.101 --> 20:02.536
but I was sleeping...

20:02.569 --> 20:05.606
Oh, my God.
You have sauce all over you.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.208
‐Wipe that off.
‐All right, all right.

20:08.242 --> 20:09.743
Well, you know,
why do you throw things

20:09.776 --> 20:11.411
‐at me like that?
‐(stammering)

20:11.445 --> 20:12.579

20:14.047 --> 20:15.549
I'm not watching
you guys bicker anymore.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.751
David, we've been married
for 30 years. It's normal, okay?

20:17.784 --> 20:20.487
Well, when you do it
in front of me,

20:20.521 --> 20:22.422
it makes me sad.

20:22.456 --> 20:25.259
Oh, for God's sake.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.161
Grow up.
You're almost 30 years old.

20:27.194 --> 20:29.096
Stop being so selfish.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.398
What are you talking...

20:31.431 --> 20:33.033
‐(Carol sighs)
‐How am I being selfish

20:33.066 --> 20:34.468
if I just made you
your favorite dinner?

20:34.501 --> 20:36.036
‐I don't understand.
‐My‐my favorite dinner?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.404
‐Yeah, company chicken,
‐Company chicken?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.705
‐and I spent so much time.
‐I don't...

20:38.739 --> 20:40.974
I don't like company chicken,
David.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.745
‐You make it every single time
company comes over.
‐I make it for you

20:44.778 --> 20:47.181
because you love it.
I make it for you, not me.

20:47.214 --> 20:49.283
Well,
how am I supposed to know that?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.751
You sit there
and you eat it every time.

20:50.784 --> 20:52.719
And I still am
failing to realize

20:52.753 --> 20:54.555
how me making you a whole meal
is me being selfish.

20:54.588 --> 20:56.757
‐Explain that.
‐Oh, my God, David!

20:56.790 --> 20:59.026
You just woke me up.

20:59.059 --> 21:01.028
You brought me down here
and did all of this.

21:01.061 --> 21:03.297
That was not for me.
That was for you.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.065
‐It was for you guys.
‐That was...

21:05.098 --> 21:08.135
David, that was for you, because
you wanted to feel better.

21:08.168 --> 21:10.037
I wanted to show you pictures
from Egypt,

21:10.070 --> 21:11.572
but you weren't interested.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.173
‐Oh, my God. Egypt?
‐You had other things to do.

21:13.207 --> 21:15.042
You came down late for dinner.
I asked you...

21:15.075 --> 21:17.177
‐I was 90 seconds late!
‐You wanted to take a shower,

21:17.211 --> 21:18.579
‐Jesus Christ!
‐so you were late.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.581
Everything's a fucking issue
with you!

21:20.614 --> 21:23.217
‐David, that's enough.
‐No, Dad. Like,
she's always riding you.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.585
It's, like, nonstop with her.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.054

Okay? Sit down.

26:24.084 --> 26:27.254
I‐I've just been thinking
a lot...

26:27.287 --> 26:29.523
No, Dave, I'm...

26:29.556 --> 26:33.293
I spent a lot of time
and a lot of work

26:33.327 --> 26:36.430
to get over us.

26:36.463 --> 26:38.732
And I've moved on.

26:39.733 --> 26:42.336
And you're back in my life,
and we're friends.

26:42.369 --> 26:45.272
And I don't want to lose that,
either, but...

26:45.305 --> 26:47.374
I'm...

26:54.448 --> 26:56.450
I can't.

26:59.419 --> 27:01.321
No.

27:01.355 --> 27:03.423
It's just a song.

27:04.391 --> 27:06.460
This wasn't...

27:06.493 --> 27:08.629
‐Yeah.
‐Oh, my God.

27:08.662 --> 27:11.098
It's‐‐ I should've, uh...
clarified.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.367
‐No, you said you...
‐I know. Ah...

27:13.400 --> 27:15.102
‐...wanted to talk, and it's...
‐Yeah.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.603
I didn't‐‐ I‐‐ Sorry.

27:16.637 --> 27:19.540
So, like, I obviously tapped
into, like, feelings

27:19.573 --> 27:21.508
and, you know, of wanting
to be back with your ex.

27:21.542 --> 27:23.544
‐Right.
‐Right. Sorry. Uh...

27:23.577 --> 27:25.245
And I just know that
I haven't always taken

27:25.279 --> 27:27.714
your feelings into account,
like, for our whole,

27:27.748 --> 27:29.449
your know,
in terms of my music.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.686
So I just wanted you
to hear that, and, um...

27:32.719 --> 27:34.188
That's all.

27:34.221 --> 27:35.489
'Cause I want to put it
on my album,

27:35.522 --> 27:36.590
and I didn't want you
to be blindsided.

27:36.623 --> 27:37.658
And I wanted your...

27:37.691 --> 27:39.459
So, that's all that was.

27:39.493 --> 27:42.129
‐I'm sorry for the...
‐No. I'm sorry.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.097
‐Okay. Sure.
‐And thank you.

27:44.131 --> 27:46.400
I will say,
if I'm being honest,

27:46.433 --> 27:51.672
I'm not ready
for everyone to hear this song.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.741
I'm sorry.

27:54.775 --> 27:57.778
‐I know you worked really hard
on it, and it is good.
‐(chuckles)

27:57.811 --> 28:00.781
Uh, yeah, okay.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.449
Why?

28:02.482 --> 28:06.153
There's a lot of personal stuff
in here, Dave.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.589
‐That's music. That's like‐‐
‐And there's a lot of
things about me.

28:08.622 --> 28:10.591
And people know
that you and I dated.

28:10.624 --> 28:12.092
‐It's, like,
a privacy thing, and...
‐People? Who?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.228
What people? Like,
the 15 friends that we‐‐

28:14.261 --> 28:16.497
‐I don't understand.
‐I don't need
your Instagram fans

28:16.530 --> 28:18.098
‐(groans)
‐having more of a reason
to harass me also, and...

28:18.131 --> 28:20.334
Instagram?
You're worried about Instagram?

28:20.367 --> 28:23.003
I'm sorry, but it's so hard
for me to make music.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.638
I finally have something
that I like,

28:24.671 --> 28:28.242
and you're not allowing me
to do it because of Instagram?

28:28.275 --> 28:30.477
‐That's like...
‐So...

28:30.511 --> 28:33.146
you're taking my feelings
into account,

28:33.180 --> 28:36.183
unless you don't have
my permission?

28:36.216 --> 28:38.552
‐I'm ju‐‐ Like.
‐And then you're gonna do
whatever.

28:38.585 --> 28:41.355
If‐if art couldn't tap into,
like, personal feelings

28:41.388 --> 28:44.191
and, like, nuanced emotions
about, like, past experiences,

28:44.224 --> 28:47.594
like, there wouldn't be art,
you know?

28:47.628 --> 28:50.197
Don't you know what I'm saying?

28:50.230 --> 28:52.499
I don't know. I mean,
we can talk about it more,

28:52.533 --> 28:54.601
or not, it's just...

28:56.570 --> 28:59.373
Whatever.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.608
Let's just watch the show.

29:05.445 --> 29:07.481
