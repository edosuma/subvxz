00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(silence)

00:04.605 --> 00:07.439
(fire whooshing)

00:25.559 --> 00:28.193
(wind howling)

01:50.878 --> 01:54.079
(slow dramatic music)

03:08.689 --> 03:11.256
(man coughing)

03:17.364 --> 03:20.866
(slow suspenseful music)

03:47.628 --> 03:48.527
- What?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.121
(man screaming)

04:16.123 --> 04:19.191
(creature growling)

04:46.553 --> 04:49.354
(dramatic music)

04:57.464 --> 04:59.965
(slow music)

05:08.542 --> 05:09.474
- I ought to drag you out there

05:09.476 --> 05:10.842
and feed you to those things.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.645
(dramatic music)

05:16.583 --> 05:17.482
- Nat.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.653
You don't want to be here,

05:28.662 --> 05:29.711
you should leave.

05:29.712 --> 05:30.761
You can't spend your
birthday like this.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.232
- Don't really have a choice.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.568
- Come on, you
always have a choice.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.137
- They don't just let you
walk out the front door.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.709
And anyway, you need keycards
to get anywhere in this place.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.876
- Yeah, I know.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.580
- What about Tim?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.523
- So you are interested?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.292
It's one weekend.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.693
We'll bring you back after.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.331
They'll tell you off, tell
you not to do it again.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.734
Then they'll forget about it.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.104
- No. (laughs)

06:12.106 --> 06:13.605
- Was that a smile?
- Mm.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.773
- All right, good.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.674
We're doing it.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.312
Hey, Tim.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.381
- Ethan, what can I do for ya?

06:22.383 --> 06:25.384
- Well, the thing is it's
Nat's birthday today and.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.620
- Ooh, take those away from me.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.454
- Oh, go on, Tim.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.455
They're just cupcakes.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.290
- I'd love to but I can't.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.658
Me missus would kill me.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.559
- That's a shame.

06:35.796 --> 06:36.895
Well just have a look at them.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.796
- No.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.067
Ethan, I'm telling you
right now point blank

06:42.069 --> 06:43.301
there's absolutely no chance

06:43.303 --> 06:45.404
of putting one of those
cupcakes in my mouth.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.273
- You're going to
have to pretend.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.182
- So, what you been up to, lad?

06:57.184 --> 07:00.218
- I got a new car the other day.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.153
Well, an old car.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.187
The thing barely starts.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.121
- How come?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.356
- Well, it's got this switch

07:04.358 --> 07:05.424
that keeps cutting
off the engine.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.658
- Oh dear.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.859
- It's there for
crashing actually.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.128
Mine's broken so
it keeps going off.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.763
And the reset button's
under the bonnet

07:11.765 --> 07:12.998
so I keep getting out of the car

07:13.000 --> 07:14.733
and pressing this red button.

07:14.735 --> 07:18.236
And this is boring so I'm going
to stop talking about this.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.375
But it's just over here if
you want to have a look.

07:23.377 --> 07:24.276
- Go on then.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.314
- [Ethan] It's just over there.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.415
Oh, so sorry.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.050
- Bloody hell.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.052
No, no, it's all right, lad.

07:34.054 --> 07:34.953
I'll get it.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.961
(dramatic music)

07:45.232 --> 07:46.131
Oi.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.271
- Go.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.541
- Don't be so bloody stupid.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.549
Oi.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.323
You're making a mistake.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.433
(woman grunting)

08:21.435 --> 08:22.367
- I'm sorry.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.035
- Come on, let's go.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.909
(dramatic music)

08:36.283 --> 08:37.749
Wait, right here.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.086
- What are we going to do?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.821
- Come on, this way.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.095
- I'll get ya.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.784
Susan, phone the police.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.419
A psych patient's escaped.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.601
- Go, go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.175
- Hold on.

09:39.947 --> 09:40.845
Come on.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.520
Yes, yes.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.656
Let's go.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.832
(mid-tempo synthesizer music)

10:45.812 --> 10:48.446
(upbeat music)

11:05.098 --> 11:08.500
¶ The city springs
nightflowers ¶

11:08.502 --> 11:12.003
¶ We'll drip away the hours ¶

11:12.005 --> 11:15.473
¶ The crowd just melts away ¶

11:15.475 --> 11:18.476
¶ Now endless trailers play ¶

11:18.478 --> 11:20.912
(slow music)

12:11.798 --> 12:14.165
- Pippa, you were supposed to
push the pegs into the ground.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.867
Can't you do anything?

12:15.869 --> 12:16.735
- Uh-huh.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.204
- You're not even
listening to me.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.371
Come and help.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.207
- Tents aren't
really like my thing.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.041
Cam can help.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.542
- [Cam] I am helping.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.578
- Well, Mike can
help then, whatever.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.214
- Pippa, please, would you
put that flipping thing away.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.219
- Teddy?
- Yeah.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.055
- Oh my God, you
actually came. (laughs)

12:37.057 --> 12:38.456
haven't seen you
in like 50 years.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.091
Where have you been, mister?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.826
- Oh, here and there, you know.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.361
- Oh, you look so different.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.796
Loving the beard.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.064
- Cheers.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.633
- Cam, this is Nat's
elusive big brother.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.467
- You all right, mate?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.335
- What's up?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.536
- That's Mike.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.403
He's quiet.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.275
- So, Teddy, what do
you think of the plan?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.443
- What plan?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.377
- Oh, I don't know.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.979
Maybe Ethan's ridiculous scheme

13:00.981 --> 13:03.181
to break Natasha
out of hospital.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.216
I love Natasha, I really do.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.886
But she's been
sectioned for a reason

13:07.888 --> 13:09.954
and I think people
keep forgetting that.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.157
- I don't know.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.260
- Frances, learn to be
a bit more adventurous.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.961
- You didn't even
want to come camping.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.363
- All I'm saying is my house

13:18.365 --> 13:21.499
is a lot cleaner
than this campsite.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.567
This is fine though.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.037
Unless you guys want
to go to my house?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.906
Shall we go to my house?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.175
- Your house is one of the
first places they'll look.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.509
You tit.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.145
Teddy, ask me if Pippa's a tit.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.080
- Oh, okay.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.384
Is Pippa a--
- Yes, she is!

13:39.386 --> 13:42.220
Now can we please just
get this fucking tent up.

13:42.222 --> 13:48.326
- Pippa, so, what
does she think of me?

13:49.296 --> 13:50.195
- It's not good.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.197
- What do you mean?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.364
Is she still mad?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.265
It's been ages.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.969
- [Cam] Guys, they're here.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.338
- Could you maybe
talk to her for me?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.375
(mid-tempo music)

14:10.917 --> 14:12.550
- Woo!

14:12.552 --> 14:15.453
Oh my God, happy birthday.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.755
Oh, it's so good to see you.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.656
- Good to see you.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.991
- Oh.
- Hey, bud.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.463
- Nat, oh, it's so
good to see you.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.865
Happy Birthday.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.234
- Oh, all right. (laughs)

14:29.236 --> 14:30.501
- Like, how are you feeling?

14:30.503 --> 14:31.502
- Well, can't complain.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.971
I've tried.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.272
Nobody listens, so.

14:34.274 --> 14:39.043
- You look so, oh, this
is so exciting. (laughs)

14:39.713 --> 14:42.847
(slow dramatic music)

15:12.512 --> 15:14.679
I think you should at
least give him a chance.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.348
Nat?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.588
- Pippa, you finished
those forms yet?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.489
- Ah.

15:25.959 --> 15:26.791
- Pippa.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.692
- I've been busy.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.661
- Doing what?

15:29.663 --> 15:30.628
- I put the tent up.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.863
- [Frances] No, you didn't.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.965
- Well, I put the
fairy lights up.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.366
- No, you didn't.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.634
- Ethan, please just
fill in the forms.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.869
It'll literally take one second.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.504
- Stop, just stop, please.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.574
- Teddy Bear, you'll fill
in the forms, won't you?

15:43.576 --> 15:47.946
- Yeah, go on then.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.649
(Ethan sighs)

15:52.485 --> 15:54.953
(slow music)

16:13.873 --> 16:15.473
- Seen the lake yet?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.774
It's beautiful.

16:18.011 --> 16:21.379
Mum was asking after
you, by the way.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.414
We're really glad
you're still with us.

16:25.151 --> 16:30.388
Look, I got you this,
a birthday present.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.224
- Frances, you really
didn't have to.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.265
- Please keep fighting.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.268
It'll be worth it.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.170
And you might not be
so lucky next time,

16:46.172 --> 16:47.605
so don't you dare do it again.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.908
- Jesus fucking Christ,
Frances, just leave her alone.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.482
(guitar pinging)

17:00.086 --> 17:01.285
- No.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.253
- Just takes the
forms to the house.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.321
- In these wedges?

17:03.323 --> 17:04.589
- They just aren't exactly

17:04.591 --> 17:06.724
appropriate camping
footwear, are they?

17:06.726 --> 17:07.925
What if you decide
to go on a hike

17:07.927 --> 17:09.460
and we have to get
somewhere in a hurry,

17:09.462 --> 17:11.529
or you actually had to run?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.765
- We're at a campsite in
the middle of nowhere.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.466
Why would I need to run?

17:15.468 --> 17:18.970
(guitar pinging)

17:18.972 --> 17:19.804
- Just take the forms.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.239
- Come with me?

17:21.241 --> 17:22.173
- Fine.
- Hm.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.211
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.333
- [Cam] No.

17:52.038 --> 17:52.870
(door knocking)

17:52.872 --> 17:56.007
(slow dramatic music)

17:56.009 --> 17:58.342
- Oh, creepy house, isn't it?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.877
- Not really.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.852
(mallet thudding)

18:07.854 --> 18:10.588
(door knocking)

18:11.024 --> 18:11.923
What's taking him so long?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.024
Does he want his forms or what?

18:13.026 --> 18:14.625
- Well just go in.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.027
- I can't just go into
another man's house.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.029
- Oh yeah?

18:18.031 --> 18:19.397
Come on.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.735
(mallet thudding)

18:36.783 --> 18:37.682
Hello?

18:41.855 --> 18:42.820
Hello?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.689
(mallet thudding)

18:44.691 --> 18:47.758
(suspenseful music)

19:04.744 --> 19:05.643
Ethan.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.347
Ethan, can we go?

19:10.416 --> 19:13.718
This place is super
creepy. (gasps)

19:15.455 --> 19:17.822
- You come into my home
and insult my thing.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.223
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.158
I didn't--

19:20.160 --> 19:21.392
- I was just fooling with you.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.728
It's somewhat of
an acquired taste.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.398
- Hello.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.366
Hi.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.367
- Blackwood.
- Ethan.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.768
- What can I do for you?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.637
- Here's the forms
you asked us for.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.772
- What brings you here?

19:34.774 --> 19:37.108
- Just here for a
girlfriend's birthday.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.042
- Yeah, but we're not together.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.210
- Nah, someone else.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.111
- He tried.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.780
(slow music)

19:42.782 --> 19:44.115
- Well isn't that nice.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.172
- Well if it isn't
the birthday girl.

20:09.943 --> 20:14.912
So, you okay and everything?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.714
- [Nat] Yeah, living
the dream, me.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.750
- You know, I think the
last time we went camping

20:19.752 --> 20:23.588
was the last time
I saw Mum healthy.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.769
Yeah, I didn't know
you were so, you know.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.477
I would have come back.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.378
You know that, right?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.115
- No you wouldn't.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.701
(slow music)

21:18.077 --> 21:20.578
(Cam grunts)

21:24.884 --> 21:28.452
(Cam laughing)

21:28.454 --> 21:30.254
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.360
I reckon this guy likes burgers.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.263
You all right, mate?

21:40.199 --> 21:43.234
Check out these bad boys, huh?

21:43.236 --> 21:45.569
The owner up at the house,
he's giving away free burgers,

21:45.571 --> 21:46.837
isn't he, Mike?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.574
So yeah, if you want you can go

21:50.576 --> 21:53.110
and get some free
burgers from him.

21:53.112 --> 21:53.978
Or not.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.714
It's up to you I suppose.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.749
I just thought I'd let you know.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.786
- Doesn't strike me as a
particularly smart idea.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.061
(man sniffs)

22:15.268 --> 22:16.167
- Okay.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.202
Cool, man.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.772
We're going to go, but cheers.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.919
(mid-tempo music)

22:41.027 --> 22:43.394
("Tequila")

23:35.448 --> 23:36.614
- No thanks.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.782
- Baby, what's
wrong with my meat?

23:37.784 --> 23:38.949
- You don't know
where that came from.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.618
- Yeah, I do.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.686
It came from an old man.

23:42.688 --> 23:43.554
- They smell funny.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.556
- Yet taste magnificent.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.259
- Well how come Mike
doesn't have to eat one?

23:48.261 --> 23:49.226
- Mike's vegan.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.467
(Pippa sighs)

24:01.607 --> 24:02.640
- Oh my God.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.909
They're actually really good.

24:04.911 --> 24:05.743
- Woo!

24:05.745 --> 24:06.577
("Tequila")

24:06.579 --> 24:08.312
Hail to the chef, baby!

24:26.632 --> 24:28.532
¶ Tequila ¶

24:31.871 --> 24:34.538
(Pippa laughs)

24:36.375 --> 24:38.509
- Does it feel weird
watching your brother

24:38.511 --> 24:40.311
trying to get with
your best friend?

24:42.515 --> 24:43.581
Are you glad you came?

24:43.583 --> 24:45.049
- Nah.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.017
I think I preferred
the loony bin.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.420
- Oh.

24:49.422 --> 24:52.323
So you don't want
your present then?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.226
- What is it?

24:55.228 --> 24:56.427
- It's in the car.

24:56.429 --> 24:58.028
I'll get it for you later.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.531
(slow music)

25:02.802 --> 25:05.369
- Actually, everyone.

25:05.371 --> 25:10.441
I want to say I know
I've been a bit...

25:14.647 --> 25:19.717
Basically I want you all to
know that I love you guys and--

25:22.922 --> 25:24.722
(dramatic music)

25:24.724 --> 25:26.090
- Very sweet.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.360
- Where the fuck
did you come from?

25:29.362 --> 25:31.795
- I hate to do this but I'm
going to have to ask you

25:31.797 --> 25:32.730
to tie yourselves up.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.564
(slow dramatic music)

25:33.566 --> 25:34.698
- What?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.300
- Tie yourselves up.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.401
It's a simple request.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.302
- No.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.740
- What are you talking about?

25:42.742 --> 25:43.674
- Help.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.942
Somebody fucking help us.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.143
- Now I'm going to
start cutting bits

25:46.145 --> 25:47.912
off of each of you,

25:47.914 --> 25:50.881
bits I promise you
you're going to miss,

25:50.883 --> 25:52.716
unless you do as you're told

25:52.718 --> 25:54.752
and tie yourselves the fuck up.

26:01.494 --> 26:04.094
Listen carefully 'cause I'm
only going to say this once

26:04.096 --> 26:07.298
and I'm sure as shit you're
going to want to hear it.

26:08.367 --> 26:12.803
There's something in
these woods, a monster.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.907
And I'm not speaking
metaphorically.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.543
I mean, there's an
actually fucking monster

26:19.545 --> 26:21.211
living in these woods.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.815
And this monster hunts down
cannibals and eats them alive.

26:24.817 --> 26:29.253
And believe me, it makes
a real fucking mess.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.890
That's why the
monster's after me.

26:32.892 --> 26:37.861
And now that you've eaten
my burgers, it's after you.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.697
- What are you talking about?

26:39.699 --> 26:40.864
- My burgers.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.102
I made them from some hikers.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.036
- Oh yuck.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.839
- Nice couple, good with kids.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.407
- Why?

26:50.409 --> 26:53.544
- If I feed it, it leaves
me alone for a while.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.778
So that's what I do.

26:56.082 --> 27:00.084
I make cannibals and I feed it.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.654
Which brings me
to my next point.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.925
Your fat fucking
friend over here.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.265
Hey there, big guy.

27:16.502 --> 27:17.368
- Hey.

27:17.370 --> 27:18.936
- Didn't fancy
eating my burgers?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.706
I'm going to need
you to eat one now.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.442
- I'm vegan.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.910
- Oh, that doesn't
matter anymore.

27:28.547 --> 27:29.813
Eat the fucking meat.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.919
Chew, swallow.

27:38.891 --> 27:39.857
Swallow.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.426
Eat your fucking mouth.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.095
(Mike gagging)

27:50.936 --> 27:52.736
You really should
have eaten that.

27:52.738 --> 27:53.570
(gun firing)

27:53.572 --> 27:54.405
(people screaming)

27:54.407 --> 27:59.476
- [Teddy] Jesus Christ!

28:00.246 --> 28:01.912
- Fuck, shit, fuck.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.816
Oh shit. (screams)

28:05.818 --> 28:06.850
(woman screaming)

28:06.852 --> 28:09.887
- No, Cam!

28:09.889 --> 28:11.755
- Did you really think I'd
risk telling you all that

28:11.757 --> 28:16.160
is there were a single fucking
thing you could do about it?

28:16.162 --> 28:19.163
(Frances whimpers)

28:27.640 --> 28:30.040
- What the fuck is he doing?

28:34.413 --> 28:37.247
(people gagging)

28:38.884 --> 28:41.985
- Now get up.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.253
We're going for a drive.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.358
(suspenseful music)

29:17.857 --> 29:18.689
- Where are you taking us?

29:18.691 --> 29:20.457
- He's a fucking cock.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.358
Teddy.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.459
- Yeah.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.161
- Ask me if he's a fucking cock.

29:24.163 --> 29:27.498
- Um, is he--
- Yes, Teddy, he fucking is!

29:27.500 --> 29:28.966
- Nat, Nat.

29:28.968 --> 29:29.900
- Yeah.

29:29.902 --> 29:30.701
- Do you have your lighter?

29:30.703 --> 29:32.703
- Yeah, it's in my boot.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.308
- Turn around.

30:10.743 --> 30:12.910
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

30:22.688 --> 30:23.854
- I'm going to kill the fucker.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.089
- Just stay calm.
- Ssh, ssh.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.991
- I think he's--
- Ssh.

30:27.993 --> 30:31.995
(suspenseful electronic music)

30:37.102 --> 30:38.268
Try the door.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.555
(slow suspenseful music)

31:28.320 --> 31:29.753
- Keys are gone.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.121
- He can't have gone far.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.789
Let's get the fuck out.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.157
Come on!

31:34.159 --> 31:35.325
- Where are you going?

31:36.495 --> 31:37.895
Cam!

31:37.897 --> 31:38.962
Cam, come back.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.534
- Show your face.

31:58.751 --> 31:59.816
I know you're there.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.018
- Cam.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.753
- Cam.
- Campbell.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.221
- Cam.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.989
- I don't understand why
Blackwood's doing this to us.

32:05.991 --> 32:06.990
- Coward.

32:06.992 --> 32:10.961
(suspenseful electronic music)

32:21.440 --> 32:24.007
- Why would he leave
us out here on our own?

32:24.009 --> 32:25.642
- Well maybe we're
not on our own.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.177
- Calm down, Pippa.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.745
Let's just find Cam and get
the hell out of these woods.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.714
- He might be trying
to get back to the van.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.949
We should probably
head back there.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.250
- No, no, I really
don't want to go

32:33.252 --> 32:34.484
back to that van, please.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.752
- We're not going
back to the van.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.054
- Oh, so you're just
in charge now, yeah?

32:37.056 --> 32:38.188
We're just going to
do whatever you say,

32:38.190 --> 32:39.423
is that how this works?

32:42.027 --> 32:43.627
(Cam breathing heavily)

32:43.629 --> 32:46.697
(creature growling)

32:51.904 --> 32:53.236
(Cam screaming)

32:53.238 --> 32:55.739
- If you want to go back to
the van, go back to the van.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.442
But last time I saw Cam he
was heading off that way.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.810
So that's where I'm going.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.919
- No, not when our
friend is missing.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.220
You saw what happened to Mike.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.656
- We need to
prioritize ourselves.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.958
- That's right,
look after yourself.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.826
Come on, Pip.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.562
- Your Cam's only fucked
off into the woods

33:18.564 --> 33:19.830
with a gaping head wound.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.632
- Precisely why we
need to go find him.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.935
You're so inconsiderate.

33:24.937 --> 33:27.671
- If we'd gone back to
the van like I said,

33:27.673 --> 33:28.772
we would have found him.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.007
- Well--

33:30.009 --> 33:30.874
- Why don't you piss off
back to the van then?

33:30.876 --> 33:32.109
- Fuck you.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.143
- Stop, just stop
it, both of you.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.012
Stop fighting.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.580
You're acting like children.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.715
You're wasting time.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.117
We need to find Campbell.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.853
- But what about the monster?

33:42.855 --> 33:43.787
- What monster?

33:44.890 --> 33:46.289
We've been out here all night

33:46.291 --> 33:48.792
and I haven't seen
no monster, have you?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.394
Blackwood's insane.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.396
And what difference does it
make if there is a monster?

33:52.398 --> 33:55.365
Either way, we need
to get out of here.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.666
- Let the others catch up.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.034
- Shouldn't we keep going?

34:36.842 --> 34:37.741
Nat.

34:51.457 --> 34:55.392
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

34:59.398 --> 35:00.764
I'm sorry for leaving you.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.968
- It's not what you
did to me though.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.269
It's what you did to Mum.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.840
And now you show up here
expecting everything

35:09.842 --> 35:11.541
to be the same as it was before.

35:13.178 --> 35:16.646
(slow suspenseful music)

35:19.618 --> 35:22.986
She asked for you every day.

35:27.092 --> 35:30.060
And every day I'd tell her
that you'd be there tomorrow.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.936
You made me lie to her, Teddy.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.842
And even I started
to believe it,

35:45.844 --> 35:46.776
that perhaps one day you
might actually show up.

35:46.778 --> 35:50.313
(creature growling softly)

35:53.952 --> 35:58.788
I didn't know where you were,
nobody knew where you were.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.226
You're not even listening.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.427
You don't even care.

36:07.733 --> 36:08.832
Just leave me alone.

36:08.834 --> 36:12.068
(slow dramatic music)

36:38.463 --> 36:41.698
Do you think it really
happened to Campbell?

36:41.700 --> 36:42.999
- I don't know.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.203
- Do you really think
there's something after us?

36:46.205 --> 36:47.504
- I don't know.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.606
I'm sorry.

36:51.376 --> 36:52.642
- For what?

36:52.644 --> 36:54.144
- Everything.

36:54.146 --> 36:56.713
Bringing you here was a mistake.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.082
- Yeah, it was a
fucking mistake.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.817
There's not even a fucking van.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.721
- Why don't you fuck
off on your own then?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.189
Run away like you always do.

37:07.292 --> 37:10.627
- You know what, mate,
you're a fucking prick.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.830
- Guys, Pippa's fallen behind.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.098
Guys.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.999
- Do something.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.072
- Stay the fuck away from me.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.074
(slow dramatic music)

37:24.076 --> 37:26.009
- For heaven's sake,
Pippa's missing.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.623
- There you are.

37:40.659 --> 37:41.958
- I just want to go home.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.562
My head's killing me and
I'm so fucking hungry.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.098
- I know, me too.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.467
- And I swear we're
walking in circles.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.935
And my feet.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.237
These stupid wedges, they
hurt so fucking much.

37:54.239 --> 37:58.341
- Look, Pip, I know they hurt.

37:58.343 --> 38:01.111
- Guys, I think I
found something.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.415
- We're not getting out of
these woods now that it's dark.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.249
We need to stay
here for the night.

38:06.251 --> 38:07.417
(slow music)

38:07.419 --> 38:08.351
- [Pippa] Really?

38:08.353 --> 38:09.586
I think we should keep walking.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.854
I don't want to be out
here another night.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.489
- None of us want this.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.992
Maybe we should
stay here tonight.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.294
We'll be safer.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.902
(Ethan sighs)

38:25.904 --> 38:28.038
- What?

38:28.040 --> 38:30.473
- You should stay out
here, stay and keep watch.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.243
We'll take it in turns.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.146
- I've been walking through the
woods all day just like you.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.747
I need to sleep.

38:37.749 --> 38:38.648
- Hm.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.286
- I'm not staying up.

38:56.635 --> 39:00.103
(slow suspenseful music)

39:21.860 --> 39:24.928
(suspenseful music)

39:29.067 --> 39:32.535
(Teddy gasps)

39:32.537 --> 39:33.436
- Sorry, Ted.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.072
Are you okay?

39:39.144 --> 39:40.043
- Yeah.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.680
- I'm going to go to sleep now.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.584
I think this was a sign.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.455
I think we're going to be okay.

39:53.759 --> 39:54.657
Goodnight.

39:58.730 --> 39:59.629
- Night.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.359
(vegetation rustling)

40:39.838 --> 40:42.539
(wood creaking)

41:29.287 --> 41:32.789
(slow suspenseful music)

41:57.849 --> 42:01.084
(vegetation rustling)

42:22.874 --> 42:25.575
(wood creaking)

43:15.994 --> 43:19.062
(creature growling)

43:29.574 --> 43:31.908
There's something in the woods.

43:31.910 --> 43:34.677
(dramatic music)

43:41.353 --> 43:44.053
(Nat screaming)

43:47.292 --> 43:50.159
(girls whimpering)

44:09.014 --> 44:12.015
- What the fuck is going on?

44:12.017 --> 44:14.117
Oh my God, oh my God.

44:14.119 --> 44:15.018
- Oh.

44:19.624 --> 44:23.526
No. (pants)

44:26.731 --> 44:28.231
- Oh, Nat, where is it?

44:28.233 --> 44:29.165
Where is it?

44:29.167 --> 44:30.400
- I thought I saw it behind me.

44:30.402 --> 44:32.702
We need to go, we
need to go now.

44:37.942 --> 44:40.810
- Guys. (screams)

44:40.812 --> 44:41.644
(bone cracking)

44:41.646 --> 44:44.514
(Frances wailing)

44:45.950 --> 44:48.985
(Frances screaming)

44:54.125 --> 44:55.525
- Ted.

44:55.527 --> 44:58.027
Wait.

44:58.029 --> 44:58.861
- What?

44:58.863 --> 44:59.696
- Where are the others?

44:59.698 --> 45:02.765
(Frances screaming)

45:14.446 --> 45:15.845
- Nat, you're going towards it.

45:15.847 --> 45:16.746
Nat!

45:22.821 --> 45:23.653
- Frances!

45:23.655 --> 45:26.556
(Frances wailing)

45:32.097 --> 45:35.598
(Frances screaming)

45:35.600 --> 45:38.434
(Frances sobbing)

45:38.436 --> 45:42.638
- [Frances] Help
me, help me. (wails)

45:42.640 --> 45:44.474
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

45:44.476 --> 45:45.475
You okay?

45:45.477 --> 45:47.310
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.244
Shit.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.045
Pippa, get to the other side.

45:49.047 --> 45:49.879
We've got to get her up.

45:49.881 --> 45:51.481
(slow dramatic music)

45:51.483 --> 45:52.749
Fuck.

45:52.751 --> 45:53.883
Pippa, get to the
other side now.

45:53.885 --> 45:54.717
We've got to get her up.

45:54.719 --> 45:57.687
(Frances screaming)

46:04.095 --> 46:06.996
(dramatic music)

46:23.815 --> 46:26.682
- Nat, Nat we're over here?

46:26.684 --> 46:27.583
- Okay.

46:32.724 --> 46:33.556
- [Nat] What's wrong?

46:33.558 --> 46:35.558
- Teddy, need your help.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.026
Got to get her up.
- It's okay.

46:37.028 --> 46:40.296
(Frances screaming)

46:40.298 --> 46:41.197
- Shut up!

46:44.235 --> 46:46.469
Fuck, Ethan, we need to
move faster than this.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.703
- Don't leave me!

46:47.705 --> 46:51.374
- We're not leaving you,
we're not leaving you.

46:51.376 --> 46:54.510
- Oh my God, it's
there, it's coming.

47:02.220 --> 47:05.254
(slow eerie music)

47:05.256 --> 47:06.422
It was right there.

47:06.424 --> 47:07.957
It was right behind us.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.094
(slow dramatic music)

47:12.096 --> 47:13.796
- Nat, Pippa, you two go ahead.

47:15.266 --> 47:16.732
- We're not leaving.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.301
- Pippa, take Nat and
get the fuck out of here.

47:18.303 --> 47:19.969
We'll catch up.

47:19.971 --> 47:20.870
Go.
- We can't.

47:20.872 --> 47:21.771
- Go, go!

47:24.275 --> 47:25.107
- Ethan, I think we should--

47:25.109 --> 47:25.942
- We're not going.

47:25.944 --> 47:26.776
- She said it was--

47:26.778 --> 47:27.610
- We're not going.

47:27.612 --> 47:28.544
- It's going to kill us,

47:28.546 --> 47:31.714
it's going to fucking kill us.

47:31.716 --> 47:33.883
- Teddy, we're not
leaving her here to die.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.284
- Ethan.

47:35.286 --> 47:36.686
- We're staying.

47:39.924 --> 47:40.823
Teddy.

47:42.493 --> 47:43.860
Teddy, what the fuck?

47:43.862 --> 47:45.361
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:46.631 --> 47:47.597
Okay, okay.

47:55.573 --> 47:58.374
(Ethan grunting)

48:04.782 --> 48:06.349
- Are we safe?

48:06.351 --> 48:07.650
- [Ethan] No, no.

48:07.652 --> 48:09.719
(creature growling)

48:09.721 --> 48:12.021
- (screams) Did you hear that?

48:12.023 --> 48:13.189
Are we dying?

48:16.895 --> 48:19.295
Be our light in the
darkness, O Lord,

48:19.297 --> 48:21.063
and in your great
mercy defend us

48:21.065 --> 48:23.232
from all perils and
dangers of the night.

48:23.234 --> 48:27.970
For the love of your only
son, our savior, Jesus Christ.

48:29.641 --> 48:31.707
- Frances, Frances!

48:31.709 --> 48:32.608
Frances.

48:51.996 --> 48:52.995
Frances!

48:52.997 --> 48:55.798
(dramatic music)

49:18.923 --> 49:19.822
- Ethan.

49:24.896 --> 49:26.195
Where are they?

49:27.732 --> 49:28.798
- Teddy ran.

49:29.968 --> 49:31.200
- And Frances?

49:35.340 --> 49:38.741
(slow melancholy music)

51:38.096 --> 51:38.994
Guys.

52:18.102 --> 52:21.637
- I really don't think
you should be doing that.

52:21.639 --> 52:24.707
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.575
Listen, you need to help us.

52:26.577 --> 52:27.877
- Please, we need you to.

52:27.879 --> 52:28.844
We're lost.

52:30.114 --> 52:34.650
- I'm going to turn around,
and when I turn back

52:35.987 --> 52:37.486
you're going to be gone.

52:40.024 --> 52:41.457
I'm not going to see you.

52:43.361 --> 52:47.630
I'm not going to
hear you. (sniffs)

52:47.632 --> 52:49.465
And I'm not going to smell you.

52:52.537 --> 52:55.738
(slow dramatic music)

52:57.341 --> 52:59.175
- We need your help.

52:59.177 --> 53:00.142
We've been kidnapped.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.610
We've been out here for days.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.616
- Please, there's
something after us.

53:16.093 --> 53:17.893
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

53:19.263 --> 53:23.332
You see, you and me, we've
got a bit of a problem now,

53:24.735 --> 53:26.368
'cause I've turned back round.

53:29.340 --> 53:31.907
You are still here.

53:31.909 --> 53:33.642
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

53:33.644 --> 53:35.444
Okay, okay, we'll go.

53:36.414 --> 53:39.014
We'll go away.

53:39.016 --> 53:40.249
We're leaving.

53:41.686 --> 53:43.419
- Wait, wait.
- What?

53:45.289 --> 53:48.757
(slow suspenseful music)

53:56.701 --> 53:58.601
- You need to help us.

54:26.897 --> 54:29.632
(tree creaking)

54:52.590 --> 54:54.256
Why did you decide to help us?

55:04.168 --> 55:05.734
- I decided to help you.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.950
- I think Frances was right.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.253
Wedges aren't appropriate
camping shoes at all.

55:25.356 --> 55:27.823
They're not really
good anything shoes.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.992
I don't even know
why I bought them.

55:29.994 --> 55:32.661
All they do is hurt my feet.

55:32.663 --> 55:36.065
- (sighs) You really
need to be quiet.

55:36.067 --> 55:36.965
- Sorry.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.335
I talk when I'm nervous.

55:43.607 --> 55:46.342
(wood creaking)

55:57.888 --> 56:00.089
- You need to leave.

56:00.091 --> 56:01.724
- No, we can't leave.

56:01.726 --> 56:03.459
There's a monster
after us, I told you.

56:03.461 --> 56:05.294
It's following us.

56:05.296 --> 56:06.261
We're not leaving.

56:06.263 --> 56:08.130
- You're wasting my time.

56:08.132 --> 56:10.165
- It killed our friends.

56:10.167 --> 56:13.302
- (sighs) I don't want you here.

56:13.304 --> 56:14.336
(slow dramatic music)

56:14.338 --> 56:16.004
This is my camp.

56:18.242 --> 56:19.608
I want you to leave.

56:20.644 --> 56:21.477
- No.

56:23.948 --> 56:25.914
- That's not your
decision to make.

56:28.152 --> 56:29.051
- It's coming.

56:34.125 --> 56:35.023
- Shoot.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.059
Shoot it.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.131
Shoot it.

56:42.133 --> 56:44.433
Shoot it now, you shoot it.

56:44.435 --> 56:45.501
Shoot it!

56:45.503 --> 56:46.335
- [Man] There's nothing there.

56:46.337 --> 56:47.269
- Fucking shoot it.

56:47.271 --> 56:49.505
- There's nothing to shoot.

56:53.310 --> 56:55.244
(dramatic music)

56:55.246 --> 56:58.113
(men grunting)

56:58.115 --> 56:59.381
I've had enough.

56:59.383 --> 57:02.084
- Please, please,
it's right there.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.585
You've got to trust me.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.553
It's right there.

57:04.555 --> 57:07.623
(creature growling)

57:14.532 --> 57:15.764
- Where is it?

57:20.037 --> 57:21.103
- It's gone.

57:36.086 --> 57:37.786
- Why couldn't you see it?

57:45.329 --> 57:46.595
(dramatic music)

57:46.597 --> 57:48.130
- Ethan!

57:48.132 --> 57:49.531
(Ethan screaming)

57:49.533 --> 57:52.601
(creature screaming)

57:52.603 --> 57:54.570
- Can't fucking see it.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.575
- Please shoot it!

57:59.577 --> 58:02.478
(Ethan screaming)

58:04.982 --> 58:05.881
Shoot it!

58:10.688 --> 58:11.587
Shoot it!

58:15.159 --> 58:17.659
(gun firing)

58:18.796 --> 58:20.629
(creature growling)

58:20.631 --> 58:23.131
(slow music)

58:28.973 --> 58:29.872
Watch out!

58:39.550 --> 58:42.050
(gun firing)

58:47.057 --> 58:48.257
- Run!

58:48.259 --> 58:51.260
(girls whimpering)

58:52.930 --> 58:56.431
(man coughing)

58:56.433 --> 58:57.266
- Come on, we need to go.

58:57.268 --> 58:59.067
- No, you need to go.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.136
Run.

59:01.138 --> 59:01.870
- Come on, come on, hurry up.

59:01.872 --> 59:02.804
- Turn my back.

59:05.943 --> 59:06.842
- Move!

59:09.813 --> 59:13.048
(slow dramatic music)

59:39.209 --> 59:40.108
Follow me.

59:49.019 --> 59:52.087
(creature growling)

1:00:20.651 --> 1:00:23.719
(creature growling)

1:00:51.548 --> 1:00:54.616
(creature growling)

1:01:00.624 --> 1:01:01.523
Hey!

1:01:04.461 --> 1:01:07.863
Nat, Pippa, run!

1:01:11.568 --> 1:01:12.367
- Pippa.

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:13.602
Pippa, wait.

1:01:13.604 --> 1:01:14.503
We need to go after him.

1:01:14.505 --> 1:01:15.437
- But he told us to run.

1:01:15.439 --> 1:01:16.271
Let's go.
- No.

1:01:16.273 --> 1:01:17.639
- If we go that way...

1:01:17.641 --> 1:01:19.041
Let's keep going, he told us to.

1:01:19.043 --> 1:01:20.409
- Pippa.

1:01:20.411 --> 1:01:22.878
- Come on, Nat, after
everything he's put you through.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:23.712
- He's my brother.

1:01:23.714 --> 1:01:24.713
- He abandoned you.

1:01:24.715 --> 1:01:25.614
He's a shitty brother.

1:01:25.616 --> 1:01:26.815
- That doesn't matter.

1:01:26.817 --> 1:01:28.350
- So you're going to
go get yourself killed.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:29.685
Just 'cause you're happy to
die doesn't mean that I am.

1:01:29.687 --> 1:01:30.585
- [Nat] I'm not.

1:01:34.324 --> 1:01:36.692
- Nat, I'm sorry.

1:01:43.067 --> 1:01:43.965
- Come with me.

1:01:44.735 --> 1:01:46.001
- Don't you get it, Nat?

1:01:46.837 --> 1:01:47.736
He's dead.

1:01:51.475 --> 1:01:54.209
(Teddy panting)

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:12.527
(wood creaking)

1:02:26.910 --> 1:02:30.545
(creature growling softly)

1:03:08.786 --> 1:03:11.119
(vegetation rustling)

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:13.855
(Teddy panting)

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:19.795
(Teddy grunting)

1:03:19.797 --> 1:03:22.831
(creature growling)

1:04:03.941 --> 1:04:07.008
(creature growling)

1:04:09.980 --> 1:04:12.480
(slow music)

1:04:53.490 --> 1:04:55.991
(sighs) Nat, we're
not going to find him.

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:57.659
(distant screaming)

1:04:57.661 --> 1:04:58.727
What's that?

1:05:02.299 --> 1:05:03.632
- I don't know.

1:05:20.350 --> 1:05:23.585
(slow dramatic music)

1:05:53.116 --> 1:05:54.349
Let's go down.

1:06:38.662 --> 1:06:42.464
- Natash, Natasha.

1:06:42.466 --> 1:06:43.698
- Frances?

1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:44.733
Frances, no.

1:06:54.911 --> 1:06:56.077
- Go.

1:06:56.079 --> 1:06:57.445
This is where it feeds.

1:06:58.448 --> 1:06:59.547
It eats you alive.

1:07:01.018 --> 1:07:02.617
You have to go.

1:07:02.619 --> 1:07:03.518
- What?

1:07:04.888 --> 1:07:06.621
- It eats you alive?

1:07:07.457 --> 1:07:08.857
That's what Blackwood said.

1:07:11.928 --> 1:07:14.629
It won't bother you if
it thinks you're dead.

1:07:14.631 --> 1:07:15.630
- What do you mean?

1:07:17.701 --> 1:07:20.001
- That's why Blackwood
covered himself in blood,

1:07:20.003 --> 1:07:21.202
to conceal himself.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.844
(Frances whimpering)

1:07:39.656 --> 1:07:41.156
So that's what we have to do.

1:07:43.860 --> 1:07:45.960
We have to make it
think that we're dead.

1:07:48.298 --> 1:07:49.631
We have to look dead.

1:07:50.901 --> 1:07:53.068
We have to smell dead.

1:07:53.070 --> 1:07:55.303
We have to act dead.

1:08:02.446 --> 1:08:03.344
I'm sorry.

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:05.480
- Fuck no.

1:08:07.284 --> 1:08:10.085
(dramatic music)

1:08:15.125 --> 1:08:17.859
(Pippa sobbing)

1:08:21.798 --> 1:08:22.697
Nat, stop.

1:08:40.517 --> 1:08:42.283
Nat, Cam's our friend.

1:08:42.285 --> 1:08:44.085
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen.

1:08:44.087 --> 1:08:45.086
I can't--

1:08:45.088 --> 1:08:46.421
- This is what we have to do.

1:08:48.892 --> 1:08:52.093
This is how we hide,
how we survive.

1:08:52.095 --> 1:08:53.061
Just do it.

1:08:53.063 --> 1:08:54.596
- No.

1:08:54.598 --> 1:08:56.731
Because, because you don't
even know if it will work.

1:08:56.733 --> 1:08:58.600
It might even attract it.

1:08:58.602 --> 1:09:01.169
- Why else would Blackwood
cover himself in blood?

1:09:02.205 --> 1:09:03.104
Just do it.

1:09:05.408 --> 1:09:07.008
- We can't.

1:09:07.010 --> 1:09:08.877
We don't have to, please, Nat.

1:09:08.879 --> 1:09:13.281
(slow eerie music)

1:09:13.283 --> 1:09:14.182
We need to go.

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:18.386
- Leave me, leave me.

1:09:22.692 --> 1:09:24.726
- We're going to come back.

1:09:24.728 --> 1:09:26.561
We're going to get
you out of here.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:51.920
(slow dramatic music)

1:09:51.922 --> 1:09:54.656
(dramatic music)

1:10:06.436 --> 1:10:07.936
What are you doing?

1:10:07.938 --> 1:10:09.003
- I can't do this anymore.

1:10:09.005 --> 1:10:09.837
I'm sorry.

1:10:09.839 --> 1:10:11.206
My feet, they won't run.

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:12.106
I'm done.

1:10:13.510 --> 1:10:14.809
- Pippa, you'll die.

1:10:14.811 --> 1:10:16.277
- Can we hide?

1:10:16.279 --> 1:10:17.478
Nat, please, it's
going to get me

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.882
and I can't run in
these anymore, please.

1:10:22.652 --> 1:10:23.551
- Come on.

1:10:30.093 --> 1:10:30.992
- Love you, Nat.

1:10:34.264 --> 1:10:35.797
- I love you, Pip.

1:10:35.799 --> 1:10:36.631
(creature growling softly)

1:10:36.633 --> 1:10:39.701
(suspenseful music)

1:11:02.859 --> 1:11:04.225
Close your eyes.

1:11:13.303 --> 1:11:16.971
(creature growling softly)

1:12:00.550 --> 1:12:01.449
- Is it gone?

1:12:01.451 --> 1:12:04.352
(Pippa screaming)

1:12:08.091 --> 1:12:11.159
(creature growling)

1:12:12.262 --> 1:12:15.430
(creature screaming)

1:12:30.747 --> 1:12:33.314
(Nat sobbing)

1:12:36.052 --> 1:12:38.986
(footsteps pounding)

1:12:38.988 --> 1:12:41.556
(creature screaming)

1:12:41.558 --> 1:12:45.293
(dramatic electronic music)

1:12:55.772 --> 1:12:58.506
(Nat screaming)

1:13:01.745 --> 1:13:05.380
(creature growling softly)

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:23.364
(creature growling softly)

1:13:46.723 --> 1:13:47.688
(dramatic music)

1:13:47.690 --> 1:13:50.725
(creature growling)

1:14:15.485 --> 1:14:18.319
(dramatic music)

1:14:44.047 --> 1:14:47.548
(slow suspenseful music)

1:15:12.208 --> 1:15:14.876
(Nat groaning)

1:15:29.259 --> 1:15:32.059
(Nat whimpering)

1:15:53.182 --> 1:15:55.983
(Nat whimpering)

1:16:26.749 --> 1:16:31.819
- No, no, Teddy no, no! (sobs)

1:16:32.755 --> 1:16:34.088
Teddy.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:34.989
Teddy, no.

1:16:35.892 --> 1:16:37.191
Please wake up.

1:16:39.462 --> 1:16:42.296
I can't do this
by myself, Teddy.

1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:46.767
(screams) Come on!

1:16:48.171 --> 1:16:49.503
I'm right here!

1:16:50.373 --> 1:16:55.443
Come and get me! (screams)

1:16:58.915 --> 1:16:59.814
Teddy.

1:17:02.285 --> 1:17:03.918
Please.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:05.186
(Teddy gasping)

1:17:05.188 --> 1:17:06.320
Oh my, Teddy.

1:17:07.557 --> 1:17:08.389
Teddy.

1:17:08.391 --> 1:17:09.624
- Nat.

1:17:09.626 --> 1:17:11.926
- Please don't die.

1:17:11.928 --> 1:17:13.728
Please don't leave me.

1:17:13.730 --> 1:17:16.130
I can't do this on my own.

1:17:16.132 --> 1:17:17.031
Please.

1:17:18.768 --> 1:17:23.371
- You're strong,
stronger than me.

1:17:23.373 --> 1:17:24.271
I'm sorry.

1:17:26.175 --> 1:17:27.208
I'm so sorry, Nat.

1:17:27.210 --> 1:17:28.142
I was scared and I was selfish

1:17:28.144 --> 1:17:29.710
and I'm not brave like you.

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:36.984
I shouldn't have
left you and Mum.

1:17:38.354 --> 1:17:39.820
- You came back.

1:17:39.822 --> 1:17:42.156
You saved me.

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:43.057
- Don't give up.

1:17:44.627 --> 1:17:46.327
You're the bravest
person I know.

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:48.529
(slow music)

1:17:48.531 --> 1:17:51.532
You stayed with Mum when
I got scared and ran.

1:17:55.071 --> 1:17:55.820
Thank you.

1:17:55.821 --> 1:17:56.570
You didn't give up
then, don't give up now.

1:17:56.572 --> 1:17:58.439
You've come this far, Nat.

1:17:58.441 --> 1:17:59.674
(Nat sobbing)

1:17:59.676 --> 1:18:02.376
You'll find a way, you
have to, for all of us.

1:18:04.781 --> 1:18:05.913
For Mum.

1:18:05.915 --> 1:18:08.883
- (sobs) Oh Teddy.

1:18:15.491 --> 1:18:16.390
- Nat.

1:18:17.493 --> 1:18:20.094
I need you to do
something for me.

1:18:20.096 --> 1:18:21.095
- Anything.

1:18:25.601 --> 1:18:28.369
- I don't want to be
alive when it comes back.

1:18:32.175 --> 1:18:33.207
- No.

1:18:33.209 --> 1:18:34.341
No, pretend you're dead.

1:18:34.343 --> 1:18:35.643
It'll leave you alone.

1:18:35.645 --> 1:18:38.412
- I won't need to pretend soon.

1:18:38.414 --> 1:18:39.280
- No.

1:18:40.116 --> 1:18:41.015
- For me.

1:18:42.118 --> 1:18:44.351
- Don't ask me to do this.

1:18:45.922 --> 1:18:47.154
- Please.

1:18:47.156 --> 1:18:49.657
- I don't want you to go.

1:18:49.659 --> 1:18:52.126
I don't want to be on my own.

1:18:54.030 --> 1:18:55.162
- I love you.

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:41.942
- I love you.

1:20:09.105 --> 1:20:11.939
(Nat whimpering)

1:20:38.734 --> 1:20:41.969
(slow dramatic music)

1:21:29.385 --> 1:21:31.852
(slow music)

1:23:23.399 --> 1:23:26.300
(car spluttering)

1:23:37.246 --> 1:23:40.147
(car spluttering)

1:23:59.268 --> 1:24:02.669
(slow melancholy music)

1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:06.707
(Nat sobbing)

1:24:35.404 --> 1:24:38.305
(car spluttering)

1:25:00.429 --> 1:25:03.664
(slow dramatic music)

1:26:32.321 --> 1:26:37.291
(door creaking)
(Nat gasping)

1:26:39.361 --> 1:26:42.529
(footsteps creaking)

1:27:09.024 --> 1:27:11.525
(slow music)

1:28:02.011 --> 1:28:04.578
(Nat gasping)

1:28:06.482 --> 1:28:09.049
(Nat gagging)

1:28:47.489 --> 1:28:48.822
- Good evening, Natasha.

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:51.124
I have to say you're
looking great.

1:28:51.126 --> 1:28:52.626
- [Nat] Fuck you.

1:28:52.628 --> 1:28:54.728
- I was simply doing
what had to be done.

1:28:55.698 --> 1:28:57.631
- You fed us to that thing.

1:28:58.967 --> 1:29:01.968
- I want you to try to put
yourself in my shoes, Natasha.

1:29:01.970 --> 1:29:05.205
I want you to gain a
little perspective.

1:29:05.207 --> 1:29:07.274
I was in a plane crash.

1:29:07.276 --> 1:29:10.711
We survivors were lost
in a frozen wasteland.

1:29:10.713 --> 1:29:11.878
We were starving.

1:29:14.416 --> 1:29:15.716
We were desperate.

1:29:15.718 --> 1:29:16.983
We ate the pilot.

1:29:16.985 --> 1:29:18.251
- Cannibal.

1:29:18.253 --> 1:29:20.087
- What I did was an
effort to survival.

1:29:20.089 --> 1:29:22.255
Our cannibalism
summoned this monster,

1:29:23.225 --> 1:29:25.392
and it's followed me ever since.

1:29:25.394 --> 1:29:26.626
And now it's after you.

1:29:27.663 --> 1:29:29.696
But you're just like me.

1:29:29.698 --> 1:29:31.832
You're a survivor.

1:29:31.834 --> 1:29:32.766
Leave now.

1:29:33.736 --> 1:29:35.168
Do what I do.

1:29:35.170 --> 1:29:37.537
Feed people human flesh.

1:29:37.539 --> 1:29:39.272
Stop it coming after you.

1:29:40.376 --> 1:29:41.208
(Blackwood grunting)

1:29:41.210 --> 1:29:42.142
(dramatic music)

1:29:42.144 --> 1:29:42.876
- [Nat] I'm not like you.

1:29:44.179 --> 1:29:45.812
- You stupid bitch.

1:29:46.615 --> 1:29:49.349
(Nat screaming)

1:29:51.754 --> 1:29:54.988
(Blackwood screaming)
