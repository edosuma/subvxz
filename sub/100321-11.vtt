WEBVTT

00:00.501 --> 00:01.633
- (Giggles)

00:01.635 --> 00:03.035
- Okay, Stevie, I told you
I didn't want

00:03.037 --> 00:04.636
a jokey bachelor party.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.838
Also, my t-shirt is missing
the "with".

00:06.840 --> 00:08.706
- Oh, no, I had yours
custom-made.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.109
- Okay.
- Now,

00:10.111 --> 00:12.444
<i> before I tell you what</i>
<i> I have planned...</i>

00:12.446 --> 00:14.379
for tonight's festivities,

00:14.381 --> 00:16.648
I think we can all agree
that putting me in charge

00:16.650 --> 00:19.318
of your joint bachelor party
was a big mistake, right?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.286
- I'm sure it's gonna be great.
- Absolutely.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.588
- And the fact that you guys
wanted it to be

00:23.590 --> 00:24.923
the "bachelor party
of your dreams"

00:24.925 --> 00:27.793
only added extra,
totally unnecessary pressure

00:27.795 --> 00:29.160
to the whole thing.
- 'Kay, Stevie,

00:29.162 --> 00:31.262
we never said that.
- Oh no, you didn't.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.532
David sent me a seven-page
e-mail with the subject line,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.733
"The Bachelor Party
of My Dreams".

00:35.735 --> 00:37.736
- We will be happy with
whatever you've planned.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.005
Right, David?
- Yes.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.340
Just depends on
what she's planned.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.943
- (Slurps)
- Oh.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.278
(Intrigued) Oh...

00:46.280 --> 00:49.648
- David, you wanted something
chic and elegant.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.484
I have arranged for a night
of customized appetizers

00:52.486 --> 00:54.953
and cocktails
at the Wobbly Elm.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.588
- Wow, that's bleak. (Laughs)

00:58.291 --> 01:00.959
But thank you...
for planning that.

01:00.961 --> 01:01.960
- (Whispers) There we go.
- Mm.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.562
- Patrick...
- Yeah.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.130
- You just wanted one thing.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.366
- So before we indulge in
an elegant night of shots,

01:08.368 --> 01:11.036
we will all experience
the thrill

01:12.239 --> 01:15.274
of Elmdale's finest and only...

01:15.276 --> 01:16.508
Escape Room.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.976
- Yes!
- Okay,

01:17.978 --> 01:19.845
isn't that a Jodie Foster movie?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.580
<i> - No, David, that is</i>
<i> Panic Room.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:23.815
An escape room is like a,
a fun group game

01:23.817 --> 01:25.184
where you're trapped in a room

01:25.186 --> 01:27.319
and you have to solve
all these puzzles to get out.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.487
- (Laughs) You lost me
at fun group game.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.090
I'm sorry, my family agreed
to this?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.058
- Your family hasn't responded
to a single email,

01:34.060 --> 01:35.928
so they will be doing
what we tell them to do.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.796
- Is there anything else
on my list

01:37.798 --> 01:39.264
that we could do this evening?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.966
- If you could come up with
the money

01:40.968 --> 01:42.667
for the Tahitian dolphin
cruise,

01:42.669 --> 01:45.537
I'd happily change plans. No?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.339
- Don't say a word.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.544
♪♪♪

01:53.647 --> 01:57.282
- So I leaned in and I said,
"Tippy, I'll take the job...

01:57.284 --> 01:59.485
for a hundred grand more
than Clifton,

01:59.487 --> 02:01.753
and a diamond tennis bracelet."

02:01.755 --> 02:03.188
- What was the bracelet for?

02:03.190 --> 02:05.557
- Dramatic effect. Symbolism.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.227
- And you said Nicole Kidman
is starring in it?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.161
- Oh, it doesn't matter
who's starring!

02:10.163 --> 02:12.096
I don't think the point
is getting across.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.432
- No, no, I get it.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.700
It's just that a lot of people
would have a really hard time

02:15.702 --> 02:17.236
saying no to that kind of work,

02:17.238 --> 02:18.970
especially when you spent
the last three years

02:18.972 --> 02:20.038
talking about how badly

02:20.040 --> 02:22.040
you wanted to get outta
this place.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.942
- Oh, we're still on course.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.644
Oh, you know what they say,

02:25.646 --> 02:28.680
when one door closes,
the floodgates open.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.148
- You got another job?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.684
- Say hello, ladies,
to the new spokesperson

02:32.686 --> 02:35.354
of an international airline.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.322
- Oh my gosh, Mrs. Rose!

02:37.324 --> 02:39.724
You're gonna be in a commercial
for an airline?!

02:39.726 --> 02:41.193
- Radio, yes.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.695
Voiceover work
is every actor's dream.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.665
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- Thank you!

02:46.667 --> 02:48.533
- I have to admit, Mrs. Rose,

02:48.535 --> 02:50.469
these past few weeks,

02:50.471 --> 02:52.871
I feel like I've been waiting
on a famous person.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.606
- (Laughs) Twyla,

02:54.608 --> 02:57.209
you're not waiting on
a famous person.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.944
She's already arrived!

02:58.946 --> 03:00.012
- (Laughs)

03:01.115 --> 03:02.381
<i> (Blue Jay cries, dog barks)</i>

03:02.383 --> 03:03.982
(Door opens)

03:03.984 --> 03:06.084
- 'Kay, what's going on?
- Hey, guys, come on in!

03:06.086 --> 03:07.219
Close the door.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.820
- Johnny, this better be good.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.289
I got a hot little BLT
over at the café

03:11.291 --> 03:12.824
and I don't wanna keep her
waitin'.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.893
- I got some big news.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.563
I've been, uh, reaching out
to some old business contacts

03:18.565 --> 03:21.332
about potentially investing
in a motel franchise,

03:21.334 --> 03:23.901
and I got a very positive
response today

03:23.903 --> 03:26.772
from Mike Morrison,
my former assistant,

03:26.774 --> 03:29.508
who's now a big venture
capitalist.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.776
- Ooh, wow!
- Okay, so what does this mean?

03:31.778 --> 03:33.378
More, more money?

03:33.380 --> 03:35.080
- Possibly.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.051
- I'm listening.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.286
- Well, I don't wanna put
the cart before the horse here,

03:41.288 --> 03:44.456
but I have a feeling
this is a prospect

03:44.458 --> 03:47.659
we can all get very excited
about! (Laughs)

03:47.661 --> 03:49.394
- But what does this mean?
Do they wanna invest?

03:49.396 --> 03:50.795
Do they like the idea?

03:50.797 --> 03:52.330
- Well, they haven't heard
the idea yet.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.733
I gave him a teaser
in my last e-mail.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.868
And, uh, we'll have to take
a meeting with him

03:56.870 --> 03:59.638
and, you know,
do a formal pitch.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.072
- Sure. Well,
when's the meeting?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.375
- We don't actually have
a meeting yet,

04:03.377 --> 04:06.411
but he is calling today, so...

04:06.413 --> 04:08.013
- Johnny, I'm sorry,
I was so busy

04:08.015 --> 04:09.881
being excited like you asked,

04:09.883 --> 04:12.150
that, um, I think I missed
something here.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.819
Do we have an investor
or do we have a meeting?

04:14.821 --> 04:16.254
- We might.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.890
And I want you to keep this
information to yourself.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.527
I don't want the family finding
out and getting their hopes up.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.629
- I'm pretty sure I can keep
this one to myself.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.631
- Okay. Yeah,
I don't know about me.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.234
I mean, if the local papers
ask me about the rumour

04:29.236 --> 04:31.069
that you might be getting
a phone call...

04:31.071 --> 04:32.470
- All right, all right,
you know what, Roland?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.873
You can go and finish
your sandwich now.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.475
- Thank you.
And by the way, Johnny,

04:36.477 --> 04:38.243
you should check to make sure
this place isn't bugged.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.578
We wouldn't want the big news
to leak out!

04:40.580 --> 04:43.382
- It is big news...
(Door closes)

04:43.384 --> 04:44.783
probably.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.286
(Key rattles in door)

04:49.122 --> 04:50.489
(Door shuts)
- Hi.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.124
What, uh, um...

04:52.126 --> 04:54.126
are those... sweatpants?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.993
- Yeah, I started getting
dressed for work

04:55.995 --> 04:57.662
and I got distracted.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.197
- What could have possibly
distracted you enough

04:59.199 --> 05:02.000
to do that to yourself?
- (Emotional) It died, David.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.735
- Okay, if you're talking
about your style,

05:03.737 --> 05:05.336
we can bring it back to life.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.872
- Ted gave this to me.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.874
It's like the one thing left
of our relationship

05:08.876 --> 05:10.408
and it's gone.
- 'Kay,

05:10.410 --> 05:12.910
I would argue that you still
have your memories.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.079
- This weird little desert
daisy thing--

05:15.081 --> 05:16.448
- It's a succulent.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.316
- Literally not supposed
to die, and yet it did.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.719
Like what does that say
about me?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.620
- I think that's a longer
conversation.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.623
But here's one thing
that'll make you feel good:

05:25.625 --> 05:27.625
my bachelor party tonight.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.861
- I'm pretty sure I told Stevie
that I couldn't come,

05:29.863 --> 05:32.497
or like I started sending her
an email saying that.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.099
I don't know, I just...

05:34.101 --> 05:36.367
I can't seem to do anything
right now.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.836
- Mm-hmm. I never thought
I'd have to say this,

05:38.838 --> 05:40.172
but there is only space
in this family

05:40.174 --> 05:41.740
for one unstable sibling,

05:41.742 --> 05:44.576
and I have held that title
for a very long time,

05:44.578 --> 05:46.844
so you are going to have
to get it together.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.947
- David, I don't have
a boyfriend anymore.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.582
I'm like trying get my business
off the ground,

05:50.584 --> 05:52.316
but honestly, like how many
people in this town

05:52.318 --> 05:55.053
need a publicist?
Like, what am I doing?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.523
- Well, as of 7:30 tonight,

05:58.525 --> 06:01.592
you will be thoroughly enjoying
yourself at my bachelor party.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.928
So, why don't you take a couple
of Mom's happy pills

06:03.930 --> 06:06.131
and we can just put this
whole situation on ice

06:06.133 --> 06:07.899
until tomorrow?
- No, I can't.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.534
I have to escort a client
to a meeting.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.836
Moira: Alexis!
- Ugh!

06:11.838 --> 06:13.805
- Are you almost ready, dear?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.540
The airline will not be
impressed

06:15.542 --> 06:18.576
if we don't have an on-schedule
arrival at the studio.

06:18.578 --> 06:22.280
Oh, David, is it all right
if I don't watch Panic Room

06:22.282 --> 06:24.015
with everyone tonight?

06:24.017 --> 06:26.384
Jo Foster once screened it
for me privately

06:26.386 --> 06:28.886
and I would like to keep that
memory safe.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.190
- It's an escape room followed
by a really sad reception,

06:32.192 --> 06:34.292
and everyone will be
participating.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.328
Thank you so much!

06:37.364 --> 06:39.431
Johnny: Stevie?
- Yeah?

06:39.433 --> 06:42.467
I got this picture of David
back from the printer.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.903
I hope it's big enough.
- Oh my God, this is perfect!

06:44.905 --> 06:48.239
- Are you sure we can't move
the bachelor party

06:48.241 --> 06:50.708
to the motel here?
We can bring out some games,

06:50.710 --> 06:53.178
and, you know, escape from...
one room to the other.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.581
This is just a bad time
to be away from the business.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.983
- Ah... bachelor party, right?

06:58.985 --> 07:00.585
- Yeah, it's just for family.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.855
- Well, I think godfather
is part of the family,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.123
is he not?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.925
- Roland, I need you manning
the phones.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.061
- (Sighs) Take it easy,
Johnny, okay?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.197
Not that it's gonna happen,
but I'll come running

07:12.199 --> 07:14.099
when Ike Morrison calls.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.067
- You mean Mike Morrison.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.136
- You're waiting on a call
from him, too?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.938
- That's the only call
I'm expecting.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.541
- No, you said you were waiting
on a call from "Ike" Morrison.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.276
- I don't know an Ike Morrison.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.679
Mike Morrison was my assistant
for 3 years,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.347
I think I know what
his name is.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.016
- Well, that's what I thought!

07:31.018 --> 07:33.118
So I was confused when
a Mike Morrison called

07:33.120 --> 07:35.653
after you said Ike Morrison--
- Mike Morrison called?!

07:35.655 --> 07:37.789
- Yeah.
- Well, give me the number!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.891
- You know, maybe this is why

07:39.893 --> 07:42.160
Roland shouldn't be in charge
of phones.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.794
- Hey!

07:43.796 --> 07:46.364
- Hello? Oh, voicemail.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.767
Uh, Mike, Mike.
Hi, it's Johnny Rose calling.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.234
Sorry I didn't get your
message.

07:50.236 --> 07:53.505
Uh, a few technical
difficulties on our end,

07:53.507 --> 07:56.107
but, uh, it's Johnny Rose
calling.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.109
Uh, Johnny Rose calling
you back.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.911
Uh, bye.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.312
(Phone beeps off)

08:01.314 --> 08:04.082
Oh, I don't know.
H-how did that sound?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.250
- Is there an option
to redo it?

08:06.252 --> 08:08.319
- Uh... no.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.522
- Yeah, it was fine.
- Okay.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.457
- I don't think you mentioned
your name.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.694

08:17.030 --> 08:18.663

08:18.665 --> 08:20.398
We'd like for you to read it
exactly as written.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.100
- Oh wow, a prolific amount
of material.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.537
And I am being paid
for each spot, so hah!

08:25.539 --> 08:28.273
- Oh, uh, we agreed to a flat
rate with your publicist.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.944
- Well, there'll be nothing
flat about my performance.

08:32.946 --> 08:36.281
- (Chuckles) Okay.
Whenever you're ready, Moira.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.784
Just start at the top, and...
high energy.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.419
- Con brio, si!

08:41.421 --> 08:43.021
(Clears throat)

08:43.023 --> 08:45.823
"We really care...
at Larry Air."

08:45.825 --> 08:47.558
I like that, it's snappy.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.493
"We really care--
- Just roll right through.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.697
Just go on to the next line,
please.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.634
"A deal so rare,
it's Larry Air."

08:57.236 --> 09:00.371
"Never flown Larry Air?
Try Larry Air."

09:00.373 --> 09:03.441
Oh, that's a touch uninspired.
Alexis?

09:03.443 --> 09:06.444
(Whispers) Alexis!
I'd rather not use that one.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.747
- Okay, so I'm being told just
to read through them all

09:08.749 --> 09:11.282
and then we'll figure it out
after, okay?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.585
And higher energy.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.853
- Higher... (Clears throat)

09:14.855 --> 09:17.722
(Higher pitched) "Get your
derriere on Larry Air--"

09:17.724 --> 09:20.291
That's a bit chummy
for an airline.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.994
Couldn't we maybe take a moment
to rework some of these?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.562
- The client's not here.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.331
It's my job just to get you
to say the words.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.333
- (Sighs)

09:28.335 --> 09:30.201
(Deeper voice) "Larry Air.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.337
We'll take you from there...
to here--"

09:32.339 --> 09:34.806
Now that should switched,
shouldn't it? You should--

09:34.808 --> 09:37.475
Alexis, I can't work like this!

09:37.477 --> 09:39.276
<i> No.</i>

09:39.278 --> 09:42.013
- (Frustrated sigh)
- Alexis!

09:42.015 --> 09:44.215
- I'm so sorry. This is like
the first offer I could get

09:44.217 --> 09:46.751
after that whole "Sunrise Bay"
thing went down, and I...

09:46.753 --> 09:48.086
I thought it would get you
back out there,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.488
but I did not know that
it would be this.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.158
- Have I made a terrible
mistake, Alexis?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.093
Is this the lowest point
of my life?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.061
- Okay, look who
you're talking to.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.097
I haven't showered in like
two days.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.032
Is this the lowest point
of my life?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.434
- Thought you should know
that we can hear

10:03.436 --> 10:05.636
your entire conversation.
- Ooh... okay.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.238
You should not have to do this,

10:07.240 --> 10:09.974
so you start the car
and I will cover for you.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.876
- Oh, Alexis, no.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.311
No, dear,

10:13.313 --> 10:15.780
I could not let you do that
for me.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.650
- (Protracted throat clear)

10:19.719 --> 10:22.253
- Just hit "record".

10:22.255 --> 10:25.256
- (Imitating Moira) "Try one
of our in-flight meals,

10:25.258 --> 10:28.059
if you dare... at Larry Air."

10:30.430 --> 10:33.398
I'm sorry, this is not...
this is not good, so.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.668
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

10:41.708 --> 10:43.341
<i> (Cars whoosh by)</i>

10:47.347 --> 10:51.616
- Okay, well, um, I would just
like to welcome everybody

10:51.618 --> 10:54.218
to our... bachelor party.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.654
- Is anyone else not getting
a signal in here?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.090
- I thought there were drinks.
- That's after.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.960
- Okay, how about half of us
do the escape room,

11:01.962 --> 11:03.961
and then the other half of us
get a table at the bar?

11:03.963 --> 11:05.897
- Okay, how 'bout you shh
for a sec.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.765
Now, this will all go a lot
smoother

11:07.767 --> 11:09.234
if we just accept the fact

11:09.236 --> 11:11.669
that this is something we
have to do, and that Patrick,

11:11.671 --> 11:13.705
for some reason, thinks this
is gonna be-- (Door opens) fun!

11:13.707 --> 11:15.540
- Fun!
- Here he is.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.475
- Hi, hi, hi. Sorry, it took me
forever to find a spot.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.644
- That's okay!
- Who's excited, huh?!

11:19.646 --> 11:21.512
- Oh, hah-hah.
- Oh... huzzah.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.281
- So I guess you're all
wondering uh...

11:23.283 --> 11:25.116
what're we doing here? (Laughs)
All: (Mumbling) Hmm...

11:25.118 --> 11:27.085
- But, uh, the annual escape
room challenge

11:27.087 --> 11:29.587
has been a Brewer family
tradition for a long time,

11:29.589 --> 11:32.123
and I thought it could be fun
to share it with my new family,

11:32.125 --> 11:34.192
since mine couldn't be here,
so.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.093
- (Whispers) Have they passed?

11:36.095 --> 11:38.129
- Well, I'm sure I speak for
all of us when I say

11:38.131 --> 11:41.265
I hope we escape very quickly.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.334
- (Snaps finger) That's
the spirit, Mr. Rose. Yes.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.637
<i> Game voice: Players, are you</i>
<i> ready to enter the laboratory?</i>

11:45.639 --> 11:47.338
- (Whispers) Oh, I think so.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.274
<i> Game voice: Place all</i>
<i> electronic devices</i>

11:49.276 --> 11:51.342
<i> inside the scientist's lockbox</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:54.678
<i> and enter at your own risk.</i>

11:54.680 --> 11:57.148
- Okay, here we go. (Laughs)
- (Faux excitement) Oh my God.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.683
<i> David: It's gonna be fun.</i>

12:02.823 --> 12:04.756
<i> Game voice: Charles Darwin</i>
<i> is being held captive</i>

12:04.758 --> 12:06.224
<i> by his arch-nemesis,</i>

<i> rival scientist,</i>
<i> Dr. Alfred R. Wallace,</i>

12:08.962 --> 12:10.561
<i> somewhere in the Galapagos</i>
<i> Islands.</i>

12:10.563 --> 12:12.096
- What?!
(Door bangs shut)

12:12.098 --> 12:14.065
<i> Game voice: You have one hour</i>
<i> to escape. It's your job to--</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:16.167
- This is a Galapagos-themed
room!

12:16.169 --> 12:17.968
- I didn't plan this part.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.904
- It was just called
"The Laboratory."

12:19.906 --> 12:21.572
And I picked it
'cause it was the easiest.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.641
<i> Game voice: There are rumours</i>
<i> that Wallace's assistant</i>

12:23.643 --> 12:26.110
<i> sides with Darwin</i>
<i> and may be willing to help</i>

12:26.112 --> 12:28.313
if you get stuck.
- There's our lucky break.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.883
Assistant, show us the exit.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.918
Don't worry,
I'm also in the Guild.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.054
- That's uh, that's not exactly
how it works, Mrs. Rose.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.223
We do actually have
to try first.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.627
Okay. So, the numbers for the
combination on Darwin's journal

12:42.629 --> 12:44.929
are gonna be on finches
with red beaks.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.864
(Reads) "Traveling east
to west,

12:46.866 --> 12:49.333
the numbers on the beaks
will get you to the nest."

12:49.335 --> 12:51.202
- I have a compass on my phone.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.338
Uh, when do we get our phones
back?

12:54.340 --> 12:56.207
- Well, you don't actually need
a compass, Mr. Rose.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.810
It's, uh, more like
a brain teaser.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.546
So, uh, we'll cover more ground
if we pair off into teams.

13:01.548 --> 13:05.216
So Stevie and Mr. Rose,
uh, Alexis and, and David,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.952
and, uh, Mrs. Rose,
why don't you help me out?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.421
- Oh, I'd love nothing more,
Patrick.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.223
- Mrs. Rose, I'm sensing you
that you might be

13:12.225 --> 13:13.691
a little bit distracted,

13:13.693 --> 13:15.226
but unfortunately,
there is a time limit

13:15.228 --> 13:17.361
on us getting out of here.
- (Chuckles)

13:17.363 --> 13:20.564
Oh, I used to share your
philosophic optimism, dear,

13:20.566 --> 13:22.300
but know the reality is,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.368
we're never getting out
of here.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.037
- I wouldn't be so sure.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.106
Just found a finch.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.442
The first number is six,
people!

13:31.444 --> 13:34.112
- Okay. Okay, see this is why
I don't like mind games.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.848
It puts you in a situation
where you're made to feel dumb,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.182
even though you're not.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.784
Like, some people's minds
just don't work like this.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.253
- Maybe I made a mistake?

13:42.255 --> 13:44.255
- I did tell you to wear
sensible heels today,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.457
and I'm not sure this outfit
is entirely appropriate.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.326
- No, I mean about not going
to the Galapagos.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.362
Like I'm having a hard time
not taking this as a sign.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.664
- Okay, we're in a strip mall
on the side of the highway.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.199
I really wouldn't read
into this.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.803
Also, as stupid as this is,
I'm now invested.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.905
- You know, there was a time,
before we got here,

14:00.907 --> 14:03.941
that I would've like gone
anywhere and done anything,

14:03.943 --> 14:05.776
no questions asked.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.212
Like, what if I'm just losing
my edge?

14:08.214 --> 14:10.882
- All right, if this'll help me
escape this conversation:

14:10.884 --> 14:13.951
yes, it would have been
a mistake to go.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.153
- Okay, go on.
- Well, what were you gonna do?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.022
Follow another guy around
the world?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.624
- Yeah, but what am I doing
here?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.693
Setting Mom up with second-rate
radio gigs

14:21.695 --> 14:23.160
for regional airlines?

14:23.162 --> 14:26.497
- 'Kay, well, I don't know,
where do you wanna be then?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.098
- There.
- (Confused) Where?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.702
- No, the finch.
Second row, in the middle.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.203
Trust me, Stavros and I used
to make out

14:32.205 --> 14:33.938
in his parents' aviary.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.606
- Okay, we have the second
number!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.642
The second number is eight!

14:39.378 --> 14:41.846
- 'Kay, I'm gonna start looking
from the top here.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.047
- Excuse me, Assistant?

14:43.049 --> 14:45.049
Uh, any chance of getting
our phones back?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.785
I know, I'm aware of
the no-phones situation,

14:47.787 --> 14:50.120
but I need mine
for a business--

14:50.122 --> 14:51.789
See, I don't know
what this means.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.658
I heard a rumour you're on
our side,

14:53.660 --> 14:55.793
and I'm, I'm waiting on
an important call.

14:55.795 --> 14:56.861
<i> Patrick: I found it!</i>

14:56.863 --> 14:58.529
I found it!
I found the third finch.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.865
- Okay. Okay!
- It's four, David. Four.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.467
6-8-4.
- Okay!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.136
Six...

15:05.138 --> 15:07.004
eight...

15:07.006 --> 15:08.472
<i> four...</i>

15:08.474 --> 15:10.274
(Overly excited)
Ah-hah-hah!

15:10.276 --> 15:11.809
Ahh! Ahhh!

15:11.811 --> 15:13.845
- Woo!
- Yes!

15:13.847 --> 15:16.814
- 'Kay. It says "natural
selection."

15:16.816 --> 15:18.549
(Drawer slides)
- Ahh!
- Oh my God!

15:18.551 --> 15:21.152
- Well, good work, team!
Now who's driving me to drinks?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.554
- Outta my way! Outta my way!

15:23.556 --> 15:25.089
(Searching frantically)

15:25.091 --> 15:27.091
- Okay, there's no key in here.
There is no key in here.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.626
- That's just the first puzzle,
David.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.760
It's a series of puzzles.
(Distant ringing)

15:29.762 --> 15:32.096
- What?!
- Wait, wait, everyone!

15:32.098 --> 15:33.964
<i> I hear my phone ringing.</i>

15:33.966 --> 15:35.566
That's the phone
I was talking about.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.036
So if I could just leave
the lab for one minute--

15:38.038 --> 15:40.371
<i>Game voice: You have 52 minutes</i>
<i> to escape.</i>

15:40.373 --> 15:41.739
- 52 minutes!

15:41.741 --> 15:43.774
- Hey, David, everyone heard
the time, all right?

15:43.776 --> 15:46.711
(Shouting) 52, people!
Let's go! Come on!

15:46.713 --> 15:48.079
(Crickets chirping)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.381
- Blow on them, David! You have
to blow on the circles, David!

15:50.383 --> 15:52.383
You have to blow on the circles
until they're blue.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.285
- I'm blowing!
- Blow harder, David!

15:54.287 --> 15:56.587
- Oh my God, you blow on them!
You blow on the circles then!

15:56.589 --> 15:59.257
- Use this! Use this thing!
- (Catching his breath)

15:59.259 --> 16:01.658
- 'Kay, this is a good idea.
- 'Kay. Oh!

16:01.660 --> 16:02.860
- Oh my God!
- (Clapping) Yes!

16:02.862 --> 16:05.629
- Oh my God!
Alexis: Yes! Ahhh! Yes!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.132
- One more! One more!
- (Grunting hard)

16:08.134 --> 16:09.567
All: (Cheering)
- Yay!

16:09.569 --> 16:11.002
- It didn't do anything.
(Drawer slides)

16:11.004 --> 16:13.737
Oh! Oh! It's uh...

16:13.739 --> 16:15.673
- What is that?
- It's a flashlight?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.808
- Oh yeah! Oh my God,
this game is actually fun.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.444
- See? I told you!

16:19.446 --> 16:21.045
- You're only saying that
because you got one right!

16:21.047 --> 16:22.847
- Oh, your time will come,
David.

16:22.849 --> 16:26.083
- Please just give us the key.
- The key, or our phones!

16:26.085 --> 16:27.785
Either way!
- No, the key!

16:27.787 --> 16:30.287
John, what is this newfound
obsession with your device?

16:30.289 --> 16:33.223
- Dad, what's the big deal
with the phone?

16:33.225 --> 16:35.292
- Just tell them, Mr. Rose.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.095
- Okay. Well, I didn't want
to get ahead of myself,

16:38.097 --> 16:41.566
but I'm waiting on a call
from my old assistant.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.368
And we may have a meeting
to get an investor

16:44.370 --> 16:46.670
for the Rosebud Motel Group.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.906
- Well, John, what,
what does this mean?

16:48.908 --> 16:52.576
- Well, potentially, there
could be a big influx of money

16:52.578 --> 16:54.979
to turn Rosebud Motels into a...

16:54.981 --> 16:57.448
into a full franchise.
- Oh!

16:57.450 --> 16:59.950
- Well, why didn't you say
this before? Get the phone!

16:59.952 --> 17:02.253
- Oh, I don't know. we're
almost finished the game, so.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.989
- You can use my phone, John!
- You still have your phone?!

17:04.991 --> 17:07.525
- We all have our phones!

17:07.527 --> 17:09.726
- Well, his number's in
my phone

17:09.728 --> 17:11.728
and my phone I can't get

17:11.730 --> 17:13.798
unless I get outta this
damn room!

17:13.800 --> 17:15.733
<i> Alexis: Okay, I've used</i>
<i> the clues</i>

17:15.735 --> 17:17.402
to turn the dials
on the flashlight,

17:17.404 --> 17:19.336
and it spells out England.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.305
So, thank you, my weekend
with Tom Hardy...

17:21.307 --> 17:23.808
England is here.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.276
- It says something.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.446
- "I'm tall when I'm young
and short when I'm old."

17:29.949 --> 17:31.282
Candle.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.617
- How are you doing this?

17:33.619 --> 17:35.086
- (Gasps) What?

17:35.088 --> 17:38.823
- Laser. Laser's pointing at--
- Okay, I got this, Patrick.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.826
Okay, this is an ancient
Egyptian symbol for stability.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.828
My friend Prairie got one
tattooed on her lower-back

17:43.830 --> 17:45.129
in seventh grade.
- Okay,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.897
what does that mean?!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.766
- It means that we need to find
something from Egypt.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.302
So like mummies, Rami Malek,
a...

17:52.372 --> 17:54.638
a pyramid.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.240
All: (Gasp)
David: What?!

17:56.242 --> 17:59.310
- And there it is.
- (Gasps) Try it in the door!

18:01.214 --> 18:02.713
(Key rattles, door clicks open)

18:02.715 --> 18:03.981
<i> Game voice: Congratulations!</i>

18:03.983 --> 18:06.117
<i> You have outwitted Darwin's</i>
<i> nemesis...</i>

18:06.119 --> 18:08.953
- Ah! Mummy and Alexis
solved the puzzle!

18:08.955 --> 18:10.521
<i> Johnny: (Relieved sigh)</i>

18:10.523 --> 18:12.223
- How did she do that?
- I dunno.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.525
- I don't know
how you did that.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.394
- That was actually pretty
impressive, Alexis.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.262
- Thanks! I just like wanted
to get to the drinks.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.330
- Uh-huh.
- Congratulations!

18:20.332 --> 18:22.099
Professor Darwin would be
very proud.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.134
- Can I just have my phone,
please?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.736
<i> (Box clunks)</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

18:28.274 --> 18:30.941
- Okay.
- Four voicemails!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.543
- Yes?
- Put it on speaker!

18:32.545 --> 18:34.011
- Okay, is that the button
with the arrow?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.880
- That's the button that says
"speaker"!

18:35.882 --> 18:37.949
- Speaker button!
- Ooh!

18:37.951 --> 18:39.484
<i> Moira: "John,</i>
<i> call me when you can.</i>

18:39.486 --> 18:41.685
<i> We need an excuse to get out</i>

18:41.687 --> 18:43.754
- Okay, skip that. Skip it.
Moira: I have something--

18:43.756 --> 18:45.622
David: "Hi, just reminding you
that you can't bail

18:45.624 --> 18:47.492

18:47.494 --> 18:49.092
Yeah, I don't think we need

18:49.094 --> 18:50.728
- I actually wanna hear
that one.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.030
- I don't think so.
Mike: "Johnny,

18:53.032 --> 18:54.698

18:54.700 --> 18:56.099

19:01.908 --> 19:03.608
- Oh my God!
All: (Excited shouts)

19:03.610 --> 19:04.976
- Did I just hear that?
- Oh, John!

19:04.978 --> 19:06.844
- Did I just... is that what
he just said?!

19:06.846 --> 19:08.980
David: Oh my God!
(Excited shrieks and laughter)

19:08.982 --> 19:12.250
- Oh! (Laughing)
- (Laughing excitedly)

19:12.252 --> 19:14.118
- We got a meeting!

19:14.120 --> 19:16.087
Oh-ho-ho!
- Yeah! (Clapping)

19:16.089 --> 19:17.921
- Why am I still holding this?
- Okay, okay.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.590
Thank you!
- We got a meeting!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.659
All: (Excited shrieks
and laughter)

19:25.264 --> 19:26.930
(Motorcycle rumbles)

19:26.932 --> 19:28.532
- So, for someone who is
all about signs,

19:28.534 --> 19:30.601
what do you think it meant
that you were the one

19:30.603 --> 19:32.537
that got us out of
the Galapagos?

19:32.539 --> 19:34.672
- (Laughs) Honestly? Like...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.607
being in a high-pressure
situation,

19:36.609 --> 19:38.543
with time running out and a lot
of people yelling at me,

19:38.545 --> 19:42.013
it just like... made me feel
like myself again.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.347
- Well, mission accomplished.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.549
And you're out of your
sweatpants,

19:45.551 --> 19:48.352
so things are looking up.
- (Mock giggle)

19:48.354 --> 19:52.156
- I think it might be time
to let go of that succulent.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.558
- Okay, I've been thinking
about that.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.427
Do you think that maybe it died

19:56.429 --> 19:58.696
because it outgrew
its little pot?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.199
- No, I watched you slowly
kill it.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.635
- Like maybe it realized
that it...

20:04.637 --> 20:07.438
missed the bigger pots
that it used to grow in...

20:07.440 --> 20:10.041
and maybe it can't live up
to its full potential

20:10.043 --> 20:12.243
in such a small space?

20:14.347 --> 20:17.748
David, I'm starting to feel
that I'm a lot like the plant.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.517
- I was tracking the metaphor,

20:19.519 --> 20:22.186
but um...

20:22.188 --> 20:23.988
what're you saying?

20:23.990 --> 20:26.724
- I don't know.
Like maybe it's time

20:26.726 --> 20:29.026
I think about being
somewhere else,

20:30.696 --> 20:33.864
finding a bigger pot
to grow in.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.333
- (Shocked) Oh...
(Glasses clinking nearby)

20:35.335 --> 20:37.501
(Music plays, patrons chatter)

20:38.871 --> 20:41.438
<i> Moira: Before we find</i>
<i> ourselves ebrious</i>

20:41.440 --> 20:44.408
with hooch and happiness,

20:44.410 --> 20:48.812
may I say how very proud all
of us are on this day of days.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.881
- Well, we did say no speeches,
so...

20:50.883 --> 20:52.616
- Your father...
- Guess they listened.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.020
- with his pecuniary savvy
and intrepidation

20:56.022 --> 21:00.257
has turned what began as
a katzenjammer of a day

21:00.259 --> 21:02.426
into one filled with faith,

21:03.829 --> 21:05.129
hope and love.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.166
<i> Johnny: Well, thank you,</i>
<i> Sweetheart.</i>

21:09.168 --> 21:11.802
- Well, I think we have
forgotten why we're here.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.171
(Laughs)
It is our bachelor party.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.106
Also, whoever chose
those photos,

21:16.108 --> 21:18.542
<i> they were not approved.</i>
