all better in the bedroom.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.784
- I got a question.
- Yes.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.652
- What does the "BS" stand for
on your shirt?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.154
- [chuckles]
This is a spiritual symbol.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.155
It's not "BS."
- Oh, I that it said "BS."

00:23.224 --> 00:24.189
- [chuckles]
No.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.691

<i> - Oh, my God, this is gonna</i>

Chris and Angelina think
it's just about them,

00:29.730 --> 00:31.296

a group activity.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.798
And Chris isn't having it.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.434
- What I do is I support people
through coaching.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.036
I do it through tantra massage.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.505
And I also do it
through exercises

00:39.573 --> 00:41.473
like we're gonna do today
in this workshop.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.242
So I mentioned something
called tantra.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.710
Does anyone know
what tantra is?

00:44.779 --> 00:46.211
- Sex?
- Oh, my God, is that a club?

00:46.280 --> 00:48.347
- Let's go!
<i> - Busted!</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:50.749
<i> - It's hard to be this fresh.</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:52.418
- We went there on Mondays.
- [chuckles]

00:52.486 --> 00:54.286
- We went to Tantra on Mondays.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.989
- Different parts of your body.
- Is that like a mantra?

00:57.058 --> 01:00.025
- To me, it's self-acceptance,
self-love,

01:00.094 --> 01:01.860
connection, and presence.

01:01.929 --> 01:05.497
So we're gonna do one exercise
that's in a tantric realm.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.232
A lot of times
we're just touching people,

01:07.301 --> 01:08.600
and maybe we're
not even asking,

01:08.669 --> 01:09.968
or we don't know
how our partner

01:10.037 --> 01:12.438
or people that we're touching
actually enjoy it.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.741
- I know this guy is going
to hone in on me and Chris.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.309
I'm waiting for it.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.378
It's coming, people.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.379
It's coming.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.148
- So I'd love to ask

01:23.217 --> 01:24.716
Deena and Chris...
- Oh, my God.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.318
- To come on up
to the center...

01:26.387 --> 01:28.554
- Yeah!
- And practice this exercise.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.788
- This is exactly
what you didn't want.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.390
- It's your party!

01:31.459 --> 01:33.792
- I know that Chris and Deena
are kind of, like, low-key

01:33.861 --> 01:36.061

01:36.130 --> 01:39.231

I know that...

01:39.300 --> 01:40.232
the Bucks [bleep].

01:40.301 --> 01:41.400
[laughs]

01:41.469 --> 01:42.935
- First of all,
before you touch someone,

01:43.003 --> 01:44.636
it's really good
to come into your own presence,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.038
to maybe
rub your hands together,

01:46.107 --> 01:47.139
feel your own energy...

01:47.208 --> 01:48.774
- [exhales onto hands]
[both laugh]

01:48.843 --> 01:51.677
- And let go of anything

01:51.745 --> 01:53.112
that doesn't serve you
right now.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.247
So one of you can choose
to receive first.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.116
- [chuckles]
- You do like receiving first.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.550
- Oral!

01:58.619 --> 02:01.453
- Hold your hands above
wherever you want on the body.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.821
But you're gonna
hold your hands above,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.556
and you're gonna experience
receiving this touch.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.758
Do you feel
the subtleties of energy?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.660
And you can communicate
if it's something you like,

02:08.729 --> 02:09.761
you don't like, faster, slower.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.896
- It is nice.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.764

- That's gonna be the nightcap.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.303
- For dessert,
the lie detector technician's

39:33.372 --> 39:35.105
gonna take your order.
- [laughs]

39:37.209 --> 39:40.243
- Whoo!
all: "Family Vacation"!

39:40.312 --> 39:43.012
- I found my wine, bitch!

39:43.081 --> 39:44.547
Yes, queen!

39:44.616 --> 39:46.716
- All right.
Did you ever kill anyone?

39:46.785 --> 39:47.817
Do you train legs?

39:47.886 --> 39:48.885
Do you shave the back door?

39:48.954 --> 39:49.886
Do you like your ass [bleep]?

39:49.955 --> 39:52.789
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh!

39:52.858 --> 39:55.291
- What in the world?
- Oh, damn!

39:55.360 --> 39:58.495
- Inconclusive.
all: Oh!

39:58.563 --> 40:01.398
- [mouth full]
I love you so much.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.665
You're gorgeous.
