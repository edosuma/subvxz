00:02.101 --> 00:05.554
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:05.647 --> 00:07.724
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:07.817 --> 00:12.646
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:12.740 --> 00:16.360
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:16.454 --> 00:20.535
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:20.626 --> 00:22.703
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

01:40.066 --> 01:43.221
[Face] We"ll be in Bad Rock in a couple
of minutes. How is he?

01:43.112 --> 01:46.363
[Hannibal] Blood pressure"s 90 over 30
and dropping fast.

01:46.449 --> 01:48.526
We gotta get him some blood.

01:48.619 --> 01:52.285
Gonna need for the Faceman
to change his name. Yeah, to Broken Face.

01:52.374 --> 01:55.994
- Come on, B.A. It wasn't my fault.
- You were supposed to be the rear guard.

01:56.087 --> 01:58.840
You messed up bad.
Now I have to mess you up.

01:58.925 --> 02:02.129
- It's the law.
- Oh, brother.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.171
[B.A.] Face is gonna pay.
Face is gonna pay.

02:34.264 --> 02:36.340
Face is gonna pay.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.510
Wait. Keep him up there.

02:38.603 --> 02:40.680
I got one leg.

02:40.772 --> 02:43.644
[B.A. Panting]

02:43.735 --> 02:46.523
[Groans]

02:46.614 --> 02:48.903
[Face]
These things happen, man.

02:48.992 --> 02:53.536
Remember that time in 'Nam
when you were supposed to be watching
the back door of that Chinese dance hall?

02:53.623 --> 02:56.958
And I slipped and cut myself
on that Coke bottle that you dropped.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.212
Did I get mad? No.
These things happen.

03:01.717 --> 03:04.636
[Knocking]

03:04.721 --> 03:08.637
- Who is it?
- [Face]
We need a doctor! lt"s an emergency!

03:10.020 --> 03:13.057
- Is Dr Sullivan in?
- I'm Dr Sullivan. Bring him in.

03:13.149 --> 03:16.353
- I don't want no lady doctor
to work on me.
- Ignore him. He's in shock.

03:16.445 --> 03:19.566
Hunting accident. Shot in the leg.
He's lost a lot of blood, Doctor.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.576
All right, bring him here.
Put him on the table.

03:26.876 --> 03:29.368
How long ago did it happen?

03:29.463 --> 03:31.670
3.00 this morning.

03:31.758 --> 03:34.380
Was he unconscious
for any length of time?

03:34.469 --> 03:36.712
No. Can you help him?

03:36.806 --> 03:39.380
Better hope so, sucker!

03:39.476 --> 03:42.597
[Groaning Continues]

03:42.689 --> 03:45.442
Get that light for me, would you?

03:45.526 --> 03:48.611
- Just lie still.
- [Continues Groaning]

03:52.202 --> 03:54.776
We're with you, buddy.
It's gonna be all right.

03:54.872 --> 03:59.915
- I promise.
- You better not promise, Face.
You better pray!

04:01.631 --> 04:04.253
You guys wanna get outta here
so I can get to work?

04:04.343 --> 04:06.716
It was my fault.

04:06.805 --> 04:10.554
It was nobody's fault. We got the client
out alive. That's what counts.

04:10.643 --> 04:13.764
You're not the one he wants
to bust into little pieces.

04:13.856 --> 04:16.858
- Did you see the look in his eye?
- Oh, yeah. Scary.

04:16.942 --> 04:21.440
[Sighs] Hannibal, you... you'll talk him
out of it, won't you?

04:21.533 --> 04:25.448
Face, if anybody could talk
B.A. out of anything...

04:25.538 --> 04:27.615
he'd be a professional wrestler.

04:27.708 --> 04:30.330
Now, give him some time.
He'll... He'll cool off.

04:30.420 --> 04:33.872
The worst thing that could
happen to you is that he's gonna
take a couple of swings at you.

04:33.966 --> 04:36.043
One oughta do it.

04:36.136 --> 04:38.628
Face, B.A. loves you.

04:38.722 --> 04:42.306
- Yeah... He does?
- He told me so himself.

04:45.106 --> 04:47.645
- How is he, Doc?
- Not very good.

04:47.735 --> 04:50.690
Your friend has a.50-calibre
hole in his leg.

04:50.780 --> 04:54.566
I had to tie off an artery.
It took 60 stitches to close him up.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.737
What were you hunting? Elephants?

04:56.830 --> 05:00.580
- Quail.
- Uh, you know, uh... [Sputters]

05:00.669 --> 05:03.457
Doc, how soon
can we take him out of here?

05:03.547 --> 05:07.843
He needs blood. I can't locate any
AB negative. It's a very unusual type.

05:07.928 --> 05:10.599
He's a very unusual guy.

05:10.682 --> 05:13.304
We'll get you the blood,
and then we'll take him out of here.

05:13.394 --> 05:16.266
No, I'm sorry. He's not going anywhere
until I can stabilize him.

05:16.356 --> 05:20.854
AB negative is a very rare blood type. We'll
be lucky if we can come up with a pint of it.

05:20.946 --> 05:25.325
We happen to know a very rare guy
who has that type of blood.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.617
How are we gonna get
Murdock up here?

05:27.705 --> 05:30.873
Amy'll get him out of the hospital for us.
Can I use your phone, Doc?

05:39.804 --> 05:42.475
[Phone Ringing]

05:42.558 --> 05:44.635
[Hannibal On Phone]
Amy Allen, please.

05:44.728 --> 05:46.804
Where are you guys?
I was getting worried.

05:46.897 --> 05:51.810
We got in a firefight. We need Murdock.
You're gonna have to get him
out of the hospital for us.

05:51.904 --> 05:53.981
Me? By myself?

05:54.074 --> 05:58.986
Just call him up and tell him,
"Red Ball One, bag is leaking."

05:59.080 --> 06:02.700
- Got that?
- Come on, Hannibal. Let me in on it.

06:02.794 --> 06:05.582
You just tell Murdock.
He'll know what to do.

06:05.673 --> 06:10.751
We're in Bad Rock with a...
a doctor named Sullivan. Got it?

06:10.846 --> 06:12.923
Got it.

06:37.882 --> 06:40.505
Hello, Jack? This is Mo Sullivan.
Is the sheriff in?

06:40.594 --> 06:43.169
[Man] Yeah, Mo, he"s here.
l- l"ll get him for ya.

06:43.265 --> 06:47.762
Hey, Sheriff. Doc Sullivan's on the phone.
She wants to talk at ya.

06:47.854 --> 06:53.610
[Laughing] You better answer the phone,
Sheriff. You ain't got much time left.

06:53.695 --> 06:58.608
Ain't no way the Barbarians are gonna
let you put me on ice for the feds.

06:58.702 --> 07:02.748
No way. You're in it, man.
[Laughing]

07:02.833 --> 07:05.704
You are in it bad.

07:05.795 --> 07:09.212
Nobody's comin' back for you, punk.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.423
Yeah, Mo. What's up?

07:11.511 --> 07:16.139
Uh, Hank, I could have
some trouble here.

07:16.226 --> 07:19.014
A couple of guys brought somebody
into my house this morning.

07:19.104 --> 07:22.309
- He's been pretty badly shot up.
- Is it this motorcycle gang?

07:22.401 --> 07:24.643
The guy who was shot could be.

07:24.737 --> 07:27.941
He's got a Mohawk and about two tons
of gold and bad manners.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.525
I'll be over
in a couple of minutes.

07:34.584 --> 07:38.120
Goin' over to Doc Sullivan's.
Nobody comes through that door but me.

07:38.213 --> 07:43.126
[Laughing] Man, that old tub of lard
can't stand up to my boys.

07:43.220 --> 07:46.970
We will eat that pig for lunch.
[Laughing]

08:23.316 --> 08:25.392
Gin.

08:26.612 --> 08:28.771
Face!

08:28.865 --> 08:30.988
Doctor, is he any better?

08:31.076 --> 08:33.153
No. And he's not going to be...

08:33.246 --> 08:36.532
until that other friend of yours
gets here and gives him some blood.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.912
Doctor, we've got to ask
your confidence on this. Nobody can know.

08:40.005 --> 08:43.042
As soon as he's well enough to move,
we'll get him out of here.

08:43.134 --> 08:45.840
We'll pay cash... $5,000.
Is that enough?

08:45.929 --> 08:49.928
I'm not interested in your money.
I just want to know what happened
to my patient.

08:50.018 --> 08:52.095
I haven't seen a wound like that
since Vietnam.

08:52.188 --> 08:54.762
You were in Vietnam.

08:54.858 --> 08:59.569
You must've been a captain.
You'll forgive me if I don't salute.

08:59.656 --> 09:02.195
He's a colonel.

09:02.285 --> 09:04.907
Freeze it... or lose it.

09:04.997 --> 09:08.201
Raise 'em nice and slow.

09:08.293 --> 09:11.497
Stick 'em up, Colonel.

09:11.589 --> 09:13.666
Search him, Mo.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.851
Nine-millimetre! It's nice.

09:27.944 --> 09:33.285
No doubt about it.
You're on a cold streak here.

09:41.796 --> 09:46.175
'Course you realize when we run
these prints through, we are gonna
find out who you guys are.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.337
I told you before,
we're ballet dancers.

09:48.430 --> 09:50.838
That guy over at Doc's
is our choreographer.

09:50.933 --> 09:55.763
Yeah, we had a nasty audience.
I don't think they liked our pas de deux.

09:55.857 --> 09:59.808
Opened up on us from the first row
with a.50-calibre machine gun.

09:59.904 --> 10:02.822
All right, let's go.
Cover me.

10:02.908 --> 10:05.031
Mm-hmm.

10:05.119 --> 10:07.326
Punch these clowns
up on the computer.

10:07.414 --> 10:10.084
Run their prints
for outstanding warrants.

10:11.461 --> 10:15.294
[Chuckles] All right! More dog meat
for the party.

10:15.383 --> 10:18.718
You see, we're throwin' this little party.
Y'all are invited.

10:18.804 --> 10:21.296
Who's the 200-pound cockroach?

10:23.853 --> 10:27.519
He's in more trouble than you guys. Pulled
him over for speeding and ran his prints.

10:27.608 --> 10:31.144
He's got outstanding warrants
for Murder One in two states.

10:31.237 --> 10:34.405
[Laughs]
You ain't gettin' me to trial, man.

10:34.492 --> 10:37.328
My boys are gonna come in here
and bust me out.

10:37.412 --> 10:40.450
Oh, we'll get you there, Jenko.
Bet on it.

10:40.542 --> 10:44.291
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Yeah, this is Deputy Harmson.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.593
l"ve got a couple of guys down here I
want you to run through your computer.

10:48.678 --> 10:51.882
Waste of time, Deputy.
We have friends in very high places.

10:51.974 --> 10:54.596
- [Alarm Ringing]
- [Man On P.A.] Lockdown. Lockdown.

10:54.686 --> 10:58.020
Patient Murdock escaping
from video game and arcade room.

10:58.107 --> 11:00.729
[Alarm Continues Ringing]

11:04.824 --> 11:07.910
Pedal to the metal, sweetheart!

11:34.906 --> 11:37.825
[Sirens Blaring]

11:42.792 --> 11:45.462
[Harmson]
Okay. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

11:45.546 --> 11:49.130
[Chuckling]

11:49.217 --> 11:54.593
Oh, Sheriff, that was Military Intelligence.

11:54.683 --> 11:59.679
Would you believe they've been looking
for them two yahoos since the end
of the Vietnam War?

11:59.773 --> 12:01.897
No kiddin'? For what?

12:01.984 --> 12:05.401
[Chuckles]
Robbin' the Bank of Hanoi.

12:05.489 --> 12:10.402
They"re gonna send some M.P. s
over here. They oughta be here
some time late this afternoon.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.913
[Thompson] Good. I don"t wanna have
to sit on anyone but Sonny Jenko.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.916
[Harmson] Well, listen.
Military Intelligence said we best
keep our eye on that white-haired fellow.

12:18.006 --> 12:20.961
That is John "Hannibal" Smith.
Colonel.

12:21.052 --> 12:23.840
He"s some kind of escape artist
or somethin'.

12:23.930 --> 12:26.849
I mean, he already busted
out of Fort Bragg once.

12:26.934 --> 12:29.936
Nobody's gonna break out
of my jail.

12:37.449 --> 12:39.525
Come on, Colonel.
The Bank of Hanoi?

12:39.618 --> 12:43.035
Yeah. We kinda liked
that one ourselves.

12:43.123 --> 12:46.789
- Could say we had a yen
for some extra money.
- [Groans]

12:46.878 --> 12:50.046
[Thompson]
Yeah, well, you"ll have a chance to tell
that all to the military court.

12:50.132 --> 12:53.384
We have some M.P. s comin"up
here to take you guys back home
to your stockade.

12:53.470 --> 12:56.342
No offence, Sheriff,
but that's been tried before.

12:56.432 --> 12:59.268
You"re not breakin"outta here, Smith.
[Sighs]

12:59.353 --> 13:02.854
They already told us how you and
your guys broke out of Fort Bragg.

13:02.941 --> 13:05.896
- My jail's different.
- [Laughs]

13:05.987 --> 13:09.689
Sheriff, you gotta be kiddin' about
this place. I could break outta here
on horseback.

13:09.784 --> 13:13.236
- Here you go, kid.
- Well, I'll take my chances, Houdini.

13:13.330 --> 13:16.996
Wanna put some money on that?
Twenty dollars says he can do it.

13:17.085 --> 13:20.372
Cro-Magnon there
can hold the money for us.

13:20.465 --> 13:24.416
You got a real mouth on you, kid.
My boys break me outta here...

13:24.512 --> 13:27.134
I'm gonna come over there
and shut it myself!

13:27.224 --> 13:30.510
You expectin' company, Sheriff?
We might stick around.

13:30.603 --> 13:33.095
Nobody"s comin" back for that creep.
His gang"s long gone.

13:33.190 --> 13:35.896
And you're not goin'
anywhere, either, Colonel.

13:35.986 --> 13:39.771
Uh, never underestimate
your enemy, Sheriff.

13:39.866 --> 13:44.197
- Overconfidence is a real killer.
- I think General Custer said that.

13:44.288 --> 13:48.501
Don't worry about me. Just worry about
what you're gonna say to the military court
when they send you up for life.

13:48.586 --> 13:52.454
I never worry.
But if slimy over there is right...

13:52.549 --> 13:55.006
we could be taking on
a little water.

13:55.094 --> 13:57.384
Gin.

14:13.369 --> 14:17.617
[Men Hooting, Cheering]

14:19.711 --> 14:24.955
All right! Now we got the sheriff cut off
completely from the rest of the world!

14:25.051 --> 14:27.804
- Yeah.
- Let's go get Sonny.

14:27.889 --> 14:31.223
We swing by Bernie's Café.
We pick up the rest of the brothers.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.552
We go in and take that town
down to the sewers.

14:33.646 --> 14:36.933
- [All Shouting, Cheering]
- Crank "em up!

15:25.883 --> 15:28.671
Okay, baby.
I'll see you tonight.

15:30.514 --> 15:34.845
Oh, good. I'm glad you're back.
I-I was afraid to leave these guys alone.

15:34.937 --> 15:39.185
That was Doc Sullivan.
She's still trying to locate some blood
for that buddy of theirs that was shot up.

15:39.276 --> 15:42.729
And once he's stabilized, we'll move him
in here and hold him for the M.P.s.

15:42.822 --> 15:46.275
Mmm. What time are the feds
comin' by for Jenko?

15:46.369 --> 15:48.493
Maybe tonight, early morning.

15:48.580 --> 15:52.531
They got to, uh, swing by Sacramento
and pick up some extradition papers.

15:52.627 --> 15:56.247
Hmm. You know, Sheriff, it...
it just doesn't seem right to me.

15:56.341 --> 16:00.042
I mean, the Barbarians just lettin"us
take their boss away like that...

16:00.137 --> 16:02.546
I mean, without even throwin'
a few rocks or somethin'.

16:02.641 --> 16:05.477
The Barbarians are punks.
They don't have the guts.

16:05.561 --> 16:08.978
Hmm. Well, I hope you're right.
[Clears Throat]

16:09.066 --> 16:11.736
All right, boys.
It's feedin' time at the zoo.

16:11.820 --> 16:14.442
Everybody get up and
let's have a little lunch here.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.739
Wake up, Colonel.
It's lunch-time.

16:16.826 --> 16:19.663
- Oh, I'd, uh, forget the colonel.
He went out to lunch.
- Oh... What?

16:19.747 --> 16:23.877
Yeah. You really shouldn"t
leave guys like us unattended.

16:23.961 --> 16:28.375
Hey, Sheriff, get over here!
[Shuddering]

16:35.268 --> 16:38.804
Damn! Let's go.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.900
Uh, don't forget.
You owe me 20 bucks.

16:47.326 --> 16:49.403
- Nice work, Hannibal.
- Thanks.

16:49.495 --> 16:51.987
[Laughing]

16:57.506 --> 16:59.832
Set up the squad car. I'll call...

16:59.926 --> 17:02.963
That won"t be necessary, Sheriff.
Now, keep your hands...

17:03.055 --> 17:06.057
right where they are.

17:06.143 --> 17:09.394
- Over there. Side by side.
- How did you get outta there?

17:09.481 --> 17:12.897
Claustrophobia. Tight places
give me the creeps.

17:19.536 --> 17:23.404
All right, gentlemen.
Step into our finest room.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.789
No phones, no pool, no pets,
but you're gonna love your new neighbour.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.715
Face, get over to the van.
Get on the radio.

17:32.803 --> 17:35.924
- Murdock should be in range by now.
- Gotcha.

17:36.016 --> 17:40.229
Hey, man, let me outta here.
I'll make sure you got a motorcycle
escort all the way to the state line.

17:40.314 --> 17:44.099
- No deal. I couldn't stand the smell.
- You're gonna pay for that, man!

17:44.194 --> 17:47.112
I'm gonna cut you a cheque
next time I'm at the bank, man.

17:48.491 --> 17:52.407
Sorry, Sheriff. We just don't
get on well with military police.

17:52.497 --> 17:56.496
But as soon as l"m out of town,
l"ll drop the keys to someone
and have "em get you out.

17:56.585 --> 18:00.585
You're never gettin' away with this.
Feds are coming, so are the M.P.s.
You'll never make it out of the county.

18:00.674 --> 18:04.044
Maybe. But I gotta try.

18:04.137 --> 18:07.258
It's something that stems
from my childhood.

18:07.350 --> 18:13.022
I just gotta play against the house.
So long, lizard breath.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.951
How much farther?

18:28.044 --> 18:32.293
Five, 10 miles.
Take Junction 82 south.

18:33.886 --> 18:36.377
What do you think happened?

18:36.472 --> 18:39.011
I don't know. It was
supposed to be a simple gig.

18:39.101 --> 18:41.178
There was no air support,
no nothin'.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.762
Just spring some oil man's son
from his kidnappers.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.729
But we got a "Red Ball One."
That's big trouble.

18:46.820 --> 18:49.358
"Bag's leaking" means
one of the team took some lead.

18:49.448 --> 18:51.904
Well, it couldn't have been Hannibal.
He made the call.

18:51.993 --> 18:54.781
Nope. Hannibal's not the one
under the gun.

18:54.872 --> 18:58.657
Um, give me that radio down there,
would ya, hot potato?

18:58.752 --> 19:02.169
We should be in range pretty soon.

19:02.257 --> 19:04.963
Shootin' it out at high noon,
maybe we can raise the van...

19:05.052 --> 19:08.007
pull the A-Team...
outta the can.

19:12.187 --> 19:14.857
- Did you get 'em yet?
- No. They must still be out of range.

19:14.941 --> 19:19.070
Keep workin' on it. I'll try to soften up
the doc before she calls in the heat.

19:19.155 --> 19:22.691
[Radio Static]

19:22.785 --> 19:25.870
- How do you feel?
- Feel pretty weak, mama.

19:25.955 --> 19:29.123
Well, you'll be getting some strength
back as soon as we get you some blood.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.784
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in jail?

19:31.880 --> 19:36.544
Sorry, Doctor. We're gonna have to
do things my way. But don't worry;
I won't hurt you. How're you doin', B.A.?

19:36.636 --> 19:40.338
- Hangin' in there?
- Real tired, man. Leg hurt bad.

19:40.433 --> 19:44.266
- We'll get you home real soon.
- Nobody seems to be listening to me.

19:44.355 --> 19:47.061
I told you, the man cannot be moved
until he gets some blood.

19:47.151 --> 19:50.022
Will you get the fire out of your eye, Doc?
We got some blood on the way.

19:50.113 --> 19:53.317
- Hannibal always comes through.
- Murdock'll be here right away.

19:53.409 --> 19:57.028
- You're the same blood type. We'll do
a transfusion and get you on your feet.
- Murdock?

19:57.122 --> 20:01.702
- You're both AB negative, remember?
- I ain't swappin' blood with that sucker!
He's crazy!

20:01.795 --> 20:06.091
B.A., he"s the only donor we have, unless
we"re gonna get you into Cedars-Sinai.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.419
You have very special blood.

20:08.513 --> 20:11.431
I ain't gonna let you pump
none of Murdock's crazy juice in me.

20:11.517 --> 20:16.014
- No way, man. He's nuts.
- No, he isn't, B.A. Not really.

20:21.155 --> 20:24.073
This is Howling Mad, flyin'
high cover on the Red Ball One.

20:24.159 --> 20:27.410
I'm comin' in low and sideways
to plug the bag.

20:27.496 --> 20:29.704
A-Team in need, do you read?

20:31.001 --> 20:34.003
Outta range.
That's kinda strange.

20:34.089 --> 20:37.256
Uh, Murdock,
what is with all the poetry?

20:37.343 --> 20:40.464
Yeah, I noticed that too.

20:40.556 --> 20:43.723
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I got my words, and my brain's workin' fine.

20:43.810 --> 20:49.482
But when the words come out,
they want to... rhyme.

20:49.568 --> 20:52.653
- Oh.
- [Face On Radio]
Murdock, is that you? Come in.

20:52.739 --> 20:56.607
This is your man, Howling Mad.
What's the buzz, Face?

20:56.702 --> 20:59.740
[Face] Listen. B.A. "s been hit.
We need some of your AB negative.

20:59.831 --> 21:02.786
There"s a doctor"s house on your left
as you come through town.

21:02.877 --> 21:04.954
l"ll be waitin" for you.

21:16.729 --> 21:19.565
No need to wait, Face.
I think this is the place.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.727
Okay, he's inside.

21:25.866 --> 21:28.821
[Hannibal]
B.A., you lie still.

21:28.912 --> 21:32.413
Man, I'm warnin' y'all for the last time.
I don't want this sucker's blood in me.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.123
It's gonna make me crazy
just like he is.

21:35.212 --> 21:38.167
It's not gonna make you crazy, B.A.
It's just gonna make you mellow.

21:38.258 --> 21:41.462
You could even room with me at the V.A.
I'll have them bring in an extra bunk...

21:41.554 --> 21:43.844
and you and I can watch
the walls melt.

21:43.932 --> 21:46.970
- Hannibal!
- Lay off, will ya, Murdock?

21:47.062 --> 21:49.767
Lay off what? This man
has a chance for greatness.

21:49.857 --> 21:53.393
My bodily fluids are in great demand
by the finest minds of our time.

21:53.487 --> 21:55.776
I give a fresh specimen
to the V.A. every week.

21:55.865 --> 21:58.737
Worst that can happen is he starts
to hear things that he don"t see...

21:58.827 --> 22:01.782
and rhyme his words just like me.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.753
- Gonna get you for this, Face!
- What are you talking about?

22:05.837 --> 22:08.210
Faceman messed up.
That"s why I got shot.

22:08.298 --> 22:12.594
That's why I need this sucker's blood.
Gonna make me crazy, just like he is.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.088
That's why the Faceman gotta pay.

22:15.183 --> 22:17.721
Hannibal, I'll go get the van
ready to transport him.

22:17.811 --> 22:20.220
Try and cool him down for me, will ya?

22:20.315 --> 22:23.352
My blood'll cool him down for you, Face.

22:23.444 --> 22:26.896
[B.A. Groaning]
Gonna get you for this, Face.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.280
I can feel myself gettin' crazy already.

22:29.368 --> 22:31.445
Yeah, first your ears start to ring...

22:31.538 --> 22:33.827
and then, every once in a while,
your eyes start to fog over...

22:33.916 --> 22:35.993
and you start to rhyme your words.

22:36.086 --> 22:39.004
You're nuts, man.
Who ever heard of me rhymin' my words?

22:39.090 --> 22:42.958
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
My ears don't ring. I don't hear a thing.

22:43.053 --> 22:45.130
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, wait a minute, sucker!

22:45.223 --> 22:47.679
You see? Foam the runway!
B.A. is comin' in!

22:47.768 --> 22:50.723
[Makes Aeroplane Noise]
Let me know when your eyes start to fog.

22:50.814 --> 22:53.021
B.A., Murdock's blood
is not gonna do a thing to you.

22:53.109 --> 22:55.351
Blood is blood. It's all the same.
You know, it's red...

22:55.445 --> 22:58.019
No, it ain't. Mine is special.
Once upon a time, I didn't have a dime.

22:58.115 --> 23:01.283
My head went crazy. They said I was lazy,
but I'm gettin' by, on the fly...

23:01.370 --> 23:04.574
Murdock, knock it off!
You're diggin' my grave here with B.A.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.992
Rock 'n' roll.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.209
[Groaning]

23:09.297 --> 23:12.050
You know you shouldn't move him.

23:12.134 --> 23:14.211
We have no choice.

23:16.181 --> 23:20.180
I know it doesn't seem like it, Doc,
but we are the guys in the white hats.

23:20.270 --> 23:23.272
Then why are you wanted
by the military police?

23:23.358 --> 23:27.653
It's a long story, and no one
wants to listen. We're on the run.

23:27.738 --> 23:30.906
If any of us get caught, we get
20 years in a federal slammer.

23:42.967 --> 23:46.800
Uh, that's supposed to be
some sort of macho pass, and now
I'm supposed to blush, right?

23:54.858 --> 23:57.315
I don't make passes.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.480
Or promises.

23:59.573 --> 24:02.491
The mystery man just sort of
rides off into the sunset...

24:02.577 --> 24:04.654

24:04.746 --> 24:07.155
Yeah. Somethin' like that.

24:12.924 --> 24:17.718
But... in the meantime,
you'll have to wait.

24:17.806 --> 24:20.808
Wait! Oh, that's real cute, Hannibal!
Let me out of here!

24:20.893 --> 24:23.729
- [Pounding]
- Uh, I'll let you out of there
as soon as I can.

24:23.814 --> 24:26.140
And if it helps any...

24:26.234 --> 24:29.770
putting you in the closet
was not my first choice.

24:29.863 --> 24:33.150
Oh, well, that"s just real great!
Meanwhile, that"s where I am!
In the closet!

24:33.243 --> 24:35.320
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- Hannibal!

24:35.413 --> 24:38.415
Come on! Let me out of here!
Stop foolin"around!

24:52.394 --> 24:55.099
- Murdock?
- Yeah, Colonel.

24:55.189 --> 24:58.275
The local sheriff turned us over
to the military police.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.232
They could be on us anytime.
If you see any heat comin' in...

25:01.322 --> 25:05.072

and get Amy out of there.

Those creeps are probably here
to bust their boss out of jail.

25:54.394 --> 25:58.179
- The sheriff's gonna be dog meat.
- Yeah, he is, isn't he?

25:58.274 --> 26:01.192
- You know, I've been thinkin' about that.
- Me too.

26:01.278 --> 26:03.485
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:03.573 --> 26:07.619
I mean, he didn't do anything wrong,
and it's not nice to lock somebody up
in their own jail.

26:07.703 --> 26:10.824

to do his job.

Amy, you stay with B.A.

26:34.281 --> 26:38.149
Murdock, do you think
you could fire this crane up?

26:38.244 --> 26:41.365
- If it had wings, I could fly it.
- Murdock?

26:41.457 --> 26:44.375
- No problem, Colonel.
- Face, see if that cable
will move to the other side.

26:44.461 --> 26:47.379
- What are we doing?
- We're gonna slow
these Barbarians down...

26:47.465 --> 26:50.253
so we can get back to the sheriff
and help him dig in for the attack.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.421

on their way?

make this sucker shut up?

30:03.228 --> 30:05.305

for the sheriff"s office.

30:05.397 --> 30:08.020

on these geeks.

Hannibal. We got M.P. s on the way.

two, three hours in order to...

31:37.020 --> 31:39.726
I'm not a cop. I'm a fugitive.

31:39.816 --> 31:43.767
And every now and then, I like to drop
the hammer on a piece of dirt.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.315
You are nuts, man!

31:52.833 --> 31:55.456
Well, what's your story, man!

31:55.545 --> 31:59.212
Hi. I'm the blood lady.

31:59.300 --> 32:03.216
I give blood to guys with holes in 'em,
and perhaps we can do business,
muchacho.

32:03.306 --> 32:07.221
Because I got a feelin' you're gonna be
leakin' from three or four holes in a minute.

32:07.311 --> 32:10.479
Our rates are low.
It's $20 a pint.

32:10.565 --> 32:15.028
We've got a special on...
if you buy in bulk.

32:15.113 --> 32:16.905
Now, here's the deal.

32:16.991 --> 32:20.990
We'll let you out and help you with the
bikers, and you forget you ever saw us.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.494
If you let me out, what's to prevent me
from bringing in the National Guard
and bustin' the whole bunch of you?

32:25.586 --> 32:28.042
The Barbarians
have cut the phone lines.

32:28.131 --> 32:30.539
The radio in our van
can't get over the mountains.

32:30.634 --> 32:33.636
Which means yours
probably can't, either.

32:33.722 --> 32:36.889
But you know that.
We're kind of in the same boat, Sheriff.

32:36.976 --> 32:40.428
You read the printout on us.
We were a combat team in "Nam.

32:40.522 --> 32:43.727
We're weapons and tactics experts.
We enjoy a challenge.

32:43.818 --> 32:46.108
- How much time we got?
- About an hour and a half.

32:46.197 --> 32:50.575
[Sighs] I can't make a deal
with a wanted man.

32:50.661 --> 32:53.948
I can't agree to have fugitives
protect this town.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.660
- l"m a police officer.
- Sheriff, if I were you,
I would not debate technicalities.

32:57.754 --> 33:01.835
Sheriff, those Barbarians are killers.

33:01.926 --> 33:04.845
I mean, a lot of people
in this town could get hurt.

33:04.930 --> 33:07.718
And we're locked up in here.

33:14.109 --> 33:16.268
Okay, let me out.

33:16.362 --> 33:21.275
First I want your handshake
you're not gonna pull down on us
with your badge and gun.

33:21.369 --> 33:23.861
A handshake isn't exactly
a binding agreement.

33:23.956 --> 33:27.326
When you live on the edge,
you learn to make fast evaluations.

33:27.419 --> 33:32.166
Your life depends on "em. My take on you
is... your handshake is your bond.

33:46.736 --> 33:49.062
[Sullivan]
Hey! Who"s out there?

33:52.995 --> 33:55.665
- Well, thanks a whole lot!
- Look, I know you're angry.

33:55.748 --> 33:59.617
Lady, angry doesn't
even begin to cover it.

33:59.712 --> 34:02.418
Tough. The Barbarians are
10 or 15 miles up the road.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.797
They're planning to come in here
and burn this town down.

34:04.886 --> 34:08.137
Hannibal and the others could've gone on,
but they came back to help.

34:08.223 --> 34:11.842
So you were stuck in a closet
for an hour. Big deal.

34:15.859 --> 34:17.982
How's my patient?

34:18.070 --> 34:20.313
Better.
He's starting to growl again.

34:22.034 --> 34:24.442
Barbarians, huh?

34:24.536 --> 34:27.409
Well, that should liven up
the pace around here...

34:27.498 --> 34:29.576
for a Sunday afternoon.

34:31.338 --> 34:36.380
[Hannibal]
Nah, you're not gonna have to move Jenko.
All you gotta do is stuff a sock in his mouth.

34:36.469 --> 34:39.388
Not move him? They're gonna
roll in here and shoot up this jail.

34:39.474 --> 34:41.966
No, they're not.
They're gonna roll in here...

34:42.061 --> 34:45.312
and shoot up that vacant real estate
office on the corner across the street.

34:45.398 --> 34:48.150
- They are, huh?
- You betcha.

34:49.904 --> 34:52.739
- Why are they gonna do that?
- Well, they're gonna do that...

34:52.824 --> 34:55.495
'cause they're gonna think
it's the sheriff's office.

34:57.540 --> 35:01.206
[Making Engine Noises]

35:03.631 --> 35:06.586
[Screeches]

35:06.677 --> 35:09.085
Gonna need speakers, man.
Big ones.

35:09.180 --> 35:11.138
They gotta sound real good.

35:11.225 --> 35:13.265
I'll do the best I can, but...

35:13.353 --> 35:16.937
Hey, Faceman, when my blood brother
says he wants a...

35:19.235 --> 35:22.072
I wanna be close
to the mechanical stuff.

35:22.156 --> 35:24.944
But I'm gonna need somebody
to wheel me around.

35:25.035 --> 35:28.405
Hey, hey, hey, I am a pilot!
[Makes Aeroplane Noise]

35:28.498 --> 35:32.034
I'm not a nurse's aide.
I respectfully refuse...

35:32.128 --> 35:35.332
on the grounds
that I'm not strong enough...

35:35.424 --> 35:39.126
to wheel this big, mean, ugly
mudsucker around.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.092
Besides, I lost blood and I feel faint.

35:42.183 --> 35:45.268
You better do it, or I'll take
the rest of your blood the hard way!

35:45.354 --> 35:49.139
Well, on the other... hand,
blood is thicker than water.

35:57.161 --> 36:00.496
- What do ya say, Doc?
- Hank, what's happening?

36:00.583 --> 36:04.831
Well, near as I figure, in about an hour
from now, we're gonna have our hands full.

36:04.922 --> 36:09.003
That abandoned real estate office
will give us our best tactical advantage.

36:09.094 --> 36:14.007
The best field of fire is in the church
steeple at the other end of town.

36:14.101 --> 36:17.138
So we'll run 'em down there,
turn the grizzlies around...

36:17.230 --> 36:19.520
and then run 'em through
a very special gauntlet.

36:19.608 --> 36:22.610
If you ladies'll wait in the office,
the sheriff'll bring you some paint.

36:22.696 --> 36:26.611
I'm gonna check out the church steeple.
We better get going.
We haven't got much time.

36:29.663 --> 36:32.238
- Put me down, fool! Put me down!
- Shut up!

36:32.334 --> 36:34.790
Put me down!
Slow it down, fool!

36:35.922 --> 36:38.211
I don't understand.
A motorcycle gang?

36:38.300 --> 36:41.255
That fella I got in jail, he's their leader.
They're comin' back to bust him out.

36:41.346 --> 36:44.383
- Why don't you call for help?
- We can't. They busted
all the phone lines.

36:44.475 --> 36:46.931
- We're completely cut off.
- We're gonna need
some hardware supplies.

36:47.020 --> 36:50.224
But first I want you to get everybody
in town and tell 'em what's going on.

36:50.316 --> 36:53.104
Then get the women and children
in vehicles and get them out of town.

36:53.195 --> 36:55.105
- Jack here'll help you.
- Right.

36:55.198 --> 36:58.698
Gonna need that metal platin'.
And get me some of this audio wire.

36:58.786 --> 37:01.028
You know, I just love you.

37:01.122 --> 37:03.910
We are brothers
under the skin, aren't we?

37:04.001 --> 37:07.502
Come on, sucker! I ain't got time
for your crazy rap! Ooh!

38:10.424 --> 38:13.426
- What are these for?
- Grills. They make great grills.

38:13.511 --> 38:16.762
- Grills?
- I thought we'd have
barbecued Barbarian for brunch.

38:24.359 --> 38:27.278
[Voice Echoing On Speaker]
Testing. One, two, three.

38:43.259 --> 38:46.712
Hey, Sheriff, look.

38:46.806 --> 38:50.223
Five thousand?
It's on a 110 line.

38:50.311 --> 38:52.802
Packaging is everything, Sheriff.

39:00.866 --> 39:03.156
Here you go, B.A.
A.44 for ya.

39:03.245 --> 39:05.154
That still don't make us even, sucker.

39:05.247 --> 39:08.000
- Oh, come on, brother. Go easy on Face.
- I ain't your brother!

39:08.084 --> 39:10.161
Let's get him
in the church steeple.

39:10.254 --> 39:13.042
I just want you to know, you're
a welcome addition to my family.

39:13.133 --> 39:16.004
Oh, shut up and get out of here.
Keep pushin'.

39:16.095 --> 39:18.005
Push, push! Don't drop me!

39:22.437 --> 39:25.355
That's all we have. What are you
gonna do with this toilet paper?

39:25.441 --> 39:27.980
- Detour an access road.
- What?

39:28.070 --> 39:31.985
Sheriff, if you ignore the obvious,
you can get away with anything.

39:32.075 --> 39:35.196
- Not bad, huh?
- Hope it works.

39:35.288 --> 39:37.197
- It'll work.
- B.A.'s in church.

39:37.290 --> 39:40.542
And if you don't mind, Hannibal, sir,
I'd like to be up there with him.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.464
At a time like this,
one should be with his family.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.467
I understand, Captain,
but war is hell.

39:46.553 --> 39:49.887
- You'll have to stay
with the forward echelon.
- I understand, sir.

39:49.974 --> 39:52.644
Face, you and Murdock
put up that paper wall...

39:52.728 --> 39:55.564
then get a good field of fire
out of that joint there.

39:55.648 --> 39:58.223
- Murdock, you know where you start.
- Yes, sir.

40:14.173 --> 40:18.338
I sure hope this goes down
before the M.P. s arrive.

41:06.785 --> 41:09.990
Face, B.A.,
don't drop the hammers on 'em...

41:10.082 --> 41:13.915
till they"re close enough
you can spit on "em, okay?

41:19.219 --> 41:21.093
Here they come.

41:21.180 --> 41:24.930
Hey, Hannibal, here comes the meat.
They're hangin' a right on Main.

41:51.637 --> 41:56.846
We've come for our brother Sonny!
Let him out, or we take this town apart!

41:56.936 --> 41:59.428
You pigs want Jenko?

41:59.523 --> 42:03.688
Then climb off your tricycles
and come in and get him.

42:03.779 --> 42:06.449
You sound like you wanna die, pig.

42:06.532 --> 42:11.030
[Hannibal On Speaker]
Nah, I just wanna squeeze you
marshmallows outta my town.

42:11.122 --> 42:13.032
Now, come on.
l"m in here. Let"s go.

42:13.125 --> 42:17.455
Unless you muscle heads arejust
long on tough talk and short on guts.

42:17.547 --> 42:20.751
There's only two of you!
There are 30 of us!

42:20.843 --> 42:24.178
I don't think you got the gas
to keep Jenko in there!

42:24.264 --> 42:28.311
[Hannibal On Speaker]
Maybe. Maybe not. But there"s one
real easy way for you to find out.

42:28.395 --> 42:31.101
You want him, you got him.

42:31.190 --> 42:33.765
Let"s go!
First door on your right.

42:33.861 --> 42:37.278
And try not to drool on the rug.
Wejust had it cleaned.

42:37.365 --> 42:39.774
You're gonna eat it, Sheriff!

42:39.869 --> 42:42.621
And I'm gonna feed you
to the brothers for dessert!

42:42.706 --> 42:46.871
- [Hannibal On Speaker]
Remind me to tip the waitress.
- [Shouting]

42:46.962 --> 42:51.127
- They're leaving.
- Nah, just gettin' a running start.

42:58.352 --> 43:01.270
[Shouting, Hooting]

43:09.283 --> 43:10.908
Watch this.

43:27.057 --> 43:28.967
[Grunts]

43:29.060 --> 43:31.100
Okay, Murdock, you're on.

43:37.571 --> 43:40.194
[Clucking]

43:41.744 --> 43:45.659
Say, do any of you creeps
know the way to San Jose?

43:45.749 --> 43:49.285
[Clucking]
Catch me if you can!

43:49.379 --> 43:52.547
[Continues Clucking]

44:20.963 --> 44:24.131
[Face] Don"t anybody move a muscle!
Don"t even think about it!

44:31.978 --> 44:33.770
[Grunts]

44:59.848 --> 45:05.011
And the winner of the game
would holler...

45:06.774 --> 45:08.851
chicken!

45:08.944 --> 45:11.815
[Clucking]

45:15.912 --> 45:19.496
Welcome to Bad Rock, pal.

45:47.829 --> 45:51.959
- Thanks, Hannibal.
- No thanks. Just turn
your back for a second.

45:52.043 --> 45:54.962
What do you want me
to tell the military?

45:55.048 --> 45:57.753
Well, if you hear
from a guy named Lynch...

45:57.843 --> 46:00.928
tell him his mother
wears combat boots.

46:01.014 --> 46:02.972
See ya, Doc.

46:14.115 --> 46:17.699
Boy, is old Lynch gonna burn
after this one. He'll go cuckoo.

46:17.786 --> 46:21.121
Yeah. I hear there's a lot of that
goin' around. Right, brother?

46:21.208 --> 46:24.210
- I ain't your brother!
- Ah, come on, B.A. It worked, didn't it?

46:24.295 --> 46:27.001
Murdock's blood might even
add a little colour to your life.

46:27.091 --> 46:29.333
Don't need no colour.
Got enough already.

46:29.427 --> 46:32.133
Plus I owe you one.
Then we be even.
