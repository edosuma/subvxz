Lunesta...

08:18.454 --> 08:19.890
...Rozerem,

08:20.978 --> 08:23.459
Belsomra, Sonata.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.635
Um...

08:27.115 --> 08:28.377
Uh, Ambien.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.424
Edluar, Intermezzo.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.210
Uh, Benadryl.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.953
And then, um...

08:41.259 --> 08:43.044
stimulus control therapy...

08:44.654 --> 08:46.482
cognitive behavioral therapy,

08:47.744 --> 08:50.660
sleep hygiene,
relaxation training,

08:51.835 --> 08:53.054
and biofeedback.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.755
Anything else?Probably.

08:59.495 --> 09:03.847
And none of these
traditional forms of treatment
have proven effective?

09:04.021 --> 09:07.198
No, no. Um, that's
actually why I'm here.

09:07.372 --> 09:11.638
You know, what you described
in your intake forms,
a recurring dream,

09:11.812 --> 09:16.730
is not all that unusual
a phenomenon in and of itself.

09:16.904 --> 09:22.779
Well, I've had this dream
4,476 times.

09:25.303 --> 09:28.568
Yes, that part is a bit unusual.

09:32.963 --> 09:37.272
Have you ever encountered
a condition like mine?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.579
Well, most of my patients

09:39.753 --> 09:43.321
are suffering from more common
sleep disorders.

09:44.279 --> 09:48.675
Insomnia, parasomnia,
hypersomnias.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.242
Right.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.942
Most of my patients.

09:57.205 --> 10:00.687
To answer your question,
yes, I have treated a few people

10:00.861 --> 10:05.256
who were experiencing
symptoms like yours.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.914
How like mine?

10:12.524 --> 10:13.874
Very.

10:17.138 --> 10:21.055
There is a treatment
I have administered in the past,

10:21.229 --> 10:25.537
a form of hypnosis,
for lack of a better term,

10:25.712 --> 10:28.584
which greatly assisted
those others I mentioned

10:28.758 --> 10:32.109
who were suffering
from a similar defect.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.024
Defect?

10:34.198 --> 10:36.418
Sorry, poor choice of words.

10:36.592 --> 10:40.248
The treatment is very effective.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.773
It will eliminate
your recurring dream.

10:44.731 --> 10:48.169
You know that
other therapists before,
they said that they could help,

10:49.736 --> 10:52.042
but nothing ever changed.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.349
I will help you.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.134
The dream will go away.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.530
But...But?

11:03.358 --> 11:05.839
Unless we have
a thorough understanding

11:06.013 --> 11:08.319
of why you are having it,

11:08.493 --> 11:11.322
after some time has passed,

11:11.496 --> 11:13.107
the dream will come back.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.892
Okay, so how do we--
Like you said,

11:16.066 --> 11:18.199
I mean, how do we figure out
why I'm having it?

11:19.461 --> 11:22.290
Well, we start
by having you recount it for me

11:22.464 --> 11:25.206
in as much detail as possible.

11:27.338 --> 11:30.211
It, uh-- It takes place
in the house where I grew up.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.431
It can help sometimes
to close your eyes.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.789
Okay, so like I said,

11:42.963 --> 11:45.313
I'm in the house
where I grew up.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.489
I'm in the kitchen.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.579
My mom is there cooking dinner.

11:51.841 --> 11:55.323
She asks me
if I can run and ask my dad

11:55.497 --> 11:58.413
if he remembered to get garlic
when he went to the store.

11:58.587 --> 12:01.198
Sorry to interrupt.
Is this a memory?

12:01.372 --> 12:04.724
I don't really know. I, uh--

12:04.898 --> 12:08.379
Probably. I-I used to watch
my mom cook sometimes, but...

12:09.685 --> 12:12.601
Interesting. Go on.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.256
Uh, eyes open or closed?

12:16.431 --> 12:17.475
Up to you.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.696
Okay.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.525
Uh, so...

12:25.222 --> 12:28.704
then I run down the hallway...

12:28.878 --> 12:31.141
...to the bedroom...

12:31.315 --> 12:34.666
...and my dad is there
watching football on TV.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.199
And?

12:45.373 --> 12:46.417
And that's it. That's--

12:46.591 --> 12:47.941
That's where I wake up.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.862
It is extremely mundane.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.256
There is
one strange thing about it.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.563
What is it?

13:04.653 --> 13:07.264
It's this--
The thing is,

13:07.438 --> 13:09.919
before I get to the bedroom,
there-- there's...

13:12.356 --> 13:15.055
Hanging from the ceiling
is a red string.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.622
An attic?

13:19.146 --> 13:21.322
Yeah.Why is that strange?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.717
Because there was no attic
in the house where I grew up.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.895
You're certain of this?

13:30.679 --> 13:34.944
Yes.Could there have been one
and you were just unaware of it?

13:35.118 --> 13:38.513
I mean, I-I lived
in that house for 18 years.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.472
You know, I-I ran up and down
the hallway a thousand times.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.955
Uh, when I was 14 or so

13:46.129 --> 13:49.524
and the dream was driving me
fucking crazy,
I actually got a ladder

13:49.698 --> 13:53.571
and I took a hammer
to the ceiling
right in that spot.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.009
I just tore open the drywall,

13:56.183 --> 13:57.488
but I didn't find anything.

13:57.662 --> 14:02.015
Just insulation and wood.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.151
I see.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.245
So, um...

14:16.943 --> 14:18.553
that's why I'm here.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.864
Yes.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.388
It is.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.320
Here you go. Thank you.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.350
I'm sorry to bother you.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.614
My name is Harrison Hardy.
I'm moving in today.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.922
We spoke on the phone last week.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.402
Actually, I have
my security deposit here.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.929
I don't remember.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.671
Oh, yeah.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.588
I remember now. Ah. Hold on.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.331
Huh.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.726
Come with me.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.108
What-- I thought you said
it was furnished.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.414
Well, there's a bed,

16:21.676 --> 16:22.807
and a fridge,

16:24.113 --> 16:25.158
toilet.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.030
What you fucking want?
Martha Stewart?

16:28.204 --> 16:29.379
No, you're right. It's great.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.077
It's, uh--
It's perfect, actually.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.166
Um, where's the laundry room?

16:34.732 --> 16:35.907
Basement.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.997
Thanks.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.260
See ya!

16:41.217 --> 16:43.306
See ya.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.091
Oh.

16:47.136 --> 16:51.836
Did you hear or read anything

16:52.011 --> 16:54.274
about this building online?

16:56.276 --> 17:01.803
Um, just that it was cheap
and furnished.

17:51.722 --> 17:52.941
Mmm.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.292
Fuck that.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.316
Fuck that.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.043
Harrison, can you go
ask your dad

18:52.218 --> 18:53.480
if he remembered to get garlic

18:53.654 --> 18:55.134
when he went
to the grocery store?

19:29.864 --> 19:30.908
Okay.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.565
It is half past- 00.
I'm gonna move your clothes.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.307
That's it. I cannot wait
all day for this shit.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.751
Ten more minutes.
Ten more minutes.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.952
I mean, would I be pissed? No.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.217
But then I would come
get my clothes out
when they're done.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.567
What are you gonna do,
leave them in there all day?

20:20.741 --> 20:23.134
They're just gonna get
mildewy and gross.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.573
Yeah, all right. Yeah.
I'd totally understand.

20:27.443 --> 20:31.708
I would totally understand.
I'd get it. I'd love that. Okay.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.633
Is that my laundry?

20:43.807 --> 20:46.027
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I was just--

20:46.201 --> 20:47.289
I was gonna move
it to the dryer--

21:00.911 --> 21:02.173
Are you okay?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.526
Yeah, I-- Sorry. Um--

21:08.397 --> 21:09.746
I'm Maria.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.401
You must be Harrison Hardy.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.099
What?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.493
The new tenant in 429?

21:18.538 --> 21:19.800
Um, yeah.

21:20.714 --> 21:21.932
I'm in 630.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.370
Right above you, two floors up.

21:25.632 --> 21:29.288
May I?Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

21:32.856 --> 21:35.032
How are we liking
the Lafayette so far?

21:35.598 --> 21:37.644
Um... You know, it's, uh--

21:38.949 --> 21:40.864
it's a little strange,
to be honest.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.083
Hmm.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.305
So, where are you from, Harry?

21:47.523 --> 21:48.916
Uh, Riverside.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.439
Oh. Never been.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.573
Know anyone in the city?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.140
Well, I know you.

21:57.925 --> 22:02.625
Well, I'm very interested
to know how you ended up
at the Lafayette.

22:02.799 --> 22:07.804
Um, well, I just--
I was looking for a place
that was cheap and furnished.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.067
Well, I know what it's like
being new in town.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.548
You don't know anybody.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.463
Lonely, sad.

22:16.117 --> 22:19.729
Um, so, if you want to come up
to my place later,

22:19.903 --> 22:22.471
maybe have some dinner
and some drinks. I can...

22:24.081 --> 22:26.519
answer any questions
you have about this place.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.042
Oh, yeah. I mean--

22:29.348 --> 22:31.611
Yeah, that-- that--
that sounds great.
That'd be really nice.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.700
You eat meat?Yeah.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.354
Or unless you don't.
I don't have to.

22:35.528 --> 22:36.964
I love meat.

22:37.965 --> 22:38.966
I'll make steaks.

22:40.924 --> 22:41.969
Great.

22:51.761 --> 22:52.762
Good evening.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.331
Harry.Hey.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.378
Come in.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.300
Welcome to my place.
Would you like the tour?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.171
Sure.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.583
You like that, huh?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.151
It's been in my family
for generations.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.501
Really?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.504
Mm-hmm. No idea
who it is, though.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.114
Probably my great-aunt Marion.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.117
Interesting.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.033
Oh. Thanks.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.046
So why are you here?

24:44.308 --> 24:45.832
What-- You invited me over.

24:46.006 --> 24:49.226
At the Lafayette, I mean.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.054
Oh.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.492
Uh, well, I--
I just found it online.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.277
I just needed something
that was cheap and furnished.

24:57.191 --> 25:00.934
The Lafayette collects
unusual people.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.851
What?So what about you?

25:05.634 --> 25:08.637
What makes you unusual?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.553
Wow, you're--
you're just--

25:11.727 --> 25:13.947
you're, like,
really direct, you know.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.339
It's, um...

25:16.297 --> 25:18.342
I mean, we just--
we just met.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.648
Right.

25:21.345 --> 25:24.523
I mean, I-I just
don't really like to talk
about it with anybody.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.917
Okay, well, it's--

25:28.091 --> 25:29.745
Uh, I have a--

25:29.919 --> 25:32.269
I just have this,
like, sleep thing.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.358
Sleep thing?
What kind of sleep thing?

25:34.533 --> 25:38.319
Insomnia, sleepwalking,
night terrors, apnea,

25:38.493 --> 25:39.712
restless leg syndrome?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.757
Oh, no. It's just--
It's a dream.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.629
A dream?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.240
It's a-- It's a recurring dream.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.938
I've had it
about 5,000 times in my life.

25:49.112 --> 25:52.072
That seems like a lot.Yeah.

25:52.246 --> 25:54.509
I mean, I think so.
That's actually--

25:54.683 --> 25:56.163
That's why
I'm in the city currently.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.687
I'm-- I'm seeing
this new therapist.

25:58.861 --> 26:03.518
He's supposed to be like
one of the top, uh, som--
somnambulists in the world.

26:03.692 --> 26:06.739
Somnambulist?

26:06.913 --> 26:08.828
Sleep doctor. Yeah.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.047
What's the dream?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.876
It's really weird.
Uh...

26:15.051 --> 26:17.706
Uh, it's this thing
where I am...

26:19.099 --> 26:22.015
I'm-- I'm in the house
where I grew up and then I--
It's just--

26:23.059 --> 26:24.887
I-I run to ask my dad something

26:25.061 --> 26:27.237
and then on my way to--
to ask him, there's an--

26:27.411 --> 26:28.717
I see this attic out
of the corner of my eye,

26:28.891 --> 26:30.284
but there was no attic
in the house.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.373
It's fucking weird.
It doesn't make any sense.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.331
Ah, like the house
on Ash Tree Lane.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.726
What?So this therapist,

26:37.900 --> 26:41.077
he's gonna help you understand
why you keep having the dream?

26:41.687 --> 26:44.385
Help you figure out what's
in your nonexistent attic?

26:44.559 --> 26:48.781
Maybe. I mean, it's--
He said that he's helped
people like me before, so...

26:50.652 --> 26:52.349
Well, I wonder
if I could help you.

26:52.523 --> 26:56.658
Oh. I mean,
I really appreciate that,
but it's actually--

26:57.877 --> 26:59.835
It's one of those things
I've-- I've just, um--

27:00.967 --> 27:03.926
I've been struggling with it
for a long time.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.712
I mean, it's kind of...

27:08.583 --> 27:10.672
affected my entire life.

27:11.804 --> 27:15.459
Would you say that
understanding your dream

27:15.634 --> 27:19.725
is the thing you want
more than anything else
in the entire world?

27:25.992 --> 27:26.993
Sure.

27:29.604 --> 27:33.869
Maybe, or just
not having it anymore.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.697
Have you tried acid?

27:35.871 --> 27:37.264
What? No, why?

27:37.438 --> 27:38.744
You think that will help?

27:52.453 --> 27:55.456
Oh. I don't really smoke,
but thanks.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.069
Uh, do you mind
if I use your restroom?

28:02.550 --> 28:03.594
Thanks.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.100
Okay.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.335
You're really pretty.

29:34.555 --> 29:35.861
Like an actress or something.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.819
I am an actress.What, really?

29:37.993 --> 29:39.038
Mm-hmm.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.867
Have you been in anything
I might have seen?

29:43.216 --> 29:44.217
No.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.176
Cool.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.326
It's getting late.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.937
Oh, yeah. No, you're right.
I should, uh...

30:09.111 --> 30:10.243
I should probably get going.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.288
I didn't say you needed to go.

30:12.462 --> 30:13.855
Just making an observation.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.251
Okay.Yeah, you probably should.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.254
Yeah.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.693
I had a dream once.

30:26.999 --> 30:31.873
I was in a house on a beach
and I was lying in bed.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.313
And I was so sure,

30:38.358 --> 30:40.751
absolutely, completely sure,

30:41.927 --> 30:44.973
that out on the sand
outside this house

30:46.192 --> 30:47.715
was a black horse.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.548
I was so positive
there was a horse out there,

30:54.722 --> 30:57.290
even though there was no reason
for there to be a horse.

30:58.247 --> 31:02.599
And so in the dream,
I just couldn't take it anymore.

31:02.773 --> 31:07.213
I got out of bed
and I marched to the window

31:07.387 --> 31:09.693
and I looked out on the sand.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.741
And there was a horse?

31:16.309 --> 31:17.310
Cool.

31:20.617 --> 31:23.316
You can come over
tomorrow night if you want.

31:23.490 --> 31:26.362
Maybe I can help you figure out
what's in your dream attic.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.017
Okay.Okay.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.585
Good night!

32:01.484 --> 32:03.573
Harrison, can you go
ask your dad

32:03.747 --> 32:06.446
if he remembered
to get garlic when he went
to the grocery store?

34:01.517 --> 34:04.390
Hey, hey. Wait. Wait!

34:13.964 --> 34:15.662
Okay, so--

34:15.836 --> 34:17.098
I have some serious questions

34:17.272 --> 34:18.926
about this apartment complex.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.667
I bet you do.

34:20.841 --> 34:23.104
Okay, first of all, room 408.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.367
There's this weird sound
coming out of that room,

34:25.541 --> 34:27.021
so I actually
got closer to the--

34:27.195 --> 34:30.068
I touched the door.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.204
Jesus.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.684
I can't talk about 408.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.687
Okay, well-- Really?

34:42.210 --> 34:44.647
I don't-- Okay, well,
this morning I was, um--

34:44.821 --> 34:47.259
I--
I was up on the roof, uh...

34:47.433 --> 34:49.261
There was this girl.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.480
Charmagne.Yeah, she was, um--

34:51.654 --> 34:52.829
Singing?

34:54.048 --> 34:56.877
Yeah. She was really good too.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.401
But what was with the mask?

34:59.575 --> 35:01.882
Charmagne has
the most beautiful face.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.407
So much so that anyone
who looks at it, man or woman,

35:06.278 --> 35:10.630
they just fall
head over heels
in love with her.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.980
And so she wears the mask,

35:13.807 --> 35:16.331
so that people
don't fall in love
with her all the time.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.073
Maybe that's probably
for the best then, you know?

35:19.247 --> 35:21.423
Yeah.

35:21.597 --> 35:22.598
Um...

35:24.252 --> 35:26.036
Okay, last but not least--

35:26.211 --> 35:27.212
Mm-hmm.Last night...

35:29.388 --> 35:33.696
there was a guy floating...
in the lobby.

35:33.870 --> 35:34.915
Elliot.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.614
Yeah, so, like, what's--
what's his story?

35:39.267 --> 35:40.486
He floats.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.054
I have to pee.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.974
He floats.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.431
Hey, you know, there's a--

36:12.605 --> 36:16.130
there's a book
in the middle of your floor.
Might want to move it.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.872
It's kind of a hazard,
don't you think?
Someone could trip on it.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.526
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.Huh?

36:22.397 --> 36:25.444
A very powerful wizard
used to live here before me.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.622
And when he left,
he left this book.

36:29.796 --> 36:30.753
And he told me

36:32.059 --> 36:34.714
if anyone were to read
even one line from it,

36:35.628 --> 36:37.282
they'd drop dead on the spot.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.242
And you
really believe that?

36:42.809 --> 36:43.810
Didn't you hear me?

36:45.159 --> 36:49.816
I said, a very powerful wizard.

36:52.035 --> 36:54.299
Uh, I don't know.

36:55.735 --> 36:59.129
I've heard you can have
kind of a crazy reaction to it,

36:59.304 --> 37:02.394
you know, like lose your mind
or something so...

37:02.568 --> 37:03.569
Open.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.356
Okay.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.019
Open.

37:21.891 --> 37:26.244
Harry, don't you know I'd never
let anything bad happen to you?

37:45.001 --> 37:48.788
Harrison, can you go
ask your dad

37:48.962 --> 37:51.791
if he remembered
to get garlic when he went
to the grocery store?

38:42.494 --> 38:43.669
I can just wait
for the next one.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.411
No. There is no next one.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.200
You spend the night
with Maria last night?

38:53.374 --> 38:54.897
How did you--

38:55.071 --> 38:58.118
Her smell is on you.
All over you.

39:00.773 --> 39:01.774
Hmm.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.171
Uh...

39:09.303 --> 39:10.348
So...

39:12.611 --> 39:15.091
But, um, yeah, it was-- it was
really good talking to you, man.

39:16.005 --> 39:19.313
Yeah. You too.So, I'll just
catch you later.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.055
Oh, you're-- Yeah, well--

39:24.840 --> 39:25.841
Okay.

39:31.760 --> 39:35.808
So, this is what the units
on this side of the building
look like.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.202
Uh, yeah. Yup.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.556
Sorry, I don't have
any beer or anything.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.608
Hey.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.916
I work
at the nature center downtown.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.397
You ever been?Uh...

39:59.571 --> 40:02.138
N-No.Caretaker there.

40:02.748 --> 40:06.360
I look after
the Arakan forest turtles.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.232
Oh. Sweet. Nice.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.060
Ever heard of 'em?

40:11.887 --> 40:14.324
Uh, no, I can't say
I have, actually.

40:14.499 --> 40:17.415
That's because they're one
of the most endangered species
on the planet.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.853
Oh. Well, then how many
do you guys have
at the nature center?

40:21.027 --> 40:22.637
Two.Oh.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.987
Guess how many are left
in the entire world.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.947
Um...

40:28.121 --> 40:29.209
Two.Oh.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.690
The last two.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.213
Wow, that's--

40:34.736 --> 40:37.043
That's really sad.
I mean, you know,
that they're almost ex--

40:37.217 --> 40:38.218
Don't say that.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.569
Come on. Be positive, man.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.964
Yeah. All right.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.445
But yeah.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.752
It's pretty goddamn sad.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.756
The two that we have
are male and female,

40:55.540 --> 40:57.498
the actual last
of their species.

40:59.282 --> 41:00.458
So as you can imagine,

41:01.981 --> 41:04.374
the most important
aspect of my job

41:04.549 --> 41:06.202
is trying to convince them
to breed.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.207
You know how stressful that is?

41:12.121 --> 41:14.210
I got a lot of problems
in my life, you know?

41:15.429 --> 41:20.042
Girls, money, health.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.393
It's easy to just leave my job
at work and forget about it.

41:24.656 --> 41:25.874
But then I think,

41:26.658 --> 41:28.355
"The continued existence

41:28.529 --> 41:31.532
of an animal that's been
living on this planet

41:31.706 --> 41:35.014
for tens of thousands of years

41:36.406 --> 41:38.278
is my sole responsibility.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.978
What are my problems
compared to that?"

41:47.156 --> 41:49.507
I have to get
those two turtles to fuck.

41:51.334 --> 41:53.249
It's the most important thing
in the world.

41:56.209 --> 41:57.384
Do they not want to?

42:00.082 --> 42:01.606
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

42:02.781 --> 42:05.523
I can't exactly ask them.
They're turtles.

42:05.697 --> 42:08.700
Right, I'm just wondering
if they seem, um--

42:09.962 --> 42:11.180
interested in each other.

42:14.793 --> 42:15.837
I do everything I can

42:16.011 --> 42:17.491
to make their surroundings

42:17.665 --> 42:18.840
as comfortable as possible.

42:19.928 --> 42:24.019
I put a little bed
in their tank, you know?

42:25.891 --> 42:27.196
I put leaves on it.

42:30.069 --> 42:32.593
I tried playing
sexy music for 'em, even.

42:43.822 --> 42:45.388
Does any of that work?

42:47.869 --> 42:48.870
Hasn't yet.

42:51.090 --> 42:52.091
Shit.

42:53.962 --> 42:55.921
I really hope
that works out.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.142
You hope that it works out?

43:02.014 --> 43:03.319
Yeah.

43:03.493 --> 43:06.235
You hope that this species

43:06.409 --> 43:08.063
continues to exist
on this planet?

43:09.151 --> 43:10.326
How kind of you.

43:14.026 --> 43:15.810
Next time things
are going bad for you,

43:17.116 --> 43:20.685
and you have some big problem
that's so important...

43:25.472 --> 43:26.952
remember those turtles.

43:30.433 --> 43:31.478
Okay.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.617
The dream changed.

43:39.791 --> 43:41.096
Just--

43:41.270 --> 43:42.402
Just a tiny, tiny bit.

43:42.576 --> 43:43.925
I, uh-- I--

43:45.492 --> 43:47.581
I glanced up at the string.

43:49.322 --> 43:51.541
Directly at it. And that was it.

43:52.281 --> 43:55.720
And this was
right after your evening with--

43:55.894 --> 43:57.591
What was her name?Maria.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.595
I see.What do you think happened?

44:02.465 --> 44:06.905
I don't... know for certain.

44:07.079 --> 44:08.994
Your condition is very rare.

44:09.168 --> 44:10.778
Condition? What?

44:12.171 --> 44:18.307
Well, you're experiencing
the... dream symptom.

44:20.788 --> 44:21.920
Very...

44:23.791 --> 44:25.140
serious...

44:27.665 --> 44:28.970
illness.

44:29.144 --> 44:30.189
It is?

44:30.363 --> 44:32.104
Yes. And it...

44:38.545 --> 44:41.287
I'm surprised
it didn't occur to me earlier.

44:42.941 --> 44:43.942
What?

44:44.594 --> 44:46.205
Your whore friend Maria.

44:46.379 --> 44:48.555
What? What?

44:50.426 --> 44:52.428
What did you say?
What did you just say?

44:52.602 --> 44:53.691
What-- What's wrong?

44:53.865 --> 44:55.170
It sounded like you--

44:55.344 --> 44:57.259
Did you just call Maria a whore?

44:57.433 --> 45:00.132
No, of course not. Why on earth
would I have done that?

45:00.306 --> 45:03.526
I said, "Your friend Maria."

45:08.793 --> 45:10.142
What about her?

45:14.886 --> 45:15.887
Nothing.

45:18.019 --> 45:19.064
Nothing.

45:19.238 --> 45:21.980
It's just curious that...

45:25.418 --> 45:26.941
that you would meet her now.

45:28.813 --> 45:30.423
The timing of it all.

45:32.947 --> 45:35.776
No matter. I think
that on your next visit,

45:36.690 --> 45:39.998
we should start the treatment.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.303
I think you're ready.

45:43.175 --> 45:44.437
The hypnosis?

45:48.310 --> 45:49.747
Okay. Um...

45:50.443 --> 45:52.924
You said you wanted
to understand the dream better

45:53.098 --> 45:54.099
before we did that.

45:55.230 --> 45:56.971
I think I do now.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.764
One sec.

46:07.590 --> 46:09.114
Coming!

46:11.029 --> 46:12.508
Coming, coming, coming, coming.

46:15.337 --> 46:17.165
Hey!Aw!

46:17.992 --> 46:20.995
Cute place.Thanks. Uh, I haven't
really had a chance--

46:21.169 --> 46:23.650
Have I told you
about my friends
Lauren and Oliver?

46:23.824 --> 46:25.478
They live in 201.Uh...

46:25.652 --> 46:27.001
No, I don't think so.Lauren's my best friend

46:27.175 --> 46:28.568
and Oliver, well...

46:28.742 --> 46:30.526
Oliver's a fucking prick.Yeah.

46:30.700 --> 46:33.138
You'll meet them soon.
Lauren works for Rory Calhoun.

46:33.312 --> 46:36.184
You obviously know
who that is.No, I don't, actually.

46:36.358 --> 46:38.970
Oliver just loves the theater.
I mean, you wouldn't expect it.

46:39.144 --> 46:41.755
So last month
they came to see me
at the center in Ruston.

46:41.929 --> 46:43.148
It was Cymbeline...

46:44.932 --> 46:46.238
but with lesbians.

46:47.195 --> 46:50.329
Which,
now that I think about it,
is kind of ironic.

46:50.503 --> 46:53.767
Anyway, they brought Rory,
and I guess

46:53.941 --> 46:56.857
Rory liked my performance
and was super impressed with me.

46:57.031 --> 46:59.555
So he wanted me to send him
something of me on tape,

46:59.729 --> 47:02.297
because he thinks
I might be right
for a role in his upcoming film.

47:02.471 --> 47:05.083
I mean,
can you believe that?Oh, wow.

47:05.257 --> 47:06.736
That's amazing.He's interested.

47:06.911 --> 47:08.173
That's so cool.In me.

47:08.347 --> 47:10.566
I'm sorry,
but I don't know
who he is.

47:10.740 --> 47:14.222
This is the most important thing

47:14.396 --> 47:17.225
that has ever happened to me
in my entire life.

47:20.228 --> 47:21.621
Do you want me
to help make the video?

47:21.795 --> 47:23.753
Yes, I want you to help operate.

47:23.928 --> 47:24.972
Okay.

47:25.712 --> 47:27.322
Okay, I don't really know
how to do this.

47:27.496 --> 47:30.891
Yeah, you press record,
and then you press stop.

47:31.065 --> 47:34.503
And, uh, say "action."

47:34.677 --> 47:36.766
Okay.Okay. Okay.

47:36.941 --> 47:38.420
Wait.

47:40.814 --> 47:44.731
One second.How's it look?

47:44.905 --> 47:46.341
Yeah, it look-- it looks great.

47:48.430 --> 47:49.431
Are you ready?

47:56.308 --> 47:57.526
And action!

48:06.187 --> 48:08.059
I was continuing to shrink.

48:12.672 --> 48:15.980
To become... what?

48:17.372 --> 48:18.808
The infinitesimal?

48:21.333 --> 48:22.464
What was I?

48:26.381 --> 48:27.905
Still a human being.

48:30.429 --> 48:32.474
Or was I a man of the future?

48:33.649 --> 48:35.086
In that moment, I knew

48:36.652 --> 48:40.874
the answer to the riddle
of the infinite.

48:41.875 --> 48:43.311
You see, I had thought

48:43.485 --> 48:46.184
in terms of man's own
limited dimension.

48:46.358 --> 48:49.796
I had presumed
upon nature.

48:49.970 --> 48:51.929
That existence begins and ends

48:52.103 --> 48:55.933
is man's conception,
not nature's.

48:58.457 --> 49:00.415
And I felt my body dwindling.

49:02.983 --> 49:03.984
Melting.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.901
Becoming nothing.

49:10.469 --> 49:12.384
My fears melted away.

49:13.820 --> 49:15.865
And in their place
came acceptance.

49:17.780 --> 49:21.523
All this vast majesty
of creation.

49:22.916 --> 49:25.092
Surely, it had
to mean something.

49:26.746 --> 49:28.443
And then I meant something too.

49:29.444 --> 49:34.580
Yes. Smaller than the small,
I meant something too.

49:47.114 --> 49:48.159
Say "cut."

49:48.811 --> 49:49.769
Oh, cut.

49:49.943 --> 49:53.512
Hmm. Oh. How was that?

49:56.732 --> 49:58.517
I don't know what to say.

49:58.691 --> 50:01.694
No-- I think it was perfect.

50:02.521 --> 50:04.001
Really?Yeah.

50:04.175 --> 50:06.829
Okay, well, if I need
to do another take,

50:07.004 --> 50:09.484
I know where
to find you. I'll be here.

50:09.658 --> 50:12.009
Now I have to go get ready
for my party tonight.

50:12.183 --> 50:15.055
Oh, my God. I didn't tell you
I'm having a party tonight, huh?

50:15.229 --> 50:16.752
Um, no, I don't think so.

50:18.580 --> 50:21.279
Would you like to come
to my party tonight?
I would be honored.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.585
Yeah, sure.Ah! Great.

50:23.759 --> 50:25.196
What time?We're gonna have so much fun.

50:25.370 --> 50:27.415
Now that I have this done,
I feel better.

50:27.589 --> 50:28.764
What time?

50:34.379 --> 50:37.295
Oh! Maria, you--
you left your shoes.

51:06.976 --> 51:09.370
Simone, darling.

51:10.328 --> 51:11.242
Hi.Hey.

51:11.416 --> 51:12.417
Thank you for coming.

51:12.591 --> 51:13.766
Yeah, this is great.Oh!

51:14.941 --> 51:17.552
Have you gotten a drink yet?Uh, no, not yet.

51:17.726 --> 51:19.293
Remember I told you
about Lauren and Oliver?

51:19.467 --> 51:21.252
Yeah.They're here.
Do you want to meet them?

51:21.426 --> 51:22.688
Sure.Come on.

51:24.690 --> 51:25.908
She told me
she was gonna be here.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.606
Lauren?

51:27.780 --> 51:29.521
Hello, gorgeous.Hi.

51:31.392 --> 51:33.351
Will Oliver be joining us?

51:33.525 --> 51:36.005
Yeah, 20 minutes
or so, I reckon.Oh, soon.

51:36.180 --> 51:38.660
Yeah.
I hear him whispering already.

51:40.401 --> 51:42.099
This is Harrison Hardy.

51:42.273 --> 51:44.753
The new tenant in 429.Mm-hmm.

51:44.927 --> 51:46.581
The one with the sleep thing.

51:47.713 --> 51:49.976
And this is Lauren Reitz.

51:50.150 --> 51:51.499
And this is Oliver Black.

51:51.673 --> 51:53.414
It is so nice
to meet you, Harrison.

51:53.588 --> 51:55.416
Maria's told me
such great things.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.203
Uh, I'm sorry,
Lauren Reitz and, uh...

51:59.377 --> 52:00.465
What was it?

52:00.639 --> 52:02.423
Oliver.Oliver.

52:04.338 --> 52:07.385
Lauren shares her body
with a 55-year-old British man
named Oliver Black.

52:07.559 --> 52:09.735
Fifty-six.
His birthday was last week.

52:09.909 --> 52:12.520
A Gemini?Yeah.

52:12.694 --> 52:15.828
Well, then it's very nice
to meet the two of you, I guess.

52:16.002 --> 52:18.047
I'm gonna get you a drink.
What do you want? A cocktail?

52:18.222 --> 52:20.659
Um-- Just a beer is fine.

52:20.833 --> 52:22.530
Sure.Thank you.

52:23.531 --> 52:24.837
Just a bit of advice.

52:25.011 --> 52:26.839
I wouldn't let them
get your drink.

52:27.013 --> 52:30.408
Lauren is trustworthy,
but Oliver will roofie you.

52:31.757 --> 52:34.934
And I'd be careful what I say
about one to the other.

52:35.108 --> 52:37.328
Because I'm not entirely sure
what they can and can't hear.

52:37.502 --> 52:39.634
If you know what I mean.I...

52:40.331 --> 52:41.636
Isn't she cute?

52:42.985 --> 52:45.118
Here you go.Thank you.

52:46.902 --> 52:49.601
So, welcome to Lafayette.

52:49.775 --> 52:50.689
Settling in?

52:50.863 --> 52:52.691
Um-- Kind of, yeah.

52:52.865 --> 52:55.955
Tell me about this dream thing.
Sounds interesting.

52:56.129 --> 52:59.306
You know, I'd really rather not.
It's-- It's pretty embarrassing.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.396
Come on. We're all
a little embarrassing here.

53:04.006 --> 53:05.791
Yeah, she's always trying
to set me up with guys.

53:05.965 --> 53:09.751
I appreciate it, you know,
but tell her she's got to stop.

53:09.925 --> 53:13.929
And I know she means well,
but I'm a fucking lot to handle.

53:14.103 --> 53:16.367
Oh, no. You seem great.

53:17.455 --> 53:19.631
That's really sweet
of you to say.

53:19.805 --> 53:22.503
But you haven't met him.

53:24.026 --> 53:28.596
Tell me, though, if I wasn't
possessed by an old British man,

53:28.770 --> 53:29.989
would you be attracted to me?

53:30.555 --> 53:33.384
I-- You're very pretty.

53:35.081 --> 53:37.431
I try to look
on the bright side, you know?

53:37.605 --> 53:39.781
At least I only have
one interloper.

53:39.955 --> 53:41.914
I mean, I could be
like Truddi Chase.

53:45.265 --> 53:47.746
He is the interloper,
though, right?

53:48.312 --> 53:51.097
What does this body
look like to you?

53:51.271 --> 53:54.100
Uh, what? Uh, it--

53:54.274 --> 53:55.928
You look like a young woman.

53:56.102 --> 53:58.060
A beautiful young woman?

53:58.235 --> 54:00.106
Um, I'd say so, yes.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.718
There you go.

54:06.243 --> 54:11.335
He does like
to watch me have sex.

54:12.074 --> 54:13.772
It makes it
really hard to focus.

54:14.425 --> 54:18.124
Uh, hmm. Hmm.

54:18.298 --> 54:22.607
I'm gonna go get another.
You want one?I'm good here. Thank you.

54:35.533 --> 54:36.621
Pardon me.

54:38.492 --> 54:41.321
Have you seen my sister?
I can't seem
to find her anywhere.

54:43.192 --> 54:45.717
Hmm. No, I'm--
I'm sorry. I can't.

54:45.891 --> 54:47.327
I don't know
where your sister is.

55:01.689 --> 55:03.778
Look at this.Hey!

55:06.128 --> 55:07.782
Oh, fuck.

55:10.916 --> 55:14.223
You smoking inside?Fuck is it to you?

55:15.355 --> 55:20.404
Oh! If it ain't the prick
who's scheming to get
into little Lauren's knickers.

55:22.188 --> 55:24.669
Let me save you
the fucking sweet talk.

55:25.887 --> 55:28.150
A slam dunk. Come on.
Take a sniff, sniff, sniff.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.630
Stop, don't do that.
Don't. Come on.

55:29.804 --> 55:32.546
Wow, you must be Oliver.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.287
And you must be
"who gives a fuck?"

55:35.244 --> 55:37.116
Okay, so when--
when you're here,

55:37.290 --> 55:39.336
Lauren is
completely unavailable?

55:43.383 --> 55:45.690
What do you care?

55:46.343 --> 55:49.433
I-- I just enjoy
talking to her.
She seems nice.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.783
She's a cunt just like you.Okay.

55:51.957 --> 55:53.698
Well, she seems nice.

55:53.872 --> 55:55.874
Oh, yeah, you'd know
better than me, wouldn't you?

55:56.048 --> 55:57.615
What, you've known her
30 minutes?

55:57.789 --> 56:00.226
And I've lived
inside her for 30 years.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.141
Oh, you've been
inside her that long?

56:04.752 --> 56:07.668
Got another fag, fag?

56:09.757 --> 56:11.846
It must be really hard.Yeah, of course it's hard.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.980
What, you think
I like giving blow jobs
and being buggered?

56:15.154 --> 56:17.286
What, I look
like a fucking homo to you?

56:17.939 --> 56:21.116
What I want to do
is shove my cock

56:21.290 --> 56:24.076
up her friend Maria's arse
and make her scream.Okay.

56:24.250 --> 56:28.080
But guess what?
I ain't got no cock.

56:28.254 --> 56:31.083
What about you?
You aren't horny?Stop! Come on, knock it off.

56:31.257 --> 56:32.954
Jesus.

56:35.740 --> 56:38.177
Where have I seen you before?

56:38.351 --> 56:40.048
You say you've never been
to Sussex?

56:40.222 --> 56:41.920
No. Can't say I have.

56:42.094 --> 56:44.879
Oh, that's right.
It was a photograph.

56:45.053 --> 56:48.230
I'll never forget a face
as ugly as yours.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.276
If Lauren finds you attractive,

56:50.450 --> 56:51.625
she's even dumber
than I thought.

56:51.799 --> 56:53.279
Wait, did you say photograph?

56:55.324 --> 56:58.371
Yeah. Mutual acquaintance
showed it to me.

56:59.807 --> 57:02.070
Who?I ain't saying.

57:03.768 --> 57:05.987
She might be listening.

57:34.059 --> 57:36.888
Maria. Hey.

57:44.330 --> 57:45.462
Leave me alone.

57:51.990 --> 57:53.731
It's you.

57:54.645 --> 57:55.950
I'm sorry

57:57.474 --> 57:59.606
you didn't find me sooner.

58:12.445 --> 58:14.926
Mmm. So, how are the turtles?

58:16.797 --> 58:17.885
Still virgins.

58:18.799 --> 58:19.887
Fuck.

58:20.758 --> 58:22.542
That sucks, man.

58:22.716 --> 58:23.848
It does.

58:29.288 --> 58:31.116
You know what's
total fucking bullshit?

58:32.900 --> 58:33.901
What's that?

58:34.815 --> 58:35.816
Everything.

58:40.255 --> 58:43.171
I'm serious.
Like, what the fuck
are we doing here?

58:43.345 --> 58:46.784
You know,
we're on this planet,
what, 80 years?

58:47.611 --> 58:49.395
And that's it?
Like, what is that?

58:51.092 --> 58:52.746
It's fucking nothing.
I mean,

58:52.920 --> 58:54.922
in the grand scheme
of the whole universe,

58:55.096 --> 58:56.097
you know what that is?

58:57.925 --> 59:00.754
That is a goddamn
fart in the wind.

59:02.843 --> 59:05.280
You know what?
Actually, it's not
even a fart. We're--

59:05.454 --> 59:07.500
It-- It's
a shadow of a fart.

59:07.674 --> 59:11.548
You and I are shadows
of a fucking fart
in the wind.

59:13.637 --> 59:15.377
It's not enough time, you know?

59:16.683 --> 59:18.032
I don't wanna die.

59:20.121 --> 59:23.429
I wanna live forever.
I mean, I like myself, David.

59:23.603 --> 59:26.084
I don't wanna know myself
for just a shadow-fart span.

59:26.258 --> 59:27.651
It's not enough, you know?

59:33.657 --> 59:37.138
I like me.
I like who I am.

59:39.227 --> 59:40.446
I don't wanna die.

59:44.668 --> 59:46.060
Just everything...

59:47.758 --> 59:49.934
everything we are...

59:52.893 --> 59:54.547
everything we own...

59:56.593 --> 1:00:00.118
these-- these bodies,
our memories...

1:00:02.337 --> 1:00:05.776
everyone we know,
all goes away in the end.

1:00:07.865 --> 1:00:09.693
And we're just--What?

1:00:11.564 --> 1:00:13.610
Yeah, exactly.Man...

1:00:15.524 --> 1:00:18.136
you got some dark thoughts
inside that head.

1:00:19.659 --> 1:00:20.660
Yeah.

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:31.453
Excuse me, Rory.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:33.586
There's some people here
to see you.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:37.111
Who are they?

1:00:37.285 --> 1:00:39.374
I thought I had no meetings
this afternoon.

1:00:39.548 --> 1:00:41.725
You know I've been working
on that counteroffer.

1:00:41.899 --> 1:00:43.944
'm sorry.
They're on their way.Wow, what?

1:00:44.118 --> 1:00:45.946
Hey, no.

1:00:52.213 --> 1:00:53.214
Shit.

1:01:05.618 --> 1:01:06.967
Hello, Rory.

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:17.804
The arrangements we made
previously seem suitable.

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:21.460
Mm-hmm.

1:01:24.028 --> 1:01:27.466
I require your assistance
in a new matter.

1:01:28.946 --> 1:01:33.951
Nothing too strenuous,
I assure you.

1:01:38.042 --> 1:01:39.086
You promised me.

1:01:45.353 --> 1:01:47.834
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:51.795
Nothing.

1:01:52.621 --> 1:01:53.666
Right.

1:01:55.276 --> 1:01:57.583
I require your assistance
in a new matter.

1:01:57.757 --> 1:02:00.499
Nothing too strenuous,
I assure you.

1:02:00.673 --> 1:02:03.241
Just a simple procurement.

1:02:03.415 --> 1:02:06.157
Your involvement
will be minimal.

1:02:09.247 --> 1:02:10.248
Listen...

1:02:12.206 --> 1:02:15.601
I know what our arrangement is.

1:02:15.775 --> 1:02:18.256
But you told me
I fulfilled my obligation.

1:02:18.430 --> 1:02:23.652
You had, but this
current development
was... unexpected.

1:02:29.615 --> 1:02:33.053
I still have fucking nightmares
about the last time.

1:02:33.227 --> 1:02:34.228
I know.

1:02:38.232 --> 1:02:40.191
So you can't just-- just, uh...

1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:43.629
come in here
and ask me to help you.

1:02:44.630 --> 1:02:46.284
Again, I'm...

1:02:47.894 --> 1:02:49.461
I'm really busy. I'm busy.

1:02:49.635 --> 1:02:51.985
And I-I have been working
on this counteroffer.

1:02:52.159 --> 1:02:56.598
I understand.
I do, however,
have one question.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:04.781
Where am I?

1:03:07.958 --> 1:03:09.307
Who the fuck are you?

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:13.006
Tell me, Rory...

1:03:15.748 --> 1:03:18.664
do you enjoy existing?

1:04:20.639 --> 1:04:22.641
Hey.

1:04:22.815 --> 1:04:23.947
Hey!

1:04:24.121 --> 1:04:25.687
You look amazing.

1:04:26.819 --> 1:04:29.343
Really? I'm so nervous.

1:04:29.517 --> 1:04:31.911
Don't be. Rory's a sweetheart.
You're gonna love him.

1:04:32.085 --> 1:04:33.130
I hope he likes me.

1:04:33.304 --> 1:04:34.522
Come on.Okay.

1:05:04.944 --> 1:05:05.945
Yeah.

1:05:07.512 --> 1:05:11.472
Get me someone. Anyone.

1:05:13.170 --> 1:05:14.171
Hey, Maria.

1:06:22.587 --> 1:06:24.502
Come on.

1:07:32.091 --> 1:07:33.310
Help me.

1:07:36.965 --> 1:07:38.097
Hello?

1:07:40.621 --> 1:07:42.058
Help me. Help me.

1:07:44.190 --> 1:07:45.452
Hello?

1:07:46.845 --> 1:07:47.889
Help me.

1:07:58.639 --> 1:08:01.294
Help me, help me,
help me, help me...

1:08:08.214 --> 1:08:11.217
Help me, help me,
help me, help me...

1:08:32.717 --> 1:08:34.719
Hello?
Help me.

1:08:38.375 --> 1:08:39.680
Hel-- Help me.

1:08:39.854 --> 1:08:40.899
Hello?

1:08:54.304 --> 1:08:56.175
911, what's your emergency? Hi, um--

1:08:56.349 --> 1:08:58.046
actually I don't know
if it's an emergency,

1:08:58.221 --> 1:08:59.657
but I just got a call
from a friend

1:08:59.831 --> 1:09:01.833
and I think she might be
in some kind of danger.

1:09:02.007 --> 1:09:04.357
Please hold. Oh-- Yeah. Okay.

1:09:09.971 --> 1:09:11.059
Help me.

1:09:13.714 --> 1:09:16.500
H-Hello? Harry, help me.

1:09:17.936 --> 1:09:18.980
Hello?

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:43.266
Rory Calhoun's office.

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:44.832
How can I help you? Shit.

1:09:48.836 --> 1:09:51.361
Rory Calhoun.

1:09:55.408 --> 1:09:56.540
Oh, my God.

1:10:02.415 --> 1:10:04.374
Okay, okay, okay...

1:10:04.548 --> 1:10:06.071
Rory Calhoun's office.

1:10:08.943 --> 1:10:11.207
Hello? Yeah. Hello.

1:10:11.381 --> 1:10:12.512
How can I help you?

1:10:13.948 --> 1:10:17.778
Um, I actually got
a strange call from this number.

1:10:19.476 --> 1:10:20.738
Who am I speaking with?

1:10:22.696 --> 1:10:24.176
Who am I speaking with?

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.918
Please hold. No, wait, wait, wait.

1:10:30.965 --> 1:10:32.967
Sorry for the wait.
I've got Mr. Calhoun
for you now.

1:10:33.141 --> 1:10:36.014
Wait, what? No, no, no.
No. Please don't.

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:40.627
Help me.

1:10:45.676 --> 1:10:46.677
Maria?

1:10:47.634 --> 1:10:49.680
Harry, help me.

1:10:50.898 --> 1:10:52.509
Maria, is-- is that you?

1:10:54.728 --> 1:10:55.729
Hello?

1:10:58.645 --> 1:11:02.170
Hello, Harrison.
Good to see you.Hi. Um...

1:11:02.345 --> 1:11:04.521
Something really strange
is going on.
I don't know, uh...

1:11:04.695 --> 1:11:07.393
Something like--
Maria might be
in some sort of trouble.

1:11:07.567 --> 1:11:08.612
How so?

1:11:09.482 --> 1:11:11.571
I don't-- I don't know.
Never mind. It's--

1:11:11.745 --> 1:11:14.095
We're supposed to do the--
the hypnosis today?

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.967
We are.Okay.

1:11:16.141 --> 1:11:17.621
Well, I should tell you then,

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:21.277
the dream,
it continued to expand.

1:11:22.016 --> 1:11:26.020
This time I-I--
I pulled down the string,

1:11:26.934 --> 1:11:29.807
I climbed up the ladder
and I actually peeked
into the attic.

1:11:31.156 --> 1:11:35.203
I-I... see, and wh--

1:11:39.077 --> 1:11:41.514
What was in there?Photographs.

1:11:42.123 --> 1:11:46.302
Boxes of them, like these--
you know, those old-style
Polaroid photos?

1:11:47.085 --> 1:11:48.391
There were just stacks of them.

1:11:49.566 --> 1:11:52.482
And did you look at any of them?

1:11:54.092 --> 1:11:57.356
Yeah. Uh, there-- there were
pictures of people, uh...

1:11:57.530 --> 1:12:00.751
Some...
Some of them I recognized,

1:12:02.013 --> 1:12:03.362
but mostly strangers.

1:12:04.145 --> 1:12:05.190
I see.

1:12:05.973 --> 1:12:08.976
Well, I think we should begin
with this treatment.

1:12:09.150 --> 1:12:10.151
Are you ready?

1:12:10.761 --> 1:12:12.240
Sure.Close your eyes.

1:12:13.851 --> 1:12:17.202
What I am going to do now
is give you a riddle.

1:12:17.376 --> 1:12:21.772
It will only take a moment
and when I'm finished,

1:12:21.946 --> 1:12:25.341
you will undergo a change.

1:12:27.081 --> 1:12:29.736
But you must pay
very close attention

1:12:30.607 --> 1:12:34.132
and do not interrupt me
once I start.

1:12:35.481 --> 1:12:37.483
Do you understand?

1:12:39.659 --> 1:12:41.705
Yes, but, uh, before we start,

1:12:43.750 --> 1:12:45.273
what did you mean the other day

1:12:46.274 --> 1:12:48.755
when you said it was curious
that I met her now?

1:12:50.496 --> 1:12:52.498
I'm not sure I understand.

1:12:52.672 --> 1:12:54.631
You said it was curious
that I met Maria now.

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:56.633
The timing of it all.

1:12:58.156 --> 1:13:02.203
Let's discuss that further
after we've begun the hypnosis.

1:13:03.204 --> 1:13:04.249
Okay.

1:13:08.688 --> 1:13:10.429
And you definitely
didn't call her a whore?

1:13:10.603 --> 1:13:12.605
I definitely did not.

1:13:13.345 --> 1:13:15.565
She's quite pleasant, I'm sure.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:20.961
Okay.

1:13:24.312 --> 1:13:25.966
Three brothers are traveling

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:27.881
and stop at an inn one night

1:13:28.752 --> 1:13:30.188
and ask for a room.

1:13:32.712 --> 1:13:34.671
The cost of the room is--

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:38.892
Is--That scared
the fuck out of me.

1:13:39.066 --> 1:13:41.329
I am so sorry.

1:13:41.504 --> 1:13:44.811
It's fine.I swore I turned
that fucking ringer off.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:55.822
I have no idea what that was.

1:13:55.996 --> 1:13:56.997
Let's begin.

1:14:04.614 --> 1:14:08.139
Three brothers are traveling
and stop at an inn one night,

1:14:08.313 --> 1:14:10.141
and ask for a room.

1:14:12.099 --> 1:14:16.364
The cost of the room
is 30 gold pieces.

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:20.020
Each brother pays
ten gold pieces.

1:14:24.329 --> 1:14:25.461
I thought you said
you turned it off.

1:14:26.636 --> 1:14:29.029
I did.

1:14:33.164 --> 1:14:35.775
I did. Clearly, it's--

1:14:35.949 --> 1:14:37.560
It must be
malfunctioning.

1:14:37.734 --> 1:14:40.084
I'll have Cindy
buy a new one.Answer it.

1:14:42.042 --> 1:14:44.044
Excuse me?Pick it up.

1:14:44.218 --> 1:14:46.917
It-- It's unplugged.

1:14:47.091 --> 1:14:48.396
Clearly, it's broken.

1:14:48.571 --> 1:14:49.615
Answer it.

1:14:51.312 --> 1:14:53.880
Answer it, please.

1:14:55.534 --> 1:14:56.579
No.

1:14:57.971 --> 1:15:00.670
Answer it or we won't be able
to continue with your riddle.

1:15:00.844 --> 1:15:02.976
I'll just...

1:15:03.150 --> 1:15:04.195
...put it outside.

1:15:06.937 --> 1:15:08.634
Help me.

1:15:10.114 --> 1:15:11.507
Harrison, wait!

1:15:19.863 --> 1:15:20.864
Maria?

1:15:24.041 --> 1:15:25.042
Maria!

1:16:20.271 --> 1:16:23.317
Lauren, hey. Uh, I was actually
gonna come and try and find you.

1:16:23.491 --> 1:16:26.538
Maria's gone.
I went to her apartment
and it's completely empty.

1:16:26.712 --> 1:16:28.322
Do you know
what's going on?

1:16:28.496 --> 1:16:30.498
Smells like moldy cheese
in here.

1:16:30.673 --> 1:16:32.413
Wait, did you hear
what I said? Maria--

1:16:32.588 --> 1:16:34.328
Maria's gone.
She's in trouble or something.

1:16:34.502 --> 1:16:36.853
This place could definitely use
a woman's touch.

1:16:37.027 --> 1:16:39.116
If I happen to meet one,
I'll be sure to let her know.

1:16:39.290 --> 1:16:42.772
Are either of you even
listening to me right now?Maria's fine!

1:16:42.946 --> 1:16:45.165
I just seen her the other day
at Rory Calhoun's office.

1:16:45.339 --> 1:16:46.950
Dressed like a whore, she was.

1:16:47.124 --> 1:16:51.389
She's probably
under his desk right now.

1:16:51.563 --> 1:16:52.869
No. Okay, well,

1:16:53.043 --> 1:16:54.435
I was actually
just up at her apartment

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:55.959
and it's completely empty.

1:16:58.657 --> 1:17:00.093
Well, ain't that a shame.

1:17:00.877 --> 1:17:02.530
Hmm. Guess she moved out then.

1:17:03.183 --> 1:17:06.056
Too bad. I guess I never
get to fuck her after all.

1:17:06.230 --> 1:17:08.798
No, moved out? What?
She's not moved out.

1:17:08.972 --> 1:17:12.540
What do you mean, "moved out"?What you mean, "what do I mean"?
She fucking moved.

1:17:12.715 --> 1:17:16.283
Probably get far away
from your annoying arse.

1:17:18.677 --> 1:17:21.941
It ain't her
they're really after.Wait, what do you mean?

1:17:24.509 --> 1:17:28.208
Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1:17:28.382 --> 1:17:31.298
I ain't gonna pretend
like I understand
what this is all about,

1:17:31.472 --> 1:17:35.128
but there's some people
you just can't say no to.

1:17:35.781 --> 1:17:38.392
What?Well, they can't
come in here.

1:17:38.566 --> 1:17:40.177
So they needed someone...

1:17:42.092 --> 1:17:43.006
on the inside.

1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:44.660
Whoa. Okay.

1:17:44.834 --> 1:17:47.140
Oh, I'm gonna see
if I can remember this properly.

1:17:51.492 --> 1:17:54.234
Three brothers
are traveling along a road

1:17:54.408 --> 1:17:57.368
and they come to an inn
where they plan
to stay the night.

1:17:57.542 --> 1:17:59.283
Wait, wait, stop. What?
How do you know that?

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:02.025
Let me finish.

1:18:04.027 --> 1:18:05.028
Please.

1:18:06.159 --> 1:18:08.858
The cost of the room
is 30 bites of gold,

1:18:09.032 --> 1:18:11.687
so each of the brothers
put in ten apie--

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:17.388
Sorry about that.

1:18:17.562 --> 1:18:19.607
As I was saying,
it's ten apiece

1:18:19.782 --> 1:18:24.090
so the manager wants
to give them a discount
of five gold...

1:18:25.788 --> 1:18:26.876
...pieces.

1:18:29.269 --> 1:18:31.707
What the bloody fuck
are you doing?

1:18:35.449 --> 1:18:37.060
What are you doing?

1:18:41.412 --> 1:18:43.675
So he gives five--

1:18:44.328 --> 1:18:47.810
...gold pieces
to the bellboy

1:18:47.984 --> 1:18:49.637
to take back to--

1:18:49.812 --> 1:18:52.292
Stop it!

1:18:52.466 --> 1:18:54.425
Just calm down, both of you.
Just--

1:18:54.599 --> 1:18:59.386
The bellboy says
he can't split five evenly...

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:01.911
...among three.

1:19:03.173 --> 1:19:04.870
Take it easy. Jesus Christ.

1:19:05.044 --> 1:19:07.743
Bloody fucking hell.
FuckYou all right?

1:19:07.917 --> 1:19:10.571
Just run, run, run!All right, I'm just--

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:34.813
Lauren works for Rory Calhoun.
You obviously know who that is.

1:19:44.867 --> 1:19:46.782
Maria's fine.

1:19:46.956 --> 1:19:49.219
I just seen her the other day
at Rory Calhoun's office.

1:19:49.393 --> 1:19:51.569
Dressed like a whore, she was. What the fuck.

1:20:07.672 --> 1:20:08.716
Oh!

1:20:12.982 --> 1:20:16.768
I know.

1:20:16.942 --> 1:20:19.075
I know, I know.
I'm sorry about all of this.

1:20:19.249 --> 1:20:22.556
But I got the call earlier today
and when they call,

1:20:23.122 --> 1:20:24.515
I have to answer.

1:20:26.473 --> 1:20:29.172
Because everyone
in this world

1:20:29.346 --> 1:20:31.043
has to answer
to somebody, right?

1:20:31.827 --> 1:20:35.352
Well, except for...

1:20:36.353 --> 1:20:37.920
...him.

1:20:38.572 --> 1:20:42.446
But then...
this world, am I right?

1:20:52.978 --> 1:20:55.024
Where's Maria?

1:20:56.939 --> 1:20:58.157
I'm sorry. Who's Maria?

1:20:58.331 --> 1:20:59.332
Come on!

1:21:00.290 --> 1:21:03.336
What the fuck is going--
Please.

1:21:04.424 --> 1:21:07.253
You know, Maria.
Where's--Oh, oh, Maria.

1:21:07.427 --> 1:21:08.907
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That girl.

1:21:09.081 --> 1:21:10.648
That-- That actress
who sent me in

1:21:10.822 --> 1:21:13.825
that really weird tape. Her?

1:21:13.999 --> 1:21:16.567
Yeah.Yeah, okay.
How the hell should I know?

1:21:16.741 --> 1:21:19.483
I can't possibly
cast her in anything.

1:21:20.049 --> 1:21:23.139
Why do you keep calling me?

1:21:23.313 --> 1:21:25.663
Who's the woman
on the phone?Listen,

1:21:25.837 --> 1:21:29.101
I don't have the answers
you're looking for, pal. Okay?

1:21:30.102 --> 1:21:34.367
So, I am just doing
what I'm told.

1:21:34.541 --> 1:21:36.804
Now--She was--
She was--

1:21:36.979 --> 1:21:37.936
We really gotta go.

1:21:38.110 --> 1:21:39.024
Please, no, no!

1:22:07.574 --> 1:22:08.793
See ya, Harry.

1:22:11.535 --> 1:22:12.928
Yup, see you soon.

1:22:48.572 --> 1:22:49.965
Thank you, Rory.

1:22:50.139 --> 1:22:52.880
Your services
are no longer needed.

1:23:27.741 --> 1:23:29.917
I did try
to do it the easy way.

1:23:33.791 --> 1:23:36.098
You can close your eyes
if you like.

1:23:51.461 --> 1:23:55.030
Three brothers are traveling
along a road one night.

1:23:56.074 --> 1:23:57.945
They stop at an inn

1:23:58.903 --> 1:24:02.776
and the cost for the inn
is 30 gold pieces.

1:24:02.950 --> 1:24:04.474
They each pay ten.

1:24:05.649 --> 1:24:09.131
The manager decides
to give them a discount.

1:24:09.305 --> 1:24:12.308
Perhaps the inn
isn't too crowded that night.

1:24:14.571 --> 1:24:17.878
He gives five gold pieces
to a bellhop

1:24:18.053 --> 1:24:20.664
and tells him to return it
to the men.

1:24:22.013 --> 1:24:27.453
The bellhop decides
he cannot divide it
evenly between the three,

1:24:27.627 --> 1:24:30.717
so he pockets two for himself

1:24:30.891 --> 1:24:35.505
and returns one gold piece
to each of the men.

1:24:37.159 --> 1:24:40.466
Each man gets back
one gold piece.

1:24:41.511 --> 1:24:45.254
So now they've given
nine apiece.

1:24:46.168 --> 1:24:49.823
Nine, three times, is 27.

1:24:51.173 --> 1:24:53.958
The bellhop pocketed two.

1:24:54.132 --> 1:24:57.222
Add that to the 27

1:24:57.396 --> 1:24:59.485
and you've got 29.

1:25:02.532 --> 1:25:04.490
But you started with 30.

1:25:15.675 --> 1:25:18.113
Where is the missing piece?

1:25:44.748 --> 1:25:49.144
I hope you know that
this is absolutely not personal.

1:25:51.711 --> 1:25:55.498
The system is mostly infallible.

1:25:55.672 --> 1:26:01.373
I have no idea
who put it into place or why.

1:26:01.547 --> 1:26:02.896
But it works.

1:26:03.070 --> 1:26:06.161
You live, you die,
you live, you die.

1:26:06.944 --> 1:26:11.166
You live, you die,
and we collect these

1:26:12.384 --> 1:26:13.603
each time.

1:26:15.735 --> 1:26:21.001
But sometimes,
there is a glitch.

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:28.792
Generally, nobody has any idea
why it happens,

1:26:28.966 --> 1:26:31.403
but in your case...

1:26:33.579 --> 1:26:35.102
it was the girl.

1:26:41.631 --> 1:26:45.025
Whatever the problem is,
when there is one...

1:26:50.030 --> 1:26:52.381
they send me in to clean it up.

1:26:54.557 --> 1:26:55.949
You should stand back.

1:27:25.849 --> 1:27:27.677
So how did your brother
meet this girl again?

1:27:27.851 --> 1:27:30.506
Susanne?
Do I call her "Susie"?

1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:33.465
Um, I don't know.

1:27:34.466 --> 1:27:38.383
I mean, I-I think
she was a friend of a friend,

1:27:38.557 --> 1:27:41.081
of a friend?
Something like that.

1:27:42.300 --> 1:27:43.823
We shall find out.

1:27:43.997 --> 1:27:45.956
Do you know
where we're going to eat?

1:27:47.174 --> 1:27:49.786
So Cory cooked.Oh, God.

1:27:51.788 --> 1:27:53.746
Where should you and I
go out to eat after?

1:27:55.966 --> 1:27:57.359
I was thinking maybe sushi?

1:27:59.578 --> 1:28:00.971
Did you pay the sitter?

1:28:01.841 --> 1:28:04.279
Yeah. Did it not go through?

1:28:04.453 --> 1:28:06.193
She's saying
it didn't go through.

1:28:06.368 --> 1:28:09.719
Likely story.Well, I'll send it again.

1:28:09.893 --> 1:28:12.504
She's amazing
and Ella loves her so much.

1:28:26.823 --> 1:28:29.347
All right. Ready?

1:28:30.435 --> 1:28:31.741
Let's do this.

1:28:54.590 --> 1:28:55.939
Babe, they're here.

1:28:56.113 --> 1:28:57.462
I heard the knocks.

1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:03.642
Hey, how are you guys?
You look fantastic.

1:29:03.816 --> 1:29:05.557
Thanks for coming.How you doing, buddy?

1:29:05.731 --> 1:29:07.864
Are you guys hungry?Starving.

1:29:08.038 --> 1:29:10.736
Food's almost ready.
How about a drink?Let's do it.

1:29:10.910 --> 1:29:13.826
Yeah, well, what is this?
What did you get me?

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.438
Thank you.
Keeping it tight.Nice and fresh...

1:29:22.661 --> 1:29:23.749
