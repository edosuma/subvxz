Cecile. (KISSES) Thanks for stopping by.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.645
Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.524
Then you restored the timeline
and things were different?

00:42.760 --> 00:43.761
Exactly.

Jesse. You're a speedster.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.091
Better. How much?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.168
Do we really need to ask that question?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.164
Our take wasn't that big.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.888
Big enough.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.765
But the only question you should be asking

01:20.000 --> 01:24.403
is what size rock you want
dangling from this beautiful neck.

I never understood this.

Some of us like to actually
spend the cash we get from these jobs.

Not when it's from the ones with me.

Without us, you'd still be

I think you spend too much time
staring at yourself in the mirror,

02:04.360 --> 02:07.648
because your perception of reality
is a bit warped.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.881

-Guess so.

Okay.
Well, until then, you guys want to train?

a lesson in there, somewhere.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.891
embedded with a tachyon-enhanced laser
out into the multi-verse

13:03.040 --> 13:05.168
and any Earth that is technologically
advanced enough

13:05.360 --> 13:06.407
should be able to receive it.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.603
Okay. Let's say this somehow works.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.842
Just 'cause they can solve a riddle,

13:13.040 --> 13:14.724
doesn't mean they're
a right fit for the team.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.922
- A riddle. Did you say riddle?
-Yeah.

13:17.160 --> 13:22.564
How dare you, sir? This is not a riddle.
This is a complex algorithmic cryptogram

13:22.840 --> 13:25.730
designed to test deductive reasoning, IQ,
problem solving skills,

13:25.920 --> 13:31.211
anything that our team will need to combat
threats, meta-human or otherwise.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.286
Okay. So you're just sending out
an intergalactic IQ test

13:34.520 --> 13:36.249
to all of your doppelgangers
in the multi-verse.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.249
Not just a test.
Think of it as an invitation,

13:38.440 --> 13:41.091
think of it as an elaborate help
wanted ad.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.123
Will it test their attitudes too?

13:43.360 --> 13:45.886
I'm not sure I can stomach another Wells
with your bedside manner.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.448
I care for you too, you jack wagon.
System is calibrated.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.405

-That's it?

14:07.240 --> 14:08.969
- Yeah. That's it.
-So, now what?

14:09.240 --> 14:13.325
Now? We go get a Big Belly Burger.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.131
That's insane. What a rush.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.289
I know. I mean, it took me a while
to get used to it.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.965
I can't believe you're not sick at all.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.963
I must have an iron stomach.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.681
Okay, so you're telling me that Barry
has never taken you on a run?

14:30.920 --> 14:32.001
No.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.965
Well, then, I guess it's
a good thing you've got me.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.485
Guess so.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.329
Whoa, um, hold up.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.681
Oh, uh...

14:43.440 --> 14:45.681
I'm sorry. Am I reading this,
like, completely wrong or something?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.810
No, no. I like you, Jesse. lt'sjust...

14:48.960 --> 14:50.371
It's just what?

14:50.560 --> 14:54.804
Well, you're going home soon.
To another Earth.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.045
Ah, right.
Yeah, yeah. No. It's cool. Yeah.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.207
Jesse,LH

15:00.400 --> 15:03.370
No, no, no. It's totally cool. I get it.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.005

15:06.240 --> 15:07.890
So, uh, still friends, then?

15:08.080 --> 15:09.241
Yeah. Friends.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.926
Well, as friends, I mean,
we can still run around the city, right?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.405
For sure.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.888
Good looking guy. For a criminal.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.764
Well, he's more than just a criminal now.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.890
Apparently he's a meta
who can travel through mirrors.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.923
Oh, oh, I got this one. He's a--

15:29.160 --> 15:30.082
- Mirror Master.
-What the--

15:30.360 --> 15:31.361
- Boom.
-That's good.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.245
Thank you. We had a Mirror Master
on our Earth. Evan McCulloch.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.842
He wasn't a meta, though. He had
some kind of Mirror Gun that he used.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.041
How'd it work?

15:39.440 --> 15:43.365
Must've had dimensional warping tech that
changed everything into two-dimensions.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.370
Well, Scudder is hell-bent
on finding Snart

15:46.560 --> 15:48.449
and he's going after anybody that
worked with him in the past.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.761
Joe's interviewing one of them right now.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.725
Well, all of Snart's known associates
are either presumed dead

15:52.920 --> 15:57.244
or have gone AWOL except for one.
That's her.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.441
HARRISON: Rosalind Dillon.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.564
Says she has the ability
to induce crippling vertigo.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.961
(BOTH STAMMER)

16:03.280 --> 16:06.443
A top. Like a top. She's a top.
That's her name. Top. Amazing.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.641
What? You wanna go?

16:07.960 --> 16:11.760
Okay. Do we think that
she can lead us to Scudder?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.042
Love to see if Joe gets
any answers out of her.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.802
Heard your ex is back in town.
You know anything about that?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.490
He pay you a visit, Miss Dillon?

16:28.480 --> 16:32.087
They don't let people like me
have visitors here, Detective.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.970
All day, all night,
in my boring little cell.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.965
Makes a girl go crazy.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.002
Scudder tried to kill one of your
old crewmates last night. Leon Williams.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.605
Tried? Too bad he failed.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.003
He's gonna try to kill more. Any idea who?

16:50.760 --> 16:54.082
Give us a name, I'll see what we can do
about your current situation.

16:57.200 --> 17:01.603
Okay. Let us know if you change your mind.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.761
Sorry, Joe.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.765
It's all right. I appreciate
you setting up the interview, though.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.486
Looks like I owe you another one.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.647
You know, these lOU's are
starting to pile up.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.644
- I have an idea about that.
-Do you?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.050
Scudder?

17:18.280 --> 17:20.281
You want me, come and get me.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.011
So you saw Sam Scudder and Rosalind Dillon
escape through a glass window?

17:33.280 --> 17:36.841
Like I said, he grabbed her hand.
They walked to the window and poof.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.041
They were gone.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.523
So, mirrors, windows, it sounds like
he can travel through anything

17:41.720 --> 17:42.801
that has a reflective surface.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.201
How exactly does he do that?

17:44.400 --> 17:47.051
He must be able to link
Einstein-Rosen bridges to anything

17:47.240 --> 17:48.605
with high solar reflectance, right?

17:48.800 --> 17:51.883
So he creates wormholes
through reflections. That's a new one.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.402
Look, I can't pretend to understand
or care about the science of it all,

17:55.600 --> 17:58.490
but we need to find Dillon and Scudder
before something really bad happens.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.007
So, I'm gonna go old-school
at the precinct.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.201
- I'll see you later.
-(MONITOR BEEPING)

18:02.440 --> 18:05.250
Oh, my God. Pings. We got pings.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.205
Looks like some of your
doppelgangers out there

18:07.440 --> 18:08.726
actually cracked your code, Harry.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.001
That was fast.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.881
Let's go take a look.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.201
Guys... (STAMMERS)

18:17.120 --> 18:19.202
Um, Dad seems fine.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.728
Um, yeah. No, he's still a little weird
about it.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.160
You talked to him though, right?

18:24.440 --> 18:27.444
Um, yeah. I did. Yeah. It'll be good.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.561
- Okay, great.
-Yeah.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.285
- Then I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.720
You'll pick a good movie?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.571
- I'll try.
-Okay.

no one else cares about right now.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.171

18:48.000 --> 18:50.002
How many times
do I have to tell you, Rosa?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.125
I was stuck in there.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.726
Whatever it was that hit me,
gave me this crazy ability.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.971
And to me, all of this
just happened last night.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.440
It's been three years, Sam.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.850
So many things are different now.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.491
You were hit, too, weren't you?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.051
- You can do things like me?
-Yeah.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.521

What do you mean
you don't think it's gonna work?

28:57.640 --> 29:00.325
- I built this to go to absolute zero.
-I realize that. But we need the mirror

29:00.520 --> 29:04.002
to maintain zero point energy long enough
for Barry's molecules to pass through it.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.685
Absolute zero's more than
cold enough to do that.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.888
Normally, but we have to account
for internal energy

29:08.120 --> 29:09.804
of the mirror's molecules as well.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.367
So absolute cold might be
lowest possible temperature--

29:12.640 --> 29:14.324
It's not the lowest enthalpy state
possible.

This is, uh, Doctor Caitlin Snow.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.521
- Hi.
-She is brilliant.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.364
- Single.
-Don%.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.688
All right. That's my daughter,
you don't have to shake her hand,

38:11.880 --> 38:14.042
uh, that gentleman there is Wally West,
this is Barry Allen.

38:14.240 --> 38:18.006
Or as we call him on this Earth,
the Flash.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.765
Welcome to Earth-1.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.162
Thanks. (CHUCKLES) Earth-1. That's weird.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.011
Okay.
Well, we don't have to stand on ceremony.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.527
We don't have to go through all
the tears again, do we gang? Right?

38:32.720 --> 38:35.200
- Well, did I-- Did I cry last time?
-I'm talking about myself.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.361
Oh, that's right.

38:36.560 --> 38:41.441
Hey, listen. Don't worry about him, okay?
There's only one Harry.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.931
(CHUCKLES)

38:47.520 --> 38:48.931
I wanted to tell you.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.681
The molecular decelerator,
it wasn't working.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.246
What does that mean?

38:54.440 --> 38:57.364
It means that we did not get Barry
out of the mirror. it wasn't us.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.285
Then who did it?

38:59.560 --> 39:00.971
You tell me.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.251
See you later.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.484
Earth-2's gonna have
one hell of a speedster protecting it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.284
Well, I did learn from the best.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.209
If you ever need any help,
you know how to get back.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.971
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, I'll be back.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.325
- All right.
-(CHUCKLES)

39:17.680 --> 39:20.923
Okay. You guys. Ready?

39:21.240 --> 39:22.924
Uh, yeah.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.841
Okay, Cisco. Out with the old.
In with the new.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.281
Oh...

39:28.560 --> 39:30.085
You'll never be old to us, Harry.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.327
(CHUCKLES)

39:35.080 --> 39:36.809
- Ready?
-Yeah. Okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.082
Okay. Let's do this.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.204
Oh, one more thing. While I'm gone,
never, ever, no matter what--

39:46.080 --> 39:47.081
Oh, oh.

39:47.760 --> 39:52.527
(CHUCKLES) What was he gonna say?
We're all, like, "What was he gonna say?"

39:52.720 --> 39:57.362
That's cool, though. I'm starving.
You guys have Big Belly Burger?

39:58.040 --> 39:59.610
Some things never change.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.607
Famished.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.811
Barry say anything about this
embarrassing moment with Cecile?

40:07.040 --> 40:08.041
_H€Y-
_H€Y-

40:08.280 --> 40:09.247
Hey-

40:09.440 --> 40:11.488
How did your first meeting go
with the new Wells?

40:12.440 --> 40:15.489
(CHUCKLES) Uh, good.
Yeah, I think he'll work out fine.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.007
- Good. I look forward to meeting him.
-Mmm. Whoa.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.484
- What?
-I'm just kidding. (CHUCKLING)

40:22.000 --> 40:24.970
I gotta be honest. It's gonna take
a bit for me to get used to that.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.281
Um...

40:26.840 --> 40:30.003
I actually have something to run by you
guys that I think might help with that.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.129
- Really? What up?
-Yeah.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.761
Uh, well, I've just been thinking
that maybe for all of us

40:34.960 --> 40:39.124
that I should probably,
um, get my own place?

40:40.200 --> 40:42.043
- Really?
-Yeah. What do you think?

40:44.080 --> 40:45.081
I say yes.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.288
- I thought you'd never leave.
-Seriously?

40:47.480 --> 40:48.891
- Dad!
-Yep. Look, Barr, come on.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.884
I'm gonna miss you, but damn!
You're grown. About time.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.044
I can't tell if I'm leaving or
if I'm getting kicked out.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.725
You feel like you feel.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.211
- I mean...
-Feel like I'm getting kicked out.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.561
Yeah.
I feel like you're getting kicked out too.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.730
Like, it's pretty obvious
you're getting kicked out. Dad!

41:02.880 --> 41:04.041
(LAUGHTER)

41:04.280 --> 41:05.441
Well. Cool.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.444
(EXHALES)

41:48.680 --> 41:49.966
