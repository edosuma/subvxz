16:23.015 --> 16:24.950

20:33.932 --> 20:37.369
{\an1}For Centulons our species
have been at war,

20:37.436 --> 20:39.771
{\an1}but the one thing
I know Jupiter Jim values

20:39.838 --> 20:41.773
above all else

20:41.840 --> 20:44.142
is interplanetary peace.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.379
- That is my prime directive...

20:47.446 --> 20:49.982
- And peace begins with a hug.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.684
What do you say?
Bring it in, bro.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.020
[yelps]
- Peace, ahoy.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.191
{\an1}- Little mustard
on that hug, but all good.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.094
{\an3}- Now that our species
have a tenuous alliance,

21:02.160 --> 21:04.763
I'll be seeing you
around the galaxy.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.165
- I would love that.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.835
- Peace wins the day.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.203
But I'll be watching you.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.739
{\an1}- Uh, guys?
Just wanted to point out that

21:13.805 --> 21:17.075
{\an1}these "villains" are actually
regular people in costumes!

21:17.142 --> 21:18.910
{\an1}Just wanted make it clear
so we're all on

21:18.977 --> 21:20.445
the same page moving forward.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.317
<i>- Until we meet again!</i>

21:26.518 --> 21:30.689
- [sighs]
How I miss my spandex onesies.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.358
- Ah, right where we left you.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.760
{\an3}- Oh, uh...
[clears throat]

21:34.826 --> 21:36.328
Hello, sons.

21:36.395 --> 21:39.264
{\an3}How was your day hanging out
with Jupiter Jerk?

21:39.331 --> 21:42.434
- Eh, it had its ups and downs.
But who needs that guy?

21:42.501 --> 21:44.970
As far as we're concerned,
we live with our hero.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.305
Our non-kidnap-y hero.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.275
{\an1}- Yeah, tell us
about that stuntman again.

21:50.342 --> 21:53.045
- Oh, Chad!
[chuckles]

21:53.111 --> 21:55.647
What a prankster.
