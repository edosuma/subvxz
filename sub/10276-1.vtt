01:10.704 --> 01:13.839
No one's better at
Capture the Conch than me.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.575
Watch this.
- Go for it, Fluke, go!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.578
- I got him.
- No, I do.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.717
I got ya, Fluke.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.286
You sure about that, Oona?

01:28.755 --> 01:31.924
Ha! Capture the conch.
I win again.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.927
- Nice move.
- You're so fast, Fluke.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.162
Lookin' good, Fluke.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.597
I don't know
how you do it.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.766
It just comes naturally.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.634
Hey, you guys, why'd
the octopus cross the reef?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.638
To get to
the other tide.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.940
( all laughing )

01:47.942 --> 01:51.343
Oh, Fluke,
you crack me up.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.645
Who wants to watch me
juggle sea urchins?

01:53.647 --> 01:54.980
- I do.
- Me, too.

01:59.853 --> 02:03.288
- It's the floating palace.
- The floating what?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.958
Princess Sofia's ship.
She's back!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.627
Sofia's back?
Wait for me, Oona.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.670
It sure feels good
to be back at Merroway Cove.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.073
It's too bad Mr. Cedric
didn't want to come this time.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.775
He said he couldn't think of
a more monstrous vacation,

02:23.777 --> 02:25.644
whatever that means.

02:25.646 --> 02:30.149
Oh, this is so relaxing.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.951
Last one in
is a rotten fish egg.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.255
James, you got
my bathing suit all wet.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.789
Isn't that what it's for?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.324
That is the last thing
it's for.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.327
Your beverage
and sun spectacles,
Princess Amber.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.795
Wonderful, Baileywick.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.430
Thank you.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.399
It's so nice of the mermaids
to let us visit

02:47.401 --> 02:50.769
- whenever we want.
- It sure is.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.739
Perhaps we should do something
to show our appreciation.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.774
Like sending
a thank-you note.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.310
- Or throwing them
a party tonight.
- Great idea, Mom.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.413
Ooh, I'll wear
my finest beach gown.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.882
There's just one problem,
Your Majesties.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.751
How do we invite
the mer-people?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.719
Good point.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.421
None of us can really dive
all the way down there

03:09.423 --> 03:11.190
- to tell them.
- I can.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.858
I mean, uh,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.860
I can go try to find
my mermaid friend Oona.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.028
She comes up to
the surface a lot.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.763
She can tell everyone.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.465
Or we can tie an invitation
to our anchor

03:20.467 --> 03:22.034
and drop it
over their castle.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.835
Let's try Sofia's plan.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.071
Great. I'll go look for her
at the beach.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.140
Tell Oona the party
will start at sunset.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.908
Okay, Mom.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.281
Oona!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.783
Sofia!

04:12.885 --> 04:15.754
I'm so glad
you're back.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.322
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.325
Guess what, guys.
My family's throwing
a party at sunset

04:20.327 --> 04:22.127
- for all the mermaids.
- Fun.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.129
Oh, I can't wait
to tell everyone.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.064
Can you guys
spread the word
about the party?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.833
Yeah, sure.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.535
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Let me handle this.

04:34.207 --> 04:38.210
The sea pony express
is at your service, my lady.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.978
All right, sea-ponies.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.948
Tell Queen Emmaline and all
the mer-folks in Merroway Cove,

04:42.950 --> 04:46.318
Sofia's family is throwing
a party at sunset

04:46.320 --> 04:50.822
by the floating palace,
and everyone's invited! Go!

04:52.392 --> 04:53.925
Well, that
takes care of that.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.461
Let's go find
my friends, Sofia.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.929
They didn't get
to meet you last time.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.865
- Okay.
- This way.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.900
Whoa. Wait for me.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.305
Hey, everyone.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.041
Look who's here.
Princess Sofia.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.810
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.945
We've heard so much
about you, Sofia.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.815
What's it like being able
to turn into a mermaid?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.917
Can you switch back and forth
any time you want?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.385
What's it like
having legs?

05:20.387 --> 05:21.820
What's it like
living on land?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.822
It's much dryer up there.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.292
Excuse me. Is anyone
going to introduce me?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.394
Oh, sorry.
This is Fluke.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.829
And you are?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.898
Sofia.
Nice to meet you.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.099
It always is.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.901
Now, if you don't mind,

05:35.903 --> 05:37.336
I have some sea urchins
to juggle.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.304
Oh, I forgot to tell
you all the best part.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.540
Sofia's family's
throwing a beach party tonight,

05:41.542 --> 05:43.342
and we're all invited.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.477
No way!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.012
I'm so excited.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.147
Ooh, what's your family
like, Sofia?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.449
Are they all human?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.150
What else would they be?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.852
I don't get it, Slim.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.987
What makes her
so special?

05:55.989 --> 05:58.457
Probably being human,
if I had to guess.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.259
Well, I don't see
what's so special about that.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.929
It's not special
at all, Fluke.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.997
How dare they pay
attention to her
and not you?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.100
Oh, it really
blows my bubbles.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.868
That's really super
of your parents

06:09.870 --> 06:11.603
to throw a party
for us.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.538
Maybe we should do
something for them
in return.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.440
We could
give them a gift.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.509
Or we could play
a song for them.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.378
- We have a band.
- You do?

06:19.380 --> 06:20.979
That sounds like
a terrific gift.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.014
Hey, let's play one of
our songs for Sofia.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.083
- Do you wanna hear one?
- Sure.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.953
We'll get
the instruments.

06:27.955 --> 06:31.056
A song? What kind
of gift is that?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.891
I could do much better.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.993
So much better.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.294
So what are you
gonna get?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.996
Oh, um...

06:43.970 --> 06:45.437
I know.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.606
I'll get the pearl
out of that giant clam.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.442
Now that's a gift fit for
a king and queen.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.078
You'll be the star fish
of the party.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.081
Okay, guys,
a-one, a-two,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.116
a-one, two, three, four.

without that giant clam
chomping you?

08:01.548 --> 08:04.082
Come on. With my
blazing speed,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.084

08:29.175 --> 08:31.343
- Fluke!
- I can't get out.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.612
You guys, help me
open the clam.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.048
It's no use.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.184
It won't budge.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.719
Hm. Oh!

08:42.355 --> 08:43.755
Let me try this.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.130
Oh!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.067
Great thinking, Sofia.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.202
You saved him.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.703
Look at that, Slim.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.772
She could do anything
and they'd love her.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.474
Are you okay, Fluke?

09:02.476 --> 09:05.143
I didn't really
need your help, you know.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.412
Oh, well, it seemed
like you did.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.080
Oh, my horn!

09:09.082 --> 09:10.582
Oh, I'm sorry, Flip.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.118
It was the only way
to pry that clam open.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.221
I know.
It's okay.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.423
What were you
thinking, Fluke,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.325
swimming so close
to that giant clam?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.294
I was trying to get
a better gift

09:22.296 --> 09:24.763
for Sofia's family
than some silly song.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.531
Well, with no
mantacorn horn,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.366
our band can't play
for them now.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.136
Yeah, the horn
really defines their sound.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.571
What's a mantacorn?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.472
You've never seen
a mantacorn?

09:34.474 --> 09:36.441
Oh, it's a big, scary
manta ray

09:36.443 --> 09:39.177
with a really sharp horn
sticking out of its forehead.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.713
Mantacorns shed their horns
every year and grow new ones,

09:41.715 --> 09:46.084
but they keep the old ones
in a special cave like treasure.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.485
We were lucky
to have this one.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.287
I know where
we can get another one.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.823
- In the mantacorn's cave.
- No!

09:51.825 --> 09:53.592
We can't go
in there, Fluke.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.260
I've heard whoever
swims into that cave

09:55.262 --> 09:57.095
doesn't swim out.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.464
That mantacorn's old
and sleeps all the time.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.466
I'll swim in and grab
one of his old horns

10:01.468 --> 10:03.168
before he even
wakes up.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.769
That doesn't sound
like a good idea.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.271
Not if you're slow,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.106
but if you're
quick like me,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.275
it's no problem.
Back in a flash.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.546
I'm worried
about Fluke.

10:14.548 --> 10:15.814
He could really
get hurt.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.248
Then we can't
let him do it.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.450
You're right, Sofia.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.718
We should stop him.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.721
I agree 100%.
You should stop him.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.889
Come on, Sven.
We'll be back.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.894
Where's Fluke?

10:29.896 --> 10:31.563
He already went inside.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.264
We should go in
after him.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.699
But we might wake up
the mantacorn.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.168
I concur.
The best course of action

10:37.170 --> 10:40.338
is to stay right here
where it's perfectly safe.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.310
Look out!

10:48.247 --> 10:49.714
We're trapped.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.549
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

10:51.551 --> 10:53.184
SOFIA: Let's get
out of sight.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.453
- I'm done for.
- Sven, get it together.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.622
- It'll be okay.
- No, it won't.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.558
Sea horses are a mantacorn's
favorite food.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.327
He's right. They can eat
like a whole herd

11:02.329 --> 11:03.795
in one sitting.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.297
I'm like a floating
pink soufflé.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.866
Maybe there's
another way out of here.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.267
I'll take a look.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.642
Fluke. Over here.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.712
What are you doing here?
I said I'd get the horn.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.881
We came to stop you
before you get hurt.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.949
I'm fine.
Just get outta here.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.351
We can't, Fluke.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.220
The entrance
is blocked. Look.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.325
( snoring )

11:34.327 --> 11:36.361
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure out

11:36.363 --> 11:38.730
to get us out after
I find the stash of old horns.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.665
There's no time for that.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.867
Sh! You'll wake
the mantacorn.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.676
Look. I think we can
sneak past him now.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.245
Not until I find
a mantacorn horn.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.447
Whoa, look.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.215
There's one.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.551
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.687
You'll wake him
up for sure.
Let's just go.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.290
Oona's right.
Everyone follow me.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.791
Follow you?
I'm the leader of this pack.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.827
Fluke!

12:18.537 --> 12:20.505
- Fluke!
- ( screams )

12:20.507 --> 12:23.908
What's this?
Horn thieves.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.310
This way.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.578
Get back here.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.613
SVEN: Swim for your lives!

12:28.615 --> 12:31.382
Argh! I'll skewer ya.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.384
You don't really
wanna eat me.

12:33.386 --> 12:37.288
I'm bony, kinda fishy.
Way past my "eat by" date.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.958
I don't wanna be
a Sven-kabob!

12:45.698 --> 12:49.367
Argh. Where'd ya go?

12:49.369 --> 12:52.270
Fluke, why did you try
to take that horn?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.671
We could've
gotten away.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.740
Ah, don't sweat it,
Princess.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.342
I've got it
all under control.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.677
Here's the plan.
I'll swim out there

12:59.679 --> 13:01.746
and get the mantacorn
to chase me.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.749
Then you can all sneak out
while he's busy with me.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.485
- OONA: That's way too risky.
- ( gasps )

13:07.487 --> 13:09.420
Risk is my middle name.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.589
- I thought it was
Clarence.
- Sh!

13:11.591 --> 13:14.993
Nobody pilfers
me precious horns.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.928
I don't want you
to get hurt, Fluke.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.764
We need to stick
together so we can
all get out of here.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.800
Okay, fine.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.802
There's gotta be a back tunnel
that leads out of the caves.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.404
We just have to find it.
Follow me, everyone.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.739
No way, Fluke.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.641
We would've already
gotten out

13:29.643 --> 13:31.576
if you hadn't tried
to get that mantacorn horn.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.578
I'm not following
you anywhere.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.748
I guess you'd rather
follow the princess.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.650
Well, go on, Sofia.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.585
Be everyone's hero,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.821
just like before.

13:42.823 --> 13:46.090
When I find
the cave robbers...

13:46.092 --> 13:48.092
Is that why you
tried to take the horn,

13:48.094 --> 13:51.663
because everyone started
paying attention to me
instead of you?

13:51.665 --> 13:52.797
Well, I, uh...

13:52.799 --> 13:54.499
Fluke.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.800
All right, yes.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.902
I mean, everyone
looked up to me

13:57.904 --> 13:59.737
until you showed up.

13:59.739 --> 14:03.508
I thought if I got the horn,
I'd be the hero.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.810
Fluke, it doesn't matter
who leads the way,

14:05.812 --> 14:07.712
as long as we all
make it out all right.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.647
I guess you're right.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.351
Good, because I think
we should find that back tunnel.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.986
Lead the way, <i> Sofia.</i>

14:18.490 --> 14:20.892
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.394
Come on.
This way.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.830
There you are.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.832
You sneak thieves.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.701
OONA: Hurry, Sofia!
Come on.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.135
SOFIA: I'm trying.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.471
SVEN: He's gaining
on us.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.073
I'm too young
to be lunch.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.575
- FLUKE: Keep going!
- There's nowhere to swim.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.512
- OONA: Hurry, Sofia.
- I can't go any faster.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.519
Come on!
Come on!

14:48.521 --> 14:50.154
In here, Sofia.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.761
( gasps )
There's the way out.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.063
Wait. We should
go this way.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.234
There's too much
seaweed.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.869
I know.
I have a plan.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.405
You're not just doing
this to show off, are you?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.475
No. It's the only
way we'll get away.
You've gotta trust me.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.711
Don't be
takin' me horns.
I'll skewer ya!

15:13.713 --> 15:16.547
I don't care where we go
as long as we go now!

15:16.549 --> 15:18.983
Okay, I say we go
Fluke's way.

15:18.985 --> 15:21.185
- Follow me, guys.
- Okay.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.596
- Whoa!
- Why are you stopping?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.931
There they are.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.499
The entire stash
of mantacorn horns.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.067
Fluke.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.568
( growling )

15:39.605 --> 15:40.705
We have to go.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.974
Get back here.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.477
FLUKE: Come on.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.913
He's too fast.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.449
Everyone grab
onto me.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.552
Hold on.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.989
I told you, Fluke,
there's too much seaweed.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.958
Just swim through it.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.960
Through here.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.671
There you are.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.507
We were worried.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.610
Blasted seaweed!

16:21.046 --> 16:24.115
Ya fish-tailed
hornswogglers.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
Mantacorn!

16:26.219 --> 16:28.186
Don't worry, Flip.
He can't get us.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.620
He's stuck in
the seaweed.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.055
That was your plan?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.657
Yep.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.225
So we're safe?

16:34.227 --> 16:36.561
We're safe.
Thanks, Fluke.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.529
You're our hero.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.066
- I am?
- You are.
You saved all of us.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.169
Good thinking, Fluke,
getting him stuck
in that seaweed.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.840
Argh. You little
mer-monsters.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.542
What did I ever
do to you?

16:51.544 --> 16:52.844
You tried to
skewer us.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.646
I was just mindin'
my own business,

16:55.648 --> 16:57.215
takin' a nap.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.651
And you tried
to steal me horn.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.120
Now look at me.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.523
We can't just
leave him like that.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.025
Sure, we can.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.559
Probably better that way.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.094
I'm going to help him.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.562
Me, too.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.931
I'm comin'.

17:13.933 --> 17:17.101
I'm just gonna
hang back here,
or flee.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.107
SOFIA:
This is really tangled.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.677
There you go, sir.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.546
( stretches )

17:31.216 --> 17:33.051
That's much better.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.220
We're really sorry
about all this, Mr. Mantacorn.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.556
We just needed a new horn
for my friends' band.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.858
Well, you coulda
just asked me.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.960
I'm happy to
lend you a horn.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.129
I love music.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.932
- You do?
- Of course.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.272
Now, what kind of horn
do you need?

17:54.274 --> 17:56.641
I've got a bunch
of tenors, a few altos.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.042
Can you play me a tune?

17:58.044 --> 18:00.912
I really love surf music
and new wave, too.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.048
Although I am partial
to old wave.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.316
SVEN: Ah, here
he comes again!

18:05.318 --> 18:07.585
Don't eat me!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.153
It's okay, little guy.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.123
Mantacorns don't
eat sea horses.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.192
That's just an old
mer-wives' tale.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.194
Really? What do they eat?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.929
Puffer fish.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.773
Where is everyone?
Oh, please don't tell me

18:28.775 --> 18:30.908
I got all dressed up
for nothing.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.077
Maybe Sofia couldn't
find Oona,

18:33.079 --> 18:35.079
and the mer-people
don't know about the party.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.647
Look on the bright side.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.649
More food for us.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.919
Let's give them
a little more time,
shall we?

18:43.789 --> 18:46.824
Huh. Something's
happening.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.726
MIRANDA: Here they come!

19:08.747 --> 19:10.681
Welcome, everyone.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.083
But where is Sofia?

19:12.085 --> 19:13.918
Mom, Dad.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.720
I guess you found Oona.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.222
Uh-huh, and we have
a special surprise
for everyone.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.424
- What's that?
- A little performance,

19:20.426 --> 19:23.127
just for us.
Okay, gang.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.711
May I present to you
the Mer-tones,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.680
performing a special song
in honor of

19:42.682 --> 19:44.882
the king and queen
of Enchancia.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.250
