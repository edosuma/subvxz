01:40.500 --> 01:43.020
The principle, Your Honor,
is informed waiver,

01:43.124 --> 01:47.119
a concept deeply embedded
in the black-letter law of this state.

01:47.189 --> 01:51.467
This is a simple case of a contract
willingly and completely executed.

01:51.541 --> 01:55.219
Appeals to the contrary, based on emotion,
have no place in a court of law.

01:59.927 --> 02:03.669
- Objection!
- Order, order!

02:03.766 --> 02:08.274
This is not a court of law.
You did not enter through a doorway.

02:08.342 --> 02:12.118
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the rabbit hole
and we, like so many Alices,

02:12.184 --> 02:17.367
have plunged through it
directly into Wonderland.

02:17.432 --> 02:22.037
Behold the Queen of Hearts,
Carraghan Chemical.

02:22.105 --> 02:27.604
A company that has spewed its bile
into the Leffingwell River for 17 years.

02:27.673 --> 02:30.641
Plants wither. Children die.

02:30.714 --> 02:34.063
And there isn't a court in the land
that can stop them.

02:34.169 --> 02:37.465
Finally, one man has had enough.

02:38.714 --> 02:44.148
Frustrated, desperate, he slams
his truck into the plant manager's office

02:44.251 --> 02:49.041
and for one bright, shining day,
that hellhole of a factory shuts down.

02:49.115 --> 02:52.792
Do we honor him?
Do we throw him a parade?

02:52.892 --> 02:55.707
Do we even say thank you?

02:55.804 --> 02:59.962
No. He is put on trial.

03:00.029 --> 03:03.379
- Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party.
- Objection!

03:03.486 --> 03:05.690
Objection? Why not "Off with their heads"?

03:05.757 --> 03:08.026
...paid him fully, according to the contract.

03:08.125 --> 03:11.508
But now he wants more and he intends
to get it by harassing my client.

03:11.614 --> 03:14.035
Yes, the plaintiff is
a man of moderate means.

03:14.110 --> 03:17.045
Yes, Xydex is a very successful corporation.

03:17.118 --> 03:20.315
But the law, not charity,
must dictate our course today.

03:20.895 --> 03:22.903
Yes, yes.

03:24.895 --> 03:26.968
He rammed through that wall.

03:27.039 --> 03:31.612
And, yes, he did shut
that hellish factory down for one day.

03:31.680 --> 03:37.213
And, yes, he is responsible
for damages in the amount of $427,000.

03:37.281 --> 03:40.892
How high a price is that to pay
if he saved just one single life?

03:40.961 --> 03:45.434
Madam, I will give you $427,000
for your child. Deal?

03:46.530 --> 03:50.424
And you, madam.
Same price for your husband.

03:50.530 --> 03:54.392
And you, counselor. How about half
a million bucks for your precious hide?

03:54.499 --> 03:56.954
- Objection!
- Order!

03:57.059 --> 04:00.093
- The counsel is out of line.
- Sustained.

04:00.162 --> 04:02.170
Mr Ward, sit down.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.633
Order, order!

04:04.741 --> 04:07.074
Defense is prepared to mount its case.

04:07.172 --> 04:09.955
We have witnesses,

04:10.053 --> 04:13.533
depositions and evidence
to prove my client acted fairly.

04:13.604 --> 04:17.434
But to what end? The plaintiff has
put no viable case before this court.

04:17.541 --> 04:21.372
Defense moves for nonsuit.
Submitted, Your Honor.

04:21.445 --> 04:26.051
Would you go next door and remind them
thatjustice is blind, and not deaf?

04:27.654 --> 04:30.043
As to your motion, counsel...

04:31.399 --> 04:33.732
12 minutes.
12 minutes!

04:33.799 --> 04:36.799
Eight and a half days
it took those idiots to mount their case!

04:36.903 --> 04:42.271
- Too bad you mispronounced "harassing. "
- It's too bad you didn't get a chance to.

04:42.375 --> 04:45.376
Counselor, where will you be
spending your vacation?

04:45.448 --> 04:49.726
- I have no vacation.
- Maggie! You must have three or four weeks.

04:49.801 --> 04:53.314
No. I hear something big's
happening on Argo Motors.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.785
- Do you know anything about it?
- No.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.409
Have you?
I haven't heard.

04:57.481 --> 05:00.416
You guys wanna be big-time lawyers,
learn to lie better.

05:00.490 --> 05:02.498
Maggie! Lawyers never lie.

05:02.569 --> 05:07.239
We just tell the truth judiciously
to guarantee utter confusion.

05:07.338 --> 05:11.616
Damn, you could lose your hand
in one of this things.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.809
Mr Ward, excuse me.
Howard Crayhill.

05:24.907 --> 05:28.203
<i>I've read all your books.
I've read Civil Rights on Trial twice.</i>

05:28.300 --> 05:32.295
Congratulations.
You found a copy they hadn't burned.

05:33.773 --> 05:36.195
Grateful client?

05:36.301 --> 05:39.880
No, it's a present for your mother.
Anniversary.

05:39.982 --> 05:43.212
Hard to believe we've been together 34 years.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.066
35.

05:50.352 --> 05:54.541
You're biting your fingernails again, Margaret.

05:56.943 --> 05:58.918
Don't.

06:00.145 --> 06:02.381
Minor flesh wound.
He didn't even draw blood.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.937
Brian, my father always draws blood.

06:14.706 --> 06:19.310
I was getting ready to make a left.
I had the blinker on.

06:19.377 --> 06:24.300
I saw the other car coming towards me,
in the rearview mirror.

06:24.371 --> 06:26.859
And I couldn't move.
I couldn't get out of the way.

06:26.931 --> 06:29.931
I just watched him, in slow motion.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.989
At first, I couldn't believe it was happening.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.224
It was like watching TV or something.

06:38.292 --> 06:40.780
And then the guy hit me.

06:40.853 --> 06:46.221
The carjust... Itjust exploded.

06:46.293 --> 06:49.293
There was fire everywhere.

06:49.908 --> 06:52.757
My wife started screaming,

06:52.821 --> 06:54.830
and my baby boy...

06:56.598 --> 06:58.770
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.811
You have nothing to apologize for.

07:01.910 --> 07:03.886
What happened to you...

07:09.431 --> 07:11.886
I'm so goddamned tired of this.

07:11.991 --> 07:15.026
Those bastards think
they can do anything they want.

07:15.097 --> 07:19.319
Lie, kill, destroy whatever
they touch and get away with it.

07:19.384 --> 07:23.094
Let me tell you something, Steven.
They don't always get away with it.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.838
Once in a while, people like us,
this law firm, we stop them.

07:26.938 --> 07:29.239
This is going to be one of those times.

07:29.306 --> 07:31.477
Mr Ward, I'm very grateful.

07:31.545 --> 07:35.539
I just wish that I had been
with your firm from the beginning.

07:35.642 --> 07:38.194
We're here now.

07:44.378 --> 07:47.346
Good afternoon.
Quinn Califan and Lunt.

07:47.419 --> 07:52.657
I'm sorry, he's away from his desk right now.
May I take a message?

07:52.763 --> 07:53.745
Hold on one second.

07:53.820 --> 07:54.901
Maggie!

07:55.005 --> 07:59.543
- Maggie, Mr Grazier wants to see you.
- Now?

08:01.149 --> 08:04.662
OK, tell me what you know
about Argo Motors.

08:04.766 --> 08:07.581
They're our biggest client.
21% of last year's billing.

08:07.678 --> 08:12.533
26. They're headed up by Eugene Forrest.
He came aboard two years ago...

08:12.638 --> 08:16.698
In a hostile takeover. Thinks the future
of automobiles is in computerization.

08:16.799 --> 08:20.443
Rumor is now that he's looking
to merge with a Silicon Valley type.

08:20.510 --> 08:24.505
Wrong. He found it.
LorCoTron Electronics.

08:24.608 --> 08:26.746
Jeez. Big time.

08:26.847 --> 08:31.071
But there's a catch.
And this is where we come in.

08:31.168 --> 08:34.429
Three years ago, a class action suit
was filed against Argo,

08:34.529 --> 08:38.784
claiming that their 1985 station wagon,
the Meridian, blew up on impact.

08:38.881 --> 08:41.400
- So? Lawsuits are a dime a dozen.
- Did they have a case?

08:41.472 --> 08:47.638
No. I've handled Argo since that car was
still on the drawing boards. It's totally clean.

08:47.714 --> 08:51.358
We persuaded the other side's attorneys
that they couldn't win.

08:51.426 --> 08:54.908
But now another firm has re-filed.
A much more aggressive firm.

08:55.011 --> 08:59.387
The new American way.
Find the guy who built it, then rob him blind.

09:00.163 --> 09:03.197
- So what do we do, guys?
- Settle, for chump change.

09:03.267 --> 09:07.546
- Confidentiality clause, don't tell the papers.
- No, we have to win in public.

09:07.652 --> 09:11.230
LorCoTron is a very conscientious
company, very consumer-oriented.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.051
This LorCoTron thing is time-critical.
You can't...

09:14.116 --> 09:16.768
OK, OK!

09:16.838 --> 09:19.653
If I decide we fight it,
one of you will be on point.

09:19.718 --> 09:21.987
It's good input.

09:22.469 --> 09:24.477
Thanks for your time.

09:26.791 --> 09:30.052
My hobby is rebuilding American cars...

09:30.118 --> 09:32.126
Get outta here!

09:50.856 --> 09:52.711
Michael.

09:57.673 --> 10:00.064
You have to give me this case.

10:02.282 --> 10:04.616
I know Argo backwards and forwards.

10:04.682 --> 10:07.104
I'm a better litigator
than any other associate

10:07.210 --> 10:09.927
and you're too busy to go to court
on all the prep work.

10:09.994 --> 10:13.159
Bernstein has a lot going for him.
He's a team player.

10:13.259 --> 10:15.398
Second team.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.710
Maggie!

10:16.811 --> 10:20.456
Please! This is the partnership express.
I deserve this.

10:20.524 --> 10:24.997
- Why are you throwing lightweights at me?
- Look. OK. OK!

10:25.996 --> 10:28.003
I want you on this one.

10:28.076 --> 10:30.532
There's no question.

10:30.605 --> 10:33.988
- There's a problem.
- What?

10:35.181 --> 10:38.695
Plaintiff's attorney's your father.

10:43.854 --> 10:46.538
Yeah? What's wrong?

10:46.607 --> 10:51.845
- We got no case.
- Sure we have a case. Look at the facts.

10:51.920 --> 10:56.142
I've looked. Looked at the probability charts
backwards and forwards, Jed.

10:56.207 --> 11:00.234
The facts are that Argo built a half a million
Meridians and a few of them blew up.

11:01.136 --> 11:03.690
132 cars?

11:03.761 --> 11:06.249
On a half a million built,
that's only a few cars.

11:06.321 --> 11:10.064
That's not that many more
than would have blown up no matter what.

11:10.130 --> 11:16.011
Maybe Argo designed it wrong, maybe they
didn't. But that doesn't make a case.

11:16.082 --> 11:20.305
Hey, I got a car that blows up, people
like Steven who almost died in 'em.

11:20.370 --> 11:24.812
I got a car company that doesn't give a shit.
To me that makes a case.

11:24.883 --> 11:30.448
Rosenberg Blittman had everything
that we have. They had it for three years.

11:30.548 --> 11:33.003
They dropped the case.
Couldn't find anything.

11:33.108 --> 11:36.141
Billy Blittman couldn't find
his butt with both hands.

11:39.348 --> 11:42.447
That's true, but it's a contingency case, Jed.

11:42.548 --> 11:46.641
Even if we win, we see no money for years.
Can we afford that?

11:46.741 --> 11:50.570
Hey, I know it's not a slam dunk, Nick.

11:52.022 --> 11:56.081
Once in a while, you just gotta go
with your gut, the passion.

11:56.182 --> 11:59.248
I got a real feeling about this one.
Network news-time.

11:59.351 --> 12:03.213
- Jed, I like seeing you on TV. Really...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:03.351 --> 12:07.126
It's not about my ego.
It's about us. What we stand for.

12:07.224 --> 12:11.085
This firm was built on David and Goliath
cases. They're not around any more.

12:11.191 --> 12:14.737
All these fascist Reagan judges
hear you're after a big corporation,

12:14.808 --> 12:17.459
they throw your ass right out of court.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.351
It's too discouraging.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.929
Something like this comes along.
Good plaintiffs, decent evidence.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.172
Ajudge who'll listen.

12:25.274 --> 12:29.136
I gotta tell you,
I've gone to war with a lot less.

12:29.945 --> 12:34.420
It would be fun
to nail those Argo bastards to the wall.

12:37.531 --> 12:41.906
- Wanna kick their asses?
- I believe so.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.884
Just once, I'd like to see you
sleep through the night.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.307
- Miss these great movies?
- They are on cassette.

13:08.381 --> 13:11.197
No, it's not the same.

13:11.262 --> 13:13.269
You're freezing.

13:16.318 --> 13:18.293
Michael.

13:21.311 --> 13:23.451
- Do you like me?
- What?

13:23.551 --> 13:25.526
- Do I like you?
- Yeah.

13:25.631 --> 13:28.698
- What kind of a question's that? Of course.
- Surprise.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.872
How can you not know that?

13:30.944 --> 13:34.654
How can I know that?
How can anybody?

13:34.753 --> 13:40.155
Tomorrow, if I did something you
really hated, would you still be here?

13:40.225 --> 13:42.232
Listen. Come here.

13:43.201 --> 13:46.911
Listen to me.
That's not the way these things work.

13:46.978 --> 13:49.280
I'm not your father.

13:49.347 --> 13:52.827
- This has nothing to do with him.
- Yes, it does.

13:52.899 --> 13:57.372
Maggie. I want this to work.
I really do.

13:57.475 --> 14:00.573
I trust you. And you want
to know if you can trust me.

14:02.628 --> 14:04.483
All right.

14:04.547 --> 14:09.022
Give this place up.
Live with me. Mm?

14:09.124 --> 14:13.434
No, Michael. We said we'd talk
about that after I make partner.

14:13.509 --> 14:16.804
- Maybe we need to talk about it now.
- No.

14:19.076 --> 14:23.780
It might help
but I'm just not ready to go public yet.

14:23.878 --> 14:27.424
You don't think they suspect?

14:27.527 --> 14:30.429
Suspecting is different
from being on the mailing list.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.121
- Who cares what they think?
- I do.

14:33.191 --> 14:36.803
- Why?
- Because it's different for a woman.

14:37.831 --> 14:44.161
I don't want them saying I made partner
for anything other than my work.

14:44.232 --> 14:47.549
Maybe I should be the one
asking how much you like me.

14:48.393 --> 14:50.726
No.

14:51.881 --> 14:53.157
Oh, no!

14:53.225 --> 14:56.357
No, come on.
One anxiety attack at a time.

14:56.425 --> 14:58.498
Your turn, is it?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.576
Oh, OK.

15:34.190 --> 15:37.038
- Who's Cyd Charisse?
- Deborah, your dad's new intern.

15:37.135 --> 15:39.687
- She's really great.
- Aren't they all?

15:39.758 --> 15:41.766
Ah, come on!

15:54.096 --> 15:56.551
Good luck with the school board.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.306
Luck I got. Votes I need. Thanks a lot.

15:59.408 --> 16:01.318
Mom! Hiya.

16:01.393 --> 16:06.182
Mom, come on. You're the bride. You're
supposed to be having a good time. Relax.

16:06.289 --> 16:10.348
- It's my petition. Are you having fun?
- Yeah, I haven't talked to Dad all evening.

16:10.449 --> 16:13.351
- Maggie!
- Maggie, be nice.

16:13.458 --> 16:17.287
- Maggie, I got one for you.
- Stop that.

16:17.362 --> 16:20.428
<i>Weems versus United States, 1910.
What was the issue?</i>

16:20.530 --> 16:23.117
Damn, a pop quiz
and me without a blue book.

16:23.219 --> 16:25.391
These are the easy ones. Come on!

16:25.491 --> 16:28.209
Cruel and unusual punishment.

16:28.276 --> 16:31.625
- They put a guy in chains for 15 years.
- That's absolutely right.

16:31.731 --> 16:35.115
- OK, so you do know everything.
- That's right also.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.602
Terrific, everybody's right.
Jed, why don't you and Maggie dance?

16:38.676 --> 16:44.045
You promised! Excuse me, but rumor
has it this used to be a party.

16:44.117 --> 16:46.189
- Come on, Nick, dance with me.
- All right.

16:46.293 --> 16:49.523
- Jed, dance with Maggie.
- All right, but you're a party pooper.

16:49.621 --> 16:51.378
- One more, one more.
- What?

16:51.445 --> 16:54.643
<i>1941. Kemper v Walden. Issue?</i>

16:59.319 --> 17:01.774
- Come on, issue!
- All right, all right.

17:01.847 --> 17:04.530
- Issue!
- All right, all right, wait!

17:04.598 --> 17:07.731
- I haven't the vaguest idea.
- The court ruled

17:07.800 --> 17:14.358
that children have the right
to sue their parents for nonperformance.

17:23.769 --> 17:27.696
The guy in the peach trunks, Nature Boy
Rick Flair, I represented him once.

17:27.769 --> 17:30.736
- He used to wrestle under the name of...
- Son of Satan.

17:30.809 --> 17:32.753
Son of Satan. Right.

17:32.858 --> 17:36.502
He had the horns, he had the pitch fork,
the whole shot.

17:36.570 --> 17:39.472
He had a great thing going
with a guy named the Angel of God.

17:39.579 --> 17:43.125
One morning, Satan wakes up
and he sees the light.

17:43.227 --> 17:46.424
Becomes a Born Again Christian.
Blows the whole rivalry.

17:46.492 --> 17:49.656
- What happened?
- Son of God goes berserk.

17:49.724 --> 17:53.369
- He sues my client for breach of contract.
- Did they have a contract?

17:53.468 --> 17:56.852
- He was imposing on my client's...
- Religious freedoms.

17:56.925 --> 17:58.747
- Can I talk to you?
- Just a minute.

17:58.812 --> 18:01.398
- Did you win?
- The judge threw us out of court.

18:01.501 --> 18:04.851
He thought it was a publicity stunt
and that we should go to hell.

18:04.925 --> 18:06.136
- Dad.
- What?

18:06.206 --> 18:08.116
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

18:08.222 --> 18:10.808
- See you guys.
- Sorry. Thanks.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.747
<i>This Walden versus Kemper.
Did you make that up?</i>

18:14.814 --> 18:16.919
Look it up, counselor.

18:17.023 --> 18:21.301
I wanted to ask you
about something about work.

18:21.375 --> 18:24.408
- You want to ask me about something?
- Yeah. I know.

18:24.511 --> 18:28.221
- You want my advice?
- It shocked the hell out of me.

18:28.288 --> 18:32.118
I've been offered a case.
A good case. Partnership time.

18:32.225 --> 18:36.601
- Why would you want to be a partner there?
- Dad, please! Don't make me sorry I asked.

18:36.705 --> 18:41.527
- Go ahead, ask. What's the problem?
- I get this look in your eye. For God's sake.

18:43.457 --> 18:47.865
OK. Anyway, it's a great case.
I know I could try the hell out of it.

18:47.938 --> 18:53.373
But I wonder if I should pass it up because
there's a pretty extreme conflict involved.

18:53.475 --> 18:56.257
- How extreme?
- They want me on Meridian.

18:59.300 --> 19:03.610
- So what's the problem?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

19:03.716 --> 19:07.099
It's obvious there's no problem.
You're not taking it.

19:07.173 --> 19:08.863
Oh, really? Just like that?

19:08.932 --> 19:12.413
Margaret, don't you see?
They're using you as a parlor trick.

19:12.517 --> 19:14.589
They think I'll see my precious daughter

19:14.661 --> 19:17.214
- and go all soft inside.
- It's a bit more than that.

19:17.317 --> 19:20.765
Will you think, Margaret?
You're an associate at Quinn Califan.

19:20.870 --> 19:26.304
They pop out baby lawyers like you, like
a shark grows teeth, row after row, forever.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.635
When it comes to the crunch,
they'll send in the big boys.

19:30.663 --> 19:33.565
They already did.

19:33.671 --> 19:35.165
You mean you?

19:36.519 --> 19:39.868
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be a very good attorney?

19:39.944 --> 19:43.773
- You damn well better be. I raised you.
- No! Mother raised me!

19:43.880 --> 19:45.888
You had a date.

19:45.992 --> 19:47.170
Sorry.

19:59.146 --> 20:02.113
I'm looking forward to it.
It's kinda funny.

20:02.185 --> 20:04.225
I don't see the humor.

20:06.315 --> 20:09.577
Fred Quinn thinks
he can rattle me with my daughter.

20:09.674 --> 20:12.675
What if she wins?

20:12.747 --> 20:17.351
Some day, maybe, but please
don't force me to be immodest.

20:17.419 --> 20:20.103
No one ever had to before.

20:20.203 --> 20:25.061
- Whose side are you on, anyway?
- Oh, Jed. Don't be an ass.

20:36.430 --> 20:39.430
- Absolute nonsense!
- What do you mean?

20:39.502 --> 20:44.237
You don't know what you're talking about!
What do you want me to do, buy her flowers?

20:44.303 --> 20:48.394
- She hates me!
- She doesn't hate you.

20:48.911 --> 20:50.984
She hates me, goddamnit.

20:51.823 --> 20:54.988
- I see it every time I look in her eyes.
- Oh, yeah?

20:55.088 --> 20:58.187
Yeah. I don't hate her
and I have every right to.

20:59.504 --> 21:02.853
Does it matter to her
that these cars are blowing up? No.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.500
Does it matter her that people...
babies are being killed? No.

21:07.601 --> 21:12.457
Does she care that she's in bed
with the vilest kind of corporate vermin?

21:12.562 --> 21:17.035
- I'm talking to you!
- No, you're not. You're talking to the jury.

21:17.106 --> 21:22.191
Listen, Jed. I love you dearly
but you are a superior, self-righteous bastard

21:22.290 --> 21:25.105
who's never satisfied
with anybody or anything.

21:25.203 --> 21:28.913
If I were Maggie,
I wouldn't want you to be my father either.

21:31.668 --> 21:35.662
- So I'm the bad guy here?
- Oh, I don't know.

21:35.764 --> 21:39.081
I should have locked
the two of you in a room years ago

21:39.156 --> 21:42.636
and not let you get out
until you'd kissed and made up.

21:42.708 --> 21:47.182
But I thought, in time,
you'd come to your senses.

21:47.286 --> 21:49.741
Boy, was I wrong.

21:49.845 --> 21:53.556
So now I spend my life
between two bickering children,

21:53.655 --> 21:57.516
both of whom are old enough to know better.

21:57.590 --> 21:59.598
Especially you.

22:03.799 --> 22:05.807
Margaret, I can take.

22:06.806 --> 22:12.144
A swine like Frederick Quinn,
no problem at all. But you...

22:12.248 --> 22:14.223
you rattle me.

22:16.151 --> 22:18.704
Stelli, I love you.

22:18.808 --> 22:24.309
You know me for the old codger that I am,
and you still hang around.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.792
I can't for the life of me understand why.

22:33.242 --> 22:35.512
Jed...

22:35.610 --> 22:39.408
this case will eventually go away.

22:42.620 --> 22:47.988
Please, please don't make her go away with it.

23:17.054 --> 23:19.030
Hi!

23:21.183 --> 23:23.420
Hi, how are you?

23:26.143 --> 23:28.631
Are you ready?

23:32.224 --> 23:35.094
Maggie, are you taking one for a test drive?

23:35.169 --> 23:37.341
I don't even have a learner's permit!

23:37.728 --> 23:40.892
You don't need one! On-the-job training.

23:41.409 --> 23:43.417
Very funny. Very funny.

23:46.402 --> 23:48.922
- So what's wrong?
- I didn't say a word.

23:49.026 --> 23:51.415
I know. And very loudly.

23:51.491 --> 23:53.857
OK.

23:53.923 --> 23:56.127
I'm worried, Maggie.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.617
I'd like you to drop the case.

24:02.788 --> 24:05.276
- Tell him to drop it. I dare you.
- He won't.

24:05.379 --> 24:08.227
- I dare you!
- You know he won't.

24:10.342 --> 24:13.920
This is the first time I have him
somewhere he doesn't make the rules,

24:14.021 --> 24:15.810
before ajudge in a courtroom.

24:15.909 --> 24:17.884
Someplace I can beat him.

24:17.988 --> 24:20.956
"Beat him"? He's your father, Maggie.

24:21.541 --> 24:23.745
So what?

24:23.813 --> 24:26.497
I am sick and tired of being afraid of him.

24:27.750 --> 24:32.258
All my life he's made me feel like
I wasn't good enough. Never mind if he was.

24:32.328 --> 24:35.643
He made some mistakes.
Thatjust makes him human.

24:35.751 --> 24:37.727
Too human.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.695
You of all people should know that.

24:41.767 --> 24:45.696
All of those women.
Were those mistakes?

24:45.768 --> 24:49.446
What happened between
your father and me is our concern.

24:49.545 --> 24:52.000
I think if I can put it behind me,
you should too.

24:52.105 --> 24:55.488
Well, I've tried. And I can't.

24:55.593 --> 24:59.337
Mom, I was there.
I saw how much he hurt you.

24:59.434 --> 25:01.890
Why didn't you just leave him?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.414
Come on, talk to me.

25:05.515 --> 25:09.224
About what you choose?
What about what I want?

25:09.290 --> 25:12.291
I won't drop this case. I won't!

25:12.395 --> 25:15.264
Somebody has to fight him. You didn't.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.208
Oh, Maggie, you never understood.

25:19.372 --> 25:21.379
Maybe that's my fault.

25:23.437 --> 25:26.568
Look, I had to make a choice with your father.

25:26.669 --> 25:28.709
It was a very hard choice.

25:28.781 --> 25:33.059
Sure I could have left.
God knows I thought about it.

25:33.134 --> 25:35.622
But I still love him.

25:35.695 --> 25:38.990
So I decided to stay and try to make it work.

25:40.014 --> 25:43.495
It took a long time,
but we got through it.

25:44.590 --> 25:49.893
And I honestly feel that I got
a lot more than I gave up by staying.

25:49.999 --> 25:54.157
And I still do,
whether you believe it or not.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.375
It's fine, Mom.

25:59.537 --> 26:01.676
You forgive him.

26:01.744 --> 26:04.494
You have a right to your choice.

26:04.593 --> 26:06.665
And I have a right to mine.

26:09.394 --> 26:14.347
We'll just be following you around
for a couple of days, videotaping you.

26:14.417 --> 26:18.642
The boat, the docks, trying to show what
your life has been like since the accident.

26:18.706 --> 26:21.357
My life, it is not so very interesting.

26:21.427 --> 26:24.906
When we show the jury the tape,
we think they'll find it very interesting.

26:24.978 --> 26:28.295
We want them to see what you've lost,
what you can't do any more.

26:28.402 --> 26:30.859
I cannot fish is what I cannot do.

26:30.963 --> 26:33.037
- It's good.
- It's good I cannot fish?

26:33.107 --> 26:36.556
No, no, Mr Minh. It's a terrible thing.

26:36.629 --> 26:40.240
We need to hear the stories
from all the Meridian owners who got hurt.

26:40.308 --> 26:44.565
- Mr Minh, I'd like to thank you...
- Who is this man with Mr Ward?

26:44.628 --> 26:46.636
That's Jack Tagallini.

26:46.709 --> 26:49.359
Mr Ward helped him,
just like he's gonna help you.

26:49.429 --> 26:51.819
Mr Ward, he must be very great man.

26:51.926 --> 26:54.512
A very great man.

26:54.582 --> 26:57.899
Now, listen.
You take care. We'll be in touch.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.982
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

27:01.206 --> 27:04.916
- Pretty severe burns.
- But his English! The jury won't understand.

27:04.983 --> 27:08.562
So we shoot the video.
If it doesn't play, we lose him.

27:08.631 --> 27:09.580
Who's next?

27:13.560 --> 27:17.838
We'll go right to the summary proceedings.

27:19.449 --> 27:21.554
- How do I look?
- Nervous.

27:21.625 --> 27:24.724
- Why?
- You have Pepto-Bismol on your mouth.

27:24.793 --> 27:28.143
- Maggie!
- Hi. Hi.

27:31.673 --> 27:33.617
Are we still friends?

27:33.722 --> 27:36.341
What do you think?

27:36.443 --> 27:40.600
Don't worry about me, Margaret.
I'm just your old decrepit father.

27:40.667 --> 27:42.161
Be strong. Come on.

27:43.484 --> 27:47.029
Your Honor, it's about evidence.
Plaintiff doesn't have any.

27:47.131 --> 27:51.354
The only reasonable course of action
is to grant my client summary judgment.

27:51.452 --> 27:54.322
- Denied.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

27:56.027 --> 27:58.036
Next case.

28:02.077 --> 28:05.623
Case no. 861947,

28:05.724 --> 28:09.041
<i>Kellen et al. versus Argo Motors.</i>

28:10.334 --> 28:13.433
For the plaintiffs, Jedediah Tucker Ward.

28:13.535 --> 28:15.509
For the defense, Margaret Eleanor Ward.

28:15.615 --> 28:19.194
I'm glad I'm not going to be
at your house for the holidays.

28:22.912 --> 28:26.043
I presume the proper waivers
have been signed here.

28:27.007 --> 28:30.324
- They have, Your Honor.
- OK, what have you got for me?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.953
The court has before it a discovery motion

28:33.057 --> 28:36.603
compelling the defendant to supply
the names and current addresses

28:36.673 --> 28:42.205
of all Argo employees involved in designing
the Meridian model, between 1980 and 1985.

28:42.273 --> 28:43.801
Response, Miss Ward.

28:43.875 --> 28:48.479
It doesn't deserve one.
This is a bald-faced fishing expedition.

28:48.578 --> 28:54.241
People who worked on the car design might
have something interesting to say about it.

28:54.339 --> 28:59.128
Your Honor, if my esteemed colleague
had the vaguest idea what he was looking for,

28:59.203 --> 29:03.164
he could narrow his discovery
to something smaller than the phone book.

29:03.235 --> 29:06.334
Miss Ward, I think he deserves something.

29:06.404 --> 29:09.274
What he's asking for is out of the question.

29:09.380 --> 29:14.717
Some of the people haven't worked for Argo
for years. They've scattered to the four winds.

29:14.822 --> 29:18.203
Generating a current address list
could take thousands of hours.

29:21.125 --> 29:25.316
- We will give him the names.
- Mr Ward?

29:25.413 --> 29:27.169
That's a start, Your Honor.

29:27.237 --> 29:34.363
The job descriptions and the names are not
of much value without the current addresses.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.084
Mr Ward, in all fairness,
I think Miss Ward has proved

29:38.184 --> 29:41.796
that supplying the addresses
would put an undue burden on the defense.

29:41.896 --> 29:46.533
I was concerned about that, too, Your Honor,
so I called the pension department at Argo.

29:46.601 --> 29:49.895
Told them I had a former friend
I was looking for named John Smith.

29:49.961 --> 29:53.377
Did they have anybody by that name
who worked for the company? They did.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.581
Called him up on the computer
and gave me his current address.

29:58.889 --> 30:02.119
- Really?
- An illegal invasion of privacy!

30:02.218 --> 30:04.902
They keep an updated record
of all former employees

30:04.971 --> 30:08.004
- to send them their pension statements.
- Your Honor...

30:08.107 --> 30:11.937
They asked me if I worked with him
at Argo and where did I live,

30:12.011 --> 30:15.394
and then they sent me this current newsletter.

30:16.971 --> 30:19.361
It wasn't hard at all, Your Honor.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.444
I want those addresses.

30:22.732 --> 30:25.766
- A cheap sideshow trick.
- It worked.

30:25.869 --> 30:30.026
- Because Symes is a sucker for your antics.
- Lighten up. I'll buy you an ice cream.

30:30.093 --> 30:32.264
- Oh, Jed, cut it out.
- Estelle, shush.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.406
No! Now, listen. No more.

30:34.573 --> 30:36.516
No. There's a lot more.

30:36.622 --> 30:38.890
This is just the beginning.

30:41.711 --> 30:45.770
- She used to like ice cream.
- She used to like you.

30:50.511 --> 30:52.486
I know.

30:53.455 --> 30:57.482
I know, Michael. You don't have
to try to make me feel better.

30:57.584 --> 31:01.478
It's just this thing
is gonna slow us up so much.

31:08.657 --> 31:10.348
Maggie.

31:10.417 --> 31:13.003
Maggie! Maggie!

31:19.633 --> 31:22.668
One, two, three, four, five.

31:23.475 --> 31:26.377
One, two, three, four, five.

31:27.571 --> 31:29.579
Mom.

31:29.747 --> 31:32.682
Is there a doctor? Call the doctor!

31:33.107 --> 31:35.082
Mom!

32:45.114 --> 32:51.225
1954, I was watching the McCarthy
hearings on television.

32:55.068 --> 32:58.549
I had trouble keeping my mind
on the testimony.

32:58.621 --> 33:03.225
There was this beautiful young woman
sitting in the first row of the gallery.

33:03.325 --> 33:09.588
Every time the camera would catch her
in the background, she was doing this.

33:14.463 --> 33:16.372
I was fascinated.

33:16.479 --> 33:19.326
I watched for hours,
trying to catch sight of her.

33:19.391 --> 33:24.148
Finally, I couldn't stand it any longer.
I called the hearing room.

33:24.224 --> 33:26.232
Had the guard...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.717
ask her if she would call me during recess.

33:30.784 --> 33:36.284
Amazingly enough, she did. I introduced
myself and asked her what she was doing.

33:36.352 --> 33:41.569
She said she was mouthing the words
"McCarthy is a weasel. "

33:44.770 --> 33:48.512
Subliminal advertising, she called it.

33:48.610 --> 33:54.939
She said it would stick in people's minds
forever and no matter what, she claimed,

33:55.043 --> 33:57.019
it would sway the deaf vote.

33:59.908 --> 34:04.512
I got on the next plane
and we were married a month later.

34:08.389 --> 34:15.646
I'm sure wherever Stelli is now, there are
12 guys better than me chasing her around.

34:15.717 --> 34:21.184
But if you have a moment,
I just have this to say.

34:21.284 --> 34:23.839
Remember please forever that I love you.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.047
Don't be late for work.

34:52.328 --> 34:54.304
You OK?

34:57.802 --> 34:59.809
I've been better.

35:03.178 --> 35:06.048
- How's it going in there?
- It's going OK.

35:06.123 --> 35:09.669
- People have started to leave.
- Good.

35:10.923 --> 35:12.931
You need something?

35:16.076 --> 35:18.727
- A priest.
- Yeah.

35:18.796 --> 35:22.724
Somebody I could confess to.
Somebody who'd tell me it wasn't my fault.

35:22.796 --> 35:25.666
It wasn't your fault.

35:25.772 --> 35:29.668
Maggie, she shot an embolism.
These things take years.

35:29.773 --> 35:32.391
They build up...

35:32.493 --> 35:34.882
No, but then I took this case.

35:37.325 --> 35:41.581
You know, Nick, all my life,
whatever I wanted, she was always there.

35:41.646 --> 35:45.640
She's always been there for us and
the one time she asked me to do something...

35:45.743 --> 35:47.718
No, no, no. Come on.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.557
You can't blame yourself for that.

35:53.615 --> 35:57.031
That's not what she would have wanted.

35:57.135 --> 35:59.372
OK?

35:59.440 --> 36:01.416
Yeah.

36:02.416 --> 36:03.977
- I gotta go home.
- No.

36:04.049 --> 36:09.167
I think what you gotta do is stay here
and be here with your father.

36:09.265 --> 36:11.883
He'll be fine, Nick.
He's got you.

36:11.985 --> 36:15.335
He's got me, yeah, but he needs you.

36:15.410 --> 36:17.679
He needs you, Maggie.

36:17.778 --> 36:19.502
Nick!

36:22.259 --> 36:24.331
Laura's looking for you.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.901
Take your dish.

36:32.212 --> 36:34.317
Thanks for coming.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.394
See you.

36:46.581 --> 36:49.648
I never knew she kept this.

36:51.189 --> 36:53.743
My jelly-jar glass.

36:54.390 --> 36:59.180
Do you remember when she boycotted grape
jelly in sympathy with the farm workers?

37:00.022 --> 37:04.146
Yeah. And all I'd eat was peanut butter
and grape jelly sandwiches.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.350
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37:07.415 --> 37:10.450
I solved the problem, though.
Or at least I thought I did.

37:10.552 --> 37:14.382
I found a grape jelly without
any grapes in it. All chemicals.

37:15.512 --> 37:20.149
- She'd never let you eat that.
- No. But it put her in a moral dilemma.

37:20.217 --> 37:23.567
Should she satisfy a demanding child
with an affront to human rights

37:23.673 --> 37:25.528
or cop out to toxic sludge?

37:26.970 --> 37:30.418
- What did she do?
- She introduced me to marmalade.

37:32.058 --> 37:34.328
Hey, Jed. Give a call.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.565
OK. Thanks.

37:41.851 --> 37:43.858
What a mess.

37:45.787 --> 37:49.366
Your mom was always
in charge of organization.

38:12.031 --> 38:14.900
She had a dental appointment today?

38:40.481 --> 38:44.573
- How fast was that, Dr Getchell?
- 30mph.

38:47.266 --> 38:51.260
That's amazing.
Just amazing.

38:53.442 --> 38:57.698
Isn't that amazing, Maggie?
All that damage forjust going 30.

38:57.795 --> 38:59.583
Yeah.

38:59.684 --> 39:05.979
Well, there's gonna be damage till
we can figure out a way to make cars bounce.

39:13.349 --> 39:17.210
- Do you test every model this way?
- Every model, every year.

39:17.317 --> 39:19.260
Feds say we got to.

39:19.365 --> 39:23.588
Course, this is only one test.
We do 77 others.

39:23.686 --> 39:25.662
Don't want no surprises.

39:26.662 --> 39:29.477
That's what gets my goat
about this damn lawsuit.

39:29.542 --> 39:32.892
What you got here is just about
the safest damn car on the road.

39:32.999 --> 39:35.235
- You'll say that on the stand?
- Hell, yes.

39:35.303 --> 39:37.311
But don't stop with me.

39:38.952 --> 39:41.668
- What's this?
- Meridian performance charts.

39:41.767 --> 39:46.405
The '85 model exceeded
every federal standard that year.

39:46.473 --> 39:48.479
- Plus...
- Plus?

39:48.681 --> 39:51.550
- Plus Rowena.
- Who's Rowena?

39:51.625 --> 39:53.447
Not who. What.

39:53.514 --> 39:57.060
An independent research facility.
The car passed every test.

40:05.225 --> 40:10.278
- I can't find my keys.
- You're late. I need you to chop ze onions.

40:10.347 --> 40:14.503
- Aren't we going out for dinner?
- No, I'm making your mom's menudo.

40:14.603 --> 40:16.579
You're cooking?

40:19.596 --> 40:23.687
- How many tablespoons in a teaspoon?
- Do I look like a calculator?

40:23.755 --> 40:27.750
- Maybe I should make something.
- Oh ho ho! No, thank you.

40:27.851 --> 40:29.827
I prefer to die in ze bed.

40:32.397 --> 40:35.844
Is this supposed to look like this?

40:35.917 --> 40:38.122
- Jesus!
- What?

40:38.190 --> 40:40.524
No, nothing.

40:40.589 --> 40:43.852
So I just left everything the way it was.

40:43.951 --> 40:46.285
- Have you finished?
- Yeah.

40:46.350 --> 40:52.013
- Not bad for a couple of lawyers.
- Yeah, it wasn't your mother's but...

40:52.079 --> 40:56.553
- It was great.
- I just wanted some of her smell around.

40:59.151 --> 41:02.730
I got some of your mom's things packed up.
I figured you might like 'em.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.004
- Yes. Yes.
- Wanna see 'em?

41:07.216 --> 41:09.933
Oh, no. Oh my God!

41:10.000 --> 41:12.488
Look at all your hair!

41:14.578 --> 41:20.013
You had a beautiful mother, Magpie.
Look at that. My God.

41:20.370 --> 41:22.671
Magpie?

41:22.771 --> 41:25.836
You haven't called me that since...
I must have been 12.

41:25.938 --> 41:28.524
Yeah.

41:28.595 --> 41:30.896
- The prettiest, smartest...
- Yeah.

41:30.962 --> 41:33.864
...mouthiest kid.

41:38.484 --> 41:42.675
- Ah, the People's Park Festival.
- Oh, yeah.

41:42.772 --> 41:44.528
- 1967, '68.
- Yeah.

41:56.885 --> 41:59.253
They don't make marches like they used to.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.457
Do you remember this?

42:01.526 --> 42:07.604
No, only what I read in the paper.
You left Mom and me at home. Of course.

42:07.702 --> 42:09.711
I'd just turned 13.

42:10.615 --> 42:14.260
My first boyfriend had dumped me.
And I could have used you.

42:14.904 --> 42:18.200
Young love was always
your mother's line, Margaret.

42:18.297 --> 42:21.493
I was busy trying to keep
the planet in one piece.

42:21.561 --> 42:23.447
Burning a few bras in the process.

42:23.544 --> 42:25.934
I was more interested
in burning draft cards.

42:26.008 --> 42:29.555
Really? I thought you were more
interested in the women's movement.

42:31.002 --> 42:36.370
Relationships were more casual
in those days. It was just more open.

42:36.442 --> 42:40.054
Oh, please!
I'm so tired of the '60s crap.

42:40.123 --> 42:42.807
I was on the road for six,
nine months at a time.

42:42.907 --> 42:46.104
None of this ever meant anything to me.

42:48.443 --> 42:51.543
Not even Alice Worth?

43:02.813 --> 43:05.627
So that's it? Case dismissed?

43:05.693 --> 43:10.964
- You're out of order, counselor.
- And you are guilty as charged.

43:13.022 --> 43:15.324
Alice Worth was my law partner.

43:15.422 --> 43:19.797
Oh, please, Dad!
You think I didn't know?

43:19.903 --> 43:24.541
- This is none of your business, goddamnit!
- Alice Worth was very much my business!

43:24.607 --> 43:28.536
She wasn'tjust some nameless one-nighter.

43:28.608 --> 43:33.245
Alice was a friend.
She was Mom's friend. Mine.

43:33.888 --> 43:39.072
She was everything I wanted to be.
She was smart and beautiful and a lawyer.

43:39.136 --> 43:44.090
I used to follow her around in here, to watch
how she'd cross her legs or hold her drink,

43:44.192 --> 43:46.299
and then Mom finds her letters to you.

43:51.137 --> 43:54.848
She never cried in front of me.
She wouldn't do that.

43:54.947 --> 43:57.500
But when she thought I was asleep,
I could hear her.

43:57.570 --> 44:00.538
Alone in her room,
sometimes three, four in the morning.

44:01.380 --> 44:07.872
- I'm really tired of this ancient history.
- She was never the same after that!

44:07.971 --> 44:10.143
Something in her eyes went dead.

44:10.212 --> 44:14.141
Margaret, you have to know
that I was committed to your mother.

44:14.213 --> 44:19.298
No. In one fell swoop,
you took away the woman I admired,

44:19.397 --> 44:22.299
the mother I knew
and the father I believed in.

44:23.237 --> 44:26.586
The conscience of America.
Defender of the huddled masses!

44:26.661 --> 44:29.312
The only thing you cared
about the huddled masses

44:29.383 --> 44:31.936
was how tall you could stand
on their shoulders!

44:32.039 --> 44:34.941
- Wait a minute. There's more to this...
- I'm going.

44:35.014 --> 44:37.797
- Wait. I spent my life trying to help people.
- Oh, yeah?

44:37.864 --> 44:41.954
Got any thank-you notes
from Jack Tagallini recently?

44:42.022 --> 44:44.837
Margaret! I had nothing to do with that.

44:44.903 --> 44:47.555
Oh, yeah?
I think you're being a little modest.

44:47.624 --> 44:50.375
Before you met Jack Tagallini,
he was just a nice guy,

44:50.473 --> 44:52.993
pissed off at the cost
overruns at Zembella Air.

44:53.064 --> 44:57.156
- It never occurred to him to go public.
- He didn't know how. I had to show him how.

44:57.225 --> 45:02.114
<i>You forced him! Or conned him! Or whatever
it is you do to get on the cover of Newsweek.</i>

45:02.185 --> 45:05.000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

45:05.065 --> 45:09.702
<i>I was on the cover of Newsweek
because I was right. Goddamnit!</i>

45:09.802 --> 45:14.440
Thatjury was out for two hours and 27
minutes. They gave us every single point.

45:14.508 --> 45:17.158
But what about Jack Tagallini?

45:17.227 --> 45:21.156
You turned him into a whistle-blower
without telling him what it would cost.

45:21.227 --> 45:24.261
He lost his job, all of his friends,
his professional life.

45:24.364 --> 45:29.220
That case changed the law! It affects
every single person who gets on an airplane.

45:29.324 --> 45:31.910
- You stopped taking his calls.
- I helped him.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.348
- No, you dumped him!
- The world keeps turning.

45:34.445 --> 45:36.616
I had other people to help.

45:36.716 --> 45:38.059
You dumped him!

45:39.661 --> 45:41.833
I couldn't hold his fucking hand, OK?

45:41.902 --> 45:45.796
No, you didn't hold a hand unless
it was young, female and attractive!

45:45.870 --> 45:48.936
You're a user, Dad.
You used Tagallini and all those women

45:49.038 --> 45:51.460
and you used Mom!

45:52.303 --> 45:54.376
Goddamned hypocrite.

45:55.567 --> 45:57.542
How dare you question my behavior?

45:57.648 --> 46:01.325
You, whose claim to fame is being
one of Quinn Califan's young Nazis.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.465
My clients don't blow their brains out.

46:03.569 --> 46:07.180
- If your mother could hear you now...
- She can't, can she?

46:07.279 --> 46:11.623
She got outta here. Wherever she is, she's
gotta be happier than when she was with you.

46:16.529 --> 46:20.840
So, finally... words fail
the great Jedediah Tucker Ward.

46:20.914 --> 46:22.921
You get...

46:44.532 --> 46:46.507
Maggie!

46:47.125 --> 46:49.100
Maggie.

47:01.238 --> 47:06.541
I heard you were having dinner with
your father. I figured you could use a friend.

47:06.647 --> 47:08.621
Oh, Michael.

47:28.473 --> 47:30.545
Mr Quinn is ready for you.

47:31.993 --> 47:33.554
Thank you, Sally.

47:34.779 --> 47:36.851
Maggie. Come in.

47:36.922 --> 47:38.929
Thank you.

47:40.091 --> 47:42.328
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

47:42.395 --> 47:46.706
- You look tired.
- No, well, I'm fine.

47:46.812 --> 47:51.929
When my mother died... Well, I know
how long it can take to get over.

47:51.996 --> 47:55.160
- With the workload you're carrying...
- I'll manage.

47:55.260 --> 47:59.635
I want to believe that.
But in looking over this transcript,

47:59.740 --> 48:02.938
I'm worried about
the Steven Kellen deposition.

48:03.004 --> 48:07.577
No. It's all completely under control.
He's wearing down.

48:07.645 --> 48:13.363
If he gets into court in that wheelchair
with this story, he'll be far too sympathetic.

48:13.438 --> 48:17.748
- I understand that, Mr Quinn.
- I can't put this in strong enough terms.

48:17.854 --> 48:21.018
I want him eliminated
as an effective witness.

48:21.086 --> 48:22.232
Yes, sir.

48:23.007 --> 48:26.803
- Are you prepared to do that?
- Absolutely.

48:32.703 --> 48:34.646
Then you won't mind if I sit in?

48:35.136 --> 48:37.373
No. No.

48:38.657 --> 48:39.966
Great.

48:40.257 --> 48:45.592
Now, Mr Kellen, when the paramedics
were pulling you out of the vehicle,

48:45.921 --> 48:48.223
how did it feel to be on fire?

48:48.385 --> 48:51.003
For Godsakes,
you just asked me that question.

48:51.105 --> 48:54.488
No, sir, I believe I asked you
if you remembered being on fire.

48:54.562 --> 48:57.377
And I asked you,
when did you know you were on fire?

48:57.442 --> 49:01.535
And now I'm asking,
how did it feel to be on fire?

49:01.603 --> 49:02.497
It was...

49:02.563 --> 49:06.075
Maggie, I'm warning you,
we are already halfway out the door here.

49:06.179 --> 49:11.897
Mr Kellen, were you ever a patient
of a Dr Maxwell Chastain?

49:13.988 --> 49:15.963
Maybe. So?

49:16.741 --> 49:18.715
Yes or no, please.

49:18.821 --> 49:19.836
Yes.

49:19.942 --> 49:24.546
Is Dr Chastain a psychologist
specializing in car phobias?

49:25.541 --> 49:27.931
- Is he, Mr Kellen?
- Yes.

49:28.646 --> 49:31.843
As I understand it, a car phobia
means you're afraid of driving. True?

49:33.190 --> 49:35.842
It's not as simple as that.

49:35.943 --> 49:38.529
What's not simple?
Whether it's true or it's false?

49:39.910 --> 49:40.926
I guess it's true.

49:41.031 --> 49:43.487
Which makes you cautious,
maybe too cautious?

49:43.592 --> 49:46.461
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Noted.

49:46.535 --> 49:48.924
The car blew up.
How can you be too cautious?

49:49.032 --> 49:52.000
Technically, it burst into flames.

49:54.696 --> 49:59.269
Prior to the accident, how many times
have you been cited for driving too slow?

49:59.338 --> 50:02.884
- Twice.
- Are you sure it wasn't three times?

50:02.986 --> 50:06.696
Here we have December of '81,
August of '83, then again in October.

50:06.794 --> 50:08.801
Objection. This is beyond the scope...

50:08.907 --> 50:12.104
Have you had any other accidents
in the last five years?

50:12.171 --> 50:15.619
- Don't answer that.
- If he doesn't, he answers in front of ajury.

50:15.691 --> 50:19.170
Look, they weren't my fault.
Other people hit me.

50:19.274 --> 50:22.177
- I wonder why.
- Do you really?

50:22.251 --> 50:25.929
- Do you even care what happened?
- I know what happened, Mr Kellen.

50:26.028 --> 50:29.858
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no. My God.

50:29.932 --> 50:32.583
And so do you.

50:32.653 --> 50:36.548
I don't believe this, I don't believe this.

50:36.621 --> 50:38.564
We're out of here. Come on.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.867
Who the hell do you think you are?
This wasn't my fault.

50:41.933 --> 50:44.869
- This deposition is finished.
- Are you fucking human?

50:44.942 --> 50:46.981
Do you care, Miss Ward, about anybody?

50:47.054 --> 50:49.259
Nick, please.

50:56.655 --> 50:58.663
Nice pictures. Real nice.

51:03.633 --> 51:07.431
What's a good set of 8"x 10"s cost
these days? 10, 15 bucks?

51:09.553 --> 51:12.302
This is important, Fred.

51:12.401 --> 51:15.151
What's the going rate
for a man's dignity, huh?

51:15.217 --> 51:18.185
You stole his wife, his kid, his body.

51:18.258 --> 51:22.731
Now I guess you spend another 10 or 15
dollars and get the whole package?

51:22.834 --> 51:27.374
That's what this is about, money. He's after
your money and you're out to protect it.

51:27.475 --> 51:30.509
Well, you hold onto it real tight

51:30.578 --> 51:35.118
because without a heart and soul,
that's all you'll ever have.

51:39.124 --> 51:42.833
Jed, we have angles like this
on all your people.

51:42.900 --> 51:46.577
Bottom line, you don't want to try this case.

51:52.598 --> 51:55.533
Kellen had me out there,
buck naked in a hailstorm.

51:55.638 --> 51:59.282
I need better information from you.
We got four weeks before the trial.

51:59.350 --> 52:02.732
- 242 people worked on the design of that car.
- I know this.

52:02.838 --> 52:06.865
So there are 242 chances
for you people to do something right.

52:06.966 --> 52:12.117
- Most of them don't wanna talk with us.
- That's just excuses.

52:12.183 --> 52:16.112
Hold on a second. You always go on about
the great David and Goliath cases.

52:16.184 --> 52:18.901
It seems you've forgotten
how hard the David work is.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.914
We have worked very hard. If you cannot
see that, maybe we aren't the problem here.

52:54.500 --> 52:56.671
What do you think?

52:57.380 --> 52:59.356
It needs something.

53:00.196 --> 53:01.276
Olive.

53:03.460 --> 53:05.435
Overstated.

53:08.419 --> 53:12.249
- I'm Ray.
- I'm Maggie.

53:12.962 --> 53:15.483
Maggie. What do you do?

53:16.355 --> 53:18.363
Me?

53:20.035 --> 53:22.905
I'm a professional killer.

53:24.420 --> 53:27.290
- Do you like your work?
- Yes and no.

53:28.613 --> 53:32.574
See, it's long hours.

53:33.380 --> 53:36.346
And there's a lot of stress.

53:36.451 --> 53:40.128
But when you finally put your head
on the pillow at night,

53:40.196 --> 53:42.814
there's this warm feeling
you get from knowing

53:42.883 --> 53:45.951
you tore at least
one person's heart out that day.

53:51.812 --> 53:53.786
I'm a lawyer.

53:56.004 --> 53:58.012
I think you've had enough.

53:59.140 --> 54:03.448
Ray, there's never enough.

54:12.580 --> 54:17.249
Yeah, but my question is, do they count
their time in bed together as billable hours?

54:17.317 --> 54:19.706
Sure. At Grazier's rate.

54:19.812 --> 54:23.641
Maggie's the associate
so I assume she does all the work.

54:23.716 --> 54:28.801
- Especially the oral argument.
- What about oral arguments?

54:30.021 --> 54:32.092
It's just a case we heard about.

54:32.164 --> 54:34.553
Drilling rights.

54:34.660 --> 54:36.995
Maggie, you didn't go home
last night, did you?

54:37.092 --> 54:39.297
It's a month before trial.

54:39.397 --> 54:43.772
The list of people that worked on
the Meridian, wasn't there a Pavel?

54:43.845 --> 54:47.008
Yeah, he was one of
the research guys. Why?

54:47.077 --> 54:50.907
It's just a weird thing in Getchell's file.

54:52.292 --> 54:58.586
A commendation letter to Getchell,
from Flannery who was the CEO back then.

54:59.364 --> 55:03.357
Blah blah blah, usual hype. Then it says
"Please accept my gratitude and thanks

55:03.460 --> 55:06.362
for keeping Pavel and the Meridian
issue in the family. "

55:06.436 --> 55:10.714
It's signed at the beginning
of the 1985 model year.

55:11.365 --> 55:13.372
So?

55:13.861 --> 55:17.157
So, what "issue"?

55:21.956 --> 55:25.272
Could be something.
I wanna talk to him.

55:29.444 --> 55:30.905
Thank you.

56:41.733 --> 56:44.286
Do you want a rabbit?

56:44.357 --> 56:48.732
They are the best ones.
I even got them toilet trained.

56:48.805 --> 56:50.659
- Dr Pavel?
- Yes?

56:50.724 --> 56:55.547
I'm Margaret Ward. My law firm was in
contact with you and said I'd be stopping by.

56:55.653 --> 56:57.083
And?

56:57.158 --> 56:59.776
I'd like to talk to you
about some research you did

56:59.846 --> 57:02.846
while you were working
at Argo on the Meridian.

57:02.917 --> 57:05.218
What Meridian?

57:05.285 --> 57:10.370
A car. You did extensive research
on its electrical system.

57:10.437 --> 57:12.642
It was project 0243.

57:14.885 --> 57:17.405
I'm no longer good with numbers.

57:17.477 --> 57:20.827
It was a 1985 model, station wagon,

57:20.934 --> 57:24.317
and you said there were problems with it.

57:29.286 --> 57:32.417
- The depth charge!
- Excuse me?

57:32.486 --> 57:35.967
That's what I called it, the depth charge.

57:37.382 --> 57:40.676
Herbert, stop flirting with the lady.

57:41.925 --> 57:45.951
- Depth charge, sir, is...
- You want to know about the circuits.

57:46.053 --> 57:48.508
Yeah, yeah. OK.

57:51.046 --> 57:54.658
- I saved their ass on that one.
- Really? How?

57:54.726 --> 57:59.036
- There was this guy. A hillbilly.
- Hillbilly?

57:59.142 --> 58:02.338
- What's his name?
- You mean Getchell? George Getchell?

58:02.406 --> 58:05.221
That's the one.
Getchell, that's the name.

58:05.287 --> 58:08.286
He was your supervisor for 16 years.

58:15.621 --> 58:20.772
16 years.
Just testing, testing, testing.

58:20.838 --> 58:25.792
Did you know that whatshisname designed
the circuit and I was supposed to test it?

58:25.895 --> 58:28.578
But he said "Alexander Pavel,
leave it alone. "

58:28.646 --> 58:35.203
"We've already tooled up for it
on the assembly line. The circuit is OK."

58:35.302 --> 58:37.276
That's what he said.

58:38.917 --> 58:40.925
But I am a scientist.

58:41.318 --> 58:43.838
I test it anyway on my own.

58:43.942 --> 58:46.910
I like to mix things.

58:47.878 --> 58:50.017
I like to see how things combine.

58:54.022 --> 58:55.996
The circuit was OK...

58:58.054 --> 59:03.006
until I started hitting the car
when the left-turn signal was flashing.

59:03.078 --> 59:05.925
Then...

59:06.023 --> 59:07.997
Depth charge.

59:09.382 --> 59:12.481
- It blew up?
- It blew up.

59:13.318 --> 59:15.523
The Meridian blew up?

59:16.997 --> 59:19.005
Yeah.

59:20.102 --> 59:23.681
You see, where there's
an impact of metal on metal.

59:27.623 --> 59:32.805
In this area,
the devices are maybe 50-75cm apart.

59:35.463 --> 59:39.718
If there's an arc
in the flow of the circuit...

59:39.815 --> 59:40.797
Yeah.

59:40.901 --> 59:44.318
Just as it's penetrating
the electrical fuel pump,

59:44.424 --> 59:47.685
then the gas tank will blow up.

59:47.783 --> 59:51.711
It's just a simple chain reaction.

59:51.814 --> 59:56.418
So you're saying that,
if the car is hit from the rear,

59:56.487 --> 01:00:00.283
when the left-turn signal is functioning,

01:00:00.358 --> 01:00:02.431
itjust might blow up.

01:00:02.534 --> 01:00:03.516
Correct.

01:00:05.096 --> 01:00:09.437
If you are really interested in this,
why don't you read my report?

01:00:09.543 --> 01:00:11.234
And let's have a coffee.

01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:13.222
The report...

01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:16.670
When you filed this report,
did you give a copy to Getchell?

01:00:16.775 --> 01:00:20.004
- To the company.
- May I see another copy?

01:00:20.103 --> 01:00:22.657
No, the company has it, of course.

01:00:22.728 --> 01:00:24.897
- The company has everything?
- Yep.

01:00:24.966 --> 01:00:27.966
Except my notes.

01:00:28.037 --> 01:00:30.045
- You do have notes?
- Of course.

01:00:30.118 --> 01:00:32.966
- May I see those, please?
- No.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:34.045
No?

01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:38.396
If you want my notes,
you need to go to Iron Mountain.

01:00:40.264 --> 01:00:42.118
Sugar?

01:00:48.198 --> 01:00:50.021
Thank you.

01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:04.612
Miller's left the office.
You want me to try him at home?

01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:07.068
No, no.

01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:11.234
I think I should have died
the day Nixon resigned.

01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:15.202
Look at this. See? Look.

01:01:16.199 --> 01:01:18.206
See this? This guy here.

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:28.321
How about I make you
some dinner at my place?

01:01:34.407 --> 01:01:36.961
No. Thank you, but...

01:01:40.776 --> 01:01:42.751
I'm really not very hungry.

01:01:42.856 --> 01:01:44.830
So...

01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:48.165
Anyway, listen. I think
I found something pretty interesting.

01:01:48.264 --> 01:01:49.246
What's that?

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.872
A commendation letter
from Flannery to Getchell.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:54.910
Do you remember an Argo research guy,
Alexander Pavel?

01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:56.444
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

01:02:23.816 --> 01:02:25.790
Thank God.

01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:37.248
I don't know.
Maggie, we're talking about Argo Motors.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.214
- They have guys who research everything.
- Not everything.

01:02:41.287 --> 01:02:45.477
A glitch that takes three or four things
to happen simultaneously could slip by.

01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:48.891
I get Getchell to come clean.
We settle quietly out of court.

01:02:48.967 --> 01:02:51.815
Argo Motors kisses my feet
for avoiding a public scandal.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.104
Maybe, maybe.
Then again, maybe Pavel is a nut bar.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.890
Maybe.

01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:04.574
I grant you, these days, the guy
is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:07.517
But somebody was at home
when that report was made.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.113
Mr Getchell is returning your call.

01:03:10.216 --> 01:03:12.998
Oh, it's our good buddy from Argo!

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:16.195
- Dr Getchell.
- Miss Ward, how are you?

01:03:16.295 --> 01:03:21.380
I'm fine, sir. How would you
like to discuss Alexander Pavel?

01:03:23.336 --> 01:03:26.183
Alexander Pavel is a senile old fool.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.127
So you didn't take his advice
on the blinker circuit?

01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:31.614
I decided his test results were inconclusive

01:03:31.688 --> 01:03:36.358
and informed Mr Flannery,
the chief executive officer at the time.

01:03:36.456 --> 01:03:38.822
People were blown up, sir.

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:41.888
We changed that light in the next model year.

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:44.293
I suggest you get an attorney.

01:03:44.359 --> 01:03:46.661
I've already talked to one.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:51.934
It was right at the time the report came out.
He said we had nothing to worry about.

01:03:52.009 --> 01:03:54.082
What idiot told you that?

01:03:54.185 --> 01:03:56.837
If I'm not mistaken, he's your boss.

01:03:56.937 --> 01:03:58.911
Michael Grazier.

01:04:02.344 --> 01:04:04.319
Miss Ward? Are you there?

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:08.259
What? What did he say?

01:04:09.576 --> 01:04:12.162
Maggie?

01:04:15.144 --> 01:04:20.612
It was a rough time.
I was buried, working on 50 things at once.

01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:26.848
It got lost in the shuffle.

01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:30.849
You gave advice on something
you hadn't reviewed.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.309
I mistook it for another report.

01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:35.456
Why didn't you tell somebody?

01:04:35.529 --> 01:04:41.158
Well, Quinn had just made me liaison
with Argo's in-house counselor.

01:04:41.257 --> 01:04:43.198
That was a huge plum.

01:04:43.304 --> 01:04:46.599
If I did it well, they were gonna
give me all of Argo's litigation.

01:04:46.697 --> 01:04:49.379
Not a good time to appear sloppy.

01:04:55.528 --> 01:04:57.535
Now what?

01:04:59.784 --> 01:05:01.956
We have to lose it.

01:05:07.047 --> 01:05:10.048
I am not going to be a party
to destroying evidence.

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:18.559
Maggie, Argo paid this firm a little over
8 million dollars in fees last year.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:20.640
Do you want to jeopardize that?

01:05:20.745 --> 01:05:24.127
We'd hurt ourselves and the client.
It would compound the mistake.

01:05:24.201 --> 01:05:27.496
- Michael, people were killed!
- Yes, I know that.

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:31.173
It was a bad mistake, but it's done.
Over. We have to move on.

01:05:31.242 --> 01:05:33.248
I don't know.

01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:36.417
What? What don't you know?

01:05:36.488 --> 01:05:39.042
<i>People make mistakes. Mea culpa.</i>

01:05:39.145 --> 01:05:44.000
But they don't want to trash their lives.
Guilty as charged.

01:05:44.105 --> 01:05:47.040
Sometimes you have to learn the hard way.

01:05:47.146 --> 01:05:50.690
You know, you're not the only one
that doesn't sleep at night.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.536
OK. Tell me you don't
make mistakes yourself.

01:05:55.465 --> 01:05:57.767
Maggie.

01:05:57.866 --> 01:05:59.937
Maggie, come on, please.

01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:05.955
If you have any feelings for me, please.

01:06:06.058 --> 01:06:08.840
Think about this for a while, huh?

01:06:10.058 --> 01:06:12.032
Hey, come on.

01:06:23.304 --> 01:06:25.280
Oh, Michael, no.

01:06:25.769 --> 01:06:28.452
What?

01:06:28.521 --> 01:06:32.678
You didn't give me this case
to help my career.

01:06:32.778 --> 01:06:35.626
You wanted to cover your ass.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:40.511
If this ever came up, who better to keep your
secret than someone you're sleeping with?

01:06:40.618 --> 01:06:42.528
You asked me for this case.

01:06:42.602 --> 01:06:45.600
You threw the bait down
and waited for me to snap it up.

01:06:45.705 --> 01:06:49.861
Maybe this isn't completely clear to you,
Maggie. If I go down, so do you.

01:06:49.928 --> 01:06:52.449
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- You're about to.

01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:56.319
You're gonna break rule no. 1,
which is don't fuck your friends.

01:06:56.426 --> 01:06:59.393
You turn on me,
every lie here is gonna turn on you.

01:06:59.498 --> 01:07:02.531
You'll be on the bricks
faster than you can dream of.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:06.659
When you try to tie into another firm,
you'll be lucky to get hired as a messenger.

01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:10.239
I guess that's a risk I have to take.

01:07:12.457 --> 01:07:14.912
Look around you, Maggie.

01:07:15.018 --> 01:07:18.017
I'm all you've got, anywhere.

01:07:18.985 --> 01:07:23.044
Now, you do this, you are all alone.

01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:28.200
Frederick, the way I see things...

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:31.714
The way you see things
is what's gotten us in this position.

01:07:31.818 --> 01:07:35.462
My father does want
all of the information on Pavel.

01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:39.010
We hand this over,
we lose Argo and the case.

01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:41.699
If we don't give full disclosure
and we get caught,

01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:44.933
we lose the confidence of all our other clients.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:51.461
You're jeopardizing the biggest corporate
play this firm has ever been involved with.

01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:53.537
We're down to the wire here.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.888
We cannot let this become
even more of a disaster.

01:07:57.963 --> 01:08:00.646
What do you want to do?

01:08:01.547 --> 01:08:05.636
How long did Pavel work for Argo?

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.454
32 years.

01:08:08.522 --> 01:08:14.338
You have to figure, an awful lot
of paper would build up over that time.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:19.044
Right.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:21.122
So we bury it.

01:08:22.027 --> 01:08:26.368
We send them everything. Every letter,
every phone message, every scrap of paper.

01:08:26.442 --> 01:08:30.501
Anything we can find,
we'll send them the Library of Congress.

01:08:30.571 --> 01:08:33.919
They just have to pull the files
from the year the research was done.

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:38.247
- Things get misfiled.
- You can't do that.

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:40.734
We can inventory the documents
any way we like.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:44.290
Come up with some arcane structure, bury it.

01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:48.584
Bottom line, it is within the letter of the law.

01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:52.163
- It'll work.
- It had better, Michael. It had better.

01:08:52.265 --> 01:08:54.372
Now, both of you, this matter is quarantined.

01:08:54.443 --> 01:08:57.639
No one outside this room is to hear about it.

01:08:59.243 --> 01:09:02.689
There is still the matter of Miss Ward.

01:09:02.761 --> 01:09:04.288
What does that mean?

01:09:04.363 --> 01:09:11.849
Well, it's obvious there are serious questions
regarding her loyalty to this case.

01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:20.037
I consider her an important and extremely
loyal member of this team, Michael.

01:09:20.139 --> 01:09:23.401
Are you going to have a problem with that?

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.604
No.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:26.982
Good.

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:39.872
Can I see that, please?

01:09:44.299 --> 01:09:47.048
There it is, page 23, third from the bottom.

01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:51.173
I transposed the numbers,
put it in project 2340.

01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:54.023
Plausible deniability.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:59.621
- Congratulations, they'll never find it.
- That is the idea.

01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:02.440
- Ah, the glamour of law!
- Justice by avalanche.

01:10:02.538 --> 01:10:04.808
Maggie, you're just defending your client.

01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:10.603
- What about the victims?
- They should have had a better lawyer.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.660
- This entire box is from 1963.
- This is ajoke.

01:10:14.731 --> 01:10:16.968
All of my labels are falling off.

01:10:17.068 --> 01:10:22.217
Let's just keep digging.
Maybe we'll find what we're looking for.

01:10:22.282 --> 01:10:26.210
Hey, what's going on?
We lose our lease?

01:10:26.282 --> 01:10:31.553
No, this is a Father's Day gift,
courtesy of Quinn Califan and Lunt.

01:10:34.347 --> 01:10:37.609
- What's so funny?
- Don't you get it?

01:10:37.707 --> 01:10:41.765
We ask for one man's files.
She sends us a paper blizzard.

01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:45.730
- She's hiding something.
- Yeah. Maybe.

01:10:45.803 --> 01:10:49.250
- I ever tell you you're a terrific lawyer?
- Yes.

01:10:49.322 --> 01:10:51.330
I lied.

01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:56.834
Find this guy Pavel. You know,
the bunny man? I wanna talk to him.

01:11:02.187 --> 01:11:06.922
The testing methodology was state of the art
at the time and that's what we went by.

01:11:07.019 --> 01:11:10.533
OK, George.
We're through for the day.

01:11:10.603 --> 01:11:13.254
You're still talking a little above the jury.

01:11:13.324 --> 01:11:15.395
Not that that would be difficult.

01:11:15.499 --> 01:11:17.474
Just keep it simple.

01:11:18.122 --> 01:11:21.799
- I wish I'd never seen that damn report.
- Makes two of us.

01:11:21.899 --> 01:11:25.282
- May I ask a question, please?
- Sure.

01:11:25.388 --> 01:11:29.414
Why didn't you just
change the blinker circuit?

01:11:33.739 --> 01:11:35.943
It's just a question.

01:11:42.826 --> 01:11:47.366
I told Flannery about the problem
a month or so before he died.

01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:50.054
- He called in his head bean counter.
- What's that?

01:11:50.124 --> 01:11:53.222
- Risk management expert, right?
- Yeah.

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:57.220
Flannery shows him the data and asks him
how much it would cost to retrofit...

01:11:57.291 --> 01:12:00.521
- You mean recall?
- Yeah, you got it.

01:12:00.619 --> 01:12:03.619
To retrofit 175,000 units.

01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:08.165
Multiply that times 300 bucks a car,
give or take.

01:12:08.268 --> 01:12:11.137
You're looking at around $50 million.

01:12:11.212 --> 01:12:15.139
So the risk guy,
he crunches the numbers some more.

01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:20.100
He figures you'd have a fireball collision
about every 3,000 cars.

01:12:20.172 --> 01:12:22.277
That's 158 explosions.

01:12:23.084 --> 01:12:25.572
Which is almost as many
plaintiffs as there are.

01:12:25.644 --> 01:12:28.262
These guys know their numbers.

01:12:34.093 --> 01:12:38.369
So you multiply that
times $200,000 per lawsuit.

01:12:38.443 --> 01:12:43.681
That's assuming everybody sues and wins.
30 million max.

01:12:43.788 --> 01:12:48.458
See? It's cheaper to deal with the lawsuits
than it is to fix the blinker.

01:12:48.524 --> 01:12:54.089
It's what the bean counters
call a simple actuarial analysis.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.075
Dad?

01:13:28.269 --> 01:13:32.162
- Dad!
- Miss Ward? What an honor.

01:13:32.268 --> 01:13:35.049
You've come to admire your handiwork, I see.

01:13:36.268 --> 01:13:39.497
- Is he here?
- He's gone.

01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:45.127
This wasn't my idea. I'm sorry.

01:13:46.028 --> 01:13:48.101
I'm glad to hear that.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.355
So.

01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:58.822
You guys got anything stronger
than herb tea to drink around here?

01:14:04.589 --> 01:14:07.239
That bad?

01:14:07.339 --> 01:14:10.756
I'm sorry.
Deborah usually does this kind of thing.

01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:14.604
- You mean she has anotherjob?
- Maggie! She's married.

01:14:15.628 --> 01:14:18.181
That never stopped him before, Nick.

01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:21.318
She's married to a woman named Cindy.

01:14:23.789 --> 01:14:24.771
Really?

01:14:24.845 --> 01:14:28.489
Really. He doesn't play around any more,
or maybe you hadn't noticed.

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:32.419
- Nope. Maybe I didn't care.
- Of course you care. The man owns you.

01:14:32.492 --> 01:14:37.446
Everything you are, everything you do
is based on driving him crazy.

01:14:37.549 --> 01:14:41.443
- Well, thank you, Dr Freud.
- Like it takes a genius to spot it?

01:14:41.548 --> 01:14:44.997
Jesus, Maggie!
If he stands up, you sit down.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.062
If he turns right, you turn left,
even if you don't want to.

01:14:49.134 --> 01:14:51.883
Your biggest aspiration
is to be his mirror image.

01:14:51.982 --> 01:14:57.764
Exactly the opposite of what he is,
and the problem is you don't know what he is.

01:14:57.869 --> 01:15:00.738
That makes being you impossible.

01:15:00.813 --> 01:15:03.683
You give him too much credit, Nick.

01:15:04.684 --> 01:15:06.692
I guess you always have.

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:15.943
And what the hell have you done?

01:15:19.054 --> 01:15:21.420
You're probably gonna beat him, Maggie.

01:15:21.486 --> 01:15:23.491
We both know that.

01:15:24.332 --> 01:15:29.547
You got the staff and the money
to grind us into the ground.

01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:36.103
But even if he loses,
he'll know he went down on the right side.

01:15:36.173 --> 01:15:39.043
You'll have your big success.

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:44.037
Your partnership. And what else?

01:15:49.933 --> 01:15:51.940
I got work to do.

01:16:09.102 --> 01:16:11.076
What?

01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:16.972
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:56.938
- Of course, he denied everything.
- There's not one single copy left?

01:16:57.005 --> 01:17:01.414
- No.
- Then, who's to say the notes ever existed?

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:06.499
Here! Good dog.

01:17:06.574 --> 01:17:08.614
Go catch the ball.

01:17:08.685 --> 01:17:10.758
It won't work, Mr Quinn.

01:17:10.861 --> 01:17:13.895
I can still testify.
I can tell them the notes existed.

01:17:13.966 --> 01:17:18.701
What then? Your testimony will be vitiated
by Michael who has an impeccable record

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.937
and loyal friends in the legal community.

01:17:21.005 --> 01:17:23.558
And you will have destroyed
a very promising career.

01:17:23.662 --> 01:17:25.931
I'd hate to see that happen.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.115
What about Pavel?

01:17:30.223 --> 01:17:33.965
My father will find him, call him up
as a witness and he'll blow the cover.

01:17:34.063 --> 01:17:36.647
I don't think so.
We have a way of neutralizing him.

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.724
- How?
- You.

01:17:43.342 --> 01:17:45.927
I watched your deposition of Mr Kellen.

01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:49.641
You discredited him while making it seem
like he was doing it to himself.

01:17:49.742 --> 01:17:51.652
That takes talent.

01:17:51.726 --> 01:17:57.062
The good doctor's a far more impeachable
witness. He shouldn't be a problem.

01:17:57.134 --> 01:18:02.055
At least, I hope it's you. The jury accepts this
kind of thing much better if a woman does it.

01:18:02.126 --> 01:18:07.973
But even if it's not, you can be certain the
good doctor will be dispatched by someone.

01:18:08.045 --> 01:18:10.053
It's going to happen.

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.868
This is really the way you want it?

01:18:13.933 --> 01:18:16.323
It's the way it is.

01:18:16.429 --> 01:18:21.165
Bottom line, Michael Grazier's put us
in an extraordinarily difficult position.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:24.296
When it's over, he's going to pay for it.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.920
But that needn't concern you.

01:18:27.022 --> 01:18:29.925
You're gonna be far too busy...

01:18:30.031 --> 01:18:33.607
as the youngest partner
in the history of this firm.

01:20:31.534 --> 01:20:33.542
- Margaret!
- Yeah?

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:39.722
- Margaret, are you here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:41.328 --> 01:20:44.362
Nick said you came by the office
the other night. Did you...

01:20:44.496 --> 01:20:47.016
- Yeah.
- I guess we just missed each other.

01:20:47.088 --> 01:20:49.094
How did you get in?

01:20:49.968 --> 01:20:52.454
I used your mother's key.

01:20:52.526 --> 01:20:55.144
I tried calling you
but your phone's been disconnected.

01:20:55.215 --> 01:20:57.387
Come in.

01:20:57.455 --> 01:21:01.415
I didn't want to use it but I...

01:21:01.487 --> 01:21:06.605
I got worried.
I thought something had happened to you.

01:21:06.703 --> 01:21:09.485
Your mom was mad at me
when she died and I...

01:21:10.095 --> 01:21:13.161
Don't worry. I'm not going out any windows.

01:21:14.894 --> 01:21:18.604
I just wanted to say that I was sorry
and I'm wrong. I was dead wrong.

01:21:18.703 --> 01:21:22.282
I got real defensive.

01:21:22.383 --> 01:21:27.718
I started... I was acting like a clown.
I was bullying people. You...

01:21:27.823 --> 01:21:29.895
Dad, you don't have to do this.

01:21:29.967 --> 01:21:32.968
Wait, I'm not finished yet. I...

01:21:36.176 --> 01:21:37.965
I guess I'm finished.

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:54.278
Would you sit down?

01:21:54.385 --> 01:21:56.358
Yeah.

01:22:01.104 --> 01:22:03.078
You can just toss that.

01:22:06.769 --> 01:22:10.281
Dad. I wish Mom were here.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:13.417
I wish I could call her and talk to her.

01:22:13.488 --> 01:22:15.560
And yet I know exactly what she'd tell me.

01:22:16.304 --> 01:22:19.653
And I was going to call you. I was.

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:23.306
I wanted to. But I didn't know how.

01:22:27.088 --> 01:22:31.823
I'm so used to being angry with you
that anything else just doesn't feel right.

01:22:31.887 --> 01:22:33.895
It felt kind of awkward.

01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:38.443
I'm sorry I spent my whole life
being angry with you.

01:22:38.544 --> 01:22:44.458
It's been a constructive anger.
I've gotten a lot done, somehow.

01:22:44.528 --> 01:22:48.456
You were also my scapegoat.
If anything went wrong, I blamed it on you.

01:22:48.528 --> 01:22:52.935
Anything. I could fail a test
and somehow it was your fault.

01:22:54.831 --> 01:23:00.200
Now I look at things as they are
and I realize I need a new approach.

01:23:03.664 --> 01:23:07.013
I don't have the slightest idea where to begin.

01:23:08.367 --> 01:23:10.374
I don't know.

01:23:11.728 --> 01:23:16.365
I get up and pray to God I can get through
the day without somebody catching on.

01:23:16.463 --> 01:23:20.458
In-between, it's just all smoke and mirrors.

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:26.093
I always thought I was doing the right thing
but maybe I was wrong. I don't know.

01:23:31.537 --> 01:23:36.522
I think that's the first time
I ever heard you say that.

01:23:36.624 --> 01:23:38.729
I guess I should work on that, shouldn't I?

01:23:54.768 --> 01:23:56.590
Come in.

01:23:59.152 --> 01:24:00.134
Hi.

01:24:09.457 --> 01:24:11.660
- These are for you.
- Fine.

01:24:13.234 --> 01:24:17.739
Nothing terribly important. Interrogatories,
depo summaries, witness lists.

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:20.264
Just leave it.

01:24:20.336 --> 01:24:22.726
Michael, you were right.

01:24:23.888 --> 01:24:26.855
I would make a lousy messenger.

01:24:30.993 --> 01:24:33.000
I'm listening.

01:24:33.105 --> 01:24:35.308
I saw my father last night.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:41.127
We talked about a lot of things.
Even got some of them straightened out.

01:24:41.233 --> 01:24:45.871
Afterwards I did some thinking
and I realized...

01:24:45.937 --> 01:24:51.054
I realized it had been a long time
since I'd done any thinking. It felt good.

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:55.374
Somebody once told me
an emotional lawyer is a bad lawyer.

01:24:55.472 --> 01:24:59.533
- I've been a pretty bad lawyer lately.
- No argument.

01:24:59.633 --> 01:25:04.488
I've come very close to blowing everything
around here for everyone, including myself.

01:25:05.009 --> 01:25:08.008
So, what do you say?

01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:11.152
You forgive me, I'll forgive you.

01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:15.783
Or I'll forgive you, you forgive me.
Please.

01:25:26.673 --> 01:25:29.062
Tell me what you know about Pavel.

01:25:31.249 --> 01:25:33.551
He doesn't have a chance.

01:25:36.145 --> 01:25:37.291
Right.

01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:45.773
Dr Pavel.

01:25:45.872 --> 01:25:50.095
Let's talk about the Meridian blinker circuit.

01:25:50.193 --> 01:25:55.529
In your capacity as research scientist at Argo,
did you have occasion to test it?

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:57.008
Yes, sir, I did.

01:25:57.105 --> 01:26:00.105
- Did you have any problems with it?
- Did we have problems?

01:26:00.177 --> 01:26:04.040
That circuit is garbage.
It blew up the gas tank.

01:26:04.146 --> 01:26:06.994
I said so in the report to Mr Getchell.

01:26:07.058 --> 01:26:09.611
It was his big invention.

01:26:09.713 --> 01:26:12.461
Big deal, Mr Getchell.

01:26:12.529 --> 01:26:16.010
So I gave him the report,
and after that, I don't know.

01:26:16.114 --> 01:26:20.369
You were certain, and still are, that this circuit
should not have gone into that car?

01:26:20.465 --> 01:26:22.921
Objection! Calls for conclusion.

01:26:23.026 --> 01:26:26.822
Your Honor, his job at Argo
was reaching conclusions just like this.

01:26:26.897 --> 01:26:28.785
Overruled.

01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:34.447
Should this circuit
have gone into the Meridian?

01:26:34.546 --> 01:26:37.895
Yes, if you want to kill people.

01:26:45.458 --> 01:26:48.807
- No further questions.
- Your witness, Miss Ward.

01:26:49.714 --> 01:26:54.352
Your Honor, does plaintiff's counsel
intend to introduce this alleged report?

01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:57.777
- Mr Ward?
- No.

01:26:58.578 --> 01:27:04.426
So the only evidence of its existence
is testimony, such as that of Dr Pavel?

01:27:06.099 --> 01:27:08.104
Yes, just testimony.

01:27:23.089 --> 01:27:29.801
Dr Pavel, in all of your years at Argo, you
must have worked on hundreds of projects.

01:27:29.907 --> 01:27:31.978
Oh, yes. Hundreds.

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:34.438
Could you tell me about
some of your favorites?

01:27:34.545 --> 01:27:39.499
Objection. Dr Pavel's former
research has no relevance here.

01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:41.392
Overruled.

01:27:41.746 --> 01:27:44.299
Please answer, Doctor.

01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.087
There were lots.

01:27:47.186 --> 01:27:50.056
The Atlas, that was a terrific car.

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:53.736
Motorcycle Python.

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:57.869
The Python.
Doctor, did it have circuit problems?

01:27:58.546 --> 01:28:03.214
No, but I worked on different motorcycles.
Maybe some of the others...

01:28:03.313 --> 01:28:07.886
Perhaps like the A100. Do you remember
a defective gasket on that one?

01:28:07.986 --> 01:28:09.961
A100?

01:28:11.186 --> 01:28:12.266
No.

01:28:12.338 --> 01:28:17.772
What about CA3200? According to
reports, an axle had to be replaced.

01:28:17.874 --> 01:28:21.388
Yes, yes. That was a wonderful motorcycle.

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:25.867
That was the first time we put that linkage
in a two-wheeled vehicle.

01:28:25.939 --> 01:28:28.753
The CA3200 was a pickup truck, Doctor.

01:28:28.818 --> 01:28:32.200
Objection. Your Honor,
she's testifying for the witness.

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:36.779
Sustained.

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:41.639
Doctor, what is 2762396?

01:28:41.746 --> 01:28:43.721
Objection! This is not a math test.

01:28:43.827 --> 01:28:45.932
It goes to the quality of his memory.

01:28:46.036 --> 01:28:50.225
Overruled. I think, without the report,
the doctor's memory is relevant.

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:52.941
I'm going to allow this line of questioning.

01:28:53.011 --> 01:28:56.937
I'm not so good with numbers any more.
Could you please repeat it?

01:28:57.009 --> 01:29:00.141
Absolutely. 2762396.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.323
- Isn't that your phone number, sir?
- Objection!

01:29:05.426 --> 01:29:08.329
- Overruled.
- How about 94536?

01:29:08.434 --> 01:29:12.809
- Objection.
- Overruled. Sit down, Mr Ward.

01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:21.067
Your zip code, sir. 123019?

01:29:24.435 --> 01:29:26.409
Isn't that your birthday, sir?

01:29:28.306 --> 01:29:31.406
- And 0243?
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:29:31.506 --> 01:29:34.093
- All right, Miss Ward.
- Isn't that the Meridian?

01:29:34.195 --> 01:29:35.471
Miss Ward!

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.449
- Your Honor...
- No further questions.

01:29:37.555 --> 01:29:40.108
I'd like that last remark
struck from the record.

01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:41.805
Strike the last answer.

01:29:41.907 --> 01:29:45.224
- Miss Ward, I don't want to warn you again.
- Beautiful.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.115
You may step down, Doctor.

01:29:49.298 --> 01:29:51.949
Not good with numbers any more.

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:54.026
That's not a crime, is it?

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:57.579
I still remember the most important things.

01:29:57.907 --> 01:30:00.329
Next witness, Mr Ward.

01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:08.466
Your Honor, plaintiff calls Michael Grazier.

01:30:08.531 --> 01:30:12.110
What?
Objection! This is unsupportable!

01:30:12.179 --> 01:30:14.450
Your Honor,
I need him on the witness stand.

01:30:14.548 --> 01:30:17.329
- It's outrageous!
- Hold on.

01:30:17.427 --> 01:30:20.810
I want you all in my chambers now.
Recess.

01:30:23.091 --> 01:30:25.709
I don't care.
I need him on the stand.

01:30:25.779 --> 01:30:28.015
Come on, Jed. You listen to me!

01:30:28.114 --> 01:30:32.338
Go and turn some other courtroom
into a circus with your half-ass stunts.

01:30:32.436 --> 01:30:35.470
Come on, Fred.
If it's a stunt, if I'm ajoke, let me prove it.

01:30:35.539 --> 01:30:37.809
The jury came out
on that one a long time ago.

01:30:37.907 --> 01:30:40.363
- Wait a minute...
- Hold it!

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:43.316
Just sit down. Look, people.

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:46.728
Listening to you spit on each other
is entertaining as hell.

01:30:46.835 --> 01:30:49.487
But I gotta move this thing along.

01:30:49.587 --> 01:30:52.903
- Jed, what the hell are you doing?
- I have to have him on the stand.

01:30:52.979 --> 01:30:56.427
It's critical to show Argo's state of mind
when they built that car.

01:30:56.499 --> 01:31:00.809
- He can't do this without prior notice.
- He can. It's within your discretion, Judge.

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:04.942
He's trying to save face in front of his
clients, so they think he has something.

01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:07.249
There's no offer of proof here.

01:31:07.348 --> 01:31:10.032
You're asking for a leap of faith here, Jed.

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.336
Can you give me one reason why I should?

01:31:12.436 --> 01:31:15.152
The worst thing that can happen
is that I am wrong.

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.554
If I am, you're gonna make it
very ugly for me.

01:31:17.618 --> 01:31:21.394
I would think the thought of that
would be irresistible to you.

01:31:21.459 --> 01:31:26.380
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help you God?

01:31:26.452 --> 01:31:29.551
- I do.
- Be seated and state your name.

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:36.528
Michael McKinley Grazier.

01:31:37.428 --> 01:31:41.550
Mr Grazier, I understand you are
in charge of legal affairs for Argo

01:31:41.618 --> 01:31:43.506
in the firm of Quinn Califan and Lunt.

01:31:43.572 --> 01:31:47.696
I'm the chief legal liaison
between Argo and my firm.

01:31:47.796 --> 01:31:54.538
If somebody asks for a safety report on Argo,
someone like me, for instance,

01:31:54.611 --> 01:31:58.540
you would get it and you would turn
it over to them. Right?

01:31:58.612 --> 01:32:00.303
Right.

01:32:00.372 --> 01:32:04.016
All of them. Every single one.

01:32:05.076 --> 01:32:09.232
Mr Ward, you have all
the safety research in existence.

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:15.795
You mean there might be a report
that is no longer in existence?

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:21.457
There might be eight-legged mice on Venus.
That's another question I can't answer.

01:32:21.556 --> 01:32:25.168
Very easy for you to make jokes.
You have both your arms and legs.

01:32:25.269 --> 01:32:29.808
- Objection! Argumentative.
- Sustained.

01:32:29.909 --> 01:32:35.723
Opposing counsel's not suggested anything
thatjustifies keeping Mr Grazier on the stand.

01:32:35.828 --> 01:32:39.177
- Isn't it time to move on?
- I'm leaning in that direction.

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:40.976
Please get to the point.

01:32:41.077 --> 01:32:45.386
Mr Grazier, do you know of
the existence, now or in the past,

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:48.908
of a report calling into question
the safety of the Meridian model?

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.297
I can't testify on some hypothetical report.

01:32:52.373 --> 01:32:55.721
It wasn't hypothetical to Dr Pavel.
He wrote it.

01:32:55.829 --> 01:32:59.626
- So he says.
- So he says under oath.

01:33:01.237 --> 01:33:04.270
Do you understand, sir,
that you are testifying under oath?

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:08.017
- Yes, I do.
- And that perjury is grounds for disbarment?

01:33:08.117 --> 01:33:11.248
Mr Ward, I find that objectionable.
I do know the law.

01:33:11.349 --> 01:33:16.685
So do I. You're using semantics when
all you have to do is answer a question.

01:33:16.788 --> 01:33:21.971
- Did you see that report? Yes or no?
- Objection! The question has been answered.

01:33:22.068 --> 01:33:25.069
- It's been asked and has not been answered.
- Overruled.

01:33:25.142 --> 01:33:27.344
Yes or no? I think you're being evasive!

01:33:27.413 --> 01:33:30.095
I'm not.
I'm answering the questions you're asking.

01:33:30.196 --> 01:33:34.736
The hell you are! You know that,
I know that, the jury knows that.

01:33:34.837 --> 01:33:37.586
- Mr Ward...
- Everybody in this courtroom knows it.

01:33:37.653 --> 01:33:41.930
- Mr Ward, sit down.
- That son of bitch is getting to the jury.

01:33:42.035 --> 01:33:47.055
<i>No. He's only bluffing.
He did the same thing in Wrangell v Kincaid.</i>

01:33:47.156 --> 01:33:49.710
- I can handle this.
- Then do it.

01:33:49.781 --> 01:33:51.952
Miss Ward?

01:33:54.836 --> 01:33:59.309
Mr Grazier, Mr Ward has been
thundering on for quite some time now.

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:04.650
It occurs to me that, with all his fire and
brimstone, he might have confused the issue.

01:34:04.757 --> 01:34:08.302
I'd like to ask you a simple question,
straight out.

01:34:08.372 --> 01:34:12.977
Have you any knowledge of a report
calling any version of the Meridian unsafe?

01:34:16.022 --> 01:34:18.443
No.

01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:24.620
Have you ever seen one,
read one or heard of one?

01:34:26.421 --> 01:34:28.657
No.

01:34:35.478 --> 01:34:37.452
No further questions.

01:34:39.061 --> 01:34:42.607
Members of the jury,
what you've seen here is a little unusual.

01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:49.265
Mr Grazier's presence on the stand should not
influence you to find for or against his client.

01:34:49.331 --> 01:34:50.281
You may step down.

01:34:53.749 --> 01:34:57.709
Your Honor,
plaintiff calls Anthony Patricola.

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:00.912
- Who the hell is Anthony Patricola?
- I've never heard of him.

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.795
His name was there.
You must have missed it.

01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:07.856
I'm sure I gave it to you,
along with a bunch of other papers.

01:35:07.957 --> 01:35:11.732
Looked like the goddamn
Library of Congress.

01:35:15.061 --> 01:35:18.737
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:35:18.836 --> 01:35:21.902
- I do.
- Be seated and state your name.

01:35:23.797 --> 01:35:26.350
Anthony Patricola.

01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:28.690
What do you do for a living, Mr Patricola?

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:34.453
I am the chief accountant in the risk
management division of Argo Motors.

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:37.648
Are you what is affectionately
called a "bean counter"?

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:40.052
Yes, sir.

01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:43.945
- Are you the head bean counter?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:44.021 --> 01:35:47.185
- So you see a lot of reports in yourjob?
- Yes.

01:35:47.253 --> 01:35:51.988
- You take these reports and make...
- Bitch.

01:35:52.053 --> 01:35:54.388
You gave him Patricola.

01:35:57.462 --> 01:36:00.975
I'm sorry, Michael.
I guess it's in the genes.

01:36:01.078 --> 01:36:03.533
...a defective part.

01:36:03.638 --> 01:36:06.900
You make a decision whether
to replace that part in a recall

01:36:06.998 --> 01:36:10.226
or suffer the consequences of a lawsuit,
whichever's cheaper.

01:36:10.293 --> 01:36:12.148
Is that correct?

01:36:12.214 --> 01:36:16.175
I don't make the decisions,
I just analyze the reports.

01:36:16.277 --> 01:36:18.766
Reports, yes.
Let's talk about them.

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:23.408
Do you recall one questioning the safety
of the 1985 Meridian model?

01:36:26.133 --> 01:36:27.694
Yes.

01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:34.707
- Your Honor...
- Mr Quinn?

01:36:34.774 --> 01:36:38.603
May we approach?
Defense requests a conference in chambers.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.978
- And, Your Honor...
- Yes?

01:36:41.077 --> 01:36:43.052
Lead counsel only.

01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:47.856
All right, Fred. What's on your mind?

01:36:47.958 --> 01:36:50.828
Your Honor, there's been
an appalling conspiracy.

01:36:50.902 --> 01:36:54.382
One that has compromised our case.
I demand a mistrial.

01:36:54.454 --> 01:36:57.618
- Unbelievable.
- Let's hear it.

01:36:57.718 --> 01:37:01.974
Miss Ward's turned over
privileged information to her father.

01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:07.306
And he's accepted it, in flagrant violation
of every principle of legal ethics I know.

01:37:07.381 --> 01:37:11.822
- Which one would that be, Fred?
- Enough, Jed. This isn't ajoke.

01:37:11.894 --> 01:37:17.164
The joke is you're being asked
to consider legal ethics argument

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:19.244
from the boss of Michael Grazier.

01:37:19.349 --> 01:37:24.434
Michael Grazier no longer works
for Quinn Califan. He's a closed issue.

01:37:24.501 --> 01:37:27.884
- Ballast off a sinking ship.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:31.983
- I'll have the state bar discipline you.
- Do it! Please, do it.

01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:34.737
Your daughter will be thrown
out of the profession.

01:37:34.838 --> 01:37:39.694
Miss Ward discovered that Michael Grazier
had destroyed Dr Pavel's report.

01:37:39.798 --> 01:37:44.785
I'm entitled to that evidence.
That proved my case.

01:37:44.854 --> 01:37:48.432
She couldn't give it to me so she told me
about a corroborating witness.

01:37:48.502 --> 01:37:51.535
That's not only ethical, legal,
but imperative.

01:37:51.638 --> 01:37:55.567
By the way, you so much as look
in my daughter's direction,

01:37:55.671 --> 01:37:58.986
they won't be able to identity you
with dental records.

01:38:01.558 --> 01:38:04.974
Fred, if what he says is true,

01:38:05.077 --> 01:38:11.242
your firm has violated
at least three sections of the state bar act.

01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:15.092
- Listen, in the best interests of your client...
- But, Your Honor...

01:38:15.191 --> 01:38:17.940
...and what remains of your reputation,

01:38:18.039 --> 01:38:23.341
I think you ought to end this thing
as quickly and as quietly as possible.

01:38:24.215 --> 01:38:26.220
OK.

01:38:29.238 --> 01:38:33.395
I'm going to have to
clear this with Argo but...

01:38:36.311 --> 01:38:38.700
what's it going to take?

01:38:38.774 --> 01:38:42.516
Your Honor, I was looking
forward to trying this.

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:46.925
- 30 million.
- I think I've got a good chance of winning.

01:38:47.799 --> 01:38:53.102
Come on, Jed. Some of your clients
weren't even hurt that bad.

01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:03.089
50 million dollars.

01:39:07.702 --> 01:39:10.256
Dammit, Jed! What's it going to take?

01:39:10.359 --> 01:39:12.334
Bottom line, Fred?

01:39:17.016 --> 01:39:19.219
You can't count that high.

01:39:24.342 --> 01:39:27.059
- Alexander Pavel.
- Here's to Mr Minh's fishing fleet.

01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:29.775
Here's to 100 million dollars.

01:39:29.879 --> 01:39:33.262
PT Barnum. Father of us all.

01:39:33.335 --> 01:39:35.342
Cheers!

01:39:42.903 --> 01:39:44.911
- Jed.
- Maggie.

01:39:48.853 --> 01:39:51.309
- Hi.
- So how'd it go?

01:39:51.382 --> 01:39:54.099
- It worked.
- Good. Good, good.

01:39:54.199 --> 01:39:57.069
- Hi, darling.
- Thank you, Maggie.

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:01.807
Counselor.
I can still call you that, right?

01:40:02.295 --> 01:40:03.702
Yeah.

01:40:06.230 --> 01:40:08.500
You did good, Maggie.

01:40:12.343 --> 01:40:16.336
- What?
- It's just you two, together.

01:40:18.904 --> 01:40:24.206
I was beginning to think parenthood wasn't
such a good idea, but you give me hope.

01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:33.487
Dad,

01:40:35.512 --> 01:40:36.624
thank you.

01:40:36.695 --> 01:40:40.624
- Hey, you did it.
- No. Thank you.

01:40:47.318 --> 01:40:50.101
You know, I never told you but...

01:40:51.544 --> 01:40:56.465
when your mom told me that she was
pregnant and we were having you,

01:40:56.536 --> 01:40:58.902
I went out and got roaringly drunk.

01:40:58.999 --> 01:41:02.512
I prayed fervently
there had been a mistake at the lab.

01:41:06.392 --> 01:41:09.970
Even in those days, you didn't listen to me.

01:41:11.639 --> 01:41:17.969
Then you were in my arms and I looked
down at those little crossed eyes,

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:22.676
and I knew you were gonna break my heart.

01:41:25.464 --> 01:41:27.471
And you did.

01:41:30.201 --> 01:41:34.455
But you gave me back your mom
in your hands and your face...

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.134
- Dad...
- Yeah?

01:41:38.072 --> 01:41:39.795
I love you too.

01:41:46.712 --> 01:41:48.687
I promised Mom once...

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.975
that we would dance.

01:41:53.305 --> 01:41:59.749
