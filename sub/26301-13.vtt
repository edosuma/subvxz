WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:05.229
Look who's clearing the
table without being asked.

00:05.230 --> 00:07.760
Just trying to keep my mind
off my break-up with Gina.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.439
Wow. Depressed Oliver

00:10.440 --> 00:12.469
has just edged out
8-year-old NyQuiled Oliver

00:12.470 --> 00:13.980
as my new favorite Oliver.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.920
I know breakups are tough, but
you shouldn't stay home all day.

00:18.940 --> 00:20.240
You should go out and have some fun.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.579
You know what we're gonna do?

00:21.580 --> 00:24.340
We're gonna push your
curfew back an extra hour.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.500
- I could use an extra hour, too.
- No.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.319
Why does Oliver get an
extra hour and I don't?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.189
Oliver's trustworthy, and you're not.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.628
- What does that mean?
- Oliver good, Taylor bad.

00:32.630 --> 00:34.320
I don't know how to make it more clear.

00:34.390 --> 00:36.359
- Hey!
- Honey, we love you,

00:36.360 --> 00:38.500
but you have other qualities
that make you special.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.299
You've seen "The Sixth
Sense" three times,

00:40.300 --> 00:41.940
and you're always
surprised by the ending.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.069
You know why Mom and
Dad trust you so much?

00:47.070 --> 00:48.639
Because you're always studying.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.839
You're just a goodie-goodie good grades.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.979
"Oh, my gosh, I got an
A-minus, wah, Cooper!"

00:54.980 --> 00:58.349
Okay, first off, I wouldn't call
Cooper until I was done crying.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.189
And I'm not a goodie-goodie.
I can be dangerous.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.700
Hey, Taylor. Want to
play ponies with me?

01:03.860 --> 01:06.759
- Can't. Busy.
- Taylor's blowing me off!

01:06.760 --> 01:07.989
Taylor, play with your sister.

01:07.990 --> 01:10.459
All she wants to do is run
the boring Kentucky Derby

01:10.460 --> 01:11.980
with her plastic ponies.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.229
Off the turn, it's Duffy McSprinkles

01:14.230 --> 01:15.839
with Twinkle Toes right behind.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.239
It's a two-horse race.
Duffy, then Twinkle.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.909
Now, it's Twinkle, then Duffy!

01:19.910 --> 01:21.920
Twinkle Toes has this all
locked up, but wait!

01:21.930 --> 01:23.320
Sergeant Hooves has come out of nowhere

01:23.340 --> 01:24.979
and is speeding toward the finish line!

01:24.980 --> 01:26.649
It's gonna be a photo finish!

01:26.650 --> 01:29.919
And! It's Sergeant Hooves by a nose!

01:29.920 --> 01:34.249
A 20-to-1 underdog has just
won the Kentucky Derby!

01:34.250 --> 01:35.789
How is that boring?

01:37.790 --> 01:40.059
Hey, I'm thinking about
buying some new sheets

01:40.060 --> 01:41.529
with a three-digit thread count.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.820
Which ones do you like better?

01:43.560 --> 01:46.069
I don't think we have the money
to buy anything new right now.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.580
We don't, but I do.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.499
I got a performance bonus at work.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.269
I'm a little confused.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.739
The money you make is your money,

01:52.740 --> 01:54.809
but the money I make is our money.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.640
You're not confused,
Greg. You nailed it.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.749
The deal was you work
while I run the house.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.249
Because those two jobs are equal,

02:00.250 --> 02:02.160
any money you make is our money.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.779
Following you so far,

02:03.780 --> 02:06.189
but I feel you're about
to make a weird turn.

02:06.190 --> 02:09.919
But now, I run the house and
have a job on top of that.

02:09.919 --> 02:13.159
That is extra work, so any
money that I make is my money.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.059
Makes sense? Sure does.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.299
Yes, but while you're working,

02:16.300 --> 02:17.699
I'm the one who picks up the slack.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.269
I make dinners, drive
the kids to school,

02:19.270 --> 02:21.720
put Anna-Kat to bed,
and I still have a job.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.539
Seems to me like we're still equal,

02:24.540 --> 02:25.769
and if that's true,

02:25.770 --> 02:27.739
any money you make should
also be our money.

02:27.740 --> 02:28.820
Time out.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.039
Greg, this is something
important in our marriage.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.849
Before we make any decisions,

02:32.850 --> 02:35.349
there needs to be a longer,
in-depth conversation.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.049
I agree, so I...

02:37.050 --> 02:38.120
Oh, no, not with you.

02:38.140 --> 02:39.840
I need to go talk to
my friends about this.

02:41.050 --> 02:44.060
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

02:48.260 --> 02:50.759
So the bonus is my money.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.069
Uhhhhhh...

02:52.070 --> 02:54.069
This is the part where you say I'm right

02:54.070 --> 02:55.569
and maybe compliment my hair.

02:55.570 --> 02:56.739
Yeah, I'm sorry, Katie,

02:56.740 --> 02:58.739
but having separate
finances is a bad idea.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.609
Can you at least do the hair part?

03:00.610 --> 03:02.779
I wanted my money to be my money, too,

03:02.780 --> 03:04.439
but it helped drive a
wedge into my marriage.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.849
And now my ex-wife gets all of
her money and half of mine.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.719
I could've had a beach house.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.119
The trick to having a beach house

03:11.120 --> 03:12.919
is not letting anyone know you have one

03:12.920 --> 03:15.519
so that no one asks you to stay there.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.789
Doris, do you have a beach house?

03:17.790 --> 03:22.199
No, I don't have a beach house.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.089
Point is, Katie, whatever
money you and Greg make

03:24.090 --> 03:25.099
should be shared.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.499
I guess I could pay off some bills.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.199
No! Bills are boring.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.900
Spend it on something
fun, like a ski house.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.239
I don't have a ski house.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.079
- Oh. She got a ski house.
- Shut up.

03:40.310 --> 03:42.149
Here are your pizzas.

03:42.150 --> 03:43.319
Enjoy.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.779
Oh, uh, when we arrived,

03:44.780 --> 03:47.419
I gave the busboy a wedge of
parmesan I imported from Rome

03:47.420 --> 03:49.320
to keep refrigerated. Could
you get that for me?

03:49.460 --> 03:50.859
I could go get it,

03:50.860 --> 03:53.259
but then I will put it
someplace you don't want it.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.229
Oh, my.

03:55.230 --> 03:56.639
Hey, Cooper.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.850
- Hey, Oliver.
- Brie, Victoria.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.369
Cómo estás, ladies?

04:00.370 --> 04:02.399
Muy bien, ¿y tú?

04:02.400 --> 04:03.540
Say what now?

04:03.670 --> 04:05.470
You guys going to the
party at The Hill later?

04:06.540 --> 04:07.769
Wasn't planning on it.

04:07.770 --> 04:09.509
That's a shame because we're going,

04:09.510 --> 04:11.160
and we were hoping we'd see you there.

04:11.310 --> 04:13.280
Well, in that case, we're there.

04:13.810 --> 04:15.279
Awesome. See you tonight.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.620
iHasta luego!

04:18.149 --> 04:20.120
What in the hell is she saying?

04:20.620 --> 04:22.189
Hey, good for you, Oliver.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.859
- Way to get back out there.
- Thanks.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.889
It's been a while since
my break-up with Gina,

04:25.890 --> 04:28.159
and I think it's time for
me to man up and move on.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.600
You're absolutely right.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.569
Girls are like butlers.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.869
You may think you can't
live without Chester,

04:33.870 --> 04:36.900
but then Chester II comes
along and he's just as good.

04:37.470 --> 04:39.880
Your pep talks are never relatable.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.579
Phyllis, Phyllis,
Phyllis, please wake up.

04:45.580 --> 04:46.809
Don't be dead like the others.

04:46.810 --> 04:48.300
Please wake up.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.049
Ugh, I'm alright. I'm alright, Obediah.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.249
Come on. Let's go.

04:53.390 --> 04:56.800
What is on your phone anyway
that is better than ponies?

04:56.860 --> 04:58.429
I'm playing this game called Third Day.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.059
You run around with
strangers on the Internet,

05:00.060 --> 05:01.599
trying to stab goblins in the face.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.219
Can I play, too?

05:05.330 --> 05:07.069
I guess you can collect
weapons and potions for me.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.740
I'll download it for you.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.539
See?

05:10.540 --> 05:13.439
This way you can ignore me and
play with me at the same time.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.779
- Huh?
- It's working already!

05:17.580 --> 05:19.120
Well, hey, sweetie.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.209
How was your breakfast?

05:20.210 --> 05:21.349
Terrible.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.900
Doris and Angela agreed with you.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.289
Wow!

05:25.290 --> 05:27.289
I honestly thought this
day would never come!

05:27.290 --> 05:29.659
The bonus is definitely our money,

05:29.660 --> 05:32.759
but since it's ours, I thought
we could discuss how to use it.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.629
Okay.

05:34.630 --> 05:35.759
What do you want to do?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.499
- Put it in an emergency fund?
- No!

05:37.500 --> 05:39.099
Let's splurge! Blow it on ourselves!

05:39.100 --> 05:40.299
Live life for a change!

05:40.300 --> 05:41.869
- Go crazy!
- Yes!

05:41.870 --> 05:43.660
We can fix all the dents on the minivan.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.019
Maybe do something about that stain

05:45.020 --> 05:46.109
on the seat that never dries.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.339
We're not spending the money

05:47.340 --> 05:49.139
- on anything practical.
- Okay...

05:49.140 --> 05:51.909
We could go to that overpriced
Westport Hotel and Spa.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.960
That's an amazing idea.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.019
We're not spending money
to sleep in a hotel

05:57.020 --> 05:58.389
in the town we live in! That's insane!

05:58.390 --> 06:00.320
- You just suggested it!
- I thought you'd say no,

06:00.350 --> 06:02.200
and I'd be the cool and
impulsive one for once.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.800
No, Greg, it's perfect.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.539
Fine, but can you go
hard against this plan

06:05.540 --> 06:06.890
just so I can be the cool one again?

06:07.290 --> 06:10.529
Greg, we need to be responsible
and save our money and stuff.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.770
Sorry, Katie.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.499
But tonight, we're
splurging on ourselves

06:13.500 --> 06:15.120
and that's final!

06:15.140 --> 06:17.299
- We could put a little in a...
- If you say "Roth IRA,"

06:17.300 --> 06:18.909
I'm going to do a murder-suicide,

06:18.910 --> 06:21.430
but lose my courage on the suicide part.

06:24.310 --> 06:25.909
Okay. Thanks.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.479
Alright, we're booked for one
night in the Governor's Suite.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.309
The room has free high-speed Wi-Fi.

06:30.310 --> 06:33.279
I'm gonna download so many
books onto my Kindle.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.740
Why are you packing an empty bag?

06:34.780 --> 06:36.620
For the loot. I'm taking shampoo,

06:36.640 --> 06:39.159
toilet paper, a towel, maybe
a pair of wine glasses.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.959
We should bring packing peanuts.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.040
Taylor, stop!

06:42.050 --> 06:43.960
Anna-Kat, calm down!

06:44.900 --> 06:47.340
Rock, paper, scissors for
who has to deal with this.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.639
Ah-ha! You have to parent!

06:52.640 --> 06:54.869
Why do I always throw
back-to-back scissors?

06:54.870 --> 06:56.539
I have no sister!

06:56.540 --> 06:58.379
Someone want to tell me
why you two are fighting?

06:58.380 --> 07:01.779
Taylor left me to be eaten alive
by monsters in a dirty swamp.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.780
Inside a game. On my phone.

07:03.830 --> 07:05.429
I was surrounded by goblins,

07:05.430 --> 07:07.769
and instead of helping, she ran.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.239
And after I was killed,

07:09.240 --> 07:13.039
she came back and stole all my
weapons and healing potions.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.610
Dad, tell her this isn't a big deal.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.340
Anna-Kat, it's a very big deal,

07:16.360 --> 07:17.609
and you have every reason to be mad.

07:17.610 --> 07:18.909
- Ha!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.080
Why?!

07:20.130 --> 07:22.129
Sisters should take care of each other.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.669
Your siblings are the longest
relationship you'll ever have,

07:24.670 --> 07:26.939
and you need to have their backs always.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.939
Whether it's in a video
game or real life.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.839
You got that?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.639
Mom! Dad's trying to force
a teachable moment again!

07:33.640 --> 07:35.219
Don't bother your mother. She's packing.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.339
We're leaving you in charge

07:36.340 --> 07:37.699
because we're spending
the night at a hotel.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.319
- Ooh.
- No, there will be no...

07:39.320 --> 07:41.160
Well, there might be. It's
none of your concern.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.149
You can't leave me with her!

07:43.150 --> 07:45.589
She'd sell me for a
Forever 21 gift card.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.329
No, because Taylor's gonna
take this opportunity

07:48.330 --> 07:50.380
to prove she is an amazing big sister.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.099
Just to be safe. Oliver!

07:52.100 --> 07:54.080
Yeah, what's going on?

07:54.670 --> 07:56.169
We're leaving for the night.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.099
Taylor's in charge, but
you're in charge of Taylor.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.240
- Why?!
- Because he's safe and sensible.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.609
Hmm. Win for me.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.039
I'll take "screw-up" over
"safe and sensible" any day.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.339
Hey, I'm not sensible.

08:05.340 --> 08:06.739
Last week, I went out for barbecue,

08:06.740 --> 08:08.109
didn't even bring a stain stick.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.249
Don't fight it, Oliver.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.879
You come from a long line of Otto men

08:10.880 --> 08:12.079
who lived boring lives,

08:12.080 --> 08:13.649
but they died in their
sleep in their 90s.

08:13.650 --> 08:14.819
Isn't that great?

08:14.820 --> 08:16.990
Ha! Your life is gonna suck.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.520
Alright. It's time.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.679
Tell the chauffeur to pick us up

08:27.680 --> 08:29.020
and take us to the party on The Hill.

08:29.060 --> 08:32.399
Damn! Bentley's sick. He can't drive us.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.940
Why is life so hard?

08:35.000 --> 08:41.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:42.080 --> 08:43.620
Or we could drive ourselves.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.080
What are you talking about?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.360
We can take my dad's car.

08:46.370 --> 08:47.440
Are you insane?

08:47.450 --> 08:49.269
Everyone thinks I'm a goodie-goodie,

08:49.270 --> 08:50.439
but I'm not.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.839
I'm the type of dude who's not afraid

08:51.840 --> 08:53.740
to take a dip in the pool
straight after a meal.

08:54.510 --> 08:55.839
I ain't waiting that hour.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.339
What if Mom and Dad catch us?

08:57.340 --> 08:58.849
No, they're spending the night at the...

08:58.850 --> 09:00.380
wait, did you just
call them Mom and Dad?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.019
Okay, so maybe they won't catch us,

09:02.020 --> 09:03.619
but we're 15.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.680
We don't know how to drive.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.449
My mom drives while drinking coffee

09:06.450 --> 09:08.319
and yelling at us for being
ungrateful monsters.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.919
I think I can manage.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.259
- This isn't you.
- No, this is the new me.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.620
Listen, if we want to be
successful businessmen

09:14.640 --> 09:16.899
when we grow up, we're gonna
have to take some risks.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.499
Every CEO of every Fortune 500 company

09:19.500 --> 09:21.569
took their dad's car out
when they were teenagers.

09:21.570 --> 09:23.900
- Is that true?
- Don't look it up, but yeah.

09:30.210 --> 09:34.120
This room is amazing, Greg!

09:34.140 --> 09:35.749
Wow!

09:36.820 --> 09:39.389
The floor's not sticky!

09:39.390 --> 09:42.360
And look, the TV remote
is not on a leash,

09:42.370 --> 09:44.080
bolted to the table.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.729
This is the first hotel
room we've been in

09:45.730 --> 09:47.789
where I haven't gotten the sense
that something bad went down.

09:47.790 --> 09:50.580
Greg! A bowl of real lemons

09:50.600 --> 09:52.599
out of season.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.039
- Come on, Greg.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.939
Now who's "safe and sensible"?

10:03.940 --> 10:05.349
Dude, this is weird.

10:05.350 --> 10:07.009
Why aren't you in the front with me?

10:07.010 --> 10:08.449
Because I've never sat in the front,

10:08.450 --> 10:10.019
and I'm never gonna sit in the front.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.419
The Hill, chop chop.

10:18.130 --> 10:20.259
Oh, man.

10:20.260 --> 10:21.799
This feels good.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.999
So good.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.969
I'm in Heaven.

10:24.970 --> 10:26.699
Greg, what are you doing?

10:26.700 --> 10:28.320
Are you holding your breath?

10:28.340 --> 10:29.500
Sorry.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.720
My body is not accustomed to relaxation.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.969
You need to let yourself go.

10:33.970 --> 10:35.909
You deserve to enjoy yourself.

10:35.910 --> 10:39.480
Okay. I'll try.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.240
Oh, yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

10:44.790 --> 10:47.820
Just getting regular,
legitimate massages in here!

10:58.540 --> 11:00.869
We made it.

11:00.870 --> 11:03.199
Well done, man. You were
a natural out there.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.869
I mean, you're scared of making lefts,

11:04.870 --> 11:06.830
but three right turns gets
you there all the same.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.060
Ooh, there's Brie and Victoria
totally checking us out.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.309
- I got a cooler!
- What'd you bring, guys?

11:13.310 --> 11:17.600
Hey, let's not be too eager.
Just give them a "sup" nod.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.860
How's my hair?

11:22.900 --> 11:24.119
Fresh.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.140
- New conditioner?
- You know it.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.060
Hey, ladies.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.000
Did you guys drive here yourselves?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.149
Oh, yeah.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.519
You have a license?

11:33.520 --> 11:34.780
No, ma'am.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.749
I'm not afraid of getting
into a little trouble.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.359
And apparently you're not afraid
of leaving the car in neutral.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.330
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.689
Come back!

11:56.960 --> 11:58.939
Who needs an emergency fund?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.399
Mom and Dad are gonna kill us.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.799
They're not your mom and dad,
and they're not gonna kill you.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.869
They're gonna kill me.

12:09.870 --> 12:11.369
Oh, yeah.

12:11.370 --> 12:13.260
- Should we go mingle?
- No!

12:13.280 --> 12:15.539
You took your parents'
car without permission,

12:15.540 --> 12:17.049
and then crashed it?

12:17.050 --> 12:18.779
My sister did that,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.260
and then she got sent away.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.819
This is so bad. This is so bad.

12:22.820 --> 12:25.389
There's got to be a way to fix this.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.059
Wait a minute. You.

12:27.060 --> 12:28.480
You can fix this.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.939
- How?
- With that credit card

12:29.940 --> 12:31.559
your parents bought that
private island with.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.729
Oh, yeah!

12:32.730 --> 12:34.559
To be fair, we bought
that island with points,

12:34.560 --> 12:35.629
but you're right.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.199
Let's throw money at this problemo.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.869
I'll just buy an identical
car and swap it out

12:38.870 --> 12:40.439
before your parents get
home in the morning.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.409
If we set the radio stations to NPR

12:42.410 --> 12:44.110
and throw some compression
socks in the glove box,

12:44.120 --> 12:45.380
that might actually work.

12:47.980 --> 12:51.060
Mmm, hotel macadamia nuts.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.120
I did it. Gonna need a
whole new bucket list.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.749
$12?!

12:56.750 --> 12:58.489
Greg, what did we say?

12:58.490 --> 13:00.319
No more incredulously shouting

13:00.320 --> 13:01.659
the price of things from the minibar.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.659
If you want something, just have it.

13:03.660 --> 13:04.859
Screw it.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.299
What's that thing that
Taylor always says?

13:06.300 --> 13:08.429
- "Yol-Toe"?
- Uh-huh.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.120
It's definitely Yol-Toe.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.800
Yol-Toe!

13:12.970 --> 13:14.939
Greg, what is on your neck?

13:14.940 --> 13:16.100
What?

13:19.740 --> 13:21.609
Oh, no. It's hives.

13:21.610 --> 13:23.549
It's a reaction to the macadamia nuts.

13:23.550 --> 13:25.540
This is what happens when
you spend recklessly.

13:26.350 --> 13:28.219
Oh, I'm so itchy.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.689
We have to go home and get my
prescription antihistamine.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.089
Greg, you're fine.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.619
It's not like your throat is closing up.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.359
Oh, my God! That can happen?!

13:35.360 --> 13:37.389
How do I keep it open? I
have to keep using my voice.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.229
Ahh, ahh! Ahh!

13:40.360 --> 13:42.880
Ahh!

13:43.000 --> 13:44.299
Mom and Dad called.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.239
Dad had an allergy attack,
so they're coming home.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.839
It's time to go to bed.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.609
Mom tells me a story first.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.469
Um, okay.

13:51.470 --> 13:54.479
Ed Norton and Brad Pitt start
a fight club for some reason,

13:54.480 --> 13:55.879
and, in the end, they're the same dude.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.140
Good night.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.049
You know why I got so mad at you

13:59.050 --> 14:01.449
when you betrayed me in that video game?

14:01.450 --> 14:04.040
Because you spent years watching
"Real Housewives" with Mom

14:04.060 --> 14:05.189
and have been programmed to believe

14:05.190 --> 14:07.619
that's how a woman reacts to
the smallest of problems?

14:07.620 --> 14:08.700
No.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.880
Because Dad's right about you.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.680
You don't have anyone's
back but your own.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.580
You really think that about me?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.100
Ugh, that must be Mom and Dad.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.280
Oh, my God!

14:28.040 --> 14:30.149
What happened to Dad's car?

14:30.150 --> 14:31.940
And why is Oliver driving?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.320
What did you guys do?!

14:33.780 --> 14:35.889
I took Dad's car out, and I crashed it.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.220
What?! This isn't you!

14:38.290 --> 14:40.159
I know I screwed up, but don't worry.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.459
Cooper's gonna buy a new car and
have it here in the morning

14:42.460 --> 14:43.859
before Mom and Dad get back.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.320
Dad had an allergy attack.

14:45.330 --> 14:47.229
Mom and Dad are on their
way home right now!

14:47.230 --> 14:48.729
What? No.

14:48.730 --> 14:50.129
Oh, my God. I'm so busted.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.340
Not necessarily. I have an idea.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.399
Is everyone's passport current?

15:01.210 --> 15:02.780
What the hell?

15:09.020 --> 15:10.570
It's the bumper and the trunk.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.860
- This is gonna cost a fortune to fix.
- Ugh.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.189
I don't know whether my
throat is closing up

15:14.190 --> 15:16.029
because I'm having an allergy attack

15:16.030 --> 15:17.480
or because I'm having a panic attack

15:17.500 --> 15:19.039
over how much money we spent on

15:19.040 --> 15:20.699
M&Ms in a glass jar.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.599
Oh, you guys are home.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.480
Hey, Dad. How are... Oh, my God.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.120
What happened to the car?

15:27.020 --> 15:29.539
That branch must have fallen
when that big wind kicked up.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.860
Makes perfect sense to me.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.169
I knew this was gonna happen.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.840
I should've had that tree
trimmed a while ago.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.920
You're just lucky no one got hurt, Dad.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.540
Now that this mystery is all wrapped up,

15:38.620 --> 15:40.940
let's go inside. I'll put on some cocoa.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.160
But the thing is...

15:43.520 --> 15:47.100
how did a pine branch
fall from a maple tree?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.600
- Grafting?
- Yup.

15:49.730 --> 15:53.099
You guys have two seconds
to tell us the truth.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.429
- One...
- Well...

15:54.430 --> 15:55.629
- Two...
- Okay.

15:55.630 --> 15:57.120
I was the one who took out the car.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.839
- That's a big surprise!
- You crashed the car,

16:00.840 --> 16:02.469
and then you tried to get your
brother to cover for you.

16:02.470 --> 16:03.780
That's a new low, Taylor.

16:05.010 --> 16:07.409
What were you thinking?

16:07.410 --> 16:08.959
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.979
I'm gonna deal with you in the morning.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.979
I have to go inside and draw
your dad a Cream of Wheat bath.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.149
Why not an oatmeal bath?

16:15.150 --> 16:17.519
I'm not wasting the good
hot cereal on you, bro!

16:17.520 --> 16:18.919
Everyone, in the house!

16:18.920 --> 16:21.219
I don't know how this is gonna end up,

16:21.220 --> 16:22.519
but I wanted to say...

16:22.520 --> 16:24.059
I've had a great life with you.

16:24.060 --> 16:27.740
You're not dying, you're
just a little bumpy.

16:29.060 --> 16:32.050
I'm sorry I made us spend
all the bonus money.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.219
We should have put it
in an emergency fund

16:34.220 --> 16:36.609
like you said, so we
could pay for the car.

16:36.610 --> 16:37.739
I don't agree.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.069
- You don't?
- No.

16:39.070 --> 16:41.109
If this near-death experience
has taught me anything,

16:41.110 --> 16:43.349
it's that, while you have
to plan for the future,

16:43.350 --> 16:44.940
you also have to live for today.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.100
Yol-Toe, right?

16:47.120 --> 16:50.849
Yeah. "Yol-Toe."

16:50.850 --> 16:52.080
I had a great time tonight,

16:52.120 --> 16:54.860
up until the anaphylactic
reaction and the wrecked car.

16:54.990 --> 16:56.259
Me too.

16:56.260 --> 17:01.140
Plus I think that we
got our money's worth.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.598
Why'd you take a furry pillow?

17:04.599 --> 17:06.039
- New dog bed.
- Oh.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.500
Why'd you do that for me?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.539
We're supposed to have
each other's backs.

17:10.540 --> 17:11.638
Since when?

17:11.640 --> 17:13.039
Usually we just point and laugh

17:13.040 --> 17:14.339
at the person who gets in trouble.

17:14.339 --> 17:15.640
Since now.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.839
Like it or not, the longest
relationship we're gonna have

17:17.859 --> 17:19.148
is with each other.

17:19.150 --> 17:21.079
I honestly don't know what to say.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.148
If there's anything I can
do for you, just ask.

17:23.150 --> 17:25.749
Switch rooms with me. Your
closet is bigger than mine.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.459
No.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.159
But don't let that ruin the moment.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.980
This was good stuff.

17:33.630 --> 17:35.460
Taylor, front and center.

17:37.330 --> 17:38.440
Your mother and I slept on it,

17:38.470 --> 17:40.099
and as punishment for wrecking my car,

17:40.100 --> 17:42.039
you're gonna get a job to pay
us back for the repairs.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.300
When am I supposed to work?!

17:43.320 --> 17:45.509
I have rehearsal for the new
school musical like every night.

17:45.510 --> 17:47.740
Well, you're going to have
to quit the musical, then.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.479
We gave you an opportunity
to be responsible,

17:50.480 --> 17:51.649
- and you blew it.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.779
Every weekend, you're here in your room.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.300
But...

17:55.360 --> 17:56.580
Okay.

17:56.660 --> 17:57.700
It was me.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.800
I was the one who crashed the car.

18:01.820 --> 18:02.879
What?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.100
And me!

18:04.120 --> 18:05.540
Don't hate me, Mom and Dad.

18:06.030 --> 18:07.899
Taylor was just covering for me.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.600
Is that true?

18:09.700 --> 18:10.969
You did that for him?

18:10.970 --> 18:14.469
Yeah, of course. He's my brother.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.400
I'm proud of you.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.879
Are you crazy?! What were you thinking?!

18:21.880 --> 18:23.209
You're not even allowed to drive!

18:23.210 --> 18:25.879
Cooper and I snuck out to
meet some girls at a party.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.779
We forgot to put the car in park,

18:27.780 --> 18:29.460
it rolled down a hill,

18:29.500 --> 18:31.020
and it crashed into a tree.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.420
I don't even know what to say.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.689
- That's never happened before.
- I'm sorry.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.059
It's just you guys always call
me the sensible kid and...

18:38.060 --> 18:39.630
So you're mad because
we think highly of you?

18:39.740 --> 18:41.729
I wanted to do something reckless,

18:41.730 --> 18:44.129
and it turned out a little
more reckless than I wanted.

18:44.130 --> 18:45.969
He was actually a very safe driver.

18:45.970 --> 18:48.869
Ten and two the whole
way. Wasn't too chatty.

18:48.870 --> 18:51.339
Would've been nice if there was
a chilled evian in the back.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.609
Let's go from the top. You
and Cooper sneak out...

18:53.610 --> 18:56.099
Grounded for a month!

18:56.100 --> 18:57.280
... drive my car...

18:57.300 --> 18:59.760
- No phones for six months!
- ... without a license...

18:59.780 --> 19:03.160
Most kids take their driver's
test at 16. Not you.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.419
You're gonna be the
weird spandex bike guy

19:05.420 --> 19:06.589
until you're 21.

19:06.590 --> 19:07.689
And I'm buying you the shorts.

19:07.690 --> 19:09.840
And you're wearing the shorts!

19:10.060 --> 19:13.199
I think the biggest issue here
is the damage to the car,

19:13.200 --> 19:15.599
- and for that, I'd like to pay...
- No.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.629
To pay us back for the
repairs, you're getting a job.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.439
A minimum-wage job.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.780
I want you to pay us back nice and slow.

19:24.110 --> 19:26.860
We also lied to your face.
No punishment for that?

19:27.510 --> 19:29.109
What are you doing, man?

19:31.810 --> 19:33.900
And that's the last of my bonus.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.919
Hey, new guy. Treat these people well.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.380
Give 'em a salad on the house.

19:39.390 --> 19:41.989
A side salad. Small. To split.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.559
Thank you, waiter.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.829
Would you like croutons on that?

19:44.830 --> 19:46.999
W-W-Who gave you the authority

19:47.000 --> 19:48.380
to toss in croutons?

19:50.500 --> 19:51.520
Busboy.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.939
Why are you working here again?

19:54.940 --> 19:55.949
It's my punishment.

19:55.950 --> 19:57.509
But we're not your parents.

19:57.510 --> 19:59.120
Guys.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.929
Anna-Kat, there's an orc on your six.

20:04.930 --> 20:08.420
I'm more worried about that
creepy sorcerer following us.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.580
Oh, God. You're right.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.999
He's just standing there watching us.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.399
Who is that?

20:13.400 --> 20:16.909
'Tis I. Gregor Otto, the
Elvish necromancer.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.139
Have you been following
us inside the game?

20:19.140 --> 20:21.160
Just wanted to make sure you
two were working together.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.629
I'll go in with my melee weapon

20:22.630 --> 20:24.700
- while you cast "Enduring Pain."
- On it.

20:26.330 --> 20:29.350
I've never been more proud
to be disemboweled.
