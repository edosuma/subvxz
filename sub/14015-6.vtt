NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.903 --> 00:06.723
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.773 --> 00:08.653
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.709 --> 00:11.489
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.315
These are their stories.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.404
He's no Dr. Dre.
You're such a jerk.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.534
You like this stuff,
you're both jerks.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.699
She likes Michael.
No. She likes Sly.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.899
You mean Rocky?
No, I mean like,

00:27.961 --> 00:30.531
"Boom laka-laka-laka,
boom laka-laka-laka."

00:30.597 --> 00:32.907
What's that?
What's that?

00:33.233 --> 00:34.683
You're such a kid.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.805
Sit tight. When you get home,
you ask your dad all about it.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.512
STEFAN: Leave the radio.
Oh, all right, all right.

Patrick's the best.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.669
What about Shaquille?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.667
He makes too many commercials.

(RIC LAUGHING)

01:06.833 --> 01:09.183
Ric, who's that?

01:10.571 --> 01:11.881
(sun FIRES)

02:20.707 --> 02:23.447
First time in 12 years
I fire my gun.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.960
Hey, if you hadn't, we'd
be outlining you in chalk.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.583
Lennie, they couldn't
have been more than 16.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.860
No ID, no gun.
The other one had it.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.734
You shot the one
without the gun?

02:35.789 --> 02:39.129
They tried to rob me.
Look, it happened fast.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.042
LOGAN: I don't know.
What?

02:42.763 --> 02:46.733
The dead kid. The entrance
wound was in his back.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.480
Hey, no problem.
We got two eyewitnesses.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.880
You guys saw
the other kid, right?

02:57.210 --> 03:00.190
Yeah.
Did you see his gun?

03:11.725 --> 03:14.465
Ask me again,
I'll give you the same answer.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.598
JACK: You know it's part
of the drill, Lieutenant.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.065
(SIGHING)

03:20.634 --> 03:24.214
He pointed a gun at me.
A Raven .25.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.614
The one who ran away?

03:25.672 --> 03:29.122
No, the dead one. Then the
gun spontaneously combusted.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.152
Attitude will get you
indicted, Lieutenant.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.451
Three hours of this crap and
no sleep, what do you expect?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.288
Don't you think it might be
more advantageous

03:36.349 --> 03:38.449
to look for the kid
with the gun?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.125
I should have gone
to law school.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.497
Maybe I could come up
with a plan like that.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.366
JACK: Captain Burnett's men are canvassing
the neighborhood with the sketch.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.570
If there's anything else
you remember?

03:48.628 --> 03:51.668
Has the body been identified?
JACK: They're working on it.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.398
We should check Missing Persons,
his parents may miss him.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.808
Damn.
Why didn't I think of that?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.711
Now I see
why she made lieutenant.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.047
I could do without the
attitude, too, Captain.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.420
Yeah, I got an attitude.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.720
It usually shows up when a cop
shoots an unarmed kid in the back.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.793
We've had enough. My client's due
for her psychiatric evaluation.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.130
Part of the drill, too.
Right, Captain?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.443
BURNETT: She shot an unarmed
kid in the back, Lennie.

04:22.662 --> 04:26.112
Until I learn different,
she's like any other suspect.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.866
BRISCOE: Except she's been
wearing a badge for 12 years.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.180
That's what I want to know about.
Oh, what?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.809
How, just the other day
over coffee, she said,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.445
"There's too many punks
on the street,

04:36.510 --> 04:38.320
I think I'll pop a couple
in front of my kids"?

04:38.378 --> 04:39.518
Get off it.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.187
You've been on the job, what,
25 years, right?

04:43.250 --> 04:45.460
How many kids
you shoot in the back?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.333
I'm just saying maybe she
got a little nervous.

04:49.389 --> 04:52.799
I don't know,
lost control, panicked.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.269
She's a good cop.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.714
Look, Lennie,
we both know what's what here.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.208
They get out of the academy,
street's too dangerous,

05:00.267 --> 05:01.767
so they're assigned a desk job.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.245
All that free time
between dog bites,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.444
they get to study
for the sergeant's exam.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.754
She put in three years
undercover narcotics.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.293
She's a good cop, all right?

05:13.713 --> 05:15.623
She said the kid had a piece.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.082
I buy it.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.628
I'm sure your lieutenant's
a nice lady, Logan,

05:22.255 --> 05:25.235
but that doesn't mean
she should be running a squad.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.002
Well, what is it
that bothers you, Burnett?

05:28.261 --> 05:32.001
That she's wearing a skirt
or that she's black?

05:32.566 --> 05:36.276
For your information, I got
A-plus in politically correct.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.507
I love Afro-Americans.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.476
I love Gyno-Americans.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.815
But if one of them happens to
shoot a kid for no reason,

05:45.078 --> 05:47.058
that cop's gonna get nailed.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.320
I can't help you.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.234
Don't be a hero, Logan.
You know procedure.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.565
You and everybody else
in your precinct

05:59.159 --> 06:01.369
better keep their butts
out of this.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.811
I know we gotta do this,

06:06.867 --> 06:09.007
but I'm okay
with what happened. Really.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.139
A dead boy?
You must feel some remorse.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.235
Please,
that's not what I meant.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.178
I'm just saying I did what I had
to do under the circumstances.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.918
Nobody doubts that.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.090
Well, nobody in this room,
anyway.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.746
They'll find the boy, they'll find the gun.
This'll all go away.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.730
Not all of it.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.498
What? I'm gonna have nightmares? I'm
gonna wake up with cold sweats?

06:33.193 --> 06:35.833
Tell me something
I don't know, Doctor.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.166
Anita.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.544
It doesn't worry me
if you're feeling guilt.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.140
It worries me
if you go into denial.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.175
You know what I worry about?

06:47.574 --> 06:51.024
I worry about what could have
happened if I didn't have a gun.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.861
I worry about
the kind of world we live in

06:53.914 --> 06:56.924
when kids would kill
for a couple of dollars.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.094
Here we go.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.702
Last six months, three ATM
jobs, same neighborhood.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.329
Hey, you wanna get us
a reprimand from downtown?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.135
That's not our business, Mike.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.506
This has nothing to do
with Van Buren.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.165
These kids were white.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.974
Oh, yeah, right.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.236
And while
we're looking into it,

07:17.304 --> 07:18.584
we just happen
to run across the kid

07:18.638 --> 07:20.638
who waved the gun at Van Buren.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.651
Well, then that would be
a coincidence.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.520
(PHONE RINGING)

07:26.913 --> 07:30.523
Logan. Yeah, all right.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.230
You got an address?

07:32.819 --> 07:33.849
Shoot.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.193
Uh-huh.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.065
Good. Thanks.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.708
The dead kid's description matched
a 14-year-old named James Gordon.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.804
His mom ID'd him this morning.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.167
Mike, I got a pension coming.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.279
So does Van Buren.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.789
MARJORIE: I already talked
to you people.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.694
Can't you leave us in peace?

07:59.846 --> 08:03.226
There were other robberies, Mrs. Gordon.
We're just doing our job.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.753
Like I told those other cops,
my son was not a criminal.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.156
That woman just shot him dead
because he was big and black.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.174
I'm sorry, but your son
was at the scene of a crime.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.426
My son could barely
dress himself.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.565
He was mentally retarded, okay?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.478
Now please, go.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.301
Did you ever see this boy
with your son, Mrs. Gordon?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.851
I didn't this morning
and I still don't.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.213
He wasn't a friend of James'?
No.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.691
Who's Guinevere?

08:39.452 --> 08:41.062
She was James' friend.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.260
Did James paint that?

08:44.824 --> 08:47.904
He can't write a sentence,
but he can draw real nice.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.908
Mrs. Gordon, about Guinevere?

08:56.603 --> 08:59.413
She was just some white girl
he was sweet on at school.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.822
She's retarded, too.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.749
James made this for me.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.921
He did? It's pretty.

09:08.114 --> 09:11.434
Gwen, I got a picture
of one of James' friends.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.664
I was just hoping maybe
you could tell me who he is.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.220
Think hard, sweetie.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.286
I don't know him.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.699
Honey, could you look at him
a little closer?

09:21.761 --> 09:23.901
Maybe tell me
if you've seen him around?

09:23.963 --> 09:25.503
It's okay. Go ahead.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.377
BRISCOE:
You sure you don't remember?

09:29.436 --> 09:32.276
James isn't coming back
to school.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.377
I'm sorry.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.952
Yeah. Well, if she remembers
anything... Sure.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.391
Come on, sweetie.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.876
Goodbye.
Bye.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.958
When I was 14, my mom knew
everybody I hung with.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.161
How many friends packing metal
did you invite over for brunch?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.434
Look, all I'm saying is, if I
had a kid that was retarded,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.503
I'd be all over her like a rug.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.333
No, what you're saying is maybe
Van Buren made this face up?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.540
If some people step in it
bad enough,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.742
they'll say anything
to get rid of the stink.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.414
She's not stupid, Lennie.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.853
Having brains doesn't
keep you from panicking.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.408
What is this?
Do you think she's lying?

10:11.845 --> 10:15.215
It happened fast, right?
So maybe she's exaggerating.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.488
Her boys saw the other kid.
But they didn't see a gun.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.125
Hey, this isn't
a popularity contest, Mike.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.227
All I'm saying is there's a lot of
sides to look at in this thing.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.460
And one side says
if there wasn't any gun,

10:26.526 --> 10:30.026
it would really make Van Buren's
day if we didn't find the kid.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.009
VAN BUREN:
Burnett's trying to bury me.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.905
He's a pimp.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.314
He wants to make deputy
inspector on your back.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.314
(SIREN WAILING)

10:43.376 --> 10:44.576
(SIGHING)

10:44.644 --> 10:47.494
No one can find that kid
you saw run away.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.794
I saw him, Mike.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.716
You know, from now on, you better
knock three times on my office door.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.359
You don't, I may get antsy,
blow you away.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.095
Nobody's saying that. Nobody's
giving me any medals, either.

11:02.162 --> 11:06.372
Look, you gotta know, no kid, no
gun, it's not gonna be an easy ride.

11:06.432 --> 11:10.142
I'm the one who had a gun shoved in my face.
I'm the victim here.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.213
And still everybody wants me to
say I did something wrong. Uh-uh.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.453
I'm sorry.
I didn't do anything wrong.

11:19.512 --> 11:24.332
I tell you what. 14-year-old kid
with a size 18 collar. He ate well.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.434
Well, an ATM a day
buys you a lot of ice cream.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.600
See these blood stains here?
That's a type AB negative.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.157
Oh, good.
I got dibs on his liver.

11:33.226 --> 11:37.826
Not if you want to live past tomorrow.
Your dead kid was a type Jo. Positive,

11:38.565 --> 11:41.665
as evidenced by the blood
adjacent to the entrance wound.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.544
You're telling me there's two
types of blood on the shirt?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.744
Yeah.
Son of a gun had a busy day.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.181
I don't know. It doesn't
really prove anything.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.253
I mean, could be Mom didn't
wash his shirt for a week.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.619
Or it could be confirmation
of Van Buren's story.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.086
Think about it for a minute.
VENDOR: Here you are.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.962
Put some stuff on there,
will you?

12:01.020 --> 12:05.030
Van Buren shoots the other kid in the
arm or leg, someplace not fatal.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.202
It's a through-and-through
and it kills James Gordon.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.971
VENDOR: Here's your change.
The old magic bullet theory?

12:11.030 --> 12:13.140
Hey, it worked
for the Warren Commission.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.039
If I'm right and this kid got
hit, maybe he went to an ER.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.142
And if we're lucky,

12:17.203 --> 12:18.843
somebody followed procedure
and reported it.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.005
Yeah.

12:21.474 --> 12:25.724
Hospitals reported 12 gunshot wounds
between 5:00 p.m. and midnight.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.018
BRISCOE: Any of them who don't
have their driver's license yet?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.721
There's one
who's still in diapers.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.762
How about teenagers
in the West 90s?

12:31.818 --> 12:35.358
Two. There's a Dorothy Jones
and a Craig Singleton.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.455
Said he was shot
in a drive-by.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.033
Left the emergency room
at Our Lady

12:39.092 --> 12:41.472
before our guys got there
to take his statement.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.437
Five-to-two
he's got a sheet.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.270
Save your money, Logan.

12:47.233 --> 12:50.153
Craig Singleton AKA Hammerhead.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.713
Priors for assault, armed
robbery, disorderly conduct.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.714
He's a gangbanger with the
Blue Deuces in Harlem.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.476
It gets better. Keep reading.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.724
Deceased, March 6, 1993.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.261
Our boy used an alias.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.946
Somebody he knew and respected.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.228
Thanks, Ana.
If anybody asks...

13:07.553 --> 13:08.963
Briscoe who?

13:09.255 --> 13:12.355
Blue Deuces. One of your
more popular social clubs.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.495
You know a member named
Craig Singleton?

13:14.560 --> 13:15.800
You mean Hammerhead.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.102
I busted him maybe six times.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.914
Favorite song, Cop Killer.
Favorite color, green.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.037
Favorite pastime, beating
65-year-old widows with a bat

13:24.103 --> 13:25.553
to get their welfare checks.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.445
But one of the grannies fought back?
Somebody did.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.388
Found him in a vacant lot,
12 bullets in the back.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.153
No suspects, no arrests.

13:32.512 --> 13:36.022
He must still have a fan club
because somebody copped his ID.

13:36.282 --> 13:39.132
Wouldn't surprise me, the kid is
a regular hero among the masses.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.955
Where do these masses hang out?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.590
Try the block,
125th and Broadway.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.104
Easy.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.004
Ten years from now,
one of those kids will sign

13:50.063 --> 13:52.133
a $60 million deal
with the NBA.

13:52.198 --> 13:56.078
Hey, in 10 years, half those
kids will be dead or in the can.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.875
Hey, didn't you hear?
We got a new crime bill.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.917
Then make that five.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.082
Hey, Lennie.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.484
Look at that,
that kid's been to a doctor.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.186
He didn't get that
on a fast break.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.703
Why couldn't he
have been shot in the leg?

14:31.938 --> 14:35.008
Hey, come here. Where you going?
Hey, man!

14:35.108 --> 14:36.418
Hey, I ain't done nothing, man!

14:36.476 --> 14:38.286
You get that arm playing
cowboys and Indians?

14:38.344 --> 14:39.694
No, I took a bullet.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.376
"Took a bullet."

14:44.984 --> 14:46.904
You can't keep me here, man.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.703
Look, my son
said he didn't do anything.

14:49.822 --> 14:53.072
And I'm sure he won't do it again, right?
Real funny.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.496
Eddie Murphy
better watch his ass.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.171
Now why do you wanna go and use language
like that in front of your mom?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.342
MRS. ROWLAND: I heard
it all before, mister.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.781
Hey, speaking of funny, Zack,
wanna know who cracks me up?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.606
Zack Rowland, 14.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.911
BURNETT:
The judge, that's who.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.613
The one who's gonna send you
away for armed robbery.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.424
I hope someone
read him his rights.

15:10.877 --> 15:14.477
Signed the waiver in triplicate
in front of his mom.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.417
You can do me a real favor,
Zack.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.332
You can send me a postcard
from Attica, okay?

15:19.886 --> 15:23.956
I was always curious about what it's
like playing choo-choo with a real man.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.333
You see, to me personally,
it's no big deal.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.627
But all those guys up there in the
joint, they can't all be wrong.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.673
You know what I mean?

15:35.802 --> 15:38.012
You can't prove nothing, man.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.211
That's right.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.950
I can't prove a damn thing.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.893
But there's a Lieutenant Van Buren who's
got your dimples stuck right here.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.288
I never heard of him.
It's a she.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.334
And that hole in your arm,

15:53.686 --> 15:56.166
she was instrumental
in putting it there.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.369
She picks you
out of a lineup, Zack,

16:00.059 --> 16:01.539
it's all over.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.926
Tell the man what you know,
boy.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.042
You got it all wrong, man.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.424
Me and James, we see this
lady at the cash machine.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.084
We figure maybe she could
spare a couple of bucks.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.783
And just to emphasize the
charitable nature of her donation,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.787
you stick a piece in her face.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.185
We ain't had no steel, man.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.058
All I know was the bitch
freaked, started shooting.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.500
I just tore ass.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.626
Yeah, right. Straight to
Little League practice.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.262
The kid's full of crap.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.667
Well, somebody is.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.228
MRS. ROWLAND:
My son didn't do anything.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.776
BURNETT: Maybe you're right.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.695
You had to be there
to see the humor.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.852
Don't you think we owe Van Buren
the benefit of the doubt?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.938
Discretion doesn't play a part.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.614
Cop shoots citizen, it goes
to the grand jury. Period.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.376
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
have to go tomorrow.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.815
The kid's gun will turn up.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.760
The longer we wait, the more it looks
like we're covering something up.

16:58.618 --> 17:02.398
A retarded, unarmed, black kid
gets killed by a cop?

17:02.455 --> 17:03.825
The fuse is lit.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.863
I don't want to wait around
for the explosion.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.262
Look, I've worked
on dozens of cases with her.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.869
She's a good cop.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.635
I can't see ruining her career
for a little good PR.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.510
We're doing what the law requires.
No more, no less.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.654
RIC: Dad had to work,

17:23.342 --> 17:27.521
so Mom said she would take me and my brother
to the city for a movie and dinner.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.647
Is that what happened?

17:32.652 --> 17:35.062
You have to answer
out loud, Ric.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.604
We never got to dinner.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.839
Could you tell us why?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.474
Mom said she needed
to get money from the bank.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.344
She told me and Stefan
to stay in the car.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.778
JACK: And what happened then?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.410
We were listening to the radio.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.680
We saw the two kids
come up to Mom.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.460
We were scared.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.525
Then we heard it.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.303
What was that, Ric?

18:17.763 --> 18:18.763
Ric?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.244
She didn't mean anything.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.482
Why do you want to
put her in jail?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.515
What did you hear, son?

18:30.810 --> 18:31.910
A gun.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.476
We saw the big kid fall,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.915
and the other one run away.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.729
Your mom shot the big kid?

18:43.489 --> 18:44.559
Yes.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.825
Could you see if either one of
the boys was carrying a gun?

18:53.432 --> 18:54.472
No.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.742
ZACK: Me and James, we was
just hanging, you know.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.249
JACK: And what time was that?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.022
I don't know, maybe 7:00.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.294
We went to see James' old lady,

19:08.681 --> 19:11.181
and on our way home
he says he wants a Coke,

19:11.250 --> 19:13.360
but neither one of us
got a coin.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.099
So what did you do?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.568
James has this thing, you know,

19:17.623 --> 19:19.663
'cause he kind of big and dumb,

19:19.892 --> 19:21.742
so people get scared of him.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.435
So he walks up to people
and they give him money.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.338
You're saying he panhandles.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
No.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.578
He asks and they give him.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.137
Like that night
at the cash machine.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.320
He asked that lady for a dollar or
something, he says to get back home.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.818
But she just turns around
and starts shooting at us.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.020
I don't even know
what's with her.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.462
Were you carrying a gun,
Mr. Rowland?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.116
No way.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.497
What about Mr. Gordon?
Him neither.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.830
All right. Thank you.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.569
VAN BUREN: I withdrew $300.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.165
I don't usually carry
that much cash,

19:58.931 --> 20:01.381
but I put the money in my purse

20:01.434 --> 20:03.914
and I saw their reflection
in the glass.

20:04.136 --> 20:08.376
One of them, the smaller one,
said, "I'll take it all, bitch."

20:09.375 --> 20:12.145
I reached in my purse
as if to get the money

20:12.211 --> 20:14.161
and grabbed my weapon instead.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.717
I turned to them,

20:16.382 --> 20:19.022
identified myself
as a police officer.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.662
The shorter one had a gun.

20:22.021 --> 20:25.161
He pointed it at me.
I fired my weapon.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.871
The bullet went through
the arm of one perpetrator

20:28.928 --> 20:31.768
and into the back of the other.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.538
That's all.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.739
You aimed at one of the boys
and you killed the other.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.242
Yes. That wasn't my intent.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.538
What was your intent?
To apprehend the perpetrator.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.181
And to save yourself?

20:45.144 --> 20:46.214
Yes.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.145
Were you thinking
about your kids in the car,

20:49.215 --> 20:51.715
what, 10 yards away
from the cash machine?

20:51.817 --> 20:53.157
Of course.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.962
You feared for your life,

20:56.021 --> 20:58.301
you feared for the life
of your kids,

20:59.291 --> 21:02.101
you were thinking about
apprehending Mr. Rowland.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.474
That's a lot to be thinking about
in maybe two or three seconds.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.371
I saw a gun, Mr. McCoy.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.243
How long have you been on
the force, Lieutenant?

21:09.301 --> 21:10.971
Going on 12 years.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.307
Would you say
over those 12 years

21:13.539 --> 21:16.709
that the majority of people
arrested for violent felonies

21:17.677 --> 21:19.317
were African-American?

21:24.450 --> 21:26.330
What are you implying?

21:26.585 --> 21:28.385
Please answer the question.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.129
I don't know.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.700
What about your personal
experience, Lieutenant?

21:34.860 --> 21:36.400
In your own precinct?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.301
The majority of the arrests

21:42.334 --> 21:44.514
were of non-Caucasians.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.285
Was that thought bouncing
around in your head, too,

21:48.340 --> 21:51.340
that night in front of
the cash machine? No.

21:51.844 --> 21:55.384
So if it was two white kids
that came up behind you,

21:56.482 --> 21:58.662
you wouldn't have
acted any differently?

21:58.717 --> 22:02.527
Mr. McCoy,
someone points a gun at me,

22:03.055 --> 22:07.495
the last thing I think about
is what color he is.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.514
Are you having fun in there?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.366
What do you mean?
Give me a break.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.505
You're going out of your way
to give her a hard time.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.141
There was no reason
to bring up race.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.406
Wrong. There was
a 14-year-old kid

22:22.475 --> 22:24.845
lying on the sidewalk
with a bullet in his back.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.510
Lieutenant Van Buren
put it there.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.419
She thought she was being attacked.
She thought.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.489
There's a chance that the
color of the kid's skin

22:31.550 --> 22:32.690
had something to do with that.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.131
So you don't think
she was justified?

22:35.187 --> 22:38.187
I think that's up to
the grand jury to determine.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.425
I took away any chance
that kid had.

22:43.262 --> 22:46.472
I know better than anybody
what's going on in the streets.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.512
They pulled a gun on you, Anita. You
did what any cop would have done.

22:49.568 --> 22:52.238
I busted my butt for 12 years.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.715
I'm a black woman lieutenant

22:55.941 --> 22:57.611
in the New York City
Police Department.

22:57.676 --> 23:01.416
Do you have any idea
what that means?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.080
I'm not any cop, Doctor.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.889
If I was, I'd still be
writing parking tickets.

23:06.152 --> 23:09.292
And now you're afraid of losing
all you've accomplished?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.292
No.

23:12.491 --> 23:16.231
I'm angry that everything
I've accomplished

23:16.295 --> 23:19.395
is being ignored
because of a mistake.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.043
Do you feel it was a mistake?

23:23.202 --> 23:26.452
The mistake is that a kid died.

23:30.809 --> 23:35.049
And the entire city
is trying to crucify me.

23:36.181 --> 23:37.661
That's the mistake.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.440
KIRK: There's really no point in waiting.
DONALD: She can call us at home.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.673
VAN BUREN: Staring at four walls?
No, thank you.

23:49.728 --> 23:53.108
Even if they return an indictment,
it's a long way from a conviction.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.695
She's right, Anita.
My God, that was quick.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.248
I guess they didn't
have much to discuss.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.938
They no-billed you,
Lieutenant.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.654
Congratulations.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.115
Mrs. Gordon,

24:10.049 --> 24:12.149
I'm sorry about what happened.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.670
JACK: You did what you had to
do, I did what I had to do.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.569
I'm not looking for a kiss
and make up, Counselor.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.131
But I would like to know
what you're going to do now.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.680
And you have some suggestions.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.875
If I'm telling the truth, that
means Zack Rowland's lying.

24:32.938 --> 24:34.978
The grand jury
failed to indict.

24:35.374 --> 24:38.984
That's not the same as establishing
that you were telling the truth.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.964
What's that supposed to mean?

24:41.580 --> 24:44.250
The grand jury no-billed you
because they need you.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.886
Like most citizens,
they're sick and tired

24:45.951 --> 24:47.161
of what's going on
in the streets.

24:47.219 --> 24:50.059
Are you saying they thought I
shot that kid intentionally

24:50.122 --> 24:51.162
and let me go anyway?

24:51.223 --> 24:53.263
I'm saying
that they don't care.

24:53.692 --> 24:57.232
They're just happy that he won't be
showing up at any of their ATMs.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.114
Look,

25:04.169 --> 25:07.079
as far as I'm concerned,
this case is over.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.947
As far as the Chief of Detectives
is concerned, this case is over.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.886
I'd say
you had a pretty good day.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.755

the grand jury transcript.

that we're public servants,

25:22.121 --> 25:24.121

25:24.189 --> 25:25.729
BRISCOE
He's just being realistic.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.361
He needs more than our say-so
to go into a courtroom.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.197
Maybe we can give it to him.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.172
Zack Rowland on the stand.

25:32.665 --> 25:37.305
"We went to see James' lady and on the
way home, he says he wants a Coke."

between the lines?

25:42.608 --> 25:43.988
The retarded girl.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.693
Gwen Sheffield.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.994
She says she never even
saw Zack Rowland.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.187
Looks like she's telling a
little white one, doesn't it?

25:54.119 --> 25:55.719
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

25:55.788 --> 25:58.558
I told you I don't know him.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.371
I know you did, honey,

26:00.426 --> 26:03.596
but maybe you didn't recognize
him from this picture.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.636
We really need your help.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.495
His name's Zack.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.114
BRISCOE: Zack Rowland.
I don't know him.

26:11.170 --> 26:15.120
He said that he and James
were at your house.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.454
LOGAN: He also says
you have a crush on him.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.823
I do not. I hate him.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.848
So you do know Zack?
I hate him.

26:26.051 --> 26:29.161
He said he would shoot me

26:29.321 --> 26:33.101
if I told about him and James.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.692
Why would he do that?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.240
He has a gun.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.878
It's my fault James is dead.

26:40.666 --> 26:45.636
My friend Debbie Green
has a bracelet I like.

26:46.338 --> 26:50.808
James said he would
get me one for my birthday.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.506
James said that to you?

26:53.379 --> 26:56.449
No, but that's why he's dead.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.219
It's not your fault.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.593
Honey, how do you know
Zack has a gun?

27:00.686 --> 27:02.596
He showed it to me.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.034
It's on his roof.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.271
It's on the roof?

27:08.594 --> 27:11.174
Shall we all go to the roof
and look for it?

27:12.798 --> 27:15.568
BRISCOE: Take your time, Gwen.
It was here.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.381
Do you remember
where he hid it?

27:17.436 --> 27:21.006
Me and James and Zack,
we were here.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.883
I was scared.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.652
Well, don't be.
We won't let anybody hurt you.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.191
Zack's bad.

27:27.579 --> 27:31.249
Now, just try to think back, Gwen.
When did you see the gun?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.016
After school.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.815
You were standing here?

27:36.455 --> 27:38.025
Where was Zack?

27:39.925 --> 27:42.055
I think you're getting warm,
Mike.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.195
There's something caught
in the pipe here.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.446
Smoking.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.523
Mr. McCoy, I know you've been
out of school a long time,

28:07.886 --> 28:10.366
but you do need an arm
for armed robbery.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.296
Read the complaint.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.671
Your client is charged with
using a Raven model A-25,

28:15.727 --> 28:17.897
which is presently
in the evidence room.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.313
Hell, that ain't mine.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.114
Gwen Sheffield says it is.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.906
Yeah, and Bonnie never
testified against Clyde.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.713
The dead boy's girlfriend
gives you a gun,

28:26.772 --> 28:29.692
and you expect a jury to believe
that it belongs to my client?

28:29.741 --> 28:33.921
I guarantee she's got a lot more credibility
than this fine upstanding citizen.

28:33.979 --> 28:37.429
Oh, yeah, and who's not gonna
believe the pretty white girl?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.531
Your client is a felon,
Mr. Osborn.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.030
The fact that he's black
is not relevant.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.569
Maybe to you.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.301
It is relevant to a whole lot
of people I know in this city.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.571
That sounds like a threat.
You bet.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.927
I scream, "Burn, baby, burn,"

28:54.032 --> 28:57.102
and something somewhere
goes up in smoke.

28:58.337 --> 29:02.307
But, because by nature
I am a nonviolent man,

29:02.574 --> 29:05.184
I'm willing to make you
this one-time offer.

29:05.611 --> 29:06.991
We can talk deal,

29:07.479 --> 29:09.429
but nothing
that includes jail time.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.191
Then you'll be talking to yourself.
Fine.

29:14.052 --> 29:15.432
Let's go, Zack.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.643
We put Gwen on the stand
to prove it's Zack's gun,

29:23.695 --> 29:25.935
Osborn will cross her
about the bracelet.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.938
It adds to Zack's credibility.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.797
Maybe we don't have to
put her on the stand.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.454
They traced the gun
to Jeffrey Crockett.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.606
He owns a candy store
on 96th St.

29:39.144 --> 29:42.254
Don't ask me. That gun was
stolen six months ago.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.764
You're obliged to report it,
Mr. Crockett.

29:44.816 --> 29:47.556
Hey, come on. I'm just trying
to run a little business here.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.719
Yeah. And I'm just trying
to put this kid in jail.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.668
Why don't you just make
this easier for both of us?

29:53.258 --> 29:55.258
He used to work for me
part-time.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.474
He was a screw-up,
so I fired him.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.309
He took a going-away present.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.940
Let me guess,
his name was Zack Rowland.

30:04.436 --> 30:09.106
Close. Tony Rowland.
His buddies called him G-Dog.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.689
You want to mess
with these animals? Have fun.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.926

his way around a courtroom pretty good.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.226
Five arrests.

30:22.721 --> 30:25.361

left on your parole.

of your parole being revoked.

Says the man,

30:39.137 --> 30:40.667
says gun possession.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.293
Maybe you need
a new prescription.

Your former employer says you took
it without asking his permission.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.553
And guess what?

30:52.617 --> 30:56.057
That very same weapon was used
to hold up a police lieutenant.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.109
but I ain't used it.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.910
Who did?
I sold it.

31:14.439 --> 31:15.579
Half a yard.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.250
You'd take 50 bucks
from your little brother?

enough to pull it out on cops.

that he sold a gun to Zack.

Van Buren ID's it as the gun
that Zack pointed at her.

would be more appropriate.

No good.

The Gordon boy died

32:01.586 --> 32:04.256
while Zack Rowland was committing
one of the proscribed felonies.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.933
That makes it felony murder.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.491
Felony murder doesn't apply
to accomplices.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.073
James Gordon was retarded.

If his mental age was such that
he couldn't form the intent

32:12.364 --> 32:13.434
to commit a crime,

32:13.498 --> 32:16.568
he couldn't have been an
accomplice as a matter of law.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.005
Adam,

32:18.236 --> 32:21.976
I think we ought to re-arraign
young Mr. Rowland for murder.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.980
Before we get charged
with abusing our discretion,

32:25.310 --> 32:27.420
see how incompetent
this kid was.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.717
James Gordon was classified
as severely retarded.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.853
Could you quantify that?

32:33.985 --> 32:35.485
His IQ was right around 40.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.664
He was functional, but
required a lot of supervision.

32:38.723 --> 32:42.173
What does an IQ of 40 translate
to in intellectual age?

32:42.227 --> 32:45.207
It doesn't. We don't make
those kinds of assessments.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.977
Most of the training I did
with James was remedial.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.983
Basically, kindergarten level.

32:50.268 --> 32:53.718
But you put a paintbrush
in his hand, he was special.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.622
Could he read and write?
Barely.

32:55.674 --> 32:56.914
I had to stay
after school with him

32:56.975 --> 32:59.075
to help him learn to spell
his girlfriend's name.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.324

Guinevere.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.978
It took him two weeks.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.861

thought it was some kind of game.

Well, Your Honor, I'm not even
sure I understand the charges.

You see, the boys in blue have
got a little egg on their faces,

33:41.653 --> 33:44.133

black boy they can find.

see Gwen Sheffield's statement.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.922
Gwen said James needed money
to buy her a bracelet.

It's potentially exculpatory. Under
Brady we're obliged to turn it over.

If it were exculpatory.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.362
Wait a minute.

34:55.427 --> 34:59.427
Osborn could argue it proves James
Gordon had intent to commit robbery.

And he'd be wrong.
First year law school, Claire.

X murders Y to get his wallet.

35:05.170 --> 35:09.590
X's intent is to kill, his
motive is to get the bucks.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.505
The former is an element of the crime.
The latter is not.

35:12.577 --> 35:15.787
A jury might think James' reason for
being at the scene is relevant.

35:15.847 --> 35:16.847
And they'd be wrong, too.

35:16.915 --> 35:20.115
Maybe James Gordon had a reason
to be on that street corner.

35:20.185 --> 35:23.355
The bottom line is that fact
has absolutely nothing to do

to form the intent to commit a crime.

too, Jack,

35:40.572 --> 35:43.112
but we're walking
a very fine line here.

35:43.175 --> 35:46.155
The law says I don't have to
give it to them, Claire.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.158
And besides, I don't want to.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.788
I saw the gun and then I identified
myself as a police officer.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.460
This was previously marked
as People's three.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.837
Is this the gun you saw
in the defendant's hand?

36:04.896 --> 36:07.036
It's the same make
and model, yes.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.508
But People's three

36:14.573 --> 36:17.713
was not the same gun that
killed James Gordon, was it?

36:17.776 --> 36:18.776
No.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.984
Please, could you tell us what
kind of gun actually killed him?

36:22.047 --> 36:25.117
It was a .38 caliber
Smith and Wesson.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.664
And who owns it?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.286
I do.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.602
And who fired it?
I did.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.598
So, in your mind,

36:36.394 --> 36:40.144
James Gordon must have appeared
competent enough to commit a crime.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.538
Objection. Competence.
Sustained.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.177
No more questions.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.914
OLIVET: I never
examined him personally,

36:49.040 --> 36:51.150
but I reviewed
his complete medical history

36:51.209 --> 36:52.979
and interviewed people
who knew him.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.424
And what were your findings?

36:54.479 --> 36:56.889
James Gordon had a form
of mental retardation

36:56.948 --> 36:58.478
known as microencephaly.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.930
The frontal lobes of his brain
never developed.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.866
And what is the significance
of that, Doctor?

37:03.922 --> 37:07.172
He lacked the ability to perform
higher order activities,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.665
such as logical reasoning
and planning.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.765
So, in your opinion,

37:11.863 --> 37:16.073
was he capable of forming
the requisite criminal intent

37:16.501 --> 37:20.041
to perform a criminal act
as defined by the penal law?

37:20.105 --> 37:21.205
No.

37:24.776 --> 37:28.616
Now, James Gordon attended school
every day, is that correct?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.627
In a special program, yes.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.093
Yes. That's right.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.002
Now his school

37:37.122 --> 37:39.432
was on 103rd St.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.895
He lived with his mother
on 138th.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.203
Do you know
how he got to his class?

37:47.632 --> 37:49.842
His mother said
that he rode the bus.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.811
Oh, yes, the Broadway line,
I believe it was.

37:54.139 --> 37:57.449
Now, do you know if he traveled alone?
Yes, he did.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.053
So every morning,

38:00.845 --> 38:03.585
he was capable
of making exact change.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.632
He knew where to get on the
bus and where to get off,

38:06.685 --> 38:10.055
and he repeated the same process
in reverse at the end of the day.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.231
Only the frontal lobes
were underdeveloped.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.290
This never affected his memory.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.409
He was fully able
to perform rote activities.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.842
Like pulling a stickup job?
Objection.

38:19.898 --> 38:20.998
Sustained.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.114
Thank you very much.
You've been helpful.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.751
Olivet was convincing.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.084
Tomorrow we put on the teacher.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.423
(PHONE BUZZING)

38:33.511 --> 38:36.361
Yes, right away.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.056
Adam wants to see us.

38:40.385 --> 38:41.485
Okay.

38:44.389 --> 38:46.999
OSBORN: Can a cop shoot
an unarmed black kid

38:47.058 --> 38:49.368
in the back
and walk away unscathed?

38:49.961 --> 38:53.501
I say, only in America
can they then charge

38:53.565 --> 38:55.735
his black friend
with that murder.

38:56.201 --> 38:59.551
Only in America
can the white justice system

38:59.771 --> 39:03.381
withhold evidence that would
indeed prove that he is innocent.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.507
Can anyone explain to me
what that's about?

39:11.850 --> 39:15.130
He must have found out that
James Gordon needed money

39:15.186 --> 39:16.926
to buy his girlfriend
a bracelet.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.058
Oh, that's the message.

39:19.991 --> 39:23.031
What Gordon wanted to do
with the money is irrelevant.

39:23.728 --> 39:24.728
I made a judgment call.

39:24.796 --> 39:29.576
When a decision can have an effect on
the perceived integrity of this office,

39:29.634 --> 39:31.744
nobody's judgment counts
but mine.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.653
Do you really think
I would cheat to win a case?

39:33.705 --> 39:34.835
Whatever I think,

39:34.906 --> 39:38.046
you're gonna have to do your dance in
front of Judge Larkin tomorrow morning.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.149
And if she finds against you,

39:40.211 --> 39:44.021
you'll be lucky if you're closing
up the office before lunch.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.916
OSBORN: Your Honor,
I personally know

39:49.988 --> 39:52.058
that the DA's office
is withholding evidence.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.363
This is ludicrous!

39:53.424 --> 39:56.894
Calm down, Mr. Osborn. We don't
need you to pop a blood vessel.

39:56.961 --> 40:00.811
I take it personally when opposing counsel
forgets that we have a constitution.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.335
Nothing in the Constitution
says

40:02.400 --> 40:04.740
that the state has to make the
defendant's case for him.

40:04.803 --> 40:05.943
OSBORN: Oh, is that right?

40:06.004 --> 40:08.514
I seem to recall something
about a fair trial,

40:08.573 --> 40:11.523
and a criminal defendant's
right thereto.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.316
Or does this only apply
to white defendants?

40:14.379 --> 40:16.879
You don't score any points
with sarcasm, Counselor.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.328
We don't have to score points,
Your Honor.

40:18.383 --> 40:21.233
We're the defense.
We're presumed innocent.

40:22.053 --> 40:25.693
And it seems the only way the
prosecution can rebut that presumption

40:25.757 --> 40:29.297
is to intentionally withhold...
Irrelevant and misleading evidence.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.140
I'm sorry, Counselor,
but in judge school

40:32.197 --> 40:36.667
they taught me it was my job to
decide what is or isn't relevant.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.935
That's exactly my point,
Your Honor.

40:39.003 --> 40:42.583
I'm entitled to a dismissal and
sanctions against both of them.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.350
Everybody wants to do
my job for me.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.520
You pushed
the envelope here, Jack.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.179
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:49.247 --> 40:53.217
But I can't say that what the
state did is per se unethical.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.529
You can put the girl
on the stand, Mr. Osborn.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.068
No harm done.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.337
I saw James every day
at school.

41:02.393 --> 41:06.433
We ate lunch together.
He was my friend.

41:07.031 --> 41:08.981
Did he ever give you presents?

41:09.167 --> 41:12.877
He painted a picture
and gave it to me.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.321
He bought me ice cream.

41:15.373 --> 41:18.483
He was always giving me things.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.583
Now, you just had a birthday,
didn't you?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.315
Yes.
Happy birthday.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.718
Did James ever say
he'd buy you a gift?

41:27.485 --> 41:28.485
Yes.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.564
A bracelet?

41:30.622 --> 41:33.662
I told him he didn't have to.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.302
It was too expensive.

41:37.362 --> 41:40.782
I just wanted him
to come to the party.

41:41.266 --> 41:44.176
But he said he was gonna
buy it anyway. Yes.

41:44.469 --> 41:48.379
How was James going to get the
money to buy that bracelet, Gwen?

41:48.439 --> 41:50.939
He said he had a way.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.993
Now, this is very important.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.446
Does James have a job?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.554
No.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.729
Thank you, Gwen.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.114
Did James ever tell you

42:15.800 --> 42:18.940
that he was going to steal the
money to get you a present?

42:19.003 --> 42:21.883
No, he's not like that.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.940
He wouldn't steal.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.552
I don't need
an ID bracelet that much.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.125
Now all we have to do is hope the
jury understands the difference

42:34.185 --> 42:36.125
between motive and intent.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.757
ADAM: Good luck.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.232
That's beyond most members
of the bar.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.659
The girl's testimony
killed you.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.208
JACK: On the other hand, Adam,
maybe it helped.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.676
James Gordon's teacher
told Claire

42:52.203 --> 42:55.623
he wanted her to teach him how
to spell his girlfriend's name.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.247
Gwen testified that James wanted
to buy her an ID bracelet.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.720
Which would have her name
printed on it.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.593
You think he already
bought the bracelet?

43:03.648 --> 43:06.188
If he did, he didn't have
motive or intent.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.685
Call Van Buren.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.766
I've got to talk to you.

43:16.828 --> 43:19.268
I told you on the phone
to stay away from me.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.500
You want absolution, lady,
go to church.

43:21.566 --> 43:24.306
You can help us convict
Zack Rowland.

43:24.368 --> 43:27.818
What makes you think I want to?
You killed my son, he didn't.

43:27.872 --> 43:29.442
It was an accident.

43:29.507 --> 43:32.387
Well, doesn't that make me
feel a whole lot better?

43:32.777 --> 43:34.717
Look, woman, you may be black,

43:35.279 --> 43:37.729
but you are a cop, and to me,
you are nothing but a killer.

43:37.782 --> 43:40.892
No better than anybody else who
shoots at kids and kills them.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.432
I know you're suffering, Mrs. Gordon...
Suffering?

43:43.488 --> 43:45.728
What do you know
about suffering?

43:45.857 --> 43:48.767
You lost a week's pay.
I lost my baby!

43:48.826 --> 43:51.066
And I know
you'll never get over it.

43:51.829 --> 43:53.569
I killed him, Mrs. Gordon,

43:53.831 --> 43:57.371
and I will never live a day
without that tearing me up.

43:58.202 --> 44:00.012
I work very hard
to be a good cop.

44:00.071 --> 44:02.021
I work very hard
to be a good mother.

44:02.073 --> 44:06.183
And what keeps me up at night,
what scares the hell out of me,

44:07.311 --> 44:10.451
is that none of it
may make any difference.

44:11.616 --> 44:16.356
I don't want to see any more of our
kids dying on the street, please.

44:17.188 --> 44:18.688
I need your help.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.543
If you know anything
about that bracelet,

44:22.760 --> 44:23.760
please...

44:52.824 --> 44:54.634
MARJORIE: I gave him
a dollar a week.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.025
He spent it on baseball cards.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.942
My brother tells me
he's got some valuable ones.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.822
He must've sold them
to get the money.

45:20.318 --> 45:21.658
"Guinevere."

45:36.934 --> 45:39.354
I heard Zack Rowland
cut a deal.

45:39.804 --> 45:42.844
Lieutenant, it's 9:00,

45:43.841 --> 45:48.721
I'm in a bar, I've got a glass of
eight-year-old scotch in front of me.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.660
I don't talk business.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.793
Tell me something, Counselor,

45:54.252 --> 45:55.992
were you born a wiseass,

45:56.354 --> 45:58.304
or did it just come
with the job?

45:58.423 --> 46:01.173
I'm a pussycat. You should
have seen my old man.

46:01.859 --> 46:03.169
Your old man?

46:03.227 --> 46:04.467
He was a cop.

46:05.263 --> 46:06.543
You knew that.

46:07.431 --> 46:11.471
If it had been him who was unlucky enough
to be in front of that ATM instead of you,

46:11.536 --> 46:15.676
there probably would have been two
dead kids lying on the sidewalk.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.878
And you would've dragged him
in front of the grand jury?

46:21.279 --> 46:22.619
Damn right.

46:24.849 --> 46:27.349
I would have
got an indictment, too.
