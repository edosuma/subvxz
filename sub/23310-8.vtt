WEBVTT

00:05.223 --> 00:05.931
I'm Frances Everdell.

00:05.931 --> 00:07.307
It's Skip,
nice to meet you.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.098
You too. And-- And-- Bye.

00:09.764 --> 00:11.348
We should officially
do business.

00:11.348 --> 00:13.598
I buy the houses
and you design and renovate.

00:13.598 --> 00:15.265
And we turn a tidy profit.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.806
Hate to say,
but I do like it.

00:17.473 --> 00:19.806
You loaned me money,
which I appreciate,

00:19.806 --> 00:21.598
but we're not actually partners.

00:22.432 --> 00:23.973
That prick from the auction,
he's here.

00:23.973 --> 00:25.223
Can I take you out
for dinner some time?

00:25.223 --> 00:27.473
I would feel impolite accepting
when I'm here

00:27.473 --> 00:28.307
with someone else.

00:28.598 --> 00:30.307
It's too soon
for me to be getting involved.

00:30.307 --> 00:31.723
Yeah, I think
my exact words were,

00:31.723 --> 00:33.848
you were a walking disaster.
And my instincts were right.

00:34.806 --> 00:36.514
Skip Zakarian wants to rep me.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.473
This means that
we won't be working together.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.598
You weren't even finishing
your paintings when I met you.

00:40.598 --> 00:42.681
Thanks for everything,
I'm done here.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.848
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:02.806 --> 01:04.182
Did you study
for your math final?

01:04.182 --> 01:06.473
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, you're so good.

01:06.473 --> 01:08.556
Yeah, he got out
the old abacus

01:08.556 --> 01:10.140
and kicked some butt.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.681
Mom, wait till you hear
about summer.

01:14.348 --> 01:16.015
What about--
what about summer?

01:17.098 --> 01:19.681
- Um...
- Thank you.

01:19.681 --> 01:24.639
You know, we, uh...
maybe hoping to...

01:24.639 --> 01:25.890
take the kids to Italy.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.848
- Yeah.

01:28.848 --> 01:31.140
With your permission,
of course.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.056
She's got
an old college roommate

01:33.056 --> 01:36.848
that made
a shitload of money
selling hair extensions

01:36.848 --> 01:39.223
and bought a villa--
in Italy.

01:39.223 --> 01:43.556
And even
has a
big fucking moat.

01:43.556 --> 01:47.307
And she's offered it
to us for free,

01:47.307 --> 01:51.056
um, you know, for June.

01:51.056 --> 01:51.973
And July.

01:51.973 --> 01:53.973
For June and

01:53.973 --> 01:56.182
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't want
to be without the kids

01:56.182 --> 01:58.223
for all of June and July.

01:58.223 --> 02:00.307
I mean,
summer's the only time
I have with them

02:00.307 --> 02:02.723
when they're not just...

02:02.723 --> 02:05.390
cranky all the time
from too little sleep.

02:05.390 --> 02:08.098
- You know.
- Yeah, but they've never
been to Europe.

02:08.098 --> 02:10.307
Well, I'm well aware
of that.

02:10.307 --> 02:12.390
As you know,
it has been my dream

02:12.390 --> 02:15.307
to take them,
and as you also well know,

02:15.307 --> 02:18.514
we haven't been able
to afford that.

02:21.432 --> 02:26.098
I'm sorry, but it's a no.

02:26.098 --> 02:28.681
And you should've told me
before you spoke to them

02:28.681 --> 02:32.890
because now--
shit, now I'm in this,
like, lousy position.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.432
Once again,
I'm the dream killer.

02:34.432 --> 02:36.307
Well, if the scarpe  fits.

02:36.307 --> 02:39.056
- That's "shoe" in Italian.
- Yes, it's-- yes, I know.

02:39.056 --> 02:42.806
- We were studying
last night, but, yeah.
Already?

02:42.806 --> 02:45.432
No worries.
You know, we'll-- okay.

02:45.432 --> 02:49.931
- Ciao,  which is
"good-bye" and "hello."
- Yeah, ciao,  as in Italian.

02:49.931 --> 02:51.514
- I know.
- Yeah.

02:51.514 --> 02:52.473
So,  ciao.

03:11.556 --> 03:14.307
What the fuck?

03:14.307 --> 03:16.681
Ugh, this is bullshit!

03:16.681 --> 03:18.015
I wish it were.

03:18.015 --> 03:19.723
Where's the part
about you finding her

03:19.723 --> 03:21.182
and us
launching her career, huh?

03:21.182 --> 03:22.890
- Oh, nowhere.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.473
Nowhere. I am
officially scrubbed

03:25.473 --> 03:27.140
from her entire history.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.307
I never
trusted that Sylvia,
but Skip?

03:30.307 --> 03:32.223
I went to St. Barts
with Skip.

03:32.223 --> 03:33.598
He was, like, my pal.

03:33.598 --> 03:35.098
Well, your pal is taking

03:35.098 --> 03:37.265
every ounce of credit
for Sylvia.

03:37.265 --> 03:38.931
Yeah, and all
our future profits.

03:38.931 --> 03:40.390
I'm like training wheels.

03:40.390 --> 03:43.056
I get them started,
I give them a little shove,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.265
and then they ride off

03:44.265 --> 03:45.639
on their
brand-new two-wheelers

03:45.639 --> 03:47.265
into the sunset without me.

03:47.265 --> 03:49.764
Oh, and get this--
Robert and Jackie

03:49.764 --> 03:51.931
want to take the kids
to Europe this summer.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.848
- That's great.
- No, it's not great,
Diane, it's not.

03:54.848 --> 03:58.348
I don't want to spend
the whole summer alone
without them.

03:58.348 --> 03:59.514
Oh, my God, please.

03:59.514 --> 04:00.514
If I had kids, all I'd want

04:00.514 --> 04:02.015
was a long break from them.

04:02.015 --> 04:04.348
Well, then
it's probably good

04:04.348 --> 04:06.265
you never had them.

04:06.265 --> 04:09.973
Yeah. You know
what, Frances?

04:09.973 --> 04:13.681
Maybe Sylvia and Robert
were like training wheels
for you, you know?

04:13.681 --> 04:14.848
It's like when
I was working

04:14.848 --> 04:16.723
at the glove counter
at Saks

04:16.723 --> 04:19.681
and living
in that tiny studio
in the East 50s.

04:19.681 --> 04:20.890
I just loved my life.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.223
And then I met Nick

04:22.223 --> 04:24.432
and my life got
even bigger and better!

04:24.432 --> 04:26.390
So you just
don't know, Frances.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.348
You don't know
what the future holds.

04:28.348 --> 04:32.598
Apparently, it holds
a lot of blank walls.

04:32.598 --> 04:35.223
I'm just gonna be glad
to get these Sylvias
out of here

04:35.223 --> 04:36.348
and to their new owners.

04:37.764 --> 04:39.098
Who's that?

04:39.098 --> 04:40.931
Oh, some kid
up the road did it.

04:40.931 --> 04:42.681
I didn't have the heart
to tell him

04:42.681 --> 04:44.098
that it looked like
one of those elephants

04:44.098 --> 04:45.098
holding a paintbrush
made it.

04:46.265 --> 04:48.973
- Diane.

04:48.973 --> 04:52.390
You know what?
I like it.

04:52.390 --> 04:57.265
It's bright, it's happy,
I don't love it.

04:57.265 --> 04:59.639
Can't hurt me.
I'm borrowing it.

04:59.639 --> 05:01.723
Please, thank God.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.473
Motherfucker!

05:14.931 --> 05:17.514
- Man: Certainly.

05:17.514 --> 05:20.307
Frances. It's good
to see you.

05:20.307 --> 05:23.265
Really? Is it
good to see me?

05:23.265 --> 05:26.265
'Cause I have some things
to say to you, asshole.

05:26.265 --> 05:28.432
Well, okay, you're--
you're coming in hot.

05:28.432 --> 05:33.931
Maybe poaching Sylvia
was some sort of pathetic
dick swing payback

05:33.931 --> 05:35.723
for my declining
your dinner invitation.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.848
- It wasn't.
- Okay, well, regardless,

05:37.848 --> 05:40.973
it was a full-on
shady thing to do.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.432
So, I'm gonna--
gonna give you

05:42.432 --> 05:44.514
a little background--
a little history, okay?

05:44.514 --> 05:49.348
When I met Sylvia,
she was in a total
artistic coma.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.890
I worked with her
and I sure as hell
didn't do it

05:51.890 --> 05:57.140
so that you could show up
in your fancy car service
one night and steal her.

05:57.140 --> 05:58.723
I mean,
is that what you do?

05:58.723 --> 06:01.473
Pretty much, yes.

06:01.473 --> 06:04.182
- Wow, how-- how
do you sleep at night?
- Look, I don't have the eye

06:04.182 --> 06:06.473
or, frankly, the energy
to do what you do.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.056
I wish I did.

06:08.056 --> 06:09.848
But once an artist
is on my radar,

06:09.848 --> 06:11.307
I can sell
the shit out of them.

06:11.307 --> 06:12.639
I know what people want,

06:12.639 --> 06:14.265
I know how much money
these people have,

06:14.265 --> 06:15.806
and I know where
they've parked their yachts.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.556
So, the way I see it,
you can go on

06:17.556 --> 06:19.639
having people like me
steal your artists

06:19.639 --> 06:23.307
or we could discuss
working together.

06:23.307 --> 06:24.556
Are you serious?

06:24.556 --> 06:26.473
You fuck me over
and then you expect me

06:26.473 --> 06:28.681
to go into business
with you?

06:28.681 --> 06:31.514
- Oh, that's rich.
- Hey, you can stay
in your sleepy little hamlet

06:31.514 --> 06:34.890
and watch people leave you
or you can move forward.

06:34.890 --> 06:35.848
That's my two cents.

06:36.931 --> 06:38.348
Unbelievable.

06:38.348 --> 06:42.764
Oh, and, uh, here.

06:42.764 --> 06:46.598
You can keep your two cents
and your pricey trinket.

06:46.598 --> 06:47.848
I'm not for sale.

06:50.265 --> 06:51.556
Call me
if you want to talk.

06:51.556 --> 06:53.473
Jesus.

06:53.473 --> 06:56.764
Woman:
So, all profits
on future investments

06:56.764 --> 06:58.348
are split 50-50.

06:58.348 --> 07:01.348
- Yep.
- All righty, if you both sign

07:01.348 --> 07:06.348
at the bottom,
your real estate partnership
is finalized.

07:06.348 --> 07:09.307
Check that out.
What a signature.

07:09.307 --> 07:10.556
You should've seen it
in high school.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.681
It actually included
a smiley face.

07:12.681 --> 07:14.223
- Aw.

07:14.223 --> 07:16.639
- Well, congratulations...
- That's sweet.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.265
...you are now
a corporation.

07:18.265 --> 07:20.556
And if I could just say,

07:20.556 --> 07:22.890
- you two are adorable.
- Oh.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.307
- You're pretty cute
yourself, Michelle.
- Michelle: Well, thank you.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.098
And you work well together.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.598
These agreements
are difficult,

07:28.598 --> 07:29.890
believe you me.

07:29.890 --> 07:31.390
Basically, it's like
doing a prenup,

07:31.390 --> 07:34.265
but you guys just
breezed on through.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.348
- Oh, thank you.

07:51.556 --> 07:53.556
Shit.

07:55.098 --> 07:56.598
Come on.

08:03.764 --> 08:04.931
Oh, my--

08:09.015 --> 08:11.639
Oh! Oh, my God.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.723
Holy shit.

08:21.806 --> 08:23.514
Thanks for coming.

08:23.514 --> 08:24.890
I didn't know
who else to call.

08:24.890 --> 08:26.140
Plumbers.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.056
- This is their profession.

08:28.056 --> 08:29.764
Just throwing it out there.

08:29.764 --> 08:31.848
Of course.
Yeah, no, it's better
to call a plumber,

08:31.848 --> 08:34.390
but I panicked,
'cause that was, like,
shooting at me sideways.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.639
Oh, and by the way,
we have no water pressure
in the upstairs shower

08:37.639 --> 08:39.639
and that was
like a fire hose.

08:39.639 --> 08:41.307
If that's a veiled attempt
to get me to fix

08:41.307 --> 08:43.432
the showerhead,
no way, José.

08:43.432 --> 08:45.973
Oh, no, no,
just this one job, sir.

08:47.556 --> 08:49.931
'Cause you know this house
better than anyone.

08:49.931 --> 08:52.931
This house and I
have been through
many  emotional highs

08:52.931 --> 08:55.639
and lows together.

08:55.639 --> 08:58.598
Hey, so, what,
your-- your fella

08:58.598 --> 08:59.973
not available
to come help?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.140
He's not my fella.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.681
- And we're done.
Copy that.

09:05.681 --> 09:07.056
Seemed like
a nice guy, though.

09:07.056 --> 09:10.140
Except for, you know,
those weird sweater-vests.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.307
He did not
wear sweater-vests.

09:12.307 --> 09:14.723
In his soul,
he was wearing
a sweater-vest.

09:14.723 --> 09:18.432
- No.
- Oh, reminds me.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.973
I have something for you.

09:23.015 --> 09:23.890
Here you go.

09:28.473 --> 09:30.140
$75,000?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.723
Finally started
to make some money
on these flip houses.

09:32.723 --> 09:35.348
And I just wanted
to pay you back.

09:35.348 --> 09:37.681
'Cause, you know,
you supported me--

09:37.681 --> 09:41.307
well, the family--
for so long.

09:42.639 --> 09:43.848
Really long time.

09:43.848 --> 09:45.598
You trying to buy me
off so you can take

09:45.598 --> 09:46.723
the kids this summer?

09:46.723 --> 09:49.307
Jesus. Just say thanks

09:49.307 --> 09:51.556
and invest in a new pipe.

09:52.681 --> 09:54.056
Thank you.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.806
Really... thank you.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.764
And congratulations on...

10:01.764 --> 10:04.307
you know, the houses,
on everything.

10:04.307 --> 10:06.432
Thanks. It feels good.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.098
It's really weird,
I never imagined

10:11.098 --> 10:14.098
when we first
bought this place...

10:14.098 --> 10:17.140
you know,
that we wouldn't be...

10:17.140 --> 10:18.473
- Yeah.
- Huh, it's weird.

10:18.473 --> 10:21.348
I thought
I would drop dead
in this house.

10:21.348 --> 10:23.890
- Do you ever wonder,

10:23.890 --> 10:27.348
like... what if we met
each other now?

10:28.556 --> 10:31.973
You mean if New Frances
met New Robert?

10:31.973 --> 10:33.723
Yeah. Yeah.

10:33.723 --> 10:35.931
- I think we'd have
a lot of laughs.
- Yeah.

10:35.931 --> 10:38.806
Mostly at the expense
of-- of Old Frances.

10:38.806 --> 10:43.681
- Hi, I'm Frances.

10:43.681 --> 10:45.973
- Swifty.

10:45.973 --> 10:49.473
New Robert
gets to call himself
whatever he wants.

10:58.973 --> 11:00.598
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh.

11:00.598 --> 11:03.098
- I'm so sorry. Oh.
- I can't do it again.

11:03.098 --> 11:05.265
- No, of course not. It--
- I'm with Jackie.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.265
No, I-- I know that.
I know that.

11:08.265 --> 11:09.931
I'm sorry.

11:19.432 --> 11:21.265
Diane:
I don't know, Frances,
that whole Skip idea

11:21.265 --> 11:22.598
sounds kind of tempting.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.806
- We could team up with him

11:23.806 --> 11:25.015
and make a killing,
come on!

11:25.015 --> 11:27.182
I don't want
to make a killing!

11:27.182 --> 11:30.140
I want to enjoy what I do.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.973
You know,
I used to enjoy art.

11:32.973 --> 11:36.307
This whole Sylvia business
has just--

11:36.307 --> 11:38.848
has left a very bad taste
in my mouth.

11:38.848 --> 11:41.056
All right,
forget about business
and we can have some fun.

11:41.056 --> 11:43.432
Hey, you're coming
to our Memorial Day barbecue
this Sunday, right?

11:43.432 --> 11:45.307
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Yay!

11:45.307 --> 11:47.307
Oh, and Nick invited
Robert and Jackie.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.639
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:50.639 --> 11:52.556
No, we're good, so, yeah,
there's no worries there--

11:52.556 --> 11:57.806
Whoa wait.
This reminds me. Um... here.

11:58.848 --> 11:59.806
I want you to have this.

12:02.140 --> 12:03.723
A check made out to you?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.390
Well, no, I mean,
Robert made it out to me,

12:05.390 --> 12:07.307
and I endorsed it to you.

12:07.307 --> 12:10.681
See? It's to pay you back.

12:10.681 --> 12:12.806
- For the gallery loan.
- Oh!

12:12.806 --> 12:15.015
I mean, I can't think
of no better recipient
than you.

12:15.015 --> 12:16.973
You've done
so much for me, Diane.

12:16.973 --> 12:20.015
- So thank you.
- You don't have
to do this, Frances.

12:20.015 --> 12:23.890
No, I-- I want to do it.
I'm proud to do it.

12:25.056 --> 12:28.307
Oh, I see.
So this is how it ends.

12:28.307 --> 12:29.598
Wait, what?

12:29.598 --> 12:31.848
Now that
the dreadful Pelts
is gone,

12:31.848 --> 12:33.848
you just don't have
any more use for me.

12:33.848 --> 12:35.681
No, Diane,
please don't make this

12:35.681 --> 12:37.056
something that it isn't,
all right?

12:37.056 --> 12:39.140
I-- I have been
telling you for so long

12:39.140 --> 12:40.348
that I'm gonna pay
you back

12:40.348 --> 12:41.432
and I feel like
you just chose

12:41.432 --> 12:42.890
to not hear me.

12:42.890 --> 12:46.681
I'm giving you money.
It's a good thing.

12:46.681 --> 12:48.390
Yeah, for you, I guess.

12:48.390 --> 12:51.848
- Oh, come on. Diane!
- No.

12:51.848 --> 12:55.556
You wanted to do
the gallery alone,
now I want to be alone.

12:55.556 --> 12:57.098
- Yeah.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.182
Don't try and stop me.

12:59.432 --> 13:02.514
- Okay.
- You can Uber home!

13:02.514 --> 13:06.182
I-- there's no service.

13:07.890 --> 13:10.265
Oh, come on. Diane!

13:12.056 --> 13:13.265
Good.

13:13.265 --> 13:14.723
You know what would be fun
to do in Italy?

13:14.723 --> 13:16.098
Buy leather.

13:16.098 --> 13:18.890
Yes!

13:18.890 --> 13:20.390
Get married.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.265
Wait, what?

13:22.806 --> 13:25.598
You know,
that butterscotch candy
lawyer was right.

13:25.598 --> 13:28.265
I mean,
we did the hard work.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.764
And-- and we work together.

13:30.764 --> 13:32.223
Really well.

13:32.223 --> 13:35.223
I know it's really fast...

13:35.223 --> 13:38.514
but my marriage lasted
a long time and look where
that ended up.

13:38.514 --> 13:39.473
I mean,
life's short, Jackie.

13:40.931 --> 13:43.931
I don't remember
what that quote was

13:43.931 --> 13:46.390
from that inspirational,
cheesy poster,

13:46.390 --> 13:50.432
but... I want
my future to start.

13:53.598 --> 13:54.723
Today.

13:57.931 --> 14:00.432
You're asking me
to marry you.

14:02.432 --> 14:03.764
Will you marry me?

14:05.848 --> 14:08.265
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah.

14:09.514 --> 14:10.639
Oh!

14:12.140 --> 14:14.723
- Say it again!
- Man: Fuck Frances.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.182
- Say it again!
- Fuck Frances!

14:17.182 --> 14:19.432
I was the best
goddamn partner
she ever had.

14:19.432 --> 14:21.639
I knew her peccadilloes,
her needs,

14:21.639 --> 14:23.681
and let me
tell you something, Dwayne,

14:23.681 --> 14:27.639
this lady is not
a walk in the park.

14:27.639 --> 14:29.681
- Fuck her!
- Thank you, Dwayne.

14:29.681 --> 14:31.015
And I wanna tell
you something--

14:31.015 --> 14:31.973
I really like you.

14:31.973 --> 14:33.890
You're a good person.

14:33.890 --> 14:36.265
May I buy you a new cap?

14:37.348 --> 14:38.723
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.140
But first,
we need another round.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.973
- Okay.
- Barkeep, can I have
two more 7 and 7s?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.973
Ma'am, you've had enough.

14:48.973 --> 14:50.973
- Ooh.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.390
Ma'am!

14:55.973 --> 14:57.681
Fuck you!

14:57.681 --> 15:02.348
You can't kick me out
because I'm choosing  to go!

15:06.348 --> 15:09.639
Bullshit. Fuck you,
I'm out of here.

15:09.639 --> 15:12.848
- Fuck you!

15:18.848 --> 15:21.098
Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you!

15:26.140 --> 15:28.098
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.015
♪ Your love ♪

15:30.015 --> 15:32.723
- ♪ Belongs
under a rock... ♪
- Oh!

15:32.723 --> 15:35.015
Hey, it's--

15:35.015 --> 15:39.056
Oh, Diane, come on.

15:39.056 --> 15:40.681
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

15:40.681 --> 15:42.390
Huh. What was that about?

15:42.390 --> 15:44.223
I paid her back
for the gallery loan,

15:44.223 --> 15:46.390
and you'd think
I killed her mother.

15:46.390 --> 15:48.432
Oh. Well,
she loathes her mother.

15:48.432 --> 15:49.848
She'd probably
welcome that.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.098
- Well--
- Tequila, extra lime.

15:52.098 --> 15:53.056
You're the best.

15:53.056 --> 15:54.973
- Ted, this is Frances.
- Hi.

15:54.973 --> 15:56.556
Oh, yes,
the tennis partner.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.307
- We finally meet.
- You don't have a drink.

15:58.307 --> 15:59.848
- Yes, I do.

15:59.848 --> 16:00.931
- Here, I insist.
- Oh.

16:00.931 --> 16:02.723
That's very nice of you.

16:02.723 --> 16:06.390
You're a real gentleman.
Thank you very much.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.182
I'll be right back
with more reinforcements.

16:11.598 --> 16:13.307
Well, well, well.

16:13.307 --> 16:17.973
- Kissing partners.
- I know, he's a child.

16:17.973 --> 16:20.973
He's adorable,
he's delightful.

16:20.973 --> 16:22.556
Who cares how old he is?

16:22.556 --> 16:25.015
You deserve
to have some fun.

16:25.015 --> 16:26.973
I'm happy for you
and for him.

16:26.973 --> 16:29.015
You know who else
is happy for him?

16:29.015 --> 16:31.764
- His ex-wife,
who still lives with him.

16:31.764 --> 16:33.390
- They're besties.

16:33.390 --> 16:35.556
Really. How can people
in their 30s

16:35.556 --> 16:37.056
have more
complicated lives than us?

16:38.681 --> 16:40.764
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna skedaddle
to the corn dogs.

16:40.764 --> 16:42.098
Oh, okay, all right.

16:42.098 --> 16:43.973
I'll talk to--

16:47.098 --> 16:49.265
I think Frances
just ran away from us.

16:49.265 --> 16:52.598
Yeah, she was a sprinter
in college.

16:52.598 --> 16:55.556
Hey, uh,
have you told her yet?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.514
What, about you and me?

16:57.514 --> 16:59.473
No, about
my fucking quiche recipe.

16:59.473 --> 17:00.973
Robbie!

17:00.973 --> 17:03.639
Yes, I was planning on
telling her later.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.556
I just thought that,
you know,

17:05.556 --> 17:08.556
once we had partaken
in punch

17:08.556 --> 17:12.140
and fellowship
and, uh-- and fireworks.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.432
You have
to tell her today, okay?

17:14.432 --> 17:15.931
You owe that to her.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.098
And we can't tell the kids
until you tell her.

17:18.098 --> 17:20.390
Oh, Jesus,
it's a house of cards.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.931
Have you told anyone?

17:21.931 --> 17:23.473
Like, a friend?

17:23.473 --> 17:25.265
I told my mother
and I booked the camel

17:25.265 --> 17:26.265
I'm riding in on.

17:26.265 --> 17:27.390
One of those things is a lie.

17:27.390 --> 17:30.307
Hello, my friends,
welcome, welcome.

17:30.307 --> 17:32.307
God bless
our fallen troops

17:32.307 --> 17:34.473
and don't miss
the sangria bar.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.556
What news do you bring
from the outside world?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.015
- Jackie and I
are getting married, Nick.
- Oh, fuck!

17:39.015 --> 17:40.015
- Nick: No kidding!
- Ah!

17:40.015 --> 17:41.348
That's fantastic.

17:41.348 --> 17:43.639
Oh, my God,
that's amazing news!

17:46.056 --> 17:49.348
We so love it
when our young people
get married.

17:49.348 --> 17:50.890
You know, Diane and I
have been married

17:50.890 --> 17:52.681
nearly 11 years now

17:52.681 --> 17:54.848
and, her murder attempt
aside, I just--

17:54.848 --> 17:58.390
I couldn't recommend
the institution more.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.890
Oh, that's great news.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.514
- Great.
- Thank you.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.806
- Um, well,

18:05.806 --> 18:08.806
but we actually were hoping

18:08.806 --> 18:10.223
we could just keep this
all between us.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.681
- Mmm.
- Robert: Haven't really spoke

18:11.681 --> 18:13.265
to the masses just yet,

18:13.265 --> 18:16.514
which mainly and namely
involves Frances.

18:16.514 --> 18:18.973
Your secret's safe with me.

18:18.973 --> 18:22.681
Norman, how's the knee,
you cocksucker?

18:23.931 --> 18:25.307
You wanted me
to tell somebody.

18:25.307 --> 18:26.973
You have to go tell her.
Right now!

18:26.973 --> 18:29.182
- Fuck.

18:29.182 --> 18:31.265
Diane:
Michael, I noticed that
many of the people outside

18:31.265 --> 18:33.598
aren't eating food,
so make sure to pass
the food sticks around

18:33.598 --> 18:35.723
to the outside people,
'cause I want them
to get eaten.

18:35.723 --> 18:36.973
Thank you, Michael.

18:36.973 --> 18:39.223
Diane, can-- can we talk
about this, please?

18:39.223 --> 18:42.348
Mm, I have
some real friends
to entertain, so excuse me.

18:42.348 --> 18:44.473
Oh, my God,
this is ridiculous.

18:47.639 --> 18:50.848
I am mortified and I really
don't want to rehash it

18:50.848 --> 18:53.265
any more than
I already have in my head.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.723
You're with Jackie.
I get it.

18:59.390 --> 19:01.348
Fuck.

19:01.348 --> 19:05.514
Hello, hello,
hello, hello!

19:07.432 --> 19:09.556
What a great day.
Start of summer.

19:10.598 --> 19:12.806
Full of so much possibility.

19:14.015 --> 19:17.432
Like the daffodils
and Jesus,

19:17.432 --> 19:18.973
I, too, have been reborn...

19:18.973 --> 19:20.764
- ...these last few months

19:20.764 --> 19:23.307
spending time
with lovely Diane

19:23.307 --> 19:25.556
here in our magical home.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.598
Oh, I feel the same.

19:27.598 --> 19:30.015
- Nick: And as many
of you know,

19:30.015 --> 19:33.265
I am prone
to the passive-aggressive
speech.

19:33.265 --> 19:36.514
- Diane: Yes.
- But this one is just
aggressive-aggressive.

19:36.514 --> 19:39.140
I love this woman!
To Diane!

19:39.140 --> 19:41.723
All:
Diane!

19:41.723 --> 19:44.390
- And I'm three sangrias in,

19:44.390 --> 19:47.723
so, uh, forgive me
my trespasses,

19:47.723 --> 19:51.223
but, uh, I can't keep it
to myself.

19:51.223 --> 19:55.223
I have some very
exciting news to share.

19:55.223 --> 19:57.307
- Fuck.

19:57.307 --> 20:00.598
Norman is fully healed
from the ACL surgery.

20:00.598 --> 20:02.307
He's gonna be back
out there on the links

20:02.307 --> 20:05.639
stealing our money
by June 1st. Norman!

20:12.432 --> 20:14.432
Robert:
Frances, we need to talk.

20:14.432 --> 20:17.890
Robert, I can-- I could really
use some space right now.

20:17.890 --> 20:20.098
- Seriously.
- No, I understand that,

20:20.098 --> 20:21.764
but it would  behoove  us

20:21.764 --> 20:23.806
if you would just
open the door

20:23.806 --> 20:25.140
so we could talk.

20:32.265 --> 20:36.514
- Diane! There's a line!
- The jig is up.

20:36.514 --> 20:38.223
- The police are here.

20:38.223 --> 20:41.514
- They're here for me!
- I highly doubt that.

20:43.931 --> 20:46.182
Robert:
Oh, shit.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.098
Listen, Frances,
that night we fought,

20:48.098 --> 20:49.639
I may have gotten
totally drunk,

20:49.639 --> 20:51.973
I may have
sideswiped some cars.

20:51.973 --> 20:54.556
There were clearly cameras,
they clearly fingered me.

20:54.556 --> 20:56.764
Jesus, well,
did you hurt anyone?

20:56.764 --> 20:59.015
- I don't recall.
- Oh, my God.

20:59.015 --> 21:00.390
I was so sad, Frances.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.056
My only friend that night
was the bottle.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.182
I mean
that's a little dramatic.

21:04.182 --> 21:05.931
I'm-- I'm your friend,
Diane.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.056
I promise you,
I am still your friend,

21:08.056 --> 21:10.639
and if you want to give
that check back to me,

21:10.639 --> 21:12.390
that is completely okay.

21:12.390 --> 21:13.806
I just don't want it

21:13.806 --> 21:15.639
to screw up
our relationship.

21:15.639 --> 21:17.348
I can't because
I may have accidentally

21:17.348 --> 21:18.390
flushed it down the toilet

21:18.390 --> 21:20.848
of some dive bar
in Peekskill.

21:20.848 --> 21:24.723
- Okay, then.
- But I accept your apology.

21:24.723 --> 21:26.223
Well, thanks.

21:26.223 --> 21:28.223
I really need
a friend, Frances.

21:28.223 --> 21:31.390
I need you to help me
turn myself in to the po-po.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.723
All right.
Okay, let's go.

21:33.723 --> 21:35.598
I told you to stop
having parties.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.432
Robert:
He's my bro, man.

21:37.432 --> 21:39.598
- I deserve to know
what he's done.
- Ow, ow!

21:39.598 --> 21:40.806
Excuse me,
officers, officers.

21:40.806 --> 21:42.056
Excuse me, you have
the wrong person.

21:42.056 --> 21:43.307
It was I who committed
the crime

21:43.307 --> 21:44.723
and-- and I shall
make it right.

21:44.723 --> 21:45.848
- It was me.

21:45.848 --> 21:47.348
You embezzled $12 million

21:47.348 --> 21:48.514
from your clients?

21:50.265 --> 21:52.848
Nick:
This is not the worst party
we've ever had.

21:52.848 --> 21:55.432
Diane! Diane,
I love you, Diane.

21:55.432 --> 21:58.140
Oh, my God.
Oh, Nick.

22:03.639 --> 22:05.265
Jackie and I
are getting married.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.890
He was lying
the whole time.

22:12.890 --> 22:14.348
He wasn't in retirement,
he was in hiding!

22:14.348 --> 22:16.723
Ugh, I'm Ruth Madoff.

22:16.723 --> 22:18.432
I'm gonna be penniless
and scorned

22:18.432 --> 22:20.931
and have to go live
with my sister in Boca.

22:20.931 --> 22:22.098
Sweetie,
you aren't penniless.

22:22.098 --> 22:23.598
You have a $2 million Pelts

22:23.598 --> 22:26.890
and $75,000 in a toilet
somewhere in Peekskill.

22:26.890 --> 22:30.639
Robert is engaged?
What the fuck is that?

22:30.639 --> 22:32.598
- No.

22:32.598 --> 22:33.473
No, I did not.

22:34.598 --> 22:35.806
Are you okay?

22:35.806 --> 22:39.639
Honestly, uh...
I don't know.

22:39.639 --> 22:41.307
I mean, of course,
one of us was

22:41.307 --> 22:43.514
gonna move on, but engaged?

22:43.514 --> 22:45.681
This fast?
I mean, I--

22:45.681 --> 22:48.639
I still have
old pants of his
in the attic.

22:51.639 --> 22:55.015
Oh, my God.
Do you think
she's pregnant?

22:56.223 --> 22:57.432
I mean, she's definitely

22:57.432 --> 22:58.639
young enough to have a baby.

22:58.639 --> 23:00.390
Anyone can.

23:00.390 --> 23:03.639
Please, there are
65-year-old grandmothers
having babies now.

23:05.015 --> 23:08.556
Well, that would at least
explain it.

23:08.556 --> 23:10.764
My God, how do I keep
missing these things? Aah.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.890
I'm like the poster child
for being blindsided.

23:15.890 --> 23:18.473
Sylvia, Robert, it's...

23:19.639 --> 23:21.973
Thought
you might need this.

23:21.973 --> 23:23.681
- Thank you.
- You're a doll.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.764
That little Ted
is adorable.

23:29.764 --> 23:31.307
He's mine.

23:31.307 --> 23:32.639
And his ex-wife's.

23:33.723 --> 23:34.848
That's true.

23:46.931 --> 23:49.390
- Robert: Hi.
- Hey.

23:49.390 --> 23:52.473
Closing at 11:00.
Strong work ethic.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.015
I'm driving Diane
into the city to see Nick.

23:55.015 --> 23:56.056
- In jail.
- Oh.

23:56.056 --> 23:58.432
Did

23:59.556 --> 24:00.764
About what he was doing?

24:00.764 --> 24:03.265
No. No, I was completely
in the dark.

24:06.056 --> 24:07.848
A lot of bombshells lately.

24:07.848 --> 24:09.598
Hey, look, Frances.

24:09.598 --> 24:10.890
About that.

24:12.307 --> 24:15.390
Yesterday-- it's not
how I meant to tell you.

24:15.390 --> 24:19.890
It's-- it's not how
I wanted you to find out
about Jackie and I.

24:21.432 --> 24:24.890
Wouldn't be
my preferred choice, either.

24:24.890 --> 24:25.931
I panicked.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.390
It's as simple as that.

24:29.390 --> 24:30.848
I'm not proud of it.

24:33.182 --> 24:38.432
Is she...
you know, is she pregnant?

24:39.556 --> 24:41.265
Oh, God, no.

24:41.265 --> 24:42.432
No.

24:45.265 --> 24:46.390
You happy?

24:47.556 --> 24:48.723
I am.

24:51.348 --> 24:52.598
I can't be late
for visiting hours.

24:59.556 --> 25:01.432
You sure you're okay
to go in alone?

25:01.432 --> 25:03.723
Yes, of course.

25:03.723 --> 25:05.764
Go enjoy
your nonincarcerated day.

25:09.681 --> 25:11.432
I'll meet you
back here at 3:00.

25:11.432 --> 25:13.223
- Okay.
- 3:00.

25:13.223 --> 25:16.098
- Man: Keep moving.

25:28.806 --> 25:30.473
Could we move
this along, ma'am?

25:30.473 --> 25:33.639
You'll get it all back
on the other side
of the screening.

25:33.639 --> 25:36.056
Says you.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.348
Woman:
Hurry up.

25:38.931 --> 25:41.015
Diane, you look so lovely.

25:41.015 --> 25:44.473
- You look so orange.
- Darling, I'm sorry.

25:44.473 --> 25:47.307
I never meant to drag you
into all of this.

25:47.307 --> 25:50.390
I got carried away
and I will pay the price.

25:50.390 --> 25:53.307
Are we poor now?

25:54.432 --> 25:55.890
Define poor.

25:55.890 --> 25:57.556
I mean,
I know I have the Pelts,

25:57.556 --> 26:00.015
but it would break my heart
to have to sell it.

26:00.015 --> 26:02.639
But what else?
Are-- are there
accounts somewhere?

26:02.639 --> 26:04.056
Like, somewhere top secret?

26:04.056 --> 26:07.140
Maybe just use hand signals
so no one can hear

26:07.140 --> 26:10.015
- what we're talking about.
- Diane, they're going

26:10.015 --> 26:11.514
to seize the Pelts.

26:11.514 --> 26:14.931
- Well, it was my money
that bought it.

26:14.931 --> 26:17.015
Or more accurately,
the Zucker family

26:17.015 --> 26:18.639
trust's money, but still.

26:18.639 --> 26:19.639
How could you
do this to me?

26:20.890 --> 26:24.973
To us? I never
needed the money.

26:24.973 --> 26:27.348
- I fucking loved you!
- Diane, pick up the phone.

26:27.348 --> 26:30.432
- Fuck you!
- Diane, pick up--
pick up the phone.

26:30.432 --> 26:31.973
- Fuck you!
- Diane, don't do that now.

26:31.973 --> 26:34.265
- Fuck you!
- Not in front of the guys!

26:34.265 --> 26:36.764
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- Diane, calm--

26:36.764 --> 26:38.931
- Fuck you!
- Come with me, ma'am.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.598
I'm not a ma'am!

26:40.598 --> 26:42.348
Wait for me, Diane!

27:53.056 --> 27:54.723
Is that yours?

27:54.723 --> 27:56.432
Yeah, that one's
actually my favorite.

27:56.432 --> 27:58.098
It's mine, too.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.056
Um, I have a gallery

28:04.056 --> 28:05.806
if-- if you ever
want to chat.

28:05.806 --> 28:07.390
- Cool.

28:07.390 --> 28:09.973
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:09.973 --> 28:12.140
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks. Enjoy the rest
of the show.

28:30.931 --> 28:32.265
Robert:
This is Robert.

28:32.265 --> 28:33.514
Leave your message
at the tone.

28:34.473 --> 28:36.432
Oh, hey, it's me.

28:36.432 --> 28:41.098
Um, s-- so, yeah,
so take the kids to Italy.

28:41.098 --> 28:44.598
Um, but please show them
more than gelato shops.

28:44.598 --> 28:48.931
Show them...
show them Caravaggio
and Titian

28:48.931 --> 28:51.848
and the Duomo
in Florence, okay?

28:53.015 --> 28:55.681
Um, yeah.

28:55.681 --> 29:00.514
And congratulations
to you and Jackie.

29:00.514 --> 29:01.806
Okay, bye.

29:10.514 --> 29:11.681
Woman:
Hello.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.556
Hi. Can I help you
with anything?

29:28.556 --> 29:30.390
Yes, are you hiring?

29:34.348 --> 29:35.265
Bye.

29:59.015 --> 30:00.056
Mmm!

30:03.514 --> 30:05.056
- Have fun.
- Okay.

30:05.056 --> 30:06.182
Okay?

30:07.348 --> 30:08.598
- Bye.
- Bye.
