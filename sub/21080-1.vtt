00:17.717 --> 00:22.586
##

00:37.537 --> 00:38.936
man: Ungrateful...

00:39.005 --> 00:41.269
unholy...

00:41.341 --> 00:43.036
without self-control.

00:44.644 --> 00:45.770
Brutal.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.473
Not lovers of good...

00:48.548 --> 00:51.415
conceited...

00:52.552 --> 00:55.646
Have nothing
to do with them.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.189
Nothing.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.526
There will be terrible times
in the last days.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.153
People will become...

01:04.230 --> 01:07.222
Iovers of themselves,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.768
Iovers of money...

01:09.836 --> 01:12.236
boastful...

01:12.305 --> 01:15.331
proud...

01:15.408 --> 01:19.845
having a form of godliness,
but denying its power.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.274
And another upsetting thing
about these days of ours

01:25.351 --> 01:26.978
is the lack of respect

01:27.053 --> 01:30.819
that young people have
for their bodies.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.155
We must take
control of that.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.094
We must teach our children

01:37.163 --> 01:38.755
that God has not placed
them here

01:38.832 --> 01:40.891
just to
pleasure themselves.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.298
Amen.

01:44.003 --> 01:47.097
And that unclean thoughts

01:47.173 --> 01:48.970
are just as much a sin
in the eyes of God

01:49.042 --> 01:50.873
as the acts themselves.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.007
Isn't that right,
Rebecca?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.950
Shall we show everyone
what happens to those

02:01.020 --> 02:04.012
with unclean thoughts?

02:04.090 --> 02:06.684
Those who have given in
to the temptation?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.863
Those who put their
needs above God's will?

02:17.770 --> 02:18.862
Come, my dear.

02:20.573 --> 02:21.699
Let us show them.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.089
What?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.724
Isn't somebody
gonna help her?!

02:52.205 --> 02:54.298
It's all right, Rebecca.

02:54.374 --> 02:55.705
You're still pure.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.869
You have failed yourself

02:59.946 --> 03:02.005
and you have
failed God.

03:02.081 --> 03:05.244
May he have
mercy on your soul.

03:05.318 --> 03:09.914
##

03:35.081 --> 03:39.279
##

05:27.827 --> 05:29.124
Packing, dear?

05:30.430 --> 05:31.590
Yes, Mother.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.655
Mandy should
be here any minute.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.830
Is something wrong,
Mother?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.598
No, of course not.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.671
It's just that I'm gonna
miss you this weekend.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.971
I'm only going to
be gone for two nights.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.237
I know, but, Rebecca,

05:45.311 --> 05:48.769
you just got home
from school and...

05:48.848 --> 05:51.874
I really thought we'd spend
some quality time together.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.181
I'll be home
all next week.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.447
Well, come here a minute.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.012
I really
have to get going.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.027
Now, for your trip,
I got you some things

06:10.103 --> 06:12.333
that no young lady should
be without.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.134
Oh, Mother,
you shouldn't have.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.868
But I did!

06:15.942 --> 06:18.638
This isn't another
Tabernacle Chorus CD, is it?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.303
- Because I--
- Open it!

06:27.053 --> 06:28.145
Thanks.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.416
You may be away
from me this weekend,

06:30.490 --> 06:32.651
but God will always
be with you.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.759
It's for your vigils;

06:38.831 --> 06:41.391
plus to help you
read at night.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.697
I think the house we're
staying at has electricity.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.738
There's one more thing,
keep looking.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.201
Oh.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.607
Wow.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.269
I knew you'd like it.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.782
Well, it's definitely
something.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.147
Well, now that you have
all of your essentials,

06:59.218 --> 07:00.879
it's time to send you off
on your journey.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.215
Let us pray.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.348
May it be your will, God,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.723
that You lead us
toward peace,

07:07.794 --> 07:10.786
and make us reach
our desired destination

07:10.863 --> 07:13.889
in life, gladness and peace.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.457
( phone ringing )

07:16.536 --> 07:18.629
May You rescue us from...

07:18.704 --> 07:20.433
the hand of every foe,

07:20.506 --> 07:23.737
ambush, bandits and evil.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.835
Mom, I really got
to get this.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.047
- Yo, bitch.
- Hey, Mandy.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.416
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.681
- Can I--
- Well, your ass better be

07:35.755 --> 07:36.983
in the middle of
fucking packing.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.284
- I'll be there in ten.
- All right.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.722
- I'll see you when I get--
- Ooh.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.282
And Missy scored
the fake IDs,

07:41.360 --> 07:43.590
so we should look
nice and legal this weekend.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.756
All right,
really gotta run.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.198
Whatever.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.462
- May we continue?
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.406 --> 07:57.638
Dear Lord, may thy word be
a lamp unto our feet

07:57.710 --> 08:01.043
and a light
unto our path.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.239
Amen.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.409
Mom, I've really
gotta go.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.543
I know.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.282
And yet again, the most
disgusting company

08:12.358 --> 08:15.555
in the country,
Crazy Girls Unlimited,

08:15.628 --> 08:17.994
are throwing their
annual orgy

08:18.064 --> 08:20.498
in Daytona Beach, Florida.

08:20.566 --> 08:24.093
Every year, we here at HBN
try to protect our youth

08:24.170 --> 08:26.661
from this
collection of perverts,

08:26.739 --> 08:29.503
and every year, the response
is the same.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.638
Just take a look
at their past behavior!

08:34.714 --> 08:37.409
You can become an HBN angel

08:37.482 --> 08:40.645
by showing
your support here today.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.813
What kind of angel
are you?

08:42.889 --> 08:44.447
I'm a nasty angel.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.584
Your souls are
in danger.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.287
These girls holes...

08:49.362 --> 08:51.227
Now that's what's in danger!

08:51.297 --> 08:54.755
And Moses, with the tablet in
his mighty hand,

08:54.834 --> 08:57.132
approached
the mountain and said--

08:57.203 --> 08:59.068
Show me your tits!

08:59.138 --> 09:02.767
We came across this,
obviously, pirated footage

09:02.842 --> 09:05.310
from the Crazy Girls website

09:05.378 --> 09:07.209
on the Internet.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.771
And, to make
matters worse,

09:09.849 --> 09:13.376
Daytona will become this year's
Gomorrah when pornographer

09:13.452 --> 09:17.149
Ronald Jeremy becomes
the master of ceremonies,

09:17.223 --> 09:22.786
and Nicko McBrain will play his
hard rock music.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.386
Big surprise.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.660
When questioned, here is what
their local sheriff

09:27.733 --> 09:29.826
had to say...

09:29.902 --> 09:32.496
Well, Holly, I've spoken
with Mr. Governor at length

09:32.572 --> 09:34.472
and we've come to
an understanding.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.474
As long as they
follow the rules,

09:36.542 --> 09:37.975
I don't anticipate
any problems.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.777
Such filth.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.445
##

09:47.520 --> 09:48.919
Oh, Mandy's here.

09:50.957 --> 09:54.825
##

09:54.894 --> 09:56.122
Oh.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.459
Becky!

09:58.531 --> 10:00.931
Long time no see!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.524
You look great!

10:02.602 --> 10:03.899
Thanks, Todd.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.029
- Why are you--
- Hello, Mrs. Foster.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.868
You look younger
every time I see you.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.067
You sure the two
of you aren't sisters?

10:12.144 --> 10:14.203
Oh, Todd,
you're too much.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.271
And I told you a million
times, it's Rosemarie.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.277
So what brings you
here on this glorious day?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.653
Well, when a little birdie
told me that Becky here

10:24.724 --> 10:25.986
would be in town,

10:26.058 --> 10:27.685
I went straight out
and got us...

10:29.962 --> 10:30.929
... two tickets to see

10:30.997 --> 10:32.555
"The Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat"

10:32.632 --> 10:34.099
at the Surfside Amphitheater.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.191
Um, I can't,
you see, I--

10:36.268 --> 10:38.259
But Willie Aames
is touring with them.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.703
Rebecca, it sounds like such
a wonderful time!

10:40.773 --> 10:43.606
Then why don't
you go with him... sis?

10:43.676 --> 10:45.473
Rebecca,
don't be ridiculous.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.476
Come on, bitch!

10:46.545 --> 10:48.342
- Oh, sorry, Todd.
- Bec-- Becky--

10:48.414 --> 10:49.472
I got plans
this weekend.

10:49.548 --> 10:50.606
- Gotta run!
- Rebecca!

10:50.683 --> 10:51.911
Bye, Mom!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.417
Well, be safe
this weekend!

10:53.486 --> 10:55.954
Please don't do anything that
I wouldn't approve of!

10:58.124 --> 10:59.455
Just drive.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.790
##

11:09.101 --> 11:12.662
##

11:15.441 --> 11:17.773
What's up your ass?

11:17.843 --> 11:21.438
My mom strikes again
with the "Almighty Todd."

11:22.648 --> 11:24.741
Yeah, I saw that creep
in your driveway.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.614
Seriously, when is
she gonna stop with

11:26.686 --> 11:28.176
that arranged marriage
bullshit?

11:28.254 --> 11:29.482
I know.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.455
She's been trying to set us
up since we were, like, five.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.523
Uh...

11:33.592 --> 11:35.583
Ooh, ooh, I know.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.221
If it works out,
can I come to the wedding?

11:38.297 --> 11:40.197
Please?

11:40.266 --> 11:43.133
I already have the perfect
gift picked out for you.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.762
A key to your
chastity belt.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.338
Hey, hey, hey,
pull over, pull over!

11:49.408 --> 11:51.035
What, you want to
register there?

11:51.110 --> 11:52.805
Shut up and pull over.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.403
Fine... Mrs. Todd.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.346
Eww.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.432
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.240
Unleaded?

12:28.314 --> 12:31.147
Yeah, that would
be great.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.515
- 20 bucks worth.
- 20 buckos.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.420
Hey, what's up?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.516
Yes, I retrieved
the Virgin Mary.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.721
No, her mom's not with her.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.822
God, you're such
a bitch!

12:46.899 --> 12:48.389
So how's the house?

12:48.467 --> 12:50.628
Does it suck or...

12:50.703 --> 12:52.830
Oh, really, so what?

12:55.074 --> 12:56.234
Oh, my God.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.866
No, I don't carry
that shit on me

12:57.943 --> 13:00.810
and don't ask me that
on the fucking phone!

13:00.880 --> 13:02.643
God!

13:02.715 --> 13:05.149
So where
are we going now?

13:05.217 --> 13:08.209
Oh, that's right,
Manatee Creek.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.481
Mm-hmm.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.216
We'll see you in 30.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.090
Manatee Creek?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.519
Yeah?

13:17.596 --> 13:20.360
You sure you want to be
going over there?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.423
Yeah, why?

13:22.501 --> 13:25.629
Don't really think you
belong in a place like that.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.968
I'll keep that
in mind.

13:34.713 --> 13:39.377
##

13:39.451 --> 13:41.544
Holy shit!

13:44.924 --> 13:46.755
- Ready?
- Yeah.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.228
This is going to be
one hell of a weekend!

13:51.297 --> 13:54.562
##

13:55.768 --> 13:56.894
Peace.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.766
Hey, what about
my 20 bucks?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.533
Hey, come back,
you bitches!

14:00.606 --> 14:02.801
Hey!

14:02.875 --> 14:04.365
Son of a bitch!

14:05.644 --> 14:09.273
So did Missy actually get
permission to use this house

14:09.348 --> 14:10.872
or is this another one
of her schemes

14:10.950 --> 14:13.111
that involves us
climbing through a window?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.176
Would you relax for once?

14:15.254 --> 14:17.814
We're staying at a kick-ass
house on the beach,

14:17.890 --> 14:19.755
unchaperoned.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.793
Great, unchaperoned.

14:25.064 --> 14:29.364
##

14:30.569 --> 14:32.503
- Go, Hammerheads!
- Go, Hammerheads!

14:32.571 --> 14:34.596
Whoo!

14:34.673 --> 14:36.470
Oh, this is so pretty.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.373
Fuck, yeah,
ready to party?

14:38.444 --> 14:39.809
This place fucking rocks.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.946
Welcome to Casa De Beer.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.449
The party's inside,
bitches.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.451
- Follow me.
- Let's go inside...

14:48.954 --> 14:50.888
Asses up, bitches,
party time.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.083
Sluts are here!

14:55.027 --> 14:56.654
Hey!

15:02.201 --> 15:03.668
I'm so happy to
see you guys.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.761
Me too!

15:05.838 --> 15:07.396
I know,
it's been forever.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.707
I'll show you
to the kitchen.

15:12.778 --> 15:13.938
Fuck, yeah.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.412
Yeah!

15:17.483 --> 15:19.678
Even the kitchen
in this place is huge.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.119
We could cook for, like,
an army of men in here.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.455
I know.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.821
At least one day
while we're here,

15:26.892 --> 15:29.292
we should totally try to
make a real meal.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.092
No offense, Kel,
but we've all had your cooking

15:33.165 --> 15:36.430
and I'd like to be the first to
cast my vote as a no.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.594
Second.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.228
Anybody else remember that
cheerleading camp potluck?

15:39.305 --> 15:40.533
Oh, I remember that.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.301
What was that you made,
sweetie?

15:42.374 --> 15:44.239
Cheeseburger soufflé?

15:44.310 --> 15:46.505
Oh, what were
you thinking?

15:46.578 --> 15:47.943
Chocolate mousse
should not be layered

15:48.013 --> 15:49.310
- with ground beef.
- Right.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.212
I didn't mean to
make everybody sick,

15:51.283 --> 15:53.114
but the recipes,
they got mixed up.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.209
Blech!

15:56.355 --> 15:58.380
God, Missy, I'm hurt.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.186
I've known you for
how many years

16:00.259 --> 16:01.954
and yet I've never
been here before.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.221
Neither have I,
dumb-ass.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.387
Dad usually rents it.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.691
It just happened to be
empty this weekend,

16:05.764 --> 16:07.391
so he offered it to me.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.455
Fuck, yeah.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.002
I mean, this place
is amazing and everything,

16:11.070 --> 16:14.130
but does anybody wonder why
our town's former sheriff

16:14.206 --> 16:17.004
would have us stay here,
at party central?

16:17.076 --> 16:18.543
Who cares?

16:18.610 --> 16:19.542
Party...

16:21.447 --> 16:23.210
It's her mother.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.442
Hello, Mother.

16:24.516 --> 16:25.881
I'm amazed it
took this long.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.283
Yes, everything is fine.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.548
What?

16:29.621 --> 16:32.590
No, I already told you, boys
aren't staying at the house.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.682
"Mommie Dearest."

16:33.759 --> 16:37.251
I'll use them tonight,
I promise.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.092
No, I haven't
tried it on yet,

16:39.164 --> 16:40.791
but I'm sure
it fits fine.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.859
Mom, I really have to go.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.838
I'll call you on Sunday
when we're on our way home.

16:47.906 --> 16:49.271
Love you, too, Mom.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.138
Bye.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.438
What is that?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.274
- Drop it in.
- What?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.007
You heard me.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.548
I'm not giving
you my phone.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.379
It's not just you,
Becky-- everyone.

16:59.451 --> 17:00.509
Come on,
hand them over.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.712
Hell, no.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.345
Missy and I decided
that this weekend

17:03.422 --> 17:04.445
there'd be
no interruptions.

17:04.522 --> 17:05.751
Mm-hmm.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.553
No parents,
no boyfriends.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.857
And in Missy's case,
no booty calls.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.227
Uh, what happens if there's,
like, an emergency?

17:13.298 --> 17:15.232
Like Kelly
sets her hair on fire?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.232
Hey!

17:16.300 --> 17:19.236
We'll just have to dunk
her in the pool.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.862
Isn't there a landline?

17:20.939 --> 17:22.406
My dad shut
that off a year ago.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.839
Ever since some fucking
French assholes

17:23.909 --> 17:26.002
rang up the bill
calling Canada.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.046
France isn't in Canada.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.807
- Huh?
- Well?

17:31.884 --> 17:32.873
We'll use my phone.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.942
It will be for emergencies
and deliveries only.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.146
Well, I'm in.

17:37.756 --> 17:38.916
Rebecca?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.087
Fine.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.027
Seriously?

17:45.097 --> 17:46.029
Good girl.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.191
Do it.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.461
Whatever.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.701
Anything happens to that, and
you're buying me a new one.

17:54.773 --> 17:55.933
Don't be such a bitch.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.635
I'm putting them
in a safe place.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.939
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go upstairs,

18:00.012 --> 18:01.980
put on my new bikini
and go for a swim.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.914
- Who's with me?
- Fuck yeah!

18:04.983 --> 18:06.610
Girls, I'll show you
to your rooms.

18:06.685 --> 18:07.617
Grab our shit.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.783
##

18:14.026 --> 18:15.254
Cannonball!

18:19.631 --> 18:21.531
Whoo!

18:42.454 --> 18:43.785
Whoo!

18:45.090 --> 18:48.116
If you wanted to see them that
bad all you had to do was ask.

18:48.193 --> 18:49.785
Hell, who hasn't
seen them?

18:52.064 --> 18:53.258
Watch it.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.660
Look, I got one!

19:01.073 --> 19:02.904
- Kelly!
- Oh, my God.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.567
##

19:06.078 --> 19:07.568
Uh, guys?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.012
I think we
may have company.

19:10.082 --> 19:13.540
Oh, sweetie, lack of sex will
do that to you.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.053
- Do what?
- Screw with your head.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.022
Baby, you're starting to see
guys hiding in bushes.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.752
But don't worry,

19:20.826 --> 19:22.851
the girls and I will
take care of that tonight.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.327
That's right!

19:24.396 --> 19:26.523
Yeah, Becky,
we'll help you out.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.532
Are we still going to that
bar you told me about?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.295
Wy Uh-huh. 's!

19:30.369 --> 19:32.735
Daddy says it's crazy
this time of year.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.934
He actually compared it
to Mardi Gras on crack.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.136
So I say we go.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.678
Fuck yeah, I'm in!

19:40.746 --> 19:42.043
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.344
Mardi Gras, I'll go!

19:44.416 --> 19:45.849
We need one more.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.818
Well?

19:47.886 --> 19:49.148
Come on, come on.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.518
What are we waiting for?

19:50.589 --> 19:54.218
##

19:55.627 --> 19:58.027
Go, Hammerheads!

20:04.803 --> 20:05.963
Oh, fuck!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.232
God!

20:07.306 --> 20:09.570
Learn to drive much?

20:12.377 --> 20:14.675
Mud?

20:14.746 --> 20:16.941
Why am I in mud?

20:21.186 --> 20:22.710
It is mud, right?

20:22.788 --> 20:24.688
I hope that's mud.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.954
Where the fuck are we?

20:32.030 --> 20:33.691
This is Wyld Wylee's?

20:35.601 --> 20:36.829
Who knew I'd need
a Malaria shot

20:36.902 --> 20:38.199
to come out tonight?

20:38.270 --> 20:40.568
Look, I say we still go in
and check it out.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.106
What have
we got to lose?

20:42.174 --> 20:44.142
Our lives, wallets.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.301
Ladies?

20:45.377 --> 20:46.969
Everyone have their IDs
with them?

20:47.045 --> 20:47.977
Uh-huh.

20:48.046 --> 20:48.978
Good.

20:49.047 --> 20:49.979
Now follow me.

20:57.489 --> 20:58.888
Nice asses!

21:05.497 --> 21:09.831
Welcome to Wyld Wylee's Oasis.

21:09.901 --> 21:13.268
I'll be your tour guide
for tonight.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.101
Could I get you girls

21:15.173 --> 21:18.631
some of our
famous monkey margaritas?

21:18.710 --> 21:19.904
Um, yeah, hi.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.446
There's not another Wyld Wylee's
around here, is there?

21:22.514 --> 21:26.382
Nope, this is
the one and only.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.079
World famous!

21:34.893 --> 21:37.088
Is there a mortician's
convention in town?

21:37.162 --> 21:40.063
Because this
place... is dead.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.656
Cute.

21:43.201 --> 21:44.998
How old are you,
Sheila?

21:45.070 --> 21:46.162
I'm 26.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.203
Says here you're
born in 1968.

21:56.281 --> 21:59.546
Um, the guy at
the DMV was dyslexic.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.549
Oh, crikey!

22:04.623 --> 22:06.887
No worries, no worries.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.983
Come on, girls,
don't be shy.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.551
Take a table

22:10.629 --> 22:14.190
and I'm going to
bring you some Congo Coladas.

22:15.634 --> 22:16.726
Come on.

22:21.373 --> 22:24.467
There is something really
wrong with this place.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.238
I like it.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.336
It makes me think of,
like, an Irish pub.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.879
What else can I get you?

22:32.951 --> 22:35.283
Um...

22:35.354 --> 22:37.549
I guess we'll
take some nachos.

22:37.622 --> 22:42.650
Would that be small, medium,
or gorilla-sized?

22:42.728 --> 22:45.856
Um, gorilla-sized,
I guess.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.731
Oh, nice choice,
mate, nice choice.

22:53.205 --> 22:57.642
##

23:11.423 --> 23:12.754
One more round!

23:12.824 --> 23:13.984
Okay?

23:21.133 --> 23:23.067
Two rounds, two rounds!

23:34.179 --> 23:37.706
Becky, Becky, Becky,
Becky, Becky...

23:47.559 --> 23:49.993
Oh, my God, watch out for
the fucking gorilla!

23:50.061 --> 23:52.495
What are you
supposed to be?

23:54.666 --> 23:58.329
I'm just a helpful primate
bringing you your order.

23:58.403 --> 24:01.304
Well, Dr. Zaius,
you forgot the plates.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.000
I'll get right
on that, ma'am.

24:03.074 --> 24:04.871
Let me swing on over
to the kitchen.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.808
- You do that.
- Whatever.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.607
Something
is very wrong here.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.079
I know what you mean.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.979
That Sasquatch
could talk.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.280
Not what I was
going for, Kel...

24:14.352 --> 24:15.512
but thank you.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.851
No, I'm referring
to the fact that

24:17.923 --> 24:21.825
this place is
called an oasis,

24:21.893 --> 24:24.862
but our bartender is dressed
like Panama Jack,

24:24.930 --> 24:27.660
and this whole place
has a Hawaiian theme,

24:27.732 --> 24:30.826
yet a gorilla just served
us nachos.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.132
Sasquatch.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.404
What?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.910
Thank you.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.112
I didn't order this.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.308
I know you didn't.

24:45.383 --> 24:47.613
He did... for you.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.692
Is he cute?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.955
I can't tell,
I'm seeing two of him.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.327
That's one of him.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.958
On two stools.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.831
You guys are so mean.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.871
I bet he's
a really nice guy.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.406
Well, I am going to
go find out.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.476
- If she were--
- Oh!

25:17.282 --> 25:21.082
If she were at the drive-in,
he'd be the double feature.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.744
Oh, I need a shot.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.254
Here.

25:24.322 --> 25:25.721
Cheers.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.557
Oh...

25:30.962 --> 25:32.486
Oh, why are you so green?

25:32.564 --> 25:35.089
Oh, I don't
feel so good.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.498
I'm going to go to
the bathroom.

25:37.569 --> 25:38.501
I know what will
make you feel better.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.696
I'll get you
another shot.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.203
Speaking of shots...

25:43.642 --> 25:45.007
- Oh, my God.
- What?

25:45.076 --> 25:46.566
You know Becky's
a lightweight.

25:46.645 --> 25:47.577
No.

25:50.415 --> 25:51.939
That.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.746
Eww!

25:53.818 --> 25:56.286
It's like a car accident.

25:56.354 --> 25:59.551
I know I should
look away, but I can't.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.919
Eww...

26:01.993 --> 26:03.483
How much you want to bet
that she does it with

26:03.562 --> 26:05.393
"tons of fun" over there?

26:05.463 --> 26:07.488
I'm in,
I'm fucking in.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.431
That sounds like
a carnival ride.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.061
Uh, he looks
like a carnival ride.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.128
Hey, cool it, cool it, they're
coming back to the table.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.538
Hey, where's Becky?

26:17.609 --> 26:19.941
I wanted to say
good night.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.036
Go Yeah. t?

26:22.113 --> 26:24.707
Jare-- Sorry.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.717
This is Jared.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.015
We are gonna go
for a little drive.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.349
Mm-hmm.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.684
Don't wait up.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.155
Mm-mmm.

26:33.224 --> 26:36.159
Lisa, can I talk
to you for a minute?

26:38.563 --> 26:40.292
No!

26:40.365 --> 26:43.061
We've gotta get going.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.433
Well, how long should
we wait for you two?

26:46.504 --> 26:51.464
Um, he says he's going to take me back to
the house.

26:51.543 --> 26:52.703
I am.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.836
In the morning.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.540
Let's roll!

26:58.016 --> 26:59.779
- Bye.
- Did that just happen?

26:59.851 --> 27:02.251
Are we just gonna let her run
off with some random dude?

27:02.320 --> 27:05.016
She'll be fine,
he seemed really nice.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.388
I mean, he did buy
her a drink.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.019
I'm sure Ted Bundy bought
a few drinks back in his day.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.426
Didn't make him
a good date.

27:13.665 --> 27:16.429
Up next is Wylee singing
"Forever Wasted. "

27:16.501 --> 27:18.901
Come on, handsome.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.495
I can't wait to see
what you're packing.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.734
Ahh!!

27:23.808 --> 27:26.834
How about
we go to your place?

27:26.911 --> 27:30.074
I don't know how my landlords
are going to feel about that.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.479
What?

27:31.549 --> 27:33.881
You live with
your landlords?

27:33.952 --> 27:35.385
I kind of, sort of...

27:35.453 --> 27:37.011
Iive with my parents.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.581
Is there
any place we can go?

27:43.361 --> 27:44.453
I got an idea.

27:44.529 --> 27:46.497
Come on, come on!

27:46.564 --> 27:48.191
- What are we waiting for, then? - Hurry up!

27:48.266 --> 27:50.063
Go, go, go!

27:57.342 --> 28:01.802
# Forever wasted by you #

28:03.415 --> 28:06.179
# Every time
you call my name #

28:06.251 --> 28:09.448
# It's music to my ears #

28:09.521 --> 28:14.618
# But I'll admit sometimes
I run away in fear... #

28:14.693 --> 28:16.558
Oh...

28:16.628 --> 28:20.655
#... my word's sincere #

28:20.732 --> 28:24.759
# I'm so
wasted by you #

28:29.774 --> 28:35.076
# Forever wasted by you ##

28:46.324 --> 28:47.450
Fuck my life.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.121
Ooga, ooga, ooga.

28:52.197 --> 28:55.598
Please welcome
Ronald singing "Hammersmash."

29:01.706 --> 29:04.266
- Hammersmash!
- Whoo!

29:06.478 --> 29:07.467
Hi.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.410
You so have
a crush on him.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.111
He's my friend.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.418
Damn this.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.617
Can't get this
thing off.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.626
# Hammersmash #

29:27.699 --> 29:28.791
Oh, my God, girls.

29:28.867 --> 29:29.993
Do you remember
this song?

29:30.068 --> 29:31.000
Hell, yeah.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.969
Junior year, baby.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.834
# This is DC Hammer #

29:34.906 --> 29:36.339
# And I'm so good #

29:36.407 --> 29:37.635
# I think of all the rhymes that
you wish you could #

29:37.709 --> 29:39.836
Up, come on,
you're dancing...

29:39.911 --> 29:41.469
Come on, Miss.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.411
# And I'll move you
out of your seat #

29:43.481 --> 29:45.039
# With the baseline
of my funky beat #

29:45.116 --> 29:46.947
# And I'll make
you shake your ass #

29:47.018 --> 29:49.111
# Because this here song's
a Hammersmash #

29:55.226 --> 29:56.158
Oh...

29:56.227 --> 29:57.660
A front-see!

29:57.729 --> 30:00.197
It's been a while since
I've seen one of those.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.158
# Man this shit's a hit #

30:04.235 --> 30:05.532
# Hammersmash #

30:05.603 --> 30:07.195
# Yeah let's
get down to it #

30:07.272 --> 30:08.671
# Every time you hear me #

30:08.740 --> 30:10.435
# You want to
dance around #

30:10.508 --> 30:14.376
# To my dope-ass record
and my fresh new sound... #

30:14.445 --> 30:15.673
Boys.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.510
# When I start spittin'
rhymes like this... #

30:17.582 --> 30:19.948
I told you,
it'd be right there.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.451
# Is a number-one hit #

30:21.519 --> 30:23.851
( man )
Dude, get this right here,
get this, film it.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.082
Right here, right here.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.351
Zack, are you
a fucking homo, dude?

30:27.425 --> 30:28.983
There's fucking hot chicks
right there, look.

30:29.060 --> 30:29.992
You want me
to shoot that?

30:30.061 --> 30:31.426
Look, Zack.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.088
I'll get the one in pink to
let you put it in her pooper.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.155
Dirk, but there's
none in pink.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.632
Exactly.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.293
I love this shit.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.098
# I don't know what
to say right here but #

30:40.171 --> 30:41.604
# Hammersmash #

30:57.088 --> 30:59.579
This is so much better
than D&D!

30:59.657 --> 31:00.954
# My shit don't stink #

31:01.025 --> 31:02.424
# Or maybe
sometime it do #

31:02.493 --> 31:05.985
# Everybody else's stinks but
Hammer's don't stink at all #

31:08.366 --> 31:10.391
I'll be back
in one second.

31:12.503 --> 31:13.561
I was going to tell you
take a picture

31:13.638 --> 31:14.764
'cause it'll last longer,

31:14.839 --> 31:17.569
but looks like you're
already doing that.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.133
You look like someone
who should be in the movies.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.940
Mm-hmm.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.140
Serious, you interested?

31:24.215 --> 31:26.547
Why don't you bring your people,
come meet my people,

31:26.618 --> 31:28.848
and maybe we can
reach an agreement.

31:36.861 --> 31:38.522
# Smack me, smack me #

31:38.596 --> 31:40.427
# Smack me
like a monkey ##

31:40.498 --> 31:42.557
Get ready, girls!

31:44.168 --> 31:46.636
Go...

31:46.704 --> 31:48.501
Hammerheads!

31:48.573 --> 31:50.234
Whoo!

31:50.308 --> 31:51.798
Give me Yeah. second.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.572
Ahh!

31:56.648 --> 32:00.846
Easy on the teeth,
Lisa!

32:00.919 --> 32:05.720
##

32:19.871 --> 32:22.135
##

32:22.206 --> 32:24.231
You guys can't be locals.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.640
Why is that?

32:28.579 --> 32:29.944
Call it a hunch.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.346
No, actually we're passing
through on our way to Daytona.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.714
Greg here wants to
be a cameraman

32:33.785 --> 32:36.049
for Crazy Girls Unlimited.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.052
Right there!

32:37.121 --> 32:38.418
Hey, this is Sal.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.389
Come party with me,
and my main man Beetlejuice

32:40.458 --> 32:44.258
this weekend at the Crazy Girls Mansion in
Daytona.

32:44.329 --> 32:45.728
Crazy girls!

32:45.797 --> 32:46.821
Whoo!

32:46.898 --> 32:47.922
It's gonna be wild.

32:47.999 --> 32:48.966
It's gonna be crazy.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.000
You're gonna love it.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.228
You're going to be
followed around

32:51.302 --> 32:53.862
by the one and only,
exclusive Beetle Cam!

32:53.938 --> 32:55.371
Beetle Cam!

32:55.440 --> 32:57.067
See it my way!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.166
You'll be having pillow fights
with the main man.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.677
The biggest schlong
in the world, Ron Jeremy.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.737
Well, I used to like
Crazy Girls Unlimited.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.409
Show up to this event
or drop dead.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.345
You guys know that Crazy Girls
is one of the fastest-growing

33:10.421 --> 33:13.083
Fortune 500 topless video
companies in the world, right?

33:13.157 --> 33:15.091
You're the only one
that knows that.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.490
Why would I know that?

33:16.561 --> 33:18.756
All you are is one of them
damn camera pervs, man.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.457
That's right,
you handsome bastard.

33:20.531 --> 33:21.930
I'm going to be
a famous one soon.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.365
( Missy )
Oh, good for you.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.698
We should try out.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.169
- You want to audition?
- Yes.

33:27.238 --> 33:28.705
Okay, what should I sing?

33:28.773 --> 33:32.209
Kelly, Crazy Girls Unlimited
is not a talent contest.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.073
We just saw
the commercial.

33:34.145 --> 33:35.544
It's a "who can get drunk

33:35.613 --> 33:38.047
and take their top off
the fastest" show.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.107
That takes talent.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.277
I can do that, too.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.786
Awesome.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.482
Rolling.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.786
I don't think so.

33:49.727 --> 33:51.695
Hey, could you guys
excuse me for a second?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.025
I need to go check
on our friend.

33:53.097 --> 33:54.655
Oh, there's another one?

33:54.732 --> 33:55.892
Uh-huh.

33:55.967 --> 33:58.026
Actually, there's two of us
missing right now.

33:58.102 --> 33:59.729
Sweet.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.999
- The more the merrier.
- Hell, yeah.

34:02.073 --> 34:04.564
Let's get some more of them
"tig" ol' "bitties" up in here.

34:06.511 --> 34:09.241
Is your friend here
retarded?

34:09.313 --> 34:10.940
Which one?

34:11.014 --> 34:12.447
Probably.

34:12.516 --> 34:15.418
He's from Belle Glade or some
other fucking redneck town.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.918
I ain't from
no Belle Glade, fuck.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.580
I'm from Pahokee,
man, shit.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.317
Oh, oh, oh.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.655
That is right
on Lake Okeechobee.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.422
The birthplace of
Mel Tillis.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.259
Who the fuck is Mel Tillis?

34:27.331 --> 34:30.300
I am geography major.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.630
I like rocks.

34:31.702 --> 34:35.138
Especially the shiny ones.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.369
Kelly, I think
you're confused.

34:38.443 --> 34:41.435
Geo-graphists don't
study rocks.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.070
Geologists do.

34:43.147 --> 34:45.411
Yeah, Kelly,
geo-graphists do.

34:45.483 --> 34:47.678
Uh-oh.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.617
So what brought
you guys here?

34:49.687 --> 34:53.453
Was it the, uh,
karaoke or fine wines?

34:53.524 --> 34:56.322
Greg here runs a video blog
and this month's topic

34:56.393 --> 34:58.919
is "Roadside bars and the
patrons who love them."

34:58.996 --> 35:00.122
Mm-hmm.

35:00.198 --> 35:01.790
Interesting.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.767
Look who I found
in the toilet!

35:04.836 --> 35:06.565
Can we go home now?

35:08.039 --> 35:10.234
Open wide, sweetie.

35:10.308 --> 35:11.570
In a sec, Becky.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.337
Come on, meet our
new friends here.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.040
This is Eric, Zack, Bob.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.140
My friends call me, Bo.

35:19.217 --> 35:21.378
Hello, Bob or Bo.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.580
Finishing off the group is,
uh, Greg on camera,

35:24.655 --> 35:27.624
and, uh... Dirk.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.751
Charmed.

35:29.827 --> 35:31.351
Do you need any help
getting her to the car?

35:31.429 --> 35:33.522
Oh, my God,
that would be great.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.192
- She's getting really heavy.
- Yes, oh, wow.

35:36.267 --> 35:37.495
Do you get
a merit badge for that?

35:37.568 --> 35:40.059
Okay, Missy,
playtime is over.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.698
In a sec... I gotta get
some numbers.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.970
I thought you confiscated
all of our phones?

35:46.043 --> 35:48.705
Well, at least
I got rid of one of them.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.077
You're such a bitch!

35:51.149 --> 35:52.616
Come on, Kelly.

35:54.519 --> 35:57.215
Say tomorrow, around 4:00.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.721
Definitely.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.120
We actually have to
go to Daytona.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.716
Dude...

36:02.793 --> 36:06.661
Tomorrow and we'll
all give you...

36:06.731 --> 36:08.028
something to film.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.794
You guys, Crazy Girls
happens all weekend,

36:09.867 --> 36:11.926
so we'll just get a room
down at the motel?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.027
Yep.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.628
Yeah, we'll see you there.

36:14.705 --> 36:16.036
See you, boys...

36:16.107 --> 36:17.665
tomorrow.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.471
Yeah, you will.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.540
All right,
let's get you in here.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.109
Stay, stay, stay.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.587
You're cute.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.919
Do I smell like vomit?

36:32.990 --> 36:34.389
Ew.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.790
Thanks for
all your help.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.329
So I guess I'll see
you around.

36:39.397 --> 36:40.762
Count on it.

36:45.102 --> 36:46.763
Hey.

36:46.837 --> 36:50.000
So what about Lisa?

36:50.074 --> 36:51.666
Should we call her?

36:51.742 --> 36:54.370
She'll be fine,
she's a big girl.

36:54.445 --> 36:58.074
Besides, we don't want to
interrupt anything.

37:00.518 --> 37:01.485
All right, see you guys.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.042
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.781
Have a good night.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.322
Bye.

37:06.390 --> 37:10.156
##

37:42.526 --> 37:46.519
##

37:53.271 --> 37:55.205
Hello, and welcome to
another episode of

37:55.273 --> 37:57.036
"Fairways And Greens."

37:57.108 --> 37:59.975
My name is Montgomery Keybutter,

38:00.044 --> 38:02.308
though everybody on
the tour called me "Monk."

38:05.216 --> 38:08.151
Instructing professional
golfers is quite different

38:08.219 --> 38:10.414
than pulling
the average man...

38:13.557 --> 38:14.888
Pendulum stroke.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.492
Watch the ball to the hole.

38:19.563 --> 38:20.962
It's that simple.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.796
And we will be joining Paul on
the green right after this.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.874
Crazy Girls Unlimited,

38:30.941 --> 38:32.033
the company that brought you

38:32.109 --> 38:33.406
"Ho, Ho, Ho's Christmas
Dreams"...

38:33.477 --> 38:35.035
Merry Christmas!

38:35.112 --> 38:36.044
Ha-ha-ha!

38:36.113 --> 38:37.205
I've got a boner.

38:37.281 --> 38:40.409
And "Irish Lasses
with the Hottest Asses."

38:40.484 --> 38:42.008
Top o' the morning to you!

38:42.086 --> 38:43.747
Happy St. Patrick's Day!

38:43.821 --> 38:48.087
Invites you to be the star
of our latest video...

38:48.159 --> 38:49.217
Mandy!

38:49.293 --> 38:50.920
... with the annual Spring Break Or Bust
blowout...

38:50.995 --> 38:53.225
at our Mansion in
Daytona Beach, Florida.

38:53.297 --> 38:54.628
The party begins at noon today

38:54.699 --> 38:57.827
with our celebrity emcee,
Ron Jeremy!

38:57.902 --> 38:59.301
Plus, at 7:00 p.m.,

38:59.370 --> 39:02.737
there will be a special
performance by Nicko McBrain,

39:02.807 --> 39:06.174
singing hits from his
debut country album.

39:06.243 --> 39:07.642
Yeah!

39:07.712 --> 39:11.307
Beetlejuice will be on hand
with the infamous Beetle Cam.

39:11.382 --> 39:12.576
- Beetle Cam!
- Okay, I'm up.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.448
- Please, turn it off.
- Fine.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.781
As always, if you're
crazy enough...

39:18.122 --> 39:19.282
Well, good, now get up
and get ready.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.621
We're going to
the beach in 20!

39:24.762 --> 39:25.990
Okay.

39:26.063 --> 39:28.122
- The beach?
- Mm-hmm.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.689
Swimming.

39:29.767 --> 39:33.203
Hey, Mandy, did, uh,
Lisa get back yet?

39:33.270 --> 39:35.795
Uh, no, not yet.

39:35.873 --> 39:40.207
And I think I know why.

39:40.277 --> 39:41.505
Someone called her
and warned her

39:41.579 --> 39:44.047
that Kelly
was making breakfast, blech.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.412
- Funny.
- Mmmm.

39:46.984 --> 39:48.144
Now get up

39:48.219 --> 39:49.652
or else I'm going to
have Kelly come up here

39:49.720 --> 39:51.085
with the plate
she saved you.

39:51.155 --> 39:53.851
Ummm...

39:53.924 --> 39:55.357
Let's go!

39:55.426 --> 39:57.587
##

39:59.163 --> 40:00.323
Whoo!

40:02.133 --> 40:04.067
Whoo!

40:15.579 --> 40:17.410
Don't forget the booze!

40:18.716 --> 40:20.115
Let's go, hurry up.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.652
I hope there's really cute
guys at this beach.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.688
Yahoo!

40:24.755 --> 40:27.519
##

40:30.461 --> 40:32.520
Here we come!

40:32.596 --> 40:35.759
So much fun!

40:35.833 --> 40:37.095
Just like high school!

40:37.168 --> 40:40.069
Whoo!

40:40.137 --> 40:41.627
Oh...

40:41.705 --> 40:43.036
##

40:44.642 --> 40:47.406
Okay, Missy,
what the fuck?

40:47.478 --> 40:49.912
We put up with this shit bar,
but this?

40:49.980 --> 40:51.538
This completely blows.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.675
I thought we were going to
a beach, not a cemetery.

40:54.752 --> 40:56.811
This fucking place is
where people come to die!

40:56.887 --> 40:58.684
What, who died?

40:58.756 --> 40:59.882
I just don't get it.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.152
Dad said this was
supposed to be a hip town,

41:02.226 --> 41:05.059
not a hip-replacement town.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.689
What... the hell?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.401
Phone.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.233
You'll fit right in,
Grandma.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.000
Oh, my God.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.439
- She's calling Lisa.
- Who cares?

41:18.509 --> 41:19.874
- I don't.
- Hey, Lisa.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.138
It's Jessie again.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.975
Um, we're at the beach,
and...

41:23.047 --> 41:25.709
Are we going to stay or...

41:29.820 --> 41:33.221
##

41:35.726 --> 41:37.591
Well, that explains it.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.720
- What?
- That.

41:42.199 --> 41:44.599
Fuck me!

41:44.668 --> 41:46.465
Not likely
in this town.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.066
Now what?

42:01.185 --> 42:02.447
Oh, great.

42:03.587 --> 42:04.781
Hmm...

42:09.960 --> 42:12.588
- Hello, Melissa.
- Hello, Darren.

42:12.663 --> 42:15.359
Gee, Deputy,
what did I do wrong?

42:15.432 --> 42:18.230
Well, for starters,
going 65 in a 40.

42:18.302 --> 42:19.599
What are you gonna do?

42:19.670 --> 42:21.103
- Arrest me?
- Missy?

42:21.171 --> 42:22.468
What are you doing?
Shut up.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.529
Oh, don't worry.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.666
Deputy Dickhead here
can't touch us.

42:27.811 --> 42:30.041
Or at least not anymore.

42:30.114 --> 42:31.877
Melissa, that
was a long time ago.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.940
I thought we settled that.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.815
Hello, everybody,
this is Ron Jeremy

42:35.886 --> 42:38.582
and I'm calling all hot ladies
in the Space Coast area

42:38.656 --> 42:40.055
- to Crazy Girls Unlimited...
- Oh!

42:40.124 --> 42:41.648
- Is that where you're going? - Where?

42:41.725 --> 42:44.250
Daytona, to strip for
the cameras.

42:44.328 --> 42:46.558
Who I strip for and why
is none of your damn business.

42:46.630 --> 42:47.654
So either give me a ticket

42:47.731 --> 42:49.824
or let us get
the fuck out of here.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.835
How many people do you got
staying at your dad's house?

42:52.903 --> 42:55.269
- Excuse me?
- Aren't you missing someone?

42:55.339 --> 42:56.966
Well, yeah, actually,
our friend--

42:58.042 --> 43:00.943
How would you know how many
people I have with me?

43:01.011 --> 43:03.980
- So you are missing someone?
- Sort of.

43:04.048 --> 43:05.948
Our friend, Lisa, left the bar
last night with this fat kid

43:06.016 --> 43:09.281
and she
hasn't come back yet.

43:09.353 --> 43:10.320
I keep calling her phone, but now it's going

43:10.387 --> 43:11.752
straight to voice-mail.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.050
- Interesting.
- What?

43:13.123 --> 43:14.488
She pulls this
shit all the time.

43:14.558 --> 43:15.752
Last night when I was at
Wylee's, I thought that I--

43:15.826 --> 43:17.225
Last night at Wylee's?

43:17.294 --> 43:19.023
Are you spying
on me again?

43:21.999 --> 43:23.796
Do restraining orders
mean nothing to you?

43:23.867 --> 43:25.892
Look, I was just
trying to make sure--

43:25.970 --> 43:27.631
I'm not sure what you're
trying to make sure of.

43:27.705 --> 43:29.639
We're fine, Lisa's fine,
she'll come back.

43:29.707 --> 43:30.765
- Don't worry about us.
- But-- but--

43:30.841 --> 43:32.604
I said everything
will be fine, Darren.

43:32.676 --> 43:34.405
Can I go now?

43:34.478 --> 43:35.570
Bye.

43:38.415 --> 43:40.110
Uh, are you going to
explain that one?

43:40.184 --> 43:41.879
Yeah, who was that?

43:42.252 --> 43:43.514
A mistake.

43:44.955 --> 43:48.220
##

44:27.498 --> 44:28.931
Let's go, Beet, get in there.

44:28.999 --> 44:30.523
I want that helmet so deep
up that twat,

44:30.601 --> 44:31.625
you can see
their uterus.

44:31.702 --> 44:33.067
Let's go, come on.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.469
Dive in, Beet,
dive in, come on!

44:35.539 --> 44:36.767
There you go.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.432
You're the Jacques Cousteau
of pussy, let's go!

44:38.509 --> 44:41.103
##

44:41.178 --> 44:44.670
Craziest Girls Unlimited
go crazy!

44:46.250 --> 44:48.411
Any girl that can
roll like a carpet,

44:48.485 --> 44:49.850
ride like a Harley,

44:49.920 --> 44:51.751
flip like
a cheese omelet

44:51.822 --> 44:55.258
goes upstairs to Sal's
private quarters,

44:55.325 --> 44:58.021
and you get
shot by Beetle Cam!

44:58.095 --> 45:01.292
And you know that's a good
career move for any girl.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.593
Dance your asses off!

45:02.666 --> 45:04.156
Come on!

45:07.171 --> 45:08.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.102
Are your tits
on this list?

45:13.310 --> 45:15.403
Good, then make like
Michael and beat it.

45:15.479 --> 45:19.506
##

45:33.397 --> 45:35.262
You have a beautiful face.

45:35.332 --> 45:36.560
You should see my ass.

45:36.633 --> 45:40.399
##

45:43.107 --> 45:45.268
Whoa.

45:45.342 --> 45:47.037
Sorry, sweetheart,
no one's allowed upstairs.

45:47.111 --> 45:48.135
Check it again,
meathead.

45:48.212 --> 45:50.612
I'm on the A-list.

45:51.682 --> 45:52.614
What's your name?

45:52.683 --> 45:53.615
Destiny.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.549
I'm here for my close-up.

45:55.619 --> 45:56.745
Get them clothes off...

45:56.820 --> 45:58.685
Sal, you there, over?

45:58.756 --> 46:00.314
Yeah, it's Sal,
what's up?

46:00.390 --> 46:02.221
Sal, I got a girl down here
named Destiny.

46:02.292 --> 46:04.123
Oh, the one
with the little boy tits?

46:04.194 --> 46:05.593
Tits like a little boy?

46:07.231 --> 46:08.391
Yep, that'd be the one.

46:08.465 --> 46:10.194
- Send her up.
- All right.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.293
##

46:17.975 --> 46:18.907
Tony?

46:18.976 --> 46:20.000
Yeah, over here.

46:20.077 --> 46:23.274
Yeah, make sure you
get these, uh, fish buckets.

46:23.347 --> 46:24.279
Get the release for them.

46:24.348 --> 46:25.280
- You got it.
- Beet, come on.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.282
Come on, come on,
come on!

46:28.619 --> 46:30.712
Ah-ha, way to go, Beet!

46:30.788 --> 46:33.848
Let's get one of those
dumb twat's drunk tonight

46:33.924 --> 46:35.084
- and get you some pussy.
- Oh, yes!

46:35.159 --> 46:36.683
Tony, enough with the bullshit,
bring the meat holes in.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.022
This other idiot here.

46:38.095 --> 46:39.289
To the hot tub!

46:39.363 --> 46:41.058
Ye You're dead. d.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.895
Yeah, work on the ass.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.525
Beet, you got bigger tits
than this one.

46:45.602 --> 46:46.762
Keep moving please,
you're wasting--

46:46.837 --> 46:48.737
Ugh, no comment.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.639
Yeah, give yourself
a pap smear with that one.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.835
Here you go, hide your
crack pipe in it, sweetheart.

46:53.911 --> 46:55.173
Way to go.

46:55.245 --> 46:59.204
Put that over your face,
make everyone happy.

46:59.283 --> 47:02.514
- Dy-no-mite, there you go.
- Diamond rings!

47:02.586 --> 47:03.518
Camera time!

47:03.587 --> 47:04.952
Whoo!

47:05.022 --> 47:06.512
Woo-hoo!

47:06.590 --> 47:07.614
Very nice.

47:07.691 --> 47:08.953
Check out this
piece of ass, baby.

47:09.026 --> 47:10.425
Check out that
piece of parm.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.394
Yeah.

47:12.462 --> 47:13.486
It looked like somebody--

47:13.564 --> 47:14.792
Look at that,
Beet, hit it.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.196
Touch it, rub it.

47:16.266 --> 47:17.665
Get Rub it down... man.

47:17.734 --> 47:19.031
That a boy!

47:19.102 --> 47:20.034
Let me get
a whiff of that.

47:20.103 --> 47:21.331
Woo-wee!

47:21.405 --> 47:25.341
##

47:31.215 --> 47:32.239
Come on, get hot, baby.

47:32.316 --> 47:34.079
Give me the lines,
give me the lines.

47:34.151 --> 47:35.641
I love
Crazy Girls Unlimited.

47:35.719 --> 47:37.050
I'm barely 18.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.052
And you barely have
any tits.

47:38.121 --> 47:39.645
You're lucky you got a job.

47:39.723 --> 47:41.623
Beet, zoom in on that.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.057
I'm just a freshman.

47:43.126 --> 47:44.650
That's the only thing that's
fresh about you.

47:44.728 --> 47:45.990
Come on, baby.

47:46.063 --> 47:48.088
My dick's dying of cancer here,
looking at this garbage.

47:48.165 --> 47:49.132
Come on!

47:51.835 --> 47:56.101
##

48:23.433 --> 48:24.695
Yeah.

48:24.768 --> 48:25.757
Just a little bit more, come on,
let's see those piss flaps.

48:25.836 --> 48:27.497
Come on, put them forward.

48:27.571 --> 48:28.731
Come on,
baby, work it.

48:28.805 --> 48:31.137
You got to get me hot,
you got to get me stiff.

48:31.208 --> 48:33.267
Work it.

48:33.343 --> 48:34.469
All right, cut.

48:34.544 --> 48:36.944
Beet, put the camera down, that's enough of
this shit.

48:37.014 --> 48:38.948
That a boy.

48:40.017 --> 48:40.949
I said cut.

48:41.018 --> 48:42.007
Here, take your T-shirt.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.814
Go downstairs, suck a dick,
make yourself useful.

48:43.887 --> 48:45.582
I thought that was part of
the deal anyway.

48:45.656 --> 48:46.588
Shut up.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.421
Hold on, there's
somebody at the door.

48:49.493 --> 48:50.425
Hang out, Beet.

48:53.830 --> 48:55.127
What's up?
I'm busy.

48:57.801 --> 48:59.996
Jesus Christ!

49:00.070 --> 49:02.800
What the fuck?

49:02.873 --> 49:04.204
I'll see you later,
sweetheart.

49:04.274 --> 49:05.764
Beet, let's get
the hell out of here!

49:05.842 --> 49:07.139
What, huh?

49:11.448 --> 49:12.745
Save yourself, B!

49:12.816 --> 49:14.511
Don't worry about me,
man, don't worry about him!

49:14.584 --> 49:17.678
Jesus Christ, what the fuck's
going on in here?

49:21.758 --> 49:23.817
Get behind me, man,
get behind!

49:23.894 --> 49:25.862
So anything else
you want to do for me?

49:25.929 --> 49:26.861
Yeah.

49:26.930 --> 49:28.420
You and me later.

49:28.498 --> 49:29.965
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

49:30.033 --> 49:32.263
Please, Jesus...

49:32.336 --> 49:33.360
What about
a little head?

49:33.437 --> 49:34.734
God, stop, no!

49:34.805 --> 49:36.033
Fuck this!

49:47.050 --> 49:48.608
You motherfucker!

49:54.057 --> 49:55.490
See you later...

49:55.559 --> 49:56.821
shit head!

50:10.307 --> 50:14.903
##

50:15.979 --> 50:18.140
( phone ringing )

50:18.215 --> 50:19.807
Is that Lisa?

50:19.883 --> 50:21.350
I don't know, Einstein.

50:21.418 --> 50:22.851
I haven't
answered it yet.

50:22.919 --> 50:24.284
Well, if it's her, could you please ask her

50:24.354 --> 50:25.446
where our cell phones are?

50:25.522 --> 50:29.253
I haven't updated
my status in, like, two days.

50:29.326 --> 50:31.089
People are going to
think I'm dead.

50:33.563 --> 50:35.121
Oh, hi, Daddy.

50:35.198 --> 50:37.359
Just the person
I wanted to talk to.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.561
Hello, pumpkin.

50:39.636 --> 50:40.967
How's the house?

50:41.038 --> 50:42.096
The house is fine.

50:42.172 --> 50:43.469
How's Vegas?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.098
It's just another
real-estate convention,

50:45.175 --> 50:46.665
but it's going well.

50:46.743 --> 50:47.835
So you girls
having fun?

50:47.911 --> 50:49.310
Oh, did you
go to Wylee's?

50:49.379 --> 50:50.311
Sure, did.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.642
Even met Wylee herself.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.114
Really?

50:53.183 --> 50:55.981
I'll take it you're taking in
the local culture.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.714
That depends, Daddy.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.847
Do you consider culture to be
shuffleboard tournaments

50:59.923 --> 51:01.914
and early bird specials?

51:01.992 --> 51:04.085
Because that's
what's going on here.

51:04.161 --> 51:05.924
I mean, come on.

51:05.996 --> 51:07.896
A retirement community?

51:07.964 --> 51:10.524
What, are you
punishing me?

51:10.600 --> 51:12.067
Of course not, pumpkin.

51:12.135 --> 51:13.966
I bought that place
for peace and quiet.

51:14.037 --> 51:15.902
I figured that's
what you girls wanted, too.

51:15.972 --> 51:17.439
You know, after your
midterms.

51:17.507 --> 51:18.872
Right.

51:18.942 --> 51:21.308
- Thanks a bunch.
- You're welcome.

51:21.378 --> 51:22.743
So what else is going on?

51:22.813 --> 51:25.281
Well, guess who had the nerve
to pull me over today?

51:25.348 --> 51:26.679
What, no idea?

51:26.750 --> 51:28.684
Fucking Darren!

51:28.752 --> 51:31.220
- Darren?
- Yeah, Darren.

51:31.288 --> 51:34.257
Oh, and this place just
gets better and better.

51:34.324 --> 51:37.157
Not only did I run into
psycho-stalker

51:37.227 --> 51:39.252
but Lisa disappeared
last night with some dough boy

51:39.329 --> 51:40.626
from your favorite bar.

51:40.697 --> 51:42.460
- And she hasn't shown up, yet? - No.

51:42.532 --> 51:45.194
Her phone keeps going
straight to voice-mail.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.462
If it makes you feel better,

51:46.536 --> 51:48.094
I'll put a call into
the station.

51:48.171 --> 51:50.469
You remember what
kind of vehicle she left in

51:50.540 --> 51:52.770
or the name of the, uh...

51:52.843 --> 51:54.936
friend she, um,
might have been with?

51:55.011 --> 51:57.138
No idea on both counts.

51:57.214 --> 51:59.239
Well, I'll take care
of it, all right?

51:59.316 --> 52:00.908
And don't you
worry about Darren,

52:00.984 --> 52:02.975
you will not be seeing him
again, okay?

52:03.053 --> 52:04.418
Thanks, Daddy.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.984
And look, you girls
want to have a fun evening?

52:08.058 --> 52:10.151
I left some supplies in
the garage for you.

52:10.227 --> 52:11.455
Supplies?

52:11.528 --> 52:12.756
What kind of supplies?

52:12.829 --> 52:14.353
Bingo?

52:14.431 --> 52:15.398
Canasta?

52:15.465 --> 52:16.591
No, you little wise guy.

52:16.666 --> 52:18.531
Some party favors
from a shindig

52:18.602 --> 52:20.399
I had just
a little while ago.

52:20.470 --> 52:21.835
Party supplies?

52:21.905 --> 52:22.837
Great.

52:22.906 --> 52:23.838
Thanks, Daddy.

52:23.907 --> 52:26.034
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

52:26.109 --> 52:27.599
Oh, I got to go, my--

52:27.677 --> 52:29.542
my seminar starts
in a few minutes.

52:29.613 --> 52:31.376
##

52:31.448 --> 52:33.439
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Bye.

52:33.517 --> 52:35.007
Oh, wait, wait, hold on.

52:35.085 --> 52:36.916
You don't go anywhere,
you little minx.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.978
I got something for you.

52:39.055 --> 52:40.716
You don't go anywhere.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.781
And don't forget, you owe me
that rub and tug.

52:42.859 --> 52:44.952
- Well?
- Well, what?

52:45.028 --> 52:47.121
What did he say
to do about Lisa?

52:47.197 --> 52:49.495
He didn't say to do
anything about Lisa,

52:49.566 --> 52:52.000
but he said he'll put a call
into his old station.

52:52.068 --> 52:53.899
I'm sure she'll be fine.

52:53.970 --> 52:56.803
##

52:56.873 --> 52:58.602
Oh...

53:01.811 --> 53:02.979
Kel, could you come with me?

53:02.979 --> 53:04.378
I could use
your help for a sec.

53:06.483 --> 53:08.041
- Okay.
- Thank you.

53:09.719 --> 53:12.654
Ooh, I wonder what
kind of party supplies.

53:13.890 --> 53:15.687
So?

53:18.128 --> 53:19.152
Is this the one?

53:19.229 --> 53:20.389
You look great.

53:20.463 --> 53:21.395
Perfect.

53:21.464 --> 53:22.624
Thanks,
but I don't know,

53:22.699 --> 53:25.327
I feel like I'm just
going to fall out.

53:25.402 --> 53:26.699
If you want to wear something
more conservative,

53:26.770 --> 53:28.567
you can borrow mine.

53:28.638 --> 53:29.764
I've brought extras.

53:31.841 --> 53:33.172
Uh...

53:33.243 --> 53:35.871
Uh, where are
you going?

53:35.946 --> 53:38.176
It's just us in the house,

53:38.248 --> 53:39.806
and we've
seen them before.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.214
Well...

53:43.753 --> 53:45.084
All right.

53:52.596 --> 53:55.656
##

54:24.427 --> 54:25.587
What's with
the hula gear?

54:25.662 --> 54:27.687
Is somebody having a luau?

54:27.764 --> 54:29.595
Apparently we are.

54:29.666 --> 54:30.894
My dad mentioned
something about

54:30.967 --> 54:32.059
Ieftover party supplies.

54:32.135 --> 54:35.070
I thought it was booze,
but, uh, we got this.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.074
So I guess you put
these in the backyard.

54:40.143 --> 54:43.237
Yeah, and the three of us will
take these out front.

54:43.313 --> 54:44.245
Bottoms up.

54:44.314 --> 54:46.874
Thanks, I'll try not
to drink it.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.474
You do that.

54:48.551 --> 54:53.079
##

55:09.973 --> 55:11.770
One down.

55:11.841 --> 55:13.570
Kelly...

55:13.643 --> 55:15.873
Yeah?

55:15.945 --> 55:16.969
Don't you think that'd
work better

55:17.047 --> 55:19.709
if we put
fuel in there first?

55:19.783 --> 55:21.478
Oh, right.

55:21.551 --> 55:22.745
I get it.

55:24.587 --> 55:25.519
What?

55:25.588 --> 55:27.283
Is that the same
cop car from before?

55:28.725 --> 55:29.657
Hey!

55:29.726 --> 55:30.715
Oh, shit!

55:30.794 --> 55:32.261
I see you, asshole!

55:32.329 --> 55:33.887
Get off my property!

55:33.963 --> 55:36.261
Hey, I'm more
than 100 feet away.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.096
There's nothing
you can do!

55:39.336 --> 55:40.360
- man: Darren!
- Ahh!

55:40.437 --> 55:42.098
I know
you can hear me!

55:42.172 --> 55:44.697
That's right, bitch!

55:44.774 --> 55:46.366
Go for Darren.

55:46.443 --> 55:48.877
Get your ass to
1302 Beachside Road,

55:48.945 --> 55:51.539
Daytona Beach, ASAP!

55:52.782 --> 55:54.147
And don't come back!

55:57.854 --> 55:59.151
- Fuck!
- Should we be concerned?

55:59.222 --> 56:00.416
He never hit you
or anything, right?

56:00.490 --> 56:02.253
No, it wasn't
anything like that.

56:02.325 --> 56:05.419
All lit out back.

56:05.495 --> 56:07.463
Is everything okay?

56:07.530 --> 56:08.758
What did we miss?

56:08.832 --> 56:10.424
Everything's fine.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.798
Just another visit
from Deputy Douche Bag.

56:12.869 --> 56:14.769
Next time your little
policeman friend shows up,

56:14.838 --> 56:16.237
I'm calling the real cops.

56:16.306 --> 56:18.206
Look, I told you,
my dad's taking care of it.

56:18.274 --> 56:21.300
He's gone, drop it.

56:23.446 --> 56:25.346
Showtime.

56:25.415 --> 56:26.404
Shit!

56:26.483 --> 56:28.383
Oh, my God!

56:28.451 --> 56:30.180
Whoa, get out of my way.

56:30.253 --> 56:31.743
What's up, boys?

56:31.821 --> 56:33.686
Glad you
could make it.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.190
Someone recovers quickly.

56:35.258 --> 56:39.285
##

56:39.362 --> 56:40.329
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hey, Rebecca.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.456
I like the one in blue.

56:42.532 --> 56:46.969
##

56:57.213 --> 56:58.510
Look at that donkey, man.

56:58.581 --> 56:59.843
Why do you say, donkey?

56:59.916 --> 57:01.213
It's an ass, man.

57:01.284 --> 57:02.774
- What in the fuck?
- Oh, ass, okay, okay.

57:02.852 --> 57:04.342
Drink your beer, man.

57:04.421 --> 57:06.719
##

57:06.790 --> 57:08.519
Come on,
you dirty girl.

57:08.591 --> 57:10.616
Yeah...

57:19.102 --> 57:21.036
Come on, drink up.

57:26.509 --> 57:27.999
Okay, now for that
audition.

57:28.077 --> 57:32.241
##

57:41.658 --> 57:43.421
Drink up,
it's a party.

57:45.628 --> 57:46.856
Hold on a second.

57:48.264 --> 57:50.027
I wanna go for a ride!

57:56.773 --> 58:00.573
##

58:00.643 --> 58:02.543
If you're going to kiss me,
kiss me for real.

58:05.081 --> 58:07.345
What, do I have bad breath
or something?

58:10.653 --> 58:12.314
Whoo!

58:14.157 --> 58:17.490
That would look
so cute on you!

58:17.560 --> 58:19.494
What are you doing?

58:22.665 --> 58:24.064
Yeah, right.

58:24.133 --> 58:26.101
Did you witness
the beheading?

58:26.169 --> 58:27.136
No.

58:27.203 --> 58:28.795
The whole thing happened
upstairs,

58:28.872 --> 58:30.806
but the head
fell right into my shot.

58:30.874 --> 58:31.966
And I was thinking,

58:32.041 --> 58:35.533
whoa, this footage has got to be
worth something.

58:41.951 --> 58:44.010
I'm telling you, Sheriff.

58:44.087 --> 58:45.987
There's got to be
a connection.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.920
Look, I'm not going
through this again.

58:47.991 --> 58:49.083
I'm not.

58:49.158 --> 58:51.183
We have two
missing teenagers,

58:51.261 --> 58:52.956
a murder in the same county.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.394
Oh, and what about
the guy hanging around

58:54.464 --> 58:55.795
Missy Pratt's house?

58:55.865 --> 58:58.891
The missing teenagers have been
gone for less than 24 hours.

58:58.968 --> 59:00.799
They're probably
sleeping it off somewhere.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.497
They'll come staggering back.

59:02.572 --> 59:05.268
Hell, they're probably
around here somewhere.

59:05.341 --> 59:07.036
Oh, thanks, Tommy.

59:07.110 --> 59:08.600
Let me take
a look at that.

59:11.614 --> 59:14.947
Well, I'd say your theory is
pretty much a shit piece.

59:15.018 --> 59:16.280
Oh?

59:16.352 --> 59:18.786
Well, unless that
perp you say you saw

59:18.855 --> 59:22.621
was dressed like a monk
and carrying a sword.

59:22.692 --> 59:24.057
That's a war hammer.

59:24.127 --> 59:25.617
A what?

59:25.695 --> 59:27.959
A medieval weapon used by
religious zealots

59:28.031 --> 59:30.829
for purification reasons.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.197
And you learned
this where?

59:32.268 --> 59:35.237
A local
Renaissance festival?

59:35.305 --> 59:37.830
Have any of these
witnesses reported

59:37.907 --> 59:40.535
what make of
vehicle the suspect left in?

59:40.610 --> 59:44.341
I don't think anyone
was paying attention.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.974
Too many other things to
look at around here.

59:48.885 --> 59:50.375
Sheriff...

59:50.453 --> 59:52.045
I have a really bad
feeling about this.

59:52.121 --> 59:54.487
And you've obviously got a disability, right?

59:54.557 --> 59:55.524
Huh?

59:55.592 --> 59:57.423
You know, that
hearing-impairment thing?

59:57.493 --> 59:59.427
Come on, it's either that or
you're just not listening.

59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.520
I mean, do you realize that
you're in direct violation

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.530
of the restraining order

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.430
the former
sheriff put against you?

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.432
I never touched her, I just--

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.968
It doesn't matter,
he's pissed

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.765
and he's threatening
to go to the city council.

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.271
They're questioning
my sanity.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.602
- But you're--
- Shut up.

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.698
Here's the deal.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.572
You stay away from
Melissa Pratt.

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:17.408
You're going to
stay away from Manatee Creek.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.175
As a matter of fact...

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.443
you're off-duty
for the next 24 hours.

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.007
So just beat it.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.218
Go.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.218
But what about the guy
at Missy Pratt's house?

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:35.193
The guy at Missy Pratt's house
was probably a peeper

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:38.392
or some ex-boyfriend
with nothing better to do.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.427
Do you realize, you're putting your entire
career

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.439
on the line
here for an ex-flame?

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:45.838
Get over it, get past it.

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:48.274
Those things
never end well.

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.175
And usually somebody winds up
getting hurt.

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.270
Okay?

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.440
Now listen, I got a dead
celebrity here.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:56.349
I got 50 airheads
wrangling for an interview.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.387
So let me do
my job.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:00:59.682
Get out of here.

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:18.100
man: So, uh, anything else
you want to do for me?

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.506
Yeah, you and me later.

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:24.012
Actually, I got
a girlfriend already.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.480
Well, it's not like we
have to fuck or anything.

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.039
But what about
a little head?

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.448
Wait, wait!

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.645
( Sal )
God, stop, no!

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.950
Jeez, fuck this!

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.187
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, did you see that?

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:42.661
Tha Horrible. ual.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.529
Good God.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.931
Headless.

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.237
Looks like someone's hormones
got the better of them.

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:55.138
Not that I would know
what that looks like!

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.076
Hey, guys!

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.837
Hello!

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.315
Why would you do that?

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.251
Okay, I like porno
as much as the next person,

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.548
but your live show sucks.

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:06.645
Fine.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:08.952
Sorry about that.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:11.118
Maybe we should go somewhere
a little more private.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.855
What do you guys think?

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.723
Tha What? sie.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.927
I could not stand
the sounds of them...

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.104
... for another
goddamn second.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.230
Here, here.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.913
All right.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.109
Uh-huh.

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.448
What are you doing?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.181
That's so bad.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.850
##

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.984
Oh, this is going to
look so good on my reel.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.858
Who's up for
a game of chicken, huh?

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.396
Come on, boys.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.527
Whoo!

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.535
Follow the titties.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:02.743
##

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.279
Ran out.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.541
Who wants
another one?

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.446
Yeah.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:11.578
Okay, I guess I'll just
bring the whole fridge.

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:17.820
What?

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.794
Ah, that's beautiful...

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:25.930
This is movie magic.

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.264
Uh-huh.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.429
What are you doing?

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.302
What?

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.568
That's just bad.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.473
That's just bad,
that's what that is.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.140
Come on, Dirk.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.202
Aren't you
going to get in?

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.478
I'm in the middle
of something here, okay?

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:42.643
Becky?

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.345
Um, I'm fine.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.388
You guys have fun.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.920
- How about you?
- No, I'm cool.

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.960
Oh, come on, don't be
like these two lame asses.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.586
Come on, let's go
have fun.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:56.860
Yeah,
have fun, Eric.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:03.730
So what do you say we continue this
conversation

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:06.240
in the hot tub, huh?

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.141
- Come on, we'll just talk.
- Okay.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:12.113
I won't make you do anything
you're not cool with.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.512
Come on.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.420
What are you
doing out there?

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:23.185
Uh, just give me a second.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.549
Just...

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:39.501
##

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.637
Hey!

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.581
Aren't you our ref?

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.482
Pay attention!

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.952
God!

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.920
##

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.189
The beer's all gone.

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.596
Asshole!

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.260
There's more
in the cooler, no?

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:09.531
What the fuck?

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.874
Nope.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.240
All gone.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.871
Well, somebody
needs to take the run.

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:18.971
Whoo!

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.982
I Can't you go?!

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.779
Bo and I were
just about to win.

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:24.080
In your dreams, bitch.

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.484
- Oh!
- In your dreams, bitch.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.357
Come on, fuck.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.359
Fuck, fuck!

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.691
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.223
Come on, man,
I can do this.

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.764
Wait.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.831
Wait, I feel movement.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.081
Ahh...

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.117
It's showtime, folks.

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:03.486
##

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.097
Mood lighting.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.099
Nice.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.793
You started without me?

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.571
It's cool, baby,
I'll take over.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.642
You're so wet.

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.873
Jesus.

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.589
What the fuck?!

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.489
What the fuck is...

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:39.493
Oh!

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:53.474
##

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.138
Y'all need me to pick up
anything else while I'm out?

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:59.147
Yeah, how about
a bottle of rum

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:01.206
and some hotter guys.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.478
Better stuff
that mouth before I do.

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.383
Fuck you.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.918
# Oh beer #

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.192
# How I love you #

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.095
# Don't you ever #

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.429
# Leave me dry ##

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.307
What the fuck you
looking at?

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.376
See how that works?

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.958
Fuck me.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.051
Shit.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.891
Is that you, Greg?

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:55.163
Hey, Eric, you want to
go smoke a bowl?

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.169
Uh, no, I'm good.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.500
Maybe later.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.097
Come on,
let's go upstairs.

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:03.169
Fucking dick.

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:07.447
Do you guys
want to smoke?

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.541
Yeah, maybe
when we come back down.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.313
You trying to scare me,

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.323
put me on that fucking
Internet of yours?

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.823
Think you're big?

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.359
Big old pile of shit.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.156
Splatter you
all over the fucking--

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.430
Holy fuck!

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.831
Goddamn it, you just cut
my fucking arm off!

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.037
Fucking leg!

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.042
No, goddamn it!

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.636
Get away from me,
you fucker!

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:39.340
Goddamn it, fuck!

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.779
I'll kill you!

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.475
Fuck...

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.247
man: Are you doing everything
possible as a parent,

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.452
to make sure that they only
interact with

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:54.758
other good
Christian children?

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:59.163
Or are there parents lacking
in moral value?

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.598
What is ingrained in them
when you are not around

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:07.665
to control what they
see or what they hear?

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:10.803
And that is why we are having
a telethon.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.904
But we need your help,

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.313
your kindness,

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:17.375
your gifts from the heart to
help us, your donations.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:31.822
Wait a minute.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:34.461
Can we just
slow down for a sec?

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.835
What's the problem?

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:41.133
- I said give me a second.
- What's the problem?

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.609
I thought
you were into it.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.703
I'm-- I'm...

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:47.442
I'm just nervous.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:48.642
Oh, I understand.

01:09:48.716 --> 01:09:50.742
I'm a little nervous, too.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.751
You're nervous?

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:55.017
Sure, I'm just an average
guy, but you...

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.081
you are an
absolute knockout.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.425
Listen, I don't want to
make you do anything

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.758
you're not cool with.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.695
- Really?
- Really.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.502
I just-- I can't.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.304
I'm sorry.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:17.004
I knew I was wasting
my time with the wrong one.

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.774
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me.

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.371
I-- I could be
downstairs right now

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:21.939
fucking that slut, Missy.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:23.507
But stupid me.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.451
See, I thought it would be more
fun to go for the challenge.

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.121
You know what?

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.919
You prudes
are all the same.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.425
Oh, you act like you're
all about it,

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:34.428
but, really, you're
just a scared little girl.

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:42.126
Oh, sweetie, don't cry.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.729
Save the water works for
someone who gives a fuck.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.104
Yeah, I'm going to get
the hell out of here now,

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.406
and go get a blow job from
your friend, okay?

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.139
You wouldn't do that.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:52.510
Yeah, we'll see.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.105
Fucking tease.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:58.779
##

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.594
Come on, Zack,
let's roll.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.824
No, I'm cool.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.229
Plus, Bo's not back yet.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.892
- Why, what's up?
- What's wrong?

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:15.960
Did you have
a little problem upstairs?

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.939
I'm not the one with
the problem.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.100
Don't waste your time, dude.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:22.109
You're not going
to get anything anyway.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.111
This house is full of
cock teases.

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.407
Fuck you, asshole.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.710
You're not even
worth teasing.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.307
Fuck you, cunts.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.876
Whoa, Dirk, cool it, man,
go chill.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.148
You know what, I'm going to get my ass a
cab

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.383
and go to Daytona,
"Crazy Girls" or not.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.481
At least those bitches
know how to party.

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.287
Have fun, loser.

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.289
- Whoa!
- I need to go check on Becky

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.388
and see what your
asshole friend did to her.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.994
No, no, no,
I'll go check on her.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.593
I think I know what happened
up there, all right?

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:50.502
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:54.235
##

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.272
##

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:00.679
( knocking )

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.546
Go away.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.487
God, what?

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:09.524
Does "no" mean "yes"
to all of you?

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.786
I come in peace.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.898
Do you want
to talk about it?

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.834
What's there to
talk about?

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:27.365
I'm just some uptight prude
who led your friend on.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:30.207
Whoa, hey.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.373
Do you really think that
about yourself

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.247
or is that
something Dirk told you?

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:37.945
Let me tell you
something about Dirk.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.749
He's been giving
the same speech

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.347
three times a week since
high school.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:45.188
He calls it
his "Mount Gushmore."

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.760
How could
I be so stupid?

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.765
You're not stupid.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.960
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.799
You're smart enough not to
let it go too far, right?

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.605
Is, uh...

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:02.939
is that your mom?

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.638
Yeah.

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:09.013
Uh, she gave this to me
when I was, like, seven.

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:11.177
It makes me sound
like such a little girl,

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:14.086
but sometimes...
when I look at it,

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:17.250
it just seems like everything
will be okay.

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:21.057
Like she's there to
lead me down the right path.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.722
Sounds stupid, but--

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:23.856
You're not stupid.

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.229
Stop.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.736
It seems like she really cares
about you and loves you.

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:30.601
Seems like you're growing
into quite the young woman,

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.697
not a little girl.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:37.638
That was bad.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.513
No...

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.447
That was--
that's horrible.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.780
That's so bad.

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.410
That's a horrible line.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.682
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.956
What is this?!

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:59.561
Oh, I get it, you get bored
with one and go for another?

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.103
- Missy, you don't understand.
- Sure I do.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.366
Your drama is ruining this
whole fucking weekend.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.805
First, we have
to leave the bar early

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.739
'cause you puke on yourself.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.903
Now, you run off
the best-looking guy in town

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:12.640
because you're scared
to put out?

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:15.342
Oh... what is this?

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.851
Who are you kidding
with this shit, Becca?

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.717
You pretend to be
holier than thou,

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:23.656
but actually,
you're just a selfish bitch!

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.327
Really?

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.660
I'm going to
get out of the pool,

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.893
I'm going to flatiron
my hair

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.196
and I'm going put on makeup

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.829
and I'm going to come up
here and yell at you.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.781
Fucking prude-ass bitch.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:02.126
Beer wagon's back, bitches!

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.858
All right,
I'm going to go help him.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.328
Whoo!

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.281
Hey, who ordered
the monk?

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.290
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.858
Zack probably
pulled down his pants.

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.870
He's crazy.

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:55.250
Okay.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:56.784
I'll get
Becky and Eric!

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.843
You get your phone
and call 9-1-1!

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:00.081
And get Kelly!

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.281
Wait in her room!

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:09.891
Missy, are you
listening?

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.193
Missy?

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.537
Where is
the keys and phone?

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:19.369
In-- in my purse.

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.705
On-- on the bed!

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.810
Fore, motherfucker!

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.509
I'll get my phone.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.279
Wait in my room, okay?

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:34.788
Go!

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.655
Get the phone and go!

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:50.033
Did you come for
the radio this time?

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.436
What is it?

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.192
Okay...

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.601
Okay, okay...

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.105
What do we do now?

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.648
I say we make
a break for it.

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.183
What?
Are you crazy?

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.617
No, I say we wait for
the police to come.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.814
If Mandy called them, who
knows what happened to her?

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.254
I'm with Eric.

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:22.955
Okay.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.556
All right, look,
you two stay here

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:27.602
and lock the door
behind me.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.996
What... fuck!

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.777
Fuck!

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:53.955
Shh...

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.229
Lock the door,
lock the door.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.231
It's okay.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:03.763
##

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.475
Oh, my God,
what's going on out there?

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.841
What the fuck is
going on?

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:13.346
I don't know.?

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:17.374
##

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:53.977
Fuck.

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:00.327
Mandy?

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:02.795
And Kelly?

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:05.799
Look, we've only
got one shot

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:08.028
and it's down that hall.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.866
We can do this.

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:12.099
We have to go...

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.607
Let's do it.

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:14.642
Shh...

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:18.305
##

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.452
Go, go, go!

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.589
Come on,
come on, come on!

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.594
Let's go!

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.125
Oh, my God!

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.601
This way, come on!

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.568
Fuck this!

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:50.975
Get the fuck
out of my way!

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:53.908
No, no, it's going to
be all right!

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.381
Look at me, look at me!

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.747
No, it's going to
be all right!

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.479
It'll be okay,
it'll be okay!

01:20:58.553 --> 01:20:59.918
Look, she's going to
go down fine!

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:02.320
Missy's fine, look,
she's making it down just fine.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.688
Look, she's going to
be all right!

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.028
You have to go now!

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.359
Rebecca, fucking jump!

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:13.060
- You have to go now!
- I can't, I'm afraid!

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.829
You gotta go!

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.371
- I'll be right behind you.
- Go, jump!

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.173
Becca, fucking jump!

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.540
He's going to
fucking kill you!

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.839
Jump!

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.177
- Holy shit!
- Ow!

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.880
Oh, my-- Becca!

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:36.287
Get the fuck up,
get the fuck up!

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:39.020
Run, Becca, run, run!

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:48.401
##

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:51.861
Go, go, go, go!

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:53.965
Run!

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.339
Oh, Darren!

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.904
There's somebody
in the house!

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:01.914
What?

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:04.008
Slow down.

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.416
Who's in the house?

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:06.419
What are you doing here?

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.149
Why are you holding that?

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.919
Come on, I got to get you
out of here.

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:11.924
Where's the backup?

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:13.426
All our friends are
dead inside.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.429
Shouldn't you
be doing something?

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:17.897
What, what...
wait, all dead?

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.433
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure, Darren!

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.196
Do your fucking job!

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.294
Well, I just-- I just
got to get you out of here.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.861
- Come on!
- Wait!

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.305
What's going on here?

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.932
And why haven't you
calling anybody?

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:30.068
I'll tell you why
he hasn't called anyone.

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.772
He's not even supposed
to be here.

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:34.280
I have a restraining order
on this fucking pedophile!

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:40.680
Melissa, you know damn well
I never laid a finger on you!

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.245
Your friend here is
a fucking liar!

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.586
What?

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.785
I loved her and I was waiting
'til she turned 18.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.455
Yeah, well,
that was the problem.

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.465
You know, you brought this
on yourself.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.465
I didn't.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.092
Whatever's actually
going on here tonight,

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.103
I know damn well
it's your fault.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.036
Your slutty ways
have clouded your judgment.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.630
Fucking don't...

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.836
Now, I need to get you
someplace safe!

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:07.538
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:08.946
Who the fuck
is this guy?!

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:11.918
What the fuck is going on
around here?!

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.682
Whoa!

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:16.280
Golly gee, somebody's
got a potty mouth.

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:17.552
What the fuck?

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:20.992
And to answer your question,
I'm Becky's boyfriend.

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:23.394
Ex-boyfriend!

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.558
And how did
you know where I was staying?

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:30.761
Well, when you didn't
answer your phone,

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:34.775
Rosemarie asked if I would
come and check up on you.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.107
She's very worried.

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.304
Do you-- do you
have a phone on you?

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.904
We have to call
the police.

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:43.011
Yes.

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.109
Looks like
someone already did.

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:48.621
Fucking yes or no,
douche canoe?

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.090
Well, duh.

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.127
Miss Manners.

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.593
It's-- it's in my car

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:56.721
and it's just around--
around the corner.

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.959
You tw Yes, thank you. ith me.

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.666
- No, he's not!
- I promise, it's gonna be okay!

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.105
Stop, he's
gonna fucking help us!

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.639
Is there a problem?

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.111
Todd?

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.148
Did you
follow me here?

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:22.381
Sorry to say that I did.

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:26.653
And what I've observed has
been very disappointing.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.922
Oh, what's this?

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:42.337
What the fuck is that,
what is that?

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.968
Becky!

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:45.706
Hmm...

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.213
It's probably
one of the weapons

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.749
that God bestowed upon me

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.182
to kill all your
slutty-ass friends

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.685
who were trying to turn
you into a whore!

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:53.846
We have to get
the fuck out of here.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:56.015
You know, for such
a sweet girl, Rebecca,

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.491
you hang out with some people
with very questionable

01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.618
morals and values.

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:03.662
Like you.

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:13.234
Come on, Eric!

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:23.241
Gosh... darn...

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:24.512
sinner!

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.115
Oh!

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.391
Oh!

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:36.730
Oh, my God, get up,
come on, get up!

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.425
Jezebel!

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:44.166
##

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.512
Oh, God...

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.960
I knew I should have
went to see Willie Aames.

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:10.088
What... what the fuck
is he talking about?

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.191
She's going to be so
disappointed in me...

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.479
It's all right.

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.952
It's over now.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.613
( woman )
It's not quite over...

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:37.751
... yet.

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:01.911
I've been wanting
to do that for so long.

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.612
Mother!

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:07.983
Dear...

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:11.890
can you get away from
the pervert so I can finish?

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.860
Finish what?

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.453
Clearing your path.

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.396
Oh, come now, dear.

01:27:18.466 --> 01:27:20.832
Did you really think that
I wouldn't notice?

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.130
I know.

01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:24.262
Mothers always know.

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.363
No...

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.773
Oh, my poor sweet Rebecca.

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:30.401
The way your face lit up
when they announced

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:33.811
that flesh-fest was
being filmed not far from here.

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.439
These girls holes.

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.074
Now that's what's in danger.

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:43.387
Luke chapter 13,
verse three.

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:46.586
"I tell you no,
but unless you repent,

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:50.290
you will all perish
in the same way."

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:52.196
Don't you see now?

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.394
Todd and I knew you that
you were being influenced

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:56.460
by your friends
and the media.

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.801
It was the devil's work.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.431
We had to make you
see the light

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:03.136
while your soul
was still pure.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:05.975
That's when I asked God what
my next step had to be.

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:08.413
Remove the temptation.

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:12.249
Eliminate any possibility of
your being forced

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.514
to commit
unspeakable acts.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.892
Oh, my God!

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.188
First, the bodyguard.

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:31.797
He was easily swayed by
the promise of sin.

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.206
Next was a girl
who had already given in

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.641
to otherworldly pleasures.

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:41.108
Followed by that pint-sized
minion of Satan.

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:43.275
- Crazy Girls!
- Whoo!

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:45.148
Oh!

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.709
Who was given to me
as a sacrifice

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.449
by that despicable man...

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.548
Fuck this!

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.684
... who then took his
own life!

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.784
See you later...

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.091
shithead!

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.133
That was you?

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.470
Oh, my God!

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.370
Beet and Sal are dead...

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:14.475
Great.

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.414
There goes my fucking check.

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:24.854
"Then the lust,
when it conceives, bears sin

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:27.952
"and the sin when it is
full grown

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.998
brings forth death."

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:34.432
James chapter one,
verse 1 5.

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:37.804
So you see.

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:43.101
He simply must die.

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.083
Oh, God...

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:03.990
Die, you psycho bitch!

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:27.083
God, why hast
thou forsaken me?!

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.123
Why don't you
ask him yourself?!

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.035
Hey, come on, come on,
we need to go get help, okay?

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.010
Eat dirt, bitch!

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:58.812
Holy shit.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.952
Darren, what the hell
has happened here?

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.260
I'll put it in
my report.

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:19.531
About that move.

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.165
You've been
holding out on me.

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:23.437
I wrestled a little bit
in college.

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:24.569
Yeah.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.079
I guess I never seen it done
on a woman before.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:29.275
You can ask my ex-wife
about that sometime.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.813
We got a multiple
homicide at...

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:36.687
Manatee Creek, 16301 Johnston.

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.225
We're going to need EVAC.

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:40.920
Four ambulances.

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:44.826
A couple of body bags.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.107
Look at this thing,
Darren.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.843
It's been modified.

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:04.009
Modified?

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.211
Yeah, modified for a woman.

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.913
This is hollowed-out
aluminum,

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.580
Iike a baseball bat
with a sharp edge.

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:09.782
Look at this.

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.392
Please help...

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:19.660
my mother.

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.759
I know what
what she did was wrong...

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.831
Damn you, harlot!

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.805
Ashes to ashes, bitch!

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.511
Whoa!

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.077
Whoa, forget the ambulances,
we need a fire truck.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:03.510
##

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:22.615
I'm so happy to be in
Crazy Girls Unlimited.

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.550
I'm a crazy girl.

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:31.861
Crazy girls!

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:37.234
I love
Crazy Girls Unlimited.

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:39.169
Ladies, step in and
give him a belly rub.

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.940
Hey!

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:45.137
I can rub some.

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.510
man: We don't need you
to talk.

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:49.276
Crazy Girls!

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.284
Unlimited.

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:55.088
Whoo!

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:59.615
Tell me Sheriff, do you
watch Crazy Girls videos?

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:02.094
Well, you know
what they say, Holly.

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:04.961
One man's trash is
another man's treasure.

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:08.559
##

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:10.627
As you can plainly see,

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:14.072
these three gorgeous girls
are throwing down on me.

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:17.110
I'd rather them
going down on me.

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:20.614
Our savior rose
from the dead...

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:23.809
And these girls could
raise anything,

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:26.079
including the dead.

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:31.887
I am praying
for a $1,000 angel.

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:35.361
What kind of angel
are you?

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:37.329
I'm the angel of the tits.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:40.595
And then in
the Garden of Eden,

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.067
the snake said...

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:45.731
Put your ass in the air
and touch your toes.

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.774
Hallelujah!

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.469
Open your wallet.

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.033
Pick up the phone

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:53.910
and call the number
below and say...

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.448
Fuck you, Dominic!

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.450
Jesus saves and--

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:59.486
Jesus does save.

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:02.283
He's saving all that money
you're sending to me

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:04.483
and I'm spending it
probably on little boys,

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:05.957
if you know what
I'm saying.

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:08.392
##

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:20.567
I've got a boner.

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.040
Sound rolling.

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:24.100
man: 107D, take one,
soft sticks.

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:25.770
Action.

01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:28.815
Action...
happy leprechaun.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:30.009
man: Now look at
their tits.

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:31.108
Look at your tits.

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.777
man: No, look at them, really look at their
tits.

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.013
Oh, look at those.

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.749
Whoo, whoa!

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.984
- man: I got a lot of hos.
- Oh, I got a lot of hos.

01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:40.618
- man: Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:43.356
- man: We're Crazy Girls!
- We're the Crazy Girls!

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:44.897
man: Girls say that.

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:47.695
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:50.066
Oh, tits.

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:52.870
Bless the America.

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.305
man: All right, Beetlejuice,
now be nasty.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.138
Ooh, nasty!

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:01.945
##

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.008
Excuse me,
I need a piss.

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.758
Can we get those body bags
over here?

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:22.924
I think I love you.

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:24.191
Oh...

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:32.705
It's good to be
the King.

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:35.207
Is this serious?

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:38.439
You pile-drive
people and you take my girl?

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.104
What is this?

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.340
Shut up.
