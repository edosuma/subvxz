Hal, the Tri-City area

by a surprise blizzard.

of accumulation
we've already endured overnight.

All major roadways

00:45.654 --> 00:47.621

00:47.623 --> 00:50.257
Area businesses are shut down

the five-alarm sauce.

is coming to life
and going on a rampage.

to track
the snowmen's movements.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.982
I'm guessing that means
there's also bad news.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.317
The bad news is that

06:17.319 --> 06:18.718
all the snowmen
seem to be converging

06:18.720 --> 06:19.986
on a single location.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.521
What location?

06:21.523 --> 06:22.655
Your house.

Everyone's after you.

06:56.558 --> 06:57.590

Go ahead,

Tell us what?

Hold up... the mall, then here.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.298
They're not after me.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.299
They're after you.

07:08.035 --> 07:09.836
Look, I wanted more air time,
all right?

07:09.838 --> 07:11.404
So I bought a weather machine...

07:11.406 --> 07:13.573
To create the snowstorm
of the century.

07:13.575 --> 07:16.075
But I don't know what's going on
with all these snowmen.

07:16.077 --> 07:17.410
It's not my fault, okay?

07:17.412 --> 07:18.778
Maybe the weather
machine was faulty.

07:18.780 --> 07:19.779
Did you buy used?

07:19.781 --> 07:21.447
Pre-owned.

07:21.449 --> 07:22.682
The salesman said
it had only been used once

07:22.684 --> 07:23.917
for some attack on Canada.

07:23.919 --> 07:26.019
A weather machine
needs a lot of water

07:26.021 --> 07:27.086
to create a storm this big.

07:27.088 --> 07:28.421
I got the water from some lake.

what that means.

Here's the sitch...

Summer says the weather machine
is hovering over her TV station.

07:41.436 --> 07:43.469
Kimmie-Cup, you need
to get to that machine.

07:43.471 --> 07:43.971
But, Dad...

07:43.972 --> 07:45.338
No buts.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.639
We'll hold off
the zombie snowmen, dear.

07:46.641 --> 07:48.575
Here, you'll need these.

07:48.577 --> 07:49.909
I have a better plan.

07:49.911 --> 07:51.077
Let's just throw her outside
and be done with it.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.445
She's the one they want.

07:52.447 --> 07:54.013
Now hold it right there, mister.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.783
Either you're with us, or
you're with the zombie snowmen.

07:56.785 --> 07:58.418
There's an army
of them out there.

It's impossible.

Turn down the drama, Ron.

10:35.977 --> 10:37.744
Once we dump the water
back into the lake,

everything will be fine.
