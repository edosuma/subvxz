Come and earn
your keep for a change.

No, I'm practicing for
our neighbours' clay shoot.

00:17.609 --> 00:20.112
Honestly, Donald, you
never lift a finger to help.

00:20.195 --> 00:21.906
You spend money like water,
drink like a fish,

00:21.988 --> 00:24.198

body weight three times a day.

of penny pinching...

your pocket money already,
have you?

-Where are you off?

We could walk
down to the loch.

13:09.464 --> 13:10.506
Investment.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.800
(LAUGHING)

13:12.884 --> 13:14.636
Thank you.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.514
Jewellery's the way to
a lady's heart, Ewan.
Make a note of it.

13:18.599 --> 13:21.435
Well, I'd take the price off
it because no bird's going
to put out for a quid.

13:21.518 --> 13:23.062
DONALD: Â£1.99!

13:28.900 --> 13:33.614
Oh, where's your cap then?
It's not in your hand, is it?

13:33.697 --> 13:35.698
You're not scared of a little
competition are you, Chester?

13:35.782 --> 13:38.619
Look, look, look,
if you fancy the woman,
then please say so but...

13:38.702 --> 13:41.329
Just drop all this
entrepreneur stuff, eh?

13:41.413 --> 13:44.291
-I'm supporting
a local business.
-Don't you mean the bank is?

13:44.374 --> 13:46.167
I bring a lot more
than money, Chester.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.294
Ah, let me guess...
Local knowledge, eh?

13:48.378 --> 13:52.675
Can be useful. For example,
you're parked under where the
starlings perch.

13:52.757 --> 13:54.092
Oh!

13:56.971 --> 13:58.764
All right, boys.

13:58.846 --> 14:00.598
It's just gone half past 8:00
and it's time

14:00.682 --> 14:02.850
for a special competition
with a great prize.

14:02.934 --> 14:07.855
And tonight, there's one for
all you guys out there.

14:07.939 --> 14:12.235
One very special guy
could win the Rob Roy Radio
dream date...

14:12.318 --> 14:15.697
She's gorgeous,
she's a ghillie
and she's all girly.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.616
And lads, she's looking
for a great kisser.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.494
He will be kind,

14:20.577 --> 14:24.331
sensitive.
A steady kind of a guy.

14:24.414 --> 14:27.126
And he won't look like
someone sat on his face
while it was still wet.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.837
If that's what's staring back
from your mirror,

14:29.920 --> 14:33.257
you could be on your way
to Rob Roy's dream date.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.092
You know the number.
Get dialling.

14:36.175 --> 14:40.638
# Rob Roy Radio! Rob Roy! #

14:46.436 --> 14:47.730
Izzy.

14:47.812 --> 14:49.731
-This is nice.
-Lucy.

14:49.815 --> 14:51.107
And Paul.

14:51.983 --> 14:54.027
Great.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.112
Now we said we were
going to see loads more
of each other, didn't we?

14:56.821 --> 14:58.782
-Evening.
-Hi.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.200
-Isobel.
-Paul.

15:01.284 --> 15:03.245
-Evening, Paul.
-Dougal.

15:03.329 --> 15:06.998
Oh, let's not bother with
menus when Paul can advise.

15:07.082 --> 15:09.751
-You don't need me
to order for you.
-Who else?

15:09.835 --> 15:13.379
Unless this local knowledge
isn't all it's cracked
up to be.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.008
-Okay, the venison's good.
-Fairly safe bet.

15:17.092 --> 15:19.719
-Yeah, when it comes
from my estate.
-LUCY: Touche.

15:19.802 --> 15:22.430
-To start, the duck.
-Shoot it yourself, did you?

15:22.513 --> 15:23.973
-Golly.
-Gosh.

15:26.309 --> 15:29.145
CALLER: (OVER SPEAKERS)
I find the countryside
really, really interesting.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.650
In fact, you're probably
not going to believe this,
but my favourite film.. .

15:32.733 --> 15:37.445
My favourite ever film,
is actually The Lion King.

15:40.991 --> 15:43.034
Maybe we could
place our relish here.

15:43.117 --> 15:45.454
It's not our relish yet, Paul.
Remember?

15:45.537 --> 15:47.413
He can't stand losing, Paul.

15:47.497 --> 15:51.292
Something you'll find out
at his so-called social
clay pigeon shoot.

15:51.376 --> 15:53.295
It's not about
winning or losing, Lucy.

15:53.379 --> 15:55.797
It's about what's
best for Isobel,

15:55.880 --> 15:57.340
and her excellent product.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.509
PAUL:
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
we've had an order

15:59.592 --> 16:01.511
placed by the local shop
which we're going to honour.

16:01.595 --> 16:04.806
Fine.
After that it's a clean slate.

16:04.890 --> 16:08.936
-May I be included in
this conversation?
-Of course, Isobel. Sorry.

16:09.018 --> 16:12.355
So, which is it to be?
Paul's well-meaning
D-I-Y approach?

16:12.438 --> 16:16.151
-D-I-Y?
-Or my proven track record
of making lots of money?

16:16.234 --> 16:19.446
Can't we find a way that
you can both be involved?

16:19.529 --> 16:20.863
I don't think that'll
work, somehow.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.951
No, we need the clarity.
One or the other.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.702
Great. Thanks.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.705
That way I'm bound to offend
one of my neighbours,

16:27.788 --> 16:29.831
one of whom happens
to be my landlord.

16:29.915 --> 16:33.501
There is a way out of this.
We could shoot for it.

16:33.585 --> 16:35.378
Ooh, goody. A duel?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.298
Clays, Lucy.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.591
The stage is set.

16:39.674 --> 16:42.219
I mean, my clay shoot's only
a couple of days away.

16:42.303 --> 16:47.141
I can introduce myself
to Highland society and,
at the same time,

16:47.224 --> 16:51.519
win myself an investment
opportunity. What do you say?

16:51.604 --> 16:55.273
Well, I can't imagine it's
what Isobel would want.

16:55.356 --> 16:59.819
Okay, fine, look,
we'll deliver the order
tomorrow and call it quits.

16:59.903 --> 17:01.821
Chester's far better
qualified than I am.

17:01.905 --> 17:04.324
I rather fancied
the shootout myself.

17:04.407 --> 17:06.743
What do you say, Isobel?

17:06.826 --> 17:09.954
I say, let the best man win.

17:10.539 --> 17:11.955
(LAUGHING)

17:12.040 --> 17:13.082
Brilliant.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.752
-Are you sure?
-Hmmm.

17:15.835 --> 17:21.465
Excellent! Sport, stakes,
guns, maiden's favours.

17:21.549 --> 17:24.301
I'm quite overcome.

17:24.386 --> 17:29.682
CALLER 2:
My interests include fighter
aircraft, 1939 to present day.

17:29.766 --> 17:34.854
And I am a keen
metal detectorist, which is
incidentally the correct term.

17:34.938 --> 17:39.108
Um, what more can
I tell you to interest
the young lady?

17:39.192 --> 17:41.611
Um, how to spell detectorist.

17:42.738 --> 17:44.531
Food okay then, Chester?

17:44.614 --> 17:45.949
Yeah, fine.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.533
Would you excuse me?

17:51.454 --> 17:53.248
I don't believe it.

17:53.331 --> 17:55.374
-Do you want me to get it?
-No, it's fine.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.043
It's not fine.
You haven't got your wallet.
I'll get it.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.211
No, it's fine.

17:58.293 --> 17:59.629
Sorry, Paul, new barman.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.216
I'll place this on
the Laird's account.

18:08.638 --> 18:11.641
Obviously this is ridiculous
and completely out of hand.

18:11.725 --> 18:14.269
You can't back out now.

18:14.352 --> 18:15.520
I'm not going to back out.

18:15.604 --> 18:17.314
And, by the way,
the whole relish thing

18:17.398 --> 18:19.024
was my idea in
the first place.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.651
Pistols at dawn then.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.280
Choccy?

18:28.409 --> 18:31.953
CALLER 3:
And I sport a pretty
impressive beard,

18:32.036 --> 18:35.165
which the ladies seem
to find most attractive.

18:35.248 --> 18:39.669
I enjoy long walks and
quiet conversations.

18:40.713 --> 18:41.921
Hello?

18:42.923 --> 18:44.049
Hello!

18:46.886 --> 18:48.303
A beard?

18:57.228 --> 19:00.356
-Thank you for
a lovely evening.
-My pleasure.

19:01.191 --> 19:02.483
And, yes.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.402
Yes, what?

19:04.486 --> 19:06.988
Yes, you can see me
again tomorrow if you like.

19:07.071 --> 19:09.908
(LAUGHING)

19:09.991 --> 19:11.869
Do you always say exactly
what's on your mind?

19:11.951 --> 19:15.623
Pretty much. Life's too
short to play games.

19:15.706 --> 19:17.875
I've got some business
with Isobel in the morning.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.668
Afterwards then?

19:19.751 --> 19:22.003
We could walk,
I'll show you some
of the estate, if you like.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.048
Brilliant.

19:31.095 --> 19:34.141
Put us down for
6,000 Nippon Koga.

19:34.224 --> 19:35.726
Yeah.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.978
-Hello?
-LUCY: Hello.

19:38.061 --> 19:40.396
-Hello?
-Hello...

19:40.939 --> 19:42.690
Ah...

19:42.774 --> 19:45.985
Come on, Lucy, I'm going mad
here! There's nothing to do!

19:46.069 --> 19:47.737
That's why you bought it.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.785
And the other one.

19:53.868 --> 19:56.704
You're my PA,
not my flaming mother!

19:56.789 --> 19:58.331
(COUGHING)

19:58.414 --> 20:01.293
And if I were you
I wouldn't get too close
to that Paul geezer...

20:01.377 --> 20:03.253
It's a small community.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.714
You can have these back
if you promise to be good.

20:05.798 --> 20:09.134
Well, give us the brandy
at least. I only had two
glasses at supper.

20:11.761 --> 20:14.557
-To the duel.
-That was very bad of you.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.267
(LAUGHING)

20:16.350 --> 20:18.226
Why couldn't you leave
them to do their little
relish stuff in peace?

20:18.309 --> 20:20.229
Because I miss it, Luce.

20:20.312 --> 20:21.855
It's the only thing
I do really well.

20:21.939 --> 20:24.524
Taking a seedling
company and bringing it on.

20:24.608 --> 20:26.609
It would be so good to
get back in the saddle.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.904
In a small, low stress way.

20:29.988 --> 20:31.614
You're expecting to win then?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.659
I'm a fairly
decent shot, yeah.

20:33.741 --> 20:36.077
And Paul was an NCO
in the Para's.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.206
They tend to put in the
hours on the popgun practice.

20:39.289 --> 20:41.834
He is full of surprises,
isn't he?

20:41.917 --> 20:43.334
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:43.418 --> 20:45.296
I might just have to give him
a surprise of my own.

20:48.507 --> 20:49.758
(BEEPING)

20:53.554 --> 20:55.471
There's some more for you.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.391
-Hi.
-BOTH: Hi.

20:57.474 --> 20:59.851
-Saw your car.
-Ta-da!

20:59.934 --> 21:03.229
-Oh, they're great!
-I hope the locals think so.

21:03.313 --> 21:06.024
I've got to get
them in somehow.
I don't know what else to do.

21:06.107 --> 21:09.027
-They're fine.
-I'll help put them up,
if you like.

21:09.111 --> 21:11.487
-Thanks, Jess.
-Okay. Later.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.032
-Bye.
-See you later.

21:13.115 --> 21:14.658
Some more there.

21:15.826 --> 21:17.744
Morning.
Where do you want the veg?

21:17.827 --> 21:20.748
Anywhere.
Butter that, will you?

21:22.874 --> 21:24.876
I'm on with your Dundee cake.

21:24.959 --> 21:29.131
My gratitude is as a
bottomless well from which
I shower you with benisons.

21:29.215 --> 21:31.967
-What's a benison?
-Oh...

21:32.051 --> 21:35.178
Blessings. When they come
along they should be shared.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.682
Picnic for two
any trouble, Ewan?

21:38.765 --> 21:40.683
Got some nice
beef from Isobel.

21:40.768 --> 21:43.562
Yeah, cheese'd be better.
Ooh, ta.

21:46.315 --> 21:48.567
Left with the crumbs,
as per usual.

21:48.651 --> 21:52.111
-You didn't hear the radio
last night, did you?
-No. Why?

21:52.195 --> 21:55.740
Me neither. I watched a video.
Lion King, you know it?

21:55.824 --> 21:59.119
-Hmm-mmm.
Isn't that that kids' film?
-Yeah, true.

21:59.203 --> 22:03.331
Give me a British fighter
aircraft 1939 to present
day any time.

22:03.414 --> 22:04.874
What are you on about?

22:04.958 --> 22:07.210
I was just saying I might
take up metal detecting.

22:07.293 --> 22:09.838
-Eh?
-Or grow a beard...

22:10.672 --> 22:12.173
Oh...

22:12.257 --> 22:15.093
I just thought you might like
to enjoy a quiet conversation.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.388
Yeah, but not with you,
you bam pot.

22:23.893 --> 22:26.729
SHOPKEEPER:
You'll get 50 jars
in there, no problem.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.565
Yeah, the problem is
that's where they'll stay.

22:28.649 --> 22:31.402
-No one's going to see
them back here.
-Nonsense!

22:31.485 --> 22:34.112
And you can take your
eyes off that spot.

22:34.196 --> 22:38.366
I'll not move these wee chaps
for some untried condiment.

22:38.449 --> 22:40.785
You're not telling me
people actually buy these?

22:40.869 --> 22:44.790
They're our most popular line.
Sold throughout
the Scottish Diaspora.

22:44.873 --> 22:47.585
Well, they're naff.

22:47.668 --> 22:51.170
You're fairly new to retail,
Mr. Bowman, I gather.

22:51.254 --> 22:53.464
I fear your career
may be short lived.

22:55.843 --> 23:00.096
Why, Golly, what wouldn't
I do to get back in
your good books?

23:00.179 --> 23:01.681
Thank you, Janet.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.902
Okay.

23:14.778 --> 23:17.739
Moira Kennedy.

23:17.822 --> 23:21.493
-ISOBEL: Lucy seems nice.
-PAUL: Does she?

23:21.577 --> 23:24.621
You took her out
to dinner last night.

23:24.704 --> 23:28.541
I was being welcoming.
New neighbour.

23:30.461 --> 23:32.671
ISOBEL:
I think she's very nice.

23:32.754 --> 23:33.922
So do I.

23:34.505 --> 23:35.715
Do you?

23:37.383 --> 23:39.345
Why the grilling?

23:39.427 --> 23:40.471
Grilling?

23:40.930 --> 23:42.430
Lucy...

23:42.513 --> 23:44.350
I was just
making conversation.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.436
There's nothing between us.

23:49.687 --> 23:50.730
Oh?

23:51.482 --> 23:53.316
We're just neighbours.

24:01.199 --> 24:02.992
-Paul...
-Yes?

24:04.452 --> 24:05.745
I...

24:07.164 --> 24:08.707
You what?

24:10.083 --> 24:12.293
I think she's lovely.

24:14.421 --> 24:16.632
This one's full.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.142
LUCY: Chester's hired
a ghillie, by the way.

24:27.226 --> 24:29.436
He says how do you
fancy making it a four gun?

24:29.519 --> 24:32.231
No problem.
Golly's a great shot.

24:33.398 --> 24:36.317
This ghillie, is he local?

24:36.401 --> 24:40.573
No idea. Name of McGonagall.
Bit of a weirdo, apparently.

24:40.655 --> 24:42.824
Careful, those are...

24:43.909 --> 24:45.118
Slippy.

24:45.660 --> 24:47.162
Thanks.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.873

-Sure.

24:58.006 --> 25:00.633
I have a small gift for you.

25:01.926 --> 25:03.636
North African.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.599
I haggled long
and hard for it.

25:06.682 --> 25:07.891
Silver.

25:09.351 --> 25:13.230
Donald, as you know, I'm
a single woman living alone.

25:13.314 --> 25:18.026
-I hope you wouldn't trifle
with my affections.
-Oh, no.

25:18.109 --> 25:22.197
So, before accepting your
thoughtful gift...

25:22.281 --> 25:24.408
May I ask what it betokens?

25:25.116 --> 25:27.202
My affection.

25:27.286 --> 25:29.330
You'll forgive me if I take
that with a pinch of salt,

25:29.413 --> 25:31.998
given your record
and matters between us.

25:32.081 --> 25:34.208
Why, now everything
is different.

25:34.292 --> 25:36.629
We're no longer children.

25:36.712 --> 25:38.839
We have our own free will.

25:38.923 --> 25:42.259
But if you were to leave
me in the lurch again.

25:42.342 --> 25:43.760
I have a plan.

25:43.844 --> 25:46.639
This time tomorrow
I can reveal it to you,
but not before.

25:48.181 --> 25:50.183
-Do you trust me?
-Oh...

25:51.143 --> 25:52.853
Well...

25:52.936 --> 25:57.398
Of course I trust you, Donald.
Why on earth shouldn't I?

25:57.482 --> 25:59.275
Until tomorrow then.

26:01.486 --> 26:04.322
Before you go,
could you help me up?

26:08.034 --> 26:13.206
My Father, the Colonel,
always used to say to me...

26:13.290 --> 26:17.627
"Rule number one, Lucy,
dry feet, stand easy."

26:19.796 --> 26:22.048
He used to take
us all camping.

26:22.131 --> 26:26.844
I mean, real, rough camping.

26:26.928 --> 26:30.683
I had a suspicion he
wanted us all to be boys.

26:30.765 --> 26:32.893
I've got three sisters,
you see, all older.

26:33.435 --> 26:34.520
You?

26:35.311 --> 26:37.564
No, only child.

26:37.647 --> 26:40.316
Missed all that.

26:40.400 --> 26:44.862
There's eleven of us
now, including spouses
and sprogs various.

26:46.156 --> 26:48.825
We all troop
back for Christmas.

26:48.909 --> 26:51.161
Log fires, carols.

26:53.538 --> 26:55.206
Bit silly really.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.667
Not silly at all.

26:59.127 --> 27:00.671

28:06.862 --> 28:09.490
Marriage is a very
expensive undertaking.

28:09.573 --> 28:11.574

to divorce, in fact.

-Now, on the matter

-Security?

28:19.415 --> 28:23.628
Well, we're delighted to make
the loan but we would
require security.

28:23.711 --> 28:28.174
Ah, well, there's my newly
restored classic car.
Worth double that.

28:28.258 --> 28:32.846
Well, I'm sure it is but it
would have to be property,
Mr. McDonald.

28:32.930 --> 28:38.059
Oh, dear, well I'm afraid
Glenbogle is in my
nephew's name.

28:38.142 --> 28:41.145
Well, perhaps he would
stand as guarantor for you.

28:41.230 --> 28:43.773
I mean, who knows you
better than your own nephew?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.275

28:45.358 --> 28:47.403

sign this though.

The Macintosh shuffle
is reliable...

28:58.705 --> 29:03.710
But it's a bit old hat.
Whereas the Moroccan double
is very popular in here.

29:03.793 --> 29:06.713

I never have, never will.

29:11.844 --> 29:13.761
I very much doubt
if he will either.

What, that guy that failed to
mention he was an ex-para?
Are you sure?

29:17.724 --> 29:22.438
True. Well, we just won't
mention your dark
and murky past then, eh?

the balance, McGonagall.

anything. You're just scared.
-I'm careful.

for a long hard journey.

been more persuasive.

chaps sell like hot cakes.

square up against that, eh?

to fret yourself?

and graceful girls. Watch me.

Ah, it was just
the same with the yoga.
Ever such a nice young girl.

the interest. She didn't
have a Golly to fall back on.

falling anywhere.

feel those muscles. Great.

doing Golly a favour.

enough for all of us.

of you are here?
-Yes.

we mind at all.

40:20.553 --> 40:23.015
So, Uncle, tell me...

40:23.098 --> 40:25.935
Which part of this
did you think was
an especially good idea?

40:26.017 --> 40:29.020
The fraud, the forgery
or breaking the curfew order?

40:29.104 --> 40:31.606
Please tell me I didn't
miss anything out.

40:31.689 --> 40:33.942
I left you the Morgan.

40:34.025 --> 40:36.152
Worth more than the bank loan.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.405
The bank take fraud very
seriously, you know.

40:39.489 --> 40:41.115
I'm going to have
to tell them.

40:41.199 --> 40:42.700
What?

40:42.784 --> 40:44.994
I'm sorry you've
been put through all this.

40:46.663 --> 40:48.248
I deserved it.

40:50.417 --> 40:55.630
All those years ago
she was waiting here.

40:55.713 --> 40:59.592
We were going to be married.
She was everything
I ever wanted, Paul.

40:59.676 --> 41:03.263
You've seen her,
can you imagine?

41:03.346 --> 41:05.266
She was an angel.

41:05.349 --> 41:06.349
(TWIG SNAPS)

41:07.892 --> 41:10.228
And you broke my heart.

41:24.117 --> 41:28.288
I didn't deserve it!
Not to be discarded
in that way!

41:28.371 --> 41:30.332
After all we'd been
to each other.

41:30.416 --> 41:33.543
I deserved at least
an explanation.

41:33.627 --> 41:35.421
Father found out.

41:35.503 --> 41:38.799
I'd packed a small case and I
was sitting on my bed and...

41:41.843 --> 41:44.179
I never could stand up to him.

41:44.263 --> 41:48.558
He bundled me off to some
relations miles away and...

41:48.642 --> 41:50.352
I'm so sorry.

41:50.436 --> 41:53.438
Is weakness your excuse?

41:53.521 --> 41:56.483
I'm afraid in the end
it has to be.

41:56.567 --> 41:59.527
A despicable thing,
I have to have to admit.

41:59.611 --> 42:03.240
It was never indifference
that kept me away, it was...

42:03.323 --> 42:04.867
It was the shame.

42:04.950 --> 42:08.245
After all the fine promises,
all the big talk...

42:08.328 --> 42:10.414
To have to face the shame.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.625
I couldn't.

42:14.042 --> 42:15.627
Until now.

42:17.630 --> 42:20.215
I told you the truth.

42:20.298 --> 42:22.759
I came to see the
old house again, but...

42:23.968 --> 42:27.097
When I saw you...

42:27.181 --> 42:30.058
It seemed an opportunity
to even the score.

42:31.644 --> 42:34.355
What I did was very cruel.

42:34.437 --> 42:35.981
No more so than what I did.

42:36.065 --> 42:40.109
Oh, Donald, as you say...

42:41.236 --> 42:43.322
You were only a boy.

42:43.404 --> 42:46.075
I cried and cried like a baby.

42:47.159 --> 42:49.619
Mother couldn't take it
in the end.

42:49.702 --> 42:53.539
We packed up and we left the
old house to rack and ruin.

42:53.623 --> 42:56.627
-All those memories.
-Yes.

42:56.709 --> 42:59.629
I had no idea.
I'm desperately sorry.

42:59.712 --> 43:01.381
Don't be.

43:01.464 --> 43:03.717
I've had a happy life.

43:03.801 --> 43:06.386
I'm widowed now but...

43:06.469 --> 43:08.264
I've got a loving family.

43:08.347 --> 43:10.265
As I can see you have.

43:10.348 --> 43:13.059
I just wanted to hear
it from your own lips.

43:13.142 --> 43:14.561
That I wasn't a nobody.

43:14.644 --> 43:16.938
Oh! Far from it.

43:17.021 --> 43:19.649
Hardly a day has gone by...

43:19.732 --> 43:21.985
Oh! Far from a nobody.

43:23.027 --> 43:24.947
Do you still have that chain?

43:26.322 --> 43:27.907
Yes.

43:32.328 --> 43:34.539
It's not from North Africa.

43:34.622 --> 43:37.751
It's from the
village shop, Â£1.99.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.796
I'm not only a liar...

43:42.631 --> 43:44.884
I'm a poor liar.

43:44.967 --> 43:47.844
In the sense,
of not having any money.

43:47.927 --> 43:50.638
(LAUGHING)

43:52.725 --> 43:56.604
Perhaps now we can be
a good memory for each other.
Do you think?

43:57.520 --> 44:00.648
-I hope so.
-I'm sure.

44:17.750 --> 44:22.212
It seems I owe you a vote
of thanks, an apology,

44:22.296 --> 44:24.465
a few quid
and a pile of crockery,

44:24.547 --> 44:26.549
in no particular order.

44:26.634 --> 44:30.428
You're a MacDonald,
you're allowed to
be an expensive liability.

44:30.512 --> 44:34.015
In fact,
it's pretty much expected.

44:34.098 --> 44:38.437
But, if you could stop short
of felony next time,
I'd appreciate it.

44:38.519 --> 44:40.146
Hey, Donald.

44:41.439 --> 44:43.400
Make it last. Please.

44:45.486 --> 44:47.445
Lovely. We'll start soon.

44:54.244 --> 44:57.497
Paul, come and meet
my temporary ghillie.

44:57.580 --> 44:59.666
McGonagall, meet Paul Bowman.

44:59.749 --> 45:01.834
-How do you do.
-Hello. That's a nice gun.

45:02.795 --> 45:05.421
Thomson of Aberdeen, 1885.

45:06.339 --> 45:07.716
Very rare.

45:08.633 --> 45:10.468
Nice medallion.

45:10.553 --> 45:14.764
Olympic shooting gold, 1996.

45:14.847 --> 45:17.600
-That's even rarer.
-CHESTER:
Just to even things up...

45:17.684 --> 45:20.145
Sergeant Bowman.

45:20.228 --> 45:22.773
By the way, where is,
what's his name, Golly?

45:39.540 --> 45:42.500
(GUNSHOTS)

45:48.840 --> 45:51.384
Well, we've given
him 15 minutes.

45:51.467 --> 45:53.761
I think a no-show
equals a forfeit, right?

45:53.845 --> 45:55.263
That be the normal way.

45:55.346 --> 45:57.724
Oh, come on,
give him a bit longer.

45:57.808 --> 46:00.102
I mean, just from a fair
play point of view.

46:00.185 --> 46:02.437
It'd be a shame if
you had to forfeit.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.024
But, on the other hand,
off you go, McGonagall.

46:05.107 --> 46:08.651
-Chester.
-No, no, no, all's fair in...

46:08.735 --> 46:10.070
Business.

46:10.778 --> 46:11.822
Pull!

46:11.905 --> 46:14.033
(GUNSHOTS)

46:15.366 --> 46:17.870
Nice shooting, McGonagall.

46:18.661 --> 46:20.997
So?

46:21.080 --> 46:23.708
Golly said he'd be here.
Just give him a bit longer.

46:23.791 --> 46:25.669
Rules is rules, Serge.

46:25.753 --> 46:29.130
Let's bend them then, shall
we? Like good neighbours.

46:29.214 --> 46:31.175
I'm really sorry, Paul,
this is all my fault...

46:31.258 --> 46:34.511
I told him you'd been
in the Army and he's
so insanely competitive.

46:34.595 --> 46:36.764
Whose side are you on?

46:36.847 --> 46:39.099
You wanted the shooting
match in the first place.

46:39.182 --> 46:42.394
-Now I want to make
my investment.
-I'll take the shots.

46:42.477 --> 46:43.853
You're not his ghillie.

46:43.938 --> 46:47.190
Chester, you hired
an Olympic marksman.

46:47.274 --> 46:50.736
No offence anyone, but I think
I'm in a win-win situation.

46:51.527 --> 46:52.988
So, Isobel?

46:53.071 --> 46:54.364
Pull!

46:54.447 --> 46:56.074
Now!

46:56.158 --> 46:58.660
(GUNSHOTS)

46:58.743 --> 46:59.911
Yes.

46:59.994 --> 47:00.995
What kept you?

47:02.331 --> 47:03.331
Sorry, Paul.

Oh, dear, Chester, a draw.

47:42.496 --> 47:45.708
Looks like it's all down
to you now then, isn't it?

47:45.791 --> 47:49.128
-Meg not with you?
-No, she isn't.

Chester, this is wrong.

48:00.972 --> 48:03.266
You're in a much
better position to help
Isobel than I am.

48:03.349 --> 48:05.101
-So?
-So, call it off.

48:05.185 --> 48:07.396
What? You're willing to cede
the match to me?

48:07.479 --> 48:10.607
This isn't about us...
It's about Isobel.

48:10.691 --> 48:12.650
And like you said yourself...

48:12.734 --> 48:16.280
Many times, you're a better
man for the job than I am.

48:16.363 --> 48:18.281
You don't know that.

48:18.364 --> 48:21.451
You're put in the spot, you
never know what you might
come up with.

48:21.534 --> 48:23.161
Have a shot.

48:37.009 --> 48:39.969
-Pull!
-(GUNSHOTS)

48:41.305 --> 48:42.764
-Well done, boss.
-Well done.

48:44.265 --> 48:45.934
(CROWD CLAPPING)

48:47.436 --> 48:50.647
Make the most of it.
I'll beat you next time.

48:55.903 --> 48:59.073
So, we still in business then?

48:59.989 --> 49:02.158
Still in business.

49:02.242 --> 49:05.788
Listen, I know this
relish stuff is really
important, but...

49:05.871 --> 49:10.166
I thought this contest
deserved a proper
Highland trophy. So...

49:10.251 --> 49:13.253
To the victor, the spoils.

49:13.336 --> 49:14.963
I couldn't resist him.

49:15.046 --> 49:18.174
Isn't he the most outrageously
cute thing you've ever seen?

49:29.936 --> 49:32.439
Isn't that where those
awful wee dogs were?

49:32.523 --> 49:34.607
Like the one
that Lucy got you?

49:34.692 --> 49:37.819
Yeah, they must have sold out.

49:40.655 --> 49:43.659
Whoa! What the hell?

50:14.564 --> 50:16.942
Have you nowhere
else to be, lass?

50:20.612 --> 50:23.616
-I see the juniper's
in berry already.
-Really?

50:25.491 --> 50:28.912
-It's a good sign
though, yeah?
-Yeah, it's a good sign.

50:52.852 --> 50:56.689
I, uh, never did
like these. Did you?

50:57.899 --> 51:00.319
They were Father's favourite.

51:00.402 --> 51:02.862
Worthless tat!

Come on.
There's loads of them.
