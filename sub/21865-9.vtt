01:23.968 --> 01:26.472
That was Tony Jarrett talking.

01:26.472 --> 01:27.976
I‐I look forward to it.

01:27.976 --> 01:30.247
Okay, bye.

01:30.247 --> 01:32.418
TRISH (laughs):
Honey. Great news.

01:32.418 --> 01:33.253
(turns off TV)

01:33.253 --> 01:36.559
Hey, young lady,
respect the remote.

01:36.559 --> 01:38.496
Trust me. You're gonna
want to hear this.

01:38.496 --> 01:42.371
A spot just opened up...

01:42.371 --> 01:44.208
at Kellogg.

01:46.379 --> 01:49.351
Okay, I hear the excitement
in your tone,

01:49.351 --> 01:52.024
and then I'm just totally lost.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.526
Honey, Kellogg Preschool.

01:53.526 --> 01:55.998
I put Harper on the wait‐list

01:55.998 --> 01:57.334
before she was even born.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.538
So, we have an interview.

01:59.538 --> 02:01.810
An interview?
Mm‐hmm.

02:01.810 --> 02:03.246
For preschool?

02:03.246 --> 02:05.450
Okay, before you say no...

02:06.820 --> 02:08.389
...look at this.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.525
WOMAN:
At Kellogg,

02:09.525 --> 02:12.799
our state of the art play space
and hands‐on curriculum

02:12.799 --> 02:15.003
bring learning to life.

02:15.003 --> 02:17.942
From our organic farm
to our petting zoo...

02:17.942 --> 02:18.911
Piglets?

02:18.911 --> 02:21.382
(laughing) You're damn
right it's piglets.

02:21.382 --> 02:22.217
Wow.

02:22.217 --> 02:25.423
And, honey,
they have a robotics lab

02:25.423 --> 02:27.594
and a music room designed
by Missy Elliott.

02:27.594 --> 02:29.966
This‐this school is heaven.

02:29.966 --> 02:31.335
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:31.335 --> 02:33.039
I'm listening to the lady.
Okay.

02:33.039 --> 02:35.410
Eight out of ten graduates
move on to the Ivy League.

02:36.412 --> 02:38.316
Your child's future awaits.

02:38.316 --> 02:40.387
Are you a Kellogg family?

02:40.387 --> 02:42.324
You're damn skippy we are.
(laughs)

02:42.324 --> 02:43.626
Yeah, but listen.

02:43.626 --> 02:45.798
I love that you're excited,

02:45.798 --> 02:49.038
but you should know that
they have some strict rules.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.140
Hey, it's okay.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.411
Whatever it is, Harper
can handle it. Look at her.

02:52.411 --> 02:53.714
(Trish laughs)

02:53.714 --> 02:56.820
Yeah, well, the rules
are for you and me.

02:56.820 --> 02:58.489
So they don't allow
television in the home.

02:58.489 --> 02:59.960
No pop culture.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.331
You know what.
I will set that TV on fire

03:02.331 --> 03:04.001
if it means she gets in there.

03:04.001 --> 03:06.840
That makes me very happy, honey.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.911
Okay, so Dr. Weir

03:08.911 --> 03:10.547
will be here tomorrow night.

03:10.547 --> 03:11.682
Okay.

03:11.682 --> 03:15.925
So we have 24 hours to make
ourselves a Kellogg family.

03:15.925 --> 03:16.894
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:16.894 --> 03:19.598
Roger, you‐you cannot
go overboard, okay?

03:19.598 --> 03:20.801
Like you did the last time.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.573
All we need to do
is be ourselves.

03:23.573 --> 03:25.043
And risk her not getting in?

03:25.043 --> 03:26.345
Baby.

03:26.345 --> 03:28.016
Do you know what
happens to children

03:28.016 --> 03:29.551
that do not go to preschool?

03:34.028 --> 03:35.932
Yeah, uh, I'll do the, uh,

03:35.932 --> 03:38.536
porkchops with
no leeks or mushrooms.

03:38.536 --> 03:40.507
Oh, and can I get that
seared and not charred?

03:40.507 --> 03:41.810
Why don't you just
eat the porkchop

03:41.810 --> 03:43.914
the way it's
intended to be eaten?

03:43.914 --> 03:45.183
Excuse me?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.789
I'm just saying, someone put a
lot of work into the porkchop.

03:47.789 --> 03:50.060
You know, if you want to eat
a crappy one,

03:50.060 --> 03:51.329
go home and make it yourself.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.105
Let's get out of here.
We don't need this.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.042
WAITER:
Sir, sir.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.682
What?

04:03.353 --> 04:04.421
I'm doing you a favor.

04:12.839 --> 04:14.641
MOLLY (snaps fingers):
Martin, get over here!

04:14.641 --> 04:16.412
Oh.

04:16.412 --> 04:17.849
What the hell are you doing?

04:19.518 --> 04:21.022
I'm eating.

04:21.022 --> 04:21.990
Martin.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.994
I appreciate you coming in
to support me, I do.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.865
But you've been here
three nights in a row.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.434
Don't you have
anywhere better to be?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.937
Nope.

04:28.937 --> 04:32.644
Okay, let me rephrase.
Before I moved here,

04:32.644 --> 04:34.715
how did you fill your time?

04:34.715 --> 04:35.650
Booze.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.487
Wow, that's depressing.

04:37.487 --> 04:39.558
Okay. (scoffs)

04:39.558 --> 04:41.897
I guess I'll
just make you plans.

04:41.897 --> 04:45.703
I haven't seen much of L. A.
We can explore it together.

04:45.703 --> 04:49.745
I have explored Los Angeles,
and this here is the gem.

04:49.745 --> 04:51.215
Yeah, not an option.
Yeah. (clears throat)

04:51.215 --> 04:52.117
But I have been wanting

04:52.117 --> 04:54.923
to go on those cheesy
celebrity bus tours.

04:56.525 --> 04:59.131
I'm gonna have to give
a firm no, uh, on that one.

04:59.131 --> 05:02.872
Um, besides, you need me here
running defense, all right?

05:02.872 --> 05:05.945
There was a guy who ordered
a steak w‐well done,

05:05.945 --> 05:08.049
and then said, "I need steak
sauce to go on top of it."

05:08.049 --> 05:09.886
Oh, my God, just stop talking.

05:15.096 --> 05:16.499
Uh, wow.

05:16.499 --> 05:19.104
Was that as wonderful

05:19.104 --> 05:21.142
as your face suggests?

05:21.142 --> 05:23.579
Um...

05:23.579 --> 05:24.715
It was excellent execution.

05:25.683 --> 05:27.621
It just took me by surprise.

05:27.621 --> 05:30.493
Well, you have one day
to get rid of that look.

05:30.493 --> 05:32.664
We're going out,
tomorrow night.

05:32.664 --> 05:34.836
Griffith Observatory.
It's a date.

05:34.836 --> 05:36.071
Okay.

05:36.071 --> 05:38.543
Yeah, I'm gonna get you
a box for your steak.

05:38.543 --> 05:40.480
You got to go.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.448
Okay.

05:42.985 --> 05:44.254
(siren wails)

05:44.254 --> 05:47.561
If we want in,
we need an edge.

05:47.561 --> 05:49.231
So I'm thinking, tonight,
for our interview,

05:49.231 --> 05:51.502
I'm gonna put Harper
in a pair of little glasses.

05:51.502 --> 05:54.876
Sort of a baby <i>Hidden Figures</i>
kind of vibe.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.047
Better she learns young, Rog‐‐

05:57.047 --> 05:58.015
life always lets you down.

05:58.015 --> 06:00.687
You know what? That's
dark, even for you.

06:00.687 --> 06:04.494
Now what crawled
up your butt?

06:04.494 --> 06:05.663
Uh... nothing.

06:05.663 --> 06:09.638
Look, if I'm gonna be stuck
with grumpy Riggs all day,

06:09.638 --> 06:11.475
I should at least know why.

06:11.475 --> 06:13.212
Molly kissed me.

06:13.212 --> 06:14.681
Okay?

06:14.681 --> 06:16.719
You kissed your best
friend's girlfriend?

06:16.719 --> 06:17.787
Hey, I'm the victim here.

06:17.787 --> 06:20.093
You sure you didn't
lead her on?

06:20.093 --> 06:22.163
Twitch that little 'stache
in her direction?

06:22.163 --> 06:24.501
Please stop talking.

06:24.501 --> 06:25.503
What's the matter with him?

06:25.503 --> 06:26.538
Kissed his friend.

06:26.538 --> 06:30.013
Ah, the precarious line
between friend and lover.

06:30.013 --> 06:32.083
That's why Bailey and I
haven't given it a shot.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.219
Yeah, that's why.

06:33.219 --> 06:34.655
RIGGS: I'm sure there's
a dead body we can talk about.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.225
Oh, you want to get
in here,

06:36.225 --> 06:37.995
take a look?

06:37.995 --> 06:39.564
Suit yourself.
It's nice and cozy, though.

06:39.564 --> 06:41.669
(camera clicks)
Victim is a white male.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.072
No I. D. Bullet to the head.

06:43.072 --> 06:46.645
Dragged here in a rug
and unceremoniously dumped.

06:47.681 --> 06:48.849
Got your drag marks
right here.

06:48.849 --> 06:53.259
Y‐You want to follow them?
Or you think they'll just...

06:53.259 --> 06:54.561
let us down?

06:55.697 --> 06:57.233
(sighs)

06:57.233 --> 07:00.707
Uh, hey, guys, maybe don't tell
Bailey I was in this Dumpster.

07:00.707 --> 07:03.512
Do you recognize this man?

07:03.512 --> 07:05.583
Sorry, sugar. Don't.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.087
Recognize the rug, though.

07:07.087 --> 07:08.889
Tacky stays with you.

07:08.889 --> 07:10.893
You happen to know its owner?

07:10.893 --> 07:12.263
He's in 4B.

07:12.263 --> 07:13.232
Tom Meanny.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.538
Between us, it was only
a matter of time.

07:16.538 --> 07:17.707
Before what?

07:17.707 --> 07:18.843
Before he snapped.

07:18.843 --> 07:22.150
Always been a few cigarettes
short of a pack, that one.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.652
Real nutjob.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.888
Thanks a lot.

07:34.107 --> 07:35.877
(hinges creaking)

07:41.155 --> 07:42.557
(whistles)

07:44.027 --> 07:45.730
Nutjob is right.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.836
What is all this stuff?

07:48.836 --> 07:54.748
"FAA is curbing the population
using chemtrails."

07:54.748 --> 07:57.821
"Fluoride used in mind control"?

07:57.821 --> 07:58.990
I did not know that.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.595
Yeah, that's because
it's not true.

08:01.595 --> 08:02.964
He's a conspiracy theorist.

08:02.964 --> 08:05.870
The guy's insane.
Is he, Rog?

08:05.870 --> 08:08.742
Or is that what the fluoride
wants you to think?

08:08.742 --> 08:11.114
Hm, twisting things around.

08:11.114 --> 08:13.619
Seeing disaster
around every corner.

08:13.619 --> 08:14.821
Hey, remind you of anyone?

08:14.821 --> 08:18.729
I am just impressed with this
guy's organization skills.

08:18.729 --> 08:20.700
I mean, you can
see everything...

08:20.700 --> 08:22.103
Riggs...

08:22.103 --> 08:24.808
she chose to share
her lips with your face.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.912
Whatever happens next,
will happen.

08:26.912 --> 08:29.684
Everything I touch blows up.

08:29.684 --> 08:31.955
With that attitude,
it just might.

08:31.955 --> 08:33.058
(beep)

08:33.058 --> 08:34.194
Hey, Rog.

08:34.194 --> 08:36.031
(whirring)

08:36.031 --> 08:37.233
I think this thing's gonna blow.

08:37.233 --> 08:39.771
It may not be
the best date ever, but...

08:39.771 --> 08:40.973
No, the laptop.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.779
(grunts)

08:43.779 --> 08:45.783
(rapid beeping)

08:45.783 --> 08:46.818
(beeping stops)

08:49.758 --> 08:52.363
You see? Not everything
you touch...

08:52.363 --> 08:54.901
(explosion, glass shattering)

08:58.275 --> 08:59.177
Yeah.

08:59.177 --> 09:03.152
Maybe it's just best
if you stay single.

09:04.621 --> 09:05.690
Yeah.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.827
♪ ♪

09:13.037 --> 09:15.643
(door opens,
knocking on glass)

09:15.643 --> 09:17.780
Uh...

09:17.780 --> 09:18.782
if you're here for
our appointment,

09:18.782 --> 09:19.651
you're two days early.

09:19.651 --> 09:22.724
I need a psych profile
on a suspect.

09:22.724 --> 09:23.792
Thought you might
want to do some

09:23.792 --> 09:24.661
actual police work
for a change.

09:24.661 --> 09:26.331
So the guys a loner,

09:26.331 --> 09:28.168
uh, emotionally unstable,

09:28.168 --> 09:29.904
has an affinity
for, uh, explosives.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.775
Well, I think I found him.

09:32.744 --> 09:34.814
And he's dragging soot

09:34.814 --> 09:36.318
all over my carpet.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.824
Oh, no, that was,
that was there before.

09:39.824 --> 09:41.128
Look, stay focused, Doc.

09:41.128 --> 09:43.832
"Delusions."
"Erratic behavior."

09:43.832 --> 09:45.436
It could be
paranoid schizophrenia.

09:45.436 --> 09:48.041
But I would have to see him
to give a proper diagnosis.

09:50.413 --> 09:52.417
Was there something else?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.788
I'm good.

09:59.798 --> 10:01.334
It's just that...

10:01.334 --> 10:03.739
Like, I've been on this happy
little island, you know,

10:03.739 --> 10:04.841
for, like, a while,

10:04.841 --> 10:07.045
and‐and things have been
going great with Molly and I.

10:07.045 --> 10:08.215
You know?
We've been hanging out,

10:08.215 --> 10:10.319
things are good, it's easy,
I like her kid.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.822
And then she kissed me.

10:11.822 --> 10:12.957
You know, now it's
ruined everything.

10:12.957 --> 10:17.533
It's not ruined, Riggs.
Your relationship is evolving.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.771
You don't understand.

10:19.771 --> 10:22.877
Molly's the only aspect
of my childhood

10:22.877 --> 10:24.781
that's not a complete disaster.

10:24.781 --> 10:26.918
And the Jake, you know,

10:26.918 --> 10:27.954
there's the Jake thing on top...

10:27.954 --> 10:29.089
Wait. You're hosing me down.

10:29.089 --> 10:30.259
Are you concerned about Molly
or Jake? I'm confused.

10:30.259 --> 10:33.799
It‐‐ Both, you know, Doc.
It's a little bit of a stew.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.068
You know?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.371
Riggs.

10:36.371 --> 10:37.373
If you are looking to me

10:37.373 --> 10:39.310
to tell you that this
is a complete disaster,

10:39.310 --> 10:42.015
you're gonna have to look
somewhere else 'cause...

10:42.015 --> 10:44.154
I don't think it is.

10:46.825 --> 10:48.162
Think on it.

10:48.162 --> 10:49.831
Mull it over.

10:49.831 --> 10:51.968
Because it's a disaster.

10:51.968 --> 10:55.476
Oh, um, sorry about the carpet.

10:55.476 --> 10:58.549
(door opens)

10:58.549 --> 10:59.517
(siren wailing)

10:59.517 --> 11:00.586
BAILEY:
<i>Bad news.</i>

11:00.586 --> 11:03.358
Tom Meanny, the name our
suspect gave the landlady,

11:03.358 --> 11:06.096
it's an anagram for
"Not My Name."

11:06.096 --> 11:07.867
Hm. Good.
Clever and crazy.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.470
She's with the
sketch artist now,

11:09.470 --> 11:11.408
but we did get a hit
on the victim's prints.

11:11.408 --> 11:15.249
Larry Hodson.
Couple of B&Es. Burglaries.

11:15.249 --> 11:17.954
I'm thinking Hodson breaks in.
Tom shoots him.

11:17.954 --> 11:18.989
Good theory.

11:18.989 --> 11:21.194
Better than the Illuminati
raising gas prices,

11:21.194 --> 11:24.968
and the moon landing
being staged in Burbank.

11:24.968 --> 11:26.238
(chuckles)
That's ridiculous.

11:26.238 --> 11:27.373
It was Encino.

11:27.373 --> 11:28.542
Why not Disneyland?

11:28.542 --> 11:30.279
Because it was Encino.

11:30.279 --> 11:31.882
They built a soundstage
and everything.

11:31.882 --> 11:33.017
Wait a minute,
you really believe

11:33.017 --> 11:34.152
that the moon landing was fake?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.990
I suppose
you believe

11:35.990 --> 11:39.998
that Stevie Wonder is not blind.

11:39.998 --> 11:40.933
He goes to Lakers games.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.904
He goes where the Seeing Eye
dog takes him.

11:42.904 --> 11:44.974
What choice does he have?

11:44.974 --> 11:48.047
I think you made your
ponytail too tight.

11:51.020 --> 11:54.894
Looks like our guy
is following this woman.

11:54.894 --> 11:56.932
Think she knows him?

11:56.932 --> 11:58.134
MURTAUGH:
Maybe.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.671
But he's already killed once.

11:59.671 --> 12:00.906
Run those plate.

12:00.906 --> 12:02.443
We got to find her
before he does.

12:11.294 --> 12:12.997
Mrs. Canter.

12:12.997 --> 12:13.999
I'm Detective Murtaugh.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.203
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on here?

12:16.203 --> 12:17.840
Do you know who this man is?

12:18.942 --> 12:20.946
That's Daddy.

12:20.946 --> 12:22.817
What happened? Is he okay?

12:23.919 --> 12:25.255
Bailey,

12:25.255 --> 12:27.025
could you take
this young lady

12:27.025 --> 12:28.027
to get some snacks?

12:28.027 --> 12:28.862
It's okay.

12:28.862 --> 12:30.899
I know what's going on
with my dad.

12:30.899 --> 12:32.536
Is that so?

12:32.536 --> 12:34.006
Yeah. But it's a secret.

12:35.909 --> 12:37.279
My daddy's a superhero.

12:37.279 --> 12:39.249
He's catching
bad guys.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.855
When he's done saving the world,
he'll come home.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.130
Hey.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.600
Do you like Cheese Puffs?
Yeah.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.071
Come on. I have a whole bag
with your name on it.

12:50.071 --> 12:51.975
GIRL: Really? Yes.
BAILEY (laughs): Yes.

12:53.010 --> 12:55.382
We need to talk.

12:55.382 --> 12:57.085
WOMAN:
<i>No, you're wrong.</i>

12:57.085 --> 12:58.488
Jonah's not like that.

12:58.488 --> 12:59.957
He's not violent. He...

12:59.957 --> 13:02.028
He is a wonderful father,

13:02.028 --> 13:03.197
and a loving husband.

13:03.197 --> 13:04.834
You two don't live together.

13:08.274 --> 13:10.278
Not when he's having an episode.

13:10.278 --> 13:11.981
He doesn't want
to upset Kate.

13:11.981 --> 13:14.119
He has episodes?

13:15.556 --> 13:16.758
He's schizophrenic.

13:16.758 --> 13:22.336
We met at MIT, and in 15 years,
he's never hurt a soul.

13:22.336 --> 13:23.338
He's brilliant.

13:23.338 --> 13:26.544
His mind, it makes connections
no one else can.

13:26.544 --> 13:29.484
That's what makes him
such a remarkable engineer.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.725
But when he goes off his meds,

13:33.725 --> 13:37.031
those connections,
they turn into delusions.

13:37.031 --> 13:39.470
The conspiracy theories.

13:39.470 --> 13:43.043
So how long has it been
since you saw him last?

13:43.043 --> 13:44.347
About a month.

13:44.347 --> 13:45.949
And you don't have any idea
where he is?

13:47.987 --> 13:49.055
Sorry. I don't.

13:50.392 --> 13:52.095
Ms. Canter.

13:52.095 --> 13:56.069
If his condition
is as bad as you say it is,

13:56.069 --> 14:01.046
it's for his own safety,
as well as anyone else's.

14:01.046 --> 14:02.115
Try Plummer Park.

14:02.115 --> 14:04.052
He likes to
play chess.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.123
Says it calms
his mind.

14:06.123 --> 14:07.459
(siren wailing in distance)

14:07.459 --> 14:10.264
When we get there,
let me do the talking.

14:10.264 --> 14:14.473
Spend enough time with crazy,
you pick up a few things.

14:14.473 --> 14:17.713
I don't think I like
what you're implying, Rog.

14:17.713 --> 14:21.554
Hey, if the straitjacket fits,
you know?

14:25.662 --> 14:28.033
They're not here for you.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.403
No one
is after you.

14:29.403 --> 14:30.338
Jonah?

14:38.421 --> 14:39.523
What?

14:39.523 --> 14:41.026
I said his name.

14:41.026 --> 14:42.061
It's your tone.

14:42.061 --> 14:44.667
All right. Go.
(grunts)

14:44.667 --> 14:46.437
♪ ♪

14:57.091 --> 14:58.127
I just want to talk, Jonah.

14:58.127 --> 15:00.499
H‐How do you know my name?

15:00.499 --> 15:04.039
Who are you?
(stammers) FBI? NSA?

15:04.039 --> 15:06.209
No, no, no. Uh, just a cop.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.548
See? I got a little shiny
badge and everything.

15:08.548 --> 15:09.550
Stay back!

15:13.223 --> 15:16.330
Hey, I hear
you've got a daughter.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.499
Right?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.369
She can't wait for you
to come home.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.708
No, my family deserves better.
They deserve...

15:21.708 --> 15:23.110
a normal life.

15:23.110 --> 15:24.112
I can't give 'em that.

15:25.247 --> 15:27.720
I just want to make it go away.

15:30.191 --> 15:32.195
Hey, I‐I understand, right?

15:32.195 --> 15:33.397
I mean, my friend kissed me.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.871
Not‐not the fella
I showed up with.

15:36.871 --> 15:39.142
No, no. I mean, he told
me he loved me, which is
a whole nother story.

15:39.142 --> 15:41.581
A girl, you know?
And it's like you said.

15:41.581 --> 15:45.154
Right? She deserves normal,
which I'm never gonna be that.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.358
You know? And you want to know
the big problem, Jonah?

15:47.358 --> 15:48.561
You know the main problem?

15:48.561 --> 15:50.431
I've agreed to go on a date
with this woman.

15:50.431 --> 15:53.170
Right? So if I cancel,
I hurt her now.

15:53.170 --> 15:55.141
If I don't cancel,
I hurt her later.

15:55.141 --> 15:57.044
And I don't know what to do.

15:58.681 --> 16:00.251
(scoffs)

16:00.251 --> 16:01.587
Well, how 'bout this?

16:01.587 --> 16:03.157
Let's leave it to fate.

16:03.157 --> 16:04.827
Okay?

16:04.827 --> 16:06.196
Point that at me.

16:06.196 --> 16:07.432
Point the
weapon at me.

16:07.432 --> 16:08.701
Come on.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.639
There you go.

16:12.776 --> 16:14.212
Now,

16:14.212 --> 16:16.216
you're gonna shoot me.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.753
Okay?

16:17.753 --> 16:19.322
And if I die,

16:19.322 --> 16:20.792
I don't have to go on the date.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.261
(grunts)

16:22.261 --> 16:23.263
Okay, you ready?

16:24.466 --> 16:25.769
(exhales)

16:25.769 --> 16:27.506
You want me to shoot you?

16:27.506 --> 16:28.608
Well, yeah.

16:28.608 --> 16:29.577
You know, I mean, I can't think
of a better excuse.

16:29.577 --> 16:31.581
Right? And you'll be
doing me a favor, so...

16:31.581 --> 16:33.217
Go. Before I change my mind.
Aah!

16:33.217 --> 16:35.054
(shouts, grunts)

16:35.789 --> 16:38.160
(grunting)

16:38.160 --> 16:40.130
Huh. Thanks, Rog.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.399
Now I got to go on the date.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.919
Why are you holding me? I‐I
told you, I didn't kill anyone.

16:50.919 --> 16:52.823
Well, you had a gun.
And you tried to blow me up.

16:52.823 --> 16:56.631
No. I installed a combustible
thermite chip in my hard drive

16:56.631 --> 16:59.402
to‐to control my data,
not‐not hurt anyone.

16:59.402 --> 17:02.275
What about the dead guy
you burrito'd in your rug?

17:02.275 --> 17:03.310
He was in my rug?

17:04.613 --> 17:06.182
Of course.

17:06.182 --> 17:07.485
How did I not see it?

17:09.590 --> 17:11.594
I'm being framed.

17:11.594 --> 17:12.663
Oh.

17:12.663 --> 17:16.369
And‐and why would someone
want to frame you, Jonah?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.639
To keep me quiet.

17:17.639 --> 17:19.242
Something going on.

17:19.242 --> 17:20.244
Something big.

17:20.244 --> 17:21.346
Right here in L. A.

17:21.346 --> 17:23.517
I found out, and now he wants me
out of the picture.

17:26.456 --> 17:28.595
Who does?

17:29.462 --> 17:30.497
Elvis.

17:30.497 --> 17:31.634
Elvis?

17:31.634 --> 17:32.703
Presley. The King.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.607
"Blue Suede Shoes,"
"Hound Dog," "Jailhouse..."

17:34.607 --> 17:37.311
No, no, I'm‐I'm familiar
with his work.

17:38.380 --> 17:40.217
You realize he's dead.

17:40.217 --> 17:41.687
That's what he wants you
to think!

17:41.687 --> 17:43.691
But he's alive,
and he's controlling traffic

17:43.691 --> 17:44.827
all over Hollywood.

17:46.597 --> 17:48.533
(groans)

17:51.239 --> 17:53.543
Traffic? Really?

17:53.543 --> 17:55.447
He's not doing a very good job.

17:55.447 --> 17:57.251
JONAH:
<i>Elvis died</i>

17:57.251 --> 17:59.522
August 16, 1977.

17:59.522 --> 18:02.929
Eight plus 16 plus 77 is 101.

18:02.929 --> 18:04.833
Picking up on
new conspiracies?

18:04.833 --> 18:07.271
Trying to solve a murder.

18:07.271 --> 18:08.608
Too late.

18:08.608 --> 18:10.277
Already got the guy.

18:10.277 --> 18:13.283
Yeah, but we don't even have
hard evidence that Jonah did it.

18:13.283 --> 18:16.556
Besides the dead body and
the gun in his apartment?

18:16.556 --> 18:19.863
Why would he choose
Jonah's place to rob?

18:19.863 --> 18:23.336
And a .38‐caliber bullet
is not exactly rare.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.541
And he did say
Elvis was framing him.

18:25.541 --> 18:26.610
You're losing it, Bailey.

18:26.610 --> 18:30.217
Conspiracies start from reality.

18:30.217 --> 18:32.521
I thought they started
in Encino.

18:32.521 --> 18:33.758
You know what,
it's not funny.

18:33.758 --> 18:35.561
You want to know why?
I don't want to hear it.

18:35.561 --> 18:36.496
Yeah, 'cause Elvis
is still alive.

18:36.496 --> 18:37.632
I don't want to hear
I don't want to hear.

18:37.632 --> 18:39.602
I think I'm losing my mind.

18:39.602 --> 18:40.872
There's a lot of that
going on around here.

18:40.872 --> 18:42.676
When I ran
the victim's prints,

18:42.676 --> 18:44.345
what'd I say his name was?

18:44.345 --> 18:45.749
Larry Hodson. Why?

18:45.749 --> 18:46.951
Right.
I just looked 'em up again,

18:46.951 --> 18:48.788
and now it says
David Lightman.

18:54.465 --> 18:56.737
Something's going on.

18:56.737 --> 18:59.008
Okay, don't get
all conspiratorial.

18:59.008 --> 19:00.712
Maybe somebody
just mistyped...

19:00.712 --> 19:02.448
(trilling)

19:02.448 --> 19:03.283
What did you just do?

19:03.283 --> 19:04.152
I didn't touch it.

19:05.722 --> 19:06.757
We're being hacked.

19:08.627 --> 19:09.763
They must want us to go there.

19:09.763 --> 19:12.434
Maybe they have hard evidence.

19:12.434 --> 19:13.270
Don't gloat,
Bailey.

19:13.270 --> 19:15.541
One hack
a conspiracy does not make.

19:15.541 --> 19:19.549
Elvis is dead, and the
moon landing was real.

19:31.439 --> 19:33.410
Okay, keep your guard up.

19:33.410 --> 19:35.380
We don't know what
we're looking for.

19:35.380 --> 19:36.951
(whirring nearby)

19:40.457 --> 19:42.328
Huh.

19:42.328 --> 19:43.798
What is that?

19:46.502 --> 19:47.571
(speaker feedback)

19:47.571 --> 19:50.510
MAN (distorted): Thank you
for coming, Detectives.

19:50.510 --> 19:51.780
It can talk.

19:51.780 --> 19:54.619
We possess
sensitive information.

19:54.619 --> 19:55.520
Are you ready to receive?

19:55.520 --> 19:57.391
MURTAUGH:
Inform us

19:57.391 --> 19:59.730
of your information!

19:59.730 --> 20:03.704
We are ready to receive!

20:04.773 --> 20:06.509
Why are you talking
like that?

20:06.509 --> 20:07.712
I can't help it.

20:07.712 --> 20:08.680
The thing
makes me nervous.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.448
What do you mean it's
making you nervous?

20:09.448 --> 20:10.818
Now you're making
me nervous.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.388
Well, we both can't be nervous.

20:12.388 --> 20:14.760
Not like you have
to kiss the thing.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.498
Oh, really? You're gonna bring
that up in a moment like this?

20:17.498 --> 20:18.734
I'm just saying.
Hello?

20:18.734 --> 20:21.472
Detectives? Are you done?
(gunshot)

20:21.472 --> 20:24.712
Yeah, we're done.

20:24.712 --> 20:26.917
Did you have
to blow that up, too?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.955
It had information.
It's all right.

20:28.955 --> 20:31.492
It's running off
a short‐range transmitter.

20:31.492 --> 20:33.563
Whoever's operating
this thing's nearby.

20:33.563 --> 20:36.336
Go that way.

20:38.874 --> 20:40.043
(tires screech)

20:41.646 --> 20:43.483
Get out of the van!

20:52.534 --> 20:53.938
Isn't this nice?

20:53.938 --> 20:55.942
Look at this. We're
all talking face‐to‐face.

20:55.942 --> 20:57.478
You know, they don't
do that anymore.

20:57.478 --> 20:58.179
It's sad.

20:58.179 --> 20:59.548
It is sad.
Such a wonderful way

20:59.548 --> 21:00.450
to communicate.

21:00.450 --> 21:02.488
It is.
Don't shoot.
We're on your side.

21:02.488 --> 21:03.590
Larry was our friend.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.793
Then why did
you hack us?

21:04.793 --> 21:06.930
We needed to make contact
without implicating ourselves.

21:06.930 --> 21:07.899
What about a letter?

21:07.899 --> 21:09.135
Or a telegram.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.003
Or Bat‐Signal.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.840
Ooh, a Bat‐Signal's good.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.844
I was gonna say
a courier pigeon.

21:13.844 --> 21:15.647
I like that.
We had to tell you.

21:15.647 --> 21:17.952
Jonah Canter, he's a monster.

21:17.952 --> 21:20.657
A few months ago, we sold
him hacking software.

21:20.657 --> 21:22.929
But we left
a Trojan horse.
Helps us track our clients,

21:22.929 --> 21:25.600
make sure they don't use our
software for anything dangerous.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.870
What was Jonah using it for?

21:26.870 --> 21:29.108
Jonah was researching
megaton bombs.

21:29.108 --> 21:32.514
What he did to Larry,
that's just the beginning.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.458
Your doctor's gonna
meet us at the hospital.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.728
For now, we're gonna give you
a sedative. Is that okay?

21:47.177 --> 21:49.081
You have nothing to worry about.

21:49.081 --> 21:51.854
Be right behind you
the whole time.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.169
(tires squealing)

22:19.976 --> 22:21.947
(car alarm beeping)

22:33.703 --> 22:35.006
(car door closing)

22:35.006 --> 22:37.044
(tires squealing)

22:38.146 --> 22:39.682
Jonah!

22:45.928 --> 22:47.932
CAHILL:
Riggs. What are you doing?

22:47.932 --> 22:51.138
I thought Homeland Security
was taking over the case.

22:51.138 --> 22:52.541
And then what?

22:52.541 --> 22:53.944
They're looking
for a terrorist.

22:53.944 --> 22:55.013
And you're not?

22:55.013 --> 22:57.551
Look, maybe Jonah killed
that guy, maybe he didn't.

22:57.551 --> 22:59.622
All right,
either way, he's sick.

22:59.622 --> 23:01.559
And he's got a wife and daughter

23:01.559 --> 23:02.728
that would like to see him
come home.

23:02.728 --> 23:05.834
I'd like to make
that happen.

23:05.834 --> 23:07.037
You and me both.

23:08.573 --> 23:09.976
Do you want a hand?

23:09.976 --> 23:11.646
Please.

23:11.646 --> 23:13.583
(elevator bell dings)
Here you go.

23:14.285 --> 23:17.224
Oh, good, you're not dead.

23:17.224 --> 23:19.094
Now I can kill you myself.

23:19.094 --> 23:20.563
Molly?

23:22.134 --> 23:24.138
Oh, crap.

23:24.138 --> 23:25.573
Molly.

23:25.573 --> 23:26.409
Um, I was, I was
supposed to call you.

23:26.409 --> 23:28.279
Yeah, no, but you
didn't, Martin,

23:28.279 --> 23:29.581
which is weird

23:29.581 --> 23:30.583
considering you're
in a building

23:30.583 --> 23:32.621
with a hotline.

23:32.621 --> 23:34.124
Listen, believe me,
I was gonna call you.

23:34.124 --> 23:36.162
And I was about to not kick
your ass, but here we are.

23:36.162 --> 23:37.597
I mean, I even made a list,
right? I just...

23:37.597 --> 23:39.101
I'm‐I'm sorry. You made a list?

23:39.101 --> 23:41.172
Yeah, of all the reasons
that we shouldn't be dating.

23:41.172 --> 23:42.574
You know?

23:42.574 --> 23:44.678
Uh, I'm Molly,

23:44.678 --> 23:46.615
by the way.
Maureen.

23:46.615 --> 23:48.686
Oh, it's my, uh, my shrink.

23:48.686 --> 23:50.123
Mm‐hmm. Poor you.

23:52.627 --> 23:54.064
Where's that list?

23:54.064 --> 23:56.001
Well, when you find it,
let me know.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.871
For now I'll just take
my 12 bucks.

23:59.775 --> 24:01.612
What?
For parking.

24:01.612 --> 24:02.814
I take cash.

24:10.998 --> 24:14.004
And I'm keeping
the change.

24:18.246 --> 24:19.314
Shut up.

24:19.314 --> 24:21.051
What?

24:22.954 --> 24:25.126
I like her.

24:25.126 --> 24:26.328
(doorbell rings)

24:26.328 --> 24:28.666
Hi. (chuckles)
Hello.

24:28.666 --> 24:30.971
Come on in. Wow, uh...

24:30.971 --> 24:33.709
Dr. Weir, it is, uh...
a pleasure

24:33.709 --> 24:35.113
to have you in our home.

24:35.113 --> 24:37.050
Oh, it's my pleasure.
These home visits

24:37.050 --> 24:40.690
really let me ground myself
in a child's experience.
Oh.

24:40.690 --> 24:43.129
Well, my child is somewhere

24:43.129 --> 24:44.898
around here, so...

24:44.898 --> 24:46.702
(footsteps approaching)
Here she is.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.775
(Trish chuckles)

24:51.378 --> 24:55.386
This is Roger
and our daughter Harper.

24:55.386 --> 24:57.123
Good evening.

24:57.123 --> 24:59.194
Good evening.

24:59.194 --> 25:01.665
Shall we sojourn

25:01.665 --> 25:03.536
into the dining area?

25:05.773 --> 25:08.112
That sounds lovely. Thank you.

25:08.112 --> 25:09.281
Roger, what are you doing?

25:09.281 --> 25:12.721
Don't worry. I got this.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.858
(sighs)

25:17.731 --> 25:19.735
So, to begin,

25:19.735 --> 25:22.173
how would you describe
your goals for Harper?

25:22.173 --> 25:25.647
Well, we want her
to be happy and kind
Mm‐hmm.

25:25.647 --> 25:27.817
and curious about the world.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.690
Oh, my wife is so modest.
(chuckles)

25:30.690 --> 25:33.696
Harper is already
those things, huh?

25:33.696 --> 25:34.765
(laughs)

25:34.765 --> 25:36.268
Why, just the other day
she said,

25:36.268 --> 25:39.341
"Daddy, where do rainbows
come from?"

25:39.341 --> 25:40.376
My.

25:40.376 --> 25:43.749
Well, for a toddler
her expressive vocabulary

25:43.749 --> 25:45.153
is extraordinary.
Yes.

25:45.153 --> 25:46.922
And‐and that was just
in English.
Oh.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.826
(laughs) She's working
on her Mandarin.

25:48.826 --> 25:52.434
Well, she's very
independent.
Yes, she is.

25:52.434 --> 25:54.104
Are you following
any method

25:54.104 --> 25:56.040
in particular?

25:57.811 --> 25:59.348
Ye‐Yes.

25:59.348 --> 26:01.118
The, uh, Riggs Method.

26:01.919 --> 26:04.658
Oh. Well, I'm not familiar.

26:04.658 --> 26:07.430
It's new. It's very unorthodox.

26:07.430 --> 26:10.069
Uh, very few boundaries,

26:10.069 --> 26:11.004
and‐and...

26:11.004 --> 26:11.939
no bathing.

26:11.939 --> 26:13.275
(Murtaugh and Trish laugh)

26:13.275 --> 26:15.747
But mostly
Ow.

26:15.747 --> 26:17.751
we want Harper
to feel comfortable

26:17.751 --> 26:20.256
in her own skin.
(groans)

26:20.256 --> 26:21.725
(laughing):
Yes.

26:21.725 --> 26:23.763
Yes.

26:23.763 --> 26:25.299
Fostering a sense of self.

26:25.299 --> 26:26.268
That's precisely why

26:26.268 --> 26:29.307
Kellogg restricts access
to popular culture.

26:29.307 --> 26:31.712
TV, Mama?
Oh...

26:34.751 --> 26:35.486
Is that a...

26:35.486 --> 26:37.724
a television remote?

26:37.724 --> 26:39.227
(chuckles nervously)
I don't know.

26:39.227 --> 26:43.402
She makes so many things
out of clay a‐and plastics.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.038
She's a little genius.
Baby.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.009
She has a laboratory
up in her bedroom.

26:47.009 --> 26:49.080
(Murtaugh and Trish laugh)

26:49.981 --> 26:52.420
Gluten‐free macaroon?

26:57.530 --> 26:59.267
Riggs?

26:59.267 --> 27:00.770
I'm serious, Maureen.

27:00.770 --> 27:02.140
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.209
Okay, well, then
you don't want

27:03.209 --> 27:05.346
to talk about the fact
that all of Jonah's notes

27:05.346 --> 27:07.417
are written on place mats.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.120
From the same diner.

27:12.794 --> 27:14.364
Floyd's.

27:14.364 --> 27:15.933
You hungry?

27:19.274 --> 27:21.512
What can I get you?

27:21.512 --> 27:23.816
Actually... (clears throat)

27:23.816 --> 27:24.951
need you to look at a photo.

27:24.951 --> 27:27.490
You ever seen this guy?

27:27.490 --> 27:29.828
Oh, yeah. You just missed him.

27:29.828 --> 27:31.532
He was here maybe
a minute ago.

27:31.532 --> 27:33.869
I was just about
to bus his table.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.540
(horns honking)

27:35.540 --> 27:37.042
MAN:
Hey, get out of the way!

27:38.077 --> 27:39.815
CAHILL:
Riggs, I think it's a detonator.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.087
(door bells jingle)

27:43.087 --> 27:45.960
Jonah, what do
you have there?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.897
Hey, why don't you
just put that down?

27:47.897 --> 27:50.269
No. I'm gonna... I'm gonna
prove... I'm gonna prove

27:50.269 --> 27:51.205
I'm not crazy.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.143
Watch.

27:55.346 --> 27:57.082
(horns honk, metallic crashing)
(grunts)

27:57.917 --> 27:59.821
JONAH:
I knew it!

27:59.821 --> 28:01.859
I told you,
it does control traffic!

28:01.859 --> 28:03.796
The lights,
they all turned green.

28:03.796 --> 28:04.865
I don't know.

28:04.865 --> 28:06.335
Maybe he's not crazy,
after all.

28:06.335 --> 28:09.541
Let's go.
We got‐we got to stop Elvis!

28:09.541 --> 28:12.012
Okay, maybe just a little bit.

28:17.557 --> 28:19.026
RIGGS:
<i>You're like a new man, Jonah.</i>

28:19.026 --> 28:20.897
Little sleep

28:20.897 --> 28:22.165
and a lot of medication.

28:22.165 --> 28:24.371
Sounds like my kind of night.

28:27.243 --> 28:29.347
Lot of people
been looking for you.

28:29.347 --> 28:31.818
Some crazy theories
on what you've been up to.

28:31.818 --> 28:35.893
I bet. The truth
will sound even crazier.

28:35.893 --> 28:37.830
Well, you're in luck.

28:37.830 --> 28:39.601
I speak crazy.

28:39.601 --> 28:42.440
Okay.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.178
Elvis is controlling traffic.

28:45.178 --> 28:47.215
So you're gonna stick
to that story.

28:47.215 --> 28:49.153
Not <i>the</i> Elvis. <i>An</i> Elvis.

28:49.153 --> 28:51.223
Those guys who pose for photos

28:51.223 --> 28:53.495
on Hollywood Boulevard.
Come on, Jonah.

28:53.495 --> 28:54.931
Hasn't anyone ever told you?

28:54.931 --> 28:56.233
Can't trust a man
in white leather pants.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.941
Look, I saw these guys
dressed as Elvis

28:59.941 --> 29:01.912
c‐climbing up a utility pole,

29:01.912 --> 29:03.282
installing
these trigger switches,

29:03.282 --> 29:05.920
the one that you saw
change the light.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.826
So, I‐I posted a video about it,
and as soon as I did,

29:08.826 --> 29:11.465
those Elvises
started following me everywhere.

29:11.465 --> 29:12.934
I‐I think one of them

29:12.934 --> 29:14.537
came to my apartment
to try to kill me.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.379
Okay. (clears throat)

29:18.379 --> 29:20.349
Let me just make sure
I'm following.

29:20.349 --> 29:24.391
So, Larry
was accidentally killed

29:24.391 --> 29:27.997
because the Elvises
thought that he was you?

29:27.997 --> 29:30.503
That's my theory.

29:30.503 --> 29:31.905
Over some stoplights.

29:31.905 --> 29:33.642
Not the lights.
The traffic.

29:33.642 --> 29:35.880
Think about it.
I mean, thousands of people

29:35.880 --> 29:37.249
trapped
in a tourist destination?

29:37.249 --> 29:40.121
And no way out?

29:40.121 --> 29:41.591
So you weren't planning
an attack.

29:41.591 --> 29:42.894
You were trying to prevent one.

29:42.894 --> 29:45.065
You saw this work.

29:45.065 --> 29:47.269
You know
it isn't all in my head.

29:47.269 --> 29:48.639
(inhales)

29:48.639 --> 29:51.277
It's gonna be tough
getting everyone on board.

29:51.277 --> 29:54.584
I know I don't always
see clearly.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.020
I‐I've made mistakes.

29:56.020 --> 29:58.692
But this is my chance
to make it right.

29:58.692 --> 30:01.197
You got to believe me.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.573
(phone rings)

30:05.573 --> 30:07.944
Hey. How's the love of my life?

30:07.944 --> 30:09.347
TRISH:
She's been better, Roger.

30:09.347 --> 30:13.355
<i>Harper was rejected</i>
<i>from Kellogg.</i>

30:13.355 --> 30:15.960
Damn it. I knew
I should have hid that remote.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.030
No, Dr. Weir said

30:18.030 --> 30:19.400
it wasn't the TV.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.272
She made it abundantly clear
it was you.

30:22.272 --> 30:23.642
Who was that person, baby?

30:23.642 --> 30:26.147
It was the person
whose kid belongs at Kellogg.

30:26.147 --> 30:28.752
No, Roger, Harper belongs
where she's happy.

30:28.752 --> 30:29.754
And that might
have been Kellogg,

30:29.754 --> 30:31.023
but now we'll never know.

30:31.023 --> 30:32.393
(honking)
What is happening?!

30:32.393 --> 30:34.296
Okay, listen,
I'm sorry I screwed up.

30:34.296 --> 30:36.000
But please don't drive angry.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.537
No, honey.
I'm not honking at you.

30:37.537 --> 30:39.741
It's just that Hollywood's
a mess, and this light

30:39.741 --> 30:42.012
has not changed
for five minutes!

30:42.012 --> 30:45.118
Wait, there's something wrong
with the lights in Hollywood?

30:45.118 --> 30:46.688
Yes, and it's terrible timing.

30:46.688 --> 30:47.623
And this mall, it's a zoo.

30:47.623 --> 30:49.794
And why do they call it
Black Friday, huh?

30:49.794 --> 30:52.165
Because it lasts a week.
Okay, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

30:52.165 --> 30:53.769
Hey, Bailey, I need to borrow

30:53.769 --> 30:57.108
that incredibly
paranoid brain of yours.
Okay, if you're ready.

30:57.108 --> 30:59.046
What if Jonah was right
about traffic

30:59.046 --> 31:01.083
but wrong about the bomb?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.152
I'd buy it.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.056
I've been checking the map
and Transpo shows lights

31:04.056 --> 31:05.492
acting up all over Hollywood.

31:05.492 --> 31:08.097
The whole neighborhood
has been gridlocked.

31:08.097 --> 31:09.601
Okay. I never thought
I'd say this,

31:09.601 --> 31:11.771
but we need to put a BOLO out
for Elvis.

31:11.771 --> 31:14.343
Told you he wasn't dead.

31:16.013 --> 31:18.017
(people shouting)

31:18.017 --> 31:20.154
(horns honking)

31:27.335 --> 31:30.609
(horns honking)

31:33.147 --> 31:35.285
(people shouting)

31:39.827 --> 31:43.367
MAN:
<i>Swing a right.</i>

31:48.712 --> 31:50.416
(tires screeching)

31:50.416 --> 31:51.685
(grunts)

31:54.857 --> 31:56.594
Sir!

31:56.594 --> 31:58.364
You okay, sir?

31:58.364 --> 31:59.701
Never better.

31:59.701 --> 32:02.205
Drop it and get the hell out.

32:06.614 --> 32:09.319
(imitates Elvis):
Thank you. Thank you very much.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.705
MAN:
<i>To your right,</i>

32:18.705 --> 32:21.845
you'll see Gary Busey's
go‐to bagel shop. Fun fact.

32:21.845 --> 32:23.815
Gary is a pumpernickel man.

32:23.815 --> 32:26.120
(chuckles) Lightly toasted.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.590
And for all of you
Adam Levine fans,

32:27.590 --> 32:28.825
we got a real big
excitement here.

32:28.825 --> 32:30.829
I'm actually auditioning for...

32:30.829 --> 32:32.132
Uh, hey, sir.

32:32.132 --> 32:33.100
This is a private tour.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.470
These people
paid money to be here.
Oh.

32:34.470 --> 32:35.472
Yeah, don't let me interrupt.

32:35.472 --> 32:36.474
Uh, keep‐keep going.

32:36.474 --> 32:37.777
You're doing a great job.

32:37.777 --> 32:39.480
Okay. Uh...

32:39.480 --> 32:41.785
Martin, how did
you know...

32:41.785 --> 32:44.490
Wait, have you been
following me?

32:45.391 --> 32:47.563
That's awful paranoid.

32:47.563 --> 32:49.801
I tracked your phone.
(chuckles)

32:49.801 --> 32:51.236
Well, if you came
for your change,

32:51.236 --> 32:52.540
you're too late‐‐
I already spent it.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.443
Look, you told me
to come and find you,

32:54.443 --> 32:56.548
or to tell you
when I got the list.

32:56.548 --> 32:58.618
So, I found the list.

32:58.618 --> 33:00.656
Had to do that
in person, huh?

33:00.656 --> 33:03.795
I just don't want things
to be weird between us, okay?

33:03.795 --> 33:05.699
I figured
if you saw the reasons

33:05.699 --> 33:07.402
<i>why</i> we shouldn't date,

33:07.402 --> 33:09.105
it'd make it easier
for you to understand.

33:09.105 --> 33:10.274
Snatch it.

33:10.274 --> 33:12.245
"She keeps the A. C.

33:12.245 --> 33:14.115
at 74."

33:14.115 --> 33:15.451
It's hot. It's hot.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.455
It's not that hot.
It's 74. It's hot.

33:17.455 --> 33:19.527
"Aggressive use
of cumin"?

33:19.527 --> 33:21.463
I do love my cumin.
You love it.

33:21.463 --> 33:23.602
As you can see,
those are valid reasons.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.304
Oh, oh, it's a solid list.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.612
You do realize it's
nowhere near complete, right?

33:28.612 --> 33:30.916
I can think
of, like,

33:30.916 --> 33:33.420
a dozen more reasons why
we shouldn't be together.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.859
Let me find my pen.

33:37.161 --> 33:38.464
Oh. Well, then great.

33:38.464 --> 33:39.901
Good. I'm‐I'm glad
you're on board.

33:39.901 --> 33:42.338
Write down
all that you need to...

33:42.338 --> 33:44.877
(phone ringing)
write down.

33:44.877 --> 33:46.446
Hey, Rog.

33:46.446 --> 33:47.650
Elvis has left the building.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.720
(siren wailing)
I repeat:
Elvis has left the building.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.290
Have you been
day‐drinking without me?

33:51.290 --> 33:52.392
Shut up and listen.

33:52.392 --> 33:54.764
Transpo says that lights are out
all over Hollywood.

33:54.764 --> 33:56.834
Okay? Someone's blocking traffic

33:56.834 --> 33:59.740
trying to keep the cops out,
create an escape route.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.578
Jonah was right‐‐
there <i>is</i> a bomb.

34:01.578 --> 34:05.284
Armored truck,
flush with Black Friday cash,

34:05.284 --> 34:07.522
headed to the bank.
Let me guess. Elvis.

34:07.522 --> 34:09.259
Back from the dead

34:09.259 --> 34:10.194
and strapped.

34:10.194 --> 34:11.864
No one's getting in or out
of Hollywood.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.735
But you're there, right?
Yeah.

34:13.735 --> 34:16.206
Me and a bus
full of German tourists.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.346
And an armored truck
full of Elvises.

34:19.346 --> 34:21.216
Hey.

34:21.216 --> 34:22.653
The list is
gonna have to wait.

34:22.653 --> 34:24.924
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
uh, I have just found out

34:24.924 --> 34:28.297
that Tom Cruise is
inside this dumpling house!

34:28.297 --> 34:30.636
Great photo op!
Get your cameras,
guys. Go, Molly.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.240
RIGGS: Maverick!
Yes, sir, Cole Trickle!

34:33.240 --> 34:35.211
All right, all right, people,
off the bus!

34:35.211 --> 34:36.948
That's it. Yep, yep.
Thank you so much.

34:36.948 --> 34:39.252
All clear back there.
All right.

34:39.252 --> 34:40.656
I'm gonna have to take
this, if you won't mind.

34:40.656 --> 34:43.628
Yep, yep, I'm a, uh,
industry professional.

34:43.628 --> 34:45.531
All right, you'll
get it back. Maybe.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.872
You, too, princess.
Oh, no,

34:48.872 --> 34:51.611
I know exactly what I'm
getting into, and I'm staying.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.682
You made a list of reasons
why we shouldn't date.

34:53.682 --> 34:56.253
Well, I got reasons, too.
You're gonna hear 'em.

34:56.253 --> 34:58.590
Burning time, Detective.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.528
You know, I forget how
stubborn you are sometimes.

35:00.528 --> 35:02.398
Ooh. Well, you should've
added that to this list.

35:02.398 --> 35:04.637
Hang on.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.645
(horns honking)

35:08.645 --> 35:10.347
MOLLY:
<i>All right!</i>

35:10.347 --> 35:11.550
Number one‐‐

35:11.550 --> 35:13.420
I've always beat you
at <i>Mario Kart,</i>

35:13.420 --> 35:14.690
which drives you crazy.

35:14.690 --> 35:17.361
Number two‐‐ I know
what you look like
under that mustache,

35:17.361 --> 35:19.900
which, frankly,
I'm still trying to get used to.

35:19.900 --> 35:20.902
But the big one,

35:20.902 --> 35:24.609
the real reason why we
shouldn't be together?

35:24.609 --> 35:25.846
This is scary as hell.

35:25.846 --> 35:27.750
Yeah. <i>I'm</i> scared.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.687
And I know you're
scared, too.

35:29.687 --> 35:31.423
I remember what
that looks like.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.960
But that's good.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.297
It means we've got
something to lose.

35:38.705 --> 35:40.642
(siren wailing, tires squealing)

35:41.644 --> 35:43.614
MOLLY:
<i>All right.</i>

35:43.614 --> 35:46.419
So, when we catch
them, what do we do?

35:46.419 --> 35:47.723
What's the plan?

35:47.723 --> 35:48.992
Uh, usually, these things

35:48.992 --> 35:50.695
kind of just
work themselves out,

35:50.695 --> 35:52.900
you know.
(laughs): You... you
haven't changed a bit.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.770
You know that?
Give me the wheel.

35:54.770 --> 35:56.874
Not a chance.
You need help,

35:56.874 --> 35:59.045
and I've always been
a better driver than you anyway.

35:59.045 --> 36:00.548
(laughs)

36:00.548 --> 36:01.784
(mock laugh)

36:02.920 --> 36:04.924
All right, look,
stay in their blind spot

36:04.924 --> 36:06.626
and ride the brakes.

Dr. Weir!

Oh. Funny running into you.

38:37.094 --> 38:40.000
If this is about your daughter's
admission, Mr. Murtaugh,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.104
I'm sorry‐‐
all decisions are final.

38:42.104 --> 38:43.673
Yes, we got the e‐mail.

38:43.673 --> 38:47.081
While I have you,
I do have one question.

38:47.081 --> 38:50.621
Have you seen
any good movies lately?

38:51.689 --> 38:52.725
Movies? No.

38:52.725 --> 38:55.531
You know Kellogg's policy
on popular culture.

38:55.531 --> 38:59.005
Shame. I just saw
a terrific film.

38:59.005 --> 39:03.680
All captured...
on a dash camera

39:03.680 --> 39:05.919
of a squad car.

39:05.919 --> 39:09.125
Oh.
You can make out
movie posters,

39:09.125 --> 39:12.097
candy brands, even faces.

39:12.097 --> 39:14.835
You know who
would enjoy this?

39:14.835 --> 39:16.874
(whispers):
The headmaster.

39:18.009 --> 39:19.745
Come to think of it,

39:19.745 --> 39:21.951
there may have been

39:21.951 --> 39:23.520
a... typo

39:23.520 --> 39:25.090
in that e‐mail.
