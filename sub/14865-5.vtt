WEBVTT

02:45.041 --> 02:46.997
All right, boys.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.540
Let's eat.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.720
Be there soon.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.859
I've been thinking.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.862
If you don't want to, you don't need
to go back to the oollegium.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.613
Antony's orders
don't stand now, do they?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.537
The orders haven't been rescinded.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.751
There's naught there
but thieves and out—throats.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.620
It's no life for children.

03:34.757 --> 03:35.997
Then where?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.419
Where can they find
respect and dignity now?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.385
Where can they live
without contempt?

03:42.014 --> 03:44.255
Take 'em anyplace but there.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.099
Go far away.
Who's to know?

03:47.228 --> 03:48.092
Lie, you mean?

03:48.229 --> 03:50.390
Live dishonestly?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.434
Well, there's lies
and there's lies, innit?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.607
This way.
That's it, come on.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.360
What's this, then?

04:05.579 --> 04:08.195
Put it right here.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.668
By whose authority
do you block the road?

04:14.797 --> 04:17.664
By authority
of Gaius Octavian Caesar.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.212
Go hold your horse.
We'll get to you.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.462
Sister!

04:34.650 --> 04:36.606
Not yet.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.226
We can't run off without any money.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.153
Octavian has brought
his army to Rome?

04:45.286 --> 04:49.074
Put up camp yesterday
on the field of Mars — 15,000 men.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.328
Your boy's a bit
aggressive, isn't he?

04:57.465 --> 05:00.172
My boy gave
your man a whipping.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.508
Expect he knows what he's doing.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.720
My dear boy.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.979
You are a hero of the Republic.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.900
Caesar himself could not
have conjured a finer victory.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.020
I am Caesar himself...

05:22.156 --> 05:23.316
technically speaking.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.690
lndeed.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.363
On behalf of the Senate,

05:28.496 --> 05:31.203
we are deeply thankful.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.199
Not quite thankful enough
to give me the triumph | asked for?

05:34.335 --> 05:36.826
Now there,
I'm doing you a favour.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.375
Mutina was a lovely victory,
it's true.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.624
But it was a victory over other Romans,

05:42.760 --> 05:44.546
and with all respect,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.088
Hirtius and Pansa...

05:46.222 --> 05:49.180
Hirtius and Pansa are dead.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.259
May the gods feed them honey.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.515
They are dead.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.433
But it is well known that
actual command of the battle

06:00.569 --> 06:01.979
was in their hands.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.603
The purpose of a battle
is to remain alive.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.901
They did not. I did.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.695
lndeed.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.570
Even so, the victory
is not quite complete.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.331
Mark Antony still lives.
He still has men.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.453
We have had to send
Marcus Lepidus and two legions north.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.251
Lepidus?
Sending your very best, then?

06:23.384 --> 06:26.876
l have every confidence
that Lepidus will succeed.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.424
Then he may have a triumph too
if he wants one.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.970
The people would not
look kindly on a triumph.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.469
Not with your army
at the walls of the city.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.766
A little unsavoury, perhaps.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.140
Now there, there he has a point.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.395
How good of you to say so.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.526
l bend to your wise counsel, then.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.865
- No triumph.
— We shall find some fitting way

06:58.002 --> 06:59.788
to celebrate your glory.

07:01.213 --> 07:06.003
Perhaps a temple to Caesar victorious.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.468
— That sounds rather fine, doesn't it?
- If I cannot have a triumph,

07:09.597 --> 07:12.430
l was rather thinking
of taking the Consul's chair.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.424
You wish to be consul?

07:16.437 --> 07:18.473
It's a vanity, I know.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.313
But I think I deserve it,
and it would please my men.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.482
You're 19.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.853
You're too young to be a senator,
leave alone consul.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.447
My dear boy,
you've been listening to bad advice.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.864
You have no experience.
You have no connections.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.452
He has an army.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.498
Well...

07:44.548 --> 07:46.539
l'll speak with the other senators.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.841
We'll see if it's possible.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.632
Though if you were to be consul...

07:54.600 --> 07:57.342
you must promise
to be guided by my counsel.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.810
It is an office of high complexity.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.680
And I am well aware
of my inexperience.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.558
I will not utter a word
without your advice, your...

08:05.694 --> 08:07.195
consent

08:09.156 --> 08:10.521
Well...

08:11.825 --> 08:14.567
perhaps something can be done.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.991
Bumptious young fool.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.209
The consul's chair indeed.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.748
Yes, but you will give it to him?

08:25.881 --> 08:28.167
Why not soothe his vanity?
He can do no harm.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.416
He will wear the purple
as he wears armour,

08:30.552 --> 08:33.510
like a child playing at grown—ups.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.630
Come, Tyro.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.224
I'm leaving now.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.844
Are you sure you won't come with me?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.265
Busy.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.310
Mother.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.773
He will come to me.

08:46.902 --> 08:50.315
Make the first gesture
and you will have the moral high ground.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.063
I gave birth to the ingrate.
He will come to me.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.784
— You're delusional. He's not coming.
- Thank you, daughter.

08:56.912 --> 09:01.406
I really appreciate these little chats
we have in between your drug binges.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.954
I'll be going, then.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.584
Should I give him your love?

09:11.343 --> 09:13.004
What should I tell him?

09:16.557 --> 09:21.017
Tell him that he's still got all our money
and we want it back.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.431
All right, the blue.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.350
Does it come in linen?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.688
Blow on it for luck.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.473
These are my daughters
redeemed from slavery.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.555
The eldest has been prostituted,

10:00.684 --> 10:03.141
the boy is my wife's child
by another man.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.852
You will treat them with respect

10:05.981 --> 10:07.721
and kindness.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.773
Or I will know the reason why.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.957
Gets a good breeze from the river.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.086
We'll have it swept...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.881
and painted.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.089
You like it?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.554
Yes, Father.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.180
We're all of us
starting again together.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.352
There will be...

10:51.485 --> 10:53.851
awkwardness at first, no doubt.

10:54.363 --> 10:58.276
But we're a family
and we'll be together.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.783
As it should be.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.488
We will not speak of the past.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.909
Yes, Father.

11:23.559 --> 11:27.017
Still eating like a horse, I see.
I don't know how you stay so skinny.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.976
How dare you?

11:29.106 --> 11:32.815
I'm not skinny.
l'm slender maybe.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.441
You're skinny.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.859
— I wonder how you don't blow away.
- My armour holds me down.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.361
Mother sends her love.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.160
— Does she?
— She does.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.954
She would have come with me, only...

11:51.086 --> 11:53.543
she has this silly idea
that you should come to her.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.584
— She'll grow old alone, then.
- I know how you feel,

11:56.717 --> 11:58.548
but really and truly,

11:58.677 --> 12:01.635
what would it hurt
to let her have her way?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.014
She is your mother.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.973
Octavia, you were there.
You know what kind of a mother she is.

12:06.101 --> 12:10.265
The gods know I have reason
to hate as much as you do.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.388
More maybe.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.565
But where does that lead you?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.605
Who can you love
if not your own mother?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.603
She put her lover to beating me.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.777
You credit her with too much power.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.743
Antony has a hold on her.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.953
She's scared and lonely without him.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.197
She made a mistake.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.201
I should have thought you at least
would be on my side.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.212
Brother, please!

12:37.591 --> 12:41.004
Don't be like that.
There are no sides.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.219
I love you. She loves you.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.760
You can't turn your back on family.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.343
She put her lover to beating me.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.430
Her sweat was on him.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.142
So they had made love. So?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.984
They are lovers.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.946
Don't be so damn pious.

13:03.075 --> 13:06.738
You'd just thrown the family
into ruinous debt.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.735
For this!

13:08.872 --> 13:10.988
So you can play at soldiers.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.084
l might've beat you myself!

13:13.210 --> 13:15.747
Clearly there's no point
in further discussion, then.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.292
Please, don't be angry.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.882
Come home.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.259
Come home.

13:29.851 --> 13:34.060
I don't intend to enter the city until
the Senate has ratified me as Consul.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.975
I shall then live at Caesar's villa.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.520
If Mother wishes to visit me there,
no one will stop her.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.392
Consul?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.025
Why would you invite such trouble?

13:47.202 --> 13:50.535
But in public you will speak of me
only with the utmost respect.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.653
Is that clear?

13:51.790 --> 13:54.327
I would never say
anything against you.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.833
You're my brother.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.160
Thank you for visiting, sister.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.834
We'll see each other again soon...

14:01.967 --> 14:03.832
when I'm less busy.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.684
What a stupid arse you've become!

14:23.739 --> 14:25.730
We've been hard—pressed since you left.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.152
Shields up, leathers braced.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.025
We've done well to hold our ground.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.902
I hope I've done right by you.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.121
You've done well, l have no doubt.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.912
- Thank you.
— We go on as before.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.785
Pullo's second, you're third.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.465
Third?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.255
Whatever you say, chief.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.720
But I was thinking I'd be second.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.433
Not now, woman! Can't you see
we're talking business?

14:59.483 --> 15:00.939
Anything else you'd like?

15:01.068 --> 15:02.899
See if the children want anything.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.106
Will do, boss.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.944
Being captain
all these long months,

15:13.080 --> 15:14.911
it's only justice, isn't it?

15:15.582 --> 15:19.245
If it's justice you're after, brother,
you're in the wrong place.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.538
Pullo is second. You are third.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.923
I die, Pullo dies,

15:24.049 --> 15:26.165
you move up.
That's how it works.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.046
I'll bet you 50 golden drachmae

15:29.179 --> 15:31.170
it's not me that goes first.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.452
Lucius Vorenus.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.032
Raise your head, Lyde.
I'm harmless enough.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.378
You're in a temple now?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.131
The altar of blessed Orbona.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.929
Good.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.640
— And you're well?
- I am.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.186
The children...

16:22.315 --> 16:23.896
are they all right?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.435
They're well enough.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.776
Listen.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.413
Don't think you can take them away.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.373
They're staying with me.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.381
Lyde!

16:58.518 --> 17:02.887
My loves! My loves!
My loves! My loves!

17:04.983 --> 17:07.645
Praise the great goddess,
you are returned.

17:10.572 --> 17:13.530
Blessed Orbona,
I will fulfil my vow.

17:23.710 --> 17:28.044
Praise her goodness.
Praise her goodness.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.710
Praise her goodness.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.731
Come to bed, love.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.111
What's wrong, princess?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.232
Why are you crying?

17:58.245 --> 17:59.360
Tell me.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.700
It's something I've done, I expect.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.832
Why do you leave me
with these bad people?

18:09.965 --> 18:12.627
They treated you all right, didn't they?

18:13.677 --> 18:16.089
Name the one
that didn't treat you right

18:16.221 --> 18:18.678
— and I'll see to it.
— It's not the point.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.469
Why do you leave me here
for Vorenus?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.512
He needed my help.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.557
I couldn't let it lie. The children.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.182
Vorenus...

18:30.318 --> 18:31.979
him you love.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.318
Me, no.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.108
No.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.240
You, yes.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.122
He more.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.738
No.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.283
No question.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.503
If both of you were
drowning in the river,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.498
l'd save you first.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.465
No question.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.887
Swear?

19:02.851 --> 19:05.012
I swear.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.511
You're half his weight.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.353
Half?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.473
Half his weight.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.685
Not so heavy. Easier to save.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.482
Never mind.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.553
Mother.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.297
It's so good to see you.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.738
My son.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.404
My son...

20:03.536 --> 20:05.697
forgive me.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.953
Forgive me.
I've been wicked and cruel.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.166
Beat me, kill me.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.581
Do what you want,
but just please...

20:14.714 --> 20:17.751
— please forgive me.
— Mother, please...

20:17.884 --> 20:21.217
I spit on that pig Antony
for leading me astray.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.429
I've been a terrible mother,
but I can change.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.219
And I will change
if you just give me a chance.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.186
My darling only son.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.476
Gods be my witness...

20:35.568 --> 20:37.729
I am so sorry.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.400
I'm so sorry.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.493
I forgive you.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.908
Thank you.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.882
Thank you.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.728
Look who's here, daughter.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.399
Our beloved Octavian
has blessed us with his forgiveness.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.997
Welcome home, brother.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.847
Father Janus,

21:49.976 --> 21:53.184
| ask you to cleanse these children

21:53.313 --> 21:56.055
of the dark spirits
that have fouled them.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.299
I thank you for bringing
my family back to me.

22:34.729 --> 22:38.472
I swear to you
that from this day

22:38.608 --> 22:39.893
l renounce darkness

22:40.026 --> 22:42.813
and I will walk in the path of light.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.870
Right, left, right!

23:11.474 --> 23:12.759
Lepidus...

23:17.730 --> 23:19.641
My old friend.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.516
How are you?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.234
I've seen better days.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.941
Off you go, boys.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.656
I don't think General Lepidus has any...

23:30.785 --> 23:33.447
ill designs on me.
Do you?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.655
Not under present circumstances.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.742
Come on.

23:42.046 --> 23:45.584
My men deserted to your side
with amazing alacrity.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.422
Not a single blow struck,
yet my camp is empty.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.883
Amazing.

23:53.016 --> 23:57.100
Yes, I really must write
to Cicero and the Senate.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.970
It was remarkably
generous of them to give me

24:00.106 --> 24:01.846
so many fresh troops.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.974
I confess I had no idea

24:04.110 --> 24:06.396
how popular you are
with the rank and file.

24:07.614 --> 24:11.357
Soldiers like a little spit and dirt
in their leaders.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.575
You were too noble
for them, perhaps.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.616
Too aristocratic.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.832
That may be so.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.500
So...

24:26.633 --> 24:29.249
what to do now?

24:30.303 --> 24:33.261
Strictly speaking, of course,

24:33.389 --> 24:35.641
I should kill you.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.561
I really don't wish to be punitive.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.021
But on the other hand,
I can't really let you go either.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.438
So...what to do?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.231
What to do?

24:53.993 --> 24:57.702
Would you be willing to act
as my second in command?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.327
Dear me.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.666
That's very generous of you.

25:11.636 --> 25:12.876
Yes or no?

25:13.513 --> 25:15.424
Well, |...

25:15.556 --> 25:19.048
I can't really say no, can I?

25:19.560 --> 25:22.848
No, you can't.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.565
I swear to you, four nipples.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.773
How is married life, Pullo?

25:31.906 --> 25:33.988
Well enough. Women, eh?

25:34.659 --> 25:38.026
It's a strange, awkward arrangement
to be thrust up and...

25:38.162 --> 25:40.027
bound against another so.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.075
But it seems to be the natural state
of man and woman.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.915
— It must be right and good.
- No doubt.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.750
Listen to me,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.835
a lamb lecturing a lion.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.085
Any plans to wed, then?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.459
I'm thinking about it.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.930
So Vorenus and his family
are back in Rome?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.559
Yes.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.347
My friend asks you to understand

26:03.479 --> 26:06.721
that he remains under loyal oath
to the man up north.

26:06.858 --> 26:09.224
But he will do what's best for the city.

26:10.695 --> 26:14.813
He acknowledges that you're
legal custodian of the Republic

26:14.949 --> 26:17.281
and will keep the peace
the same as before.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.492
Tell your friend I'm grateful,

26:19.620 --> 26:22.783
but I hear there is a deal of violence
again between the collegia.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.451
No trouble.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.121
We may need to bang
a few heads together.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.120
- Maybe.
— Whatever needs to be done.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.837
A period of calm is essential.

26:35.428 --> 26:40.422
We understand, but my friend
won't answer for the future.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.559
If him up north were to come
back with full armour on...

26:46.564 --> 26:48.771
We shall hope for the best.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.977
Well done, by the way...

26:55.656 --> 26:56.816
all this.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.990
Thank you, Pullo.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.954
What an auspicious day.

27:14.801 --> 27:18.168
Many gave their lives
that we might stand here once again

27:18.304 --> 27:22.798
united in the government
of a lawful republic.

27:31.776 --> 27:35.439
And how fitting
that we welcome this new beginning

27:35.571 --> 27:40.190
by swearing in
the youngest consul

27:40.326 --> 27:42.612
in the history of Rome.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.449
Gaius Octavian...

27:46.582 --> 27:48.368
Caesar.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.176
Esteemed senators...

28:10.147 --> 28:14.265
I take this first moment before you
not to glorify myself,

28:14.402 --> 28:16.393
but to honour my father.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.070
In his honour I declare
that my term as Consul

28:20.199 --> 28:22.235
shall usher in a new era.

28:22.368 --> 28:26.077
An era of moral virtue,

28:26.205 --> 28:27.661
of dignity.

28:28.666 --> 28:33.251
The debauchery and chaos
we have had to endure will now end.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.244
Rome shall be again

28:35.381 --> 28:37.463
as she once was —

28:37.592 --> 28:40.299
a proud republic of virtuous women

28:40.428 --> 28:42.635
and honest men.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.808
I speak to you now

28:49.937 --> 28:51.598
not as a soldier

28:51.731 --> 28:53.722
or citizen,

28:53.858 --> 28:55.894
but as a grieving son.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.810
As my first act
in this reborn republic,

28:59.947 --> 29:03.781
and in honour of my father,
I propose a motion...

29:03.910 --> 29:09.405
to declare Brutus and Cassius
murderers

29:09.540 --> 29:11.747
and enemies of the state.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.749
Outrageous!

29:27.600 --> 29:30.012
My dear boy,
this is not what we agreed.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.760
It is not.
Nevertheless, here we are.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.637
Brutus and Cassius
still have many friends.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.141
You will split the chamber,
the unity of the Republic!

29:38.277 --> 29:40.359
Step away from my chair.

30:01.342 --> 30:03.958
My father died on this floor.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.805
Right there.

30:08.766 --> 30:12.179
Stabbed 27 times. Butchered...

30:12.311 --> 30:14.518
by men he called his friends.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.814
Who will tell me that is not murder?

30:18.943 --> 30:22.151
Who will tell my legions,
who love Caesar as I do,

30:22.279 --> 30:24.065
that that is not murder?

30:35.918 --> 30:38.705
Who will speak against the motion?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.219
Some willow tea, perhaps?

30:53.728 --> 30:55.389
Henbane, more like.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.556
I've been outmanoeuvred by a child.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.774
To the country, then.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.645
Some fresh air and sleep
will do you good.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.861
Take a letter.

31:14.123 --> 31:17.411
"To Marcus Junius Brutus
and Gaius Cassius Longinus..."

31:18.461 --> 31:22.329
Dominus, if Octavian hears that
you're in communication with Brutus...

31:22.465 --> 31:24.456
Don't talk.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.253
Write.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.757
"Heroes of the Republic,

31:33.184 --> 31:34.640
"greetings..."

32:22.274 --> 32:24.139
Children.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.441
Father.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.312
Are you all well?

32:31.492 --> 32:32.948
We are.

32:40.835 --> 32:43.121
Broken, is it?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.792
No problem.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.627
No trouble.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.264
|'|| fix it.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.892
Yeah, easy mend.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.056
I've been very busy
since we've been back,

33:02.189 --> 33:05.101
we've not spent
enough time together...

33:05.985 --> 33:09.022
I thought maybe
sometime soon we could...

33:09.155 --> 33:10.770
spend the day together.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.780
In the country.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.578
Would you like that?

33:24.545 --> 33:26.331
If you like.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.295
Good. Good.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.667
We'll do that.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.133
We'll do that.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.906
Want anything from the kitchen
before I lock up?

34:00.039 --> 34:01.370
No.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.878
It's good to have you back.

34:14.345 --> 34:15.551
Ever seen a real one?

34:17.139 --> 34:18.970
— What's that?
— An elephant.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.095
Yes. A few.

34:23.604 --> 34:25.094
Are they as big as they say?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.067
They're big.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.693
No.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.741
No wheels.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.531
You can have me, if you like.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.127
Or I can go.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.211
Stay.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.970
You can go now.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.719
Go?

35:49.898 --> 35:52.810
There's some coin
on the table. Take half.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.939
Fuck you.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.192
You haven't seen
how much is there yet.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.440
I'm not a whore.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.318
No? Then why are you here?

36:04.872 --> 36:06.282
I thought you liked me.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.829
And you like me too, I suppose?

36:12.296 --> 36:14.002
Something like that.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.209
What a happy couple we'd make.
Take the money.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.424
Fuck you.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.187
I told you.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.099
I'm not a whore.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.686
Take the money.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.531
Maecenas, I'm going.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.532
— What?
— I'm going.

37:30.374 --> 37:31.830
Already?

37:31.959 --> 37:33.449
I'm tired.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.122
No, no, no, no. Stay.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.418
It gets so much better.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.802
We are seconds to the Consul now.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.637
We should not be in such places.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.347
Don't be so fucking pious.

37:49.476 --> 37:52.559
What's the point of being seconds
to the Consul if you can't have some fun?

37:52.688 --> 37:53.973
What?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.479
Never mind. Go if you like.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.519
I can't hear you.

37:58.652 --> 37:59.937
Go if you like.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.361
I'm going.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.350
I say...

38:34.480 --> 38:36.562
are the walls melting?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.317
I don't think so.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.070
They are, you know.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.824
They are melting.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.450
We should all die.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.869
Octavia?

39:12.017 --> 39:15.180
Have her washed and put to bed
as quietly as possible.

39:15.312 --> 39:16.392
Wait.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.902
Good evening, madam.
You'll excuse me if I hurry away.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.569
Exactly what are you doing with
my daughter in the middle of the night?

39:30.577 --> 39:32.863
He abducted me.

39:37.543 --> 39:42.378
I was at a perfectly nice party
with Jocasta,

39:42.506 --> 39:46.966
and this impud...
impudent brute abducted me.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.755
And brought you home to Mother.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.753
That's a strange abduction.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.721
Where was she?

39:53.850 --> 39:56.307
Octavia, you had best
tell her the truth.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.767
Where were you?

40:04.111 --> 40:06.727
I was at an orgy, Mother.
It was an orgy.

40:06.863 --> 40:10.151
Early stages.
Early stages of an orgy.

40:10.284 --> 40:12.445
The Bacchic rituals
had not yet begun.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.945
— You stupid drunken slut.
— Really, there's no need for...

40:16.081 --> 40:19.073
It's that bitch Jocasta's fault.
She's the one that's led you astray.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.165
So I was at an orgy.
Who cares?

40:21.295 --> 40:23.536
What do you think your brother will do
if he finds out?

40:23.672 --> 40:26.038
I pull a hair for what my brother will do.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.835
Oh, really?

40:27.968 --> 40:31.131
Whilst he's at the Forum
preaching piety and virtue to the plebs,

40:31.263 --> 40:34.050
you're sucking slave cock at an orgy.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.922
How do you think that looks?

40:36.852 --> 40:39.719
— He'll banish you, at the very least.
- No, he won't.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.346
And I sucked no slave cock.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.143
It hadn't got to that part.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.641
Banished. Gone.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.984
And me with you,
to some filthy Greek island.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.775
Don't you dare say a word
to anyone about this.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.068
Never. Of course.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.113
What do you mean, "Of course"?

40:57.247 --> 41:00.455
Why wouldn't you run and tell
your lord and master?

41:02.794 --> 41:04.955
Because...| wouldn't.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.670
Why not? Tell me.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.385
Because...

41:17.476 --> 41:18.591
Because I love her.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.436
You only say that

41:26.568 --> 41:27.978
because you don't know me.

41:28.111 --> 41:32.229
No. No, I know you very well.

41:32.366 --> 41:34.357
You are kind

41:34.493 --> 41:36.404
and full—hearted

41:36.536 --> 41:38.117
and beautiful.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.955
And I would tear down the sky for you
if you asked me to.

41:42.084 --> 41:43.324
Well...

41:49.841 --> 41:53.049
If you ever speak to her again like that
in my presence,

41:53.178 --> 41:54.964
Ishall...

41:56.223 --> 41:58.680
I shall be very angry.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.656
— Brother, what's afoot?
— Letter from Cicero.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.522
The boy Octavian
has forced the Senate

42:15.659 --> 42:18.776
to declare us murderers
and enemies of the Republic.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.073
Well, that's an outrage.
That's a crime.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.288
No, it's a terrible blunder.

42:23.417 --> 42:27.126
Look, Octavian was set fair to unite
both Senate and people behind him.

42:27.254 --> 42:31.088
Now the Senate fears
they have created another tyrant.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.002
Cicero begs us to return
as soon as we can

42:33.135 --> 42:35.877
and begs us to save the Republic.

42:36.555 --> 42:37.715
Scnbe!

42:38.432 --> 42:41.014
So Octavian has only
the four legions, no?

42:41.143 --> 42:43.555
Antony, seven.
That's the beauty of it.

42:43.687 --> 42:45.928
Look, Antony and Octavian
hate each other

42:46.064 --> 42:47.304
far more than they hate us.

42:47.441 --> 42:49.477
Soon enough they must
fight for supremacy.

42:49.609 --> 42:52.021
We need only wait,
mop up the survivors.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.819
Scnbe!

42:59.619 --> 43:01.951
Now this, this is what we've been waiting for.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.866
There you are. Take a letter.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.078
"To Cicero..."

43:30.275 --> 43:31.890
Bacchus.

43:39.451 --> 43:41.282
So, you're back.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.663
Find your children?

43:49.795 --> 43:52.537
- I did.
— They were slaves, I hear.

43:57.636 --> 43:58.796
They were.

43:59.721 --> 44:03.009
I'm happy for you.
Nothing more important than family.

44:03.141 --> 44:06.008
That's true.
That's why I've come to see you.

44:06.144 --> 44:09.807
I don't want my children to live in fear.
I want us to make peace.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.101
Peace?

44:16.238 --> 44:17.398
The new Consul demands it.

44:17.531 --> 44:20.989
- Spoke to him, did you?
— He and Pullo are old friends.

44:22.244 --> 44:23.859
What do you mean, "bah"?

44:23.995 --> 44:25.201
It's all right, brother.

44:25.330 --> 44:27.537
Cotta here means no offence,
do you, Cotta?

44:31.294 --> 44:34.377
This bloodshed, it's bad for business,
it's bad for the city.

44:34.506 --> 44:35.871
Bloodshed started by you.

44:36.633 --> 44:39.215
I won't deny it, I was...

44:39.344 --> 44:42.086
angry, but now I'm calm.

44:42.222 --> 44:45.510
I can see clear, I can see
that we've all suffered enough.

44:45.642 --> 44:48.179
— You, Memmio, how many men you lost?
- A few.

44:49.437 --> 44:50.893
You, Cotta, how many?

44:51.022 --> 44:52.523
Not as many as you.

44:54.276 --> 44:55.482
All good men,

44:55.610 --> 44:57.726
wives and children gone,
and for what?

44:57.863 --> 45:00.229
All we've given
is strength to our enemies.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.526
With peace amongst us three,

45:02.659 --> 45:04.274
Acerbo and the lower collegia

45:04.411 --> 45:06.823
will have to kiss our feet
as they once did.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.414
What terms do you suggest?

45:15.547 --> 45:17.583
Your two collegia
will have the Argosy docks.

45:17.716 --> 45:19.877
You can divide them
between you as you wish.

45:20.010 --> 45:22.752
— We keep the Ostians.
— The Ostians want to come with us.

45:22.888 --> 45:25.755
Nevertheless,
they stay with the Aventine.

45:25.891 --> 45:29.725
But you can have a taste.
Let's say...

45:29.853 --> 45:31.593
five per cent.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.741
If that'll make you happy.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.289
Peace, then.

46:01.051 --> 46:02.962
— They'll think we've gone soft.
— Let them.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.176
We need time to regain our strength.

46:05.305 --> 46:07.637
While they're fighting over
the spoils of the Argosy,

46:07.766 --> 46:11.099
we'll be recruiting men
and restoring order.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.436
He's gone soft.

46:16.691 --> 46:19.273
Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.978
About the Argosy, then.

46:24.199 --> 46:26.531
We'll split half and half.

46:27.786 --> 46:30.118
Bollocks we will.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.962
Careful! Come on, you can do it.

46:56.982 --> 46:58.313
The children!

47:00.902 --> 47:03.268
— What are you doing here?
- We've run away.

47:03.405 --> 47:06.272
Run away? Why?

47:06.408 --> 47:08.694
We can't stay with that evil man.

47:11.037 --> 47:13.494
— Children, come along.
- He is your father.

47:13.623 --> 47:15.534
He killed Mama.

47:15.667 --> 47:19.660
— He cursed us to slavery and disgrace.
— I understand it's a hard thing to bear,

47:19.796 --> 47:22.503
— but it is as it must be.
— I hate him.

47:22.632 --> 47:26.545
And for hatred you lead your brother
and sister unprotected into the street?

47:26.678 --> 47:29.135
I will take care of them.
We've got enough money.

47:29.264 --> 47:33.052
The first thief that crosses your path
will have that, and then what?

47:33.184 --> 47:35.516
You're alone in the world.
How will you live?

47:35.645 --> 47:36.805
By stealing?

47:36.938 --> 47:38.678
By whoring?

47:39.649 --> 47:41.025
If I have to.

47:41.693 --> 47:42.728
And your sister?

47:42.861 --> 47:46.445
When she turns woman,
shall she be a whore also?

47:46.573 --> 47:48.438
Your brother a catamite?

47:52.662 --> 47:55.199
Where will you run

47:55.331 --> 47:57.413
that Vorenus will not find you?

47:57.542 --> 47:59.533
You're all he has left.

48:00.503 --> 48:03.040
He'll not rest until he has you back.

48:04.716 --> 48:07.458
You must stay with your father.

48:07.594 --> 48:09.459
And while you live under his roof

48:09.596 --> 48:13.464
you may carry your hatred
like a stone inside you,

48:13.600 --> 48:16.137
but you mustn't ever let him see it.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.884
Eveh

48:19.814 --> 48:22.681
You must be an obedient daughter.

48:22.817 --> 48:26.435
Knee! to him.
Tell him you love him.

48:30.116 --> 48:33.904
Believe me, this is your only chance.

48:34.037 --> 48:35.618
Their only chance.

48:37.415 --> 48:40.202
It's what your mother would have wanted.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.127
— He will know I'm lying.
- No.

48:44.255 --> 48:48.965
Your love and forgiveness
is all he wants.

48:49.094 --> 48:52.177
He will thank the gods for redeeming him.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.518
Would you care for a glass of wine?

49:04.651 --> 49:07.267
Thank you, no. This is not a social call.

49:09.030 --> 49:11.316
I will not prevaricate.

49:11.449 --> 49:14.065
As leader of the Senate, I must ask...

49:14.202 --> 49:17.319
Rather, I must formally demand

49:17.455 --> 49:19.662
that you surrender command
of your legions.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.622
You are speaking to a consul of Rome.

49:22.418 --> 49:25.581
Give up my army?
And why would I do that?

49:25.713 --> 49:27.749
The Senate feels that
you have used your legions

49:27.882 --> 49:31.625
in a coercive manner against them.
They're inclined to resent it.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.510
I'm sorry they feel so.

49:34.639 --> 49:38.052
But with all respect,
their resentment has no teeth.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.300
What will happen
if I do not do as they say?

49:40.436 --> 49:43.519
Perhaps they will throw
their sandals at you.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.513
Word comes from the east —

49:45.650 --> 49:48.141
Brutus and Cassius are returning to us.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.853
They bring with them...

49:51.990 --> 49:54.276
20 legions.

49:54.993 --> 49:57.200
How many legions do you have?

49:58.246 --> 50:00.658
Four, is it?

50:00.790 --> 50:03.202
I have no notion
of their intentions, of course,

50:03.334 --> 50:05.245
but I suspect they're displeased

50:05.378 --> 50:08.495
to be named murderers
and enemies of the state.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.623
They were named so because they are so.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.750
Be that as it may,

50:15.180 --> 50:16.966
if you were to disarm yourself,

50:17.098 --> 50:20.431
I might persuade Brutus
to treat you Ieniently,

50:20.560 --> 50:23.176
on account of your youth

50:24.022 --> 50:26.104
andinexpenence.

50:26.232 --> 50:28.848
Let us not contemplate the alternative.

50:33.031 --> 50:36.364
A war between you and Brutus
would be short...

50:37.660 --> 50:39.446
and bloody...

50:41.789 --> 50:44.826
and not to your advantage.

51:00.225 --> 51:01.556
20 legions?

51:01.684 --> 51:04.221
He exaggerates the number, I expect.

51:05.980 --> 51:09.268
Half that number would be enough
to crush the men we have.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.265
It will be some months before they arrive.

51:11.402 --> 51:14.394
We could raise more legions
in the meantime.

51:17.492 --> 51:22.361
Fresh men, untrained.
They'd only be so many mouths to feed.

51:22.497 --> 51:24.783
So, what's to be done, then?

51:24.916 --> 51:26.497
I don't know.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.038
I don't know.

51:34.968 --> 51:36.754
Hello, boys.

51:41.266 --> 51:43.848
Why so glum? Has someone died?

51:49.899 --> 51:52.766
"Brutus, my dear son.

51:53.820 --> 51:56.732
"I hear today that you're returning to us.

51:56.864 --> 52:01.654
"I give thanks to the gods
and pray for your success.

52:01.786 --> 52:04.152
"I enclose your father's ring

52:04.289 --> 52:06.655
"that his father gave him.

52:20.471 --> 52:21.677
"He always used to say

52:21.806 --> 52:25.515
"it was made of gold
from the crown of the last king.

52:25.643 --> 52:29.636
"Your father liked a good story,
so I don't know if that's true.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.023
"But it is nice to think so."

52:32.400 --> 52:34.356
"I hand it on to you

52:34.485 --> 52:37.648
"with all love and respect."

52:47.248 --> 52:49.034
We wait until the roads are dry

52:49.167 --> 52:52.455
and then march south through
Arretium and on to Rome.

52:53.504 --> 52:56.667
That is clearly the best plan of action.

52:59.344 --> 53:01.005
You object, Lepidus?

53:04.015 --> 53:05.380
Not at all.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.598
Sounds eminently feasible.

53:08.603 --> 53:10.218
A touch aggressive, perhaps.

53:10.355 --> 53:12.346
General Antony, sir.

54:20.049 --> 54:21.550
I'm not sure about the beard.

54:49.954 --> 54:52.821
How on earth
did you manage to get here

54:52.957 --> 54:54.117
all alone?

54:56.836 --> 54:58.952
I'm not alone.

56:04.153 --> 56:07.111
A cow can't have three balls.

56:08.449 --> 56:10.030
I hear. It's not funny.

56:37.979 --> 56:39.435
It smells delicious.

56:40.189 --> 56:41.395
Thank you, Father.

56:41.524 --> 56:43.105
I hope you like it.

57:00.126 --> 57:01.161
Family.

57:01.544 --> 57:03.535
Family.
