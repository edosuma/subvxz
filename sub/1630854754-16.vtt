I think it's important
to represent for drag

08:08.888 --> 08:12.158
and drag artists right now
because drag is freedom

08:12.158 --> 08:14.827

we get to erase ourselves

08:14.827 --> 08:16.562

10:36.602 --> 10:39.472
[vocalizing]

10:43.342 --> 10:44.744
I will survive

10:44.744 --> 10:46.979
I will climb like a lotus

10:46.979 --> 10:48.781
Nothing is hopeless

10:48.781 --> 10:50.716
I already know this

10:50.716 --> 10:52.218
I will survive

10:52.218 --> 10:54.420
I will climb like a lotus

10:54.420 --> 10:56.122
Nothing is hopeless

10:56.122 --> 10:58.424
I already know this

10:58.424 --> 10:59.725
[music concludes]

10:59.725 --> 11:02.628
[cheers and applause]

11:08.000 --> 11:09.435
Yeah!

11:12.104 --> 11:15.007
Wow, that was amazing.

11:16.142 --> 11:19.211
It's time for
the judges' critiques.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.815
Anetra, you betta slay
that fuckin' lotus.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.784
[laughter]

11:24.784 --> 11:26.519
Yes.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.923
Anetra, you're the Portia
of this "White Lotus," okay?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.759
- Yes.
- You are amazing,

11:33.759 --> 11:36.162
and I'm so glad that you
made it this far.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.197
- Eat it up, girl.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.337
So, Anetra,
how has your life changed

11:45.337 --> 11:47.306
since being on "Drag Race"?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.909
It's been absolutely
incredible travelling around

11:49.909 --> 11:52.645
and spreading all of this queerness

11:52.645 --> 11:54.680
and flamin' hot pussy everywhere.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.449
[laughter]

11:58.417 --> 12:01.554
So drag queens are superheroes.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.389
What's your superpower?

12:03.389 --> 12:06.058
Leaping over women with BFAs.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.763
- [cheers and applause]
- Yes, Marcia.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.499
- A boss bitch.
- Okay.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.901
So then what
is your kryptonite?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.169
Ooh.

12:17.169 --> 12:20.106
Like, any brown man over,
like, 6'.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.141
[laughter]

12:25.244 --> 12:28.013
So who's here
supporting you tonight?

12:28.013 --> 12:31.150
I have my step-mom
and my father here tonight.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.320
Ahh.
[cheers and applause]

12:34.320 --> 12:36.088
So Papa Anetra,

12:36.088 --> 12:38.324
I know you've been
trying on Anetra's wigs.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.025
Which one's your favorite?

12:40.025 --> 12:42.128
- All of 'em.
- Really?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.930
Are you a pussycat wig
or a long fall?

12:44.930 --> 12:45.931
Long fall.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.199
- Long fall.
- Oh, wow.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.135
- [laughter]
- Come on, now.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.704
So, Papa Anetra,
America wants to know:

12:51.704 --> 12:53.973
Can you walk that fucking duck?

12:53.973 --> 12:55.775
Um, hell no.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
[laughter]

12:57.777 --> 12:59.745
- He's got bad knees.
- Oh, you've got bad knees.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.348
- Yes. Yeah.
- I get it.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.950
So, Papa Anetra,
what advice do you have

13:04.950 --> 13:08.754
for families raising
a drag artist?

13:08.754 --> 13:10.956
For anybody that's out there,

13:10.956 --> 13:14.460
always love, support,
and just be there for them.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.663
That's--that's the main thing
you can do for anybody.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.565
[cheers and applause]

13:21.433 --> 13:22.935
[quietly] I love you.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.436
I love that.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.939
Chile, all her ducks are
in a mothertucking row.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.974
Give it up for Anetra.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.913
You make me feel,
whisper in my ear

13:33.913 --> 13:35.614
If you're Team Anetra,

13:35.614 --> 13:37.950
sound off using #DragRace.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.719
You make me feel,
whisper in my ear

13:40.719 --> 13:42.254
Welcome back
to the grand finale

13:42.254 --> 13:43.856
or "RuPaul's Drag Race."

13:43.856 --> 13:46.592
Our top four showdown continues.

13:46.592 --> 13:50.196
Our next queen has a design
for the dramatic.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.263
Take a look.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.634
- [upbeat pop music]
- The "it" girl has arrived

13:55.634 --> 13:57.436
in mint condition.

13:57.436 --> 14:00.539
I'm the saint, the brand,
the fantasy.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.808
I came into the competition
talking a big game,

14:02.808 --> 14:04.043
and I definitely do think that

14:04.043 --> 14:05.644
I put my money
where my mouth is.

14:05.644 --> 14:08.180
I walked into the Werkroom
40 inches first

14:08.180 --> 14:10.082
and won a couple challenges.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.450
I was in the top a lot.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.118
I have had some
pretty stellar looks,

14:13.118 --> 14:15.821
some pretty sickening fits
and fashions on the runway.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.089
[screams]

14:17.089 --> 14:19.525
I think that I bring
a certain joy to drag.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.160
I just have something that
just gives it

14:21.160 --> 14:23.562
that little extra "mmm" to it,
you know?

14:23.562 --> 14:25.431
It's just this je ne sais quoi.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.701
I do live my life with
a suit of confidence on.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.370
I also have feelings,
and I also have a heart.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.738
Checkmate.

14:32.738 --> 14:36.141
Winning "Drag Race" would mean
a lot to me.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.444
I want this more than anything
I've ever wanted.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.512
I want this so bad.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.848
Like, I will do anything
for it.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.317
Like, I will commit crime.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.785
I--well, not too bad.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.021
For, like, a petty crime
where I'd, like,

14:49.021 --> 14:50.990
you know, just be arrested
but not go to prison,

14:50.990 --> 14:52.625
like stealing or something
like that.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.293
Hello? RuPaul?

14:54.293 --> 14:56.996
Oh, my God, yes!
I'll take the $200,000.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.063
Of course!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.265
When I tell you,

14:59.265 --> 15:01.100
I am feeling
all of the emotion

15:01.100 --> 15:02.768
in being here at the finale.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.704
It's very surreal,
but it feels very correct.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.207
The original song that I will
be performing tonight,

15:08.207 --> 15:09.441
it's about being lavish.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.843
It's about fashion.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.612
It's, you know,
just full of life.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.682
I am beyond excited for the
world to see this performance.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.118
I think the other three girls
would be crazy

15:19.118 --> 15:22.121
to not be worried about
what I have up my sleeve.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.256
And the sleeve is Versace.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.794
[cheers and applause]

15:28.794 --> 15:31.764
And now, Luxx Noir London.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.933
[up-tempo electronic music]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.101
Ooh

15:36.101 --> 15:39.605
They don't dun-da-da
like they do in London

15:39.605 --> 15:41.540
They don't kiss, kiss,
au revoir

15:41.540 --> 15:43.542
Like they do in Paris

15:43.542 --> 15:45.344
They don't ra-ka-ta-ta-ka-ka

15:45.344 --> 15:46.912
Like they do in Milan

15:46.912 --> 15:48.580
But the thing they
got in common

15:48.580 --> 15:49.982
What?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.150
The thing that brings
the action

15:51.150 --> 15:52.251
- What?
- Let me say it, bitch.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.252
Quit asking.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.520

16:02.227 --> 16:03.796
It's giving fashion

16:03.796 --> 16:06.532
I'd like to keep
that camera flashing

16:13.706 --> 16:15.808
I can kiss, kiss, au revoir

16:15.808 --> 16:17.476
Like they do in Paris

16:17.476 --> 16:19.378
I can ra-ka-ta-ta-ka-ka

16:19.378 --> 16:20.913
Like they do in Milan

16:20.913 --> 16:22.514
And the thing we got in common

16:22.514 --> 16:23.916
What?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.084
The thing that brings
the action

16:25.084 --> 16:26.185
- What?
- Let me say it, bitch.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.319
Quit asking.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.356
We're giving fashion

16:30.356 --> 16:32.291

16:32.291 --> 16:34.860

16:40.065 --> 16:42.401
I'd like to keep that

[cheers and applause]

17:12.297 --> 17:13.966
[RuPaul laughs]

17:16.869 --> 17:19.838
Luxx, that was giving me fashion.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.174
Let's hear from the judges.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.910
Luxx Noir London Visage,

17:24.910 --> 17:28.547
you have made me
and the entire Garden State

17:28.547 --> 17:30.382
so very proud.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.518
So, so well done, Luxx.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.553
- So proud of you, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.822
Luxx, it's giving all the Fs:

17:36.822 --> 17:39.792
Fashion, face, and ferocity.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.361
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]

17:42.361 --> 17:45.664
Now, Luxx, you have a drag
race quote for everything.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.700
Is there a quote that sums up
how you're feeling right now?

17:48.700 --> 17:49.835
Hmm.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.570
I actually think I have
the perfect one.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.906
"I can't wait to see
how this turns out."

17:53.906 --> 17:56.275
[laughter]

17:56.275 --> 17:58.911
[cheers and applause]

17:58.911 --> 18:02.714
So, joking aside,
how are you feeling right now?

18:02.714 --> 18:04.516
I'm feeling on top
of the world.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.218
I've been dreaming
of this moment

18:06.218 --> 18:09.221
since I even knew
what "Drag Race" was.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.256
I just saw myself here
in the finale.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.926
And it's wild to think that

18:13.926 --> 18:16.295
when you really put
so much heart

18:16.295 --> 18:17.930
and energy and effort

18:17.930 --> 18:20.332
into what you really want
to achieve in life,

18:20.332 --> 18:21.967
the possibilities are endless.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.635
Yes. I love that.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.304
It's true.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.339
So, Luxx, who's here
supporting you tonight?

18:27.339 --> 18:29.641
- My lovely mother...
- Hi, my baby.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.176
And my boyfriend, Thomas.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.245
- Hey, my love.
- Oh, gorgeous.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.380
I love you, my baby.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.915
So, Mother Luxx,

18:36.915 --> 18:39.251
where does Luxx get
the creativity from?

18:39.251 --> 18:42.321
Well, he get his creativity
from my mom.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.789
She's no longer with us,

18:43.789 --> 18:46.525
but I know she's looking down
at Luxx so happy.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.527
And he gets it from me
and his dad,

18:48.527 --> 18:51.663
so it's the whole family
he gets his creativity--

18:51.663 --> 18:53.532
So--you're all very modest,
aren't you?

18:53.532 --> 18:55.467
Yes.
[laughter]

18:55.467 --> 18:57.202
Yes.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.472
Thomas, tell me,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.241
what's your favorite thing
about Luxx?

19:02.241 --> 19:03.542
Everything.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.978
- I love everything about them.
- Aw.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.479
I'm so proud.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.148
So proud.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.316
That's very sweet.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.919
So, Luxx, final question:

19:13.919 --> 19:16.021
Why do you love drag?

19:16.021 --> 19:18.090
I love drag because

19:18.090 --> 19:21.293
I'm able to express every
wild, crazy thought

19:21.293 --> 19:23.662
that I've ever had
in my entire life--

19:23.662 --> 19:25.097
and trust me, there's plenty.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.431
It's the reason I wake up
in the morning

19:26.431 --> 19:28.000
and it's what keeps me
up at night.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.502
I wouldn't be half the person
I am today

19:30.502 --> 19:32.337
if I'd never discovered drag.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.372
I love it.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.773
Well, she's got beaucoup style

19:34.773 --> 19:36.108
and a whole lot
of "Black Butta."

19:36.108 --> 19:38.343
Give it up
for Luxx Noir London.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.446

Welcome back to the grand
finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

19:55.227 --> 19:57.129
Tonight we wanna take a moment

19:57.129 --> 20:00.165

You know what I always say:

20:06.371 --> 20:09.441
Cher was born naked
and the rest was Bob Mackie.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.709
[laughter]

20:10.709 --> 20:12.778
Growing up, Bob Mackie
always dreamed

20:12.778 --> 20:14.580
of a life in show business.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.081
When he was 21 years old,

20:16.081 --> 20:19.017
his grandmother gave Bob
his first sewing machine,

20:19.017 --> 20:20.886
and he never looked back.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.855
Bob moved to Hollywood where
he began his dazzling career

20:23.855 --> 20:25.924
at Paramount Studios.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.793
Bob married
actress Lulu Porter

20:27.793 --> 20:29.962
and the two have a son, Robin.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.997
Later, Bob worked
as an assistant

20:31.997 --> 20:33.899
to designer Ray Aghayan.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.400
A romance blossomed,

20:35.400 --> 20:36.969
and the pair became
life partners

20:36.969 --> 20:39.938
in a relationship
that lasted 50 years.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.173
A talented artist,

20:41.173 --> 20:42.975
Bob sketched
the infamous dress

20:42.975 --> 20:46.712
Marilyn Monroe wore when she
sang "Happy Birthday" to JFK.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.715
From there, Bob created
his own signature style.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.718
Soon, every leading lady
was begging to wear

20:52.718 --> 20:54.486
a Bob Mackie original.

20:54.486 --> 20:57.322
Bob designed costumes
for all 11 seasons

20:57.322 --> 20:58.790
of "The Carol Burnett Show."

20:58.790 --> 21:01.026
Many times, I didn't know
how I was going

21:01.026 --> 21:03.829
to do a character in a sketch

21:03.829 --> 21:06.965
until I went to the costume
fitting on Wednesday

21:06.965 --> 21:09.801
and saw what Bob
had created for me.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.603
In his six-decade career,

21:11.603 --> 21:14.306
Bob has transfixed
TV audiences,

21:14.306 --> 21:16.875
brightened Broadway,
lit up Las Vegas,

21:16.875 --> 21:19.278
and set the silver screen
on fire.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.382
Today, Bob Mackie remains
in a class all by himself,

21:23.382 --> 21:25.584
and a new generation
of leading ladies

21:25.584 --> 21:29.054
is still begging to wear
a Bob Mackie original.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.722
Look at just his body
of work on me.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.859
I mean, if you look at
every young girl, hip girl

21:33.859 --> 21:36.728
has got a version
of something that I've worn.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.664
Bob Mackie is my hero,

21:38.664 --> 21:42.000
and it was a dream come true
to wear his creations,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.936
and an even bigger thrill
when he agreed

21:44.936 --> 21:47.239
to be the first ever
guest judge

21:47.239 --> 21:48.607
on "RuPaul's Drag Race."

21:48.607 --> 21:50.175
Mr. Bob Mackie.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.610
Hey, Ru. You're gorgeous.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.345
15 seasons later,

21:53.345 --> 21:55.414
Bob Mackie continues
to inspire.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.448
Who's the designer?

21:56.448 --> 21:58.583
It's an original Bob Mackie.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.118
Mackie, doll.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.454
I'm sure Mr. Mackie
will love that too.

22:02.454 --> 22:03.789
I hope he does.

22:03.789 --> 22:06.625
In recognition of his
priceless contributions

22:06.625 --> 22:08.894
to glamour, beauty,
and excitement,

I know I gag the girls.

23:12.991 --> 23:14.893
That's why I'm the showstopper.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.729
I literally wake up
thinking about drag.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.964
Drag is my job.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.465
Drag is what I do
in my free time.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.100
This is more than
just my career.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.735
This is literally my life.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.570

different people.

23:27.205 --> 23:29.040
Of course I put out
for Houston, Texas.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.076
But most importantly tonight,
I'm representing

23:31.076 --> 23:33.211

been told they couldn't.

that you can

23:35.013 --> 23:36.681
as long as you put
your mind to it.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.886
The "Drag Race" journey
has been a very unique one.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.988
I'm happy to say that
when I got to "Drag Race,"

23:42.988 --> 23:45.690
I wasn't, like, totally
thrown off by anything.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.092

that I was gonna

but, I mean,

23:52.697 --> 23:54.132
I always act a fool
and cut up,

23:54.132 --> 23:56.435
so I know I'll at least
be cute at it.

my emotional moments.

Now, Mistress, why are drag
families so important?

28:44.422 --> 28:46.357
My drag family is my family,

28:46.357 --> 28:48.793
and I've learned so many
life lessons through drag,

28:48.793 --> 28:51.329
and I owe so much to that woman
sitting right there.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.264
She's taught me so much
as an entertainer,

28:53.264 --> 28:55.166
but more importantly,
as a person

28:55.166 --> 28:57.402
and how to navigate my life
and a queer person.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.804
And because of her,
I get to travel

28:59.804 --> 29:01.272
and carry on that legacy

29:01.272 --> 29:03.341
and, of course,
nurture the next generation,

29:03.341 --> 29:05.110
even if they're five days
younger than me

29:05.110 --> 29:07.145
like my daughters
Sugar and Spice.

is a rare combination

of face, grace,

There have been
so many fun memories.

I have evolved so much,

I would spell it,
but I don't know how.

but the goddess of what?

of this journey here?

is actually meeting

33:51.095 --> 33:52.997
all of the fans of "Drag Race,"

33:52.997 --> 33:55.767

33:55.767 --> 33:57.535
come up to me all over
the place,

33:57.535 --> 34:00.104
and they just are so
not just accepting

34:00.104 --> 34:01.806

34:03.508 --> 34:06.944
Now, I've heard you
use the term mahu.

34:06.944 --> 34:08.279
What does that mean?

34:08.279 --> 34:10.281
Okay, so mahu in Hawaiian,

34:10.281 --> 34:12.617
it's the third gender
in Hawaiian culture.

34:12.617 --> 34:16.454

trusted queer people and mahus

34:16.454 --> 34:18.022
to handle their kids

34:18.022 --> 34:21.059
because what is more divine
than knowing

and masculine energy?

to what you do.

tingly inside?

so I have to... you know.

dream of doing next?

[singing] We deserve

37:30.815 --> 37:32.316
To be who we are

37:32.316 --> 37:36.320
Baby, it's not your call

37:36.320 --> 37:39.190
Last summer, we filmed
"Wigloose: The Rusical."

37:39.190 --> 37:42.360
set in an American town
where drag was outlawed.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.728
[dramatic chord]

37:43.728 --> 37:45.162
Less than a year later,

37:45.162 --> 37:47.632
that fiction has become
a harsh reality,

37:47.632 --> 37:51.602
reminding us that we can take
our human rights for granted.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.872
[applause]

37:54.872 --> 37:57.708
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

37:57.708 --> 38:00.278

are created equal."

38:00.278 --> 38:02.246
That they are endowed
by their creator

38:02.246 --> 38:04.081
with certain unalienable rights.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.983
That among these are life...

38:05.983 --> 38:07.184
Liberty...

38:07.184 --> 38:08.753
And the pursuit
of happiness.

38:08.753 --> 38:11.989
Why would you ever wanna
take away someone's happiness?

38:11.989 --> 38:13.491
As proud Americans,

38:13.491 --> 38:15.159
there are so many things
that connect us.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.494
- That connect us.
- That connect us.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.695
That connect us.

38:17.695 --> 38:20.231
But there are forces
in this country

38:20.231 --> 38:22.133
that wanna divide us.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.635
Queer people don't come
from another planet.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.870
We are your sons.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.138
We're your daughters.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.673
We're your neighbors.

38:28.673 --> 38:29.674
We're your favorite uncles.

38:29.674 --> 38:30.741
We're your tias.

38:30.741 --> 38:31.976
We're police officers.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.210
We're your teachers.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.046
- Firefighters.
- We're nurses.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.847
- Caretakers.
- We're immigrants.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.083
- Drag kings.
- We're priests.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.919
So the next time someone
tries to scare you with lies...

38:41.919 --> 38:43.454
Or tries to tell you
what to wear...

38:43.454 --> 38:45.690
- Who to love...
- Or how to be...

38:45.690 --> 38:46.824
Remind them...

38:46.824 --> 38:49.794
I am American.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.462
both: I am American.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.631
I am American.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.333
- all: All of us...
- Share the same

38:55.333 --> 38:56.534
American dream.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.035
- all: All of us...
- Should share

38:58.035 --> 39:00.271
the same American rights.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.672
We're all born naked.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.541
And the rest is drag.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.076
all: And the rest is drag.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.011
all: The rest is drag.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.714
And the rest... is drag.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.550

39:21.158 --> 39:23.994
[singing] Drag is a fight

39:23.994 --> 39:26.030
Drag is a protest

39:26.030 --> 39:27.732
Drag only reveals

39:27.732 --> 39:30.334
Who you really are

39:32.770 --> 39:35.506
If you wanna shine

39:35.506 --> 39:37.441
Then you know this

39:37.441 --> 39:42.446
The kinda love we grow
can't grow in the dark

39:43.180 --> 39:46.951
The pride that we feel

39:46.951 --> 39:49.520
The power we hold

39:49.520 --> 39:53.958
In our high heels

39:53.958 --> 39:58.662
The rights that we've earned

39:58.662 --> 40:01.031
Where we began

40:01.031 --> 40:04.101
And what we learned

40:04.101 --> 40:09.106

40:09.874 --> 40:12.777
Ooh ooh

40:12.777 --> 40:15.946
Ooh, ooh

40:17.481 --> 40:21.118

40:21.118 --> 40:24.755
The power we hold

40:24.755 --> 40:27.958
In our high heels

40:29.059 --> 40:33.130
The rights that we've earned

40:33.130 --> 40:35.800
Where we began

40:35.800 --> 40:39.069
And what we've learned

40:39.069 --> 40:40.938
Was built on

40:40.938 --> 40:44.275
Drag

40:44.275 --> 40:46.677
Was built on

40:46.677 --> 40:50.147
Drag

40:50.147 --> 40:52.883
Was built on

40:52.883 --> 40:56.821
Drag

41:00.057 --> 41:03.093
Everybody's
going wigloose

41:03.093 --> 41:05.963
Grab a wig and put it on you

41:05.963 --> 41:08.799
There's a queen
that wants to come through

41:08.799 --> 41:11.902
Oh, everybody's going wigloose

41:11.902 --> 41:15.206
All these sisters
waitin' for you

41:15.206 --> 41:17.741
There's a queen
that wants to come through

41:17.741 --> 41:20.778
Oh, everybody's going wigloose

41:20.778 --> 41:23.047

41:32.022 --> 41:33.691
[singing] I hate people

41:35.125 --> 41:37.127

41:38.329 --> 41:40.397

41:59.917 --> 42:01.519
People

42:01.519 --> 42:03.087
[cheers and applause]

42:08.526 --> 42:11.428
What are you all doing
in my bathroom?

42:11.428 --> 42:13.264
I'm so excited to be here

42:13.264 --> 42:15.266
to help pass on the crown

42:15.266 --> 42:17.968
to America's next
drag superstar.

42:17.968 --> 42:20.304
This year has been wild.

42:20.304 --> 42:23.574
Mushroom sales have skyrocketed
since my crowning.

42:23.574 --> 42:28.212
And most importantly, for
the first time in my life...

42:28.212 --> 42:30.648
I topped.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.521
It's also been a year of grief
and personal struggles.

42:37.521 --> 42:40.291
But I'm at a place where I
really, really love what I do.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.661
So just know if the winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

42:43.661 --> 42:45.796
the most adored woman
in America,

42:45.796 --> 42:49.033
with her gorgeous ass
is struggling,

42:49.033 --> 42:51.101
then it's okay if you are too.

42:51.101 --> 42:54.338
[cheers and applause]

42:55.406 --> 42:57.675
And for whichever queen
wins tonight,

42:57.675 --> 42:59.777
I've one piece of advice.

42:59.777 --> 43:02.379
Only shoplift
the small things, okay?

43:07.184 --> 43:10.821
Now, ladies, gentlemen,

You know,
I got a little work done.

43:41.251 --> 43:42.686
Meow.

43:42.686 --> 43:44.922
But that's not the only
reason I'm here.

The reason I'm here
is to announce

43:46.590 --> 43:49.326

45:40.804 --> 45:43.173

45:43.173 --> 45:46.944
I guess I'm finally

45:47.845 --> 45:50.414

Aah!

47:24.608 --> 47:26.376
Ha ha ha ha ha!

47:26.376 --> 47:28.912
The stress is just
really getting to me.

47:28.912 --> 47:30.480
- Your ear falling off--
- You're gonna have to

47:30.480 --> 47:32.983
speak up--I can only
hear you half as well.

47:32.983 --> 47:34.852
Yeah, yeah.

47:34.852 --> 47:37.588
I'll have whatever intestinal
parasite she's having.

47:39.656 --> 47:41.391
Now that we're at
the midway point...

47:41.391 --> 47:43.727
is that my camera?

47:43.727 --> 47:46.997
Drag is... my passion,

47:46.997 --> 47:49.833

47:49.833 --> 47:51.368

What's the one conclusion

50:14.311 --> 50:19.249
I can bring this number to?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.718
Ha ha ha ha ha.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.642
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

51:18.642 --> 51:23.647
Now, I'm here with
Broadway star Jinkx Monsoon

51:26.883 --> 51:29.352
Darling... may I call you Mama?

51:29.352 --> 51:31.521
Oh, well, of course.

51:31.521 --> 51:33.156
I may be Mama,

51:33.156 --> 51:36.827
but you will always be Mother.

51:39.596 --> 51:42.332
So what's next
for you, Jinkx?

51:42.332 --> 51:43.900
Well, you can see me

51:43.900 --> 51:47.270
on my 44-city
North American tour

51:47.270 --> 51:51.875
called "Everything at Stake
This Summer."

51:53.243 --> 51:55.445
I love that.
So you're gonna go everywhere.

51:55.445 --> 51:57.614
You know,
everywhere that'll have me.

51:57.614 --> 52:00.050
- Okay.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

52:00.050 --> 52:02.452
Now--
Ha ha ha ha!

52:06.423 --> 52:07.824
Now, Jinkx, before you go,

52:07.824 --> 52:10.494
I have a little something
I wanna show you.

52:11.895 --> 52:14.264
Now, Jinkx, what do you think
your life's gonna be like?

52:14.264 --> 52:15.832
What do you wanna do?

52:15.832 --> 52:17.801
It's been my life dream,
ever since I started doing drag

52:17.801 --> 52:19.536
to do drag on Broadway.

52:19.536 --> 52:21.238
I can see you
as Blanche DuBois.

52:21.238 --> 52:23.807
I could see that too!

52:23.807 --> 52:26.877
Wow!
[cheers and applause]

52:30.780 --> 52:32.115
Well...

52:32.115 --> 52:34.618
dreams really do come true.

52:37.454 --> 52:40.957
Ru, thank you for all
that you have done for me

52:40.957 --> 52:43.126
and for drag queens everywhere

52:43.126 --> 52:46.196
and for the world of drag,
my gosh!

52:46.196 --> 52:49.699
You know, it's like
drag gave me a path

52:49.699 --> 52:51.835
to make my dreams come true.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.070
It just feels like

52:54.070 --> 52:58.141
amazing when you know
who you're supposed to be

52:58.141 --> 53:00.911
and you fight for the ability
to be that,

53:00.911 --> 53:02.879
