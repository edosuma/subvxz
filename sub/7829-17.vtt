to car-pool in one

01:07.108 --> 01:09.069

01:09.152 --> 01:10.528
Huh? Huh?

01:10.612 --> 01:11.821
You missed
the race, Mama.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.991
Hmm. I wish
I'd pay more attention.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.080
Smithers, this beer
isn't working.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.123
I don't feel
any younger or funkier.

Ooh, damnation!

01:39.057 --> 01:40.058
Tell them to go slower.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.142
Yes, Sir.

Hi, guys, can we keep
it in first gear

01:45.855 --> 01:46.856

Go! Go!

Slow down.

BURNS: Excellent.

02:08.169 --> 02:12.132
Oh, this novelty foam hand
is ludicrously oversized.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
Go swap it
for a smaller one.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.969
It is a bit
ostentatious, Sir.

02:16.052 --> 02:16.928
I'll be right back.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.141
Hey, Burnsie!

02:21.224 --> 02:23.309
Ha! This was some
swell shindig.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.519
Thank you very much.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.687
Smithers,
what's happening?!

02:25.770 --> 02:27.021
I had a great time.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.315
I just want
to shake your hand.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.194
(mumbling)
You're the greatest.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.612
Smithers, help!

02:34.696 --> 02:36.739
Doesn't seem as funny to me,
but what do I know?

02:36.823 --> 02:37.782
BURNS: Smithers!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.785
Oh, my God!

02:43.496 --> 02:44.706
Yah.

02:44.789 --> 02:45.999
(yelling)

02:48.543 --> 02:49.752
You should have seen

02:49.836 --> 02:51.963
the murderous glint
in his eye, Smithers,

02:52.046 --> 02:55.466
and his breath reeked
of beer and pretzeled bread.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.052
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
This was all my fault.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.679
Don't concern yourself.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.932
If things had turned ugly,
I always had my mace.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.518
Don't let me off the hook
that easily, Sir.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.812
I failed you and I'll
never forgive myself.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.732
Never! Never! Never!
Never! Never!

03:12.567 --> 03:14.402

03:14.485 --> 03:16.529
SMITHERS:
<i>Never! Never! Never!</i>

03:20.074 --> 03:21.451
Good morning, Sir.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.161
To make up for my
failure last night

03:23.244 --> 03:24.913
I've alphabetized
your breakfast.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.581
You can start
with the waffles

03:26.664 --> 03:27.665
and work your way
up to the Zwieback,

03:27.749 --> 03:28.708
and to prevent
newsprint

03:28.791 --> 03:30.126
from rubbing off
on your hands

03:30.210 --> 03:32.128
I've laminated
today's newspaper.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.463
I appreciate the thought

03:33.546 --> 03:34.881
but my pen
won't write on this.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.716
How am I supposed to do
the Junior Jumble?

03:38.676 --> 03:41.346
Oh! I can't
even grovel properly.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.889
I'm a buffoon!

03:42.972 --> 03:45.266
I don't deserve to live
on your planet anymore!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.685
(crashing)

03:47.769 --> 03:51.272
(gurgling)

03:51.356 --> 03:52.315
(gasps)

03:52.398 --> 03:54.859
Pull yourself
together, man.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.903
I daresay you're in need
of a long vacation.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.738
No! Don't make me
take a vacation!

03:58.821 --> 04:01.241
Without you,
I'll wither and die!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.243
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.953
But what would you
do without me, Sir?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.287
(scoffs)
I'm not a baby

04:06.371 --> 04:08.414
who needs a nursemaid
to burp me.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.415
(burps)

04:09.499 --> 04:10.541
You see?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.085
Now, I insist
you take a vacation

04:12.168 --> 04:13.461
just as soon as

04:13.544 --> 04:15.546
a temporary substitute
can be found.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.006
Yeesh!

04:20.885 --> 04:23.888
I've got to find a replacement
who won't outshine me.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.182
Perhaps if I search
the employee evaluations

04:26.266 --> 04:29.102
for the word "incompetent."

04:29.185 --> 04:31.229
-(beeps)
-714 names?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.231
Better be more specific.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.067
"Lazy," "clumsy,"

04:36.150 --> 04:37.986
"dim-witted,"

04:38.069 --> 04:40.405
"monstrously ugly."

04:42.115 --> 04:43.157
Aw, nuts to this.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.325
I'll just go
get Homer Simpson.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.287
HOMER:
I think Smithers picked me

04:47.370 --> 04:48.830
because of
my motivational skills.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.331
Everyone always says

04:50.415 --> 04:52.041
they have to work a lot
harder when I'm around.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.793
You know, Dad,
assisting Mr. Burns

04:53.876 --> 04:55.712
could give your career
a real shot in the arm.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.547
You know, Homer,
assisting Mr. Burns

04:57.630 --> 04:59.674
could give your career
a real shot in the arm.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.551
Mom, I just
said that.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.219
Sor-ry!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.763
Next time, get
your own darned corn.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.099
Um, is this the chair
I'll be sitting on?

05:08.182 --> 05:09.309
Yeah.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.476
Now, I realize
caring for Mr. Burns

05:10.560 --> 05:12.020
seems like a big job

05:12.103 --> 05:14.272
but actually,
it's 2,800 small jobs.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.190
Uh-huh, but this is
the chair, right?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.818
Your new duties will include
answering Mr. Burns' phone

05:18.901 --> 05:21.195
preparing his tax return,
moistening his eyeballs,

05:21.279 --> 05:22.864
assisting with his chewing
and swallowing,

05:22.947 --> 05:25.074
lying to congress
and some light typing.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.284
(phone ringing)

05:26.367 --> 05:27.327
Montgomery Burns'
office.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.786
Oh, hello, Mrs. Burns.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.538
I'll see if your son
is available.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.165
Mr. Burns
has a mother?!

05:32.248 --> 05:34.375
She must be a hundred
million years old!

05:34.459 --> 05:36.210
She has limited
capacities.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.837
All she can do
is dial and yell.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.339
I'm sorry.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.382
Monty can't come
to the phone right now.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.092
He's in a very
important meeting

05:43.176 --> 05:44.594
and can't be disturbed.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.350
Uh-huh.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.018
Okay, I'll give him
the message.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.145
Mr. Burns can't stand
talking to his mother.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.605
He never forgave her

05:55.688 --> 05:57.815
for having that affair
with President Taft.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.192
(chuckling)

05:59.275 --> 06:01.110
Taft, you old dog.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.031
Really, Smithers.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.657
I'll be fine.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.950
I'm sure your replacement

06:08.034 --> 06:09.827
will be able
to handle everything.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.162
Who is he anyway?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.455
Uh, Homer Simpson, Sir.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.582
One of your organ banks
from sector 7G.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.876
All the recent events
of your life

06:16.959 --> 06:19.295
have revolved
around him in some way.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.047
Simpson, eh?

06:21.130 --> 06:23.591
HOMER: Uh, Mr. Smithers?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.344
I don't understand
2,700 of my new duties.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.887
Well, the van's leaving.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.514
Which one duty is giving you
the most trouble?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.224
Um...

06:31.307 --> 06:33.434
What do I do in case of fire?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.520
(muffled)
Sorry. Can't hear you. Bye!

06:39.857 --> 06:42.235
(crackling)

06:42.318 --> 06:45.029
Aw. Just my luck.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.329
(panting)

06:53.413 --> 06:54.497
(gasping)
Good Lord, Smithers,

06:54.580 --> 06:55.748
you look atrocious!

06:55.832 --> 06:57.333
I thought I told you
to take a vacation.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.168
Uh, Smithers
already left, Sir.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.295
I'm his replacement,
Homer Simpson.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.964
Ah, yes, Simpson.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.757
I'll have my lunch now.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.176
A single pillow
of shredded wheat

07:07.260 --> 07:09.220
some steamed toast,
and a dodo egg.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.430
But I think
the dodo went extinct.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.473
Get going!
And answer those phones,

07:12.557 --> 07:14.851
install the computer system,
and rotate my office

07:14.934 --> 07:16.144
so the window
faces the hills.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.897
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Okay.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.400
Um, can you repeat
the part of the stuff

07:22.483 --> 07:25.695
where you said
all about the things?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.280
Uh, the things?

07:27.363 --> 07:29.991
(quiet snarl)

07:33.202 --> 07:34.495
(alarm buzzes)

07:37.874 --> 07:39.667
(grunting)

07:39.750 --> 07:41.961
Lousy two-legged pants.

07:42.044 --> 07:44.714
Homie, it's 4:30
in the morning.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.466
Little Rascals
isn't on till 6:00.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.050
I know.
I'm taping it.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.385
I want to get to
Mr. Burns' house

07:49.469 --> 07:50.803
bright and early
to make his breakfast.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.222
Mm, poor Homie.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.432
Poor, poor...

07:54.515 --> 07:56.642
(snoring)

08:03.566 --> 08:04.901
Hmm...

08:04.984 --> 08:07.069
One of these must be
a breakfast-maker.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.573
Well, it's my job
to cook him breakfast

08:10.656 --> 08:12.783
and I'm gonna cook
the best damn breakfast

08:12.867 --> 08:14.076
he ever ate.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.250
Hmm...

08:25.546 --> 08:26.422
Hmm...

08:30.301 --> 08:31.302
(groans)

08:36.349 --> 08:37.725
Doughnuts?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.353
I told you
I don't like ethnic food!

08:40.436 --> 08:42.355
Here. Tell me
how my stocks did yesterday.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.774
Uh...

08:44.857 --> 08:46.234
They all won.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.860
Hm?
What about my options?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.779
Well, you can either get up
or go back to sleep.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.531
I believe I'll get up.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.949
(brush scrubbing)

08:53.032 --> 08:54.367
BURNS: Scrub harder.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.451
Got to get that layer
of dead skin off.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.536
HOMER: Ugh.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.750
I think...
the fangs today.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.800
BURNS: Simpson?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.051
Simpson?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.388
Did you get
that report

09:15.471 --> 09:16.597
on the accounting
department?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.266
Yes Sir, I did.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.851
"The accounting department
is located on the third floor.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.396
"Its hours are 9:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m.

09:23.479 --> 09:27.233
The head of this department
is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone."

09:28.818 --> 09:30.069
Here are your messages.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.196
"You have 30 minutes
to move your car."

09:32.280 --> 09:33.698
"You have ten minutes."

09:33.781 --> 09:35.741
"Your car
has been impounded."

09:35.825 --> 09:38.077
"Your car has been
crushed into a cube."

09:38.160 --> 09:39.829
"You have 30 minutes
to move your cube."

09:39.912 --> 09:41.038
(phone rings)

09:41.122 --> 09:42.039
Yeah-lo,
Mr. Burns' office.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.666
Is it about my cube?

09:43.749 --> 09:45.793
It's Mr. Smithers.
He's calling for you.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.461
How's everything going there,
Sir?

09:47.545 --> 09:50.131
I have a lot of free time
on my hands.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.591
If you Fed-Ex me your mail,

09:51.674 --> 09:53.551
I'd be happy to open it
and return it to you.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.344
Everything's fine, Smithers.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.347
This Simpson fellow seems to be
getting dumber by the minute.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.557
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.684
Anyhoo, you just
enjoy your vacation.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.436
(groans)

10:03.519 --> 10:06.314
(snoring)

10:06.397 --> 10:07.648
Look alive,
Simpson!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
I'm not paying you
to goldbrick!

10:09.525 --> 10:10.776
Yes! Yes, Sir...

10:10.860 --> 10:12.194
Now get cracking
on my long division

10:12.278 --> 10:13.654
and don't forget to
show your work, Simpson.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.197
I'll have it on your desk
in the morning, Sir.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.074
Bart, leave
Simpson alone.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.036
(whispering)
Simpson, I need a ride to the library.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.079
Kids, stop exploiting
your father.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.790
Homie, why don't you
lie down and relax?

10:24.874 --> 10:26.459
No time, Marge.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.961
I think Mr. Burns wants me
to do some long division.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.630
Simpson! Lie down!

10:30.713 --> 10:33.841
Sorry, but you need
a good night's rest.

10:33.924 --> 10:34.967
(sighing)

10:35.051 --> 10:36.344
(bell clanging)

10:36.427 --> 10:37.887
BURNS: Simpson!

10:41.807 --> 10:42.767
(bell tinkling)

10:42.850 --> 10:44.310
(panting)

10:44.393 --> 10:46.604
The telephone's been ringing
for some time.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.730
Answer it.

10:48.856 --> 10:49.940
Yello?

10:50.024 --> 10:52.318
It's for you.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.361
<i>♪ Relax... ♪</i>

10:53.444 --> 10:54.862
Mr. Burns-- 48 rings.

10:54.945 --> 10:55.946
Are you all right?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.323
What did Simpson do to you?

10:57.406 --> 10:59.158
Oh, nothing other than drive me
to distraction

10:59.241 --> 11:00.576
with his incompetent boobery.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.496
Terrible at everything.
A complete moron!

11:03.579 --> 11:04.914
(whispering)
But I'm not really free

11:04.997 --> 11:06.582
to talk right now.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.585
Now look, stop calling me and
start enjoying your vacation.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.796
Remember, I want to see
lots of pictures

11:11.879 --> 11:12.880
when you get back.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.965
Actually, sir, picture-taking

11:15.049 --> 11:17.093
is not allowed
at this particular resort.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.552
Oop. I got to go now.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.055
There's a line
forming behind me.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.893
(shuddering)

11:27.770 --> 11:29.230
(yelps)

11:29.313 --> 11:30.523
60 watts!

11:30.606 --> 11:32.525
What do you think this is?
A tanning salon?

11:32.608 --> 11:35.319
I asked for light starch
on my night cap.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.446
(yelling)

11:37.530 --> 11:39.115
You call this Postum?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.617
You call this
a tax return?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.869
You call this
a super computer?

11:43.953 --> 11:47.623
-(grunting)
-D'oh! Ow!

11:47.707 --> 11:50.042
(yelling) You're a travesty
of a joke of an assistant!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.836
(whimpering)

11:51.919 --> 11:55.131
(yelling)

11:57.383 --> 11:59.260
(clock ticking)

12:02.722 --> 12:05.307
(whimpering)

12:05.391 --> 12:07.518
(shrieks)

12:07.601 --> 12:10.104
(gasping)

12:10.187 --> 12:12.398
Is there something
wrong, Homie?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.150
No.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.651
Except?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.278
Except...

12:17.361 --> 12:19.363
I killed Mr. Burns!

12:19.447 --> 12:21.115
What happened, Dad?

12:21.198 --> 12:23.617
I punched Burns right in his
104-year-old face.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.994
Are you sure he's dead?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.287
Maybe you just really,
really hurt him.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.373
Okay. Maybe
everything's all right.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.710
Maybe if you go apologize,
he won't even fire you.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.003
If he's alive.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.468
Mr. Burns?

12:40.551 --> 12:43.846
(raspy breathing)

12:47.933 --> 12:49.477
-(gasps)
-(screams)

12:49.560 --> 12:52.188
I'm really sorry I hit you,
Mr. Burns.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.565
Here-- let me put some salt
on that eye.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.817
No, please!
I can't bear another thrashing.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.068
Just leave me be.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.320
Y-Yes, Sir.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.200
Must call Smithers.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.243
He'll protect me
from this beast.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.205
I've seen people activate
this machine a thousand times.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.165
Doesn't seem to be
any trick to it.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.541
Let's see-- Smithers.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.462
S-m-i-t-h-e-r-s.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.463
(ringing)

13:17.546 --> 13:18.923
Success! It's ringing!

13:19.006 --> 13:20.674
Moe's Tavern.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.009
<i>I'm looking for</i>
<i>a Mr. Smithers.</i>

13:22.092 --> 13:23.594
<i>First name, Waylon.</i>

13:23.677 --> 13:28.057
Oh, so you're looking
for a Mr. Smithers, eh?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.267
First name, Waylon, is it?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.478
Listen to me, you!
When I catch you

13:32.561 --> 13:35.147
I'm gonna pull out your eyes
and shove them down your pants

13:35.231 --> 13:37.650
so you can watch me kick
the crap out of you. Okay?!

13:37.733 --> 13:39.777
Then I'm going to use
your tongue to paint my boat.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.325
Oh, Smithers if only
you could hear me.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.286
(gasps)

13:49.370 --> 13:50.830
Something tells me
Mr. Burns needs me.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.124
(shouting)

13:54.208 --> 13:56.210
Praise God.
I think the thug

13:56.293 --> 13:57.837
has finally gone home
for the day.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.505
Now I can make my escape.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.466
(yelps)

14:02.550 --> 14:04.385
Hi, Mr. Burns.
You want your coffee now?

14:04.468 --> 14:07.346
Uh, no, I'm, uh...
making it myself.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.514
(rattling)

14:08.597 --> 14:09.890
Hear that?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.934
The percolations are imminent.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.310
No need to come in.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.895
Cease your ingress.

14:14.979 --> 14:15.980
(nervous laugh)

14:16.063 --> 14:17.022
(sighs)

14:18.065 --> 14:19.567
(knocking)

14:19.650 --> 14:21.151
Stay back, Homer.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.528
Approach no further.
Coffee's already made.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.572
I stomped the beans myself.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.283
Well, can I at least
drive you home, Mr. Burns?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.159
-It's 5:00.
-No! I thought, uh--

14:29.243 --> 14:31.287
I thought I'd chauffeur
myself this evening.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.913
Yes, that's what I thought.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.331
How difficult could it be?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.041
I'm sure the manual
will indicate

14:36.125 --> 14:39.962
which lever is the velocitator
and which the deceleratrix, hmm?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.089
I can't believe it.

14:42.172 --> 14:45.718
All my life I've avoided
doing things for myself...

14:45.801 --> 14:47.094
but I'm actually enjoying this.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.554
Plus, I'm making
incredible time.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.638
(honking)

14:49.722 --> 14:51.181
Beep beep!
Out of my way!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.182
I'm a motorist.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.101
(screeching)

14:54.184 --> 14:56.562
That's some nice
reckless driving, Mr. B.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.274
Would you like me to shred

15:00.357 --> 15:02.192
those environmental reports
for you, Sir?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.278
Already taken care of.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.696
(chuckling)

15:05.779 --> 15:07.239
Cappuccino, Simpson?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.616
(phone rings)

15:08.699 --> 15:10.326
Ahoy-hoy?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.077
No. You have the wrong number.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.079
This is 5-2-4-6.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.875
I suspect you need more practice
working your telephone machine.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.336
Not at all. Ahoy.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.047
Mr. Burns, is there anything
at all I can do for you?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.632
No, Homer.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.259
You've already done
more for me than any man.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.220
Your brutal attack forced me
to fend for myself.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.681
I realize now that being
waited on hand and foot

15:32.765 --> 15:34.642
is okay for your average Joe,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.393
but it's not for me.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.020
I want to thank you.

15:39.688 --> 15:40.898
Thank you.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.442
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.235
Oh, my God.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.695
I knew I shouldn't have left.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.822
Ah, welcome back,
Smithers.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.491
Say, do you know
Homer Simpson?

15:50.574 --> 15:51.492
He pitched in
around the office

15:51.575 --> 15:53.077
while you were away.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.828
Bang-up job, Simpson,
but I guess it's back

15:54.912 --> 15:56.705
to your trusty post
in sector 7G.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
(sighs)

15:58.374 --> 16:00.084
You heard the man, Simpson.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.210
Ahh.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.087
And my dear, dear Smithers

16:03.170 --> 16:05.422
You're no longer needed at all.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.091
You're fired. Ta!

16:08.717 --> 16:11.095
You shouldn't have
gone away on vacation.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.643
(gobbling)

16:21.230 --> 16:22.856
Cheer up, Homie.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
I just feel terrible about
getting Mr. Smithers fired.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.403
That job was all he had.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.238
Imagine how
you'd feel, Marge

16:29.321 --> 16:31.657
if you got fired
from the...

16:31.740 --> 16:34.159
those things
that... you do.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.745
Quick, Mom, whip up a cake
before Dad fires you.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.080
Don't worry, Dad.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.832
Mr. Smithers
is a resilient man.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.584
I'm sure he can get a great job
at any corporation he wants.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.469
SMITHERS:
Meet your new piano mover.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.929
(groaning)

16:54.013 --> 16:55.222
Now, we're gonna have to put

16:55.305 --> 16:56.765
a steel rod
where your spine was.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.726
Will I ever move
a piano again?

16:58.809 --> 16:59.977
(laughing)

17:00.060 --> 17:02.104
Oh, my goodness
gracious, no.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.230
<i>SMITHERS (on PA):</i>
<i>Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action</i>

17:03.313 --> 17:05.024
<i>at the Springfield Dragstrip.</i>

17:05.107 --> 17:07.776
<i>It'll be motorized mayhem,</i>
<i>mayhem, mayhem...</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:09.445
<i>(lowers voice) Do we need</i>
<i>all those "mayhems"?</i>

17:09.528 --> 17:11.321
<i>We do?</i>
<i>All right, fair enough.</i>

17:11.405 --> 17:12.948
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>you know your business.</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:15.325
<i>(loudly) Get ready for</i>

17:20.581 --> 17:21.832
<i>Let go of me!</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:23.709
<i>Where are you throwing me?!</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:26.253
Uh... hello,

17:26.336 --> 17:27.755
is that a "help wanted" sign
in the window?

17:27.838 --> 17:29.298
Uh, yeah. I need someone
to help me

17:29.381 --> 17:30.632
with the midnight
beer delivery.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.551
Your job is
to distract Barney

17:32.634 --> 17:34.887
until it's safely
off the truck.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.847
I'll just wait out back
until then.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.515
I look forward
to working with you.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.434
Mr. Smithers, wait.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.228
You can't let yourself end up
in a place like this.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.897
You've got two choices.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.984
You can give up on yourself
and take the Barney-guarding job

17:49.068 --> 17:50.986
like so many of us
have contemplated

17:51.070 --> 17:52.362
in our darkest moments,

17:52.446 --> 17:54.114
or you can admit to yourself

17:54.198 --> 17:56.825
there's only one person
that can make you happy

17:56.909 --> 17:59.161
and do whatever it takes
to get them back!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.496
You're right.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.331
But I'm gonna need
your help.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.332
(clock strikes)

18:03.415 --> 18:06.001
Oh, my God!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
TRUCK DRIVER:
Beer delivery. Just sign here.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.588
Oh, no! It's you!

18:09.671 --> 18:10.589
(loud crashing)

18:10.672 --> 18:11.840
(Barney laughing)

18:11.924 --> 18:12.925
-DRIVER: Hey!
-BARNEY: Oh, boy!

18:13.008 --> 18:14.259
DRIVER: Give me that!

18:15.761 --> 18:18.180
(metal clattering)

18:18.263 --> 18:19.515
(loud burp)

18:23.894 --> 18:26.063
Okay, I got you covered.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.983
Mr. Burns may have mastered
2,799 of my 2,800 duties,

18:30.067 --> 18:31.902
but I'll wager dollars
to doughnuts

18:31.985 --> 18:33.904
he still can't handle
a call from his mother.

18:33.987 --> 18:34.863
You're on.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.242
(phone ringing)

18:38.325 --> 18:40.077
What?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.078
Hello, Mrs. Burns?

18:41.161 --> 18:42.663
This is Waylon Smithers.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.581
I have your son
Montgomery on the line.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.042
That improvident lackwit.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.545
Always too busy striding
about his atom mill

18:49.628 --> 18:51.672
to call his own mother.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.508
I'll give him what-fors
till he cries brassafrax!

18:56.635 --> 18:58.720
(chuckling) Perfect.
When I give the signal

18:58.804 --> 19:00.556
you transfer the call
to Mr. Burns.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.766
After she tears into him,
I'll rush in and save the day.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.767
Got it.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.023
I'm transferring a call
in to you, Mr. Burns.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.067
BURNS: <i>No problemo.</i>

19:12.151 --> 19:13.068
Uh...

19:13.152 --> 19:14.069
ooh.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.988
Um...

19:16.071 --> 19:17.156
-(dial tone)
-Uh-oh.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.157
BURNS:
Ahoy-hoy?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.241
Hoy?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.911
(in falsetto)
Hello, Mr. Burns.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.288
This is your mother.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.331
(whispering) No!

19:26.415 --> 19:27.332
Ugh...

19:27.416 --> 19:28.959
Oh, hello, mater.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.337
Um... sorry about pulling
the plug on you and all.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.673
Who could have known
you'd pull through and...

19:34.756 --> 19:37.176
live for another five decades?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.303
Ooh, is my face red.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.722
(whispering)
Mrs. Burns is 122 years old

19:41.805 --> 19:43.473
so try to sound more desiccated.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.226
And she doesn't call
her son "Mr. Burns."

19:46.310 --> 19:49.980
(cracking falsetto)
Son, this is Mrs. Burns.

19:50.063 --> 19:54.234
I just called to say
I don't love you.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.403
You are a bad son, Mon... tel.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.404
So...

19:57.487 --> 19:58.655
(screams)

19:58.739 --> 20:00.991
Impersonate my mother,
will you?

20:01.074 --> 20:03.994
And you, Smithers, you must
have put him up to it.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.537
I'm glad I fired you.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.666
You really blew it
this time, Smithers.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.751
(yells)

20:14.630 --> 20:16.715
Stop that!
Stop that at once!

20:16.798 --> 20:17.841
You're fighting!

20:20.344 --> 20:22.429
Stop fighting
like a girl, Simpson.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.139
(grunting)
Okay.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.310
Heh-heh-heh.

20:30.771 --> 20:31.855
(screams)

20:33.190 --> 20:35.150
Stop it! Stop it, I say!

20:39.947 --> 20:42.491
I'll teach you
how to use a phone, you boob!

20:42.574 --> 20:43.575
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

20:43.659 --> 20:44.576
It's for you.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.535
D'oh!

20:51.792 --> 20:53.460
I'll show you!
(growling)

20:53.543 --> 20:54.878
(chortling)

20:54.962 --> 20:56.838
Ow!

20:58.423 --> 21:00.550
(screaming)

21:00.634 --> 21:02.344
(thudding)

21:02.427 --> 21:03.637
Oh, my...

21:07.849 --> 21:10.018
Here comes the endangered condor

21:10.102 --> 21:11.019
into the power lines.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.230
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.940
I've got Bobo
hot from the dryer.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.441
Careful not to burn yourself
on his eye.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.360
I don't need you
to do any of this.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.405
I'm totally
self-reliant now.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.156
What I would like, though,
is a Spanish peanut.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.994
Skin?

21:27.077 --> 21:29.121
Mmm. Mmm.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.789
It's a remarkable thing.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.582
In the short time
you were gone

21:32.666 --> 21:36.420
I learned to be
completely self-reli...

21:36.503 --> 21:37.921
...ant.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.589
Oh, and as for that
brutish fellow

21:39.673 --> 21:42.301
who knocked me
out the window,

21:42.384 --> 21:44.386
see that he gets
what's coming to him.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.513
I already have, Sir.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.598
What'd you
get that for?

21:48.682 --> 21:50.684
For knocking Mr. Burns out
of a third-story window.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.768
Makes sense to me.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.020
Did he die?

21:53.103 --> 21:55.314
What am I, a doctor?
