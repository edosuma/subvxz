[ECG monitor beeping]

00:08.717 --> 00:10.685
Make 'em nice and tight, love.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.333
[inhales deeply]

00:35.744 --> 00:39.123
(John) Believe it or not,
I came here voluntarily.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.175
My name is John Constantine

00:42.376 --> 00:44.470
and I'm an exorcist.

00:44.670 --> 00:48.174
In my line of work, there are
days you just need to forget..

00:48.382 --> 00:50.350
[muffled scream]

00:53.387 --> 00:55.264
But some you never will.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.775
(male #1) 'You witnessed
the murder of a girl.'

01:06.984 --> 01:09.362
'Talking can help you realize
that it wasn't your fault.'

01:09.570 --> 01:12.039
That would be a neat trick.
Let's get to that part.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.286
You can start by telling me

01:13.490 --> 01:15.037
what happened that night
at Newcastle.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.539
'Do you remember the killer?'

01:16.743 --> 01:18.666
I see that demon every time
I close my eyes.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.964
By demon, you-you mean murderer?

01:21.164 --> 01:24.293
Oh, by demon,
I mean a bloody demon.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.378
A foul creature.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.884
Smelled like a slaughterhouse.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.385
You see what's happening, John?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.638
You feel guilty for being unable
to protect the girl

01:31.842 --> 01:35.472
'so you turned her killer
into the embodiment of evil.'

01:35.679 --> 01:38.478
We're all powerless
against demons.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.105
- Not all of us, chief.
- That's right.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.029
Before you checked yourself
in here three months ago

01:44.229 --> 01:47.108
you were working as an
"exorcist, demonologist

01:47.316 --> 01:50.536
and master of the dark arts?"

01:50.736 --> 01:52.909
That says master, does it?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.831
Well, I should really change
that to petty dabbler.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.659
I hate to put on airs.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.244
In any case,
you wouldn't have been able

01:58.452 --> 01:59.544
to prevent the girl's death.

01:59.745 --> 02:00.917
Astra!

02:02.664 --> 02:04.541
Her name..

02:04.750 --> 02:06.127
Was Astra.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.837
And I can handle her death.

02:08.044 --> 02:11.014
It's her damnation that's eating
me alive. Dragged to hell...

02:11.214 --> 02:12.466
John, it's time
to face the truth.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.847
Nine years old
and suffering for all eternity.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.349
The only one suffering
here is you.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.521
- That's on me, mate.
- There are no demons.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.520
So you keep telling me!

02:22.267 --> 02:24.315
Now make me believe.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.736
It's what I'm paying you for,
isn't it?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.820
(male #2) 'My goal today..'

02:33.028 --> 02:36.157
was to break my habit rituals.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.665
'Like, I make a cup of tea
and then I stir it nine times.'

02:39.868 --> 02:42.371
'And then I've got nine minutes
to drink it in.'

02:42.579 --> 02:44.923
'So it's nine sips
in nine minutes.'

02:45.123 --> 02:49.003
Everything in multiples of nine
keeps bad things away, you know?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.589
Well, today..

02:51.797 --> 02:55.142
Today I let my rituals go

02:55.342 --> 02:57.561
and nothing terrible happened.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.684
I've only stirred it once.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.684
[sobbing]

03:05.894 --> 03:08.773
[eerie music]

03:30.961 --> 03:33.635
Uh, miss, whatever
you are painting there

03:33.839 --> 03:35.841
you might wanna stop now.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.064
Miss?

03:42.264 --> 03:43.390
No.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.436
No. No, no, no.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.566
This is not my problem.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.534
Oh, bollocks.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.829
I'm addressing
the entity inside.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.157
Who are you? Tell me your name.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.959
Hear my words!

04:03.160 --> 04:04.582
[screams]

04:06.538 --> 04:08.791
In the name of the Creator,
you are hereby commanded

04:08.999 --> 04:10.125
to leave this place!

04:10.333 --> 04:12.381
By the blood of man, be not

04:12.586 --> 04:14.008
and be gone!

04:18.048 --> 04:20.552

04:40.655 --> 04:42.578

04:45.494 --> 04:48.418
Oh, don't worry, love.
It's just paint.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.169
What, what happened?

04:50.373 --> 04:52.216
A spirit took your body
for a spin.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.839
What?

04:54.044 --> 04:56.888
[dramatic music]

04:59.090 --> 05:01.684
To send me a message,
by the look of it.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.889
(female #1) 'What's it mean?'

05:05.096 --> 05:07.394
It means I've been wasting
my time here.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.524
I've got work to do.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.242
She did it.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.037
Who has a brighter future?

05:29.246 --> 05:32.170
Me or the opera lady
in the food court?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.500
- Opera lady.
- What?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.135
(Max)
No college loans to pay off.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.259
Pass me a fortune cookie.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.388
[chuckles] "Failure is the
opportunity to do better next time."

05:42.592 --> 05:44.970
- In bed.
- Huh?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.805
You always add in bed
to the end.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.310
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.392
- Let's read yours.
- 'Okay.'

05:52.686 --> 05:55.439
Great. I have no future.

05:55.647 --> 05:59.197
Aww. Here you go.
One for the road.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.698
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.575
See you in the morning.
Don't forget to lock up.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.827
- Goodnight, Liv.
- See you later. Night.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.862
- Ah!
- Well, hello.

08:04.067 --> 08:04.989
What have we here?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.412
Are you in a bit
of trouble, love?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.081
- Stay back!
- My name is John Constantine.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.660
You're pointing that
the wrong way.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.498
I promise you I'm not the one
that's hunting you.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.379
What are you talking about?
Who's hunting me?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.300
It's probably more of a what
or possibly an it.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.425
Stay away! S.. Back away, stop.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.472
- Hmm.
- Stay away.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.266
It's easier to deny danger
than to face it

08:28.466 --> 08:30.343
but make no mistake,
if you don't listen to me

08:30.510 --> 08:31.762
you'll be dead by morning.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.563
I'm calling the police.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.640
If you're so committed
to contacting the authorities

08:36.850 --> 08:39.068
then here's where
they can reach me.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.897
Or you can,
if you enjoy breathing.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.449
"Master of the dark arts?"

08:48.653 --> 08:50.781
I'm getting new ones made.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.832
[sighs]

09:06.087 --> 09:09.512
Whoever you are,
I'm a nasty piece of work.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.093
Ask anybody.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.518
[explosion]

09:17.974 --> 09:19.851
You shouldn't be down here.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.983
I could say the same about you.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.689
'You come to admire
your handiwork?'

09:23.897 --> 09:26.366
This wasn't my doing.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.944
What brings you back
to the streets, John?

09:29.152 --> 09:31.746
A young lady, of course.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.414
I was asked to protect her
by an old friend.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.912
Dead friend more likely.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
Well, he did have
to possess a body

09:36.576 --> 09:37.998
but he got my attention.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.753
- Who are you?
- You can call me Manny.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.755
- I was asked to watch over you.
- Watch over?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.382
No offense, squire, I'm not
in the habit of slumming it

09:47.587 --> 09:49.385
with angels.
You'll murder my reputation.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.182
So will a mental hospital.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.555
Yeah? Well, I checked out.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.387
I'm all better.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.393
You hear that?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.099
I'm okay!

10:00.850 --> 10:02.193
So flap off.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.191
You're not okay, John.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.903
You damned a girl to hell

10:08.108 --> 10:09.985
and along with her, your soul.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.493
Now I can't change your fate,
but I can ease your suffering.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.205
Go feed off someone else's loss.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.503
But yours is exquisite.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.330
Oh, don't worry about me, mate.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.711
I can handle a demon attack.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.337
I wouldn't be so sure.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.419
You've been out of play a while.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.049
There's a lot of panic
down here.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.552
People can sense
what's on the way.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.890
What's on the way?

10:36.094 --> 10:38.062
[police siren wailing]

10:38.263 --> 10:39.355
We should go.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.519
Wait!

10:46.437 --> 10:48.439
What's on the way?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.406
- You're a lifesaver.
- It was no problem.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.082
I work five minutes away
from you.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.706
Thanks, Talia.
I really appreciate the ride.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.585
(Talia) I'm just glad you
got away from that freak.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.257
He sounded kind of rapey.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.585
Yeah, he creeped me out.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.466
You're sure you're okay?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.388
(Liv) I'm alright, thank you.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.726
- Sleep well.
- You too. Goodnight.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.520

[indistinct
police radio chatter]

12:37.298 --> 12:39.517
- Stay in your apartment, ma'am.
- What's going on?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.560
This is an active crime scene.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.561
Oh, my God. Talia, oh, my God.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.438
Talia.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.830
Oh, Lord!

13:43.031 --> 13:44.078
Hold on, hold on, hold tight.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.785
I'm gonna get you out of there.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.620
[heavy breathing]

13:57.003 --> 13:59.381
[man screaming]

14:12.185 --> 14:14.153
(Liv) 'Thanks for the ride.'

14:19.150 --> 14:21.027
You always carpool
with the cops?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.865
My friend was killed last night.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.790
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.130
I found it on my door.
What is it?

14:33.331 --> 14:35.379
'The Eye of Horus,
it's an Egyptian symbol'

14:35.583 --> 14:37.460
of protection or so they say.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.670
'There was a man
in my hallway last night.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.801
I think he killed Talia.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.097
[banging]

14:44.175 --> 14:47.805
(John) 'Liv, meet Chas,
my oldest mate.'

14:48.012 --> 14:50.481
'He made the carving
that kept you alive.'

14:50.681 --> 14:52.524
I'm glad you're safe.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.568
Not much of a talker, that one.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.191
'Now down to business.'

14:56.396 --> 14:57.318
If we don't get you
somewhere safe

14:57.522 --> 14:58.694
bodies will just keep piling up.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.368
Why would anybody want me dead?
I'm a nobody.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.196
I hate to burst your bubble,
love, but you're not a nobody.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.079
I knew your father.
Jasper Winters.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.125
'I promised him
I'd look after you.'

15:10.326 --> 15:11.828
That's not possible.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.585
My father died
before I was born.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.666
Well, whoever told you
that was lying.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.842
Jasper died just last year.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.635
He was a good man too.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.891
Here.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.844
[sighs] Open this.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.396
It belonged to him.
He wanted you to have it.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.774
- Hey, look out!
- Aah!'

15:37.979 --> 15:39.481
[glass shattering]

15:42.316 --> 15:44.193
- Is everybody okay?
- Everybody, out!

15:44.402 --> 15:45.870
- 'Chas, get them out.'
- Come on!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.447
That thing could blow.
Get out of here.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.162
That's my desk.
I should've been sitting here.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.993
Whatever's after you
must be able to track you.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.919
Feel your energy.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.793
'It won't give up
until you're dead.'

15:57.790 --> 16:00.669
[heavy breathing]

16:04.255 --> 16:05.472
Oh, my God.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.767
Talia.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.095
- She's alive.
- No, she's not.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.556
Something's using her.
This is all wrong.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.812
They never operate
in the open like this.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.398
Who are you? Who sent you?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.025
[groans]

16:27.278 --> 16:30.157
- Liv?
- Gone.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.456
Brilliant.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.876
(Liv) Mom, look me in the
eye and tell me again.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.457
When did my dad die?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.885
I'm not prepared
to have this conversation.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.712
You denied me a father
my entire life.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.674
I don't care what you wanna
talk about right now.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.225
Who was he?

16:49.425 --> 16:52.429
He was just some boy
that I met at a concert

16:52.637 --> 16:54.935
and he had no interest in
seeing you after you were born.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.062
And Lord knows your nana,
rest her soul

16:57.266 --> 16:58.188
she didn't encourage it.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.393
A friend of his tracked me down.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.603
Well, I don't see how.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.358
Jasper didn't even know
where we live.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.565
(Liv) 'The man I met said
this belonged to him.'

17:04.773 --> 17:06.526
Have you ever seen it?

17:10.655 --> 17:12.328
Liv, what is it?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.292
Nana.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.618
[grunts]

17:16.827 --> 17:18.204
[gasps]

17:18.412 --> 17:20.915
Liv. Honey!

17:21.123 --> 17:22.045
What's wrong? Liv!

17:27.171 --> 17:29.594
- What is happening to me?
- You're waking up.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.847
You're seeing the world
for what it really is.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.270
- Just like your father could.
- Which means what?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.893
[sighs] Impatience.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.648
The psychic disease
of the 21st century.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.853
Where's the pendant?

17:45.356 --> 17:46.983
Look around.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.535
[dramatic music]

18:01.706 --> 18:04.300
- What are they?
- Souls.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.595
Trapped.
Searching for a way out.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.676
- Can you see them?
- No.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.725
What else do you see?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.059
[train whistling]

18:19.223 --> 18:22.898
- There's a train coming.
- Ls there?

18:23.102 --> 18:26.447
Look, what are you doing?
There's a train coming.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.866
Let go of me. Let go.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.943
What are you doing?
There's a train coming.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.160
We have to get off the tracks!
Let go!

18:35.364 --> 18:37.162
Let go of me!

18:52.506 --> 18:54.634
What just happened?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.014
Ghost train.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.061
How come I can see these things?

18:58.262 --> 19:00.264
It appears
you have your father's gift.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.521
When you touch his necklace,
it focuses your ability

19:02.725 --> 19:04.272
to see what he saw.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.024
'There are worlds beyond ours.'

19:06.228 --> 19:08.572
Parallel planes of existence.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.322
Jasper tried to teach me,
but, uh..

19:11.525 --> 19:12.868
I didn't have his knack.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.618
Oh, so you were close.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.994
We can talk later.
Right now we're prey.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.826
Leave your car at your mum's.
You're coming with us.

19:20.034 --> 19:24.585
# Oh it's 6 in the morning #

19:24.789 --> 19:28.419
# A brand-new day
is set to begin #

19:32.380 --> 19:34.257
John was going to tell me
about Jasper.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.808
I wanna know how he died.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.894
Bravely.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.722
- You were there?
- That's enough of that.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.352
(Liv) 'I was just thinking
that whatever's after me'

19:42.556 --> 19:45.526
maybe it wants revenge
for something my father did.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.854
I'm not concerned with the why.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.530
I just wanna send it packing

19:49.730 --> 19:51.528
square my debt
with your dad and be done.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.858
# I've never been.. #

19:53.067 --> 19:55.320
'Turn it down.'

19:55.528 --> 19:56.996
I can't.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.166
# ...if that's okay #

20:03.452 --> 20:04.328
Chas!

20:04.537 --> 20:05.629
[horn honking]

20:11.669 --> 20:13.546
[echoing] John?

20:13.754 --> 20:16.132
- Astra?
- It's following me.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.217
Make it go away.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.518
Please.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.056
Come here. I've got you.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.141
You can't have her!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.397
You can't save her.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.774
You can't have her!
You can't have her!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.947
John, get me out of here!

20:34.859 --> 20:36.156
[screaming]

20:38.112 --> 20:39.489
(Liv)
'John, get us out of here!'

20:39.697 --> 20:40.573
[gasping]

20:40.781 --> 20:42.533
'Help us!'

20:42.742 --> 20:44.585
[grunts]

20:45.870 --> 20:46.871
'John, help us!'

20:47.079 --> 20:49.582
My foot's jammed under!

20:49.790 --> 20:51.508
Do something! Please!

20:51.709 --> 20:53.677
Alright, keep your hair on.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.346
(Liv) Oh!

20:55.546 --> 20:57.389
[explosion]

20:58.883 --> 21:00.009
[grunts]

21:09.393 --> 21:10.986
The sacred cross commands you.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.610
The Star of David commands you.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.237
The Omkar, the Lotus,
the Shahada command you.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444
Flee this place.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.120
Flee this place!

21:20.321 --> 21:22.244
Disperges in ventum!

21:22.448 --> 21:24.371
Be not and be gone!

21:26.035 --> 21:28.129
I think I got it.
Get her out of there, Chas!

21:28.329 --> 21:30.297
The Omkar, the Lotus,
the Shahada command you.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.967
The Omkar, the Lotus,
the Shahada command you.

21:33.167 --> 21:36.216
The Omkar, the Lotus,
the Shahada command you.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.343
John, here.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.595
Go!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.019
Chas, look out!

21:43.219 --> 21:44.971
- No! No!
- No.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.568
There are millions of demons.

21:51.769 --> 21:52.816
We need to figure out
which one of them

21:52.978 --> 21:54.355
has you marked for death.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.440
Don't worry, we'll be safe here.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.822
Are you kidding? After what
just happened to Chas?

21:59.026 --> 22:01.120
Things aren't always what
they appear to be, love.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.412
You wanna make it out
of this alive

22:02.613 --> 22:03.785
you need to understand that.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.206
I don't understand half
of what you're saying.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.000
Do you ever say anything
clearly?

22:07.201 --> 22:09.124
This house belonged
to your father.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.878
If this day ever came,
I promised him

22:13.082 --> 22:17.212
that I would put these keys
in your hands.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.217
'Is that clear enough for you?'

22:21.382 --> 22:23.760
Jasper stayed here now
and then to watch over you.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.891
But he had to keep his distance

22:26.095 --> 22:28.314
'for your safety naturally.'

22:28.514 --> 22:30.312
There's nothing natural
about this.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.452
(Liv) 'This is insane!'

22:42.653 --> 22:45.031
'You could survive
an apocalypse down here.'

22:45.239 --> 22:46.536
Yeah, or start one.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.789
Jasper used this place
for divination.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.964
No one could find trouble
faster than your father.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.460
'Literally.'

22:59.628 --> 23:02.598
'Oh, I'd put that down, love,
before it puts you down.'

23:02.798 --> 23:03.890
[sighs]

23:13.726 --> 23:16.070
(Liv) 'This looks like
a map of Atlanta.'

23:16.270 --> 23:19.194
'What's with these locations?
Illusion Falls?'

23:19.398 --> 23:21.571
Jasper taught himself
cartography.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.198
Started drawing his own maps
based on what he saw.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.280
You said that
he could find trouble?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.786
It's called scrying.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.914
Hold your pendant over a map,
you'll see.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.212
Ah! Here it is.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.538
I found the demon
that's hunting you.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.342
Goes by the name of Furcifer.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.637
That bloody angel was right.
The stakes are rising.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.056
- What angel?
- 'Keep your eyes on the map.'

23:44.256 --> 23:47.100
Furcifer draws its strength
from electricity.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.724
It can manifest lightning
and tempests.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.311
That's how it could control
the power lines

23:53.515 --> 23:55.609
and the dead bodies.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.903
- Ow! Ow!
- Uh, h-h-hold it!

23:58.103 --> 23:59.605
(John) 'Let the blood drop.'

24:04.526 --> 24:06.824
(Liv)
'Oh, my God, what is that?'

24:07.029 --> 24:09.202
What you asked for. Trouble.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.454
Edgewood Avenue. So, what, like,
something bad's happening here?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.882
- Will happen.
- We have to do something.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.584
We are, alright?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.466
We're keeping you alive.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.672
See, I have an idea to cut
your attacker down to size

24:24.880 --> 24:28.475
but... it means
using you as bait.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.445
Can I help you, sir?

24:44.274 --> 24:45.446
You know, it's a fine line

24:45.651 --> 24:48.200
between watching over
and stalking.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.327
I was right, wasn't I?

24:50.531 --> 24:51.657
It's heating up down here.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.538
Can you open the gate, please?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.870
I've got time pressures.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.308
Well..

25:19.977 --> 25:21.320
This is new.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.235
Hmm.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.239
(Manny) 'Did you find out
what's hunting the girl?'

25:32.448 --> 25:34.075
A demon from the inner circle.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.206
Really?

25:36.410 --> 25:37.662
You know, a thing like that
can't make its way

25:37.870 --> 25:39.213
here without serious help.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.415
You know what, it feels to me
like you want me

25:41.623 --> 25:43.170
to find out
some information for you.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.377
- I do.
- Why?

25:45.586 --> 25:47.133
If you figure out
what we're up against

25:47.337 --> 25:50.011
I will use that knowledge
to save lives.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.013
And what about my life, eh?

25:52.217 --> 25:54.811
You and yours damned me to hell.

25:56.847 --> 26:01.398
So... why should I risk
my last days on earth?

26:01.560 --> 26:04.063
Why, indeed.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.649
You're a sideshow attraction.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.450
A peddler of shabby magic.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.572
Hang on a minute...

26:09.777 --> 26:11.074
Your decisions are questionable

26:11.278 --> 26:12.780
at best, and without conscience.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.413
Why should you risk
what time you have left?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.794
Because you are damned to hell.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.625
At least for the moment, anyway.

26:28.003 --> 26:31.007
Are you suggesting
that it's not too late for me..

26:31.215 --> 26:33.309
To save my soul?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.223
Are you alright, sir?

26:40.891 --> 26:43.144
No.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.854
'Not even slightly.'

26:59.409 --> 27:01.582
[knock on door]

27:01.787 --> 27:05.087
Hello, Ritchie. Long time, eh?

27:05.290 --> 27:07.668
You get yourself
out of my office right now!

27:07.876 --> 27:08.718
Go on, get out!

27:08.919 --> 27:10.136
Is that any way to greet a mate?

27:10.337 --> 27:11.680
Alright, you know what?
Never mind. Never mind.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.848
You-you can stay.
You can stay. I'll get out.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.551
You still trolling the internet

27:15.759 --> 27:18.558
for things that go
bump in the night?

27:18.762 --> 27:21.311
A celestial type said
something big's on its way.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.397
If I tell you, will you leave?

27:31.108 --> 27:32.951
Alright, alright. Yes.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.995
Yes, I have been data-mining

27:35.195 --> 27:37.163
a whole lot
of unexplained phenomenon.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.583
Police reports, chat rooms,
news wires and I can..

27:39.783 --> 27:42.457
[laughs]
I can guarantee you, things

27:42.661 --> 27:43.913
things are crawling
out of the shadows

27:44.121 --> 27:46.465
on a scale we've never seen
before, John.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.463
That includes a demon
from the inner circle

27:48.667 --> 27:51.762
that's terrorizing
Jasper's daughter.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.636
I need your help, old son.
Can you hack a power grid?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.434
Can I hack a power..
Why, yes, I can do that.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.602
And I believe
I'll take a pass on that.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.100
I know that Newcastle
was a bodge job.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.605
Newcastle was a nightmare, John!
It was a nightmare!

28:04.808 --> 28:07.152
Everything that happened to
that girl. And you know what?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.605
'Now I can't even make it
through one day'

28:09.813 --> 28:12.612
without Oxy to dull the pain,
diazepam to make me sleep

28:12.816 --> 28:15.695
and I will only get out of bed
for my now dangerously

28:15.903 --> 28:17.621
good friend dextroamphetamine.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.789
We all learnt our lessons,
Ritchie.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.992
Hmm, you know,
the coppers in Newcastle

28:22.201 --> 28:25.751
are still searching for the man
that murdered Astra.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.206
You know it wasn't a man.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.132
But they don't know that,
do they?

28:32.336 --> 28:34.088
Oh, it would be a real shame

28:34.296 --> 28:36.048
if someone tipped them off
you were there.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.261
Not like you really have
an alibi for that night.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.561
[chuckles]

28:43.805 --> 28:48.151
You know, l... wish it would
have been you, John.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.399
No, really.

28:49.603 --> 28:52.527
I really wish Nergal had just

28:52.731 --> 28:54.574
gone in and taken you instead.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.786
That makes the two of us, mate.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.289
[sighs]

29:05.494 --> 29:06.586
[gasps]

29:10.624 --> 29:11.671
[gasps]

29:24.972 --> 29:26.724
You hungry? I brought groceries.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.606
I saw a man in the mirror
over the fireplace.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.938
- Is that...
- Jasper? Sounds like him.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.988
Is that his... ghost?

29:34.189 --> 29:37.113
No. Time's out of joint
in that mirror.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.569
You were watching the past.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.245
You'll find lots
of dodgy business like that

29:40.445 --> 29:41.867
in this place. Here.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.289
I grabbed some clothes for you.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.496
What, how did you get
into my apartment?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.795
' Liv? ' Aah!

29:47.995 --> 29:49.497
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm, I'm alright.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.083
- Sorry to startle you.
- But you're..

29:52.291 --> 29:54.293
You, you died.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.300
Not exactly. It's complicated.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.178
(John) There's a reason
Chas is my oldest friend.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.759
He has survival skills.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.095
No, no, nobody can survive
what I saw.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.305
Excellent,
if you're not confused

30:06.513 --> 30:08.060
you're not paying attention.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.484
Now time for your famous
rack of lamb.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.937
One should never battle demons
on an empty stomach.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.614
Wait. We're going
after that thing tonight?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.691
Live in the now, I always say.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.740
Three hundred, four hundred,
five hundred dollars.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.872
Just to have sex on a rooftop?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.544
Come on, let's go.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.168
- She's on fire tonight.
- Ah.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.589
There's one more vital detail.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.884
There's an extra 100
in it for you

30:36.084 --> 30:38.257
if you keep this by your side.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.557
If it glows,
you call me immediately.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.680
It's not screwed into anything.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.932
Neither am I, mate.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.979
(Liv) 'What is it?'

30:52.184 --> 30:53.777
A demon seal.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.153
Did you get it off the internet?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.530
[chuckles]

31:00.734 --> 31:03.829
No, this one's
a proprietary design.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.624
Triangle of Solomon with some
Elder Runes and Enochian script.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.873
When Furcifer comes for you,
it'll have to enter the circle.

31:11.078 --> 31:14.457
The seal will hold it and then
I can order it to hell.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.962
Well, that should do it.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.885
It's time.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.134
You need to enter the circle.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.507
[music on PSP]

31:25.342 --> 31:27.310
No! No!

31:27.511 --> 31:28.854
It's my high score!

31:34.643 --> 31:36.361
Where do you come from, John?

31:36.561 --> 31:38.404
The sordid passions
of my parents.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.360
- You do that a lot, you know.
- 'Oh, what's that?'

31:42.567 --> 31:45.867
- Deflect emotions with humor.
- Do I?

31:46.071 --> 31:48.995
Come on, John. I'm trusting
you with my life here.

31:49.199 --> 31:53.295
The least you can do is to share
one small personal detail.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.748
My mom died giving birth to me.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.552
Or one big detail.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.470
My dad said it was my fault.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.683
He had a nickname for me.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.885
I heard it every night.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.846
"Hey there, killer."

32:11.054 --> 32:13.807
'And after a night in the pub,
which was every night'

32:14.015 --> 32:15.983
he'd, uh, punch my head and say

32:16.184 --> 32:18.937
"That's for what you did
to your mother, killer."

32:20.480 --> 32:22.528
Do you sometimes wonder
what your mom was like?

32:22.732 --> 32:25.201
There's no point wondering.
I'm gonna find her.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.205
When I was a teenager,
I started reading

32:28.405 --> 32:29.998
every book I could find
on the occult.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.826
I taught myself
spells, rituals, curses.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.958
I learned to conjure
all kinds of dead things.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.710
Just not her.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.463
Not yet.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.920
Not yet.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.673
Get ready.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.722
[door opens]

32:51.678 --> 32:53.601
(John) 'I told you to
call my cell phone.'

32:53.805 --> 32:56.308
You really don't wanna
be up here.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.768
Oh, yes, he does.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.355
That's not the guard.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.949
[thunder rumbling]

33:12.491 --> 33:14.414
Steady, Liv.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.087
'You killed
that nice gentleman.'

33:17.287 --> 33:19.085
I should have seen
that one coming.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.667
Oh, do you want her, chief?
Come and get her.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.356
Furcifer de hoc mundo exisse.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.938
In nomine Dei iuberis.

in nomine Dei iuberis.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.493
[groaning]

34:00.038 --> 34:03.963
Nergal said your rituals
lack the power of intention.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.465
How does it feel, Constantine

34:06.670 --> 34:09.514
to lock eyes with your future?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.308
It's a bit unsettling,
to be honest, mate.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.226
It's not my best look.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.931
It's only a matter of time
before you belong to us.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.982
Hell must be short on souls
if you're bothering

34:20.183 --> 34:21.730
with a sorry one like mine.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.030
On the contrary,
we rely on you to provide us

34:25.230 --> 34:27.197
with a fresh supply.

34:27.399 --> 34:31.245
Everyone who stands
at your side dies.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.074
And tonight..

34:35.282 --> 34:36.625
It's your turn.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.701
[explosion]

Liv, run!

34:42.831 --> 34:44.047
John!

34:44.248 --> 34:45.341
Your arrogance brought me

34:45.542 --> 34:47.670
to the heart of a city at night.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.255
[Liv grunting]

34:50.422 --> 34:52.299
[thunder rumbling]

34:55.217 --> 34:57.516
[inhales] In this place..

34:59.014 --> 35:01.608
I'm God!

35:01.808 --> 35:03.025
I almost forgot.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.193
[gunshot]

35:10.191 --> 35:12.239
I hope this works, John.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.410
[beeping]

35:15.614 --> 35:17.787
[electricity shuts down]

35:25.290 --> 35:27.839
- What's this?
- The power of intention.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.887
[intense music]

35:38.386 --> 35:40.263
[Liv grunts]

John, is that you?

35:56.363 --> 35:57.785
'John.'

35:57.989 --> 35:59.707
Astra.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.536
Please get me out of here.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.872
(Furcifer as John)
Do you hear her, John?

36:05.080 --> 36:07.333
The girl's in pain.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.668
Are you really
gonna fail her again

36:09.876 --> 36:13.176
'like you failed
so many others?'

36:13.380 --> 36:16.179
Release me and her soul is free.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.689
I'm sorry.

[heavy breathing]

[indistinct chanting]

36:36.194 --> 36:37.867
Stop, John! It's not Astra.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.789
It's not her!

36:44.285 --> 36:46.913
Oh, you think
you can mess with my life?

36:47.122 --> 36:48.624
Well, I got news for you, mate!

36:50.333 --> 36:52.631
I'm coming for Astra.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.930
And then I'm coming for Nergal!

36:55.130 --> 36:57.098
And you can pass that along!

36:57.298 --> 36:59.221
In hell!

vivorum et mortuorum!

37:32.041 --> 37:33.088
Are you okay?

37:34.919 --> 37:36.921
I have a colleague down there.
He'll drive you home.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.722
Go.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.024
(Liv) Who's Astra?

37:56.232 --> 37:59.236
She was the daughter of a friend
of ours in Newcastle, England.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.622
A demon possessed her.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.917
John went ahead
on his own and he..

38:06.117 --> 38:08.961
Decided to conjure up
a more powerful demon.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.163
Nergal.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.624
He said he was just gonna..

38:12.832 --> 38:15.551
Order it to drag
the lesser demon away.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.925
- But it took Astra instead?
- Yeah.

right in front of us.

stay away from him, Liv.

would do this to a boy?'

head, you'd probably say'

the Supremes or something. I can
understand what you mean with..

39:03.216 --> 39:06.140
Oh, Chas,
just in time to settle a bet.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.267
The most influential band.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.473
Barkeep here reckons
the Ramones for the music

39:10.682 --> 39:13.151
which is, well, it's fair
enough, but the Pistols..

39:13.351 --> 39:16.321
Come on, man, the Pistols,
they were dangerous.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.570
Liv stopped by the mill house
to get her bags.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.243
Said something about a cousin
in California.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.749
She's isn't coming back, John.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.332
Hmm.

39:32.996 --> 39:36.091
Guess we're not all cut
from the same cloth.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.838
Is she safe out there?

39:38.042 --> 39:39.385
She will be.

39:39.586 --> 39:43.181
With Furcifer gone, I can put
a cloaking spell on her.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.931
Yeah, before she left, Liv spent
an hour in the map room

39:47.135 --> 39:48.432
'scrying like you taught her.'

39:48.636 --> 39:50.638
Look. It's happening everywhere.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.526
She wants you to keep fighting.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.195
She sounded a lot like her
father when she said it too.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.772
Did she now? Hmm.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.864
Maybe you'll never forgive
yourself for what happened

40:04.068 --> 40:07.743
to Astra, but if you wanna
give her loss some meaning

40:07.947 --> 40:10.245
then do something about it.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.261
Cheers. Interesting coincidence.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.312
Ritchie had to drive
20 blocks out of the way

40:31.512 --> 40:34.937
to pass Edgewood Avenue and
stumble onto that crime scene.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.485
Hmm. He made me pay for gas.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.150
You scared her away.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.949
[clicks tongue]
Kind of the point, mate.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.072
I work better alone.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.449
You fail to grasp
the stakes here, John.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.622
Liv's power is valuable.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.790
So is her life.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.243
If Liv was gonna join our fight

40:53.451 --> 40:55.795
she had the right to see
the risks for herself.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.838
All I did was..

40:58.039 --> 40:59.507
Give her a choice

40:59.707 --> 41:01.801
which is more than Astra
ever had.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.423
You said our fight.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.507
That mean
you're going to help us?

41:07.715 --> 41:10.844
[smacks lips] Well, that's
what you wanted, isn't it?

41:11.052 --> 41:14.352
[chuckles]
And you call me a con man.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.603
Pick up the tab, will you?

41:16.808 --> 41:17.900
You bastards are gonna owe me.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.719
and spit on them
when they're down

41:44.919 --> 41:48.264
leaving only a nod
and a wink and a wisecrack.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.556
[guns cocking]

41:51.509 --> 41:53.386
I walk my path alone

41:53.594 --> 41:55.642
because, let's be honest..

41:55.847 --> 41:58.600
[gasps]

41:58.808 --> 42:01.186
Who would be crazy
enough to walk it with me?

42:27.920 --> 42:30.799
[theme music]
