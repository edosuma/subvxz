it goes from there.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.963
Sound good?

24:47.137 --> 24:49.357
Fine. Fine. Okay. Fine.[chuckles]

24:57.757 --> 24:58.888
JIMMY [over phone]:
You've reached Jimmy McKay.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.150
Please leave a message.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.371
Okay.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.810
Enlarge 400%.[typing]

25:11.335 --> 25:14.513
Call The Villa Rosa Hotel.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.041
[grunts]

25:21.215 --> 25:22.738
The monitors are down.
No one's even in there.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.435
I guess he wasn't lying
when he said

25:24.610 --> 25:25.915
he shut down the security
system for the night.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.134
Maybe I can pick the lock.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.048
[metal scrapes]

25:30.267 --> 25:30.964
Walk away.What?

25:31.138 --> 25:32.618
Just do it.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.972
Dude, where the hell
have you been?

25:39.146 --> 25:40.103
You were supposed to be here
ten minutes ago.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.844
Excuse me?

25:42.018 --> 25:44.238
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.805
I asked the guy at the front
desk to send a janitor.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.633
I-I didn't mean
to freak out on you.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.635
Okay? I-It's just,
I'm Mr. McKay's new assistant

25:49.809 --> 25:52.942
Max Parish, and he,
like, went crazy on me

25:53.116 --> 25:54.640
because he left his wallet
in the security room yesterday,

25:54.814 --> 25:56.642
as if it's my fault, right?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.078
And now he's insisting I get
it back, and I have no idea

25:58.252 --> 25:59.688
how to get in there,
and now my job's on the line.

25:59.862 --> 26:00.428
Look, I'm seriously
gonna get fired, okay?

26:00.602 --> 26:02.517
Dude, it's fine.

26:02.691 --> 26:03.866
[exhales]Been there. Been there.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.955

I really appreciate it.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.175
[beeps]

26:20.622 --> 26:21.580
Sorry, this is gonna
take me a minute.

26:21.754 --> 26:22.798
You don't have
to stick around.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.672
JANITOR:
Oh, uh, I don't know.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.674
MAX:
Don't worry, if anyone gives
you a hard time about this,

26:28.848 --> 26:30.414
I'll tell them you were
helping out Mr. McKay.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.112
Um, all right.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.027
Thank you.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.346
DARNELL:Felix, we got to
make this quick.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.000
We can't miss
the exchange.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.219
What's the room number again?

26:52.349 --> 26:53.699
Uh, uh, 2120.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.795
[brakes screech]

27:17.287 --> 27:18.941
I guess you do know him.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.856

27:46.055 --> 27:47.535
Yes.[laughs]

27:47.709 --> 27:49.537
Just-just make sure
it's recording, okay?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.974
Yeah, you think I didn't make
sure it's recording, Darnell?

27:52.148 --> 27:53.454
Guys, shut up, it's happening.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.568
Where the hell are you, D?

28:26.879 --> 28:28.358
[door thuds]

28:31.144 --> 28:33.842
SARAH:
Chicago PD. Nobody move!

28:34.016 --> 28:35.670
Trey Williams, you're under
arrest for the manufacturing

28:35.801 --> 28:38.238
and distribution
of illegal narcotics.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.071
Good to see you, Trey.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.552
Darnell sends his regards.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.384
Let's go. Let's go.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.696
[phone buzzes]

29:04.481 --> 29:06.832
Trey's been arrested.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.356
And McKay is handing
over the pills.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.574
[laughs softly]

29:10.705 --> 29:12.751
You guys,
it's actually over.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.187
[exhales]

29:14.361 --> 29:15.797

JOSH:
Listen to me.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.846
I'm with the Chicago
Police Department.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.718
Yes. You have
to find Jimmy McKay.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.242
No, no, no, no, no.
It's an urgent matter.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.854
No, no, you can't
put me on hold again.

29:29.028 --> 29:29.593
WOMAN: Please hold.[phone beeps]

29:29.768 --> 29:30.943

29:36.513 --> 29:38.254
JIMMY:
Yep, it's all there.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.430
And you can count it if
you like. 500 grand worth.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.607
Now where were we?

29:43.738 --> 29:44.783
Oh, maybe another time.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.089
I should really get this
to my boyfriend.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.309
Well, but-but-but
I thought, uh...

29:49.483 --> 29:51.659
[laughs]:
I know.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.313
It would've been so fun.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.575
[chuckles]:Yeah.[phone ringing]

29:54.749 --> 29:57.404
Uh... Oh, um... Oh...

29:57.578 --> 29:59.188
Hang on a second.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.541
Hello?

30:04.715 --> 30:06.761
JOSH:
Is this Jimmy McKay?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.241
Yeah. Who's this?

30:08.415 --> 30:10.112
Joshua Wallace.

30:10.286 --> 30:13.115
Who?Look, you don't know me,

30:13.289 --> 30:15.117
but there's something
you'll want to hear.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.032
I'm guessing
you're with Murphy Mason.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.039
JIMMY: Thank you so much
for letting me know. Yeah.

30:24.213 --> 30:25.867
You have a good night.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.869
Thank you. Bye.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.218

30:31.525 --> 30:32.787
MAX:
Who was that on the phone?

30:32.918 --> 30:34.876
I don't know.Why isn't she leaving?

30:35.007 --> 30:38.445
Okay, well, I should
get out of here.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.056
Oh, no, no, no.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.058
No, you're not moving.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.802
I know what
you're really doing here.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.152
And what am I really doing?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.678
Who just called you?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.465
Don't worry about it.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.385
Come on, get up.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.256
Go. Go.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.911
JIMMY:This is not gonna
end well for you.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.739
This is not gonna
end well for you.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.307
[chuckles]:
Oh, yeah. Me?

31:14.481 --> 31:17.527
I can get rid of this.
It's your word against mine.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.660
I'm pretty sure my friends
turned your cameras on.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.750
And you already handed
over the pills to me,

31:22.924 --> 31:24.621
so it actually isn't

31:24.795 --> 31:27.711
your word against mine.
[laughs softly]

31:28.756 --> 31:30.410
How could you do this to me?

31:30.540 --> 31:31.977
[chuckles]

31:32.151 --> 31:33.630
It was pretty easy.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.197
Yeah. Men are stupid.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.417
And how you convinced
everyone you were

31:37.591 --> 31:40.637
the superior sex for so long,
it's, uh, it's truly baffling.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.552
Don't get cute with me.

31:42.726 --> 31:43.989
But me being cute is the reason
why you're in this mess.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.078
Isn't it?Do you understand

31:46.208 --> 31:47.427
what is going to happen to me?

31:47.557 --> 31:48.776
Do you?Yeah.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.604
I do. That's sort of
the whole point.

31:50.778 --> 31:51.866
'Cause for you this whole
thing was about money.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.389
Easy way to
make a buck.

31:53.563 --> 31:57.393
But you and Trey,
you killed people.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.656
You killed people,
my friend Chloe

31:59.787 --> 32:00.875
almost being one of them.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.051
So cry me a river, okay?

32:07.142 --> 32:08.883
DARNELL:
What are they arguing about?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
Why is he looking at us?

32:14.584 --> 32:16.456
It's over.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.718
Yeah.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.677
Yeah, it's over.
