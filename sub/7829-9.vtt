<i>and scrimshaw.</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:39.305
<i>Thus, I submit to you</i>
<i>we abolish television...</i>

10:39.388 --> 10:40.681
<i>permanently.</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:43.434
Go back to Massachusetts,
pinko.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.644
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
<i>I've stolen a nuclear weapon.</i>

10:46.812 --> 10:50.858
<i>If you do not rid this city</i>
<i>of television within two hours,</i>

10:50.941 --> 10:52.526
<i>I will detonate it.</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:53.527
<i>Farewell.</i>

10:53.611 --> 10:56.489
(clamoring)

10:56.572 --> 10:59.533
<i>By the way, I'm aware</i>
<i>of the irony of appearing on TV</i>

10:59.617 --> 11:03.079
<i>in order to decry it, so don't</i>
<i>bother pointing that out.</i>

11:03.162 --> 11:05.206
(siren blaring)

11:05.289 --> 11:06.582
Kids, everything's
gonna be okay!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.292
Don't panic!
Just don't panic!

11:08.376 --> 11:09.960
Mom, Mom! You're
stepping on my heels

11:10.044 --> 11:11.712
and knocking my shoes off!

11:11.796 --> 11:13.255
We can always get more shoes.
Move, move, move!

11:16.008 --> 11:18.302
Stamp your hand
for re-entry.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.847
Hey...

11:21.931 --> 11:25.810
Cool. I want to be around when
those guns start going off.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.228
Bart, no!

11:28.604 --> 11:30.856
Wait! Wait, my children
are in there!

11:30.940 --> 11:32.858
You must be
very proud, ma'am.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.989
Our city will not negotiate
with terrorists.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.450
Is there a city nearby
that will?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.535
No need, sir.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.036
We'll find that head case

11:44.120 --> 11:46.038
faster than Garfield
finds lasagna.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.041
Oh... I'm sorry.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.835
My wife thought
that was gangbusters.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.677
This elevator only goes
to the basement,

11:59.760 --> 12:03.139
and someone made
an awful mess down there.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.020
Watch out!
He's got his probe!

12:10.104 --> 12:12.273
(imitating airplane)

12:12.356 --> 12:13.983
(imitating machine gun)

12:14.066 --> 12:15.943
Bart! Bart!

12:16.026 --> 12:18.195
What are you doing?
We've got to get out of here.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.448
Target sighted.
Launching air-to-nerd missile.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.158
Oww! Come on!

12:22.241 --> 12:23.909
Mom and Dad are waiting.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.870
Bob is not here.

12:25.953 --> 12:29.039
We have searched
every square inch of this base

12:29.123 --> 12:31.876
and all we have found
is porno, porno, porno!

12:33.544 --> 12:35.421
We have only 20 minutes left.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.923
Send in the esteemed
representatives of television.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.345
Hey, hey!

12:43.429 --> 12:45.681
Now, this is
my kind of meeting.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.894
Gentlemen, it's time we face up
to the un-face-up-to-able.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.520
We must sacrifice television

12:51.604 --> 12:54.690
in order to save the lives
of our townspeople.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.067
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

12:57.151 --> 12:58.944
Let's not go nuts.

12:59.028 --> 13:03.157
Would it really be worth living
in a world without television?

13:03.240 --> 13:06.118
I think the survivors
would envy the dead.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.123
I appreciate your passion
on behalf of your medium,

13:11.207 --> 13:13.542
but I'm afraid
we're out of options.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.961
Television must go.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.215
May God have mercy
on our souls.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.888
(screaming, cars collide)

13:25.971 --> 13:27.848
<i>And as my final newscast</i>
<i>draws to a close</i>

13:27.932 --> 13:29.350
<i>I'm reminded of a few</i>
<i>of the events</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:31.101
<i>that brought me</i>
<i>closer to you--</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:32.603
<i>The collapse of</i>
<i>the Soviet Union,</i>

13:32.686 --> 13:34.688
<i>premium ice</i>
<i>cream price wars,</i>

13:34.772 --> 13:36.941
<i>dogs that were mistakenly</i>
<i>issued major credit cards,</i>

13:37.024 --> 13:38.984
<i>and others</i>
<i>who weren't so lucky.</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:41.821
<i>And so... farewell.</i>

13:41.904 --> 13:44.490
<i>And, uh, don't forget</i>
<i>to look for my...</i>

13:44.573 --> 13:46.408
<i>new column</i>
<i>in</i> PC World <i>magazine.</i>

13:50.162 --> 13:51.413
<i>Muchas gracias, amigos</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:53.415
<i>por todas las memorias</i>

13:53.499 --> 13:56.168
<i>y super gracias a Goya!</i>

13:58.420 --> 13:59.505
Success!

13:59.588 --> 14:01.423
They're giving in!

14:01.507 --> 14:02.842
Blast!

14:02.925 --> 14:05.761
I should have
made more demands.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.013
Some decent local marmalade,
for one.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.014
Oh, well. Next time.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.308
Agh! Not my Extendo-Glove!

14:11.392 --> 14:13.185
Oh, they haven't made those
since the war.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.522
Oh! Not my Paris backdrop.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.024
How am I going
to make fun of the frogs?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.819
(sobs)

14:21.902 --> 14:25.030
Wait. If I could
only stay on the air,

14:25.114 --> 14:27.324
I'd have a hundred percent
of the audience.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.869
Think of the ratings.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.164
Okay, so we can't
go over the fence.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.791
I feel so helpless.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.626
What if something
happens to them?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.628
I'm sure they're
fine, honey.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.922
Well, at least they're
wearing clean underwear.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.929
Free and easy, Lis.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.056
There's nothing like
an unfurnished basement

14:51.140 --> 14:52.474
for pure comfort.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.518
Huh? Hurry up.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.061
Mom and Dad are
probably worried sick.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.024
You know what really frosts
my Kelvinator?

15:00.107 --> 15:02.818
That fruit cup's probably
still laughing at us

15:02.902 --> 15:04.194
from his damn
hidey hole.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.280
I'd rather take an order
from Bill Clinton

15:06.363 --> 15:09.366
than hear that guy's snooty
high-toned voice again, sir.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.201
High-toned voice.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.329
Bart, that's it.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.122
I know where Sideshow
Bob is hiding.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.584
(panting) When Bob broadcast
that message,

15:18.667 --> 15:19.835
his voice was higher
than normal,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.754
and what makes
your voice high?

15:21.837 --> 15:23.255
Tight binding underwear?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.590
Helium!

15:24.673 --> 15:26.467
Sideshow Bob is
in the Duff blimp.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.305
(constricted voice)
All Springfield trembles

15:31.388 --> 15:34.266
before the might
of Sideshow Bob.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.143
Blasted helium.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.436
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.897
Ah-hah! That's better.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.899
Gone. Gone too.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.318
Fabulous. Marvelous.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.154
<i>This is the</i>
<i>Emergency Broadcast System.</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:48.906
<i>Stand by for an urgent</i>

15:48.989 --> 15:50.240
KRUSTY:

15:50.324 --> 15:52.326
<i>(goofy laugh)</i>

15:52.409 --> 15:54.662

15:54.745 --> 15:57.039
<i>Eight... no, no!</i>
<i>12 hours a day!</i>

15:57.122 --> 15:59.375
<i>The only game in town.</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:01.961
Krusty? But how?

16:02.044 --> 16:04.755
Coming at you live
from the civil defense shack

16:04.838 --> 16:08.467
in the remote alkali flats
of the Springfield badlands.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.637
I'll be beaming out
11 watts of wackiness.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
Hour after hour

16:13.430 --> 16:16.266
<i>of unscripted, unrehearsed</i>
<i>comedy featuring...</i>

16:16.350 --> 16:19.311
<i>uh, you know...</i>
<i>Professor Gas Can</i>

16:19.395 --> 16:23.691
<i>uh... and, uh, former</i>
<i>President Ike Eisenhower.</i>

16:23.774 --> 16:26.026
<i>Let's get busy.</i>

16:26.110 --> 16:30.197
Oh, my utopia lies in ruins.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.908
How naive of me
to think a mere atom bomb

16:32.992 --> 16:35.953
could fell
the chattering cyclops.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.751
(both gasping)

16:42.835 --> 16:45.170
Well, at least
I'll have my revenge.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.797
Bob, no!

16:46.880 --> 16:49.675
Don't you see? That would
be taking the easy way out?

16:49.758 --> 16:50.968
I agree.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.177
(explosion)

17:06.775 --> 17:08.527
(beeping)

17:13.907 --> 17:15.159
Damn it, Bob.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.411
There were plenty
of brand-new bombs

17:17.494 --> 17:19.997
but you had to go for
that retro-'50s charm.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.499
(scared gulps)

17:22.583 --> 17:24.460
Well, if it isn't
my arch nemesis

17:24.543 --> 17:27.254
Bart Simpson
and his sister Lisa

17:27.337 --> 17:28.505
to whom I'm fairly indifferent.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.799
So Krusty double-crossed you,

17:30.883 --> 17:33.761
but your basic plan
was pure genius.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.388
Where do you get your ideas?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.890
Oh, please.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.600
Let's not
embarrass us both

17:39.683 --> 17:41.435
with that hoary old
"stall the villain

17:41.518 --> 17:42.478
with flattery" scheme.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.232
I... should have known you
were too smart to fall for that.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.902
Really? What type of smart?
Book smart?

17:49.985 --> 17:51.820
Because there are a lot of
people who are book smart

17:51.904 --> 17:53.822
but it takes a very
special type of genius to...

17:53.906 --> 17:55.199
CHIEF WIGGUM:
<i>All right, Bob, it's over.</i>

17:55.282 --> 17:57.034
Come out with
your hands up.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.827
No!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.370
How did they find me?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.841
(Lisa gasps)

18:17.054 --> 18:18.722
LISA:
He's getting away!

18:21.725 --> 18:23.519
Aw, not the Harrier.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.853
We've got a war
tomorrow.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.189
God bless
the idiot-proof Air Force.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.279
They're gone!

18:36.073 --> 18:39.451
HAPABLAP: Hell. Not the
Wright Brothers' plane.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.246
The Smithsonian's gonna
have my ass on a platter.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.625
BART:
Dad!

18:46.708 --> 18:48.794
Help!

18:48.877 --> 18:50.254
Aaah!

18:50.337 --> 18:51.505
Hang on, boy!

18:51.588 --> 18:53.632
Daddy's coming to save you!

18:53.715 --> 18:55.634
D'oh!

18:55.717 --> 18:58.720
Mom, I found
Sideshow Bob's hideout,

18:58.804 --> 19:00.264
and I got a secret message
to the police,

19:00.347 --> 19:02.141
and I had a blimp fall on me,

19:02.224 --> 19:03.934
and I was in an atomic blast,
but I'm okay now.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.645
Well, I wrecked the gate,
but you don't hear me bragging.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.938
Now let's roll.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.070
Ah, for the days
when aviation

19:15.154 --> 19:16.488
was a gentleman's
pursuit--

19:16.572 --> 19:18.615
back before
every Joe Sweat Sock

19:18.699 --> 19:20.534
could wedge himself
behind a lunch tray

19:20.617 --> 19:22.703
and jet off
to Raleigh-Durham.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.706
Are you getting lots of bugs
in your mouth, too?

19:25.789 --> 19:26.915
Yes.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.000
(spitting)

19:30.335 --> 19:31.545
<i>Prepare to engage enemy.</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:35.507
<i>Bogie's airspeed not sufficient</i>
<i>for intercept.</i>

19:35.591 --> 19:36.967
<i>Suggest we get out and walk.</i>

19:44.641 --> 19:46.685
Jump, boy! I got ya!

19:46.768 --> 19:48.187
I'm coming!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.438
(both grunt)

19:54.943 --> 19:57.321
Now you, boy!

19:57.404 --> 19:59.823
(gasps)
You can't escape, Bob.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.159
If the tennis rackets don't get you,
the pool skimmers will.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.578
Whoo. I-- I never
planned to escape.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.331
You see, this is
a kamikaze mission.

20:07.414 --> 20:11.251
You and I are going
to kill Krusty the Clown!

20:11.335 --> 20:12.794
-(laughs)
-(gasps)

20:17.257 --> 20:19.384
Kids, Itchy and Scratchy
can't be here today

20:19.468 --> 20:22.763
but instead, we've got
the next best thing--

20:22.846 --> 20:25.057
<i>It's the Stingy</i>
<i>and Battery Show.</i>

20:25.140 --> 20:26.767

20:31.146 --> 20:33.649
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:34.816
You can't
kill Krusty.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.485
He made you
what you are.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.862
Without him, you wouldn't even be
called "Sideshow."

20:38.946 --> 20:40.405
(snarling)

20:40.489 --> 20:43.242
(loud puttering)

20:43.325 --> 20:45.410
What the hell is that?
A lawn mower?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.162
Yah!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.413
BART:
Get out of the way, Krusty!

20:57.297 --> 20:59.049
What is the freaking holdup?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.761
D-i-i-i-e, Krusty!

21:02.844 --> 21:04.429
Di..!

21:04.513 --> 21:05.430
Oh.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.015
(siren wailing)

21:08.558 --> 21:10.560
Ooh, sorry.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.897
Uh, we don't normally drive
these in the Air Force.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.357
Gotcha!

21:15.440 --> 21:17.943
Ha-ha!
You TV-hating mutant!

21:18.026 --> 21:20.696
What is your major
malfunction, Sideshow Bob?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.406
Whoa, whoa...

21:22.489 --> 21:23.907
Oh, my little
sugar bug.
