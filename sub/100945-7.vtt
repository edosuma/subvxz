WEBVTT

00:31.906 --> 00:35.035
POTUS is still mad
about the whole India thing.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.913
So, as punishment, he wants us
to partner with private industry.

00:38.997 --> 00:43.460
Specifically, he wants us
to use this tech guru's new fuel

00:43.543 --> 00:45.295
in the lunar satellite launch.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.546
Not her.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.966
Ed... Edison Jaymes?
Are you kidding me?

00:50.050 --> 00:53.553
No. She's gonna be here in a few minutes
to inspect the base

00:53.928 --> 00:56.681
and make sure
that we are worthy of her product.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.724
I read about that.

00:57.807 --> 01:01.936
It's supposedly half as heavy
as normal fuel, and no pollutants.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.730
I mean, that would be a game changer.

01:03.813 --> 01:07.358
God, I am so sick of people
fawning over these young tech moguls.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.194
The government is plenty innovative.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.988
Did you know that the US Postal Service

01:12.072 --> 01:14.157
issues a new Christmas stamp
every Christmas

01:14.240 --> 01:16.409
and has done so for the past 200 years?

01:16.826 --> 01:19.496
Mark, I don't think the Postal Service
still exists.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.540
-Well, I think they do.
-No.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.959
Where do you think our funding came from?

01:29.172 --> 01:30.298
Hmm.

01:33.885 --> 01:34.928
She's late.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.471
She's too rich to be late.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.181
Rich people are such babies.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.438
There she is.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.275
Well, jeans
and $100,000 worth of diamonds.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.401
That's a good look.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.903
It's a confusing look.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.657
I don't know whether she's going
to Cinderella's ball or a pig roast.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.284
Fuck. Fuck me.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.161
You bite the inside of your mouth?
I've done that.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.372
No. That's Hannah Howard.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.290
We came up in the PR world together.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.585
She single-handedly orchestrated
my dismissal from American Apparel

02:07.669 --> 02:10.046
by leaking my text messages.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.842
She is by far the worst person
I have ever met in my entire life.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.135
Hannah!

02:15.218 --> 02:16.845
Oh, my God, I'm coming down.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.012
You look amazing!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.514
Ms. Jaymes?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.394
Here he is.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.520
Nice to meet you.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.855
-General Naird.
-Welcome to Space--

02:26.938 --> 02:28.857
-Ah-ah.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.650
Good to tweet?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.069
-Yes, with the usual adjustments.
-Of course.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.197
When POTUS called me
and asked me to help you guys out,

02:36.281 --> 02:37.198
I was stoked.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.535
I was stoked as well. And... amped.

02:40.952 --> 02:45.290
Yeah. Not just for our country,
but my rocket fuel needs customers.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.084
And you'll have to forgive me
if I sound like a woman on a mission,

02:48.918 --> 02:49.836
but I am one.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.924
You see, my fuel
makes your rocket burn more cleanly.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.801
Well done.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.636
Oh, please.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.140
<i>Have you made any new friends yet?</i>

03:02.223 --> 03:03.308
No, Grandpa.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.310
I still have my old friends in DC.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.394
No, you don't.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.771
People move on fast at your age.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.525
<i>I can't name one friend</i>
<i>I had in high school.</i>

03:12.609 --> 03:14.569
Oh, I'm guessing there was an Al.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.863
-There were a lot of Als back then.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.990
Most of them died during the war, though.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.868
That's why there's no more Als.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.703
Cool.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.538
<i> Hey, put your mom on.</i>

03:26.372 --> 03:28.833
My phone's at one percent,
and Mom's in prison.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.043
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

03:30.293 --> 03:32.337
<i>Darling,</i>
<i>you've got to keep your phone char--</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:36.132
Great.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.701
Nice.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.370
Very...

04:06.496 --> 04:07.372
very...

04:08.414 --> 04:09.749
nice.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.437
Ooh. Fancy.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.563
-Ah!

04:32.647 --> 04:34.274
License and registration, miss!

04:35.441 --> 04:36.567
-Jesus Christ!

04:36.651 --> 04:38.444
Duncan, you scared the shit out of me!

04:38.528 --> 04:39.821
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.073
-Should I get rags or paper towels?
-Oh, no.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.409
-My mom hates wasting paper towels...
-Oh, no, no.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.703
...but folks don't sell rags in Colorado--

04:46.786 --> 04:48.079
Oh, just move. Move, move, move!

04:48.162 --> 04:49.914
Just go. Go, go, go!

04:51.332 --> 04:55.169
This is a sample
of the treatment I recently developed

04:55.253 --> 04:58.214
for methicillin-resistant pathogens
in space.

04:58.298 --> 05:02.010
Bleh. God, that thing. Six months
and a bunch of rats over budget.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.721
At the biotech arm of Edison Jaymes,

05:04.804 --> 05:07.682
it would have taken us half the time
and a quarter of the rats.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.185
Well, always said
we spend way too much money on the rats.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.854
Well, it didn't take that long.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.816
I did invent a medicine, after all.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.485
Thank you for signing these NDAs.
Standard procedure.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.280
Thank you for signing these NDAs.
You get it.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.240
You know what an NDA is,
don't you, Scarapiducci?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.285
So cute. You know what?
Ours don't even need to be signed.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.413
-You sign them just by being here.
-Hmm. Never heard of that.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.583
What you don't know about this place
could fill a giant underground silo

05:33.666 --> 05:35.001
that you don't even know exists.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.711
Mm. Is that where they keep your office?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.212
No.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.593
Hey!
I heard you know some shit about plants.

05:43.843 --> 05:44.927
Hmm. Let's see.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.138
I'm an astrobotanist
with an advanced degree

05:47.221 --> 05:50.391
in cross-pollination
and dry terrain root systems.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.309
What does that mean?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.811
I know some shit about plants.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.146
Sorry. Who are you?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.773
I'm Captain Angela Ali.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.859
I wanna learn astrobotany.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.402
For fun.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.738
Well, I'm not a science tutor.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.823
Well, I'll pay you 50 bucks an hour.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.659
I could do every day from noon to one.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.704
Great. Meet me here. Please be organized,
be prepped, and be early.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.707
I really don't wanna pay for, like,
"Hi, how are you, weather" bullshit.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.252
Cool! I haven't started,
and I already wanna quit.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.921
So glad I made this choice.

06:20.004 --> 06:20.838
Yeah.

06:20.922 --> 06:21.756
Me too.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.719
Wow.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.305
Which one of these awards
means the most to you?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.141
Bronze Star.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.896
I was shot down over Bosnia,
survived on worms for six days.

06:36.979 --> 06:37.814
Oh, I did that.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.607
-On an episode of <i>Bear Grylls.</i>
-Oh.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.234
Yeah.<i> </i>Very keto.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.527
Okay.

06:44.362 --> 06:48.199
I used a sponge to collect rainwater
and store it in plastic bags.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.035
Where did you get a sponge
and plastic bags?

06:51.536 --> 06:52.578
Piddle pack.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.373
Pilots use them to relieve themselves.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.125
Sexually.

06:58.334 --> 07:01.504
Mmm, no, no. Like going to the bathroom.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.840
Oh, my God.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.051
General Mark Naird,
do you know what you are?

07:07.135 --> 07:08.136
No, no, no, no.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.387
I am not a deviant.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.807
I didn't pee on the sponge and then use
that same sponge to collect rainwater.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.560
-That's not my thing.
<i>-</i>Right.<i> </i>No. No.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.521
You are an innovator!

07:18.729 --> 07:20.148
Oh, okay.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.232
-You are.
-Yeah.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.442
-Well...
-Think about it.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.818
That was very <i>MacGyver.</i>

07:24.235 --> 07:26.362
If that's not innovation,
then I don't even know what is.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.282
I wouldn't really call it innovation.
It was just something that I did.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.658
It was just using the tools

07:30.741 --> 07:32.535
-that I had at my disposal.
-Come on.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.580
I have an idea, from time to time.

07:35.663 --> 07:39.250
-I had a feeling.
-I am not a tech whiz like you,

07:39.333 --> 07:41.085
but I think of some things.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.588
-Tell me. Tell me!
-No. No, they're silly.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.465
I wanna hear.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.758
Okay.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.512
So you know how people shake hands
all over the world?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.264
-Mm-hmm.
-It's a universal thing.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.684
It is a sign of respect, decency.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.562
Yeah. It's a normal human handshake.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.064
Exactly. So imagine a device,

08:02.440 --> 08:05.818
like a mannequin, with a shakable arm.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.614
And you put one in Times Square.
You put on in Tiananmen Square.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.991
It's all linked up technologically.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.701
You've got video screens.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.454
You can shake the hand
of someone in China.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.668
It's brilliant.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.631
-Bringing strangers together.
-That's exactly right!

08:26.797 --> 08:28.299
-Mm-hmm.
-That's what I've been saying!

08:28.382 --> 08:30.927
-I love it.
-Shaking hands across the world.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.845
Will that be its name?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.639
Yes.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.015
It's good.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.352
So-- And inside the booth,
there's an attendant.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.855
That precludes
any sort of sexual shenanigans going on.

08:42.939 --> 08:43.940
Mmm.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.399
And you don't have to tip the attendant

08:45.483 --> 08:47.485
because it's part
of the cost of admission.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.444
It's all covered.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.403
Okay.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.406
It sounds silly when you just say it
to people, but it's...

08:52.490 --> 08:53.533
No! No, it does not.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.952
Mark, this is your vision.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.328
I don't want you to shame it.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.788
-You believe in it,

08:59.622 --> 09:01.290
and you will change the world.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.668
Well...

09:03.751 --> 09:04.669
Oh.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.796
Wow.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.217
Okay. We need to get our stories straight.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.178
The guy who spilled the soft serve

09:14.262 --> 09:17.974
was a rich white guy
in a "Where's Waldo" T-shirt.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.143
See?
That's so specific, people will buy it.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.479
I don't know. I can't picture it.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
You can't picture people believing it?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.984
No, I can't picture
what you're describing.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.694
I don't have that ability.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.321
Okay.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.864
Close your eyes.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.326
Ronald McDonald on a surfboard.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.203
What do you see?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.456
Nothing.
It's just like staring at a blank page.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.625
Oh, my God.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.837
You have no imagination. That's...

09:48.546 --> 09:49.755
That's adorable.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.758
Hey, it's a real condition.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.176
-Aphantasia.
-Oh.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.512
Yes. Well, way to sell yourself.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.681
So, what are your strengths?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.766
Oh, that is one of my strengths.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.602
I can stare at a cereal box.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.645
That's like watching HBO to me.

10:07.481 --> 10:11.736
I can't wait to talk to you
about the nuts and bolts of your fuel,

10:11.819 --> 10:13.362
the actual chemistry.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.864
Patience, Dr. Mallory.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.949
I'm about to answer all of your questions.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.703
In fact,
may I invite you to a little barbecue?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.502
- Your phone.
-No, thank you.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.171
You have to put it in the secure case,

10:30.254 --> 10:32.173
which will open again
after the demo is over.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.799
No phones is part of the NDA you signed.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.217
Yeah, no,
I don't think I'll be doing that,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.637
because the last time
I handed you my phone,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.931
I wasn't allowed within 300 feet
of my own fucking office.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.559
Are you still holding a grudge?
Don't be petulant, Anthony.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.895
"Don't be petulant, Anthony."
You're a goblin.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.607
-What? What are you doing?
-The ankle.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.776
-The holster on your ankle...
-This is so--

10:51.859 --> 10:53.569
-...that you hand-stitched yourself.
-This is stupid.<i> </i>

10:53.653 --> 10:55.321
You are pathetic. Jesus Christ.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.239
For generations,

10:57.323 --> 11:00.534
chemists have looked to the stars
and asked a question:

11:01.577 --> 11:05.623
Can a fuel be created
that consumes its own exhaust?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.084
Those chemists were men,

11:08.542 --> 11:10.044
and the answer was no.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.962
And then I came along.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.092
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting Skinny Fuel...

11:16.759 --> 11:18.469
a rosé colored rocket fuel

11:18.552 --> 11:23.641
cheaper, lighter, and cleaner
than any fuel ever created.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.144
I can't help but be impressed.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.481
-Thank you.
-But it's just that NASA astrochemists

11:30.564 --> 11:32.983
have been trying to concoct a solution

11:33.067 --> 11:35.486
with the same end result for years,

11:35.569 --> 11:39.115
so, what is the molecular structure,

11:39.198 --> 11:41.283
and how did you arrive at it?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.660
Excellent. Thank you.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.831
Edison Jaymes
is a publicly traded company,

11:46.914 --> 11:50.876
and it would be unfair to our stockholders
to share proprietary information.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.961
However...

11:52.628 --> 11:54.338
I can demonstrate for you.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.677
-This...

11:59.927 --> 12:01.846
...regular Kingsford lighter fuel.

12:05.141 --> 12:05.975
And this...

12:07.601 --> 12:08.811
is Skinny Fuel.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.693
Thank you.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.366
So, why won't she be open
about the chemistry?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.201
That seems really sketchy.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.870
You're not jealous, are you?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.998
Just because she answered the question
no male scientist could?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.708
Excuse me, Mark,

12:30.791 --> 12:34.670
I'm on the board
of Cincinnati Women in STEM.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.672
This is about the science.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.341
I think she covered it
with her presentation.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.843
No, she told us nothing.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.803
She doesn't even need the fuel to work.

12:42.887 --> 12:48.142
She can fundraise off the mere fact
of having gotten her fuel into a rocket,

12:48.225 --> 12:51.145
and then she can always blame us
if it all goes sideways.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.271
This is classic.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.690
As soon as somebody thinks
that I am smart,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.233
you decide that they are dumb.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.487
What did you discuss in here, exactly?

12:59.904 --> 13:03.115
Noth-- We just exchanged some ideas,
I offered some of mine.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.910
Such as... what? The six-day workweek?

13:05.993 --> 13:08.412
The pear-grape hybrid?

13:10.623 --> 13:16.086
Did you discuss with her
your idea for a handshaking machine,

13:16.170 --> 13:21.842
which I swear to you,
people will only use to jerk off into?

13:22.468 --> 13:26.013
I added an attendant
after your feedback, Adrian.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.892
Look, I am the one who is in charge here.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.228
We're going with the Skinny Fuel.
That's final.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.270
Damn it.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
-Adrian. Adrian! Wait.
-What?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.359
Are we still going tie shopping later
at Walmart?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.528
My conjugal visit is next week.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.072
No. You have great ideas. You go.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.951
And anyway,
they have fantastic fashion consultants.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.203
They're the ones wearing the red vests.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.329
You dick.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.042
I hope I'm not interrupting.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.753
No, no, no.  just a heated discussion
with a colleague.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.214
Well, I do know a little bit
about fashion,

14:00.297 --> 14:01.549
if you'd like another opinion.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.467
Hmm.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.095
Dude, you're late.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.346
I texted you.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.265
Okay, I want a discount on my hour.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.767
Jesus, for someone
who's trying to study botany for fun,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.978
you're taking your shit really seriously.

14:14.478 --> 14:18.941
Okay, fine. It's for the AAT.
I wanna be an astronaut.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.901
You wanna be an astronaut?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.736
Yeah, what?
You think I can't fly a spaceship?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.822
No, I didn't say that. Go fly a spaceship.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.283
I'm sure you'd be
a real calming presence up there.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.369
The others will love being trapped
in a tiny capsule with you

14:30.452 --> 14:32.496
in the vacuum of space.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.915
Just-- Could we study plants, please?

14:39.503 --> 14:41.922
This is my new fashion website. "Shrt."

14:42.006 --> 14:43.048
Mmm.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.258
You got a little typo.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.093
Might wanna fix that
before you roll this thing out.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.345
This was a team effort.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.598
And there is no "I" in "shirt."

14:51.682 --> 14:53.517
Ah. Okay.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.436
So you answered your survey,
the six questions?

14:55.519 --> 14:56.979
-Uh, yeah.
-Okay.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.064
Let's see what the algorithm says
you should wear.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.317
-Algorithm. That's crazy.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.282
- Okay, well...

15:08.365 --> 15:10.951
Huh. Ah... Huh.

15:11.035 --> 15:15.164
I've never... worn anything that purposely
showed off my ankles before.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.248
Don't you love it, though?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.042
Nah... no, I don't, actually.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.793
-It looks kind of goofy.
-Goofy?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.211
Not me. It's just not me.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.089
Mark, you need to believe in yourself.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.634
Your ankles look beautiful.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.720
-You look amazing.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.681
Your wife is going to love this.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.309
-Oh, really?
-Mmm.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.103
Okay.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.271
Okay. You know what?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.482
You may be the publicist
to a major celebrity,

15:41.565 --> 15:45.402
but I am the publicist
to man's search for something grander,

15:45.486 --> 15:47.988
something that transcends this world.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.699
Fuck you. I'm so jealous. I'm so jealous.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.368
What are they even doing in there?

15:52.618 --> 15:53.869
It's a new venture.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.579
Blue Apron meets Bonobos.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.122
The algorithm tells you
it loves your pants

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
regardless of how fat your ass looks.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.669
She's doing that,
and she has a rocket fuel?

16:01.752 --> 16:05.381
Uh, yeah. Skinny Fuel is like
one of 100 projects she's developing.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.675
'Cause if one thing works,
nobody remembers the failures.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.136
What do you mean, "if" one thing works?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.097
I mean, "when."

16:14.098 --> 16:15.808
Hannah, does the rocket fuel work?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.768
Yeah.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.354
Hannah.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.485
Botany's actually, like,
pretty self-explanatory.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.029
"Chloroplast and Epidural Stomata."

16:29.113 --> 16:31.323
Yeah, these words just define themselves.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.950
-Right?

16:33.701 --> 16:34.910
Do you not know Latin?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.705
Okay, just teach me
like I'm a child who knows nothing,

16:37.788 --> 16:39.456
but also,
don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.501
Okay, that's gonna be
a little bit of a high-wire act.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.795
And can we pick up the pace, please?
It's been 20 minutes,

16:44.878 --> 16:47.047
and I have learned,
like, literally nothing.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.340
Okay, you gotta calm down.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.135
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it my way. Okay?

16:51.218 --> 16:52.678
I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.723
Oh, cool! Yeah, yeah, let's all kick back.
Just get a bite to eat.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.516
Why don't we just order in
and watch <i>Frasier?</i>

16:57.599 --> 16:59.810
I have shit to do, bro. Do you see this?

17:00.227 --> 17:01.353
Okay, "bro."

17:01.437 --> 17:04.231
Nice talking to you
for the second time in my life.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.400
Okay, hey.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.526
Wait.<i> </i>I'm sorry.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.527
I'm just...

17:10.696 --> 17:15.909
God, saying you want to be an astronaut
after age, like, eight, feels very silly.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.204
I just really need you
to take me seriously.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.665
I do take you seriously.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.129
I mean, maybe not as serious as you
take yourself, but that's off the charts.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.714
Yeah.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.843
If you're gonna get a snack,
I will take a Rocket Pie.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.553
Peanut butter or banana, please.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.555
-What if they have both?
-Ooh.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.973
Good question.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.600
Peanu...

17:39.683 --> 17:41.393
nana...

17:41.477 --> 17:44.271
butter-peanut-nana-banana.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.482
No, coconut or lime.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.361
Well, if you die in space,
it'll be from murder.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.158
Mmm. You excited?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.242
Sure am.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.579
But how are you feeling, Mark?
Are you excited?

18:00.662 --> 18:01.747
About the launch?

18:01.830 --> 18:03.707
You are going to love it.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.626
Am I?

18:07.711 --> 18:10.422
-Oh, my God. What is he doing?
-It's me! Can I talk to you?

18:10.506 --> 18:13.217
Let's not incinerate my media manager.
I'll be right back.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.263
Okay, General, I never get involved

18:18.347 --> 18:20.307
in whether people
are telling the truth or lying.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.935
I mean, those words carry
very little meaning to me,

18:23.018 --> 18:26.396
but something one of Edison's people said,
it's got me worried.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.689
What was that?

18:28.690 --> 18:29.608
"Yeah."

18:31.151 --> 18:34.196
Sorry, guess it was more how she said it.
I asked, "Does the rocket fuel work?"

18:34.279 --> 18:36.406
Then she said, "Yeah."

18:37.825 --> 18:40.702
I'm butchering it. She said it like this.
She said it like this.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.663
"Yeah."

18:42.746 --> 18:45.040
Fuck. She said, "Yeah."

18:46.250 --> 18:47.167
It doesn't matter.

18:47.251 --> 18:51.922
As a publicist, I never reveal my sources,
but it was Hannah.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.720
Hmm. Dr. Mallory, come with me.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.140
And, Tony, nicely done.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.187
Fuck you, American Apparel.

19:07.729 --> 19:08.939
What's going on?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.858
It's a simple scientific formula.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.403
When a guy as full of BS as Tony
calls BS on someone else,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.113
that is BS squared.

19:16.196 --> 19:21.118
I wouldn't call it a scientific formula,
but, okay.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.955
Our first crime together.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.791
May there be many more.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.922
So, uh...

19:35.382 --> 19:36.341
What...

19:36.884 --> 19:38.677
what have you been reading lately?

19:39.553 --> 19:40.470
Excuse me?

19:40.888 --> 19:42.097
Nothing. Nothing.

19:42.347 --> 19:46.518
Just that, uh, that Denver airport
sure is crazy, huh?

19:47.269 --> 19:50.606
Duncan, have you been reading
to impress me?

19:50.689 --> 19:52.191
No. No.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.027
But if I had, would you be impressed?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.196
I very much...

19:58.071 --> 19:59.114
might.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.826
So...

20:03.869 --> 20:07.122
that, uh... Denver airport.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.251
Well, I read it was two billion dollars
over budget.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.212
Ooh, I was not aware.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.215
Yeah.
And many believe that the money was used

20:16.298 --> 20:18.675
to build underground meeting rooms

20:18.759 --> 20:21.136
for those who control the world economy.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.347
The Illuminati.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.557
Wait.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.976
What are you reading?

20:28.435 --> 20:29.478
Websites.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.022
Oh.

20:34.024 --> 20:34.983
Uh...

20:35.609 --> 20:37.569
Uh, did you know that
the queen of England--

20:37.653 --> 20:41.198
The queen of England
is the largest drug pusher in the world?

20:41.615 --> 20:42.658
No, seriously.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.744
And she killed Jeffrey Epstein
with her bare hands.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.914
And she leaves one of her fingernails
real long

20:48.997 --> 20:50.582
and has poison on the tip.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.126
Wow.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.675
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

21:00.008 --> 21:02.844
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

21:03.512 --> 21:05.389
<i>four, three,</i>

21:05.847 --> 21:07.182
<i>two, one.</i>

21:10.227 --> 21:11.770
Okay, so far, so good.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.355
Fingers crossed.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.817
Don't worry.<i> </i>I adjusted the fuel ratios.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.901
Off the books.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.112
I hope that's all right.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.741
Well, how much Skinny Fuel
did you end up using?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.159
Uh...

21:26.243 --> 21:27.077
Zero.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.787
Oh, thank you.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.709
It's... completely off the books?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.960
One hundred percent.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.379
Booster separation complete.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.178
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

21:47.306 --> 21:48.890
Actually, you can call POTUS.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.184
And you can tell him
that we're doing just fine.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.563
We don't need any outside help
from the private sector.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.649
-Something like that.
<i>-</i>You got it.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.692
Okay.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.904
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Mm.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.032
It's not running on Kingsford.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.409
Okay.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.327
Cute.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.289
Congratulations, Ms. Jaymes.

22:12.372 --> 22:17.294
Today you appeared to have
a very successful launch with your fuel.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.295
Thank you.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.049
Um, don't take this the wrong way,
but you could use some mouthwash.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.594
Ah, well,
perhaps the breath refreshment sector

22:25.677 --> 22:28.555
is where you should redirect your efforts.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.308
That feels a bit more feasible for you.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.309
Hmm.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.562
If you ever get big and powerful one day,
come see me.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.564
I might have
an extremely low-level position for you.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.483
Or maybe one day
you'll be big and powerful enough

22:39.566 --> 22:42.027
-for me to take you seriously.
-Maybe we'll both be big and powerful.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.070
Maybe we will.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.332
Fuck!

22:56.541 --> 22:57.876
-All right, so take--

23:02.589 --> 23:04.508
Why does my car
smell like baby vomit?

23:13.100 --> 23:13.975
So...

23:14.726 --> 23:15.936
what do you make...

23:17.604 --> 23:18.605
of this one?

23:18.855 --> 23:20.482
Oh. It's brown.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.983
Brown doesn't go with anything.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.195
Oh, there are things
that go with brown, I'm sure.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.446
Oh.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.449
Thank God I have you.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.078
That's a very nice thing to say.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.081
-Oh, I like that.
-That one? Pretty.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.044
Yeah?

23:41.503 --> 23:45.757
The Prospector Satellite
is now in orbit around the moon.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.301
Good! Is the camera transmitting yet?

23:48.385 --> 23:51.012
Yes, sir. Uh, we have our first images.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.347
Very good.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.016
Oh, excellent.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.353
Oh, that's a beautiful shot.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.981
You might enjoy
scrolling through these quickly.

24:03.024 --> 24:03.942
What is that?

24:05.610 --> 24:08.822
Oh... We're not 100 percent sure
what that is yet.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.077
The Chinese flag.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.662
What?

24:16.121 --> 24:17.747
-Oh.
-What?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.583
-Did-- Did you--
-Oh!

24:19.666 --> 24:21.460
Wow! Look at that!

24:22.043 --> 24:24.254
I had no idea they were that far along.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.465
-That's something.
-Huh.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.592
Oh, good for them!

24:28.758 --> 24:30.969
That's great.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.597
Got a...

24:34.097 --> 24:36.683
Oh, I am happy for them.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.685
They really are there.

24:38.768 --> 24:39.978
Look at that.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.233
Oh, shit!

24:45.775 --> 24:49.070
<i>Those Chinese bastards did it.</i>

24:49.696 --> 24:50.906
<i>They did it!</i>

24:51.698 --> 24:54.493
<i>Ha! That is rich.</i>
