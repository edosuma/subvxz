MAKE IT FUNKY, BABY.

00:14.415 --> 00:18.452
ALL RIGHT, HENRY, COME ON.
TAKE US HOME, MAN.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.562
WHOO!

00:30.831 --> 00:33.401
IT'S GETTIN' THERE,
IT'S GETTIN' THERE.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.735
I DON'T LIKE
THE FLUTAPHONE.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING THE BONGOS.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.606
YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FUNK.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.507
I DO SO.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.308
HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.476
WHAT HAVE I TAUGHT YOU
ABOUT SHARING?

00:42.510 --> 00:45.179
NOTHING.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.149
WELL, SHARE.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.584
FINE, TAKE THE BONGOS,
BUT I QUIT THE BAND.

00:50.618 --> 00:55.256
GOOD. WE DON'T NEED
A STUPID FLUTAPHONE
PLAYER ANYWAY.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.858
HEY! WHAT'S UP, MAN?
HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

00:57.891 --> 01:01.229
GREAT! OH, IT WAS GREAT.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.696
N'AWLINS
IS A HELL OF A TOWN.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.731
W-WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

01:03.764 --> 01:07.301
WHOO, THAT'S
A WONDAMUS STORY,
YOU DAGGUM RIGHT.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.836
"DAGGUM RIGHT"?

01:08.869 --> 01:11.205
WELL, THAT'S
HOW WE SAY IT
DOWN IN N'AWLINS.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.108
OH, COME ON, MAN.
YOU WERE LIKE, LIKE,
DOWN THERE FOR A WEEK.

01:14.142 --> 01:18.212
N'AWLINS GETS IN
A MAN'S BLOOD, SEAN.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.680
WHAT DID YOU BRING US,
UNCLE EDDIE?

01:19.713 --> 01:23.117
CHILD, WAIT
TILL YOU SEE WHAT
I DONE BROUGHT YOU.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.456
TINY GLASSES.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.524
WITH BUTTS
ON 'EM.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.193
LOOK, I'M UNCLE EDDIE.

01:32.226 --> 01:37.498
"OH, WHOA, DUDE,
I STOOD UP TOO FAST."

01:38.166 --> 01:41.535
HEY, LET'S GO
GET SOME KOOL-AID
AND I'LL BE GRANDPA.

01:41.569 --> 01:42.436
ALL RIGHT.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.272
WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH YOUR HALF
OF THE MONEY

01:44.305 --> 01:47.741
WHILE I WAS
EATIN' éTOUFFéE
IN N'AWLINS?

01:47.775 --> 01:52.180
BUY A NEW GARBAGE
DISPOSAL? A WATER
HEATER, PERHAPS?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.415
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHAT GOOD WOULD
A WATER HEATER BE

01:54.448 --> 01:57.818
WITHOUT A LITTLE,
UH, BACKGROUND MUSIC?

01:57.851 --> 01:59.920
WHAT DO YOU--
YOU GOT A LES PAUL?

01:59.953 --> 02:00.754
MAYBE.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.791
YOU SUCK.
MAYBE.

02:03.824 --> 02:04.658
LET ME PLAY IT.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.494
COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, 3 CHORDS.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
I KNOW CHORDS
THAT HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN INVENTED YET.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.465
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'VE PLAYED WITH YOU BEFORE.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.700
COME ON.
NO, NO.
COME ON!

02:12.733 --> 02:17.571
OK, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
BUT JUST DON'T--NO--
NO WINDMILLS.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.811
YOU GOTTA
TURN THIS BABY UP.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.779
HEY, COME ON, EDDIE.
I GOT NEIGHBORS, MAN.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.515
COME ON,
I GOT NEIGHBORS!

02:32.320 --> 02:35.256
Sean:
GREAT. GREAT!

02:35.623 --> 02:39.393
Eddie: HEY, YOU GOT
BAD WIRING OR SOMETHING.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.476
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET HIM TOUCH IT.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.544
YOU KNOW
HE BREAKS THINGS.

02:56.577 --> 03:00.180
COME ON, YOU WEREN'T HERE.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR HIM WHINE.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.783
DON'T LET HIM
TOUCH IT AGAIN.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.253
IT'S LIKE
JAMES DEAN'S
JACKET.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.221
IT'S ONLY SEXY
ON YOU.

03:07.255 --> 03:10.424
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S MY BABY. MMM.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.560
I THOUGHT
I WAS YOUR BABY.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.629
WELL, YOU
THOUGHT WRONG.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.769
GOD,
I LOVE MUSICIANS!

03:24.305 --> 03:26.707
HEY, LILY.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.208
HELLO.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.914
GOD, YOU, UM,
REALLY STINK.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.216
YEAH, THANKS.

03:37.351 --> 03:41.422
I JUST KINDA VOMITED
IN MY MOUTH.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.358
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.494
THERE'S PIG'S BLOOD
ALL OVER MY SKECHERS.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.863
AH, WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE GOTTEN THE RED ONES.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.902
HEY, MAN, I, UH,
DON'T MEAN TO PRY,
BUT, UH...

03:54.935 --> 03:56.270
MAN, YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.271
ACTUALLY, I KINDA DO.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.740
ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT ALL
HAPPENED BEFORE YOU WENT

03:59.773 --> 04:01.942
DOWN TO "N'AWLINS,"
ALL RIGHT?

04:01.975 --> 04:04.578
SHE CAME HOME ALL FIRED UP
ABOUT SOME SKI TRIP...

04:04.612 --> 04:07.681
EVERYBODY'S GOING
AND MR. CADALINI
IS CHAPERONING,

04:07.715 --> 04:08.882
SO YOU KNOW I WON'T
GET INTO ANY TROUBLE.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.353
WAIT. DIDN'T HE
SLEEP WITH A STUDENT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO?

04:12.386 --> 04:13.287
ALLEGEDLY.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.688
HE IS A REALLY
GOOD TEACHER.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.824
NOW, SIGN
MY PERMISSION SLIP, OK?

04:16.857 --> 04:17.858
HOW MUCH IS THIS
GONNA COST?

04:17.891 --> 04:20.628
$500 IS VERY CHEAP
FOR AN EXPERIENCE

04:20.661 --> 04:23.431
I WILL REMEMBER
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.998
NO.
NO.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.967
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
CONSIDER IT!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.469
IT WAS A KNEE-JERK
REACTION

04:28.502 --> 04:30.404
CAUSED BY AN EXTREME
LACK OF MONEY.

04:30.438 --> 04:33.574
WELL, WHAT IF I PAY
FOR IT MYSELF?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.608
OK.

04:34.642 --> 04:38.011
I DON'T HAVE $500!

04:38.045 --> 04:38.979
Lily:
BUT MARGARET'S GOING

04:39.012 --> 04:40.981
AND HER DAD'S
BEEN OUT OF WORK
FOR 6 MONTHS.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.318
HEY, CAN YOU HAND ME
THE SOCKET WRENCH, PLEASE?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.487
YOU BUY STUFF FOR JIMMY
AND HENRY ALL THE TIME.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.022
I MEAN, HOW MANY
FREAKING POKéMON
ARE THERE?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.892
155. WILL YOU HAND ME
THE SOCKET WRENCH, PLEASE?

04:51.925 --> 04:55.062
GET PIKACHU
TO HAND IT TO YOU.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.766
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
GO FOR THE OBVIOUS ONE.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.569
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
YOU WON'T LET ME GO.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.571
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.138
AND SO YOU KNOW I WON'T
DO ANY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL,

05:05.172 --> 05:09.910
I HAVE SIGNED THIS PLEDGE
WHICH STATES, "I WILL NOT
DO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL."

05:09.943 --> 05:10.878
CAN I GO?

05:10.911 --> 05:13.614
NO!
AAH!

05:14.014 --> 05:15.983
MAN, SHE'S
REALLY A PIT BULL.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.618
YEAH, YEAH,
BUT I WAS HANDLING IT,

05:17.651 --> 05:18.619
AND EVERYTHING
WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE

05:18.652 --> 05:21.054
UNTIL YOU HAD TO GO
AND OPEN UP YOUR BIG MOUTH.

05:21.088 --> 05:21.855
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

05:21.889 --> 05:23.857
COME ON. WHEN
YOU AND DAD CAME DOWN

05:23.891 --> 05:25.826
LATER THAT AFTERNOON.
YOU REMEMBER?

05:25.859 --> 05:26.927
NO.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.131
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.
YOU GOT "N'AWLINS"
IN YOUR BLOOD.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.001
YOUR MOTHER,
GOD REST HER SOUL,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.936
MANAGED TO SQUIRREL AWAY
SOME MONEY

05:35.969 --> 05:37.605
IN A PASSBOOK ACCOUNT
FOR YOU TWO.

05:37.638 --> 05:42.075
IT'S NOT A LOT, BUT
SHE WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.945
HOW MUCH IS
"NOT A LOT"?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.781
HEY, LILY.
INSIDE,
YOUNG LADY, OK?

05:51.519 --> 05:53.053
$1,800!

05:53.086 --> 05:55.088
YES! THANK YOU, GRANDMA!

05:55.122 --> 05:55.723
HOLD ON.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.025
I'M GOING
TO NEW ORLEANS.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.727
THIS IS
SO GREAT.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.694
HEY, YOUR SKI TRIP
IS NOT MY PRIORITY.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.063
I'M GONNA GO
CALL KRISTINA.
SHE IS GONNA DIE!

06:03.096 --> 06:07.067
YEAH, IT WARMS MY HEART
TO SEE YOUR MOTHER'S
LAST WISHES COME TRUE.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.537
OH, WHAT, THAT I'M
GONNA HAVE A BIG BLOW-UP
WITH MY DAUGHTER

06:09.570 --> 06:13.073
AND MY BROTHER'S
GOING ON A WEEK-LONG
DRINKING BINGE?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.042
YOU JUST CAN'T LET
AN OLD MAN BE HAPPY

06:15.075 --> 06:17.044
FOR EVEN A MINUTE,
CAN YOU?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.913
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THE CHUTZPAH
ON THAT GIRL?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.148
IT'S UNREAL. LIKE WE
GOT NOTHIN' BETTER

06:21.181 --> 06:22.149
TO SPEND OUR MONEY ON?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.485
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
BUYING A NEW WATER HEATER.

06:24.518 --> 06:28.121
YOU KNOW, LILY'S
SKI TRIP IS GONNA
LAST, LIKE, A WEEK.

06:28.155 --> 06:31.124
A NEW WATER HEATER WILL
LAST, LIKE, 30 YEARS.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.826
UNTIL WE ARE 60.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.028
Sean: OOH, OHH.
Claudia: HEH.

06:35.062 --> 06:35.963
YEAH, WE'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.065
IT'LL FEEL GOOD
TO DO SOMETHING
SENSIBLE.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.703
OH, MY SWEET GOD.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.810
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:49.843 --> 06:51.745
YEAH, CAN I SEE
THAT GUITAR?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.146
SURE. SEE IT?

06:53.180 --> 06:55.649
NO, MAN, CAN I PLAY IT?

06:55.683 --> 06:57.518
I DON'T SEE
THAT HAPPENING.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.786
I MIGHT BUY IT.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.787
I THINK
YOU BETTER
LEAVE NOW.

06:59.820 --> 07:04.458
EXCUSE ME. IS--IS THERE
SOMETHING UP YOUR BUTT?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.561
LOOK, THIS GUY
AND HIS BROTHER,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.096
THE STONER
WITH THE CRAZY HAIR,

07:09.129 --> 07:13.066
HAVE BEEN COMING
IN HERE ONCE A MONTH
FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.469
THEY PLAY THE GUITARS...

07:16.637 --> 07:18.772
THEY SMUDGE THE GUITARS...

07:22.075 --> 07:24.211
THEY DO NOT
BUY THE GUITARS.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.013
I DON'T
THINK SO.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.481
IT'S TOO TINNY.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.983
HE BOUGHT A FLUTAPHONE
HERE LAST WEEK.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.218
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

07:31.251 --> 07:35.022
I JUST RECENTLY CAME
INTO A RATHER LARGE
FAMILY INHERITANCE,

07:35.055 --> 07:37.257
AND I WOULDN'T
WANT TO HAVE
TO SPEND THIS MONEY

07:37.290 --> 07:40.060
ON A WATER HEATER.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.500
JUST DON'T
SMUDGE IT.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.201
I'LL TRY.

07:57.044 --> 07:57.911
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.747
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
MARRIED A ROCK STAR.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.182
YOU ALREADY DID.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.753
OHH, YES!

08:05.786 --> 08:07.921
WE'RE SO GETTING
THIS GUITAR.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.790
WHAT ABOUT
THE WATER HEATER?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.291
I'LL TAKE COLD SHOWERS.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.261
I WILL NEED COLD SHOWERS.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.140
RING IT UP!

08:31.579 --> 08:32.546
I DON'T SEE IT.

08:32.580 --> 08:37.284
OH, HE LOOKS TOTALLY SEXY
WHEN HE PLAYS GUITAR.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.154
HE MAKES
THE WRONG FACE.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.094
HE LOOKS LIKE
A DRUNK BEAR.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.131
EXACTLY.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.033
HEY, MOM,
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.068
OH, WE'VE GOT SOME
LEFTOVER MEATLOAF,
I THINK.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.271
I TOLD YOU TO EAT MORE
MEATLOAF LAST NIGHT.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.172
I WAS FULL!

08:59.206 --> 08:59.907
I HATE LEFTOVERS.

08:59.940 --> 09:00.874
DOWN IN N'AWLINS,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.343
YOU ADD SOME SPICE AND RICE
TO YOUR LEFTOVERS,

09:03.376 --> 09:07.615
YOU DONE DID YOURSELF
SOME JAMBALAYA. HOO-EE!

09:08.381 --> 09:09.349
LET'S GET YOU
SOME DINNER.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.852
NO, NO, YOU SET YOURSELF
DOWN THERE, PRETTY LADY,

09:11.885 --> 09:12.820
YOU YOUNG'UNS
PLANT YOUR BOTTOMS.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.254
I'M GONNA REACH IN HERE,
GET SOME CHICKEN OUT,

09:14.287 --> 09:15.923
I'M GONNA WORK SOME
VOODOO ON THAT BIRD.

09:15.956 --> 09:19.593
YOU BOYS ARE GONNA
GET YOURSELVES
A TASTE OF N'AWLINS.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.596
OK, WAIT, STOP IT.
TIME OUT, ALL RIGHT?

09:22.630 --> 09:25.198
SAY "NEW ORLEANS."
"NEW ORLEANS."

09:25.232 --> 09:27.334
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THEY SAY IT.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.102
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.137
SOMEONE PUNCHED YOU
IN THE FACE

09:30.170 --> 09:32.806
'CAUSE YOU WERE WALKIN'
AROUND SAYING "N'AWLINS."

09:32.840 --> 09:33.573
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.175
THIS WAS JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

09:35.208 --> 09:39.246
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
OH, MA CHéRIE,

09:39.279 --> 09:42.249
SHOW US YOUR GOODIES.
SHOW US YOUR GOODIES.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.218
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
REALLY ONLY ALLOWED TO SAY

09:45.252 --> 09:49.289
THAT KIND OF A THING
TO A WOMAN DURING MARDI GRAS.

09:49.322 --> 09:53.093
OH. THAT'S
GOOD TO KNOW.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.363
HEY, MAN, IF YOU
REALLY WANT A WOMAN
TO TAKE HER TOP OFF,

09:56.396 --> 09:59.266
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS THIS...

10:01.434 --> 10:04.271
OK, YOU'RE NOT SEXY.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.707
THE LEAD GUITARIST
IS THE SEXY ONE.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.208
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU ONLY PLAYED
LEAD GUITAR

10:08.241 --> 10:10.043
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
REMEMBER THE SONGS.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.244
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I WASN'T SEXY.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.281
THE LADIES COULDN'T
TAKE THEIR EYES OFF ME.
YOU KNOW WHY?

10:14.314 --> 10:17.050
PITY?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.652
SHOWMANSHIP.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.377
WHOO!

10:55.322 --> 10:57.891
MAN, THAT WAS COOL.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.060
IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING
WAS IN SLOW MOTION.

11:00.093 --> 11:04.031
WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

11:04.064 --> 11:06.366
YOU SMASHED
MY GUITAR.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.302
I WASN'T
GONNA SMASH MINE.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.841
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
I GOT THIS LES PAUL,
IT'S ALL BEHIND US.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.844
GOD, I'D LOVE
TO SMASH A LES PAUL.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.879
SO WOULD LILY.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.023
ALL RIGHT, WHAT SONG
DO YOU GUYS WANNA HEAR?

11:30.057 --> 11:32.259
GENIE
IN A BOTTLE
HAMSTERDANCE.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.260
THE REAL
SLIM SHADY.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.461
Henry:
HAMSTERDANCE!

11:34.494 --> 11:36.129
HAMSTERDANCE! I WANNA
HEAR HAMSTERDANCE!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.130
LARGER
THAN LIFE.

11:37.164 --> 11:41.134
WHOA, UH, WAIT, DID
SOMEONE SAY IRON MAN?

11:48.441 --> 11:52.345
I AM IRON MAN!

11:53.346 --> 11:55.883
NICE GUITAR.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.050
WHOSE IS IT?

11:57.084 --> 11:59.419
UH, MINE.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.388
OH, MY GOD.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.992
YOU SPENT
MY SKI-TRIP MONEY
ON A GUITAR!

12:05.025 --> 12:08.061
AH, OH, HO HO HO,
THAT WASN'T SKI-TRIP MONEY.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.297
YES! YOU SAID
IF WE HAD
THE MONEY,

12:10.330 --> 12:11.264
I COULD GO
ON THE SKI TRIP.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.800
NO, I DIDN'T. I SAID
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.002
NOT THAT IF WE HAD
THE MONEY, YOU COULD GO.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.236
WELL,
YOU IMPLIED IT.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.139
NO, YOU MAY HAVE
INFERRED IT, BUT I
CERTAINLY DIDN'T IMPLY IT.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.140
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.776
WELL, "INFER" MEANS
TO GATHER--
I DON'T CARE!

12:22.810 --> 12:24.945
YOU HAVE
RUINED MY LIFE!

12:24.978 --> 12:27.380
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU RUINED MY LIFE, MISSY,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.348
BECAUSE IF
IT WASN'T FOR YOU,

12:28.381 --> 12:31.251
I WOULD HAVE HAD A GUITAR
LIKE THIS YEARS AGO!

12:31.284 --> 12:32.953
THAT'S NOT HOW
I WOULD HAVE HANDLED IT.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.956
OH, REALLY? HOW WOULD
YOU HAVE HANDLED IT?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.926
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD KIDS.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.127
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.898
THIS CHICKEN'S GONNA
THINK IT DONE DIED
AND WENT TO HEAVEN.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.034
IT DID DIE.

12:47.067 --> 12:47.901
Walt: HELLO!

12:47.935 --> 12:50.938
HEY, COME AND SEE
WHAT I GOT, EVERYBODY.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.506
THIS IS REALLY GREAT.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.374
HEY.
HEY.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.476
AH! WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.545
UH, HE MET A GIRL
IN NEW ORLEANS.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.514
I SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT
YOU BOYS TO BOX.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.817
HEY, I HELD
MY OWN.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.352
Eddie: HEY!

13:05.385 --> 13:07.454
HYAH!

13:08.421 --> 13:11.558
I AM VERY PROUD.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.461
SO, WHERE'S
MY GRANDDAUGHTER?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.296
LILY!

13:17.197 --> 13:17.865
WHAT'S THAT?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.467
IT'S A GENUINE
FLEXIBLE FLYER.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.268
WHAT'S IT FOR?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.370
WELL, I KNOW HOW
DISAPPOINTED YOU ARE

13:23.403 --> 13:25.505
THAT YOU CAN'T
GO SKIING,

13:25.538 --> 13:26.639
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.576
TOMORROW, YOU AND ME
GET UP AT 6:00,
JUMP IN THE CADDY,

13:29.609 --> 13:33.881
AND BY LUNCHTIME, WE'RE
SLEDDING IN THE POCONOS.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.949
I WANTED TO GO SKIING
WITH CUTE BOYS.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.586
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
SLEDDING WITH AN OLD...

13:39.619 --> 13:41.154
YOU.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.091
WELL, IF THAT'S
YOUR ATTITUDE,
YOUNG LADY,

13:44.124 --> 13:45.458
I JUST MAY NOT
TAKE YOU.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.527
GOOD.
I DON'T WANNA GO.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.497
I JUST WANTED
TO HANG OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.498
ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.401
THERE'S ROOM IN THE CADDY
FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.204
NO! UGH! I HATE
THIS FAMILY!

13:57.237 --> 13:59.973
I WISH I'D BEEN
PUT UP FOR ADOPTION!

14:00.007 --> 14:02.475
YOU ALMOST WERE.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.477
WALT!

14:04.511 --> 14:05.578
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,

14:05.612 --> 14:08.415
Y'ALL SET YOURSELF

DELECTIMOUS CHICKEN.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.318
OH, COME ON, EDDIE.
THAT CHICKEN'S BURNT
BEYOND RECOGNITION.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.654
IT'S BLACKENED
BEYOND RECOGNITION.
NOW, YOU TASTE THAT UP.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.489
CAN I HAVE
SOME KETCHUP?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.925
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.460
THAT'LL RUIN
THE FLAVOR.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.328
BUT IT'S DRY.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.996
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S
BECAUSE ALL THE JUICES

14:23.030 --> 14:25.465
ARE LOCKED UP INSIDE.
I GUARANTEE.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.968
WHY IS HE TALKIN'

14:36.309 --> 14:38.545
ROAD KILL. SHE SMELLS

14:38.578 --> 14:39.612
Lily: YEP.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.114
SEAN, WHY DON'T
YOU TELL HIM WHY

14:41.148 --> 14:43.650
MY GRANDDAUGHTER
SMELLS LIKE DEAD ANIMALS?

14:43.683 --> 14:44.751
HEY,
I AIN'T ASHAMED.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.553
YOU REMEMBER THAT
CRAZY BUTCHER DOWN
ON HOPE STREET?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.255
THE ONE WITH THE SAMPLES?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.257
AH, KIDS,
HAVE A FREE SAMPLE.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.026
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE ALLOWED
TO EAT FREE MEAT.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.295
YOU'LL LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.464
GO ON, EDDIE.
EAT IT.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.565
WHY DO I
HAVE TO EAT IT?

14:58.598 --> 14:59.599
IT'S GOOD
FOR YOU!

14:59.632 --> 15:00.567
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:00.600 --> 15:05.472
BECAUSE IF YOU
DON'T EAT IT,
I'LL SMACK YOU.

15:11.444 --> 15:15.348
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
DAD AND I POPPED IN THERE
TO PICK UP A ROAST.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.617
COME ON, DAD,
I DON'T LIKE RUMP ROAST.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.219
I LIKE
STANDING RIB ROAST.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.021
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WON THE LOTTERY.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.623
LOOK, LOOK,
IT'S ONLY 29 CENTS
MORE A POUND,

15:23.656 --> 15:27.127
AND I'M WORTH IT.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.684
MAY I HELP YOU?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.254
SHE GOT A JOB?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.090
YEAH, MY LITTLE
BABY GRANDDAUGHTER,
COVERED IN BLOOD.

15:57.124 --> 16:01.394
HEY, SHE ONLY
DID THAT TO TRY
AND GET MY GOAT.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.495
IS THERE

16:02.529 --> 16:04.331
I CAN GRIND UP

OH, JEEZ.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.633
COME ON, LILY.
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PROVE?

16:06.666 --> 16:07.300

16:07.334 --> 16:08.301
COME ON! SHE'S
JUST CARRYING

16:08.335 --> 16:11.238
THIS PIG'S HEAD

SORRY FOR HER.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.105
HOW DO YOU

16:12.139 --> 16:14.474
UH, DID ANYONE HERE
ORDER A PIG'S HEAD?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.509
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU

16:16.543 --> 16:19.579

16:19.612 --> 16:21.381
YOU DON'T KILL
CHICKENS HERE!

16:21.414 --> 16:23.616

16:23.650 --> 16:26.586
FINE. STANDING

16:26.619 --> 16:28.055
OH, HOW CAN YOU
MAKE HER WORK HERE?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.122
Sean:
I'M NOT MAKING
HER WORK HERE!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.323
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT SHE'S
DOING?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.258
SHE'S TRYING
TO MAKE ME
FEEL GUILTY

16:31.291 --> 16:33.593
ABOUT THE GUITAR
SO THAT SHE
CAN GO SKIING.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.128
WELL, IF YOU WON'T
GIVE ME THE MONEY--

16:35.162 --> 16:36.663
WELL, I'M NOT.
HELL, I'LL GIVE
HER THE MONEY.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.466
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER,
AND YOU GOT...

16:39.499 --> 16:42.035
PORK. I HAVE PORK

16:42.069 --> 16:43.303
OH, SO YOU
ALREADY KNEW.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.739
LITTLE GIRL, I PAY YOU
TO SWEEP UP, NOT TALK
TO THE CUSTOMERS.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.643
MISS, YOU FORGOT
YOUR PIG'S HEAD.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.013
TRY THIS.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.683
Butcher: THERE.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.485
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
THE OLD MILL CLOSED.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.321
YOU COULD HAVE HER
WORKING THERE, TOO.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.489
OH, I SUPPOSE
WHEN I WAS A KID,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.125
YOU WOULD HAVE
GIVEN ME 500 BUCKS
TO GO ON SOME SKI TRIP.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.659
I NEVER LEFT YOU
WANTIN' FOR ANYTHING.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.696
EXCUSE ME,
I BELIEVE EVERY DAY
OF MY CHILDHOOD

17:09.729 --> 17:11.331
I ASKED FOR A DOG.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.467
HALF THE TIME
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
BATHE YOURSELF.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.404
YOU EXPECT ME
TO GET YOU A DOG?

17:17.437 --> 17:18.805
AND I WANTED
A TELESCOPE.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.375
YEAH, JUST ONE MORE THING
FOR YOU TO TURN INTO A BONG.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.377
WHAT ARE YOU
PICKIN' ON ME FOR?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.512
HE'S THE ONE
WHO BOUGHT THE GUITAR.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.348
HEY, HEY, MOM
WOULD HAVE WANTED ME
TO HAVE THAT GUITAR.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.416
SHE ALWAYS SAID
I HAD TALENT.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.520
YEAH, AND SHE TOLD
EDDIE HE COULD BE
AN ASTRONAUT.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.721
I COULD'VE BEEN.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.822
YOU GET CARSICK.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.525
THAT'S BECAUSE
OF THE GRAVITY.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.795
MOM, WHAT SHOULD I
USE ON BLOODSTAINS?

17:42.829 --> 17:45.832
REALLY BIG
BLOODSTAINS?

17:45.865 --> 17:48.668
I DON'T KNOW. WISK?

17:48.701 --> 17:51.104

18:07.787 --> 18:09.756
WE'RE KEEPING
THE GUITAR.

18:09.789 --> 18:13.326
WHY, BECAUSE
IT MAKES YOU HOT?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.564
YES, BECAUSE
IT MAKES ME HOT.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.733
'CAUSE IT MAKES
YOUR MOTHER HOT.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.203
OK, THAT'S GROSS.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.173
WELL, YOU'RE
LUCKY YOUR DAD

18:26.206 --> 18:27.274

BUT I AM HERE, SO
WE CAN STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT, OK?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.580
Lily: LOOK...

18:34.314 --> 18:39.286
THAT GUITAR TAKES US
BACK TO A TIME
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG

18:39.319 --> 18:42.755
AND STUPID
AND WE LIKED IT.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.125

18:47.360 --> 18:52.732
COME ON. YOU GOTTA GIVE US

19:23.796 --> 19:26.499
YOU WIN.
I GIVE UP.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.669
YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR STUPID
GUITAR.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.939
GOOD. I WAS
PLANNING ON IT.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.941
FINE.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.477
WHY THE SUDDEN
CHANGE OF HEART?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.413
LOOK, HOW AM I SUPPOSED

19:40.447 --> 19:44.617
KNOWING YOU'RE SITTING

19:44.651 --> 19:46.686
I'D FEEL TOO GUILTY.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.688
THANKS FOR
RUINING IT FOR ME.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.423
DOES THIS MEAN
WE'RE GOING SLEDDING?

19:50.457 --> 19:52.859
Lily:
NO, IT DOES NOT!

19:53.260 --> 19:59.599
THIS IS GOOD. THIS
IS GOOD. SHE'S LEARNING,
SHE'S GROWING.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.370
GOOD.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.944
DAMN IT! DAMN IT,

20:14.714 --> 20:17.717
WHAT?
I CAN'T KEEP
THIS GUITAR NOW.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.453
I'LL FEEL GUILTY
EVERY TIME I PICK IT UP.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.589
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING SKIING.

20:22.622 --> 20:26.225
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
KEEP THIS GUITAR.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.895
YOU KNOW...

20:29.996 --> 20:31.998
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
GET A WATER HEATER, THEN.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.268
SOMETHING THE WHOLE
FAMILY CAN USE.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.403
FINE.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.878
YEAH.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.015

CALL KRISTINA!

21:01.528 --> 21:03.396
SHE IS GONNA
COMPLETELY DIE!

21:03.430 --> 21:06.733
