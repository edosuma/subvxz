    A DEFINITE SPARK, OKAY?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.449
      SHE'S JUST TOO BUSY
 FOR A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.451
      - SHE BLEW YOU OFF.
     TOTAL BLOW-OFF. ANDY?

06:26.453 --> 06:28.754
     - WELL, IT MIGHT BE--

06:28.756 --> 06:30.956
         WHO LAY AROUND
  PLAYING VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY

06:30.958 --> 06:33.759
  AND LIE ABOUT WRITING SONGS
       FOR MICHAEL BUBLE.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.926

06:34.928 --> 06:36.561
          MARCUS DID.
      I JUST CONFIRMED IT.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.531
        TO THE HOSPITAL
    AND TELL HER THE TRUTH?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.600
   - THE TRUTH? THAT I WROTE
A CHRISTMAS SONG EIGHT YEARS AGO

06:41.602 --> 06:44.903
   HONESTLY, ANDY, YOU'D HAVE
   A BETTER CHANCE WITH HER.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.105
        - ANDY'S TAKEN.
 I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU STRAY.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.408
        I WILL KILL YOU.
  - WOMEN CRAVE HONESTY, WILL.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.677

   YOU'RE STARTING TO EVOLVE.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.679

06:54.681 --> 06:55.981

06:55.983 --> 06:58.817
  WOW, MAN. I'M REALLY BLOWING
       MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.051
      - I'M ON THE GRAVEL.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.922
   WALKING DOWN THE WALKWAY,
      GOING UP THE STAIRS.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.857
       ALL RIGHT, MOTHER,
  I'M SAFELY ON OUR PROPERTY.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.627

07:08.629 --> 07:10.529
            [sighs]

07:10.531 --> 07:13.498
   - ¶ IT'S GETTING BETTER ¶

07:13.500 --> 07:16.535

           SURPRISE.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.605
        IT'S YOUR MUMMY.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.576
   I FIGURED OUT A WAY FOR US
  TO BE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.811
       ISN'T THAT GREAT?

07:25.813 --> 07:27.746
           - IT'S...

07:27.748 --> 07:29.648
        IT'S JUST GREAT.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.083
  - AND I LEFT YOU SOME PRECUT
   ORANGE WEDGES RIGHT THERE.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.552
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CUT ANYTHING.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.053
  I HID ALL THE KNIVES ANYWAY.
            [laughs]

07:35.055 --> 07:37.222
      DON'T LOOK FOR THEM.

07:40.693 --> 07:44.496
           - [sighs]

07:44.498 --> 07:45.864
          - I TOLD HIM
     HE COULDN'T STAY HERE,

07:45.866 --> 07:48.700
        BUT THEN HE SAID
      HE LOVED MY COFFEE.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.936
      - YOU ARE TOO EASY.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.138
   IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
    WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.740

            - YEAH.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.711
       LOOK, I APOLOGIZE.
          I WAS RUDE.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.681
 - BUT THE FACT THAT YOU WRITE
          FOR SOMEBODY

08:02.683 --> 08:03.915
          WHO CONNECTS
     WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE,

08:03.917 --> 08:05.217
    IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

08:05.219 --> 08:09.521
   - I MEAN, MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
 BUBLE ISN'T EXACTLY MY TASTE,

08:09.523 --> 08:12.657
      BUT, I MEAN, YOU'RE
   A PROFESSIONAL SONGWRITER.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.126
  IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE WRITING
    JINGLES FOR DOG-FOOD ADS

08:15.128 --> 08:17.529
     OR SOME ONE-HIT WONDER
         OR SOMETHING.

           YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A WORKING PROFESSIONAL...

08:24.571 --> 08:27.038
      SO DID YOU COME HERE
     TO PLAY ME SOMETHING?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.740
    - YOU KNOW, IT CAN WAIT.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.675
 I JUST--I'M NOT REALLY FEELING
  THE ACOUSTICS OF THIS ROOM.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.277
      IT FEELS FLAT TO ME.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.945
             ¶ AH ¶
  YEAH, IT'S--IT'S VERY FLAT.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.647
 - COME ON, PLAY ME SOMETHING.
          - IT'S LATE.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.616
   THERE ARE PEOPLE SLEEPING.
         I DON'T KNOW.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.518
     - THERE'S ONLY ROOM 6,
  AND SHE'S KNOCKED OUT, SO...

08:39.520 --> 08:41.886
 SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN,
        MAYBE NOT BUBLE.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.089
          - [chuckles]
             OKAY.

        - RIVER SHIVER.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.265

        - BECK WAS BECK.
   - IT'S THE WORK OF GENIUS.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.833

   WHAT "EXISTENTIAL" MEANS?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.468
          - DOES WILL?

12:50.470 --> 12:53.238
         I AM A CAPTIVE
     IN MY OWN HOUSE, WILL.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.141
  I WENT FROM LIMITED FREEDOM
     TO COMPLETE LOCKDOWN,

12:56.143 --> 12:58.143
          ALL BECAUSE
     OF ONE SELF-STABBING.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.277
     - MARCUS, IF YOU WANT
          YOUR MOTHER

12:59.279 --> 13:00.912
  TO THINK THAT YOU'RE MATURE,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.247
      YOU GOT TO TELL HER
         HOW YOU FEEL.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.150
     YOU GOT TO SAY, LIKE,
        YOU KNOW, THAT--

13:05.152 --> 13:07.085
        THAT SHE'S IN--
     THAT SHE'S INCREDIBLE,

13:07.087 --> 13:08.787
  I MEAN, THAT YOU NEVER FELT
            THIS WAY

13:08.789 --> 13:10.021
   ABOUT ANYONE BEFORE, EVER.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.489
       - HE'S NOT TALKING
    ABOUT YOUR MOM ANYMORE.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.092
 - THANK YOU, CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.195
           - SO HOW'S
   MY FAVORITE PATIENT DOING?

13:17.197 --> 13:18.563
            - I'M--
   - HE'S A BIT CONSTIPATED.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.865

     BUT YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.846
          INTO A STATE
     OF OVERPROTECTIVENESS.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.114
        - SOUNDS ROUGH.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.082
   SO, UM, HOW IS WILL DOING?

13:38.084 --> 13:40.018
       - JUST AS AMAZING
      AS EVERY OTHER DAY.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.086
     - HE IS PRETTY GREAT,
           ISN'T HE?

         - WAIT, WAIT.
   WHO'S GREAT? WHO'S GREAT?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.089
            - WILL.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.991
IT'S LIKE WHEN WE WERE DREAMING
   WHO WE WOULD LIVE NEXT TO,

13:46.993 --> 13:48.226
    WE DIDN'T KNOW TO DREAM
           THIS BIG.

   HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.

          AND RIVVERS.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.542

          THAT RIVVERS
   MIGHT BE SINGING ONE DAY.

            AT WORK.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.389
       - NO, NO, DARLING,
        THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.390
      - IT'S TOTALLY TRUE.
     - IT IS, VERY MUCH SO.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.227
 - WELL, MAYBE IT'S A BIT TRUE.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.862
   SO, I MEAN, IS IT A CRIME
        TO WANT TO SPEND

18:17.864 --> 18:20.364
          ALL MY TIME
      WITH MY LITTLE BABY?

    HE'S HERE FOR MY COFFEE.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.266

18:55.268 --> 18:58.302
     AND I HAVEN'T WRITTEN
        ANYTHING SINCE.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.904
 THERE'S A MILLION EXCUSES WHY,

18:59.906 --> 19:02.140
      BUT THE REAL REASON
   I HAVEN'T WRITTEN ANYTHING

19:02.142 --> 19:03.841
       IS THAT I'M JUST--
           I'M SCARED

19:03.843 --> 19:06.244
           THAT, UM--
         THAT I'LL FAIL

19:06.246 --> 19:08.212

19:10.315 --> 19:11.816

          - ANYWAY...

19:18.258 --> 19:20.558
       I JUST WANTED YOU
         TO KNOW THAT,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.661
  'CAUSE I REALLY HAVEN'T TOLD
 ANYONE THAT BEFORE EXCEPT YOU

19:23.663 --> 19:28.299
  AND ALL THESE DRUNK, SICKLY,
      AND INJURED PEOPLE.

19:28.301 --> 19:31.636

19:31.638 --> 19:34.338
  I LIKE YOU A LOT, AND I HOPE
 YOU'LL GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.375
     OH, AND YOU WANTED ME
TO SING YOU A SONG THAT I WROTE.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.450
         ¶ AFTER SCHOOL
        ONE WINTER DAY ¶

19:46.452 --> 19:48.753
        ¶ I CAME ACROSS
       A BIG RED SLEIGH ¶

19:48.755 --> 19:53.457
         ¶ BROKEN DOWN
        ON HIGHWAY 63 ¶

19:53.459 --> 19:56.360
          ¶ CURSING IT
      WITH ALL HIS MIGHT ¶

19:56.362 --> 19:58.462
       ¶ A MAN WHOSE FACE
       I KNEW ON SIGHT ¶

19:58.464 --> 20:00.631
     - HE WROTE THIS SONG.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.267
     - ¶ AND SMILE AT ME ¶

20:03.269 --> 20:05.636
         ¶ I'M GUESSING
     YOU ARE NINE OR TEN ¶

20:05.638 --> 20:07.905
        ¶ AND I CAN FLY
       MY SLEIGH AGAIN ¶

20:07.907 --> 20:12.743
        ¶ IF YOU FIND IT
   IN YOUR HEART TO BELIEVE ¶

20:12.745 --> 20:14.779
              all:
       ¶ WON'T YOU RIDE ¶

20:14.781 --> 20:17.348
   ¶ IN MY RUNAWAY SLEIGH? ¶

20:17.350 --> 20:19.984
         ¶ THE REINDEER
       MIGHT BE BITING ¶

20:19.986 --> 20:22.286
¶ BUT THEY STILL KNOW THE WAY ¶

20:22.288 --> 20:24.355
        ¶ AND WE CAN FLY
        THESE PRESENTS ¶

20:24.357 --> 20:26.991
      ¶ TO THE GOOD GIRLS
         AND THE BOYS ¶

20:26.993 --> 20:28.793
     ¶ AND WE'LL ALL HAVE ¶

20:28.795 --> 20:30.294
     ¶ A MERRY CHRISTMAS ¶
       [PA system beeps]

20:30.296 --> 20:31.963
 - BLUE TEAM TO I.C.U. PLEASE.
       BLUE TEAM, I.C.U.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.531
       - THAT'S FOR YOU.
     YOU HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.532
            - OKAY.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.533
       - ¶ BUT EVEN SO ¶

20:35.535 --> 20:37.235
      ¶ IT GAVE ME PAUSE ¶

20:37.237 --> 20:41.339
  ¶ SOMETHING IN THIS PICTURE
       SEEMED SO WRONG ¶

20:41.341 --> 20:43.908
    ¶ HIS SUIT WAS WRINKLED,
        FULL OF HOLES ¶

20:43.910 --> 20:46.010
      ¶ HIS SHOES UNTIED,
     HIS CHEEKS HAD MOLES ¶

20:46.012 --> 20:51.482
    ¶ AND I SWEAR I SAW HIM
   SIPPING SOMETHING STRONG ¶

20:51.484 --> 20:53.351
              all:
       ¶ WON'T YOU RIDE ¶

20:53.353 --> 20:55.853
   ¶ IN MY RUNAWAY SLEIGH? ¶

20:55.855 --> 20:58.289
        ¶ WE'RE MISSING
       A FEW SEAT BELTS ¶

20:58.291 --> 21:00.758
         ¶ BUT HOLD ON,
       WE'RE ON OUR WAY ¶

21:00.760 --> 21:02.893
        ¶ AND WE CAN FLY
        THESE PRESENTS ¶

21:02.895 --> 21:04.996
      ¶ TO THE GOOD GIRLS
         AND THE BOYS ¶

21:04.998 --> 21:10.635
        ¶ AND WE'LL ALL
    HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS ¶

21:10.637 --> 21:11.636
            - YEAH!

21:11.638 --> 21:13.337
     [cheers and applause]

21:13.339 --> 21:15.840
            - WHOO!
          - WHOO-HOO!

21:15.842 --> 21:19.343
          - [retching]

21:19.345 --> 21:21.412
           - ORDERLY?

21:23.315 --> 21:25.383
