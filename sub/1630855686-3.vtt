00:08.884 --> 00:10.469
<i>Are they
ready?</i>

00:11.095 --> 00:13.097
<i>They'll have to be,
won't they?</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:14.807
<i>You and I walk
this path together.</i>

00:14.807 --> 00:16.392
We've never walked
this path together.

00:16.392 --> 00:19.145
<i>I swore myself to you
because I trusted you.</i>

00:19.145 --> 00:20.396
<i>You failed me.</i>

00:20.396 --> 00:22.064
<i>Alanna will see you
to the Tower.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.483
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

00:25.443 --> 00:26.736
<i>I don't want to hurt you.</i>

00:28.821 --> 00:30.156
<i>You can't.</i>

00:30.156 --> 00:31.907
<i>Logain Ablar,</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:34.368
<i>you will serve as an example</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:38.080
<i>to all men who dare to channel.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:40.082
There she is.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.209
<i>You've heard of the Arches?</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:43.836
<i>The trial novices
go through to become Accepted?</i>

00:43.836 --> 00:44.837
Is she ready?

00:45.796 --> 00:48.591
<i>She is ready
to leave behind what she was...</i>

00:48.591 --> 00:51.385
She could die in the Arches.
Many have before her.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.804
<i>Does she know
what she fears?</i>

00:56.307 --> 00:57.933
<i>She has
never faced them...</i>

00:57.933 --> 00:59.560
Nynaeve!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.312
<i>...but now
is willing.</i>

01:01.312 --> 01:03.397
<i>The hour waits for no woman.</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:14.200
What are they?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.495
Ter'angreal.

01:18.913 --> 01:22.625
- What do they do?
- Many things, child.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.836
They are from
before the Breaking,

01:25.836 --> 01:29.173
made during a time
when women could create objects

01:29.173 --> 01:31.759
from the One Power itself.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.803
Some ter'angreal

01:33.803 --> 01:36.680
are made to work by Aes Sedai,
like this one.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.182
Others do what they do

01:38.182 --> 01:40.142
simply with the presence
of any woman who can channel.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.644
We don't know
why they were made.

01:41.644 --> 01:44.688
Most, we've learned
at great cost to avoid.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.484
Many Aes Sedai have been killed
or burned out, learning that.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.861
And you want me
to just walk through them?

01:50.861 --> 01:52.696
We know what this one does.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.866
It will bring you face-to-face
with your greatest fears,

01:55.866 --> 01:58.869
and what those fears are,
are for you to know.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.747
And you need to tell
no more than you wish.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.582
So... what?

02:03.582 --> 02:06.418
I just walk through
one arch and out again?

02:06.418 --> 02:07.837
Three times through,
and it's done?

02:07.837 --> 02:10.756
If you wish
to boil it down that far...

02:10.756 --> 02:12.800
yes.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.301
Two things we will tell you

02:14.301 --> 02:17.847
now that no woman hears
until she is in this room.

02:17.847 --> 02:20.224
The first: once you begin,

02:20.224 --> 02:22.601
you must continue to the end.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.228
Refuse to go on,

02:24.228 --> 02:26.647
and you will be put
out of the Tower

02:26.647 --> 02:28.816
with enough silver
to support you for a year.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.068
But you will never be
allowed back.

02:32.695 --> 02:36.073
to seek, to strive,
is to know danger,

02:36.073 --> 02:38.534
and you will know danger here.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.203
Some women have entered,
and never come out.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.875
This is your last chance, child.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.169
You may turn back now,
right now,

02:49.169 --> 02:51.797
and you'll only have
one mark against you.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.383
Twice more you'll be
allowed to come here,

02:54.383 --> 02:57.177
and only on the third refusal
will you be put

02:57.177 --> 02:58.512
out of the Tower.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.516
I myself could not do it
the first time here.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.560
If you are doing this
for someone else,

03:04.560 --> 03:05.811
you will fail.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.479
Do this for you.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.648
Or not at all.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.406
I'm ready.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.867
Your dress.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.145
Whatever awaits you,

03:48.145 --> 03:51.148
you must face it with
nothing but your wits.

03:52.358 --> 03:55.194
Not even the One Power
will be available to you

03:55.194 --> 03:57.363
inside the Arches.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.254
The way back will come but once.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.487
There you are.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.698
Dad.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.367
Where did you get those?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.997
I don't know.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.291
I don't remember
how I got here...

05:40.090 --> 05:42.426
You have to be careful, sweetheart.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.136
Herbs can be dangerous.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.473
There. That should do it.

05:47.473 --> 05:48.932
Don't forget.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.185
Crimsonthorn roots are poisonous.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.519
Remember, red is dead.

05:56.482 --> 05:57.483
What is that?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.622
Dad!

06:14.041 --> 06:15.918
Take them down!

06:23.550 --> 06:25.427
No!

06:26.303 --> 06:27.554
No!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.121
Mum!

06:52.121 --> 06:54.123
- Nynaeve, you're hurt.
- Elnore!

06:54.123 --> 06:56.458
- Come on.
- Run.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.468
Go on.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.678
The cellar.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.566
I need you to be

07:20.566 --> 07:22.109
a brave girl now.
Whatever happens,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.735
you have to be very quiet
and stay down here.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.903
I can help you, Dad.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.157
We shall
go into the land...

07:28.157 --> 07:30.409
...so our children can
always hold us...

07:30.409 --> 07:33.412
...and will never be alone.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.999
Beerien!

07:36.999 --> 07:39.126
Wait, Dad!

07:46.133 --> 07:49.052
<i>The way back
will come but once...</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:01.899
Mum!

08:12.242 --> 08:13.493
Come here!

08:37.601 --> 08:40.229
You are washed clean
of your sins.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.856
And the sins committed
against you.

08:42.856 --> 08:47.110
You come to us pure,
in heart and soul.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.788
It was so real...

08:59.790 --> 09:02.334
- Was it real?
- No one knows.

09:07.798 --> 09:08.924
Some come out

09:08.924 --> 09:11.885
bearing the actual wounds
taken inside.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.429
Others are cut
to the bone inside

09:14.429 --> 09:16.974
and come back without a mark.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.942
If I save them,
would it change things?

09:26.942 --> 09:29.069
Once you begin you
must continue.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.790
The way back will come but once.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.876
Nynaeve?

10:25.876 --> 10:27.336
Tam.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.006
What's wrong?
What's happening here?

10:31.006 --> 10:33.133
A fever.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.635
It spread through
the Two Rivers after you left.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.977
Who gave you these herbs?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.771
The Wisdom.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.566
Natti Cauthon?

10:50.567 --> 10:52.069
Why does Tam
call you Wisdom?

10:52.069 --> 10:54.321
You've been gone
a long time, Nynaeve.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.907
- You don't understand
what these herbs can do.
- You abandoned us.

10:56.907 --> 11:00.786
I may not be a Wisdom,
but I'm the one who stayed.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.704
It's a painless death.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.374
The Aes Sedai can heal this.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.542
They can heal anything short
of death. I've... I've seen it.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.794
The Amyrlin will...

11:08.794 --> 11:10.670
We wrote to
your Amyrlin Seat months ago.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.255
You're the first
"sister" I've seen.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.384
There has to be another way.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.594
- We can't...
- Don't judge me, girl.

11:17.594 --> 11:22.265
Your job was to protect us,
and you left us.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.393
If you can heal them,
then do it.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.728
Otherwise,
go back to your Tower.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.815
This isn't your home anymore.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.203
You're going to be all right.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.900
It's all right.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.570
It's good to see your face.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.447
You've been missed.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.366
I'm sorry.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.160
How is Rand?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.870
Is he happy?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.958
He is.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.377
Thank you
for keeping him safe.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.257
Will you stay with me until
the herbs have done their work?

12:41.136 --> 12:44.514
I can't tell you what a comfort
it is to see your face.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.436
<i>The way back
will come but once.</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:56.109
- Nynaeve?
- I'm coming back, all right?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.527
Please don't go.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.446
I promise you.
I'm coming back.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.072
Nynaeve. Nynaeve!

13:02.115 --> 13:03.950
You are washed clean
of your sins.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.160
- And the sins...
- No!

13:05.160 --> 13:06.786
No! We need to go.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.498
Please. To the Two Rivers.
There's a plague there.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.082
Something we could all fix.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.126
Every woman's fears
are her own property.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.503
Do not burden us with them.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.047
You are washed clean
of your sins.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.924
And the sins committed
against you.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.468
- You come to us...
- We need to go. Please.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.179
Once you begin,
you must continue.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.893
The way back

13:29.893 --> 13:32.562
will come but once.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.235
<i>You're a remarkable woman, Wisdom.</i>

14:21.444 --> 14:24.364
<i>As beautiful
as the sun.</i>

14:26.116 --> 14:28.535
<i>As fierce as a warrior.</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:31.871
<i>You are a lioness, Wisdom...</i>

14:43.633 --> 14:45.051
What happened?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.930
I don't remember what I did.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.228
You are washed clean
of your sins.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.023
And the sins committed
against you.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.027
Why can't I remember?

15:07.824 --> 15:10.660
It's all right.
The blood isn't yours.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.503
- Lan!
- Sometimes it's best
not to remember.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.796
Well done, child.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.634
You come to us
pure in heart and soul.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.552
You are Nynaeve al'Meara,

15:27.552 --> 15:30.263
Accepted of the White Tower.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.183
You are sealed to us now.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.226
No.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.646
No!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.441
What did I do in that last Arch?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.443
What did you make me do?!

15:43.443 --> 15:46.029
Your fears are
your own property, child.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.156
I'm not like you.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.994
If this test is about turning
my back on the people I love,

15:52.994 --> 15:55.580
the people who trust me
to take care of them,

15:55.580 --> 15:56.998
if being an Aes Sedai means

15:56.998 --> 15:59.334
trusting the Tower
over everything

15:59.334 --> 16:00.752
and everyone else, I won't.

16:00.752 --> 16:01.753
Never.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.962
Nynaeve...

16:02.962 --> 16:06.257
Keep your ring.
I'm not your sister.

16:09.219 --> 16:13.181
If you leave this room, you will
never be allowed to return.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.363
You can't leave.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.783
I need you.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.744
You don't.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.875
I came here for you, Egwene.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.252
To protect you.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.004
But the truth is,
you don't need my protection.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.383
I can see that now.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.430
I guess I learned
something here after all.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.770
Do you know what Aes Sedai means
in the Old Tongue?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.483
"Servants of all."

17:05.483 --> 17:09.028
You're gonna be a woman who's
actually worthy of that title.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.742
An Aes Sedai who makes me proud
of the months I spent here.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.832
I'm going to miss you
so much.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.500
What are you doing here?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.169
Alanna told me you were
going through the Arches.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.087
I came as fast as I could.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.466
I couldn't do it.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.761
Where will you go?

18:16.221 --> 18:18.097
Home.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.891
To the Two Rivers.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.518
I don't know what's left
for me there,

18:21.518 --> 18:23.061
but I know I don't belong here.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.063
I could come with you.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.817
If you'll have me.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.656
What about Moiraine?
The bond?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.580
Of course I'll have you.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.510
<i>The way back
will come but once.</i>

18:59.013 --> 19:00.640
Are you all right?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.602
I thought I heard something.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.605
Nynaeve?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.444
What's wrong?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.992
I don't know, I...

19:18.992 --> 19:21.661
It was a strange feeling.
Like this...

19:21.661 --> 19:23.580
This was all a dream.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.447
Nynaeve al'Meara has
made her choice.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.874
Alanna was right.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.834
She wasn't ready.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.171
We've lost women
to the Arches before.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.673
Some are just not up to
the task of wearing this ring.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.884
No. She trusted you.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.095
Trusted us,
and we got her killed.

20:21.095 --> 20:25.642
I hope your conscience never
lets you make peace with that.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.895
I know mine won't.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.056
Who are they?
What do they want?

21:07.392 --> 21:10.228
I have never read or heard
anything of these people.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.982
- No! Nana!
- No!

21:55.982 --> 21:57.233
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

21:57.233 --> 21:58.901
Where are you taking her?

21:58.901 --> 22:01.029
Nana!

22:02.488 --> 22:04.907
- Nana!
- Stop!

22:12.415 --> 22:14.375
People of Atuan's Mill,

22:14.375 --> 22:17.920
you have forgotten
your history.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.215
You squat on stolen land.

22:21.215 --> 22:24.218
Land which once belonged to us,

22:24.218 --> 22:27.138
and will be ours once again.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.032
When the fleet of
Luthair Paendrag

22:46.032 --> 22:48.076
crossed the Aryth Ocean,

22:48.076 --> 22:50.620
the return was promised.

22:50.620 --> 22:54.832
Today is that day.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.173
We have to do something.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.259
We can't just let them
take these girls.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.844
We're outnumbered and unarmed.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.888
No, we're not.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.682
Quiet.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.271
When you swear
the oaths and bow

23:17.271 --> 23:19.023
before the High Lady Suroth,

23:19.023 --> 23:22.026
the debt of your forefathers
shall be forgiven.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.487
You will share in the prosperity

23:24.487 --> 23:26.781
of the Seanchan's return,

23:26.781 --> 23:28.616
from Atuan's Mill to Falme,

23:28.616 --> 23:31.702
to our great empire
across the sea.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.047
Uno...

23:51.013 --> 23:53.850
Who will be the first
to swear the oaths

23:53.850 --> 23:57.103
and bow before
the High Lady Suroth,

23:57.103 --> 23:58.980
pledging fealty to the throne?

24:00.022 --> 24:01.107
This man.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.070
No, no, no.
Stop. Stop.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.824
Stop!
What are you doing to him?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.994
Stop! Stop!

24:21.878 --> 24:25.548
Avert your eyes
and kneel.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.885
You'd bloody well
like that, wouldn't you?

24:30.428 --> 24:34.849
Bend the knee
and swear the oaths.

24:43.733 --> 24:47.069
Feck you and your oaths.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.248
Those who will not
swear the oaths

24:59.248 --> 25:01.792
will have the oaths
sworn for them.

25:03.794 --> 25:06.297
To obey.
To await. To serve.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.064
No!

25:47.296 --> 25:52.551
All will bow.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.815
Our pride is not worth
more than our lives.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.909
Perrin...

26:18.953 --> 26:19.954
Perrin.

26:23.958 --> 26:27.336
I swear to obey.

26:27.336 --> 26:31.424
To await. And to serve.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.384
I swear to obey.

26:33.384 --> 26:36.846
To await. And to serve.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
I can see red at your roots.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.971
You keep your hair short

27:18.971 --> 27:21.766
but you can't hide
what you really are.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.855
So, when is the other boy
coming back?

27:27.855 --> 27:30.566
I told you,
there was an accident.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.735
I'll be looking after you
from now on.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.028
Lucky you.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.907
You know, the last boy used to
bring me red wine with dinner,

27:37.907 --> 27:40.117
just to cover the taste
of these sour oats.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.869
This is all
we're allowed to give you.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.579
It's for your own safety.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.503
How long are you going to wait?

27:52.338 --> 27:53.672
I'm sorry?

27:53.672 --> 27:58.260
Before you ask me
what you want to ask me.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.553
A few days?

28:01.972 --> 28:03.099
A few weeks?

28:03.099 --> 28:04.558
It must have taken you months

28:04.558 --> 28:06.560
to work your way in here.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.106
You're more patient than I am.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.357
I don't know
what you're talking...

28:11.357 --> 28:13.317
Don't lie to me, boy.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.574
I remember you.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.868
From Tar Valon.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.996
You watched
those women parade me

28:25.996 --> 28:28.791
<i>through the streets
like an animal.</i>

28:28.791 --> 28:31.210
- You must be confused.
- Nah, nah.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.379
<i>I can see it.</i>

28:33.379 --> 28:36.632
<i>When another man can channel,
there's a glow, and yours...</i>

28:37.675 --> 28:40.261
...yours was brighter than any
I've ever seen.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.680
I'll never forget
looking up and seeing you

28:42.680 --> 28:44.682
<i>sitting on that wall.</i>

28:45.683 --> 28:48.060
<i>I knew you'd shake the world.</i>

28:48.060 --> 28:51.856
<i>Caged as I was,
I couldn't help laughing.</i>

28:53.524 --> 28:56.610
And here you are now,
all these months later,

28:56.610 --> 28:59.071
all these miles away.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.533
So ask me...

29:06.871 --> 29:09.707
...what you came here for.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.315
I want to know...

29:35.816 --> 29:37.776
...how to control it.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.785
What's so funny?

29:49.497 --> 29:51.707
A Ghealdanin red.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.003
Then I'll show you
what you want to know.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.087
Are you serious?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.798
I could use a taste of home.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.301
We're thousands of miles
away from Ghealdan.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.887
Where am I supposed to find
a bottle of wine like that?

30:04.887 --> 30:06.972
You worked out
how to get yourself here,

30:06.972 --> 30:09.517
I'm sure you can
work this out, too.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.479
...wave on wave,

30:13.479 --> 30:16.941
cheers roll from watchers
in their thousands,

30:16.941 --> 30:19.109
roll across the rooftops

30:19.109 --> 30:22.363
and towers of Illian,
crash and break

30:22.363 --> 30:24.156
unheard...

30:24.156 --> 30:25.991
...around
the thousand ears of riders

30:25.991 --> 30:29.912
whose hearts and eyes shine
with their sacred quest.

30:29.912 --> 30:33.457
The Great Hunt
of the Horn rides forth,

30:33.457 --> 30:36.752
rides to seek the Horn of Valere

30:36.752 --> 30:38.921
that will summon
the heroes of the Ages

30:38.921 --> 30:43.300
back from the grave
to battle for the Light...

30:45.177 --> 30:47.137
Four centuries
since the last Hunt...

30:47.137 --> 30:48.889
What is going on?

30:48.889 --> 30:52.268
Tomorrow those unlucky bastards
go off to hunt for the Horn.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.061
Horn? What horn?

30:54.061 --> 30:56.105
The Horn of Valere.

30:56.105 --> 30:59.650
You really were a shepherd,
weren't you?

30:59.650 --> 31:00.985
Every few hundred years,

31:00.985 --> 31:03.404
they call the Hunt
for the Horn in Illian.

31:03.404 --> 31:06.448
Legend says whoever finds it
can summon an army of the dead.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.410
The queen has promised half
her fortune to the woman or man

31:09.410 --> 31:11.620
who brings back the Horn
to Cairhien.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.331
Assuming they don't drink
themselves to death before.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.254
- Looking for something special?
- Yes.

31:20.254 --> 31:23.382
A Ghealdanin red?

31:23.382 --> 31:25.593
Good luck finding a bottle
like that in the Foregate.

31:25.593 --> 31:28.304
Where would I find such a wine?

31:29.346 --> 31:30.723
You gonna tell me
why you're so keen

31:30.723 --> 31:32.433
on this bottle all of a sudden?

31:32.433 --> 31:36.312
I have a feeling you prefer it
when there's a little mystery.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.608
I'll be back.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.401
First glass is free
for the hunters,

31:42.401 --> 31:43.652
but charge them double
once they start buying

31:43.652 --> 31:44.862
rounds for their mates.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.071
Come on, then.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.907
Where are we going?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.534
To find you a better coat.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.708
Come on, we're going to be late.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.919
Can't you weave us
together a hangover cure?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.714
I thought you were
an innkeeper's daughter.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.841
Should be no stranger
to hard liquor.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.637
Ny, it's me.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.265
Nynaeve?

32:18.187 --> 32:19.980
Egwene.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.609
Oh, this isn't how I intended
for you to find out.

32:23.609 --> 32:24.902
I'm sorry.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.403
What's going on?

32:26.403 --> 32:28.822
Where's... where's Nynaeve?

32:28.822 --> 32:32.076
She was called to be
an Accepted this morning.

32:32.076 --> 32:35.371
She went into the Arches,
but she never came out.

32:37.498 --> 32:39.667
No, I-I just saw her. She...

32:42.211 --> 32:44.797
We need to go in there
and get her out!

32:44.797 --> 32:45.923
The Arches don't work like that.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.093
We have
to do something.

32:51.512 --> 32:52.971
It can't be.

32:54.765 --> 32:58.060
I will speak bluntly,
not out of cruelty,

32:58.060 --> 33:00.020
but out of respect for you.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.898
Nynaeve is dead.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.775
She's not coming back.

33:06.193 --> 33:09.113
The loss is going to shake you
perhaps most of all,

33:09.113 --> 33:11.782
but your grief is your own.

33:11.782 --> 33:15.619
Face it, and in time,
you will grow stronger.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.455
Like roots of a tree
when met with rock,

33:18.455 --> 33:22.167
an Aes Sedai must find a way
to stand on her own.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.760
Take the time you need.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.347
But know the pain will pass.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.564
Egwene, I'm so sorry.

33:43.564 --> 33:46.233
I didn't know Nynaeve,
but I know you loved her.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.446
I know she would have
faced her fate bravely.

33:53.157 --> 33:54.158
Get out.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.244
- Get out.
- Egwene...

33:57.244 --> 33:59.329
- Please.
- Egwene,
whatever you're feeling...

33:59.329 --> 34:00.330
Get out!

34:00.330 --> 34:01.582
I don't even know you!

34:01.582 --> 34:03.208
I don't want you here.
Just get out!

34:08.589 --> 34:10.007
Nynaeve...

34:41.872 --> 34:44.124
Oh...

34:46.001 --> 34:48.921
You're watching me sleep now,
are you?

34:48.921 --> 34:52.299
Is that a "I'm here
to murder you" stare,

34:52.299 --> 34:55.552
or "Light, I've never realized
how handsome you are"?

34:55.552 --> 34:57.638
We lost a sister this morning.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.350
A woman of incredible power.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.395
Someone I respected.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.607
On the plus side,
I'm sure she was probably

35:08.607 --> 35:11.193
really, really old.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.111
The door is open.
You're free to go.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.534
What are you playing at?

35:18.534 --> 35:20.494
All you've been saying
since I brought you here

35:20.494 --> 35:22.871
is that Moiraine
left you behind,

35:22.871 --> 35:25.040
you never would've
abandoned your friends.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.961
Well, Egwene is
right here in this Tower.

35:28.961 --> 35:32.172
And if it's one thing
she needs more than ever...

35:32.172 --> 35:33.382
it's a friend.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.092
But how do I know
you don't have sisters

35:35.092 --> 35:36.969
right outside this room
waiting for me?

35:36.969 --> 35:39.930
Leave. Stay.
Makes no difference to me.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.558
We're done here.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.437
So, after five months
of these questions and games

35:47.437 --> 35:48.647
you're done with me?

35:48.647 --> 35:49.940
That is bollocks.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.486
A sister died today
because she was ill prepared

35:54.486 --> 35:56.905
for the greatest challenge
a woman can face in this Tower.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.657
She needed my help.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.578
But for the past five months
I've been here,

36:02.578 --> 36:05.664
wasting my time
with Moiraine's little secret.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.916
Moiraine might have seen
something in you--

36:07.916 --> 36:11.211
Light, Darkness, importance--

36:12.546 --> 36:14.339
but I see nothing.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.302
You're not dangerous.

36:18.302 --> 36:21.847
You're an insidious coward who
mistakes his own moral failings

36:21.847 --> 36:23.932
for cunning and wit.

36:25.225 --> 36:29.313
A stupid, desperate boy
who wallows in self-pity,

36:29.313 --> 36:32.024
blaming his friends
for leaving him.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.238
I know you, Mat Cauthon,

36:38.238 --> 36:40.532
though you may not
know yourself.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.494
You left them.

36:45.579 --> 36:47.581
And you'd do it again.

36:49.958 --> 36:54.129
So go, find Egwene,
if she'll see you.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.589
Or run home,

36:55.589 --> 36:57.591
or starve in the Blight.

36:57.591 --> 37:01.053
It doesn't matter to me,
because you don't matter.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.725
Just spare me
the misery of your company.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.186
It's already cost
too many people their lives.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.741
...Nynaeve al'Meara.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.180
Come to pay your respects?

37:46.682 --> 37:48.392
You did this.

37:50.394 --> 37:53.021
Ever since we got to the Tower,
you've had your eye on Nynaeve.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.483
You wanted her dead.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.698
I'll leave you to your grief.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.952
Don't walk away from me.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.870
I'm not done with you!

38:16.003 --> 38:17.879
Your friend had a gift.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.589
Raw power.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.635
But you were supposed to be
the smart one.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.179
The girl who knew her place.

38:28.432 --> 38:32.936
The girl who knew how dangerous
it is to overstep.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.109
We Aes Sedai can only
speak the truth,

38:39.109 --> 38:41.403
so hear my words
and know they are true.

38:41.403 --> 38:43.780
I didn't send Nynaeve
to her death.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.242
I sent her to the Arches
because I believed in her.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.039
But she disappointed me.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.127
It's not always
the most powerful women

38:57.127 --> 38:58.628
who write history.

39:00.297 --> 39:02.090
It's the ones who survive.

39:03.967 --> 39:06.762
You remember your place,
and you just might.

39:11.558 --> 39:14.436
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

39:43.924 --> 39:45.675
I could get used
to you looking like this.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.969
People are staring.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.055
They know we weren't
at that dinner.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.225
Of course, but it only
makes them more curious.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.810
Look at this.

39:56.103 --> 39:59.064
Lady Dhulaine has invited us
to dine with her next week.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.024
They're trying to figure out

40:01.024 --> 40:04.069
if we're outland nobles
they can use against each other.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.405
And the Ghealdanin red?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.490
Oh.

40:21.878 --> 40:26.383
Be careful of an invitation
from Lady Dhulaine.

40:26.383 --> 40:29.719
However you reply,
there will be costs attached.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.680
Hmm.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.015
So, what will it be?

40:34.015 --> 40:36.685
Yes or no?

40:44.651 --> 40:46.027
Neither.

40:46.027 --> 40:50.073
Well, now you'll really
have the Houses talking.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.290
Outland lord or no,

40:58.290 --> 40:59.708
something gives me
the impression

40:59.708 --> 41:02.127
you're staying in the Foregate,

41:02.127 --> 41:03.962
aren't you?

41:05.297 --> 41:07.424
It must seem so barbaric,

41:07.424 --> 41:11.219
celebrating like this while
those poor people starve.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.804
Their only hope some ridiculous

41:12.804 --> 41:14.973
"Hunt for the Horn."

41:14.973 --> 41:16.892
The queen's reward
sounds worth the risk.

41:16.892 --> 41:20.020
Please, boy.
There is no reward.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.731
There might not even be
a horn, for all I know.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.232
The queen doesn't care.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.401
She wants her city back.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.571
After the Aiel War,

41:29.571 --> 41:32.949
the farmers and peasants
who survived in the countryside

41:32.949 --> 41:34.743
came to the city for safety.

41:34.743 --> 41:39.206
And now?
The Foregate's overrun.

41:39.206 --> 41:43.293
But you can't just kick people
out of their homes.

41:43.293 --> 41:45.128
They'd revolt.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.339
You have to give them
a reason to leave.

41:48.465 --> 41:52.052
Most will die of exposure
or disappear in the Blight.

41:53.386 --> 41:57.682
But they don't care, so long
as they save a little silver.

41:58.850 --> 42:02.520
One less poor mouth
for the rich to feed.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.689
It's an elegant solution, really.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.609
Sorry to cut in, Lady...

42:07.609 --> 42:09.945
Anvaere.

42:09.945 --> 42:12.364
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.325
No, I don't believe we have.

42:20.247 --> 42:22.874
Look what I found.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.296
Now are you going
to tell me who it's for?

42:31.174 --> 42:32.509
What's wrong?

42:32.509 --> 42:34.803
The Hunt for the Horn
is not real.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.348
There is no reward.

42:38.348 --> 42:41.559
It's all a ploy
to purge the Foregate.

42:45.397 --> 42:46.940
Of course it's not real.

42:46.940 --> 42:49.985
This is the most political
city in the world.

42:49.985 --> 42:52.195
Everything anyone
says or does is part of

42:52.195 --> 42:53.738
some scheme or some game.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.907
Even Lady Anvaere.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.244
Don't you wonder why
she wanted to talk to you?

43:00.287 --> 43:01.496
What about you?

43:03.039 --> 43:05.292
What is your reason
for helping me?

43:07.085 --> 43:09.838
Don't ask questions
you know the answer to.

43:09.838 --> 43:12.549
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
asked for your help.

43:12.549 --> 43:13.800
I have to go.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.719
Wait. We're having fun.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.804
- Sorry.
- You're just going
to leave me here?

43:19.389 --> 43:21.433
You're going to miss
the fireworks.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.411
Back so soon?

43:43.204 --> 43:44.956
You must be desperate.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.418
Ah...

43:53.465 --> 43:55.550
You've been suppressing it
a long time.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.260
I have.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.388
But it won't go away.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.561
The itch.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.772
The urge to touch it.

44:08.772 --> 44:10.648
How do I stop it?

44:13.318 --> 44:14.527
You can't.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.282
That's the secret.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.744
The answer to the question
you already knew.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.581
It can't be contained.

44:26.581 --> 44:30.585
Eventually,
it will spill out of you.

44:34.297 --> 44:35.423
Always.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.555
You are mad.

44:44.432 --> 44:46.976
There's no madness, boy.

44:46.976 --> 44:50.313
The Aes Sedai use that lie
to justify their cruelty.

44:50.313 --> 44:53.066
They poison the world
against men

44:53.066 --> 44:54.984
so they can castrate us.

44:54.984 --> 44:56.236
But they know

44:56.236 --> 45:00.115
that only the Dragon can
defeat the Dark One!

45:02.492 --> 45:04.744
You're not the Dragon.

45:18.258 --> 45:19.467
No?

45:22.554 --> 45:26.891
The blood of Lews Therin Telamon
flows in my veins.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.477
I can feel him...

45:30.812 --> 45:32.939
...hear his whispers.

45:32.939 --> 45:35.024
This was a mistake.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.027
You're going
to get me out of here.

45:38.027 --> 45:40.238
I know you are.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.323
I'm the only one
who can teach you.

45:45.994 --> 45:47.787
You can't help me.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.709
You're sick.

45:56.546 --> 45:57.714
Maybe.

45:57.714 --> 46:00.300
But none of us can hide
from what we are.

47:02.237 --> 47:04.531
Hey. Come over here.

47:08.409 --> 47:10.328
Look, if you're trying
to seduce me,

47:10.328 --> 47:13.581
- the answer is still not...
- I'm not trying to seduce you.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.377
You all right?

47:17.377 --> 47:18.920
You seem unusually
maudlin tonight.

47:18.920 --> 47:21.798
Yeah. Yeah.
Just come over here.

47:21.798 --> 47:23.091
Okay.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.016
Mat...

47:32.016 --> 47:34.519
- Yeah?
- The door's open.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.021
Yeah.

47:37.021 --> 47:38.565
So let's go.

47:41.943 --> 47:44.737
- Where?
- Who cares?

47:46.030 --> 47:47.448
I don't know where to go.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.368
I've been in here
for all these months

47:50.368 --> 47:53.788
and now I can leave and...

47:53.788 --> 47:55.373
I don't know where to go.

47:57.250 --> 48:00.378
All that matters right now
is that that door's open,

48:00.378 --> 48:01.879
and it's time
to walk through it.

48:04.591 --> 48:06.593
'Cause I'm definitely
not waiting for you.

48:35.705 --> 48:38.124
I was starting to worry
you might never wake up.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.336
Who are you?

48:41.336 --> 48:43.588
Oh, I'm the man standing
between you and the spike.

48:45.632 --> 48:48.635
You, my friend, are part of
a caravan headed to Falme.

48:48.635 --> 48:51.679
As an honored guest
of Lady Suroth,

48:51.679 --> 48:53.473
you will be provided accommodations

48:53.473 --> 48:56.017
and a new life
with the Seanchan.

48:56.017 --> 48:57.644
But between us...

48:58.853 --> 49:00.438
...that's not
a coveted invitation.

49:01.731 --> 49:03.900
Nothing good awaits you
in the harbor city.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.696
You must be thirsty.

49:15.328 --> 49:17.747
It's all right.

49:17.747 --> 49:19.374
It's just water.

49:32.637 --> 49:35.807
There's something different
about you, isn't there, Perrin?

49:35.807 --> 49:39.519
I should have expected it
when I saw those eyes.

49:39.519 --> 49:40.937
What are you talking about?

49:40.937 --> 49:43.981
You know you have
something inside you.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.651
Something that calls for blood.

49:46.651 --> 49:49.654
Something that sets
your eyes on fire.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.782
Show me, Perrin.

49:52.782 --> 49:55.618
I want to meet the monster.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.538
Who are you?

49:58.538 --> 50:00.707
You know who I am.

50:04.252 --> 50:06.838
You're dead.

50:07.547 --> 50:09.590
Rand killed you.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.009
Is that what Moiraine told you?

50:17.181 --> 50:18.933
They're here.

50:18.933 --> 50:20.768
Wolf!

50:41.164 --> 50:43.458
What do you want from me?

50:52.717 --> 50:54.469
The more wolf you are,

50:54.469 --> 50:56.721
the more you're mine.

50:58.806 --> 51:02.560
I'll be watching your progress
with great interest.

51:26.042 --> 51:27.460
Let's go!

51:35.384 --> 51:36.385
Let's go.

51:47.688 --> 51:49.816
Run. He'll show you where.

51:49.816 --> 51:52.109
What about Loial and the others?

51:52.109 --> 51:54.028
You can't help your friends
from the back of a cage.

51:55.404 --> 51:56.823
Run!

51:56.823 --> 51:58.449
Right there. Get him!

52:05.373 --> 52:06.958
Did you steal those nags?

52:06.958 --> 52:09.252
Uh, I prefer
the term "liberated."

52:09.252 --> 52:11.879
Did you work a few hard days
to get that food?

52:11.879 --> 52:13.130
What can I say?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.132
Freedom is in the air tonight.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.093
Hold her.

52:17.093 --> 52:19.220
I need to grab one more thing.

52:40.575 --> 52:41.742
Well?

52:41.742 --> 52:44.287
He's coming with me.

52:44.287 --> 52:46.163
It was mostly even his idea.

52:46.163 --> 52:48.124
Well, he's nothing
if not predictable.

52:48.124 --> 52:49.792
Hmm.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.920
- You know the way?
- Mm-hmm.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.424
Remember...

52:57.800 --> 52:59.427
...if you succeed,

52:59.427 --> 53:03.598
Moiraine won't have anything
over either of us ever again.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.230
Don't let me down.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.336
If you ever leave me like that
again, I will kill you.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.471
No.

53:44.513 --> 53:47.391
Leave it on... My Lord.

53:53.773 --> 53:55.983
That's it.

53:55.983 --> 53:57.693
Show me...

53:57.693 --> 53:59.195
Show me.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.040
Let go.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.501
I'm not afraid of you.

54:44.365 --> 54:46.951
Rand. Rand!

55:09.515 --> 55:11.642
You all right?

55:56.520 --> 55:58.022
You're not the first to try.

55:58.022 --> 56:01.609
In 3,000 years, there've been
over a hundred attempts

56:01.609 --> 56:03.652
to bring back
a lost friend or lover.

56:05.738 --> 56:07.156
It never works.

56:09.742 --> 56:12.286
And it takes more than one
Aes Sedai to open the Arches.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.080
So help me or leave.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.831
No.

56:18.334 --> 56:20.544
You are going to hurt yourself.

56:20.544 --> 56:23.089
You might even die.

56:23.089 --> 56:25.424
The best outcome here is one of
the sisters will catch you

56:25.424 --> 56:26.842
and you will be expelled.

56:26.842 --> 56:29.553
- You think I care
about that now?
- Yes.

56:29.553 --> 56:31.180
Of course you do.

56:34.016 --> 56:36.519
I heard what happened
at the Two Rivers.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.063
The Trolloc attack.

56:40.773 --> 56:44.193
The death of so many people,
including the young Wisdom.

56:46.278 --> 56:49.115
But she didn't die, did she?

56:49.115 --> 56:53.410
She survived, found you,
and traveled with you here.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.496
It's pretty clear
the Great Serpent ring

56:55.496 --> 56:57.498
would never sit easily
on her finger.

56:58.999 --> 57:00.626
But she still came.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.254
For you.

57:05.256 --> 57:06.715
Do you really think

57:06.715 --> 57:09.468
Nynaeve would want you
to throw away your life,

57:09.468 --> 57:11.679
your future, because she's gone?

57:14.390 --> 57:17.143
She's the strongest person
I've ever known.

57:17.143 --> 57:19.854
How could
she have failed?

57:21.856 --> 57:24.233
No one knows what happens
in the Arches.

57:27.361 --> 57:29.029
I can't leave her.

57:29.029 --> 57:31.323
I'll get us some blankets.

57:32.741 --> 57:34.160
We can stay the night.

57:35.578 --> 57:38.873
Maybe what she faced offered her
a better turn of the Wheel.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.731
Mummy, look!

58:03.731 --> 58:05.566
Did Perrin make that for you?

58:06.734 --> 58:08.694
She wanted something
to fight off the monsters.

58:08.694 --> 58:11.155
She's a brave girl.
Like her mum.

58:11.155 --> 58:13.157
Papa can teach me how to use it.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.034
Uh, we'll see.

58:19.955 --> 58:21.707
It's Mat.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.554
My Lady.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.890
Forgive me.

58:37.890 --> 58:39.683
I did not realize that

58:39.683 --> 58:42.311
we had a blademaster
in the Two Rivers.

58:42.311 --> 58:44.230
It's me.

58:44.230 --> 58:45.397
Elnore!

58:47.358 --> 58:49.526
When did you get so grown-up?

58:52.696 --> 58:54.698
Welcome home, stranger.

59:02.915 --> 59:04.250
How about we see

59:04.250 --> 59:06.126
if your father needs any help
with the honey cakes?

59:06.126 --> 59:08.128
Yeah? Come on.
Off you go.

59:08.128 --> 59:09.421
Honey cakes?

59:09.421 --> 59:11.257
All right.
Come on then.

59:16.011 --> 59:18.055
No, no, no, no, no.

59:27.982 --> 59:29.775
I got a letter
from Egwene today.

59:31.402 --> 59:33.320
She and the other Greens
are headed north.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.489
Trollocs have invaded Saldaea.

59:37.825 --> 59:39.618
Well, Saldaea's a far way off.

59:39.618 --> 59:41.704
Not far enough.

59:44.999 --> 59:46.792
Egwene Sedai can handle
a few Trollocs.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.515
Do you regret leaving the Tower?

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:09.940
Can I have another honey cake?

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.192
You have had plenty.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:15.237
How about you go give Mat
and Perrin a hug good night

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.655
and we get ready for bed?
Yeah?

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.075
Mummy?

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.660
The cellar.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.787
- Now. Go.
- Yeah.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.340
I need you to be a brave girl.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.716
Just stay here
and wait for me to come back.

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:37.551
Can you do that for me?

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:52.209
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.293
No.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.755
No, no. No.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.981
Mummy?

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.199
What's that?

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:32.624
The way back will come but once.

01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:39.339
Come on, sweetheart,
we have to go.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.133
But I'm scared.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.051
I know.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.304
But I need you to trust me.
Do you trust Mummy?

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:47.222
Okay.
Close your eyes.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:48.474
I'm here.

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:51.351
Everything's gonna be
all right.

01:03:27.763 --> 01:03:30.182
You're all right. I'm here.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.519
Everything is going
to be all right.
