01:34.672 --> 01:35.672
Good day.

01:36.048 --> 01:39.175
On this day, July 1st 2014...

01:39.385 --> 01:41.511
at this hour, 0600...

01:41.679 --> 01:44.264
we are at the very first airport in the world...

01:44.432 --> 01:47.767
...topic of so much controversy
over the past 7 years...

01:47.894 --> 01:49.978
has continued development.

01:50.146 --> 01:54.941
Protests from environmental groups and a number of
developing countries continue.

01:56.861 --> 02:01.114
...It had been claimed the CW7 is the answer
to global warming.

02:01.407 --> 02:02.949
And we are witnesses.

02:03.117 --> 02:07.037
...Leaders who argue that global warming
can no longer be ignored.

02:07.413 --> 02:11.541
Today, 79 countries will began dispersing CW7...

02:11.709 --> 02:14.461
in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

02:16.589 --> 02:21.009
...And surprisingly bring down the
average global temperatures...

02:21.427 --> 02:23.720
It is just a day away that...

02:25.222 --> 02:26.681
...According to scientists...

02:26.849 --> 02:29.851
the artificial cooling substance CW7...

02:29.977 --> 02:34.439
will succeed in bringing average global temperatures
down to manageable levels.

02:34.607 --> 02:38.568
As a revolutionary solution to mankind's
warming of the planet.

04:01.527 --> 04:02.569
Head check.

04:09.201 --> 04:10.660
Alright, get in line.

04:11.412 --> 04:12.576
Everybody sit down.

04:12.696 --> 04:16.552
One, two, three...

04:16.672 --> 04:20.009
four, five, six...

04:20.129 --> 04:21.087
Keep going.

04:22.089 --> 04:23.131
Go on.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.333
Hey you, sit down.

04:31.766 --> 04:33.433
Curtis, sit down.

04:35.686 --> 04:37.082
Sit down.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.060
I said sit down!

04:43.110 --> 04:45.576
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

04:45.696 --> 04:48.871
Can't you sit and count?
You want to get shot? You're crazy.

04:48.991 --> 04:50.700
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.038
Are there any experienced violinists here?

04:55.206 --> 04:56.498
Raise your hands.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.333
Violinist!

04:58.501 --> 05:00.335
Stand up, come forward.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.003
Food, come and get it.

05:02.671 --> 05:04.756
Violinist, they're having a laugh.

05:04.924 --> 05:07.654
Those bastards in the front sections
think they own us.

05:07.774 --> 05:11.390
Eating their steak dinner
and listening to string quartets.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.661
Will be different when we get there.

05:15.122 --> 05:16.768
I want steak.

05:21.692 --> 05:23.261
Excuse me, sir.

05:23.570 --> 05:27.570
My wife and I played violin in the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.114
I was first chair.

05:29.532 --> 05:30.824
Can you still play?

05:30.991 --> 05:32.492
Well of course, you never forget.

05:32.612 --> 05:34.119
Show me your hands.

05:37.414 --> 05:39.082
You, follow me.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.584
Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

05:41.919 --> 05:43.112
Not both?

05:43.796 --> 05:45.213
Yes, both hands.

05:46.173 --> 05:49.134
My wife Doris plays beautifully.
Better than me, even.

05:49.301 --> 05:51.136
They just need one person.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.513
Then I won't go.

05:55.391 --> 05:56.766
Doris, Doris...

06:00.919 --> 06:02.706
Sit down, everyone.

06:02.826 --> 06:04.190
Sit down.

06:04.358 --> 06:06.162
- They can't just...
- Sit down.

06:07.319 --> 06:08.695
Those fucking bastards.

06:08.815 --> 06:10.196
Now isn't the time.

06:10.316 --> 06:11.698
Well, when is the time?

06:12.286 --> 06:13.324
Soon.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.621
Doris.

06:15.741 --> 06:17.954
I'll be back, Doris.
It's alright.

06:20.499 --> 06:21.583
I'll come back.

06:38.309 --> 06:40.143
What does steak taste like again?

06:40.603 --> 06:42.270
I had it once,
but I can't remember.

06:42.438 --> 06:44.434
If you can't remember then it's better
to forget.

06:44.554 --> 06:47.609
What does it smell like when it's cooked?

06:47.776 --> 06:49.611
It must emanate around the place.

06:49.945 --> 06:50.862
Curtis. Is this it?

06:51.238 --> 06:52.660
It's not it.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.151
Sorry.

06:54.271 --> 06:56.451
Curtis, here!

07:00.706 --> 07:02.206
Timbo!

07:03.125 --> 07:04.334
How's it hanging, buddy?

07:04.973 --> 07:06.213
Give me a pow.

07:09.089 --> 07:10.215
Hey listen.

07:10.674 --> 07:12.640
I think I need that protein block.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.319
How about I trade you,
this one for that one?

07:18.474 --> 07:19.474
No.

07:19.808 --> 07:22.942
Nice bargaining power, Curtis.
Here, give me this one, I'll give you that...

07:23.062 --> 07:24.187
Relax, relax...

07:24.355 --> 07:25.730
Come here, Timmy.

07:26.982 --> 07:28.441
Come right...

07:30.569 --> 07:32.111
I have an idea.

07:32.529 --> 07:36.898
I'll give you this one and that one
for that one.

07:37.865 --> 07:39.597
- What do you say?
- No.

07:40.473 --> 07:41.663
Go get him.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.313
Timmy!

07:47.211 --> 07:50.922
Timothy, your mom is gonna give you
a darn good spanking.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.382
Where the fuck he went?

07:52.502 --> 07:55.933
Hey, come here.
Give it to me.

07:56.053 --> 07:57.871
Hi Jose, how are you doing?

07:59.512 --> 08:02.157
Timmy! Work with me here.

08:02.277 --> 08:03.768
Edgar, why did you let him
get up there?

08:03.936 --> 08:06.104
No I didn't, he got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.595
- He's 5.
- He's a very nimble 5 year old.

08:08.715 --> 08:11.185
Timmy, sweetie, come down.

08:14.238 --> 08:15.196
Come here.

08:15.781 --> 08:17.282
What do you want for it?

08:17.491 --> 08:19.331
In the whole wide train?

08:19.451 --> 08:21.215
In the whole wide train.

08:21.578 --> 08:22.495
The ball.

08:22.871 --> 08:24.517
The ball? No.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.008
No, I'm sorry I can't do that.
I can't do that.

08:27.128 --> 08:30.837
Yes, I get the ball for a whole hour.

08:36.927 --> 08:38.082
Done.

08:39.779 --> 08:42.332
Curtis. Is it time?

08:42.725 --> 08:45.593
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.291
Red paper?

09:09.016 --> 09:11.836
Yeah, it's the one we've been
waiting for.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.380
Our informant gave us a name.

09:16.811 --> 09:19.692
N, A, M...

09:20.276 --> 09:22.638
Nam Koong Min Soo.

09:23.557 --> 09:26.238
He's a security expert.
He's in the prison section now.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.735
- Wait, you're joking right? He's in prison?
- Out of here.

09:29.855 --> 09:31.957
- I'm just saying, what kind of chance do we have...
- Edgar.

09:32.077 --> 09:36.002
I just think if this guy says
that he's such a great security expert...

09:36.122 --> 09:39.358
- why can't he just break out himself?
- That's enough! Go.

09:43.327 --> 09:44.494
Let's go, Tim.

09:44.745 --> 09:45.995
Come on, let's go.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.480
Edgar just wants to help, you know.

09:53.253 --> 09:55.004
He thinks the world of you.

09:56.340 --> 09:59.926
He shouldn't worship me the way he does.
I'm not who he thinks I am.

10:01.845 --> 10:03.747
Few of us ever are.

10:04.390 --> 10:06.015
Alright, we're here.

10:06.850 --> 10:09.692
Tail section, quarantine section,
prison section.

10:09.812 --> 10:13.042
Gate, gate, gate.

10:13.162 --> 10:16.109
4 seconds when all three gates
are open at once.

10:16.402 --> 10:20.703
We have 4 seconds to go through three gates
and bust Nam out.

10:20.823 --> 10:23.991
Then Nam gets us the rest of the way.

10:25.869 --> 10:28.558
Our fate depends on this man.

10:29.665 --> 10:31.001
Yeah.

10:33.335 --> 10:36.879
If we can get him to cooperate
he can take us all the way to the front of the train.

10:39.383 --> 10:41.092
Very front section?

10:42.219 --> 10:43.344
Yeah.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.683
From here right to
the front of the train.

10:48.851 --> 10:50.518
Everything in one stroke.

10:52.563 --> 10:55.022
We control the engine,
we control the world.

10:55.232 --> 10:57.024
Without that,
we have nothing.

10:57.818 --> 11:00.784
All past revolutions have failed
because they couldn't take the engine.

11:00.904 --> 11:02.488
What are you saying?

11:04.283 --> 11:06.109
This time we take the engine.

11:07.244 --> 11:08.721
Then what?

11:11.415 --> 11:12.779
We kill them.

11:12.899 --> 11:14.208
Wilford?

11:20.220 --> 11:22.580
You should run the train now,
not Wilford.

11:23.844 --> 11:27.221
I am a shadow of my former shadow.

11:29.641 --> 11:32.018
My day was decades ago.

11:33.723 --> 11:35.396
How old is Gilliam?

11:36.149 --> 11:37.690
Shut up, Edgar.

11:38.233 --> 11:42.236
I'm not saying that I want that to happen,
that's not what I'm saying.

11:44.198 --> 11:46.699
What I mean is
he will die someday.

11:49.203 --> 11:51.871
And when that happens,
you're gonna have to take over.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.291
You're gonna have to
run the train.

11:56.835 --> 11:58.461
I'm not a leader.

12:01.256 --> 12:02.381
I don't know.

12:03.967 --> 12:06.177
I think you'd be pretty good
if you ask me.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.689
Hey, Edgar.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.069
How far back
can you remember?

12:24.404 --> 12:25.988
I don't know, like what?

12:26.365 --> 12:28.991
Your mother, you remember her?

12:33.997 --> 12:35.831
I can remember a face...

12:37.292 --> 12:38.960
every once in a while.

12:41.588 --> 12:43.089
But it's not clear.

12:46.385 --> 12:47.933
Stay down, everybody.

12:48.053 --> 12:50.651
- Everybody stay in your place.
- Fucking look at me.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.596
Keep down, keep down.

12:57.153 --> 13:00.314
- Medical inspection. Just the kids.
- All the kids come with me.

13:00.524 --> 13:01.992
It's a medical check up.

13:02.266 --> 13:03.526
You're doing good.

13:03.646 --> 13:06.070
Everybody, all the kids.

13:06.190 --> 13:08.698
- All the kids?
- You too.
- That's right, just come.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.973
Stay back there, ma'am.
Just stay back there.

13:12.828 --> 13:14.912
Alright, one more.

13:15.032 --> 13:17.713
Yup, come on.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.917
You need to go.

13:20.085 --> 13:23.653
It's just a medical check up.
You just stay back there.

13:23.773 --> 13:26.789
Come on, that's right.
Come with the others, okay.

14:20.809 --> 14:22.395
You, go and check.

14:22.515 --> 14:25.300
- Don't move.
- Go, Timmy!

14:34.876 --> 14:36.426
Timmy!

14:43.117 --> 14:44.594
That's her baby!

14:47.631 --> 14:49.189
Andy!

14:49.875 --> 14:51.634
Give me back my son.

14:52.593 --> 14:55.365
Give me my son,
you fucking bitch!

14:55.485 --> 14:57.074
Andy!

15:00.529 --> 15:02.645
Let him throw his shoe.

15:10.792 --> 15:14.093
- Timmy!
- Tim!

15:39.599 --> 15:43.292
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

16:27.397 --> 16:30.308
7 minutes allotted for your speech, sir.

16:33.737 --> 16:36.489
This is so disappointing.

16:41.369 --> 16:44.789
No no, we don't need all that,
we only got 7 minutes.

16:53.298 --> 16:54.548
Passengers...

16:55.550 --> 16:58.455
This is not a shoe.

16:58.929 --> 17:01.725
This is disorder.

17:02.053 --> 17:05.476
This is size 10 chaos.

17:05.935 --> 17:09.707
This, you see this?
This is death.

17:10.397 --> 17:14.151
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing...

17:14.319 --> 17:17.445
that's between our warm hearts
and the bitter cold...

17:17.833 --> 17:21.567
Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

17:21.992 --> 17:26.140
Order is the barrier that holds back
the cold and death.

17:26.705 --> 17:29.458
We must all of us,
on this train of life...

17:29.626 --> 17:32.211
remain in our allotted stations...

17:32.587 --> 17:35.005
we must each of us occupy...

17:35.215 --> 17:39.176
our preordained particulate positions.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.893
Would you wear a shoe on your head?

17:48.270 --> 17:50.062
Of course you wouldn't wear
a shoe on your head.

17:50.272 --> 17:51.897
A shoe doesn't belong in your head.

17:52.065 --> 17:54.894
A shoe belongs on your foot.

17:55.193 --> 17:57.617
A hat belongs on your head.

17:57.737 --> 18:00.281
I am a hat,
you are a shoe.

18:00.448 --> 18:03.367
I belong on the head,
you belong on the foot.

18:03.535 --> 18:05.929
Yes? So it is.

18:06.538 --> 18:09.874
In the beginning, order was prescribed
by your ticket.

18:09.994 --> 18:13.711
First bus, economy,
and freeloaders like you.

18:13.831 --> 18:18.549
Eternal order is prescribed by
the Sacred Engine.

18:18.758 --> 18:21.468
All things flow from
the Sacred Engine.

18:21.636 --> 18:23.387
All things in their place.

18:23.555 --> 18:25.764
All passengers in their sections.

18:25.891 --> 18:28.517
All water flowing,
all heat rising...

18:28.685 --> 18:31.395
pays homage to
the Sacred Engine.

18:31.563 --> 18:34.773
In its own particulate...

18:35.025 --> 18:38.193
preordained position.

18:38.486 --> 18:39.862
So it is.

18:41.072 --> 18:43.824
Now, as in the beginning...

18:43.950 --> 18:46.719
I belong to the front.

18:47.795 --> 18:51.151
You belong to the tail.

18:52.292 --> 18:55.711
When the foot seeks the place of the head...

18:56.504 --> 18:58.380
a sacred line is crossed.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.716
Know your place.

19:01.217 --> 19:02.801
Keep your place.

19:03.803 --> 19:05.262
Be a shoe.

19:11.978 --> 19:14.772
We only have 42 seconds left.

19:14.898 --> 19:18.233
So we can go to a comment of Mr. Wilford,

19:18.443 --> 19:21.403
the divine keeper of
the Sacred Engine.

19:23.406 --> 19:25.466
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

19:26.534 --> 19:28.028
Are you there?

19:30.762 --> 19:32.351
Are you there, sir?

19:35.669 --> 19:39.212
It's breaking up.
Well then...

19:39.332 --> 19:41.875
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

19:42.425 --> 19:43.975
So it is.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.779
Well, we're just gonna watch?

20:03.947 --> 20:06.365
- Not now.
- I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

20:40.984 --> 20:42.692
Nah, alright.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.160
Stop, stop right there.
Sit down.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.115
Put that useless gun down.
Put it away.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.499
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.219
It's a pleasure!

21:02.797 --> 21:04.089
You look healthy.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.196
He's fine.

21:17.312 --> 21:21.065
Minister Mason, please deliver a message to Mr. Wilford.

21:21.232 --> 21:22.572
Certainly, what should I say?

21:22.692 --> 21:25.829
Tell him he and I need to talk.

21:25.949 --> 21:28.906
Well, you can talk to me.

21:29.365 --> 21:32.294
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here.

21:32.911 --> 21:34.373
Not here.

21:34.954 --> 21:36.463
At the front.

21:52.238 --> 21:54.896
Nice to hear it.

21:55.016 --> 21:56.850
Your son will be a hero, I promise.

21:57.143 --> 21:58.771
Or daughter, whatever it is.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.708
I got it.

22:02.690 --> 22:05.796
- Your contribution has been duly noted.
- Thanks.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.823
So sorry to interrupt you
while you're praying.

22:11.981 --> 22:13.786
So sorry.

22:14.077 --> 22:16.745
There's your Buddha back,
thanks very much.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.774
Move! Move!

22:24.587 --> 22:26.243
Stop fooling around.

22:54.159 --> 22:55.784
I've got a better batch.

22:56.161 --> 22:59.127
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.037
Want to try some?

23:02.208 --> 23:05.548
How many protein blocks for
10 rocks of uncut Kronol?

23:14.345 --> 23:15.910
They don't have bullets.

23:16.472 --> 23:18.098
Why do you say that?

23:19.058 --> 23:22.978
You remember what Mason said?
She said, "Put down that useless gun".

23:23.646 --> 23:25.149
She meant...

23:25.481 --> 23:27.858
she wouldn't give the order
to shoot me.

23:28.369 --> 23:29.463
No.

23:29.986 --> 23:32.813
No, I think the guns
are literally useless.

23:33.281 --> 23:36.658
They've used up all their bullets
4 years ago on the last revolt.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.621
Bullets are extinct.

23:41.247 --> 23:45.996
If you're wrong, we could be finished
before we even start.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.545
I think we should be patient.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.840
Wait for the next red letter.

24:07.398 --> 24:09.614
To the left.

24:09.734 --> 24:11.407
And right.

24:11.527 --> 24:14.068
Not yet, up.
Now left.

24:14.188 --> 24:17.169
Good, good.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.304
1...2...1...2...

24:20.424 --> 24:23.660
1...2...1...2...

24:31.203 --> 24:33.245
Hello? Andrew.

24:33.716 --> 24:35.076
Andrew!

24:35.760 --> 24:38.935
Wake up.
Rise and shine.

24:39.055 --> 24:42.809
When you dream to much of the sun,
you forget the trees.

24:44.394 --> 24:46.932
I believe this is your son.

24:47.268 --> 24:52.004
I'm sorry, it's not very good.

24:52.124 --> 24:55.326
It's not my best work,
it's a little dark.

24:55.446 --> 24:59.491
If you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

24:59.659 --> 25:02.244
What about my boy? You got one of Timmy?

25:02.412 --> 25:04.089
Yes, Tanya.
I do.

25:04.209 --> 25:07.291
Easy, easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

25:07.542 --> 25:10.624
Here, there you go, Timmy.

25:15.091 --> 25:16.437
Look at him.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.178
One little smile.

25:30.481 --> 25:32.024
Curtis, you gotta let me come with you.

25:32.275 --> 25:33.692
No, Tanya, I'm sorry.

25:34.027 --> 25:35.861
You will be if you don't let me come.

25:36.612 --> 25:39.614
I'm going to the front and I'm gonna make
that bitch sorry she put a hand on my boy.

25:39.782 --> 25:41.033
Make this one tighter.

25:41.868 --> 25:45.620
You know I'm stronger than all these
skinny ass soldiers anyway.

25:48.833 --> 25:49.916
Please.

25:53.379 --> 25:54.880
Shit, what's going on?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.840
Change of schedule, boys.
They're coming back.

25:57.008 --> 25:59.176
It's now or never.

25:59.302 --> 26:01.715
Don't panic.
Stick to the plan.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.727
Hide that, hide your weapons
in your clothes.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.163
- Head check.
- Yeah.

26:14.317 --> 26:15.624
Line up.

26:20.656 --> 26:22.151
Alright, sit down.

26:22.271 --> 26:27.052
1...2...3...

26:27.172 --> 26:28.885
What the fuck do we do?

26:29.870 --> 26:31.631
6...Keep going.

26:31.751 --> 26:33.835
I've had enough of this
protein block bullshit.

26:34.003 --> 26:35.337
Yeah, this is bullshit.

26:35.505 --> 26:37.887
- I'm fucking hungry.
- I want chicken.

26:38.007 --> 26:39.997
We're not gonna sit down
for this shite.

26:40.301 --> 26:44.707
We want chicken!
Chicken!

26:46.057 --> 26:48.107
Quiet! Be quiet!

26:48.727 --> 26:51.234
Calm down.
It's okay.

26:51.354 --> 26:53.438
You want him fucking dead?
Is that it?

26:53.606 --> 26:54.940
Keep quiet.

26:55.983 --> 26:58.077
Still going for it, are we?

27:00.613 --> 27:03.193
Come on, let's go!
Let's do it.

27:09.330 --> 27:10.372
The rifles.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.957
No, we can get them.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.292
We easily outnumber their bullets.

27:19.590 --> 27:20.924
This is it.

27:21.676 --> 27:22.968
Curtis, come on.

27:23.594 --> 27:25.595
We're out of time,
we gotta do it now.

27:37.908 --> 27:42.304
They've got no bullets!
They've got no bullets!

27:59.801 --> 28:02.865
Keep going, keep going!

28:10.057 --> 28:12.848
Close the gate quick.
Shut it.

29:00.483 --> 29:03.200
I'm fine, Grey. You go now.

29:28.302 --> 29:29.302
Fuck.

29:29.422 --> 29:33.819
Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronol addict.
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.850
- Hurry up, Edgar.
- Hurry up?

29:36.958 --> 29:39.147
So sorry for keeping you all waiting.

29:40.225 --> 29:42.065
Obviously I work here so...

29:45.152 --> 29:47.154
- Open it.
- Here we go.

30:03.546 --> 30:05.086
Kronol head...

30:07.508 --> 30:10.641
So this is Kronol?
I hear it's pretty big in the front section.

30:10.761 --> 30:12.971
Careful, that's how these guys
hallucinate.

30:13.139 --> 30:15.223
It's industrial waste.

30:16.267 --> 30:18.403
And it's highly flammable.

30:37.955 --> 30:41.754
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo, security specialist?

30:45.046 --> 30:48.548
Did you design all the door locks
and the security systems on the train?

30:49.550 --> 30:51.551
Look at him man, he's gone.
Look at his eyes.

30:51.671 --> 30:53.845
He's fried his brain
with that fucking shite.

30:54.013 --> 30:56.162
Are you Nam?

31:15.201 --> 31:17.077
Nam, are you listening?

31:21.957 --> 31:25.002
Yes, I'm listening, bastard.

31:26.388 --> 31:31.049
My name is not "Nem", it is "Nam".
Namgoung Minsoo, shit.

31:31.634 --> 31:35.601
Namgoung is my name, my surname is Minsoo, asshole.

31:35.721 --> 31:37.735
Unknown words.

31:37.855 --> 31:40.684
Try again with the correct vocabulary.

31:42.561 --> 31:43.645
We need your help.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.230
For what?

31:46.482 --> 31:48.149
We're going to the front.

31:48.442 --> 31:50.652
And we need you to open up the gates.

31:52.947 --> 31:54.239
If I don't want to?

31:55.574 --> 31:58.159
Uncut, straight from the barrel.

31:58.557 --> 32:02.080
Every door you open,
you get one lap of Kronol.

32:17.128 --> 32:20.192
Jesus, Marlboro Light?

32:22.435 --> 32:23.852
I can't believe it.

32:23.972 --> 32:27.313
Cigarettes have been extinct for more
than 10 years now.

32:37.283 --> 32:39.492
You want a smoke too, asshole?

32:40.536 --> 32:45.023
It's too good for shit like you.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.168
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

32:48.377 --> 32:50.253
You help us, you get your drug.

32:50.421 --> 32:52.964
If not, we put you back
where we found you.

32:53.215 --> 32:54.841
What'll be, asshole?

33:02.808 --> 33:03.725
Chan.

33:04.602 --> 33:06.811
Chan, get out of here.
Let's get out.

33:30.499 --> 33:31.866
That's enough.

33:33.589 --> 33:36.049
I'll put you back in the fucking drawer.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.292
Get up.

34:04.995 --> 34:09.147
My daughter, Yona.
To move forward, we need her.

34:10.583 --> 34:12.126
So you're coming with us?

34:13.337 --> 34:18.377
For each door, I want two blocks of Kronol.

34:21.053 --> 34:22.815
She's an addict too?

34:48.018 --> 34:49.641
Nobody there.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.089
Kronol?

35:14.273 --> 35:17.442
Look at all these beds. Where is everybody?

35:17.610 --> 35:19.444
Looks like they left in a hurry.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.926
There's food on the table.

35:28.662 --> 35:30.455
This can't be a window, can it?

35:48.432 --> 35:50.620
Still cold.

36:01.403 --> 36:02.666
Dead.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.928
All dead.

36:20.073 --> 36:23.925
Alright, let's go everyone. Stay focused.
We didn't come here for this.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.677
You heard the man, let's go.
Move.

36:25.844 --> 36:27.642
Nehm...Nam!

36:32.601 --> 36:33.559
Kronol!

36:34.144 --> 36:36.062
How did you know
there was nobody there?

36:37.730 --> 36:39.062
He's running.

36:49.535 --> 36:50.587
Paul?

36:51.996 --> 36:53.132
Paul!

36:53.664 --> 36:55.021
What is he doing?

36:55.141 --> 36:56.354
He looks so different.

36:56.474 --> 36:57.500
Just a second.

36:57.668 --> 37:01.063
It's used to be automatic,
but it's hard when it sticks.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.944
- It's not the Paul I remember.
- No.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.925
Paul? It's Curtis!

37:06.051 --> 37:08.959
They ain't coming back,
so now I gotta do it.

37:10.931 --> 37:12.315
Manually.

37:14.184 --> 37:15.810
So that's how it's made.

37:16.437 --> 37:18.008
Still hot.

37:18.128 --> 37:20.415
Look at them all.

37:20.733 --> 37:22.191
You do some nice work.

37:22.311 --> 37:25.153
That's right man, that's your food.
That's your protein block.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.262
Is this why they took you?
To make this garbage?

37:29.616 --> 37:30.731
Paul?

37:32.536 --> 37:34.328
You've been alone
this whole time?

37:35.080 --> 37:36.205
Alone.

37:37.166 --> 37:39.104
In the zone.

37:42.171 --> 37:44.092
We're going to the front.
Come with us.

37:44.212 --> 37:46.257
Alright, you're going to the front?
Yeah.

37:46.425 --> 37:49.969
But no way, my place is here alright?

37:50.095 --> 37:52.974
Here? Making this crap? Why?

38:15.197 --> 38:18.853
- You can't draw this.
- Okay.

38:23.337 --> 38:24.548
Oh man.

38:25.223 --> 38:27.215
All this time, we've been eating this shit?

38:27.466 --> 38:29.300
I eat them too, you know?

38:29.843 --> 38:31.219
Every single day.

38:34.473 --> 38:35.848
Where'd you get this?

38:36.764 --> 38:39.310
Have you been the one
writing this?

38:40.270 --> 38:41.771
I don't write them...

38:42.523 --> 38:44.607
Why do you have this?
Who gave this to you?

38:44.942 --> 38:47.700
They just leave them for me, man.

38:47.820 --> 38:51.328
I put them in the protein block,
I send them on.

38:51.448 --> 38:52.448
That's it.

38:56.328 --> 38:58.121
The water supply section?

38:58.288 --> 39:00.498
Yes, just a few cars up.

39:00.666 --> 39:04.460
It's where the water's cleansed
and recycled.

39:04.670 --> 39:07.296
It's one of the most crucial sections
in the train.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.050
If we take it,
we'll have the upperhand?

39:11.385 --> 39:13.845
We don't even have to go
to the very front.

39:14.388 --> 39:16.305
We control the water...

39:16.849 --> 39:18.933
we control the negotiation.

39:25.524 --> 39:30.148
Excuse me, sorry to bother you there,
could I get you a glass of water to speed this up?

39:33.323 --> 39:36.492
Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all fucking waiting.

39:37.703 --> 39:38.870
Is it my fault?

39:39.204 --> 39:40.121
You, you are.

39:40.289 --> 39:43.332
Although you've been fucking smelling that Kronol shite that...

39:43.500 --> 39:46.989
time is a probably a distant concept
for you, isn't it?

39:48.672 --> 39:51.424
Of course, I do it for the Kronol.

39:51.592 --> 39:54.427
Here we go again. Kronol this,
Kronol that...

39:54.595 --> 39:57.555
Christ almighty man,
do some fucking work.

39:57.848 --> 40:00.099
You're the one who's giving me this.

40:00.184 --> 40:03.819
Are you thick? That's what you asked for
each time you opened the gate.

40:10.903 --> 40:13.206
Yona? It's Yona right?

40:15.407 --> 40:16.798
How old are you?

40:19.369 --> 40:20.661
17.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.706
17, you're a train baby then?

40:26.008 --> 40:27.423
How about you?

40:29.087 --> 40:30.922
17 years on earth.

40:31.979 --> 40:34.050
17 years in the tail section.

40:34.676 --> 40:35.848
Earth?

40:36.678 --> 40:38.137
What was it like?

40:38.764 --> 40:40.014
I don't remember.

40:40.641 --> 40:41.841
Why?

40:43.143 --> 40:46.204
I don't want to remember anything
before I met Gilliam.

40:50.734 --> 40:51.692
Yona.

40:53.445 --> 40:54.654
Are you clairvoyant?

40:55.364 --> 40:57.990
Clairvoyant? What's that?

40:58.283 --> 41:01.911
You always seem to know
what's behind the gates.

41:02.454 --> 41:04.288
Do you see things
in your mind?

41:20.472 --> 41:21.806
Don't open it.

41:22.557 --> 41:23.683
What?

41:25.053 --> 41:26.531
Stop!

43:06.453 --> 43:07.875
Be careful.

43:10.832 --> 43:11.986
You too.

43:39.736 --> 43:41.302
Team 2, move.

43:41.422 --> 43:42.808
Move forward!

45:44.736 --> 45:47.693
We're passing Yekaterina bridge!

45:52.327 --> 45:54.334
We're at the bridge, guys!

45:54.454 --> 45:57.435
10...9...8...7...

45:58.675 --> 46:03.587
5...4...3...2...1.

46:06.299 --> 46:08.135
Happy new year!

46:08.385 --> 46:10.642
Happy new year!

46:10.762 --> 46:13.497
I hate getting old, I hate it.

46:21.273 --> 46:23.321
Everybody down!

46:23.441 --> 46:24.853
Hang on.

46:33.159 --> 46:35.418
Impact!

46:40.138 --> 46:43.293
Not yet. A second one.

46:44.045 --> 46:46.266
Stay down.

47:00.642 --> 47:03.445
Nam, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

47:03.565 --> 47:05.743
He's high as a fucking kite.

47:12.157 --> 47:13.723
We're getting closer.

47:45.190 --> 47:46.607
Safe passage.

48:08.630 --> 48:10.339
One, two. One, two.

48:12.092 --> 48:16.610
Happy Yekaterina bridge, you filthy ingrates.

48:17.813 --> 48:22.309
You people, who if not for the benevolent Wilford...

48:22.477 --> 48:26.644
would have frozen solid 18 years ago today...

48:28.066 --> 48:29.823
You people...

48:29.943 --> 48:34.113
who would suck up the generous titty
of Wilford ever since...

48:34.280 --> 48:36.365
for food and shelter.

48:37.221 --> 48:38.575
And now,

48:39.202 --> 48:44.842
in front of our hallowed water supply section no less...

48:45.542 --> 48:47.850
you repay his kindness...

48:48.128 --> 48:50.806
with violent hooliganism.

48:53.675 --> 48:55.358
You scum.

48:59.931 --> 49:02.808
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

49:09.232 --> 49:13.861
My friend, you suffer from a misplaced optimism
of the doom.

49:14.696 --> 49:16.584
This is going to be good.

49:25.874 --> 49:27.458
What? What did he say?

49:27.709 --> 49:29.860
He said you guys are fucked.

49:31.713 --> 49:33.946
You should beat those sectioners.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.975
There's a tunnel right after Yekaterina...

49:39.095 --> 49:40.179
A tunnel?

49:40.722 --> 49:41.722
A fucking long one.

49:41.890 --> 49:43.773
What are you doing? Run.

49:47.562 --> 49:49.576
Everybody down!

49:49.696 --> 49:51.746
Go, go, go!

51:02.512 --> 51:04.839
Chan, get out, get out.

51:09.394 --> 51:12.068
Chan! We need fire!

51:12.188 --> 51:14.330
Chan, bring the fire.

51:14.450 --> 51:17.568
Throw them in the back, we're gonna get the lights here.

51:17.735 --> 51:19.634
Chan, the matches.

51:48.892 --> 51:52.082
We will crush you, motherfuckers!

51:53.326 --> 51:55.314
Officer Fuyu!

51:55.481 --> 52:00.122
What are you doing? Don't look at me.
Get them.

52:13.041 --> 52:15.440
Put me down, stop squeezing my leg.

52:32.101 --> 52:35.799
Surrender!
Surrender!

52:36.710 --> 52:40.822
Surrender, he'll kill me
if we don't surrender.

52:43.696 --> 52:45.050
Sure.

53:11.307 --> 53:13.175
Curtis!

54:03.317 --> 54:05.247
Stop!

54:05.737 --> 54:08.953
Stop everybody!

54:09.073 --> 54:10.985
Drop your weapons!

54:14.912 --> 54:16.169
Stop!

54:16.289 --> 54:17.958
Everybody stop!

54:23.963 --> 54:27.569
Do what he says, for crying out loud.

54:29.969 --> 54:31.964
Drop your weapons!

55:31.989 --> 55:33.519
Don't look.

56:14.115 --> 56:15.615
Survivors.

56:17.243 --> 56:19.303
Wash yourselves.

56:21.640 --> 56:24.040
The water supply section...

56:27.128 --> 56:28.879
Wash away the blood.

56:57.241 --> 56:58.742
Have you seen these kids?

57:00.661 --> 57:02.741
I don't know anything about...

57:06.736 --> 57:09.300
Where are they, you bitch?

57:09.420 --> 57:13.594
I don't know, it's not me.

57:14.675 --> 57:18.220
Tell us or we'll cut your arm
you bastard.

57:18.387 --> 57:20.523
Wilford knows.

57:22.037 --> 57:24.559
Wilford likes kids.

57:25.311 --> 57:26.186
He does.

57:26.354 --> 57:30.148
That's why he sent that yellow worm cloth
to get them for him.

57:30.483 --> 57:32.622
It's Wilford you want,
not me!

57:33.110 --> 57:34.986
Wilford likes kids?

57:35.650 --> 57:38.185
All he cares about is
his wretched engine.

57:38.305 --> 57:40.408
The engine is sacred.

57:40.701 --> 57:43.036
And Wilford is divine.

57:43.454 --> 57:45.914
Wilford is merciful.

57:48.793 --> 57:50.126
Call him.

57:51.462 --> 57:53.171
See if he'll come save you.

57:53.297 --> 57:54.506
Yes.

57:55.591 --> 57:58.051
Wilford the merciful.

57:58.219 --> 57:59.219
Call him.

58:00.221 --> 58:03.980
He won't come here,
he won't leave his engine.

58:04.100 --> 58:08.094
We're gonna rip you into little pieces,
he still won't come?

58:11.649 --> 58:15.360
When we control the water and turn that off,
he'll have to come.

58:15.778 --> 58:17.404
Turn off the water?

58:18.906 --> 58:21.700
Well, you'll only be condemning
your own people.

58:22.576 --> 58:24.452
The water comes from the front.

58:24.996 --> 58:29.614
The nose of the train, it breaks up the snow and ice
and turns it into water.

58:29.734 --> 58:31.963
Like an elephant's trunk.

58:32.378 --> 58:34.129
The water comes in the mouth.

58:34.255 --> 58:36.878
Not in the bum, Curtis.

58:37.533 --> 58:41.970
Yes, Wilford knows you well, Mr Curtis Everett.

58:42.305 --> 58:43.805
He's been watching you.

58:44.974 --> 58:47.733
And we know you won't harm
your own people.

58:49.145 --> 58:53.654
Too bad you couldn't save your second in command,
what was his name? Edgar?

58:53.774 --> 58:54.968
Shut the fuck up!

58:55.088 --> 58:56.657
Mr Curtis, I can help you.

58:56.777 --> 58:58.695
You can fucking die, is what you can do.

58:58.863 --> 59:01.072
No, I can help you.
I swear it.

59:01.282 --> 59:02.872
Listen to me.

59:02.992 --> 59:05.666
Wilford won't come here.
He's not coming.

59:05.786 --> 59:07.454
You've got to go to him.

59:07.621 --> 59:09.289
And I can take you.

59:09.457 --> 59:12.673
I know the train, I can guarantee you safe passage.

59:12.793 --> 59:14.711
Why the fuck would I trust you?

59:17.298 --> 59:18.923
Because I want to live.

59:20.676 --> 59:23.053
So you'd sell out Wilford the Benevolent?

59:24.430 --> 59:26.405
If I take you to the front...

59:27.558 --> 59:28.931
you have to kill him.

59:29.435 --> 59:30.924
I'll get you close enough.

59:31.270 --> 59:34.397
You kill him and let me live.

59:41.781 --> 59:42.864
Curtis?

59:51.332 --> 59:54.000
You still determined to push ahead?

59:55.086 --> 59:56.294
Of course.

59:56.962 --> 59:58.715
We're not even half way.

01:00:01.175 --> 01:00:04.325
You already got further than
anyone else.

01:00:06.514 --> 01:00:09.268
Further than McGregor, 4 years ago.

01:00:10.643 --> 01:00:14.684
10 cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter
unless you make it to the engine.

01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:19.317
They'll just regroup and attack us again.
We gotta pull them up at the roots.

01:00:20.194 --> 01:00:22.612
So many have been killed.

01:00:24.766 --> 01:00:26.606
We've lost so many.

01:00:27.827 --> 01:00:28.874
I know.

01:00:28.994 --> 01:00:30.870
You seen our men?

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.101
They are exhausted.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.626
I told them to wash themselves...

01:00:37.837 --> 01:00:40.046
so I can assess the damage.

01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:03.288
Let me go ahead.

01:01:12.121 --> 01:01:15.036
I got Mason now,
I can move a lot faster.

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:18.168
You stay here with the wounded
and guard the prisoners.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:21.671
When we take the Engine,
I'll call for you to lead us.

01:01:23.257 --> 01:01:24.883
Stop it, Curtis.

01:01:25.468 --> 01:01:27.335
Why are you doing that?

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.975
You know very well that you're already
our leader.

01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:38.046
You have to accept that.

01:01:44.028 --> 01:01:46.524
How can I lead if I have
two good arms.

01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:11.358
It's faded out.

01:02:17.186 --> 01:02:19.312
Better to have both arms...

01:02:20.147 --> 01:02:22.899
You can't do a lot with one, you know?

01:02:23.734 --> 01:02:25.860
Especially when you hold a woman.

01:02:26.028 --> 01:02:28.970
Much better to have two arms,
wouldn't you agree?

01:02:38.082 --> 01:02:40.500
When you get to the narrow bridge...

01:02:41.418 --> 01:02:43.545
big gate with a W on it.

01:02:46.382 --> 01:02:48.049
Wilford's behind that.

01:02:50.803 --> 01:02:52.762
Don't let Wilford talk.

01:02:55.474 --> 01:02:57.016
Cut out his tongue.

01:03:00.104 --> 01:03:02.824
Okay, let's all get in there.
Squeeze in.

01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:09.076
Perfect, perfect.

01:03:09.196 --> 01:03:10.988
The hat becomes you well.

01:03:13.242 --> 01:03:14.677
Now Grey...

01:03:17.121 --> 01:03:19.379
You must go with Curtis.

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:30.047
Oh, forgot somebody.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.472
Okay.

01:03:41.061 --> 01:03:42.145
Kronol.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.258
Don't mind me, back to work everyone.
Back to work.

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.011
Minister, are you okay?

01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:16.012
I'm okay.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.305
Please don't eat it...

01:04:17.473 --> 01:04:19.974
They're very friendly,
they won't bite.

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:22.352
They might bite a tomato, though.

01:04:27.024 --> 01:04:28.358
You can eat this too?

01:04:28.525 --> 01:04:31.944
A train baby wouldn't know about this.

01:04:32.112 --> 01:04:33.988
I grew up walking over it.

01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.991
This is located under the snow.

01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:38.201
Of the earth.

01:04:38.952 --> 01:04:40.370
What is this?

01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:42.246
It moves.

01:04:42.623 --> 01:04:44.207
Underground.

01:04:45.334 --> 01:04:46.793
What does this mean?

01:05:13.362 --> 01:05:15.571
Do any of you feel like sushi?

01:05:15.864 --> 01:05:18.282
Hell yeah...line that shit up.

01:05:18.617 --> 01:05:19.974
Right?

01:05:24.164 --> 01:05:25.847
You people are very lucky.

01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:29.085
This is only served twice in a year.

01:05:29.253 --> 01:05:31.407
In January and July.

01:05:31.755 --> 01:05:33.881
Why? Not enough fish?

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:36.259
Enough is not the criteria.

01:05:37.094 --> 01:05:38.177
Balance.

01:05:38.429 --> 01:05:42.515
You see, this aquarium is closed ecological system.

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:46.352
And the number of individual units...

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.731
must be very closely, precisely controlled.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.825
In order to maintain the proper
sustainable balance.

01:06:35.342 --> 01:06:38.571
No, you eat this.

01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:41.032
You know what that's made of?

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:50.506
Dig in.

01:07:14.107 --> 01:07:16.384
Curtis, my friend, do you think that we might...

01:07:16.504 --> 01:07:19.229
dispense for the restraint
for this next section?

01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:21.989
I'm not your friend. And why would I?

01:07:22.436 --> 01:07:24.367
For the sake of the young?

01:07:24.868 --> 01:07:26.139
Education?

01:07:29.289 --> 01:07:30.540
Quiet!

01:07:30.707 --> 01:07:32.625
Good morning, children.

01:07:32.793 --> 01:07:36.379
I'm pleased to present guests
from tail section.

01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:39.715
Yes, and what do we say to
tail section guests, children?

01:07:39.842 --> 01:07:43.553
Hello, tail section guests.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.816
Timmy!

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.010
Andy!

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:50.034
Andy?

01:07:53.689 --> 01:07:54.981
This little boy...

01:07:55.649 --> 01:07:56.780
His name is Timmy.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.109
This is my son.

01:07:58.443 --> 01:07:59.944
Please take a good look at the picture.

01:08:00.112 --> 01:08:00.951
I saw them.

01:08:01.071 --> 01:08:02.462
- When?
- Where?

01:08:02.823 --> 01:08:05.074
Came through there, went through there.

01:08:06.076 --> 01:08:07.743
Is that all, boy?

01:08:08.203 --> 01:08:09.294
Yes.

01:08:11.832 --> 01:08:15.284
- Were they crying?
- No, but they looked like they wanted to.

01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:18.504
I heard all Tail Sectioners...

01:08:18.671 --> 01:08:21.889
were lazy dogs and they all drink
their own shit.

01:08:22.009 --> 01:08:24.635
No, they're very nice.

01:08:24.803 --> 01:08:27.555
Very just and merciful.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.890
So it is.

01:08:29.057 --> 01:08:32.643
Minister Mason, we were just about to show
a video.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:33.810
Very good.

01:08:37.077 --> 01:08:39.520
Wilford!

01:08:40.777 --> 01:08:44.447
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's love
of locomotive was apparent.

01:08:44.615 --> 01:08:48.367
When I grow up, I'll live on a train forever.

01:08:48.487 --> 01:08:50.209
Forever!

01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:51.932
His early dreams were realized...

01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:55.255
when he founded his transportation empire...

01:08:55.375 --> 01:08:57.591
the Wilford Industries.

01:08:57.711 --> 01:08:59.837
But his greatest dream was to construct...

01:08:59.962 --> 01:09:02.095
a luxury locomotive cruiseline...

01:09:02.215 --> 01:09:06.140
connecting railways of the entire world
into one.

01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:10.671
A circular railway that extends for
438,000 km...

01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:13.439
and completes one circle every year.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.903
Impervious to the extreme cold of the Arctic,
and the scorching heat of the African desert...

01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:20.483
Wildford's miracle train is self-sustained...

01:09:20.651 --> 01:09:23.325
possesses the most sophisticated design...

01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:24.904
and advanced technology known...

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:27.031
As hard as it is to believe...

01:09:27.198 --> 01:09:30.395
people in the old world
made fun of Mr Wilford.

01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:32.787
They critized him for over-engineering...

01:09:32.912 --> 01:09:35.962
and over-equipping this
wonderful train.

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:39.042
But Mr Wilford knew
something they did not.

01:09:39.211 --> 01:09:40.175
And what was that?

01:09:40.295 --> 01:09:44.590
All world people are frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles.

01:09:44.758 --> 01:09:46.308
Well, sort of.

01:09:46.428 --> 01:09:50.261
Mr. Wilford knew that CW7 would freeze the world.

01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:54.058
So what did the prophetic Mr Wilford invent?

01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:56.310
...to protect the chosen
from that calamity?

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.485
The Engine!

01:09:58.605 --> 01:10:00.982
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:03.759
it will never die!

01:10:07.364 --> 01:10:09.514
What happens if the engine stops?

01:10:09.634 --> 01:10:11.498
We'd all freeze and die.

01:10:11.618 --> 01:10:13.869
But will it stop,
will it stop?

01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:15.043
No! No!

01:10:15.163 --> 01:10:16.914
Can you tell us why?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.592
The Engine is eternal,
the Engine is forever...

01:10:21.712 --> 01:10:23.886
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

01:10:24.006 --> 01:10:26.179
who is the reason why?

01:10:26.299 --> 01:10:30.304
Wilford!
Yeah!

01:10:30.424 --> 01:10:33.149
Wilford Wilford,
hip hurray!

01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:36.642
I love that one,
such a tonic.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.741
Oh, it's time children,
come this way.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.321
Don't trip now.

01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.968
Don't push, there's plenty of room.

01:10:45.088 --> 01:10:47.319
Who can tell me
what's coming up?

01:10:47.529 --> 01:10:50.329
The frozen 7.

01:10:50.449 --> 01:10:53.909
Pay attention, this tableaux
will surely be on the exam.

01:10:54.036 --> 01:10:56.912
15 years ago, in the third year
of the train...

01:10:57.039 --> 01:10:59.790
7 passengers tried to stop...

01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:02.877
Wilford's miracle train
and go outside...

01:11:03.086 --> 01:11:05.004
and what do we call this event, Magdalena?

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:07.006
The Revolt of the Seven.

01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:09.633
Very good, long before you were born.

01:11:10.052 --> 01:11:11.844
Of course they failed to stop the train.

01:11:12.012 --> 01:11:14.764
Instead they jumped out of the running train.

01:11:14.931 --> 01:11:16.223
Here they come now.

01:11:18.018 --> 01:11:21.277
Look, you see that?

01:11:22.773 --> 01:11:23.731
What?

01:11:24.274 --> 01:11:27.122
There they are, that's how far they made it.

01:11:32.115 --> 01:11:34.658
You see that woman in the front?

01:11:36.286 --> 01:11:39.163
She was the maid in the lead car.

01:11:40.207 --> 01:11:42.208
An Inuit.

01:11:42.918 --> 01:11:44.335
An Eskimo, actually.

01:11:45.087 --> 01:11:48.380
She knew all about the ice and snow.

01:11:48.799 --> 01:11:51.050
She believed she can survive outside.

01:11:51.259 --> 01:11:53.594
If we ever go outside the train?

01:11:53.804 --> 01:11:56.812
We'd all freeze and die.

01:11:56.932 --> 01:11:58.849
If the engine stops running?

01:11:59.017 --> 01:12:01.692
We'd all die.

01:12:01.812 --> 01:12:04.861
And who takes care
of the Sacred Engine?

01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:07.695
Mr. Wilford.

01:12:08.527 --> 01:12:11.810
Children, it's the new year eggs
from Mr Wilford.

01:12:12.322 --> 01:12:14.406
Touch them, they are still warm.

01:12:14.574 --> 01:12:16.784
These eggs are boiled using water...

01:12:16.952 --> 01:12:19.442
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.

01:12:19.562 --> 01:12:21.956
As a special treat,
we have playing for us...

01:12:22.082 --> 01:12:26.717
the world's renowned first chair violinist
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,

01:12:26.837 --> 01:12:29.231
Mr. Gerald McInster.

01:12:33.635 --> 01:12:35.177
Is that really Gerald?

01:12:35.345 --> 01:12:36.887
He looks damn great.

01:12:37.681 --> 01:12:38.931
Happy new year.

01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:44.812
No, thank you.

01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:54.472
Let's go Curtis.

01:13:01.872 --> 01:13:03.122
Happy new year.

01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:16.440
I thought the chicken was extinct.

01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:31.933
There are actually many things on board
that were rumoured to be extinct.

01:13:32.053 --> 01:13:33.147
Such as?

01:13:35.974 --> 01:13:37.214
This.

01:13:54.925 --> 01:13:56.847
Andrew!
No!

01:14:10.607 --> 01:14:12.696
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

01:14:22.037 --> 01:14:23.327
No.

01:14:48.186 --> 01:14:49.061
Curtis.

01:14:50.939 --> 01:14:52.481
You have to lead us.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.586
Curtis, my friend, we understand each other...

01:15:07.706 --> 01:15:09.868
listen to my words,
it wasn't me.

01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:29.601
We go forward.

01:15:41.614 --> 01:15:42.573
Open!

01:15:42.741 --> 01:15:43.741
Quickly!

01:16:34.876 --> 01:16:35.876
It's Mason.

01:16:36.044 --> 01:16:37.810
Shit, check her pulse.

01:17:02.679 --> 01:17:05.287
Hey, don't do...

01:18:14.309 --> 01:18:15.976
That does not look good.

01:18:33.536 --> 01:18:34.611
It happened.

01:18:48.927 --> 01:18:50.521
You've got the master key right?

01:18:54.474 --> 01:18:56.477
Wait, don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

01:19:33.221 --> 01:19:35.417
You've just killed a front section passenger...

01:19:38.768 --> 01:19:40.454
I didn't see a thing.

01:19:41.479 --> 01:19:43.772
Where are you going? Wait a minute!

01:19:44.047 --> 01:19:46.145
Could we talk about it for
just one second?

01:20:18.725 --> 01:20:20.387
Son of a bitch!

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.542
Close the door.

01:22:56.132 --> 01:22:57.048
Tanya.

01:23:05.349 --> 01:23:06.349
My Timmy.

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:10.071
My Timmy...

01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:30.749
We're gonna find him.

01:23:31.059 --> 01:23:32.463
I promise.

01:23:34.837 --> 01:23:36.092
I know.

01:23:42.053 --> 01:23:43.520
Thank you.

01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:46.484
Take this.

01:24:56.002 --> 01:24:58.628
Come on, motherfucker.
You got my Kronol.

01:24:58.748 --> 01:25:00.431
I want that shit.

01:25:02.258 --> 01:25:05.083
I want my Kronol back.

01:25:05.703 --> 01:25:07.509
That's my Kronol.

01:25:12.396 --> 01:25:15.384
I swear man, I'm gonna kill you.

01:27:00.835 --> 01:27:01.960
Open the door.

01:27:06.132 --> 01:27:08.333
Kronol first!

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:11.511
You want Kronol?
Here.

01:27:11.846 --> 01:27:12.749
Take it.

01:27:13.715 --> 01:27:15.932
Open it!
Open the gate!

01:27:20.563 --> 01:27:22.985
Are you looking for some trouble
or something?

01:27:49.884 --> 01:27:52.875
You got a problem with the gates?

01:27:56.599 --> 01:27:58.365
Here, smoke a cigarette.

01:28:17.828 --> 01:28:20.185
It is a great honor for you.

01:28:20.998 --> 01:28:24.382
This is the last cigarette of humanity.

01:28:24.502 --> 01:28:26.375
Go enjoy it.

01:28:30.424 --> 01:28:32.633
You ever been to the tail section?

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:37.643
Do you have any idea
what went on back there?

01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.596
When we boarded?

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.564
It was chaos.

01:28:50.069 --> 01:28:51.729
Hell, we didn't freeze to death.

01:28:51.849 --> 01:28:54.114
But we didn't have time to be thankful.

01:28:54.618 --> 01:28:57.367
Wilford's soldiers came
and they took everything.

01:28:59.036 --> 01:29:01.204
It was a thousand people
in an iron box...

01:29:01.372 --> 01:29:03.495
no food, no water.

01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:14.509
After a month,
we ate the weak.

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:30.400
You know what I hate about myself?

01:29:34.488 --> 01:29:37.159
I know what people taste like.

01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:45.039
I know that babies taste best.

01:29:59.138 --> 01:30:00.734
There was a woman.

01:30:02.725 --> 01:30:04.851
She was hiding with her baby.

01:30:07.688 --> 01:30:09.731
And some men with knives came.

01:30:13.611 --> 01:30:15.987
They killed her and took the baby.

01:30:19.742 --> 01:30:21.284
And then an old man...

01:30:23.245 --> 01:30:24.748
no relation, just...

01:30:25.623 --> 01:30:26.956
an old man.

01:30:27.458 --> 01:30:29.430
He stepped forward
and he said...

01:30:31.003 --> 01:30:32.462
"Give me the knife."

01:30:34.089 --> 01:30:36.633
Everyone thought he'd kill the baby himself...

01:30:37.968 --> 01:30:39.427
But he took the knife...

01:30:42.556 --> 01:30:44.224
and he cut off his own arm...

01:30:47.144 --> 01:30:48.811
and he said,
"eat this".

01:30:48.931 --> 01:30:50.581
"If you're so hungry..."

01:30:52.816 --> 01:30:55.944
"eat this, just leave the baby".

01:31:01.075 --> 01:31:03.201
I had never seen anything like that.

01:31:07.706 --> 01:31:09.791
And the men put down their knives.

01:31:14.505 --> 01:31:16.839
You probably guessed who that old man was.

01:31:21.887 --> 01:31:23.680
That baby was Edgar.

01:31:28.852 --> 01:31:30.728
And I was the man with the knife.

01:31:38.779 --> 01:31:40.446
I killed Edgar's mother.

01:31:52.931 --> 01:31:56.925
And then one by one,
other people in the tail section started...

01:31:57.417 --> 01:32:00.550
cutting off arms and legs and offering them.

01:32:02.511 --> 01:32:03.928
It was like a miracle.

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.567
I wanted to...

01:32:13.105 --> 01:32:14.454
I tried.

01:32:27.444 --> 01:32:31.456
A month later, Wilford's soldiers brought those
protein blocks.

01:32:31.707 --> 01:32:33.833
We've been eating that shit ever since.

01:32:38.672 --> 01:32:40.882
18 years I hated Wilford.

01:32:46.722 --> 01:32:49.265
18 years I've waited for this moment.

01:32:55.564 --> 01:32:57.065
And now I'm here.

01:33:13.374 --> 01:33:14.765
Open the gate.

01:33:18.045 --> 01:33:19.235
Please.

01:33:21.256 --> 01:33:23.633
Your story is so beautiful, Curtis.

01:33:25.969 --> 01:33:27.887
But I don't want to open the door.

01:33:30.093 --> 01:33:32.392
You know what I want?

01:33:34.686 --> 01:33:36.562
I want to open a door.

01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:41.776
But not this one.

01:33:43.362 --> 01:33:44.821
That one.

01:33:50.953 --> 01:33:53.417
The one that leads to the outside.

01:33:54.123 --> 01:33:57.375
We've been sentenced for 18 years.

01:33:57.543 --> 01:34:00.503
Everyone thinks it's a wall.

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:04.090
But it's a fucking door.

01:34:05.676 --> 01:34:09.707
Open it and get us out of here.

01:34:10.055 --> 01:34:13.474
And freeze to death?
What, are you crazy?

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.604
I know...

01:34:20.232 --> 01:34:22.400
But maybe we can survive.

01:34:24.695 --> 01:34:27.238
You remember Yekaterina bridge?

01:34:27.906 --> 01:34:30.825
When we got slaughtered with an ax.

01:34:31.493 --> 01:34:35.711
Every new year, I check something.

01:34:35.831 --> 01:34:37.790
We see the wreckage of a plane...

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:39.917
under the snow.

01:34:42.296 --> 01:34:44.088
For ten years

01:34:44.298 --> 01:34:48.891
the tail can barely be seen.

01:34:49.011 --> 01:34:53.668
But now I can see the fuselage and wings.

01:34:55.809 --> 01:34:59.527
There is less and less snow and ice.

01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:02.523
It melts.

01:35:03.901 --> 01:35:07.445
Snow becomes more fragile,

01:35:07.905 --> 01:35:10.031
it doesn't take much to get rid of everything.

01:35:12.201 --> 01:35:13.701
Recently,

01:35:15.454 --> 01:35:17.413
you know what I saw?

01:35:19.849 --> 01:35:22.043
Outside, there was...

01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:29.800
Drops.

01:35:30.552 --> 01:35:31.969
It is not worth telling it.

01:35:32.137 --> 01:35:34.222
You gotta take it easy
on that Kronol.

01:35:34.473 --> 01:35:37.363
Smelling that flammable bullshit is gonna fry your brain.

01:35:37.809 --> 01:35:39.769
You don't think I'm right.

01:35:40.646 --> 01:35:42.730
Kronol is the first...

01:35:45.275 --> 01:35:48.242
highly flammable chemical.

01:35:48.362 --> 01:35:49.961
A spark and boom!

01:35:52.699 --> 01:35:55.409
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

01:36:00.812 --> 01:36:04.210
I not only store these to get high,

01:36:04.823 --> 01:36:07.421
but to blow that gate.

01:36:07.965 --> 01:36:09.131
Matches, quickly.

01:36:09.466 --> 01:36:10.967
What the fuck are you doing?

01:36:11.593 --> 01:36:12.850
Give it to me!

01:36:12.970 --> 01:36:14.215
Take that off the door.

01:36:15.472 --> 01:36:16.305
Fire!

01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:32.642
Curtis Everett.

01:36:33.532 --> 01:36:36.305
I've been asked to extend
a formal invitation...

01:36:36.425 --> 01:36:39.131
from Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

01:36:40.622 --> 01:36:42.185
After you.

01:37:09.735 --> 01:37:11.694
Curtis? Is that you?

01:37:14.698 --> 01:37:16.157
Curtis, dear boy.

01:37:16.575 --> 01:37:17.713
Come in.

01:37:21.246 --> 01:37:23.122
Let's take a look at you.

01:37:23.582 --> 01:37:24.624
Are you hungry?

01:37:25.584 --> 01:37:28.461
You did a man's work,
coming all this way.

01:37:30.297 --> 01:37:32.513
Please, sit down.

01:37:32.633 --> 01:37:36.874
You are the first human being
to have walked the total length of this train.

01:37:37.304 --> 01:37:38.596
Tail to Engine.

01:37:38.972 --> 01:37:40.306
Did you know that?

01:37:40.891 --> 01:37:42.964
Well done, bravo.

01:37:44.561 --> 01:37:48.701
None of your people have ever been here,
to the Engine.

01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:51.150
I've never been to the tail section.

01:37:51.401 --> 01:37:53.944
Why not? Too dirty for you?

01:37:54.613 --> 01:37:56.822
Don't want to rub against the vermin
of the tail section?

01:37:57.491 --> 01:38:00.660
Do you think my station is without
its own drawbacks?

01:38:00.869 --> 01:38:02.203
It's noisy.

01:38:03.163 --> 01:38:04.497
And it's lonely.

01:38:07.042 --> 01:38:07.875
Right.

01:38:09.002 --> 01:38:10.086
Steaks.

01:38:10.587 --> 01:38:11.962
Plenty of room.

01:38:12.506 --> 01:38:14.770
This whore to bring you
anything you want.

01:38:15.384 --> 01:38:18.010
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.

01:38:18.303 --> 01:38:20.596
And everyone is in their place
except you.

01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:25.142
That's what people in the best place say
to the people in the worst place.

01:38:26.978 --> 01:38:29.730
There's not a soul on this train
that wouldn't trade places with you.

01:38:30.065 --> 01:38:31.607
Would you trade places with me?

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.895
Fuck you.

01:38:33.944 --> 01:38:35.444
Curtis, dear boy.

01:38:35.612 --> 01:38:39.699
The fact is that we are all stuck
inside this blasted train.

01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:42.576
We are prisoners in this hunk of metal.

01:38:42.703 --> 01:38:44.185
Medium rare?

01:38:44.663 --> 01:38:47.081
And this train is
a closed ecosystem.

01:38:47.249 --> 01:38:49.583
We must always strive for balance.

01:38:50.419 --> 01:38:54.088
Air, water, food supply, the
population....

01:38:54.256 --> 01:38:55.923
must always be kept in balance.

01:38:56.675 --> 01:38:59.993
For optimum balance, however, there have been times
when more...

01:39:00.113 --> 01:39:02.329
radical solutions were required.

01:39:02.449 --> 01:39:06.100
When the population needed to be reduced, rather...

01:39:06.768 --> 01:39:08.018
drastically.

01:39:11.314 --> 01:39:14.358
We don't have time
for true natural selection.

01:39:14.985 --> 01:39:19.280
We would all be hideously overcrowded
and starved waiting for that.

01:39:21.241 --> 01:39:22.950
The next best solution...

01:39:23.994 --> 01:39:27.292
is to have individual units
kill off other individual units.

01:39:27.998 --> 01:39:31.715
From time to time, we've had to stir the pot,
so to speak.

01:39:31.835 --> 01:39:35.511
The Revolt of the Seven,
The McGregor Riots...

01:39:35.964 --> 01:39:38.257
The Great Curtis Revolution.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.970
A blockbuster production with
a devilishly unpredictable plot.

01:39:43.346 --> 01:39:46.599
Who could have predicted your counter attack
with the torch at Yaketerina tunnel?

01:39:48.185 --> 01:39:49.310
Pure genius.

01:39:50.353 --> 01:39:52.486
That wasn't what Gilliam and I
had in our plan.

01:39:52.606 --> 01:39:53.603
What?

01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:59.910
Oh, don't tell me you didn't know,
Gilliam and I...

01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:01.238
Our plan.

01:40:03.033 --> 01:40:03.908
Gilliam?

01:40:04.743 --> 01:40:05.659
Gilliam.

01:40:06.411 --> 01:40:09.086
The front and the tail
supposed to work together.

01:40:09.706 --> 01:40:12.583
He was more than a partner, really.

01:40:13.739 --> 01:40:14.768
He was my friend.

01:40:14.888 --> 01:40:15.753
Bullshit.

01:40:16.046 --> 01:40:17.298
I don't believe you.

01:40:19.257 --> 01:40:23.302
Our original agreement was for the
insurgency to end at the Yaketerina tunnel.

01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:26.306
And all the survivors would go back
to the tail section...

01:40:27.018 --> 01:40:30.017
- To enjoy much more space.
- You're a fucking liar.

01:40:30.393 --> 01:40:31.811
Gilliam would never do that.

01:40:32.646 --> 01:40:34.480
It all worked out in the end.

01:40:34.731 --> 01:40:38.901
Your counter attack actually made
the insurgency 10 times more exciting.

01:40:39.152 --> 01:40:43.447
Unfortunately the front suffered more losses
than anticipated and...

01:40:44.032 --> 01:40:46.937
Gilliam had to pay the price.

01:40:49.788 --> 01:40:51.413
Ironic, isn't it?

01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:56.418
How people dramatically cross that thin barrier
between life and death...

01:40:57.128 --> 01:41:00.210
now there's just one last thing for us to do.

01:41:02.759 --> 01:41:04.176
Tally up the numbers.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.648
Hello Wilford, it's me.

01:41:18.358 --> 01:41:19.986
I'm at Gilliam's place.

01:41:20.318 --> 01:41:21.277
Hold on.

01:41:21.862 --> 01:41:23.821
Is it still the same number?

01:41:23.941 --> 01:41:26.574
Yes, it still stands at 74%.

01:41:26.694 --> 01:41:28.450
Okay, carry on.

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:30.202
Oh. wait.

01:41:30.537 --> 01:41:34.039
Spare 18, to celebrate our 18th year.

01:41:34.159 --> 01:41:38.080
It's an excellent idea...yes.

01:41:45.802 --> 01:41:46.877
Your people.

01:41:48.063 --> 01:41:51.272
Goddamnit Claude.
Mind the Engine!

01:41:52.934 --> 01:41:55.102
She's getting sensitive recently.

01:41:56.845 --> 01:41:59.023
Sit down and mind your table manners.

01:42:01.067 --> 01:42:02.151
Just relax.

01:42:05.864 --> 01:42:07.489
Calm down.

01:42:09.771 --> 01:42:13.267
Now I can see what Gilliam meant,
he told me you were brilliant and clever.

01:42:13.387 --> 01:42:14.997
But always so tense.

01:42:16.374 --> 01:42:18.500
When's the last time you got laid?

01:42:20.378 --> 01:42:23.964
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

01:42:32.515 --> 01:42:33.891
I'll miss Gilliam.

01:42:35.894 --> 01:42:38.187
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.149
He could go on for hours.

01:42:42.776 --> 01:42:44.735
All with only one arm.

01:42:46.446 --> 01:42:47.988
What's with that face?

01:42:49.658 --> 01:42:50.950
What's the matter?

01:42:52.077 --> 01:42:54.119
You look like a crazy person.

01:42:54.579 --> 01:42:56.747
As if there aren't enough crazies
on this train.

01:43:26.027 --> 01:43:27.105
Blood!

01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:31.591
Are you okay?

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.457
What? What happened?

01:43:38.331 --> 01:43:39.631
Get down.

01:43:55.682 --> 01:43:56.855
Yona.

01:43:56.975 --> 01:43:59.101
We must open this door.

01:44:01.021 --> 01:44:03.853
You see those cables?

01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:05.464
There are so many cables.

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.818
Die!

01:44:08.445 --> 01:44:09.653
Bastard!

01:44:10.363 --> 01:44:14.349
I believe it is easier for someone to survive on this train...

01:44:14.469 --> 01:44:16.744
if they have some level
of insanity.

01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.198
And as Gilliam well understood...

01:44:21.318 --> 01:44:25.461
we need to maintain the proper balance
of anxiety and fear...

01:44:25.712 --> 01:44:29.110
chaos and horror in order to keep life going.

01:44:29.841 --> 01:44:34.402
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:39.785
In that sense, the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

01:44:40.477 --> 01:44:41.351
Yona.

01:44:42.062 --> 01:44:43.479
Red, number 8.

01:44:43.688 --> 01:44:45.022
No, 7.

01:44:51.029 --> 01:44:52.488
Come with me, Curtis.

01:44:53.406 --> 01:44:55.240
Something I want to show you.

01:44:55.825 --> 01:44:57.076
You deserve it.

01:45:00.413 --> 01:45:01.330
Come on.

01:45:10.799 --> 01:45:12.747
She's waking up now.

01:45:41.079 --> 01:45:42.538
Cozy, yes?

01:45:43.206 --> 01:45:44.513
Peaceful.

01:45:45.333 --> 01:45:47.456
You are now in her heart.

01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:51.934
I've devoted my entire life to this.

01:45:53.049 --> 01:45:55.015
The Eternal Engine.

01:45:57.262 --> 01:45:59.640
It is eternity itself.

01:46:02.976 --> 01:46:05.602
Have you ever been alone on this train?

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.356
When was the last time you were alone?

01:46:10.817 --> 01:46:13.492
You can't remember, can you?

01:46:14.863 --> 01:46:16.786
So please do.

01:46:16.906 --> 01:46:18.586
Take your time.

01:47:18.509 --> 01:47:20.252
I just wrote it.

01:47:21.429 --> 01:47:23.210
It's for you, Curtis.

01:47:24.224 --> 01:47:25.330
Here.

01:47:38.205 --> 01:47:39.821
I am old.

01:47:41.157 --> 01:47:43.561
I want you to take my Station.

01:47:44.827 --> 01:47:46.906
It's what you always wanted.

01:47:50.833 --> 01:47:52.672
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

01:47:55.296 --> 01:47:57.214
You must tend the Engine...

01:47:58.174 --> 01:47:59.849
Keep her humming.

01:48:05.807 --> 01:48:07.099
Look, Curtis.

01:48:08.434 --> 01:48:10.143
Beyond the gate...

01:48:11.854 --> 01:48:16.608
Section after section percisely where they've always been
and where they'll always be.

01:48:16.776 --> 01:48:18.860
All adding up to what?

01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:22.140
The train.

01:48:24.575 --> 01:48:27.411
And now the perfectly correct number
of human beings...

01:48:27.531 --> 01:48:31.123
All in their proper places,
all adding up to what?

01:48:31.708 --> 01:48:32.833
Humanity.

01:48:33.501 --> 01:48:35.335
The train is the world.

01:48:36.504 --> 01:48:38.005
We the humanity.

01:48:40.341 --> 01:48:44.928
And now you have the sacred responsibility to lead
all of humanity.

01:48:45.555 --> 01:48:48.724
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

01:48:50.184 --> 01:48:53.095
You've seen what people do
without leadership.

01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:55.731
They devour one another.

01:49:18.338 --> 01:49:20.088
Yona, the Kronol!

01:49:24.302 --> 01:49:26.292
Yona, stop! No.

01:49:28.907 --> 01:49:30.359
No bullets?

01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:39.316
Get the Kronol then.

01:49:40.568 --> 01:49:41.693
Look at them.

01:49:43.446 --> 01:49:45.280
That's how people are.

01:49:46.324 --> 01:49:47.407
You know.

01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:49.326
You've seen this.

01:49:50.495 --> 01:49:51.828
You've been this.

01:49:55.249 --> 01:49:57.459
Ridiculous. Pathetic, aren't they?

01:49:58.503 --> 01:50:00.921
You can save them from themselves.

01:50:02.382 --> 01:50:05.300
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

01:50:11.265 --> 01:50:12.573
Curtis.

01:50:13.342 --> 01:50:15.143
This is your destiny.

01:50:20.554 --> 01:50:21.583
It's done!

01:50:21.703 --> 01:50:24.327
Curtis, matches.

01:50:28.032 --> 01:50:30.971
Curtis! The match!

01:51:04.235 --> 01:51:07.237
The space only allows for a very small person.

01:51:09.115 --> 01:51:11.275
Young children under 5.

01:51:11.742 --> 01:51:16.121
The engine lasts forever but
not all of its parts.

01:51:16.289 --> 01:51:20.757
That piece of equipment
went extinct recently.

01:51:20.877 --> 01:51:23.221
We needed a replacement.

01:51:24.046 --> 01:51:28.569
Thank goodness the tail section
manufactured a steady supply of kids.

01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:31.136
So we can keep going manually.

01:51:35.057 --> 01:51:36.600
Fucking bastard!

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.291
Yona...

01:52:03.961 --> 01:52:05.170
Take the fire.

01:52:23.314 --> 01:52:24.718
Only one left.

01:52:35.826 --> 01:52:39.246
Critical engine shutdown.

01:52:39.366 --> 01:52:41.102
Okay.

01:52:41.576 --> 01:52:44.585
Please stand at a safe distance.

01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:00.099
Andy? Is that you?

01:53:02.130 --> 01:53:03.279
Andy!

01:53:04.021 --> 01:53:05.605
Do you remember me?

01:53:06.023 --> 01:53:08.316
Andy, stop, listen to me.

01:53:08.609 --> 01:53:10.891
Don't go up those stairs,
listen.

01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:13.282
Andy!

01:53:14.532 --> 01:53:16.491
Come here, come over here.

01:53:19.287 --> 01:53:20.787
Andy, listen to me!

01:53:21.622 --> 01:53:22.914
Get out of there!

Goddammit Andy, listen to me.

01:53:30.923 --> 01:53:35.225
Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:39.556
You know everyone has their own
