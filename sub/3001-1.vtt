00:59.726 --> 01:01.603
You know what I want to be
when I grow up?

01:01.644 --> 01:03.813
- What?
- A fisherman.

01:05.105 --> 01:07.442
I want to go fishing every
day till I'm rich

01:07.484 --> 01:09.652
so I can move
right next door to the jailhouse,

01:09.694 --> 01:11.363
so I can be close to my mommy.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.910
She got arrested for drugs again,
so she has to go back.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.082
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:24.501 --> 01:29.255
My mommy's breath smells so bad
'cause she smokes so much crack.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.760
What do you think?

01:34.302 --> 01:36.304
What do I think? About what?

01:39.307 --> 01:41.309
My mommy's bad breath.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.478
Maybe it'll get better.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.985
Thank you. That helps.

01:51.486 --> 01:55.156
- Yeah. Yeah! Thanks for nothing, Derek.
- What is the matter with you, Kimmie?

01:55.198 --> 01:57.992
All right, come on.
We got to go see your grandpa.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.161
Not Grandpa. He's a kook!

02:00.537 --> 02:04.874
Oh, my goodness. You are limber!

02:12.424 --> 02:13.591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.397
Well, hello! I think I know her.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.037
Mr. Zisman?

02:42.579 --> 02:44.247
Mr. Zisman.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.082
Mr. Zisman!

02:46.416 --> 02:47.417
Hi.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.754
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

02:51.087 --> 02:56.593
Your wife, she took a turn for the
worse last night and she passed away.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.722
I'm so sorry.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.104
I thought she'd never die.

03:10.607 --> 03:15.445
I'm going to let you process this,
and I'll be back in just a moment, okay?

03:15.779 --> 03:18.448
Thank you. Thank you, Doc!

03:19.949 --> 03:24.954
Don't get me wrong, I'm upset,
but she was a crabby old bat.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.082
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.418
She hadn't given me any nookie
since the '90s.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.754
And then it was only out of spite.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.632
She's in a much better place.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.469
And I'm in a much better place.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.183
Did you hear that, Leroy?
We're free!

03:47.185 --> 03:48.687
I'm free.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.337
Hello, lady.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.933
Thanks a lot.

04:54.878 --> 04:55.879
Shit!

05:29.788 --> 05:33.500
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.419
Miss.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.963
Sir, can you help me?
Can you help me, sir?

05:39.297 --> 05:40.924
I don't expect you to understand,

05:41.007 --> 05:44.302
but I have my penis
stuck to the soda machine.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.306
Gabriel! I'm stuck.

05:49.432 --> 05:54.104
- What's wrong?
- My penis is stuck in the machine!

05:54.479 --> 05:56.815
Gabriel! Help me!

05:57.148 --> 05:59.150
Help me! Gabriel!

05:59.984 --> 06:01.319
Gabriel!

06:05.990 --> 06:08.493
Sir. Could you help me, sir?

06:10.036 --> 06:11.788
This nigga's dick's stuck
in the machine, yo!

06:11.830 --> 06:13.164
Please don't announce it!

06:13.456 --> 06:14.624
It's fucking embarrassing!

06:14.708 --> 06:16.459
Can you help me
instead of announcing?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.962
Well, help! Give me a hand!

06:23.174 --> 06:25.343
He's trying to get it out!

06:25.969 --> 06:28.638
- Oh, no!
- Stop, man!

06:31.516 --> 06:32.517
Sir?

06:32.851 --> 06:35.020
Don't... It's not
going to come out.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.229
Fuck.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.857
Don't! Quit pulling on it.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.443
I got to get... Oh, God!

06:42.652 --> 06:45.697
Push! Push! God! Push! Push!

06:45.780 --> 06:47.824
Oh, God! Oh, God!

07:06.426 --> 07:09.429
<i>Thank you, kind people,
for being here today.</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:15.185
<i>I never thought my wife's funeral
would be filled with complete strangers,</i>

07:15.226 --> 07:19.189
<i>but we've outlived all our friends.</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:22.942
<i>I was hoping my daughter and
grandson could make it but...</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:26.613
<i>They didn't.</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:33.912
<i>So, I would especially like to
thank the choir and caterers,</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:38.875
<i>and all the nice people
sitting before me.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:41.086
<i>I wish I had more time with her.</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:45.715
<i>I wish so much of our time
had not been consumed by combat.</i>

07:47.050 --> 07:49.719
<i>I wish I'd tried a little harder
to make that happen.</i>

07:50.637 --> 07:52.514
<i>Because she's gone now.</i>

07:52.555 --> 07:56.309
<i>And our history on this earth
has been written...</i>

07:58.311 --> 07:59.646
<i>Baby.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:01.731
I'm glad you made it.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.651
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.404
Sit.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.656
This is my daughter and grandson.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.910
Can I have a word with you?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.247
Yeah, I'm in the
middle of something.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.915
Billy, just stay
there for a second.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.084
I just want to
talk to your granddad outside.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.168
Okay, Mom.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.338
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.302
Hi, Billy.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.595
<i>What's so important?</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.889
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
that she's dead and everything,</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:36.599
<i>but I'm in some serious shit, okay?</i>

08:36.640 --> 08:38.768
<i>- What is it this time?</i>
- You tell him about the microphone.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.062
<i>Don't even start that with me!
Not now!</i>

08:41.104 --> 08:43.063
<i>Okay? It wasn't even my fault!</i>

08:43.106 --> 08:45.775
<i>This cop, he's got
a bug up his ass,</i>

08:45.859 --> 08:48.945
<i>and then they give me this
public defender who's a fucking idiot!</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:51.364
<i>- And...</i>
- Sir, excuse me. The microphone is on.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.284
<i>Please, just give me a moment.
Just give me a moment.</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:59.789
<i>Look, I violated my parole and now
they're gonna send me to jail.</i>

09:00.457 --> 09:03.001
<i>I just need you to
take Billy across the country</i>

09:03.126 --> 09:04.961
<i>so he can be with his dad for a while.
Okay?</i>

09:05.003 --> 09:06.087
<i>What?</i>

09:06.129 --> 09:09.090
<i>I can't have Bobby with me now.
I'm in mourning!</i>

09:09.132 --> 09:11.009
<i>It's Billy. Billy!</i>

09:11.092 --> 09:13.303
<i>How am I supposed to know
what his name is?</i>

09:13.386 --> 09:14.929
<i>You never brought him around!</i>

09:14.971 --> 09:16.348
<i>Shit.</i>

09:16.431 --> 09:19.142
<i>I cannot have Billy with me now.</i>

09:19.184 --> 09:21.936
<i>I am a free man
for the first time in 46 years</i>

09:21.978 --> 09:25.482
<i>and I can't be saddled
with that cockblock!</i>

09:25.565 --> 09:26.691
<i>That's just fine.</i>

09:26.775 --> 09:27.942
<i>You were never there for me
when I was little,</i>

09:27.984 --> 09:29.778
<i>so I guess it's no
different now, is it?</i>

09:29.819 --> 09:32.322
I'm going to talk to my mom.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.165
<i>I am very sorry.</i>

09:42.832 --> 09:45.168
<i>Everyone's very
emotional right now.</i>

09:45.335 --> 09:46.711
<i>It's a very difficult
time for the family.</i>

09:49.756 --> 09:51.841
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

09:53.677 --> 09:56.763
Sweetie, come here.
That's your mother's.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.683
- She told me I could have it.
- Give me the... Give it...

09:59.724 --> 10:02.769
Don't do this in front of them!
Don't do this right now!

10:02.852 --> 10:05.522
- Just stop...
- Oh, no!

10:05.605 --> 10:06.940
Oh, God! Jesus!

10:07.774 --> 10:08.858
Oh, no.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.068
Grandma?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.404
- I love you.
- Oh, baby.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.407
Sorry, Daddy.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.075
Oh, baby!

10:19.077 --> 10:20.745
Oh, my God!

10:21.079 --> 10:23.915
Sing! Please, choir, sing something.
Somebody help.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.378
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:31.548
<i>Down in my heart,
down in my heart</i>

10:31.589 --> 10:35.260
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

10:35.593 --> 10:38.596
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

10:39.222 --> 10:42.308
<i>I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart</i>

10:42.392 --> 10:43.393
<i>Where?</i>

10:43.435 --> 10:46.104
<i>Down in my heart,
down in my heart</i>

10:46.438 --> 10:50.442
<i>I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart</i>

10:50.775 --> 10:53.778
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:57.615
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

10:58.116 --> 11:00.285
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

11:42.994 --> 11:44.329
Fuck.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.794
Where are we going?

11:51.002 --> 11:53.296
We're going here to get on a
computer call with your dad

11:53.380 --> 11:55.382
to see when he's gonna
pick your little ass up.

11:55.507 --> 11:59.177
And I got someone meeting us to help
me and your father communicate,

11:59.302 --> 12:01.012
seeing how we don't get along.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.306
Are you Mr. Zisman?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.724
- Hi.
- Shirley Kreska.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.226
- Nice to meet you, Shirley.
- Nice to meet you.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.312
Well, tell me the
purpose of the call.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.898
His mother is going to jail.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.317
But she wanted me to
get him to his father.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.362
We've had lots of problems
out of the father.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.031
He's nearly impossible
to communicate with.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.493
But is your goal to
get him to his dad?

12:23.660 --> 12:24.994
Yes, yes.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.372
I got him up on the computer now.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.710
All right, Chuck. This is Shirley.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.212
Hi, Chuck. I'm a local counselor,

12:34.504 --> 12:38.258
and I'm just here to help the two of you
reach whatever goals you want to reach

12:38.383 --> 12:40.260
and just help the two
of you talk together.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.386
<i>Okay.</i>

12:41.511 --> 12:47.892
So, Kimmie is going to jail again,
all right?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.728
<i>Doesn't surprise me.</i>

12:50.020 --> 12:53.732
So I'm gonna need you to come
get Billy, like, from me.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.527
Why are you shaking your head?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.530
<i>'Cause this is real bad timing
right now for me.</i>

13:00.697 --> 13:03.533
<i>And I'm having some problems
with my business right now.</i>

13:03.575 --> 13:06.578
- Okay.
- Your business? What business is that?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.079
<i>I sell computers.</i>

13:08.371 --> 13:10.373
Sell... He couldn't sell
pussy on a troop train.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.208
<i>That's a disgusting thing to say.</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:13.710
Okay, but that doesn't help.
That doesn't help.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.253
You're right. You're right.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.713
I'm sorry for insulting you.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.092
Are you serious?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.803
This is a disaster.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.431
All right, Chuck.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.600
If you can't come to Lincoln,

13:29.768 --> 13:32.270
then I'll just bring him to you
in North Carolina.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.939
<i>No. 'Cause I don't have money
to take care of a kid.</i>

13:35.023 --> 13:37.817
<i>My cousin, he just had
to take his baby girl,</i>

13:37.901 --> 13:40.570
<i>and the state's paying him
$600 a month for free.</i>

13:40.612 --> 13:42.906
Are you sure you want
him to go to him?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.616
<i>- He's getting 600 bucks?
- A month.</i>

13:44.741 --> 13:46.076
Wait, what are they saying?

13:46.117 --> 13:48.787
She's saying possibly
he could get money for keeping him.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.914
<i>I think I can work
something out.</i>

13:51.122 --> 13:56.961
<i>I think that if Irving was to bring him
here to Raleigh, I could take the kid.</i>

13:57.253 --> 13:59.464
And then if it didn't work out...

13:59.756 --> 14:02.258
<i>600 bucks a month
will make it work for me.</i>

14:02.467 --> 14:05.845
So... And that isn't guaranteed,
what she just said.

14:05.929 --> 14:06.930
It's something
you would have to investigate.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.973
<i>No, no, it's guaranteed.
She's always right.</i>

14:09.057 --> 14:10.308
<i>It's a done deal, man.
Drop him off.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:13.019
- All right, 2:00 on Sunday.<i>
- 2:00 p.m. Sunday.</i>

14:15.146 --> 14:17.273
<i>Great, man. Great. Great.</i>

14:17.315 --> 14:19.442
<i>There goes like half my inventory.</i>

14:19.484 --> 14:20.944
What a wonderful business you have.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.362
Okay. Chuck, what's your last name?

14:22.654 --> 14:24.614
<i>- Muskie.</i>
- M...

14:24.656 --> 14:27.617
<i>- M-U-S-K-I-E.</i>
- Okay.

14:27.826 --> 14:31.162
- D-O-U-C-H-E is how you spell it.<i>
- Yeah.</i>

14:31.621 --> 14:35.166
<i>That's right.
F-A-G-O-T is your last name.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:37.293
Your son's right here,
if you don't mind.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.337
Let's just walk away.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.007
<i>Suck it.</i>

14:42.298 --> 14:43.633
"Suck it," that's nice.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.343
<i>Suck a bowl of dicks.</i>

14:45.468 --> 14:48.013
- Bye, Dad.<i>
- Bye, Billy!</i>

14:48.680 --> 14:49.973
Bye.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.487
How much is this?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.823
Is there a price tag on it?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.324
I don't... There's a...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.161
That's one of my
wife's favorite lamps.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.871
- It's very pretty.
- Yes.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.791
She died of vagitosis.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.502
It's kind of like bad breath,
but the vagina.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.547
It wasn't the main cause, but...

15:23.214 --> 15:25.050
- It didn't help.
- Yeah.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.134
That's...

15:27.385 --> 15:28.928
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.890
Do you like this chair?

15:32.474 --> 15:33.850
That is pretty cool.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.560
It's only $25.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.395
That's nice.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.857
This bed's going for
a pretty good price.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.068
I'd like to lay down
and take a nap myself.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.195
- I'm tired all the time.
- Yeah.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.696
Is it one of those
ones that adjusts?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.281
Yes, ma'am, it's really good.

15:48.365 --> 15:53.536
It's one of those that kind of
sit up while you're watching TV.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.247
Here, try... I'll...

15:58.041 --> 15:59.918
Try to adjust it a little.

16:01.711 --> 16:02.754
Stop!

16:03.046 --> 16:04.631
Oh, my God!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.383
Stop. Oh, my God!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.885
Stop, stop! Stop!

16:09.302 --> 16:10.345
Unplug it!

16:10.387 --> 16:13.056
Oh, my God!
What are you trying to do to me?

16:13.932 --> 16:15.767
All I did was push
the little button!

16:16.559 --> 16:20.730
Oh, God! Put it down!
Put it... Cramp! Cramp!

16:21.940 --> 16:22.941
It's unplugged!

16:24.275 --> 16:25.652
It's unplugged, I pulled the plug.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.986
Oh, my God.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.489
Unplug that thing
over there, please.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.907
I'm getting off.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.076
Oh, God.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.369
- Let Grandpa sit.
- I pushed the little button.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.495
He told me to push
the little button.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.247
Let Grandpa sit.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.085
I think I'm going to have a heart attack.
I really do.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.797
Well, let's not make this
all about you, honey.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.925
No, no, I'm telling her.
I'm not making it...

16:52.345 --> 16:53.346
Look...

16:53.805 --> 16:55.265
Just calm down. It's okay.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.641
My breathing won't come back.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.811
You can have the bed for $50.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.647
No, I don't want that bed.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.330
Coming!

17:24.169 --> 17:25.502
Hey, sir, how are you?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.297
Do you have a bed
we're supposed to pick up?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.257
- Right this way.
- Alrighty.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.509
- My name's Irving, what's your name?
- Tom.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.428
Tom. How are you, Tom? Come on in.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.472
This is my grandson, Billy.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.973
- Hi, Billy. How are you?
- Hi.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.475
- What's your name, sir?
- I'm James.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.853
James. How are you, James?
Come on in. We're back here.

17:43.355 --> 17:47.359
And my wife just passed away
a couple days ago

17:47.484 --> 17:49.986
and the damn funeral home
had a little misunderstanding.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.364
Like, you know what,
"We'll just take her right back."

17:53.615 --> 17:55.533
We want to get her in my trunk,

17:55.617 --> 17:58.995
because we're gonna
bury her down south a ways.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.916
If you could help me to my car,
I would really appreciate it.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.377
Let me just...

18:06.711 --> 18:08.046
Okay...

18:08.380 --> 18:10.382
Just wrap her up.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.551
I think it'll be easiest
if you just pull like that.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.554
Yeah. She was a pain in my ass
when we were married

18:16.846 --> 18:20.183
and she passed away,
she's still being a pain in my ass.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.895
Just grab that right there.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.564
James, will you get the head?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.069
Be gentle with her.

18:31.903 --> 18:32.987
Here you go, James.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.449
- Here you go.
- Lord have mercy. Jesus.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.701
There you go.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.536
Don't let her fall
out of there, James.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.079
Get a good hold on her.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.748
Oh, man. We're...

18:45.417 --> 18:47.877
We got to get this little
boy to his father.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.963
His mom just got thrown in jail.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.548
My mom's on drugs.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.924
Lord have mercy!

18:53.008 --> 18:55.218
Thank you, boys.
I couldn't carry her myself.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.806
Just put her right in there.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.143
And we got blankets
to keep her warm.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.146
All right, be careful with her.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.278
All right.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.323
Thank you. Thank you, James.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.201
Come here, Billy.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.912
Grab his hand. Can we say a prayer?

19:24.998 --> 19:29.085
Lord, please look after Billy and I
on our journey with Ellie.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.841
And Lord, please look after these men
because they were very sweet

19:35.175 --> 19:36.593
and they're also accomplices

19:36.676 --> 19:39.429
to probably
what was technically a crime,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.639
but we're not gonna say anything.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.726
Come on, man! Are you serious?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.353
In your name we pray. Amen.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.520
Amen.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.938
All right.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.608
Let me ask you a question,
is the bed really going?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.235
No, no. I just needed help with her.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.112
But no one's going to come out...

19:56.529 --> 19:58.281
No one's going to come out
to help if you say,

19:58.323 --> 19:59.949
"Can you come help me
commit a crime?"

20:00.075 --> 20:02.285
No one's gonna help. So...

20:02.327 --> 20:05.038
We...

20:05.121 --> 20:08.291
That's why we had to
tell a little fib.

20:08.333 --> 20:12.003
But we surely appreciate it.
And our lips are sealed.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.505
- Later.
- Thank the men.

20:13.588 --> 20:14.589
See you, Billy.

20:14.673 --> 20:15.965
- Thank you.
- Thank you, fellas!

20:16.049 --> 20:17.050
See you later.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.386
God bless you.
God bless you, James. Thank you!

20:19.469 --> 20:21.137
Thanks for the crime!

20:21.179 --> 20:23.598
Now get your crap.
We got to hit the road.

20:26.810 --> 20:27.852
All right.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.355
Grandpa, do you think
we'll have time to go fishing?

20:30.605 --> 20:33.608
Don't worry me with that.
Just get in the damn car.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.836
I hope you went
to the bathroom already.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.379
- Nope.
- "Nope"?

20:55.046 --> 20:57.132
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.322
Can I turn on the AC?

21:21.656 --> 21:22.824
No.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.828
Can I turn on the radio?

21:27.162 --> 21:28.329
No!

21:28.997 --> 21:31.499
Let's just play the quiet game.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.838
Can we get something to eat?

21:37.839 --> 21:39.424
You're already eating.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.010
- But I'm hungry!
- Whatever.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.846
Anything to get out of this car.

21:46.514 --> 21:50.518
<i>Hola,</i> gorgeous!
I gotta feed this little prick.

21:51.019 --> 21:56.024
She is <i>muy bonita,</i> huh? My goodness!

21:57.359 --> 21:59.694
Grandpa, look at that ride!
Can I go ride it?

21:59.944 --> 22:01.696
- What?
- Can I go ride that?

22:02.864 --> 22:05.033
Yes. Shit.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.453
- Scram.
- Thank you.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.914
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.125
My Spanish name
is <i>El Mucho Ding-Dong.</i>

22:14.542 --> 22:17.087
- It doesn't work!
- Oh, God.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.880
- Grandpa!
- What?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.340
This thing doesn't work!

22:21.216 --> 22:23.927
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Fix it!

22:24.719 --> 22:27.389
- Can't you see I was talking to a lady?
- Yes, but look!

22:27.430 --> 22:29.808
Did you put money in there? God.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.727
- Try it. It doesn't work.
- Oh, God!

22:41.778 --> 22:42.779
Nothing!

22:49.327 --> 22:50.704
Sit down, sit down.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.628
- I'm all right!
- Sit down, sir.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.171
Sit, sit, sit!

23:00.255 --> 23:02.173
Are you okay, Grandpa?

23:02.257 --> 23:03.842
Look what happened!

23:04.426 --> 23:06.678
- Jesus!
- It didn't work!

23:06.761 --> 23:08.638
Why'd you tell me to get in there?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.682
'Cause I wanted you to fix it.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.101
Well, it's fixed!

23:13.601 --> 23:16.354
Unbelievable!
You could have broke my neck!

23:16.771 --> 23:18.356
I didn't do anything!

23:20.275 --> 23:22.610
I can't do it. I can't do it.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.863
- Do what?
- This!

23:26.281 --> 23:27.866
I can't do this.

23:28.450 --> 23:32.120
I said I'd get you to your father's,
but I didn't say how.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.290
Grandpa, my leg's falling asleep!

23:35.623 --> 23:36.833
Look, you little shitbird,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.878
I'm not driving you and you're
too young to ride the bus,

23:40.003 --> 23:41.838
so you keep quiet in there!

23:45.300 --> 23:46.885
You need some help?

23:46.968 --> 23:48.678
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.972
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.225
- Here we go.
- Okay.

23:54.309 --> 23:58.646
I'm going to send this
to Raleigh, North Carolina.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.231
Raleigh? Okay.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.816
Eighteen width.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.530
- Forty-seven?
- Forty-seven.

24:07.572 --> 24:08.907
- Forty-seven.
- Yeah.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.327
- Damn it.
- Okay.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.870
There's something
moving around in there.

24:13.995 --> 24:14.996
Really?

24:15.497 --> 24:16.831
- No. No.
- No?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.418
There's something in that box!

24:20.502 --> 24:21.711
No.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.714
There's nothing in the box?
It sounds like it!

24:24.756 --> 24:28.176
I do hear stuff in here,
but it's not coming from there.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.928
- Okay. Can we unstrap it?
- You mind if we unstrap it?

24:30.011 --> 24:32.889
- Yes... No, let's unstrap it.
- Okay.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.557
Grandpa, I got to pee.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.935
What...

24:38.019 --> 24:39.521
Keep it down.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.400
It's a statue.
I have a statue in there.

24:43.441 --> 24:47.070
- It still has batteries in it or something?
- Yes, it has the batteries in it still.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.571
Okay. Okay.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.742
Yeah, it's just one of those kind
that you hit a button and it...

24:52.826 --> 24:54.369
So we shook it.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.787
Yeah, yeah.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.709
Grandpa, I got to pee real bad.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.085
It's a statue.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.628
Are you sure?

25:03.712 --> 25:05.964
It was settling. It was settling.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.924
Okay. All right.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.634
Can we get it weighed?
Because I gotta...

25:09.884 --> 25:12.512
- You gotta get out?
- Yes, and I appreciate you girls...

25:15.640 --> 25:16.641
Would you...

25:16.975 --> 25:18.309
God, what are you doing?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.311
We were shipping a human being!

25:20.562 --> 25:21.980
Oh, my.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.398
Oh, my!

25:23.648 --> 25:24.899
We can't ship humans.

25:24.941 --> 25:30.113
I'm trying to get him to his father,
and I don't want to drive him.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.740
Oh, my goodness!

25:31.990 --> 25:33.324
It'll get there overnight.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.909
You know that they're just gonna be

25:34.951 --> 25:36.661
throwing you around and everything,
don't you?

25:36.745 --> 25:39.664
Well, give me a pen
and we'll write "fragile" on it.

25:40.081 --> 25:42.292
Are you sure you want to do this?

25:42.334 --> 25:43.835
You need a blanket?

25:43.918 --> 25:45.795
- We can't ship a human!
- I'll take one.

25:45.837 --> 25:48.506
You can
if you didn't know this happened.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.426
I can't ship you. You're living!

25:51.676 --> 25:54.929
- Should we call the police on them?
- Oh, no! No police.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.477
Just help me get him out of the box.
I'll take him.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.562
Shit! Come on.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.783
Been in this car all damn day!

26:15.116 --> 26:16.868
I need a break.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.538
Where are we going?

26:20.622 --> 26:23.166
Grandpa's going to
play a little bingo.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.876
- Can I come?
- No!

26:25.418 --> 26:29.881
Look. They don't allow kids and I'm
going to be talking to ladies in there.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.384
And I don't need you cockblocking.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.302
<i>G-51.</i>

26:35.970 --> 26:37.305
<i>N-42.</i>

26:40.475 --> 26:41.976
<i>G-60.</i>

26:43.144 --> 26:45.480
It's been a while since I've played.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.234
Nice to meet you, ma'am. Good luck.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.485
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.404
- My name is O.Z.
- O.Z.!

26:52.487 --> 26:53.571
- O.Z.
- All right!

26:53.988 --> 26:55.699
Can I cheat off you?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.409
<i>B-2.</i>

26:57.492 --> 26:59.160
<i>G-46.</i>

27:00.662 --> 27:05.667
O.Z., what do you say we blow this joint
and go play a little strip bingo outside?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.127
Stop it.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.672
That damn dauber's not...

27:11.506 --> 27:14.217
God damn it.
Done spilled everywhere.

27:18.638 --> 27:19.806
<i>N-62.</i>

27:21.307 --> 27:22.851
Stop the game. Stop!

27:22.934 --> 27:25.353
Oh, my gosh!

27:27.772 --> 27:30.025
I think this shit's done gone bad.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.819
Oh, my God!

27:33.361 --> 27:37.032
He just drunk the dauber shit.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.075
Oh, man! You can't do that!

27:39.367 --> 27:40.702
Hell, no!

27:41.995 --> 27:43.288
Stop.

27:43.371 --> 27:44.539
Stop!

27:44.581 --> 27:46.416
Stop? Hell, keep going!

27:46.708 --> 27:49.377
- You're making everybody sick.
- No, come on, come on!

27:49.878 --> 27:53.214
Let's go back to the damn game,
all right?

27:55.216 --> 27:58.553
God damn!
You guys are driving me to drink!

27:59.387 --> 28:01.056
I need a drink.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.353
What the hell you got?

28:06.436 --> 28:09.773
I got a damn margarita!
Who wants a margarita?

28:13.068 --> 28:15.487
O.Z., half of this is for you.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.073
How about a little fun, people?

28:38.134 --> 28:41.429
Excuse me? Sir?
Can you tie my shoe, please?

28:41.471 --> 28:42.555
Yeah, sure.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.474
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.770
- Are you happily married?
- Yeah, I guess so.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.858
Why do you ask?

28:55.443 --> 28:58.071
- I want a new dad.
- Do you?

28:58.154 --> 29:00.198
Yeah, sorry.

29:00.281 --> 29:03.034
- What's your name?
- Dan.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.787
Hey, Dan, I got an idea.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.291
How about me being your new kid?

29:13.294 --> 29:15.588
I don't know
if it's really quite that simple.

29:15.672 --> 29:17.632
You know, you can't really...

29:17.674 --> 29:18.675
Why?

29:18.758 --> 29:22.220
You can't really trade kids
between families, can you?

29:22.303 --> 29:24.139
Sure you can, Dad.

29:24.556 --> 29:28.852
You know, when I was overseas,
when you would sleep with a prostitute,

29:28.893 --> 29:31.604
they would squeeze lime juice
on your <i>schmeckle</i>

29:31.688 --> 29:33.565
to see if you had any diseases.

29:33.648 --> 29:35.191
And if you went...

29:36.317 --> 29:39.487
It means you got something,
'cause the cuts burn.

29:40.155 --> 29:43.158
I never went... But one time.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.748
It's all cleared up now, though.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.167
Ma'am, it's all cleared up.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.543
- Okay.
- All right.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.629
Just to prove to you
I don't have anything, ladies,

29:56.713 --> 29:59.299
I'm gonna squeeze this lime juice
on my <i>schmeckle</i> right now.

29:59.424 --> 30:00.884
Oh, my God!

30:00.925 --> 30:01.926
Okay.

30:02.344 --> 30:04.763
Why resist? Watch this.
Here it goes. Here it goes!

30:04.846 --> 30:07.182
Nothing. Nothing.

30:07.682 --> 30:09.517
I got nothing.

30:09.601 --> 30:11.853
That is free advertising
right there.

30:12.270 --> 30:15.607
It did sting a little when it got to
my bunghole though, I'll tell you that.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.401
That's just between us girls.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.029
I'm gonna have to
have that checked out.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.865
What happened to your dad?

30:25.283 --> 30:26.785
Hey, Dad.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.953
Yeah, what happened to him?

30:29.037 --> 30:30.789
No, you're my dad.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.415
High five, Dad.

30:33.208 --> 30:34.876
Down low. Too slow.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.879
Yeah, that one's been around
for a while.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.217
Who are you here with?

30:42.425 --> 30:44.427
You. My new dad.

30:44.719 --> 30:47.222
Well, I'm not your new dad. But...

30:47.263 --> 30:48.723
You're funny.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.395
Hey, Dad, look at me in the eye.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.189
- Like...
- I love you.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.608
Anyway, I need to...

31:01.403 --> 31:04.739
I got stuff I have
to do, so be safe.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.701
Love you, Dad!

31:09.744 --> 31:11.287
Here she is!

31:11.329 --> 31:12.831
Here I am. You want to buy some 22s?

31:13.081 --> 31:15.000
- What are 22s?
- You wish you was 22.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.086
They look like 36D's to me.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.338
No.

31:20.422 --> 31:23.591
No? 36 full C's.

31:24.092 --> 31:26.803
22s, that's what they are!

31:27.762 --> 31:29.514
Can I use your pen?

31:30.932 --> 31:32.684
Yes, you may, sweetheart.

31:32.767 --> 31:36.521
- All right! How you doing?
- Okay.

31:36.604 --> 31:40.650
- You know, you're pretty sexy.
- Thank you.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.777
I mean really sexy.

31:43.653 --> 31:44.696
I...

31:44.779 --> 31:47.282
- I have to take this up there.
- All right.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.707
What's your name, sweetheart?

32:00.462 --> 32:02.297
I'm getting froze out.

32:04.632 --> 32:08.136
- Did you win any money at bingo?
- No.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.640
You shouldn't drink so much.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.184
Pipe down!

32:14.642 --> 32:16.311
Oh, God.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.314
Do you have any idea
how heavy you are?

32:19.564 --> 32:22.108
Do you have any idea
how I don't give a shit?

32:23.151 --> 32:25.320
Let's get something to eat.

32:29.491 --> 32:30.992
Make a left.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.746
Okay. Go here! No, Billy!

32:34.829 --> 32:36.164
It's heavy.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.001
No, push me this way.
Push me this way.

32:41.169 --> 32:43.922
Lisa! Lisa, come look at this.

32:47.175 --> 32:49.678
He's drunk, and he's drinking beer.

32:51.179 --> 32:53.181
He got a six-pack.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.183
Push me.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.520
Hello?

32:59.521 --> 33:02.273
- We'd like some food.
- Okay, what you need?

33:03.191 --> 33:04.693
Chickens.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.861
Chicken breast.

33:07.696 --> 33:09.531
Any kind of breast.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.868
- Sir, you need some help?
- Yes, I need some service!

33:13.952 --> 33:15.704
Okay, well, you got to...
We'll get you served,

33:15.787 --> 33:17.455
I need to push you over here.
We'll bring it out to you.

33:17.539 --> 33:18.748
Need to get you away from here.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.458
Let me push you over
to the side, okay?

33:20.542 --> 33:23.086
Can you let go of the thing there?
I'll push you over to the side.

33:23.128 --> 33:24.421
- Okay, but...
- What do you want?

33:24.462 --> 33:27.632
- Do you guys serve beers?
- No, we don't serve beer.

33:27.716 --> 33:31.136
- How about whiskey?
- No, we don't have whiskey, either.

33:31.219 --> 33:34.723
Sir, what do you have
that's good in there for a hangover?

33:34.973 --> 33:37.809
To eat?
I mean, greasy food is always good.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.395
But a hangover? Sleep.
He got to sleep it off.

33:40.645 --> 33:43.940
Man, that girl working the window,
she was nice-looking.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.152
- She was nice-looking?
- Yeah.

33:47.318 --> 33:48.611
Well, you just chill
out here for a minute.

33:48.695 --> 33:49.904
We're gonna see
if we can get you some help.

33:49.988 --> 33:54.951
Okay, we need some chickens
and a big side of poontang.

33:56.578 --> 33:58.580
The poontang? There's some inside.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.666
Well, I want some to go.
Go hook that up.

34:01.916 --> 34:04.169
He's stuck on Lisa.

34:04.252 --> 34:05.920
That's what he want.

34:07.797 --> 34:09.215
- Black bush gal?
- Lisa!

34:09.299 --> 34:10.632
He said he wanted poontang.

34:11.009 --> 34:12.302
He'll hook you up!

34:12.344 --> 34:14.387
- What does he want?
- He wants you.

34:14.471 --> 34:16.139
What? No, he don't.

34:16.181 --> 34:17.514
Excuse me, honey.

34:17.599 --> 34:20.351
That's what he's hollering.
That's what he wants, Lisa.

34:20.435 --> 34:23.103
Honest to God, strike me dead.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.523
He wants some black bush.

34:25.607 --> 34:26.775
Lisa, that man is 80 years old.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.985
I turned around and I said,
"Did he say what I thought he just said?"

34:30.027 --> 34:31.696
You better go out there.

34:31.780 --> 34:34.741
He is 80 years old
in a shopping cart.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.326
Cut the man a break.

34:47.212 --> 34:49.380
<i>Siempre avante.</i>
Know what that means?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.966
- No.
- Onward and forward.

34:53.301 --> 34:57.972
You know, rubber on wheel
is faster than rubber on heel.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.641
That's what Lightnin' Hopkins says.

34:59.724 --> 35:02.227
- You know who Lightnin' Hopkins is?
- No.

35:02.310 --> 35:05.522
What about Komodo dragons?
You know what those are?

35:05.563 --> 35:06.731
No.

35:06.815 --> 35:09.818
- You don't know who Johnny Cash is?
- No.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.861
Ask me what the secret of comedy is.

35:11.986 --> 35:14.948
- What is...
- Timing! Get it?

35:16.658 --> 35:17.826
What?

35:18.743 --> 35:20.912
- That's not funny?
- No.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.539
Tough room.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.253
I love this song!

35:32.507 --> 35:33.883
You're kind of...

35:35.427 --> 35:36.594
Weird.

35:55.530 --> 35:56.698
Dirty bastard!

36:05.040 --> 36:06.291
You okay?

36:06.374 --> 36:07.876
Oh, God.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.882
- You all right, Grandpa?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.384
Caught me right in the puss!

36:16.426 --> 36:19.137
You want some ice?
You need me to get some ice for you?

36:19.220 --> 36:21.806
Yeah, maybe some ice.

36:21.890 --> 36:24.559
My damn wife put these
in here and it...

36:28.229 --> 36:30.565
Did you see the <i>tuchas</i> on that one?

36:36.946 --> 36:40.116
- Should I get a basket?
- No. We ain't gonna need one.

36:45.789 --> 36:48.458
- You like white bread?
- Yep.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.210
Good.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.466
- What are you doing?
- Just go with it.

37:00.470 --> 37:02.806
Are we going to get
in trouble for this?

37:03.306 --> 37:05.475
No. If someone says anything,

37:05.558 --> 37:09.396
just tell them that your grandpa's old
and doesn't know what he's doing.

37:09.479 --> 37:12.065
- You want turkey or ham?
- Ham.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.733
Ham?

37:13.817 --> 37:15.068
All right.

37:18.863 --> 37:21.574
Here. Get you a lot.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.410
Let's get some damn mustard.

37:23.785 --> 37:24.786
Here.

37:26.496 --> 37:28.164
- That's a lot of mustard.
- Eat it!

37:38.425 --> 37:40.760
So I eat it quick,
so we don't get caught.

37:43.263 --> 37:45.932
- Sir.
- What's going on?

37:46.016 --> 37:47.934
- What's going on?
- Yes.

37:48.018 --> 37:51.354
You eating everything here.
You don't pay yet.

37:52.022 --> 37:55.025
You eating things here in the store
and you don't pay yet.

37:55.859 --> 37:58.361
- So he took that one.
- Please don't get mad.

37:58.445 --> 37:59.779
He took this.

37:59.863 --> 38:01.197
- And you put it there.
- No.

38:01.281 --> 38:04.451
- Yes, I saw. It's in the camera.
- No.

38:04.534 --> 38:05.952
Okay.

38:06.036 --> 38:07.704
Please don't get mad at my grandpa.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.622
He's old and he doesn't
know what he's doing.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.041
What's going on?

38:11.207 --> 38:13.126
- Where am I?
- You know what he's doing, baby.

38:13.209 --> 38:15.295
You know what he doing
and you doing it with him.

38:15.378 --> 38:17.130
Sometimes he shits himself.

38:17.213 --> 38:19.632
- No. You took that one.
- And sometimes he sits in it like a baby.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.927
I don't shit myself,
you little prick.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.804
- Sometimes he pisses the bed.
- Okay, you opened these...

38:24.888 --> 38:26.389
- Do not!
- Do, too!

38:26.473 --> 38:27.724
- Do not!
- Do, too!

38:27.766 --> 38:30.143
- Do not!
- You opened the ham and you don't pay.

38:30.226 --> 38:31.394
- Can I have his...
- Close the doors.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.562
I'm gonna call the police.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.564
Can he have his chocolate milk
back, please, ma'am?

38:45.075 --> 38:46.868
They won't notice a thing.

38:47.535 --> 38:49.746
That's how it looks
most of the time anyway.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.790
Come on. Come on.

38:51.873 --> 38:53.750
Let's go quick. Let's go quick.

38:54.209 --> 38:55.877
Come on. Let's go this way.

39:00.715 --> 39:02.050
Thank you!

39:02.550 --> 39:04.219
Get the hats! Get the hats!

39:05.220 --> 39:06.971
Come on, come on!

39:07.055 --> 39:08.223
Come on!

39:09.224 --> 39:10.892
What are y'all doing?

39:11.976 --> 39:13.812
- It was $3.99!
- Stop!

39:13.895 --> 39:16.064
- Yeah. Come on!
- You're not going anywhere!

39:16.314 --> 39:19.943
- Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
- No. You're not going anywhere.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.320
Hey, Billy, get in! Start it up!

39:22.404 --> 39:23.905
They're going to
take that child away from you.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.240
I wish they would!

39:25.657 --> 39:27.325
- Get back inside!
- I'm sorry.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.703
- Get your ass inside!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.454
You are sorry!
You're sorry as hell!

39:31.496 --> 39:34.290
- No, I'm not gonna...
- You're eating what you stole!

39:34.332 --> 39:37.127
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- You buy it!

39:37.168 --> 39:38.628
- You pay for it.
- If I had money, I would.

39:38.670 --> 39:41.965
You had enough money to come in here
and the audacity to try to steal from me.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.508
These are pretty good, by the way.

39:43.591 --> 39:46.052
I don't give a shit. I ought to
stuff it down your damn throat.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.971
- You're very pretty when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off!

39:48.013 --> 39:50.181
- You're very lovely when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off.

39:57.939 --> 39:59.274
All right, come on.

40:04.529 --> 40:05.613
Hi.

40:12.620 --> 40:13.788
All right.

40:18.376 --> 40:19.586
Okay.

40:21.838 --> 40:23.340
I got her.

40:26.092 --> 40:27.093
Jesus...

40:30.096 --> 40:32.015
Here we go. Jesus.

40:32.515 --> 40:33.558
Oh my goodness.

40:33.641 --> 40:35.268
It's all right. She's already dead.

40:35.352 --> 40:39.314
- What?
- Yeah, she died a few days ago.

40:40.648 --> 40:42.984
We're just bringing her in
'cause it's respectful.

40:43.026 --> 40:45.362
Don't want to leave
her in the trunk.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.322
All right.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.032
Get in there!

40:49.074 --> 40:50.075
Shit.

40:53.495 --> 40:57.332
Grandpa's going out for a walk.
You stay in the room.

40:59.167 --> 41:01.169
See you later, old man.

41:02.170 --> 41:03.672
Stay in there, damn it.

41:04.005 --> 41:05.590
My grandson.

41:05.965 --> 41:10.804
Hey, you don't know where any, like,
dance clubs or anything like that are?

41:11.805 --> 41:14.140
Like, with lots of black ladies.

41:14.474 --> 41:16.476
There's one on...

41:17.310 --> 41:18.978
Richard Boulevard.

41:19.062 --> 41:20.188
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:20.397 --> 41:23.233
- I'm really fond of the black ladies.
- Yeah.

41:23.316 --> 41:26.820
Yeah. They used to call me
Jizzy Gillespie when I was younger.

41:26.903 --> 41:28.405
Yeah?

41:30.323 --> 41:31.825
Hey, get in the room!

42:09.404 --> 42:10.905
Hello. How are you?

42:14.951 --> 42:16.119
Hello, ladies!

42:16.161 --> 42:19.622
- Hey, grandpa, how you doing?
- Good! How you doing, baby?

42:19.706 --> 42:20.874
All right!

42:31.551 --> 42:36.139
- Hi, sweetheart. You are nice-looking!
- Thank you!

42:36.222 --> 42:39.059
Can I get a Colt 45, please?

43:06.002 --> 43:07.962
He's got his jim dog out.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.924
That thing's about like that!

43:17.472 --> 43:21.810
Hey, big boy!
Is this one of them stripteaser shows?

43:22.560 --> 43:23.728
Yeah, it's males.

43:24.437 --> 43:29.109
That's perfect, because I like to catch
these women when they're soggy.

43:29.359 --> 43:30.944
So you boys do a good job tonight,

43:31.027 --> 43:32.237
- all right?
- Okay.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.072
Get them all hot and bothered,

43:34.155 --> 43:36.783
and I'm gonna try to swoop in
and get me a little.

43:36.866 --> 43:38.034
Okay, okay.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.495
- Are you one of them dancers?
- Yeah, I am.

43:40.745 --> 43:43.164
I bet you got a pretty
big Tootsie Roll, huh?

43:43.373 --> 43:44.624
Man, what the fuck?

43:45.583 --> 43:46.584
What?

43:47.419 --> 43:49.754
Get the fuck away from me, man.

43:51.006 --> 43:52.465
But I mean, if you're a dancer...

43:52.549 --> 43:55.844
I'm sorry, I was just...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:58.763 --> 44:00.807
How are you ladies doing down here?

44:00.890 --> 44:03.643
- Fine. How are you?
- Good, good.

44:03.727 --> 44:06.271
I came here alone,
so I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

44:06.354 --> 44:08.189
What made you come in here?

44:08.440 --> 44:10.567
I don't... I was walking,

44:10.650 --> 44:11.735
- down the street...
- Walking?

44:11.776 --> 44:13.445
You weren't walking nowhere!

44:13.695 --> 44:16.072
What you gonna do,
watch it or watch us?

44:16.156 --> 44:18.074
I came to watch you girls.

44:20.326 --> 44:22.495
You ladies are gonna
get all worked up,

44:22.829 --> 44:25.790
and then hopefully
old Irving can swoop in there.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.002
- What's your name?
- Irving.

44:31.087 --> 44:33.840
Maybe some of these ladies
will want a serving of Irving,

44:33.923 --> 44:35.175
if you know what I'm saying.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.678
That's right. Thank you.
Thank you, mama!

44:38.928 --> 44:42.265
<i>If you're ready for the next entertainer,
everybody say, "I am!"</i>

44:42.349 --> 44:43.683
I am!

44:46.353 --> 44:47.937
I love chocolate!

44:49.439 --> 44:51.441
He's harder than a horseshoe!

44:51.858 --> 44:53.360
How hard are you?

44:53.610 --> 44:56.780
I'm pretty loose right now,
but I could probably get it going.

44:57.030 --> 44:59.532
We want to see yours.
We want you to walk the red carpet.

44:59.783 --> 45:00.784
She wants to see mine?

45:00.867 --> 45:02.118
Walk the red carpet.

45:02.202 --> 45:03.787
I'll show her mine right now!

45:03.828 --> 45:05.747
We're gonna make it rain.
Walk the red carpet.

45:05.830 --> 45:08.500
I'm gonna go...
I'm going to walk the red carpet.

45:08.583 --> 45:10.418
Yeah, I'm gonna shake it!

45:17.759 --> 45:19.761
<i>I don't know what the
fuck is going on.</i>

46:03.179 --> 46:04.389
What?

46:56.024 --> 46:59.027
Excuse me?
Have you seen my grandpa?

46:59.361 --> 47:00.445
Your grandpa?

47:00.695 --> 47:03.198
I think he's lost.
He's kind of an idiot.

47:03.448 --> 47:05.200
Why is he an idiot?

47:06.034 --> 47:07.452
'Cause he's lost, duh.

47:07.702 --> 47:08.787
Does he have a cell phone?

47:09.037 --> 47:13.208
He's probably drunk right now.
He went to a strip club last night.

47:13.875 --> 47:17.545
I don't know what to tell you, son.
Oh, gosh.

47:18.046 --> 47:20.382
Excuse me? Excuse me?

47:22.050 --> 47:23.385
Screw you.

47:29.724 --> 47:32.060
- Who you looking for?
- I'm looking for my grandpa.

47:32.394 --> 47:34.104
Your grandpa's not here.

47:34.145 --> 47:37.482
- Is he in the Champagne Room?
- There's nobody in there.

47:37.732 --> 47:39.401
- Let me check.
- No.

47:39.734 --> 47:42.237
- Let me just go check.
- I told you.

47:43.905 --> 47:45.907
He's, like, persistent.
He wants to go in there.

47:45.990 --> 47:48.576
And he's talking about having
a great time in the Champagne Room

47:48.618 --> 47:50.787
like he's, like, 21.

47:52.997 --> 47:54.040
What's up?

47:54.124 --> 47:56.251
- Is this an adult bookstore?
- Yeah.

47:56.292 --> 47:58.837
- Is my grandpa in here?
- No.

47:59.254 --> 48:00.714
Is there somebody, like...

48:00.797 --> 48:02.674
Is somebody, like,
watching you or something?

48:02.757 --> 48:03.758
No.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.136
Did you get that shirt
at Tramps R Us?

48:06.302 --> 48:07.345
What?

48:07.429 --> 48:10.849
- Did you get that shirt at Tramps R Us?
- No.

48:11.349 --> 48:13.101
- How old are you?
- Eight.

48:13.435 --> 48:15.437
- What's your name?
- Billy.

48:15.687 --> 48:17.022
When did you get here?

48:17.105 --> 48:19.024
You're asking a lot of questions
for a stripper.

48:19.274 --> 48:21.109
- What's your stage name?
- What?

48:21.192 --> 48:22.444
What's your stripper stage name?

48:22.485 --> 48:24.237
I don't have a stage name.
I'm not a stripper.

48:24.446 --> 48:25.697
I'll just call you Cinnamon.

48:25.780 --> 48:27.157
- Cinnamon?
- What?

48:27.198 --> 48:30.118
- I look like a stripper?
- Yeah. In a good way.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.786
- In a good way?
- Oh, my...

48:32.871 --> 48:35.582
Why don't you wait on me
and I'm gonna come, like,

48:35.665 --> 48:37.125
take you to whatever
hotel you're at?

48:37.459 --> 48:38.877
You don't need to be out here
by yourself.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.795
You're gonna, like, get hurt.

48:41.463 --> 48:43.715
There's a bunch of crazy people
out here.

48:44.716 --> 48:46.384
Apparently, your
grandpa's one of them.

48:46.468 --> 48:48.386
Bye, Cinnamon. I got to go.

48:48.470 --> 48:50.638
No. And I'm not Cinnamon!

48:55.810 --> 48:57.979
- How you doing?
- Rough night.

49:00.982 --> 49:03.276
Grandpa! Where have you been?

49:03.401 --> 49:05.236
Not now.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.155
I've been worried!

49:27.759 --> 49:30.095
What're we gonna do
with Grandma's body?

49:31.179 --> 49:32.764
I don't know, buddy.

49:34.182 --> 49:36.226
We met with someone
to discuss that,

49:36.267 --> 49:40.522
but your grandma, she wasn't
very cooperative that day.

49:41.189 --> 49:45.694
Just said some nonsense about
throw her off a bridge for all she cares.

49:55.203 --> 49:57.539
You know what a woman likes?

49:57.872 --> 49:59.708
A new fishing rod?

50:00.208 --> 50:01.376
No.

50:02.043 --> 50:03.294
Magic!

50:04.212 --> 50:06.548
I can prove it. You want to see?

50:06.881 --> 50:08.049
- Sure.
- All right.

50:11.219 --> 50:14.180
Hello, ma'am.
You wouldn't flatter an old man

50:14.264 --> 50:16.224
by watching him do a magic trick,
would you?

50:17.726 --> 50:20.395
That's good.
All right, keep your eye on the...

50:20.729 --> 50:23.398
I'm going to make it disappear.

50:24.899 --> 50:26.735
No charge, either.

50:27.110 --> 50:30.238
Okay. 'Cause I don't
have any money.

50:30.488 --> 50:32.490
There we go! Where'd it go?

50:32.741 --> 50:34.075
- In your sleeve?
- No.

50:34.325 --> 50:35.994
- What's that on your thumb?
- What?

50:36.578 --> 50:38.747
- Look.
- Will you give me that?

50:40.582 --> 50:43.209
- Why don't you beat it?
- But I want to stay with you.

50:43.293 --> 50:44.627
Why don't you beat it?

50:45.587 --> 50:48.590
Grandpa's got to talk to some tail.

50:49.382 --> 50:50.550
He's...

50:50.925 --> 50:53.928
He's a little cooter stretcher
is what he is.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.931
You from this town?

50:57.599 --> 50:58.767
Yeah. Born and raised.

50:58.850 --> 51:01.353
Born and raised.
You're awful pretty. My goodness!

51:01.436 --> 51:02.520
Thank you.

51:02.771 --> 51:05.940
A beautiful young lady like
yourself, I have something for you.

51:06.191 --> 51:07.484
Oh, Lordy.

51:07.525 --> 51:10.862
Here we go. You're so kind.

51:10.945 --> 51:12.530
- There you go.
- Thank you.

51:12.614 --> 51:15.784
Those are for you.
They're specially scented.

51:15.992 --> 51:17.035
I bet.

51:17.285 --> 51:19.954
You got time for an old
man like me, maybe?

51:20.038 --> 51:24.000
We can blow this garmooshky
and go chase around a little.

51:24.376 --> 51:25.752
Not tonight I don't.

51:25.877 --> 51:27.295
- Not tonight?
- No.

51:28.963 --> 51:31.216
You on a lunch break?

51:32.550 --> 51:33.718
Yeah.

51:33.802 --> 51:35.929
- You married?
- Yeah.

51:36.137 --> 51:38.139
Oh, boy. "Married" married?

51:38.390 --> 51:42.227
"Married" married
to a gun-toting police officer.

51:42.310 --> 51:45.313
- Oh, God! Of all the luck.
- There you go.

51:48.149 --> 51:50.110
- All right, good times.
- See ya.

51:50.193 --> 51:51.194
Bye.

51:51.319 --> 51:53.697
If I had all the money
I spent on poontang,

51:53.780 --> 51:55.240
you know what I'd do with it?

51:55.824 --> 51:58.159
- What?
- Spend it on poontang.

52:00.161 --> 52:03.832
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

52:05.208 --> 52:08.044
One, two, three,

52:08.128 --> 52:10.422
four, five, six,

52:10.839 --> 52:12.173
seven, eight...

52:12.424 --> 52:14.050
Come on, you're a lefty.
You can be stronger than that.

52:14.134 --> 52:16.094
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

52:16.177 --> 52:19.097
It's because you're holding
it so close to the edge.

52:19.180 --> 52:20.598
- Hello.
- Hi.

52:20.682 --> 52:23.560
- I see you have met my grandson.
- Yeah.

52:24.019 --> 52:27.188
- My name is Irving.
- I'm Lisa.

52:27.522 --> 52:30.650
- What was your name...
- She's American. You don't have to bow.

52:30.734 --> 52:32.444
- What?
- You have a weird grandpa.

52:33.695 --> 52:35.030
Where'd you go?

52:35.280 --> 52:38.700
You told me to beat it
'cause you were gonna talk to some tail.

52:41.619 --> 52:43.121
I said I... To...

52:43.538 --> 52:46.875
I was going to beat it
to go deliver some mail.

52:47.208 --> 52:48.543
Oh, jeez.

52:48.877 --> 52:51.713
You are hotter
than a Puerto Rican picnic.

52:51.755 --> 52:53.340
Oh, my God, thank you!

52:54.716 --> 52:56.051
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, my goodness!

52:56.384 --> 52:59.387
- You babysit big boys?
- I do, yeah.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.139
I mean big boys like me.

53:01.348 --> 53:02.432
No.

53:02.515 --> 53:04.017
- No?
- Definitely not.

53:05.393 --> 53:06.728
Oh, well.

53:07.062 --> 53:09.064
You win some, you lose some, kid.

53:10.231 --> 53:12.442
- Nice to meet you!
- See you. Bye-bye.

53:12.484 --> 53:13.568
Goodbye.

53:14.277 --> 53:17.238
That was a slower no
than I usually get.

53:17.739 --> 53:20.116
You may be useful after all!

53:20.158 --> 53:22.243
You ever play charades?

53:25.580 --> 53:26.748
Excuse me?

53:27.332 --> 53:31.169
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

53:31.586 --> 53:32.671
Thank you. Thank you so much.

53:39.177 --> 53:40.929
Okay. I need to go.

53:41.554 --> 53:42.722
I need to go. Oh, my God.

53:42.806 --> 53:44.808
Grandpa wants to know
if you're married!

53:50.772 --> 53:54.526
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

53:58.029 --> 53:59.989
How do you know
that's what he said?

54:10.125 --> 54:11.292
What did he say?

54:11.334 --> 54:14.004
He says you make him
feel young again.

54:15.338 --> 54:17.799
Do you know what he's saying,
or are you just making stuff up?

54:18.299 --> 54:19.676
I know what he's saying.

54:20.010 --> 54:23.304
- Does he seem crazy to you sometime?
- Yeah.

54:23.805 --> 54:25.140
Excuse me!

54:25.181 --> 54:26.182
Okay.

54:30.478 --> 54:33.481
He wants to know where we can
get a hoagie around here.

54:34.274 --> 54:36.026
A hoagie sandwich.

54:40.113 --> 54:41.614
Hoagie sandwich.

54:43.616 --> 54:44.868
Excuse me.

54:50.957 --> 54:52.625
He says you look like a nice Jew.

54:54.586 --> 54:56.379
No, no, no, no...

54:59.466 --> 55:00.967
He says you have very nice shoes.

55:01.801 --> 55:04.220
- Thank you.
- Yeah, nice.

55:05.638 --> 55:06.681
We're just...

55:07.015 --> 55:08.683
We're just clowning around.

55:08.725 --> 55:12.145
I'm trying to teach him
how to hit on women.

55:12.228 --> 55:15.565
Okay.
I can kind of see what was going on.

55:15.607 --> 55:17.275
- How did he do?
- You did very good.

55:17.567 --> 55:19.569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

55:19.652 --> 55:22.155
- He's sweet. He's my grandson.
- Okay.

55:22.238 --> 55:23.239
Yes.

55:23.323 --> 55:27.660
He goes to bed around
8:00 p.m. or so. So...

55:28.828 --> 55:30.997
After that, I'm pretty much free.

55:31.831 --> 55:34.167
No, I'm not...
I'm not in the market right now.

55:34.501 --> 55:35.835
You know, I...

55:36.753 --> 55:40.465
I might be too old to stir the gravy,
but I can still lick the spoon,

55:40.590 --> 55:42.425
that's for damn sure.

55:42.842 --> 55:44.010
Well, good luck.

55:44.177 --> 55:45.512
All right.

55:45.762 --> 55:47.097
- We'll be right here.
- Okay.

55:47.347 --> 55:48.848
All right, sweetie.

55:51.685 --> 55:53.103
Good job, buddy.

55:57.941 --> 56:00.819
- Have you kissed a girl yet?
- Yeah.

56:01.277 --> 56:03.738
- Was she your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.949
- How long did you go out with her?
- A day.

56:05.990 --> 56:07.992
A day...

56:08.118 --> 56:09.327
A day?

56:09.577 --> 56:12.080
That sounds like
some of my relationships.

56:12.956 --> 56:14.290
Grandpa!

56:16.584 --> 56:18.169
Get that damn thing out of the way!

56:25.760 --> 56:27.804
Jesus Christ!

56:27.846 --> 56:30.640
Why would you put a penguin
right in my driving spot?

56:31.099 --> 56:32.934
In your...
Sir, there's a curb there.

56:32.976 --> 56:34.269
The driveways are there and there.

56:34.477 --> 56:36.980
Look, lady, get off my back!

56:37.647 --> 56:38.982
I'm an old man.

56:39.024 --> 56:41.276
What happened to
"the customer's always right"?

56:41.818 --> 56:43.945
Yeah, but you ain't right
about running over the penguin.

56:43.987 --> 56:46.322
Why would they
put the penguin in my spot?

56:46.406 --> 56:49.617
- You ran over the penguin.
- You put a penguin in my spot!

56:49.659 --> 56:52.829
You ran over the penguin!
What are you talking about?

56:53.121 --> 56:54.497
Well, you don't have to yell at me.

56:54.789 --> 56:55.832
Can I get out?

56:56.124 --> 56:57.625
Stay in the car, Billy.

56:58.501 --> 57:00.003
And watch this.

57:01.338 --> 57:03.173
You can't... Look, buddy.
You're not going anywhere.

57:03.214 --> 57:04.966
You're fixing the thing.
That's all I'm telling you.

57:05.008 --> 57:06.343
I'm going to eat.

57:06.551 --> 57:07.886
You're not going anywhere.

57:08.136 --> 57:10.805
- Watch out for the penguin, sir!
- No, I see it.

57:10.847 --> 57:12.182
You already hit the penguin.

57:12.515 --> 57:15.352
Listen to me, you're going
to fix that penguin, bro.

57:16.519 --> 57:18.980
Whether you like it or not,
believe me, you're gonna fix it.

57:19.022 --> 57:20.023
Nope.

57:22.025 --> 57:24.861
I mean, if I was fixing it,
you'd see me fixing it, but...

57:26.029 --> 57:27.572
I'm not fixing it.

57:36.873 --> 57:38.833
Did you notice how I
wasn't fixing it?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.419
- I'm about to bust your ass.
- Over a penguin?

57:47.050 --> 57:49.177
Fucking leave the
penguin alone, bro.

57:52.889 --> 57:56.393
I'm about to whip you, motherfucker.
Up your ass, bro.

58:01.523 --> 58:04.025
That looks like
the camel toe in your pants!

58:06.569 --> 58:09.030
Get it? I said you had a vagina.

58:09.072 --> 58:10.740
That's a vagina reference.

58:11.408 --> 58:13.743
You're gonna fix this fucking
penguin, whether you like it or not.

58:13.785 --> 58:15.412
- You understand?
- One second. I'm gonna say it...

58:15.453 --> 58:16.871
Am not, am not!

58:17.080 --> 58:19.082
- You're gonna fix this fucking thing.
- Nope, nope.

58:19.207 --> 58:22.043
You gotta ask yourself,
"What leverage do I have?"

58:23.420 --> 58:24.754
Not much!

58:24.921 --> 58:27.590
You're a fucking jerkoff,
you know that?

58:29.592 --> 58:32.095
- "You're gonna fix that penguin!"
- "No, you're gonna fix it!"

58:32.137 --> 58:34.472
- "You're gonna fix it!"
- "No, you're gonna!"

58:35.765 --> 58:38.476
- Table for two?
- Yeah.

58:38.727 --> 58:40.103
Okay. Right this way.

58:40.228 --> 58:42.230
I'd like to fix her penguin.

58:42.439 --> 58:44.899
Want to see how red
I can get my face?

58:45.108 --> 58:46.735
Yeah.

58:53.116 --> 58:54.951
Stop, stop, stop!

58:56.286 --> 58:59.956
Oh, my God.
That was redder than an ape's ass.

59:02.125 --> 59:04.294
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

59:04.627 --> 59:06.463
That was redder than
an ape's <i>tuchas.</i>

59:11.593 --> 59:13.303
Do you like a lot of milk?

59:13.636 --> 59:15.472
Oh, boy, do I!

59:17.140 --> 59:19.476
I like chocolate milk sometimes.

59:19.809 --> 59:21.644
Yeah,
Grandpa's got a taste for that, too.

59:21.686 --> 59:22.687
Yeah.

59:22.979 --> 59:25.273
He used to have a big taste for it.

59:26.483 --> 59:28.318
Why doesn't my mom like me?

59:31.821 --> 59:33.323
Your mom likes you, buddy.

59:33.990 --> 59:36.159
Then why'd she run away from me?

59:36.493 --> 59:37.494
Well...

59:39.162 --> 59:41.831
Mom's got to go away
for a little bit,

59:41.873 --> 59:46.336
and so I'm taking you to your dad
so he can look after you.

59:49.005 --> 59:51.132
But I don't really like my dad.

59:52.676 --> 59:54.844
Yeah, I don't like him much either,
buddy.

59:59.182 --> 01:00:04.020
I think all this bacon
is getting to Grandpa.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.744
Did you just toot, Grandpa?

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:21.663
That was a church house creeper.

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:23.039
I think I got one.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:29.295
I think you need to
clean out your shorts.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:33.717
Beat that.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:36.052
Grandpa's tummy's hurting.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:37.721
Let it out.

01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:42.726
Try this one on for size.

01:00:51.609 --> 01:00:54.362
- Oh, God.
- Grandpa, you sharted!

01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:56.698
I'm so sorry.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.741
Are you okay?

01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:58.992
Oh, my...

01:01:00.076 --> 01:01:01.244
Oh, my God.

01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:04.914
I'm sorry, ladies.
Don't look back there. I'm so sorry.

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.543
Oh, God, that's...

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:15.091
Let's go, buddy.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.760
Oh, no.

01:01:20.096 --> 01:01:24.392
That guy stood up on the chair part
and pooped on the wall.

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:26.269
- He what?
- And he pooped on the wall.

01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:37.113
Good shot. Good...
Take it again. Take it again.

01:01:39.616 --> 01:01:40.950
Jesus.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:46.289
All right. You want some of this?

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:49.125
Why can't I just stay with you
instead of my dad?

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:52.587
- 'Cause that's not the plan.
- We can change the plan.

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:06.309
How about this? If I make this shot,
I get to stay with you instead of my dad.

01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:07.352
All right.

01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:11.147
Get that out of here!

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:20.115
How about we become tuna fishermen
and then move to Japan?

01:02:20.323 --> 01:02:21.825
Oh, boy.

01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:28.206
We'll get a fish market and then
we sell all tuna and we'll be billionaires.

01:02:28.498 --> 01:02:31.626
There is lots of tuna in
Japan, that's for sure!

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.505
That's the best idea
I heard in years, son.

01:02:39.175 --> 01:02:41.344
Do you like to fish, old man?

01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:45.849
I used to like to fish a lot,
but that was before.

01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:47.684
Before what?

01:02:50.186 --> 01:02:55.191
Before a dark day
when I caught my very own Moby Dick.

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.034
Jesus!

01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:11.875
Shit!

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.711
Oh, Lordy! Lordy!

01:03:21.217 --> 01:03:22.552
A little help!

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:26.598
Man!

01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:30.727
Check out the nine iron on this one.

01:03:32.062 --> 01:03:33.063
Oh, God.

01:03:33.229 --> 01:03:34.564
Shit.

01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:37.567
What is that? What is that?

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:42.072
- It's a large-nose carpet croaker!
- Yeah. Okay.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.499
He's got his dick in his mouth!

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:58.421
After that,
I never ate fish sticks again.

01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:02.926
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:06.221
You know what?
I may have a solution.

01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:17.941
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Of course it is.

01:04:17.982 --> 01:04:21.277
You can get away with most anything,
all you got to do is try.

01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:23.113
Follow my lead.

01:04:31.454 --> 01:04:34.249
Okay, folks, can we get a
picture here with everyone?

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:37.460
Can everybody back up
on this side just a little bit?

01:04:37.585 --> 01:04:39.295
Just kinda take a couple steps back.

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:43.299
Keep going, just a little bit more.

01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:46.302
Look at this.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.972
This is lovely!

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.354
- Look at that. It's pretty, right?
- Yeah.

01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.189
Sir, can you back up out of the way?

01:04:58.314 --> 01:05:00.025
I'm trying to take a picture.

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:11.870
- Help him!
- Are you okay, Grandpa?

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:21.254
Oh, my God!

01:05:22.672 --> 01:05:24.132
Should we call 911?

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:25.800
Who pushed me?

01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:28.011
I don't know. I think you just fell.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:47.030
Here. Got you some breakfast.

01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:48.698
Sweet!

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.241
All right.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.711
- What's today?
- Saturday.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.340
Bet we could've
stirred up some trouble here.

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:09.844
Damn shame I got to
drop you at your dad's tomorrow.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:13.014
The hell with it!
Let's go have some fun.

01:06:18.395 --> 01:06:20.563
Would you like to
see a magic trick?

01:06:20.855 --> 01:06:23.566
I need a $20 bill as a prop.

01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:25.360
And I'll give it right back to you.

01:06:29.572 --> 01:06:32.242
Grab the stuff...
Let's beat it, kid!

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.202
Come on! Come on!

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:36.746
What are you doing?
What are you waiting on? Come on!

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:40.083
Grandpa, the car!

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:48.091
Have a sip of beer with Grandpa.

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.890
'Cause he should not be drinking.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:58.268
Grandpa, I'm fucking wasted.

01:07:02.772 --> 01:07:04.482
What the hell was that?

01:07:07.944 --> 01:07:09.904
You little cooter stretcher!

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:11.114
No!

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.199
Wedgie, wedgie!

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.459
What's on your shirt?

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:27.464
Damn it.

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:32.093
Okay, my little wingman,
why don't you take the big bed tonight?

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.803
- You deserve it.
- Thank you, Grandpa!

01:07:36.973 --> 01:07:39.851
Settle down, now.
We got to get some sleep.

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:41.770
We got Raleigh tomorrow.

01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:44.481
Night, Billy.

01:07:44.814 --> 01:07:48.818
- Grandpa, can we go fishing tomorrow?
- Maybe.

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.320
Promise?

01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:53.948
Sure, I promise maybe.

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:58.161
I think I hear a flock of geese!

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.833
Oh, my God,
I think I just shit myself.

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:11.007
Good night, buddy.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.703
I don't want to go
to my dad, though.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.497
Well, I...

01:08:42.538 --> 01:08:47.002
You got to. I can't keep you.

01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:51.214
I just can't
do anything with you right now.

01:08:53.049 --> 01:08:57.220
But I'm sure your father
will do the right thing.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.182
My son's grandfather
is dropping him off.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:03.393
I ain't seen the boy
in three or four years.

01:09:03.518 --> 01:09:04.894
- So, you know... Yeah.
- Really?

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.063
She took him away from me, okay,

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:09.441
'cause so she could get, you know,
whatever, 'cause she got mad at me.

01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:11.734
Child support.
Child support'll kill you.

01:09:11.776 --> 01:09:14.279
Guess what?
Now I'm getting the child support.

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:16.865
You got any speed?

01:09:24.038 --> 01:09:25.707
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Hey, man.

01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:27.625
- I'm Chuck.
- I'm Patrick.

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:28.752
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.545
Hey, what's that...

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.130
- Oh, fuck, man.
- What's that, man?

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.256
What's up with the "GOC"?
What's that, man?

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:35.884
Guardians of the Children, man.

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:40.805
That's what G.O.C. stands for.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.768
No shit. Well, what does that mean?

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:46.895
We're a...

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:48.897
biker organization...

01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.439
Organization, huh?

01:09:50.982 --> 01:09:53.359
and we, we help abused kids, man.

01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:54.944
Come on.

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:06.081
There's the old prick right now.

01:10:06.623 --> 01:10:08.124
It's about time.

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:10.168
You get lost?

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.128
Hey, Chuck.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.588
Irving.

01:10:13.963 --> 01:10:18.134
Hey, buddy. How you doing, billy goat?
You want to give me a hug?

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:21.262
- Don't be afraid of me.
- Hey.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:24.140
I know
we had our differences in the past,

01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:29.145
but I'm gonna ask you right now
to please take care of this boy.

01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:30.438
He's all I have left.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:34.234
Don't come at me
like I'm some kind of asshole.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.652
Of course I'm gonna take
care of the little shit.

01:10:35.735 --> 01:10:37.404
- He's my kid.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:39.030
Just take it down, all right?

01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:43.827
Just surprise me
and don't be a schmuck this time, okay?

01:10:44.828 --> 01:10:45.912
We're all good.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:48.164
Come here. Come here, buddy.

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:53.628
You be a good boy, okay? All right?

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.340
I'm going to be checking
in on you a lot.

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:02.178
And I'm gonna get word to your mom
that you're with your father now.

01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:06.182
And I'm gonna tell her
all the fun we had,

01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:08.518
and all the cool
things you showed me.

01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:11.688
Grandpa loves you very much.

01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:13.648
Love you, too.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.360
Good-bye, son.

01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:19.154
Bye, old man.

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:26.161
Come on, Billy.

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.163
That's enough of that horseshit.

01:11:28.538 --> 01:11:31.041
- Hop up here. There you go.
- Get up here, little man.

01:11:31.207 --> 01:11:32.375
Excuse me.

01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:35.712
Just sit up here.

01:11:35.795 --> 01:11:38.798
Here, take this bag off.
You don't need this.

01:11:51.728 --> 01:11:52.729
How ya doing?

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:53.772
Yes, sir.

01:11:53.855 --> 01:11:55.607
We're the Guardians
of the Children...

01:11:55.982 --> 01:11:57.359
and we take care of kids...

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.401
That's good.

01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:00.820
and as long as this boy and
this feller's in there...

01:12:01.112 --> 01:12:03.073
that child will be took care of.

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:04.616
Thank you very much. I...

01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:05.700
Don't worry about that.

01:12:05.742 --> 01:12:08.703
I'm his grandfather and unfortunately
I have to hand him back now.

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:10.121
I can see the concern.

01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:13.500
I don't trust him.

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:16.211
How long does he get
to keep the child?

01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:18.088
Until his mom gets out of jail.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.423
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't talk about it.

01:12:20.882 --> 01:12:22.759
I understand. Have a good day.

01:12:22.842 --> 01:12:24.177
Please watch him!

01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:25.929
We'll take good care of him.

01:12:41.027 --> 01:12:42.278
What's your name, little feller?

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:44.280
What's your name?

01:12:44.531 --> 01:12:45.699
Billy.

01:12:45.907 --> 01:12:47.283
Billy, I'm Rick.

01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:48.326
Hi, Rick.

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:49.661
Nice to meet you, Billy.

01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:51.538
Dad, can we get some food?

01:12:51.621 --> 01:12:53.748
I'll tell you what,
you can have a water.

01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:56.668
Do you want a chicken wing
for the road?

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.295
Please, Dad, I'm hungry.

01:13:00.213 --> 01:13:01.881
You don't need to eat that.
You're...

01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:04.968
No, don't give him that.

01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:07.387
I mean, he needs to lose some weight.
I mean, honestly.

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:08.972
A chicken leg ain't gonna hurt him.

01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:10.015
Thank you.

01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:15.979
Will you watch the little fat boy?
I gotta go take a piss.

01:13:16.062 --> 01:13:17.147
Don't call him that.

01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:23.963
You got kids?

01:14:24.714 --> 01:14:27.592
- Do they eat like that?
- Yes, they do.

01:14:31.429 --> 01:14:32.430
Billy.

01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:34.849
Let's go fishing.

01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.394
Let's go fishing, buddy.

01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:39.688
What are you doing back here?

01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:41.064
- He's going with me.
- Can we?

01:14:41.356 --> 01:14:42.982
Yeah, you're coming with me.

01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:44.693
Yeah, I don't want you with him,
all right?

01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:46.403
No, no. Don't put your hands on him.

01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:48.947
That's my son.
I can put my hand on him if I want to.

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:50.532
No, don't touch him. You are his...

01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:51.783
- You are a son of a bitch.
- I am his family.

01:14:51.908 --> 01:14:53.076
You've been no father.

01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:54.619
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:54.703 --> 01:14:55.954
Come on, Billy. Let's go.

01:14:56.037 --> 01:14:57.414
Just stay right there!
Don't listen...

01:14:57.497 --> 01:14:59.165
Hey, he's staying right here.

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:01.084
- Come here, buddy.
- No, no, no. He's staying here.

01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:02.377
- Back off!
- You back off!

01:15:02.419 --> 01:15:04.921
He's not going with you.
He's coming with me.

01:15:05.255 --> 01:15:07.215
- Do you understand?
- No, no, no.

01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:08.967
- He's coming with...
- This is my meal ticket.

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.635
You're not fit to have him.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.303
- I'm not fit?
- Yeah, you're not fit...

01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:14.389
I'm not fit?
I'll fucking kick your ass!

01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:16.141
- Get out of my face!
- All right, all right!

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:21.104
- I'll kill you!
- Easy. Easy.

01:15:21.146 --> 01:15:22.647
Settle the hell down, man!

01:15:23.106 --> 01:15:24.399
You ain't going nowhere, buddy.
Stop it.

01:15:24.441 --> 01:15:26.276
You better let go of me, boy.

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.153
- Let me get his bag.
- Take your grandson.

01:15:28.236 --> 01:15:30.613
- Where's my grandson's backpack?
- Okay. He's okay.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.282
I can't hack it with him!

01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:34.951
There goes my 600 bucks!

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.453
What are you talking about, man?

01:15:36.494 --> 01:15:39.164
That kid is my 600 bucks a month!

01:15:39.289 --> 01:15:40.623
Come back here!

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:43.209
Let me tell you something,
he's more than money.

01:15:43.293 --> 01:15:44.794
He's a hell of a lot
more than money.

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:45.879
You hear what I'm saying?

01:15:45.962 --> 01:15:47.797
- He's fixing to get hurt out there.
- I hear you, man.

01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:49.174
You'll freaking get hurt, brother.

01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:50.633
You ain't gonna kill
nobody, brother.

01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:52.969
Unless you die your damn self
then you better chill out.

01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:54.304
All right, now, all right!

01:15:54.346 --> 01:15:56.181
You looking at a death
angel right now.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.141
Go ahead and take off.
We'll keep him inside.

01:15:58.266 --> 01:15:59.476
Thank you so much.

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:02.103
Bye, baby! Have fun, okay?

01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:05.148
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

01:16:06.524 --> 01:16:07.525
I'm okay.

01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.198
Oh, no.

01:16:13.281 --> 01:16:15.283
Oh, shit!

01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:17.660
Sorry about the bikes!

01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:26.878
Did you really think
I was going to leave you?

01:16:26.961 --> 01:16:27.962
Kind of.

01:16:28.004 --> 01:16:29.506
No way!

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:33.718
Well, what do you want to do now?

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.804
I got an idea.

01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:42.018
Hey, guys.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:43.103
- Good evening.
- Hi.

01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:44.771
- How are you?
- Good.

01:16:47.857 --> 01:16:49.150
- All right...
- Wait.

01:16:49.859 --> 01:16:54.823
Now, when we walk in that room,
your name is Lindsey Dill. Okay?

01:16:54.864 --> 01:16:58.868
You're a pretty little girl, so no
farting and no swearing, you got it?

01:16:59.369 --> 01:17:01.663
Let's go win us some money.

01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:03.164
All right. Come on.

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:10.046
Hi. Is it okay if I
interview you guys?

01:17:10.171 --> 01:17:11.715
Doing a behind-the-scenes
video for the pageant.

01:17:11.756 --> 01:17:12.757
Sure.

01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:15.385
Who are you?

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.761
Hi. My name's Jill.

01:17:16.886 --> 01:17:18.179
Can I ask you some questions
for our camera?

01:17:18.221 --> 01:17:19.222
Yes.

01:17:19.305 --> 01:17:20.432
Say, "Yes, ma'am"
but don't baby-talk.

01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:22.350
So, how many pageants
have you been in?

01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:25.061
I've probably been in
a thousand pageants.

01:17:25.186 --> 01:17:27.230
And how many of them did you win?

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:30.066
I won every single one!

01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:32.402
- What?
- Every single one!

01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:35.113
- I'm supposed to talk.
- It's competitive, it's a sport.

01:17:35.196 --> 01:17:37.532
- And my friends...
- And so moms get...

01:17:37.574 --> 01:17:38.783
You know, they get
into this competition

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:40.118
and if you're going to do it
and do it right...

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:41.286
What are you doing?

01:17:41.369 --> 01:17:43.788
Stop, now. If you're going
to do it and do it right...

01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:46.458
I mean, you've got to be
willing to be competitive.

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:47.625
And that's what happens, you know?

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:49.753
Sometimes I think competition,
just like any other sport,

01:17:49.794 --> 01:17:51.629
gets the best of everybody.

01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:53.298
<i>Well, thank you so much
for being here tonight</i>

01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:56.092
<i>at the Carolina Cutie Pies
Young Miss Pageant.</i>

01:17:56.217 --> 01:17:58.595
<i>And because
this is such a special night,</i>

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.430
<i>we have a very special
surprise for you.</i>

01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:06.436
<i>Tonight, for the winner,
we're going to give away $5,000!</i>

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:11.441
<i>$5,000!</i>

01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:14.611
That's crazy!

01:18:19.115 --> 01:18:24.412
<i>But now, we want to get into
our beauty gown competition.</i>

01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:25.705
<i>Are you excited?</i>

01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:27.791
<i>I know. I love it!</i>

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:29.918
This is so funny!

01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:31.961
<i>Contestant number one,
please come to the stage.</i>

01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:36.800
<i>Looking very beautiful tonight.</i>

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:57.987
<i>This is contestant number 10,
Lindsey Dill!</i>

01:18:58.488 --> 01:19:03.326
<i>Lindsey has blazing blonde hair
and hazel eyes.</i>

01:19:03.618 --> 01:19:08.998
<i>Her hobbies are football, fishing
and playing with her sock monkey!</i>

01:19:09.332 --> 01:19:11.501
<i>That must be your proud grandpa.</i>

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:23.138
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
contestant number 10, Lindsey Dill.</i>

01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:29.519
That's my granddaughter.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:50.957
<i>Let's give her a hand!</i>

01:19:52.834 --> 01:19:56.546
Your daughter's so precious.
She's so precious... She did really good.

01:19:57.464 --> 01:20:01.217
I don't know if it'll be good enough
for first place, but she did really good.

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.012
...Good Time <i>
by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen.</i>

01:20:05.472 --> 01:20:07.390
So, how do you think
the competition's going so far?

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:08.475
Good.

01:20:08.558 --> 01:20:10.727
Do you think you have
any stiff competition?

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:12.145
Some...

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:15.523
one of these girls has
her grandpa here.

01:20:16.232 --> 01:20:17.400
Is that weird?

01:20:17.525 --> 01:20:19.569
We've just never seen it,
so it's different.

01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:22.405
<i>And this is contestant number 10.</i>

01:20:22.739 --> 01:20:24.908
<i>Everyone, Lindsey Dill!</i>

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:36.086
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:40.590
<i>My Bonnie lies over the sea</i>

01:20:40.882 --> 01:20:44.928
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

01:20:45.387 --> 01:20:49.057
<i>Please bring back my Bonnie to me</i>

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:16.501
We're locking it up.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.961
Come on.

01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:02.881
That's a boy?

01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:05.133
Shit. Come on!

01:22:05.842 --> 01:22:08.970
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for Lindsey Dill.</i>

01:22:22.984 --> 01:22:24.986
Grandpa,
what'd you think of my dancing?

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.655
I loved your dancing.

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:32.410
You were Ginger Rogers and Fred
Astaire all rolled into one.

01:22:32.744 --> 01:22:33.912
Gimme five.

01:22:36.664 --> 01:22:39.584
Grandpa, school starts on Tuesday.

01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:41.127
Tuesday?

01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:43.838
Hell, that's when
the ponies start running.

01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:47.342
What do you say
I get you to school on Friday?

01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.677
All right!

01:23:02.857 --> 01:23:03.858
All right.

01:23:08.697 --> 01:23:10.573
Does this look like a good spot?

01:23:10.782 --> 01:23:12.951
This looks like as
good a spot as any.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:20.458
Here we go!

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:25.213
Oh, my goodness!

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:27.549
Thanks, buddy.

01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:38.226
- You sure we should do this?
- This is what she wanted.

01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:42.063
You got any final words
for your grandma?

01:23:42.397 --> 01:23:43.565
Yeah.

01:23:44.399 --> 01:23:45.900
Bye, Grandma.

01:23:46.735 --> 01:23:48.069
Bye, Ellie.

01:23:59.914 --> 01:24:01.249
Let's start fishing.

01:24:01.374 --> 01:24:02.751
Let's fish.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:04.669
I call black one!

01:24:04.919 --> 01:24:07.589
You got the black one?
Okay, I got the red one.

01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:12.927
- Grandpa, I got to pee-pee.
- You got to pee-pee?

01:24:13.261 --> 01:24:16.765
Well, dangle that little thing
through the railing and let her rip.

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:20.185
But point it that way
out of respect for your grandmother.

01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:47.671
Man, get the fuck away from me.

01:24:47.712 --> 01:24:48.880
What did I do?

01:24:48.963 --> 01:24:53.051
- Can I get a hug? Dad?
- That wouldn't be appropriate, big guy.

01:24:56.137 --> 01:24:58.848
- He says you have a fat kitty cat.
- Okay.

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:01.726
- Jiggle my shoulders!
- I tried to do it!

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.479
Jiggle my... Jiggle! Jiggle!

01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:05.897
What does he look like?

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:12.153
He's got a moustache, big head,
tall, and he smells like old farts.

01:25:13.905 --> 01:25:15.407
Listen, old man.
I ain't fucking young.

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.827
I'm 45 years old.
I'll fucking tune you up. All right?

01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:20.912
Yep.

01:25:20.995 --> 01:25:23.415
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Listen up, listen up!

01:25:23.498 --> 01:25:25.709
The gentleman you just saw in here
was Mr. Johnny Knoxville

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.211
and we are shooting a movie.

01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:36.678
<i>Thank you, everyone,
for putting up with me tonight,</i>

01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:38.430
<i>and thank you for not beating me up.</i>

01:25:38.513 --> 01:25:39.931
- High five!<i>
- High five!</i>

01:25:40.015 --> 01:25:42.017
Why were you wearing a bra?

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.685
"Why were you wearing a bra?"

01:25:43.727 --> 01:25:45.228
For my dance.

01:25:46.438 --> 01:25:48.356
Well, that was inappropriate!

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.983
Doris, what did you think?

01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:53.028
My mother's not gonna like this!

01:25:54.362 --> 01:25:57.282
- We're shooting a movie.
- No way!

01:25:57.365 --> 01:26:00.243
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Oh, my God!

01:26:00.326 --> 01:26:03.329
I just did all of that and...
Oh, my God!

01:26:03.538 --> 01:26:06.207
And a rusty trombone for my grandpa.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.377
- A rusty trombone for your grandpa?
- Yep.

01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:13.465
Well, I need to take your picture to see
if you're on a milk carton somewhere.

01:26:13.548 --> 01:26:15.050
What do you think?

01:26:15.633 --> 01:26:16.801
Don't hurt me!

01:26:16.885 --> 01:26:18.887
Hurt you? I'm 86 years old.

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:19.971
Don't hurt me!

01:26:25.393 --> 01:26:27.228
Billy! Billy!

01:26:37.739 --> 01:26:39.240
What is a whore?

01:26:39.574 --> 01:26:41.618
Oh, boy.

01:26:42.911 --> 01:26:45.080
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

01:26:46.414 --> 01:26:48.750
All right, here we go.

01:26:58.593 --> 01:27:00.929
I'm an old prick now.

01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:04.766
Yeah? Get a load of this!

01:27:10.271 --> 01:27:15.026
My mommy loves crack
almost as much as I love fishing.

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.278
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.413
Can I help you?

01:27:26.788 --> 01:27:28.957
Talk more like an old man.

01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:31.001
- Me?
- Yes.

01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:35.046
Yeah, he sounds like
Johnny Knoxville.

01:27:38.466 --> 01:27:42.345
I hate this job.
I fucking hate you!

01:27:43.638 --> 01:27:47.475
This is a camera, in there.

01:27:47.726 --> 01:27:49.185
That's a camera.

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.479
I think there's a camera
here somewhere.

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.863
- Talk to that.
- Okay, and when... Hi, how are you?

01:27:59.946 --> 01:28:02.449
Look at me! I look beautiful!

01:28:04.826 --> 01:28:06.494
That's one ugly bitch.

01:28:07.746 --> 01:28:09.456
It's interesting.
Every time I work with these guys,

01:28:09.539 --> 01:28:11.666
I'm either in a casket
or around a casket.

01:28:23.928 --> 01:28:25.597
I like standing here.

01:28:27.182 --> 01:28:28.850
And I like standing here.

01:28:29.184 --> 01:28:31.853
But my favorite spot is here.

01:28:32.187 --> 01:28:33.355
- Come on.
- Get away.

01:28:33.605 --> 01:28:38.401
I may be too old to stir the gumbo, but I
can still lick the ladle, that's for sure.

01:28:38.485 --> 01:28:39.652
Oh, my God.

01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:43.365
In my opinion, ladle-licking is more
important than gumbo-stirring anyway.

01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:45.867
I can lick my eyebrows.

01:28:46.117 --> 01:28:47.118
Get out!

01:28:48.745 --> 01:28:49.746
Fuck.

01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:56.628
Oh, my God!

01:29:12.227 --> 01:29:13.561
Are you all right?

01:29:19.401 --> 01:29:21.611
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

01:29:34.082 --> 01:29:35.417
Big finish.

01:29:42.924 --> 01:29:44.467
What's going on here?

01:29:44.509 --> 01:29:45.844
Get out of here, asshole.

01:29:46.094 --> 01:29:48.930
We have to bring in
your stunt double.

01:29:55.603 --> 01:29:57.480
- Thank you.
- You gotta be shittin' me, man!

01:29:57.522 --> 01:29:59.858
I'm sitting there looking,
I'm like, "What is up with this?"

01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:01.151
Are you serious?

01:30:01.192 --> 01:30:03.153
You guys are so sweet
to look after Billy.

01:30:03.194 --> 01:30:04.487
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?

01:30:12.787 --> 01:30:14.039
I'm sorry, Kelman.

01:30:22.297 --> 01:30:25.967
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:31.723
