of the clothing designs from the Chosun Dynasty.
<i>KO Soo</i>

01:42.231 --> 01:47.802

Congratulations on completing the
mourning and wearing the dragon robe.

03:43.686 --> 03:46.519
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

03:50.292 --> 03:51.850
Forget congratulations...

03:55.231 --> 03:58.723
Mr. Head Tailor, you
look quite rejuvenated.

03:59.168 --> 04:02.296
Have you secretly married
during our mourning period?

04:02.471 --> 04:04.439
Your Majesty, how could I...

04:04.640 --> 04:06.232
It's a joke.

04:24.093 --> 04:26.653
It's been 3 years already

04:26.962 --> 04:29.487
since my brother passed away.

04:32.521 --> 04:35.787
I have taken the throne
at your earnest requests.

04:39.909 --> 04:43.106
But my heart is still heavy.

04:46.262 --> 04:47.262
Your Majesty.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.630
To whom shall I bestow thy socks today?

04:52.955 --> 04:54.388
Of course.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.925
Grant it to the Prime Minister,
whom His late Majesty dearly trusted.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.967
I am eternally grateful,
Your Majesty.

05:14.110 --> 05:17.045
You all respected
the mourning period.

05:17.313 --> 05:20.180
I feel selfish to be the only one
with new clothes.

05:20.483 --> 05:23.748
I wish to bestow you all
with new robes.

05:23.886 --> 05:25.444
Mr. Head Tailor.

05:25.588 --> 05:27.647
Please put forth your best efforts.

05:27.723 --> 05:30.851
We are eternally grateful,
Your Majesty.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.089
Your Majesty.

05:33.529 --> 05:39.263
The people are deeply worried
that Your Majesty is without an heir.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.097
I implore you

05:41.303 --> 05:47.139
to dethrone the Queen and
wed a new queen.

05:50.146 --> 05:52.137
I almost forgot.

05:53.916 --> 05:54.916
Mr. Head Tailor.

05:55.050 --> 05:59.180
Don't forget to make a new dress
for the Queen.

06:00.856 --> 06:03.984
Make sure it's beautiful.

06:14.036 --> 06:17.494
Prepare for the
'end of the mourning' ceremony.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.006
Yes, Mr. Head Tailor.

<i>ROYAL TAILOR</i>

06:58.365 --> 06:59.365
Come here, boy.

07:01.684 --> 07:03.777
I said come here.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.885
Come here!

07:07.623 --> 07:09.614
Little bastard.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.124
Come here at once.

07:12.561 --> 07:14.051
Did you call, sir?

07:16.031 --> 07:17.328
What brings you here?

07:18.567 --> 07:21.798
You just said, 'Come here'...

07:22.071 --> 07:23.333
Sorry, sir...

07:27.076 --> 07:30.375
You'll soon be wearing it
when you become a nobleman.

07:30.479 --> 07:33.141
Congratulations in advance, sir.

07:33.215 --> 07:35.183
Forget congratulations.

07:41.323 --> 07:45.316
You look rejuvenated.

07:46.662 --> 07:48.653
Did you secretly get married overnight?

07:48.764 --> 07:50.129
Sir?

07:51.333 --> 07:53.301
It's a joke.

07:53.669 --> 07:54.669
Let's go.

07:56.639 --> 07:58.607
This is nice, isn't it?

07:58.741 --> 08:00.732
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Thank you.

08:04.813 --> 08:06.371
Good work today.

08:07.116 --> 08:10.608
His Majesty seems very pleased
with the new dragon robe.

08:12.154 --> 08:14.588
Mr. Head Tailor,
let me pour you one.

08:21.530 --> 08:22.398
Oh, good.

08:22.399 --> 08:23.564
Sorry we're late.

08:23.565 --> 08:24.565
Come in, girls.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.128
Come sit down.

08:27.733 --> 08:29.199
Hurry up and sit down.

08:31.273 --> 08:34.366
Please excuse me,
I have work to attend to.

08:34.576 --> 08:36.770
Let's just enjoy today.
I'm buying.

08:37.546 --> 08:39.480
I appreciate the gesture.

08:39.481 --> 08:41.607
Please excuse me.

08:46.455 --> 08:48.480
Sure knows how to kill the mood.

08:54.930 --> 08:57.728
I mean I get why
the late king kept him.

08:58.067 --> 09:04.233
Everyone else was replaced,
yet the Head Tailor keeps his job.

09:04.406 --> 09:05.606
What's the matter?

09:05.607 --> 09:08.743
Bitter that you share rank
with a commoner?

09:08.744 --> 09:10.211
He's a lowly seamster.

09:10.446 --> 09:12.414
One more year...

09:12.681 --> 09:15.445
And he'll be promoted
to sixth tier.

09:15.584 --> 09:16.778
That means...

09:16.919 --> 09:18.978
- he'll become a nobleman!
- Watch the hat!

09:19.788 --> 09:22.018
A real nobleman!

09:22.591 --> 09:25.321
It makes no sense.
He can't even read.

09:25.961 --> 09:29.294
We can't help it.
He is adored by the King.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.879
That's true, but...

09:32.267 --> 09:36.488
Let's eat.

09:36.489 --> 09:37.090
Oh, well. Let's just drink.

09:37.139 --> 09:39.300
- Pour us a drink.
- Please do.

09:41.105 --> 09:41.696
Oh, my sweetie.

09:41.810 --> 09:42.578
What the...

09:42.579 --> 09:45.113
This is fine imported clothing!

09:45.114 --> 09:46.411
Sir Pan-soo.

09:47.116 --> 09:48.674
It's been a long time.

09:48.817 --> 09:50.216
This is...

09:50.653 --> 09:51.720
simply indecent!

09:52.043 --> 09:56.015
A woman's garment should
cover her decently.

09:56.725 --> 09:59.819
- That's why I like it here.
- There's dust on your hat.

10:12.087 --> 10:13.655
Is this also by the genius Kong-jin?

10:13.909 --> 10:14.909
Stop right there!

10:15.369 --> 10:16.369
Get him!

10:22.184 --> 10:23.208
Pardon me.

10:27.122 --> 10:28.350
Don't let him get away!

10:36.865 --> 10:39.459
Why did you do that?

10:41.103 --> 10:42.670
This underskirt...

10:42.671 --> 10:44.536
Can't untie it...

10:45.674 --> 10:47.198
What do you think?

10:47.342 --> 10:51.335
Their youngest daughter
wanted to wear my dress.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.775
Was it just because of
the dress?

10:56.518 --> 10:58.452
I heard rumors

10:58.654 --> 11:02.886
that you took the chastity of
Lord Park's only daughter.

11:02.991 --> 11:04.720
In the woods, no less.

11:05.327 --> 11:07.921
At this rate, there won't be
any virgins left.

11:07.963 --> 11:10.523
You'll have to seduce the Queen.

11:10.666 --> 11:11.894
The Queen?

11:12.032 --> 11:15.966
Why bother with an old hag?
Unless it's a young concubine.

11:16.672 --> 11:17.696
Old hag?

11:17.906 --> 11:20.602
She's barely 20 years of age.

11:21.495 --> 11:25.163
Besides, they say she's still a virgin.

11:25.781 --> 11:27.271
Truly?

11:27.483 --> 11:30.316
Then her face must be hopeless.

11:30.486 --> 11:31.817
People say...

11:32.087 --> 11:35.181
she's as fair as one of the
ancient beauties.

11:40.863 --> 11:41.921
Here.

11:42.297 --> 11:44.060
Payment for last night's damages.

11:56.011 --> 11:59.708
There's no law that says
women can't wear pants.

12:24.039 --> 12:25.939
Thank you.

12:26.041 --> 12:29.067
Please convey my thanks
to His Majesty.

12:30.145 --> 12:32.113
You're welcome, Your Highness.

12:32.781 --> 12:36.410
Did you bring what I asked for?

12:44.059 --> 12:47.392
The 'myunbok' looks worn out.

12:47.863 --> 12:50.161
I can mend it, Your Highness.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.734
His Majesty has bestowed new clothes.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.595
I must show my appreciation.

12:59.508 --> 13:02.443
You must be busy making clothes
for the cabinet.

13:02.544 --> 13:04.978
I will have my girls tend to this.

13:05.881 --> 13:07.508
Yes, Your Highness.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.642
Why did I put myself
in this situation again...

13:10.686 --> 13:14.247
Up, up. There we go.

13:18.026 --> 13:20.426
It's too early for a drink.

13:20.529 --> 13:23.498
Then what?
A dress for your mistress?

13:24.166 --> 13:26.532
Could you...
make me a new overcoat?

13:26.768 --> 13:29.635
And fix my new uniform as well.

13:29.771 --> 13:34.105
As you can see, I only make
the kind of clothes for these girls.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.732
I know!

13:36.612 --> 13:38.580
Do me a favor, will you?

13:39.147 --> 13:41.315
Can you, uh...

13:41.911 --> 13:43.087
Make it look different?

13:43.418 --> 13:43.884
What? 'Different'?

13:43.952 --> 13:44.316
What? 'Different'?

13:44.386 --> 13:44.875
Different.

13:44.953 --> 13:45.953
Different.

13:45.954 --> 13:46.954
That's right!

13:46.989 --> 13:48.320
Different...

13:49.491 --> 13:49.957
Different!

13:50.425 --> 13:51.425
Yes, different.

13:55.797 --> 13:58.459
People have all different
height and build.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.328
Yet the official robe comes
in one size.

14:02.471 --> 14:04.200
Might as well wear grain sacks.

14:07.689 --> 14:09.931
Beauty requires pain and patience.

14:11.813 --> 14:16.079
Clothes should fit the person.
Not the other way around.

14:17.185 --> 14:20.321
Don't cut the sleeve!
Clothes should look dignified...

14:20.322 --> 14:21.322
I see!

14:23.091 --> 14:24.091
Oh.

14:24.226 --> 14:26.626
See? Better, right?

14:28.063 --> 14:30.463
Hm... a large head with
narrow shoulders.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.565
What?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.033
You have narrow shoulders.

14:37.939 --> 14:39.270
A 'push-up' pad.

14:39.808 --> 14:44.268
It pushes up a flat chest
like mountain peaks.

14:44.413 --> 14:45.880
Hence the name.

14:47.215 --> 14:51.515
Put these under your feet.
Will elevate you by 2 inches.

14:55.457 --> 14:57.584
Should call them 'elevator' shoes.

14:58.293 --> 14:59.760
What's that?

14:59.861 --> 15:02.022
It's a bracken leaf.

15:02.931 --> 15:07.994
Something so often stepped on
that resembles our lives.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.410
Oh, no!

15:56.985 --> 15:58.748
Punish me, Your Highness.

15:58.854 --> 16:00.651
Please punish us.

16:00.722 --> 16:02.917
None of you are to blame.

16:04.126 --> 16:09.120
It's all my fault for going
beyond my means.

16:11.099 --> 16:12.157
Mr. Head Tailor.

16:12.701 --> 16:16.159
Forgive me, your Highness.
I can't fix it by tomorrow...

16:16.271 --> 16:17.898
Even though I ask you so?

16:18.373 --> 16:20.102
Will you still refuse?

16:24.212 --> 16:25.338
I...

16:27.516 --> 16:30.485
I believe I have a remedy.

16:33.522 --> 16:34.522
You!

16:35.423 --> 16:37.914
Are you the one who fixed
my daughter's dress?

16:43.231 --> 16:44.994
It's absolutely unfitting.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.526
I can't believe what she's wearing!

16:50.372 --> 16:51.566
You're right.

16:58.013 --> 17:00.345
I always get confused.

17:01.216 --> 17:04.583
You call this a dress?

17:04.752 --> 17:08.086
You can see her underskirt.

17:08.190 --> 17:11.022
Now you can tell them apart.

17:11.259 --> 17:12.782
What did you say?

17:12.928 --> 17:16.489
A garment should reflect
the social status and rules.

17:16.598 --> 17:18.531
This cheap, tasteless garbage...

17:20.068 --> 17:21.592
Did you say cheap?

17:21.736 --> 17:22.736
Then what is it?

17:22.838 --> 17:26.773
Does this look refined and
dignified to you?

17:30.812 --> 17:34.942
Do you know who he is?
Watch who you're yelling at.

17:35.584 --> 17:37.814
Come with me to the palace.

17:37.919 --> 17:39.716
The Queen wants to see you.

17:39.855 --> 17:41.550
The Queen?

17:42.724 --> 17:44.089
Palace?

17:49.097 --> 17:51.395
Do you really think he can do it?

17:54.336 --> 17:55.826
Let's give him a chance.

17:59.741 --> 18:02.835
Make way for Her Highness.

18:28.136 --> 18:30.229
Is he the tailor you spoke of?

18:30.305 --> 18:31.897
Yes, Your Highness.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.100
This is the tailor Lee Kong-jin.

18:45.553 --> 18:48.113
Can you really do it?

18:48.290 --> 18:52.021
If you do,
I'll forever remember your name.

18:53.128 --> 18:54.493
I can, Your Highness.

18:55.764 --> 18:58.164
I can do it, Your Highness.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.527
Is that so?

18:59.668 --> 19:02.068
Then I will trust you to it.

19:02.203 --> 19:04.763
Your Highness, you can't just...

19:05.006 --> 19:08.874
Have the seamstresses help him.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.636
Yes, Your Highness.

19:13.782 --> 19:15.579
Well...

19:16.651 --> 19:21.588
Do you even know
what that man is saying?

19:21.790 --> 19:25.851
He hasn't even seen
His Majesty in person.

19:25.961 --> 19:30.557
Let alone violating the court laws,
one night is not enough.

19:30.732 --> 19:31.732
Who are you?

19:32.233 --> 19:33.564
How dare you...

19:33.702 --> 19:36.000
- Stop it.
- Let's all calm down.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.936
Don't worry, I'll manage.

19:41.142 --> 19:42.268
Right.

19:43.111 --> 19:45.477
Do you even know what
a 'myunbok' is?

19:50.719 --> 19:53.711
You do know what that is, right?

19:59.928 --> 20:01.054
A 'myunbok'...

20:02.263 --> 20:06.393
is the king's ceremonial robe
for ancestral rites.

20:06.534 --> 20:10.595
It is also worn during
celebrations and assemblies.

20:10.805 --> 20:14.138
It consists of the robe
and a crown.

20:14.242 --> 20:15.834
The robe is made of

20:15.877 --> 20:19.210
the outer layer, inner layer,
inner skirt, front strip, belt,

20:19.347 --> 20:21.838
waist strap, socks, and shoes.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.248
And lastly, a jade scepter.

20:24.386 --> 20:31.417
The outer robe shall be of thin silk,
black and blue with a bit of red.

20:31.526 --> 20:34.962
The shoulders must have dragons.
And on the back...

20:40.168 --> 20:41.328
Shall I go on?

20:47.509 --> 20:49.739
Shouldn't we stop him?

20:49.878 --> 20:51.470
Don't bother.

20:52.714 --> 20:54.181
We'll find out tomorrow.

21:29.451 --> 21:32.284
It doesn't feel like the one
I used to wear.

21:33.488 --> 21:38.619
Your clothes looked worn,
so I had it fixed.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.479
Please forgive me for not
obtaining your permission.

21:42.764 --> 21:44.061
No wonder.

21:46.801 --> 21:48.928
It fits me perfectly.

21:50.015 --> 21:51.748
It feels more comfortable.

21:52.674 --> 21:54.801
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

21:58.780 --> 22:00.247
Who is that man?

22:00.348 --> 22:02.077
I haven't seen him before.

22:02.851 --> 22:03.851
He is...

22:04.385 --> 22:05.080
I...

22:05.244 --> 22:09.600
He is said to be a talented
tailor, so I hired him.

22:10.057 --> 22:12.026
I had him fix your robe.

22:13.228 --> 22:14.456
You are indeed talented.

22:14.562 --> 22:15.562
Mr. Head Tailor.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.070
Have him fix my hunting outfit.

22:22.704 --> 22:24.137
Yes, Your Majesty.

22:25.540 --> 22:28.532
We are ready to begin
the ceremony.

22:28.676 --> 22:29.676
Alright.

22:31.446 --> 22:34.176
Let's get it over with.

22:35.150 --> 22:39.416
Make way for His Majesty.

22:40.155 --> 22:44.182
You pay a man with cash,
not this useless...

22:44.292 --> 22:47.887
His Majesty bestowed it.
You should feel honored.

22:47.929 --> 22:50.056
What am I? A bum?

22:50.431 --> 22:51.898
Careful.

22:54.402 --> 22:55.562
Are you crazy?

22:55.770 --> 22:58.637
How can you drop it?
It's mine now.

23:33.148 --> 23:34.615
I called you both here

23:34.842 --> 23:39.108
because I want to thank you
for your work.

23:40.048 --> 23:41.174
Please enjoy.

23:41.349 --> 23:42.873
Yes, Your Highness.

23:52.927 --> 23:54.918
How is the tea?

23:57.265 --> 23:58.960
The taste lingers...

23:59.244 --> 24:01.911
May I ask why you read 'The Art of War'?

24:04.604 --> 24:07.551
Have you read it?

24:08.343 --> 24:10.174
Forgive me.

24:10.478 --> 24:14.278
But those books are for men.

24:14.447 --> 24:18.041
Who says a woman should
only learn how to sew?

24:19.554 --> 24:21.613
Life itself is war.

24:22.457 --> 24:23.981
Mr. Head Tailor.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.615
Yes, Your Highness.

24:25.793 --> 24:27.488
Isn't that so?

24:27.695 --> 24:30.027
The book only mentions...

24:30.098 --> 24:33.226
I've read that
it is best to avoid wars.

24:33.326 --> 24:34.326
It is true.

24:35.037 --> 24:38.951
'The Art of War' says that
it is best not to fight.

24:39.073 --> 24:40.199
That's right.

24:40.256 --> 24:42.323
But reality differs from books.

24:43.144 --> 24:47.979
You try to stay out of a fight,
and people think you're stupid.

24:48.816 --> 24:50.751
Don't avoid shit cuz
you're scared, right?

24:50.752 --> 24:52.379
You're speaking to Her Highness.

24:53.322 --> 24:54.522
Mind your manners.

24:58.126 --> 24:59.126
You're right.

25:00.161 --> 25:03.392
Indeed you don't avoid shit
because you're afraid.

25:03.498 --> 25:04.658
Your Highness!

25:38.800 --> 25:40.961
Who gave you permission to write?

25:41.136 --> 25:44.071
Please forgive me, sir!

25:54.015 --> 25:56.074
You have good hands for sewing.

26:04.459 --> 26:07.292
What are you doing at this hour?

26:09.531 --> 26:12.091
I want to be the best like you,
Mr. Head Tailor.

26:32.454 --> 26:35.116
What's this country ever done for me?

26:35.223 --> 26:39.182
His Majesty personally asked you
for a hunting outfit.

26:39.361 --> 26:41.261
Others would kill for this chance.

26:41.463 --> 26:42.862
For another stupid sock?

26:43.131 --> 26:44.598
Hey.

26:44.699 --> 26:45.699
This is for you.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.497
It's from Her Highness.

26:48.003 --> 26:50.801
She said you should give it
to a maiden you like.

26:55.911 --> 26:56.935
Oh, my.

26:58.613 --> 27:00.342
This is a phoenix hairpin.

27:05.453 --> 27:08.047
Guess you have a girl you like.

27:10.158 --> 27:11.750
Try cross-stitching.

27:12.394 --> 27:13.759
Come here...

27:14.095 --> 27:15.289
I... Uh...

27:17.198 --> 27:18.927
Come this way.

27:20.468 --> 27:22.800
Sewing...

27:22.938 --> 27:25.634
is like binding
two worlds into one.

27:25.774 --> 27:28.299
Pour your soul
as you put the needle in,

27:28.330 --> 27:30.863
and tend with care as you pull it out.

27:33.081 --> 27:34.241
Do you understand?

27:34.439 --> 27:35.839
Yes, Mr. Head Tailor.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.258
We need your help.

27:45.727 --> 27:47.217
His Majesty's garments...

27:47.562 --> 27:50.656
must always be cut
from these patterns.

27:52.701 --> 27:57.570
All royal garments are made
according to rules and customs.

27:59.407 --> 28:02.638
I've served three kings so far.

28:02.777 --> 28:06.941
The only thing that changed
was the Queen's wig.

28:08.216 --> 28:11.379
Tradition that stands
the test of time.

28:11.553 --> 28:14.317
Such is the nature
of a royal garment.

28:14.522 --> 28:17.719
The hunting outfit must also...

28:17.792 --> 28:19.692
I want to make it like this.

28:23.698 --> 28:25.063
I would first

28:25.200 --> 28:27.168
cut the sleeves in half.

28:27.769 --> 28:32.797
The waist line should be
slim and fluid like mountain stream.

28:32.941 --> 28:34.670
The bottom should be wide

28:34.809 --> 28:38.404
to make it more comfortable
and more dignified.

28:39.147 --> 28:40.307
It will look fierce...

28:40.682 --> 28:44.277
I was wondering how he made
clothes without patterns.

28:44.352 --> 28:46.650
I see that he draws them first.

28:47.655 --> 28:49.122
OK. Let's begin.

28:50.258 --> 28:51.486
His Majesty's face.

28:51.893 --> 28:52.893
Yongsang?

28:53.461 --> 28:54.928
'Yong-ahn.'

28:55.030 --> 28:55.860
And His Majesty's hands?

28:55.964 --> 28:56.555
Yongsoo.

28:56.664 --> 28:58.097
'Uh-soo.'

28:58.266 --> 29:00.097
His Majesty's feet?

29:00.201 --> 29:02.897
- Jokbal?
- How many times did I tell you?

29:03.004 --> 29:06.337
- What about His Majesty's penis?
- King's pen...

29:08.777 --> 29:10.472
Are you out of your mind?

29:10.612 --> 29:13.775
How dare you speak of His...

29:42.711 --> 29:43.871
Your Majesty!

29:49.318 --> 29:50.318
Your Majesty!

29:50.752 --> 29:52.913
Your Majesty!

29:57.092 --> 29:58.354
You Majesty!

29:58.460 --> 30:00.018
Please punish us.

30:13.909 --> 30:16.673
Don't make such a big deal.

30:17.245 --> 30:18.542
I'm fine.

30:19.314 --> 30:20.872
You may all stand up.

30:41.436 --> 30:42.835
Who's the girl?

30:45.741 --> 30:48.733
She's the daughter of
the Defense Chief.

31:00.188 --> 31:02.156
Have the girl come to the palace.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.095
Your blouse looks ravishing today.

31:12.768 --> 31:16.431
Isn't it the one popular now
in the Qing Empire?

31:16.571 --> 31:18.664
What's the use?

31:18.840 --> 31:21.070
When youth is beauty.

31:21.109 --> 31:23.839
That's not always true.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.914
The Queen has not even been
touched by her husband.

31:30.752 --> 31:32.652
Have you heard?

31:33.021 --> 31:37.151
His Majesty summoned
the Defense Chief's daughter.

31:37.359 --> 31:38.587
Is that true?

31:38.727 --> 31:40.456
Will the Queen be...

31:40.595 --> 31:45.658
Watch what you say.
She is still the Queen.

31:46.168 --> 31:47.897
Even if it's only a title.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.203
Your Highness.

31:50.372 --> 31:51.999
Shall I take a different path?

32:05.687 --> 32:07.279
My goodness.

32:07.556 --> 32:10.491
Your hands are so rough.
What do you do?

32:13.962 --> 32:17.989
This hand held a sword
for His Majesty.

32:18.166 --> 32:23.433
That hand sewed His Majesty's
clothes for a lifetime.

32:23.605 --> 32:26.233
Isn't it beautiful?

32:35.951 --> 32:39.546
Heard you'll become a nobleman
in a few months.

32:39.788 --> 32:42.552
I guess a person's birth
is not relevant.

32:42.758 --> 32:46.854
His Majesty himself was born
from a female servant.

32:47.496 --> 32:49.327
Isn't that so?

32:49.464 --> 32:51.091
As you know,

32:51.520 --> 32:53.976
The Defense Chief's daughter

32:54.503 --> 32:57.631
will receive His royal favor.

32:57.706 --> 33:01.733
Could you make a dress
for her ceremony?

33:04.112 --> 33:07.570
Forgive me, sir.

33:07.749 --> 33:11.549
I only make clothes for
His Majesty and Her Highness.

33:11.653 --> 33:14.679
Watch who you're speaking to.

33:14.823 --> 33:20.193
His daughter could very well be
the next queen.

33:20.495 --> 33:21.985
Who knows?

33:32.607 --> 33:36.543
How dare you spill liquor
on this expensive robe.

33:38.471 --> 33:39.471
Sir, please.

33:39.641 --> 33:40.641
Let go.

33:42.350 --> 33:45.342
I will pay for it.
Please forgive her.

33:48.557 --> 33:50.957
You could all go out and
whore yourselves.

33:51.094 --> 33:52.547
It still won't be enough.

33:52.627 --> 33:54.925
Sir, you're going too far.

33:55.063 --> 33:56.394
How dare you!

34:03.338 --> 34:04.600
What the hell?

34:05.240 --> 34:06.639
Don't worry, I'm here.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.777
How dare you filthy commoner
get in the way of a nobleman?

34:13.581 --> 34:15.049
What? Commoner?

34:15.817 --> 34:17.784
You bastards picked on the wrong man.

34:17.918 --> 34:19.079
'Bastards'?

34:19.621 --> 34:20.621
Hey!

34:23.859 --> 34:25.121
Over here!

34:28.572 --> 34:29.572
Hey.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.120
Hold on. Wait.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.773
- Just a second.
- What is this...

34:33.835 --> 34:35.324
What are you doing?

34:36.061 --> 34:37.541
Would you just...

34:39.386 --> 34:40.386
You guys.

34:40.675 --> 34:42.540
Do you know who he is?

34:42.643 --> 34:46.444
- He's the head of Sanguiwon.
- What are you doing?

34:46.514 --> 34:47.708
Sanguiwon?

34:47.849 --> 34:49.476
Don't be shy.

34:49.551 --> 34:53.783
A man sewing. How pathetic.

34:54.755 --> 34:56.690
He's the King's royal tailor.

34:59.661 --> 35:03.825
Fine. I'll let you two go.

35:03.999 --> 35:04.863
However.

35:04.933 --> 35:07.299
That bitch, who ruined
my precious clothes.

35:07.535 --> 35:08.968
I can't forgive.

35:09.104 --> 35:12.801
Will you sell yourself
to repay me?

35:12.874 --> 35:13.932
Or else...

35:14.743 --> 35:16.540
Will you spend the night with me?

35:16.711 --> 35:17.871
Ridiculous.

35:17.979 --> 35:21.915
Spend the night with you?
For such a dull robe?

35:21.983 --> 35:24.577
- I'll make it for you.
- How dare you!

35:25.001 --> 35:30.013
This robe is from a famous silk
shop in the Qing Empire...

35:30.306 --> 35:36.968
The Daemyungdang, of course.
With their finest silk, Chohageum.

35:38.033 --> 35:44.063
Chohageum is top quality silk
offered to the Chinese king.

35:44.205 --> 35:50.974
Did you know 'cho' in Chohageum
stands for Chosun?

35:52.480 --> 35:53.913
Of course.

35:55.183 --> 35:57.708
You think I wouldn't know?

35:58.286 --> 35:59.776
But unfortunately...

36:01.556 --> 36:03.956
The design is identical,
but the color...

36:05.593 --> 36:07.993
It looks like an ordinary silk.

36:08.630 --> 36:11.292
I believe you were
taken advantage of.

36:11.399 --> 36:12.661
- What?
- Preposterous...

36:12.767 --> 36:14.234
It's a fake?

36:16.504 --> 36:18.028
- A fake?
- What...

36:18.173 --> 36:21.142
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:21.276 --> 36:25.838
I've been a tailor
at the royal court for 30 years.

36:26.982 --> 36:28.813
You may bet on it.

36:29.323 --> 36:32.144
It was a fake? Let's just go.

36:32.854 --> 36:34.185
Hey. Hey!

36:34.589 --> 36:36.557
That felt good.

36:37.792 --> 36:38.925
Listen carefully.

36:39.053 --> 36:42.819
I don't care what
godforsaken parts you're from.

36:43.431 --> 36:44.864
But I'm the King's Tailor.

36:46.234 --> 36:47.496
Come on...

36:48.370 --> 36:50.338
I heard you'll become
a nobleman soon.

36:53.108 --> 36:56.202
You've made clothes for nobles
all these years.

36:56.311 --> 37:01.248
It'd feel so good to make
a dashing coat for yourself.

37:01.316 --> 37:02.806
Are you mocking me?

37:02.884 --> 37:04.249
Mocking you?

37:06.254 --> 37:08.017
Wait a minute.

37:08.523 --> 37:11.822
You have something in mind, huh?

37:12.961 --> 37:14.223
Did you already make it?

37:14.329 --> 37:15.329
Enough.

37:19.534 --> 37:23.402
I can't say I didn't think about it.

37:23.538 --> 37:25.062
I totally thought so.

37:26.841 --> 37:29.036
I'll use the finest jade-green silk.

37:29.144 --> 37:32.204
And make the sleeve stylishly large.

37:33.248 --> 37:37.344
I'd make the wrist narrow and
the bottom wide.

37:37.585 --> 37:41.180
The breast tie I would
embroider in gold.

37:41.256 --> 37:43.781
With a small bell on the waist.

37:43.858 --> 37:46.850
A bell's kind of tacky.
Maybe a jade ornament.

37:47.028 --> 37:48.188
It's my overcoat!

37:48.296 --> 37:50.662
Fine. Relax.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.972
See that moon way up there?

38:01.676 --> 38:03.644
Close your eyes for a second.

38:03.812 --> 38:05.040
Why should I?

38:05.246 --> 38:07.077
Just close them, will you?

38:10.652 --> 38:13.746
Imagine the moon floating above.

38:57.866 --> 39:02.894
On a topcoat yellow like the moon,
embroider the world's creations.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.944
With beautiful embroidery
beside the collar strip.

39:15.049 --> 39:17.279
And wear a large round hat

39:17.385 --> 39:19.979
with beads threaded on
a golden string.

39:24.692 --> 39:29.755
The inner layer will be red
like the blazing sun.

39:34.235 --> 39:36.066
And strut across the moon.

39:56.858 --> 40:02.626
The rabbits pounding the mortar
will regard you with envy.

40:02.764 --> 40:03.856
Wow!

40:04.165 --> 40:05.792
Let me know
when you become a nobleman.

40:06.701 --> 40:10.228
I'll make a killer coat for you.

40:28.523 --> 40:30.491
I need to measure your skirt.

40:30.792 --> 40:32.953
Please turn around.

40:33.528 --> 40:35.155
What did you say?

40:36.030 --> 40:37.725
Say that again.

40:52.146 --> 40:53.943
So you're the Head Tailor.

40:54.515 --> 40:55.812
Yes, ma'am.

40:55.950 --> 40:58.350
Make it as glamorous as you can.

41:00.154 --> 41:03.453
The ceremony will be as grand
as the Queen's.

41:05.159 --> 41:06.524
Yes, ma'am.

41:09.163 --> 41:11.893
Becoming a noble is not the end.

41:12.066 --> 41:15.695
You need to keep it up.

41:26.481 --> 41:27.971
Kong-jin.

41:28.784 --> 41:30.046
Kong-jin.

41:32.954 --> 41:36.219
I wish to thank His Majesty
for the new clothes.

41:36.925 --> 41:39.951
I was hoping you could make
something for him.

41:42.531 --> 41:43.930
Forgive me, Your Highness.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.657
But you should make it yourself.

41:46.768 --> 41:47.768
How dare you.

41:48.069 --> 41:49.696
It's Her Highness' request.

41:49.838 --> 41:51.806
It doesn't have to be
a full garment.

41:51.873 --> 41:55.036
It could be small.
But if you make it yourself,

41:55.143 --> 41:58.078
His Majesty would appreciate it more.

41:58.246 --> 42:00.214
Something small...

42:01.950 --> 42:03.975
Like 'poson' socks?

42:04.119 --> 42:06.917
He bestows that to others.

42:08.256 --> 42:10.315
Perhaps something different.

42:10.692 --> 42:12.751
Something different?

42:16.231 --> 42:18.096
I'd suggest His undergarment.

42:20.638 --> 42:22.575
That would be too embarrassing.

42:22.671 --> 42:25.162
You are husband and wife.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.945
I don't see anything inappropriate.

42:30.225 --> 42:31.225
And...

42:31.880 --> 42:34.508
While you make the gift,

42:35.183 --> 42:43.716
I'd like to make a dress
for your audience with His Majesty.

42:44.659 --> 42:47.059
Please allow me the opportunity.

43:01.243 --> 43:02.243
Mr. Head Tailor!

43:02.577 --> 43:03.805
Mr. Head Tailor!

43:04.813 --> 43:05.813
Mr. Head Tailor!

43:06.633 --> 43:08.033
Keep your voice down!

43:08.283 --> 43:09.477
Is he here?

43:09.551 --> 43:10.575
You little...

43:12.187 --> 43:13.187
What's going on?

43:13.221 --> 43:17.180
Do you know what
the King's undergarment looks like?

43:20.128 --> 43:21.686
Undergarment...

43:23.765 --> 43:26.199
It's no different than mine.

43:26.294 --> 43:30.371
Thought it'd be more special.
Maybe have a dragon in the middle.

43:36.753 --> 43:37.820
A wedding dress?

43:43.718 --> 43:45.845
You should go if you're done.

43:55.263 --> 43:57.424
This is why
you're the Head Tailor.

43:58.066 --> 43:59.795
The sewing is flawless.

44:00.502 --> 44:03.403
This is the most beautifully crafted
dress I've seen.

44:08.153 --> 44:09.353
You're doing well.

44:10.512 --> 44:15.677
Go halve the length on
the second stitch.

44:16.751 --> 44:18.651
He says you're doing well.

44:18.787 --> 44:21.517
He says go halve the length
on the second stitch.

44:21.656 --> 44:23.590
I've never seen this technique.

44:23.858 --> 44:24.916
I've never seen...

44:25.060 --> 44:30.020
I learned this from my late mother.

44:30.298 --> 44:32.562
It is called a 'half-stitch.'

44:32.801 --> 44:37.101
There are no rules for sewing.

44:38.139 --> 44:43.008
I think the easiest method
is the best method.

44:45.814 --> 44:48.681
The method was taught by
his late mother...

44:50.185 --> 44:52.881
He says there are no rules...

44:53.121 --> 44:55.021
I also learned sewing
from my mother.

44:55.390 --> 44:57.984
I also learned sewing
from my mother.

45:00.459 --> 45:02.725
Violets were her favorite flowers.

45:03.732 --> 45:07.327
My father said he'd plant
many of them on her grave.

45:07.969 --> 45:09.834
I wonder if he did.

45:11.740 --> 45:14.174
I've never been.

45:24.819 --> 45:31.224
I heard His Majesty is away
on a hunting trip.

45:39.978 --> 45:40.978
Your Highness.

45:53.823 --> 45:56.268
Something's missing...

46:01.423 --> 46:03.448
Stay still.

47:46.228 --> 47:48.822
Bulls eye!

47:57.539 --> 47:59.336
I want to make it like this.

48:04.713 --> 48:05.873
Mr. Head Tailor.

48:07.082 --> 48:09.880
The new hunting outfit
fits handsomely.

48:11.420 --> 48:15.083
It's quite different from
the ones you made.

48:16.191 --> 48:19.786
Let's have him make another piece.

48:34.025 --> 48:37.013
<i>Let's have him make another piece.</i>

48:38.313 --> 48:41.305
<i>He seems very talented.</i>

48:57.866 --> 49:03.463
They're going crazy for your
clothes, yet you're here.

49:03.672 --> 49:08.166
- You scared me...
- People seem to like this robe.

49:10.979 --> 49:12.310
Should we have a drink?

49:14.783 --> 49:16.273
What are you doing in there?

49:17.185 --> 49:20.018
You scared me...

49:50.886 --> 49:51.886
Look at this.

49:51.987 --> 49:53.978
Have you ever seen
something like this?

49:54.656 --> 49:57.284
No, Your Highness.

49:57.759 --> 50:00.091
It resembles
the shape of a jar...

50:00.295 --> 50:02.160
So beautiful...

50:02.789 --> 50:04.313
Can I try the other one?

50:13.408 --> 50:15.569
I've never seen
this design before.

50:15.610 --> 50:17.373
The sleeves are so...

50:17.479 --> 50:19.538
Look at the
full body of the skirt.

50:19.648 --> 50:24.347
Beautiful yet so simple.
It is absolutely ravishing.

50:24.519 --> 50:26.612
It's beautiful.

50:42.804 --> 50:44.738
Mr. Head Tailor is indeed talented.

50:44.840 --> 50:47.673
How did you think of
such a creation?

50:56.818 --> 50:59.150
You made Her dress without...

51:04.626 --> 51:06.025
What do you think?

51:17.539 --> 51:19.769
Isn't it a little bland?

51:28.250 --> 51:29.877
Will you embroider it for me?

51:30.418 --> 51:33.387
No one embroiders better than you.

51:59.481 --> 52:01.039
Here you go, sir.

52:09.291 --> 52:10.690
Can you hear it?

52:33.848 --> 52:35.577
What's with this shabby ceremony?

52:36.922 --> 52:37.968
Where is His Majesty?

52:39.521 --> 52:40.521
Let me go!

52:40.588 --> 52:41.588
I said let go!

52:41.690 --> 52:44.955
With Her Highness' generosity
as deep as the sea,

52:45.360 --> 52:48.761
the Queen bestows you with
the 2nd-tier title.

52:49.998 --> 52:51.329
Let go!

52:54.102 --> 52:55.102
Your Majesty.

52:55.370 --> 52:59.067
You are to wed the Defense Chief's
daughter today.

52:59.207 --> 53:01.300
Shall I prepare your bed there?

53:38.046 --> 53:40.776
You can't go in.

53:46.788 --> 53:48.449
You can't go in. Your Highness.

53:52.627 --> 53:53.992
Your Highness.

54:34.074 --> 54:35.074
Your Highness.

54:55.190 --> 54:56.714
Your Highness...

54:57.527 --> 54:59.757
you don't like the dress?

55:04.299 --> 55:06.631
I have this beautiful dress.

55:07.803 --> 55:09.964
But nowhere to go.

55:25.921 --> 55:27.411
Your Highness.

55:30.292 --> 55:31.691
Your Highness.

55:43.772 --> 55:46.536
I remember my first day
in the palace.

55:47.809 --> 55:49.242
Back then...

55:50.278 --> 55:52.872
My only dream was
to be with His Majesty.

56:11.933 --> 56:13.366
Do you...

56:16.538 --> 56:17.835
have a dream?

56:58.613 --> 57:00.410
Move everything inside!

57:00.582 --> 57:01.582
Hurry!

57:05.987 --> 57:07.021
What a mess.

57:07.022 --> 57:09.023
Get them off the racks!

57:09.024 --> 57:10.691
Hurry up!

57:10.692 --> 57:12.125
Yeah, get that!

57:13.428 --> 57:16.886
Why aren't you helping?

57:16.998 --> 57:19.228
I just don't understand.

57:19.334 --> 57:20.062
What?

57:20.235 --> 57:22.226
Her Highness.

57:22.738 --> 57:24.205
She's so beautiful...

57:24.306 --> 57:27.969
Everyone has a story,
regardless of status.

57:28.043 --> 57:28.873
My robe!

57:28.944 --> 57:30.536
Use the other door!

57:33.582 --> 57:38.019
Neglected by her husband
at such a young age.

57:38.153 --> 57:40.519
It's a true pity.

57:40.589 --> 57:41.715
According to rumors,

57:42.224 --> 57:43.987
it's been like that since
the wedding night.

57:45.560 --> 57:48.324
<i>Back when His Majesty was still a prince.</i>

57:48.463 --> 57:51.728
<i>Bride candidates were
called in for his brother.</i>

57:51.833 --> 57:55.098
<i>And he fell for one of them.</i>

57:55.203 --> 57:57.763
<i>He fell for his possible sister-in-law.</i>

57:58.540 --> 58:00.371
<i>It was an unfortunate situation.</i>

58:00.542 --> 58:03.943
<i>His brother found out, and guess what?</i>

58:04.479 --> 58:05.776
Father.

58:06.748 --> 58:09.216
Baby brother is also of age.

58:09.351 --> 58:11.842
I suggest you grant him a bride,

58:11.987 --> 58:14.182
from one of the maidens
not chosen.

58:15.824 --> 58:17.155
<i>He acted all generous</i>

58:17.292 --> 58:20.125
<i>and tossed over the girl like a leftover.</i>

58:20.729 --> 58:21.753
<i>Think about it,</i>

58:22.497 --> 58:25.398
<i>she'd always be the left over.</i>

58:25.500 --> 58:27.491
<i>She's neglected by His Majesty.</i>

58:27.941 --> 58:30.674
<i>And now that new girl is driving her out.</i>

58:31.740 --> 58:37.337
<i>Do you know why the Prime Minister
supports the new girl?</i>

58:38.146 --> 58:42.708
He's trying to replace the Queen.

58:50.692 --> 58:52.660
How is it that you get older

58:52.794 --> 58:58.164
but still stay on top
over fresh young girls?

58:58.867 --> 59:02.803
When customers flock to a new girl
and she gets arrogant...

59:03.004 --> 59:07.407
I just send in younger girls
to get them back.

59:08.076 --> 59:11.341
Then the new arrogant girl
becomes obedient to me,

59:11.513 --> 59:16.883
and the younger ones look to me
to get good customers.

59:17.219 --> 59:20.950
Naturally, they treat me
with utmost respect.

59:36.371 --> 59:37.531
What's the matter?

59:37.739 --> 59:38.262
You don't like it?

59:38.406 --> 59:40.169
No, it's not that.

59:49.684 --> 59:50.684
Lady Hong.

59:51.386 --> 59:52.386
Yes, Your Majesty.

59:52.520 --> 59:53.680
Could you move?

01:00:05.767 --> 01:00:06.927
Your Majesty!

01:00:46.007 --> 01:00:47.007
Your Majesty!

01:00:47.008 --> 01:00:48.008
Your Majesty!

01:01:56.878 --> 01:01:59.005
How dare you seduce His Majesty!

01:01:59.147 --> 01:01:59.875
Your Highness!

01:02:00.015 --> 01:02:01.982
Please spare your anger!

01:02:01.983 --> 01:02:02.650
Your Highness.

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:03.742
Take it off!

01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:05.085
You're not worthy!

01:02:05.086 --> 01:02:07.213
- How dare you!
- Your Highness.

01:02:21.636 --> 01:02:23.103
How dare you!

01:02:25.607 --> 01:02:27.575
Don't just stand around!
Stop her!

01:02:31.646 --> 01:02:33.807
How come you can't make them?

01:02:33.915 --> 01:02:37.248
Don't you make
the Queen's dresses?

01:02:37.385 --> 01:02:38.647
It is true.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.619
But I don't make the dresses
you describe.

01:02:43.758 --> 01:02:47.285
Perhaps he doesn't know
how to make them.

01:02:47.395 --> 01:02:50.125
I heard there's a good tailor
in the other town.

01:02:50.231 --> 01:02:51.755
Let's go there.

01:02:51.866 --> 01:02:53.060
No wonder.

01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:56.069
You've gone out of fashion,
Mr. Head Tailor.

01:03:26.468 --> 01:03:29.767
The Queen wore this?

01:03:29.905 --> 01:03:31.270
Oh, look!

01:03:31.406 --> 01:03:33.374
Such a beautiful color!

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:38.312
This full skirt here,
it's what the Queen wore.

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:41.882
Sir.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.356
He is disrupting the world.

01:03:45.187 --> 01:03:48.452
Kong-jin is secretly making dresses
in the palace.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.831
We implore you, Your Majesty!

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.745
Mr. Prime Minister.

01:04:10.912 --> 01:04:14.473
I guess the cabinet has
nothing better to do.

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:18.259
Petitioning over a trivial
matter such as women's attire.

01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:20.822
It's not just any women, Your Majesty.

01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:24.554
Women inside the palace and outside

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:31.165
are violating the decorum and
corrupting the morals of this nation.

01:04:31.266 --> 01:04:34.429
So women want to wear beautiful clothes.

01:04:34.703 --> 01:04:36.466
The wives of noblemen

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:41.605
are indulging in excess to
imitate Her Highness' fashion.

01:04:41.843 --> 01:04:45.176
The Qing envoys will soon arrive.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.607
What if they hear about this?

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:51.016
You're not worried about clothes.

01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:54.984
You want to dethrone the Queen.

01:04:57.392 --> 01:04:59.451
We implore you, Your Majesty.

01:05:00.462 --> 01:05:02.293
We implore you, Your Majesty.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.265
Do you remember the day we first met?

01:05:17.479 --> 01:05:19.811
I remember clearly, Your Majesty.

01:05:20.682 --> 01:05:26.712
Because the first garment I ever made
was your robe.

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:29.817
That's right.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:36.227
That year, my late brother
was chosen as the heir.

01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:42.768
<i>One day, I was having
lunch with my brother.</i>

01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:45.701
<i>At the time, I had a craving for meat.</i>

01:05:46.374 --> 01:05:48.604
<i>So I asked the nanny for ribs.</i>

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:49.777
<i>But...</i>

01:05:51.046 --> 01:05:53.105
<i>For some reason, she wouldn't.</i>

01:05:53.815 --> 01:05:55.612
<i>Do you know why?</i>

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:59.216
<i>Because my brother wanted it first.</i>

01:06:00.021 --> 01:06:02.216
<i>He knew I liked meat.</i>

01:06:02.857 --> 01:06:05.417
<i>And he did so on purpose.</i>

01:06:06.461 --> 01:06:08.952
He wanted me to know that he was the heir.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:13.394
That he would be the sole ruler.

01:06:14.997 --> 01:06:17.664
<i>He ate all the meat.</i>

01:06:18.373 --> 01:06:20.864
<i>But he left me one piece.</i>

01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:23.869
Do you know what he said?

01:06:27.182 --> 01:06:28.410
You can have it.

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.384
What do you think I did?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.899
That was when.

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.965
That's when I first
understood what power is.

01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:58.902
The fellow who made the hunting outfit...

01:06:59.414 --> 01:07:01.882
So his clothes are ruining
the discipline in court.

01:07:02.717 --> 01:07:06.016
I don't care what the Prime Minister says.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.252
But I do care about the
authority of the court.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:12.652
But...

01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:15.952
I don't think I need to get involved.

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:20.563
<i>Mr. Head Tailor.</i>

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:23.031
<i>You should handle it.</i>

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:27.531
<i>I wish to wear your clothes again...</i>

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:34.445
How could you make these
cheap, tasteless dresses?

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.175
'Cheap'?

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.622
A garment should reflect
social status and decorum.

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:48.523
What's wrong with clothes
that are comfortable and pretty?

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:51.031
We make clothes for the King.

01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:55.363
The hunting outfit I made.
Is that cheap too?

01:07:58.673 --> 01:08:01.005
I am the Head Tailor!

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.059
After this moment...

01:08:19.961 --> 01:08:25.058
if I see anyone wearing
one of these cheap dresses,

01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:27.701
you will be punished by
His Majesty's orders!

01:08:30.071 --> 01:08:32.733
Isn't it a little extreme?

01:08:32.807 --> 01:08:34.468
It's His Majesty's orders.

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:44.033
What are you waiting for?

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.651
Get rid of them at once!

01:08:58.166 --> 01:09:01.328
Come on, no need for this.

01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:03.871
Don't do this.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.639
Let's talk about it.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:34.502
It's the King's orders!

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:42.803
If you disobey, you can be put to death.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:47.509
I'll just leave.

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:51.255
This damn palace.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.388
I'll just leave then.

01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:10.261
The envoys sent by the Qing
Emperor will soon arrive.

01:10:10.438 --> 01:10:12.406
If we fail to get their approval again...

01:10:12.574 --> 01:10:14.474
So what you mean is

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:18.038
since I wasn't approved by the Chinese,

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.875
I'm not really the king yet?

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:25.481
No, Your Majesty. Even your late brother,

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:29.887
with an excuse that he didn't have an heir,

01:10:30.358 --> 01:10:33.725
didn't receive the emperor's blessing.

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.022
Forgive me for saying this...

01:10:38.099 --> 01:10:45.096
But they have also questioned your birth.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.268
At the welcome ceremony for the Qings,

01:10:50.378 --> 01:10:55.247
I implore you to invite Mistress
So-yi instead of the Queen.

01:10:55.383 --> 01:10:56.941
Does this country...

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:00.121
...belong to Chosun?

01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:01.750
Or the Qings?

01:11:05.456 --> 01:11:05.888
Your Majesty!

01:11:32.687 --> 01:11:34.354
Prime Minister, the old bastard!

01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:38.815
I'll have his head one day. His head!

01:11:41.883 --> 01:11:44.283
I was born and raised in the palace.

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:49.997
But nothing in this palace was ever mine!

01:11:50.171 --> 01:11:53.971
Even the nameless grass
outside wasn't mine.

01:11:54.509 --> 01:11:56.773
Nothing was mine.

01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:59.471
Even the Queen!

01:12:00.748 --> 01:12:03.273
Do you know why I'm indifferent to her?

01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:08.252
Because she was...

01:12:09.057 --> 01:12:12.322
like the piece of meat my brother left me.

01:12:14.762 --> 01:12:19.665
But I recently realized
that we're the same.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.937
I've become king.

01:12:23.905 --> 01:12:26.635
But I still can't do what I want.

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:33.538
Do you know why I replaced
all the officials...

01:12:34.544 --> 01:12:36.676
But spared you?

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:40.986
You're the one

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:45.326
who made the first thing
that was really mine.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.462
Your Majesty.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.458
Is true, Father?

01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:55.530
Yes, His Majesty has approved it.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:13:01.166
Your Highness will be seated at the throne.

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.211
Did you hear that?

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:08.578
You are the Head Tailor,
the best in Chosun.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.685
I have to be the most
beautiful woman there.

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.757
You're not going back to the palace?

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.392
Everyone's getting new
clothes for the ceremony.

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:33.366
But the Queen can't even get a new scarf.

01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:38.368
And the Prime Minister's
putting So-yi at the throne.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:41.614
If she's introduced as the
queen to the Qings...

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:42.945
Kong-jin.

01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:54.285
Please allow me to make your
dress for the ceremony.

01:13:54.362 --> 01:13:56.353
I'm not attending.

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.567
Why...

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.328
Why do you keep avoiding?

01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:06.573
I promise...

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:10.668
I will make everyone bow before you.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.076
That's enough. You should leave.

01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:16.309
It will be something completely new.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:20.816
No man including His Majesty,

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.386
will be able to take his eyes off you.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:29.228
You'll be the most beautiful
woman in the world.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.639
Bring the girls in for measurement.

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.105
Your Highness!

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:45.543
Forgive me, Your Highness.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.846
The dress I intend to make,

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.952
has never been made before.

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:58.586
I must measure myself for it to be perfect.

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.291
Please allow me.

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:14.236
<i>You may never lay your hand on Her person.</i>

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.680
Forgive me...

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:34.059
For I must lay my hand on Your person.

01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:52.971
You must stand straight for me to measure.

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.862
Take these away too.

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:54.598
Kong-jin's coming back.

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:58.475
He can't just come and go as he pleases.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.677
Are you talking back to me?

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.980
Of course not.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.087
You little bastard.

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:14.727
Sir, is something wrong?

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.490
Close your eyes.

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.063
What do you see?

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.301
Nothing, sir.

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:28.470
Forget it.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:08.010
I thought I'd drop in for a drink.

01:18:08.156 --> 01:18:12.263
I thought this place was
too 'cheap' for you.

01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:44.111
I have no business with you.

01:18:46.877 --> 01:18:48.144
You should go back.

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:08.071
Did you draw these?

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:20.013
Who is this for?

01:19:20.588 --> 01:19:21.782
Get out.

01:19:21.856 --> 01:19:22.515
Leave!

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.315
You're not...

01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:31.010
There's a certain line

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.394
you must never cross.

01:19:36.368 --> 01:19:37.368
I don't care.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.269
What about Her Highness?

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.567
Don't you know...

01:19:43.072 --> 01:19:46.269
that you're putting Her in danger?

01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:52.415
How much more danger?

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:56.922
She doesn't even have a
seat at the ceremony.

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:04.457
They say that So-yi will
be seated at the throne.

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:08.894
Tell me.

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:11.161
Will it be any more dangerous?

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.500
Will it be any different?

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:17.306
I didn't see anything.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.755
You've been at it for days.

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.762
You should stop.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.071
Please stop.

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.572
Stop!

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:24.573
I heard you could be killed
if you make this dress.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.677
Please!

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:48.628
I have to be the most
beautiful woman there.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:53.606
His daughter could very
well be the next queen.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:57.475
Your need to keep it up.

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.613
It's time to go home, sir.

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:03.241
What do you think?

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:06.918
Tell me.

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:13.752
I couldn't possibly judge your work, sir.

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:17.897
Fine. You may leave.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:07.579
Did he tell you where he was going?

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.944
No, sir...

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.014
I don't know where he went.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:31.863
Sir, it's Dae-gil.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.798
Are you awake?

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.034
This was it.

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:46.342
Sir, this is... truly beautiful.

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:50.481
These drawings are amazing.

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.083
Did you say...

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.392
Beautiful?

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.256
Yes, sir.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:06.561
They're like images from a dream.

01:25:15.911 --> 01:25:20.211
They're that beautiful?

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.314
Yes, sir.

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:26.911
You now have Chosun in
the palm of your hand.

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:41.890
First bow!

01:26:47.846 --> 01:26:49.110
Second bow!

01:27:20.848 --> 01:27:23.962
Your Highness, the ceremony
is about to start.

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:03.375
Make way for Mistress So-yi!

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:52.527
What are you waiting for?

01:28:52.711 --> 01:28:54.109
Announce her presence.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.561
Actually, ma'am...

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:02.432
Make way for the Queen!

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.450
You look beautiful tonight.

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:31.843
My Lady.

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:18.059
You call yourself the
top tailor of this nation?

01:32:24.573 --> 01:32:26.063
Your Highness.

01:32:27.612 --> 01:32:30.182
Do you envy that cheap dress?

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:31.979
What?

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:40.780
That low life who makes obscene dresses

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:42.890
without any principles.

01:32:43.866 --> 01:32:46.431
Bewitched by such a man,

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:49.129
completely disregarding the decorum,

01:32:50.332 --> 01:32:53.563
the Queen who supports him,

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:56.059
I'm asking, do you envy her?

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:07.106
I wanted to see Your Highness
before I leave the palace.

01:33:07.716 --> 01:33:09.016
Leave?

01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:13.920
People outside are begging me to
make their clothes.

01:33:24.199 --> 01:33:27.828
I wish to visit the
Queen's quarters tonight.

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:33.135
The Queen, Your Majesty?

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:41.111
You once asked if I have a dream.

01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:43.484
I'm ashamed to admit

01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:47.783
that I'd never thought about it.

01:33:50.179 --> 01:33:51.179
But then...

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:55.493
I met you, Your Highness.

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:58.324
And I was able to dream.

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:02.093
Every moment I spent with you.

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.266
To me...

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:09.939
It was like a dream.

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:16.640
Now...

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:20.018
I need a new dream.

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.920
I sincerely hope...

01:34:25.872 --> 01:34:27.237
your dreams come true.

01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:36.024
It's been an honor.

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.674
Take care, Your Highness.

01:34:44.713 --> 01:34:47.944
Make way for His Majesty.

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:14.132
I was asking him for
a new garment.

01:35:17.379 --> 01:35:21.076
Please allow me to excuse myself.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:35:59.713
I think...

01:36:01.957 --> 01:36:03.686
I made a mistake coming here.

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:35.908
Make way for the Queen!

01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:07.072
Your Majesty.

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:13.249
You should govern the
court with a firmer hand.

01:38:16.058 --> 01:38:18.754
I recently heard some disturbing rumors.

01:38:19.628 --> 01:38:23.029
While you were away on your hunting trip,

01:38:23.198 --> 01:38:28.795
the Queen went out the
palace with a young tailor.

01:38:30.272 --> 01:38:35.039
His name was... Lee Kong-jin.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.848
I also heard

01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:44.179
that recently, the Queen sent
her attendants away

01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:50.517
and had the tailor
personally measure her size.

01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:54.411
Pathetic, isn't it?

01:39:55.457 --> 01:39:57.721
For a piece of clothing,

01:39:57.959 --> 01:40:00.291
a woman like the Queen would...

01:40:12.307 --> 01:40:13.638
But the thing is...

01:40:16.745 --> 01:40:18.975
When I look at this hunting outfit,

01:40:20.982 --> 01:40:24.383
I think I can understand her.

01:40:30.892 --> 01:40:32.325
Mr. Head Tailor.

01:40:33.693 --> 01:40:36.515
I wish to wear a dragon
robe made by that fellow.

01:40:37.699 --> 01:40:42.693
But it seems that he is
busy with the Queen.

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:47.163
So, can you make it instead?

01:40:49.644 --> 01:40:52.545
Just like the one he'd make.

01:40:57.152 --> 01:41:00.747
So no one can tell the difference.

01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:05.253
And that it's...

01:41:06.428 --> 01:41:09.363
a gift from the Prime Minister.

01:41:29.618 --> 01:41:33.384
I lined it with hemp cuz your
father is heat sensitive.

01:41:33.555 --> 01:41:35.386
Will keep him cool.

01:41:37.759 --> 01:41:39.351
Thank you, sir.

01:41:48.036 --> 01:41:49.833
You'll go bankrupt.

01:41:53.174 --> 01:41:54.402
Your Highness.

01:42:01.283 --> 01:42:02.807
You're mistaken!

01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:06.315
How dare you! Let me go!

01:42:08.957 --> 01:42:10.357
Seize him for high treason!

01:42:10.358 --> 01:42:11.358
What are you...

01:42:11.726 --> 01:42:12.886
Pan-soo!

01:42:35.784 --> 01:42:38.184
Since you cherished his work,

01:42:38.887 --> 01:42:41.515
I trusted him to make my robe.

01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:45.016
To my surprise...

01:42:46.261 --> 01:42:49.458
There was a poisoned needle hidden inside.

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:54.266
Fortunately, our Head Tailor found it.

01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:58.066
Are you sure he made it?

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.505
Yes, Your Highness.

01:43:00.642 --> 01:43:02.132
It's not true.

01:43:02.877 --> 01:43:05.402
I didn't make that.

01:43:05.981 --> 01:43:07.881
If it's one of my clothes,

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:11.151
it will have a bracken leaf on it.

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:27.926
There isn't one.

01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:35.235
Your Majesty.

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:40.742
I think it would be fair
to check the other garments.

01:43:57.399 --> 01:43:58.465
Well...

01:43:58.466 --> 01:43:59.899
Do you see one?

01:44:00.702 --> 01:44:02.670
I have to say...

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.007
I do not see one.

01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:18.651
I thought hard about this.

01:44:18.987 --> 01:44:21.455
Who put him up to it?

01:44:21.723 --> 01:44:26.183
He's a lowly seamster
with no political affiliation.

01:44:26.294 --> 01:44:29.593
Why would he try to assassinate
the king?

01:44:30.498 --> 01:44:32.022
Just as I was pondering,

01:44:32.367 --> 01:44:36.633
I heard a rumor about
you and that tailor.

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.973
My Lady.

01:44:40.909 --> 01:44:43.275
Were you conspiring with him
all along?

01:44:44.245 --> 01:44:47.271
Is that why
you are defending him?

01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:49.974
Tell me.

01:44:50.118 --> 01:44:52.348
I did it alone.

01:44:54.389 --> 01:44:59.850
I dare longed for the Queen.

01:45:00.562 --> 01:45:02.029
That's why I did it.

01:45:02.931 --> 01:45:04.865
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

01:45:09.938 --> 01:45:11.496
Tell me.

01:45:12.941 --> 01:45:14.499
Is this true?

01:45:18.547 --> 01:45:20.811
I asked you if this is true.

01:45:23.819 --> 01:45:26.014
- I...
- Her Highness...

01:45:26.888 --> 01:45:28.913
She doesn't know anything.

01:45:43.372 --> 01:45:48.309
I wasn't aware.

01:45:53.281 --> 01:45:54.873
I guess...

01:45:56.084 --> 01:45:58.382
I shouldn't have doubted you.

01:46:00.981 --> 01:46:01.981
You may leave.

01:46:15.537 --> 01:46:17.971
So you did it by yourself.

01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:20.736
Tell me the truth.

01:46:31.153 --> 01:46:33.747
Who put you up to it?

01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:36.101
Was it the Prime Minister?

01:46:36.561 --> 01:46:37.717
Please stop.

01:46:44.766 --> 01:46:50.898
Do you still think that nothing
in the palace is yours?

01:46:51.873 --> 01:46:54.899
I once hoped that
you wouldn't become king.

01:46:55.405 --> 01:46:56.790
The day I was chosen as your wife.

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.643
I can't forget your eyes
looking at your brother.

01:47:03.318 --> 01:47:04.512
But...

01:47:04.786 --> 01:47:08.017
I thought I could make you happy.

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:09.590
Stop.

01:47:09.591 --> 01:47:11.320
We're sad people.

01:47:11.927 --> 01:47:14.452
This won't change anything.

01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:18.163
You can't let things go,
and I won't give up.

01:47:18.366 --> 01:47:20.300
Stop it!

01:47:25.216 --> 01:47:27.184
Your Majesty...

01:47:29.611 --> 01:47:31.614
You are a coward.

01:47:57.339 --> 01:48:00.638
This man
tried to assassinate me.

01:48:01.476 --> 01:48:03.467
For his treasonous crime,

01:48:07.849 --> 01:48:09.544
he shall be beheaded.

01:48:36.911 --> 01:48:38.003
Pour your soul.

01:48:39.247 --> 01:48:40.271
Tend with care.

01:48:41.983 --> 01:48:43.109
Soul.

01:48:44.252 --> 01:48:45.583
Care.

01:48:46.621 --> 01:48:47.952
Soul.

01:48:49.357 --> 01:48:50.585
Care.

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:53.118
Soul.

01:48:53.895 --> 01:48:54.953
Care.

01:49:02.575 --> 01:49:05.042
I wish to be the best like you,
Mr. Head Tailor.

01:49:07.075 --> 01:49:09.202
This is why you're the Head Tailor.

01:49:13.715 --> 01:49:17.947
Will you embroider it for me?
No one's better than you.

01:50:13.074 --> 01:50:15.167
When I see your hands...

01:50:16.622 --> 01:50:18.038
I just felt warm.

01:50:20.435 --> 01:50:21.914
Hands that were

01:50:23.451 --> 01:50:27.478
tortured from sewing, just like mine.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.528
I thought that if no one else,

01:50:37.378 --> 01:50:38.378
you would...

01:50:40.769 --> 01:50:47.265
you would understand and trust me.

01:50:50.278 --> 01:50:51.836
That dragon robe.

01:50:54.504 --> 01:50:56.246
Did you make it?

01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:06.893
You should have listened to me.

01:51:09.998 --> 01:51:14.264
You shouldn't have made
Her Highness' dress.

01:51:14.402 --> 01:51:16.165
If it were me...

01:51:19.774 --> 01:51:23.005
I would have made it with a brighter silk.

01:51:30.452 --> 01:51:32.044
Your arrogance.

01:51:35.056 --> 01:51:37.251
Your arrogant clothes...

01:51:37.726 --> 01:51:40.286
That's what brought us here.

01:51:42.063 --> 01:51:44.463
It wasn't my clothes.

01:51:47.502 --> 01:51:49.299
It was your fear.

01:51:50.872 --> 01:51:53.033
That's what brought us here.

01:51:57.912 --> 01:52:00.540
You said you avoid shit
because it's filthy.

01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:07.485
Well, I had to shove it down
my throat my whole life.

01:52:09.443 --> 01:52:12.416
I dedicated my whole life to sewing.

01:52:14.362 --> 01:52:19.823
You tried to ruin my life's work.

01:52:19.934 --> 01:52:23.097
The dream I built with these two hands.

01:52:23.204 --> 01:52:24.967
My life.

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.307
So...

01:52:33.214 --> 01:52:34.875
ls that why you copied it?

01:52:49.898 --> 01:52:52.128
I am the Head Tailor.

01:52:52.934 --> 01:52:58.031
I'm the one who makes
His Majesty's garments!

01:52:59.541 --> 01:53:01.304
I hope...

01:53:03.044 --> 01:53:06.605
you will make clothes worthy of your hands.

01:53:07.949 --> 01:53:09.416
Listen closely.

01:53:10.051 --> 01:53:15.114
Your clothes will never
see the light of day.

01:53:18.426 --> 01:53:21.395
I will erase the name

01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:28.535
Lee-Kong-jin completely from our history!

01:54:03.238 --> 01:54:04.466
Begin the execution!

01:54:04.973 --> 01:54:06.201
Yes, sir!

01:55:06.367 --> 01:55:08.335
Head Tailor Cho Dol-suk.

01:55:08.585 --> 01:55:10.833
You've made significant contributions

01:55:11.272 --> 01:55:14.332
crafting clothes for
3 generations of kings.

01:55:14.858 --> 01:55:18.753
You are hereby bestowed
the sixth tier status.

01:55:34.413 --> 01:55:36.336
Your Highness.

01:55:40.335 --> 01:55:41.962
Throw it out.

01:55:48.376 --> 01:55:49.843
Your Highness.

01:55:49.911 --> 01:55:51.970
What about this?

01:57:34.115 --> 01:57:37.175
The breast tie I would embroider in gold.

01:57:37.598 --> 01:57:39.448
With a small bell on the waist.

01:57:40.021 --> 01:57:42.922
A bell's kind of tacky.
Maybe a jade ornament.

01:57:43.124 --> 01:57:44.124
It's my overcoat!

01:57:44.492 --> 01:57:46.687
Fine. Relax.

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.793
<i>I'll use the finest jade-green silk.</i>

01:57:53.935 --> 01:57:57.132
<i>And make the sleeve stylishly large.</i>

01:57:58.006 --> 01:58:02.443
<i>I'd make the wrist narrow
and the bottom wide.</i>

01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:04.671
Let me know when you become a nobleman.

01:58:04.746 --> 01:58:08.512
I'll make a killer coat for you.

01:58:14.956 --> 01:58:15.956
On second thought.

01:58:16.933 --> 01:58:19.265
I think your version...

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:23.154
is more beautiful.

02:00:05.601 --> 02:00:08.593
Sir, you should go in.

02:00:08.971 --> 02:00:10.233
They're not coming.

02:00:14.343 --> 02:00:16.311
No.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.411
His Majesty.

02:00:23.385 --> 02:00:27.947
He said, he'd call on me.

02:01:00.889 --> 02:01:06.122
