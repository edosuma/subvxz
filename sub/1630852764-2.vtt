00:35.869 --> 00:42.250


01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
Hm.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.787
Do you like having your office
in your house?

01:19.662 --> 01:20.663
You know, I do.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.292
I'll admit that I was not happy
when my landlord said

01:24.375 --> 01:27.295
that he was gonna sell
the building that my office was in.

01:27.378 --> 01:30.924
Here you go. I shudder to think
what he's gonna put in its place,

01:31.007 --> 01:35.637
but I enjoy the extra level of privacy
that this affords my clients.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.765
And the commute is quite pleasant.

01:39.974 --> 01:40.892
Have a seat.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.978
Now tell me what you know
about your birth parents.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.438
Not much.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.109
Tina and Eno are my real parents.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.736
They told the adoption agency
they wanted a baby

01:51.820 --> 01:55.115
who looked like he belonged
with a white mom and a Black dad.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.116
Hm.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.452
Mom loved to tell the story
of the night they got the call.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.413
When the nurses handed me to her,
she started sobbing,

02:02.497 --> 02:03.665
and she didn't let go…

02:05.667 --> 02:06.751
for 21 years.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.295
She sounds like a wonderful woman.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.050
Um, my birth mother
did leave a Bible for me,

02:14.134 --> 02:17.053
with a note saying
she was from a town called Serenity,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.931
and she hoped that's what I would find
with my new parents.

02:20.431 --> 02:24.018
-How long have you been looking for them?
-I mean, I was always curious.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.106
But a couple of years ago,
I… I did a home DNA kit.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.400
What did you learn from that?

02:30.900 --> 02:33.611
Zip. No matches.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.737
Which was fine,

02:34.821 --> 02:37.699
but after Mom died,

02:39.075 --> 02:40.660
Dad and I were always fighting.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.831
I needed to get out,
and I thought of Serenity.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.085
I didn't even tell him
until Erik and I went up last month.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.297
But Dad said that he understood…

02:54.299 --> 02:55.383
and Mom would have too.

02:55.466 --> 02:59.220
-Well, I'm glad you had a good visit.
-I did learn something new.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.764
-I was born in Gulfport, Mississippi.
-That's great.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.932
-Not Ohio.
-Okay.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.895
I assume that you had
an amended birth certificate?

03:07.604 --> 03:10.565
Yeah, after a while,
I… I just stopped asking questions.

03:10.648 --> 03:11.691
Hm.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.526
I was afraid I'd hurt their feelings.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.070
It's a delicate walk, to be sure.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.824
Um, if… if you'll fill this out,

03:20.366 --> 03:23.244
I'll send it to Mississippi Vital Records.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.537
-Then we--

03:24.621 --> 03:26.581
Give me one second. Hold on.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.712
Good day. Oh, thank you.

03:32.795 --> 03:33.963
Thank you.

03:40.929 --> 03:41.930
Is it your birthday?

03:42.013 --> 03:43.014
Mm, no.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.100
-That's beautiful.

03:49.187 --> 03:53.233
Wait, is that a candy bracelet?
I haven't seen one of those since I--

03:53.316 --> 03:55.109
I am gonna walk out with you.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.319
Oh. Uh, okay.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.029
-All right. Let's go.
-All right.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.622
Oh, my grandson,
what a joy to have you back with us.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.539
Thanks, Nana.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.625
The house seemed darker
without your smile.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.335
Do I really have to stay down here?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.587
Until you can get on crutches
and get upstairs.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.548
Isn't there anywhere else?
Like, maybe some place with a door?

04:17.632 --> 04:18.925
Unfortunately, no.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.344
What about your house, Nana?
Can I stay in your guest room?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.346
This is not an ideal situation
for any of us,

04:23.429 --> 04:25.098
but we will make the best of it.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.685
-And we <i>will</i> talk about how we got here.
-What do you want me to say?

04:28.768 --> 04:32.063
First of all, you haven't even told me
why you took your brother's car.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.691
Do you realize how dangerous that was?

04:34.774 --> 04:37.443
You could have hurt Nellie.
Or worse, one of you could have died.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.321
Mom, I gotta go, or I'll be late.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.115
You're picking me up
after my French final?

04:42.198 --> 04:43.199
Uh, can CeCe?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.411
No, she doesn't want to…
She's got her own finals to worry about.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.912
I'll come if your mom is busy.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
-Okay, do you want me to take you now?
-No, I can go.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.375
Thank you, Nana.
Mom, I'm fine to walk this morning.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.002
Hey, listen, take it easy,

04:54.085 --> 04:57.380
and tell Ms. McCall
if your arm hurts while you're writing.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.173
-She'll give you extra time.
-Yeah.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.675
-I got it.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.306
Mom?

05:06.389 --> 05:07.807
I got it, darling.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.892
-Thanks, Nana.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.228
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Mm-hmm.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.568
Sweetheart?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.792
What happened with you three?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.673
Think of State as just any other game.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.467
Don't let the pressure get to you.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.927
Don't listen to what
anyone else is saying.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.805
-Mm-hmm.
-But take it seriously.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.391
You'll set the tone
for the entire team from the mound.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.018
That's a huge responsibility.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.644
Sure.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.982
Hey, we wouldn't be letting you do this
if we didn't think you could. Okay?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.321
Go, Bulldogs!

06:04.155 --> 06:06.407
These look great, y'all.
Thanks so much!

06:06.491 --> 06:07.742
Shut up, Ty!

06:08.576 --> 06:10.953
Ow! Ow, Jackson, don't hurt me anymore!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.413
In what world is that funny?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.594
-Scarlet Magnolia returns!
-Hi, Trotter.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.138
Everybody's gonna be really excited
you're back with us today.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.849
-Some mail you may wanna take a look at.
-In a minute.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.268
There's a public hearing notice
you may wanna look at first.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.270
-Okay, I will. Are they in there?
-Oh yeah.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.607
Okay. Okay.

06:39.690 --> 06:40.691
Here she comes.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.486
Corner Spa,
how may I help you?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.779
Oh, sure!

06:46.322 --> 06:47.907
I am so sorry.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.325
I'm sorry!

06:49.409 --> 06:51.327
We should never get so lost
in our own pain

06:51.411 --> 06:53.162
that we can't notice someone else's.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.455
I love you.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.124
I love your boys.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.334
And everything
just got all whipped up together,

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
and I was dumping it out before I knew it.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.380
-It was a terrible night.
-Yeah.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.758
But the night has passed! Aw!

07:05.842 --> 07:07.593
I hate to interrupt.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.720
-Mrs. Lester is on the phone.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.264
I asked if I could take a message,

07:11.347 --> 07:14.142
but the message she gave me
is not one I'd like to convey verbatim.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.227
That woman is set off by a light breeze.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.728
What is it this time?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.064
-A parking ticket.
-A parking ticket for what?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.733
I don't know,
but she insists on talking to you.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.319
-Put her on hold. Let her calm a bit.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.030
Again, sorry to interrupt
your… flower show?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.701
You know how some people
call us the Sweet Magnolias?

07:31.784 --> 07:33.494
I might have heard a passing reference.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.873
-These are the Sorry Magnolias.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.916
Why I didn't see that right away.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.587
When we were in the second grade,

07:42.670 --> 07:46.132
we had a big fight,
the biggest one we'd ever had.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.843
And for some reason, Maddie and Dana Sue

07:48.926 --> 07:52.054
were unable to recognize
what I always knew to be true.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.600
Tenderheart Bear was
clearly superior to all others.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.020
And because Dana Sue
could not stand the quiet,

07:59.103 --> 08:00.271
she decided to fix it.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.816
Whenever Daddy made Mama mad,
he bought her jewelry to make up for it.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.819
So I just… I mean,
I just thought that that's what you did!

08:06.903 --> 08:11.115
So I… I, like, dug
into my Easter basket and…

08:11.199 --> 08:14.243
and pulled out three candy bracelets.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.330
Yeah, she gifted them to us,
and the fight was over.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.458
So when the bracelet's gone…

08:20.541 --> 08:22.418
…the fight is gone…

08:22.502 --> 08:23.794
…and we move on.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.631
I've witnessed something sacred.
Thanks for that.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.925
-I'm gonna get back to Mrs. Lester!

08:29.008 --> 08:30.968
-Good luck.
-Good luck, thanks!

08:31.052 --> 08:33.304
All right. You know what?
I better get going as well.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.264
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Before you go…

08:35.348 --> 08:36.182
Mm.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.684
…we do have something else
we need to talk about.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.644
Oh.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.646
-Helen.
-What's wrong?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.773
Tell me what is wrong.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.610
-I'm pregnant.
-You're what?!

08:48.361 --> 08:50.321
-Newly deaf! Shh!

08:50.905 --> 08:53.574
How… when…
You just decided to have a baby last week!

08:53.658 --> 08:55.993
I mean, that happened fast.
That… that's impressive!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.079
The good Lord moves in mysterious ways!

08:58.162 --> 08:59.789
And in old-fashioned ways.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.999
Oh my heavens! With?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.502
It happened before you-know-who left town,

09:04.585 --> 09:08.297
but I… I did not know
until Howie told me at the hospital.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.549
Does you-know-who know?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.342
Oh, definitely not.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.094
When are you gonna tell him?

09:13.177 --> 09:15.888
For right now,
this stays between us three.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.850
We're having a baby.
We're having a baby.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.811
Oh my God!

09:23.646 --> 09:25.356
I hate to bring up business

09:25.439 --> 09:29.068
in light of your heart-pounding,
earth-shattering, baby-celebrating news.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.194
But?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.488
-Uh, Micah called yesterday.
-Huh.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.866
-His brother's worse than we thought.
-Oh no. Complications?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.411
-Not health-wise, financially.
-Oh.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.455
The bill vultures
are already sniffing around.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.583
They need the money in less than a month.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.127
-Dana Sue, that's not a lot of time.
-I know. I know!

09:46.210 --> 09:49.297
I need you to make that divorce happen
faster than a knife fight in a phone booth

09:49.380 --> 09:50.881
so I can get that small-business loan.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.717
Well, my skills may be many,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.970
but not even I can change the laws
of the great state of South Carolina.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.180
Dana Sue, it takes 90 days to get a loan,

09:58.264 --> 10:01.309
and when all that's said and done,
it's close to that for a divorce.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.436
What are my options?

10:04.395 --> 10:07.064
Go to Tractor Supply
and see if they're selling money trees?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.194
I got an idea,
but you're not gonna love it.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.529
What?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.992
A second mortgage on your house.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.161
Helen.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.582
I've been in that house for years.
It's nearly paid off!

10:24.665 --> 10:25.875
And now you are suggesting

10:25.958 --> 10:30.046
that I take out a big fat mortgage payment
two years before Annie goes to college.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.839
Uh…

10:32.465 --> 10:34.216
Wow, this could not be any worse.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.635
Or could it?

10:41.349 --> 10:42.767
We need to talk about State.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.102
Yeah, it is important you come with us.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.604
To watch from the bench?

10:47.229 --> 10:49.315
I don't want people
to go through the motions

10:49.398 --> 10:51.067
just because they feel sorry for me.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.693
No one's doing that.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.030
This championship
is the end of a pretty terrific season,

10:56.113 --> 10:59.075
and a big part of that is
because of your contributions and efforts.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.036
-Coach, I appreciate that. I just--
-And you're the captain.

11:02.119 --> 11:05.373
-Yeah, but Jackson is starting.
-Everyone will look to you for leadership.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.125
They've heard the haters
doubting whether Jackson's good enough.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.128
I'll do anything for this team.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.922
I just didn't wanna be in the way,

11:13.005 --> 11:15.424
but if you guys think
the guys will listen to me, even though--

11:15.508 --> 11:16.384
They will.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.178
That's awesome.
Let me just talk to my mom.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.013
Should we mention
it'll also be fun?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.474
I thought we were sticking
with the leadership angle.

11:24.058 --> 11:24.892
Strategy.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.186
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.021
You all right? Anything I can do?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.732
No, everything's fine.
I mean, everything is what it is.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.318
Just have to get home.
My mom's watching Kyle and Katie.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.277
-Thanks.
-Bye.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.696
Thank you though.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.084
So, how was your French final?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.587
I crushed it.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.589
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.847
That seemed like a serious conversation
with you and your coaches.

12:02.930 --> 12:07.601
Yeah, actually, they were telling me
how important it is for me to go to State.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.520
Is it?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.731
Well, I don't… I don't…

12:11.814 --> 12:13.190
I wish you would…

12:13.274 --> 12:16.610
We need… we need
to talk about that because I… I just--

12:16.694 --> 12:18.154
No, we don't.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.240
They were just trying
to make me feel better.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.535
It's obviously smarter
for me to stay here in Serenity.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.705
And the team will be fine.
You know, Jackson can lead them.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.332
Yeah, that… that sounds…

12:31.625 --> 12:32.918
sounds like a smart plan.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.857
Oh my goodness.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.818
Oh, Mom.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.029
She kept these?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.955
Oh!

13:37.983 --> 13:39.652
-Ow!
-Nice pass!

13:40.694 --> 13:42.488
Thanks for inviting me to join you guys.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.324
It's wonderful to have you. Just remember
the reason for this gathering

13:45.407 --> 13:47.576
is to help Cal with his pre-State nerves.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.121
Yeah, 'cause going to State
minus our favorite player is no big deal.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.665
Kinda like this game, where…

13:52.748 --> 13:54.834
Oh, wait, I don't have a favorite player.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.046
I'm crushed. Your best friend
is not your favorite player?

13:59.129 --> 14:03.717
For about a week, this guy sent a meme
of Dolly Parton dunking a basketball…

14:04.218 --> 14:06.470
Oops!

14:06.554 --> 14:09.306
…just to convince Howie and me
to let him play with us.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.809
-Take a look at the textual evidence…
-What's this, an essay?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.937
…that accompanied Our Lady of Dollywood
ascending to the rim.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.315
It said I'd impress you
with my prowess and stamina.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.360
So, uh, which one of us
is not worn out already?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.655
-Oh!
-Whoa!

14:24.738 --> 14:26.782
Trotter, I

14:28.450 --> 14:29.577
will always

14:31.495 --> 14:32.371
beat you.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.042
Now this is where I'm gonna need
some defensive backup,

14:37.126 --> 14:41.171
'cause in any second,
these two are gonna start singing.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.466
Well, I got you covered.
I can sing and dunk…

14:44.550 --> 14:46.969
…at the same time!

14:47.928 --> 14:50.347
-I miss Erik so much right now.
-He'll be back next week.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.641
-Once the restaurant's figured out.
-Figured out?

14:52.725 --> 14:56.395
They're trying to figure out
how to buy out her partner or something.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.439
-Wait, is Dana Sue in trouble?
-No, she…

14:58.522 --> 15:01.483
Yeah, I… I shouldn't have said anything.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.486
No, what's said on the court
stays on the court. Cone of silence.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.239
Yeah. Not to be confused
with the cone of shame

15:07.323 --> 15:09.909
that Trotter's gonna have to wear
if he misses more shots.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.749
Dolly and I say,
I'm gonna beat you just because I can.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.848
Is that Nellie?

15:32.932 --> 15:33.807
No.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.146
She came by the spa the other day
to see how you were doing.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.439
It's another friend.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.526
Good. Glad you're talking to your friends.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.364
Someone from church?

15:48.948 --> 15:49.782
No.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.202
You saw all the cards

15:53.285 --> 15:55.871
that Katie's Sunday school class
made for you.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.791
Some others came in the mail today.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.044
Everybody's worried about you.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.510
So am I.

16:13.681 --> 16:17.226
I promise you I am not gonna be mad.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.103
You're not gonna get in trouble.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.647
You've been punished enough.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.525
I simply wanna know
what happened that night.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.905
Why did you take Ty's car?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.620
Was it to get away from the drinking?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.458
Did someone do or say something to you?

16:44.586 --> 16:46.630
We have always been able to talk

16:47.756 --> 16:48.757
about anything.

16:50.592 --> 16:54.013
Why not now, when it's so important?

16:55.597 --> 16:57.141
What are you thinking?

16:57.224 --> 16:58.183
Nothing!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.668
-The heck's going on with you, man?
-Nothing.

17:27.254 --> 17:31.216
Okay, well,
whatever it is, give Mom a break.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.427
She's been through a lot
the past few days.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.224
Look, it's both our faults,
but right now, you're making it worse!

17:40.017 --> 17:43.145
You know, she's scared
there's something really wrong with you.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.378
Now, I know
what's on your mind, all right?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.422
But before you say anything, I just want--

18:10.506 --> 18:12.382
We need to stay married.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.179
I'm listening, wife.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.515
On paper only.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.809
It's purely a business arrangement.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.228
Hm. Going into business together.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.189
I need to take out
a second mortgage on the house.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.776
In our name,

18:31.652 --> 18:32.820
on our house

18:34.196 --> 18:35.405
that we built together?

18:36.532 --> 18:41.954
The house where our daughter sleeps
every night and will continue to do so

18:42.037 --> 18:46.625
because you are going along with this
to make sure I don't lose the restaurant.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.961
Well, I think

18:50.045 --> 18:53.173
you'll be tickled to find out
how much I can help your cause.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.384
The way you can help my cause

18:55.467 --> 18:58.887
is to sign your name on the application
and let me get about my business.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.305
I can do that.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.640
Great.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.685
-I can also get us a better interest rate.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.396
You been holding up some banks
I didn't know about?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.898
I've been working hard, you know?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.108
Mm-hmm.

19:11.191 --> 19:15.195
I've got my credit score up,
opened up a couple of small CDs.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.783
I even bought a… a trailer
over on Lake Wateree

19:19.867 --> 19:21.702
to rent out to tourists this summer.

19:26.498 --> 19:32.337
Well, there's probably some pretty teller
at the bank you're trying to impress.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.673
Maybe a beautiful chef in a kitchen.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.719
Don't start flirting,
Mr. "Look how much I've changed."

19:38.802 --> 19:40.012
Okay, you know what?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.556
We are talking cold, hard numbers here

19:42.639 --> 19:45.726
so that I can save the restaurant
and still send Annie to college.

19:47.019 --> 19:51.023
Well, I mean, look,
if cash flow is the concern…

19:51.106 --> 19:52.399
No, no, no, this…

19:53.108 --> 19:55.027
…I could, uh… could move in.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.447
Look, I mean,
look how much money I would save

19:58.530 --> 20:02.492
if I didn't have to pay Harold Thomas
for a room down at the motor lodge.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.209
Can we please do this

20:11.919 --> 20:13.253
for our little girl?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.428
Anything for our little girl.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.513
Thank you.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.852
So to seal the deal, do we shake hands,

20:28.936 --> 20:30.687
or do we kiss?

20:33.523 --> 20:34.566
Oh gosh.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.002
-Oh!
-Oh, Miss Frances.

20:54.878 --> 20:58.257
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.260
Oh, can't knock me down
with a simple scare.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.971
Need something stronger
like a fleet of Mack Trucks.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.973
How are you, my dear?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.934
I'm good. I'm good.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.813
Wonderful. I was worried
with Ryan leaving that you might--

21:12.896 --> 21:15.023
That's sweet of you
to be concerned, thank you.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.150
There's so much history
between you and Ryan,

21:17.234 --> 21:20.112
and I keep hoping and praying,
and then he…

21:21.071 --> 21:22.114
Oh.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.741
I wanted to make sure
that you were holding up.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.537
And I appreciate that,
but I really am fine.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.165
Though that won't last long
if I keep Judge Sargent waiting.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.625
Oh, yeah.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.294
-Will you excuse me?
-Yes.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.670
Good to see you.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.224
Coach!

21:50.100 --> 21:51.143
Coach Maddox!

21:52.352 --> 21:53.312
Hey, Ty.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.980
Hey, you got a sec?

21:55.063 --> 21:58.233
Yeah, I'm always happy to get away
from Watergate for a bit. What's up?

21:59.192 --> 22:01.320
I wanted to wish you luck at State.

22:01.945 --> 22:02.988
I talked to my mom,

22:03.071 --> 22:05.741
and with everything that happened,
I'm… I'm not going.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.034
-Did Jackson do something?
-No.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.869
-One of the other players?
-No, they're great.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.454
The whole season has been awesome.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.334
-Maybe if I talk to your mom--
-I already did. Thanks. Good luck.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.815
-Hey, Annie.
-Hey, Jackson.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.110
Uh, did you make all those?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.988
The posters? Some.
The newspaper staff thought they'd be good

22:45.072 --> 22:46.990
to take to the game,
get the crowd amped up.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.575
Gotcha.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.538
Everybody thinks
you're gonna win, and you will.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.750
We'll see.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.043
Good luck.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.566
-She redid all this.
-Oh, yeah.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.235
-So I think it's good.
-Mm.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.198
Hey.

23:28.281 --> 23:31.201
What are you two doing here together?

23:31.284 --> 23:33.120
We came to inspect the new curtains.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.872
Yeah, and the fancy new, uh, entrance,

23:35.956 --> 23:37.457
both great additions.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.878
Well, I wanted to spruce the place up
before I have an appraiser come in,

23:41.962 --> 23:44.506
and Skeeter gave me a great deal.

23:44.589 --> 23:48.135
But that's not at all why you're here,
so let's just get to it.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.388
Dana Sue, you should be
very excited to see us.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.057
-Yeah, we could make your night.
-Mm-hmm.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.310
Oh boy. That sounds like the kinda thing

23:57.394 --> 23:59.646
that starts off with you
asking me for a favor

23:59.729 --> 24:03.817
and ends up with me running from the law,
changing my name, and moving to Quebec,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.861
and I don't wanna be
around anything French.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.655
Except cassoulet.
And poodles. I like a poodle.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.824
I bet the cassoulet
is really good in Quebec.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.286
You know, I heard it's better in Paris.
Have you been to Paris, Cal?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.621
As a matter of fact, I have.
Even went in the springtime.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.206
Oh, I love Paris in the fall.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.252
Can I please overnight you both to Paris
and put you out of my misery?

24:22.335 --> 24:24.880
Would that interfere with me
buying Micah out of the restaurant?

24:24.963 --> 24:25.881
It would.

24:25.964 --> 24:26.965
Oh, shame.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.134
My, uh, financial adviser

24:29.634 --> 24:33.263
is always telling me
to diversify my investments.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.434
Besides, I have dinner often enough here.
Should find a way to make some of it back.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.020
It's a good deal.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.939
A great one, actually,

24:43.023 --> 24:45.025
and you'll be protected
every step of the way.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.986
-But--
-It fixes your financial problem.

24:48.069 --> 24:51.740
And more importantly,
it doesn't involve you-know-who.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.784
Unless you've decided that you want it to.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.786
You don't wanna talk
about your you-know-who.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.163
I don't have to talk about mine.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.541
Do… do y'all need a minute, or--

25:01.625 --> 25:03.126
-Dana Sue, come here.
-Okay.

25:03.627 --> 25:08.256
I know this is completely out of the blue,
but I would urge you, consider his offer.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.216
Thank you, Helen.

25:09.299 --> 25:13.094
Yeah, I mean, I will.
I will. I'm sorry, I'm just…

25:13.970 --> 25:17.098
Okay, heavenly days, here we go!

25:17.182 --> 25:21.269
Cal, this is so generous of you
and so unexpected.

25:21.353 --> 25:25.023
Okay, I would absolutely love
to sit down and talk through with you

25:25.106 --> 25:27.108
what all of this would mean.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.610
But?

25:29.277 --> 25:31.029
I have to go.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.782
I have a date.

25:34.491 --> 25:37.118
-Oh! With… Yes.
-Oh!

25:37.202 --> 25:41.081
Okay, well…
By all means, go. Go! Go! Have fun!

25:41.164 --> 25:42.541
-You and me…
-Yes, have fun.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.042
-Okay.
-Go. Go.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.503
-Enjoy your little… Whoo!
-My, my. Partnerships abound!

25:50.715 --> 25:54.636
Dana Sue said she was sending over dinner.
This looks like it's the whole kitchen.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.305
Mom can get a little carried away
caring for people.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.808
And when it's people she loves, look out!

26:01.017 --> 26:03.770
Please let Mom and me know
if there's anything else you need.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.105
You're so sweet. Thank you.

26:06.565 --> 26:10.485
Oh! I'm sure Kyle would like to see you
before you go. He's in the family room.

26:12.153 --> 26:12.988
Okay.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.372
Hey, Kyle. How's it going?

26:24.749 --> 26:26.376
Already doing my summer reading.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.588
Wow, I don't even look at mine
until August.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.630
You're busy.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.969
Mom sent over some pot roast.

26:36.052 --> 26:39.973
Fried chicken, scalloped potatoes,
brownies, and pecan pie.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.141
All your favorites.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.601
Thank you.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.646
When do you get to ditch the chair?
Everybody's asking.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.772
Everybody?

26:48.440 --> 26:51.693
School, Sullivan's, church. People.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.655
I didn't realize
people were talking about me.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.741
Oh, they're not. Not like that.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.576
They're just worried about you.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.503
I should definitely sign your cast.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.339
-You don't have to.
-I want to.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.340
Why?

27:13.423 --> 27:15.091
That's what friends do, isn't it?

27:15.175 --> 27:18.720
I'm not Evan Hansen. I don't need you
to pretend to be my friend.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.473
I'm not. We <i>are</i> friends, Kyle.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.894
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
That's what we are.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.189
Friends. Only friends, just friends.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.443
Such good friends that you drop me
to hang out with somebody else.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.946
Anybody else 'cause I'm not Ty or Simon
or whoever you'd rather hang with.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.573
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is!

27:39.115 --> 27:42.994
I have friends who don't pretend!
I have friends who actually care about me!

27:43.078 --> 27:44.162
I don't need you!

27:44.704 --> 27:45.622
Kyle!

27:48.875 --> 27:50.794
Why would you talk to her like that?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.462
You don't know what she did--

27:52.545 --> 27:55.256
No, you're right! I don't know.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.134
So tell me! What happened between you two?

27:58.218 --> 27:59.803
Come on, let's go take a walk.

28:01.012 --> 28:05.684
Kyle Walter Townsend,
this is not the answer.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.567
Honey! Maddie! Hold up, dear.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.444
What is wrong with him?!

28:17.362 --> 28:18.738
I… I don't know.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.866
All I know is that it's gonna take time

28:21.950 --> 28:24.369
and patience for him
to reach the other side.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.079
Why won't he let me in?

28:26.162 --> 28:30.041
I'm his mother. It's my job to help him.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.751
Oh, my sweet girl,

28:32.794 --> 28:34.421
if it were only that easy.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.882
I wish that we could wipe away
every tear our babies cry

28:37.966 --> 28:39.342
or kiss the hurt away.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.846
I… I wish we could keep our children
from falling.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.433
But, Maddie, we can't.

28:47.058 --> 28:52.313
Kids are gonna fall,
and that's what happened to Kyle.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.356
He fell.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.318
And you can't pull him up
until he's ready,

28:57.402 --> 28:59.195
no matter how much you want to.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.905
And the more you try,

29:01.948 --> 29:04.325
the more he is gonna pull you down
with him.

29:04.909 --> 29:11.249
All you can do is stand there,
waiting, with love and attention.

29:11.332 --> 29:15.420
He has to be the one to decide
that he wants to stand up.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.922
That's not your job.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.383
-Your job…

29:22.427 --> 29:25.430
…is to love him the way I love you.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.495
What's that one?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.372
-That's your head line.
-Oh.

29:51.998 --> 29:55.084
Granny'd take one look at yours
and say you are a smart woman.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.880
Sounds like she was one too.

29:59.714 --> 30:00.590
Yeah.

30:01.090 --> 30:01.925
This…

30:02.008 --> 30:02.842
Mm-hmm.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.970
…is your heart line.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.516
It's telling me
you have a lot of love to give.

30:10.975 --> 30:11.935
Does it now?

30:12.727 --> 30:16.439
And this is your

30:17.524 --> 30:20.401
"maybe you should come home with me" line.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.614
-It speaks for itself.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.034
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.766
I don't wanna know
what your granny'd have to say about that.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.601
-Ah…

31:02.235 --> 31:03.069
Um…

31:04.070 --> 31:07.282
Oh. We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.451
Oh, I do.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.497
But I just have a lot on my mind.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.961
Lately, between Annie
and the restaurant and money stuff,

31:20.044 --> 31:23.840
people who think they have the answers,
and people making my life miserable…

31:26.009 --> 31:28.177
Bet my head line
didn't say anything about all that.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.181
Come here.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.608
When I go home with you…

31:44.527 --> 31:45.820
I wanna be present.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.115
Truly with you.

31:51.075 --> 31:55.830
And right now, I've got so much going on

31:55.914 --> 32:00.084
that I don't think I can be,
and that is not fair to you.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.507
How can being honest not be fair?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.430
Thank you.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.410
Helen.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.163
Hi, Trotter.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.873
I see you're working.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.209
You look positively serious.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.211
How concerned should I be?

32:43.294 --> 32:45.838
Oh, no, I just need
a moment of your time, and I…

32:47.590 --> 32:50.468
I should make an appointment.
Do I call? How would you like to do this?

32:50.551 --> 32:53.513
Sit down right this minute
because you're making me nervous.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.601
Um…

32:58.685 --> 32:59.644
What's going on?

33:00.269 --> 33:02.063
Can we talk about adoption?

33:03.773 --> 33:06.943
-Excuse me?
-I… I know. It's crazy, isn't it?

33:07.026 --> 33:11.030
But Ashley and I
have been talking about this, in theory,

33:12.240 --> 33:13.116
forever.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.160
I… I think we're finally ready
to get serious.

33:19.914 --> 33:23.960
I would happily be your lawyer
for such a beautiful reason.

33:24.794 --> 33:25.795
Yeah?

33:25.878 --> 33:27.922
Yeah!

33:37.056 --> 33:40.435
-You made this one too, didn't you?
-How'd you know?

33:41.019 --> 33:43.396
Well, the curlicue here on the G.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.773
-Plus, I can actually read yours.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.067
Thanks.

33:48.151 --> 33:52.196
It's nice to make someone laugh
instead of people laughing <i>at</i> me.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.243
-Thanks for what you said before.

33:57.827 --> 34:01.205
People not there when something happened
have no business talking about it.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.582
Much less laughing about it.

34:08.212 --> 34:12.008
It… it sucks that people
said bad things about you because of me.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.469
People can be complete idiots.

34:21.017 --> 34:23.102
But people can learn.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.410
Hey, beautiful.

34:41.788 --> 34:42.872
Congratulations.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.458
For what?

34:46.292 --> 34:48.377
Finishing your first year of teaching.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.420
How did it go?

34:50.379 --> 34:52.673
If I can grade all these finals
without going blind,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.383
then it will be a success.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.887
When you get back from State,
we will have to go out and celebrate.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.597
Separate from celebrating State.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.433
-It's a lot of celebrating.
-There's a lot to celebrate.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.560
-Mm.
-It's been a big year for you.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.271
It has. For Ty too.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.399
Uh, sorry he's not gonna get to go
with us to State.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.235
Yeah, no, I know.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.822
He's heartbroken he can't play
after he worked so hard all season.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.949
-Can I give you these?
-Sure.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.993
No, I meant
I'm sorry he can't come as team captain.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.579
Look what he did at the Castlewood game.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.748
He's our leader,
whether on the mound or in the dugout.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.083
It's not what he told me.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.920
Oh, well, maybe he's just trying to put on
a brave front for me.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.214
I'm sure he's worried
about disappointing you.

35:34.590 --> 35:38.094
Well, he shouldn't be. Oh God, I hope
he didn't think I was pressuring him.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.097
I was just trying to point out
he still has so much to offer the team.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.015
At least that's what I was trying to do.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.560
No, and I'm sure you did. It's just…

35:46.227 --> 35:47.145
He's overwhelmed.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.480
He broke his arm.
His brother was in a car accident.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.815
Everyone's nerves are just shot.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.942
He's just not ready
to be away from Serenity.

35:54.986 --> 35:55.820
I get it.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.282
Sorry. I misread the situation.

36:02.827 --> 36:03.786
I'm sorry.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.540
I, uh… I talked to a clerk at MVR

36:07.623 --> 36:11.544
and a colleague
who's doing family law down in Jackson,

36:12.295 --> 36:16.591
and I just don't know how likely we are
to get access to your birth records.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.176
Oh.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.678
Since your adoption was closed,

36:20.761 --> 36:24.724
the State isn't required
to release any additional information,

36:25.224 --> 36:27.727
and neither of your birth parents
have signed up

36:27.810 --> 36:29.437
for mutual consent registries

36:29.520 --> 36:32.190
that would allow you to connect with them.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.108
But don't worry.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.903
It simply means
that we're just gonna have to hunt down

36:36.986 --> 36:39.655
some other ways
to get the information that we need.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.532
Okay.

36:41.616 --> 36:45.661
Before we go any further,
um, I do have a question.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.872
I hear the way
you talk about your parents,

36:47.955 --> 36:50.917
and it doesn't seem like
you're trying to fill some kind of void.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.043
Absolutely not.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.045
Then if you don't mind me asking,

36:55.630 --> 36:56.881
why do you wanna know?

37:04.305 --> 37:08.684
I've seen adoptees on Reddit
say they wanna know medical history,

37:10.144 --> 37:13.397
which… maybe one day,
that'll be important.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.900
No, no. I know, you're 22.
You're gonna live forever.

37:22.531 --> 37:25.785
I had a great childhood.
The three of us were…

37:26.494 --> 37:28.412
My mom and dad were the best.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.249
The best.

37:33.334 --> 37:37.964
Mom is why I dance and play basketball.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.091
She introduced me to <i>Wizard of Oz</i>

37:40.174 --> 37:41.801
and Peg Leg Bates.

37:42.885 --> 37:47.139
I love coffee
and Buster Keaton movies, like Dad.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.977
-He's where I get my sense of humor.
-Hm.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.981
And he also taught me
how to balance a checkbook,

37:55.064 --> 37:57.692
which he swears
is gonna be important one day.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.403
-Hey, you listen to him.

38:00.486 --> 38:05.449
They taught me how to stand up for myself,
what passion and sacrifice look like.

38:05.533 --> 38:09.912
I am who I am not because of DNA…

38:11.247 --> 38:12.999
…but because of their values.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.336
Because of their love.

38:19.588 --> 38:25.511
Believe me when I say
that I know just how damn lucky I was

38:26.470 --> 38:28.556
that the adoption agency found them.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.935
They found them for me!

38:35.938 --> 38:38.566
I couldn't have been
as fortunate with my birth parents.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.651
They gave me up for a reason.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.946
I don't need to know why.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.032
I just wanna know who.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.537
Whose eyes are staring back at me

38:53.039 --> 38:55.833
every single time I look in the mirror?

38:57.251 --> 38:58.544
Hey, Isaac.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.846
Annie? My Annie?

39:08.929 --> 39:10.765
No, I know. It blindsided me too.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.767
Oh, okay. Did Kyle ask her out,

39:12.850 --> 39:16.896
or did he just tell her he had a crush
in whatever ham-handed way boys do that?

39:16.979 --> 39:17.855
I couldn't tell.

39:17.938 --> 39:20.649
Even though I heard the fight,
he would not tell me any more about it.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.860
I can't believe
she didn't say anything.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.904
I thought we'd gotten past
the secret-keeping.

39:24.987 --> 39:28.699
Mm. I can remember a lot of secrets
that we kept from our moms at that age.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.410
-Ugh.
-Mm-hmm. Well, who says we've stopped?

39:31.494 --> 39:33.162
Exhibit Mr. You-Know-Who.

39:33.245 --> 39:36.040
-Dana Sue.
-Helen, when are you gonna tell him?

39:36.123 --> 39:39.293
Well, I think he's made his position
on the subject crystal clear.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.837
Well, true, but, I mean… …really,

39:41.921 --> 39:46.050
like, if he knew that he was going to be
a dad, he might change his mind.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.052
And that is exactly what I don't want.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.137
Elaborate!

39:52.598 --> 39:54.975
I have loved Ryan for years,

39:55.684 --> 39:59.397
and I have dreamed
about having babies with him.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.191
But he doesn't wanna have kids,

40:02.274 --> 40:06.904
and I can finally see that,
and… I accept that.

40:08.739 --> 40:12.743
Okay, but if he knew
it were his, maybe--

40:12.827 --> 40:15.496
He'd do it out of duty
and not out of love.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.124
Helping Isaac has made
one thing very clear to me,

40:18.207 --> 40:20.918
that no child should have a parent
who only cares for them

40:21.001 --> 40:22.294
because they're supposed to.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.338
They should have a parent who loves them

40:24.422 --> 40:27.299
and… and wants them
more than anything else in the world.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.593
That's how I feel
about this little blessing.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.178
Yeah.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.013
Ryan doesn't, so fine.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.474
-So you're not gonna tell him?
-Mm.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.892
At some point, I will.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.020
But not yet.
And not until I'm good and ready.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.981
-Mmm.
-Well, all right, then.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.401
Well, we are here for you
whenever that day comes.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.819
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!

40:48.904 --> 40:49.780
Let's eat.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.490
-Hm.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.618
Oh! Speaking of Isaac,
did the two of you find anything?

40:54.702 --> 40:55.661
No.

40:55.744 --> 40:57.580
But I wish I could have met his mom.

40:57.663 --> 41:01.000
She sounds like she was
an extraordinary woman. His dad too.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.589
Well, since Helen hasn't found anything
through official channels,

41:06.672 --> 41:10.092
Maddie, you and I need to comb
through the juicy stuff.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.386
You always love that juicy stuff.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.681
Oh, talk to your mom. Maybe there was
some adult gossip that we missed

41:15.764 --> 41:18.350
because we were too innocent
for that kind of thing.

41:18.434 --> 41:21.896
When were you ever innocent,
Miss Second-Grade-Easter-Basket-Thief?

41:21.979 --> 41:23.731
-Okay, I will ask her.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.484
She is pretty much living at my house
right now to help with Kyle,

41:26.567 --> 41:28.027
so that should be easy.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.153
How are the kids doing?

41:29.236 --> 41:32.198
I mean, Katie's fine,
but Kyle, I just…

41:32.740 --> 41:34.992
I don't know. I can't get through to him.

41:35.075 --> 41:39.663
He's so wounded and angry. It…
I really don't even know what to do.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.708
-Does he need to see a professional?
-What do you mean, like a therapist?

41:42.791 --> 41:44.043
I do.

41:44.126 --> 41:47.213
Well, I… I mean, I can handle this myself.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.758
Your powers are many and mighty,
my dear, but they're not limitless.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.260
-Did you set Ty's broken arm?
-Well, of course not.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.888
Mmm. Then why are you trying
to set Kyle's broken spirit?

41:55.971 --> 41:58.474
Because we all grew up
with that same refrain,

41:58.557 --> 42:00.184
"Only crazy people see shrinks."

42:00.267 --> 42:03.145
We also grew up
with, "Go outside with wet hair

42:03.229 --> 42:04.313
and catch pneumonia,"

42:04.396 --> 42:07.149
and, "Plant potatoes under a full moon."

42:07.233 --> 42:09.610
-No, that one's true.
-I actually think you're right.

42:09.693 --> 42:10.528
I hear you.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.531
And Ty? How's he handling things?

42:13.614 --> 42:16.700
He's a trouper.
I mean, he's handling it better than I am.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.410
Annie would be a mess, working overtime

42:18.494 --> 42:22.331
to make me think she had control
over everything to keep me from worrying.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.627
Like Helen's saying,
you can't solve every problem by yourself.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.921
But you can solve your restaurant's?

42:29.004 --> 42:30.339
Oh!

42:30.422 --> 42:31.799
-Touché.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.676
Still, lean on us.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.593
Thank you.

42:35.135 --> 42:38.138
I am certainly gonna lean
on the two of you when this baby comes.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.433
-You two, Erik, heck, probably even Cal.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.978
You're gonna be
the only people keeping me sane

42:44.061 --> 42:46.355
the first time I gotta deal
with a colicky newborn.

42:46.438 --> 42:48.899
Oh, we are so here for it.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.943
Especially if it involves margaritas.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.653
Dana Sue!

42:52.736 --> 42:54.238
Not for the baby!

42:54.321 --> 42:59.076
I meant for me and you when we take turns
with the baby so Helen can sleep.

43:00.119 --> 43:03.998
Can't believe you'd think I'd even suggest
giving the baby a margarita!

43:04.081 --> 43:05.457
We're not gonna do that

43:06.041 --> 43:07.543
till the baby's first birthday party.

43:07.626 --> 43:10.170
-You're not allowed to babysit.
-Speaking of.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.172
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Yeah.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.058
A Paula Vreeland original.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.229
For a Helen Decatur original.

43:29.481 --> 43:31.191
Oh my twinkling stars.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.694
Didn't your grandmamas
ever teach you ladies

43:33.777 --> 43:35.696
not to make a pregnant woman cry?

43:37.364 --> 43:39.408
We're having a baby!

43:48.208 --> 43:49.293
Oh shoot.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.921
-You want some help?
-No, I got it.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.715
-Are you sure?
-No.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.636
Here, let me help you.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.598
-Just be careful.
-Oh, does it hurt?

44:02.681 --> 44:04.266
-No.
-Okay.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.184
Thanks.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.103
I know this has been a tough week,

44:08.187 --> 44:10.606
and I just wanna thank you
for how you've been handling it.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.191
What else am I supposed to do?

44:12.274 --> 44:14.693
Hm. Have a bad attitude.

44:15.277 --> 44:17.071
Make me do everything for you.

44:19.490 --> 44:23.160
Break down into such big tears,
Nana's gotta walk you around the block.

44:23.827 --> 44:27.539
Instead, you've been pitching in,
helping out with your brother.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.667
You have been moving forward.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.839
Which makes me wonder
why you didn't wanna go to State.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.894
Did you say you didn't wanna go to State
because of me?

44:49.478 --> 44:54.441
You've just been through so much
with Kyle and Dad, and it just…

44:56.443 --> 44:57.945
felt like the right thing to do.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.408
Come here.

45:07.413 --> 45:11.250
So, every time Gaynell
gets me under the hair dryer,

45:11.333 --> 45:12.835
and I got no place to go,

45:13.460 --> 45:14.586
she starts talking.

45:15.212 --> 45:19.133
She goes on and on about all of the things
that she got from her mama.

45:19.717 --> 45:25.264
Like her high cholesterol,
good taste in men, her childbearing hips--

45:25.347 --> 45:27.641
-Oh my God.
-Okay, sorry.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.643
You know what she never talks about?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.728
Nobody does?

45:31.812 --> 45:35.107
It's all the things that our kids
<i>didn't </i>inherit from us,

45:35.607 --> 45:36.900
like fear.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.405
Tyler…

45:44.950 --> 45:51.165
…you are brave and fearless
every single day,

45:51.248 --> 45:52.416
and I am not.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.255
That's just one of the bazillion things
that I love about you.

46:00.466 --> 46:03.218
Do not ever let me catch you

46:04.470 --> 46:07.514
making a decision to accommodate my fear.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.557
You got that?

46:09.808 --> 46:10.642
Yes, ma'am.

46:13.187 --> 46:14.021
So?

46:14.813 --> 46:16.315
I wanna go to State.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.108
Good.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.613
-You wanna go call your coach?
-You wanna go call your boyfriend?

46:26.658 --> 46:27.826
-Chef.
-Mm?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.495
Thank you.

46:29.995 --> 46:30.829
For what?

46:30.913 --> 46:32.623
For helping me feel at home here.

46:33.248 --> 46:35.417
Well, sweetie, you are.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.461
Because you convinced people to like me.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.881
Uh, no. Oh my goodness.

46:40.964 --> 46:43.675
I mean, I don't have that power.
I wish I did, but I don't.

46:43.759 --> 46:47.387
You do. I mean,
you may not realize it, but you do.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.057
You made Helen
wanna help me find my birth parents.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.392
No! No, no, no, no.

46:52.476 --> 46:56.980
Helen, Maddie, Erik, Annie, me,
heck, the whole restaurant,

46:57.064 --> 47:00.567
we adore you because of who you are.

47:01.401 --> 47:06.240
You're sweet and dedicated,
and you have a peculiarly dry wit.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.534
-Not once it's marinated overnight.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.996
We love you
because you are a part of this community.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.498
You run out of your way to--

47:14.581 --> 47:16.792
Yes, because that's what community does.

47:17.751 --> 47:22.631
Okay? Whether it's baked goods or a visit
or helping you find your birth parents,

47:22.714 --> 47:27.469
I mean, maybe even an early morning hug.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.264
Yes. Yeah.

47:30.931 --> 47:33.267
I promise we're gonna find them.

47:36.812 --> 47:39.064
Is that part of the preopening ritual?

47:39.147 --> 47:40.941
-Only if you're lucky.
-Oh.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.776
We've got something for you.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.570
Now, we might have gone overboard,

47:44.653 --> 47:47.948
but there's no overboard
with food and teenage boys, is there?

47:48.031 --> 47:48.866
Yeah.

47:48.949 --> 47:51.994
Cookies, cupcakes, brownies

47:52.995 --> 47:54.788
for the road to victory.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.833
All sprinkled with good luck
and meant to be shared.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.585
Oh, these are fantastic.

47:59.668 --> 48:01.587
The guys are gonna love it. Thank you.

48:01.670 --> 48:02.921
Anytime,

48:03.005 --> 48:04.089
partner.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.428
Wait, really? Awesome!

48:09.511 --> 48:11.805
Oh, okay. You know
what you're getting yourself into, right?

48:11.889 --> 48:15.309
This is not some kind of investment
where you're gonna watch your money grow

48:15.392 --> 48:19.062
at a fixed rate every week.
This is ups and downs, fat and lean.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.898
And she doesn't mean just the beef.

48:22.524 --> 48:28.155
My financial adviser has a portfolio
of things he's put my money into,

48:28.655 --> 48:30.741
all just entries on a spreadsheet.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.994
But this restaurant, you…

48:36.705 --> 48:40.083
You don't get to make money with someone
you care about very often, do you?

48:40.709 --> 48:42.586
Isn't that what you and Helen told Maddie

48:42.669 --> 48:44.379
when you were convincing her
to open the spa?

48:45.631 --> 48:48.300
Yeah, I thought
that wisdom sounded familiar.

48:48.383 --> 48:49.801
-Yeah.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.262
You set the rules, I'll follow.

48:53.055 --> 48:54.473
The most silent of partners.

48:57.809 --> 48:59.019
Glad you're on board.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.523
Now, if you wanna name something
on the menu after me,

49:03.607 --> 49:04.816
totally fine with that.

49:04.900 --> 49:08.320
-Shortstop Short Ribs, coming up.
-Ah.

49:09.279 --> 49:13.742
All right. All right, now get outta here
and go win that championship, you hear me?

49:13.825 --> 49:15.494
-Yes, ma'am.

49:15.577 --> 49:17.120
-Go, Bulldogs!

49:37.849 --> 49:40.352
I didn't know what happened
between you and Annie.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.233
That must have hurt.

49:50.362 --> 49:53.615
But you are not gonna feel better
unless you talk about it.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.576
I'm booking you
an appointment with a therapist.

49:57.244 --> 49:58.495
I… I don't need that.

49:58.578 --> 49:59.913
You gotta talk to someone.

50:00.414 --> 50:02.040
And if it's not gonna be me,

50:03.917 --> 50:05.377
it's gonna be a professional.

50:40.454 --> 50:41.413
Hey.

50:42.789 --> 50:43.707
Um…

50:45.751 --> 50:47.002
Got a minute to talk?

50:51.006 --> 50:52.090
Hm.
