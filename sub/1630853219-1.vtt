01:04.530 --> 01:06.272

01:54.690 --> 01:57.553
<i>after my roommates left.</i>

01:57.589 --> 02:01.322
<i>But a lot of free time</i>
<i>and a lot of free space</i>

02:01.358 --> 02:04.393

02:08.100 --> 02:11.266

04:42.316 --> 04:43.823
Ooh!

04:45.490 --> 04:48.056
I didn't burn this one,
I swear it.

04:48.092 --> 04:49.760
I promise.

04:49.795 --> 04:53.897
So, um, you gonna take these
decorations down any time soon?

04:53.932 --> 04:55.961
Um...

04:55.996 --> 04:59.106
I was gonna wait
until you cave and do it.

04:59.141 --> 05:01.074
Oh, okay, yeah,
that sounds about right.

05:01.110 --> 05:03.339
I like it.
Christmas in January.

05:03.374 --> 05:04.670
-Thank you.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.243
-It's cute.
-Okay, yeah.

05:06.278 --> 05:07.975
-I'm just saying.
-Mm-hmm.

05:09.717 --> 05:11.011
Hey.

05:11.983 --> 05:13.019
What?

05:13.054 --> 05:14.617
I asked if anybody wanted any.

05:14.653 --> 05:17.182
I just wanted a little.
Don't be so defensive.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.989
Defensive.

05:20.024 --> 05:21.292
Scooch!

05:21.328 --> 05:22.621
Um, there's just not
really room.

05:22.657 --> 05:23.795
Oh, okay.
Do you mind?

05:25.629 --> 05:27.132
Oh, what, is this
not comfortable?

05:27.168 --> 05:29.499
-How about this?
-Oh, okay, sure.

05:29.534 --> 05:31.334
-It's your funeral.
-Oh!

05:31.370 --> 05:33.371
-Stop!
-There are feet on me...

05:33.406 --> 05:34.534
-No, I can't-- you know I can't.
-Mm-hmm.

05:34.570 --> 05:35.769
...that belong to Amanda.

05:35.804 --> 05:37.008
Do you think you're
gonna survive?

05:37.043 --> 05:38.635
-Um, no.
-Yeah?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.138
-Yeah?
-No.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.948
-It's not super fun?
-Stop it, stop, it, stop it.

-Hi, this is Terese Jackson.

06:34.899 --> 06:38.338
I was just calling to get
a refill on my Creon.

06:38.373 --> 06:44.610
Um, you can reach me back
at 513-555-6322.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.611
Thank you!

<i>I've had a lung disease</i>

<i>I think I know</i>

07:09.505 --> 07:11.802
I mean, when do you think
classes will be back?

07:11.837 --> 07:13.865
I don't know, everyone's saying,
like, two, three weeks.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.334
-Yeah, okay.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.550
How are we gonna protect you?

07:27.352 --> 07:29.120
I don't know.

07:29.156 --> 07:31.155
Hey, hey, it's okay.

07:31.191 --> 07:32.917
We're here for you.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.388
I just-- I don't wanna do this.

07:35.423 --> 07:36.530
I know.

07:40.593 --> 07:41.898
Hey.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.500
We can do this.
Okay?

07:44.535 --> 07:46.798
No one here is getting COVID.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.575
I simply won't allow it.

07:51.303 --> 07:54.146
Yeah, it's all about
the mindset, right?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.345
Just have to manifest it.

07:56.381 --> 07:57.675
I mean, we're in LA.

08:02.390 --> 08:05.053
I think I could maybe
survive COVID.

08:07.157 --> 08:10.157
I think we
can do better than maybe.

08:17.634 --> 08:19.434
<i> I hate being high-risk</i>

08:19.469 --> 08:20.904
<i>in the pandemic.</i>

08:21.835 --> 08:23.199
<i>Makes it a lot harder</i>

08:23.235 --> 08:26.011
<i>to pretend to be</i>
<i>a normal person.</i>

08:37.188 --> 08:39.283
Hey...

08:39.319 --> 08:41.958
<i> Hey, honey.</i>
<i>Are you busy right now?</i>

08:42.560 --> 08:45.960
I haven't been busy in months.

08:45.996 --> 08:48.196
<i> You know there's a way</i>
<i>to fix that.</i>

08:48.565 --> 08:49.829
Oh, my God.

08:49.865 --> 08:51.699
You found a cure
for Coronavirus.

08:51.734 --> 08:54.163
Mom, have you notified The Post?

08:54.199 --> 08:56.706
<i> Ha-ha.</i>
<i>No!</i>

08:56.741 --> 08:58.178
<i>But you know I would</i>
<i>if I could,</i>

08:58.213 --> 09:00.708
<i>anything to keep you safe.</i>

09:00.743 --> 09:02.644
<i>But I meant finding a job?</i>

09:02.679 --> 09:04.344
<i>Something to fill your time.</i>

09:04.379 --> 09:07.481
<i> Wow, that took her all</i>
<i>of one minute to bring up.</i>

09:07.517 --> 09:09.150
<i>New record.</i>

09:11.356 --> 09:12.557
Yeah, I know.

09:12.592 --> 09:14.020
It's just that jobs
aren't exactly

09:14.055 --> 09:16.558
flying off the shelves
right now, so...

09:16.594 --> 09:18.564
<i> Right.</i>
<i>Well...</i>

09:18.599 --> 09:20.425
<i>What are you gonna do</i>
<i>with your life?</i>

09:21.300 --> 09:22.834
I don't know.

09:25.970 --> 09:28.367
It's just-- it's the end
of the world right now.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.572
The world is literally ending,
and no one is really

09:30.607 --> 09:32.811
thinking long-term so...

09:34.743 --> 09:37.248
<i>The world's not ending.</i>

09:37.283 --> 09:38.880
<i>It's on pause.</i>

09:38.916 --> 09:41.516
<i>And so is your ambition,</i>
<i>apparently.</i>

09:41.552 --> 09:42.851
<i>How's your health?</i>

09:42.886 --> 09:44.090
<i>I know you've been</i>
<i>staying safe,</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:45.690
<i>which is great.</i>

09:45.726 --> 09:47.794
<i>I'm already anxious enough</i>
<i>thinking of what</i>

09:47.829 --> 09:50.560
<i>CF is doing to your lungs</i>
<i>without COVID in the mix.</i>

09:50.596 --> 09:52.932
<i>But are you feeling all right?</i>

09:52.968 --> 09:55.029
I'm fine.

09:55.065 --> 09:56.528
<i> Have you been doing</i>
<i>your treatments?</i>

09:56.564 --> 09:58.299
Yep.

09:58.334 --> 10:00.463
<i> Do they still have you</i>
<i>on the inhaled albuterol?</i>

10:00.499 --> 10:02.641
<i>Because I remember</i>
<i>your doctor saying that</i>

10:02.676 --> 10:04.773
<i>that really helps to get</i>
<i>all the mucus up</i>

10:04.809 --> 10:06.613
<i>when you do it</i>
<i>with the vest.</i>

10:06.648 --> 10:08.371
<i>Gotta imagine that's</i>
<i>more important than ever</i>

10:08.406 --> 10:10.382
<i>since you're so inactive</i>
<i>nowadays.</i>

10:10.418 --> 10:12.048
<i>With so much free time, honey,</i>

10:12.083 --> 10:15.581
<i>your health really should be</i>
<i>your top priority.</i>

10:15.616 --> 10:19.616
<i>I know it's, like, weird times</i>
<i>right now and everything...</i>

10:19.651 --> 10:22.327
<i> Sometimes, I feel</i>
<i>like I'm patient first</i>

10:22.362 --> 10:24.357
<i>and daughter second.</i>

10:29.370 --> 10:30.831
<i>Her nagging just makes me</i>

10:30.866 --> 10:32.672
<i>wanna do my treatments less.</i>

10:32.707 --> 10:35.806
<i>Even when she's a four-hour</i>
<i>plane ride away.</i>

10:35.841 --> 10:37.574
<i>I know they're important,</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>

10:37.609 --> 10:39.842
<i>but it's not like I'm gonna die</i>

10:39.877 --> 10:43.443
<i>if I don't do them</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

10:43.478 --> 10:45.846
<i>It's hard to be proactive</i>
<i>when it doesn't feel like</i>

10:45.881 --> 10:48.150
<i>there's any future to plan for.</i>

11:16.750 --> 11:20.013
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

11:20.049 --> 11:22.283
Holy fuck.
Are you waving at me?

11:23.348 --> 11:25.015
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

11:25.051 --> 11:27.150
Why am I doing that?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.092
Why am I waving like that?

11:37.205 --> 11:38.733
<i>Oh, my God, hi!</i>

11:38.768 --> 11:41.705
<i>Wee!</i>
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

11:41.740 --> 11:44.410
<i>-I've missed your face.</i>
-Aww.

11:44.445 --> 11:46.476
I miss you.
I miss everyone.

11:46.511 --> 11:47.743
I miss everything.

11:47.778 --> 11:49.977
<i>I mean, I even miss Tyler.</i>

11:50.012 --> 11:52.046
<i>-Don't kill me, okay?</i>
-Okay.

11:52.081 --> 11:53.419
We might be getting
back together.

11:56.390 --> 11:58.588
Okay!
Honestly...

11:58.624 --> 12:00.392
Get it where you can, sis.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.660
I can't even hate on you.

12:01.695 --> 12:03.726
The last time--
I can't even recall

12:03.761 --> 12:05.488
the last time I've been touched,

12:05.523 --> 12:08.194
even non-sexually,
by another person.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.903
<i> You're being</i>
that<i> strict?</i>

12:11.604 --> 12:14.266
Yeah.
What are you doing?

12:14.302 --> 12:17.335
-<i> I mean, nothing crazy.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.108
<i>Julia and Miguel come</i>
<i>over a lot.</i>

12:19.144 --> 12:21.907
<i>Sometimes, I hang out</i>
<i>with Steph and Trish.</i>

12:21.942 --> 12:24.416
<i>Oh, and Jackson.</i>

12:24.451 --> 12:26.711
<i>And, of course, Tyler.</i>

12:26.747 --> 12:28.116
Mm.

12:28.151 --> 12:30.887
<i> Look-- I--</i>
<i>I wanna do my part</i>

12:30.923 --> 12:32.623
<i>to, like, stop</i>
<i>the spreading stuff,</i>

12:32.658 --> 12:34.726
<i>but I feel like we're young;</i>

12:34.761 --> 12:37.790
<i>we can afford</i>
<i>a few more risks.</i>

12:37.825 --> 12:39.397
Yeah, pfft.

12:39.432 --> 12:41.093
We-- I mean, yeah.

12:41.129 --> 12:43.096
Like, we're young.

12:43.132 --> 12:44.968
<i>My friend's mom,</i>
<i>she has cancer,</i>

12:45.003 --> 12:48.370
<i>so imagine what she</i>
<i>has to go through.</i>

12:48.405 --> 12:51.205
<i>-I mean, she can't see</i>
<i>absolutely anybody...</i>

12:51.240 --> 12:52.846
<i>-She has to...</i>

12:56.814 --> 12:58.148
Terese?

12:59.253 --> 13:00.410
Uh, yeah.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.718
I guess we need
some house rules.

13:02.753 --> 13:04.583
What are you thinkin'?

13:04.619 --> 13:07.150
Uh, well, everything they're
recommending to the public

13:07.186 --> 13:08.958
but to the extreme.

13:08.993 --> 13:11.264
Like, I don't wanna
take any risks.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.226
What does that mean?

13:13.261 --> 13:15.400
Don't go anywhere,
don't see anyone,

13:15.436 --> 13:17.128
increased hygiene...

13:17.163 --> 13:18.595
We can't leave?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.072
Unless it's absolutely,
completely necessary.

13:24.842 --> 13:27.045
Well, what counts as necessary?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.749
Where are you trying to go?

13:29.784 --> 13:31.885
Everything is either cancelled
or closed.

13:33.281 --> 13:35.684
Well, how long
is this gonna last?

13:35.719 --> 13:37.550
How should I know?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.826
Have you thought
about going home?

13:46.861 --> 13:48.500
No.
No.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.865
I'd go crazy with my mom.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.402
I am...
Going home.

13:54.138 --> 13:56.508
My mom doesn't want me
staying in the city.

13:56.543 --> 13:57.909
I know, dude.
Same.

13:57.944 --> 14:00.843
My mom was texting me, like,
25 times<i> today.</i>

14:00.878 --> 14:03.981
Wait, so we're just on lockdown?

14:04.016 --> 14:06.348
Like, I can't even go see
my boyfriend?

14:07.183 --> 14:09.383
I mean, we can factor
Zack in as well.

14:09.419 --> 14:12.550
But I don't think anyone
should be going in or out.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.321
So what, I'm like a prisoner
in this house,

14:15.356 --> 14:17.793
and I can't even see
my boyfriend?

14:17.828 --> 14:20.124
I'm just saying for now.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.960
Until we know more.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.237
Please...

14:24.273 --> 14:26.833
Well, how long?

14:26.869 --> 14:28.640
I don't know.

14:28.675 --> 14:30.968
I don't know, and I wish I did.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.440
I do.

14:33.842 --> 14:35.077
But I don't.

14:35.112 --> 14:37.374
Well, if you're gonna
be like that,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.377
then I obviously
can't stay here.

14:39.413 --> 14:42.249
Um, maybe I can go stay
with Zack.

14:42.284 --> 14:44.551
This is not about
how I'm gonna be.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.057
This is what I have to do.

14:47.093 --> 14:49.594
This pandemic means way
different things for me

14:49.629 --> 14:51.756
than it does for you.

14:53.529 --> 14:56.497
Well, the world doesn't revolve
around you, Terese.

15:06.712 --> 15:08.509
I don't want it to.

15:21.658 --> 15:23.119
Oh, God.

15:23.154 --> 15:24.364
Amanda?

15:24.399 --> 15:26.456
-Hey!
-Hey!

15:26.492 --> 15:28.598
What are you doing here?

15:28.634 --> 15:31.070
Um, I live here.

15:31.105 --> 15:33.765
Except you haven't lived here
for, like, a while now.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.834
Well, I still pay rent.

15:37.808 --> 15:40.437
Right.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.609
Uh, how are you and Zack doing?

15:43.675 --> 15:46.784
Uh, it's been better.
We just...

15:47.120 --> 15:50.381
needed a little break,
close quarters and all.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.650
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.654
Oh, it's no big deal.
We'll get through it.

15:57.096 --> 15:58.797
So why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

16:00.629 --> 16:03.630
Sorry, I didn't know
I needed to ask permission.

16:07.605 --> 16:09.234
Um...

16:09.270 --> 16:12.474
You've really nested here.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.506
Yeah, well, a little heads up
would have been nice.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.547
-I would have cleaned.
-Mm-hmm.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.789
<i>This should be interesting.</i>

16:33.563 --> 16:36.297
<i>I mean, how can she</i>
<i>just come back?</i>

16:36.332 --> 16:38.872
<i>Like things are</i>
<i>any different now.</i>

16:38.907 --> 16:40.368
<i>I guess I have</i>
<i>to give her a chance.</i>

16:40.403 --> 16:41.940
<i>It's not like I can</i>
<i>just kick her out,</i>

16:41.975 --> 16:44.701
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>where she's been.</i>

16:44.737 --> 16:46.109
<i>She could have been</i>
<i>playing beer die</i>

16:46.144 --> 16:49.039
<i>with Zack's bros,</i>
<i>for all I know.</i>

16:49.075 --> 16:51.717
<i>Although beer die is probably</i>
<i>the easiest drinking game</i>

16:51.752 --> 16:53.316
<i>to social distance during.</i>

16:53.352 --> 16:58.058
<i>But-- </i> <i> -- still,</i>
<i>I don't like this.</i>

16:59.826 --> 17:01.626
I just love Julianne Moore.

17:01.661 --> 17:04.323
She was so pretty.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.726
I mean, she's still beautiful.

17:08.097 --> 17:09.635
Yeah, but not like this.

17:09.671 --> 17:11.236
That's kind of fucked up.

17:11.271 --> 17:15.033
That's like the ageist bullshit
Hollywood always spins.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.439
Whatever.

17:21.110 --> 17:23.472
Ope, she's gonna die.

17:23.508 --> 17:25.414
What?
Spoilers!

17:25.449 --> 17:28.484
I have never seen this movie
before in my life.

17:28.519 --> 17:31.056
All I'm saying is when
a character coughs in a movie,

17:31.091 --> 17:32.650
it's foreshadowing that
they're gonna, like,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.952
die of cancer, or AIDS,
or something.

17:36.087 --> 17:38.422
As if the first sign of cancer
or AIDS is a cough--

17:38.458 --> 17:40.496
Shh-- I'm trying to watch.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.609
<i> It's a pretty</i>
<i>foolproof system.</i>

17:57.644 --> 18:01.087
<i>If a character coughs,</i>
<i>they die.</i>

18:01.123 --> 18:03.414
<i>Maybe that's why people</i>
<i>are always so concerned</i>

18:03.449 --> 18:05.718
<i>when I causally cough.</i>

18:05.753 --> 18:08.590
<i>It's been subconsciously</i>
<i>ingrained into them</i>

18:08.625 --> 18:11.527
<i>that it means I'm gonna, like,</i>
<i>die or something.</i>

18:12.659 --> 18:16.268
<i>And I am, but not,</i>
<i>like, soon...</i>

18:17.438 --> 18:18.736
<i>I think.</i>

18:47.529 --> 18:48.831
Don't you think
that's kind of creepy?

18:48.867 --> 18:50.770
Jesus, Amanda!

18:50.805 --> 18:53.371
Just saying.
You're drooling.

18:55.106 --> 18:56.237
You should shoot your shot.

18:56.272 --> 18:57.604
Oh, my God.
It's a pandemic.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.836
I can't just go around
dating random dudes.

18:59.871 --> 19:01.907
You could do it
from a distance.

19:01.942 --> 19:04.916
Oh, my God, it would be
like<i> Five Feet Apart.</i>

19:04.951 --> 19:06.846
Okay, that's really insensitive.

19:06.881 --> 19:09.984
And also, no it wouldn't
because he doesn't have CF.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.224
How do you know?

19:12.455 --> 19:16.328
Because it would just be
way too ironic.

19:18.997 --> 19:20.359
Where are you going?

19:20.394 --> 19:22.327
Just getting a coffee.

19:22.363 --> 19:23.998
Do you have a mask?

19:24.034 --> 19:25.965
Duh!
Look.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.108
All I'm saying is if you're
so starved for a relationship,

19:29.143 --> 19:31.141
you have the perfect
potential man gardening

19:31.177 --> 19:32.537
on the other side
of this duplex.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.609
-Whatever!

19:34.644 --> 19:37.343
And also, I'm not starved
for a relationship.

19:37.378 --> 19:39.112
I just want some dick!

19:43.652 --> 19:45.522
God, I really hope
he didn't hear that.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.921
Then again...

20:01.005 --> 20:02.737
-Hey.
-Hey!

20:06.738 --> 20:09.645
So, um, I think just maybe

20:09.680 --> 20:13.484
we should be, um, limiting
how much we're going out.

20:14.779 --> 20:16.751
I mean, I just got a coffee,

20:18.123 --> 20:20.554
For the third time this week.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.559
Terese, don't worry.
I'm being careful.

20:23.857 --> 20:27.124
Okay, can you just wash
your hands please?

20:28.234 --> 20:30.366
Yeah, I was going to.
I just got home.

20:30.401 --> 20:32.734
Just give me the chance to.
Okay?

20:38.941 --> 20:41.444
<i> She barely even told me</i>
<i>she was coming back,</i>

20:41.480 --> 20:45.051
and the reason she left
hasn't changed at all.

20:45.086 --> 20:47.018
And I feel like
I'm gonna get COVID,

20:47.053 --> 20:49.055
and it's gonna be all her fault.

20:49.090 --> 20:52.352
<i>Ooh, okay.</i>
<i>That's a little extreme.</i>

20:53.055 --> 20:55.092
Yeah, I can't help but
feel she's being irresponsible

20:55.127 --> 20:57.262
and she's going outside though.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.525
<i>But you can't know</i>
<i>how she's acting.</i>

21:00.560 --> 21:02.268
Exactly.
That's my issue.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.303
I feel like I've lost
all control with her back.

21:05.339 --> 21:08.636
<i>Well, I know how you like</i>
<i>your control.</i>

21:08.671 --> 21:11.443
<i>Have you tried talking</i>
<i>to her about it?</i>

21:12.470 --> 21:14.170
Yes.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.609
<i>No, I mean</i> actually<i> talking</i>
<i>to her about it.</i>

21:17.644 --> 21:20.076
<i>Like setting ground rules,</i>

21:20.112 --> 21:23.119
<i>making your standards</i>
<i>explicitly clear.</i>

21:23.154 --> 21:25.224
I guess you're right.

21:25.259 --> 21:27.727
I just, like-- my anxiety's
running my life.

21:27.762 --> 21:31.122
<i>And it can be...</i>

21:32.460 --> 21:35.491
<i>Overwhelming when...</i>

21:35.526 --> 21:39.669
<i>you let your anxiety consume</i>
<i>the people around you as well.</i>

21:40.634 --> 21:42.165
Wait, is that how you felt?

21:42.200 --> 21:45.640
Is that why you, like, you
left earlier than...

21:45.676 --> 21:49.076
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>My mom made me come home.</i>

21:49.111 --> 21:50.243
<i>Um...</i>

21:50.278 --> 21:52.482
<i>But yeah.</i>

21:52.518 --> 21:54.552
<i>Like, I did feel that way</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

21:56.048 --> 21:57.851
<i>I-- I didn't mind it</i>
<i>too much though</i>

21:57.886 --> 22:00.454
<i>because I know how important</i>
<i>this is for you.</i>

22:00.489 --> 22:02.956
<i>Amanda knows you have CF.</i>

22:02.992 --> 22:06.531
<i>But I don't think she</i>
<i>understands what that means.</i>

22:07.697 --> 22:10.331
<i> But she's just</i>
<i>a sub-leaser.</i>

22:11.632 --> 22:13.102
A sub-leaser who's gonna be here

22:13.137 --> 22:14.834
for the next year.

22:14.869 --> 22:17.608
Just tell her.
It'll make your life easier.

22:34.389 --> 22:36.089
-Hey.
-Hey!

22:36.925 --> 22:39.523
So I just-- uh, I just wanted
to talk to you.

22:40.026 --> 22:43.797
Um, I guess you should know
about me.

22:43.832 --> 22:46.529
Well, since we're gonna be
living together,

22:46.565 --> 22:49.066
I just...

22:49.101 --> 22:53.369
Um, I thought
you should know that, um...

22:55.048 --> 22:58.044
I have Cystic Fibrosis.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.021
Oh.

23:02.056 --> 23:03.321
Yeah, no, yeah.
It's not--

23:03.356 --> 23:06.558
It's not a big deal or anything.
Um...

23:06.593 --> 23:09.327
It's just, like, you might see
some, like, equipment,

23:09.362 --> 23:13.059
uh, laying around
or, like, just...

23:15.131 --> 23:16.469
Okay.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.500
Yeah!
Uh, yeah.

23:20.535 --> 23:22.440
Cool.
Well...

23:22.475 --> 23:27.342
Now that you know,
that is a cool fun fact

23:27.377 --> 23:28.443
that you know about me.

23:28.479 --> 23:30.106
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

23:30.141 --> 23:32.510
That's a really good juice,
that.

23:32.546 --> 23:34.280
See ya later.

23:36.656 --> 23:40.015
It's just like it's so much
easier being alone.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.527
<i> You sure?</i>

23:42.757 --> 23:45.630
<i>But you're not alone anymore.</i>

23:53.766 --> 23:55.798
-Hey.
-Mm.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.202
What's up?

23:59.310 --> 24:01.107
This.

24:01.942 --> 24:03.908
Looks like we have
the same idea.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.947
Since when are you
a big drinker?

24:07.246 --> 24:10.347
Quarantine has a tendency
to change things.

24:11.592 --> 24:14.318
Can you just, um,
wipe that down though please?

24:15.093 --> 24:16.826
Uh, okay.

24:24.602 --> 24:26.065
Yeah, can you just
maybe thorough--

24:26.101 --> 24:29.242
Terese, look-- I'm not
irresponsible or anything.

24:29.277 --> 24:31.338
Can you stop watching me
like a hawk?

24:31.374 --> 24:32.774
Okay, I'm sorry.

24:32.810 --> 24:34.742
I don't mean to be, like,
backseat cleaning,

24:34.777 --> 24:36.648
but I just-- I realized
we haven't had

24:36.683 --> 24:39.118
a proper conversation
about COVID safety procedures

24:39.153 --> 24:40.751
since you've been back, and I--

24:40.786 --> 24:44.280
I really just do need
a little bit more from you.

24:44.315 --> 24:46.492
What, do you want me
to get tested more?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.360
Sure, I mean, getting tested
more would be great,

24:48.395 --> 24:50.428
but by the time
you tested positive,

24:50.463 --> 24:51.660
you would have
already exposed me.

24:51.695 --> 24:52.958
And I'm just trying
to think of ways

24:52.994 --> 24:55.194
we can both avoid exposure
in general.

24:56.163 --> 24:58.366
For me, best practice is
to kind of overreact,

24:58.401 --> 25:01.870
and with CF, it--

25:01.905 --> 25:04.638
like, I just-- I have to be
at a higher alert

25:04.673 --> 25:07.344
for this kind of stuff, so...

25:07.379 --> 25:10.808
It just makes me really anxious.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.116
Yeah.
I can tell.

25:19.419 --> 25:22.021
I realize I should have said
this right when you got back,

25:22.057 --> 25:24.658
but I just need you to be
at the same level

25:24.693 --> 25:26.399
of precaution as me or it--

25:26.434 --> 25:29.261
it's just kind of all
for nothing then.

25:31.668 --> 25:34.396
Okay.
So what are the rules?

25:34.432 --> 25:36.372
Okay, well everything that comes
into the house

25:36.407 --> 25:37.638
has to be wiped down.

25:37.673 --> 25:39.402
I mean, sanitized completely.

25:39.438 --> 25:42.137
Sanitize your hands.
Wash your hands right after.

25:42.172 --> 25:44.142
Leave all the bags in the trash.

25:44.177 --> 25:45.876
Make sure that you always have
gloves on

25:45.911 --> 25:47.553
whenever you're outside.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.312
Sanitize the gloves
when you have the chance.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.417
Keep your mask on.

25:50.452 --> 25:51.686
I know it...

25:57.794 --> 26:00.091
<i>That was definitely expired.</i>

26:00.127 --> 26:01.757
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have</i>
<i>finished it.</i>

26:05.371 --> 26:06.401
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

26:06.437 --> 26:07.906
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

26:07.941 --> 26:09.738
<i>Okay.</i>

26:09.773 --> 26:12.537
<i>Amanda said...</i>
<i>to shoot my shot.</i>

26:12.572 --> 26:13.907
<i>Right?</i>

26:13.942 --> 26:15.410
<i>I mean, I guess</i>
<i>it couldn't hurt.</i>

26:15.446 --> 26:17.815
<i>What do I say...?</i>

26:20.316 --> 26:21.819
Hey!

26:22.923 --> 26:24.451
Hey.

26:24.487 --> 26:25.850
Uh, how are you?

26:27.092 --> 26:28.557
Lonely.

26:28.592 --> 26:30.958
All alone in this apartment.

26:30.994 --> 26:33.632
Respecting quarantine
to the highest level.

26:33.667 --> 26:36.031
I could really use someone
to keep me company.

26:37.669 --> 26:39.364
Do you know anyone
who's available?

26:40.338 --> 26:42.268
Anyone at all?

26:45.508 --> 26:47.143
What?

26:47.845 --> 26:49.646
I said, "Did you hear
about the protests?"

26:49.681 --> 26:51.416
They're happening down
the street.

26:51.452 --> 26:53.077
Oh, that is what--
yeah, that's--

26:53.113 --> 26:54.546
that is definitely
what you said.

26:54.581 --> 26:56.584
Um, yes!

26:56.619 --> 26:57.914
Are you going to that?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.483
Yeah!
Are you?

27:00.590 --> 27:02.756
No.
No, 'cause I--

27:02.791 --> 27:05.187
just 'cause I'm, like, so busy,

27:05.223 --> 27:08.330
and like, my schedule is<i> packed!</i>

27:08.365 --> 27:09.894
Ridiculous.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.737
This girl's got emails.

27:13.035 --> 27:14.737
Yeah, no, that sounds
really cool though.

27:14.772 --> 27:17.039
Uh, and I hope you have
a lot of fun.

27:19.547 --> 27:22.506
You're plants look
really good...right now.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.642
And your hair.
You left.

27:30.454 --> 27:32.489
<i>Fun?</i>
<i>Fun.</i>

27:32.524 --> 27:34.193
<i>Why did I say fun?</i>

27:34.228 --> 27:36.187
<i>Protests aren't fun.</i>

27:36.222 --> 27:38.760
<i>They are important</i>
<i>and necessary,</i>

27:38.795 --> 27:40.861
<i>-but they aren't fun.</i>

27:40.897 --> 27:42.492
<i>Although I guess</i>
<i>I wouldn't know</i>

27:42.527 --> 27:44.328
<i>because my fear</i>
<i>of catching COVID and dying</i>

27:44.363 --> 27:47.201
<i>has kept me from attending,</i>
<i>but God--</i>

27:47.236 --> 27:50.169
<i>now he probably thinks</i>
<i>I am this terrible person</i>

27:50.204 --> 27:52.841
<i>with my packed</i>
<i>fucking schedule, like,</i>

27:52.877 --> 27:55.504
<i>"Sorry, no time to fight</i>
<i>for justice.</i>

27:55.540 --> 27:58.382
<i>I have to pretend</i>
<i>to respond to emails."</i>

Jesus, I didn't know
you were there.

28:36.122 --> 28:37.680
Mm-hmm.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.221
Were you gonna wipe those down
like we talked about?

28:41.393 --> 28:43.724
Yeah, I just--

28:43.759 --> 28:45.721
I got in, and I just--

28:46.861 --> 28:49.297
I forgot.
I'm sorry.

28:49.799 --> 28:52.162
It's just so much to remember.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.999
It's a lot sometimes, I know.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.000
Then why do you do it?

28:57.035 --> 28:58.736
Because I have to.

28:59.639 --> 29:02.847
But you said it yourself;
you're kind of overreacting.

29:02.882 --> 29:05.408
I mean, wiping my fruit down
just doesn't seem

29:05.444 --> 29:07.245
like it should be
that big of a deal.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.345
Well, it is.
The small things matter.

29:21.596 --> 29:25.602
It's just like she makes me feel
like I'm being the selfish one.

29:25.637 --> 29:29.270
It's not fun for me, you know?

29:31.977 --> 29:34.138
<i>Do you think she got it?</i>

29:34.173 --> 29:36.112
<i>Like, when you explained CF</i>

29:36.148 --> 29:39.610
<i>and the COVID dangers</i>
<i>and all that a little bit more?</i>

29:40.751 --> 29:42.448
Maybe I should just go home.

29:44.190 --> 29:45.616
<i>Really?</i>

29:46.318 --> 29:49.287
Why, is it a bad idea?

29:49.323 --> 29:52.524
<i>You were just always</i>
<i>so against it.</i>

29:57.035 --> 29:58.967
Yeah, but if there's anyone
who won't flack me

29:59.002 --> 30:01.038
for my control issues,
it's my mom.

30:01.969 --> 30:03.469
Learned from the best.

30:10.878 --> 30:12.676
What the fuck?

30:16.521 --> 30:17.621
I saw your story.

30:17.656 --> 30:19.481
Did you go to a restuarant?

30:19.517 --> 30:21.118
Oh, yeah.
Didn't it look so good?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.088
Why would you do that?

30:23.123 --> 30:24.925
Well, I went to go get take-out

30:24.960 --> 30:26.657
but decided I wanted it hot.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.232
It doesn't matter.
It's not safe.

30:31.565 --> 30:34.498
Well, if it weren't safe,
why would they be open?

30:34.534 --> 30:37.140
Because the American government
is incompetent?

30:37.175 --> 30:39.444
Because the economy has been
deemed more important

30:39.479 --> 30:41.078
than people's health?

30:43.378 --> 30:45.280
Well, you don't even care
about your health.

30:50.152 --> 30:51.952
What are you
talking about?

30:51.987 --> 30:53.783
You smoke every single day.

30:54.593 --> 30:56.692
Okay.
And?

30:56.728 --> 30:58.026
I slack on my treatments,

30:58.062 --> 30:59.556
and I might not take
my meds every day,

30:59.591 --> 31:01.360
but that's kind of none
of your business.

31:01.396 --> 31:03.669
Well, I just think
it's a little hypocritical

31:03.704 --> 31:05.133
that you yell at me
for going out

31:05.168 --> 31:06.904
when you don't even take care
of yourself.

31:06.939 --> 31:09.464
My slacking on a long-term
treatment plan

31:09.500 --> 31:11.136
is nowhere near
the same thing

31:11.171 --> 31:13.742
as not wanting to die of COVID.

31:13.778 --> 31:15.538
But I remember you saying

31:15.573 --> 31:17.573
you thought you
could survive COVID.

31:17.608 --> 31:20.150
Yeah.
I was probably being hopeful.

31:21.118 --> 31:23.313
And it's not just
about surviving it.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.755
You know, I could probably live

31:24.791 --> 31:27.124
but my lungs
would never recover.

31:30.025 --> 31:32.255
I-- I didn't think that--

31:32.290 --> 31:34.394
Yeah.
You didn't.

31:34.429 --> 31:37.562
Amanda, you should probably
go back to Zack's

31:37.598 --> 31:40.170
and just make both
of our lives easier if you can--

31:48.714 --> 31:49.845
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't--

31:49.880 --> 31:51.776
I don't mean to kick you out.

31:51.811 --> 31:54.517
It's just, like, if you can't
take this seriously, then...

31:54.552 --> 31:55.784
No.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.886
I can't go back to Zack's.

31:57.921 --> 32:01.257
The break is kind of indefinite.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.863
We got in a big fight and...

32:07.898 --> 32:09.263
I thought it was just a break,

32:09.298 --> 32:13.029
but he hasn't called or texted
or anything.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.502
So maybe you should call him.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.378
No.
I'm not ready for that.

32:20.414 --> 32:22.514
Um, 'cause...

32:22.983 --> 32:25.985
what if he answers
and confirms that it's over?

32:26.617 --> 32:28.116
Yeah, yeah.

32:28.151 --> 32:31.048
Take your time,
do what you need to do

32:31.084 --> 32:33.150
to get over him.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.458
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:34.493 --> 32:37.563
And, Amanda,

32:37.598 --> 32:40.628
stick to take-out-- please.

32:40.663 --> 32:42.133
Okay.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.509
<i> Hello?</i>

32:52.545 --> 32:54.480
Hey, it's me.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.405
<i>Hi, honey!</i>
<i>Ah!</i>

32:56.440 --> 32:58.380
<i>What a nice surprise.</i>

32:59.784 --> 33:02.016
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

33:02.052 --> 33:05.651
Yes, I'm fine.
I was just...

33:06.794 --> 33:09.259
calling, um,
'cause I was wondering

33:09.294 --> 33:13.289
what it would, like, be like
if I were to come home.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.999
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Really?</i>

33:15.034 --> 33:17.460
<i>Well, I would love to have you,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

33:17.495 --> 33:19.296
<i>But why?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:19.331 --> 33:21.998
Um...nothing, I'm fine.

33:22.033 --> 33:26.276
I was just thinking it'd be nice
to have a change of pace.

33:27.574 --> 33:30.043
<i>Okay, sure.</i>
<i>Well, that's exciting.</i>

33:30.078 --> 33:31.707
<i>I could use the company.</i>

33:31.743 --> 33:34.019
<i>Makes me wish</i>
<i>I'd had another kid.</i>

33:34.055 --> 33:36.885
<i>Now, hun, you'll have</i>
<i>to pay for an extra bag</i>

33:36.920 --> 33:39.188
<i>to bring your vest in.</i>

33:39.223 --> 33:41.126
<i>Are you stocked up</i>
<i>on all your meds?</i>

33:41.161 --> 33:43.621
<i>We could just re-order things</i>
<i>once you get here.</i>

33:43.656 --> 33:45.964
<i>So you don't have</i>
<i>to lug 'em all over.</i>

33:46.000 --> 33:48.664
<i>Are you still on Trikafta?</i>
<i>Because that's--</i>

33:48.700 --> 33:51.197
Yeah, I was just

33:51.232 --> 33:53.170
thinking, like, hypothetically.

33:53.205 --> 33:57.474
Um, I don't think
I would wanna leave LA yet.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.069
Sorry.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.739
<i>Aww.</i>

34:00.774 --> 34:02.679
<i>You know you're always</i>
<i>welcome here, sweetheart.</i>

34:02.714 --> 34:04.314
Yeah, I know, Mom.

34:21.398 --> 34:23.199
<i>Sure he looks like</i>
<i>the perfect man,</i>

34:23.234 --> 34:27.001
<i>but he could be, like,</i>
<i>a serial killer</i>

34:27.036 --> 34:30.668
<i>or worse-- a scorpio.</i>

34:30.704 --> 34:33.640
<i> Only one way</i>
<i>to find out though.</i>

34:36.207 --> 34:39.976
<i>I'd love it if my bangs could</i>
<i>just not look like barcodes.</i>

34:40.717 --> 34:42.154
<i>Gross.</i>

34:50.628 --> 34:51.893
Hey!

34:51.928 --> 34:53.429
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:53.464 --> 34:55.093
-Oh, whoa, sorry, six feet.
-Oh, right, six feet.

34:56.129 --> 34:57.536
How are you?

34:57.571 --> 34:59.470
I'm good, ya know?

34:59.506 --> 35:01.600
I just...

35:01.635 --> 35:04.236
Making like a plant
and photosynthesizing.

35:04.271 --> 35:05.709
Aren't we all?

35:05.744 --> 35:07.077
We're all plants.

35:07.112 --> 35:09.538
So glad to see
that you're a plant guy

35:09.573 --> 35:11.242
'cause I'm a plant girl.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.541
-Really?
-Yes!

35:12.577 --> 35:13.814
Wow, what's your favorite?

35:13.850 --> 35:16.616
Oh, um...

35:16.651 --> 35:18.614
Just so many, I can't even
remember the names.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.124
-It's, like, crazy.
-I know.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.894
The names are hard.
I just like the shapes.

35:21.929 --> 35:23.553
-The shapes are cool.
-Yeah, yeah.

35:23.588 --> 35:25.894
-I love your plants.
-Thanks!

35:25.930 --> 35:27.129
They're super sick.

35:27.165 --> 35:28.758
How long have you
been doing this?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.662
Oh, just from the start
of quarantine.

35:30.697 --> 35:32.462
No way, I would've thought
this was, like,

35:32.497 --> 35:33.761
a many years endeavor.

35:33.797 --> 35:35.635
-No, no, just started.
-Wow.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.931
I think they're
looking pretty good.

35:36.967 --> 35:38.769
I gotta cut a couple
in the back but...

35:38.804 --> 35:40.570
<i> I wish it</i>
<i>weren't a pandemic</i>

35:40.605 --> 35:43.279
<i>so I could just ask him out.</i>

35:43.315 --> 35:45.245
<i>I guess that's not stopping</i>
<i>some people,</i>

35:45.281 --> 35:48.319
<i>but I'm not just some people.</i>

35:56.223 --> 35:58.128
<i>Yes.</i>

35:58.164 --> 36:01.326
<i>Yo, why would anyone</i>
<i>ever use a bowl?</i>

36:01.361 --> 36:02.924
<i>This is so efficient,</i>

36:02.959 --> 36:05.567
<i>and it doesn't dirty</i>
<i>any dishes.</i>

36:06.871 --> 36:08.807
<i>Bowl, bowl.</i>

36:08.842 --> 36:10.869
<i>Should I smoke another bowl?</i>

36:19.013 --> 36:20.049
Mm.

36:20.085 --> 36:21.611
<i>Spoons are like small shovels.</i>

36:21.646 --> 36:23.288
<i>I never thought about that.</i>

36:33.362 --> 36:35.662
<i>Where are you going?</i>

36:35.697 --> 36:38.567
<i>What would you have</i>
<i>to look that nice for?</i>

36:45.708 --> 36:47.939
<i>What if she's going</i>
<i>to see someone?</i>

36:55.854 --> 36:57.420
<i>No.</i>

36:57.456 --> 36:59.858
<i>I'm way too high to talk</i>
<i>about this right now.</i>

36:59.893 --> 37:01.752
<i>I don't want any smoke tonight.</i>

37:01.788 --> 37:04.153
<i>-Except the weed kind.</i>

37:24.146 --> 37:25.179
<i>Hmm.</i>

37:25.214 --> 37:26.851
<i>She's been gone a while.</i>

37:28.487 --> 37:31.217
Yeah, she's, like,
really strict, so...

37:38.491 --> 37:39.925
Who the fuck is that?

37:44.297 --> 37:45.934
I'm Sean.

37:45.970 --> 37:47.697
Hi.
Shut up.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.303
And get the fuck
out of my house.

37:49.339 --> 37:51.275
-Terese.
-No, keep the mask on!

37:51.310 --> 37:53.535
Why are you still here?
Get out of my house!

37:53.570 --> 37:55.814
Now, please.

37:55.849 --> 37:58.649
What the-- who was that?

37:58.685 --> 38:01.544
Um...Sean.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.779
Sean.
Sean who?

38:03.814 --> 38:06.017
I don't know.
I met him...

38:07.990 --> 38:09.121
online.

38:10.425 --> 38:12.798
You did not go on a Tinder date

38:12.833 --> 38:14.663
in a fucking pandemic.

38:14.698 --> 38:16.558
You told me to do what I had
to do to get over Zack.

38:16.593 --> 38:17.995
Oh, my God.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.764
I meant, like, drink
a bottle of vodka and cry,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.339
like egg his house,
harass him online,

38:21.374 --> 38:24.904
not bring some<i> fucker</i> named Sean
into my house!

38:25.470 --> 38:27.407
Our house.

38:27.443 --> 38:29.440
You're right.
I am so sorry.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.839
We both live here.

38:30.874 --> 38:32.680
You just put us both at risk!

38:32.716 --> 38:35.615
For what, stilted conversation
and a quick fuck?

38:35.650 --> 38:38.922
Amanda, in what world
was this okay?

38:39.558 --> 38:41.589
We've only talked about, like,
wiping things down

38:41.624 --> 38:43.286
-and sticking to takeout...
-Oh, my God.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.822
I thought the "not mingling
with strangers" was implicit.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.593
He tested negative last week.

38:48.628 --> 38:51.369
He tested negative last week?

38:51.405 --> 38:53.766
Anything could've happened
within that last week,

38:53.801 --> 38:56.170
especially if he's going out
on random dates

38:56.205 --> 38:57.770
during a pandemic!

38:57.806 --> 38:59.845
Well, we weren't, like,
coughing on each other.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.473
Are you a fucking idiot?

39:01.509 --> 39:02.607
Are you a fucking idiot?!

39:02.643 --> 39:04.174
I know you're
from Arizona,

39:04.209 --> 39:06.275
but I thought you understood,
like, simple science.

39:09.083 --> 39:12.217
You're acting like I want
to give you COVID or something.

39:12.919 --> 39:16.625
You're not trying very hard
to prevent it.

39:16.661 --> 39:19.330
You can go out and be reckless
and irresponsible

39:19.365 --> 39:21.199
and probably get away with it
scot-free,

39:21.234 --> 39:22.899
but if you bring COVID
into this house,

39:22.934 --> 39:24.535
I could die.

39:31.940 --> 39:35.612
A ventilator may have always
been part of my future,

39:36.943 --> 39:39.515
but if you're going
to live here with me,

39:39.550 --> 39:40.852
I need you to make sure
it doesn't become

39:40.888 --> 39:42.916
part of my present.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.787
Okay.

39:46.751 --> 39:49.120
CF is a lung disease.

39:50.087 --> 39:54.492
If I get COVID,
I could be done for.

39:54.528 --> 39:56.666
This is so serious.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.062
I'm sorry.

39:59.098 --> 40:02.037
This must be so hard for you.
I can't imagine.

40:03.909 --> 40:05.301
Well try to.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.409
And we need to both quarantine
in our rooms

40:09.445 --> 40:11.912
until you can get tested.

40:26.399 --> 40:28.929
<i> As if I weren't</i>
<i>confined enough.</i>

41:33.791 --> 41:35.160
Hey.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.499
Don't worry.

41:37.535 --> 41:39.335
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

41:39.370 --> 41:41.963
that my test came back negative.

41:41.998 --> 41:44.138
That's lucky.

41:44.173 --> 41:45.472
Yeah.

41:45.507 --> 41:47.606
And for what it's worth,

41:47.642 --> 41:50.373
Sean also tested negative.

41:50.408 --> 41:53.183
He sent me a screenshot
when he asked me out again.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.851
Well, have fun with that.

41:57.522 --> 41:59.789
I'm not gonna go out
with him again.

42:00.724 --> 42:04.255
You were right.
It was a stupid thing to do.

42:05.330 --> 42:08.094
I was just so upset over Zack.

42:09.730 --> 42:11.697
But I finally called him,

42:11.732 --> 42:14.567
and we had a really good talk.

42:14.602 --> 42:16.568
Uh, we're back together.

42:16.603 --> 42:19.500
Or still together.

42:19.536 --> 42:22.739
But I think I'm gonna start
staying there again.

42:22.775 --> 42:24.372
Oh, that is so good!

42:24.407 --> 42:26.712
I-- that-- that's so good
for you guys.

42:26.747 --> 42:30.054
Like, I'm so happy for you guys.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.420
-Wow.
-Yeah.

42:31.455 --> 42:34.057
Um, I think it's for the best.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.756
Yeah.

42:35.791 --> 42:39.093
I'm sorry I made you feel
so unsafe.

42:39.762 --> 42:41.600
I don't wanna
stress you out anymore.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.766
Plus I miss him so much.

42:44.801 --> 42:47.531
It is so hard being lonely
in these times.

42:49.934 --> 42:52.006
Don't I know it.

42:52.774 --> 42:54.837
Okay.
Uh, I'm gonna go pack.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.945
Yes, yeah.
Go pack.

42:58.481 --> 43:00.443
Go-- go pack, girl.

43:08.660 --> 43:11.190
-I'm gonna head out.
-Okay, cool.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.360
-Bye.
-Bye.

<i>How are you?</i>

45:02.504 --> 45:04.039
Terrible.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.971
There's nothing to watch.

45:07.006 --> 45:09.207
<i>Oh, so it's, like, really</i>

45:09.242 --> 45:11.376
<i>the end of the world then,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

45:13.111 --> 45:15.083
Yeah, no, what do I watch?

45:15.118 --> 45:19.323
<i>Maybe you shouldn't keep</i>
<i>binging into eternity, hm?</i>

45:19.359 --> 45:22.052
What else is there to do?

45:22.088 --> 45:25.390
<i>Uh, you could pick up a hobby.</i>

45:28.229 --> 45:31.431
Like crocheting or knitting,
like some retiree?

45:31.466 --> 45:32.698
<i>Maybe?</i>

45:32.733 --> 45:34.566
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

45:34.601 --> 45:35.837
Nope.

45:35.872 --> 45:37.538
Binge-watching things
is my hobby.

45:37.573 --> 45:39.104
<i>No, it's not.</i>

45:39.139 --> 45:41.443
<i>It's an avoidance</i>
<i>of productivity.</i>

45:41.479 --> 45:43.714
How profound of you.

45:43.750 --> 45:46.584
I didn't know our therapy
session was today.

45:46.620 --> 45:48.580
-It's not even Tuesday!
<i>-It is Tuesday.</i>

45:48.615 --> 45:49.881
<i>So...</i>

45:49.916 --> 45:51.412
Okay.
You're right.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.456
This is why you
are my therapist.

46:00.795 --> 46:03.023
Why aren't you rising?

46:32.931 --> 46:34.564
<i> Maybe I should have</i>
<i>asked Sydney</i>

46:34.599 --> 46:36.965
<i>before I painted her table.</i>

46:37.000 --> 46:39.095
<i>Whatever.</i>
<i>It looks sick as fuck now.</i>

46:39.130 --> 46:40.634
<i>She's gonna love it.</i>

47:07.062 --> 47:09.494
<i>I have been coughing</i>
<i>more lately.</i>

47:13.496 --> 47:15.135
<i>Makes it kind of hard to deny</i>

47:15.170 --> 47:17.537
<i>that I really need</i>
<i>to do my treatments.</i>

47:18.577 --> 47:20.434
<i>It only takes 30 minutes.</i>

47:20.470 --> 47:23.337
<i>I mean, just, you know, do it.</i>

47:23.372 --> 47:25.514
<i>Just pick it up and...</i>

47:26.552 --> 47:28.953
Bagel Bites.
Bagel Bites.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.291
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

47:33.326 --> 47:35.784
<i>That is amazing.</i>

47:37.191 --> 47:40.061
I know he lost,
but he's just so cute.

47:40.096 --> 47:42.063
<i>And you said</i>
<i>you couldn't find a hobby.</i>

47:42.099 --> 47:44.200
Yeah, well this one is getting
dangerous though

47:44.235 --> 47:48.740
because I'm painting, like,
anything I can get my hands on:

47:48.775 --> 47:51.805
mugs, almost did the wall
the other day...

47:51.840 --> 47:53.169
Oh, my God, furniture.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.946
<i>Uh, your furniture?</i>

47:56.340 --> 47:58.313
Okay, so I have a gift for you.

47:58.348 --> 48:00.015
<i>Yeah, Terese if that shit</i>
<i>doesn't look like it came</i>

48:00.051 --> 48:02.082
<i>straight out of a Pier 1</i>
<i>Imports catalogue,</i>

48:02.117 --> 48:04.353
<i>your ass is off the lease,</i>
<i>so...</i>

48:05.622 --> 48:07.418
I'm off the lease.

48:15.801 --> 48:18.331
<i>Whoa, are you--</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

48:18.366 --> 48:20.666
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I just cough when I laugh.

48:22.203 --> 48:26.273
<i>Well, that's not normal,</i>
<i>is it?</i>

48:26.309 --> 48:27.940
I don't know, maybe I'm just,
like, coming down

48:27.976 --> 48:30.242
with a cold or something.

48:30.278 --> 48:33.382
<i>But you don't think</i>
<i>that it's...?</i>

48:33.417 --> 48:34.843
COVID?

48:37.647 --> 48:40.750
Um, I hadn't thought
about that.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.063
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>CF Center, this is Angela.</i>

48:51.098 --> 48:52.937
Hi.
This is Terese Jackson.

48:52.972 --> 48:55.100
<i> Hey, Terese.</i>
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

48:55.135 --> 48:56.132
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

48:56.168 --> 48:58.405
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

48:58.441 --> 49:02.203
Well, I-- I do have, like,
a bit of an increased cough

49:02.239 --> 49:03.545
as of recently.

49:03.580 --> 49:04.947
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

49:04.983 --> 49:06.748
<i>Have you had any fever</i>
<i>or headaches</i>

49:06.783 --> 49:08.215
<i>associated with it?</i>

49:08.250 --> 49:12.083
Um, maybe a few headaches,
but no fever.

49:12.118 --> 49:14.455
<i> That I know of.</i>

49:14.490 --> 49:17.252
<i> Have you lost your</i>
<i>sense of taste or smell at all?</i>

49:17.287 --> 49:18.789
<i>Any diarrhea?</i>

49:18.825 --> 49:20.293
No.

49:20.329 --> 49:22.297
<i> Okay, then</i>
<i>it's likely not COVID,</i>

49:22.333 --> 49:24.794
<i>but you should probably</i>
<i>get tested just to be safe.</i>

49:24.829 --> 49:26.804
<i>And definitely let us know</i>
<i>if you start having</i>

49:26.839 --> 49:28.096
<i>any fevers</i>
<i>or trouble breathing.</i>

49:28.131 --> 49:29.699
Okay.

49:29.735 --> 49:31.072
<i> Try to increase</i>
<i>your airway clearance...</i>

49:31.107 --> 49:32.804
<i> What if I do</i>
<i>have COVID?</i>

49:32.839 --> 49:34.804
<i> ...and definitely make</i>
<i>sure you're staying hydrated.</i>

49:49.895 --> 49:52.525
<i>I do have a few</i>
<i>of these symptoms.</i>

49:54.198 --> 49:57.168
<i>But I don't have it.</i>
<i>I'm just being anxious.</i>

49:57.203 --> 49:59.831
<i>I've barely been anywhere</i>
<i>except the grocery store.</i>

50:08.341 --> 50:09.942
<i>I mean, it doesn't hurt</i>

50:09.977 --> 50:11.507
<i>to get tested.</i>

50:11.543 --> 50:14.052
<i>Better safe than sorry,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

50:17.886 --> 50:19.684
<i>God.</i>

50:19.720 --> 50:23.127
<i>I did not expect them</i>
<i>to touch my brain like that.</i>

50:30.263 --> 50:33.396
<i>Oh, I'm fucking exhausted.</i>

50:33.431 --> 50:35.039
<i>I guess that's what happens</i>

50:35.074 --> 50:37.570
<i>when you stay up</i>
<i>till- 00 a.m. every night.</i>

50:40.570 --> 50:42.911
<i> Maybe if I just...</i>

50:42.946 --> 50:46.315
<i>close my eyes for a second.</i>

50:48.711 --> 50:50.781
<i>What time is it?</i>

50:52.523 --> 50:53.883
<i>What?</i>

51:02.931 --> 51:04.993
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>God.</i>

51:05.028 --> 51:07.231
<i>I need to start remembering</i>
<i>to wear deodorant</i>

51:07.266 --> 51:09.404
<i>more in quarantine.</i>

51:09.440 --> 51:12.308
<i>Kind of hard when there's no</i>
<i>one around to smell you.</i>

51:14.270 --> 51:15.712
<i>Wait.</i>

51:15.747 --> 51:17.514
<i>Why am I so sweaty?</i>

51:19.615 --> 51:23.649
<i>That's...That's what happens</i>
<i>when you break a fever.</i>

51:27.957 --> 51:29.594
<i>Okay.</i>

51:29.629 --> 51:32.289
<i>No fever, no corona.</i>

51:32.324 --> 51:33.857
<i>I'm just being paranoid.</i>

51:51.814 --> 51:53.811
Dear God.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.379
I don't believe in you,

51:59.415 --> 52:01.890
but please

52:01.926 --> 52:04.294
don't let me have corona.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.895
I just-- that would

52:08.930 --> 52:11.394
really suck.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.734
Um...

52:13.769 --> 52:15.239
For me.

52:15.874 --> 52:19.642
And for you, and for everyone,

52:19.678 --> 52:21.872
really, um...

52:25.817 --> 52:28.549
Yeah.
Thank you.

52:30.482 --> 52:33.424
Oh, shit.
I mean, um...

52:33.459 --> 52:34.885
Amen.

52:36.524 --> 52:38.922
And I hope that you're
having a good day.

52:43.964 --> 52:45.236
Ow.

52:55.241 --> 52:56.577
<i>Fuck.</i>

53:38.253 --> 53:40.588
I'm gonna fucking die.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.850
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>CF Center, this is Jenny.</i>

54:06.885 --> 54:08.950
<i> Ugh, not her.</i>

54:08.985 --> 54:10.948
<i>She's the worst.</i>

54:12.285 --> 54:13.549
<i> Hello?</i>

54:13.584 --> 54:16.026
Hi.
This is Terese.

54:16.062 --> 54:19.261
Um, I was just calling
for Angela

54:19.296 --> 54:23.729
or anybody else
that I can talk to.

54:23.765 --> 54:26.101
<i> Oh, everybody's</i>
<i>already out for the day.</i>

54:26.136 --> 54:27.633
<i>I'm the only one in-clinic.</i>

54:27.669 --> 54:30.374
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

54:33.145 --> 54:35.471
Yeah, I just--
I think I have COVID.

54:35.506 --> 54:36.872
<i> Oh, no.</i>

54:36.907 --> 54:39.246
<i>Well, um, have you</i>
<i>gotten tested?</i>

54:39.281 --> 54:42.314
Yes.
Yesterday actually.

54:42.349 --> 54:44.111
<i> Good, good.</i>

54:44.146 --> 54:45.818
<i>When are you supposed</i>
<i>to hear back?</i>

54:46.924 --> 54:48.616
Two to five days?

54:48.651 --> 54:49.751
<i> Gotcha.</i>

54:49.786 --> 54:51.093
<i>Well, definitely let us know</i>

54:51.129 --> 54:52.891
<i>when you get that result back.</i>

54:54.431 --> 54:56.532
<i>Have you been having</i>
<i>any symptoms?</i>

54:57.870 --> 54:59.628
Yeah, I had a cough.

54:59.664 --> 55:01.795
Um, it was a normal cough.

55:01.831 --> 55:03.739
Well, it was a sick cough.

55:03.774 --> 55:05.304
And...

55:05.339 --> 55:08.337
Today, I had a fever.

55:08.372 --> 55:10.609
So...

55:10.645 --> 55:13.081
<i> Yeah, you don't</i>
<i>sound good.</i>

55:13.116 --> 55:15.518
<i>You sound really stuffy.</i>

55:17.187 --> 55:20.749
Yeah.
That's 'cause I...

55:20.784 --> 55:23.185
was just crying a little bit.

55:23.962 --> 55:25.522
<i> Oh, honey.</i>

55:25.557 --> 55:27.893
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

55:29.366 --> 55:32.192
<i>This must be</i>
<i>a lot to deal with.</i>

55:32.227 --> 55:35.867
<i>You know, the anxiety alone,</i>
<i>I'm sure.</i>

55:35.902 --> 55:38.341
<i>We've been exposed to COVID</i>
<i>in the hospital,</i>

55:38.376 --> 55:43.204
<i>and it's just such</i>
<i>a terrible disease.</i>

55:43.240 --> 55:46.679
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>having a chronic lung disease</i>

55:46.714 --> 55:49.987
<i>makes it that much more scary,</i>
<i>right?</i>

55:50.022 --> 55:52.651
<i>This must be really tough.</i>

55:52.686 --> 55:54.485
<i> Thanks for</i>
<i>reminding me.</i>

55:54.520 --> 55:57.018
<i>So helpful, as always.</i>

55:57.054 --> 55:59.793
<i> Terese?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

56:00.666 --> 56:01.762
<i>Hello?</i>

56:07.468 --> 56:08.996
<i> Desperate times call</i>

56:09.032 --> 56:10.969
<i>for desperate measures,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

56:14.006 --> 56:16.570
<i>Damn, I haven't refilled these</i>
<i>in a minute.</i>

56:18.709 --> 56:20.418
<i>Haven't needed to.</i>

57:00.483 --> 57:02.883
<i>Is there any purpose</i>
<i>in wiping these down</i>

57:02.918 --> 57:04.627
<i>if I already have COVID?</i>

57:07.094 --> 57:10.223
<i>Whatever, I'll just give it</i>
<i>the Amanda treatment.</i>

57:10.259 --> 57:12.767
<i>Watch it be useless</i>
<i>anyway though.</i>

57:23.247 --> 57:24.776
<i>My shopper had to have known</i>

57:24.812 --> 57:27.551
<i>I was not doing well</i>
<i>with this order.</i>

57:47.300 --> 57:48.733
Hey!

57:48.768 --> 57:51.272
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

57:51.307 --> 57:52.767
<i>Looks like a life vest.</i>

57:52.803 --> 57:54.742
Oh, this is my vest.

57:54.778 --> 57:57.574
No, this would not help me
very much in the water.

57:59.252 --> 58:01.316
-<i> Your vest?</i>

58:01.351 --> 58:03.213
Yeah, like for my treatments.

58:04.486 --> 58:06.450
Like my airway clearance.

58:06.485 --> 58:08.090
Or whatever.

58:08.126 --> 58:10.484
<i>Oh, right, right.</i>

58:10.519 --> 58:12.728
<i>I feel like I've never</i>
<i>seen you wear that before.</i>

58:14.224 --> 58:17.992
Yeah, probably
'cause I wear it in my room

58:18.027 --> 58:20.032
when I actually do treatments.

58:23.338 --> 58:25.270
<i>Are you okay?</i>

58:25.305 --> 58:26.273
Yeah.

58:26.309 --> 58:27.908
I just, like, um...

58:30.713 --> 58:33.617
I feel like, just, like,
I may have COVID.

58:34.648 --> 58:36.813
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

58:36.848 --> 58:39.414
<i>Uh, why do you think that?</i>

58:40.250 --> 58:42.687
I don't know, well,
I had that cough,

58:42.722 --> 58:45.994
and then I-- I spiked a fever,

58:46.030 --> 58:49.663
and, um...

58:49.698 --> 58:52.196
I've just been feeling
really shitty.

58:53.396 --> 58:56.801
And, like, I have
some other symptoms, so...

58:56.837 --> 58:59.535
<i>But you haven't</i>
<i>tested positive.</i>

58:59.570 --> 59:01.244
Not yet.

59:01.279 --> 59:03.306
I took a test two days ago.

59:03.342 --> 59:06.148
<i>Uh-huh, and how long till they,</i>
<i>um-- you get that back?</i>

59:09.186 --> 59:10.720
Two to five days.

59:13.853 --> 59:15.315
<i>But you can't know it's COVID</i>

59:15.351 --> 59:17.727
<i>until you get the results back,</i>
<i>right?</i>

59:20.930 --> 59:23.530
Yeah, I just-- I don't know what
else it would be though.

59:23.565 --> 59:25.696
-You know?
-<i> Right.</i>

59:25.731 --> 59:28.871
<i>Well, um, I'm so sorry</i>

59:28.906 --> 59:32.339
<i>that you're feeling so shitty</i>
<i>and that you're alone.</i>

59:32.374 --> 59:34.678
<i>That's so scary.</i>

59:36.077 --> 59:38.879
<i>Do you want me to come</i>
<i>and take care of you?</i>

59:38.915 --> 59:41.547
<i>It's only a three-hour drive.</i>
<i>It's really--</i>

59:41.582 --> 59:43.352
No.
No, it's fine.

59:43.387 --> 59:45.623
I wouldn't wanna expose you.

59:50.789 --> 59:53.257
<i>Have you told your mom?</i>

59:55.257 --> 59:56.928
I just-- I don't
wanna worry her,

59:56.964 --> 1:00:00.427
and, like, have her
calling me like...

1:00:00.462 --> 1:00:02.805
<i> Terese,</i>
<i>you're gonna be fine.</i>

1:00:38.238 --> 1:00:40.136
<i> Right about now</i>
<i>would be a great time</i>

1:00:40.172 --> 1:00:42.405
<i>for my test results</i>
<i>to come back.</i>

1:00:54.387 --> 1:00:57.956
<i>Well, at least I don't</i>
<i>have it that bad.</i>

1:00:57.991 --> 1:01:00.361
<i>Maybe I got away</i>
<i>with a mild case.</i>

1:01:03.494 --> 1:01:06.997
<i>I've managed to not have</i>
<i>a mental breakdown today.</i>

1:01:07.033 --> 1:01:09.663
<i>I'd like to keep</i>
<i>that streak up.</i>

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.816
<i>There is nothing more</i>
<i>infurating</i>

1:01:21.851 --> 1:01:23.783
<i>than watching young,</i>
<i>dumb people flaunt</i>

1:01:23.819 --> 1:01:25.786
<i>parties and bars</i>
<i>on social media</i>

1:01:25.822 --> 1:01:28.988
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of a fucking plague.</i>

1:01:29.023 --> 1:01:31.123
<i>I barely go out,</i>
<i>and I don't see anyone,</i>

1:01:31.158 --> 1:01:33.528
<i>but I still somehow got COVID</i>
<i>from, like,</i>

1:01:33.564 --> 1:01:36.129
<i>running errands or something.</i>

1:01:36.164 --> 1:01:38.698
<i>And these idiots probably</i>
<i>won't even get infected</i>

1:01:38.733 --> 1:01:41.065
<i>because karma is a bitch.</i>

1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:43.433
<i>And not in the way</i>
<i>I want it to be.</i>

1:01:51.747 --> 1:01:53.575
<i>It's been six days.</i>

1:01:53.610 --> 1:01:56.446
<i>Where the fuck are</i>
<i>those fucking test results?</i>

1:02:06.863 --> 1:02:08.432
<i> Hello, LA County</i>
<i>testing site.</i>

1:02:08.467 --> 1:02:10.862
<i>-This is Terrence.</i>
-Yeah, hi.

1:02:10.897 --> 1:02:13.900
Um, I got tested on Thursday,

1:02:13.936 --> 1:02:15.971
and I still haven't gotten
my results.

1:02:16.007 --> 1:02:17.372
<i> Okay, yeah,</i>
<i>so we're pretty overwhelmed</i>

1:02:17.407 --> 1:02:18.773
<i>at the moment.</i>

1:02:18.809 --> 1:02:19.904
<i>I can't look</i>
<i>into anything for you</i>

1:02:19.939 --> 1:02:21.779
<i>unless it's been seven days.</i>

1:02:23.481 --> 1:02:25.539
Yeah, I just feel really awful,

1:02:25.574 --> 1:02:29.544
and I really need to know
if I have COVID.

1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:32.116
<i> Yeah, well,</i>
<i>if your symptoms worsen,</i>

1:02:32.151 --> 1:02:33.886
<i>you should seek</i>
<i>professional help</i>

1:02:33.922 --> 1:02:35.854
<i>and go to an ER</i>
<i>if you start...</i>

1:02:35.889 --> 1:02:36.854
Having trouble breathing.

1:02:36.889 --> 1:02:37.888
Yeah, thanks, Terrence.

1:02:37.923 --> 1:02:39.621
Really fucking helpful.

1:02:44.002 --> 1:02:46.463
I probably should have said
that last part in my head.

1:02:57.843 --> 1:02:59.644
Aww.
Poor baby.

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:01.041
Are you drunk?

1:03:01.077 --> 1:03:02.717
No.

1:03:02.752 --> 1:03:05.020
-Gas station sushi.

1:03:05.818 --> 1:03:07.424
Can I help you?

1:03:07.459 --> 1:03:08.922
Or do you need-- I don't know--

1:03:08.957 --> 1:03:10.754
do you need more soy sauce,
wasabi?

1:03:28.612 --> 1:03:30.107
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1:03:30.142 --> 1:03:31.578
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1:03:31.614 --> 1:03:33.239
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1:03:33.275 --> 1:03:34.845
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

1:03:41.850 --> 1:03:45.926
<i>I thought if I just lived</i>
<i>my life how I wanted to,</i>

1:03:45.961 --> 1:03:48.525
<i>it would be worth</i>
<i>it in the end.</i>

1:03:51.627 --> 1:03:54.161
<i>I'm not ready for it</i>
<i>to be the end.</i>

1:04:14.819 --> 1:04:16.058
Ow.

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:17.952
<i>Okay.</i>

1:05:17.988 --> 1:05:20.347
<i>Okay, I was only out</i>
<i>for two minutes.</i>

1:05:20.382 --> 1:05:22.124
<i>That's not too bad.</i>

1:05:23.386 --> 1:05:26.491
<i>Or is it?</i>
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1:05:27.391 --> 1:05:29.362
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

1:05:36.670 --> 1:05:38.204
Hello?

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.274
<i> Hello.</i>
<i>This is Dr. Samuels.</i>

1:05:40.309 --> 1:05:43.439
<i>I'm on call tonight.</i>
<i>What seems to be the issue?</i>

1:05:43.474 --> 1:05:46.783
Hello, uh, yeah,
I think I have COVID.

1:05:46.819 --> 1:05:48.514
<i> Have you</i>
<i>been tested?</i>

1:05:49.016 --> 1:05:50.982
Uh, yeah, about a week ago.

1:05:51.017 --> 1:05:52.847
It hasn't come back yet.

1:05:53.926 --> 1:05:57.456
Um, but I've had a fever
and symptoms all week.

1:05:57.491 --> 1:06:01.422
Um, and I have a really tight
pressure on my chest.

1:06:01.457 --> 1:06:03.963
Um, and my hands are tingly.

1:06:03.998 --> 1:06:07.130
And I think I just passed out.

1:06:07.165 --> 1:06:08.467
<i> You think?</i>

1:06:11.443 --> 1:06:13.944
I did.
I did.

1:06:13.979 --> 1:06:16.145
<i> And you're</i>
<i>a CF patient, right?</i>

1:06:17.814 --> 1:06:20.940
-Yes
-<i> Okay.</i>

1:06:20.976 --> 1:06:22.742
<i>I think we should bring you in</i>
<i>to check you out</i>

1:06:22.778 --> 1:06:24.646
<i>and see if you need</i>
<i>to be admitted.</i>

1:06:24.682 --> 1:06:26.579
<i>We'll be able to test you</i>
<i>again for COVID</i>

1:06:26.614 --> 1:06:28.288
<i>as well as a fall flu panel.</i>

1:06:28.324 --> 1:06:31.092
<i>But you just passed out,</i>
<i>so I wouldn't recommend</i>

1:06:31.127 --> 1:06:33.625
<i>for you to operate</i>
<i>a vehicle right now.</i>

1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:36.363
<i>Do you have anyone who could</i>
<i>bring you to the hospital?</i>

1:07:00.856 --> 1:07:02.257
Why didn't you tell me?

1:07:04.486 --> 1:07:06.228
That you were sick?

1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:11.134
I didn't tell anyone.

1:07:12.163 --> 1:07:15.004
Well, except Syd.

1:07:15.039 --> 1:07:18.207
It must be so scary for you.

1:07:21.942 --> 1:07:24.378
Yeah.
It is.

1:07:25.181 --> 1:07:27.907
That's partially why
I didn't tell anyone

1:07:27.942 --> 1:07:31.985
because everyone telling me
how scary it is

1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:34.223
doesn't make it any less scary.

1:07:36.526 --> 1:07:38.128
Sorry.

1:07:40.630 --> 1:07:42.099
It's okay.

1:07:47.433 --> 1:07:49.397
Why didn't you tell me
about Zack

1:07:49.432 --> 1:07:51.174
right when you got back?

1:07:52.542 --> 1:07:54.939
Uh...

1:07:54.975 --> 1:07:58.204
I thought that

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:03.048
if I made a big deal out of it,
then it would have been real.

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:05.345
And also-- --

1:08:05.381 --> 1:08:07.190
we don't talk.

1:08:09.384 --> 1:08:10.888
We could.

1:08:10.924 --> 1:08:13.093
Could we?

1:08:13.129 --> 1:08:14.927
I know I didn't know you
that well

1:08:14.962 --> 1:08:16.692
before I moved in,

1:08:16.728 --> 1:08:21.133
but you never tried very hard
to change that.

1:08:21.735 --> 1:08:25.208
And then things got so tense
when I came back from Zack's.

1:08:28.604 --> 1:08:31.814
You just...didn't understand.

1:08:33.743 --> 1:08:36.377
You're right.
I didn't un--

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:38.353
I don't understand.

1:08:40.421 --> 1:08:44.524
You've always acted like CF
was no big deal.

1:08:46.856 --> 1:08:49.463
You never actually told me
what it was.

1:08:53.832 --> 1:08:57.130
I'm not good at, like,
explaining the science of it.

1:08:59.835 --> 1:09:02.908
And you're not even
from Arizona.

1:09:09.315 --> 1:09:12.347
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

1:09:12.382 --> 1:09:14.818
Um...

1:09:19.323 --> 1:09:21.154
I guess I just...

1:09:22.333 --> 1:09:26.665
I envy how little you have
to care about all of this.

1:09:29.331 --> 1:09:30.964
I know.

1:09:30.999 --> 1:09:34.306
I wish I could go out
and see my friends.

1:09:34.341 --> 1:09:37.278
Go to restaurants
and just...

1:09:37.313 --> 1:09:41.251
feel invincible like
everybody else I know.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:43.880
But I'm not.

1:09:45.252 --> 1:09:48.291
I've never been invincible.

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.360
Especially now.

1:09:57.331 --> 1:09:59.698
Bye.
Thanks again.

1:10:05.671 --> 1:10:07.836
<i> Your oxygen</i>
<i>and EKG look good,</i>

1:10:07.871 --> 1:10:09.736
<i>and your chest x-ray</i>
<i>is actually better</i>

1:10:09.771 --> 1:10:11.109
<i>than the last time you had one.</i>

1:10:11.144 --> 1:10:12.643
<i> Okay.</i>

1:10:12.678 --> 1:10:14.348
<i> So I feel fine</i>
<i>to send you home.</i>

1:10:14.384 --> 1:10:16.317
<i>You probably passed out</i>
<i>from dehydration.</i>

1:10:16.352 --> 1:10:18.154
<i>Just keep drinking plenty</i>
<i>of fluids.</i>

1:10:18.189 --> 1:10:19.650
<i>We should have</i>
<i>your results tomorrow.</i>

1:10:19.685 --> 1:10:21.022
<i>Someone from the clinic</i>
<i>will call you,</i>

1:10:21.057 --> 1:10:22.221
<i>and we will go from there.</i>

1:10:22.257 --> 1:10:24.023
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:10:51.985 --> 1:10:53.086
Hello?

1:10:53.121 --> 1:10:54.253
<i> Hey, Terese.</i>

1:10:54.288 --> 1:10:56.759
<i>It's Angela from the CF Clinic.</i>

1:10:56.795 --> 1:10:58.851
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1:10:58.887 --> 1:11:01.555
Um, I'm all right.
I'm tired.

1:11:01.590 --> 1:11:03.099
<i> Yeah.</i>

1:11:03.135 --> 1:11:05.225
<i>I heard you had a late night</i>
<i>at ATC.</i>

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:08.203
<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>
<i>Your test results came back!</i>

1:11:08.239 --> 1:11:12.609
<i>And let me just</i>
<i>pull them up here...</i>

1:11:12.644 --> 1:11:14.074
<i>Let's see.</i>

1:11:14.109 --> 1:11:17.109
<i>I think it's in here...</i>

1:11:17.144 --> 1:11:19.442
<i>And you are...</i>

1:11:19.477 --> 1:11:21.750
<i>negative for COVID!</i>

1:11:21.785 --> 1:11:23.320
Oh, my God.

1:11:24.579 --> 1:11:26.180
Oh, my God.

1:11:27.090 --> 1:11:28.418
Oh, my God, so what do I have?

1:11:28.453 --> 1:11:29.952
What's wrong with me?

1:11:29.988 --> 1:11:34.092
<i> You did test positive</i>
<i>for rhinovirus.</i>

1:11:34.127 --> 1:11:35.728
Rhinovirus?

1:11:36.967 --> 1:11:38.968
<i> You had a cold?</i>

1:11:39.003 --> 1:11:40.661
Yeah.

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:43.234
I just had a fucking cold!

1:11:43.270 --> 1:11:44.836
Just a fucking cold.

1:11:44.871 --> 1:11:47.675
Worst cold of my life,
but, like, it wasn't COVID.

1:11:47.711 --> 1:11:48.945
Yet.

1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:50.144
<i> Wait, don't say that!</i>

1:11:50.179 --> 1:11:52.811
-<i> Please.</i>

1:11:53.312 --> 1:11:54.777
Yeah, I know.

1:11:54.812 --> 1:11:56.578
I was already taking
very few risks,

1:11:56.614 --> 1:11:58.988
but this has convinced me

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:01.257
to be just a complete hermit

1:12:01.292 --> 1:12:02.917
and never go outside ever again
in my life.

1:12:02.952 --> 1:12:05.126
<i>Ah, good.</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

1:12:05.161 --> 1:12:07.826
<i>'Cause you can't die before me.</i>

1:12:07.861 --> 1:12:10.697
<i> Should I tell her</i>
<i>I probably will anyway?</i>

1:12:13.165 --> 1:12:14.597
<i>No.</i>

1:12:14.632 --> 1:12:16.370
<i>No need to sour the mood.</i>

1:12:16.406 --> 1:12:18.705
<i>I'll be very kind to her</i>
<i>in my will.</i>

1:12:19.737 --> 1:12:21.508
It's so funny though.

1:12:21.543 --> 1:12:24.110
The irony in getting
another viral illness

1:12:24.145 --> 1:12:25.880
during a padnemic,

1:12:25.916 --> 1:12:28.046
Like--

1:12:30.417 --> 1:12:33.321
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:12:33.356 --> 1:12:35.550
Syd, I coughed,
and I didn't die though.

1:12:35.585 --> 1:12:37.592
I broke the trope.

1:12:39.664 --> 1:12:41.062
<i>What?</i>

1:12:41.097 --> 1:12:42.558
Nothing.
Never mind.

1:12:42.593 --> 1:12:44.065
I'll tell you sometime.

1:12:46.933 --> 1:12:50.231
<i> Dude, where did</i>
<i>rhinovirus even come from?</i>

1:12:51.434 --> 1:12:52.869
Oof.

1:12:52.904 --> 1:12:55.472

got freaky at the zoo.

1:12:56.575 --> 1:12:58.344

1:12:58.379 --> 1:13:00.082

You are so right.

1:15:20.014 --> 1:15:22.020
No!
Of course not.

1:15:23.084 --> 1:15:24.820
<i>Well, do you have any plans?</i>

1:15:24.855 --> 1:15:26.822
No!
It's a pandemic, Mom.

1:15:26.858 --> 1:15:28.888
Where am I about to go?

1:15:28.923 --> 1:15:30.729
<i>Ah.</i>
<i>Well.</i>

1:15:30.765 --> 1:15:32.630
<i>Glad to hear</i>
<i>you're not going out,</i>

1:15:32.665 --> 1:15:34.604
<i>but you should do something!</i>

1:15:36.672 --> 1:15:40.134
<i>You can order</i>
<i>a nice Postmates on me.</i>

1:15:40.170 --> 1:15:43.406
<i>Something you'd consider...</i>
<i>bougie?</i>

1:15:45.212 --> 1:15:48.316
You say bougie in LA, you don't
know what you're in for, Mom.

1:15:48.352 --> 1:15:50.587
-But thank you.

1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:53.282
<i>Anything new, sweetheart?</i>

1:15:53.924 --> 1:15:56.890
Uh...no.

1:15:58.188 --> 1:16:02.222
Well, I did have a bit
of a cold actually.

1:16:02.258 --> 1:16:03.494
<i>You don't think it's COVID,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

1:16:03.529 --> 1:16:04.528
Nope.
Nope.

1:16:04.563 --> 1:16:05.896
Made sure of that.

1:16:05.931 --> 1:16:08.195
I got tested.
It came back negative.

1:16:08.230 --> 1:16:09.996
And I've been feeling
a lot better

1:16:10.032 --> 1:16:12.273
as of recently too, so...

1:16:12.308 --> 1:16:14.738
<i>Oh, that's a relief!</i>

1:16:14.773 --> 1:16:17.009
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

1:16:19.441 --> 1:16:23.510
You know, but I've been
really good actually.

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:27.384
Applying for a job
I might actually like.

1:16:28.824 --> 1:16:31.157
I'm getting it through a friend,
so we'll see.

1:16:31.593 --> 1:16:33.586
Oh, my gosh.
Guess what I did.

1:16:35.166 --> 1:16:37.394
I tried to make bread.

1:16:39.765 --> 1:16:41.294
I found this recipe online...

1:16:41.329 --> 1:16:44.064
<i>♪ Terese ♪</i>

1:16:44.099 --> 1:16:48.811

1:16:48.847 --> 1:16:49.935

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:52.808
<i>-Yeah!</i>
<i>-Happy birthday, Terese!</i>

1:16:52.843 --> 1:16:54.879
<i>-Nice.</i>
-Thank you!

1:16:54.914 --> 1:16:57.553
I'm just 23.
It's not that exciting.

1:16:57.588 --> 1:16:59.080
<i> Hey, it's</i>
<i>your Jordan birthday!</i>

1:16:59.115 --> 1:17:01.213
-<i> That's right!</i>
-Wow.

1:17:01.248 --> 1:17:03.757
If only I cared about sports.

1:17:03.793 --> 1:17:07.728
Still, this is kind of, like,
anticlimactic.

1:17:07.764 --> 1:17:10.431
<i> Uh, how much</i>
<i>is that edible again?</i>

1:17:10.466 --> 1:17:12.730
50 milligrams?
100 maybe?

1:17:12.766 --> 1:17:15.468
Oh, I should know that.

1:17:15.503 --> 1:17:16.703
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

1:17:16.738 --> 1:17:18.133
-I should know that.
-<i> Ugh.</i>

1:17:18.168 --> 1:17:19.675
<i>You could've just said</i>
<i>"Fuck it"</i>

1:17:19.710 --> 1:17:22.075
<i>and gone to some outdoor bar</i>
<i>or something.</i>

1:17:22.111 --> 1:17:23.807
Mm.

1:17:23.842 --> 1:17:26.840
What a privilege.
I wish!

1:17:26.876 --> 1:17:28.408
I'm good though.

1:17:28.443 --> 1:17:30.578
<i>Well, you already</i>
<i>survived COVID once.</i>

1:17:30.613 --> 1:17:33.121
<i>None of us would want you</i>
<i>to take that chance again.</i>

1:17:33.156 --> 1:17:34.851
Mm.

1:17:34.887 --> 1:17:37.351
<i>Yeah, I don't think any of us</i>

1:17:37.387 --> 1:17:40.026
<i>should be taking those kind</i>
<i>of chances.</i>

1:17:44.364 --> 1:17:45.629
Yeah.

1:17:45.665 --> 1:17:48.199
That was<i> definitely</i>

1:17:48.234 --> 1:17:51.532
enough excitement to last me
the rest of quarantine.

1:17:52.468 --> 1:17:56.670
And enough fear for the rest
of my life, so...

1:17:56.706 --> 1:17:59.373
<i> Wait, I thought you</i>
<i>didn't end up having COVID.</i>

1:17:59.408 --> 1:18:01.650
<i>She didn't.</i>
<i>She's just hella dramatic.</i>

1:18:01.686 --> 1:18:03.014
-No, I thought I had it!

1:18:03.049 --> 1:18:04.649
Which means I don't wanna
actually get it

1:18:04.685 --> 1:18:05.849
and go through that again.

1:18:05.885 --> 1:18:07.956
<i> Hey, that will not happen.</i>

1:18:07.992 --> 1:18:10.760
<i>Because I refuse to believe</i>
<i>the world can be that cruel.</i>

1:18:11.526 --> 1:18:14.228
<i> Mm.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:18:14.264 --> 1:18:15.830
Here's hoping.

1:18:15.866 --> 1:18:17.994
-<i> Cheers!</i>
<i>-Happy freakin' birthday!</i>

1:18:18.030 --> 1:18:19.299
<i>-To the birthday girl!</i>
<i>-Whoo!</i>

1:18:19.335 --> 1:18:20.568
I love you guys.

1:18:20.604 --> 1:18:22.032
<i>-Let's get it.</i>
<i>-But seriously--</i>

1:18:22.068 --> 1:18:23.329
<i>Check how many</i>
<i>milligrams that was.</i>

1:18:23.365 --> 1:18:25.030
-Um, it's too late.

1:18:25.066 --> 1:18:26.174
I ate all of it.

1:18:26.210 --> 1:18:27.376
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1:18:27.412 --> 1:18:28.373
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>She's gone.</i>

1:18:29.746 --> 1:18:31.306
My body will count 'em
and let me know--

1:18:31.342 --> 1:18:32.908
<i> It's too late</i>
<i>to stop it though.</i>

1:18:34.509 --> 1:18:35.912
<i> But, like,</i>
<i>don't get in a car.</i>

1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:39.850
Where would I go?
Get in a car?

1:18:39.886 --> 1:18:42.088
Where would I go?
