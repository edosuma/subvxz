00:01.084 --> 00:02.294
<i>Previously on</i> Recovery Road...

00:02.294 --> 00:03.337
Hi. I'm Maddie.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.380
You're supposed to say
you're an alcoholic.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.424
I'm... Maddie.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.842
<i>Fool House,</i> the reality show.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.260
I've seen every season
of this show,

00:10.260 --> 00:12.012
so I know exactly
what they want.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.265
‐This isn't water.
‐No, it's not. It's vodka.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.100
Maddie: She knows
she doesn't have a child?

00:17.100 --> 00:21.480
Trish has learned some
strategies in therapy
to help manage the delusion.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.565
She'll snap a rubber band on her
wrist, among other things.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.442
Maddie: <i>It's Diesel.</i>
<i>He's a drug dealer.</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:27.236
I know you guys
took someone out.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.904
That didn't happen.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.157
You buried a gun,
a gun that killed someone?
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:32.157 --> 00:34.618
I don't know. Harper said
we should, and I didn't know
what else to do.

00:34.618 --> 00:38.163
‐We're really gonna miss you.
‐You guys think
you're so frickin' great!

00:38.163 --> 00:40.165
Just 'cause you're
all clean and stuff!

00:40.165 --> 00:42.125
(stammering)
I have a fiancé.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.086
I know you do.

00:44.086 --> 00:48.090
Rebecca made
some very bad decisions.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.134
Maddie Graham is
at Springtime Meadows
with Rebecca Granger?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.469
Did you know about this?

00:52.469 --> 00:55.681
Donna Marie:
You weren't being an alarmist.
Look at what I found.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.642
This is Charlotte Graham,
Maddie's mom. I need your help.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.102
I had them do a locker search.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.312
I'm going to tell Maddie.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.649
I... blacked out
a couple weeks ago.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.778
I have no idea what I did
or where I was.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.949
Maddie: <i>Life can easily be</i>
<i>broken down into moments‐‐</i>

01:13.949 --> 01:16.285
<i>most mundane, forgettable,</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:20.205
<i>but occasionally, you have</i>
<i>the ones that define you.</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:23.041
<i>The great challenge is to know</i>
<i>which are which.</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:25.377
EMT:
Oh! What the hell are
you two doing in here?

01:25.377 --> 01:28.297
We're about to have sex.
What does it look like?

01:28.297 --> 01:30.465
EMT:
Get the hell
out of here, now!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.427
What? It was an emergency.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.345
(giggles)

01:35.345 --> 01:36.972
What'd you say
your name was again?

01:36.972 --> 01:37.973
Cynthia.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.226
Maddie:
<i>The times you got hurt...</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:45.022
<i>or the times you hurt others.</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:03.790

<i>that you can't.</i>

All right. Wes, congratulations
on six months of sobriety.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.251
‐Well done, Wes.
‐Good job, Wes.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.253
Good. Good job.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.257
Would you, uh‐‐
Would you like to say something?

02:54.257 --> 02:57.052
No. I'm good.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.470
Craig:
Okay.

02:58.470 --> 03:04.226
Uh, Maddie, congratulations
on 30 days of sobriety.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.561
‐Yeah.
‐Yes!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.398
Well done, you.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.150
Would, uh‐‐ Would you like
to say something?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.236
Yes. I would.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.573
Where's Rebecca?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.619
We've been over this, Maddie.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.329
Rebecca left
the house voluntarily,

03:24.329 --> 03:26.039
‐and I'm not at liberty‐‐
‐You're lying.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.416
She wouldn't do that.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.669
‐Maddie, you need
to lower your voice.
‐Oh, shut up!

03:30.669 --> 03:32.129
So you're my dad now?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.255
You know what?
Screw this.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.883
(emphatically)
Sit down now!

03:43.098 --> 03:44.599
(scoffs)

03:56.736 --> 04:01.491
No one is more upset about
Rebecca's departure than I am.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.703
Okay? But being here
is a choice...

04:06.496 --> 04:09.040
for most of you.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.794
And we can choose to get upset
and put everything at risk

04:12.794 --> 04:15.380
or we can move on.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.637
We all screw up.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.017
It's what we do next
that really matters.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.818
Hey, Cynthia, did you hear
what happened?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.820
‐Uh...
‐Rebecca left. I‐‐

04:38.820 --> 04:40.822
You‐‐ you look like ass.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.824
‐Are you okay?
‐Yeah, I'm fine.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.577
(stammering)
And we'll talk about Rebecca,
but I just‐‐ I need‐‐

04:45.577 --> 04:48.371
Hey. Do you think that you and I
could talk for a minute?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.458
Uh... I don't... really...

04:51.458 --> 04:53.752
‐uh... yeah. Sure.
‐Okay.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.255
Hey, I need your help.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.799
‐Uh, now's not the time, Maddie.
‐Please!

04:58.799 --> 05:01.551
We have to go find Rebecca.
She needs to be here.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.720
‐I need her here.
‐If she doesn't want to be‐‐

05:03.720 --> 05:05.388
You don't understand.
Just yesterday,

05:05.388 --> 05:08.600
she was telling me
how happy she is, here, sober.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.561
This doesn't make any sense.
All right? I'm really worried.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.938
You have school.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.523
And a surprisingly a very,
very good attendance record

05:14.523 --> 05:18.193
for someone who was caught
on campus with vodka,
so I will skip.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.654
‐Please.
‐(sighs)

05:20.654 --> 05:22.948
Okay. We'll take the van.
Let me go grab my phone.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.491
Thanks.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.160
Oh, and, Maddie, congrats
on that 30‐day sobriety.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.662
It's a bigger deal
than you realize.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.207
Yeah, I know.
I promise I do.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.840
I think that maybe
it's best if, um...

05:39.840 --> 05:41.883
‐well, at least
for the next days‐‐
‐I called off the wedding.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.718
‐What?
‐(sighs)

05:43.718 --> 05:45.512
(stammers) Please
tell me you didn't‐‐

05:45.512 --> 05:49.182
Craig, I think we owe it
to ourselves to find out
what's going on between us.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.394
(stammering)
I can't.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.438
There is something here,

05:55.438 --> 05:58.650
and it's‐‐
it's more than just...

05:58.650 --> 06:01.736
‐some bizarre sexual thing.
‐No, no. Wait. Cynthia, I can't.

06:01.736 --> 06:05.532
I mean, I can't
begin a relationship
ending somebody else's.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.784
But Paul and I obviously
weren't meant to be together,

06:07.784 --> 06:10.537
otherwise, I would not feel
the way that I do about you.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.789
I just can't be
that person, okay?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.750
I‐‐ sor‐‐ sorry.
I can't.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.461

07:09.638 --> 07:12.057
‐Um, okay.
‐Thanks.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.669
Craig's voice:
<i>Rebecca Granger</i>
<i>has discharged herself</i>

07:40.669 --> 07:42.337
<i>from Springtime Meadows.</i>

07:42.337 --> 07:44.714
<i>An attempt was made</i>
<i>to convince her to stay.</i>

07:44.714 --> 07:49.803
<i>The prohibitive articles found</i>
<i>in her possession were</i>
<i>a small bag of Suboxone</i>

07:49.803 --> 07:53.014
<i>and a box</i>
<i>containing instruments</i>
<i>for self‐mutilation.</i>

07:53.014 --> 07:54.432
This is very serious.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.351
These are
two major infractions.

07:56.351 --> 08:00.021
I know. I know, but please,
Craig, just hear me out.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.566
Why would you intentionally
hurt yourself, Becks?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.319
‐I mean, what's going on?
‐It's complicated.

08:06.319 --> 08:10.448
I could try to explain it
to you, but I don't think
you would understand.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.867
And I'll stop. I promise.
Just‐‐ just hear me out.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.911
And the Suboxone?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.871
‐It helps me‐‐
‐Well, it's not allowed,

08:16.871 --> 08:19.916
‐and you know it.
‐I know. I just‐‐

08:19.916 --> 08:22.210
Where did you get it?
You don't have a prescription.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.004
‐I can't say.
‐Rebecca, we need to know.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.176
‐I got 'em from Doug.
‐Doug?

08:30.176 --> 08:34.514
What? Who came in here
and practically assaulted you,
that Doug?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.100
That night, he had
accidentally taken one too many.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.479
I don't do that. I'm very
careful about my dosage,
and so is he.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.773
It was an accident, Craig.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.818
Look, in order to remain
a resident here,

08:46.818 --> 08:49.154
you're going to need
to complete a detox.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.741
No. I can't do another detox.
I can't.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.743
And the Suboxone helps me.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.786
‐Just please‐‐
‐It's against
the rules, Rebecca.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.787
All right.
Does she need to be here?

08:57.787 --> 08:58.830
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I do.

08:58.830 --> 09:02.125
Hey. You're tough, Rebecca.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.084
Okay?

09:04.335 --> 09:05.587
It's ten days.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.588

Just... hug me.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.812
That's so sweet.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.480
Come on, girl.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.398
‐All right. Now we'll...
‐(door closes)

10:09.734 --> 10:11.694
I'm assuming
Cynthia told you that‐‐

10:11.694 --> 10:16.241
That you were
the one who alerted her
to Maddie's problem,

10:16.241 --> 10:19.202
asked her to search
her locker? Yes, she did.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.995
Charlotte:
I'm guessing you think
I'm a terrible mother.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.790
‐But you have to understand
I didn't have a choice.
‐(door opens)

10:30.255 --> 10:32.382
Thank you.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.969

10:36.970 --> 10:39.597
‐Okay. Hi.
‐Maddie.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.976
(sighs) Look. I know
you're upset about Rebecca‐‐

10:42.976 --> 10:46.354
Oh, no. I came in here
to apologize for being
so emotional.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.022
You were just trying
to do your job.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.024
‐Is everything okay?
‐Yeah, it's all good.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.402
‐You sure?
‐It's all good. I'm fine.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.783
(whimpers, shudders)

11:06.249 --> 11:08.877
I know that I did
a really dumb thing
by burying the gun‐‐

11:08.877 --> 11:10.461
Yes, you did.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.797
You know that's a violation
of your probation, correct?

11:12.797 --> 11:15.300
Which is why
I'm coming clean.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.511
I'm hoping
that by cooperating fully,

11:18.511 --> 11:21.306
you'll understand
where I'm coming from.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.309
And where is your brother
and your ex‐girlfriend?

11:24.309 --> 11:28.271
I don't know. Diesel said
they ran off together.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.232
When did you see Diesel?

11:31.232 --> 11:34.652
I didn't‐‐
I didn't see Diesel.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.863
I talked to Diesel
on the telephone.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.865
(sighs)

11:38.865 --> 11:41.868
Take us to the site
where you buried the gun.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.792
It wasn't there
last night, I swear.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.128
Maybe you were looking
in the wrong spot.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.631
No. No, I wasn't.
That's the spot.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.513
Look. You did the right thing
by coming to us. Okay?

12:02.513 --> 12:05.391
You realize my fingerprints
are gonna be all over that gun.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.769
I understand, and as far as
your probation goes,

12:07.769 --> 12:11.356
we'll alert your
probation officer to your
assistance in this matter.

12:13.024 --> 12:13.775
Okay.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.988
Oh, God.
I'm so glad you're here.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.078
(sighs)
Listen...

12:25.078 --> 12:28.373
it was a mistake,
and I'm sorry.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.459
I just...

12:31.459 --> 12:34.003
It's classic
addicts' pattern.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.297
Please, just‐‐
just give me another chance.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.842
It was a bump in the road,
and we can go to counseling.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.553
Please.
I love you so much.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.139
I love you, and I know
you still love me.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.309
Okay?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.019
(clears throat, sniffs)

12:50.019 --> 12:52.897
Miss Molina, I'm afraid
your failure to report

12:52.897 --> 12:55.483
Madeline Graham's
substance abuse problem
to myself

12:55.483 --> 12:59.362
‐is a serious infraction.
‐No. (stammers)
Don't do that. Uh‐uh.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.240
I'm afraid I'm going
to need your resignation
by the end of the day.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.077
I brought some boxes
for your belongings.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.998
(scoffs)
Are you kidding me?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.958
No, I'm afraid I'm not.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.794
Oh!

13:16.004 --> 13:18.047
God! You son of a bitch!

13:19.173 --> 13:21.342
And you are a whore.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.222
(whimpers)

13:29.851 --> 13:32.603
I strongly advise
you don't repeat
my last comment.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.855
I'll just deny it.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.523
(sobs softly)

13:37.317 --> 13:38.901
I can lie too, Cynthia.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
‐(door closes)
‐(panting)

13:55.918 --> 13:57.587
(sobs)

14:07.055 --> 14:08.347
(sobs) No.

14:16.647 --> 14:20.985
I still feel really bad about
what happened last time
I saw you guys.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.906
But, uh, I can assure you
that I'm fine now.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.450
‐Really.
‐That's good, buddy.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.743
(chuckles)

14:28.743 --> 14:30.328
Where's Rebecca?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.041
I know that it was you
giving her the Suboxone.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.713
Where is she?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.048
(sighs)

14:43.049 --> 14:45.301
She came by here
last night.

14:45.301 --> 14:49.013
She told me what happened,
and she didn't have
anywhere else to go.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.350
You have to understand,
Rebecca is‐‐

14:52.350 --> 14:55.895
I know who Rebecca is.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.525
I know her better
than anyone in the whole world.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.739
Now please just tell me,
where did she go?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.786
She said
she wanted to start over.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.622
She went to the East Coast.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.584
She wasn't sure where.
She just wanted to get
far away from here.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.961
Mm.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.004
So I gave her some money
for a bus ticket.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.590
‐I just felt bad about‐‐
‐Thank you.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.890
She said she'd call me
when she got settled.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.184
I can have her call you
or give her your number.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.185
She has it.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.318
(sighs)

15:46.070 --> 15:47.071
Thank you.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.035
So, I'll pick you up
after school.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.079
Just text me.
Oh! My phone is dead.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.123
That's fine.
I'll figure something out.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.249
‐I'll get a ride. It's okay.
‐Okay.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.042
Well...

16:00.042 --> 16:02.378
‐Hey, look at me.
‐Yeah.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.422
Chin up.
All right?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.133
Yeah.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.141
I don't know
what's going to happen next.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.976
I mean, what if
I don't stay sober?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.895
Are you contemplating using?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.938
I'm not contemplating
anything right now,

16:20.938 --> 16:22.982
except where I'm going to be
sleeping tonight.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.276
Oh, you can stay here.
Of course.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.695
Thank you.

16:29.197 --> 16:34.577
Hey, there's this place,
it's where I've been going.

16:34.577 --> 16:38.122
It's really different from AA,
but it's helped me a lot.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.209
If you want to come
with me to a meeting...

16:42.126 --> 16:43.794
Yeah, sure.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.131
They have...
some rules like, uh,

16:47.131 --> 16:50.009
about how you dress
and how you share.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.222
If you're cool with that.

16:54.222 --> 16:55.765
I'm cool with that.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.269
Thanks.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
‐Hey.
‐Hi.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.109
Hi, Maddie.
I'm glad to see you.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.028
We're glad you're here.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.366
Um... tell her.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.244
Oh, we've already talked
about the whole Zack thing.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.705
‐I mean‐‐
‐It's not that.
It's something else.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.040
Okay.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.671
Remember the Thursday night
you lost your car

17:26.671 --> 17:29.215
and I told you
I didn't know where it was?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.552
I lied.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.473
What? What are you
talking about, Nyla?
What do you mean?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.433
I felt bad that I let you
drive drunk,

17:39.433 --> 17:41.561
so I pretended not to know.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.813
‐Maddie, I'm so sorry. Okay?
‐Maddie. Maddie.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.773
‐I thought it was better
that you didn't‐‐
‐No, you don't!

17:45.773 --> 17:47.858
‐Stop.
‐You knew this whole time
and you didn't even tell me!

17:47.858 --> 17:49.485
Okay? Nyla, how could you?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.862
‐No. Don't.
‐What happened that night,
it's way worse than you think.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.198
You called me afterwards,
and you were so messed up,

17:54.198 --> 17:56.242
and I'm so sorry.
I was trying to protect you.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.120
‐Please, please‐‐
‐Don't ever speak to me again!

17:59.120 --> 18:00.705
Maddie.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.131
Hey.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.093
Wanna talk?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
Or not talk?

18:18.973 --> 18:20.141
Talk about how
we don't want to talk

18:20.141 --> 18:21.976
about all the things
we don't want to talk about?

18:23.853 --> 18:24.979
Not talk.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.733
(sighs)

18:28.733 --> 18:29.775
(doorbell)

18:32.153 --> 18:33.195
(doorbell continues)

18:33.195 --> 18:34.322
I guess I'll get the door!

18:37.992 --> 18:39.035
(doorbell continues)

18:43.289 --> 18:45.958
Hi! I'm looking
for Trish Tomlinson.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.001
Uh... Trish?

18:48.377 --> 18:49.837
‐Yeah?
‐Monica: There you are!

18:49.837 --> 18:51.464
Trish, I'm Monica Gerstenblatt,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.466
executive producer
of <i>Fool House,</i>

18:53.466 --> 18:56.636
and girlfriend, I have a very
important question to ask you.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.388
How would you like
to come and live with us

18:59.388 --> 19:00.973
at the <i>Fool House?</i>

19:02.141 --> 19:03.809
Wait, you're joking, right?

19:03.809 --> 19:06.228
No, I'm not.
It's exciting, isn't it?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.357
‐Yeah, um...
‐Good! Yes!

19:09.357 --> 19:11.942
So, I want to
see that excitement.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.569
All right? I'm gonna go out,
I'm gonna come back in,

19:13.569 --> 19:15.071
and we're gonna do this
all over again,

19:15.071 --> 19:16.864
but I want to see big energy.
Big energy, okay?

19:16.864 --> 19:17.948
‐All right!
‐Okay.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.408
All right, come on, guys!
Come on!

19:19.408 --> 19:21.118
Move it! Move it!
Can't waste time.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.995
I want to see big energy
all right? Come on.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.083
‐Trish, I really don't think‐‐
‐Vern.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.127
Back that ass up.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.213
Matter of fact,
go over there.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.970
Oh, my God!

19:39.970 --> 19:41.389
Does this mean
what I think?

19:41.389 --> 19:44.308
Oh, my God,
am I gonna be a fool?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.352
Like, on <i>Fool House?</i>

19:46.352 --> 19:48.396
(screams)

19:48.396 --> 19:49.522
(giggles)

19:51.315 --> 19:53.192
You and my mom both need to‐‐

19:54.819 --> 19:56.112
Cynthia?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.030
‐(groans)
‐Are you okay?

19:58.030 --> 20:00.741
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.993
‐Okay, okay.
‐(groans)

20:02.993 --> 20:04.912
‐(groans)
‐You're my sponsor.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.747
Why are you doing this to me?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.040
I suck, Maddie.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.500
‐I really suck.
‐Shh.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.377
I've hurt so many people‐‐

20:11.377 --> 20:12.712
Paul and Craig...

20:12.712 --> 20:14.797
‐Ethan!
‐Okay, I'm gonna call Craig.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.257
No! Don't call Craig!

20:16.257 --> 20:17.425
He hates me!

20:17.425 --> 20:18.592
He'll know what to do.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.094
Maddie, Maddie,
don't call Craig.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.263
I don't want him
to see me like this.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.389
Okay, well, then who can I call?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.307
I promise I'll do better.
All right? Okay?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.434
‐Who can I call?
‐I don't know.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.477
Cynthia? Cynthia?
Who can I call?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.687
Who's your sponsor?

20:29.687 --> 20:31.313
I don't have a sponsor.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.107
‐You don't have a sponsor.
‐No.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.358
‐You don't have a sponsor.
‐And I suck.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.152
Okay. Um...

20:39.363 --> 20:40.448
Call Gina.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.033
‐Yeah.
‐Gina.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.289
(groans)

20:49.707 --> 20:50.875
She's not in there!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.209
Where are you going?

20:52.209 --> 20:54.503
Sorry. No. She's not in there.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.337
Okay?

20:55.337 --> 20:56.338
Sorry.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.426
Okay.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.470
‐(phone ringing)
‐Come on, come on.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.804
Please, please pick up.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.139
‐Please.
‐(receiver clicks)

21:05.139 --> 21:06.182
Gina:
<i>Cynthia?</i>

21:06.182 --> 21:08.142
No, this is Maddie.
Is this‐‐ is this Gina?

21:08.142 --> 21:09.518
This is Gina.
Is Cynthia okay?

21:09.518 --> 21:11.187
No. Uh, she's drunk.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.354
Okay.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.690
She's drunk for the first time
in 12 years, all right?

21:14.690 --> 21:15.775
<i>She needs help.</i>

21:15.775 --> 21:17.026
Wow, 12 years.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.694
I never thought
she'd be able to‐‐

21:18.694 --> 21:20.488
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say that.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.406
I'm‐‐ I'm her sponsee.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.576
I'm only 30 days sober.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.952
Uh...

21:26.952 --> 21:27.995
I don't know what to do.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.415
I'm at Parsons‐Bell Academy,
where she works.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.125
Can you please come here?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.210
Where is that?

21:34.210 --> 21:35.377
It's in Valencia.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.545
California?

21:36.545 --> 21:37.922
Yes, California.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.383
Sweetheart, I'm in Miami.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.427
<i>I was Cynthia's sponsor,</i>

21:43.427 --> 21:45.387
but I haven't seen her
in a very long time.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.515
Do you know who
her current sponsor is?

21:47.515 --> 21:49.517
No, she doesn't have one.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.727
Ever classic Cynthia.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.523
Okay, here's what
you need to do.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.525
<i>Call someone you trust.</i>

21:57.525 --> 22:00.402
Yeah, well, I don't‐‐
I don't trust anybody right now.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.779
Okay?

22:01.779 --> 22:03.447
And I don't know
what to do.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.199
Okay. Maddie, calm down.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.576
I'm gonna get you
the name of som‐‐

22:07.576 --> 22:08.828
No, never mind.
You know what?

22:08.828 --> 22:09.954
I'll figure this out myself.

22:09.954 --> 22:10.996
I'll figure it out myself.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.627
Okay.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.505
Vern's voicemail:
<i>Aloha, friends and family.</i>

I need your help.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.281
Okay, Trish,
you won't listen to us,

22:45.281 --> 22:46.657
so maybe you'll
listen to your sponsor.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.658
Go ahead. Tell her.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.493
‐I think this is a bad‐‐
‐This is a terrible idea!

22:49.493 --> 22:50.619
‐Yes.
‐Okay?

22:50.619 --> 22:52.788
This reality show loads
people up with alcohol

22:52.788 --> 22:55.207
and gets them to do
and say horrible things!

22:55.207 --> 22:56.625
Embarrassing things!

22:56.625 --> 22:57.626
‐Tell her!
‐I‐‐ I‐‐

22:57.626 --> 22:59.420
And you‐‐ of course
they're gonna use you!

22:59.420 --> 23:01.505
They're gonna have you
relapse on national television

23:01.505 --> 23:03.591
to get ratings!
To humiliate you!

23:03.591 --> 23:05.259
‐Vern's right.
‐See? I'm right!

23:05.259 --> 23:06.594
Tell her I'm right!
And you know what else?

23:06.594 --> 23:08.512
You're gonna go right back
to where you started.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.848
You guys, this is my dream!

23:10.848 --> 23:15.603
I have a chance
to win $300,000!

23:15.603 --> 23:17.146
I'll come back.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.647
I promise.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.691
But you don't
understand, sweetie.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.359
You're in a very fragile state.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.486
You need to be surrounded
by people who love you,

23:24.486 --> 23:25.946
not people trying
to tear you down

23:25.946 --> 23:27.406
to win some silly prize.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.158
Can't you guys just
be happy for me?

23:32.036 --> 23:33.746
Will you do me a favor?

23:35.164 --> 23:38.542
If they ask you to do something
you're uncomfortable with,

23:38.542 --> 23:42.087
you say no
and you come back here.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.797
Okay?

23:43.797 --> 23:45.549
You're too good for that.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.677
You leave the show
and you come back to us

23:48.677 --> 23:50.679
and we will embrace you
with open arms.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.474
And while you're gone,
we'll miss you.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.809
A lot. Like...

23:55.809 --> 23:57.269
like a lot, lot.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.731
But we'll watch,

24:00.731 --> 24:03.275
and we'll cheer you on,

24:03.275 --> 24:06.654
and we'll pray for you
every day, okay?

24:06.654 --> 24:08.280
Because we love you.

24:10.741 --> 24:14.620
We got some incredible B‐roll
of the house, girlfriend.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.996
Are you as excited
about this as we are?

24:15.996 --> 24:18.082
Yep!
(laughs)

24:18.082 --> 24:20.709
$300,000 here I come.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.752
Exactly!

24:21.752 --> 24:23.712
Now, we're gonna have a car

24:23.712 --> 24:25.130
sent for you in the morning,

24:25.130 --> 24:27.466
‐and I'll make sure that
everything is taken care of.
‐Um...

24:27.466 --> 24:29.969
Actually, I think
it might be best

24:29.969 --> 24:31.512
if I can leave with you now.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.180
Is it okay?

24:35.349 --> 24:36.392
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.727
Um... I'm gonna get
some of my things

24:38.727 --> 24:41.271
from the bathroom
and I'll be back.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.608
Listen, listen,
I want to talk to you.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.653
She's not gonna make it.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.781
‐I‐‐ I mean, she's‐‐
‐Shut up, Maureen.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.032
(sighs)

24:57.079 --> 24:58.288
‐Cynthia.
‐(groans)

24:59.707 --> 25:01.792
It's me, Charlotte.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.961
We're gonna get you...
(grunts) out of here.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.963
‐(groans)
‐Okay? I pulled the car up

25:05.963 --> 25:08.632
as close as
I could get it, all right?

25:08.632 --> 25:10.092
But we're gonna
have to do some walking.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.344
‐Do you think you could do that?
‐No, I just wanna sleep.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.722
And‐‐ and you'll be able to
do that in just a few minutes.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.640
Would you like to
spend the night with me?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.891
Huh?

25:17.891 --> 25:20.019
I'll make you dinner
and we can...

25:20.019 --> 25:22.104
stay up... and talk.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.522
‐No!
‐It'll be like a slumber party.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.982
It just‐‐ Paul and‐‐

25:24.982 --> 25:26.775
we‐‐ Craig and‐‐

25:26.775 --> 25:28.277
‐Okay, we're gonna
talk all about it...
‐I can't.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.571
...but first, we're gonna
get you in the car.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.655
‐Okay?
‐Craig hates me.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.740
You probably hate me.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.742
‐You do hate me.
‐Don't be stupid, Cynthia.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.577
I don't hate you.
Now pull it together, bitch.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.786
No, I'm just gonna take a nap.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.246
(groans)

25:39.246 --> 25:42.166
(sighs)
How's your upper body strength?

25:42.166 --> 25:44.126
‐Why is she so‐‐
‐She's having a heat stroke.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.669
‐We're taking her
to the hospital.
‐All right.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.129
Ma, it's not even hot out.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.172
‐Okay‐‐
‐(groans)

25:48.172 --> 25:49.506
‐Oh!
‐(groans)

25:49.506 --> 25:50.758
Turn around.

25:50.758 --> 25:51.550
Her elbow hit me!

25:52.801 --> 25:53.886
(grunts)

25:53.886 --> 25:55.804
‐Jeez, Mom!
‐Whoa!

25:55.804 --> 25:56.847
(sighs)

25:56.847 --> 25:59.600
‐Okay.
‐Okay, here we go.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.018
Careful of her head.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.686
And mine.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.605
Gosh, Cynthia.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.776
‐Hey, that was
pretty impressive.
‐(sighs)

26:08.776 --> 26:10.444
‐Thank you.
‐(chuckles)

26:13.489 --> 26:15.991
Maddie, I need to‐‐

26:15.991 --> 26:17.618
We call that being of service.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.246
In the program.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.834
Sometimes you just, you know,

26:25.834 --> 26:27.211
have to help someone

26:27.211 --> 26:29.046
who needs it...

26:29.046 --> 26:30.589
even with brute strength.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.051
Sometimes we even drag them
kicking and screaming.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.806
And sometimes
we even use deceit.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.685
But sometimes...

26:43.685 --> 26:47.231
we just have to
get the person in the car.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.358
Okay.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.859
‐Oh!
‐Oh‐‐ What are you‐‐
what are you doing?

26:50.859 --> 26:52.820
No, no, no, no, no!
You‐‐ Okay.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.196
That's gross.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.698
All right, so go have
a slumber party with my sponsor,

26:56.698 --> 26:58.075
because that's not weird.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.703
All right‐‐ Oops.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.621
Okay.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.416
I'm gonna take her keys.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.671
Correction.
I'm gonna take her car.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.674
She can have it back
when she's completed
90 days of sobriety.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.637
Can I just‐‐

27:24.685 --> 27:26.019
‐How are you feeling?
‐(groans)

27:28.522 --> 27:29.815
Oh, thanks.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.657
(groans)

27:41.285 --> 27:42.744
12 years.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.330
I had 12 years.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.917
And you'll have many,
many more to go.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.751
Yeah.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.756
God.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.758
I've hurt so many people.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.849
I‐‐ I‐‐ I can't be here.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.726
I‐‐ one relapse after another.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.561
There's just
too many memories.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.854
‐I‐‐
‐Cynthia!

28:08.854 --> 28:10.105
Take a breath.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.817
Falling down is
part of recovery.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.778
It's part of life.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.906
I‐‐ I‐‐ I can't do this here.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.490
I‐‐ I need a fresh start.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.619
I'm moving to California.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.953
Oh, a geographic.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.582
Honey, you know this don't work.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.417
Look what happened to Miranda.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.002
Or Kevin.

28:32.002 --> 28:35.339
Our problem follows us.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.591
Wherever you go...

28:37.591 --> 28:38.842
there you are.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.764
I have to.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.016
I need a fresh start.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.102
Alone.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.855
What do you mean "alone"?

28:51.855 --> 28:53.774
What about Ethan?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.654
Cynthia!

28:58.654 --> 29:00.364
What about Ethan?

29:00.364 --> 29:01.573
I can't.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.914
All hail the conquering hero.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.874
You won? That's great, baby.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.836
Oh! Ick. You're sweaty.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.421
Yes. Why, yes I am, Mom.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.423
Maybe a little bloody too.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.466
Icky‐ky.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.926
Why are you looking at airfare?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.470
I have to go to California.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.014
It's your mother.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.476
She's not‐‐

29:29.476 --> 29:30.894
‐is she...
‐Oh! No, baby.

29:30.894 --> 29:31.937
She's okay.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.440
Can I come?

29:36.692 --> 29:37.901
If you'd like to.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.671
I need to apologize.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.172
I think I've been
a little tough on you.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.217
You don't need to
make any apologies.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.389
I was your daughter's sponsor,
and she found me drunk.

30:09.850 --> 30:10.892
But yeah,

30:10.892 --> 30:13.895
by the way,
I've been sponsoring Maddie.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.272
‐Secretly.
‐I know.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.983
Oh, my God.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.944
I'm so sorry.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.406
You encouraged her.

30:25.741 --> 30:26.825
You empowered her.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.914
You gave her the support
I didn't know how to,

30:32.914 --> 30:34.666
so I will always
be grateful for that.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.546
You're a good mom.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.799
I'm gonna be.
I'm learning.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.887
You said to me
a couple of weeks ago

30:46.887 --> 30:48.930
that I didn't know
what it was like
to be a mother.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.977
You're right, I don't.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.023
But I have a son.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.571
And I was
a terrible mother, so I‐‐

31:04.571 --> 31:06.656
I‐‐ I think that's
another story

31:06.656 --> 31:08.658
for a‐‐ another time.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.744
Okay?

31:12.954 --> 31:14.456
Yeah. Thank you.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.168
(sighs)

31:18.168 --> 31:20.128
What do you mean she left?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.379
And you let her?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.381
Mrs. Granger,
Rebecca is an adult.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.217
She doesn't need permission
to discharge herself.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.385
The contract I signed said that

31:27.385 --> 31:29.679
we were to be
notified immediately.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.515
Yes, but it all happened
rather abruptly I'm afraid.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.892
(emphatically)
Where is my daughter?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.394
(emphatically)
Regrettably, I don't know.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.771
Then you need to find her.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.106
Yeah, okay.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.400
With all due respect now,
this is the first time

31:42.400 --> 31:44.611
you've ever even been here,
so excuse me if I seem

31:44.611 --> 31:46.530
a little befuddled
by the sudden interest

31:46.530 --> 31:47.948
in your daughter's whereabouts,

31:47.948 --> 31:49.533
or for that matter, well being.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.370
Let me explain
something to you.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.331
There seems to be
this misconception

31:56.331 --> 32:00.252
that my husband is this
powerful man in our community

32:00.252 --> 32:04.923
and that I am this dutiful wife
who cowers in his shadow

32:04.923 --> 32:06.258
with a smile on my face.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.051
Well, let me be clear.

32:09.511 --> 32:12.973
Everything my husband has
is because of me.

32:12.973 --> 32:17.102
Everything my family has
is because of me.

32:17.102 --> 32:20.605
Dr. Marcus Granger
is not to be feared.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.815
I am.

32:23.316 --> 32:28.196
Now, unless you find my daughter
in the next 48 hours,

32:28.196 --> 32:33.451
I will systematically
erase this dump from existence,

32:33.451 --> 32:35.662
brick by brick.

32:35.662 --> 32:40.041
And then I will make sure
that you never work again.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.172
(scoffs)

32:47.174 --> 32:48.717
Wow.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.763
I need you to please leave.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.183
You have 48 hours.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.185
Get the hell out
of my house right now.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.857
You've made a horrible mistake.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.321
(door opens)

33:09.321 --> 33:10.780
(door closes)

33:15.911 --> 33:18.705
Maddie the morbid
mortician meditates in‐‐

33:22.250 --> 33:23.793
I'm really sorry. I‐‐

33:23.793 --> 33:25.921
No, it's‐‐ it's okay.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.799
Dad, this is Wes.
Wes, this is my dad.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.803
I realized something today.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
We were here
a couple of weeks ago

33:36.014 --> 33:37.432
and I didn't even...

33:37.432 --> 33:39.184
come to my father's grave.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.352
Who even does that?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.438
Maddie, it was a weird day.

33:43.438 --> 33:46.024
We were both in
a different headspace.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.400
Don't read too much into it.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.652
And I have been

33:48.652 --> 33:51.238
so self‐centered
and self‐absorbed.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.657
No, you haven't.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.369
Quite the opposite.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.913
Trish, Rebecca, me.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.290
Yeah, well Trish hates me,
Rebecca's gonna, and you‐‐

34:02.290 --> 34:03.333
I'm here.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.336
Yes, you are here.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.051
I don't know if I'm a virgin.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.097
I mean...

34:17.097 --> 34:19.140
I may have had sex
during a blackout,

34:19.140 --> 34:20.934
but I don't know,
and I found out today

34:20.934 --> 34:23.144
that my friend,
who said she didn't know,

34:23.144 --> 34:26.231
actually probably does know
if I did or didn't.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.026
I went to go talk to my sponsor,
but she was wasted...

34:30.026 --> 34:32.237
and I couldn't find Rebecca.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.072
I think she's gone.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.451
I wonder if I'll ever
see her again and I‐‐

34:38.451 --> 34:40.161
God, I like you, Wes.

34:41.663 --> 34:45.333
Like, I‐‐ I really like you.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.383
I'm on probation.

34:53.383 --> 34:54.718
Minor drug offense.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.013
But today I lied
to the police.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.308
I told them
I hadn't seen Diesel

35:01.308 --> 35:03.435
'cause it would have been
a violation of my probation

35:03.435 --> 35:05.604
because he's a known felon,
and I'm not allowed

35:05.604 --> 35:07.147
to consort with felons.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.319
And I really, really
like you too, Maddie.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.987
Like, I really like you.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.487
And guess what?

37:20.780 --> 37:21.990
I wanted to drink.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.325
And smoke a joint.

Goes by Diesel.
