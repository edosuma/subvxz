11:02.536 --> 11:04.455
Hey, Lindsay.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.833
[whistles] I have a secret for you.

11:07.917 --> 11:08.876
[all laughing]

11:08.959 --> 11:10.961
Bill Clinton was the guy in the garage?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.630
[woman] Looks like
a young Henry Kissinger.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.507
-[camper 1] What's going on?
-[camper 2] What did we miss?

11:14.590 --> 11:15.883
[camper 3] The presidents pretended
to nuke the camp.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.967
[camper 2] That makes sense.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.970
So, wait. It wasn't a real missile?

11:20.054 --> 11:23.724
It was a real missile,
but I armed it with a confetti payload.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.227
-[Ben] Oh, okay.
-Gene was real.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.020
Gene was a real man,

11:28.104 --> 11:30.606
and I saw him die
at the hands of Nurse Nancy.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.982
[Nancy] No, you didn't!

11:33.484 --> 11:36.153
Gene! Oh, Gene.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.030
But I watched you kill him!

11:38.114 --> 11:40.616
Correction. You watched me perform

11:40.699 --> 11:44.078
a much-needed adjustment
on his C3 vertebrae.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.122
-I haven't felt this limber in years.
-[all chuckle]

11:46.205 --> 11:49.417
But I killed you!
Look at you. You're covered in blood.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.751
That was just ketchup.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.044
[all laughing]

11:52.128 --> 11:54.046
All right, wait a minute.
None of this is real?

11:54.130 --> 11:57.091
I mean, I put together
a cracker jack team to stop a nuke.

11:57.174 --> 12:01.846
That's right, Gene. You did that.
And now you're home again.

12:01.929 --> 12:06.767
And there's a young lady here
who'd like to meet you.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.935
Daddy!

12:08.602 --> 12:10.020
[chuckles]

12:10.104 --> 12:11.230
[sighs]

12:13.482 --> 12:15.860
Daddy? What does she mean...

12:17.778 --> 12:18.904
Daddy?

12:20.114 --> 12:23.075
-Hey! Now I get it!
-[all laughing and cheering]

12:23.159 --> 12:27.246
-We have so much catching up to do!
-Yeah!

12:27.329 --> 12:29.707
Now I can be with my mommy and my daddy!

12:29.790 --> 12:31.167
-That's me!
-Yes!

12:31.250 --> 12:32.877
[all cheering]

12:34.420 --> 12:38.340
Wait, what about the lady who tried
to buy the camp for ten million dollars?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.177
Well, actually,
she's a really great actress

12:41.260 --> 12:43.637
-and her name is Gloria Culpepper.
-[all applauding]

12:43.721 --> 12:45.181
Gloria, are you here?

12:45.806 --> 12:48.392
There she is. Oh, hey, Gloria.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.269
[chuckles]

12:50.352 --> 12:53.939
This was the role of a lifetime.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.649
[Blake] Great work. Great work.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.860
Okay, but I found Vivian.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.445
-[Reagan] Absolutely.
-In that house

12:59.528 --> 13:00.988
with the paranoid guy and his wife.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.700
Well, uh, why don't you just say hello
to Sheryl Blaysdale, Connor Mitchum,

13:04.783 --> 13:07.536
and Erika Johnson
from the Groundlings Sunday Company?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.456
-Thanks for letting us play with you.
-[Coop] You were great.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.876
I got a bunch of comp cards with me,
if anyone's interested in my range.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.044
[Sheryl] And just an FYI,

13:15.127 --> 13:19.048
I'm doing my one-woman show,
Goofball Diaries,

13:19.131 --> 13:21.842
in the main stage, Tuesday, at 6:00 p.m.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.302
[all cheering]

13:24.803 --> 13:28.265
President Reagan, were you really
Willie-Shits-His-Pants?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.226
Nope. [chuckles]

13:30.309 --> 13:32.937
-I never even went to camp.
-[Bush laughing]

13:33.020 --> 13:38.817
I have the photo from camp, 1921,
with your name right here on the bottom.

13:38.901 --> 13:43.531
Lindsay, what you have there is an example
of my handiwork with Liquid Paper.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.074
-Take another look.
-Wha...

13:45.157 --> 13:47.535
-I cannot believe I missed it.
-[all laughing]

13:47.618 --> 13:50.204
Okay, wait. Why did you and Reagan
have all those meetings

13:50.287 --> 13:52.039
without anyone in the camp
even witnessing?

13:52.122 --> 13:55.376
Great question, Agent.
We had to keep the ruse up,

13:55.459 --> 13:59.505
even in front of the Secret Service,
to make sure it was airtight.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.257
-[all] Oh!
-Got you.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.135
Every beat of this
was planned and scripted.

14:05.219 --> 14:10.641
Well, shitting on the water-ski model,
now that was a little bit of an ad-lib.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.351
[Clinton] A little improv off the script.

14:12.434 --> 14:19.024
And I want to give a very special thanks
to a wonderful gal, Julie Levinson,

14:19.108 --> 14:21.777
a graduate student at Juilliard School,

14:21.861 --> 14:26.365
who gave a bravura performance
as Renata, the psycho nanny.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.869
-Julie, come out here and take a bow.
-[all cheering and applauding]

14:32.413 --> 14:33.664
[Clinton] She's so talented.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.043
[Reagan] Julie? Julie, come on out.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.463
You've earned it.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.593
-We have to say something.
-No, we don't. Never.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.387
Julie?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.681
Immediately after this,
we're gonna chop up her body.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.683
-[Reagan] Julie?
-I'll bury one hand in the soccer field.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.184
You throw one hand in the lake.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.313
We'll burn the torso. We'll take the head
home with us in the car.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.648
We'll scatter her teeth
along the Merritt Parkway.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.567
-What?
-[Reagan] Julie?

15:01.650 --> 15:04.111
[Clinton] Not here.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.239
Okay, wait.
So, was the camp sold or not?

15:07.323 --> 15:12.453
Actually, that part was not a game.
I did legally buy the camp from Beth.

15:12.536 --> 15:17.207
But there is someone here who is much more
qualified than I to run Camp Firewood.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.794
And the new owner should be someone
who will respect the values

15:20.878 --> 15:24.173
and continue the traditions
that make Firewood so special.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.216
And that new person is...

15:26.300 --> 15:28.052
[all whispering indistinctly]

15:30.387 --> 15:31.889
Howard and Debbie Fortner.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.849
[all cheering]

15:36.393 --> 15:39.188
Howard and Debbie have owned
several camps over the years,

15:39.271 --> 15:42.483
and they've shown a long-term commitment
to the summer camp experience.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.862
I know they're gonna make great
new captains to the U.S.S. Camp Firewood.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.865
We're so excited to be
a part of the Firewood tradition.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.828
Gary, I would like to take the money
I made from the sale of this camp

15:54.912 --> 15:56.997
and give it to you
to start your own restaurant.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.876
I'll handle the financing,
you just cook your flavors.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.253
Wait, are you serious?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.298
Absolutely. This is the new direction
I've been looking for.

16:07.091 --> 16:10.469
Just promise to serve
that mac and cheese two ways.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.888
-This is a dream come true!
-[all] Aw.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.057
And obviously,
I'll need a chef de cuisine.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.686
And I know just the man to ask.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.813
It would be my honor.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.565
One thing I know I'll need
is a front-of-house manager.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.775
Nance, what do you say?

16:24.858 --> 16:28.320
I say, yes! A thousand times, yes!

16:28.404 --> 16:30.656
Just don't be stingy with your chiropraxy.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.449
[all laughing]

16:33.033 --> 16:36.161
You better get cooking.
Your grand opening is one week from today.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.579
-[laughs] Oh, my! I've got a lot to do.
-Okay!

16:37.663 --> 16:39.331
[all cheering]

16:39.415 --> 16:41.834
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Thinking this through,

16:41.917 --> 16:45.713
why did you actually buy the camp
if you knew you weren't gonna destroy it?

16:45.796 --> 16:46.714
[all] Yeah.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.507
-[man] What's up with that?
-[Reagan] Good question.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.009
That's a great question.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.678
Yeah, and what about
when my co-workers were sort of

16:52.761 --> 16:55.472
part of a conspiracy of silence
and chased me out of my office?

16:55.556 --> 16:58.058
-What was that about?
-[Bush] Where is the beef? [laughs]

16:58.142 --> 16:59.727
I count on you
to ask that kind of question.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.312
How did you know
that Ginny would leave Coop

17:02.396 --> 17:03.564
or that Garth would leave Susie?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.691
Did Greg actually control
real satellites...

17:05.773 --> 17:07.776
How were you able to build
a fully operational bunker?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.444
What is the point of faking Gene's death?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.155
Why did you involve President Bush at all?

17:11.238 --> 17:14.074
-[Blake] What was the deal with the mole?
-Did you authorize satcom...

17:14.157 --> 17:15.701
I don't understand any of this.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.037
How did you fake a giant laser
shooting out of the totem?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.663
These are all great questions,

17:19.747 --> 17:21.790
and we want to answer
every single one of them,

17:21.874 --> 17:22.708
and we will.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.295
But first, I think we're all
probably pretty hungry.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.212
-[all agreeing]
-I know I am.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.131
[Reagan] And it's been a long night.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.758
We have a whole bunch of pizzas...

17:30.841 --> 17:33.177
-[all cheering]
-...from Mario's.

17:33.260 --> 17:37.097
So, why don't you guys come along
and we'll talk about all this.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:09.755 --> 18:12.800
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm late.
I thought we said 9:30.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.219
No, we said 9:00
so we could be here by 9:30.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.179
[indistinct chatter]

18:17.262 --> 18:19.598
[Claire] When we get back to the city,
if you're okay with it,

18:19.681 --> 18:20.974
I've got somebody
I want to set you up with.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.768
-[McKinley] Love the haircut, Gary.
-Thanks.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.729
Gonna be running my own restaurant,
so I got Neil to cut my hair.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.773
It's very '90s.
Hey, you guys, can we do this?

18:27.856 --> 18:30.150
It's almost 9:45, and as I said,
I have some place to be at 11:00.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.319
-[Ben] Oh, God, where do you have to be?
-Where you got to be?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.029
McKinley, tell us.
We're all dying to know.

18:34.113 --> 18:34.947
[all] Yeah!

18:35.030 --> 18:39.076
Okay, I'll tell you,
but you cannot tell a soul.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.452
-It's--
-[Nancy] Okay, everyone.

18:40.536 --> 18:45.457
On three, say "Firewood."
One, two, three.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.543
[all] Firewood!

18:47.626 --> 18:48.794
[camera shutter clicks]

18:56.093 --> 18:57.636
[indistinct chatter]

19:01.890 --> 19:04.643
Table 36.
I need that demi-glaze panna cotta.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.898
Oui, mon capitaine!
ImmÃ©diatement! Tout suite!

19:10.691 --> 19:14.319
Demi-glaze panna cotta  sauce framboise!

19:14.403 --> 19:16.572
And now,
just back from her first assignment

19:16.655 --> 19:19.533
as our new chief foreign affairs
hard news investigative reporter,

19:19.616 --> 19:22.119
-Lindsay Handelman. Lindsay?
-Thanks, Chuck.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.829
Today in international news,

19:23.912 --> 19:27.166
Latvia restores its independence
from the Soviet Union.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.878
I have to say,
she's doing a hell of a job.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.212
She's pretty amazing, huh?

19:32.296 --> 19:33.672
[Lindsay] What does this mean for the yen?

19:33.755 --> 19:36.300
-And what does this mean for you?
-[phone rings]

19:36.383 --> 19:37.593
Firewood Grille.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.846
No, we're, uh, closed for a private event.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.890
-[speaking indistinctly]
-[Nancy] Bon appÃ©tit.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.391
[all laugh]

19:45.225 --> 19:46.894
Susie, I'm so glad you could make it.

19:46.977 --> 19:50.272
Me, too. Worked out great.
We're scouting in the Bronx for my movie.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.774
We got financing
and we start shooting in two weeks.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.569
-Oh, you got financing. From who?
-Beth!

19:55.652 --> 19:56.528
[all cheering]

19:56.612 --> 19:59.781
-So, is Garth still in it?
-No, we found a much better lead.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.785
Someone who I think is going to be
a very, very big star.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.288
-Who is it?
-Come on out!

20:06.371 --> 20:07.289
[Logan] Hey!

20:07.372 --> 20:09.708
[all] Logan St. Bogan!

20:09.791 --> 20:13.587
Of course. He was the guy
who I don't think I ever met.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.505
-Thank you.
-[woman] Great. I love him.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.633
[indistinct chatter]

20:19.009 --> 20:20.802
I keep seeing her eyes.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.013
This is our life now.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.516
Mark, so you and Claire
are trying to work it out?

20:26.600 --> 20:29.228
Yeah, with a little help
from some experts.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.647
They are on tape 5 of 16.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.731
It's really working.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.692
Hey, everybody!

20:35.776 --> 20:38.362
The  New York Times  food critic review
is in.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.405
-[woman] Oh, I love him.
-[Coop] What does he say?

20:40.489 --> 20:41.740
He says, "Very delicious.''

20:41.823 --> 20:43.242
-Oh, my God!
-[all cheering]

20:45.202 --> 20:46.995
Write-ups like these are very rare.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.872
They are reserved
for the best of the best.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.959
-[Katie] They are! That's great.
-[J.J.] Congratulations, everybody.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.379
Hey, J.J., what did you do
with all that footage you shot last week?

20:55.462 --> 20:58.924
I cut it into a documentary.
I submitted a rough cut to Sundance.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.342
Should be hearing from them pretty soon.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.219
-[Susie] It's hard to get into Sundance.
-[pager rings]

21:03.387 --> 21:05.264
-I got into Sundance!
-[all gasping and applauding]

21:07.266 --> 21:11.311
-[Mark] Hey, Gary, what's in this salad?
-They're called round mauve eggplants.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.813
-They're from China.
-Mauve. Of course!

21:12.896 --> 21:15.899
Mauve is the new fall color.
This is just the inspiration I needed.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.151
I need to call the office.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.820
-I knew you'd crack it.
-[Beth] Who's that guy?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.989
Hey, hey, hey.
That's all great news and all,

21:22.072 --> 21:25.200
but we're kind of in the middle of
a wedding reception party here. [chuckles]

21:25.284 --> 21:26.827
-Huh, am I right?
-We are.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.078
I'd like to make a toast.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.748
To the newlyweds, Victor and Abby!

21:31.832 --> 21:34.668
-[all] To Victor and Abby!
-[J.J.] Hear, hear!

21:34.751 --> 21:37.671
[Beth] Look at us, ten years later.

21:37.754 --> 21:43.135
And we have survived a fake nuke blast
that I only partially understand.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.761
Some of us are pregnant.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.013
-It's a  yeled.
-[all] Aw.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.931
Some of us are making amends.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.434
-Hey, sorry we're late.
-[Katie] Andy!

21:50.517 --> 21:55.063
Um, this is Tracy and our son, Nathan.

21:55.981 --> 22:00.444
We've had some bumps,
but, uh, we're gonna give it a go.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.946
-[Beth] That's wonderful. Second chances.
-That's great.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.740
I'm gonna take off. See you.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.202
[door opens and closes]

22:09.286 --> 22:11.163
Some of us are breaking the glass ceiling.

22:11.246 --> 22:15.334
The fall color is a hit.
I've been promoted to senior VP!

22:15.417 --> 22:16.585
[all cheering]

22:16.668 --> 22:17.669
Some of us are finding--

22:17.753 --> 22:21.298
Some of us made tons of money.
Beth, I'm talking about you.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.633
-Well, I'm doing okay.
-[all cheering]

22:23.717 --> 22:25.719
Walla-walla-hoo!

22:25.802 --> 22:27.054
[all] Walla-walla-hey!

22:27.137 --> 22:30.766
-Kim-chu-ay!
-[all] Chu-ay!

22:30.849 --> 22:36.313
Oh, all of us will be forever changed
by this amazing camp reunion.

22:36.396 --> 22:40.776
And so I toast to all of you,
and I toast to Camp Firewood.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.570
-[all] To Camp Firewood!
-[cheering]

22:48.366 --> 22:51.578
"The rest of us raised our glasses
into the air as well.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.331
Then we all said, 'To Camp Firewood.'

22:54.414 --> 22:57.209
And then, we ate."

22:58.293 --> 22:59.586
[Laura sighs]

23:00.712 --> 23:01.713
[cries] Oh.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.175
This story is incredible.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.511
The three presidents,

23:07.594 --> 23:10.847
the confetti warhead,
the underground bunker?

23:10.931 --> 23:13.141
-I know.
-The talking can of vegetables,

23:13.225 --> 23:15.268
the toxic waste, Skylab?

23:15.352 --> 23:16.812
I know. Crazy, right?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.314
-And this all really happened?
-[sighs]

23:19.397 --> 23:23.568
Well, I mean, what if I told you
that I just went to my camp reunion

23:23.652 --> 23:26.488
and saw some old friends
and had a few laughs, and that was it?

23:26.571 --> 23:27.864
Would that be more believable?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.034
-Yes.
-But not as compelling, right?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.994
-Right.
-So you tell me.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.412
Which story do you want to hear?

23:35.122 --> 23:36.206
[chuckles]

23:38.708 --> 23:41.169
And everyone gets to live
happily ever after.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.173
Everyone but me. I mean, I'm all alone.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.803
-So...
-Well, you know what they say.

23:51.721 --> 23:56.434
[sighs] Sometimes the thing
you've been searching for

23:56.518 --> 23:58.395
was right in front of you the whole time.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.730
[chuckles] Laura?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.316
But...

24:04.151 --> 24:05.527
But you're my editor.

24:06.361 --> 24:09.114
-And my best friend.
-The book is finished.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.201
It's time for us to start
a new chapter... together.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.370
As co-authors.

24:15.453 --> 24:20.959
Yes, as co-authors
of this crazy book we call life.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.796
-Oh, my God, you've made me so happy.
-Oh!

24:26.506 --> 24:28.758
[Laura moaning]

24:32.637 --> 24:34.389
I do have one more question.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.099
What?

24:36.183 --> 24:38.810
Where did McKinley have to be at 11:00?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.438
[chuckles] That's an interesting story.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.689
Oh, I can't wait.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.985
So, when McKinley says
that he wants to be there at 11:00, right?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.240
