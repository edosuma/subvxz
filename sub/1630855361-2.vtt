00:04.416 --> 00:05.458
<i>I'm Nick Fury.</i>

00:05.458 --> 00:07.333
<i>Been riding a desk for the past six years</i>

00:07.333 --> 00:09.833
<i>trying to figure out where
our future enemies are coming from.</i>

00:09.833 --> 00:11.500
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.291
Never occurred to me
they would be coming from above.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.291
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

00:18.291 --> 00:19.916
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

00:20.416 --> 00:21.416
<i>Shapeshifters.</i>

00:21.416 --> 00:23.166
<i>We can't trust anyone.</i>

00:23.166 --> 00:24.458
<i>Not even our own men.</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:27.833
Now I stand before you
as my true self.

00:28.708 --> 00:29.833
Without deception.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.458
<i>I just wanna talk.</i>

00:32.375 --> 00:35.791
<i>My people lived as refugees, homeless.</i>

00:35.791 --> 00:37.500
Talos!
- Soren.

00:38.416 --> 00:42.875
<i>And the handful of us that are left
will be slaughtered next.</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:45.916
There are thousands of us
separated from each other.

00:45.916 --> 00:47.833
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

00:54.291 --> 00:55.500
They won't be safe here.

00:56.583 --> 00:57.875
<i>They need their own home.</i>

01:37.250 --> 01:39.416
Varra. Welcome.

01:39.416 --> 01:40.583
Thank you, Fury.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.833
I'd like you to meet someone.

01:44.416 --> 01:45.625
This is Gravik.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.625
Gravik.

01:54.875 --> 01:58.208
His parents were killed
in the last stand against the Kree.

01:58.208 --> 02:04.041
He escaped from behind enemy lines,
piloted a ship all on his own.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.208
He is smart, Fury. Knows how to survive.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.291
We could use someone like him.

02:10.291 --> 02:11.541
He's a child.

02:12.375 --> 02:13.833
Only to human eyes.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.791
Just talk to him.

02:26.166 --> 02:29.791
Gravik. Sorry to hear about your parents.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.708
They died a brilliant death.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.625
I'm sure they did.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.750
This work here...

02:39.666 --> 02:41.916
you know it's very dangerous.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.250
I'm not afraid.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.583
I can see you're not.

03:00.666 --> 03:05.166
I wanna thank you all for...
For joining me.

03:06.666 --> 03:09.416
I know it's been a...
It's been a rough journey.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.458
We went looking for a home,
found nothing but violence.

03:17.541 --> 03:18.541
And hate.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.333
All of us have lost someone.

03:23.875 --> 03:24.875
Or everyone.

03:26.333 --> 03:32.500
And our entire species
is scattered across the galaxy,

03:32.500 --> 03:37.041
but for those of you
who braved the journey here to Earth,

03:37.041 --> 03:41.083
you did so for one reason.

03:43.541 --> 03:44.708
This man.

03:47.041 --> 03:50.375
This man that I trust.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.291
You know I don't use that word lightly.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.083
Thank you, Talos.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.916
My friends, ever since...

04:03.916 --> 04:05.000
Let me rephrase that.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.458
Almost ever since I met Talos,

04:09.250 --> 04:13.416
I believed that humans
and Skrulls can help each other.

04:16.541 --> 04:20.166
The world is facing a serious threat.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.750
And I could use your help.

04:22.916 --> 04:26.791
It would mean putting on a new face

04:28.083 --> 04:29.458
and keeping it.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.541
This is the promise.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.750
While you work to keep my home safe,

04:38.500 --> 04:42.750
Carol Danvers and I
will find you a new one.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.958
Who'll be first to take the pledge?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.125
Thank you, Soren.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.333
You have a courageous mother, G'iah.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.416
You keep your word...

05:35.583 --> 05:36.791
I'll keep mine.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.791
What are you doing?

06:26.291 --> 06:27.541
Let go of me.

06:27.541 --> 06:31.875
I'm an American!
I'm an American! I'm an American!

06:46.791 --> 06:47.875
I'm an American!

09:45.250 --> 09:46.333
They've gone.

10:03.416 --> 10:05.208
You hear anything from G'iah yet?

10:06.333 --> 10:07.750
No, nothing. Not yet.

10:23.166 --> 10:28.291
When me and my mama used to
take these long train rides to Detroit...

10:29.500 --> 10:32.875
You know, train travel back then
wasn't nowhere near this elegant.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.333
Comin' out of Alabama,
we always had to ride in the colored car.

10:38.500 --> 10:43.208
It was hot, sweaty.
Bathroom didn't work half the time.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.583
And we couldn't go in the dining car.

10:48.625 --> 10:54.875
So, we brought fried chicken, white bread,
deviled eggs, and pound cake in a shoebox.

10:57.416 --> 11:01.791
Mmm. Half hour after the train pulled out,
that chicken be gone!

11:01.791 --> 11:04.000
Smelt way too good to wait.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.625
On these long rides,

11:06.625 --> 11:12.541
me and my mother would make up games,
pass the time.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.541
"Tell Me Somethin' I Don't Know."

11:14.541 --> 11:17.458
That was one of her favorites.

11:17.458 --> 11:23.958
One time she said, "Tell me somethin'
I don't know about you and Suzie."

11:24.625 --> 11:29.250
Me and Suzie had a standing game of doctor
we'd been playin'

11:29.250 --> 11:31.375
behind Old Man Jackson's barn.

11:31.375 --> 11:35.125
Suffice it to say,
I wasn't about to tell her about that.

11:35.958 --> 11:38.708
So, I made up something crazy like,

11:38.708 --> 11:42.041
"Me and Suzie
saw a bullfrog with polka dots."

11:43.125 --> 11:44.666
My mama just smiled.

11:44.666 --> 11:47.541
Even though I'd lied through my teeth,

11:49.041 --> 11:51.083
the mere fact that I did that,

11:51.083 --> 11:56.000
told her everything she needed to know
about me and Suzie.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.000
Mmm.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.833
Well, you wanna go a few rounds?

12:05.083 --> 12:06.125
Sure.

12:10.166 --> 12:14.583
Tell me something I don't know
about the destruction of Skrullos.

12:15.916 --> 12:20.916
You know everything
there is to know about it, Fury.

12:21.500 --> 12:26.750
Name of the game
is Tell Me Something I Don't Know.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.250
We were overpowered by the Kree.
We held 'em off for as long as we could.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.208
When we couldn't hold 'em off any longer,

12:36.208 --> 12:40.291
the million of us that were left, we fled.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.333
Interesting.

12:43.291 --> 12:48.916
Tell me something I don't know
about the Skrulls that fled.

12:51.708 --> 12:52.750
Um...

12:54.541 --> 12:55.541
They're here.

12:56.833 --> 12:57.875
Who's here?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.583
All of us.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.791
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:02.791 --> 13:08.541
You're tellin' me there's a million
Skrulls walking amongst us right now?

13:08.541 --> 13:11.916
Have you lost your reptilian-ass mind?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.291
I sent out the call

13:14.041 --> 13:19.208
and every Skrull that isn't
in Emperor Drogge's colony, they answered.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.541
You lied to me!

13:22.333 --> 13:25.583
Hey, we were being hunted
across the universe.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.041
I had two choices,

13:27.041 --> 13:30.916
I could let my people be annihilated
or summon 'em here to Earth.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.875
- What would you have done?
- This ain't about me!

13:32.875 --> 13:36.083
Oh, right. But you're fine using us
as your spies and your errand boys,

13:36.083 --> 13:37.333
long as it's on your terms.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.625
The host gets to set the terms
of the visitation.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.375
What happens
when the host disappears, huh?

13:43.375 --> 13:44.625
'Cause you were gone!

13:44.625 --> 13:47.416
And I didn't think you were coming back,
I really didn't.

13:47.416 --> 13:49.333
And even when you did come back,

13:49.333 --> 13:51.833
there was no talking to you
about anything real.

13:51.833 --> 13:54.250
Your boots barely hit Earth.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.125
And, "Oh, it's too heavy here, man.
I gotta go up to my space station."

13:59.125 --> 14:00.791
You've been up there for years!

14:00.791 --> 14:02.750
You knew how to get
in touch with me, Talos,

14:02.750 --> 14:06.791
and you didn't
because you didn't want me to know.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.000
My hope...
My hope is that with your help...

14:13.541 --> 14:16.125
Skrulls and humans can coexist,
here on Earth.

14:16.125 --> 14:20.166
Human can't coexist with each other!
You've been here long enough to know that!

14:20.166 --> 14:23.750
We've been at war with each other
since we could walk upright!

14:23.750 --> 14:28.416
There is not enough room or tolerance
on this planet for another species!

14:32.875 --> 14:35.333
Matter of fact,
neither is this train compartment.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.791
I think this is your stop.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.666
Oh, my God.

16:00.583 --> 16:01.958
Elizabeth.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.083
Were you there?

16:06.083 --> 16:07.083
Yeah.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.916
How did it happen?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.458
It happened quickly.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.416
Don't you be one of those bastards
who gives me a platitude

16:20.416 --> 16:22.125
when I'm looking for the truth!

16:24.000 --> 16:26.500
That one, over there.
You know what he told me?

16:26.500 --> 16:29.958
He told me that
my nation owes me a debt of gratitude.

16:29.958 --> 16:34.125
But he won't even tell me where
on Planet Earth my daughter was killed.

16:34.916 --> 16:38.708
So apparently, facts are not included
in the debt I'm owed.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.708
She died in Moscow.

16:44.708 --> 16:46.750
We were there trying to stop the attack.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.333
Someone set a trap.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.291
- For her?
- No, for me.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.208
Someone wanted to hurt me...

16:58.000 --> 16:59.291
so they hurt her.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.083
Oh.

17:03.708 --> 17:08.666
So, you're the reason I'm taking
my daughter back home in a box.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.416
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect her, Elizabeth.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.541
You're Nick Fury.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.625
Maria believed in you.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.916
She would've followed you
to the gates of hell and back.

17:27.791 --> 17:34.000
Look, I don't know
what Maria died for out there.

17:34.666 --> 17:38.708
But whatever it was,
don't let it be for nothing.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.958
<i>Developing Story at this hour.</i>

17:49.958 --> 17:53.625
<i>Several bombs exploded today
at an annual celebration in Moscow,</i>

17:53.625 --> 17:55.875
<i>killing at least 2,000 civilians.</i>

17:55.875 --> 17:58.000
<i>One suspect is currently in custody,</i>

17:58.000 --> 18:01.041
<i>identified as a leading member
of the online fringe group,</i>

18:01.041 --> 18:02.875
<i>Americans Against Russia.</i>

18:02.875 --> 18:06.208
<i>The UK Prime Minister
was quick to denounce the attack,</i>

18:06.208 --> 18:08.333
<i>while the NATO Secretary-General says...</i>

18:11.750 --> 18:15.833
<i>Despite the outpouring of condemnation,
all signs point towards</i>

18:15.833 --> 18:17.750
<i>imminent retaliation from Russia</i>

18:17.750 --> 18:19.208
<i>for what the Kremlin regards</i>

18:19.208 --> 18:23.250
<i>as an all-out declaration of war
by the Americans.</i>

18:23.250 --> 18:26.541
<i>They're all saying
we had something to do with Moscow.</i>

18:26.541 --> 18:27.958
<i>Well, I call bull on that.</i>

18:27.958 --> 18:32.333
<i>There's no way that Moscow attack
was committed by Americans.</i>

18:32.333 --> 18:35.125
<i>This has got false flag
written all over it.</i>

18:49.000 --> 18:50.916
How did you know Fury would be there?

18:52.166 --> 18:53.166
I didn't.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.500
Well, not to a certainty. But I hoped.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.375
I wanted to see how much of him was left.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.333
And?

19:09.666 --> 19:13.333
He's just vapors. Old.

19:14.958 --> 19:17.291
You know,
I could've killed him if I wanted to.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.916
You don't punish a man
by givin' him what he wants.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.750
You just get me to the Council meeting.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.833
I wanna see their faces
while Moscow is still burnin'.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.333
You, wait.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.958
Uh, yeah, that's not happening.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.041
Gravik.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.416
If I'm not out in an hour,

20:11.625 --> 20:12.833
shoot him in the head.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.458
Members of the Council.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.958
Seems someone didn't get
the suggested attire memo.

20:31.666 --> 20:35.375
Well, I also didn't get a formal
invitation, Mr. Secretary-General.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.583
But I'm sure
that was just a curious oversight.

20:40.583 --> 20:41.750
Madam Prime Minister.

20:44.666 --> 20:45.666
Hello, Shirley.

20:47.208 --> 20:51.583
I trust I speak for the group when I say,
we are all happy to have you with us.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.666
Please sit.

21:02.583 --> 21:03.916
I see you,

21:03.916 --> 21:08.500
all dressed up in the man's finery,
drinking the man's wine.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.250
Playing the man's game,
using the man's fork and knife.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.041
Better to behave as a human than as a dog.

21:17.166 --> 21:18.375
Well, I quite like dogs.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.583
In fact, I prefer 'em.

21:22.541 --> 21:25.791
Dogs aren't hypocrites.
And they don't lie.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.458
They don't lock each other up in cages.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.708
They don't pimp, poison,

21:32.625 --> 21:36.500
and they don't go out of their way
to degrade and destroy their own habitat.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.041
A naive reading of human history.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.250
It's the only reading of human history.

21:44.708 --> 21:45.875
Are you done?

21:46.875 --> 21:49.416
Perhaps we should get on
with what we came here for.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.541
A prudent suggestion, sister.

21:52.500 --> 21:56.458
Recent acts of terror
in cities across the globe,

21:56.458 --> 21:59.125
most notably in Moscow,

21:59.125 --> 22:03.583
severely undermine the stability
that this Council seeks to preserve.

22:04.625 --> 22:08.833
The purpose of tonight
is to determine what punishment, if any,

22:08.833 --> 22:12.916
should be meted out on the individual
who has imperiled us all.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.375
You murdered over 2,000 innocent humans.

22:16.958 --> 22:17.958
Children.

22:17.958 --> 22:20.625
And yet,
you don't seem remotely remorseful.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.625
What the hell gives you the right
to disobey this council?

22:25.916 --> 22:27.333
What gives me the right?

23:14.250 --> 23:15.875
I think it's a war.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.291
I think it's a war!

23:18.916 --> 23:19.916
Hmm?

23:19.916 --> 23:23.541
And unlike the last war each one of us
around this table fought in,

23:23.541 --> 23:25.041
I'm not gonna lose this one.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.791
Humans are doomed to self-destruction.

23:27.791 --> 23:31.625
Long before we arrived on this planet,
they were destined to consume themselves.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.791
So, for anyone flinching
at the thought of innocent deaths,

23:34.791 --> 23:40.083
let me assure you,
we're only hastening the inevitable.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.750
And what happens
if the Avengers return?

23:44.958 --> 23:46.625
You don't think I thought about that?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.125
Put your faith in me.

23:49.916 --> 23:53.583
And I promise,
your loyalty will be repaid.

23:57.541 --> 23:59.916
Well, Madam Prime Minister...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.916
We need to streamline
our chain of command.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.708
Democracy is fine for peacetime,
but whilst at war,

24:12.708 --> 24:16.458
we need a single commander
whose war power is total and unchecked.

24:16.458 --> 24:17.708
My God!

24:17.708 --> 24:22.583
Therefore, I nominate Gravik
to the post of Skrull General.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.666
Traitor!

24:23.666 --> 24:25.791
You were in on this with him
the entire time!

24:25.791 --> 24:27.750
Seat yourself down, Sergio.
I'm not done yet.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.583
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm the commander of NATO.

24:30.583 --> 24:33.958
I can mobilize a million troops
at the snap of a...

24:35.458 --> 24:36.875
Shall I remove him, Madame?

24:37.500 --> 24:39.666
Oh, I don't think
he'll be any more trouble.

24:44.833 --> 24:48.416
All those in favor of Gravik
as our new general...

24:50.541 --> 24:51.541
will submit.

25:17.291 --> 25:21.250
I fear each one of you
has forgotten our history.

25:22.041 --> 25:26.666
We did not end up homeless refugees
because we were unwilling to wage war.

25:27.375 --> 25:31.291
We ended up homeless refugees
because we were too willing.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.250
I do not support your coup.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.875
I will not support your war.

25:40.208 --> 25:42.000
And I do not submit.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.791
If I had another 100 like you,
I could take on the universe.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.666
You go in peace, sister.
You'll not be harmed.

26:35.666 --> 26:37.708
- Shirley.
<i>- It's Gravik.</i>

26:37.708 --> 26:40.208
The Council just voted him General.

26:40.208 --> 26:43.291
He has control of our people
and our future.

26:43.291 --> 26:44.833
If there's anything I can do...

26:44.833 --> 26:48.916
Yeah, set up a meet
between me and Gravik. Public place.

26:48.916 --> 26:50.500
<i>Talos, he will kill you.</i>

26:50.500 --> 26:52.291
Yeah, thanks for the faith.

26:52.291 --> 26:55.083
<i>You don't understand.
Gravik has changed.</i>

26:55.083 --> 26:57.458
So have I. Soren's dead.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.291
<i>I know.</i>

26:59.291 --> 27:02.208
<i>But if you can't keep it together,
you will not walk out alive.</i>

27:02.208 --> 27:04.458
Shirley, set up the meet.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.958
Just tell him
I wanna talk about my daughter.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.333
Thank you, sir.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.833
Without you, this wouldn't be possible.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.708
You don't have it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.125
Harvest wasn't there.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.875
Then it's back to scavenging.

29:18.666 --> 29:21.250
Our DNA selection
remains extremely limited.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.958
I'll send out teams.

29:22.958 --> 29:25.458
I was told this phase
would be over.

29:26.458 --> 29:27.583
So was I.

29:28.958 --> 29:32.958
Gravik has given me multiple locations
for the Harvest, all of them empty.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.458
Our fearless leader isn't always right.

29:36.833 --> 29:38.375
Perhaps I misheard you.

29:38.375 --> 29:41.208
Do you need anything else, Dr. Dalton?

29:41.208 --> 29:43.625
Yes. Your absence.

30:06.875 --> 30:10.625
In this stunning sign
of just how seriously it regards rumors

30:10.625 --> 30:13.041
of American involvement
in the Moscow attacks,

30:13.041 --> 30:16.541
the 27 EU heads of state,
plus the British Prime Minster

30:16.541 --> 30:19.416
have all but commanded Washington
to account for itself

30:19.416 --> 30:22.791
at this emergency security summit
here in London.

30:24.333 --> 30:25.333
Colonel?

30:27.958 --> 30:29.041
Colonel Rhodes?

30:31.041 --> 30:34.291
Colonel, are you denying
that two of your citizens,

30:34.291 --> 30:37.708
Mr. Nicholas Fury and Miss Maria Hill,

30:37.708 --> 30:41.375
were present in Moscow
at the scene of the attacks?

30:42.416 --> 30:46.708
We are aware of allegations
that Mr. Fury and Miss Hill

30:46.708 --> 30:48.083
may have traveled to Moscow.

30:48.083 --> 30:51.666
Which, if true, it would've been in
their capacity as private citizens, so...

30:52.291 --> 30:56.958
Do these photos suffice as confirmation
of that fact, Colonel Rhodes?

30:58.333 --> 30:59.875
Respectfully, Prime Minister,

30:59.875 --> 31:03.541
I can't take the authenticity
of Russian-supplied photos at face value.

31:03.541 --> 31:05.583
However, I will be more than happy

31:05.583 --> 31:08.041
to have them analyzed
at our facilities at Langley.

31:11.791 --> 31:15.333
How do you explain
Mr. Fury's presence in Moscow?

31:15.333 --> 31:18.791
Uh, alleged. Alleged presence, madam.

31:21.208 --> 31:23.250
If Slovakia rolls its eyes at me
one more time,

31:23.250 --> 31:25.541
I'm gonna put on the suit
and carpet bomb it.

31:25.541 --> 31:27.333
Why are you here, Colonel?

31:27.333 --> 31:29.083
You are not a Head of State.

31:30.208 --> 31:33.958
Surely, President Ritson
is aware of the seriousness

31:33.958 --> 31:37.250
with which his international partners
regard this allegation.

31:40.291 --> 31:43.666
Well, I'm here as a courtesy,
Madam Prime Minister.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.791
President Ritson has a pretty busy day job

31:45.791 --> 31:49.166
running the most powerful country
and military on the face of the planet.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.875
He doesn't just hop to when summoned.

31:50.875 --> 31:54.250
Not by France,
not by Italy, not by the UK.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.958
Now, while we are sensitive
to your concerns,

31:57.958 --> 32:01.291
until such time as you can present
an actual shred of evidence

32:01.291 --> 32:03.250
to back those concerns up,

32:03.250 --> 32:06.208
I'm afraid sensitivity
is all you're gonna be getting from us.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.083
All right?

32:18.583 --> 32:21.208
Rhodes.
<i>Nice suit. Armani?</i>

32:22.333 --> 32:23.875
Brioni.

32:23.875 --> 32:24.958
Fury.

32:24.958 --> 32:27.250
<i>Pretty expensive for a government salary.</i>

32:27.250 --> 32:29.708
Yeah, well,
my other suit's made of titanium

32:29.708 --> 32:32.250
so this actually constitutes
considerable savings.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.208
<i>We need to meet. ASAP.</i>

32:34.208 --> 32:36.791
Great. Tell you what,
let me just finish mopping up

32:36.791 --> 32:40.250
this globe-sized bucket of steaming hot
kaka you tipped over yesterday

32:40.250 --> 32:42.250
and then, we can get a drink. Sound good?

32:42.250 --> 32:46.291
<i>You sound frustrated.
What's the matter? Croatia talking crap?</i>

32:46.291 --> 32:47.458
Slovakia.

32:48.041 --> 32:49.583
<i>Well, carpet-bomb their ass.</i>

32:50.375 --> 32:52.541
Burner's Tavern, one o'clock.

32:52.541 --> 32:56.500
Do me a favor and try not to pop off
a nuclear holocaust before you get there.

33:27.291 --> 33:29.208
Should I be worried about poison?

33:29.875 --> 33:32.416
You should be worried
about spending the rest of your days

33:32.416 --> 33:34.375
in the Siberian retirement community.

33:34.375 --> 33:36.958
Yeah, don't let the relaxed ambiance
fool you.

33:37.541 --> 33:39.833
I'm this close to handing your ass
over to the Russians.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.958
Forgetting your rank here, Colonel Rhodes?

33:41.958 --> 33:44.458
You do not wanna be playing
"mine is bigger than yours"

33:44.458 --> 33:46.291
with job titles right now, Fury.

33:46.291 --> 33:49.125
Trust me, I'm the last friend you've got.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.166
Are the Russians
really tryin' to pin this on me?

33:51.166 --> 33:53.416
Your face is all over CCTV footage.

33:53.416 --> 33:56.000
I was there trying to stop the attack.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.041
Oh, well, excellent job at that,
by the way. 2,000 dead so far.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.750
Number will probably triple
once they clear all the rubble.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.458
Meaning you not only set the stage
for World War III,

34:05.458 --> 34:08.791
but you simultaneously flipped
all of our allies to Team Russia.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.500
How well do you know your security detail?

34:22.500 --> 34:25.208
I know they're catching bullets first
if I get shot at.

34:25.208 --> 34:28.291
What do you mean
how much do I know about 'em?

34:28.291 --> 34:31.416
What if I told you they were all spies?

34:32.583 --> 34:34.125
Spies for who, the Russians?

34:34.916 --> 34:37.666
Well... non-state actors.

34:37.666 --> 34:41.041
You know, global reach,
borderless operations.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.083
- HYDRA?
- Yeah.

34:44.083 --> 34:48.916
If HYDRA was a bunch of green guys
who could shape-shift into your daddy.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.416
So, how long have you known about them?

35:02.541 --> 35:03.708
About 15 years ago,

35:03.708 --> 35:07.708
I was part of an eyes-only,
top-secret presentation.

35:07.708 --> 35:10.375
It was about
a shape-shifting alien species

35:10.375 --> 35:13.250
that had sent a few of its light ships
crashing down to Earth.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.500
The Pentagon was concerned

35:15.500 --> 35:19.583
that they might get into their heads
to invade us one day from the inside.

35:20.250 --> 35:23.541
That invasion is real. It's happened.

35:24.291 --> 35:26.541
That's... That's not possible.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.833
Yeah, that's what I thought, too,
but it's true.

35:28.833 --> 35:30.625
And here's the crazy part,

35:30.625 --> 35:34.541
we're being invaded and we can't even tell
who the invaders are.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.625
Moscow was just the beginning.

35:38.416 --> 35:39.875
Maybe we should call our friends.

35:39.875 --> 35:42.458
No, no, no, we can't jump the gun on that.

35:42.458 --> 35:45.083
You know, we get them
in a fight with the Skrulls

35:45.083 --> 35:46.416
and next thing you know,

35:46.416 --> 35:49.666
they find themselves duplicated
and turned into terrorists.

35:49.666 --> 35:50.875
Fury, this isn't...

35:50.875 --> 35:53.291
This is my war, Rhodey.

35:53.291 --> 35:55.166
I need you to back me on this.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.333
I... I can't do it.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.833
Ain't no "can't" in our business.

35:58.833 --> 36:01.666
There's only what you can do
and what you will not do.

36:01.666 --> 36:04.500
You're right.
I should've said, I'm not doing it.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.583
I just spent
all the political capital I had

36:06.583 --> 36:08.916
in getting Maria Hill's body
back from the Russians.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.916
Are you really talking to me
about politics right now?

36:10.916 --> 36:14.166
I'm here as an envoy
of the United States government, Fury.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.375
The job is political.

36:15.375 --> 36:17.958
I remember when your job
was protecting the planet.

36:17.958 --> 36:21.208
We protect the planet
by protecting our seat at the table.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.833
Are you forgetting who helped you
get your seat at the table?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.791
Oh, so I owe you now? Is that it?

36:25.791 --> 36:28.000
We owe each other.

36:28.791 --> 36:32.458
Men who look like us don't get promoted
because of who our daddies know.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.291
Every ounce of power
we wrestle from the vice grip

36:35.291 --> 36:41.083
of the mediocre Alexander Pierces
who run this world was earned in blood.

36:41.083 --> 36:44.541
So let's make the power mean something.
Help a brother out.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.916
Car's outside, Colonel.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.583
Colonel Rhodes will let you know
when he's ready to go.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.166
The car is for you, Fury.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.041
They'll escort you outside,
then you're goin' to the airport.

36:55.041 --> 36:58.375
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't know I had travel plans.

36:59.041 --> 37:00.583
I made 'em on your behalf.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.916
Have you even listened
to a word that I've said?

37:02.916 --> 37:06.333
Yeah, I have. The world is on the line.

37:06.333 --> 37:09.125
The enemy is a million times
more dangerous than HYDRA,

37:09.125 --> 37:11.083
but they can only be vanquished by you.

37:11.083 --> 37:12.166
Alone.

37:12.166 --> 37:15.583
And you want me to make the power
mean something by helpin' a brother out.

37:15.583 --> 37:17.166
But you should know better than most.

37:17.166 --> 37:21.916
The reason we wrestled this power
from mediocre men who don't look like us

37:21.916 --> 37:25.208
was not simply to turn around
and hand it to mediocre men who do.

37:25.208 --> 37:28.500
The point of this power
is to be uncompromising,

37:28.500 --> 37:30.250
to be unsparing,

37:30.250 --> 37:33.541
to be able to sit across
from a man we greatly admire,

37:34.125 --> 37:38.833
with whom we share an entire professional,
personal, ancestral history with

37:38.833 --> 37:42.291
and to tell him without any reservation,
that he's fired.

37:43.583 --> 37:47.125
That's what this moment right here,
right now is about, Nick.

37:56.750 --> 37:59.833
They sent you to fire me?

37:59.833 --> 38:03.083
Nobody sent me. I volunteered.

38:03.083 --> 38:07.166
And not to put too fine a point on this,
but that mess that you created in Moscow

38:07.166 --> 38:09.958
that resulted in getting
one of our best people murdered,

38:09.958 --> 38:12.250
you earned all this smoke, brother.

38:19.541 --> 38:20.583
Move.

38:20.583 --> 38:23.708
Are you seriously under the impression

38:23.708 --> 38:28.041
that just because you strip me
of my titles, I relinquish my DNA?

38:28.041 --> 38:29.125
Careful, Fury.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.916
And you wonder why you're out.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.083
I'm Nick Fury.

38:44.541 --> 38:47.708
Even when I'm out, I'm in.

39:21.958 --> 39:23.958
Yes,
and now that the door is unlocked,

39:23.958 --> 39:25.833
what does that tell you
about me and doors?

39:27.208 --> 39:28.375
Who are you?

39:28.375 --> 39:30.416
I'm above your pay grade. Where is he?

39:33.041 --> 39:34.125
Thank you.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.500
Where is your safe house?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.416
Speak!
Didn't your mother ever warn you

39:58.416 --> 40:01.208
you could lose an eye
by beating your meat like that?

40:03.416 --> 40:05.000
What are you doing here?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.625
Oh, I'm taking over.

40:33.833 --> 40:37.750
I've thrown everything at him
and he hasn't said a word.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.208
What makes you think
you can get him to speak?

40:40.208 --> 40:41.875
Oh, I can be quite persuasive.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.291
Oh, before I forget,
where is the escape hatch in this dump?

40:45.291 --> 40:46.666
Why do you need to know that?

40:46.666 --> 40:47.750
Oh, just a hunch.

40:50.833 --> 40:53.416
Oh, wonderful. Okay, make yourself scarce.

41:08.791 --> 41:10.250
What are you looking at?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.666
Alone at last. Now, shall we do this
the easy way or the other way?

41:17.333 --> 41:18.958
I'm gonna break these chains.

41:18.958 --> 41:21.916
And then, I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

41:21.916 --> 41:24.041
The other way it is.

41:33.833 --> 41:34.833
Mmm.

41:34.833 --> 41:38.791
Well, now that's confirmed,
let's party, shall we?

42:03.458 --> 42:04.958
What are you doing in here?

42:07.041 --> 42:09.250
Checking the progress
of our newest recruit.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.833
He'll be ready for a face before long.

42:18.083 --> 42:19.250
He's loyal.

42:20.125 --> 42:21.125
Loyal.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.875
You know, I remember
when you first came to me, G'iah.

42:27.375 --> 42:29.208
The daughter of a failed General.

42:30.166 --> 42:34.583
I thought to myself, what kind of coward
sends his daughter to do what he wouldn't?

42:34.583 --> 42:39.458
But you know, then I realized that kind of
coward just doesn't have it in him.

42:47.875 --> 42:50.333
Our man on the inside located Brogan.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.333
Let's go then.

42:56.083 --> 42:59.083
You're wasting your time.
I'll never talk to you.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.458
Well, that's very brave,

43:00.458 --> 43:04.250
but everyone talks
when their blood starts to cook at 160°C.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.958
It's a biochemical imperative.

43:05.958 --> 43:08.666
The smart ones
start talking earlier than that.

43:08.666 --> 43:10.083
You a smart one?

43:11.250 --> 43:12.750
Right, I didn't think so.

43:13.666 --> 43:16.375
Go ahead, put it in my arm. I don't care.

43:59.958 --> 44:02.291
Tell me the location
of Gravik's compound.

44:02.291 --> 44:05.291
I swear I know nothing. Please!

44:05.291 --> 44:08.000
I'm afraid, sorry, dear heart,
I can't work with nothing.

44:09.250 --> 44:12.500
I need to know where Gravik is,
and where he'll be.

44:12.500 --> 44:15.916
I don't know, I swear.
Gravik keeps everything a secret.

44:16.583 --> 44:18.166
And what secrets doesn't he keep?

44:21.250 --> 44:22.541
He's building a machine.

44:22.541 --> 44:23.833
What kind of machine?

44:25.833 --> 44:27.500
I think it's to make us stronger.

44:35.041 --> 44:36.125
You wait in the car.

44:36.125 --> 44:37.750
- Keep the engine running.
- Mmm-hmm.

44:41.708 --> 44:42.791
Who's helping you?

44:45.083 --> 44:46.250
I don't know what you mean.

44:46.250 --> 44:48.125
Who's leading the science?

44:53.375 --> 44:54.708
Some married couple.

44:55.833 --> 44:56.833
What's their name?

44:59.500 --> 45:02.291
I can't, please. Gravik will kill me.

45:03.541 --> 45:05.583
I'm terribly sorry,
but if I don't get a name,

45:05.583 --> 45:07.958
Gravik won't get the chance to kill you.

45:11.750 --> 45:12.750
Please.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
Dalton.

45:17.416 --> 45:18.541
The name's Dalton.

45:20.583 --> 45:22.833
You see,
that wasn't so terribly difficult, was it?

46:16.458 --> 46:17.750
Sounds like your lift is here.

46:22.125 --> 46:24.416
Listen, I'm just gonna go
and check around back.

46:25.375 --> 46:26.375
Cool. I'll come with.

46:26.375 --> 46:29.041
No, no, no. You stay here.
They might come out with Brogan.

46:30.083 --> 46:31.125
Yeah.

46:31.125 --> 46:32.416
You're a smart lady, G'iah.

46:59.875 --> 47:01.750
How very Dostoyevsky.

47:40.375 --> 47:41.375
Gotcha.

47:43.375 --> 47:44.583
You're all right.

47:44.583 --> 47:46.708
I've got him. Let's go.

47:53.833 --> 47:55.000
What'd you tell 'em?

47:56.291 --> 47:57.625
Nothin', just lies.

47:59.250 --> 48:00.250
Nothin'?

48:01.333 --> 48:02.750
Just lies?

48:02.750 --> 48:04.083
That's all, I swear.

48:15.208 --> 48:16.375
Take him to the car.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.000
Keep driving.

48:44.166 --> 48:46.208
How did they find our safe house?

49:09.958 --> 49:10.958
Pull over.

49:36.416 --> 49:37.958
Did we make it home, Pagon?

49:39.916 --> 49:41.125
Almost there, bro.

52:10.166 --> 52:11.833
Aren't you forgetting something?

52:30.041 --> 52:31.041
Better?

52:34.291 --> 52:35.500
Almost.

52:44.208 --> 52:49.666
<i>All you got to do is, man,
hold her when you wanna</i>

52:49.666 --> 52:54.333
<i>Squeeze her, don't tease her,
never leave her</i>

52:55.166 --> 53:01.333
<i>Get to her, got, got, got to try
a little tenderness, yeah, yeah</i>

53:01.541 --> 53:04.500
<i>You got to know how to love her, man</i>

53:04.500 --> 53:07.083
<i>Don't be surprised, man</i>

53:07.083 --> 53:11.500
<i>You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her, never leave</i>

53:11.500 --> 53:15.750
<i>You got to hold her,
brother, something, man</i>

53:15.750 --> 53:19.125
<i>Try a little tenderness
yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

53:19.458 --> 53:22.291
<i>You got to grab her gently, man</i>

53:24.458 --> 53:26.083
<i>Don't bruise her, no, no</i>

53:26.083 --> 53:30.333
<i>You got to love her, tease her,
don't squeeze her</i>

53:30.333 --> 53:32.791
<i>You got to try, na na na na na</i>

53:32.791 --> 53:36.666
<i>Try, try a little tenderness, yeah</i>

53:36.666 --> 53:37.750
<i>Watch her groove</i>

53:38.291 --> 53:41.291
<i>You got to know what to do, man</i>

53:41.291 --> 53:42.708
<i>Take this advice</i>

53:42.708 --> 53:46.750
<i>You gotta love, squeeze, don't tease</i>
