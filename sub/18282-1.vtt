00:18.019 --> 00:19.385
Isobel?

00:19.453 --> 00:22.921
The ornaments are only
for looking, remember?

00:22.990 --> 00:24.523
Those are very expensive.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.159
When I grow up can I have
a real tree?

00:27.228 --> 00:28.794
Why would you want that?

00:28.863 --> 00:30.629
This one will be yours
one day.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.298
Besides, real trees dry out,
sweetie.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.935
This way everything stays
neat and clean.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.076
There we go. That's better.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.544
Can I make a gingerbread house?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.646
You know I just cleaned
the kitchen.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.948
But we can get one from
the bakery if you'd like.

00:50.017 --> 00:54.653
Just play quietly and don't
get your colours on the carpet.

00:56.957 --> 01:00.292
Someday I'm gonna have
my own Christmas,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.529
with gingerbread and decorations
I can touch.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.431
And a lot of other stuff.

01:05.498 --> 01:06.932
Help me think, Buddy.

01:07.001 --> 01:10.436
Ice skating, sing caroling,

01:10.504 --> 01:13.672
a picture with Santa,

01:13.741 --> 01:16.141
and a real tree.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.899
Perfect as ever, Isobel.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.735
It just wouldn't be Christmas
without that tree.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.871
Aren't family traditions
just wonderful?

01:45.940 --> 01:48.073
Thank you for agreeing
to house sit, mom.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.275
With all those painters
running around my place,

01:50.344 --> 01:53.979
I needed somewhere to escape.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.116
And I'll find plenty
to do around here.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.788
That could use a little water,
dear.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.958
Hey, is that what I think it is?

02:06.026 --> 02:08.327
I found it in your old
bedroom closet.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.162
Thought you might like
to have it.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.397
Oh.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.036
( Gasps )

02:17.071 --> 02:20.239
It's my old treasure box!

02:22.743 --> 02:25.911
My doll.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.379
My old building blocks?

02:27.448 --> 02:30.482
Wow, I haven't thought
about these things in years.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.995
You know, these big ones
really should be

02:32.019 --> 02:35.687
on the bottom branches, right?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.100
<i>Have you decided where
you and your new boyfriend</i>

02:37.124 --> 02:38.490
are going, by the way?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.892
No, not yet.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.195
Brett left it up to me but
I know he'd prefer Hawaii.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.997
And how are you two doing?

02:45.065 --> 02:46.465
Is this serious?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.599
It's fun.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.101
Too soon to tell.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.881
I think we're both thinking
this will be a good opportunity

02:50.905 --> 02:55.073
for us to get to know
one another better.

02:55.142 --> 02:58.043
Oh, it's my old Christmas list!

02:58.112 --> 03:03.582
Ice skate, sing carols,
picture with Santa...

03:03.651 --> 03:06.652
where did I think of
all these things?

03:06.720 --> 03:11.290
All those old holiday movies you
used to love so much I guess.

03:11.358 --> 03:15.060
Everything I thought
Christmas should be.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.461
Huh.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.468
What? What're you doing?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.939
Maybe we won't go to Hawaii
this year after all.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.842
Perfect Christmas town?

03:30.911 --> 03:33.979
Perfect Christmas town.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.089
Oh, wow.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.835
That's everything
I always thought Christmas

03:45.859 --> 03:48.927
should look like.

03:48.996 --> 03:53.098
Snow.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.435
I always wanted snow.

04:00.274 --> 04:05.043
Pine trees! Icicles! Snow!

04:05.112 --> 04:09.081
( laughing )

04:21.695 --> 04:22.961
( laughs )

04:23.030 --> 04:24.841
Yeah, that's what I get
for spending my entire life

04:24.865 --> 04:26.531
in San Diego, right?

04:26.600 --> 04:30.035
85 degrees in December,
how is that normal?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.603
( laughs )

04:31.672 --> 04:33.705
Let's hear it for Isobel Grey,
everyone.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.707
Our award-winning VP of design

04:35.776 --> 04:38.577
and the one to thank
for today's celebration.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.945
To Isobel.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.246
( Crowd )
Isobel.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.549
Aw, well, I hope you all
are having a great time

04:44.618 --> 04:46.585
and you know how much I love
to organize.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.820
Mr. Bishop? A Mr. Hernandez?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.656
Oh, uh, put that through
to my office.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.524
I- I'm sorry everyone,
I have to take this

04:52.593 --> 04:56.795
but here's to you all with
thanks for a great year gone by

04:56.864 --> 04:58.630
and an even better year ahead.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.699
Merry Christmas.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.866
( All ): Merry Christmas!

05:00.934 --> 05:02.901
Oh! Goodness!

05:02.970 --> 05:04.336
I am so, so sorry!

05:04.405 --> 05:06.104
Oh, don't even worry about it.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.875
It's a fashion house so luckily
we have options.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.310
Hey, everyone!

05:11.378 --> 05:13.211
There is cake.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.781
I didn't make it so...

05:15.849 --> 05:17.215
( crowd laughing )

05:17.284 --> 05:19.051
You all are safe.

05:24.925 --> 05:25.590
( Knocking )

05:25.659 --> 05:26.792
Come in.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
Sorry I had to duck out.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.029
Is everything alright?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.564
Oh, it is now.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.966
I'm all done with work
and now I get to spend

05:35.035 --> 05:39.471
seven whole days alone with
this new guy I've been seeing.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.207
New guy? Ugh, I don't like
the sound of that.

05:42.276 --> 05:43.442
Anyone I know?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.743
Brett Bishop?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.144
Maybe you've heard of him?

05:46.213 --> 05:47.379
He owns the company?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.580
Brett Bishop...

05:48.649 --> 05:50.449
Brett Bishop Design?
That Brett Bishop?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.383
Yeah.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.418
Lucky guy.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.958
So, I know we talked about
going somewhere hot,

06:00.027 --> 06:01.560
somewhere beachy...

06:01.628 --> 06:03.261
Mmmhmm, right.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.298
But I made us reservations
in the most perfect

06:06.367 --> 06:08.700
Christmas town ever.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.447
Why do I have a feeling
we have different ideas

06:10.471 --> 06:12.437
about what that is.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.173
Snow, roaring fireplaces,
sweaters.

06:15.242 --> 06:18.543
Oh, and to make sure we don't
forget about a thing,

06:18.612 --> 06:19.778
I made a bucket list.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.413
A bucket list. Are you alright?

06:21.482 --> 06:22.759
'Cause, you know, usually
you make a bucket list

06:22.783 --> 06:24.082
if you're about to...

06:24.151 --> 06:26.785
Not that kind of bucket list,
a Christmas bucket list.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.431
A list of things you wanna
make sure you do

06:28.455 --> 06:31.523
before the holidays are gone.
Not me.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.225
See?

06:33.293 --> 06:34.893
I started it when I was a kid.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.261
I just updated it.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.463
They're all the things I missed
out on growing up.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.032
A real tree, caroling,
ice skating.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.434
These all sound very cold.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.872
What about palm trees
or Santa on a surf board?

06:46.940 --> 06:49.975
Oh, we have so much to learn
about each other.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.777
Please tell me you love it.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.781
I just so want a real Christmas
this year.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.451
What's uh...
what's this last one?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.420
A secret wish?

07:01.488 --> 07:02.888
Oh, well that one's new

07:02.956 --> 07:06.191
but I promise you it's worth
your time to find out.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.226
Really?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.928
What do you think?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.763
This is... this is great.

07:11.832 --> 07:15.066
It's amazing, but...
I've got some bad news.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.102
I mean, not-not bad news...

07:17.171 --> 07:18.703
ok, yeah, no it's-it's bad.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.805
Our factory down in Rio,

07:19.873 --> 07:21.050
they got a real mess
on their hands

07:21.074 --> 07:22.307
and I have
to fly down there.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.410
South America? When?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.545
Oh no.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.979
If there was a way around
it...

07:28.048 --> 07:31.716
But... but our flights are
first thing in the morning.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.452
You go without me.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.597
I'll meet you there
in a few days.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.021
Christmas at the latest.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.756
But that's days away.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.960
I will make this up to you.
I promise. Ok?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.229
I gotta run.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.164
I'll call you.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.472
Yes. You're perfect.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.373
Look at you.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.209
You even smell like Christmas.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.512
Oh, how would you like
to come home with me?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.517
Woah. Uh, hi there.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.685
This one's taken for.

11:26.753 --> 11:27.797
Looks like we have
a problem.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.287
No, not really because

11:29.356 --> 11:30.636
( simultaneous ) I saw it first.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.490
Oh, uh...

11:32.559 --> 11:34.693
Ok. Maybe you saw that side of
it first, but...

11:34.761 --> 11:35.593
This side, that side,

11:35.662 --> 11:36.662
it's all the same tree

11:36.730 --> 11:38.430
so if you wouldn't mind
just letting go.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.898
Alright, well here's the thing.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.944
Kyle here has really got his
heart set on this one, so...

11:41.968 --> 11:42.968
Kyle?

11:44.438 --> 11:48.039
Kyle, and uh, and that's Trish.

11:48.108 --> 11:48.907
Hi.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.175
I'm sorry, you are...?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.243
Oh, Isobel.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.610
Isobel Grey.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.945
Hi Isobel Grey,
Jamie Haughton.

11:54.014 --> 11:54.813
Nice to meet you.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.580
Nice to meet you.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.115
Wanna come to my show?

11:57.184 --> 11:57.849
Oh.

11:57.918 --> 11:58.918
It's a school thing.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.263
Not now, Kyle,
we're negotiating.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.087
Well, no. We're not exactly
negotiating

12:02.155 --> 12:03.688
because there's nothing
to negotiate

12:03.757 --> 12:06.191
because this tree is mine.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.559
Ok. Here's the thing.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.747
I'd be happy to help you
find another tree in the lot-

12:09.796 --> 12:12.397
Oh, no, Jamie...

12:12.466 --> 12:14.043
you don't mind if I call you
Jamie, do you?

12:14.067 --> 12:17.535
You see, this may be a
little bit hard to believe

12:17.604 --> 12:21.573
but I picked out this exact tree
25 years ago.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.774
That's very hard to believe.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.608
I'm not kidding.

12:23.677 --> 12:24.776
This exact tree.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.978
This-this shape and size
and colour.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.257
I've been dreaming
about this tree

12:28.281 --> 12:30.081
since I first knew what
a Christmas tree was.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.783
See, I'm from California...

12:31.852 --> 12:34.753
Oh, Jamie, give her the tree.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.354
Listen to your wife.

the one that I have in my head.

She's got Christmas
in her head?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.462
That's what she says.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.975
The perfect town,
the perfect cottage,

12:45.999 --> 12:52.070
the perfect holiday getaway
for me and my-my boyfriend.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.271
Is he in your head, too?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.607
No, he's coming, later,
eventually,

12:55.675 --> 12:57.175
we think, by Christmas.

12:57.244 --> 12:57.942
Most likely.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.410
He's a very busy man.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.719
Is your boyfriend Santa Clause?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.680
Could we get back
to the tree please?

on something

13:06.153 --> 13:07.452

13:10.257 --> 13:11.422
He found another one.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.324
( laughs )

13:13.393 --> 13:14.626
I'll go.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.361
Let her have the tree.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.929
The place closes
in five minutes.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.063
Thank you.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.132
Ok.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.267

gonna be the price for the tree,

13:37.017 --> 13:39.851

13:39.920 --> 13:41.286
Absolutely.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.453
Sure.

streamlined look.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.673
Well, mission accomplished
there.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.653
You should probably add a bit
more icing to your roof though,

22:24.677 --> 22:25.876
it's gonna fall off.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.378
Who's house is this?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.347
Which one of us owns
a construction company?

( Kids laughing )

22:39.492 --> 22:41.058
How much time do I have?

22:41.127 --> 22:41.926
Not much.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.461
Tick tock.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.030
Wow.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.656
( Bell rings )

23:12.725 --> 23:15.593
Ok, contestants. That's it.

23:15.661 --> 23:19.663
Everybody step back from
your gingerbread houses.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.899
Do you think I have a chance?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.001
If they judge by the pound,
you're golden.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.747
Hey, seventh place.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.416
That's not so bad, right?

23:38.484 --> 23:41.152
No. Considering there were only
seven contestants...

23:41.220 --> 23:43.387
Hey. You're not helping.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.389
Hey, I know something
that'll cheer you up.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.169
It's a place my mom used
to take me when I was a kid.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.193
I don't think I wanna know.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.394
Do you trust me?

23:50.463 --> 23:53.831
At this point, what else
do I have to lose?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.566
That's the spirit.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.840
Wow, this is incredible.

24:02.909 --> 24:03.741
Right?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.776
Where did these come from?

24:05.845 --> 24:12.316
Well, uh, Santa's elves
actually built this as a gift

24:12.385 --> 24:13.851
for the town
over 100 years ago.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.019
( laughs )

24:15.087 --> 24:16.454
I almost believe that.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.922
Yeah, I thought you might.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.202
Tell me, what's the fascination
with the gingerbread houses?

24:20.226 --> 24:23.594
When I was little there was
a bakery in my neighbourhood.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.995
Every year around
the holidays

24:25.064 --> 24:28.899
she had this amazing gingerbread
house in the window

24:28.968 --> 24:30.100
and I'd just walk by it

24:30.169 --> 24:32.503
and imagine the perfect
cookie woman

24:32.572 --> 24:36.707
in her perfect cookie house.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.908
I'm gonna take a wild guess

24:37.977 --> 24:40.544
and say this cookie woman's
name was Isobel.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.713
( laughs )

24:42.782 --> 24:45.282
What gave it away?

24:45.351 --> 24:46.484
Yeah.

24:46.552 --> 24:49.153
And she was a designer
just like me.

24:49.222 --> 24:49.887
Oh, really?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.021
What do you design?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.389
Fashion.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.224
Yeah.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.292
Brett Bishop Designs.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.659
Oh, very cool.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.339
So what you're wearing
right now, did you design that?

24:57.363 --> 24:58.629
Yeah, I did.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.530
I love it.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.465
Thank you so much.
Me too.

25:01.534 --> 25:04.502
The company design is
a little more polished,

25:04.570 --> 25:05.836
more urban.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.039
It's not exactly where my heart
is but boy does it sell.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.441
<i>Right.</i>

25:10.510 --> 25:12.409
Oooh, wow.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.778
<i>Pretty cool, huh?</i>

25:14.847 --> 25:16.480
This is perfect.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.115
<i>( Jamie ): So
gingerbread Isobel...</i>

25:18.184 --> 25:19.049
<i>( Isobel ): Yeah.</i>

25:19.118 --> 25:20.851
<i>( Jamie ): ...she's what?</i>

25:20.920 --> 25:22.052
<i>( Isobel ): Realistic.</i>

25:22.121 --> 25:23.532
Okay. So she doesn't design
what she likes?

25:23.556 --> 25:25.089
She designs what sells.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.190
Ah...

25:26.259 --> 25:28.459
She has her own brand,
her own company.

25:28.528 --> 25:32.029
Something big,
international.

25:32.098 --> 25:37.535
Oh, and that house,
probably in Paris.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.836
Paris?

25:38.905 --> 25:40.938
The property value there is...

25:41.007 --> 25:42.406
the gumdrop sidewalk alone-

25:42.475 --> 25:43.974
She can afford it.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.143
She's wildly successful,
remember?

25:46.212 --> 25:47.545
Very good.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.513
Enough about me,
tell me about you.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.749
If you were a gingerbread man
who would you be?

25:51.817 --> 25:54.084
Oh, my guy? Easy.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.219
Just wants to be happy,

25:55.288 --> 25:57.121
own his own business,
little family,

25:57.189 --> 26:00.858
lots of small town
gingerbread friends.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.660
( laughs )

26:02.728 --> 26:03.861
Alright.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.996
To each his own, I guess.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.498
Hey, listen.

26:07.567 --> 26:12.836
After all that construction
today and this horseback race,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.672
you gotta be building up
an appetite.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.173
Let me buy you lunch.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.877
Oh, you mean like a...
like a date?

26:19.946 --> 26:21.078
No, no.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.958
It'll be more like a consolation
prize, you know?

26:22.982 --> 26:25.583
Plus there's
that old saying:

26:25.651 --> 26:28.118
Man cannot live on
gingerbread alone.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.221
( laughs )

26:31.290 --> 26:32.590
<i>( Isobel ): Giddy up!</i>

26:32.658 --> 26:34.692
Here's your usual.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.094
And one for the lady,
on the house

26:37.163 --> 26:38.896
seeing as it's almost Christmas.

26:38.965 --> 26:39.663
Ohhhh...

26:39.732 --> 26:41.732
What? Thank you, Patty.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.067
Thank you.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.203
Wow, are you supposed to eat
these or climb them?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.105
Cute girl.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.673
Beautiful jacket.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.008
Thank you.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.077
She's talented, too.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.078
She designed that jacket
herself, right?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.914
Well, something like that would
sell like hotcakes up here.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.115
Really?

26:58.184 --> 26:59.661
Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.496
Even the hotcakes don't sell
like hotcakes up here, Patty.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.753
Oh, joke hurts.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.555
( laughing )

27:04.624 --> 27:06.824
But I'm serious about this girl.
Don't mess it up.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.492
Oh, oh, we're not together.

27:08.561 --> 27:09.827
Oh, well, that's a shame.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.428
Water. I'll be right back.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.297
Thank you.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.700
Ok.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.435
Woah, ok.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.536
Let's be honest.

27:19.605 --> 27:22.573
Who has a mouth this big?

27:22.642 --> 27:25.509
Mmm.

27:25.578 --> 27:26.710
Sorry, you were saying?

27:26.779 --> 27:31.048
Never mind.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.383
I have to say,

27:32.451 --> 27:35.185
I still can't believe the mess
I made yesterday.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.854
Being messy is fun sometimes.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.822
Sometimes I guess, but
it's like a road trip.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.557
It's better if you have
a map, right?

27:40.626 --> 27:43.627
Then you miss all the surprises
along the way.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.576
Great job colour coordinating
the sugar packets,

27:45.631 --> 27:47.598
by the way.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.733
Couldn't even look
at them before.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.407
You know what your tree needs?

27:56.475 --> 27:57.641
What?

27:57.710 --> 28:00.210
Lights.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.046
I didn't even think of that.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.516
Perfect.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.218
Are we ready?

28:08.287 --> 28:09.319
I am ready.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.754
Ok.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.160
Here we go.

28:17.797 --> 28:21.065
Ooooh.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.100
Alright.

28:26.572 --> 28:27.705
Alright.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.007
I think that is the most
beautiful Christmas tree

28:30.076 --> 28:32.743
I have ever had.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.111
It's the one in your head.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.412
( laughs )

28:35.481 --> 28:36.580
Exactly.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.082
Alright.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.317
It's making me think of
something I haven't done

28:40.386 --> 28:44.321
since I was a kid, but we used
to do it all the time.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.867
A tree this size...
do you want to try it?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.391
It's a little odd.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.060
Considering the source,
I'm not surprised.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.596
Come on. Here.

28:52.665 --> 28:53.864
Come down here.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.332
What are you doing?

28:55.401 --> 28:56.678
Just... it's not too weird,
I promise.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.635
Just lie down.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.204
Come on.

29:06.645 --> 29:09.480
And this accomplishes what,
exactly?

29:09.548 --> 29:13.684
Just look up.

29:13.753 --> 29:16.887
<i>( Jamie ): That's what a
Christmas sky should look like.</i>

29:16.956 --> 29:20.390
Wow.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.760
<i>Oh, that's spectacular.</i>

29:22.828 --> 29:25.562
<i>( Jamie ): Spectacular.</i>

29:25.631 --> 29:28.265
Thank you, Jamie.

29:30.069 --> 29:34.171
I'm very happy right now.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.775
Very tired.

29:37.843 --> 29:40.744
<i>But very happy.</i>

29:48.854 --> 29:50.854
( door opens )

29:59.064 --> 30:00.697
Isobel?

30:00.766 --> 30:02.533
Mom?!

30:05.037 --> 30:07.004
Well, it's worse than I thought.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.472
You asleep under the tree-

30:08.541 --> 30:09.640
I can explain that.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.308
And now this?

30:11.377 --> 30:12.843
It's a wonder anyone
got out alive.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.045
Mom, seriously.
Why are you here?

30:15.114 --> 30:16.480
You said you needed me.

30:16.549 --> 30:17.447
I didn't.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.849
I listened between the lines.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.185
What lines? There were no lines.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.764
Look. Show me to my room,
we'll get started.

30:22.788 --> 30:23.654
What room?

30:23.722 --> 30:24.988
You don't have a room.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.802
You don't-you're not even
supposed to be here.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.725
This was on the front door.

30:28.794 --> 30:32.296
"I didn't want to wake you"
it says.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.564
Who's Jamie?

30:33.632 --> 30:34.965
Nobody.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.835
Just a somebody who helped me
with the tree lights.

30:37.903 --> 30:41.238
Why did he leave you under the
tree like a Christmas package?

30:41.307 --> 30:42.506
And where is the boyfriend?

30:42.575 --> 30:44.174
The boyfriend is coming.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.042
Hmm.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.376
Mom, seriously, you can't stay.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.412
I'm not kidding.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.724
You know, I didn't bring
the right clothes.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.115
It's much colder here
than I thought.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.085
And have you noticed
it's so small?

30:55.154 --> 30:59.790
The streets, the buildings,
everything is so small.

30:59.859 --> 31:03.160
And... is that a real tree?

31:03.229 --> 31:04.928
Mmmhmm.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.096
Isobel.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.331
And the lights are all wrong.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.632
They're all bunched up.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.133
They look right to me.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.635
Never mind,
we'll fix them later.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.503
So where's my room?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.272
You don't have a room.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.708
Because you don't live here.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.051
So where's Brett?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
Brett who?

31:29.188 --> 31:30.087
( laughs )

31:30.155 --> 31:30.954
I'm just kidding.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.256
Brett's still coming, mom.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.191
He just had a last minute
business trip.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.292
Mmmhmm.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.361
No, seriously.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.028
The company is growing
very fast,

31:38.097 --> 31:39.897
concessions have to be made.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.445
Yes, but it seems like
the only person

31:41.500 --> 31:43.333
making concessions is you.

31:43.402 --> 31:47.571
That's exactly why I need
this time with him... alone.

31:47.640 --> 31:48.705
Time you're not getting.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.240
I'm not kidding.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.310
I have to figure out whether
this is just, you know,

31:53.379 --> 31:57.247
casual dating or something
more serious.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.316
Darling.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.150
Let's go for a sandwich
is casual.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.085
Let's spend a week
in a cabin?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.954
I'm not so sure.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.491
I'm almost afraid to ask...

32:10.596 --> 32:11.428
but what's this?

32:11.497 --> 32:12.763
Where did you find this?

32:12.831 --> 32:15.465
Right out in the open
in your dresser drawer.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.135
A bucket list?

32:18.203 --> 32:19.236
Oh, mom.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.582
It's not that kind of
bucket list.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.183
It's just a list of things
I want to make sure I do

32:22.207 --> 32:26.543
before Christmas ends.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.047
Only Santa takes sleigh rides
these days.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.849
Oh, that tree. What a mess.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.554
And The Nutcracker?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.790
In a town with one stop light?

32:39.858 --> 32:42.759
But mom, these things
are important to me.

32:42.828 --> 32:45.429
The tree, the lights.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.565
And this.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.635
We could have had gingerbread,
any bakery in town.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.438
Well, this one had to be mine.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.506
Your own gingerbread?

32:55.541 --> 32:56.406
Mmmhmm.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.908
Do you hear how that sounds?

32:57.977 --> 33:01.144
You're up here all by yourself,
no friends, nothing to do.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.014
I've got plenty to do.

33:04.083 --> 33:12.083
In fact, how do you feel
about Christmas pageants?

33:12.491 --> 33:13.957
It is so great to meet you,
Ellen.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.227
Unfortunately the timing
is not great.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.462
Right, buddy?

33:18.530 --> 33:19.863
I can't do it.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.566
We will figure something out,
honey.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.736
Kyle was going to play clarinet
while all the ballerinas danced.

33:25.804 --> 33:26.970
I can't do it now.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.139
Why not? Is your clarinet
broken?

33:29.208 --> 33:30.807
Mrs. Meechum's ankle is.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.309
The ballet teacher.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.212
She was going to lead Anna and
the other girls in their dance.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.280
They've been working on it
for weeks.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.915
Maybe I could talk to them?

33:38.984 --> 33:40.817
Sure.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.788
Hey.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.191
Wow, you sure do look pretty
in that dress.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.426
It's a tutu.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.995
Well, it's tutu cute on you.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.463
( laughs )

33:53.532 --> 33:56.867
Hey, I heard that you were maybe
thinking about not dancing.

33:56.935 --> 34:00.003
We can't. Not without
Mrs. Meechum.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.639
You know, I used to take
ballet lessons

34:02.708 --> 34:04.007
when I was just about your age.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.144
She didn't think she was
good enough so she quit.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.179
My daughter's always been hard
on herself.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.714
I don't know where
she gets that.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.516
I'm a sugar plum fairy.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.317
Is that what you were
gonna dance?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.386
The Nutcracker.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.621
The Nutcracker?

34:18.690 --> 34:20.389
Did you hear that?

34:20.458 --> 34:23.293
Is there something special
about The Nutcracker?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.195
I'm not the one to ask.

34:25.264 --> 34:29.199
How would you feel about me
dancing with you?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.467
But you don't know the steps.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.870
Well I know you can show me.

34:33.938 --> 34:40.077
And the rest of it,
we'll just wing it.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.745
Here, let's see if these fit.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.246
It's like it was made for me.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.516
Hey Kyle, warm up
that clarinet

34:47.585 --> 34:51.888
because these birds
are going dancing.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.356
Yes!

34:53.425 --> 35:01.425
( Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy music plays ) ♪♪

35:44.409 --> 35:52.409
( Applause )

35:54.386 --> 35:59.923
( laughing )

35:59.992 --> 36:01.124
Was that ok?

36:01.193 --> 36:02.692
Ok? It was amazing!

36:02.761 --> 36:04.694
Honestly, that was so good!

36:04.763 --> 36:06.563
<i>Oh, darling.</i>

36:08.800 --> 36:11.434
Oh, I loved it so much
seeing you happy like that.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.336
Not even caring if the steps
were right.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.471
They weren't.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.572
I know.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.807
Everybody knew,
but it was wonderful.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.276
Aw, thanks mom.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.245
I may have been wrong
about this place.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.446
It has its charms.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.682
It does, doesn't it?

36:25.751 --> 36:28.218
There's something you don't see
in San Diego I bet.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.386
What're they doing?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.288
School trip up the mountain.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.791
Local tire company supplies
the tubes and they...

36:34.860 --> 36:35.692
it's like sledding.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.060
Huh.

36:37.129 --> 36:39.663
That's sort of like sleighing,
isn't it?

36:39.731 --> 36:40.630
Dear lord.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.798
Mom?

36:41.867 --> 36:42.766
You've lost your mind.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.012
She's lost her mind. Tell her.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.268
Oh, come on.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.481
How many times are we ever
gonna have a chance

36:46.505 --> 36:48.038
to do something like this again?

36:48.106 --> 36:49.372
With any luck, never.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.219
Oh, no. If you want to throw
yourself down a mountain

36:51.243 --> 36:53.310
you're on your own.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.978
Can you tell me how
to get there?

36:55.047 --> 36:58.548
It's a locals only place,
you'd never find it.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.084
But I can take you there.

37:01.153 --> 37:04.020
Oh, well, I couldn't let you
do that.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.289
Let the man take you sleighing
if he wants to.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.290
Sledding?

37:07.359 --> 37:08.458
Tubing.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.159
Whatever.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.994
We're going.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.063
Here are the keys.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.396
Bye. Have fun!

37:13.465 --> 37:15.065
I will.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.785
Are you sure this is
the right place?

37:35.854 --> 37:37.954
I don't see anybody else around.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.557
Let the kids have their
own mountain.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.225
This is my secret spot.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.905
Are you sure you haven't
just brought me out here

37:43.929 --> 37:45.495
to freeze to death?

37:45.564 --> 37:47.330
( laughs )

37:47.399 --> 37:49.499
At Christmastime,
with Santa watching?

37:49.568 --> 37:50.700
Do you think I'm nuts?

37:50.769 --> 37:51.868
Yeah.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.448
So what's the story behind
the sleigh ride?

37:53.472 --> 37:55.071
What makes you think
there's a story?

37:55.140 --> 37:58.141
Because everything you do
has a story behind it.

37:58.210 --> 38:01.177
Have you ever seen the movie
White Christmas?

38:01.246 --> 38:02.579
No, I can't say I have.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.714
You haven't seen
White Christmas?!

38:04.783 --> 38:05.682
Is that the one with the elf?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.484
No, that would be Elf.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.485
Right.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.719
White Christmas is a classic.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.756
It's got Bing Crosby
and Rosemary Clooney,

38:12.824 --> 38:14.858
they sing and dance and fight.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.059
So it's just like us.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.295
Except for the singing
and dancing part.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.964
And then at the end
there's a sleigh ride

38:21.033 --> 38:25.435
and the snow comes falling down
and everybody is so happy.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.471
I want Rosemary Clooney's
happy ending.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.040
Snow and all.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.641
Well, I-granted, at the end

38:31.710 --> 38:34.644
she doesn't go sledding off
on an inner tube.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.147
I tell you, she does not know
what she's missing.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.081
Are you ready?

38:38.150 --> 38:38.948
I'm ready.

38:39.017 --> 38:39.716
Ok.

38:39.785 --> 38:40.550
Grab a tube.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.785
Ok.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.496
Whew!

38:56.468 --> 38:58.535
Wow.

38:58.603 --> 39:03.573
This place is something else.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.975
Something else, huh?

39:06.044 --> 39:09.312
It's really special to you.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.714
Yeah.

39:10.782 --> 39:14.250
I used to come here a lot
with my dad.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.519
He died pretty young and,
you know,

39:16.588 --> 39:20.190
I felt the pressure to step up,
be the man of the house.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.324
How old were you?

39:21.393 --> 39:22.759
Not old enough.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.260
Whenever I wanted time
to myself

39:24.329 --> 39:25.962
to help put things
in perspective

39:26.031 --> 39:29.466
this is where I came.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.000
Ok, about these tubes.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.235
Right. What do we do?

39:32.304 --> 39:33.570
It's super easy.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.239
Throw it down, hop on it,
let gravity do the rest.

39:36.308 --> 39:37.308
Sounds like a plan.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.541
Ok.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.175
But I want to give you
two pointers first.

39:39.244 --> 39:39.676
( Screaming )

39:39.745 --> 39:40.510
Hey!

39:40.579 --> 39:41.678
I said a few pointers!

39:41.747 --> 39:42.779
Help!

39:42.848 --> 39:44.681
( Screaming )

39:44.750 --> 39:46.349
Hold on!

39:46.418 --> 39:48.318
Hold on to what?!

39:48.387 --> 39:49.819
Just hold on!

39:51.189 --> 39:53.923
( laughing )

39:56.261 --> 39:57.360
Are you ok?

39:59.197 --> 40:00.397
( laughing )

40:00.465 --> 40:01.564
Are you ok?

40:01.633 --> 40:02.365
Is anything broken?

40:02.434 --> 40:03.600
Are you alright?

40:03.668 --> 40:05.935
I don't care if I broke
every bone in my body.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.504
I've never been better.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.373
( laughing )

40:10.442 --> 40:11.975
You are nuts.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.410
I know.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.646
That was awesome.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.948
You look...

40:19.017 --> 40:20.784
Yeah?

40:24.856 --> 40:27.056
Wha-wait, wha-

40:27.125 --> 40:28.558
I'm sorry. That's my bad.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.326
You can't just kiss a person
like that.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.060
I know.

40:31.129 --> 40:31.694
I said I was sorry.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.129
You should be.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.697
I'm sorry.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.272
Hey.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.174
Hey, you dropped something.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.475
Give that back to me, please.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.242
What is it?

40:46.311 --> 40:48.144
Christmas Bucket List?

40:48.213 --> 40:49.245
Isobel, are you ok?

40:49.314 --> 40:50.880
It's not that kind of
bucket list.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.982
Why does nobody get that?

40:53.051 --> 40:56.986
Christmas tree, gingerbread
house, The Nutcracker.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.855
Oh, is that what Kyle's concert
was about?

40:58.924 --> 40:59.989
It's personal.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.357
It's alright. I just...

41:01.426 --> 41:02.904
you need a list to get through
Christmas?

41:02.928 --> 41:04.727
Doesn't that take
all the fun out of it?

41:04.796 --> 41:07.330
It's the way my family just
spends the holiday anyway.

41:07.399 --> 41:09.833
Well, I'm very happy for you
and your family.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.913
I'm just saying you don't
need to force it, you know?

41:11.937 --> 41:13.303
Christmas has a life
of its own.

41:13.371 --> 41:14.504
You just let it happen.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.905
Everything will work out.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.541
Christmas has never had a way
of working out for me.

41:18.610 --> 41:22.011
For me it's always been about
sun burns and traffic jams

41:22.080 --> 41:26.616
and overtime and too many
crowds and too much stress.

41:26.685 --> 41:30.520
And for once I would really like
Christmas to just be perfect.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.821
Good enough just won't cut it?

41:31.890 --> 41:34.424
Nothing is ever
just good enough.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.293
I'm so sorry. That must
be exhausting.

41:37.362 --> 41:40.263
Well I'm sorry that my life
offends you.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.831
But this is the way
I've planned it

41:41.900 --> 41:43.233
and this is the way
I'm living it.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.368
No, no, no, no. Isobel.

41:45.437 --> 41:46.437
That's not what I meant.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.171
Take me home!

41:50.942 --> 41:53.610
Oh, how was the sleigh ride?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.078
You're home so soon.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.679
What are you doing?

41:56.748 --> 41:58.982
Well, didn't we agree
the lights are all wrong?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.050
No, we didn't.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.398
They were fine the way
they were.

42:01.453 --> 42:05.054
Well, we both know they weren't,
but now they're perfect.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.656
Isobel, what...

42:13.064 --> 42:13.997
What're you doing?

42:14.065 --> 42:15.065
I'm leaving.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.933
This was a stupid idea.

42:17.002 --> 42:19.035
Call Brett and tell him
not to come.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.471
Instead of having hot cocoa
by a fireplace

42:21.540 --> 42:23.206
we'll have margaritas
on a beach.

42:23.275 --> 42:25.508
That's probably what
he would prefer anyway.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.443
Is this about some silly lights?

42:27.512 --> 42:28.589
I thought I was doing something-

42:28.613 --> 42:30.346
Mom, it's not-
I'm not mad at you.

42:30.415 --> 42:32.315
I'm mad at myself, ok?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.183
I'm mad about the gingerbread
house

42:34.252 --> 42:36.286
and I'm mad about the lights

42:36.354 --> 42:38.421
and the fact that I can't handle
one more day

42:38.490 --> 42:42.792
of my own unrealistic
expectations of myself.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.694
At least let me help you
fold these.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.130
I can't even do that right.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.731
Sweetheart.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.167
You are so hard on yourself.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.613
You've been like that
all your life,

42:52.637 --> 42:54.170
even when you were young.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.350
You wouldn't bring home your
artwork for heaven's sake.

42:56.374 --> 42:59.242
Well, that's because I coloured
outside the lines.

42:59.311 --> 43:00.443
You were five.

43:00.512 --> 43:02.178
Well, Mozart was writing
symphonies

43:02.247 --> 43:04.447
when he was five, right?

43:04.516 --> 43:06.149
What has that got to do
with this?

43:06.217 --> 43:07.595
I'm just saying if he was
writing symphonies

43:07.619 --> 43:10.119
he was probably colouring
inside the lines.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.754
Alright, you stop this.

43:11.823 --> 43:14.524
Stop it right now, because I
won't have you feeling this way.

43:14.593 --> 43:19.696
I just... I just won't.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.497
We need to talk.

43:23.268 --> 43:27.003
Your father and I were never
a good match.

43:27.072 --> 43:31.541
But I tried to make
everything perfect.

43:31.610 --> 43:34.277
Dinner was waiting
and the house was clean

43:34.346 --> 43:35.612
if everything was just so-

43:35.680 --> 43:38.047
That's how I've always felt.

43:38.116 --> 43:42.418
Yes, but the drive for
perfection is mine, not yours.

43:45.290 --> 43:49.826
I've given you such
a terrible gift.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.227
Can you forgive me?

43:51.296 --> 43:53.896
Oh, mom, there's nothing
to forgive.

43:53.965 --> 43:56.833
You alphabetize your
office supplies.

43:56.901 --> 43:59.302
There's nothing wrong
with being organized.

43:59.371 --> 44:02.171
If it doesn't rule your life.

44:02.240 --> 44:06.709
It's taken me all these years
to learn this.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.258
I just want you to know
that the world

44:08.313 --> 44:11.581
isn't gonna come to an end if
the tree lights are all wrong

44:11.650 --> 44:16.119
and if the gingerbread
house topples

44:16.187 --> 44:17.520
and I don't want you
to jeopardize

44:17.589 --> 44:19.122
what you have
with Jamie because of-

44:19.190 --> 44:20.390
Brett.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.858
Whoever.

44:21.926 --> 44:28.698
( laughs )

44:28.767 --> 44:30.466
I do love you, you know.

44:30.535 --> 44:33.102
I love you.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.638
Flaws and all.

44:35.707 --> 44:36.939
I have flaws?

44:37.008 --> 44:38.441
( laughs )

44:38.510 --> 44:39.876
Do you want me
to make a list?

44:39.944 --> 44:43.079
No! No more lists!

44:44.949 --> 44:46.449
Oh, alright.

44:46.518 --> 44:47.550
Come on.

44:47.619 --> 44:49.385
Let's... let's go call
the airport.

44:49.454 --> 44:51.320
No, it's ok. I changed my mind.

44:51.389 --> 44:52.822
I'm gonna stay.

44:52.891 --> 44:54.624
Oh, I'm not talking
about you.

44:54.693 --> 44:58.061
My sister's expecting me for
Christmas dinner, you know.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.407
And you have your
own life to live

44:59.431 --> 45:03.733
and your own holiday to enjoy.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.703
But if you don't mind,

45:06.771 --> 45:09.072
I want to pack my own suitcases.

45:09.140 --> 45:12.208
( laughs )

45:12.277 --> 45:14.210
Deal.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.198
Merry Christmas, captain.

45:35.266 --> 45:36.866
Well, if it isn't the baker.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.267
( Chuckles )

45:38.336 --> 45:40.203
Um, is Jamie around?

45:40.271 --> 45:43.406
No. You might want to try
the toy store.

45:43.475 --> 45:44.907
Toys and Treasures?

45:44.976 --> 45:46.476
The toy store?

45:49.414 --> 45:50.279
Hello, there.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.914
Merry Christmas.

45:55.386 --> 45:56.819
Isobel.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.087
Wow.

45:58.156 --> 46:01.991
Volunteer firefighter,
contractor, toy sales.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.726
Is there anything
you don't do?

46:03.795 --> 46:07.330
No, it's uh... it's my mom's
business, actually.

46:07.398 --> 46:08.398
I'm just helping out.

46:08.433 --> 46:09.433
Mom, this is Isobel.

46:09.467 --> 46:11.367
She's visiting
from San Diego.

46:11.436 --> 46:12.235
Hi.

46:12.303 --> 46:13.469
The ballerina.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.438
Wow. Well done.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.173
I'm Kathy. Welcome.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.819
Any friend of Jamie's
is a friend of mine.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.010
Oh, well I'm not so sure
we're still friends.

46:21.079 --> 46:24.013
I owe your son a huge apology
for yesterday.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.522
You don't. You don't
owe me anything.

46:25.550 --> 46:26.716
It's fine.

46:26.785 --> 46:27.828
I shouldn't tell you
how to live your life.

46:27.852 --> 46:28.885
I was out of line.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.553
If he says he was, he was.

46:30.622 --> 46:31.954
( laughs )

46:32.023 --> 46:33.063
Who's side are
you on here?

46:33.124 --> 46:34.991
You've always been
an honest boy.

46:35.059 --> 46:36.726
( Door bells jingling )

46:40.131 --> 46:41.864
Santa's gone?

46:41.933 --> 46:43.533
Oh, David.

46:43.601 --> 46:45.768
Santa and his elf just left.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.905
Now how will he know what
I want for Christmas?

46:48.973 --> 46:50.606
I'm so sorry, honey.

46:50.675 --> 46:51.941
You know what?

46:52.010 --> 46:55.645
Don't worry about it,
'cause Santa always knows.

46:55.713 --> 46:58.848
Maybe he's just gone feeding
his reindeer?

46:58.917 --> 47:01.184
( Whispers ) Uh, he's actually
gone for the day.

47:01.252 --> 47:02.785
He's back there changing.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.153
Let me see if I can go
catch him.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.621
Go.

47:18.837 --> 47:20.503
Hey, Jamie?

47:20.572 --> 47:22.805
What's up?

47:22.874 --> 47:25.241
We are.

47:25.310 --> 47:26.142
No.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.345
Ho ho ho hold on a minute.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.782
It's Santa!

47:32.851 --> 47:36.085
And I've got Jingles,
my elf.

47:36.154 --> 47:40.456
And Santa is open
for business!

47:40.525 --> 47:43.960
It turns out that I've got time
for one more visit

47:44.028 --> 47:45.761
before I fly back
to the North Pole.

47:45.830 --> 47:48.998
Yeah, so why don't you
hop on up on Santa's lap

47:49.067 --> 47:53.135
and tell him what you want
for Christmas?

47:56.808 --> 47:57.874
Oh, geez.

47:57.942 --> 48:00.443
You're heavier than you look,
David.

48:00.511 --> 48:01.744
It's David, right?

48:01.813 --> 48:03.479
David Anthony Owens.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.947
Santa knows my name!

48:05.016 --> 48:07.049
Santa knows everything.

48:07.118 --> 48:08.885
That's right.

48:08.953 --> 48:12.488
So tell me David, have you been
a good boy this year?

48:12.557 --> 48:14.223
I thought you knew everything.

48:14.292 --> 48:17.727
Of course I do, I was just-
just double checking.

48:17.795 --> 48:19.762
Um, why don't you go ahead
and uh,

48:19.831 --> 48:22.398
tell Santa what you want
for Christmas?

48:24.836 --> 48:27.203
Oh, he's got a list.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.671
Wow, all that?

48:28.740 --> 48:29.505
Well, go ahead.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.908
Go ahead and tell us.

48:31.976 --> 48:34.777
I want a video game, a
Super Trooper action figure,

48:34.846 --> 48:38.781
a remote control car,
a skateboard, a-

48:38.850 --> 48:42.451
Um, why don't, uh, you just
let Santa surprise you

48:42.520 --> 48:44.053
with something this year?

48:44.122 --> 48:47.623
Why don't you just let go
of your expectations

48:47.692 --> 48:51.360
about Christmas and just
let it happen to you?

48:51.429 --> 48:52.695
How about that?

48:52.764 --> 48:54.931
Hmm, no.

48:54.999 --> 48:59.435
I'd rather have a video game,
a Super Trooper action figure,

48:59.504 --> 49:04.106
a remote control car, a soccer
ball and a baseball mitt.

49:04.175 --> 49:06.075
Ok.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.379
Quite a team, huh?

49:10.448 --> 49:11.914
( laughs )

49:11.983 --> 49:13.115
Be honest though,

49:13.184 --> 49:14.228
did that Santa outfit
make me look fat?

49:14.252 --> 49:16.352
( laughing )

49:16.421 --> 49:18.020
Well, a little bit.

49:18.089 --> 49:19.188
( Phone ringing )

49:19.257 --> 49:22.458
Oh, excuse me.

49:22.527 --> 49:28.831
Jingles the elf here, you've
reached the North Pole.

49:28.900 --> 49:31.000
Do I-do I have
the wrong number?

49:31.069 --> 49:33.169
No, silly, it's me.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.805
I'm just having a little
holiday fun.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.306
Oh, fun.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.808
Oh, I so wish you were here.

49:38.876 --> 49:40.810
It's just not the same
without you.

49:40.878 --> 49:41.989
That's what I hoped to hear.

49:42.013 --> 49:43.312
How's the list coming along?

49:43.381 --> 49:44.381
It's getting there.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.682
I've got so much
to tell you about.

49:46.751 --> 49:49.719
This has really been
the best holiday ever.

49:49.787 --> 49:53.289
I- I mean it could be better,
obviously.

49:53.358 --> 49:54.457
It will be.

49:54.525 --> 49:56.036
Listen, Christmas is still
three days away,

49:56.060 --> 49:58.794
I'm wrapping things up here,
I'll be out on the next flight.

49:58.863 --> 50:01.764
Oh, and keep that elf
outfit handy.

50:01.833 --> 50:04.433
I have a few ideas I want
to run by Santa myself.

50:04.502 --> 50:05.935
Yeah? Ok.

50:06.004 --> 50:06.936
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

50:07.005 --> 50:08.137
Bye.

50:23.888 --> 50:26.622
Thanks, my dear.
Merry Christmas.

50:26.691 --> 50:29.592
Oh, that was so sweet what
you did with David.

50:29.660 --> 50:32.928
Oh, well how many chances
am I ever gonna have to get

50:32.997 --> 50:35.398
my picture taken with Santa?

50:35.466 --> 50:36.999
Not even if you planned it.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.934
Jamie said that you're
in town alone.

50:39.003 --> 50:40.447
If you're not busy,
why don't you come over

50:40.471 --> 50:42.038
and have dinner with us tonight?

50:42.106 --> 50:44.573
Nothing fancy, just family.

50:44.642 --> 50:46.342
Oh, are you sure
I wouldn't be...

50:46.411 --> 50:47.710
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

50:47.779 --> 50:49.979
Ok. Thank you.

51:26.284 --> 51:29.285
I am so glad you could join us
for dinner tonight, Isobel.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.619
Oh, I'm honoured.

51:30.688 --> 51:33.289
It's such a family affair.

51:33.357 --> 51:35.691
Hey Kyle, did you bring
your clarinet tonight?

51:35.760 --> 51:37.626
Maybe you could play us
something later.

51:37.695 --> 51:38.794
Totally.

51:38.863 --> 51:39.863
Yeah?

51:39.897 --> 51:41.697
You won't have to ask
him twice.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.732
He gets that from his father.

51:43.801 --> 51:46.802
A friendly warning, this one
plays the accordion

51:46.871 --> 51:49.638
and he's been practicing
the "Twelve Days of Christmas."

51:49.707 --> 51:52.608
Don't encourage him.

51:52.677 --> 51:54.310
Oh, I forgot Trish's casserole.

51:54.378 --> 51:55.578
Can I help you in the kitchen?

51:55.646 --> 51:57.346
( Together ) No!

51:57.415 --> 51:59.381
No, no.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.851
You told them!

52:01.919 --> 52:03.018
I told everybody.

52:03.087 --> 52:04.687
Awwww!!!!!

52:04.755 --> 52:07.123
( laughter )

52:11.529 --> 52:14.330
Wow, I can't believe you really
made all these yourself.

52:14.398 --> 52:16.265
Just like my mother taught me.

52:16.334 --> 52:19.702
And her mother taught her.

52:19.770 --> 52:22.138
Gee, my mother always said
if it couldn't be delivered

52:22.206 --> 52:23.506
we didn't need it.

52:23.574 --> 52:27.443
( laughs )

52:27.512 --> 52:29.712
That really was such
a delicious dinner, Kathy.

52:29.780 --> 52:32.047
Oh, homemade cooking is all.

52:32.116 --> 52:35.050
Some old family recipes and...

52:35.119 --> 52:36.597
could you grab those napkins
for me, dear?

52:36.621 --> 52:37.486
Oh yeah, of course.

52:37.555 --> 52:38.555
Thanks.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.498
Do these have a special
significance?

52:49.567 --> 52:53.035
Oh, that's a sentimental value.

52:53.104 --> 52:56.205
That's Jamie's first
construction project.

52:56.274 --> 52:58.974
There's nothing that boy
couldn't build.

52:59.043 --> 53:00.242
Yeah.

53:00.311 --> 53:02.077
It helped him through
some difficult years.

53:02.146 --> 53:04.346
Yeah, he told me about
his dad.

53:04.415 --> 53:05.581
Really?

53:05.650 --> 53:08.484
He doesn't like to talk
about those days much.

53:08.553 --> 53:11.587
But those blocks,
they're just like a...

53:11.656 --> 53:14.657
I don't know, a constant
reminder of...

53:14.725 --> 53:17.226
Reminder of what?

53:17.295 --> 53:19.195
Uh, well...

53:19.263 --> 53:22.198
Hey mom, what's going on
with that dessert?

53:22.266 --> 53:22.831
Yeah!

53:22.900 --> 53:24.567
I want some pie!

53:24.635 --> 53:25.768
The natives are restless.

53:25.836 --> 53:27.770
We better get the pie
in there.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.638
You grab that one,
I'll get this one.

53:29.707 --> 53:30.918
<i>( Kyle ): Can I get ice-cream
too!!</i>

53:30.942 --> 53:32.274
Coming!

53:34.412 --> 53:37.580
( Owl hooting )

53:37.648 --> 53:38.881
I love this.

53:38.950 --> 53:41.083
This entire evening.

53:44.422 --> 53:45.621
Just a typical family dinner.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.590
No, no, no. You
don't understand.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.592
I was an only child.

53:49.660 --> 53:52.828
You have got an entire family
of people in there

53:52.897 --> 53:55.197
who love you.

53:55.266 --> 53:57.266
You actually are that
gingerbread family,

53:57.335 --> 53:58.133
you know that?

53:58.202 --> 53:59.202
( laughing )

53:59.270 --> 54:01.904
Do you even know
how special that is?

54:01.973 --> 54:03.939
Well, you're right.

54:04.008 --> 54:06.141
You know, I never thought
of it that way.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.748
<i>Oh, look at those stars.</i>

54:12.817 --> 54:14.583
<i>Wow, have they always been
up there?</i>

54:14.652 --> 54:16.919
Hiding behind your city lights.

54:16.988 --> 54:22.157
Just like people when
they let themselves relax.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.693
Oh, shoot. I got something
for ya.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.929
What?

54:26.998 --> 54:28.130
There you go.

54:28.199 --> 54:29.199
What, for me?

54:29.233 --> 54:30.332
Yeah.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.635
But it's not even Christmas yet.

54:32.703 --> 54:33.636
It's not even-

54:33.704 --> 54:34.837
Just stop.

54:34.905 --> 54:35.704
It's not even Christmas Eve
until tomorrow.

54:35.773 --> 54:37.773
Just open it, it's no big deal.

54:43.214 --> 54:47.916
Oh my goodness.

54:47.985 --> 54:52.621
A- a tree, a gingerbread house,
a sleigh.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.368
Can you believe all the charms
they had there

54:54.392 --> 54:55.924
and not one inner tube?

54:55.993 --> 54:57.226
( laughs )

54:57.295 --> 54:58.694
Not that I could find,
anyway.

54:58.763 --> 55:00.663
What's the question mark?

55:00.731 --> 55:01.864
Oh, well that's uh...

55:01.932 --> 55:04.867
that's your secret Christmas
wish, right?

55:04.935 --> 55:06.413
I don't-I don't even know
what to say.

55:06.437 --> 55:12.574
This is just the most
thoughtful, perfect gift.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.976
I didn't get you anything.

55:14.045 --> 55:15.277
No, don't.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.212
It's fine.

55:17.281 --> 55:18.847
The point is I just...

55:18.916 --> 55:21.350
I saw something and I thought
you would like it

55:21.419 --> 55:22.551
I love it.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.285
Good.

55:23.354 --> 55:24.853
Thank you.

55:26.023 --> 55:28.524
So much, for everything.

55:33.197 --> 55:35.030
You're welcome.

55:37.435 --> 55:41.103
( Message alert )

55:41.172 --> 55:42.504
Is that important?

55:42.573 --> 55:43.839
Yeah, it's Brett.

55:43.908 --> 55:49.144
He's in a cab on his way
from Portland.

55:49.213 --> 55:50.746
Oh.

55:50.815 --> 55:54.416
Should... should I bring you
back, or...?

55:54.485 --> 55:57.486
Um, probably. Yeah.

55:57.555 --> 55:59.355
Ok.

55:59.423 --> 56:00.989
Thank you.

56:09.567 --> 56:10.933
Looks like he's already here.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.168
No need to walk me up.

56:13.237 --> 56:14.002
Oh.

56:14.071 --> 56:14.870
Why, are you embarrassed?

56:14.939 --> 56:15.871
Is he super short?

56:15.940 --> 56:16.872
Does he have a unibrow?

56:16.941 --> 56:18.273
Is he like 94 years old?

56:18.342 --> 56:19.775
Because you can tell me.

56:19.844 --> 56:20.909
( laughs )

56:20.978 --> 56:22.144
No.

56:22.213 --> 56:25.381
He's young and handsome
and perfectly normal.

56:25.449 --> 56:27.883
You can't imagine how sad
it makes me to hear that.

56:27.952 --> 56:30.285
I wondered what happened
to you.

56:30.354 --> 56:31.153
Hey!

56:31.222 --> 56:32.621
Hey.

56:32.690 --> 56:33.756
Who is this?

56:33.824 --> 56:36.258
Oh, this is a friend
I met in town.

56:36.327 --> 56:38.961
Jamie Haughton, Brett Bishop.

56:39.029 --> 56:40.029
Hey, Brett.

56:40.097 --> 56:40.929
Oh yeah, like the company,
right?

56:40.998 --> 56:42.198
See? I told him all about you.

56:42.266 --> 56:43.266
That's funny.

56:43.334 --> 56:45.734
I haven't heard a word
about you.

56:45.803 --> 56:47.136
Oh...

56:47.204 --> 56:48.515
Why don't you come inside
and join us for a minute?

56:48.539 --> 56:49.539
No, no, I don't-

56:49.573 --> 56:51.607
Come on, I insist.

56:51.675 --> 56:52.541
Ok.

56:52.610 --> 56:53.776
Let's get out of this cold.

56:53.844 --> 56:54.943
It's freezing out here!

56:55.012 --> 56:56.012
Ok.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.814
He insists.

56:58.883 --> 57:00.482
Alright.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.255
Wow, Brett.

57:06.323 --> 57:07.723
You arranged all of this?

57:07.792 --> 57:09.458
This is so...

57:09.527 --> 57:10.826
It's romantic.

57:10.895 --> 57:14.296
Sit, sit. Jamie, grab that
cushion thing there.

57:14.365 --> 57:16.165
Sorry about the wine,

57:16.233 --> 57:17.533
I specifically asked
my assistant

57:17.601 --> 57:19.468
for white and he sent red.

57:19.537 --> 57:20.636
He'll hear from me.

57:20.704 --> 57:22.571
Off with his head!

57:25.142 --> 57:26.909
Oh, you're serious?

57:26.977 --> 57:31.580
So you um, you live up here,
do you?

57:31.649 --> 57:32.781
Yeah.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.616
Yeah, Jamie's family has been
so great.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.785
They've really been keeping
me busy.

57:36.854 --> 57:38.253
Well, how lucky for Isobel.

57:38.322 --> 57:41.256
I mean, I can't imagine there's
much to do in a town this size.

57:41.325 --> 57:44.193
Feed the livestock,
watch the stop light change.

57:44.261 --> 57:45.093
Ha.

57:45.162 --> 57:46.829
Yeah, well don't fool yourself,

57:46.897 --> 57:48.797
it can get pretty crazy
around here.

57:48.866 --> 57:50.833
The library got a new book
last month.

57:50.901 --> 57:52.134
Pandemonium.

57:52.203 --> 57:56.839
( laughing )

57:56.907 --> 57:59.374
Sorry about the uh,
coffee mug.

57:59.443 --> 58:04.112
They only sent two proper
glasses with the delivery.

58:04.181 --> 58:06.949
Uh, what should we toast to?

58:07.017 --> 58:09.318
Small town charms?

58:09.386 --> 58:11.887
Um, how about to Christmas?

58:11.956 --> 58:13.188
To Christmas.

58:13.257 --> 58:15.357
Yes.

58:15.426 --> 58:17.626
To Christmas.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.761
Cheers.

58:19.830 --> 58:22.564
Don't break it.

58:22.633 --> 58:23.665
Oh, I almost forgot.

58:23.734 --> 58:25.234
I found your list.

58:25.302 --> 58:26.468
You weren't kidding.

58:26.537 --> 58:27.537
You have been busy.

58:27.571 --> 58:28.648
I mean, look at this thing.

58:28.672 --> 58:30.272
Check, check, check,
check, check.

58:30.341 --> 58:32.908
You know, when Izzy puts
her mind to something...

58:32.977 --> 58:34.309
That's our Izzy.

58:34.378 --> 58:36.278
Um, believe it or not,

58:36.347 --> 58:39.147
most of these things on this
list just kind of happened.

58:39.250 --> 58:41.261
Oh please, you don't let
anything just kinda happen.

58:41.285 --> 58:44.086
So come on, what've you saved
for me?

58:44.154 --> 58:45.654
Um, well let's see here.

58:45.723 --> 58:49.024
We have ice skating
and Christmas caroling,

58:49.093 --> 58:50.192
I haven't done that yet.

58:50.261 --> 58:51.960
Ok, uh, ice skating.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.395
We'll do it first thing
tomorrow,

58:53.464 --> 58:55.375
tick it off the list and get
this thing back on track.

58:55.399 --> 58:58.300
You, sir, look like a bit of
a sportsman.

58:58.369 --> 59:00.736
Uh, do you know of
a frozen lake nearby?

59:00.804 --> 59:04.606
Uh, there is one actually,
but it's not safe to skate on.

59:04.675 --> 59:06.508
Oh, that's a shame.

59:06.577 --> 59:10.045
Ok, well, we'll build a snowman,
or make a fruit cake.

59:10.114 --> 59:12.848
I mean, it's not rally that
important what we do, is it?

59:16.887 --> 59:18.220
Hey, you know,

59:18.289 --> 59:20.689
for what it's worth there
is an indoor rink in town.

59:20.758 --> 59:21.857
It doesn't open 'til noon

59:21.926 --> 59:23.725
but I can probably grab you
the keys,

59:23.794 --> 59:24.860
slide you guys in early.

59:24.929 --> 59:26.395
There you go. Good man.

59:26.463 --> 59:27.496
Problem solved.

59:27.565 --> 59:29.131
Great, I'll set that up
for tomorrow.

59:29.199 --> 59:30.032
I should go.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.211
I've got family waiting, and-

59:31.235 --> 59:32.167
Yes, you should.

59:32.236 --> 59:33.869
You should go.

59:33.938 --> 59:36.772
Well, it was...
interesting meeting you.

59:36.840 --> 59:37.639
Yeah, yeah.

59:37.708 --> 59:38.718
Geez, what a surprise, huh?

59:38.742 --> 59:43.478
Surprises all around.

59:43.547 --> 59:45.847
Hey, um, will you please
tell your family thank you

59:45.916 --> 59:47.115
from me again?

59:47.184 --> 59:49.017
Yeah, for sure.

59:49.086 --> 59:51.053
Thanks for coming.

59:51.121 --> 59:52.421
Thank you.

59:52.489 --> 59:53.522
Ok, have a good night.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.524
Yeah, you too. Goodnight.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:18.747
Seventh place?

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:21.416
I didn't know they gave
ribbons for that.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:25.587
I do not see a future for you
in gingerbread.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:28.724
You know, I didn't uh, I didn't
tell you about my trip.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.626
Let me tell you, once this
factory is set up

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:34.129
we can expand into the entire
South American market.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:40.602
Argentina, Ecuador, I mean how
is that for a New Year's plan?

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.705
Hmm?

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:55.183
Looks like someone's had
a long day.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.702
Is your boyfriend sleeping in,
Izzy?

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:17.673
No, he had some mysterious
errand to run.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.875
Firing assistants?
Trip to South America?

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.810
Nothing quite that elaborate.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.011
I hope.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.346
But you never know.

01:01:24.415 --> 01:01:25.781
Can I give you a hand
with that?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.115
Yes, please.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.717
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:31.053
How did you get the key,
anyway?

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.321
I'm very tight with the owner.

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:33.588
Oh yeah?

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:34.923
( laughs )

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.658
I used to work here
when I was a kid.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:37.859
You did?

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:38.938
Yeah. I did a lot of odd jobs
back then

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.729
to help the family out.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:43.598
Paper route, gardening,
car wash.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:45.200
Bicycle repair.

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:47.402
Just 'til you found
construction?

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:48.471
That's right.

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:49.938
Building something
out of nothing.

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:52.574
There's nothing like the feeling
of accomplishment, you know?

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.177
Yeah. And it's always been here?

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.412
You've never lived
anywhere else?

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:58.513
No.

01:01:58.582 --> 01:01:59.881
Well, college.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:04.186
Other than that Fall River's
been home.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.787
You know it
when you find it.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:06.955
You wake up every morning

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.925
and your heart just feels right,
you know?

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:14.129
Probably how you feel
about San Diego, right?

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:17.099
Gosh, I can just imagine
how beautiful this must be

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:21.169
when it's filled with couples,
arm in arm,

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:27.342
twirling gracefully
around each other.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.955
It's actually just a bunch
of awkward kids

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:30.879
tripping over each other
usually, but...

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:33.415
( laughs )

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:35.617
You have a very
vivid fantasy life.

01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:39.387
Well, I've heard that before.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:41.456
Ok.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:42.424
Alright.

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:43.525
Woah.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:46.661
So have you...
have you skated before?

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:50.265
Um, well... no.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:52.400
No, I haven't skated before.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:53.668
Ever.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.137
Alright.

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.349
You want me to come out with
you and give you a few pointers?

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.973
Yes, please.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:02:59.041
Definitely.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:07.449
You're on your own.

01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:08.984
No. Not on my own.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:12.454
We'll fix that fast.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.890
( laughing )

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.758
This is fun.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.763
Woooo.

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:25.400
( Shrieking )

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.169
( laughing )

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:28.237
Oh my goodness!

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.571
( laughing )

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.305
Are you ok?

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:31.439
Yeah.

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.819
Looks like I got here
just in time.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:33.542
Oh, hey.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:34.476
Hey, Brett.

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:36.711
Hey. Do you mind if I cut in?

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.013
Yeah, of course.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.381
Might need to hold onto her.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.249
Yeah.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.451
Roses? This time of year?

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.588
Well, you know me when I set
my mind to something.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:48.557
Hey, thanks again for
setting this up, guy.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:49.791
Yeah. Of course.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:53.295
So you guys, it's yours
'til noon so have fun.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:54.363
Great.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:55.530
Thank you.

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:56.731
Oh, hey.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.401
Can you put these
in some water for us?

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:02.604
Sure.

01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:03.505
Thanks.

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.140
Yeah.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.445
Hi.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:11.980
Hi.

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:14.227
Look, I know this doesn't make
up for all the time we missed

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.018
but it's a start.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.020
It's a beautiful start.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.089
Should we do this?

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.289
Yes.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.558
Um, now before we get started
I just...

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:24.826
don't feel embarrassed.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:25.827
Ok.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:26.761
It's really slippery, this.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:27.662
I'm gonna give it a shot.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:28.330
Ok.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:29.197
Wish me luck.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:30.765
I'm here if you need me.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:36.705
( laughing )

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:38.006
Something like that?

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.507
A little something like that.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.643
How did you learn how to skate?

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:42.978
I'm from Chicago, remember?

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.980
There's nothing else to do
in the winters there.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.082
Well, that's a good point.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:48.150
Shall we?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.050
Yes.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.685
Let's try.

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:54.456
Ooh, you got it. That's it.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.758
That's good! Really good.

01:04:56.827 --> 01:04:57.827
Are you up for a turn?

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.160
Uh, yes.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.663
Woah.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:08.303
This is quaint.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.972
I suppose a nice Bordeaux
is out of the question.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:16.278
Hey, why don't we just relax
and let the holidays happen?

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:19.214
Just let Christmas be whatever
it's supposed to be.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:21.216
Take it as it comes.

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.445
That does not sound like you.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.219
Where did you hear that?

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:26.021
Around.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.590
Well hello there.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:30.225
Hi, Patty.

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:32.460
This is my boyfriend, Brett.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:33.728
Ah.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:37.198
Turkey platter special tonight,
all the fixings.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.667
What could they do to turkey,
right?

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.335
Ok, good. We'll take
two of those.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:41.703
All white meat for me,
no skin.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:44.439
Instead of potatoes,
extra veggies, lightly steamed,

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:45.874
gravy on the side.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.153
I'm sure I don't even need
to say no bread, no butter.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.476
No, you do not.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:49.989
Oh, I don't suppose you have
a gluten free option?

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:52.013
I don't suppose so.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:53.148
Will that be it?

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.650
That's perfect.
Thank you, Patty.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:01.890
Ok, so we've got the skating
thing out of the way,

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.170
how soon do you think we can
get the rest of this list done

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:05.894
and just relax?

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:09.698
You know what?

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:12.067
About that list, we can just
forget it.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.635
It's... it's silly.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:15.470
I mean, it's been fun

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.072
but honestly nothing
really worked out

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.540
the way I planned it.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:19.941
( laughs )

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:20.842
I didn't think so.

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:23.211
I mean, that gingerbread house?

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.546
What were you thinking?

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:28.817
I don't know.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:31.853
Do you wanna just
head back home?

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:32.821
You mean it?

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.289
Oh, that would be amazing.

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:38.059
I mean, I'm sorry, but this
just isn't my idea of Christmas.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.694
No.

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:43.231
Merry Christmas.
I can't forget you.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.332
Aww.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.202
Jamie, you're such
a sweetheart.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:48.670
Are you here to join
your friends?

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:50.472
Hey.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.339
Hey.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:52.907
Hey, guys.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.175
Uh, how was the ice?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:55.310
Great.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:57.612
We're heading to California.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:01.249
Oh. What, before Christmas?

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:06.654
Fall River's a nice little town
but it's just not for us.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:07.889
Right.

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.991
You'll always have Paris
I guess, huh?

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.192
Paris?

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.861
So great to meet both of you.

01:07:12.929 --> 01:07:14.062
Take care.

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:16.331
Um, if you're ever back this way
look me up, ok?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.999
Jamie.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.005
What was that all about?

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:28.410
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go
clear something up.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.145
Uh, Izzy.

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.084
Jamie, wait.

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:42.123
Hey, you know we're
just friends, right?

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:44.025
You're clear on that?

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.593
What's your point?

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:48.096
Well, we're very
different people.

01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:50.165
Yeah, I think we've established
that.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:51.633
Several times now, probably.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:55.703
Stop being so agreeable.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:59.140
Isobel, I'm just gonna throw
this out there, ok?

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.575
That guy's not right for you.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:01.976
How would you know?

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.478
I mean, he obviously cares
about you

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:07.115
but he cares about himself
and his work more.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.583
Who would pass up
the opportunity

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:12.353
to spend a week alone with you?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.056
Honestly, he'd have
to be crazy.

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.340
No apologies this time.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.542
But I promise you I will
leave you alone

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:38.513
if that's what you want.
Is it?

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.482
Is it what?

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.950
Is that what you want?

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.488
Yeah. I-yeah, of course
that's what I want.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.992
Ok.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.694
Nothing else for me
to say then.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.240
Wait!

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.292
Everything alright out here?

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.777
Hey, what is this?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.078
Hey, you weren't supposed
to open that until tomorrow.

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:47.615
Oh, we always open our presents
Christmas Eve.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.684
Christmas Eve morning?

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:49.895
I've never been good at waiting,

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.279
you must know that
about me by now.

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:55.390
You would think that
I would but I didn't.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.158
Exciting.

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:01.829
It's a... a shirt.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.666
For a fashion guy
you're pretty quick.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.434
Do you like it?

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:07.635
Yeah, sure.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.972
It's... uh, it's the right size
and everything.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.273
Maybe a little woodsy.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.475
Well, I know it's a little
not your usual style

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.377
but it's perfect
for the weather,

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:18.079
it's your favourite colour.

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:19.959
I got it when I thought
we were gonna be up here

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:21.249
for a little bit longer.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:23.751
Yeah. Actually blue is
my favourite colour.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.519
Blue?

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:25.453
Yeah.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:27.322
No way.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:31.559
It's the thought that counts
and it was a very nice thought.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:32.327
Thank you.

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:33.428
You're welcome.

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:34.429
And now that
we're opening things...

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:35.663
You're opening things.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.732
Part one of your
Christmas present.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.234
Oh. Part one.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:40.302
Yeah, I-

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.414
My goodness,
what could it be?

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:42.537
I called in some favours.

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:43.938
Oh?

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:47.242
And organized a private plane
to take us home today.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:50.478
Oh. Uh, my goodness.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:52.013
That's something.

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:52.914
I know, right?

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:54.148
Wow.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.394
And this is a holiday
that we can both enjoy.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.720
Totally. That's...
this is perfect.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.488
I know.

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:01.557
Let's start packing.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:02.357
Ok.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:03.992
Great.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:13.301
So I know we have these
international plans

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.137
but I have this idea
for a new line.

01:11:16.206 --> 01:11:18.973
A main street boutique,
my own personal designs.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:19.941
More casual.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:20.842
Izzy-

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.043
Hear me out.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:24.112
What if the next big thing
isn't global?

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.281
What if it's back home?

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:28.116
Small town America?

01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:29.317
You know?

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:30.529
We could open a separate
division and do it

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.187
from, well, anywhere.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.322
I don't think so.

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:35.089
I- oh.

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:37.959
( Text alert )

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:38.726
Oh, sorry.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.295
It's a text from Hugo.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:41.429
Important?

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:44.332
They're all important.
Just one sec.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.634
What is he doing?

01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:48.870
( Message alert )

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:51.639
Oh, shoot, you know what,
I need to check that text.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.744
It's Hugo.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.081
Does he know
it's Christmas Eve?

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:03.618
He does, but apparently
our new equipment doesn't.

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:07.355
But you know it's
Christmas Eve, right?

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:08.690
Sorry.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.436
I just really hoped we were
gonna have a chance

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.959
to spend some time together.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.294
Oh, unbelievable.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.940
He wants to shut down
production for two weeks.

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:16.097
No, no, no.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.233
There goes half our fabric
for the month.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:20.668
You know what?
You deal with that.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.637
I'll be right back.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:29.544
Sorry, we're just closing.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:31.713
Oh, Kathy, it's me.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.481
Oh, Isobel.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:34.550
Hi.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.821
Um, is there something
I can help you with?

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:40.588
Oh, no.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:43.057
I was just passing by.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:46.394
My boyfriend and I are heading
back to California.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.763
Mom, I got four more
of these...

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:51.733
Oh, honey, I'll put those away
so you two can talk

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:55.436
before Isobel flies off
to California.

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:00.408
Hey.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:03.077
Hey.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:04.545
I'm really glad you're here.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.080
I was hoping you would be.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:07.949
I hated the way we left
things yesterday.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:10.084
Yeah, uh, yeah.
That's my fault.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.452
I keep...

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:13.399
I keep saying things
around you that I don't mean.

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:14.989
You didn't mean
what you said?

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.157
No, no.

01:13:16.226 --> 01:13:18.659
No, I did, I mean,
the good things, I did.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.595
The bad things, I didn't,

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:22.096
but you can decide
which is which.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:25.233
( laughs )

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:28.836
So this is it, huh?
You're leaving?

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:33.341
As the song says, I'll be home
for Christmas.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.876
Nah.

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.812
What is with you and
holiday pop culture?

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:40.081
I'm sorry.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:43.084
Well, I'm really glad
you came here.

01:13:43.153 --> 01:13:44.952
Even if you didn't make it
to Christmas.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:50.658
Maybe I'll get it right
next year.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.461
Do those still sell?

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.632
Uh, yeah.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.333
Yeah, they do, actually.

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:03.504
Always a market for nostalgia
I suppose.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.907
I saw some like this
in your mom's kitchen

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.676
when I came over for dinner.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:12.413
She started to tell me a story
about them.

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:13.815
Right.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:17.985
Well, you're not the only one
with stories I guess.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:21.189
Care to share?

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:25.126
After my dad died I
kinda lost myself in work.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:28.196
You know all those jobs
I told you about?

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.964
You were doing
what you had to.

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.532
Just trying to help provide.

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.301
Yeah. That's what I told myself

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:38.439
but I was really just avoiding
the feelings, you know?

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:42.176
So I made sure I didn't have
time for them.

01:14:42.245 --> 01:14:43.245
That makes sense.

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:45.012
Nothing to be ashamed of.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.749
No, I know that now.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.320
Because I-I found a set of
these in the attic

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:53.988
and the joy just came back.

01:14:54.057 --> 01:15:01.662
Just a simple thing,
stacking one on top of another.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.564
It made me realize

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:05.666
that life isn't about
a paycheque, you know?

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:07.435
It's about living full out.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:10.037
It's about creating something
that means something to you

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:12.840
and leaving a bit of yourself
in the world.

01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:13.909
Yeah.

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:15.309
Yeah.

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:18.646
I hope that you find something
like that, I truly do.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:22.416
Because you really
deserve it.

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:25.887
Thank you.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.188
I gotta go.

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:30.258
I gotta-I gotta do a few things
and uh, get home.

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:32.527
Christmas.

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:35.162
Have a safe flight, ok?

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.564
Merry Christmas.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.366
Merry Christmas.

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:43.771
Ok.

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:24.946
He's um... he's a good man,
Isobel.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.415
And he has a soft spot
for you.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:29.283
You challenge him.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:32.186
He needs someone like that.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.121
And maybe you do, too.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.524
What makes you say that?

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:41.495
I think it's pretty obvious
to both of us.

01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:33.080
The pilot says ten minutes,
we'll be on our way.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:37.084
Have I seen that jacket before?

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:42.023
Yes, I've been wearing it
all day.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:44.291
Plus, you saw the sketches.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360
That's one of yours?

01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:46.827
Mmmhmm.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:49.430
Yeah, it wasn't right
for the market.

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.799
Ah. Right. Right.

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:53.434
Hey, Brett.

01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:54.301
Mmm.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.405
Did you have any fun?

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:58.639
Sure I did.

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:01.308
Like what?

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:04.278
The... the skating,
that was great.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:08.816
Of course, we could have found
a rink in California.

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:11.752
You know, I really wanted this
to be such a special time,

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:14.822
Christmas with
all the trimmings.

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:16.957
You know how important
this holiday was to me.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.260
I know that everything
didn't work out exactly

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:22.029
as you had hoped but we gave it
our best, right?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.133
Uh oh.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.702
I know that look.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.438
Listen, I know we didn't get
as much time as you'd like,

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:32.473
but I will be with you as soon
as I can see

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:35.042
why these figures
aren't adding up.

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:47.321
I can't go with you
to California.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.356
No, not right now.

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:50.858
What?

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:54.862
Something happened
to me up here.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:55.931
Your business idea?

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:56.897
Ok, you know what?

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:58.365
That's my fault,
I was too hasty.

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.412
We'll set up a meeting with
our distributor in the New Year,

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:03.170
you present your proposal
and I will keep an open mind.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.405
I mean it.

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:07.041
I know you will, Brett,
that's not the point.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.442
It's not about that.

01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:09.710
So what is it?

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.479
Is it... is it Jamie?

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:13.114
It's not Jamie.

01:19:13.182 --> 01:19:14.815
It's not anyone.

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:16.751
If it is, it's me.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.986
Ok, well I don't get that
at all.

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:20.654
I know you don't.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:22.000
And I don't really get it,
either.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.525
But the simple truth is
you have some place

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:26.794
you have to be right now
and I don't.

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:30.664
So I am going to take
some time for myself.

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:31.565
Here?

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:32.867
Mmmhmm.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.279
Yeah, the cabin is paid for
through the week.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:35.236
So...

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:36.570
What're you gonna do?

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:42.610
I have absolutely no idea.
Isn't that exciting?

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.645
Isobel.

Caroling?

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:35.556
What're you doing?
I thought you...

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:36.891
I wanna watch.

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:39.994
It's either them or hot
chocolate with marshmallows.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.363
Your choice.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:43.597
Hot chocolate.

01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:45.099
Let's go.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.373
So is this the end of it then?

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.108
Well, almost.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:57.278
I do have two bits
of business remaining.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:00.447
I need to find a construction
company to help me

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:03.317
with a business I'm thinking
of starting.

01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:06.220
I thought maybe you might
know someone.

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:08.555
Thinking of branching out
on your own, are you?

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:13.260
I'd have to find the right shop
in the right town first.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:16.363
I'm all over it.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.532
That's-that's only one thing,
though.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.134
You said there were
two bits left.

01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:23.237
Oh, I did, didn't I?

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:25.306
Well...

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:29.510
A-ha.

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:31.845
Oh, right.

01:22:31.914 --> 01:22:35.916
The secret Christmas wish.

01:22:35.985 --> 01:22:38.085
Hang on.

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:44.992
( laughing )

01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:49.463
To kiss a man I love
under the mistletoe.

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.635
Is there a story behind that,
too?

01:22:54.704 --> 01:22:56.904
Not yet.

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:59.173
But I'm hoping there will be.
