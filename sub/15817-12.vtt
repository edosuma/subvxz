06:28.922 --> 06:29.590
VERY.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.758
CAN YOU LOOK AT MY EYES?

06:30.758 --> 06:32.059
I'VE BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY

06:32.059 --> 06:34.895
A LONG TIME, AND IT'S NO JOKE.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.296
YOU CAN'T JUST POP UP ONE DAY

06:36.296 --> 06:37.798
AND SAY YOU WANT TO BE A SINGER.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.299
SO IF ARIANE WANTS TO COME AND

06:39.299 --> 06:41.001
AUDITION AND HOP INTO THIS,

06:41.001 --> 06:42.803
SHE BETTER HAVE SOME TOUGH SKIN,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.071
AND THE CHICK BETTER KNOW

06:44.071 --> 06:44.905
HOW TO SING.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.939
I AIN'T PLAYING NO GAMES.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.475
I'M NOT SHOWING NO FAVORITISM,

06:47.475 --> 06:48.476
ARIANE.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.477
WHO IN THE [bleep] IS ASKING

06:49.477 --> 06:50.544
YOU TO SHOW ANY FAVORITISM?

06:50.544 --> 06:51.378
NO, I KNOW MY FRIENDS.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.279
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO SHOW ME

06:52.279 --> 06:53.547
NO FAVORITISM.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.381
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

06:54.381 --> 06:56.584
IT'S A JOB.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.818
IT'S A JOB, AND IT'S WORK,

06:57.818 --> 06:59.753
AND I WORK HARD AT WHAT I

06:59.753 --> 07:00.654
BELIEVE IN AND WHAT

07:00.654 --> 07:01.889
I WANT TO DO.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.090
I HAVE TO DO IT.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.492
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.394
I WILL GET YOU THE DATE,

07:07.394 --> 07:08.896
TIME, AND PLACE.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.564
GET READY TO SING.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.231
I WILL.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.500
YOU KNOW, ATL, THEY GOT

07:12.500 --> 07:13.767
A LOT OF CHICKEN AND CORN BREAD

07:13.767 --> 07:14.502
AND MACARONI.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.302
THAT MAKES YOU KNOW

07:15.302 --> 07:15.969
HOW TO SING.

07:15.969 --> 07:16.637
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

07:16.637 --> 07:17.505
MISS SKIPPY ATTITUDE BITCH.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.306
YOU KNOW THIS [bleep].

07:23.511 --> 07:24.512
SO STEVIE'S BEEN ACTING

07:24.512 --> 07:25.713
REALLY NICE LATELY.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.314
FIRST HE SHOWS UP WITH THIS CAR,

07:27.314 --> 07:28.516
AND THEN HE WANTS TO SPEND TIME

07:28.516 --> 07:29.883
WITH EVA AND I AT THE PARK.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.184
I'M NOT MAD RIGHT NOW.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.185
HELLO.

07:32.185 --> 07:32.853
HI.

07:32.853 --> 07:33.521
HOW ARE YOU?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.187
FINE.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.055
LOOK AMAZING AS USUAL.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.723
THANK YOU.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.524
LET ME GET THIS CHAIR

07:36.524 --> 07:37.124
FOR YOU.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.191
SO WHEN HE CALLED ME UP

07:38.191 --> 07:39.527
TO HAVE LUNCH, I KNEW SOMETHING

07:39.527 --> 07:40.728
HAD TO BE UP.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.596
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO FIGURE OUT

07:42.596 --> 07:43.531
WHAT THIS IS.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.832
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.299
DEALIN' WITH ME, THERE'S A LOT

07:46.299 --> 07:47.200
OF PERKS.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.669
WHAT COMES ALONG WITH THESE

07:48.669 --> 07:50.237
"PERKS"?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.572
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.305
N-N-NO.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.907
THE GOLD PACKAGE,

07:53.907 --> 07:54.808
DIAMOND PACKAGE,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.309
PLATINUM PACKAGE...

07:56.309 --> 07:57.444
EXPLAIN THE PACKAGE.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.445
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS

07:58.445 --> 07:59.613
"PACKAGE" TERMINOLOGY.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.549
LIKE, YOU SPEAK IN THESE RIDDLES

08:01.549 --> 08:02.916
AND LUCKY CHARMS AND [bleep].

08:02.916 --> 08:03.617
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.585
DON'T SAY I KNOW.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.586
I WANT IT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

08:05.586 --> 08:06.253
TO ME--

08:06.253 --> 08:07.320
YOU CAME TO ME, AND YOU SAID

08:07.320 --> 08:08.556
YOU WANTED TO GO SHOPPING.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.657
I GAVE YOU SOME BANDS.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.658
NO, NO, I DIDN'T

08:10.658 --> 08:11.759
COME TO YOU AND SAY I WANTED

08:11.759 --> 08:12.459
TO DO ANYTHING.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.126
[laughs]

08:13.126 --> 08:14.828
YOU CALLED ME AND SAID,

08:14.828 --> 08:16.864
"MA, YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MALL?

08:16.864 --> 08:17.631
YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF

08:17.631 --> 08:18.732
SOMETHING NICE?"

08:18.732 --> 08:20.033
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT THE BREAD.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.101
BUT WHAT DID I GET?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.103
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.037
YOU KNOW.

08:24.037 --> 08:24.705
NO, I DON'T.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.839
WHAT SHOULD I WANT?

08:25.839 --> 08:26.707
SAY IT.

08:26.707 --> 08:30.177
A LITTLE BIT OF LETTUCE.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.378
HE ASKED ME FOR SOME

08:31.378 --> 08:32.713
LETTUCE.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.648
HEAD OF LETTUCE.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.883
REALLY?

08:35.883 --> 08:36.650
I MEAN...

08:36.650 --> 08:40.220
[laughs]

08:40.220 --> 08:41.354
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.124
DIDN'T I GET YOU A CAR?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.393
WHEN YOU GAVE ME THAT CAR,

08:46.393 --> 08:47.828
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.598
DID I NOT?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.600
SOMETHING ABOUT STRINGS.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.233
ATTACHED.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.234
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:54.234 --> 08:54.902
I THOUGHT WE JUST DO

08:54.902 --> 08:56.069
NICE THINGS FOR EACH OTHER.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.070
[laughs]

08:57.070 --> 08:59.039
SO I CAN'T GET A MEAL?

08:59.039 --> 08:59.840
CAN YOU MAKE ME A STEAK?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.308
WE CAN GO TO HOUSTON'S.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.509
HOUSTON'S?

09:02.509 --> 09:03.343

09:03.343 --> 09:04.011

09:05.613 --> 09:06.614
AND MAKE ME A STEAK.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.247
YOU WANT ME TO GET

09:07.247 --> 09:07.915

09:07.915 --> 09:08.616
YEAH.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.382

09:09.382 --> 09:10.851

09:11.518 --> 09:12.385

09:12.385 --> 09:14.221

09:14.221 --> 09:15.388
HE GIVES ME SOMETHING,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.089
HE EXPECTS ME

09:16.089 --> 09:17.424
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.760
I'M NOT [bleep] YOU ANYMORE.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.861
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE.

09:20.861 --> 09:21.528
YOU WANT TO SLEEP

09:21.528 --> 09:22.329
WITH PROSTITUTES.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.764
YOU GO DO THAT.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.966
[imitates tires screeching]

09:25.966 --> 09:27.367
NO MORE.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.637
HERE.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.270
MM-KAY.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.271
TAKE THAT CAR.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.873
I WILL GET MY OWN CAR,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.074
AND I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET ME

09:34.074 --> 09:34.875
SOMETHING IF YOU'RE GONNA

09:34.875 --> 09:36.409
HOLD IT OVER MY HEAD.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.045
I DO WHAT I WANT.

09:38.045 --> 09:38.712
CLEARLY.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.047
I GOT TO GO.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.882
I'M THE BANK OF THE ATL.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.250
BANKS DON'T OFFER. YOU OFFER.

09:43.250 --> 09:43.951
SO YOU DECIDE--

09:43.951 --> 09:44.818
THEY OFFER LOANS.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.886
IT'S PERCENT ON THAT MONEY.

09:45.886 --> 09:46.654
WELL, THAT WASN'T A LOAN.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.454
I WANT MY PLATINUM PACKAGE

09:47.454 --> 09:48.121

09:48.121 --> 09:48.956

09:53.661 --> 09:55.896
YES, I NEED A TAXI.

09:55.896 --> 09:56.997
ONE MINUTE, THERE'S NO OTHER

09:56.997 --> 09:58.331
PERSON--JUST ME, YOU, AND DREW--

09:58.331 --> 09:59.066
AND THE NEXT MINUTE--

09:59.066 --> 09:59.733
ONE MINUTE?

09:59.733 --> 10:00.668
SEVEN YEARS.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.002
THAT'S NOT ONE MINUTE.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.236
YOU--YOU LIVE IN A WORLD

10:03.236 --> 10:04.104
OF DOUBLE STANDARDS.

10:04.104 --> 10:04.872
NO, I DON'T. I DON'T.

10:04.872 --> 10:05.873
AND THIS IS BULL[bleep].

10:05.873 --> 10:07.808
SHE SOUNDED LIKE A CAT

10:07.808 --> 10:08.676
DYING IN HEAT.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.342
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

10:09.342 --> 10:10.077
TRYING TO DO--IT'S FINE.

10:10.077 --> 10:10.744
I'M NOT TRYING

10:10.744 --> 10:11.544
TO DO ANYTHING.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.212
STOP.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.613
IT'S NOT EVEN--IT'S NOT EVEN--

10:13.613 --> 10:15.615
FOR REAL, THOUGH.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.060
MY SON CAME TO ME,

10:27.060 --> 10:28.095
AND HE SAID, "MA,

10:28.095 --> 10:29.663
YOU AND ERICA COME TOGETHER

10:29.663 --> 10:30.864
AND MANAGE THE FINANCES

10:30.864 --> 10:33.133
SO YOU BOTH CAN TAKE CARE

10:33.133 --> 10:34.334
OF PRINCESS EMANI."

10:34.334 --> 10:35.002
HEY.

10:35.002 --> 10:35.669

10:37.004 --> 10:38.271
THANK YOU.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.673
AND WHAT'S THE QUEEN TO DO,

10:39.673 --> 10:41.474
IS TO HONOR THE REQUEST

10:41.474 --> 10:43.176
OF THE PRINCE.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.545
WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES,

10:45.545 --> 10:46.880
AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH 'EM.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.382
WE'RE A WORK IN PROGRESS.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.383
BUT, UM...

10:50.383 --> 10:51.885

10:54.254 --> 10:56.289

11:01.161 --> 11:02.295
IT'S ALL ABOUT EMANI BECAUSE--

'CAUSE WE HERE TO MAKE

11:04.064 --> 11:04.765
EMANI HAPPY.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.734
SO WHAT--WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.201
I THINK YOU TWO WOULD BE

11:08.201 --> 11:10.537

11:13.540 --> 11:14.607
I DON'T WANT HIM.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.809
I DO WANT ONE THING FROM HIM,

11:15.809 --> 11:16.609
THOUGH:

11:16.609 --> 11:17.945
FINANCIAL STABILITY,

11:17.945 --> 11:18.779
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

11:18.779 --> 11:19.880
TO EMANI.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.248
SCRAPPY AND I HAD AN AGREEMENT

11:21.248 --> 11:22.750
WHEN IT CAME TO THE FINANCES.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.984
I WILL TAKE HIM OFF

11:23.984 --> 11:25.986
CHILD SUPPORT AS LONG AS

11:25.986 --> 11:27.287

11:27.287 --> 11:29.356
FINANCIALLY, WHATEVER I ASK FOR,

11:29.356 --> 11:30.657
HE WOULD GIVE IT TO ME.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.959
BUT NOW THAT HE'S IN JAIL,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.761
THE AGREEMENT IS FINITO.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.063
WHAT I WAS SAYING IS,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.264
NOW HE'S IN JAIL--

11:37.264 --> 11:38.298

DO SOMETHING WITH HIS MONEY

11:41.168 --> 11:41.835

12:12.599 --> 12:13.333
THE APPRAISALS FOR THAT.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.868
I'LL JUST PAWN THE DAMN RING.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.637
GO AHEAD AND PAWN IT.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.438
UNLESS IT MEANS SOMETHING

12:18.438 --> 12:19.172
TO YOU.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.073
OH, I WILL.

12:20.073 --> 12:20.808
I DEFINITELY WILL.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.809
DON'T GET IT TWISTED.

12:21.809 --> 12:22.810
DONE.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.476
DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU

12:23.476 --> 12:24.144
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SON?

12:24.144 --> 12:24.812
YOU WON.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.813
SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN

12:25.813 --> 12:27.214
KEEPING THE DAMN RING?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.481
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.184
I'LL LEAVE.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.986
THERE WAS A POINT WHEN I THOUGHT

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
THAT ERICA--HMM--

12:34.988 --> 12:36.389
WAS NEAR THE THRONE.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.557
NOW THAT THE ENGAGEMENT

12:37.557 --> 12:39.626
IS FINALLY OVER, ALL THEY CAN DO

12:39.626 --> 12:40.560
IS CO-PARENT.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.162
SO GO AHEAD AND PAWN THE RING,

12:42.162 --> 12:43.230
AND GET THE HELL OUT

12:43.230 --> 12:44.164
OF MY PALACE.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.132
BACK TO THE BARN BEFORE

12:45.132 --> 12:47.367
I CALL THE GUARDS.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.601
DON'T TRIP.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.603
HMM.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.308
LAST WEEK THREW ME

12:55.308 --> 12:56.109
OFF BALANCE.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.710
I WAS A BIT CONFLICTED.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.645
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.147
I'M THROWN OFF BY THIS NEW

13:00.147 --> 13:01.248
SITUATION WITH TRACI

13:01.248 --> 13:02.582
AND THIS DUDE.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.017
IT'S NOT LIKE ME TO LOSE MY COOL

13:04.017 --> 13:05.085
IN PUBLIC AND DECLARE MY LOVE

13:05.085 --> 13:06.186
FOR A WOMAN.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.988
EVEN IF I DO LOVE THEM,

13:07.988 --> 13:09.056
JAMAICAN BAD MAN

13:09.056 --> 13:10.457
DON'T LOSE THEM COOL.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.591
RAH.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.659
I CAME OVER HERE TO APOLOGIZE

13:12.659 --> 13:13.493
TO YOU.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.762
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU WAS ACTING

13:15.762 --> 13:17.264
CRAZY.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.967
YOU WERE TRYING TO KISS ME.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.768
WHERE'S ALL THIS COMIN' FROM?

13:21.768 --> 13:23.636
SO ABOUT THAT...

13:23.636 --> 13:25.205
LIKE, I JUST KNEW

13:25.205 --> 13:25.873
YOU WAS GONNA KISS ME.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.140
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GONNA

13:27.140 --> 13:28.375
PULL BACK.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.042
BECAUSE WHAT?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.177
'CAUSE I WAS ALWAYS THAT GUY.

13:30.177 --> 13:30.878
LIKE, I WAS THERE.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.612
LIKE, I ALREADY KNEW, LIKE--

13:32.612 --> 13:33.280
BUT HOW--

13:33.280 --> 13:34.381
IF I WANTED TO,

13:34.381 --> 13:35.582
I COULD KIND OF.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.084
SO YOU RUN IN THE STREETS

13:37.084 --> 13:37.885
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE,

13:37.885 --> 13:38.718
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "BUT TRACI'S

13:38.718 --> 13:40.253
SITTING HOME FOR ME."

13:40.253 --> 13:40.988
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF--

13:40.988 --> 13:41.889
"WHENEVER I WANT IT."

13:41.889 --> 13:42.890
I JUST THOUGHT IF THAT OPTION

13:42.890 --> 13:44.892
WAS AVAILABLE, OR IF I WANTED

13:44.892 --> 13:45.558
THAT TO BE AN OPTION,

13:45.558 --> 13:46.894
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE AN OPTION,

13:46.894 --> 13:48.561
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I SEEN YOU

13:48.561 --> 13:49.696
WITH--WHAT'S HIS NAME?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.164
SEAN.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.333
I JUST DIDN'T SEE THIS--

13:53.333 --> 13:54.467
I DIDN'T SEE THIS THING

13:54.467 --> 13:55.302
HAPPENING.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.104
WHEN DREW SEES ME AND ONLY

13:57.104 --> 13:58.371
ME, HE'LL ACT LIKE THIS.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.639
BUT NOW THAT HE SEES A NEW DUDE

13:59.639 --> 14:01.374
IN THE PICTURE, HE ACTIN' CRAZY.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.542
WHY ARE YOU JEALOUS?

14:02.542 --> 14:03.977
I HAVE TO SIT BACK AND SEE

14:03.977 --> 14:05.913
A NEW POPCORN CHICK EVERY WEEK.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.380
WHAT, YOU WANT ME, BOO?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.448
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT I HAVE

14:08.448 --> 14:09.116
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

14:09.116 --> 14:09.917
IT'S A SHOCK.

14:09.917 --> 14:10.650
IT'S OUT OF NOWHERE.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.085
IT'S, LIKE, ONE MINUTE,

14:12.085 --> 14:12.920
WE JUST COOL.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.553
IT'S LIKE THERE'S

14:13.553 --> 14:14.654
NO OTHER PERSON--JUST ME, YOU,

14:14.654 --> 14:15.956
AND DREW--AND THE NEXT MINUTE--

14:15.956 --> 14:16.623
ONE MINUTE?

14:16.623 --> 14:17.690
SEVEN YEARS.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.926
THAT'S NOT ONE MINUTE.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.093
YOU LIVE IN A WORLD

14:20.093 --> 14:21.028
OF DOUBLE STANDARDS.

14:21.028 --> 14:21.929
NO, I DON'T. I DON'T.

14:21.929 --> 14:22.695
AND THIS IS BULL[bleep].

14:22.695 --> 14:23.463
YES, YOU DO.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.397
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER

14:24.397 --> 14:25.065
YOU WANT TO DO--

14:25.065 --> 14:26.499
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.600
I CAME OVER HERE TO TELL YOU

14:27.600 --> 14:28.568
THAT I WAS SORRY

14:28.568 --> 14:29.802
FOR HOW I ACTED.

14:29.802 --> 14:30.470
SO I WANT YOU

14:30.470 --> 14:31.171
TO ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.139
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME, "LOOK,

14:32.139 --> 14:33.140
WE CAN START OVER."

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A RELA--

14:35.008 --> 14:36.176
[laughs]

14:36.176 --> 14:39.046
SAY IT!

14:39.046 --> 14:40.013
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE IN

14:40.013 --> 14:41.314
A RELATIONSHIP--

14:41.314 --> 14:43.583
WITH?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.085
SEAN, RIGHT?

14:45.085 --> 14:45.752
THAT'S HIS NAME?

14:45.752 --> 14:46.453
THAT IS HIS NAME.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.120
ALL RIGHT.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.455
SEE, I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING CRAZY.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.523
SO WHAT I'M THINKING IS,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.059
I WANT TO TAKE BOTH OF YOU GUYS

14:52.059 --> 14:55.262
OUT FOR DINNER AND JUST GET

14:55.262 --> 14:56.063
TO KNOW THE GUY.

14:56.063 --> 14:56.829
IF HE'S IN YOUR LIFE,

14:56.829 --> 14:57.965
HE'S GONNA BE IN MY LIFE.

14:57.965 --> 14:58.698
HE'S GONNA BE

14:58.698 --> 14:59.967
IN DREW'S LIFE POSSIBLY.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.701
I NEED TO KNOW.

15:01.701 --> 15:02.535
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO HIM.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.403
SO I WANT TO TAKE YOU BOTH

15:03.403 --> 15:05.472
OUT TO DINNER ON ME, MY TREAT,

15:05.472 --> 15:06.173
AND...

15:06.173 --> 15:07.240
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.241
I WANT TO MEET THIS GUY.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.142
I DON'T CARE IF TRACI THINKS

15:09.142 --> 15:10.043
IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

15:10.043 --> 15:10.710
MATTER OF FACT,

15:10.710 --> 15:11.378
IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.045
SO WHAT?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.646
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SOME

15:13.646 --> 15:15.115
RANDOM DUDE HANGING AROUND

15:15.115 --> 15:17.017
MY KID, FEEDING HIM STEROID

15:17.017 --> 15:17.985
JUICE ON THE SIDE.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.252
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.988
SO IF WE GET A MEAL TOGETHER,

15:20.988 --> 15:22.289
I CAN APOLOGIZE.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.590
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

15:23.590 --> 15:24.724
I CAN SEE IF I TRUST HIM

15:24.724 --> 15:25.692
AROUND MY SON.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.559
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

15:26.559 --> 15:27.394
I WANT TO SEE YOU HAPPY.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.061
[laughs]

15:28.061 --> 15:29.829
SO...

15:29.829 --> 15:30.663
CAN I HAVE A HUG?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.665
NOT WITH THAT--

15:32.665 --> 15:34.567
B--DREWSY--

15:34.567 --> 15:35.235

17:47.700 --> 17:48.401
FOR REAL.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.470
I CAN TELL WHEN ARIANE WALKED IN

17:50.470 --> 17:52.272
THAT SHE WAS OFF HER GAME.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.140
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

17:53.140 --> 17:53.973
SHE LOOKED A LITTLE

17:53.973 --> 17:55.408
FUNNY-LOOKING, AND WHEN SHE

17:55.408 --> 17:56.776
SANG, SHE SOUNDED

17:56.776 --> 17:57.877
JUST LIKE SHE LOOKED.

17:57.877 --> 17:58.878
I'M HAPPY YOU EVEN CAME

17:58.878 --> 18:00.813
BEING SICK.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.282

18:02.282 --> 18:03.616
BEYONCE BE SICK ALL THE TIME,

18:03.616 --> 18:04.484
AND SHE STILL ROLLING

18:04.484 --> 18:05.652
ON THE GROUND IN HER LEOTARD

18:05.652 --> 18:06.319
AND THE KITTEN EARS.

18:06.319 --> 18:06.986
SO I'M CONFUSED.

18:06.986 --> 18:07.654
THAT'S AN EXCUSE?

18:07.654 --> 18:08.921
COME ON, MIKE, LET ME TALK.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.257

18:11.791 --> 18:12.692

18:12.692 --> 18:14.227
BUT HE KNOWS ARIANE'S MY GIRL.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.229
HE TOOK IT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.264
EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T SOUND

18:17.264 --> 18:18.598
HER BEST, I STILL DON'T WANT

18:23.870 --> 18:25.004
OKAY, WAIT--

18:25.004 --> 18:26.606

18:26.606 --> 18:27.274
THIS WAS FOR HER.

18:27.274 --> 18:27.940
IT'S FOR ME.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.409
IT IS FOR YOU, AND YOU

18:29.409 --> 18:30.443
NEED THE BEST OF THE BEST.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.444
'KAY, THANK YOU.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.379
DON'T WORRY.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.513
DON'T--FOR REAL, THOUGH.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.681
THANK YOU.

18:34.681 --> 18:35.382
DON'T YOU GET ME SICK.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.183

18:36.183 --> 18:36.783
I LOVE YOU.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.450
I LOVE YOU TOO.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.185
STOP.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.452
IT'S NOT EVEN--

18:39.452 --> 18:40.387
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.321
IT'S NOT EVEN COOL.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.855
SO WHOEVER THIS FAT [bleep]

18:42.855 --> 18:44.957
WAS WAS A COMPLETE ASS[bleep],

18:44.957 --> 18:46.359
AND I REALLY APPRECIATED K.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.427
FOR BEING AS PROFESSIONAL

18:47.427 --> 18:48.228
AS SHE WAS.

18:48.228 --> 18:48.961
I AUDITIONED.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.197
IT WASN'T A GREAT AUDITION.

18:50.197 --> 18:50.863
DONE.

18:50.863 --> 18:51.798
I'M STILL GONNA KEEP MOVING

18:51.798 --> 18:53.733
WITH MY MUSIC, PERIOD.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.567
AND SHE WANTED TO BE

18:54.567 --> 18:55.702
IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY?

18:55.702 --> 18:56.903
I MEAN, IT'S DEFINITELY--

18:56.903 --> 18:58.070
IT IS SINK OR SWIM,

18:58.070 --> 18:58.738
BUT, YOU KNOW--

18:58.738 --> 18:59.672
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,

18:59.672 --> 19:02.509
AND IT SUNK.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.210
YOU NEED TO GO AHEAD

19:03.210 --> 19:03.976
AND GET THIS CRIB

19:03.976 --> 19:05.245
AND STOP FLEXING.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.112
I WANT IT.

19:06.112 --> 19:06.979
WHAT ABOUT MY COMMITMENT?

19:06.979 --> 19:07.680
I WANT IT.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.381
DON'T LIE TO ME, BABE.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.616
I WANT EVERYTHING.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.117
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.219
SMOKE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER,

19:12.219 --> 19:12.985
BITCH, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT

19:12.985 --> 19:13.720
YOU'RE GONNA GET FROM ME.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.754
DON'T GET IT TWISTED.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.455
[bleep]!

19:15.455 --> 19:17.023
[all yelling]

19:17.023 --> 19:18.425
thud!

19:18.425 --> 19:19.392
YOU GOING TO JAIL!

19:19.392 --> 19:20.727
LET ME GO!

19:20.727 --> 19:22.729
[bleep] THAT BITCH, MAN.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.843
NOT ONLY DID MOMMA DEE

19:36.843 --> 19:39.145
COSIGN ON THE IDEA OF ME PAWNING

19:39.145 --> 19:40.847
THE RING, BUT SHE CALLED ME UP

19:40.847 --> 19:42.415
AND ASKED TO TAG ALONG.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.883
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MANIAC'S

19:43.883 --> 19:44.817
INTENTIONS ARE.

19:44.817 --> 19:45.852
BUT JUST AS LONG

19:45.852 --> 19:46.886
AS SHE DOESN'T START STUFFING

19:46.886 --> 19:48.054
JEWELS IN HER PURSE,

19:48.054 --> 19:49.756
I'M COOL WITH HER COMING ALONG.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.090
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.725
I'M TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN

19:52.725 --> 19:55.662
ACTUALLY SELL BACK THE RING.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.396
OH.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.264
AND I'M TRYING TO SEE

19:57.264 --> 19:58.965
WHAT MY OPTIONS MAY BE,

19:58.965 --> 19:59.799
THE WHAT--YOU KNOW.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.269
OKAY, WELL, ONE OPTION IS,

20:02.269 --> 20:03.202
I CAN ACTUALLY

20:03.202 --> 20:03.903
BUY BACK THE RING.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.571
MM-HMM.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.273
YOU WON'T GET TO GET IT BACK,

20:06.273 --> 20:06.939
THOUGH.

20:06.939 --> 20:07.707
SO IF I BUY IT,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.008
IT'S GONE FOREVER.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.810
BUT ANOTHER OPTION I DO HAVE IS,

20:10.810 --> 20:11.678
DO CONSIGNMENT.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.345
MM.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.113
ON CONSIGNMENT, THERE IS

20:14.113 --> 20:15.482
A CHANCE THAT, YOU KNOW,

20:15.482 --> 20:16.583
IF YOU COME BACK, AND YOU WANT

20:16.583 --> 20:17.684
TO GET IT, AND IT HASN'T BEEN

20:17.684 --> 20:19.852
SOLD, THEN YOU COULD GET

20:19.852 --> 20:20.720
YOUR RING BACK.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.854
I MEAN, 'CAUSE IF YOU SELL IT

20:21.854 --> 20:23.022
TO ME, AND IT'S GONE--

20:23.022 --> 20:24.357
IT'S GONE.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.024
OKAY.

20:25.024 --> 20:25.725
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.393
OKAY.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.527
LET ME DISCUSS IT WITH HER.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.695
SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.263
LET ME KNOW.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.798
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:31.798 --> 20:32.899
IF YOU REALLY MEAN IT,

20:32.899 --> 20:34.233
AND TRUE TO YOURSELF AND TRUE

20:34.233 --> 20:35.935
TO YOUR HEART, SELL IT.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.069
DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO,

20:37.069 --> 20:37.737
AND LET IT DO

20:37.737 --> 20:38.405
WHAT YOU GONNA TO DO.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.006
LET'S SHUT THIS CHAPTER DOWN.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.140
LET'S BE CLEAR.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.642
ERICA DIDN'T DESERVE THE CROWN

20:42.642 --> 20:44.076
JEWELS ANYWAY.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.414
SO GET THAT RING OFF THAT BITCH

20:47.414 --> 20:48.515
HAND.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.782
GET 'EM OFF THAT HAND.

20:49.782 --> 20:50.817
OPEN, OPEN, OPEN,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.051
OPEN, OPEN, OPEN.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.753
I'M THINKING I REALLY JUST

20:53.753 --> 20:55.154
WANT TO SELL IT, JUST BE DONE

20:55.154 --> 20:57.089
WITH IT, JUST, YOU KNOW,

20:57.089 --> 20:57.957
MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE,

20:57.957 --> 20:59.292
GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

20:59.292 --> 20:59.959
OKAY.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.693
BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK

21:00.693 --> 21:02.562
I WOULD GET IT IF I SOLD IT

21:02.562 --> 21:04.797
VERSUS CONSIGNMENT?

21:04.797 --> 21:05.665
YOU'RE GONNA GET RIGHT ABOUT

21:05.665 --> 21:07.867
$10,000 FOR IT.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.669
AND IF I PUT IT ON

21:09.669 --> 21:10.370
CONSIGNMENT...

21:10.370 --> 21:11.338
IN CONSIGNMENT, IT WILL GET

21:11.338 --> 21:14.907
ABOUT $15,000.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.343
I'M GONNA DO THE CONSIGNMENT.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.344
OKAY.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.177
I KNOW PUTTING A RING ON

21:18.177 --> 21:19.546
CONSIGNMENT MAY SEEM LIKE

21:19.546 --> 21:20.513
I'M LEAVING THAT DOOR OPEN

21:20.513 --> 21:21.381
FOR ME AND SCRAPPY TO GET

21:21.381 --> 21:22.248
BACK TOGETHER.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.050
BUT IF AND WHEN HE GETS

21:24.050 --> 21:26.553
OUT OF JAIL, NOT HAPPENING.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.087
I'M ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.

21:28.087 --> 21:28.988
WITH CONSIGNMENT,

21:28.988 --> 21:30.357
THE JEWELRY STORE IS GONNA SELL

21:30.357 --> 21:31.223
THE RING FOR ME

21:31.223 --> 21:32.258
INSTEAD OF ME TRYING TO FIND

21:32.258 --> 21:33.826
A BUYER, AND THAT EXTRA

21:33.826 --> 21:35.962

IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.469
MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL BE BACK.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.370
MAYBE I'LL FIND A MAN

21:43.370 --> 21:44.270
TO PUT A RING ON IT.

21:44.270 --> 21:44.937
WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.

21:44.937 --> 21:45.838

21:45.838 --> 21:46.906

21:56.616 --> 21:57.584
AFTER I LEFT THE STUDIO

21:57.584 --> 21:58.485
FROM TALKING TO STEVIE

21:58.485 --> 22:00.052
THE OTHER DAY, I REALIZE THAT

22:00.052 --> 22:01.120
SOMEBODY HAD TO START MAKING

22:01.120 --> 22:02.755

22:45.832 --> 22:46.499

22:47.166 --> 22:47.834
IN HERE TOO.

22:47.834 --> 22:48.501

BUT JOSELINE MAKING MOVES

22:57.944 --> 22:59.178

AND YOU DON'T DO THIS,

23:26.473 --> 23:27.273
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.

23:27.273 --> 23:28.207
'CAUSE YOUR TIMELINE COULD BE

23:28.207 --> 23:29.041
ANYWHERE FROM

23:29.041 --> 23:30.477
10 YEARS THROUGH 50 YEARS.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.744
I'M GONNA BE AN OLD LADY

23:31.744 --> 23:32.612

23:32.612 --> 23:34.213
GRAY HAIRS ON MY [bleep]--

IT'S NOT FAIR.

23:38.084 --> 23:38.751
HOW MANY DAYS I GOT

23:38.751 --> 23:40.720

23:40.720 --> 23:41.554
NOT THAT LONG.

23:41.554 --> 23:45.057
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME NOW.

EXCUSE ME, Y'ALL.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.063
AM I HAPPY THAT SCRAPPY'S

28:51.063 --> 28:52.598

28:52.598 --> 28:54.934
FOR THE SAKE OF EMANI, YES,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.468
AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.570
BUT ME AND SCRAPPY NEED TO TALK,

28:58.570 --> 28:59.538
'CAUSE HE NEEDS TO HEAR IT FROM

28:59.538 --> 29:01.808
ME--NOT HIS RAGGEDY-ASS MAMA--

29:01.808 --> 29:03.943
THAT I DECIDED TO PAWN THE RING.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.444
WITH YOUR SITUATION AND ALL,

29:05.444 --> 29:06.278
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

29:06.278 --> 29:08.247
THAT I PAWNED THE RING,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.315
THE ENGAGEMENT RING.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.082
YOU SAY WHAT?

29:10.082 --> 29:13.853
I PAWNED THE ENGAGEMENT RING.

29:13.853 --> 29:14.720
YOU WAS LOCKED UP.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.454
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

29:15.454 --> 29:16.856
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE,

29:16.856 --> 29:17.589
DIDN'T KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD

29:17.589 --> 29:19.558
GET OUT, SO I HAD TO MAKE SURE

29:19.558 --> 29:21.260
FINANCIALLY THAT ME AND EMANI

29:21.260 --> 29:22.228
WERE GONNA BE STRAIGHT.

29:22.228 --> 29:26.032
SO YOU PAWNED THE RING?

29:26.032 --> 29:26.732
LIKE, THE RING DON'T MEAN

29:26.732 --> 29:27.399
NOTHING?

29:27.399 --> 29:29.035
I MEAN, LIKE, YOU SAID A LOT

29:29.035 --> 29:29.869
OF STUFF WHEN YOU

29:29.869 --> 29:30.903
PROPOSED TO ME.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.271
YOU CAN'T TAKE THREE STEPS

29:32.271 --> 29:33.505
FORWARD AND THEN PRETEND TO TAKE

29:33.505 --> 29:35.641
THOSE OR FOUR STEPS BACKWARDS.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.508
THAT'S NOT PROGRESSING

29:36.508 --> 29:37.543
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.410
I AIN'T GONNA EVEN LIE,

29:38.410 --> 29:39.278
IT HURT.

29:39.278 --> 29:39.979
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

29:39.979 --> 29:41.848
IT HURT, 'CAUSE YOU PAWN TVs.

29:41.848 --> 29:42.714
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

29:42.714 --> 29:44.616
YOU PAWN STUFF THAT YOU CAN GET

29:52.658 --> 29:53.893
KEEPING A RING OR HOLDING ON TO

33:44.523 --> 33:46.525
LAST NIGHT, YOU KNOW, I WAS AT

33:46.525 --> 33:47.793
MY PRETTY GIRLS ROCK EVENT,

33:47.793 --> 33:50.496

SAYING HOW THEY WENT TO THE

33:59.338 --> 34:02.308
LAKE, AND THEY WAS TURNED UP.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.676
THESE [bleep] WAS REALLY ACTING

34:04.676 --> 34:05.977
LIKE, "WE WAS ON TEN.

"[bleep],

34:10.982 --> 34:11.717
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE."

34:11.717 --> 34:14.120
THEN HOMEGIRL WAS SAYING,

34:14.120 --> 34:16.422
"WELL, HE HAS A PASS, THOUGH,

34:16.422 --> 34:17.256

34:17.256 --> 34:18.023
REALLY?

34:18.023 --> 34:19.191
IS THAT WHAT HE REALLY THINKS

34:19.191 --> 34:19.858
IN A MARRIAGE?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.360
SO HE TOOK THAT

34:21.360 --> 34:22.261
AND RAN WITH IT.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.395
BUT YOU DON'T TAKE THAT AND

34:23.395 --> 34:24.596
RUN WITH IT AS A MARRIED MAN.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.697
YOU GO SOMEWHERE, AND YOU GET

34:25.697 --> 34:26.598
SOME [bleep] SENSE ABOUT

34:26.598 --> 34:27.399

34:27.399 --> 34:28.567
YOU DON'T GO MESSIN' WITH

34:28.567 --> 34:31.203
RATCHET HOS OFF THE CORNER.

BUT I GOT TO BE HONEST WITH

34:32.271 --> 34:32.938

34:32.938 --> 34:34.806

34:37.309 --> 34:38.477
ALL I KNOW IS WHAT THEY TOLD

34:38.477 --> 34:39.378

34:39.378 --> 34:41.180
BUT IT DON'T EVEN MATTER,

34:41.180 --> 34:42.381

"WE TURNED UP,"

34:44.650 --> 34:47.153
THEY WAS TURNED UP.

34:47.153 --> 34:48.154
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

34:48.154 --> 34:49.188
YOUR MARRIED ASS DON'T NEED

34:49.188 --> 34:50.589
TO BE TURNED NOWHERE.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.881

YOU REALLY THINK

36:50.509 --> 36:51.176
THAT'S SMART?

WHY WOULD SAY, "GO ABOUT YOUR

36:53.645 --> 36:54.680

36:54.680 --> 36:55.481
BECAUSE, KIRK,

36:55.481 --> 36:56.515
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

36:56.515 --> 36:57.182
I'M SAYING--

36:57.182 --> 36:57.849
WHY WOULD YOU SAY IT?

36:57.849 --> 36:58.550

TO YOU?

36:59.285 --> 36:59.985
WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO?

36:59.985 --> 37:01.287
SO WHY WOULD IT BE A PROBLEM?

37:01.287 --> 37:02.821
I HATE YOU RIGHT NOW.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.823
WHY YOU GOT TO HATE ME?

37:08.594 --> 37:09.528

37:10.962 --> 37:11.630

37:11.630 --> 37:12.698
YOU DON'T DO THAT TO ME.

37:12.698 --> 37:13.365
SO WHAT?

37:13.365 --> 37:14.900

37:14.900 --> 37:16.067
I KNOW I AIN'T ALWAYS BEEN

37:16.067 --> 37:18.304
PERFECT, KIRK, BUT I WOULD NEVER

37:18.304 --> 37:19.471
EVER DO THAT.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.472
AND ONE THING I AM IS,

37:20.472 --> 37:21.807
I'M 100% COMMITTED

37:21.807 --> 37:22.574
TO THIS MARRIAGE,

37:22.574 --> 37:23.675
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I AM.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.677
WHEN I TOLD KIRK TO GO "DO YOU,"

37:25.677 --> 37:26.978
THAT MEANT, "GO OUT THERE AND

37:26.978 --> 37:28.514
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

37:28.514 --> 37:29.648
ON WITH YOURSELF."

37:29.648 --> 37:31.149
I DIDN'T GIVE HIM NO FREE PASS

37:31.149 --> 37:33.018
TO RUN OUT HERE AND BE A HO,

37:33.018 --> 37:33.685
AND IF THAT'S

37:33.685 --> 37:34.453
WHAT YOU WAS THINKING,

37:34.453 --> 37:36.187
THEN, DAMN THAT [bleep].

37:36.187 --> 37:37.323
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LAKE?

37:37.323 --> 37:38.824

37:38.824 --> 37:39.958
BECAUSE I AIN'T EVEN SEEN YOU

37:39.958 --> 37:41.026
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.328
SO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

37:42.328 --> 37:43.228
ALL THIS [bleep] SOUNDS [bleep]

37:43.228 --> 37:44.029

38:08.587 --> 38:11.423
WORTH EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE,

38:11.423 --> 38:12.824
EVERYTHING THAT WE DONE DID,

38:12.824 --> 38:14.159
ALL THESE YEARS,

38:14.159 --> 38:15.661
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON?

38:15.661 --> 38:16.895

38:37.416 --> 38:38.950
HOW AM I GONNA RELAX, KIRK?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.386
DON'T EVEN TOUCH ME.
