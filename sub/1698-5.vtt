00:07.610 --> 00:09.670
Dad's going to love the
new hairdryer I got him.

00:09.740 --> 00:14.080
Three temperatures, four speeds, and extra
long cord for that hard to reach back hair.

00:15.020 --> 00:17.270
Your Dad blow dries his back hair?

00:17.630 --> 00:19.250
My mornings are not pretty.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.900
- Oh and
- did I mention it comes with a free comb?- Cool.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.520
What are you getting Jackson?

00:24.680 --> 00:25.670
I was thinking a comb.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.340
- Hey, who's the hottie with Oliver ...
- Dibs!

00:31.350 --> 00:31.910
Wait!

00:33.040 --> 00:34.980
That's not fair!
You know the rules.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.670
No buzzing until I
complete a question!

00:36.780 --> 00:39.240
Sorry honey. But when they're
cute there are no rules.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.400
Hey, now you can't
give it to Jackson.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.660
Sure I can!

00:45.770 --> 00:48.950
Hey! Oliver, how you doing?
Get some Christmas shopping done?

00:48.980 --> 00:50.950
- You know, I actually got my Mom -
--- Yeah,She'll love it.

00:51.220 --> 00:51.960
You are?

00:52.160 --> 00:55.840
Extremely happy I didn't order
this with onions. I'm Connor.

00:55.910 --> 00:56.610
I'm Miley.

00:56.710 --> 00:58.400
I'm Lily, but she buzzed in early.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.050
- Again?
- Tell me about it.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.560
So, ar, who you shopping for?

01:03.560 --> 01:06.540
Your mom... your dad...
your... girlfriend?

01:06.960 --> 01:10.650
No, I'm just grabbing a bite before work.
I have a part time job here at the mall.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.520
Oh cool! But if you were shopping for
your mom, your dad and your girlfriend

01:13.520 --> 01:15.820
and you already got your mum and dad
something would you still be shopping?

01:16.900 --> 01:21.150
It depends. Anything in this
mall you might be interested in?

01:21.460 --> 01:22.970
I've got my eye on something.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.140
Ar, excuse me, I'm just going to
head over to Bed, Bath and Barfbag!

01:27.550 --> 01:28.720
Hey guys!

01:28.860 --> 01:29.710
Hey Sofie.

01:30.110 --> 01:35.280
Hey Oliver. Um, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go catch a movie tonight?

01:35.460 --> 01:39.850
Ar, sorry Sofie,
I'm going out of town. Tonight.

01:40.930 --> 01:47.160
Yeah, I'm doing some roady work for this
cool new band - ar... Restrooms this way.

01:48.530 --> 01:51.090
Oh, OK, well maybe next time?

01:51.500 --> 01:54.440
Sure. Will do that.
We'll go next time.

01:56.220 --> 02:00.430
The restrooms this way? Who's there
opening act, the "place trays here"?

02:01.100 --> 02:04.310
OK, Lily, I can't go out with her.
I mean, she's cute, but

02:04.800 --> 02:07.030
did you see the size of her feet?

02:08.080 --> 02:12.360
You are turning her down because of one,
little physical thing?

02:12.500 --> 02:16.420
Little? Miley, Big Foot called her last
week to borrow a pair of her slippers!

02:16.540 --> 02:17.570
Oh!

02:18.020 --> 02:19.200
Oh.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.930
Dude, I'm with Miley on
this one. That's cold.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.100
Yeah! And you're being
totally shallow.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.260
Besides, she was kind of cute.

02:28.490 --> 02:31.740
Cute, she wasn't cute!
Did you see the size of her feet?

02:33.530 --> 02:35.140
You know... you're funny.

02:36.510 --> 02:39.670
Yeah. That's what I was going for.

02:40.780 --> 02:44.140
Hey, Miley, would you want to go to
the holiday carnival with me tonight?

02:44.160 --> 02:44.850
I'd love to.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.320
So I'll meet you there?

02:46.450 --> 02:48.320
Yeah... I will.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.420
See! I'm going to the carnival
with someone totally nice.

02:52.510 --> 02:55.110
Something you would be doing
if you weren't so judgmental!

02:55.150 --> 02:57.610
Yeah face it Oliver,
Miley's just the bigger person.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.690
Later guys.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.620
Sweet Niblets! I got a
date with a Sweet Niblet!

04:03.270 --> 04:05.810
- Well, well, well.
- Don't!

04:06.640 --> 04:11.550
Now Miley, there's no reason
to be 'short-tempered'.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.510
Oliver. Cut it out! Sure she was
surprised, but she's not gonna'

04:16.620 --> 04:21.370
What I'm saying is, she can rise above...
You try it, it's harder than you think!

04:21.880 --> 04:24.120
I was a little caught off guard.

04:25.610 --> 04:31.910
See I, unlike you, can pass the
difference in our... various altitudes.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.960
Various altitudes? Miley,
come on, face it.

04:36.110 --> 04:40.130
You're as shallow as I am.
But the diffrence is, I admit it.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.890
For instance

04:43.600 --> 04:45.220
weird headline

04:46.510 --> 04:48.050
too many freckles!

04:48.520 --> 04:51.320
Oh, here we go, hey Baby,
how you doing?

04:52.740 --> 04:54.230
Back off, helmet hair.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.570
Shallow! and I respect that.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.570
Well I don't. Me and Connor are going
to have a great time tonight because...

05:03.580 --> 05:05.080
Good things come in small packages?

05:06.500 --> 05:09.160
OK, look, I'm sorry,
it's a bad hobit... habit!

05:09.300 --> 05:10.470
That one was an accident.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.910
Hmm... got a little bit
of a tilt there, buddy.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.260
Oh

05:29.260 --> 05:30.690
Oh, dang flab it!

05:37.150 --> 05:39.230
There. Straight as an arrow.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.360
Dad, hey Dad!

05:49.650 --> 05:50.950
Cut the tree too short again?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.370
No! Don't be silly.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.620
Just soaring up some firewood,
that's all.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.350
We don't have a fireplace.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.420
It's always the negative
with you, isn't it!

06:04.340 --> 06:08.690
Well not today! Because I just got
back from the college of my dreams!

06:08.820 --> 06:11.500
State University of Santa Barbra!

06:11.670 --> 06:16.120
Amazing beaches, beautiful babes
and a party on every block.

06:16.190 --> 06:17.690
- How are the classes?
- The what?

06:19.140 --> 06:21.760
The classes. You did look
into the classes, right?

06:23.010 --> 06:25.080
Oh yeah... lots of them.

06:25.880 --> 06:30.700
They all had big blackboards and other...
educational learning stuff.

06:31.610 --> 06:36.440
Jackson. Santa Barbra's a great school son,
but it's not all that easy to get into.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.700
I know, but I've got
it all figured out.

06:38.710 --> 06:43.020
See, I may not have the greatest grades,
but I only need one thing to get myself through the door.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.250
Harry Potter's cloak
of invisibility?

06:45.690 --> 06:48.370
Harry Potter's cloak
of invisibility? No!

06:49.620 --> 06:51.630
A letter of reccommendation.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.040
Son, I don't want to be the mouldy
cheese in your refrigerator of hope...

06:55.340 --> 06:57.540
but, where are you going to find
somebody to write you that letter?

06:58.460 --> 07:03.700
Right there. Right next to where it says
Major Contribution made by Influential .

07:05.150 --> 07:06.840
That looks just like...

07:08.970 --> 07:10.780
Not bad, Stewart.

07:10.850 --> 07:15.250
But you're going to have to do a lot more
than this if you want to get a letter of reccomendation out of me.

07:15.820 --> 07:20.270
Yes Mr. Dontzig... very good Mr.
Dontzig... anything you say... Mr. Dontzig!

07:20.870 --> 07:25.000

19:55.290 --> 19:58.800

to get dumber in the college

19:58.890 --> 20:04.810

brilliant,but he's smart enough to get into college without your help!

20:05.080 --> 20:06.390

20:06.610 --> 20:07.770

21:23.620 --> 21:25.440
come on hold on everybody

21:25.650 --> 21:27.610
christmas ain't about the gifts

the little special moments that make up everyday life

21:35.740 --> 21:38.690
that's beautiful daddy,
merry christmas

21:39.400 --> 21:40.880

that your mother always did the shop

21:48.580 --> 21:51.930

up this fantastic tree!
