00:06.083 --> 00:08.958
[Galadriel]  My brother gave his life
hunting Sauron.

00:09.083 --> 00:10.833
His task is now mine.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.791
[Thondir]  Commander Galadriel.

00:13.916 --> 00:17.375
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.000
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

00:21.125 --> 00:24.458
[Galadriel]  This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

00:24.833 --> 00:26.208
The question now is, where?

00:26.291 --> 00:27.166
The evil is gone.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.708
Then why is it not gone from in here?

00:29.791 --> 00:33.375
[Gil-galad]  These heroes shall be granted
a passage across the sea

00:33.416 --> 00:35.166
to dwell for all eternity.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.416
[Elrond]  You have fought
long enough, Galadriel.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.541
[whooshing]

00:38.625 --> 00:39.625
Put up your sword.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.416
[Galadriel]  Without it, what am I to be?

00:43.791 --> 00:44.666
[whooshing]

00:45.125 --> 00:48.833
Are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.250
[Elrond]  The greatest
of Elven-smiths, of course.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.291
What's one of them doing here?

00:56.041 --> 00:58.041
She's got some sort of a sickness.

00:58.166 --> 01:01.458
-Where has she been grazing?
-She wandered east a few days ago.

01:01.541 --> 01:02.375
How far east?

01:02.666 --> 01:03.500
[Bronwyn] Hordern.

01:05.625 --> 01:07.583
[voices whispering in Black Speech]

01:08.000 --> 01:10.791
[Nori]  Haven't you ever wondered
what else is out there?

01:10.916 --> 01:12.166
Beyond our wanderin'.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.833
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

01:15.791 --> 01:18.458
-[Sadoc]  The skies are strange.
-[whooshing]

01:18.625 --> 01:20.000
[explosion]

01:26.625 --> 01:28.625
[theme music playing]

02:59.416 --> 03:01.666
[breathing echoing]

03:23.541 --> 03:25.250
[panting]

03:36.666 --> 03:39.666
[crackling]

03:56.208 --> 03:58.458
-Nori!
-[gasps] Poppy!

03:58.541 --> 04:01.166
Have the wheels come off your cart?
Get away from there!

04:01.250 --> 04:02.291
Shh!

04:02.541 --> 04:04.666
You shouldn't sneak up on folk like that.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.000
-Well, you shouldn't be here.
-Shh!

04:06.083 --> 04:07.541
[both gasping, exclaiming]

04:11.958 --> 04:13.125
[whispering] It's not hot.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.583
[Poppy whispering] Fine. It's not hot.

04:14.666 --> 04:17.875
Doesn't change the fact
that there's a giant in there.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.708
She's making that face.
Not that face, Nori...

04:23.625 --> 04:24.458
Nori!

04:25.958 --> 04:26.791
Nori, don't!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.708
[Nori gasping]

04:37.250 --> 04:39.333
[panting]

04:43.458 --> 04:46.458
Nori, don't! He's dead! Come on!

04:48.541 --> 04:49.500
[screaming]

04:49.583 --> 04:53.583
-No! Don't! Don't! Please!
-[indistinct shouting echoing]

05:00.833 --> 05:01.666
[gasps]

05:01.750 --> 05:05.250
[whooshing]

05:06.583 --> 05:07.708
No!

05:15.458 --> 05:19.458
[wind whistling]

05:21.500 --> 05:25.333
[whooshing]

05:26.083 --> 05:27.083
What...

05:28.583 --> 05:30.666
[gasping]

05:36.083 --> 05:37.041
[gasps]

05:37.125 --> 05:38.458
Your mam's gonna kill ya.

05:40.375 --> 05:44.541
You're not telling her.
Neither am I. Quick sticks.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.041
We can't leave him like this
or the wolves will get him.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.916
-So?
-So, that's not who we are.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.291
That's not who you are.

05:50.375 --> 05:53.625
I can't carry him alone.
Are you gonna help me or not?

05:53.708 --> 05:54.958
-Not.
-Poppy!

05:55.708 --> 05:58.333
How exactly are we supposed
to carry a giant?

05:59.916 --> 06:01.666
[whispering] Must've been a star fall.

06:03.958 --> 06:05.666
A big one.

06:05.750 --> 06:08.166
How many signs do you need?

06:09.083 --> 06:11.958
Ask me, we ought to break camp
this moment.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.541
-[sighs]
-What about the festival?

06:13.625 --> 06:15.833
Let's not do anything rash just yet.

06:15.916 --> 06:18.916
More'n likely we're safer in camp
than we are out.

06:19.541 --> 06:21.541
But keep an eye out, the both of you.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.333
-Malva's right.
-Yes.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.125
This does not bode well.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.041
Now, away with you. Go on.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.333
[snaps fingers] Pssk!

06:29.416 --> 06:32.333
-All right, all right, all right.
-Go on. Hurry up.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.791
[rustling]

06:42.583 --> 06:44.458
-[rustling]
-[gasping]

06:47.291 --> 06:49.000
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

06:52.458 --> 06:54.458
Look at him. He's bleeding massive.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.833
-He's got to be...
-He's not a troll!

06:56.916 --> 06:59.250
All right, smart-foot. Then what is he?

06:59.333 --> 07:02.166
Uh, maybe he's big folk.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.666
Human?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.666
[scoffs] No way. He'd be squished.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.000
Elf, maybe?

07:07.500 --> 07:10.208
-Wrong ears. And he's not handsome.
-[laughs]

07:10.291 --> 07:12.916
Not to mention,
Elves don't fall from the sky.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.791
Nobody does. As far as I know.

07:14.875 --> 07:15.875
He did.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.708
-Are you even pullin'?
-Yeah, of course I'm pullin'!

07:18.791 --> 07:20.708
-Well, pull harder!
-Shh!

07:21.916 --> 07:24.458
This is ludicrous.
He's never gonna fit in that old cart.

07:24.541 --> 07:25.958
It's just for one night.

07:26.041 --> 07:29.916
In the mornin', we'll pack him up
some food and send him on his way.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.375
-What way?
-That's a tomorrow problem.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.166
-This isn't an adventure.
-What's that supposed to mean?

07:35.250 --> 07:37.958
-I didn't go looking for this.
-But you're not turning away.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.541
-Because I can't.
-Because you won't.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.458
This stranger isn't a Man, or an Elf,

07:43.541 --> 07:45.500
or some baby eagle with a broken wing.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.500
-That was one time.
-He's something else.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.500
[thuds]

07:48.583 --> 07:50.250
[both panting]

07:51.125 --> 07:52.791
[sighs] Maybe he's something dangerous.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.083
Now you sound
just like Malva and the sisters.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.291
Oh, it's not just them.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.833
Anybody finds out
that we helped a stranger,

07:58.916 --> 08:01.708
and anything bad that happens
the next three seasons

08:01.791 --> 08:03.083
will be our fault.

08:03.166 --> 08:06.458
If a fog lasts a little too long,
a wheel gets stuck in a rut...

08:06.875 --> 08:08.416
Oh, great goats!

08:08.500 --> 08:09.750
[Poppy] Faster, before it crashes!

08:09.833 --> 08:11.375
[Nori] Oh, so now you care about him.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.958
[Poppy] No, no!
The wheelbarrow, it's not mine!

08:14.041 --> 08:16.541
[crickets chirping]

08:25.916 --> 08:28.083
-[laughs]
-[The Stranger mumbles]

08:42.833 --> 08:44.666
[snoring]

09:01.208 --> 09:02.708
Why you doing this, Nori?

09:03.958 --> 09:06.375
-I feel like he's my responsibility.
-You feel like everyone

09:06.458 --> 09:08.291
-is your responsibility.
-No.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.625
This is different.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.750
He could've landed anywhere,
and he landed here.

09:21.041 --> 09:25.875
I know it sounds strange,
but somehow I just know he's important.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.833
It's like there's a reason this happened.

09:29.916 --> 09:32.625
Like I was supposed to find him. Me.

09:34.125 --> 09:37.625
I can't walk away from that.
Not till I know he's safe.

09:40.541 --> 09:41.583
Can you?

09:44.666 --> 09:46.250
Fine. I won't tell anyone.

09:48.625 --> 09:49.875
Thank you.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.750
[Poppy] What does a giant eat, anyway?

09:55.833 --> 09:57.791
Hope it's not Harfoots.

09:57.875 --> 10:00.375
[Nori] Just the ones
that can't keep a secret.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.541
[crickets chirping]

10:03.666 --> 10:06.083
[fire crackling]

10:08.750 --> 10:11.708
[creaking]

10:29.000 --> 10:31.416
[Bronwyn]
The earth is riven with fissures.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.166
Like in a ground-shake.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.500
[Arondir] No bodies.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.583
No wounded.

10:40.666 --> 10:42.083
Perhaps they all fled.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.000
[flies buzzing]

10:43.083 --> 10:44.250
[Arondir] Perhaps.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.500
[latch opening]

10:59.375 --> 11:00.791
This was Ciaran's home.

11:01.458 --> 11:05.500
And... Hana. His wife was Hana.

11:08.958 --> 11:12.291
This was no ground-shake.
Someone dug this passage.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.541
Something.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.750
Men did not do this.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.208
Go. Warn your people.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.166
You're not coming with me?

11:20.250 --> 11:21.916
I must follow the passage.
The other direction.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.833
-You don't know what's down there.
-That is the reason I must go.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.000
[sighs]

11:41.833 --> 11:43.333
[wind whistling]

12:03.208 --> 12:05.541
[birds chirping]

12:05.625 --> 12:06.958
[Elrond] FÃ«anor's hammer.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.666
The tool that wrought the Silmarils.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.500
The jewels that contain
the very light of Valinor.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.666
Strange, isn't it?

12:19.500 --> 12:23.333
How one object could be responsible
for creating so much beauty...

12:24.416 --> 12:25.666
And so much pain.

12:26.250 --> 12:29.375
True creation requires sacrifice.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.750
They say that Morgoth
found the Silmarils so beautiful

12:37.083 --> 12:39.083
that after he'd stolen them, for weeks,

12:39.166 --> 12:41.875
he could do nothing
but stare into their depths.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.041
Hmm.

12:43.125 --> 12:46.333
It was only after one of his tears
fell upon the jewels

12:46.416 --> 12:49.291
and he was faced with the evil
of his own reflection,

12:49.375 --> 12:51.541
that the reverie was finally broken.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.166
From that moment, he...

12:55.250 --> 12:57.416
He looked upon their light no more.

12:58.416 --> 12:59.416
[sighs]

13:00.500 --> 13:04.666
FÃ«anor's work nearly turned the heart
of the Great Foe himself. [laughs]

13:06.791 --> 13:08.708
What has mine ever accomplished?

13:09.625 --> 13:12.125
I... It has turned my heart, my lord.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.791
The heart of many an Elf.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.791
But I aspire to do far more than that.

13:18.666 --> 13:21.250
An Age ago, our kind brought war
to these shores.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.958
I want to fill them with beauty.

13:23.041 --> 13:27.708
To grow beyond petty works of jewel-craft,
and devise something of real power.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.250
What is it you hope to craft?

13:30.333 --> 13:33.750
"What" is but a glint on the far horizon.

13:33.833 --> 13:39.250
You have come to Eregion
to help me achieve the "how."

13:40.333 --> 13:41.500
A tower?

13:42.250 --> 13:47.416
[Celebrimbor] One that can host a forge
more powerful than any ever built.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.583
Able to birth a flame as hot
as a dragon's tongue,

13:50.666 --> 13:52.166
and as pure as starlight.

13:52.250 --> 13:56.083
The things we could use it to create
could transform Middle-earth.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.958
What seems to be the difficulty?

13:58.916 --> 14:00.916
I need it completed by spring.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.250
My lord, that would require a...

14:04.333 --> 14:06.625
A workforce greater
than any ever assembled.

14:06.708 --> 14:09.500
Yes. The High King cannot provide one.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.000
So he has sent me you instead.

14:15.625 --> 14:19.958
Have you considered seeking partners
outside the confines of our own race?

14:20.666 --> 14:22.166
How far outside?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
[wind whooshing]

14:44.250 --> 14:46.458
[Celebrimbor]
An alliance with the Dwarves would be

14:46.541 --> 14:48.500
the diplomatic achievement of the age.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.583
[Elrond] Their prince, Durin,
is an old and dear friend.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.166
Almost like a brother to me.

14:53.250 --> 14:57.333
[Celebrimbor] I've heard the Dwarves
have greatly expanded their halls of late.

14:57.666 --> 15:00.250
They... They sculpt the rock

15:01.291 --> 15:05.333
with the respect of one
who cares for an aged parent.

15:05.416 --> 15:08.083
I've long wanted to see them work.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.083
I had no idea you admired them so.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.791
I admire all who can see
into the mystery of things,

15:12.875 --> 15:15.541
who can divine
from the plainness of what is,

15:15.625 --> 15:17.416
the beauty of what could be...

15:18.583 --> 15:21.666
Might your friend be able to grant me
access to their workshops?

15:21.750 --> 15:24.625
[Elrond] Oh, if I know Durin,
he'll do far more than that.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.375
He'll welcome us with open arms,

15:27.458 --> 15:29.291
rams' horns blaring,

15:29.416 --> 15:31.250
tables filled with salted pork,

15:31.333 --> 15:34.000
-and enough malt beer to fill the Anduin.
-[scraping]

15:34.083 --> 15:35.625
[Dwarf] What do you want?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.208
It is Elrond of Lindon,

15:38.291 --> 15:40.875
accompanied by Celebrimbor,
Lord of Eregion.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.583
We seek an audience with Prince Durin.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.625
-[Dwarf] No.
-[scraping]

15:51.791 --> 15:52.958
My apologies.

15:54.166 --> 15:57.041
Inform Lord Durin
that his friend, Elrond...

15:57.125 --> 15:59.708
[Dwarf] His judgment
has already been rendered, Elf.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.791
Rams' horns?

16:19.041 --> 16:20.500
All right, then, my friend.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.625
I invoke the Rite of  Sigin-tarÃ¢g.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.250
What is the Rite of...

Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

16:42.333 --> 16:44.458
Lord Celebrimbor, trust me.

16:44.541 --> 16:47.333
You are master of your craft, my friend.

Okay.

21:33.541 --> 21:36.416
[breathing heavily]

21:36.500 --> 21:37.833
How 'bout this then...

21:38.375 --> 21:39.958
I won't harm you.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.916
You won't harm me. Deal?

21:51.708 --> 21:53.875
Well, that's a start then, isn't it?

21:53.958 --> 21:56.250
Now, proper things first.
Father always says,

21:56.333 --> 22:00.750
"A Harfoot without manners is as like to
get far in life as a square wheel." So...

22:01.833 --> 22:03.250
I'm Nori.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.458
I'm Nori.

22:10.916 --> 22:13.333
[mumbling] I...

22:14.416 --> 22:15.583
No, I'm Nori.

22:15.666 --> 22:17.416
[mumbles] No, I'm Nori.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.041
What about your name? You?

22:23.458 --> 22:25.083
You don't remember, do you?

22:26.875 --> 22:28.666
Suppose you did fall quite a long way.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.958
Anybody's head would be
a bit higgledy-piggledy.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.375
I fell out of a tree once.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.375
For a whole week,
I kept calling strawberries "pigberries."

22:35.458 --> 22:37.541
Can you imagine? A pigberry?

22:40.708 --> 22:41.833
It's food.

[grunts]

22:43.500 --> 22:46.041
They do eat where you're from, don't they?

22:46.125 --> 22:48.625
Of course they do, Nori,
what a silly question.

-[lively chatter, laughter]

23:36.666 --> 23:38.666
Leave him, Malva. Why don't you help?

23:38.750 --> 23:41.333
I am helping by asking him to help.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.625
Aw, stop your lounge-a-daising
and lend us a foot.

23:44.708 --> 23:48.166
Well, I think Nori was looking forward
to helping out with that.

Where is it you're from, anyway?

23:57.666 --> 24:00.125
Where do you belong?
Where are all the others?

24:00.208 --> 24:02.041
You know, of your kind? Like you?

24:04.750 --> 24:06.166
Are there any others?

Durin! Durin! Durin!

33:39.375 --> 33:45.000
Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin!

33:45.416 --> 33:47.208
A dog may bark at the moon.

33:49.083 --> 33:50.875
But he cannot bring it down.

33:52.416 --> 33:53.750
Take your leave.

33:55.875 --> 33:58.708
Perhaps His Lordship would be willing
to escort me to the exit?

34:01.958 --> 34:03.125
Gladly.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.916
[lift clicking, creaking]

34:15.083 --> 34:18.958
Remarkable. I never dreamed
to find your city so changed.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.041
Now, 20 years will do that.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.625
Has it been only 20?

34:26.208 --> 34:28.458
You must tell me your secret.

34:30.791 --> 34:32.375
Our secrets are our own.

34:33.041 --> 34:34.125
Durin, have I offended you?

34:34.208 --> 34:36.250
To answer that, we'd need a longer lift.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.541
If you wish to discharge me
without explanation,

34:38.625 --> 34:41.041
-that is your choice.
-You bet your feathery shirts it is.

34:41.125 --> 34:43.333
But before squandering
the best opportunity

34:43.416 --> 34:45.500
any Dwarf-prince has had in a generation,

34:45.583 --> 34:47.833
you might at least listen
to the proposal I bring.

34:47.916 --> 34:49.000
Ah, there it is.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.250
The true purpose of your visit.
You want something.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.750
I journeyed here to see my friend,
whom I've greatly missed.

34:53.833 --> 34:56.291
Missed? You missed my wedding.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.375
The birth of my children, two of them!

35:01.250 --> 35:05.583
You cannot barge into my mountain
and demand I welcome you with open arms.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.916
You cannot claim that which you discarded.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.291
Discarded? Durin, I...

35:10.375 --> 35:13.458
Twenty years might be
the blink of an eye to an Elf.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.833
But I've lived an entire life
in that time.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.375
A life you missed.

35:24.916 --> 35:25.875
[grumbles]

35:28.458 --> 35:29.708
[thuds]

35:30.458 --> 35:31.708
[Prince Durin scoffs]

35:33.208 --> 35:35.458
So, what do you have to say to that...

35:37.500 --> 35:38.625
"Friend?"

35:44.208 --> 35:45.416
Congratulations.

35:47.541 --> 35:50.333
On your wife, your children.

35:52.666 --> 35:54.666
I hope you can come to forgive me.

35:57.041 --> 36:01.083
And I would like very much
to apologize to your family as well.

36:04.875 --> 36:05.916
Hmm.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.583
One apology to Disa and you're off.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.666
No getting better acquainted.

36:10.750 --> 36:15.458
No reminiscing about the past.
And absolutely no staying for dinner.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.000
Understood.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.500
[Disa] AulÃ«'s beard! No!

36:19.583 --> 36:21.375
This cannot be Elrond, can it?

36:21.458 --> 36:24.708
I fear so, fair lady.

36:26.291 --> 36:28.416
[exclaiming heartily]

36:30.208 --> 36:31.250
[grumbles]

36:31.333 --> 36:33.583
Durin didn't tell me you were coming.

36:33.666 --> 36:34.958
Durin didn't know.

36:35.041 --> 36:38.291
I've been remiss in not visiting sooner.

36:38.375 --> 36:41.666
An oversight, for which I am here
to humbly ask forgiveness.

36:41.750 --> 36:44.041
-You're staying for dinner.
-He's leaving.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.708
-He's staying.
-He's leaving!

36:45.791 --> 36:46.708
[sternly] He's staying.

36:46.833 --> 36:49.166
-[children laughing]
-[Disa laughs]

36:49.333 --> 36:53.500
Hey! I told you two
to stay out of my heads!

36:53.583 --> 36:57.041
[Disa] And I told you wee monsters
to stay in bed.

36:57.125 --> 36:57.958
Oh, come on!

36:58.208 --> 37:01.458
Gerda! Gamli! Come on, hurry along.

37:01.541 --> 37:02.416
[Gerda] Ow!

37:02.500 --> 37:04.791
Make yourself comfortable, please.

37:05.541 --> 37:07.000
But not too comfortable.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.208
[Disa] Gamli, please.

37:09.291 --> 37:12.083
[Prince Durin] It's off to the salt mines
the both of ya!

37:12.166 --> 37:15.166
Cave-trolls and stalagmite spiders galore!

37:15.250 --> 37:16.666
[Disa and Prince Durin laughing]

37:25.333 --> 37:27.666
[Elrond] How did you two
first become acquainted?

37:28.166 --> 37:31.250
I was resonating a freshly-opened chamber,

37:31.333 --> 37:34.625
fairly confident we were
onto a sizable silver deposit...

37:34.708 --> 37:37.208
"Resonating?"
I've not heard of resonating.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.291
It's when we sing to the stone.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.708
You see, a mountain's like a person.

37:41.791 --> 37:46.208
It's a long and ever-changing story
made of countless small parts.

37:46.291 --> 37:48.958
-Earth and ore, air and water.
-[slurping loudly]

37:49.041 --> 37:53.750
Sing to it properly, each of those parts
will reflect your song back to you,

37:53.833 --> 37:57.166
telling you its story,
showing you what might be hidden,

37:57.250 --> 37:59.708
where to mine, where to tunnel, and...

37:59.791 --> 38:02.333
And where to leave the mountain untouched.

38:02.416 --> 38:04.250
It is a beautiful tradition.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.208
[burps and sighs]

38:07.916 --> 38:12.375
Anyway, we're unpacking our tools,
and my team suddenly grows quiet.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.750
Then, I see our prince.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.666
He's come to check on us.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.791
Far below his purview, mind you.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.083
First, I thought it merely curious.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.083
That is, until he showed up
at our next survey.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.291
[chuckles]

38:25.375 --> 38:29.458
And the one after that.
And the one after that.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.416
Always did have a talent for lurking.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.875
[laughs] Took weeks before he worked up
the courage to court me proper.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.833
Two weeks at most.

38:36.916 --> 38:39.041
-It was five.
-[Prince Durin] You're lying.

38:39.125 --> 38:40.333
She's lying.

38:40.416 --> 38:42.625
She may play coy now,

38:42.708 --> 38:46.583
but she was a moon-eyed girl in love
from the moment we met.

38:46.666 --> 38:47.541
Oof!

38:47.708 --> 38:49.500
-Mmm!
-[Elrond laughs]

38:50.500 --> 38:52.583
A very happy match, indeed.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.458
Should've been at the wedding.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.166
Enough.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.791
-Your friend is here now.
-[slurping]

39:00.041 --> 39:02.041
Can we not take joy in that?

39:02.125 --> 39:03.541
He's not here for us.

39:03.625 --> 39:06.125
His king sent him here
to take what's ours.

39:06.208 --> 39:09.041
To the contrary.
Coming to Khazad-dÃ»m was my idea.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.250
And I have asked for nothing but your ear.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.166
Aye, and that's how it starts.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.250
And soon enough,
we're left with our thumbs in our eyes.

39:16.333 --> 39:19.166
-Elves for Elves, no?
-Has it ever been so between us?

39:19.250 --> 39:21.875
-I don't know! Has it?
-AulÃ«'s beard!

39:24.333 --> 39:26.458
Can you not find a way to mend this?

39:26.541 --> 39:28.875
[Prince Durin breathing heavily]

39:33.875 --> 39:35.708
I see you planted the sapling.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.083
Planted it. Raised it up.

39:39.625 --> 39:42.416
Tends it like it's our third child.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.250
What sort of tree is it, exactly?

39:46.041 --> 39:49.500
A seedling of our Great Tree in Lindon.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.875
The very symbol
of our people's strength and vitality.

39:53.208 --> 39:54.916
[Disa] Some called him a fool

39:55.583 --> 39:58.583
for believing it would grow
in such darkness.

39:58.666 --> 40:01.000
Where there is love,
it is never truly dark.

40:02.041 --> 40:05.000
How could it not grow
in a home like yours?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.916
You're not leaving already?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.500
I fear I've overstayed my welcome.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.208
Thank you, Disa, for your hospitality.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.375
Durin.

40:27.791 --> 40:28.750
[grunts]

40:30.041 --> 40:31.083
[sighs]

40:32.000 --> 40:33.458
Sod it, sit down.

40:34.625 --> 40:37.416
-Please. I hardly wish to intrude.
-I said sit.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.583
Are you certain?

40:38.666 --> 40:42.416
No. And I'm still angry.
Tell me about your king's proposal

40:42.500 --> 40:45.291
so I can decide whether
to present it to my father

40:45.375 --> 40:47.708
or toss it in the nearest slag pit.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.250
You needn't keep your distance.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.333
I am simply wondering what manner of man

41:20.416 --> 41:23.458
would so readily abandon
his companions to death.

41:23.791 --> 41:25.875
The sort that knows how to survive.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.583
Why be part of the larger target?

41:28.666 --> 41:30.166
You are a target still.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.500
I doubt we shall find safety
until we make landfall.

41:34.583 --> 41:37.000
I suspect finding safety
won't be that easy.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.125
Leastways not for you.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.375
"Separated" from your ship.

41:43.791 --> 41:44.833
Really?

41:45.958 --> 41:48.708
-You're a deserter, aren't you?
-Do I have the look of a deserter?

41:48.791 --> 41:52.208
You don't have the look of someone
to whom things happen by accident.

41:53.208 --> 41:55.083
Which means you were running.

41:55.166 --> 41:58.458
Whether toward or from something,
I haven't yet decided.

41:58.541 --> 42:00.875
Duty demanded I return to Middle-earth.

42:02.083 --> 42:04.375
And that is all you need to know.

42:04.458 --> 42:08.250
-Important Elf business, no doubt.
-What have Elves ever done to you?

42:08.333 --> 42:10.583
Do you blame us
for your being stranded here?

42:10.666 --> 42:13.875
The way I see it, it wasn't Elves
that chased me from my homeland.

42:15.375 --> 42:16.541
It was Orcs.

42:18.916 --> 42:19.791
[blazing]

42:25.458 --> 42:28.500
Your home. Where was it?

42:30.208 --> 42:31.708
What's it matter?

42:32.791 --> 42:33.833
It's ashes now.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.541
I know something of the pain you carry.

42:41.208 --> 42:42.291
I grieve for you.

42:47.125 --> 42:48.541
For those you lost.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.500
Around your neck.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.250
Was that the mark of your people's king?

43:00.333 --> 43:02.291
-My people have no king.
-But if they did,

43:02.375 --> 43:05.000
-where might that kingdom be found?
-To what end?

43:05.083 --> 43:07.416
What if I told you we might be able
to reclaim it?

43:07.500 --> 43:10.083
-[scoffs] I'm afraid you're short an army.
-Leave the army to me.

43:10.166 --> 43:11.750
Why're you dodging the question?

43:11.833 --> 43:13.208
Why're you stranded at sea?

43:13.291 --> 43:15.666
Because rather than rest in glory,
I chose to seek out

43:15.750 --> 43:18.125
the very enemy responsible
for your suffering.

43:18.208 --> 43:21.583
Look, Elf. You didn't cause my suffering
and you can't fix it.

43:21.666 --> 43:25.083
No matter how strong your will.
Or your pride.

43:26.791 --> 43:28.166
So let it lie.

43:28.625 --> 43:32.833
I have pursued this foe since
before the first sunrise bloodied the sky.

43:33.416 --> 43:36.083
It would take longer than your lifetime

43:36.166 --> 43:39.500
even to speak the names
of those they have taken from me.

43:40.166 --> 43:43.416
So letting it lie is not an option.

43:46.125 --> 43:49.791
At last, a little honesty.

43:49.875 --> 43:53.125
If you want to murder Orcs
and settle a score, that's your affair.

43:53.208 --> 43:54.875
Don't dress it up as heroism.

43:54.958 --> 43:57.291
Are you going to tell me
where the enemy is or not?

43:57.375 --> 43:58.541
The Southlands.

43:59.125 --> 44:00.166
[sighs]

44:02.041 --> 44:04.208
I need to know how many the enemy were,

44:04.291 --> 44:06.000
under whose banner they marched,

44:06.083 --> 44:09.875
and then you are going to take me
to their last-known location.

44:10.916 --> 44:12.541
I've got my own plans, Elf.

44:14.333 --> 44:18.000
[thunder breaking]

44:18.750 --> 44:22.291
[wind whooshing]

44:22.375 --> 44:23.458
Prepare yourself.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.791
-Watch it!
-[man] Easy now, love.

44:51.333 --> 44:53.375
-[chopping]
-What do you mean, "no bodies?"

44:53.458 --> 44:55.375
I mean the entire village was empty.

44:55.458 --> 44:59.000
It was as if the ground has swallowed up
the people of Hordern like flies.

44:59.083 --> 45:01.458
The ground here is tetchy.
Always has been.

45:01.541 --> 45:04.333
And Crookfinger Lake's
always seepin' vapors.

45:04.416 --> 45:06.000
-Mmm.
-[Bronwyn] I saw a tunnel.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.541
Dug deep, and with care.

45:07.625 --> 45:10.791
By what, I cannot say,
but they were digging towards us.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.250
I tell you, we remain here at our peril.

45:13.333 --> 45:14.750
We must spread the word.

45:14.833 --> 45:17.500
-[chops]
-No! I will not have this gossip, Bronwyn.

45:17.583 --> 45:20.958
I've seen landslides less dangerous
than a wayward tongue,

45:21.041 --> 45:24.625
and without proof or puddin',
that's all it'd be.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.125
Waldreg, we're all alone.

45:27.208 --> 45:29.750
Ostirith is empty.
The watchtower abandoned.

45:29.833 --> 45:31.791
Yes, I know,
and I'm not invitin' them Elves

45:31.875 --> 45:33.708
back on account of some sinkhole.

45:33.791 --> 45:37.791
Havin' them gone is a relief.
Well, for most of us, anyhow.

45:56.833 --> 45:58.708
[creaking]

46:00.791 --> 46:02.041
Bloody mice.

46:04.333 --> 46:06.625
[grunting]

46:06.708 --> 46:09.833
-[thudding]
-Stupid, bastard mice!

46:09.916 --> 46:11.166
[grunting]

46:18.708 --> 46:19.583
[screams]

46:22.333 --> 46:26.250
[rustling]

46:44.750 --> 46:47.666
[gasping]

46:53.833 --> 46:54.708
[grunts]

47:02.083 --> 47:03.333
[stones falling in distance]

47:10.833 --> 47:12.250
[voices whispering]

47:19.041 --> 47:20.375
[stones falling]

47:29.000 --> 47:30.375
-[growling echoes]
-[gasps]

47:35.458 --> 47:36.375
[growling]

47:43.750 --> 47:45.583
[rats squeaking]

47:48.500 --> 47:49.875
[grunting frantically]

47:54.458 --> 47:56.125
[rapid rustling]

You see, the next migration is in just

Three rabbits to the moon.

55:50.541 --> 55:52.125
I wanted to help you.

I don't speak firefly.

57:11.833 --> 57:14.333
[whispering continues]

57:35.458 --> 57:37.125
They're stars.

57:38.166 --> 57:41.125
A kind of constellation.

57:42.041 --> 57:45.583
Okay? They're stars? What does that mean?

57:45.666 --> 57:47.083
[Nori] This is how we help him.

57:47.166 --> 57:50.041
He wants us to help him find those stars.

[whispers] That's it, isn't it?

57:54.208 --> 57:55.416
Isn't it?

58:05.791 --> 58:07.583
I've never seen those stars before.

58:09.333 --> 58:12.333

where I can find them.

I'm certain of it. He doesn't know.

58:49.666 --> 58:50.833
Perhaps.

58:52.666 --> 58:53.833
Perhaps not.

58:57.416 --> 58:59.625
You've always had sandstone
in your granite

58:59.708 --> 59:01.708
as far as the Elves were concerned.

59:01.791 --> 59:04.125
Tell me, do you not think
it's a coincidence

59:04.208 --> 59:07.375
that an Elf should just land
on our doorstep? Now?

59:07.458 --> 59:10.375
I've known Elrond
for half a century, Father.

59:10.458 --> 59:12.750
I'd sense it if he were hiding something.

59:12.875 --> 59:16.500
Perhaps he sensed that it was you
who was hiding something.

59:16.583 --> 59:18.375
You think too much of their kind.

59:18.833 --> 59:21.416
We're the ones holding
the long end of the hammer here.

59:22.250 --> 59:24.541
Aye. For now.

59:28.791 --> 59:30.750
[Prince Durin]
Elrond is a friend. I trust him.

59:30.833 --> 59:33.500
[King Durin] There can be no trust
between hammer and rock.

59:34.166 --> 59:38.041
Eventually one or the other
must surely break.
