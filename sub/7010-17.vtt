TO TELL JACKIE
ABOUT THE TWO OF US,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.020
YOU'VE SEEMED
DISTANT.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.480

02:39.868 --> 02:42.744
WITHOUT YOU MAKING ALL
SORTS OF ACCUSATIONS?

02:42.912 --> 02:45.247
I MEAN, GOD, IT
WAS JUST A MINUTE.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.959
TO BE FAIR, DONNA... IT WAS
A LITTLE MORE THAN A MINUTE.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.135
DONNA, ONE OF YOUR DRUNKEN
UNCLES IS TOUCHING ME.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.514
OH, MY GOD.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.643
OH... MY GOD.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.382
OH, HONEY, THOSE
WEREN'T DARK TIMES.

03:37.550 --> 03:42.679
IT WAS... AN ECONOMIC SEGUEWAY.
PFFT!

03:42.847 --> 03:45.390
WELL, IT'S OVER.
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.561
COME ON, KITTY,
LET'S GET YOU PREGNANT.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.688
I'M KIDDING.

03:51.856 --> 03:57.152
YOU KNOW I CAN BARELY
STAND THE KIDS WE HAVE.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.738
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO?

03:59.906 --> 04:03.742
TREAT OURSELVES
TO SOMETHING NICE.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.372
I KNOW! WE CAN
TURN ON THE HEAT.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.296
ALL RIGHT...
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.298
NO.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.509
COME ON, DONNA. WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.927
AREN'T WE FRIENDS?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.262
WELL, YEAH.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.515
OKAY, THEN. SO...

04:26.683 --> 04:30.394
WHAT'D IT LOOK LIKE?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.853
JACKIE!

04:32.021 --> 04:35.732
OKAY, WE'LL COME BACK
TO THAT ONE.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.360
SO, HOW WAS IT?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.154
JACKIE, I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.823
OH...

04:42.991 --> 04:44.241
THAT BAD, HUH?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.534
NO!

04:45.702 --> 04:48.745
NO, NO.
IT WAS GREAT.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.290
IT JUST WASN'T
WHAT I EXPECTED.

04:51.457 --> 04:55.085
I DON'T THINK
WE DID IT RIGHT.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.006
SO ERIC'S NOT GOOD?

04:59.173 --> 05:02.509
IT WAS MORE LIKE... LIKE
NEITHER OF US WAS GOOD.

05:02.677 --> 05:07.222
DONNA, IT'S NOT UP
TO THE WOMAN TO BE GOOD.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.226
I DON'T KNOW, JACKIE.
I MEAN, I LOVE ERIC,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.812
BUT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME,

05:13.980 --> 05:17.607
IT WAS JUST, LIKE...
AWKWARD AND WEIRD...

05:17.775 --> 05:22.112
AND... I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
FELT SO FAR AWAY, YOU KNOW?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.699
NO.
BUT GO ON.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.160
DURING IT, I JUST
REMEMBER THINKING,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.705
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE...

05:31.873 --> 05:33.832
EVERYONE WHAT?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.419
THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.381
OH. SEE, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.175
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.678
OH, TRUST ME.
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.972
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, JACKIE?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.932
JUST DON'T TELL
ANYONE ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.310
OKAY.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.730
OKAY?!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.691

06:01.819 --> 06:03.028
YEAH, YEAH.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.656
AND ERIC...
WASN'T GOOD AT IT.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.078
WOW. REALLY?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.457
THAT'S GREAT!
HA HA!

06:18.878 --> 06:21.046
TV character: AND I WOULD'VE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT, TOO,

06:21.214 --> 06:24.674
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THOSE DARN KIDS!

06:25.843 --> 06:27.302
OH...

06:27.470 --> 06:29.763

06:39.690 --> 06:42.692
I THINK...

06:42.860 --> 06:46.488
FORMAN AND DONNA FINALLY MADE
THE BEAST WITH 2 BACKS.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.505
IN THAT ONE
MAGIC MOMENT...

07:45.673 --> 07:48.884
THE TWO PEOPLE, DONNA AND
ERIC, CEASED TO EXIST

07:49.051 --> 07:54.431
AND WERE REPLACED INSTEAD
BY ONE, PERFECT BEING.

07:55.766 --> 08:01.563
DONRIC FORMCIOTTI.

08:02.732 --> 08:07.861
SO... ERIC, YOU'RE

08:22.752 --> 08:24.711
SO, WELL,
MY FIRST TIME...

08:24.879 --> 08:29.007
JACKIE CALLED ME THE
APOLLO ROCKET OF LOVE.

WHAT KIND OF ROCKET
WERE YOU?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.263

JACKIE SAID?!

08:49.320 --> 08:52.197
YEAH. DONNA TOLD JACKIE.
JACKIE TOLD ME.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.034
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T TELL
JACKIE I TOLD YOU

08:56.202 --> 08:58.745
'CAUSE SHE'D GET PISSED.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.249
IT'S OKAY, ERIC. MAYBE
SEX ISN'T YOUR THING.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.262
ALL RIGHT.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.264
ALMOST THERE.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.599
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE WHAT WE GOT.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.434
OHH... YOU'RE

ARE YOU READY?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.145

DON'T YOU LOVE IT?!

09:33.531 --> 09:37.075
OF COURSE I DO, RED.

OH, YOU HATE IT.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.622
OF COURSE I DO, RED.
WHAT WOMAN WOULDN'T?!

09:43.749 --> 09:47.419
RED, I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT
WE WOULD GET SOMETHING

09:47.587 --> 09:51.423
WE BOTH WOULD ENJOY,
LIKE A... A NECKLACE.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.885
BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER
THAN A NECKLACE.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.470
HOW?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.598
WELL, IT'S...

09:59.765 --> 10:02.475
NOT A STUPID NECKLACE.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.148
BUT IT'S... SHINY!

10:15.323 --> 10:18.408
HEY.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.540
SO...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.542

10:27.710 --> 10:28.835
WELL...

10:29.003 --> 10:30.295
TURNS OUT I'M REALLY
LAME IN THE SACK.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.547
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

10:34.425 --> 10:35.550
WHAT?

10:35.718 --> 10:37.385
OH, IT'S ALL THE NEWS.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.346
JACKIE TOLD KELSO,
AND KELSO TOLD ALL OF US,

10:39.513 --> 10:42.682
SO... SORRY I'M
LAME IN THE SACK.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.810
I NEVER SAID THAT. I SAID
IT FELT AWKWARD AND WEIRD.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.690
OH...

10:50.858 --> 10:52.692
WHAT A RELIEF.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.778
YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.196
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

10:56.364 --> 10:57.530
I DON'T KNOW. HOW ABOUT,

10:57.698 --> 11:01.034
HEY, ERIC, YOU'RE
AWKWARD AND WEIRD?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.827
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.204
WE DID THIS
REALLY HUGE THING,

11:04.372 --> 11:05.914
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T
EVEN TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.000
WELL, GOD KNOWS,
YOU CAN TALK TO JACKIE.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.420
I KNEW THIS WAS
GONNA HAPPEN.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.047
WHAT?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.174
I KNEW THAT ONCE WE DID THIS,
EVERYTHING WOULD CHANGE,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.010
AND DAMNED
IF IT DIDN'T.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.888
WELL...

11:22.056 --> 11:23.348
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT,

11:23.516 --> 11:24.808
MAYBE WE SHOULD
NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.017
GREAT.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.561
OH... GREAT!
GREAT.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.650
OH, GREAT.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.826
LOOK, KITTY. LOOK HOW
GOOD I LOOK ON IT.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.121
HEY... WE COULD GET
MATCHING JACKETS.

11:46.288 --> 11:50.208
YOU KNOW HOW YOU LOVE
THINGS THAT MATCH.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.336
RED, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.630
OH, COME ON, KITTY.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.091
YOU KNOW THE LAST THING
I BOUGHT FOR MYSELF?

11:58.259 --> 12:01.010
A HOSE.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.929
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.265
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M WORKING AGAIN.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.058
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO GET OUT OF DEBT.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.144
AND WE HAVE TO PAY
FOR ERIC'S COLLEGE,

12:09.311 --> 12:11.354
AND WE GOT
LAURIE'S WEDDING,

12:11.522 --> 12:14.065
AND YOU KNOW WHOEVER
SHE ENDS UP WITH,

12:14.233 --> 12:18.361
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
ANY ROCKEFELLER.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.948
I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.493
WELL, AT LEAST, LET'S TAKE
ONE RIDE ON IT...

12:25.661 --> 12:29.080
BEFORE WE
BRING IT BACK.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.624
OKAY, FINE.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.878
[ENGINE STARTS]

[REVS ENGINE]

12:40.217 --> 12:43.386
OH! THAT FEELS
VERY NICE.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.726
MICHAEL, HOW COULD YOU?
WHAT'D I DO?

12:49.894 --> 12:53.021
MICHAEL, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT ERIC'S... SAD DILEMMA

12:53.189 --> 12:56.024
SO YOU COULD
MAKE FUN OF HIM.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.985
I TOLD YOU SO
YOU COULD HELP HIM.

12:59.153 --> 13:03.990
JACKIE, I CAN'T HELP HIM AND
BURN HIM AT THE SAME TIME.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.660
UH... I MEAN, COME ON, JACKIE.
IT'S FUNNY!

13:07.828 --> 13:10.580
HE MUST'VE BEEN
REALLY BAD.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.832
YEAH? WELL,
SO WERE YOU.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.336
OH! ALL RIGHT,
JACKIE,

13:16.504 --> 13:18.296
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, OKAY?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.089
'CAUSE YOU CALLED ME YOUR
APOLLO ROCKET OF LOVE.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.051
RIGHT, BUT I
SAID IT LIKE,

13:23.219 --> 13:25.011
[SARCASTIC]
OH, MICHAEL,

13:25.179 --> 13:30.600
YOU'RE A REGULAR
APOLLO ROCKET OF LOVE.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.979
OKAY, I DON'T HEAR
A DIFFERENCE.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.237
ERIC, IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

13:42.404 --> 13:45.365
MICHAEL WAS REALLY BAD
HIS FIRST TIME, TOO.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.909
Kelso: OH!

13:48.077 --> 13:49.869
OH. THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

13:50.037 --> 13:51.913
DOESN'T IT?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.833
YEAH, A LITTLE.
THANKS, JACKIE.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.880
FORMAN, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM WITH DONNA,

14:01.048 --> 14:05.468
AND AFTER HOURS OF
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION...

14:05.636 --> 14:09.889
IT STILL MAKES ME LAUGH.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.350
HEY, YOU LEAVE ERIC ALONE!

14:12.518 --> 14:16.354
ALL RIGHT? HE'S OUR FRIEND,
AND HE NEEDS OUR HELP

14:16.522 --> 14:18.314
IN THIS,
HIS MOST DESPERATE HOUR.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.776
I'M WITH YOU, BUDDY.
SEMPER FI!

14:22.653 --> 14:24.696
GEE, KELSO, WHY THE
SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.699
OH. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THE APOLLO ROCKET OF LOVE

14:27.867 --> 14:30.910
BLEW UP ALL OVER
THE LAUNCH PAD?

14:31.078 --> 14:33.955
HO HO! A MYSTERY.
ONE SUITABLE

14:34.123 --> 14:38.626
FOR SCOOBY DOO AND HIS
GANG OF CARTOON TEENAGERS.

14:38.794 --> 14:43.172
YOU KNOW, GUYS, SOMETIMES I
WISH WE WERE CARTOON TEENAGERS.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.968
ZOINKS.
THAT'D BE SUPER, FEZ.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.013
LOOK, MAN, IF GOD
HAD MEANT FOR VIRGINS

14:50.180 --> 14:53.433
TO LOSE IT
TO OTHER VIRGINS,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.977
HE WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN US
MIDDLE-AGED HOOKERS, MAN!

14:56.145 --> 14:58.187
AMEN, BROTHER!

14:58.355 --> 15:00.481
BECAUSE IF THERE'S
ON THING MEN LIKE US KNOW,

15:00.649 --> 15:03.526
IT'S HOW TO HAVE SEX.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.863
OH, I CANNOT LIVE
WITH THIS LIE.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.615
EVERYONE,
PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.744
I, FEZ, AM STILL A VIRGIN.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.456
GOSH, MY... WORLD
NO LONGER MAKES SENSE.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.249
FINE, HYDE, BUT NOW THAT
THE MIDDLE-AGED-HOOKER

15:18.417 --> 15:20.877
SHIP HAS SAILED, WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.712
WELL, I KNOW I
GOT A LOT BETTER

15:22.880 --> 15:25.214
WHEN I STARTED MAKING IT
WITH YOUR SISTER.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.382
I GOT IT!

15:26.550 --> 15:28.217
YOU SHOULD MAKE IT
WITH MY SISTER!

15:28.385 --> 15:30.887
KELSO, MAN, I'VE SEEN
YOUR SISTER.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.389
SHE'S A VIRGIN,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE...

15:33.557 --> 15:36.559
FOR A LOOOONG TIME.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.645
HYDE, WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

15:38.812 --> 15:42.273
I THINK HE'S SAYING...
MOOOOO.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.067
OKAY, MAYBE YOU
DID NOT HEAR ME.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.862
FEZ, THE MAN
YOU ALL REVERE,

15:48.030 --> 15:53.159
HAS STILL NOT HAD SEX.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.827
YEAH. HEARD YOU
THE FIRST TIME.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.289
FORMAN, YOU'VE GOTTA FIGURE
OUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG,

15:58.457 --> 15:59.624
MAN, AND FAST.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.877
YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN CALL GUYS
WHO ARE LAME IN THE SACK?

16:03.045 --> 16:06.673
JUST FRIENDS.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.216
YOU CAN'T LET THE PRESSURE
GET TO YOU.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.968
DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW
EMBARRASSING IT'D BE

16:10.135 --> 16:12.637
IF YOU TRIED
AND YOU COULDN'T,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.681
HOW SHE'D STARE AT YOU WITH
THOSE CRUEL, BLACK EYES,

16:14.848 --> 16:16.432
AS IF TO SAY...
[IMITATING JACKIE]...

16:16.600 --> 16:18.977
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
A MAN, MICHAEL.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.813
YOU'RE NOT A MAN AT ALL!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.899
O... KAY.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.778
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
REALLY HELPFUL, GUYS.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.864
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CALLED MY BLUFF.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.660
I AM NOT REALLY
A VIRGIN, HEH HEH.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.787
YES, I AM.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.587
AH, HA HA HA HA!
AH, HA HA HA HA!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.214
HA... HA HA!

16:48.382 --> 16:50.049
ALL RIGHT...
FUN'S FUN.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.384
TIME TO
TAKE IT BACK.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.053
NO.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.680
NO?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.349
NO. I LIKE IT.
I WANT TO KEEP IT.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.561
BUT YOU SAID YOURSELF WE GOTTA
SAVE MONEY FOR THE KIDS.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.980
OH, SCREW THE DAMN KIDS.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.443
OH, RED, I HAVE WORKED
DOUBLE SHIFTS ALL YEAR.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.862
I DESERVE THIS.
I WANT MY HOG.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.282
YOU KNOW...

17:14.450 --> 17:16.909
LAURIE MIGHT NOT
EVEN GET MARRIED.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.245
MAYBE ERIC WILL GET
A SCHOLARSHIP TO COLLEGE.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.915
WELL, HELL, HE MIGHT BE TOO
STUPID TO EVEN GET IN COLLEGE!

17:23.083 --> 17:24.959
WELL, RED,
WE CAN ONLY HOPE.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.836
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

17:27.004 --> 17:29.380
OKAY, SO JUST OUT OF
CURIOSITY... NO REASON...

17:29.548 --> 17:31.215
WHAT WAS YOUR
FIRST TIME LIKE?

17:31.383 --> 17:35.470
OH. MY FIRST TIME
WAS WITH A GUY NAMED...

17:35.637 --> 17:37.972
YOUR FATHER.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.808
MY FIRST TIME WAS WITH
THIS GUY NAMED DARREN.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.062
IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.482
OH, NO. WAIT. IT WASN'T DARREN.
IT WAS...

17:47.649 --> 17:49.817
ROBERT?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.195
I THINK ROBERT.

17:52.362 --> 17:57.492
WELL, UM... RED AND I WAITED
UNTIL AFTER WE WERE MARRIED.

17:57.659 --> 18:02.705
LIKE, 5 SECONDS AFTER
WE WERE MARRIED.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.248
WE SAID, TO HECK WITH
THE RECEIVING LINE,

18:04.416 --> 18:08.836
AND HIT THE NEAREST CLOSET.
HA HA HA HA!

18:09.004 --> 18:12.924
OH, I REMEMBER RUNNING MY HANDS
THROUGH HIS LONG, BLOND HAIR,

18:13.092 --> 18:17.428
AND LISTENING TO HIS
BEAUTIFUL BRITISH ACCENT.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.263
YOU SEE, BECAUSE BACK
THEN, YOUR FATHER

18:19.431 --> 18:23.059
WAS BLOND AND BRITISH.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.020
NO, NO, NO.
NOT ROBERT.

18:26.188 --> 18:30.399
THERE WAS THIS GUY...
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

18:30.567 --> 18:35.363
OR WAS IT HIS BROTHER?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.865
IT'LL COME TO ME.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.743
GOOD GOD, THAT DRESS MUST'VE
HAD A HUNDRED BUTTONS

18:40.911 --> 18:43.830
DOWN THE BACK, BUT RED
GOT IT OFF IN NO TIME.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.414
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT
TO LOOK AT HIM,

18:45.582 --> 18:47.542
BUT RED'S GOT
VERY NIMBLE FINGERS.

18:47.709 --> 18:51.087
NIM-BLE!

18:51.255 --> 18:53.673
I JUST REMEMBER IT WAS
VERY DISAPPOINTING,

18:53.841 --> 18:55.716
AND I NEVER SAW
THAT GUY AGAIN.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.718
I MEAN, YOUR FATHER.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.638
I MEAN, YOUR FATHER
WAS THE FIRST.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.809
DON'T TELL YOUR FATHER, OKAY?

19:04.977 --> 19:08.688
I WANT TO SAY BILLY...

19:08.856 --> 19:11.399
BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.901
ANYWAY, I JUST REMEMBER
THAT HE WASN'T VERY GOOD.

19:14.069 --> 19:18.865
...AND IT WAS
JUST WONDERFUL.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.993
EVENTUALLY.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.122
OKAY, DONNA...

19:26.290 --> 19:27.415
HERE'S THE DEAL.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.752
DO YOU HAVE
ANY ROLAIDS?

19:35.382 --> 19:37.258
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE SAID,

19:37.426 --> 19:40.720
ABOUT US NOT DOING
IT AGAIN?

19:40.888 --> 19:44.515
AND, UH, I'VE DECIDED
THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.309
BUT, ERIC, WE DID IT, AND NOW
EVERYTHING'S A MESS.

19:46.476 --> 19:52.732
SEE, DONNA... EVERYTHING
YOU AND I DO IS A MESS...

19:52.900 --> 19:56.986
AT FIRST.
I MEAN, FACE IT.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.864
WE'RE JUST A COUPLE
OF GOONS HERE.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.991
THE FIRST TIME
WE KISSED,

20:02.159 --> 20:03.409
THE FIRST TIME
WE WENT OUT...

20:03.577 --> 20:04.827
THE FIRST TIME I LET
YOU GET TO SECOND.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.413
EXACTLY.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.708
WAIT. WHAT DID
I DO WRONG THEN?

20:10.876 --> 20:14.378
GOD, IT WAS LIKE YOU
WERE TUNING A RADIO.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.845
OKAY.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.764
OKAY, BUT... DO I
STILL DO THAT?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.182
NO.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.934
AND THE KISSING... HAS THAT
GOTTEN BETTER?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.894
YEAH, LIKE,
A ZILLION TIMES BETTER.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.023
AND, DONNA, YOU KNOW WHY
THOSE THINGS GOT BETTER?

20:34.191 --> 20:37.693
BECAUSE WE KINDA CARE ABOUT
EACH OTHER, AND WE TALK...

20:37.861 --> 20:41.781
AND WE MAKE THINGS WORK.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.284
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
IT DOESN'T WORK?

20:45.452 --> 20:46.702
AND THEN NOT ONLY
DOES IT NOT WORK,

20:46.870 --> 20:48.246
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
WHAT WE USED TO HAVE?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.665
DONNA, WE WILL. WE LOVE EACH
OTHER, RIGHT?

20:50.832 --> 20:52.917
SO... TRUST ME.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.963
IT CAN ONLY
GET BETTER.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.803
OKAY, SO, I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS WE NEED PRACTICE.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.348
AND LOTS OF IT!
YES!

21:19.820 --> 21:21.529
SO?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.532
YEAH. IT WAS
A LITTLE BETTER.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.910
A LITTLE BETTER?

21:28.662 --> 21:31.372
I AM THE KING!

21:37.671 --> 21:41.090
HEY, MOM, ANY MORE
FRIED CHICKEN?

21:41.258 --> 21:44.010
WELL, MY GOODNESS, YOU'RE
A HUNGRY LITTLE BEE.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.639
YEAH, FORMAN.
WHATCHA BEEN DOING?

21:48.807 --> 21:52.601
EXERCISING?

21:53.061 --> 21:54.812
IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.107
HEY, I'M TOO SMART
FOR YOU TWO IDIOTS

21:58.275 --> 22:01.110
TO TRY INNUENDO WITH ME.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.528
GOT IT?

22:02.696 --> 22:05.781
YES, SIR.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.492
YOU GONNA EAT
THAT, BIG BOY?
