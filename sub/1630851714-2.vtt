JAMES BOND-STYLE MUSIC PLAYS

00:36.160 --> 00:39.920
Good evening, Mr Bond,
and welcome to the QI lair.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.600
I see you are not alone.
Oh, it's a very lively cat!

00:42.600 --> 00:44.600
CAT WAILS

00:42.600 --> 00:44.600
Thank you. Lively.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.880
Tonight's little, um, episode

00:46.880 --> 00:49.880
is dedicated
to Secrets, Spies and Sleuths.

00:49.880 --> 00:54.040
Allow me to introduce my associates
on a need-to-know basis.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.960
The hush-hush James Acaster.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00.480 --> 01:02.960
The highly classified Cariad Lloyd.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:06.560 --> 01:08.880
The top-secret Daliso Chaponda.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:11.600 --> 01:14.080
And the man with no name -
Alan Davies.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:16.840 --> 01:20.160
And their buzzers! James goes...

01:51.240 --> 01:53.080
LAUGHTER

01:56.080 --> 01:57.720
That's my favourite ever.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.760
It's good! I'll just...

01:59.760 --> 02:02.760
Anyway, there we go, OK.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.760
CAT SQUEALS

02:02.760 --> 02:06.520
I felt I couldn't spend
the entire show stroking my pussy.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.240
No, not the whole show.
People think this show's smart.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.400
Yeah. They're wrong. They're wrong!

02:13.560 --> 02:19.240
What might make you suspect
that someone was a spy?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.920
DALISO GASPS

02:22.760 --> 02:26.240
OK, I've actually got to say,
I'm very overqualified

02:26.240 --> 02:29.040
for this, right? Oh, are you? OK.
Well, I've met a spy.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.720
Have you? My father's
an African politician in Malawi.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.280
A few years ago, he was arrested.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.840
His office blew up.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.800
And, panicked, he asked me
and my brother to find him a spy,

02:41.800 --> 02:45.080
essentially to investigate stuff,

02:45.080 --> 02:49.480
and all of this culminated in us
meeting a spy

02:49.480 --> 02:51.440
at Wetherspoons.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.320
Was it
Shaken, Not Stirred Saturdays?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.960
CARIAD: What was he wearing?

02:58.960 --> 03:00.360
He did not look like I expected -

03:00.360 --> 03:02.360
he looked more like
a heavy-metal drummer,

03:02.360 --> 03:05.080
like long-haired, big guy,
lots of tattoos.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.600
OK, so we're possibly going
a bit more trad than that. OK.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.960
So you've got a top-secret briefcase
right next to you, my darling.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.120
If you pick that up,
the thing that has betrayed a spy

03:15.120 --> 03:17.520
is in that briefcase.
So if you open that up...

03:17.520 --> 03:20.000
Nobody has a proper briefcase
any more, do they?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
No, sadly. I like that noise,
don't you?

03:22.400 --> 03:25.400
Yeah. "Ker-chunk!"
It suggests business is afoot.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.440
Right. What have we got?
I know I've gained

03:27.440 --> 03:28.840
a lot of weight recently,

03:28.840 --> 03:32.520
but is this an intervention?
It's a Fitbit.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.520
So, what happened was, in 2018,
they were tracking data from Fitbits

03:37.520 --> 03:42.560
and it made it possible to work out
where soldiers at American military

03:42.560 --> 03:44.560
bases had been jogging.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.600
So the data came from a company
called Strava, and it's used

03:47.600 --> 03:50.400
by Fitbits and smartphones
and so on to log exercise,

03:50.400 --> 03:52.800
and they released this
heat map of activity.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.720
But it was a huge problem for places
like Afghanistan and Syria

03:55.720 --> 03:59.840
because the Army had given away
2,500 of these Fitbits

03:59.840 --> 04:02.360
as part of an exercise plan
to get people moving.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.240
And everybody could work out
where they were!

04:04.240 --> 04:06.640
"Guys, you've got to stay secret,
absolutely secret."

04:06.640 --> 04:08.600
Wow. "But here is this GPS."

04:08.600 --> 04:10.120
Cariad, let's have a look.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.200
You've got a briefcase as well.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.320
See what's in yours. I feel like
the really cool kid at school.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.240
"Brought my own briefcase, guys."
Oh! What have you got?

04:19.240 --> 04:21.480
I have got some moustaches. Ooh.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.080
Which one do you think suits you?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.600
Well, there's some here...

04:24.600 --> 04:27.720
There's the smarty, the
rogue, the scoundrel,

04:27.720 --> 04:29.200
Casanova, party boy.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.600
I think I'm a party boy.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.240
But then, what about
the Frida Kahlo? Oh, Frida Kahlo.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.800
That's very good. Oh, nice.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.800
The monobrow.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.600
The top really sells it as well.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.320
Yeah. I'd seen a monkey.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.440
You would not draw attention
to yourself at all if you had that.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.040
A lot of people look like that
in Wetherspoons.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.360
So, this is a true story.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.840
In 2008, an MI6 officer
appeared on The One Show

04:52.840 --> 04:56.320
to talk about recruitment, and
he was wearing a false moustache.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.640
No! And it fell off
during the segment.

04:58.640 --> 05:02.440
So the studio lights had weakened
the glue and the interviewer

05:02.440 --> 05:05.080
eventually had to point out
that it was peeling off.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.720
And he replied,
"I was worried that might happen."

05:07.720 --> 05:10.120
And he put it in his pocket
for the rest of the interview.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.920
They edited that bit out and it was
obscured in the final programme,

05:12.920 --> 05:14.480
so the viewers didn't know about it.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.280
But don't you think
that's marvellous?

05:16.280 --> 05:19.320
James, you've got a briefcase.
Let's have a look at your briefcase.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.160
What have you got in there?
I genuinely can't open it.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.360
CARIAD: Don't pretend you didn't
have a briefcase at school!

05:25.360 --> 05:26.840
James has got loads of briefcases!

05:26.840 --> 05:29.440
CARIAD: He's like, "Oh, how does
this work?" Oh, yeah.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.720
Hold on a sec.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.320
I think I've changed
the combination.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.640
I'm going for 007.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.720
Yeah. Hold on.
I'm putting on gloves...

05:38.720 --> 05:41.240
I'm not saying that
your career as a spy is over,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.400
I just think...
I reckon this is broke.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.600
Push it here. Yeah.
I've got gloves on now.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.960
OK. I really hope, I really hope
you can't do this first time.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.400
Let's have a go.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.120
CLICK!

05:55.720 --> 05:57.560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:59.160 --> 06:00.920
LAUGHTER

06:03.880 --> 06:07.320
And with rubber gloves on, James!
Rubber gloves! I know, right?!

06:09.280 --> 06:11.120
What is it? Is it worth it?
What have you got?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.760
It's empty.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.680
I have... Yes. ..a notebook.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.240
Oh, no, a passport and some staples.
OK.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.840
Are the staples meant to be in here?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.840
Yes. They are. So, they go together,
the passport and the staples.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
What do you reckon?

06:27.840 --> 06:31.040
I think that if you're a spy...

06:31.040 --> 06:33.560
Yes. ..and you don't want people
finding out your identity,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.360
you staple your passport together.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.360
And then they can't open it
and find out who you are.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.920
Genius! Well, here's the thing.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.000
For years, the Soviet Union was able
to catch spies due to staples.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.200
So, American staples
are made of stainless steel,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.880
they are not in the Soviet Union.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.600
And that meant the Soviet Union ones
rusted over time,

06:52.600 --> 06:54.320
due to moisture in the air.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.000
And so, official Soviet passports

06:56.000 --> 06:59.120
were stained around the staple,
brown. Wow! Passports forged

06:59.120 --> 07:00.960
in the United States by their agents

07:00.960 --> 07:03.920
did not have rust stains, and
that would make people suspicious.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.440
Ah! That's amazing!

07:05.440 --> 07:09.000
It's very cool, isn't it? REALLY
cool! Right, Alan, your briefcase.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.600
Do you need help or do you think
you'll be able to open it?

07:11.600 --> 07:15.560
No, I don't! Really difficult, Alan.
Take your time.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.360
Oh, straight away!
First time, James!

07:17.360 --> 07:19.720
LAUGHTER

07:17.360 --> 07:19.720
Pretty easy!

07:19.720 --> 07:21.520
Here's the REALLY annoying thing.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.960
I can't close this now...!

07:21.520 --> 07:23.960
LAUGHTER

07:23.960 --> 07:28.040
What have you got, darling? I've got
loads of fabric. It's laundry.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.080
It's laundry. So laundry and spying.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.280
How would you think that
goes together?

07:32.280 --> 07:35.200
Hide in the laundry basket,
like they do in cartoons.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.040
You can sew things into things,
Sandi, you could sew things

07:38.040 --> 07:40.160
into garments. Secret messages.
You could. Yes.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.960
There are lots of stories actually
to do with laundry and spying.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.240
So during World War I,
Frieda Lawrence, who was married

07:45.240 --> 07:48.080
to DH Lawrence, she lived with
her husband on the Cornish coast,

07:48.080 --> 07:50.960
and she came under suspicion
because she was rather exacting

07:50.960 --> 07:52.440
about hanging her laundry out.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.840
And it was thought that she was

07:53.840 --> 07:57.040
hanging it on the line in a specific
way to give messages to U-boats.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.360
It didn't help that
she was German, OK?

07:59.360 --> 08:02.440
Her father was Baron von Richthofen.
Not the famous one,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.640
but another Baron von Richthofen.
There's so many.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.280
And she received deliveries
of German newspapers every day,

08:07.280 --> 08:09.920
so they were just a little bit,
you know, suspicious.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.800
They were given a military exclusion
order and made to leave the area.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.120
Was she hanging up, like,
duvet covers

08:15.120 --> 08:17.400
with "attack at midnight"
written on them?

08:17.400 --> 08:20.560
Well... "The base" and an arrow!

08:20.560 --> 08:23.800
"Go that way!"
It's not a completely ludicrous

08:23.800 --> 08:26.640
suspicion, James, because
during the American Civil War,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.720
there was an African-American called
Dabney, and he got a job as a cook

08:29.720 --> 08:31.040
at the Union headquarters.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.440
And at the same time,
his wife worked as a laundress

08:33.440 --> 08:35.880
for a Confederate general,
and she would listen

08:35.880 --> 08:38.440
to the Confederate plans
and then she would signal

08:38.440 --> 08:40.280
to her husband
using the washing line.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.720
So, you know, that grey shirt
is "Long Street",

08:42.720 --> 08:45.560
and when she takes it off,
it means he's gone down here.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.760
So it absolutely has form,
people using laundry.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.760
But poor old Frieda Lawrence.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.880
What's so secret about this?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.760
Um, is it, like,
a very low-budget, like, Bond pen?

08:58.760 --> 09:00.560
It is the pen itself. Ah!

09:00.560 --> 09:03.520
Yes, it is the pen itself that
we are interested in.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.200
This is a ballpoint pen. It was kept
secret from the Chinese, for years.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.040
Is it something about the way that
the ink works in a ballpoint pen?

09:12.040 --> 09:13.280
It's sort of to do with that.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.960
It's to do with the actual
manufacturer of the ballpoint pen.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.760
So, until 2017, so,
fairly recently,

09:17.760 --> 09:21.440
although China supplied
80% of the world's ballpoint pens,

09:21.440 --> 09:23.360
it was importing the pen tips,

09:23.360 --> 09:26.040
because it didn't know how
to make them.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.880
The ballpoint pen needs
to hold a ball in a socket,

09:28.880 --> 09:31.200
and that's what
connects it to the inkwell.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.640
So you can see - it is a steel ball,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.720
capable of writing for about 800
metres, I think,

09:34.720 --> 09:37.040
and it was a closely
guarded trade secret,

09:37.040 --> 09:40.320
and China simply had neither
a machine capable of making

09:40.320 --> 09:44.000
the ball small enough, or the right
type of steel that wouldn't crack

09:44.000 --> 09:47.320
when it was cut, and in 2015,
China's Premier, Keqiang, went to

09:47.320 --> 09:49.760
a seminar in Beijing and complained
that this was the big thing.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.040
"The real situation facing us is
that we cannot make ballpoint pens

09:54.040 --> 09:55.600
"with a smooth writing function."

09:55.600 --> 09:57.520
And they thought that
the day they could,

09:57.520 --> 09:59.360
that would make China
a world-class place.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.600
I don't see how you can
reverse engineer an iPhone,

10:02.600 --> 10:04.800
but not a ballpoint pen!

10:04.800 --> 10:07.480
It's actually an extraordinary
thing, but it's that small,

10:07.480 --> 10:10.760
and it doesn't crack, it's the right
kind of steel, and it'll accept

10:10.760 --> 10:14.160
the ink, and so on. They can
now do it, just to let you know.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.280
It took five years
of intense research.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.560
What were they doing wrong?

10:17.560 --> 10:20.760
Did they have a massive
ball at the end?

10:20.760 --> 10:22.680
"We've made one, but it's enormous!"

10:22.680 --> 10:27.440
No, Chen Ping, it's no good. Go back
to the drawing board! Start again!"

10:27.440 --> 10:31.000
Get it down to a tennis ball size.
"Will this do?"

10:31.000 --> 10:33.560
But doesn't that, because you never
really think about it, do you?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.000
This tiny little ball of steel.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.480
OK, now, you've got
a fully functioning Biro,

10:37.480 --> 10:39.680
what do you need
if you want to write a...

10:39.680 --> 10:41.120
Paper!

10:41.120 --> 10:42.920
BLAST OF "AUSTIN POWERS" THEME

10:42.920 --> 10:44.480
LAUGHTER

10:44.480 --> 10:46.400
Paper!

10:46.400 --> 10:49.320
No, I want to add a secret message!
Invisible ink.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.440
Invisible ink, exactly right!

10:51.440 --> 10:53.640
This is a true story.
In 2019, there was

10:53.640 --> 10:57.280
a student at university in Japan
who got full marks on her essay.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.360
She was writing about ninja history,

10:59.360 --> 11:02.680
and she handed it in with
invisible ink made from soybeans.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.960
What a ninja thing to do!
It IS a ninja thing to do.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.280
She's like, "Boom!" "I got this!"
"Give me the degree. I am a ninja!"

11:08.280 --> 11:10.560
It was the ninja museum of Iga-Ryu,

11:10.560 --> 11:13.120
and it is the ninja art
of aburidashi.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.400
You can't get into
the museum, though.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.920
You can't find it. Impossible.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.960
They send you a ticket
to get in and it's just...

11:18.960 --> 11:21.160
Nothing. You can't read it.
Get to the door, someone throws

11:21.160 --> 11:23.000
a shuriken in at your head.
It's very difficult.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.360
She sent her professor a message
with the essay saying,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.880
"Heat this paper up on a stove,"
and he did.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.840
Did anybody ever do that as a kid?
We used to write...

11:29.840 --> 11:31.760
Lemon juice.
..lemon juice, yes.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.400
Secret messages in lemon juice.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.080
You can also use urine...

11:35.080 --> 11:36.640
LAUGHTER

11:36.640 --> 11:38.840
It's lower budget...!

11:38.840 --> 11:41.840
If you want to do it again,
you can use piss, actually!

11:41.840 --> 11:44.240
You don't have to waste your lemons.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.400
Make it a love letter!
Send it to your betrothed.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.920
"Heat this up!"
"Mm, definitely from him! Mm!"

11:50.920 --> 11:52.600
Can you imagine? Semen, darling?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.080
Semen as well? Yeah.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.840
I tell you what, though, if that's
a long letter, you're impressed.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.560
LAUGHTER

12:01.440 --> 12:03.560
Really? How many pages, James?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.800
"You've written a book?!"

12:03.560 --> 12:05.800
LAUGHTER

12:05.800 --> 12:08.040
"And you're telling me
none of this was written in piss.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.880
"I'm impressed!"

12:09.880 --> 12:12.360
So, invisible ink not the only way
to send secret messages.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.080
You can also do it with eggs.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.440
Does anybody know how?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.680
Oh, the egg white.
Is it the egg white?

12:17.680 --> 12:20.040
No, with an actual egg,
so, send somebody an egg.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.560
And it's got a secret message,
but how?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.320
You can see - nothing written.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.640
Do you have to put it
in something, like, liquid?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.040
So, it was a 16th century Italian
scholar

12:29.040 --> 12:31.400
called Giambattista della Porta,

12:31.400 --> 12:33.640
and he was really
interested in cryptography,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.760
he was known as
the Professor of Secrets,

12:35.760 --> 12:38.000
and he used to use eggs
to send messages.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.040
So, what it is is, you leave the egg
in vinegar for four hours, OK?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.840
This softens the shell.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.080
Then you make a tiny little
incision in the shell.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.320
You slot a small message through
the incision so that the paper sits

12:51.320 --> 12:53.680
basically between the shell
and the egg white,

12:53.680 --> 12:56.720
you then repair the cut,
using some plant gum or something,

12:56.720 --> 12:58.560
and put the egg
back into cold water,

12:58.560 --> 13:02.720
and that will harden the shell
again. So let me show you.

13:04.360 --> 13:10.000
OK, like that. And in here is
a message that says...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.200
Oh, wow!
Isn't that great? Wow!

13:14.200 --> 13:15.640
That is really cool!

13:15.640 --> 13:18.640
Yeah! That is so cool!
That is so cool, isn't it?

13:18.640 --> 13:22.080
And he discovered that in 1584.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.320
If you don't have egg white, you can
just fill an egg with semen,

13:24.320 --> 13:26.520
I think, it's the same thing.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.800
It's quite a long way
to send a message, isn't it?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.240
Yes, but here's the thing.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.040
When people are having
food deliveries and so on,

13:32.040 --> 13:33.280
if you're having eggs delivered,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.840
nobody's going to go
and check all the eggs!

13:34.840 --> 13:36.840
That's like,
do you know Josephine Baker?

13:36.840 --> 13:39.000
She was a marvellous spy.
She was a brilliant spy,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.560
and it was all in the musical notes.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.360
So when she was living in Paris she
would just carry her music around

13:43.360 --> 13:45.320
and if she was stopped,
it would just look like music

13:45.320 --> 13:46.480
but it was in the,

13:46.480 --> 13:49.880
the notes were spelling out
messages for the Resistance.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.040
How would you use this
to send a secret message?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.200
That's going to need a big egg!

13:55.200 --> 13:57.400
LAUGHTER

13:57.400 --> 13:59.640
Someone would know the cypher.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.560
So, E = B...

14:01.560 --> 14:03.120
You don't need to know anything.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.480
Oh, is it the way you fold it?
Does it then make a message?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.160
It is the way you wrap
it around something. Wow!

14:08.160 --> 14:09.240
It's called a scytale.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.520
It's an ancient Greek way
to hide messages.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.880
All it required was that the person
sending and the person receiving

14:14.880 --> 14:17.600
had the same size stick.
That's cool.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.080
And then you would just send this,

14:19.080 --> 14:20.760
which could be wrapped up
quite small

14:20.760 --> 14:25.320
and you wrap it around like this
and it says,

14:25.320 --> 14:27.520
"This is a scytale."

14:27.520 --> 14:28.720
Isn't it clever?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.240
That's very clever. I know.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.360
I'd love it if you got it
and that was the message.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.640
And then you just had to reply,
"I know what a scytale is!

14:36.640 --> 14:38.520
"It was my idea to use 'em!

14:38.520 --> 14:40.440
"Can you please stick to the plan?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.800
"We're trying to
bring down a government here!

14:42.800 --> 14:45.720
"I don't need you to tell me what
the equipment is that we used!"

14:45.720 --> 14:47.800
Wow, this is so cool, right?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.600
The rest of it just is gibberish.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.760
It would take you a while to work
out. It also says...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.720
SHE MUMBLES GIBBERISH

14:53.720 --> 14:56.320
That's the Danish version.
It IS the Danish version!

14:56.320 --> 14:57.600
PHONE RINGS

14:57.600 --> 15:00.840
Oh, sorry, I'll just get out
my handkerchief.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.080
Er, hello? Yes?

15:05.080 --> 15:07.840
No. No, Moneypenny, I've told you
not to ring me at work.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.920
Yeah.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.480
OK. The Banker?

15:11.480 --> 15:13.480
LAUGHTER

15:15.160 --> 15:17.800
Who would use a secure phone
like this?

15:17.800 --> 15:20.920
Commissioner Gordon.
Commissioner Gordon!

15:20.920 --> 15:24.000
That's such a good reference.
Anybody else? Who would use...?

15:24.000 --> 15:28.280
Again, this is a totally
unnecessary Chaponda back story!

15:28.280 --> 15:31.960
But we needed one of those
because we were always bugged.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.800
Right. And the reason I know this
is, in Kenya, the Malawi ambassador

15:36.800 --> 15:40.160
happened to be a high-school
friend of my mum,

15:40.160 --> 15:43.480
and gave my mum
a bunch of my dad's secrets.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.240
Really?! Yeah.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.040
When you say secrets, like...

15:48.040 --> 15:50.920
He's been "calling this woman",
what's going on? Oh, secrets!

15:50.920 --> 15:52.560
Yes. Wow!

15:52.560 --> 15:54.920
Have you ever had therapy,
because...?

15:54.920 --> 15:58.600
Is it too late to bring up?
My dad is the Mayor of Kettering.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.040
On numerous occasions,

16:02.040 --> 16:04.280
people have tried to push him over,

16:04.280 --> 16:07.680
and I had to meet a spy
in a Harvester once.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.680
And, let me tell you, he looked

16:11.680 --> 16:15.680
more like a bass player
in a prog band, this man.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.480
You were OK, though? And I DO
go to therapy, just so you know.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.280
So, who might have had
a red telephone? A head of state?

16:24.280 --> 16:25.920
Yeah. President?

16:25.920 --> 16:29.320
So, the one that we normally think
of is the US and Russia hotline.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.080
It was often called
the red telephone.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.600
It was neither red nor a telephone.
What?! Yeah, I know.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.680
I'm destroying things for you!
What?!

16:35.680 --> 16:38.960
So June 1963, we'd just
had the Cuban Missile Crisis,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.440
and it took 12 hours at
that time to get messages

16:41.440 --> 16:42.600
backwards and forwards.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.720
They agreed to establish a sort of
direct form of communication.

16:45.720 --> 16:49.440
The very first message sent
by the Americans in August 1963

16:49.440 --> 16:52.880
read, "The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog's back.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.920
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0."

16:55.920 --> 16:57.760
You had to wrap it round a stick!

16:57.760 --> 16:59.360
Why would they send that?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.800
Because it has every letter
in the world. Uses every letter!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.160
Yeah. Which is called? Oh!

17:03.160 --> 17:04.680
The alphabet.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.040
LAUGHTER

17:07.280 --> 17:10.080
They were trying to show that
they could send all the letters

17:10.080 --> 17:12.280
and that they could actually
communicate directly, because,

17:12.280 --> 17:13.680
in fact, the system consisted not

17:13.680 --> 17:15.600
of telephones,
but of teletype machines.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.360
So there were four teletype
machines in Moscow, four more in

17:18.360 --> 17:21.280
the Soviet embassy in Washington,
and the message was sent over

17:21.280 --> 17:23.600
a 10,000-mile-long
transatlantic cable.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.240
Why is it called the red telephone,
if there's no red telephone?!

17:26.240 --> 17:27.920
It maybe just sounds better.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.160
The 1971 system updated
the use of a satellite connection,

17:32.160 --> 17:35.280
and, most recently, they've
upgraded to a fibre optic link

17:35.280 --> 17:38.920
allowing both email and finally
talking, but only recently. Wow.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.080
There were red secure telephones
in the UK. They were introduced

17:42.080 --> 17:45.040
in the 1950s. Oh! This, and that's
why I was so careful touching it,

17:45.040 --> 17:48.440
is a real Pickwick phone.
It's been lent to us by GCHQ. Wow!

17:48.440 --> 17:50.320
So the Pickwick system was in place

17:50.320 --> 17:53.600
and used during the Cuban Missile
Crisis for secure communication,

17:53.600 --> 17:56.120
but it was between the then
Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan,

17:56.120 --> 17:57.320
and President Kennedy.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.800
And basically this would attach
to the cypher unit and that sort of

17:59.800 --> 18:02.320
mashed up the speech
and prevented eavesdroppers from

18:02.320 --> 18:04.840
understanding what was going on.
What I like is the British Army,

18:04.840 --> 18:06.280
they thought this
is the way to do it.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.640
They used to hire operators
with strong regional accents

18:08.640 --> 18:10.880
so that if anybody was
eavesdropping, they thought,

18:10.880 --> 18:13.360
"Well, they'll never understand
what they bloody said!"

18:13.360 --> 18:17.480
IN WELSH ACCENT: Listen, we're
going to invade at 20 past 5, OK?

18:17.480 --> 18:20.040
And it's going to be, oh,
it's going to go mad, I tell you!

18:20.040 --> 18:22.840
Everyone's going to be kicking off,
you're not going to believe it!

18:22.840 --> 18:26.400
Understand? All right? Ta, bye.
All right, bye, bye, bye.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.440
You wouldn't know. You'd
have no idea what was going on.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.680
Even Welsh people! We do have,
and I think this is seriously cool,

18:32.680 --> 18:34.240
we have another secure phone.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.640
It's just over on the table
cos I don't want to touch it.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.960
It's also incredibly heavy.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.120
It's called Brahms, and it is
a portable, secure line

18:41.120 --> 18:42.640
that comes in a suitcase.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.080
And this is the one that
was used by Margaret Thatcher

18:45.080 --> 18:47.360
during the Falklands War.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.320
Wow. Wow. This is very cool,
isn't it?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.920
She was able to open it,
James, which was nice.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.880
We are joined virtually now
by Dr David Abrutat,

18:55.880 --> 18:58.880
GCHQ's Departmental Historian.

18:58.880 --> 19:03.320
Dr David is one of a very few number
of GCHQ employees to be avowed.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.080
What does that mean, David,
you are avowed?

19:06.080 --> 19:09.480
Essentially it means
I'm publicly known,

19:09.480 --> 19:13.240
and, as the department's historian,
my role's to tell the story

19:13.240 --> 19:16.560
of our organisation's history
over the last 100 years.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.600
So, tell me, the one I want
to hear about is, there was

19:19.600 --> 19:23.160
a secret line called Sigsaly.
Can you tell me about Sigsaly?

19:23.160 --> 19:27.120
During the Second World War,
the British and American governments

19:27.120 --> 19:30.480
needed to talk frequently
on a secure line.

19:30.480 --> 19:35.600
And in November 1942, GCHQ's
Alan Turing went over on a liaison

19:35.600 --> 19:39.560
visit to the States, to the Bell
Laboratories, who were researching

19:39.560 --> 19:42.480
and developing a new secure
communications system,

19:42.480 --> 19:43.960
which was called Sigsaly.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.240
And it was an absolute monster,
it weighed 50 tonnes.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.520
It included 40 racks of equipment

19:49.520 --> 19:52.720
and drew something like
30 kilowatts of power.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.640
And it was certainly known
by the users as the Green Hornet

19:56.640 --> 19:59.920
because of its irritating
buzzing noise on the line.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.200
And the first Sigsaly was installed
in the Pentagon in the States,

20:05.200 --> 20:09.240
and the second was installed
in the basement of Selfridges

20:09.240 --> 20:10.640
in Oxford Street,

20:10.640 --> 20:15.640
so certainly on the first trial run
on July 15th 1943, Winston Churchill

20:15.640 --> 20:19.120
was using this piece of equipment
in the basement

20:19.120 --> 20:21.840
of Selfridges
before they put in extension lines

20:21.840 --> 20:25.080
to 10 Downing Street,
if the rumours are true.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.640
Fantastic. Alan, did you want
to ask anything?

20:27.640 --> 20:31.000
Well, I've seen Thatcher's
briefcase, and I just wondered,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.960
did she take it on holiday?
Did she carry it herself?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.360
DR ABRUTAT: Did Margaret Thatcher
ever go on holiday?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.200
ALAN: Perhaps not!

20:38.200 --> 20:42.360
DR ABRUTAT: The briefcase phone
you've got is called Brahms,

20:42.360 --> 20:45.320
which was developed in
the early 1980s, and it was used

20:45.320 --> 20:48.880
by the British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, at the time,

20:48.880 --> 20:51.760
during the Falklands conflict,
to communicate securely

20:51.760 --> 20:55.880
with her Cabinet and to the senior
military officers of the time.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.400
Well, it's been fascinating.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.880
I don't know if you send love
to everybody at GCHQ!

20:59.880 --> 21:01.960
I send love to everyone at GCHQ.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.760
And thank you very much,
Dr David Abrutat.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.040
Now, complete this sentence.

21:10.040 --> 21:15.240
If you're invited to a penetration
party, it's best to practise safe...

21:19.520 --> 21:21.720
Safe words.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.200
In case things get hairy.
That's very...

21:24.200 --> 21:25.960
And I'm worried that you know that!

21:28.880 --> 21:30.600
What are they penetrating?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.120
That's the question.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.080
Is it a person? No, it isn't.
Thank goodness for that.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.720
You are best to practise
safe cracking.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.960
Penetration party
is a perfectly innocent phrase

21:40.960 --> 21:42.680
used by safe crackers to describe

21:42.680 --> 21:46.600
an all-night event
where they practise opening safes.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.800
Wow! And it was invented
by accident,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.400
so there was a safe cracker
who was called Dave McOmie.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.600
He's a bit of a legend,
this guy, OK. He edits

21:53.600 --> 21:56.120
the International
Safecracker magazine.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.320
Wow. He looks exactly like
I thought he would.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.000
That's not even him.
That's a general look, frankly.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.280
Can we talk about the guy
in the background

22:05.280 --> 22:06.800
with the orange back support?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.760
Yeah, that is worrying, isn't it?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.240
I really want to be in the shot

22:10.240 --> 22:12.600
where he was buying that
back support, going,

22:12.600 --> 22:15.000
"I'm going to
a penetration party later.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.560
"I'm going to need
a back support for it.

22:17.560 --> 22:21.360
"Just the best one you've got.
It's a big penetration party.

22:21.360 --> 22:25.160
"A lot of guys." "This one
comes with a free matching cap."

22:25.160 --> 22:26.680
"Oh, perfect!"

22:26.680 --> 22:29.600
He's the only one with the
headphones on! Who's he talking to?

22:29.600 --> 22:31.480
There's someone in the safe.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.000
IN MUFFLED VOICE: "I'm inside now.
Are wearing the back support? Over."

22:35.000 --> 22:38.240
"Yeah, but I'm the only one.
I'm standing out."

22:38.240 --> 22:41.760
So they were at a convention
in Philadelphia and one

22:41.760 --> 22:44.000
of the attendees mentioned
that he had a warehouse

22:44.000 --> 22:46.440
filled with about 80 safes,
which all needed opening.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.240
So they decided to do
a masterclass with these 80 things.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.880
Everybody got their equipment.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.320
They spent all night,
all night working on the safes.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.480
They managed to open
every single one of them.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.120
And now it's become a thing.
People have penetration parties.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.720
But how WOULD you open the safe?
Do you know the different ways?

23:00.720 --> 23:03.560
No idea. Twice I've moved house,

23:03.560 --> 23:07.160
and there's been a safe, big safe,
in the house I couldn't get in.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.360
And the second time
it happened to me, I thought,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.760
"I want to get rid of that." It took
six men. I wasn't one of them -

23:12.760 --> 23:16.760
I didn't have a back support.
No. Incredibly heavy thing.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.800
And to this day,
I don't know what was in it.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.760
Oh, wow. I mean, the weight of it,
presumably loads of gold.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.160
Oops!

23:26.920 --> 23:30.120
The best thing, if the mechanism
has slipped a bit, you can work

23:30.120 --> 23:33.200
on the dial. The easiest thing is
what these guys are doing here,

23:33.200 --> 23:35.280
which is to drill a hole.
I love this.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.520
"Just use a sledgehammer,"
it says. That's it.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.760
Just get in and biff it.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.000
I might go to a penetration party
and ask if they run

23:43.000 --> 23:45.440
a course for briefcases.

23:49.320 --> 23:53.400
"I've been struggling lately
and I'm working my way up

23:53.400 --> 23:56.720
"to a safe, but first of all,
I'm only

23:56.720 --> 23:58.960
"halfway there with a briefcase.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.240
"I'll just sit in the corner
while you do the safe stuff."

24:02.240 --> 24:04.560
IN AMERICAN ACCENT:
James, put on the back support,

24:04.560 --> 24:06.040
strap in and watch.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.040
There are other ways
to break into secure buildings

24:10.040 --> 24:12.600
if you think outside the box.
This is a wonderful story.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.120
In 1971, there was
an activist group called

24:15.120 --> 24:17.960
the Citizens' Commission
To Investigate The FBI,

24:17.960 --> 24:21.760
and they targeted a draft board
in Delaware, and to gain access,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.600
all they did was they left
a note on the door that read,

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
"Please don't lock
this door tonight."

24:26.600 --> 24:29.080
No! Yeah. And nobody did.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.200
So it completely worked.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.360
They went in and stole
everything that they needed.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.400
That's genius! Isn't that brilliant?

24:37.400 --> 24:40.200
And it revealed evidence of
massive wrongdoing and spying

24:40.200 --> 24:42.640
and criminal activity
by Edgar Hoover's FBI,

24:42.640 --> 24:44.360
which was then sent to journalists.

24:44.360 --> 24:47.320
And 200 agents went on a manhunt
to try and find out who did it.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.400
And they never did find the people.
CARIAD GASPS

24:49.400 --> 24:53.080
Another way to break into a safe is
to bypass the doors entirely, OK?

24:53.080 --> 24:57.440
I love this story. 1836, the Bank of
England got an anonymous letter when

24:57.440 --> 25:00.640
the sender claimed to have access
to their stash of gold, OK?

25:00.640 --> 25:03.200
So, offered to prove it by
meeting staff from the bank

25:03.200 --> 25:05.600
in the vault at a time
of their choosing.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.040
So, time was set, the bank managers
go into the vault

25:08.040 --> 25:11.920
and they saw a man appearing up
through the floorboards,

25:11.920 --> 25:14.720
and he had been working on
the sewers and he had discovered,

25:14.720 --> 25:17.640
by fluke, that you could
get up into the safe.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.760
He didn't take anything
and the bank was so grateful,

25:19.760 --> 25:24.040
they gave him £800, which is
about 80 grand in today's money,

25:24.040 --> 25:26.480
and arranged for the vault
to be made more secure.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.160
Wow! Somebody going,
"The floorboards!"

25:29.160 --> 25:32.000
I love that he must have been
standing there covered in shit,

25:32.000 --> 25:36.200
from the sewers, being like,
"See? I got right in."

25:36.200 --> 25:37.760
And they're like, "That's amazing.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.720
"Stand back, just don't
come too near, Dave."

25:39.720 --> 25:42.120
He could have nicked it all
because they didn't know about it.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.760
He could have taken a bar each day
and they wouldn't even notice.

25:44.760 --> 25:49.160
No idea. Anyway, moving on.
How do you kick-start a Spitfire?

25:49.160 --> 25:51.840
Hm. Oh, does it have a crank?

25:51.840 --> 25:55.560
Do you get a glamorous lady,
to get in and sort it out for you?

25:55.560 --> 25:59.120
Well, she's probably one
of the amazing women who delivered

25:59.120 --> 26:02.400
Spitfires once they had been built.
They were delivered by volunteers,

26:02.400 --> 26:04.360
and about a fifth of them
were women. Wow.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.440
What do we talk
about kick-starting now?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.880
Oh, like, you go online and you say,
"Please give me money."

26:09.880 --> 26:12.600
"Please give me money.
I want to go to drama school."

26:12.600 --> 26:15.760
Yes. Yes. What,
and then rival me in my career?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.800
I think not. Not happening.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.320
It's crowdfunding. It's exactly...
No. Yeah.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.640
So they needed to raise
the money for the planes.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.320
And if you raised a certain amount,
you were allowed to name the plane.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.800
What? So crowdfunded Spitfires
were called things

26:28.800 --> 26:30.120
like All The Fun Of The Fair,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.720
and carnivals and circuses people
put that together.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.640
This is the early Boaty McBoatface,
basically. Yeah.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.520
The Dogfighter was the Kennel Club.

26:37.520 --> 26:41.120
Unshackled Spirit
was funded by British POWs

26:41.120 --> 26:43.280
while they were being
held in Germany.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.120
That's so great! You know,
the actual name Spitfire... Yeah.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.400
..is because the engineer,

26:49.400 --> 26:52.320
his nickname for his daughter
was Spitfire.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.240
It was actually
the owner of the company.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.920
The owner? But imagine he'd called
her, like, Dumpling or something.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.880
"I name it after my son, Dickhead."

27:06.000 --> 27:08.880
"The Unfortunate Mistake."

27:08.880 --> 27:11.600
"Not Really Mine, as I call him."

27:13.560 --> 27:16.240
Takes After Her Mother.
Call her that.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.040
Yes, you know, the daughter, Ann,
her nickname was Spitfire, you're

27:19.040 --> 27:22.120
absolutely right, but the project
manager wanted to call it Scarab

27:22.120 --> 27:25.160
or Shrew. Wouldn't be
the same, would it?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.560
But the fact that POWs,
British POWs,

27:27.560 --> 27:29.080
who were being held in Germany...

27:29.080 --> 27:32.160
So what happened was
they crowdfunded via a series

27:32.160 --> 27:34.560
of coded letters that were
sent in and out of prison,

27:34.560 --> 27:37.680
and the prisoners would instruct
that Army pay be redirected

27:37.680 --> 27:40.080
to the Swedish Red Cross,
and the Red Cross sent it

27:40.080 --> 27:41.840
to the British Army
to fund Spitfires.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.680
So they were still getting funds
when they were POWs in Germany?

27:44.680 --> 27:46.920
You still got paid
even though you were being held.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.480
They redirected it, yeah.
That's incredible.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.480
There were some marvellously
inventive ways to raise funds.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.400
There was a Kent farmer who
charged people sixpence to see

27:56.400 --> 28:00.240
the only field in Kent without
a German aircraft in it.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.640
Market Lavington, which is
a village in Wiltshire, they drew

28:04.640 --> 28:07.120
an outline of a Spitfire in the
square and they asked people to fill

28:07.120 --> 28:10.320
in the outline with coins and it hit
the target in a matter of days.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.520
Spitfires, theoretically, were
priced at about £5,000 each,

28:13.520 --> 28:16.000
so you were told eight shillings
would buy a spark plug,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.200
£2,000 would get you a wing,
that kind of thing.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.160
In reality, it's not like that. It's
very much like when you sponsor

28:21.160 --> 28:23.880
a snow leopard. Yes. You don't
get a specific snow leopard.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.600
No. Oh, really? Yeah.
I did not know this, James.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.720
So, my oldest daughter,
when she was younger,

28:28.720 --> 28:32.120
she was obsessed with sheep and
I sponsored a sheep at London Zoo.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.200
And one day, she said,
"Can we go and look?"

28:34.200 --> 28:37.080
And it was pouring with rain
and I had this photograph that

28:37.080 --> 28:38.720
I had downloaded,

28:38.720 --> 28:42.720
and we stood in the rain with all
these sheep in the petting zoo.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.920
And she was going,
"No, it's not that one, Mum."

28:44.920 --> 28:49.360
Well, if anybody watching sponsored
an African child, it was me.

28:49.360 --> 28:54.040
Thank you. Thank you. So lovely.

28:54.040 --> 28:57.240
The Spitfire project as a whole owes
everything to one woman who I think

28:57.240 --> 29:00.000
most people won't know about,
but she is one of my heroines.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.120
She's called Lady Lucy Houston.
She's fantastic!

29:03.120 --> 29:07.080
She knew that Britain would need
a really strong air force.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.080
She knew this after World War I,
and the Government refused to pay

29:10.080 --> 29:12.560
for the development of aircraft,
so she did.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.160
She personally paid the amounts
of money that was needed

29:15.160 --> 29:17.640
for Rolls-Royce and
Vickers Supermarine to create

29:17.640 --> 29:19.760
the engine and the aircraft
that became the Spitfire.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.600
And I think most people won't know
about her. She died in 1936.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.280
She never knew the impact of what
she did, but she looked forward.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.120
Without her, we simply would not
have had the Spitfire.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.120
I think she's amazing and I think
she's really worth knowing about,

29:32.120 --> 29:34.120
as indeed, do you know about
Hazel Hill? No.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.080
Hazel Hill was 13 years old
when her father, Fred Hill,

29:37.080 --> 29:39.280
was working for the Air Ministry,
and she helped him do

29:39.280 --> 29:42.680
the calculations that eventually
showed a Spitfire could be armed

29:42.680 --> 29:44.800
with eight machineguns
and not four.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.280
And they did the sums
at the kitchen table. And she,

29:47.280 --> 29:50.240
a 13-year-old, thought to have
helped with the Battle of Britain.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.680
And then, later in life,
she was saved by a Spitfire

29:52.680 --> 29:54.360
that she had helped to create.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.320
There was a German plane overhead,
and then when she turned to look,

29:57.320 --> 29:59.360
a Spitfire was chasing it off.
So that's nice.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.760
And the pilot was like,
"Thanks, Hazel!

30:03.320 --> 30:05.040
"Keep doing your maths!"

30:09.120 --> 30:11.920
At 13, she fixed Spitfires
and then we're like,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.680
"James, can you open
this briefcase?" Yeah.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.720
Er...

30:17.040 --> 30:19.440
And then, my favourite thing
about Spitfires, some of them

30:19.440 --> 30:22.760
were transformed into beer
delivery services after D-Day.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.080
So, after the D-Day landings,

30:24.080 --> 30:26.880
the British troops were
rather low on beer in France

30:26.880 --> 30:29.240
and so they hatched a plan
to make the extra fuel

30:29.240 --> 30:31.800
tanks for the Spitfires
into beer delivery things.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.320
And they steam-cleaned them
and then filled them with beer,

30:34.320 --> 30:37.120
although apparently still
strong taste of petrol.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.400
Fantastic!

30:39.400 --> 30:41.680
Anyway, we're sticking with wartime

30:41.680 --> 30:45.320
and imagine you've got
your enemy surrounded, OK?

30:45.320 --> 30:47.680
How are you going to undermine them?

30:47.680 --> 30:52.160
My parents are so good at it.
Just compare them to their brothers.

30:52.160 --> 30:56.800
Say, "Your sister's got two kids
already." "What's wrong with you?"

30:56.800 --> 30:58.120
"What's wrong with you?" Yeah.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.800
"Your brother's a doctor."
That sort of thing.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.640
But your enemy, how are you
going to undermine your enemy?

31:03.640 --> 31:06.040
Are you talking about
literally going under... Digging?

31:06.040 --> 31:08.200
..like in the rather
brilliant novel Birdsong?

31:08.200 --> 31:11.200
Have you ever read Birdsong?
No, is it good? It's brilliant!

31:11.200 --> 31:13.320
It's largely
set in the First World War,

31:13.320 --> 31:16.440
but there's a whole section in it
where miners are trying to

31:16.440 --> 31:19.360
dig under the enemy trenches. Well,
you're absolutely right, darling.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.040
It's military mining.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.680
So a tunnel that you dig,
for example, underneath

31:23.680 --> 31:26.320
a target during a siege
is called a sap

31:26.320 --> 31:28.880
and it's often under
the weakest part of a fortress,

31:28.880 --> 31:30.080
like a gatehouse or something.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.440
So you dig a tunnel and
a support tunnel with wooden beams

31:32.440 --> 31:34.360
and then you basically set
fire to the beams,

31:34.360 --> 31:37.560
it collapses both the tunnel
and the target above the ground.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.320
And it has been used for
thousands of years as a crucial

31:40.320 --> 31:42.440
tactic in siege warfare.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.800
And we use the term sapper today
to refer to a military engineer.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.280
We say "the sappers"
and it's about digging a sap,

31:48.280 --> 31:49.960
digging a tunnel under something.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.200
So how do you stop somebody
sapping towards you?

31:53.200 --> 31:57.120
Would you put, like, big steel
things down so that they can't...?

31:57.120 --> 32:00.120
The easier thing to do, weirdly,
is to dig another tunnel. Oh.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.080
To weaken their tunnel?
Underneath theirs.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.360
Oh. Yes.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.640
It's called counter mining,

32:04.640 --> 32:08.760
so you basically allow
their tunnel to collapse down

32:08.760 --> 32:12.040
and siege warfare often
resulted in battles underground,

32:12.040 --> 32:14.160
actual physical fights
inside the tunnel.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.440
But underground fighting,

32:15.440 --> 32:18.240
hand-to-hand combat was thought
to be the height of courage and

32:18.240 --> 32:21.720
chivalry and if you fought somebody
underground in one of these tunnels

32:21.720 --> 32:24.080
and didn't kill them, there was
an understanding that if you

32:24.080 --> 32:27.360
came across them on the ground later
on, you would spare them again.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.200
You were now brothers in arms.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.040
I'd try to fake it.
Like, I meet someone, I'm like,

32:32.040 --> 32:34.120
"Hey. wait, didn't
you and me have a thing?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.880
"It was dark down there,
it was me! It was me.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.400
"We had a thing, right?"

32:39.400 --> 32:41.800
Henry V fought hand-to-hand
in a tunnel during

32:41.800 --> 32:45.360
the siege, I think it's pronounced
Melun, in 1420 and his opponent,

32:45.360 --> 32:48.360
a Captain Barbazan,
used this convention

32:48.360 --> 32:50.920
when they met later on and
Henry was going to execute him,

32:50.920 --> 32:53.680
and he said, "No, wait a minute, we
did that fighting in that battle."

32:53.680 --> 32:56.320
That's not in the play, is it?
They should have put that scene in.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.600
The tunnel scene.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.560
You know St Andrews, if you go,
you can see both the mine

32:59.560 --> 33:01.320
and the counter mine
under the castle,

33:01.320 --> 33:05.600
both built during a siege in 1546.
Wow. It was dug through solid stone.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.360
That's extraordinary. Isn't that
amazing? Invading Catholic forces

33:09.360 --> 33:11.280
and defending Protestants.

33:11.280 --> 33:15.680
How would you win a siege with
just an ox and a handful of corn?

33:16.920 --> 33:20.280
Now, so far, a lot of your...
Here's what I've noticed. Yes.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.160
Your questions are really tricksy.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.840
Because...

33:25.840 --> 33:29.560
..we all think it means one thing
but actually you've snuck another

33:29.560 --> 33:32.880
word in there that means something
else, you've got a double meaning.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.040
So an ox, a handful of corn. Yes.

33:36.040 --> 33:40.600
So, an ox probably
street slang for Oxo cube.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.800
Erm... A...

33:43.800 --> 33:47.560
..handful, I'm guessing
it's not a human handful,

33:47.560 --> 33:49.880
you're more going for like
a gorilla-size handful,

33:49.880 --> 33:51.040
it's much bigger.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.800
And corn is the nu metal band
Korn from the '90s.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.720
So, that is what you're going for.

33:57.720 --> 34:03.320
You play '90s nu metal, throw Oxo
cubes at them, thrown by a gorilla.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.560
Can I have the points, please?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.440
It's about fooling your enemy.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.200
That's another way to win, right?

34:10.200 --> 34:12.880
Ah! You paint an ox to look
like a giant corn on the cob

34:12.880 --> 34:15.200
and then, all the villagers
run at it

34:15.200 --> 34:17.400
and start trying to
turn it round and eat it

34:17.400 --> 34:20.000
and it just attacks
them and goes hog wild.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.840
It's a legend from Luxembourg.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.400
So, the legend is that
there was a castle siege

34:24.400 --> 34:26.920
and the people inside were running
dangerously low on supplies

34:26.920 --> 34:28.680
and they were on
the edge of starvation

34:28.680 --> 34:31.640
and all they had left was
an ox and a handful of corn.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.680
So, what they did was
they fed the corn to the ox

34:33.680 --> 34:36.520
and they killed it and they threw
the innards over the castle wall,

34:36.520 --> 34:39.480
and the enemy looked at
the guts of the dead animal

34:39.480 --> 34:43.200
and it was full of food and they
deduced, wrongly, that they had

34:43.200 --> 34:46.560
plenty of supplies and resources
and so they called off the siege.

34:46.560 --> 34:51.120
But I like that. I like being
clever rather than killing.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.240
Could have gone badly wrong
though, couldn't it?

34:53.240 --> 34:56.440
"Now we haven't even got the corn!"
Exactly!

34:56.440 --> 34:59.000
Now, it's time to slip
surreptitiously into

34:59.000 --> 35:01.560

35:32.160 --> 35:34.160
"That's general ignorance!"

I'm going to try that from now on!
I'm going to give that a go.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.800
That's general ignorance!

35:40.800 --> 35:42.280
That's so good.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.800
So good, Sandi!

35:44.840 --> 35:48.240
Right. It stands for screw. People
used to distinguish between ships

35:48.240 --> 35:51.640
driven by paddles and ships that
were driven by propellers or screws,

35:51.640 --> 35:54.560
and when paddleships started
to be phased out, the SS seemed

35:54.560 --> 35:56.120
to stick around.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.960
And can I just say, to pre-empt
any letters we might receive from,

35:58.960 --> 36:02.200
I don't know, say there was A Pedant
watching, it is true to say that

36:02.200 --> 36:05.080
two ships normally referred to
these days as SS Great Western

36:05.080 --> 36:08.920
and SS Great Eastern
both had paddles, but the SS prefix

36:08.920 --> 36:11.800
has only been attached
to them in modern times.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.440
So, in their day, they were known...
This is entirely different

36:14.440 --> 36:17.920
from the German SS,
which is much more, much more...

36:17.920 --> 36:20.520
More problematic. More problematic.

36:20.520 --> 36:24.200
We didn't name our ships after them,
as, like, a little joke!

36:24.200 --> 36:27.400
"SS - remember those guys?
That was crazy!"

36:27.400 --> 36:29.640
Those so-and-sos!
Also, the way you said,

36:29.640 --> 36:31.680
"In case there's A Pedant watching,"

36:31.680 --> 36:34.440
made me think there is just one guy
who writes in all the time,

36:34.440 --> 36:35.920

36:39.400 --> 36:43.800

There was a Japanese games
manufacturer called Maki Kaji,

37:55.240 --> 37:58.280
who brought them to Japan, and they
wanted to give it a new name.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.720
And he said, "My staff are
pushing me to give it a new name,

38:00.720 --> 38:02.280
"and I wanted to go horse racing.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.160
"So I just created a name really

38:05.160 --> 38:08.680
Now, I'm going to say it all wrong,
so I think we've written it out.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.800
What that means is numbers
should be single, unmarried,

38:11.800 --> 38:15.560

decided to shorten it to Sudoku.

Well, I'd say finely ground, Sandi.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.320

the beans that you expose more

40:12.320 --> 40:14.200

40:14.200 --> 40:17.240

40:17.240 --> 40:19.520
You would think so
but if they are too fine,

40:19.520 --> 40:23.680
they clog the espresso machine and
then they moisten unevenly and they

40:23.680 --> 40:26.560
make the drink more
sour and more bitter

40:26.560 --> 40:29.160
than if you use coarser grains.
And the reason I know this,

40:29.160 --> 40:31.520
mathematicians published
a paper called

40:31.520 --> 40:33.920
Systematically Improving Espresso -

40:33.920 --> 40:37.720
Insights from Mathematical
Modelling and Experiment.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.400
What they found is that if coffee
shops actually use slightly less

40:40.400 --> 40:41.880
coffee than they're currently using,

40:41.880 --> 40:44.200
so they suggest about
15g instead of 20g, it would

40:44.200 --> 40:46.320
not only improve the taste,
it would have the

40:46.320 --> 40:48.960
added benefit of using
fewer beans, so the coffee shop

40:48.960 --> 40:51.240
will end up with better
drinks for a lower price.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.440
So don't pack it in too tightly.
Don't pack it in too tight.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.160
That's not a reference to coffee!

40:57.920 --> 41:01.280
You just said, "Don't pack it in too
tight," I know what prop's being

41:01.280 --> 41:04.080
bought out here.
Here we go. Here we go.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.720
See how quick she is.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.920
CAT SCREECHES

41:05.720 --> 41:07.920
Oh!

41:11.480 --> 41:16.480
Now, in homage to one of
the most-famous fictional spies,

41:16.480 --> 41:19.840
I think we should end
with a martini, OK?

41:19.840 --> 41:22.440
So, how would anybody
like theirs?

41:22.440 --> 41:23.960
Shaken, not stirred. No?

41:23.960 --> 41:26.440
KLAXON

41:23.960 --> 41:26.440
What?! Oh.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.280
So, the thing is that shaking
a martini will ruin it,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.440
and I know this
cos I'm a martini fan, OK?

41:33.440 --> 41:35.560
So drinks like daiquiris,
they're shaken

41:35.560 --> 41:38.280
and the reason for that is that
the ice dilutes the sweetness.

41:38.280 --> 41:41.040
Martinis are not sweet,
so they don't need to be shaken.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.000
They're supposed to be served
as concentrated as possible.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.560
Unfortunately we can't drink
the original martinis

41:46.560 --> 41:48.520
that James Bond
is supposed to have had

41:48.520 --> 41:51.120
because one of the key ingredients
is no longer available.

41:51.120 --> 41:54.560
It's known as a Vesper Martini. It
was named after the first Bond girl,

41:54.560 --> 41:57.840
she was called Vesper Lynd.
Vespa's Italian for wasp.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.560
Did you know that? No, I didn't.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.760
Yes, hence the scooter.
The scooter, the Vespa.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.600
It sounds like a wasp.
Bzzzzzz! Wasp. You see?

42:04.600 --> 42:08.440
The Vesper Martini
contained gin and vodka

42:08.440 --> 42:11.160
and something called Kina Lillet.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.760
Doesn't sound pleasant, does it?
It would absorb a lot.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.480
You don't want THAT in your martini.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.400
Anyway, the trick is...to stir it.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.520
Have you got drinks there
for yourselves? Yes. Yes.

42:22.520 --> 42:26.320
OK. Just, um, pour out...
in tribute here.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.760
Ooh-hoo! OK.

42:28.760 --> 42:32.200
Do you know that Dick Van Dyke
was once asked by Cubby Broccoli

42:32.200 --> 42:35.880
if he wanted to take over
from Sean Connery in the role,

42:35.880 --> 42:39.400
and Dick Van Dyke reminded him
of his British accent as Bert,

42:39.400 --> 42:42.240
the Cockney chimney sweep
in Mary Poppins.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.040
It was generally thought
not to be a very good idea.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.880
Well, here we go.
Cheers. Cheers.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.760
AS SEAN CONNERY: Martinis are
better shtirred than shaken,

42:50.760 --> 42:54.080
and underpants
are better shilk than shatin.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.560
LAUGHTER

42:56.560 --> 42:59.000
APPLAUSE

43:00.400 --> 43:04.520
And, with that, it's the final dash
towards the scores!

43:04.520 --> 43:07.240
Top of the pack
with nine points,

43:07.240 --> 43:09.280
it's Alan! What?!

43:09.280 --> 43:12.520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:14.520 --> 43:16.360
Second, with eight points,

43:16.360 --> 43:19.920
it's James!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:19.920 --> 43:23.000
I couldn't even open a briefcase,
and who got beat by me?!

43:23.000 --> 43:24.480
Yes!

43:24.480 --> 43:27.280
Third with -2, Daliso!

43:24.480 --> 43:27.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:27.280 --> 43:30.320
CARIAD: Oh, no!

43:30.320 --> 43:33.840
And in last place with -15,
it's Cariad!

43:33.840 --> 43:36.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:41.680 --> 43:44.320
My thanks to James, Cariad,
Daliso and Alan, and I leave you

43:44.320 --> 43:47.400
with this secret sign-off
from Lucille Ball.

43:47.400 --> 43:50.320
The secret of staying young
is to live honestly,

43:50.320 --> 43:52.480
eat slowly and lie about your age.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.640
Goodnight.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
