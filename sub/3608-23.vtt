00:02.001 --> 00:03.419
Previously on Lost:

00:03.504 --> 00:06.839
You ever think they put you here
to push a button every 100 minutes

00:06.924 --> 00:10.635
- just to see if you would?
- Every single day.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.471
Your tour of duty in The Pearl
will last three weeks.

00:13.555 --> 00:19.352
You and your partner will observe
a psychological experiment in progress.

00:19.436 --> 00:24.524
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

00:24.608 --> 00:26.693
is as useless as that button.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.696
If you will not continue
to push the button, John...

00:29.780 --> 00:30.988
...I will.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.492
I'm writing four names down.
Four of your friends.

00:34.576 --> 00:38.079
If you don't bring
all the people on the list,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.248
you'll never see Walt again.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.126
- Walt? I'm sorry! Come here!
- Dad!

00:43.252 --> 00:44.877
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.295
I will get you out.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.590
- Dad! Dad! I love you!
- I love you too, Walt.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.135
Michael?

00:53.470 --> 00:54.971
Michael has been compromised.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.057
- Why would he lie to us?
- I believe he's leading you to a trap.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.144
- I have to get my son back.
- We're gonna help you, Michael.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.979
It's gotta be the way I said, man.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.023
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley.
That's it.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.486
Boat.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.039
Are we rescued? Are we saved? Hey!

01:22.124 --> 01:23.833
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:25.002 --> 01:27.044
Perhaps it's them.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.741
- You see anything?
- No.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.331
- Maybe it's a trap.
- What do you mean, a trap?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.244
You hear that?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.594
Damn it!

03:11.567 --> 03:13.025
You.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.611
So... before you ran off,

03:56.695 --> 04:01.032
I guess you just forgot to mention
that you still have a sailboat.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.118
Why'd you come back?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.999
You think I did it on purpose?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.088
I was sailing for two and half weeks,

04:16.173 --> 04:19.675
bearing due west and making nine knots.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.762
I should've been in Fiji
in less than a week.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.807
But the first piece of land I saw
wasn't Fiji, was it? No.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.811
No, it was here. This... this island.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.523
And you know why?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.109
Because this is it.

04:37.194 --> 04:41.405
This is all there is left.
This ocean and this place here.

04:41.490 --> 04:44.909
We are stuck in a bloody snow globe!

04:46.870 --> 04:50.331
There's no outside world.
There's no escape.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.378
So just... just go away. Let me drink.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.389
Are you still pushing it?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.519
Yeah, we're still pushing it.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.490
Set of keys.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.867
One pocket watch, gold-plated.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.537
One photograph.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.673
One book: Our Mutual Friend.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.885
Why didn't you bring that inside?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.848
To avoid temptation, brother.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.809
I've read everything Charles Dickens
has ever written.

05:51.893 --> 05:56.939
Every wonderful word.
Every book, except this one.

05:57.024 --> 06:02.695
I'm saving it. So it will be
the last thing I ever read before I die.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.198
Nice idea. As long as you
know when you're gonna die.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.662
Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume,

06:11.747 --> 06:15.416
your sentence is hereby complete,
and you are now and forever

06:15.500 --> 06:18.544
dishonorably discharged
from the Royal Scots Regiment

06:18.628 --> 06:21.964
of Her Majesty's Armed Forces.
Long live the queen.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.675
Enjoy your sodding book.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.732
You want a ride?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.572
Not with you.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.616
Get in the car.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.132
Did you bring me a present?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.384
Actually, two presents.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.805
One of these boxes
contains your past, Hume.

07:10.889 --> 07:15.559
The other, your future.
Go ahead. Open it.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.574
You're a bastard, you know that?

07:30.659 --> 07:33.702
The fact that she never received your...

07:33.787 --> 07:36.288
Your sentiments is good for her.

07:36.373 --> 07:40.668
Good because, as far as she's concerned,
you've forsaken her.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.046
- And that's the way it's going to stay.
- Is it now?

07:44.631 --> 07:49.218
Penelope's moved on, Hume.
She's getting married.

07:56.768 --> 08:02.064
This is for your new life,
away from my daughter.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.403
The conditions are simple.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.407
No contact. No calls. No post.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.828
You just... run away, Desmond.

08:17.330 --> 08:22.126
And what makes you think
I would just run away?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.756
Because you're a coward.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.474
On the way to the funeral,

08:37.558 --> 08:40.436
I told you Michael had been
compromised by the Others.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.440
And then you asked me how
we might take advantage of that.

08:44.524 --> 08:49.195
I believe fate
has given us our answer: the boat.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.571
The boat.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.699
This camp Michael
is leading you to across the island,

08:53.783 --> 08:56.035
that is where they will set their trap.

08:56.119 --> 09:00.206
While Michael leads you by land,
I can approach far more quickly by sea,

09:00.290 --> 09:02.791
and I can go ashore undetected.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.503
- Go ashore and do what?
- Scout them.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.423
Their numbers and positions.
Their weapons.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.677
Then I'll go to the nearest beach
and start a signal fire with these.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.180
They burn with a dark black smoke.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.850
You and your team
will come to meet me at the signal,

09:19.935 --> 09:22.394
and we will go in together.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.856
We're not even sure
if Michael's been turned by them.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.067
He has been turned.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.073
I'll have to tell Kate, Hurley
and Sawyer what we're doing...

09:34.157 --> 09:38.619
No. Michael cannot sense
we know he is lying.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.081
All we have
is the element of surprise, Jack.

09:42.165 --> 09:46.168
Right now, it's only
your responsibility to keep it secret.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.215
Black smoke, huh?

09:52.634 --> 09:56.679
This time,
they will know that we are coming.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.562
Hello, John.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.691
Where have you been?

10:11.236 --> 10:13.612
I've been thinking.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.489
About what?

10:18.201 --> 10:21.620
That in a minute,
that computer's gonna start beeping.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.790
And when it does,
you're gonna let it go.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.502
You're gonna let it
run down to zero, past zero,

10:28.586 --> 10:30.504
and you're not gonna push the button.

10:31.423 --> 10:35.134
But I am going to push the button.
Why wouldn't I?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.303
Because you don't want to be a slave.

10:39.639 --> 10:44.018
- I am a slave to nothing.
- You're a slave to that.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.395
Just like I was.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.856
So I'm gonna tell you again...

10:49.899 --> 10:52.151
...don't push it.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.822
Do not tell me what I can't do.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.041
You cannot push that button!

11:15.842 --> 11:19.595
No, it's not real! We're only puppets!

11:19.679 --> 11:22.264
Puppets on strings!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.767
As long as we push it,
we'll never be free.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.519
Well, you're free now, John.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.773
- Do not come back.
- No.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.542
No way. If I take that,
I'm gonna kill someone.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.586
Ain't that the point?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.755
I thought the point
was to get Walt back.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.928
What's the matter?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.766
All that stuff
we found in the medical station.

12:05.850 --> 12:11.480
Costumes, makeup, fake beards. They
want us to think they're hillbillies.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.233
Listen. Listen, I was there.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.236
I saw them.
They are hillbillies. They live in huts.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.197
They eat fish. They're
probably more scared than we are,

12:20.281 --> 12:22.616
and they have no idea we're on our way.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.581
All right. Enough jibber-jabber.
Let's roll.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.861
I need your boat.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.450
I wouldn't waste your time.
There's nothing out there, pal.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.954
I'm not going out there. I need to
get to the north shore, and quickly.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.291
- Off to see the hostiles, are you?
- The what?

13:12.375 --> 13:16.336
You know what? Ignorance is bliss.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.924
The boat's all yours, brother.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.927
For all the good it'll do you.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.891
I don't know how to sail.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.852
Then I suggest
you find someone who does.

13:40.403 --> 13:44.281
Just give me whichever one
has the most caffeine in it, brother.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.619
Damn.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.331
I'm sorry, I've just arrived,

13:52.415 --> 13:55.501
and I spent
all my American money on a taxi.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.960
I've got it.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.924
- That's not necessary.
- It's just four bucks.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.678
I don't suppose you have
42,000 more of those, do you?

14:06.763 --> 14:09.681
- Depends on what it's for.
- I was joking.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.350
No, you weren't.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.688
A solo sailing race around the world?

14:16.773 --> 14:20.275
I've got eight months
to get into the best shape of my life.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.278
But I'll tell you what, miss.
I'm going to win.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.531
And what do you get if you do?

14:25.615 --> 14:30.494
What really matters...
is who I win it from.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.875
"Charles Widmore."

14:36.960 --> 14:39.795
He tried to buy me off,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.589
and when I didn't take his money,

14:42.674 --> 14:46.426
he took away the only thing in the world

14:46.511 --> 14:48.554
that I ever truly cared about.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.223
Who is she?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.851
His daughter.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.565
I was unsuitable on several levels.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.734
And what's the 42 grand for?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.237
It's a wee bit complicated.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.490
As of yet, I don't actually have a boat.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.956
Sorry, did I say something wrong?

15:19.502 --> 15:20.961
I have a boat.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.844
It was my husband's, but... he got sick.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.891
He wanted to sail to the Mediterranean,
but he never...

15:42.108 --> 15:46.695
He passed away... about a month ago.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.576
I'm sorry.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.667
I want you to have it.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.925
- I can't take your boat, miss.
- But you have to.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.512
He'd want you to.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.567
What was your husband's name?

16:29.572 --> 16:30.739
David.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.742
And what did he name his boat?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.914
Elizabeth.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.710
He named it after me.

16:46.214 --> 16:51.093
Then I thank you, Elizabeth.

16:53.763 --> 16:58.850
And I shall win this race... for love.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.077
Would you excuse us, please?

17:19.622 --> 17:21.623
I'll be at the shore.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.586
Don't even think about it.

18:07.670 --> 18:12.758
It's a trap. A net.
Rousseau's got 'em all over the island.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.927
How the hell would you know that?

18:16.012 --> 18:19.014
I kind of tripped one with Jack.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.851
We ended up... Never mind.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.481
What?

18:27.565 --> 18:29.858
When the doc told me
y'all got caught in a net,

18:29.942 --> 18:34.070
I thought he meant... something else.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.367
And since when did you and Jack
start talking about me?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.308
Did that bird just say my name?

19:05.061 --> 19:10.065
Yeah, it did...
right before it crapped gold.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.746
Sorry, man.
I guess I forgot to load that one.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.957
Want to hand me the mag?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.691
John?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.950
What happened to your face?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.955
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- Hey...

20:09.083 --> 20:11.585
...if you're feeling
a little sorry for yourself,

20:11.669 --> 20:14.880
you may want to have a drink
with your mate from the hatch.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.966
I hear he's a little despondent as well.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.094
- What?
- Oh, that's right.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.890
You weren't there
for the dramatic arrival at the funeral.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.018
I think he's pushed your button
too many times, if you ask me.

20:30.271 --> 20:34.357
- Desmond?
- Yeah, Desmond.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.277
I'm sure you two
have a lot to talk about.

20:52.585 --> 20:57.631
I'm sorry if what I said was confusing,
but I asked Jin to come.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.135
You need someone to translate,

21:02.219 --> 21:05.180
and you need at least two people
who know how to sail.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.643
- Desmond managed by himself.
- And look where he ended up.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.369
You're wasting your time, sister.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.790
I shot myself with that stuff
every nine days for three years.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.381
He's lovely.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.803
Is the... is the father
here on the island?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.513
No.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.140
Nope, he's been gone a long time.

21:49.225 --> 21:53.687
Just sort of walked off the moment
he got a bit scared by the situation.

21:55.022 --> 21:59.067
Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.445
Thought he was doing
what was best for you.

22:02.530 --> 22:06.032
He was doing what was best for him.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.998
How did you find me?

22:55.082 --> 22:57.667
Landlord at your flat
told me you ran here...

22:57.752 --> 23:01.588
- How did you find me?
- I have a lot of money, Desmond.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.468
With money and determination,
you can find anyone.

23:11.348 --> 23:16.311
Did you read your beloved book?
The one you were saving?

23:17.855 --> 23:19.481
Not yet.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.694
I thought you might have read it
while you were away.

23:24.779 --> 23:28.656
I was in prison. Not away.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.744
Why didn't you write to me?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.258
When are you getting married, Pen?

23:51.889 --> 23:54.099
We haven't set a date yet.

23:54.183 --> 23:58.561
- I'll be back in a year.
- What if you were back right now?

23:58.646 --> 24:00.688
I'm going to win this race, Pen.

24:02.525 --> 24:08.321
His race. And in a year, I'll be back.

24:25.548 --> 24:28.091
Desmond, what are you running from?

24:32.930 --> 24:35.682
I have to get my honor back...

24:38.310 --> 24:40.812
...and that's what I'm running to.

24:56.579 --> 25:00.874
So, what did one snowman
say to the other snowman?

25:02.251 --> 25:04.252
Smells like carrots.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.923
- Hello, Desmond.
- Hello, yourself, Box Man.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.013
- Do you mind?
- Oh, I insist.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.102
So you managed
to fix the computer then, did you?

25:22.605 --> 25:24.522
The world's still here, ain't it?

25:24.607 --> 25:27.609
I'm not so sure about that, brother.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.152
Refresh my memory, Desmond.

25:29.236 --> 25:34.616
How long did you say
that you were down there in the hatch?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.243
Three years.

25:37.328 --> 25:41.873
Desmond, what if I told you
that... for all that,

25:41.957 --> 25:45.168
all those years
that you and all the men before you

25:45.252 --> 25:48.463
were down there pushing that button...

25:50.174 --> 25:53.301
What if I told you
it was all for nothing?

25:54.094 --> 25:58.973
I'd ask you how the hell
did you know something like that.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.018
I found another hatch.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.105
Another station on the island.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.358
They called it the Pearl.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.444
And I saw a film there.

26:11.528 --> 26:15.990
An orientation film, and it said
that everything that was happening

26:16.075 --> 26:20.161
in our hatch... wasn't real.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.039
That it was a test.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.086
A psychological experiment.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.089
You're lying.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.854
You want to take a walk?
I'll make the popcorn.

26:46.939 --> 26:50.275
If you're so sure it's not real,

26:50.359 --> 26:53.027
then just stop pushing the button.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.281
Well, I have, except, unfortunately,

26:56.365 --> 26:58.658
someone else decided to start.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.787
So you're gonna sober up.

27:03.831 --> 27:07.292
And we're gonna get
a good night's sleep, and tomorrow,

27:07.376 --> 27:11.671
we're gonna find out what happens
if that button doesn't get pushed.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.734
- Dharma NutraBar?
- No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.069
You serious?

27:57.259 --> 27:58.593
Hey.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.512
You all right?

28:01.597 --> 28:04.766
Yeah, just getting some more firewood.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.559
Not feeling too hot.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.855
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll give you a hand.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.565
Yeah.

28:16.278 --> 28:21.157
Hey, thanks for coming out here,
risking your neck for my boy.

28:23.494 --> 28:27.622
- Live together, die alone, man.
- Yeah.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.591
I don't know what is more disquieting,

29:20.676 --> 29:23.261
the fact that the rest
of the statue is missing,

29:23.345 --> 29:26.097
or that it has four toes.

30:23.906 --> 30:28.493
Eight. Seven. Six.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.578
Five. Four.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.082
One.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.928
- John!
- Neat trick.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.429
John!

30:50.766 --> 30:53.476
John! Can you hear me? Open up!

30:53.560 --> 30:55.102
I hope you're sure about this.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.940
I'm more sure about this
than anything in my entire life.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.318
Don't do this! John!

31:02.402 --> 31:04.695
All right then, Box Man.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.407
We wait.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.376
Are you him?

32:44.004 --> 32:45.129
What?

32:46.632 --> 32:49.800
What did one snowman say to the other?

32:51.219 --> 32:53.304
What are you talking about?

33:02.564 --> 33:04.440
Who are you?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.443
I'm Inman.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.821
Kelvin Inman.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.663
What...?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.456
What happened to my boat?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.002
I found you washed up on the beach.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.839
There was no boat.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.422
What was all that about, then?

34:13.135 --> 34:15.469
Just saving the world.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.360
Not long after
the experiments began, however,

34:32.446 --> 34:36.157
there was... an incident.

34:36.241 --> 34:39.702
And since that time, the following
protocol has been observed.

34:39.786 --> 34:44.748
Every 108 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.585
From the moment the alarm sounds,

34:47.668 --> 34:53.090
you will have four minutes to enter the
code into the micro-computer processor.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.263
How many times you
gonna watch that thing?

34:59.347 --> 35:01.599
Why are there missing parts?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.934
Radzinsky made some edits.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.311
Who's Radzinsky?

35:06.480 --> 35:10.441
- He was my partner.
- What happened to him?

35:10.525 --> 35:13.277
Just make sure you put that back
behind Turn of the Screw

35:13.361 --> 35:14.779
when you're done with it.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.615
Why do you wear that suit?

35:17.699 --> 35:20.951
So I don't get infected out there.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.379
Give yourself a shot of this
every nine days.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.799
You were out there a while
before I found you.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.384
I hope it's not too late.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.392
- John! Open this door!
- Who is he, Box Man?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.812
The man out there pounding on the door.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.314
His name is Mr. Eko.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.317
Why does Mr. Eko carry around
a stick covered in scripture?

35:53.401 --> 35:56.946
- Because he's a priest.
- Open the door, please.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.201
Can you hear me? Open up!

36:02.285 --> 36:04.995
- We locked out a priest?
- John!

36:47.914 --> 36:50.541
Charlie, do you know how
they got the hatch door open?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.960
No, but if you hum it,
I could probably play it.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.796
How did they open it?
The door that says "quarantine."

36:55.881 --> 36:59.383
- They blew it up. Why?
- Charlie, I need your help.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.886
Oh, now I'm back
in your good graces, Father?

37:01.970 --> 37:04.388
Charlie, John has locked me
out of the hatch.

37:04.472 --> 37:08.225
I believe he is doing this because
he is going to stop pushing that button.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.563
And Charlie, I am absolutely certain
that if he is successful,

37:12.647 --> 37:16.150
in 90 minutes
everyone on this island will die.

37:19.905 --> 37:23.157
- All right, I'm in. I'm in.
- Thank you. Come on, quick.

37:26.036 --> 37:30.039
So these Others, you think they're
left over from the Dharma folk?

37:30.123 --> 37:34.418
- I don't know, man.
- My theory? They're aliens.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.589
That's why they use the fake beards.
Their heads, made of plastetic.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.049
Prosthetic, dude.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.676
You can't even spell,
and now you're correcting me?

37:42.761 --> 37:46.305
- What do you think, Freckles?
- Keep moving, we're being followed.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.183
- What?
- Just keep smiling.

37:52.646 --> 37:55.606
There's at least two of them
across the river.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.442
In five seconds,
I'm gonna turn the tables on them.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.362
- Well, wait a second.
- You in?

38:11.456 --> 38:12.748
Hey!

38:20.882 --> 38:22.633
He's getting away.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.645
- He's dead. We have to find the other!
- No.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.147
- I'm going. Sawyer...
- I said no!

38:37.232 --> 38:39.817
Crazy? They'll know we're coming.
He'll warn them.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.403
It doesn't matter if we catch him now.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.702
They've already been warned.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.206
What do you mean, "warned?"

38:57.794 --> 38:59.503
Why don't you tell them, Michael?

38:59.587 --> 39:02.589
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop lying!

39:09.681 --> 39:12.766
- Tell them.
- Tell them what? I...

39:13.435 --> 39:17.187
I know what you're doing, Michael!
Now, tell them the truth!

39:17.272 --> 39:19.106
- Jack.
- Tell them!

39:20.608 --> 39:22.317
It was the only way.

39:26.656 --> 39:27.990
They gave me a list.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.534
What list?

39:32.078 --> 39:34.788
It had your names on it.

39:37.751 --> 39:42.463
I had to bring all four of you back,
or they said I'd never see my son again.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.217
- Who are they?
- It's like I said.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.804
They live in a camp with huts, and...

39:50.889 --> 39:53.182
I swear, that's it.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.601
You let Henry go?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.818
Did you kill them?

40:05.528 --> 40:09.656
Ana Lucia... and Libby.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.079
Did you?

40:16.998 --> 40:18.957
I had to.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.798
I couldn't find any other way,
and Libby was a mistake.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.717
I didn't have time to think.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.138
But if you did have time...

40:39.020 --> 40:41.146
...you still would've killed her, right?

40:42.190 --> 40:44.233
I'm sorry.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.737
You understand, I am sorry.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.864
I'm sorry.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.410
I... It's my son.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.460
I'm going back.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.296
No, Hurley.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.466
Hurley, you can't.

41:12.178 --> 41:15.139
We're gonna get killed.
You knew it and let us come anyway.

41:15.223 --> 41:19.143
It's too late to go back now, Hurley.
We caught them following us once.

41:19.227 --> 41:22.062
If they don't believe we trust Michael,
they'll kill us.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.067
I'm sorry that I didn't say anything.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.321
You have to know
that I would never bring you out here

41:31.406 --> 41:32.990
if I didn't have a plan!

41:35.160 --> 41:37.119
What plan?

42:10.069 --> 42:11.653
Sayid!

42:17.410 --> 42:19.119
There.

42:20.622 --> 42:23.123
That's the rock Michael described.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.127
We're here.
