00:15.044 --> 00:17.294
(swishing)

00:20.368 --> 00:22.080
- Well, I can tell you a funny story.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.360
I was in, uh, I was
with some family friends

00:26.360 --> 00:29.850
and we were doing one of
those obstacle courses

00:29.850 --> 00:31.530
that you like go on and you have

00:31.530 --> 00:33.270
to harness yourself to everything

00:33.270 --> 00:37.470
and they were older than me, so they, um,

00:37.470 --> 00:38.960
they wanted to go on the black course,

00:38.960 --> 00:42.420
so I was just like, okay,
I'm gonna hold my own,

00:42.420 --> 00:44.650
and it was like a three-hour thing

00:44.650 --> 00:47.540
and we're like, holding on for dear life

00:47.540 --> 00:51.700
like on logs and going
zip-lining into nets

00:51.700 --> 00:54.480
and like this whole crazy thing,

00:54.480 --> 00:57.180
and, finally, we're
getting to the last stretch

00:57.180 --> 01:00.170
where you just have to
zip-line into a net and then,

01:00.170 --> 01:05.170
like, harness yourself on
and then slowly go down,

01:05.250 --> 01:09.640
so I went, landed perfectly, um,

01:09.640 --> 01:12.750
and there I harnessed myself a little bit,

01:12.750 --> 01:16.130
then I, I go down and
then I un-harness myself

01:16.130 --> 01:19.050
so that I can just, you know, walk down,

01:19.050 --> 01:21.870
and all of a sudden I see my friend,

01:21.870 --> 01:26.120
he was a big guy, come
zip-lining into the net

01:26.120 --> 01:30.450
and I'm still in the
net, and so he crashes,

01:30.450 --> 01:35.450
I go flying in the air, land
flat on my face in the gravel.

01:37.359 --> 01:39.550
(laughing)

01:39.550 --> 01:41.830
Oh, it was just so funny now,

01:41.830 --> 01:44.093
but at the time, it was really painful.

01:48.766 --> 01:50.933
(beeping)

01:54.762 --> 01:57.345
(gentle music)

02:05.827 --> 02:07.577
- [Saam] Who are you?

02:10.705 --> 02:12.623
- [Woman] I'm a person.

02:14.249 --> 02:15.916
- [Saam] That's all?

02:16.835 --> 02:18.400
- I don't know.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.763
I was born in London.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.310
Who are you?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.093
- It's my turn to ask questions.

02:33.890 --> 02:36.684
- [Woman] Fine, so what's the question?

02:36.684 --> 02:39.767
- [Saam] The question is who are you?

02:43.307 --> 02:44.823
- It's a dumb question.

02:46.990 --> 02:47.823
- Okay.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.950
Do you think you're attractive?

03:01.310 --> 03:02.143
- Yes.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.340
- [Saam] Are you smart?

03:11.866 --> 03:13.033
- [Woman] Yes.

03:15.858 --> 03:17.275
- Are you sexual?

03:20.380 --> 03:21.213
- Yes.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.030
- Are you scared of dying?

03:34.150 --> 03:35.300
- [Woman] I'm not sure.

03:36.430 --> 03:37.923
- [Saam] What's your favorite color?

03:44.950 --> 03:45.783
- Yellow?

03:51.550 --> 03:55.373
- [Saam] Why was who are
you such a dumb question?

04:02.220 --> 04:03.970
- Because it doesn't mean anything.

04:07.710 --> 04:08.543
Who am I?

04:09.500 --> 04:13.430
I'm Ashley, I'm a frog, I
was born in London, so what?

04:17.291 --> 04:18.124
- Okay.

04:22.905 --> 04:24.155
- You're weird.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.535
- [Saam] And so are you.

04:36.647 --> 04:37.897
- [Woman] Yeah.

04:54.174 --> 04:57.007
(vehicle honking)

05:45.004 --> 05:47.921
(electric buzzing)

06:44.400 --> 06:47.373
- [Therapist] Saam, you need
to start taking your meds.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.163
- I don't wanna do drugs.

06:54.657 --> 06:58.497
I mean, I feel like I'm already
on drugs, what's the point?

06:58.497 --> 06:59.590
- I mean, listen, what can I say?

06:59.590 --> 07:00.760
You know, I'm not a proponent

07:00.760 --> 07:04.853
of taking drugs for
the sake of themselves.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.720
I just feel like in conjunction
with what we're trying

07:09.720 --> 07:11.853
to do here, it would really work.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.540
I think you're being stubborn,

07:15.390 --> 07:18.940
and that your ego is
putting up all these walls.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.420
Let me put it this way,
if you keep repeating

07:21.420 --> 07:24.020
the same behaviors that got you into this,

07:24.020 --> 07:26.620
how do you expect to have any progress?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.420
- You're gonna quote Einstein now?

07:28.420 --> 07:29.810
- Einstein didn't say that.

07:32.470 --> 07:35.640
Actually Einstein said, how
can we solve our problems

07:35.640 --> 07:38.220
with the same level of
thinking that created them?

07:38.220 --> 07:39.630
- It's the same shit.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.333
It's exactly the same meaning.

07:43.490 --> 07:46.713
All right, okay, I'm being
an asshole, all right.

07:54.410 --> 07:57.403
I don't, um,

07:58.520 --> 07:59.793
I don't feel like myself.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.353
I don't feel comfortable these days.

08:08.499 --> 08:10.633
I have a hard time breathing.

08:10.633 --> 08:13.500
I keep thinking about
breathing when I sleep.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.140
I mean, how long have we been doing this?

08:16.140 --> 08:17.340
- Therapy?

08:17.340 --> 08:18.990
My friend, we're not doing therapy.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.853
We are listening to our expression,

08:24.220 --> 08:26.940
and I think it's important
to not get hung up on time.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.170
- Get hung up on time, money
is coming out of my pocket

08:30.170 --> 08:33.600
into your pocket, all right,
there's a transaction here.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.663
Would you be here for me for free?

08:40.450 --> 08:42.220
- If it was something that was absolutely

08:42.220 --> 08:44.773
necessary, yes, I would.

08:53.110 --> 08:53.943
Okay, you know what?

08:53.943 --> 08:58.870
I, uh, I gotta get going
because I have a three o'clock.

09:08.971 --> 09:09.937
You know, I didn't talk about this,

09:09.937 --> 09:12.573
but I think that this might help you.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.793
I don't know, just read
it and see what you think.

09:33.630 --> 09:34.880
- I wanna have five kids.

09:40.590 --> 09:41.703
- Who's the lucky guy?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.249
(laughing)

09:50.540 --> 09:52.040
'Cause that's not gonna be me.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.193
Are you mad?

10:32.650 --> 10:34.540
If I spin this and it goes to you,

10:34.540 --> 10:37.130
it means you're mad, okay?

10:37.130 --> 10:39.010
If it goes to me, it means

10:39.010 --> 10:42.927
that I can certainly draw better than you.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.240
- You cheated somehow.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.831
(sighs)

11:23.894 --> 11:26.061
(humming)

11:52.306 --> 11:54.077
- [Woman On TV] I've been
having way too many pills.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.292
- [Woman On TV] Really?

11:55.292 --> 11:57.746
- [Woman On TV] People have
stopped bending towards me.

11:57.746 --> 12:00.413
And then so they get thrown out.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.431
- [Saam] Come here.

12:04.431 --> 12:05.264
- Stop.

12:05.264 --> 12:06.097
- Come here!

12:06.097 --> 12:07.458
- No, stop, ow, you're hurting me!

12:07.458 --> 12:08.291
- I'm not, what?

12:08.291 --> 12:09.840
- Yeah you are, you're pinching my back.

12:11.694 --> 12:12.694
- Oh my god.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.203
- Oh my gosh!

12:22.725 --> 12:23.600
- [Saam] Come here.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.593
- Stop, Saam!

12:26.784 --> 12:27.617
- Come here.

12:27.617 --> 12:29.280
- Stop, seriously, I'm trying to watch.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.113
Okay?

12:31.098 --> 12:34.181
(woman on TV laughs)

12:40.666 --> 12:45.666
(static crackling)
(mournful music)

13:48.903 --> 13:51.470
- [Tom] Take the fucking job, man.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.230
- [Saam] Why am I getting
the same bullshit gigs

13:53.230 --> 13:54.823
over and over again with you?

13:56.470 --> 13:58.556
- 'Cause that's what it is.

13:58.556 --> 13:59.389
- [Saam] Mm-hm.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.910
- All this shit's just
to roll the dice, man!

14:02.910 --> 14:05.920
Nobody's more talented than anybody else.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.513
I live in fucking reality!

14:10.430 --> 14:11.880
- [Saam] What's reality, Tom?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.870
- Listen, Saam, I'm not going

14:14.870 --> 14:16.680
to get into some psychological debate

14:16.680 --> 14:18.890
on the nature of reality.

14:18.890 --> 14:20.223
I want what you want.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.193
I wanna fuck.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.563
I want money.

14:28.490 --> 14:32.363
I wanna eat goddamn sushi whenever I want.

14:34.010 --> 14:39.010
This isn't about Fukushima or ISIS,

14:41.700 --> 14:46.413
saving the whales, goddamn
two-state solution.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.773
I wanna eat pussy whenever I want.

14:54.270 --> 14:59.050
You think that's vulgar or
that I don't have morals?

14:59.050 --> 15:03.623
Nah, man, that's life, that's reality.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.553
- Bravo, that's what you think I want?

15:10.630 --> 15:13.293
- [Tom] It is what you want,
you just don't know it yet.

15:14.250 --> 15:18.040
- You're an asshole, Tom, I
got in with the wrong partner.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.740
You are the wrong person for me.

15:19.740 --> 15:20.890
- See, that's what you think,

15:20.890 --> 15:22.020
that's what you tell yourself.

15:22.020 --> 15:25.170
Look where you're at, this
is Holly-fucking-wood, bro!

15:25.170 --> 15:27.990
You think they built that
on some Godard bullshit?

15:27.990 --> 15:29.630
Some Kurosawa fuckery?

15:29.630 --> 15:31.063
Mm-mm, look,

15:33.190 --> 15:35.060
this is you, this is it,

15:35.060 --> 15:37.170
this is you getting over it.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.313
This is you, this is you,
this is you getting over you.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.030
- I can kick your head in, all right?

15:45.030 --> 15:47.150
Always keep that in the
back of your fucking mind,

15:47.150 --> 15:48.410
all right?

15:48.410 --> 15:51.363
- Yeah, yeah, no, I know,
you're real buff, man.

15:55.220 --> 15:58.460
God, I hate this shit, took
a fucking bullshit meeting

15:58.460 --> 16:02.320
like this, fucking ad company dick sucks,

16:02.320 --> 16:06.113
fucking client, fucking talent!

16:07.500 --> 16:10.880
Let me tell ya, had to do this over again,

16:10.880 --> 16:14.643
I'd go into tech, design
apps, make real fucking money.

16:14.643 --> 16:16.680
- What is this, some reverse psychology?

16:16.680 --> 16:20.260
- Stop being a baby and take the job,

16:20.260 --> 16:23.830
the money, this isn't
gonna last forever, man,

16:23.830 --> 16:25.773
small windows close real quick.

16:28.190 --> 16:29.950
Take the job, Saam.

16:29.950 --> 16:30.830
- I'll think about it.

16:30.830 --> 16:32.070
- [Tom] I beg you.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.640
- I'll think about it, all right?

16:33.640 --> 16:34.523
I have to go.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.330
- So, a week from today.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.273
- Take a nice swim, ah, Jesus Christ.

16:46.010 --> 16:47.473
- Always a pleasure, Saam!

16:49.070 --> 16:51.700
Take the fucking job!

16:51.700 --> 16:54.450
(birds chirping)

17:58.257 --> 17:59.915
- [Director] Quiet on the set!

17:59.915 --> 18:00.998
Quiet please!

18:02.128 --> 18:03.633
Sound speed.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.879
- [Camera Man] Opening up.

18:05.879 --> 18:08.105
You can hear that a lot.

18:08.105 --> 18:09.083
- There a signal?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.750
- Yeah, still going.

18:11.622 --> 18:12.537
- Ready now?

18:12.537 --> 18:13.707
- [Director] Yes.

18:13.707 --> 18:16.290
(gentle music)

18:30.346 --> 18:31.429
Okay, action.

18:34.843 --> 18:36.202
- [Man] Guys.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.641
Stand one, pull it back for her.

18:38.641 --> 18:41.724
(indistinct talking)

19:16.341 --> 19:19.091
(dramatic music)

19:32.522 --> 19:36.689
- [Man] Yup, all right,
we got something at least.

19:40.567 --> 19:41.952
- [Woman] Yeah, let's get her,

19:41.952 --> 19:43.858
let's get her feet.

19:43.858 --> 19:46.516
Just like walking shots.

19:46.516 --> 19:49.266
(dramatic music)

20:07.697 --> 20:09.197
- [Man] Let me just get focus.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.696
(indistinct talking)

20:28.506 --> 20:31.923
Tuck all the way in, tuck all the way in!

20:34.043 --> 20:34.876
Action!

20:52.077 --> 20:54.827
(dramatic music)

21:22.084 --> 21:25.167
(indistinct talking)

21:47.841 --> 21:50.091
(clinking)

22:05.034 --> 22:07.367
- Shit.
- Hi, is Danica home?

22:09.743 --> 22:11.445
Hello.
- Saam, this is Zorana.

22:11.445 --> 22:12.911
Zorana, this is Saam.

22:12.911 --> 22:14.475
- Nice to meet you, Zorana.
- Sorry.

22:14.475 --> 22:15.397
- No, it's okay.

22:15.397 --> 22:18.856
You, uh, just paying
tribute, having some fun?

22:18.856 --> 22:20.561
- What do you mean?

22:20.561 --> 22:25.561
- I don't mean anything.

22:53.262 --> 22:54.280
It was nice meeting you.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.113
- Yes.

23:00.759 --> 23:04.676
(speaking in foreign language)

23:08.626 --> 23:10.280
- She's only here for a month or so.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.898
- Isn't she gonna mess with your business?

23:11.898 --> 23:13.320
- No, it won't be any trouble.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.120
You want?
- She seems nice, though.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.393
Same business?

23:25.195 --> 23:27.945
(dramatic music)

23:37.396 --> 23:40.396
(people chattering)

23:48.624 --> 23:51.388
- [Woman] Happy Birthday, To Me!

23:51.388 --> 23:56.388
- And all my friends, I got (mumbles)

23:56.547 --> 24:00.464
(speaking in foreign language)

24:01.561 --> 24:04.398
And it's a good time to be here.

24:04.398 --> 24:06.311
And everybody wins.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.061
(dramatic music)

24:11.000 --> 24:13.230
- I would really get into
watching like pro-wrestling.

24:13.230 --> 24:14.680
That was my shit.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.370
Saturday comes around, I'm
waking up seven o'clock sharp.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.340
I got my Saturday morning cartoons on.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.250
I got my punch, my lemonade.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.380
I'm chilling.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.930
And then 12 o'clock my freakin'
wrestling show would come in

24:24.930 --> 24:26.750
and once Soul Train goes on that means

24:26.750 --> 24:28.550
then Saturday morning is finished.

24:28.550 --> 24:33.257
First of all, wrestling
was a really bad influence.

24:33.257 --> 24:34.090
(bell dinging)
Let me just get that

24:34.090 --> 24:34.923
out of the way.

24:36.620 --> 24:39.690
It was, um, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause,

24:39.690 --> 24:43.713
me and my brother would really
like try and do that stuff.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.010
We would, actually, like I'm not kidding.

24:47.010 --> 24:47.843
I remember one time my brother

24:47.843 --> 24:50.570
freakin' power-dropped me in
the freakin' marble floor.

24:52.410 --> 24:54.363
We made home videos of us wrestling.

24:55.772 --> 24:57.172
And, looking back at it now,

24:59.550 --> 25:01.610
it could have been
worse than how it ended.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.860
Actually, we were lucky
that nothing happened

25:05.600 --> 25:07.990
because like a lot of
that stuff we were doing,

25:07.990 --> 25:09.040
we were really doing.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.880
Like, but since I was
really young, you know,

25:14.880 --> 25:17.790
like I was really
punching them or whatever,

25:17.790 --> 25:19.060
but it wasn't really
hurting them that much

25:19.060 --> 25:20.350
because the people I was wrestling with

25:20.350 --> 25:22.508
were like freakin' 10 years older than me.

25:22.508 --> 25:23.510
You know, I was like freakin' 10.

25:23.510 --> 25:24.710
They were like 16, 17.

25:24.710 --> 25:26.720
I was freakin' wrestling
with high school kids, okay.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.900
Let's be honest here.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.580
And a lot it, we would
script out the punches.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.980
We'd make the punches look fake on purpose

25:32.980 --> 25:34.080
'cause we wanted to make it look

25:34.080 --> 25:36.630
like a real professional wrestling match.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.340
We'd like to slam, jump off the bed,

25:38.340 --> 25:41.700
and my brother would really
like double knee-drop me.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.620
It was like a freakin' psycho.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.650
I didn't know what the freak was going on.

25:44.650 --> 25:46.860
Like he would really
jump off the freakin' bed

25:46.860 --> 25:49.100
and he would come down
on me with both knees

25:49.100 --> 25:51.710
and he wouldn't even block,
he wouldn't do anything.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.150
He would just, knees.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.930
And then we're putting it on film.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.110
I remember my brother and my dad saw that.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.860
He saw that stuff, dude.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.230
And I was still like the same age,

26:00.230 --> 26:01.590
like at the same time, not like recently,

26:01.590 --> 26:02.740
but like at that time.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.720
He actually saw that tape
and I just remember him

26:04.720 --> 26:08.440
yelling at my brother, like in Farsi too.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.880
Like every single bad
word you could imagine.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.660
He would just be, and my brother
and my mom would be like,

26:13.660 --> 26:15.620
is no big deal, they're just playing.

26:15.620 --> 26:16.830
They're just playing.

26:16.830 --> 26:19.130
And then my brother and my dad
would like rewind the tape.

26:19.130 --> 26:21.453
He'd be like, is this playing?

26:22.403 --> 26:24.533
Is this playing?

26:24.533 --> 26:27.590
He's freakin', he's slamming
his head against the ground.

26:27.590 --> 26:28.570
Is that playing?

26:29.710 --> 26:30.910
But, no, my dad was upset.

26:30.910 --> 26:32.600
Like he was pissed.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.590
First of all, he was mad that we did it.

26:33.590 --> 26:35.740
Then he was more mad
that we showed him it.

26:36.950 --> 26:37.783
So, we showed him it.

26:37.783 --> 26:39.950
We were like, dad, look what we did!

26:39.950 --> 26:41.590
You think WWF is cool, check this out.

26:41.590 --> 26:45.453
We put in the tape, freakin'
dad was like wigging out.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.530
He was like, are you guys crazy?

26:48.530 --> 26:49.943
You could break his neck.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.200
He's like, but now, now that I'm older,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.530
now, I'm looking at it now,

26:56.530 --> 26:58.510
I'm thinking about it now, at this age,

26:58.510 --> 27:00.270
and I'm thinking, damn,
he was freakin' right.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.720
What the freak were we doing?

27:03.490 --> 27:05.600
Like that was just high-risk.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.430
And there was no springboard mat.

27:07.430 --> 27:09.470
Like we were doing it all on the floor

27:09.470 --> 27:11.083
and, yeah, that was pretty bad.

27:13.420 --> 27:16.590
Basically, it all started when we started

27:16.590 --> 27:18.170
videotaping us wrestling.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.430
That's where it all started,

27:19.430 --> 27:21.590
to do our own home movies
'cause we were old enough

27:21.590 --> 27:22.813
to actually take control of the camera

27:22.813 --> 27:25.517
because my dad had like this
big camera with a VCR camera.

27:25.517 --> 27:27.090
It was like over the head.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.290
You had to like put it over your shoulder

27:28.290 --> 27:29.520
to hold it steady.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.660
So, we were old enough to
handle it at this point.

27:31.660 --> 27:32.860
I was like 10.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.500
I was also into horror movies.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.000
And so, my brother actually
came up with the idea

27:37.000 --> 27:39.380
to let's make our own little fun movie

27:39.380 --> 27:41.130
and watch it and have a good laugh.

27:41.130 --> 27:45.880
And so, we did, we're like
let's do one about Halloween.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.210
But, at this time, like how
we're gonna do Halloween?

27:48.210 --> 27:49.490
We don't have Michael Myers' masks.

27:49.490 --> 27:51.570
We had to go with the supplies we had.

27:51.570 --> 27:55.000
So, we're like, well, what
about Friday the 13th?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.270
I have a mask for that.

27:57.270 --> 27:58.750
Oh yeah, that's the thing!

27:58.750 --> 28:02.250
The funny thing is we were
making a movie, Friday the 13th,

28:02.250 --> 28:05.090
and they had me playing the role of Jason.

28:05.090 --> 28:09.893
Like a short, four-foot guy
who's like a 10-year-old kid.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.750
But the thing is, though, we kinda,

28:12.750 --> 28:13.760
we were thinking outside of the box.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.550
This was Jason in the beginning.

28:15.550 --> 28:17.300
Like, you know, when he
got drowned as a kid?

28:17.300 --> 28:19.230
So, this was supposed to be

28:19.230 --> 28:22.740
like the young Jason, I guess
because we also made a sequel

28:22.740 --> 28:24.160
which we ended up losing that tape.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.050
But that's when Jason
got bigger or whatever.

28:26.050 --> 28:27.810
So, anyway, so I was playing the Jason.

28:27.810 --> 28:29.010
He put a little shirt over my head

28:29.010 --> 28:29.943
to make it look like I'm bald

28:29.943 --> 28:31.960
because you know Jason
didn't have hair or whatever.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.030
It's like all skin.

28:33.030 --> 28:34.200
So they had to put the mask on me

28:34.200 --> 28:35.975
and made me do this Jason thing.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.470
It was like my brother was
directing the whole thing.

28:37.470 --> 28:39.010
He was like you're gonna be laying here.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.730
Oh, I even conducted the music!

28:40.730 --> 28:42.940
I was on the piano and started to play

28:42.940 --> 28:46.960
like some dark intro thing for this movie

28:46.960 --> 28:48.710
and we just kind of did it like ourselves

28:48.710 --> 28:50.510
and my brother was like narrating it.

28:50.510 --> 28:52.190
He was like Jason and Irvine.

28:52.190 --> 28:55.400
It was like what the freakin',
Jason takes over Irvine.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.980
'Cause, at the time, there was a movie

28:56.980 --> 28:59.370
called Jason takes Manhattan came out.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.920
So, we kinda parodied that.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.850
At the time, we weren't
thinking it was a parody.

29:03.850 --> 29:05.840
But now, looking back
at it, it was a parody.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.680
You know, Jason takes Manhattan.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.803
Jason terrorizes Irvine, you know?

29:12.211 --> 29:13.361
It was kinda like that.

29:15.774 --> 29:18.024
(groaning)

29:30.374 --> 29:32.124
- [Boy] Anybody home?

29:37.523 --> 29:40.273
(toy gun firing)

29:45.312 --> 29:47.562
(groaning)

29:55.829 --> 29:57.746
- [Boy] That's Johnson.

29:59.329 --> 30:01.079
- You killed Johnson?

30:01.921 --> 30:04.671
(toy gun firing)

30:16.489 --> 30:17.739
- I'll be back.

30:19.104 --> 30:22.104
(suspenseful music)

30:36.460 --> 30:37.910
- [Saam] What's reality, Tom?

30:39.319 --> 30:41.220
- Listen, Saam, I'm not going to get into

30:41.220 --> 30:44.900
some psychological debates
on the nature of reality.

30:44.900 --> 30:45.877
I want what you want.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.377
You just don't know it yet.

30:50.887 --> 30:52.660
(film whirring)

30:52.660 --> 30:53.637
I want what you want.

30:53.637 --> 30:55.177
You just don't know it yet.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.163
- Okay, that's the part we're gonna cut.

31:05.915 --> 31:07.023
I think this will work.

31:12.207 --> 31:13.857
Ah, this is lagging a little bit.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.350
Avid's so much easier to use.

31:41.205 --> 31:43.955
(violin humming)

31:55.712 --> 31:57.079
The orchestra would hit like that.

31:57.079 --> 31:57.912
Zoom!

32:03.380 --> 32:05.270
Some filmmakers have this idea

32:05.270 --> 32:07.590
that, if you rely too much on music,

32:07.590 --> 32:09.610
you're not doing your job as a filmmaker

32:09.610 --> 32:12.350
'cause you're trying to
manipulate the audience.

32:12.350 --> 32:14.730
And, you know, that's
certainly a fair point

32:14.730 --> 32:16.260
and it depends on what
kind of movie you're making

32:16.260 --> 32:18.220
and, sometimes, you don't want that.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.170
But music is one of your tools,

32:20.170 --> 32:23.240
like as a filmmaker you're
manipulating the audience.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.100
That just kinda goes without saying.

32:25.100 --> 32:25.970
Even if you're trying to make

32:25.970 --> 32:30.340
like a hard-edged, you know,
verite, just filming life,

32:30.340 --> 32:31.740
you're still manipulating the audience

32:31.740 --> 32:34.243
by what you're showing them.

32:34.243 --> 32:37.576
(dramatic violin music)

35:14.748 --> 35:17.665
(kettle whistling)

35:18.657 --> 35:21.420
- Why would you say something so crass?

35:21.420 --> 35:22.420
- [Danica] Say what?

35:23.540 --> 35:25.560
- About sucking me off.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.003
- [Danica] I like dick,
it's something I enjoy.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.600
- Yeah, but that's not the only reason

35:31.600 --> 35:32.830
I came over here, okay?

35:32.830 --> 35:33.980
- [Danica] You don't have to say

35:33.980 --> 35:35.927
something to mean something.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.340
- You ever seen Hedgehog in the Fog?

35:40.340 --> 35:41.543
- No, what's that?

35:43.050 --> 35:44.431
- It's an animated movie.

35:44.431 --> 35:45.778
- No.

35:45.778 --> 35:47.010
- I thought all you Russians had seen it.

35:47.010 --> 35:48.743
- I'm Serbian, asshole.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.710
- Same difference.

36:10.397 --> 36:11.230
Hold on.

36:13.470 --> 36:15.140
We're just friends hanging out.

36:15.140 --> 36:15.973
- This is friends.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.190
- This is not friends.

36:17.190 --> 36:18.330
No.
- I'm sorry.

36:18.330 --> 36:20.230
- This is not friends, right.
- Okay.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.720
What do you want me to
do, tell your fortune?

36:23.720 --> 36:25.996
- Yeah, actually, that sounds good.

36:25.996 --> 36:26.829
- Okay.

36:30.340 --> 36:31.973
This is your lifeline.
- Mm-hm.

36:33.090 --> 36:33.923
- So, here.

36:34.764 --> 36:37.020
You're going to die.

36:37.020 --> 36:37.970
- Okay.

36:37.970 --> 36:38.920
- Today.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.943
The cross here,

36:40.880 --> 36:41.713
explosion.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.120
It's an explosion.

36:44.120 --> 36:44.953
- Mm-hm.

36:45.968 --> 36:46.947
- You'd like to have a blow job.

36:46.947 --> 36:48.044
- Okay, all right.
- You'd like to have

36:48.044 --> 36:49.260
a blow job.

36:49.260 --> 36:51.227
- Yeah.
Hold on, hold on.

36:51.227 --> 36:52.622
Do you understand, hold on,

36:52.622 --> 36:54.960
do you understand the
concept of friendship?

36:54.960 --> 36:55.793
- Yeah, this is friends.

36:55.793 --> 36:57.370
- No, this is not friends, okay?

36:57.370 --> 37:00.080
I don't go and grab my
friends fucking tits

37:00.080 --> 37:01.210
out of nowhere, right?

37:01.210 --> 37:03.530
I don't say, hey Kevin, I
want to suck your fat cock.

37:03.530 --> 37:05.523
That's not friends here, all right?

37:06.400 --> 37:08.042
You understand?

37:08.042 --> 37:09.744
- I'm sorry.

37:09.744 --> 37:11.938
- [Saam] There's nothing
to be sorry about.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.021
- What, what do you want?

37:21.860 --> 37:22.693
Okay.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.470
- Listen, come here.
- No!

37:26.470 --> 37:27.480
No!
- Come here!

37:27.480 --> 37:28.570
- Why?

37:28.570 --> 37:30.520
- Come here, I wanna hang out with you.

49:33.323 --> 49:36.173

Dianna from high school?

49:36.173 --> 49:39.195
(laughing)

49:39.195 --> 49:41.543
- [Robert] I always wanted to fuck her.

49:41.543 --> 49:42.522
- Oh, you know what?

49:42.522 --> 49:44.746
I always wanted to fuck Dianna's sister.

49:44.746 --> 49:46.136

49:46.136 --> 49:47.981

49:52.110 --> 49:53.900
- Of course you would.

49:53.900 --> 49:55.740
- Oh, you are a vile creature, Robert.

49:55.740 --> 49:57.040
- Aye, come on, bro.

49:57.040 --> 49:57.940
You'd fuck it too.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.050
- No, I would not.

50:00.050 --> 50:00.930

50:00.930 --> 50:02.113
Couple beers deep, bro.

50:03.614 --> 50:05.364
- You could have my sloppy seconds.

50:06.636 --> 50:08.650
- Aye, whatever happened to Spencer?

50:08.650 --> 50:10.430
- Who?
- Blonde kid, short hair.

50:10.430 --> 50:11.370
Real fucking jerk.

50:11.370 --> 50:13.490
The kid I knocked out at Carl's Junior.

50:13.490 --> 50:15.669
- Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that guy.

50:15.669 --> 50:17.237
- Yeah.

50:17.237 --> 50:18.070
Yeah.

50:18.070 --> 50:20.480
Why you thinking about that, dude?

50:20.480 --> 50:21.480
- I don't know, man.

50:22.843 --> 50:25.410
I guess I just wanted to say I was sorry.

50:25.410 --> 50:27.080
- Sorry for kicking his ass?

50:27.080 --> 50:28.441
- Yeah.

50:28.441 --> 50:29.274
Felt bad.

50:31.510 --> 50:33.890
- Why don't you look him up
on Facebook or something?

50:33.890 --> 50:36.470
- Yeah.
- Facebook, nah man.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.250
That's for fucking faggots like this guy

50:38.250 --> 50:39.856
updating all the time.

50:39.856 --> 50:43.090
Doo-doo-doo, just took
a shower, hashtag clean.

50:43.090 --> 50:44.200
- Very clever, man.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.230
- Either that or take a selfie.

50:45.230 --> 50:46.123
- Yeah!

50:47.703 --> 50:48.730
- So cute.

50:48.730 --> 50:50.900
I'm not even online anymore.

50:50.900 --> 50:52.000
- Yeah, whatever, bro.

50:54.430 --> 50:57.010
- Dude, I kid you not,
we had this conversation

50:57.010 --> 50:58.747
like three days ago.

50:59.582 --> 51:00.567
- What the fuck are
you talking about, man?

51:00.567 --> 51:02.130
- [Saam] No, we didn't.

51:02.130 --> 51:04.260
- We've already done this.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.560
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, I'm having a,

51:06.560 --> 51:08.070
what's that called?

51:08.070 --> 51:09.512
Deja vu.

51:09.512 --> 51:10.345
- What?
- Oh man.

51:10.345 --> 51:13.563
- Yeah, like this moment
has already happened.

51:13.563 --> 51:14.650
- [Robert] You're a pothead, man.

51:14.650 --> 51:17.330
- No, it's exactly the same way.

51:17.330 --> 51:18.890
- No, you're sounding
like Robert's fucking

51:18.890 --> 51:20.263
ghost stories over here.

51:22.804 --> 51:25.057
- You guys don't believe in ghosts?

51:25.057 --> 51:27.150
- No, I don't believe in ghosts, man.

51:27.150 --> 51:29.490
- Wait till that shit
happens to you one day.

51:29.490 --> 51:30.870
- Oh!

51:30.870 --> 51:31.703
What happens?

51:31.703 --> 51:33.108
- Don't be scured.

51:33.108 --> 51:34.811
- Wait till the demons come for you, man.

51:34.811 --> 51:36.490
In the middle of the night,
bro, just fucking wait.

51:36.490 --> 51:37.800
You'll fucking know what's up.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.710
- Oh!
- Threats over here.

51:39.710 --> 51:41.830
- Yeah.
- Demons.

51:41.830 --> 51:44.830
- But the ghost ain't got this, son!

51:44.830 --> 51:47.590
- What kind of demons we
talking about, Robert?

51:47.590 --> 51:48.990
- Just fucking wait, man.

51:48.990 --> 51:49.940
Demons, shadow spears, man.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.820
That's shit no fucking joke.

51:51.820 --> 51:52.653
- What happens?

51:52.653 --> 51:53.990
- You don't want any part

51:53.990 --> 51:55.303
of that fucking shit, man.
- What's the part?

51:55.303 --> 51:56.692
What happens though?

51:56.692 --> 51:57.525
Why don't you explain it to me?

51:57.525 --> 51:59.250
- Well, you wake up in the
middle of the fucking night,

51:59.250 --> 52:01.300
fucking something standing over your bed.

52:02.389 --> 52:05.172
- He left out the part where
they come in their spaceship.

52:05.172 --> 52:07.625
- What do they do, come fondle you?

52:07.625 --> 52:09.525
- Yeah, I've seen UFOs too, man.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.173
- They finger him at night.

52:15.420 --> 52:17.303
- As long as they clean up afterwards.

52:18.860 --> 52:21.667
- All right man, here's
to your frickin' ghosts.

52:21.667 --> 52:22.500
- Shots!

52:26.542 --> 52:28.933
- This shit fucks you up.

52:28.933 --> 52:31.016
- This shit fucks you up.

52:32.518 --> 52:34.182
Stupid fool.

52:34.182 --> 52:35.617
- Okay, drunkie.

52:35.617 --> 52:36.789
- Why you such a fool, man?

52:36.789 --> 52:39.464
- I'm down with whiskey, son.

52:39.464 --> 52:41.537
- All right, cheers to the ghost.

52:41.537 --> 52:43.855
- [Both] The ghost!

52:43.855 --> 52:46.605
(dramatic music)

53:20.992 --> 53:22.719
- You talking to me?

53:22.719 --> 53:24.317
Huh?

53:24.317 --> 53:25.817
You know who I am?

53:27.632 --> 53:29.132
You know who I am?

53:30.314 --> 53:32.231
You know what I can do?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.223
You talking to me?

53:37.144 --> 53:41.070
You must be talking to me
'cause there's nobody else here.

53:49.068 --> 53:51.651

54:23.345 --> 54:26.095
(dramatic music)

01:00:43.508 --> 01:00:45.228
- [Boy] Hey!

01:00:45.228 --> 01:00:47.728
Oh no, something's gone wrong!

01:00:56.956 --> 01:00:58.706
What's going on here?

01:01:30.872 --> 01:01:33.539
(boys shouting)

01:01:41.845 --> 01:01:44.428
(upbeat music)

01:01:49.784 --> 01:01:51.674
- [Boy] Mom, they're doing the same thing

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.692
I was doing on my birthday!

01:01:53.692 --> 01:01:54.784
- [Boy] Yeah right!

01:01:54.784 --> 01:01:56.906
- [Boy] Yeah, I had the punk rocker!

01:01:56.906 --> 01:01:59.406
And it'd go I'm a punk rocker!

01:02:00.398 --> 01:02:03.258
The one that you gave me.

01:02:03.258 --> 01:02:06.258
(people chattering)

01:02:17.295 --> 01:02:18.951
Hey!

01:02:18.951 --> 01:02:21.451
Oh no, something's gone wrong!

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.420
What's going on here?

01:02:48.092 --> 01:02:48.925
Not bad.

01:02:50.597 --> 01:02:52.514
I'm having a good time.

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:56.219
(dramatic music)

01:03:02.598 --> 01:03:05.598
- [Man] You know what this is about?

01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:09.894
- [Saam] Yes.

01:03:11.123 --> 01:03:13.706
- [Man] This is your last time.
This is your last time to backdown.

01:03:16.628 --> 01:03:17.897
- I understand.

01:03:17.897 --> 01:03:18.747
- [Man] You sure?

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:21.383
- Yes.

01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:26.137
- Things will never be the same.

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:28.152
- [Saam] I understand.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:29.739
- [Man] Okay then.

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:34.739
Congratulation yourself,
welcome to the team.

01:03:41.787 --> 01:03:43.620
Go ahead and lie down, please.

01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:03.751
(dramatic music)

01:04:29.046 --> 01:04:31.460
- I wanna grab a drink tonight.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.583
- [Saam] You wanna go
grab drinks every night.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.170
- I don't drink every night.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.413
I wanna have fun.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:50.580
Take me out then.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.020
- No.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.853
- [Woman] Fine, I'll go with my friends.

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:07.770
- Fuck your friends.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.800
- Go fuck yourself.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.840
- Listen, I don't want you going out

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.400
with all your drugged out bitches, okay.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.005
Or all your fucking
fag-hags from around town.

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:15.623
- [Woman] Oh, are you jealous?

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:18.243
- Yeah.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.963
Yeah.

01:05:19.963 --> 01:05:22.570
I'm really jealous of your main gay, Neil.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.053
Fucking twinkle toes Neil.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.693
- Oh.

01:05:30.115 --> 01:05:30.948
I get it.

01:05:32.575 --> 01:05:35.840
You think that he wants to fuck me.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.890
- No, I think he already did fuck you.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.543
- Oh yeah.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.813
So good.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.413
He was

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.443
so big.

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.303
And so long.

01:05:51.634 --> 01:05:54.400
- Why you being so fucking
ridiculous right now?

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.310
- I'm not being ridiculous.

01:05:58.763 --> 01:06:00.730
- All right, at least
somebody's getting fucked.

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.314
Go do whatever the fuck you want.

01:06:02.314 --> 01:06:03.647
Get out of here.

01:06:05.129 --> 01:06:05.962
- I will.

01:07:29.274 --> 01:07:31.857
(wind howling)

01:08:11.456 --> 01:08:12.789
- What the fuck!

01:08:20.026 --> 01:08:21.026
Who's there?

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:31.856
- Hey man.

01:08:35.127 --> 01:08:38.053
Hey man, why that dumb look on your face?

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.013
You never seen a Bojangle before?

01:08:43.126 --> 01:08:43.959
Me either, man.

01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:45.462
I just made that shit up.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:47.910
What's that smell, man?

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:50.089
You smoking some skunk or what?

01:08:50.089 --> 01:08:51.649
What you not going to offer some?

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:52.483
Come on.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.689
Pass me the fucking weed, man, come on.

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:56.523
Hurry up.

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:09.340
(coughing)

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.840
All right, shit, now
we're getting somewhere.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.350
Right, homeboy?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.997
Listen man, I know what
you planning on doing

01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:16.240
and you know what?

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.100
Whatever floats your boat,

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.023
but you think things get
easier on the other side?

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:24.694
I'm sure that's what you
think, but are you so sure?

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:26.340
- Are you a spirit?

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.750
A ghost?

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.040
- Boo!

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:29.872
Come on, man.

01:09:29.872 --> 01:09:31.893
Do I look like a fucking ghost to you?

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.930
All I'm saying is that if
you blow your brains out

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.359
are you 100% certain that all your worries

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.193
are going to go away?

01:09:39.193 --> 01:09:41.160
Whatever the fuck is going on with you.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:41.993
- Yes.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.233
Well, I won't exist.

01:09:46.643 --> 01:09:48.080
- But how do you know that?

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.296
No, really, how the fuck do you know that?

01:09:51.144 --> 01:09:53.273
- Well, I can't be a
hundred percent for sure.

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:56.920
Look, you know what?

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.400
You got this all wrong.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.100
I'm not trying to do what
you think I'm trying to do.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:03.793
- Shit, I've been scoping
you out and I'm no dummy.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.470
But if you want to fool
yourself, go ahead and do it.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.440
I'm just saying you don't know

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.400
that life's gonna be
easier on the other side.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.570
That's all.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:14.863
- Maybe not, but it's
probably better than this.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.630
- Maybe you're right, buddy?

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.270
Maybe you're right.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:21.674
Hey, you got any of that
whiskey left, champ?

01:10:21.674 --> 01:10:23.841
It's been a hell of a day.

01:10:27.909 --> 01:10:30.909
(suspenseful music)

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.509
- What's wrong?

01:14:15.509 --> 01:14:16.342
- Nothing.

01:14:22.163 --> 01:14:22.996
- Really?

01:14:25.319 --> 01:14:26.986
- It doesn't matter.

01:14:28.287 --> 01:14:31.280
- Yeah, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.490
- What is your problem?

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.750
Why you acting like such a bitch?

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.220
- You!

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.420
You, you fuckhead!

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.370
You fucking dick, you're smothering me!

01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:43.628
- There's the door.

01:14:43.628 --> 01:14:44.890
You wanna leave, get the fuck out.

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:46.970
I've already seen...

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.440
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.310
Hey!

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:50.143
Stop.

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:52.043
Stop.

01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:04.414
(indistinct talking on TV)

01:15:29.354 --> 01:15:32.104
(dramatic music)

01:16:27.811 --> 01:16:29.425
Hey.

01:16:29.425 --> 01:16:30.843
- [Woman] Mm-hm.

01:16:30.843 --> 01:16:32.815
- [Saam] Come here.

01:16:32.815 --> 01:16:33.930
Come here.

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:34.763
- Stop!

01:16:41.884 --> 01:16:43.156
- [Saam] Come here.

01:16:43.156 --> 01:16:44.656
- Seriously, stop.

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:05.311
- [Saam] What are you doing?

01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:06.358
- I'm not in the mood.

01:18:06.358 --> 01:18:08.908
- You're not in the
fucking mood, bullshit!

01:18:08.908 --> 01:18:10.075
What was that?

01:18:11.099 --> 01:18:12.347
You're not in the fucking mood!

01:18:12.347 --> 01:18:13.514
What the fuck!

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.393
- Do you love me?

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:08.733
- What do you mean?

01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:12.270
- Exactly what I said.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.340
- I mean, you mean metaphysically or what?

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.810
Like emotionally?

01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:21.810
- [Woman] This isn’t Buddhism, you asshole.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.653
Don't you know what love is?

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.890
- I mean the metaphysical
part is not Buddhism.

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:32.723
But,

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:35.563
I don't know.

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:40.400
- Well, I love you.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:43.803
- No, you don't.

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:51.023
- You're a big baby.

01:20:51.023 --> 01:20:51.856
A child.

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:54.163
A big, dumb child.

01:20:57.051 --> 01:20:57.884
- Okay.

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:07.217
(buzzing)

01:21:12.010 --> 01:21:14.683
- [Woman] I was getting
picked up at the airport.

01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:18.810
And I was going through
all the crowds and stuff

01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:19.970
trying to find my mom.

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:24.970
And I knocked into someone
and I looked down and I saw

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.670
like a pair of shoes and, for some reason,

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:32.660
I just like, I thought it was my dad.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:36.203
So, I like hugged this
guy without looking up.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.690
And then I got really, really afraid

01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:44.180
because it could have
been a random person.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.830
I didn't know who it was.

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:51.830
And as I like stepped
back and looked up to see

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:56.830
who it was I just hugged,
um, it was my dad.

01:21:58.028 --> 01:22:03.028
And I was relieved.

01:22:24.224 --> 01:22:26.391
(buzzing)

01:22:45.272 --> 01:22:47.770
- [Saam] When I was 14 years old,

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:49.793
I was walking with my friend Arthur.

01:22:51.353 --> 01:22:53.763
It was possibly in the fall or the winter.

01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:58.550
What I know for sure was
that it was a dry day.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:00.703
One of those Santa Ana winds days.

01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.180
It's funny what details you remember.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.630
We were hanging out at my
house playing video games

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.580
and it was a Wednesday which
was part of our routine

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.823
because we would get
out early from school.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.730
I believe we were playing
Shinobi or possibly Strider.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.500
But it was on the Sega Genesis

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.850
because I was one of the
first kids to get one.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.020
We were having a great time.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.780
So, the sun was starting to go down

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.650
and Arthur had to go home.

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:38.400
And I would walk him halfway home.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.753
As we started walking,
we stumbled upon a park.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.550
I remember he was walking
a little ahead of me

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:51.540
and I looked at him and, at that moment,

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:55.810
I had this weird, controlled
rage come over me.

01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:59.870
So, I started to push Arthur unprovoked.

01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:01.830
Arthur was confused.

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:03.480
He didn't know what was going on.

01:24:04.464 --> 01:24:07.270
So, he said, hey, what are you doing, man?

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:08.523
But I persisted.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.260
I kept provoking him until
he started to fight back.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.610
And, because he started to fight back,

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:18.680
I went into full dominance

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.790
because I knew I had speed over him.

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:23.323
Arthur was kind of a heavy set kid.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.623
So, I pinned him down.

01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:29.770
I picked him up and I slammed him.

01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.090
Arthur struggled.

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:34.010
You know, he fought
back with all his might.

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:37.253
But he was outmatched and,
after a while, he just gave up.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.920
With tears in his eyes, he
looked at me, totally confused.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.820
Arthur turned around and
started walking away.

01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:01.913
I had no idea what came over me.

01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:05.460
It came from a place of darkness,

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.323
one that I'm still not in control of.

01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:10.850
I don't think any of us are.

01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:19.330
And sometimes I think,
without those darkest nights,

01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:21.013
the light of day can't exist.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:25.183
(dramatic music)
