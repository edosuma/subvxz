00:37.245 --> 00:40.555
Porthos, come back here.

00:40.925 --> 00:44.122
Porthos! Stop. Return.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.600
Heel. That's it. Heel!

00:47.245 --> 00:48.598
Porthos.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.680
All right, but just for a moment.

01:12.165 --> 01:13.393
That's enough.

01:13.525 --> 01:15.993
You can come
and see him again tomorrow.

01:24.245 --> 01:26.554
It's been a long road

01:29.525 --> 01:31.243
Gettin' from there to here

01:31.365 --> 01:34.038
It's been a long time

01:35.005 --> 01:38.395
But my time is finally near

01:39.005 --> 01:42.395
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:43.085 --> 01:45.838
I will touch the sky

01:46.365 --> 01:49.755
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:50.005 --> 01:52.803
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:52.965 --> 01:57.163
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:57.685 --> 02:00.404
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:00.525 --> 02:04.643
I've got faith to believe

02:05.125 --> 02:07.764
I can do anything

02:07.885 --> 02:11.798
I've got strength of the soul

02:12.485 --> 02:15.158
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:15.285 --> 02:19.517
I can reach any star

02:20.845 --> 02:22.836
I've got faith

02:24.525 --> 02:27.483
I've got faith

02:28.165 --> 02:31.441
Faith of the heart

02:45.525 --> 02:48.835
It says here that canines
can be quite territorial.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.878
Is that why you keep returning
to the Captain's quarters?

02:56.925 --> 03:00.520
On Earth, a dog called Scruffers...

03:00.645 --> 03:02.158
travelled 3,000 kilometres...

03:02.285 --> 03:04.924
attempting to reunite
with its human keeper.

03:05.965 --> 03:10.083
I heard of a Pycan space moth
that drifted half a light-year...

03:10.365 --> 03:12.754
trying to return to its homeworld.

03:13.525 --> 03:15.914
But I don't believe it had a name.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.684
I could use a walk. How about you?

03:28.285 --> 03:31.004
Dear Dr. Lucas,
I apologise for the delay...

03:31.125 --> 03:32.558
in responding to your last letter.

03:32.685 --> 03:36.155
As you can imagine,
the crew and I have been quite busy.

03:36.805 --> 03:37.760
In we go.

03:41.485 --> 03:46.161
I was deeply saddened to hear about
your colleagues lost in the Xindi attack.

03:46.885 --> 03:48.841
You have my condolences.

03:49.285 --> 03:50.843
It's unfortunate you were forced...

03:50.965 --> 03:54.560
to cut your time on Denobula short,
but obviously you're needed on Earth.

03:55.085 --> 03:56.916
Perhaps when our mission
is successfully completed...

03:57.045 --> 03:59.605
I'll see you back in San Francisco.

04:01.005 --> 04:04.441
The Expanse,
an extremely curious place.

04:07.365 --> 04:11.643
For example, we've recently
encountered a phenomenon that...

04:11.765 --> 04:13.676
Do you want one of these?

04:14.365 --> 04:15.844
I doubt you'd like it.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.444
It's a leech, you know.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.999
It will clean out your intestinal tract.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.002
Don't tell the Captain.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.279
I currently find myself in...

04:28.405 --> 04:31.522
somewhat unsettling circumstances,
Dr. Lucas.

04:32.085 --> 04:34.394
Although they have allowed
me the luxury...

04:34.525 --> 04:37.085
of catching up on my correspondence.

04:41.725 --> 04:43.602
We first encountered the phenomenon...

04:43.725 --> 04:46.193
responsible for this situation
two days ago.

04:46.525 --> 04:48.834
It's directly on our route to Azati Prime.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.762
Why didn't sensors
pick it up before now?

04:50.885 --> 04:52.955
Because it wasn't there before now.

04:53.645 --> 04:55.044
It's similar to the phenomenon...

04:55.165 --> 04:57.156
we encountered several weeks ago.

04:57.685 --> 04:59.801
A trans-dimensional disturbance?

04:59.925 --> 05:02.837
This region is being
rapidly reconfigured as we speak.

05:03.365 --> 05:06.516
- How long would it take to go around it?
- Two weeks.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.158
Another detour.

05:08.285 --> 05:09.559
Perhaps not.

05:09.885 --> 05:12.353
Since this region was formed
only recently...

05:12.485 --> 05:14.715
it hasn't been completely reconfigured.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.559
We should still be able
to cross it safely.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.234
You said nothing from our universe
could survive inside these things.

05:21.365 --> 05:22.354
Doctor.

05:22.485 --> 05:25.875
That's true, unless we take
the appropriate precautions.

05:26.165 --> 05:29.043
The reconfigured space
disrupts the human neocortex.

05:29.165 --> 05:30.803
But I can counteract the effects...

05:30.925 --> 05:33.075
by dampening the crew's
neurological activity.

05:33.205 --> 05:36.038
It would be like shutting down
the main computer...

05:36.165 --> 05:38.474
to protect it from an ion storm.

05:39.045 --> 05:42.754
How do you plan
to shut down our neocortexes?

05:43.165 --> 05:45.884
Quite simply, I can place each of you
in a comatose state...

05:46.005 --> 05:48.599
until we've passed through
the affected region.

05:49.445 --> 05:51.481
How quickly can we get across it?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.403
Less than an hour at warp 4.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.959
I don't want to risk
going to warp in there.

05:56.085 --> 05:59.475
Who knows what effect this
disturbance will have on our warp field?

05:59.605 --> 06:02.039
We'll be safer sticking to impulse.

06:02.765 --> 06:04.995
You'll have to keep us in comas for...

06:06.325 --> 06:07.963
at least four days.

06:08.445 --> 06:11.437
That's still less time
than it would take to go around it.

06:11.565 --> 06:13.521
Can you keep us under that long?

06:13.805 --> 06:15.955
Shouldn't cause any problems.

06:16.845 --> 06:19.359
Commander Tucker was
not too keen on my plan.

06:19.485 --> 06:23.000
However, I was able to convince
Captain Archer.

06:25.965 --> 06:28.274
Since my Denobulan physiology
is immune...

06:28.405 --> 06:30.236
to the effects of the disturbance...

06:30.365 --> 06:33.243
I volunteered to watch over the crew.

06:34.365 --> 06:35.593
So far...

06:38.005 --> 06:40.439
they've been no trouble at all.

06:40.885 --> 06:43.718
While the computer's controlling
most of the ship's systems...

06:43.845 --> 06:46.643
I was given a quick tutorial, just in case.

06:46.765 --> 06:51.156
Despite the dire circumstances,
I must say I relished the challenge.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.804
And soon developed a newfound
respect for Ensign Mayweather.

06:59.965 --> 07:02.559
You need to check this
every two hours, minimum.

07:02.925 --> 07:05.803
- Every two hours.
- Lf the impulse manifolds get clogged...

07:05.925 --> 07:08.803
the engines will overload.
That would be very bad.

07:09.205 --> 07:10.558
I imagine it would.

07:10.685 --> 07:13.757
No offence, Doc,
but under normal circumstances...

07:13.885 --> 07:15.079
I wouldn't even let you in here...

07:15.205 --> 07:18.242
without four years of Starfleet training
under your belt.

07:18.365 --> 07:20.754
These are hardly
normal circumstances.

07:20.885 --> 07:24.400
Listen, if something happens...

07:24.525 --> 07:27.437
something you can't handle,
I want you to wake me up.

07:27.565 --> 07:28.554
I can't do that.

07:28.685 --> 07:31.483
Even a few minutes of exposure
would cause permanent damage.

07:31.605 --> 07:34.403
If it comes down
to saving me or the ship?

07:35.285 --> 07:38.914
Look. I'm making it easy for you, okay?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.676
How's the rest of the crew doing?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.319
Sleeping peacefully, except for you.

07:54.445 --> 07:56.754
- Now, lie back.
- Doctor...

07:57.245 --> 08:00.521
Please, Captain, I've told you
the procedure is completely safe.

08:00.645 --> 08:01.873
I'm sure it is, but l...

08:02.005 --> 08:04.997
Captain, I've already had this
discussion with Commander Tucker...

08:05.125 --> 08:08.117
Lieutenant Reed and virtually
every other officer on the ship.

08:08.245 --> 08:09.883
"I'm uncomfortable being incapacitated."

08:10.005 --> 08:12.644
"I really should be at my post.
I'm willing to risk staying awake."

08:12.765 --> 08:14.642
Well, you can't, nor do you need to.

08:14.765 --> 08:17.325
I assure you,
I have everything well in hand.

08:17.605 --> 08:18.754
I know, Doctor.

08:19.285 --> 08:23.358
As captain of this ship I'm the one
who's responsible for everyone aboard.

08:24.125 --> 08:28.641
There aren't many people I'd willingly
turn that responsibility over to.

08:29.565 --> 08:31.237
You're one of them.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.115
Thank you, Captain.

08:37.765 --> 08:41.474
I just wanted to say that
before you put me under.

08:58.485 --> 08:59.600
I must say, Dr. Lucas...

08:59.725 --> 09:02.478
that I appreciated
the Captain's vote of confidence.

09:02.605 --> 09:04.960
I had, in fact,
been feeling some trepidation...

09:05.085 --> 09:07.076
over the responsibility I'd been handed.

09:07.205 --> 09:11.562
But after two days at the helm,
the ship is running perfectly.

09:16.045 --> 09:17.364
Hello?

09:23.205 --> 09:24.433
Hello?

09:31.325 --> 09:34.203
Nonetheless,
I'm not ashamed to admit...

09:34.325 --> 09:37.954
I'll be relieved when
I can wake up the crew in...

09:42.685 --> 09:46.121
two days, 16 hours, and 43 minutes.

10:02.405 --> 10:04.965
I know, I'm sorry I'm late.

10:18.965 --> 10:21.559
I don't want the vessel with a pestle.
I want the chalice from the what?

10:21.685 --> 10:22.720
Chalice from the palace.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.676
It's a little crystal chalice
with a figure of a palace.

10:24.805 --> 10:26.523
Does the chalice from the palace
have the pellet with the poison?

10:26.645 --> 10:28.442
No, the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with a pestle.

10:28.565 --> 10:30.283
- The pestle with the vessel.
- The vessel with a pestle.

10:30.405 --> 10:31.884
What about the palace
from the chalice?

10:32.005 --> 10:33.484
Not the palace from the chalice,
the chalice from the palace.

10:33.605 --> 10:36.722
- Where's the pellet with the poison?
- In the vessel with a pestle.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.756
Don't you see, the pellet with
the poison's in the vessel with a pestle.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.557
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.755
- So easy. I can say it.
- Well, then, you find it.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.159
Listen carefully.

10:44.285 --> 10:46.799
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with a pestle.

10:46.925 --> 10:48.597
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.523
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with a pestle...

10:51.645 --> 10:52.964
Did you hear that?

10:53.125 --> 10:54.160
Just remember that.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.480
Sir Giacomo, into your armour.

10:56.605 --> 10:59.199
And you to your place in the pavilion.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.877
Computer, mute sound.

11:15.365 --> 11:17.799
That doesn't sound normal, does it?

11:20.085 --> 11:22.394
I suppose we should investigate.

11:31.325 --> 11:32.724
I'm not going alone.

11:33.685 --> 11:35.403
Come, Porthos. Come!

11:39.525 --> 11:42.483
I'd be better off
talking to my Pyrithian bat.

11:57.285 --> 12:00.834
Perhaps we were letting our
imaginations run away with us.

12:00.965 --> 12:03.763
I should never have let Mr. Tucker
talk me into watching...

12:03.885 --> 12:05.876
The Exorcist last week.

12:21.565 --> 12:22.680
Hello?

12:24.485 --> 12:25.838
It's Dr. Phlox.

12:29.645 --> 12:30.634
Porthos!

12:32.725 --> 12:35.285
Come back here!

12:35.685 --> 12:36.879
Porthos!

12:50.605 --> 12:52.994
Well, now don't you feel foolish?

13:01.205 --> 13:03.878
I called out. Didn't you hear me?

13:04.485 --> 13:06.521
I was running a diagnostic.

13:06.845 --> 13:09.040
Do you require my assistance?

13:11.365 --> 13:13.879
What are you doing here?
I thought it was movie night.

13:14.005 --> 13:15.643
I could hear that all the way
from the Mess Hall.

13:15.765 --> 13:18.723
I'll make a note of it
in the maintenance log.

13:19.885 --> 13:23.764
Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains.

13:26.285 --> 13:29.994
- Is this a starship or a haunted house?
- Are you all right, Doctor?

13:30.125 --> 13:31.877
You seem somewhat agitated.

13:32.005 --> 13:34.439
Considering you nearly
sent me into cardiac shock.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.760
I apologise if I startled you.

13:37.005 --> 13:38.996
You're certain that's all?

13:39.805 --> 13:43.002
I have had a slight headache
since we entered this region.

13:43.485 --> 13:45.203
Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines...

13:45.325 --> 13:47.919
are better able to adapt
to it than Denobulans.

13:48.645 --> 13:51.762
How are you?
I've barely seen you the last two days.

13:51.885 --> 13:53.921
I've had my duties to attend to.

13:54.205 --> 13:57.800
The rest of the time I've spent
in my quarters reading, meditating.

13:57.925 --> 14:01.520
Then you're due for a night out.
Why don't you join Porthos and me?

14:01.765 --> 14:04.325
I'd like to complete the diagnostic.

14:04.725 --> 14:06.363
The movie's quite amusing.

14:07.365 --> 14:08.844
No, thank you.

14:09.485 --> 14:10.713
T'Pol...

14:11.245 --> 14:12.678
I...

14:13.845 --> 14:17.554
Perhaps you'll share
a meal with me later.

14:18.405 --> 14:19.758
If you like.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.120
Hello?

14:52.005 --> 14:53.120
T'Pol?

14:54.645 --> 14:55.998
Is that you?

15:10.285 --> 15:11.400
Stop!

15:14.565 --> 15:16.681
- Phlox to T'Pol.
- Go ahead.

15:16.805 --> 15:20.639
Would you mind not creeping around
the ship like a Draxxan cloud viper?

15:21.005 --> 15:22.916
- Doctor?
- Please.

15:23.125 --> 15:26.037
I wouldn't have imagined that
Vulcans engaged in childish games.

15:26.165 --> 15:27.837
I don't understand.

15:28.005 --> 15:30.803
What were you doing
in Engineering just now?

15:31.125 --> 15:33.116
Doctor, I'm on the Bridge.

15:47.325 --> 15:48.883
I hope you don't mind...

15:49.005 --> 15:51.200
eating here in the Galley.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.795
The Mess Hall seems a bit melancholy.

15:55.405 --> 15:57.123
All the empty chairs.

15:57.485 --> 15:59.077
This is fine.

16:00.365 --> 16:03.880
My fifth grandmother made this
for each of my weddings.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.203
Chef's tried to prepare it...

16:06.325 --> 16:08.361
but he never gets it quite right.

16:13.485 --> 16:16.875
Yes, his plomeek broth leaves
something to be desired as well.

16:17.005 --> 16:20.520
I always thought so,
but I was afraid to mention it.

16:25.885 --> 16:29.798
T'Pol, you're sure
you weren't in Engineering today?

16:30.245 --> 16:31.564
Quite sure.

16:32.685 --> 16:34.118
What were you doing there?

16:34.245 --> 16:37.043
I'm responsible for
monitoring the engines.

16:37.325 --> 16:39.634
We're supposed to be
assisting each other.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.802
It's a large ship
for two people to maintain.

16:44.165 --> 16:46.042
Do you have anything to report?

16:48.765 --> 16:50.039
Doctor?

16:50.405 --> 16:53.044
I could have sworn there was
someone in that room with me.

16:53.165 --> 16:55.076
- A member of the crew?
- No.

16:55.205 --> 16:58.117
Everyone except us
is in deep neuro-sedation.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.480
Then obviously you were mistaken.

17:02.885 --> 17:04.159
Obviously.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.794
You've never been to Denobula,
have you?

17:07.925 --> 17:08.914
No.

17:10.125 --> 17:14.003
The cities are quite crowded,
by choice not by necessity.

17:14.244 --> 17:16.679
The atmosphere is vibrant, communal.

17:16.805 --> 17:17.954
It sounds fascinating.

17:18.085 --> 17:21.156
What I'm saying is that
we're a sociable people.

17:21.724 --> 17:25.080
Being alone on Enterprise,
just the two of us...

17:26.204 --> 17:28.844
has proven more stressful
than I imagined.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.638
Two people aren't even enough
for a Denobulan marriage...

17:31.765 --> 17:33.517
a proper one anyway.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.958
I'm sorry I haven't been better company.

17:37.085 --> 17:38.643
That isn't what I meant.

17:38.765 --> 17:39.914
I know.

17:41.445 --> 17:45.154
It is ironic however,
that I should be your sole companion.

17:46.045 --> 17:50.561
Unlike your people, most Vulcans
will go to great lengths to find solitude.

17:51.085 --> 17:55.601
At times, it has been trying for me
to coexist with 80 humans...

17:57.285 --> 17:59.753
especially the more irrational ones.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.281
Such as Commander Tucker.

18:03.605 --> 18:06.915
I've found the last two days
to be a welcome respite.

18:07.605 --> 18:09.482
I understand, but I for one will never...

18:09.605 --> 18:12.802
complain again when I can't
get a good seat on movie night.

18:17.645 --> 18:18.839
Despite the tragic circumstances...

18:18.965 --> 18:20.796
surrounding your homecoming,
Dr. Lucas...

18:20.925 --> 18:23.439
you must be happy to return to Earth.

18:25.925 --> 18:27.836
As I've mentioned before
I have no regrets...

18:27.965 --> 18:30.763
about accepting
my position on Enterprise.

18:31.005 --> 18:33.644
However, it has struck me recently
how much I miss...

18:33.765 --> 18:36.040
the familiar pleasures of my home.

18:40.845 --> 18:43.837
You've experienced the
nightclubs in our Kaybin district...

18:43.965 --> 18:48.197
so you know the excitement of meeting
a new companion or two.

18:48.325 --> 18:52.398
The intimacy that can develop so
quickly when all parties are receptive.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.284
You humans are a truly remarkable
species Dr. Lucas...

18:55.405 --> 18:57.794
but when Enterprise
has accomplished its mission...

18:57.925 --> 19:02.237
I look forward to being
among Denobulans again.

19:04.045 --> 19:05.922
The more of them the better.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.796
Good afternoon, Captain.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.520
How are we feeling today?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.520
Neurochemistry looks excellent.

19:22.005 --> 19:23.677
Theta waves are good.

19:23.805 --> 19:26.763
You should wake up
extremely well rested.

19:52.405 --> 19:53.963
Phlox to T'Pol!

19:56.045 --> 19:58.957
Internal sensors don't show
any additional bio-signs.

19:59.085 --> 20:01.724
I told you it was outside the ship,
on the hull.

20:01.845 --> 20:04.200
There are no life-forms
anywhere in this vicinity.

20:04.325 --> 20:05.644
What about alien vessels?

20:05.765 --> 20:08.757
You can see for yourself
there's nothing there.

20:09.725 --> 20:12.683
You said this reconfigured space
could be affecting our systems.

20:12.805 --> 20:14.318
What if it's interfering with our sensors?

20:14.445 --> 20:15.594
That's possible...

20:15.725 --> 20:18.717
but we should consider
another explanation.

20:18.845 --> 20:20.517
You mentioned
you were having difficulty...

20:20.645 --> 20:22.715
adjusting to the solitude
of the past few days.

20:22.845 --> 20:25.439
I didn't imagine it. I saw something.

20:25.805 --> 20:28.399
Outside the ship, crawling on the hull.

20:30.285 --> 20:33.880
- What about what I saw in Engineering?
- You ran the scans yourself.

20:34.085 --> 20:36.474
There is nothing unusual on board.

20:41.685 --> 20:45.280
You said you haven't slept much
since we entered this disturbance.

20:45.405 --> 20:48.875
Perhaps you should return
to your quarters, try to rest.

20:52.445 --> 20:54.481
I need to finish my rounds.

21:12.925 --> 21:14.836
Get away from her!

22:06.485 --> 22:08.760
- Phlox to T'Pol.
- Go ahead, Doctor.

22:09.165 --> 22:11.440
It's the Xindi. They're on board.

22:13.965 --> 22:17.275
We'll need to arm ourselves. I saw two.
There could be more of them.

22:17.405 --> 22:21.000
- There's nothing on the sensors.
- Then the sensors must be wrong!

22:21.285 --> 22:22.434
Doctor.

22:23.285 --> 22:24.400
Phlox!

22:25.005 --> 22:27.075
I thought you were going
to get some rest.

22:27.205 --> 22:29.196
They were real! I saw them.

22:29.325 --> 22:32.601
If that's true, then how did they get
on the ship?

22:33.365 --> 22:35.799
All external hatches
and docking ports are sealed.

22:35.925 --> 22:37.517
They could have transporter technology.

22:37.645 --> 22:39.363
There were no transporter signatures.

22:39.485 --> 22:42.761
What difference does it make
how they got on board?

22:43.325 --> 22:45.202
If we wake up Lieutenant Reed
or the MACOs...

22:45.325 --> 22:48.078
they will be incapacitated
within minutes, dead within hours.

22:48.205 --> 22:51.038
It is up to us to deal with this situation.

22:53.725 --> 22:55.875
I plan to start on G-Deck
and work my way up.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.394
I'm going to stop them
whether you help me or not.

24:06.685 --> 24:09.995
- We have searched four decks.
- That leaves three to go.

24:10.405 --> 24:14.034
If there are Xindi aboard,
why are they concealing themselves?

24:14.165 --> 24:16.281
They could be trying
to destroy Enterprise.

24:16.405 --> 24:19.841
What better time than while
the crew is incapacitated?

24:20.405 --> 24:21.599
A bio-sign.

24:21.725 --> 24:25.320
There are over 80 bio-signs aboard,
not counting your pets in Sickbay.

24:25.445 --> 24:28.164
- This isn't human.
- Neither are your pets.

24:29.365 --> 24:32.084
- I can't lock onto it.
- There must be some interference...

24:32.205 --> 24:34.116
possibly from the reconfigured space.

24:34.245 --> 24:36.156
You said it wasn't affecting our sensors.

24:36.285 --> 24:38.003
I said it wasn't affecting main sensors.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.878
That hand-scanner
is far less powerful, you know that.

24:41.005 --> 24:42.279
I have it!

24:54.645 --> 24:56.078
It's just ahead.

25:09.805 --> 25:10.874
Doctor!

25:17.245 --> 25:18.564
It's all right.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.316
Fortunately, I'm not very proficient
with hand weapons.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.277
How did he get out?

25:24.405 --> 25:26.441
I believe I...

25:27.205 --> 25:28.797
We went for a walk earlier...

25:28.925 --> 25:31.644
I might have neglected
to put him back in my quarters.

25:31.765 --> 25:33.437
And you simply forgot?

25:33.645 --> 25:36.113
I've been distracted!
I would have thought this could...

25:36.245 --> 25:38.759
tell the difference between
a giant insect and a beagle.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.557
It can, if you use it properly.

25:40.685 --> 25:41.674
You're the Science Officer...

25:41.805 --> 25:43.955
you might have offered some assistance
in that area.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.803
You feel I haven't been helpful?

25:45.925 --> 25:48.280
How would you characterise
the two hours I wasted...

25:48.405 --> 25:50.475
searching for a figment
of your imagination?

25:50.605 --> 25:52.800
- I'm not delusional!
- Are you certain?

25:52.925 --> 25:54.995
As I recall, you once told Ensign Sato...

25:55.125 --> 25:58.481
that it's considered healthy
for Denobulans to hallucinate.

25:58.605 --> 26:00.118
It's how you release stress.

26:00.245 --> 26:03.601
You've been under a lot of stress lately,
haven't you, Doctor?

26:03.925 --> 26:05.483
It's not unheard of, but...

26:05.605 --> 26:08.085
You said you've been
having headaches.

26:08.365 --> 26:10.401
Is there anything else you care
to tell me?

26:10.525 --> 26:13.085
- I'm fine.
- You nearly shot the Captain's dog.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.083
I'm going to recalibrate this
to exclude canine bio-signs...

26:16.205 --> 26:18.719
and then I'm going
to finish searching this ship.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.962
I am not seeing things,
and I intend to prove it!

26:29.645 --> 26:31.681
Ensign Sato to the Doctor!

26:35.445 --> 26:36.560
Hoshi?

26:47.885 --> 26:48.840
Ensign?

26:58.325 --> 26:59.280
Hoshi?

27:01.765 --> 27:03.323
What are you doing?

27:03.445 --> 27:05.720
I have to put you back
under sedation immediately.

27:05.845 --> 27:07.722
You'll suffer permanent damage.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.160
Hoshi.

27:11.885 --> 27:14.319
- You did this.
- What?

27:15.325 --> 27:16.917
You said we'd be safe.

27:18.085 --> 27:20.883
- Let me get you to Sickbay.
- You promised us!

27:51.125 --> 27:52.080
T'Pol...

27:53.965 --> 27:56.559
please meet me in Sickbay immediately.

28:09.405 --> 28:11.999
Where have you been?
I was calling you.

28:12.325 --> 28:15.362
Captain. What are you doing up?

28:15.885 --> 28:18.524
T'Pol woke me.
She said something was wrong.

28:19.205 --> 28:20.797
I don't know what's happening.

28:20.925 --> 28:22.756
She said you've been seeing things.

28:22.885 --> 28:25.524
Something about Xindi
on board the ship.

28:27.445 --> 28:29.720
You're not concerned about that?

28:30.005 --> 28:33.759
I'm more concerned about you.
I obviously expected too much from you.

28:33.885 --> 28:34.840
You're not real.

28:34.965 --> 28:38.435
Why don't you go to your quarters?
Lie down. I'll take over.

28:38.765 --> 28:40.244
You did the best you could.

28:40.365 --> 28:41.354
You are not real!

28:41.485 --> 28:42.634
Doctor?

28:55.725 --> 28:57.397
I was so busy monitoring the crew.

28:57.525 --> 29:00.597
I never thought to run
another neural scan on myself.

29:03.245 --> 29:05.839
The effects are subtle
and difficult to detect...

29:05.965 --> 29:07.717
but there are disruptions...

29:08.125 --> 29:09.763
deep within my neocortex.

29:12.325 --> 29:13.963
You were right.

29:14.485 --> 29:16.874
I was hallucinating.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.363
Are you in danger?

29:22.085 --> 29:25.282
I don't believe there'll be
any permanent damage.

29:25.685 --> 29:28.074
However, it's obviously
affecting my judgement.

29:28.205 --> 29:32.164
I have no choice but to put myself
under neuro-sedation...

29:32.405 --> 29:35.044
and ask you to look after the crew.

29:36.685 --> 29:38.403
I don't have the medical expertise.

29:38.525 --> 29:40.959
With your scientific background,
you should have no problems.

29:41.085 --> 29:44.680
I have my own duties.
I can't possibly monitor the entire crew.

29:44.805 --> 29:46.079
It won't be for long.

29:46.205 --> 29:49.242
We'll be coming out of the disturbance
in less than six hours.

29:49.365 --> 29:51.037
T'Pol, I'm asking for your help.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.235
- I can't.
- Why not?

29:55.765 --> 29:59.599
When we were searching the ship,
I became irritated with you.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.037
- Apparently, I deserved it.
- You don't understand.

30:04.485 --> 30:07.397
I was on the verge of losing control
of my emotions.

30:09.765 --> 30:12.404
This reconfigured space
is affecting me as well.

30:13.325 --> 30:15.202
Why didn't you tell me?

30:15.325 --> 30:17.156
I'd hoped to control it...

30:17.285 --> 30:19.799
but it's proven more difficult
than I thought.

30:19.925 --> 30:22.485
The crew is better off in your hands.

30:23.965 --> 30:27.480
I doubt that.
I nearly killed Porthos, remember?

30:27.605 --> 30:29.561
What if one of these delusions
causes me...

30:29.685 --> 30:31.641
to open an air lock
or shut down life support?

30:31.765 --> 30:33.881
- You won't do that.
- How do you know?

30:34.685 --> 30:38.678
Because your duty is to look out for
the welfare of this crew.

30:38.965 --> 30:41.718
Why do you think the Captain allowed
you to sedate him...

30:41.845 --> 30:43.915
over Commander Tucker's objections?

30:44.605 --> 30:47.881
Because he trusts you, as do I.

30:50.045 --> 30:54.163
- I'm not sure I trust myself.
- Just a few more hours, Doctor.

30:58.445 --> 31:01.676
So, Dr. Lucas, while the past few
days have proven challenging...

31:01.805 --> 31:06.003
both T'Pol and I are relieved
that our adventure is nearly over.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.279
Once we've confirmed
we're out of the disturbance...

31:09.405 --> 31:13.239
I can begin waking the senior officers.
My medical staff should be next.

31:14.485 --> 31:17.204
They can assist me
with the rest of the...

31:18.285 --> 31:21.561
We should have been
out of the disturbance half an hour ago.

31:22.725 --> 31:25.842
There could have been some slight
navigational discrepancies.

31:25.965 --> 31:28.479
I thought space travel was supposed
to be precise.

31:28.605 --> 31:32.234
- Not always. Check long-range sensors.
- What do you think I'm doing?

31:34.405 --> 31:36.282
There's more than a slight discrepancy.

31:36.405 --> 31:38.236
This can't be correct.

31:38.365 --> 31:41.084
We're nearly a quarter of a light-year
from the far edge.

31:41.205 --> 31:45.835
At our current rate of speed, we won't
be out of this for another 10 weeks.

31:54.725 --> 31:56.238
Auto-navigation is still engaged...

31:56.365 --> 31:58.196
engines are online
why aren't we through?

31:58.325 --> 32:01.078
- The reconfigured space has expanded.
- But we knew it would.

32:01.205 --> 32:04.003
Travis said our course
and speed would compensate.

32:05.085 --> 32:06.120
T'Pol?

32:06.645 --> 32:09.113
Obviously the rate of expansion
has accelerated.

32:09.245 --> 32:12.555
- We need to increase speed.
- We're already at full impulse.

32:12.685 --> 32:15.245
As you can see, that's insufficient.
We need to go to warp.

32:15.365 --> 32:17.117
Commander Tucker said it
would be too dangerous.

32:17.245 --> 32:19.759
- We don't know what might happen.
- What do you propose?

32:19.885 --> 32:23.002
Keeping the crew comatose
for the next 10 weeks?

32:25.085 --> 32:27.360
All right. What do we do first?

32:27.845 --> 32:30.200
I'm afraid I may not be
of much assistance.

32:30.325 --> 32:32.634
Do I need to keep reminding you,
you are the Science Officer?

32:32.765 --> 32:35.325
I already told you,
I'm finding it difficult to focus.

32:35.445 --> 32:38.517
On your worst day you're more qualified
to operate the warp engines than I am.

32:38.645 --> 32:41.523
Unfortunately, this is by far
one of my worst days.

32:41.645 --> 32:43.795
I'm a physician, not an engineer.

32:43.925 --> 32:48.157
- You hold a dozen scientific degrees.
- None of them are in warp theory.

32:49.805 --> 32:53.593
The procedures for restarting
the reactor are in the database.

32:54.485 --> 32:57.045
Are you suggesting I read the manual?

33:01.405 --> 33:04.920
"Output must be confined
to within 300 and 312...

33:05.045 --> 33:09.038
"millicochranes to prevent
fusion of the dilithium matrix."

33:09.165 --> 33:11.121
That seems simple enough.

33:12.965 --> 33:17.163
"Unless the spatial-compression index
is greater than 5.62%...

33:17.285 --> 33:19.674
"or the ship is within two parsecs...

33:19.805 --> 33:22.524
"of a Class-C
gravimetric field distortion."

33:23.565 --> 33:25.760
I realise this is a complex procedure.

33:25.885 --> 33:29.355
Complex? This is utterly baffling.
Might as well be in ancient Klingon...

33:29.485 --> 33:31.919
for all the sense I can make of it.

33:34.765 --> 33:35.834
I'm sorry.

33:36.285 --> 33:39.436
I understand.
I just wish I could be more helpful.

33:40.245 --> 33:43.715
You're doing fine.
We have to close the plasma relays...

33:43.845 --> 33:47.520
before we can begin the start-up
sequence. Would you mind?

33:49.445 --> 33:51.083
What the hell are you doing?

33:51.205 --> 33:53.514
I told you not to mess
with the warp engines.

33:53.645 --> 33:57.035
- I don't have time for this.
- You better make time, Doc.

33:57.165 --> 34:00.714
I told you, you can't start the warp
reactor inside this disturbance.

34:00.845 --> 34:03.234
Actually, you told me
it would be difficult, not impossible.

34:03.365 --> 34:05.435
That machine was designed
to manipulate space...

34:05.565 --> 34:07.442
to violate the laws of motion.

34:07.565 --> 34:10.476
You make the tiniest mistake,
you'll collapse the warp field...

34:10.605 --> 34:12.083
you'll crush this ship.

34:12.205 --> 34:13.194
Thank you for the warning.

34:13.324 --> 34:14.838
- You're gonna screw this up.
- Go away!

34:14.965 --> 34:16.284
You're gonna kill everybody!

34:16.405 --> 34:19.761
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doctor. Are you all right?

34:22.565 --> 34:23.634
Fine.

34:24.005 --> 34:25.040
Doctor?

34:25.804 --> 34:29.161
I can't find the plasma relays.

34:29.804 --> 34:31.445
I'll do it myself.

34:34.485 --> 34:36.601
Deuterium pressure is nominal.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.920
Antimatter constrictor coils are online.
Warp 2?

34:41.045 --> 34:43.513
- Should be sufficient?
- Shall we try?

34:49.525 --> 34:51.402
The intermix is stable.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.717
A warp field is forming.

34:56.364 --> 34:59.038
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

35:09.285 --> 35:11.594
I followed the procedures exactly.

35:11.725 --> 35:13.716
- What did I do wrong?
- You need to...

35:13.845 --> 35:16.120
What, T'Pol? Help me!

35:17.045 --> 35:20.162
Is it the particle confinement?

35:20.285 --> 35:23.322
- Perhaps you should increase it.
- How do I do that?

35:28.085 --> 35:30.076
Particle confinement.

35:34.245 --> 35:37.396
Doctor. Perhaps we should wake
Commander Tucker.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.797
- He'll die.
- Lf we destroy the ship, we'll all die.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.154
I know.

35:44.405 --> 35:48.478
If we can't accomplish our mission,
billions of people on Earth could die.

35:48.605 --> 35:52.041
Isn't it logical to sacrifice one life
to save so many?

35:52.725 --> 35:55.478
I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yet!

35:57.205 --> 35:59.161
Particle confinement!

36:00.645 --> 36:03.762
Increase power
to the magnetic constriction coils.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.876
T'Pol! Here!

36:21.005 --> 36:22.961
The field is stabilising.

36:24.565 --> 36:25.964
It's holding.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.275
Then I suggest we go to warp.

36:28.605 --> 36:30.516
Engaging warp engines.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.443
Warp 1.1...

36:44.085 --> 36:45.484
1.2.

36:48.205 --> 36:50.355
Pressure on the hull's increasing.

36:51.525 --> 36:52.514
What are you doing?

36:52.645 --> 36:55.557
Lieutenant Reed insisted on showing
me how to transfer power...

36:55.685 --> 36:57.880
to the hull plating. Just in case.

37:02.925 --> 37:04.802
It seems to be working.

37:05.365 --> 37:08.675
Warp 1.8, 1.9.

37:09.805 --> 37:10.999
Warp 2!

37:34.205 --> 37:35.479
Doctor...

37:36.445 --> 37:37.958
Lie still.

37:38.765 --> 37:41.882
Your neocortex may need
a few moments to warm up.

37:44.565 --> 37:46.556
Are we through the disturbance?

37:46.685 --> 37:49.677
Yes. I'll begin waking
the rest of the crew shortly.

37:50.885 --> 37:52.398
Any problems?

37:54.165 --> 37:57.601
A few minor glitches.
It will all be in my log.

37:59.565 --> 38:02.557
If you're feeling up to it,
you have a visitor.

38:04.485 --> 38:05.440
Hey.

38:09.125 --> 38:10.638
Thanks, Doctor.

38:12.725 --> 38:15.285
- How are you feeling?
- A little woozy.

38:15.685 --> 38:18.563
I'm not surprised.
You haven't eaten anything in four days.

38:18.685 --> 38:20.038
Get to the Mess Hall.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.598
Aye, aye, Doc.

38:26.525 --> 38:28.117
I'll assist you in waking the others.

38:28.245 --> 38:31.157
That won't be necessary.
I appreciate the offer...

38:31.285 --> 38:34.482
but you need some rest.
Let me walk you to your quarters.

38:34.605 --> 38:35.924
Doctor's orders?

38:44.085 --> 38:45.359
Thank you.

38:46.805 --> 38:50.275
I'll stop by and check on you
in a few hours.

39:11.005 --> 39:13.917
As you might guess,
Dr. Lucas, I had considered...

39:14.045 --> 39:16.081
deleting this letter and starting over...

39:16.205 --> 39:18.924
since large sections of it
are now obviously fictitious.

39:19.045 --> 39:21.479
However, I decided
that my delusional account...

39:21.605 --> 39:23.277
would probably prove entertaining.

39:23.405 --> 39:27.921
As always, you have my best wishes.
Your friend and colleague, Phlox.

39:29.405 --> 39:31.635
- May I join you?
- Of course.

39:35.565 --> 39:39.001
Commander Tucker was complaining
that it will take him days to realign...

39:39.125 --> 39:40.763
the warp coils.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.394
Yes, he gave me quite a talking to.

39:44.525 --> 39:46.481
He also said, and I quote:

39:46.845 --> 39:48.756
"Phlox did one hell of a job."

39:50.725 --> 39:52.363
Excuse me, Doctor.

39:54.605 --> 39:57.756
You must have enjoyed
having the ship to yourself.

39:58.525 --> 40:01.323
It wasn't nearly as empty
as I anticipated.
