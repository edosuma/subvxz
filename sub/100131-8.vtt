WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:06.882
You wish to return me to Kanzua?
There is no Kanzua.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.384
You think I'm going to tell my men

00:09.468 --> 00:12.971
all their families were killed
to save your dynasty?

00:13.055 --> 00:14.556
I am their queen.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.601
I think that's something
we should reconsider.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.229
<i>I want both of you to know
what we set out to know.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.606
<i>I want to know
what we all sacrificed so much for.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.650
<i>I want to know
what I sacrificed my wife for.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:25.776
Something doesn't feel right.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.739
-Haniwa, no!
-Cease fire!

00:30.822 --> 00:32.616
-You are Haniwa?
-Yes.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.077
-And you who shouted, what's your name?
-Kofun.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.496
<i>Just beyond these trees there is a bridge.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:40.707
<i>You may pass over that bridge
into the House of Enlightenment.</i>

00:40.791 --> 00:43.502
<i>Only the children of Jerlamarel may cross.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.212
You and me together, little brother.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.216
<i>The day has come,
and you must meet your father.</i>

01:49.901 --> 01:50.902
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

01:57.993 --> 01:58.994
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

02:46.583 --> 02:51.880
Haniwa, Kofun, I'm very happy to see you.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.340
Are you...

02:53.423 --> 02:56.385
I'm Jerlamarel. Your father.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.992
When I heard the queen and her
Witchfinders found the Alkenny,

03:20.075 --> 03:21.368
I feared the worst.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.706
Let me look at you.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.836
Well, you must be exhausted
from your journey.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.630
Come. I'll get you settled.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.176
The House of Enlightenment.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.263
I've never seen anything like it.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.016
I found the building mostly intact.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.978
It was once a prison,
so it was built to last.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.648
Took me years of scavenging for parts
to build a generator,

03:51.732 --> 03:56.820
but because of that we have electricity
for light, hot water, heat.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.823
Everyone's so excited to meet you.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.701
Everyone?

04:07.706 --> 04:08.707
It's me.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.217
Meet your brothers and sisters.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.637
Haniwa, Kofun, you made it.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.101
I am Oloman, your brother.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.103
This is Sheva.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.483
-That's Nonni, Sammy.
-Welcome.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.109
This is Sheena.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.820
Welcome.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.490
Nice to meet you.

04:41.573 --> 04:46.119
And these two little monsters over here
are Hayah and Hoveh.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.458
You must be hungry.
Let's get some food.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.511
For the food we eat
and the family we eat it with,

05:02.594 --> 05:06.098
including our newest brother and sister,

05:06.765 --> 05:08.433
we give thanks.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.477
You may begin.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.582
<i>Now you need to get some rest.</i>

05:34.126 --> 05:38.296
Haniwa, this is your room.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.425
Kofun's will be right next door.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.345
Here are your things.
This is your bed.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.396
This is a painting by Claude Monet.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.818
Well, it's not an actual painting.
It's a reproduction.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.322
It's beautiful, isn't it?

06:08.243 --> 06:09.453
Yes, it is.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.708
And I've saved the best for last.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.088
These are your showers.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.100
And this bottle here, your soap.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.771
The water even gets heated.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.524
Yes. We read about it in the books.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.527
I think you'll find this a bit more
satisfying than reading about it.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.823
Come, Kofun. I'll show you your room.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.500
They expect us to sleep in these things?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.588
I guess so.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.050
If we're all one big family,
why don't we sleep together?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
I was thinking the same thing.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.060
Here. Get in.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.410
So warm, without any fire.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.337
I miss Dad.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.427
I miss him too.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.184
Do you think
we're ever gonna be with him again?

09:24.523 --> 09:25.607
I don't know.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.657
We just left him on his own...

09:35.117 --> 09:37.619
after everything that happened with Mom.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.417
I don't know why we came here.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.648
No one talks to her.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.902
No one comes near her.
Watch her like your life depends on it.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.028
Does it?

10:53.695 --> 10:54.738
Yes.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.644
You were right.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.398
You warned me that sooner or later

11:30.232 --> 11:35.445
I would regret supporting
your sister's continued reign.

11:41.618 --> 11:47.040
But I doubt even you could have predicted
just how right you'd be.

11:55.257 --> 12:00.429
Each one of these soldiers
lost a parent, child, a sibling, a spouse.

12:03.932 --> 12:09.479
Every one of them could become the leader
of the mutiny against her... or us.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.568
If they find out about what she's done,

12:15.944 --> 12:17.571
I fear there'll be no stopping it.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.697
If?

12:20.198 --> 12:21.908
How can it be prevented?

12:24.077 --> 12:29.291
The only people here who know the story
are you, me, your witch

12:29.374 --> 12:32.002
and the queen's accomplice,
who is currently under guard.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.962
And the queen herself.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.508
Sooner or later, your men
are gonna want to hear from their queen.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.304
And how do we prevent the story
from coming out then?

12:43.305 --> 12:46.808
She cannot be allowed to emerge
from that building as queen again.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.894
What exactly does that mean?

12:49.478 --> 12:53.065
It means there are two outcomes
available to us.

12:53.148 --> 12:57.027
Either she emerges having abdicated
the throne willingly,

12:57.444 --> 13:01.907
blessed her sister as her successor
and agreed to be ruled by her...

13:02.366 --> 13:06.662
or she does not emerge at all.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.707
She will never give up the throne
no matter what you say to her.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.878
Nothing I can say
would persuade her to do it.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.590
So you will have to try.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.430
You're with Princess Maghra, yes?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.353
The Witchfinder trusts you to guard me.

13:31.436 --> 13:35.816
I presume that means you're sworn
either to him or to her.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.943
And I have to assume it's to her,

13:38.026 --> 13:41.655
given the contempt
that he clearly holds for you.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.407
You should be quiet now.

13:43.490 --> 13:50.205
Just yesterday I was property
to the most brutal of men.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.876
I acquiesced because it was better
than the alternative...

13:56.586 --> 13:59.673
right up to the moment when it wasn't.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.636
What is it exactly that you owe her?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.681
Your loyalty perhaps.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.599
But your obedience,

14:10.392 --> 14:13.103
your future, your life?

14:14.396 --> 14:16.023
How can that be?

14:19.151 --> 14:23.822
The queen has made it clear what
I stand to gain if I solve this problem.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.991
Let me make it clear to you

14:26.074 --> 14:30.370
what you stand to gain
if you help me solve it.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.917
It's good to be lieutenant to a princess,

14:36.835 --> 14:42.257
but it's so much better
to be lieutenant to a queen.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.594
What's this?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.305
Read it.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.734
There was a time, before all this,

15:43.402 --> 15:46.488
where you could still be counted on
to see reason.

15:48.699 --> 15:51.743
I remember that version of my sister.

15:52.911 --> 15:57.374
And I'm here in the hopes
that she still exists within you.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.713
And that she'll accept
the reality of her situation

16:03.213 --> 16:05.924
and do the sensible thing.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.098
"Abdicate the throne."

16:14.933 --> 16:19.021
Affix your seal. Endorse it.

16:20.731 --> 16:24.609
Read it to the men, today, right now.

16:25.944 --> 16:32.868
And accept its result that you will live
under my rule as queen.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.414
What a fantasy this must have been.

16:37.497 --> 16:42.878
Walking in here, thinking I might
actually do this for you.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.256
For me?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.263
Do it. Don't do it.

16:53.847 --> 16:58.101
I offer this to you out of mercy
and for the sake of our father's memory.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.313
Whether you choose
to accept it or not is your choice.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.989
But it isn't my choice, Maghra.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.284
You know that.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.416
It's just not something
that can be bargained away.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.505
Negotiated under duress to save my life

17:26.963 --> 17:29.508
or to impart
some longed-for meaning to yours.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.221
Only the gods decide who's king or queen.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.140
And when they do, Death must be a witness,

17:37.974 --> 17:42.437
or there is no succession,
no majesty, no legitimacy.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.732
Just a petty lie agreed upon
by petty people.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.153
If you want my divinity,

17:51.405 --> 17:54.408
one of you must have the courage
to pick up a knife and come take it.

17:54.491 --> 17:58.704
God's law, God's voice, God's words.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.999
It's amazing how they all just align

18:02.082 --> 18:05.711
with whatever it is
that you want at any given moment.

18:07.129 --> 18:11.425
It is fitting then that you'll meet
your end in a place like this,

18:11.507 --> 18:13.885
declaring God's will to be on your side

18:13.968 --> 18:17.179
as misfortune strips you
of everything and anything

18:17.264 --> 18:20.391
that you once laid claim to bit by bit.

18:21.977 --> 18:24.353
The offer to abdicate stands.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.483
Do it, don't do it.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.069
It's entirely up to you.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.480
Get any sleep?

19:07.522 --> 19:08.649
Not really.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.400
I can imagine.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.611
You've left behind everything
you've ever known.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.989
It's natural to feel a bit lost.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.576
But I promise you, the opposite is true.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.121
You're with your family now.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.125
Come on. I'll show you around.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.795
This is where we study every day.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.046
A pencil?

19:31.588 --> 19:33.256
We all have so much to learn.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.383
Right?

19:35.967 --> 19:39.096
And here we are, the librarium.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.017
Took me almost ten years
to get all these books in here.

19:44.685 --> 19:48.438
Science, mathematics, medicine,

19:49.189 --> 19:54.611
history, geography, engineering,
literature.

19:55.946 --> 19:59.408
Our ancestors were very meticulous
when it came to documenting

19:59.491 --> 20:02.077
their knowledge and accomplishments
for posterity.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.539
It's almost as if they knew
we would one day need them.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.545
There is so much I'd like to share
with you, this blessing that we have.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.719
This blessing can often feel
like a curse, can't it?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.723
Because every day,
we see all the wasted potential

20:22.806 --> 20:25.350
in this world and in ourselves.

20:25.809 --> 20:26.852
And you feel alone.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.146
Really?

20:30.272 --> 20:31.982
Kofun, you know what I mean.

20:33.817 --> 20:39.323
We've had to hide all of these things
that we can do from everyone.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.199
Exactly.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.829
I've spent most of my life traveling,
searching for others like me.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.416
And I've crossed the Trivantes
all the way to the Western Badlands.

20:49.499 --> 20:53.378
And west of the Payan
all the way to the Atlantic.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.922
I have never found a sighted person.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.466
You've seen the ocean?

20:58.300 --> 20:59.593
I've swum in it.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.179
So, why did you come back?

21:03.138 --> 21:04.389
To build this place.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.641
A citadel of knowledge

21:07.309 --> 21:11.813
and a sanctuary where we could
safely gather and learn.

21:12.606 --> 21:17.694
Educating ourselves and eventually others
of the sciences of our forefathers.

21:17.778 --> 21:20.489
But you said you never found
another person with sight.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.785
I didn't. So, I made you.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.161
Are we all your children?

21:28.038 --> 21:31.458
Yes. You, Kofun,

21:32.376 --> 21:34.419
Oloman, Sheva.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.963
Everyone except the two little ones.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.632
They are Oloman's.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.425
And their mothers?

21:41.385 --> 21:43.637
They love their mothers dearly
as you love yours.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.847
And there is always a place for her here.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.224
Our mother is dead.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.977
-What?
-She was killed by the Witchfinders.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.856
I am very sorry to hear that.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.734
I was quite fond of her.

21:57.818 --> 22:00.070
Can't have been that fond of her.
You left her alone.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.947
-Kofun.
-Pregnant with your children.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.700
You left us alone our entire lives.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.995
Did you not want to know us?

22:08.078 --> 22:10.580
Who we were, what we were like?

22:11.999 --> 22:13.667
You have every right to be upset.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.295
You know, I would be lying
if I said I didn't regret

22:17.379 --> 22:19.423
the way I handled some of these matters.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.883
I was young. Often unwise.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.678
Being chosen doesn't make me perfect.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.014
No, far from it.

22:27.973 --> 22:31.685
But I was chosen, Kofun.
You must see that.

22:32.811 --> 22:35.022
A sighted baby born to blind parents.

22:35.105 --> 22:38.567
I was born to be a bridge
between this dark world

22:38.650 --> 22:40.277
and a better one to come.

22:40.694 --> 22:44.740
We've been given a divine mission.
And we will be remembered.

22:44.823 --> 22:48.910
Our names will be spoken
for the rest of human history.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.378
Come on. I'll show you the generator.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.258
What are you doing?

23:03.967 --> 23:06.053
He doesn't even care that Mom is dead.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.971
Of course he cared.

23:08.055 --> 23:11.016
He was clearly upset about it,
but she wasn't his wife.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.018
No, she was just there
to carry his babies.

23:13.101 --> 23:16.980
To carry us, Kofun.
I don't think you're being very fair.

23:17.064 --> 23:21.526
What, so he believed that we were chosen
to bring light into the world?

23:21.610 --> 23:22.653
Chosen.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.446
Born.

23:25.113 --> 23:30.369
Call it what you like. All I know is that
we've lived our lives in fear until now.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.205
Hunted by people
who should really be afraid of us.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.708
Wait, you want to be feared?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.754
I'd rather be feared
than burned as a witch.

23:41.630 --> 23:42.798
Ready?

23:52.391 --> 23:53.809
Is that all coal?

23:54.393 --> 23:57.562
Yes, we have our own mine
just beyond the fence line.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.982
The Payan lands are rich in coal.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.275
That's how you power the lights?

24:02.359 --> 24:04.236
Yeah. I'll show you.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.238
Oloman.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.281
Morning.

24:09.408 --> 24:12.703
The burning of the coal in the boiler
creates steam under pressure.

24:12.786 --> 24:17.165
Blows into the turbines which spins
the generator to create electricity.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.085
You built this alone?

24:20.585 --> 24:23.005
Yes. I rebuilt it.

24:23.088 --> 24:26.008
But Oloman, he's the one that learned
how to really make it sing.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.803
I just added this.
Pressure release valve.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.014
See, you've got to control the pressure,

24:32.097 --> 24:34.433
or you either end up with none
or way too much.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.685
Either way, no power.

24:37.477 --> 24:41.315
Imagine what we can accomplish together
once we grow in numbers.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.859
We'll be able to light entire cities.

24:44.276 --> 24:47.029
What are cities for the blind people
gonna do with all that light?

24:47.112 --> 24:48.864
These cities will be for the sighted.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.867
There's about ten of us.
What about everyone else?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.702
Is your plan just to leave them behind?

24:53.785 --> 24:56.038
No. No, of course not, Kofun.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.541
But make no mistake,
in the natural order of things,

24:59.624 --> 25:01.877
the blind are the aberration, not us.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.421
And soon enough, they will come to us,

25:04.504 --> 25:07.007
asking us to father sighted children.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.010
Children that will need
to be educated in a place like this.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.471
And in the future, other places like this.

25:13.347 --> 25:17.059
God, nature, whatever you wish to call it,

25:17.142 --> 25:19.728
has elected to restore vision to humanity.

25:20.062 --> 25:23.106
And that responsibility
has been given to us.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.027
-Thank you, Oloman.
-Yes, sir.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.324
Kofun.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.333
I know Jerlamarel
can take some getting used to.

25:43.877 --> 25:47.047
Does he think he's some kind of god?
That we're all gods?

25:47.130 --> 25:51.927
No, not gods,
but the first of a new breed.

25:52.594 --> 25:56.056
A returning race of humans
that can help realize our true potential

25:56.139 --> 25:59.643
after living like frightened animals
in the darkness for 500 years.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.604
Frightened animals?

26:04.481 --> 26:07.234
I hope that you meet
my real father one day.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.154
Look, I get it, Kofun.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.657
It wasn't any easier for me
when I first got here.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.160
But what you don't realize is that
even though you can see,

26:17.244 --> 26:19.621
you've been living out there
in the darkness your whole life.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.874
Just give it some time.

26:23.542 --> 26:26.378
Jerlamarel may not have raised us,
but he made us with purpose.

26:26.461 --> 26:29.172
-To bring light back into the world.
-That's right.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.593
You can start by taking this shovel.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.443
The Witchfinders murdered your people.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.695
We grieve for them.

26:52.446 --> 26:55.490
Here, too, the Valeyas have known
the pain of their souls.

26:56.074 --> 26:59.661
But my people worry that you
may lead Tamacti Jun back to us.

27:00.662 --> 27:05.959
Our child is badly hurt
and in need of healers.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.713
She won't last a day in the wild.

27:11.173 --> 27:13.008
Would you turn her away?

27:16.428 --> 27:17.888
You may leave the girl.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.809
But you two must agree to make tracks
leading away from here.

27:23.435 --> 27:24.853
You have my word.

27:26.104 --> 27:28.190
Brave, Bow Lion.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.568
Where will you go?

27:31.652 --> 27:33.403
God Flame knows.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.659
But the Valeya will be good to you.

27:42.037 --> 27:44.373
You must make a life for yourself here.

27:45.499 --> 27:49.961
There's nothing for you out there,
Bow Lion.

27:54.841 --> 27:58.220
Your mother is in your spirit.

28:00.555 --> 28:05.936
I dream a long life for you, dear girl.

28:06.436 --> 28:08.939
With many journeys yet to come.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.151
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet-chet.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.128
My brave lion.

28:36.258 --> 28:37.884
I stand with Baba.

28:52.316 --> 28:54.026
We'll never forget you, Bow.

28:57.821 --> 29:01.241
It's just you and me now, you big lump.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.662
What gods did you anger to deserve this?

29:09.583 --> 29:15.213
My mother taught me very sad days
last no longer than very happy days.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.716
She a presage too?

29:18.425 --> 29:21.511
No. She liked to get drunk.

29:22.429 --> 29:25.432
Which makes the lesson
no less valuable on that account.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.310
It's starting to get cold.

29:29.019 --> 29:32.522
We should start a fire.
I'll find something to kill.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.230
Colonel. This is a surprise.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.232
Is it?

30:15.607 --> 30:17.609
I would think
you would've been expecting me

30:17.693 --> 30:19.653
with the arrival of Baba Voss' children.

30:19.736 --> 30:22.197
In fact, I was a little concerned
you didn't contact me

30:22.280 --> 30:24.199
as you promised the general.

30:24.825 --> 30:27.160
Did you think my archers
wouldn't send word?

30:27.244 --> 30:30.247
I was getting around to it.
It's been a little hectic around here.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.833
Well, we're here now.
Where are my prisoners?

30:34.960 --> 30:39.381
Tell me, why is the general so fixated
on these children specifically?

30:39.464 --> 30:41.675
It's my job
to follow the general's orders,

30:41.758 --> 30:44.136
not to question them,
not to understand them.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.930
You might wanna consider that.

30:47.264 --> 30:52.185
Well, unlike you, I do not work
for the general. We're partners.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.397
Tell yourself that if it helps.

31:00.152 --> 31:04.364
Are you absolutely certain these are
Baba Voss' children we're getting?

31:04.781 --> 31:08.785
It's a long way to Trivantes
and we wouldn't want any mistakes.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.542
You are getting his daughter, Haniwa.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.794
-And the son?
-No.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.009
Are we going to have a problem here?

31:26.178 --> 31:29.806
No problem at all.
As long as the boy stays here.

31:31.350 --> 31:36.730
Might I remind you, my family and I
are armed and you are outnumbered.

31:38.190 --> 31:42.235
Well, then,
I guess the girl will have to do.

31:44.529 --> 31:45.614
Kofun?

31:47.157 --> 31:48.408
You don't have to sneak around.

31:48.492 --> 31:51.286
They're talking about us.
Why are they talking about us?

31:51.370 --> 31:52.412
What?

32:25.570 --> 32:26.738
Haniwa!

32:28.073 --> 32:29.116
Kofun!

32:29.199 --> 32:30.367
Baba!

33:17.331 --> 33:18.623
Open the door!

33:19.458 --> 33:20.667
Help!

33:22.711 --> 33:24.046
Open the door!

33:24.838 --> 33:26.173
Let me out!

33:30.344 --> 33:31.636
Let me out!

33:35.724 --> 33:39.770
Haniwa! Haniwa, Haniwa! No!

33:39.853 --> 33:42.814
Open the door! Open the door!

33:47.653 --> 33:48.654
Go.

33:48.737 --> 33:49.821
Giddyap.

33:52.866 --> 33:53.909
Giddyap.

33:57.037 --> 33:58.121
You all right?

33:59.206 --> 34:02.376
She was my daughter. Your sister.

34:03.543 --> 34:06.380
I just-- I didn't see another way.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.633
It's a shame.
She had such great potential.

34:12.094 --> 34:13.387
What about Kofun?

34:14.846 --> 34:15.972
What did he see?

34:16.973 --> 34:17.974
Enough.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.357
I waited so long for these two.

34:26.441 --> 34:27.859
It's very upsetting.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.787
You did what you could.

34:40.789 --> 34:41.915
Not enough.

34:43.792 --> 34:47.379
More than she would've done for you
if the roles were reversed.

34:49.297 --> 34:50.966
Are you certain about that?

34:51.049 --> 34:53.093
Yes. Very.

34:54.219 --> 34:57.472
And, though maybe not at this moment,

34:57.556 --> 35:00.517
on some level, so are you.

35:04.187 --> 35:06.148
You are not to blame.

35:08.442 --> 35:10.527
And if your father was here, he'd agree.

35:15.364 --> 35:16.658
I'll make sure to be quick.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.181
Witchfinder?

35:41.350 --> 35:47.564
You have been a fixture in my life
for as long as I can remember.

35:48.397 --> 35:52.027
It'll be nearly unthinkable
not having your counsel

35:52.110 --> 35:54.571
in whatever future life
I'm about to step into.

36:00.243 --> 36:02.079
I've made some additional remarks.

36:02.913 --> 36:05.457
Assuming they have my sister's blessing,

36:05.540 --> 36:08.126
I'll read them to the troops
to begin the transition.

36:13.674 --> 36:16.551
My abdication.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.935
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

36:26.687 --> 36:27.938
Get away from him!

36:33.527 --> 36:34.695
Tamacti Jun.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.573
What did you do?

36:40.158 --> 36:41.326
What did you do?

36:55.590 --> 36:57.384
Thank you for your service.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.059
Sibeth, no.

37:07.060 --> 37:08.103
What have you done?

37:08.186 --> 37:09.980
Maghra, once a dog bites,

37:10.063 --> 37:12.274
no matter how loyal
you remember him once being,

37:12.357 --> 37:15.027
no matter your fondness for him,
he must be put down.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.987
-You've killed us both.
-Hardly.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.239
His army waits outside,
and when they find out--

37:19.323 --> 37:21.408
No, no, no, no. Not his.

37:21.491 --> 37:23.076
He just borrowed it.

37:23.452 --> 37:25.162
And they will hear the truth,

37:25.704 --> 37:30.208
that his guilt over the injuries
I sustained was simply too great to go on.

37:30.667 --> 37:34.421
He took his own life
according to the Old Way.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.716
A loyal servant to the end.

37:39.343 --> 37:42.262
Obviously, if you and I
were to tell conflicting stories,

37:42.346 --> 37:43.805
it would only cloud that truth.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.975
Confusion would set in, chaos, and then,
yes, we probably both lose our heads.

37:47.392 --> 37:51.229
Or we walk out of here together

37:51.313 --> 37:53.732
and deliver the message,
in which I'll explain

37:53.815 --> 37:58.278
that in this time of crisis, I will lead
my soldiers with my sister at my side.

37:58.945 --> 38:01.990
The first time in my reign
that I'll rule with her counsel.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.413
Don't be frightened.

38:09.581 --> 38:10.874
I'm here.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.377
I am right here.

38:17.255 --> 38:19.091
So much is about to change.

38:37.150 --> 38:39.736
Get off! Let go! Go!

38:40.654 --> 38:41.822
Calm down, Kofun.

38:42.447 --> 38:43.865
What did you do with my sister?

38:43.949 --> 38:45.117
Your sister is fine.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.910
You gave her to the Trivantians.

38:46.994 --> 38:49.746
The Trivantians are not the monsters
you were raised to fear.

38:49.830 --> 38:51.748
If it was not for my partnership
with them,

38:51.832 --> 38:55.752
this place, my family, would all have
been killed long ago by the queen.

38:56.962 --> 38:59.756
With our vision and the Trivantian army,

38:59.840 --> 39:03.010
we can conquer the queen once and for all.

39:03.093 --> 39:04.886
That will take years,

39:05.303 --> 39:09.224
but soon we will control the most
powerful military on the continent.

39:09.975 --> 39:13.478
We will no longer be hunted like dogs,
but seen as gods.

39:14.479 --> 39:16.315
But it will take a sacrifice.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.489
Kofun, my son. I--

39:25.365 --> 39:28.201
I'm not your son, you crazy fuck!

39:28.827 --> 39:30.620
Shut your mouth.

39:32.039 --> 39:34.499
You do not deserve the blessings
you've been given.

39:51.391 --> 39:55.687
Take him out the back way.
I do not want the children to see him.

40:01.818 --> 40:03.236
I'm very sorry.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.490
You'll be taken to the outskirts
of the facility, then you're free to go.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.452
What about my sister?

40:12.412 --> 40:13.997
What about my sister?

40:14.081 --> 40:18.043
What about my sister?
What about my sister?

40:19.002 --> 40:21.421
Take everyone downstairs
and organize the larder.

40:21.838 --> 40:23.382
Await my call.

40:23.465 --> 40:25.759
I do not want the children to hear him.

41:16.018 --> 41:18.103
-Hey!
-Hey! Hey!

41:18.520 --> 41:20.439
Dad. On your right.
On your right. On your right.

41:21.606 --> 41:22.607
On your left!

41:23.317 --> 41:24.318
Wall! Wall!

41:28.780 --> 41:31.241
-We here?
-Yeah, we're here.

42:02.522 --> 42:04.316
Jerlamarel!

42:08.612 --> 42:10.489
Jerlamarel!

42:11.114 --> 42:12.866
Where are you?

42:18.455 --> 42:20.457
You're not hiding from me, are you?

42:24.711 --> 42:26.046
Do you see me?

42:29.591 --> 42:31.009
'Cause I smell you.

42:32.219 --> 42:36.598
Hiding in your filth like a fucking rat.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.647
Is this your House of Enlightenment?

42:45.607 --> 42:47.025
There's no trees.

42:49.319 --> 42:50.529
No air.

42:52.406 --> 42:56.493
Just the putrid stench of things rotting.

42:59.579 --> 43:05.335
Your vision and all your knowledge
is a disease that wiped out your kind.

43:05.752 --> 43:07.254
But you feel nothing.

43:07.713 --> 43:09.631
You fools know nothing.

43:14.428 --> 43:17.681
Come on out and fight me
like a fucking man, you coward.

43:18.515 --> 43:21.893
Baba Voss. It doesn't need to be this way.

43:26.523 --> 43:31.695
You gave my baby girl to the Trivantians.

43:31.778 --> 43:33.989
It's not my fault. It's yours.

43:34.072 --> 43:37.326
The general only wanted her
because he thinks she's your daughter.

43:40.495 --> 43:41.663
What general?

43:46.418 --> 43:47.586
Edo Voss.

43:51.590 --> 43:52.591
Edo.

43:53.008 --> 43:54.134
Your brother.

43:56.094 --> 43:57.804
And you just gave her to him?

43:57.888 --> 43:59.556
I had no choice.

43:59.639 --> 44:04.478
What kind of man waits 17 years
to meet his children only to betray them?

44:04.561 --> 44:09.066
I am fighting for the entire human race!
Sacrifices must be made!

44:10.651 --> 44:12.444
They're my children. You hurt them!

44:12.527 --> 44:14.363
They are not your children.

44:15.238 --> 44:19.117
They were made to fulfill a destiny
you couldn't possibly understand.

44:19.201 --> 44:20.410
Is that right?

44:42.599 --> 44:44.559
I'm gonna tear your fucking head off!

44:45.811 --> 44:47.187
No, you won't.

44:53.235 --> 44:55.112
You fuck. You fuck.

44:59.282 --> 45:01.910
You can't possibly think
you can defeat me.

45:01.994 --> 45:04.871
Oh. I'm stupid like that.

45:24.391 --> 45:26.310
Where are you? Fucking coward.

45:54.504 --> 45:56.131
It's a weapon of the ancients.

45:57.341 --> 46:00.177
Much more efficient
than your arrows and swords.

46:03.388 --> 46:04.806
I know what a gun is.

46:05.807 --> 46:08.310
It's a weapon of choice
for men with no balls.

46:36.672 --> 46:38.590
You can't win, Baba Voss.

46:39.007 --> 46:41.301
You live in a world of perpetual darkness.

46:41.802 --> 46:47.099
I belong to a future where you and
your kind must be left behind forever.

46:55.607 --> 46:59.027
Oh, no. Now, you're in my world.

47:06.034 --> 47:07.035
Where are you?

47:10.747 --> 47:11.832
Everywhere.

47:21.758 --> 47:23.510
No one leaves until I get back.

47:24.344 --> 47:26.346
I smell your blood, Jerlamarel.

47:27.556 --> 47:28.598
Yeah?

47:29.558 --> 47:30.684
And your fear.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.314
Do you smell yours?

47:35.397 --> 47:38.734
I'm going to bleed you out,
little by little.

47:41.862 --> 47:45.532
So you can feel the life
draining from you.

47:51.371 --> 47:52.539
A coward's death.

47:54.249 --> 47:55.417
Slow and wet.

48:42.172 --> 48:43.173
Chet-chet.

48:45.550 --> 48:48.220
Look at me. Look at me.

48:49.471 --> 48:50.639
You did this.

48:51.014 --> 48:52.516
Wait, wait, wait.

48:52.599 --> 48:54.226
Please, please! Please don't!

49:13.870 --> 49:14.913
Kofun?

49:17.165 --> 49:18.166
Yes.

49:20.877 --> 49:21.878
Are you okay?

49:23.130 --> 49:24.172
No, I'm not.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.606
The Witchfinder is dead!

49:42.858 --> 49:44.526
He was the last of his kind.

49:46.486 --> 49:50.949
A soldier with the honor to recognize

49:52.451 --> 49:55.996
that having failed his queen, his kingdom,

49:56.621 --> 49:59.541
his gods, and himself...

50:01.668 --> 50:06.715
he had no choice
but to take a soldier's death,

50:07.299 --> 50:11.303
which demands a release
in the traditional manner.

50:15.724 --> 50:17.434
A hero to the end.

50:22.606 --> 50:26.735
Who leaves us with the responsibility

50:27.611 --> 50:29.863
to live up to his noble sacrifice.

50:33.325 --> 50:34.868
So we forge ahead.

50:37.204 --> 50:39.581
We will build a new world for ourselves.

50:41.416 --> 50:44.044
A world without hardship.

50:46.588 --> 50:48.298
A world without want.

50:49.883 --> 50:51.927
-A world without--
-A world without fear.

50:52.719 --> 50:54.721
A world without hate.

50:55.472 --> 50:57.891
A world without superstition.

50:59.142 --> 51:03.313
A new path unlike any we've
ever traveled before.

51:05.607 --> 51:10.821
And in this new world that
Tamacti Jun's sacrifice made possible,

51:13.031 --> 51:18.704
there may be no need
for Witchfinders at all.

51:26.003 --> 51:30.048
Sergeant, we go to the Lavender Road.

51:46.648 --> 51:47.941
That was interesting.

51:51.320 --> 51:54.865
A world with no Witchfinders
would mean a world with no witches.

51:54.948 --> 51:56.700
We're gonna find my family.

51:57.367 --> 51:59.119
That's not up for discussion.

51:59.953 --> 52:05.125
And when we do, I will not have them
labeled as fugitives by our army.

52:06.752 --> 52:08.045
"Our" army?

52:09.004 --> 52:10.130
Isn't it?

52:13.425 --> 52:15.886
So, the road ahead
leads to a sighted kingdom.

52:16.803 --> 52:19.848
I suppose I shall need a sighted king

52:19.931 --> 52:23.018
in such a world
to give me sighted children.

52:25.354 --> 52:27.939
Having been rejected by Jerlamarel once,

52:28.023 --> 52:30.567
you can understand
why I'd not make the overture again.

52:36.573 --> 52:38.158
What are you suggesting?

52:40.077 --> 52:41.703
Tell me more about your son.

52:59.805 --> 53:00.806
Chet-chet.

54:55.212 --> 54:56.463
What do you see, my boy?

54:58.256 --> 55:00.258
Towers of God bone.

55:01.218 --> 55:03.345
More than I've ever seen in my life.

55:04.596 --> 55:05.931
There's smoke.

55:09.601 --> 55:10.602
Paris.

55:11.478 --> 55:12.813
She's here.

55:22.197 --> 55:23.824
Let's go get your sister.
