WEBVTT

00:29.780 --> 00:30.781
Mush!

01:00.310 --> 01:02.980
Now, that's a cup of coffee. It's strong.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.857
Good though.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.941
I got you something.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.360
I love somethings.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
What is this?

01:14.533 --> 01:17.452
Sense and Sensibility. I love this book.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.371
I loved the movie more though.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.292
Wait, is this, like,
a first edition or something?

01:23.292 --> 01:27.379
- Yep. And it's signed.
- No.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.552
"Keeley, you go girl! Jane Austen."

01:36.346 --> 01:39.349
Did you destroy a priceless artifact
just to make me laugh?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.853
One, it wasn't priceless.
It was actually very expensive.

01:43.437 --> 01:47.316
Two, I can get very jealous,
and I hate the idea of you regifting that.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.235
And three, no, I didn't. That is all her.

01:50.235 --> 01:54.615
And she really wants you to "go girl,"
so, you better go girl.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.992
I'll go. Watch me.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.162
Come here. Thank you.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.455
You're welcome.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.628
Hey, Cindy. How are you? Good.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.048
How you doing, brother? You okay?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.677
- Good morning, Faridah.
- Morning, Sam.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.556
Okay. I have a favor to ask.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.060
Do we have an open table on Friday night?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.944
You're being serious? No.

02:31.944 --> 02:36.114
The restaurant is booked for months.
The waiting list is a lie we tell people.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.827
Okay. We have a very special guest
coming, so I need a "Ray Liotta" for one.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.038
I'll take care of it, take care of it.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.456
You're the best.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.750
- Okay. Thank you.
- Fuck you!

02:48.794 --> 02:50.170
If you will excuse me.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.387
- Is everything okay in here?
- I don't know.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.305
- Is everything okay in here?
- Yes, Chef!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.224
- Everything's fine.
- So who were you talking to?

03:02.224 --> 03:05.143
- Brinda Barot.
- And was she here?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.061
No, poo poo head.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.272
A refugee boat's coming in,

03:08.272 --> 03:10.983
and our home secretary
wants to send them away.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.694
- Why would she do that?
- Because she's the devil.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.778
- Right?
- Yes, Chef!

03:15.696 --> 03:17.948
Okay, listen. Brinda Barot sucks for sure,

03:17.948 --> 03:20.868
but, Simi,
it's way too early to be this angry.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.163
Maybe you should start drinking
coffee again. It's better for your heart.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.164
Why are you here?

03:26.164 --> 03:29.459
Is there a photo shoot
for Footballer Passion Project Magazine,

03:29.459 --> 03:30.544
or something?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.130
No, I just stopped by
to make sure everything was okay.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.756
Everything is perfect.

03:37.801 --> 03:38.844
What about the spoons?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.268
They don't match.

03:48.103 --> 03:53.734
Samuel, if the food is good, which it is,
no one cares about the spoons.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.862
- Am I right?
- Yes, Chef!

04:00.866 --> 04:04.745
You know, just...
My father is coming this weekend.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.790
So-- Fuck. And I just--
I want everything to be perfect.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.002
He's coming all the way from Nigeria.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.254
If this bitch lets him in.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.200
All right, fellas, focus up here.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.745
Right about now,
Roy's gonna make things dark...

04:48.705 --> 04:52.000
so that Coach Beard here
can shed some light. Coach.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.840
At the 1974 World Cup,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.509
the tiny country of the Netherlands
came out of nowhere

05:00.509 --> 05:02.511
and made it all the way
to the World Cup Final,

05:02.511 --> 05:05.430
playing the home team,
heavily favored Germany.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.309
Those Dutch hippies scored before
the Germans even touched the ball.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.228
Yeah, but Holland lost that game.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.649
Correct. But along the way, they won
the hearts of fans all around the world

05:16.233 --> 05:22.322
with a style of play-- dare I say,
a philosophy-- called Total Football.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.117
Which, coincidentally, Coach dreamed up

05:25.117 --> 05:27.411
in a barbecue-sauce-related hallucination
just last week.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.540
No, it's true. But hey, it's not about me.
Go on, keep shining.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.125
The best player on that team

05:33.125 --> 05:35.210
and the godfather of Total Football
was this guy.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.879
Can anyone tell me who this is?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.881
That's Tim Robinson
from I Think You Should Leave.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.593
No. It is Dutch football legend,
Johan Cruyff.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.719
It's pronounced Cruijff.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.555
My apologies. With Total Football,

05:46.555 --> 05:49.099
- Johan Cruijff...
- That's it.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.311
...took his small club Ajax
to three straight European titles.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.522
Now, he later became a coach,
first at Ajax,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.858
and then he took Total Football
to Barcelona,

05:57.858 --> 06:00.736
where he won the Spanish championship
four years in a row.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.447
Now a central cog of that team
was an industrious

06:03.447 --> 06:06.283
but brilliant midfielder
named Josep Guardiola.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.202
AKA Pep.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.579
Look at that head of hair.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.663
God had to take it away

06:11.663 --> 06:13.332
just to balance things out, you know?

06:13.332 --> 06:17.211
Pep became a coach as well,
honing his own version of Total Football

06:17.211 --> 06:21.131
that he took to Barcelona
and Bayern Munich,

06:21.131 --> 06:25.427
eventually landing
at our great white whale, Manchester City.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.682
Where he briefly coached
a very talented young player...

06:32.559 --> 06:34.895
until that beautiful dum-dum quit
to go do a reality show.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.981
I was robbed!

06:39.191 --> 06:42.986
Total Football is about constant movement.
Players are no longer in set positions.

06:42.986 --> 06:46.657
Defenders are free to attack.
Attackers are trusted to defend.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.952
It's about taking risks
and supporting each other's choices.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.621
Like when your friend wears something new
and outside his comfort zone,

06:52.621 --> 06:55.249
and instead of ignoring it,
everybody pays him a compliment.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.626
By the way, great hat, Ash.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.212
Oh, yeah.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.714
- It's pretty sweet.
- Yeah, it frames his face nicely.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.759
Exactly. Total Football is about
letting go of your baggage

07:05.759 --> 07:07.219
and trusting your intuition.

07:07.219 --> 07:12.558
It's jazz. It's Motown. It's Mamet.
It's Pinter. It's Einstein.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.351
It's Keurig. It's Gaga!

07:14.351 --> 07:17.855
It's my mother proudly displaying
her vibrator on the bedside table!

07:18.480 --> 07:22.860
It's about throwing off the constraints
put upon you by society and by yourselves!

07:24.111 --> 07:25.529
We all know football is life.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.948
But a beautiful life...

07:29.491 --> 07:30.784
is Total Football.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.498
That's good. That's you right there.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.250
Give it up, that's Coach.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.335
All right, fellas, we wanted y'all to know

07:40.335 --> 07:42.379
a little bit about the history
of Total Football,

07:42.379 --> 07:44.339
because that's what we're gonna
start playing here.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.675
What? No. No, wait. What?

07:46.675 --> 07:51.013
Oi! You turn those frowns upside down
'cause we're fucking doing this.

07:51.013 --> 07:54.224
We're gonna drill it, we're gonna train it
and then in a couple of months,

07:54.224 --> 07:56.810
we're taking Total Football
to the fucking pitch.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.937
No, actually we're gonna do it
this Saturday against Arsenal.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.023
- Well, that's fucking mental.
- No, it'll be fine.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.150
Hush your butts!

08:04.193 --> 08:06.278
Hush your butt! Let's go. come on.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.239
No, no, no. Cool it.
It's gonna be fine. I don't wanna hear it.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.033
- Let's go, come on!
- I hear butts!

08:11.033 --> 08:13.744
Hush your butt, hush your butt,
hush your butt. Gotta hush them butts.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.704
Isaac, come on, be a captain.
Get that butt hushed.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.789
I don't wanna hear it, Van Damme.
Hush your butt.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.963
Ms. Jones, we have a problem. The--
Oh, no, wait, actually, no, we don't.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.175
Sorry, sort of force of habit
or something.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.260
- I'm just dropping this off.
- Thank you.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.181
That's very lovely. May I?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.265
Yeah, of course, go.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.436
I never would've
thought that you liked books.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.899
I mean, that you collect first editions.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.068
Oh, no, I don't.
That was a gift from Jack.

08:46.568 --> 08:51.114
Wow. What a very nice gift
to receive. From your boss.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.326
She's not really my boss, right?
She's helping me execute my vision.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.454
It must be nice to have
such a generous friend that,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.499
delivers expensive gifts
to your place of work.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.210
No, no. She gave it to me this morning
when we had breakfast together.

09:04.211 --> 09:08.549
Coffee. We had a coffee together.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.385
At a coffee shop.
But we didn't arrive together.

09:11.385 --> 09:15.055
We came from separate places,
and we met there.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.850
She was late actually.

09:17.850 --> 09:21.061
Well, I had a warm yogurt
on the tube in my pajamas.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.771
You take the tube in your pajamas?

09:22.771 --> 09:25.274
Yeah, sometimes, yes.
When I want to beat the rush.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.694
And then I just get changed
in the toilets when I get here.

09:29.945 --> 09:30.946
Smart.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.240
- Ms. Jones.
- Barbara.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.451
- Hey, Siri.
- Yes, Wunderkind?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.536
Could you set a reminder
for tomorrow at 7:00 p.m.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.121
for Nicole's birthday dinner? Thank you.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.583
<i>Okay, your reminder
is set for tomorrow at 7:00.</i>

10:30.297 --> 10:32.299
- Siri.
- Yes, Wunderkind?

10:33.175 --> 10:35.511
How can you tell if a girl likes you
or is just being nice to you?

10:36.553 --> 10:37.554
<i>You can't.</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:44.186
So now I'm starting to get
all these subtle, little hints from Jane.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.813
Like, certain magazines left
on the coffee table

10:46.813 --> 10:49.107
and always hearing about her friends
who are doing it.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.151
Well, marriage is a big commitment,
you know?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.486
No, I'm talking about pegging.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.613
Well, still.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.114
Wait, what magazines?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.785
- Here you go, lads.
- Thanks, Mae.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.912
- You okay, Mae?
- No.

11:01.912 --> 11:07.084
We win, this place is packed.
We lose, it's like this.

11:08.293 --> 11:12.673
I actually prefer it. You can finally hear
yourself think in here.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.383
Fuck off.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.267
Hey, Lasso. We wanted to apologize.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.644
- What for?
- For getting all soft on you.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.397
Yeah, we humanized you
and lost all objectivity.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.899
Main reason why farmers
don't name their livestock.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.735
And why we don't learn the names
of Baz's brother's girlfriends anymore.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.028
Because he's a male whore.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.906
Exactly.
So we're gonna backslide a little bit.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.617
Now what the fuck are you doing
to our team, wanker?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.244
- Okay.
- You-- Well-- Now, hold on,

11:42.244 --> 11:43.537
hold on, hold on, Coach.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.123
Well, I tell you what, fellas.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.251
Why don't you come watch
training tomorrow? See for yourselves.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.338
We ain't running a chocolate factory
or Deutsche Bank.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.757
We got nothing to hide from y'all.
See you tomorrow?

11:56.967 --> 11:59.386
Yeah. You will.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.849
What?

12:03.849 --> 12:06.018
- Should I wear a suit?
- I'm definitely gonna take a shower.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.103
- I mean, gotta do that. Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.481
Coach, you sure it's smart
to invite fans to our practices?

12:11.481 --> 12:15.068
It's their team. We're just borrowing it
for a little while. You know?

12:16.278 --> 12:17.321
Anyway,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.782
I guess marriage and pegging
aren't really that different.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.701
Yeah, it's all about compromise.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.179
- There he is!
- God! Sorry.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.807
The hottest coach in the league!

12:45.807 --> 12:46.808
Thank you.

12:46.808 --> 12:51.438
I won a lot of money off your lot.
So, keep it up. Please.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.731
Table for one?

12:53.315 --> 12:56.235
No, I thought I'd-- Just passing.
Is Jade working today? Do you know?

12:56.235 --> 12:58.695
No, she's off Tuesdays.
She goes to school.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.949
Or feeds her mum.
I don't listen, so I don't really know.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.368
Okay. Well, just say that I said hello.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.995
Actually, you know what,
don't say anything.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.375
Actually, no, do. Say, if you--

13:11.375 --> 13:14.086
No. Just don't say anything.
Unless she asks after me.

13:14.086 --> 13:16.213
In which case, just say that I said hello.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.550
- And why would she ask after you?
- Exactly. I don't kn--

13:20.050 --> 13:21.009
Thank you, Derek.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.972
Thank you. Bye. Yes, no, just-- Yeah.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.308
All right.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.645
- Hey, Trent.
- Hello, Ted.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.774
- Hey, Ted!
- Hey, fellas!

13:38.318 --> 13:39.528
The fuck are they doing here?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.531
I don't know. Ask Beard,
he's the one who invited them.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.120
All right, my Merry Pranksters.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.832
If we're gonna play Total Football,
there are four things we need to focus on.

13:51.832 --> 13:56.211
All right? Number one, conditioning.
Y'all gotta get into even better shape.

13:56.211 --> 14:00.215
Number two, versatility.
Number three, awareness.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.341
And number four...

14:02.676 --> 14:05.053
I don't know what that one is yet.
But I know it's important.

14:05.053 --> 14:08.765
Starting today, we're gonna have
to turn things up a notch around here.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.185
So I'ma hand it over
to your drill instructor,

14:11.185 --> 14:12.603
Sergeant Roy Kent.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.193
Whistle! On your feet, maggots!

14:21.528 --> 14:22.529
Right.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.241
Today you're gonna run
from end to end to end to end.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.285
But lucky for you, I'm in a good mood.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.831
So you've only gotta do that
for the whole fucking practice.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.541
Whistle.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.131
- Why doesn't he just use a whistle?
- He's allergic to metal.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.634
Football stars, they're just like us.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.011
Run!

14:49.640 --> 14:51.308
You sure you don't want a plastic whistle?

14:55.229 --> 14:56.647
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.320
- Cute flowers.
- Thanks.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.613
Yeah, daisies are my favorite.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.865
- And I thought I was.
- Wait!

15:12.287 --> 15:13.539
Why'd you do that?

15:13.539 --> 15:15.624
Shit, you're right, yeah.

15:18.544 --> 15:21.547
- No. Off. On. On?
- Keeley. Keeley.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.550
- On or off? Off? On or off?
- Keeley. Keeley, s--

15:24.550 --> 15:26.885
- On? On. Do you want it on or off?
- Keeley. Keeley.

15:26.885 --> 15:30.639
- On or off? Off? On? Off or on?
- Stop. Give it to me. Thank you.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.810
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.938
I am just not built
for a secret office romance.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.691
I'm used to everyone
knowing everything about me.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.401
Barbara saw the book that you gave me,

15:42.401 --> 15:44.903
and, I didn't think that I could
tell her that we were dating,

15:44.903 --> 15:46.488
because I don't want us to get in trouble.

15:46.488 --> 15:50.409
We can't get into trouble
'cause we are two consenting adults.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.370
And I'm get-away-with-murder rich, so...

15:53.996 --> 15:55.622
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.500
- Like who else? Name names.
- Everyone connected to Epstein.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.337
Keeley, I don't care if people
in the office know we're dating, do you?

16:02.880 --> 16:06.508
No, of course not. I just didn't know
how serious you were about this.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.468
Come with me.

16:09.970 --> 16:10.804
Okay.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.143
Hey, everyone. Quick announcement.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.811
Keeley and I are dating.

16:18.395 --> 16:23.358
And it's brand-new,
but I'm serious about it.

16:25.277 --> 16:29.573
And so both of us just wanted to let you
all know so that there were no secrets.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.910
'Cause it's all good.
I'm not crazy. She's not crazy.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.786
You're not crazy, right?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.247
Neither of us are crazy.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.376
But, if any of you have
any issues or concerns about this at all,

16:41.376 --> 16:45.881
please do not hesitate to come
and speak to me or Keeley or Barbara.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.382
Cool?

16:49.384 --> 16:50.427
Cool.

16:51.428 --> 16:55.224
And congratulations, Jack and Keeley.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.311
- Love is love, i-- Right.
- No, that's enough, Dan. Thank you.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.790
This is some of the best puking
I've ever seen.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.544
Yeah, me too. And we spend
most of our lives at the pub.

17:26.755 --> 17:31.844
All right. Nice job, gentlemen.
Okay, that's it for today.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.220
Now we scrimmage!

17:36.473 --> 17:38.350
Honestly, my jacket's still a bit canal-y.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.143
It's really bad.

17:41.687 --> 17:43.897
Okay, so, you never got his name?

17:45.232 --> 17:46.775
And you never told him yours?

17:48.694 --> 17:50.779
Yeah, see,
that part's not that weird to me.

17:50.779 --> 17:54.616
If you really didn't have sex
with the guy, now that is fucking bonkers.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.910
Look, what we shared, it just--

17:58.453 --> 18:01.665
It transcended sex. It was...

18:02.291 --> 18:03.959
- Magic.
- Gezellig.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.172
But, yeah, I would've liked
to have seen his penis.

18:10.299 --> 18:13.177
- It is so good to see you.
- You too.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.720
It has been way too long.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.097
Because I've lost you to another woman.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.892
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I am joking.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.228
So come on. How's it going?

18:23.228 --> 18:27.024
It is great. I mean, she is so cool.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.776
She's smart. Super foxy.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.570
She's an amazing gift-giver.

18:32.988 --> 18:36.950
Oh, my God, and the way she proclaimed
our relationship to the entire office.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.994
It was so fucking hot.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.748
I think she might be love bombing you.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.083
- She's "love what-ing" me?
- Love bombing.

18:45.709 --> 18:49.379
That's when you're bombarded
with expensive gifts and trips

18:49.379 --> 18:52.257
and grand gestures of love.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.218
They call it love bombing.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.762
- Who does?
- I don't know. They do.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.348
Those "they" out there that name stuff.

19:00.516 --> 19:04.811
But what I do know is that
on my second date with Rupert--

19:04.811 --> 19:06.355
Second date,

19:06.355 --> 19:08.607
he took me to a car showroom
and said, "Which one do you want?"

19:09.274 --> 19:10.651
I would fucking love that.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.110
What did you do?

19:12.110 --> 19:15.322
Well, I asked him if he was referring
to the cars or the beautiful saleswomen

19:15.322 --> 19:17.157
suddenly tripping over themselves
to help us.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.202
And?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.788
I drove home in a bloody lovely Jaguar,
of course.

19:24.122 --> 19:28.335
It just felt nice to be taken care of
for once.

19:31.755 --> 19:32.756
Look,

19:33.632 --> 19:36.218
I'm not saying that Jack is like Rupert.

19:36.885 --> 19:40.681
But sometimes shiny things can tarnish.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.058
I think it's fine.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.186
Okay, good. Good.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.897
Just trust yourself.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.693
I ignored so many red flags in my past.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.946
Yeah. Well, maybe we're love blind?

19:55.946 --> 19:57.447
Love blind. What's that?

19:57.447 --> 20:01.159
It's an emotional version of
color blindness where a person interprets

20:01.159 --> 20:04.872
red flags as giant green,
just-fucking-go-for-it flags.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.084
- Did you come up with that?
- Yeah, I did.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.546
Oh, my God. You're one of those
"they" that name stuff.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.757
- Shit, I think I might be.
- I think you might be.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.927
Sorry, excuse me.
Could we get the bill, please? Thank you.

20:18.927 --> 20:22.723
Actually, the bill was already
taken care of by Jack.

20:23.307 --> 20:24.892
She said she hopes
you both enjoyed your meal.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.436
What a massive surprise.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.438
- Wow, yeah.
- What?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.608
Well, then I think we ought to have
some tiramisu. Don't you?

20:32.608 --> 20:34.526
- Definitely.
- And two bottles

20:34.526 --> 20:38.739
of the '34 Château Cheval Blanc
Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru to go.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.616
And one for yourself.

20:47.831 --> 20:48.832
Happy birthday, Mum.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.127
Wow.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.462
I love it.

20:53.462 --> 20:56.089
Well, it was my vision,
but Uncle Nate made it happen.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.383
She was actually quite specific. So...

20:59.551 --> 21:02.137
Thank you, cheeky. Thanks, Nate.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.265
Let's have a look, love. It's lovely.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.809
So, come on.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.603
You're the hottest coach
in the Premier League,

21:09.603 --> 21:12.773
which makes me
the coolest lawyer in the firm.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.942
Please tell me you're hooking up
with girls left and right.

21:14.942 --> 21:20.280
Okay, I don't think this kind of talk
is appropriate for a young lady.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.282
- Who wants ice cream?
- I do.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.660
Great. Let's go to the corner shop.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.371
Ali, come with us.
Let them have their girl talk.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.250
Come on, love. See you in a little bit.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.376
Bye.

21:33.544 --> 21:35.295
Okay, tell me everything.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.966
Okay. Well, there's this girl I like.

21:38.966 --> 21:42.052
She's the hostess at Taste of Athens.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.181
She used to hate me, but now she--

21:46.181 --> 21:48.517
Well, I don't know.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.644
I've misread signals
from women before, but--

21:50.644 --> 21:53.772
I mean, how do you tell if a girl
likes you or is just being nice to you?

21:53.772 --> 21:54.940
You can't.

21:55.983 --> 21:58.861
But there is one surefire way to find out.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.863
- Right.
- Ask her out.

22:00.863 --> 22:03.156
No, I can't-- Can't do that. No.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.409
Come on, what is the worst
that could happen?

22:05.409 --> 22:07.327
Well, that she laughs
in my face and says no.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.162
And that I scurry away, humiliated,

22:09.162 --> 22:11.456
never to be allowed
in my favorite restaurant ever again.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.750
So that next time we have
some kind of family celebration,

22:13.750 --> 22:16.253
I'll just have to, you know,
sit on the pavement outside

22:16.253 --> 22:17.462
eating takeaway fish and chips,

22:17.462 --> 22:20.465
watching you through the window
like some Dickensian street urchin.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.050
Oh, my God.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.346
He's just like Dad.
You have to show him the map.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.515
No, your father would kill me.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.893
- Show him the map.
- What map?

22:35.939 --> 22:38.692
Your father and I went
to school together for years,

22:39.193 --> 22:43.530
but I didn't think he even knew I existed,
until he gave me this.

22:47.743 --> 22:52.372
"Distance between the places
that we were born, 4,125 miles.

22:52.372 --> 22:56.001
Distance between the places
that we were raised, 4,230 miles.

22:56.585 --> 23:00.422
Distance between
our dorms on campus, 1.3 miles.

23:00.422 --> 23:04.927
Distance between us on Friday night
at 8:00 p.m., hopefully one foot.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.553
Would you like to go on a date?"

23:09.932 --> 23:11.141
Stop waiting, Nathan.

23:11.141 --> 23:14.144
Yes, you could fail and be embarrassed
for a second.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.856
But you could also get married,
have two wonderful children

23:18.357 --> 23:20.901
and live happily ever after.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.113
- Oh, shit.
- We're back.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.449
Quick, distract him.

23:52.015 --> 23:55.310
<i>...that is carrying
a large group of refugees,</i>

23:55.310 --> 24:00.482
<i>including several women and children,
who are hoping to claim asylum in the UK.</i>

24:00.482 --> 24:01.567
What's going on?

24:02.234 --> 24:03.485
<i>...in Portsmouth.</i>

24:03.485 --> 24:05.571
<i>The boat is now kilometers
from Portsmouth Harbor,</i>

24:06.071 --> 24:09.283
<i>where its passengers, dozens of refugees,
hope to find sanctuary.</i>

24:09.283 --> 24:11.743
<i>Hundreds of supporters
await their arrival.</i>

24:11.743 --> 24:16.039
<i>While others, such as Home Secretary
Brinda Barot, had this to say.</i>

24:16.039 --> 24:20.669
<i>To anyone attempting to enter
our country illegally, I say this.</i>

24:21.420 --> 24:23.714
<i>"Go home. Britain is closed."</i>

24:23.714 --> 24:25.465
<i>Over the last few days--</i>

24:25.465 --> 24:27.968
- What a stupid idiot.
- What a piece of shit.

24:28.552 --> 24:31.054
You know, someone needs
to send her back to where she came from.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.849
- Her mother's butthole. Right?
- Yes, Chef!

24:33.849 --> 24:37.060
Or somebody could try and speak
to the better angels

24:37.060 --> 24:38.937
of this clearly misguided person.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.907
- Bitch.
- What?

24:50.490 --> 24:53.410
It should say, "Help make Britain
better than this bitch."

24:58.665 --> 25:00.209
I think I'll stick with mine.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.127
Yeah.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.056
- Hi.
- Hello there.

25:14.056 --> 25:15.307
Nate.

25:16.058 --> 25:19.353
There's something that I wanted
to ask you. Would you...

25:23.398 --> 25:24.775
Excuse me one moment.

25:27.069 --> 25:28.487
So sorry. Sorry.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.429
Actually, there's one thing
I need to do first. Sorry.

26:03.272 --> 26:05.524
Whistle. Bring it in.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.487
All right, fellas. How y'all feeling?

26:14.616 --> 26:16.910
Bumbercatch,
did you just puke whole Cheerios?

26:16.910 --> 26:19.872
Yes, Coach. I like to eat my breakfast
without chewing.

26:20.372 --> 26:23.876
To conserve my energy in case
an impending class war breaks out.

26:23.876 --> 26:25.460
Yeah, no, makes sense. I get it. Yeah.

26:26.044 --> 26:29.089
All right, gentlemen,
today we are gonna focus on versatility.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.800
Now, in Total Football,
you gotta constantly be asking yourself,

26:31.800 --> 26:34.261
"What does this situation need right now?"

26:34.261 --> 26:37.556
You know, do I need to drop back
and replace Jan Maas on defense?

26:37.556 --> 26:39.850
Or, you know, should I attack like Jamie?

26:39.850 --> 26:42.352
Or, you know, or do I lend Roy here
a piece of gum

26:42.352 --> 26:43.729
because his breath smells like dookie?

26:44.855 --> 26:46.940
Completely hypothetical.
Don't worry. You're fine, you're fine.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.985
All right? You gotta be able to jump in
anywhere at any time.

26:49.985 --> 26:52.446
And the way to do that well
is to understand

26:52.446 --> 26:56.700
and appreciate everyone's position
and every position's function.

26:56.700 --> 27:00.746
That's why we got our man, Beard,
replacing Will today as our kitman.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.418
Yeah. So when we get out here
and we scrimmage,

27:06.418 --> 27:09.171
y'all are gonna be swapping positions
with someone else. Yeah?

27:09.671 --> 27:12.549
For example, you know, Isaac,
we're gonna move you up to forward.

27:12.549 --> 27:15.010
And Dani, we're gonna drop you
back to defense. Got it?

27:15.010 --> 27:16.470
I'm gonna be Dani Rojas?

27:16.470 --> 27:19.389
That's right, Isaac.
And Dani is gonna be you. Make sense?

27:19.389 --> 27:21.517
We're gonna fuck 'em up, bruv.

27:21.517 --> 27:23.101
<i>Ay, Dios mios.</i>

27:23.101 --> 27:24.645
Y'all don't need to do the voices.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.980
- Come on.
- Okay, all right. Y'all can do the voices.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.357
Yeah.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.192
You go ahead, Roy. Help 'em out here.

27:30.192 --> 27:32.945
Roy's gonna be handing out paper
that's got someone's name on it.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.405
That's the name of the person
you're gonna do the swaparoo with.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.032
- Everybody understand?
- Yes, Coach.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.784
All right, good. Coach, I miss anything?

27:38.784 --> 27:42.204
- That's it, baby. Let's go!
- All right, let's do it. You heard him.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.751
Here we go, boys. Here we go.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.933
- There you go, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

28:02.933 --> 28:06.603
Hey, Coach.
There's been a mistake. I got me.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.105
Oh, no, Jamie, that's not a mistake.

28:08.105 --> 28:10.482
We just figured you'd wanna keep doing
what you do best for us.

28:10.482 --> 28:12.234
Playing striker and scoring goals, right?

28:15.988 --> 28:16.989
Yeah.

28:16.989 --> 28:19.241
- Yeah, if you want, yeah.
- Great.

28:22.828 --> 28:24.329
- Okay.
- Have fun out there.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.247
Yeah.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.377
That is yummy. What is this?

28:30.377 --> 28:31.461
Water.

28:32.337 --> 28:35.132
- I'm wide.
- Let's go! Let's go!

28:41.805 --> 28:44.933
Nice try, Van Damme.
You tried your best, and we love you.

28:45.976 --> 28:46.935
Baz, what are you doing?

28:46.935 --> 28:48.729
I'm switching positions with Paul.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.857
You know, unwavering positivity.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.484
Nice job with the water bottles,
Coach Beard.

28:57.571 --> 28:58.906
You fucking twats!

29:00.532 --> 29:02.951
I don't like it.
I actually prefer to be me.

29:06.330 --> 29:07.414
Hold up.

29:07.414 --> 29:10.584
Dani. Come on, now.
You're a center back, remember?

29:10.584 --> 29:13.128
That ain't your job taking corners.
That's what Isaac does now.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.464
- Right. Right, Coach.
- Isaac, come on, man. You're up.

29:15.464 --> 29:16.673
- All right, Isaac.
- Let's go.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.467
- You've got this, bruv.
- All right, now.

29:18.467 --> 29:20.260
Coach,
I ain't never taken a corner before.

29:20.260 --> 29:23.305
No, I know. That's 'cause
you were put into a box, Isaac.

29:23.305 --> 29:27.267
As a ten-year-old little boy with the
strength and facial hair of a grown man.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.146
The box of a center back who was
never allowed to take a corner kick.

29:31.146 --> 29:34.525
Well, my friend,
that box ceases to exist today.

29:35.067 --> 29:36.485
Yeah? Go on.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.570
What do you want me to do?

29:38.570 --> 29:40.906
I don't know.
Just kick the hell out of it.

29:42.324 --> 29:43.325
Okay.

29:58.757 --> 30:00.676
Hot! Hot tea.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.141
Just a bit outside.

30:44.303 --> 30:48.432
Ted. I just want to make sure
I have this right.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.685
You're gonna change tactics
at this stage in the season

30:51.685 --> 30:53.770
and replace it with a totally new method

30:53.770 --> 30:56.732
that the boys are clearly struggling
to understand.

30:57.566 --> 30:59.234
And you think this is a good idea?

31:00.319 --> 31:01.403
Well, Trent, the way I see it,

31:01.403 --> 31:04.239
it's kind of like taking a hike
with Robert Frost.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.574
It could go either way.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.211
- Get the fuck out of my chair.
- Yeah, no, of course. Sorry.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.205
Oh, my God.

32:01.338 --> 32:05.050
Okay, Greyhounds. Today we're talking
about number three, awareness.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.677
When you play Total Football,

32:06.677 --> 32:09.388
you gotta know what your teammates
are doing at all times.

32:09.388 --> 32:13.225
Constant movement requires
constant concentration, yeah?

32:13.225 --> 32:16.270
So if Sam makes a run through the center,
y'all gotta shift, right?

32:16.270 --> 32:18.814
And if Dani moves back on defense,
that means what?

32:18.814 --> 32:19.982
Hell has frozen over?

32:21.108 --> 32:22.317
No, it means you've gotta move up

32:22.317 --> 32:23.902
and support Dani's choice.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.154
Okay, any questions so far?

32:26.154 --> 32:28.156
Yeah, Coach. What's with the red string?

32:28.740 --> 32:29.741
Great question.

32:29.741 --> 32:33.245
In Japanese culture,
they have a myth where they believe

32:33.245 --> 32:37.207
that all soulmates are connected
by an invisible red string.

32:37.207 --> 32:40.460
And those strings are attached to each
of their little fingers.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.673
Okay, so why is it tied around our dicks?

32:44.673 --> 32:46.091
Yeah.

32:48.969 --> 32:50.888
Yeah. Well, you know, that was Roy's idea.

32:50.888 --> 32:53.473
But I'm pretty sure
the thought behind it is that

32:53.473 --> 32:56.518
it is nearly impossible to not be
fully aware of what your teammate's doing

32:56.518 --> 32:58.645
when y'all got a rope
tied around your dingdong.

32:59.271 --> 33:00.397
Am I right about that, Roy?

33:00.397 --> 33:02.274
Yeah. Something like that.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.027
Okay, great. Yeah.

33:05.027 --> 33:08.197
So we gonna get after this right now,
gonna do a full scrimmage at half speed.

33:08.197 --> 33:10.782
And I don't wanna see
them strings get too loose.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.160
And I'll leave it up to y'all
to make sure they don't get too tight.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.661
Do not leave my side.

33:15.454 --> 33:16.663
Shall we?

33:16.663 --> 33:18.332
"Dicks" on three. One, two, three.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.042
- Dicks.
- Come on, let's move.

33:23.253 --> 33:25.631
Figure it out! This is what we're doing.

33:45.442 --> 33:47.277
Fucking hell. Look at me, man.

33:49.154 --> 33:50.614
I'm attacking. I'm attacking.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.157
I'm defending. I'm defending.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.119
Jan!

33:57.913 --> 33:59.748
Look what Kent gave me.
In case we wanted to--

33:59.748 --> 34:00.874
- No.
- No fucking way.

34:03.293 --> 34:06.171
- You wanna give him a little space, Dani.
- Sorry, Coach, I am too scared.

34:10.926 --> 34:12.386
Bro, do you wanna...

34:40.706 --> 34:43.292
It's okay. His penis is okay.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.127
Oh, my God.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.629
I thought I just ripped Jamie's knob off.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

34:55.762 --> 34:56.763
Okay.

36:07.626 --> 36:08.502
Hi!

36:08.502 --> 36:09.586
Hi.

36:12.089 --> 36:14.466
Sorry that I am late.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.677
I'm in no rush. I got you something.

36:16.677 --> 36:17.928
I don't want it.

36:18.595 --> 36:19.513
Sorry.

36:19.513 --> 36:23.642
I'm sure whatever it is, it is incredibly
thoughtful and mind-blowingly generous.

36:24.142 --> 36:25.018
But I don't want it.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.396
- Keeley, I just got you a--
- No, I don't even wanna know what it is.

36:27.396 --> 36:29.273
No. I just wanna hang out one time

36:29.273 --> 36:31.525
where it doesn't feel
like you're sweeping me off my feet.

36:31.525 --> 36:33.610
Okay.
Sorry for sweeping you off your feet.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.237
No. Hey, I didn't mean--

36:35.237 --> 36:39.658
No. It's okay. I get it.
It's absolutely what I'm doing.

36:39.658 --> 36:44.288
I'm coming on too fast or too strong,
I'm sorry. I'll back off.

36:44.288 --> 36:45.706
But just a little bit.

36:47.541 --> 36:51.545
It was a croissant. I got you a croissant.

36:56.008 --> 36:58.218
Oi. You're incredible.

36:58.802 --> 37:01.597
But you've gotta let me do something
for you every once in a while.

37:03.182 --> 37:04.057
Deal.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.143
Thank you.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.938
But it better be fucking amazing.

37:17.404 --> 37:18.780
It's the last one, I swear.

37:21.325 --> 37:22.534
Verdict?

37:22.534 --> 37:24.494
It's a really, really good croissant.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.410
Would you like to go on a date with me?

38:06.036 --> 38:07.246
Yes.

38:08.997 --> 38:11.875
Good.

38:13.752 --> 38:16.088
There wasn't anything alive in there,
was there?

38:16.672 --> 38:19.424
Oh, no. No, no. No, not at all.

38:20.467 --> 38:21.635
If you say so.

39:45.344 --> 39:46.261
There you go, sir.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.402
I've given this a lot of thought.

40:02.986 --> 40:09.493
Next time we do this drill, we tie
multiple guys' dicks to one guy's dick.

40:09.493 --> 40:10.577
Yeah?

40:13.288 --> 40:14.706
That was a one-shot deal, Roy.

40:14.706 --> 40:17.292
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we cooked that whole bird already, Coach.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.211
Shame.

40:20.754 --> 40:22.422
So, Ted.

40:23.173 --> 40:25.008
- This number four.
- Yes, sir.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.594
- You haven't said what it is yet.
- No, ma'am.

40:27.594 --> 40:30.389
- But you know what it is?
- I don't actually.

40:31.139 --> 40:32.474
- What about you, Coach?
- I'm agnostic.

40:32.474 --> 40:34.393
- Roy?
- I don't fucking know.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.645
Number four has yet to reveal itself.

40:36.645 --> 40:37.855
There is no number four?

40:37.855 --> 40:39.314
Like the man once said,

40:39.314 --> 40:42.025
"Sometimes you gotta leave space
to let God walk into the room."

40:42.651 --> 40:43.819
So, number four is God?

40:43.819 --> 40:45.529
Oh, no. I don't think so. Coach?

40:45.529 --> 40:47.197
- I'm an atheist.
- Roy?

40:47.197 --> 40:48.282
I fucking hope not.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.996
Oi, man, you're ten minutes late,
yeah? That's gonna be a hundo, all right?

40:55.998 --> 40:57.124
The fuck's wrong with you?

40:57.124 --> 40:58.542
I'll tell you what's wrong.

40:58.542 --> 41:01.378
The world is full of evil people
who do shitty things.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.797
But I can't deal with that because I have
to kick a little ball around.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.801
Which those same people love me for!

41:08.635 --> 41:11.972
That is until I fuck up
or I miss a penalty.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.849
Or I decide to fight back,

41:14.349 --> 41:17.102
and then they're just gonna wanna
ship me back wherever I fucking came from.

41:17.102 --> 41:18.187
Samuel!

41:37.998 --> 41:39.208
It's okay.

41:42.961 --> 41:44.713
You know, I still want to go see it.

41:44.713 --> 41:47.257
No. I can't take you there.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.967
No. Not the way it looks now.

41:49.593 --> 41:51.887
Do you know
how long it will take you to reopen?

41:52.763 --> 41:54.139
I don't know if I will.

41:54.139 --> 41:56.141
- Samuel.
- What?

41:56.141 --> 42:00.020
Why? For who? Just so
somebody can go and trash it again.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.939
You do it for yourself.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.399
For your friend Simi.

42:05.067 --> 42:08.111
For all those people who want
a taste of home when they are away.

42:09.363 --> 42:10.989
Follow your heart, Samuel.

42:10.989 --> 42:13.033
Anger will only weaken you.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.744
Yeah. Okay.

42:16.245 --> 42:19.289
But if you really want to piss off
the people who did this,

42:20.582 --> 42:21.625
forgive them.

42:21.625 --> 42:22.835
What?

42:22.835 --> 42:25.629
Forgive them. Big whoop.

42:25.629 --> 42:27.297
- Big whoop?
- Big whoop.

42:30.342 --> 42:33.554
My son, listen to me.

42:34.221 --> 42:38.433
Don't fight back. Fight forward.

42:43.021 --> 42:44.356
Thank you, Daddy.

42:49.987 --> 42:51.905
Do you think I should invest
in security cameras?

42:51.905 --> 42:54.032
Hell yes. And gates.

42:54.032 --> 42:55.868
Please tell me you have insurance.

42:55.868 --> 42:56.910
I have insurance.

42:57.494 --> 43:00.330
Thank God. Otherwise,
your mother would have killed me.

43:02.291 --> 43:05.127
- Are you gonna have any trouble?
- No. Insurance!

43:07.504 --> 43:09.298
Hey. I'm sorry to interrupt y'all.

43:10.090 --> 43:11.967
Sam,
we're getting ready to start out there.

43:11.967 --> 43:15.095
But, you know, if you wanna sit out today,
I totally understand.

43:15.679 --> 43:18.056
- Thank you, Coach.
- No, he's going to practice.

43:20.726 --> 43:23.437
- Okay. Well, you better go change then.
- I'm getting ready to change.

43:24.146 --> 43:25.314
Uh-huh. Okay.

43:26.899 --> 43:28.400
It's really nice to finally meet you, sir.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.776
You too.

43:30.485 --> 43:32.362
You know,
I almost wore that exact same thing today.

43:33.530 --> 43:35.324
Funny guy.

43:35.324 --> 43:37.659
- Hey, you like American candy?
- Who doesn't?

43:37.659 --> 43:39.328
Yeah. Come on. It's got that bad sugar.

43:39.328 --> 43:43.207
- Yeah. High-fructose corn syrup.
- That's too many words. I say "bad sugar."

44:10.025 --> 44:13.779
At the beginning, Rupert bought me
so many tulips for so long,

44:13.779 --> 44:16.365
- his florist was able to buy a castle.
- What?

44:16.365 --> 44:19.326
I mean, it was in Scunthorpe, but still.
A castle.

44:20.869 --> 44:23.247
Well, I'm taking Jack out tonight.

44:23.247 --> 44:25.749
And if she tries to pay,
then I will give her--

44:25.749 --> 44:27.125
You'll give her what?

44:27.793 --> 44:28.877
Just the tip?

44:32.089 --> 44:34.007
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Leslie.

44:34.007 --> 44:35.926
May I present...

44:35.926 --> 44:37.553
Mr. Obisanya.

44:38.095 --> 44:40.889
Rebecca Welton.
Lovely to finally meet you.

44:40.889 --> 44:43.684
Likewise.
Samuel has told me so much about you.

44:44.810 --> 44:45.727
Has he?

44:45.727 --> 44:48.438
Yes. He has.

44:48.438 --> 44:49.857
Cool.

44:56.947 --> 44:58.991
Oh, yeah! Come on, you Greyhounds!

44:58.991 --> 45:00.367
Let's go Richmond!

45:00.951 --> 45:02.494
I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi.

45:02.995 --> 45:05.497
Hey. Let's go, Greyhounds.

45:06.290 --> 45:07.291
Come on.

45:09.835 --> 45:12.838
- Bumber! Bumber! Shot!
- Push, man!

45:12.838 --> 45:14.631
Bumber! No.

45:15.591 --> 45:17.885
Richmond have been mired
in a run of poor form,

45:17.885 --> 45:23.390
and you have to applaud Ted Lasso's
efforts to try something new. But this--

45:23.390 --> 45:25.100
What's the word I'm looking for, Chris?

45:25.851 --> 45:28.854
"Sucks," Arlo. The word is "sucks."

45:28.854 --> 45:31.231
<i>It's like they've never
played the sport before.</i>

45:32.232 --> 45:34.318
<i>Good grief,
they're tackling themselves now.</i>

45:35.402 --> 45:37.529
<i>With Richmond literally running
into each other,</i>

45:37.529 --> 45:39.156
<i>the Gunners mount a counterattack.</i>

45:39.156 --> 45:42.701
<i>Here's a through ball to Parslow.
Parslow over to Hamilton...</i>

45:42.701 --> 45:43.911
<i>And he's there!</i>

45:44.494 --> 45:47.748
<i>Hamilton has his hat trick,
and Arsenal leads 3-nil.</i>

45:47.748 --> 45:48.832
Fuck!

45:56.298 --> 45:57.299
Okay.

45:58.425 --> 45:59.510
It's all right.

46:05.432 --> 46:07.893
It's over.
We're gonna get relegated again,

46:07.893 --> 46:10.938
and I'm gonna have to go back
to filling the sausages with cardboard.

46:10.938 --> 46:11.939
Patience, Mae.

46:11.939 --> 46:13.774
Just need to give it some time.

46:13.774 --> 46:16.985
Ask yourself,
what does this situation need?

46:17.986 --> 46:20.364
<i>And at the half,
Arsenal have a three-goal lead,</i>

46:20.364 --> 46:23.450
<i>and Richmond have plenty to talk about.</i>

46:23.450 --> 46:26.662
<i>Yeah, with fun conversation starters
like, "Why are we so bad?"</i>

46:26.662 --> 46:28.247
<i>or "Should we just go home?"</i>

46:31.166 --> 46:34.378
Jamie, you keep floating back, mate.

46:34.378 --> 46:35.671
You gotta stay up front.

46:35.671 --> 46:37.256
We need you to stretch the defense.

46:37.256 --> 46:38.924
We need you to score a fucking goal.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.927
But how can we
when we can't see anyone out there.

46:41.927 --> 46:44.721
There's no shame
in going back to the good old 4-4-2.

46:44.721 --> 46:46.515
Until we've had more time
to properly train.

46:46.515 --> 46:48.016
Make you look like a prick.

46:49.184 --> 46:51.436
For fuck's sake.
What's the matter with you anyway?

46:53.605 --> 46:55.232
Hey, fellas. Listen up here.

46:56.441 --> 46:59.528
Well, I remember back in the early days
of my coaching career,

47:00.320 --> 47:03.365
feeling compelled
to express my individuality.

47:03.991 --> 47:07.786
Since I was a straight fella
in Middle America working in sports

47:07.786 --> 47:10.706
and I was scared of tattoo needles,

47:10.706 --> 47:13.333
the only real option for me to do so
was through my facial hair.

47:14.209 --> 47:16.503
And obviously I couldn't grow a beard.

47:16.503 --> 47:19.339
Otherwise, Coach and I here would,
look like a ZZ Top cover band.

47:19.923 --> 47:22.259
- Would've been called "Sharp Dressed Men."
- That's nice.

47:22.259 --> 47:24.052
God,
I hate what you've fucking done to me.

47:24.052 --> 47:27.806
Luckily, around that time there was
this quartet of stand-up comedians

47:27.806 --> 47:30.058
known as the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

47:30.058 --> 47:34.479
And along with their observational humor,
fun banter and numerous catchphrases,

47:34.479 --> 47:37.399
they also possessed
the four most common types of facial hair.

47:38.358 --> 47:40.402
Now, Ron White, who was my favorite,
he was clean-shaven.

47:40.402 --> 47:41.820
That's one way to go.

47:41.820 --> 47:46.074
But then you had Larry the Cable Guy, and
he had himself a big old, bushy goatee.

47:46.074 --> 47:48.327
And Bill Engvall,
he also had a goatee actually.

47:48.327 --> 47:51.038
But it was, you know,
smaller and more manicured.

47:51.038 --> 47:52.456
Not touching the sides here.

47:52.456 --> 47:54.541
- Also known as a Vandyke.
- Thank you, Coach.

47:55.250 --> 47:58.128
And then you had Jeff Foxworthy of course,
who had a mustache.

47:58.712 --> 48:01.131
So, check it out.
I went ahead and rolled the dice

48:01.131 --> 48:04.718
and grew myself one of them big,
bushy Cable Guy goatees.

48:04.718 --> 48:06.386
And I thought I looked great.

48:06.386 --> 48:10.224
Until Coach Beard here took me aside,

48:10.224 --> 48:11.892
right as I was about
to walk down the aisle,

48:11.892 --> 48:14.311
and told me something I needed to hear.
Remember what you said to me?

48:14.311 --> 48:17.231
"Your goatee makes it look like
you ate out bigfoot's butthole."

48:17.231 --> 48:18.232
That's right.

48:18.232 --> 48:20.025
- AKA "ass-squatch."
- You're on fire.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.693
- Make it stop.
- No, no.

48:22.319 --> 48:25.447
Coach was right though.
Not a good look. Not on this face.

48:26.907 --> 48:29.993
So I shaved that puppy down right
into a Foxworthy, and I never looked back.

48:31.620 --> 48:32.746
Point is, a lot of times

48:32.746 --> 48:35.707
the right idea is just sitting behind
a couple of the wrong ones.

48:36.542 --> 48:37.668
Yeah?

48:38.961 --> 48:40.295
You got something you wanna say, Jamie?

48:41.046 --> 48:44.091
- I mean, yeah. But...
- Great. Let us have it.

48:44.091 --> 48:47.344
Well, I don't want people
to think I'm being a prick if I say it.

48:55.435 --> 48:57.354
Okay. Well, then.

48:58.647 --> 48:59.481
I ain't doing it wrong.

48:59.481 --> 49:00.649
You're doing it wrong.

49:02.442 --> 49:05.320
I mean-- No, I mean,
I think we're all doing it wrong.

49:06.405 --> 49:07.823
If we want this to work,

49:07.823 --> 49:11.994
you gotta stop going to me
and start playing through me. You get me?

49:18.292 --> 49:19.376
Look. Just look. Look.

49:19.376 --> 49:21.545
- Can I? Do you mind if I-- Right.
- Yeah, of course.

49:21.545 --> 49:24.715
So look, I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't be playing forward.

49:24.715 --> 49:26.967
I should be here, in the center.

49:32.264 --> 49:35.517
I should be here, right?
Let Dani go up front.

49:35.517 --> 49:37.227
Move Colin over there. Richard there.

49:37.227 --> 49:41.982
So, stop going to me, right?
And start going through me. All right?

49:42.941 --> 49:44.193
That's Total Football.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.571
How's that sound to y'all?

49:47.571 --> 49:49.239
That actually works.

49:50.199 --> 49:54.494
And there it is. Número cuatro. Sacrifice.

49:54.494 --> 49:56.955
Putting aside personal glory
on behalf of the team.

49:58.665 --> 50:00.083
I like that. But that ain't number four.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.711
- Let's bring it in! Come on.
- Let's go for "four" on three.

50:02.711 --> 50:04.671
- One, two, three--
- Four!

50:05.339 --> 50:07.508
<i>The Greyhounds still 3-nil down,
in this second half.</i>

50:07.508 --> 50:09.760
<i>They need something,
and they need it soon.</i>

50:09.760 --> 50:14.848
<i>Arsenal's cross, easy for Van Damme.
And Van Damme out to Jan Maas.</i>

50:14.848 --> 50:16.350
Here we go.

50:16.350 --> 50:19.144
<i>Here's Dixon. Infield to Tartt.</i>

50:19.144 --> 50:21.730
<i>Tartt to Obisanya. Over to Hughes.</i>

50:21.730 --> 50:23.148
<i>Tartt again.</i>

50:23.148 --> 50:24.650
<i>To McAdoo in the midfield.</i>

50:25.234 --> 50:26.610
<i>Over to Rojas.</i>

50:26.610 --> 50:28.695
<i>Rojas drops it back to Tartt.</i>

50:28.695 --> 50:30.906
<i>Who sends a long ball down to Bumbercatch.</i>

50:31.740 --> 50:33.367
<i>Bumbercatch to Goodman.</i>

50:33.367 --> 50:34.576
- Goodman over to Tartt...
- Yeah.

50:34.576 --> 50:35.911
<i>...in the box.</i>

50:35.911 --> 50:37.579
<i>Old Tartt with the back heel.</i>

50:37.579 --> 50:39.790
<i>And Montlaur is there to hammer it in!</i>

50:42.000 --> 50:44.878
That was bloody gorgeous!

50:44.878 --> 50:51.343
<i>A majestic, sweeping symphony of a goal
with Tartt in the role of conductor.</i>

50:52.219 --> 50:54.930
Hey! All right!

50:55.430 --> 50:58.475
- That's it right there.
- There we go. There we go!

51:03.146 --> 51:05.065
<i>Arsenal prevails 3-1.</i>

51:05.065 --> 51:10.028
<i>But for the first time in weeks,
the Greyhounds are showing signs of life.</i>

51:14.700 --> 51:15.701
Ted.

51:17.077 --> 51:18.537
It's going to work.

51:18.537 --> 51:20.706
- Great. What is?
- Total football.

51:20.706 --> 51:21.999
- Okay. Why?
- And I'll tell you why.

51:21.999 --> 51:23.125
The Lasso way.

51:23.792 --> 51:25.752
- You haven't switched tactics in a week.
- I haven't?

51:25.752 --> 51:28.213
- No. You've done this over three seasons.
- I have?

51:28.213 --> 51:31.925
Yes. By slowly but surely building
a club-wide culture of trust and support

51:31.925 --> 51:33.594
through thousands
of imperceptible moments,

51:33.594 --> 51:36.221
all leading to
their inevitable conclusion.

51:36.221 --> 51:38.098
- Total Football.
- Well, how about that.

51:39.558 --> 51:40.726
It's gonna work.

51:42.519 --> 51:44.354
Doesn't even matter what number four is.

51:48.775 --> 51:50.652
What a fucking dork.

51:50.652 --> 51:53.739
Yeah. But he's our dork.

52:22.643 --> 52:24.686
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:24.686 --> 52:25.854
- Hi.
- All right to sit?

52:25.854 --> 52:27.689
Of course. Yeah, take a seat.

52:27.689 --> 52:28.774
Thank you.

52:28.774 --> 52:31.610
Wow. You look great. Thank you for coming.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.862
- Thank you for coming?
- You know...

52:33.862 --> 52:35.447
Did you think I was gonna stand you up?

52:35.447 --> 52:37.991
No. Do you want a drink? Sorry, I ordered.

52:37.991 --> 52:39.660
- No, that's fine.
- Just got nervous.

52:40.160 --> 52:43.330
Please. Here we are, and there you go.

52:43.330 --> 52:47.501
Best table in the house. As requested.

52:50.712 --> 52:51.922
You little love bomber.

52:58.679 --> 53:01.014
I know it's not the outcome you wanted,

53:01.014 --> 53:03.976
but I'm very proud of the way
you and your team played today.

53:04.852 --> 53:05.894
Thanks, Dad.

53:06.687 --> 53:07.896
And I met Rebecca.

53:07.896 --> 53:11.775
- Oh, no. Did you make things weird?
- Yes.

53:19.950 --> 53:22.953
- Do you want to go and see the restaurant?
- I would love to.

53:29.251 --> 53:31.003
I don't know, Dad, I wish--

53:31.003 --> 53:33.380
I wish you could've seen it
when it was done up. It was perfect.

53:33.380 --> 53:34.548
This looks nice.

53:34.548 --> 53:37.259
- Daddy, it's not the same.
- It isn't so bad.

53:47.853 --> 53:49.146
Yo, look who's here.

53:50.355 --> 53:51.481
Hey.

53:52.107 --> 53:53.775
The surprise is ruined.

53:53.775 --> 53:55.152
What are you guys doing here?

53:55.152 --> 53:59.323
Well, we all just asked ourselves,
"What does this situation need?"

53:59.323 --> 54:01.283
And we thought your situation needed us.

54:01.867 --> 54:04.161
Yeah, got my cousin to fix
your window this morning.

54:04.161 --> 54:06.455
Didn't get a discount though,
'cause he's a prick.

54:07.831 --> 54:10.459
And I brought some cases of wine
from my personal cellar.

54:10.459 --> 54:12.961
Not the best stuff obviously,
but still very, very good.

54:13.462 --> 54:15.506
And Bumbercatch
is trying to fix your sign.

54:15.506 --> 54:18.509
Neon signs are just a bunch
of illuminated, gas-discharge tubes.

54:18.509 --> 54:20.802
So I thought I'd give it a shot. Screwdriver.

54:22.137 --> 54:25.599
Guys, this is incredible. Honestly.

54:25.599 --> 54:27.142
Thank you all so very much.

54:27.142 --> 54:28.810
- We got you, man.
- No worries.

54:29.478 --> 54:31.271
- Great work, Van Damme.
- Simi.

54:31.271 --> 54:32.356
Sam.

54:33.982 --> 54:35.108
Oh, my God.

54:35.734 --> 54:38.862
- Was this your idea?
- No, they called me.

54:38.862 --> 54:40.447
- It's amazing, right?
- It's--

54:41.532 --> 54:42.991
There's somebody I'd love for you to meet.

54:42.991 --> 54:45.536
- Okay.
- Simi, this is my father.

54:45.536 --> 54:49.957
So very nice to meet you, Simi.
Sam has told me so much about you.

54:50.541 --> 54:52.459
- Has he?
- Yes, he has.

54:54.169 --> 54:56.213
Well,
it's lovely to meet you too, Mr. Obisanya.

54:56.213 --> 55:00.384
No. My father
was Mr. Obisanya. Call me Ola.

55:12.521 --> 55:14.648
Don't worry.
I'll order the new mirrors on Monday.

55:17.484 --> 55:19.611
No. No. Let's keep them.

55:20.237 --> 55:23.615
I think they serve as a good reminder that
everything doesn't have to be perfect.

55:23.615 --> 55:27.077
And if the food is good,
who cares about the mirrors?

55:27.077 --> 55:28.453
Exactly.

55:28.453 --> 55:30.163
Speaking of, who's hungry?

55:30.163 --> 55:31.081
Yes!

55:31.081 --> 55:33.417
Good. So I will cook you all dinner.

55:34.084 --> 55:36.086
Sam, Simi, follow me.

55:37.087 --> 55:38.088
Yes, Chef!

56:01.612 --> 56:02.863
Apps are up.

56:06.617 --> 56:08.202
Come on, let me help you, child.
