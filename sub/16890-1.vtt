the Indiana Mole Women.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.423
Ladies, welcome.

02:11.507 --> 02:12.800
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Bryant.

02:12.884 --> 02:14.385
For years, you were told

02:14.468 --> 02:16.178
by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne

02:16.261 --> 02:18.305
that the world had ended.

02:18.389 --> 02:19.891
Yes, Reverend Richard told us

02:19.974 --> 02:21.726
that there had been
a nuclear apocalypse

02:21.809 --> 02:23.227
and that the Earth was scorched

02:23.310 --> 02:25.855
and there were lakes of fire and stuff.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.314
Cyndee, you were
the first young woman

02:27.398 --> 02:29.233
forced into this cult.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.651
Yes, I had waited
on Reverend Richard

02:30.735 --> 02:31.986
a bunch of times

02:32.070 --> 02:33.946
at a York Steak House
I worked at,

02:34.030 --> 02:36.448
and one night he invited me
out to his car

02:36.532 --> 02:38.158
to see some baby rabbits.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.244
And I didn't want to be rude, so...

02:40.327 --> 02:41.829
here we are.

02:41.913 --> 02:44.540
I'm always amazed
at what women will do

02:44.623 --> 02:45.917
because they're afraid
of being rude.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.085
- Yeah.
- Gretchen.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.920
You joined this cult willingly.

02:49.003 --> 02:53.007
Yes, the Reverend had bought
some of my hair on Craigslist,

02:53.091 --> 02:55.051
and we started emailing,

02:55.134 --> 02:58.763

some real good ideas.

You were lured
into the reverend's house.

You thought this was a job.
