I love our new loft!

00:09.843 --> 00:12.429
I love saying
"I'll be upstairs."

00:12.512 --> 00:15.640
I love square footage,

00:21.354 --> 00:22.939
I'm setting up my office.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.608
Val, we have be working like
dogs ever since we moved in

00:25.692 --> 00:27.026

all this icky confusion.

You want icky confusion,
I have a math final

from two years ago

It's a good thing
you're pretty.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.801
Come on, Val, it's Saturday,
take the weekend off.

Oh, Holly, when you're starting
your own business

00:54.220 --> 00:55.680
there is no such thing
as a weekend.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.599
But don't worry about me.
You go have fun.

00:57.682 --> 01:01.311
Alright.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.688
You know, I'd have a lot
more fun if I knew

01:03.772 --> 01:05.857
you weren't gonna be here
all alone working all day.

not tell them who it was!

02:03.790 --> 02:05.583
Yeah, at least
give us a hint.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.877
Okay, um, she has three names.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.045
Sarah Jessica Parker?

02:10.128 --> 02:11.381
- No.
- Sarah Michelle Gellar?

02:11.464 --> 02:15.218
Nope. No three-name Sarahs
were involved.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.303
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
Yeah!

02:19.973 --> 02:22.809
I don't think
that's three names, or legal.

At least not for another
248 days.

getting a little

uncomfortable with this
whole conversation.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.452
No, just your part
with Beyonce.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.706
I think she's totally into

Jennifer Love Hewitt.

isn't the best conversation

be a joke?

you tell me?

to come here

You want to go look at her?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.411
No, I don't need to see her.

- Why not?
- I already have her pictured.

with a glass eye

07:38.124 --> 07:39.917

I go see her
and report back to you.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.174
No. What if she's
prettier than me?

07:46.257 --> 07:47.466
- I'll lie.
- No, don't lie.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.801
I have to know the truth.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.553
Okay, fine, but if
she's prettier than you

07:50.636 --> 07:51.596
then I will tell you.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.805
You would do that to me?

are you?

take no for an answer.

Are you supposed
to take everything off?

It's totally up to you.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.883
You know, most people
take everything off.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.885
I'll probably leave
like a little something on.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.557
My lipstick.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.820
Oh, my God, that's her!

10:12.903 --> 10:13.946
'How do you know?'

10:14.030 --> 10:15.823
The way she acts all cocky.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.743
And her name tag says "Shannon."

10:18.826 --> 10:21.329
You're looking at the girl
who soiled your boyfriend.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.498
She doesn't have a hump.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.126
'Unfortunately, she's got
two nice ones in the front.'

10:28.502 --> 10:30.046
Okay, okay, we have
seen her. Now let's go.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.714
No, I've got to go talk to her.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.049
Why?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.426
I've got to find
something wrong with her.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.221
Hi. Can I help you?

10:39.305 --> 10:42.933
No, I was just noticing
what nice skin you have

10:43.017 --> 10:44.060
and such pretty eyes.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.728
Might they be glass?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.064
What?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.024
What she means is they're
really bright and shiny.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.902
What kind of eyeliner
do you use?

10:52.985 --> 10:53.986
Oh.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.738
Hey, you look
kind of familiar.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.531
Uh, do you go
to Stuyvesant?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.575
- Hunter.
- Huh. Oh, wait.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.243
Did we go to camp together?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.579
I don't know.
Did you go to Ticonderoga?

11:03.662 --> 11:05.081
Yes!

11:05.164 --> 11:07.792
I thought I knew you
from somewhere. Wow!

11:07.875 --> 11:10.836
- Hi. Holly. And this is Tina.
- Hi.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.506
You know, I'm sorry.
I don't know if I remember you.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.257
Huh. Oh..

11:15.341 --> 11:16.675
I was a lot heavier back then.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
I was hitting the s'mores
pretty hard

11:18.803 --> 11:19.970
around the campfire.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.100
Yeah, yeah, she went
to fat camp last summer.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.476
Yeah, that's where I met Tina.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.939
So, this has been
the weirdest week.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.274
First we ran into
Henry Gibson on the subway

11:32.358 --> 11:34.110
now we see you here.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.737
- Henry Gibson?
- Yeah, you remember him, right?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.072
He's kinda tall, cute.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.324
Yeah. Yeah, I remember Henry.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.077
So, um, do you want
to look at something?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.745
Hey..

11:44.829 --> 11:47.123
Weren't you and Henry kinda..

11:47.206 --> 11:50.334
You know, I really don't wanna
talk about Henry right now.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.294
Why not?

11:52.378 --> 11:53.754
Because whenever
I think about him

11:53.838 --> 11:56.090
it makes me want to vomit.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.467
Henry Gibson?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.802
Are you sure you've got
the right one?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.846
He seems like such a nice guy.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.681
Well, yeah, sure.
See, that's his thing.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.932
That's how he comes off.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.976
He comes off all nice
and sweet and innocent

12:07.059 --> 12:08.144
and then he gets what he wants

12:08.227 --> 12:10.688
and he totally blows you off.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.106
Henry Gibson?

12:13.357 --> 12:14.733
You're not thinking
about going there, are you?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.026
Because I'll tell you
the same thing

12:16.110 --> 12:17.486
that I tell any girl
who's even thinking

12:17.570 --> 12:19.155
about getting involved
with that punk.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.739
Stay away.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.578
This may be my own
personal sickness

12:25.661 --> 12:28.372
but I have never
found him more attractive.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.836

Ooh. That must be lunch.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.685
You ordered us lunch?

12:49.768 --> 12:52.188
Yes, I did. Something
special for your birthday.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.107
Oh, please let it be Carlos
with a side of Renaldo.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.654
- Aloha.
- Hey, here's your food.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.281
Oh, great.
Can you just set it over there?

13:02.364 --> 13:03.866
Thanks.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.201
Oh. Did you remember the cake?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.827
- It's in the box.
- Oh good.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.537
And, you know, cake's free
if today's your actual birthday.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.789
- Oh, great.
- But I'll need to see some ID.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.542
Okay. No problem. Let's see..

13:13.626 --> 13:15.961
Where does she keep..
Ah, here we go.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.381
- Um, today's not March 3rd.
- What?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.592
It says her birthday's
March 3rd.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.386
Unbelievable!

13:26.180 --> 13:28.307
You free cake people
are the worst.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.976
That'll be $45.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.104
You got change for a hundred?

13:34.188 --> 13:37.066
- No.
- Good. Keep it.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.236
Oh, my God. All this for me?

13:40.319 --> 13:43.072
Yep, 'cause it's your birthday.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.907
Aw, you got me a cake.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.244
Yes, I did.
I got you a birthday cake.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.787
'Cause that is what you eat

13:49.870 --> 13:52.248
on your birthday.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.708
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's have some now.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.502
Oh, yay!

13:56.585 --> 13:58.754
Here you go! Make a wish.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.423
Okay, I know just what
I'm going to wish for.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.551
You know, if you make a wish

14:03.634 --> 14:05.844
and it's not your birthday

14:06.804 --> 14:08.847
you burn in hell.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.434
I wish it was my birthday.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.698
So do you want to talk
about what's been bugging you?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.366
Nothing's bugging me.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.953
Come on, Gary, let's go
order at the counter.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.204
No, I want to stay
and find out

14:32.288 --> 14:34.498
what's bugging Holly.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.459
If you don't come with me I'm
going to take my female products

14:37.543 --> 14:39.503
out of my bag.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.754
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.132
Okay. Okay. Don't.
Stop. Let's go.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.555
You haven't looked me
in the eye all day.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.725
I get one-word answers.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.727
I think I know
when something's bugging you.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.645
You know me pretty well?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.355
I think I do.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.274
I think Gary's little
announcement this morning

15:00.357 --> 15:02.901
bothers you a lot more
than you want to admit.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.862
I saw her today.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.656
- Who?
- Shannon.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.241
- What?
- Yeah.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.492
I found out that
she works at Bloomie's

15:10.576 --> 15:12.411
and that's where
Tina and I went.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.788
Are you serious?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.832
I can deal with the fact
that you didn't wanna tell me

15:16.915 --> 15:18.208
about her but
did you really just

15:18.292 --> 15:19.501
use her like that
and then blow her off?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.878
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.006
You, uh, you talked to her?
About me?

15:24.089 --> 15:26.550
- How-how could you do that?
- It's not true, is it, Henry?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.427
Just tell me that she's lying,
and I'll believe you.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.678
If you wanted the whole story

15:29.762 --> 15:31.180
you should have
come to me first!

15:31.263 --> 15:33.682
Oh, my God.
You're avoiding the question.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.101
Uh, no. What I'm avoiding
is telling you

15:36.185 --> 15:38.020
exactly how angry I am
right now.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.064
You're angry? Well, you know,
I'm a little freaked.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.066
Can you imagine how I felt
when she said--

15:42.149 --> 15:43.442
I don't care what she said!

15:43.525 --> 15:44.943
You never
should have gone there.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.529
I would never go digging
around your private life.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.614
That's 'cause I'm honest
with you and

15:48.697 --> 15:49.698
I tell you everything.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.991
Honest with me? Um..

15:51.075 --> 15:52.201
I think the conversation
this morning

15:52.284 --> 15:53.494
went a little like this..

15:53.577 --> 15:55.454
"It's okay. I'm cool."

15:55.537 --> 15:56.747
"You swear?"

15:56.830 --> 15:58.332
"I swear."

15:59.541 --> 16:00.876
If you were totally
cool about it

16:00.959 --> 16:02.211
you wouldn't have been lurking

16:02.294 --> 16:03.504
around a department store

16:03.587 --> 16:05.589
stalking my old girlfriends.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.590
"Girlfriends?"

16:06.674 --> 16:07.716
What, did you do the entire

16:07.800 --> 16:09.718
lingerie department, too?

16:10.969 --> 16:12.137
Maybe.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.894
I hope he had a good time
with that camp girl

16:18.977 --> 16:21.313
'cause that's going to have
to last him a long time.

No. Thank you.
You can go.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.760
Okay, can I ask you something?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.178
Did you have fun today?

16:53.262 --> 16:54.430
You made me waste--

16:54.513 --> 16:57.349
Ah, ah! Did you have fun today?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.893
- You lied to me--
- Buh, buh, buh!

16:59.977 --> 17:03.355
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.733
- Did you relax?
- Yes.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.901
Okay, well, then did it
ever occur to you

17:07.984 --> 17:10.028
that I was doing something
nice for you today?

17:10.112 --> 17:11.446
No.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.781
Okay, look..

17:13.866 --> 17:15.451
...sometimes people look at me

17:15.534 --> 17:16.660
because I'm so pretty

17:16.743 --> 17:20.622
and they think I'm superficial.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.374
But there is depth there.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.667
And the truth is,
I'm worried about you.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.881
Why you ask..

17:28.964 --> 17:31.467
'Cause I don't want
anything to happen to you.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.470
Look, I spent my whole life
watching my father

17:34.553 --> 17:36.805
work every Saturday
and most Sundays.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.140
And you know what that got him?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.142
A heart attack.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.769
Is this a real story?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.313
Oh, my God,
I wouldn't lie about that.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.690
Okay, sorry. Is he okay?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.941
Is your father still..

wanted a son? Yes.

Look, the point is..

17:55.741 --> 17:57.242
...it was really scary.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.870
And you are, like,
so tightly wound.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.831
And I don't want anything
to happen to you.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.835
You should think about that
every time you want to fire me.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.046
'Cause without me,
oh, you're dead.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.675

- Oh.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.146
- Thank you.
- You know what?

18:26.230 --> 18:27.773
I think we should celebrate
your fake birthday

18:27.856 --> 18:29.024
at least once a month

18:29.107 --> 18:31.527
and always invite
hot Brazilian men.

Hello, Holly.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.673
Hello, Henry.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.384
You're looking well.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.718
So, you called.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.929
Was there something
you care to discuss?

19:00.639 --> 19:03.350
Would you like to hear
my side of the story?

19:03.433 --> 19:04.726
Sure.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.478
Shannon wasn't lying.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.605
Oh, my God, Henry,
how could you do that?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.607
Well, would you just
let me finish?

19:10.691 --> 19:11.859
Yes.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.407
After the incident

19:18.490 --> 19:20.075
I didn't speak to her.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.995
The whole thing was a nightmare.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.830
She was bossy and cold

19:24.913 --> 19:28.166
and she accused me
of being in over my head.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.252
I mean, it was my first time.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.461
And not a lot of women
know this

19:31.545 --> 19:33.088
but it's a little nerve-racking

19:33.172 --> 19:34.631
for the guy, too.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.217
And by the way, I think
I did a pretty damn good job

19:37.301 --> 19:39.636
considering it was dark
and we were both in a canoe.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.931
So you didn't use her.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.100
No. After the way

19:45.183 --> 19:47.144
she treated me like that

19:47.227 --> 19:49.479
I just didn't want
anything to do with her.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.817
And that's the whole story.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.196
So we're okay?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.116
Pretty much.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.785
Come on, what else?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.579
I don't know.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
What?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.629
I just sort of feel like
we don't have that thing

20:13.712 --> 20:15.631
in common anymore.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.634
I mean, what I loved
was that when we were ready

20:18.717 --> 20:22.471
we were going to experience
our first time together.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.808
Well, my first time
was in a canoe

20:26.892 --> 20:29.770
so, technically, on land
I'm still a virgin.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.658
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.159
Hey. Watching birds.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.661
Oh, that's sweet.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.372
Yeah. They keep pooping
over there in the same spot.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.708
But I don't mind.
You know why?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.543
- Why?
- Because I'm chillin'.

20:55.921 --> 20:56.922
How was the park?

20:57.005 --> 20:58.840
It was fun.
I got a little color.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.968
Found out
Henry's not a virgin.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.928
- Henry?
- I know.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.763
Henry Gibson?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.473
I know.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.933
Wait a second.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.353
He's not, not a,
because you're not..

21:11.436 --> 21:12.688
No, no, don't worry.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.107
I'm the last virgin in my group.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.525
Possibly on the planet.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.403
That's what I like to hear.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.113
You keep up the good work.
