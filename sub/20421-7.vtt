00:03.240 --> 00:06.740
<i>This world has one type of currency: gold.</i>

00:07.820 --> 00:11.990
<i>The standard cost for the items in 
a single meal is around five gold.</i>

00:12.820 --> 00:15.560
<i>A night at a cheap inn is ten gold.</i>

00:16.400 --> 00:20.230
<i>Thirty-five gold a day will suffice 
to supply life's basic needs.</i>

00:21.530 --> 00:24.720
<i>You can earn that much by defeating six goblins.</i>

00:25.880 --> 00:27.340
<i>And adventurers</i>

00:27.340 --> 00:31.930
<i>can put money and items in 
the guild building's bank,</i>

00:31.930 --> 00:34.280
<i>to keep them from being stolen by others.</i>

00:34.930 --> 00:39.530
<i>Of course, any one person's 
account has limited space.</i>

00:40.760 --> 00:42.180
I need money.

00:42.980 --> 00:44.140
For now,

00:44.690 --> 00:46.150
five million gold.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.530
That's insane!

00:47.530 --> 00:49.320
Our treasury only has sixty thousand.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.570
Even if we included all our members' belongings...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.530
What would you use all that money for?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.990
<b>Imperial Garden Forest
Japan Server
League of Freedom Cities, Eastal/ Shinjuku 
Field/ Monsters Present 
Entry Restrictions/ None 
Events/ None Currently</b>

02:31.380 --> 02:32.670
<b>Imperial Forest Boar, Lv. 18 
Rank/ Normal</b>

02:33.020 --> 02:35.890
It's pretty tough to catch them alive...

02:36.240 --> 02:39.970
If you kill them, they just become ingredient items.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.400
It's impossible...

02:41.400 --> 02:46.180
That huge boar becomes a mere 
two kilograms of meat!

02:46.180 --> 02:50.940
But with a good cook, if you catch them 
alive, you can use the entire thing.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.770
Okay, let's do this!

02:55.620 --> 02:58.280
Our quota for today is sixty!

02:58.280 --> 02:58.950
Okay!

02:59.620 --> 03:01.050
If it's for Marie,

03:01.440 --> 03:03.450
I'll catch as many as you need!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.700
That isn't quite right.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.420
Something easier to move in would be nice.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.530
Let's see what clothes we have in the bank.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.590
Okay!

03:19.350 --> 03:20.590
Taste this!

03:21.150 --> 03:22.300
Let me see...

03:23.280 --> 03:25.510
It needs a little salt.

03:25.930 --> 03:29.390
And add coriander as a secret ingredient.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.840
Okay, thank you!

03:31.840 --> 03:34.270
Nyanta is so wonderful...

03:34.460 --> 03:40.280
<b>Crescent Moon</b>

03:36.390 --> 03:37.800
Crescent Moon.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.790
I haven't left the room for three days...

03:49.330 --> 03:50.910
I can't take this anymore...

03:51.810 --> 03:54.610
We need these registers for our plan.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.880
Look through and approve them.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.620
Wait, it's impossible... That's impossible!

03:59.620 --> 04:01.070
It is, indeed.

04:01.070 --> 04:03.900
You know paperwork isn't really my thing.

04:03.900 --> 04:07.510
Approving budgets is your job, guild master.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.230
Shut up, shut up...

04:09.230 --> 04:10.590
Stupid Umeko!

04:10.590 --> 04:12.020
Don't use my real name!

04:12.170 --> 04:15.030
Umeko! Umeko! Umeko!

04:16.570 --> 04:18.260
I've brought more, Marie.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.530
Shiro, you're a demon...

04:20.890 --> 04:24.180
Shiroe, I've compiled a list of 
everything you requested.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.850
That was fast!

04:27.060 --> 04:28.540
And the numbers are accurate.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.580
Our treasurer is amazing.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.250
The devil himself would run

04:33.250 --> 04:35.040
if he saw her coming with a stack of budgets.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.860
No, there are limits to my abilities.

04:39.210 --> 04:43.800
What amazes me is the 
mercilessness of Shiroe's plans.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.430
He should just call himself Mr. Super Villain.

04:47.700 --> 04:52.930
Compared to Marie's spaciness, 
my villainy is nothing.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.690
That's true!

04:55.560 --> 04:57.270
I give up...

04:59.230 --> 05:01.240
Anyway, there's so much work,

05:01.240 --> 05:05.610
having Akatsuki for a full day is 
the only way I can keep going.

05:05.610 --> 05:09.910
She's on a separate mission right now, 
but she could probably spare a bit of time.

05:11.580 --> 05:12.410
Oh, my!

05:15.040 --> 05:18.580
Is catching a cold even possible in this world?

05:18.580 --> 05:23.020
Here's the money for this week. 
This is a great way to earn money.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.020
Thank you.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.820
Tell Isaac hello for me.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.930
Hey, I heard you started dealing 
in leather-working, too.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.950
We're open twenty-four hours a day, 
and can repair things quickly.

05:35.470 --> 05:38.590
Well, now... This is quite the haul.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.090
Now it's up to you, chief!

05:41.090 --> 05:44.440
Naotsugu! Thank you!

05:46.140 --> 05:47.620
Rub, rub, rub, rub!

05:46.650 --> 05:47.620
Hey...

05:47.620 --> 05:48.820
Don't cling to me!

05:49.610 --> 05:51.680
Marie, behave yourself.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.120
Shouryuu and Hien, thank you both, also!

05:55.120 --> 05:56.830
He was all fired up.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.710
No, you're just good at slacking off!

05:59.710 --> 06:01.460
Who's slacking off?

06:01.460 --> 06:03.510
You loyal little puppy!

06:03.510 --> 06:05.260
Shut up, you flippant fox!

06:06.150 --> 06:08.220
But there still isn't enough.

06:08.930 --> 06:09.680
I'm on it!

06:12.910 --> 06:16.060
I don't know why, but he's really into this...

06:16.720 --> 06:18.800
I can always count on you, Shouryuu!

06:22.330 --> 06:24.190
No more!

06:24.410 --> 06:26.720
This is all the paperwork.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.620
Then, I'll return to my own job.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.530
Now I'm scared of glasses.

06:32.950 --> 06:35.700
The glasses all frighten me!

06:36.140 --> 06:37.710
Ta-da!

06:38.110 --> 06:39.990
Oh, it's wonderful!

06:39.990 --> 06:41.610
Cute and distinctive.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.570
It's amazing how nice handmade stuff looks.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.210
Now we're almost done.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.680
<i>It's finally time...</i>

06:49.930 --> 06:52.100
What do you think, Henrietta?

06:53.960 --> 06:56.680
In the old world, weren't you an accountant,

06:56.680 --> 06:59.060
with a master's in business administration?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.440
I think it can work.

07:02.870 --> 07:06.480
Basically, we just need to get 
the money, any way we can.

07:07.150 --> 07:11.490
We don't have to worry about where 
it came from or whose it was.

07:11.950 --> 07:15.100
At the moment, this world has no rules.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.500
There's no point in restricting 
ourselves by making new ones.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.000
<i>This world has no rules...</i>

07:23.620 --> 07:28.010
<i>In other words, we can make up our own...</i>

07:28.790 --> 07:31.570
<i>We need a new rule to make money.</i>

07:32.140 --> 07:36.480
<i>A way to make people bring us money, 
and be happy doing so...</i>

07:42.410 --> 07:43.570
We can do it.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.940
Five million gold.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.400
We can get the money.

07:53.990 --> 07:57.510
Now it's time for the plan's first stage.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.430
Marie, I brought you a snack.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.760
Chief Nyanta made this sandwich himseâ€”

08:07.400 --> 08:09.100
I can't go on!

08:09.100 --> 08:11.170
Stupid Umeko, I hate you!

08:11.170 --> 08:12.330
Hey, come on...

08:12.620 --> 08:14.840
I can't take this room anymore.

08:15.110 --> 08:16.430
I want a bath.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.550
I want to go outside!

08:17.090 --> 08:19.550
Okay... Okay, Marie...

08:19.550 --> 08:20.610
Easy there.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.590
This is great!

08:25.590 --> 08:26.400
Hey...

08:26.400 --> 08:27.510
Hmm?

08:27.510 --> 08:30.190
Thanks for going along with Shiro's plan.

08:30.570 --> 08:31.360
Eh?

08:31.680 --> 08:36.280
I think it made him happy that you agreed.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.540
Thank you.

08:40.860 --> 08:42.990
You're a good boy, Naotsugu...

08:45.440 --> 08:47.190
Good boy, good boy.

08:47.190 --> 08:50.050
I'm glad you're with Shiro.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.260
Keep being his friend.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.550
Y-Yeah...

08:55.650 --> 08:58.050
So, tomorrow's the day.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.390
Yeah, tomorrow.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.560
Hey...

09:06.760 --> 09:09.800
Before we head into the field, 
let's grab something to eat.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.450
Does it matter what?

09:11.450 --> 09:13.670
Everything tastes the same, anyway.

09:14.060 --> 09:16.070
Don't say that.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.000
Anyway, this place sure is deserted...

09:19.000 --> 09:20.600
Of course it is.

09:20.910 --> 09:25.950
Well, if it all tastes the same, 
the cheapest food is as good as any...

09:25.950 --> 09:27.800
I smell something good.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.090
No way.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.590
Hello, residents of Akihabara!

09:33.060 --> 09:36.340
For those of you who miss real food, 
we have good news.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.850
Now you can bring genuine 
flavor back to your table!

09:40.190 --> 09:43.770
The Crescent Moon refreshment stand opens today!

09:43.770 --> 09:45.350
Please give it a try!

09:45.920 --> 09:49.120
Thank you! Thank you for your purchase!

09:49.120 --> 09:51.360
Serara, we haven't sold any yet.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.470
"Crescent Burger, fifteen gold.

09:54.470 --> 09:57.450
One crispy chicken strip, eighteen gold...

09:57.450 --> 09:59.370
Black rose tea, five gold."

09:59.930 --> 10:01.800
That's pretty pricey!

10:02.180 --> 10:04.790
What noisy, strange people.

10:05.290 --> 10:08.290
Mister, care to take a 
leap of faith and try one?

10:09.010 --> 10:11.290
You'll be amazed at how good it is.

10:11.540 --> 10:15.390
Ah, th-then... I'll take a Crescent Burger.

10:15.390 --> 10:16.430
Or she will.

10:16.430 --> 10:17.550
Me?!

10:18.610 --> 10:19.970
Thank you.

10:19.970 --> 10:21.720
One Crescent Burger coming right up.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.470
Thank you!

10:24.030 --> 10:26.000
This smell...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.980
No, even if it smells good...

10:27.980 --> 10:31.050
It either tastes like nothing or like salt.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.570
Give it a try!

10:37.160 --> 10:38.340
What is this?

10:38.340 --> 10:39.120
Huh?

10:42.230 --> 10:45.370
It tastes like a hamburger!

10:45.590 --> 10:46.990
What?!

10:46.990 --> 10:48.890
Hey, I want one, too!

10:47.590 --> 10:48.890
Me, too!

10:52.190 --> 10:55.470
It tastes like grilled meat and sauce...

10:55.470 --> 10:57.340
It's so good!

10:57.340 --> 10:59.200
We can't just stand here!

10:59.200 --> 11:00.640
Let's go tell Sou!

11:00.860 --> 11:02.040
I'll take three Crescent Burgers!

11:02.040 --> 11:03.040
Don't cut in line!

11:03.040 --> 11:04.640
Five crispy chicken strips!

11:04.640 --> 11:07.140
I'll take one of everything on the menu!

11:15.990 --> 11:19.490
<b>End of Line</b>

11:16.940 --> 11:19.870
Um... Um, this is the end of the line.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.490
Thank you for staying in line!

11:23.810 --> 11:25.590
We only have one box of burgers left!

11:25.590 --> 11:26.910
Eh? Really?

11:26.910 --> 11:29.210
Don't worry, Marie.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.210
I'm bringing more.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.400
This is where things will get tough.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.920
We'll go at full speed!

11:40.190 --> 11:41.430
This is...

11:41.930 --> 11:42.910
Delicious?

11:43.380 --> 11:44.550
Who made this?

11:45.310 --> 11:46.410
How?

11:47.870 --> 11:50.340
Have you tried the Crescent Burger?

11:50.340 --> 11:52.810
I heard it's food that actually tastes like food.

11:52.810 --> 11:55.330
Not just ingredient items? Seriously?

11:57.570 --> 11:59.260
This flavor, at this price.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.200
I wonder if we can get in on this...

12:03.330 --> 12:05.070
Trouble, boss!

12:05.070 --> 12:05.700
Look at this!

12:06.320 --> 12:08.210
You're too slow on the draw, Kayu...

12:08.560 --> 12:10.270
This is good, though.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.640
Investigate the shop.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.590
Who's running it, what they use for 
ingredients, and how they get them.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.150
Everything you can find!

12:18.970 --> 12:19.800
Right!

12:21.730 --> 12:24.510
This will change the world.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.760
Okay, that's enough for now.

12:31.380 --> 12:32.860
Let's go, kids.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.310
Right!

12:34.310 --> 12:35.520
I will gather more.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.860
You two, go on back.

12:38.310 --> 12:41.210
Don't push yourself... There's a long way to go.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.030
No.

12:43.350 --> 12:44.530
I don't want to lose.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.610
Huh? To whom?

12:46.610 --> 12:48.670
Then, let's go.

12:48.670 --> 12:49.670
Is he okay?

12:49.670 --> 12:51.040
He'll be fine...

12:51.970 --> 12:53.040
Just watch me,

12:53.840 --> 12:54.670
Marie.

12:55.130 --> 12:55.830
I...

12:58.990 --> 13:00.550
A-An area boss?

13:01.930 --> 13:03.050
You're joking.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.540
Good work, everyone.

13:07.540 --> 13:08.470
Well? Well?

13:08.470 --> 13:10.070
How much did we make?

13:10.070 --> 13:14.230
We earned 43,776 gold in sales,

13:14.230 --> 13:19.480
representing 1,159 customers who 
spent an average of 38 gold each.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.680
We sold out the crescent burgers we prepared,

13:22.240 --> 13:23.100
Cheers!

13:22.680 --> 13:26.610
as well as everything else, 
except the black rose tea.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.000
Wow!

13:28.000 --> 13:29.610
This is great!

13:29.610 --> 13:33.120
At this rate, we'll get that five 
million in no time at all!

13:33.350 --> 13:36.840
We'll never make it in time... 
Not even close, Marie.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.130
We won't?

13:38.530 --> 13:41.630
Basic math shows it would take 
one hundred, twenty days...

13:41.880 --> 13:43.770
Or four months.

13:43.770 --> 13:47.630
But today, we turned away a lot of customers...

13:47.630 --> 13:49.410
If we wanted, we could sell a lot more.

13:49.410 --> 13:52.930
Our total market size probably 
measures in the tens of thousands.

13:53.730 --> 13:57.500
In Akihabara alone, there are 
over fifteen thousand players.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.440
The problem is,

13:59.700 --> 14:02.270
no matter how high the demand,

14:02.270 --> 14:06.200
we can only serve around a 
thousand customers a day.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.860
Our guild just isn't big enough.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.060
That's it.

14:11.060 --> 14:14.620
Money isn't the point of this plan, anyway.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.090
That's right.

14:16.090 --> 14:19.210
I was just blinded by the huge 
fortune in front of me.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.410
I'll go deposit our earnings in the bank.

14:24.410 --> 14:25.310
Thanks.

14:25.310 --> 14:26.680
Hey, Shiro.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.100
If money wasn't the Crescent Burger's goal,

14:30.540 --> 14:33.150
does that mean you'll use your other plan?

14:34.520 --> 14:36.270
I'm sure it'll work.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.020
But I don't know if I can do it.

14:39.860 --> 14:42.220
Just leave it to Henrietta.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.440
Right?

14:43.850 --> 14:45.040
Yes.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.010
Leave it to me.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.700
In exchange...

14:52.080 --> 14:55.120
Where are you going?

14:55.800 --> 14:58.830
My lord has given me a secret mission!

14:58.830 --> 15:00.120
Don't try to stop me!

15:01.060 --> 15:05.090
Shiroe was kind enough to lend you to me.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.010
My lord, you sold me out again!

15:09.240 --> 15:10.470
Now, hurry...

15:11.220 --> 15:12.200
Put this on!

15:12.200 --> 15:13.010
I refuse!

15:13.560 --> 15:15.470
I am not a doll for you to dress up!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.390
You can't enter that room.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.310
What?

15:22.800 --> 15:26.490
This zone belongs to the Crescent Moon Alliance.

15:26.550 --> 15:31.320

15:26.960 --> 15:31.320

I can't use it?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.330
It's useless...

15:39.830 --> 15:43.150
I set it so that skills can't be used here.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.840
And I can also set combat 
permissions individually.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.090
Have you forgotten?

15:50.690 --> 15:51.940
Curse you...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.580
So cute!

15:54.580 --> 15:55.920
My, my...

15:55.920 --> 15:58.440
It looks wonderful on you.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.880
Ah! My exhaustion is flying away!

16:02.420 --> 16:04.510
Hey, have you seen Shouryuu?

16:05.330 --> 16:06.900
Now that you mention it, he's late.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.780
He was so excited, he hasn't 
returned from hunting...

16:11.080 --> 16:12.750
R-Really?

16:12.750 --> 16:14.330
Maybe something happened...

16:15.630 --> 16:16.650
What's going on?

16:16.650 --> 16:19.110
There's a boar stuck in the hall.

16:20.870 --> 16:21.980
Shouryuu...

16:21.980 --> 16:25.810
Marie, am I helping a little?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.250
Shouryuu!

16:29.040 --> 16:30.610
Shouryuu!

16:32.490 --> 16:33.090
Eh?

16:33.710 --> 16:36.190
He hasn't rested or slept for a long time.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.640
He's been killing himself.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.930
Thank goodness...

16:41.840 --> 16:43.770
Thank you, everyone.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.740
I'm blessed with such wonderful companions.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.840
He looks so happy in his sleep.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.440
Guess it was worth almost killing himself.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.950
After all that work, I'm sorry to say this...

16:54.280 --> 16:57.950
But giant boar tastes too strong, 
so I can't use it.

17:01.180 --> 17:01.960
Shh!

17:02.260 --> 17:03.750
You'll wake him up!

17:05.700 --> 17:09.220
<i>The Crescent Moon Alliance 
members are all so nice.</i>

17:12.970 --> 17:14.170
Yes...

17:14.170 --> 17:17.470
I'm sure it's due to Marie's kindness

17:17.940 --> 17:20.290
and sunflower-like smile.

17:21.730 --> 17:25.190
Actually, I've made a guild of my own.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.580
I'll introduce you to them soon.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.390
Our preparations are progressing.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.070
Hold out just a little longer.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.580
It'll be okay,

17:44.030 --> 17:45.730
Minori... Tohya.

Shiroe said that?

18:00.060 --> 18:00.860
Yeah.

18:03.710 --> 18:04.560
I see.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.020
Is this okay?

18:08.650 --> 18:11.760
Is this really okay?

18:15.340 --> 18:16.610
Chief, did you know this?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.920
When this was a game, 
these buildings were just background.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.240
But now they appear to be zones for purchase.

18:23.860 --> 18:25.340
So it seems.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.370
And that isn't all...

18:28.030 --> 18:31.420
Every city and building in the world is for sale.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.680
But they're astronomically expensive.

18:34.180 --> 18:40.930
Then should we buy Tokyo Station 
as the Log Horizon base?

18:42.390 --> 18:43.350
No.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.850
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.030
Shiro and Master Nyanta, it's been a long time.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.200
Hey, Soujirou.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.280
Souji, I hear you've started your own guild?

19:00.490 --> 19:04.190
Yes, it's called the West Wind Brigade.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.290
<b>Soujirou Theta  
Race/ Human 
Samurai, Lv. 90 
West Wind Brigade</b>

19:04.190 --> 19:09.910
It's a small guild, but as powerful 
as the biggest ones.

19:11.110 --> 19:11.790
Not at all...

19:12.510 --> 19:18.300
We were just getting things set up 
when the Apocalypse happened.

19:18.750 --> 19:24.180
Since the Tea Party disbanded, 
I hadn't been logging in as often.

19:24.630 --> 19:28.310
Are Nazuna and Miss Saki still with you?

19:28.590 --> 19:30.190
Nazuna is still with me.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.110
She's as relaxed as ever.

19:33.690 --> 19:38.470
Saki, too, but she wasn't logged 
in during the Apocalypse.

19:39.390 --> 19:41.180
Hey, so, um...

19:41.180 --> 19:45.150
Are you still as popular with 
girls as you used to be?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.880
No, well...

19:47.880 --> 19:49.690
It's nice to be young.

19:50.370 --> 19:51.830
A-Anyway...

19:52.470 --> 19:56.590
Why did you contact me?

19:56.970 --> 19:58.700
Oh, you see...

19:59.490 --> 20:02.890
I thought you didn't like me.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.350
Hmm? Why?

20:06.320 --> 20:07.650
Because, well...

20:08.250 --> 20:12.940
When I founded my guild, 
I invited you, but you didn't join.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.360
It wasn't like that.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.810
It wasn't that I didn't like you.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.660
Back then, I just didn't want 
anything to do with guilds.

20:23.810 --> 20:26.270
But after the Apocalypse, I realized

20:27.120 --> 20:31.320
that I had to make a place for myself...

20:32.410 --> 20:36.380
That I have to be one of those 
that protects others.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.090
I made a guild.

20:39.650 --> 20:43.300
There aren't many in it yet, 
and it's just getting started...

20:44.700 --> 20:46.720
But I'll only have a place for myself

20:47.170 --> 20:49.310
after I've made one for others.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.480
I finally realized that.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.360
So what did you want from me?

20:59.010 --> 21:03.020
What do you think of Akihabara, as it is now?

21:05.810 --> 21:08.120
I think it's a prison...

21:08.630 --> 21:09.670
A prison?

21:10.720 --> 21:12.250
Not only Akihabara.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.170
Depending on your point of view,

21:14.170 --> 21:16.540
this whole world is currently a prison.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.830
I have a way to improve it.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.030
And I need your help.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.260
All right!

21:26.600 --> 21:28.300
Huh? Are you sure?

21:28.300 --> 21:30.340
Don't you want to hear the plan?

21:30.830 --> 21:33.000
But you're busy, aren't you?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.690
I can't take up your time.

21:36.220 --> 21:39.110
And I'm a moron whose place 
is in the front row.

21:39.430 --> 21:43.010
Even if the Tea Party's best 
strategist told me the plan,

21:43.010 --> 21:44.320
I wouldn't understand half.

21:45.620 --> 21:46.820
Soujirou...

21:47.780 --> 21:50.090
You're a good kid, Souji.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.330
No...

21:56.090 --> 21:57.100
I have more burgers!

21:57.100 --> 21:58.340
I'll take three Crescent Burgers!

21:58.340 --> 22:00.370
Five super Crescent Burgers!

21:58.850 --> 22:01.840
While you wait, I'll take your orders!

22:01.840 --> 22:03.120
You're so cute...

22:03.120 --> 22:04.920
Please add me to your Friends List.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.720
Hey, stay in line, and follow the rules!

22:08.360 --> 22:14.230
Oh, so this Shiro guy wanted 
you to help with the store?

22:14.810 --> 22:15.750
Of course not.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.860
It's far more than just this.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.870
There's no end

22:21.880 --> 22:23.590
to his plans.

22:27.860 --> 22:32.490
<i>Now, then... Time for the plan's second stage.</i>

24:05.620 --> 24:07.230
Michitaka, of the Marine Agency.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.090
Karashin, of Shopping Street 8.

24:09.090 --> 24:10.550
Roderic, of the Roderic Merchant Guild.

24:10.980 --> 24:14.010
Masters of the largest crafting 
guilds gather in one place.

24:14.550 --> 24:17.970
Their trading partners are the Crescent 
Moon's sunflower and lily,

24:17.970 --> 24:19.660
Marielle and Henrietta.

24:19.660 --> 24:22.730
And the shadow that manipulates 
them from behind...

24:23.190 --> 24:25.030
Next time: Villain in Glasses.

24:23.190 --> 24:29.990
<b>Villain in Glasses</b>

24:25.460 --> 24:27.200
