00:05.038 --> 00:07.097
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.207 --> 00:11.007
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.111 --> 00:13.943
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.047 --> 00:18.450
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race #

00:20.387 --> 00:23.754
# Oh, boy
it's swell to say #

00:23.857 --> 00:27.258
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:28.461 --> 00:31.919
<i>#Good morning, U.S.A. ##</i>

00:38.104 --> 00:40.436
Jackson and I will be
in the executive dining room.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.474
We are not to be disturbed.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.066
Come on, number one.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.408
Must be nice being the boss's pet.

00:47.514 --> 00:50.347
I hear the executive
dining room is amazing!

00:50.450 --> 00:54.580
They say the Caesar salad is tossed
at your table by emperor penguins.

00:54.687 --> 00:57.155
That's obviously true. You know,
I've been here 10 years...

00:57.257 --> 00:59.157
and I haven't had lunch
with Bullock once.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.887
Unless you count that time
I was eating my sandwich on the can...

01:01.995 --> 01:05.123
and he came in to wash his hands.
I count that.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.026
I came up with a great nickname
forJackson today:

01:11.137 --> 01:13.264
<i>Jackson " Brownnose. "</i>

01:13.373 --> 01:16.740
- It's a little dated, but I think people will get it.
- Mmm, I hope so.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.743
I know you're stressed...

01:18.845 --> 01:22.337
but our Valentine's Day getaway
is just around the corner.

01:22.449 --> 01:25.941
- Oh, I can't wait to be alone with you at Lake Frasier.
- Me too.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.714
The bed in our cabin
has a solid oak headboard.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.757
And we're not leaving that lake
until you get a concussion.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.190
<i>Oh, " Staniel. "</i>

01:34.294 --> 01:37.320
Ah. I guess one of us should wonder
who that could be at this hour.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.455
- You want to do it?
- No, no. You've already started.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.468
Smith, I need you to come with me.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.470
I'm going on a dangerous mission...

01:45.572 --> 01:47.938
and I need my number one man.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.975
Number one?
I thoughtJackson was-

01:50.076 --> 01:53.102
Not anymore. He refused to stand in line
to get me opera tickets...

01:53.213 --> 01:55.113
because he had to go to some-

01:55.215 --> 01:59.208
Oh, I don't know.
Something to do with his son's bone marrow.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.049
So, I've decided
to make you number one.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.214
Me? Wow!

02:04.324 --> 02:07.487
Wait. You're taking AveryJunior
on a dangerous mission?

02:07.594 --> 02:10.119
I have no choice.
His night nurse quit...

02:10.229 --> 02:13.563
when she found the doll I made
out of her drain hair.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.861
Perhaps you could babysit, Francine.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.994
- Me?
- That's a great idea.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.971
You're adopted. The baby's adopted.
You have so much to talk about.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.974
- Sad stuff.
- Stan.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.477
Francine, did you hear what he said?
I'm his new number one.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.479
This is a huge deal.

02:28.581 --> 02:32.039
I feel like the sun is shining on me
for the first time in my life.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.417
Like a baby flower,
or a pale goblin-like creature...

02:35.522 --> 02:38.514
awakened from its subterranean slumber
by mining activities.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.525
Fine.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.892
I'll watch A.J. Tonight.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.831
- Uh- - Oh, he just cries like
that when he needs to be fed-

02:47.934 --> 02:49.959
and burped,
and changed, and held...

02:50.069 --> 02:52.003
and exercised,
and bathed, and oiled...

02:52.105 --> 02:54.005
and rocked to sleep
to Hindi lullabies.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.940
I can't sing in Hindi.
I can barely read it.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.910
Just tell him about your day.
That always puts me to sleep.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.518
Francine, look. My new crystal arachnid
of the month arrived.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.610
<i>Miss February is the Latrodectus...</i>

03:08.721 --> 03:10.621
a. k.a. The black widow.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.386
I've named her Courtney Love because
she killed her husband, she's full of toxins-

03:14.494 --> 03:17.156
What is that? What is that noise?

03:17.263 --> 03:21.063
- What is that?
- A.J. Bullock. I'm babysitting.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.863
Look, I don't have time
for you right now. I'm busy.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.938
Busy?
I was here first.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.033
I'm the baby!
I'm the drunk baby!

03:35.648 --> 03:38.913
Helping you pick up girls?
That's our dangerous mission?

03:39.018 --> 03:44.115
It is tonight, number one. Now, keep
your eyes out for the rarest of birds:

03:44.224 --> 03:46.692
The plump Asian skank.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.557
Well, unfortunately,
everyone here is tall and gorgeous.

03:49.662 --> 03:54.861
True. I guess I'll just have to
settle for some tight white meat.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.801
Excuse me.
Are you from Tennessee?

03:57.904 --> 04:00.930
<i>'Cause you're the only " ten I see. "</i>

04:01.040 --> 04:04.737
Other than this one-
which is yours to earn.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.109
Maybe we should try someplace else.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.775
I've been so lonely since my poor wife
was taken hostage in Fallujah.

04:11.884 --> 04:15.650
- But why not go get her, sir?
- I will not negotiate with terrorists.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.656
I can only imagine the monstrous things...

04:18.757 --> 04:22.990
those Sunni insurgents
are doing to my poor, sweet Miriam.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.463
I'm afraid she's doomed
to die alone.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.466
As am I.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.502
And that fat dude in the cape.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.662
You're not alone, sir.
You have A.J.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.969
Ah, I love the boy,
but I'm afraid he's part of the problem.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.602
Whenever I do manage to find a girl
willing to overlook my age...

04:39.712 --> 04:41.646
they bolt at the sight of the baby.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.514
The whole cradle to grave thing
in one look really freaks women out.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.518
Besides, every time
I look at A. J...

04:47.620 --> 04:49.884
I'm reminded that
he has no mother...

04:49.989 --> 04:51.889
and I have no mate.

04:51.991 --> 04:56.360
Without a woman in our lives,
A.J. And I will never truly be a family.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.158
That's terrible, sir.
Is there anything I can do to help?

04:59.265 --> 05:03.224
Actually, just having someone
to talk to gives me enormous comfort.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.236
I'm happy to do it, sir.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.238
Hmm? Hmm?

05:12.378 --> 05:15.040
Vroom, vroom.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.482
Oh, yeah. I'm a squirrel,
and that feels great.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.557
Oh, I've been up with
that baby five nights in a row.

05:25.658 --> 05:29.219
If I have to sit through
one more Carson Daly-

05:29.329 --> 05:32.560
Oh, I get it. You're friends
with Dave Navarro.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.862
<i>What now? Klaus!</i>

05:35.968 --> 05:39.961
He bumped into the coffee table.
I looked away for two seconds.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.202
I can't find my dinosaur stickers.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.939
Well, you'll have to look for 'em yourself.
A.J. Has a boo-boo.

05:48.047 --> 05:51.778
<i>I have a boo-boo too.</i>

05:51.884 --> 05:53.852
You did that on purpose.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.688
Roger! What the hell?

06:01.794 --> 06:04.092
Isn't it obvious?
Sibling rivalry.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.961
Roger's jealous of the new baby
in the house, so he's acting out.

06:07.066 --> 06:08.863
Yeah, what makes you such an expert?

06:08.968 --> 06:10.868
- Jo mama.
- Well played.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.098
There's my little pisha.
Did you sleep well?

06:17.210 --> 06:20.702
He didn't sleep at all.
He's not a football, Avery.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.943
You can't keep passing him off to me every
night and picking him up in the morning.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.986
- It's not good for him!
- You're right.

06:28.087 --> 06:31.921
It would be easier for all of us
if I left him here during the day too.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.924
Cheerio, Junior.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.257
Back-skate!

06:37.363 --> 06:40.594
Stan, how can you
let him do this to me?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.691
I'm not his permanent babysitter.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.032
You need to say no to your boss.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.800
I can't!
Number ones don't say no.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.671
Besides, it's just until I can find
a woman for Avery.

06:50.777 --> 06:54.235
That could take forever!
The guy's a weirdo.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.839
- No woman's gonna be interested in him.
- That's not true. He had a wife.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.851
That's it. His wife!

07:00.953 --> 07:02.580
Sometimes the best solution
is the easiest.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.219
Bullock's wife is being held by
a vicious gang of Islamic terrorists.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.993
I won't lie to you, men. My most optimistic
projections for this mission...

07:15.101 --> 07:17.831
predict everyone but me
and that guy will die.

07:19.305 --> 07:23.105
You'll live,
but you will not live well.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.439
We jump in 14 hours.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.444
I bet a frozen yogurt place
would do great out here.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.851
I can't believe
Stan rescued my wife.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.686
Yes. And A.J.'s going home
with his new mommy.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.888
Now I can practice exclamations
for when Stan and I get to the lake.

07:43.996 --> 07:47.591
<i>I think I'll go with-
"Oh, would you look at that. "</i>

07:47.700 --> 07:49.634
<i>That's her. How do I look?</i>

07:49.735 --> 07:52.169
Eh.

07:52.271 --> 07:55.035
- Hey, you.
- Where is she?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.974
She's in the back,
but, well, there's kind of a thing.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.308
I don't care!
She's my dry little raisin scone.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.008
Nothing can change
my feelings for her.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.016
Miriam!

08:06.118 --> 08:09.315
Die, American infidel!

08:09.422 --> 08:12.914
What the hell happened to her?

08:13.025 --> 08:15.926
Well, after three years
in captivity, she, uh-

08:16.028 --> 08:17.928
she kind of went Shia.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.055
- Brainwashed!
- And conditioned.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.361
L- I shouldn't be doing shtick.
Your wife is crazy.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.368
They turned her
into a terrorist, sir.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.667
That rabid jackal is not my wife.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.934
I never want to see her again.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.033
<i>Stan!</i>

08:32.144 --> 08:35.238
<i>Now we're stuck with
his baby and his wife!</i>

08:35.347 --> 08:38.840
Oh. You're taking the baby
for the first time in five days.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.715
Like that's really gonna make- Oh!

08:41.821 --> 08:45.120
Did you just poop? Oh. No. That's her.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.761
Smith here.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.297
Stan, I'm at my limit.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.560
I'm juggling a colicky toddler...

08:55.668 --> 08:59.229
a Vassar alum who thinks
she's a Sunni freedom fighter...

08:59.338 --> 09:02.569
and an alien who's acting like
a jealous four-year-old!

09:02.675 --> 09:06.202
- Four and a half!
- Aaah! Roger!

09:08.814 --> 09:11.715
- Allah is great!
- Miriam!

09:11.817 --> 09:14.547
She keeps using ketchup
packets as foot grenades.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.681
- It's probably just jet lag.
- A.J. And Miriam are Bullock's family.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.157
- He has to take them back.
- He will-

09:21.260 --> 09:23.888
just as soon as Miriam
gets back to her old self.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.659
Stan, our Valentine's Day getaway
is in two days.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.258
You have to say no to Bullock. Now!

09:30.369 --> 09:32.496
<i>How's it going, number one?</i>

09:32.605 --> 09:36.473
Uh, sir, your family's been staying with us
for what seems like forever, and-

09:36.576 --> 09:38.476
How would you like to join me...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.808
for lunch in the executive dining room?

09:44.016 --> 09:46.075
Oh, hello, Jackson.

09:46.185 --> 09:49.643
<i>You look terrible.</i>

09:54.527 --> 09:57.519
Jackson! Forget him.
He's a jerk.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.530
<i>I did everything right!</i>

09:59.632 --> 10:03.363
Francine, I had the most kick-ass lunch.
It kicked ass!

10:03.469 --> 10:07.200
Huh? What's going on?
Did you talk to Bullock?

10:07.306 --> 10:08.534
Oh. Well-

10:08.641 --> 10:10.734
You didn't, did you?

10:10.843 --> 10:14.108
Damn it, Stan!
I'm sick of taking care of this-A. J?

10:15.448 --> 10:18.212
- Where's A. J?
- This was taped to the refrigerator.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.445
<i>" I've taken your baby hostage.</i>

10:21.554 --> 10:23.454
U.S. Out of Middle East. "

10:23.556 --> 10:26.423
Oh, my God.
Where did she take him?

10:26.525 --> 10:29.892
<i>Is that Roger's French poster
of The Wizard of Oz?</i>

10:32.431 --> 10:35.059
- Miriam.
- Stay back, or I'll spray!

10:35.167 --> 10:39.331
- That baby is innocent!
- He's just another spoiled future infidel.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.202
Maybe. But he's your future infidel.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.039
- What?
- It's the truth. That baby is yours.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.410
Avery adopted him.
That makes you his mother.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.245
I'm- I'm a mommy?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.384
I will name him Muhammad.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.585
What?
It's a pretty name.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.324
Who's the caramel apple
of Mommy's eye?

11:07.433 --> 11:10.231
You are.
Yes, you are.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.463
Isn't it great that
you're not crazy anymore?

11:12.571 --> 11:15.438
Yeah. Nothing like the love
of an orphaned Indian child...

11:15.541 --> 11:17.771
to make you embrace
the ideals of the West again.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.777
<i>That's Avery!</i>

11:22.048 --> 11:25.176
Sticky bun.
Is it really you?

11:25.284 --> 11:26.945
It's really me.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.220
I can't believe it.

11:30.322 --> 11:32.517
We're finally gonna be rid
of Bullock's family.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.752
See? Everything's gonna be okay.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.694
And I got you something sexy
to wear to bed up at the lake.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.766
Oh.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.029
Let's go home, my nutty crumpet.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.036
I'll help you get your things.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.801
I believe you arrived with a small
piece of rope around your wrists?

11:50.910 --> 11:53.435
Number one, we have a problem.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.946
Stan, this is Coco.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.744
- Got any cigarettes?
- Uh, no.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.752
- Then go suck it.
- Isn't she great?

12:01.854 --> 12:04.345
We've become intimate
rather quickly.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.687
In fact, she's already
moved into my house.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.692
Her? Really?

12:08.794 --> 12:12.730
I know. She's Asian, she's loose,
and she's fat. I hit the trifecta!

12:12.832 --> 12:15.562
Avery, if your wife finds out
about this, she'll be devastated.

12:15.668 --> 12:20.332
Quite right. That's why I need you
to do something for me, number one.

12:20.439 --> 12:23.135
His mistress
is moving into our house?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.301
Just until he gets her
set up in an apartment.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.879
I'm gonna go soak it in your tub.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.449
And just like that, I'm gay.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.042
Stan, what about
our weekend getaway?

12:35.154 --> 12:38.317
I'm sorry, but Bullock doesn't want her
to be alone on Valentine's Day.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.324
I mean, what was I supposed to say?

12:40.426 --> 12:43.020
You were supposed to say no!

12:43.129 --> 12:45.324
Just forget it.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.059
I'm glad Bullock
makes you feel special.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.034
Maybe someday
I'll know how that feels.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.509
Francine, go upstairs
and pack your sex helmet.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.273
First thing tomorrow,
I'm saying no to Avery.

13:01.380 --> 13:05.146
You mean it?
Oh, Stan, thank you!

13:07.653 --> 13:10.451
I wonder if I'm a top or a bottom.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.956
If I had to guess, I'd say bottom.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.958
A reluctant bottom.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.960
Roger, what are you doing?

13:17.062 --> 13:20.554
Just trying to get a little attention
around here. There we go.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.401
Hey! Knock it off.
A.J.'s gone.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.835
What? A. J?
Where's A. J?

13:26.939 --> 13:28.907
Mr. And Mrs. Bullock took him home.

13:29.008 --> 13:32.876
But- But... I was gonna
teach him stuff.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.845
- I thought you'd be happy.
- It's not fair.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.143
I want my little bro-bro!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.960
Stan...

13:50.062 --> 13:52.656
I know how hard it was for you
to say no to Bullock.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.699
But what you did makes me feel...

13:54.800 --> 13:57.792
like the most important girl
in the whole world.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.395
I just told Bullock that I respect
my wife more than I need my job.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.499
Now, why don't you get on all fours
and grease yourself up like a pig.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.578
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.084
Here you go, Chopsticks.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.253
I gotta get back to my wife.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.396
Time for Coco to be Coco.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.945
<i>L- O-V-E. " Love. "</i>

14:41.046 --> 14:43.105
Because you love me so much...

14:43.215 --> 14:46.241
you wanted to be alone
with me all weekend.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.320
Your turn.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.480
<i>- " Blurazzy"? That's not a word.
- Then I pass.</i>

14:51.590 --> 14:56.084
<i>But you have two blanks.
You can spell " liar," " go"...</i>

14:56.195 --> 14:58.720
<i>" take," " smokes," " to"...</i>

14:58.831 --> 15:00.924
<i>" skank," " across"...</i>

15:01.033 --> 15:04.764
<i>- " the," " kale. "
- I pass! Well, time to get more firewood.</i>

15:04.870 --> 15:08.465
You've gone for firewood
every 10 minutes. Are you okay?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.474
- You seem distracted.
- No.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.942
This weekend is all about you.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.138
I am here for you.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.442
Gotta go.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.850
Hmm.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.926
Hey. How's it going?
Here are some smokes.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.622
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Wait. I'm bored. Get me a movie.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.595
Where am I gonna get
a movie around here?

15:33.699 --> 15:37.465
You're supposed to keep me happy.
Or do I need to call Avery?

15:37.569 --> 15:40.129
- Fine.
- Something with Matthew Perry.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.866
<i>Got it. Fools Rush In.</i>

15:41.974 --> 15:43.134
- Something good.
- Got it. Nothing.

15:46.912 --> 15:50.348
Time for mil-
Someone took my baby!

15:50.449 --> 15:54.010
<i>From now on, you and me
are " bestest" friends, okay?</i>

15:54.119 --> 15:56.781
<i>I'm even gonna let you play
with my " specialest" toys...</i>

15:56.889 --> 15:58.823
my crystal spider collection.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.621
<i>This is my " favoritest"
of all: A daddy longlegs.</i>

16:02.728 --> 16:06.027
Now, I want you to be
very, very careful with-

16:10.569 --> 16:12.867
What the-

16:19.611 --> 16:22.341
He started it.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.348
So you were gonna
drown him in the lake?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.350
- Well, how do you kill babies?
- Shut up!

16:26.452 --> 16:28.352
This whole situation
is out of control.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.252
Well, all you have to do
is say no to your boss.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.257
Yeah, I've been paying attention.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.089
Damn it. I'm already late
getting back to Francine.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.629
I don't have time to bring
this baby to the Bullocks.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.132
Do you have time for a complicated scheme
that'll solve all your problems?

16:42.234 --> 16:45.601
- Roger, this is no time to sell me on Christianity.
- Just give me your phone.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.434
Hello?

16:48.540 --> 16:51.737
I have your baby. Bring-

16:51.844 --> 16:54.108
I don't know-
a thousand dollars or something...

16:54.213 --> 16:56.204
to cabin number two at Frasier Lake.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.546
You idiot! Bullock's mistress
is in cabin number two.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.085
If they go there,
then Miriam will find out about Coco.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.951
Exactly. Bullock will be caught,
he'll have to dump Coco...

17:05.057 --> 17:06.991
and she'll be out of
your life forever.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.026
Wow, Roger.
I'm impressed.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.097
Well, I get caught up in something
like this pretty much every week.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.257
- We better get this baby over to Coco's cabin.
- You go.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.929
I'm just gonna stare at the lake
and think about how I almost killed a baby.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.581
Look, I need you to watch this baby.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.379
And don't try to sleep with it,
because it doesn't have any money.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.130
- I'm going home.
- What? Look. Honey.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.565
I know I've been a little preoccupied,
but that's all over.

17:50.669 --> 17:54.628
I promise. From now on,
you have my full, undivided attention.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.765
<i>Hello?</i>

17:56.875 --> 17:59.776
A.J.'s been kidnapped.
I need you to help me with the handoff.

17:59.878 --> 18:03.939
Help? No, no, no. No. You and Miriam
are supposed to do this yourselves.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.313
Cabin number two, Frasier Lake.
Ten minutes.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.886
Don't let me down, number one.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.022
- Hey, you know what we need? Cigarettes.
- Firewood.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.252
No. Right, right, right.
You're-You're firewood.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.632
Stan!

18:20.732 --> 18:23.462
- Where the hell are you going?
- You're gonna laugh.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.766
This was supposed to be
a romantic weekend!

18:26.872 --> 18:30.330
- How could you bring her here?
- I was hoping for a three-way?

18:30.442 --> 18:33.172
With that?
We talked about this.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.111
Did you even try to contact
ScarlettJohansson?

18:36.215 --> 18:39.707
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

18:39.818 --> 18:41.786
Nobody move!

18:41.887 --> 18:44.117
My little curried cupcake!

18:44.223 --> 18:46.783
Avery?

18:46.892 --> 18:49.793
- Coco.
- You know this woman?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.523
Oh, God.
Is this your wife?

18:52.631 --> 18:55.122
No wonder you're looking
for some yummy on the side.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.361
- What?
- Screw this.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.836
I'm gonna go back to being
the prettiest girl in Ohio.

19:00.939 --> 19:04.238
This is what you were doing
while I was a hostage?

19:04.343 --> 19:07.801
No, no. I didn't meet her
until after you came back.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.848
- What?
- Ooh, no.

19:10.949 --> 19:14.441
Sugar lump, I only strayed
because your absence was unbearable.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.453
My life was wretched too, you know.

19:16.555 --> 19:20.855
There's a difference, Avery.
I was forced into a filthy hole.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.927
You went in by choice.

19:23.028 --> 19:26.486
M- M-Miriam, p-p-p-put the gun down.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.692
I'm- I'm sorry.
Can't we- Can't we start again?

19:29.801 --> 19:31.701
Sure. Let's start
at the beginning-

19:31.803 --> 19:33.896
like when you got down
on one knee and proposed.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.442
Come on, AveryJunior.
You shouldn't see Daddy like this.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.842
My kneecap is shattered.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.880
- Stan, take me to the hospital.
- Now?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.211
Yes, now!
Oh, my God!

19:45.317 --> 19:48.548
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- Help me, Stan.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.588
- No. -
What? - What?

19:50.689 --> 19:54.455
I'm done. I've been running myself ragged.
And for what?

19:54.560 --> 19:58.052
So I could feel like number one
while making you feel like number two?

19:58.163 --> 20:02.259
<i>Well, no more. From now on,
I'm gonna be your number one.</i>

20:02.367 --> 20:05.336
<i>Stan, I appreciate the gesture...</i>

20:05.437 --> 20:08.201
but for God's sake,
the man needs you.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.140
- You can't say no to him.
- Wow.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.473
Is that how I used to sound?

20:13.579 --> 20:15.604
What a selfish jerk I've been.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.444
<i>I think I'm passing out.
I smell pennies.</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:20.745
Come on, honey.
Let's go have our weekend.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.252
You're serious?
You're leaving?

20:23.355 --> 20:26.085
Here. Call Dick.

20:26.191 --> 20:29.058
He'd love to be your number one.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.061
Stan, is he gonna be okay?

20:31.163 --> 20:34.189
More importantly,
we're gonna be okay.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.063
- Just okay.
- We can't just leave him.

20:39.004 --> 20:42.167
<i>Oh! I'm hallucinating!</i>

20:42.274 --> 20:46.005
<i>Half polar bear, half Hugh Grant,
will you please help me?</i>

20:46.111 --> 20:48.579
<i>No? No. Quite right.</i>

20:48.680 --> 20:53.845
<i>I'm sure you're busy
with all the films and harp seals.</i>

21:03.128 --> 21:05.858
<i>Vroom, vroom.</i>

21:05.964 --> 21:08.125
Hello?
Yeah, this is Dick.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.895
Yes, sir! I'd love to be your number one.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.631
I'll be right there.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.137
Bye. Have a beautiful time.
