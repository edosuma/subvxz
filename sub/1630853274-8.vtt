WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:07.174
- <i>John, this is--</i>
- Martha Jennings.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.379
This is Winzola McLendon.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.382
She is my biographer
and a first-rate journalist.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.083
I know my mom
is a lot to handle,

00:16.117 --> 00:17.385
but don't give up on her.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.552
Frank Wills.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.755
<i>I'm going back to Georgia.
I don't belong here.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:22.223
Alexander Butterfield,

00:22.256 --> 00:23.591
former aide to HR Haldeman,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.259
said that President Nixon ordered

00:25.292 --> 00:27.762
<i>secret electronic
listening devices</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.264
<i>in the president's Oval Office
and on his telephones.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:32.633
<i>I got word
on Sirica's preliminary ruling.</i>

00:32.666 --> 00:34.335
He's recommending
a sentence of five years.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.803
What the hell did I go
through all this for, then?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.472
Because you wanted to do
what was best for the country.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.408
- Oh, fuck.
- The good news

00:40.441 --> 00:42.343
is that you can still
appeal for leniency

00:42.376 --> 00:43.377
if you cooperate further.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.146
<i>The special prosecutor's
going after Haldeman</i>

00:45.179 --> 00:46.747
<i>and Ehrlichman
and-and then Mitchell.</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:49.316
No, no way, I am not
ratting on anybody else.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.086
I'd understand if you wanna
move on, find somebody else.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.722
<i>I am yours.</i>

00:54.755 --> 00:57.224
<i>When a man's
trial by fire arrives,</i>

00:57.258 --> 00:59.627
<i>he must meet it with the power
of his indomitable will.</i>

01:08.569 --> 01:09.804
The trying things

01:09.837 --> 01:11.338
that have been imposed on me,

01:11.372 --> 01:12.640
<i>no one in this country</i>

01:12.673 --> 01:14.408
realizes or understands.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.644
You have ruined everything
in your life,

01:16.677 --> 01:18.846
in my life--your reputation.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.080
What's going on?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.682
<i>Uh, go back
to your room, honey.</i>

01:21.715 --> 01:25.186
I should have had them
go harder on you in California.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.520
<i>I'm leaving you.</i>

01:26.554 --> 01:28.255
<i>I called Dad.</i>

01:28.289 --> 01:30.324
I'm gonna stay with him
for a couple months.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.226
And I'm taking Marty with me.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.896
Huh.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.852
<i>President Richard Nixon</i>

03:04.885 --> 03:07.321
<i>reversed his ground
and agreed to comply</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:08.956
<i>with a Federal Circuit Court order</i>

03:09.189 --> 03:10.724
to surrender
his Watergate tapes

03:10.758 --> 03:12.826
to Federal District Court judge
John Sirica.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.595
<i>But soon
the president's lawyers</i>

03:14.628 --> 03:16.830
<i>disclosed that two tapes
were absent</i>

03:16.864 --> 03:19.867
<i>and a third had that
mysterious 18-minute buzz.</i>

03:19.900 --> 03:21.535
<i>The White House's
only explanation</i>

03:21.569 --> 03:23.537
<i>was that the president's
personal secretary,</i>

03:23.571 --> 03:24.572
<i>Rose Mary Wood,</i>

03:24.605 --> 03:26.407
<i>might have accidentally
hit the wrong button</i>

03:26.440 --> 03:28.375
<i>in the foot pedal while
reaching for the telephone.</i>

03:28.409 --> 03:30.744
So I'm transcribing the tape,

03:30.778 --> 03:32.713
and then I reach for the phone,

03:32.746 --> 03:34.448
and my foot presses down

03:34.481 --> 03:36.951
on the pedal
that erases the tape.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.354
<i>The public opinion polls,</i>

03:40.387 --> 03:41.755
<i>always a revered source</i>

03:41.789 --> 03:43.490
of comfort and pleasure
for the president,

03:43.524 --> 03:44.925
have now turned sour.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.828
<i>It would be nice
in a crisis-weary country</i>

03:47.861 --> 03:49.296
<i>if the committee could decide</i>

03:49.330 --> 03:51.298
<i>by, say, eight o'clock
tomorrow morning</i>

03:51.332 --> 03:53.367
<i>whether Mr. Nixon
ought to be impeached.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.002
<i>But with ground rules to set</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:57.671
<i>and with masses
of possible evidence to sift,</i>

03:57.705 --> 04:00.841
that decision is likely
to be months away.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.643
<i>The feeling grows
that if the president</i>

04:02.676 --> 04:04.712
<i>survives in office
through the spring,</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:07.881
<i>he may, if his health holds,
finish out his term</i>

04:07.915 --> 04:10.317
<i>but that surviving in office
through the spring</i>

04:10.351 --> 04:11.819
<i>won't be easy.</i>

04:11.852 --> 04:14.688
<i>All sides agree that things
simply cannot continue</i>

04:14.722 --> 04:17.524
<i>as they have been
for most of '73.</i>

04:17.558 --> 04:18.759
<i>As for those complicit</i>

04:18.792 --> 04:19.994
<i>in the president's deceptions,</i>

04:20.027 --> 04:21.829
<i>only one question remains:</i>

04:21.862 --> 04:23.297
<i>why would these men,</i>

04:23.330 --> 04:25.032
<i>men of intelligence
and accomplishment,</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:27.301
<i>willingly subsume themselves
for a man</i>

04:27.334 --> 04:31.405
<i>as patently duplicitous
as Richard Milhous Nixon?</i>

04:31.438 --> 04:33.874
<i>What, in short,
were they thinking?</i>

04:43.317 --> 04:44.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

04:44.918 --> 04:45.919
You don't wanna get
a photo with us?

04:45.953 --> 04:46.954
Say cheese, Mitchell.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.893
Attorney General Mitchell.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.328
The rumor
is that you're facing

04:54.361 --> 04:55.629
upwards of ten years in prison
if convicted.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.864
Doesn't that scare you?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.866
Could be worse.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.002
I could have been sentenced
to life with Martha.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.809
Here on your X-ray,
you can see

05:08.842 --> 05:10.644
the sunburst appearance

05:10.678 --> 05:12.312
where the wrist is injured.

05:13.447 --> 05:17.017
The fracture could heal
very slowly or not at all.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.854
In addition,
an excess of calcium

05:20.888 --> 05:22.056
is entering your bloodstream...

05:22.089 --> 05:23.524
Hmm.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.927
...that could cause
neurological problems like

05:26.960 --> 05:30.364
confusion and memory loss,

05:30.397 --> 05:32.099
weakness, and exhaustion.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.671
You may soon find yourself
in a lot of pain.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.637
My, <i>The Post,</i>

06:10.671 --> 06:12.873
they know how to treat
their staff-writers well.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.109
No, this is my editor's scotch.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.511
He's on vacation.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.946
Well, I'm glad you
finally escaped

06:18.979 --> 06:20.013
from that pink ghetto

06:20.047 --> 06:21.615
you were stuck in.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.517
Oh, just soda for me, please.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.452
Oh.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.955
All right.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.557
I've never known you to
turn down a celebratory drink.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.658
I'm impressed.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.027
You've never known me to turn down
any kind of drink before.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.932
What exactly
are we celebrating?

06:40.467 --> 06:41.568
Are you kidding?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.639
Martha, everything that you
said about the president...

06:47.141 --> 06:49.543
...all the things that they
mocked you for, it's--

06:51.044 --> 06:53.647
You're the only one who told
the truth from the beginning.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.883
Well, three cheers for me.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.821
You know, this is a new start.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.090
Maybe you should move
out of that old apartment,

07:03.123 --> 07:04.858
find someplace
that suits you better.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.127
Well, it suits me fine.
What's wrong with it?

07:07.161 --> 07:09.663
I don't know.
Just seems kind of haunted.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.765
Well, when you get
to be my age,

07:11.799 --> 07:12.933
you get to know the ghosts.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.770
Bottoms up. Nice to see you.

07:16.804 --> 07:17.805
You too.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.676
What happened there?

07:22.709 --> 07:26.613
Oh, I took a little tupsie
on the stairs a few weeks ago.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.182
Oh, no.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.118
Well, I have something that
I think is gonna cheer you up.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.452
<i>What is it?</i>

07:33.220 --> 07:35.088
Our book.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.925
A very rough first draft.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.159
And I know that the publisher

07:39.193 --> 07:40.928
canceled our contract, technically,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
but I just couldn't help it;
I had to finish it.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.998
And I think it's good.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.067
Actually, I think
it's really good.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.002
Oh, that's wonderful, dear.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.206
I thought you'd be happy.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.875
No, I am.
I'm happy, and I'm grateful.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.543
Well...

07:56.577 --> 07:58.612
Mm, there's a reason
I stopped by.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.080
I wanted to-

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
I wanted to ask you a favor.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.951
Oh, okay.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.919
You know what happened
with me and my husband.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.221
That was a long time coming,

08:07.254 --> 08:09.756
and I've made peace
with it, but...

08:09.790 --> 08:11.825
Marty--

08:11.859 --> 08:13.794
her birthday's on Tuesday,
and I promised

08:13.827 --> 08:15.696
that I would drive down
and visit her at school,

08:15.729 --> 08:17.731
and I wondered
if you might accompany me.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.000
Oh, wow.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.101
I don't know if I should.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.135
Oh, it would mean
so much to me.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.904
She just loves you to death.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.244
All right, well, let me see if
I can get that day off, okay?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.045
All right. You let me know.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.080
I will.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.916
And more importantly,

08:35.949 --> 08:37.885
who is the man
in that brown jacket there?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.587
Oh. That's Bob Woodward.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.023
That's--now, he
does not look like the gasbag

08:43.056 --> 08:44.224
I have heard he is.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.759
Shh! Martha!

08:45.792 --> 08:47.127
Call his name.
Get him to look this way.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.662
I'm not gonna do that.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.863
Bob.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.265
What are you...

08:51.298 --> 08:52.933
It sounded more like a sheep.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.568
...doing?

09:05.579 --> 09:06.947
All right.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.615
Give me the damage,
but make it quick.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.817
It's been a very long day.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.152
Let's start with the good news.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.288
Thanks to a tax loophole,
we're able to run your bail

09:14.321 --> 09:15.856
through the corporate account,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.858
so little victory there.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.026
Hooray.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.261
As for the bad news, uh,

09:21.295 --> 09:24.564
those Oval Office tapes
were not good for us.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.767
Based upon the transcripts,
it looks like

09:26.800 --> 09:28.869
they've got you dead to rights
on all the charges:

09:28.902 --> 09:31.638
conspiracy, perjury,
obstruction of justice.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.673
It's all there, clear as day.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.807
Okay, sweetheart,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.943
could you find
the burgundy stem?

09:36.877 --> 09:37.878
Yeah, um...

09:37.911 --> 09:40.047
John...

09:40.080 --> 09:41.682
this is serious.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.017
I didn't hire you to inform me

09:44.051 --> 09:46.119
that there is an iceberg
up ahead.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.789
I hired you to steer the ship

09:48.822 --> 09:50.857
around the fucking thing.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.930
On the, um, sunny side
of the street,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.832
it looks like you might be
out of the woods

09:58.865 --> 10:00.667
with the whole
Martha situation.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.937
What are we talking about?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.340
We received
the settlement papers.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.775
She hasn't agreed
to all of our terms.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.111
She would like to maintain
ownership of the apartment

10:11.144 --> 10:13.146
and visitation rights
with Marty.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.984
But she's relented
on just about everything else.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.385
She's giving you an out here.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.287
<i>All you gotta do is sign
those documents, and...</i>

10:21.355 --> 10:22.789
<i>...you'll finally be rid
of her.</i>

10:27.828 --> 10:30.630
Any update
on the burgundy stem?

10:30.664 --> 10:32.799
Try this one, Mr. Mitchell.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.976
We have a winner.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.952
Hey, Chuck,
those <i>cafones</i> in Washington,

10:51.985 --> 10:54.354
are they gonna impeach or what?

10:54.388 --> 10:56.223
Uh, it depends; they--

10:56.256 --> 10:58.125
they have the votes
in the House.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.694
Yeah, but the Senate's
trickier.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.996
Much more visibility
in that chamber.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.298
<i>Ah, if Goldwater
votes to convict,</i>

11:05.332 --> 11:07.000
<i>they'll all follow along.</i>

11:07.034 --> 11:08.201
<i>What's the matter, Dean?</i>

11:08.235 --> 11:09.936
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

11:09.970 --> 11:11.438
I think I need some new gloves.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.040
Princess is in a little funk.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.876
He had a visit
from the feds earlier on.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.910
Mm-hmm.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.413
The feds? Who was it?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.981
Watergate task force guys.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.784
They want him to testify now
against Mitchell.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.787
What did you tell them?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.221
What do you think I told them?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.093
I told them no, for God's sake.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.729
As if a couple of tapes
are gonna convince me

11:35.762 --> 11:36.963
to turn on anybody at this point.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.999
Oh, tape recordings?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.967
Copies of all my conversations

11:41.001 --> 11:43.270
with the president
in the Oval Office.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.938
Left them as a gift.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.473
Hell of a gift.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.974
I don't know.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.010
Maybe they figured I'd hear
something new in them.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.445
It's unbelievable.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.480
I mean, I testified against
the president, for God's sake.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.348
It's not like
I'm some criminal.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.751
That's funny.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.187
'Cause I ain't no criminal neither.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.923
Vito, Carmine,
you guys criminals?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.324
No, no, no, none of that.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.759
No, hell, no.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.229
<i>Look at his face.</i>

13:04.818 --> 13:08.822
DEAN I think there's no doubt about
the seriousness of the problem we've got.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.190
It'll cost money.
It's dangerous.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.493
Nobody, nothing--people around here
are not pros at this sort of thing.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.362
This is the sort of thing
mafia people can do.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.164
You got to wash money and all that sort,

13:17.197 --> 13:18.999
you know, if you get a hundred thousand
out of a bank

13:19.032 --> 13:21.268
and it all comes in serialized bills.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.171
I would say these people
are going to cost a million dollars

13:24.204 --> 13:26.540
over the next two years.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.842
NIXON You, on the money,
if you need the money

13:28.875 --> 13:30.844
you could get a million dollars.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.345
And you could get it in cash.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.947
I know where it could be gotten.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.349
I want to look at any sensitive areas

13:36.383 --> 13:38.185
around where Jews are involved.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.053
See, the Jews are all
through the government.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.222
You can't trust the bastards,
they turn on you.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.024
You know what happened
to the Greeks?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.926
Homosexuality destroyed them.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.395
The last six Roman Emperors were fags.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.864
We are up against an enemy,
a conspiracy.

13:50.897 --> 13:53.033
They're using any means.
Is that clear?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.534
I don't give a shit about the law.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.369
The press is the enemy.

13:56.403 --> 14:00.273
The establishment is the enemy.
The professors are the enemy.

14:00.307 --> 14:04.211
DEAN Just hunker down,
fight it at every corner, every turn.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.946
Don't let people testify.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.215
Cover it up is what
we're really talking about.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.482
- Just keep it buried.
- Oh, fuck.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.386
We have a cancer close
to the presidency that's growing.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.621
It's growing daily.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.900
Fuck.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.889
Hello.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.597
Yes, I'll be down in a minute.
Thank you, Zolton.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.932
Thank you.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.472
Oh.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.636
I'm sorry. Some days
it's impossible to be me.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.704
- Oh, that's okay.
- How are you?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.140
Oh, I'm good, yeah. I'm good.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.475
Oh, eh--

16:48.508 --> 16:51.277
Antonio, he's a photographer
from <i>Life</i> magazine.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.345
He's on loan for the day

16:52.379 --> 16:54.781
to take pictures
of the birthday party.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.250
- Oh, that's-that's nice.
- Yeah.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.651
- What?
- Oh, I just--

16:58.685 --> 17:00.720
I mean, I think
that it might spook Marty

17:00.754 --> 17:02.188
a little bit if you show up

17:02.222 --> 17:04.424
and you have a whole entourage,
you know?

17:04.457 --> 17:06.259
- Maybe--
- I see your point.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.294
Okay, we'll have him wait
in the car a little bit.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.530
Yeah. Antonio, this is Winnie.
Winnie, this is Antonio.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.564
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.599
Nice to meet you.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.200
Uh, so you'll just
stay in the car

17:14.234 --> 17:16.536
till Marty gets comfortable;
she's shy.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.771
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's a little shy.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.205
- Morning.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

17:19.239 --> 17:20.740
- Thank you.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

17:23.309 --> 17:24.444
Oof!

17:28.615 --> 17:29.749
Have you lost some weight?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.284
<i>It's a good day for a drive.</i>

17:43.797 --> 17:45.832
Oh, oh.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.301
You all right?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.670
Oh, it's my wrist
just hasn't healed.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.138
Oh.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.110
Oh. Mitchell defaulted
on the heating bill.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.512
He's trying to drive me
out of the apartment.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.848
That's awfully unkind of him.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.750
<i>Well, it's just his way now.</i>

18:04.717 --> 18:07.287
Mitchell couldn't stand Nixon

18:07.320 --> 18:09.088
when he first met him;
he thought he was

18:09.122 --> 18:11.624
insecure and brittle,
which he is.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.260
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

18:14.294 --> 18:18.331
How does a man like
John Mitchell, brilliant man,

18:18.364 --> 18:21.801
get tangled up in such a mess

18:21.835 --> 18:24.604
for a conglomerate of nothing
like Richard Nixon?

18:27.507 --> 18:29.242
I don't understand it.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.213
I don't think I ever will.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.223
<i>I, as the chairman,</i>

18:43.256 --> 18:46.226
<i>have been guided
by a simple principle</i>

18:46.259 --> 18:49.762
<i>that the law must deal fairly
with every man.</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.297
<i>The ones
that are cute on the front</i>

18:51.331 --> 18:53.266
<i>- are terrible inside.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

18:53.299 --> 18:54.734
<i>I don't understand
some of these things.</i>

18:54.767 --> 18:56.169
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:56.202 --> 18:58.204
<i>Come on.
We gotta find a nice one.</i>

18:58.238 --> 19:01.875
"A daughter is a special gift
whose heart is made of gold,

19:01.908 --> 19:03.543
a beautiful flower's blossom."

19:03.576 --> 19:05.278
Oh, please stop.
Who writes these things?

19:05.311 --> 19:07.213
Christ,
they really are terrible.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.581
You should write cards.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.450
You're so sweet and sincere.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.687
That's a nice little kitty.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.190
- Yeah, lots of kitties.
- No, not a birthday.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.894
You know, Martha,
I've been meaning to apologize to you.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.229
What for?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.434
You know, back when everything
started, I just--

19:29.636 --> 19:32.805
I'm not sure
that I really believed you.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.708
I know I acted like I did, but...

19:35.742 --> 19:37.944
I was just as bad
as everyone else.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.613
I'm sorry.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.848
I... can't imagine

19:41.881 --> 19:44.217
how that must have been
for you...

19:44.250 --> 19:45.952
not to be believed.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.589
Must have felt like you didn't have
a friend in the world.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.624
Well, that's not true now.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.394
I do have a friend.
I have a best friend right here.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.365
Thanks.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.368
- Now help me find a card.
- Okay.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.671
Uh...

20:06.673 --> 20:07.674
...here.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.911
Together, that's it.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.847
Oh, that's nice.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.650
That's real nice.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.587
Let's get the envelope
for that one.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.722
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.000
Could you direct me
to the ladies', please?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.868
Oh, yeah. Right over there.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.279
Was that Martha Mitchell?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.515
Thanks.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.778
Can you believe
this shit?

21:51.811 --> 21:54.714
There might be up to five
articles of impeachment now.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.382
Fucking shame.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.017
You can say that again.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.852
Do that
to an American president

21:59.886 --> 22:01.921
just to score political points?

22:03.456 --> 22:04.490
Wait, what?

22:04.524 --> 22:05.792
There's no evidence
the president

22:05.825 --> 22:07.427
ordered the break-in;
there's no fucking evidence.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.729
So we're just gonna forget
that he obstructed justice?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
Does that not count
for anything?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.466
He isn't perfect.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.636
I didn't vote for him twice
because he's perfect.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.972
You voted for Nixon
after you knew about Watergate?

22:20.006 --> 22:23.342
I'm a law-and-order guy.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.112
Anyway, you impeach him now,
and you start destroying

22:26.345 --> 22:27.780
what little trust
the American people

22:27.814 --> 22:30.483
have in their government,
and that--

22:30.516 --> 22:31.818
that's a slippery slope.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.053
What is it with this
slippery slope shit?

22:34.087 --> 22:35.388
What do you mean?

22:35.421 --> 22:36.756
People like you
always say that,

22:36.789 --> 22:38.458
like you got
nothing else to say.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.692
"It's a slippery slope."

22:39.726 --> 22:41.761
Yeah, everything's
a slippery slope.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.429
"Oh, honey,
don't take that aspirin.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.530
"You don't know
what might happen.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.565
It's a slippery slope."

22:45.598 --> 22:46.766
"Welfare for the poor?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.801
We can't do that.
That's a slippery slope."

22:48.835 --> 22:50.069
"You wanna police
the government?

22:50.103 --> 22:52.105
"That's a fucking slippery
shit slope

22:52.138 --> 22:53.406
"if I've ever seen one.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.907
"Let's not do that.
You know what?

22:54.941 --> 22:57.577
As a matter of fact,
let's not fucking do anything."

22:59.712 --> 23:00.980
You okay, buddy?

23:02.615 --> 23:04.784
Just because
certain actions we take

23:04.817 --> 23:06.753
in some imaginary future

23:06.786 --> 23:09.021
might theoretically lead
to disastrous outcomes

23:09.055 --> 23:10.523
somewhere down the line

23:10.556 --> 23:11.991
shouldn't stop us from doing

23:12.024 --> 23:14.927
what's objectively
morally right

23:14.961 --> 23:17.063
in the present.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.698
Correct?

23:21.434 --> 23:25.571
Of course, the idea of any kind
of objective morality...

23:28.007 --> 23:29.742
- It's a slippery slope?
- Hey, I didn't say it.

23:29.776 --> 23:30.810
- Fuck you.
- I didn't say it.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.178
Fuck you.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.016
So what's the new director
got you on after this?

23:37.049 --> 23:40.753
Wants me to pick up the slack
for the whole department.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.655
What about you?
What's he got you on?

23:46.025 --> 23:50.163
They're trying to... ship me
back to translation detail.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.534
I think I'm lucky that
those Cubans spoke Spanish.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.972
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been
anywhere near something this big.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.943
Yeah. You know what?

24:05.678 --> 24:06.946
Fuck those guys.

24:06.979 --> 24:10.750
What are you gonna you do, right?
You gonna sue 'em?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.787
Ah, there he is.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.122
Belle of the ball.

24:18.057 --> 24:22.028
Mr. Dean, ready to testify
against your old boss?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.499
<i>John Dean.</i>

24:26.532 --> 24:29.035
Hey, did you ever listen
to those tapes we sent?

24:29.068 --> 24:31.504
<i>Yeah. Thanks for those.</i>

24:31.537 --> 24:33.606
They really took me back.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.175
You already knew everything
there was to know about Nixon.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.878
So... what was in there
that changed your mind

24:38.911 --> 24:41.714
about testifying
against your buddies?

24:41.747 --> 24:45.084
You ever hear your own voice
on a...

24:45.117 --> 24:46.919
tape recorder?

24:46.953 --> 24:50.223
Sounds strange, like somebody else,
like somebody you don't even know.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.863
Dean, can I ask you
a personal question?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.699
I mean, you're the one
with the gun.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.536
Why'd you do it?

25:03.569 --> 25:05.905
I mean,
you're-you're a smart guy.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.707
At least you seem like
a smart guy.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.141
I mean, why would you agree

25:09.175 --> 25:11.844
to cover up
some bullshit break-in

25:11.878 --> 25:13.813
for a president you knew
damn well was gonna

25:13.846 --> 25:16.515
throw you under the bus
the second the shit hit the fan?

25:18.651 --> 25:19.919
Why'd you do it?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.189
You really wanna know?

25:23.222 --> 25:24.523
I do.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.194
Poshinaya foam.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.098
- What's that?
- Poshinaya foam.

25:32.131 --> 25:35.001
It's the best high-density
cushion foam in the world.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.236
They only make it
in the Eastern Bloc.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.538
Apparently when you sit
in a seat

25:39.572 --> 25:40.740
made with Poshinaya foam,

25:40.773 --> 25:42.575
it's like
you're floating on air.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.577
Somebody back in law school
once told me

25:44.610 --> 25:48.281
that Jack Kennedy got the CIA

25:48.314 --> 25:50.182
to make a special deal
with Khrushchev

25:50.216 --> 25:52.785
to get every seat
on <i>Air Force One</i>

25:52.818 --> 25:54.720
cushioned with the stuff.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.222
- No shit.
- <i>No shit.</i>

25:56.255 --> 25:58.691
And when I first heard that,
I remember thinking,

25:58.724 --> 26:01.227
"Man, I-I would do anything

26:01.260 --> 26:03.696
to sit in one of those seats
before I die."

26:03.729 --> 26:05.298
Now, just think about it:

26:05.331 --> 26:06.666
riding with the president

26:06.699 --> 26:08.601
30,000 feet
above the rest of the world,

26:08.634 --> 26:11.203
your whole ass

26:11.237 --> 26:12.905
cradled by a cloud.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.108
<i>I mean, how can you know
about a-a thing like that</i>

26:16.142 --> 26:17.710
and just go back
to living your life

26:17.743 --> 26:18.945
the way you were
living it before,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.313
with your ordinary cushions

26:20.346 --> 26:22.214
and your ordinary existence?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.984
It's-it's impossible.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.957
All right, so did you get
to sit in one?

26:30.990 --> 26:32.124
What's that?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.159
The-the foam.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.260
- The foam.
- The <i>Air Force One</i> seat.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.962
Oh.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.931
Yeah. Yeah. A few times.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.668
How'd it feel?

26:46.772 --> 26:48.374
Better than you can
ever imagine.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.679
<i>This court is now in session,</i>

27:26.712 --> 27:29.281
<i>with the Honorable
Judge John Sirica presiding.</i>

27:30.716 --> 27:32.785
<i>Uh, we have
a pretty busy schedule today.</i>

27:32.818 --> 27:36.088
Mr. Ben-Veniste, would you like
to call your first witness?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.890
The special
prosecutor would like to call

27:37.923 --> 27:41.027
Mr. George Gordon Battle Liddy
to the stand.

28:06.185 --> 28:10.423
Mr. Liddy, much has been made
of your defiant silence

28:10.456 --> 28:11.991
during these proceedings.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.694
<i>But we wanted to give you
one more chance</i>

28:15.728 --> 28:17.830
to set the record straight.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.933
<i>Do you or do you not recall</i>

28:20.966 --> 28:25.404
the meeting
of January 27, 1972,

28:25.438 --> 28:29.375
commonly referred to as
the Operation Gemstone meeting?

28:36.282 --> 28:38.384
How about the subsequent
meeting of February fourth

28:38.417 --> 28:41.253
in which you presented
your revised plans

28:41.287 --> 28:43.823
to former Attorney General Mi--

28:50.796 --> 28:51.864
Excuse me.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.500
<i>Excuse me.</i>

28:56.335 --> 28:58.437
Mr. Liddy.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.505
Oh, dear God.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.739
<i>Come to order, please.</i>

29:02.074 --> 29:03.909
Will somebody get this lunatic
out of my courtroom?

29:05.377 --> 29:06.479
Come on. Come on, let's go.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.081
<i>Come to order.</i>

29:10.883 --> 29:11.984
Get him out!

29:33.405 --> 29:34.473
What the hell's going on?

29:34.507 --> 29:36.208
Some witness
is going crazy in there.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.116
This is you, pal.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.425
Well, thanks for the ride.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.194
I'll see you around.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.462
Probably not.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.887
<i>My God, get the door.</i>

30:29.929 --> 30:31.964
Shut it!

30:48.047 --> 30:50.583
John Dean...

30:50.616 --> 30:52.184
as I live and breathe.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.255
Gordon.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.358
You're looking well.
You had a... haircut?

31:00.526 --> 31:01.594
<i>How-how you been?</i>

31:01.627 --> 31:04.330
<i>How's the--how's the--
how's the family?</i>

31:04.363 --> 31:06.332
Oh, oh, they're skippy, thanks.

31:10.169 --> 31:14.173
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you lately.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.143
- Is-is that so?
- Sure.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.645
You see, I've spent
a lot of time

31:19.878 --> 31:22.381
trapped in a cell,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.283
bedding down among beasts,

31:24.316 --> 31:26.285
and it's times like those
you can't help

31:26.318 --> 31:27.586
but think of the ones
on the outside

31:27.620 --> 31:30.089
who've taken
the coward's way out, and...

31:30.122 --> 31:32.424
you're the biggest coward
of them all, aren't you, John?

31:32.458 --> 31:35.294
Well, well, hang on
just a minute there, Gordon.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.263
I mean, I-I'm in prison too.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.498
Oh, I know.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.567
You've been in prison
your whole life.

31:49.675 --> 31:53.312
As part of my training
in the bureau, they...

31:53.345 --> 31:54.580
taught us
how to kill a grown man

31:54.613 --> 31:56.048
with just a sharpened pencil.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.119
Can you believe it?

32:00.152 --> 32:02.521
One swift thrust...

32:02.554 --> 32:04.023
right below the Adam's apple,

32:04.056 --> 32:06.158
and the subject
bleeds out silently.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.962
Apply enough pressure, and you
might even hit the brain stem.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.007
I've watched you die
so many times, John Dean...

32:23.676 --> 32:26.412
...in my delicious fantasies...

32:28.147 --> 32:30.282
...hanging by the neck
from a rafter...

32:31.517 --> 32:34.687
...impaled ass first
on an iron spit...

32:36.221 --> 32:38.424
...decapitated
by a lawn mower blade.

32:40.225 --> 32:44.129
You know, I'm slightly embarrassed to say,
but many a nights,

32:44.163 --> 32:46.231
the thought
of crushing you underfoot...

32:47.566 --> 32:50.636
...your organs squishing
between my toes, well, it...

32:50.669 --> 32:53.238
rocked me to sleep
like a lullaby.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.643
It helped keep me warm.

32:57.676 --> 33:02.214
But then my reverie
was disturbed.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.482
I was visited, you see.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.185
Vi-visited?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.721
Mm, haunted, you might say,

33:08.754 --> 33:10.356
by a creature...

33:12.424 --> 33:15.260
...a fat bitch rat
with buck teeth

33:15.294 --> 33:18.197
and suckled teats
that dotted her underbelly.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.567
Night after night,

33:21.600 --> 33:25.170
I could hear her in the walls,
mocking my weakness.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.642
And deep in my heart,

33:30.676 --> 33:32.244
I knew she was right.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.415
For as long as I can remember,

33:36.448 --> 33:39.685
I've wanted to purge
that weakness from my body,

33:39.718 --> 33:42.788
to destroy every inch of it.

33:47.159 --> 33:50.095
She brought me down to nothing,
that bitch rat.

33:50.129 --> 33:53.198
My spirit gave out completely.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.367
And then a miracle happened.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.738
In my darkest hour,

33:59.772 --> 34:01.807
I heard her calling me.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.809
I followed her voice

34:04.042 --> 34:05.477
into the wall.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.713
And do you know
what I did in that moment,

34:07.746 --> 34:10.516
face-to-face
with that verminous cunt

34:10.549 --> 34:12.651
that I'd been seeking
for weeks?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.457
I broke down,
weeping like a baby.

34:21.226 --> 34:25.764
But these were not tears
of joy or pain or madness.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.536
They were tears of clarity,

34:30.569 --> 34:33.439
tears of love.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.707
I realized...

34:41.380 --> 34:45.384
...that my weakness
is not something to be crushed.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.653
It's a part of me,

34:47.686 --> 34:51.123
just like you're a part of me, John.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.759
The weak and the strong,

34:53.792 --> 34:56.762
the soldier and the coward--

34:56.795 --> 34:59.465
one gives rise inexorably
to the other

34:59.498 --> 35:02.634
like a beautiful melody
through the ages.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.544
And wha-what happened
to the rat?

35:12.578 --> 35:14.446
I ate her.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.618
You ate her?

35:19.651 --> 35:22.120
First I ate her pups,

35:22.154 --> 35:23.655
and then I ate her.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.626
I ate them all.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.130
Don't you see?

35:35.534 --> 35:39.171
I ate them
so that you could live.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.763
I love you, John Dean.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.938
I love you too, Gordon.

36:17.442 --> 36:18.877
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

36:18.911 --> 36:21.480
Who the fuck put you two
in the same room?

36:21.513 --> 36:22.648
Let's go, pal.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.782
Let's go.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.977
Oh, he's so wild.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.478
My sister went to his show
in Philadelphia.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.513
Seriously?

36:54.546 --> 36:57.683
Yeah, he sang "Rebel, Rebel"
looking straight at her.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.885
She said it was like he could
see through her clothes

36:59.918 --> 37:00.986
and liked it.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.254
<i>We should sneak away</i>

37:02.287 --> 37:03.822
<i>and go see him in New Haven.</i>

37:03.855 --> 37:06.224
Hey, Marty, wanna go see
David Bowie in New Haven?

37:06.258 --> 37:07.726
Are you kidding?

37:07.759 --> 37:08.961
He's a degenerate drug addict

37:08.994 --> 37:11.630
who makes a living
singing about sex.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.398
Wow, somebody sounds
like Daddy.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.267
Shut up.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.305
Uh-oh, look who decided
to show up.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.711
Shit.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.252
Oh, oh, oh!

37:34.286 --> 37:35.320
Ooh!

37:35.354 --> 37:36.755
What's wrong with her?

37:39.725 --> 37:41.693
Hey, yeah.

37:41.727 --> 37:42.961
Almost forgot the card.

37:42.995 --> 37:45.864
I think we should go.
I don't think we should be here.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.566
Oh, there she is.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.800
Marty? Whoo.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.936
Oh!

37:53.572 --> 37:55.307
Go away.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.678
You brought a photographer?

37:59.711 --> 38:00.979
No.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.582
Well, y-yes, I did.
I said stay in the car.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.550
I told him to stay in the car.
Get in the car.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.785
What's wrong with you?

38:06.818 --> 38:08.420
Why are you even here?

38:08.453 --> 38:09.588
You wanted me to come.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.989
I didn't want you
to come like this.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.324
What?

38:12.357 --> 38:13.725
Are you stoned?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.060
You mind yourself.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.362
You can barely even stand.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.764
I hate you.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.499
You're the reason
Dad's going to jail.

38:20.532 --> 38:23.068
Oh, Dad. Oh, I see.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.070
Did he tell you that?
Is that what he's saying?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.039
- Well, you can tell him--
- I can't stand this anymore.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.707
Just get in your car and go away.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.476
I never wanna see you again.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.079
Well, maybe I never wanna
see you again.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.515
Fine. I don't care.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.750
I really don't.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.452
Dad's right.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.953
Everyone's right.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.388
You are fucking crazy.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.064
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.999
Come here.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.934
Marty, come here, baby.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.071
Oh, come on.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.639
I didn't mean it.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.774
Marty. Oh.

39:03.809 --> 39:04.976
She's so--

39:06.511 --> 39:08.547
Whoa. Okay.
Okay, let's get in the car, all right?

39:08.580 --> 39:09.715
- Okay.
- Come on.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.383
Taking you to the car.

39:11.416 --> 39:12.651
Okay. It's okay.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.453
- Oh, she's so--
- Careful, careful.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.887
Look, one more step.
One more step.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.089
- Thank you.
- There you go.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.491
- Okay. There you go.
- Oh. Thank you, Winnie.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.559
Watch your head.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.593
- I don't feel--
- Scooch.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.661
I don't feel good.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.762
You don't.
I know you don't.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.698
Okay?

39:42.481 --> 39:44.516
How's she doing?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.785
Um, she's a little out of it,

39:46.818 --> 39:47.919
but she'll be all right.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.387
Mm-hmm.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.722
About those pills
she had on her, there's--

39:50.756 --> 39:53.525
Doctor, I can't imagine
what quack in the city

39:53.558 --> 39:55.794
is still prescribing her diazepam.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.395
They ought to be sued
for malpractice.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.397
They're not
for nerves, Ms. McLendon,

39:59.431 --> 40:01.933
and they were not prescribed
by a psychiatrist.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.004
<i>Earlier today,</i>

40:06.037 --> 40:09.574
<i>we heard the beginning
of the preamble</i>

40:09.608 --> 40:12.978
of the Constitution
of the United States.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.980
Winnie, did you hear?

40:15.013 --> 40:16.982
They got the bastard cornered.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.150
But when that document...

40:18.183 --> 40:20.685
Yeah, I heard.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.687
That's great. Martha...

40:22.721 --> 40:24.990
<i>...I was not included
in that "We, the people."</i>

40:25.023 --> 40:26.625
...I talked to your doctor.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.493
Oh, isn't he cute?

40:28.527 --> 40:31.029
If only Marty
was ten years older.

40:31.062 --> 40:35.167
Yeah, he says that he called
your oncologist

40:35.200 --> 40:36.668
<i>in D.C.</i>

40:38.637 --> 40:40.939
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

40:42.073 --> 40:43.909
How do you work
this boopy thing?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.511
I wanna see my Mike Douglas.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.013
Martha...

40:55.687 --> 40:57.923
...he says it's in your blood.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.492
Probably 65% gin.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.997
How long have you known?

41:06.031 --> 41:07.499
Long enough.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.469
Well, did you tell John?

41:11.503 --> 41:13.004
I'll tell him when he calls me.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.942
Y-you already sent him
the divorce papers, right?

41:16.975 --> 41:19.978
Still hasn't signed them yet.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.983
Don't you worry about me, dear.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.887
<i>A president is impeachable</i>

41:28.920 --> 41:31.690
<i>if he attempts to subvert
the Constitution.</i>

41:32.858 --> 41:34.059
If the impeachment provision

41:34.092 --> 41:37.028
in the Constitution
of the United States

41:37.062 --> 41:41.166
will not reach the offenses
charged here,

41:41.199 --> 41:45.537
then perhaps
that 18th-century Constitution

41:45.570 --> 41:46.872
should be abandoned

41:46.905 --> 41:49.541
to a 20th-century
paper shredder.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.286
<i>By a nearly unanimous</i>

42:01.519 --> 42:03.822
<i>bipartisan vote,
the House Judiciary Committee</i>

42:03.855 --> 42:06.658
<i>has voted to adopt
three articles of impeachment</i>

42:06.691 --> 42:07.859
<i>against the president.</i>

42:07.893 --> 42:09.661
<i>The other two articles
of impeachment,</i>

42:09.694 --> 42:12.864
<i>charging the president
with illegal bombings in Cambodia</i>

42:12.898 --> 42:14.232
<i>as well as tax fraud,</i>

42:14.266 --> 42:15.934
<i>were rejected
by the committee.</i>

42:15.967 --> 42:17.769
<i>Big guy's going down.</i>

42:17.802 --> 42:19.971
Didn't even take
a poisoned cigar or nothing.

42:20.005 --> 42:22.607
Nixon? He's not going down.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.808
You really think?

42:23.842 --> 42:26.111
Yeah, you do not appoint
a brain-dead corncob

42:26.144 --> 42:28.046
like Jerry Ford your successor

42:28.079 --> 42:29.748
unless you're gonna get
something big out of it.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.250
Well, yeah, but if-if they're
starting to hand out pardons,

42:32.284 --> 42:33.919
then we should be next.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.721
It was Mitchell set
the whole thing in motion.

42:36.755 --> 42:39.257
Well, Mitchell
was just taking orders from Bob.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.793
And who the fuck do you think
I was taking orders from?

42:41.826 --> 42:43.261
Wait a minute.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.797
Are you saying that Nixon
really ordered the break-in?

42:45.830 --> 42:47.565
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.100
- Yeah.
- <i>Come on.</i>

42:49.134 --> 42:50.302
Look, I'll tell you this.

42:50.335 --> 42:53.905
Nothing went on in that place
without Dick knowing all about it.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.140
<i>Right, John?</i>

43:00.912 --> 43:02.113
Look at that billboard.

43:02.147 --> 43:03.815
What do you see?

43:05.050 --> 43:08.887
I see a wrinkled old man
I wouldn't look at twice on the street.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.290
You all seem to see
some fucking demon Svengali

43:12.324 --> 43:14.893
with swirly hypnotic eyes.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.296
Most visible billboard
on the fucking highway.

43:18.330 --> 43:20.999
He's only up there
'cause we put him there.

43:21.032 --> 43:23.034
What did we get
out of the deal?

43:23.068 --> 43:25.103
<i>Couple of rides
on</i> Air Force One.

43:25.136 --> 43:27.305
Our name
on White House stationery.

43:27.339 --> 43:30.141
I mean, shit,
don't you guys fucking get it?

43:30.175 --> 43:32.243
That old man up there
isn't Nixon.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.646
We are Nixon,

43:34.679 --> 43:35.947
all of us.

43:37.682 --> 43:40.385
And we'll still be Nixon
long after he's dead and gone.

43:47.192 --> 43:50.061
I-I didn't even get to ride
on <i>Air Force One.</i>

43:50.095 --> 43:51.296
- <i>No fooling?</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

43:51.329 --> 43:53.365
- <i>Oh, it's great.</i>
- <i>Yeah, it's terrific.</i>

43:53.398 --> 43:54.666
The-the seats swivel.

43:54.699 --> 43:55.800
You get to see a movie.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.969
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- <i>Dean.</i>

43:58.003 --> 43:59.170
You got a phone call.

44:02.340 --> 44:05.210
<i>Sometimes he let me
walk his dog.</i>

44:05.243 --> 44:07.412
<i>Oh, we all--that--
we did that first day.</i>

44:08.747 --> 44:10.081
<i>In national news,</i>

44:10.115 --> 44:12.183
<i>John Dean will be released
from prison today.</i>

44:12.217 --> 44:14.786
<i>He is the first former member
of the Nixon administration</i>

44:14.819 --> 44:17.756
<i>to be a free man
after serving only four months</i>

44:17.789 --> 44:19.024
<i>in Fort Holabird.</i>

44:19.057 --> 44:22.894
<i>Judge John Sirica granted the motion
for a reduced sentence after...</i>

44:31.269 --> 44:32.404
Hi.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.818
Wow.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.789
<i>Um...</i>

44:50.822 --> 44:52.190
<i>all right, you know what?</i>

44:52.223 --> 44:54.793
I'm gonna make you a hot toddy.

44:54.826 --> 44:57.896
Uh, I had to sell some things
to pay for the moving truck.

44:57.929 --> 45:01.399
<i>Just think, in one week,
we'll be on our way to L.A.</i>

45:04.102 --> 45:07.205
Do you hear they're sentencing
Mitchell to eight years?

45:07.238 --> 45:08.873
Surreal.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.412
Why me?

45:14.446 --> 45:15.780
<i>What was that?</i>

45:17.348 --> 45:20.485
Why me? Why--

45:20.718 --> 45:23.354
why am I the one
who gets out early?

45:23.388 --> 45:25.857
I should be in prison
right now.

45:29.327 --> 45:30.495
Hey, we knew Sirica

45:30.728 --> 45:32.230
was never gonna give you
the full five years.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.465
No, I'm not--

45:35.433 --> 45:37.836
I'm not talking
about my sentence.

45:43.074 --> 45:47.479
We destroyed something
about this country that was...

45:47.512 --> 45:49.514
so special.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.350
John, you didn't break anything
that wasn't already broken.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.253
Maybe, but...

45:58.189 --> 46:00.024
...how can you know that?

46:00.058 --> 46:04.395
Really, why am I the one
that gets the book deal, hmm?

46:04.429 --> 46:06.231
Beautiful marriage.

46:07.765 --> 46:11.236
Why am I the one
that escapes unscathed, huh?

46:18.943 --> 46:20.845
Because, John...

46:22.313 --> 46:24.516
...you are good-looking.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.971

46:47.005 --> 46:48.806
- Have a wonderful evening.
- You as well.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.842
Mitchell, party of two.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.447
Right this way.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.123
What are they all staring at?

47:05.156 --> 47:07.392
Just keep walking,
honey, chin up.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.596
Excuse me. Excuse me.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.599
That's my table.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.067
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.869
Your usual table's
already been taken.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.237
No, bullshit.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.472
You're shuffling us off
to the only table in the place

47:21.506 --> 47:25.310
where your clientele won't have
to suffer my presence.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.345
Mr. Mitchell, if you'd like
to talk to the manager,

47:27.378 --> 47:29.314
- be seated--
- No, I'd like my fucking table.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.848
That's what I'd like.

47:37.889 --> 47:39.157
Come on, honey.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.068
Here's your scotch.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.369
- Thank you much.
- You bet.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.504
- And here's your Coke.
- Thank you so much.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.006
You're welcome.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.376
Have you heard
from Mom?

47:59.444 --> 48:00.945
Just the gossip.

48:00.979 --> 48:02.614
They've got her up
at the hospital now.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.550
Well, you know your mother
with her dramatics.

48:05.583 --> 48:06.584
I'm sure she'll be fine.

48:10.088 --> 48:12.423
You don't think
you're gonna call her, do you?

48:12.457 --> 48:14.926
I'm the last person
she wants to hear from.

48:16.327 --> 48:17.895
How about you?

48:19.230 --> 48:21.232
Probably not.

48:21.266 --> 48:23.067
But I feel like maybe I should.

48:23.101 --> 48:26.571
You know, I-I hate to think
she's up there all alone.

48:26.604 --> 48:29.641
Well, I'm sure
she's not all alone, sweetie.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.010
Still.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.078
Let me tell you something

48:34.112 --> 48:36.481
about people like your mother.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.517
They mean well,

48:39.550 --> 48:44.522
but they will always destroy
their relationships

48:44.555 --> 48:47.925
with the people
that love them the most.

48:53.097 --> 48:57.268
Did you know what-what was
happening to Mom in California?

48:57.302 --> 49:00.338
I mean, did you know
while it was happening?

49:02.106 --> 49:04.676
What in the world
would give you that idea?

49:04.709 --> 49:06.177
I don't know. It's just--

49:06.210 --> 49:07.445
I mean, I was listening
through the wall,

49:07.478 --> 49:09.147
and I thought I heard
one of the bodyguards

49:09.180 --> 49:11.349
talk to you on the phone,
that's all.

49:14.552 --> 49:15.653
Um...

49:17.121 --> 49:20.625
...oh, yeah, yeah,
I remember that, um,

49:20.658 --> 49:24.595
I called to check in
on the two of you

49:24.629 --> 49:28.666
and Peter told me
that, uh, you were both fine.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.240
But then why didn't you ask
to talk to us?

49:36.274 --> 49:37.442
What's that?

49:37.475 --> 49:39.077
If you called to check
on me and Mom,

49:39.110 --> 49:41.412
then why didn't you ask
to talk to either of us?

49:43.281 --> 49:46.050
Um, I took him at his word,

49:46.084 --> 49:49.620
and, um, I had a lot of...

49:49.654 --> 49:51.089
work.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.095
All right.

49:58.162 --> 50:00.264
Can we get some, uh,
mayonnaise?

50:00.298 --> 50:01.432
<i>Sure.</i>

50:06.404 --> 50:09.340
And there was
that dreadful Chantal girl, remember?

50:09.374 --> 50:10.675
You talked to her
at the reunion.

50:10.708 --> 50:13.177
She had the crooked teeth
and the ponytails.

50:13.211 --> 50:14.645
Oh, yeah, vaguely.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.514
Her mother
was my best friend's sister,

50:16.547 --> 50:18.449
and we used to get
into her brother's car

50:18.483 --> 50:19.684
and all go up to Little Rock.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.285
I mean, it is amazing.

50:21.319 --> 50:23.121
I don't know how you still
keep all these people straight.

50:23.154 --> 50:24.522
Well, I've always had
a good memory.

50:24.555 --> 50:27.258
Good memory and good teeth,
that's what you get from me.

50:27.291 --> 50:29.660
Well, thank you for the teeth.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.162
I can still remember the song

50:31.195 --> 50:33.431
your daddy was singing
the night we met.

50:50.681 --> 50:52.250
It's like you're a child again.

50:52.283 --> 50:53.785
Well, that's the best part.

50:53.818 --> 50:56.554
Um, I promised Sharon
that I'd call her

50:56.587 --> 50:58.122
and let her know
when I'd be home.

50:58.156 --> 50:59.590
- Is-is it okay if you wait here?
- Oh, you told me that.

50:59.624 --> 51:01.426
Yes, you can go do that.
Don't leave her waiting.

51:01.459 --> 51:02.627

51:02.660 --> 51:03.761
<i>Of course.</i>

51:18.242 --> 51:20.278

<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

51:29.454 --> 51:31.589

51:31.622 --> 51:34.225

51:35.860 --> 51:38.196

51:38.229 --> 51:42.433
<i>and my family
unanimously urged me to do so.</i>

51:44.702 --> 51:47.672
But the interest of the nation
must always come before

51:47.705 --> 51:49.574
any personal considerations.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.243
From the discussions I have had

51:52.276 --> 51:53.778
with congressional
and other leaders,

51:53.811 --> 51:55.847
I have concluded...

51:55.880 --> 51:57.281
Hey, ladies.

51:57.315 --> 51:58.816
Hi.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.485
...I might not have
the support...

52:00.518 --> 52:01.719
Have you seen Martha?

52:02.753 --> 52:04.188
Got her dinner here.

52:05.423 --> 52:06.858
Jalissa, you seen Martha?

52:06.891 --> 52:10.428
Oh, yeah, she was just
down the hall that way.

52:10.461 --> 52:11.696
Thanks.

52:11.729 --> 52:14.298
Oh, quiet.
I think he's gonna say it.

52:15.399 --> 52:17.802
I have never
been a quitter.

52:19.237 --> 52:21.472
To leave office
before my term is completed

52:21.506 --> 52:24.675
is abhorrent to every instinct
in my body.

52:24.709 --> 52:28.179
<i>But as president, I must put
the interests of America first.</i>

52:28.212 --> 52:29.580

52:29.614 --> 52:32.683
<i>Therefore I shall resign the presidency,</i>
