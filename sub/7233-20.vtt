Get ready to run that fish
all the way back to Mrs.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.040
Puddleduck's.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.530
Yes!

08:55.530 --> 08:56.380
Wait.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.200
If we have the fish,
won't the cat chase us?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.190
BOTH: Exactly

09:00.190 --> 09:01.840
Now, back to
Mrs. Puddleduck's!

Run!

never run before.

Run, rabbit run.

09:14.270 --> 09:16.740
If he catches you you're
done, so run some more.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.710
Your heart is pounding.

09:21.710 --> 09:25.400
Those feet are sounding
so close to you.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.850
What can you do?

09:26.850 --> 09:28.780
Oh rabbit run.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.200
You'd better run.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.720
I think I hear him
catching up to you.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.000
Where'd the cat go?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.080
Oh no, looks like we lost her.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.170
Did you think I'd
leave my nice new home

10:07.170 --> 10:09.680
just because of a smelly fish?

10:09.680 --> 10:10.380
Ha!

10:10.380 --> 10:12.030
Rats eat cake.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.460
You know what eats fish?

10:13.460 --> 10:14.970
A cat.

10:14.970 --> 10:17.580
And you won't find
a cat around here.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.350
Oh, if there's one
thing I really,

10:19.350 --> 10:22.640
really don't like, its--

don't like cats!

10:31.240 --> 10:32.230
[LAUGHS]

10:32.230 --> 10:35.080
For a rat stuffed
full of oatcakes,

10:35.080 --> 10:37.330
Sammy can really move.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.200
Yeah, and we got Mrs.
Puddleduck's home back.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.720
Right, Benjamin?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.540
Benjamin?

10:43.540 --> 10:44.920
Phew!

10:44.920 --> 10:46.890
Lucky our carrots are safe.

In their tums.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.620
Oatcakes for everyone.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.590
Yes!

11:02.590 --> 11:04.310
Oh dear, oh dear.

11:04.310 --> 11:06.570
I hope there's
enough for everyone.

11:06.570 --> 11:09.210
It's OK, Benjamin
won't be having any.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.460
He's too full of carrots.

11:11.460 --> 11:14.100
I've always got
room for oatcakes!

11:14.100 --> 11:16.770
Especially Mrs.
Puddleduck's oatcakes.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.540
Didn't I say they were the best?

11:18.540 --> 11:20.530
[LAUGHS]

Hm, I wonder what's
happened to that awful rat.

I wouldn't worry about
him, Mrs. Puddleduck.

I think he's found
somewhere new to hang out.
