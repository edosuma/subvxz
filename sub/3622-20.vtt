08:39.286 --> 08:41.086
Boy, it's fascinating.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.387
Wow, the dictionary.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.488
Yeah, I haven't read it yet.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.056
I figure I'll wait
for the movie.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.424
You know K.P.!
Always studying.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.193
In fact, she's late
for study hall.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.562
Okay. Good luck
at the cheer-off tonight.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.031
The cheer-off?
Like this?!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.700
Sure, the crowd'll
go ape for you.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.469
Oh. Sorry.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.037
Hold it right there, you two.

08:59.039 --> 08:59.771
Why aren't you getting

08:59.773 --> 09:01.439
your photos taken?

09:01.441 --> 09:04.042
Oh. Mr. Barkin.
We were just on our way.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.378
Oh. And is this
the scenic route?

09:06.380 --> 09:09.648
Actually, Mr. B., this
<i>is</i> the scenic route...

09:09.650 --> 09:12.584
( <i>screeching</i> )

09:12.586 --> 09:14.052
Where'd Possible go?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.587
Uh... hair and makeup?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.122
Well, it couldn't hurt.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.590
Phew.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.125
Okay, Kim, coast is clear.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.159
You got... ( <i>yells</i> )

09:21.161 --> 09:23.061
Ki-Kim?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.162
Huh?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.497
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

09:25.499 --> 09:27.832
She's gone the full monkey!

09:30.703 --> 09:31.469
Huh?

09:31.471 --> 09:33.371
Okay, stay calm.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.373
( <i>screeching</i> )

09:35.375 --> 09:36.474
Ugh!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.543
( <i>yells</i> )

09:39.679 --> 09:41.379
My best friend is...

09:41.381 --> 09:42.480
my worst nightmare!

09:42.482 --> 09:44.749
( <i>beeping</i> ) Huh?

09:45.751 --> 09:48.420
Hey, Kim. I...
Oh, no!

09:48.422 --> 09:50.455
Wade! Kim's gone over
to the monkey side.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.756
Okay, don't panic.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.291
Don't panic?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.392
She's a monkey!

09:54.394 --> 09:56.461
A fur-covered tree beast!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.463
I'm working on a way
to separate Kim's genetic matter

09:58.465 --> 09:59.564
from the amulet.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.700
Wade! You're talking science.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.734
This is magic!

10:02.736 --> 10:04.436
Evil, stinking monkey magic!

10:04.438 --> 10:06.671
You can't fight magic
with science!

10:06.673 --> 10:07.572
I can, too.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.340
No, you can't.

10:08.342 --> 10:08.807
Can, too!

10:08.809 --> 10:09.608
Cannot!

10:09.610 --> 10:10.175
Can, too!

10:10.177 --> 10:10.775
Cannot!

10:10.777 --> 10:11.343
Can, too!

10:11.345 --> 10:12.110
Cannot!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.478
Can, too, infinity.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.647
Oh, he got me
with the infinity clause.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.315
I'm going to need a DNA sample.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.583
DNA?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.218
Ron, just get me
a sample of her hair.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.886
Well, plenty of that here.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.855
You heard him, K.P.
We just need some hair.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.591
Ow. Oh.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.559
My face!

10:27.561 --> 10:29.194
Oh! Ow!

10:29.196 --> 10:30.829
Would you please cooperate?

10:30.831 --> 10:32.864
( <i>screeching</i> )

10:32.866 --> 10:34.199
( <i>yells</i>)

10:34.201 --> 10:35.567
( <i>crashing</i> )

10:35.569 --> 10:36.568
( <i>grunting</i> )

10:36.570 --> 10:37.669
( <i>car alarm blaring</i> )

10:37.671 --> 10:38.803
( <i>crash</i>)

10:40.239 --> 10:43.141
( <i>chuckling</i> )

10:43.143 --> 10:44.909
So, Kim Possible...

10:44.911 --> 10:46.544
tea?

10:46.546 --> 10:49.180
How about a steaming cup
of "What's going on?"

10:49.182 --> 10:50.749
Oh, as if you don't know.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.184
All I know is
thanks to that amulet,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.919
I'm living a monkey nightmare.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.222
A nightmare?
It's my dream.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.290
You don't deserve the
power of the amulet!

10:59.292 --> 11:01.359
Yes, I'm an ungrateful monkey.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.627
Don't worry.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.596
The amulet won't be
your problem much longer.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.798
I'd like to say
it won't hurt a bit,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.667
but that wouldn't be truthful.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.305
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Bravo!

11:14.307 --> 11:15.707
A valiant effort, indeed.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.510
You didn't think I'd actually
allow you to leave?

11:18.512 --> 11:21.813
You are not a master
of Tai Ching Pek Wa, as am I.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.383
But the Monkey King amulet
has given you much.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.818
Like a tail?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.554
And now, I plan to take
what should have been mine...

11:29.556 --> 11:31.489
painfully.

11:31.491 --> 11:35.193
There.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

11:36.762 --> 11:39.631
Okay, so it was bad,
but it's for your own good, K.P.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.799
Mission accomplished.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.233
Hair sample ready to go.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.334
Place it on the sensor pad

11:43.336 --> 11:46.471
Hopefully, this will give me
the info I need.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.572
I'll make sure

11:47.574 --> 11:49.374
Kim doesn't run off.
And now we wait.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.975
Oh...

11:50.977 --> 11:52.577
What if Wade can't fix this?

11:52.579 --> 11:55.914
What happens
if Kim's like this forever?

11:55.916 --> 11:58.850
Well, if this is the new you,
so be it.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.519
There are worse things
than turning into a monkey.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.822
I can't think of any,
but I will.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.492
I don't care if
you're a stinking monkey

12:07.494 --> 12:08.526
on the outside, Kim,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.762
inside you're still
my best friend.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.964
Kim Possible, you're going
to be the best, hairiest you

12:12.966 --> 12:14.766
you can be.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.404
Okay, smile pretty
for the camera.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.906
It's an ape.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.274
Technically, she's a monkey.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.442
Apes don't have tails.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.344
Whatever.
I get paid either way.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.281
Have to admit, K.P.,
aside from the monkey thing,

12:30.283 --> 12:32.450
I bet this will be
your best school picture ever.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.587
But next time, let's not throw
stuff at the photographer, okay?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.822
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.824
Don't look, K.P.
Just walk away.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.292
( <i>giggles</i> )

12:41.294 --> 12:42.861
Oh, Josh, you are so funny.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.562
Told you not to look.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.931
I don't know what Josh could
possibly see in Bonnie over you.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.701
Except, you know, she's not full
of bananas and covered in fur.

12:49.703 --> 12:50.668
( <i>screeches</i> )

12:50.670 --> 12:51.770
But that doesn't mean

12:51.772 --> 12:52.937
you don't have feelings,
too, right?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.773
Mm-hmm.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.908
You may be a monkey,
but you're still a human being.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.777
They can't treat you
like that. Now, come on.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.612
Yo, Josh, man.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.680
I got someone here I think
you'd rather be talking to.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.915
Total rudeness.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.350
We were dishing.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.384
Bonnie, no offense,

13:06.386 --> 13:07.819
but you're way
out of your league.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.487
Excuse me?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.456
My man Josh here has had
his eye on this little lady

13:11.458 --> 13:12.457
for quite some time.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.829
Dude, are you trying
to set me up with a monkey?

13:17.831 --> 13:18.696
Uh-huh.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.865
Uh... hmm.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.468
Okay, major weirdness.
I'm out of here.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.069
See you tonight at
the cheer-off, Josh.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.639
Oh, to you, she's just a monkey.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.342
To me, she's a great friend
and a beautiful person.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.045
I'm just sorry you can't see it.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.352
( <i>Ron screams</i>)

13:52.531 --> 13:53.798
( <i>screeches</i> )

14:11.884 --> 14:13.885
( <i>screeching laughter)</i>

14:17.056 --> 14:18.756
"No pets."

14:18.758 --> 14:20.725
No offense, K.P.,
but maybe I ought to just go in

14:20.727 --> 14:22.727
and tell your mom by myself.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.995
You know,
break it to her gently.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.098
You're a... you're
a remarkable person, K.P.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.102
I mean...
never mind, I got to go.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.484
( <i>knocking on glass</i> )

14:47.753 --> 14:50.388
Sorry to bother you
at work, Mrs. Dr. P.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.056
Well, not like
I was doing brain surgery.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.057
You weren't?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.525
What's wrong?
It's Kim.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.028
Is she hurt?
No, no. She's feeling, uh...

14:57.030 --> 14:58.096
fit as a chimp.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.564
Fit as a chimp?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.165
I've never heard
that saying before.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.500
Well, you better get used to it.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.801
Kim's a monkey!

15:03.803 --> 15:05.803
Ron, you want me
to open you up?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.640
Make sure everything's,
uh, fit as a chimp?

15:08.642 --> 15:11.009
I'm serious! Look.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.146
She was just here, I swear.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.514
Okay, Ron,

15:16.516 --> 15:17.615
I've got a patient

15:17.617 --> 15:18.883
catching a chill
on his frontal lobe.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.084
But...!

15:20.086 --> 15:21.853
Mrs. Dr. P!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.657
Okay, Kim, maybe you're right.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.059
If all goes well,
she'll never have to know.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.528
( <i>grunting</i> )

15:35.067 --> 15:37.135
Any chance of you
letting me out of here?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.203
Didn't think so.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.478
( <i>grunts</i> )

15:52.051 --> 15:53.751
( <i>clanking</i> )

15:53.753 --> 15:55.853
Great!
My tail's all thumbs.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.163
Love to stay, but I don't
want to be a monkey forever.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.498
You don't know
how lucky you are.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.868
But your luck
is about to change.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.905
( <i>cackling</i> )

16:18.711 --> 16:21.245
I was destined to be
the Monkey King.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.014
According to the ancient text,

16:23.016 --> 16:24.549
there is still one way

16:24.551 --> 16:26.017
for me to achieve complete

16:26.019 --> 16:27.785
and total monkeyosity.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.021
Personally, I think you should
set your goals a little higher

16:30.023 --> 16:31.789
on the evolutionary scale.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.792
Jest if you wish,
but there is only one way

16:34.794 --> 16:37.195
to part you from the amulet.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.564
A very painful way.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.065
Hello. How are
you doing?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.500
What's with the ape?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.602
I'm a monkey.
I have a tail.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.804
Oh, yeah.
How much can you tail press?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.040
We'll see.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.509
( <i>grunts</i> )

16:51.511 --> 16:53.511
Strong tail.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.884
Doug! Stop her!

16:59.886 --> 17:02.020
I had a dog that
ran away from me once.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.222
It still hurts.
You know?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.291
Has anyone seen Kim?

17:07.293 --> 17:08.960
I mean, she is the
head cheerleader.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.695
And the cheer-off
is about to start.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.764
We won't stand a chance
without her on point.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.999
Looks like Miss Perfect's
going to leave us hanging.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.134
So typ.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.668
Don't worry, K.P.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.537
I'm sure Wade'll be able
to get you back to normal.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.671
Yo, Wade.
Status report?

17:20.673 --> 17:21.873
Wade?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.241
Sorry.
I had a printer jam.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.610
I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.145
Bad? How bad?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.981
Well, turns out
there's a 24-hour time limit.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.916
If we don't change Kim back
in five minutes,

17:31.918 --> 17:33.618
she'll be a monkey permanently.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.620
You know what, Wade?
If that's so, it's okay.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.321
I think Kim and I
have proven that our friendship

17:37.323 --> 17:38.890
isn't just skin deep,
or fur deep.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.091
Oh, Ron.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.626
That's not Kim.
What?

17:41.628 --> 17:43.995
The first sample
was from a real monkey.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.930
A natural born monkey.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.965
What?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.200
It's a monkey?!

17:49.202 --> 17:50.968
I spent the day
with a <i>real</i> monkey?

17:50.970 --> 17:51.903

17:51.905 --> 17:53.704

17:53.706 --> 17:55.073
( <i>screeching</i> )

17:55.075 --> 17:56.874
No, you're right.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.309
We had a good day, didn't we?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.145
Ron.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.847
Aah! Kim! You're a...!

18:02.849 --> 18:06.050
Yes, I know, I'm a banana-eating
tree swinger.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.820
( <i>squeals and moans</i> )

18:08.822 --> 18:12.090
Wait. How do I know you're
Kim and not a real monkey?

18:12.092 --> 18:14.058
A talking real monkey?

18:14.060 --> 18:15.326
Anything's possible.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.228
Monkey Fist tried
to get the amulet back.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.831
And, by the way,
thanks for noticing I was gone.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.834
But I thought he...
she... it was you.

18:22.836 --> 18:25.036
Please. You'd never catch me

18:25.038 --> 18:26.838
wearing that dress.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.039
( <i>retches</i> )

18:28.041 --> 18:29.974
Talk to me, Wade.
I need a DNA sample.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.375
Some hair will work.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.379
How's this?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.882
We'll know soon, because
we're running out of time.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.217
Time till what?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.052
Until you're a monkey
permanently.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.753
Can this get any worse?

18:42.755 --> 18:43.988
Yes.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.723
Hyah!

18:45.725 --> 18:47.992
Hah!

18:50.129 --> 18:52.330
( <i>groans</i> ):
Oh!

18:54.967 --> 18:56.100
Kim! Run!

18:56.102 --> 18:57.935
We'll meet up in the gym.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.137
( <i>screeches</i> )

19:04.243 --> 19:05.810
Ron Stoppable.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.013
We have both experienced
the mystical monkey power

19:09.015 --> 19:11.015
of Tai Ching Pek Wa.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.283
Oh!

19:12.285 --> 19:15.153
But I am a monkey master
and you are not.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.387
( <i>screeching</i> )

19:23.395 --> 19:26.964
Chippy, what are you doing
here with these humans?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.099
Chippy? That's your name?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.168
Uh-huh.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.170
( <i>beeps</i> ) I'm almost ready.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.905
Where's Kim?
Um, I'll find her.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.073
I'll never forget you, Chippy.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.409
Out of my way,
you monkey traitor.

19:38.411 --> 19:43.781
Now, to claim
my Monkey King crown!

19:43.783 --> 19:45.883
Welcome to
the regional cheer-off

19:45.885 --> 19:49.420
between last year's champion,
the Middleton Mad Dogs,

19:49.422 --> 19:53.157
and their arch rivals,
the Lowerton Lemurs!

19:53.159 --> 19:55.960
And there's Lowerton's mascot!

19:55.962 --> 19:57.261
( <i>crowd cheering</i> )

19:57.263 --> 20:00.898
And there's... some guy.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.066
How we doing, Wade?

20:02.068 --> 20:03.201
I'm just about ready.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
I'm going to route
the DNA sequencer

20:04.971 --> 20:06.470
through the communicator's
data port.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.406
So you just have to
point at Kim and zap.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.441
Point and zap, got you.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.144
And look! Lowerton brought
another lemur mascot!

20:13.146 --> 20:14.245
A lemur?!

20:14.247 --> 20:15.980
I've never even
been to Madagascar.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.115
Hmph. Lemur, indeed.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.418
( <i>funky dance music plays</i> )

20:26.258 --> 20:29.727
ANNOUNCER ( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Oh, this is great.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.063
The two mascots are performing
a tumbling routine

20:32.065 --> 20:34.765
and the crowd loves it.

20:41.306 --> 20:43.107
Tick-tock, Wade.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.409
All set, zap away.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.078
Huh? Wade!

20:47.080 --> 20:49.280
I'm pointing
but there's no zapping.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.249
Sorry, wrong cable connector.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.488
ANNOUNCER:
Incredible! Kim Possible,

20:57.490 --> 20:59.056
the Middleton head cheerleader,

20:59.058 --> 21:01.325
has KO'd Lowerton's mascot.

21:01.327 --> 21:04.462
It worked! No more itching.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.106
And Middleton wins
the cheer-off!

21:15.108 --> 21:16.841
Oh, what a spectacular display.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.075
My, my.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.011
Glad you could make it.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.979
So not the drama.

21:21.981 --> 21:22.913
( <i>groans</i> )

21:22.915 --> 21:24.115
That's it, buddy.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.449
You're in violation of code.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.817
Impersonating a mascot.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.252
Lemur, ha!

21:28.254 --> 21:29.920
Where's your tail, lemur?

21:29.922 --> 21:30.554
Take him away!

21:30.556 --> 21:32.890
I am a monkey master!

21:32.892 --> 21:34.558
Not a lemur!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.394
Good to have you
back, K.P.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.362
Glad to be back.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.797
Where's your little
monkey friend?

21:39.799 --> 21:40.965
( <i>gasps</i> )

21:40.967 --> 21:42.066
( <i>banging</i> )

21:42.068 --> 21:44.335
Hey, you're okay.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.304
( <i>screeching</i> )

21:46.306 --> 21:49.206
You seem to have gotten over
your monkey issues.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.808
K.P., I think
this is the beginning

21:50.810 --> 21:52.043
of a beautiful friendship.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.244
At least this year

21:53.246 --> 21:55.079
I avoided another
picture day disaster.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.115
Thank goodness I wasn't
anywhere near a camera.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.451
Uh, yeah. About that...

22:00.453 --> 22:01.919
<i>Mom!</i>

22:01.921 --> 22:04.355
What is that picture doing
on the wall?

22:04.357 --> 22:05.323
What's that, honey?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.224
Oh, well,
the boys just loved it.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.093
It's your best
school picture yet.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.394
Hoo-sha!

22:10.396 --> 22:13.230
Very funny, tweebs.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.498
Well, you have to admit, Kimmy,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.100
the Nana dress isn't your look

22:16.102 --> 22:17.601
but Chippy pulls it off.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.570
( <i>gasps, groans</i> )
