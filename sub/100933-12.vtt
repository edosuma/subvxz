00:01.120 --> 00:03.750
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

00:03.750 --> 00:04.960
And every outcome where
we don't come out on top

00:04.960 --> 00:06.580
has one thing in common.

00:06.580 --> 00:07.580
Fitz.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.830
And now you're gonna
take us to him.

00:08.830 --> 00:10.540
Daisy: Sibyl dropped Kora
in my lap

00:10.540 --> 00:12.210
because they knew
I'd want to save her.

00:12.210 --> 00:15.000
The thing is, I already
have a sister to save.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.250
Her name is
Jemma Simmons.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.420
Where are you?!

00:17.420 --> 00:18.750
I don't want to forget you.

00:18.750 --> 00:19.750
Please.
It's gonna be okay.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.460
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.500
I'm guessing from his attitude
that he didn't find Fitz.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.290
Fitz?

00:25.290 --> 00:27.250
Who's Fitz?

00:27.250 --> 00:30.330
Your mother died
protecting Daisy from him.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.120
Nathaniel:
To all Chronicom vessels,

00:33.120 --> 00:34.750
you may fire
whenever you want.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.170
They're doing it.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.330
They're destroying
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.620
Sousa:
Are those space lasers?

00:59.620 --> 01:01.710
Daisy: Just lasers
that happen to be in space.

01:01.710 --> 01:02.880
But they're weapons,
right?

01:02.880 --> 01:04.460
100%.

01:04.460 --> 01:06.620
But they don't seem
to be aimed at us,

01:06.620 --> 01:08.460
which means they probably
don't see us yet.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.120
Hope that's still true
after I do this.

01:11.790 --> 01:13.210
Alright, we got
less than a minute

01:13.210 --> 01:15.170
before we dock
with the Zephyr...

01:15.170 --> 01:16.960
or the other thing's
gonna happen.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.670
Let's say we manage
to dock with the Zephyr

01:18.670 --> 01:20.380
and somehow rescue
Simmons and Deke.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.790
Then what?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.210
One problem at a time.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.460
Here we go.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.880
Three...

01:27.880 --> 01:29.330
two...

01:29.330 --> 01:30.580
one.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.830
Nice flying, Tremors.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.330
I thought it was "Quake."

01:54.080 --> 01:56.580
What was that?
Are we hit?

01:56.580 --> 01:58.000
No.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.710
I think they've locked on
to the Zephyr.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.170
So...

02:38.170 --> 02:40.500
I guess this is
the next problem.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.620
Is it possible
they're on the other side,

02:57.620 --> 02:59.500
doing the exact
same thing?

03:56.250 --> 03:59.500
Let's scan their ship,
see if we can find our team.

04:14.540 --> 04:17.790
This is your last chance
to give up Fitz's location.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.960
The Chronicoms
won't be so --

04:18.960 --> 04:20.040
Amateurish?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.120
Pedestrian?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.330
Ham-fisted?

04:23.330 --> 04:26.040
Sibyl:
We have a more precise method
of retrieving information.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.880
Aah!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.830
Hey!

04:41.620 --> 04:44.040
Well, look at you.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.250
I was gonna say
"in the flesh,"

04:48.250 --> 04:52.000
but I suspect it's more like
a space-age polymer...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.330
or something.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.080
Either way,
it's super-impressive.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.830
Everything is.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.290
And what a triumph.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.210
All S.H.I.E.L.D. targets
destroyed.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.960
Except for
the Lighthouse.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.620
Straight to the point.

05:05.620 --> 05:06.960
I like that.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.170
You've been inside.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.710
You know that
the Lighthouse was built

05:09.710 --> 05:12.250
to withstand
any external attack.

05:12.250 --> 05:15.620
Which is why we're taking
a different approach.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.420
None of it matters
if Leopold Fitz is alive.

05:18.420 --> 05:22.540
As long as he lives,
our future isn't secure.

05:22.540 --> 05:25.210
Jemma Simmons has effectively
erased him from her memory.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.380
In fact,
based on what I saw,

05:27.380 --> 05:29.580
there's a good chance
he isn't even alive.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.540
I'm not leaving it
to chance.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.000
The injection I gave her
will dissolve her implant.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.750
We'll learn whether she's truly
forgotten Leopold Fitz...

05:37.750 --> 05:40.670
or whether it's simply
masking the truth.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.830
It looks like
every S.H.I.E.L.D. base is gone.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.620
Even the Triskelion.

05:47.620 --> 05:48.960
Are you okay?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.290
I will be.

05:52.290 --> 05:55.830
It's just...a lot.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.540
You can feel
all those lives lost?

06:00.580 --> 06:03.040
Why weren't we attacked?
Sibyl knows where we are.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.210
She's smart.

06:04.210 --> 06:05.790
She knows
the Lighthouse would survive

06:05.790 --> 06:06.880
a conventional assault.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
She must have other plans.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.540
Where's that
coming from?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.830
What are the Chronicoms
doing now?

06:16.830 --> 06:18.670
I can't stop it.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.670
Why don't you two
implement lockdown protocols

06:20.670 --> 06:22.210
while I figure this out.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.250
Why didn't you tell me you were
working with the Chronicoms?

06:34.250 --> 06:35.790
I'm not working
with the Chronicoms.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.960
They're working for me --
for us.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.540
It's part of my plan.

06:39.540 --> 06:42.080
Was killing my mom
a part of your plan, as well?

06:43.830 --> 06:45.920
I saw her body.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.210
I know it was you.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.710
I did that for you.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.790
To protect you.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.080
I didn't ask for that.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.330
Because you're
a good person.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.710
You don't see
the evil in others.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.750
If you'd only heard
some of the things she said --

07:00.750 --> 07:02.380
that you were a mistake,

07:02.380 --> 07:05.210
that she was sad
you were even born,

07:05.210 --> 07:07.620
how you needed
to be put down.

07:07.620 --> 07:10.170
Jiaying was never interested
in being your mother.

07:10.170 --> 07:13.170
She only wanted
to control you.

07:13.170 --> 07:16.330
She resented you.

07:16.330 --> 07:19.500
But I'm here
to set you free.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.250
To show you
how powerful you can be.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.620
It was terrible,

07:28.620 --> 07:31.500
seeing her on a table
like that.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.830
I know.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.170
I'm making sure
her body is buried

07:36.170 --> 07:38.580
and that everyone
who tried to hurt you

07:38.580 --> 07:39.620
will be buried with her.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.670
Breaker, breaker one-nine.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.540
This is the Big Bad Wolf.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.170
I'm in the henhouse.

07:52.170 --> 07:54.330
Time to fry some chicken.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.710
I have a tingle right here.

08:16.710 --> 08:17.830
It's probably
the implant.

08:19.710 --> 08:23.420
The bio-implant
that blocks your memories --

08:23.420 --> 08:24.460
of you-know-who.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.540
Of Fitz.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.080
I know that name.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.500
Yes. You do.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.000
Um, I --

08:37.000 --> 08:38.790
Maybe this will help,
okay?

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
Uh...

08:43.420 --> 08:44.620
Um, uh...

08:45.830 --> 08:47.330
I'm the man you love.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.830
Uh, uh --
We're a team.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.170
You're bio, I'm tech.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.380
My name is --

08:51.380 --> 08:53.120
James Bond.
'Kay. No.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.460
But that's not
entirely...surprising.

08:55.460 --> 08:56.500
Never mind.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.710
Um...I don't know.
Maybe --

08:58.710 --> 09:01.210
Maybe the thing that
they injected you with
is doing something.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.580
Maybe it's destroying
the implant

09:02.580 --> 09:04.580
or it's scrambling your thoughts
and your memories

09:04.580 --> 09:05.790
and your synapses
all together.

09:05.790 --> 09:07.380
Why would they do that?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.880
Because they think
that you have a secret.

09:10.670 --> 09:12.710
I do have a secret.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.040
I can feel it.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.290
It's in there,
and everything's --

09:18.580 --> 09:19.960
...swirling.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.670
Maybe that's their plan.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.120
They're gonna
pour everything out

09:26.120 --> 09:28.670
until they find
what they need.

09:28.670 --> 09:31.620
It's okay. I got you.
Just rest.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.620
Mack: That's a lot
of Chronicoms.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.250
We just have to find...

09:45.670 --> 09:46.750
There.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.620
Now, you see
how those two are warmer?

09:48.620 --> 09:50.710
I'm pretty sure
that's Simmons and Deke.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.420
What about that one --
there?

09:54.460 --> 09:55.380
Kora.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.750
How'd she get up here?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.380
I don't care.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.670
She's not gonna stop me
from getting back Simmons.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.540
And Deke.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.710
Sure.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.330
So, how are we
gonna do this?

10:07.330 --> 10:08.620
Well, they don't know
we're here,

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
so I'll infiltrate the ship
and I'll bring them back.

10:11.540 --> 10:12.620
Okay.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.880
I'll figure out a way
to get the hangar doors open.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.670
Seems they're
our only way out.

10:19.670 --> 10:21.080
I can help with that.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.500
Great.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.920
I'll be back.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.040
Daisy.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.540
Yeah?

10:42.080 --> 10:44.040
Didn't know
I was gonna do that.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.210
I'm glad you did.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.080
Um...I'll see you
when I get back.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.040
Yeah.
Okay.

10:58.790 --> 10:59.790
Impressive.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.580
Thank you.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.290
Turns out I speak fax.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.540
This isn't fax.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.750
Garrett's here.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.750
Yo-Yo: That's down
on the lowest level.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.790
Well, we knew
they'd be coming for us.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.170
Zoom in on that.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.420
I'll say it
if no one else will.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.000
That's a Chronibomb.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.290
Enough of those strategically
placed around the base,

11:27.290 --> 11:29.460
he'll be able to flatten
the entire Lighthouse.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.040
Any progress on that gadget
to contain him?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
Yeah.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.290
Mack gave us
a hard drive.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.460
It has specs of a device

11:34.460 --> 11:36.580
that trapped Gordon
in our old timeline.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.960
I remember that room.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.290
It cost you a hand.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.880
Seemed like a big deal
at the time.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.920
Now look at me.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.460
Fitz built these panels.

11:44.460 --> 11:47.120
They prevented Gordon
from teleporting out.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.380
I'm working on something
that might replicate that trick.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.250
I'll need your help
to pull it off.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.710
I hope
it involves punching.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.880
Sibyl:
Did you really think you could
sneak onto one of my ships?

12:12.080 --> 12:15.330
Well, you gotta admit,
you didn't see that coming.

12:15.330 --> 12:19.670
I'll grant that your appearance
is a statistical improbability.

12:19.670 --> 12:23.380
But whatever advantage you
hoped to gain is irrelevant.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.750
I didn't see you coming
because it is meaningless.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.620
You're too late.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.830
Every S.H.I.E.L.D. base
has been destroyed.

12:29.830 --> 12:32.170
The war is over.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.620
And you've lost.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.120
Let's just
kill them now.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.210
My team can finish them
in no time.

12:41.210 --> 12:43.210
You know nothing
of time.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.290
Take care of the humans
on their ship.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.880
Do not interfere
with Daisy Johnson.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.620
I don't like this idea.

12:54.620 --> 12:58.830
I need confirmation
that Leopold Fitz is dead.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.080
The odds of discovering
the truth about him

13:03.080 --> 13:04.670
are 11% higher

13:04.670 --> 13:09.210
if we allow Daisy Johnson
to reunite with Jemma Simmons.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.500
Be patient.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.880
It can't be true.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.540
I'm sure it's not.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.670
We didn't come this far
to fail.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.080
Not like this.
Not to a bunch of --

13:25.080 --> 13:26.670
Robots.

13:29.790 --> 13:32.710
She has to be lying.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.170
Lighthouse can survive
anything.

13:34.170 --> 13:36.920
We just need to get
back down to it, regroup.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.500
It's too late for that.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.460
We owe Daisy, Simmons, and Deke
a way out of here

13:40.460 --> 13:41.670
when they get back.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.290
Yeah.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.380
We do owe them that.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.000
There's no reason
to be quiet anymore.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.670
Let's make some noise.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.620
Let's blow those hangar doors
to pieces.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.460
What else do we have?

14:13.460 --> 14:15.920
Kora: I was surprised
that my sister is here.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.330
Never underestimate
the power of hate.

14:19.330 --> 14:20.960
You heard
how she threatened us?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.580
Is she really
that powerful?

14:22.580 --> 14:25.120
In the other timeline,
she quaked the world apart.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.500
There is no end
to her hate,

14:26.500 --> 14:28.670
to what she's willing
to destroy.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.580
But you know
who's more powerful than her?

14:34.580 --> 14:35.620
Us.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.830
That's right.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.330
S.H.I.E.L.D. are
the bad guys.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.790
It's why
we're destroying them.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.120
But after they're gone,

14:43.120 --> 14:46.170
we'll be able
to take over the planet.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.040
There'll be chaos
and anarchy,

14:48.040 --> 14:51.040
and then you and I are
gonna come save the day.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.120
'Cause we're the good guys.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.040
There's only one person
who could ruin that.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.830
Daisy.
That's right.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.920
She's very bad.

15:00.920 --> 15:05.080
I don't care what Sibyl says
about percentages or waiting.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.460
We need
to finish Daisy off.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.710
Now.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.750
That's pretty specific.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.460
Hmm.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.830
It's based on the schematics
Fitz designed.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.210
I think it'll work.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.710
I'm still getting used to
the idea of you as a techie.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.750
I'm still getting used to
the idea of me as just "tech."

15:33.330 --> 15:34.710
You really believe that?

15:36.380 --> 15:39.290
No. Not really.

15:39.290 --> 15:42.000
Still...figuring it out.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.580
Me too.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.460
We're not
the same people we were.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.380
Pretty sure
everyone would agree on that.

15:52.380 --> 15:56.080
I'm wondering if we change
the timelines or...

15:56.080 --> 15:57.920
if they change us.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.580
The Melinda May I know

15:59.580 --> 16:03.000
would never ask
these philosophical questions.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.080
Which is the point.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.580
How did I become
this me?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
I don't know.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.290
But I like this you.

16:16.290 --> 16:19.000
And if
I'm completely honest...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.170
I like this me, as well.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.290
Well, hey, buddy.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.210
What's with the "X"?

16:32.210 --> 16:34.380
Based on the structural
integrity of the Lighthouse,

16:34.380 --> 16:36.290
I determined you'd appear
right about there

16:36.290 --> 16:37.710
to plant
one of your bombs.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.580
And did you think
I was gonna just teleport

16:39.580 --> 16:41.170
straight into those?

16:41.170 --> 16:42.460
No, I thought
it'd be way cooler

16:42.460 --> 16:44.330
to have them
teleported onto you.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.620
Well, that would be
a neat trick.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.880
Well...I'd love
to stay and chat,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.960
but there's some very impressive
explosives about to blow,

16:53.960 --> 16:55.960
so ta-ta.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.330
That hurt.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.580
Tell us
how to deactivate these.

17:12.580 --> 17:15.080
I can't.
Not from here.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.330
I didn't think
I'd need to.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.750
How many bombs total?

17:19.750 --> 17:21.420
An even dozen.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.880
Gonna pancake
this whole puppy.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.170
Unless you want to get pancaked
with us, call it off.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.420
Thought you'd be back
by now.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.290
Those bombs are gonna blow
in a minute or two.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.710
Funny story.
That's what I'm calling about.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.170
I'm gonna need you
to deactivate those bad boys.

17:42.170 --> 17:45.750
Wow. You know, I'd love to,
but that's not what the plan is.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.290
The plan is for you
to demolish the Lighthouse.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.750
100%. Totally on board
with that.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.170
I just need a little more
time -- 10 minutes tops.

17:55.170 --> 17:57.920
Otherwise, if this baby blows,
I'm gonna blow.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.880
Then I'm gonna
take this opportunity,

17:59.880 --> 18:01.120
in case
I don't see you again,

18:01.120 --> 18:03.170
to thank you
for your service.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.290
Son of a bitch.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.420
There's no time
to get to the surface.

18:21.290 --> 18:22.670
May?!

18:22.670 --> 18:23.880
Coulson?!

18:25.540 --> 18:27.790
Hello?!

18:27.790 --> 18:30.670
Coulson:
I need a hand -- over here.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.580
Help me with May.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.920
Can you stand?

18:54.380 --> 18:55.710
Yeah.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.420
Thanks.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.960
I moved all the bombs
to one place,

19:08.960 --> 19:11.420
hoping the whole structure
wouldn't collapse.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.580
What about Garrett?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.040
We need to stop
the bleeding.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.540
Do we?

19:36.790 --> 19:39.170
He's our best chance
to help our friends in space.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.040
When I asked
if you had something else,

19:44.040 --> 19:47.120
I meant something...
bigger and more powerful.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.920
Well, I don't see you coming up
with any brilliant ideas.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.080
Wish I could disagree.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.620
Hey, look, for a guy who was
ripped from his own timeline,

19:54.620 --> 19:56.620
who ended up
on a spaceship full of robots,

19:56.620 --> 19:58.380
you're not doing half bad.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.330
Follow my lead.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.540
We are here
to take your faces.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.710
Oh.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.170
Lord knows
you could do a lot better

20:10.170 --> 20:11.830
than the ones
you're wearing now.

20:11.830 --> 20:14.080
I'm pretty sure
they don't understand sarcasm.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.830
They'll understand this.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.460
If that wasn't
egg in your beer.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.620
How many more of those
do you have?

20:38.620 --> 20:40.000
That's it.

20:43.420 --> 20:45.380
We just have to
hold them off long enough

20:45.380 --> 20:47.420
for Daisy to get back
with Simmons and Deke.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.210
And then?

20:50.880 --> 20:52.830
One problem at a time.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.210
That's not creepy...

21:19.210 --> 21:20.960
He should make it.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.420
Don't sound so thrilled.

21:23.670 --> 21:24.670
Yo-Yo.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.750
What happened?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.580
It was dark.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.920
Speared myself
with a piece of rebar.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.330
And there's
a lot of rebar.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.500
As far as I can see,
we're trapped down here.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.620
All the exits are blocked
under a ton of rubble.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.790
Son of a bitch.

21:46.790 --> 21:49.250
Have a little respect for
the people who saved your ass.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.830
I meant
Nathaniel Malick.

21:51.830 --> 21:53.620
Bastard left me here
to die.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.080
What ever happened
to team loyalty?

22:01.710 --> 22:04.960
I was shown a future where
S.H.I.E.L.D. abandoned me.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.210
How come it's playing out
the exact opposite?

22:07.210 --> 22:09.290
Malick showed you
an old timeline.

22:09.290 --> 22:10.620
This one's different.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.710
Nothing's written.

22:12.710 --> 22:15.000
It's not too late to be
on the right side of history.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.500
Looks like I'm wearing
a white hat from now on.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.540
Hey.

22:24.540 --> 22:25.580
Buddy?

22:25.580 --> 22:27.960
Interesting.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.960
I'm hearing a pattern
in the sounds.

22:39.830 --> 22:40.830
Hi.

22:40.830 --> 22:41.790
Daisy.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.620
Oh, finally.
Ohh.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.420
Okay.
We have to go.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.210
Jemma.

22:48.330 --> 22:49.540
What's going on?

22:49.540 --> 22:50.960
They injected her
with something.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.580
It's blurring
her memories.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.540
I think the Chronicoms are
trying to get intel on Bobo.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.290
This is Daisy.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.120
She's gonna help us
get out of here, okay?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.120
She doesn't even
remember me?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.500
It comes and goes.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.080
She was talking about stars
a minute ago,

23:04.080 --> 23:06.790
and then she went off on
cuttlefish and chromatophores.

23:06.790 --> 23:09.080
Jemma, we-- we're gonna
get you somewhere safe,

23:09.080 --> 23:10.420
but we have to go, okay?

23:10.420 --> 23:12.500
Why are you wearing
that costume?

23:12.500 --> 23:15.250
It's --
It's not a costume.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.750
It's for protection.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.420
Can I have one?

23:18.420 --> 23:19.580
U-Uh...

23:21.500 --> 23:22.620
Yes.
Yes.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.540
Come on. Follow me,
and you will get one.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.830
Wait. How did you
get in here?

23:33.830 --> 23:36.210
It's the weirdest thing.
Nobody tried to stop me.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.000
It was like they wanted me
to find Simmons.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.750
And me.
Sure.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.710
Is this the future or the past?
They look so similar.

23:42.710 --> 23:44.080
Is this a secret time?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.420
Yes, yes. Everything
has to be kept secret.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.170
It's so hard,
trying to remember

23:48.170 --> 23:50.120
what's a secret
and what's not.

23:52.620 --> 23:56.120
The device in Jemma Simmons'
brain has been dissolved.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.000
She has no protection.

24:01.210 --> 24:02.250
Where is Kora?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.170
Resting.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.960
What if Simmons doesn't
tell us what we need?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.960
She will have no choice.
The truth will pour out.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.670
We will learn
whether or not Fitz is alive,

24:11.670 --> 24:13.880
and if he is...

24:13.880 --> 24:15.960
we will have
his location.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.380
And the rest
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

24:17.380 --> 24:18.920
Their ship is trapped.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.830
They lack the firepower
to defend themselves,

24:20.830 --> 24:23.170
let alone escape.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.210
We will do with them
as you wish.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.380
Deke reconfigured
these shells

24:44.380 --> 24:46.170
with an electrical
disruption charge.

24:46.170 --> 24:48.290
A single shot
should drop a Chronicom.

24:48.290 --> 24:49.330
Great.

24:49.330 --> 24:50.710
How many shells
do we have?

24:50.710 --> 24:52.000
Maybe 50.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.790
50?

24:53.790 --> 24:55.210
Wow.
That's real peachy.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.330
Did you just say
"peachy"?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.580
Yeah.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.920
Oh, geez.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.620
When we get out of here,
I gotta get you some new words.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.960
And don't let Daisy
hear you talking like that.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.120
Why? Does it mean
something bad now?

25:09.460 --> 25:10.790
No, it's --

25:11.830 --> 25:13.880
Never mind.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.790
It's a fine word.

25:15.790 --> 25:17.460
And you're a fine man.

25:19.460 --> 25:22.210
I just can't believe
it's gonna be...

25:22.210 --> 25:24.250
robots that take us out
in the end.

25:25.210 --> 25:27.040
If this really is
the end,

25:27.040 --> 25:29.830
shouldn't we take out
as many of them as possible?

25:29.830 --> 25:31.580
Even more than 50?

25:34.330 --> 25:35.790
Back at Area 51,

25:35.790 --> 25:38.290
the Chronicoms tried to
turn Helius into a nuclear bomb

25:38.290 --> 25:40.210
using just one
of their robots.

25:44.580 --> 25:47.830
What kind of damage could we do
with these six?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.500
A helluva lot.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.040
You're right --
definitely weird.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.750
I keep forgetting --
where are we going?

26:05.750 --> 26:06.960
Home.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
Home.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.330
I have a home.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.540
And I'm married.

26:10.540 --> 26:12.080
I remember
being married.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.710
Is that a secret?

26:13.710 --> 26:15.920
Who did I marry?

26:15.920 --> 26:18.170
I can smell his hair,
but I can't see his face.

26:18.170 --> 26:19.210
We'll talk about this
later.

26:19.210 --> 26:20.620
But isn't this later?

26:20.620 --> 26:23.540
It's about being married,
joining together, join --

26:23.540 --> 26:27.210
I can do it,
even if I don't know why.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.620
Here it comes.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.540
Marriage is the key.

26:34.540 --> 26:36.380
Heart in hand --
and singing.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.080
Can a key sing?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.120
After we're joined,
we're unstoppable.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.460
But I'm afraid
we stopped.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.790
Oh, God.

26:43.790 --> 26:45.420
Okay, Simmons, let's just --
let's just keep going, okay?

26:45.420 --> 26:46.580
We're almost there.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.250
What have you done?

26:54.250 --> 26:55.620
What are you
talking about?

26:55.620 --> 26:57.120
Kora.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.580
She's going to ruin it.

27:03.670 --> 27:05.710
Hello, sister.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.500
Kora, we don't
have to do this --

27:13.500 --> 27:14.620
not here.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.880
Let's get off this ship
and talk.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.540
You knew our mom was dead,
but you didn't tell me.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.380
That was a mistake.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.790
I was trying
to protect you.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.710
I don't need protection!

27:32.330 --> 27:33.880
Get Simmons
back to the Zephyr.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.210
Don't wait for me.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.040
Go.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.210
See?

27:39.210 --> 27:41.420
I can take care
of myself.

27:41.420 --> 27:43.120
Having a power
is not the same thing

27:43.120 --> 27:44.580
as taking care
of yourself.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.040
You sound like Mom.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.500
I wouldn't know.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.880
She was a monster.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.960
You don't believe that.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.920
Don't...tell me
what I believe.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.080
Okay.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.420
Then I'll tell you
what I believe.

28:01.420 --> 28:03.710
I believe that Jiaying loved you
more than anything.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.420
But she didn't know
how to help you.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.460
She was afraid of me.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.170
She was afraid for you.

28:10.170 --> 28:12.670
Twisting words again.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.420
I'm not gonna use my power
to fight you.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.500
Then you're going to die.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.380
That's your call to make.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.000
Look...

28:26.000 --> 28:29.580
I didn't have a sister
in my timeline.

28:29.580 --> 28:32.960
I didn't even know I had a mom
until it was too late.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.620
You're better off
without one.

28:34.620 --> 28:37.170
No. I wasn't.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.620
And the only reason
she had me

28:38.620 --> 28:41.750
was out of love
and grief over losing you.

28:42.790 --> 28:44.420
Come with me.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.670
It's too late.

28:46.670 --> 28:48.040
S.H.I.E.L.D. is destroyed.

28:50.290 --> 28:51.670
We've won.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.540
Nathaniel and I
are gonna rule over everyone.

28:55.540 --> 28:56.920
Is that what you want?

28:58.210 --> 29:00.460
Or is that what he wants?

29:00.460 --> 29:03.500
We can still change
this timeline.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.960
Will you help me?

29:07.750 --> 29:09.670
Coulson: It's an 0-8-4.

29:09.670 --> 29:12.210
Well, technically,
it's the location of an 0-8-4.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.460
So, the message came
from S.H.I.E.L.D.,
not the Chronicoms.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.170
What's an 0-8-4?

29:16.170 --> 29:18.380
An object
of unknown origin.

29:18.380 --> 29:21.380
Could be a person,
an energy source, a weapon.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.420
Whatever it is,
it's dangerous.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.670
It could be a trap.

29:24.670 --> 29:27.080
Can't be much worse
than being trapped in here.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.000
Hey.

29:29.580 --> 29:31.170
I can get us out.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.920
Just slip these bracelets
off me,

29:32.920 --> 29:34.790
and I'll be
your teleporting taxi.

29:34.790 --> 29:37.170
No way.
Hell no.

29:37.170 --> 29:39.330
New timeline,
new John Garrett.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.920
That just makes it worse.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.710
I don't think
we have any other options.

29:58.620 --> 29:59.710
Okay.

30:04.250 --> 30:06.380
Now, this is wired
to the Gravitonium Drive,

30:06.380 --> 30:08.460
as well as
the Time Jump Drive.

30:08.460 --> 30:10.210
It's gonna make
a helluva boom.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.750
Deke. Jemma.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.830
Where's Daisy?

30:19.830 --> 30:21.380
Dealing with Kora.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.330
She said not to wait.

30:23.330 --> 30:25.540
I know this place.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.420
Home.

30:27.420 --> 30:28.920
Yeah,
we're not there yet.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.500
They did something
to her.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.880
She's remembering and forgetting
at the same time.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.750
We can't let the Chronicoms
have her. The --

30:38.000 --> 30:40.330
So,
what's the plan now?

30:40.330 --> 30:42.330
Is it something that doesn't
involve a suicide bomb?

30:42.330 --> 30:44.960
Because this looks
a lot like a suicide bomb.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.710
This was in case
Daisy didn't find you guys.

30:46.710 --> 30:47.880
I'll go for Daisy.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.040
Stand down, Agent Sousa.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.210
And do what?

30:53.380 --> 30:55.000
Find me some duct tape.

30:56.790 --> 30:59.380
You are responsible
for this.

30:59.380 --> 31:02.330
Simmons was about to give us
the location of Leopold Fitz,

31:02.330 --> 31:04.540
but now
the moment has passed.

31:06.380 --> 31:08.330
Where are they?

31:09.920 --> 31:11.790
I don't think
Daisy's bad.

31:11.790 --> 31:14.790
She -- She said things,
and...

31:14.790 --> 31:17.080
and they --
they made sense.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.210
I couldn't.

31:22.290 --> 31:23.330
I'm sorry.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.040
You don't think
Daisy's bad?

31:29.380 --> 31:30.420
No.

31:30.420 --> 31:31.500
Okay.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.250
Well...

31:33.250 --> 31:35.880
We'll just have to agree
to disagree.

31:38.170 --> 31:41.750
Kimball, you interested
in a promotion?

31:41.750 --> 31:43.080
Absolutely.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.580
Then lock her up
in a cell.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.330
Looks like we got to consult
your Time Stream again.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.880
I told you guys
not to wait.

31:54.880 --> 31:55.960
Yeah.
You're welcome.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.210
What's the plan?

31:57.210 --> 31:58.420
Mack and Sousa
figured it out.

31:58.420 --> 31:59.830
I'm still a little fuzzy,
but apparently,

31:59.830 --> 32:02.080
it involves
a lot of duct tape.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.670
Deke: Daisy's on board.
It's go time.

32:04.670 --> 32:06.250
Do I sound cool
when I say that?

32:28.880 --> 32:30.210
That one right there.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.120
Lord,
I hope this works.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.670
Man: Freeze!
Hands in the air, or we'll --

33:34.540 --> 33:38.000
Hands behind your head
before another person gets shot.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.460
I can disarm everyone

33:42.460 --> 33:44.120
without them even knowing
what happened.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.210
Let's not scare them any more
than they already are.

33:47.210 --> 33:48.710
They are scared.
I can feel it.

33:48.710 --> 33:50.250
And confused.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.000
My name is Phil Coulson.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.880
I'm an agent
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.250
We received a coded transmission
after the attack.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.080
Is it fair to assume
that everyone here

34:02.080 --> 34:04.000
responded to
the same coded broadcast?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.210
I'm Agent Brandon Gamble.

34:11.210 --> 34:13.000
I was stationed
at the Hub.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.580
Why the hell
didn't you just use the door,

34:16.580 --> 34:20.250
instead of this crazy
teleportation device?

34:20.250 --> 34:22.420
Your friend
might still be alive.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.460
Does that mean
I just killed one of our own?

34:26.580 --> 34:28.120
Oh, God.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.330
I know
what you're feeling,

34:30.330 --> 34:33.540
but this man, John Garrett,
was a double agent.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.880
He was responsible
for destroying the Lighthouse

34:35.880 --> 34:37.290
and killing civilians.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.620
You did the world
a favor.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.670
You have a package?

34:41.670 --> 34:44.620
A box, a briefcase, something
you were told to bring?

34:49.790 --> 34:52.080
Any idea what we're
supposed to do with these?

34:56.580 --> 34:57.500
0-8-4s.

34:59.420 --> 35:00.620
Where did they
come from?

35:02.290 --> 35:05.380
That one belonged
to my grandfather, who was SSR.

35:05.380 --> 35:07.960
Been in my family
for decades.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.420
I was raised
to guard it with my life.

35:10.420 --> 35:11.960
If and when
the signal ever came,

35:11.960 --> 35:13.750
I was to deliver it
as instructed.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.000
What's inside?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.290
Never looked.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.790
Wasn't part of the order.

35:19.790 --> 35:22.290
This one has
a postmark of 1948.

35:22.290 --> 35:24.250
Agent Grace Mulcahey,
ma'am.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.330
That box has been locked in
a safe in my parents' basement

35:26.330 --> 35:27.710
since before I was born.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.000
Same instructions
as Agent Gamble --

35:30.000 --> 35:31.460
protect at all costs.

35:34.290 --> 35:36.580
Well...

35:36.580 --> 35:38.960
maybe we should see
what the hubbub's all about.

35:43.710 --> 35:46.920
This seems to have been
manufactured in the '60s.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.250
And this...

35:49.250 --> 35:51.420
never seen
anything like this.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.040
Any thoughts?

35:58.790 --> 35:59.880
They're with us!

36:07.380 --> 36:09.000
I knew you'd be back.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.210
That makes one of us.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.790
I'll be fine.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.790
Hey.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.790
Oh.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.750
Sorry.
Not sure what happened.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.960
No, it's good.
Just...new.

36:36.670 --> 36:38.170
What happened?

36:38.170 --> 36:41.120
You recognize
any of these people?

36:43.040 --> 36:45.210
The Chronicoms did something
to her memory.

36:45.210 --> 36:47.000
She's forgotten
all of us --

36:47.000 --> 36:49.670
names, faces, everything.

36:49.670 --> 36:51.670
Then she'll just go off
on something from the past

36:51.670 --> 36:53.040
or being married or --

36:53.040 --> 36:54.710
Math is
my faithful husband.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.000
Like that.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.540
Sousa: Any idea
why we're all here?

37:00.540 --> 37:03.380
Or...who sent that message?

37:03.380 --> 37:05.420
That's an 0-8-4
in and of itself.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.380
We can't stay here
too long.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.920
The Chronicoms are coming,
and they seem to be planning

37:09.920 --> 37:11.960
some sort of landing
or invasion.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.750
So we need to be ready
for the next move.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.830
I was hoping the 0-8-4s
might be just that.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.580
Maybe they are.

37:23.620 --> 37:24.750
What are you doing?

37:25.710 --> 37:27.580
Holy matrimony.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.080
How do you know
how to do this?

37:41.080 --> 37:43.380
I just know
they need to be married.

37:43.380 --> 37:45.170
Two becomes one.

37:45.170 --> 37:46.500
Then three becomes one.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.500
Why do I know this?

38:00.080 --> 38:01.750
We're missing something.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.120
Man: Sorry I'm late!

38:10.830 --> 38:13.210
Damn bus broke down.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.250
Where did you get this?

38:17.250 --> 38:19.210
I don't remember exactly.

38:19.210 --> 38:21.080
Maybe from my friend Enoch

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
or, uh,
one of the Koenigs.

38:24.290 --> 38:25.330
Thank you.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.040
Coulson,
what's happening?

38:30.040 --> 38:32.380
It's possible

38:32.380 --> 38:35.830
Enoch deposited these
over the decades.

38:35.830 --> 38:37.580
Okay, but why?

38:37.580 --> 38:39.540
May: It might be a weapon
to fight the Chronicoms.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.880
A singing key.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.000
So...
what's in there?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.080
The end
or the beginning.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.120
I can't remember.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.620
I don't know if it's supposed to
explode or save us,

39:37.620 --> 39:39.620
but I have to admit --

39:39.620 --> 39:41.620
kinda disappointed.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.170
There's got to be
something else.

39:44.170 --> 39:45.880
Jemma, I know
that somewhere inside

39:45.880 --> 39:47.250
that you understand this.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.460
Just think, okay?
You --

39:49.460 --> 39:51.540
You knew how to
put the pieces together.

39:51.540 --> 39:53.580
You knew
about the singing key.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.670
You kept -- You kept saying
that you were married.

39:55.670 --> 39:58.040
"I now pronounce you..."

39:58.040 --> 39:59.960
You said those words.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.170
I did.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.620
You were all there.

40:07.620 --> 40:09.750
We were.

40:09.750 --> 40:11.830
I was married.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.120
I am married.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.750
I have proof.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.500
Why can't I remember
whom I married?

41:08.460 --> 41:09.710
Jemma.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.380
Coulson: Fitz.

41:13.380 --> 41:14.880
You did it.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.710
Hey! It worked!

41:15.710 --> 41:18.170
No, stop -- stop that.

41:19.540 --> 41:21.120
She doesn't remember me,
does she?

41:27.540 --> 41:28.540
Damn.

41:35.170 --> 41:37.330
Can you tell
where Daisy Johnson went?

41:37.330 --> 41:39.830
There's a new
statistical anomaly --

41:39.830 --> 41:43.420
a massive power drain
in New York City.

41:43.420 --> 41:46.790
S.H.I.E.L.D. has a safe house
in New York.

41:46.790 --> 41:48.040
It's not in any files.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.460
It wasn't targeted
by your lasers.

41:49.460 --> 41:51.330
They've probably gone there
to regroup.

41:52.750 --> 41:54.880
Assign me some Hunters,

41:54.880 --> 41:56.830
and I will personally
finish off S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:56.830 --> 41:58.580
before we begin
the invasion.

41:58.580 --> 42:01.830
There is less than a 22% chance
of you succeeding.

42:04.830 --> 42:08.710
Here's something
much more interesting.

42:08.710 --> 42:12.330
There's a 100% chance
that this is the last time

42:12.330 --> 42:14.880
the S.H.I.E.L.D. team
will ever be together.

42:17.170 --> 42:19.210
The end is at hand.
