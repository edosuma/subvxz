in their sheets?

19:14.970 --> 19:18.177
Fuck that. I can't even count
the number of stains in mine.

19:18.178 --> 19:19.678
You sleep at that lady's place?

19:19.679 --> 19:22.469
Yup. She's got a Jacuzzi tub
in the master bedroom.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.928
Think I might be in love.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.803
Whatever you do,
don't marry her.

19:25.804 --> 19:28.010
Fifty percent of all marriages
end in divorce.

19:28.011 --> 19:29.427
Straight ones, anyway.

19:29.428 --> 19:30.678
No data on the gay ones,

19:30.679 --> 19:32.511
but gotta be in the ballpark.

marriage stats?

19:34.011 --> 19:35.344

19:35.345 --> 19:36.844

Sounds like you're scared.

19:43.929 --> 19:44.887
Of what?

19:44.888 --> 19:46.344
You love him, right?

19:46.345 --> 19:47.844
- Yeah.
- Then marry him.

19:47.845 --> 19:48.886
Make him happy.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.302
If you gotta get a divorce,
do it.

19:50.303 --> 19:51.427
Then you'll move on.

19:51.428 --> 19:53.761
But at least you'll be happy
for a while.

19:53.762 --> 19:56.803

Any later than that,
I get the GERD something nasty.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.469
So if you could, uh,
get your maid lady

28:02.470 --> 28:04.761
to cook us up something for
around then, that'd be swell.

28:04.762 --> 28:06.219
We have sex
whenever I feel like it.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.344
Obviously, I'll be the top,

28:07.345 --> 28:08.844
since you're...
pretty much a chick.

28:08.845 --> 28:10.219
But you are gonna have
to stick something up my ass

28:10.220 --> 28:12.887
every once in a while,
or I'm gonna get real bitchy.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.678
This does not fall under the
scope of Nurse V's Jiffy Care.

28:17.679 --> 28:19.594
She's
a 15-year-old Missouri girl

28:19.595 --> 28:21.010
who's ten weeks pregnant,

28:21.011 --> 28:23.678
and some old white assholes
decided she can't terminate

28:23.679 --> 28:25.678
her pregnancy in her state
after eight weeks.

28:25.679 --> 28:26.969
What's she supposed to do,

28:26.970 --> 28:29.719
risk her life in some
back-alley abortion?

28:29.720 --> 28:30.886
We'll take her to the clinic.

28:30.887 --> 28:33.135
How much are one of those,
Dr. Brenda?

28:33.136 --> 28:36.886
Without insurance,
it'll run at least $400.

28:36.887 --> 28:38.469
That's not that much.

28:38.470 --> 28:40.969
They're on the SNAP program.
They can barely afford to eat.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.552
What about one
of those free clinics?

28:42.553 --> 28:44.469
Clinics won't touch
an out-of-state patient,

28:44.470 --> 28:46.886
free or not.

28:46.887 --> 28:49.511
There's always
a medical abortion.

28:49.512 --> 28:50.761
Mifepristone.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.678
Two pills taken
over a couple of days.

28:52.679 --> 28:54.094
Great, let's point 'em
to Rite Aid

28:54.095 --> 28:55.095
and send them on their way.

28:55.096 --> 28:56.344
Uh, how much does that cost?

28:56.345 --> 28:57.427
About the same.

28:57.428 --> 28:59.678
But I could always write
the prescription

28:59.679 --> 29:01.719
in Veronica's name.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.260
I mean, with insurance,
it's only a $20 copay.

29:04.261 --> 29:06.260
- You have insurance?
- Obamacare.

29:06.261 --> 29:07.427
So great, on top of all this,

29:07.428 --> 29:09.052
we're running
an insurance scam now?

29:09.053 --> 29:10.219
She's 15.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.344
Having a baby this young
could ruin her life.

29:12.345 --> 29:14.594
We started V's Jiffy Care
to do some good.

29:14.595 --> 29:16.302
At least it's the lesser
of two evils.

29:16.303 --> 29:18.969

Uh-huh. Sure do.

You need an abortion?

I told Murray the pullout method

37:39.512 --> 37:41.427
was an ineffective form
of birth control,

37:41.428 --> 37:44.969

to Mickey?

43:09.261 --> 43:10.929

43:51.053 --> 43:53.470

either, Lip.

43:54.637 --> 43:56.803
I want him back.

43:56.804 --> 43:58.302
So get him back.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.512
But I think I'm gonna have
to marry him to do it.

44:09.345 --> 44:11.261
I think you should marry him.

44:12.387 --> 44:13.845

44:15.679 --> 44:16.844

But first,

45:17.303 --> 45:18.594
you've already proven
that you're tough.

This an engagement ring?

No. No.

47:39.553 --> 47:42.970
It's a... it's a promise ring.

47:44.220 --> 47:45.886
You're kidding me.

47:45.887 --> 47:47.010
No.

47:47.011 --> 47:48.470
I have one too.
See?

47:49.136 --> 47:50.427
Sweet.

47:50.428 --> 47:52.886
All right, look.

47:52.887 --> 47:56.344
Gallaghers and marriage,
they don't mix well.

47:56.345 --> 47:58.220
But a Gallagher
keeps his promise.

a piece of paper from the state

48:01.970 --> 48:03.470
to say that I'm committed?

48:04.970 --> 48:06.470
I'm committed.

48:13.053 --> 48:15.386
Nah. I'm good.

48:15.387 --> 48:16.552
- Mick. Mickey.
- No.

48:16.553 --> 48:19.052

48:19.053 --> 48:21.302
What are you, a teenage girl?

48:21.303 --> 48:23.260
You're not even wearing yours.
You got it around your neck.

48:23.261 --> 48:25.386
You can just tuck it in there
and no one even has to see it.

48:25.387 --> 48:26.427
It doesn't matter
where you wear it.

48:26.428 --> 48:29.427
It-it-it symbolizes commitment.

48:29.428 --> 48:30.969
I'm not saying never.

48:30.970 --> 48:33.512
No, just saying you don't
love me enough now.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.761
And that's fine.
It's cool.

48:36.762 --> 48:38.552
- I got Barry.
- Byron.

48:38.553 --> 48:41.928
He answers to whatever the fuck
I call him, all right?

48:41.929 --> 48:43.553
'Cause that's true love.

48:47.679 --> 48:49.512
How do you know you love me?

48:50.595 --> 48:52.261
Huh?

48:53.804 --> 48:55.553
How do you really know?

48:58.136 --> 49:00.302
I'm bipolar, right?

49:00.303 --> 49:02.469
I don't know who I am
from one day to the next.

49:02.470 --> 49:03.886
I can't guarantee shit.

49:03.887 --> 49:07.469
So why do you wanna spend
the rest of your life with me?

49:07.470 --> 49:09.303
Are you fucking crazy?

49:10.679 --> 49:12.135
And who else have you dated?

49:12.136 --> 49:13.761
- I've dated plenty of people...
- No, no, no, no, no.

49:13.762 --> 49:15.970
Not fucked, dated,
been in love with.

49:18.011 --> 49:19.969
How can you
possibly know that me,

49:19.970 --> 49:23.594
that-that this, all of me,
all the fucking versions I am,

49:23.595 --> 49:25.094
how do you know that
that's what you wanna spend

49:25.095 --> 49:26.804
the rest of your life with?

49:28.220 --> 49:30.303
Jesus Christ, Ian.

49:31.804 --> 49:34.344
I've always known Gallaghers
were fucked up,

49:34.345 --> 49:37.469
but I have never been happier
to be a Milkovich.

49:37.470 --> 49:39.427
When you get over this whole

49:39.428 --> 49:40.844
"I'm not worthy of love"
bullshit,

49:40.845 --> 49:42.552
why don't you give me a call?

49:42.553 --> 49:44.678
Maybe if Barry hasn't made
an honest woman out of me,

49:44.679 --> 49:46.679
I'll still be around.
