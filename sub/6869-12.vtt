WEBVTT

00:02.496 --> 00:04.758
Hurry,
hurry, sit down, come in!

00:04.760 --> 00:07.089
I have the most fantastic news!

00:07.091 --> 00:08.751
What, did
Bub finally die?

00:08.871 --> 00:10.025
Who's Bub?

00:10.027 --> 00:12.493
My mother, and before
you make some snotty comment,

00:12.495 --> 00:15.658
yes I have a mother, do you
want to hear my news or not?!

00:15.660 --> 00:18.258
Yeah, if you're done
yelling at me for no reason.

00:18.260 --> 00:23.194
Last night, an Air Force B-52
bomber crashed off the coast of Bermuda!

00:23.196 --> 00:26.250
Well it's
about frickin time!

00:26.488 --> 00:29.634
What, we're we not bombing them in
advance of an amphibious invasion?

00:29.636 --> 00:30.934
Why would we invade.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.067
Bermuda.

00:32.069 --> 00:35.468
Ah, Bermuda. I
was thinking Bahamas.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.302
Same question.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.171
Same answer, Why not? It's
how we got the Virgin Islands.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.741
Actually, the United States
bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.043
- Okay, Mr. Peabody...
- Are you finished?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.177
Yes.

00:46.179 --> 00:47.848
Good. Because the B-52 was -

00:47.968 --> 00:50.547
In the middle of
the Bermuda Triangle, is this

00:50.549 --> 00:53.282
about the Bermuda Triangle, because
that's my fourth biggest fear!

00:53.284 --> 00:56.017
It's about
the B-52's payload!

00:56.019 --> 00:57.685
Namely, a Mark-28

00:57.687 --> 00:59.052
hydrogen bomb.

00:59.054 --> 01:00.520
Ohhhh!

01:00.522 --> 01:03.088
Which ISIS...
is going to recover.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.188
What!?

01:04.190 --> 01:08.624
And then give to the U.S.
government in exchange for a huge reward!

01:08.626 --> 01:11.026
So, ransom it back.

01:11.028 --> 01:16.463
No, not ransom it, Cyril, we're-
look, semantics, whatever, this is -

01:16.465 --> 01:17.063
Treason?

01:17.065 --> 01:19.665
A huge
opportunity for ISIS!

01:19.667 --> 01:25.705
- Or the Russians...- The B-52 is
on the ocean floor here, at a depth

01:25.707 --> 01:27.174
of eight thousand feet...

01:27.176 --> 01:28.509
or thirteen hundred

01:28.511 --> 01:29.643
thirty-three fathoms.

01:29.645 --> 01:30.844
How do you know that?

01:30.846 --> 01:31.612
How do you not?

01:31.614 --> 01:34.714
So recovering the bomb
requires a deep submergence

01:34.716 --> 01:39.486
vehicle. The only American DSV is here,
in the Pacific. The Russians have

01:39.488 --> 01:42.989
one in the North Atlantic, so if
they hear about the wreck and start

01:42.991 --> 01:46.860
- steaming toward it-
- They don't actually steam anymore, Mother.

01:46.862 --> 01:50.029
It's a figure of speech,
like "shut your hatch,"

01:50.031 --> 01:54.635
because my point was, the Russians will
beat them to it. So we are going to

01:54.637 --> 01:57.037
beat the Russians.

01:57.039 --> 01:59.273
Give it up, folks!

01:59.275 --> 02:01.007
Mike Eruzione!

02:01.009 --> 02:05.244
LANA; Well - shut up - since
Krieger doesn't have a

02:05.246 --> 02:10.282
- submersible hidden in his lab...
- Or do I?

02:10.283 --> 02:12.317
I don't, actually.

02:12.319 --> 02:15.519
Then how are we supposed to
beat anybody to a hydrogen bomb, under

02:15.521 --> 02:17.987
two-point-two-seven
leagues of water?!

02:17.989 --> 02:21.222
Oh my Jesus
God damn alright already!

02:21.224 --> 02:22.623
Can I
possibly help you?

02:22.625 --> 02:25.191
Please, I know
you were talking loud so

02:25.193 --> 02:27.793
I'd hear you, so whatever, but
we're not speaking so if you

02:27.795 --> 02:32.764
want a deep submergence whatever you can
talk to my stupid gross brother Cecil!

02:32.766 --> 02:35.032
Who, by the way, is
here to see you.

02:35.034 --> 02:36.934
Ms. Archer will see you now.

02:36.936 --> 02:39.168
Thank you, Cheryl, I-
Rrraaaghh!

02:39.170 --> 02:41.837
I hate you!

02:41.839 --> 02:43.773
Hello, I'm Cecil Tunt.

02:43.775 --> 02:46.175
I believe you're in need
of some assistance?

02:46.877 --> 02:50.712
Yeah, RienPoortvliet just called,
he wants you to pose for him.

02:50.714 --> 02:54.081
C'mon, beloved
illustrator of "Gnomes"?

02:54.083 --> 02:56.883
Jesus, read a
coffee table book!

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:31.663 --> 03:35.187
Wow, you own an
island, an undersea laboratory,

03:35.307 --> 03:38.074
and this... choppersaurus?

03:38.076 --> 03:40.410
Guess it doesn't suck to
be a billionaire, huh?

03:40.412 --> 03:42.512
Probably not, but
Cheryl and I split our

03:42.514 --> 03:46.150
parents' estate, so technically I'm
only worth five hundred million.

03:46.152 --> 03:48.619
Which also doesn't
suck, obviously.

03:48.621 --> 03:51.155
Unlike you
who totally sucks obviously!

03:51.157 --> 03:52.890
Will you shut up?!

03:52.892 --> 03:57.461
I swear to God, if you get us kicked
off before I get my jumbo scrimps on -

03:57.463 --> 03:59.997
You'll wish you were
Michael Findlay.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.632
A, Cecil won't
kick you off, he wants

04:01.634 --> 04:04.101
everybody here, for no good reason--
He doesn't need one,

04:04.103 --> 04:07.705
he's an American hero. Who's
going to make me rich.

04:07.707 --> 04:09.606
And B, that's
not even real shrimp.

04:09.608 --> 04:11.008
This is all vegan-soy-bullshit.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.042
Pffrrfft! Prrfft! Puh!

04:12.044 --> 04:14.077
Because he's
totally vegan, because his

04:14.079 --> 04:17.613
stupid gross girlfriend Tiffy's a
vegan, and a... brother-stealer!

04:17.616 --> 04:20.084
Who can also
totally heeearyoooou...

04:20.086 --> 04:22.119
Which is amazing
because why aren't you dead

04:22.120 --> 04:23.187
from protein deficiency?!

04:23.189 --> 04:25.890
Uh, because I get all
eight essential amino acids

04:25.892 --> 04:30.194
from amaranth and quinoa without
murdering helpless animals?

04:30.196 --> 04:30.928
Oooooh!

04:30.930 --> 04:31.829
kkkuughh!

04:31.831 --> 04:33.298
Hey, Tiff?

04:33.300 --> 04:36.968
Could you, instead of antagonizing
her, maybe go ahead and take off?

04:36.970 --> 04:40.506
Love yoooou.

04:40.508 --> 04:44.043
We'll rendezvous with my research vessel
in a few hours, so in the meantime,

04:44.045 --> 04:47.880
I guess, continue to make such
wildly liberal use of the bar.

04:47.882 --> 04:52.384
Done! You're okay, Cecil. I
don't get why Cheryl hates you so much.

04:52.386 --> 04:52.918
Right?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.021
I mean, you've got
this whole Jacques Cousteau-

04:55.023 --> 04:58.291
- thing going on, that's-
- Just one of many philanthropies. I have so

04:58.293 --> 04:59.826
much on my plate, as it were.

04:59.828 --> 05:03.898
Children Without Plates, speaking of
plates, uh, Doctors Within Borders...

05:03.900 --> 05:04.999
Within borders.

05:05.001 --> 05:06.834
Well, of countries
ravaged by war.

05:06.836 --> 05:09.937
Right, otherwise-
Otherwise there's not really much point.

05:09.939 --> 05:14.842
Then there's Nourish A Child, Shoe
A Child, Bespectacle A Child,

05:14.844 --> 05:18.612
- umm, One Laptop Per Child Soldier...
- Wait, what?

05:18.614 --> 05:22.283
Which, unfortunately, soon became
One Thousand Laptops Per Warlord.

05:22.285 --> 05:24.785
Man, all those charities
have gotta cost, like -

05:24.787 --> 05:26.921
Hey! I should
go help Tiffy.

05:26.923 --> 05:32.293
Since we're flying into the Bermuda Triangle...
where mysteries abound!

05:32.295 --> 05:33.995
What kind of mysteries?

05:33.997 --> 05:37.265
I'm kidding!

05:37.267 --> 05:39.467
Well Cheryl,
you come by it honest.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.369
- Speaking of...
- Aagh! Lana c'mon,

05:41.371 --> 05:43.171
we're about to fly into the
Bermuda Triangle, my nerves

05:43.173 --> 05:44.673
are frayed enough as it is.

05:44.675 --> 05:45.540
Really.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.976
No, Long Island Iced
Tea number three really took

05:47.978 --> 05:48.977
the edge off. Want one?

05:48.979 --> 05:53.848
No, I'm not drinking, but-
Oh my God! I totally saw this coming!

05:53.850 --> 05:54.816
You saw what coming?

05:54.818 --> 05:56.885
Did you not join
the Nation of Islam?

05:56.887 --> 05:57.919
No, Archer, I -

05:57.921 --> 05:58.687
You know they won't

05:58.689 --> 05:59.655
let you keep dating Cyril,

05:59.657 --> 06:00.989
right? Plus no bacon?

06:00.991 --> 06:02.624
You done?

06:02.626 --> 06:05.694
Well for now, but after I take a nap-
You'll wake up just in

06:05.696 --> 06:08.597
time to get shot for treason, because
your mother wants to ransom a hydrogen

06:08.599 --> 06:10.332
bomb back to the United
States government.

06:10.334 --> 06:14.837
It's a reward! And maritime
salvage law is very clear on the subject.

06:14.839 --> 06:16.605
According to Cecil.

06:16.607 --> 06:17.974
And what's he
getting out of this?

06:17.976 --> 06:21.477
I... guess whatever useless
thing philanthropists normally get from

06:21.479 --> 06:23.380
squandering their
money on the poor.

06:23.382 --> 06:27.317
So what, he's conducting a huge
naval operation just for a warm fuzzy?

06:27.319 --> 06:29.319
I -- hey, wait a second!

06:29.321 --> 06:30.220
What?

06:30.222 --> 06:33.023
I think I have
room for a fuzzy navel.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.059
Wow Tiffy,
who taught you how to fly?

06:36.061 --> 06:38.828
Was it that goose you freed,
ruining last year's Christmas

06:38.830 --> 06:42.432
dinner, or --
Rrrgh, Cecil, I swear to Goddess...?

06:42.434 --> 06:46.103
I know, Tiffy, but please, try
to focus on the greater good. In the

06:46.105 --> 06:48.939
words of the immortal Jeremy Bentham-
Good thing I'm

06:48.941 --> 06:52.009
immortal, cause if she says one
more word to me I will slam

06:52.011 --> 06:55.045
this helicopter into
the frickin ocean.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.882
Well, you seem busy.

06:58.884 --> 07:04.120
So say it's worth two billion,
a fair reward on that would be...

07:04.122 --> 07:05.488
um, hello!

07:05.490 --> 07:08.491
Oh, Mr. Tunt! Please,
join me, you're just the person

07:08.493 --> 07:11.528
- I want to talk to...
- And I you. About my

07:11.530 --> 07:14.498
sister. I was curious if
you'd noticed anything...

07:14.500 --> 07:16.667
well, curious, about
her behavior.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.602
Ha! Ha! Ha!

07:18.604 --> 07:19.969
Oh, you're serious.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.638
I'm afraid so, yes.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.807
Well how much
time do you have?

07:23.809 --> 07:31.081
- As much as you need...
- Oh my God, I

07:31.083 --> 07:35.451
don't know what to say... I have
figuratively lost my tongue.

07:35.453 --> 07:37.854
With Brent it
was almost literally.

07:37.856 --> 07:39.622
That's why we can't
have scissors.

07:39.624 --> 07:42.925
I had no idea her mental state
had declined to such an extent. I mean,

07:42.927 --> 07:47.063
- the arson's not surprising...
- What have you done?

07:47.065 --> 07:47.897
Ha haha!

07:47.899 --> 07:49.732
Take that, gazebo!

07:49.734 --> 07:52.002
But you're
telling me she had...

07:52.004 --> 07:54.905
Mm! Choke-sex,
that's her kink!

07:54.907 --> 07:58.877
With a KGB cyborg. After she led him
straight to the ISIS safehouse,

07:58.879 --> 08:01.680
at 921 East
Seventy-Third Street.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.449
Oh my -- wait,
is that classified?

08:04.451 --> 08:07.853
- I won't tell if you won't tell...
- Mmmkay! Well, I

08:07.855 --> 08:11.957
appreciate your candor in this matter, Ms. Archer-
Oh no, it's Ms.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.081
Oh.

08:13.201 --> 08:18.086
Ms., yes, thank
you for, um... yes.

08:27.359 --> 08:29.594
Come on, you
call this fully stocked?

08:29.596 --> 08:32.330
And no Georgia peaches?
What the--?

08:32.332 --> 08:33.231
What're you doing?

08:33.232 --> 08:35.131
I --
what're you doing?!

08:35.134 --> 08:38.102
Hairy navel. Started
as a fuzzy, but I'm calling

08:38.104 --> 08:42.873
this vacation, so... Okay.

08:42.875 --> 08:45.109
Love our little talks!

08:45.111 --> 08:46.677
Rrowrf. Nom nom nomnomnom.

08:46.679 --> 08:48.379
Hi, it's Pam, right?

08:48.381 --> 08:51.215
Enjoying the cruelty-free
vegan seafood buffet?

08:51.217 --> 08:54.885
Mrmff, it's pretty good, once you
get over how allergic I am to soy.

08:54.887 --> 08:56.454
What?! Oh my
God, don't eat that!

08:56.456 --> 08:58.890
Wh-? Hey! I am
a consenting adult.

08:58.892 --> 09:03.695
Plus I assume you've got an epi-pen
on this big Riptide-lookin' bastard?

09:03.697 --> 09:07.131
I -- yes, in the first
aid kit in the cockpit, but -

09:07.133 --> 09:08.900
Well then shut up.

09:08.902 --> 09:15.173
Shutting up, yes. But before I do, could I...
ask you a few questions?

09:15.175 --> 09:17.841
How is everybody
okay with this?

09:17.843 --> 09:18.675
How are you not?

09:18.677 --> 09:19.376
Lana, you heard Ms.

09:19.378 --> 09:21.378
Archer, it's either us
or the Russians, and -

09:21.380 --> 09:24.214
I did not hear that, actually, but-
But if you found

09:24.216 --> 09:26.984
somebody's wallet, you'd
expect to get a reward, so -

09:26.986 --> 09:28.552
What if they
won't pay a reward?

09:28.554 --> 09:30.120
Then what, she just
keeps the bomb?

09:30.122 --> 09:31.488
C'mon, it's not
gonna come to that.

09:31.490 --> 09:33.624
Ooh, but if it does
we could move to Cecil's island

09:33.626 --> 09:35.058
and be a rogue state!

09:35.060 --> 09:37.661
- Coool...
- Ugh, forget it.

09:37.663 --> 09:42.165
Oh, and also dummies? We're five
hundred miles from the nearest tree.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.835
Hey thanks, Magellan!

09:44.837 --> 09:47.538
Hey wait, why the heck are you
painting my face like this?!

09:47.540 --> 09:49.073
Cause you look fierce.

09:49.075 --> 09:50.074
Rrowr.

09:50.076 --> 09:51.209
Rrowrf.

09:51.211 --> 09:53.077
Well thank you, Pam,
I appreciate your candor,

09:53.079 --> 09:57.215
and -- you really, really should
really stop eating those.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.583
Last one.

09:58.585 --> 10:02.119
Mmrowmf.

10:02.121 --> 10:05.155
Malory, please, is there any way
I can get you to reconsider this?

10:05.157 --> 10:08.925
- Well, if you feel that strongly...
- I so do.

10:08.927 --> 10:12.662
Cecil says marine salvage goes
for ten to twenty percent of the item's

10:12.664 --> 10:16.600
value, but since all I'm asking is a
measly three percent, if you've got

10:16.602 --> 10:19.302
sixty million dollars
lying around...?

10:19.304 --> 10:20.303
Bwexqueeze me?!

10:20.305 --> 10:21.604
I know, right?

10:21.606 --> 10:23.506
It's a steal at twice the price.

10:23.508 --> 10:27.111
Yeah and about that, Cyril
figured out how big our bonuses should be.

10:27.113 --> 10:28.212
Your what?!

10:28.214 --> 10:29.380
I -- Ray made me!

10:29.382 --> 10:31.783
Cyril! C'mon
you're fierce, rrowr!

10:31.785 --> 10:34.319
Rrraarrgh!

10:34.321 --> 10:36.654
No! Don't!

10:37.557 --> 10:39.090
Uh, could I speak
to you for a moment?

10:39.092 --> 10:40.525
"Wildly liberal use,"

10:40.527 --> 10:43.261
Cecil, those were
your exact words!

10:43.263 --> 10:46.698
No, of course, that's totally fine,
but I wanted to talk to you about -

10:46.700 --> 10:49.167
Don't say high-
functioning alcoholism.

10:49.169 --> 10:51.202
I wasn't. Going to.

10:51.204 --> 10:52.269
Well then
what's on your mind?

10:52.271 --> 10:55.873
- Well, it's about my sister...
- Hey whoa! I dunno what

10:55.875 --> 10:59.343
she told you but Carol's a consenting adult, so-
Well that's actually

10:59.345 --> 11:01.711
kind of my point, I wanted
to ask if you'd ever

11:01.713 --> 11:09.052
seen my sister acting strangely, or-
Ha! Oh, you're serious.

11:13.192 --> 11:18.128
Just ignore
it, it's non-diegetic.

11:18.130 --> 11:20.631
Last one,
stinky-pinky-swear.

11:20.633 --> 11:21.865
Mrowf.

11:21.867 --> 11:22.866
Psst! Pam!

11:22.868 --> 11:24.969
Aw crap, already?

11:24.971 --> 11:25.636
Pam!

11:25.638 --> 11:29.673
Look, auditory hallucinations aren't
gonna make you any less delicious.

11:29.675 --> 11:32.109
Hey! I was talking to that!

11:32.111 --> 11:33.377
Shhh! Shut up!
I need your help!

11:33.379 --> 11:34.612
And that's how you ask?

11:34.614 --> 11:36.280
Cecil's like,
interviewing everybody!

11:36.282 --> 11:38.849
Yeah, he -- is he?
Doing that?

11:38.851 --> 11:40.151
Yes! And I
think he's taping it!

11:40.153 --> 11:41.986
Look, there's
cameras everywhere!

11:41.988 --> 11:43.187
Huh.

11:43.189 --> 11:44.755
I think he's
taping them saying I'm crazy

11:44.757 --> 11:47.825
so he can show it to a judge and
get a conservatorship over me!

11:47.827 --> 11:49.493
Huh.

11:49.495 --> 11:50.860
"Huh" what?!

11:50.862 --> 11:54.864
I mean... ya think that's
the worst idea anybody ever had?

11:54.866 --> 11:56.366
Oh. My God.

11:56.368 --> 11:58.635
I know, it's hard to hear, but-

11:58.637 --> 11:59.369
Owww!

11:59.371 --> 12:00.537
I thought
you were my friend!

12:00.539 --> 12:04.742
Yeah and for like six months you
also thought you were a werewolf!

12:04.744 --> 12:08.045
Aw crap, I can't feel my face.

12:08.047 --> 12:13.452
Last one, swear to God.

12:13.454 --> 12:17.957
Swear to God, every full moon
she'd make us lock her in the ISIS vault.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.491
Oh my God, how
are you laughing?

12:19.493 --> 12:22.027
That's not funny, it's tragic!

12:22.029 --> 12:26.665
I -- no yeah, but you
know, plus time, it equals -

12:26.667 --> 12:28.601
Thank you, I've
heard quite enough.

12:28.603 --> 12:32.838
Now if you'll please excuse me, I-
Cecil? My darling whom I love?

12:32.840 --> 12:35.107
And also strangers
whom I don't even like?

12:35.109 --> 12:37.109
Our ETA is fifteen minutes.

12:37.111 --> 12:42.181
And the seas are really choppy, so
we may be in for a rough landing.

12:42.183 --> 12:45.051
Thank you love yoooooou.

12:45.053 --> 12:48.521
So you may want to
switch to coffee.

12:48.523 --> 12:51.158
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ahhh.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.093
Oh, you're still serious.

12:54.095 --> 12:57.530
Or am I?

12:57.532 --> 12:59.566
I am, actually.

12:59.568 --> 13:01.768
Have you people
lost your minds?!

13:01.770 --> 13:04.671
- 'cause apparently it's going around...
- Because - shut up - if

13:04.673 --> 13:09.676
we recover the bomb, I will decide if
any of you receives a tiny bonus, so -

13:09.678 --> 13:10.778
If?! If?!

13:10.780 --> 13:12.312
Guys, shut up,
I got this, shut up.

13:12.314 --> 13:13.614
What do you mean, if?!

13:13.616 --> 13:15.016
Also, what are we talking about?

13:15.018 --> 13:19.854
Nothing. There's nothing to talk
about, because I am -- Jesus Christ!

13:19.856 --> 13:22.190
Okay, it's either
the altitude or a stroke.

13:22.192 --> 13:25.294
Mother, it's Sterling!
Do you smell toast?

13:25.296 --> 13:26.095
Pam?!

13:26.097 --> 13:30.700
Grrrgh, grrrgh!

13:30.702 --> 13:33.336
What the-
-- hell are you doing?!

13:33.338 --> 13:35.572
The cockpit is off
limits, missy!

13:35.574 --> 13:38.742
Oh yeah?!
Well so's my inheritance!

13:39.611 --> 13:42.612
Goddammit, shut
up John Williams!

13:42.614 --> 13:45.148
Oh my God you
really are crazy!

13:45.150 --> 13:47.116
Would a crazy person do this?!

13:47.118 --> 13:48.518
Ungh!

13:48.520 --> 13:51.887
Yes!

13:51.889 --> 13:53.522
What the
hell's going on?!

13:53.524 --> 13:55.458
It's Cheryl!
She's in the cockpit!

13:55.460 --> 13:57.994
I think she's trying
to kill us all!

13:57.996 --> 13:59.095
ARCHER Oh good.

13:59.097 --> 14:02.650
For a second there I
thought I drank too much.

14:11.239 --> 14:14.107
Cheryl!
Cheryl, open the door!

14:14.109 --> 14:17.811
Rrrr! Rrrk! Why the
hell's there a lock on it?!

14:17.813 --> 14:20.113
Well obviously to
prevent this exact scenario

14:20.115 --> 14:22.983
from ever happening, but-
Now?! Really?! You think this is a

14:22.985 --> 14:23.984
good time to be facetious?!

14:23.986 --> 14:26.318
I'm -- fairly certain you're
not using "facetious" correctlrrmp.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.649
Cheryl? Can you come out here so
we can talk about this like adults?

14:29.651 --> 14:32.018
Who aren't gonna die
in a helicopter crash?

14:32.020 --> 14:34.688
We'll crash with the tapes!
Of all of you stupid

14:34.690 --> 14:37.424
jerks saying I'm crazy!

14:37.426 --> 14:38.125
The what?

14:38.761 --> 14:40.794
The tapes!
It's part of his sneaky

14:40.796 --> 14:45.399
plan to get a conservatorship over
me so he can steal my inheritance!

14:45.401 --> 14:47.434
That's why she
hijacked his helicopter?

14:47.436 --> 14:49.903
Man, talk about rich
people problems.

14:49.905 --> 14:52.607
- Grrrgh...
- What're you -- Archer, Pam is dying!

14:52.609 --> 14:54.576
Cyril shut up!
I'm in charge here!

14:54.578 --> 14:57.345
And...okay, here's
what we're doing!

14:58.515 --> 15:01.250
Emergency tracheotomy!

15:01.252 --> 15:02.485
Grrrk?!

15:02.487 --> 15:03.319
With a crazy straw?!

15:03.321 --> 15:06.322
It's fine, it's pretty
sterile, that Hairy Navel

15:06.324 --> 15:07.991
was mostly Kentucky Moon.

15:07.993 --> 15:08.691
Grrrgh!

15:08.693 --> 15:10.560
That's not how
you make a Hairy Navel!

15:10.562 --> 15:13.997
I know, it's a new drink, help
me think of a name, so far all I've

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
got is Horatio Cornblower.

15:16.001 --> 15:18.935
Which... Okay, Pam!
Here's what's happening!

15:18.937 --> 15:20.336
I'm gonna make a
small incision in

15:20.338 --> 15:22.638
- your trachea with this...
- Grrrrk?!

15:22.640 --> 15:23.973
Archer!

15:23.975 --> 15:27.043
- Yeah right, that's not sterile...
- Ugh! And since when do

15:27.045 --> 15:28.611
you carry a switchblade?!

15:28.613 --> 15:31.981
It's a long
story, Mother!

15:31.983 --> 15:33.482
Neat.

15:33.484 --> 15:36.518
Well, not so much long as
just not very interesting.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.321
Okay, Pam, you with me? Then, I'm
gonna stick this in the incision,

15:40.323 --> 15:41.322
and you should be good to go.

15:41.324 --> 15:42.023
Ready?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.291
Nnghnnnngh!

15:43.293 --> 15:45.593
I -- no, don't--
Pam, stop it!

15:47.597 --> 15:48.462
Nnghnnnngh!

15:48.464 --> 15:51.298
Okay, sorry in
advance for this...

15:51.300 --> 15:51.932
Ungh!

15:51.934 --> 15:53.367
Unnngh!

15:53.369 --> 15:54.101
Frstrrrdkerrrrrt!

15:54.103 --> 15:56.604
Erperperrrrrn!

15:56.606 --> 15:59.207
Oh my God, the first aid kit!
I think it might have an epi-pen!

15:59.209 --> 16:00.274
Rrrrhrrrr!

16:00.276 --> 16:02.543
Ow, jeez, and
hopefully a cold pack...

16:02.545 --> 16:04.545
Go get the
damn first aid kit!

16:04.547 --> 16:06.914
I am! But not
because you said so!

16:06.916 --> 16:09.549
Just breathe
Pam, it's on the way!

16:09.551 --> 16:12.453
So, you think Cecil's really trying
to steal Cheryl's inheritance?

16:12.455 --> 16:13.654
Who cares?!

16:13.656 --> 16:14.922
Well you should.

16:14.924 --> 16:15.756
Because...?

16:15.758 --> 16:18.226
Because you've been
trying to get your bony manhooks

16:18.228 --> 16:20.995
on her money for years, and
how the hell're you gonna

16:20.997 --> 16:22.496
do that if Cecil gets it?!

16:22.498 --> 16:25.032
Tapes! We have to find
and destroy the tapes there

16:25.034 --> 16:27.268
must be some sort of recording
device somewhere and

16:27.270 --> 16:29.670
why are you still
standing there go!

16:29.672 --> 16:30.604
What about Pam?!

16:30.606 --> 16:31.538
I'll buy you a new one!

16:31.540 --> 16:32.740
Oww!

16:32.742 --> 16:33.941
Grrgh, grrgh!

16:33.943 --> 16:38.612
Oh, quit milking it.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.680
Hey hey hey,
whoa, Lana stop!

16:40.682 --> 16:41.281
What?!

16:41.283 --> 16:44.684
If you damage that, it might
not work in the event of an emergency.

16:44.686 --> 16:45.985
And what would
you call this?!

16:45.987 --> 16:46.919
Oh right.

16:46.921 --> 16:49.488
Speaking of, Pam's dying
of anaphylactic shock.

16:49.490 --> 16:50.623
You got a first aid kit?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.358
I -- it's in the cockpit!

16:52.360 --> 16:54.025
Which is locked,
and -- no nonono!

16:54.027 --> 16:55.627
BLAM
BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM!

16:55.629 --> 16:56.428
Gagh!

16:56.430 --> 16:58.496
And also
apparently bulletproof.

16:58.498 --> 16:59.597
Well yeah, you'd want

16:59.599 --> 17:01.966
it to be, to prevent-
You shot me!

17:01.968 --> 17:03.367
You idiot!

17:03.369 --> 17:06.136
Hey! First of all,
if I shot you you'd know it!

17:06.137 --> 17:08.638
And secondly, now
who's the idiot?

17:08.641 --> 17:10.406
Wh-? You! All of you!

17:10.409 --> 17:11.242
You're here because I wanted

17:11.243 --> 17:12.710
you here, so I could -

17:12.712 --> 17:13.511
Help us get the

17:13.512 --> 17:14.646
hydrogen bomb, yeah.

17:14.647 --> 17:18.383
Oh my God!
There is no bomb!

17:18.385 --> 17:19.517
What?!

17:19.519 --> 17:22.621
Well, guess I
had that coming...

17:22.623 --> 17:24.455
Grrgh!

17:24.458 --> 17:25.691
Well you don't
have to rub it in!

17:25.693 --> 17:30.296
I just wanted to get you people
on tape saying Cheryl was crazy, so I

17:30.298 --> 17:34.300
could get control of her inheritance
to fund my numerous philanthropies!

17:35.303 --> 17:38.204
A-ha! Hang on.

17:38.206 --> 17:43.409
Now shut up! And land...
This... shitheap!

17:43.411 --> 17:46.779
Ahem. Now, I believe there was some
mention of anaphylactic shock?

17:46.781 --> 17:47.580
Thank you!

17:47.582 --> 17:49.381
She's my patient, Lana!

17:49.383 --> 17:52.651
Wait, so if all you wanted was to
get us on tape saying she's crazy...

17:52.653 --> 17:54.452
Which I'm
totally not, by the wrrmp.

17:54.454 --> 17:56.621
You could've done
that in a lawyer's office.

17:56.623 --> 17:59.491
Why drag us all the way out to the
middle of the frickin ocean?!

17:59.493 --> 18:02.594
Well... promise
you won't get mad?

18:02.596 --> 18:04.329
Uh, no?

18:04.331 --> 18:06.264
You ssshole!

18:06.266 --> 18:07.666
Stupid! Drunk ass!

18:07.668 --> 18:11.002
Switchblade
tracheotomygivin dicknuts!

18:11.004 --> 18:11.602
Ow!

18:11.604 --> 18:13.671
Rrrgh!

18:13.673 --> 18:15.839
Sorry, thanks, I
feel a lot better.

18:15.841 --> 18:19.276
Yeah that's why I jammed it
in your neck, I figured if -- oww!

18:19.278 --> 18:20.610
What the
hell was that for?!

18:20.612 --> 18:22.612
Horatio Cornblower?!

18:22.614 --> 18:23.646
I know, right?

18:23.648 --> 18:25.248
You got anything?

18:25.250 --> 18:26.215
Dicknuts.

18:26.217 --> 18:27.516
Okay, we got the tapes!

18:27.518 --> 18:28.517
Big whoop.

18:28.519 --> 18:31.654
I -- wait, I thought you
wanted -what just happened?

18:31.656 --> 18:33.522
It was a hoax!
There is no bomb!

18:33.524 --> 18:35.691
Boom! Guess
you had that comin'

18:35.693 --> 18:37.960
Oh, put another
man's penis in it.

18:37.962 --> 18:42.265
Attention unwelcome passengers...
We are now landing, so please

18:42.267 --> 18:44.701
find your seats and
fasten your seat belts.

18:44.703 --> 18:50.740
Or not, because frankly, I could give
a shit if all you people live or die.

18:50.742 --> 18:53.442
The odds on which I'd put at about...
whatcha think,

18:53.444 --> 18:54.877
Cecil? Fifty-to-one?

18:54.879 --> 18:56.412
Lana? What's going on?

18:56.414 --> 18:57.446
Somebody shot him.

18:57.448 --> 19:00.048
Will you...?
Lana, what's going on?

19:00.050 --> 19:01.683
Why don't you ask Cecil?

19:01.685 --> 19:04.085
Ow! God, your
hands are like --ow!

19:04.087 --> 19:08.355
Well as you may know, one of my many
philanthropic endeavors is an undersea

19:08.357 --> 19:11.458
research laboratory, which, as
luck would have it, is actually

19:11.460 --> 19:12.700
beneath us right now.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.294
Cut. To the chase.

19:14.296 --> 19:18.683
Ow! Anyhoo, the lead scientist is
threatening -- well, he can tell you.

19:18.803 --> 19:22.235
Ahem. Captain Murphy?

19:24.472 --> 19:26.169
Please tell
me you guys heard that.

19:26.289 --> 19:28.256
Ahhhh. Mister Tunt.

19:28.258 --> 19:30.392
Don't worry,
he can't see us.

19:30.394 --> 19:33.562
- No, but I can hear you...
- Although he can hear us.

19:33.564 --> 19:37.802
Yes I can, and please hear me.
For years, decades,

19:37.922 --> 19:41.704
I have begged the so-called leaders of
the world to stop poisoning our oceans.

19:41.706 --> 19:43.907
But they have ignored my pleas.

19:43.909 --> 19:46.331
As I will ignore theirs, Mr. Tunt.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.856
Unless my
list of demands is met in the next...

19:49.976 --> 19:53.806
Tsk tsk, twelve hours. At which
point, I will launch our

19:53.926 --> 19:56.684
missiles on Washington,
Miami, and New York.

19:56.977 --> 19:59.544
Hope everybody has a gas mask.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.380
Why do they
have missiles?!

20:03.382 --> 20:05.516
And what did he
mean by "gas mask"?!

20:05.518 --> 20:08.719
I, you know, that was,
I think, maybe, probably,

20:08.721 --> 20:13.558
because the missiles are definitely
tipped with VX nerve gas?

20:14.594 --> 20:15.660
Oh my God!

20:15.662 --> 20:16.561
What?

20:16.563 --> 20:20.498
The -- it's-- the -- dammit!

20:20.500 --> 20:23.869
Still can't beat
Horatio Cornblower.

20:23.871 --> 20:25.270
Dicknuts!

20:25.272 --> 20:27.506
Hrmmmff.

20:27.573 --> 20:35.046
