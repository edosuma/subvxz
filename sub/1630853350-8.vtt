Take this. I'm paying you
to conduct an investigation

00:04.714 --> 00:07.925
in support of a petition
for factual innocence,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.802
if you believe Jeffrey Herschstadt
is innocent

00:09.885 --> 00:12.972
and that the killer of Dr. Basu
remains at large.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.515
Stay away from my investigation.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.143
Is that what you call it now,
railroading an innocent man?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.145
You're not a cop anymore, Bosch.

with that shooting.

He forced her.

an old man some peace and redemption.

You tryin' to take me
for a ride, Mr. Bosch?

00:44.170 --> 00:46.046

is more than sufficient.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.174

- I know how it feels.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.009
You're on very dangerous ground.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.303
That sounds like a threat
or a bribe, or maybe both.

Sorry.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.062
How did you find me?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.941
You were the lawyer listed on
my mother's appeal for custody.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.401
I figured out the rest.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.571
She worked her butt off
to get you out of that youth hall.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.738
I know she did.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.075

02:38.158 --> 02:40.744

a different view of prostitutes.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.464

With my mother, I mean?

02:54.008 --> 02:56.302

08:10.449 --> 08:12.826
Davis had both hands on the dash.

only the certificate that was issued
to Mr. Cosgrove.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.427
I'll take it, please and thank you.

31:31.515 --> 31:32.641
Detective.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.892
L.T.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.978
Oh, don't stop on my account.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.649
- You see that press conference?
- I did.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.360
Chandler and her bleeding heart crusade.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.654
Don't get me wrong.
Sucks about the girl.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.239
Yeah, it really does.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.617
She did take the cash,
she got back in the car.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.118
What could we do?

31:51.201 --> 31:54.747
Yeah, I-I'm not sure she wasn't
coerced into getting into that car,

31:54.830 --> 31:56.832
either physically or emotionally.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.044
Well, let's see what the bodycam
and cellphone footage tells us.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.337
Facts are facts.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.924
Chandler will distort the truth.
She'll enflame public opinion.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.217
It won't be hard.

32:08.302 --> 32:09.970
We need to stick together on this.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.521
Thank you.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.275
Killer knew what he was doing.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.236
Dr. Basu had five stab wounds,
all to vital blood vessels.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.321
Maximum bleeding.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.324
What can you tell me
about the murder weapon?

32:30.407 --> 32:33.243
The pathologist characterizes
the wounds as...

32:33.952 --> 32:35.996
as smooth slices.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.539
Given the point of entry,

32:37.623 --> 32:41.043
I'd say the blade was anywhere
from between four to six inches in length,

32:41.126 --> 32:42.628
fine-tipped.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.588
Doesn't narrow things down.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.633
I'd wager the assailant has some

32:47.716 --> 32:50.886
military or... or medical background.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.350
Dr. Basu deserved a better investigation.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.688
Thanks for your help, brother.

33:00.771 --> 33:03.148
[cellphone rings]

33:03.232 --> 33:04.233
Excuse me.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.987
Bosch.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.280
It's Vibby.

33:10.572 --> 33:11.865
What's wrong?

33:11.949 --> 33:14.952
There's a man outside.
Been here all day.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.245
I can see him through the window.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.539
He's watching the building.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.623
What does he look like?

33:19.707 --> 33:22.376
He's white. Gray hair.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.711
Okay, okay.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.546
Stay calm. I'm on my way.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.342
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.521
Shit!

33:42.604 --> 33:44.106
The fuck are you doing here, Sloan?

33:44.189 --> 33:47.484
Doing the same thing as you are
and watching Mr. Vance's heirs.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.237
- How do you know about them?
- Mr. Vance told me before he died.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.321
Bullshit!

33:52.281 --> 33:56.493
Look, he asked me to help you,
and I tried... when he took ill.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.120
But you wouldn't believe me.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.334
I'm not the enemy.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.671
Creighton and Corwin are.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.549
I'm on your side, Mr. Bosch.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.137
Okay.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.016
Okay.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.524
Gonna need to move the family soon,
somewhere safe.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.360
Mr. Vance has a place.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.531
Mmm.

34:34.615 --> 34:36.700
This really doesn't tell me anything.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.203
His wife filed a restraining order,
but, uh...

34:39.286 --> 34:40.746
doesn't say why.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.456
Well, I checked their social media,

34:42.539 --> 34:45.334
and Cosgrove and the missus got
in a heated argument over his job,

34:45.417 --> 34:46.627
how he's never home.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.712
Hm. Number-one cop show cliche.

34:48.796 --> 34:52.549
Oh, yeah, I know, right?
Anyway, the neighbors call the cops.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.384
One guess whose side the cops took.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.304
Single incident.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.599
Doesn't prove much one way or the other.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.352
Need me to keep digging?

35:04.436 --> 35:05.562
Can't hurt.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.236
Up late?

35:15.531 --> 35:17.241
Yeah, I went to see Paulina.

35:18.075 --> 35:19.076
You and Perez.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.414
So, how'd that go?

35:26.250 --> 35:28.627
It was very, very nice.

35:28.710 --> 35:29.711
Nice nice?

35:31.588 --> 35:32.798
It was lovely.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.050
All right.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.177
Gonna see him again?

35:41.598 --> 35:43.267
Not a word, okay?

35:43.350 --> 35:44.351
I got you.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.104
He spend the night?

35:47.187 --> 35:48.522
No, I made him go home.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.191
[soft scoff]
I had to get some sleep.

35:51.275 --> 35:52.276
Yeah.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.239
Stop. Back up.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.323
What?

35:58.407 --> 36:01.326
I-I think I saw something.
A-- a man standing outside of a window.

36:01.410 --> 36:03.161
- It looked suspicious.
- Screen Cutter?

36:03.245 --> 36:04.413
I-I don't know.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.789
Call it in.

36:08.166 --> 36:12.045
Six Adam 79, we're Code 6
on the 1300 block of Cherokee,

36:12.129 --> 36:13.630
on a possible attack suspect.

36:13.714 --> 36:15.632
Requesting backup and an airship.

36:38.155 --> 36:40.365
LAPD!
Put your hands up!

36:40.449 --> 36:42.367
- What the fuck?
- Down on your knees, now!

36:43.410 --> 36:44.411
Just taking a leak.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.210
I said get the fuck down.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.723
Taking a leak, huh?

37:05.307 --> 37:07.267
You put this on the Internet, you perve?

37:08.268 --> 37:09.394
Good job, boot.

37:13.649 --> 37:15.484
[Mrs. Davis]
And you're sure he'll leave town?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.402
[Nicole] He knows
he's fucked if he stays.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.780
[Mrs. Davis]
Okay, I'll give him the cash.

37:19.863 --> 37:20.906
[Nicole] Thank you, Momma.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.284
[Mrs. Davis] Do you remember where
we had lunch with Kalon the other day?

37:24.368 --> 37:25.994
[Nicole] Lemon Grove.

37:26.078 --> 37:29.331
[Mrs. Davis] Four o'clock. I'll leave
the money under the same picnic table.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.793
- Does he still have his gun?
- Yes, it-it's in the trunk.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.169
Are you sure?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.338
I saw him put it in there myself.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.507
I'll be okay.

37:39.508 --> 37:40.509
How's Kalon?

37:40.592 --> 37:42.177
He misses you.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.596
Tell him I'll be home soon, okay?

37:44.680 --> 37:45.681
Please.

37:49.476 --> 37:52.104
Just saying, if you go down the street,
they won't even notice.

The Thai Town Peeping Tom.

37:55.482 --> 37:56.733
Seriously, he confessed?

37:56.817 --> 37:59.778
Didn't have a choice.
Found other videos on his phone.

37:59.861 --> 38:03.490
Other women. Stay-at-home moms.
We've got him dead to rights.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.117
- Good work, ladies.
- Detective Coleman.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.495
Anything new on Screen Cutter?

38:08.578 --> 38:09.579
Nope.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.708
Look at you.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.419
Bagged the Thai Town Peeping Tom.

Not bad, Maddie.

Maddie?

38:20.716 --> 38:22.009
Don't let it go to your head.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.057
Do you believe him?
Sloan?

38:29.891 --> 38:30.892
Enough so.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.895
What if she doesn't want it?

38:34.312 --> 38:35.647
It's blood money.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.026
Yeah, it's also change-the-world money.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.319
She'll take it.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.490
We'd better buckle up
'cause they're comin' for her.

Right.
