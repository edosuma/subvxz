WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.103
ADULT ADAM:
Back in the '80s,

00:02.136 --> 00:04.272
there wasn't a Hollywood
awards show every week.

00:04.305 --> 00:07.275
There was just one.
I loved it. The Oscars.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.942
Atta boy, Rain Man!

00:08.976 --> 00:11.445
Eighty-two toothpicks
and one shiny statuette!

00:11.479 --> 00:12.680
Yes, Meryl.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.448
Sophie might've had
a tough choice,

00:14.482 --> 00:15.849
but the Academy sure didn't.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.218
Robert De Niro!

00:17.251 --> 00:19.120
More like Robert my hero.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.954
I agree.
You rocked me, Amadeus.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.524
Who the hell
are you talking to?

00:23.557 --> 00:26.627
ADULT ADAM: But as
an aspiring filmmaker
and son of Beverly Goldberg,

00:26.660 --> 00:29.963
there was another,
lesser-known awards show
I was forced to endure.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.166
And now, the mom-ent
we've all been waiting for,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.768
the Acade-mom Award
for Best Picture.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.170
I thought last year
was the end of this,

00:36.204 --> 00:38.072
when I got my Lifetime
Achieve-mom Award.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.541
Your whining is why
the ceremony always
runs over.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.642
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:41.675 --> 00:43.344
And the Mom-inees are...

00:43.377 --> 00:46.680
Inspector Fudge, a parody,
directed by Adam Goldberg.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.383
We all knew
he was gonna
find the fudge.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.684
It's in his name!

00:50.718 --> 00:52.186
The Partially Dressed Gun,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.722
a parody of the parody
The Naked Gun,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.490
directed by
Adam F. Goldberg.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.725
I didn't care for that one.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.027
'Cause you never saw
the source material!

01:00.060 --> 01:01.962
Adam and Chad Throw Pies
at the Garage,

01:01.995 --> 01:03.864
directed by
Adam F. Goldberg.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.033
That one,
at least I understood.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.668
And the Mommy goes to...

01:07.701 --> 01:09.270
I'm nervous for you, kid.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.205
Adam and Chad Throw Pies
at the Garage,

01:11.239 --> 01:12.973
directed by
Adam F. Goldberg!

01:13.006 --> 01:14.108
(LAUGHS)

01:14.142 --> 01:15.909
Get on up here, Adam!
It's a sweep!

01:15.943 --> 01:17.010
Ah, fine.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.847
Thank you for recognizing
a video I made

01:19.880 --> 01:21.849
to kill three hours
over Labor Day weekend.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.384
Is there anyone
you'd like to thank?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.052
Uh... Thank you
to Mrs. Kremp

01:25.085 --> 01:26.820
for letting us throw pies
at her garage.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.289
And?
Thank you to my father

01:28.322 --> 01:30.090
for buying me blank tapes
to film on.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.193
And? Anyone
who inspired you?

01:32.226 --> 01:34.195
All the other filmmakers
who came before me.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.096
(CHUCKLES) Surely,
there is someone

01:36.130 --> 01:37.931
who always believed in you
and gave you life.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.067
Just say the words, Adam.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.169
Fine.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.603
I'd also like
to thank my mother.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.705
Oh! W-What?
Oh, my God!

01:44.738 --> 01:46.006
That's my son!

01:46.039 --> 01:47.575
I made him,
so I deserve this.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.877
Um, my heart
is racing right now.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.879
I promised I wouldn't cry,
but, uh...

01:51.912 --> 01:54.615
You like me!
You really like me!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.484
* I'm twisted up inside

01:56.517 --> 01:59.753
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

02:02.623 --> 02:03.957
* I don't know the future

02:03.991 --> 02:07.595
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:07.628 --> 02:09.397
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 29th,
1980-something.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.132
Barry and his friends were in
their first adult apartment.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.868
Unfortunately,
they weren't adult enough
to pay their bills.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.970
JTP.
ALL: JTP.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.806
Guys, I am so cold.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.774
I don't think I can make it
another night here.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.975
Also,
have you guys noticed

02:22.009 --> 02:23.577
there's no water
coming out of the faucet?

02:23.611 --> 02:24.712
Hilarious.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.747
We're lovable screw-ups
you can't help rooting for.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.316
Eh, I don't think
anyone would root for us

02:28.349 --> 02:29.750
if they saw our bathroom.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.084
It is rough sledding
in there.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.353
I don't go in there anymore.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.588
I signed up for
a water aerobics class
at the Y

02:34.622 --> 02:36.123
so I can get my body
in water once a week.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.225
Smart.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.660
And I use the Wawa bathroom
down the street.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.162
I don't want to be this guy,
but I'm worried about us.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.832
Silence,
un-silent Matt Bradley!

02:44.865 --> 02:47.435
I have an idea for how
to solve all our problems.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.903
Why am I looking
at toweled morons?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.105
Because our water's out,
so I told everyone

02:52.139 --> 02:54.174
they could use our
free-flowing suburban water.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.444
Well, here's the deal...
Get out!

02:56.477 --> 02:57.978
(GROANS)

02:58.011 --> 02:59.247
I knew this would happen.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.181
And yet you made us
bike across town in the snow

03:01.215 --> 03:02.483
in only robes and towels?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.951
To our frozen bikes.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.719
I have another
surefire iffy idea.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.357
Guess who's auditing
Art History. It's me.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.825
Good for you, babe. I didn't
know you liked art history.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.961
Me neither, but I was
aimlessly wandering
the campus,

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
as I like to do
on Mondays and Fridays

03:15.596 --> 03:16.930
and the other three
weekdays,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.332
and I passed
this lecture hall...

03:18.366 --> 03:19.400
And you got drawn in?

03:19.433 --> 03:20.701
You're ahead of the story,
but yes.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.935
Now the story's
caught up to you.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.203
Well, I'm very happy
for you.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.473
What the hell, JTP?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.541
You're supposed to knock
so we can not answer.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.642
We need your shower.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.710
And your soap.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.911
And your strawberry-scented
conditioner.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.513
And a lift home.
I cannot ride that
ice bike anymore.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.047
No, no, and no, dorks.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.416
Why don't you guys shower
at your place?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.218
Because, Obvious Geoffrey, the
city stopped sending us water.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.120
Did you try calling
so they'll resume service?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.423
No, but in fairness,
there was no way to know

03:42.456 --> 03:44.358
my more impractical ideas
wouldn't work.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.527
Geoff, we need
your sick managerial skills.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.595
Well, too bad, dips.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.230
My worldly fella
is too busy auditing
Art History.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.765
Auditing?
Like, not for credit?

03:51.799 --> 03:52.900
Then why do it?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.568
Because
it's totally inspiring

03:54.602 --> 03:56.437
to expand my horizons through
the pursuit of knowledge.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.171
Since he can't come up
with a reason,

03:58.205 --> 03:59.407
Geoff's gonna focus
on something

03:59.440 --> 04:00.674
that actually does matter...

04:00.708 --> 04:02.710
Our deeply concerning
living situation.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.378
Like Geoff's
actually gonna...

04:04.412 --> 04:05.579
What the hell, dude?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.747
I have time
to help a little.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.881
Smart choice, Geoff.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.750
Now grab some
rubber gloves,
knee pads,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.085
sneakers
you don't care about,
and a plunger.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.087
First task is
more toilet-related
than not.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.724
ADULT ADAM: While the JTP
was finally getting some help,

04:16.757 --> 04:19.727
the AV Club was about to get
some very exciting news.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.094
Listen up, AV scrubs.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.364
Every club has to have
a faculty advisor.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.800
Due to me losing
12 consecutive rounds
of rock-paper-scissors,

04:26.834 --> 04:27.935
I'm yours.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.204
Anyway,
as I tend to see things
through a sports lens,

04:31.238 --> 04:32.740
I've decided
that we're gonna have

04:32.773 --> 04:34.542
a school-wide
movie championship.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.176
You mean like
a film festival?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.911
I've been begging for one
for years.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.447
Count Johnny Atkins in.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.714
Johnny Atkins?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.182
Since when are you
in the AV Club?

04:42.215 --> 04:44.251
Since they found asbestos
in the detention room.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.819
Heh! (COUGHS)

04:45.853 --> 04:47.087
Question, Coach Advisor.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.922
Is there
a format restriction?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.824
8 millimeter?
16 millimeter?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.259
Super 8? Super 16?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.794
Super annoying question!

04:53.827 --> 04:55.095
Make a movie!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.197
Dealer's choice
on the format. Nice.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.401
Just know I like movies
about sports, war,

05:00.434 --> 05:02.370
and lost dogs
finding their way home.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.737
Looks like
Banjo's Christmas Journey

05:03.771 --> 05:05.072
just got greenlit.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.207
What can we expect
from our big-time
director over here?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.677
My development slate
for next year is pretty full,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.845
but I can fast-track
a festival darling.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.113
He's totally insufferable.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.415
That's how you know
he's the best.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.384
Although, I might take
a quick do-si-do

05:16.417 --> 05:17.751
outside my comfort zone.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.253
I'll be working
in the new Super VHS.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.655
But you'll need to buy
a new camera.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.090
Silly Emmy.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.858
I'm what you call
completely spoiled.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.394
ADULT ADAM: Yep, my mom
was always there

05:26.427 --> 05:27.861
when I needed
or wanted something,

05:27.895 --> 05:29.797
and fortunately,
we had a shorthand.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.331
Hey, Mama...
From your tone,

05:31.365 --> 05:34.101
I can tell you're gonna
need more fancy and
expensive camera equipment.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.704
From your tone,
I'm getting that you'll
happily pay for it.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.706
See, there's...
A film festival at school?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.508
How exciting!
And I know...

05:40.541 --> 05:42.876
Deep in your heart
that I'm gonna win
because I'm, by far...

05:42.910 --> 05:45.446
The most talented boy
in the world? Yes!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.314
Here. I'll give you a...
Blank check so I can...

05:47.347 --> 05:48.716
Go to the camera store
and get...

05:48.749 --> 05:50.584
Whatever I need,
no questions asked,
because you...

05:50.618 --> 05:51.885
Love and believe in you
like...

05:51.919 --> 05:54.254
No mom has ever loved
and believed in her son.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.322
Thanks...
Mama. You're...

05:55.355 --> 05:57.591
Welcome,
my sweet forever-baby.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.694
Dude, a real relationship's
gonna be very hard
for you one day.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.696
Oh, he already has
a real relationship.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.064
With me.
(CHUCKLES)

06:04.097 --> 06:06.667
We had a ceremony
and everything
when he was four.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.736
Take this
to the camera store
and spend hard.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.671
ADULT ADAM: While I was
on my way to get
some new equipment,

06:10.704 --> 06:13.607
the JTP had found
someone equipped to help.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.543
Okay, so,
I spent the morning
making some repairs.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.644
I snaked the toilet...

06:16.677 --> 06:17.745
There was a snake
stuck in there?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.212
Ohh!
ROB: Awesome!

06:19.246 --> 06:21.649
What a tale of survival.
Nature is amazing.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.551
Not an actual snake.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.018
And moving on.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.721
I patched the walls,
set up a house account,
and paid your bills.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.322
Now all that's left
for you guys to do

06:29.356 --> 06:31.224
is call the gas company
and set up an appointment

06:31.258 --> 06:32.325
for them
to turn it back on.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.894
Or you do it

06:33.927 --> 06:36.029
and we'll watch so we'll know
how to do it next time.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.631
I can't guarantee
I'm gonna watch.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.501
I-It's a big hassle,
and there's often a lot
of time on hold, so...

06:40.534 --> 06:42.002
That's no way to sell us
on doing it, bro.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.738
Geoffrey, as a "thank you"
for the tasks you've done

06:44.772 --> 06:46.073
and the many that remain,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.842
I'm gonna cede my title
as house manager to you.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.644
No... The house manager
should be someone

06:50.678 --> 06:51.845
who actually lives
in the house.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.913
And plus,
I'm pretty busy now.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.182
It's just, I fear
it won't get done

06:55.215 --> 06:57.250
and Andy's little body
won't survive the winter.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.052
(COUGHS)

06:59.086 --> 07:00.888
Okay, fine!
I'll be your
house manager!

07:00.921 --> 07:02.523
Atta boy!
And take it from me,

07:02.556 --> 07:03.891
it's a pretty cushy
position.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.259
The other guys give you
hundreds of dollars
every month.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.595
Actually, Bar,
that's for rent.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.563
Oh.
That makes more sense.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.365
Too bad the taxidermist said
no refunds or exchanges.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.501
You said
you found them!

07:13.534 --> 07:15.903
No.
I said I posed them.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.970
This is gonna be
a nightmare.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.305
Yeah, it is.
Slap me some paw.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.708
ADULT ADAM:
While Geoff was realizing
he was a pleaser,

07:20.741 --> 07:22.275
I was beyond pleased
to be shopping

07:22.309 --> 07:24.144
for cutting-edge
film technology,

07:24.177 --> 07:25.746
the S-VHS camera.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.414
Oh, my God.
It's glorious.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.750
Totally.
But why, exactly?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.285
According to people
in the know,
it's slightly better.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.254
You'll be paying
so much for so little.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.389
I need it and don't care
what it costs my parents.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.958
Excuse me? Sir?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
Could you show me
this bad mamma-jamma?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.529
Be prepared to have
your world nudged.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.231
ADULT ADAM:
It was my former rival,
the other Adam Goldberg!

07:44.264 --> 07:46.133
It's you!
Adam Goldberg!

07:46.166 --> 07:47.601
I heard you went
to Hollywood.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.937
Technically, I was living
in a town called Duarte,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.539
but yeah,
I chased my dreams.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.241
Word on the street is you had
a line on The Love Boat.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.076
Yep. "Which one of you ladies
ordered the white wine?"

07:56.109 --> 07:58.979
Also booked
a rad McDLT spot,
but... Whatever.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.113
You were the dude
who suggests

08:00.147 --> 08:02.115
they keep the hot side hot
and the cool side cool.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.617
So, what are you
doing back here?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.252
Reevaluating.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.587
It's rough out there, man.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.656
My McDLT spot
was seven months ago.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
Since then,
I haven't exactly been

08:10.057 --> 08:11.491
on the hot side
of the burger box.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.093
But you're crazy talented.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.162
I had big dreams,
but the streets of Hollywood

08:15.195 --> 08:16.363
are littered
with guys like me.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.632
And actual litter.
Place is filthy.

08:18.666 --> 08:22.002
No offense, but...
I'll probably make it,
right?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.204
You may be the best filmmaker
in your dinky school,

08:24.237 --> 08:25.639
but you'd be
a dime a dozen
out there.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.940
Goldberg!

08:26.974 --> 08:29.442
Stop crushing
customers' dreams
and get on that rickety ladder

08:29.476 --> 08:30.944
and pull down
one of the heavy TVs.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.647
Enjoy making your little
high school movie, kid.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.815
It's only downhill
from here.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.219
Did you buy your recklessly
expensive camera, Schmoo?

08:39.252 --> 08:43.190
Actually, I've decided
to give up filmmaking forever.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.291
What?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.627
But that's
your life's ambition.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.829
Eh. Maybe I'll be a lawyer.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.297
Or a CPA.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.865
I don't know...
Bricklayer.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.966
Is that a real thing?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.301
Manual labor?

08:54.334 --> 08:55.535
Look at me.
Look at me.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.338
Who did this to you?
Nobody did anything.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.240
I just bumped into
the other Adam Goldberg

09:00.273 --> 09:01.675
working
at the camera place.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.510
Oh, feh on him!
What does he know?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.478
Only everything.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.649
He was
the most talented person
to ever go to our school,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.684
and now he's back here,
selling cameras.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.354
If he can't do it,
I never will.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.923
Here's your check back,
Mom.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.526
This isn't over,
is it?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.961
Nope.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.964
You're gonna go destroy
that poor other Adam Goldberg,
aren't you?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.265
Damn right I am.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.035
Why do I bother asking?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.770
I know all the answers.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.007
ADULT ADAM: After realizing
he was too much of a pleaser,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.876
Geoff sought help
from the one person

09:35.909 --> 09:37.444
who never
pleased anyone at all.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.979
Why are you
in front of the TV, Schwartz?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.547
It's a quarter
to Remington Steele.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.750
Mr. G, I-I'm worried
I'm a pleaser.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.752
Well, you're not
pleasing me right now.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.253
Everyone always wants me
to do stuff for them,

09:46.286 --> 09:47.587
and I don't know
how to say no.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.456
Y-You never
do anything
for anyone.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.991
It's easy. Lump.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.093
As in just sit there
and never move?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.194
Definitely.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.896
But also L-U-M-P.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.865
It's my secret for not doing
anything for anyone.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.633
You're a lazy monster,
and that's what I need.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.002
Please, let me learn
at your idle feet.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.937
Okay, first up is L.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.106
Lower expectations.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.108
It's something
I've perfected over time.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.410
Dad, can you quiz me
with these science
flash cards?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.745
Ah, who am I kidding?

10:11.779 --> 10:14.314
In all my years,
you've never shown
interest in my education.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.283
He thinks
you're a worthless dad.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.918
That took
a lot of not doing.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.419
Next up is U.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.555
When there's no way
out of something, underwhelm.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.191
This is
how you wash a dish?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.294
Okay, no more
washing dishes for you!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.763
You did a horrible job,
and now she'll never
ask you again.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.331
I'm the worst.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.200
Next up is M,

10:33.233 --> 10:35.903
which stands for "mumble"
and "moron."

10:35.936 --> 10:38.271
Hey, Dad, can you
show me how to change
the oil in my car?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.273
(MUMBLING)
What does that even mean?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.509
Leave me alone,
ya moron!
Pbht!

10:42.542 --> 10:45.445
So brilliant!
So, what's P?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.947
It's the thing
I'm most proud of.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.416
Pants.
Pants?

10:49.449 --> 10:52.485
Why do you think
I come in the house
and take off my pants?

10:52.519 --> 10:54.254
I assumed
it had to do with comfort

10:54.287 --> 10:55.756
and generally
just giving up.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.224
Yes, but also,

10:57.257 --> 11:00.627
who's the least likely person
to be asked to do anything?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.329
Oh, my God.
The guy with no pants.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.799
Hey, Mur, could you give me
a ride to the pharmacy...

11:05.833 --> 11:08.635
Oh, he's not even
wearing pants.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.070
I'll bus it.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.439
My God. You have
given me such a gift!

11:12.472 --> 11:14.908
It's my life's work.
Don't waste it.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.910
Get out there
and do as little
as you can.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.246
I'm gonna do nothing
and make you proud.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.513
ADULT ADAM:
With my dad's advice,

11:20.547 --> 11:22.382
Geoff was ready
to be a lump of his own.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.852
Hey, Geoff, could you run
to the mailroom
and get my mail for me?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.319
He lowered expectations.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.955
Erica, when have I ever done
stuff like that for you?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.322
Only all the time.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.925
Yeah, well,
not in the last two minutes,
so stop expecting it.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.993
He underwhelmed.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.327
Geoff, you said

11:34.361 --> 11:35.996
you were going to make
a chore wheel for our house.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.297
Oh, right, right.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.100
Here you go.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.035
Yeah, this seems
less like a chore wheel

11:42.069 --> 11:44.972
and more like a napkin
with the words "Andy"
and "mop."

11:45.005 --> 11:46.506
That's how Geoff do?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.875
Unacceptable, Geoff!

11:47.908 --> 11:50.010
Your chore-wheel-making
privileges are revoked.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.178
And you need to come over.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.545
Our clean-up skills
are not strong.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.047
I spilled
a lot of Kool-Aid.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.817
Whatever you picture
a lot is, like, way more.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.819
He mumbled
and he moron-ed.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.387
(MUMBLES)
What?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.355
And also leave me alone,
morons!

12:02.389 --> 12:04.191
Super un-Geoff
of you, man.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.159
Are you going to
get my mail or not?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.762
Finally, it was time
for the pants.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.697
Oh. It's about time
he's swinging into action.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.332
(ZIPPER OPENS)

12:12.365 --> 12:13.500
BARRY: What?
ANDY: No!

12:13.533 --> 12:15.668
Bad Geoff!
He's not wearing pants.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.070
Dude's clearly
not going anywhere.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.307
Okay, let's go, guys.
Maybe there's a panted savior
that can help us.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.708
Holy crap.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.344
My pants are on the floor,
and my spirits
are through the roof.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.613
While Geoff
was trying to be like my dad,

12:26.646 --> 12:29.016
my mom was busy being...
Well, like my mom.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.550
Can I answer any questions
for you, ma'am?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.785
Oh, just one.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.686
Uh, who the (BLEEP)
do you think you are?

12:33.720 --> 12:36.756
Whoa!
This is a family-friendly
audio-video store.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.892
Except for that section
over behind the saloon doors.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.394
You spoke to my son,
also Adam Goldberg,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.797
and snuffed out
his perfect
little-boy dreams.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.732
Look, lady,
I just call 'em
like I see 'em.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.734
It's tough to make it
in the movies.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.036
Oh, for you, maybe.
(CHUCKLES)

12:49.069 --> 12:50.938
But not for my little
Stanley Schmoo-brick.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.973
Well, that gives me a sense
of what I'm dealing with here.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.108
Next time, I won't
burst the little bubble
you keep him in.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.910
No next time.
This time.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.111
You are gonna fix this.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.880
And how am I
gonna do that?
Simple.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.915
I'm casting you
in the role of a lifetime,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.917
as "guy who gets
his big break."

13:03.951 --> 13:05.718
Sorry, but I kinda
put acting on hold.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.221
Well, take it off hold.
The pay's $50.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.523
(SCOFFS)
Well, I suppose
I could throw in,

13:10.557 --> 13:12.625
uh, me not
coming down here
every day

13:12.659 --> 13:13.927
and making
your life miserable.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.528
All right,
I'm on the project.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.564
ADULT ADAM: Now that
my mom had her cast,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.799
all that remained
was the performance.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.568
Hello and welcome.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.636
Hey, Adam, did you leave
this Philadelphia Inquirer

13:23.670 --> 13:24.972
Metro section
at the store the other day?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.240
Nope. Sorry.
Huh.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.842
Well, I better figure out
whose it is soon,

13:28.876 --> 13:31.011
'cause I gotta catch a flight
to Hollywood, California,

13:31.044 --> 13:32.645
moviemaking capital
of the world.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.948
But I thought you were
reevaluating your
career choice.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.917
I was, but then I got
some amazing news.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.818
See, my, uh,
ex-roommate's
cousin's neighbor

13:38.852 --> 13:40.587
is friends with
Brian De Palma's
agent's assistant,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.222
and slipped him
my McDLT commercial.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.690
Ooh. Seriously?

13:43.723 --> 13:46.026
But, wait, there's more.
I'd imagine.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.227
The assistant got it
to the agent,

13:47.260 --> 13:48.795
who got it to De Palma,
who liked what he saw

13:48.828 --> 13:50.998
and cast me in his new
Molly Ringwald picture.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.132
Holy balls!

13:52.165 --> 13:54.834
America's angsty
ginger princess!

13:54.868 --> 13:56.636
And I bet that could lead
to other things.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.571
No truer words
have ever been spoken.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.941
Well, good luck on
one of the easiest careers
you could ever choose.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.043
And, uh, call me.
We'll split a salad at Spago.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.878
Doesn't sound
like enough food,
but I'm in!

14:04.912 --> 14:05.979
(BEVERLY GASPS)

14:06.013 --> 14:07.447
Oh, wow!

14:07.480 --> 14:08.949
I mean, just, wow.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.952
If something so random
and amazing could happen
to him,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.786
I bet there's hope
for you, too, huh?

14:13.820 --> 14:16.289
You know it!
I'm back in the festival.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.791
See ya, babe.
Have your people
call my people.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.061
ADULT ADAM:
While my movie dreams
were back on track,

14:21.094 --> 14:23.997
the JTP was trying to keep
the train from derailing
without Geoff.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.865
So... Cold!

14:25.899 --> 14:27.000
Whose turn is it
to sweep?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.436
I don't know, but according
to Geoff's chore napkin,

14:29.469 --> 14:30.737
it's Andy's turn
to mop again.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.605
