00:06.673 --> 00:08.307
                     Boy.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.510
        Master.
                        Oh.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.278
             Hello, Jeannie.
        What are you doing here?

00:13.314 --> 00:15.180
Well, it is almost midnight.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.882
                   Oh, really?
                Is it that late?

00:16.917 --> 00:19.485
I have your dinner waiting
 for you at home, master.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.253
        Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna
             have to finish

00:21.288 --> 00:23.155
              all this paperwork
             before I can leave.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.124
 I, um-- I won't be able to make
dinner at home tonight, Jeannie.

00:25.159 --> 00:25.857
                          Sorry.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.792
Ah! Then I shall
 bring it here.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.927
     [LAUGHS]

00:28.962 --> 00:31.796
Dinner is served!

00:34.168 --> 00:36.034
                           Well.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.303
             Well, this is
      really something, Jeannie.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.139
                    You really
                  are marvelous.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.407
                     TONY:
                 This banquet
              is fit for a king.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.944
                 JEANNIE:
         Oh, but you are a king,
                O master.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.815
               TONY:
   This is absolutely wonderful.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.786
JEANNIE:
Oh, I am so glad.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.388
      Would you like
      a roast sheep?

00:57.424 --> 00:59.457
            No. No, not tonight.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.893
        I may even have a little
         difficulty eating this.

01:06.533 --> 01:10.201
An orgy with a harem girl
        at NASA?

01:10.237 --> 01:11.370
                Yes, sir.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.438
I don't believe it.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.340
     I wouldn't have believed it
           either, general,

01:15.376 --> 01:17.242
             if I hadn't seen it
              with my own eyes.

01:17.277 --> 01:20.278
   Major Nelson must've smuggled
     her onto the base somehow.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.614
         Why, there was enough
       food there for 50 people.

01:22.649 --> 01:23.849
                General, please.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.950
   The other guests are probably
        arriving right now.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.719
If you woke me up
in the middle of the night

01:27.755 --> 01:29.688
for another one of
your wild goose chases--

01:29.723 --> 01:32.223
         Sir, I saw this myself.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.693
           This time I've caught
               Major Nelson.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.128
All right. Let's go.

01:38.832 --> 01:42.066
      Would you like some
   smoked breast of peacock?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.436
                Ah, all right,
             I'll give it a try.

01:44.471 --> 01:47.138
          Do you think
   I am a good cook, master?

01:47.173 --> 01:49.474
       Mmm, delightful, Jeannie.
         Absolutely delightful.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.743
   Ah, and you are not angry
       that I came here?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.244
                No, no.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.246
         I'm delighted you did.
        You don't have to worry.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.916
  In the daytime it's dangerous.
   Bellows never comes at night.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.019
There's your orgy, sir.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.461
             [♪♪♪]

03:04.651 --> 03:06.417
           Ah, did you, uh--?
        Did you say "orgy," sir?

03:06.453 --> 03:08.319
      No, he said "orgy."

03:08.355 --> 03:10.021
      Didn't you, doctor?

03:10.056 --> 03:12.757
  I'll finish cleanin' in here,
 I'll get on to the next office.

03:12.792 --> 03:13.758
Uh, just a moment.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.127
How long have you been
in this office?

03:16.163 --> 03:18.229
           Oh, about 45 minutes.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.432
And you didn't see a lady
in here with a...

03:20.467 --> 03:22.000
scanty costume?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.702
          No, but I'll sure keep
           my eye open for her.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.673
   Ah, well, well, maybe it was
  one of the other offices, sir.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.975
            They all look alike,
                  you know.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.543
          What are you
      eating there, major?

03:31.578 --> 03:34.779
Oh, this is, uh, breast of pea-
     Cheese sandwich, sir.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.182
          Ah, it's hardly enough
           for 50 people, is it?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.351
It was all so vivid!

03:39.386 --> 03:41.986
  I saw the girl,
I-- I saw the food.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.087
                And you're going
                    to see me

03:43.122 --> 03:45.289
              tomorrow morning
           at 8:00 in my office.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.124
          We're gonna talk about
            waking up generals

03:47.160 --> 03:48.760
                   in the middle
                   of the night.
  Yes, sir.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.362
               And I'll say
         one thing more, doctor.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.264
         The next time you think
            that Major Nelson

03:53.300 --> 03:56.968
   is guilty of anything wrong,
  you better have it in writing.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.704
I'll remember that, sir.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.004
                Yeah, goodnight,
                   gentlemen.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.840
                Good night, sir.
                   Good night.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.231
    Jeannie.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.566
        Jeannie, you can
         come out now.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.302
Jeannie, come on.
I'm not angry at you.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.345
        You really are not angry
            with me, master?

04:40.381 --> 04:42.113
No, no, of course not.
As a matter of fact,

04:42.148 --> 04:44.549
I-- I think maybe it's the
best thing that ever happened.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.884
Uh, I just come from the base,

04:45.919 --> 04:48.420
and Dr. Bellows is gonna be
apologizing to General Peterson

04:48.455 --> 04:50.856
for the next six months.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.424
       Oh, I don't think
      we'll have to worry

04:52.459 --> 04:53.792
   about Dr. Bellows anymore.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.994
Oh, that is wonderful.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.529
I am so happy.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.998
     You have been
terribly nervous lately.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.467
Yeah, well, you'd be nervous too
    if you had a psychiatrist

05:02.503 --> 05:04.703
        watching your every move
             24 hours a day.

Ah, well, now that the danger
has passed, just relax.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.275
            With Dr. Bellows
              off my back,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.010
        I feel like I'm floating
               on a cloud.

               that's great.

                     You know...

05:26.293 --> 05:28.893
     You know, after last night,
         I really need a nap.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.764
            Ah, Jeannie.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.434
     Jeannie, that's-- That's
 enough of the rocking, I think.

                marvelous.

                 to rest.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.217

            to do this.

              of room.

     Why don't you come up here
              with me?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.292
I don't have a ladder.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.328
       Well, hello, Dr. Bellows.

<i> You're</i> asking me
what <i> I'm</i> doing?

The question is,
what are you doing, major?

         Well, you see,
         I can explain.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.843
Don't say a word.

               Just write.

             Just write,
    "I, Major Anthony Nelson..."

06:24.084 --> 06:25.316

          I finally got you.

07:08.328 --> 07:11.196
              Oh, you mean
       the old levitation trick.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.663
The old levitation trick?

07:12.699 --> 07:15.366
             Yes, ah, well,
        I'm an amateur magician.

07:15.401 --> 07:16.735
     Well, you didn't think

07:16.770 --> 07:20.171
  that I could actually float
     in the air by myself.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.206
      Oh. You have a very
     suspicious mind, sir.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.175
       Well, that's what
    General Peterson told me

07:24.210 --> 07:26.444
 for two hours and 15 minutes.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.746
I don't care
what anyone says, major.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.850
       I saw a harem girl
   in your office last night,

07:32.886 --> 07:35.386
     and I saw you floating
      in the air just now.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.754
        Yeah, whoa, yes,
          but I said--

07:36.789 --> 07:38.589
I know
what you said.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.326
So you're a magician.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.593
Well, we're gonna
    find out

07:42.629 --> 07:44.396
just how good a magician
    you really are.

07:44.431 --> 07:47.765
And you better be good, major.
You better be very good.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.036
         Well-- The thing--
    This can all be explained...

07:53.039 --> 07:55.140
              Oh, he is up to
          something bad, master.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.242
Yeah, you're telling me.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.244
          Would you like me
     to turn him into something?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.279
No, no, Jeannie.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.215
I just hope he doesn't
turn me into something.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.917
Like, maybe, a civilian.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.729
           You mean, Dr. Bellows
          caught you in the air?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.932
Yeah. Jeannie couldn't
 get me down in time.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.101
          And before that,
    he caught you in the office.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.903
Roger, he's driving me crazy.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.771
         Well, what do you think
           you're doing to him?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.572
            It's a question of
         which one cracks first.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.809
Well, I'll tell you who's
gonna crack first, I am.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.576
       Look, as long as he can't
            prove anything,

08:32.611 --> 08:33.977
                 there's nothing
                 to worry about.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.546
Yeah, well, I don't know
      about that.

Dr. Bellows is no idiot,

08:37.183 --> 08:39.650
  Dr. Bellows is-- Ah, we were
  just talking about you, sir.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.751
I'll bet you were. And I was
just talking about you.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.054
We're putting on
 a little show

08:43.089 --> 08:44.789
  for the personnel
at the base Saturday.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.990

     thought you might help
         to entertain.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.828
Me? Well, I don't really
do anything, sir.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.163
   Don't be so modest, major.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.299
                   Modest? Tony?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.734
  You're the greatest magician
      in the whole world.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.936
    Uh, you can do a little
    magic act for us, major.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.771
          Oh, ah, no--
       Well, I-- I just--

09:00.807 --> 09:03.541
I'll tell General Peterson
that you've accepted.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.543
Well, uh, goodbye,
    gentlemen.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.179
            Roger--

09:08.214 --> 09:09.380
 Master.
             Yeah?

09:09.415 --> 09:10.849
Be careful,
it is a trap.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.618
Look, why don't you get yourself
sent to detached duty somewhere?

09:13.653 --> 09:14.919
  Listen, if I'm not careful,

09:14.955 --> 09:17.088
   I'm gonna be detached
from the astronaut program.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.090
        Look, uh, what makes you
          think something's up?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.959
      Please do not appear
     in this show, master.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.259
 I haven't any choice, Jeannie.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.762
       I already told him
   I was an amateur magician.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.831
         You're gonna have to be
         a professional magician

09:26.867 --> 09:27.932
              to get outta this.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.201
 I can turn you into
a wonderful magician.

09:30.237 --> 09:34.305
      No, no, that's just
  what I don't want, Jeannie.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.807
 Saturday night I'm gonna go up
 there as an amateur magician,

09:36.843 --> 09:39.511
       and Doctor Bellows
won't be able to prove a thing.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.414
           [HUMMING]

09:42.449 --> 09:47.285
Oh, operator, I'd like to place
  a call to Cincinnati, Ohio.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.655
         I want to talk
      to Nestor the Great.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.526
          N-E-S-T-O-R.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.560
         That's right.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.529
     At the Palace Theater.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.563
           Thank you.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.471
 Um, now, ladies and gentlemen,
      I want you to notice

10:06.506 --> 10:09.374
   I have absolutely nothing
         up my sleeves.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.309
I take an ordinary walking cane,

10:11.344 --> 10:13.545
   which I turn,
by the use of magic,

10:13.580 --> 10:15.846
into a beautiful bunch
     of flowers.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.682
You're a real amateur's amateur.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.819
  They don't make these things
   the way they used to. I...

10:21.854 --> 10:23.721
  Oh! That is lovely, master.

10:23.756 --> 10:24.923
     There you are, madam.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.691
Eh, and now
for my next trick,

10:27.727 --> 10:28.960
       I will-- Oh, yes.

10:28.995 --> 10:32.363
     Uh, for my next trick,
   with your kind attention,

10:32.398 --> 10:36.367
   I will make this, uh, er,
  everyday, ordinary, um, um--

10:36.402 --> 10:38.970
           Fish bowl?
           Fish bowl.

10:39.005 --> 10:43.307
    Fish bowl disappear into
thin air before your very eyes.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.342
             Bravo!

10:46.312 --> 10:48.746
       Jeannie, I haven't
      done the trick yet.

10:48.782 --> 10:52.817
              Oh. Sorry.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.620
Abracadabra, kalamazoo!

10:55.655 --> 10:57.055
Um, uh...

10:58.558 --> 11:00.791
                [LAUGHS]

11:00.827 --> 11:03.294
   Jeannie, I would very much
    like to do my own magic.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.432
   Are you sure you're ready
       for show business?

11:10.436 --> 11:12.603
 Now, for my next trick, uh...

11:12.639 --> 11:13.905
  I will need my hat, please.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.439
            [SIGHS]

11:15.475 --> 11:17.942
             Sure.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.310
           Thank you.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.611
                  Wait a minute.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.747
      You're not going to
   break an egg in your cap?

11:22.782 --> 11:25.349
Well, believe it or not, this is
 the easiest trick in the book.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.320
    I will now, with the aid
       of my magic wand,

11:29.355 --> 11:30.788
and, uh, a little bit of magic,

11:30.824 --> 11:35.827
         turn this egg
      into scrambled eggs.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.496
  Er, abracadabra, kalamazoo,
            presto!

11:38.531 --> 11:39.697
      And here we have...

11:45.104 --> 11:47.472
   Oh, that's the funniest thing
    I ever saw in my whole life.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.473
         That is lovely.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.774
               Did you see that,
                  Jeannie? Oh!

11:49.809 --> 11:51.843
      Wait until I tell the guys
        in the base about this.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.144
        Oh, you scrambled an egg
               in my hat.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.349
      Oh, my-- Oh, my hat.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.260
Flowers and the silk.
 Oh, yeah, the silk.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.828
And the bag, right.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.764
           Please, master,
    let me turn him into a frog.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.965
        No.
                     A bat?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.967
 Jeannie, Dr. Bellows
is only doing his job.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.670
             And you are only
         doing your job, master.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.706
Yeah-- Well, unfortunately,
  my job does not include

12:21.741 --> 12:23.441
   floating around
in my own living room.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.176
            Can you not say
       that you had an accident?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.645
         Then you would not have
          to do your magic act.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.247
They'd never believe me.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.982
         Oh!

12:32.018 --> 12:35.119
    Oh, really,
that's too obvious.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.422
Look, let's face it, I've got to
     go through with this.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.090
             And I want you
        to promise me something.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.358
Oh, yes, master.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.560
      I want you to promise me
    that no matter what happens,

12:42.596 --> 12:44.629
       no matter what, you won't
         help me with my magic.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.465
Oh, I cannot
promise you that, master.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.002
I have seen your magic, and you
need all the help you can get.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.105
              Uh, that's beside
             the point, Jeannie.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.106
       I want you to promise me.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.975
 Oh, but--
                 Jeannie.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.311
Very well, master.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.347
I promise I will not help you
with your magic.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.048
                   Thank you.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.585
        Aren't you even gonna...
           wish me good luck?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.687
Well, I'll be happy
to wish you good luck,

13:09.723 --> 13:12.990
but I have a terrible feeling
it is not going to do any good.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.598
                Jeannie, please.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.999
     Hmm?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.069
                   Thank you.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.145
I'm afraid I don't understand,
         Dr. Bellows.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.446
               Oh, sit down, uh,
                  Mr. Nestor.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.547
           Thank you.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.850
You mean, you brought me
    all the way here

13:39.886 --> 13:41.986
just to watch
another magician perform?

13:42.021 --> 13:45.156
       Uh, well, this man is not
        a magician, Mr. Nestor.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.758
               He's an imposter.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.360
Well, if you already
know that, why do you need me?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.362
              Well, I need you
               to expose him.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.164
      You see, there's one trick
             that he does

13:53.199 --> 13:54.231
           that I can't explain.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.232
     Ah.

13:55.268 --> 13:59.203
       Um, he floats in the air.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.204
Floats in the air!

14:00.239 --> 14:01.306
                     Yes.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.108
            Um, he calls it
       the old levitation trick.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.378
Oh, my dear doctor,
that is child's play.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.614
We use a mechanical
device for that.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.416
            Well, I'm well aware
                  of that.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.185
             But, uh, there was
           no mechanical device.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.053
                  I checked.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.822
No mechanical device?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.089
                That's right.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.558
                 I want you
           to watch him tonight.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.194
                   Uh, tell me
                 how he does it.

14:23.229 --> 14:27.031
Don't worry, doctor. There
is not a trick in the world

14:27.066 --> 14:29.667
Nestor the Great
cannot explain.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.136
    Oh, you have no idea how I'm
   counting on that, Mr. Nestor.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.904
                 Oh, the show
              is about to begin.

14:33.940 --> 14:34.939
                    Shall we go?

14:35.908 --> 14:36.941
                    Here we are.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.115
    Now, you've heard about
          babysitters.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.182
    Here's a monkey-sitter.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.785
       Ah, right around.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.788
         Right around.
      Come on, up and in.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.490
           [APPLAUSE]

14:55.195 --> 14:57.295
       Um, would you like to sit
         in front, Mr. Nestor,

14:57.330 --> 14:58.962
            where you can get
         a good view of his act?

14:58.998 --> 15:00.964
Oh, it does not matter
where I sit.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.134
I can spot a phony
a mile away.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.921
                           Tony!

15:23.956 --> 15:25.890
          Tony, Nestor the Great
         is out in the audience.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.025
Yeah, yeah.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.792
     Yeah. I just heard him tell
             Dr. Bellows

15:28.828 --> 15:30.294
              that he can spot
            a phony a mile away.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.529
       You gotta get outta here.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.696
  Hey, you're on next, major.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.065
      Oh, uh,
   thanks, sarge.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.866
         You mean, you're really
            gonna go out there

15:35.902 --> 15:37.168
       and walk into their trap?

15:37.203 --> 15:39.237
Well, I really don't have
 any other choice, do I?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.838
              You don't seem
          very worried about it.

15:40.873 --> 15:41.839
No. No, I'm not.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.107
                      What's up?
        I am.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.443
Or, at least I will be when
I get on this little beauty.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.445
       What is it? It looks like
             an erector set

15:47.480 --> 15:49.280
          that got carried away.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.382
Roger, this is what
we magicians use to levitate.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.384
         You're really going
    to float in the air on that?

15:53.420 --> 15:56.220
      Mm-hmm. And, uh,
when Mr. Nestor examines it,

15:56.256 --> 15:58.389
he won't have any choice
but to tell Dr. Bellows

15:58.425 --> 16:01.459
 that it's an everyday,
normal magician's trick.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.626
               And you'll be
               off the hook.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.994
    That's right.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.196
                 Oh, you're
              a genius, Tony.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.898
     Come on, quick, buddy.
     Come on, turn around.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.401
           [APPLAUSE]

16:21.247 --> 16:22.213
         Good luck, major.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.215
   Oh, thank you.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.316
You're on, major.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.285
   Oh, um, now, you remember
        what I told you.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.153
      I want you to wheel
    this contraption in back

16:29.188 --> 16:31.555
   of the curtains over there
in the exact spot I showed you.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.823
  And when I say the lines...

16:32.858 --> 16:35.326
         BOTH:
  "I feel the spirits
    lifting me up."

16:35.361 --> 16:37.028
  Yeah, that's when you start
           the motor.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.762
Okay.
           Uh, okay.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.799

      to be here tonight.

    Uh, what's this,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.602
            This is the gadget
          that Major Nelson uses

18:25.637 --> 18:26.937
            to help him float up
                 in the air.

18:26.973 --> 18:27.972
          Is it?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.373
Well, you underestimate him.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.941
    Major Nelson
doesn't need anything

18:30.977 --> 18:32.142

   in the air.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.880
             to wheel it out
         in back of the curtain.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.884
And I'm telling you not to.
He's a major and I'm a colonel.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.985

18:41.020 --> 18:42.853
                   No, sir.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.222
   Now, ladies and gentlemen,
  I'd like to perform from you

18:45.258 --> 18:47.891
a rather spectacular trick I've
 been working on for some time.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.460
    It's, uh, as we call it
          in the trade

18:49.495 --> 18:50.961

18:52.865 --> 18:54.298

  spirits are lifting you up.

           the machine, colonel.

 float without it.

      one moment, please.

     my levi--? Oh, Dr. Bellows.

Good evening,
Major Nelson.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.868
  I-I-- Now, I told you I wanted
       my levitation machine

19:31.904 --> 19:34.238
      right behind that curtain
     over there. You understand?

19:34.273 --> 19:36.840
Major Nelson, I have
a signed statement from you

19:36.875 --> 19:39.910
saying that you were
floating in the air.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.079
There was no levitation
    device around.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.615
Now, either you're going out
       on that stage

19:44.650 --> 19:46.917
and float in the air
without this device,

19:46.952 --> 19:49.653
  or you're coming with me
to General Peterson's office

19:49.688 --> 19:51.722
and explain a lot of things.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.424
    And explain a lot of things?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.025
That's right, major.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.061
How you float,
why you talk to walls,

with Major Healey's safe.

of 103 separate incidents.

Now, either you get back
out there on that stage

20:07.940 --> 20:10.241
 and do the old
levitation trick,

20:10.276 --> 20:11.942
   or come with me
to General Peterson's.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.678
Now, which is it
   gonna be?

20:14.713 --> 20:17.214
         I'll come with you to
      General Peterson's office.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.783
Good. Now, go back
out there and say goodnight.

20:19.818 --> 20:20.784

     Ladies and gentlemen,

20:31.531 --> 20:36.300

ahem, to make myself disappear.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.338
    I'm sorry I wasn't able
      to perform the trick

20:41.374 --> 20:43.007
 I prepared for you, but, uh--

20:43.042 --> 20:44.842
I told you Tony
was in trouble.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.543
         He is supposed to float
               in the air.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.012
   But, Jeannie,
you gotta help him.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.181
              Oh, but I promised
               that I would not.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.382
This is an emergency.
If he doesn't float in the air,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.685
Dr. Bellows is going
to think something's wrong,

20:54.721 --> 20:56.386
 and Tony'll get in
all kinds of trouble.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.521
         Do you really think so?

20:57.556 --> 20:58.622
I know so.

help him this time.

what he is doing is impossible.

    A magician's trick, sir.

              a wonderful trick.

23:20.999 --> 23:24.301
      He used to take a seed
 and cover it over with a cloth,

    in the middle of the stage.
