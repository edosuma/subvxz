[Ace] Hey!

00:08.300 --> 00:09.427
-You okay?
-I sprained my ankle.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.053
I left the DWL because
no one really likes me.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.471
I'm gone because
any other promotion

00:12.638 --> 00:13.806
would've run me out of town.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.182
We're not any other promotion.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.061
I'm sorry I put the DWL first.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.522
I'm sorry
I kept your son from you.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.816
-Can I stay here?
-Of course.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.317

Shocking video has surfaced

00:28.738 --> 00:30.531
of NFL linebacker
Chris DeLeo

00:30.656 --> 00:31.907
assaulting his wife.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.784
This follows
a disturbing trend

00:33.951 --> 00:35.286
of athletes
and domestic violence--

00:35.411 --> 00:37.121
We need a women's division.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.789
We can't have Crystal
getting beat on each week

00:38.956 --> 00:40.875
by every man on our roster
and vice versa,

00:41.000 --> 00:41.876
she can't run through
everyone.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.711
It's a nice little story.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.504
We've pulled it off this far,
but it's not sustainable.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.798
You help me restore
my honor in the ring

00:47.965 --> 00:51.802
with a cross-promotion
between the DWL and Dystopia

00:51.969 --> 00:54.430

there's a time
if you'd lost the DWL,

03:32.630 --> 03:36.133
I wouldn't have minded,
but it'd devastate you.

Jack, I'm not trying
to be a Pollyanna here,

just apologizing to Gully?

I let things get out of hand.

your brand of wresting,

things that the DWL is not.

Jack went to his lawyer

09:23.939 --> 09:25.649

he wouldn't win in court.

And now he trying
to wiggle out from under.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.323

09:33.448 --> 09:35.158
that I owe you an apology

and punching you.

vocalizing that particular

is all that matters.

-[Gully] "I'm sorry."

09:58.515 --> 10:00.475
in front of a crowd
conditioned to shout,

10:00.642 --> 10:02.519
"Gully is God", which means
that you punched God.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.438
Which kind of violates
the whole

10:04.604 --> 10:07.649
narrative character
construction of God.

10:07.816 --> 10:12.321
May I shuttle in some
diplomacy in this bitch?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.073

10:15.240 --> 10:17.701
Now, I understand
that you got some momentum,

10:17.868 --> 10:20.287
but FWD has a bigger fanbase,
bigger arena,

10:20.454 --> 10:22.539
and bigger social media.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.333

to all of that.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.876
[Jack] Yeah, that's if
there's a good story,

10:26.043 --> 10:28.754
but if the rest of it sucks,
nobody wins.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.213
Jack, it's wrestling.
It's not Faulkner.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.548
Oh, well, he wants it to be.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.051
I don't care, okay, Jack?

10:34.217 --> 10:37.054
You've already admitted
that I have you over a barrel.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.222
Okay? Your punch means
that I can file my lawsuit

10:39.389 --> 10:40.849
and take your promotion
at any time.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.267
I don't want to do that, okay?

10:42.434 --> 10:43.977
If you'd just do
this cross-promotion,

10:44.144 --> 10:46.313
the slate is wiped clean.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.815
Your debt is paid.
We can move on from each other.

There is only one goal here:

10:51.568 --> 10:53.945
to turn your punch
from a shoot into a work

10:54.112 --> 10:55.697
so that my character
is restored

10:55.822 --> 10:57.074
to its rightful authority.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.201
So that is
what we are going to do.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.540

to you two professionals

we need--

11:30.273 --> 11:32.401

I don't know what the story is.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.946
Sure you do.
You practically wrote it

11:36.113 --> 11:37.948
longhand while you was
bitching to Gully.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.908
It's a brand war.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.618
[Rooster] Your style
versus Gully's style.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.245
He's your villain,
you're his,

11:43.370 --> 11:44.496
and the fans get to pick sides.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.498
And you get to yell out

11:46.665 --> 11:48.917
all the nasty shit you feel
about Dystopia out loud.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.670
Yeah, but who wins?

11:51.837 --> 11:54.840
To be determined.
Uh, probably a split decision.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.842
Something that everyone
can go home happy.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.510
It's not gonna pop.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.804
Because we both gonna be
yelling into the void.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.973

going to hear our side

only gonna hear yours.

You're right.

gonna give yourself

gonna give me one.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.922
wanna convey pain, you gotta
set it up with want and need.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.007
And so, yeah,
I was thinking want and needs

the stories, you know?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.512
Yeah, Diego, trying to follow
your train of thought

13:23.678 --> 13:24.971
is like trying
to fuck a kangaroo

But he doesn't commit
to anything till last minute.

When I was a kid in Miami,

out of all four turnbuckles.

was him backstage

-Because this is work.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.372
Mistake most wrestlers make

14:32.539 --> 14:35.250
is they treat these conventions
as a ego stroke.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.003
The status of my ego
is irrelevant.

The goal for the day is

14:39.796 --> 14:41.298

of the fan.

the more money they spend,

they got a bigger fanbase,
