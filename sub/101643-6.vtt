WEBVTT

00:21.602 --> 00:24.146
THE MANDALORIAN: Bo-Katan
sent me to talk to you.

00:25.648 --> 00:26.982
I hope it's about him.

00:29.276 --> 00:31.362
Grogu and I
can feel each other's thoughts.

00:31.445 --> 00:32.446
THE MANDALORIAN: Grogu?

00:32.947 --> 00:35.241
AHSOKA TANO: Yes. That's his name.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.494
THE MANDALORIAN: I've been quested
to bring him to his kind.

00:38.994 --> 00:41.330
I must deliver him to a Jedi.

00:42.289 --> 00:43.791
Go to the planet Tython.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.418
There, you will find
the ancient ruins of a Temple

00:46.502 --> 00:48.420
that has a strong connection to the Force.

00:49.505 --> 00:52.049
Place Grogu on the seeing stone
at the top of the mountain.

00:52.675 --> 00:54.426
If he reaches out through the Force,

00:54.510 --> 00:58.472
there's a chance a Jedi may sense
his presence and come searching for him.

01:07.690 --> 01:08.858
OFFICER: Moff Gideon.

01:11.735 --> 01:14.363
The tracking beacon
has been installed on the Razor Crest.

01:14.446 --> 01:16.156
Does he still have the asset?

01:16.740 --> 01:18.200
Our source confirmed it.

02:05.956 --> 02:07.541
-Grogu.
-

02:14.798 --> 02:15.799
Grogu?

02:20.012 --> 02:21.013
Give me the ball.

02:23.641 --> 02:26.435
Grogu, give me the ball.

02:27.436 --> 02:28.437
Come on.

02:34.693 --> 02:36.195
Okay, here we go.

02:39.198 --> 02:41.450
You can have it, just like before.

02:45.788 --> 02:48.165
Grogu, come on. You can have it.

02:52.378 --> 02:53.671
Come on.

02:56.507 --> 02:58.175
-Dank farrik!

03:00.010 --> 03:03.138
Hey, no. I'm not mad at you.
You did good.

03:03.722 --> 03:04.723
I just...

03:05.683 --> 03:08.394
When the nice lady said
you had training, I just...

03:16.569 --> 03:19.280
-You're very special, kid.
-

03:20.281 --> 03:22.700
We're gonna find that place you belong

03:22.783 --> 03:24.827
and they're gonna take
real good care of you.

03:30.249 --> 03:31.625
This is Tython.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.170
That's where we're gonna
try and find you a Jedi.

03:35.337 --> 03:39.550
But you have to agree to go with them
if they want you to. Understand?

03:41.719 --> 03:43.220
Plus, I can't train you.

03:43.929 --> 03:45.347
You're too powerful.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.435
Don't you wanna learn
more of that Jedi stuff?

03:53.564 --> 03:55.733
I agreed to take you back
to your own kind,

03:55.816 --> 03:57.193
so that's what I need to do.

03:58.402 --> 03:59.403
You understand, right?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.947
Looks like that's the magic rock
I'm supposed to take you to down there.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.010
Sorry, buddy. I can't land on the top.

05:05.094 --> 05:06.095
Too small.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.849
We're gonna have to travel
the last stretch with the windows down.

05:41.630 --> 05:43.507
THE MANDALORIAN: Well, I guess this is it.

05:55.227 --> 05:56.979
Does this look Jedi to you?

06:06.947 --> 06:08.532
I guess you sit right here.

06:14.914 --> 06:16.624
Okay. Here we go.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.254
This is the seeing stone,
are you seeing anything?

06:25.132 --> 06:27.134
Or are they supposed to see you?

06:30.930 --> 06:35.184
Maybe there's
some kind of control or something.

06:53.994 --> 06:55.162
Oh, come on, kid.

06:55.829 --> 06:58.791
Ahsoka told me all I had to do
was get you here and you'd do the rest.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.661
Time's up, kid. We gotta get out of here.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.460
We don't have time for this.
We got to get...

07:48.340 --> 07:50.926
Hey! Snap out of it, kid!

07:51.635 --> 07:53.137
We got to get out of here!

08:14.283 --> 08:16.243
I'll see if I can buy you some time.

08:16.327 --> 08:18.037
Can you please hurry up?

08:46.065 --> 08:47.900
MAN: I've been tracking you, Mandalorian.

09:02.081 --> 09:03.207
THE MANDALORIAN: Are you Jedi?

09:06.752 --> 09:08.420
Or are you after the Child?

09:19.390 --> 09:20.683
I'm here for the armor.

09:22.017 --> 09:25.020
If you want my armor,
you'll have to peel it off my dead body.

09:27.857 --> 09:29.316
I don't want your armor.

09:30.526 --> 09:34.947
I want my armor that you got
from Cobb Vanth back on Tatooine.

09:35.447 --> 09:36.657
It belongs to me.

09:38.242 --> 09:39.660
Are you Mandalorian?

09:40.452 --> 09:43.205
I'm a simple man
making his way through the galaxy.

09:44.081 --> 09:46.083
Like my father before me.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.169
Did you take the Creed?

09:49.253 --> 09:51.463
I give my allegiance to no one.

09:51.964 --> 09:54.592
The beskar belongs to the Mandalorians.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.802
It was looted from us during the Purge.

09:56.886 --> 09:58.679
The armor was my father's.

09:59.305 --> 10:00.556
Now it's mine.

10:00.639 --> 10:03.809
What's to stop me
from dropping you right where you stand?

10:03.893 --> 10:06.729
Because I have
a sharpshooter up on that ridge

10:07.438 --> 10:10.983
with a locked scope that will unload
by the time my body hits the ground.

10:11.984 --> 10:13.736
I'm the one wearing beskar.

10:13.819 --> 10:17.281
As soon as I see that muzzle flash,
you're both dead.

10:17.364 --> 10:19.825
I didn't mean she was going to shoot you.

10:20.618 --> 10:24.747
My friend's locked onto that
little companion of yours up on the henge.

10:25.497 --> 10:28.125
SNIPER: And if you remember,
I don't miss.

10:28.209 --> 10:29.210
THE MANDALORIAN: Fennec?

10:29.293 --> 10:31.253
FENNEC SHAND: You have a keen ear, Mando.

10:35.925 --> 10:38.219
THE MANDALORIAN: You point
that gun away from the kid

10:38.302 --> 10:39.887
or I'll drop you both where you stand.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.391
Let's all put down
our weapons, have a chat.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.602
There's no need for bloodshed.

10:46.685 --> 10:48.395
Tell her to drop the gun.

10:48.479 --> 10:50.314
After you put down the jetpack.

10:51.524 --> 10:52.525
Same time.

10:54.401 --> 10:55.444
Stand down.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.927
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.428
You were dead.

11:21.512 --> 11:26.183
MAN: She was left for dead
on the sands of Tatooine, as was I.

11:27.101 --> 11:30.354
But fate sometimes steps in
to rescue the wretched.

11:30.437 --> 11:34.900
In my case, Boba Fett was that fate.

11:37.528 --> 11:38.821
And I am now in his service.

11:40.906 --> 11:42.116
I want my armor back.

11:42.950 --> 11:45.327
THE MANDALORIAN: It goes against
the Mandalorian Creed.

11:45.411 --> 11:49.331
The armor was given
to my father, Jango, by your forebears.

11:49.915 --> 11:54.003
In exchange, I guarantee the safety
of the Child, as well as your own.

11:54.503 --> 11:57.798
The bounty on your little friend
has risen significantly.

11:57.882 --> 12:00.718
You can buy ten suits of armor
for the price on its head.

12:00.801 --> 12:04.054
I'd say we're offering a fair deal
under the circumstances.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.957
Time to go, kid!

13:07.993 --> 13:10.120
STORMTROOPER 1: Go, go!
Advance and take...

13:20.339 --> 13:21.715
Up top. Move out!

13:36.438 --> 13:38.190
STORMTROOPER 2: Flank left and from above.

13:38.274 --> 13:39.525
Sir, there's too much fire!

13:39.608 --> 13:40.985
-Flank them, you idiot!
-

13:42.528 --> 13:44.196
Up top! Get up there!

15:31.512 --> 15:35.516
One, two...

15:42.439 --> 15:44.525
-STORMTROOPER: Get back! Get...
-

15:53.033 --> 15:54.326
Go, go!

16:08.674 --> 16:10.092
-STORMTROOPER: No.
-

17:03.896 --> 17:05.981
STORMTROOPER: Flank left. Move out!

17:06.065 --> 17:07.525
THE MANDALORIAN: That's it, kid.

17:07.608 --> 17:08.984
We got to get out of here!

17:23.123 --> 17:24.542
Okay, I'm gonna protect you.

17:25.251 --> 17:27.670
Just stay there. I'll be back soon.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.612
STORMTROOPER: Give yourselves up!

17:53.904 --> 17:55.948
We don't want you, we want the Child.

18:02.746 --> 18:04.373
THE MANDALORIAN: Okay, let's move in.

18:06.876 --> 18:08.419
This isn't looking good.

18:09.003 --> 18:10.462
THE MANDALORIAN: I've seen worse.

18:11.505 --> 18:14.133
You can get out of here.
I owe you from last time.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.885
We have a deal.

19:09.897 --> 19:11.815
STORMTROOPER: Back to the ship!
Back to the ship!

19:16.028 --> 19:17.321
Go! Go!

19:54.316 --> 19:55.359
THE MANDALORIAN: Nice shot.

19:55.901 --> 19:57.486
BOBA FETT: I was aiming for the other one.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.712
Better get to your ship.

20:26.265 --> 20:27.266
THE MANDALORIAN: The kid!

20:33.606 --> 20:34.648
OFFICER: Direct hit.

20:35.608 --> 20:37.776
Have the dark troopers been engaged?

20:40.112 --> 20:41.113
Momentarily.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.734
FENNEC SHAND: They've got the baby.

22:00.818 --> 22:02.027
Don't let them get away!

22:02.111 --> 22:03.112
BOBA FETT: Affirmative.

22:05.698 --> 22:06.782
I have a lock.

22:06.866 --> 22:08.158
THE MANDALORIAN: Stop him.

22:08.242 --> 22:09.535
I don't want the Child hurt.

22:09.994 --> 22:11.871
FENNEC SHAND: Abort pursuit. Disengage.

22:11.954 --> 22:13.414
Do not harm the Child.

22:13.497 --> 22:16.876
BOBA FETT: Copy. I'll do a loose follow,
see where they're headed.

22:38.564 --> 22:40.274
-They're back.
-FENNEC SHAND: Who?

22:40.941 --> 22:42.026
BOBA FETT: The Empire.

22:42.484 --> 22:43.652
They're back.

22:43.736 --> 22:44.737
FENNEC SHAND: That can't be.

22:45.112 --> 22:47.781
The Outer Rim is under
the jurisdiction of the New Republic.

22:47.865 --> 22:49.700
BOBA FETT: This isn't a spice dream.

22:50.201 --> 22:52.995
I can see the Imperial cruiser
with my own eyes.

22:54.455 --> 22:55.623
Heading down.

24:14.243 --> 24:16.120
THE MANDALORIAN:
This is all that survived.

24:16.912 --> 24:17.955
Beskar.

24:20.249 --> 24:22.209
I want you to take a look at something.

24:24.044 --> 24:27.965
My chain code has been encoded
in this armor for 25 years.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.303
You see, this is me. Boba Fett.

24:33.470 --> 24:34.972
This is my father, Jango Fett.

24:37.725 --> 24:39.435
THE MANDALORIAN:
Your father was a foundling.

24:39.518 --> 24:40.561
Yes.

24:41.228 --> 24:44.064
He even fought
in the Mandalorian Civil Wars.

24:44.982 --> 24:47.067
THE MANDALORIAN:
Then that armor belongs to you.

24:48.652 --> 24:50.196
I appreciate its return.

24:51.655 --> 24:53.490
THE MANDALORIAN:
Then our deal is complete.

24:53.866 --> 24:55.034
Not quite.

24:55.117 --> 24:56.118
THE MANDALORIAN: How so?

24:57.328 --> 25:00.372
We agreed in exchange
for the return of my armor,

25:00.456 --> 25:02.416
we will ensure the safety of the Child.

25:03.250 --> 25:04.627
THE MANDALORIAN: The Child's gone.

25:05.628 --> 25:08.672
Until he is returned to you safely,
we are in your debt.

25:35.282 --> 25:38.035
THE MANDALORIAN: Cara Dune,
Marshal of the New Republic.

25:40.079 --> 25:41.997
I heard rumors you might have gone legit.

25:42.081 --> 25:43.707
I wouldn't go that far.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.210
I need your help.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.711
Name it.

25:47.795 --> 25:50.339
I need you to locate someone
in the prison registry.

25:51.257 --> 25:52.508
Let's see what I can do.

25:55.427 --> 25:58.430
THE MANDALORIAN: Ex-Imperial sharpshooter,
last name Mayfeld.

25:59.181 --> 26:02.309
Apprehended near the Dilestri system
on a derelict prison ship.

26:04.228 --> 26:05.354
CARA: Migs Mayfeld.

26:06.063 --> 26:08.607
Serving 50 years
in the Karthon Chop Fields

26:08.691 --> 26:10.359
for springing a prisoner himself.

26:11.193 --> 26:13.404
Accessory to the death
of a New Republic officer.

26:13.487 --> 26:15.072
Huh. Sounds like a real piece of work.

26:15.155 --> 26:16.782
What do you want with him?

26:16.866 --> 26:20.411
I need to spring him to help me
locate Moff Gideon's light cruiser.

26:21.829 --> 26:23.706
You know how I feel about the Empire.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.583
But these stripes...

26:26.417 --> 26:28.169
mean there are rules I need to follow.

26:31.255 --> 26:32.381
They have the kid.

27:31.106 --> 27:32.525
-STORMTROOPER: Set to stun.
-Wait.

27:52.002 --> 27:53.754
You've gotten very good with that.

27:54.463 --> 27:58.384
But it makes you oh-so sleepy.

28:00.594 --> 28:02.388
Have you ever seen one of these?

28:04.807 --> 28:06.475
From years past?

28:13.065 --> 28:15.067
Oh, uh-uh-uh.

28:17.361 --> 28:19.572
You're not ready to play with such things.

28:19.655 --> 28:21.699
Liable to put an eye out
with one of these.

28:23.117 --> 28:26.954
Looks like you could use
a nice, long sleep.

28:34.044 --> 28:35.045
Put it in shackles.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.509
When we come out of hyperspace,

28:40.593 --> 28:43.012
send an encrypted message to Dr. Pershing.

28:43.095 --> 28:45.514
Let him know we have got our donor.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.682
Yes, sir.
