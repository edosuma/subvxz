our fabulous goods to.

But it's you.

With the Tour de France coming up as well,
all the kids want a bike.

- Alright, how much?
- Now we're talking.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.375
- OK...
- Alright...

05:19.500 --> 05:22.000
- Can you just give us a moment, please?
- You got this?

05:22.125 --> 05:24.000
Don't suppose we'll get
a lot of money off her.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.500
- I ain't got time, Georgie.
- OK.

05:27.292 --> 05:29.583
- 60 each.
- Nah.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.417

let's just take 'em somewhere else.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.333

What I would say to Georgie,
the advice I'd give to her, is...

05:53.208 --> 05:56.958
...it's... it all goes...
it goes like that.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.000
Like a... a circle.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.833
So, you're born and
then everyone... everyone dies.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.208
But hopefully, she doesn't die soon,
cos she's a child.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.917
Yeah, Georgie's
a very nice person really.

06:10.042 --> 06:12.875
You keep chatting rubbish.
She's not a good person.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.500
- She keeps stealing our bikes.
- Yeah, but not mine.

06:16.583 --> 06:17.958
We don't like her.

06:18.625 --> 06:21.125
She doesn't even know
how to apply foundation.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.167
An entire day off?

06:24.292 --> 06:27.042
It just doesn't take an entire day off
to grieve, it just doesn't.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.083
I'm sorry, it doesn't.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.708
You know, a morning off.
A morning off, that's all it takes.

06:31.833 --> 06:36.542
Take a morning off, come back,
get over it.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.125
Obviously, very sad.

06:41.458 --> 06:44.500
- Extremely.
- So... sad.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.875
Lovely though that she's living with...

06:52.542 --> 06:54.458
Er... her uncle.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.125
Winston Churchill.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.042
Disgusting.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.042
Absolutely disgusting!

07:24.708 --> 07:26.708
Ah, beautiful.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.750
Josh, could you do me one favour?

07:33.875 --> 07:37.250
- No more voice recordings.
- Ah, but you're so good at 'em.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.708
What do you want me to say?

07:43.875 --> 07:46.583
"Georgie is doing great at school,
thanks."

07:50.208 --> 07:52.500
Georgie's doing great at school, thanks.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.500
Say it like you mean it, then.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.833
Let's try that again.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.375
Georgie's doing great
at school, thanks.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.167
Ah, that's actually...
Ah, that's amazing.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.250
That was so good.

08:06.375 --> 08:10.375
Um... "We are thinking
of getting a hamster."

08:14.333 --> 08:16.500
We're thinking of getting a hamster.

08:16.625 --> 08:20.583
'A hamster? I mean
great, yeah. Good for you, good for you.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.958
'How's Georgie getting on?'

08:23.083 --> 08:27.292
- 'We are fine, thank you.'
- 'That's good, good.

08:27.417 --> 08:30.417
'Emotionally coping with the situation?'

08:30.542 --> 08:33.457
'We are eating
spaghetti bolognese today.'

08:33.582 --> 08:36.832
'I find that
cheers me up, yeah.

08:36.957 --> 08:41.000
'Both big fans of the bolognese.
I don't blame you. It is delicious.

08:41.125 --> 08:44.917
'Maybe Georgie can tell me a little bit
more about how she's getting on.

08:45.042 --> 08:48.042
- 'Would she be free for a little chat?'
- Hello!

08:48.167 --> 08:50.667
'Hiya! How you getting on?'

08:50.792 --> 08:53.542
Good. I'm very busy at the minute,
so I've got to go.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.125
'OK, well, have a nice tea!

08:57.417 --> 08:58.958
'Winston?'

08:59.083 --> 09:02.500
- 'We are fine, thank you.'
- 'Er, OK. Great.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.083
'Well...
I, for one, feel reassured.'

09:49.333 --> 09:50.917
Mum!

09:51.667 --> 09:53.875
Mum!

09:58.083 --> 10:00.458
Georgie!
Hey, I'll call you back.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.750
Can Ali stay tonight?

10:02.875 --> 10:06.875
- OK. Are you gonna be in bed by ten?
- Before ten!

10:07.000 --> 10:10.042
OK, good. Does your uncle not mind?

10:10.583 --> 10:14.042
- He doesn't mind.
- I would really like to meet your uncle.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.958
Yeah, my uncle's really busy
at the minute.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.583
- Busy?
- Yeah.

10:18.708 --> 10:20.958
OK, but how are you coping?

10:21.083 --> 10:22.583
Dance.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.000
Mum, do you wanna see our dance?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.000
- OK, show me the dance.
- Alright.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.542
To the left.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.833
Good moves, kids. Good moves.

10:41.917 --> 10:44.333
- It's purple.
- It's not.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.917
- It's literally purple.
- It's not.

10:48.042 --> 10:51.042
- What colour is it, then?
- Pink.

10:55.542 --> 10:56.958
Get up.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.000
Amazing!

11:42.083 --> 11:44.375
Leave them how they were!

11:44.500 --> 11:47.333
- It ain't comfy like that.
- Well, that's how Mum did it.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.292
- Doesn't always have to be the same.
- Yes, it does.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.000
Move your feet!

12:04.583 --> 12:05.875
- What do you wanna watch?
- Er...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.667
- No.
- Why not?

12:07.792 --> 12:09.250
Not again.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.750
I'm sick of not being able
to vacuum up them spiders and all.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.583
How could you even consider
killing Napoleon?

12:16.708 --> 12:19.583
You know that's my guy from day.
Always got my back!

12:23.125 --> 12:25.833
Genghis, a bit of a mad guy,
but still my G!

12:27.750 --> 12:30.833
Julius and Maggie T,
those two little love birds.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.875
Disgusting, bruv!

12:38.917 --> 12:40.042
And Alexander the Great.

12:45.917 --> 12:48.417
RIP, my certy guy.
What a devastating blow.

12:48.542 --> 12:51.667
Please stop talking about it.
Very annoying.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.083
Agh!

13:02.708 --> 13:05.750
Can you get your stinky feet
out of my face?

13:11.375 --> 13:13.167
What stage of grief are you at now?

13:14.625 --> 13:17.667
I think I'm almost finished.
Stage three or four?

13:18.542 --> 13:21.042
But I'll get through
the other stages quick.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.458
But you literally had a go at me
for moving the pillows.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.458
Everything's still the same
as how your mum did it, you know?

13:32.417 --> 13:33.417
Mum...

13:35.542 --> 13:38.292
She said she was going up into the sky.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.042
What?
Like to real heaven and that?

13:42.167 --> 13:44.083
Like, proper proper?

13:45.917 --> 13:47.167
Dunno.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.458
What were you doing in that room again
before I came?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.042
Um... playing.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.708
I could play, too, if you want.
Only if you want company, though.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.042
No.

14:02.167 --> 14:04.000
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

14:05.292 --> 14:08.000
- Goodnight, Georgie.
- Shut up!

14:37.250 --> 14:39.250
Nah, nah,
Stace, hear, man.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.708
He's just not hubby material,
I'm telling you.

14:41.833 --> 14:45.167
The other day he was like to me,
"Ah, I think you're the one."

14:45.292 --> 14:48.042
Me? Girl, bye...

15:03.875 --> 15:05.375
'Why are you filming me?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.833
'Georgie, please get that camera
out of my face!

15:07.958 --> 15:10.375
- 'What is wrong with you? Turn it round.'
- 'Nah!'

15:10.500 --> 15:14.083
- 'That day five of those pyjamas?'
- 'What was that?'

15:14.208 --> 15:16.042
- 'Day five with no shower?'
- 'Huh?'

15:16.167 --> 15:18.583
- 'Can smell you a mile off!'
- 'Excuse me!

15:18.708 --> 15:20.875
'Shall we tell the camera
what I've just pulled out of your hair?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.750
'Shall we tell them?
A nice big juicy nit!'

15:23.750 --> 15:25.833
'I probably got them from you,
anyway.'

15:25.958 --> 15:28.708
'No, you didn't!

15:28.833 --> 15:31.167
'Get it out, please. You're grounded.'

15:39.042 --> 15:41.375
Hello, hello, hello
and welcome to...

15:41.500 --> 15:45.458
Crusty Musty, um...
Helping Hand Lip Show.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.792
Today, we are selling
this red lipstick palette.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.333
Now, here we have Clive.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.417
As you can see,
Clive's lips are very crusty.

15:54.542 --> 15:58.375
- Just like the gentleman in the studio.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.708
We have lots of callers on the phone
at the minute.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.833
- What's this made out of?
- Um...

16:03.958 --> 16:06.958
Endangered, um, shredded lizards

16:07.083 --> 16:10.167
and crushed-up ruby diamonds.

16:10.292 --> 16:14.875
Now, we are looking
for a low-low price of £2 million...

16:15.000 --> 16:16.625
How much?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.250
I think you heard me, sir.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.208
- Now, we have lots and lots...
- Wait, who's that?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.917
What you doing in my garden?

16:28.042 --> 16:30.250
- Alright, kids?
- No, we ain't.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.917
Are you Georgie?

16:33.667 --> 16:35.208
Who's asking?

16:38.458 --> 16:40.000
I'm Jason.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.250
I'm your dad.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.500
Owner of that top.

16:51.958 --> 16:53.917
No, you ain't. My mum give me this.

16:54.042 --> 16:55.958
Yeah, I gave it to her.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.666
- What, you living on your own, then?
- No.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.166
- Can I come in for a chat?
- Get out!

17:19.833 --> 17:23.041
Right, so I'll tell the Social there's
a 12-year-old living on her own, shall I?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.292
You let him in.

17:34.417 --> 17:37.583
What do you expect me to do?
He was gonna call the Social on me.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.208
Yeah, but...

17:40.292 --> 17:41.583
Exactly.

17:41.708 --> 17:45.458
How are you gonna sleep at night knowing
that he's lurking around the house?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.458
Shall we have dinner later?

17:47.583 --> 17:49.792
David Beckham's welcome as well.

17:49.917 --> 17:50.917
No.

17:51.042 --> 17:53.333
Don't be like that. It's free food.

17:54.042 --> 17:55.625
Free food?

17:56.417 --> 17:59.042
Are you serious?
Can you stop thinking about the food?

17:59.167 --> 18:02.167
He could be using it
to blackmail us or something.

18:02.292 --> 18:04.625
- Or trying to poison us.
- Exactly.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.833
Yeah, you seriously can't trust him,
though.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.542
- I got an idea.
- Hm?

18:13.417 --> 18:16.458
Can you go and get us a Chinese then
from the place down the street?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.625
- It's our favourite.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.792
- We're gonna go out and play.
- Right.

18:20.917 --> 18:23.667
- Can you make sure you're back for six?
- Whatever.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.625
Who's David Beckham?

18:27.750 --> 18:30.875
What we're gonna do,
he's gonna go out and get the Chinese,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and we're gonna be waiting
somewhere nearby.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.625
We'll bolt the door from the inside
and then we'll climb out.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.083
And then we won't let him back in.

18:40.042 --> 18:42.292
Yeah, and we'll chuck his stuff
out the window, right?

18:42.417 --> 18:47.792
Well, if it's worth anything,
we'll consider keeping it, OK?

18:47.917 --> 18:49.417
Yeah, I guess.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.417
OK, so hear me out on this one, yeah?

18:51.542 --> 18:54.167
Can you make a werewolf
and a vampire hybrid?

18:54.292 --> 18:56.542
Right, so let's say I've got a vampire
and I get the vampire blood,

18:56.667 --> 18:58.333
and I get a werewolf
and I get the werewolf blood,

18:58.458 --> 19:00.667
and you get them together and you start
mixing them, take them to a science lab,

19:00.792 --> 19:02.333
put them in a science beaker thing,

19:02.458 --> 19:04.875
put them in a box
and leave it for ten years to freeze.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.458
And once you come back
after ten years,

19:06.583 --> 19:09.458
there's a werewolf
and vampire hybrid baby!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.833
That's actually so stupid.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.458
I can't believe... Oh, my gosh.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.833
I thought you were smarter than that.

19:20.958 --> 19:23.500
Well, Jason can't be a vampire, right?

19:23.625 --> 19:26.958
Cos your mum was mad superstitious
with garlic and that at the front door.

19:31.667 --> 19:34.333
No, he's not a vampire.
That's just stupid.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.250
Maybe he might, like,
start growing uncontrollably at night,

19:37.375 --> 19:39.833
come into our rooms
and start sucking our neck!

19:39.958 --> 19:41.708
Nah, that's a bit weird.

19:43.292 --> 19:44.667
Maybe he was in prison.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.042
What if he's a big-time gangster?

20:41.583 --> 20:44.875
They're both proper weirdos.
Who breaks into their own house?

21:17.042 --> 21:20.500
- Chicken and sweetcorn.
- Yeah, no, no, in the sandwiches.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.417
- Oh!
- And in the pies.

21:22.542 --> 21:23.542
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.667
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But the gravy is kind of, er...

21:25.792 --> 21:29.292
- Yeah, the gravy's a bit too thick.
- Bit too thick.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.958
The rest of it, though. Banging.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.833
All my money for them. Lovely.

21:34.958 --> 21:38.042
- Well, actually, you paid for me, innit?
- Yeah, exactly.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.417
- Be grateful.
- Such a kind friend you are.

21:40.542 --> 21:43.375
- Yeah, I know. I am.
- Yeah!

21:44.833 --> 21:47.250
- Sign's gone!
- Alright, bye.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.750
Bit cold now, this Chinese.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.625
It's ungrateful as well, ain't it, really?

22:04.750 --> 22:07.083
If someone's buying food for you
and your little mate,

22:07.208 --> 22:09.167
just to throw it back in my face
like that.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.708
- Get your feet off the table.
- Or what?

22:14.792 --> 22:17.583
- Sure you don't want a little bit?
- No, I don't.

22:19.208 --> 22:22.000
- Can't stay for long.
- I'll stay as long as I want.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.750
It's my house.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.667
Hm, I was here before you, though,
weren't I?

22:32.917 --> 22:34.833
- I pay the rent.
- Hm.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.000
See how long that lasts.

23:28.333 --> 23:31.375
Agh!
Stupid thing!

23:31.500 --> 23:33.333
- What you done to it?
- Nothing.

23:33.458 --> 23:36.500
I just put it on like normal
and it started flooding out everywhere.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.750
Who even said that you could use
the bloomin' washing machine?

23:39.875 --> 23:42.083
- I did. Watch your tone!
- Watch yours!

23:42.208 --> 23:45.583
- Either get out or help!
- Oh, God!

23:45.708 --> 23:49.167
Right, come on, get that in the wash.
You've been wearing it since I got here.

23:49.292 --> 23:51.583
- No!
- Come on, it stinks.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.417
If I have to.

23:59.667 --> 24:01.792
That is mad comfy in there!

24:07.542 --> 24:09.875
Obviously, though,
you share, like, apartments, innit?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.667
There's probably, like, four or five of us.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.542
Share a kitchen, got a nice little pool.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.833
- You're living with your boys?
- Yeah, it's sick.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.208
Go on.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.792
That was sick!

24:22.917 --> 24:24.333
That was sick.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.500
- Do you speak Spanish, then?
- Mm-hm.

24:30.292 --> 24:33.167
Yeah, a little bit.
Understand most of it.

24:33.292 --> 24:35.333
- Is it better over there?
- Yeah.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.792
Yeah, it's hot. Food's better.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.417
Beaches, girls,
you know what I'm saying?

24:46.292 --> 24:47.667
Better than home?

24:47.792 --> 24:49.750
Yeah. Yeah.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.833
So, it's alright
to just leave people behind, is it?

24:52.958 --> 24:56.792
You never thought that leaving someone
to raise a child on their own was a bit...

24:56.917 --> 24:58.417
selfish?

25:00.375 --> 25:03.958
I'm just... gonna go
on my evening walk.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.167
Your mum never wanted me around,
you know?

25:11.792 --> 25:14.542
- She said that, did she?
- I knew it.

25:14.667 --> 25:18.125
Even so, most dads send money
every now and then.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.208
Help out. We ain't exactly
been rolling in it, have we?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.125
I ain't rolling in it myself, am I?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.583
This job you've got, is it a normal job
for a 30-year-old man?

25:28.708 --> 25:32.000
- Yes, there's loads of people my age...
- Then what are you here for now?

25:32.125 --> 25:34.792
I told you. I heard about your mum passing
and I wanted to get to know you.

25:34.917 --> 25:36.417
After 12 years?

25:36.542 --> 25:39.167
How come you didn't want
to know me 12 years ago?

25:39.292 --> 25:41.167
Because we were young,
like we weren't getting along.

25:41.292 --> 25:44.292
- She told me to leave.
- You're a liar!

25:44.417 --> 25:47.250
I ain't surprised no one's stuck around
for you, you know that?

25:51.458 --> 25:54.458
Think you can just turn up with some
flowers, say you're sorry about my mum

25:54.583 --> 25:56.208
and it'll all be alright?

25:56.333 --> 25:57.458
It ain't.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.375
Do you think he'll stay?

27:14.500 --> 27:16.208
I don't care.

27:22.458 --> 27:24.417
I think he will.

27:30.958 --> 27:33.667
Would probably be best
if he does, right?

27:33.792 --> 27:35.250
Why?

27:41.458 --> 27:43.333
You can't...

27:44.458 --> 27:46.417
You can't keep living by yourself.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.958
Why can't I? I'm doing fine.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.958
Not that one.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.792
Not that one, either.

28:09.792 --> 28:11.917
Put it back! Move out the way.

28:20.042 --> 28:22.958
Here you go, nice simple mug for ya.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.875
Alright, cheers.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.833
Uh! That's off!

28:31.792 --> 28:34.417
- Do you want anything from the shop?
- No.

28:38.458 --> 28:39.792
Don't move.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.208
Hello?

28:43.875 --> 28:45.042
Oh, hello, Sian.

28:45.792 --> 28:49.917
Yeah, no, I've got a cold at the minute
so my voice is a bit... tickly.

28:50.042 --> 28:51.292
Yeah.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.583
Georgie's doing alright, yeah.
Aren't you, Georgie?

28:56.583 --> 28:58.458
Yeah, she's good.

29:00.208 --> 29:03.292
Yeah, no, we're just having
a nice breakfast together, actually.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.583
Alright, well,
thanks for checking in.

29:06.708 --> 29:09.000
Actually, Sian, should I, er...

29:09.125 --> 29:12.167
Should I give you my new mobile number
in case you need anything?

29:13.667 --> 29:15.875
Yeah, it's 07984.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.708
639.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.042
364.

29:20.917 --> 29:22.375
Cheers, Sian.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.375
Alright.

29:28.042 --> 29:30.917
I'll have to meet this
Uncle Winston Churchill at some point.

29:32.375 --> 29:35.917
Remember, I can tell the Social whenever
I want, so drop the attitude, yeah?

29:37.583 --> 29:38.917
Yeah?

29:41.042 --> 29:42.625
Back in a bit.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.875
New milk.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.250
How was your porridge?

30:43.917 --> 30:45.917
What's that job you said you did again?

30:47.417 --> 30:49.750
Ticket selling in Ibiza.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.125
Right.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.083
Is there any, like...

30:59.083 --> 31:00.917
...dangers in Ibiza?

31:02.750 --> 31:04.625
Not really, no.

31:05.833 --> 31:09.083
Alright. I'm off to work.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.458
"Ticket sales.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.292
"A representative
or a rep for a nightclub

31:20.417 --> 31:23.375
"who sells tickets to holidaymakers."

31:24.583 --> 31:27.042
Maybe it's slang
for something?

31:27.917 --> 31:32.125
- You think he's planning to kill you?
- I don't think so.

31:32.250 --> 31:35.583
Why wouldn't he have done it already?
Bit stupid not to.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.208
Likes to toy with his prey?

32:09.792 --> 32:11.625
You gotta scratch the serial numbers off.

32:11.750 --> 32:15.750
- What?
- You gotta get the serial numbers off.

32:15.875 --> 32:18.500
Otherwise the police will track them
back to the bikes that've been nicked.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.042
Look.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.458
Feel.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.583
Even when you paint 'em,
you can still feel 'em.

32:32.292 --> 32:35.042
Look, scratch 'em off.

32:35.167 --> 32:37.667
- Oh, yeah!
- Then they won't get tracked back.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.958
Yeah? Go on, give that a go, bruv.

32:44.042 --> 32:45.792
Who says the bikes are stolen?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.500
Ali. Ali.

32:59.625 --> 33:00.875
Ali!

33:02.042 --> 33:04.875
- We need to check his phone.
- What?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.458
Jason, we need to check his phone.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.125
Come on.

33:18.375 --> 33:21.458
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

34:00.667 --> 34:02.417
It's nothing mad.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.500
You can take it back now, you know.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.167
Look.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.667
It's not like you're naked
in the bath, is it?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.917
What do you think you're doing?

34:17.042 --> 34:18.708
- Just...
- You just what?

34:18.833 --> 34:21.500
You think you can go through my stuff?
You don't do that!

34:22.542 --> 34:24.583
- What's on your phone?
- That's nothing to do with you.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.250
You don't even know me.

34:27.333 --> 34:30.417
What you doing here again?
You not got your own home?

34:30.542 --> 34:32.292
I'll leave if you want me to.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.208
- Whatever.
- Right, shut up now!

35:20.042 --> 35:22.125
'Georgie, please get that camera
out of my face!

35:22.250 --> 35:24.792
- 'What is wrong with you? Turn it round.'
- 'Nah!'

35:24.917 --> 35:28.583
- 'That day five of those pyjamas?'
- 'What was that?'

35:28.708 --> 35:30.375
- 'Day five with no shower?'
- 'Huh?'

35:30.500 --> 35:32.625
- 'Can smell you a mile off!'
- 'Excuse me!

35:32.750 --> 35:34.958
'Shall we tell the camera
what I've just pulled out of your hair?

35:35.083 --> 35:37.750
'Shall we tell them?
A nice big juicy nit!'

35:37.875 --> 35:40.208
'I probably got them from you,
anyway.'

35:41.583 --> 35:43.000
'No, you didn't!

35:43.125 --> 35:45.792
'Get it out, please. You're grounded.'

35:58.750 --> 36:01.083
Well, he's obviously hiding
something.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.833
No, he ain't.

36:04.833 --> 36:07.292
Did you see how he reacted?

36:07.417 --> 36:10.417
Well, maybe he just wants some privacy,
like you do.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.875
Oh, don't be stupid, Ali.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.875
What is wrong with you?
Everyone's out to get you, ain't they?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.792
The world revolves around Georgie.
You can trust people, you know.

36:19.917 --> 36:22.250
He's being nice.
At least he's here now.

36:23.417 --> 36:25.833
What are you being
such a little victim for, you idiot?

36:26.625 --> 36:29.875
Ever since he got here,
you've just been a beg friend to him.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.458
I'm meant to be your mate.

36:31.583 --> 36:33.417
You can have more than one mate,
you know.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.458
Go on, then, go and be his mate.
I don't need you anymore.

36:39.875 --> 36:42.042
- I will.
- Good.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.208
Go. I've got other mates.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.542
Absolutely not!

36:48.375 --> 36:49.375
Oh, God!

36:49.500 --> 36:51.250
What, a friend?

36:51.375 --> 36:54.583
What, me and her?
Nah, man. She's a little girl.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.708
More of an acquaintance, really.

36:56.833 --> 36:59.708
- Wouldn't you say?
- Distant acquaintance.

36:59.833 --> 37:02.042
She just doesn't deserve
to be my friend.

37:35.375 --> 37:37.750
- You alright, Georgie?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.500
- You alright?
- Mm-hm.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.042
Do you want a... want a hug or...?

37:42.167 --> 37:44.958
- I'm alright, thanks.
- Yeah. Probably...

37:52.250 --> 37:53.750
Here you go.

37:56.625 --> 37:58.375
Alright.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.542
Five quid and I'll...
I'll use it for parts.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.792
- Ten.
- Five.

38:03.917 --> 38:06.375
- Fine.
- Where's Ali?

38:07.083 --> 38:08.750
Fell out.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.667
- Can I stay in here and work with you...?
- No, not today.

38:12.792 --> 38:16.125
- I don't wanna be paid or nothing.
- Look, just jog on, man, please.

38:17.125 --> 38:19.500
- OK.
- Alright.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.333
And I understand that she's sad.

38:40.458 --> 38:43.792
Obviously, I get that,
but what are we meant to do?

38:43.917 --> 38:48.083
And it's never really like this.
We fall out once a year, maybe.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.333
Yeah, this time it's different.

38:52.083 --> 38:55.000
So, how long has...
How long has it been, then? What, like...?

38:55.958 --> 38:58.208
Probably, like, couple of hours, I think.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.417
Yeah.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.875
Just give it time, innit?
I don't know, just...

39:08.625 --> 39:09.625
Yeah.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.167
You alright?

39:18.292 --> 39:21.750
I, um... I cooked, and then Ali turned up.

39:21.875 --> 39:25.000
Something about you two having a spat.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.500
Come on, sit down.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.208
Go on, plonk yourself down.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.833
I made some dinner, look.

39:36.833 --> 39:40.000
- Er... It's quite spicy.
- Yeah, I know.

39:40.125 --> 39:43.542
I put some, um, chilli powder
and tarragon in it.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.167
That was all you had
in the cupboards, but...

39:48.083 --> 39:50.833
I think it... I think it works.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.250
Mm. How was school?

39:58.708 --> 40:00.375
It's the school holidays.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.292
What?

40:12.417 --> 40:16.083
- No?
- That ain't funny!

40:16.208 --> 40:20.000
That's not my fault.
That must've been loose already.

40:22.292 --> 40:24.542
That's my mum. We're going caravan.

40:28.708 --> 40:30.458
Yeah? Oh.

40:31.625 --> 40:33.333
A-ha! Who's this?

40:33.458 --> 40:36.042
- Jason.
- Georgie's dad.

40:36.542 --> 40:39.292
Oh, you didn't mention he was around.

40:39.417 --> 40:42.042
Yeah, he's here now
instead of her uncle.

40:42.167 --> 40:44.917
Right. I don't think we have met.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.083
No. No, we ain't. Jason. You alright?

40:47.208 --> 40:48.292
- Jason?
- Mm-hm.

40:48.417 --> 40:52.667
- I don't remember Vicky mentioning you.
- Oh, I've been working abroad.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.833
- OK. Back now, then?
- For a bit. Yeah.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.833
Good.

41:01.958 --> 41:05.000
Georgie!
What happened with your tooth?

41:05.125 --> 41:08.167
Oh, it fell out. His burnt garlic bread.

41:09.542 --> 41:12.042
She'll be alright, it was loose anyway.
She'll be alright.

41:12.958 --> 41:14.917
OK, get your stuff, huh?

41:15.875 --> 41:18.125
- Alright, Jason. I'll see you again.
- Yeah.

41:18.833 --> 41:21.375
- I'll be here, yeah. Nice to meet ya.
- Yeah, good. OK.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.208
- Enjoy the caravan.
- It was interesting to meet you.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.208
- Yeah, yeah. Enjoy your trip.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.708
- Yeah, we will, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:48.208 --> 41:52.458
'...year guarantee. Of course, two years,
just like everything else we sell.

41:52.583 --> 41:55.042
- 'Highly recommended.'
- 'It's a no-quibble guarantee?

41:55.167 --> 41:57.750
'No problems at all, whatever happens,
you get your money back?'

41:57.875 --> 41:59.333
'Exactly...'

42:40.042 --> 42:41.833
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

42:42.458 --> 42:46.083
- What you awake for?
- You nicking my money?

42:46.792 --> 42:48.458
What? No!

42:55.708 --> 42:57.667
I was looking for your tooth.

42:58.458 --> 43:01.250
Why would I put my teeth
underneath my pillow?

43:02.458 --> 43:04.667
- For the tooth fairy.
- What?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.417
Put your tooth under the pillow,

43:07.542 --> 43:10.292
then the tooth fairy gives you
a couple of quid, don't she?

43:10.417 --> 43:11.542
Does she?

43:12.458 --> 43:14.167
Yeah.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.792
- She's never done that before.
- Really?

43:18.792 --> 43:21.083
She must owe me, like, 20 quid, then.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.250
Right, well, you might as well have it
now. There you are.

43:26.833 --> 43:30.250
- I don't want your money.
- What?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.833
I don't want your money.

43:36.208 --> 43:37.792
Alright.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.708
You going out to work?

43:54.208 --> 43:55.958
Without Ali?

44:01.875 --> 44:03.667
Do you want me
to come give you a hand?

44:14.833 --> 44:18.417
- Hurry up.
- Come on, do your job properly.

44:18.542 --> 44:21.833
What? What do you think I'm doing?
I'm looking out.

44:21.958 --> 44:23.958
- Hm?
- I'm watching, innit?

44:26.167 --> 44:29.417
- What you doing, trying to pick it?
- What do you think I'm doing?

44:29.542 --> 44:32.208
- Get an allen key on the seat.
- Do it, then.

44:32.333 --> 44:33.500
- Quickly!
- Alright.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.000
- Calm down.
- Do you want me to do it?

44:36.833 --> 44:38.208
There you go.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.708
- You're proper longing it out, ain't ya?
- Give me the bolt cutters.

44:41.833 --> 44:43.292
- I was literally just about to do that.
- No, you wasn't.

44:43.417 --> 44:44.750
- Quickly.
- Yes, I was.

44:44.875 --> 44:47.333
Bloody hell, how many tools
do you really need?

44:47.458 --> 44:49.333
Oi!

44:49.458 --> 44:51.792
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oi! Come here!

44:51.917 --> 44:53.417
Yeah, in pursuit now.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.167
Ooh! Sorry!

45:14.167 --> 45:16.000
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

45:17.875 --> 45:19.500
Go down there.

45:22.792 --> 45:25.208
- You see how slow they were!
- Shut up! It ain't funny!

45:25.333 --> 45:27.625
Can you stop laughing?

45:27.750 --> 45:29.750
You sound like a pig.

46:20.500 --> 46:23.583
- Want a bit of water in there?
- What is it? There's all clumps in it.

46:23.708 --> 46:25.708
- Huh?
- I'm trying to get the clumps out.

46:25.833 --> 46:28.417
Well, that will help, won't it?
There you go.

46:28.542 --> 46:31.750
No, I don't need your tea water
in my hot chocolate.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.208
- You seen my phone?
- No.

46:37.333 --> 46:38.708
Are you sure?

46:38.833 --> 46:40.458
I haven't seen it.

46:50.042 --> 46:51.792
Nah, don't go in my bag.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.875
Get out my bag now.

47:00.417 --> 47:01.750
Can't find it.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.667
Might have fallen out your pocket
when you were running?

47:03.792 --> 47:05.958
- Which one was it in?
- This one.

47:06.083 --> 47:07.667
- Is there zips on it?
- No.

47:07.792 --> 47:09.042
That's long gone, then.

47:09.167 --> 47:11.375
That's your fault, that is.
You're the one that made us run like that.

47:11.500 --> 47:14.875
- It was run or get arrested, Georgie.
- You were fiddling about with the bikes!

47:15.000 --> 47:16.375
- You drew attention to us.
- No.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.708
It was probably your speed
that messed us up.

47:43.042 --> 47:44.875
'Why you filming me?'

47:56.292 --> 47:57.875
'Why you filming me?'

48:03.583 --> 48:04.250
'Why you filming me?'

48:05.208 --> 48:06.500
What you looking for?

48:11.250 --> 48:14.125
- What you looking for?
- What do you care?

48:14.250 --> 48:16.042
I dunno.

48:17.792 --> 48:20.750
- Just my phone.
- Your phone?

48:21.625 --> 48:23.625
What are you so upset about that for?

48:23.750 --> 48:25.417
Just ask for a new one.

48:25.542 --> 48:28.583
- Shut up, you don't get it.
- Get what? It's just a phone!

48:28.708 --> 48:31.333
- No, it's not.
- What are you being stupid for?

48:31.458 --> 48:33.250
Shut up!

50:56.875 --> 50:58.625
- Georgie?
- Oi!

50:58.750 --> 51:00.417
- What do you think you're doing?
- Bringing you this.

51:04.083 --> 51:08.042
What were you doing in there?
Playing secret games or something?

51:09.625 --> 51:11.208
Don't worry.

51:14.083 --> 51:16.083
Do you wanna go out for the day?

51:16.208 --> 51:18.292
Come on, a little adventure! It'll be fun.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.500
- Can't.
- Can't?

51:21.625 --> 51:25.000
Why not, you busy?
Got big plans, have ya?

51:25.125 --> 51:28.417
Georgie! Georgie, open up!

51:29.042 --> 51:30.917
No, no, no, no.

51:32.333 --> 51:34.625
You really hurt Layla.

51:34.750 --> 51:37.125
Georgie!

51:37.250 --> 51:39.542
Don't answer,
don't answer.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.458
I know you're living here
by yourself.

51:46.167 --> 51:47.958
Georgie!

51:48.083 --> 51:51.083
- Don't. Please don't answer.
- Georgie, will you open this door?

51:51.208 --> 51:53.417
- Don't answer, please.
- I'm losing my patience here.

51:55.792 --> 51:58.042
- Let's nip out the back.
- Come on, will you come to the door?

51:58.167 --> 51:59.500
Get low, though. Duck down.

52:21.833 --> 52:23.958
Me and your mum used
to play this game, yeah,

52:24.083 --> 52:28.083
where you, like, pick people having
a conversation then you have it for them.

52:28.208 --> 52:31.167
You know, make up
a little story for them?

52:31.292 --> 52:34.417
Here you are, look.
Look at these two over here. There.

52:34.542 --> 52:38.917
Let's just assume they're a couple.
I'll be the guy, you be the woman, yeah?

52:41.917 --> 52:45.625
My God!
This sandwich is bloody delightful!

52:50.458 --> 52:52.750
- What?
- Do her.

52:54.667 --> 52:57.292
To think it was only £10.

52:58.125 --> 53:01.708
Well... £10 isn't much to me!

53:02.333 --> 53:04.000
Pocket change, darling.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.375
Go on.

53:10.167 --> 53:13.792
Darling, we need to discuss
and talk about your job.

53:16.208 --> 53:17.417
What about my job?

53:18.667 --> 53:20.833
There's not enough money
for the plants.

53:20.958 --> 53:22.750
Sandra, I'm not going through this again!

53:22.875 --> 53:26.708
It's all getting too much!
Your spending's out of control.

53:26.833 --> 53:29.250
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!

53:29.875 --> 53:31.750
Patrick, I...

53:31.875 --> 53:34.708
I've only spent £10,000
in the last month.

53:34.833 --> 53:39.000
Last year it was the dogs and this year
it's the garden. I just can't keep up.

53:39.125 --> 53:41.250
- Do you think I go to work every day...
- Patrick!

53:41.375 --> 53:43.667
No, Sandra, you listen to me.

53:44.917 --> 53:49.667
If you really must know
why I'm spending so much on the plants,

53:49.792 --> 53:53.083
then... it's...

53:53.208 --> 53:55.792
Oh, you're going to cry now, are you?

53:55.917 --> 53:58.625
Typical! Typical Sandra!

54:00.417 --> 54:05.208
It's because, well,
Vera... Vera and Peter,

54:05.333 --> 54:08.167
they keep looking over the fence,
giving dirty looks going...

54:08.292 --> 54:10.500
- Oh!
- Every day!

54:10.625 --> 54:13.542
- Again with the comparisons?
- Every day, about five times a day!

54:13.667 --> 54:15.917
- Their garden is beautiful!
- So is ours!

54:16.042 --> 54:19.583
They have yellow,
white and purple, pink...

54:19.708 --> 54:22.167
- Ours is lovely, darling.
- ...green flowers.

54:22.292 --> 54:25.208
- And we have nothing!
- We have everything you've ever wanted.

54:25.333 --> 54:27.500
- They have a small lake!
- Oi, mate!

54:27.625 --> 54:30.125
We can hear you, yeah?
Don't take the mick.

54:33.250 --> 54:34.417
Oops.

54:37.208 --> 54:39.333
Disgusting here, it stinks.

54:40.208 --> 54:43.125
- It's where I grew up.
- The countryside?

54:43.250 --> 54:44.833
Mm.

54:44.958 --> 54:48.333
Right, so listen, how it works.

54:48.458 --> 54:51.583
Hover it above the ground,
and then when the signal beeps loudest,

54:51.708 --> 54:54.208
it'll be, like, "Beep!"
then you, like, know where to dig up.

54:54.333 --> 54:57.208
- That's where it'll be.
- Really? Oh, that's amazing, you know.

54:57.333 --> 55:00.333
- I'd love to know more.
- Oh, yeah. OK.

55:00.458 --> 55:02.083
Look at this. Oi!

55:04.125 --> 55:07.167
Look at that.
I found that when I was younger.

55:09.583 --> 55:11.625
It's in proper good nick and all.

55:14.708 --> 55:16.292
Sick, innit?

55:25.167 --> 55:27.208
Georgie!

55:27.333 --> 55:29.250
- What?
- Quickly.

55:29.375 --> 55:31.792
That's beeping like mad, go on.

55:31.917 --> 55:33.958
- There's something there.
- Take that.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.625
- What is it?
- A bracelet.

55:39.417 --> 55:41.417
Yeah? Does it say anything on it?

55:42.625 --> 55:44.958
Nah? What a coincidence!

55:47.583 --> 55:50.333
- Happy birthday.
- It's not my birthday.

55:50.958 --> 55:54.625
Nah, I know, but it's, like,
for the ones I've missed and that.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.750
- You want me to put it on for ya?
- Mm.

56:11.833 --> 56:13.000
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

56:13.125 --> 56:16.792
- That looks good, that. You like it?
- Mm-hm.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.375
Right, see, er, that's a penny.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.417
Look, there's so many nice little things,
bits and bobs, that need...

56:23.542 --> 56:26.583
- I mean, they need a good scrub, but...
- The pennies do.

56:26.708 --> 56:28.833
The pennies do, but sometimes...

56:28.958 --> 56:31.667
You know, sometimes you can get
good money for them as well.

56:32.500 --> 56:35.083
Yeah, that one's very dirty,
that one.

56:35.208 --> 56:38.208
It looks like a stone, but it's not,
you can tell it's a coin.

56:38.333 --> 56:40.000
- Yeah.
- Actually, it's a bit smaller.

56:40.125 --> 56:42.125
It might be a stone.

56:42.250 --> 56:45.250
Well, look, see these things here?
The brackets.

56:46.750 --> 56:49.750
I'm thinking
I'll do you a nice little shelf.

56:51.292 --> 56:53.458
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

56:53.583 --> 56:55.500
There you go, keep 'em there.

56:56.208 --> 56:59.208
Keep... Keep 'em there.
Straight.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.708
OK, yeah?

57:08.292 --> 57:10.000
No, but you're cheating, though.

57:10.125 --> 57:11.750
- How is that cheating?
- You've gotta keep your hand there.

57:13.667 --> 57:15.750
- Wait, you're running, you're running.
- I'm not.

57:15.875 --> 57:18.042
- You're running. Cheat, cheat, cheat.
- I'm just walking.

57:18.167 --> 57:19.375
Cheat, bruv, cheat.

57:20.958 --> 57:22.667
Alright, the dance is...

57:31.458 --> 57:34.250
- No, you don't put the hand on your hip.
- No hand? Just...

57:34.792 --> 57:36.958
- No! You're still putting it on your hip.
- Sorry!

57:37.083 --> 57:38.500
- You gotta put it down the side.
- I can't help it.

57:38.625 --> 57:40.667
- I can't help with the old...
- No, you...

57:40.792 --> 57:42.125
Just keep it there.

57:48.625 --> 57:51.167
- No, you've gotta keep bopping.
- Why have I gotta keep bopping...

57:51.292 --> 57:53.167
- Cos you don't know how to style it out.
- ...and you stop?

57:53.292 --> 57:55.958
- You just stop when you want.
- No, you don't know how to style it out.

57:56.083 --> 57:57.750
One rule for you,
different for me, innit?

57:57.875 --> 57:59.125
No.

57:59.250 --> 58:01.250
- Actually, yes.
- Yeah!

58:01.750 --> 58:03.375
Do you have to do that?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.500
- No.
- That's what you did.

58:06.625 --> 58:10.042
- No, it's not. It's really not.
- It is. You went...

58:12.292 --> 58:13.708
Like that.

58:17.417 --> 58:18.625
That's what I done.

58:23.208 --> 58:25.500
- You've already done it wrong.
- I got the lyrics wrong.

58:25.625 --> 58:28.333
- Ah, the pressure! The pressure!
- Are you ready?

58:28.458 --> 58:30.583
- Back down on your knees, come on.
- The pressure's too much!

58:31.417 --> 58:32.875
You've gotta learn this.

58:33.625 --> 58:35.667
Go, go. Tap.

58:37.625 --> 58:39.875
OK. Tres, dos, uno...

58:41.958 --> 58:43.833
♪ Rain falls

58:43.958 --> 58:45.625
♪ Night time

58:45.750 --> 58:47.333
♪ Inside... ♪

58:47.458 --> 58:49.125
- That was it.
- That was shocking.

58:49.250 --> 58:50.792
- Shocking?
- Yeah.

58:55.875 --> 59:01.083
- What was your mum like?
- She's a good mum.

59:01.708 --> 59:04.833
Strict at times,
but she's a good mum.

59:08.750 --> 59:10.625
What was yours like?

59:11.667 --> 59:15.625
- You knew her.
- Yeah, but, like, not as a mum.

59:20.083 --> 59:22.833
Funny. Moany.

59:22.958 --> 59:25.583
She definitely wouldn't have
liked metal detecting.

59:25.708 --> 59:27.708
Nah, she wouldn't have.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.500
Took her go-karting once for my birthday
and she... she weren't having it.

59:32.625 --> 59:34.708
Stormed off, walked all the way home.

59:39.167 --> 59:43.500
What was you like as a kid?
Bet you were a proper wrong'un.

59:43.625 --> 59:45.958
Proper geek like metal detecting
on the regs.

59:48.417 --> 59:50.583
No, no, no.
Nah, I was proper cool.

59:53.917 --> 59:55.750
You don't look very cool.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.000
Bet you was proper full of yourself,
spoilt brat with loads of annoying mates.

01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:16.375
It's the Social.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.458
Don't answer.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.625
I recognise their number.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.375
Decline it.

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:35.292
Hey!

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:38.375
There y'are, look.
Didn't have a lighter.

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:42.208
- Thought you were going a wee.
- I did both.

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:44.125
- Wash your hands?
- Yes.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.167
- Soap, the whole shebang?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:50.500
- Wanna blow them out?
- There's nothing to...

01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:53.542
I know.
Just do like a little pretend like...

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:56.458
- You're not going to sing or...?
- No.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.667
That's it. You missed one.

01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:03.667
That's it.
You wanna make a wish?

01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:05.125
OK.

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.625
- What d'you wish for?
- I'm not gonna tell you, am I?

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.875
Club doors are open.
Club doors shut.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.875
Someone's gone out for a fag.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:33.500
How do I...?
How do I do that one?

01:01:33.625 --> 01:01:37.417
- You just open and shut doors?
- What, continuously or...?

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.292
See you in a bit.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.042
Alright.

01:02:22.667 --> 01:02:26.208
- You alright?
- Sit down a minute.

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:30.333
- What, here?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:41.417
You know earlier?

01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:45.708
- When I said I fell?
- Yeah.

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.833
- I didn't.
- Well, yeah.

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.042
I knew that.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.625
I got into a fight with this girl.

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:04.083
Beat her up.

01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:06.875
And her parents know it was me.

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:14.417
Are you angry at me?

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:17.292
- No.
- Promise?

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:22.125
- I promise.
- What if I'm in proper trouble?

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.417
What if they call the police
or my school?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.583
- I'll sort it.
- How?

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.208
Don't worry.

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:39.125
Let me sort it.

01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:09.583
- Yeah?
- You alright? Er, sorry to bother ya.

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:12.333
- I'm Georgie's dad, Jason.
- Oh, you're Georgie's dad?

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:16.042
- Yeah, yeah. How's your girl doing?
- Have you seen what your kid's done?

01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:18.667
Layla?

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.750
Look at her face.
She's proper shaken-up.

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:25.167
Ah, she'll be alright.
Kids will be kids, won't they?

01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:28.542
Get back inside. That's no excuse.
You need to check your kid.

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:34.583
OK. Listen, I just came
to give you that and say sorry.

01:04:35.292 --> 01:04:38.167
You think
that's the right thing to do?

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:42.375
- Have you even asked her why she did it?
- She's fine. She had a moment.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.250
She definitely ain't fine.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.000
Right.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.750
I hope she's alright.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.000
Did you go out last night?

01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:12.792
Where'd you go?

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:15.583
Oh, I'm jealous!

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.707
Ah, it's rainy and grim.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.332
Yeah, was it a mad night, yeah?

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.625
Did he? Ah, swear down,
he's such a mess!

01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:26.207
'Jason, I have been
calling you for weeks.

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.500
'I know this is still your number.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:34.125
'Same old selfish Jay,
running away from his responsibilities.

'The doctor said I've got weeks.

'I can't leave my Georgie on her own.

'You're the only person I can ask.

01:09:48.457 --> 01:09:51.082
'You're the only person
who might love her like I do.

01:09:56.083 --> 01:10:00.833
'Georgie is... Georgie.

'I've had to tell her
I'm going up to the sky, but...

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.500
'...she's not stupid enough
to believe that.

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:12.125
'I just don't really know
what else to say.'

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.458
- Was that actually me?
- I think so, yeah.

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:15.583
Yeah, I think so.

01:10:15.708 --> 01:10:17.458

what's going on, though.

'I catch her looking at me sometimes.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:26.208
'She's one of a kind.

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:31.500
'God, she's a proper little weirdo!

01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:41.042
'She's got my washing machine on 24/7
with muddy clothes.

01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:45.583
'She's probably doing
just as bad at school as you.

01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:49.083
'She just has constant arguments
with her teachers.

01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:55.000
'It's actually crazy
how much she's like you.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:11:01.167
'But me and Georgie,
we've done so good on our own.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:04.125
'She's my best friend.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:09.333

gonna need you, Jay.

a part of you that wants to love her.

Yeah, man.
You're the one that asked to join in.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.875
Yeah, one sec.

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:11.083
- Want to take his place?
- Yeah.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.875
Why did you leave?

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:27.125
Look, I wanted to tell you the truth
about the voicemail.

01:14:28.083 --> 01:14:29.625
But I just...

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.542
I couldn't face it.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.333
Listen, what you gotta understand
about me and your mum

01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:43.167
is that we were so young
when we had you.

01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:45.417
Like we were kids, it was a mess.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.417
But you didn't even try.

01:14:52.042 --> 01:14:54.500
- Why didn't you try?
- I did try.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:56.917
I promise I tried,
I'm just not good at it.

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:07.792
Didn't get very far.

01:15:11.667 --> 01:15:13.292
No, I know.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:17.292
I know, I didn't want to.

01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:26.750
I don't know, I feel like
you don't need me, you know?

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:33.583
I didn't think I needed you.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.750
Do you then, or...?

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:45.000
Now that I know you,
I can't really not know you.

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.750
I don't need you to replace Mum.

01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:56.208
But I need someone.

01:16:08.292 --> 01:16:09.833
OK.

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:12.708
Yeah, deal.

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:17.875
I'm gonna mess up a lot, though.

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.667
So will I.

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:23.875
OK.

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:36.125
So... does this mean I have to, like,
change your nappies and that?

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.500
You did try to steal my tooth.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:41.583
- Bit strange, don't you think?
- Hm.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:49.708
Shall we have a cuddle then, or...?

01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:51.583
I don't know.

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.083
Proper one. You're not hugging me!

01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:02.958
Why are you not hugging me properly?

01:17:03.792 --> 01:17:06.750
What's that? That's not a...

01:17:13.125 --> 01:17:16.042
- You wanna hold hands?
- I'm good, thanks.

01:17:16.167 --> 01:17:17.292
Fair enough.

01:17:17.417 --> 01:17:19.417
You need to start cleaning up
after yourself.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:21.292
I'm fed up of cleaning up for ya.

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:23.542
- I am cleaning up after me.
- Like I'm the adult and you're the kid.

01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:25.083
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.625
- I've been cleaning up.
- No, you haven't.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:29.250
- What have I been leaving out?
- You left your onion rings on the table.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:34.375
You haven't washed up your dishes.
You're taking my old bedsheets.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.292
- Yeah, but I'm washing them after.
- No, you're not washing 'em.

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:40.083
- I'm washing 'em!
- I will wash 'em after!

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:41.667
It doesn't matter, does it?

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:45.458
- The paperwork was a nightmare.
- Always is.

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:48.667
It's a real shame.
She was on a good path.

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:51.792
So rude, the pair of them,
and when they're together, it's worse.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.083
It's the worst!

01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:56.333
Now she's just got a dad. It's, like...
Hooray!

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:59.458
- We've all got dads.
- I haven't got a dad.

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:05.000
The black eye got me two weeks
off school. Which was cool.

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:08.917
Georgie brought me a cake
to say sorry and that.

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:12.125
She's turning up.
At least there's that, you know.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:16.250
She's here, about as much
as you can ask for with a kid like that.

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:17.458
So...

01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:20.583
Well done!
Well done, you.

01:18:20.708 --> 01:18:22.875
Amazing stuff.

01:18:23.792 --> 01:18:26.375
That idiot Jason, he took my bike.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.167
He said he was going to nick it
and it's been two weeks now.

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:31.583
- And he still hasn't given it back.
- Calm down.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.458
And him? Oh, my days!

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:36.667
That hair! What is that hair?
He thinks he's in "8 Mile".

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:42.167
Don't be in a mood with me.

01:18:42.292 --> 01:18:44.000
Well, you didn't let me
choose a thing.

01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:46.667
You've got really bad taste,
you know.

01:18:46.792 --> 01:18:49.875
You can't paint a bloody living room
midnight blue.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.375
Well, he disagreed,
the man in the shop.

01:18:53.417 --> 01:18:55.625
The guy handing out the samples

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:58.542
ain't the guy to be listening to,
alright?

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.875
I've already said
you can paint the bathroom

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.542
- cos no one sees that so it don't matter.
- Oh, shut up!

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:08.000
Yeah!
The colour looks good, you know.

01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:10.583
- I told you.
- Yeah, it looks decent.

01:19:10.708 --> 01:19:12.625
Oh, gotcha.

01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:17.917
It's a bit hard work this, eh?

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:22.458
What you looking at?

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:25.000
I just think maybe
I should get a roller on it.

01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:27.125
It's quicker the way you're doing it.

01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:30.833
I'm gonna be here for ages.

01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:36.333
- You disgust me sometimes.
- I disgust you?

01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:38.542
- Yeah, with your language.
- What did I say?

01:19:38.667 --> 01:19:42.375
- Your fall language.
- What did I...? My 'fall' language?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.250
Yes.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.792
- Hiya.
- Hello, mate.

01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:50.292
What are you still hopping the fence for?
There's a bloody gate there!

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:53.917
Just building my upper body strength,
innit? Get hench or die tryin'!

01:19:54.042 --> 01:19:56.458
Yes, boss. Big man.
I like the trackies.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.917
- Very, er...
- Disgusting.

01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:01.708
It's like... it's like... very formal.

01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:06.042
- My mum made it for me.
- Where you going, to a bloody wedding?

01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:08.583
- Mum made you both something.
- It is a bit wedding vibes.
