TO FEED THEM.

NORMAL,

35:51.731 --> 35:54.604
EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN NORMAL.

35:57.075 --> 35:59.514

STOP RELYING ON SUPPLIES

39:58.424 --> 40:02.699

JUST, STAY HERE AND WAIT

THAT. BUT,

CHANGED THE COURSE OF MANKIND.

HAS FORMED A KIND OF CYCLE

42:13.193 --> 42:17.135
WHICH HELPS TO CREATE LIFE
AND UH,

42:17.235 --> 42:20.141
OBVIOUSLY SOME CASES,
TO DESTROY IT.

42:25.016 --> 42:26.954
PERHAPS THERE IS SO MUCH
DIVERSITY IN LIFE

42:27.054 --> 42:29.726
SIMPLY FOR DISEASE TO EXIST.

42:33.834 --> 42:38.443
WHAT IF MANKIND'S PURPOSE IS
SIMPLY TO EXIST AS A HOST?

42:38.543 --> 42:42.551
JUST A VESSEL. NOTHING
MORE THAN THAT.

43:14.114 --> 43:15.885
- YOU SHOULDN'T
LET HIM GET TO YOU.

43:15.985 --> 43:18.691
- HE DOESN'T.

43:18.791 --> 43:21.463

- LOOK.

43:21.563 --> 43:22.899

HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU TWO

43:22.999 --> 43:24.903
BEFORE I ARRIVED.

43:26.273 --> 43:28.678
I CAN
SEE IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

43:32.117 --> 43:33.788
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

43:43.741 --> 43:47.615
ONE MOMENT YOU'RE A-YOU'RE A
PERSON WITH GOALS

43:47.716 --> 43:49.920
AND PROJECTS.

43:51.323 --> 43:54.329
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU.

43:54.395 --> 43:56.700
PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

43:58.403 --> 44:01.343
AND THEN, IT'S ALL OVER.

44:02.912 --> 44:06.085
I THINK THE PERSON WHO OWNED
THIS HASN'T GOT MUCH USE

44:06.185 --> 44:08.691
FOR IT ANYMORE, DO YOU?

44:12.197 --> 44:14.168
- YOU DO TOO MUCH FOR US.

44:14.268 --> 44:19.379
- WELL, YOU'VE LET ME
STAY HERE WITH YOU.

44:19.479 --> 44:21.817
YOU'VE GIVEN ME YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

44:21.917 --> 44:24.389

THAN YOU NEED US.

44:24.489 --> 44:27.127
