08:37.242 --> 08:38.016
and then I do...

08:38.352 --> 08:40.519
and it kinda blows my mind
all over again.

08:40.595 --> 08:41.578
So good.

08:41.838 --> 08:42.912
Anyway, sorry.
You needed help with something?

08:42.914 --> 08:44.748
Uh, yeah that'd be great.
Come on.

08:44.750 --> 08:45.857
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

08:45.934 --> 08:49.419
No. No. He does not get
to just sashay in here

08:49.421 --> 08:50.270
and have sex with someone

08:50.531 --> 08:52.364
we've all been trying to nail
for years.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.016
Yeah, he has to get in line
and wait like everybody else.

08:55.093 --> 08:56.576
Low rent Shawn White.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.020
Yo. Delores...

08:59.097 --> 09:00.613
I need the key.

09:00.690 --> 09:01.748
Name and time.

09:02.934 --> 09:04.417
[phone ringing]

09:11.034 --> 09:12.592
Connie Lingus?

09:13.461 --> 09:14.427
Real mature!

09:19.451 --> 09:21.134
[Frank] You know what
Mark Twain said?

09:21.210 --> 09:23.544
I'm not 100 percent
on who Mark Twain is.

09:23.546 --> 09:25.288
That's a whole other
conversation now.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.381
He said if you pick up
a starving dog

09:27.459 --> 09:29.568
and make him prosperous,
he will not bite you.

09:29.644 --> 09:33.387
This is the principal difference
between a dog and a man.

09:33.465 --> 09:34.814
Is this about the hot vet?

09:34.891 --> 09:36.515
Yeah, of course
it's about the hot vet.

09:36.593 --> 09:37.742
I've been laying the groundwork
for years.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.987
Do you know how many vaccination
clinics I've volunteered for?

09:41.064 --> 09:42.229
A lot of vaccination clinics.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.066
I've eradicated entire diseases
in pursuit of that woman.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.643
But dude, I'm not, like,
a threat.

09:46.661 --> 09:47.902
I have a girlfriend.

09:47.904 --> 09:50.163
She's a snowboarder,
she's from Spain

09:50.239 --> 09:53.833
and if you'd asked me even
one question you'd know that.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.485
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a relief.

09:55.487 --> 09:58.171
Yeah, and if I was gonna dip
my toe into the work pool,

09:58.323 --> 09:59.580
it wouldn't be the hot vet.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.825
Well, not Victoria.
I got dibs there too.

10:01.827 --> 10:04.661
No. Emily. The boss lady.

10:04.663 --> 10:07.272
She's just so clumsy and
uncomfortable in her own body.

10:07.349 --> 10:10.016
I guess I just dig
an awkward chick.

10:10.018 --> 10:11.592
This is a texture I didn't know
you had.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.520
You see, this partnership...
it's blossoming.

10:14.597 --> 10:18.358
Oh, and I Googled wolves.
They run in packs.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.451
Well, except the lone ones.

10:19.527 --> 10:20.693
Otherwise they would
just be wolves.

10:20.770 --> 10:21.845
And you had to Google that?

10:22.105 --> 10:24.271
There's no shame in admitting
gaps in knowledge.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.032
Unrelated but also
interesting...

10:26.109 --> 10:28.460
did you know snails can have sex
with themselves?

10:47.964 --> 10:50.464
Hi, I'm Emily Price

10:50.542 --> 10:53.818
Wow, that is worse
than I thought.

10:53.895 --> 10:55.545
[clears throat]

10:55.547 --> 10:56.613
I brought muffins.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.218
Hey.

11:02.478 --> 11:04.053
Officers on the scene
with loaded snausages.

11:04.055 --> 11:05.555
[laughing sarcastically]

11:05.999 --> 11:09.167
Never gets old, Tom.
What have we got here?

11:09.244 --> 11:10.693
Waiting for the coroner.

11:10.729 --> 11:13.062
The guy's been dead three days
and no one knew it.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.589
His dog never left his side.

11:15.491 --> 11:17.050
We'll find him a good home.

11:19.829 --> 11:22.422
Three days.
Can you imagine?

11:22.498 --> 11:24.924
Three days without anybody
knowing where I was.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.142
[dog whining]

11:27.746 --> 11:29.429
I'd kill for that.

11:30.098 --> 11:33.066
Hey. Hey, it's gonna be okay.

11:35.378 --> 11:37.987
Charlie. He's so cute!

11:43.261 --> 11:46.596
Whoa.
Those are some tall birds.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.522
Yeah, and their eyes are bigger
than their brains,

11:48.600 --> 11:49.949
so you should feel
right at home.

11:50.026 --> 11:51.358
Your ribbing feels affectionate.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.878
And I know you're going
for more emotional distance.

11:53.955 --> 11:56.956
Hey, your shirt's sticking out.
Let me fix it.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.217
There you go, now
you look respectable.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.720
Look at you taking care
of your partner.

12:01.796 --> 12:03.888
Bonding alert.
Calling all units.

12:03.965 --> 12:04.872
Alright, calm down.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.225
Ma'am, hi. City of Seattle
Animal Control.

12:07.302 --> 12:08.785
Is it alright if we enter?

12:08.787 --> 12:10.377
Make sure to close the gate.

12:11.047 --> 12:12.981
Did my stupid neighbor
call you?

12:14.383 --> 12:15.233
What's going on here?

12:15.551 --> 12:17.961
You making belts or selling
their meat?

12:17.963 --> 12:19.404
I sell the eggs at
the Farmer's Market.

12:19.481 --> 12:20.888
Well, you're gonna need
a license

12:20.907 --> 12:22.223
from the Zoning Commission.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.059
Uh... these guys like me.

12:25.136 --> 12:26.536
Everyone likes you, Shred.

12:27.897 --> 12:29.230
Should I be concerned?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.490
Well, that's really up to you.

12:30.825 --> 12:35.236
They are violent and strong and
have famously bad temperaments.

12:35.313 --> 12:37.589
Oh, and as you can see
they're really fast.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.573
So I would kick it up a gear
if I were you.

12:39.575 --> 12:42.576
In the meantime, I'll just be
writing this citation.

12:42.578 --> 12:45.930
[Shred] It's bad, Frank!
They won't stop.

12:46.007 --> 12:48.433
It's starting to feel
extremely targeted!

12:48.510 --> 12:51.828
Yeah. Well, they either
see you as a food source
or a potential mate.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.680
Either way, I would just
let nature take its course.

12:54.757 --> 12:55.515
[Shred] They're relentless!

12:55.776 --> 12:58.259
But don't worry,
I'm getting all of it.

12:58.336 --> 13:00.520
[Shred yelling in the distance]

13:00.596 --> 13:02.113
Look at 'em move.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.691
These muffins are delicious.
You have to give me the recipe.

13:05.768 --> 13:06.676
Oh, I will.

13:06.861 --> 13:07.677
And you know what?
They're healthy too.

13:08.179 --> 13:10.104
Everyone in my office
has some kind of allergy

13:10.181 --> 13:12.457
so I can never bake
anything fun.

13:12.534 --> 13:13.082
[laughing]

13:14.536 --> 13:15.460
Look, we agree.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.037
We don't wanna turn this
into a big legal thing.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.022
Great. Great.

13:19.024 --> 13:20.356
And... and you have my word,

13:20.358 --> 13:22.634
the City will pay
for everything.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.027
Okay.

13:24.287 --> 13:26.471
If you'll just excuse me, I'm
just gonna let somebody know.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.365
[phone chiming]

[electronic voice]
Emily said they're not
going to sue

and sent a pile of poop emoji...
and a middle finger emoji.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.372
Whatever.

13:36.632 --> 13:39.967
Alright... I won't take up
anymore of your time.

13:40.045 --> 13:41.194
Thank you both.

13:42.471 --> 13:45.657
You didn't use sesame oil
in these, did you?

13:45.733 --> 13:47.400
You know what, I did.

13:47.476 --> 13:49.902
I find it just gives it, like,
a little tang.

13:49.979 --> 13:50.736
[laughs]

13:50.738 --> 13:51.888
Oh God.

13:51.890 --> 13:52.497
I'll get the EpiPen.

13:52.574 --> 13:53.331
Thank you.

13:53.575 --> 13:54.999
Wait, wait...
what's happening?

13:55.076 --> 13:56.576

Call 911.

13:56.652 --> 13:57.727
Right now?

13:57.729 --> 13:59.504
No! Oh, no!

13:59.506 --> 14:00.413
[Shred] Knock it off.

14:00.732 --> 14:03.066
This is not fun for me.
This is not fun.

14:03.068 --> 14:04.067
[woman] I've never seen them
like this.

14:04.069 --> 14:05.159
Little help here, Frank.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.329
Man, they must, uh... smell
something on your clothes.

14:08.331 --> 14:09.906
What kinda detergent do you use?

14:09.908 --> 14:12.684
Tide liquid pods.
They get out anything.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.926
Maybe lose the shirt?

14:14.003 --> 14:15.436
Oh, oh yeah.

14:17.432 --> 14:20.083
[Frank] That is pretty
disrespectful to the uniform.

14:20.085 --> 14:22.268
But you gotta do
what you gotta do.

14:22.921 --> 14:25.922
Hmm.
It's gotta be the pants.

14:25.924 --> 14:27.924
-The pants.
-[Frank] Yeah.

14:27.926 --> 14:29.367
[ostriches chirping]

14:30.111 --> 14:32.945
This is the weirdest strip show
I've ever seen.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.747
And I've seen a number of them.

14:37.526 --> 14:38.459
[ostriches chirping]

14:40.955 --> 14:43.530
Is that your beef stick?

14:43.532 --> 14:46.776
In my defense, uh, I didn't
think it would work that well.

14:46.778 --> 14:49.220
Uncool, bro. Really Uncool!

14:49.297 --> 14:50.871
And I'm sorry to raise my voice
right now

14:50.949 --> 14:52.706
but I'm pretty high up
in this tree

14:52.784 --> 14:54.283
and you crossed a line, brother!

14:54.285 --> 14:56.377
They could've taken my penis,
Frank!

14:56.379 --> 14:59.564
Yeah, but they didn't and that's
what makes it funny.

14:59.641 --> 15:02.291
Dude, I know that the police
department screwed you over

15:02.293 --> 15:04.794
and people let you down
but to learn nothing from that

15:04.796 --> 15:08.314
except to be a jerk, that just
makes you a douche, dude.

15:08.391 --> 15:09.723
You're missing all the nuance.

15:09.725 --> 15:12.744
I'm a douche for a lot
of complicated reasons.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.562
Dude, I blew out my knee three
months before the Olympics.

15:15.564 --> 15:17.823
But I didn't let it make me
hate the world.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.734
We all have a choice in life
and I chose to stay positive.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.587
Well, that just makes me
question your judgment.

15:22.664 --> 15:23.663
Well you'll be proud to know

15:23.924 --> 15:27.091
I'm feeling pretty negative
right now, Frank!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.836
You have a ticket for 600 bucks,
by the way.

-No.

a transfer.

15:39.514 --> 15:41.422
My senior officer,
by word and action,

15:41.499 --> 15:43.683
has made it clear that
he doesn't want me around.

15:43.759 --> 15:46.002
Despite the rumors,
I'm not a people person.

15:46.004 --> 15:48.262
Really? Are you sure?

15:48.264 --> 15:50.189
I'd have to move you to central

the only free truck.

15:54.679 --> 15:55.620
Yes.

15:55.697 --> 15:56.746
You heard the man.

15:58.441 --> 16:01.684
Templeton.
You'd really do that to Shred?

16:01.686 --> 16:02.535
He'll be fine.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.854
He'll be happy in literally
any situation.

Which is the very trait that
makes him challenging for me.

16:07.783 --> 16:10.193
Well, what if you viewed it
as a growth opportunity?

16:10.195 --> 16:11.302
I'm not looking for growth.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.304
If growth wants me bad enough,
it knows where to find me.

Yeah. Alone in your apartment.

16:15.717 --> 16:17.291
Where I am so content.

in a chicken pesto panini?

I wanna say no, but yeah.

Oh, I'm sorry how everything
worked out.

16:48.491 --> 16:49.565
I love Frank

16:49.843 --> 16:51.843
but sometimes he can just be
too much like... Frank.

16:51.919 --> 16:53.160
Yeah.

I really thought I was gonna be
able to crack him, you know?

What are you still doing here?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.999
Oh, we have a pet adoption
coming up

16:59.077 --> 17:00.943
so I was just gonna get
these flyers out.

17:00.945 --> 17:01.744
Cool.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.856
You know, the thing about
snowboarding is

17:04.932 --> 17:06.340
it's a solo sport.

17:06.342 --> 17:07.266
Mmhmm.

17:07.343 --> 17:08.601
Like, when you're on
the mountain

17:08.677 --> 17:09.752
it's just you all alone.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.678
When I got injured nobody
found me for two hours.

17:11.756 --> 17:14.681
What, so the Saint Bernard thing
is a myth?

17:14.759 --> 17:15.867
I'm the wrong guy to ask.

17:15.943 --> 17:17.610
I still sorta believe
in Santa Claus.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.704
What?

17:19.781 --> 17:20.705
Oh.

Do you need a hand?

17:21.933 --> 17:23.449
Um... yeah.

17:23.526 --> 17:26.769
Sorry. Thanks.
I can just be a little clumsy.

17:26.771 --> 17:27.620
I know.

17:27.696 --> 17:28.621
You know, honestly...

I don't know that I'm cut out
for this job.
