WEBVTT

00:00.207 --> 00:01.567
Previously on SWAT...

00:01.591 --> 00:04.389
You're under my direct command now.
No relationships allowed.

00:04.413 --> 00:05.969
You're engaged in unethical conduct.

00:05.993 --> 00:07.387
I wouldn't consider it unethical.

00:07.411 --> 00:08.972
Of course you wouldn't,
but your bosses would.

00:08.996 --> 00:09.995
I'm in the way.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.913
I love you.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.810
I love you, too.

00:13.834 --> 00:16.451
I think it's time
my work family meets you both.

00:16.854 --> 00:18.499
Thanks for always having my six.

00:18.523 --> 00:19.822
Yeah.

00:21.693 --> 00:23.637
This ain't got to be your life.

00:23.661 --> 00:24.672
Don't it?

00:24.696 --> 00:26.928
We both want you to stay here.

00:26.952 --> 00:29.510
You're gonna have to promise
to keep working hard

00:29.534 --> 00:32.345
and promise to stay out of trouble.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.411
I-I promise.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.088
Welcome to the family.

00:41.596 --> 00:44.658
- Got your bus pass?
- Yeah.

00:44.682 --> 00:47.361
- Got money?
- Uh, yeah.

00:47.385 --> 00:49.029
Your phone all charged up?

00:49.053 --> 00:50.197
- Yeah.
- And I know

00:50.221 --> 00:51.865
you got your homework packed up, right?

00:51.889 --> 00:54.034
Come on, stop treating me like
some kid you got to wipe.

00:54.058 --> 00:56.704
Ooh, Lord.
I'm glad I ain't got to do that.

00:57.636 --> 01:00.374
Hey, I know you're happy
about that job you grabbed.

01:00.398 --> 01:01.759
Finding part-time work ain't easy.

01:02.171 --> 01:03.377
Oh, any work.

01:03.401 --> 01:04.712
Darryl,

01:04.736 --> 01:05.879
helping to deliver chips

01:05.903 --> 01:07.348
and pretzels before the sun comes up,

01:07.372 --> 01:08.515
that's just your right now.

01:08.539 --> 01:09.767
That ain't your future, you understand?

01:09.791 --> 01:11.268
So, you handle your business,

01:11.292 --> 01:13.387
but don't you let that truck
make you late for school again.

01:13.411 --> 01:15.022
You stay focused.

01:15.046 --> 01:16.857
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:16.881 --> 01:18.525
My mom's gonna be picking
you up from school,

01:18.549 --> 01:19.777
so don't keep her waiting, you hear me?

01:19.801 --> 01:21.111
Yeah, she's always nice to me.

01:21.135 --> 01:22.396
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.231
- What, I'm not?
- You a'ight.

01:24.255 --> 01:25.616
- "A'ight." Okay.
- No, I...

01:25.640 --> 01:26.900
You know what I'm saying.

01:28.593 --> 01:30.803
Look, I know how hard this
has been for you, Darryl.

01:30.828 --> 01:31.804
Mm-hmm.

01:31.828 --> 01:33.907
And I get that you're
trying, and so am I.

01:33.931 --> 01:36.065
But I think we're making it work.

01:38.152 --> 01:40.914
- Hey, be safe out there.
- I will. Hey.

01:40.938 --> 01:42.466
You better bring me some
of my mama's cookies.

01:42.490 --> 01:43.884
That's only if I don't eat them all.

01:43.908 --> 01:45.469
Boy, you better not.

01:45.493 --> 01:47.159
Hey, I'm serious.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.979
Last of the original
most wanted fugitives.

01:55.003 --> 01:56.930
Hey, Hondo, how long we been staring

01:56.954 --> 01:58.258
at that guy's mug shot on the wall?

01:58.282 --> 02:00.484
Long enough to catch the rest
of Metro's list.

02:00.508 --> 02:02.069
Bakir Hadad, he stays at the top.

02:02.093 --> 02:03.271
We got close to him last year.

02:03.295 --> 02:04.772
Yeah, well, close doesn't qualify.

02:04.796 --> 02:05.823
What's his official body count?

02:05.847 --> 02:07.408
Five down, right? All civilians?

02:07.432 --> 02:08.942
Hadad thought he was taking out
another dealer,

02:08.966 --> 02:11.111
but he hit the wrong house.
North instead of South.

02:11.135 --> 02:12.162
Shot up a whole family.

02:12.186 --> 02:13.447
- Nice.
- Two little kids,

02:13.471 --> 02:15.332
mom, dad, grandma.

02:15.356 --> 02:16.950
And he's been
Metro's Most Wanted ever since.

02:16.974 --> 02:18.919
Swings through L.A.
just long enough to pick up

02:18.943 --> 02:20.454
his dope profits, and then he bounces.

02:20.478 --> 02:21.620
And we finally got lucky.

02:21.644 --> 02:23.040
Yeah, because he got sloppy.

02:23.064 --> 02:24.458
And he doesn't think we can touch him.

02:24.482 --> 02:25.793
Well, pride goeth before destruction

02:25.817 --> 02:27.817
and haughty spirit before a fall.

02:28.786 --> 02:30.464
What? I went to Sunday school.

02:30.488 --> 02:32.099
Best snacks of the week.

02:32.123 --> 02:33.303
Hey, what's going on? I'm working.

02:36.848 --> 02:39.128
Okay, welcome zone straight ahead.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.863 --> 03:02.196
Hondo.

03:04.876 --> 03:06.962
All right, let's make 'em hot.

03:07.658 --> 03:09.503
- Perimeter fully contained?
- 100%, Sergeant.

03:09.527 --> 03:11.138
Undercover unit's got eyes
on the address.

03:11.162 --> 03:12.673
Nobody in, nobody out.

03:12.697 --> 03:13.891
Wait, you didn't evacuate
the entire building?

03:13.915 --> 03:15.858
We were trying to preserve
the element of surprise.

03:15.882 --> 03:17.561
No reason to spook the target
if we didn't have to,

03:17.585 --> 03:18.846
given his history of slipping the grip.

03:18.870 --> 03:20.119
Then let's move.

03:39.774 --> 03:43.526
Hold. Chris, take it out.

03:45.229 --> 03:46.729
Tan, door.

03:50.735 --> 03:52.132
Move.

04:09.303 --> 04:11.448
Sorry.

04:11.472 --> 04:13.400
Well, you'll need an X-ray,
but it looks like nothing worse

04:13.424 --> 04:14.535
than a very bad contusion.

04:14.559 --> 04:15.724
Thank you.

04:17.595 --> 04:20.207
Somebody could think they're
matching up their stories.

04:20.231 --> 04:23.043
Well, they're more worried about
Tan than about how it looks.

04:23.067 --> 04:26.685
Do not discount appearances.
Let's get 'em separated.

04:30.658 --> 04:32.512
I'm not going to ask you what
happened; don't tell me.

04:32.537 --> 04:33.583
I know the drill.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.056
No private conversations with
any member of your team.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.558
Or with any witnesses. I got it.

04:37.582 --> 04:40.093
Not until Force Investigation
finishes your interviews.

04:40.117 --> 04:41.762
- Understood, sir.
- Starting now.

04:41.786 --> 04:43.430
No more talking. Move.

04:43.454 --> 04:45.482
We're waiting for your League
lawyer before F.I.D.

04:45.506 --> 04:47.357
- does the walk-through.
- There's no need.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.234
Lawyers are useful in
a situation like this.

04:49.258 --> 04:51.108
Only if you got something to hide.

04:51.846 --> 04:53.264
Let's just get this over with.

04:53.288 --> 04:55.776
Don't be too proud to protect yourself.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.716
I appreciate the advice, Captain.

05:01.772 --> 05:03.033
- Were you present?
- No.

05:03.057 --> 05:05.752
Luca and I were in apartment 333
handling another suspect.

05:05.776 --> 05:08.255
- How far away?
- Four rooms.

05:08.279 --> 05:09.478
All right.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.345
Look, we did our job, Commander.

05:15.369 --> 05:17.097
I don't have to tell you how
Force Investigation works.

05:17.121 --> 05:18.298
Same old, same old.

05:18.322 --> 05:19.933
Yeah, meaning us versus them, right?

05:19.957 --> 05:21.969
That's not helpful.
It's not even accurate.

05:21.993 --> 05:23.437
We're all on the same side here.

05:23.461 --> 05:24.968
Sure. Until we're not.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.140
They're fact-finders. They ask.

05:27.164 --> 05:30.299
We answer. Simple as that. You copy?

05:35.890 --> 05:37.651
- You okay?
- No.

05:37.675 --> 05:38.819
I don't understand how everything

05:38.843 --> 05:39.953
went sideways like that.

05:39.977 --> 05:41.121
We'll find out.

05:41.145 --> 05:43.540
Street busted his ass
to get back on the team.

05:43.564 --> 05:45.209
You know they're gonna look at him hard.

05:45.233 --> 05:48.484
So they look at him hard.
We're SWAT. We can take review.

05:50.021 --> 05:51.331
Everything you say matters.

05:51.355 --> 05:52.332
How you say it matters.

05:52.356 --> 05:53.500
Think before you answer,

05:53.524 --> 05:55.719
don't guess, and do not volunteer.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.170
- Commander...
- Not even to me.

05:57.194 --> 05:59.006
- Are you listening?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

05:59.030 --> 06:00.507
I hate this as much as you do.

06:00.531 --> 06:03.165
I doubt it. Not with a dead civilian.

06:23.387 --> 06:31.394
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:57.717 --> 07:00.020
How did this even happen? What a mess.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.024
- Do you trust the process?
- No. It involves humans.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.609
You can't predict human behavior.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.062
Except for self-interest.
That's pretty reliable.

07:08.086 --> 07:09.730
You're more cynical than I am.

07:09.754 --> 07:11.399
I'm just a pragmatist.

07:11.423 --> 07:12.945
That's why I'm gonna tell you something.

07:12.969 --> 07:14.148
Good or bad?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.454
You're getting looked at for a promotion.

07:17.629 --> 07:19.957
But a finding of a wrongful
death by one of your teams,

07:19.981 --> 07:22.543
- that could sink it.
- The least of my problems right now.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.845
You're not even curious?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.529
Oh, sure.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.081
Director of Police Operations.

07:28.445 --> 07:30.424
As a real possibility? Real enough.

07:30.448 --> 07:32.509
And that's a straight shot
to deputy chief.

07:32.533 --> 07:35.379
Hell, I'll say it, Jess...
no hiccups, and you could be

07:35.403 --> 07:37.903
the first female wearing
the chief's badge.

07:39.874 --> 07:41.552
Well, you don't look so excited.

07:41.576 --> 07:43.519
All of a sudden, you're scared
of heights in your career?

07:43.543 --> 07:45.556
- No, sir.
- Unless this goes bad, I mean...

07:45.580 --> 07:47.391
You know Hondo. You know this team.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.977
- The truth doesn't fix the optics.
- Okay.

07:50.001 --> 07:51.177
Then there's nothing we can do.

07:51.201 --> 07:54.624
Except worry. My specialty.

08:26.921 --> 08:29.266
For the record, I am Sergeant Nick Boyer,

08:29.290 --> 08:31.602
LAPD Force Investigation Division.

08:31.626 --> 08:33.770
This is the immediate
after-action interview

08:33.794 --> 08:37.241
with LAPD SWAT Sergeant
Daniel Harrelson Jr.,

08:37.265 --> 08:39.443
who has waived legal
representation for this interview.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.613
Time-coded date on this recording.

08:42.996 --> 08:44.357
Morning, Sergeant.

08:44.382 --> 08:45.782
Still morning?

08:46.217 --> 08:48.285
It's been a long day for you
already, I know.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.422
So, the purpose of this
investigation is to determine

08:52.446 --> 08:56.126
if actions by you or your team
caused the death of, uh,

08:56.150 --> 09:01.014
Kayla Gleason, 23,
teacher's aide, residing at...

09:01.038 --> 09:03.300
You get the cause of death yet, Sergeant?

09:03.324 --> 09:07.187
Residing at 4691 Anacapa Avenue,

09:07.211 --> 09:10.274
Apartment 339, Los Angeles.

09:10.298 --> 09:12.693
The preliminary C.O.D. is
blunt force trauma,

09:12.717 --> 09:15.312
which occurred in close
proximity to the stun grenade

09:15.336 --> 09:16.465
deployed during the mission.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.482
You can skip all the passive tenses.

09:18.506 --> 09:20.701
I gave the order to deploy.

09:20.725 --> 09:22.536
I respect how you're taking
responsibility, Sergeant.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.954
For all my team's actions.

09:23.978 --> 09:26.639
But this was a terrible
accident, not a wrongful death.

09:26.663 --> 09:28.709
Why don't we just start at minute one?

09:28.733 --> 09:31.995
You walk me through the mission
from the initial breach point.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.381
We entered the building
through a back courtyard

09:34.405 --> 09:35.688
we accessed from the alley.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.886
Tan, door.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.554
We were serving
a rapid entry warrant against

09:40.578 --> 09:43.674
multiple homicide suspect Bakir Hadad.

09:43.698 --> 09:46.393
And we had a full package
of officers to secure

09:46.417 --> 09:48.345
the interior and exterior.

09:48.369 --> 09:51.574
My team, plus Sergeant
Vandelli's team as backup.

09:56.704 --> 09:58.655
Did you notice Sergeant Harrelson taking

09:58.679 --> 10:00.657
a personal phone call
in the armored vehicle?

10:00.681 --> 10:02.359
What does that have to do with
the events at the building?

10:02.383 --> 10:04.995
Maybe nothing. But it's on the timeline.

10:06.256 --> 10:08.665
We were still in transit.
I understand that.

10:08.689 --> 10:10.367
Did you see the sergeant
answer his phone?

10:12.041 --> 10:13.741
I saw that he was on the phone.

10:13.765 --> 10:15.443
I appreciate your precision.

10:16.127 --> 10:18.268
Did he say anything to you?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.521
It seemed serious.

10:23.308 --> 10:24.836
But you're a cop, Sergeant.

10:25.900 --> 10:26.955
I don't need to tell you

10:26.979 --> 10:29.007
how good we all get
at compartmentalizing.

10:29.031 --> 10:30.435
Not always easy, though.

10:30.459 --> 10:32.510
I didn't notice it had any effect on him,

10:32.534 --> 10:34.095
if that's what you're asking.

10:34.119 --> 10:35.463
Sergeant Harrelson took the lead,

10:35.487 --> 10:37.298
going through the primary door,

10:37.322 --> 10:39.801
which made you number two
right behind him, correct?

10:39.825 --> 10:41.329
- Correct.
- Let's talk about the initial contact

10:41.354 --> 10:42.361
you had with a tenant.

10:42.385 --> 10:45.045
That was my situation,
not Sergeant Harrelson's.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.142
I'm a working parent.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.300
I felt sorry for the mother.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.365
I know how hard it is
to raise a family on a budget.

10:54.971 --> 10:57.515
I have a ten-year-old. Tell me about it.

11:09.644 --> 11:10.720
Hondo, hold.

11:10.744 --> 11:12.300
Ma'am, I need you to go back inside now.

11:12.324 --> 11:14.335
- I got to go to work.
- No, you need to stay inside.

11:14.359 --> 11:15.470
Don't you tell me that.

11:15.494 --> 11:17.055
I need to drop off my kids
and catch a bus.

11:17.079 --> 11:18.890
- No, not now.
- I can't miss work!

11:18.914 --> 11:20.839
I'm only paid for my hours.
I need the money.

11:20.863 --> 11:23.083
Are you gonna feed my kids?
The door out is right there.

11:23.107 --> 11:25.230
- Deacon!
- Don't treat me like a criminal.

11:25.254 --> 11:26.731
- I have rights.
- Stevens.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.401
Go ahead. Move, hurry, hurry. Move.

11:30.425 --> 11:32.050
I am not thanking you.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.242
That mom was, uh,

11:37.266 --> 11:38.660
so loud and righteous.

11:38.684 --> 11:39.911
- Righteous?
- She thought so.

11:39.935 --> 11:41.579
The guy at the top
of the stairs heard her.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.698
You mean the handyman? Carlton?

11:43.722 --> 11:45.166
No, that was farther down the hall.

11:45.190 --> 11:46.701
First, there was a couple fighting.

11:46.725 --> 11:48.169
He'd figured she'd called 911.

11:48.193 --> 11:49.337
Domestic violence?

11:49.776 --> 11:51.061
Not by him anyway.

11:52.614 --> 11:54.042
You crazy thing!

11:54.066 --> 11:55.601
What the hell's the matter with you?

11:55.625 --> 11:57.712
You don't clear your phone
unless you got someone to hide!

11:57.736 --> 11:59.754
So you called the cops on me?!

11:59.778 --> 12:01.440
Why'd you call?! Why'd you call?!

12:01.464 --> 12:03.081
I didn't!

12:09.151 --> 12:11.067
Tell this idiot I didn't call!

12:11.091 --> 12:12.749
She didn't call, we are not here for you.

12:12.751 --> 12:15.363
Now, go back inside,
shut the door, shut your mouths.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.235
The guy was worried she'd get him busted

12:21.259 --> 12:23.121
for guns or stash or whatever.

12:23.145 --> 12:24.906
He thought it was revenge-by-cop.

12:24.930 --> 12:26.354
Another hero.

12:27.316 --> 12:28.910
- Tell me about the canine.
- Oh, yeah.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.295
The dog was freaking...

12:30.319 --> 12:31.435
all the noise and excitement.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.414
You know dogs can smell adrenaline.

12:33.438 --> 12:36.884
- He was in the apartment behind us.
- With the handyman?

12:36.908 --> 12:39.387
Playing like some kind of
a resident manager or something.

12:39.411 --> 12:41.768
Nothing about Carlton
said he'd be a problem.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.210
Even though you knew he had a jacket?

12:43.234 --> 12:45.310
Sure, but that was
a fed case got dropped.

12:45.334 --> 12:47.428
Guy was producing porn
without keeping track

12:47.452 --> 12:49.814
of all the screen aliases
the actors ever had.

12:49.838 --> 12:51.566
Carlton seemed to think
we were a robbery crew

12:51.590 --> 12:52.934
coming to hit him.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.819
Showed a whole lot of restraint.

12:54.843 --> 12:56.571
Well, that's how Hondo leads the team.

12:56.595 --> 12:57.945
Almost got you killed.

12:57.969 --> 13:00.775
I remember a tactical instructor
who said this is the only job

13:00.799 --> 13:02.110
where you can do everything right,

13:02.134 --> 13:03.516
and you can still get killed.

13:05.137 --> 13:07.043
Reason we pull hazard pay.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.283
There weren't supposed
to be any dogs on-site.

13:09.307 --> 13:10.618
The dog was new.

13:17.532 --> 13:19.427
Shots fired!

13:32.664 --> 13:35.331
Hey! I'm putting it down.

13:36.968 --> 13:37.979
Officer down!

13:38.003 --> 13:39.169
Hands up!

13:41.840 --> 13:43.868
Hands behind your back!
I didn't know you were cops!

13:43.892 --> 13:45.319
Where are you hit?

13:45.343 --> 13:47.155
It caught the vest. I'm good.

13:47.179 --> 13:48.645
Chris, stay here. Luca, move, move!

13:53.185 --> 13:55.163
You had an injured officer,

13:55.187 --> 13:56.714
you'd lost the element of surprise...

13:56.738 --> 13:58.966
I'm aware of the facts,
Sergeant. What's the question?

13:58.990 --> 14:00.968
Why didn't you reassess the plan?

14:00.992 --> 14:03.638
We are the point of the stick,
and the stick keeps going.

14:03.662 --> 14:06.641
That's how we train, over
and over: the stick keeps going.

14:06.665 --> 14:08.082
We followed protocol.

14:08.106 --> 14:09.677
Even with a third of your team sidelined?

14:09.701 --> 14:11.512
We were in a hot zone.

14:11.536 --> 14:13.398
We didn't have time to reassess.

14:13.422 --> 14:15.016
When you're up to your ass in alligators,

14:15.040 --> 14:17.568
it's too late to be thinking
about draining the swamp.

14:17.592 --> 14:18.820
You took a private call

14:18.844 --> 14:20.988
in the A.V. right before
the mission, correct?

14:21.012 --> 14:22.573
You already know that.

14:22.597 --> 14:24.992
We all have personal lives.
Emergencies happen.

14:25.016 --> 14:26.828
Mm-hmm.

14:26.852 --> 14:29.197
Is it possible the content of the call

14:29.221 --> 14:31.387
affected your tactical judgment?

14:33.525 --> 14:36.602
I'm asking if you were
distracted or upset

14:36.626 --> 14:38.278
before the mission began.

14:40.198 --> 14:44.429
I've been a cop a long time,
and I was a Marine before that.

14:45.076 --> 14:47.882
I can handle news,
but thank you for your concern.

14:47.906 --> 14:50.218
- Did you rush the entry?
- I did not.

14:50.242 --> 14:52.553
This was our chance to grab up
a dangerous fugitive

14:52.577 --> 14:54.188
who murdered an innocent family.

14:54.212 --> 14:56.390
Yeah, number one
on Metro's Most Wanted List.

14:56.414 --> 14:58.226
- And we were focused.
- And motivated.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.195
Bakir Hadad was still top of the charts.

15:01.219 --> 15:02.697
- It's not a contest.
- No,

15:02.721 --> 15:04.565
but it's a point of pride.

15:04.589 --> 15:06.033
Lot of pride.

15:06.057 --> 15:08.619
Ego and pride get you killed, Sergeant.

15:08.643 --> 15:11.038
We're trained to leave it at the door.

15:11.062 --> 15:13.875
We adjusted, and we brought him in.

15:14.772 --> 15:16.399
Let's go back to that call you took.

15:17.652 --> 15:20.236
Hey, the sooner we get through this,
the sooner you're out of here.

15:25.277 --> 15:27.805
Two little kids, mom, dad, grandma.

15:27.829 --> 15:29.613
And he's been Metro's
Most Wanted ever since.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.931
Swings through L.A. just long
enough to pick up his dope profits,

15:31.956 --> 15:32.977
and then he bounces.

15:33.001 --> 15:35.396
- And we finally got lucky.
- Yeah, because he got sloppy.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.765
- And he doesn't think we can touch him.
- Well, pride goeth

15:37.789 --> 15:39.400
before destruction and haughty spirit

15:39.424 --> 15:40.768
- before a fall.
- Hey.

15:40.792 --> 15:41.769
What's going on? I'm working.

15:41.793 --> 15:43.237
Something happened to Darryl.

15:43.261 --> 15:44.605
Hondo,

15:44.629 --> 15:48.276
the boy was shot while making
deliveries on his job.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.328
Okay, welcome zone straight ahead.

15:50.352 --> 15:52.613
I'm in the ER at Cienega South.

15:53.102 --> 15:55.583
They took Darryl into surgery already.

15:55.607 --> 15:57.952
But nobody is talking with me,

15:57.976 --> 16:01.622
nobody is making eye contact with me.

16:01.646 --> 16:05.343
Which you know means this is bad.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.649
That job was supposed to be safe.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.963
Mama, I can't do this right now.

16:08.987 --> 16:10.244
I know.

16:13.825 --> 16:15.155
Just get here as soon as you can, baby.

16:15.180 --> 16:16.274
Hondo.

16:18.663 --> 16:20.474
All right, let's make 'em hot.

16:20.498 --> 16:22.944
I love you, too. Look,
he's breathing and he's strong.

16:22.968 --> 16:24.612
- Perimeter fully contained?
- 100%, Sergeant.

16:24.636 --> 16:26.360
- I got to go.
- ...got eyes on the address.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.698
Nobody in, nobody out.

16:27.722 --> 16:29.113
You didn't evacuate the entire building?

16:29.138 --> 16:30.980
We were trying to preserve the
element of surprise.

16:31.004 --> 16:32.545
No reason to spook the target
if we didn't have to,

16:32.569 --> 16:33.821
given his history of slipping the grip.

16:33.845 --> 16:34.822
Then let's move.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.813
Fruit, ma'am?

16:58.203 --> 17:00.565
Since when is life fair?

17:01.712 --> 17:03.714
You know, I think I'm gonna
listen to my captain,

17:04.839 --> 17:07.134
and I'm-a wait for
a League lawyer to be here.

17:10.512 --> 17:13.031
Mind, uh, stating your name
for the record, Ed?

17:13.056 --> 17:14.367
Edward Yannick, acting legal counsel

17:14.391 --> 17:17.103
for Sergeant Daniel Harrelson, Jr.

17:17.712 --> 17:20.174
on behalf of the Los Angeles
Police Defense League.

17:20.198 --> 17:22.626
Glad you could join us
so we can put this to bed.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.295
Oh, is that what you're trying to do?

17:24.319 --> 17:26.180
Guys, we're all seeking the truth.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.598
I just got to find the weak spots

17:27.622 --> 17:29.466
before the lawsuits start up.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.102
- Let's keep going.
- Okay. Um,

17:32.126 --> 17:33.937
did the call from your mother

17:33.961 --> 17:35.995
impact your state of mind, Sergeant?

17:40.218 --> 17:43.176
Yes, but not the mission.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.282
Well, that's a subjective
judgment. How can you be sure?

17:45.306 --> 17:47.318
The sergeant already answered
your question, Nick.

17:47.342 --> 17:48.474
Next.

17:50.271 --> 17:51.622
We had a plan,

17:51.646 --> 17:53.306
we followed the plan.

17:53.848 --> 17:55.492
Since when does a SWAT plan

17:55.516 --> 17:58.102
leave an innocent bystander dead?

17:59.187 --> 18:01.522
You guys don't make mistakes like that.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.234
No, we don't. And we didn't.

18:06.027 --> 18:07.576
You can dig all you like.

18:08.863 --> 18:10.830
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

18:12.533 --> 18:15.179
You know, my gramps
was first generation SWAT,

18:15.203 --> 18:17.898
and my dad second. I'm third.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.582
I know what you're protecting.

18:20.758 --> 18:23.687
It ain't SWAT or the department.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.523
Every cop investigation is set up

18:26.547 --> 18:30.027
to insulate the city, not the officers.

18:30.051 --> 18:31.328
At least be real with me.

18:31.352 --> 18:33.247
I just need to learn what happened.

18:33.271 --> 18:35.032
- Something else.
- Like what?

18:35.056 --> 18:36.417
I know what you're doing.

18:36.441 --> 18:39.225
- Okay.
- We are not on the same side...

18:40.794 --> 18:42.625
...no matter how you try to play it.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.857
Does that mean
you're refusing to cooperate?

18:45.535 --> 18:48.903
No. This is me cooperating.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.275
Start at the top of the stairs.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.028
On the third floor.

18:54.825 --> 18:58.021
Deacon and I were on the door.

19:03.084 --> 19:05.000
Police! Show me your hands!

19:06.554 --> 19:07.588
Hey!

19:09.223 --> 19:11.510
Down! Give me your hands!
Hands behind your back!

19:11.534 --> 19:12.736
Stay down.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.571
Luca and I took the accomplice
into custody.

19:14.595 --> 19:16.573
That kept us in the grow room.

19:16.597 --> 19:19.042
Oh, while Sergeant Harrelson
and Officer Street

19:19.066 --> 19:20.411
approached the bedroom door?

19:20.435 --> 19:22.129
We were right there for backup.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.580
The suspect was cornered.

19:23.604 --> 19:26.133
You thought he was cornered.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.919
Yes. That's correct.

19:28.943 --> 19:30.754
We went in the door,

19:30.778 --> 19:33.090
they went to the left,
we took our guy down.

19:33.114 --> 19:36.093
And then they threw in
the flashbang, that was it.

19:36.117 --> 19:38.451
We didn't do anything wrong, all right?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.599
Bathroom break.

19:42.623 --> 19:44.935
Seems like I'm the only one
that needs them.

19:44.959 --> 19:46.743
- Any red flags in there?
- Uh,

19:46.767 --> 19:49.502
these interviews are never
pleasant, but no surprises yet.

19:49.526 --> 19:50.941
Are those the floor plans
that Boyer wanted?

19:50.965 --> 19:53.277
They were out of date
when Narcotics gave them to us,

19:53.301 --> 19:55.327
- we just didn't know it.
- The basics are there.

19:55.351 --> 19:56.762
I'll be right back.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.785
- Those the blueprints?
- Yeah.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.955
Thanks. You watching the interrogation?

20:04.979 --> 20:07.791
- Some.
- So? What do you think?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.676
I think my team had bad intel going in.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.595
We didn't have the current layout,

20:11.619 --> 20:12.729
we didn't know about the grow business.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.131
But they kept going.

20:14.155 --> 20:17.634
We can't wait for conditions to
be perfect to complete missions.

20:17.658 --> 20:19.019
You're pushing my best officer

20:19.043 --> 20:20.418
to admit a mistake he didn't make.

20:20.442 --> 20:23.726
Ask yourself, was the entry
tactically justified?

20:23.750 --> 20:26.527
My sergeant thought it was,
and that's all I need.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.279
You care about him.
Maybe you're too close

20:29.303 --> 20:30.481
to see the true picture here.

20:30.505 --> 20:31.865
Hadad could have gotten away again.

20:31.889 --> 20:34.034
He could have taken hostages.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.802
Ah. All better.

20:37.636 --> 20:38.989
You ready?

20:39.013 --> 20:40.681
Oh, absolutely.

20:48.022 --> 20:50.167
You made it personal. Right, Sergeant?

20:50.191 --> 20:51.942
Your team wasn't gonna
lose Hadad this time.

20:51.966 --> 20:54.032
Look at the autopsy pics
of the family he killed

20:54.056 --> 20:56.282
- before you get all righteous on me.
- Why don't you

20:56.306 --> 20:58.342
- walk me through the entry...
- I caught the tail end

20:58.366 --> 21:00.344
of your conversation with Boyer.

21:00.368 --> 21:01.979
First time I've seen
you get so worked up.

21:02.003 --> 21:03.680
You took the bait.

21:03.704 --> 21:06.182
I know. I'm sorry.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.351
They were growing khat.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.759
Street name, "African salad."

21:08.783 --> 21:10.187
I've never even heard of that before.

21:10.211 --> 21:11.655
Of course you haven't.

21:11.679 --> 21:13.323
You chew the leaves to get a buzz.

21:13.347 --> 21:15.025
It's the biggest cash crop in Somalia.

21:15.049 --> 21:17.077
It's used all over East
Africa, the Mid-East

21:17.101 --> 21:18.685
- and Arabian Peninsula.
- That must've pissed you off,

21:18.709 --> 21:19.965
finding it growing here in L.A.

21:19.989 --> 21:21.789
- You're a combat vet, right?
- Relevance, Sergeant?

21:21.813 --> 21:24.056
State of mind. We can move on.

21:25.692 --> 21:28.354
Are you and Hondo involved
in a romantic relationship?

21:30.531 --> 21:33.170
- Take your time.
- No. We're not.

21:33.194 --> 21:34.711
Not now?

21:34.735 --> 21:37.173
- How about in the past?
- Why do you ask?

21:37.197 --> 21:38.906
Over 30 years of being a cop.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.734
Way you're looking at him, defending him.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.854
I'd defend any of my officers.

21:43.879 --> 21:47.931
Were you two ever involved
in a romantic relationship?

21:55.139 --> 21:57.067
Even if he tried to jump out the window,

21:57.091 --> 21:58.402
we had a team in position.

21:58.426 --> 22:01.905
There was just one door
between us and him.

22:01.929 --> 22:04.875
The suspect had locked
the bedroom door behind him.

22:04.899 --> 22:07.422
I kicked the door in.
Sergeant Harrelson was covering.

22:07.446 --> 22:09.555
Putting the sergeant
in the room first, right?

22:09.579 --> 22:11.582
As point man, yes. That's how we train.

22:11.606 --> 22:13.454
You keep trying to second-guess me.

22:13.478 --> 22:15.969
These are questions,
they're not accusations.

22:15.993 --> 22:17.096
Except that I'm a suspect.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.280
No, you're a subject,
you and your sergeant.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.924
There were no tactical mistakes.

22:22.948 --> 22:24.509
There's still a dead civilian.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.378
Kayla Gleason would be

22:26.402 --> 22:30.382
supervising nap time
at her preschool right now.

22:30.406 --> 22:32.372
She just turned 23.

22:35.294 --> 22:36.853
I can't figure how it happened.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.225
You followed a direct order
from a commanding officer.

22:40.249 --> 22:41.893
You didn't have a choice.

22:41.917 --> 22:44.229
So now you're trying to play
divide and conquer, is that it?

22:44.253 --> 22:45.897
That's-that's bad math.

22:45.921 --> 22:47.899
Only if you told me
the whole truth about the guy

22:47.923 --> 22:49.639
who brought you back on the team
after cutting you.

22:51.084 --> 22:52.451
Someone who washes out of SWAT

22:52.475 --> 22:54.311
doesn't usually get a second chance.

22:54.335 --> 22:56.007
There were some trust issues.

22:56.031 --> 22:58.793
I had some things I needed
to learn. I didn't "wash out."

22:58.817 --> 23:02.580
Loyalty goes a long way, for all of us.

23:02.604 --> 23:06.384
You might be tempted to return the favor.

23:06.408 --> 23:08.954
Try to cover for your boss's mistake.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.612
You have no idea
how ridiculous you sound.

23:14.750 --> 23:15.866
So wise me up.

23:20.842 --> 23:23.343
20-David to Command. Suspect's
through to the next apartment.

23:28.130 --> 23:30.282
He's at the front door. Flashbang, now.

23:30.306 --> 23:32.160
We couldn't let him
get out the front door.

23:32.184 --> 23:34.656
That would've exposed
more civilians, more officers.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.551
Well, what about the girl
in the apartment?

23:36.575 --> 23:38.783
The bedroom was empty, before dawn.

23:38.807 --> 23:40.118
We didn't know she was there,

23:40.142 --> 23:41.453
we didn't know she was home,

23:41.477 --> 23:42.954
we didn't see her, we didn't hear her.

23:42.978 --> 23:44.589
It was noisy, though, right?

23:44.613 --> 23:47.297
With the takedown, the arrest,

23:47.321 --> 23:51.038
the tenants shouting,
the babies, the dog,

23:51.653 --> 23:53.631
the officers, the gunshots.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.573
We did a visual inspection.

24:03.332 --> 24:05.010
We should've seen her.

24:12.558 --> 24:14.486
Stay down! Stay down!

24:14.510 --> 24:17.489
You're done! This is 20-David
to all D-team units.

24:17.513 --> 24:19.650
Code 4, suspect in custody.

24:20.182 --> 24:21.527
Hondo.

24:23.153 --> 24:24.879
Nothing.

24:24.903 --> 24:27.215
Get over here, Street.
Cover me. Call it in now.

24:27.783 --> 24:31.135
26-David to Command.
We have female victim,

24:31.159 --> 24:32.807
down with head injury,

24:32.831 --> 24:36.256
non-responsive, no breathing,
no pulse. CPR initiated.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.309
You killed her. You killed her.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.166
Shut up!

24:44.039 --> 24:45.884
Did we do this?

24:49.928 --> 24:53.517
Come on. Come on. Come on.

24:57.638 --> 24:59.949
Momma, tell me what's happening.

24:59.973 --> 25:01.985
Darryl's still in surgery.

25:02.009 --> 25:03.703
How much longer?

25:03.727 --> 25:05.455
They couldn't estimate.

25:05.479 --> 25:06.790
You find out how many times he got hit?

25:06.814 --> 25:07.991
Twice.

25:08.015 --> 25:11.327
Once in his side and once in his leg.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.371
Driver didn't even get hurt.

25:15.189 --> 25:17.000
Is the shooter in custody?

25:17.024 --> 25:20.837
I don't think so.
Well, let's just be grateful

25:20.861 --> 25:23.759
that at least the doctors
stopped the bleeding, all right?

25:23.783 --> 25:25.421
I'm gonna get there as soon
as I can, all right?

25:25.445 --> 25:28.178
They're saying nobody can visit
until he's stable in recovery.

25:29.011 --> 25:31.638
At least a couple of hours, if...

25:32.539 --> 25:35.069
if Darryl beats the odds against him.

25:35.093 --> 25:36.853
Ma. Ma, I'm gonna get there.

25:36.877 --> 25:38.354
I tried to call his mother.

25:38.378 --> 25:42.692
Biology does not make her
any kind of mom.

25:43.150 --> 25:46.101
No way to reach her.
No voice mail on her phone.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.867
We could lose him.

25:53.827 --> 25:57.674
He did everything right, everything,

25:57.698 --> 25:59.375
and look what happened.

25:59.399 --> 26:01.094
No, Ma. Ma, don't do that.

26:01.118 --> 26:02.961
Don't you give up hope on him too soon.

26:03.737 --> 26:04.963
You hear me?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.218
Momma?

26:08.674 --> 26:10.019
I hear you.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.410
I hear you, son.

26:21.138 --> 26:24.339
Oh, God, help us.

26:26.426 --> 26:28.955
- Is this a progress report?
- Uh, yes, it is.

26:28.979 --> 26:31.040
Let you know that we finished
most of the interviews.

26:31.064 --> 26:32.575
Uh, we're still talking
to the subject officers,

26:32.599 --> 26:34.043
but the rest of your team's released.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.211
Why not everybody?

26:36.119 --> 26:37.964
Harrelson and Street are good cops.

26:37.988 --> 26:40.884
They got the job done, but
lawyers are gonna see liability

26:40.908 --> 26:42.252
based on reckless endangerment.

26:42.276 --> 26:43.720
They're not reckless officers.

26:43.744 --> 26:45.138
They threw in a flashbang

26:45.162 --> 26:46.639
and a woman died from a head injury

26:46.663 --> 26:48.391
as a result of their action.

26:48.415 --> 26:50.442
And you've already decided that
without waiting for all the facts?

26:50.466 --> 26:53.096
I've heard no evidence that suggests
any other possible explanations.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.898
So unless you can raise the dead,

26:55.222 --> 26:56.432
doesn't look good.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.058
I'm sorry.

26:59.126 --> 27:03.406
And I'm sorry if I offended you
earlier, Captain.

27:03.430 --> 27:04.774
Peace?

27:05.315 --> 27:06.692
Sure.

27:15.309 --> 27:17.741
- Ready to continue?
- I mean to be at that hospital

27:17.765 --> 27:19.091
when that boy gets out of surgery,

27:19.115 --> 27:20.256
whether we're done here or not.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.791
You hear how that sounds, don't you?

27:21.815 --> 27:23.593
Like personal comes first to you.

27:23.617 --> 27:24.711
Like you might've hurried

27:24.735 --> 27:26.462
the mission in order
to check in on this kid.

27:26.486 --> 27:28.631
- What's the question, Nick?
- I didn't hurry anything!

27:29.590 --> 27:31.467
I'm just trying to hurry you.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.469
Can we all just try to get back on track?

27:33.493 --> 27:36.472
Okay. Would you have ordered the
stun grenade deployed if you'd

27:36.496 --> 27:37.873
known the victim was in the room?

27:37.897 --> 27:40.810
I'd have used the same tactic, yes.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.478
The suspect could've
grabbed her as a hostage.

27:42.502 --> 27:44.147
He could've killed her.

27:44.171 --> 27:46.816
We knew that our best choice
was maximum shock

27:46.840 --> 27:48.201
with minimum damage,

27:48.225 --> 27:50.486
and a flashbang is a non-lethal weapon.

27:50.510 --> 27:52.067
Usually. Not this time.

27:52.091 --> 27:54.958
You're assuming that we had
an option without risk.

27:54.982 --> 27:56.793
I chose the option with the least risk.

27:56.817 --> 27:58.661
That doesn't mean zero risk.

27:58.685 --> 28:01.331
If any one of eight things
had played out another way,

28:01.355 --> 28:03.333
we wouldn't even be here.

28:03.357 --> 28:04.551
But here we are.

28:05.208 --> 28:08.670
Ask me a question or let me leave.

28:13.834 --> 28:15.678
If I hadn't mentioned that phone call...

28:15.702 --> 28:17.096
Deac, they already had the record.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.682
They know the answers before
they ever ask the questions.

28:19.706 --> 28:22.402
Even if they clear Hondo and Street,

28:22.426 --> 28:25.043
a civilian still died during our
raid, and we got to own that.

28:28.649 --> 28:30.526
What if they don't clear
Hondo and Street?

28:31.151 --> 28:32.912
Look, we're trained to make

28:32.936 --> 28:35.331
the best choices. Me, I'm
gonna trust the training.

28:35.355 --> 28:37.033
We had no alternatives.

28:37.057 --> 28:38.585
You know they'll jump all over
every inconsistency

28:38.609 --> 28:40.503
or contradiction in the interviews.

28:40.527 --> 28:41.723
Dude, maybe you need to go home

28:41.748 --> 28:42.839
- and take a rest...
- I'm fine.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.007
- ...instead of criticizing.
- Hey, hey.

28:44.031 --> 28:45.758
Dial it down.

28:46.583 --> 28:47.710
We're a team.

28:47.734 --> 28:49.212
Exactly.

28:49.836 --> 28:51.254
That's what I meant.

28:52.547 --> 28:54.564
We should go the building
and figure it out ourselves.

28:54.588 --> 28:56.185
All right, time to get proactive.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.222
- You good with that?
- Yeah.

28:59.721 --> 29:01.579
I'm gonna grab Chris.
I'll meet you there.

29:12.092 --> 29:13.536
Anything?

29:13.560 --> 29:15.797
- Nothing?
- Man, I hate canvassing.

29:15.821 --> 29:16.873
Okay, so,

29:16.897 --> 29:18.374
- what have we missed?
- I don't know.

29:18.398 --> 29:20.126
You tell me, Chris,
'cause I'm out of ideas.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.244
So let's walk it again.

29:21.268 --> 29:22.412
Okay. All right, hey,

29:22.436 --> 29:23.463
I'll meet you in there.

29:24.093 --> 29:25.137
Officer.

29:28.942 --> 29:31.638
Hey. Thank you.

29:31.662 --> 29:33.139
Thought you weren't gonna say that.

29:33.163 --> 29:36.559
I had no idea
what was happening upstairs.

29:36.583 --> 29:37.977
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

29:38.001 --> 29:39.646
Did you get to work on time?

29:39.670 --> 29:41.764
Yes, I did. I appreciate your help,

29:41.788 --> 29:43.599
so if you need some kind of witness,

29:43.623 --> 29:47.103
I'm happy to testify about
our so-called handyman, Carlton.

29:47.127 --> 29:48.571
- What? The guy with the dog?
- Yeah.

29:48.595 --> 29:51.274
That guy definitely knew
all about that dope farm,

29:51.298 --> 29:53.109
the way that he sneaks
into people's apartments,

29:53.133 --> 29:55.995
especially women's.
I caught him in mine once.

29:56.019 --> 29:57.447
- Inside your apartment?
- Yeah.

29:57.471 --> 29:58.915
He said he was changing the batteries

29:58.939 --> 30:00.166
on everybody's smoke detectors,

30:00.190 --> 30:02.952
but I think he was just
in my underwear drawer.

30:02.976 --> 30:04.620
I mean, the damn detector
never works anyway,

30:04.644 --> 30:07.957
not even when you set a fire in
the kitchen, and I did, twice.

30:07.981 --> 30:09.792
Well, that's got to be scary,
especially with kids.

30:09.816 --> 30:11.461
Yeah, well, without kids,

30:11.485 --> 30:13.346
I would've been paying
attention to the stove.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.014
Maybe I should check
those batteries for you.

30:15.038 --> 30:16.871
Sure. Yeah, come on.

30:23.130 --> 30:25.942
Me and the kids are gonna go
stay at my sister's

30:25.966 --> 30:27.643
until things get normal around here.

30:28.351 --> 30:29.862
Hello?

30:29.886 --> 30:31.647
Hey, Deac, what're you doing?

30:31.671 --> 30:33.482
Hey, come here, take this.

30:45.152 --> 30:47.380
It's a camera.

30:47.404 --> 30:48.498
Oh, man.

30:48.522 --> 30:50.786
- Peeping Tom with tech skills.
- What?

30:50.810 --> 30:52.583
Might explain why that
flashbang didn't trip an alarm

30:52.607 --> 30:53.835
in the girl's apartment.

31:39.873 --> 31:41.539
Chris?

31:52.219 --> 31:54.697
Now, if there's a cam inside,

31:54.721 --> 31:56.199
we don't know what it's gonna show.

31:56.606 --> 31:58.534
Maybe nothing,

31:58.558 --> 32:00.953
and maybe it incriminates
Street and Hondo.

32:01.570 --> 32:02.677
It's proof.

32:04.483 --> 32:06.178
Either way. Good or bad.

32:06.255 --> 32:08.038
We don't have to find out.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.747
It just looks like
a smoke detector to me.

32:15.158 --> 32:17.420
Once we do this, we can't go back.

32:17.444 --> 32:20.590
If we made a mistake, we need to know.

32:21.214 --> 32:22.642
If we didn't,

32:23.091 --> 32:25.094
they need to know.

32:25.118 --> 32:26.835
But we can't be afraid of the truth.

32:28.255 --> 32:29.754
That's not who we are.

32:40.106 --> 32:41.689
We should document the search.

32:44.604 --> 32:46.616
- Ready?
- Go.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.117
I'm Sergeant David Kay,

32:48.141 --> 32:49.452
this is Apartment 339,

32:49.476 --> 32:51.787
4691 Anacapa Avenue.

32:51.811 --> 32:54.457
Based on information provided to me

32:54.481 --> 32:56.125
by another tenant in this building,

32:56.149 --> 32:59.033
I have learned that the smoke
detectors in these apartments

32:59.057 --> 33:01.514
may contain hidden surveillance cameras.

33:02.005 --> 33:04.072
This recording will document that search.

33:14.968 --> 33:16.668
Got it.

33:28.348 --> 33:30.181
It's another camera.

33:32.217 --> 33:33.633
Too late now.

33:39.061 --> 33:41.590
I've asked Tech Support
to cue up the relevant footage

33:41.621 --> 33:43.257
from the SD card
pulled out of the camera.

33:43.281 --> 33:44.926
- Commander, you didn't...
- No, Sergeant.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.544
I have not seen it yet.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.546
We're gonna share
the experience together.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.036
If you could hold off
on your interruptions.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.051
Are we ready?

33:53.075 --> 33:54.391
Play it.

34:00.082 --> 34:01.526
20-David to Command!

34:01.550 --> 34:03.233
Suspect's through
into the next apartment.

34:15.397 --> 34:17.208
Stay down!

34:17.232 --> 34:19.108
Stay down! You're done!

34:19.132 --> 34:21.579
This is 20-David to all D-team units.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.130
Code 4, suspect in custody.

34:24.212 --> 34:25.964
We did not do that.

34:26.574 --> 34:28.753
- For once, I'm glad there was a camera.
- Are the subject

34:28.777 --> 34:30.588
officers released from further
questioning, Sergeant?

34:30.612 --> 34:32.090
Yes, ma'am.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.808
We're as relieved as you are, Commander.

34:33.831 --> 34:35.532
Thank you.

34:41.422 --> 34:44.819
I hope the rest of the news

34:44.842 --> 34:46.571
gets better for you.

34:46.594 --> 34:48.069
I appreciate that.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.336
I called the DA's office.

35:02.751 --> 35:05.089
Hadad's exposed for another
first-degree murder charge.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.626
"Homicide during a felony with
reckless indifference."

35:08.650 --> 35:11.145
- How many life sentences can he serve?
- Not enough,

35:11.169 --> 35:13.681
but at least he won't
be making more bodies.

35:13.705 --> 35:16.185
Oh, man, I don't even
know what to do for that.

35:16.209 --> 35:17.802
Annie swears by arnica gel.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.353
Yeah, so does my mom.

35:19.377 --> 35:21.139
Okay, we've been waiting
years for this moment.

35:21.163 --> 35:24.358
It's time to take down
Bakir Hadad's beauty shot.

35:24.382 --> 35:25.977
Where's Hondo?

35:26.001 --> 35:28.178
Uh, I think something's
going on with Darryl.

35:28.202 --> 35:31.570
- Who?
- Uh, he's this kid from juvie

35:31.594 --> 35:33.456
Hondo and his mom have been
kind of looking after.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.652
Wait, Darryl?

35:34.676 --> 35:35.987
Leroy Henderson's kid?

35:36.011 --> 35:37.455
Yeah. Hondo didn't want to make
a big deal about it.

35:37.479 --> 35:39.457
- How'd you find out?
- He asked me

35:39.481 --> 35:41.793
about the foster system,
'cause, you know,

35:41.817 --> 35:43.961
I went through it. But uh,

35:43.985 --> 35:45.296
I think maybe he's trying to give Darryl

35:45.320 --> 35:46.714
- something better.
- I hope he's okay.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.421
Me, too.

35:49.524 --> 35:51.491
Everyone deserves a second chance.

35:54.636 --> 35:56.507
You're highest ranking in the room, Deac.

35:56.963 --> 35:58.407
Do the honors, man.

35:58.432 --> 35:59.932
All right.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.659
Did you think they'd been reckless?

36:19.054 --> 36:20.865
We weren't there.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.867
I had to consider the possibility,

36:22.891 --> 36:25.086
and the appearance of possibility.

36:25.708 --> 36:27.872
Both of which would've
kept me awake at night.

36:27.896 --> 36:29.450
Sir, I know you're disappointed in me...

36:29.474 --> 36:30.541
We're not talking about it.

36:30.565 --> 36:31.876
- I need to explain...
- For your own good,

36:31.900 --> 36:33.761
We shouldn't talk about it.

36:33.785 --> 36:35.096
When that relationship began,

36:35.120 --> 36:37.048
it wasn't in violation of policy.

36:37.072 --> 36:39.183
As soon as you moved Hondo to 20-David,

36:39.207 --> 36:40.551
we knew what we had to do.

36:40.575 --> 36:42.386
Took a little while, but we ended it.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.772
It hasn't affected his job
performance or mine.

36:44.796 --> 36:46.496
How would you know?

36:50.418 --> 36:52.897
Yeah. It's a double standard.

36:52.921 --> 36:55.566
But personal relationships
like that don't help women

36:55.590 --> 36:57.407
rise in a male hierarchy.

36:58.426 --> 36:59.904
They just compromise you.

37:01.202 --> 37:02.620
I know.

37:03.431 --> 37:04.792
I'm sorry.

37:05.206 --> 37:06.577
Me, too.

37:06.601 --> 37:08.246
But since we never had this conversation,

37:08.270 --> 37:10.486
I have no knowledge I might need
to do something about.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.753
Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.755
Good night, sir. Thank you.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.138
Oh, please.

37:33.067 --> 37:34.218
Hey.

37:34.796 --> 37:35.884
Hey.

37:40.059 --> 37:42.535
- Are we gonna talk about...
- Nothing to say.

37:50.478 --> 37:52.006
You hardly even look at me anymore.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.281
Okay.

37:57.342 --> 37:58.629
That kiss?

37:59.636 --> 38:01.424
I thought that was...

38:01.448 --> 38:03.634
a mutual moment that we had.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.241
Was I wrong?

38:05.266 --> 38:06.804
I-I didn't mean to cross any lines.

38:06.828 --> 38:08.472
Except we did.

38:08.978 --> 38:10.480
Me, more than you.

38:12.148 --> 38:13.716
And I've felt guilty ever since.

38:15.971 --> 38:18.480
- I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen again.
- I know.

38:18.504 --> 38:19.984
- I promise you.
- I know it's not gonna happen

38:20.008 --> 38:23.487
again, because...
I moved in with Ty and Kira.

38:24.786 --> 38:26.407
- Because of me?
- No.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.659
Because of me.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.629
It made me realize that...

38:31.918 --> 38:33.631
I really needed to commit to them.

38:34.087 --> 38:35.466
A hundred percent.

38:36.631 --> 38:37.718
You and me, we're...

38:38.132 --> 38:39.881
teammates. That's all.

38:41.469 --> 38:44.342
We're more than just teammates.
We're friends.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.474
We can't be like that anymore, Street.

38:47.568 --> 38:49.067
It wouldn't be fair to them.

38:54.502 --> 38:56.169
I don't have a lot of friends.

38:58.213 --> 39:01.859
I trust you. With my life.

39:02.532 --> 39:05.029
And I'm always gonna have
your back on the job.

39:05.785 --> 39:07.829
But that's where it ends from now on.

39:14.504 --> 39:16.121
I have to go.

39:17.835 --> 39:19.757
They're waiting for me.

39:24.039 --> 39:25.471
They're not right for you.

39:29.851 --> 39:31.019
I just...

39:31.388 --> 39:33.187
I don't want you
to get your heart broken.

39:35.483 --> 39:37.400
Not your problem, Street.

39:41.218 --> 39:42.864
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.513
Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.767
Yes? I'm looking for Henderson.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.402
Darryl. Gunshot trauma.

40:18.426 --> 40:20.321
This way.

41:30.939 --> 41:32.643
No...
