00:02.635 --> 00:04.202
<i>(whistles)</i>

00:04.203 --> 00:06.638
Now, that is
a filthy spark plug.

00:06.639 --> 00:09.841
Yes, it is.
And there are many ways
to clean a dirty plug.

00:09.842 --> 00:12.611
You can use a file,
a wire brush...

00:12.612 --> 00:15.213
Steel wool or al's beard.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.451
But if you want to get it
really clean,

00:20.452 --> 00:23.722
We suggest using binford's
6100 spark plug cleaner.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.724
Very easy to use.
Turn away, please, al.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.726
Just shove sparky
right in there.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.928
<i>(high voice)</i>
"no, no, no, no."

00:29.929 --> 00:32.063
Turn it on.
<i>(machine whirs)</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:34.065
Blow it off.

00:34.066 --> 00:36.234
Now, that is a spark plug
that's clean.

00:36.235 --> 00:38.236
Clean enough to eat off of.

00:38.237 --> 00:40.238
Be a small meal, though,
wouldn't it?

00:40.239 --> 00:42.573
Little piece of turkey.
Pass the gravy, al.

00:42.574 --> 00:44.575
Once you've removed
the buildup,

00:44.576 --> 00:46.978
It's always a good idea
to recheck the gap.

00:46.979 --> 00:50.414
Right. Ok. Perfect. .035.

00:50.415 --> 00:53.417
You need a proper gap
to get the proper spark.

00:53.418 --> 00:55.086
How would you know?

00:55.087 --> 00:57.522
It's been years
since you've given off
a proper spark.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.825
As opposed to your sparks,

01:00.826 --> 01:04.896
Which have caused millions
of dollars in fire damage.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.831
<i>(hisses)</i>

01:08.734 --> 01:11.536
Now, a misfiring spark plug
is easy to diagnose.

01:11.537 --> 01:14.438
Bigger problems
sometimes require
taking the whole engine apart.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.775
That can be a dirty,
time-consuming job -

01:16.776 --> 01:18.777
Though a heck
of a lot of fun.

01:18.778 --> 01:22.047
A heck and a half, especially
if you do it buck naked.

01:23.649 --> 01:26.484
But there's another way
to check what's going on
in your engine -

01:26.485 --> 01:28.586
Just crawl inside
and take a look.

01:28.587 --> 01:30.254
Unbelievable as that may sound,

01:30.255 --> 01:33.692
Tomorrow, tim and I
are actually gonna shrink down
and go inside this engine.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.694
And how are we gonna
do that, tim?

01:35.695 --> 01:38.063
Luckily, our favorite place
to buy shrink rays

01:38.064 --> 01:40.331
Had them on sale -
shrink rays r us.

01:40.332 --> 01:43.968
It's a small place
with a small staff,
little cash registers...

01:43.969 --> 01:46.705
Tim.
...Little, tiny people,
little wallets you pull out...

01:46.706 --> 01:49.407
Tim.
We will now give you
a demonstration

01:49.408 --> 01:51.409
Of how the shrink ray works.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.344
Care to be belittled?

01:55.280 --> 01:57.982
That's my job, tim.

02:03.155 --> 02:05.690
<i>(grunts)</i>

02:07.927 --> 02:09.693
Come on. Come on.

02:09.695 --> 02:12.030
Hey!

02:12.031 --> 02:15.533
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
<i>(whistles)</i>

02:15.534 --> 02:19.637
Well, it's a small world
after all.
Ugh, please.

03:16.428 --> 03:20.098
My, my, my.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.167
We've got the leg on.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.502
What do you think
of dad's birthday present?

03:24.503 --> 03:27.505
That is very impressive -
a man made out of tools.

03:27.506 --> 03:29.507
I think
you boys have inherited

03:29.508 --> 03:32.576
Your father's
mechanical abilities.
Yeah.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.445
Yes, indeedy.

03:36.982 --> 03:40.151
Hey, tin man tim's
really starting
to look like dad.

03:40.152 --> 03:44.488
Yep. He's even got
a stomach full of beer
and corn nuts.

03:46.025 --> 03:49.260
Look what we used
for the nose -
needle-nose pliers.

03:49.261 --> 03:52.663
Cool. What is
that steel wool
supposed to be?

03:52.664 --> 03:55.967
Oh, that's his chest hair.

03:57.336 --> 04:01.339
Save some for his back.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.174
Hey, what are you guys
doing out here?

04:03.175 --> 04:05.109
<i>(boys)</i> nothing.

04:05.110 --> 04:08.847
Making a birthday gift
for your handsome,
talented, studly father?

04:08.848 --> 04:11.249
No, they're making one
for you.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.184
Get in here.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.186
I got the whole birthday
mapped out.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.755
6:00, you guys shower me
with gifts. Yeah.

04:17.755 --> 04:21.259
Then you fix me the thickest
juiciest steak you can find,

04:21.260 --> 04:23.761
Baked potato,
lots of butter, sour cream,

04:23.762 --> 04:26.331
Season it with a little salt -
13 cups.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.702
Then when the little
velociraptors go to bed,

04:31.703 --> 04:34.305
You and I retreat
to our private love nest.

04:34.306 --> 04:37.976
Oh, no.
Not the garage again.

04:39.578 --> 04:45.283
I made it better this year.
I shellacked the workbench.

04:45.284 --> 04:49.687
You shellacked
the workbench last year,
and it didn't dry in time.

04:51.957 --> 04:54.025
That's why you weren't moving.

04:58.197 --> 05:00.098
Tim, you are almost 40.

05:00.099 --> 05:02.767
Isn't it time for you
to celebrate a birthday
in a bed?

05:02.768 --> 05:05.270
I may be reaching
the big 4-0,

05:05.271 --> 05:08.739
But I have
the strength and endurance
of a man half my age.

05:08.740 --> 05:11.742
Does this feel like the body
of a 20-year-old or what?

05:11.743 --> 05:13.244
Stop. Don't.

05:13.245 --> 05:15.380
Yeah, a 20-year-old
who's deluded.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.316
You're just jealous 'cause men
age better than women.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.951
Oh, really?

05:19.952 --> 05:22.453
Then how come ever since
I went back to school,

05:22.454 --> 05:25.924
All these young college guys
have been... Hanging around me?

05:25.925 --> 05:27.425
I don't know.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.094
Maybe they're away from home
for the first time

05:30.095 --> 05:32.096
And they miss their mommies.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.437
Does everybody know
what time it is?

05:39.438 --> 05:40.972
<i>Tool time!</i>

05:40.973 --> 05:43.474
That's right. And today,
those minimechanics
from binford

05:43.475 --> 05:45.643
Will actually go
inside a troubled engine.

05:45.644 --> 05:47.645
Are you guys in there?

05:50.682 --> 05:52.683
<i>(tim)</i> is this engine
knocking, al?

05:52.684 --> 05:54.685
<i>(al)</i> no, I think
that's heidi.

05:54.686 --> 05:58.122
<i>(heidi knocks)</i>
hi, heidi.

05:58.123 --> 06:01.625
Welcome, everybody,
to the inside of a chevy
small-block 350.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.628
Al and I are standing inside
of a carter afb carburetor.

06:04.629 --> 06:07.298
I love what you've done
with the place.

06:07.299 --> 06:10.568
Really? I thought
the throttle butterflies
were a bit busy.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.570
Oh, no. Not at all.

06:12.571 --> 06:14.572
Now, the problem
with this engine

06:14.573 --> 06:17.575
Is that it has low compression
in the number three cylinder.

06:17.576 --> 06:19.810
So that's
where we'll be headed.
That's right.

06:19.811 --> 06:22.313
Now, traveling
through an engine
is dangerous,

06:22.314 --> 06:24.315
So don't try this at home

06:24.316 --> 06:27.551
Unless you, too,
are 4 inches tall.
Right.

06:27.552 --> 06:30.421
All right, al.
Are you ready?

06:30.422 --> 06:32.823
I'm ready.
<i>(engine revs)</i>

06:32.824 --> 06:34.225
<i>(both)</i> whee!

06:34.226 --> 06:37.328
Whoa... Aah!

06:37.329 --> 06:40.465
Heidi, turn off the motor!

06:40.466 --> 06:45.269
Yeah, ha-ha-ha! Whoa!

06:45.270 --> 06:47.271
Whaah.

06:47.272 --> 06:50.041
All right. Well,
when compression
is the problem,

06:50.042 --> 06:53.211
What you wanna look for
is a worn piston
or cylinder wall.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.314
A good indication of that
would be piston slap.

06:56.315 --> 07:00.818
You don't wanna slap
any detroit pistons,
because they slap back.

07:00.819 --> 07:03.754
Well, the piston
and cylinder wall look fine.

07:03.755 --> 07:07.492
The next thing
you wanna look at
is burnt exhaust valve.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.027
There's your problem, mister.

07:09.028 --> 07:12.030
That exhaust valve is burnt
to a crisp.
Yes, it is.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.433
Well, now that we've found
the problem, what we need to do

07:15.434 --> 07:18.436
Is replace that burnt valve
and rebuild the cylinder heads,

07:18.437 --> 07:20.604
And that could be
an awfully big job.

07:20.605 --> 07:22.873
It takes a big man
to admit he's too small

07:22.874 --> 07:25.109
For a big job
on a small-block engine.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.645
Well, I couldn't have said it
better myself.

07:27.646 --> 07:31.149
I'm not sure
you could have said it, al.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.084
All right, heidi.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.086
Start the motor

07:35.087 --> 07:37.988
And bring us home.

07:37.989 --> 07:41.426
<i>(both)</i> whoa!

07:44.430 --> 07:47.798
Ok, heidi,
make us big again.

07:47.799 --> 07:50.068
<i>(whistles)</i>

07:50.069 --> 07:54.905
Well, it's good to be
full-sized tool men
once again. Right, al?

07:54.906 --> 07:57.908
<i>(al)</i> tim! Tim!
Al?

07:57.909 --> 08:00.078
Tim. Tim, I'm down here!

08:00.079 --> 08:02.413
Al.
Whoa!

08:04.149 --> 08:07.151
Hey.
Help me!

08:07.152 --> 08:10.154
Guess that
reverse shrinking ray
doesn't work on everybody.

08:10.155 --> 08:12.156
So, on your way out tonight,

08:12.157 --> 08:15.059
If you step on something
flannel and squishy
and real little,

08:15.060 --> 08:16.561
It could be al.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.996
Tim, do something!

08:22.867 --> 08:25.369
Hey, felix.
Hey, timmy.
How are you doing?

08:25.370 --> 08:26.737
Hey, tim.
Harry.

08:26.738 --> 08:29.173
Hey, benny.
Good to see you.

08:29.174 --> 08:32.076
Did you ever get
that metal sliver
out of your eye?

08:32.077 --> 08:35.044
Yeah, I took your advice.
I used a magnet.
All right.

08:35.046 --> 08:38.448
How's business, boss?
Oh, it's great
now that you're here.

08:38.450 --> 08:42.153
I'm in a buying mood today.
All right.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.689
Pro hacksaw.
I need a saw blade.

08:45.690 --> 08:49.727
And - what the heck? -
A round of screwdrivers
for everybody.

08:49.728 --> 08:51.429
Hey! Thanks, timmy.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.931
Felix, how's your
plumbing business going?

08:53.932 --> 08:55.933
Oh, never a dull moment.

08:55.934 --> 08:57.935
You wouldn't believe
what I found

08:57.936 --> 09:00.070
In a stopped-up toilet.

09:00.071 --> 09:02.140
It was the size
of a house cat.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.841
Ugh.
Ugh.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.579
Actually,
it was a house cat.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.684
What else can I get for you,
tim? Some nuts, some bolts?

09:13.685 --> 09:17.054
No, thanks. I came in looking
for needle-nose pliers.
Mine are missing.

09:17.055 --> 09:20.558
That's funny.
This morning I couldn't
find my pipe wrench.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.226
If this keeps up,

09:22.227 --> 09:25.363
I'm organizing
a neighborhood tool watch.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.865
Drop-forged chrome steel,
cushioned grip.

09:27.866 --> 09:29.367
These any good, harry?

09:29.368 --> 09:31.536
Oh, yeah. And I got
a special on 'em -

09:31.537 --> 09:34.138
Buy a dozen, get one free.

09:37.942 --> 09:40.645
Who needs a dozen of these,
you know?

09:40.646 --> 09:43.314
But I can't pass up
a freebie like that.

09:44.849 --> 09:46.984
I love this guy.

09:46.985 --> 09:49.920
Hey, tim,
have some jerky.

09:49.921 --> 09:52.256
All right.

09:52.257 --> 09:55.426
"tubby john's jerky."
take a stick, guys. Felix?

09:55.427 --> 10:00.097
None for me, tim.
My doctor got me
on a low-fat diet.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.832
Just started, huh?

10:04.069 --> 10:05.769
<i>(laughs)</i>

10:05.770 --> 10:09.674
My father ate this stuff
every day of his life,
and he lived to be 90.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.677
All I know is that fatty stuff
will clog up your hoses.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.412
Oh, come on, felix.
Yeah.

10:14.413 --> 10:17.582
Aw, if you're a real man,
you can eat whatever you want.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.719
It's like they say -
fat builds muscle.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.887
Who says?

10:23.888 --> 10:27.758
Tubby john.
Right next to the warning
by the surgeon general.

10:29.194 --> 10:32.062
Benny's right.
I eat this stuff all the time,

10:32.063 --> 10:34.064
And I'm as fit
as when I was in the service.

10:34.065 --> 10:37.535
I heard the only service
you could get into
was the postal service.

10:37.536 --> 10:41.405
I heard you had a rough battle
with a poodle on your route.

10:41.406 --> 10:44.074
Ok. I happen to have been
in the marines -

10:44.075 --> 10:45.809
You guys know that -

10:45.810 --> 10:48.178
And we used to do push-ups
on our fists.

10:48.179 --> 10:51.415
Hey, check this out.
Count how many I can do
in a minute. Ready?

10:51.416 --> 10:56.954
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

10:56.955 --> 10:59.290
That all you can do?
Five?

10:59.291 --> 11:01.359
What are you
breathing so hard for?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.761
You act like you're
having a heart attack.

11:03.762 --> 11:06.096
I think I might be.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.098
<i>(felix)</i> take it easy.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.036
Hi, honey.

11:13.037 --> 11:15.172
Oh, look what I got
for you -

11:15.173 --> 11:17.742
The thickest slab o' beef
in all of detroit

11:17.743 --> 11:19.777
And your seasoning.

11:19.778 --> 11:21.945
I gotta cancel the steak,
cancel the seasoning,

11:21.946 --> 11:24.181
And, as much
as I don't wanna say it,

11:24.182 --> 11:27.718
Cancel our shellac party
in the garage.

11:27.719 --> 11:29.754
What are you talking about?

11:29.755 --> 11:32.089
Harry had a heart attack.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.392
Harry the hardware store guy?

11:34.393 --> 11:36.761
He's ok, though.
It was a minor heart attack.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.363
It was like a wake-up call
for me.

11:39.364 --> 11:41.799
I could've been the guy
laying on the floor

11:41.800 --> 11:44.302
Getting mouth-to-mouth
by a 250-pound plumber.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.836
You?
Yeah.

11:45.837 --> 11:48.639
Harry and I go way back.
He's an ex-marine
in great shape.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.974
I played high school football
with this guy.

11:50.975 --> 11:53.944
I thought you were
the team towel boy.

11:53.945 --> 11:56.447
I'm trying
to make a point here.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.684
I gotta start eating better.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.320
The doctor said 40-year-old men
should take better care
of themselves.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.154
He called me middle-aged.

12:04.155 --> 12:06.924
You are not middle-aged.
You're barely 40.

12:06.925 --> 12:09.794
And, as I recall,
this morning, you were 20.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.297
And look how time flies.

12:13.298 --> 12:17.501
I wake up 20, by noon I'm 40,
at dinner I'm dead.

12:17.502 --> 12:21.372
By tomorrow morning
I'll be remarried.

12:21.373 --> 12:25.309
Look, you're getting
a little carried away,
don't you think?

12:25.310 --> 12:28.312
No, I don't think.
I'm not a kid anymore.

12:28.313 --> 12:30.314
Tim, look at you.
You're in great shape.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.850
You have incredible energy,
sometimes way too much energy.

12:32.851 --> 12:34.952
You are not gonna have
a heart attack.

12:34.953 --> 12:37.421
Maybe not a heart attack,
but other things could kill me.

12:37.422 --> 12:39.790
Tell me, what is this
ugly lump on my neck?

12:39.791 --> 12:41.592
Your head.

12:48.032 --> 12:50.033
Can't anyone in this house
have a conversation

12:50.034 --> 12:52.069
Without somebody else
being sarcastic?

12:52.070 --> 12:54.304
Tim, it is a pimple.

12:54.305 --> 12:56.741
This is not a pimple.
This is fibrous.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.543
There's cords attached,
there's things happening.

12:59.544 --> 13:02.546
You're right. It is serious.
They should make a movie
about it.

13:02.547 --> 13:05.916
<i>Indiana tim</i>
<i>and the pimple of doom.</i>

13:07.652 --> 13:09.653
Ok, make your stupid jokes.

13:09.654 --> 13:14.324
Ok. Two pimples walk
into a bar...

13:14.325 --> 13:16.326
I'm not laughing
at this stuff.

13:16.327 --> 13:18.562
Tomorrow, I'm calling
every doctor I know.

13:18.563 --> 13:21.699
Cardiologists, radiologists,
anesthesiologists,
orthopedic...

13:21.700 --> 13:25.202
Would you stop acting
like your whole life
is gonna come to an end?

13:25.203 --> 13:27.438
End, end, end. Good.
Proctologist.

13:51.696 --> 13:54.732
What are you doing?
What does it look
like I'm doing?

13:54.733 --> 13:56.801
Losing your mind.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.202
What does that thing
look like right there?

13:59.203 --> 14:03.140
It's a pimple.
The whole seventh grade
is covered with them.

14:03.141 --> 14:06.376
Maybe you're right.

14:06.377 --> 14:09.079
Although,
from this angle,

14:09.080 --> 14:11.649
It does kinda look
like a boil.

14:16.254 --> 14:18.789
Here are the candles.
That looks good.
Hey, mom.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.024
Hey.
<i>(sniffs)</i>

14:21.025 --> 14:22.793
What's that smell?

14:22.794 --> 14:26.997
It's your father's
birthday dinner,
thank you very much.

14:26.998 --> 14:31.969
It usually
doesn't smell that bad
till an hour <i>after</i> he eats.

14:34.573 --> 14:38.809
It's cauliflower.
Would you guys set the table?

14:38.810 --> 14:41.078
Your dad wants
to eat healthier,

14:41.079 --> 14:43.581
So I'm making
steamed vegetables,
rice, chicken

14:43.582 --> 14:45.816
And birthday watermelon
for dessert.

14:45.817 --> 14:47.818
Just because dad
thinks he's dying,

14:47.819 --> 14:50.888
Why do we have to suffer?

14:50.889 --> 14:53.390
Dad isn't really gonna die,
is he?

14:53.391 --> 14:57.060
No, honey. He's probably
gonna live forever.

14:57.061 --> 14:59.563
He's already survived fire,
electrocution

14:59.564 --> 15:03.000
And crashing
through a porta potti.

15:03.001 --> 15:04.502
Then why is he so worried?

15:04.503 --> 15:07.371
Honey, your father
will get through this.

15:07.372 --> 15:11.274
You know, all guys go
a little off the deep end
when they hit 40.

15:11.275 --> 15:15.713
They get insecure, they obsess
about every gray hair...

15:29.594 --> 15:35.065
...And pimples in places
I don't even wanna know about.

15:47.378 --> 15:49.813
Hi, wilson.

15:49.814 --> 15:53.450
Howdy, neighbor.
Working on a flush?
What?

15:53.451 --> 15:55.986
I see you're holding
a pair of spades.

15:55.987 --> 15:58.088
<i>(chuckles)</i>

15:58.089 --> 16:00.591
Oh, I kill myself.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.961
Speaking of that,
I feel like my body's
falling apart.

16:03.962 --> 16:07.130
Really? Seems to me
you've always been
in excellent health.

16:07.131 --> 16:09.900
I was till hardware harry
turned into heart attack harry.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.670
Oh, yes, indeed.
I heard about that.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.406
Hmm. How's he doing, tim?
Oh, he's just fine.

16:16.407 --> 16:20.477
I don't know about me, though.
This really affected me, wilson.

16:20.478 --> 16:22.479
I can understand
your reaction.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.348
15 years ago, I was affected
by a similar event.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.651
Someone close to you
had a heart attack?
Oh, yes.

16:27.652 --> 16:30.888
Someone very close. Me.

16:30.889 --> 16:34.792
What? You never told me
you had a heart attack.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.127
Mm-hmm.
What happened?

16:37.128 --> 16:39.630
An acute thrombus
occluded my myocardial artery,

16:39.631 --> 16:43.400
Which was already
partially obstructed
by sclerotic plaque.

16:43.401 --> 16:45.903
Were you not eating right
or not exercising?

16:45.904 --> 16:47.905
No. Even before
my heart attack,

16:47.906 --> 16:50.407
I enjoyed
quite the same lifestyle
as I do now.

16:50.408 --> 16:53.310
I ate well,
got plenty of rest,
I exercised regularly.

16:53.311 --> 16:57.447
What about stress?
I didn't have any stress.
You hadn't moved in yet.

16:57.448 --> 16:58.983
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:58.984 --> 17:01.051
Um, how did you deal
with it?

17:01.052 --> 17:03.687
If it happened to me,
I wouldn't be able
to get out of bed.

17:03.688 --> 17:06.189
For a long while there,
tim, I couldn't.

17:06.190 --> 17:08.191
I refused to take any risks.

17:08.192 --> 17:11.261
I even canceled
my long-awaited trek
up mount kilimanjaro.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.262
That was a good choice.

17:13.263 --> 17:16.733
You don't wanna climb anything
that starts with the words
"kill a man."

17:16.734 --> 17:19.169
Actually, tim,
after a while I did go,

17:19.170 --> 17:21.939
And it was
one of the highlights
of my life.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.340
What made you
change your mind?

17:24.342 --> 17:26.710
I realized how lucky I was.

17:26.711 --> 17:29.880
My heart attack didn't kill me,
so why act like it did?

17:29.881 --> 17:33.884
<i>(grunts)</i> well, well, well...

17:33.885 --> 17:36.286
The roman rhetorician seneca
once said,

17:36.287 --> 17:41.091
"if we let things terrify us,
then life is not worth living."

17:41.092 --> 17:44.895
Shouldn't make a mountain
out of a... Pimple.

17:44.896 --> 17:49.399
Or any kind
of epidermal oddity.
Happy birthday, tim.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.435
Thanks, wilson.

17:56.808 --> 17:58.876
Jill...

17:58.877 --> 18:01.879
Did you know that wilson
had a heart attack
15 years ago?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.580
He did? Oh, no.

18:03.581 --> 18:06.383
You're not gonna get all crazy
about that now, are you?

18:06.384 --> 18:09.219
No. He's ok with it
and so am I.

18:09.220 --> 18:14.524
Apparently, he listened
to an old rotary named sonoco,

18:14.525 --> 18:16.960
Said, "life isn't really
worth living

18:16.961 --> 18:20.698
If you have to pay
for electricity
while you're in rome."

18:23.902 --> 18:26.369
Is it worth living
if you're a tool man?

18:26.370 --> 18:28.839
I overreacted with harry.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.508
He's not me, and I do
take care of myself,

18:31.509 --> 18:34.211
Which is probably why
you were teasing me so much.

18:34.212 --> 18:37.715
Well, to tell you the truth,
that crack about
pimple of doom

18:37.716 --> 18:39.850
Was a little mean-spirited.

18:39.851 --> 18:42.820
<i>(both)</i> but funny.
Yeah.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.423
You're starting to act like me.
When in doubt, go for the joke.

18:46.424 --> 18:49.059
Well, it is a good way
to deal with things

18:49.060 --> 18:51.028
That are uncomfortable.

18:51.029 --> 18:55.799
I didn't like hearing you talk
about not being around.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.634
Ah, so you like
having me around?

18:57.635 --> 19:01.438
Well...
Let's put it this way.

19:01.439 --> 19:03.941
I put so much hard work
into you,

19:03.942 --> 19:07.010
I'd like to enjoy
the fruits of my labor.

19:16.254 --> 19:20.423
Enjoy that?
Very fruity.

19:20.424 --> 19:23.627
Oh, oh. I have some news
that you will enjoy.

19:23.628 --> 19:25.963
Your medical team called...
Let me see.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.933
...And reported the following.
No, no, no. I wanna read it.

19:29.934 --> 19:32.502
Your cholesterol is low.

19:32.503 --> 19:35.305
Blood pressure perfect.

19:35.306 --> 19:39.376
You have the heart rate
of a marathon runner.

19:39.377 --> 19:42.045
Your pimple is a pimple.

19:42.046 --> 19:45.149
And... You are not pregnant.

19:48.753 --> 19:51.155
I was so hopeful.

19:53.124 --> 19:55.625
That's good news.
I'm a lucky guy.

19:55.626 --> 19:58.796
Got three great kids.
And a great wife.

19:58.797 --> 20:02.432
And a great wife.
And a great hot rod.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.735
I never thought I'd ever have
a hot rod that beautiful,
that gorgeous...

20:05.736 --> 20:08.205
Let's get back
to that wife thing, ok?

20:08.206 --> 20:10.507
And my wife.
Yeah, your wife.

20:10.508 --> 20:13.010
I'm glad I turned 40
with you,

20:13.011 --> 20:15.745
And I'll be glad
when I turn 80 with you,

20:15.746 --> 20:19.683
'cause by then
the boys will be gone,

20:19.684 --> 20:24.188
And we can go out to the garage
any time we want.

20:24.189 --> 20:28.892
Except by then
we'll need jumper cables
to get started.

20:42.006 --> 20:44.808
Are you still gonna
kiss like that when you're 80?

20:44.809 --> 20:46.877
It'll be better.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.512
I won't have my teeth
to get in the way.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.355
Hey.

20:58.356 --> 20:59.823
Hey.

20:59.824 --> 21:02.226
This is a guy
made out of tools.
Look at this.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.361
Yeah, it's a tool man
for the tool man.

21:04.362 --> 21:06.363
And we made it
all by ourselves.

21:06.364 --> 21:09.333
This is wonderful.
Look what they did.
Dad, check this out.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.235
Hey!
<i>(jill chuckles)</i>

21:11.236 --> 21:13.237
Beer and corn nuts.

21:13.238 --> 21:17.174
Needle-nose pliers.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.343
These are my tools.

21:19.344 --> 21:23.380
Well, you always say,
"when it comes to tools,
use the best."

21:25.449 --> 21:27.918
This is great, guys.
This is really great.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.787
Honey, it's gonna take a lot
to top this.

21:30.788 --> 21:33.891
I think
I'm up to the challenge.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.927
Are you over
your fear of death?
Yes.

21:36.928 --> 21:41.098
You wanna live life
to its fullest?
Uh-huh.

21:41.099 --> 21:44.834
What is the one thing
that you have always wanted?

21:44.835 --> 21:46.970
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:48.739 --> 21:51.541

I'm trying
to make a point here.

22:17.668 --> 22:19.669
I gotta start eating better.

said 40-year-old men

what to say.

Middle-aged.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.848
I gotta start eating better.

said 40-year-olds...
