-Whatever happened flipped a switch.
-You'll kill me.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.300
I'm fixed now. Everything's perfect.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.428
JOHN: I'm not sure you can control it.
-I won't let that happen.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.639
I lived in Mexico.
That's where we're going.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.100
-I can get her to tell me the truth.
-Stay away.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.851
I don't think I can do this.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.812
-What if I want out?
-There is no out.

00:20.979 --> 00:25.191
You are here to keep
John Connor away from her.

Riley.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.583
You shouldn't nest in the chimney.

You're migratory.
You need to find a mate.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.059
That's a window, bird.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.573
What am I going to do with you?

01:19.204 --> 01:22.165
A bird in a chimney is a fire hazard.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.792
I'm not supposed to kill you.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.337
But you can't stay here.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.009
Go.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.270
I was wondering
when we'd see you again.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.107
They make you rest a couple days.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.444
Does it help?

02:33.779 --> 02:35.780
Not really.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.458
Is there any more somewhere?

02:48.126 --> 02:51.003
Yeah. Downstairs, under the sink.

Did she say something?

03:19.283 --> 03:21.284
She asked me about it.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.995
To be nice, I think.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.540
Well, it's nobody's business.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.251
Well, it shouldn't have happened here.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.795
Or not at all.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.800
It's in the past.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.845
People don't forget about the past.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.855
I'm not saying forget it.

Didn't I just help you with something
this morning in the shower?

There's a guy,
he's got some information I need.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.294
There was a stack of research here,

The one who set up
the drone shell company.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.756

-While you were gone.

-...the day she tried to kill herself?
-She was very upset. John could tell.

-She had a bruise.
-Who gave her the bruise?

07:34.329 --> 07:37.248
John thought it was her foster dad.
She said it was a door.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.666
Liar. Then what?

07:38.834 --> 07:41.502
Riley cut her wrists like this.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.421
She almost bled to death.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.883
Do you think it was her foster dad?

We don't know much about Riley.

-I know where she lives.

-A bird did that?
-No, I did that. Look.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.273
The bird experienced
an involuntary movement of my fingers.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.485
It was fragile.

Yeah, there's damage,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.000
I don't know how it happened.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.710
It was probably during a fight.

-The metal?
-She cut her wrist.

Why did it cut itself?

what happened to Riley.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.349
What's John say?

13:30.685 --> 13:33.979
Getting anything out of that boy

she seemed upset that day...

He stays with us sometimes.

...hanging around a pretty teenage girl
who's so desperate for attention?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.947
What, did she say something
about him?

17:54.115 --> 17:56.616
She might have.
If she did, it's confidential.

Whatever's going on with this girl,
he's trying to be her friend.

-He's trying to help her.
-Like by taking her to Mexico?

18:10.173 --> 18:11.339
Mexico?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.967

took a trip to Mexico.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.013
I don't have to tell you that transporting
a minor across the border...

18:18.181 --> 18:21.433
...without her parents' permission
is a federal offense.

I didn't know.
Obviously, I will talk to my son.

I'm not out to get anyone here.

18:32.737 --> 18:36.615
My sense is that you're a decent person
and hard-working mom.

I'm a big believer in keeping
your own house in order.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.663
So why don't I let you handle this
your way?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.832
For now.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.752
I'd appreciate that.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.380
Consider it done.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.821
Cameron, did you...?

40:51.699 --> 40:52.825
You know I didn't.

41:01.668 --> 41:05.003
What have you been doing?
You've been out here for hours.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.339
Making something.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.007
For you.

41:14.347 --> 41:18.976
-What is it?
-You tried to fix me twice now.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.104
-It's not working.
-And?

41:22.438 --> 41:24.857
I'm not capable of self-termination.

41:26.317 --> 41:30.779
-Suicide.
-I can't kill myself, but you can.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.868
Why would I wanna kill you?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.287
You might have to someday.

41:42.876 --> 41:46.170
I've planted an explosive in my skull
near my chip.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.255
It's a small amount, but it's enough.

41:56.681 --> 41:57.764
Enough?

42:04.439 --> 42:07.733
All you have to do is hit the switch.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.746
What would Future John do now?

42:22.290 --> 42:26.126
Future John doesn't live here,
you do.
