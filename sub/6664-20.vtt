00:00.567 --> 00:02.768
Adult adam: <i> Anyone who has</i>
<i> a big brother will tell you</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:05.504
<i> That quality time</i>
<i> together looks like this.</i>
(groaning)

00:05.506 --> 00:08.807
<i> But my brother, barry,</i>
<i> took it to another level.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:11.677
Atomic elbow drop!
(adam grunts)

00:11.679 --> 00:12.478
Come here!

00:12.480 --> 00:14.947
<i> Most big brothers were content</i>
<i> with wedgies and noogies,</i>

00:14.949 --> 00:16.148
No!
<i> But not mine.</i>

00:16.150 --> 00:17.583
<i> There was the butt hat...</i>

00:17.585 --> 00:19.785
Oh! Look, your new hat
fits perfectly.

00:19.787 --> 00:23.355
<i> The waffle belly...</i>
Smells like
home cooking.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.990
Adam: Why are you like this?

00:24.992 --> 00:26.158
We're gonna get
some waffles.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.728
<i> And the one I wouldn't wish</i>
<i> on my worst enemy...</i>

00:29.730 --> 00:30.929
<i> The jock-xygen mask.</i>

00:30.931 --> 00:33.665
Yeah.
Breathe it in.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.400
(muffled scream)

00:34.402 --> 00:37.336
<i> And like any tormenter,</i>
<i> barry fell in love with a show</i>

00:37.338 --> 00:40.739
<i> That made beating people up</i>
<i> an art form.</i>

00:40.741 --> 00:41.907
(all cheering)

00:41.909 --> 00:43.175
That hurt.
That hurt.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.576
What are you watching?

00:44.578 --> 00:45.511
<i> American gladiators.</i>

00:45.513 --> 00:47.780
It mixes showbiz,
patriotism,

00:47.782 --> 00:50.082
And spandex for a trifecta
of viewing pleasure.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.718
They pit grossly
muscular warriors
with cartoonish names

00:52.720 --> 00:56.422
Against accountants
and dental hygienists
in feats of strength.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.624
Wow! So many new
and creative ways

00:58.626 --> 00:59.792
For people
to hurt each other.

00:59.794 --> 01:00.793
Adult adam:
<i> And barry wasted no time</i>

01:00.795 --> 01:03.595
<i> Using those new and creative</i>
<i> ways to hurt someone...</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.764
<i> Me.</i>
Why?

01:05.766 --> 01:07.332
You've been gladiated.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.635
That's not even a word!

01:09.869 --> 01:10.436
Whoo!

01:10.438 --> 01:13.172
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, barry didn't just watch</i>
gladiators, <i> he lived it.</i>

01:13.174 --> 01:16.075
<i> When he'd hang out</i>
<i> with the jenkintown posse,</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:17.976
<i> It's all they talked about.</i>

01:17.978 --> 01:18.911
Whoo!
(cheering)

01:18.913 --> 01:22.114
Goldberg!
Reigning champion
of powerball.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.315
You destroyed
that food!

01:23.317 --> 01:24.917
Yeah!
And scratched
my retina.

01:24.919 --> 01:28.287
I'm unstoppable.
I own this parking lot.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.856
Sure do, bro.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.224
Oh, crap.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.493
Adult adam:
<i> It was the meadowbrook mafia,</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:37.629
<i> A rival wannabe posse</i>
<i> from the next town over.</i>

01:37.631 --> 01:39.264
The meadowbrook
mafia.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.399
Those guys
are crazy.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.533
Yo,
I know their leader.

01:41.535 --> 01:45.537
He got kicked out
of my tennis camp
for disruptive behavior.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.774
Look who it is.
The jenkinturd posse.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.110
Shut up, bradley.
You know it's jenkintown.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.845
Hey, why don't you
take your ice cream

01:52.847 --> 01:55.247
And go back to that stupid
friendly's parking lot

01:55.249 --> 01:57.049
You always
hang out at?
Bradley: Can't.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.584
It got converted
to a daycare center,

01:58.586 --> 02:00.419
And they don't take
too kindly to loiterers.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.388
That means we got to
kick your lame crew
out of here.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.156
(scoffs) lame?

02:04.158 --> 02:06.925
We got madman schwartz,
naked rob,

02:06.927 --> 02:10.662
And the original ladies' man,
andy cogan.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.564
Hide your sisters,
boys.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.466
But, truth be told,
I respect women.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.001
You got nothing
on my crew.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.371
We got psycho mikowitz,
diagnosed with
mild depression.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.406
It's a constant numbness,
yo.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.208
That's josh millstein-chang.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.410
Yes,
of millstein-chang toyota.

02:25.412 --> 02:26.411
And subaru.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.980
And that's dumb doug.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.549
Don't be fooled.
It's an ironic nickname.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.751
Brandeis early admission,
holmes!

02:32.753 --> 02:35.053
So beat it or eat it.
Barry: Hey.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.824
Everyone knows
that the jtp territory

02:38.826 --> 02:40.292
Runs from this wawa

02:40.294 --> 02:44.997
All the way down
to that weird church.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.736
Not anymore.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.604
Boop! (laughs)
mikowitz: Ooh!

02:52.606 --> 02:54.706
Sweet treat
to the face!

02:54.708 --> 02:56.041
Come on, barry.
Do something.

02:56.043 --> 02:59.378
Andy: Don't take that, man.
Go. Come on.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.346
That's
what I thought.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.215
Adult adam:
<i> For the first time</i>
<i> in his life,</i>

03:03.217 --> 03:05.584
<i> Barry was faced</i>
<i> with an opponent</i>
<i> that he couldn't defeat</i>

03:05.586 --> 03:07.452
<i> With a butt hat</i>
<i> or a waffle belly.</i>

03:07.454 --> 03:09.755
Let's go, boys.
(chuckles)

03:09.757 --> 03:10.522
He booped me.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.058
He booped an ice-cream cone
on my nose,

03:13.060 --> 03:14.626
And I just stood there
and took it.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.295
There's no coming back
from that.

03:16.297 --> 03:16.995
Oh, yes, there is.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.998
Back in the army,
I was a welterweight boxer.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.234
Now, I can teach you
everything I know,

03:22.236 --> 03:23.902
But it's gonna take
a lot of hard work and...

03:23.904 --> 03:25.837
Enough!
Adult adam: <i> But barry</i>
<i> didn't like hard work.</i>

03:25.839 --> 03:29.174
<i> He liked stupid,</i>
<i> convoluted plans.</i>

03:29.176 --> 03:31.443
There's only
one logical thing to do.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.811
I will become
nationally known

03:32.813 --> 03:34.947
As television's
greatest warrior,

03:34.949 --> 03:36.848
And that parking lot
will be mine.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.284
I thought we were gonna do
a whole thing together.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.587
We are not.
Adam!

03:41.589 --> 03:43.555
Whatever it is, no.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.023
Now, go get
your nerdy video camera.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.326
I got to make myself
an audition tape.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.093
Why would I help you?

03:48.095 --> 03:50.462
All you do is
make my life
a living hell.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.765
If you don't help me,
it'll get a lot worse.
Mark my words.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.903
There'll be
no butt un-wedgied,
no willy un-wetted,

03:57.905 --> 03:58.870
And no nurple un-purpled.

03:58.872 --> 04:03.442
It'll be a 24-hour-a-day,
full-body beatdown.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.444
(groans)
fine. I'll do it.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.513
Yes!
Time to get pumped!

04:08.515 --> 04:10.249
Celebratory butt hat!

04:10.251 --> 04:11.216
No!
(thudding)

04:11.218 --> 04:13.018
Adam: This is not
a celebration!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.519
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

04:14.521 --> 04:18.457
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

04:20.627 --> 04:21.727
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

04:21.729 --> 04:25.130
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

04:25.132 --> 04:26.865
Adult adam: <i> It was</i>
<i> November 2, 1980-something,</i>

04:26.867 --> 04:31.236
<i> And the presidential election</i>
<i> between reagan and mondale</i>
<i> was heating up.</i>

04:31.238 --> 04:33.772
<i> But the real debate</i>
<i> was in our living room.</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:35.474
Everything you're saying
is wrong!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.743
There's only one choice,
and it's mondale.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.545
That nerd
can't compete with reagan.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.813
Reagan likes jelly beans.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.182
He's got the hair
of a greek god.

04:44.184 --> 04:44.916
What's not to like?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.785
Well, I care
about the issues.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.421
There's only one issue
that matters in this race,

04:49.423 --> 04:50.188
And that's taxes.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.691
Mondale specifically said
he would raise them.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.227
That's all you care about?
Taxes?

04:55.229 --> 04:55.560
Yes!

04:55.562 --> 04:57.863
Why do you think we had adam?
He was a write-off.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.165
Murray, change the channel.
<i> T.J. Hooker's</i> on.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.768
Mom, we're talking about
important issues right now.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.902
Who are you
gonna vote for?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.470
Murray,
who am I gonna vote for?

05:05.472 --> 05:06.204
Reagan.
Reagan.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.839
Mom, you can't just
blindly follow what dad says.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.176
Your father makes me
a little cheat sheet.
What do you call it, mur?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.511
"murray's picks."
"murray's picks."

05:12.513 --> 05:15.180
(groans) how do you not
care about the world at all?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.848
What are you doing
trying to rile up your mother?

05:16.850 --> 05:19.084
What's wrong?
You afraid I'm gonna
make mom a free thinker

05:19.086 --> 05:21.586
And inspire her to go
make a real difference?
Yes!

05:21.588 --> 05:24.323
Whenever she gets passionate
about something,

05:24.325 --> 05:25.190
She makes me do stuff.

05:25.192 --> 05:28.927
And the last thing
I want to do in life... Stuff.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.362
Mom,
this affects all of us.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.932
Mondale's vice president
will be geraldine ferraro...

05:33.934 --> 05:36.168
A woman
in the white house.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.338
Oh, wow. Amazing.
It really is.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.572
I mean,
that heather locklear

05:40.574 --> 05:42.407
Sure has a way
with a feather brush.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.710
Her hair doesn't even move
when she kicks a gang member.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.579
Adult adam:
<i> While erica was trying</i>
<i> to educate my mom</i>

05:47.581 --> 05:48.313
<i> About the outside world,</i>

05:48.315 --> 05:51.283
<i> My delusional brother</i>
<i> was ready to show the universe</i>

05:51.285 --> 05:53.218
<i> Just how tough he really was.</i>

05:53.220 --> 05:53.585
Okay.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.355
Now it's time for me
to demonstrate my superiority

05:56.357 --> 05:59.524
In all the official
<i> american gladiator</i> events.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.526
Roll camera.

06:02.595 --> 06:05.263
Go ahead...
Take a whack at my face.

06:05.265 --> 06:09.901
Wait. You want me to hit you,
and you won't hit back?

06:09.903 --> 06:10.602
Oh, no.

06:10.604 --> 06:14.005
I will stand here
like a steel mountain.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.775
Adult adam: <i> After a lifetime</i>
<i> of taking barry beatings,</i>

06:16.777 --> 06:19.544
<i> It was finally my turn</i>
<i> to dish it out.</i>

06:19.546 --> 06:21.780
(soft thuds)

06:21.782 --> 06:22.714
Stop! Ow!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.950
That's too much!
Ow!

06:24.952 --> 06:26.418
(lisping)
I'm biting my tongue!

06:26.420 --> 06:29.221
Ow! Right in the ear hole!
Time out!

06:29.223 --> 06:32.157
<i> Years of bottled-up anger</i>
<i> came flooding out,</i>

06:32.159 --> 06:34.626
<i> And it felt amazing!</i>

06:34.894 --> 06:37.562
Next up... The assault.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.563
Ahhh!
I wasn't ready!

06:38.565 --> 06:42.134
You think nitro's gonna wait
till you're ready?
Now dance!

06:42.136 --> 06:44.703
Hold fire!
Stop! Ow!

06:44.705 --> 06:46.872
That hurts! Stop!

06:47.807 --> 06:50.075
(groans)
stop! Hold fire!

06:50.077 --> 06:50.742
Ow!

06:50.744 --> 06:55.147
I now give you
the human cannonball.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.048
Let's do this!

06:57.050 --> 06:59.217
Three...Two...One.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.052
Ahhh!

07:02.054 --> 07:03.155
(groans)

07:03.157 --> 07:04.122
Did you at least
get the shot?

07:04.124 --> 07:07.993
(groans) the lens cap was on.
We should go again.

07:07.995 --> 07:08.860
Erica: Read it.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.930
It's everything you need
to know about the election.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.064
Or I could do something
meaningful

07:13.066 --> 07:17.068
And bake my special
double-marshmallow fudgy
nut butterscotch bars.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.671
No. There's a whole world
outside of this house.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.273
Don't you want to make it
a better place

07:21.275 --> 07:22.808
For your children
and grandchildren?

07:22.810 --> 07:25.644
Ohhh! You're gonna give me
grandbabies! Ohhh.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.845
You're not
pregnant now?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.648
No! Mom, focus.
You need to get political.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.850
This is exactly
why I joined
the politics club

07:31.852 --> 07:33.251
And signed up
for the mock debate.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.853
I thought you said
the kids in that club

07:34.855 --> 07:36.221
Were disturbing
to the senses.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.590
Yeah. That club's like
god's junk drawer.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.726
Point is, my stock
at school is plummeting,

07:41.728 --> 07:42.894
And I don't even care.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.095
That's how much
this matters.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.665
So please,
just give it a read.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.365
All right, all right.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.468
If it means that much to you,
I'll give it a look.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.937
Adult adam:
<i> All erica wanted to do</i>
<i> was teach my mom</i>

07:51.939 --> 07:53.004
<i> That politics</i>
<i> could change the world.</i>

07:53.006 --> 07:57.175
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> beverly goldberg was a much</i>
<i> more eager student</i>

07:57.177 --> 07:58.477
<i> Than erica expected.</i>

07:58.479 --> 08:01.079
Oh, my god! What?
Schmoo, there is a woman

08:01.081 --> 08:02.948
Who's gonna change
the course of our nation,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.749
And I need
to get behind her.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.517
Geraldine ferraro?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.451
Nancy reagan!
Say what, now?

08:06.453 --> 08:10.322
I mean, she is a real spitfire
with a killer fashion sense.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.357
You know,
not everyone can pull off

08:12.359 --> 08:13.358
A red skirt suit like us.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.628
Forget the suit.
What about
the actual politician...

08:16.630 --> 08:17.262
Geraldine ferraro?

08:17.264 --> 08:20.098
Oh, that woman with
the awful bowl cut?
Blech!

08:20.100 --> 08:21.099
Don't you "blech" her.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.368
It's not about her hair.
It's about her issues.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.804
Well, her number-one issue
should be that hair.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.638
Her hair is fine!

08:26.640 --> 08:28.273
I agree it's not great,
but it's fine!

08:28.275 --> 08:31.943
Nancy is just like me.
She calls all the shots.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.646
She loves kids.
She hates crack rock.

08:34.648 --> 08:38.350
She even has her own
anti-drug campaign...

08:38.352 --> 08:40.318
"just say no."

08:40.320 --> 08:41.486
"just say no"?

08:41.488 --> 08:42.087
"just say no."

08:42.089 --> 08:43.855
I didn't know
it was that easy.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.056
Let me just call
betty ford

08:45.058 --> 08:46.324
And tell her
to shut the clinic down.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.960
I think I'm gonna go down
to the local campaign office

08:48.962 --> 08:50.862
And start handing out
"just say no" t-shirts.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.299
I cannot thank you
enough for opening
my eyes to this, erica.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.435
I hate drugs
so (bleep) much!

08:57.437 --> 08:58.436
(chuckles)

08:58.438 --> 08:59.104
But I love you.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.139
Adult adam: <i> Erica had lit</i>
<i> a spark in my mom,</i>

09:01.141 --> 09:03.642
<i> And it was about to spread</i>
<i> like wildfire.</i>

09:03.644 --> 09:07.078
Hello, and welcome
to the mock
presidential debate.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.347
Boy: (in audience)
you suck!

09:09.349 --> 09:10.949
Mike safris is reagan.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.286
Erica goldberg
is miss walter mondale.

09:14.288 --> 09:18.056
But before we begin,
we have a special guest

09:18.058 --> 09:20.592
Who has forced me
to allow her to speak

09:20.594 --> 09:22.827
On behalf
of our first lady...

09:22.829 --> 09:23.495
Mrs. Goldberg.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.997
Oh, sweet dear lord
in heaven, no.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.198
Look at me, boopie.
I'm all political.
(chuckles)

09:27.200 --> 09:29.434
Adult adam: <i> That's right.</i>
<i> In the world's most</i>
<i> misguided attempt</i>

09:29.436 --> 09:32.804
<i> To make erica proud,</i>
<i> my mom had gotten</i>
<i> politically active.</i>

09:32.806 --> 09:35.106
Set it up
like we rehearsed.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.309
<i> Way, way too active.</i>

09:37.311 --> 09:37.876
Hello, teens.

09:37.878 --> 09:42.213
I'd like to speak to you
about nancy reagan's
"just say no" campaign

09:42.215 --> 09:46.952
Through a little role-playing
scenario that I wrote myself.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.554
Hi,
popular football player.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.355
I'm a local tough

09:50.357 --> 09:54.859
Who slings dope cigarettes
outside this very high school.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.262
Would you like drugs?

09:57.264 --> 09:57.996
What will I do?

09:57.998 --> 10:00.632
My teenage mind is soft
and easily persuaded

10:00.634 --> 10:02.567
By peer pressure
and the need to fit in.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.169
Adult adam:
<i> For the next 35 minutes,</i>

10:04.171 --> 10:05.537
<i> My mom</i>
<i> passionately inhabited</i>

10:05.539 --> 10:06.805
<i> The role of spider,</i>
<i> the drug pusher,</i>

10:06.807 --> 10:11.376
<i> In what became</i>
<i> the most embarrassing moment</i>
<i> of my sister's life.</i>

10:11.378 --> 10:13.078
Beverly:
Be cool, homey.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.613
I've got booger sugar,

10:14.615 --> 10:15.680
Goofballs, poppers,

10:15.682 --> 10:19.384
Uppers, downers, ludes,
wammers, and jammers.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.420
What do you say,
impressionable teenager?

10:22.422 --> 10:23.355
Let's chase the dragon.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.590
No. I just say no
to drugs.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.424
And scene.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.827
(scattered applause)
vote reagan, everyone.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.430
Wow. Well, thank you
very much for that,
mrs. Goldberg.

10:32.432 --> 10:36.735
Unfortunately, uh,
we no longer have time
for our debate.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
What?
(audience cheering)

10:38.805 --> 10:41.139
Adult adam:
<i> Yep. Erica realized</i>
<i> our dad was right.</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:45.677
<i> You never, ever encourage</i>
<i> beverly goldberg.</i>

10:45.778 --> 10:49.914
<i> After the debate,</i>
<i> erica thought my mom was done</i>
<i> with her war on drugs.</i>

10:49.916 --> 10:53.184
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> she was just getting started.</i>

10:53.186 --> 10:53.752
Again, nothing.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.656
We have some books,
lacrosse sticks,
scissors, glue.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.124
You sad, naive man.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.358
What's this,
keith richards?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.161
You gonna sniff it
so you can trip out?

11:03.163 --> 11:04.295
Would that work?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.164
Mom,
what are you doing?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.266
Locker searches?
Are you kidding me?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.834
The whole school
is calling me a narc.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.438
"narc" is just
another word for "hero."
(chuckles)

11:13.440 --> 11:16.307
I'm getting involved,
just like you said.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.475
I just love politics.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.444
This has nothing
to do with politics.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.846
Nancy reagan
isn't running for president.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.349
She's just a clueless
housewife, like you.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.886
Now, stop ruining my life
and go home!

11:27.888 --> 11:29.287
I think
she's on the glue stick.

11:29.289 --> 11:34.225
Adult adam:
<i> Erica was desperately trying</i>
<i> to crush my mom's enthusiasm.</i>

11:34.227 --> 11:35.160
Be careful
with that tape.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.194
It's gonna
make my brother famous.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.196
Adult adam: <i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> I was sending off a package</i>

11:38.198 --> 11:39.631
<i> That would crush</i>
<i> barry's dreams.</i>

11:39.633 --> 11:41.966
I hate to break it to you,
but I saw that tape.

11:41.968 --> 11:46.304
I...I don't think
it shows your brother
in the best light.

11:46.306 --> 11:46.905
Don't worry.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.275
It'll get barry
on america's greatest tv show.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.243
Just not the one
you'd think.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.648
<i> We will show no clip</i>
<i> before its time.</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:58.283
<i> It's time.</i>

11:58.484 --> 11:59.517
(man on tv groans)
(adam chuckles)

11:59.519 --> 12:03.254
That happy father
got punched in the pistachios

12:03.256 --> 12:05.490
By a toddler
for no reason!

12:05.492 --> 12:08.927
This show changes
everything I know about funny.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.028
(screams)

12:10.030 --> 12:13.431
(laughs)
are you sure about this?

12:13.433 --> 12:16.101
I mean, you already
got to beat barry up

12:16.103 --> 12:17.535
In the backyard
all afternoon.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.305
Do you really need to
humiliate him on national tv?

12:20.307 --> 12:23.174
One afternoon of hitting him
with a stick doesn't make up

12:23.176 --> 12:26.611
For a lifetime
of waffle bellies
and butt hats.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.481
By tomorrow, barry's bruises
will have healed,

12:29.483 --> 12:32.016
But revenge like this
stays forever.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.818
But at what price?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.053
10 grand if I win.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.554
Yo! Ad-rock!

12:36.556 --> 12:37.856
How's editing going?

12:37.858 --> 12:38.890
Did you add in
those fireballs

12:38.892 --> 12:40.492
And karate-chop
sound effects
like I asked?

12:40.494 --> 12:44.229
Oh, yeah! It was so good,
I already shipped it off.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.730
Without even
showing it to me first?

12:45.732 --> 12:48.767
I didn't have a choice.
The deadline was tomorrow.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.435
Way to think ahead,
man!

12:50.437 --> 12:51.836
Once I get on
<i> american gladiators,</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:54.239
The meadowbrook mafia
will bow down
to my awesomeness

12:54.241 --> 12:56.441
And be forced to give us
our parking lot back.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.376
Sounds like
an airtight plan.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.712
(sighs) I know
I don't say this a lot, but...

13:00.714 --> 13:02.547
You really are
a good brother.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.015
You really don't need
to thank me.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.818
That's why I decided
to get you a little something.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.553
Here.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.821
That's the first day
we ever met.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.158
Mom and dad said
they were bringing me a gift
back from the hospital,

13:13.160 --> 13:15.927
And it turned out
to be you.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.564
You were the greatest gift
I ever got.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.966
Ooh.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.004
That's too nice
for the circumstances.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.172
I'm gonna go
hang out by the phone

13:27.174 --> 13:28.840
And wait for
the <i> gladiators</i> to call.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.709
You're the best,
ad-rock.

13:31.711 --> 13:32.677
We need
to get that tape back.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.913
Adult adam:
<i> While I was determined</i>
<i> to right my wrong,</i>

13:34.915 --> 13:36.281
<i> My mom was determined</i>
<i> to show erica</i>

13:36.283 --> 13:39.250
<i> She was anything</i>
<i> but a clueless housewife.</i>

13:39.252 --> 13:39.818
Erica: My god!

13:39.820 --> 13:43.087
What horrible thing
is happening
in my house right now?

13:43.089 --> 13:43.688
Something glorious.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.024
Your mother is
going to single-handedly

13:46.026 --> 13:47.058
Get the gipper re-elected.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.328
You can't get
reagan re-elected
just to spite me.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.196
Oh, I can, and I will.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.364
I will change
the course of history

13:53.366 --> 13:55.500
Just to show you
how clue-ful I am.

13:55.502 --> 13:59.637
So you'd turn
this great country into
a nightmarish hellscape

13:59.639 --> 14:00.605
Just to prove a point?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.540
Oh, yes, but it will be
a magical land

14:02.542 --> 14:06.578
Where president reagan
gives every american
free jelly beans,

14:06.580 --> 14:09.581
A world where sons
just say no to drugs

14:09.583 --> 14:13.952
And daughters say yes
to respecting their mothers.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.486
You know,
for the last two years,

14:15.488 --> 14:18.356
All I've cared about
is boys and clothes

14:18.358 --> 14:19.324
And what my friends think.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.461
And for once,
I got excited
about something real.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.263
I thought that I could make
a difference

14:25.265 --> 14:27.098
And get people
to see the world like I do.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.870
But you've proved that
I can't even do that
with my own mom.

14:31.872 --> 14:32.537
So...

14:32.539 --> 14:34.205
Thanks for ruining
the only thing

14:34.207 --> 14:36.040
I've cared about
in a long time.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.110
Adult adam:
<i> While my mom had realized</i>
<i> just how much she hurt erica,</i>

14:39.112 --> 14:44.082
<i> I was hoping pops</i>
<i> could help me</i>
<i> from hurting barry.</i>

14:44.550 --> 14:45.283
Oh, thank god.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.484
How did it go
at the post office?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.453
Did you seduce the mail lady
with your charms?

14:48.455 --> 14:50.688
She was built
like a steamer trunk.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.091
I'm not going out
that way, kid.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.259
What am I gonna do?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.094
I've called bob saget
a hundred times.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.295
His people
are icing me out.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.465
I hate to say it,
but I think you're gonna
have to bite the bullet

15:00.467 --> 15:02.433
And tell barry
what you did.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.268
I can't do that.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.803
He's your brother.
He'll understand.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.071
I will murder your face!

15:07.073 --> 15:09.774
Relax! There's no way
bob saget will pick your tape.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.776
All you did
was get relentlessly hit

15:11.778 --> 15:13.912
In the nose, head,
face, testicles...

15:13.914 --> 15:15.546
Oh, god.
He is gonna pick it.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.516
That's it! You are no longer
my favorite gift!

15:18.518 --> 15:19.117
Aw, don't say that.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.420
That honor now goes
to the stilts I got
for my birthday.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.488
I can't believe
you did this to me.

15:23.490 --> 15:27.558
What did you expect?
I was sick of
getting dead-legged

15:27.560 --> 15:28.960
And my belly waffled.

15:28.962 --> 15:29.694
It really hurts.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.430
And my skin
doesn't bounce back
the way it once did.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.499
But beating you up
is our thing!

15:34.501 --> 15:36.501
How is violence upon me
our thing?

15:36.503 --> 15:40.138
That's how we bond!
What else am I
supposed to do?

15:40.140 --> 15:40.772
Give you a hug?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.707
Yes!
A hug would be nice!

15:42.709 --> 15:44.842
A hug would feel good
on my body!

15:44.844 --> 15:48.146
Nipple cripples are my way
of showing you love, okay?

15:48.148 --> 15:48.813
It's how I hug you.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.982
But after this,
I'm never beating
you up again!

15:50.984 --> 15:54.152
Oh, come on.
You don't mean that.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.787
Give me
a nipple cripple.
Never!

15:55.789 --> 15:59.057
You'll never feel
the painful sting
of my touch again.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.694
Now, leave my room
quietly and safely.

16:05.164 --> 16:09.467
And please...
Watch your fingers!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.303
Adult adam:
<i> Barry would never forgive me</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:15.940
<i> For making a hilarious mockery</i>
<i> of his</i> gladiator <i> audition,</i>

16:15.942 --> 16:17.875
<i> But I had a way</i>
<i> to change that.</i>

16:17.877 --> 16:19.377
What do you want?

16:19.379 --> 16:19.978
Hey.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.313
I know you're mad,
and you deserve to be.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.016
But there's something
you need to see.

16:26.752 --> 16:27.285
(tape plays)

16:27.287 --> 16:30.455
Barry: (on tv)
<i> force! Force!</i>
<i> Force! Yeah!</i>

16:30.457 --> 16:33.057
<i> Pain! Pain!</i>
<i> Pain! Yeah!</i>

16:33.059 --> 16:34.826
<i> Yeah!</i>

16:35.194 --> 16:37.428
(grunting)

16:37.496 --> 16:39.030
<i> Yeah!</i>

16:39.032 --> 16:40.531
<i> No tennis ball</i>
<i> can hurt me!</i>

16:40.533 --> 16:43.735
<i> Bring it!</i>
(grunts)

16:43.902 --> 16:46.938
<i> Ahhh!</i>
<i> I feel nothing!</i>

16:46.940 --> 16:48.072
Adam: Look how tough
you are, man.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.308
If you could take
an ass-kicking like this,

16:50.310 --> 16:53.277
I know you can take
a hundred ice-cream boops

16:53.279 --> 16:54.345
From those
meadowbrook punks.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.016
You think one video's
gonna change the way
I feel about you?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.150
No.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.853
But you need to know
how I feel about you.

17:01.855 --> 17:02.453
You're the gift.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.423
I could have ended up
with any brother in the world,

17:05.425 --> 17:10.028
But mine is loud and tough
and emotionally unstable.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.197
But I wouldn't have it
any other way.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.033
Get the jtp
on the horn.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.402
We got a wawa
to conquer.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.505
Good heelwork,
millstein-chang.

17:20.839 --> 17:25.576
This is my sack now,
just like this is my wawa.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.780
Well, well.
Somebody grew a pair.

17:28.782 --> 17:29.414
(chuckles)

17:29.416 --> 17:31.049
Yo, dumb doug,
give me your soft serve.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.584
Okay, but you owe me
75 cent...

17:33.586 --> 17:36.454
Looks like someone's
cruisin' for a boopin'.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.790
I'm not afraid of you,
bradley cooper.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.391
I'm not afraid
of anything.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.959
What are you gonna do
with that, goldberg?

17:41.961 --> 17:45.463
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.231
(baltimora's <i> tarzan boy</i>
plays)

17:47.233 --> 17:49.100
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

17:49.102 --> 17:52.737
(yells)
bring the pain!

17:52.739 --> 17:53.504
Ahhh!

17:53.506 --> 17:56.674
Adult adam:
<i> And bring the pain he did.</i>

17:56.676 --> 17:57.208
Barry: Ahhh!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.677
Adult adam: <i> Barry booped,</i>
<i> batted, and beat himself up</i>
<i> pretty bad that day.</i>

17:59.679 --> 18:02.647
I...Am...
Emotionally...Un...Stable!

18:02.649 --> 18:03.714
<i> He reclaimed the wawa</i>

18:03.716 --> 18:06.217
<i> Using pure strength</i>
<i> and unreasonable power.</i>

18:06.219 --> 18:07.151
Get out of here!
Jtp!

18:07.153 --> 18:12.957
<i> Yep, there was only one</i>
<i> true</i> american gladiator...
<i> Barry goldberg.</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:18.129
Hey, sweetie.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.564
Debate's about
to come on tv.

18:19.566 --> 18:23.534
Pass.
I'm going with lainey
to the mall.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.369
I'm sorry, okay?

18:25.371 --> 18:27.905
I went overboard.

18:27.907 --> 18:28.306
(sighs)

18:28.308 --> 18:32.343
Y-you know, parents
always want their kids
to look up to them,

18:32.345 --> 18:34.011
But you've gotten
so smart,

18:34.013 --> 18:36.114
I'm the one
who looks up to you.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.483
I just wanted
to make you proud.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.650
You do make me proud.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.886
And just because
you don't share my opinion

18:41.888 --> 18:43.387
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.423
Even though you are.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.593
Erica: <i> That's right.</i>
<i> I will raise taxes,</i>

18:48.595 --> 18:52.497
Because nothing is free,
except this country...

18:52.499 --> 18:56.234
The greatest country
in the whole
friggin' universe.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.036
Adult adam:
<i> No one was prouder</i>
<i> than beverly goldberg.</i>

18:59.038 --> 18:59.937
<i> Seeing erica on that stage,</i>

18:59.939 --> 19:04.675
<i> My mom knew there was</i>
<i> no one else in the world</i>
<i> she'd rather look up to.</i>

19:05.110 --> 19:05.910
<i> ¶ night to night</i>

19:05.912 --> 19:08.079
Adult adam:
<i> We never found out</i>
<i> who mom voted for that year,</i>

19:08.081 --> 19:12.650
<i> But what we do know</i>
<i> is she never needed</i>
<i> a cheat sheet again.</i>

19:12.652 --> 19:14.852
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> the real election</i>

19:14.854 --> 19:17.788
<i> Didn't quite work out</i>
<i> the way erica hoped.</i>

19:17.790 --> 19:18.556
Look at that.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.424
Biggest landslide
in us history.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.394
You were right.
He should have lied
about taxes.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.631
All that work I put in,
and it was for nothing.

19:26.633 --> 19:30.301
You may have swayed
somebody at the debate.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.037
Wait. I got you
to vote for mondale?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.606
Tell me
you voted for mondale!

19:35.608 --> 19:36.207

19:36.209 --> 19:38.442

<i> from nothing</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:40.111
Dude!
It worked!

19:40.113 --> 19:41.412
We got the wawa back!

19:41.414 --> 19:43.381
Well, glad I could help.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.949
Cool.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.084
Cool. (chuckles)

19:47.152 --> 19:50.388
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh, oh-oh,</i>
<i> oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

19:50.390 --> 19:53.658
Adult adam: <i> Yeah, every family</i>
<i> shows their love</i>
<i> in crazy ways.</i>

19:53.660 --> 19:57.195
<i> Some brothers give noogies,</i>
<i> wedgies, and waffle bellies,</i>

19:57.197 --> 19:58.629
Ow! Stop!
It was a sweet moment!

19:58.631 --> 20:02.133
<i> And some moms take</i>
<i> "just say no"</i>
<i> to embarrassing extremes.</i>

20:02.135 --> 20:04.569
Stop showing me love!
Too much love! (laughs)

20:04.571 --> 20:06.237
<i> Sure, at the time,</i>
<i> you wish they never happened,</i>

20:06.239 --> 20:08.940
<i> But later, you look back</i>
<i> and wish you could relive</i>

20:08.942 --> 20:14.879
<i> Each and every wonderfully</i>
<i> painful moment one more time.</i>

20:16.715 --> 20:20.051
Do you know
what I want to talk about?

20:20.053 --> 20:24.689
Drugs... It's a ver...
Very bad thing to...Deal with.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.524
Here we have drugs.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.292
(bell dings)

20:28.294 --> 20:31.162
This thing can totally
destroy your mind.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.931
It's very bad for you!

20:33.933 --> 20:36.167
Drugs! Drugs!

20:36.368 --> 20:37.902
Drugs.

20:40.939 --> 20:44.442
Ahhh! He could be
seriously hurt right now!

20:44.444 --> 20:46.344
Why am I laughing?

20:47.179 --> 20:48.312
Look at this jamoke!

20:48.314 --> 20:51.148
You don't swing-dance
that close to a pool.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.718
You got to be a real putz
to get on this show.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.821
Bob saget: (on tv)
<i> I'll bet by now you've chosen</i>
<i> your favorite video,</i>

20:56.823 --> 20:59.690
<i> But not so fast, buster...</i>
<i> And busterettes.</i>

20:59.692 --> 21:00.691
<i> You haven't seen this one.</i>

21:00.693 --> 21:02.693
Barry: (on tv)
<i> stop! Hey!</i>
<i> That's too much!</i>

21:02.695 --> 21:03.761
(lisping)
<i> I'm biting my tongue!</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:05.596
<i> Ow! My back!</i>
<i> Please stop!</i>

21:05.598 --> 21:09.300
<i> Ahhh! I wasn't ready!</i>
(groans)

21:09.302 --> 21:10.668
Is that...
Oh, my god!

21:10.670 --> 21:14.105
I need to record this!
How do I record this?
Barry: Adam!

21:14.107 --> 21:18.009
I'm gonna show you
I love you
so hard right now!

21:18.011 --> 21:18.809
Ohhh! (laughs)

21:18.811 --> 21:22.146
Look!
Our baby's on tv!

21:22.481 --> 21:25.616
(laughs) ohhh!
I hope we win money.
