WEBVTT

00:11.960 --> 00:14.600
Why the hell is girl
not wearing any clothes?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.280
I apologize for that.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.840
Glad to see you again, Miss Tokyo.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.880
This time we'll be pragmatic.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.520
I ask and you answer.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.880
Who is the Professor?

00:37.680 --> 00:39.320
Are you the one who hits cops?

00:40.760 --> 00:43.480
MONDAY 7:30 PM

00:43.760 --> 00:45.440
I'll read you the penal code.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.160
Section 550.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.360
Assault on a police officer.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.760
HOUR 81 OF THE HEIST

00:52.920 --> 00:55.960
Punishable with one to four years
in prison.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.120
And we'll try hard
to give you all four years.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.440
Could I please speak to my lawyer?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.600
Sure. Speak all you want.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.000
You'll need to.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.320
But I need my phone.
That's where I have his number.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.720
They confiscated it with
the rest of my belongings.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.520
Wait there. Don't move.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.160
I feel sorry for the girl.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.840
Because between the asshole cops

01:22.760 --> 01:25.200
and these guys, I prefer the kidnappers.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.840
They've really done a number.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.800
We'll see how it ends.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.400
I know how it ends.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.280
With all the kidnappers gunned down.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.640
Okay, that's it for today's class.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.520
I'm starving.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.760
Rio.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.120
Remember I told you that we had
some things to set up?

03:02.680 --> 03:03.640
Yes.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.600
Well, the time has come.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.480
Damn.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.600
Some bachelor's pad you've got here,
Professor.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.920
Is this where you bring the chicks?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.360
Let's get to work. We have a lot to do.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.120
Shit, Professor. Who made this mess?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.000
Well...

03:51.080 --> 03:52.040
a company.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.880
Bullshit.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.800
This looks very amateur.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.280
Okay, I did it myself
with tutorials from the internet.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.600
Some crappy tutorials, am I right?

04:02.520 --> 04:04.120
That's why you're here, right?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.360
Well, that's it.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.920
The voice modifying software is installed.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.160
To talk to the police you simply...

04:39.800 --> 04:40.680
press MS.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.240
To contact the museum,

04:42.320 --> 04:43.560
zero. And that's it.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.520
The program changes your voice
when you contact someone.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.000
-Can I test it?
-Yes.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.400
You're speaking with the heist man.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.800
Can you select a male one?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.240
Okay, sorry.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.680
Son of a bitch. Bastard. Faggot.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.800
Okay, shit, fine.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.880
That's it.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.400
Try it now.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.720
You're speaking with
the leader of the heist.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.880
Good, that will do.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.160
Now we have to go on the black market web.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.360
-To buy some illegal goods.
-On the deep web.

05:38.040 --> 05:38.960
The deep internet.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.920
What it is that we're doing now?

05:54.280 --> 05:57.680
I disabled the firewalls and the Wi-Fi
and we're entering via Ethernet.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.680
I'm also diverting all data traffic
with a VPN via the TOR browser.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.520
Okay, well...

06:05.280 --> 06:06.240
continue.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
Done.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.520
They've got it all.
Rifles, grenades, rocket launchers.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.920
It's like an outlet store
for USSR weapons.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.720
Look, a tank.
We could enter with a tank.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.640
Like the A-team. With C-4...

06:33.720 --> 06:36.120
-Do you know what a Browning is?
-Yes, of course.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.720
We're going to buy a Browning machine gun.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.480
Assault rifles, handguns and ammo.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.720
Oh man, a V750 SAM missile!
That's a beast!

06:43.800 --> 06:45.720
Imagine entering the factory with that.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.280
You open the doors and boom!

06:47.360 --> 06:50.800
A V750 SAM missile pointed
straight at the cops.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.120
Boom! You blow them to bits.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.000
How cool would that be?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.960
Besides, it's cheap.
60 Bitcoins.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.480
That's like 150,000 euros, give or take.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.920
Cheap.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.480
Why did you take Rio off the plan?

07:21.560 --> 07:22.640
Tell me.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.280
I don't owe you any explanations, but...

07:28.280 --> 07:29.640
I don't think he is ready.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.120
You're wrong.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.320
Are you sure?
You've been months working with him.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.000
You know him and you know
how deeply immature he is.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.000
He doesn't realize what we'll do.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.400
Out there the bullets are real,
no extra lives

07:46.480 --> 07:48.840
-like in video games.
-Rio knows what he's doing.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.360
It's my responsibility

07:50.440 --> 07:52.080
and I will not involve a child.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.480
I'll pay him for his time, but he's out.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.080
He's the best at what he does,
you know it!

07:59.000 --> 08:00.360
That's why you chose him.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.240
He's a fucking wiz!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.600
So what if he's a weird genius!

08:06.480 --> 08:08.120
Are you an example of maturity?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.280
Are you?

08:10.840 --> 08:12.320
Are you normal?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.880
Is it normal
to arrange your shirts by color?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.720
Look at you, who buys your clothes?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.160
Your great-aunt Gertrude?

08:26.280 --> 08:27.200
And this?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.080
-What's this?
-Origami.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.680
It's an ancient art, don't...

08:34.760 --> 08:36.000
What's the matter?

08:36.680 --> 08:39.000
Are you afraid I'll break
your paper dolls?

08:40.280 --> 08:44.240
Welcome to Jurassic park!
Help, the dinosaur is eating me!

08:57.880 --> 08:58.960
What's the difference

08:59.760 --> 09:02.240
between this and playing video games?

09:13.960 --> 09:16.600
It's not your decision to make.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.840
Yes, it is.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.720
If Rio is out, I'm out.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.720
Because I'm not mature enough either.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.080
Well...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.520
Maybe we are all
immature to some extent...

09:43.000 --> 09:46.720
-and that makes us all a little...
-Special.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.360
Different.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
Maybe that isn't an obstacle.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.520
Maybe it's a virtue.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.800
Maybe.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.440
I'm sure it is.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.120
But don't tell me.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Tell him. He's behind the door.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.440
Thanks, Professor.
I promise you won't regret it.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.200
Thank you.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.720
RECENT CALLS

10:56.480 --> 10:58.640
-Hello?
-I need to speak with Inspector

10:58.720 --> 11:00.200
Raquel Murillo. It's urgent.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.360
Who's calling?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.520
It's a private matter.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.160
Inspector Murillo. Emergency call.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.320
Take it.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.920
I won't move.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.400
Private matter.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.560
-Who is it?
-Raquel. Thank God. It's...

11:23.000 --> 11:23.840
It's Salva,

11:23.920 --> 11:26.560
I'm calling from the police station.
I'm arrested.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.440
I'm accused of assaulting

11:28.520 --> 11:30.800
an on-duty agent.
Your ex-husband, specifically.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.880
What?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.360
I'm handcuffed
and they're talking about

11:34.440 --> 11:36.160
a four-year sentence.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.640
Wait...
What police station are you at?

11:38.720 --> 11:39.880
I'm in Canillas.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.520
Don't worry.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

11:43.600 --> 11:44.520
Thank you.

11:55.760 --> 11:56.720
Let's continue.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.640
You were about to tell me
about the Professor.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.800
You'd look prettier with short hair.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.600
Your cut makes you look like a mom.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.600
I feel like chopping it all right off.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
Perfect.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.120
Because I'm here,
just waiting for you to do it.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.120
Look on the bright side.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.640
You don't have to live on the run anymore.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.240
Now, you get a fresh start.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.320
You want to know how it all started?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.320
The Professor picked me up...

12:32.640 --> 12:33.960
in a red SEAT Ibiza.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.840
While the police were
setting me an ambush.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
No.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.360
No, it was before.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.840
A boy.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.280
His name was Miguel.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.280
He pulled my panties down
in front of the class.

12:59.840 --> 13:04.040
Can you believe they kicked me out
instead of that six-year-old prick?

13:06.320 --> 13:08.240
That's when it all started going wrong.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.520
Is it true, what they said?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.200
That you beat up a cop?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.920
You have to say it was a fight.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.080
If it was just you who hit him...

13:48.800 --> 13:50.320
consider yourself fucked.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.480
Because you look fine, honestly.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.040
Excuse me, can I use the bathroom?

14:20.880 --> 14:21.840
Watch him.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.800
I didn't sign up to be anyone's nurse.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.840
Nor to put up with speeches
or fucking therapy sessions.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.520
I didn't say anything earlier

14:33.600 --> 14:36.040
to avoid fucking up the group even more.

14:36.120 --> 14:36.960
How nice of you,

14:38.840 --> 14:40.400
to worry about the group.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.480
You know what I'm worried about?
The Professor, Berlin.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.800
He's not around.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.480
Just you.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.520
And he's the head of all this.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.680
And that's why
he mapped out a perfect plan.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.320
The plan we'll follow.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.120
Step by step, without straying from it!

14:57.200 --> 14:59.040
You already have strayed from it!

14:59.120 --> 15:00.360
You turned Tokyo in.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.840
Tokyo will get her share if she behaves
and stays quiet.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.480
Bullshit!

15:06.560 --> 15:08.240
If she was arrested,

15:08.320 --> 15:11.960
not rolled down the stairs
to the lions, like a dog!

15:12.040 --> 15:15.320
And because she's pissed off,
she's probably talking.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.640
And the GEO are probably in the hangar,

15:17.720 --> 15:19.720
digging another tunnel to get in here.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.080
I'll add it to the suggestions box.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.200
But, unfortunately, as you saw with Rio,

15:25.480 --> 15:29.520
it will be useless.
Because this is a patriarchy!

15:35.960 --> 15:38.720
-What does that mean?
-That I'm in charge!

15:43.200 --> 15:45.840
And if you don't want to end up
like Rio and Tokyo,

15:45.920 --> 15:47.880
I suggest you take a chill pill.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.480
What's the matter, Nairobi?

15:52.640 --> 15:54.960
Did you and Tokyo sync your periods?

16:08.440 --> 16:09.640
You and I are alike.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.160
I don't think my life
is as exciting as yours.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.480
No, I don't either.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.600
It must be difficult being a woman
in the police force.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.320
It is also difficult among heist men.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.640
We're very few.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.960
That's why we have to fight
and speak up all the time.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.720
Right?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.120
Isn't it exhausting?

16:41.440 --> 16:42.400
Silene.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.520
You're trying to waste my time.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.520
And you're ruining your chances
of a reduced sentence.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.400
Every minute you waste costs you a year.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.880
Look, now you're young and pretty.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.480
You have a good body.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.200
In 12 years you'll still look good.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.800
With some interesting little wrinkles.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.680
But if you get out of jail in 24 years...

17:11.280 --> 17:13.440
You will have gone into menopause.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.680
And that...

17:15.280 --> 17:17.480
must be pretty shitty.
Right, Prieto?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.280
I know from his mother.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.680
And I'm not talking about the hot flashes.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.360
I'm talking about feeling

17:29.160 --> 17:30.960
like you lost something important.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.720
Something deeply yours,

17:34.640 --> 17:36.200
vanished forever.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.720
Your life.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.400
Inspector.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.200
Do you really picture me in a garden
raising a family?

17:49.040 --> 17:50.320
Changing diapers?

17:51.640 --> 17:52.760
Please!

17:54.640 --> 17:55.520
Look.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.040
I'm giving you one last chance
before I call the pre-trial judge.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.960
If you don't talk, it's goodbye.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.000
You go to pre-trial detention.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.000
Losing all extenuating circumstances.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.640
In other words,
ten to twelve years of your life.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.640
So think about it before you
throw it all away.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.120
Do you want some advice?

18:20.960 --> 18:21.800
Sure.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.880
Think of a nice place.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.800
Of a time in your life
when you were really happy.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.880
Take a deep breath.

18:33.040 --> 18:33.920
Reflect.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.720
Tokyo!

18:55.680 --> 18:56.720
I can't.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.520
Of course you can't.
You're all drugged up.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.080
It's a hypnotic sedative.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.200
Relax and enjoy.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
Water.

19:16.120 --> 19:16.960
Please.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.520
Go back to sleep.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.240
How am I supposed to sleep?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.320
I can't stop dreaming about Tokyo.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.560
Tokyo is a fucking bitch.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.400
What?

19:37.560 --> 19:40.520
Do you know what she did
with my only hope?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.120
When did you last see him?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.480
How old was he? Three?

19:43.720 --> 19:47.240
She chewed it up, and spat it in my face.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.240
-He won't remember you.
-Shut the fuck up.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.560
-He won't remember, or recognize you.
-Shut up.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.320
You know what's the worst part?

20:01.240 --> 20:02.400
That she's right.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.760
She's right.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.760
I was going to kidnap a child

20:11.000 --> 20:12.960
who doesn't even know who I am.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.360
I was going to kidnap a child

20:19.160 --> 20:20.520
who doesn't know who I am.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.720
Now I don't even know
what to do with the money.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.200
I mean,

20:35.560 --> 20:36.720
maybe not now.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.320
But in a few years, you go find him and...

20:41.640 --> 20:43.040
and you explain it to him.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.520
You say, "Shit. Look, I'm your mother.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.680
I live in Jamaica and I'm loaded.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.560
and if you want to hear the rest
I'll buy you a plane to come see me".

20:58.480 --> 20:59.800
Besides, you're young.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.200
You have ovaries don't you?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.320
You can have another one.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.480
You're right.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.920
Five minutes, not one more.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.080
It sounds so easy.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.200
Hey.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.960
Would you give me a child?
Would you do that for me?

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
Of course.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.960
How do you want it, blond or brunette?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.200
I'm not joking.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.000
If I get out of here,
I'm going to need a reason to live.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.400
Look, Nairobi, what can I say?

22:53.520 --> 22:55.960
Having a baby to have a reason to live

22:56.480 --> 22:58.200
doesn't sound like a good plan.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.360
No?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.320
Besides, I'm with Tokyo, you know...

23:01.400 --> 23:03.520
Hey, I'm not asking you to marry me.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.160
I'm just asking for a little sperm.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.240
Two thrusts and that's it, pregnant.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.280
You're so handsome. And you're smart.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.240
And that cute little smile.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.040
This is how easy it is. Don't move!

23:19.520 --> 23:20.720
It's that easy!

23:21.000 --> 23:23.600
Trading one child for another,
what's the difference?

23:23.680 --> 23:24.520
In the end

23:24.600 --> 23:27.560
all that matters is having
a reason to live!

23:27.640 --> 23:28.600
Fuck!

23:28.720 --> 23:30.400
And you say Tokyo is crazy.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.360
You're worse.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.000
-Where are you going?
-To hell!

23:35.080 --> 23:35.960
No. Don't move!

23:37.000 --> 23:37.960
No.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.400
We have to fuck over Berlin
without turning ourselves in.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.120
Salva.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.120
I'm really sorry, honestly.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.040
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.720
-What did that animal do?
-No.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.960
It wasn't entirely his fault, I...

24:12.640 --> 24:14.600
I talked about what he did to you.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.960
The abuse,
the thing with your sister and...

24:17.240 --> 24:19.920
-Shit.
-I'm really sorry. It's not like me,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.880
I don't know what came over me.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.560
I got so angry.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.360
I swear, I'm not violent.
I have never hit anyone.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.280
Ever.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.480
I prefer to calmly talk things through...

24:30.560 --> 24:31.640
Self defense?

24:34.680 --> 24:37.560
Well, I'm no Mohammad Ali, but...

24:39.120 --> 24:40.560
I have my pride.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.880
And I gave him his share.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.840
But my body feels like a punching bag.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.200
-I think he won.
-Let me see.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.320
Wait.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.160
Jesus!

25:01.880 --> 25:04.200
I'm calling a doctor right now.
Don't worry.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.720
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.880
I tell you I have a boyfriend and you
find the time to beat him up?

25:16.800 --> 25:18.960
He hit me! I didn't even touch him!

25:20.000 --> 25:21.880
Withdraw the complaint now.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.640
Remove the one you filed against me.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.320
This will help you a lot
in the trial we have pending.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.640
I mean the fact that you
also beat him up.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.480
He left me unconscious!
He's Chuck Norris with glasses!

25:33.560 --> 25:35.480
Save the nonsense for your lawyer!

25:35.720 --> 25:38.320
-This won't help you with custody!
-Raquel...

25:38.560 --> 25:39.600
I didn't do anything.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.400
-I didn't touch him.
-Really?

25:41.840 --> 25:42.680
Come with me.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.480
I'm Inspector Raquel Murillo
from headquarters.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.640
I want to know who took
this man's statement.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.880
And why you haven't called a doctor,

25:53.960 --> 25:55.800
since he's been beaten by this agent.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.360
Salva.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.240
Open your shirt.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.360
He would like to file a complaint
for abuse of authority.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.960
File a report of the injuries.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.720
You're all witnesses in court.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.600
I don't know how he got those bruises,

26:31.680 --> 26:33.120
I swear I didn't touch him.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.920
The victim has bruises
on his chest, ribs and abdomen.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.680
Clear signs of a beating.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.160
Is someone writing down
the statement?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.240
Raquel!

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
Okay.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.880
Drop it. I'll withdraw the complaint.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.200
Very well. Then he'll withdraw his.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.960
Remove his handcuffs!

26:59.240 --> 27:00.800
Where are his belongings?

27:01.480 --> 27:04.040
I am not one of these
conspiracy theorists,

27:04.120 --> 27:07.160
but having my prints and
personal information out there is...

27:07.960 --> 27:08.880
Yeah.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.320
Where's the report you filed
on his arrest?

27:34.400 --> 27:35.800
Let's go, Salva.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.600
I had never felt so lost.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.320
I had nothing left.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.880
I had to decide
whether to rat out my team...

28:03.080 --> 28:05.520
and try for a plea bargain with the judge.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.720
Want to say something?

28:24.640 --> 28:27.240
Could someone please make me
some fried eggs?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.720
Fuck.
I've been eating garbage for four days.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.560
Tokyo, I won't fail you.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.200
I have it all figured out.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.080
Besides, I'm a lucky man.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.360
Always remember that.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.920
Tokyo, I won't fail you.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.560
I can't do this anymore.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.320
I've done 30 boxes like this one.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.800
They don't care
that I have a gunshot wound.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.800
Not to mention the scars
we'll have after this,

29:06.880 --> 29:08.480
especially the psychological ones.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.560
Having to come to work every day

29:12.840 --> 29:14.200
and reliving it all.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.480
It's going to be hard on all of us.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.600
Some of us might even suffer
from post-traumatic stress.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.480
I'll be the lucky winner.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.880
I don't know what could be worse

29:25.960 --> 29:27.320
than losing everything.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.840
I've lost everything.
And money won't make up for it.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.560
Not by far.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.720
Regarding the one million euros...

29:37.080 --> 29:38.000
How funny.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.280
Trusting them
while they locked us up like livestock.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.600
Will you shut up?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.800
-Excuse me?
-Shut the fuck up.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.880
Alison, please.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.440
I'm tired

29:52.720 --> 29:54.240
of listening to him whining.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.840
If it's so bad, do something.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.800
I also used to complain.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
About my parents,

30:07.400 --> 30:09.240
or the school where I was bullied.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.720
I kept putting up with it.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.120
-Enough is enough.
-Well, honey,

30:15.200 --> 30:17.240
it's normal to feel hopeless.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.480
Quite the opposite.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.640
It may have fucked up your lives.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.360
But it has opened my eyes.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.920
I realized that we are what we eat.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.480
And I'm not eating anymore crap.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.040
So I'm leaving.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.840
Alison, don't be foolish.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.800
I'm your guardian and
I'm responsible for your safety.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.280
-So, while I'm here...
-You're here for the money.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.240
You might be okay
picking crumbs off the table

30:43.560 --> 30:46.520
and being accomplices to these scumbags,
but I'm not.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.080
Besides,
it's not that hard to get out of here.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.760
Get out of here?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.080
How?

30:58.800 --> 31:00.040
I'll hurt myself.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.560
They'll take me somewhere else.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.680
And I'll escape.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.320
No, no and no.
Don't you dare do that nonsense.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.040
Mercedes...

31:10.760 --> 31:11.600
Let her explain.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.600
I've seen it more than ten times
since we've been here.

31:17.720 --> 31:21.040
They press the button and the door
takes only four seconds to open.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.120
Four seconds and you run.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.960
That's all it takes.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.320
That's more than enough time
for them to gun you down.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.800
We'll see about that.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.200
What's up, hostages?

32:06.280 --> 32:09.120
Do you sleep well thinking
about your million?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.200
Well, keep dreaming.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.160
Nobody's going to give it to you!

32:14.800 --> 32:16.040
It's a lie!

32:16.560 --> 32:19.560
Just like no one has released
your colleagues,

32:19.640 --> 32:22.160
the ones who chose to leave
instead of the million! No!

32:22.360 --> 32:24.560
They're locked up two stories below you!

32:24.640 --> 32:25.880
That stupid idiot.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.640
Chained to a pipe!

32:28.200 --> 32:29.080
It was a ploy!

32:29.880 --> 32:33.920
To keep you calm, like sheep!
Working for us but

32:34.440 --> 32:38.520
wearing a smile. Because here
you always have to wear a smile!

32:39.000 --> 32:41.520
Am I right, Mr. Andres de Fonollosa?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.800
We don't want any long faces, do we?

32:45.840 --> 32:46.680
Are you done?

32:47.000 --> 32:50.280
We're not going
through the hole you're digging, no!

32:50.680 --> 32:53.680
We're going through one
that leads into the vault!

33:01.320 --> 33:02.440
That's high treason.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.120
Unforgivable.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.280
Let's go.

33:22.680 --> 33:23.520
Any news?

33:24.160 --> 33:25.640
She hasn't said a thing.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.520
Miss Tokyo has no interest in cooperating.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.360
Coronel.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.320
Let me ask you.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.040
Did agent Rubio mention anything
about a teaspoon?

33:39.520 --> 33:40.400
A teaspoon?

33:40.800 --> 33:41.680
No. Why?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.440
Angel sent it to the lab
before the accident.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.000
The fingerprints match those of the guy

33:47.080 --> 33:49.760
who broke into the patrol vehicle
to threaten the Russian.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.600
It's the person helping them
from the outside.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.760
-And who the hell is it?
-I don't know.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.960
Seems to be the same one
who tampered with Angel's car

33:58.040 --> 34:00.680
to cause the accident.
But only Angel knows that.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.240
And her.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.160
Tell me one thing.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.960
Are you keeping quiet for all of them

34:22.800 --> 34:24.520
or only for Anibal Cortes?

34:26.800 --> 34:27.760
You seem

34:28.080 --> 34:29.960
very much in love in these pictures.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.800
How about I offer you
a two-for-one special?

34:39.400 --> 34:40.480
Like a happy hour.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.760
I'll offer him
the same deal I offered you.

34:43.720 --> 34:45.880
Mitigation, remorse and cooperation.

34:47.240 --> 34:50.680
As long as the information
you give helps us to put an end

34:50.800 --> 34:51.920
to this nightmare.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.080
We're talking about a third
of the sentence.

34:55.800 --> 34:56.880
That's impossible.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.960
We have enough crimes
to do several lifetimes in prison.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.640
No judge can promise that.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Let alone you.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.480
I don't know what you've heard.
But if you show remorse,

35:09.720 --> 35:12.920
cooperate and help save 50 lives...

35:13.280 --> 35:15.840
I assure you that any judge
will be benevolent.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.160
Anibal Cortes has no record
of violent crimes.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.960
-He would be out in five years.
-24 years old.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.880
Like he's just graduated.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.800
I think it's a better plan than ending up
like your last boyfriend.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.520
Don't you think?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.760
It was a bad idea
to talk to the hostages, Rio.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.600
You better turn me in like Tokyo,

35:45.800 --> 35:48.360
tied up nice and good.
Because I'm not staying quiet.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.480
I trust Tokyo.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.680
But you're a snotty little child.

35:53.960 --> 35:54.840
It's a shame.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.600
What a paradox, Helsinki.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.680
Tokyo

35:59.400 --> 36:01.480
will stay quiet to protect him.

36:03.800 --> 36:07.160
And yet you're going to disappear
without her knowing.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.520
What are you going to do?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.320
What you've been screaming for.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.600
I'll execute you.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.880
You have, indeed, lost your mind.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.840
I can't let you leave,

36:22.880 --> 36:24.560
nor can I let you stay.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.160
What you told the hostages
has sentenced you,

36:28.240 --> 36:29.840
so I won't flinch.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.840
Okay, maybe a little.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.880
That's it.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.560
It's important to face death with humor.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.000
It's not that those of us who do
reckless things

37:00.320 --> 37:02.320
don't care about the consequences.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.560
No.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.800
We care as much as anyone else.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.720
Butwe can't see them
until it's too late.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.160
We only see them when they're
right in front of us.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.120
Last words?

37:20.160 --> 37:21.960
You can still learn from your mistakes

37:22.040 --> 37:23.360
and stop being an ass.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.360
Look at this, Helsinki!

37:25.880 --> 37:27.920
This boy has just wizened up!

37:28.720 --> 37:32.520
If you had lived longer you
could have been Paulo Coelho's successor.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.120
Too bad.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.960
The world is going to miss out.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.440
Berlin!

37:39.240 --> 37:41.920
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Put the gun down!

37:42.000 --> 37:43.920
The time for allegations is over!

37:44.040 --> 37:46.680
Democracy has only brought trouble.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.280
And I've just sentenced him.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.600
Enough crap, we're all on edge!

37:51.800 --> 37:53.560
Berlin, let's not screw it up more.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.800
Berlin, we can't screw each other over.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.880
Go down there.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.480
Berlin.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.600
You had better lower the gun,

38:42.680 --> 38:44.800
because if you don't you'll be in pain.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.000
I found your painkillers.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.960
What will you do, Nairobi?

38:58.040 --> 39:00.000
Break them one by one, like Tokyo did?

39:00.080 --> 39:02.640
Well, since I'm on my period,
maybe I will.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.240
Us women are so nosy, right?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.960
And we have such a bad temper
when rubbed the wrong way.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.520
Son of a bitch!

39:39.000 --> 39:41.240
Berlin, you have a missed call, dear.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.840
It's okay, man, it's okay.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.680
All right. You've chosen.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.880
Poorly, but you've chosen.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.080
Take her away.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.760
And with that clarity I saw myself,

39:57.000 --> 39:57.960
at the trial,

39:58.120 --> 39:59.160
in prison,

39:59.440 --> 40:01.360
and I knew the inspector was right.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.360
It wasn't worth sacrificing myself
for a plan that had already failed.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.360
The Professor's plan.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.120
And even more so since I thought
he had deceived me.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.080
Sergio!

40:13.800 --> 40:15.040
His name is Sergio.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.160
Wait!

40:17.480 --> 40:18.320
Let her talk.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.520
The Professor is Sergio Marquina.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.480
And the heist was his father's idea.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.960
And who is the person on the outside?

40:33.960 --> 40:34.840
Inspector.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.520
They're calling from inside the factory.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.640
Inspector, how are you?
How's your day going?

40:48.000 --> 40:49.160
I think it's going well.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.360
I was a little worried about you.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.400
I thought we weren't going to speak again

40:55.480 --> 40:58.120
That something terrible
had happened to you.

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
Sergio.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.680
I thank you for the concern, inspector.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.840
But...

41:09.560 --> 41:11.680
I'm a lucky man. Never forget that.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.400
I just called to say hello.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.240
Continue interrogating Tokyo
She has a lot to tell you.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.800
When you finish

41:20.600 --> 41:21.560
give me a call.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.720
I'll be right here.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.960
What do you have to tell me?

41:39.120 --> 41:41.600
They kicked me out to give you
a message.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.440
We have a hydrogen bomb in there.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.720
Seventeen megatons

41:47.520 --> 41:49.680
We're setting it off tomorrow,
at 12:00 PM.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.640
I'd like to speak to a priest.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.240
I need to confess.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.280
Very well.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.160
We'll request
unconditional isolated detention.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.160
Gomez.

42:03.640 --> 42:04.520
Write the report

42:04.600 --> 42:07.520
and emphasize on her lack
of cooperation and remorse.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.480
Send her to the nearest prison.
Lobo, take her.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.720
Check-up call.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.440
-Everything is running smoothly over here.
-Smoothly?

42:31.800 --> 42:34.400
Smoothly as in Tokyo being interrogated?

42:35.400 --> 42:38.200
As in you're about to execute Rio?

42:38.680 --> 42:40.160
Berlin, what are you doing?

42:45.760 --> 42:47.320
Professor, it's Nairobi.

42:47.880 --> 42:52.120
Berlin is indisposed.
So from now on, I'm in charge.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.760
Let the matriarchy begin.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.320
