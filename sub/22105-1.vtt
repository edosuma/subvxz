<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.280 --> 00:05.250
<i>and I graduated from one of Canada's
top business schools</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.250
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.760 --> 00:11.310
<i>Now, I'm using my knowledge

This is <i>Nathan for You</i>.

00:25.930 --> 00:27.960
<i>Greg Boodaghian works in an industry</i>

00:27.960 --> 00:29.920
<i>where dishonesty runs rampant.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.800
<i>And that makes the fact that I first
thought his business was called</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:35.540
<i>"Gay Auto Repair"
the least of his worries.</i>

00:35.540 --> 00:38.470
<i>His biggest problem?
Customers not trusting him.</i>

00:38.470 --> 00:40.120
I do have clients like that, then.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.500
Once they enter here,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.570
they think that
I'm ready to rip them off.

00:43.890 --> 00:45.590
<i>Greg seemed like
an honest mechanic,</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:47.760
<i>but before helping him,
I needed to be sure.</i>

00:47.980 --> 00:50.650
<i>So I baked him some cookies
with salt instead of sugar</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:52.870
<i>to see if he'd be honest
about the taste,</i>

00:52.960 --> 00:55.200
<i>and the next day,
I paid him a visit at his shop</i>

00:55.250 --> 00:58.030
<i>in Glendale, California,
with my homemade treats.</i>

00:58.090 --> 01:00.150
I have a little
surprise for you.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.880
I baked you these cookies.

01:01.940 --> 01:02.940
- For me?
- Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.269
So feel free to have one.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.240
Sure.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.270
- Who made it? You made it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.160
What do you think?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.830
- Very good.
- You like it?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.930
I like it.
Yeah, a little salty. Different.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.020
<i>Good enough.</i>

01:20.100 --> 01:23.110
<i>The plan: for Greg to promote
that he's an honest mechanic</i>

01:23.290 --> 01:27.550
<i>by only giving estimates while
hooked up to a lie detector.</i>

01:28.010 --> 01:30.510
I never thought of that,
but, you know, it's--

01:30.550 --> 01:33.720
Something like this won't
only make you look more honest,

01:33.720 --> 01:36.340
But it will make your
competitors look more dishonest

01:36.340 --> 01:38.450
because it'll make
everyone in the city go,

01:39.060 --> 01:40.800
"Well, why isn't my mechanic
hooked up to a polygraph?

01:41.380 --> 01:43.230
I want to go to the guy who is."

01:43.280 --> 01:45.440
Probably, yeah.
People will think that way.

01:45.490 --> 01:46.080
Yeah. Yeah.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.070
<i>Greg seemed into my idea,
and that meant I needed to find</i>

01:49.070 --> 01:51.470
<i>a reliable polygraph machine
for him to use.</i>

01:51.470 --> 01:52.470
Do you want another one?

01:52.870 --> 01:54.880
- Oh, I'll take it later.
- Have another one now.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.160
No?
- No.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.820
<i>So I tracked down
a local polygraph operator</i>

01:58.840 --> 02:01.720
<i>and met up with him at my office
to put his machine to the test.</i>

02:02.390 --> 02:04.980
Answer the following questions
truthfully, okay?

02:05.020 --> 02:06.230
Mm-hmm.

02:06.270 --> 02:09.780
- Is today Thursday?
- Yes.

02:09.820 --> 02:12.110
Are you currently
sitting down?

02:12.150 --> 02:14.027
Yes.

02:14.253 --> 02:16.833
Have you ever used pornography
to pleasure yourself?

02:18.423 --> 02:20.119
Is that a standard question?

02:20.213 --> 02:22.250
Try to not talk
between questions.

02:22.290 --> 02:24.330
Have you ever used
online pornography

02:24.370 --> 02:26.920
or pornography
to pleasure yourself?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.590
No.

02:28.630 --> 02:29.590
Okay.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.510
Deceptive.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.300
Well,
I don't know about that 100%.

02:34.384 --> 02:36.996
<i>I don't look at pornography,
so it was obvious</i>

02:37.063 --> 02:40.560
<i>that Gene's old machine was
too inaccurate to use with Greg.</i>

02:40.600 --> 02:42.771
<i>So I sought out
a different polygraph operator</i>

02:42.861 --> 02:45.100
<i>who claimed to have
the most up-to-date equipment.</i>

02:45.150 --> 02:47.650
Honestly,
this machine looked like

02:47.690 --> 02:50.400
something out of the 1500s.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.400
- It was like...
- Yeah,

02:51.440 --> 02:54.070
- those are only 80% accurate.
- Right.

02:54.110 --> 02:56.950
So what I want to do today,
along with testing your machine,

02:57.030 --> 03:01.700
is to show that I was telling
the truth in that situation

03:01.750 --> 03:04.920
and that I don't watch
online pornography.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.630
Okay.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.290
<i>And once I was all hooked up,</i>

03:08.340 --> 03:10.420
<i>I was ready to
take on the hard questions.</i>

03:10.460 --> 03:12.550
Do you live in Wisconsin?

03:12.590 --> 03:15.340
- No.
- Pass.

03:15.380 --> 03:19.140
Do you ever look
at pornography on the internet?

03:24.140 --> 03:25.600
No.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.314
Fail.

03:27.381 --> 03:28.645
I--I s--

03:28.698 --> 03:30.198
Have you ever
pleasured yourself

03:30.234 --> 03:31.984
while watching pornography
on the internet?

03:32.051 --> 03:33.101
No.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.110
Fail.

03:35.150 --> 03:36.740
Do you need to reboot
the computer or something?

03:36.820 --> 03:38.570
There's no-- nothing to reboot.

03:38.570 --> 03:39.740
It's rolling.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.580
'cause I noticed
your computer is a Dell.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.910
- So I don't know...
- Computer's a Toshiba.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.620
- It never glitches?
- No.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.420
You're failing, I and I think
it's 'cause you're lying.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.380
- But it's weird for me a little
bit when I'm telling the truth

03:49.420 --> 03:51.750
and the computer
is saying I'm lying.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.827
and on top of that,
it's a Toshiba.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.680
Small green mountain,
small green mountain,

03:57.720 --> 03:59.300
giant green mountain.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.010
- What was that question for?
- Porn.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.470
Do you ever watch porn
on the internet?

04:02.510 --> 04:04.520
Is that a Windows 95?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.229
Oh, Jesus, dude.
You're graspin' at straws.

04:07.524 --> 04:09.194
The operating system
has nothing to do

04:09.279 --> 04:11.869
with what you're shooting out.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.780
And it's not Windows 95.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.449
- XP?
- Yes.

04:15.743 --> 04:19.243
Still, it's not the most recent
operating system, I don't think.

04:19.517 --> 04:22.322
<i>Despite the inaccuracy
of John's dated machine,</i>

04:22.480 --> 04:24.632
<i>we had to go with him
since there weren't</i>

04:24.702 --> 04:25.959
<i>any other operators
in the area.</i>

04:26.133 --> 04:27.787
- See you later.
- Bye.

04:29.181 --> 04:33.411
<i>Back at G&Y, I had
a surprise in store for Greg.</i>

04:33.460 --> 04:35.630
- I got you that sign.
- All right, that's cool.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.050
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:37.130 --> 04:39.180
<i>With the sign in place,
it was finally time for Greg</i>

04:39.220 --> 04:41.760
<i>to try out his new honest
approach with customers.</i>

04:41.800 --> 04:43.430
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey. Hi.

04:43.470 --> 04:46.270
- We have a special today.
- Okay.

04:46.310 --> 04:49.560
We accept a polygraph test
when we give you...

04:49.600 --> 04:50.560
Oh, wow.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.440
When we give you
the estimates.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.860
So if you want a--
you're willing to--

04:53.900 --> 04:56.320
That sounds great.
Yeah.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.320
<i>Customers seemed excited
about the promotion,</i>

04:58.320 --> 05:01.700
<i>and after a thorough inspection,
Greg gave his quote.</i>

05:01.740 --> 05:03.830
The rear, you have,
like, 5% left.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.120
Okay.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.160
<i>While John, our polygraph
examiner, took notes.</i>

05:08.210 --> 05:10.960
Now it was time to put
Greg's honesty to the test.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.960
- Is today Sunday?
- No.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.210
True.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.340
Do the rear brake pads
only have 5% left?

05:18.340 --> 05:22.140
- Yes.
- True.

05:22.180 --> 05:25.760
Is $180 a fair price
to replace an ABS sensor?

05:25.810 --> 05:28.020
- Yes.
- True.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.430
Okay.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.440
So based on those answers, how
do you feel about your estimate?

05:34.480 --> 05:38.030
Yeah, it's--
he sounds truthful.

05:38.030 --> 05:40.110
Keep in mind, too,
that yesterday

05:40.150 --> 05:42.990
when he did a test on me,
it said that I, you know,

05:43.030 --> 05:45.404
pleasured myself to pornography,
and I don't do that.

05:45.489 --> 05:47.135
So--
just keep in mind...

05:47.296 --> 05:48.450
Oh, really?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.169
- It's not fully accurate 100%.
- Okay.

05:50.258 --> 05:53.768
It's like, you know, run on
a Toshiba laptop with XP, so--

05:53.880 --> 05:55.590
it's 98% accurate,

05:55.630 --> 05:57.829
and he has pleasured himself
to porn on the internet.

05:57.943 --> 06:00.403
No, that's-- we had--
we determined yesterday

06:00.453 --> 06:02.993
that that was possibly
a glitch with the machine, or--

06:03.033 --> 06:05.033
No, I disputed
that right away.

06:05.350 --> 06:07.890
There is absolutely no way
you were telling the truth

06:07.890 --> 06:09.434
on the two questions you failed.

06:09.552 --> 06:10.922
Okay.

06:10.939 --> 06:12.949
I'm just trying to establish
there is some uncertainty,

06:12.989 --> 06:14.029
and, you know, to--

06:14.074 --> 06:15.364
There's absolutely
no uncertainty.

06:15.449 --> 06:17.579
Your body exploded on those
two questions across--

06:17.596 --> 06:19.896
But we don't know 100%
that my body exploded.

06:19.936 --> 06:21.316
It is the computer
that's showing...

06:21.356 --> 06:22.766
Oh, it was 100% your body.

06:22.766 --> 06:25.436
You keep trying to blame it
on Windows this and programs.

06:25.503 --> 06:27.513
It was your body.
You failed.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.950
There is no doubt you have
watched porn on the Internet

06:30.000 --> 06:31.580
at some time in your life,
and there is zero doubt--

06:31.580 --> 06:32.750
Well, maybe he just--

06:32.790 --> 06:34.420
Maybe he was uncomfortable
with the question.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.710
- No.
- No?

06:35.750 --> 06:38.750
I was uncomfortable
with the question, though.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.969
So thank you.

06:40.055 --> 06:42.515
<i>Despite the accuracy problems
with John's machine,</i>

06:42.689 --> 06:44.756
<i>more and more customers
seemed to enjoy</i>

06:44.840 --> 06:46.720
<i>their polygraph-verified quotes.</i>

06:46.760 --> 06:51.020
Did you find a loose vacuum hose
and you reattached it?

06:51.060 --> 06:52.350
Yes.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.690
True.

06:54.730 --> 06:57.440
So as you can see, the things
he quoted you in the estimate

06:57.480 --> 07:00.110
were exactly things that are
actually problems with your car,

07:00.110 --> 07:02.440
and you do need,
and you know that.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.179
But if you go anywhere else,
you won't know that.

07:04.245 --> 07:05.831
Right.

07:06.517 --> 07:08.796
Sounds like a winner.

07:09.571 --> 07:11.891
<i>I was so proud that
I could finally help Greg</i>

07:11.950 --> 07:14.830
<i>profit from his honesty,
and at the end of the day,</i>

07:14.870 --> 07:17.540
<i>I wanted to see what he thought
of the whole experience.</i>

07:17.580 --> 07:19.540
Were you happy
with everything that I did?

07:19.590 --> 07:21.760
We were happy, yes.
We were happy, so--

07:21.800 --> 07:23.010
Yeah.

07:23.050 --> 07:25.010
Do you mind if I ask you that

07:25.050 --> 07:26.550
while hooked up
to the polygraph?

07:26.590 --> 07:28.720
- Sure.
- Yeah?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.470
So were you happy with
everything I did for you today?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.230
Yes.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.810
True.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.257
One more question.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.711
Would you ever
want to hang out sometime

07:40.802 --> 07:42.512
socially with me
outside of this?

07:42.690 --> 07:44.169
No.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.194
True.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.600
Hmm.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.580
Okay.

07:56.620 --> 07:59.540
Well, thank you, and--yeah,
thank you for your honesty.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.420
Yeah.

08:01.460 --> 08:02.750
And, yeah.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.510
Best of luck with everything.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.680
Are we done? Yeah.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.840
Yay. Okay.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.510
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

08:09.550 --> 08:12.600
- Good to meet you.
- Bye.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.270
It's-- yeah. All right.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.739
<i>Sue Stanford is one
of over 6,000 licensed realtors</i>

08:21.817 --> 08:24.520
<i>in L.A. County,
and in an oversaturated market,</i>

08:24.560 --> 08:26.770
<i>it can be hard
to stand out from the crowd.</i>

08:26.850 --> 08:30.940
We're continually trying
to outdo the other--

08:30.940 --> 08:32.990
person, you know,
trying to get business.

<i>one of the most sought-after

08:38.010 --> 08:41.676
So I always like to begin
with some small talk

08:41.863 --> 08:44.790
to break the ice and make
the other person comfortable.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.210
Okay.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.633
Have you ever posed
for a painting before?

08:51.500 --> 08:55.300
No, not actually,
not for anything like that.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.300
You'd make a good model.
You're very beautiful.

08:57.390 --> 08:58.680
Well, bless your heart.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.890
You're welcome.

09:01.930 --> 09:05.020
So is that enough small talk

09:14.780 --> 09:17.570
<i>in a currently unrepresented
group of homebuyer,</i>

09:17.660 --> 09:20.950
<i>the 50% of people
who believe in ghosts.</i>

09:20.950 --> 09:22.683
Ghosts?

09:22.832 --> 09:25.450
When you show a house,
you know, half the people

09:25.450 --> 09:28.540
that come through are thinking,
"Is there a ghost in here?"

09:28.580 --> 09:30.130
Okay.

09:30.130 --> 09:32.096
So it surprised me that
I've never seen a realtor

09:32.132 --> 09:34.880
that can guarantee
that all the homes they sell

09:34.920 --> 09:36.590
are entirely ghost-free.

09:36.590 --> 09:38.970
True, yeah.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.260
So what I'm suggesting

09:40.340 --> 09:43.890
is a complete re-branding
of you as the Ghost Realtor.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.020
Huh.

09:47.060 --> 09:49.270
It's really a wild idea.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.360
<i>Sue wasn't fully
seeing my vision yet,</i>

09:51.400 --> 09:54.150
<i>So to help sell it to her,
I mocked up some new branding</i>

09:54.190 --> 09:56.610
<i>and prepared a special surprise
to get her excited.</i>

09:56.690 --> 09:58.490
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.280
All right, open your eyes.
Look.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.985
Oh, my gosh.

10:03.026 --> 10:05.200
That's amazing.

10:05.290 --> 10:06.410
Pretty great, huh?

10:06.450 --> 10:07.710
That's me.

10:07.750 --> 10:12.250
"My homes are 100% ghost-
and demon-free."

10:12.290 --> 10:13.648
Oh, my goodness.

10:13.689 --> 10:15.914
<i>I could tell Sue was thrilled
with her new image,</i>

10:16.170 --> 10:18.094
<i>but to fully rebrand
as the ghost realtor,</i>

10:18.158 --> 10:20.595
<i>she'd need to work with
a professional psychic medium</i>

10:20.651 --> 10:23.747
<i>Who could verify whether
her homes were truly ghost-free.</i>

10:23.794 --> 10:26.180
<i>So I found a local
psychic online...</i>

10:26.180 --> 10:28.850
<i>Hello.
I'm psychic Ron Bard.</i>

10:28.850 --> 10:31.650
<i>and arranged for he and Sue
to meet at one of her listings.</i>

10:31.690 --> 10:33.150
My mother was considered

10:33.190 --> 10:35.690
Queen of the Psychics
by Dr. Hans Holzer.

10:35.690 --> 10:38.110
He's written 145 books.

10:38.150 --> 10:39.950
Wow.

10:39.990 --> 10:43.870
And my daughter just found
her first missing child in New York.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.200
Okay.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.160
So just to be clear, if there's
a ghost in this house,

10:48.250 --> 10:49.460
you'll be able to tell.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.830
- That's correct.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.130
<i>With Ron's guarantee,
I introduced him to Sue.</i>

10:53.170 --> 10:54.630
My great pleasure.

10:54.670 --> 10:57.217
<i>And then we followed
as he led us through the house</i>

10:57.271 --> 11:00.170
<i>inspecting each room
for the presence of any ghosts.</i>

11:00.220 --> 11:02.260
Definitely a change of energy.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.350
- You feel that, correct?
- Mm-hmm, definitely.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.260
I feel, like, chills going down
my spine right now.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.890
- Right.
- Is it a ghost?

11:07.890 --> 11:09.230
No.

11:09.270 --> 11:11.270
<i>Things were off to
a great start, as Ron believed</i>

11:11.310 --> 11:13.454
<i>the first house
was completely ghost-free.</i>

11:13.573 --> 11:16.190
I'm not feeling there's
any entities in this house.

11:16.230 --> 11:17.988
- Well, that's good.
- That's good.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.420
- Yes.
- I can sell the house.

11:19.459 --> 11:20.431
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.715
<i>But when we visited
another one of Sue's listings,</i>

11:22.815 --> 11:24.558
<i>Ron felt a presence
immediately.</i>

11:24.616 --> 11:28.830
I'm hearing screaming and
arguing throughout the house.

11:28.870 --> 11:31.210
- Screaming and arguing?
- Yeah.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.750
This is no good.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.040
- Oh, dear.
- The bathroom?

11:34.130 --> 11:36.250
This whole house.
Something's wrong.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.920
Wow.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.380
<i>Ron sensed evil all around us.</i>

11:40.380 --> 11:42.550
Something went on back there.

11:42.590 --> 11:44.260
<i>But it wasn't until
we went into the bedroom</i>

11:44.260 --> 11:46.430
<i>that he felt
the true presence of the ghost.</i>

11:46.470 --> 11:48.600
You feel like there's
ghosts around, or--

11:48.600 --> 11:52.390
- Yeah.
- Ooh, is that right?

11:52.440 --> 11:53.890
I feel there are entities
in this house.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.560
- I see.
- There's no question about it.

11:56.610 --> 11:59.360
Well, that sucks for you.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.820
Yeah, yeah.

12:00.860 --> 12:03.700
What is his activity
in the house?

12:03.740 --> 12:05.070
It's, like, evil.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.490
It's like--you know
what an incubus is?

12:08.530 --> 12:11.886
It's a ghost that'll have sex
with someone until they die.

12:12.029 --> 12:13.660
Wow.

12:13.710 --> 12:17.380
That's like what I experienced
when I was in Switzerland.

12:17.420 --> 12:21.130
Something bad,
a bad spirit or a bad entity.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.590
This is the room
that it's generating from.

12:23.630 --> 12:26.840
- What happened in Switzerland?
- When I was being choked.

12:26.890 --> 12:27.850
- You were being choked
in Switzerland?

12:27.890 --> 12:28.890
- Yeah.

12:28.930 --> 12:29.890
- We were just
talking about that.

12:29.930 --> 12:30.890
- What?

12:30.930 --> 12:32.100
- Earlier,
we were talking about--

12:32.140 --> 12:34.100
- Choked by what?
- By an entity like that.

12:34.190 --> 12:35.440
I felt like I was being picked--

12:35.480 --> 12:36.850
- What, a ghost choked you
in Switzerland?

12:36.900 --> 12:39.270
- Yes.
- Wow.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.650
Oh, yes.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.320
There's been many things
that has happened in my life.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.814
That's why it's so
interesting to meet you.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.450
<i>Sue's bombshell about the
Switzerland ghost made me feel</i>

12:48.490 --> 12:51.330
<i>an urgency to get rid
of this entity right away.</i>

12:51.330 --> 12:52.971
<i>The only question was how.</i>

12:52.996 --> 12:54.532
It could always be cleaned.

12:54.617 --> 12:57.449
<i>Ron suggested an exorcism,
so the next morning,</i>

12:57.483 --> 13:00.540
<i>I found an exorcist from Fresno
named brother Carlos...</i>

13:00.590 --> 13:03.380
<i>You have to obey me,
and you have to come out.</i>

13:03.420 --> 13:05.090
<i>In the name of Jesus Christ,
devils.</i>

13:05.130 --> 13:07.309
<i>And booked him
to do an exorcism</i>

13:07.355 --> 13:09.475
<i>in the master bedroom
for the following week.</i>

13:10.153 --> 13:12.273
<i>In the meantime,
Sue had an appointment</i>

13:12.300 --> 13:14.520
<i>to show the house that
she preferred not to cancel.</i>

13:14.560 --> 13:16.810
<i>So before the potential
buyer arrived,</i>

13:16.810 --> 13:19.690
<i>I reminded her to be upfront
about the status of the home.</i>

13:19.690 --> 13:22.940
You just have to be honest with
the person you're showing it to,

13:22.980 --> 13:26.070
and it let them know that
even though there is an entity,

13:26.110 --> 13:28.570
we will be doing
an exorcism very soon,

13:28.610 --> 13:29.820
and that will get rid of it.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.956
That's-- Yes, okay.
That sounds perfect.

13:33.018 --> 13:35.675
- Okay, great. So good luck.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

13:35.730 --> 13:37.670
Oh, thanks.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.250
<i>And moments later,</i>

13:39.290 --> 13:41.750
<i>Sue began her first showing
as the Ghost Realtor.</i>

13:41.840 --> 13:43.801
So the dining room's this way,

13:43.861 --> 13:45.750
and then the kitchen's
to your right.

13:45.810 --> 13:48.016
<i>After the potential buyer
made her way through the house,</i>

13:48.082 --> 13:50.042
<i>it was up to Sue
to close the deal.</i>

13:50.150 --> 13:51.480
So what did you think?

13:51.521 --> 13:53.890
I like it, especially
the walk-in closet.

13:53.930 --> 13:55.350
Oh, a nice, big one.

13:55.390 --> 13:57.520
Yes, a nice, big closet.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.730
And the master bedroom
is really nice.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.400
- Yes.
- I like it, yes.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.820
Wonderful.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.997
Well, I do have to explain
something to you.

14:05.085 --> 14:07.740
Upstairs in the master bedroom,

14:07.740 --> 14:09.070
we did find a entity,

14:09.070 --> 14:13.450
and it was an incubus.

14:13.490 --> 14:14.870
I know you're wondering
what that is.

14:14.910 --> 14:17.330
I have no idea.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.620
Well, that is a pretty evil
spirit, actually,

14:19.670 --> 14:24.630
and he said that
this spirit rapes women

14:24.670 --> 14:28.340
and has sex with them
until they die.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.220
I know it sounds awful,

14:30.260 --> 14:32.445
but we're going to
have it taken care of.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.672
We're going to have an exorcist
come in and get rid of it.

14:35.691 --> 14:38.321
- This is real? Really? Like--
- I know.

14:38.354 --> 14:39.600
I know.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.520
Isn't that unbelievable

14:41.560 --> 14:42.770
that things like this
happen in this world?

14:42.810 --> 14:44.690
So trust me.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.900
Come back in a couple of days,

14:46.980 --> 14:49.610
and you'll see
it's a big difference.

14:49.610 --> 14:50.990
<i>It was clear
Sue was having trouble</i>

14:51.030 --> 14:54.240
<i>keeping buyers interested
with an incubus still present,</i>

14:54.330 --> 14:57.410
<i>but I was hopeful all that
would change after our exorcism.</i>

14:59.381 --> 15:01.471
<i>It was finally
the night of the exorcism,</i>

15:01.511 --> 15:03.865
<i>and after brother Carlos,
our exorcist, arrived,</i>

15:03.914 --> 15:05.851
Sue and I led him upstairs
to the bedroom

15:05.891 --> 15:07.885
where the entity was detected.

15:07.965 --> 15:11.935
So what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna anoint this place.

15:11.975 --> 15:12.992
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

15:12.998 --> 15:14.805
And I'm gonna command
these spirits to leave.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.765
In the martyred name
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

15:16.765 --> 15:18.105
Come out, evil spirits.

15:18.145 --> 15:21.695
Making people believe you
are spirits of dead humans, huh?

15:21.735 --> 15:25.235
Liars.
Liars and deceivers, get out.

15:25.275 --> 15:28.945
Get out of here
and don't ever, ever come back.

15:28.985 --> 15:30.615
<i>After getting rid of the spirit,</i>

15:30.615 --> 15:33.365
<i>Brother Carlos insisted that
he had to cleanse us as well,</i>

15:33.415 --> 15:35.470
<i>as demons can sometimes
attach themselves</i>

15:35.533 --> 15:38.205
<i>to humans and manifest
as physical ailments.</i>

15:38.245 --> 15:41.465
Do you have any health issues?

15:41.505 --> 15:44.125
Are you constantly getting sick?

15:44.125 --> 15:45.425
Do you have migraine headache
hitting you all the time?

15:45.465 --> 15:47.295
I do have one thing,
but it's kind of...

15:47.295 --> 15:48.805
What?

15:48.805 --> 15:51.975
- Private, personal.
- All right.

15:52.015 --> 15:53.185
It's hemorrhoids.

15:53.225 --> 15:55.645
Yeah, that's demonic.
Oh, yeah.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.435
- Okay.
- So how you say it again?

15:57.475 --> 15:59.435
I don't see this demon
very often.

15:59.475 --> 16:02.315
He--em-or-oid?

16:02.315 --> 16:03.815
- Hemorrhoids.
- Hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids.

16:03.855 --> 16:04.815
Yeah, I don't say
this name very often.

16:04.855 --> 16:06.235
Oh, I see.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.985
So let me go ahead and address
this thing right now. Okay?

16:09.025 --> 16:10.985
In the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

16:10.985 --> 16:13.655
I command demons
of hemorrhoids.

16:13.655 --> 16:15.325
I am casting you out,
evil spirits,

16:15.325 --> 16:16.955
In the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

16:16.995 --> 16:18.335
Hemorrhoid demons...

16:18.335 --> 16:20.125
come out!

16:20.165 --> 16:23.165
- Is it gone?
- Wow, you look different.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.175
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

16:25.175 --> 16:27.585
You look like something
just happened, definitely.

16:27.635 --> 16:28.675
Wow.

16:28.675 --> 16:30.358
<i>If Sue noticed
a change that quickly,</i>

16:30.440 --> 16:33.095
<i>I wanted to be sure
to leave no stone unturned.</i>

16:33.135 --> 16:36.595
Can it help with penis size?

16:36.645 --> 16:39.895
You see-- Yeah, okay.

16:39.935 --> 16:43.105
If it's demonic, yeah, I can
cast out the demon from there.

16:43.145 --> 16:47.355
I don't have to say
for the thing to, you know,

16:47.405 --> 16:49.445
increase in size
or dimi-- whatever.

16:49.485 --> 16:52.405
Okay.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.825
In the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

16:55.865 --> 16:57.875
I command all of you demons.

16:57.875 --> 17:02.375
If there's a demon there,
you know,

17:02.415 --> 17:07.175
affecting this man's penis,
male organs,

17:07.214 --> 17:11.714
makin' it smaller, whatever--

17:11.755 --> 17:15.635
If there's any demon there
lodged in his penis right now,

17:15.675 --> 17:17.935
Come out!
In the name of Jesus Christ.

17:17.974 --> 17:19.265
Come out!

17:19.305 --> 17:21.055
You might be free
from this thing already.

17:21.105 --> 17:22.515
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.605
<i>After brother Carlos
addressed my personal demons...</i>

17:24.645 --> 17:27.234
I have an extremely bad back
problem, if that can be helpful.

17:27.234 --> 17:28.234
- Oh, yeah.

17:28.234 --> 17:29.405
<i>He offered to help Sue</i>

17:29.445 --> 17:31.775
<i>by removing the demons
causing her back pain.</i>

17:31.825 --> 17:33.785
And as I am addressing
these demons right now,

17:33.825 --> 17:35.245
I'm gonna be
more aggressive, okay,

17:35.285 --> 17:38.615
because I know you have signs of
someone that have demons inside.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.625
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:40.665 --> 17:44.795
So just make eye contact
with me right now. Okay?

17:44.835 --> 17:47.375
In the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

17:47.415 --> 17:50.085
I command any evil spirit

17:50.085 --> 17:52.425
that the Lord Jesus Christ
has identified

17:52.425 --> 17:55.885
to place divine judgment
for violating this soul.

17:55.925 --> 17:59.185
In the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, I command you now

17:59.225 --> 18:00.935
to get out of this woman
right now, evil spirits.

18:00.935 --> 18:01.935
I command you now to get out.

18:01.975 --> 18:05.105
Demons, look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.

18:05.105 --> 18:06.565
You've been messin' up
with her back?

18:06.605 --> 18:08.025
Right, devils?

18:08.065 --> 18:12.445
I'm commanding you to come out.
I am commanding you to come out.

18:15.325 --> 18:16.695
I am commanding you
to come out!

18:16.745 --> 18:18.365
In the name of Jesus Christ,
come out!

18:18.405 --> 18:20.745
Come out. Get out. Get out.

18:20.785 --> 18:23.455
Come out of Sue's chest.
Come out.

18:23.495 --> 18:25.625
Come out.
Come out, evil spirits.

18:25.665 --> 18:27.085
Come out, evil spirits.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.295
Demons messin' up with
the vertebraes in the neck,

18:29.335 --> 18:30.795
Come out in the name
of Jesus Christ.

18:30.795 --> 18:32.005
Come out.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.715
I want all demons
out of her spine, get out.

18:34.755 --> 18:39.135
Get out. Get out. Get out.

18:39.135 --> 18:40.635
Get out in the name
of Jesus Christ. Get out.

18:41.765 --> 18:43.975
In the name
of Jesus Christ, get out.

18:43.975 --> 18:47.605
Come out. Come out.
Come out. Come out.

18:47.645 --> 18:51.735
In the name of Yeshua, come out.
In the name of Yeshua, come out.

18:51.775 --> 18:53.445
Get out. Look in my eyes.
You have to go now.

18:53.485 --> 18:55.865
- Uh-huh.
- You have to go.

18:55.905 --> 18:57.825
I'm casting you out.
You have to go.

18:57.865 --> 18:58.825
You have to go.

18:58.865 --> 19:02.325
Leave now.
Leave now. Leave now.

19:02.325 --> 19:04.075
- Okay.
- Leave. Leave. Leave.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.625
- Stop it!
- Leave.

19:05.665 --> 19:06.955
- Stop it.
- Leave.

19:06.995 --> 19:08.375
Go now,
and don't ever come back.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.045
Take a deep breath
three times, please.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.345
You didn't hurt her
or anything, right?

19:15.385 --> 19:16.805
- No.
- Okay.

19:16.845 --> 19:20.265
'cause she looks like
she's almost dead.

19:20.305 --> 19:22.845
- Are you okay, Sue?
- Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

19:22.885 --> 19:26.105
I think I'm feeling
a little relief now.

19:26.145 --> 19:28.315
It's amazing.

19:29.416 --> 19:33.126
<i>After cleansing me, Sue,
and the rest of the bedroom,</i>

19:33.311 --> 19:34.785
<i>Brother Carlos felt confident</i>

19:34.821 --> 19:37.085
<i>that the house was now
entirely ghost-free.</i>

19:37.144 --> 19:39.482
After all we did here
in this room,

19:39.534 --> 19:42.364
I'm pretty much certain
that there's no evil spirits

19:42.420 --> 19:44.630
right here in this--
in this bedroom.

19:44.670 --> 19:46.937
<i>And after wishing him well,
I felt like I had done</i>

19:47.009 --> 19:49.430
<i>all I could to reinvigorate
Sue's career.</i>

19:49.430 --> 19:51.310
- He was amazing.
- Yeah.

19:51.350 --> 19:55.020
- So the home is now ghost-free.
- Yeah.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.190
It's a beautiful home,

19:56.230 --> 19:58.900
and I think now
that the ghost is gone,

19:58.940 --> 20:02.270
it's going to be so much
more alluring to people

20:02.320 --> 20:04.019
to come in here
and have a look at it.

20:04.058 --> 20:04.711
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.727 --> 20:08.083
Before I go, I have
a little something for you.

20:08.105 --> 20:09.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.620
- No.
- Yeah, a little gift.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.910
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.464
Oh, my gosh.

20:19.811 --> 20:23.186
I've been doing a little bit
of painting in my spare time,

20:23.304 --> 20:27.140
And I just did this
from imagination, you know.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.793
- Did you?
- Yeah.

20:29.994 --> 20:32.966
I kind of used your
real estate photo for the face

20:33.010 --> 20:36.430
and my imagination
for just the rest of the body.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.190
Very nice.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.980
Thank you so much.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.400
Okay, I'll see you later.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.980
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

20:46.030 --> 20:47.820
Bye.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.030
Just full of surprises here.
