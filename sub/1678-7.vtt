OLDER TED: Kids,
before I met your mother,

00:17.117 --> 00:20.518
when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.281
That love is not a science.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.949
- Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
- SON: We're gonna go watch TV.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.424
OLDER TED: You see, sometimes in life

00:27.527 --> 00:30.155
you just have to accept
that certain things can't be explained,

00:30.263 --> 00:32.128
and that's kind of scary.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.231
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I'm still shaking.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.770
What the... Joke's on you. I have a cold.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.503
Are you guys okay?

00:40.607 --> 00:42.268
Another round,
and back it up for me and Lily!

00:42.375 --> 00:43.501
What happened?

00:43.610 --> 00:47.944
- We saw something, up in the apartment.
- Something bad.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.148
(BOTH MOANING)

00:53.186 --> 00:56.246
I don't know what it is,
but margaritas make me sexy.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.223
Oh, <i>mucho</i> sexy. <i>Te quiero,</i> Marshall.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.653
Oh, my God!

01:05.432 --> 01:06.660
(LILY SCREAMING)

01:09.069 --> 01:10.127
What was it?

01:10.236 --> 01:13.433
Only the craziest, meanest-Iooking mouse
you've ever seen.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.341
Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.913
Baby, it was a mouse. It had whiskers.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.040
What, those things coming out
of his head? Those were antennae.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.779
- Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
- It was a mouse.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.151
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

01:30.790 --> 01:34.385
My story's on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.654
<i>I'm here with Ellen Pierce,</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:38.060
<i>New York's premiere matchmaker,</i>

01:38.164 --> 01:42.567
<i>Ellen, your company "Love Solutions"</i>
<i>boasts a 100% success rate,</i>

01:42.669 --> 01:44.762
<i>- What's your secret?</i>
<i>- Science,</i>

01:45.305 --> 01:49.503
Everything in life can be broken down
to ones and zeros, even love.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.272
All I have to do is input
the variables, run the algorithm,

01:53.379 --> 01:56.871
and presto manifesto,
you have a soul mate and it works!

01:57.383 --> 02:00.511
Just ask all of my happy couples.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.913
(WHISPERING) And these are just
the attractive ones.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.887
I have more photos in the bathroom.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.056
Love Solutions' Ellen Pierce.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.651
A beacon of hope
for New York City's lovelorn.

02:10.763 --> 02:11.923
<i>Robin Scherbatsky,,,</i>

02:12.031 --> 02:13.498
Was that chick at the end really a client?

02:13.600 --> 02:14.760
- Yes.
- We're signing up.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.666
- What?
- Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.228
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.336
I'm not going to a matchmaker.
That's like giving up.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.709
It's the man version of getting a cat.

02:27.847 --> 02:31.715
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur.
And only mammals have fur.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.910
It was a cockroach.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.283
Come on, Lily.
The only way that that was a cockroach

02:35.388 --> 02:38.516
is if it was wearing the skin
of a mouse it just killed.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.491
Oh, my God!

02:42.595 --> 02:44.028
Come on!

02:47.100 --> 02:48.001
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)

02:48.001 --> 02:48.467
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)

02:54.974 --> 02:57.704
Ted! Hurry!
You got to help me, my boat is sinking.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.038
- What?
- My boat is sinking!

02:59.145 --> 03:00.612
- You have a boat?
- Yes, I bought a boat last year

03:00.713 --> 03:03.204
at a police auction. I just got a call
from a guy down at the marina

03:03.316 --> 03:04.783
that it's leaning starboard
at a 45-degree angle.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.546
If I don't get down there right now
it's gonna capsize! Now come on!

03:10.223 --> 03:12.521
Your boat is sinking. That was good.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.918
Come on.
Ted, this is an incredible opportunity.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.988
We'll meet our soul mates, nail them,
and never call them again.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.568
All finished, gentlemen?

03:23.670 --> 03:26.764
Congratulations, you have just taken
your very first step.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.842
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.

03:30.076 --> 03:34.775
I'm so done with the single life.
All the games, the meaningless sex.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.810
You deserve more.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.716
That is so true, Ellen.

03:40.286 --> 03:44.484
I really think I'm ready to stop
being a me, and start being a we.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.222
Hey, is there any way I can
let it be known that I love cuddling?

03:48.328 --> 03:51.889
Oh, of course you... That is so...

03:54.867 --> 03:57.495
It's kind of hard to talk about
with Ted here,

03:57.604 --> 04:01.404
but I just want someone who's not afraid
to hold me at night,

04:02.642 --> 04:04.109
when the tears come.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.703
Ellen, can you help me find her?

04:08.281 --> 04:10.146
- Get out.
- What?

04:11.451 --> 04:13.783
I get 15 guys like you every week.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.047
Jerks who just wanna meet
vulnerable women,

04:16.154 --> 04:18.146
nail them, and never call them again.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.317
Oh, my God, people do that?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.621
Do you wanna do this the easy way,
or the hard way?

04:22.729 --> 04:26.028
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.895
No, that's the easy way.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.095
The hard way is that I stomp the crap
out of you myself.

04:31.404 --> 04:33.838
- Okay, Ted, let's go.
- Not you. You stay.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.409
You're cute.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.569
You're an architect. Good career.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.809
And you didn't use an obvious alias
on your application

04:42.915 --> 04:45.179
like your friend "Jack Package."

04:46.085 --> 04:48.645
- It's pronounced Puh-kaj.
- Get out of here!

04:50.256 --> 04:51.883
You, I can work with.

04:51.991 --> 04:56.792
You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.

04:58.197 --> 05:01.598
No, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.966
It's New York City.
You know, plenty of fish in the sea.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.562
Plenty of fish in the sea.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.835
Yes, there's nine million people
in New York,

05:09.942 --> 05:12.001
4.5 million women.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.579
Of course, you wanna meet somebody
roughly your own age,

05:14.681 --> 05:16.706
let's say, plus-minus five years.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.307
So if we take into account
the most recent census data,

05:19.419 --> 05:22.354
that leaves us with 482,000.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.913
But wait, 48% of those
are already in relationships,

05:26.025 --> 05:28.892
and then you have to eliminate half
for intelligence, sense of humor

05:28.995 --> 05:30.053
and compatibility.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.961
And then you have to take out
the ex-girlfriends, and the relatives

05:33.066 --> 05:35.125
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

05:35.234 --> 05:39.933
And then that leaves us
with eight women.

05:41.641 --> 05:45.077
That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?

05:46.112 --> 05:49.548
There are eight fish
in that big, blue ocean, Ted.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.809
And if you feel confident
that you could reel one into your boat

05:52.919 --> 05:54.716
without me, there's the door.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.413
Do you take credit cards?

06:00.226 --> 06:03.559
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got a good look.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.324
Hey. Seriously,
you have to stop doing that!

06:06.566 --> 06:09.364
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.666
We were just upstairs watching TV.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.240
Oh, gosh.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.409
(GASPS)

06:22.882 --> 06:25.350
Okay. Let's do this.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.493
(SCREAMING)

06:34.660 --> 06:35.627
(SHUSHING)

06:36.262 --> 06:38.355
It's okay. It's over.

06:39.832 --> 06:40.799
(EX CLAIMS)

06:49.575 --> 06:51.668
- So, did you get a good look at it?
- Yeah.

06:51.778 --> 06:56.010
It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton,
like a roach.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.777
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.479
Gray-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.385
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.121
It's a cockamouse.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.090
What?

07:11.197 --> 07:14.098
It's some sort of mutant combination
of the two.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.159
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,
you know...

07:18.438 --> 07:21.407
Did the horizontal, 10-legged,
inter-species cha-cha?

07:22.208 --> 07:24.699
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.476
- But it can.
- And it has.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.944
And it's pissed.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.542
Dude, is everything okay?
You left the front door open.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.017
There was no time.

07:35.922 --> 07:39.050
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?

07:39.158 --> 07:42.559
She said it'd take three days.
It's been five days.

07:42.662 --> 07:43.651
Should I be worried?

07:43.763 --> 07:46.231
Just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.360
Did you just use my name as a verb?

07:50.036 --> 07:52.300
Yeah, we do that behind your back.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.202
Ted out. To overthink.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.932
Also see, Ted up.

07:56.342 --> 07:59.209
Ted up, to overthink something
with disastrous results.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.780
Sample sentence,
Billy Teded up when he tried to...

08:01.881 --> 08:03.644
Okay. I get it.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.783
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
Ted anything up, or out.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.746
I should give it a few more days.

08:11.057 --> 08:14.891
- Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
- Ted. Hi.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.427
I meant to call you.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.793
The computer is still crunching
the numbers.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.866
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.525
You said it was gonna be three days.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.330
Did I? Three days.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.426
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.530
When someone says you're gonna meet
the perfect woman in three days,

08:28.641 --> 08:31.132
you kind of put that in your datebook. So.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.674
How do I say this?
This is gonna be really hard.

08:35.347 --> 08:39.375
Ted, there are absolutely no women
out there for you.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.186
Actually, I got through that okay.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.387
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

08:50.496 --> 08:52.896
I know. There's supposed to be.
I don't know where they are.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.524
But I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.899
- I'm a cute architect.
- How do you think I feel?

08:58.004 --> 09:01.667
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook!

09:01.774 --> 09:04.174
I could maybe find somebody for you
if you were gay.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.801
- Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?

09:05.912 --> 09:07.140
No!

09:08.247 --> 09:11.273
- You're messing with me, right?
- Come see for yourself.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.243
I cannot set you up

09:14.353 --> 09:18.187
unless you have a compatibility rating
of 7.0 or higher. And look.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.324
5.4, 4.8, 5.6...

09:21.427 --> 09:23.122
There's a 9.6 right there.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.924
Don't touch the computer.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.434
Yes. Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.935
She would've been
absolutely perfect for you.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.098
Well, what about the guy you set her
up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

09:35.207 --> 09:37.072
- 8.5.
- So he sucks!

09:37.176 --> 09:40.577
No, 8.5 is an extremely good
match-up quotient.

09:41.213 --> 09:45.240
Sure it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?

09:45.351 --> 09:49.117
9.6 is off the charts.
But Sarah is matched up.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.087
Ted, look. I have lunch. Please.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.386
I promise we will find you somebody.
Don't lose hope.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.421
There are new women turning 18
every day.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.090
It's a whole new species. The cockamouse.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.633
And it's the size of a potato.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.200
So, what now, it's a cockapotatomouse?

10:40.339 --> 10:43.137
Don't make it sound ridiculous.
It's a cockamouse!

10:44.310 --> 10:47.279
My God, this is incredible!
We're like the same person.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.975
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.
She wants to have two children.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.416
Her guilty-pleasure song
is <i>Summer Breeze</i> by Seals and Croft.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.546
Wow, Ted.
Sounds like you're her perfect woman.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.687
And like the majestic seahorse,
it's hermaphroditic.

11:02.795 --> 11:06.060
Obviously, the whole thing
is shrouded in mystery.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.831
For as much as we know
about the cockamouse,

11:08.934 --> 11:11.164
there is still so much we don't know.

11:11.871 --> 11:15.034
Well, we know that there is no such thing
as the cockamouse.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.133
What we don't know
is what you guys have been smoking.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.272
So you really don't believe
in the cockamouse?

11:21.380 --> 11:24.178
Well, I believe that you saw
something perfectly normal,

11:24.283 --> 11:28.413
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,
you know, like the Loch Ness monster.

11:31.323 --> 11:35.817
If by "like the Loch Ness monster"
you mean "totally exists and is awesome,"

11:35.928 --> 11:38.419
then, yeah, it's like
the Loch Ness monster.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.560
Its diet is not unlike our own.
Grains, cereals,

11:42.668 --> 11:45.466
- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
- Okay. This is getting weird.

11:45.571 --> 11:47.038
The similarities go on and on.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.370
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.037
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.646
You want to be her boyfriend.
She already has a boyfriend.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.377
- It's uncanny.
- All right.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.152
But it wouldn't hurt
to check her out, right?

12:01.253 --> 12:05.087
See what my 9.6 looks like in person,
as, you know, a frame of reference.

12:05.191 --> 12:09.287
And if she thinks she can do
11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.962
<i>OLDER TED; That's right, I did the math,</i>

12:15.901 --> 12:18.392
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.

12:18.504 --> 12:22.201
I'm architect Mosby. Sorry.
I just wanted to say my job, too.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.472
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Hi.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.975
So, what are we doing today?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.706
Right, I have a kind of mole on my back.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.941
It's probably nothing.
But I'm a cautious guy.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.813
I'm exactly the same.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.889
(SINGING <i>SUMMER BREEZE)</i>

12:47.066 --> 12:48.124
(MIMICKING GUITAR RIFF)

12:48.234 --> 12:52.432
Sorry about that. <i>Summer Breeze</i>
is my guilty-pleasure song.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.935
Oh, yeah, it's been stuck in my head
ever since I heard it this weekend

12:56.041 --> 12:59.408
- at brunch.
- I love brunch.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.139
It's the best.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.545
As long as I don't have to spend it
with a bunch of phonies.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.408
I like the way you think, architect Mosby.

13:09.188 --> 13:12.021
Hey, this may sound weird.
But it'll definitely sound more weird

13:12.124 --> 13:14.388
once my shirt's off,
so I'm gonna ask you now.

13:14.493 --> 13:17.189
Do you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

13:17.797 --> 13:21.631
That's very sweet, but I'm actually
getting married on Saturday.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.166
Friday night?

13:29.675 --> 13:32.473
Wow. You're getting married.
Congratulations.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.046
- Thank you.
- I'm really sorry I asked you out.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.014
It just felt like there could
be this weird connection between us.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.881
- How crazy am I coming off here?
- Only a little.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.423
Well, by some million-to-one long shot,
and I'm not rooting for this,

13:46.125 --> 13:50.084
you wind up not getting married
this weekend, give me a call.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.455
Okay. But it's not likely.
I look damn good in my dress.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.532
I'm sure you do.

14:00.706 --> 14:03.732
Wow. That's a pretty sophisticated trap.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.111
You think the Road Runner's
gonna fall for it?

14:06.212 --> 14:10.478
Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.
But Marshall and I, we're believers.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.550
We believe.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.847
Yeah, look around.
The universe is mysterious and awesome.

14:14.954 --> 14:18.185
You got the Bermuda Triangle,
ghosts, Bigfoot.

14:18.290 --> 14:21.555
Bad maps, creaky houses,
hillbilly in a gorilla suit.

14:21.660 --> 14:22.627
Aliens?

14:23.329 --> 14:25.923
Come on! You gotta give me aliens!

14:26.031 --> 14:29.831
Stonehenge, Area 51,
there's alien crap all over the place.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.164
You can't be serious?

14:32.271 --> 14:34.569
My friend, you just poked the bear.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.739
So, my 9.6,

14:38.844 --> 14:42.371
beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.579
- Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it was a long shot.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.745
I told her to call me anyway if she
changes her mind. But I don't know.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.756
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's not skip over this.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.687
Raise your hand if earlier today
you hit on an engaged woman?

14:56.829 --> 14:57.796

15:00.566 --> 15:02.727

hate the game.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.034

15:10.142 --> 15:11.200
Oh, jeez.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.505
Hey, Ted, there's a message
on the machine for you.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.045
- Dr. O'Brien.
- What?

"When suddenly, an array of..."

<i>This is Dr, O'Brien, About today,</i>

<i>Listen, I really need to talk to you, Call me,</i>
<i>I'll be at the office all day,</i>

15:27.493 --> 15:29.427
The doctor will see you now.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.233
What should I do?
I should totally go down there, right?

15:37.336 --> 15:40.999
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting
to marry this woman on Saturday.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.336
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.343
Look, if I was marrying the wrong
person and the right person was out there,

15:46.445 --> 15:49.505
and knew it, I'd want that person
to come down to my dermatology office

15:49.615 --> 15:52.482
and tell me so.
In that scenario, I'm not interfering,

15:52.584 --> 15:55.417
- I'm a happy ending.
- (CHUCKLES) Happy ending?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.685
Look, I have to go down there.
I don't know what's gonna happen

15:58.791 --> 16:00.622
when I get there, but I gotta give it a shot.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.594
- All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
- Wait, where are you guys going?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.631
Don't you wanna stay
and see the cockamouse?

16:06.732 --> 16:09.257
Yeah, we're gonna go
make some crop circles.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.493
(CLANGING)

16:13.605 --> 16:16.802
- Oh, my God!
- Holy crap buckets, we got it.

16:16.909 --> 16:20.242
- What do we do with it?
- Calm down, I have a plan.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.779
I told my friend Sudeep about it.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.440
He wants to show it
to the Columbia Biology department.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.542
- But it has to be alive.
- Wait, no, no!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.486
They'll do lab experiments on it.
That's so mean.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.690
Shouldn't we just beat it to death
with a bat?

16:38.897 --> 16:40.296
Hello, again.

16:41.567 --> 16:46.004
I'm glad you came down.
I would prefer to say this to you in person.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.301
Go ahead, Sarah.
You can tell me anything.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.108
You have a basal cell carcinoma.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.740
Anything else?

16:56.582 --> 16:59.779
Your mole. The biopsy came back.

16:59.885 --> 17:03.343
It's not life-threatening,
but we should excise the rest of it.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.784
Wait, then you're still getting married?

17:05.891 --> 17:09.486
- Of course I'm still getting married.
- But we're a 9.6.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.392
- Excuse me?
- Okay, I...

17:12.765 --> 17:15.996
I went to Love Solutions
and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer

17:16.101 --> 17:19.763
that you and I are a 9.6.
Your fiancé's only an 8.5.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.204
- You looked at my file?
- I had to. You're my only match.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.233
Aren't you even a little curious?
The woman who set you up

17:26.345 --> 17:27.835
with your fiancé
thinks we're a better match.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.437
I am getting married on Saturday.

(SINGING <i>SUMMER BREEZE)</i>

17:35.354 --> 17:36.321
Ted.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.448
Look, don't you think you're being
a little impulsive marrying a guy

17:39.558 --> 17:42.254
- you just met a few months ago?
- Don't you think it's a little impulsive

17:42.361 --> 17:45.353
for you to proposition an engaged woman
you don't even know?

17:45.464 --> 17:49.059
See, we're both impulsive.
We're perfect for each other!

17:49.168 --> 17:51.193
- Ted, just calm down.
- Calm down?

17:51.303 --> 17:52.793
You're my only match!

and there were eight fish

17:55.741 --> 17:58.574
- in a sea full of lesbians.
- Okay, Ted, Ted.

18:00.179 --> 18:04.707
Do you honestly believe deep down
that there is no one else out there for you

18:04.817 --> 18:07.012
just because some computer says so?

18:09.154 --> 18:13.750
I didn't use to, but there was math,
I got confused.

18:14.259 --> 18:18.423
Love isn't a science.
You can't calculate a feeling.

18:18.964 --> 18:23.333
When you fall in love with someone,
an 8.5 equals a perfect 10.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.466
You're right.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.935
If this thing is what you say it is,
it could be huge for my career.

18:31.743 --> 18:35.270
Brace yourself, dude.
This is gonna blow your mind-hole.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.048
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.

- It's empty.

Holy mother of God! It's headed this way!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.443
Close the window!

19:55.494 --> 19:56.620
Hi, Ellen.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.862
I think I want my money back.

20:02.167 --> 20:06.399
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, Ted.

20:06.805 --> 20:10.206
I widened the search parameters,
I tweaked the program.

20:10.742 --> 20:14.701
Last night, I stood out on the street
for five hours

20:14.813 --> 20:17.680
showing your photo
to random pedestrians. No takers.

20:18.584 --> 20:22.281
Although this transvestite hooker said
he/she would do you for half price

20:22.387 --> 20:23.979
because you kind of look like John Cusack

20:24.089 --> 20:27.183
and his/her favorite movie was
<i>Say Anything,,,</i>

20:28.160 --> 20:31.527
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of
ice cream. Isn't that a bit cliché?

20:31.630 --> 20:33.120
It's for the bourbon.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.034
This isn't hopeless.
You're gonna find someone for me.

20:37.135 --> 20:40.696
No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.

20:40.806 --> 20:45.709
I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me.
I'm bright. I'm attractive.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.675
You just gotta get back out there
and keep looking.

20:47.779 --> 20:49.679
No. You're never gonna find anybody.

20:49.781 --> 20:53.217
And every year, you're just getting
older and it's getting harder and harder.

20:53.318 --> 20:56.253
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be
up on that wall one of these days.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.755
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

20:58.857 --> 21:02.384
- How do you know?
- I don't know, but I believe.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.225
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
can find love in this crazy city,

21:06.331 --> 21:07.923
then damn it, so can I!

21:08.166 --> 21:09.497
You're losing me.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.063
The point is,
something good's gonna happen to me.

21:13.171 --> 21:17.073
I mean, maybe your computer will help,
maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.607
- So I should keep looking?
- Of course you should.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.549
