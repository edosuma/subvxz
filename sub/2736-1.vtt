- Well, I'll be damned.
- Hi, Sheriff.

16:56.874 --> 16:58.875
<i>- I haven't seen you
since you were about 12.</i>

16:58.876 --> 17:00.977
Well, since your folks moved away.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.480
<i>- Is that Leon? Here, boy.
- [Chuckling]</i>

17:03.481 --> 17:07.250
<i>Sure is. Fourteen years old
and still acts like a knucklehead.</i>

17:07.251 --> 17:10.221
- How's your dad?
- Uh, Dad passed away a few years back.

17:10.222 --> 17:11.622
<i>- [Toilet Flushes]

17:11.623 --> 17:13.891
<i>- [Sheriff] I'm sorry to hear that.
- Next.</i>

17:13.892 --> 17:16.694
He was a good man. He was a great help
when we had that trouble...

17:16.694 --> 17:18.796
<i>- at the old mill years ago.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

17:18.797 --> 17:20.798
<i>[Sheriff]
I think it got to him.</i>

17:20.799 --> 17:23.602
<i>[Chuckling]
I can't believe how you've grown.</i>

17:23.603 --> 17:25.575
- Law enforcement to boot.
- Hmm.

17:25.576 --> 17:26.574
You two know each other?

17:26.575 --> 17:28.406
Sure thing.
Nate was brought up around here.

17:28.407 --> 17:31.410
[Chuckles] Damn, Nate.
I knew you were a hick.

17:31.411 --> 17:33.483
But, like, shit,
this is the middle of nowhere.

17:33.484 --> 17:34.514
Yeah.

17:34.515 --> 17:35.915
- Coffee?
- That'd be great.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.340
Yeah.

17:42.956 --> 17:45.259
That better be my name tag
you're staring at.

- [Groans] Easy there, honeypot.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.635
Oh, you like
the rough stuff, huh?

17:53.636 --> 17:57.939
Hell, I can do that, even all tied up,
I can show a girl a good time.

17:57.940 --> 17:59.376
You like being tied up?

17:59.377 --> 18:01.376
You mean all hog-tied,
bound and gagged...

18:01.377 --> 18:05.147
- to where I can't move a muscle?
- Aw, yeah. That's it, baby.

18:05.148 --> 18:08.350
No. I don't like to be tied up.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.466
So, uh...

18:22.467 --> 18:25.469
why are you going through Greenbrier?

18:25.470 --> 18:29.340
High-profile prisoner. They wanted
to keep the route confidential.

18:29.341 --> 18:33.010
- You going by the old mill road?
- Yeah. That's the plan.

18:33.011 --> 18:36.744
Until we hook up with the main highway
on the other side of the mountain.

- Thanks, Sheriff.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.844
Hey, hey. Give us a call when you
get through the backcountry.

20:04.845 --> 20:07.882
Or give me your cell,
and I'll call you.

20:07.883 --> 20:10.785
Maybe we can grab a beer
on your way back.

just when I'm about
to buy a house.

21:02.242 --> 21:05.911

that old Michael Douglas movie.

21:05.912 --> 21:08.047
You know,

There's an old forest ranger's fire
watchtower near the top of the mountain.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.154

30:02.565 --> 30:03.966
What happened to you?

30:03.967 --> 30:06.535

30:08.939 --> 30:11.808
We were having a good time.

Then it happened.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.914
- What?
- It killed my friends.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.950
"It"? I thought it was
just some hillbilly.

30:28.761 --> 30:33.031
It's got, like, three fingers on one hand.
And it kills to feed.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.966

30:34.967 --> 30:37.469
So then, why doesn't it eat
the animals in the woods?

30:37.470 --> 30:42.441
Because there are none.
It's a cannibal. We're its food.

30:42.442 --> 30:44.644

30:44.645 --> 30:47.147

aren't you, Nate?

30:53.054 --> 30:56.048

30:57.025 --> 30:59.450
Yeah. Two of'em.

31:00.561 --> 31:02.563
Then that's our way out of here.

31:02.564 --> 31:04.866
Down the river.

31:04.867 --> 31:09.004
Now, you take us there, sugar tits,

- compared to a compromise.
- [Chuckling] Hey. Hey.

46:21.402 --> 46:23.369
I just wiped my ass with a $100 bill.

46:23.370 --> 46:28.242
It's comin' out of your share, asshole.
Now, shut the fuck up.

46:28.243 --> 46:31.145
- What do you propose?
- You got one gun. I got two.

46:31.146 --> 46:33.147
These humps have none.

46:33.148 --> 46:37.084
<i>Now, I can't carry
all the bags of cash on my own.</i>

46:37.085 --> 46:40.155
And if you kill me,
that's one less pair of hands.

46:40.156 --> 46:42.391
Plus I have something none of you do.

46:42.392 --> 46:44.727
- Yeah? What's that?
- Infrastructure.

46:44.728 --> 46:46.095
What?

46:46.096 --> 46:48.597
My men will find me.

46:48.598 --> 46:52.501
And all of you can come with us
to a safe house and not be on the run.

46:52.502 --> 46:55.838
<i>And in exchange for that, you give me
one of the bags you're all carrying...</i>

46:55.839 --> 46:58.174
and you all get to keep the other one.

46:58.175 --> 47:00.777
How can you trust him, Floyd?

47:00.778 --> 47:03.373
We can't.

47:05.551 --> 47:07.578
Deal.

47:14.026 --> 47:16.587
Now get this bum up.

47:19.065 --> 47:21.400
Sorry about your friends.

47:21.401 --> 47:24.369
This isn't going to end well.

47:24.370 --> 47:28.173
- I know that.
- Then why are you going along with them?

47:28.174 --> 47:30.175
Up to now, being all chained together...

47:30.176 --> 47:33.137
I really didn't have
much of a choice, did I?

47:35.183 --> 47:39.019
So that's the fourth time we've passed
that tree in the last two hours.

47:39.855 --> 47:42.022
What are you up to, Nate?

47:42.023 --> 47:44.592
Bidin' my time.

47:44.593 --> 47:47.962
Chavez catches on, man, he'll kill you.

47:47.963 --> 47:53.097
He's right, Nate.
Even I noticed. You gotta be careful.

47:55.271 --> 47:58.441
[Nate] You should go back to the road.
Turn yourself in when the police arrive.

47:58.442 --> 48:01.511
I am not going back
through the woods alone, unarmed...

48:01.512 --> 48:04.747
to get sliced up by that hillbilly freak.

48:04.748 --> 48:07.582
I don't know who's worse- him or Chavez.

48:08.652 --> 48:10.654
Listen.

48:10.655 --> 48:14.258
I'll do what I can to help you once
we've reached the ranger station.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.127
I appreciate that, but I think
you should look after yourself first.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.796
Chavez isn't gonna bring anyone
along for the ride that he can't use.

48:19.797 --> 48:21.798
You're damn right.

48:21.799 --> 48:24.302
He'll kill us all for the money.

48:24.303 --> 48:27.171
If that cannibal freak
doesn't beat him to it.

48:28.074 --> 48:31.466
[Exhales]
It's ironic.

48:32.379 --> 48:35.347
- What is?
- Money.

48:35.348 --> 48:37.310
I struggled my whole life
to put myself through school...

48:37.311 --> 48:39.740
so I could get outta here
and make good money.

48:39.741 --> 48:40.987
So?

48:41.288 --> 48:42.618
Now I'm holding in my hands
more money...

48:42.619 --> 48:45.258
than most people
ever make in a lifetime...

48:45.759 --> 48:48.321
and all I wanna do
is get rid of it.

49:12.722 --> 49:15.955

49:19.697 --> 49:22.566

- Piece of cake, man.

49:31.910 --> 49:34.712
<i>Finally, a ride out of this shit-hole.</i>

49:34.713 --> 49:38.241
Wait a minute. That's the tow truck
that ran us off the road.

49:40.419 --> 49:43.923
That's why Crawford here
is gonna go get it for us.

49:43.924 --> 49:48.861
- Right, Crawford?
- I don't know about that, man. I mean-

49:48.862 --> 49:52.598
It's a truck.
Just run over there and check it out.

49:52.599 --> 49:55.568
Come on! We got the cash.
Now let's get the hell out of here!

49:55.569 --> 49:57.904
No way, man! Send soldier boy, damn it!

It's 75 feet straight up

Chavez when we're up there.
