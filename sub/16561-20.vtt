00:13.953 --> 00:15.520
No, I'm not saying that you made it up.

00:15.522 --> 00:16.855
I believe you heard something.

00:16.857 --> 00:18.943
Do you? 'Cause it really
doesn't sound like it.

00:18.968 --> 00:21.760
- I'm gonna take the next one.
- No, Dad, no, come.

00:23.563 --> 00:25.563
- We have rats.
- Or we don't.

00:25.632 --> 00:28.110
We've had two exterminators
go through everything.

00:28.135 --> 00:29.667
- "We"?
- Yes, we, Dad.

00:29.736 --> 00:32.937
We are cohabitating,
and we do have rats.

00:35.275 --> 00:37.942
- We'll talk about this later.
- Yes, we will.

00:42.547 --> 00:45.210
How about that snow, huh?
Springtime in Chicago.

00:45.235 --> 00:47.424
I know what I heard, okay?

00:47.454 --> 00:49.187
We just have to get an
exterminator who knows

00:49.256 --> 00:50.855
what he's doing.

00:53.393 --> 00:54.759
- Hey, Maggie?
- Mm-hmm.

00:54.828 --> 00:56.828
I wanna FaceTime with
Owen before his nap.

00:56.897 --> 00:58.596
I set an alarm on my
phone for an hour from now,

00:58.665 --> 01:00.557
but if I get swamped, can you remind me?

01:00.582 --> 01:02.048
- Sure.
- He was already asleep

01:02.117 --> 01:04.050
when I got home last
night and still conked out

01:04.119 --> 01:07.534
when I left this morning.
I've hardly seen him lately.

01:07.566 --> 01:08.995
Don't worry... I'll remind you.

01:10.168 --> 01:11.220
It hurts like hell, I know.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.726
We're gonna get you upstairs
and the surgeon will fix

01:12.794 --> 01:14.227
the holes the bullet
left in your intestines.

01:14.303 --> 01:15.381
They'll take good care of you.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.306
Dr. Choi, incoming. Trauma 2's open.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.694
Elliot Gallagher, 17,
got beat up at school.

01:22.719 --> 01:24.971
Multiple facial trauma,
chest wall contusions,

01:25.040 --> 01:27.140
GCS of 15 with history
of loss of consciousness.

01:27.209 --> 01:29.708
Elliot, I'm Dr. Choi. Can
you tell us what happened?

01:29.733 --> 01:32.309
Those guys, they caught me.

01:32.334 --> 01:33.847
Make sure his parents are notified.

01:33.915 --> 01:35.461
Let's transfer on my count. Ready?

01:35.486 --> 01:36.981
One, two, three.

01:38.854 --> 01:41.221
Elliot, can you take
a deep breath for me?

01:42.353 --> 01:43.547
Again?

01:43.592 --> 01:44.924
That hurt?

01:44.993 --> 01:46.693
- No.
- Good breath sounds.

01:46.762 --> 01:48.461
Let's get him off the
board and get a chest X-ray.

01:48.530 --> 01:49.659
Right away.

02:01.645 --> 02:03.076
Lungs are up and no broken ribs.

02:03.145 --> 02:04.348
Looks like they're just bruised.

02:04.373 --> 02:05.778
Let's give him 50 of fentanyl for pain.

02:05.803 --> 02:06.942
On it.

02:08.984 --> 02:11.168
Can you turn your head side to side?

02:12.527 --> 02:14.199
Chin to chest?

02:14.856 --> 02:16.652
Good, c-spine's clear.

02:19.494 --> 02:21.328
Elliot, follow the light for me.

02:22.218 --> 02:23.930
Your right eye doesn't
look the same as your left.

02:23.999 --> 02:26.032
I think the orbit's fractured.
Your nose is also broken.

02:26.101 --> 02:27.233
I'm going to quickly realign it.

02:27.302 --> 02:29.202
Pain meds should be working by now.

02:30.841 --> 02:32.472
Sorry.

02:32.846 --> 02:35.292
Hope they caught the boys who did this.

02:36.011 --> 02:37.620
I deserved it.

02:39.748 --> 02:41.881
You gotta castrate me.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.430
What?

02:44.953 --> 02:47.422
I want you to castrate me.

02:48.938 --> 02:50.680
Please.

03:02.909 --> 03:04.662
Are his ankles swollen?

03:04.687 --> 03:06.602
Just look down and check.

03:07.323 --> 03:10.363
Damn it. Yeah, all right. I'm on my way.

03:10.388 --> 03:13.027
- Everything all right?
- Not really.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.885
That was my brother. He's with my dad.

03:14.954 --> 03:17.088
The man's stubborn beyond all belief.

03:17.156 --> 03:20.470
He's had mitral valve regurge
for, like, the last ten years.

03:20.495 --> 03:21.922
Oh, man, faulty valves are tricky.

03:21.946 --> 03:24.814
Yeah, and I don't like
what Jay's describing.

03:24.882 --> 03:26.816
I gotta get to the L station.

03:26.884 --> 03:28.384
Why doesn't your brother bring him in?

03:28.453 --> 03:31.020
Dad hates doctors. Did
I mention he's stubborn?

03:31.089 --> 03:33.633
- Well, don't you have a car?
- I sold it.

03:34.359 --> 03:36.266
Hey, look, man,

03:36.291 --> 03:37.999
waiting for the L train's
just gonna slow you down.

03:38.024 --> 03:39.352
Why don't you take mine?

03:41.799 --> 03:45.634
Actually, I'd like to take you.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.539
- I'll get my coat.
- All right.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.664
I think about sex all the time.

03:54.689 --> 03:56.483
You're 17. It's really...

03:56.508 --> 03:57.695
It's not that unusual.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.797
Sex is for procreation. That's all.

04:00.347 --> 04:03.514
Oh, so how did you come
to that understanding?

04:03.539 --> 04:04.844
My parents.

04:06.688 --> 04:10.334
The reason those guys beat me up...

04:10.359 --> 04:14.530
I was climbing on a
dumpster by the girls' gym

04:14.555 --> 04:17.273
and was looking in a window...

04:17.829 --> 04:19.349
to the shower.

04:19.392 --> 04:23.229
It sounds to me like grounds
for disciplinary action,

04:23.297 --> 04:25.130
maybe, but, I mean, not a beating.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.701
I mean, certainly not castration.

04:30.227 --> 04:33.172
Blonde girls. It's...

04:33.241 --> 04:36.656
it's blonde... blonde
girls. I follow them.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.647
There's this one girl, Lacey.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.529
She's blonde.

04:44.319 --> 04:46.490
I sit behind her in trig.

04:49.993 --> 04:51.842
One day, I...

05:00.186 --> 05:01.995
I cut this off.

05:05.119 --> 05:06.819
She didn't notice.

05:06.844 --> 05:10.346
I'm afraid of... of what I'm gonna do.

05:13.251 --> 05:15.218
I... I was looking up castration online.

05:15.243 --> 05:16.609
They can do it with drugs.

05:16.634 --> 05:19.335
That's what I want...
chemical castration.

05:21.559 --> 05:23.238
I don't wanna hurt her.

05:25.463 --> 05:26.926
Or anyone.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.584
Elliot is very troubled.

05:38.653 --> 05:42.557
The poor kid is just
consumed with sexual thoughts.

05:42.582 --> 05:43.824
Aren't most kids his age?

05:43.849 --> 05:46.225
Yeah, but he's been raised
to believe that sex is wrong

05:46.294 --> 05:48.227
unless it's for procreation.

05:48.296 --> 05:51.030
And repressing his
natural urges is triggering

05:51.099 --> 05:53.629
aggressive impulses, which
he's struggling to control.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.168
- Aggressive?
- He fetishizes blondes.

05:56.237 --> 05:57.770
Stalks them.

05:57.839 --> 05:59.272
We're talking about a sexual predator?

05:59.297 --> 06:01.396
Not a psychopath. I
mean, he has a conscience.

06:01.421 --> 06:04.466
I mean, I think he could definitely
benefit from therapy, but...

06:04.803 --> 06:06.779
I'm not ruling out those meds.

06:07.090 --> 06:10.658
- Chemical castration, really?
- It's temporary, Ethan.

06:10.748 --> 06:12.678
Raping somebody isn't.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.877
We would need the parents' consent.

06:15.946 --> 06:19.752
Dr. Manning, a three-year-old with
a bilateral lower extremity paresis

06:19.777 --> 06:22.490
and gingival lesions in Treatment 4.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.600
Hey, you wanna give me a hand with this?

06:24.625 --> 06:25.691
Sure.

06:28.318 --> 06:31.285
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning, and this
is Mr. Clark, a medical student.

06:31.310 --> 06:32.709
- Hi.
- He's gonna be assisting me.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.174
I'm Amelia. This is my son, Troy.

06:35.199 --> 06:38.160
Hi, Troy. I hear
you're not feeling well.

06:38.229 --> 06:40.955
Troy is speech-delayed.
He only says a few words.

06:40.980 --> 06:42.143
Okay.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.033
I'm gonna check you out. Okay, buddy?

06:45.703 --> 06:47.336
When did this start happening?

06:47.405 --> 06:50.639
A couple weeks ago, he woke up limping.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.775
When it kept getting worse,
I took him in for X-rays,

06:52.844 --> 06:54.844
but they didn't show anything.

06:54.912 --> 06:56.722
The doctor wanted him
to rest for a week,

06:56.747 --> 06:59.949
but it isn't getting any better.

07:00.271 --> 07:03.706
They've been okay at work,
but I... I gotta get Troy well.

07:03.775 --> 07:05.141
I understand.

07:05.210 --> 07:08.974
This morning, his gums started bleeding.

07:09.681 --> 07:11.914
Hey, let me check your chompers, bud.

07:13.852 --> 07:16.044
- Ulcerations.
- Hmm.

07:18.169 --> 07:20.369
He looks quite thin.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.338
Has his appetite been affected?

07:22.406 --> 07:24.373
He's always been a picky eater.

07:24.442 --> 07:26.542
I've got one like that too.

07:26.611 --> 07:28.955
All right, we'll get
a copy of his X-rays.

07:28.980 --> 07:32.014
The leg pain and weakness could
be coming from a lot of things,

07:32.039 --> 07:35.131
so we'll get a CAT scan of
his spine and some blood work,

07:35.156 --> 07:36.643
and hopefully we'll get some answers.

07:36.668 --> 07:37.855
All right.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.208
- Chocky.
- Not now, sweetie, okay?

07:41.233 --> 07:43.839
Chocky, now.

07:44.375 --> 07:47.456
He wants some chocolate milk.

07:47.679 --> 07:49.812
Well, I think we have some
of that in the cafeteria.

07:49.881 --> 07:51.814
I'll have some sent in.

07:51.883 --> 07:54.383
We'll check back in a little while.

07:54.452 --> 07:57.954
All right, here are the rest of them.

08:01.193 --> 08:03.159
Why all the dolls?

08:03.228 --> 08:06.029
As part of my psych residency,
I have to teach high school kids

08:06.098 --> 08:08.200
the responsibilities of having a baby,

08:08.225 --> 08:10.373
so hopefully they'll
exercise a little caution.

08:10.398 --> 08:11.722
Ah.

08:11.747 --> 08:14.418
The sound circuit is
adapted to convert audio data

08:14.443 --> 08:18.646
into analog audio output at the...

08:19.426 --> 08:21.427
speaker. Oh.

08:21.452 --> 08:25.199
Oh, man, too bad you can't
do that with a real baby.

08:25.224 --> 08:27.452
- Okay, can I see it?
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.794 --> 08:33.895
Ah, peripheral port is
coupled to the micro-controller

08:33.921 --> 08:35.587
and connects to the host computer?

08:35.655 --> 08:37.523
Uh-huh, so I can monitor
how the kids are doing.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.291
- It's ridiculous.
- What? Why?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.613
These are cool.

08:40.638 --> 08:43.019
No, I have no maternal instincts.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.081
I have no connection to babies.

08:45.106 --> 08:46.505
I have no intention of having one.

08:46.530 --> 08:48.581
Oh, I'm right there with you.

08:50.299 --> 08:51.798
Good luck.

09:05.755 --> 09:08.422
- Robin?
- Oh, hey.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.009
What's looking good?

09:19.372 --> 09:21.036
I can't decide.

09:28.163 --> 09:29.896
This is where you grew up, huh?

09:29.965 --> 09:33.767
Yep, played a lot of
ball on this street.

09:33.836 --> 09:35.569
Everybody knew everybody.

09:35.637 --> 09:37.637
All the grandmas would
sit on the front porches.

09:37.706 --> 09:40.073
They were like the
original neighborhood watch.

09:40.142 --> 09:42.442
Up there, Mrs. Riley hated noise.

09:42.511 --> 09:45.612
She used to throw a pot
of boiling water out at us.

09:45.681 --> 09:48.302
Caught Jay on the foot one time.

09:49.555 --> 09:51.966
Little different than
the Gold Coast, huh?

09:54.347 --> 09:55.724
It's nice.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.182
- Hey, Pop.
- What are you doing here?

10:03.207 --> 10:04.846
I called him.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.099
Wasted trip.

10:06.143 --> 10:07.775
- I don't need you.
- Are you kidding me?

10:07.800 --> 10:10.291
You missed two days of work,
and you never miss work.

10:10.316 --> 10:12.081
Pop, this is Connor Rhodes.

10:12.149 --> 10:14.299
He's another doc at the Med.

10:14.819 --> 10:16.719
Told you I don't need this.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.854
Come on, you can barely talk.

10:18.923 --> 10:20.789
I'm gonna take medical
advice from someone

10:20.858 --> 10:23.583
who wet the bed till he was nine?

10:24.228 --> 10:25.256
Never changes.

10:25.281 --> 10:26.943
I gotta get back to the district.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.074
Thanks, Jay.

10:28.099 --> 10:30.466
Don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

10:31.771 --> 10:34.636
Mr. Halstead, I'm seeing
some things that tell me

10:34.661 --> 10:36.255
that your heart isn't working very well.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.561
Your fingertips are purple.

10:37.586 --> 10:40.116
You're having a hard
time breathing, and...

10:40.141 --> 10:43.412
your energy seems depleted.

10:43.437 --> 10:45.053
Had this heart thing forever.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.349
It's... it's never been a problem.

10:47.374 --> 10:49.625
Do you mind if I have a listen?

10:49.693 --> 10:52.061
If it'll get you two off my ass.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.272
Apical holosystolic murmur
and the lungs are wet.

11:06.577 --> 11:08.100
In English?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.358
It means that your heart
has been compensating

11:10.383 --> 11:12.647
for the faulty valve
for a very long time,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.223
and now it can't keep up,

11:14.248 --> 11:16.522
so fluid is backing up into your lungs.

11:16.547 --> 11:18.546
It literally means you're
drowning in your own blood.

11:18.571 --> 11:20.061
We need to get you to the hospital.

11:20.086 --> 11:22.520
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Like hell you will.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.800
I'll be damned if I'll
have neighbors see me

11:24.825 --> 11:26.558
hauled out of here in an ambulance.

11:26.627 --> 11:28.694
- Mr. Halstead...
- No.

11:29.930 --> 11:32.264
If we're going, I'm driving.

11:32.289 --> 11:34.255
Oh, no, no, we'll drive.

11:36.504 --> 11:38.537
Ah! I got it.

11:38.606 --> 11:40.272
- I'll call the ambulance.
- No!

11:40.341 --> 11:42.307
Just move your asses.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.941
April, I got a patient walking
into the ambulance entrance.

11:51.966 --> 11:53.973
- Can you get a wheelchair ready?
- Walking in?

11:53.998 --> 11:56.192
Uh-huh, it's Dr. Halstead's dad.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.380
- Hey, you're going to Treatment 6.
- Yep.

11:59.405 --> 12:01.036
Problems getting an ambulance?

12:01.061 --> 12:03.428
- No, problem with the patient.
- I don't need that.

12:03.496 --> 12:05.597
- I got it, I got it.
- Okay.

12:10.470 --> 12:12.334
Easy on the bed.

12:12.839 --> 12:15.029
Damn it, I got it.

12:17.110 --> 12:18.242
All right, let's get him hooked up.

12:18.311 --> 12:19.410
Will, you wanna get him on oxygen?

12:19.479 --> 12:21.379
- Yep, Pop...
- Yeah?

12:21.404 --> 12:22.864
... on a scale of 1 to
10, how bad's the pain?

12:22.889 --> 12:24.355
I've had gas that hurt worse.

12:24.424 --> 12:26.224
All right, T wave
inversions, ST depressions.

12:26.292 --> 12:27.825
It looks like he's having a NSTEMI.

12:27.901 --> 12:29.966
Let's give him 81 milligrams of aspirin

12:29.991 --> 12:31.475
and a dose of nasal nitro.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.614
Let's get cardiac labs,

12:32.639 --> 12:34.806
CBC, CMP, coags, and a chest X-ray.

12:34.874 --> 12:36.641
He's gonna need a formal
echo, but, in the meantime,

12:36.709 --> 12:39.177
let's take a quick look at
the heart with the ultrasound.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.513
Clear.

12:45.294 --> 12:47.537
Bilateral pleural
effusion and congestion.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.320
Yep, you see here?

12:49.389 --> 12:51.622
Mitral valve is wide open
and the LV is dilated.

12:51.691 --> 12:53.621
Mr. Halstead, it's just like we thought.

12:53.646 --> 12:56.429
Your heart is working way too hard
to compensate for your bad valve.

12:56.454 --> 13:00.397
First time I've ever heard of
hard work being a bad thing.

13:00.702 --> 13:02.368
- You got a fix?
- We will.

13:02.393 --> 13:03.732
We're gonna get you an angiogram,

13:03.757 --> 13:05.277
and it'll give us a full
picture of your heart,

13:05.302 --> 13:06.805
and then we're gonna figure out a plan.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.497
Let's get him up to the cath lab.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.969
Don't worry, Pop. We can beat this.

13:11.994 --> 13:13.627
Who the hell's worried?

13:14.405 --> 13:16.182
All right, let's go.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.128
Will?

13:26.995 --> 13:29.627
My dad, his heart. He needs a cath.

13:29.652 --> 13:31.452
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.362
Let me know how it goes.

13:33.890 --> 13:35.556
Natalie?

13:35.625 --> 13:37.691
Head lac in Treatment 2.
I'll shoot you the chart.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.902
And don't forget to FaceTime
Owen as soon as you're out, okay?

13:39.927 --> 13:41.186
Oh, thank you.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.019
- The three-year-old.
- Mm-hmm?

13:43.044 --> 13:44.378
Test results are back.

13:44.403 --> 13:46.900
CT was clean, blood work
indicates mild anemia.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.932
Mm, nothing to explain
the limping or the lesions.

13:50.143 --> 13:52.613
Maybe we're dealing with lead
poisoning or some sort of tox?

13:52.638 --> 13:56.072
Yeah, um, let's do a tox workup
and look for heavy metals,

13:56.097 --> 13:57.764
and get a babygram while you're at it.

13:57.841 --> 13:59.708
Okay. It could also be abuse.

13:59.777 --> 14:01.310
- Let's not go there yet.
- Can I help you?

14:01.378 --> 14:03.312
- It's our son, Elliot.
- They said he was in a fight.

14:03.380 --> 14:04.680
We got here as quick as we could.

14:04.748 --> 14:07.316
- We got a call from his school.
- Okay, Dr. Choi?

14:07.384 --> 14:09.618
- He'll take you to him.
- Dr. Choi, Stan Gallagher.

14:09.687 --> 14:11.486
- This is my wife, Debbie.
- What happened?

14:11.555 --> 14:14.137
Uh, Elliot got into an
altercation at school

14:14.162 --> 14:15.928
and suffered an orbital
blowout fracture.

14:15.953 --> 14:17.986
The eye surgeons want
to get him to surgery.

14:18.011 --> 14:19.065
He's right here.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.889
Oh, my God.

14:22.369 --> 14:24.944
Oh, my poor baby.

14:26.092 --> 14:28.224
Elliot, who did this to you?

14:32.818 --> 14:35.548
He's still a little
groggy from the pain meds.

14:35.617 --> 14:37.750
Why don't we let him rest while we talk?

14:41.935 --> 14:43.676
The bracelets you're
wearing have a sensor

14:43.701 --> 14:47.703
which registers when you feed,
bathe, or diaper the baby.

14:48.052 --> 14:51.174
If you shake the baby
to stop its crying,

14:51.242 --> 14:53.926
it will shut down and
register as being abused.

14:53.951 --> 14:55.978
Are you a real doctor?

14:56.251 --> 14:58.514
Sometimes I wonder.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.470
Uh, anyways,

15:00.495 --> 15:03.709
uh, recent studies
have shown that talking,

15:03.755 --> 15:06.283
reading and singing to babies

15:06.308 --> 15:08.876
is crucial for early brain development,

15:08.901 --> 15:12.407
80% of which occurs during
the first three years of life.

15:12.432 --> 15:14.632
These dolls record the
amount of time you spend

15:14.657 --> 15:17.691
doing these activities, so,
obviously, the more, the better.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.830
Need anything, Dr. Reese?

15:19.855 --> 15:22.722
Uh, no, I'm fine, Mr. Sexton.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.784
Any questions?

15:27.829 --> 15:29.149
I don't get it.

15:29.174 --> 15:30.697
We're supposed to be talking to a doll?

15:32.367 --> 15:34.701
Or reading or singing, mm-hmm.

15:34.769 --> 15:36.102
Any other questions?

15:36.171 --> 15:38.187
What operating system are the dolls on?

15:38.212 --> 15:40.846
I don't know, and, really,
why is that relevant?

15:40.915 --> 15:43.533
I have PE today. What should
I do with the doll then?

15:43.558 --> 15:46.218
That is a problem you
will have to deal with.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.412
The point of this is
to understand the impact

15:48.437 --> 15:50.737
having a baby would have on your life.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.219
I will see you all at the end of the day

15:55.244 --> 15:56.877
to check on your dolls.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.101
So a kid got beat up.

16:02.505 --> 16:04.505
What does he need a psychiatrist for?

16:04.574 --> 16:07.642
Well, Elliot was caught peeping on girls

16:07.710 --> 16:10.545
- in the shower at school.
- Oh, my God.

16:10.613 --> 16:12.313
Wait till I get him home.

16:12.382 --> 16:15.349
But much more troubling
are some violent impulses

16:15.418 --> 16:18.453
that, so far, he hasn't acted upon.

16:18.521 --> 16:20.362
And there is something we can do.

16:20.387 --> 16:22.457
Elliot wants us to give him a medication

16:22.525 --> 16:24.759
that would turn off his testosterone.

16:24.828 --> 16:27.247
This would significantly
decrease his sex drive

16:27.272 --> 16:30.474
and make it much easier for
him to control these impulses,

16:30.542 --> 16:32.442
but we do need your permission to do it.

16:32.511 --> 16:33.977
"Turn off his testosterone"?

16:34.046 --> 16:35.912
What exactly are you talking about?

16:35.981 --> 16:38.949
The medical term is chemical castration.

16:39.017 --> 16:41.585
- What?
- It's completely reversible.

16:41.653 --> 16:43.987
The idea would be to combine
it with traditional therapy

16:44.056 --> 16:46.523
with the hope of ultimately
weaning him off the medication.

16:46.592 --> 16:48.504
No, no way.

16:49.461 --> 16:52.081
Elliot could very well be
on the verge of acting out

16:52.106 --> 16:54.973
on some very disturbing impulses,

16:54.998 --> 16:56.557
including rape.

16:56.602 --> 16:59.356
He would never do anything like that.

17:00.293 --> 17:01.510
You people are sick.

17:01.535 --> 17:04.107
Again, this was your son's idea.

17:04.561 --> 17:05.994
Elliot is torn up about this.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.487
He's scared he may not
be able to stop himself.

17:08.532 --> 17:10.489
This is ridiculous.

17:11.169 --> 17:14.050
Fix his eye, and we're taking him home.

17:23.088 --> 17:26.122
- Where's your dad?
- The restroom.

17:26.191 --> 17:27.557
He shouldn't be up after his cath.

17:27.626 --> 17:28.791
He couldn't use a bedpan?

17:28.860 --> 17:30.493
Practically threw it at my head.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.517
- I'm here if you need me.
- I won't.

17:49.064 --> 17:51.212
So, Mr. Halstead,

17:51.574 --> 17:53.759
the results of your cardiac cath show

17:53.784 --> 17:56.952
that your heart has been
under stress for so long

17:57.020 --> 17:59.621
from the mitral valve regurgitation...

17:59.690 --> 18:02.250
that it's basically giving up.

18:02.275 --> 18:04.842
This is why I told you to
get it checked regularly.

18:04.911 --> 18:07.211
If we knew about the regurge,
we could've gotten ahead of this.

18:07.281 --> 18:09.248
Yeah, so what? I'll fix it now.

18:09.316 --> 18:12.084
Well, there's another
issue, unfortunately.

18:12.152 --> 18:15.821
Your left anterior descending
artery is 80% blocked.

18:15.890 --> 18:18.328
Now, that is the largest artery.

18:18.353 --> 18:20.492
It supplies half the heart with blood.

18:20.561 --> 18:23.395
The question is "Am I done?"

18:23.464 --> 18:25.697
I can do a surgical
replacement of the valve,

18:25.722 --> 18:27.705
and, while I'm in there,

18:27.730 --> 18:29.368
do a bypass for the blocked artery.

18:29.436 --> 18:31.270
Are you talking open heart surgery?

18:31.338 --> 18:33.916
It would involve
opening your chest, yes.

18:36.712 --> 18:39.650
Now, if you wanted to go non-surgical,

18:39.675 --> 18:42.514
a cardiologist could place
a clip on the mitral valve

18:42.583 --> 18:44.182
to try and control the regurge

18:44.251 --> 18:46.791
and do angioplasty...

18:46.816 --> 18:48.188
to open up the blocked artery.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.847
Do you have a good cardiologist?

18:49.916 --> 18:54.352
We do, but I... I strongly recommend

18:54.421 --> 18:56.244
that you let me operate.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.993
The long-term results of
surgery are much better.

18:59.018 --> 19:00.751
Mm-hmm, exactly.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.658
I'm going non-surgical.

19:05.250 --> 19:08.118
- Pop...
- Hey, if you don't like it,

19:08.187 --> 19:10.087
you don't have to be here.

19:12.683 --> 19:13.949
Fine.

19:17.158 --> 19:19.025
I'll set it up.

19:19.050 --> 19:20.322
Yeah.

19:21.086 --> 19:22.541
Hey.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.478
Now, you know I should be
cracking his chest, right?

19:25.564 --> 19:27.608
So why did you give in?

19:27.633 --> 19:29.399
Hey, you're the one who gave
him the non-surgical option.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.056
No, I laid out his choices, Will.

19:32.081 --> 19:34.137
- I pushed for the surgery.
- Not hard enough.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.772
You're his son.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.908
You should be the one
trying to convince him.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.696
He won't listen to me.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.782
My dad considers me
something of a disappointment.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.652
Oh, yeah, he didn't even
want me to go to college.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.321
Says a real man goes right to work.

19:53.274 --> 19:54.858
He doesn't give a damn
what I have to say.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.960
So why don't you get Jay
to try to talk to him?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.629
It won't help.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.797
No, Jay and him have their own history.

20:05.426 --> 20:07.298
Everything's coming back normal.

20:07.323 --> 20:10.376
Maybe we're dealing with
some sort of weird vasculitis.

20:10.401 --> 20:13.218
Henoch-Schonlein purpura
or Kawasaki disease?

20:13.243 --> 20:15.783
Or possibly an infectious
disease or rickettsia

20:15.808 --> 20:17.808
like Rocky Mountain Fever...

20:17.833 --> 20:19.633
- Chocky, now!
- It's okay, baby.

20:19.702 --> 20:20.801
We'll get you some chocky.

20:20.869 --> 20:22.736
Uh, the chocolate milk never came?

20:22.805 --> 20:25.539
No, the cafeteria was out,
and he won't drink the plain.

20:25.608 --> 20:28.039
Well, you can't fault a kid for
knowing what he likes, right?

20:28.064 --> 20:29.977
Is there something else that he likes?

20:30.045 --> 20:31.649
Graham crackers.

20:31.674 --> 20:32.876
When I get home at night,

20:32.901 --> 20:35.633
all he wants is chocolate
milk and graham crackers.

20:35.696 --> 20:38.931
It's hard not to give in
when it's late, and I'm tired.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.866
Let me go see what I can find.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.234
Uh, you said he's picky at night.

20:42.303 --> 20:43.902
Is he better during the day?

20:43.971 --> 20:45.771
I'm pretty sure he eats other things.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.005
Pretty sure?

20:47.074 --> 20:48.674
He has a couple sitters.

20:48.742 --> 20:51.030
The neighbor's kid, the woman upstairs.

20:51.055 --> 20:53.852
It's possible they're not
as firm as they ought to be.

20:54.682 --> 20:57.649
I can't afford daycare.

20:57.718 --> 20:59.718
I understand.

20:59.787 --> 21:01.805
I'm gonna send a nurse in

21:01.830 --> 21:04.094
to draw blood for one more test.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.713
Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher,
I need to get Elliot up

21:19.738 --> 21:20.799
to pre-op holding.

21:20.824 --> 21:23.308
The eye surgeon will be
calling for him any minute.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.824
We'll be in the waiting room.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.376
I'm guessing your parents
told you they wouldn't approve

21:39.401 --> 21:41.119
the chemical castration.

21:42.614 --> 21:43.806
No,

21:44.160 --> 21:47.612
but my mom read me Thessalonians 4:3.

21:47.853 --> 21:49.452
God's will is for you to be holy,

21:49.521 --> 21:52.337
so stay away from sexual
sin and immorality.

21:54.359 --> 21:56.760
Both Dr. Charles and I tried,

21:56.828 --> 21:58.061
but since you're still a minor...

21:58.130 --> 21:59.512
Yeah, I figured.

21:59.537 --> 22:01.207
All right, whatever.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.317
Look,

22:04.191 --> 22:05.652
I'll talk to Dr. Charles

22:05.677 --> 22:08.278
and see if we can come up
with some other options.

22:13.053 --> 22:15.153
All right, numbers look good.

22:15.221 --> 22:16.454
Breathing great.

22:16.523 --> 22:18.322
Feel like I could pitch nine innings.

22:18.391 --> 22:20.309
It's what every team wants...
a 60-something starter

22:20.334 --> 22:21.623
with a bum ticker.

22:21.648 --> 22:24.862
At least nobody had to cut
my chest open to fix it.

22:24.931 --> 22:27.216
Admit it, kid, I was right.

22:27.398 --> 22:28.857
You got that fancy degree,

22:28.902 --> 22:30.768
but I'm still the one calling the shots.

22:30.837 --> 22:32.637
I didn't say this course
of treatment wouldn't work.

22:32.706 --> 22:35.269
I was more concerned
with the long-term.

22:35.294 --> 22:37.041
That right?

22:37.110 --> 22:38.843
'Cause to me it looks like
you're back-pedaling so much

22:38.912 --> 22:40.873
you're gonna start sweating.

22:42.941 --> 22:46.177
Oh, believe me, that is the
last you'll hear about it.

22:47.154 --> 22:48.498
Yeah.

22:49.037 --> 22:51.402
Well, since you made me
miss the end of the game,

22:51.427 --> 22:52.834
let's, uh,

22:53.701 --> 22:55.647
see if I can find some highlights.

22:55.692 --> 22:57.625
I guess I should start with an apology.

22:57.694 --> 22:59.068
And for the foreseeable future...

22:59.093 --> 23:01.153
The cleanest, whitest white.

23:03.956 --> 23:05.060
Yeah?

23:05.931 --> 23:09.047
Hey, Dr. Charles,
you... you got a second?

23:09.072 --> 23:12.607
- Uh, yeah, kind of.
- Okay.

23:17.114 --> 23:19.114
I'm worried about Robin.

23:19.182 --> 23:21.483
She... she's not acting like herself.

23:21.551 --> 23:22.951
Hmm.

23:24.396 --> 23:27.856
She is, uh, she's convinced
that there's rats in my condo,

23:27.924 --> 23:29.891
but I haven't seen them or heard them,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.513
and no exterminator can find them.

23:32.796 --> 23:34.963
Rats can be pretty clever.

23:35.031 --> 23:37.185
Not that clever.

23:37.904 --> 23:40.701
And, aside from that, lately I...

23:40.726 --> 23:44.139
there are times when
I find Robin just...

23:44.164 --> 23:46.802
staring off into space.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.001
Well, I mean, that's not that odd.

23:51.069 --> 23:52.309
I mean, I do that all the time.

23:52.334 --> 23:55.405
- It must be a family trait.
- I think it's more than that.

23:55.474 --> 23:56.895
How so?

23:58.143 --> 24:01.557
Like I said, she's not
acting like herself.

24:01.582 --> 24:05.782
I... I just feel like there's
something off with her.

24:05.851 --> 24:09.352
Well, I mean, there is
that new living situation.

24:09.708 --> 24:12.457
Cohabitation can be awful stressful.

24:13.612 --> 24:15.817
Dr. Charles, I hope you realize
that I wouldn't have come here

24:15.842 --> 24:17.449
if I didn't think this was important.

24:17.466 --> 24:18.692
And you know what? I appreciate that,

24:18.717 --> 24:20.483
but I was supposed to be
on a conference call, like,

24:20.534 --> 24:23.502
two minutes ago, so can
we pick this up later?

24:23.633 --> 24:26.387
Yeah, all right, you bet.

24:27.543 --> 24:29.692
- Well, thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

24:53.017 --> 24:55.082
- Did you find anything?
- We did.

24:55.743 --> 24:58.644
Based on Troy's limited diet,
we checked his vitamin C levels.

24:58.712 --> 25:01.013
The results show a
significant deficiency.

25:01.081 --> 25:02.769
Well below normal.

25:02.950 --> 25:04.249
Troy has scurvy.

25:04.318 --> 25:06.151
It's what's causing his symptoms.

25:06.220 --> 25:08.058
I don't understand.

25:08.254 --> 25:11.023
Scurvy? Isn't that something
sailors used to get?

25:11.091 --> 25:13.416
It was, historically, but anybody with

25:13.441 --> 25:15.794
prolonged dietary
deficiencies is susceptible.

25:15.863 --> 25:17.029
Well, how is that possible?

25:17.097 --> 25:18.455
We were surprised too.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.998
It's not something we see.

25:20.067 --> 25:22.668
It's been all but eradicated
in developed countries

25:22.736 --> 25:26.285
because it's easily preventable
with a balanced diet.

25:27.339 --> 25:29.298
You mean he's sick
because of what he eats?

25:29.323 --> 25:31.122
More like what he doesn't eat.

25:31.191 --> 25:33.120
It's a parent's job, Ms. Bohlen,

25:33.145 --> 25:35.761
to make sure their children
get nutritious foods.

25:36.338 --> 25:38.673
- Excuse me?
- This never should have happened.

25:38.698 --> 25:40.749
You should have been
monitoring Troy's diet.

25:40.774 --> 25:42.040
That's easy for you to say.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.510
You know nothing about my life.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.078
I work two jobs to support my son.

25:47.147 --> 25:50.698
I am gone from 6:00
a.m. to 8:00 at night.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.681
You have no right to judge.

25:52.706 --> 25:55.207
I would do anything to protect him.

25:55.232 --> 25:56.498
Excuse me.

25:56.523 --> 25:58.518
Please explain the course of treatment.

26:08.022 --> 26:10.622
Mr. Halstead, I'm Sharon Goodwin,

26:10.691 --> 26:13.859
executive director of
patient and medical services.

26:13.928 --> 26:15.894
I thought I should say hello.

26:15.963 --> 26:17.822
Well, how you doing?

26:17.847 --> 26:20.581
Well, better question
is, how are you doing?

26:20.650 --> 26:25.452
Oh, other than a lack of
sports channels in this place,

26:25.521 --> 26:27.321
I'm feeling pretty all right.

26:27.390 --> 26:29.990
You know, we think quite
highly of your son around here.

26:30.059 --> 26:33.472
Oh, kid's got you snowed, huh?

26:34.997 --> 26:36.797
You know, you look a little pale.

26:36.866 --> 26:39.500
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

26:39.786 --> 26:41.219
I'm fine.

26:43.704 --> 26:45.806
Page Dr. Rhodes.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.474
I'm concerned about your breathing.

26:49.543 --> 26:52.134
I'm gonna increase your oxygen.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.281
- What happened?
- He's throwing runs of PVCs.

26:56.350 --> 26:58.017
Give him the ultrasound.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.750
How you feeling, Mr. Halstead?

27:00.775 --> 27:02.775
Like I just told her, I'm feeling fine.

27:02.844 --> 27:05.411
I don't think you're doing
as well as you say you are.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.713
Why don't we have a look, huh?

27:10.935 --> 27:12.735
Half the mitral valve clip came off.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.939
It's flopping around. We
need to get you to surgery.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.497
Can you fix it? Like before?

27:18.566 --> 27:20.566
No, we can't. We need
to operate, and quickly.

27:20.634 --> 27:22.501
If the other half comes
loose, the clip could end up

27:22.570 --> 27:25.252
in your brain or somewhere else
you definitely don't want it.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.457
Wait...

27:26.482 --> 27:28.387
This is not up for
discussion, Mr. Halstead.

27:28.412 --> 27:31.545
No, just... just don't tell Will.

27:31.570 --> 27:33.310
I don't wanna have to hear him crowing.

27:34.427 --> 27:36.795
We won't, but I'm afraid
he's going to find out anyway.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.763
Yeah, yeah, okay.

27:48.655 --> 27:50.312
Sorry, hold on.

27:53.695 --> 27:55.495
Hey, what's up?

27:55.564 --> 27:57.263
I can't find my wallet.

27:57.332 --> 27:59.913
Oh, let me get it.

28:02.537 --> 28:04.413
My coffee, her yogurt.

28:07.761 --> 28:09.275
Come on, go sit down.

28:09.344 --> 28:10.810
I think someone stole it.

28:10.879 --> 28:13.051
Oh, my God, now I'm going to
have to cancel my credit cards

28:13.076 --> 28:15.276
and get a new driver's license.

28:18.386 --> 28:20.286
- That it?
- Oh, thank God.

28:20.355 --> 28:23.489
Ah, the old side pocket.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.590
Is everything okay, honey?

28:29.831 --> 28:31.164
Damn it, Dad, I know that look.

28:31.232 --> 28:32.799
You're trying to shrink me.

28:32.867 --> 28:34.400
- We're just talking.
- We're having some coffee...

28:34.425 --> 28:36.277
No, we're not just talking.
You never just talk to me.

28:36.302 --> 28:38.569
- It is always a psych evaluation.
- Robin, come on.

28:38.594 --> 28:40.373
Just because you are a head case, Dad,

28:40.442 --> 28:41.674
does not mean that I am.

28:41.743 --> 28:44.744
Stop looking for things
that aren't there.

28:48.817 --> 28:51.579
Thank you for your participation.

28:51.618 --> 28:53.453
Thank you for your participation.

28:53.521 --> 28:55.961
Thank you for your participation.

28:57.006 --> 28:59.720
Thank you. Uh, Marla,
would you hang back a sec?

28:59.745 --> 29:01.954
- Uh, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

29:02.334 --> 29:05.875
- Your score, very impressive.
- Thanks.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.901
You fed it regularly
at two-hour intervals

29:08.970 --> 29:12.133
and verbally interacted
a total of six hours.

29:12.164 --> 29:14.374
You said more was better.

29:14.442 --> 29:17.844
Uh, how did you have
time to do anything else?

29:17.912 --> 29:20.546
Uh, multi-tasking.

29:22.484 --> 29:23.883
You hacked your doll.

29:23.952 --> 29:25.918
What? No.

29:25.987 --> 29:28.001
Okay, just because I am 26,

29:28.026 --> 29:30.149
don't think I am some old fool.

29:30.174 --> 29:33.142
This score is impossible.

29:34.067 --> 29:35.281
Marla.

29:36.413 --> 29:38.961
Yeah, I hacked it.

29:44.639 --> 29:45.875
Don't worry, Mr. Halstead.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.967
We're gonna get that mitral valve fixed.

29:50.211 --> 29:51.516
Damn it.

29:52.745 --> 29:54.337
The kid was right.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.655
Not so much a kid anymore, is he?

30:03.425 --> 30:04.891
No.

30:06.305 --> 30:10.696
Did you know he put
himself through college?

30:11.966 --> 30:16.305
I told him... told him
it was a waste of time

30:17.763 --> 30:20.515
and damned if I was gonna pay for it.

30:22.377 --> 30:24.938
Well, I'm sure you're very proud of him.

30:29.298 --> 30:32.138
That doesn't even begin to say it.

30:33.762 --> 30:36.318
He made something of his life.

30:39.461 --> 30:41.870
He's a better man than I am.

30:47.355 --> 30:49.440
I don't think he feels that way, sir.

30:51.179 --> 30:54.167
And I'm sure that he
wouldn't want you to either.

31:01.970 --> 31:04.571
We need to get started,
Mr. Halstead, are you ready?

31:06.988 --> 31:08.242
Yeah.

31:09.858 --> 31:12.792
I spoke to the surgeon.
Everything went great.

31:12.861 --> 31:14.460
Once the dressing is off, your vision

31:14.529 --> 31:16.227
should be back to normal.

31:16.998 --> 31:19.102
I'll be back in a bit to check on you.

31:27.509 --> 31:28.844
Hey.

31:28.869 --> 31:30.235
Hey.

31:30.912 --> 31:33.267
I went off on that boy's mom.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.633
Oh?

31:35.140 --> 31:38.074
- But it was really about me.
- Mm.

31:38.174 --> 31:40.516
I wasn't mad at her.
I was mad at myself.

31:43.057 --> 31:45.057
Am I a horrible mother?

31:45.126 --> 31:47.224
Yes, you are.

31:49.039 --> 31:51.591
Nat, you're just having
working mom's guilt.

32:02.010 --> 32:04.943
Relax, man, Dad's too stubborn to die.

32:05.814 --> 32:07.615
Any word?

32:08.309 --> 32:09.857
Not yet.

32:10.552 --> 32:12.352
I heard you were there when
he went back into failure.

32:12.377 --> 32:14.497
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for jumping in.

32:14.522 --> 32:16.288
Well, it's good to
flex the nursing muscles

32:16.313 --> 32:17.935
every now and then.

32:19.201 --> 32:20.734
He did great.

32:20.989 --> 32:22.962
Brand new mitral valve
is fully functioning.

32:23.031 --> 32:24.397
Shouldn't give him any more problems.

32:24.465 --> 32:25.795
Told you.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.529
- Thanks, man.
- You got it.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.379
- Nice work, Dr. Rhodes.
- Thank you.

32:29.404 --> 32:30.450
Well, I'm gonna head back to the house

32:30.475 --> 32:32.909
'cause he's probably
gonna need some stuff.

32:32.934 --> 32:33.984
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

32:34.009 --> 32:35.388
- See you, Jay.
- Yeah.

32:35.943 --> 32:37.568
Thanks, Connor.

32:38.679 --> 32:41.138
If my dad hadn't pulled through...

32:43.250 --> 32:44.466
Yeah.

32:45.862 --> 32:48.357
I gotta say, man, what you guys have?

32:48.382 --> 32:49.989
It's pretty great.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.291
Are you serious?

32:52.359 --> 32:53.892
All we do is fight.

32:53.961 --> 32:56.428
Yeah, well, me and my
dad... we barely even talk.

32:56.497 --> 32:58.597
That doesn't sound too bad to me.

33:00.809 --> 33:02.735
Take my word for it, Will.

33:02.803 --> 33:04.481
You got a good thing going.

33:16.165 --> 33:17.541
Elliot?

33:21.722 --> 33:23.033
Elliot?

33:53.542 --> 33:55.292
Elliot, what are you doing?

33:56.524 --> 33:58.487
She looked cold.

33:59.273 --> 34:00.995
Step away from her.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.970
Now.

34:16.443 --> 34:17.775
Elliot.

34:18.647 --> 34:20.723
Elliot. Elliot, open the door.

34:20.748 --> 34:21.931
Page security!

34:21.956 --> 34:23.034
Elliot!

34:24.752 --> 34:27.351
Elliot?

34:28.922 --> 34:30.422
I need a gurney with soft restraints

34:30.491 --> 34:32.003
and some ABD pads.

34:34.222 --> 34:36.639
Get me some ice and 50
mics fentanyl IV now,

34:36.664 --> 34:37.737
and page Urology.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.078
Just relax, Elliot, Elliot, Elliot.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.931
Just relax, buddy.

34:50.735 --> 34:53.165
The procedure to repair the
testicles is complicated,

34:53.190 --> 34:55.005
but the urologist is optimistic.

34:55.074 --> 34:56.610
How did this happen?

34:57.945 --> 34:59.711
What did we do?

34:59.780 --> 35:01.413
You know, in my
experience, there's actually

35:01.481 --> 35:04.415
very little to be gained
from looking backwards.

35:04.751 --> 35:07.548
The important thing to focus on is...

35:07.573 --> 35:09.306
"what do you do now?"

35:21.535 --> 35:23.019
Hey.

35:23.718 --> 35:25.017
I just saw Natalie.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.906
She told me your dad's in the hospital.

35:27.975 --> 35:30.275
Yeah, mitral valve and blockage.

35:30.344 --> 35:32.134
He should be awake now.

35:32.159 --> 35:33.620
I'm headed up.

35:34.848 --> 35:38.455
Will, I'm glad he's doing well, but...

35:38.486 --> 35:41.159
how come I had to hear it
from Natalie and not you?

35:41.822 --> 35:43.292
Yeah, sorry.

35:43.317 --> 35:46.034
It's been a little crazy.

35:47.627 --> 35:49.581
You had time to tell her.

35:51.765 --> 35:53.665
Listen, why don't you come with me?

35:53.734 --> 35:57.230
If Dad's up for it, I'll introduce you.

35:57.604 --> 36:00.714
No, just let me know how he's doing.

36:02.376 --> 36:03.816
I will.

36:11.985 --> 36:13.451
- Yeah?
- Am I interrupting?

36:13.520 --> 36:14.819
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

36:14.888 --> 36:17.649
I have something to show you.

36:18.859 --> 36:21.126
Proof that we have got rats.

36:21.194 --> 36:24.024
I picked up some of their droppings.

36:38.204 --> 36:40.704
I don't understand. They
were... they were here.

36:43.852 --> 36:45.548
They were here!

36:47.754 --> 36:49.095
Weren't they?

36:54.073 --> 36:57.565
Honey, I'm saying this
as a dad, not a shrink.

36:58.598 --> 37:02.000
I would just feel a whole lot
better if we could get somebody

37:02.069 --> 37:06.565
to, you know, take
a... take a look at you.

37:10.477 --> 37:12.115
What do you say?

37:21.388 --> 37:22.609
Okay.

37:23.861 --> 37:25.367
Okay.

37:26.726 --> 37:28.426
So did you flunk her?

37:28.495 --> 37:30.460
- No, I couldn't.
- Mm.

37:30.485 --> 37:31.555
She was overwhelmed.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.485
She's taking all these AP courses

37:33.510 --> 37:35.891
and doing all that extracurricular
stuff that you gotta do

37:35.916 --> 37:38.470
- to get into a good college.
- Man, I hear you.

37:38.495 --> 37:40.055
Math Club?

37:40.080 --> 37:42.930
- A lot of better ways to spend my time.
- Mm-hmm.

37:44.034 --> 37:47.313
And the thing is, I did it too.

37:48.195 --> 37:49.627
I hacked my doll when
I was in high school

37:49.652 --> 37:51.352
'cause I was overwhelmed.

37:51.377 --> 37:52.744
Nice.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.094
I mean, to tell you the
truth, Noah, the real reason

37:57.119 --> 37:58.782
I don't wanna have kids...

37:58.807 --> 38:01.245
is it's too hard.

38:01.270 --> 38:03.003
I... How is anybody
supposed to do it all?

38:03.028 --> 38:05.673
Nah, you'd be good at it.

38:05.698 --> 38:07.021
Why do you say that?

38:07.046 --> 38:08.679
I watched you.

38:08.704 --> 38:12.706
You're like that girl,
cagey, resourceful.

38:14.704 --> 38:17.326
You can't hack a real baby, Noah.

38:17.351 --> 38:19.563
Yeah, you're right, all right.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.610
And what do you mean, you watched me?

38:24.399 --> 38:25.828
You know.

38:37.227 --> 38:38.593
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:38.662 --> 38:40.261
I heard your dad's doing well.

38:40.330 --> 38:42.297
Yeah, I'm sure he's making
the nurses miserable.

38:42.365 --> 38:44.122
They can handle it.

38:46.269 --> 38:48.388
- I better get up there.
- Okay.

38:59.582 --> 39:01.049
We're waiting for a bed,

39:01.117 --> 39:03.384
then we'll transfer Troy upstairs.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.920
We're gonna get you feeling
better soon, okay, buddy?

39:05.989 --> 39:07.622
It takes a few weeks
to get back to normal,

39:07.691 --> 39:09.290
but his prognosis is good.

39:09.359 --> 39:11.439
He should have a full recovery.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.542
You waiting for a thank you?

39:20.370 --> 39:22.303
One of our social workers is
gonna come in and talk to you

39:22.372 --> 39:24.417
about nutrition, help
you with Troy's diet.

39:27.911 --> 39:29.566
And I'm sorry.

39:30.714 --> 39:34.848
I know it isn't easy
holding everything together.

39:35.066 --> 39:37.316
And, to tell you the truth,

39:38.287 --> 39:42.168
every day, I worry if I'm
doing right by my kid, so.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.090
Okay.

39:50.266 --> 39:51.606
Thanks.

39:56.005 --> 39:57.887
All right. Hang in there, champ.

40:04.814 --> 40:06.825
Hey, Pop, how you feeling?

40:07.974 --> 40:09.741
Like I took one on the chin.

40:09.766 --> 40:11.348
You kind of did.

40:12.122 --> 40:14.489
Maybe now, if something's
cooked in bacon grease,

40:14.557 --> 40:16.200
you'll think twice?

40:16.817 --> 40:19.694
You know, in fact,
we need to have a talk

40:19.763 --> 40:21.963
about all the junk food you eat.

40:22.031 --> 40:23.598
And the beer.

40:26.269 --> 40:28.836
What? I mean it.

40:28.905 --> 40:32.440
When we get home, there're
gonna be some changes.

40:54.063 --> 40:55.617
Thanks, kid.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.382
Yeah.

40:59.402 --> 41:00.859
I love you.

41:01.137 --> 41:02.523
Love you too.

41:23.226 --> 41:25.293
Who is that? Can you say hi?

41:25.361 --> 41:27.374
- Can you say hi?
- Hi.

41:27.931 --> 41:30.655
- Can you say hi?
- Yes, oh.
