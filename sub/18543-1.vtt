04:06.980 --> 04:09.039
That's fine. Thank you.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.188
May I come in, please?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.257
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.284
May I help you, sir?

04:22.395 --> 04:25.193
<i>- May I have change for 10?
- Yes. How would you like it?</i>

04:25.298 --> 04:27.198
Ten singles will be fine.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.345
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye now.</i>

05:14.781 --> 05:16.749
Coffee.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.883
I can get your pieces
by tomorrow night.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.886
I can get you probably six pieces.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.388
I got more now,
but I promised some of this lot.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.723
I don't know as I like that -

06:01.828 --> 06:04.319
buying from the same lot
as somebody else.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.333
- Makes me nervous.
- Yeah, well, I understand.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.891
You don't understand like I understand.
I got certain responsibilities.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.971
Look. I told you I understand.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.074
- Did you get my name or didn't you?
- I got your name.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.770
- Well, all right.
- All right nothin'.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.212
I wished I had a nickel
for every name I got that was all right.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.841
Look at that.
You know what that is?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.443
Your hand.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.081
I hope you look closer at those guns
than you did at that hand.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.955
- Look at your own goddamn hand.
- Yeah?

06:35.061 --> 06:38.656
- Count your fuckin' knuckles.
- All of 'em?

06:38.765 --> 06:42.826
Count as many as you want.
As many as you got, I got four more.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.665
You know how I got those?

06:45.772 --> 06:48.605
I bought some stuff from a man.
I knew his name.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.608
The stuff was traced.

06:50.710 --> 06:56.376
The guy I bought it for-
he's at MCI Walpole for 15 to 25. Still in there.

06:56.482 --> 07:00.646
But he had some friends.
I got an extra set of knuckles.

07:02.021 --> 07:04.387
They put your hand in a drawer...

07:04.490 --> 07:06.924
then somebody kicks the drawer shut.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.017
Hurt like a bastard.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.619
Jesus.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.666
What makes it hurt worse,
what makes it hurt more...

07:14.767 --> 07:16.928
is knowing what's gonna
happen to you, you know?

07:17.036 --> 07:20.437
There you are.
They just come up to you and say, "Look.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.508
"You made somebody mad.
You made a big mistake...

07:22.608 --> 07:24.542
"and now there's somebody
doing time for it.

07:24.644 --> 07:28.205
"There's nothing personal in it,
you understand, but it just has to be done.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.578
Now get your hand out there. "

07:30.683 --> 07:32.878
You think about not doing it, you know.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.988
When I was a kid in Sunday school,
this nun -

07:37.089 --> 07:38.989
she used to say, "Stick your hand out. "

07:39.091 --> 07:43.619
I stick my hand out - Whap! She'd knock me
across the knuckles with a steel-edge ruler.

07:43.729 --> 07:46.391
So one day I says,
when she told me, "Stick your hand out"...

07:46.499 --> 07:50.959
I says, "No. " She whapped me right across
the face with the ruler. Same thing.

07:52.071 --> 07:55.199
<i>They put your hand in a drawer.
Somebody kicks the drawer shut.</i>

07:55.308 --> 08:01.076
Ever hear bones breaking? Just like a man
snapping a shingle. Hurts like a bastard.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.876
I don't know who you been selling to...

08:03.983 --> 08:07.043
but The Man tells me you got guns
to sell, I need guns.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.088
Oh, look. You can't trace these guns.
I guarantee that.

08:10.189 --> 08:13.920
You better, or neither one of us
will be able to shake hands.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.153
Look. These guns are okay.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.560
They're new.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.065
Test firing's all they've had.
Brand-fuckin'- new.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.937
Air weight, shrouded hammers,
floating firing pins.

08:27.039 --> 08:30.031
I can get you four inches and two inches.
Just tell me what you want.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.609
<i>- How much?
- Eighty.</i>

08:32.712 --> 08:36.044
Eighty? You ever sell guns before?

08:36.148 --> 08:38.775
Look. I'm talking about 30 guns here.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.149
<i>What do you want, a discount?</i>

08:43.121 --> 08:46.580
I could sell 30 pieces tomorrow
without even seeing you.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.717
I can't get my hands on 'em fast enough.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.489
I'll bet if I was to go down the shrine there
and go to confession...

08:53.599 --> 08:56.227
I'd get three Hail Marys, and then
the priest would ask me confidentially...

08:56.335 --> 08:59.202
if I can get him something light
to carry underneath his coat.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.331
People are desperate for guns.
I had a guy ask me seriously the other day...

09:02.441 --> 09:05.308
- could I get him a few machine guns.
- What color was he?

09:05.411 --> 09:07.311
He was a nice guy.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.345
I never been able to understand
a man who wanted to use a machine gun.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.183
You get hooked with it, it's life.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.986
Your best all-around item
is the four-inch Smith.

09:20.092 --> 09:23.027
You can lift it,
she goes where you point it.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.529
<i>- I'll go 50.
- Oh, bullshit.</i>

09:26.566 --> 09:31.128
Look. I'm talking about
30 pieces. $1,500.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.439
Split the difference. Eighteen.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.608
I have to see the stuff.

09:37.710 --> 09:41.441
Sure. Okay.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.740
<i>Lines up the point.</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:52.516
Seen the Scal lately?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.889
Yeah, I see him. I don't see him.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.155
Coyle's been looking for him.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.061
Oh, yeah?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.067
- Say where he's at?
- At home.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.243
<i>Collins almost breaks it up against the-</i>

10:18.351 --> 10:20.546
<i>Kicks off to -</i>

10:20.653 --> 10:24.783
Three, eight, four-

10:31.497 --> 10:34.364
Hello, Eddie?
Yeah, it's me, Artie.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.402
Look, I gotta talk to ya.
Could I meet ya?

10:37.503 --> 10:39.733
Listen.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.535
You wanna see this through, right?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.701
<i>I'll be here at Dillon's.</i>

10:45.745 --> 10:47.679
Okay.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.559
It's a good thing you told me
you got a new car.

12:08.661 --> 12:12.563
I wouldn't have figured you for this.
What happened to the 396?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.565
Bills were eating me up.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.433
It went like a bird
with a flame up its ass though.

12:19.939 --> 12:23.841
I can't swing it anymore. I'm gonna have to
get married and settle down.

12:23.943 --> 12:27.242
- I mean, I just can't swing it anymore.
- Come on. You do okay off of me.

12:27.346 --> 12:30.975
Shit. What'd I get off you
in the last six months?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.574
3,700? That went easy.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.651
I can't hack around anymore, man.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.784
I mean, if I don't stop this, I'm gonna be
looking at the outside from the inside.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.062
How about you?
You still riding?

12:45.164 --> 12:47.132
Nah. That was before I heard
about making money.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.224
Okay. Come on.
You got the stuff?

12:50.536 --> 12:53.334
Yeah.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.407
Mostly four inches though.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.202
- 480, right?
- How come "right"?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.247
Four inches?

13:03.349 --> 13:06.614
Six months ago you'd moan
if I bring you anything but two inches.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.880
I got a better class of trade now.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.047
What, are you hooked in
with the Mafia or something?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.651
I'll tell you the truth -
I don't know.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.752
There's this heavyset guy, you know.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.831
Looks like a mick.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.730
Says he'll take anything I can deliver.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.326
I never seen such demand
for guns before.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.905
Four inches, six inches, uh, Mags...

13:28.007 --> 13:30.567
uh,.41s,.45s,.44s.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.576
You name it.

13:32.678 --> 13:35.647
He just keeps bringing me the bread.
It's okay with me.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.648
You do all right off me.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.412
Come on. I give you 20 apiece for iron.
That costs you nothing.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.953
You do all right.

13:43.055 --> 13:44.955
You do better.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.084
Don't hassle me, man.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.560
Look. I know what you're dumping
the money on. I know, all right.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.362
But as long as you can function,
that's okay with me.

13:57.403 --> 14:02.204
But you get my ass in the gears, man,
and I'm gonna turn the flame up under yours.

14:02.308 --> 14:06.074
Come on. I'll see you next week, all right?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.234
<i>You're not looking too good.</i>

15:03.335 --> 15:05.826
I'm looking at three to five, it seems like.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.906
What about the appeal?

15:08.007 --> 15:12.000
Lost the appeal.
Lost the motion for reconsideration.

15:12.111 --> 15:15.808
Gotta surrender up there
for execution of sentence in a week or two.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.713
Shit.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.118
The old lady's gotta go on welfare.

15:22.221 --> 15:26.055
How would you like that? Your wife and kids
have to go on welfare, like niggers.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.126
Dillon, you gotta do something for me.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.627
<i>- I do what I can.
- I stood up.</i>

15:30.729 --> 15:33.630
You're a stand-up guy.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.257
Christ, I wish I never did that job for ya.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.531
<i>I wish it never happened.
But that don't help.</i>

15:39.638 --> 15:43.335
It looked like a pipe.
You know that. You told me yourself.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.933
You told me you needed dough.
You got the money up front.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.349
Yeah.

16:26.352 --> 16:30.789
The whole town's buttoned up
on this, uh, grand jury anyway.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.380
I never seen things so quiet.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.722
There's nothing much going on.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.594
You guys must have
taken up circle jerks or somethin'.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.600
They ought to run one of these
grand juries every three weeks or so.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.068
It sure puts you guys in the closet.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.071
Fuck you.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.300
By the end of the week,
Artie Van's gonna be...

16:50.409 --> 16:52.639
selling papers
or shining shoes or somethin'.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.272
- He oughta get unemployment.
- Cut it out.

16:56.382 --> 16:59.818
All right.
That was a cheap shot. I apologize.

16:59.918 --> 17:03.513
<i>But there isn't anything going on.</i>

17:03.622 --> 17:05.817
There's something goin' on.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.983
A bunch of the boys getting together,
watch dirty movies?

17:09.094 --> 17:11.221
Hmm.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.525
To tell you the truth -

17:13.632 --> 17:15.964
I don't know what it is.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.434
People are trying to sort of avoid me.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.436
You know?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.473
Guys telephoning
for guys that aren't there.

17:26.744 --> 17:29.111
Here's 20.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.307
Who's calling up?

17:31.417 --> 17:33.317
Remember Eddie Fingers?

17:33.419 --> 17:35.478
Fella that got his hand busted up.

17:35.587 --> 17:38.954
- Who's he looking for?
- Jimmy Scalise. Do you know him?

17:39.058 --> 17:42.050
Last time I heard he was in Florida,
getting some sun.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.061
- Does he find him?
- I don't know.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.961
- I'm just a messenger boy.
- They give you numbers.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.034
Telephone numbers.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.329
I'm a law-abiding citizen.
I got a liquor license.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.600
Ah, you work for a guy
that's got a liquor license. Ever see him?

17:54.706 --> 17:56.674
You're a convicted felon.

17:57.776 --> 18:02.110
Like I say, I work for a guy
got a liquor license. I forget sometimes.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.012
- Want to forget this?
- I'd just as soon.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.686
You ought to get yourself a car.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.846
I don't drive.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.948
If I could afford a car,
I wouldn't be taking 20 a week from you.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.027
Have a nice day.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.068
<i>Mr. Partridge.</i>

18:32.177 --> 18:37.012
We are going to your bank.
You and I and my friend.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.916
My other friend will stay here
with your wife and children...

18:41.019 --> 18:43.351
to make sure nothing happens to them.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.855
Nothing will happen to them,
and nothing will happen to you...

18:45.958 --> 18:47.516
<i>if you do what I tell you.</i>

18:47.626 --> 18:51.392
<i>If you don't,
at least one of them will be shot.</i>

18:51.497 --> 18:53.397
<i>Understand?</i>

18:53.499 --> 18:55.399
I understand.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.469
Here's your coat.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.730
We leave by the back door.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.677
Everything will be all right.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.906
- Don't be afraid.
- Okay.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.710
Now, you do what
your mommy tells you.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.855
It'll be all right.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.622
They don't want to hurt us.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.498
<i>- All they want is the money.
- He's right.</i>

19:27.599 --> 19:30.363
We don't get any kicks
from hurting people.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.937
Nobody does anything silly...

19:33.038 --> 19:35.006
nobody gets hurt.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.309
Give him your car keys.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.510
<i>Let's go to the bank, Mr. Partridge.</i>

20:01.967 --> 20:03.867
You sleep late, Mr. Partridge.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.563
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.607
You're probably a brave man.
Don't try to prove it.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.268
We don't plan to hurt you
or anyone else...

20:12.377 --> 20:14.402
unless you make us,
or somebody fucks up.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.182
Now, sit down on the floor of the car.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.289
Go.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.765
I'm going to take off your blindfold,
Mr. Partridge...

21:12.871 --> 21:14.839
and then you get sitting up.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.204
Mr. Partridge...

21:21.313 --> 21:24.043
do you see the man
in that phone booth?

21:24.149 --> 21:26.117
<i>Yes.</i>

21:26.218 --> 21:30.314
<i>When he gives me the signal, I'll know he's
made contact with our friend at your home.</i>

21:30.422 --> 21:33.289
You will then walk to
the front door of your bank...

21:33.392 --> 21:35.326
ring the bell in the usual way...

21:35.427 --> 21:38.624
go into the bank
and tell your people what's going on.

21:38.730 --> 21:42.029
Then you will open
the back door and let us in.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.468
If that door is not open in exactly
one minute after you've entered the bank...

21:46.571 --> 21:48.505
you know what will happen
to your family...

21:48.607 --> 21:52.202
and we will leave immediately
in a car you've never seen.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.077
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.596
Okay. Go ahead.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.764
Back up so we can see the door.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.157
Stay right where you are.
Don't press no buttons.

24:24.262 --> 24:26.992
Calm down. Keep quiet.
No one will get hurt.

24:58.029 --> 25:01.157
Hey. Open the door.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.744
Come on. Come on.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.908
Tell 'em to sit down on the floor
in front of the desk.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.984
Please sit down on the floor.

25:25.891 --> 25:28.189
Tell 'em the rest.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.727
When the time lock on the vault opens...

25:30.829 --> 25:32.956
these men will take
what they came for.

25:33.064 --> 25:36.431
I will leave with them.
We will return to my house.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.435
Keep on.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.370
There is another man
at my house with my family.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.600
<i>They will pick him up and leave.</i>

25:43.708 --> 25:47.041
<i>This man has told me
no one will be hurt if no one interferes.</i>

25:47.145 --> 25:49.477
I have to believe him.
So, everyone, please cooperate...

25:49.581 --> 25:51.606
and don't set off any alarms.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.655
What time does it open?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.728
8:48.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.023
When the fuck does it open?

26:47.872 --> 26:50.432
- That's it.
- Open it.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.340
When you get it open,
move towards the desk there...

26:57.449 --> 27:00.316
so I can watch you and the rest
of them at the same time.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.888
<i>You and I are going to go out and get in
a car and go. Tell them what to do.</i>

28:23.535 --> 28:25.628
When these men leave...

28:25.737 --> 28:27.967
get up and take your usual places.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.042
<i>Open the doors. Draw the curtains.</i>

28:31.142 --> 28:35.579
<i>Start to do business.
You've got to give these men at least an hour.</i>

28:36.681 --> 28:39.377
For God sakes, give them the time.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.614
Okay. Let's go.

29:16.888 --> 29:19.982
Put your hands on the seat
and get yourself sitting up.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.466
Come on.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.867
I'm going to point you,
and you'll start walking.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.370
You'll hear me get back in the car.
You just keep walkin'.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.940
'Cause I've got the windows down
and the guns on you.

29:37.041 --> 29:41.137
Count to 100 very slowly.
That's when you'll be safe.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.214
Start walkin', Mr. Partridge.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.678
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye-bye.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.750
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.469
You say anything
to those kids this mornin'?

31:22.580 --> 31:24.912
About what?

31:25.016 --> 31:26.984
<i>About that trouble up there.</i>

31:27.085 --> 31:29.576
Not at all. Why would I?

31:31.623 --> 31:33.818
Why?

31:33.925 --> 31:36.655
Well, I thought they acted
kind of funny toward me this mornin'.

31:36.761 --> 31:39.423
Oh. It's your imagination.

31:41.432 --> 31:44.230
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Nothin'.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.005
I gotta go somewhere today,
see a fella.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.835
Goddamn lawyer of mine.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.073
That harpy's got oatmeal for brains.

31:59.517 --> 32:02.748
If I had time, I'd get somebody
to draw up some papers for me.

32:02.854 --> 32:06.085
You know. Incompetence of counsel.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.283
Wouldn't let me take the stand.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.921
I know a fella who can do that,
but he's in the bucket.

32:12.964 --> 32:16.559
My mother said she'd move in
and take care of the kids, while I work.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.570
Work?

32:19.671 --> 32:21.935
What are you talking about, work?

32:22.040 --> 32:24.099
You don't want us
to go on welfare, do you?

32:24.208 --> 32:29.544
Hey, look. Sheila, look. It's gonna be
all right up there in New Hampshire.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.707
The fella I'm seeing today-
he told me he could square it for me.

32:32.817 --> 32:35.945
Then we'll get the hell out of here, okay?

32:36.054 --> 32:38.045
I'm not complaining.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.691
Eddie.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.727
Eddie!

32:44.762 --> 32:48.220
It's morning!

33:21.399 --> 33:23.299
That's a nice machine you got there.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.562
- Anybody I know?
- I don't think so.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.901
Fella out in the western part of the state
was using it to transport moon.

33:29.007 --> 33:33.000
The poor bastard. Paid cash for it,
got hooked on his first trip.

33:33.111 --> 33:36.046
Well, they get away with it sometimes.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.615
- I didn't know that was in your line.
- It isn't.

33:38.716 --> 33:41.014
But, you know, you hear different things.

33:41.119 --> 33:44.987
- People get careless.
- I know.

33:45.089 --> 33:48.490
Like last week I heard you were
coming up for sentencing in New Hampshire.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.721
I thought you might
like to go up there with me for the weekend.

33:51.829 --> 33:55.890
You're, uh, still interested
in machine guns, I suppose.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.900
Oh, yes, indeed.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.402
I've always had a strong interest
in a machine gun or two.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.405
That's what I said.

34:02.507 --> 34:05.965
I said old Foley's reliable.
Never forgets his old friends.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.237
Just what old friends, for example?

34:08.346 --> 34:12.282
Well, I was thinking, for example, that, uh,
U.S. Attorney up in New Hampshire there.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.578
You thought I might enjoy
a chance to talk to him?

34:14.685 --> 34:17.051
<i>Well, I figure it's worth tryin'.</i>

34:17.155 --> 34:19.214
Well, it's a long way to go.

34:19.322 --> 34:21.587
Still, if I had a strong reason.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.717
Well, I got three kids and a wife at home there.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.728
I just can't do any more time.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.460
You know, the kids are growing up. They go
to school, all the other kids laugh at 'em.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.400
Well, hell, I'm almost 51 years old.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.701
That's your strong reason.
I need one for me.

34:38.141 --> 34:41.839
What are they holding over you?
About five years?

34:41.946 --> 34:43.914
My lawyer figures about two.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.279
Oh, you'd do well to get out with two.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.478
You had about 200 cases
of Canadian Club on that truck...

34:49.587 --> 34:52.248
the way I remember it,
and none of it belonged to you.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.347
I keep telling you it was a mistake.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.518
<i>Well, you made that mistake before.</i>

34:56.627 --> 35:01.064
Look. There I am, minding my own business,
getting along the best I could.

35:01.165 --> 35:05.067
A man calls me up, knows I'm out of work,
asked me if I'd drive a truck for him.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.433
I didn't know that man from Burlington
from Adam.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.665
Yeah, I can see how that would happen.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.708
A man like you, lives in Quincy, Mass...

35:11.809 --> 35:15.074
must get a lot of calls to drive a semi
from Burlington to Portland.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.079
I'm surprised the jury didn't believe you.

35:17.181 --> 35:20.378
Ah, that dopey lawyer of mine
wouldn't let me take the stand.

35:20.485 --> 35:24.285
Anyway, I was wondering if maybe
there wasn't some way we could handle it.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.322
Like me saying hello to somebody?

35:26.424 --> 35:29.655
Well, I was thinking a little stronger than that.
I was thinking in terms of, uh...

35:29.760 --> 35:33.321
maybe you talking to the prosecutor up there
and having them drop a word to the judge...

35:33.431 --> 35:35.661
how I been helping my uncle
like a bastard.

35:35.766 --> 35:39.702
Well, I would,
but then again, you haven't been.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.772
What? I gave you a couple of calls.

35:41.873 --> 35:45.206
Yeah. You give me some real stuff too.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.608
You tell me about a guy that's gonna get hit.
Fifteen minutes later, he gets hit.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.613
You tell me about some guys and a job...

35:50.715 --> 35:54.082
but you don't tell me till they're
coming out the door with the money.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.915
That's not helping Uncle, Eddie.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.251
You gotta put your whole soul into it.

36:00.625 --> 36:04.026
Hell, the way I hear it, you're maybe mixed up
in something that's going on.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.993
<i>- Like what?
- Oh, well.</i>

36:06.097 --> 36:08.827
I wouldn't want to confront a man
with something I heard.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.834
You know me better than that.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.904
Well, uh...

36:14.005 --> 36:16.565
suppose we was
to talk about machine guns?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.801
Just to change the subject?

36:18.910 --> 36:22.209
Well, suppose someone should put you onto
somebody who was selling machine guns.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.304
You wouldn't want him
to go to jail, would ya?

36:24.415 --> 36:26.610
Somebody who was helping you
like that, you wouldn't want him...

36:26.717 --> 36:29.151
to go to jail and embarrass
his kids and all, would ya?

36:29.253 --> 36:31.153
When's it supposed to come off?

36:31.255 --> 36:33.223
How much you interested?

36:35.927 --> 36:38.487
Let me put it this way.

36:38.596 --> 36:42.657
If I was to get my hands on some machine
guns and the fella that was selling 'em...

36:42.767 --> 36:45.361
and whoever's buying 'em...

36:45.469 --> 36:49.530
I wouldn't mind saying to someone else
that somebody was helping Uncle.

36:50.608 --> 36:52.508
Now, you need anything else?

36:52.610 --> 36:54.635
I need a good leavin' alone.
That's what I need.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.339
I don't want nobody following me around.

36:57.448 --> 37:00.884
Okay. We'll do it your way.

37:00.985 --> 37:03.749
You call me when you get something,
if you do.

37:03.854 --> 37:07.722
And if I get somethin',
I'll put it in front of the U.S. Attorney.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.663
If I don't, all bets are off.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.898
Understood?

37:16.934 --> 37:18.902
Have a nice day.

37:20.705 --> 37:23.902
<i>You remember Eddie Fingers? Eddie Coyle?</i>

37:24.008 --> 37:25.942
<i>The bank robber. The one from Natick.</i>

37:26.043 --> 37:29.740
Nah, that's his sidekick, Artie Van.
Eddie doesn't rob banks.

37:29.847 --> 37:33.806
They branch out.
What about him?

37:33.918 --> 37:36.546
I got this call from Coyle,
so I went out to see him.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.554
What'd he want?

37:38.656 --> 37:40.783
He's coming up for sentencing
in New Hampshire.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.257
Wants some references.
What's he got to trade?

37:43.361 --> 37:47.525
He was offering to peddle me
this guy with machine guns.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.261
That bastard.
He's about this high in the bunch...

37:51.369 --> 37:53.735
but he gets around
more than any man I've ever seen.

37:53.838 --> 37:57.899
One day he's here, the next day he's there.
You'd think he was some fuckin' stray dog.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.876
I just wish I had a line on half
of what he was doin'.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.878
Does he work anywhere?

38:03.914 --> 38:07.350
Ah. He's a night expediter
over at Arliss Trucking.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.978
But you just try to find him there.
He works about as much as Santa Claus.

38:13.090 --> 38:16.355
My friend says Coyle's been
trying to look for, uh, Scalise.

38:17.561 --> 38:21.554
My friend runs a saloon.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.964
And I know he's got an undisclosed interest.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.866
And he knows I know.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.304
<i>A strange guy.</i>

38:30.408 --> 38:33.900
What do you hear about, uh,
Artie Van and Scalise?

38:34.011 --> 38:36.536
Nothing together, no.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.775
I wonder. Uh, you don't suppose
that Artie and, uh, Scalise...

38:39.884 --> 38:42.318
made that withdrawal
from the bank, do you?

38:42.420 --> 38:45.218
It's a thought.
I wonder where Eddie fits in.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.884
<i>Well, he's arming some wiseguys.
He's done it before.</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:50.893
That friend of yours
that runs the saloon -

38:50.995 --> 38:53.896
<i>is that the same saloon we talked about
putting a wire in a few weeks back?</i>

38:53.998 --> 38:56.057
- That's the one.
- Okay. You write it up...

38:56.167 --> 38:58.067
and I'll present it to the attorney.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.069
Maybe we ought to
talk about it some more.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.162
It's not gonna do you
any good in your head.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.731
- You wanted a wiretap. - By the time I get
it written up, it'll all be over with.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.903
Well, that's what you get
when you get to be an expert, kid.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.811
Or, uh, maybe you'd rather
go back to the pussy posse?

40:04.201 --> 40:06.169
<i>Hey! You, man!</i>

40:08.706 --> 40:10.731
Are you selling somethin'?

40:12.209 --> 40:14.643
<i>- That depends.
- Wait a minute.</i>

40:26.590 --> 40:29.081
Are you the guy?

40:30.728 --> 40:32.628
No, I'm a narc.

40:32.730 --> 40:36.291
Don't - Don't hassle me, man.
Are you the guy we're looking for?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.425
It depends.

40:39.703 --> 40:42.103
Depends upon what you're looking to do.

40:42.206 --> 40:44.174
Wait a minute.

40:48.045 --> 40:51.481
I don't know what he is.
He might be a narc. I don't know what he is.

40:51.582 --> 40:54.380
<i>- Ask him to come to the back door.
- Sure, I'll ask him.</i>

40:54.485 --> 40:56.851
Hey, uh, come to the back door.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.653
<i>- Is he comin'?
- No, he ain't doin' nothin'.</i>

41:10.868 --> 41:13.701
- Who the fuck are you?
- Cool it, man. This is Andrea.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.704
I don't give a shit who she is.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.740
<i>Look. I understood there was
gonna be somebody here...</i>

41:17.842 --> 41:19.537
that wanted to do some business.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.543
- How do we know who you are?
- You don't.

41:21.645 --> 41:25.581
- Yeah, you could be a cop.
- I could be J. Edgar Hoover. Now, what the hell do you want?

41:27.518 --> 41:30.043
We understood you could get us
some machine guns.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.319
Hey, look. You - You want to burn
your fuckin' bra, all right...

41:35.426 --> 41:37.451
<i>but what you gonna do
with a machine gun?</i>

41:37.561 --> 41:40.655
We're gonna rob a fuckin' bank.

41:50.908 --> 41:53.502
I can get you five
machine guns by Friday.

41:53.611 --> 41:57.377
M16s. $350 apiece.
You want ammo, it's extra.

41:57.481 --> 42:01.144
How much extra?
$250 for 500 rounds.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.152
That's $2,000.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.154
I make that.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.715
Be here Friday night with the stuff.

42:08.826 --> 42:12.660
Half now. A grand in advance.
Machine guns are a hot item.

42:12.763 --> 42:15.493
I don't like that.

42:15.599 --> 42:18.193
I don't give a good damn
what you like.

42:21.205 --> 42:25.198
Look, I got two problems
selling machine guns to people like you.

42:25.309 --> 42:28.301
The first is selling machine guns.
That's life in this state.

42:29.914 --> 42:32.712
The second is selling to people like you.
You're not honest.

42:32.816 --> 42:36.775
You know where I'm gonna be and what
time, I'm liable to lose my machine guns.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.083
Give him a thousand dollars, Pete.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.464
You show up with no money...

42:51.569 --> 42:53.469
no guns.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.835
And keep this in mind:

42:55.940 --> 42:58.101
I got more than five machine guns...

42:58.208 --> 43:01.200
and the rest are gonna be
pointed at you.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.770
Bastard. Fucking bastard.

43:04.882 --> 43:07.316
Life's hard, lover.
Life's very hard.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.753
Why the hell didn't you wake me up?

43:12.856 --> 43:16.383
Yesterday I got you up, and you
gave me hell for not letting you sleep.

43:16.493 --> 43:19.690
Today I let you sleep, and now you're
giving me hell for not getting you up.

43:19.797 --> 43:22.288
Well, I gotta make some calls.

43:22.399 --> 43:24.765
I know. I know.

43:24.868 --> 43:28.065
"Go upstairs.
I have to make some calls. "

43:28.172 --> 43:31.198
You know, sometimes I think I'm married
to the president or something.

43:31.308 --> 43:33.435
It won't take long.
I just gotta do this.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.842
Call the president.
Call the pope.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.854
<i>Barry, check aisle seven.</i>

43:51.695 --> 43:53.959
Hey.

43:54.064 --> 43:57.932
You owe me 10 more guns.
I need 'em fast. When do I get 'em?

43:58.035 --> 43:59.935
I don't know.

44:00.037 --> 44:03.473
Look. I got you the first batch when I said,
and I was ahead on the dozen.

44:03.574 --> 44:06.407
- You know, these things take time.
- Time is what I haven't got.

44:06.510 --> 44:09.741
I'm getting pressure. I gotta see The Man
tomorrow night. I need those guns.

44:09.847 --> 44:11.747
I can't get 'em for you by tomorrow night.

44:11.849 --> 44:14.181
Son of a bitch.
I gotta have that stuff fast.

44:14.284 --> 44:18.186
I got a long ride to make tomorrow night.
Maybe you can stop with me when I make it.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.416
No way.
No way, no day, no can do.

44:21.525 --> 44:24.016
Look. I told you. I get quality.
These things take time.

44:24.128 --> 44:26.722
Tomorrow night.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.390
You aren't buyin' a loaf of bread,
you know.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.526
I got a thing set up that works pretty good.

44:32.636 --> 44:35.332
Dependable stuff that's not
gonna get anybody in trouble.

44:35.439 --> 44:38.067
I'm not gonna screw it up just because
your people got hot drawers.

44:38.175 --> 44:41.440
- You'll have to tell 'em that.
- You tell 'em.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.778
Look. The stuff'll come.
What's the big emergency?

44:49.219 --> 44:54.623
Look. One of the first things I learned
is never to ask a man why he's in a hurry.

44:54.725 --> 44:58.183
All you got to know is I told a man
that he could depend on me...

44:58.295 --> 45:00.763
because you told me
I could depend on you.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.856
Now, one of us is gonna have
a big, fat problem.

45:03.967 --> 45:05.867
Another thing I learned.

45:05.969 --> 45:09.461
If anybody's gonna have a problem,
you're gonna be the one.

45:09.573 --> 45:12.269
- You finished?
- No, I am not finished.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.971
Look, I'm gettin' old. You hear?

45:16.080 --> 45:18.640
I spend most of my life
hanging around crummy joints...

45:18.749 --> 45:22.116
with a bunch of punks, drinking their beer,
eating the hash and the hot dogs...

45:22.219 --> 45:24.312
and watching the other people
go off to Florida...

45:24.421 --> 45:27.720
while I'm sweatin' out
how I'm gonna pay the plumber.

45:27.825 --> 45:32.023
I done time when I stood up,
but I can't take no more chances.

45:32.129 --> 45:35.098
Next time, it's gonna be me
going to Florida.

45:35.199 --> 45:38.168
Now you listen.
You're still a kid.

45:38.268 --> 45:42.364
Then you come out, and you go around
and say, "Look, I'm a man.

45:42.473 --> 45:45.271
"You can take what I say,
and it happens.

45:45.375 --> 45:48.310
I go through. "

45:48.412 --> 45:50.471
Well, you're learning
something too, my friend...

45:50.581 --> 45:53.379
and I advise you to learn it right now.

45:53.484 --> 45:56.419
When you say that,
when you get me out there all by myself...

45:56.520 --> 45:59.114
on what you say,
you better be right there in back of me...

45:59.223 --> 46:02.454
because when you say it happens,
it's gonna fuckin' happen.

46:02.559 --> 46:05.995
- If it don't, you got your thing caught in the zipper.
- Now, just -

46:06.096 --> 46:08.724
Now, I don't want any talk from you
and any shit from you.

46:08.832 --> 46:10.959
I want 10 guns.
I want 'em tomorrow night.

46:11.068 --> 46:14.003
I'll be right there with the money.
Same place where we were before.

46:14.104 --> 46:17.073
I'll be there with the money.
You be there with those goddamn guns...

46:17.174 --> 46:19.074
because if you ain't...

46:19.176 --> 46:21.667
I'll be lookin' for ya,
and I'll find ya too.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.213
Because I ain't the only one
that's gonna be lookin' for ya...

46:24.314 --> 46:26.646
and we know how to find people.

46:31.522 --> 46:33.422
All right. Uh -

46:33.524 --> 46:37.085
Look. I have to go to Rhode Island
tonight, and I'm gonna be back late.

46:37.194 --> 46:40.254
Then I gotta see some people
late tomorrow afternoon.

46:41.698 --> 46:45.361
C- Can I meet you someplace early where
I can get free by, let's say, uh, uh, 3:00?

46:45.469 --> 46:48.336
'Cause listen, man. You're coming up
faster than we said, you know...

46:48.438 --> 46:51.168
and - and I got other people to see too.

46:51.275 --> 46:53.209
Tomorrow afternoon's okay?

46:53.310 --> 46:55.778
Yeah.

46:55.879 --> 46:57.779
Look. Have the money, huh?
Uh...

46:57.881 --> 47:00.145
if I work this fast,
I'm gonna need the money fast.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.684
No sweat. I'll have the money.
No sweat.

47:06.290 --> 47:08.224
You better kick it along, huh?

47:09.426 --> 47:13.624
Listen. I've been on the road
all fuckin' day, one thing or another...

47:13.730 --> 47:16.426
and by the time I get home tonight,
it's gonna be morning.

47:16.533 --> 47:18.763
So just stay off of my ass, huh?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.999
I always wanted to see how much
one of these things could do.

47:23.106 --> 47:25.006
You get the Magnum mill?

47:25.108 --> 47:27.838
No, I got the Hemi.
383 Hemi.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.241
You can have one too, you know.

47:32.349 --> 47:37.616
Just get me, say, another, uh,
25, 30 of those M16s.

47:57.407 --> 47:59.307
Where the fuck you taking me?

47:59.409 --> 48:02.674
Take a left. You go a hundred yards
or so, there's a clearing.

48:02.779 --> 48:04.747
They're all there.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.557
You gotta go up the hill.

48:15.659 --> 48:17.593
Get out.

48:17.694 --> 48:20.219
No. Go up the hill.

48:21.331 --> 48:23.799
I said get out.

48:44.087 --> 48:48.319
Now you go up there,
and you get your friends and the rifles...

48:48.425 --> 48:50.450
and you come back down here
and we'll do business.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.926
<i>- Here. Not there.
- Why?</i>

48:53.030 --> 48:54.930
<i>Because I think you need the exercise.</i>

48:55.032 --> 48:57.523
<i>'Cause I like the moonlight.</i>

48:57.634 --> 49:01.001
And 'cause I'm not so fuckin' stupid
as to drive this car into the woods...

49:01.104 --> 49:04.767
to find two other guys with machine guns
who know I got money.

49:04.875 --> 49:08.504
This life's hard, man,
but it's harder if you're stupid.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.308
<i>Now go up there, and I'll stay down here,
and I'm gonna be watchin'.</i>

49:11.415 --> 49:14.646
<i>When you get down here,
I'll tell you what to do next. Now move.</i>

49:57.461 --> 50:00.157
I don't know. I can't see.

50:00.263 --> 50:01.890
<i>Hmm.</i>

50:01.999 --> 50:04.661
Plenty cold out here.
Been waiting a long time.

50:04.768 --> 50:05.826
<i>Shh.</i>

50:09.506 --> 50:11.770
That's it! Far enough!

50:13.377 --> 50:17.541
<i>You two there hand the rifles
to the kid that was with me.</i>

50:17.647 --> 50:20.377
Then stand still.

50:28.658 --> 50:30.956
Now get your ass down here.

51:01.625 --> 51:04.958
<i>Put the rifles in the trunk
and shut it.</i>

51:14.438 --> 51:17.464
Shut the goddamn trunk.
Hold it!

51:17.574 --> 51:19.565
<i>I got a. 45 on ya.</i>

51:20.877 --> 51:22.777
Now, where's the ammo?

51:24.648 --> 51:27.617
Uh, yeah, we couldn't get no ammo.

51:27.717 --> 51:30.618
You can steal the goddamn guns
out of the stores...

51:30.720 --> 51:33.120
but you can't get any bullets?

51:33.223 --> 51:35.316
Look, we'll get it for you.
Honest.

51:35.425 --> 51:39.828
The kid who was supposed to get it got sick.
He wasn't on duty when it came up.

51:39.930 --> 51:42.421
<i>We're not gonna trust
just anybody, you know.</i>

51:42.532 --> 51:44.329
All right.

51:45.602 --> 51:48.503
I'm gonna be nice to ya.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.505
I really oughta
keep some of this back...

51:50.607 --> 51:53.576
for you putting me in the ditch
with the ammo, but -

51:55.112 --> 51:58.013
Fuck it.
My problem is, I'm a nice guy.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.743
When you get that stuff, you call me.
You hear?

52:00.851 --> 52:03.046
Yeah, okay, Thanks, huh?

52:03.153 --> 52:05.121
Thanks a lot.

52:06.690 --> 52:09.659
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

52:26.143 --> 52:28.043
- Come in, Nancy.
- Vern.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.545
- Stay cool. We're being robbed.
- You're kidding me.

52:30.647 --> 52:32.672
- No.
- They're really here?

52:33.717 --> 52:36.242
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Get to work, sweetie.</i>

52:36.353 --> 52:38.583
You too, lover.

52:43.260 --> 52:46.127
Nice piece of ass.
You ripping off some of that?

52:46.229 --> 52:50.063
Oh, just get the hell over there.
I don't care what the hell you're doing.

54:24.694 --> 54:27.094
May I have your attention?

54:27.197 --> 54:32.601
<i>I want to remind you not to attempt
anything courageous or foolish.</i>

54:32.702 --> 54:34.602
<i>It would come to the same thing.</i>

54:34.704 --> 54:39.471
<i>I want you to remember that these men
have someone at my house...</i>

54:39.576 --> 54:43.478
<i>and they say he'll kill my wife
if anything goes wrong.</i>

54:43.580 --> 54:45.480
<i>I believe them.</i>

54:45.582 --> 54:48.278
<i>It's not at all unusual.</i>

54:48.385 --> 54:51.513
I've been held up four times
in 36 years...

54:51.621 --> 54:54.784
<i>and I can tell you
the important thing is not to panic...</i>

54:54.891 --> 54:57.724
<i>and not to try to resist.</i>

54:57.827 --> 54:59.954
<i>That's right. No one will get hurt.</i>

55:00.063 --> 55:02.861
Keep the shades drawn until 9:15.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.332
Then let the people in.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.198
<i>Tell 'em the rest, quick.</i>

55:07.304 --> 55:09.670
<i>If anyone wants a large amount of currency...</i>

55:09.773 --> 55:12.037
<i>tell them the time lock is stuck...</i>

55:12.142 --> 55:14.702
and I've gone to get assistance.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.837
- Is that clear?
- Okay, let's go.

55:32.696 --> 55:35.824
<i>What did you do?
I said, what did you do?</i>

55:35.932 --> 55:39.026
- Nothing. Honest, I -
- You hit the alarm! I told you not to, and you did it!

55:41.271 --> 55:43.239
The rest of you, get in the vault!

55:44.274 --> 55:47.266
Get in the goddamn vault!

55:47.377 --> 55:49.402
Get in the fuckin' vault!

56:07.163 --> 56:09.631
Jesus! For Christ's sake, bingo!

57:12.061 --> 57:14.325
Christ, Artie, what happened?

57:14.431 --> 57:18.128
Ah, somebody got stupid,
and somebody got nervous and shot him.

57:18.234 --> 57:22.102
- Jesus.
- Ah, that's the way it goes.

57:22.205 --> 57:24.867
They'll have everybody there -
the F.B.I., everybody.

57:24.974 --> 57:29.172
Not on that bank. No federal insurance.
S.P. Only. We're okay.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.247
I don't know.
Geez, I don't know.

57:32.649 --> 57:35.618
- When do you have to see The Man?
- In a while.

57:35.718 --> 57:37.686
Okay.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.426
<i>Make sure it's right.</i>

57:44.461 --> 57:46.622
You guys gonna go again?

57:46.729 --> 57:49.289
Well, we talked about it.
We can make one more move.

57:49.399 --> 57:51.333
Oh, geez, I don't know about that.

57:51.434 --> 57:53.527
You just get the guns.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.831
Next week, I'm goin' south.

57:55.939 --> 57:57.839
Get some caramel candy.

57:57.941 --> 57:59.841
Fuck you.
You know where I'm goin'.

57:59.943 --> 58:02.002
Hey, I tried to tell you,
but you didn't listen.

58:02.111 --> 58:04.978
- Looked like a pipe, Artie.
- You didn't listen.

58:05.081 --> 58:08.448
You wanna set up a hit,
then Dillon's your man.

58:08.551 --> 58:11.384
But he was eight minutes behind
in that truck.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.854
Ah, it's too late now.

58:13.957 --> 58:16.118
Yeah, it looks like it.

58:16.226 --> 58:19.127
Hey, you just get the guns to Scal.

58:19.229 --> 58:21.197
Yeah.

58:24.133 --> 58:26.829
There's this truck.
It bothers me.

58:26.936 --> 58:30.337
I know it sounds funny because I suppose
you would think that what would be worrying me...

58:30.440 --> 58:32.340
would be the guys in the truck...

58:32.442 --> 58:35.934
or maybe some guy I don't even know
watching me pretty close in the bar or something.

58:36.045 --> 58:38.707
But I have seen the truck.

58:38.815 --> 58:41.477
Put two guys in that truck,
they could get the pope.

58:41.584 --> 58:44.485
The only time I see an engine like that
is in a Cadillac.

58:44.587 --> 58:48.921
So you know you aren't gonna run away
'cause that thing's gonna run right away with ya.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.425
In the windshield they got
a crack on the passenger side.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.929
You open it right up,
you stick a deer rifle out there.

58:55.031 --> 58:57.625
Now you're on the Mystic Bridge,
that thing wheels up behind ya...

58:57.734 --> 59:00.794
the windshield's opening up and I ask ya,
what are you gonna do now?

59:00.904 --> 59:04.203
You're gonna make a good Act of Contrition
is what you're gonna do.

59:04.307 --> 59:06.969
I mean, sure, I don't drive.

59:07.076 --> 59:11.775
The only time I'm on that bridge
is coming home from the track on the bus.

59:11.881 --> 59:14.179
Do you see what I'm gettin' at?

59:15.585 --> 59:17.849
I know these guys.

59:17.954 --> 59:20.582
They're serious.
I know them very well.

59:20.690 --> 59:23.090
They got a truck
for guys that drive cars...

59:23.192 --> 59:25.456
and they got something else
for guys that walk, like me.

59:25.562 --> 59:29.965
Okay, okay. Did I ever tell you
we could keep this neat and clean?

59:30.066 --> 59:33.035
- I ever give you that line of horseshit?
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

59:33.136 --> 59:35.536
You been on the level, I give you that.

59:35.638 --> 59:38.038
Uncle will appreciate
what you've given me.

59:38.141 --> 59:40.939
Okay.
You see what I mean?

59:41.044 --> 59:43.012
You see the position I'm in?

59:45.014 --> 59:47.141
Have a nice day.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.640
- Where are they?
- In the trunk.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:50.110
Put the guns in the bag.
Put the bags in the cart.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:53.148
- Where's the money?
- Right here. You wanna count it?

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:57.151
<i>No time. I gotta be at the Sharon
railroad station at 3:30. Let's get going.</i>

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.221
Fine with me.

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:05.118
- What's in the bags?
- Three of 'em are filled with bread.

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:09.892
The others have got, uh, meat, potatoes,
beer, vegetables, shit like that.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.024
- What are you giving me?
- The bread.

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:15.434
A man can always use a little bread
to feed the goddamn pigeons.

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:19.167
Go find yourself some squirrels.
Squirrels love the bread.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:22.039
You wife make you do the shopping too?

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.340
You haven't got too much time,
and I'm in kind of a hurry myself.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.847
I don't have the time
to explain married life to you...

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:29.349
and besides,
if I did, you wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.750
So let's just get down to business, huh?

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.254
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.757
<i>Don't get your bowels in an uproar.
They're for somebody else.</i>

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.225
Hurry up. Those look like
fuckin' army guns to me.

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:41.922
Do you wanna see one?

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:46.525
Huh? No way. Just fill up the bags
and put a couple of loaves on top.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:51.232
Okay, you got nine. 38s here
and one. 357. Good stuff.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.002
Hope you appreciate what I did for ya.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.170
My friend, your name is
in that great golden book in the sky.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.475
I'll be in touch.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.042
Hello. Foley there?

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.849
Dave Foley.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:44.984
No, I don't care to give my name.
Stop fartin' around and get me Foley.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.134
We could take him now.

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.478
We could.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.072
We could also do what we're supposed to do, which
is wait and see who comes to pick up the stuff.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:44.153
Let's go.
Give me that paper.

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.155
This is Sauter.
I'm in position.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.561
I can't see Foley from here.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.633
I can.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:26.210
<i>- Recognize 'em?
- Nah, they look harmless to me.</i>

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.408
<i>They're after machine guns, remember?</i>

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.490
<i>- Yeah?
- I hate to bother you, man...</i>

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.860
but don't we have some kind
of an agreement and all?

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.694
Yeah.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.597
Well?

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.602
<i>Well what?</i>

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.604
Well, Christ,
are we gonna do somethin'?

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.401
Sure.

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:56.501
Quit playing games.
What the hell's going on here?

01:06:56.612 --> 01:07:00.048
<i>- This some kind of joke?
- No, ma'am.</i>

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:03.050
I plan on sitting here
for about two hours...

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:07.680
and in the meantime if every car that I saw when
I came in here doesn't leave, then I'll know it.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.123
<i>- Around 5:30 I'll know if you're trying to tip me in.
- Oh, look, man!</i>

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.567
Hey, if you're all right,
we'll go where I tell ya...

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:30.474
I'll give you some machine guns,
you give me some money, and that'll be that.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.877
This is a trick.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.473
You think so?

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.484
The money, man.
Give us back the money.

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.486
Fuck you.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.489
Hey, you made a deal, man.
You wanna back out, back out.

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.491
But, uh, no refunds.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.323
Leave it, Pete.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.261
Let's get something to eat.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.325
Damn.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.452
<i>Maybe they'll come down
back of his car.</i>

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.999
<i>- Think quick. Is there anything we can bust 'em
under? - No, not a goddamn thing.</i>

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.295
So we got two possibilities.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.303
He's still here.
We can wait and bust him if he tries to leave.

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:32.169
Or we can wait and maybe
bust 'em all if they come back.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:36.005
<i>Or they come back and go
someplace else and we lose 'em in the traffic.</i>

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.376
<i>- What do we do?
- Let me think.</i>

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.448
<i>It's your party.</i>

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.620
We take him.

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:57.819
United States Treasury.
Move, and you're a fuckin' dead man.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:10:00.828
Get out of the car,
and keep your hands in plain sight.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.057
Get out!

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:06.601
Put your hands on top of the car.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.102
You're under arrest
for violation of federal law.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.641
Tell him we got the man
where he was supposed to be...

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.971
<i>and we need a warrant
to search the car.</i>

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.977
You don't have to answer any questions.

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:19.980
If you answer any questions, your answers
may be used against you in a court of law.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.983
- Do you understand what I have read to you?
- You knew it. You knew it!

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:25.986
Sure.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:28.352
Oh, that fuckin' bastard.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.948
That fuckin' bastard!

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.656
What fuckin' bastard? Huh?

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.300
Oh, no.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:42.135
I'll take care of that myself.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:09.260
Well?
How'd it come out?

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:12.892
It went fine. Just fine.
He had five M16s, just like you said.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.970
Now, that does it, huh?

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.665
- Does what?
- You know.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.674
You said you wanted a reason.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.370
That thing we talked about.
That thing up in New Hampshire there.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:25.379
You said you needed a reason.

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.210
Oh, that.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:31.275
Well, you gonna go up there with me
and tell 'em what a nice guy I am?

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.446
That truck thing - the booze.

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:37.457
Hey, Dave, come on.
Don't jerk my chain, okay?

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.789
<i>- Here, sir.
- You know what I'm talking about.</i>

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.886
How far you gonna go for me?

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.232
I already made the call.

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:47.802
I called the U.S. Attorney up there...

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:50.303
and told him you were instrumental
in bringing about a major arrest.

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.306
That's right. That's it.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.672
And he said -

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.678
He's pretty mean,
that guy up there.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.248
He said, "Well, that's a start anyway. "

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.749
What does that mean?

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:05.752
Well, he asked, "Is he working on
anything else for you?

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:08.914
I'd like it better, "he said," if he was working
on something else for you. "

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:11.925
- Something else?
- You know how it is, Eddie.

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:15.485
I mean, it's one thing to just go
and trade one guy for another one...

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:19.533
but when you got a guy that's joined up
that's gonna keep on sending you more stuff-

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:22.035
- That's shit.
- Look at it his way.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.935
- The man's from a different district.
- Shit. Shit.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.032
His guys grabbed you fair and square...

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.043
and you wouldn't plead out on 'em.

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:32.636
You made 'em go through a trial.

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.841
You wouldn't play ball.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:38.442
He wanted me to cop out
on the guys that stole the stuff.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:43.056
Well, you can't blame him for that,
now, can you?

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:46.321
And you wouldn't tell him. So he convicted you,
and now he's got you in the box.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:49.226
And somebody from a different district
calls up and says...

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.492
"Hey, Coyle did me a favor.
Leave him go. "

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.501
It's only natural a man's gonna ask,
"Well, what did he do for me?"

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:57.128
Look, I can't give him that man
he wants up in New Hampshire.

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:59.332
If I did, I'm dead. That's all there is to it.

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.841
He can't ask me to walk out
and commit suicide for him.

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:04.105
He's not asking you for anything.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.613
- I gave you the guns.
- It was your idea.

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.945
Oh, no. You said it first.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.713
You said you wanted a reason.
I gave you a reason.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.721
And I went through - I made the call.
You just don't like what the call got you.

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.723
I can't help that, Eddie.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:19.794
So, what do you want, goddamn it?

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:24.923
The man up there, he said he'd like it better
if he could go in to the judge and tell him...

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:28.560
that you'd made one good case for Uncle
and you were working on some others.

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.161
It'd show you'd rehabilitated yourself.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:36.067
You're telling me
to turn permanent fink.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:39.409
Permanent goddamn fink.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:43.251
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to...

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.513
except be in federal district court
in New Hampshire...

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:49.182
for disposition
on a charge of stolen goods.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:52.260
Whatever else you do
is because you want to.

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.929
That ain't right, Dave.
That ain't right. You set me up.

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:59.057
Look, Eddie...

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:05.303
go someplace
and have yourself a glass of beer...

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.773
and have a long talk with yourself.

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:13.747
The only one fuckin' Eddie Coyle
is Eddie Coyle.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.750
You wanted a call.
I made the call.

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.343
You gave me a grab to make the call.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:23.585
You want something else,
you gotta start thinking about how to get that.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:28.594
I can certainly understand a man
that don't wanna rat on his friends...

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:31.598
but you gotta understand
the position I'm in.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:36.535
All I can give ya is what I tell ya
I can give ya, and I gave you that.

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.607
What you do next is entirely up to you.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:45.772
I should have known better
than to trust a cop.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.907
My own goddamn mother
could have told me that.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:51.349
Everybody ought to listen to his mother.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.418
Yes?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.920
I, uh, brought some groceries
for Scalise.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.923
- Is he expecting you?
- Well, he asked me to come up here and all.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.926
I just drove about two hours.
I hope so.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.996
Just a minute.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:39.062
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me. Coyle.</i>

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.067
I brought the groceries.

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.137
Hey, Eddie.
Okay, bring it in.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.475
I'd help you,
but I'd freeze my ass off.

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.544
That's okay.

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:54.215
<i>Johnny! Hey, Johnny!</i>

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.454
<i>Come on in, Eddie.</i>

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.422
This is Wanda.
Wanda, meet Eddie.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.991
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.287
Tell him what you do, honey.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.295
You tell him.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.831
She's a stewardess.

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:13.458
No kidding.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.037
Get the man a beer.
Come on.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.108
- They look pretty good.
- Ought to.

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:32.311
Had to go 80 apiece for 'em.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.481
I got five Smiths, two Lugers...

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.491
a. 357 Mag.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:41.051
You can hold up a bank with that thing
all by yourself.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.260
Hey, this is okay.

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:54.274
I been on ice a couple of times myself,
you know, but, uh, never this nice.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:56.276
I'm not on ice.

01:16:56.378 --> 01:17:00.474
I rent this place from a bulldozer driver.
You know, seasonal work.

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:05.485
The owner understands.
Thinks I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread.

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.487
Hey, uh, that's pretty nice in there too.

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.489
- Oh, her?
- Yeah.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:12.492
It's very warm down here.
She don't wear no pants.

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:15.495
Every now and then I just reach down here,
she comes off like she's on electricity.

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:18.532
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's a great life if you don't weaken.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.602
A great life.
Come on in.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.472
That's pretty nice meat you brought.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.065
Hey, thanks.
What do I owe ya?

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.576
All told it comes to, uh...

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.579
$4,500.

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:34.945
<i>- Sit down.
- My God. That's a lot of money for some meat.</i>

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.019
<i>- The money - What'd you say it was?
- 4,500.</i>

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:49.555
Hey, uh, Jimmy,
you gonna need any more guns?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.065
I could use anything you can get.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:55.068
We're gonna need at least five Monday,
maybe more to do the job right.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.070
I like to have a couple extras in the car...

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:00.403
so if I gotta use one on the job
I can wipe it off and heave it down the river.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:04.138
Everything goes right, we'll probably
be dumping the whole eight Monday night.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.948
You know when you're gonna need 'em?

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.917
I'll give you a call. You can come and meet me.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.419
When I call you
I'll tell you where I'm gonna be.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.422
You gonna be around?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.493
I got that thing coming up
in New Hampshire, you know.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:24.158
I hope you're all right.

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:26.234
Me too, Scal.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.504
Me too.

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.792
Okay?

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.798
<i>- No tails or anything?
- We were alone all the way from Fall River.</i>

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.733
<i>If they're watching us,
they're doing it from an airplane.</i>

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:05.238
- What was it with Dillon?
- He's worried about Coyle.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:09.333
<i>He thinks maybe Coyle is swapping us
for that thing he's got going in New Hampshire.</i>

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:12.345
- You think so?
- No way. All he knew was we wanted guns.

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:15.348
What could he tell 'em? He don't know
where we've been till we've been there.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:19.511
- There's no way Coyle could set us up.
- From what I know, Coyle's a stand-up guy.

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.089
<i>- You're sure no one tailed you?
- No one.</i>

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:25.751
- This Waylon got any kids?
- Grown up and moved away.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:28.955
Just him and his wife.
Nice lady.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.192
<i>She'll probably fix you breakfast
while you're waiting for us.</i>

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.459
<i>Martha, are you coming?</i>

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.461
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.861
<i>Hurry, because I'll be late.</i>

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.667
<i>- Two of 'em.
- Big meeting today.</i>

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:50.670
Beautiful.
Mom and Dad coming down together.

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:01.674
<i>April fool, motherfuckers.</i>

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.655
Drop it.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.231
<i>Let me have another beer.</i>

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.268
Uh, straight bourbon.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:52.960
I, uh - I thought about it,
what we were saying...

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:56.401
and, uh, I'm ready to deal with ya.

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.404
It's your decision, Eddie.

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:02.533
It's my decision,
but I don't want no surprises.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.545
I gotta know just how far
you'll go for me.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:09.048
That depends on how far you go for me.
You know that.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.209
Okay.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:15.551
Well, if I give you this,
I can't do no time.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:20.026
These guys have got friends, you know,
and I wouldn't live to get out.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.726
Well, we can take care of you.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.732
Okay.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.895
Now, uh, suppose I was to go out west -
Arizona, for instance.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.906
You'd have to fix me up
with a new identity and all that.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.909
You know what I mean.
You do it all the time.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.912
It's been done,
but I can't guarantee it.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.915
All I can promise, in all honesty...

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.248
is to carry the ball for you
as best I can...

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:47.844
but you've gotta make it good.

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.584
You don't make it
much of a proposition.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.819
<i>It's your proposition, Eddie.</i>

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.831
I'm just here to listen.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:01.335
And so far you haven't told me anything.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:09.637
Suppose I was to give you those guys
been knockin' off the banks.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:12.645
- Eddie -
- How far would you go for that?

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:17.241
Last night I would've gone
the distance, Eddie, but that was last night.

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.946
I guess you haven't seen the paper.

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:26.953
You're too late, Eddie.
It all happened without you.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:20.313
I was wondering if you could
handle something for us.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.907
More than likely.
Depends, I suppose, but more than likely.

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:27.283
This is pretty important.
That's why we got in touch with you.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:29.288
Somebody have a problem?

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:32.291
Jimmy Scal, Artie Valentropo,
Fritzie Webber and Phil Kenney.

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:35.294
They got bagged in a house
up in Milton there.

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.921
- Murder one. Hearing this afternoon.
- I warned 'em.

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:40.057
- Who? Warned who?
- Jimmy Scal.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:45.765
Picked up on something the other day.
This guy, uh - guy we know, me and Scal.

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:48.342
He's up for sentencing.
It's almost a mandatory, you know.

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:50.206
Name of Coyle, isn't it?

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.940
I had him driving a truck for me
and a fellow up there in New Hampshire...

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:56.949
and he got hooked,
which is why he's coming up.

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.952
<i>I was figurin'
he was thinkin' about dumpin' me.</i>

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:02.420
He wouldn't do that
unless he took out a will.

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:05.425
So he dumped on Jimmy and Artie,
the bastard.

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:08.428
Scal gave his lawyer that name Coyle
to give to The Man.

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.327
Coyle.
Eddie Fingers, right?

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.093
Do you want him hit?

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.328
The Man wants him hit.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:17.336
Tonight.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.840
I, uh -

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:24.104
I can't do it tonight.

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:27.511
You see, for Christ's sake,
this takes a little while, you know.

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:31.517
I mean, I gotta line things up -
a car and a place and a driver.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.780
The Man says tonight.

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:36.118
When I hit somebody I do it right...

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:39.660
not like some goddamn kid
found his girl fuckin' somebody else.

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:42.229
- But he says tonight.
- He says, he says!

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:47.499
- Five grand in front.
- You'll get it when you do the job.

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:50.127
Want me to make a hit on the cuff?

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:52.138
Look, that's not the way it happens.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.606
The Man knows that,
and I'm beginning to wonder if he sent you.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.870
- Now, look-
- "Now, look" nothing.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:27:00.744
I treat a man with respect,
I expect to be treated with a little respect.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:04.249
The Man knows how I work, what I do.
That's why he wants me.

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:08.721
I done the Polack and Jimmy the Whale.
So he knows what I do.

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:11.724
So he knows with me
it's strictly cash in advance.

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.885
No money, no hit.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:16.896
- No credit cards whatsoever.
- The Man isn't gonna like that.

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.898
Look, he came looking for me.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.266
Now, I had some hard things
The Man asked me to do, and I did them.

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:27.102
Nobody got hurt but the guy
that was supposed to get hurt...

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:30.041
and nobody on anything I ever did
ended up on death row...

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:32.237
which is more than I can say
for some I know.

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.645
He knows you're good.

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.683
Okay. I'll be at my place.

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:40.242
We do this thing, we do it the right way.
All right?

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:47.219
I'll tell him how you feel.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.951
- Thanks, Dillon.
- See ya.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.900
You makin' any money?

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:29.902
Not exactly.

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:34.168
If you were to ask me, I'd have to tell you
I'm not having a very good day.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.175
Why is that?

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:39.178
You heard about what happened
over in Randolph there?

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.248
Aw, that was a rough thing.

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:48.217
Yeah, but this is the end of Artie Van,
and Jimmy too, for that matter.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.587
I look at it philosophically.

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:53.024
You win some, you lose some.
Right?

01:28:53.127 --> 01:28:56.028
They made, what?
A quarter of a mil in a month?

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:59.998
You're gonna get the fuzz mad.
And they killed those two guys, right?

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.467
Somebody set them up.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:05.471
The cops were waitin' for 'em
right there in the house.

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:08.770
Somebody set them up.
I'd like to know who that was.

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.776
Yeah, I imagine they would too.

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:14.109
<i>I know Jimmy Scal good.
Oh, hell, you know that.</i>

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:18.343
Hate to see Jimmy take this one.
He's in forever.

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:23.014
Look, I still say
they knew what they were getting into.

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:25.024
Did anybody feel sorry for you?

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:28.857
No. You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
asking me that.

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:32.364
You went through, didn't ya? You didn't
throw somebody else in. You were a big boy.

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.368
You gotta have respect for them.
They're big boys too.

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.370
Yeah.

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.372
Well, I'm all wrapped up now.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:42.034
Well, you get probably two years...

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:44.043
and you do eight months.

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:46.045
That's a third.

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.047
That's no sweat.

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.117
It's for you, Dillon.

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.521
Don't take it so goddamn serious.

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.604
Yeah?

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.833
Yeah, I know who this is.

01:30:13.941 --> 01:30:16.842
It's a funny thing.
He's in here right now.

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:20.937
Put on a big performance how sorry he is,
how pissed off he is they got set up.

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:23.516
It's almost enough to make me mad.

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.210
Enough of that.

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:30.654
You get somebody up here this afternoon
with an envelope.

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:34.521
Or maybe tonight.

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:37.757
You get the envelope here,
I'll see what I can do.

01:30:58.085 --> 01:31:01.816
That was a friend of mine. Calls to tell me
he can't go to the Bruins tonight.

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:05.825
So, uh, why don't you forget your troubles
and come to the game with me, huh?

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:10.296
We'll have a little dinner.
I'll take the night off, we'll see a good game.

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:12.593
<i>Blackhawks.
What do you say?</i>

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.602
Sounds good.

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:19.669
<i>So, uh, come back around 6:00 or so.</i>

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.709
I'd say stay, but, uh,
the way you're going...

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.472
<i>you might not be able to see the game
or anything, you stay.</i>

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:29.573
We'll have a little wine, good steak.
Then we go to the game.

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:31.584
Right. You're right.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:35.349
Look, I got a few things to do.
I'll catch you back here about 6:00. Okay?

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.424
Okay.

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.838
<i>Get that son of a bitch!</i>

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.088
Hey!

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.728
Can't understand where that kid is.

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:19.732
That friend I was telling you about,
he gave me both his tickets.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.734
So I invited my wife's nephew.

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:24.930
I can't understand where he is.
He loves hockey, that kid.

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:27.507
- Great game.
- Great game.

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:34.141
- You want some more?
- I'll get it.

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:36.216
Excuse me.

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:41.310
Pardon me.

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:07.447
Get him!

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:11.083
- That's his.
- Where is he?

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:13.153
He's gone for beers.

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.857
Jesus Christ, man.
What'd you bring him here for?

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:20.860
Because he's too smart to come out
for any other kind of party.

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:25.399
Because there's 15,000 people here looking
at the Bruins and they don't give a fuck about us.

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.763
Now get the fuck out of his seat.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:02.494
- When you piss, you piss.
- That's beer, goddamn it.

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:07.730
It's hard to carry beer in a crowd like this.
Did you ever try it?

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:14.610
<i>Imagine being a kid like that.</i>

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:18.446
What is he, 24 or somethin'?

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:22.747
Greatest hockey player in the world.

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:26.156
Number four! Bobby Orr!

01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:31.297
<i>Jesus, what a future he's got, huh?</i>

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:51.243
<i>That's right! Get 'im!</i>

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:57.357
- Slam 'im!
- Come on!

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:05.993
- Knock 'im out!
- Yeah!

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:14.803
<i>Penalty for high sticking.</i>

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:18.174
<i>Number 11, two minutes,
for high sticking.</i>

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:23.341
Hey, I forgot to tell you,
I got some girls.

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:28.621
Oh, I don't know, man.
It's pretty late.

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:31.191
Come on!
Let's make a night of it.

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:37.191
Hey, I can't, man. I gotta go home.
I gotta get the car back.

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:39.528
Well, where's your car?

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:42.067
South - South End. I, uh -

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:45.502
I was there, and I took
a trolley over to your place.

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.506
I ne -
Just never got back for it.

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:51.339
Shit. And, you know, there's, uh,
these girls. They're absolutely all right.

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:54.471
But there's no way.
I mean, they're in Brookline.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:58.450
Hey, look, I could drive you there in the car
and then go home.

01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:01.521
But I can't hang around much,
'cause I got a test tomorrow.

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:08.487
Whatever's fair, you know.

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.504
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hmm?

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:20.506
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:24.237
- You all right?
- Beautiful.

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.279
Beautiful.

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:29.872
- You gonna be able to drive?
- Oh, yeah.

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.952
No sweat.

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:36.250
Hey, great game, huh?

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.322
Where do you want me to go?

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:46.490
Hey, Eddie, you tell him.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.568
Where's your car?

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:53.105
- He's out.
- Go around the Garden.

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:56.438
Head for the expressway going south
in case he wakes up.

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.642
I know what's going on.

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:05.651
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:09.348
You just drive.
If I was you, I'd drive to Quincy...

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:13.119
pick roads where I could go pretty fast
without making anyone look suspicious...

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:15.457
and come out on Morrissey Boulevard.

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:19.431
I'd look for a blue Galaxy in the parking lot
of the Chalet Swiss bowling alleys.

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:22.058
Somebody said something
about some money.

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.569
If I was you,
I'd look hard for that Galaxy.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.573
Drive that Galaxy back to Boston,
you let me off.

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:30.303
If I was you, I'd look in
the glove compartment of that car...

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.903
before dropping it off
in the nigger district.

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.122
<i>Jesus!</i>

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.892
Jesus Christ. Hey, slow down, you stupid shit.
You wanna get arrested or somethin'?

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:26.194
<i>I got nervous.
Jesus Christ, that was loud.</i>

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.701
<i>- That's why I used a. 22.
- Yeah? That was loud enough.</i>

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:33.705
I ever let off a. 38 two-incher in here,
you'd go right off the road.

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:37.174
<i>- Is he dead?
- If he's not now, he's never gonna be.</i>

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.746
Now slow down and get off this road.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:58.990
This car looks a lot
like the other one in this light.

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:01.659
That's the idea. Now you're learnin'.

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:05.330
The cops have been looking at that car all night.
Now they see one looks just like it.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.566
Help me stuff him down.

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:13.880
Yeah, they won't search that
for a couple hours.

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:20.680
Hey, lock it.
Keeps the volunteers out.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.060
Not a bad car.

01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:31.063
Take the Memorial Drive
to the Mass Avenue Bridge.

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.326
I gotta get rid of this gun.

01:39:57.124 --> 01:40:01.925
I heard a guy on television the other night,
he was talking about pigeons.

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:04.930
He called them flying rats.

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.932
I thought that was pretty good.

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:11.198
What he had in mind, he was gonna give 'em
the flu or something to make them extinct.

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:15.469
Now, uh, there was a guy that got shit on,
probably got shit on again.

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:18.807
Then he got mad.
They ruined his suit or somethin'.

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:23.872
So he's gonna spend the rest of his life getting
even with pigeons 'cause they ruined a $400 suit.

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.912
Now, uh, there's no percentage in that...

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:31.458
because there are probably
10 million pigeons in Boston alone...

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.992
all of them laying eggs every day...

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:36.562
which generally produce more pigeons...

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:41.566
all, uh, dropping tons and tons of shit
every day, rain or shine.

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:45.195
And this guy in New York,
he's gonna, well -

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:48.672
There just aren't gonna be
any more of them in this world.

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:53.645
Yeah, a man gets desperate.

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:56.648
He does a few things,
he knows it won't work.

01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:00.083
Pretty soon he quits, packs it all in,
goes away someplace.

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.087
It's the only way there is.

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:05.488
Okay, you gave us Scalise,
and we're grateful.

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:08.959
You can't talk about Coyle,
you can't talk about Coyle. It's all right.

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:11.031
- Thanks.
- Screw.

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:14.532
We've been friends a long time now.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:19.402
I never asked a friend yet to do somethin'
he really couldn't do, I knew he couldn't do it.

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.844
Have a nice day.
