WEBVTT

00:00.685 --> 00:04.019
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:04.022 --> 00:06.632
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

00:06.635 --> 00:08.242
Hey.

00:12.602 --> 00:15.036
What's this?

00:15.038 --> 00:16.590
I got a source in the ivory tower.

00:16.593 --> 00:17.941
She gave me that.

00:22.646 --> 00:24.846
Recognize him?

00:24.848 --> 00:27.048
Yeah.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.652
It's the junkie I caught
breaking into my car...

00:32.456 --> 00:35.790
the night me and Erin
moved Bingham's body.

00:35.792 --> 00:38.860
Well, his name is Ruben Gilbright.

00:38.862 --> 00:40.862
My guess is Woods is gonna use him

00:40.864 --> 00:43.257
to try and build a
homicide case against you.

00:45.292 --> 00:47.148
You really think these
guys are that far along?

00:47.151 --> 00:48.203
Oh, I'm not sure,

00:48.206 --> 00:51.207
but I'd rather not take any chances.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.643
Right, I'm gonna

00:53.646 --> 00:56.378
look into this Ruben,
see what he's about,

00:56.380 --> 00:58.680
maybe catch him dirty.

00:58.682 --> 01:01.249
Destroy what little
credibility he has left.

01:01.251 --> 01:04.718
Hopefully, we'll put this
thing to bed, once and for all.

01:04.721 --> 01:06.478
Let me handle it.

01:06.481 --> 01:08.556
You can't get anywhere near it.

01:11.361 --> 01:12.527
I got this, Al.

01:15.065 --> 01:17.332
I got it.

01:21.405 --> 01:22.704
You know,

01:22.706 --> 01:24.155
it's against the law to loiter.

01:24.158 --> 01:26.007
No, actually, it's not. I can stand

01:26.009 --> 01:27.509
right here all day if I want to.

01:27.511 --> 01:29.291
Relax.

01:29.294 --> 01:31.412
It was a joke... Meaningless pleasantry.

01:31.415 --> 01:32.781
Yeah, I'd prefer you be on time

01:32.783 --> 01:34.362
rather than crack
meaningless pleasantries.

01:34.364 --> 01:36.763
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, well, I got jammed up.

01:39.723 --> 01:41.289
But if it's a problem,

01:41.291 --> 01:42.724
we can figure it out.

01:42.726 --> 01:44.025
You got a problem?

01:44.027 --> 01:45.794
- Excuse me?
- I don't like your tone,

01:45.796 --> 01:47.315
or the fact that you owe me two grand.

01:47.317 --> 01:49.197
Two grand? What the
hell you talking about?

01:49.199 --> 01:50.698
I want my money.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.848
Your money?

01:51.851 --> 01:52.867
Whoa, Ray.

01:52.869 --> 01:54.712
Whoa, whoa. Just chill, chill, chill.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.771
Don't tell me to chill!

01:56.773 --> 01:58.740
I want my paper in my hand.

01:58.742 --> 02:00.817
All right, all right,
I'll get you your paper.

02:00.820 --> 02:01.736
Today.

02:02.879 --> 02:05.079
Okay, I'll get it to you today.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.818
Ray.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.119
What the hell, man?

02:14.991 --> 02:17.128
- The hell was that? Huh?
- Never mind.

02:17.131 --> 02:18.958
- That wasn't cool, bro.
- Really not sure.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.060
All right.

02:21.665 --> 02:23.731
The hell is wrong with Ray, man?

02:23.733 --> 02:24.899
That was uncalled-for, right?

02:24.901 --> 02:26.468
I'll handle it. I'll handle it.

02:26.470 --> 02:28.308
Ray?

02:28.311 --> 02:29.526
What the hell was that?

02:29.529 --> 02:31.238
Look, Ruzek, I'm sorry. Was a banger...

02:31.241 --> 02:32.907
He was down the alley. He was watching.

02:32.909 --> 02:34.409
He was making you to be a
cop. I had to do my thing.

02:34.411 --> 02:36.222
So you put a gun to my head?

02:36.225 --> 02:37.612
You just put a gun to my head!

02:37.614 --> 02:38.913
Look, all right?

02:38.915 --> 02:40.915
Dude is a shot-caller
for the Latin Hoods.

02:40.917 --> 02:42.417
I've been working too hard for too long

02:42.419 --> 02:44.251
to get in with these guys.
I couldn't jeopardize that.

02:44.253 --> 02:47.222
Ray, I'm 15 feet closer,
I put your ass down.

02:47.225 --> 02:48.623
You understand that, don't you?

02:48.625 --> 02:50.625
I know what I'm doing. I'm a cop.

02:50.627 --> 02:52.360
Used to be a cop.

02:52.362 --> 02:54.162
Yo,

02:54.164 --> 02:55.930
you were protecting
your cover. We get it.

02:55.932 --> 02:57.599
All right, let's all move on. Yeah?

02:57.601 --> 03:00.635
- All right.
- Great.

03:00.637 --> 03:04.105
Ray. Ray.

03:04.107 --> 03:05.974
The rips on the stash houses...

03:05.976 --> 03:08.331
Bodies are piling up.
What are you hearing?

03:08.334 --> 03:09.776
Crickets. I hear nothing.

03:09.779 --> 03:11.446
Okay, can you some digging for us?

03:11.448 --> 03:12.910
Yeah, but people are shook.

03:12.913 --> 03:13.846
They scared.

03:13.849 --> 03:15.332
They're gonna need a
little bit more spinach

03:15.334 --> 03:16.504
if you want them to get talking.

03:16.506 --> 03:18.005
Well, you know the drill.

03:18.008 --> 03:19.892
You get more spinach when
we get more information.

03:19.894 --> 03:22.891
You ready to go?

03:22.893 --> 03:25.793
Hey, look, Adam...

03:25.795 --> 03:28.296
Come on, you know I'm good for it.

03:28.298 --> 03:30.099
I always deliver gold.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.809 --> 03:41.743
Ray, this is the last advance.

03:41.745 --> 03:43.496
You hear me?

03:43.499 --> 03:45.500
Don't ever pull a gun on me again.

03:49.206 --> 03:51.386
Hey, I feel sorry for the man too,

03:51.388 --> 03:52.587
but what happened to Ray

03:52.589 --> 03:54.246
is his fault, not yours.

03:54.249 --> 03:57.283
Let that guilt go.

03:57.286 --> 03:58.574
Units on the city wide,

03:58.577 --> 04:00.667
we're getting multiple
reports of shots fired

04:00.670 --> 04:02.391
at 1360 South Waycrest.

04:02.394 --> 04:04.073
Ah, that ain't far. Come on.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.790
5021 David.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.292
This call appears to be bona fide.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.007
Out of the way! Out of the way!

04:14.010 --> 04:15.550
Keep these cars coming.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.245
- We're moving in.
- You ready?

04:20.850 --> 04:22.684
- I have a body.
- Copy.

04:22.686 --> 04:24.419
- Kev, door, door.
- Door, door, door.

04:29.693 --> 04:30.725
Clear.

04:32.696 --> 04:34.195
I see a gun.

04:35.732 --> 04:37.231
All right, we're clear.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.866
Okay.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.435
We got two down, both nonresponsive.

04:41.471 --> 04:42.433
Kev.

04:42.436 --> 04:43.980
Active shooter in the building.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.666
This sucks.

04:50.146 --> 04:52.046
Help!

04:52.048 --> 04:54.882
- Kev?
- Chicago PD!

04:54.884 --> 04:57.792
Oh, please!

04:57.795 --> 05:00.329
- Please, you gotta help him!
- Clear!

05:00.332 --> 05:01.441
Please!

05:01.444 --> 05:03.278
All right. All right.

05:03.281 --> 05:04.816
All right, he's got a light pulse.

05:04.819 --> 05:06.593
- Open your eyes, papi!
- Come here.

05:07.831 --> 05:08.863
Come on, kid.

05:08.866 --> 05:10.397
- Look at me, huh?
- 5021, emergency.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.566
Come on, come on, come on.

05:11.568 --> 05:12.934
We got a third victim down.

05:12.936 --> 05:15.403
Talk to me, bro.

05:15.405 --> 05:17.605
No!

05:17.667 --> 05:19.157
No!

05:19.160 --> 05:21.142
- No!
- Gunshot wounds to the head.

05:21.144 --> 05:23.558
Tender age victim. Roll
CFD down here right now.

05:23.561 --> 05:24.726
Hurry the hell up.

05:24.729 --> 05:26.396
No, my baby!

05:26.399 --> 05:28.425
Ambo on the way.

05:36.459 --> 05:38.359
Oh, my God!

05:41.741 --> 05:45.658
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:45.661 --> 05:48.091
Happened right before we got here.

05:48.094 --> 05:49.284
By the time we arrived,

05:49.287 --> 05:50.805
shooters were already in the wind.

05:50.807 --> 05:53.007
Huh.

05:53.009 --> 05:54.885
It's another stash house rip.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.145
Yeah, and they got the hell
up out of here, too, sarge.

05:57.147 --> 05:59.135
Dropped a couple bricks
of heroin on the way out.

05:59.138 --> 06:00.815
- No cash.
- Huh.

06:00.817 --> 06:02.617
Bricks have a cobra logo this time.

06:02.619 --> 06:04.686
Both guards were dead,
just like the other rips.

06:04.688 --> 06:06.013
Sarge.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.846
Okay, get the casings to ballistics.

06:07.849 --> 06:09.651
See if they're a match
with the other robberies.

06:09.653 --> 06:10.792
- Copy.
- Door down the hall

06:10.794 --> 06:11.959
may as well have been paper.

06:11.961 --> 06:13.227
Bullets went flying through it.

06:13.229 --> 06:15.025
Little boy in there
was collateral damage.

06:15.028 --> 06:16.278
Mm.

06:16.281 --> 06:17.474
Hey.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.800
- What's going on, guys?
- Kenny.

06:18.802 --> 06:19.834
Hey, what brings you out here?

06:19.836 --> 06:21.037
About to execute a search warrant.

06:21.039 --> 06:22.669
Looks like we're late to the party.

06:22.672 --> 06:23.622
Why you guys here?

06:23.625 --> 06:25.038
Ah, we've been chasing a rip crew.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.137
They're hitting stash houses,

06:26.139 --> 06:27.814
stealing drugs... So far, mostly heroin.

06:27.817 --> 06:29.210
These gangs are eating their own.

06:29.212 --> 06:31.145
- Yeah.
- There he is.

06:31.147 --> 06:32.580
Happy to turn over what we got.

06:32.582 --> 06:33.661
Good to see you, Kenny.

06:33.664 --> 06:35.163
You letting Intelligence take this?

06:35.166 --> 06:36.317
Rachael, relax.

06:36.319 --> 06:37.568
If you guys have been working this,

06:37.570 --> 06:38.570
why didn't you de-conflict it

06:38.572 --> 06:40.672
with HIDTA?

06:40.675 --> 06:42.589
Guys, this is Detective Rojas.

06:42.592 --> 06:45.026
I did the paperwork. There
were no direct conflicts.

06:45.028 --> 06:46.603
We got an in-service call.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.396
Said shots fired. Here we are.

06:48.398 --> 06:50.525
Intelligence is taking the lead.

06:54.459 --> 06:55.791
Wow.

06:55.794 --> 06:57.515
Look, Rojas is good police, right?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.240
She's just a little
rough around the edges.

06:59.242 --> 07:01.064
Hey, there's nothing
wrong with that, Kenny.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.630
All right, we'll keep you in the loop.

07:02.633 --> 07:05.034
- Good to see you, man.
- Thanks, Hank.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.084
Ms. Montero.

07:10.086 --> 07:12.687
I'm Officer Burgess.
This is Detective Upton.

07:12.689 --> 07:15.189
We're so sorry about your loss.

07:15.191 --> 07:17.358
If it's okay, we'd like
to ask you a few questions.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.360
- I'm okay.
- All right.

07:19.362 --> 07:21.129
Thank you.

07:21.131 --> 07:22.864
Did you see what happened?

07:22.866 --> 07:24.275
No.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.877
I was in the shower.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.127
Then I heard loud
bangs from the hallway.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.749
Do you know who's
living in the apartment

07:29.752 --> 07:30.951
where the shooting happened?

07:30.954 --> 07:32.286
We just moved in.

07:32.289 --> 07:34.089
It was supposed to be
a better neighborhood.

07:34.092 --> 07:35.543
Okay, did you see anyone suspicious?

07:35.546 --> 07:38.081
Someone running away, someone...

07:44.106 --> 07:45.820
They always tell you, whatever happens,

07:45.822 --> 07:48.055
you never talk to the police,

07:48.057 --> 07:49.791
but I don't care.

07:49.793 --> 07:52.226
These animals took my boy.

07:52.228 --> 07:53.828
What did you see, Sarah?

07:53.830 --> 07:55.763
Two men going down the fire escape.

07:55.765 --> 07:56.971
Can you describe them?

07:56.974 --> 07:58.140
Latinos.

07:58.143 --> 07:59.966
Young, like, 20.

07:59.969 --> 08:01.783
Okay. Anything else?

08:01.786 --> 08:03.736
- They had ski caps.
- Ski caps...

08:03.739 --> 08:06.455
And they drove off in a dark car.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.909
After I heard all the shooting,

08:07.911 --> 08:10.344
I... I went to look for Felix.

08:10.346 --> 08:12.847
He wasn't feeling well.
He was taking a nap.

08:12.849 --> 08:14.518
And there he was,

08:14.521 --> 08:18.022
blood everywhere.

08:18.025 --> 08:20.521
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:20.523 --> 08:21.622
Ai!

08:21.624 --> 08:23.424
Ai, no!

08:23.426 --> 08:24.659
Oh!

08:24.661 --> 08:26.252
No...

08:26.255 --> 08:27.962
No, my boy!

08:29.599 --> 08:32.416
Ai, no!

08:32.419 --> 08:33.934
We're gonna stay with you, okay?

08:33.937 --> 08:35.102
Come with us.

08:35.104 --> 08:38.506
Oh, my boy. Oh, my baby.

08:38.508 --> 08:40.322
My baby.

08:40.325 --> 08:42.482
Today's rip followed the same MO

08:42.485 --> 08:43.813
as our previous two.

08:43.817 --> 08:45.979
They blast the doors open,
kill everybody inside,

08:45.982 --> 08:47.875
grab money and product, and
get the hell out of there.

08:47.877 --> 08:49.674
Just ran the prints
of the two dead guys.

08:49.677 --> 08:50.843
These two. Nothing.

08:50.846 --> 08:53.046
No names, no criminal history.

08:53.049 --> 08:54.789
That makes six dead bangers.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.494
And Felix Montero.

08:56.497 --> 09:00.399
Just turned ten.

09:00.402 --> 09:02.268
We talked to Felix's mom.

09:02.271 --> 09:04.130
She says she saw two Latinos, 20,

09:04.133 --> 09:06.133
jump into a dark car,
but that's all we got.

09:06.135 --> 09:07.624
Somebody had to see them. They didn't

09:07.627 --> 09:08.664
just disappear into thin air.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.804
All right, so let's double down

09:09.806 --> 09:10.758
on the traffic cams,

09:10.761 --> 09:12.447
start canvassing for more witnesses.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.471
Ask me, we should assume
this is an inside job.

09:14.474 --> 09:15.976
You don't get the
address of a stash house

09:15.978 --> 09:16.978
in the yellow pages.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.312
- Hmm.
- Ah, he's right.

09:18.314 --> 09:19.513
I mean, these guys
aren't just getting lucky.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.936
They know where to go and when to go.

09:20.938 --> 09:23.183
You know, it could be someone
inside the Latin Hoods.

09:23.186 --> 09:24.695
I'ma reach out to a buddy in Gangs.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.864
Good. Chase that.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.199
- All right.
- Everybody else,

09:27.202 --> 09:29.236
reach out to your Cis,

09:29.239 --> 09:33.307
and put some money on the street.

09:33.310 --> 09:37.112
So I dug into this Ruben Gilbright.

09:37.115 --> 09:39.667
He's staying at a
halfway house in Pilsen.

09:39.669 --> 09:40.868
Got his address.

09:40.870 --> 09:43.037
What are you thinking, mm?

09:43.039 --> 09:45.250
You're the subject of this grand jury.

09:45.253 --> 09:47.120
Somebody sees you nail this guy,

09:47.123 --> 09:49.341
they're gonna hit you with a
tampering with a witness charge

09:49.343 --> 09:52.947
on top of everything else.

09:52.949 --> 09:57.185
Al, believe me. I got this.

10:29.719 --> 10:31.085
Hey. Hey!

10:31.087 --> 10:33.062
Grab the fence! Grab it.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.565
- Spread your legs.
- All right.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.490
- Spread your legs!
- Oh, they're spread, man.

10:36.492 --> 10:38.092
You got anything in your pockets

10:38.094 --> 10:39.708
- that's gonna stick me?
- No, I'm clean.

10:39.711 --> 10:40.672
What'd I do?

10:40.675 --> 10:42.041
I saw you selling drugs.

10:42.044 --> 10:43.396
No, I do... I wasn't...

10:43.399 --> 10:44.832
What're you selling, coke?

10:44.834 --> 10:45.797
Huh? Heroin?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.533
No, it ain't like that.

10:47.536 --> 10:48.765
He was just my friend.

10:48.768 --> 10:50.237
- That's Ruben.
- Shut up.

10:50.239 --> 10:51.637
Do not look at me.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.441
- Okay.
- What's this, hm?

10:53.443 --> 10:55.509
- Ruben gave me that cash.
- Don't look at me.

10:55.511 --> 10:58.179
What is this? He gave me that cash.

10:58.181 --> 10:59.747
Oh, really? He just gave it to you?

10:59.749 --> 11:02.164
No, he didn't give it to
me. He loaned it to me.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.278
I'm broke.

11:03.281 --> 11:05.686
He's just helping me out.

11:08.324 --> 11:10.191
This never happened. You understand?

11:11.427 --> 11:12.760
- Yeah?
- Do you understand?

11:12.763 --> 11:14.791
Yeah.

11:20.003 --> 11:21.535
Damn, this place is a step down

11:21.537 --> 11:23.170
from his spot in Lincoln Park.

11:23.172 --> 11:24.617
Denza used to have this sweet pad

11:24.620 --> 11:26.053
overlooking the zoo.

11:26.063 --> 11:28.130
He ain't the king of the jungle no more.

11:33.950 --> 11:36.117
- Help you?
- Yo, we're looking for Ray.

11:36.119 --> 11:37.151
For God's sake, Crystal,

11:37.153 --> 11:40.367
put some clothes on
before you answer the door.

11:40.370 --> 11:41.569
Damn.

11:41.572 --> 11:43.195
What are you guys doing here?

11:43.198 --> 11:44.625
People see you with me...
Could blow my cover.

11:44.627 --> 11:46.234
Ray, I called you. You didn't pick up.

11:46.237 --> 11:47.945
Never occur to you I might be busy?

11:47.948 --> 11:49.634
- I got other clients, you know?
- Ray, the rip crew.

11:49.636 --> 11:51.002
They just hit another stash house.

11:51.005 --> 11:53.940
A tender age boy was
killed in the crossfire.

11:53.943 --> 11:55.383
- They killed a little boy?
- Yeah.

11:55.386 --> 11:56.270
Damn.

11:56.272 --> 11:58.305
And her mom said that she saw

11:58.307 --> 12:00.476
two Hispanics leaving out of a dark car.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.547
Heroin?

12:01.550 --> 12:03.543
Yeah, with a cobra insignia on it.

12:03.546 --> 12:04.904
Does that ring any bells with you?

12:04.906 --> 12:06.001
Nah, but I could

12:06.004 --> 12:07.524
- start doing some sniffing.
- All right.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.093
We're talking about Mexican cartel here,

12:09.095 --> 12:11.095
which means I'm gonna
need some hazard pay.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.414
- No.
- What?

12:12.417 --> 12:13.383
No, no, no, no, no.

12:13.386 --> 12:15.488
You get payment when
you deliver information,

12:15.491 --> 12:16.991
which needs to happen soon.

12:16.993 --> 12:18.893
Like I said, I'ma start
doing some sniffing.

12:18.896 --> 12:21.108
Well, I'ma need you to have
a more powerful nose, then.

12:21.111 --> 12:22.979
For real, dog, like one
of them damn truffle pigs,

12:22.981 --> 12:23.992
'cause me and my partner

12:23.995 --> 12:25.484
already $500 in the hole, homie.

12:25.487 --> 12:27.559
Your partner knows I
always deliver gold.

12:27.562 --> 12:30.371
That don't got nothing
to do with me, though.

12:30.373 --> 12:32.339
It's been too long of a
day for this crap, man.

12:32.341 --> 12:34.077
Yeah.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.876
This apartment's just part of my cover,

12:35.878 --> 12:37.653
you know what I mean? It's
not how I usually roll.

12:37.655 --> 12:39.113
Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

12:39.115 --> 12:40.381
Ray.

12:40.383 --> 12:42.183
Get the information!

12:51.424 --> 12:52.893
Hey.

12:52.895 --> 12:54.261
Hey. Good to see you.

13:02.296 --> 13:03.370
Upton.

13:03.373 --> 13:04.711
I just talked to my guy in Gangs.

13:04.714 --> 13:05.895
The stash house that got robbed today

13:05.897 --> 13:07.273
belonged to the 16th Street Boys,

13:07.276 --> 13:08.609
not the Latin Hoods.

13:08.611 --> 13:10.277
So much for the inside job theory.

13:10.279 --> 13:12.113
Yeah, which puts us back to square one.

13:12.115 --> 13:14.949
All right, my CI's got
intel on two Hispanic bangers

13:14.951 --> 13:16.217
moving product out of a house

13:16.219 --> 13:17.422
on 47th and Racine.

13:17.425 --> 13:19.153
- Cobra label.
- Get a warrant.

13:19.155 --> 13:20.888
We don't need a
warrant. House is vacant.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.223
Let's hit it.

13:43.746 --> 13:45.620
Go.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.573
Chicago PD!

13:51.053 --> 13:52.081
Hey!

13:52.084 --> 13:53.488
- Hey!
- Hey!

13:53.491 --> 13:55.300
Stop right there! Chicago PD!

13:55.303 --> 13:56.953
Hey, l... hey, hey! Chicago PD!

13:56.956 --> 13:57.868
- Hey!
- Ah!

13:57.871 --> 13:59.691
Come on, let me go!
I didn't do anything!

13:59.694 --> 14:01.478
- We didn't do nothing!
- You stay right there!

14:01.480 --> 14:03.196
You stay right there! Don't you move!

14:03.199 --> 14:04.472
So, Antonio, you got me?

14:04.475 --> 14:05.606
- I got you.
- Come on, don't shoot.

14:05.608 --> 14:06.574
Don't shoot.

14:06.577 --> 14:08.297
- Get on your knees.
- Where are the drugs?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.037
- We ain't got no drugs!
- Where are the drugs?

14:10.039 --> 14:11.493
We ain't got no drugs.
Get out of my face.

14:11.495 --> 14:12.560
These the drugs?

14:12.563 --> 14:13.727
That's legal.

14:13.730 --> 14:14.975
Get him out of here.

14:14.977 --> 14:16.566
Let's go.

14:16.569 --> 14:18.970
The heroin is here somewhere.
Let's tear this place apart.

14:18.973 --> 14:20.548
Jay, you guys good back there?

14:20.550 --> 14:22.535
Yeah, we're good out here.

14:22.538 --> 14:24.038
Other hand.

14:30.215 --> 14:31.882
I got something.

14:33.788 --> 14:36.221
Typical go-to trap.

14:36.224 --> 14:38.058
Like Denza says,

14:38.061 --> 14:40.122
he delivers gold.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.392
All right.

14:44.177 --> 14:45.528
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

14:45.531 --> 14:47.053
I ran the two offenders, Miguel Soto

14:47.056 --> 14:48.520
- and Juan Fernandez.
- Yeah.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.575
They both have priors for possession.

14:50.578 --> 14:52.349
Hey, you recover any weapons?

14:52.352 --> 14:54.370
No, there was no guns.
Techs are still on the scene.

14:54.372 --> 14:55.568
They're looking for blood and hair.

14:55.570 --> 14:57.372
- So far, nothing.
- Any gunshot residue?

14:57.375 --> 14:58.537
Negative, but it's been a while,

14:58.539 --> 15:00.661
so doesn't mean anything.

15:00.664 --> 15:02.497
The good news is, the heroin we found...

15:02.500 --> 15:05.668
It's a match. It's
got the cobra insignia.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.572
Hailey, get the little
boy's mother down here.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.815
See if she can make a positive ID.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.784
All right, Jay, you
and Kim talk to Soto.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.719
You two take a run at Fernandez.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.844
Bro, I need you to take point for a bit.

15:15.847 --> 15:17.213
- Cool?
- Everything all right?

15:17.216 --> 15:19.226
Yeah, just got some
stuff I need to handle.

15:21.604 --> 15:23.896
I'm telling you, man, if we
were holding that much dope,

15:23.898 --> 15:25.196
we wouldn't be laying up in that dump.

15:25.198 --> 15:26.851
Yeah, the law says your house,

15:26.854 --> 15:28.267
- your dope.
- It's not my house.

15:28.269 --> 15:29.201
We was just crashing there.

15:29.203 --> 15:30.180
I'd be crashing there too

15:30.182 --> 15:31.470
if I just killed three people,

15:31.473 --> 15:32.606
including a little kid.

15:32.609 --> 15:34.073
We ain't got nothing to do with that.

15:34.075 --> 15:35.776
Where were you this afternoon?

15:35.779 --> 15:37.743
I was having a beer with my
carnal at the house.

15:37.745 --> 15:39.515
Right, at the house that isn't yours,

15:39.518 --> 15:40.970
with the drugs that you
didn't know were there.

15:40.972 --> 15:42.414
- That's right.
- "That's right."

15:42.416 --> 15:44.783
"That's right."

15:44.785 --> 15:46.720
You got anybody who can verify that?

15:50.016 --> 15:51.348
We're alone.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.018
Just me and him, drinking cervezas.

15:53.021 --> 15:54.485
I know you're trying
to hang this dead kid

15:54.487 --> 15:55.961
on me and my boy,

15:55.963 --> 15:57.981
- but we're clean.
- You ran, G.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.483
That's usually what guilty people do.

15:59.486 --> 16:00.686
Come on, man. Somebody comes to the door

16:00.688 --> 16:01.767
without knocking, it usually ain't

16:01.769 --> 16:03.403
a friendly visit.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.879
This is Felix.

16:13.881 --> 16:17.650
He's ten years old.

16:17.652 --> 16:19.200
He lived in an apartment

16:19.203 --> 16:20.819
down the hallway

16:20.821 --> 16:21.820
from the stash house.

16:21.822 --> 16:22.821
He caught a stray bullet

16:22.823 --> 16:25.324
in the head.

16:25.326 --> 16:26.911
He was taking a nap.

16:31.799 --> 16:35.701
What could possibly be funny?

16:35.703 --> 16:37.569
Nothing. Nothing's funny, man.

16:37.571 --> 16:40.472
Nothing? Nothing?

16:40.474 --> 16:42.466
I want to know.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.783
You want to know what's funny?

16:43.786 --> 16:45.477
I do. Please.

16:45.479 --> 16:47.713
What's funny is a Chicago cop

16:47.715 --> 16:50.350
pretending to care about a Mexican boy.

16:55.990 --> 16:57.606
Hey! Hey, man!

16:57.609 --> 16:58.684
Get off me, man!

16:58.687 --> 17:00.427
- Hey, you can't do this!
- No?

17:00.430 --> 17:02.860
Ah, get your boy! Get your boy, man!

17:02.863 --> 17:04.363
- Hey, you can't do this!
- Hey, man.

17:04.365 --> 17:05.858
Hey! Get your man!

17:05.862 --> 17:06.861
Hey, let him go.

17:06.864 --> 17:09.114
Ah, you can't do this!

17:09.117 --> 17:11.282
Ruz, let him go.

17:13.340 --> 17:15.273
He gonna get his.

17:24.512 --> 17:25.845
We're gonna leave these here

17:25.848 --> 17:27.548
for you,

17:27.550 --> 17:29.384
so you can keep laughing.

17:35.861 --> 17:37.544
So where are we at?

17:37.547 --> 17:39.205
Both dudes are sticking to the script.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.632
They got nothing to do with the rips,

17:40.634 --> 17:42.020
- the murders.
- Alibi?

17:42.023 --> 17:44.041
Drinking beer in the abandoned house.

17:44.044 --> 17:45.661
Hey. I just talked

17:45.664 --> 17:47.802
with Sarah Montero, Felix's mom.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.775
I showed her a photo
array of our suspects.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.377
- Get a positive ID?
- No.

17:51.379 --> 17:52.372
Nobody familiar.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.056
So either she didn't get a good look,

17:54.059 --> 17:55.647
or these aren't our guys.

17:55.649 --> 17:57.649
My money's on choice B.

17:57.651 --> 17:58.895
Choice B? Why?

17:58.898 --> 18:00.451
So I just checked out the store

18:00.454 --> 18:02.188
the guys said they got their beer from.

18:02.191 --> 18:04.524
Timestamped 9:33 a.m.

18:04.527 --> 18:07.094
Stash house was hit at 9:36 a.m.

18:07.097 --> 18:09.860
So it's a 20-minute drive
if they hit every green light

18:09.863 --> 18:11.596
and no traffic.

18:11.599 --> 18:14.533
We got the wrong guys.

18:14.535 --> 18:16.403
Who the hell gave you the intel?

18:28.382 --> 18:29.849
Hey!

18:29.852 --> 18:31.550
Kind of game you playing here, Ray?

18:31.552 --> 18:32.885
Now what are you talking about, man?

18:32.887 --> 18:34.486
You deliver gold, right? Yeah?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.888
You deliver fool's gold!

18:35.890 --> 18:37.900
Those two guys you put me
onto... they're innocent.

18:37.903 --> 18:40.260
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

18:40.263 --> 18:42.369
- They have airtight alibis!
- Well, I'm sorry.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.662
Look, I was just passing along info.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.950
Where'd you get the info from?

18:44.953 --> 18:46.721
From a junkie. He knows the neighborhood

18:46.724 --> 18:47.495
- inside and out.
- You gave me

18:47.497 --> 18:48.898
- a tip from a junkie?
- Of course I did!

18:48.900 --> 18:50.768
Where else would I get
it, a heart surgeon?

18:50.771 --> 18:52.700
How'd the heroin get in the house?

18:52.703 --> 18:54.740
Well, maybe they bought
it from the real rip crew.

18:54.742 --> 18:57.509
Why the hell would I know?

19:00.748 --> 19:02.614
No more weak-ass info.

19:02.616 --> 19:04.283
All right?

19:04.285 --> 19:06.470
You put me in a real
bad spot with all this.

19:06.473 --> 19:08.684
Let me get this straight.
I put you in a bad spot?

19:08.687 --> 19:09.953
- Yeah?
- Huh?

19:09.956 --> 19:11.422
What is that, some kind of joke?

19:12.893 --> 19:14.315
Dude, don't put that on me.

19:14.318 --> 19:16.318
All you had to do was testify.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.820
You could've covered my back!

19:17.823 --> 19:18.823
I didn't see the shooting.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.040
All you had to do

19:20.043 --> 19:22.033
was saw that you saw
him reach for his pistol.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.635
I was a block away.

19:23.637 --> 19:25.064
I didn't see a damn thing.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.638
All I heard was gunshots.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.043
IAD would've figured out.

19:28.046 --> 19:29.212
It would've hurt you.

19:29.215 --> 19:30.364
- Hurt me?
- Yeah!

19:30.367 --> 19:31.966
Well, look at me, homie.

19:31.969 --> 19:34.979
I'm not exactly rolling
in high cotton, am I here?

19:34.982 --> 19:36.582
I'm trying to help you out.

19:36.584 --> 19:37.697
Give you work.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.220
You're giving me pity.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.157
All right, you know what, then?

19:45.159 --> 19:47.326
We can end this arrangement right now.

19:47.328 --> 19:48.660
Go our separate ways.

19:50.507 --> 19:51.506
No, I'm good.

19:51.509 --> 19:52.909
I'm just...

19:52.912 --> 19:54.466
I'm sorry, all right?

19:54.468 --> 19:55.564
Let me get back out there,

19:55.567 --> 19:56.568
let me shake up some bushes,

19:56.570 --> 19:58.043
and I'll make this right.

19:58.046 --> 19:59.178
Yeah?

19:59.181 --> 20:00.447
No charge this time.

20:07.615 --> 20:08.681
All right.

20:16.490 --> 20:18.357
Boss.

20:18.359 --> 20:19.619
Uh, yeah, it's me.

20:19.622 --> 20:21.960
Uh, listen. I want to apologize to you.

20:21.962 --> 20:23.262
All right, what happened?

20:23.264 --> 20:24.863
My CI... He got bad info

20:24.866 --> 20:26.521
from somebody he trusted,

20:26.524 --> 20:28.291
but he's going to make it up to me.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.560
- I'm on him.
- Copy.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.025
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

20:50.691 --> 20:52.958
My name is Ruben. I'm an addict.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.127
Hi, Ruben.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.563
I'm, uh, also a father.

20:57.565 --> 21:00.699
Got a nine-year-old daughter.

21:00.701 --> 21:02.197
I've been sober for 14 months

21:02.200 --> 21:04.098
and six days,

21:04.101 --> 21:05.671
and, uh,

21:05.673 --> 21:09.308
after all those years of being absent,

21:09.310 --> 21:10.976
being high,

21:10.978 --> 21:12.644
my daughter and my wife

21:12.646 --> 21:15.247
have let me back into their lives.

21:15.249 --> 21:17.483
I'm so blessed they've
given me another chance

21:17.485 --> 21:18.832
to be the husband and father

21:18.835 --> 21:21.369
I know, deep down, I really am,

21:21.372 --> 21:23.572
and their faith in me

21:23.575 --> 21:25.757
makes life worth living,

21:25.759 --> 21:27.556
and helps me battle

21:27.559 --> 21:29.754
this cruel and unforgiving disease.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.701
Thanks!

21:34.704 --> 21:37.344
Just talked to the gang
unit. No chatter, no leads.

21:37.347 --> 21:38.647
Nothing from the crime lab, either.

21:38.649 --> 21:39.945
There's gotta be some link,

21:39.948 --> 21:41.047
something that connects

21:41.050 --> 21:42.388
these three rips to each other.

21:42.391 --> 21:44.151
I just talked to a fed at HIDTA.

21:44.153 --> 21:46.153
Think I have a connection.

21:46.155 --> 21:47.855
Turns out Marino's narcotics squad

21:47.857 --> 21:49.190
had sealed search warrants

21:49.192 --> 21:50.991
for each of the three stash houses,

21:50.993 --> 21:52.193
but somehow, the rip crew

21:52.195 --> 21:53.472
was able to hit the stash houses

21:53.474 --> 21:55.260
before the search
warrants were executed.

21:55.263 --> 21:56.831
You're saying someone
tipped the rip crews off?

21:56.833 --> 21:58.132
I'm saying the rip crew knew exactly

21:58.134 --> 21:59.467
where the stash houses were

21:59.469 --> 22:00.801
and that they were loaded with product.

22:00.803 --> 22:03.070
Because of the search warrants.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.673
We got a dirty cop in Narcotics.

22:05.675 --> 22:09.510
Yeah.

22:09.512 --> 22:11.512
Hey. Hey, Kenny.

22:11.514 --> 22:12.648
Thanks for coming in early.

22:12.651 --> 22:14.014
No problem.

22:14.016 --> 22:15.789
I'm guessing this isn't a social visit.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.851
Wish it was.

22:16.853 --> 22:20.020
Come on, let's take a walk.

22:20.022 --> 22:23.357
Tell me, what the hell is going on?

22:23.359 --> 22:25.860
Well, we think someone in your squad

22:25.862 --> 22:29.287
is leaking warrant
intel to the rip crew.

22:29.290 --> 22:31.457
Listen, Hank, you come to
me with something like that,

22:31.460 --> 22:33.359
you better not think
that. You better know it.

22:33.362 --> 22:35.503
Well, here's one thing I know.

22:35.505 --> 22:38.433
Last few months, your shop
has more negative warrants

22:38.436 --> 22:40.135
than any other squad in the city.

22:40.138 --> 22:41.789
That's because we did more warrants.

22:41.792 --> 22:44.542
Or it's because the rip crew
got there before you did.

22:44.545 --> 22:46.311
Here's another thing we know.

22:46.314 --> 22:48.214
Look, the three rips
we're putting on this crew,

22:48.217 --> 22:49.817
where bodies were dropped,

22:49.819 --> 22:51.485
they happened

22:51.487 --> 22:53.287
while search warrants
were being drawn up

22:53.289 --> 22:55.601
by your guys on those very spots.

22:55.604 --> 22:57.191
They knew exactly when the stash houses

22:57.193 --> 22:59.727
would be fat with product,
and there'd be no eyes on them.

22:59.729 --> 23:01.297
Come on, look, huh? We
all know that there's lots

23:01.299 --> 23:03.197
of way for the intel to get
to the rippers, all right?

23:03.199 --> 23:04.782
Somebody in the courts,
the ASA's office...

23:04.784 --> 23:06.333
Listen, listen. The problem is,

23:06.335 --> 23:08.168
there were different
ASAs on each warrant,

23:08.170 --> 23:09.359
and the judge was different

23:09.362 --> 23:11.238
on two of the three cases.

23:11.240 --> 23:16.557
The only common denominator
here is your squad.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.116
It is what it is.

23:22.885 --> 23:25.185
All right, so what's the play?

23:25.187 --> 23:27.354
Set up a stash house.

23:27.356 --> 23:29.556
I mean, you tell your guys
you got some good intel

23:29.558 --> 23:32.226
but the drugs won't be there long,

23:32.229 --> 23:34.054
so you need an emergency warrant.

23:34.057 --> 23:36.312
And if the rip crew
shows, we take them down,

23:36.315 --> 23:38.466
and figure out who's behind the leak.

24:01.724 --> 24:03.891
Right, let me know when everyone's cozy.

24:05.795 --> 24:07.261
Copy that.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.476
Talked to Jimmy O'Shea

24:22.478 --> 24:25.746
down in the pension
station this morning.

24:25.748 --> 24:29.283
Mm-hmm?

24:29.285 --> 24:31.985
Anything you want to tell me, Al?

24:31.987 --> 24:34.995
No, it's not what you think.

24:34.998 --> 24:36.487
Well, you put your papers in.

24:36.490 --> 24:37.549
Seems...

24:37.552 --> 24:38.932
pretty black and white to me.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.594
I'm not looking to pull the pin.

24:40.596 --> 24:43.230
I'm just seeing where
Internal Affairs is.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.599
Little canary-in-the-coal-mine
kind of thing.

24:45.601 --> 24:47.134
Application gets flagged, then we know

24:47.136 --> 24:48.669
the case they're building is real.

24:50.177 --> 24:51.305
Boss, we're all set.

24:51.307 --> 24:52.439
Me, too.

24:52.441 --> 24:54.132
In position, nice and cozy.

24:54.135 --> 24:56.176
Right, what about you, Jay?

24:56.178 --> 24:58.312
Yeah, I'm good to go.

24:58.314 --> 25:01.281
Copy that.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.128
Catching Gilbright dirty is gonna be...

25:14.130 --> 25:16.296
It's gonna be tough.

25:16.298 --> 25:19.433
I mean, he's been sober over a year.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.201
There's no sign he's using.

25:21.203 --> 25:23.137
He's got a daughter, job.

25:23.139 --> 25:25.873
So? We improvise.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.879
Guy's trying to go clean, Al.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.786
Hey, we'll find another way out of this.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.388
We'll figure it out.

25:46.729 --> 25:49.696
Got two male Hispanics,
20s, dark clothing.

25:49.698 --> 25:51.362
Look like they're wearing ski masks.

25:51.365 --> 25:53.000
One of them's got
something in his pocket.

25:53.002 --> 25:54.234
These are our guys.

25:58.841 --> 26:01.341
We wait for them to hit that door.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.924
Hailey, you say when.

26:21.076 --> 26:22.362
Not yet.

26:22.364 --> 26:24.031
Hang tough.

26:41.217 --> 26:42.382
Ah!

26:42.384 --> 26:44.213
Police! Drop your weapons!

26:55.130 --> 26:57.297
- You good?
- Good!

26:59.902 --> 27:01.235
Hey.

27:01.237 --> 27:02.870
Everybody okay?

27:02.872 --> 27:05.439
All good.

27:05.441 --> 27:07.500
Guy inside is down.
He's not getting back up,

27:07.503 --> 27:10.577
not ever.

27:10.579 --> 27:12.646
This one's still alive.

27:12.648 --> 27:14.314
5021 George. Shots fired by the police.

27:14.316 --> 27:16.483
Roll an ambo to 3627 West 47th Street.

27:16.485 --> 27:17.751
We got multiple offenders down.

27:17.753 --> 27:20.888
Copy that, 5021 George.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.290
Okay, so this Maldonado...
Is he gonna live?

27:23.292 --> 27:24.409
We don't know yet, sarge.

27:24.412 --> 27:25.878
Soon as he's done with surgery at Med,

27:25.880 --> 27:27.143
Jay and Upton will let us know.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.494
Maldonado's weapon is a match

27:28.497 --> 27:29.663
to the Beretta 380

27:29.665 --> 27:30.898
that killed the little boy, Felix,

27:30.900 --> 27:32.332
so we're pretty positive

27:32.334 --> 27:33.667
these are the guys doing the rips.

27:33.669 --> 27:34.968
All right, what about their apartment?

27:34.970 --> 27:36.114
- We search it?
- Yeah, and we found

27:36.116 --> 27:38.004
30 grand in cash and
three keys of heroin,

27:38.007 --> 27:39.273
and the brand matches the one

27:39.275 --> 27:41.441
taken from the last stash house, Cobra.

27:41.443 --> 27:43.126
Okay, so we got the rippers.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.829
We just got to figure out
who they're working with.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.280
I got a lead on that, too.

27:46.282 --> 27:48.782
Did some digging with the OCD techs.

27:48.784 --> 27:50.245
Uh-huh.

27:54.023 --> 27:55.878
You sure about this?

28:02.498 --> 28:04.963
Look, all I see here is paper.

28:04.966 --> 28:06.632
Well, that paper don't lie.

28:06.635 --> 28:08.802
There's a pattern of queries
on your OCD admin terminal

28:08.804 --> 28:10.637
for warrants generated by your squad

28:10.639 --> 28:12.105
that later turned up negative.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.473
And each and every login

28:13.475 --> 28:17.477
comes from the exact same person.

28:17.479 --> 28:19.646
This... this... this
doesn't make any sense.

28:19.648 --> 28:21.281
Kenny, she was logging into cases

28:21.283 --> 28:22.549
her team wasn't involved with.

28:22.551 --> 28:24.315
It's all right here in the folder.

28:31.694 --> 28:33.393
Just make sure

28:33.395 --> 28:36.330
you give her a fair shake.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.449
I will. You have my word.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.338
Excuse me, Detective Rojas.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.007
Can you come in here a minute, please?

28:49.378 --> 28:51.065
Come on in.

28:53.215 --> 28:54.881
Thank you.

28:54.883 --> 28:56.750
Sergeant Voight and Detective Dawson

28:56.752 --> 28:58.495
just want to go over
a few things with you.

28:58.498 --> 29:00.431
Yeah, you want to have a seat?

29:00.434 --> 29:01.768
No, I'm good.

29:03.592 --> 29:06.526
Well, we caught that
rip crew a few hours ago.

29:06.528 --> 29:08.028
One that killed a little boy.

29:08.030 --> 29:10.263
I heard. Congratulations.

29:10.265 --> 29:11.784
Thank you, but, uh,

29:11.787 --> 29:13.802
case isn't closed.

29:13.805 --> 29:17.007
Turns out they're
working with someone else.

29:17.010 --> 29:19.237
Yeah, someone was feeding these guys

29:19.240 --> 29:21.371
intel on the stash houses.

29:21.374 --> 29:23.109
You ever have any previous dealing

29:23.112 --> 29:25.078
with these two punks?

29:25.080 --> 29:27.280
Gutierrez?

29:27.282 --> 29:28.706
Maldonado?

29:28.709 --> 29:30.375
No, never.

29:30.378 --> 29:32.948
You know anyone who runs with these two?

29:32.951 --> 29:34.695
Wait, what the hell is this?

29:34.698 --> 29:35.932
It's just a conversation.

29:35.935 --> 29:37.901
Conversation, my ass.

29:37.904 --> 29:39.226
You saying I'm a dirty cop.

29:39.229 --> 29:41.928
Are you?

29:43.365 --> 29:44.979
I don't care who you are,

29:44.982 --> 29:46.348
or what your rank is,

29:46.351 --> 29:48.434
you say that out loud
again, I'm coming for you.

29:49.805 --> 29:51.571
So either slap on the bracelets,

29:51.573 --> 29:54.908
or I'm walking the hell out of here.

29:57.312 --> 29:59.579
I didn't think so.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.833
Everything we have points to Rojas,

30:10.836 --> 30:12.516
and no one else in Marino's crew.

30:12.518 --> 30:14.285
A'ight, before we can move on her,

30:14.287 --> 30:15.963
we got to find a firm connection

30:15.966 --> 30:18.055
with either Maldonado or Gutierrez.

30:18.057 --> 30:19.224
Well, we dug deep, boss.

30:19.227 --> 30:20.927
Computer forensics saw nothing unusual.

30:20.930 --> 30:22.958
No common numbers between her phone

30:22.961 --> 30:24.761
and the burners that we
pulled off those guys.

30:24.764 --> 30:27.364
I mean, she's basically the
rising star of narcotics, Sarge.

30:27.366 --> 30:28.966
Her disciplinary report is perfect.

30:28.968 --> 30:30.367
Highly decorated. I don't see

30:30.369 --> 30:31.468
any irregular bank deposits

30:31.470 --> 30:32.521
or anything that shows

30:32.524 --> 30:33.583
she's living above her means.

30:33.585 --> 30:34.585
Well, she is one of us. She knows

30:34.587 --> 30:35.638
how to cover her tracks.

30:35.641 --> 30:36.732
Okay, if that's the case,

30:36.735 --> 30:38.067
why would she be careless enough

30:38.070 --> 30:39.809
to log into the OCD admin terminal

30:39.812 --> 30:41.146
with her own code?

30:41.149 --> 30:42.813
Forget about getting
anything out of Maldonado.

30:42.815 --> 30:44.752
ME's got a toe tag with his name on it.

30:44.755 --> 30:47.599
Hold on. I might have something.

30:47.602 --> 30:49.786
A frequent call made from the land line

30:49.789 --> 30:51.789
at Maldonado's apartment
comes back to his cousin,

30:51.791 --> 30:52.919
"Big Frank" Bennett.

30:52.922 --> 30:54.088
He's out on bail, awaiting trial

30:54.090 --> 30:55.292
on a distribution charge.

30:55.294 --> 30:56.661
Might be a long shot,

30:56.664 --> 30:58.628
but maybe he was unloading
product for his cousin.

30:58.631 --> 31:01.131
Means he could've met
Rojas along the way.

31:01.133 --> 31:03.000
Let's chase it.

31:05.671 --> 31:06.837
Right there.

31:09.789 --> 31:12.111
There.

31:17.587 --> 31:20.521
Stop.

31:38.771 --> 31:39.814
Chicago PD!

31:39.817 --> 31:41.900
- Let me see your hands!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!

31:41.903 --> 31:43.654
- Don't shoot me!
- Put your hands on your head.

31:43.656 --> 31:44.695
- I didn't do nothing, man.
- Put 'em on your head!

31:44.697 --> 31:45.945
- Come on.
- Lock your fingers!

31:45.948 --> 31:47.214
All right, all right!

31:47.217 --> 31:48.978
Come on, man. I didn't do nothing.

31:50.516 --> 31:52.216
Come on, none of that
stuff belongs to me.

31:52.218 --> 31:54.785
It does now.

31:54.787 --> 31:55.853
Man.

31:55.855 --> 31:57.221
And they say crime doesn't pay.

31:57.223 --> 31:58.655
- Just take it.
- What?

31:58.657 --> 31:59.794
I'll make believe you guys weren't here.

31:59.796 --> 32:01.325
I'm gonna make believe
you didn't say that.

32:01.327 --> 32:02.893
I got one question.

32:02.895 --> 32:04.728
Don't get it wrong.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.730
Who was feeding your
cousin the stash houses?

32:06.732 --> 32:07.896
I don't know.

32:07.899 --> 32:09.169
You listen to me.

32:09.172 --> 32:10.868
A ten-year-old boy caught
a bullet to the head

32:10.870 --> 32:12.100
because of that crap you were flushing,

32:12.102 --> 32:13.636
so you, my friend, are looking at

32:13.639 --> 32:15.239
- a felony murder charge.
- Come on.

32:15.241 --> 32:17.040
Last chance to help yourself.

32:17.042 --> 32:18.475
I'm not gonna ask again.

32:22.481 --> 32:25.182
Look, all I know is
that it's a dirty cop.

32:26.719 --> 32:28.919
They would meet at
some bar named Nemo's.

32:35.528 --> 32:37.895
Footage is on a 72-hour loop,

32:37.897 --> 32:40.531
but those guys were definitely
in here two nights ago.

32:40.533 --> 32:42.032
Okay, what about her?

32:42.034 --> 32:43.434
Was she with them?

32:43.436 --> 32:45.057
Mm, I'm not sure.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.004
We were slammed.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.006
Hold on. There they go.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.107
Right there.

32:51.444 --> 32:53.076
Can you fast-forward
beyond this, please?

32:56.048 --> 32:57.181
Hold up.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.782
Stop.

32:58.784 --> 33:00.284
Zoom in on that back table.

33:03.255 --> 33:04.788
Denza.

33:08.627 --> 33:11.595
Hey, it's a simple question.

33:11.597 --> 33:13.597
Were you giving Ray Denza information

33:13.599 --> 33:15.399
about suspected drug locations?

33:15.401 --> 33:16.867
What does Ray have to do with this?

33:16.869 --> 33:18.302
- Oh, my...
- He was hanging out in Nemo's

33:18.304 --> 33:19.536
with Maldonado and Gutierrez

33:19.538 --> 33:20.804
the night before the last rip.

33:20.806 --> 33:22.494
Denza? You sure about that?

33:22.497 --> 33:24.374
Yeah. We got it on video.

33:24.376 --> 33:25.963
Look, I'm guessing it's
just a matter of time

33:25.965 --> 33:26.934
before he gives you up.

33:26.937 --> 33:28.545
Guys, I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:28.547 --> 33:30.268
Denza's number's all over your phone!

33:30.271 --> 33:32.546
Boss says you were paying
him for information.

33:32.549 --> 33:33.978
I use him as a CI.

33:33.981 --> 33:35.552
He-he... he's broke,

33:35.554 --> 33:37.154
so I helped him out, but that's it.

33:37.156 --> 33:38.755
Okay, so help us out.

33:38.757 --> 33:40.057
Help us understand why somebody

33:40.059 --> 33:41.425
logged into the OCD database

33:41.427 --> 33:43.227
using your code, your password.

33:45.130 --> 33:46.997
How's that happen?

33:50.936 --> 33:53.937
Son of a bitch.

33:56.108 --> 33:59.009
He played me.

33:59.011 --> 34:00.310
Played you how?

34:00.312 --> 34:02.646
God.

34:02.648 --> 34:05.439
I let him crash at my
place for a few days.

34:05.442 --> 34:06.984
I even gave him a key.

34:06.986 --> 34:09.033
So you're saying he stole
your computer password?

34:09.036 --> 34:10.954
That's the only thing that makes sense,

34:10.956 --> 34:12.610
'cause I didn't leak a damn thing.

34:12.614 --> 34:14.958
On my baby girl.

34:23.702 --> 34:25.416
No wonder he gave me bad information.

34:25.418 --> 34:28.338
He's the one who planted
the heroin in the house.

34:28.340 --> 34:30.206
How'd I not see that?

34:30.208 --> 34:31.475
Trying to help a brother out.

34:31.476 --> 34:33.976
Yeah, like an idiot.

34:36.849 --> 34:38.514
- Where is he?
- He's gone!

34:38.516 --> 34:39.708
Where the hell is he? Ray!

34:39.710 --> 34:41.924
I don't know, I swear!
Okay, he came this morning.

34:41.927 --> 34:43.036
He was all freaked out.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.054
He packed a bag and said
he's never coming back.

34:49.341 --> 34:51.100
So you don't know where
he is or how to find him?

34:51.101 --> 34:52.590
No, I don't know. He just left.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.893
You understand, as soon as the cartel

34:53.895 --> 34:54.927
finds out who's behind this,

34:54.929 --> 34:56.553
they're gonna hang
your man under a bridge

34:56.554 --> 34:57.896
unless you help us find him.

34:57.899 --> 34:59.592
Ray is a grown-ass man, okay?

34:59.595 --> 35:01.594
He's got to live with
the decisions he's made.

35:01.597 --> 35:02.863
That's cold as hell.

35:02.865 --> 35:04.031
I'm just telling you how it is.

35:04.033 --> 35:05.432
You know, Crystal, I know you think

35:05.434 --> 35:06.698
you can tie this off, move on,

35:06.701 --> 35:07.801
find another dude,

35:07.803 --> 35:09.159
but I'm here to tell you,

35:09.162 --> 35:10.371
it's not that simple.

35:10.373 --> 35:12.681
You see, you've been helping
a drug dealer and a murderer.

35:12.684 --> 35:14.417
Which means that you stand down to face

35:14.420 --> 35:15.710
felony conspiracy charges.

35:15.713 --> 35:16.979
You understand that?

35:16.982 --> 35:19.093
- It's like that, huh?
- You know what?

35:19.096 --> 35:20.363
You think we're playing with you?

35:20.365 --> 35:21.599
- Because we not.
- Come on with us.

35:21.601 --> 35:22.690
Come on.

35:22.693 --> 35:24.451
- Let's go.
- Wait.

35:24.453 --> 35:27.955
His grandfather has a boat
in a boatyard in Chinatown.

35:27.957 --> 35:29.390
He keeps it there in the winter.

35:29.392 --> 35:31.318
Ray sleeps there sometimes.

35:33.062 --> 35:35.797
- You telling the truth?
- Yes.

35:41.237 --> 35:43.037
Yeah, copy that, boss.

35:43.039 --> 35:47.341
We'll sit tight. A'ight.

35:47.343 --> 35:48.438
Don't get too comfortable.

35:48.441 --> 35:49.440
They're ten minutes out.

35:49.443 --> 35:51.412
Copy that.

35:55.418 --> 35:58.085
Hey, there he goes.

36:04.894 --> 36:07.227
We can't let him get in that car, dog.

36:23.879 --> 36:26.447
Go right. Go right!

36:49.271 --> 36:50.604
Ray!

37:12.704 --> 37:13.901
Ray!

37:16.665 --> 37:18.265
You know the drill.

37:18.267 --> 37:20.089
Nice and easy. Keep your hands

37:20.092 --> 37:21.101
where I can see them.

37:21.103 --> 37:22.336
Come on, Adam. It's
not even what you think.

37:22.338 --> 37:23.737
Just turn around and look the other way.

37:23.739 --> 37:25.143
Let me go. You never see me again,

37:25.146 --> 37:26.774
I swear. We'll call it even!

37:26.776 --> 37:29.076
Get on your knees.

37:29.078 --> 37:31.662
It was just bad guys killing bad guys.

37:31.665 --> 37:33.432
Yeah? What about the kid?

37:33.435 --> 37:34.701
He was ten years old!

37:34.704 --> 37:36.683
That's not my fault! You and I both know

37:36.685 --> 37:38.404
bullets don't got no names on them!

37:38.407 --> 37:40.154
No, Ray.

37:40.156 --> 37:41.989
It's over.

37:41.991 --> 37:43.791
Get on your knees.

37:43.793 --> 37:45.426
Get on your knees!

37:47.696 --> 37:49.863
A'ight, you're right.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.005
It is over.

37:52.701 --> 37:54.005
Yo, don't get stupid.

37:54.008 --> 37:55.369
Stop walking at me.

37:55.371 --> 37:56.503
Ray.

37:56.505 --> 37:57.654
Let me see your hands!

37:57.657 --> 37:59.506
You can see my hands.

37:59.508 --> 38:01.518
But what you can't see is my gun.

38:01.521 --> 38:02.787
Don't do this.

38:02.790 --> 38:05.379
- Do what? Huh?
- Ray, don't play with me.

38:05.381 --> 38:07.481
What if I'm bluffing?

38:07.483 --> 38:08.821
Huh, Adam?

38:08.824 --> 38:10.951
- What if there is no gun?
- No, don't do this to me!

38:10.954 --> 38:12.453
Do not make me shoot you!

38:12.455 --> 38:15.889
Don't go out like this.
It was a good shoot, Adam.

38:15.891 --> 38:18.625
Clean, by the book.

38:18.627 --> 38:19.893
I know.

38:19.895 --> 38:21.361
I saw him reach.

38:21.364 --> 38:22.263
I know.

38:22.266 --> 38:23.966
- Yeah, but nobody helped me!
- I know!

38:23.969 --> 38:25.579
Nobody cared!

38:25.582 --> 38:27.201
You want to know what the kicker is?

38:27.204 --> 38:28.327
Ray...

38:28.330 --> 38:29.529
- In jail...
- Ray!

38:29.532 --> 38:31.154
- I'm still a cop.
- Ray!

38:31.157 --> 38:32.774
Which means I'm a dead man!

38:32.777 --> 38:34.584
- I won't last a day...
- Ray, I will shoot you!

38:34.586 --> 38:36.451
How's that for some ironic bullshit?

38:40.483 --> 38:41.748
Stay down.

38:43.752 --> 38:46.492
No gun. No gun, you son of a bitch.

38:46.495 --> 38:48.722
Why didn't you just shoot me, man?

38:48.724 --> 38:50.424
- Why?
- Get up.

38:50.426 --> 38:52.659
Get up!

38:52.661 --> 38:54.495
You should've just shot me, man.

38:58.522 --> 39:00.501
You shoulda just shot me, man!

39:11.978 --> 39:13.978
Hey, what's up with Olinsky?

39:13.981 --> 39:15.548
What do you mean?

39:15.551 --> 39:18.452
A confidential letter
came across my desk

39:18.454 --> 39:21.121
for the commander's eyes only.

39:21.123 --> 39:23.457
I'm a policeman. I'm naturally curious.

39:23.459 --> 39:26.827
Alvin's pension got flagged.

39:26.829 --> 39:28.562
You know why?

39:31.166 --> 39:33.100
Hank?

39:33.102 --> 39:34.972
Oh, come on. It's me.

39:39.007 --> 39:40.507
Look, I'm sorry, Trudy. I can't.

39:40.509 --> 39:41.776
I can't.

39:46.014 --> 39:47.782
Okay.

40:07.269 --> 40:08.766
Chicago PD! Let me see your hands!

40:08.769 --> 40:10.270
Get 'em up! Get 'em up high!

40:10.272 --> 40:11.271
Wait, w-what's going on?

40:11.273 --> 40:12.606
What is this?

40:12.608 --> 40:14.708
I'm here to pick up my daughter!

40:14.710 --> 40:16.209
What did I do?

40:16.211 --> 40:17.210
What you got on you?

40:17.212 --> 40:18.678
Nothing!

40:18.680 --> 40:20.147
Look what I found.

40:20.149 --> 40:22.282
What's going on? Ruben.

40:22.284 --> 40:23.650
- Get her.
- No!

40:23.652 --> 40:25.257
- No, that's not mine!
- What's going on?

40:25.260 --> 40:26.360
No, you guys planted it there!

40:26.362 --> 40:27.555
One of you planted it there!

40:27.558 --> 40:29.456
This is not happening! Ruben?

40:29.458 --> 40:31.224
It's not mine! Kathy...

40:31.226 --> 40:32.659
You promised.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.902
- It's not mine, I swear!
- How could you?

40:34.905 --> 40:36.296
Ma'am, stay back, please.

40:42.571 --> 40:43.970
Ugh.

40:43.972 --> 40:45.906
This is all a mistake!

40:45.908 --> 40:47.741
Kathy, that's not mine!

41:00.055 --> 41:01.488
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

41:01.490 --> 41:04.024
Here.

41:05.694 --> 41:09.396
Caught a break.

41:09.398 --> 41:11.698
Looks like Ruben started using again.

41:15.270 --> 41:17.671
Narcotics got an anonymous tip.

41:20.409 --> 41:22.676
Found half a gram of heroin in his car.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.730
Oh.

41:31.954 --> 41:34.354
Poor guy.

41:34.356 --> 41:36.389
- Tried his best, right?
- Yeah.

41:45.534 --> 41:48.068
It's not easy to outrun your demons.
