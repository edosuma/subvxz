02:08.252 --> 02:10.503
Hiya! You're always fucking
late, you, aren't you?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.631
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

02:12.757 --> 02:13.799
And you.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.050
- Come in.
- You look really good.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.969
Get in!
- Is Jamie through there?

02:17.095 --> 02:18.929
Yeah, they're in the living
room, they're all in there.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.723
- Cathy, your oven's not working.
- Don't worry about it, it'll be all right.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.892
- All right?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.690
All right?

02:30.733 --> 02:32.025
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.486
- I made a bet you'd be on time tonight.
- Sorry.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.904
- Hiya!
- Hiya.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.698
I had a late shift at work.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.741
- Well, you're here now. Beer?
- Yeah, cheers.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.785
And something to
get you started.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.079
- All right, Russ?
- All right, Johnny. How you doing?

02:44.914 --> 02:46.081
This is Damien.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.708
All right, mate?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.630
- Get that down you, warm your cockles.
- Cheers.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.552
- There you go.
- Thanks, buddy.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.558
- Here we are!

03:04.684 --> 03:08.020
There's no poppadoms,
I'm sorry, we're out.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.354
What have we got?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.565
Here, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie!

03:13.401 --> 03:15.360
Have you got a plate, Johnny?
Hold on.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.404
- We haven't got enough plates.
- We haven't got enough plates.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.240
- This is doing my head in.
- Take these off me.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.285
- Get lost.
- It's all right, we'll share.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.247
- Cath, have you got another plate?
- Another plate? Have we not got enough?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.498
No.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.292
You need one, as well. Get two.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.753
You can eat from the
packet, you'll be fine.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.465
I'll just have a small one.
- I'll have any one.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.801
Actually, you should have the
small one cos you were late.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.804
All right, this stag do,
right, I'm thinking, a few...

03:42.931 --> 03:46.016
couple of beers, go out, you
know, sambucas, all that...

03:46.142 --> 03:47.184
- strip club.
- Definitely.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.102
No, you're not
having a stripper.

03:49.229 --> 03:53.774
- No, no, no, you're not invited.
- You're not having a stripper!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.776
You've got to have a stripper.
It's traditional, isn't it?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.611
- It is traditional.
- Tradition.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.655
It's not
traditional, it's foul.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.823
I'm not going to have a stripper.
I don't see why you should.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.244
It's not foul. Get a classy one.
It's just natural - get a classy one!

04:05.370 --> 04:08.163
Russ, you wouldn't
like a stripper, would you?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.832
- I don't know, I don't...
- Yeah, he's all right with a stripper,

04:10.959 --> 04:12.584
in't you, eh?

04:13.628 --> 04:14.628
Right? So...

04:14.754 --> 04:18.130
Russ starts a little fire, nice
and cosy in the middle of the field,

04:18.257 --> 04:20.300
and before you know it these
fifth years come along

04:20.426 --> 04:22.344
and they're just adding
wood and adding wood,

04:22.470 --> 04:26.348
there's a big line of people just adding wood.
The fire is fucking massive.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.184
- The flames are higher than this house.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.394
Look, I'm not joking!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.437
- And then we are... And then...
- It's true.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.982
...any minute, we're
surrounded by police,

04:35.108 --> 04:37.234
the whole perimeter
of the entire field

04:37.360 --> 04:40.696
with those million-power
candle torches things.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.199
- And an Astra burns on, full beam,

04:44.325 --> 04:47.869
and we all scarper, you're fucking
left there stoned out your mind!

04:50.999 --> 04:53.000
You are coming on
Sunday, aren't you?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.295
You're joking?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.090
I don't think I can handle
it without you being there.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.884
I can't wait, mate.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.304
I've got Lois the
sweetest little present.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.222
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.394
That's nice. Well, of course you have -
that's why we made you the godfather.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.732
- It's nice to see you, mate.
- Yeah.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.276
You've been keeping a
low profile recently.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.611
- Mmm.
- Anything to tell?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.034
Er...

05:27.160 --> 05:30.037
Yeah, there's...
there's a promotion at work.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.080
- Ah, promotion.
- Been doing a few extra shifts.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.167
Come on, let me in, let me in,
let me in, let me in, let me in!

05:35.293 --> 05:36.585
- All right?
- All right, mate?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.712
Here, give us that.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.506
Eh? What do you reckon?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.508
You look lovely.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.428
You look lovely!
- No, you look nice.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.680
- I look like, er...

05:48.806 --> 05:51.224
Kavana!
- Kavana!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.935
- QC?
- You're always such a muppet!

05:54.062 --> 05:56.980
Give us the thing. Where is it?

05:57.106 --> 05:58.982
- Got a lighter?
- Yeah.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.609
I've gotta go, I'm knackered.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.652
Oh, I'm having a really good
night, let's keep it going.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.489
Jamie, I've got to work in the
morning, and I'm a bit stoned,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.574
- but I'll see you on Sunday.
- Yeah, all right, yeah.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.951
It'll be fun. All right?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.496
- Give my love to the little one.
- Yeah, OK, mate.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.207
- All right, mate, see ya.
- Bye, mate.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.238
- Morning. All right?

10:17.533 --> 10:20.452
- How you feeling?
- Pretty rough.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.044
Gonna give me the coffee?

10:31.255 --> 10:32.964
Thank you!

10:35.051 --> 10:36.676
Ooh! Shit.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.637
It's all right, don't
worry about it.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.306
What time do you start work?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.600
Er, 10 o'clock.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.895
- Got a bit of time, then.
- Mmm.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.022
Get back into bed.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.613
- You were pretty wasted last night.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.866
- Sorry.
- Don't have to apologise.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.785
Was I a dick?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.205
I had to save you
from the Hobbit.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.044
Don't be nasty.
He was all right.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.506
- Bit camp.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.299
Nice smile though.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.803
Is that what you go
for, a nice smile?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.346
No.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.891
Just little people.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.149
What?

11:34.568 --> 11:37.028
- Have I got morning breath?
- No, quite the contrary.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.239
- Have you brushed your teeth?
- No.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.741
- I can smell toothpaste.
- So?

11:41.867 --> 11:47.163
Now you've broken an unwritten rule,
because now you smell all minty fresh

11:47.289 --> 11:49.708
- and I smell of cock and bum!

12:05.641 --> 12:07.642
So, did you like the club?

12:12.189 --> 12:15.442
- Did you like the club?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.402
Not really, no!

12:17.528 --> 12:18.862
I hated it.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.864
Right, you ready, then?

12:21.490 --> 12:22.866
For what?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.368
You can't get out of it
now, you promised me,

12:25.494 --> 12:28.955
- and I've come for my pound of flesh.
- I thought you were joking.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.083
Course not. Do you think I would
have slept with you otherwise?

12:35.629 --> 12:38.089
- Well, I'm not doing it.
- Oh, yeah, you are!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.134
What kind of stuff is
it you want me to say?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.011
Er, anything you like.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.263
Just talk about last night,
you know, what happened,

12:45.389 --> 12:47.891
what you wanted to happen.
It's up to you, really.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.101
- Why?
- Just because.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.854
- It's for an art project?
- Yeah.

12:52.980 --> 12:56.065
And you're just gonna lie
there and record me speaking.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.192
Exactly.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.527
And people are going
to listen to it.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.613
If you make the grade, yeah.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.284
Oh, come on. Erm...

13:08.329 --> 13:10.789
I... I don't know.
I can hardly remember anything.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.334
Just start from the beginning
when you first saw me.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.505
- I don't know, I just saw you.
- Oh, come on, stop stalling. Just talk.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.757
All right.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.969
OK. Erm...

13:25.095 --> 13:27.722
I saw you in the club

13:27.848 --> 13:30.183
and I thought you were...

13:30.309 --> 13:33.520
I thought you were out of
my league or whatever.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.314
- Erm, I liked your T-shirt a lot.
- What league are you in?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.900
I don't know. Erm...

13:40.736 --> 13:42.320
third division?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.280
I don't think you believe
that for a moment.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.157
Then you, erm...

13:46.283 --> 13:50.370
followed me into the toilets and tried
to eye me up at the urinal - hot.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.957
Well, you left.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.209
- And then I left.
- Why?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.253
There was someone else I wanted,
but by the time I found him

13:58.379 --> 13:59.963
he was with someone else, so...

14:00.089 --> 14:02.090
So I was your second choice?

14:03.467 --> 14:05.260
Why does that matter?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.264
- This is a stupid fucking conversation.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.515
Did you hear that?

14:10.641 --> 14:12.642
Queer?
- No.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.732
Oh, look!

14:19.859 --> 14:20.984
Queer!
- Glen...

14:21.110 --> 14:23.444
What the fuck do
you think you're doing?

14:24.613 --> 14:26.489
- Glen. Please just close the fucking window.
- Leave him alone!

14:26.615 --> 14:28.491
Fuck off!
- What did you say?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.785
Fuck off!
- I swear to God, if you don't quit,

14:30.911 --> 14:34.581
I'm gonna come down there and fucking
rape your holes, do you hear me?

14:41.755 --> 14:45.174
- Ooh, it's cold out there.
- Sorry, what... what was that?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.843
That was fun.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.305
They're gonna fucking chuck
bricks through my windows.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.557
You live 14 flights up.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.062
"I'm going to rape your holes"?

14:59.398 --> 15:03.026
Fucking hell.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.529
Who says that? Who...

15:11.452 --> 15:16.414
And, erm... Yeah, we came back
here, didn't we, obviously.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.959
And, er, I offered you
a drink, I think,

15:20.085 --> 15:22.045
although I can't
really remember.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.297
Erm...

15:24.423 --> 15:27.216
And then you kissed me in
the hallway, in my hallway.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.552
- And I groped you.
- Did you?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.679
And you groped me.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.600
And I was happy to feel
you had a big dick

15:35.726 --> 15:39.228
and it was throbbing
in your trousers,

15:39.355 --> 15:42.440
which was surprising
because you were so drunk.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.944
And then we went
into the bedroom.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.072
Can you remember what
you wanted to happen?

15:49.198 --> 15:51.074
Mmm, nope.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.201
What about when I
took your top off?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.119
Nope.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.372
I wanted to lick your pits.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.582
I've got a thing about pits.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.334
- Come on, lift up.
- No.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.336
- Let me have a see.
- No.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.545
Come on.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.672
- No!
- Why not?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.048
- Cos it's weird.
- It's not weird.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.925
- Yes, it is, it's weird.
- Let me have a look.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.385
No.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.470
You're pathetic.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.972
Stingy bitch, open up.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.098
All right.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.226
I'll show you, OK?
But don't touch my pits.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.436
- God, what is this, a museum?

16:20.562 --> 16:21.771
Open!

16:21.897 --> 16:23.398
OK.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.360
See? Very nice.
Good amount of hair.

16:28.404 --> 16:32.323
And then, er, you
started to jack me off.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.076
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.121
- Nope. I didn't.
- I thought you were too drunk to remember.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.332
We were in the hallway
and we were kissing,

16:41.458 --> 16:43.751
and like you said, you
took my shirt off.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.378
Erm...

16:46.672 --> 16:50.383
I remember that because
I was really sweaty

16:50.509 --> 16:52.552
and I was worried that I was
going to be all smelly.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.679
- You were fine.
- Good. Thank you.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.848
- Then what?
- Erm...

16:56.974 --> 17:00.393
OK, then you started kissing my
ears and then you kissed my neck

17:00.519 --> 17:02.520
and then you kissed my...

17:04.314 --> 17:07.108
then you kissed my
hand, which was...

17:08.193 --> 17:09.359
Yeah.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.951
Did you wish my cock was bigger?

17:17.661 --> 17:18.744
No.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.414
Have you had many cut cocks?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.165
Why do you ask that?

17:23.291 --> 17:25.501
I couldn't work out
if you were...

17:25.627 --> 17:28.337
pretending to be the type of
boy who didn't suck many cocks

17:28.464 --> 17:31.841
or you...
you actually were that type of boy.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.094
And this is what you were thinking
about, is it, when we were having sex?

17:35.220 --> 17:37.638
What about when I was
playing with your arsehole?

17:37.765 --> 17:40.516
- Why do you ask these things?
- Too hard, too soft?

17:40.642 --> 17:42.185
It was fine.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.770
Erm...

17:45.647 --> 17:48.107
- It was too hard, maybe.
- So why didn't you say anything?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.568
And you didn't want
me to fuck you.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.320
No, I didn't.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.946
Why?

17:55.365 --> 17:57.492
- Just because.
- You're not into the...

17:57.618 --> 17:59.243
It's not that, it's just...

17:59.369 --> 18:03.539
Would it have made
you feel too gay?

18:07.002 --> 18:09.879
In fact, are you actually out?

18:10.005 --> 18:12.215
- Yes.
- Are you sure about that?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.518
I just thought that we were
having a really nice time

18:23.644 --> 18:27.605
and it was lovely, it was
more than enough for me,

18:27.731 --> 18:32.026
so, erm, sorry, Glen, if
I don't make your grade.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.630
- How do you save it?
- Er...

18:52.756 --> 18:54.757
You've done it, that's fine.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.636
So, then.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.392
Did you have a
good time last night?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.352
Last night was sweet, yeah.

19:06.478 --> 19:10.815
Well, it was a delight to meet you.
And you really do have a lovely home.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.358
Thank you.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.784
See you soon.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.054
Queer!

19:54.693 --> 19:56.986
Fuck it.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.066
Ain't looking like a big boy now though, cos
that bitch ain't even clean downstairs,

21:59.192 --> 22:01.277
I don't want to tell you the destruction
that was going on down there.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.405
- Really?
- - It weren't clean!

22:04.531 --> 22:06.449
Anyhow, I'm thinking, "What can I do?
What can I do? What can I do?"

22:06.575 --> 22:10.453
I'm like, "All right, I'm not gonna get
hard, fuck it, I'll use the finger."

22:10.579 --> 22:14.290
Turn the lights off, and start thinking
of something nice while I finger her,

22:14.416 --> 22:17.209
get fucking squelching it down, I
might be able to get hard later.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.087
Got two fingers, like
the scissor thing,

22:20.213 --> 22:21.714
three fingers, four fingers,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.591
got my fucking whole
hand in like that.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.469
Fucking jab her and that.
Aargh, get in there, you bastard!

22:26.595 --> 22:29.597
- Anyway, I didn't fucking shag her.
- I was gonna say, what the fuck, like?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.974
Fuckin' hell, he's on
his phone, isn't he?

22:32.100 --> 22:35.561
Who are you fucking talking to?
You get lucky as well, did you, son?

22:35.687 --> 22:39.940
- No, no.
- No? Ah, he's a fucking shy one, isn't he?

22:40.067 --> 22:41.233
Don't worry, it weren't Becky.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.235
It weren't Becky.
You can fucking have her, mate.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.197
Bring your rubber gloves next time
and we'll fucking go twos up, eh?

22:46.323 --> 22:49.367
- Do the David Seaman on her.
- Shut up!

23:11.640 --> 23:13.182
Afternoon.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.229
There you go, you might need it.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.941
- Cheers.
- That's all right.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.778
Chin-chin.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.007
What a beauty.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.926
Thank you.

23:49.052 --> 23:53.514
I got it in a charity shop for,
like, 3 quid, it was a bargain.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.686
So, do you enjoy your job?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.147
Yeah, it's all right.

24:01.898 --> 24:05.025
There's nothing wrong with
being a lifeguard, you know.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.361
I didn't say there was.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.155
I'm just saying.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.867
I was in the swimming team
with one of my schools, so...

24:16.705 --> 24:19.165
- You ever save anyone's life?
- Yeah.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.624
Really?

24:20.750 --> 24:22.418
- Yeah.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.921
What's funny about that?
I've saved loads of people's lives.

24:26.047 --> 24:30.092
Old people mainly, but I've been a
lifeguard for years, so it's...

24:31.553 --> 24:33.554
Someone drowned once.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.348
- I was off duty though, so...
- Oh, shame.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.725
Yeah, I know.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.361
Fuck me!

24:49.488 --> 24:51.071
You all right?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.202
You need to stop smoking, mate.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.329
It's all right, I'll get
you a free day pass.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.500
This is a nice place
you've brought me to.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.711
So what do you do now?
I can't really remember, sorry.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.881
- I work in the gallery in town.
- That's right, I remember.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.257
Have you ever been?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.468
No. That's the ugly one, right?

25:12.594 --> 25:15.137
- Do you like art?
- Yeah.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.806
It doesn't matter if you don't.

25:17.933 --> 25:22.436
No, I like art. Just because I haven't
been to a gallery doesn't mean I don't.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.857
Have you travelled much?

25:26.983 --> 25:28.776
No, not really.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.904
- Have you ever been to America?
- No, I'd like to though.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.781
Listen, want a backie?

25:35.367 --> 25:36.659
No.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.914
You can't be... No, I can't.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.583
- Come on, put your leg over.
- Fuck's sake!

25:44.709 --> 25:46.835
I look like a twat!

25:46.962 --> 25:48.879
- Oh, Jesus. Ah, fuck!

25:49.005 --> 25:51.840
You on? OK, put your
arms around my waist.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.343
Come on, there we go.
Do you feel safe?

25:54.469 --> 25:57.221
- No!
- Good.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.224
- You ready?
- This is a bad idea!

26:00.350 --> 26:03.435
- It's a brilliant idea.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.276
- Whoo-ooo!

26:10.402 --> 26:12.528
Scream if you
want to go faster!

26:56.197 --> 26:58.282
I like all your stuff.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.783
Thanks.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.703
Looks like you raided
a charity shop.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.164
Yeah.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.501
I hate new stuff, you know?

27:13.548 --> 27:16.175
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.515
Like this mug, for example.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.479
This was probably owned by some lovely
little old lady with a moustache.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.605
Mmm.

27:29.731 --> 27:33.484
And she bought it and it was her
favourite thing in the whole wide world,

27:33.610 --> 27:36.612
and then she died, gave
it to her grandchildren,

27:36.738 --> 27:40.282
they hated it, sold it,

27:40.408 --> 27:42.451
then bought an Xbox or a Wii

27:42.577 --> 27:47.289
- or some flat-pack wardrobe from Ikea.
- Mmm.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.378
And now I've got
it, and I like it.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.631
- It's a very costly mug.
- What do you mean?

27:55.757 --> 27:58.258
To be able to buy a Wii...

27:59.302 --> 28:01.345
or an Xbox.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.265
I don't even know how
much those things are.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.393
Do you want milk, sugar?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.146
Yeah, one of those.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.773
OK.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.319
Just got to wait for
the kettle to boil.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.116
Are you hungry?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.283
No.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.577
I've got some nice pitta bread.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.329
I'm fine.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.374
Well, I'm starving, so I'm
going to have to eat.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
OK.

28:31.626 --> 28:34.962
I've been thinking about this
morning and your tape thing.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.588
Mm-hm.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.674
- It's for an art project, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.720
So is that what you want to
be, you want to be an artist?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.513
Kind of.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.268
So, and you really
don't have to tell me,

28:49.394 --> 28:52.187
how is your tape art project

28:53.022 --> 28:59.153
just going to be an art project
and not people talking dirty?

29:00.196 --> 29:02.197
You think talking
about sex is dirty?

29:02.323 --> 29:03.824
You know what I mean.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.535
It's just I'm not sure if...

29:07.912 --> 29:11.165
...people want to hear about the
random sex life of strangers.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.127
You just don't want people
hearing about your sex life.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.045
That's true.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.966
Imagine if everybody
was just open

29:21.092 --> 29:23.010
about what they did and
that everything was normal.

29:23.136 --> 29:26.221
- Yeah, but people are open, aren't they?
- Are they?

29:27.682 --> 29:29.767
There was this guy
in work today,

29:29.893 --> 29:31.685
I'm just sat there
having my lunch,

29:31.811 --> 29:34.646
and he starts talking about how many
fingers he can put up a girl's fanny.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.940
But was he gay?

29:37.066 --> 29:38.734
- No.
- Well, there you go, then.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.903
You like a lot of
condiments, don't you?

29:41.529 --> 29:42.946
I love my condiments.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.741
Gay people never talk
about it in public

29:46.785 --> 29:49.411
unless it's just cheap innuendo.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.624
I think it's cos
they're ashamed.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.920
Maybe it's just they're a
little bit embarrassed.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.922
Isn't that the same thing?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.174
It smells of spunk.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.093
Anyway, that tape thing
isn't really about sex at all.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.179
Really?

30:07.305 --> 30:09.556
But I know what artists sound like
when they talk about their work,

30:09.682 --> 30:12.267
so I'm not going to sit
and sound like a cunt.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.394
Well, it's a good job you're not
an artist yet, then, isn't it?

30:14.521 --> 30:16.522
Ooh, very funny!

30:18.233 --> 30:20.651
Come on, tell me.
I'm interested.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.738
All right.

30:25.865 --> 30:29.076
Well, you know what it's like when you
first sleep with someone you don't know?

30:29.202 --> 30:30.452
Yeah.

30:31.788 --> 30:36.583
It's... You, like,
become this blank canvas

30:36.709 --> 30:40.629
and it gives you an opportunity to project
onto that canvas who you want to be.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.384
And that's what's interesting,
because everybody does it.

30:46.594 --> 30:50.389
- So, do you think that I did it?
- Course you did.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.976
Well, what happens is,

30:54.102 --> 30:56.645
while you're projecting
who you want to be,

30:59.190 --> 31:01.400
this gap opens up between
who you want to be

31:01.526 --> 31:03.402
and who you really are,

31:03.528 --> 31:06.321
and in that gap, it shows you

31:06.447 --> 31:10.117
what's stopping you becoming
who you want to be.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.411
And all of this from
talking about sex?

31:13.955 --> 31:16.123
All of that from
talking about sex.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.501
Interesting.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.628
I like it.

31:21.754 --> 31:26.174
I'm not sure that I totally
understand what you're saying, but...

31:26.301 --> 31:28.302
Yeah, all this sounds better in my
head, I don't think I've explained...

31:28.428 --> 31:30.512
No, no, no, no, no.

31:30.638 --> 31:33.181
I'm interested.
I'm really interested.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.725
So what are you gonna do?

31:34.851 --> 31:38.437
- Are you just gonna play the recordings out loud...
- I don't know, I don't know.

31:38.563 --> 31:43.901
The problem is that no one's gonna come
and see it, because it's about gay sex.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.989
So the gays will only come because they
want a glimpse of a cock and they'll be...

31:49.115 --> 31:53.243
And the straights won't come because, well,
it's got nothing to do with their world.

31:54.579 --> 31:58.373
They'll go and see pictures of
refugees or murder or rape,

31:58.499 --> 32:00.959
but gay sex? Fuck off.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.213
Fuck it.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.215
Doesn't matter, does it?

32:08.551 --> 32:10.552
I'd come.

32:12.847 --> 32:14.973
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yeah, I would.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.977
OK, maybe I...

32:21.230 --> 32:23.106
Maybe I wouldn't come.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.868
Make sure you put your
thumb over the hole.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.371
- Do you want me to light it for you?
- Yeah.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.458
Tuck in.

32:49.258 --> 32:51.051
Here, do it again.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.141
That's it.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.108
Are you out to your parents?

33:06.234 --> 33:10.362
Are you out to your parents?
You don't look like the kind of boy who would be.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.032
Well...

33:15.159 --> 33:17.452
- Well what?
- It's complicated.

33:17.578 --> 33:20.580
It's not complicated,
you just have to do it.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.333
I came out to mine
on Mother's Day.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.003
- How old were you?
- Sixteen.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.255
- Did they freak out?
- No.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.259
I told them nature or nurture,
it's your fault, so get over it.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.052
Good answer.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.516
- I would, but...
- But what?

33:43.604 --> 33:45.605
I don't really know my parents.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.901
Actually, I don't know
who they are at all.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.033
That's interesting.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.201
It's fine.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.455
So what happened?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.043
Well, erm...

34:07.211 --> 34:10.255
I moved around in foster
homes until I was about 16.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.507
Mm-hm. Fuck.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.804
I met my best mate there,
Jamie, when we were 12.

34:17.929 --> 34:22.184
Er, yeah, it was nice, we
just went around as a pair.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.228
Fucking hell. What was it like?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.188
What?

34:28.608 --> 34:30.192
Being in care.

34:31.777 --> 34:34.696
It was fine.
I mean, I wasn't abused or anything.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.822
Shame.
You should have got a refund.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.120
- So, does... does he know about you?
- Who?

34:42.246 --> 34:44.121
- Jamie.
- Yeah.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.875
Yeah, I'm like his
brother, really.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.335
Everyone knows about
me in my friends.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.170
The close ones anyway.

34:55.384 --> 34:56.984
What?

35:01.474 --> 35:06.311
Is it really wrong that I'm finding the whole...
orphan thing pretty sexy?

35:09.273 --> 35:10.816
Oh, my God.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.569
What's wrong with you?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.739
Sorry, I think it's the weed!

35:18.366 --> 35:21.868
Are you serious...
Are you laughing at my childhood tragedy?

35:23.204 --> 35:27.499
I just got an image of you as
Oliver with Mr Bumble!

35:30.086 --> 35:32.087
Oh, fucking hell.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.131
- I'm a bad person.
- Yeah, you are.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.425
- I'm a terrible cunt.
- You're a terrible cunt.

37:28.537 --> 37:31.331
So, do you live with
Gill all the time?

37:31.457 --> 37:33.083
Er, yeah, she's my flatmate.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.710
She's all right, she
keeps out the way.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.880
- I quite liked her.
- Yeah, she's a good girl.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.634
Well, thank you for
this afternoon.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.344
Er, thank you.

37:44.470 --> 37:47.138
Erm, so I'll give
you a call later.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.099
- OK.
- OK.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.101
I will.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.479
Bye.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.621
- All right?
- Hello again. Look...

38:11.747 --> 38:13.873
there's something I
didn't tell you.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.375
Have you got a boyfriend?

38:15.501 --> 38:18.878
No, I don't have a boyfriend,
I don't do boyfriends. Erm...

38:19.880 --> 38:21.756
I'm going away tomorrow.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.927
- Cool, where are you going?
- Portland. It's in Oregon.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.096
Very nice.
How long are you going for?

38:28.222 --> 38:30.890
About two years, I
think, maybe more.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.603
Oh, I thought you meant, like,
for a holiday or something.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.523
No, I'm doing a course. Erm...

38:38.649 --> 38:43.570
"Contemporary Perspectives of
Modern Art in the 21st Century."

38:45.448 --> 38:47.324
So you're doing an art course.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.493
- Glen, that's... that's really great.
- I should have said something.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.745
No.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.290
It's fine. It's... It's great.

38:55.416 --> 38:58.418
Honestly, you...
you didn't have to tell me.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.545
Honestly - an art course.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.924
You...
You get to be a proper cunt now.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.262
I've told you now,
so I'm gonna go.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.977
Hey, erm, what are you doing tonight?
Cos I'm having some drinks with some friends

39:16.103 --> 39:18.313
and it would be pretty
cool if you came along,

39:18.439 --> 39:22.442
but it's up to you, cos I don't wanna
kind of put pressure on you or anything,

39:22.568 --> 39:25.070
so I'll send you a
text or something

39:25.196 --> 39:27.197
and then you can
come or not come

39:27.323 --> 39:30.492
and it's up to you, it doesn't
matter either way, OK?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.660
All right, all right, all right.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.877
- All right? All right?

41:04.003 --> 41:06.504
- How you doing?
- Yeah, not too bad, yeah. You all right?

41:06.630 --> 41:09.549
Look, Cathy's gone up town with
Lois - do you want to come round?

41:09.675 --> 41:12.552
- Are you up to anything?
- Has she? Erm...

41:13.304 --> 41:15.722
I might have plans
later, actually.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.974
Oh. All right. Well...

41:18.100 --> 41:21.478
Erm, going out, party, I think.

41:22.062 --> 41:25.106
- OK, what, like a work thing?
- No.

41:25.232 --> 41:28.443
Er, no, I've actually...
I met somebody. Someone I met.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.069
- Oh, right, oh, nice one!
- Yeah.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.822
When did you meet them?

41:32.948 --> 41:35.867
Er, I met him last night at Propaganda.
It's a gay bar.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.995
You said you were going
home when you left.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.663
Mmm, yeah, sorry, mate.

41:40.789 --> 41:44.292
I was going home, but I was just
on the bus and I was thinking,

41:44.418 --> 41:47.504
so I just...
I changed my mind, so, sorry.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.881
No, that's all right.
What's his name, then?

41:50.883 --> 41:52.509
- Glen.
- Glen?

41:52.635 --> 41:54.552
Well, look, why don't
you bring him tomorrow?

41:54.678 --> 41:56.513
No. No way.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.348
Go on, it'll be fine!

41:58.474 --> 42:00.642
- No.
- What's the problem?

42:02.561 --> 42:04.521
- OK.
- Well, it's up to you, whatever.

42:04.647 --> 42:08.942
- Listen, he's going away anyway, so...
- Oh, right, I see.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.903
I've got to go, Jamie, so
I'll catch you in a bit.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.490
- I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
- Yeah, all right. You'd better be there.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.617
All right, mate. Bye, bye, bye.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.744
He's had a girlfriend
too, for like...

43:42.870 --> 43:46.664
He's been going out with her for two
months and he hasn't even fingered her.

43:46.790 --> 43:50.126
- Definitely looks gay.
- Have you seen his walk?

43:55.758 --> 43:58.509
- And his voice too.
- Oh, yeah, his voice.

43:58.636 --> 44:02.805
He probably does straightening, like.
Conditions his hair every morning.

44:02.931 --> 44:04.974
He gets up at half-seven so
his mum can do his hair.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.893
- Have you seen his Facebook statuses?
- No.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.353
There's about 40 a day.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.856
All right? What can I get you?
- All right, mate. Do you do bitter?

44:53.982 --> 44:55.983
- Yeah.
- Can I get two pints of bitter?

45:29.601 --> 45:31.602
- I got you a drink.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.188
- I don't like beer.
- Do you not?

45:34.314 --> 45:35.481
Afraid not.

45:35.607 --> 45:36.983
Sorry.

45:38.026 --> 45:40.319
Why this place, Glen?

45:40.446 --> 45:45.533
It's a bit more fun, isn't it, than
your normal, erm... normal gay bar?

45:47.661 --> 45:49.662
I'm surprised you came.

45:52.291 --> 45:53.583
Really?

45:53.709 --> 45:56.502
- Little bit.
- Well, I'm here now.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.212
- Good.
- Cheers.

45:58.338 --> 45:59.505
Hi!

45:59.631 --> 46:01.883
We've got a new member of the group,
let's not make a fuss about it.

46:02.009 --> 46:05.553
This is Russell, everybody.
This is Cock 1, Cock 2, Cock 3,

46:05.679 --> 46:07.346
Dolly Parton, Cock 4, Lorna,

46:07.473 --> 46:09.432
you know Gill already.
- And this is all...

46:09.558 --> 46:12.643
- I'm Russell, nice to meet you.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.022
I went on the bed with a hard-on

46:16.148 --> 46:18.733
and I heard all this clanging
and things coming out of bags

46:18.859 --> 46:22.320
and zips and poppers and things, and I...
he was there for ages...

46:22.446 --> 46:24.280
Hey!

46:24.406 --> 46:26.032
Well done. Here we go!

46:26.158 --> 46:30.578
One, two, three, four, five...
Go!

46:32.706 --> 46:35.458
Anyway, so I was lying on
the bed waiting for him,

46:35.584 --> 46:37.126
and after about 10
minutes of this,

46:37.252 --> 46:40.505
it was like, I was starting to lose my
hard-on because it was getting boring,

46:40.631 --> 46:45.510
and then he walked in and he was fully
done up in leather, like boots and things

46:45.636 --> 46:47.178
and chaps and everything,

46:47.304 --> 46:49.347
and he was much older
than his picture said,

46:49.473 --> 46:51.808
and he walked in and I
was like, "Oh, fuck!".

46:51.934 --> 46:55.812
And he just put his boot on my bed and
he went, "Lick my fucking boots!".

46:55.938 --> 47:01.317
And I went like, "Er, I don't think
so, I think I'll pass actually."

47:01.443 --> 47:03.569
And he was like, "Lick
my fucking boots!".

47:06.865 --> 47:08.741
Sorry, guys, can I squeeze past?

47:08.867 --> 47:10.660
All right, how are you?

47:11.787 --> 47:13.621
I'd leave him to
it, if I were you.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.957
What's he doing?

47:16.083 --> 47:19.627
Well, he's just started
phase one of the attack.

47:21.880 --> 47:26.133
The whole straight narrative is there
for you to inherit, it's just there.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.136
There to shape your
foundations, to set you up...

47:29.263 --> 47:32.849
boy meets girl, they fall in love,
they go skipping through the meadows

47:32.975 --> 47:35.810
and that's how your life is set.
Everything is there.

47:35.936 --> 47:38.312
All the books, all the
films, all the TV shows,

47:38.438 --> 47:40.481
everything is just
inherited, given to you.

47:40.607 --> 47:43.818
I think he does like you though.
I mean, he wouldn't let me listen to the tape,

47:43.944 --> 47:46.529
and he always lets me
listen to the tapes, so...

47:46.655 --> 47:48.030
you must have made some
kind of impression.

47:48.156 --> 47:52.285
I'm quite glad he didn't let you have a
listen to the tape, to be honest with you.

47:52.411 --> 47:53.619
Yet!

47:53.745 --> 47:57.123
He didn't let me listen to
it yet - there's still time!

47:57.249 --> 47:59.333
What, is it dirty? Is it?

47:59.459 --> 48:01.502
- No, no!
- Proper sordid?

48:01.628 --> 48:02.628
No.

48:02.754 --> 48:05.131
Oh, boring.
Them ones are the best.

48:05.257 --> 48:08.175
- I took umbrage with the loud noise.
- You didn't take...

48:08.302 --> 48:11.220
- You make a loud... You made a loud noise.
- You didn't make umbrage with the loud noise.

48:11.346 --> 48:15.057
You made umbrage with the fact that you've
got a load of gay people in a straight bar.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.602
That's what you've got your problem with.
Admit it, just admit it.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.437
- No...
- Absolutely admit it.

48:19.563 --> 48:24.901
The thing is, Glen likes to be a
big fish, not a little tiddler.

48:25.027 --> 48:28.362
I mean, to be honest, I
think he's gonna bottle it.

48:28.488 --> 48:30.698
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.867
Some of us have
got a little bet.

48:32.993 --> 48:35.077
That's not very supportive.

48:35.203 --> 48:36.746
Supportive? No.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.789
No, I just understand
him, that's all.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.792
He does this. I mean like, once,

48:41.919 --> 48:43.878
he signed up to teach in Africa.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.421
I think it was Africa.

48:45.547 --> 48:48.341
It was just when he split up with John.
Has he told you about John?

48:48.467 --> 48:50.593
No, no, he hasn't told me about John.
To be honest with you, I don't really think...

48:50.719 --> 48:52.219
That was way back when
he did boyfriends.

48:52.346 --> 48:56.515
The sexuality... The sexuality of the
loud noise was not an issue with me,

48:56.642 --> 48:58.893
- it was the fact that the noise was loud.
- The sexuality of the loud noise?

48:59.019 --> 49:00.561
It was the fact that
the noise was loud.

49:00.687 --> 49:03.356
Oh, right, so it's just
merely a matter of decibels.

49:03.482 --> 49:08.069
He used to cheat on him a lot, John did,
and Glen was like, "It doesn't matter,"

49:08.195 --> 49:11.697
but it would matter to me, and then
at the end of the relationship,

49:11.823 --> 49:14.533
he was in the park, cruising,
and he got beaten up.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.035
What, Glen did?

49:16.161 --> 49:18.162
No, no, not Glen. John.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.665
Volume is the issue. That's it.
- The volume.

49:20.791 --> 49:25.086
Just ruining your night. We're just here
ruining your night, is that the problem?

49:25.212 --> 49:27.338
Look at us holding hands!
Look!

49:32.511 --> 49:34.303
What?

49:34.429 --> 49:36.138
Nothing.

49:36.264 --> 49:39.058
- You look like you want to kiss me.
- I do.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.852
Go on, then.

49:42.521 --> 49:44.563
No, not here. I can't...
I can't here.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.070
Oh!

49:57.285 --> 49:58.953
Ah, thank you.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.873
Do you want to get the
fuck out of here?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.667
What do you mean?

50:04.793 --> 50:06.794
Do you want to get the
fuck out of here?

50:27.399 --> 50:29.775
Don't you think your mates are going
to be a little bit pissed off?

50:29.901 --> 50:32.111
- Why?
- Well...

50:33.155 --> 50:35.281
I mean, we just
marched out of there.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.034
You practically pushed me out of the door,
I didn't even say goodbye to anybody,

50:38.160 --> 50:41.620
- you didn't say goodbye to anybody.
- Yeah, I don't do goodbyes.

50:43.665 --> 50:46.500
I actually had quite good fun in there.
It was all right.

50:46.626 --> 50:50.129
I liked your friends.
It was quite nice being around gay people.

50:50.255 --> 50:51.881
- Oh, don't do it.
- Don't do what?

50:52.007 --> 50:53.632
- I know what you're gonna say.
- What?

50:53.759 --> 50:58.179
You're gonna say, "Oh, it's nice being around
people of my own kind, my own people",

50:58.305 --> 51:02.016
"they think the same as me, we
talk about all the same things,

51:02.142 --> 51:06.062
"we've got the same things in common."
But it's just not like that, you know?

51:07.522 --> 51:10.608
This is David Lane.
- Essentially they're all just idiots.

51:10.734 --> 51:14.278
- This tram is for Phoenix Park.
- Except they dance a lot more.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.781
The next stop is Highbury Vale.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.868
So what do you think of Gill?

51:21.828 --> 51:23.537
- Yeah, she was nice.

51:23.663 --> 51:25.664
You're such a fucking liar.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.211
Ah, it's nothing.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.922
I wouldn't want anybody...

51:33.048 --> 51:35.299
- talking badly about my mates.
- What is it?

51:35.425 --> 51:37.927
- Honestly, it's nothing.
- Fucking spit it out.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.181
I don't know, Glen. I just...

51:44.059 --> 51:47.478
She's not very supportive, you
know, or understanding about...

51:47.604 --> 51:50.564
And this is only from what I've
spoken to her about, but I didn't...

51:50.690 --> 51:52.608
She just wasn't very supportive and
that's what you want, isn't it,

51:52.734 --> 51:58.322
you want your mates to be understanding
and to support your ideas and...

51:58.448 --> 52:00.574
- I don't know.
- What the fuck did she say?

52:00.700 --> 52:02.368
She didn't say anything,
she didn't say anything.

52:02.494 --> 52:06.455
It was just...
It was just an impression I got.

52:08.125 --> 52:11.627
Anyway, it's none of my business to start
talking about that kind of stuff, is it?

52:19.136 --> 52:21.887
I can't wait to get the fuck
out of here, to be honest.

52:22.013 --> 52:24.223
- No, you don't mean that.
- I do.

52:24.349 --> 52:25.724
Maybe I don't.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.768
Just my friends -
sometimes they're like...

52:27.894 --> 52:30.187
a noose around my neck,
do you know what I mean?

52:30.313 --> 52:33.440
No. I've got to be honest with you,
I don't really know what you mean.

52:33.567 --> 52:36.777
It's like when you've had the same friends
for too long, they become like...

52:36.903 --> 52:39.155
everything becomes cemented.

52:42.742 --> 52:44.785
- What, and that's a bad thing, is it?
- Of course it's a bad thing.

52:44.911 --> 52:48.664
I don't want to be in fucking
concrete, thank you very much.

52:48.790 --> 52:53.085
It's like they won't let you...
they won't let you be any version of yourself

52:53.211 --> 52:56.172
except an old version, or the
version that they want you to be.

52:57.465 --> 52:59.967
- I hope that's not true.
- You know it's true.

53:00.093 --> 53:02.845
Who wants to know
they're in the shit?

53:02.971 --> 53:06.473
If they see you trying to crawl out,
they're very happy to drag you back in.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.851
Oh, and that's what you're
trying to do, is it?

53:08.977 --> 53:12.479
You're trying to drag yourself
out of the shit!

53:12.606 --> 53:13.939
I'm trying to...

53:15.650 --> 53:17.651
redraw myself.

53:18.486 --> 53:21.363
- Of course. You being the artist that you are.
- Exactly, exactly.

53:22.157 --> 53:24.658
But everyone keeps fucking
hiding my pencil.

53:39.841 --> 53:42.176
Hiya, can we get
two cars, please?

53:43.220 --> 53:44.803
- Have you got three quid?
- Yep.

53:44.930 --> 53:46.472
There we go.

53:48.266 --> 53:51.352
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh-ho-ho, are you sure about that?

53:51.478 --> 53:52.937
There you go.

53:54.397 --> 53:55.397
Thank you.

53:58.568 --> 54:00.653
Scream if you wanna go faster!

54:07.702 --> 54:09.370
Fuck you!

54:28.265 --> 54:31.600
Remember, this was pre-internet
so, you know, it was, like,

54:31.726 --> 54:35.062
there wasn't any "straight boy
goes gay for pay" websites

54:35.188 --> 54:39.692
or stick-a-monster-cock-
up-your-arse-and-ear. Com.

54:42.445 --> 54:45.781
But my mum had this VHS
of A Room With A View.

54:45.907 --> 54:48.033
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah. I think I have.

54:48.159 --> 54:50.953
Is that the one with
all the poshies

54:51.079 --> 54:53.038
- in all the houses and stuff?
- Yeah.

54:53.164 --> 54:56.834
Well, they've got that, but also they've got
this scene where all the boys go running

54:56.960 --> 54:59.211
- naked round the lake.
- Oh, I see.

54:59.337 --> 55:03.299
And I'd frozen the video just on the moment
when you could see Rupert Graves' cock

55:03.425 --> 55:06.427
and you know what it's like when
you pause video, it's shuddering.

55:06.553 --> 55:07.886
Yeah.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.180
And I was tanking away
and there it was,

55:10.307 --> 55:13.976
and I spaffed up a huge
spiderweb of juvenile semen...

55:14.102 --> 55:16.478
...just as
my mate walked in.

55:16.604 --> 55:17.604
Oh, my God!

55:17.731 --> 55:19.940
And he looked at me and he
looked at the TV screen

55:20.066 --> 55:22.943
and he saw Rupert Graves'
shuddering cock and he knew.

55:25.363 --> 55:28.532
- What did he say?
- He called me a faggot, he called me a queer.

55:29.534 --> 55:33.454
But the weird thing was, in that moment, I
could see myself through his eyes, you know?

55:33.580 --> 55:37.041
I could see what I looked like.
And you know what?

55:37.167 --> 55:39.668
- You didn't care?
- I didn't care. Exactly.

55:40.920 --> 55:45.132
I thought, if he wants to see me as some
horny little faggotty, angry child,

55:45.258 --> 55:48.510
then that's fine with me,
doesn't make any difference.

55:48.636 --> 55:50.846
- Are you still friends with him?
- Nah.

55:51.848 --> 55:55.726
I wasn't friends with anyone else
after he told the rest of the school.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.603
That's awful, Glen.

55:57.729 --> 55:59.480
It is what it is.

56:37.102 --> 56:39.353
- Shall we have another little cheeky one?
- Yeah.

56:52.867 --> 56:57.413
- Oh, Glen, Glen, Glen!
- Whoo! I'm just breaking some ice!

56:57.539 --> 57:01.125
- You haven't met my neighbours, they're nuts.
- I'm breaking the ice with your neighbours.

57:01.251 --> 57:04.044
- Frankie upstairs will
be going nuts, dying.

57:04.170 --> 57:06.171
There's something I
didn't tell you today.

57:07.590 --> 57:08.674
Do you have a boyfriend?

57:08.800 --> 57:12.511
- Yeah, that's exactly it. I've got a boyfriend.
- Oh, fuck me!

57:12.637 --> 57:13.929
No.

57:14.055 --> 57:16.223
- No, you know your tape thing?
- Yeah.

57:16.349 --> 57:19.893
I've got something
kind of similar.

57:20.019 --> 57:22.271
Really? What do you mean?

57:22.397 --> 57:27.484
Well, obviously mine's private
and not public like yours.

57:27.610 --> 57:30.696
- Why am I telling you this?
- Well, then why do you do it?

57:32.323 --> 57:33.949
I don't know, just do.

57:34.075 --> 57:37.453
He was good-looking and
normal, which was nice.

57:37.579 --> 57:39.955
- He's not too camp.

57:40.081 --> 57:42.916
On the third date he told me that
when he came out to his parents,

57:43.042 --> 57:45.127
they refused to
ever talk about it.

57:45.253 --> 57:47.754
He said he didn't care but
it was obvious he did.

57:47.881 --> 57:51.133
Then to stop us talking about
it, he sang me a song.

57:51.259 --> 57:53.385
Fucking hell!

57:54.721 --> 57:56.388
Dickhead!

57:56.514 --> 58:00.851
I was mortified, and I wanted
Jamie to be there listening to it

58:00.977 --> 58:04.396
because I'm sure he would
have found it funny.

58:04.522 --> 58:08.484
And I knew that I could never see him
again, but I stayed that night anyway...

58:08.610 --> 58:11.278
- Aww... because I didn't
want him to feel bad.

58:11.404 --> 58:13.030
Samaritan.

58:14.657 --> 58:16.617
Did you tell Jamie about it?

58:20.246 --> 58:22.498
- Shut up!
- And you send it to the back of my throat.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.291
Ready? Come on.

58:24.417 --> 58:26.627
- It's quite sexy.
- OK.

58:30.256 --> 58:31.507
Beautiful. Good start.

58:31.633 --> 58:33.383
Do you want to have a go?

58:33.510 --> 58:35.302
Let's make it happen, come on.

58:37.680 --> 58:39.848
One, two, three.

58:42.101 --> 58:43.519
Isn't that amazing?

58:43.645 --> 58:46.480
I followed him around
the sauna for a while,

58:46.606 --> 58:51.443
and I was so nervous that I wasn't sure
I'd even be able to get an erection.

58:52.362 --> 58:55.197
We went into the cabin
but he wouldn't kiss me.

58:55.323 --> 58:58.075
All he wanted to do was suck me off
and get me to come in his mouth,

58:58.201 --> 59:02.037
which I did, but he wouldn't let me touch
him or anything, and then he left.

59:02.163 --> 59:05.582
And I saw him later as I was
getting changed and he ignored me.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.795
And it was then that I noticed
he had a wedding ring on.

59:09.921 --> 59:13.507
I felt bad and weird - bad for
me but also for his wife...

59:13.633 --> 59:16.468
and I wondered if when he
got home and he kissed her

59:16.594 --> 59:18.528
she could smell me on him,
and I wondered if the

59:18.529 --> 59:20.305
kids were waiting for
him in their bedrooms,

59:20.431 --> 59:23.016
wanting to say good night
to their dad, but...

59:23.142 --> 59:26.687
he was late because he was
sucking me off in the sauna.

59:26.813 --> 59:28.480
So.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.070
What?

59:35.196 --> 59:37.823
I met this guy who was nice.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.825
I've called him Paul Smith,

59:41.286 --> 59:43.996
but that wasn't his name because
I can't remember his name,

59:44.122 --> 59:46.832
but it was the aftershave
he was wearing.

59:46.958 --> 59:50.335
He had a really nice
flat near the cemetery

59:50.461 --> 59:52.921
and I think he worked in design.

59:53.047 --> 59:59.386
He told me his parents were fine about him
being gay, which must have been good,

59:59.512 --> 01:00:02.347
and he had photos of
them on his wall.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:08.353
He asked if he could fuck me, I
told him I'd never done it before

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.064
and that he needed
to be careful.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.151
I can remember being paranoid
about the condom coming off

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.946
and me getting AIDS and everybody
would think I was scum.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:25.704
He wouldn't give me his number
because he said he had a boyfriend.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.789
On the bus I felt so
ashamed and shitty.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.167
When I got back I puked up and
spent the rest of the day in bed

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.252
thinking about all
kinds of stuff.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.060
Have I freaked you out?

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.187
No, it's just enough now.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.942
I have, haven't I? I've freaked you out, I've
freaked you out. Do you think I'm a freak?

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.070
You are a freak, but
that's all right.

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.952
What did this guy look like?

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:09.706
Why?

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.750
Just because.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.131
I don't know, he had blond hair.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.637
Did he look kind of Swedish?

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.598
- I suppose.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.064
He'd have fucking loved this.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.607
Who?

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.695
His name was John
though, not Paul.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.077
Who's John?

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.454
You're a terrible
liar for a faggot.

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:55.210
I knew Gill couldn't
keep her mouth shut.

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.046
I didn't ask her anything.
She...

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:00.048
Fuck it.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:02.175
It doesn't matter.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.607
Look, straight
people like us as long as

01:02:11.608 --> 01:02:13.645
we conform, we behave
by their little rules.

01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.772
Imagine your friends,
if you suddenly started

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:17.816
getting all really political
about being a fag

01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:21.695
or you got suddenly like camp and swishy
or talked about rimming all the time.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.156
Yeah, but that's not what
I'm like, is it? That's not who I am.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.367
Well, trust me they like it, as long
as we don't shove it down their throats.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:29.870
OK, well, why should I
just shove it down their throats?

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.497
Because they shove it down our throats
all the time, being straight...

01:02:32.623 --> 01:02:34.750
straight story lines on
television, everywhere,

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.919
in books, on billboards,
magazines, everywhere.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:41.840
- But, oh, the gays, the gays...
- We mustn't upset the straights!

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:44.050
Shh, watch out, the
straights are coming.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.970
Let's not upset them, let's
hide in our little ghettos,

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.723
let's not hold hands, let's
not kiss in the street, no.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:53.018
We have the chance to
make up our own shit,

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:57.439
we can grow our own garden and
put little flowers and pansies

01:02:57.565 --> 01:03:01.276
and gay gnomes in it and water
features and water sports and slings,

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:04.988
but no, everybody wants to concrete the
fucker over and get a gas barbecue.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.699
You're obsessed with concrete.
You're absolutely obsessed with the stuff.

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:11.620
But why would you want concrete when
you can have whatever you want?

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.705
I'm not saying people shouldn't
forge relationships,

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:17.083
all I'm saying is that we don't
need someone to sanction it,

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:21.671
- to make it legitimate, to make us respectable.
- Yeah, heaven forbid.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.549
And don't tell me that people
get married because of love.

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:28.011
People get married for the same reason
that they buy a house or buy a dog,

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:32.265
to tie them down so that they go, "Oh, no,
we couldn't possibly go away this weekend."

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:35.018
"Who'd look after Buster?
Couldn't possibly leave Buster alone."

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.480
- Glen, maybe sometimes people just like dogs.
- And it's not even proper marriage anyway.

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:42.192
In America they went out on the
streets and fought for equal rights,

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.903
and over here people are
too busy on fucking Grindr

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:48.323
or shaving their arses to be able to do anything.
Where's their fight?

01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:51.868
It's a fight, isn't it, for something
that you don't believe in.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.788
- That's not the point.
- Well, it is, it is, kind of.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.207
A man standing up
with another man,

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.710
in front of everyone saying that, "I
love you and I want to get married,"

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.171
I think that's a pretty
fucking radical statement.

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:08.301
I mean, standing up and saying, "I want
to spend the rest of my life with you,"

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:11.513
when everybody's looking
at them, saying...

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:13.765
that it's wrong, it's
disgusting, it's sick.

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:17.936
I mean, people say that we should go to
hell for this - fucking go to fucking hell,

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:21.273
I mean, why do people fucking say
that, do you know what I mean?

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:25.735
So, actually, standing up and saying,
"You know what, I love you,"

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:30.031
"and fuck you and fuck you, I don't give a
fuck what you fucking think, I don't care."

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:34.953
- That is pretty fucking amazing.
- But why do people have to feed into the system?

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:37.622
Oh, my God, now you sound like
a fucking teenager, Glen.

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:39.833
I mean, earlier, you asked me

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.544
if I thought that people got married
because they love each other.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.170
- Yeah?
- Right, OK,

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:47.132
well, maybe they
do, maybe they do.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:50.594
And, yeah, maybe...
fucking maybe it is stupid,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.264
and maybe they will get divorced
and all that kind of shit,

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.474
but fucking who cares?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.476
Why does it bother
you so much, Glen?

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:02.898
Why does it bother you that maybe
two people fucking love each other

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:05.358
and they want to get married
and they want a relationship

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:07.485
and they just want to be happy?

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.201
Do you want another line?

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:18.288
Why do you think it's gonna
be so different in America?

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.498
Because it will be.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.251
- Have you ever been properly alone?
- Of course I have.

01:05:23.377 --> 01:05:25.086
I mean properly. Alone.

01:05:25.212 --> 01:05:29.799
Sat in a hotel room in Portland all
by yourself, no friends, alone.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.219
- Yes.
- I don't believe you. I don't believe you.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:37.057
In a week you're gonna
go completely mental.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.560
Of course you are, because
you're gonna have no friends,

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:44.356
and you're gonna compromise because that
is what people do, they compromise,

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:47.275
because nobody, fucking...
fucking nobody,

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.945
nobody can deal with
being by themselves.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:52.030
I don't want to compromise.

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:55.200
There you go again.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:58.036
You're condescending me, it's like
you're always fucking attacking me!

01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:00.413
- I'm not attacking you.
- You fucking are!

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:03.792
I mean, it's like you want
everybody to think independently,

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.753
but you want everyone to
fucking agree with you.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:08.129
I mean...

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:11.424
why can't you just understand that
some people just want to be happy?

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.385
Are you happy?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.139
I'm fine.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:23.478
You know what, yeah, things
could be fucking better.

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:25.188
Easier.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.691
But I am absolutely fine.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.025
Sure you are.

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.319
- Don't you fucking dare.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:33.363
- Don't you fucking dare presume...
- Calm down.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:36.574
...that you understand me.
You think just because I can't...

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:39.536
You think just because I can't
walk around the fucking streets

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:44.207
holding hands or talking to my mates about
fucking sucking cocks, that you know me.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.085
- No, I don't.
- I can see it in your eyes, Glen,

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:50.255
I can see it, that you think...

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.383
...you think I'm a fucking idiot
because I want a fucking relationship.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.510
- Did I say that?
- But the thing is, Glen...

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.889
the thing is, Glen, I think
that you want one too.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:16.573
I think you would make
an amazing boyfriend.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.409
That's not what I'm f...
That's not what I'm saying.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:21.494
- I don't...
- It's not about me. Fuck me.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.372
I don't want one.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.876
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:31.046
John has fucked you
up, because...

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.882
Let's stop this now before we go
somewhere that we don't want it to go.

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:37.343
...because he's cheated on you...
- You don't know nothing about me and John.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.472
You don't know nothing about how I feel,
about whether he cheated on me or not.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.766
And, for the record, I don't give
a shit that he cheated on me.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.727
I give a shit that he was a
fucking liar and a faggot

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.812
and he couldn't stand
up for himself.

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:50.732
Couldn't stand up for...
Glen, he was beaten up in a fucking park...

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.776
- Look, look, look.
...because he was gay!

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:57.489
Maybe if it's easier if I tell you
that I'm brokenhearted, but I'm not.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:59.824
I don't want...

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:05.413
I can't have a
boyfriend right now.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.211
And that's all there
is to say about it.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:19.928
Now, I really don't want
us to fall out about this.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.180
Really, I don't.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.362
I need to go to the toilet.

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:42.033
I think I need to
go to the toilet.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.392
Oh, fuck.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:58.026
♪ Before that Honeybear
had given up

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:03.615
♪ He felt so sad and lonely

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:10.955
♪ Then one night he
looked up and he saw

01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:16.336
♪ He saw his one and only...

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.674
I thought I heard a firework.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.220
It's probably just some kids.

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:27.972
Probably.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.355
I'm really sorry, just...

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.775
I was a dick. Sorry.

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.111
It's all right.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.155
Probably too much coke.

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.531
Yeah.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.785
Blame it on the drugs,
I always say.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.627
Talking of drugs,

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.757
this is my secret
reserve of master kush.

01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:04.801
Would you like some?

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.222
Thank you.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.203
Swap?

01:11:32.329 --> 01:11:33.830
Thank you.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.401
I think... Stop. I'm gonna come.

01:14:50.527 --> 01:14:52.111
Shhh.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:27.313
You know, when I'm...
when I'm at home I'm absolutely fine.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.357
Fine?

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.816
Yeah.

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.361
Completely.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.155
I don't...

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:39.617
I don't care and I don't
even think about it.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.079
I just...

01:15:44.164 --> 01:15:46.165
I'm not embarrassed, I'm not...

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:49.502
I'm not ashamed, and I don't...

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:51.629
I don't want to be straight.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.799
You know, not now anyway.

01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:58.886
I'm happy. I'm happy being gay.

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:02.848
But?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.064
It's when I go outside,

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:12.650
like, you know, just
to Jamie's or...

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.028
or to Tesco's or to work. It...

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:20.741
It kind of...
It's hard to explain,

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:22.868
but it...

01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:27.331
...it kind of feels like
I've got indigestion.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:32.211
It actually feels exactly
like indigestion.

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:37.216
And...

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.055
it just makes me angry,

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.602
you know, that I feel
like that because...

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.314
because it's so
fucking pathetic.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.318
You know, I'm a grown man,
and I look at you, and...

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.654
and I see you and you can
do it and you're amazing.

01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:04.619
I just don't understand
why I can't.

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.757
You know your log thing?

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.508
Yeah.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:25.014
You're right about
people coming out

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.600
and what their parents
say and stuff.

01:17:28.518 --> 01:17:29.977
Yeah?

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.981
I just wondered why.

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:37.568
Erm...

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.530
it interests me.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.408
It's like, erm...

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:48.037
everyone's got their story,
haven't they, it's like a...

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.164
gay rite of passage.

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:52.917
But you don't.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.753
I suppose, yeah.

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.339
That's what I thought.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:05.346
Do you ever think about
finding your parents?

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.268
No. Not really.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.229
Why not?

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.649
Er...

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.776
I don't really see the point.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:24.699
You know, I don't think
it would change anything.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:31.914
Why don't I...

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.626
pretend to be your dad...

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.379
...and you
can come out to me?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.465
That is so weird.

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:44.135
Just ignore the fact
we just had sex.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:48.264
I don't think I can ignore
the fact we just had sex.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.890
Try.

01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:53.018
OK.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.695
Dad?

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.657
I've got something that
I need to tell you.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:08.617
What's that?

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.121
I'm gay.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.127
Hmm.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.422
I like guys, not girls.

01:19:32.058 --> 01:19:33.684
Well.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.565
You know what, son?

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.653
It doesn't matter to me.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.617
I love you just the same.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.705
And guess what?

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:56.457
What?

01:19:58.418 --> 01:20:00.753
I couldn't be more proud of you

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.257
than if you were the
first man on the moon.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.483
Good morning.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.863
- I made you coffee.
- Thanks.

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:21.417
So what you doing today?

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.002
Erm...

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:27.548
I've got to go over to
Jamie's house, erm...

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:32.803
there's a party, it's my
goddaughter's birthday, so...

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:35.347
- You're a godfather?
- Yeah.

01:21:36.349 --> 01:21:38.475
You're not religious, are you?

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.186
No. They just asked me.

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:46.817
That's very nice, thank you.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:52.323
Erm...
What time's your train today?

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.369
Why?

01:21:57.495 --> 01:21:59.330
No reason.

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:05.669
Are you going to come and sing
to me, or beg me to stay?

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:08.797
No, I don't think so, no.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:13.510
It's about...
4:30, I don't know.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.800
- Glen...
- Shhh.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:13.505
- Hiya!
- Hiya.

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.966
- You made it, I'm made up.

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.260
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.429
Come in, then.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.473
- You stink of booze!
- Do I?

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:23.682
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:26.977
- Did you have a session last night?
- Didn't Jamie say anything to you?

01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:30.022
- No. Who wants
to play Twister?

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:33.025
Right, look who's here, everyone!
Look who's here!

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.235
Hey, all right, mate?

01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:37.738
- Hiya, mate.
- All right?

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:39.615
Yeah, yeah.
Where's the girl, then?

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.033
Lois, look!

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.744
Hey! Gaps! All right, missus?

01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:46.663
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:48.707
- Go on, take it, then.
- What do you say?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:53.378
If the Commando stands at
1020 which means the player...

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:55.422
Oh, it's too complicated,
let's do it again.

01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:57.508
Has to count either 1 to 10 or...

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.261
All right, that's it,
I'm not playing.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:04.973
All right, well, come on...

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.227
What do you call a girl that
sits in the middle of a tennis court?

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:09.478
I don't know.

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.188
- Annette.

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:14.775
I've got one, I've got one,
I've got one. What goes "Ooh"?

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:17.152
- A cow with no lips.

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.963
What's going on?

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.842
Nothing.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.844
Nothing's going on.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:47.683
Well, there obviously is.
Are you going to tell me about it or what?

01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:57.151
No. I feel... It feels weird talking
to you about it, I don't know. Sorry.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.237
Weird?

01:26:00.363 --> 01:26:03.240
We're best mates, we talk about
all kinds of stuff. Come on.

01:26:03.366 --> 01:26:06.952
Yeah, but we don't talk about this kind
of stuff, do we, that's not what we do.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:09.746
I've never spoken to you
about this kind of stuff.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.874
Yeah, I know.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:29.349
I don't know, Jamie, I
don't know, it's...

01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:33.520
it's stupid really.

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:34.938
I mean...

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:37.232
this guy I've met,
Glen, you know,

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.860
I met him two days ago, he doesn't
know me, I don't know him,

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:41.862
and he...

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:45.449
I met him, like, two days
ago, two days is nothing.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.705
I don't know, I just feel a
bit of a twat, that's all.

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:57.169
I think it's just cos I'm hung over
and tired and he's going away and...

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:03.091
Well, you'll be able to see him
when he gets back, won't you?

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:06.553
No, no, I won't, because
he's not coming back.

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.598
He's moving to America, so...

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.936
that's it.

01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:19.566
Well, what time's he leaving?

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.569
Doesn't matter.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:24.738
No, come on, what
time's he leaving?

01:27:24.864 --> 01:27:26.657
I can run you in the car.

01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:31.161
What about the cake?

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:32.996
Don't worry about
the fucking cake.

01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:35.415
- Cathy will go nuts.
- So?

01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:37.834
Lois is going to want
you around, isn't she?

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:41.171
I want to be here for Lois,
it's my goddaughter's birthday.

01:27:41.297 --> 01:27:43.006
I'll be half an hour.

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:44.967
Come on, I'll run
you in the car.

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:19.126
24-hour CCTV recording
is in operation at this station.

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:44.901
- I fucking knew you'd come.
Did you?

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.070
Such a goddamn romantic.

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:51.992
Looks like it, eh?

01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:58.957
So is this our
Notting Hill moment?

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.420
You know, I've never
seen it, ever.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:06.840
Neither have I, but I imagine
there's a declaration of love

01:29:06.966 --> 01:29:09.634
- and everybody applauds.
Yeah!

01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:17.225
Do you reckon that's what
would happen with us?

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.227
Might do. Could give it a go.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.148
They'd either clap or
throw us under a train.

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:47.881
I'm...

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:55.639
24-hour CCTV recording
is in operation at this station.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.601
I want you to know I'm not
here to stop you from going.

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:02.062
- Please be quiet. Shut up!
- No, no, no.

01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:03.855
I just want to...
I just want to...

01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:06.525
I just want you to know that...

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.322
Oh, fuck.

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:18.829
You're a bastard for coming down here.
Fuck me.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:42.769
I don't know what
the fuck I'm doing.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:46.481
You'll be great.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.985
- You'll have the most amazing time.
Fuck's sake.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.990
Fuck.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.770
- Fucking gay boys!
- Gay boys!

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.857
I've got something for you.
Ignore them.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:37.032
I couldn't remember
your surname.

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:49.044
Right, I've got to go.

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:27.017
Erm...

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.103
I... I don't know.
I can hardly remember anything.

01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:33.523
