Is it all right if
I stay over tonight?

00:24.734 --> 00:26.734

Who's Jimmy?

00:26.734 --> 00:28.533

17:09.100 --> 17:12.233
I'll bring by some stuff.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.533
I really screwed
up Thanksgiving.

17:17.533 --> 17:20.166
No, it was no big deal.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.767
The kids?

17:21.767 --> 17:24.367
I must have scared
the shit out of them.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.367
They're good.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.367
We, uh, talked
it out last night,

17:28.367 --> 17:31.300
and I tucked them in,
they're fine today.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.633
You didn't
tuck them in.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.600
I read books to them,
the little ones, anyway.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.667
(chuckles)
You'll be out soon.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.400
You'll see for yourself.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.266
Not soon.

17:42.266 --> 17:43.300
72 hours.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.166
You already got
15 under your belt.

17:48.133 --> 17:51.100
I signed myself in
for 60 more days.

17:51.100 --> 17:54.300
Voluntary commitment.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.400
Well, tell them
you changed your mind.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.567
I can't.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.667
That's part
of the deal.

18:00.667 --> 18:05.734
Frank, I got to
get myself normal.

18:05.734 --> 18:08.300
I can't keep doing this to them.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.166
You're just a little blue.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.700
It happens to everyone
every now and again.

18:15.700 --> 18:19.200
I can take care of you at home.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.000
No, you can't.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.600
I love you.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.500
You belong with us.

18:41.467 --> 18:44.266
I'm...

18:44.266 --> 18:48.633
I'm where I need
to be, okay?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.500
I got to go.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.100
(sobbing softly)

18:58.100 --> 19:00.066
I got group.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.500
(door closes)

19:10.500 --> 19:12.734
(knocking)

19:12.734 --> 19:14.600
Can I borrow a cup of cocaine?

19:14.600 --> 19:16.734
All out.
Coffee?

19:16.734 --> 19:20.066
How are the little
ones this morning?

19:20.066 --> 19:21.767
After seeing their mother
slit her wrists?

19:21.767 --> 19:23.600
Traumatized.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.100
Has to be support groups for
kids who've seen shit like that.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.200
Yeah, in maximum
security prisons

19:29.200 --> 19:31.100
after they've mowed down
half their classmates.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.166
You let Steve spend the night?

19:35.166 --> 19:37.467
You mean Jimmy?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.367
Fuck that, I'm
calling him Steve.

19:39.367 --> 19:41.100
I sent him out on a quest.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.233
Mm! Making him re-win
the heart of the virgin?

19:44.233 --> 19:45.367
(babbling)

19:45.367 --> 19:46.600
Christ, V,

19:46.600 --> 19:48.433
I can't let him
back into this madness.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.767
Isn't that his choice?

19:49.767 --> 19:51.667
Well, he thinks
he wants it now,

19:51.667 --> 19:53.367
but just wait a year or two.

19:53.367 --> 19:56.233
When I have one in the oven
and Frank throws up in our bed

19:56.233 --> 19:57.433
in the middle of the
night or Monica tries

19:57.433 --> 20:00.333
to hang herself in a closet
with an old shoelace.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.567
He's a big boy, he can
make his own decisions.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.500
Hey, Carl.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.066
Sleep okay?

20:07.066 --> 20:09.300
What do you think?

20:13.066 --> 20:15.000
FIONA:
You hungry?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.533
Let me make you a sandwich.
CARL: Okay.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.300
Disability check

20:21.300 --> 20:23.233
doesn't come
for another week, Frank.

20:23.233 --> 20:25.300
I went to visit your mother
in the hospital this morning.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.033
We have to get
her out of there.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.300
Best place for her.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.266
She's fragile.
She's broken.

20:30.266 --> 20:32.066
They want to
make her normal.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.533
They want to help her.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.567
By which they mean average,
boring, medicated,

20:36.567 --> 20:38.133
a Stepford Monica.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.700
She tried to kill herself
last night;

20:39.700 --> 20:41.000
boring would be a blessing.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.633
They perform lobotomies now.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.633
No, they don't.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.667
Shock treatment?
No.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.000
Actually, I think they do.
Princess Leia did it.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.467
100,000 volts
of electricity

20:50.467 --> 20:52.300
zapped into her skull!

20:52.300 --> 20:56.333
Draws so much power,
it takes out entire city blocks.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.033
When our lights dim,
some poor fucker's

20:58.033 --> 20:59.000
getting his brains fried.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.166
Don't listen
to him, Carl.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.166
Eat your breakfast.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.500
What's a lobotomy?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.667
They jam a screwdriver

21:03.667 --> 21:05.467
into your head
and scramble your brains.

21:05.467 --> 21:07.333
No, they don't. Jesus, Frank.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.200
Yeah, they do!
They're gonna put Mom

21:09.200 --> 21:10.467
back on her meds.
They're gonna make her better.

21:10.467 --> 21:12.433
She's not better on her meds.

21:12.433 --> 21:15.467
She's a zombie. She gives up
everything she loves in life.

21:15.467 --> 21:18.567
Yeah, like what?
Drugs, alcohol, you?

21:18.567 --> 21:20.033
Us.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.667
I'm gonna bust
her out of there

21:26.667 --> 21:28.433
before they steal what
makes Monica Monica.

21:28.433 --> 21:29.400
Are you with me?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.567
Leave her alone, Frank.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.266
She needs a chance to get well.

21:33.266 --> 21:34.567
Somebody can steal
what makes you you?

21:34.567 --> 21:36.233
No.
Carl?

21:36.233 --> 21:37.767
He's not helping
you, either.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.333
Can I bring my Mac-10 pistol?

21:39.333 --> 21:41.233
Leave him out of this.
The pistol's going back

21:41.233 --> 21:42.600
to the cops.
Where's your sister?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.734
Shower.

21:44.734 --> 21:46.633
Leave Debbie alone, Frank!
No.

21:48.467 --> 21:51.100
Monica will be better when she
comes out of the hospital, Carl.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.266
I passed.

21:54.266 --> 21:56.367
The GED-- I passed.

22:01.734 --> 22:03.734
(gasps)
Daddy!

22:03.734 --> 22:06.033
Daddy, you're
supposed to knock!

22:06.033 --> 22:08.433
Do you love your mother?

22:08.433 --> 22:11.266
Cindy says they make this thing
for women who can't produce

22:11.266 --> 22:12.734
their own milk.

22:12.734 --> 22:15.467
You hang this doohickey
around your neck,

22:15.467 --> 22:21.500
and then you tape these
right over

22:21.500 --> 22:22.700
your nipples.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.100
And the baby
can still breast-feed.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.734
It's okay, honey,
I-I can do it.

22:27.734 --> 22:30.633
No, it's important
for both of us to bond with him.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.667
Okay.
(fussing)

22:34.667 --> 22:36.767
Okay.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.000
There, sweet boy.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.767
(chuckling):
Whoa.

22:45.767 --> 22:47.233
Wow.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.633
That's... Whoa.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.100
Whoa!

22:50.100 --> 22:51.266
(laughs)

22:51.266 --> 22:53.100
Now I know what
all the fuss is about.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.200
(rattling at door)

22:55.200 --> 22:57.300
(gasps)
Someone's here.
Oh.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.433
(door opens)

22:59.433 --> 23:00.533
Mom?

23:02.066 --> 23:04.000
Mom.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.567
Sweetie!

23:06.567 --> 23:08.633
My goodness! Home already?

23:08.633 --> 23:11.633
Did the hospital
let you leave?

23:11.633 --> 23:12.767
Where is it?

23:12.767 --> 23:14.367
Thought they usually
like to keep you

23:14.367 --> 23:16.667
for at least a day.
Where is it, Mom?

23:16.667 --> 23:18.533
Where's what, honey?

23:18.533 --> 23:20.266
It.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.734
The baby that shoved
its ginormous head

23:21.734 --> 23:24.400
out of my cooter for six
endless hours last night.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.700
Oh, my. Did they lose it?

23:26.700 --> 23:30.400
They showed me the video footage
of you taking it.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh, that baby.
They were gonna call

23:35.000 --> 23:36.533
the police, but I said no.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.433
Where is it?

23:41.700 --> 23:43.500
Now, Mom!
In the dryer.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.667
Take it out.

23:52.667 --> 23:53.734
I think he's napping.

23:53.734 --> 23:55.166
Take it out!

23:55.166 --> 23:56.433
I don't want to touch it!

23:58.700 --> 24:00.767
You're leaking.

24:00.767 --> 24:03.567
(sighs)

24:06.033 --> 24:08.133
Isn't he beautiful?

24:08.133 --> 24:09.567
Take it back to
the hospital.

24:09.567 --> 24:11.066
Somebody will want it.

24:11.066 --> 24:13.100
I want it.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.233
Well, you can't have it.

24:14.233 --> 24:17.166
He's such a sweet boy.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.734
He never cries.

24:19.734 --> 24:21.700
He's so handsome.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.700
We want
to name him Hiram

24:23.700 --> 24:25.500
after your grandfather.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.266
Or maybe Ming, to keep him
wired into his Chinese-ness.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.734
Shut up, Jody.

24:30.734 --> 24:32.734
It's going back.

24:32.734 --> 24:35.700
Karen, please don't do this.

24:35.700 --> 24:39.066
They'll give it to the retarded
freaks' home or whatever.

24:39.066 --> 24:41.033
He's my grandson.

24:41.033 --> 24:44.233
I won't let you
throw him away

24:44.233 --> 24:46.467
like used Kleenex.

24:46.467 --> 24:48.200
You know, Karen, your
mom might be right.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.066
Maybe she should keep
him for a while.

24:50.066 --> 24:51.467
You know, who knows

24:51.467 --> 24:53.433
what social services is
going to do with him?

24:53.433 --> 24:55.000
Butt out, Lip!

24:55.000 --> 24:56.066
What are you
even doing here?

24:56.066 --> 24:57.467
He's not even yours.

24:57.467 --> 24:59.166
This is none of your
goddamn business.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.200
At least call Tim Wong
or whoever the father is

25:01.200 --> 25:02.300
and tell him about it.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.500
Get out!

25:09.633 --> 25:11.333
You dodged a fucking RPG

25:11.333 --> 25:13.633
getting tossed over
by this one.

25:13.633 --> 25:15.767
Don't I know it, man.

25:15.767 --> 25:18.533
Take it back to the hospital.
(door opens and closes)

25:18.533 --> 25:20.200
What if they won't
take it back?

25:20.200 --> 25:21.533
Then drop it in a basket

25:21.533 --> 25:23.066
and leave it at
the fire station.

25:23.066 --> 25:24.100
I don't give a shit.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.100
SHEILA:
No.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.500
No.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.166
Yes!

25:30.166 --> 25:33.133
He is staying with me.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.567
Fine!

25:37.667 --> 25:40.233
Then I'm calling the police.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.066
Lip here?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.533
Lip!

26:19.667 --> 26:21.567
It's your sister.

26:27.033 --> 26:29.066
So...

26:31.567 --> 26:33.567
How'd you find me?

26:33.567 --> 26:35.700
Jimmy.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.133
How's Karen?

26:42.133 --> 26:43.333
Girl's a
fucking bitch.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.166
My cousin,
Eli, was born

26:45.166 --> 26:46.767
with a foot coming out
of his knee.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.166
Now he's a blacksmith.

26:48.166 --> 26:50.300
Only one who can
pump the bellows

26:50.300 --> 26:52.200
without using his hands.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.567
I passed my GED.

26:58.667 --> 27:01.033
Don't look so surprised.

27:01.033 --> 27:02.300
No, I'm not.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.166
That's, um...
that's great.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
So... deal's a deal.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.667
Ah, too late.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.600
Spilt milk.
I passed.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.033
You go back to school.
Water under the bridge.

27:19.033 --> 27:21.033
Knock off the clichés.

27:21.033 --> 27:23.500
Road not taken.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.266
I want you home, Lip.

27:30.266 --> 27:32.600
We all do.

27:42.066 --> 27:44.066
Right.

27:59.667 --> 28:02.734
FRANK:
It's cold water and
sleep deprivation.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.233
Make you stand all day

28:04.233 --> 28:06.233
with electrodes tied
to your genitals.

28:06.233 --> 28:08.734
I think you're mistaking
Cook County for Abi Grabie.

28:08.734 --> 28:10.533
Abu Gradie.
Abu Ghraib.

28:10.533 --> 28:13.233
Did a tour with the
Guard-- Basra.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.100
They don't do any
of that, Frank.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.367
I was in there
last year

28:16.367 --> 28:17.734
after my
accidental overdose.

28:17.734 --> 28:20.367
Accidental? You set yourself
on fire freebasing.

28:20.367 --> 28:23.300
It was mostly us
sitting in a circle

28:23.300 --> 28:26.233
in a group talking
about how your family

28:26.233 --> 28:28.033
screwed you up.
KEVIN:
Oh, Monica talking
about Frank?

28:28.033 --> 28:29.233
That ought to take a while.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.667
Frank, you got any cash?

28:32.667 --> 28:34.767
Moolah? Green?

28:34.767 --> 28:37.400
