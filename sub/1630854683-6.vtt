00:01.769 --> 00:02.901
Andrew: Good thing we kept
our Halloween costumes.

00:02.970 --> 00:04.135
I think the mold
is spreading.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.740
Camille: Is it the good
kind or the bad kind?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.309
Andrew: There's
no good mold, camille!

00:10.311 --> 00:11.577
Camille:
Uh, sure there is!

00:11.712 --> 00:13.312
How you think cheese
got so delicious?

00:13.314 --> 00:15.980
Andrew:
So, what are we going to do?

00:16.017 --> 00:17.649
Camille: Maybe we could
sell some of your sneakers.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.352
Andrew:
Shh! They can hear you!

00:20.354 --> 00:22.921
I never thought my baby sneaks
becoming our best investment

00:22.923 --> 00:24.322
Would make
me so miserable.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.225
Camille: You did say
they would appreciate.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.527
Andrew:
I appreciate them!

00:28.596 --> 00:30.062
I guess I can sell a
few more pairs,

00:30.197 --> 00:32.230
But we're barely covering
this tasting dinner

00:32.266 --> 00:33.731
And the next
mortgage payment.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.335
Camille:
Maybe we can ask your parents?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.870
- (andrew sighing)
- or we could just cover it

00:38.939 --> 00:42.207
With plastic. I don't know.
I really can't cancel tonight,

00:42.342 --> 00:43.675
And I don't want
jully black

00:43.711 --> 00:46.211
And kardinal offishall
breathing in mold.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.214
Andrew: Hey, your tasting
dinner is going to go great.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.349
You'll book this
album launch party,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.084
And we'll get some
cash flow going!

00:52.219 --> 00:53.619
Camille:
Yeah. Sam did say

00:53.621 --> 00:55.920
It could lead to a bunch
more celebrity gigs.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.090
Andrew:
Eh, we love celebrities.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.826
More importantly, we
love celebrity mun-nay.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.361
- Camille: Mun-nay.
- Andrew: Mun-nay.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.497
- Camille: Mun-nay!
- Andrew: Mun-nay.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.235
Leo:
What you doing?

01:10.304 --> 01:13.105
Oh. Hey, buddy! Just a
little, uh, tcom.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.506
Taking care of mold.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.707
Shouldn't a professional
handle that?

01:15.843 --> 01:19.378
(laughing) probably, but
we got to save.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.780
Where'd all your shoes go?
Did we get robbed?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.782
Nah. I'm just selling
some kicks later.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.050
First the car,

01:25.185 --> 01:26.585
Now the shoes.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.320
Dad, are we okay?

01:28.455 --> 01:32.591
What? We're fine.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.793
Think of it as purging
with a purpose.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.830
We're totally fine, buddy.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.297

fine. (laughing)

dog on fire meme.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.538
Eh, you see
a dog on fire.

on heating bills.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.758

09:16.189 --> 09:18.123
Why? I paid
retail for them,

09:18.125 --> 09:20.324
And I flipped them for
500 bucks in profit.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.660
Every bit helps for normal
people, scrooge mcduck.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.995
You look like a
drug dealer!

09:24.130 --> 09:25.730
Ba, don't
be so dramatic.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.465
Linh:
Oh, yeah?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.035
- What is this?
- Uh, that's

09:30.037 --> 09:31.269
Just a Halloween
costume.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.071
Or is it mold
protection?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.739
- Andrew: What? No, carol.
- Linh: Mold?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.340
Sam:
Gold!

09:36.376 --> 09:37.942
This food is
gold, camille.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.611
(both chuckling)

09:39.746 --> 09:40.946
It's almost ready.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.547
- (voices arguing downstairs)
- caca.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.650
- Caw caw.
- (voices arguing downstairs)

09:45.785 --> 09:48.486
They seem tense. I shouldn't
have said "caw caw."

09:48.488 --> 09:49.621
Okay. Maybe you should
just go over there

09:49.690 --> 09:51.089
And, like,
warm them up.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.824
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe
I'll tell them

09:52.959 --> 09:55.160
When I got kicked out of drake's
tour bus. (gasping) or when I

09:55.295 --> 09:57.161
Snuck into michael bublé's
dentist appointment.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.163
- Okay. Yeah. Your call.
- Yeah. Okay. Which--

09:59.232 --> 10:00.231
- I don't know.
- Okay.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.132
(door closing)

10:03.937 --> 10:05.704
Sorry I'm late.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.239
- Mom, I made hudson cry.
- Oh, that's great, honey.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.643
Can you just go fill up
that water jug? Thank you.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.177
(whimpering)

10:13.213 --> 10:14.779
Sam:
(laughing) so, then-- so, then--

10:14.914 --> 10:16.313
So, I'm standing
there, right?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.315
And, uh, and
I says-- I go,

10:18.352 --> 10:21.519
"bublé, enough with
the crooning, you know?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.855
- Let's try some scat."
- kardinal: Ah, you see?

10:23.857 --> 10:26.724
Now, that's a name:
Crooning crows.

10:26.859 --> 10:29.360
You're just trying to go back
to the caca, aren't you?

10:29.495 --> 10:33.865
Okay. First up, a papri

10:33.934 --> 10:39.270

10:39.306 --> 10:41.940
So, are your

10:42.075 --> 10:43.207
You're too stubborn.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.209
Am I stubborn, or
am I right?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.278
Linh: It's not my fault
that you're broke!

11:42.269 --> 11:44.235
So, uh...

11:45.439 --> 11:47.338
Is that lisa's desk?

11:47.374 --> 11:51.543
Hudson: Yeah. We used to be
partners in life and--

11:51.678 --> 11:53.778
(sniffling) --business.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.812
I remember.

12:00.019 --> 12:04.088
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Okay. Once I sign,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.491
I get the accounting firm
and the house.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.759
She didn't
want either.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.294
I think she felt bad
for cheating.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.963
And honestly, I thought
I was over it all,

12:12.032 --> 12:15.033
But this
is so final.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.235
You know, it--
it makes me think

12:17.370 --> 12:19.437
About everything that
went wrong again.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.873
Cathy: I been there.
My divorce was super messy.

12:22.008 --> 12:25.309
You were married? I mean,
of course you were married.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.811
I'm sorry.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.313
Don't worry about it.
I was young.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.848
And stupid.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.983
And hot.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.252
And so stupid.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.321
(both laughing)

12:37.457 --> 12:39.690
Kardinal: You never have
my back! You remember the time

12:39.760 --> 12:42.227
I got dashed overboard
white-water rafting?

12:42.362 --> 12:45.196
- You laughed at me!
- That was 20 years ago,

12:45.232 --> 12:47.531
And it was funny!
(laughing)

12:47.567 --> 12:49.400
The universe
had your back.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.536
- (speaking foreign language)
- (speaking foreign language)

12:55.408 --> 12:57.008
What's going
on downstairs?

12:57.143 --> 13:00.411
Uh, someone must have left a
vietnamese soap opera on.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.814
They're really
intense.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.216
Khia, can you go
turn the volume down?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.618
Khia:
Yep.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.021
So, anyway, you can dip
the mini kebabs

13:10.090 --> 13:12.824
In the tamarind hot sauce
or the mint chutney.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.894
So, what
do you think?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.296
You know
what I think?

13:18.365 --> 13:21.098
Maybe we don't release
the album anymore!

13:21.134 --> 13:22.900
- What? No.
- Fine.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.370
Choclair's been trying to do
a collab with me, anyway!

13:26.505 --> 13:31.042
How dare you bring
kareem blake into this?

13:31.111 --> 13:33.111
Go on! See if
I care.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.113
If I may, we care.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.780
And so do your fans.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.317
Not that we're not fans
also, as well.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.120
Nah. Once
the vibes is off,

13:42.255 --> 13:44.222
You have to find
a new vibe.

13:44.357 --> 13:48.126
Um-- (clearing throat) --I can't
seem to get the volume down.

13:48.261 --> 13:52.130
The-- the show's a lot more...
Intense than we thought.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.065
Oh, wow.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.467
Linh: Maybe you should
start dealing drugs, then!

13:56.503 --> 13:59.069
- Andrew: Okay!
- (hissing)

13:59.205 --> 14:02.407
I need to check on the
rasgulla. I need a minute.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.743
Sam: Hey, have I-- have I ever
told you guys about the time

14:05.879 --> 14:08.445
That I stole sean-a paul's
dry cleaning?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.348
That was you?

14:10.483 --> 14:11.949
If you bought
the house we wanted,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.351
This wouldn't have
happened.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.354
Your money always
comes with strings!

14:16.356 --> 14:18.489
That's why I didn't take it
when we bought the house,

14:18.491 --> 14:20.291
And that's why
I'm not taking it now!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.098
Ba noi's not dead?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.108
What about dr. Yee?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.014
I had the best gums
he'd ever seen!

14:53.360 --> 14:54.325
Andrew!

14:59.165 --> 15:00.198
I believe in her!

15:00.200 --> 15:02.300
Andrew!

15:02.302 --> 15:03.968
Hey, babe!

15:03.970 --> 15:05.970
(in a loud whisper)
I was just talking about you.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.243
- What is going on down here?
- They won't stop trying

15:12.312 --> 15:14.345
- To give us money.
- Look. The album launch

15:14.347 --> 15:15.947
- Might not happen.
- What? Why?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.481
You made the mini
kebabs, right?

15:17.550 --> 15:20.318
No. They might cancel the
event altogether.

15:20.387 --> 15:24.789
Maybe it's not such a
bad idea to take their money.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.692
Camille, you too?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.159
I'm not doing it.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.297
Look. This dinner
might not work out,

15:32.432 --> 15:33.965
But something else will.

15:34.100 --> 15:34.966
(camille groaning)

15:35.035 --> 15:36.434
Or you want me to come up?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.835
I'm so good
at reuniting people.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.639
No, it's okay. I will try to
fix the vibe upstairs,

15:41.708 --> 15:43.708
But can you just lock
it down out here?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.142
- Yeah.
- Okay? Okay? It's not helping.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.511
- It's not helping!
- Not helping.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.945
Not.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.647
- Ow!
- Danh: Ooh! Oops.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.916
Leo!

15:51.918 --> 15:52.916
Hey, ông nôi.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.419
Hey, go,
go, go, go, go.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.458
Leo, my sweet boy!

16:00.460 --> 16:01.526
(speaking vietnamese)

16:03.830 --> 16:05.263
Carol:
Hey, little man.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.398
(leo speaking
vietnamese)

16:07.434 --> 16:09.600
Hey, buddy. Were you in
there the whole time?

16:09.602 --> 16:13.337
You bunged up? Or a little, uh,
mind palace situation?

16:13.406 --> 16:14.339
I guess.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.940
Did you
hear everything?

16:16.075 --> 16:17.675
Danh:
I can hear everything!

16:17.744 --> 16:18.943
(door opening)

16:19.078 --> 16:21.145
Hey, sometimes
money is stressful,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.880
But you don't need
to worry, okay?

16:22.949 --> 16:23.914
Okay.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.286
What's this?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.091
You want to go to
dance camp?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.492
No. That's okay.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.494
This is cool!
We'll get you in.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.962
It's 800 bucks.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.096
Oh, damn.

16:47.373 --> 16:48.839
Are you sure
you don't want to go?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.475
We could
figure something out.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.511
It's okay, dad. I don't want you
selling any more shoes.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.379
(sighing) buddy.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.785
You should never worry
about that.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.386
But what about
the mold?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.754
Carol:
Yeah, andrew.

17:03.889 --> 17:04.988
Where is this mold?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.057
It's not
down here, is it?

17:06.192 --> 17:07.859
Sure is. It's
right here.

17:07.994 --> 17:08.926
Andrew:
Leo, no!

17:10.296 --> 17:12.130
Everyone upstairs!

17:12.132 --> 17:13.531
(carol, linh
screaming)

17:13.600 --> 17:14.665
There's not enough room!

17:14.801 --> 17:16.000
Andrew, stop it!

17:16.135 --> 17:19.470
(screaming)

17:19.539 --> 17:21.005
Hey, man.
Rock and roll.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.540
Andrew, what is
going on?

17:22.609 --> 17:24.075
The mold is out, but
I closed the door.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.176
Everything is fine.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.944
Mold? The good kind?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.213
Or the bad kind?

17:29.215 --> 17:31.749
That's it. I'm done.
Yes, we have mold,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.618
The bad kind that
we can't afford to fix,

17:33.620 --> 17:36.820
And yes, I quit my safe job
months ago to start a business!

17:36.856 --> 17:38.890
And my in-laws want
to give us money to help,

17:38.892 --> 17:41.025
But my husband won't take
it! And that's fine,

17:41.160 --> 17:42.627
Because I got his back, and
that's what marriage is!

17:42.762 --> 17:44.429
And now, the biggest
clients we've ever had

17:44.564 --> 17:46.297
Might fall through because of
vibes, and I don't know

17:46.366 --> 17:49.100
- If I can keep doing this!
- (hissing)

17:49.235 --> 17:51.835
Camille, can I give you
a little advice?

17:51.871 --> 17:55.439
- Yes, please, jully black.
- You doing any self-care?

17:55.574 --> 17:58.576
Like sitting in the basement,
eating m&ms with the lights off

17:58.578 --> 18:00.277
- So no one knows you're there?
- Sometimes,

18:00.346 --> 18:03.113
But more like
massages, meditation.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.048
You should look into
that, girl.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.783
You know what? It
probably didn't help

18:06.820 --> 18:09.353
That me and jully have been
beefing all night, either.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.590
Well, you know
what would help?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.725
Is if you kept
the album release.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.260
And hired us
to do it.

18:16.395 --> 18:17.862
That part.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.497
You clearly care about
it, and each other.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.032
You fight
like siblings.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.035
- My sister's the worst.
- (chuckling)

18:25.105 --> 18:28.238
Hey, what if you do a
track for us, here, now?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.541
Like a little test
audience?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.111
Only if you come to my
next step class with me.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.812
- Done.
- Can I come, too?

18:36.482 --> 18:39.217
Here we go. Here we
go. Here we go. Ready?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.351
Three, two, one.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.319
Bam!

18:44.457 --> 18:45.590
- Whoo!
- Boom!

18:45.592 --> 18:46.891
Boo-yah!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.226

18:48.228 --> 18:50.161

18:50.296 --> 18:53.497
Cheers... To the end
of an era...

18:53.533 --> 18:54.598
And the beginning

19:12.919 --> 19:14.785
So, how about it?

happy for you.

19:33.106 --> 19:36.073
But growing a
business takes time.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.476
Job-to-job life
is hard life.

19:38.478 --> 19:42.079
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to help your son.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.153
Okay. I'll do it.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.557

19:55.628 --> 19:58.095
No string.
All good, man.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.579

20:17.984 --> 20:20.718
Uh, hey, so,

20:20.853 --> 20:23.254
Our emotions and feelings
and all that junk,

20:23.323 --> 20:26.423
I think it's a good time to tell
you that my boyfriend's here.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.793
- What?
- What? Carol's got a boyfriend?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.261
I wonder if it's

20:36.836 --> 20:40.004

20:40.073 --> 20:43.173
Wait. Is this how you
knew what was going on with us?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.209
Camille, did you
tell nikhil?

20:45.211 --> 20:46.544
No, fool.
You told me

20:46.679 --> 20:48.546
When you tried to
sell me those jordans

20:48.681 --> 20:50.347

- Nikhil: I don't like it

21:16.442 --> 21:19.576
