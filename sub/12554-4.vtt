CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road</i>
<i>is where Sarah</i>
<i>Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:09.142
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:15.849
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>supercomputer in the wall,</i>

00:15.915 --> 00:19.753
<i>her son, a genetically</i>
<i>engineered boy genius,</i>

00:19.819 --> 00:22.322
<i>a schoolgirl investigator</i>
<i>across the road,</i>

00:22.389 --> 00:24.290
<i>her adopted daughter</i>
<i>from another world</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.926

00:29.629 --> 00:30.597
(SCREAMS)

00:46.112 --> 00:47.847
-Ready?
-Always.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.587
-Do you know
anything about curses?
-Native American curses?

00:54.788 --> 00:57.123
All day,
every one of my friends
has been turning against me.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.391
-Rani, we're mates.
-I hate you.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.593
Get out!

01:00.660 --> 01:02.095
I think there's something
wrong with my name.
It's like it's cursed.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.897
I don't ever want
to hear his name again!

01:08.234 --> 01:11.037
-Mum, I love you.
Please, don't do this.
-I want you out of my life!

01:11.104 --> 01:13.640
I haven't done anything.
It's the curse!
It's taking everything over!

01:46.873 --> 01:48.575
Hiya. Sleep all right?

01:53.112 --> 01:54.614
You'll get used to it.
At least it's dry.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.820
What was you thinking,
kipping out
in the rain? Want to get sick?

02:02.889 --> 02:04.858
It's not like
things can get any worse.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.527
If you want to try pneumonia,
go for it.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.331
No,
look, I'm sorry, it's just...

02:11.397 --> 02:13.666
This is all sort of new to me.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.870
But thanks for
bringing me here.

02:25.612 --> 02:29.048
I saw you
the other day, you know.
You gave me a couple of quid.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.317
CLYDE: Oh, outside the museum?

02:31.384 --> 02:32.952
I'm sorry, I didn't recognise
you.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.722
Course not. People don't look.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.825
-Scared they
might catch something.
-No, it's not that.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.793
I saw them chuck you out.

02:40.860 --> 02:44.931
What did you do, unravel
a bit of a mummy
to blow your nose?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.467
That's not the only place
I got thrown out of.

02:47.534 --> 02:51.671
Look, if you've had a row
with your folks, go home.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.941
With any luck, you'll be nice
and warm in bed tonight.

02:55.008 --> 02:55.975
Spare us a thought.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.279
Yeah, but I've got no one.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.348
My mum,
my friends, they're history.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.817
You're the first person
that hasn't turned on me.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.759
I'm Ellie Faber.
What about you?

03:20.233 --> 03:21.868
Enrico.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.771
Enrico Box.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.108
Okay.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.151
(GRUMBLING)

03:41.721 --> 03:43.623
-What are you doing?
-Having a clear-out.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.559
-There's too much
clutter in this attic.
-But those are Clyde's things.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.595
Well,
he should have taken them
with him. Too late now.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.598
I don't understand.
What did he do to
upset you so much?

03:51.664 --> 03:55.001
Listen to me, Sky,
and remember, I don't want to
hear his name again

03:55.068 --> 03:57.870
and I don't want you to have
anything to do with him.
Is that clear?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.974
-Yeah.
-Good.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.131
CLYDE: So how long
have you been
living like this?

04:25.198 --> 04:25.932
ELLIE: Two years.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.901
Time doesn't mean much here.

04:30.069 --> 04:30.937
How?

04:32.839 --> 04:36.876
My dad died
and my mum married again.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.781
Let's just say
it didn't work out
for me. Okay?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.685
I'm sorry.

04:45.752 --> 04:49.689
Doesn't matter.
You grow up fast out here.

04:49.756 --> 04:50.823
There's a load of
stuff that happens...

04:50.890 --> 04:52.158
What sort of stuff?

04:53.926 --> 04:56.396
Oh, well,
it's like everywhere else.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.864
There's good
people and there's bad.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.134
And there's the Night Dragon.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.640
-What's that?
-Sometimes people disappear.

05:07.707 --> 05:10.576
I mean, how bad is that?
We've already vanished once.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.914
Well, maybe they find
somewhere to go?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.382
And don't tell anybody
they're going?

05:17.383 --> 05:19.185
They're just gone.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.055
And then the next
morning people say
the Night Dragon took them.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.658
And they never come back.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.239
School chips.
Best chips in the world.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.008
The menu said
there was toad in the hole.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.478
Mr Smith said there are
500 species of toad.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.747
When I asked which
one we were having,

05:47.814 --> 05:50.883
the dinner lady
didn't seem very pleased.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.287
So Mr Smith gave you a basic
grounding for starting school

05:54.353 --> 05:57.790
by telling you about toads
and nothing
about school dinners?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.026
Hmm. Sounds just like him.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.928
I think he's
still nervous of me.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.530
He doesn't like me getting
too close, just in case I
blow his circuits.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.633
He'll get used to you.
You're one of the gang now.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.105
-Like Clyde?
-Don't say that!

06:12.171 --> 06:14.640
He was your friend,
and Sarah Jane's.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.409
She says
everything has a reason

06:16.476 --> 06:18.411
but no one can
give me a reason
why you all turned on Clyde.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.712
I don't feel well.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.121
I looked you up on the
internet after you came
to interview me.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.691
You have a reputation as
a journalist for investigating
strange phenomena,

06:31.758 --> 06:34.727
so I thought maybe
you'd come across
something like this before.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.130
-What happened?
-According to
our security guard,

06:37.196 --> 06:39.265
lightning burst out
of the totem pole.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.300
Well, that's impossible.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.636
Of course, but I'm almost
thinking there's truth in
the legend after all.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.371
(WHIRRING)

06:46.739 --> 06:48.674
-But it was dead...
-The myth says

06:48.741 --> 06:50.109
the medicine men
of the great plains

06:50.176 --> 06:52.411
trapped the god Hetocumtek
in the totem pole,

06:52.478 --> 06:55.481
but warns that Hetocumtek
would find a way to escape

06:55.548 --> 06:58.284
if ever
the totem pole fell back
into the hands of men.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.787
That's why it was
hidden deep in a cave
in Death Valley.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.789
Well, it's only a legend.

07:02.855 --> 07:03.990
(MOBILE RINGING)

07:05.491 --> 07:06.826
No, it's...

07:09.262 --> 07:12.465
Dr Madigan, I think it might
be best if you close
the exhibition for a while.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.734
-Just as a precaution.
-Okay. Yes, of course.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.209
You got any
spare change, mate?

07:23.276 --> 07:26.412
So you do this every day?
Even in the rain?

07:26.479 --> 07:28.748
Well,
you're hungry, I'm hungry.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.850
It's either this
or going through the bins.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.587
Yeah, I've done that, too.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.423
Have you got any
spare change, mate?

07:37.490 --> 07:40.293
Not like that. You sound like
you're flogging china
down the market.

07:40.359 --> 07:43.029
-Too cocky.
-It's not cocky,
it's charisma.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.031
Whoever heard of
a homeless person
having charisma?

07:48.668 --> 07:52.371
This is how it goes, isn't it?

07:52.438 --> 07:55.408
Everything you ever were,
everything you
ever wanted to be,

07:55.474 --> 07:58.744
it just gets worn away
till there's nothing left.

07:58.811 --> 08:03.749
The people that make it
were always fighters.
Survivors.

08:03.816 --> 08:09.589
I'm one of them.
You wouldn't believe
some of the things I've done,

08:09.655 --> 08:13.392
-creatures I've seen.
-Creatures?
Are you into wildlife, then?

08:14.527 --> 08:17.530
Yeah. It was a wild life.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.101
Let's go get something to eat.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.847
MR SMITH:
<i>Are you all right, Sarah Jane?</i>

08:37.350 --> 08:38.116
Yeah.

08:39.986 --> 08:44.090
Something about that
totem pole. It's alive,
Mr Smith, I saw it.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.058
Just for a moment.
I know I did.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.196
There's something terrible.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.531
<i>It must have been dormant</i>
<i>during your first</i>
<i>visit to the museum.</i>

08:52.598 --> 08:55.167
<i>However, there are now</i>
<i>energies building around</i>
<i>the totem pole.</i>

08:55.234 --> 08:58.437
But why?
That's what worries me.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.551
That's Max.
He used to be a boxer,
then he got too old.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.021
He's been on
the streets years.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.322
That woman in the duffle coat,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.557
Polish or something,
came over to get married.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.427
Got dumped, can't get home.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.230
And that's Polly the Porsche.
She used to work in the City.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.565
Always telling everyone
what she used to drive.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.435
Now she pushes
everything she's got
around in an old trolley.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.704
No way.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.140
All of them,
ignoring us on the street.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.442
They wouldn't believe
how easy it could be.

09:36.509 --> 09:40.012
One day it just
all falls apart
and you're here,

09:40.079 --> 09:42.815
Steven's Point,
getting handouts.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.719
All right, Mags?
How's the tea leaves?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.623
Hello, love.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.960
ELLIE: This is Mystic Mags.
This is my friend Rico.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.162
If you want to know the
numbers for the lottery,
she's your girl.

09:56.228 --> 10:00.666
Mock, but there's
strange things in the air.

10:00.733 --> 10:04.804
-Yeah, like fish.
-Something bad's coming!

10:04.870 --> 10:09.742
-You mean the Night Dragon?
-Aagh! The dragon's coming.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.312
I can see it in the leaves.

10:13.379 --> 10:17.984
It's always in the leaves
before one of us is taken.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.087
But this isn't no dragon.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.556
Something else.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.496
And it's put its mark on you.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.835
-What?
-There's a curse on you

10:35.901 --> 10:39.038
and everyone what knows you.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.874
Cut it out, Mags.

10:43.109 --> 10:45.845
She's right.

10:45.911 --> 10:49.348
-She's right, I'm cursed.
-What are you talking about?

10:49.415 --> 10:52.251
Look, I'm only
ever going to get you
into trouble, Ellie.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.521
Thanks for trying to help me
but you can't, no one can.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.458
Hey, wait!

11:01.093 --> 11:05.564
-Rico! Rico, wait!
-My name's not Rico.

11:05.631 --> 11:09.635
What? Your name's
not really Enrico Box?
Who'd have guessed?

11:09.702 --> 11:11.670
It doesn't matter.

11:11.737 --> 11:15.541
I can't tell you my name.
She was right.

11:15.608 --> 11:19.311
What, you're cursed?
Look at me.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.713
Welcome to the club!

11:21.947 --> 11:23.849
BOY: Loser!
CLYDE: Watch it!

11:26.052 --> 11:29.622
See? You can't be cursed.
You're my lucky charm.

11:50.509 --> 11:53.646
-Are you coming
down with something?
-No, I'm fine.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.849
You've not said a word since
we've left the shops.
Come on, what's wrong?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.152
Rani. Love, what is it?

12:02.855 --> 12:04.457
I don't know.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.862
It's like something's wrong.

12:12.932 --> 12:16.836
It feels like
I've lost something
really special,

12:16.902 --> 12:19.438
only I don't know what it is.

12:20.606 --> 12:21.807
That doesn't make any sense.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.910
I know it doesn't.
And it's driving me mad.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.547
But I can't shake it.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.953
It's like
nothing's right any more.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.358
My whole life,
Dad, it's like...

12:39.425 --> 12:41.093
It's like it's
not me any more.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.866
(RANI SNIFFLING)

12:51.937 --> 12:56.509
So, how are you settling
in with Sarah Jane?
Have you met Luke yet?

12:56.575 --> 12:58.978
He's such a lovely boy.
He was such big
friends with...

13:02.314 --> 13:05.718
-Mrs Langer?
-This keeps happening to me.

13:05.784 --> 13:09.388
Something comes
into my head and...
I don't know what.

13:09.455 --> 13:14.460
It's like a part of my world
has gone and...
I don't know what it is.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.263
-Is it Clyde?
-Don't use that
name in my house!

13:17.329 --> 13:18.864
Why? I don't understand.

13:18.931 --> 13:22.368
Everybody's turned against him
but nobody can tell me why!

13:22.434 --> 13:23.636
Just be glad he's gone!

13:23.702 --> 13:25.571
But Clyde's your son.
Don't you love him?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.208
-I told you,
don't say that name!
-It's just a name, Mrs Langer.

13:29.275 --> 13:33.546
-Clyde is your son's name.
-It hurts! Stop saying it!

13:33.612 --> 13:37.583
That's it! It's his name,
his name's doing all this.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.119
It's going to be
all right, Mrs Langer.
Somehow, I promise.

Just wetter.

people superstitious.

have told everyone
you're cursed.

You know the one I mean.
No one's ever going
to forget that day.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.724
I was at school.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.792
I was on the street

14:53.859 --> 14:57.162
and then this fish
drops between my feet.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.030
Splat!

14:59.531 --> 15:01.800
It was totally random.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.803
Well, at least you had
something to eat.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.905
Yeah, like I know what to do
with a fish.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.875
Might as well
have rained bricks.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.278
Someone said it was
some weird weather thing.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.847
Yeah, I heard that, too.

15:14.913 --> 15:18.651
So, what if the fish
was some sort of sign

15:18.717 --> 15:22.421
that something bad was coming,
like Mystic Mags said?

15:23.689 --> 15:27.860
-Worse than the Night Dragon?
-Yeah, really bad.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.565
I've been through
bad stuff in my life.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.735
-Maybe it doesn't matter now.
-I don't understand.

15:38.704 --> 15:44.043
Two years I've been telling
myself I'll get
off the street.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.911
I'll get on some
sort of scheme.

15:47.012 --> 15:49.581
Get a job, get a flat.

15:49.648 --> 15:50.983
Get my life back.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.420
Meet a nice boy.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.859
That was my dream.
Now it's
starting to come true.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.038
(THUNDER CRACKS)

16:15.307 --> 16:17.076
(GROWLING)

16:20.946 --> 16:23.749
It feels like someone has died
but you don't know who,

16:23.816 --> 16:26.852
like someone really special
has been taken from you.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.989
-Yeah, that's it.
That's exactly it!
-Yeah, I'm feeling it, too.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.560
-What's going on?
-Something really weird.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.930
The only thing I can think
is it's something to do
with that totem pole.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.998
There's an energy in it,
it's been dormant

16:40.065 --> 16:41.867
but it's getting
stronger all the time.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.370
Getting stronger? Since when?

16:44.436 --> 16:47.339
Oh, sometime after we all
went to the museum.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.309
Since Clyde
touched the totem pole?

16:50.376 --> 16:52.244
-Since he got the splinter?
-Don't say that name!

16:52.311 --> 16:53.512
Mr Smith, I need you!

16:53.579 --> 16:54.880
Oh! What are you doing?

16:54.947 --> 16:57.883
It's the only way
I can make you listen to me!

16:57.950 --> 17:00.919
Mr Smith, when Clyde got
the splinter
from the totem pole,

17:00.986 --> 17:03.856
-could that have
activated its energy?
-Stop saying that!

17:03.922 --> 17:06.759
<i>-It is conceivable.</i>
-None of this
makes sense, Sky.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.560
You turning your back on Clyde
doesn't make sense!

17:09.627 --> 17:13.832
Even his mum's thrown him out.
She feels just the same way
you and Rani do,

17:13.898 --> 17:15.267
like something's been
torn out of her life

17:15.334 --> 17:16.835
and she can't remember
what it is.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.570
Well, it isn't him.
I hate him!

17:19.637 --> 17:22.340
Why, Rani? Think about it.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.710
You both love Clyde.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.246
You'd never turn
your backs on him.

17:27.311 --> 17:30.582
The only way this could
happen is some alien
messing with your heads.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.652
-Clyde needs us.
-Stop saying
that name, please!

17:33.719 --> 17:37.723
<i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>your reaction to his name</i>
<i>suggests that Sky is correct.</i>

17:37.790 --> 17:40.859
<i>You have been subjected to</i>
<i>a psychophonic programming,</i>

17:40.926 --> 17:43.328
<i>possibly designed</i>
<i>to keep Clyde isolated.</i>

17:43.395 --> 17:47.299
-Well, say that's true. Why?
-Because
Hetocumtek needs Clyde.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.168
What if it's
found a way to escape?

17:49.234 --> 17:52.438
The longer Clyde's out there,
the more
powerful it's getting.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.674
The legend said

17:55.741 --> 17:58.310
that if the totem pole
fell back into
the hands of men,

17:58.377 --> 18:00.078
then Hetocumtek would escape.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.313
Hands of men!

18:01.380 --> 18:03.048
Clyde got a splinter.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.184
It's a curse
and you've got to break it!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.820
That name.
Just the sound
of it, it's agony.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.221
<i>It hurts!</i>

18:09.288 --> 18:12.157
His name's the key.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.994
His mum couldn't say it. Maybe
if you can,
it will break the curse.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.907
Oh, it's no good.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.610
You've got to!
We've got to find Clyde!

18:31.677 --> 18:33.879
It's the only way of stopping
Hetocumtek escaping!

18:36.849 --> 18:39.918
-We can do this, Rani.
-It's just a name.
We can say it, right?

18:42.421 --> 18:43.789
Okay...

18:43.856 --> 18:46.859
Say it! Say it! Come on.
Clyde Langer. Clyde Langer.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.632
Clyde...

18:55.934 --> 18:57.236
Clyde...

18:57.302 --> 18:58.871
Clyde...

18:58.937 --> 19:00.606
Clyde...

19:02.007 --> 19:03.809
-Clyde...
-Clyde Langer!

19:03.876 --> 19:06.311
-Clyde...
-Clyde...

19:06.378 --> 19:08.981
-Clyde Langer!
-Clyde Langer!

19:09.047 --> 19:12.284
-Clyde Langer! Clyde Langer!
-Clyde Langer! Clyde Langer!

19:12.351 --> 19:14.419
Oh! Clyde Langer!

19:17.623 --> 19:19.024
Oh...

19:19.091 --> 19:22.461
Now, the most important thing
is we get Clyde back.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.397
(GROWLING)

19:31.336 --> 19:33.872
Look. What do you think?

19:35.207 --> 19:36.642
(LAUGHS)

19:36.708 --> 19:38.877
That's brilliant.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.646
You know, I know I was
thinking, I could do this,
like a street artist.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.548
We could go up
to Covent Garden
or somewhere

19:42.614 --> 19:46.084
and people will pay
to have their portraits drawn.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.588
-On the back of
old paper bags?
-No, I'll get a drawing pad.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.758
I've already got the pencils.
I'm telling you,
Ellie, we can do this.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.626
We can get off
the streets together.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.370
Stay here. I'm going to go
and get us a coffee to share.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.772
I feel like celebrating.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.108
-(TYRES SCREECH)
-Okay.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.045
Clyde!

20:13.111 --> 20:14.413

20:15.314 --> 20:16.815
-Rani?
-Clyde!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.486
(RANI LAUGHS)

20:21.553 --> 20:24.423
I'm so sorry.
What have I done?

20:24.489 --> 20:27.259
Oh! We've been looking
for you all night.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.261
You have to thank Sky.
The curse didn't affect her.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.364
-She fought so hard for you.
-Thank you, Sparky.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.666
Something alien is trapped
in the totem pole

20:34.733 --> 20:36.668
and somehow it's
using you to get free.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.870
And if it does, we are
in trouble.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.238
But we need you back
at the attic.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.608
But I've got to
wait for someone,
my friend!

20:42.674 --> 20:44.276
Clyde, there isn't time!
We have to go!

20:44.343 --> 20:46.111
But I can't leave her.
You don't understand.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.814
We have to go, Clyde!
We have to go. Please!

20:50.315 --> 20:51.149
-Ellie?
-Oh...

20:52.351 --> 20:54.786
-Ellie!
-Clyde, listen to me!

20:54.853 --> 20:56.855
That thing could break free
at any moment!

21:01.460 --> 21:02.594
I'm coming back.

everything and everyone

Come here.

I love you, Clyde.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.626
She's not here.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.528
London's a big city, Clyde.
Ellie could be anywhere.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.598
I've got to find her.
Come on,
let's try Steven's Point.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.834
Her name's Ellie.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.870
Sixteen or 17,
with a green coat.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.206
Have you seen this girl?

23:28.273 --> 23:29.875
-Have you seen her around?
-No, sorry, mate.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.744
-Have you seen this girl?
-Nah.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.718
She was the only
friend I had when...
when you all turned on me.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.388
And now she thinks I abandoned
her like everyone else,
but I haven't!

23:43.455 --> 23:44.923
I won't, not ever.

23:47.692 --> 23:50.128
-I will find her.
-I know, Clyde.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.567
I just can't believe,
after all
the things we've seen,

23:55.634 --> 23:58.870
the most alien world of all
is right here.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.706
And no one knows.
Because they don't want to.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.379
Mate, have you seen this girl?

24:08.914 --> 24:11.049
-No, mate.
-All right.
then. Thanks anyway.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.854
We can find her, can't we?

24:16.054 --> 24:18.757
I mean, we've got Mr Smith.
We find aliens.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.926
We help them get home,
right across
the universe but...

24:22.260 --> 24:24.462
We can help Ellie, can't we?
We can find her.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.169
"Ellie Faber."

24:31.236 --> 24:33.872
It wasn't her name.
She just took it
off some old poster.

The Night Dragon took her.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.585
What,
that was the Night Dragon?
A truck?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.119
Comes by every so often.

give you a lift,

Dublin, France, Germany...

24:53.491 --> 24:55.961
They go all over the place.

24:56.027 --> 24:59.865
It's another chance.
That's why people go.
