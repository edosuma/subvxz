01:02.699 --> 01:05.766
<i>Life, extraordinary,</i>

01:09.035 --> 01:10.144
<i>people.</i>

01:11.345 --> 01:14.841
<i>I can't say why</i>

01:14.876 --> 01:17.613
<i>people fascinate me</i>
<i>so much.</i>

01:18.847 --> 01:20.385
<i>If I had to give a reason,</i>

01:21.784 --> 01:23.454
<i>it's because</i>

01:23.489 --> 01:25.852
<i>we're so different,</i>

01:25.887 --> 01:28.822
<i>each and every one of us.</i>

01:31.728 --> 01:33.365
<i>Isn't it amazing to know</i>

01:34.632 --> 01:36.335
<i>there's not another version</i>
<i>of you?</i>

01:37.701 --> 01:39.030
<i>There was only you.</i>

01:43.069 --> 01:45.410
<i>That's what's fascinating,</i>

01:47.744 --> 01:50.041
<i>especially women.</i>

01:55.081 --> 01:58.654
<i>What do these images</i>
<i>remind you of?</i>

02:03.694 --> 02:05.958
<i>Women.</i>

02:05.993 --> 02:09.533
<i>So complex, but so perfect.</i>

02:11.537 --> 02:14.505
<i>To understand them is like</i>
<i>trying to understand income tax.</i>

02:16.168 --> 02:17.871
<i>Exactly.</i>

02:17.906 --> 02:21.072
<i>No one gets it, but I do.</i>

02:22.207 --> 02:24.174
<i>Not income tax,</i>

02:24.209 --> 02:26.385
<i>women.</i>

02:26.420 --> 02:28.585
<i>Her, for example.</i>

02:29.885 --> 02:32.116
<i>Just look at her.</i>

02:35.264 --> 02:37.198
<i>Look how perfect she is.</i>

02:38.894 --> 02:40.927
<i>It's like</i>
<i>she was designed by Apple.</i>

02:42.535 --> 02:45.965
<i>Is she happy with him</i>
<i>in this moment?</i>

02:50.202 --> 02:53.478
<i>She's smiling,</i>
<i>but looking closely,</i>

02:54.613 --> 02:57.108
<i>her eyes,</i>

02:57.143 --> 02:58.780
<i>there's uncertainty.</i>

03:00.146 --> 03:01.651
<i>She doesn't fully trust him.</i>

03:03.248 --> 03:05.721
<i>Every time he speaks,</i>
<i>she lifts her head</i>

03:05.756 --> 03:07.085
<i>and squints her eyes.</i>

03:08.495 --> 03:10.528
<i>This could also mean</i>
<i>she's intrigued by him,</i>

03:10.563 --> 03:12.827
<i>but it's not the case here.</i>

03:14.468 --> 03:17.062
<i>This woman, for example,</i>

03:17.097 --> 03:19.504
<i>this is what intrigue</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

03:21.475 --> 03:23.574
<i>The difference is that</i>
<i>after she raises her head</i>

03:23.609 --> 03:25.807
<i>and squints her eyes,</i>

03:25.842 --> 03:28.073
<i>there's a slight adjustment</i>
<i>to her head.</i>

03:28.108 --> 03:30.977
<i>She brings it back down</i>
<i>only a little bit.</i>

03:32.277 --> 03:33.782
<i>This.</i>

03:33.817 --> 03:35.718
<i>This tells us</i>
<i>she's not only intrigued,</i>

03:35.753 --> 03:37.786
<i>but wants something.</i>

03:38.954 --> 03:40.954
<i>What does she want?</i>

03:40.989 --> 03:42.956
<i>With silence,</i>

03:42.991 --> 03:44.925
<i>I get answers.</i>

03:44.960 --> 03:47.598
<i>Silence says many things</i>

03:47.633 --> 03:49.028
<i>without saying anything.</i>

03:50.262 --> 03:52.130
<i>Next comes...</i>

03:52.165 --> 03:54.308
Why are you looking at me
like that?

03:54.343 --> 03:55.474
I'm just looking.

03:56.642 --> 03:57.839
Anything new?

03:59.480 --> 04:00.743
Few things.

04:00.778 --> 04:02.140
Like?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.779
Your perfume.

04:03.814 --> 04:04.912
That's new.

04:04.947 --> 04:06.353
Stop deflecting.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.552
You know what I'm talking
about with you.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.116
<i>It's all over her face.</i>

04:11.151 --> 04:12.854
<i>She wants me,</i>

04:14.462 --> 04:15.626
<i>and she's looking forward</i>
<i>to the day</i>

04:15.661 --> 04:17.023
<i>when it finally happens.</i>

04:19.566 --> 04:20.895
<i>But I want something else.</i>

04:24.802 --> 04:26.098
You know what?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.473
I'm, uh,
I'm getting a little tired.

04:27.508 --> 04:29.167
I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.707
- Okay,
I'll walk you out.

04:30.742 --> 04:32.170
No, no, no, I'm good.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.347
Thank you.

04:33.382 --> 04:34.480
Have a good night.

04:34.515 --> 04:35.745
You, too.

04:37.716 --> 04:39.881
- ...wine, champagne
or whatever you want.

04:41.753 --> 04:43.181
<i>There are people</i>
<i>in this world</i>

04:43.216 --> 04:45.216
<i>who ignore</i>
<i>their natural instincts,</i>

04:46.659 --> 04:49.396
<i>our instincts of wanting more.</i>

04:51.158 --> 04:53.158
<i>In Las Vegas,</i>
<i>people tend to let go</i>

04:53.193 --> 04:56.403
<i>and live almost carefree,</i>

04:56.438 --> 04:58.867
<i>which is why I fit in so well.</i>

05:00.673 --> 05:03.003
<i>I can fulfill</i>
<i>my darkest desires,</i>

05:03.038 --> 05:05.841
<i>and no one will even notice.</i>

05:21.221 --> 05:23.254
<i>I promise,</i>
<i>it isn't what it looks like.</i>

06:20.621 --> 06:21.686
<i>Perfect.</i>

06:33.997 --> 06:35.161
Okay, okay, okay.

06:37.803 --> 06:38.967
Come on.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.514
I'm just gonna go
freshen up, okay?

07:36.191 --> 07:37.498
<i>Damn!</i>

07:38.831 --> 07:40.193
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

07:42.703 --> 07:44.230
<i>This shouldn't have happened.</i>

07:48.071 --> 07:49.576
<i>Couldn't help myself.</i>

08:02.921 --> 08:04.591
<i>What are you doing?</i>

08:20.565 --> 08:21.740
- Wait.

08:23.744 --> 08:25.172
- What are you doing?

08:25.207 --> 08:27.042
Go away!

08:27.077 --> 08:28.714
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

08:30.146 --> 08:31.475
You don't want to be here.

08:33.050 --> 08:34.951
You're right.

08:34.986 --> 08:36.854
I don't.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.086
You should leave.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.825
I think we both should.

08:44.127 --> 08:45.390
Leave or I'll jump.

08:47.592 --> 08:49.493
I'm sure you don't want
to be here anymore than I do.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.103
Don't be so sure.

08:56.909 --> 08:59.437
I'm sure that
wherever you were, you,

08:59.472 --> 09:00.812
uh, you left in a bit of a rush.

09:00.847 --> 09:04.409
You don't have a jacket,
got no purse.

09:06.985 --> 09:08.512
-Why don't we just-
-Don't!

09:10.791 --> 09:11.955
Okay.

09:13.695 --> 09:16.355
All I'm saying is,
you're not alone.

09:18.194 --> 09:20.799
Now that you have
a moment, just...

09:20.834 --> 09:22.295
just think about
what you're doing.

09:26.972 --> 09:28.741
I'm...

09:28.776 --> 09:30.534
I'm sorry about this,
I have to, I have to take this.

09:31.944 --> 09:33.603
Hello.

09:33.638 --> 09:35.308
Hey, Mama.
You okay?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.685
Okay, great. Let me, let me
give you a call back, okay?

09:40.612 --> 09:41.853
Because I'm with a friend
and I,

09:41.888 --> 09:43.052
and I don't want to be rude.

09:44.990 --> 09:46.057
With who?

09:49.126 --> 09:50.125
Emma.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.995
Emma.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.832
I'm with Emma, Ma.

09:55.627 --> 09:58.364
No, we actually, uh,
we just met. Listen, I'm...

09:58.399 --> 10:00.003
I'm trying to help her
with something right now.

10:00.038 --> 10:01.400
I'mma give you
a call back, okay?

10:02.843 --> 10:05.041
Okay.
I love you, too.

10:05.076 --> 10:06.174
All right.

10:07.408 --> 10:08.847
I'm sorry about that.

10:08.882 --> 10:10.178
If, if it wasn't my mama,

10:10.213 --> 10:12.015
I wouldn't have picked up
right now.

10:13.678 --> 10:16.118
Um...

10:16.153 --> 10:18.054
Emma, is it possible
that we can maybe

10:18.089 --> 10:19.891
go somewhere and, and talk?

10:23.325 --> 10:25.666
<i>I pay attention to things</i>
<i>most people don't see,</i>

10:27.560 --> 10:30.132
<i>but I see you, Emma.</i>

10:30.167 --> 10:32.398
<i>I treat her place</i>
<i>as if it's my own</i>

10:32.433 --> 10:33.872
<i>to make her more comfortable.</i>

10:35.106 --> 10:37.040
Uh, where's your light?

10:37.075 --> 10:38.745
-Over here.
-Okay.

10:40.342 --> 10:41.407
Leave it.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.817
Okay.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.984
I'mma go grab you
some blankets

10:47.019 --> 10:48.678
or something, okay?

10:48.713 --> 10:51.186
And we can talk about
whatever you want to talk about.

10:54.961 --> 10:56.092
It's okay.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.228
We all go through things, okay?

11:00.263 --> 11:01.328
I've been there.

11:01.363 --> 11:02.428
We all have.

11:10.141 --> 11:12.042
<i>I'm not taking</i>
<i>advantage of this woman.</i>

11:16.378 --> 11:17.718
<i>This isn't for me.</i>

11:22.582 --> 11:24.120
<i>This is for her.</i>

11:28.720 --> 11:30.588
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>she needs this.</i>

11:33.593 --> 11:34.801
<i>She's broken.</i>

11:39.104 --> 11:41.005
<i>And I'm her temporary fix,</i>

11:45.946 --> 11:47.176
<i>just a moment,</i>

11:51.952 --> 11:53.446
<i>a feeling...</i>

11:57.925 --> 11:59.584
<i>she wishes can last forever.</i>

12:28.351 --> 12:31.924
<i>Last night was definitely</i>
<i>an unusual night for me.</i>

12:31.959 --> 12:33.354
<i>But what happened, happened</i>

12:33.389 --> 12:34.718
<i>so I can be there for her.</i>

12:40.396 --> 12:43.804
<i>"Emma, I'm sorry I had to leave.</i>

12:45.368 --> 12:47.808
<i>"You looked so comfortable</i>
<i>and I didn't want to wake you.</i>

12:49.207 --> 12:51.845
<i>"What a night we shared.</i>

12:51.880 --> 12:55.013
<i>"It feels as if it was meant</i>
<i>to be because</i>

12:55.048 --> 12:57.609
<i>"we both needed someone.</i>

12:57.644 --> 12:59.380
<i>"Thank you for being</i>
<i>there for me.</i>

13:00.988 --> 13:02.823
<i>"Stop reading and look</i>
<i>under your pillow.</i>

13:04.816 --> 13:08.653
<i>"Don't think of this as charity</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

13:08.688 --> 13:12.525
<i>"Look at it as a thank you</i>
<i>for an experience</i>

13:12.560 --> 13:13.834
<i>"that was priceless.</i>

13:15.101 --> 13:17.431
<i>"It's not much,</i>
<i>but I hope this helps.</i>

13:18.907 --> 13:20.236
<i>"You take care of yourself."</i>

13:25.276 --> 13:26.880
<i>Money,</i>

13:26.915 --> 13:29.344
<i>the root of all evil,</i>

13:29.379 --> 13:30.741
<i>almost made us loser.</i>

13:32.085 --> 13:34.745
<i>Money is never my go-to,</i>

13:34.780 --> 13:37.682
<i>but in this case,</i>
<i>it was necessary.</i>

13:37.717 --> 13:40.025
<i>It possibly saved her life.</i>

13:40.060 --> 13:42.060
<i>I'll never know.</i>

13:42.095 --> 13:43.226
<i>It's best that way.</i>

13:44.559 --> 13:46.658
<i>I live in the moment.</i>

13:46.693 --> 13:48.726
<i>Last night we had a moment.</i>

13:50.268 --> 13:53.698
<i>Now that moment is over,</i>
<i>it's time to move on.</i>

14:12.620 --> 14:14.521
What up, boss?
You in early.

14:14.556 --> 14:16.094
And you're late.

14:16.129 --> 14:17.689
I'm not sure
if you noticed me over

14:17.724 --> 14:18.899
in the lobby, sir,
but I was here before you.

14:20.496 --> 14:22.364
What time do we open?

14:22.399 --> 14:23.794
At- 00.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.136
What time is it now?

14:26.766 --> 14:27.941
- 50.

14:27.976 --> 14:29.206
Who do you work for?

14:29.241 --> 14:30.867
For you, sir.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.077
But I'm not really
understanding these questions.

14:32.112 --> 14:33.243
You work for me?

14:33.278 --> 14:35.707
Is my office in the lobby?

14:37.414 --> 14:40.954
If you're not at your desk
at- 45, you're late.

14:40.989 --> 14:42.384
How are you assisting me

14:42.419 --> 14:43.418
when there's no assistant
for my client

14:43.453 --> 14:44.617
when they come in, Kevin?

14:47.754 --> 14:49.259
I need you to be
more professional here.

14:51.131 --> 14:54.297
You represent me,
so I need you to represent.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.267
Talk to the ladies
on your break.

14:57.302 --> 14:58.631
Matter of fact, give them
a chance to come to you.

15:00.701 --> 15:02.569
But, Joe, did you see shorty?

15:02.604 --> 15:04.109
She was bad as hell.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.440
You can't wait
on a piece of ass like that.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.178
You feel me?
You've seen it.

15:12.383 --> 15:14.680
<i>There's</i>
<i>no re-living moments.</i>

15:14.715 --> 15:18.552
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>it never turns out well.</i>

15:31.336 --> 15:32.467
- There he is.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.305
Another great night, huh?

15:36.539 --> 15:39.210
I take it you had
another bad one.

15:39.245 --> 15:40.541
Don't want to talk about it.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.941
I just-I don't understand.

15:44.976 --> 15:47.779
You're very handsome
and intelligent, man.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.022
You would think
after all this time,

15:49.057 --> 15:50.188
she'd recognize it.

15:50.223 --> 15:51.420
Yeah, you would think.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.193
Just give it
another 10 years or so.

15:55.228 --> 15:57.195
I don't have 10 years!

15:59.430 --> 16:00.660
I'm just joking, man.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.333
I have an idea.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.567
I'm not cheating on my wife.

16:06.602 --> 16:08.866
I'm not suggesting you
cheat on your wife.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.440
What?

16:14.577 --> 16:18.315
What I was going
to suggest is, for today,

16:18.350 --> 16:21.153
we switch assistants,

16:21.188 --> 16:22.781
help make your day
a little easier.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.196
Malcolm, we've known
each other a long time.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.363
16 strong years.

16:33.398 --> 16:35.167
Yeah.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.894
And you don't think
I wouldn't recognize

16:36.929 --> 16:38.170
when you're trying
to manipulate me?

16:39.932 --> 16:41.404
Kevin is horrible.

16:41.439 --> 16:42.702
-Kevin is not that bad.
-You know what?

16:44.035 --> 16:45.573
You can have Melissa
for the day.

16:45.608 --> 16:47.113
Thank you.

16:47.148 --> 16:49.280
But we get to switch offices
for the week.

16:49.315 --> 16:50.776
-How does that even-
-I didn't think so.

16:52.549 --> 16:54.186
Why do you get
the best office anyway?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.517
We're supposed to be partners.

16:55.552 --> 16:56.617
We are-

16:57.752 --> 16:59.620
We are partners.

16:59.655 --> 17:01.325
I pay more rent than you do.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.795
<i>I remember</i>
<i>when Calvin first got married.</i>

17:11.997 --> 17:15.438
<i>They were happy for a moment.</i>

17:19.576 --> 17:24.150
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>love doesn't exist,</i>

17:25.681 --> 17:27.285
<i>only lustful moments.</i>

17:28.783 --> 17:30.453
<i>When we have a moment</i>
<i>with someone,</i>

17:32.160 --> 17:34.985
<i>we try to extend this moment</i>
<i>to last longer than intended.</i>

17:38.298 --> 17:40.023
<i>That's how relationships happen.</i>

17:43.028 --> 17:47.107
<i>And you end up here...</i>
<i>seeking counsel.</i>

17:54.776 --> 17:56.347
- Sir, uh,
your 9 o'clock is here.

17:56.382 --> 17:57.480
Send her in.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.683
Hello, Mr. King.

18:02.718 --> 18:05.620
Elizabeth, I told you,
call me Malcolm.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.358
And I told you to call me Liz.

18:10.154 --> 18:11.527
How you doing?

18:11.562 --> 18:13.529
I'm actually doing good.

18:13.564 --> 18:15.663
Things are good, thanks to you.

18:15.698 --> 18:17.830
-Nice.
-Yeah.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.172
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.135
So I finally convinced
my husband to come in.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.137
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:28.172 --> 18:29.347
Wow.
How did you do that?

18:29.382 --> 18:30.975
It wasn't easy.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.680
I bet.

18:32.715 --> 18:34.044
So then he'll be joining us
in your next session?

18:34.079 --> 18:36.189
No, he's actually here now.

18:36.224 --> 18:37.190
Listen, I understand.

18:37.225 --> 18:38.521
I got to go.

18:38.556 --> 18:40.655
Uh-Hey, sorry.
Work.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.657
<i>Work, huh?</i>
<i>That's original.</i>

18:42.692 --> 18:44.230
I had to take it.

18:44.265 --> 18:48.564
Um, Mr. King-Malcolm,
this is my husband, Zach.

18:48.599 --> 18:51.061
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

18:55.672 --> 18:57.210
I'm sure I'd remember.

18:57.245 --> 18:58.409
Of course.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.809
Nice to finally meet you,
Zach, I've heard so much.

19:02.844 --> 19:04.514
I hope not all bad.

19:04.549 --> 19:05.713
<i>Of course it is.</i>

19:05.748 --> 19:07.143
Please, take a seat.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.254
Thank you.

19:12.458 --> 19:15.690
So, Zach, I want you
to tell me

19:15.725 --> 19:17.527
what finally made you
decide to come in?

19:18.860 --> 19:20.332
Well, you just get
right to it, huh?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.564
Well, you are paying
by the hour, so...

19:22.897 --> 19:24.028
Honestly...

19:26.736 --> 19:28.131
I love my wife, Malcolm-

19:29.233 --> 19:30.375
Mr. King.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.941
Mr. King,

19:35.976 --> 19:38.009
I want things to work.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.780
I know my wife feels
very strongly about me

19:39.815 --> 19:41.254
coming in to see you.

19:41.289 --> 19:43.883
And here I am, so...

19:45.293 --> 19:47.293
I understand there's
ups and downs in relationships,

19:47.328 --> 19:49.185
we have them,
everyone has them,

19:49.220 --> 19:50.560
you know, but that's
the whole reason

19:50.595 --> 19:51.462
we got married
in the first place.

19:51.497 --> 19:53.024
We love each other.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.795
You know, I think
there's just about anything-

19:54.830 --> 19:57.897
<i>This is what bothers</i>
<i>me the most about my job.</i>

19:57.932 --> 20:03.408
<i>There's so much hope</i>
<i>in her eyes, the pain she's in.</i>

20:03.443 --> 20:04.772
<i>Just hang in there, Liz.</i>

20:15.587 --> 20:17.950
Melissa.

20:17.985 --> 20:20.260
Is any of these clients
here for us?

20:21.494 --> 20:22.988
If you actually did your job,

20:23.023 --> 20:24.759
you wouldn't have
to ask me that.

20:26.290 --> 20:29.060
Well, the thing is, though,

20:29.095 --> 20:31.370
everybody here looks old
and miserable, I guess not.

20:37.268 --> 20:39.103
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.975
What are you staring at?

20:43.010 --> 20:44.284
Staring at you, beautiful.

20:46.046 --> 20:47.287
Well, stop.

20:48.488 --> 20:50.620
Stop?

20:50.655 --> 20:52.325
I think it's time
we stop playing these games

20:52.360 --> 20:54.954
with each other and really say
what's on our minds.

20:57.662 --> 20:59.156
What the fuck
are you talking about?

20:59.191 --> 21:00.300
- Hmm.

21:01.963 --> 21:03.963
No, no. No!

21:03.998 --> 21:05.096
Let him go.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.570
It's about us.

21:08.332 --> 21:09.474
Oh, my God.

21:11.236 --> 21:13.379
Well, that concludes
our session.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.745
I'll walk you guys out.

21:24.392 --> 21:25.622
Thank you.

21:25.657 --> 21:26.656
Thank you.
I'll see you soon.

21:26.691 --> 21:27.756
I'll see you soon.

21:29.221 --> 21:34.631
Like I said, I'm all in,
Mal-Mr. King.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.997
Thank you for being
there for her, for us.

21:38.032 --> 21:39.636
What happened here?

21:39.671 --> 21:41.407
Oh, um, nothing.

21:41.442 --> 21:42.771
-Work stuff.
-Hmm.

21:45.006 --> 21:46.478
Thank you for coming in, Zach.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.644
Yeah.

21:47.679 --> 21:48.744
See you soon.

21:51.419 --> 21:52.847
<i>Zach thinks he has me</i>
<i>convinced</i>

21:52.882 --> 21:54.178
<i>he cares about his marriage.</i>

21:57.282 --> 21:59.051
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>you convinced me</i>

21:59.086 --> 22:00.723
<i>of is that you truly care</i>
<i>about your mistress.</i>

22:06.027 --> 22:07.400
What is this?

22:25.948 --> 22:27.882
<i>You want to convince</i>
<i>your wife enough</i>

22:27.917 --> 22:29.719
<i>so you can continue</i>
<i>to get away with it.</i>

22:33.120 --> 22:35.428
<i>Too bad your mistress</i>
<i>doesn't feel the same about you.</i>

23:55.741 --> 23:57.037
I've heard about you.

23:59.844 --> 24:01.008
The Messiah.

24:03.507 --> 24:04.682
<i>Who?</i>

24:15.662 --> 24:18.322
So you are the savior of women?

24:18.357 --> 24:19.565
<i>She's not scared.</i>

24:20.931 --> 24:22.997
<i>In fact, she looks</i>
<i>almost happy to see me.</i>

24:24.495 --> 24:26.198
<i>A strange man</i>
<i>in your house with a mask</i>

24:26.233 --> 24:27.672
<i>and you're okay with it?</i>

24:29.005 --> 24:30.070
Nothing to say?

24:31.678 --> 24:33.073
<i>You'll tell me</i>
<i>what I want to know.</i>

24:36.947 --> 24:39.409
No, I think it's beautiful
what you're doing,

24:41.413 --> 24:43.248
showing these women
who they married.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.194
I've been wanting to meet you.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.033
For the longest,

24:59.068 --> 25:00.771
I wasn't even sure
if you existed.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.436
We share a common interest,

25:10.981 --> 25:12.376
as you already know.

25:13.951 --> 25:15.918
<i>She knows</i>
<i>what she's doing,</i>

25:15.953 --> 25:18.184
<i>talking,</i>
<i>but not saying anything.</i>

25:18.219 --> 25:19.218
Sure?

25:19.253 --> 25:20.516
<i>She's smart.</i>

25:20.551 --> 25:21.627
It's good.

25:23.488 --> 25:24.597
Raincheck.

25:26.326 --> 25:28.293
<i>Why is this woman not scared?</i>

25:30.165 --> 25:31.967
So, how did you find me?

25:33.300 --> 25:34.398
- You?

25:37.502 --> 25:40.580
Wait, you're not here for me?

25:44.014 --> 25:45.046
I thought...

25:48.656 --> 25:50.480
Wow.

25:50.515 --> 25:51.954
- I should leave.

25:55.091 --> 25:56.156
Wait.

25:57.830 --> 26:00.325
Is it only married
women you save?

26:03.363 --> 26:04.703
I guess so.

26:28.619 --> 26:30.553
- So,
how much do you know?

26:34.966 --> 26:36.064
What?

26:44.877 --> 26:46.140
You wanna take pictures...

26:50.014 --> 26:51.079
For the wife?

26:56.218 --> 26:57.415
You deserve it.

27:00.387 --> 27:01.518
But what about me?

27:03.830 --> 27:04.928
What do I get?

27:07.262 --> 27:08.701
The heartbroken mistress?

27:14.038 --> 27:17.039
I'll do it for you.

27:19.879 --> 27:21.373
But I want something in return.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.856
It's my sister.

28:49.529 --> 28:50.770
<i>How do you know me?</i>

28:52.532 --> 28:56.336
<i>If you knew my name,</i>
<i>you would have said it.</i>

28:59.704 --> 29:01.671
<i>And why would you think</i>
<i>I was there for you?</i>

29:05.149 --> 29:06.610
<i>It's been over a week,</i>

29:06.645 --> 29:07.886
<i>and I can't get you</i>
<i>out of my mind.</i>

29:11.617 --> 29:15.685
<i>We had a moment,</i>
<i>but that moment has passed.</i>

29:18.899 --> 29:20.129
<i>Move on, Malcolm.</i>

29:25.499 --> 29:29.138
<i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>it's difficult to let go.</i>

29:33.243 --> 29:34.539
<i>So I look at these...</i>

29:39.711 --> 29:41.744
<i>to remind me of what once was.</i>

31:49.874 --> 31:51.016
<i>- You like my hair?</i>

31:51.051 --> 31:52.413
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:54.054 --> 31:55.812
<i>- This is always</i>
<i>the hardest part.</i>

31:55.847 --> 31:57.748
<i>- I appreciate it.</i>

31:57.783 --> 32:00.025
<i>- I had to wait</i>
<i>until she had time to process.</i>

32:02.623 --> 32:04.359
<i>While Zach</i>
<i>was on his business trip</i>

32:04.394 --> 32:06.526
<i>for a few days</i>
<i>it was the perfect time.</i>

32:08.662 --> 32:09.969
<i>I'm sorry, Liz.</i>

32:11.863 --> 32:16.503
<i>Love, the word shouldn't exist.</i>

32:16.538 --> 32:20.408
<i>It should be replaced with pain</i>
<i>because that's how love is.</i>

32:23.809 --> 32:25.017
What's going on, man?

32:27.318 --> 32:28.911
Just don't know
how much longer I can take this.

32:30.684 --> 32:33.751
You know, you say that a lot,
but yet you still do.

32:35.018 --> 32:36.853
I want my family.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.657
After 10 years, marriage,

32:38.692 --> 32:41.462
raising kids
and family vacations, it's...

32:43.664 --> 32:45.301
It's not like
you understand, right?

32:45.336 --> 32:47.006
What do you mean, man?
I get it.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.833
Sorry. I just...

32:49.868 --> 32:51.307
It's cool.

32:51.342 --> 32:52.440
I just...

32:54.114 --> 32:56.114
wish my wife wanted me,
you know?

32:57.678 --> 32:59.381
Everything I do
is a failed attempt.

33:06.016 --> 33:07.488
What happened?

33:12.462 --> 33:13.560
- Hmm.

33:14.794 --> 33:16.563
So tired.

33:18.897 --> 33:19.896
Goodnight, honey.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.337
Goodnight?

33:21.372 --> 33:22.602
I'm tired.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.773
Mm-mmm.

33:28.808 --> 33:30.511
Hey.

33:33.153 --> 33:34.284
Oh.

33:37.949 --> 33:42.292
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

33:42.327 --> 33:43.689
I'm scared.

33:43.724 --> 33:46.956
Oh, honey,
did you have a bad dream?

33:46.991 --> 33:48.727
You need to sleep
with mommy and daddy?

33:48.762 --> 33:50.729
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, come here.

33:50.764 --> 33:52.401
Come here.

33:52.436 --> 33:53.666
Oh, let's put you up.

33:55.065 --> 33:56.702
-Oh!
-All right.

33:56.737 --> 33:58.539
You want covers?

33:58.574 --> 34:00.607
Oh, that's my girl.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.114
Mmm, is that better?

34:02.149 --> 34:03.247
She just went to bed
10 minutes ago.

34:03.282 --> 34:04.479
Shh!

35:18.885 --> 35:20.049
Oh, my God!

35:20.084 --> 35:21.226
Oh!

35:24.759 --> 35:26.154
Why didn't you lock the door?

35:26.189 --> 35:27.529
There's no lock on it.

35:27.564 --> 35:29.201
So you don't do it then?

35:29.236 --> 35:30.730
You don't understand,
it's been like six months.

35:30.765 --> 35:32.303
-Six months, man.
-Yeah.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.865
That's crazy.

35:35.737 --> 35:37.132
-Good morning.
-How'd you sleep?

35:37.167 --> 35:38.375
Really well.

35:38.410 --> 35:39.706
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.005
Wow.
Man, that's-

35:42.040 --> 35:43.248
Is that for me?

35:43.283 --> 35:44.414
Oh, yeah, you can take this.

35:44.449 --> 35:45.547
Thank you.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.046
I'll, uh,
I'll be in there in a minute.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.223
You better.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.228
Wow.

35:56.263 --> 35:57.361
Six months, huh?

35:58.925 --> 36:00.188
Yeah, that's crazy, man.

36:00.223 --> 36:01.497
I'm sorry about that.

36:01.532 --> 36:03.532
Yeah.

36:03.567 --> 36:04.797
Well, you'll see.

36:06.273 --> 36:07.635
See how it is,
when you get married.

36:09.441 --> 36:10.935
That's the thing.
I'm not-

36:10.970 --> 36:12.376
You're not getting married.
Yeah, I know.

36:12.411 --> 36:13.542
Don't.

36:17.548 --> 36:19.845
Out of all the women
you've been with,

36:19.880 --> 36:21.110
not one you actually care about?

36:22.982 --> 36:24.047
What you mean, man?

36:24.082 --> 36:25.587
I care about all of them.

36:25.622 --> 36:26.819
You know what I mean.

36:28.427 --> 36:31.494
There's actually one woman
I met recently.

36:34.257 --> 36:35.399
She's pretty interesting.

36:38.096 --> 36:40.635
Interesting, you mean,
interesting enough to see again?

36:40.670 --> 36:42.538
Exactly.

36:42.573 --> 36:43.737
Okay.

36:43.772 --> 36:45.101
So why don't you?

36:45.136 --> 36:47.543
Was it just a one-night stand?

36:47.578 --> 36:48.643
Come on, man.

36:49.910 --> 36:50.975
You know me.

36:52.616 --> 36:54.715
You know you could
try being normal for once,

36:54.750 --> 36:57.586
like, maybe even learn
the name first.

36:57.621 --> 36:59.588
You know, it's not that weird.

36:59.623 --> 37:01.249
Do me a favor, man.
I'm about to take off.

37:01.284 --> 37:03.526
Can you, uh, lock up for me

37:04.991 --> 37:07.156
and then make sure
she's gone before you leave?

37:07.191 --> 37:08.432
-Appreciate you.
-What?

37:08.467 --> 37:10.258
Thanks, man.

37:10.293 --> 37:11.765
In one ear and out the other.

37:15.474 --> 37:16.902
Who am I giving advice?

37:16.937 --> 37:18.035
I can't even get laid
by my own wife.

37:25.715 --> 37:26.846
Oh, shit.

37:26.881 --> 37:28.210
All right, lady, time to go.

37:31.952 --> 37:34.216
<i>I keep coming here</i>
<i>thinking I may run into you.</i>

37:35.989 --> 37:38.924
<i>If I did, what would I even say?</i>

37:38.959 --> 37:40.189
<i>"Remember that night</i>
<i>you found out</i>

37:40.224 --> 37:41.861
<i>"your boyfriend was married?</i>

37:41.896 --> 37:43.368
<i>"I'm the guy you kissed.</i>

37:43.403 --> 37:44.600
<i>"Yeah, you know</i>
<i>the one with the mask."</i>

37:44.635 --> 37:46.404
<i>What is wrong with you, Malcolm?</i>

37:47.704 --> 37:49.770
<i>Why are you even here?</i>

37:49.805 --> 37:51.508
<i>The moment is gone, accept it.</i>

37:57.483 --> 37:58.548
<i>Could this be?</i>

37:59.683 --> 38:00.880
<i>No.</i>

38:02.147 --> 38:04.213
<i>Is that her?</i>

38:04.248 --> 38:05.654
<i>I think...</i>

38:05.689 --> 38:06.886
<i>think it is.</i>

38:27.073 --> 38:28.336
Excuse me, miss.

38:28.371 --> 38:30.041
You need a hand?

38:30.076 --> 38:31.306
-Oh...
<i>-It's not her.</i>

38:31.341 --> 38:32.879
No, thank you.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.684
My husband should be
right down, but thanks.

38:35.719 --> 38:37.389
<i>- Husband?</i>

38:37.424 --> 38:38.984
<i>Do I really come across</i>
<i>like a serial killer?</i>

38:39.019 --> 38:40.249
Are you sure?
I really don't mind.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.822
No, really, I'm okay.

38:41.857 --> 38:42.856
Thank you.

38:42.891 --> 38:44.429
Okay, okay.

38:44.464 --> 38:47.663
<i>Maybe I'll just</i>
<i>knock on the door.</i>

38:47.698 --> 38:49.093
Oh, shit.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.569
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

38:52.604 --> 38:54.263
You must be Tyler.

38:54.298 --> 38:56.705
And this is your Airbnb.

38:56.740 --> 38:57.838
Please forgive me.

38:57.873 --> 38:59.169
I thought that you were just-

38:59.204 --> 39:00.544
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

39:00.579 --> 39:01.611
I just wanted to come by
and make sure

39:01.646 --> 39:03.107
you had everything you need.

39:03.142 --> 39:04.174
-That's all.
-Oh, I really appreciate it.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.340
Everything looks lovely.

39:05.375 --> 39:06.946
-Okay.
-Thank you.

39:06.981 --> 39:07.947
-Well, you enjoy your stay.
-Have a great day.

39:07.982 --> 39:09.751
-No problem.
-Thanks.

39:09.786 --> 39:10.851
-Don't forget your-
-Uh.

39:10.886 --> 39:11.951
There you go.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.723
<i>Looks like you got away from me.</i>

39:15.924 --> 39:18.254
<i>Probably for the best.</i>

39:18.289 --> 39:23.600
<i>Maybe I'll see you again,</i>
<i>but maybe I'm not supposed to.</i>

39:23.635 --> 39:26.933
<i>Besides, I have work to do.</i>

40:04.269 --> 40:08.007
<i>Is it wrong or is it right</i>
<i>for the right reasons?</i>

40:11.375 --> 40:14.046
<i>Either way, I could be wrong</i>
<i>for doing the right thing.</i>

40:16.556 --> 40:17.720
- Yeah.

40:46.476 --> 40:47.882
Oh, no!

40:54.088 --> 40:55.384
No!
Please don't!

40:55.419 --> 40:57.529
Please.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.880
- Hi.

41:51.915 --> 41:54.014
Liz, hey.

41:54.049 --> 41:55.114
You okay?

41:56.381 --> 41:58.689
Zach's having an affair.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.625
<i>And now you're here.</i>

42:00.660 --> 42:02.187
Liz, I'm sorry to hear that.

42:02.222 --> 42:03.958
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.

42:05.093 --> 42:06.763
It's okay.
I totally-

42:11.165 --> 42:13.396
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about this.

42:35.321 --> 42:36.694
<i>This isn't what it looks like.</i>

42:39.358 --> 42:41.094
<i>I'm lying.</i>

42:41.129 --> 42:42.865
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what it looks like.</i>

42:44.495 --> 42:47.100
<i>This is my safe zone,</i>

42:47.135 --> 42:49.608
<i>because this leads</i>
<i>to absolutely nothing.</i>

42:51.304 --> 42:54.778
<i>Just a one-time thing</i>
<i>to ease a broken heart.</i>

42:56.815 --> 42:58.507
<i>I have a thing</i>
<i>for women in pain.</i>

42:59.818 --> 43:02.687
<i>And apparently,</i>
<i>they have a thing for me.</i>

43:04.856 --> 43:07.186
<i>It's obvious why.</i>

43:07.221 --> 43:09.122
<i>I make them feel safe.</i>

43:10.653 --> 43:13.632
<i>They tell me their darkest,</i>
<i>most intimate secrets</i>

43:15.130 --> 43:17.636
<i>because I listen, I'm trusted.</i>

43:20.168 --> 43:23.532
<i>Now they know,</i>
<i>they are living lives</i>

43:23.567 --> 43:24.973
<i>with their cheating spouses.</i>

43:38.516 --> 43:41.825
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>before you react</i>

43:41.860 --> 43:46.225
<i>and do the first thing</i>
<i>that comes to mind, think,</i>

43:46.260 --> 43:48.359
<i>what is the best way</i>
<i>in getting revenge?</i>

43:49.769 --> 43:52.033
<i>What will hurt him the most?</i>

43:52.068 --> 43:54.431
<i>This is what you do.</i>

43:56.204 --> 43:57.676
<i>I'm sorry for your pain.</i>

43:59.372 --> 44:02.076
<i>These files were only</i>
<i>for your eyes</i>

44:02.111 --> 44:06.982
<i>and will be deleted</i>
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

44:11.923 --> 44:13.186
I really messed up.

44:16.026 --> 44:17.762
I wish she'd give me
a second chance.

44:21.592 --> 44:25.198
Every day it hurts

44:25.233 --> 44:28.399
more and more,

44:29.633 --> 44:32.909
and you'd think that in time,

44:32.944 --> 44:36.748
the pain would heal,
but not this pain.

44:38.147 --> 44:40.477
She was the love of my life,
and now she's gone.

44:41.788 --> 44:42.952
She left me.

44:45.121 --> 44:46.318
I would have changed for her.

44:48.421 --> 44:49.728
Whatever she needed.

44:52.425 --> 44:53.622
If she'd just
come back to me,

44:53.657 --> 44:56.394
I could tell her, show her.

45:09.079 --> 45:12.245
It would have been
31 years today.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.478
Today.

45:14.513 --> 45:17.283
And I'm trying, man.

45:17.318 --> 45:20.583
It's just so, so hard,

45:22.455 --> 45:24.257
and I haven't even been
talking to our daughter

45:24.292 --> 45:25.654
since she left us and...

45:27.427 --> 45:30.769
They don't need me, we need her.

45:34.302 --> 45:36.533
There's just nothing left
for me here anymore.

45:51.682 --> 45:56.058
Harold,
Bethany didn't leave you.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.160
She passed away.

46:00.559 --> 46:01.998
Almost four years ago.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.364
She's not coming back.

46:06.697 --> 46:10.006
You don't think...
I know she's dead.

46:15.046 --> 46:16.639
If she could speak to you,

46:16.674 --> 46:18.014
I'm sure she would tell you
to find happiness.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.676
Yeah, she would.

46:24.319 --> 46:26.187
That's why I'm here.

46:26.222 --> 46:27.386
I'm trying.

46:29.588 --> 46:30.829
You're doing great.

46:33.691 --> 46:36.725
<i>- First sessions</i>
<i>are always the worst.</i>

46:36.760 --> 46:39.134
<i>It usually starts</i>
<i>as a competition about</i>

46:39.169 --> 46:41.202
<i>who's right and who's wrong,</i>

46:41.237 --> 46:44.667
<i>or like in this case,</i>
<i>we sit here in complete silence.</i>

46:44.702 --> 46:47.010
Why don't we begin with
what brought you two in today?

46:55.922 --> 46:56.921
He's cheating on me.

46:56.956 --> 46:58.186
No, I'm not.

46:58.221 --> 46:59.891
Yes, you are.
Just admit it.

46:59.926 --> 47:01.321
Why would I cheat on you?

47:01.356 --> 47:02.993
You tell me,
you're the one doing it.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.192
I love you.

47:04.227 --> 47:05.721
Don't touch me.

47:08.759 --> 47:11.826
Hilda, why are you saying
Johnathon is cheating on you?

47:11.861 --> 47:13.465
Because he is.

47:14.765 --> 47:15.830
I understand.

47:15.865 --> 47:18.404
I can just feel it.

47:18.439 --> 47:19.768
It's like a woman's intuition.

47:20.980 --> 47:23.178
Are there any other reasons?

47:23.213 --> 47:24.410
Because...

47:25.985 --> 47:27.512
we're not having sex,

47:27.547 --> 47:29.613
so I know
he's getting it from somewhere.

47:29.648 --> 47:31.549
Every time
I try to make a move,

47:31.584 --> 47:33.716
you turn me down.

47:33.751 --> 47:35.619
-You don't try.
-Well, not anymore.

47:35.654 --> 47:37.225
Why would I continue to try

47:37.260 --> 47:38.754
when all I get are your excuses?

47:38.789 --> 47:39.931
I don't give you excuses.

47:39.966 --> 47:41.460
I'm sorry.

47:41.495 --> 47:42.857
-Your reasons.
-Oh, my God.

47:42.892 --> 47:44.562
And more headaches

47:44.597 --> 47:46.762
and the longest period
of any woman I've ever met.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.269
Oh, don't look like that.
Come on.

47:48.304 --> 47:49.402
This is why we're here,
right, to talk.

47:49.437 --> 47:50.601
So I'm talking.

47:50.636 --> 47:52.339
So what?
You think I'm lying?

47:55.080 --> 47:56.145
Malcolm, is it?

47:56.180 --> 47:57.575
Wow.

47:57.610 --> 47:58.807
You're a doctor.

47:58.842 --> 48:00.215
Tell me, is it, um,

48:00.250 --> 48:02.316
is it possible
for a healthy woman

48:02.351 --> 48:03.647
to have periods that last
an entire month

48:03.682 --> 48:05.319
with maybe one day off?

48:05.354 --> 48:07.222
Ha! Exactly. It's bullshit.

48:07.257 --> 48:08.487
What's bullshit?

48:08.522 --> 48:09.994
You're the one that's lying,

48:10.029 --> 48:11.094
and you're not even man
enough to admit

48:11.129 --> 48:12.095
that you're cheating on me.

48:12.130 --> 48:13.459
And I already know.

48:13.494 --> 48:16.462
I love you too
damn much to cheat.

48:16.497 --> 48:18.629
We'll see,
when I get my envelope

48:18.664 --> 48:20.070
with all of your dirty
little secrets.

48:20.105 --> 48:21.236
<i>- What?</i>

48:21.271 --> 48:23.106
Oh.
Oh, well, you know what?

48:23.141 --> 48:24.569
He only goes after men
who are actually cheating,

48:24.604 --> 48:25.669
so you won't be getting
anything

48:25.704 --> 48:27.440
because I'm not cheating.

48:27.475 --> 48:28.936
<i>-- Wait a minute.</i>
-Well, we'll see about that.

48:28.971 --> 48:31.510
I'm sorry about that,
um, but who is he?

48:31.545 --> 48:33.578
She's talking about some guy

48:33.613 --> 48:35.316
who supposedly leaves
an envelope

48:35.351 --> 48:37.945
on the doorsteps of wives
who are being cheated on.

48:37.980 --> 48:39.320
<i>Damn.</i>

48:39.355 --> 48:40.618
Is this true?

48:40.653 --> 48:42.686
No, it's not.

48:42.721 --> 48:45.128
But she does constantly
use this against me.

48:45.163 --> 48:47.295
So why would these women
make all of this up?

48:47.330 --> 48:49.528
They all have no proof.

48:49.563 --> 48:51.860
Just an envelope
with an empty flash drive.

48:51.895 --> 48:53.466
You want an empty flash drive?

48:53.501 --> 48:54.830
-I'll go down-
-That doesn't even make sense.

48:54.865 --> 48:55.930
<i>- Okay,</i>
<i>so it's not just</i>

48:55.965 --> 48:58.471
<i>a friend of theirs that talked.</i>

48:58.506 --> 49:00.011
<i>There must be a source.</i>

49:00.046 --> 49:01.606
<i>I need to get rid of it.</i>

49:01.641 --> 49:02.970
<i>This can come back-</i>

49:03.005 --> 49:03.872
- Malcolm,
what do you think?

49:06.250 --> 49:08.547
Where does your source
come from?

49:08.582 --> 49:10.021
I told you, I just know.

49:10.056 --> 49:11.484
No, no, no, I'm sorry,

49:11.519 --> 49:13.156
not your source
on Johnathon cheating,

49:13.191 --> 49:16.489
but your source on this man
with the envelopes.

49:16.524 --> 49:17.589
Why?

49:21.430 --> 49:22.891
Well, I believe that
your source,

49:22.926 --> 49:25.729
all of these women,
as you put it,

49:25.764 --> 49:28.501
may have you frightened
that you're next.

49:29.735 --> 49:31.570
And if you get together
with these women

49:31.605 --> 49:33.836
on a regular to talk
about these things,

49:33.871 --> 49:35.475
they can make you feel somewhat-

49:35.510 --> 49:38.214
I don't know
any of these women personally.

49:39.448 --> 49:41.976
In fact, I don't even know
any of their names.

49:42.011 --> 49:45.023
I follow this blog,
Temporary Forevers.

49:52.230 --> 49:54.230
<i>Okay.</i>

49:54.265 --> 49:56.958
<i>Temporary Forevers.</i>

49:58.764 --> 49:59.862
<i>Let's see.</i>

50:03.868 --> 50:05.934

<i>-- Mmm.</i>

50:05.969 --> 50:07.177
<i>Messiah.</i>

50:07.212 --> 50:09.509
<i>- The Messiah.</i>

50:09.544 --> 50:11.115
- Okay.

50:11.150 --> 50:12.875
<i>- I caught</i>
<i>my husband cheating.</i>

50:12.910 --> 50:14.547
<i>Well, I didn't.</i>

50:14.582 --> 50:16.681
<i>Someone left</i>
<i>an envelope on my doorstep.</i>

50:16.716 --> 50:18.045
<i>- I thought</i>
<i>I was the only one.</i>

50:18.080 --> 50:19.189
<i>- Me too.</i>

50:19.224 --> 50:21.686
<i>I never said anything to anyone.</i>

50:21.721 --> 50:23.721
<i>I thought they would think</i>
<i>I was making it up.</i>

50:23.756 --> 50:27.021
<i>Everything deletes</i>
<i>the moment you watch it.</i>

50:27.056 --> 50:28.231
<i>Happy-</i>

50:28.266 --> 50:30.200
<i>- There you are.</i>

50:30.235 --> 50:32.301
<i>- I got everything</i>
<i>and he got what he deserved-</i>

50:32.336 --> 50:34.930
<i>- So you're the one</i>
<i>making me famous.</i>

50:36.472 --> 50:38.274
<i>Veronica Wilson.</i>

50:38.309 --> 50:40.408
<i>- I just</i>
<i>had a date with the Messiah.</i>

50:40.443 --> 50:41.574
<i>- Oh, my God,</i>
<i>are you serious?</i>

50:41.609 --> 50:42.872
<i>What does he look like?</i>

50:42.907 --> 50:44.379
<i>- I didn't see his face.</i>

50:44.414 --> 50:45.545
<i>- So what did you</i>
<i>have to say</i>

50:45.580 --> 50:46.876
<i>about our little encounter?</i>

50:46.911 --> 50:48.042
<i>You didn't see his face?</i>

50:48.077 --> 50:50.121
<i>- I didn't.</i>

50:50.156 --> 50:51.353
<i>He wears a mask.</i>

50:52.653 --> 50:54.719
<i>I wish I could see him again.</i>

50:54.754 --> 50:56.424
<i>- Hmm.</i>

50:56.459 --> 50:58.195
<i>Maybe it's time we meet again.</i>

51:16.809 --> 51:19.150
I have an appointment
at- 00 with Malcolm.

51:19.185 --> 51:21.416
Okay. Can you just sign it
for me right there, please?

51:21.451 --> 51:22.549
Thank you.

51:26.951 --> 51:28.852
All right, just have a seat,
he'll be with you shortly.

51:28.887 --> 51:29.985
Thank you.

51:38.633 --> 51:40.534
Sir, your 10 o'clock is here.

51:41.669 --> 51:42.800
All right.

51:58.488 --> 52:00.653
Okay. I thought
you weren't coming in today.

52:00.688 --> 52:02.655
I didn't think you cared.

52:02.690 --> 52:03.854
I don't.

52:03.889 --> 52:05.493
Well, I wasn't gonna come in,

52:05.528 --> 52:07.495
but I realized

52:07.530 --> 52:08.892
I didn't want you here
all by yourself.

52:11.732 --> 52:13.600
That's sweet, Kevin.

52:15.406 --> 52:17.571
Not sweeter than lips,
I'm guessing.

52:17.606 --> 52:18.869
Mm-hmm.

52:21.709 --> 52:23.544
Look in the desk.

52:23.579 --> 52:25.348
Why?

52:25.383 --> 52:26.877
Just look in the desk.

52:28.914 --> 52:30.188
Voila.
You like?

52:31.785 --> 52:34.016
Okay, that was pretty good.

52:34.051 --> 52:37.261
Tonight, I want you to wear
nothing but that rose.

52:40.398 --> 52:41.859
You just have to ruin it.

52:47.064 --> 52:49.702
Oh, I see somebody loves you.

52:49.737 --> 52:52.001
I used to get
my Becky flowers all the time.

52:52.036 --> 52:53.574
Thank you, Mr. Moore.

52:53.609 --> 52:55.004
-Calvin will be right with you.
-All right.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.775
Tell him to hurry, would you?
Yeah.

52:56.810 --> 52:58.711
No, I'm just kidding.
I got no place to be.

53:18.062 --> 53:19.798
Looking at that man like you
just want to eat him.

53:23.738 --> 53:26.871
Kevin, you ever realize that,
like,

53:26.906 --> 53:29.577
a woman comes in here
sad and then leaves,

53:29.612 --> 53:32.074
I don't know, not so sad?

53:33.616 --> 53:34.747
All the time.

53:34.782 --> 53:36.078
Man's good at his show.

53:36.113 --> 53:38.652
Look, you ever noticed
every time

53:38.687 --> 53:40.115
I come to work
how happy you are?

53:42.922 --> 53:44.823
That doesn't make sense.

53:44.858 --> 53:46.990
It makes perfect sense.

53:47.025 --> 53:49.091
I'm good at my job.

53:49.126 --> 53:50.334
Oh, my God.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.173
<i>Still nothing.</i>

54:05.208 --> 54:06.647
<i>Why haven't you written back?</i>

54:25.668 --> 54:26.865
Hey.

54:28.297 --> 54:29.373
It's me.

54:29.408 --> 54:30.704
I see.

54:32.972 --> 54:34.642
What's going on?

54:34.677 --> 54:35.874
Came to see you.

54:38.241 --> 54:39.482
So you changed
some things around

54:39.517 --> 54:40.813
since the last time I was here.

54:43.488 --> 54:44.817
Yeah.

54:44.852 --> 54:46.324
Uh, that was almost a year ago.

54:48.251 --> 54:49.558
Has it been that long?

54:51.496 --> 54:52.561
Mm-hmm.

54:54.356 --> 54:56.367
I miss this view.

54:56.402 --> 54:58.061
Yeah, it's, uh, something.

55:00.736 --> 55:02.373
So what...

55:02.408 --> 55:04.067
what brings you by?

55:04.102 --> 55:05.442
Funny you should ask.

55:07.545 --> 55:11.173
Um, I was just at home
thinking about that one time.

55:12.682 --> 55:14.517
Yeah.

55:14.552 --> 55:15.980
Um, do you remember
that conversation

55:16.015 --> 55:18.015
we had the last time
you was here?

55:20.052 --> 55:21.392
It was so long ago.

55:22.725 --> 55:25.253
We agreed that because
we work together,

55:25.288 --> 55:27.761
this is probably
not the best idea.

55:29.259 --> 55:33.261
I think one time a year is fine.

55:40.710 --> 55:42.171
<i>She is tempting,</i>

55:42.206 --> 55:43.645
<i>but I'm not going to do</i>
<i>that again.</i>

55:46.408 --> 55:49.948
<i>Um, Melissa, I'm...</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I really...</i>

55:49.983 --> 55:52.082
<i>I have some serious work</i>
<i>I got to get to, I'm...</i>

55:52.117 --> 55:54.887
<i>I'm sorry about this, okay?</i>

55:54.922 --> 55:56.625
Unbelievable.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.221
We work together.

55:59.256 --> 56:00.794
We work together,

56:00.829 --> 56:02.224
but it's okay for you
to screw your clients.

56:02.259 --> 56:04.028
- Wait, what?

56:04.063 --> 56:05.469
Look, you don't want to waste
your time worried about

56:05.504 --> 56:07.229
somebody like me, okay?

56:09.134 --> 56:10.639
You're young and beautiful.

56:12.104 --> 56:14.577
And besides, Kevin,
you know, he cares about you.

56:16.009 --> 56:17.514
And I care about you.

56:20.244 --> 56:22.453
Look, I'm not here just for sex.

56:24.314 --> 56:25.621
I just thought
that was the only way

56:25.656 --> 56:26.853
to get your attention.

56:30.529 --> 56:33.189
I'd love to go out
with you on a real date.

56:37.459 --> 56:41.670
But I see you and I know
that's not what you want.

56:43.707 --> 56:45.542
Not just with me,
but with anybody.

56:48.107 --> 56:49.370
Well, you can get back to work.

56:51.044 --> 56:52.340
I'm sorry I came by.

56:56.346 --> 56:59.116
<i>Okay for me</i>
<i>to screw my clients?</i>

56:59.151 --> 57:00.854
<i>She doesn't have proof.</i>

57:00.889 --> 57:02.284
<i>Why would she say that?</i>

57:05.025 --> 57:06.728
<i>Let's see what you had to say.</i>

57:08.160 --> 57:09.665
<i>"When and where?"</i>

57:11.702 --> 57:12.965

I wanted to know more

1:01:38.727 --> 1:01:40.133
And that's why
you wanted to meet.

1:01:42.632 --> 1:01:43.774
This is an interview?

1:01:45.074 --> 1:01:47.701
Good, because I have
some questions

1:01:47.736 --> 1:01:49.241
I'm sure the ladies
on my blog

1:01:49.276 --> 1:01:50.605
would love to know about, too.

1:01:55.315 --> 1:01:57.711
And this is just for me.

1:01:57.746 --> 1:01:59.020
I don't want to forget anything.

1:02:01.783 --> 1:02:03.453
So what about my blog
did you want to know?

1:02:06.029 --> 1:02:08.326
I was hoping
you can take it down.

1:02:08.361 --> 1:02:11.934
Oh, I get it,
you want to stay discreet.

1:02:13.971 --> 1:02:15.168
Exactly.

1:02:15.203 --> 1:02:16.301
No.

1:02:18.206 --> 1:02:19.436
No?

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:26.014
Let me explain something.

1:02:26.049 --> 1:02:29.743
My blog is an outlet
for women to discuss things.

1:02:29.778 --> 1:02:31.822
And you are a big part
of that now.

1:02:35.784 --> 1:02:36.926
I shouldn't have come.

1:02:36.961 --> 1:02:38.059
Wait.

1:02:42.362 --> 1:02:43.625
What would you like to know?

1:02:45.563 --> 1:02:49.301
Interview with the Messiah?

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:52.975
First question.

1:02:55.474 --> 1:02:56.638
Why?

1:02:58.345 --> 1:03:01.643
<i>I can't believe it,</i>
<i>she deleted the Messiah page.</i>

1:03:05.517 --> 1:03:06.989
<i>There you are, Johnathon.</i>

1:03:09.356 --> 1:03:10.586
<i>And who are you?</i>

1:03:14.031 --> 1:03:15.866
<i>Looks like you were right,</i>
<i>Hilda.</i>

1:03:20.939 --> 1:03:22.268
<i>And she's pregnant.</i>

1:03:23.909 --> 1:03:25.403
<i>A woman's intuition.</i>

1:03:27.044 --> 1:03:28.736
<i>Didn't think</i>
<i>that was a real thing.</i>

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:44.092
<i>I can't believe you deleted it.</i>

1:03:45.854 --> 1:03:47.755
<i>There's no reason</i>
<i>to see you again.</i>

1:03:49.363 --> 1:03:52.265
<i>You did what I wanted, but why?</i>

1:03:54.071 --> 1:03:55.796
<i>What was it that made you do it?</i>

1:03:57.976 --> 1:04:00.042
<i>Damn!</i>

1:04:00.077 --> 1:04:01.802
<i>You are so hard to read.</i>

1:04:20.823 --> 1:04:23.758
<i>All right, Johnathon,</i>
<i>where are we?</i>

1:05:01.534 --> 1:05:04.766
<i>This is your sister</i>

1:05:05.934 --> 1:05:07.208
<i>and her husband.</i>

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:12.543
<i>You want what they have,</i>
<i>a family.</i>

1:05:24.689 --> 1:05:26.524
Sorry, I'm late.

1:05:26.559 --> 1:05:28.130
Yeah.
I'm surprised.

1:05:28.165 --> 1:05:29.626
You're never late.

1:05:29.661 --> 1:05:31.430
Things have been
a little upside down lately.

1:05:31.465 --> 1:05:33.267
How so?

1:05:33.302 --> 1:05:34.961
How you been?

1:05:34.996 --> 1:05:37.337
Malcolm, you know that
if you continue to deflect,

1:05:37.372 --> 1:05:38.965
your sessions won't count.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.670
- Can I get you
two anything to drink?

1:05:40.705 --> 1:05:42.441
Hi. Um, can you
just give us a minute?

1:05:42.476 --> 1:05:44.806
-- Yeah, sure.
-Thank you so much.

1:05:44.841 --> 1:05:47.446
All right, so.

1:05:47.481 --> 1:05:49.052
Really?

1:05:49.087 --> 1:05:51.516
Yeah, really.
What's going on?

1:05:51.551 --> 1:05:53.485
You know I don't like
you doing that.

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:56.389
You asked me to help.
That's all I'm trying to do.

1:05:56.424 --> 1:05:58.457
If my license wasn't
on the line,

1:05:58.492 --> 1:06:01.064
we wouldn't be having
these conversations.

1:06:01.099 --> 1:06:02.527
We legally have to talk
about this, so...

1:06:02.562 --> 1:06:04.529
Yeah, exactly.

1:06:04.564 --> 1:06:06.036
So instead of going
to anyone else,

1:06:06.071 --> 1:06:07.334
you decided to come to me.

1:06:07.369 --> 1:06:08.962
Because you're a friend.

1:06:08.997 --> 1:06:10.238
Yeah, but, Malcolm,
that doesn't mean that

1:06:10.273 --> 1:06:11.668
I'm not going to do my job.

1:06:11.703 --> 1:06:12.999
I like these sessions
to feel more like

1:06:13.034 --> 1:06:14.836
conversation, not therapy.

1:06:18.248 --> 1:06:19.676
Are you seeing escorts?

1:06:21.746 --> 1:06:23.548
Wow. Really?

1:06:23.583 --> 1:06:26.551
Doing anything that would be
considered sexually illegal?

1:06:26.586 --> 1:06:28.190
Will you keep your voice down?
We're at a restaurant.

1:06:28.225 --> 1:06:29.884
Because if you are...

1:06:29.919 --> 1:06:31.094
I met somebody.

1:06:32.229 --> 1:06:33.624
Oh, okay.

1:06:35.958 --> 1:06:37.100
Hmm.

1:06:40.798 --> 1:06:42.435
Are you... are you cool.

1:06:42.470 --> 1:06:43.601
You just...

1:06:43.636 --> 1:06:45.273
Oh, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

1:06:45.308 --> 1:06:47.110
You just seem
a little jealous, that's all.

1:06:47.145 --> 1:06:49.002
No, I'm... I'm just-

1:06:49.037 --> 1:06:50.344
I'm not jealous,
I'm just curious.

1:06:50.379 --> 1:06:52.511
So tell me about her.

1:06:52.546 --> 1:06:54.414
We went on a date

1:06:56.044 --> 1:06:57.846
and I haven't heard from her.

1:06:57.881 --> 1:07:00.222
But isn't that what you prefer,
to keep things simple,

1:07:00.257 --> 1:07:02.224
keep your urges in check?

1:07:02.259 --> 1:07:03.918
Yeah, it is.

1:07:05.790 --> 1:07:07.625
I just kind of want to see
her again, you know?

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:08.956
So then why don't you call her?

1:07:10.135 --> 1:07:11.332
I don't have her number.

1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:14.500
Okay, so question, uh,

1:07:15.998 --> 1:07:18.867
what is it about her that makes
you want to see her again?

1:07:18.902 --> 1:07:20.638
I don't know.

1:07:20.673 --> 1:07:22.310
Well, maybe you should
ask yourself why.

1:07:27.515 --> 1:07:29.075
Mmm.

1:07:29.110 --> 1:07:30.912
Hey, boss.

1:07:30.947 --> 1:07:32.650
You gotta try these cupcakes
Melissa made.

1:07:32.685 --> 1:07:35.290
Cupcakes, this early?

1:07:35.325 --> 1:07:38.326
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, you should try one.

1:07:38.361 --> 1:07:39.921
I thought
you was allergic to chocolate.

1:07:39.956 --> 1:07:41.395
Mmm, I am.

1:07:41.430 --> 1:07:42.792
It's just food coloring.

1:07:42.827 --> 1:07:44.893
No, it isn't.

1:07:44.928 --> 1:07:46.169
Stop playing.

1:07:46.204 --> 1:07:47.962
Why would I dye
a vanilla cupcake

1:07:47.997 --> 1:07:49.502
to look like
a chocolate cupcake?

1:08:00.383 --> 1:08:03.109
Um, Melissa, listen,
I'm sorry about-

1:08:03.144 --> 1:08:05.353
I'm so sorry.

1:08:05.388 --> 1:08:06.684
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1:08:08.193 --> 1:08:09.819
I hope I didn't make
you uncomfortable

1:08:09.854 --> 1:08:11.161
or anything like that.

1:08:11.196 --> 1:08:13.020
No, you didn't.

1:08:13.055 --> 1:08:15.627
The last thing I want to do
is ruin our work environment.

1:08:15.662 --> 1:08:16.958
Yeah, me too.

1:08:18.159 --> 1:08:20.203
I apologize, too.

1:08:20.238 --> 1:08:21.699
I should've known better

1:08:21.734 --> 1:08:24.636
when we had
our first little encounter.

1:08:24.671 --> 1:08:26.275
Mm-hmm.

1:08:26.310 --> 1:08:27.705
But I want you to know
I'm a professional.

1:08:27.740 --> 1:08:29.003
I take my job very serious.

1:08:29.038 --> 1:08:30.213
I don't want you to think I'm-

1:08:30.248 --> 1:08:31.379
I know that.

1:08:32.844 --> 1:08:34.217
I was just being jealous.

1:08:36.045 --> 1:08:37.484
I think you're a great guy.

1:08:41.017 --> 1:08:42.324
Um, ignore what I said.

1:08:43.921 --> 1:08:45.492
So we good?

1:08:45.527 --> 1:08:46.526
Guys, I think
I need to go to the hospital.

1:08:46.561 --> 1:08:48.022
-Damn!
-Oh, my God!

1:08:54.162 --> 1:08:56.338
He'll be okay.

1:08:56.373 --> 1:08:57.438
I'll cover for him.

1:08:59.739 --> 1:09:01.541
Uh, are you sure?

1:09:01.576 --> 1:09:02.905
-I don't want to-
-Yeah.

1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:04.643
Okay...
overwhelm you or anything.

1:09:04.678 --> 1:09:06.139
Not a problem...

1:09:06.174 --> 1:09:07.679
Okay.

1:09:07.714 --> 1:09:08.845
..boss.

1:09:23.301 --> 1:09:25.367
<i>Today is going</i>
<i>to be one of those days.</i>

1:09:39.779 --> 1:09:41.383
<i>What have you been up to?</i>

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:46.113
<i>Maybe I should</i>
<i>send another message.</i>

1:09:46.148 --> 1:09:50.392
<i>Just to say thank you,</i>
<i>or maybe I should just ask...</i>

1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:53.494
<i>how are you.</i>

1:09:57.995 --> 1:09:59.764
<i>- Malcolm,</i>
<i>your 9 o'clock is here.</i>

1:10:02.769 --> 1:10:04.164
How does that make you feel?

1:10:05.838 --> 1:10:07.277
Angry.

1:10:07.312 --> 1:10:08.740
You want a clean sponge
and dirty dishes?

1:10:08.775 --> 1:10:10.808
My girl is driving me
fucking nuts.

1:10:10.843 --> 1:10:12.579
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

1:10:12.614 --> 1:10:14.075
I don't know what to do anymore.

1:10:14.110 --> 1:10:16.418
You're at home all day
while I'm working.

1:10:16.453 --> 1:10:17.881
Man, it's not even like

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:20.752
something specific or,
like, her.

1:10:20.787 --> 1:10:24.217
Just...
just every day, bro, with her.

1:10:24.252 --> 1:10:28.562
Without someone being
there to actually

1:10:28.597 --> 1:10:31.598
speak for our people,
then we have no voice.

1:10:31.633 --> 1:10:33.633
We become complacent
like we have now.

1:10:33.668 --> 1:10:36.097
But what about you?

1:10:36.132 --> 1:10:37.637
What about, what about me?

1:10:37.672 --> 1:10:39.232
I'm at home, I'm at the crib.

1:10:39.267 --> 1:10:41.443
You know where
I'm at all the time.

1:10:41.478 --> 1:10:42.840
I need... I need a man.

1:10:42.875 --> 1:10:44.347
Is that, is that what
you're saying?

1:10:44.382 --> 1:10:45.645
I clean up the place,
I put it all back.

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:47.009
She says nothing.

1:10:47.044 --> 1:10:48.780
-I want this to-
-Nothing's happening.

1:10:48.815 --> 1:10:50.485
I'm not going to stop
playing my game.

1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:51.948
I'm not going to stop
loving you.

1:10:51.983 --> 1:10:53.752
I can't take this shit anymore.

1:10:53.787 --> 1:10:56.920
I have this dream of me
getting on top of her, man.

1:10:56.955 --> 1:10:58.427
And it's not enough.

1:10:58.462 --> 1:10:59.791
We deserve more.

1:10:59.826 --> 1:11:01.826
I try to go out of my way
to make sure

1:11:01.861 --> 1:11:03.289
you feel comfortable,

1:11:03.324 --> 1:11:05.093
that you always have
your latest games.

1:11:05.128 --> 1:11:06.666
Are you married?

1:11:06.701 --> 1:11:08.030
Hmm.

1:11:08.065 --> 1:11:09.834
Am I wrong, though?
Like...

1:11:09.869 --> 1:11:11.341
She cheated on me with a guy.

1:11:11.376 --> 1:11:13.343
I need someone
to be there for me.

1:11:13.378 --> 1:11:14.608
Am I overreacting?

1:11:14.643 --> 1:11:15.807
Oh, we'll see.

1:11:15.842 --> 1:11:16.973
All right, bro.

1:11:17.008 --> 1:11:18.139
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:19.382
Appreciate it.

1:11:28.184 --> 1:11:29.359
How are you holding up?

1:11:30.527 --> 1:11:31.889
I'm hanging.

1:11:31.924 --> 1:11:33.220
How's Kevin?

1:11:33.255 --> 1:11:35.695
He's okay.
He's at the doctor, so...

1:11:35.730 --> 1:11:37.730
Okay, good.

1:11:37.765 --> 1:11:39.094
You ready for your
last appointment?

1:11:40.328 --> 1:11:41.503
Yeah, no choice.

1:11:42.704 --> 1:11:44.638
Yeah, let's get it done.

1:11:44.673 --> 1:11:45.837
You got it.

1:11:47.709 --> 1:11:49.005
Oh, Melissa.

1:11:51.581 --> 1:11:52.778
Thank you.

1:12:18.773 --> 1:12:20.201
I'm sorry about this.

1:12:20.236 --> 1:12:21.840
I had an accident.

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:23.237
Oh, no worries.

1:12:26.814 --> 1:12:28.011
<i>Shit.</i>

1:12:28.046 --> 1:12:30.046
Malcolm, is it?

1:12:30.081 --> 1:12:31.487
It is.

1:12:33.381 --> 1:12:34.424
Veronica, right?

1:12:34.459 --> 1:12:36.382
Yes, it is.

1:12:36.417 --> 1:12:38.791
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1:12:38.826 --> 1:12:40.463
Please take a seat.

1:12:42.467 --> 1:12:43.730
<i>Why are you here?</i>

1:12:45.965 --> 1:12:47.228
<i>You figured it out?</i>

1:12:48.396 --> 1:12:49.472
Damn.

1:12:49.507 --> 1:12:51.199
Okay.

1:12:51.234 --> 1:12:52.442
Sorry about that,

1:12:54.237 --> 1:12:56.270
I had a little accident
a minute ago.

1:13:02.113 --> 1:13:05.983
So, what brings you in?

1:13:06.018 --> 1:13:08.414
Oh, you just get right to it?

1:13:08.449 --> 1:13:09.756
-Okay.
-Um...

1:13:09.791 --> 1:13:11.219
I'm sorry about that.

1:13:11.254 --> 1:13:12.319
How's your day?

1:13:12.354 --> 1:13:14.387
<i>I'm completely fucking up.</i>

1:13:14.422 --> 1:13:15.663
Malcolm.

1:13:16.831 --> 1:13:17.962
Yes.

1:13:17.997 --> 1:13:19.425
<i>Why are you messing with me?</i>

1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:21.064
<i>Just come out and say it.</i>

1:13:21.099 --> 1:13:23.363
Is it okay if I ask you
some questions first?

1:13:24.773 --> 1:13:26.135
Of course.

1:13:26.170 --> 1:13:27.675
It's just my first time
doing this,

1:13:27.710 --> 1:13:29.237
and I feel it'll help me...

1:13:29.272 --> 1:13:30.579
Open up.

1:13:30.614 --> 1:13:32.845
I understand.

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:34.583
What would you like to know?

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:36.178
How long have
you been doing this?

1:13:38.446 --> 1:13:40.116
Almost a year.

1:13:40.151 --> 1:13:41.381
Hmm.

1:13:43.385 --> 1:13:45.792
What made you want to do this?

1:13:45.827 --> 1:13:48.861
People hurting people.

1:13:51.866 --> 1:13:54.031
You can give a person
everything and...

1:13:56.233 --> 1:13:58.332
get nothing,
but pain every time.

1:13:58.367 --> 1:14:00.367
You're talking from experience?

1:14:02.008 --> 1:14:05.174
Tell me about your experiences.

1:14:07.046 --> 1:14:09.442
Talking about relationships?

1:14:09.477 --> 1:14:10.982
Talking about...

1:14:12.887 --> 1:14:14.524
whatever the question
means to you.

1:14:16.825 --> 1:14:19.056
We're here to talk
about you, not me.

1:14:21.665 --> 1:14:23.027
Next question.

1:14:25.669 --> 1:14:28.065
What's this?

1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:29.902
The infinity symbol.

1:14:29.937 --> 1:14:33.939
I know,
but there's a piece missing.

1:14:35.437 --> 1:14:36.711
It's broken.

1:14:38.209 --> 1:14:41.782
When a spouse cheats,
they're breaking vows.

1:14:44.622 --> 1:14:46.413
Tell me something about you.

1:14:46.448 --> 1:14:47.920
In time.

1:14:51.189 --> 1:14:52.760
Are you married?

1:14:52.795 --> 1:14:55.598
I am single, actually.

1:14:55.633 --> 1:14:57.259
You?

1:14:57.294 --> 1:15:00.097
But you do couples therapy.

1:15:00.132 --> 1:15:02.264
I do.

1:15:02.299 --> 1:15:03.771
Do I need to be
in a relationship

1:15:03.806 --> 1:15:05.707
to do couples therapy?

1:15:05.742 --> 1:15:06.873
No.

1:15:06.908 --> 1:15:08.006
I'm sorry.

1:15:08.041 --> 1:15:10.679
Yeah, I'm single, at the moment.

1:15:10.714 --> 1:15:11.944
At the moment.

1:15:13.277 --> 1:15:15.541
So that means
there's someone,

1:15:15.576 --> 1:15:17.378
you're just not sure
how serious it is.

1:15:18.755 --> 1:15:20.414
It's complicated.

1:15:20.449 --> 1:15:21.756
It's always complicated.

1:15:23.221 --> 1:15:24.627
But not with you.

1:15:26.455 --> 1:15:27.729
What do you mean?

1:15:27.764 --> 1:15:29.599
I see you embedded this.

1:15:30.899 --> 1:15:32.426
Why?

1:15:32.461 --> 1:15:33.900
Because you gave it to me.

1:15:37.939 --> 1:15:39.235
Tell me.

1:15:40.469 --> 1:15:42.238
Do you ever think about
that night?

1:15:45.683 --> 1:15:48.277
Uh, thank you,
I think that's everything.

1:15:53.317 --> 1:15:54.756
Maybe we can...

1:15:55.957 --> 1:15:58.221
do this again sometime?

1:15:58.256 --> 1:15:59.354
Maybe.

1:16:09.597 --> 1:16:11.432
Does she make
you dinner every night?

1:16:14.811 --> 1:16:16.008
Most nights.

1:16:17.814 --> 1:16:20.342
Does she take care of the kids,
keep the house clean?

1:16:23.820 --> 1:16:25.017
Yeah.

1:16:26.647 --> 1:16:27.789
Do you?

1:16:31.289 --> 1:16:32.662
I mean, I have work.

1:16:34.127 --> 1:16:35.357
Does she work?

1:16:40.298 --> 1:16:41.462
Yeah.

1:16:42.971 --> 1:16:44.905
So she loves you.

1:16:46.337 --> 1:16:47.941
Look, just because
people have been together

1:16:47.976 --> 1:16:49.943
for a long time,
it doesn't mean

1:16:49.978 --> 1:16:52.341
the romance
or affection has died.

1:16:52.376 --> 1:16:54.882
It just changes.

1:16:54.917 --> 1:16:57.720
I mean, what do
you want from her?

1:17:00.351 --> 1:17:01.988
Want her to bring you
flowers every day.

1:17:03.519 --> 1:17:04.991
Do you bring her flowers?

1:17:08.898 --> 1:17:10.799
So, maybe she's feeling

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:12.493
some of what you're feeling
right now.

1:17:14.530 --> 1:17:17.366
And you said you've tried
everything, I mean, have you?

1:17:17.401 --> 1:17:21.843
If you simply just tried
to sit down and talk with her,

1:17:21.878 --> 1:17:25.506
communicate how you feel
and why you feel this way,

1:17:25.541 --> 1:17:28.850
and then ask her how she feels.

1:17:32.790 --> 1:17:34.581
You ever thought about
being a therapist?

1:17:38.686 --> 1:17:39.861
What up, boss?

1:17:39.896 --> 1:17:40.961
You ready
for your 2 o'clock?

1:17:42.525 --> 1:17:46.164
Kevin, has a Veronica Wilson
called in,

1:17:46.199 --> 1:17:47.737
to make her next appointment?

1:17:47.772 --> 1:17:49.530
She still hasn't,
but I'll be sure to let you know

1:17:49.565 --> 1:17:51.598
when she does, I got you.

1:17:51.633 --> 1:17:52.742
Damn.

1:17:52.777 --> 1:17:53.941
Oh, matter of fact, you know

1:17:53.976 --> 1:17:55.404
her number's on the file, right?

1:17:55.439 --> 1:17:56.537
I'm just saying.

1:17:57.705 --> 1:17:59.881
I know.

1:17:59.916 --> 1:18:02.345
But what do I always tell you?

1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:03.918
Not to eat chocolate
at work again.

1:18:03.953 --> 1:18:06.349
If I want to kill myself,
do it on my own time.

1:18:06.384 --> 1:18:07.581
The other thing.

1:18:09.387 --> 1:18:10.727
To be patient.

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:15.655
I'm letting her come to me.

1:18:38.647 --> 1:18:40.152
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

1:18:42.288 --> 1:18:43.991
<i>If I have to be honest,</i>

1:18:44.026 --> 1:18:46.026
<i>I didn't think it would take you</i>
<i>this long to come back.</i>

1:18:49.427 --> 1:18:50.591
Hey.

1:18:50.626 --> 1:18:51.933
Hey, hey.

1:18:51.968 --> 1:18:53.099
I hope you don't mind.

1:18:53.134 --> 1:18:54.661
The door was open and I just...

1:18:54.696 --> 1:18:56.168
Excuse me, miss,
what's your name?

1:18:56.203 --> 1:18:57.598
Veronica.

1:18:57.633 --> 1:18:58.973
Veronica.

1:18:59.008 --> 1:19:01.008
Yes, Veronica Wilson.

1:19:01.043 --> 1:19:02.141
-I had an appointment.
-Yeah.

1:19:02.176 --> 1:19:03.571
You called yesterday,

1:19:03.606 --> 1:19:05.144
but your phone was like
a little static.

1:19:05.179 --> 1:19:05.947
What you got,
a little android or something?

1:19:05.982 --> 1:19:07.740
Thank you, Kevin.

1:19:07.775 --> 1:19:09.148
Okay.

1:19:09.183 --> 1:19:10.347
Um, do y'all need anything?

1:19:10.382 --> 1:19:12.019
-I'm fine.
-You sure?

1:19:12.054 --> 1:19:13.119
I'll be right out here
if you do.

1:19:13.154 --> 1:19:15.187
Kevin, close the door.

1:19:15.222 --> 1:19:16.892
Well, I'm gonna do some
paperwork or something.

1:19:19.490 --> 1:19:20.720
Did you tell him about me?

1:19:22.691 --> 1:19:26.396
Uh, did I...

1:19:29.907 --> 1:19:31.203
Please, take a seat.

1:19:37.981 --> 1:19:39.640
I'm glad you decided
to come back.

1:19:40.885 --> 1:19:42.148
Can I ask you a question?

1:19:42.183 --> 1:19:44.315
More questions?

1:19:44.350 --> 1:19:46.350
I know.

1:19:46.385 --> 1:19:47.516
You know,
you're not paying me

1:19:47.551 --> 1:19:49.452
to learn about me.

1:19:49.487 --> 1:19:50.585
<i>Or are you?</i>

1:19:55.196 --> 1:19:57.724
I was just wondering
if it's at all possible

1:19:57.759 --> 1:19:59.594
to have sessions elsewhere.

1:20:00.696 --> 1:20:02.399
Elsewhere?

1:20:02.434 --> 1:20:03.873
I know that's unprofessional.

1:20:03.908 --> 1:20:06.469
I just think that
a different environment

1:20:06.504 --> 1:20:08.606
might help me
communicate better.

1:20:11.674 --> 1:20:12.739
I understand.

1:20:15.051 --> 1:20:16.215
I know a place.

1:20:19.748 --> 1:20:20.956
Is this better?

1:20:22.421 --> 1:20:23.585
Much better.

1:20:24.786 --> 1:20:28.359
You know, I'm the same way.

1:20:28.394 --> 1:20:30.262
What do you mean?

1:20:30.297 --> 1:20:32.935
How about just this
once we talk about you?

1:20:34.763 --> 1:20:36.367
Well, I appreciate
what you're doing.

1:20:37.535 --> 1:20:38.864
It definitely helps.

1:20:38.899 --> 1:20:40.107
Yeah.

1:20:43.574 --> 1:20:44.771
I have an idea.

1:20:46.412 --> 1:20:49.281
Instead of these being like
typical therapy sessions,

1:20:50.746 --> 1:20:52.053
why don't we be friends?

1:20:53.782 --> 1:20:55.958
What do you mean, friends?

1:20:55.993 --> 1:20:58.026
I mean, instead of us
meeting at my office

1:20:58.061 --> 1:21:00.963
once a week,
we can meet at other places.

1:21:03.099 --> 1:21:04.395
Like dating?

1:21:06.135 --> 1:21:08.003
Uh, no, not like dating.

1:21:09.798 --> 1:21:11.501
Just until you feel comfortable.

1:21:15.639 --> 1:21:17.177
I'll choose the next place.

1:21:40.631 --> 1:21:42.103
Okay, okay, okay.

1:21:42.138 --> 1:21:43.335
Okay.

1:21:43.370 --> 1:21:44.699
You okay?

1:21:46.109 --> 1:21:47.933
I can't believe I agreed to it.

1:21:47.968 --> 1:21:49.638
What were you expecting?

1:21:49.673 --> 1:21:51.409
Dinner and movie?

1:21:51.444 --> 1:21:52.575
Maybe.

1:22:10.133 --> 1:22:11.330
You come here a lot?

1:22:12.861 --> 1:22:15.169
I used to.

1:22:15.204 --> 1:22:17.402
My parents used to bring me
and my sister here all the time.

1:22:19.538 --> 1:22:20.801
Why used to?

1:22:23.872 --> 1:22:26.543
Is it me or does it seem like
every family has that

1:22:26.578 --> 1:22:28.809
one family member that
keeps everyone together,

1:22:30.417 --> 1:22:33.187
the person that keeps
everyone in check?

1:22:35.015 --> 1:22:39.160
No matter what they did,
if the family messes up,

1:22:39.195 --> 1:22:41.756
you forgive family and move on.

1:22:42.924 --> 1:22:44.990
That's it.

1:22:45.025 --> 1:22:46.266
Seems that way.

1:22:48.369 --> 1:22:50.270
Yeah, that's...

1:22:51.999 --> 1:22:53.669
that's what my mom was for us.

1:22:55.442 --> 1:22:59.708
She, uh, she kept us together.

1:22:59.743 --> 1:23:01.512
Me, my dad, and my sister.

1:23:03.043 --> 1:23:04.713
She was always there...

1:23:07.047 --> 1:23:08.288
until she wasn't.

1:23:11.425 --> 1:23:12.754
What happened to her?

1:23:15.561 --> 1:23:19.860
She died, and none of us
were ready for it.

1:23:24.064 --> 1:23:25.371
How did she pass?

1:23:28.310 --> 1:23:29.573
I remember her telling me

1:23:29.608 --> 1:23:31.080
I was gonna have
a baby brother.

1:23:34.613 --> 1:23:36.217
But she died giving birth.

1:23:40.553 --> 1:23:41.915
What about the baby?

1:23:44.755 --> 1:23:46.161
Baby didn't make it, either.

1:23:50.794 --> 1:23:53.300
Things changed.

1:23:53.335 --> 1:23:55.071
You and your family
ever since, huh?

1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:00.604
Yeah, it's been a while,

1:24:02.146 --> 1:24:06.115
but for years I just tried
to stay in front of it,

1:24:06.150 --> 1:24:10.977
not face it, but I miss my mom.

1:24:12.651 --> 1:24:13.980
I miss my family.

1:24:15.753 --> 1:24:20.085
You and your family been
distant with each other

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:21.328
ever since your mom?

1:24:23.299 --> 1:24:28.665
Yeah, I've been distant,
we've all been distant.

1:24:30.207 --> 1:24:31.536
Yeah.

1:24:33.507 --> 1:24:35.144
It happens that way sometimes.

1:24:37.973 --> 1:24:40.842
Even though your mother is
no longer with us, I'm sure...

1:24:42.615 --> 1:24:45.517
she'd want all of you
to still be close,

1:24:47.521 --> 1:24:49.015
still love each other.

1:24:52.361 --> 1:24:54.053
Maybe you can be
that person now.

1:25:24.019 --> 1:25:29.429
<i>People, I can't say</i>
<i>why people fascinate me so much.</i>

1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:33.499
<i>If I had to give a reason,</i>

1:25:33.534 --> 1:25:35.600
<i>it's because</i>
<i>we're so different...</i>

1:25:37.032 --> 1:25:40.176
<i>each and every one of us.</i>

1:25:41.575 --> 1:25:43.069
<i>We constantly change.</i>

1:28:11.318 --> 1:28:12.658

1:28:12.693 --> 1:28:14.220
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

1:28:14.255 --> 1:28:15.727
-Did you miss me?

1:28:15.762 --> 1:28:17.223
-How are you?
-- Hey, Emma.

1:28:17.258 --> 1:28:18.499
-Good to see you.
-Nice to see you.

1:28:18.534 --> 1:28:20.061
Daddy, this is-

1:28:20.096 --> 1:28:21.161
Malcolm.

1:28:21.196 --> 1:28:22.734
Hey.
How you doing?

1:28:22.769 --> 1:28:24.868
I'm good.
Small world.

1:28:24.903 --> 1:28:26.738
Wait, how do you two know
each other?

1:28:26.773 --> 1:28:29.807
Oh, you're a patient of his?

1:28:29.842 --> 1:28:32.238
Not of his.
His partner, Calvin.

1:28:32.273 --> 1:28:34.581
I've known Malcolm
for a few years.

1:28:34.616 --> 1:28:37.210
Him and Calvin,
they're good men.

1:28:37.245 --> 1:28:39.421
Okay.
Well, this is my sister, Emma.

1:28:39.456 --> 1:28:41.522
<i>Please don't say it.</i>

1:28:41.557 --> 1:28:44.690
We've met, actually.

1:28:44.725 --> 1:28:46.120
Oh, really?

1:28:47.695 --> 1:28:49.189
Okay, well...

1:28:49.224 --> 1:28:51.092
I'm sorry.

1:28:51.127 --> 1:28:52.566
I got, I got to take this.
Hello?

1:28:54.471 --> 1:28:56.537
Yeah.

1:28:56.572 --> 1:28:58.033
-Okay.
-Always busy.

1:28:58.068 --> 1:28:59.166
Yeah, I'm on my way right now.

1:28:59.201 --> 1:29:00.409
Okay.

1:29:02.039 --> 1:29:03.577
I'm sorry, I gotta,
I gotta to take off.

1:29:03.612 --> 1:29:05.546
-Seriously?
-Yeah, it's... it's work.

1:29:05.581 --> 1:29:06.877
- Okay.

1:29:06.912 --> 1:29:09.583
Hey, I'll see you soon.

1:29:13.314 --> 1:29:15.556
I'm sorry, he's...
You wanna sit?

1:29:28.230 --> 1:29:31.264
<i>How did I miss this...</i>
<i>projection?</i>

1:29:32.476 --> 1:29:34.740
<i>It was obvious.</i>

1:29:34.775 --> 1:29:38.304
<i>But I've been too consumed</i>
<i>with you, I missed it.</i>

1:29:40.176 --> 1:29:41.516
<i>I know this is it.</i>

1:29:43.113 --> 1:29:45.487
<i>Maybe it should be.</i>

1:29:45.522 --> 1:29:47.280
<i>I'm losing myself to this woman.</i>

1:29:48.756 --> 1:29:51.757
<i>Once Emma tells her</i>
<i>what happened, that's it.</i>

1:30:19.655 --> 1:30:21.688
Are you okay?

1:30:21.723 --> 1:30:23.019
Um...

1:30:35.495 --> 1:30:38.573
Malcolm, I've been there.

1:30:40.467 --> 1:30:44.073
I want you to know that
if you need someone to talk to,

1:30:46.682 --> 1:30:47.978
I'm here for you.

1:30:48.013 --> 1:30:50.013
<i>Talk about what exactly?</i>

1:30:50.048 --> 1:30:52.015
Actually, yeah,

1:30:54.481 --> 1:30:56.316
I actually do need
somebody to talk to.

1:30:57.891 --> 1:30:59.154
<i>What do you know?</i>

1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:04.423
I, uh...

1:31:12.741 --> 1:31:14.103
I've been there.

1:31:15.777 --> 1:31:17.810
Yeah.

1:31:17.845 --> 1:31:19.273
We've all had our hearts broken.

1:31:24.753 --> 1:31:30.218
I'll be... here for you
if you need someone any time.

1:31:38.129 --> 1:31:39.634
Melissa, I wanna...

1:31:41.462 --> 1:31:43.033
I wanna ask you a question.

1:31:44.234 --> 1:31:45.574
Okay.

1:31:45.609 --> 1:31:46.938
And I want the truth.

1:31:53.914 --> 1:31:55.383
How do you know Veronica?

1:31:58.446 --> 1:32:00.820
I don't know anyone
named Veronica.

1:32:04.485 --> 1:32:05.924
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:32:05.959 --> 1:32:07.321
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

1:32:09.996 --> 1:32:12.524
You know, uh,
not too long ago,

1:32:12.559 --> 1:32:16.869
you told me that...
you care about me.

1:32:16.904 --> 1:32:18.068
I do.

1:32:18.103 --> 1:32:20.037
As you see me.

1:32:20.072 --> 1:32:21.775
I do.

1:32:21.810 --> 1:32:23.403
All I, all I want is the truth.

1:32:29.818 --> 1:32:31.785
I... hired her.

1:32:35.692 --> 1:32:37.120
Wait, what?

1:32:39.124 --> 1:32:40.519
I hired her.

1:32:44.668 --> 1:32:47.801
I hired her to hurt you
the way that you hurt me.

1:32:52.709 --> 1:32:54.335
You fucked my sister?

1:32:57.274 --> 1:32:58.504
Huh?

1:33:07.856 --> 1:33:08.987
<i>You were there with Zach</i>

1:33:09.022 --> 1:33:10.725
<i>for the same reason I was.</i>

1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:18.524
You were hired to be with me?

1:33:21.804 --> 1:33:23.232
Um, excuse me, sir.

1:33:24.972 --> 1:33:27.742
Do you need me to reschedule
your next appointment?

1:33:37.820 --> 1:33:39.314
No, Kevin, it's, uh, it's okay.

1:33:39.349 --> 1:33:40.579
You could send him in.

1:33:50.767 --> 1:33:52.030
- I'm sorry.

1:34:07.949 --> 1:34:11.049
Johnathon,
hey, how's it going?

1:34:12.283 --> 1:34:13.579
Uh...

1:34:13.614 --> 1:34:14.954
Yeah, I understand.
Have a seat.

1:34:19.356 --> 1:34:22.489
Sounds like you're having
some lady problems of your own.

1:34:22.524 --> 1:34:24.524
Yeah.

1:34:24.559 --> 1:34:25.624
Where's Hilda?

1:34:27.133 --> 1:34:28.561
It's just me today.

1:34:34.910 --> 1:34:36.107
Um...

1:35:05.171 --> 1:35:06.731
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I wanted what you wanted,</i>

1:35:06.766 --> 1:35:10.977
<i>Johnathon, love, a family.</i>

1:35:12.574 --> 1:35:14.673
<i>Looks like neither</i>
<i>one of us is getting that.</i>

1:35:36.598 --> 1:35:38.664
<i>Nine days since we last talked.</i>

1:35:40.470 --> 1:35:42.338
<i>We have more in common</i>
<i>than I knew,</i>

1:35:43.638 --> 1:35:45.275
<i>both living two lives.</i>

1:35:46.949 --> 1:35:49.609
<i>For a moment, I thought</i>
<i>I wanted more with you.</i>

1:35:59.489 --> 1:36:01.753
<i>What can I say?</i>

1:36:01.788 --> 1:36:06.230
<i>I tried to stop thinking</i>
<i>about you, but yet I come here.</i>

1:36:09.004 --> 1:36:10.905
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>if I ever crossed your mind.</i>

1:36:14.471 --> 1:36:15.701
Mind if I join you?

1:36:18.475 --> 1:36:19.540
Please do.

1:36:21.346 --> 1:36:22.576
What brings you here?

1:36:25.988 --> 1:36:27.053
You.

1:36:28.485 --> 1:36:30.320
-Look, I'm sorry-
-What happened between me-

1:36:32.027 --> 1:36:34.786
Wow, this is crazy.

1:36:34.821 --> 1:36:36.898
This isn't me.
I don't, I don't do this.

1:36:38.330 --> 1:36:40.627
Do what?

1:36:40.662 --> 1:36:42.970
Fumble over my words,
not sure what to say.

1:36:43.005 --> 1:36:47.733
This is, uh,
definitely new territory for me.

1:36:47.768 --> 1:36:49.339
Well, then let me go first.

1:36:52.949 --> 1:36:56.082
I was hired to hurt you.

1:36:56.117 --> 1:36:57.919
Hired?

1:36:57.954 --> 1:36:59.811
Wow. Let me, let me
ask you a question,

1:36:59.846 --> 1:37:03.485
if you didn't, would you give
a refund or that you just...

1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:05.223
Malcolm,

1:37:06.556 --> 1:37:09.656
I don't do relationships.

1:37:09.691 --> 1:37:10.822
Okay?

1:37:10.857 --> 1:37:12.263
Uh-huh.

1:37:12.298 --> 1:37:15.002
It's hard for me to trust
and not because

1:37:15.037 --> 1:37:17.004
some guy broke my heart
or anything like that,

1:37:17.039 --> 1:37:19.171
it's just...

1:37:19.206 --> 1:37:23.703
My parents, for example,
my dad was all about my mom

1:37:23.738 --> 1:37:28.180
and now that she's gone,
he's in constant pain,

1:37:28.215 --> 1:37:30.578
pain that I don't ever
want to experience.

1:37:32.054 --> 1:37:33.086
Okay?

1:37:33.121 --> 1:37:34.087
And I've learned that everything

1:37:34.122 --> 1:37:35.814
has an expiration date.

1:37:37.092 --> 1:37:38.322
even love.

1:37:41.822 --> 1:37:44.262
I don't do relationships,
either.

1:37:44.297 --> 1:37:45.395
I don't believe in them.

1:37:47.729 --> 1:37:51.269
I believe that everything
is temporary,

1:37:51.304 --> 1:37:52.974
that we all drain
the special moments

1:37:53.009 --> 1:37:54.437
in our lives so much,

1:37:56.441 --> 1:37:57.605
they're no longer special.

1:37:59.939 --> 1:38:03.952
Then I met you
and every moment was special.

1:38:06.583 --> 1:38:08.583
Like you said, everything
has an expiration date,

1:38:08.618 --> 1:38:10.783
so with the little time
we have left with our lives,

1:38:10.818 --> 1:38:13.687
I don't want to waste another
moment without you in it.

1:38:15.262 --> 1:38:17.064
I'm not saying
let's go get married

1:38:17.099 --> 1:38:18.395
or anything like that,
I'm just saying time

1:38:18.430 --> 1:38:21.761
without you in it is
a waste of time.

1:38:25.668 --> 1:38:28.768
Malcolm, I'm sorry,
I just-I can't.

1:40:57.919 --> 1:40:59.160
You followed me?

1:41:00.988 --> 1:41:02.493
You recorded our conversation?

1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:05.331
I did.

1:41:09.469 --> 1:41:10.864
You plan on releasing it?

1:41:12.802 --> 1:41:13.966
I do.

1:41:16.608 --> 1:41:17.673
Good.

1:41:21.514 --> 1:41:22.810
I thought you didn't
want them to know.

1:41:26.651 --> 1:41:28.123
I want them to know.

1:41:31.821 --> 1:41:33.623
Wait.

1:41:33.658 --> 1:41:34.987
Malcolm.

1:41:41.127 --> 1:41:44.634
<i>She knows</i>
<i>the truth, who I am.</i>

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.835
<i>There's only one thing left</i>
<i>for me to do.</i>

1:41:52.677 --> 1:41:54.446
<i>- He should just mind</i>
<i>his own damn business.</i>

1:41:54.481 --> 1:41:56.140
<i>Like, why are you doing this?</i>

1:41:56.175 --> 1:41:57.977
<i>- He wears a mask.</i>

1:41:58.012 --> 1:42:00.188
<i>- If anyone knows</i>
<i>who this man is, tell us.</i>

1:42:00.223 --> 1:42:01.816
<i>- I don't think he is real.</i>

1:42:01.851 --> 1:42:03.114
<i>- I don't think</i>
<i>he is real.</i>

1:42:03.149 --> 1:42:04.148
<i>- Did you see the video?</i>

1:42:04.183 --> 1:42:05.853
<i>He looks pretty real.</i>

1:42:05.888 --> 1:42:07.393
<i>-- He helped me.</i>
<i>-- He helped me.</i>

1:42:07.428 --> 1:42:08.625
<i>-I love him.</i>
<i>-- I love him.</i>

1:42:08.660 --> 1:42:10.330
<i>- I think he's dreamy.</i>

1:42:10.365 --> 1:42:11.991
<i>It's this envelope</i>

1:42:12.026 --> 1:42:13.762
<i>with the word Truth.</i>

1:42:15.029 --> 1:42:16.204
<i>Messiah.</i>

1:42:18.065 --> 1:42:21.473
<i>- Many of you</i>
<i>have questioned if I exist,</i>

1:42:21.508 --> 1:42:25.345
<i>by now,</i>
<i>you know the truth, I do.</i>

1:42:26.777 --> 1:42:29.712
<i>I have made a serious</i>
<i>impact on the lives</i>

1:42:29.747 --> 1:42:31.846
<i>of many with my line of work.</i>

1:42:33.421 --> 1:42:35.685
<i>You have questions,</i>

1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:38.853
<i>but your biggest question is,</i>
<i>who am I?</i>
