00:01.418 --> 00:04.296
Ribbons here!

00:01.418 --> 00:04.296
Return your ribbons here!

00:04.338 --> 00:05.881
- That's right, folks.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.881
- There you go.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.842
Thank you, sir.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.842
Right in the box, ma'am.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.969
Ribbons here!

00:07.883 --> 00:09.969
Return your ribbons here!

00:10.010 --> 00:12.011
- Kirk, stop that.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.011
- Can't stop yet, Luke.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.388
- Haven't got them all yet.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.388
- I mean it.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.765
- Put the box away.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.765
- Luke..

00:14.807 --> 00:16.183
...you and Lorelai

00:14.807 --> 00:16.183
have reconciled.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.685
I know, Kirk, I was there.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.227
And since you two

00:17.726 --> 00:19.227
have reconciled

00:19.269 --> 00:21.188
it's only appropriate

00:19.269 --> 00:21.188
that the citizens

00:21.229 --> 00:23.482
of Stars Hollow

00:21.229 --> 00:23.482
take off their pins

00:23.524 --> 00:26.234
and start to heal.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.234
In my case, literally.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.736
I caught about an inch

00:26.276 --> 00:27.736
of chest-flesh

00:27.778 --> 00:28.779
with this sharp little sucker.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.532
- Kirk--

00:28.821 --> 00:31.532
- Lulu, hey!

00:31.573 --> 00:34.242
No, Kirk! I like my ribbon!

00:34.284 --> 00:35.703
It's pink! I like pink!

00:35.744 --> 00:37.788
This is bigger

00:35.744 --> 00:37.788
than your love of pink!

00:37.830 --> 00:39.080
No!

00:39.122 --> 00:40.207
Lulu!

00:40.248 --> 00:41.750
Lulu, get back here!

00:41.792 --> 00:42.751
Lulu!

00:43.919 --> 00:45.796
Wow, did you see that?

00:45.838 --> 00:47.422
(Luke)

00:45.838 --> 00:47.422
'You know, if someone opened

00:45.838 --> 00:47.422
a store in this town'

00:47.464 --> 00:49.090
selling giant butterfly nets

00:49.132 --> 00:50.258
they'd make a fortune.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.011
Come on, the crazy

00:50.300 --> 00:52.011
need love too.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.804
Speaking of which,

00:52.051 --> 00:53.804
welcome back.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.639
- Nice to be here.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.639
- Want some coffee?

00:55.681 --> 00:58.851
Oh, say that again, slower

00:55.681 --> 00:58.851
and with your pants off.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.477
- What's that?

00:58.893 --> 01:00.477
- My pretty, pretty face?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.604
- That's a Weston's coffee cup.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.604
- Is it?

01:02.646 --> 01:03.981
You bring an enemy

01:02.646 --> 01:03.981
coffee cup in here

01:04.023 --> 01:05.399
on the day

01:04.023 --> 01:05.399
of our reconciliation.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.859
At least I didn't

01:05.440 --> 01:06.859
ask you for a favor on this

01:06.901 --> 01:08.402
the day of

01:06.901 --> 01:08.402
our daughter's wedding.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.778
Get that coffee out of here.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.321
This is not coffee.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.948
This is a mocha

01:11.363 --> 01:12.948
chocolate caramel

01:12.990 --> 01:14.324
swirl-a-chino

01:12.990 --> 01:14.324
with extra whip cream.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
- That sounds disgusting.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
- It is.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.912
And if it was physically

01:16.159 --> 01:17.912
possible to make love

01:17.953 --> 01:20.039
to a hot beverage,

01:17.953 --> 01:20.039
this would be the one.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.832
So apparently

01:20.080 --> 01:21.832
I've got competition.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.250
No, no, no.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.250
It's just a fling.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.459
I'll finally spend

01:23.291 --> 01:24.459
the night with it

01:24.501 --> 01:25.627
but then when I see it

01:24.501 --> 01:25.627
in the morning

01:25.669 --> 01:27.046
with the caramel un-swirled

01:27.086 --> 01:29.965
and the whipped cream

01:27.086 --> 01:29.965
un-whipped, huh! Buh-bye.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.260
Man, that was hard.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.306
She must have stretched first.

So, judging from the snores

02:39.994 --> 02:41.369
I'm guessing

02:39.994 --> 02:41.369
you love the theater.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.412
That was not a snore,

02:41.411 --> 02:42.412
that was a groan.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.914
It was not a painful play.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.749
Any play is a painful

02:43.956 --> 02:45.749
play for me.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.292
Well, that's too bad,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.292
because you're gonna miss out

02:47.334 --> 02:48.627
on some wonderful things.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.378
Yeah, like what?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.213
My mom took me to see

02:50.420 --> 02:52.213
"Caroline, or Change"

02:52.255 --> 02:53.799
in New York,

02:52.255 --> 02:53.799
Tony Kushner's musical

02:53.841 --> 02:56.135
and it was the most amazing

02:53.841 --> 02:56.135
thing we ever saw.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.928
Tony Kushner wrote

02:56.175 --> 02:57.928
"Angels in America."

02:57.970 --> 03:00.014
- I know who Tony Kushner is.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.014
- So you've seen his plays?

03:00.055 --> 03:02.265
No, my mom plays Canasta with

03:00.055 --> 03:02.265
him every month he's in town.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.225
Tony Kushner plays Canasta

03:02.307 --> 03:04.225
with your mother?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.519
Badly, but yes.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.062
You have a magical life,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.062
Huntzberger!

03:07.104 --> 03:08.147
And you don't even know it.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.397
So, where to next?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.066
Oh, I don't know.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.066
Mah Jongg with Mamet?

03:11.108 --> 03:12.400
- How's ice-cream sound?

03:11.108 --> 03:12.400
- Ice-cream sounds great.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.735
Then ice-cream it is.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.278
Whoa, Logan!

03:13.777 --> 03:15.278
Where are we going?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.947
- Slow down.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.947
- Slow down and you die, Ace.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.741
Yeah, you go too fast in heels

03:16.989 --> 03:19.741
and you kind of die also.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.291
- What are we doing?

03:24.663 --> 03:28.291
- We're getting ice-cream.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.251
But the dining hall's closed.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.251
We're breaking in.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.004
That's a very negative way

03:30.293 --> 03:32.004
to look at it.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.922
How do you have a key

03:32.046 --> 03:33.922
to the dining hall?

03:33.964 --> 03:36.717
I know a lot

03:33.964 --> 03:36.717
of very powerful locksmiths.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.386
Well, what happens if we get

03:36.758 --> 03:39.386
caught? Could we get suspended?

03:39.427 --> 03:40.595
They can't kick you out

03:39.427 --> 03:40.595
of school for this, can they?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.430
Hey, relax.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.430
Look around.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.851
For tonight this is all yours.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
- It is kind of cool.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
- Wait till you see the kitchen.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.647
Whoa! Oh, I've never

03:47.936 --> 03:50.647
seen the cereal station

03:50.689 --> 03:52.232
completely full before.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.860
I'm never here early enough!

03:52.273 --> 03:54.860
I knew they had Cocoa Puffs.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.237
- Then go crazy, Ace.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.237
- No, we're getting ice-cream.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.031
There's no rule that says you

03:57.278 --> 03:59.031
can't have ice-cream<i> and</i> cereal.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.324
Go on, get your Cocoa Puffs.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.452
First Cocoa Puffs of the day.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.452
This is a historic moment.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.495
[chuckling]

04:04.494 --> 04:05.495
Okay.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.663
Next stop, ice-cream.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.165
- Mm.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.165
- What are you doing?

04:08.207 --> 04:09.583
I'm looking for

04:08.207 --> 04:09.583
the swipe machine

04:09.624 --> 04:11.085
so I can deduct points

04:09.624 --> 04:11.085
from my meal plan.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.419
You're kidding, right?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.004
Well, the school pays

04:12.460 --> 04:14.004
for the food.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.048
Trust me. With all the money

04:14.046 --> 04:16.048
my family has donated

04:16.090 --> 04:17.465
to this school, they can afford

04:16.090 --> 04:17.465
to be out of a few Cocoa Puffs.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.508
Let's go.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.052
This is fun.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.469
You're an easy girl

04:20.094 --> 04:21.469
to please.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.057
- Let's hit the kitchen.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.057
- Okay.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.480
- Ace, come on.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.480
- I'm coming.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.068
Oh, okay, thanks.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.068
That's enough there.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.694
Just make sure

04:36.110 --> 04:37.694
you get the stairs now.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.239
Oh, no, those go outside.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.239
Anacencia will take care of you.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.698
Oh, what a surprise!

04:41.740 --> 04:43.366
A plate of cookies

04:41.740 --> 04:43.366
on the coffee table

04:43.408 --> 04:45.827
to match the basket of cupcakes

04:43.408 --> 04:45.827
on the reception desk.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.287
What? I always do this.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.705
Oh, you always do this

04:48.747 --> 04:50.415
when a photographer from

04:48.747 --> 04:50.415
American Travel magazine

04:50.457 --> 04:52.375
is coming to

04:50.457 --> 04:52.375
photograph us for..

04:52.417 --> 04:54.795
[speaking in unison]

04:52.417 --> 04:54.795
One of the Top Ten Inns

04:52.417 --> 04:54.795
in Connecticut!

04:54.836 --> 04:56.213
[screaming]

04:56.255 --> 04:58.257
I have no idea

04:56.255 --> 04:58.257
what you're talking about.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.092
You know, I moved

04:58.298 --> 05:00.092
the furniture in the bedrooms

05:00.134 --> 05:01.635
around four times last night.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.928
And you ended up?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.096
With everything

05:02.970 --> 05:04.096
in exactly the same place

05:04.138 --> 05:05.513
I started with.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.724
Oh, the dining room

05:05.555 --> 05:07.724
looks beautiful.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.643
- Thank you.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.643
- And what a surprise!

05:09.684 --> 05:10.894
A cake on every table.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.354
So no one has to share.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.275
Okay, floor looks good,

05:13.396 --> 05:16.275
table looks good.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.317
Hey, what happened to our books?

05:17.358 --> 05:18.526
What do you mean?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.070
All our beautiful,

05:18.568 --> 05:20.070
leather-bound books.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.614
Jonathan Swift, Edith Wharton,

05:20.112 --> 05:22.614
Charles Dickens.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.907
A lot of them are gone.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.075
The guests must

05:23.949 --> 05:25.075
have swiped them.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.576
They swiped Jonathan Swift

05:26.618 --> 05:28.870
and left me with

05:26.618 --> 05:28.870
"Clifford the Big Red Dog"

05:28.912 --> 05:31.081
and five copies of

05:28.912 --> 05:31.081
"He's Just Not That Into You."

05:31.123 --> 05:32.415
We've been airplane booked.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.293
Oh, we've got to

05:32.457 --> 05:34.293
get them out of here.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.005
Hey, Eddie? Will you get

05:34.334 --> 05:38.005
these out of here? Thanks.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.506
I'll raid Rory's

05:38.046 --> 05:39.506
leftovers tonight.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.591
Well, there everybody is.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.677
Who missed Michel?

05:43.718 --> 05:45.220
Huh. Trick question?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.554
How was California?

05:46.596 --> 05:49.516
Ah, you know, it is insanity.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.392
What is different about me?

05:51.434 --> 05:53.020
You're wearing

05:51.434 --> 05:53.020
sunglasses inside?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.813
They're not sunglasses.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.813
They are eyewear.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.941
Everyone in Los Angeles wears

05:54.855 --> 05:57.941
pairs and pairs of eyewear.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.276
Well, you look great.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.987
Oh, I tell you,

05:59.318 --> 06:01.987
I belong out there.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.324
Everybody is thin and gorgeous.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.575
Oh, there's this place

06:05.364 --> 06:07.575
on Sunset Boulevard

06:07.617 --> 06:09.119
a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf

06:09.161 --> 06:12.289
and everybody there

06:09.161 --> 06:12.289
talks exactly like me.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.748
- Wow.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.748
- 'I got Botox.'

06:13.790 --> 06:16.251
- Ow.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.251
- Dr. Wu, oh, she's a genius.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.586
Everyone goes there. And look.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.549
I got them done by the same guy

06:18.628 --> 06:22.549
who does Nick Lachey.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.885
Okay, gather around.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.885
I brought gifts.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.385
Gifts, great!

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
Oh, the shopping out there,

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
unbelievable.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.475
Rodeo Drive, dig a hole

06:29.556 --> 06:32.475
and drop me in

06:32.517 --> 06:34.602
even if I'm not dead yet.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.647
Okay, for you and for you.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.941
Oh!

06:39.983 --> 06:41.526
- Huh?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.526
- It's a smog globe.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.777
[chuckles]

06:42.819 --> 06:45.239
They are so funny in California.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.656
Well, what do you know?

06:46.698 --> 06:47.949
"He's Just Not That Into You."

06:47.991 --> 06:50.744
I heard it's a fabulous book,

06:47.991 --> 06:50.744
and so true.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.163
Oh, I haven't told you

06:50.785 --> 06:53.163
the most amazing part yet.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.413
You got your boobs done

06:54.455 --> 06:56.166
by the same guy

06:54.455 --> 06:56.166
who did Pamela Anderson?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.792
No, though I did meet him

06:56.208 --> 06:57.792
at the Coffee Bean.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.212
I was at this place

06:57.834 --> 07:00.212
called the Farmer's Market

07:00.254 --> 07:03.382
and I was just sitting there,

07:00.254 --> 07:03.382
minding anybody's business

07:03.422 --> 07:07.219
and a man came up to me

07:03.422 --> 07:07.219
and asked if I would like to be

07:07.261 --> 07:09.763
a contestant on

07:07.261 --> 07:09.763
"The Price Is Right."

07:09.804 --> 07:11.056
[gasps]

07:09.804 --> 07:11.056
You're kidding?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.725
'I was<i> so</i> stunned.'

07:13.767 --> 07:18.105
I mean, I never considered

07:13.767 --> 07:18.105
being on a game show

07:18.146 --> 07:22.276
but I was finished with my

07:18.146 --> 07:22.276
Bubble Tea so I figured why not?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.902
They just asked you to be on.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.486
- Yes.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.486
- 'Boy, that's weird.'

07:25.528 --> 07:27.239
Jackson's cousin Monty

07:25.528 --> 07:27.239
did "The Price is Right"

07:27.281 --> 07:28.698
and he told us the contestants

07:27.281 --> 07:28.698
had to get up

07:28.740 --> 07:31.368
at the crack of dawn,

07:28.740 --> 07:31.368
stand in line for hours

07:31.410 --> 07:34.037
'with hundreds of tourists,

07:31.410 --> 07:34.037
and then show how enthusiastic'

07:34.079 --> 07:35.705
'a contestant they would be.'

07:35.747 --> 07:37.958
You know, jumping up and down,

07:35.747 --> 07:37.958
screaming and yelling.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.418
- You don't say?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.418
- Yeah.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.295
And they had to wear

07:39.459 --> 07:41.295
embarrassing t-shirts

07:41.336 --> 07:44.089
that said things like, "Pick Me,

07:41.336 --> 07:44.089
Bob! I neutered my dog!"

07:44.131 --> 07:45.882
'And they spent weeks studying'

07:45.924 --> 07:47.884
'the price of Turtle wax

07:45.924 --> 07:47.884
and Hamburger Helper.'

07:47.926 --> 07:50.429
Okay, fine! I may have

07:47.926 --> 07:50.429
jumped a little

07:50.470 --> 07:51.888
'but I did not wear a t-shirt.'

07:51.930 --> 07:54.349
Michel, what would Nick Lachey's

07:51.930 --> 07:54.349
teeth guy say?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.851
Make fun if you want,

07:54.391 --> 07:56.851
but I walked away the winner

07:56.893 --> 08:01.315
of over $100,000

07:56.893 --> 08:01.315
of cash and prizes.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.024
Then what's with

08:01.356 --> 08:03.024
the cheap gifts?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.567
That's not even that smoggy.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.696
Why do I talk to you? Why?

08:08.738 --> 08:11.032
Alright, I'm gonna run over

08:08.738 --> 08:11.032
to Luke's and grab some dinner

08:11.074 --> 08:12.533
and then I will be back

08:11.074 --> 08:12.533
to finish the setup.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.785
- Got it.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.785
- Mmm.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.124
[sighs]

08:20.250 --> 08:21.960
Well, if you put it in the box

08:22.002 --> 08:23.837
like I told you to, I wouldn't

08:22.002 --> 08:23.837
have had to follow you in.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.130
- Here's your fries.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.130
- Mm, good.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
Where's the rest

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
of your burger?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.674
I ate it.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.384
- I was gone two seconds.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.384
- Ketchup, please?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
By the time I get the ketchup,

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
the fries will be gone.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.429
You're right,

08:31.178 --> 08:32.429
forget the ketchup.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.264
- Slow down!

08:32.471 --> 08:34.264
- I can't slow down.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.598
I only have 15 minutes before

08:34.306 --> 08:35.598
I have to get back to the inn.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.351
You're gonna make yourself sick.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.312
Yes, but my sickness will remind

08:37.392 --> 08:40.312
me of you so it'll be romantic.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.689
- Romantic nausea.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.689
- I get that all the time.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.274
- Hit me with the pie.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.274
- What pie?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.318
- 'The boysenberry pie.'

08:44.316 --> 08:46.318
- We're out of boysenberry pie.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.735
How can you be out

08:46.360 --> 08:47.735
of boysenberry pie?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.404
Because someone ordered

08:47.777 --> 08:49.404
the last piece.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.780
But I specifically asked you

08:50.822 --> 08:52.199
to save me a piece

08:50.822 --> 08:52.199
of boysenberry pie.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.575
- Uh, no, you didn't.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.575
- Uh, yes, I did.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.244
- When?

08:54.617 --> 08:56.244
- 'I left you a message.'

08:56.286 --> 08:58.372
- I never got a message.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.372
- I left it on your cell phone.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.041
Oh, is that what

08:58.413 --> 09:01.041
that annoying beeping sound was?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.834
Yes, it was telling you

09:01.082 --> 09:02.834
that your girlfriend called

09:02.876 --> 09:04.336
and asked you

09:02.876 --> 09:04.336
to save her some pie.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.670
Well, I don't know

09:04.378 --> 09:05.670
how to use the voicemail.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.088
You don't?

09:07.130 --> 09:08.589
'Or anything else

09:07.130 --> 09:08.589
on this stupid thing.'

09:08.631 --> 09:09.924
I know how to make a call

09:08.631 --> 09:09.924
and answer a call.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.592
- And then I'm out.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.592
- Give me that.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.094
You have got to learn

09:11.634 --> 09:13.094
how to use this thing

09:13.136 --> 09:16.931
because it is very powerful

09:13.136 --> 09:16.931
and wonderful

09:16.973 --> 09:18.475
and it will change your life.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.642
What are you doing?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.437
I am putting my number

09:19.684 --> 09:22.437
on speed-dial

09:22.479 --> 09:25.815
so all you have to do

09:22.479 --> 09:25.815
is hit one, see

09:25.857 --> 09:28.443
'cause, like,

09:25.857 --> 09:28.443
"I'm number one" and then..

09:28.485 --> 09:30.987
Oh! I wonder who that could be.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.947
- Hello?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.947
- Give me.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.574
No cell phones in the diner.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.117
- Oh, see, wasn't that fun?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.117
- Totally.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.869
Want me to put it

09:36.159 --> 09:37.869
on vibrate for you?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.538
Fifteen minutes are up.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.748
- Oh, crap, I got to go.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.748
- Take a donut.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.417
- So then Sunday?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.417
- Pick you up at 8.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.126
I'll leave you a message

09:43.458 --> 09:45.126
letting you know

09:45.168 --> 09:47.254
your chances of getting lucky.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.629
Hey, Kirk, how's the ribbon

09:47.295 --> 09:48.629
collecting coming?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.424
Oh, why do you get him started?

09:50.465 --> 09:51.925
I think we're near

09:50.465 --> 09:51.925
the finish line.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.593
- Who's winning?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.593
- Hey, this isn't a contest.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.554
- I just wanna know.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.554
- I don't care who's winning.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.596
Well, then you won't care

09:55.595 --> 09:56.596
if it's me.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.805
Well, of course it's you.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.391
You're the one

09:57.847 --> 09:59.391
that makes the costumes

09:59.433 --> 10:00.683
for the Christmas pageant,

09:59.433 --> 10:00.683
you make the ornaments

10:00.725 --> 10:02.352
for the firelight festival.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.521
You go to the town meetings.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.521
You say hello to people.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.813
You have a daughter

10:04.563 --> 10:05.813
that looks like she belongs

10:05.855 --> 10:07.357
on top of a Christmas tree.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.526
Everybody knows that gets you

10:07.399 --> 10:09.526
tons of points.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.236
There's no way

10:09.568 --> 10:11.236
to compete with that.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.653
- Kirk?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.653
- You're kicking his ass.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.364
- Yes!

10:12.695 --> 10:14.364
- This isn't a contest.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.823
No, not now it isn't.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.075
Kirk, I want a final tally

10:17.117 --> 10:18.493
because the ribbon loser

10:18.535 --> 10:21.246
is buying the ribbon winner

10:18.535 --> 10:21.246
dinner Sunday night.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.039
Loser pays?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.039
When did we agree on that?

10:23.081 --> 10:26.126
Oh, gee, I must have left

10:23.081 --> 10:26.126
that on your voicemail, too.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.127
[sighs]

10:29.003 --> 10:30.922
[cell phone rings]

10:30.964 --> 10:32.715
- Hey, mom.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.715
- Hey.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.593
How would you feel about doing

10:32.757 --> 10:34.593
a little shopping tomorrow?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.677
Hurt, confused, a little dirty.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.430
I need to get a new getting-back

10:36.719 --> 10:38.430
together-with-Luke dress

10:38.472 --> 10:40.140
for my back-together

10:38.472 --> 10:40.140
with-Luke date.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.724
Oh, where do you want to go?

10:41.766 --> 10:42.892
How about the new place

10:41.766 --> 10:42.892
where you got the scarf

10:42.934 --> 10:44.185
with the bows on it?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.728
Oh, yes, cute place.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.021
I want to go to the cute place.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.106
'10 o'clock?'

10:48.148 --> 10:49.441
I'll be the one holding coffee.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.900
So, uh, what are you

10:49.483 --> 10:50.900
doing tonight?

10:50.942 --> 10:53.111
- Mom!

10:50.942 --> 10:53.111
- 'What? Are you driving?'

10:53.153 --> 10:55.405
- Sounds like you're driving.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.405
- I<i> am</i> driving.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.865
- You are? Where you going?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.865
- You know where I'm going, mom.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.200
- Disneyland?

10:57.907 --> 10:59.200
- 'Nope.'

10:59.242 --> 11:00.619
- Puppy world?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.619
- You're so immature.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.786
You're gonna make me say it?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.121
Say what?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.248
I am on my way

11:03.163 --> 11:05.248
to Friday night dinner.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.252
Ah-ha-ha! That's right.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.252
You're on the road to Hellville.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.837
- Do not gloat.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.837
- I'm not gloating.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.339
I'm gloating with hand gestures.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.840
- Bye.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.840
- 'And a little soft shoe.'

11:13.881 --> 11:14.966
- Gotta go.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.966
- Listen.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.343
Enjoy your glazed woodcock

11:16.384 --> 11:18.970
with a side

11:16.384 --> 11:18.970
of truffled goose head.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.639
- Oh, what a shame, I'm here.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.639
- 'You are not.'

11:20.679 --> 11:22.098
- I'll see you tomorrow.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.098
- Oh, Rory, wait.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.766
I-I'm gloating with jazz hands.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.809
Bye, mom.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
Finish up, Kirk.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
I'm closing up early.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.441
You're going to see

11:29.397 --> 11:31.441
Lorelai tonight, aren't you?

11:31.483 --> 11:34.068
Actually no, she's working. I'm

11:31.483 --> 11:34.068
going to see her Sunday night.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.570
That sounds nice.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.447
You guys probably spend

11:35.612 --> 11:37.447
a lot of time together.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.115
Yes, we do.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.160
And you probably sleep over

11:39.157 --> 11:42.160
at each other's houses too, huh?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.079
Cookies are on the house, Kirk.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.079
Just go, okay?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.332
You know, Lulu's my first

11:45.121 --> 11:47.332
real girlfriend.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.334
I had an imaginary girlfriend

11:47.374 --> 11:49.334
for a while when I was young

11:49.376 --> 11:50.669
but she left me.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.212
Well, that happens.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.006
I wish Lulu and I could have

11:52.253 --> 11:55.006
what you and Lorelai have.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.091
Oh, you can have that, Kirk.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.091
You will have that.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.177
In fact, why don't you leave,

11:57.133 --> 11:59.177
and go have it right now?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.637
You know, I live with my mother.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.305
Apparently, I'm officially

12:00.679 --> 12:02.305
in this conversation.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.515
Don't know how

12:02.347 --> 12:03.515
it happened, but--

12:03.557 --> 12:05.559
My mother is allergic to Lulu.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.934
'The minute Lulu

12:05.600 --> 12:06.934
comes in the room'

12:06.976 --> 12:09.563
'mother will cough

12:06.976 --> 12:09.563
and choke and turn red.'

12:09.604 --> 12:11.981
Her throat closes up,

12:09.604 --> 12:11.981
everything gets puffy.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.274
Lulu's tried everything.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.942
She changed her soap,

12:13.316 --> 12:14.942
her perfume

12:14.984 --> 12:17.278
shampoo, cream rinse, deodorant.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.697
She's actually kind

12:17.320 --> 12:18.697
of a mess right now.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.532
- But nothing seems to work.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.532
- Kirk--

12:20.574 --> 12:22.367
Obviously I can't have

12:20.574 --> 12:22.367
mother choking

12:22.409 --> 12:23.577
three times a week, so

12:23.618 --> 12:24.827
I considered constructing

12:24.869 --> 12:26.120
a separate entrance to my room

12:26.162 --> 12:27.581
so that Lulu won't

12:26.162 --> 12:27.581
actually have

12:27.622 --> 12:28.915
to walk through the house

12:28.956 --> 12:31.585
but that's gonna cost

12:28.956 --> 12:31.585
about $40,000

12:31.626 --> 12:33.294
'cause I'd have to break through

12:31.626 --> 12:33.294
a bearing wall, and--

12:33.336 --> 12:35.838
Kirk, stop.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.838
This is ridiculous.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.340
You're a grown man.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.259
You have got to change

12:37.382 --> 12:39.259
your living situation.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.635
My mother won't move out,

12:39.300 --> 12:40.635
I've asked.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.969
I'm talking about your mother.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.638
- I'm talking about you.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.638
- Me?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.181
Yes, you. Get a life.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.349
Get some independence.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.726
- Get out of there.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.726
- But--

12:47.766 --> 12:49.852
'You wanna have a real

12:47.766 --> 12:49.852
relationship with Lulu?'

12:49.894 --> 12:52.647
- Yes.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.647
- Then grow up, be a man.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.569
I'm not sure I understand

12:55.149 --> 12:57.569
what you're saying to me.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.572
Well, Kirk, I have given you

12:57.611 --> 13:00.572
the Lincoln logs.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.073
You have to build the cabin.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.286
Lock the door behind you.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.832
You're not talking about

13:09.997 --> 13:11.832
a real cabin, are you?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.127
'Cause if a new entrance

13:11.874 --> 13:14.127
is gonna cost 40 grand

13:14.168 --> 13:15.836
then a cabin's gotta be more.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.547
'Goodnight, Kirk.'

13:17.589 --> 13:19.591
[doorbell rings]

13:19.633 --> 13:21.968
Emily! They're here!

13:22.009 --> 13:23.177
Hurry, please!

13:25.639 --> 13:28.725
Oh, my goodness, the bag

13:25.639 --> 13:28.725
is bigger than you are.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.893
I brought you some recent issues

13:28.767 --> 13:30.893
of the Yale Daily News.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.811
We've been doing some really

13:30.935 --> 13:32.811
good articles lately.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.940
And some with a by-line I might

13:32.853 --> 13:35.940
be familiar with, I hope?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.734
I believe that, yes,

13:35.982 --> 13:37.734
you'll find some

13:37.776 --> 13:39.152
highlighted sections

13:37.776 --> 13:39.152
in your hymnals.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.737
Then hand the bag over,

13:39.193 --> 13:40.737
my dear.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.820
Okay.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.282
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.701
Uh, luckily we

13:44.324 --> 13:46.701
had plenty to read.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.245
- Hello, Rory.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.245
- Hello, grandma.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.080
Let's go in the living room,

13:49.287 --> 13:51.080
shall we?

13:51.122 --> 13:52.415
Excellent idea.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.083
'Pardon me, Mrs. Gilmore.'

13:54.125 --> 13:56.419
Shall I put the salads

13:54.125 --> 13:56.419
out now, ma'am?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.630
- We haven't had drinks yet.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.630
- Yes, ma'am.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.089
'I wrote it all down'

14:00.131 --> 14:01.840
on the refrigerator pad

14:00.131 --> 14:01.840
for you, Olympia.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.510
Is someone else

14:01.882 --> 14:03.510
coming for dinner?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.762
Someone else? No.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.762
It's just going to be us.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.389
Us, meaning just

14:05.804 --> 14:08.389
the three of us here, right?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.351
I mean, you know

14:08.431 --> 14:11.351
mom's not coming.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.311
Oh. Well, actually--

14:13.353 --> 14:14.813
Of course we knew

14:13.353 --> 14:14.813
your mother's not coming.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.314
The maid made a mistake.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.609
Olympia, it was three

14:16.356 --> 14:19.609
for dinner, not four.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.611
Well, she's fired.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.904
Clear that place

14:21.653 --> 14:23.904
at once, please.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.323
Richard, take Rory

14:23.946 --> 14:25.323
to the living room.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.283
- I'll just do it myself.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.283
- Alright.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.469
Now, I had Olympia write out

14:43.424 --> 14:46.469
the reheating instructions

14:46.511 --> 14:48.137
for the goose, and they work.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.597
I had her test it

14:48.179 --> 14:49.597
during dessert.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.140
Thank you, grandma.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.851
I also put some Perry and David

14:51.182 --> 14:52.851
fruit in there.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
Oh, you can eat

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
the pears with a spoon.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.188
I'll remember that.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.188
Bye, grandpa. Bye, grandma.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.773
Bye. Bye.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.275
Bye, Rory.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.319
Well, that was

15:01.317 --> 15:03.319
a pleasant evening.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.363
Really? What dinner were you at?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.948
Well, we weren't exactly sure

15:05.405 --> 15:07.948
she was coming, Emily.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.326
I was sure.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.326
I don't understand it.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.619
Why wasn't she here?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.621
Well, I'm guessing

15:11.661 --> 15:13.621
she had something to do.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.708
Something to do? What does that

15:13.663 --> 15:16.708
mean, something to do?

15:16.750 --> 15:19.836
It means she had

15:16.750 --> 15:19.836
a previous engagement

15:19.878 --> 15:22.004
or a meeting,

15:19.878 --> 15:22.004
a dinner perhaps.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.674
I know what something to do

15:22.046 --> 15:24.674
means, Richard.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.593
My apologies, Emily.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.219
It doesn't make

15:26.634 --> 15:28.219
any sense at all.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.805
I went down there.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.805
I arranged the whole thing.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.099
She got her filthy diner

15:30.847 --> 15:33.099
owner back.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351
- What is the problem?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351
- I don't know.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.229
Lorelai is as much of a mystery

15:35.393 --> 15:38.229
to me as she is to you.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.357
I made a whole goose

15:38.271 --> 15:41.357
for three people. Wasteful.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.318
Do you think it's possible that

15:41.399 --> 15:44.318
they didn't get back together?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
- What?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
- Perhaps it didn't happen.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.239
Maybe he didn't understand

15:46.529 --> 15:48.239
what you were telling him to do.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.657
How could he not understand?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.659
I spelled it out for him,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.659
step by step.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.369
I spoke clearly and slowly.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.954
There's no way

15:53.411 --> 15:54.954
he didn't understand

15:54.995 --> 15:56.122
what I was telling

15:54.995 --> 15:56.122
him to do.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.041
Alright, then perhaps

15:56.163 --> 15:59.041
he understood

15:59.083 --> 16:00.627
but he simply didn't do it.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.045
He's not the most take-charge

16:00.668 --> 16:03.045
sort of fellow, you know.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.839
He never did follow through

16:03.087 --> 16:04.839
on my advice

16:04.881 --> 16:06.549
to franchise his diner.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.718
Oh, my God, you're right.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.718
He didn't do it.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.095
He didn't go to her

16:08.760 --> 16:11.095
like I specifically told him to.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.430
So it would seem.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.181
What an imbecile that man is!

16:14.223 --> 16:15.892
Well, you gave it

16:14.223 --> 16:15.892
your best effort.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.518
- No one can say you didn't.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.518
- I just don't believe it.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.937
Don't worry, Emily.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.147
I'm sure she'll come

16:18.978 --> 16:21.147
around eventually.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.440
And then at least

16:21.188 --> 16:22.440
we won't have to deal

16:22.482 --> 16:25.192
with them as a couple.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.570
Here, let me freshen up

16:25.234 --> 16:27.570
your drink.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.616
[sighs]

16:34.285 --> 16:35.995
If I still want that sweater

16:34.285 --> 16:35.995
in 20 minutes

16:36.036 --> 16:38.289
I'm coming back to get it.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.457
Okay, wait.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.500
What is wrong with this picture?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.376
- Huh?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.376
- You, look at you.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.629
An armful of bags and

16:42.418 --> 16:44.629
a potential 20-minute sweater

16:44.671 --> 16:46.464
on the way, and look at me,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.464
completely bagless.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.799
Relax, the day is still young.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.342
There are no more clothes

16:47.841 --> 16:49.342
out there for me.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.051
The Lorelai look is over.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.051
I wish someone had told me.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.221
- That would've helped

16:51.093 --> 16:54.221
- Oh, see, that's what I want.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.765
Hey, come on,

16:54.263 --> 16:55.765
let's follow her.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.224
I'm not following that girl.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.559
But she knows

16:57.266 --> 16:58.559
where my stores are

16:58.601 --> 16:59.769
and she looks about my size

16:59.811 --> 17:01.187
so if she happens

16:59.811 --> 17:01.187
to have an aneurysm

17:01.228 --> 17:03.606
between now

17:01.228 --> 17:03.606
and tomorrow night, what?

17:03.648 --> 17:06.192
Oh, my God. Is that Logan?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.569
It is Logan. I can't believe it.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.569
What a jerk.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.947
- Mom, it's okay.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.947
- No, it's not okay.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.907
(Lorelai)

17:10.989 --> 17:12.907
'He's sitting over there

17:10.989 --> 17:12.907
with a girl.'

17:12.949 --> 17:14.492
'Oh, no, you don't.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.492
Get me a rock.'

17:14.534 --> 17:16.452
- Mom.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.452
- I am beaning him with a rock.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.913
- Mom, stop, it's fine.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.913
- How is it fine?

17:18.955 --> 17:20.748
I'm sorry, aren't you

17:18.955 --> 17:20.748
still seeing him?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.291
- Well, yeah.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.291
- Oh, okay.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.668
So if you're still seeing him

17:23.710 --> 17:25.211
and he's over there seeing her

17:25.252 --> 17:26.546
how is that okay?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.882
Because we're keeping

17:26.587 --> 17:28.882
things casual.

17:28.923 --> 17:29.924
Casual?

17:29.966 --> 17:31.050
We see each other

17:31.091 --> 17:32.134
we see other people,

17:31.091 --> 17:32.134
and that's him

17:32.176 --> 17:33.177
over there seeing other people.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.971
- So it's fine.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.971
- Oh.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.931
- We both agreed.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.931
- Okay.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.767
If you both agreed,

17:36.973 --> 17:39.767
then okay.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.144
But aren't you guys

17:39.809 --> 17:42.144
sleeping together?

17:42.186 --> 17:43.604
Mom, it's college.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.147
Oh, right, it's college.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.316
We're both busy.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.316
We have class, we have friends.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.860
You know, it's good to..

17:48.902 --> 17:51.029
...just keep things cas..

17:48.902 --> 17:51.029
have fun, that's it.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.573
Fun? Sure, no, I get it.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.573
Friends with benefits.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.866
No problem.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.866
I watch Oprah.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.242
[sighs]

17:56.283 --> 17:59.453
Okay, so, are you sure

17:56.283 --> 17:59.453
you're cool with this?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.581
I'm completely cool with this.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.790
Okay, 'cause it just really--

18:02.832 --> 18:04.375
Mom, look over there.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.169
I think the Lorelai look

18:04.417 --> 18:07.169
is back, and it's in velvet!

18:09.296 --> 18:11.049
So, Hal, what do you think?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.593
Living room, reception area

18:11.090 --> 18:13.593
might be a nice place to start.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.678
I really need to shoot

18:13.634 --> 18:15.678
the exteriors first.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.638
- We're about to lose the light.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.638
- Oh, great idea.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.807
Well, let me tell you,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.807
we are proud of our exteriors.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.434
Why don't I get Michel

18:19.849 --> 18:21.434
to show you outside

18:21.475 --> 18:22.685
and help you set up?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.771
- Okay.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.771
- 'No-no, this is unacceptable.'

18:24.812 --> 18:26.355
Put your supervisor

18:24.812 --> 18:26.355
on the phone now.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.190
Now. Right now!

18:28.232 --> 18:30.068
Hey, everything okay, Michel?

18:30.109 --> 18:33.279
Yes, everything is fine.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.279
Lots of sunshine.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.781
I'll be right with you.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.950
I insist you do

18:34.822 --> 18:36.950
something about this

18:36.991 --> 18:40.036
before I go out and find a stick

18:36.991 --> 18:40.036
and make it pointy

18:40.078 --> 18:42.872
and come and find your cubicle

18:40.078 --> 18:42.872
and poke you very hard.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.541
Hey, tell you what, why don't

18:42.914 --> 18:45.541
I just show you outside myself?

18:45.583 --> 18:47.794
- Okay.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.794
- 'Sure, I'll hold.'

18:50.337 --> 18:51.297
'Copy.'

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
That's a look

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
of great determination.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.848
Yes, I'm determined

18:59.221 --> 19:00.848
to finish this piece

19:00.890 --> 19:02.349
before my caffeine buzz

19:00.890 --> 19:02.349
wears off

19:02.391 --> 19:04.102
and I have

19:02.391 --> 19:04.102
about 30 seconds left.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.605
So?

19:07.647 --> 19:08.606
So?

19:10.108 --> 19:11.651
Did I see you

19:10.108 --> 19:11.651
on State Street with..

19:11.692 --> 19:13.069
- Yeah.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.069
- Right.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.738
So you saw me

19:13.111 --> 19:15.738
on State Street with..

19:15.780 --> 19:16.739
Yep.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.451
- So?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.911
Are we still good?

19:21.953 --> 19:24.204
- Absolutely.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.204
- Really?

19:24.246 --> 19:25.999
Logan, we both agreed,

19:24.246 --> 19:25.999
no strings attached.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.416
- Remember?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.416
- I remember.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.376
I was just checking to see

19:27.458 --> 19:29.376
how well you remember.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.795
I remember perfectly.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.213
Okay, that's good to hear. So?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
Oh, we're not gonna do

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
the "so" thing again, are we?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.301
No, promise, no more so's.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.301
Would you take an "um?"

19:37.343 --> 19:38.636
Depends.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.636
Where's it leading?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.013
Um, are you busy

19:40.054 --> 19:41.388
or do you feel like

19:40.054 --> 19:41.388
grabbing a cup of coffee?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.473
Boy, do you have the master key

19:42.515 --> 19:43.766
to a Starbucks or something?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.476
Na, I just thought

19:43.808 --> 19:45.476
we'd walk in and pay.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.812
Wow. Old school.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.812
Sure, let's go.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.272
Okay, let's go.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.613
Yeah, there.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.613
Right there.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.823
How's it looking, Hal?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.324
I think we're good

19:58.865 --> 20:00.324
with the flowers.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.368
Let's start clearing

20:00.366 --> 20:02.368
everyone out of there.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.746
How's it going?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.874
I think we're getting ready

20:05.788 --> 20:07.874
to shoot.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.083
What are you doing?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.168
Well, just in case

20:09.125 --> 20:10.168
he doesn't have time

20:10.209 --> 20:11.418
to get a shot of the kitchen

20:11.460 --> 20:12.545
people will get to

20:11.460 --> 20:12.545
see the food.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.254
You're insane.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.254
Okay, we're ready.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.008
Well, try something else!

20:14.296 --> 20:17.008
I don't care! Just stop it!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.802
Block it with your body!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.802
Tien an Men Square! Be a hero!

20:19.844 --> 20:21.095
Um, Michel, what's wrong?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.346
I will tell you what's wrong.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.807
Ned, the bellman is wrong.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.807
He's useless.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.225
I gave him

20:24.849 --> 20:26.225
specific instructions

20:26.266 --> 20:28.602
and he ignored them.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.021
What the hell is that?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.732
(Michel)

20:30.063 --> 20:32.732
'No, no, no!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.732
Do not drive that here!'

20:32.773 --> 20:35.568
'It was not supposed to arrive

20:32.773 --> 20:35.568
for two more days.'

20:35.609 --> 20:36.986
(Lorelai)

20:35.609 --> 20:36.986
'Seriously, what is that?'

20:37.028 --> 20:40.198
My over $100,000

20:37.028 --> 20:40.198
in cash and prizes.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.240
That's what you won?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.491
That and many boxes

20:42.533 --> 20:43.826
of some sort

20:42.533 --> 20:43.826
of instant-rice dish

20:43.868 --> 20:45.786
that I have yet to feel

20:43.868 --> 20:45.786
a need to sample.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.373
[coughs]

20:49.415 --> 20:50.917
- Are you Michel Gerard?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.917
- Yes.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.251
Well, Michel Gerard, I'm pleased

20:52.292 --> 20:54.253
to present you

20:52.292 --> 20:54.253
with your motor home.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.922
Step on inside, and I'll

20:54.294 --> 20:55.922
show you how everything works.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.339
I don't want to know

20:55.963 --> 20:57.339
how it works.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.674
- I don't want it here at all.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.674
- Michel..

20:58.716 --> 21:00.093
I don't understand.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.886
After I won this monstrosity

21:01.928 --> 21:03.179
I told them I do not want it.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.513
I wanted the cash

21:04.555 --> 21:05.598
but they said

21:04.555 --> 21:05.598
they would only give me

21:05.639 --> 21:07.016
half of what it was worth.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.685
Yeah, Jackson's cousin

21:07.058 --> 21:09.685
won a washer-dryer

21:09.727 --> 21:11.353
on the $25,000 Pyramid

21:11.395 --> 21:13.147
but he decided

21:11.395 --> 21:13.147
to take half the cash value

21:13.189 --> 21:15.315
because he likes to go to

21:13.189 --> 21:15.315
the Laundromat to pick up women.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
Well, I'm not Jackson's cousin.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
I have all of my chromosomes.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.028
And I don't want half

21:17.443 --> 21:19.028
of the cash value.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.489
I want the entire $100,000

21:19.070 --> 21:22.489
that was flashing under my face.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.909
Excuse me. Do you want to know

21:22.531 --> 21:24.909
how to use it or not?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.744
'Cause the leveling jacks

21:24.951 --> 21:26.744
can be a little tricky.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.537
No, I do not want

21:26.786 --> 21:28.537
to know how to use it!

21:28.579 --> 21:30.081
Okay, enjoy your day.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.291
Drop dead and we'll discuss it.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.501
They told me I had a week

21:32.332 --> 21:34.501
before they were delivering it.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.712
I put an ad online,

21:34.543 --> 21:36.712
and I was going to sell it.

21:36.754 --> 21:37.880
And then I get a call

21:36.754 --> 21:37.880
it is coming

21:37.922 --> 21:39.173
and it has not been a week.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.259
Oh, wait, sir,

21:39.215 --> 21:41.259
could I, uh, pay you

21:41.300 --> 21:44.262
'to just take this

21:41.300 --> 21:44.262
away for an hour, you know?'

21:44.303 --> 21:45.972
Drive it around,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.972
show it the sights?

21:46.013 --> 21:48.015
Sorry, once we deliver the keys,

21:46.013 --> 21:48.015
it's out of our hands.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.851
- Uh, Lorelai?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.851
- Taking care of it, Hal.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.478
By the time

21:50.893 --> 21:52.478
all this dust clears

21:52.519 --> 21:54.272
I'm afraid, we'll have

21:52.519 --> 21:54.272
lost the light anyway.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.689
No, no, we're not

21:54.313 --> 21:55.689
losing the light.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.399
We'll keep the light

21:55.731 --> 21:57.399
and lose the dust.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.318
Sookie, get the dust busters.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.318
Michel, move this thing.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.447
- Squawk at the roast?

22:01.361 --> 22:03.447
- Michel!

22:03.489 --> 22:04.782
I don't know how it works.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.617
- 'Well, figure it out.'

22:04.824 --> 22:06.617
- You figure it out!

22:06.659 --> 22:08.035
It's like the space shuttle

22:06.659 --> 22:08.035
in here.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.829
- Okay, we're done here.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.829
- What? No!

22:09.870 --> 22:11.538
Look, it's too late.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.749
I can take some interior shots

22:11.580 --> 22:13.749
just for the hell of it.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.793
Oh, sure. Sookie, why don't

22:13.791 --> 22:15.793
you show him the kitchen?

22:15.835 --> 22:17.670
Really? Great.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.670
Follow me.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.716
You know, I can't believe it.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.718
I can't believe

22:22.758 --> 22:24.718
you had your motor home

22:24.760 --> 22:26.887
delivered here,

22:24.760 --> 22:26.887
to the inn, today.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.681
I was supposed

22:26.929 --> 22:28.681
to have a week.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.683
You know, Michel, I know

22:28.722 --> 22:30.683
the world revolves around you

22:30.724 --> 22:32.518
and we all have to understand

22:30.724 --> 22:32.518
that, but this was important.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.270
I didn't think

22:32.559 --> 22:34.270
it was coming today.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.980
You didn't think, period.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.731
You know, I don't always

22:36.022 --> 22:37.731
expect you to be a great help

22:37.773 --> 22:39.399
around here,

22:37.773 --> 22:39.399
but how about not being

22:39.441 --> 22:42.360
a super-colossal hindrance

22:39.441 --> 22:42.360
to us all, okay?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.039
Business or pleasure?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.376
"Social Origins Of Dictatorship

22:56.042 --> 22:58.376
And Democracy.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.880
Lord And Peasant In The Making

22:58.418 --> 23:00.880
Of The Modern World."

23:00.921 --> 23:03.465
- Oh. Pleasure.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.465
- Have you read it?

23:03.507 --> 23:04.884
I'm waiting for the film

23:03.507 --> 23:04.884
to come out.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.927
Yeah, I know, I heard

23:04.925 --> 23:06.927
Renee Zellweger's gaining

23:06.969 --> 23:08.512
a ton of weight

23:06.969 --> 23:08.512
to play the peasant.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.139
Listen, I was wondering

23:10.181 --> 23:12.016
if you're doing anything

23:10.181 --> 23:12.016
tomorrow night.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.518
- Oh. Um, I don't know. Why?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.518
- Well, it's Finn's birthday.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.021
He's having a party. Lots

23:14.560 --> 23:17.021
of booze, no food whatsoever.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.396
Ah, that Finn.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.482
'I was wondering

23:18.438 --> 23:20.482
if you'd like to go.'

23:20.524 --> 23:22.235
- With you?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.235
- Well, that was the plan, yes.

23:22.276 --> 23:26.322
Oh. Well, um, sure.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.241
- Yes?

23:26.364 --> 23:28.241
- 'Yes, I'd love to.'

23:28.282 --> 23:30.034
Um, let's celebrate

23:28.282 --> 23:30.034
another year of Finn.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.036
Excellent.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.036
Now, it's themed.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.038
Anything Quentin Tarantino

23:32.078 --> 23:34.038
is acceptable

23:34.080 --> 23:35.539
and I'll pick you up

23:34.080 --> 23:35.539
at your room around 9.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.333
- Sounds good.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.333
- Does it?

23:37.375 --> 23:38.416
Well, how about that?

23:40.920 --> 23:41.879
Hmm.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.512
Hey, Sookie,

23:49.011 --> 23:50.512
have you seen Michel?

23:50.554 --> 23:52.723
He was arranging a car

23:50.554 --> 23:52.723
to take the Martins to Foxwoods.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.600
I think he's showing some

23:52.765 --> 23:54.600
people the motor home.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.560
- Now?

23:54.641 --> 23:56.560
- He asked me if it was okay.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.104
I told him it was okay.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.104
Is it okay?

23:58.145 --> 24:00.356
Yeah, it's okay,

23:58.145 --> 24:00.356
but why didn't he just ask me?

24:00.398 --> 24:01.815
I think he's a little

24:00.398 --> 24:01.815
afraid of you.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.568
Afraid of me? Of kitten?

24:01.857 --> 24:04.568
Was I really that mean?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.320
- 'You were upset.'

24:04.610 --> 24:06.320
- I was mean.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.030
You know Michel.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.030
He likes to dish it out.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.865
But he's extremely sensitive

24:08.072 --> 24:09.865
when you give it back.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.951
- Yeah, I guess.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.951
- You can't even tease him.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.702
He never wore those

24:11.992 --> 24:13.702
red cowboy boots again.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.163
- Ugh, I remember.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.163
- I'm sure he'll get over it.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.831
- You know Michel.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.831
- Yeah.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.084
Hey, could you ask Eddie

24:17.873 --> 24:20.084
to get the Martins a car?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.836
You got it.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.338
What's the gas mileage like?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.090
- Hmm?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.090
- The gas mileage?

24:26.132 --> 24:28.008
It's 5,000 pounds

24:26.132 --> 24:28.008
of metal on wheels.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.385
I'm sure the mileage

24:28.050 --> 24:29.385
is fabulous.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.637
- Would you take 20 for it?

24:29.427 --> 24:31.637
- Twenty?

24:31.678 --> 24:34.390
But it's brand-new and..

24:31.678 --> 24:34.390
Oh, whatever.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.392
Twenty, sure.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.392
You got a check?

24:36.434 --> 24:38.894
Oh, whoa, whoa.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.894
Hi.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.229
What Michel means to say

24:40.271 --> 24:42.731
is that he would happily

24:40.271 --> 24:42.731
entertain all offers

24:42.773 --> 24:44.608
for this top-of-the-line

24:44.650 --> 24:46.860
streamlined,

24:44.650 --> 24:46.860
beautiful motor home.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.988
I mean, look at it.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.988
I just may buy it myself.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.489
- What are you talking about?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.489
- Offer thirty.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.201
Hey, has everyone

24:51.531 --> 24:54.201
seen inside this baby?

24:54.243 --> 24:58.331
'Cause if you haven't,

24:54.243 --> 24:58.331
you need to, seriously.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.498
And-and-and while

24:58.372 --> 25:00.498
you're taking a look

25:00.540 --> 25:04.462
please note the plush,

25:00.540 --> 25:04.462
soil and stain resistant

25:04.502 --> 25:07.047
wall-to-wall wallpaper

25:07.089 --> 25:11.844
that acts as the beautiful

25:07.089 --> 25:11.844
maple-ish paneling. Huh? Yeah.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.140
Twenty grand? You're just

25:14.472 --> 25:16.140
giving this thing away.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.475
That's what

25:16.182 --> 25:17.475
I was told to do.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.559
I didn't know

25:17.515 --> 25:19.559
about the maple-ish paneling.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.188
Michel, you can't sell this

25:19.601 --> 25:22.188
thing for $20,000.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.730
What are you thinking?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.025
Apparently I'm not.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.025
Apparently I never think.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.652
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.652
- Whatever.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.905
Michel, I was just tense

25:28.694 --> 25:31.905
about the photo shoot

25:31.947 --> 25:33.866
and I said things

25:31.947 --> 25:33.866
I shouldn't have said.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.409
You know I didn't

25:33.907 --> 25:35.409
mean them, right?

25:35.451 --> 25:38.371
- I do not know that at all.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.371
- I think you do.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.706
I think you know this inn

25:38.412 --> 25:40.706
could not run without you.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.999
And I think

25:40.747 --> 25:41.999
you know I know

25:42.041 --> 25:43.834
this inn could not

25:42.041 --> 25:43.834
run without you.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.420
What about your photo shoot?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.420
I ruined it for you, no?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.255
We rescheduled the photo shoot.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.255
Everything's fine.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.673
I could have told

25:48.297 --> 25:49.673
you they'd reschedule.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.675
Everything with you

25:49.715 --> 25:51.675
is so dramatic.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.010
So, what are we gonna

25:51.717 --> 25:53.010
do here?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.222
Oh, well, I just want

25:53.052 --> 25:56.222
the thing gone.

25:56.263 --> 26:00.267
Michel, you had $100,000

25:56.263 --> 26:00.267
flash under your face

26:00.309 --> 26:02.228
and the entire world saw it.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.104
Now, come on,

26:02.269 --> 26:04.104
go get your money.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.233
Seriously, Michel, the rube

26:04.146 --> 26:07.233
with the crossed eyes

26:07.274 --> 26:08.817
and the bolo tie,

26:07.274 --> 26:08.817
I say that's your man.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.152
He does look stupid,

26:08.859 --> 26:10.152
doesn't he?

26:10.194 --> 26:13.155
Yeah, and familiar

26:10.194 --> 26:13.155
with the, uh, ways

26:13.197 --> 26:15.282
of hooking up things

26:13.197 --> 26:15.282
to local sewer lines.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.784
- Huh? Go get 'em.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.784
- Yes, I'll zero in on him.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.162
Worse comes to worst, the woman

26:17.826 --> 26:20.162
with the elastic-waist jeans

26:20.204 --> 26:21.788
- should be a nice backup.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.788
- Attaboy.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.333
You know, If I hold out, maybe

26:21.830 --> 26:24.333
I can get $120,000 instead--

26:24.375 --> 26:26.168
- Just sell the thing!

26:24.375 --> 26:26.168
- Right.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.932
[phone ringing]

26:39.973 --> 26:41.058
- Well?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.058
- 'It's too sparkly.'

26:41.100 --> 26:42.935
It's not too sparkly.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.271
- I look like a chandelier.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.271
- What shoes are you wearing?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.022
- The pink pumps.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.022
- 'I like those.'

26:47.064 --> 26:48.399
Are they a little too

26:47.064 --> 26:48.399
"Come and get it?"

26:48.441 --> 26:50.150
Don't you want him

26:48.441 --> 26:50.150
to come and get it?

26:50.192 --> 26:52.069
Uh, yes, but I want it to be

26:50.192 --> 26:52.069
his idea to come and get it.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.779
It's not the same if the shoes

26:52.111 --> 26:53.779
tell him to "Come and get it."

26:53.820 --> 26:55.697
I really, really wanna stop

26:53.820 --> 26:55.697
saying "Come and get it."

26:55.739 --> 26:56.740
- Fine.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.740
- 'I have to get ready.'

26:56.782 --> 26:58.200
Going out?

26:58.242 --> 27:00.453
As a matter of fact,

26:58.242 --> 27:00.453
I have a date tonight.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.329
- 'Logan?'

27:00.494 --> 27:02.329
- No, Robert.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.872
- Who's Robert?

27:02.371 --> 27:03.872
- 'He's a friend.'

27:03.914 --> 27:05.583
Have I met this R-Robert?

27:05.623 --> 27:08.043
- No, you haven't met Robert.

27:05.623 --> 27:08.043
- What's his last name?

27:08.085 --> 27:09.795
Why? Do you think

27:08.085 --> 27:09.795
I'm making him up?

27:09.836 --> 27:11.255
I just wondered if I ever

27:09.836 --> 27:11.255
heard you mention him before.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.340
Um, he's just a guy

27:11.297 --> 27:13.340
I know at Yale

27:13.382 --> 27:15.468
and there's a party tonight

27:13.382 --> 27:15.468
for another guy I know at Yale

27:15.509 --> 27:18.178
and Robert Grimaldi

27:18.220 --> 27:20.431
'asked me to go,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.431
so I am going to go.'

27:20.473 --> 27:22.600
So, does this mean

27:20.473 --> 27:22.600
it's over with Logan?

27:22.640 --> 27:25.352
Nope, it just means that tonight

27:22.640 --> 27:25.352
I'm going out with Robert.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.146
And you like

27:25.394 --> 27:27.146
this Robert, right?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.646
'Right.'

27:28.688 --> 27:30.441
You know, the party's

27:28.688 --> 27:30.441
a Quentin Tarantino

27:30.483 --> 27:31.609
themed party, and you

27:30.483 --> 27:31.609
have to wear a costume

27:31.649 --> 27:33.235
so I'm going as Gogo.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.154
- 'Cause you have the skirt.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.154
- And no other ideas.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.197
Cluelessness is the mother

27:35.195 --> 27:37.197
of invention. Call me after.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.866
- I will do that.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.866
- Oh! This dress is too slutty.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.512
Are you insane? Everybody

33:31.885 --> 33:33.512
knows you can't mention

33:33.553 --> 33:35.013
anything to Kirk.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.723
I was cornered. I was tired.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.723
I wanted to go to sleep.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.767
Well, now we have to go

33:36.765 --> 33:38.767
in there and take care of him.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.727
He is now

33:38.809 --> 33:40.727
our responsibility.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.021
Uh-uh! Pottery Barn, baby.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.021
You break it, you buy it.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.523
Ah, geez.

inherit the family fortune

34:01.414 --> 34:02.916
put all my sisters

Except for the name

34:11.842 --> 34:13.010
of the parrot

34:13.051 --> 34:14.427
I stick to everything

34:13.051 --> 34:14.427
I just said.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.513
You're a fascinating

34:14.469 --> 34:16.513
specimen, Robert.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.807
- Well, Josie's a lesbian.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.807
- You struck out, Colin?

34:18.849 --> 34:20.433
Whatever.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.433
Is Lydia here?

34:20.475 --> 34:22.310
Yes. She's here

34:20.475 --> 34:22.310
with Patrick, her fiance.

34:22.352 --> 34:24.646
God, I hate these stupid,

34:22.352 --> 34:24.646
incestuous parties.

34:24.688 --> 34:25.939
It's the same people

34:24.688 --> 34:25.939
over and over.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.232
Who's as drunk as I am?

34:27.273 --> 34:29.067
No one since

34:27.273 --> 34:29.067
Spencer Tracy died.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.652
Finn, are there any

34:29.108 --> 34:30.652
interesting women here at all?

34:30.694 --> 34:32.195
Have you tried Josie?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.280
- I'm getting a drink.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.280
- Alrighty.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.533
I have to go make the rounds.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.493
- Have I met you yet?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.493
- Several times.

34:38.535 --> 34:40.328
Alright, then.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.122
- So, how about that drink?

34:40.370 --> 34:43.122
- Nothing too strong.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.499
See what I can do.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.797
- Ace, having a good time?

34:47.794 --> 34:50.797
- I am, thanks.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.131
Good. That's good.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.131
Me too.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.550
I'm having

34:52.173 --> 34:53.550
a good time, too.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.552
- Good.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.552
- Yes, it is good.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.471
So, I didn't know

34:56.887 --> 34:58.471
you knew Robert.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.432
I met him at the Life and

34:58.513 --> 35:00.432
Death Brigade gathering.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.225
- And the poker game.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.225
- Oh, right, right.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.602
Well, he must have

35:02.267 --> 35:03.602
made quite an impression.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.437
- He just asked me out, is all.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.437
- Sure.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.857
- He's kind of a jerk.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.857
- Excuse me?

35:08.899 --> 35:10.233
Robert.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.233
He's kind of a jerk.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.276
Have you noticed

35:10.275 --> 35:11.276
he's kind of a jerk?

35:11.317 --> 35:12.318
Nope.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.319
Huh.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.656
Night's young.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.656
Okay, come on.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.741
Where are we going?

35:16.698 --> 35:17.741
Logan?

35:19.325 --> 35:20.911
- You look great.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.911
- Thank you.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.749
Logan, stop.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.960
- Right. So, how you been?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.960
- I've been fine.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.087
- Good. School's good?

35:28.001 --> 35:30.087
- School's hard.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.713
Well, it's supposed

35:30.128 --> 35:31.713
to be hard.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.214
It's grooming you for life.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.259
Making you

35:34.925 --> 35:36.259
an upstanding citizen.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.555
- God-fearing Christian.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.555
- Habitual recycler.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.351
We can't do this

35:43.809 --> 35:45.351
here, Logan.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.062
- You're right. Let's go.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.062
- Go where?

35:47.104 --> 35:48.647
Your place, my place.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.647
Let's take a train to New York.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.565
- Spend the night in the Plaza.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.565
- We can't just leave.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.651
We have dates.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.527
- I don't like this.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.527
- Like what?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.404
- You here with Robert.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.404
- You're here with Whitney.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.615
- I know.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.615
- So, what's the problem?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.158
The problem is you're here with

35:58.657 --> 36:00.158
Robert, and it's bothering me

36:00.199 --> 36:01.367
and I don't like that

36:00.199 --> 36:01.367
it's bothering me.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.535
Sorry. Do you want

36:01.409 --> 36:02.535
us to leave?

36:02.577 --> 36:03.870
No, I want us to leave.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.870
You and me.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.122
I can't do that.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.331
Oh, you want to spend

36:05.163 --> 36:06.331
rest of the night

36:06.372 --> 36:07.833
with Robert instead of me?

36:07.874 --> 36:09.292
- I came here with Robert.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.292
- So dump Robert.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.919
- I hate Robert.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.919
- He's your friend.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.253
So what?

36:10.961 --> 36:12.253
I still hate him.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.131
Logan, you're the one

36:12.295 --> 36:14.131
who said--

36:14.172 --> 36:16.758
- I know what I said.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.758
- Okay, then, I have to go.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.095
I have a date.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.095
Enjoy the rest of the party.

I know. Scientists call

it the Lorelai Paradox.

- Who are you calling?

36:46.329 --> 36:47.622
- No one.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.833
Just seeing if Rory

36:47.664 --> 36:49.833
left a message.

36:49.875 --> 36:50.917
Who's washing those?

36:53.086 --> 36:55.505
Why? Was she supposed

36:53.086 --> 36:55.505
to leave a message?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.132
No, I was just hoping.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.342
We out of plastic?

36:59.384 --> 37:01.553
Why were you hoping?

36:59.384 --> 37:01.553
Everything okay with her?

37:01.594 --> 37:02.971
Yeah, she just

37:01.594 --> 37:02.971
had a date tonight.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.806
- Get four. Those tend to break.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.806
- Okay

37:07.100 --> 37:08.727
Uh, she out

37:07.100 --> 37:08.727
with that Logan kid?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.896
- No, Robert.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.896
- Who's Robert?

37:10.937 --> 37:13.272
I know nothing about him except

37:10.937 --> 37:13.272
his last name is Grimaldi.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.983
When did she

37:13.314 --> 37:14.983
break up with Logan?

37:15.025 --> 37:17.069
- 'She didn't.'

37:15.025 --> 37:17.069
- I don't understand.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.904
- It's college.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.904
- 'What does that mean?'

37:18.945 --> 37:21.573
It means, butt out, back off,

37:18.945 --> 37:21.573
none of your business.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.491
Rory suddenly decided

37:21.614 --> 37:23.491
she's dating girl.

37:23.533 --> 37:24.951
Well, that's okay, right?

37:24.993 --> 37:26.494
Isn't that what kids

37:24.993 --> 37:26.494
are supposed to do?

37:26.536 --> 37:28.163
It's just, it's not Rory.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.165
I-I don't think it's what

37:28.205 --> 37:30.165
is gonna make her happy.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.457
It seems wrong for her.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.001
- You say something to her?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.001
- No.

37:33.043 --> 37:35.087
I mean, she's been

37:33.043 --> 37:35.087
so chatty lately

37:35.128 --> 37:37.255
wanting to be able to talk

37:35.128 --> 37:37.255
about Logan and her life

37:37.296 --> 37:39.298
so now I just don't know

37:37.296 --> 37:39.298
what to do.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.967
- You talk back.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.967
- I am.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.635
But I feel like I need

37:41.009 --> 37:42.635
to be careful what I say.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.803
Oh, come on,

37:42.677 --> 37:43.803
that's ridiculous.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.222
Well, she's not

37:43.845 --> 37:45.222
at home anymore.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.514
- She's on her own.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.514
- Doesn't matter.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.183
Matters a little.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.559
You know, there have been very

37:48.225 --> 37:49.559
few times in our relationship

37:49.601 --> 37:51.394
when I ever

37:49.601 --> 37:51.394
played the "mom card"

37:51.436 --> 37:53.813
but I always had it there

37:51.436 --> 37:53.813
in my back pocket.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.190
And when I used it,

37:53.855 --> 37:55.190
she had to hear

37:55.232 --> 37:56.900
and take it

37:55.232 --> 37:56.900
'cause she lived here.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.277
And even if she didn't like it

37:56.942 --> 37:59.277
or even if she got mad

37:59.318 --> 38:01.446
the worst that would happen

37:59.318 --> 38:01.446
is she would run into her room

38:01.487 --> 38:03.073
and slam the door

38:01.487 --> 38:03.073
and blast the Jam.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.450
But then in the morning,

38:03.115 --> 38:05.450
I controlled the bathroom

38:05.491 --> 38:08.787
and the, and the pop-tarts,

38:05.491 --> 38:08.787
and she had to deal with me.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.580
Eventually, we'd make up,

38:08.828 --> 38:10.580
and it was over.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.373
- But now--

38:10.622 --> 38:12.373
- Nothing's different.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.834
Of course it's different.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.834
She's on her own.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.003
She's making

38:14.876 --> 38:17.003
her own decisions.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.422
My mom card's

38:17.045 --> 38:19.422
looking a little flimsier

38:19.464 --> 38:21.841
and I don't know how much

38:19.464 --> 38:21.841
to say to her.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.009
If she doesn't want

38:21.883 --> 38:23.009
to hear it

38:23.051 --> 38:24.427
she doesn't

38:23.051 --> 38:24.427
have to take it.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.471
She doesn't have to call

38:24.469 --> 38:26.471
or come home.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.389
She'll call.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.389
She'll come home.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.809
Yeah, I hope so.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.809
I don't know.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.897
[door opens]

38:35.939 --> 38:38.566
- Did we lock the front door?

38:35.939 --> 38:38.566
- I'll be right back.

38:42.946 --> 38:45.406
'Kirk! Get back here, Kirk.'

38:50.287 --> 38:51.704
What on earth

38:50.287 --> 38:51.704
is wrong with you

38:51.746 --> 38:53.873
besides the obvious
