WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:06.540
.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.576
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:09.477 --> 00:10.078
- I was meeting with
one of the cells.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.379
Claimed to have
recently captured

00:11.979 --> 00:13.314
a high-level IGA official.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.083
- Snyder.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.426
- Along with a lot
of other people.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.395
- I'm gonna have to report
this incident to Davos.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.430
- We had a deal.
- Terms of the deal

00:29.463 --> 00:31.332
were that the IGA
would stay out of Seattle

00:31.365 --> 00:33.667
provided that
you maintain control.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.170
It sure doesn't
look like control to me.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.405
- You killed Outliers.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.340
- Seems to be having
the desired effect.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.509
- We're supposed to believe
that Harris attacked the convoy

00:41.542 --> 00:43.211
then blew himself up en route

00:43.244 --> 00:44.645
to commit another
act of terror?

00:44.678 --> 00:46.214
They set him up.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.349
- Seems he was designated
as an Outlier.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.851
You're about to pay the price
for your arrogance.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.121
- The entire IGA
is gunning for me.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.156
Shut it down.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.590
- It's been a pleasure, Ev.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.192
- Harris said if the network
ever went down,

00:58.226 --> 01:00.228
we should meet
at a rally point,

01:00.261 --> 01:01.662
and be ready for something big.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.565
- If you are here,
that means you are an Outlier,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.134
which means
the Morks selected you

01:06.167 --> 01:07.668
to be part
of their slave army.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.338
But Mr. Kynes
put himself at risk

01:10.371 --> 01:12.340
and concealed us all
from the IGA.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.308
Now a war is coming,

01:14.342 --> 01:16.410
and our planet is gonna be
the battlefield.

01:19.447 --> 01:24.218
*

01:46.607 --> 01:48.209
- Shit.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.244
He was from
an elite Chinese unit,

01:50.278 --> 01:54.482
and she the Iranian Air Force,
two very capable Outliers.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.550
- What's the latest
Outlier inventory number?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.586
- It's 400,000 and counting.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.621
- That's not gonna be enough.
- Nope.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.623
- Well,
we need to continue the study.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.425
- Do we need to send more
Outliers to their death

02:04.458 --> 02:05.659
to prove the obvious?

02:05.693 --> 02:08.362
- This is only the
second field test, huh?

02:08.396 --> 02:10.498
We need a more robust
data set.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.266
- We're almost there.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.635
We have an analog army
that always defeats

02:14.668 --> 02:17.271
the Demis' machine-targeted
perimeter defenses.

02:17.305 --> 02:20.941
Now we arm them for the final
and most important step--

02:20.974 --> 02:22.776
killing the enemy.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.712
- We need a weapons program.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.348
- The IGA is not looking
to develop a weapons program.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.183
- Then we need
to change their mind.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.585
- The Outliers are dangerous.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.221
- Of course they're dangerous,

02:33.254 --> 02:36.424
that's why
we're recruiting them.

02:37.725 --> 02:42.396
- I'll share your opinions
with the review board.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.201
- Charming personality.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.570
- I wanna speak to her.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.306
- I'll call her back in.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.208
- Not her.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.713
- Well, that doesn't seem
like a great idea, Ev.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.582
- Do you want humanity
to survive this war?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.484
- Of course.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.487
- Then we need to speak to
the side that's going to win.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.558
- If the IGA were
to find out about this...

03:10.591 --> 03:13.427
- That's why I have you,
so they won't.

03:16.464 --> 03:23.471
*

03:53.634 --> 04:00.641
*

04:22.663 --> 04:29.703
*

04:51.592 --> 04:57.431
*

05:04.538 --> 05:11.579
*

05:21.755 --> 05:24.525
- The military directorate
was already on the ground.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.827
The IGA's crawling all over
Seattle looking for us.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.629
- They planned the hell
out of this.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.930
- Yeah, we're not gonna
be able to leave the Colony.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.566
- I don't wanna leave.
All my work's here.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.436
I've built the command bunker
for rainy days just like this.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.776
We're going to Bellevue bloc.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.745
- Moving on
to Bellevue Bloc now.

05:54.422 --> 06:01.462
*

06:10.904 --> 06:14.475
- The IGA has us boxed in.
Get Kynes out.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.743
- Move, move, move!

06:15.776 --> 06:17.411
- We're leaving.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.846
Stay right behind me.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.951
Form up!

06:23.984 --> 06:26.420
- Keep your head down!

06:26.454 --> 06:28.622
- Break right.
- Keep 'em coming!

06:28.656 --> 06:30.891
- Go! Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

06:32.526 --> 06:34.528
- Damn it, go after him!

06:36.530 --> 06:37.898
Catch 'em now!
- On your right!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.567
Covering fire!

06:39.600 --> 06:43.571
[distant gunfire,
indistinct shouting]

06:43.604 --> 06:44.838
- Gunfire, multiple shots...

06:44.872 --> 06:46.940
- Off your radio.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.477
We need your vehicle.
- Move, move, move!

06:50.711 --> 06:53.881
- I'm asking for your help.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.986
- No problem.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.657
- You never saw us.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.926
- The command bunker's a no-go
until we get reinforcements.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.596
We can't risk crossing
the bridge to Bellevue.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.931
- Let's get to Bonzo.

07:10.964 --> 07:17.971
*

07:47.000 --> 07:51.004
*

08:04.017 --> 08:11.058
*

08:39.052 --> 08:46.059
*

08:51.064 --> 08:53.634
All right.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.153
- No dogs on us yet.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.823
- Emergency network is up.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.995
The IGA is gonna
shut down anything they can.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.964
If we want a chance, we've got
to get to the command bunker

09:23.997 --> 09:27.567
in Bellevue bloc.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.674
- Signal the Outliers.
Tell them to come get us.

09:33.707 --> 09:39.579
*

09:47.287 --> 09:47.821
.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.824
- Kynes slipped the ambush.
- Of course he did.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.093
- His team is good.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.928
- One of the many things
I like about you, Lieutenant,

09:54.962 --> 09:57.130
is how you never try
to put glitter on a turd.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.902
The gateways are sealed.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.704
There are platoons
at each of them,

10:03.737 --> 10:05.005
in case Kynes tries
to get out that way.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.076
God knows what he has
stashed away out there.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.978
- Inter-bloc traffic
is locked down

10:11.011 --> 10:12.145
and all private road traffic.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.214
We're clearing the streets.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.784
Any luck restoring
the data network?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.318
- It's a black hole.

10:18.351 --> 10:22.222
Kynes designed those protocols
for just this contingency.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.092
If we want answers,
we need him.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.160
- We'll find him.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.831
- I wish I had your confidence.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.134
This Colony is
a labyrinth of his design.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.037
There's also the small issue
of the secret army

10:37.070 --> 10:40.107
of unknown size running
loose on our streets.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.843
- The network is crippled.
Kynes is on the run.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.012
Any communication he can have
with the Outliers

10:45.045 --> 10:47.781
is gonna be limited,
at best.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.917
- I've stopped
underestimating the man.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.251
So should you.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.022
- You know, if we could
scramble those drones,

10:55.055 --> 10:57.157
we'd have Kynes zeroed
in a couple hours.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.192
- IGA doesn't want
to involve the Hosts.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.128
- They may not have a choice.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.096
- We should both pray that
it doesn't come to that.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.366
Until then,
we're on our own.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.803
Someone must know something.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.155
- Nothing.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.359
The gym.
- Yeah.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.897
- Maybe Kynes brought
the network back up,

11:36.930 --> 11:38.932
signaled the Outliers?

11:38.966 --> 11:42.870
- Maybe.
- Or maybe it's a death trap.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.238
- I gotta let Broussard know.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.241
- The kids are in bed.
I'll come with you.

11:51.278 --> 11:56.850
*

11:56.884 --> 11:59.920
- Unit Whiskey-82,
come in.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.358
Wake up, Whiskey-82.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.266
This is Whiskey-82.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.336
- You're being forced.
We need you to come in.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.276
- Now.
It's all hands on deck.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.249
- Copy.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.931
*

12:46.299 --> 12:52.372
*

12:52.405 --> 12:55.242
- Keep it moving, all right.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.146
- He's done.
- All right, move aside.

12:59.179 --> 13:03.450
*

13:03.483 --> 13:05.385
- Stay alert.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
- My fare needs to get to work.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.197
- SRMA.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.300
- Operator's license.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.303
- My phone is dead.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.106
- Let me see the hard copy.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.418
- Mind if I ask
what's going on?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.153
- Yeah.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.321
Go on.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.926
Let 'em through.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.296
- Letting one through.

13:49.329 --> 13:55.402
*

13:59.439 --> 14:01.174
- It's martial law out there.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.177
Huge IGA
military mobilization.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.046
They're setting up checkpoints,

14:06.079 --> 14:07.314
taking private traffic
off the street.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.149
- Sounds familiar.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.584
- And there's this.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.254
Did your phone
come back up yet?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.556
- No.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.060
- An emergency protocol
sent just to the Outliers.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.262
- Kynes.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.199
- I think he's declared war
on IGA.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.068
- Could also be an easy way
for the IGA

14:28.101 --> 14:31.038
to round up all the Outliers
and clean them out.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.241
- Only way to find out
is go scout that meet.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.277
- All right.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.545
- I'll contact you
as soon as I can.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.480
- I'm coming with you.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.484
Bram's there.
He can handle it.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.253
I'm not gonna sit at home
and watch this place

14:46.286 --> 14:49.089
turn into Los Angeles.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.358
- Somebody has to stay behind.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.460
- I will.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.428
I've gotta wait somewhere.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.397
May as well do it
at your place.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.368
- If we're more than two hours,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.203
would you wake the kids up
and bring them here?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.372
- Sure.
- Thank you.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.510
*

15:19.352 --> 15:20.620
- Hey,
your attention, everyone.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.590
Can I have your
attention please?

15:23.623 --> 15:27.094
There's been a change
of leadership in Seattle.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.663
Everett Kynes has
stepped down as governor.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.665
Now, the IGA has stepped in
to handle the transition

15:32.699 --> 15:35.302
to make sure that
it goes smoothly.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.105
As officers of the
Seattle Community Patrol,

15:38.138 --> 15:42.242
our job is to do
anything we can to help.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.211
Now, we will be liaising

15:44.244 --> 15:46.413
with the IGA teams
to secure the Colony,

15:46.446 --> 15:49.382
which means you will all
be issued new sergeants.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.683
Carry on.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.356
Everybody hang tight.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.326
We're gonna try and make this
as painless as possible.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.262
Thank you all
for your continued service.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.035
.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.338
- I hoped to not be
in this position.

16:12.839 --> 16:12.872
- I'm sure you never expected
to see my face on your phone.

16:14.007 --> 16:14.707
This is a confusing moment
for all of us.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.076
Things are changing.

16:16.109 --> 16:20.047
Humanity is at a crossroads.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.649
You are the men and women
who get to decide

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
where it goes from here.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.487
Seattle was designed

16:27.520 --> 16:29.689
to be the paradigm
for all Colonies.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.559
The way to control
a democratic society

16:32.592 --> 16:35.495
isn't through fear--
it's through distraction.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.431
A happy Colony that
still gives the Host

16:38.465 --> 16:39.699
the resources they needed.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.102
My model was a success,

16:42.135 --> 16:45.038
and the IGA loved me for it.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.741
But that love blinded them
to my true goal--

16:48.775 --> 16:51.711
preparing for the day
the war ends,

16:51.744 --> 16:55.348
when the Host and the enemies
are dead or gone.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.451
Hidden in the walls
of this Colony are the means

16:58.485 --> 17:02.055
to fight a real war
against the Global Authority,

17:02.089 --> 17:03.623
and I hold the keys.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.693
Our enemy wants to erase

17:06.726 --> 17:10.063
me and my work
from existence,

17:10.097 --> 17:14.501
and without your help,
they will succeed.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.737
I'm sending my location
to your phones.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.573
I believe in a future

17:20.607 --> 17:23.410
that isn't governed
by the IGA.

17:24.677 --> 17:28.115
I'm asking you
to believe with me.

17:28.148 --> 17:35.188
*

17:35.688 --> 17:38.191
- Yes.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.629
- 'Course I do, but men
who trust power tend to have

17:42.662 --> 17:44.731
short life expectancies.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.566
- If this was a trap,

17:46.599 --> 17:50.403
they'd have rounded us up
already or nuked the building.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.871
Look around, man.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.407
This is a movement.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.244
We have to throw in
with somebody eventually

17:57.277 --> 17:59.812
or else what are we doing?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.187
- Yeah.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.258
- Ford's got Kynes inside
one of Seattle Initiative's

18:11.291 --> 18:14.161
black sites--they're alone,
but the building's secure.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.664
- It's an armory.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.635
- Like a whole bunch of badass.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.271
But we're short on medics.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.639
- My partner's a doctor.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.842
- She's ready.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.844
- Okay.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.682
Kit up and meet back here
at 00:00.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.718
Ford wants us in and out
before daybreak.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.292
*

18:45.325 --> 18:48.161
- We need to talk to Bram
before we do anything.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.762
- Sure.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.203
- Move!

19:09.216 --> 19:11.551
- Have you enjoyed your work
with the Community Patrol,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.886
Sergeant...
- Barnes.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.257
- Yes, sir, I have.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.859
- Good.
That should make this easy.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.728
Everett Kynes has
committed treason

19:21.761 --> 19:23.563
against the IGA and our Hosts.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.233
He was using this Colony
for his own gain,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.735
flouting authority
with his every breath.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.670
And that makes you

19:30.703 --> 19:34.241
the agent of a rogue state.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.643
- I'm just a
public safety officer, sir.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.712
- Even if that were true,
do you think we care?

19:43.750 --> 19:44.951
- Is that an indication
that I should

19:44.984 --> 19:47.520
cut to the chase, Sergeant?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.924
Earlier this evening,
Everett Kynes evaded arrest.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.361
His co-conspirators
killed a number

19:54.394 --> 19:56.863
of our IGA soldiers
in the process.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.699
Witnesses indicate that
a Community Patrol unit

19:59.732 --> 20:01.601
aided in the escape.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.704
We've begun by speaking
with every Sergeant.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.273
Next, it'll be every officer.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.342
The person who speaks up
will keep their income,

20:09.376 --> 20:12.812
their property,
and their freedom.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.549
But anyone found to be
hiding something...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.552
- He knows.

20:21.388 --> 20:25.392
- He may look like a Doberman,
but Mr. Garland is very smart.

20:25.425 --> 20:29.829
*

20:29.862 --> 20:33.666
- My allegiance is to the IGA,
sir, not Kynes.

20:34.701 --> 20:38.671
Tell me what you want.
I'll do my best to provide it.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.774
- I wanna know
where Kynes went.

20:41.808 --> 20:47.580
*

20:47.614 --> 20:49.382
- Uh...

20:51.651 --> 20:53.620
There are two officers
in my division

20:53.653 --> 20:55.888
that you should talk to.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.357
But they're just kids, right?
They're--

20:57.390 --> 20:59.759
- Names.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.972
- Not a creature stirring.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.641
- Thank you.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.610
- Kynes is on the run.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.045
Put out a call to the Outliers
to come pick him up

21:19.078 --> 21:20.680
before the IGA does.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.715
- Sounds dangerous.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.951
- Let's talk.

21:35.094 --> 21:42.335
*

21:47.440 --> 21:50.710
We're going in
to get him tonight.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.645
- Does the IGA know
where he is too?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.714
- Unknown.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.384
- You have a team
of professionals,

21:57.417 --> 21:59.352
just like you always wanted.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.053
Shouldn't that put you
in a better mood?

22:02.922 --> 22:04.924
- We're short on medics.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.728
- I don't have
that kind of training.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.030
- You can do it.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.769
- Kynes is hiding out
at one of his black sites.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.706
We have to go in and get him
before the bad guys do.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.877
- And if the bad guys
do get to him?

22:24.911 --> 22:27.414
- I'll handle the shooting,
you handle the repairs.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.385
- You believe that Kynes
is worth the risk?

22:34.053 --> 22:38.057
- Only so much damage
one man with a gun can do.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.792
If the balance
is ever going to shift

22:39.826 --> 22:41.894
in the Resistance's favor,

22:41.928 --> 22:44.931
it's gonna be because
of a man like Kynes.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.104
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't need you.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.481
- Okay.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.426
- We need to wake up
Bram together,

23:13.460 --> 23:14.861
tell him what's going on.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.930
- No, we don't.

23:17.964 --> 23:21.000
- He needs to know
what we're doing.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.972
- You're not coming.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.743
- The Outliers
are trained soldiers.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.011
You're not.
- I'm trained.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.846
- Not like them,
and even if I backed you,

23:33.880 --> 23:35.848
the others would balk.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.122
- You're a liability.

23:47.627 --> 23:51.197
*

23:51.230 --> 23:54.467
- This is not your choice.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.135
- Tell her.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.772
I am a part of this.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.842
- You'll get your chance
another time.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.512
- She's a doctor.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.215
- "She" will now
excuse herself.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.485
*

24:12.519 --> 24:15.121
- You are unbelievable.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.227
I have been fighting
this Occupation

24:21.260 --> 24:23.162
for a lot longer
than you have.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.966
Why do you want this?

24:26.999 --> 24:30.469
- Because they turned me
into a collaborator.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.040
I went to work
in that refugee camp

24:34.073 --> 24:36.609
because I needed
to help people.

24:36.643 --> 24:40.847
And they exploited that and
I have gotta make that right.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.551
- Give all that to the kids.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.187
Make it right by
being there for them.

24:48.220 --> 24:52.291
They need you.
- They need you.

24:56.629 --> 25:00.066
They're better off without me.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.938
*

25:08.608 --> 25:15.648
*

26:02.695 --> 26:02.862
.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.564
- Hey, wake up.

26:06.032 --> 26:06.999
We have to go.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.303
- Another war is starting
and it's not safe here.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.809
- I have someplace we can go.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.380
Hey, trust me, okay?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.616
- I trust you.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.753
- Come on, let's pack up
your stuff quietly.

26:36.763 --> 26:42.669
*

26:44.070 --> 26:46.873
Come on, let's go.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.743
Hey.

27:16.202 --> 27:19.806
- I don't look much like
Everett Kynes, do I?

27:19.839 --> 27:22.675
Alan Snyder,
Interim Global Authority.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.945
Turns out that the
beloved Governor Kynes

27:25.978 --> 27:27.947
is one of the worst traitors

27:27.980 --> 27:31.083
in the short history
of our new world order.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.753
"What does that have to do
with us," you ask yourselves.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.689
"We're just Community Patrol.
We're working for beer money."

27:36.723 --> 27:38.090
That's what I thought too.

27:38.124 --> 27:42.194
But then, I had a very
illuminating conversation

27:42.228 --> 27:45.097
with Sergeant Barnes.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.867
How quickly he sold you out.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.004
- You're gasping when
you should be speaking.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.940
- I don't know where they went.

27:53.973 --> 27:56.142
- That's not gonna help you
or your friend.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.810
- Get up.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.182
They--they said they were
going somewhere.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.088
- Some place called Bonzo.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.772
- I think so.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.181
- That's it.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.959
- It's like a clearance bin
at some backwater gun show.

28:46.993 --> 28:50.296
- Could be worse.
- Could always be worse.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.898
- Before we go out there,

28:51.931 --> 28:53.199
I need to know that
you're straight.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.968
- I'm fine.

28:56.002 --> 28:59.138
- If you wanna hurt yourself,
that's your deal,

28:59.171 --> 29:01.841
but I can't let you do it here.
- I said I'm fine.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.176
- I know what
I'm looking at, Will.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.116
- I'm at peace with things.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.484
That's it.

29:14.553 --> 29:20.259
*

29:20.292 --> 29:22.294
- We found Bonzo.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.800
- It's a code name for
one of Kynes' black sites.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.501
- We've earned a little luck.

29:29.535 --> 29:33.039
- Well,
don't get too excited.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.942
- It's in an old
federal reserve building.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.810
We think it's an armory.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.546
We have to go in hard.
- This is our last shot at him.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.016
Either bring him in alive,
or kill him there.

29:53.459 --> 29:53.792
.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.228
Go.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.464
Falling back.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.400
Move, move.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.502
- We're outside.
Looks clear.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.306
- Go.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.574
- We're on the
lowest sub-level

30:08.607 --> 30:10.242
on the east side
of the building.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.911
- Copy.
We're on our way.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.013
Go.
Keep on the move.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.950
Hurry up.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.385
We're at the
front door entrance.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.955
Going in.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.958
*

30:25.992 --> 30:27.559
- There's a stairwell
at the end of your corridor.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.295
Take it all the way down.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.497
- East stairwell's clear.

30:31.530 --> 30:36.335
*

30:36.368 --> 30:37.469
- Ford.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.872
- A door.
- Got it.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.041
Breach.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.943
- Enemy units have
surrounded the building.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.613
- Two minutes.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.415
- Pick up the pace.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.950
- Two minutes.

30:53.953 --> 31:00.993
*

31:03.963 --> 31:05.264
- Move it.
Move it.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.266
- Hold.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.037
Move up.
Southwest stairwell.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.973
- Will.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.943
- Get Kynes.
We'll slow them down.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.610
- Let's go.

31:27.519 --> 31:30.322
- Keep moving.

31:31.958 --> 31:37.596
*

31:41.733 --> 31:45.004
[indistinct shouting,
distant gunfire]

31:47.006 --> 31:48.540
- Keep your eyes on the road.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.417
- We're at the door.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.487
- Be ready.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.498
*

32:12.531 --> 32:14.933
- Let's go.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.371
- All right, on me.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.097
Get down.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.433
Move up.
Move up.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.001
- Move it.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.706
- Hold your fire.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.644
- Leave him.
He's gone.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.013
- Let me work.
- I said leave him!

33:01.047 --> 33:02.681
- Hold your position.

33:08.654 --> 33:12.491
Get behind me.

33:14.160 --> 33:21.400
*

33:31.810 --> 33:33.779
- They're all over the place.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.115
- The best way out is
through the parking structure.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.784
- Go.
I'll keep them busy.

33:41.820 --> 33:49.027
*

33:53.099 --> 33:56.502
Meet you at the rally point.
- Let's go.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.538
- You watch the doorways.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.574
- You guys come with us.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.248
- Move.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.187
Hurry up.

34:21.260 --> 34:28.467
*

34:53.825 --> 35:00.499
*

35:00.532 --> 35:02.201
- Here she is.
- There they are.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.503
- Take 'em out!

35:09.608 --> 35:11.710
- Enemy contact
in the parking garage.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.345
Kynes is hit.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.114
We need cover.
We're bringing him out.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.126
- All clear.
We're moving out.

36:13.505 --> 36:13.672
.

36:16.942 --> 36:23.582
*

36:51.543 --> 36:57.283
*

37:12.631 --> 37:15.301
- I didn't know
where else to take her.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.739
- You did the right thing.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.676
This room's clear

37:49.635 --> 37:52.304
You okay?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.473
- Body armor
got the worst of it.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.041
- I didn't notice Kynes
amongst the dead.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.509
- I hit him myself.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.077
Unless he's got
a fairy godmother

37:59.110 --> 38:01.380
and a level-one trauma unit
we don't know about,

38:01.413 --> 38:02.614
he's toast.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.583
- This is a real mess.

38:05.851 --> 38:08.620
- No shit.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.489
You hand me 20 Outliers

38:10.522 --> 38:12.724
and you see how different
the results are.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.427
- I might be able
to arrange that now.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.366
The good news is
that you were right.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.768
This appears to have been
Kynes' private armory.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.870
I don't care how good
his Outliers are.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.773
Without weapons,
he doesn't have an army.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.675
- Shall we call it a victory,
then?

38:29.708 --> 38:32.844
- I need you back
on the field right away.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.648
- I'll be there.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.823
*

38:46.692 --> 38:48.927
- I need to open the rib cage
to find the bleed.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.098
- I need two O Negative donors.

38:53.131 --> 38:56.635
Three is better.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.806
- Negative.
- Negative.

39:03.842 --> 39:08.947
*
