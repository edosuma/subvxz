00:00.513 --> 00:02.913
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.915 --> 00:05.583
You are going to kill the President
of the United States, Ellen.

00:05.585 --> 00:08.386
Otherwise, we will kill your family.

00:09.455 --> 00:11.922
We need to end
this investigation tonight.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.677
And how are we supposed to do that?

00:13.712 --> 00:15.192
We give them somebody to blame.

00:15.194 --> 00:19.963
- Everything go okay with the nurse?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

00:22.733 --> 00:25.501
- We're going to escape.
- What?

00:25.503 --> 00:28.104
I'll stay behind,
I'll act as a decoy.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.376
- Where's your wife, Brian?
- Gone.

00:36.012 --> 00:38.446
Where is she?

00:38.448 --> 00:41.116
I'll meet you at the bus station
on Glebe at 2:00 p.m.

00:41.118 --> 00:43.986
Where are Mom and Dad?
They should be here by now.

00:44.488 --> 00:47.602
Mom said they'd come.
Let's give her some time.

00:49.857 --> 00:51.825
Keep going, sweetheart.
He doesn't know where you are.

00:51.827 --> 00:53.360
We did it. Just keep...

00:53.362 --> 00:54.461
Oh, God!

00:56.864 --> 01:00.267
He's still alive, but I have
no idea how long he'll last.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.052
That's up to you, Doctor.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.632 --> 01:35.066
Get him up.

01:35.068 --> 01:37.034
Get me all the towels
you can find.

01:37.036 --> 01:38.502
Give me your knife.

01:41.039 --> 01:43.508
I searched a four-block radius
around the school.

01:43.544 --> 01:44.886
The kids are in the wind.

01:44.921 --> 01:47.245
You shot him,
now you're trying to save him?

01:47.247 --> 01:48.779
I need you to check
the local police scanners,

01:48.781 --> 01:50.681
see if any cars were stolen
near the high school.

01:50.683 --> 01:52.316
And check all the surveillance video
you can.

01:52.347 --> 01:54.284
Airports, train stations, and bus stations.

01:54.419 --> 01:58.122
- Jake and Morgan can't have gone far.
- And Ellen?

01:58.124 --> 02:01.658
- She'll come back for him.
- No, she won't.

02:09.699 --> 02:13.169
- Mom and Dad should be here by now.
- I know.

02:15.105 --> 02:18.340
Morgan?
Do we get on the bus or not?

02:21.145 --> 02:23.445
Let's get on the next bus.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.651
- Where the hell is Archer?
- I don't know.

02:29.653 --> 02:31.452
Find him.
Tell him to get his ass back here.

02:31.454 --> 02:33.749
If we don't do something soon,
this guy's gonna die.

02:33.782 --> 02:35.684
Just get a hold of Archer.

02:37.427 --> 02:39.928
No cars are reported stolen
near the kids' school.

02:39.930 --> 02:42.730
- Airport surveillance footage is a bust.
- Keep looking.

02:43.399 --> 02:45.166
This is taking too long.

02:46.802 --> 02:49.036
- Where is your family?
- They're gone.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.171
Wrong answer.

02:54.476 --> 02:58.369
- Let's try this again. Where are they?
- Go to hell.

03:01.508 --> 03:03.110
Stop it!

03:03.251 --> 03:06.807
If you want my help, get that
woman away from my husband.

03:32.562 --> 03:35.931
You don't want him to die.
The kids are gone.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.267
If you lose Brian,
you have no leverage over me,

03:38.269 --> 03:40.340
and I'll never do what you want.

03:40.903 --> 03:42.871
Step off. Now.

03:48.277 --> 03:50.846
Ellen, no...

03:50.848 --> 03:53.782
Oh, God. There's too much damage.
We have to take him to the ER.

03:53.784 --> 03:55.992
- Brian stays here.
- I need to operate.

03:56.064 --> 03:58.004
- So do it.
- I don't have everything I need.

03:58.077 --> 04:00.153
- It's dangerous.
- I have faith in you, Ellen.

04:00.188 --> 04:02.823
Why did you come back?
I told you not to come back.

04:10.431 --> 04:13.000
Damn it, he's bleeding out!

04:13.002 --> 04:15.168
Where did you hide my trauma kit?
I need it.

04:16.637 --> 04:18.471
I can't help him without it!

04:20.240 --> 04:21.940
Help Dr. Sanders.

04:27.514 --> 04:31.784
Okay, something went wrong.

04:31.786 --> 04:33.167
Morgan Sanders.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.918
Morgan Sanders,
please come to the ticket counter.

04:35.953 --> 04:37.764
They're here. Let's go.

04:39.625 --> 04:42.178
Hi, I'm Morgan Sanders.
I was just paged?

04:42.218 --> 04:44.125
Just a second.

04:45.431 --> 04:46.964
Do you see them?

04:46.966 --> 04:48.132
No.

04:48.134 --> 04:49.874
Here you go.

05:11.456 --> 05:13.123
They'll catch up with us later?

05:13.125 --> 05:15.558
What is that supposed to mean?
Where are they?

05:20.530 --> 05:25.868
We missed the 2:45 to Montreal.
When's the next bus?

05:25.870 --> 05:27.770
4:10, bus 618.

05:28.972 --> 05:30.940
Okay, uh, two tickets, please.

05:38.781 --> 05:40.181
Take over CPR.

05:48.457 --> 05:49.690
Your hand...

05:55.396 --> 05:57.197
Clear!

06:01.101 --> 06:02.568
CPR and pressure.

06:09.643 --> 06:11.610
Come on. Come on.

06:11.612 --> 06:12.711
Clear!

06:17.183 --> 06:18.850
Still no pulse.

06:23.156 --> 06:26.024
Come back to me, Brian.
Right now.

06:26.026 --> 06:28.059
Right now, damn it!

06:29.529 --> 06:30.561
Clear!

06:33.332 --> 06:35.066
We have a pulse.

06:35.068 --> 06:36.099
Keep applying pressure.

06:36.137 --> 06:38.495
Pull over a floor lamp,
I'm gonna hang an IV bag.

06:48.078 --> 06:51.548
- You reach Archer?
- I left word. Nothing.

06:54.586 --> 06:55.686
It doesn't make any sense.

06:55.759 --> 06:58.752
Mom came to drop off the envelope,
why would she leave?

06:58.787 --> 07:00.990
- I don't know.
- You think she had to pick up Dad?

07:00.992 --> 07:03.326
I have no idea!
Stop asking me questions!

07:08.465 --> 07:10.866
The bullet went through.
That's the good news.

07:10.868 --> 07:13.836
- But it damaged your renal vein.
- Can you fix it?

07:13.838 --> 07:15.067
Yeah, but I need to open you up

07:15.102 --> 07:17.428
to repair the vein
and stop the bleeding.

07:17.475 --> 07:19.041
Okay.

07:19.043 --> 07:21.276
I can give you a local
anesthetic to dull the pain,

07:21.278 --> 07:23.130
but I don't have anything
to put you under.

07:23.171 --> 07:24.648
It's gonna hurt.

07:24.683 --> 07:27.114
Let's...
Let's just get it over with.

07:29.485 --> 07:33.521
We found the kids. Bus station.
Not sure what bus they're on.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.392
Go find 'em. Now.

07:38.394 --> 07:39.861
They're gonna make it.

07:44.466 --> 07:47.068
- Where the hell have you been?
- We need to talk.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.806
When I call you,
you answer the damn phone...

07:53.808 --> 07:55.408
- We got a problem.
- What?

07:55.410 --> 07:57.767
It's about the nurse.
There's a complication...

07:57.806 --> 08:00.344
I know. The Secret Service
is still looking for her.

08:00.415 --> 08:03.016
- They assigned me to the case.
- She's dead, D.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.287
What?

08:08.289 --> 08:10.742
Things didn't work out as planned.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.364
Why didn't you tell me?

08:16.401 --> 08:18.768
'Cause you got enough
on your plate right now.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.833
You said, "The less everybody knows,
the better."

08:21.835 --> 08:24.702
- Protects us all.
- This is different.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.788
What the hell happened?

08:28.275 --> 08:30.431
I was dropping her off
with Malik for safekeeping

08:30.467 --> 08:32.056
when she tried to run.

08:33.345 --> 08:36.080
- Somebody help me! Please!
- Started yelling for help.

08:37.249 --> 08:38.839
So I shot her.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.686
Truth is, I should have killed her
as soon as I got her out of that bar.

08:43.688 --> 08:47.024
Keeping her stashed away
for two weeks...

08:47.026 --> 08:49.293
It never made sense.
It's too risky.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.996
- I don't accept that.
- You're living in a fantasy world, man.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.531
You think we can pull this off
and no one gets hurt?

08:55.533 --> 08:57.400
Impossible.

08:57.402 --> 08:58.694
You don't get to kill the President

08:58.729 --> 09:01.305
and keep your hands clean
at the same time.

09:03.740 --> 09:07.376
- Where's the body?
- In Malik's storage unit.

09:07.378 --> 09:09.711
But the cops'll find it
if we don't move soon.

09:09.713 --> 09:12.780
Malik got busted yesterday
with a kilo of coke.

09:19.088 --> 09:20.621
That's our bus.

09:24.961 --> 09:26.361
It's her.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.398
- Did she see us?
- I don't know.

09:52.787 --> 09:54.187
Okay, let's go.

10:05.699 --> 10:07.733
You gonna do that
all the way to Canada?

10:10.136 --> 10:12.404
We can't leave
without Mom and Dad.

10:19.111 --> 10:20.311
Okay...

10:21.814 --> 10:24.181
We're gonna be okay.

10:24.183 --> 10:26.951
Bus 618, this is dispatch. Pick up.

10:26.953 --> 10:28.987
Dispatch, this is 618.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.127
We've got one more passenger
en route. She won't be long.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.231
She found us, didn't she?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.751
What do we do?

10:52.790 --> 10:55.500
We took out the chips.
How the hell did she find us?

11:32.238 --> 11:34.106
Sir, I just feel like I'm gonna
have a nervous breakdown

11:34.108 --> 11:35.675
if I don't find these kids.

11:35.677 --> 11:38.677
I've only been their nanny for two weeks,
but they hate me.

11:38.679 --> 11:41.446
And the last time they ran away,
I found them here...

11:41.448 --> 11:43.214
So, I was wondering if I could

11:43.216 --> 11:46.017
look at video footage of the loading
areas of the last couple of hours...

11:46.019 --> 11:48.553
- Are you a cop?
- No.

11:48.555 --> 11:50.562
Then, no.

11:59.430 --> 12:02.799
Is this enough to buy me a badge?

12:02.801 --> 12:06.001
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- "Bribe" is such an ugly word.

12:06.003 --> 12:09.004
So is "incarceration."
What's your name?

12:10.140 --> 12:11.173
Hey!

12:25.788 --> 12:27.055
Sandrine Renault?

12:28.224 --> 12:30.258
- Who wants to know?
- I'm a private detective.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.259
You're a tough woman to track down.

12:32.261 --> 12:34.428
So why don't you tell whoever hired you
that you couldn't find me,

12:34.430 --> 12:37.064
- and we'll call it even.
- Can't do that.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.668
- Sure you can.
- Victor expects results. And his money.

12:43.271 --> 12:44.805
I'm a little short.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.374
Oh, sorry to hear that.

12:48.409 --> 12:50.677
We'll take that.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.111
Let's go for a drive.

13:06.761 --> 13:10.128
Sorry. That's the worst of it.

13:10.130 --> 13:11.730
Move that lamp closer.

13:18.137 --> 13:21.639
There's too much blood in the field,
I can't visualize the injury.

13:23.442 --> 13:25.743
Glove up. I need you.

13:41.526 --> 13:44.027
Okay, don't move,
or he'll bleed out.

14:05.582 --> 14:08.317
I know you're in there!

14:08.319 --> 14:12.124
Morgan! I can see the lights on!
Open the door!

14:14.625 --> 14:17.125
Answer the door
before he comes around back.

14:17.127 --> 14:18.660
I'm not finished.
I can't just walk away!

14:18.662 --> 14:22.530
I'll keep holding pressure.
You get rid of the visitor.

14:27.603 --> 14:29.070
- Wait.
- What?

14:30.272 --> 14:31.905
Take off your clothes.

14:31.907 --> 14:33.341
What?

14:33.343 --> 14:36.243
You can't go to the door
covered in blood.

14:36.245 --> 14:38.479
Take them off.

14:38.481 --> 14:40.246
- Now.
- I'm not leaving.

14:42.184 --> 14:45.452
Morgan don't make me wait outside.
Open the door.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.740
Can I help you?

15:08.742 --> 15:10.242
Mrs. Sanders?

15:10.244 --> 15:12.543
It's Boyd, is Morgan home?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.778
Ah, no, no, she isn't.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.281
Morgan! Morgan!

15:19.084 --> 15:21.252
I just told you, she's not here.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.187
Try calling her...

15:23.189 --> 15:24.855
- Excuse me!
- I'm not leaving until I speak to her.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.357
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.058
I need to talk to her.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.193
- She won't return any of my calls.
- I'm sorry...

15:35.766 --> 15:37.300
Shut your mouth.

15:38.903 --> 15:43.140
Look, I know your husband and I
got off to a rocky start yesterday.

15:43.142 --> 15:46.475
I'm not a bad guy.
I love your daughter.

15:46.477 --> 15:48.377
You just have to give me a chance.

15:49.379 --> 15:51.647
I understand we're young.

15:51.649 --> 15:54.145
And we didn't plan on this.

15:55.252 --> 15:58.521
But with Morgan being
pregnant and all,

15:58.523 --> 16:00.722
I want to take responsibility.

16:05.327 --> 16:07.162
Are you alright, Mrs. Sanders?
You're bleeding.

16:08.431 --> 16:10.498
I... I was trimming
the bushes out back.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.170
I just, I didn't wear my gloves.

16:13.835 --> 16:15.736
That cut looks like
it needs some attention.

16:15.738 --> 16:17.737
Can I get a bandage for you?

16:17.739 --> 16:20.074
No, no. It's fine.

16:23.546 --> 16:25.479
Shh!

16:25.481 --> 16:28.982
I won't be any trouble, I promise.

16:28.984 --> 16:30.550
Don't move.

16:52.505 --> 16:54.239
Is somebody back there?

16:54.241 --> 16:56.941
- It's just... It's our dog.
- Morgan?

16:58.444 --> 17:00.545
Oh, Boyd. Listen to me.

17:00.547 --> 17:03.248
Thank you for being so honest.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.717
It means a lot. I can see why Morgan
cares so much for you.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.154
She told you about me?

17:10.156 --> 17:11.954
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, she did.

17:13.891 --> 17:18.395
Look, when I was pregnant
with Morgan,

17:18.396 --> 17:22.874
the hormones made me crazy,
just moody and weepy and...

17:22.968 --> 17:25.535
It's normal.
Just give her some time.

17:25.537 --> 17:26.854
She'll call you, she will,

17:26.905 --> 17:28.937
she just needs a bit of space
right now.

17:28.972 --> 17:30.306
Okay, okay, Mrs. Sanders.

17:30.308 --> 17:32.142
- Thank you.
- No problem.

17:32.144 --> 17:34.277
- Tell Morgan...
- I will. I will.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.522
You okay?

17:46.524 --> 17:48.223
Who was at the door?

17:48.225 --> 17:51.092
- Boyd.
- Who's Boyd?

17:51.094 --> 17:53.127
- Don't do that.
- What?

17:53.129 --> 17:55.463
Lie. I know you
talked to him yesterday.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.165
I didn't. I swear.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.433
He told me he came by the house.

18:04.439 --> 18:05.673
It was you.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.976
He thought you were my husband.

19:07.165 --> 19:09.266
Take a break.

19:19.711 --> 19:23.146
You think because you're a beautiful woman
that you're special.

19:23.148 --> 19:25.681
Don't you, Sandrine?

19:25.683 --> 19:27.784
Beautiful women,
they don't have to...

19:29.052 --> 19:30.552
pay their debts.

19:32.188 --> 19:34.656
No. I'll get you your money.

19:34.658 --> 19:38.861
So you've said.
And I believed you.

19:38.863 --> 19:42.765
But I still haven't been paid.

19:42.767 --> 19:44.233
You know what that means?

19:44.235 --> 19:45.666
I'm doing everything I can.

19:45.668 --> 19:47.635
It means you lied to me.

19:48.837 --> 19:51.269
And I don't like to be lied to.

19:54.076 --> 19:57.444
Look, I'm sorry.
I just need a little more time.

19:59.314 --> 20:01.614
We had a business agreement.

20:01.616 --> 20:04.550
I told you, your load was
seized at the border.

20:04.552 --> 20:09.122
Which makes it yours.
You failed to deliver so you bought it.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.258
It won't happen again.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.692
I know.

20:12.694 --> 20:16.829
Please.
Just give me one more chance.

20:47.159 --> 20:49.293
Oh! Sorry.

20:49.295 --> 20:51.228
Sorry. Just give me a sec.

20:57.802 --> 21:00.870
I'm sorry, could you, um...
Could you help me out?

21:03.741 --> 21:07.643
I'm a party planner.
Got this crazy sweet 16 coming up.

21:07.645 --> 21:11.513
Mariachi bands.
Pinatas filled with gift cards.

21:11.515 --> 21:14.216
I was lucky to even get a
cake when I was a teenager.

21:14.818 --> 21:17.086
Thanks so much.

21:17.088 --> 21:18.620
No problem.

21:18.622 --> 21:22.858
That's a really pretty Oriental.
Is it vintage?

21:22.860 --> 21:24.326
It was my grandmother's.

21:24.328 --> 21:28.262
Oh, so you wouldn't be interested
in selling it, would you?

21:32.335 --> 21:34.502
No.

21:34.504 --> 21:37.471
And I'm running a little late, so...

21:38.706 --> 21:40.403
You have a good afternoon.

21:45.947 --> 21:47.481
Yeah, I've got the body.

21:49.317 --> 21:50.550
Okay.

22:07.233 --> 22:10.001
I'm gonna get you some more
antibiotics tomorrow.

22:14.274 --> 22:15.807
Thank you.

22:25.017 --> 22:26.951
Where do you think they are now?

22:26.953 --> 22:31.090
Some place far away. Safe.

22:32.756 --> 22:34.457
Why did you come back?

22:35.793 --> 22:37.693
You could be with them right now.

22:37.695 --> 22:39.329
And you'd be dead.

22:39.331 --> 22:41.131
I was prepared for that.

22:41.133 --> 22:42.598
I know.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.767
You thought if you told me
about Samantha,

22:45.836 --> 22:49.939
you could make me hate you
and I would just go.

22:49.941 --> 22:52.140
Yeah. Yeah.

22:54.311 --> 22:56.832
You hurt me, Brian.

22:59.849 --> 23:03.016
But when he shot you,
I couldn't just walk away.

23:03.128 --> 23:04.783
I had to come home.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.887
You're my husband.

23:08.890 --> 23:10.691
We're a family.

23:11.427 --> 23:12.393
I'm sorry.

23:14.330 --> 23:15.830
I'm so sorry.

23:24.405 --> 23:26.440
- Let's go.
- Hey!

23:26.442 --> 23:28.108
What are you doing?

23:28.110 --> 23:30.444
- I said let's go.
- Ow! You're hurting me!

23:30.446 --> 23:32.139
Leave her alone.

23:32.348 --> 23:34.081
Leave her alone.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.283
- Where are we going?
- You tried to escape.

23:38.952 --> 23:40.552
It's time to pay for that.

23:40.554 --> 23:42.121
No, no, no!

24:00.366 --> 24:01.834
Where's my wife?

24:04.537 --> 24:06.005
Where are your kids?

24:11.410 --> 24:12.510
We're here.

24:14.413 --> 24:15.546
Get out.

24:22.455 --> 24:26.323
Take a look around,
there's nowhere to run.

24:28.627 --> 24:31.028
No one can hear
you scream out here.

24:37.002 --> 24:38.736
Start digging.

24:51.048 --> 24:53.750
Your girlfriend is wondering where you are.
You're gonna have to call her.

24:58.755 --> 25:03.291
Look, my side is killing me.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.460
Could I have something for the pain,
please?

25:08.364 --> 25:10.298
- No.
- Look at me.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.534
I've been shot.

25:13.536 --> 25:15.970
Come on, I'm tied up.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.605
Sometimes life isn't fair.

25:18.607 --> 25:20.274
Is that...

25:22.577 --> 25:24.545
Is that why you're doing this?

25:24.547 --> 25:26.681
Because life isn't fair?

25:26.683 --> 25:29.049
Is it a political thing?

25:29.051 --> 25:30.750
Not exactly.

25:30.752 --> 25:31.951
Then what?

25:35.022 --> 25:37.924
Why are you doing it?

25:37.926 --> 25:41.394
You have children? You married?

25:43.230 --> 25:45.064
I was just trying to protect my family.

25:45.066 --> 25:47.966
You'd do the same thing,
if you were in my shoes.

25:49.502 --> 25:51.403
Maybe. But I'm not.

25:51.405 --> 25:54.472
Please,
I just need something for the pain.

25:57.310 --> 26:00.778
I'll get us some sandwiches,
water, chips.

26:00.780 --> 26:01.913
I want to go home.

26:02.816 --> 26:04.782
Jake, we've been through this already.

26:05.919 --> 26:09.020
You know what, you want to live
with the friggin' Mounties, be my guest.

26:09.022 --> 26:10.321
But I am getting a ticket home.

26:10.323 --> 26:11.789
You're my responsibility now!

26:11.791 --> 26:13.124
So you have to do what I say!

26:13.126 --> 26:14.959
Dream on.

26:14.961 --> 26:17.127
What do you think
you're gonna find at home?

26:17.129 --> 26:18.895
Mom and Dad!

26:18.897 --> 26:20.931
We escaped.
Mom and Dad didn't.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.034
Jake! They could be dead!

26:26.738 --> 26:28.739
I'm sorry.

26:28.741 --> 26:30.741
You are not in charge of me.

26:32.676 --> 26:33.675
Fine.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.645
Suit yourself.

26:55.731 --> 26:57.331
It's the best I can do.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.467
You didn't bring a glass for yourself?

26:59.469 --> 27:00.668
Not thirsty.

27:07.075 --> 27:08.408
How long you been sober?

27:10.779 --> 27:12.880
Takes a lot of guts
to stay on the wagon.

27:14.149 --> 27:17.717
That kind of strength,
it's very admirable.

27:20.788 --> 27:23.156
Yeah.

27:23.158 --> 27:25.424
A guy like you,
you're better than the others.

27:26.526 --> 27:28.227
You don't belong in this mess.

27:30.197 --> 27:31.730
Drink your drink.

27:31.732 --> 27:34.533
Please. Just call the cops.

27:34.535 --> 27:36.868
You want to do the right thing,
I know you do.

27:36.870 --> 27:38.336
- Stop playing me.
- I'm not.

27:38.338 --> 27:39.737
You don't know a damn thing
about me.

27:39.739 --> 27:41.572
You don't even know the first thing
about your own family.

27:41.574 --> 27:43.574
Look at your kids.
Open your eyes.

27:43.576 --> 27:45.310
Your son, he's dealing weed.

27:45.312 --> 27:48.044
That's why he got his ass kicked.

27:53.084 --> 27:54.984
You've reached the Sanders residence.

27:55.023 --> 27:56.893
Please leave a message.

27:58.056 --> 28:02.293
Mom, Dad, it's me.

28:03.728 --> 28:05.395
Morgan said...

28:07.498 --> 28:10.033
I just really wanted to talk to you,

28:10.035 --> 28:14.871
- make sure you're okay.
- Please. Let me talk to him!

28:14.873 --> 28:16.795
I should've stayed.

28:16.868 --> 28:20.880
Morgan made me leave,
that was a mistake.

28:21.112 --> 28:22.611
I'm really sorry.

28:23.881 --> 28:26.481
Hey, Jake. Where are you?

28:28.384 --> 28:30.252
I want to talk to my parents.

28:32.521 --> 28:34.922
Gonna have to come home
for that, kid.

28:34.924 --> 28:36.623
Are they still alive?

28:36.625 --> 28:39.460
Of course.
I was just talking to your dad.

28:41.730 --> 28:43.564
Jake? You still there?

28:46.801 --> 28:48.269
You're lying to me.

28:48.271 --> 28:50.603
Come on, man, that's not true.
You can trust me.

29:02.483 --> 29:03.884
Don't even think about it.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.371
What?

29:06.410 --> 29:07.810
You were going to call home,
weren't you?

29:07.821 --> 29:10.022
No. I wasn't.

29:10.024 --> 29:12.524
Okay, well, we have to go.

29:12.526 --> 29:13.792
You coming?

30:00.904 --> 30:02.860
- Yeah?
- Where have you been?

30:02.899 --> 30:03.957
What?

30:03.988 --> 30:05.753
I left you half a dozen messages.
Didn't you get them?

30:05.788 --> 30:08.911
Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I was just
following up on some leads.

30:08.913 --> 30:10.778
I found the kids.

30:10.780 --> 30:12.447
How?

30:12.449 --> 30:13.915
The son Jake called.
I traced it to a payphone

30:13.917 --> 30:15.450
at a rest stop in Pikesville.

30:15.452 --> 30:16.451
Got it.

30:30.198 --> 30:31.565
You don't have to do this.

30:35.036 --> 30:38.973
You bury me,
then you can't kill the President.

30:38.975 --> 30:40.274
You need me.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.243
There's always a back-up plan.

30:44.245 --> 30:48.081
I... I'm sorry that we...

30:49.683 --> 30:52.986
Morgan and Jake are kids.

30:52.988 --> 30:55.788
They don't deserve this.
We told them to run!

30:55.790 --> 30:56.989
Mmm-hmm.

30:59.993 --> 31:02.760
Full moon.
I read somewhere that

31:02.762 --> 31:06.398
emergency room visits
skyrocket during full moons.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.434
I heard this story once
about this resident doing

31:09.436 --> 31:11.703
an E.R. rotation
on a night like this.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.492
It's a crazy shift.

31:15.566 --> 31:20.212
Stabbings, gunshot wounds,
car crashes...

31:23.348 --> 31:24.715
And a girl...

31:26.718 --> 31:30.020
beaten so badly,
her jaw was broken.

31:32.689 --> 31:34.424
She had been raped.

31:35.626 --> 31:37.760
Nineteen years old.

31:37.762 --> 31:41.331
She met a guy at a party,
seemed nice enough...

31:41.333 --> 31:43.199
Until he wasn't.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.100
But she fought back hard.

31:45.102 --> 31:47.742
Hard enough that the cops
had to take him to the E.R.

31:47.777 --> 31:49.815
before they booked him.

31:49.850 --> 31:54.443
What happened next
is a little unclear.

31:54.445 --> 31:57.446
It seems the rapist somehow broke free.

31:58.881 --> 32:00.682
Went after the resident.

32:00.684 --> 32:02.583
So she grabbed a scalpel

32:06.721 --> 32:08.456
and she killed him.

32:12.094 --> 32:13.827
That's not.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.031
what happened.

32:17.033 --> 32:18.498
The cops were in the hall.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.501
All you had to do was open
the door and yell for help.

32:21.503 --> 32:23.036
You watched him bleed to death.

32:23.038 --> 32:26.639
You chose to let him die.

32:26.641 --> 32:28.241
No.

32:28.243 --> 32:32.479
After what he did to that helpless,
innocent girl, who could blame you?

32:33.680 --> 32:35.714
You wanted him to pay.

32:35.716 --> 32:37.583
Say it, Ellen.

32:37.585 --> 32:39.485
He deserved to die...

32:40.653 --> 32:42.254
didn't he?

32:42.256 --> 32:43.255
Say it!

32:45.092 --> 32:48.026
Yes. Yeah.

32:49.261 --> 32:51.229
And so does the President.

32:51.231 --> 32:52.464
What?

32:54.433 --> 32:57.234
That's why we chose you
for this project.

33:00.072 --> 33:02.773
We needed a killer.

33:02.775 --> 33:05.142
Someone who could
actually take a life.

33:14.919 --> 33:16.920
You've dug deep enough.

33:29.986 --> 33:31.085
Kneel down.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.896
No, please don't do this.

33:43.465 --> 33:45.031
Close your eyes.

33:49.337 --> 33:52.672
Please don't do this.

34:07.220 --> 34:10.389
For God's sake, just get it over with!

34:16.362 --> 34:18.462
Oh! Oh, please.

34:19.731 --> 34:21.799
You sick bastard!

34:21.801 --> 34:23.534
Bury her.

34:25.036 --> 34:27.538
You heard me. I said bury her.

34:56.166 --> 34:59.467
You can torture me
as much as you want.

35:00.804 --> 35:02.738
It doesn't matter.

35:04.808 --> 35:06.909
'Cause my kids got away.

35:08.545 --> 35:10.212
They're safe.

35:12.915 --> 35:14.415
So...

35:18.186 --> 35:20.054
I win.

35:36.771 --> 35:38.204
I win.

35:40.576 --> 35:42.642
Oh.

35:42.644 --> 35:45.911
It's okay.
We're going to be okay.

35:51.585 --> 35:53.352
I love you.

35:55.655 --> 35:56.655
I'm so scared.

35:59.292 --> 36:01.526
The girlfriend's been texting him
all night.

36:01.528 --> 36:03.594
What do you wanna do?

36:12.838 --> 36:13.972
- Hey.
- Ow.

36:13.974 --> 36:14.973
Careful.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.344
What happened?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.267
Ask her.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.173
Your boyfriend came by again.

36:29.487 --> 36:34.524
Get rid of him. For good.
Or I will.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.660
Okay... Please don't hurt him.

36:37.662 --> 36:40.255
Do it tonight and I won't have to.

36:48.871 --> 36:50.572
Take it easy with the kids, huh?

36:50.574 --> 36:52.373
There's no reason to rough 'em up,
you hear me?

36:52.375 --> 36:55.009
The idea was to get them back, right?

36:58.814 --> 37:03.018
I want fifty thousand dollars by tomorrow.
That's my number.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.252
I'm not gonna negotiate.

37:31.845 --> 37:34.013
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:35.315 --> 37:37.248
You should see the other guy.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.983
What happened?

37:41.588 --> 37:43.288
Got it, none of my business.

37:44.657 --> 37:46.524
Money problems.

37:46.526 --> 37:48.192
Sorry.

37:49.261 --> 37:51.296
Anything I can do?

37:51.298 --> 37:52.297
No.

37:56.201 --> 37:58.368
But thanks for asking.

38:22.459 --> 38:24.727
I'm so glad you finally called.

38:33.202 --> 38:35.804
I'm gonna take care of you, okay?

38:35.806 --> 38:39.698
It's not gonna work out with us, Boyd.
We have to break up.

38:40.909 --> 38:42.709
I don't love you.

38:45.981 --> 38:48.215
You don't mean that.

38:48.217 --> 38:49.850
I do.

38:52.921 --> 38:55.823
I could never marry
someone like you.

38:58.092 --> 39:00.861
You're just not...

39:00.863 --> 39:03.530
What? Hmm?

39:05.566 --> 39:07.366
Good enough?

39:08.602 --> 39:10.336
Yes.

39:30.991 --> 39:33.591
Hey, Samantha. It's Brian.

39:33.593 --> 39:35.894
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.

39:37.362 --> 39:39.964
I, uh, was in a car accident.

39:39.966 --> 39:43.167
Nothing serious, but I'm
gonna be out for a few days.

39:44.403 --> 39:46.136
Uh, um, I'm not in Canada.

39:46.138 --> 39:47.771
I'll explain it all later,

39:47.773 --> 39:50.507
I just... Just don't worry
about me, all right?

39:51.576 --> 39:53.700
I miss you.

39:56.181 --> 39:57.927
And, uh...

39:58.616 --> 40:01.132
I love you.

40:12.629 --> 40:15.631
Nice job, Romeo,
that was word for word.

40:33.949 --> 40:35.616
Hold it right there.

40:35.618 --> 40:37.852
Keep your hands where
I can see 'em!

40:37.854 --> 40:39.854
- What's going on?
- Hands!

40:39.856 --> 40:41.122
What's going on?

40:48.630 --> 40:50.697
We got weapons.

40:50.699 --> 40:53.467
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

40:53.469 --> 40:56.436
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

40:56.438 --> 40:58.171
Get him out of here.

41:12.152 --> 41:15.020
- Yeah.
- We found your guy.

41:15.022 --> 41:16.455
Good.

41:16.457 --> 41:18.791
Yeah, the guns were in the trunk.
Hell of a load, too.

41:18.793 --> 41:22.042
- Glad it worked out.
- Thanks for the tip.
