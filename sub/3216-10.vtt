He hasn't been home in a few days.

DEAN: This was Dad's book. I think he
wants us to pick up where he left off.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.399
Saving people. Hunting things.
The family business.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.276
You think Mom would have
wanted this for us?

-I forgot you're not local.

-You don't know the legend.
-Legend?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.251
Every town's got its stories, right?

01:24.460 --> 01:26.670
Ours is Roosevelt Asylum.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.298
They say it's haunted
with the ghosts of the patients.

01:29.507 --> 01:32.384

the spirits will drive you insane.

-In there.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.064

So, what?

04:33.857 --> 04:35.442
You're still not talking to me?

04:38.487 --> 04:41.031
Walt, I said
I was sorry about before.

SAM: No, Dad was in California
last we heard from him.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.393
We just thought that he comes
to you for munitions...

05:09.476 --> 05:11.645
...maybe you seen him
in the last few weeks.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.314
-Call us if you hear anything, thanks.
MAN (ON PHONE): Okay.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.525
-You bet.
-Caleb hasn't heard from him?

05:16.608 --> 05:19.903
Nope.
Neither has Jefferson or Pastor Jim.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.989
What about the journal?
Any leads in there?

05:22.239 --> 05:25.534
No. Same last time I looked.
Nothing I can make out.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.412
I love the guy,
but he writes like Yoda.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.206
Maybe we should call the feds.
File a missing persons.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.126
We talked about this. Dad would be
pissed if we put the feds on him.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.378
I don't care. After all
that happened back in Kansas....

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

05:37.880 --> 05:38.922
He should've been there.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.175
You said so yourself.
You tried to call him.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.509
I know.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.721
-Where the hell is my cell phone?
-You know, he could be dead.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.265
Don't say that. He's not dead.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.518
-He's-- He's--
-He's what? He's hiding? He's busy?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.401
I don't believe it.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.487
What?

06:04.531 --> 06:07.284
It's a-- A text message.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.786
It's coordinates.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.498
SAM:
You think Dad was texting us?

06:12.706 --> 06:16.335
-He's given us coordinates before.
-He can barely work a toaster, Dean.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.546
Sam, this is good news.
It means he's okay. Or alive, at least.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.673
Was there a number on the caller ID?

06:21.757 --> 06:24.593
-No, it said unknown.
-Where do the coordinates point?

06:24.676 --> 06:27.554
That's the interesting part.
Rockford, Illinois.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.598
Okay, and that's interesting how?

06:29.681 --> 06:32.768
I checked the local Rockford paper.
Take a look at this.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.440
This cop, Walter Kelly, he comes home
from his shift, shoots his wife...

06:38.732 --> 06:41.568
...then puts the gun in his mouth,
blows his brains out.

06:41.652 --> 06:45.656
Earlier that night, Kelly and his partner
responded to a call at Roosevelt Asylum.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.534
Okay, I'm not following.
What does this have to do with us?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.995
Dad earmarked the same asylum
in the journal.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.580
Let's see.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.084
Here. Seven unconfirmed sightings.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.837
Two deaths. Till last week, at least.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.464
I think this is where
he wants us to go.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.469
SAM:
This is a job.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.640
-Dad wants us to work a job.
-Yeah, maybe we'll meet up with him.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.810
He could be sending us there
by ourselves to hunt this thing.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.981
Who cares? If he wants us there,
it's good enough for me.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.483
This doesn't strike you as weird?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.486
-The texting? The coordinates?
-Sam.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.614

08:00.397 --> 08:02.816
It won't take that long.
I just wanna hear your story.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.486
A week ago my partner was sitting
in that chair. Now he's dead.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.823
-You gonna ambush me here?
-Sorry. I need to know what happened.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.743
Hey, buddy. How about
leaving the guy alone, huh?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.662
The man's an officer.
Why don't you show a little respect.

08:22.628 --> 08:25.714
-You didn't have to do that.
-Yeah, of course I did.

08:25.923 --> 08:29.635
That guy's a serious jerk.
Let me buy you a beer, huh?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.970
Two.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.266
Thanks.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.941
-You shoved me kind of hard in there.
-I had to sell it, didn't I?

-Huh?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.947
-Never mind.
-What'd you find out from Gunderson?

-He had a bright future ahead of him.
-What about at home?

08:56.078 --> 08:59.331
He and his wife had a few fights,
but it was mostly smooth sailing.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.791
They were talking
about having kids.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.210
So either Kelly had some
crazy waiting to bust out...

09:03.460 --> 09:04.670
-...or something did it to him.
-Right.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.589
What'd Gunderson
tell you about the asylum?

09:07.673 --> 09:09.675
A lot.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.410
So apparently,
the cops chased the kids here...

09:37.744 --> 09:39.746
...into the south wing.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.375
DEAN:
South wing, huh?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.711
Wait a second.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.630
South wing, south wing.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.386

the south wing.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.013
Only one survived."

09:56.221 --> 10:00.225
Way he tells it, one of his friends went
nuts and started lighting up the place.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.854
So whatever's going on,
south wing seems like the heart of it.

10:04.062 --> 10:07.941
But if kids are spelunking the asylum,
why aren't there a ton more deaths?

10:09.026 --> 10:11.778

10:11.987 --> 10:13.780

10:35.302 --> 10:37.596
Ghosts are attracted to that
ESP thing you got.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.891
I told you, it's not ESP.
I just have strange vibes sometimes.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.643

-Yeah, whatever. Don't ask, don't tell.

Ghosts are possessing people?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.744
Maybe.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.665

-Oh, let's see. Never.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.143
-I'm being serious, man.
-So am I, Sam. He sent us here.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.604
He obviously wants us here.
We'll pick up the search later.

This is our family.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.118
I understand that, Sam.
But he's given us an order.

I'll tell you all about
the Roosevelt riot...

15:03.653 --> 15:06.281
...if you tell me something
honest about yourself.

you're road-tripping with.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.079
How do you feel about him?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.968
Dude. You were in there forever.
What the hell were you talking about?

15:27.218 --> 15:29.012
-Just the hospital, you know?
-And?

15:29.095 --> 15:32.182
And the south wing? It's where
they housed the real hard cases.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.893
-The psychotics, the criminally insane.
-Sounds cozy.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.103
Yeah. And one night in '64,
they rioted.

15:37.312 --> 15:41.149
-Attacked staff, attacked each other.
-So the patients took over the asylum?

15:41.232 --> 15:42.901
-Apparently.
-Any deaths?

15:42.984 --> 15:46.112
Some patients, some staff.
I guess it was pretty gory.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.448
Some of the bodies
were never even recovered...

15:48.531 --> 15:51.409
-...including our chief of staff, Ellicott.
-Never recovered?

15:51.618 --> 15:55.413
Cops scoured every inch of the place,
but I guess the patients must've...

15:55.622 --> 15:58.166
...stuffed the bodies
somewhere hidden.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.626
-That's grim.
-Yeah.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.630
So they transferred all the surviving
patients and shut down the hospital.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.257
So we've got violent deaths

be fun and try and see some ghosts.

He thought if he could get his patients
to vent their anger, they'd be cured of it.

Instead, it only made them worse
and worse, and angrier and angrier.

is doing the same thing? To the cop.

so angry, they become homicidal.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.404
We're no closer to finding Dad today
than we were six months ago.

37:20.530 --> 37:24.284
Well, then here.
Let me make it easier for you.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.121
DEAN:
Come on. Take it.

37:28.538 --> 37:32.459
Real bullets are gonna work a hell
of a lot better than rock salt.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.586
Take it!

37:45.347 --> 37:46.515
You hate me that much?

37:48.475 --> 37:51.311
You think you could kill
your own brother?

37:53.146 --> 37:55.190
Then go ahead.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.068
Pull the trigger.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.282
Do it!

38:22.092 --> 38:24.302
Man, I'm not gonna
give you a loaded pistol.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.895
Sorry, Sammy.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.293
Oh, that's just gross.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.304
Yeah, soak it up.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.611
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to help you.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.655
I'm going to make you all better.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.500
You're not gonna
try to kill me, are you?

41:02.669 --> 41:04.087
No.

41:04.296 --> 41:05.714
Good.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.758
Because that would be awkward.

41:14.556 --> 41:17.684
-Thanks, guys.
-Yeah, thanks.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.645
No more haunted asylums, okay?

41:26.943 --> 41:29.487
Hey, Dean.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.698
I'm sorry, man.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.492
I said some awful things back there.

41:34.701 --> 41:38.079
-You remember all that?
-Yeah.

41:39.080 --> 41:43.168
It's like I couldn't control it.
But I didn't mean it, any of it.

41:43.919 --> 41:47.088
-You didn't, huh?
-No, of course not.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.302
Do we need to talk about this?

41:52.510 --> 41:56.556
No. I'm not really in
the sharing-and-caring kind of mood.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.267
I just wanna get some sleep.
