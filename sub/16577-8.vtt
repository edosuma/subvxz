01:46.608 --> 01:48.541
Damn, I can't find the sex tape.

Do you think it was
a "You're a cool guy,

06:56.754 --> 06:58.854
and I'd love to kick it
after school" type of "hey,"

06:58.856 --> 07:01.790
or more of a "Damn, Grover,
I want to high-five your dick

07:01.792 --> 07:03.225

07:03.227 --> 07:04.826

unless you got some hot sauce.

10:00.003 --> 10:01.269
You know what?
Fuck that.

10:01.271 --> 10:04.239

Oh, shit, he changed it,
just like a bitch-ass white boy.

10:28.232 --> 10:30.832
- Now what?
- Hurry, I'm about to crash.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.367
That's what your greedy ass get.

10:32.369 --> 10:34.202
Hey, y'all, keep a cool booty.

10:34.204 --> 10:35.937
Duke, go get bitch-ass Uncle Joey

10:35.939 --> 10:38.006
and tell him we need the code
to the panic room.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.709
Oh, and before you leave,
tell him eat a dick.

10:42.746 --> 10:45.580
- We need a landline, my nigs.
- The hell is that?

10:45.582 --> 10:48.850
It's a sort of communication that
old nigs used to talk to each other.

10:48.852 --> 10:51.887
We just need to find a old person.
I'm sure they'll have one.

10:51.889 --> 10:53.922
Oh, I know.
Old-ass Miss Jenkins.

10:53.924 --> 10:56.992
Hopefully she got some pie
chilling on the windowsill.

10:56.994 --> 10:59.094
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:59.096 --> 11:00.128
Let's gear up.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.600
Jamal, come on.

11:13.410 --> 11:14.476
Almost there.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.816
- Ooh, shit, it's Kobe Bryant.
- Help me...

11:21.818 --> 11:24.185
Just pass me the trophies,
and we'll pull you out.

11:24.187 --> 11:25.220
Pass?

11:28.091 --> 11:29.925
These was Shaq's anyway.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.896
I don't think anybody's home.

11:34.898 --> 11:37.866
- What the hell are you doing, Milk?
- Being a G.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.100
The world's ending, my dudes,

11:39.102 --> 11:41.870
and we ain't going out
like no punks. Shamon.

11:44.474 --> 11:47.976
Oh, look at this bitch photo album.
She older than wood.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.445
<i>Damn, Ms. Jenkins was
the original jump-off.</i>

11:50.447 --> 11:52.948
<i>Ken Griffey Juniors,
Magic Johnsons,</i>

11:52.950 --> 11:55.884
Shawn Kemps,
Martin Luther King Seniors?

11:55.886 --> 11:59.120
Man, check these out.
Miss Jenkins is packin' in the backin'.

11:59.122 --> 12:02.857
<i>- Booty for weeks.
- Oh, hell, yeah... teeth in the jar.</i>

12:02.859 --> 12:04.626
You know she give
them good gummies.

12:05.829 --> 12:07.128
Uhh! Come on, can!

12:07.130 --> 12:08.196
Uhh!

12:08.198 --> 12:09.597
Can't get this shit open.
Uhh!

12:09.599 --> 12:11.666
Jamal, no!

12:12.836 --> 12:18.506
- I'm a legend, bitch.
- You idiot, you broke the landline.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.442
Y'all want some pork and beans?

12:20.444 --> 12:23.606
You go raw in that too?
Nasty motherfucker.

12:24.114 --> 12:25.380
Oh, shit.

12:26.193 --> 12:28.033
- Oh, shit!
- Hands up, don't shoot!

12:28.035 --> 12:29.434
Get the fuck out.

12:29.436 --> 12:32.204
Wait, just the white boy.

12:32.206 --> 12:37.475
- You two dark ones can stay.
- Aight, let's dip, y'all.

12:37.477 --> 12:41.479
Mmm, cocoa butter.
That takes me back.

12:44.451 --> 12:46.151
Aw, hell, no!

12:46.153 --> 12:49.187
- And barrel roll.
- Hands up, assholes.

12:49.189 --> 12:52.891
- Not you, Milton. You're fine.
- Don't worry, fellas. I got this.

12:52.893 --> 12:54.893
What are you boys doing
in this neighborhood, huh?

12:54.895 --> 12:56.328
Wouldn't be looting, would you?

12:56.330 --> 12:57.529
<i>Nice!</i>

12:59.499 --> 13:02.200
- Sir, we were just...
- Hey, did I tell you to talk?!

13:02.202 --> 13:04.769
You might want to watch that lip, son.
It sounds aggressive,

13:04.771 --> 13:06.905
and I'm starting to fear
for my life right now.

13:06.907 --> 13:10.108
You only stopped us 'cause
we black, you dirty-ass pigs.

13:10.110 --> 13:13.078
- I got it all on tape.
- Look, guns!

13:13.080 --> 13:14.412
<i>Get over here!</i>

13:14.414 --> 13:16.915
<i>No, no, not my Taser.
This doesn't feel good.</i>

13:16.917 --> 13:19.517
<i>No, no, the other shoe has dropped.</i>

13:19.519 --> 13:21.953
- Worldstar!
- Come on, Milk.

13:26.426 --> 13:28.193
This is all I have.

13:28.195 --> 13:30.996
I just need a few minutes
to order some diapers.

13:30.998 --> 13:33.465
The market is all out
because of the looting.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, likely story.

13:35.402 --> 13:36.935
Let me tell you what's
really happening.

13:36.937 --> 13:38.603
You're jonesing for some
"Housewives of Atlanta,"

13:38.605 --> 13:40.071
and it's making you crazy.

13:40.073 --> 13:42.007
No, seriously,
my baby keeps shitting.

13:42.009 --> 13:44.576
Come on, ese, move it!
Time's up.

13:44.578 --> 13:47.212
I had to reset my password.
I'm so sorry.

13:47.214 --> 13:48.980
It will just be another moment.

13:52.019 --> 13:54.786
<i>You think it's a pudding pop,
but it's not.</i>

13:54.788 --> 13:56.388
<i>You still put it
in your mouth, though.</i>

13:56.390 --> 13:58.023
<i>Zippity bop pow!</i>

13:58.025 --> 13:59.557
Pete, what is this?

13:59.559 --> 14:02.794
Hey, cash rules everything
around me. You know the rest.

14:02.796 --> 14:04.763
You disloyal mother...
man, that's it.

14:04.765 --> 14:06.264
No more Internet for anybody.

14:06.266 --> 14:08.333
I want everybody up
out of here right now.

14:10.871 --> 14:14.172
Not you.
We came up in this game together.

14:14.174 --> 14:16.207
You don't have to do this!

14:16.209 --> 14:18.310
I didn't do this.
You did.

14:18.312 --> 14:21.479
Please, Malik, not in the face!
I want a open casket.

14:21.481 --> 14:25.450
You really sadden me, Pete.
Am I my brother's keeper?

14:25.652 --> 14:28.753
Am I... my brother's... keeper?

14:28.755 --> 14:29.988
Yes, I am!

14:31.024 --> 14:34.192
- Sorry, Pete.
- Uh, can I go now?

14:34.194 --> 14:35.627
Man, get out of here.

14:38.332 --> 14:40.865
Don't feel bad.
You had to do it.

14:43.704 --> 14:45.870
Way to go, dickheads.
You know what?

14:45.872 --> 14:48.573
Me and Rhiyonce would have been
better off without y'all.

14:48.575 --> 14:50.241
"Y'all"?
What you mean, y'all?

14:50.243 --> 14:52.143
Jamal's the one that
messed everything up.

14:52.145 --> 14:55.780
- Me? I'm the one that found the phone!
- You also broke it.

14:55.782 --> 14:57.983
Man, we in some
Book of Rebalations-type shit,

14:57.985 --> 15:01.052
and y'all standing here
arguing about swine and beans

15:01.054 --> 15:03.822
and phones, and Rhiyonce
laying up there damaged goods.

15:03.824 --> 15:06.825
- I can't even look at her no more.
- You know what?

15:06.827 --> 15:09.461
You've become a real liability
on these streets, my nig.

15:09.463 --> 15:11.496
Well, you been acting
like a little biyatch

15:11.498 --> 15:13.365
ever since that text from Cindy.

15:13.367 --> 15:15.600
Might want to change
your tampon, ho!

15:15.602 --> 15:17.068
Who you calling ho, ho?

15:17.070 --> 15:18.636
You so hard, come get some.

15:23.443 --> 15:25.543
You just jealous that you would
never have a chance

15:25.545 --> 15:27.645
with a girl like Cindy.

15:27.647 --> 15:29.247
I don't even know why
I kick it with you.

15:29.249 --> 15:31.780
Oh, it's like that, huh?

15:31.850 --> 15:36.496
Well, I think it's about time
you learn the truth.

15:37.762 --> 15:42.631
Hey, look! A new kid got
a butthole inside of his brain.

15:42.632 --> 15:45.200
Let's call him Butthole Brains.

15:45.202 --> 15:47.069
Man, he got a hole
in the side of his brain

15:47.071 --> 15:49.805
and a brain inside his head
inside of his hole.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.207
Nice shoes, buster.
Where you get those,

15:52.209 --> 15:55.541
Payless or Can't Pay No Less?

16:00.718 --> 16:02.451
Jamal, listen, buddy.

16:02.453 --> 16:04.820
Grover's new here,
and he's having a hard time

16:04.822 --> 16:08.190
making friends, and as you can
tell by his shoes...

16:08.192 --> 16:09.625
He broke as shit?

16:09.627 --> 16:10.926
That wasn't what I was
going to say,

16:10.928 --> 16:12.327
but, yes, he is broke as shit.

16:12.329 --> 16:14.963
So would you do me a favor
and play with him?

16:14.965 --> 16:17.366
I'll give you a free lunch ticket.

16:17.368 --> 16:20.235
Make it two free lunch tickets,
and you got a deal.

16:21.672 --> 16:24.674
The moral of the story is,
fish sticks and coffee cake

16:24.675 --> 16:27.609
is the only reason
you got a friend right now...

16:27.611 --> 16:30.145
fish sticks and coffee cake.

16:30.447 --> 16:34.049
Fish sticks and coffee cake!

16:34.051 --> 16:36.818
Ooh!

16:36.820 --> 16:39.054
Look, baby, I ain't saying
it was your fault,

16:39.056 --> 16:40.956
but I should take the air out
you right now.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.025
But I can't,
'cause I love you too much.

16:43.027 --> 16:47.162
I just need to know one thing.
Was he bigger than me?

16:47.164 --> 16:48.730
I knew he couldn't match my nine.

16:48.732 --> 16:51.266
Now let's clean these holes
and get it cracking.

16:56.073 --> 16:57.506
I thought I could
help people transform

16:57.508 --> 16:59.308
from the brainwashed drones
they'd become

16:59.310 --> 17:01.443
into real, free-thinking
humans again.

17:01.445 --> 17:03.645
But having all that power
is too much for one man.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.781
It corrupted me...
made me less than human.

17:05.782 --> 17:10.252
Bottom line,
it turned me into a... cracker.

17:10.253 --> 17:11.653
<i>Give me that Internet, boy!</i>

17:11.655 --> 17:13.255
<i>We know you're in there!</i>

17:13.257 --> 17:14.323
I got to get out of here.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.757
<i>He's getting away!</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:22.330
- There he is!
- Uh-oh.

17:31.237 --> 17:34.138
- What they want, Malik?
- The Internet, man.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.940
I got it on lock.
I don't even want it anymore.

17:36.942 --> 17:39.243
- Can you help me find Cindy?
- I-Is she lost?

17:39.245 --> 17:42.279
Nah, Grover just think she
want to get busy, but she don't.

17:42.281 --> 17:46.250
I'll suck your dick, little man.
I'll suck it real hard.

17:46.252 --> 17:48.786
No!
I don't want them to do that.

17:50.289 --> 17:52.322
I'll help you find your girl
if you promise to keep me safe

17:52.324 --> 17:53.824
and let me sleep
in your room tonight.

17:53.826 --> 17:55.392
Oh, shit!

17:55.394 --> 17:57.795
Run, fellas!

17:57.797 --> 18:01.532
I'll can use Cindy's cell phone number
to triangulate her position.

18:01.534 --> 18:04.067
Boom, got eem.

18:04.069 --> 18:06.403
Moment of truth, y'all.

18:06.405 --> 18:09.206
Hell, yeah. It's back.

18:17.216 --> 18:19.801
- Hey, Grover, what's up?
- Hey, Cindy, just, uh,

18:19.802 --> 18:22.252
wanted to check in
and see if you was okay.

18:22.254 --> 18:25.455
- The Internet's been down.
- Oh, I been, uh,

18:25.457 --> 18:27.524
tied up for the last 20 minutes.

18:27.526 --> 18:30.794
<i>Cindy Louise Scrilla,
did you drop a beefy deuce</i>

18:30.796 --> 18:32.329
<i>in the guest bathroom again?</i>

18:32.331 --> 18:34.482
- Dad!
- It took me three flushes

18:34.483 --> 18:36.233
<i>and a coat hanger
to get it down!</i>

18:36.235 --> 18:38.319
- Okay!
- I'm just saying,

18:38.320 --> 18:40.571
<i>the next time we go
to Boston Market,</i>

18:40.573 --> 18:42.906
<i>you are not getting the meatloaf!</i>

18:43.943 --> 18:47.277
- So what's up, guys?
- What's good with that text?

18:47.279 --> 18:49.947
- I never texted you.
- Boo, stop frontin'.

18:49.949 --> 18:54.885
- Uh, oh... Uh, okay.
- I'm so stupid.

18:54.887 --> 18:57.588
I meant to text Grandma,
not Grover.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.356
I must have fat-fingered it.
Whoops.

18:59.358 --> 19:01.391
Cool, yeah, makes sense.

19:01.393 --> 19:03.193
Uh, we got to go now.
I'll holler.

19:03.195 --> 19:06.563
<i>Lord knows the girl
needs to eat more greens.</i>

19:06.565 --> 19:09.299
<i>Her insides is rotten!
Lord, they rotten.</i>

19:09.301 --> 19:11.034
Smell you later, Cindy.

19:11.036 --> 19:12.870
You better hope she don't
wipe back to front.

19:17.509 --> 19:21.144
And that, my niggas,
is how you stack your bread,

19:21.146 --> 19:24.548
be a good role model,
and become one with the universe

19:24.550 --> 19:26.717
to achieve peace on Earth and shit.

19:26.719 --> 19:28.318
I killed that shit!

19:32.391 --> 19:37.160
Oh, shit, we back up, nigga!

19:37.162 --> 19:39.730
Who want to get they ass
blowed up?

19:39.732 --> 19:42.023
Take that, nig!

19:43.235 --> 19:45.369
Hey, man, sorry about Cindy.

19:45.371 --> 19:47.337
Real talk: I may have
hung out with you

19:47.339 --> 19:49.072
for the fish sticks
in the beginning,

19:49.074 --> 19:51.341
but then I realized
you were my nig.

19:51.343 --> 19:53.710
Shit, man, you even taught me
how to pump fake.

19:53.712 --> 19:54.845
'Preciate you, bruh.

19:54.847 --> 19:57.814
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be Butthole Brains.

19:57.816 --> 19:59.216
This headband you gave me
back in the day

19:59.218 --> 20:03.020
- changed everything, my nig.
- Ooh, that shit got worse!

20:03.022 --> 20:05.088
Y'all probably tight with me
'cause I'm always on time

20:05.090 --> 20:07.557
with the comedy, right?
Or is it the stories?

20:07.559 --> 20:09.559
Y'all know I got them
stories on deck.

20:09.561 --> 20:11.895
Honestly, bruh, I just like
the fact that you rich.

20:11.897 --> 20:13.530
I just love your mom's titties.

20:14.833 --> 20:17.000
<i> At the end of the day,
Yeezus was right.</i>

20:17.002 --> 20:18.468
<i>We're all slaves,</i>

20:18.470 --> 20:21.071
<i>especially when it comes
to this digital madness.</i>

20:21.073 --> 20:23.540
<i>This powerful tool that
should be connecting the world</i>

20:23.542 --> 20:27.210
<i>has made us more disconnected
than any time in history.</i>

20:27.212 --> 20:28.512
<i>In a world where real emotions</i>

20:28.514 --> 20:30.113
<i>have been replaced by emoticons,</i>

20:30.115 --> 20:32.649
<i>who will teach the next
generation to love?</i>

20:32.651 --> 20:34.084
Yo, I got the tape.

20:34.086 --> 20:36.853
<i>Hoagie!
Come and take the hoagie!</i>

20:38.123 --> 20:40.023
Damn, that's a ashy dick.

20:40.025 --> 20:44.097
Yeah, look like he been smashing
chalkboard erasers.
