(male narrator)
Long, long ago
deep in the forest

00:08.130 --> 00:12.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.089 --> 00:17.019
They called themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

00:17.039 --> 00:19.199
[music continues]

00:22.160 --> 00:26.160
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.179 --> 00:28.019
He was bad.

00:28.039 --> 00:30.079
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.170 --> 00:34.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.039 --> 00:36.130
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.149 --> 00:38.149
[evil laughter]

00:38.170 --> 00:39.179
Oh!

00:39.200 --> 00:41.109
Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.130 --> 00:44.170
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

00:44.189 --> 00:47.060
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.079 --> 00:51.090
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.109 --> 00:53.189
And if you are good,
you may just

00:53.210 --> 00:57.009
catch a glimpse...
of the Smurfs.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.019
(Papa Smurf)
'Ahem.'

01:23.099 --> 01:25.090
Eat hardy, my Smurfs.

01:25.109 --> 01:27.069
Won't you join us,
Papa Smurf?

01:27.090 --> 01:30.109
No, Smurfette,
I need some rare wrinkle root

01:30.129 --> 01:33.090
which only grows on the far
side of the mountains.

01:33.109 --> 01:35.200
But I shall return
in a few smurfs.

01:35.219 --> 01:40.000
Meantime, be sure to finish
the repairs on the dam.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.060
You can count on us, Papa Smurf.

01:42.079 --> 01:44.009
- 'Bye!'
- 'Bye!'

01:45.049 --> 01:48.159
[sobbing]
Oh! Oh, I'll miss him so.

01:48.180 --> 01:51.159

Goodbye, Papa Smurf.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.060
[crying]

01:53.079 --> 01:54.229
I hate goodbyes!

01:55.009 --> 01:57.189
Well, you heard Papa Smurf.
We have a job to do.

01:57.210 --> 02:00.170
So let's get back
to work, work, work!

02:00.189 --> 02:03.129
Keep the smurf on, Brainy.
We haven't had lunch, yet.

I can just..

02:12.159 --> 02:14.199
I said get to work.

02:14.219 --> 02:16.189
And while
Papa Smurf is away

02:16.210 --> 02:19.219
he would want me
to be the boss.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.050
Head honcho, numero Smurfo.

02:22.069 --> 02:25.219
Now, look here, Brainy.
Who do you think you are?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.009
Uh..
Y-y-your-your natural leader?

02:29.030 --> 02:30.219

02:32.069 --> 02:35.009
Our leader?
Ha ha ha.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.210
Brainy, ha, that's so funny.
He he he.

02:38.229 --> 02:41.210

Well, I'll show them.

I'm a very important Smurf.

[all laughing]

03:01.050 --> 03:03.139
Harmony, you are a Smurf
of great musical talent.

03:03.159 --> 03:05.060
- Correct?
- Yeah.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.069

Stop! Ahem. I mean..
Ha ha. Uh-uh-uh..

03:14.099 --> 03:16.180
A musical maestro
of your caliber

03:16.199 --> 03:18.210
is deserving
of a higher position.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.159
- I am?
- 'Yes.'

03:20.180 --> 03:24.060
And I hereby appoint you
King Smurf's first chief

03:24.079 --> 03:26.159

03:26.180 --> 03:28.189
Great! Wow!

03:28.210 --> 03:32.000
- Uh, who is King Smurf?
- Me, of course.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.030
Now, here's your
very first announcement.

03:34.050 --> 03:36.189
But, uh, I'm a bugler.

...or else."

03:51.039 --> 03:54.030
King Smurf?
He must be joking.

03:54.050 --> 03:57.110
No, I do the jokes around here.

Brainy Smurf!

04:18.069 --> 04:19.040
Uh?

04:19.060 --> 04:20.069
If you think because

04:20.089 --> 04:21.120
Papa Smurf's gone

04:21.139 --> 04:23.029
you can do anything you want

04:23.050 --> 04:24.129
you're bananas.

05:16.069 --> 05:18.009
What?
Just a palace-pickin' minute!

05:18.029 --> 05:20.009
We still have work
to do on the dam.

05:20.029 --> 05:23.009
If he wants a palace,
let him build it himself.

My fellow Smurfs..

06:14.000 --> 06:17.089
...your labors have produced
a palace of great beauty.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.000
And I would say thanks

06:19.019 --> 06:21.110
if I didn't deserve
every bit of it.

Hey, Hefty.
I brought you a surprise.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.199
It better be something worthy
of a general colonel captain.

06:41.220 --> 06:45.189
I guarantee you'll get
a big bang out of it.

You're under arrest.
Now, get moving.

I opened the box--'

07:05.220 --> 07:09.060
And boom. Right?
Ha ha ha.

07:09.079 --> 07:11.180
That's one of Jokey's
oldest jokes.

07:11.199 --> 07:14.000
Where's your sense
of humor Hefty?

07:14.019 --> 07:17.139
- 'Case dismissed.'
- Thanks, King Smurf.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.120
Here's a little
something for you.

going to do?

08:02.029 --> 08:03.160
I don't know, Clumsy.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.230
But we better
think of something fast.

Headed for the woods.

09:00.220 --> 09:04.169
Rebels, eh? Don't just stand
there. Round up the troops!

09:04.190 --> 09:08.230
- Yes, sire.
- I'll soon put a stop to this.

09:09.009 --> 09:12.159
After all, I am the king.

09:12.179 --> 09:14.029
wham

09:16.080 --> 09:17.110
So, now what do we do?

09:17.129 --> 09:19.029
Your smurf
is as good as mine.

09:19.049 --> 09:20.200
I say we take a vote.

[yawning]
I say we take a nap.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.049
I say we break for lunch.

09:25.070 --> 09:26.179
What do you say, Clumsy?

09:26.200 --> 09:29.090
I say, yikes!

09:29.110 --> 09:30.220
- Yikes?
- Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.129
L-l-l-look what King Smurf
and his troops are d-doing.

'And to keep us out.'

09:43.039 --> 09:45.159
'For good.'

09:45.179 --> 09:49.009

10:55.039 --> 10:59.000
I told you this
was a sticky situation.

Charge!

11:14.169 --> 11:16.220
[clamoring]

11:17.000 --> 11:20.149
Code red! Stop those rebels.
Lift that..

11:20.169 --> 11:21.220
plop

11:22.000 --> 11:24.009
[all clamoring]

11:25.090 --> 11:28.049
(Papa Smurf)
'Stop! Stop! Stop!'

11:28.070 --> 11:30.019
- Papa Smurf?
- Papa Smurf?

11:30.039 --> 11:33.009
- Papa?
- Papa Smurf?

11:33.029 --> 11:35.070
You should all be ashamed.

11:35.090 --> 11:37.179
You've been behaving
like human beings.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.000
Now, our whole village
is a wreck.

11:40.019 --> 11:41.220
And what about the dam?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.200
[all gasp]
The dam!

11:43.220 --> 11:46.110
[dramatic music]

11:47.179 --> 11:49.090
Bring every log you can find.

11:49.110 --> 11:51.159
It's a matter
of smurf and death.

11:51.179 --> 11:53.059
[indistinct chatter]

11:54.179 --> 11:57.200
Shore up the dam.
I'll open the flood gate.

11:57.220 --> 12:00.139
[hammering]

12:01.029 --> 12:02.169
Argh!

12:07.110 --> 12:09.029
whoosh

12:09.049 --> 12:11.159
(all)
'Yay!'

12:11.179 --> 12:13.179
Wait, my palace!

12:13.200 --> 12:16.110
It's ruined.
It's ruined!

12:16.129 --> 12:19.059
You're lucky that's all
that's ruined, Brainy.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.029
The way you all have acted

12:21.049 --> 12:23.110
things could have
turned out much worse.

12:23.129 --> 12:26.230
I'm sorry, Papa Smurf.
I guess, I got carried away.

12:27.009 --> 12:29.129
'Now, I know there's a lot more
to being a good leader'

12:29.149 --> 12:31.059
than just giving orders.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.120
And I promise
to clean up all the mess.

12:34.139 --> 12:36.210
Wait, Brainy.
We'll all help.

12:36.230 --> 12:39.009
Yeah, we're all
in this together.

12:39.029 --> 12:41.000
Yup, uh, we were.

12:41.019 --> 12:43.070
Yup, yup.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.200
But, Papa,
what about these things?

12:45.220 --> 12:50.179
Well, Vanity, I'll see that
they are put to proper use.

12:52.149 --> 12:55.049
