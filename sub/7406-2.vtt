YOUR BUTT KICKED.

YOU HAVE TO QUIT.

I GOT A NEW COMPUTER-SIMULATED
FIGHT SEQUENCE IN THE GYM.

IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

04:22.513 --> 04:25.614
- I'M NOT SURE.

THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL.

04:39.227 --> 04:41.093

WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BE HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

05:31.472 --> 05:33.672
- SO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND HIM?

05:33.674 --> 05:35.607
- HE CANNOT TRAIN YOU.

05:35.609 --> 05:37.108

IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE THE TRUE MASTER
TO TELL ME THAT HIMSELF.

THE TRUE MASTER,

YOU MUST GET

BEFORE NIGHT FALLS.

05:47.517 --> 05:49.149

MANY HAVE TRIED.
MANY HAVE FAILED.

05:58.425 --> 06:01.359

FROM YOUR WORLD BEHIND.

08:13.841 --> 08:17.843

IN ROBIN'S ROOM WHEN HE IS AWAY.

THAT IS NOT A TOY.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.420
HE WOULD SAY
TO LEAVE THAT ALONE.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.455
- IF YOU'RE GONNA
TALK LIKE ROBIN,

08:32.457 --> 08:35.024
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
DRESS LIKE HIM, TOO.

08:35.026 --> 08:37.593
HE HAS MORE THAN ONE UNIFORM.

A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

- BAD GUYS, BEWARE.
THERE'S A NEW ROBIN IN TOWN.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.860
- [IMITATING MOTORCYCLE ENGINE]

14:19.397 --> 14:21.864
OK, MAN. MY TURN.

14:21.866 --> 14:22.898
- UH! NNGH!

14:22.900 --> 14:23.598
[BEEP]

14:23.600 --> 14:25.633
- ROBIN CALLING ROBIN.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.401
- ROBIN HERE. OVER.

14:27.403 --> 14:31.437
- NO, NOT YOU, ROBIN.
THE OTHER ROBIN.

14:31.439 --> 14:33.872
- WHAT'S UP, ROBIN?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.306
[IMITATING MOTORCYCLE ENGINE]

14:35.308 --> 14:37.107
- WELL, THIS IS JUST DISTURBING.

14:37.109 --> 14:40.743
- DISTURBING YET MAGNIFICENT.
JOIN US.

14:40.745 --> 14:43.679
I NEVER KNEW WEARING A CAPE
WAS SO MUCH FUN.

14:43.681 --> 14:45.947
IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE ROBIN.

14:45.949 --> 14:48.482
- YEAH.
HE HAS ALL THE BEST STUFF.

14:48.484 --> 14:51.585
- UH...RIGHT.

14:51.587 --> 14:55.588
- COME ON. HAVEN'T YOU EVER
WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE TO BE ROBIN?

14:55.590 --> 14:58.290
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TRY IT.

15:11.437 --> 15:12.936
- HOO HOO HOO!

15:12.938 --> 15:15.672
I AM THE GUARDIAN OF THE TREES.

15:15.674 --> 15:18.074
- [SIGH] AND IF I WANT
TO GET UP THE MOUNTAIN,

15:18.076 --> 15:21.610
I MUST FIRST DEFEAT YOU.

15:21.612 --> 15:23.778
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT?

15:23.780 --> 15:26.380
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING
TO SAY NEXT?

15:26.382 --> 15:29.182
- NO.
- ME NEITHER.

15:29.184 --> 15:32.785
BEEN A WHILE SINCE ANYONE HAS
GOTTEN THIS FAR UP THE MOUNTAIN.

15:32.787 --> 15:37.689
YOU MUST BE A GOOD WARRIOR
TO HAVE DEFEATED THE BEAR
AND THE SNAKE.

15:37.691 --> 15:39.791
- LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

15:39.793 --> 15:41.259
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:41.261 --> 15:44.161
WE DO NOT NEED TO FIGHT SO SOON.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?

15:44.163 --> 15:47.597
- I JUST WANT TO FIGHT YOU
SO I CAN GET TO THE TOP.

15:47.599 --> 15:49.265
- YES. I SEE.

15:49.267 --> 15:51.300
WE ARE VERY SERIOUS.

15:51.302 --> 15:53.235
YOUTH, LET'S GO.

15:58.575 --> 16:02.443
- UH! HYAH! HUH!

16:02.445 --> 16:05.312
- MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO.

16:05.314 --> 16:07.580
- AAH! HUH!

16:07.582 --> 16:09.481
- MONKEY JUST MADE
A FOOL OF YOU.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.483
HA HA HA!

16:11.485 --> 16:13.551
UNLESS YOU COULD
QUICKLY GROW A TAIL,

16:13.553 --> 16:16.186
IT APPEARS
YOU ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE.

16:16.188 --> 16:18.254
HA HA HA!

16:18.256 --> 16:20.222
[SCREECH]

16:20.224 --> 16:21.389
- RRGH!

16:21.391 --> 16:23.023
HUH! WHOA!

16:39.341 --> 16:41.641
MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO.

16:41.643 --> 16:44.310
- [SCREECH]

16:44.312 --> 16:46.478
OW! OOH!

16:46.480 --> 16:48.046
HA HA HA!

16:48.048 --> 16:49.380
HA HA HA!

16:49.382 --> 16:50.948
VERY WELL.

17:10.402 --> 17:12.335
- FINALLY.

17:17.007 --> 17:17.972
HUH!

17:17.974 --> 17:19.139
UH!

17:19.141 --> 17:20.406
GRR.

17:20.408 --> 17:24.343
- YOUR JOURNEY TO FIND
THE TRUE MASTER ENDS NOW.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.284
- UH! KITARO, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:33.286 --> 17:36.220
- TO TRAIN WITH THE TRUE MASTER,
OF COURSE.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.388
- YOU SAID YOU'D ALREADY
TRAINED WITH HIM.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.591
- THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO THINK.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.259
I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU,

17:42.261 --> 17:44.427
YOU WOULD GO AND SEEK
THE TRUE MASTER,

17:44.429 --> 17:48.530
AND ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
FOLLOW YOU UP THE MOUNTAIN.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.064
- WHY DID YOU NEED ME?

17:50.066 --> 17:52.299
- I COULD HAVE COME UP
WITHOUT YOU,

17:52.301 --> 17:56.235
BUT THEN I WOULD BE TIRED
FROM FIGHTING ALL THE CHALLENGES

17:56.237 --> 17:57.469
LIKE YOU ARE.

17:57.471 --> 18:00.404
- I'M NOT TOO TIRED
TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.107
RRAAGH!

18:04.109 --> 18:06.576
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO TRAIN
WITH THE TRUE MASTER.

18:06.578 --> 18:08.277
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT.

18:08.279 --> 18:12.014
- I DESERVE IT MORE THAN YOU.
I AM THE BETTER FIGHTER.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.787
YOU AREN'T SO TOUGH
WITHOUT YOUR WEAPONS.

18:19.789 --> 18:22.389
- I STILL HAVE YOUR WEAPONS.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.991
WAAH! HWAH!

18:24.993 --> 18:29.195
- UH! UGH! UH! UH!

18:29.197 --> 18:32.131
UH! UHH!

18:32.133 --> 18:33.632
- RISE, YOUNG WARRIOR.

18:33.634 --> 18:38.102
YOU MUST GET UP.
YOUR JOURNEY IS NOT OVER.

18:38.104 --> 18:39.369
- I CAN'T FIGHT HIM.

18:39.371 --> 18:42.105
HE HAS ALL MY WEAPONS.
I HAVE NOTHING.

18:42.107 --> 18:45.708
- WHEN YOU BEGAN YOUR JOURNEY,
YOU WERE DETERMINED.

18:45.710 --> 18:49.778
NOTHING COULD STOP YOU,
AND NOW THAT YOU ARE SO CLOSE,

18:49.780 --> 18:53.515
ARE YOU WILLING
TO GIVE UP SO EASILY?

18:53.517 --> 18:55.817
- IT WAS EASIER
AT THE BEGINNING.

18:55.819 --> 18:57.752
- BEGINNINGS ARE OFTEN EASIER,

18:57.754 --> 19:01.155
BUT THINK OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED ALONG YOUR JOURNEY,

19:01.157 --> 19:03.223
WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED
FROM YOUR BATTLES

19:03.225 --> 19:06.326
WITH THE BEAR,
THE SNAKE, THE MONKEY.

19:06.328 --> 19:08.561
- WHAT'S THE POINT OF FIGHTING
MY WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN

19:08.563 --> 19:10.930
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS JUST GOING
TO COME UP THE EASY WAY?

19:10.932 --> 19:14.767
- THERE IS ALWAYS
GOING TO BE SOMEONE
WHO DOES THINGS THE EASY WAY,

19:14.769 --> 19:19.137
BUT THAT SHOULD NOT STOP YOU
FROM DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY.

19:19.139 --> 19:21.772
IT IS YOUR JOURNEY,
YOUNG WARRIOR.

19:21.774 --> 19:24.474
ONLY YOU DECIDE WHEN IT ENDS.

19:30.014 --> 19:33.482
- TRUE MASTER,
I AM READY TO TRAIN.

19:33.484 --> 19:37.218
- YOU WILL SEE THE TRUE MASTER
WHEN YOU ARE READY.

19:39.422 --> 19:42.456
- HA! GIVE UP.
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.125
- I'VE BEATEN GUYS
MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU.

19:49.263 --> 19:51.963
- CLAWS OF THE IRON BEAR.

19:51.965 --> 19:54.231
- HYAAH! OOH!

19:54.233 --> 19:59.668
- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BEAT ME
IF YOU CANNOT EVEN SEE ME?

19:59.670 --> 20:01.636
- I DON'T NEED TO SEE YOU.

20:04.841 --> 20:06.841
- STRIKE OF THE FLYING SERPENT.

20:06.843 --> 20:08.576
- SSS!

20:08.578 --> 20:10.310
- UH! OOH!

20:12.480 --> 20:16.047
I SEE YOU ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT WINNING.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.548
SO AM I.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.351
- OO OO OO! [SCREECH]

20:22.353 --> 20:25.721
- DUEL OF THE LEAPING MONKEY.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.655
- [SCREECHING]

20:29.859 --> 20:32.292
- HUH! HWAH!

20:32.294 --> 20:34.460
WAAH! HUH!

20:34.462 --> 20:36.662
YAAH!

20:36.664 --> 20:37.729
HUH?

20:37.731 --> 20:39.163
UH!

20:41.333 --> 20:44.367
- THERE'S AN EASY WAY
AND A HARD WAY DOWN THIS HILL.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.202
LOOKS LIKE YOUR TAKING
THE HARD WAY.

20:49.407 --> 20:50.739
- YAAH!

20:50.741 --> 20:53.007
THE TRUE MASTER MUST TRAIN ME!

20:55.578 --> 20:57.644
- YOU DID NOT
MAKE IT UP THE MOUNTAIN

20:57.646 --> 20:59.145
ON YOUR OWN SKILLS.

20:59.147 --> 21:02.615
YOU TRIED BEFORE ON YOUR OWN,
BUT COULD NOT MAKE IT.

21:02.617 --> 21:05.351
YOU ARE A THIEF AND A CHEATER.

21:05.353 --> 21:07.653
THE TRUE MASTER
WILL NOT TRAIN YOU--

21:07.655 --> 21:10.055
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

21:10.057 --> 21:13.191
- BUT...
- TAKE HIM OFF MY MOUNTAIN.

21:18.431 --> 21:21.698
- CONSIDER THIS A GIFT
FOR SHOWING ME THE WAY.

21:23.535 --> 21:26.936
YOU'RE THE TRUE MASTER,
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

21:26.938 --> 21:28.737
- YOU NEVER ASKED.

21:28.739 --> 21:32.574
- SO WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT
THAT I GET TO THE TOP
BEFORE SUNSET?

21:32.576 --> 21:36.277
- IT IS MUCH EASIER TO SEE
THE PATH WHEN IT'S NOT DARK.

21:36.279 --> 21:40.914
- ALL THIS TIME, I THOUGHT
THERE WAS SOME DEEP MEANING
TO EVERYTHING YOU WERE SAYING.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.516
- AHH, YOUNG WARRIOR,

21:43.518 --> 21:47.552
YOU TAKE THINGS
MUCH TOO SERIOUSLY.

21:47.554 --> 21:50.688
- I AM READY TO TRAIN WITH YOU,
TRUE MASTER.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.823
- I BELIEVE YOU ARE.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.791
[STAFFS CLANG]

22:00.564 --> 22:04.432
- DO YOU DESIRE ANOTHER SLICE
OF THE CHEESE, ROBIN?

22:04.434 --> 22:07.368
- THANKS, ROBIN.
GOT ROOM FOR ANOTHER ONE, ROBIN?

22:07.370 --> 22:10.904
- DON'T MIND IF I DO, ROBIN.

22:10.906 --> 22:14.140
- YOU KNOW, ROBINS,
I HAVE TO ADMIT--

22:14.142 --> 22:16.408
THE MASK MAKES ME FEEL COOL.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.079
- HUH. PIZZA. SWEET!

22:25.650 --> 22:26.682
YOU KNOW, ROBINS,
