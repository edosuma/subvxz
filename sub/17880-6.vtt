00:06.818 --> 00:09.071
Sometimes, big companies
make big mistakes.

00:09.196 --> 00:10.247
Like yesterday's,

00:10.372 --> 00:12.756
which caused a million fish
in Lake Michigan to grow fur.

00:12.881 --> 00:15.389
Luckily,
today's mistake is a little one.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.441
Someone pried a window open
on the 20th floor.

00:18.566 --> 00:20.853
Wanna go scare the crap
out of floors 1 through 19?

00:21.152 --> 00:22.562
Be careful with the dummy.

00:22.687 --> 00:24.805
He's scheduled to get hit
by a train at 4:30.

00:24.930 --> 00:25.775
Secondly,

00:25.943 --> 00:27.558
I have to go to human resources.

00:27.683 --> 00:30.099
They made a mistake
on my new I.D. badge.

00:30.224 --> 00:32.019
"Ted Chips." That's funny.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.241
Although not as funny
as your real name.

00:34.882 --> 00:36.465
Ted Crisp? That's not funny.

00:36.590 --> 00:38.992
It's not "make people think
someone jumped off the roof" funny,

00:39.117 --> 00:41.332
but it's still pretty funny.
And don't bother with H.R.

00:41.655 --> 00:44.059
 I can fix any I.D.
with a razor blade and some wite-out.

00:44.184 --> 00:46.504
Trust me,
I've been 21 since I was 15.

00:46.924 --> 00:50.095
Thanks, anyway. I think I'll just let
H.R. handle it, play by the rules.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.300
You love rules.

00:51.597 --> 00:54.959
You should marry a rule
and have little rule children,

00:55.084 --> 00:57.223
then build a house made of rules.

00:57.856 --> 00:59.725
You mean a house
made of my own children?

01:00.422 --> 01:02.513
That's between you
and your conscience.

01:07.979 --> 01:08.979
All right.

01:09.545 --> 01:10.820
Let's call up your file

01:10.988 --> 01:13.188
and see what the problem is,
Mr. Chips.

01:13.313 --> 01:15.160
It's "Crisp." Ted Crisp.

01:15.657 --> 01:17.405
No, it says "Chips."

01:17.645 --> 01:18.661
"Ted Chips."

01:18.829 --> 01:20.454
I know, but that's not my name.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.692
Don't take this wrong,
but are you sure?

01:22.817 --> 01:26.377
Because it is very unlikely the system
would make a mistake like that.

01:26.618 --> 01:28.190
I think I know my last name.

01:28.315 --> 01:30.673
It's the one thing my father and I
agree on.

01:34.797 --> 01:36.497
Let's see if this helps.

01:37.856 --> 01:39.140
It did not help at all.

01:39.308 --> 01:42.643
This is a first.
The system just deleted you.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.604
What do you mean, deleted me?

01:44.729 --> 01:46.230
Can you re-lete me?

01:49.582 --> 01:51.277
There's no record of you anywhere.

01:51.552 --> 01:52.820
So what happens now?

01:53.345 --> 01:55.906
Don't worry.
I'll just report it to I.T.

01:59.463 --> 02:01.513
That's gonna be some paperwork.

02:05.151 --> 02:07.347
- Teddy, how's it going?
- Good, Ryan, how are you?

02:08.032 --> 02:10.588
My wife's knee
is giving her problems again.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.089
- Damn it.
- I know.

02:12.481 --> 02:16.218
I told her, "you weigh 400 pounds."
"The knee is not designed for that."

02:16.545 --> 02:17.819
That's great advice.

02:17.944 --> 02:20.639
Listen, my badge
is giving me a little problem.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.283
- Can I borrow yours to get in the lab?
- No can do.

02:23.408 --> 02:26.675
That would be crossing the system,
and I never cross the system,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.065
which isn't hard, because, frankly,
it is a great system.

02:30.694 --> 02:33.225
My problem was growing
as big as Ryan's wife.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.356
Now neither of us
could get through a door.

02:35.481 --> 02:38.429
And so my team was gonna have
to go on without me.

02:38.554 --> 02:41.404
This jet pack project
is gonna be so exciting.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.996
Jet packs are the ultimate dream
of every scientist.

02:44.193 --> 02:47.272
Skies teeming with ordinary citizens
strapped to rockets.

02:47.397 --> 02:50.544
Flying through the air
at 60 miles an hour in any direction.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.672
A lot of people are going to die.

02:54.004 --> 02:56.634
Where's Ted? It's not like him
to be late to a meeting.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.344
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

02:58.689 --> 02:59.989
Maybe he's dead.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.932
He's not dead, Patricia.
You think everyone's dead.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
People die.
Ask my dead neighbor.

03:05.754 --> 03:07.394
He could be at the vending machine.

03:08.648 --> 03:10.730
Perhaps that new yogurt
caught his eye.

03:10.855 --> 03:12.902
He doesn't eat yogurt. He's Ted.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.528
He's more likely out hitting a home run
or foiling a robbery...

03:15.697 --> 03:17.445
Stop it!
We're scientists,

03:17.570 --> 03:20.252
not people who can examine
every variable of a phenomenon

03:20.377 --> 03:22.827
to determine an accurate understanding
of a specific event.

03:22.995 --> 03:23.994
Ted's late.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.998
We can't know why any more than we can
unlock the secrets of the universe.

03:29.945 --> 03:31.752
See how order breaks down
without Ted?

03:31.920 --> 03:35.520
If only he was here, he could tell us
what to do without him.

03:36.933 --> 03:39.496
I spoke to them.
They say it's just a computer glitch.

03:39.621 --> 03:41.606
And since they back up the system
every week,

03:41.731 --> 03:44.654
the easiest way to get you restored
is to just reboot.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.268
- Good. So when do they do that?
- Never.

03:47.921 --> 03:49.144
That's the easiest way.

03:49.312 --> 03:53.000
But rebooting would shut down
Veridian's entire worldwide operations,

03:53.125 --> 03:55.738
and that means money,
which the company never parts

03:55.863 --> 03:58.235
with unless forced to
by a government stronger than they are,

03:58.360 --> 04:00.396
and there's only 3 of those left.

04:00.984 --> 04:02.206
This is ridiculous,

04:02.331 --> 04:04.257
And frankly,
I don't like not existing.

04:04.382 --> 04:05.894
It... saddens me.

04:06.614 --> 04:10.248
They'll fix it. And don't be sad.
You'll get all wrinkly.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.805
You missed an important meeting.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.875
- Were you having yogurt?
- Will you let that go?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.301
- He doesn't eat yogurt, right?
- Right.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.304
That new one does look intriguing.

04:25.912 --> 04:28.142
Look at them.
They don't know what to do with that.

04:28.684 --> 04:30.463
Ted temporarily can't go to the lab.

04:30.588 --> 04:32.899
Reschedule the meeting
for the conference room.

04:33.024 --> 04:36.152
All the components are in the lab.
Moving them is not practical.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.652
We have a test flight
scheduled in two days.

04:38.777 --> 04:40.487
That means a lot of coordination...

04:41.649 --> 04:43.449
No wonder the system deleted you.

04:44.924 --> 04:47.225
Fine,
I'll take care of your precious lab.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.800
Leave it all to me.

04:49.881 --> 04:52.791
You're in charge of the lab.
I leave it all to you.

04:53.203 --> 04:55.252
- Me?
- I don't like it down there.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.214
It's chilly, the people are odd,
and it smells like science.

04:58.539 --> 05:00.597
I'm not a huge fan of that place,
either.

05:00.722 --> 05:04.178
Last time I was down there, I got chased
by some weird 8-legged bird.

05:05.091 --> 05:07.891
The octo-chicken.
We had such hopes for that.

05:08.552 --> 05:09.433
Anyway,

05:09.601 --> 05:11.527
if you have any problems...
any at all,

05:11.652 --> 05:12.811
you come see me.

05:13.623 --> 05:17.204
Although, that would be a huge admission
of failure on your part.

05:21.844 --> 05:24.782
The online protections are important.
The charts... Hang on.

05:25.139 --> 05:27.409
Who are you?
What are you doing in my office?

05:27.916 --> 05:30.829
I'm Jim from marketing.
They told me this was my new office.

05:36.048 --> 05:37.248
Individuals...

05:37.769 --> 05:39.838
We believe everyone is special,

05:40.292 --> 05:41.442
irreplaceable

05:42.329 --> 05:45.010
and will follow the thing
walking in front of it.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.728
That's why we celebrate
all individuals,

05:48.375 --> 05:50.269
Even ones going nowhere.

05:52.535 --> 05:54.441
Because you can't spell "individual"

05:54.566 --> 05:55.809
without "Veridian"...

05:56.200 --> 05:57.200
and "u"...

05:58.017 --> 05:59.067
and an "l".

06:01.178 --> 06:03.946
I can't take it anymore, Janet.
First the lab,

06:04.282 --> 06:05.482
now my office.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.616
I still work here. I exist.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.084
I know you exist.

06:09.209 --> 06:11.161
The computer's the one
you have to convince.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.622
Can't you just add me back
into the system?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.490
Do you have a 4-57 code?

06:15.990 --> 06:16.994
I might.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.596
Why, yes, I do.

06:21.989 --> 06:23.173
Only new hires

06:23.454 --> 06:25.259
are assigned 4-57 codes,

06:25.615 --> 06:29.115
and only people with 4-57 codes
can be entered into the system.

06:31.677 --> 06:34.394
What if I reapply for the position?

06:35.043 --> 06:38.393
I fill out an application
for a job that I already have.

06:38.857 --> 06:39.857
Finally,

06:40.504 --> 06:42.443
you say something that makes sense.

06:44.354 --> 06:46.822
While I was figuring out
how to get back in the system,

06:47.139 --> 06:49.583
Linda was figuring out
how to be in charge.

06:50.068 --> 06:51.568
Everybody, be quiet.

06:52.072 --> 06:54.000
Now let's start again,

06:54.348 --> 06:56.298
and say it in Layman's terms.

06:56.861 --> 06:59.668
See if you can follow this.
Lem is an idiot.

07:00.430 --> 07:02.999
See if you can follow this.
That hurt my feelings.

07:03.124 --> 07:04.124
Snap!

07:04.584 --> 07:06.258
And why do you get to be in charge?

07:06.429 --> 07:08.927
As I recall, you were the only one
who ran from the octo-chicken.

07:09.236 --> 07:11.930
It freaked me out
when it came down from its web.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.144
You're weak
and have no leadership qualities.

07:14.269 --> 07:15.314
I can lead.

07:15.517 --> 07:18.020
Maybe you're just a crappy follower.
Did you ever think of that?

07:19.189 --> 07:21.116
Can we please
get back to the jet pack?

07:21.241 --> 07:24.709
- Because it has to fly in 24 hours.
- And since I'm the one going up in it,

07:24.834 --> 07:27.054
it'd be nice
if the hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio

07:27.179 --> 07:28.864
was below the burn flash point.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.242
I miss Ted. How do you know
if two people have chemistry?

07:36.955 --> 07:38.923
How do you manage
all those scientists

07:39.048 --> 07:42.378
with their egos and bickering
and full-frontal nerdity?

07:42.546 --> 07:44.263
Just listen to everyone carefully,

07:44.388 --> 07:47.299
make them feel heard, study the issues
and make firm decisions.

07:48.241 --> 07:50.441
Could you give that to me
in Layman's terms?

07:50.987 --> 07:53.111
All right, look,
they're like animals.

07:53.236 --> 07:55.432
They respond more to tone
than actual words.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.019
They also like treats, it's why
I keep caramels.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.588
I can't believe the company
is treating you like this.

08:02.713 --> 08:04.482
Doesn't it make you want to scream

08:04.607 --> 08:06.283
or put your fist through a wall

08:06.408 --> 08:08.445
or rub your junk
on the C.E.O.'s chair?

08:10.154 --> 08:12.950
And I only use my junk for good,
not evil.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.913
With great junk
comes great responsibility.

08:20.429 --> 08:21.834
You filed a job application?

08:22.075 --> 08:24.711
I need a 4-57 code
to get back in the system.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.672
That triggered a 2-29 protocol.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.641
Which means I now have to give you
a job interview...

08:30.766 --> 08:32.594
Theodore Margaret Crisp.

08:32.842 --> 08:33.933
Job interview?

08:34.058 --> 08:37.432
And it's pronounced "mar-gar-ray".
It's a family name.

08:39.116 --> 08:40.644
It means "lamb of god."

08:41.020 --> 08:43.472
I don't care.
Now let's begin this charade.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.941
Or as "mar-gar-ray"
would say... "sha-rod".

08:46.995 --> 08:48.777
So why should we hire you

08:48.945 --> 08:50.779
over any of
the other qualified applicants?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.030
Other applicants?

08:52.837 --> 08:54.154
Your filing this application

08:54.279 --> 08:56.410
caused the system to think
the position was open.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.534
Can't you just hire me
without doing this?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.622
Sorry.
That would be breaking the rules.

09:02.351 --> 09:04.501
But it's me.
And you.

09:05.415 --> 09:08.714
Look, it's only a formality.
You're going to get your job back.

09:08.910 --> 09:10.674
The process is just gonna be long

09:11.099 --> 09:14.873
- and extraordinarily humiliating.
- I'd like to believe, after everything

09:14.998 --> 09:16.930
I've done for this company
over the years,

09:17.162 --> 09:19.516
they'd show me a little more loyalty
than this.

09:19.724 --> 09:22.936
I know It's hard to accept that
giant companies don't care about people.

09:23.283 --> 09:26.304
I know how hard it was for me
when I first realized it...

09:26.429 --> 09:27.579
when I was 8.

09:28.215 --> 09:29.991
If the company doesn't need me,

09:30.116 --> 09:31.403
then I don't need it,

09:31.948 --> 09:32.703
so...

09:33.114 --> 09:34.364
I'm going home.

09:37.073 --> 09:38.452
And I may not come back.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.662
Come on, Ted, we'll sort it out.

09:40.984 --> 09:42.873
Meanwhile,
we'll set you up with a laptop

09:43.041 --> 09:44.791
in a nice, roomy handicapped stall.

09:47.307 --> 09:48.712
It has its own bathroom.

09:56.384 --> 09:57.429
Ted went home?

09:57.978 --> 10:00.098
I heard his job interview
did not go well.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.684
- What if he never comes back?
- This is real, people.

10:03.309 --> 10:04.561
This is real.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.654
He is supposed to inform us
when he leaves the premises.

10:07.779 --> 10:10.651
- It's not okay. It's not...
- All right, all right, that's enough!

10:10.919 --> 10:13.714
Listen to my tone and not my words.

10:14.018 --> 10:17.060
We can't just stand here
and let them take Ted away from us.

10:17.185 --> 10:19.243
He is the shiniest employee we have.

10:19.776 --> 10:21.208
Did you just say "shiniest"?

10:21.333 --> 10:24.322
Again, listen to my tone
and not my words.

10:24.527 --> 10:26.208
We have to do something.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.633
Linda's tone is right.

10:28.258 --> 10:29.897
We can't function without Ted.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.192
So what do we do, interim boss?

10:35.587 --> 10:37.973
We have to work together
and come up with a plan.

10:39.189 --> 10:41.557
We suck at working together.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.505
Then let's go talk to the one person
who can un-suck us.

10:44.909 --> 10:46.210
Follow me, people.

10:49.794 --> 10:51.364
I am showing leadership.

10:55.558 --> 10:56.822
And I have caramels.

11:00.630 --> 11:04.504
I'm flattered you guys are all here.
But the company doesn't care about me.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.581
This is a good learning moment
for the girl.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.584
You are born alone
and you die alone.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.627
You're Dr. Bhamba, right?

11:11.356 --> 11:13.672
We are not here
because the company needs you.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.713
We're here because we need you.

11:15.838 --> 11:17.801
You bring out
the best in each of us.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.971
You take a bunch of barely
functional, socially awkward,

11:21.139 --> 11:22.431
semi-creepy scientists

11:23.028 --> 11:25.530
and one beautifully normal
product tester,

11:25.655 --> 11:27.561
and you make us a team.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.273
We love you, Ted.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.404
And I like working with all of you.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.700
Consider me hugged.

11:47.558 --> 11:48.832
I was thinking...

11:50.467 --> 11:54.087
I was leading, and I thought,
what if we crashed the mainframe?

11:55.957 --> 11:58.175
When it rebooted,
he'd be back in the system, right?

12:00.646 --> 12:04.181
We can feed it a virus that
overloads it with illogical information.

12:04.349 --> 12:08.018
It would think it's malfunctioning,
then would shut down and reboot itself.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.437
How Linda does
when we explain how stuff works.

12:12.269 --> 12:14.441
You guys would be willing
to do that for me?

12:17.408 --> 12:18.779
You'd be risking your jobs.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.615
Come on.
Let's break some rules.

12:21.873 --> 12:23.241
Let's crash it up.

12:24.904 --> 12:26.392
All right. I'm in.

12:28.836 --> 12:31.583
But I don't get it. You've always said
breaking the rules is wrong.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.499
Rose is right. We can't do it.

12:35.264 --> 12:37.312
Because we should never
break the rules.

12:38.046 --> 12:39.966
She goes to bed in half an hour.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.893
It felt good to be wanted
and to be back in charge...

12:48.018 --> 12:51.185
and to have rose safely tucked in bed
so she wouldn't ask questions

12:51.310 --> 12:53.041
and so we could use her toys.

12:54.010 --> 12:57.192
Patricia, you will stand by the elevator
here to make sure nobody gets by.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.861
I still have some excellent caution tape
from when my neighbor died.

13:00.198 --> 13:01.988
That's right, Linda. People die.

13:03.442 --> 13:06.377
All the security guards at Veridian,
including Ryan,

13:06.786 --> 13:10.074
have a full-access badge
that opens every door in the building.

13:10.349 --> 13:11.805
I'll distract Ryan

13:13.293 --> 13:15.005
while Ted gets his badge.

13:15.601 --> 13:18.880
While Linda does that,
I will run the badge down here

13:19.048 --> 13:20.503
to where Lem and Phil

13:20.628 --> 13:23.719
are waiting outside the door
to the mainframe computer room.

13:24.356 --> 13:25.762
Which one of those am I?

13:26.664 --> 13:29.116
I know. I'm pepper.
Because I'm spicy.

13:29.477 --> 13:31.458
And I'm salty, like a sea captain.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.093
- I haven't yet heard "Bhamba."
- Dr. Bhamba.

13:34.218 --> 13:36.440
- There it is.
- You are our technical expert.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.067
So it is your job
to disable the cameras

13:39.486 --> 13:40.853
outside the computer room.

13:40.978 --> 13:42.612
Those cameras are complicated.

13:42.737 --> 13:45.161
They are a high-resolution,
3-chip matrix system.

13:45.286 --> 13:46.620
This will be a challenge.

13:52.709 --> 13:53.609
Bhamba... 1.

13:53.734 --> 13:56.369
High-resolution, 3 chip matrix system...
0.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:08.363 --> 14:10.627
They were supposed
to bring my new badge by.

14:10.752 --> 14:13.477
- Did it get here yet?
- Nothing's crossed my desk, Teddy.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.180
It should be here any second.
Why don't you go ahead?

14:19.578 --> 14:21.467
I wish there was a badge
to get into that.

14:21.592 --> 14:22.319
Amen.

14:23.318 --> 14:24.321
Shoot.

14:24.779 --> 14:26.531
Is your card not working?

14:27.716 --> 14:29.088
It's not the card.

14:29.839 --> 14:31.828
It's these damn breasts of mine.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.812
I'm taking this new medication,
and it's making 'em so big and perky.

14:37.439 --> 14:39.211
Do they look strange to you?

14:39.852 --> 14:42.339
Don't worry about those breasts.
They're top-shelf.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.735
You can't tell from over there.

14:46.234 --> 14:47.258
Come closer.

14:59.911 --> 15:00.956
Oh, my gosh.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.477
This reminds me of this time
when I was in college...

15:07.115 --> 15:08.740
Did you disable the camera?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.134
Did you disable
your stupid-question filter?

15:11.259 --> 15:12.559
I thought I did.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.170
Oh, my gosh, it was just so crazy.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.007
We were all playing in the mud,

15:24.275 --> 15:27.425
I get into the shower,
obviously totally nude,

15:27.778 --> 15:30.858
- and guess who's in there?
- Who? Who?

15:32.661 --> 15:34.558
My two sorority sisters.

15:35.484 --> 15:38.036
They were...
just vaginas everywhere.

15:38.161 --> 15:40.071
- Man, I love those.
- Right?

15:40.987 --> 15:42.649
Well, I gotta go make my rounds.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.722
- You wanna come with me?
- Sure.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.363
Let me just get my badge.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.356
My badge is gone.

15:54.961 --> 15:56.486
So is my underwear?

16:03.527 --> 16:04.337
Got it.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.300
You have your flash drive
with the virus on it?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.136
- Aye!
- You're so salty.

16:13.382 --> 16:14.306
Don't move!

16:18.686 --> 16:20.875
I caught them all
trying to break in.

16:31.899 --> 16:34.634
Security stopped us
before we could crash the mainframe.

16:34.759 --> 16:38.347
And since Veronica was our supervisor,
that's who they took us to see.

16:39.551 --> 16:41.795
None of this would've happened
if it weren't for you.

16:42.189 --> 16:44.367
My boobs worked their ass off.

16:44.717 --> 16:47.088
You rallied all these people.
You got 'em out of the lab

16:47.213 --> 16:49.627
and into the sunlight
and down to my house.

16:49.983 --> 16:52.302
You stepped up.
That's what leaders do.

16:53.505 --> 16:54.383
Thanks.

16:55.142 --> 16:58.320
It turns out it's easy to lead
when it's for something you care about.

17:01.315 --> 17:04.183
I hope I made myself clear.

17:04.308 --> 17:05.876
Yes, sir, I understand.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.075
You've all disappointed me.

17:10.496 --> 17:11.938
That's punishment enough.

17:13.715 --> 17:14.616
I'm kidding.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.884
Get in here.

17:18.794 --> 17:21.665
You tried to shut the computer down
by driving it crazy?

17:21.833 --> 17:24.834
Making it think it was malfunctioning
is the only way to get it to reboot

17:25.002 --> 17:27.051
and put Ted back in the system.

17:28.266 --> 17:29.109
Ma'am.

17:29.685 --> 17:32.483
I should have you all
fired or demoted

17:32.608 --> 17:34.594
or put you in the tank
with the octo-chicken.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.806
What you did was thoughtless,
reckless, unprofessional,

17:38.467 --> 17:40.225
Veronica yeled at us
for half an hour.

17:40.924 --> 17:43.603
Finally, she ran out of adjectives
and was done.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.300
... vertical and lactose intolerant.

17:48.674 --> 17:49.693
Any questions?

17:50.166 --> 17:51.027
I have one.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.737
How did they find us so quickly?

17:53.042 --> 17:55.365
They tracked Ryan's missing badge
to the basement.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.200
They can track his badge?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.211
Our new badges can be tracked.
That way,

17:59.336 --> 18:01.955
- the system always knows where we are.
- That's creepy.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.107
If the system lived
in its mother's basement,

18:04.232 --> 18:06.689
it would be exactly
like this guy I used to date.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.560
Ma'am.

18:08.685 --> 18:11.320
Speaking of badges,
I'm gonna need all of yours.

18:11.544 --> 18:13.415
After the jet pack test
this afternoon,

18:13.540 --> 18:16.145
you're all being bumped down
to lower security clearances.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.471
Don't take their badges.
This is my fault.

18:19.103 --> 18:20.605
That's very noble, Ted.

18:20.730 --> 18:24.249
The company would be a much better place
if someone like you were working here.

18:28.699 --> 18:30.734
You'd better come back in one piece.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.244
- You're my ride home.
- If I don't make it back,

18:34.674 --> 18:36.235
my mom will pick you up.

18:37.098 --> 18:37.861
Wait!

18:40.187 --> 18:42.078
Legal says you have to wear
a parachute.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.290
Why? At the height I'm going,
a parachute will be useless.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.542
Not from a legal standpoint.
Good luck.

18:50.014 --> 18:53.715
The truth was, legal couldn't care less
if Lem wore a parachute or not.

18:54.539 --> 18:56.640
In fact, it wasn't even a parachute.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.701
It turned out something had happened
that convinced Veronica

18:59.826 --> 19:02.200
to also break some rules
and go against the system.

19:02.325 --> 19:04.225
You want me to replace Ted?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.978
I didn't say that.
I just want you to hire this applicant

19:07.146 --> 19:09.564
to fill Ted's position,
which the system says

19:09.732 --> 19:11.065
is technically vacant.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.365
But, Chet, the interviews
were just a formality.

19:13.490 --> 19:15.862
We were always gonna hire Ted
for Ted's position.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.211
Look, I love Ted.
He's one of our best people.

19:18.336 --> 19:20.365
But this kid's fresh out
of business school

19:20.490 --> 19:22.452
and comes
at a fraction of the price.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.705
If it would help you make
the transition, I'm sure

19:25.873 --> 19:27.415
he'd let you call him "Ted".

19:31.837 --> 19:34.657
I hope I made myself clear,
Veronica.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.312
Yes, sir, I understood.

19:37.332 --> 19:40.360
Veronica realized
from our nearly flawless plan

19:40.485 --> 19:43.231
that overloading the system
with illogical information

19:43.356 --> 19:44.774
would make it crash,

19:45.482 --> 19:47.720
and so she spent
the next several hours

19:47.845 --> 19:50.346
collecting as many other badges
as she could.

19:54.249 --> 19:56.839
Then, knowing the system
would track the badges,

19:56.964 --> 20:00.406
she made it think that 75 employees
crammed into a knapsack

20:01.123 --> 20:02.700
and shot themselves into space.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.314
Since this made no sense,

20:19.439 --> 20:21.344
the computer freaked out
and crashed.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.063
It was the reboot
heard round the world.

20:37.518 --> 20:40.782
The plan was a success,
and just like that, I existed again.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.286
What changed your mind
about breaking the rules?

20:47.215 --> 20:50.651
What are you talking about? I never
break the rules, you shouldn't, either,

20:50.776 --> 20:53.585
cause you couldn't pull off a caper
if it was sitting on a plate of lox.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.962
Thank for not doing
what you didn't do.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.310
It's nice to have you back,

20:58.776 --> 21:01.134
but if you hate the company so much,
why'd you return?

21:02.769 --> 21:03.636
That's why.

21:06.379 --> 21:07.679
I like cupcakes.

21:08.188 --> 21:11.306
I don't, especially
when they're frosted with emotion.

21:14.202 --> 21:16.441
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, guys.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.186
These aren't for you.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.112
We're heading up to the 20th floor.
The window's still open.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.239
Wanna come break some rules?

21:24.931 --> 21:27.201
Sure, let's go
make it rain cupcakes.
