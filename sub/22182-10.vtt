WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.271
Go, go, go, go!

00:03.304 --> 00:04.505
They have the package.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.075
We're going down.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.512
I'm an American citizen.
Don't let him do this!

00:11.545 --> 00:12.513
Move, or I will
shoot through you.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.783
GALLO: The prisoner who got away
is Davis Goundry.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.485
We stumbled onto
something here.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.786
Davis Goundry is a former

00:18.819 --> 00:19.787
Agency operative who flipped.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.155
He knows the locations

00:21.189 --> 00:22.590
of Khalid's safe houses.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.225
Jimmy is being held
at one of them.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.494
Jimmy...
I don't have much time.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.496
A man named Khalid has sent

00:28.529 --> 00:31.432
uranium to an associate
in the U.S. to make a bomb.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.602
Of all the pilots that could
have been in this helo...

00:34.635 --> 00:35.703
It's like it was
meant to be.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.672
SERENITY: I can take him.
Engage.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.809
Hey, where are the safe houses?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.212
Tell me!
He's gone.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.214
There's no bomb in here.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.482
Sergeant Cho told me she heard
something over the comms.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.551
Made it sound like Goundry
knew the soldiers

00:50.584 --> 00:52.486
from that night in Somalia--
they're hiding something.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.621
It's time we knew what.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.156
Davis gave me this.

00:55.189 --> 00:58.659
He said it'll give you
the answers you need.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.434
Okay.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.649
There we go.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.195
Classic.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.672
If you're watching this,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.640
it means that I'm dead.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.312
But I don't want the truth
to die with me,

01:51.345 --> 01:54.548
so I need you
to listen carefully.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.719
*

02:04.625 --> 02:09.863
* Black, like a nuclear bomb

02:12.500 --> 02:16.570
* You feel the pain come

02:16.604 --> 02:18.406
* The pain come

02:18.439 --> 02:23.577
* As the swelling aches

02:23.611 --> 02:25.613
* For fun.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.666
Good morning.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.501
Hey.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.937
How early did you get up?

02:49.970 --> 02:53.674
I, uh, had a lot
of thinking to do.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.647
I need to tell you
something, Ian.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.649
Okay.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.418
Something happened in Somalia.

03:04.452 --> 03:07.655
I lied in my debrief.

03:07.688 --> 03:11.392
I said that Richard
and the prisoner bailed on us

03:11.425 --> 03:12.660
before we went down,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.862
and that we never
saw them again.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.731
But they were in the helo
when we crashed.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.601
And I saw the prisoner's face.
Slow down...

03:20.634 --> 03:22.870
I couldn't let him drown,
so I pulled off the hood,

03:22.903 --> 03:25.339
and he wasn't a Somali,
like they told us.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.740
He was an American.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.742
I know now
it was Davis Goundry,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.379
but Gallo and I didn't find that
out until after we got back.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.247
Davis Goundry, who we just...
Yes. Yes.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.485
Richard was going to kill him.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.655
Go on.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.729
I shot Richard.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.634
I killed him.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.678
I...

04:04.712 --> 04:06.280
I don't even know
where to start.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.815
I had to do it.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.318
He was going
to shoot Gallo, too.

04:12.886 --> 04:13.987
Who is it?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.923
Headquarters.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.825
You should answer.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.397
Um...
this is Madani.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.567
Yeah.
Of course.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.701
I'll be right there.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.842
They want me to go
in to headquarters

04:34.875 --> 04:37.845
for a follow-up debrief
about Springer Mountain.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.647
Are you going to
tell them all this?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.815
No, Gallo and I
made the decision

04:41.849 --> 04:43.484
not to say anything until
we could find out the truth.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.954
We didn't know
who we could trust...

04:46.987 --> 04:49.857
I'm sorry.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.727
Right.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.364
You realize how many
rules you've broken?

04:59.032 --> 05:01.735
You'll be court-martialed
for this, Nora.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.804
If we can prove that we did
the right thing back there,

05:03.837 --> 05:06.507
then we can clear our names.

05:06.540 --> 05:10.644
And Goundry told me that he was
not the traitor, Richard was.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.879
Yeah, well, he's dead now.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.980
It's gonna be
pretty damn hard to prove.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.782
We still have to try.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.752
Have you thought about how...

05:18.786 --> 05:21.522
how insane all of this is?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.861
I can't think
about anything else.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.334
I have to go.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.946
This is Porter.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.820
Yeah. Yes, sir.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.922
Will do, sir.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.929
They want me to come in,
too, now.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.604
Morning, Lieutenant.
Madani.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.172
Captain.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.641
Thank you, Captain Gallo,
we'll let you know

06:13.674 --> 06:15.909
if we need anything else.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.414
Which one of us would you
like to interview first?

06:20.448 --> 06:21.849
Oh, no, we're
interviewing her.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.184
We just need you here
for observation.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.019
I wasn't in the
helo last night

06:26.053 --> 06:27.655
when Goundry was.
I can't speak

06:27.688 --> 06:29.056
to Ms. Madani's account
of what happened.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.925
Uh, of course, but you've
been such a crucial

06:31.959 --> 06:33.861
part of the operation
from the beginning.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.430
I would really appreciate
your insight here.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.066
But not for
Captain Gallo's interview.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.503
We had a lightbulb moment.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.937
Come on in.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.708
Hey.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.110
Find me after.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.151
THEA:
I had an illuminating exchange

06:58.185 --> 07:00.087
with Sergeant Cho last night.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.690
Based on some things she heard
over the comms, it seemed to her

07:02.723 --> 07:05.559
that you and Gallo
had met Goundry before.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.860
Ma'am, I don't know what
she could have heard

07:06.894 --> 07:08.161
to make her think that.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.697
He was talking to us,
sure, but that's...

07:09.730 --> 07:10.998
According to Sergeant Cho,
he said, I quote,

07:11.031 --> 07:12.900
"You saw it,"
referring to a scenario

07:12.933 --> 07:15.969
in which he had a hood
over his head.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.572
He was saying a lot
of crazy things.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.007
I can't remember all of them.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.175
He had a gun on us.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.011
THEA: We've taken
the liberty of pulling

07:24.044 --> 07:26.914
your debrief from the mission
that started all of this.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.616
You said Richard
and the prisoner bailed

07:28.649 --> 07:30.250
after the helo crashed,
that you never saw them again.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.019
That's correct.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.053
Was the hood ever removed
from the prisoner's head

07:33.086 --> 07:34.522
in your presence?

07:34.555 --> 07:37.725
No.
That prisoner was
Davis Goundry.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.027
You were helping
the Agency exfil him

07:40.060 --> 07:41.595
after he turned traitor.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.897
That is, until Khalid's men
spotted your helo

07:43.931 --> 07:46.066
and shot it down.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.901
So, if your story
from that night is true,

07:47.935 --> 07:49.770
and you never saw the guy,

07:49.803 --> 07:52.973
how would Davis Goundry
know who you are?

07:53.006 --> 07:57.210
Maybe he saw us that night,
through the hood.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.912
I thought I was here to talk
about Springer Mountain,

07:58.946 --> 08:00.548
not Somalia.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.916
Well, there are some missing
links between the two.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.252
Like why Goundry returned
to the U.S. in the first place,

08:05.285 --> 08:06.987
or what happened
to Officer Richard.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.122
I think you may have
some answers.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.058
With all due respect, ma'am,
the goal of this operation

08:11.091 --> 08:12.793
is finding Sergeant Kam.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.895
It's not clear to me how
any of these questions

08:14.928 --> 08:16.263
help us do that.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.898
What is clear to me
is that Ms. Madani has

08:17.931 --> 08:20.133
nothing further to offer us.
You may go.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.202
Thank you.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.278
Did you get what you wanted
by having me here?

08:31.311 --> 08:35.015
I figured she wouldn't lie
in front of you.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.851
A valiant effort, Thea,
and now a dead one.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.152
Sir, it doesn't add up
that Goundry turned.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.088
No bomb was found
on his person last night,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.856
and the only proof
that we have that he's bad

08:42.890 --> 08:44.658
is the proof Richard gave us.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.827
Yeah, that is proof from a
CIA officer, your mentor,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.596
and suddenly it's not
good enough for you?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.766
It is possible that Goundry
returned to the U.S.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.067
for another reason.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.670
To get information
or to give it.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.171
Well, it's also possible
to kill someone

08:58.205 --> 09:01.642
with a cotton ball,
but highly unlikely.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.080
You can take that to mean my
colleague doesn't agree with me.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.849
You're dismissed,
Lieutenant.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.091
Thank you.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.860
I'm in this now, too.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.095
I heard they
pulled you in.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.131
I don't know why they're
riding us so hard on this one.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.166
We need to go someplace
we can really talk.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.939
Leaning into my unit like this
is a waste of time.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.007
What you should be working
on is finding Sergeant Kam,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.242
and now that
Goundry's dead,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.977
we have absolutely no leads.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.012
Rest assured, Colonel, the
Agency is working on leads.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.281
Gathering intelligence
is not your area.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.250
Hey, I lost a
soldier out there.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.819
I do not intend to just
sit around and wait.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.320
I need to know exactly
what you're doing.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.189
We're going to dig
into the phone call

09:49.222 --> 09:50.791
between Sergeant
and Mrs. Kam

09:50.824 --> 09:53.160
to see if we can find
any clues to his location.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.995
Sergeant Kam said
Khalid sent uranium

09:55.028 --> 09:57.164
to an associate
in the U.S., or a bomb.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.666
Have you been able
to corroborate that?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.200
THEA:
No,

10:00.233 --> 10:02.069
but we have a team scanning
chatter intercepts

10:02.102 --> 10:03.036
for anything useful.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.838
We need more.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.339
We have our best people working
on it around the clock.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.808
Well, you damn
well better, because

10:07.841 --> 10:09.009
we are running
out of time here.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.217
He's right.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
Nora, I just
lied for you.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.222
Could put both
of our careers on the line.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.724
I never wanted that.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.092
Well, you need
to come clean now.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.393
Have faith
in the system.
How can I?

10:26.426 --> 10:27.995
They lied to us about
who the prisoner was,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.196
then Richard tried
to kill him.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.898
They're hiding
something.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.199
That is the CIA,
not the Army.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.067
We can't come clean
until we have answers.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.937
That's what Gallo and I have
been trying to do all this time.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.046
Thea thinks that something
is off, too.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.948
She doesn't believe
that Goundry was a bad guy.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.251
Good! That means
we're on the same side.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.087
Yeah, it does not change
the fact that you killed a man

10:54.121 --> 10:55.322
and covered it up.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.257
Whose side are you on, Ian?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.394
I'm not gonna turn you in.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.964
I couldn't
do that to you.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.332
Even though it goes
against everything

11:05.365 --> 11:07.467
that I've been trained to do
as a soldier.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.770
But I feel
like I don't know

11:09.803 --> 11:11.404
who you are anymore,
and I need to figure out

11:11.438 --> 11:13.741
what to do with that.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.020
I'm glad you had
time for a bite.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.257
Yeah, I had to step away,
clear my head.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.361
This operation's
at a standstill.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
You can't blame yourself.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.200
I need to be able to look
my people in the eye, Mae.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.435
To give Jess Kam some answers.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.372
But instead she's left the base,
gone to stay with her parents.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.841
The word's gotten out
that she was the leaker.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.209
Yeah, I know.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.211
People are gonna be
angry about that.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.013
Times like this,
I should be the one

11:53.046 --> 11:54.214
bringing this community
together.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.249
And you do.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.285
But the Army's changed
since you started.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.853
Now it's all about

11:59.887 --> 12:01.221
covert ops,

12:01.254 --> 12:05.292
intel gathering, CIA calling
the shots half the time.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.961
Can't tell you how many times
I've heard you say that.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.963
Yeah.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.800
It's a new world.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.037
I'm just not sure
what I add to it anymore.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.342
You know, you used to say
that you'd retire

12:22.375 --> 12:24.544
after 20 years in the service.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.280
It's been 23.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.453
I was the one who always told
my unit "Never give up."

12:33.486 --> 12:35.088
* All these times
will change... *

12:35.122 --> 12:37.791
But once we're through
this operation...

12:38.992 --> 12:40.994
...maybe it's time.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.468
Hey.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.470
I have been trying
to reach you all day.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.806
I've been dealing with things.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.474
He hold to our story?
In the room with him?

12:54.507 --> 12:55.876
Of course.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.211
Is that why
you wanted to see me?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.847
To ask me that?
No.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.215
I got something to show you.
Come on.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.116
Wait.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.419
I told Ian.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.554
You told him...

13:07.587 --> 13:09.089
Everything we've been hiding.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.258
Are you out of your mind?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.359
I couldn't keep it
from him anymore.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.561
We have been in this together
since the beginning.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.898
You know how many times
I've covered your ass.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.032
N-N-Now you just tell him.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.133
Just like that.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.937
Oh, Nora.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.305
So, what?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.074
What did he say?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.042
He was shocked.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.243
Yeah. I'll bet.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.912
Is he gonna turn us in?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.247
No.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.150
I wouldn't
have told him

13:37.184 --> 13:39.386
if I didn't think we'd made
the right choice over there.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.090
But now we really need proof.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.457
That's why I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

13:44.491 --> 13:48.228
Goundry's sister
brought me something.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.363
She said it'd have
the answers we need.

13:57.337 --> 14:02.075
If you're watching this,
it means that I'm dead.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.047
But I don't want
the truth to die with me.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.850
So I need you
to listen carefully.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.356
You dodge the hide
of the indigo elephant.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.526
Jeep drive against the jewel.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.031
Face the music.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.501
Yeah.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.237
It's about where I am
15 viewings in, too.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.339
MADANI:
It's obviously a code.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.640
I geeked out over this stuff
in training.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.443
Me, too, me, too,
but I'm coming up dry here.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.345
Look.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.048
Goundry knew where
Khalid's safe houses are,

14:41.081 --> 14:42.682
where Jimmy is,

14:42.715 --> 14:45.953
and a whole lot more
that could clear our asses,

14:45.986 --> 14:50.223
but how is any of that in here?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.558
He wanted us to have it.
He must have thought

14:51.591 --> 14:52.926
that we could crack it.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.527
Let's just watch it again.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.930
JIMMY:
Okay, since this is

14:56.964 --> 15:00.067
the last time I speak to you, I
want you to know that I love you

15:00.100 --> 15:01.568
and I forgive you
for everything.
JESS: Don't say that.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.403
JIMMY:
And tell Max he's my big guy.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.039
Always.
: Jimmy.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.508
Jimmy!

15:11.311 --> 15:12.579
Imagine thinking
that's the last time

15:12.612 --> 15:14.347
you might hear someone's voice.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.117
I'm sorry?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.652
That's what they're going
through, sir.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.589
Definition of tragic.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.192
But, frankly, Porter, I haven't
heard a word they've said,

15:25.225 --> 15:26.526
and neither should you.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.396
Listen to the background.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.399
Tell me
what you hear.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
...I want you to know
that I love you,

15:34.467 --> 15:36.403
and I forgive you
for everything.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.371
Don't say that.
And tell Max he's my big guy.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.373
Always.
Jimmy.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.375
Jimmy!

15:42.409 --> 15:45.345
Almost nothing. A...

15:46.413 --> 15:48.315
Like it's a soundproof room?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.516
There's an echo.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.384
Slight one.

15:51.418 --> 15:55.255
Maybe...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
I guess, concrete walls?

15:58.425 --> 16:01.394
Let's listen to it again.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.764
Okay, since this is
the last time I speak to you,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.300
I want you to know
that I love you...

16:07.334 --> 16:10.303
There's a supply run
this week to Kandahar.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.172
A bunch of us
are trying to get on.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.473
It'd be fun.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.607
Get the hell out
of here for a day.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.443
When?
Wednesday.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.445
Right. Um...

16:18.478 --> 16:21.014
Yeah, I don't know. I was
thinking about laying low.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.450
Seriously? There's
a movie theater there.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.186
Yeah, the movie might be
two years old, but who cares?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
Air conditioning,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.156
popcorn.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.157
We can make out like teenagers.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.426
Well, that does sound
pretty good.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.096
I kind of like it on base
when it's quiet.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.098
You sure?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.033
Something else on your mind?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.669
You know, you can tell me.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.505
It's just...

16:45.538 --> 16:48.641
I am very particular
about my popcorn...

16:48.675 --> 16:50.310
Oh. Oh, okay.
Yeah.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.511
Okay. Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.
Yeah, so...

16:51.544 --> 16:53.046
Okay. Well,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.615
maybe I'll bring you back
some gummy worms.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.051
Oh.
Ooh. Hey.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.454
I want you to know I love you.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.522
I love you, too, babe.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.793
* Second moments long forgot.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.571
Head in the game, Porter.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.075
Face the music.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.777
I hate to say this,

17:24.811 --> 17:27.114
but we're not gonna figure it
out on our own.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.381
What happened
to Code Breaker McGee?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.382
This is next level.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.385
Well, maybe Ian can help.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.487
He's got a lot more
training in ciphers.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.156
He's busy working with Magnus.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.625
Plus, he doesn't exactly want
to hear from me right now.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.261
Fair enough.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.563
What about Thea?

17:43.596 --> 17:45.265
Thea?

17:45.298 --> 17:48.235
You mean Thea who we both lied
to this morning?

17:48.268 --> 17:51.138
She wants to prove Goundry
was good as much as we do.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.706
And she wants to prove
we're lying. Since day one.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.642
So we go to her,
we say what?

17:55.675 --> 17:57.644
"Hey, we never met the guy,
but this tape just...

17:57.677 --> 17:58.578
fell into our laps."

17:58.611 --> 18:00.613
Look, the way to crack this

18:00.647 --> 18:02.682
is to find someone
who knew Goundry well.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.384
Thea did.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.386
So why didn't he
give it to her, then?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.189
Because he didn't trust anyone
in the end, besides us.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.591
That's what he said.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.362
Now it's up to us
to decide who else to trust.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.574
MAN:
Sir.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.576
Here are the most recent
translations. Just came in.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.345
Thank you.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.451
What the...
Mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.287
New chatter intercepts.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.689
Yeah, but there's something
not right about this one.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.392
It reads like a Google
Translate on a bad day.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.594
Huh. We got
our top people on this.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.397
I know. Which is why

18:50.430 --> 18:51.698
I think it might
be a dialect issue

18:51.731 --> 18:54.767
or a rare variant of
Arabic, maybe. If it is

18:54.801 --> 18:56.403
and our guys
aren't getting it,

18:56.436 --> 18:58.671
we could be missing
a huge piece of this puzzle.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.640
We are in violent agreement,
but unless you magically speak

19:00.673 --> 19:02.542
this dialect...
Well, I think I might know
somebody who can help.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.710
Oh, look at you.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.645
Plan B. Swing away.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.679
But she is

19:06.713 --> 19:08.315
a civilian.
Even better.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.749
She won't know
what she's looking at.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.918
We'll have her sign an NDA,
put her in a sterile room.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.521
Well, I'll call her first
thing in the morning.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.523
Hate to break it
to you, Porter, but it is

19:16.556 --> 19:18.491
first thing
in the morning.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.694
Time flies
when you're having fun!

19:33.740 --> 19:35.708
Good morning, soldiers.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.411
Who doesn't like a little
fraternization for breakfast?

19:38.445 --> 19:39.946
Here I was hoping

19:39.979 --> 19:41.248
you brought doughnuts.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.817
Goundry told us
he had evidence

19:44.851 --> 19:47.854
to back his story
and where to find it.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.556
Why would he reveal that

19:49.589 --> 19:52.759
to the two of you if he'd
never met you before?

19:52.792 --> 19:53.860
Because he thought
he was about to die.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.563
And he was right.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.797
And is there a
reason you didn't

19:57.830 --> 19:59.799
bring this up, say,
I don't know,

19:59.832 --> 20:04.571
uh, yesterday when I asked you
directly about it?

20:04.604 --> 20:07.640
We didn't want to pull you into
this until we actually had it.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.442
Hmm.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
And we didn't want to bring it
up in front of Magnus.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.845
He doesn't
believe

20:12.879 --> 20:15.482
there's any way
Goundry could have been good.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.291
He is still my boss, and he will
need to be looped in on this.

20:26.426 --> 20:29.829
Once we're clear
on what we have.

20:35.802 --> 20:39.272
Thank you for coming on such
short notice, Professor Benning.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.673
Right this way.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.009
You can call me
Olivia, Lieutenant.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.413
After all, you're not
in one of my seminars.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.418
Wow. I-I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to allow me

20:51.451 --> 20:53.420
a moment to take
in my surroundings.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.656
Yeah, I guess
I'm just used to it.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.058
I hope I'm able to help.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.795
Is anything specific you're
looking for in these documents?

21:02.829 --> 21:04.864
Just the translation
would be helpful.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.867
Sir, this is Professor Benning.
Welcome.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.570
We have a room set aside for you
to go over the transcripts.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.004
I hope you understand

21:12.038 --> 21:13.973
that an officer will be in
there with you at all times.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.008
Obviously, this is classified.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.810
Understood.
Outstanding.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.879
Uh, Lieutenant Porter
here will set you up.

21:19.912 --> 21:23.049
That's the director
of special activities,

21:23.082 --> 21:24.384
Tucker Magnus?

21:24.417 --> 21:26.386
I'm aware. Why are you?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.821
I spent my career
studying Somalia.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.591
He's been involved in a lot
of the CIA's operations there.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.394
Not all of which I
agree with, I must say.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.863
I... I cannot
speak to that, ma'am.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.064
Understood.

21:38.097 --> 21:41.368
You do your job,
and I'll do mine.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.769
GOUNDRY:
You dodge

21:42.802 --> 21:45.738
the hide of the indigo elephant.

21:45.772 --> 21:49.509
Jeep drive against the jewel.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.078
Face the music.

21:55.081 --> 21:59.018
You weren't saving this,
were you?

21:59.051 --> 22:00.920
I think that's been here
for at least three weeks.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.456
How often are you here,
Ms. Madani?

22:03.490 --> 22:04.791
More than you, I guess.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.826
What, you guys
always use your place?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.863
Is there anything
you two don't tell each other?

22:10.897 --> 22:12.632
Okay, so, if I'm right,

22:12.665 --> 22:13.900
Goundry is using

22:13.933 --> 22:15.935
an advanced CIA cipher
in this video.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.704
Can you run it again?

22:18.905 --> 22:19.572
GOUNDRY:
You dodge

22:19.606 --> 22:23.009
the hide of the indigo elephant.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.777
Jeep drive

22:24.811 --> 22:26.012
against the jewel.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.681
Pause it.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.717
Rewind it.

22:32.419 --> 22:33.786
You dodge the hide

22:33.820 --> 22:35.121
of the indigo elephant.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.425
Jeep drive against the jewel.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.694
Face the music.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.363
Play it again.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.833
Face the music.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.134
Again.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.140
Are you sure

22:54.173 --> 22:57.810
you're not just making stuff up
so it looks pretty?

22:57.844 --> 23:00.146
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.615
Would you like to crack this
on your own, or...?

23:02.649 --> 23:05.952
No. No, just keep on
Zuckerberging.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.920
Thank you.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.132
That was quite fun, actually.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.835
It's a fairly rare
Iraqi dialect.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.505
One speaker is native,
the other clearly isn't.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.906
That's good to know. Thank you.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.141
Yes, though, I have to say

23:29.175 --> 23:30.943
I'm not sure what's
said's very significant.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.945
We shall see.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.682
Lieutenant Porter,
this is your contact?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.484
Yes, sir. She's given us

23:37.517 --> 23:38.985
a new translation
on the chatter.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.219
Could be helpful.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.921
You're welcome
to take a look, Colonel,

23:41.954 --> 23:42.889
when you have time.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.924
Porter,

23:44.957 --> 23:46.959
uh, when you are through here,

23:46.993 --> 23:49.929
I would like to get back
to that other thing.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.998
Also, I need a snack.
You know, I was thinking

23:52.031 --> 23:53.700
something savory, but truly,

23:53.733 --> 23:55.968
it might be time
for something sweet.

23:57.970 --> 23:58.971
You?

23:59.005 --> 24:02.675
I'm... good, sir.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.443
Okay.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.551
Thank you again, Professor.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.152
Olivia.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.188
Olivia.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.058
Please, let me know

24:19.091 --> 24:20.593
if you ever need anything else.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.637
Hmm.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.140
Seriously?

24:34.173 --> 24:37.009
Yeah, I-I have high confidence
that I decoded that correctly.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.045
Thank you.
Three sets of numbers,

24:39.078 --> 24:40.613
first two have decimal points.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.782
First two are coordinates.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.216
Latitude and longitude.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.219
Okay, we got options

24:47.253 --> 24:49.055
depending on the order.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.090
One's in Greenland.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.024
Ooh, yeah.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.259
I had a bit of a situation

24:53.292 --> 24:56.095
there back in 2015,

24:56.128 --> 24:58.765
but I will totally go back
if we need to.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.569
Okay. Uh, the other one's
30 miles away.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.903
That makes more sense.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.672
It's either

25:05.705 --> 25:09.208
a storage unit
or a dumpling house.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.677
What about

25:10.710 --> 25:12.812
these four numbers? 5242.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.747
Well, if it's
a storage facility,

25:14.781 --> 25:15.948
could be the unit number.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.754
Hold up.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.222
We're not all gonna fit
in your truck.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.825
I hate the kickback in your car.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.760
No, it's fine. I'll drive.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.028
Can I pick the music?

25:29.061 --> 25:30.763
No.
No.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.165
Madani, you're shotgun.
Gallo, you're in the back.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
Nice parking job.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.068
Nice landscaping.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.302
Lieutenant.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.672
Look through these with me.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.173
I went further back

26:14.206 --> 26:16.242
to before the initial mission,
and I found a pattern.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.645
You think there's something
relevant, sir, this far back?

26:18.678 --> 26:20.112
I think we decide
what's relevant.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.118
You got a key
or some form of I.D.?

26:26.152 --> 26:27.654
Yeah, I've got this.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.255
It's a matter of
national security.

26:29.288 --> 26:33.025
Okay, 5242.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.234
Eh, it's stuck.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.873
Okay.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.678
Light's out.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.283
Well, this is
a whole new code to crack.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.219
How are we going to find
what we need in here?

27:00.252 --> 27:02.922
I knew Goundry.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.224
The cipher...

27:05.257 --> 27:07.193
this...

27:07.226 --> 27:09.829
he was a master
at the art of misdirect.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.363
It's in here somewhere.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.666
I'm glad you're amused.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.368
He was good. It's a shame.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.105
Has it occurred to anyone

27:19.138 --> 27:20.339
that we don't even know
what we're looking for?

27:21.808 --> 27:23.943
I'd say documents of some sort,

27:23.976 --> 27:25.945
a hard drive, maybe.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.980
We'll know it when we see it.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.149
Let's start digging.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.184
You're right, sir.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.753
These old transcripts of Khalid,

27:33.786 --> 27:35.021
there's a pattern to his speech,

27:35.054 --> 27:36.956
a reuse of certain phrases.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.291
And on this page
from today's chatter?

27:39.325 --> 27:40.960
Same patterns.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.963
This is Khalid talking
in the Iraqi dialect.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.798
And look who he's talking to.
An ISIS operative.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.433
And they're talking
about cake for red kite.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.301
Yeah, but what does that mean?
Red kite is a term

27:49.335 --> 27:51.337
I came across in
other chatter, too.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.973
It's a bird of prey
native to Iraq.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.208
In slang, it's often used
to mean "bomb," and "cake"

27:56.242 --> 27:57.343
is yellowcake.
Yellowcake.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.477
Uranium.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.412
That backs up

28:00.446 --> 28:01.781
what Jimmy said on the phone.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.016
Khalid has gotten uranium

28:04.050 --> 28:05.251
into this country,
and someone here

28:05.284 --> 28:06.953
is turning it into a weapon.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.254
I'll share this with Magnus.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.221
He needs to make
this top priority.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.124
Thank you for calling me in
on this, sir.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.726
You remind me

28:13.760 --> 28:15.327
of what Shadow Raiders
do best, Lieutenant.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.863
What's that?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.165
We don't quit.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.072
Greenland's looking pretty
good right about now.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.041
Do you really think
he'd bury it this deep?
It was crucial information

28:29.075 --> 28:31.343
he was trying to protect.
He had to be careful.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.213
Well, I'm whistling
up the wind here.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.817
Wait.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.952
He said "face the music."

28:39.986 --> 28:41.453
Right, which got us the number

28:41.487 --> 28:42.955
of this unit.
Right.

28:42.989 --> 28:43.990
But what if it meant more?

28:44.023 --> 28:45.491
I saw something.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.135
Here.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.305
Thanks.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.479
Well, I'll be damned.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.426
Okay, we've got something here.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.095
Looks like Goundry gathered

29:23.129 --> 29:24.530
everything that he could
on Khalid.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.564
There's got to be a list

29:25.597 --> 29:27.834
of safe houses
in here somewhere.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.768
This should lead us
to Sergeant Kam.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.279
Okay, so, Goundry did track
Khalid's safe houses,

29:40.312 --> 29:41.513
but there are five of them,

29:41.547 --> 29:42.514
so we still
have some work to do.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.550
Still, that's huge.

29:44.583 --> 29:45.952
There's also transcripts

29:45.985 --> 29:47.119
of a phone call.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.255
Khalid's on one side.
Who's on the other?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.389
Code name Matador.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.524
I have no idea who that is.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.227
Yeah, Goundry didn't
mention a matador.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.363
He did mention
snake eyes, though.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.265
Like the domino, maybe?

29:59.298 --> 30:00.900
Khalid had a domino
in that video.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.468
His negotiator had one, too.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.137
I don't know
what to tell you about that.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.409
Okay, we need
to take this to command,

30:10.442 --> 30:11.443
get more resources on it.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.980
We're in.

30:19.451 --> 30:20.586
MAE:
I didn't know

30:20.619 --> 30:22.488
you'd be home.
Hey, you.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.556
I can't stay.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.125
Just wanted to come

30:26.158 --> 30:27.326
lay my eyes on you.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.129
Well, you caught me

30:30.162 --> 30:33.165
in the middle of a deep dive
in real estate porn.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.467
Uh

30:35.501 --> 30:39.071
I'm just thinking
about things, places.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.007
Going to California,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.909
finding a place in SLO,

30:42.942 --> 30:44.443
driving a ridiculous car

30:44.476 --> 30:46.178
with the top down.
Mmm.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.447
Yeah, that sounds nice.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.650
Really nice.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.585
I miss California.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.854
Me, too.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.162
What is my work-around-
the-clock husband

31:03.195 --> 31:06.198
really doing home
in the middle of the day?

31:07.199 --> 31:10.069
I cracked something today, Mae.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.538
Something big.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.207
That's great.

31:15.241 --> 31:18.044
Working with Porter made
me realize there is still

31:18.077 --> 31:20.512
a lot of good I can do.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.915
Even in this new world.

31:22.949 --> 31:26.552
Well, I guess California
isn't going anywhere.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.558
I'm just not ready
to be done yet.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.528
And I keep thinking...

31:36.562 --> 31:39.431
if we bring
Sergeant Kam home...

31:39.465 --> 31:41.667
When you do.
...how can I look
him in the face

31:41.700 --> 31:44.403
and tell him I'm leaving?

31:45.437 --> 31:47.439
Hmm.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.278
But I still need to be able
to look you in the face.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.583
If you can tell me,
for a fact,

31:57.616 --> 32:00.619
that California
isn't going anywhere,

32:00.652 --> 32:04.556
I'll do my best
not to divorce you.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.996
I will put my
best soldiers

32:10.029 --> 32:13.099
on ensuring the stability
of California.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.570
I love you.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.540
I love you, too, baby.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.710
Thea set a meeting for 1500
to share what we found.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.678
Ian's gonna be there.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.248
We haven't
really talked since...

32:29.281 --> 32:31.250
Since you told him
everything?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.085
You're right.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.653
I should have
warned you first.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.689
I just needed to be done
with it-- all the lying.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.658
It's hard on me, too.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.228
Hey, what we found today--
it might be enough

32:42.261 --> 32:44.696
to prove that
Goundry wasn't bad.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.733
That we did the right
thing by saving him.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.368
We could come clean now.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.537
We'd be court-martialed.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.640
But we'd have a solid defense.
And we'd be off
the rescue mission.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.743
We have to get
Jimmy back first.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.011
We're so close.

32:59.045 --> 33:01.513
All right.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.582
But after we get him back,

33:03.615 --> 33:05.284
we get the truth out.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.753
Once and for all.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.756
Don't look at me like you're
waiting for my permission.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.391
You never do.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.172
Goundry's assignment
was to oversee the purchase

33:26.205 --> 33:28.174
and subsequent destruction
of black market uranium.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.508
When he discovered
that Khalid wasn't

33:29.541 --> 33:31.177
keeping his end of the bargain,

33:31.210 --> 33:34.046
and stockpiling the uranium
in safe houses instead,

33:34.080 --> 33:35.447
he started
documenting everything.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.748
MADANI:
He used a contact

33:36.782 --> 33:38.317
in the German intel service

33:38.350 --> 33:39.818
to access calls
from Khalid's phones.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.320
These are the transcripts.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.754
The man on the other end
used the name

33:42.788 --> 33:44.256
Matador.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.424
He and Khalid were making plans

33:45.457 --> 33:46.425
to sell the uranium

33:46.458 --> 33:47.793
to the highest bidder.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.695
A deal which would have made
both of them very rich.

33:49.728 --> 33:50.829
Ma'am, do we know

33:50.862 --> 33:52.164
who Matador is?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.166
Uh, no.
Yes.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.137
Matador is Officer Richard.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.073
THEA:
I'm sorry, what?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.341
I was never read in on that.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.809
You're not the only one.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.111
It was a higher-
clearance code name.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.345
Looks like he
made Goundry

34:06.378 --> 34:08.814
the fall guy.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.749
So Richard was the traitor,
not Goundry.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.251
He played us.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.585
You were right.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.221
Officer Thea,

34:15.254 --> 34:17.256
you were absolutely right.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.859
Now...

34:20.892 --> 34:23.829
...how about those safe houses?

34:23.862 --> 34:28.634
Uh, the documents list
five locations.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.436
GALLO: We just need
to find the right one.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.604
HASKINS: We can rule out the
hospital. After we raided it,

34:32.638 --> 34:34.706
no way Khalid would go back.

34:34.740 --> 34:35.774
Lieutenant Porter and I scoured
the audio

34:35.807 --> 34:37.276
from Sergeant Kam's call home.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.112
There was very little
ambient noise-- almost none--

34:40.146 --> 34:42.548
so that rules out
the Burco airstrip.
That's it.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.317
That's what
you're hearing: nothing.
Come again?

34:45.351 --> 34:47.219
There wasn't any ambient noise
because it's underground.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.856
This location is a Somali army
facility abandoned in the '90s.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.858
It has an underground bunker.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.626
Makes a lot of sense
as a hiding place.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.228
Yes, outstanding.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.230
We will start satellite
surveillance immediately.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.132
If we can place Khalid there,
it's highly likely

35:00.166 --> 35:01.733
Sergeant Kam is with him.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.669
He wouldn't let go
of an asset that valuable,

35:03.702 --> 35:04.836
not this late in the game.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.239
Get started on a mission plan.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.641
How we'd fly in,
how we'd fly out,

35:09.675 --> 35:12.344
and if he's there,
we'll have to move fast.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.380
Hooah.
Hooah.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.553
We're gonna get Jimmy this time.
I have a good feeling about it.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.854
So do we, sir.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.756
Let's choose
to trust in that.
Hell yeah.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.124
MAGNUS:
Nice work.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.860
On the bomb intel, too.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.197
Here I thought you got
all misty-eyed on me

35:31.230 --> 35:34.200
after listening
to that phone call.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.202
Not sure how it is
in the Agency,

35:36.235 --> 35:38.604
but soldiers don't get misty.

35:39.938 --> 35:43.275
I know how you lost
your dad, Porter.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.877
And I'm not gonna let something
like that happen under my watch.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.414
If there's a bomb out
there, we will find it.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.490
Hey.

36:01.727 --> 36:05.197
Colonel Krebs told me to
report at 0800. You, too?

36:05.231 --> 36:08.200
I asked him
to help me get you here.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.936
Wanted to surprise you.
You didn't go out
with the others today?

36:10.969 --> 36:12.371
Nope.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.639
Get in.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.607
Wait, you're flying?
Nuh-uh.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.943
Got us a couple of taxi drivers.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.946
Let's go.
Uh...

36:20.979 --> 36:23.215
Okay.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.740
Thought you had your
heart set on a movie.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.212
Ian, I know what today is.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.983
The 26th.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.751
I remembered.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.388
It's the day your father died
in the attack.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.993
I didn't want
to say anything.

37:08.026 --> 37:12.264
Why not? It's me.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.032
Because it is you.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.336
Because I care, because...

37:17.369 --> 37:19.671
our lives are hard
enough without

37:19.705 --> 37:22.341
me pulling you down with me.

37:22.374 --> 37:26.345
And I-I'm used to getting
through this day on my own.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.979
Isn't that the whole point
of being with someone--

37:28.013 --> 37:30.449
that you don't have
to get through this alone?

37:32.083 --> 37:33.585
I don't want you deciding

37:33.619 --> 37:36.488
what I can and cannot
handle with you.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.991
I'm all-in.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.698
And I promise
to fully burden you

37:46.732 --> 37:48.334
with all of my issues, too.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.369
Oh, you promise that?

37:50.402 --> 37:52.638
:
Yes.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.443
Now, I don't know

37:57.476 --> 37:59.978
what you're used to doing
stateside to honor your father,

38:00.011 --> 38:02.348
but since we're here,

38:02.381 --> 38:05.417
thought maybe we could
fly a flag for him.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.920
He would love that.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.397
* Let's skip the start

38:18.430 --> 38:21.400
* And tear apart

38:21.433 --> 38:24.436
* Like we were never lost

38:28.407 --> 38:30.409
* You'll tumble in my gaze

38:32.644 --> 38:35.414
* But you won't find
the answers *

38:35.447 --> 38:37.616
* We're together lost

38:39.485 --> 38:41.487
* We're forever lost

38:46.157 --> 38:49.795
* Between the lights
and the Anteros *

38:51.096 --> 38:52.831
* Where we live

38:52.864 --> 38:54.833
* And we laugh

38:54.866 --> 38:56.868
* And we lie.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.082
Hey.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.936
Just thinking about the day
we flew my father's flag.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.472
Afghanistan.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.674
I remember.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.444
You told me
that you were all-in.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.450
I meant it.

39:49.488 --> 39:52.924
I know that we went into this
with open hearts, but...

39:52.958 --> 39:56.428
it's changed.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.196
You've been lying to me

39:58.229 --> 40:00.966
for months now.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.067
I did it to protect you.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.439
Myself, too.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.609
Every day--

40:10.642 --> 40:12.210
when we went to bed,

40:12.243 --> 40:13.912
when we woke up--

40:13.945 --> 40:16.815
you decided not to tell me.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.786
And somewhere along the way,
I stopped being your person.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.221
All the important pieces
in your life--

40:23.254 --> 40:25.624
those real pieces-- they started
going to somebody else.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.158
You're right.

40:29.495 --> 40:32.464
When I told you the truth...

40:32.498 --> 40:36.468
I left out the most
important part.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.504
Apologizing.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.547
Ian, I don't know how
to make it up to you.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.551
I can try.
I can try every day.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.821
I just...
Mm. No, that's not

40:55.854 --> 40:58.524
what I want our relationship
to become. That...

40:58.557 --> 41:01.493
You trying to...
trying to win me,

41:01.527 --> 41:03.562
and-and me always trying
to not resent you--

41:03.595 --> 41:04.830
that's not what we should be.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.198
Then let's be who we are.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.072
I love you.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.477
I love you, too.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.749
But I cannot look at you

41:23.782 --> 41:26.752
without thinking
about all the lies

41:26.785 --> 41:28.253
that I've missed.

41:28.286 --> 41:31.489
We both deserve
better than that.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.264
I'm sorry.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.499
I can't do this anymore.
