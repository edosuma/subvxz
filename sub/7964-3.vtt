WEBVTT

00:11.800 --> 00:14.240
Nice. Nice, Sadie.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.320
Good. Good.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.720
Just under the beat.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.040
Lovely, darling.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.560
Rosey, keep your head up.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.360
Look at Sadie. Take note.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.280
I'm going to go backstage and get some shots, Nelson.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.480
Okay, Jay.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.000
Good, Sadie.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.920
Zoe, try to look as if you want to be here, yes?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.720
Well done. Better.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.280
Concentrate, now.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.400
Perfect, Eloise.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.920
Perfect.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.400
Let's just delay accepting, the Rome job's

00:45.960 --> 00:49.400
still a possibility.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.320
Hey, has anyone seen my laptop?

00:51.360 --> 00:52.480
It's where you last had it.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.320
Thanks, Jay.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.840
ROSEY: So, there's this great new place

00:55.880 --> 00:57.480
open up on the beach for after the show.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.400
Caribbean food, music.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.840
Yeah, I'd be well up for that. Sadie?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.920
I think I'm going to keep my head down.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.400
ZOE: Oh, come on, Sades.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.440
It's our last night on the island.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.440
It'll be fun.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.640
Sure, why not?

01:11.680 --> 01:13.520
NELSON: Right, right, right, right.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.320
Can I have your attention for a couple of minutes,

01:13.560 --> 01:16.320
please, ladies?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.600
Zoe, now.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.120
Right, just a few notes before tonight's show.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.480
Eloise.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.280
Just keep on doing exactly what you are doing.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.640
It's fantastic.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.440
Rosey, a little more confidence, darling.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.720
And Sadie, can you soften your turns a little, yes?

01:36.600 --> 01:40.920
Zoe, as always, you need to focus.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.480
Got it.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.400
You might wanna try slowing your

01:42.520 --> 01:44.400
walk a little, too.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.800
Let them enjoy you.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.240
Yeah, well, thanks, Eloise.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.120
NELSON: Jay.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.400
Yeah, just pretend I'm not there.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.760
NELSON: And that's it.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.760
One hour till showtime.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.080
Get some rest, get focused.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.080
And don't forget, be fabulous!

02:08.480 --> 02:10.040
Have a good time.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.440
Oh, I've forgotten my key, I'll catch up.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.120
NELSON:  This may not be

02:13.480 --> 02:15.120
important to you

02:15.160 --> 02:16.920
but it is everything to me.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.520
I didn't want you here in the first place

02:18.560 --> 02:22.000
but now you are here, you do as I say, yes?

02:22.040 --> 02:24.400
Step out of line again and...

02:24.440 --> 02:25.960
that is it.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.280
ANNOUNCER:<i> Good evening,</i> <i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

02:34.320 --> 02:36.520
<i>In aid of our local school,</i>

02:36.560 --> 02:39.360
<i>I present to you</i> <i>the stunning new line</i>

02:39.400 --> 02:44.240
<i>from Saint-Marie's</i> <i>favourite designer,</i>

02:39.400 --> 02:44.240
<i>Nelson Benedict.</i>

03:30.920 --> 03:32.040
Quickly, Zoe.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.600
Quickly!

03:33.640 --> 03:35.800
-Ready. -All right.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.040
That's it.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.040
Careful.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.240
Okay.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.320
Zoe, scarf.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.040
NELSON: One last one. ROSEY: I can't.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.560
-I don't believe it! -I'll sort it.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.760
How?

03:52.760 --> 03:54.240
Like this.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.360
Nelson, please.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.360
Agent. I need to take this. You can manage.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.480
Hi.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.360
Almost, just the shoes.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.560
ELOISE: Brilliant!

04:28.320 --> 04:30.040
NELSON: Superb.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.400
FLORENCE: Okay. So we said we'd talk

05:12.440 --> 05:15.760
and try to identify areas you think

05:12.440 --> 05:15.760
have room for improvement.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.240
Yes, vis-a-vis meeting members of the opposite sex.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.120
Well, actually, meeting them would be an area we

05:19.280 --> 05:22.120
could improve upon.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.320
-Easily remedied. -Talking.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.560
Finding the right subject?

05:25.600 --> 05:26.760
Constructing a sentence.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.160
You're talking now.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.920
Yes, but you're not a date.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.600
If you were, the nerves would kick in.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.600
The mouth would dry up.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.160
Throat would close and...

05:34.200 --> 05:35.560
Okay, well, we can work on that.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.160
Eating.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.840
What with the whole dry mouth and throat closed-up thing,

05:39.880 --> 05:41.640
food goes down in lumps.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.360
It's a wonder I've not needed the Heimlich

05:41.680 --> 05:43.360
manoeuvre before now.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.120
-And walking, legs like jelly...

05:43.400 --> 05:45.120
-Breathing's

05:45.160 --> 05:46.880
a bit of a problem. -It's Dwayne.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.080
Ah.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.880
Hello?

05:52.120 --> 05:53.760
On our way.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.920
Paradise Beach Hotel.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.160
-There's been a murder. -Let's go.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.560
So, JP, what have we got?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600
Earlier this evening, the hotel was

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600
hosting a fashion show. As it was about to finish,

06:08.640 --> 06:11.640
one of the models, Zoe Mackay, 19,

06:11.680 --> 06:12.880
was found dead in the marquee.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.320
She appears to have been strangled.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.600
HUMPHREY: And where are the other models now?

06:15.640 --> 06:18.320
The hotel. Dwayne's looking after them.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.520
Poor girl.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.240
A small amount of blood at the corner of her mouth,

06:30.280 --> 06:33.000
which would indicate death by asphyxiation.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.720
The ligature marks around the victim's neck

06:36.760 --> 06:38.920
would seem to confirm it.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.840
So what else do we know?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.880
The models took turns on the catwalk.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.520
Nelson helped them change.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.200
-The designer.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.680
Nelson Benedict. Should I know who he is?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.520
Originally from Saint-Marie,

06:52.560 --> 06:54.560
he left some years ago to find his fortune.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.520
He's fairly well-established.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.520
One of the models came off the catwalk

06:58.560 --> 07:00.360
and that's when Zoe was found dead.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.240
The other models and designer were here when she was killed

07:02.280 --> 07:04.560
and they're saying they didn't see anything?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.280
Could anyone from the audience have gained

07:04.600 --> 07:07.280
access and killed her?

07:07.320 --> 07:10.600
The area was fenced off and guarded by security.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.600
So security there.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.280
And there's a swamp there.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.400
Which means no one's getting in that way.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.280
And don't they normally have legions of people?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.840
Hair, makeup, that kind of thing?

07:25.880 --> 07:27.640
It was a charity event, sir.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.080
A fundraiser for Mr Benedict's old school.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.920
They wanted to keep costs to a minimum,

07:31.960 --> 07:34.720
so he and the models agreed they'd cover

07:31.960 --> 07:34.720
those jobs themselves.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.920
HUMPHREY: Right.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.800
Why is she holding this?

07:49.840 --> 07:54.160
She's a woman. Women wear these things.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.080
Will you be wanting to speak to the witnesses tonight, sir?

07:58.040 --> 07:59.240
What are you doing here?

08:03.200 --> 08:04.640
-Mmm.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.160
The witnesses.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.760
Yes, witnesses. Yes.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.120
Well, ladies, I thought you might appreciate this,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.120
after all you've been through.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.520
Keep your mind on the job, JP.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.240
Oh, it's just I think I know her.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.040
And I'm best friends with Naomi Campbell.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.200
Hello.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.960
Uh, thanks for coming at what I know is

08:30.240 --> 08:31.960
a difficult time.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.080
Let's start with introductions.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.120
I am Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman,

08:36.160 --> 08:38.040
DS Florence Cassell.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.800
Nelson Benedict, designer.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.760
I was hosting tonight's show.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.760
Jay Crocker, photographer.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.080
Sadie Mernier.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.320
Rosey Fabrice.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.800
Eloise Ronson.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.800
Thank you. So can I ask, um,

08:54.840 --> 08:56.760
which of you was it discovered Zoe?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.080
It was me.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.800
<i>As she came off the catwalk,</i> <i>I went on.</i>

09:00.840 --> 09:02.360
<i>Did my walk.</i>

09:02.400 --> 09:04.080
Returned and...

09:06.320 --> 09:08.640
Yes, and how long were you on the, um...

09:08.680 --> 09:09.680
The...

09:11.040 --> 09:14.360
Less than a minute, 40 seconds or so.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.840
Jay, you were out front, I assume?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.240
Yeah, taking shots of the girls.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.000
Did you see anyone acting suspiciously,

09:19.040 --> 09:20.640
anyone trying to get past security?

09:20.680 --> 09:24.480
No, but my attention was really on

09:20.680 --> 09:24.480
the catwalk so...

09:24.520 --> 09:26.240
And that was the camera you were using?

09:26.280 --> 09:27.880
Yep, it's got the entire show on it.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.000
We'll need the memory card.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.360
Sure.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.920
Here you go.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.200
Thank you.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.000
So, apart from Jay and Rosey,

09:44.040 --> 09:46.840
everyone else was in the marquee

09:44.040 --> 09:46.840
when this happened.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.120
Miss Ronson, what were you doing?

09:51.160 --> 09:53.840
She was supposed to be helping me

09:51.160 --> 09:53.840
get Sadie into her dress.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.520
What, you need two people to get someone into a dress?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.320
It's quite intricate.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.680
Ties at the back.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.920
The highlight of my show.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.440
I was outside taking a call from my agent.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.160
Is that usual during a show? Not in my experience.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.560
HUMPHREY: Did anyone see you outside?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.200
I certainly heard her.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.240
Oh, that's brilliant! Well,

10:19.240 --> 10:22.240
I fly out of here tomorrow

10:22.280 --> 10:24.720
so I can be there by Thursday.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.040
My agent's number. Call her and check.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.840
We will, thank you.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.800
So, Eloise taking a call, Nelson and Sadie in

10:30.680 --> 10:33.800
the changing area,

10:33.840 --> 10:37.320
Rosey on the catwalk, Jay out front

10:33.840 --> 10:37.320
taking photographs.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.840
What happened after Zoe was discovered?

10:39.880 --> 10:42.400
I rushed out,

10:42.440 --> 10:45.640
asked if there was a doctor present but...

10:45.680 --> 10:48.840
And the scarf that was used to killed Zoe?

10:48.880 --> 10:51.440
Part of her outfit.

10:51.480 --> 10:55.280
Can you think of a reason someone might

10:51.480 --> 10:55.280
have to hurt her?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.480
Has she fallen out with anyone since she's been here?

10:58.520 --> 11:02.960
We flew in two days ago and all we've done

10:58.520 --> 11:02.960
is sleep and work.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.920
She didn't have time to meet with anyone else.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.880
There was something, you know.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.120
Um, I'd heard a little bit from Zoe

11:11.160 --> 11:13.520
myself but Sadie, you knew her best.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.720
Zoe had some kind of a stalker.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.840
He found out where she lived. Starting sending her letters.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.520
It's been going on for a couple of months now.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.360
Did she know who it was?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.160
No, she notified the police but I don't think

11:31.400 --> 11:34.160
anything came of it.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.720
Police

11:35.760 --> 11:38.320
We all get strange letters, it comes with the territory.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.120
I think these were a bit different.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.320
We'll need to get in touch with the UK police,

11:43.360 --> 11:44.800
get hold of that case file.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.560
All right, that's all for now. Thank you very much.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.440
Um, if you think of anything else,

11:46.600 --> 11:49.440
then please do tell us.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.160
Oh, Mr Benedict,

11:52.200 --> 11:56.240
Zoe was found holding a stocking.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.240
Part of your collection?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.440
Stockings? No.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.280
Just thought I'd ask.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.800
Thank you.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.080
Good morning.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.400
Good morning, number two.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.120
So, this, uh, this stalker thing,

12:55.160 --> 12:56.640
I called the police in Blackpool.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.040
-Yes.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.000
A big tower, donkeys, kiss-me-quick hats.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.320
Kiss your what?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.720
Like a trilby, you know. Uh, no, why would you?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.960
Well, Blackpool is Zoe's hometown in the UK.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.560
Anyway, they sent over copies of the letters

13:07.000 --> 13:10.560
from the stalker.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.720
Uh, here we go.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.360
"I watch you every day,

13:16.400 --> 13:19.440
"dreaming of us together forever,

13:16.400 --> 13:19.440
never apart."

13:20.880 --> 13:22.520
Nothing threatening.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.840
You know, it reads rather like a sort of creepy fan-mail.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.560
He's clearly obsessed.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.200
Yes, but if that is the case,

13:28.240 --> 13:30.200
why travel all the way here to kill her?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.640
So the stalker isn't our killer?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.600
Well, we can't dismiss them entirely.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.640
But I can't help feeling

13:37.680 --> 13:41.840
that whoever sent those letters

13:37.680 --> 13:41.840
did not murder Zoe Mackay.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.440
-Yes.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.560
-Um... -Oh, gosh.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.200
Oh, yes. Thank you.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.240
Right.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.680
Come on.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.240
I'd like to take another look at this crime scene.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.280
Right, for the moment,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.360
let's discount the possibility that Zoe was

14:14.320 --> 14:16.360
killed by her stalker.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.000
Security were posted front of house

14:18.040 --> 14:19.720
and there's a large swamp at the back of the marquee,

14:19.760 --> 14:22.280
so I'm not sure how he could have

14:19.760 --> 14:22.280
managed to get inside.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.440
Also, if she's telling the truth,

14:24.480 --> 14:26.640
Eloise was taking a phone call at the time,

14:26.680 --> 14:29.280
so she would have seen if an intruder

14:26.680 --> 14:29.280
had got in that way.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.200
Which means that the killer had to be someone

14:31.240 --> 14:32.960
who was already backstage during the show.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.560
That rules out the photographer, Jay.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.240
He was out front taking photos.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.480
And security would have noticed

14:36.280 --> 14:38.480
if he'd gone backstage.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.480
So of all the four other suspects

14:40.520 --> 14:42.480
who were in the marquee during the fashion show...

14:42.520 --> 14:44.600
Rosey was on the catwalk,

14:44.640 --> 14:46.520
Sadie being dressed by Nelson,

14:46.560 --> 14:48.080
Eloise outside on the phone. Each of them has an alibi.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.760
So who killed Zoe?

14:52.920 --> 14:54.280
And how

15:02.000 --> 15:04.160
My cologne.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.920
Those models knows quality when they see it and smell it.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.040
Ah, Miss Fabrice.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.760
Please. Come in.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.160
How can I be of assistance?

15:35.200 --> 15:36.720
It's probably nothing

15:36.760 --> 15:38.760
but, uh, there's something I thought I should mention.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.280
Is it to do with Nelson?

15:41.320 --> 15:44.640
I saw you looking to him during

15:41.320 --> 15:44.640
the questioning last night.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.760
They didn't get on, Zoe and Nelson.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.080
He thought she lacked focus, never had her mind on the job.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.360
In what way?

15:53.400 --> 15:56.160
Zoe was always on her laptop or texting.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.240
That's hardly a motive to kill her.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.320
Why did Nelson dislike her so much?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.760
Zoe and I worked with each other last year,

16:02.800 --> 16:04.600
on another of Nelson's shows.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.560
First day, she turned up still drunk

16:04.640 --> 16:08.560
from the previous night,

16:08.600 --> 16:10.600
didn't do too well on the catwalk.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.680
He was furious.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.440
Still drunk?

16:13.480 --> 16:16.800
She realised her mistake, forever

16:13.480 --> 16:16.800
apologising to Nelson but...

16:16.840 --> 16:18.240
He never forgave her.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.840
From the moment we arrived he was at Zoe,

16:20.880 --> 16:22.560
criticising her every move.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.880
NELSON: You do as I say, yes?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.640
Step out of line again and...

16:26.680 --> 16:29.240
This is your last chance, you understand?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.800
And later, during the show...

16:32.840 --> 16:34.320
NELSON: I don't believe it!

16:34.360 --> 16:37.280
ROSEY:<i> I thought he was</i> <i>going to lose it again.</i>

16:37.320 --> 16:40.440
Hey, um, you were right to let us know.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.760
Thank you.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.280
Like my junior colleague said, you did the right thing.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.200
Thank you very much.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.240
Ah, gosh,<i> mademoiselle.</i>

16:58.760 --> 17:00.320
Wow.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.760
Look at that.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.000
The whole fashion show played out frame-by-frame.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
-Brilliant work, JP. -Thank you, sir.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.680
What did Miss Fabrice want?

17:07.720 --> 17:10.400
She came to tell us that Nelson had a few

17:07.720 --> 17:10.400
run-ins with Zoe.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.360
One at a fashion show last year,

17:12.400 --> 17:14.680
and he's lost it a few times since they arrived here.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.200
Which is interesting,

17:16.240 --> 17:17.840
because there's a charge of

17:16.240 --> 17:17.840
assault on his record.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.280
I've asked the police in Paris to send over the files.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.560
Also, Rosey mentioned that Zoe had a laptop.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.960
It wasn't at the marquee.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.400
Yes, we'll need to search her room at the hotel,

17:26.440 --> 17:27.600
see if it turns up there.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.400
Right, so, background checks.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.480
Our victim, Zoe Mackay.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.880
Nineteen years old, from Blackpool, UK.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.920
Left school at 16 after being

17:35.920 --> 17:38.920
spotted by a talent scout

17:38.960 --> 17:40.800
from Bounce modelling agency.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.920
Our suspects, Nelson Benedict.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.480
DWAYNE: Born Saint-Marie

17:45.520 --> 17:47.840
but left for London at the age of 18

17:45.520 --> 17:47.840
to study fashion.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.600
He's returned to host a charity

17:47.880 --> 17:50.600
fundraising fashion show

17:50.640 --> 17:53.760
and used Rosey Fabrice and Sadie Mernier as models.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.600
Both island girls.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.360
Good. Eloise Ronson.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.440
Twenty-four years old, from London.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.960
She's been modelling since she was 15

18:01.000 --> 18:02.440
and is well-known on the circuit.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.640
She's the face of a high street clothing chain

18:04.680 --> 18:07.000
and an international cosmetics range.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.200
Rosey Fabrice.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.520
Twenty-three.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.840
Born and raised in Chapel Town, Saint-Marie.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.760
Won a scholarship to Saint Francis,

18:11.880 --> 18:15.760
where she was a model student.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.800
That was a deliberate pun, right?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.320
Wrong.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.240
At college, as part of her final exams,

18:25.280 --> 18:28.000
she choreographed and performed a new work

18:28.040 --> 18:31.480
using local musicians, focusing on

18:28.040 --> 18:31.480
the island's history.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.520
And you know that how?

18:34.560 --> 18:36.400
She was in the year above me at school.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.320
Hey, I thought you was making that up.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.200
So how come she didn't mention she knew you when she came in?

18:42.240 --> 18:43.760
Mmm.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.520
Obviously, you made a huge impact.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.760
Anyway, what was your impression of her?

18:49.800 --> 18:52.640
Good family, friendly, easygoing.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.880
Sadie Mernier.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.160
JP: From Saint-Marie. Now based in Manchester.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.600
Good friends with Zoe.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.720
HUMPHREY: Okay.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.360
So, Zoe was killed within less than

19:01.760 --> 19:04.360
a 60-second time frame

19:04.400 --> 19:05.720
between leaving the runway

19:05.760 --> 19:08.160
and then being discovered by Rosey Fabrice.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.520
But all of our suspects have alibis.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.400
Nelson and Sadie were busy changing.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.640
Eloise on the phone.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.040
Rosey was on stage.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.560
So who had the most opportunity

19:16.080 --> 19:18.560
to kill Zoe?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.520
Because everybody else was in someone else's sight.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.920
So prime suspect, Eloise.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.560
Unless... Let's play What If.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.000
What if Nelson and Sadie are on this together?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.720
One of them kills Zoe, each giving

19:33.040 --> 19:35.720
the other an alibi.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.200
Mmm-hmm.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.800
What if Eloise hadn't taken the call from her agent?

19:40.840 --> 19:42.320
They wouldn't have been left alone.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.520
JP, want to talk us through?

19:45.560 --> 19:51.560
Over 500 frames from Jay's memory card

19:45.560 --> 19:51.560
taken during the show.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.560
There's even more of the rehearsals

19:51.600 --> 19:54.560
and backstage.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.160
Jay started taking photographs on the left side

19:54.600 --> 19:58.160
of the catwalk,

19:58.200 --> 20:02.760
moving round and ending up on the right side here.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.120
The frames run chronologically starting at 7:00,

20:06.160 --> 20:09.320
with Eloise being the first model

20:06.160 --> 20:09.320
on the runway,

20:09.360 --> 20:13.480
through to this frame taken at 7:25,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.480
by which time the models had appeared 10 times each.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.840
And every time in a new outfit.

20:18.880 --> 20:24.080
Going through the time codes, from 19:23:02

20:24.120 --> 20:27.360
to 19:23:50,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.280
Zoe doing her thing.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.360
The most significant frame for us

20:29.320 --> 20:33.360
is this one here, 19:23:57,

20:33.400 --> 20:36.760
Zoe leaving for the last time as Rosey begins

20:33.400 --> 20:36.760
her final walk.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.120
That's the last shot of Zoe before she died.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.400
Honore Police.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.520
19:23:59

20:51.560 --> 20:54.520
to 19:24:40,

20:54.560 --> 20:56.760
Rosey making her last appearance.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.600
And timecode 19:24:44, we see her

20:56.800 --> 21:01.600
entering the marquee.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.640
Uh, 47 seconds after Zoe left the catwalk,

21:04.680 --> 21:06.400
Rosey finds her dead.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.520
Which all the suspects say is correct,

21:06.440 --> 21:08.520
because here,

21:08.560 --> 21:14.240
timecodes 19:25:04 to 19:25:09,

21:08.560 --> 21:14.240
after we last saw Rosey...

21:14.280 --> 21:17.760
Nelson appears on the catwalk asking if there's

21:14.280 --> 21:17.760
a doctor in the house,

21:17.800 --> 21:19.320
which was the last picture Jay took.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.640
DWAYNE: Thank you very much.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.040
That was our colleagues in Paris

21:22.080 --> 21:23.680
in regard to Nelson's arrest for assault.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.400
It was during a fashion show he was mounting.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.720
And get this, the person assaulted

21:26.760 --> 21:28.040
was one of his models.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.480
She turned up late. He got physical.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.240
-DWAYNE: Tiny.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.720
They also said it wasn't the first time

21:33.760 --> 21:35.480
the police had attended one of his shows.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.680
Apparently, the man has some serious anger issues.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.520
Well, let's go and see what he has to

21:38.720 --> 21:40.520
say for himself.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.080
Uh, Dwayne, JP,

21:43.120 --> 21:44.480
whilst we're grappling with Nelson,

21:44.520 --> 21:46.040
I want you to search Zoe's room,

21:46.080 --> 21:47.920
see what you can find. Oh, and great work, everyone.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.120
-Yes, Chief.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.640
What is that smell?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.680
So how come you didn't tell me before

21:59.720 --> 22:01.320
you went to school with a model?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.800
'Cause she wasn't a model then.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.160
Any news, officers?

22:04.200 --> 22:06.080
Uh, none at the moment.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.240
But I'm very hopeful.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.040
I have a job booked in Rome at the end of the week.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.760
I'll still be able to make it, won't I?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.480
Well, we've established a timeline...

22:13.520 --> 22:16.480
The investigation's ongoing. There's nothing to report yet.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.400
DWAYNE: What was that all about?

22:24.440 --> 22:28.160
These women have been traumatised.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.160
They need handling gently.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.560
I'm just trying to stay focused, Dwayne.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.080
I mean, one of them could be our killer.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.800
Okay. You're right.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.960
One of them could be.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.720
What about the other two, eh?

22:39.760 --> 22:41.080
Mmm?

22:48.360 --> 22:53.480
A light<i> petit dejeuner</i> for me, an early lunch for you,

22:53.520 --> 22:54.720
if you'd care.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.040
Well, that's very kind, but no.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.240
A little tea.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.680
Thank you.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.000
Yeah, I can't imagine what it must be like

23:03.040 --> 23:04.520
in your line of business.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.240
-I mean, the adrenaline must be...

23:04.560 --> 23:06.240
-That is<i> cafe.</i>

23:06.280 --> 23:07.600
Oh, gosh. Yes, of course.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.880
-Um... -Let me.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.360
Yes.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.960
Thank you.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.560
It's these sky-high

23:12.000 --> 23:14.560
adrenaline levels.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.840
Constantly on edge.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.840
It can be very tense.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.000
And the models,

23:22.040 --> 23:23.640
getting them to do what you want,

23:23.680 --> 23:25.200
when you want, the way you want.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.480
I try to keep a level head.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.920
Mmm-hmm.

23:27.960 --> 23:31.560
You didn't, though, on December 10, 2014, did you?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.320
Euro Fashion Week,

23:33.360 --> 23:35.960
when you assaulted one of your models,

23:33.360 --> 23:35.960
Doreen Hutton.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.160
Date's right, isn't it?

23:37.200 --> 23:38.480
Mmm-hmm.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.360
There are other incidents. Five, to be exact.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.560
The pressure gets to me sometimes.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.320
Like when Zoe turned up drunk to your show last year.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.960
Or when you were overheard shouting to her

23:47.360 --> 23:49.960
before this show,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.480
or when she ripped the dress before she stepped

23:50.000 --> 23:52.480
onto the catwalk.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.440
The incident with Doreen Hutton, unforgivable.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.240
The others were misunderstandings.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.160
Did the red mist descend again yesterday, Nelson

24:04.200 --> 24:06.480
Zoe not show you enough respect,

24:04.200 --> 24:06.480
that it?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.080
You lose your temper?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.520
Zoe had let me down before

24:09.560 --> 24:12.440
and I was letting her know in no uncertain terms

24:12.480 --> 24:14.000
not to let it happen again.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.200
The stupid girl, she didn't realise

24:14.040 --> 24:17.200
how lucky she was.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.360
Lucky?

24:19.400 --> 24:21.520
Zoe was handed it on a plate,

24:21.560 --> 24:24.680
given the kind of success others have fought

24:21.560 --> 24:24.680
years to achieve.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.760
I came from nothing.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.120
Fought tooth and nail to get where I am.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.080
That is why I'm so

24:30.160 --> 24:32.080
passionate about what I do

24:32.120 --> 24:36.600
and why sometimes I lose it when others

24:32.120 --> 24:36.600
don't feel the same.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.600
This is my life, DI Goodman.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.920
All I have.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.040
So how are you chaps getting on with the search?

24:47.080 --> 24:48.240
Anything of use?

24:48.280 --> 24:51.320
Well, Chief, we found Zoe's mobile.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.680
No threatening texts or answer-phone messages.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.240
But there was one thing. JP.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.800
Mobile phone number?

24:58.840 --> 25:00.040
It was in her dialled numbers log.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.800
She called that number two days ago

25:01.840 --> 25:03.720
and hasn't called it before or since

25:01.840 --> 25:03.720
as far as we can tell.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.800
Can you trace it?

25:04.840 --> 25:06.440
Pay as you go.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.000
We called it ourselves but it keeps

25:06.480 --> 25:08.000
going to voicemail.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.560
So it doesn't belong to any of the suspects?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.360
Intriguing. Keep trying, Dwayne.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.040
You never know, they may pick up.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.160
There wasn't any sighting of the other stocking, was there?

25:16.200 --> 25:18.160
These things normally come as a pair,

25:16.200 --> 25:18.160
I believe.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.440
No, sir.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.240
And Zoe's laptop hasn't turned up, either.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.040
HUMPHREY: So maybe our killer took it.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.840
If so, why

25:24.880 --> 25:26.240
Have a word with the hotel staff,

25:26.280 --> 25:27.560
ask them to keep their eyes peeled.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.120
Should I apply for a search warrant, sir?

25:30.160 --> 25:32.440
No, that'll take forever, JP.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.760
So, um,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.280
let's try a different approach.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.600
Sorry to disturb you, Miss Mernier.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.600
This isn't...

25:41.640 --> 25:43.160
...an official request as I don't have...

25:43.200 --> 25:44.520
...the necessary warrant.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.400
But I wondered if you wouldn't mind me...

25:46.440 --> 25:49.600
...me searching your room? It's part of our

25:46.440 --> 25:49.600
ongoing investigation.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.360
And although I could get a warrant,

25:49.640 --> 25:51.360
it could...

25:51.400 --> 25:52.560
...take some time.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.360
And it would be better all round

25:54.400 --> 25:56.280
if we could eliminate you from our enquiries

25:54.400 --> 25:56.280
as soon as we can.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.520
-Thanks. -Thanks.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.800
-Thanks very much. -Very much.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.000
Very much.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.840
Would it be possible to come in?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.160
Tell me what it is and I'll tell

26:04.880 --> 26:07.160
you if it's there.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.360
It's confidential.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.920
But if I let you in and you find it,

26:09.960 --> 26:11.440
I'll see it and know what it is.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.200
So why don't you just tell me what you're looking for

26:13.240 --> 26:14.680
and I can tell you if I have it.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.840
Look, it might have been stolen...

26:16.880 --> 26:18.000
Are you calling me a thief?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.400
No.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.080
Well, then you have no need to search my room.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.800
-DWAYNE: Chief. -Yes.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.200
Eloise is hiding something, I can feel it in my water.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.840
She has the weakest alibi, she's our prime suspect.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.960
No luck with Zoe's laptop.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.480
But they did say that yesterday morning

26:35.520 --> 26:37.920
Eloise had requested to be given her own room.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.720
She and Zoe had been sharing.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.000
They'd fallen out over something?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.840
FLORENCE: Putting it mildly.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.240
Eloise told the receptionist she didn't want to

26:42.880 --> 26:45.240
stay another night

26:45.280 --> 26:48.640
in the same room as "that interfering bitch".

26:48.680 --> 26:50.200
How charming.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.800
So Eloise requests a room on her own,

26:50.240 --> 26:52.800
Zoe is murdered,

26:52.840 --> 26:54.400
and now she's refusing a search.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.400
JP, get to court. Get a warrant, please.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.560
-Yes, Chief. -Dwayne, keep an eye

26:56.440 --> 26:58.560
on Eloise.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.440
Don't worry, Chief. I won't let her

26:58.600 --> 27:00.440
out of my sight.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.160
Yes, of that I have no doubt.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.040
FLORENCE: Thank you.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.640
Eloise's agent's confirmed

27:06.680 --> 27:08.320
they were speaking at the time Zoe was murdered.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.320
We're still waiting for phone

27:08.360 --> 27:10.320
records to back it up.

27:10.360 --> 27:14.360
Thanks, Florence. So,

27:10.360 --> 27:14.360
security here, at the side.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.400
Swamp here, at the back.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.760
Catwalk here.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.920
And marquee, where Zoe was killed, here.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
At the time Zoe was murdered, Eloise was here,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.600
taking a call from her agent.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.040
Nelson and Sadie

27:31.080 --> 27:33.000
said they heard Eloise talking on the phone

27:33.040 --> 27:35.000
shortly before the body was discovered.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.840
Sadie was being dressed by Nelson,

27:35.040 --> 27:37.840
so they alibi each other.

27:37.880 --> 27:42.280
Okay. Rosey was on the catwalk at the time of the murder.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.400
Photographs taken by Jay prove this to be true.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.200
HUMPHREY: But even if we rule her out,

27:46.240 --> 27:49.640
I am at a complete loss as to how one of

27:46.240 --> 27:49.640
the other three

27:49.680 --> 27:52.200
-might have been able to do it, either.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.600
The post-mortem results have arrived.

27:53.640 --> 27:54.920
Ah. Good.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.200
DWAYNE: <i> JP.</i>

27:56.240 --> 27:57.680
I'll be waiting a while for that warrant.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.240
Court is closed for lunch.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.800
I can't stay all day.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.880
There are natural functions that need attending to.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.440
There's movement.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.440
Yes, confirm that.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.160
The target is on the move.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.840
The post-mortem's confirmed death by asphyxiation.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.920
The pressure exerted caused her

28:17.880 --> 28:20.920
windpipe to fracture.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.400
So she died quickly. Small mercies.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.280
Also, the lab has been unable to recover any fingerprints

28:26.320 --> 28:29.480
from either the stocking or the scarf.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.240
Ah, yes, the stocking.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.320
Satin noir stockings, 15 denier.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.120
Hardly notice I'm wearing them.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.360
Luxury I can afford, luxury I deserve.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.520
You do that a little too well.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.360
Oh, yes, quoting their advertisement.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.560
I know this is trying to tell us something.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.880
What exactly is it trying to say?

29:04.400 --> 29:05.920
I knew it.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.360
Available only on the black market,

29:19.400 --> 29:23.680
Camadathol is a fat-burning drug

29:19.400 --> 29:23.680
which enhances weight loss.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.880
According to this, it's widely used

29:23.720 --> 29:26.880
in the modelling world.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.080
Mmm. Illegal.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.680
"Anyone found in possession of the drug

29:29.720 --> 29:31.440
"could face a lengthy spell in prison."

29:31.480 --> 29:33.320
Which would explain why Eloise was reluctant for you

29:33.360 --> 29:35.000
-to search her room, Dwayne. -Mmm.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.920
Maybe that's why she wanted out of the room

29:36.960 --> 29:38.360
she was sharing with Zoe.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.240
Maybe Zoe had discovered the drugs.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.960
Eloise was under contract to more than one

29:40.280 --> 29:42.960
high street company,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.160
pushing her "girl next door" image.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.320
Which means if Zoe exposed her,

29:45.200 --> 29:48.320
she would lose everything.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.440
Time to pay her a visit.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.880
Zoe discovered you were using drugs,

29:58.680 --> 30:01.880
didn't she?

30:02.720 --> 30:04.760
We argued.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.760
Zoe said she was disgusted.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.240
<i>Said if word got out</i> <i>I was using these things,</i>

30:09.280 --> 30:12.120
<i>young girls might</i> <i>follow my example.</i>

30:12.160 --> 30:14.560
Did she threaten to expose you?

30:14.600 --> 30:16.160
As far as she was concerned,

30:16.200 --> 30:19.400
the dealers were the bad guys, I was one of the victims.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.160
Taking the drugs was wrong.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.360
But there are girls younger, slimmer.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.520
And if the client wants thin, they get thin.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.080
Where did you get the drugs from, Eloise?

30:33.280 --> 30:34.360
A guy in London.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.280
We need a name.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.600
No name, just a number.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.200
You send a text, a kid arrives on a bike,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.200
you pay the cash and don't ask questions.

30:43.240 --> 30:46.360
We'll need that number, if we may.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.800
I love my job more than

30:53.440 --> 30:55.800
anything in the world

30:55.840 --> 30:57.520
and I don't want to lose it.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.960
But I would never, ever have killed Zoe in

30:57.560 --> 31:00.960
order to keep it.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.280
I would never do that.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.720
Why is Zoe's diary in your room?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.480
So what's the deal with you and the model, Rosey?

31:17.640 --> 31:18.760
Uh, what do you mean?

31:18.800 --> 31:19.960
Spill the beans, man.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.560
There's nothing to spill.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.480
All right.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.840
Uh...

31:27.880 --> 31:31.600
Yeah, I used to like her, along with every

31:27.880 --> 31:31.600
other boy in school.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.320
In her final year, the last day of term,

31:35.360 --> 31:37.200
I left her a flower on her desk.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
Oh, say it with flowers. Nice. Obviously said

31:39.280 --> 31:41.280
the wrong thing.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.120
I mean, I never saw her again.

31:43.160 --> 31:47.040
And when she came in today, she didn't know me from Adam.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.800
Zoe's diary. I'm going to

31:47.080 --> 31:49.800
work my way through,

31:49.840 --> 31:51.360
see if it throws anything up.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.200
JP, can you get onto the police in London?

31:53.240 --> 31:55.040
Pass them that number.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.440
Tell them that's the contact that Eloise was

31:55.080 --> 31:57.440
using to buy Camadathol.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.280
Uh, sir. Um, hang on.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.160
This is the number Zoe called from her mobile two days ago.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.560
She called Eloise's dealer?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.560
Zoe wasn't a user, was she?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.720
She told Eloise she hated drugs.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.000
News back from Zoe's internet server.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.640
Nothing much of interest.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.360
The usual email between her and her family back in the UK.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.440
But there was quite a bit of correspondence

32:18.480 --> 32:20.800
with a fashion magazine based in London.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.280
Turns out Zoe was writing an article

32:20.840 --> 32:24.280
called "Life in the Industry".

32:24.320 --> 32:26.240
That's probably why she was always on her laptop.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.280
Also, Eloise's phone records have come through

32:26.280 --> 32:29.280
and they check out.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.280
The call she said she received from her agent

32:31.320 --> 32:33.040
covers the time Zoe was murdered.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.000
So, Eloise's alibi stands. Let's go over what we've got.

32:37.040 --> 32:40.640
Nelson, furious regarding Zoe's previous behaviour.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.920
And Eloise, fearing that she'd be exposed

32:40.680 --> 32:43.920
as a drug user.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.920
No motives for the other suspects so far.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.360
Where are we with the financial checks?

32:47.400 --> 32:48.720
They'll be with us in the morning, sir.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.400
Also, we'll need to check out Zoe's social media profile,

32:52.440 --> 32:55.880
Facebook, the other one, the Tweeter.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.880
See if anything leaps out.

32:55.920 --> 33:01.400
Now, Zoe left the catwalk here.

32:55.920 --> 33:01.400
Less than a minute later,

33:01.440 --> 33:06.680
as Rosey entered the marquee here,

33:01.440 --> 33:06.680
she was found dead, strangled.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.520
Our killer has to be one of those four people

33:09.560 --> 33:12.720
who had access to the marquee during the fashion show.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.040
But they all have alibis.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.920
So how did one of them manage to kill her?

33:15.960 --> 33:18.080
Uh, sir, that was the hotel.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.640
They found a laptop, could be Zoe's.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.440
I could collect it on my way home?

33:22.480 --> 33:24.160
Fantastic. Absolutely brilliant, JP.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.200
Okay, let's leave it there for now.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.360
Sleep on things, back tomorrow bright-eyed and dare

33:26.240 --> 33:30.360
I say bushy-tailed.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.080
-Night, Chief. -Night-night.

33:33.120 --> 33:37.040
Um, Florence, uh, Catherine's bar,

33:33.120 --> 33:37.040
a drink, maybe?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.160
-Sure. -Good.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.200
JP: That's great. Thank you very much.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.240
You. It was you.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.080
Sadie, you are drunk. Go to bed.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.520
-Calm down. -Get off me!

33:51.560 --> 33:53.400
-Murderer! -ELOISE: Sadie, darling, no.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.000
-Murderer! -Come on.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.680
-We can manage.

34:00.680 --> 34:04.080
Sadie, Sadie. Are you okay?

34:12.200 --> 34:15.880
The first time I saw you, I just knew you were the one.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.480
You and only you.

34:20.680 --> 34:25.040
Shining...like a diamond.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.440
That's a lyric from a song, right?

34:32.480 --> 34:35.160
Yes, a fusion of a few, to be honest.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.880
The best advice I can give is just to be yourself.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.560
I've been myself for the past 30-odd years

34:40.600 --> 34:42.080
and it hasn't brought me much success.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.360
Rubbish. You were married.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.080
To a woman I met on a date my mum arranged.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.520
Before your wife, there were others?

34:49.560 --> 34:51.040
Hundreds.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.480
A few.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.800
See, you don't take yourself too seriously.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.080
And that's such an attractive

34:57.840 --> 35:00.080
quality in a man.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.520
-Mmm.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.080
Make a woman laugh and you're halfway there.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.000
-Uh...

35:07.040 --> 35:08.160
Try and make her smile.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.040
-Oh, come on.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.320
You can do this.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.320
-Uh, no.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.720
Well, yes.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.920
Yes.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.000
Uh...

35:25.040 --> 35:27.080
Was just laughing with Florence.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.760
-Oh, um...

35:29.800 --> 35:31.840
The time I played rugby at school.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.600
I did my best but all anyone could say was, "Nice try."

35:35.960 --> 35:37.120
Ah, that was kind of them.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.600
No, it's a joke.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.080
Uh, rugby?

35:41.120 --> 35:44.360
A try, you see, it's like a goal.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.360
Uh, no, okay.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.640
Uh, all right.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.280
Ah, yes, yes...

35:47.320 --> 35:50.600
Um, why can't you hear a pterodactyl

35:47.320 --> 35:50.600
going to the toilet?

35:50.640 --> 35:52.000
-Pterodactyl.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.840
A lizardy, flying dinosaur thing.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.640
-No, not your toilet.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.360
It's extinct.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.160
But if it could go to the toilet,

35:58.400 --> 36:00.160
why wouldn't you hear it?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.240
Because the P is silent.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.640
-Pterodactyl.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.680
It doesn't begin with a T, it's a P.

36:08.720 --> 36:12.720
P-T-E...

36:20.280 --> 36:23.080
I'm here all week. Just before the bingo.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.560
19:23:08, 19:23...

36:33.600 --> 36:34.880
19:23:11...

36:34.920 --> 36:36.920
Oh, goodness, there are so many of these.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.240
Ah, JP, any luck with the laptop?

36:39.280 --> 36:42.360
A guest at the hotel found it when they were snorkelling.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.480
The killer must have thrown it in the sea.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.960
It's in a pretty bad way.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.520
Okay, well, get someone from the lab to pick it up,

36:47.560 --> 36:49.440
see if they can recover anything from the hard drive.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.240
I was hoping it might give us what we need to crack this.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.400
Uh, Florence. Zoe's diary, anything?

36:54.440 --> 36:56.280
Still working my way through.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.480
Zoe's made a couple of entries in regard to her

36:56.320 --> 36:59.480
friendship with Sadie.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.080
A couple of incidents of them falling out

37:01.120 --> 37:03.520
but nothing so far suggests murder.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.280
Well, let me know if anything comes up.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.280
Dwayne, financial checks.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.520
Well, all the suspects are solvent.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.640
Seems like Zoe had her feet very firmly on the ground.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.440
Paid herself a small monthly salary

37:11.680 --> 37:14.440
and saved the rest.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.680
But the most interesting thing is

37:16.720 --> 37:20.720
I tracked her finances back to her

37:16.720 --> 37:20.720
first agency, Bounce,

37:20.760 --> 37:22.160
and it turns out that Jay Crocker

37:22.200 --> 37:23.840
was one of the company directors.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.240
That is, before it went

37:23.880 --> 37:26.240
into liquidation.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.120
Really? Jay didn't mention that.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.840
See if there's anything else you can dig up, please.

37:29.880 --> 37:30.960
Yes, Chief.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.400
Zoe's phone.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.920
Looks like she programmed it.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.480
Set an alarm to remind her to call her parents.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.840
Hello, what's this?

37:56.880 --> 37:59.280
There's something in the background.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.520
Get that enlarged, please, JP?

38:02.560 --> 38:03.800
-Yes.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.000
Found a couple of articles on Bounce,

38:06.040 --> 38:08.360
Jay Crocker's modelling agency.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.640
Seems like they've had quite a lot of bad press.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.440
Really

38:12.480 --> 38:15.520
"A toxic culture in which young clients were encouraged,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.120
"and on some occasions bullied into taking extreme

38:18.160 --> 38:20.600
"and dangerous measures to lose weight."

38:20.640 --> 38:22.440
And Zoe was part of all this?

38:22.480 --> 38:23.960
She led the walk-out.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.840
She openly criticised what was going on there

38:25.880 --> 38:28.520
and took most of the clients with her

38:25.880 --> 38:28.520
to a different agency.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.240
Which would explain why she was so

38:28.560 --> 38:30.240
annoyed with Eloise

38:30.280 --> 38:31.760
for taking Camadathol.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.800
Seems Zoe was evidently more than just a pretty face.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.200
A girl with quite a moral code.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.120
And not scared of expressing her opinions

38:39.160 --> 38:41.960
about the less glamorous side of the industry.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.760
To the extent that she caused Jay Crocker's

38:42.000 --> 38:45.760
business to go bankrupt.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
Says motive to me.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.600
But Jay was photographing the show

38:47.840 --> 38:50.600
when Zoe was murdered.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.440
There's no way he could be our killer.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.440
He can't be into two places at the same time.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.720
True, very true.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.520
But nonetheless, why did he lie, Florence?

38:57.560 --> 38:59.120
Why lie?

38:59.160 --> 39:01.960
I think it's time I had a chat with Mr Crocker, don't you?

39:07.160 --> 39:08.600
JAY: Yeah, come in.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.400
You'll have to excuse the mess.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.400
Ah, mess and I are very old friends.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.200
Oh, well.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.560
Uh...

39:17.160 --> 39:19.000
What's this?

39:19.040 --> 39:21.960
It's a way of getting a very expensive looking

39:19.040 --> 39:21.960
effect on the cheap.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.400
See...

39:23.440 --> 39:25.120
Check this out.

39:28.200 --> 39:32.520
A small aperture creates a rippled,

39:28.200 --> 39:32.520
circular halo,

39:32.560 --> 39:36.160
while a wider aperture creates a kind of

39:32.560 --> 39:36.160
psychedelic haze.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.520
It's all low-def, really, but effective.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.280
Low-def.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.880
And a fraction of the cost of an equivalent filter.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.880
Extra cash must come in handy,

39:47.920 --> 39:49.640
since you've been declared bankrupt.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.320
Why didn't you

39:52.200 --> 39:53.840
tell us that Zoe

39:53.880 --> 39:55.720
was signed to your agency, uh...

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
Bounce?

39:57.280 --> 39:58.880
Mmm...

39:58.920 --> 40:00.560
For a long time, I couldn't stand

39:58.920 --> 40:00.560
the sight of that girl.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.120
On account of the walk-out of clients

40:00.600 --> 40:03.120
she instigated?

40:03.160 --> 40:05.320
Mmm. You've been doing your homework.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.040
First of all, I had nothing to do

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
with the way that agency ended up.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.040
I didn't even know what was going on.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.640
You weren't aware that young girls

40:13.680 --> 40:15.520
that your company were supposedly looking after

40:15.560 --> 40:17.560
were becoming anorexic, bulimic?

40:17.600 --> 40:20.560
I was hardly ever there. I was a silent partner.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.960
No involvement apart from putting

40:20.600 --> 40:24.960
up half the money.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.480
If I'd known what was going on, I...

40:26.520 --> 40:27.920
What, you would have put a stop to it?

40:27.960 --> 40:30.280
Yes. Yes, of course I would.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.680
Oh, hang on a minute.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.800
You're not accusing me of killing Zoe?

40:37.840 --> 40:39.560
When she made things public, you lost everything.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.920
That's one hell of a motive, Jay.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.560
I'm not saying she didn't damage me.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.920
But she did the right thing and I don't blame her.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.760
But let's just say I did kill her.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.920
How?

40:52.960 --> 40:55.800
I was out front photographing the show.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.400
How

41:00.840 --> 41:02.400
Ah, Chief.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.880
-Sir, I think you need to see this.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.880
-Yes.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.880
The enlarged section of the photograph you requested.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.320
My God!

41:09.360 --> 41:11.520
In your wildest dreams, did you ever imagine

41:11.560 --> 41:14.960
that you would be looking at a photograph of the victim

41:15.000 --> 41:17.080
actually being killed?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.120
Rosey was on the catwalk when it happened,

41:22.160 --> 41:25.080
so we can rule her out as our killer.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.880
DWAYNE: And Jay was out front.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.520
Unwittingly taking a photograph

41:26.920 --> 41:29.520
of the murder as it happened.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.640
-So it can't be him. -Correct.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.680
JP: So, as we originally suspected,

41:33.720 --> 41:35.960
it has to be one of the three people

41:33.720 --> 41:35.960
in the marquee.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.080
Nelson, Eloise or Sadie.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.360
-Yes.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.120
Remember I mentioned

41:41.160 --> 41:44.160
Zoe and Sadie's friendship was under strain?

41:44.200 --> 41:47.280
A week ago, just before they left the UK

41:44.200 --> 41:47.280
for Saint-Marie,

41:47.320 --> 41:51.360
Zoe writes that Sadie had started

41:47.320 --> 41:51.360
to get even more intense,

41:51.400 --> 41:55.040
to the extent that Sadie told Zoe

41:51.400 --> 41:55.040
she was in love with her.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.760
Okay.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.000
What, and Zoe didn't feel the same?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.920
No.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.760
Two days later, she told Sadie they should spend

41:59.960 --> 42:02.760
less time together.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.120
But it's not the first time this has gone on.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.520
If you go back eight months,

42:06.560 --> 42:09.040
exactly the same thing happened between them.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.000
Sadie started getting close, getting clingy

42:12.040 --> 42:13.760
and Zoe pushed her away.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.040
But what's interesting in the last

42:13.800 --> 42:17.040
time this happened,

42:17.080 --> 42:21.840
two days later, Zoe received her first letter

42:17.080 --> 42:21.840
from the stalker.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.120
Wait, you think that Sadie was the one

42:24.160 --> 42:26.560
sending Zoe the stalker letters?

42:31.160 --> 42:33.120
Uh, excuse me?

42:33.160 --> 42:35.200
Mind if we join you?

42:35.240 --> 42:36.320
Thank you.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.040
Um, yes, um...

42:41.200 --> 42:45.040
Uh, we came across Zoe's diary.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.840
It didn't tell us much we didn't already know

42:46.880 --> 42:51.000
but what it did tell us was that you and

42:46.880 --> 42:51.000
her were very close.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.080
Good friends.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.560
It can be quite a lonely business,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.560
I imagine.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.240
Must be nice when you meet someone you can get on with.

42:58.280 --> 43:01.320
It's rare. People can be quite cold.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.720
I thought I got used to it.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.320
Until you met Zoe.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
Someone I could talk to,

43:09.120 --> 43:12.960
who didn't judge me for being too thin or too fat,

43:13.000 --> 43:14.560
too small or too tall.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.840
Someone who liked me for being me.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.560
FLORENCE: Zoe said much the same in her diary.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.280
I know you wanted a little bit more

43:25.000 --> 43:29.280
than friendship.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.960
A little bit more than Zoe was prepared to give.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.720
I can't talk about this.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.920
Excuse me, I'm sorry,

43:35.960 --> 43:37.760
but this is a murder enquiry and you are a suspect.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.280
Please, sit down.

43:45.760 --> 43:49.480
When we first met, she asked me how I was.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.240
Not who I was or what I'd done,

43:52.280 --> 43:55.080
who I knew, what my day rate was,

43:55.600 --> 43:57.520
but how I was.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.560
And she took an interest, you know?

43:59.600 --> 44:01.160
And I just...

44:01.200 --> 44:02.440
Just fell for her.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.520
Thought I could tell her anything.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.520
So I told her.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.720
That you were in love with her.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.320
SADIE: But she...

44:11.360 --> 44:14.640
She didn't feel the same. Couldn't.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.440
FLORENCE: You wrote the stalker letters,

44:14.680 --> 44:17.440
didn't you?

44:17.480 --> 44:20.200
You sent them because you felt you were losing her.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.760
She was pushing you away,

44:21.800 --> 44:24.640
so you sent her those letters to scare her.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.200
To make her feel frightened.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.200
So that she would turn to someone for support?

44:28.720 --> 44:30.880
Turn to you?

44:30.920 --> 44:35.720
I wanted her to know how much of a good

44:30.920 --> 44:35.720
friend I could be.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.440
If she let me.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.200
Now she's gone.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.400
And I can't tell her how sorry I am.

44:45.760 --> 44:49.440
And tell her how much I loved her.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.400
Because it's too late.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.920
It's too late.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.040
What is it?

45:12.080 --> 45:13.720
I, um...

45:13.760 --> 45:17.160
We've got this one-in-a-million photo

45:13.760 --> 45:17.160
of Zoe's murder, okay?

45:17.200 --> 45:20.000
Brilliant! But it's these other ones.

45:20.040 --> 45:23.080
The ones taken either side of "the killer" photo.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.600
Uh...

45:24.640 --> 45:27.120
I don't know. There's something

45:24.640 --> 45:27.120
about them, I...

45:29.480 --> 45:33.040
Who killed Zoe

45:33.080 --> 45:35.880
And why was she holding a 15-denier stocking

45:35.920 --> 45:38.120
in her left hand when we found her body?

45:38.160 --> 45:40.880
Well, Chief, if you get a whiff of rum

45:38.160 --> 45:40.880
from that stocking,

45:40.920 --> 45:43.200
my Uncle Dennis could be the prime suspect.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.160
He used to use my auntie's old cast-offs

45:45.200 --> 45:46.480
to filter his bootleg booze.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.120
How did he do that?

45:50.160 --> 45:52.680
He used to wrap the stocking around a pipe in the still

45:52.720 --> 45:54.800
to filter the sediments.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.320
Yes, of course he did.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.120
He doesn't do it any more, though.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.120
He only did it the once.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.640
Yes, of course he did.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.360
Stockings? No.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.440
That's why she was holding the stocking!

46:09.120 --> 46:11.440
That is why!

46:13.280 --> 46:14.880
Zoe's phone.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.480
This is all very well. But, um...

46:18.960 --> 46:20.200
Why...

46:20.960 --> 46:23.160
Why? That is the question.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.480
A mobile phone number? She called it two days ago.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.760
Zoe was writing an article called "Life in the Industry".

46:31.440 --> 46:32.920
The drugs, of course!

46:32.960 --> 46:35.240
The drugs, the ones Eloise had.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.920
Excellent, JP. Get them tested for prints. Top priority.

46:37.960 --> 46:40.400
Chief.

46:40.440 --> 46:44.160
I want all the suspects at the hotel

46:40.440 --> 46:44.160
in one hour!

46:48.120 --> 46:49.680
Good afternoon.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.640
Thanks for coming.

46:58.640 --> 47:02.040
This case has introduced me to a world

46:58.640 --> 47:02.040
I knew very little about,

47:02.080 --> 47:03.520
the world of fashion.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.480
A world where appearance is everything.

47:05.520 --> 47:08.360
And that's what's at the heart of this case.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.360
How something looks. An image.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.480
One image in particular.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.160
These are... Apologies, uh...

47:21.200 --> 47:23.400
I know how upsetting this must be.

47:28.680 --> 47:33.840
Zoe's murder presented us with a bit of puzzle.

47:33.880 --> 47:39.120
How did one of you manage to kill her

47:33.880 --> 47:39.120
when you each had an alibi?

47:39.160 --> 47:41.120
Nelson helping Sadie,

47:41.160 --> 47:44.040
Eloise on the phone to her agent,

47:41.160 --> 47:44.040
Rosey on the catwalk,

47:44.080 --> 47:46.080
Jay taking photographs.

47:46.120 --> 47:48.920
At one point, we thought it could have

47:46.120 --> 47:48.920
been Zoe's stalker.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.800
But something about that didn't quite ring true.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.960
-Well, it could have been you.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.840
The charge for assault on file.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.840
Anger issues.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.400
Zoe had a bad attitude

48:00.440 --> 48:02.120
and didn't show you the respect

48:00.440 --> 48:02.120
you think you deserved,

48:02.160 --> 48:03.320
more than enough motive.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.200
But that doesn't make me a murderer.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.040
No, no, it doesn't.

48:08.280 --> 48:10.920
Sadie, you got close to Zoe.

48:10.960 --> 48:14.720
You even sent her letters meant to bring

48:10.960 --> 48:14.720
you closer together.

48:14.760 --> 48:18.480
But how could you kill someone you so obviously loved?

48:20.240 --> 48:22.280
Eloise, you shared a room with Zoe.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.920
She found out about your drug use.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.840
Had she exposed you, you'd have lost everything.

48:27.880 --> 48:31.960
I couldn't. There's no way...

48:32.000 --> 48:34.560
-I know.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.680
-Rosey... -JP: It wasn't you.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.720
Because you were photographed on the catwalk

48:38.760 --> 48:41.120
at the exact time the killer struck.

48:41.160 --> 48:43.440
And Jay took the photograph, so it couldn't have been you.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.000
Yes, or could it?

48:50.360 --> 48:53.120
How could I be in two places at the same time?

48:53.160 --> 48:54.800
You couldn't.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.680
But like I said, this is all about image,

48:56.720 --> 48:58.960
or how things appear to be.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.560
And what if you could appear to be

48:59.000 --> 49:02.560
somewhere you weren't?

49:04.760 --> 49:06.160
The photographs.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.520
Your piece de resistance.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.600
You couldn't possibly have killed Zoe,

49:10.640 --> 49:13.200
because you captured the very second

49:10.640 --> 49:13.200
she was killed.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.840
I don't understand. Oh, well,

49:14.880 --> 49:16.480
it's really rather simple.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.800
You see, two days ago,

49:17.840 --> 49:20.880
Zoe programmed an alarm on her mobile phone,

49:20.920 --> 49:23.440
a reminder to call her parents.

49:24.480 --> 49:25.680
And it got me thinking,

49:25.720 --> 49:27.560
you didn't actually need to be there

49:27.600 --> 49:29.680
when the photographs were taken.

49:29.720 --> 49:34.240
Not if you programmed your camera

49:29.720 --> 49:34.240
to continue taking photographs

49:34.280 --> 49:39.120
whilst you made you way into the marquee

49:34.280 --> 49:39.120
and murdered Zoe.

49:39.160 --> 49:42.880
You simply set your camera to automatic mode.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.360
And with the audience's attention

49:42.920 --> 49:45.360
above the catwalk,

49:46.440 --> 49:50.360
you slipped beneath it, unnoticed.

49:50.400 --> 49:53.680
Without anyone being aware of what you were up to,

49:53.720 --> 49:56.480
you made your way under the catwalk.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.520
But one of us would've seen him.

49:59.560 --> 50:01.240
Not if he had his timings right.

50:01.280 --> 50:04.120
It takes two people to get someone into a dress?

50:04.160 --> 50:05.800
It's quite intricate. HUMPHREY: Which he did.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.240
Jay had total access to the backstage area

50:07.520 --> 50:10.240
during rehearsals.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.160
I'm going to get some shots of the girls backstage,

50:10.280 --> 50:13.160
Nelson.

50:13.200 --> 50:16.240
He knew where everyone was supposed to be and when.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.840
Nelson and Eloise helping Sadie into the dress,

50:18.880 --> 50:20.720
Rosey on the catwalk. As it was,

50:20.760 --> 50:22.120
Eloise ended up outside the marquee

50:22.160 --> 50:23.520
taking a phone call from her agent,

50:23.560 --> 50:26.080
but that didn't upset things too much.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.640
She, like the others, was still entirely oblivious

50:28.680 --> 50:31.280
to Jay's presence inside that tent.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.760
And with everyone in their place,

50:33.800 --> 50:36.120
you had less than a minute to get backstage, kill Zoe

50:36.160 --> 50:38.240
and make your way back out front again

50:36.160 --> 50:38.240
and recover your camera

50:38.280 --> 50:39.960
and take the final shots of the night.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.320
Leaving it to look, once more, like no one,

50:44.360 --> 50:46.360
especially you,

50:46.400 --> 50:49.040
could possibly have got backstage

50:46.400 --> 50:49.040
to commit murder.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.440
After that,

50:50.480 --> 50:52.520
you let the talk of Zoe's stalker

50:50.480 --> 50:52.520
back in England

50:52.560 --> 50:55.360
misdirect us into thinking that's who our killer was.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.440
There was something, though.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.960
Zoe had some kind of a stalker.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.840
Except what you didn't know was

51:00.880 --> 51:02.760
the letters that Zoe had been sent

51:02.800 --> 51:07.240
weren't those of a crazed obsessive

51:02.800 --> 51:07.240
intent on harming her.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.880
They were written by someone who only had

51:08.920 --> 51:10.840
Zoe's best interests at heart.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.360
Someone who loved her.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.560
Over 500 photographs.

51:16.600 --> 51:20.080
One of them conveniently capturing

51:16.600 --> 51:20.080
the killer in action,

51:20.120 --> 51:23.280
giving you the perfect alibi.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.280
I assume that was planned, Jay?

51:26.320 --> 51:29.040
That you wanted us to find it?

51:29.080 --> 51:30.560
It's rather audacious, really.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.680
This is the photograph we enlarged,

51:36.720 --> 51:38.120
only to discover that within it

51:38.160 --> 51:42.680
was the image of Zoe's actual murder taking place.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.800
The other 10 or so images are the ones that

51:42.720 --> 51:45.800
were taken around it.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.680
But it was something about them

51:45.840 --> 51:47.680
that bothered me.

51:47.720 --> 51:49.200
Something I couldn't quite get my head round,

51:49.240 --> 51:51.080
and then it hit me.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.440
They were all framed identically.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.920
The angle didn't change once.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.120
And you presumed we'd never notice?

51:59.160 --> 52:01.480
But unfortunately for you, we did.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.560
And all thanks to this.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.320
If it hadn't been for Officer Myer's

52:06.360 --> 52:08.080
dear old Uncle Dennis and his illegal booze still,

52:08.120 --> 52:09.840
we might never have got there.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.520
See, you told me

52:11.560 --> 52:13.680
how you could slip a plastic bottle

52:11.560 --> 52:13.680
over your camera lens

52:13.720 --> 52:15.680
to get a certain effect.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.400
<i>A budget-priced</i> <i>photographer's trick</i>

52:15.720 --> 52:19.400
<i>to get the effect you wanted.</i>

52:19.440 --> 52:20.840
<i>Well,</i> <i>I had a look on the internet.</i>

52:20.880 --> 52:22.680
There are others.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.640
A stocking stretched across the lens

52:25.680 --> 52:29.960
will create an effect known as a diffusion.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.160
Quite well-known amongst

52:30.000 --> 52:33.160
the photographic fraternity.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.280
And while Dwayne's Uncle Dennis

52:35.320 --> 52:38.760
used to use his stocking to filter alcohol,

52:38.800 --> 52:42.560
you use yours to filter light.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.720
You see, I think you had this stocking in your pocket

52:44.760 --> 52:46.840
when you murdered Zoe Mackay.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.280
We'll need the memory card.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.960
<i>It's where you carry</i> <i>all the tools of your trade.</i>

52:53.360 --> 52:56.360
So what reason would I have to kill Zoe?

52:56.400 --> 53:00.440
Our killer discovered that Zoe was writing an article

53:00.480 --> 53:04.280
for a prominent magazine about life as a model.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.760
An expose. Guaranteed to

53:04.320 --> 53:07.760
a ruffle a few feathers.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.080
But whose feathers?

53:09.120 --> 53:11.040
This is... This is ridiculous.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.400
HUMPHREY: Three days ago, Zoe fell out with Eloise

53:13.440 --> 53:16.200
when she discovered she was taking Camadathol.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.320
We know that she led the march away from your agency

53:18.360 --> 53:20.840
once she discovered that drug use

53:18.360 --> 53:20.840
was being encouraged.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.560
That was two years ago, so why would I kill her now?

53:23.600 --> 53:25.960
The day after she came to Saint-Marie,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.880
Zoe made a call to the dealer who supplied Eloise.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.000
HUMPHREY: I assume that she somehow copied the number

53:31.040 --> 53:32.160
when you weren't looking, Eloise.

53:32.200 --> 53:34.600
But why make that call here?

53:34.640 --> 53:36.720
Why not do it back in the UK?

53:36.760 --> 53:38.560
After all, that's where the supplier was.

53:38.600 --> 53:42.520
Unless, of course, Zoe suspected

53:38.600 --> 53:42.520
the dealer was on the island.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.320
HUMPHREY:<i> Unless she</i> <i>thought the dealer was you.</i>

53:48.480 --> 53:50.040
<i>See,</i> <i>we checked your mobile number</i>

53:50.080 --> 53:52.240
<i>and it didn't match up with</i> <i>the call Zoe had placed.</i>

53:52.280 --> 53:55.240
<i>But that's because I think</i> <i>you've got two phones, Jay.</i>

53:55.280 --> 53:57.280
<i></i>

53:57.320 --> 53:59.520
<i>...and one for business,</i> <i>your drug trade.</i>

54:01.800 --> 54:03.960
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.480
This is the number Zoe dialled.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.760
I think it's for you, Jay.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.880
You blamed your former business partner

54:24.920 --> 54:28.120
for pushing drugs onto the models at your agency.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.640
But it was you, and Zoe knew that.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.520
You stumbled across Zoe's laptop.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.760
Where you last had it.

54:34.800 --> 54:36.720
HUMPHREY: You realised that it was her

54:34.800 --> 54:36.720
that called you,

54:36.760 --> 54:39.000
discovered that she was about to expose you

54:39.040 --> 54:42.360
and destroy your reputation all over again.

54:42.400 --> 54:45.800
But you weren't going to let that

54:42.400 --> 54:45.800
happen, not for a second time.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.840
Because this time you were going to kill her.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.520
<i>You waited for your cue,</i>

54:49.560 --> 54:52.120
<i>for Rosey to step</i> <i>onto the catwalk.</i>

54:52.160 --> 54:55.320
<i>And once she'd gone,</i> <i>all you needed was</i>

54:52.160 --> 54:55.320
<i>for Zoe to return.</i>

54:57.120 --> 54:58.720
<i>As you strangled her,</i>

54:58.760 --> 55:00.720
<i>as she fought for her life,</i> <i>arms flailing,</i>

55:00.760 --> 55:04.600
<i>I think she was</i> <i>reaching out, grabbing.</i>

55:04.640 --> 55:08.800
<i>Without your knowledge,</i> <i>the stocking ended</i>

55:04.640 --> 55:08.800
<i>up in her clutch.</i>

55:12.240 --> 55:14.080
Caught out by a single stocking.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.880
So close, Jay.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.560
So close.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.040
Mind your head.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.480
ROSEY: Excuse me?

55:32.520 --> 55:34.000
Do you have a moment? Yeah, of course I do.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.080
Sorry, I meant him.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.120
Mmm?

55:39.160 --> 55:41.720
I knew that, I was just teasing.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.360
It's for you.

55:46.120 --> 55:50.120
I've been wanting to say but couldn't.

55:46.120 --> 55:50.120
The time wasn't right and...

55:50.160 --> 55:52.480
That is, I didn't want to compromise your, um...

55:54.680 --> 55:56.520
I wanted to ask if you are the same JP

55:56.560 --> 55:58.520
that was in the year below me at school?

56:01.440 --> 56:03.040
Were you the guy that left that flower for me

56:03.080 --> 56:04.240
on that last day of term?

56:04.280 --> 56:07.040
Wow, you remember that?

56:08.280 --> 56:10.000
I thought it was really sweet.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.200
I looked for you to say thank you

56:10.040 --> 56:12.200
but you had gone.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.280
I didn't know where you lived and now you're here.

56:17.480 --> 56:19.840
Here I am.

56:19.880 --> 56:23.800
She's giving him the brush-off.

56:19.880 --> 56:23.800
Look, she's going.

56:23.840 --> 56:28.360
Cupid fires his arrow and the victim's

56:23.840 --> 56:28.360
dead in seconds.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.640
Poor JP.

56:37.320 --> 56:42.000
But his face and body language were screaming

56:37.320 --> 56:42.000
defeat and heartache.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.720
Looks can obviously be deceptive.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.800
Mmm.

56:46.120 --> 56:48.320
-Great. -Good luck to him.

56:48.360 --> 56:52.080
No, it's not about luck. It's about confidence.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.000
And who've had thought he'd have the confidence

56:54.040 --> 56:56.040
to pull a woman like that?

57:10.800 --> 57:13.640
Act normal, as if nothing happened.

57:17.880 --> 57:20.280
JP looks like he's having a lot of fun.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.800
They seem to be getting on really well.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.160
Who would have thought, eh?

57:23.200 --> 57:25.360
Maybe we should ask him for a few tips.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.080
Well, not you, obviously.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.240
You're having no trouble at all

57:27.120 --> 57:29.240
in that department, Chief.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.520
Thought you might need this.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.520
Thank you, Catherine.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.920
-Please.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.840
Only this time, I'll have it in a glass.

57:49.080 --> 57:52.640
She was obviously enjoying your company,

57:49.080 --> 57:52.640
until...

57:52.680 --> 57:54.320
Until, yes, we were getting on famously

57:54.360 --> 57:56.080
and then she asked me for the time.

57:57.800 --> 58:00.000
Oh, well, back to the drawing board.

58:00.040 --> 58:01.800
You'll get there.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.640
Yes, one day. One day.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.720
Funny thing is I don't even wear a watch.

58:09.320 --> 58:12.000
DWAYNE:<i> I'd known Cedrik</i> <i>since I was 13 years old.</i>

58:12.040 --> 58:15.160
<i>He thought I could do better</i> <i>and I believed him.</i>

58:15.200 --> 58:17.560
<i>I put the phone in</i> <i>his coffin myself.</i>

58:17.600 --> 58:22.320
Why have only one pillow without a pillowcase?

58:22.360 --> 58:24.160
Someone held it over his face.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.040
He was murdered.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.040
JP:<i> I'm worried about Dwayne.</i>

58:28.080 --> 58:30.320
DWAYNE: I looked up to these men

58:28.080 --> 58:30.320
my whole life

58:30.360 --> 58:32.640
and I'm starting to wonder if I got it all wrong.
