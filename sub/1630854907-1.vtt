(sirens wailing)
(heavy breathing)

00:07.783 --> 00:09.049
- Denny?

00:10.627 --> 00:11.677
Denny?

00:11.795 --> 00:13.595
Denny, look at me.

00:17.025 --> 00:18.976
You don't have to do this.

00:20.137 --> 00:22.312
You don't have to die here.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.318
(clock ticking)

00:35.219 --> 00:39.204
(light christmas music)

01:12.039 --> 01:13.130
Morning, hun.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.448
- You're up early.
Thank you.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.367
Have you seen my keys?

01:20.147 --> 01:21.830
Right.

01:22.666 --> 01:23.807
- Busy day today?

01:23.834 --> 01:25.142
- You have no idea.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.370
- I booked a sitter for tonight.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.173
- 'cause?
- Date night.

01:31.950 --> 01:32.891
- Right.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.152
- Are we still on, or...?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.987
No, we're good, we're good.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.322
I just...

01:38.349 --> 01:42.476
I think I can get back
by like three or four.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.368
- Forgetting something?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.846
- What would I do without you?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.257
- Walk to work on
an empty stomach.

02:05.259 --> 02:05.666
- Yeah.

02:05.784 --> 02:06.424
(loud grinding)

02:06.426 --> 02:09.461
- Oh, seriously, bob?

02:11.098 --> 02:13.841
- Can I just go bust that thing
over his head?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.859
- No, I'll handle it.

02:15.886 --> 02:16.918
- Okay.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.679
- Oh...
- What is that?

02:18.797 --> 02:21.723
- It's a...
A christmas present.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.609
- Val, I thought we said
we weren't giving gifts

02:24.611 --> 02:25.610
To each other this year.

02:25.896 --> 02:26.961
- Well, we skipped it
for our anniversary

02:27.022 --> 02:28.355
But I thought for christmas
we could still--

02:28.473 --> 02:30.190
- Look, we're still under water.
We got so many...

02:30.309 --> 02:32.209
Look, I'm sorry.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.360
I just... I didn't know,
alright?

02:33.478 --> 02:35.954
- It's no big deal.
- Let's not do this, okay?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.914
Let's not have a fight
over nothing.

02:38.074 --> 02:38.540
- Agreed.

02:38.542 --> 02:41.343
I just thought it was...

02:41.370 --> 02:44.446
Time for something fun,
you know?

02:44.564 --> 02:49.209
Something to, uh...
Remember all our good times by.

02:49.328 --> 02:51.044
Do you want
to open it early?

02:51.163 --> 02:53.213
- I'll open it later tonight,
date night, got it?

02:53.332 --> 02:55.924
(car engine roaring)

02:57.144 --> 02:59.428
(grinding continues)

03:05.319 --> 03:07.394
- Hey, mom.

03:07.512 --> 03:08.320
What's for breakfast?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.322
- What are you doing up already?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.608
- The saw.

03:15.178 --> 03:17.237
- Ah, well... Good.

03:17.356 --> 03:21.575
Because even though
it's winter break

03:21.693 --> 03:23.410
And you're stuck at home
with mom,

03:23.528 --> 03:27.581
I have so many fun
activities planned for today.

03:27.699 --> 03:30.250
We're gonna need that extra time
just to get to them all.

03:30.369 --> 03:33.011
Including some special
reading time,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.512
You and me, parker?

03:34.514 --> 03:35.863
- Baby reading time.

03:35.925 --> 03:39.517
- Spencer, we do not
bully in this house,

03:39.519 --> 03:41.261
And if you are nice,

03:41.380 --> 03:45.915
We are going to bake
christmas cookies at 4 p.M.

03:45.976 --> 03:46.391
- Ugh...

03:46.510 --> 03:51.012
- I... Di... Did?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.364
- Mm-hmm.
- Not cu...

03:52.366 --> 03:59.129
- Cut.
- Cut, cut do...

03:59.156 --> 04:01.615
Dow... Down.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.391
That ch...

04:03.452 --> 04:06.303
- You remember to flip those
vowels and those consonants?

04:06.330 --> 04:10.548
- Che... Che...

04:10.550 --> 04:13.310
- Cherry tree.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.312
- When christmas is over,

04:15.339 --> 04:19.341
I don't want to go
back to school.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.876
- I know it's hard but--

04:21.995 --> 04:23.561
- No, you don't.
You're not there.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.714
They just stare at me
and I'm just...

04:25.832 --> 04:28.850
It sucks and I don't
want to go back.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.328
- Parker, look at me.

04:31.355 --> 04:34.556
I see you,

04:34.674 --> 04:37.651
And you are an intelligent,

04:37.769 --> 04:39.911
Handsome, hardworking young man

04:39.913 --> 04:42.080
Who has so much
to offer this world.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.508
And the world is so lucky
to have you,

04:44.535 --> 04:48.920
And a lot of people were
exactly where you are right now.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.347
Albert einstein,

04:50.374 --> 04:52.457
Pablo picasso,
even george washington.

04:53.952 --> 04:56.003
This is nothing
to be ashamed of.

04:56.121 --> 04:59.931
It's just your brain is focused
on other things

04:59.933 --> 05:01.842
Than what is necessary
for this task.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.344
But you're going to do great,
I know it.

05:05.297 --> 05:07.431
Let's try again.

05:08.375 --> 05:14.062
- I did not cut down that...

05:14.973 --> 05:15.355
Strawberry tree.

05:15.474 --> 05:18.208
- Oh, ha, ha.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.860
(phone ringing)

05:20.720 --> 05:22.879
- Mom! Dad's on the phone.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.448
- Keep working.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.126
Hey, hun, what's up?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.202
(mark): Hey.

05:29.321 --> 05:31.463
Hey, you remember how I said
all the rain this month

05:31.465 --> 05:34.057
Slowed us up on the concrete
work on the side?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.149
- Uh-huh.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.378
- Well, we really gotta catch up
by christmas so...

05:38.497 --> 05:40.564
I'm just gonna have to work late
this week

05:40.591 --> 05:43.733
Most nights
and including tonight.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.235
- That's too bad.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.054
<i> - There's nothing</i>
<i> I can do about it right now.</i>

05:47.172 --> 05:48.221
We're just way behind.

05:48.340 --> 05:49.556
- Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.966
I'll see you when
you get home tonight.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.769
<i> - Val, come on--</i>

05:55.389 --> 05:57.439
(saw grinding)
- ugh!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.707
- Hiya, val.
What do you think?

06:07.709 --> 06:10.369
I'm planning to turn the new
addition into a billiard room.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.003
- That sounds fun, bob,

06:12.005 --> 06:13.722
But um... The thing is,

06:13.724 --> 06:14.589
The saw, it's really loud--

06:14.591 --> 06:16.333
- Yeah, I know it's loud.

06:16.493 --> 06:17.992
That's why I wear the ear plugs.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.753
But it's the only way
to cut wood,

06:19.871 --> 06:20.528
So what are you gonna do?

06:20.589 --> 06:22.680
Uh... Anyway, I want to try

06:22.682 --> 06:25.467
And get ahead of the weather.
Did you need something?

06:27.096 --> 06:30.688
- I um... Am making lemonade
for the boys, do you want some?

06:30.690 --> 06:33.683
- Oh! That'd be lovely.

06:35.879 --> 06:37.521
(whirring)

06:40.300 --> 06:41.108
- What's going on?

06:41.226 --> 06:43.852
(sighing)
- making lemonade, want some?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.529
- Sweet.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.616
(whirring)

06:52.571 --> 06:54.871
(loud knocking)

06:55.031 --> 06:56.448
- Yes, bob?
Haha! I'm coming, bob.

06:56.566 --> 07:00.201
Sorry, did I... Did I take too
long to make your lemonade?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.719
What would you like?
Would you like me to make a pie?

07:01.721 --> 07:04.714
What would be good for you, bob?

07:05.542 --> 07:08.168
- Get back!

07:08.170 --> 07:09.553
Get back now!

07:10.471 --> 07:10.786
Close the door!

07:10.848 --> 07:12.556
Close the door!

07:12.716 --> 07:13.381
- Mom?

07:13.541 --> 07:15.517
- That's my son!

07:15.635 --> 07:16.977
That's just my son!
- Is that it?

07:17.095 --> 07:18.620
Is anyone else in the house?
(panting)

07:18.622 --> 07:19.779
Is there anyone else
in the house?

07:19.781 --> 07:20.722
- No, there's no one
else in the house.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.548
- Anyone else in the house?
- Mom...

07:22.568 --> 07:23.892
- No.
- You sit over there.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.001
Sit there.
- Where, I don't...

07:25.028 --> 07:25.485
- Not you, not you, not you!

07:26.697 --> 07:27.487
Turn on the television!
- Okay.

07:27.606 --> 07:30.081
- News! News! News!

(val): I... I don't--
- yes, you do, you know.

07:46.491 --> 07:47.540
(val): I don't know.

07:47.659 --> 07:48.616
- As soon as you saw my face,
you were terrified.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.527
- It's the gun...

07:50.554 --> 07:52.262
Because you have the gun,
that's all.

07:52.422 --> 07:54.556

Who's that?
(val): It's my neighbour.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.197
I told him I'd make him
something to drink.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.290
He's going to be expecting me.
- Enough!

08:12.292 --> 08:13.825
Enough, okay?! Enough!

08:15.204 --> 08:15.702
(crying)

08:15.820 --> 08:17.278
- Stop crying, okay?

08:17.438 --> 08:18.171
What are you so scared of?

08:18.173 --> 08:20.181
Did I ever do anything to you?

08:20.183 --> 08:21.799
- He's just a kid.
He doesn't any better.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.485
Please let me put him
in the other room

08:24.546 --> 08:27.172
And then he'll be
out of your way.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.719
- Go!

08:36.341 --> 08:38.575
- Mom, what's happening?
- Just stay here, okay?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.228
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:41.988 --> 08:42.746
- Wait 'till dad comes home.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.490
Dad will show him.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.492
- Do not leave this room, okay?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.401
Do you understand me?

08:48.520 --> 08:51.145
You wait here until
I come get you, okay?

08:51.264 --> 08:52.906
- That's enough, let's go!
- Mom...

08:53.024 --> 08:53.757
- Okay. Just stay here.

08:53.784 --> 08:57.335

11:17.260 --> 11:18.376
- Hey.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.786
Hey, babe, look I just wanted
to say I didn't realize

11:20.906 --> 11:23.406
How big a thing
this date night was,

11:23.433 --> 11:25.483
<i> So I got a guy</i>
<i> to cover me tonight,</i>

11:25.485 --> 11:27.227
<i> I'll be home before</i>
<i> the sitter gets there.</i>

11:27.345 --> 11:28.486
- No, it's alright.

11:28.488 --> 11:33.082
If... If you have to work late,
I understand.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.918
- No, no. Val, I'm trying.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.118
- No, it's really...

11:36.479 --> 11:38.254
- Can we just start over today?
Can we just do that?

11:38.281 --> 11:39.923
- Really, it's fine.
I totally get it.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.908
(mark):<i> Val, I'm going</i>
<i> to be ho--</i>

11:44.863 --> 11:46.738
(saw grinding)

11:46.856 --> 11:49.098
- Why did you do that?

11:49.534 --> 11:53.327
- Now he'll definitely
come home, early.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.255
And I need a car.

11:59.069 --> 12:01.010
- There's a guy in the garage!
You can take it.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.239
You can take it,
you can leave right now.

12:04.241 --> 12:06.349
- Do I look stupid to you?

12:06.509 --> 12:07.909
- No.

12:07.911 --> 12:09.769
You look scary.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.712
- Good.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.399
You know I can't leave
you here to call the cops.

12:14.918 --> 12:16.434
(grinding stops)

12:16.552 --> 12:18.319
- Ah, thank god.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.801
You... You could...

12:24.828 --> 12:27.528
You could put me
in the bedroom with my son.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.473
- They'll be looking for me.
I could get spotted.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.532
It's too risky.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.459
- Mom!

12:32.577 --> 12:33.826
(tense music)

12:34.463 --> 12:36.855
- Should I... Let's put on
that news again, right?

12:36.973 --> 12:39.240
That news...
(parker): Mom!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.375
- Whatever that thing was
that you were looking for--

12:41.494 --> 12:44.512
Wait! No!
Wait, wait, wait, please!

12:45.757 --> 12:47.799
Wait! I'm sorry.

12:47.917 --> 12:50.218
It's my fault,
I should've told you.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.870
(children's music playing)

12:51.872 --> 12:56.733
- Don't ever lie to me, again!

12:58.895 --> 13:00.853
- I promise!
- Bring him!

13:00.972 --> 13:05.158
- It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay...

13:05.276 --> 13:06.868
I got you.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.087
Okay, there you go.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.015
There you go. Take one.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.593
See, isn't that better? Hmm?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.337
- I'm scared.

13:18.456 --> 13:20.340
- Oh, my boys.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.220
I love you so much.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.683
Spencer, I need you to take care
of your brother, okay?

13:30.802 --> 13:33.945
You wait here until someone
comes to get you, okay?

13:33.947 --> 13:36.481
- What?
- I need to know I can

13:36.599 --> 13:37.598
Count on you.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.209
- Where are you going?
- You are in charge now.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.529
Spencer's in charge, okay?

13:42.647 --> 13:43.196
Promise me?

13:43.314 --> 13:45.715
You be my big brave boys.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.866
You can be brave.
I know you're my brave boys.

13:46.985 --> 13:49.919
- I'm promise.
- Shh, shh, shh.

13:49.921 --> 13:51.921
- I love you, mom.

13:51.923 --> 13:54.799
- I love you, too.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.392
- Promise me you'll come home?

13:56.419 --> 13:59.254
- I'm coming home.
I am coming home.

14:00.848 --> 14:02.924
(ominous music)

14:11.509 --> 14:13.985
I'll drive you.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.636
You said you needed a car

14:15.755 --> 14:18.748
But you don't want to leave me
behind or get spotted.

14:18.775 --> 14:19.991
Let me drive you.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.159
You can lie in the back,

14:22.161 --> 14:24.529
I'll take you wherever
you need to go.

14:25.832 --> 14:29.284
Just leave my boys here, okay?

14:30.028 --> 14:33.246
- You love them?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.601
They love you?

14:38.628 --> 14:40.545
- Of course.

14:41.873 --> 14:44.132
(soft music)

14:48.855 --> 14:50.471
- Let's go.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.898
(distant saw grinding)

15:04.395 --> 15:05.962
Don't try anything funny, okay?

15:05.989 --> 15:09.132
Drive. Go! Drive!

15:09.159 --> 15:11.200
(engine starts)

15:36.569 --> 15:38.937
(soft music)

15:44.343 --> 15:45.835
- Looking good, cherie!

15:45.862 --> 15:47.170
- Thank you, edna.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.063
You guys out for
your morning walk?

15:49.181 --> 15:51.582
- Gotta make sure his ticker
still works.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.400
(chuckles)

15:52.518 --> 15:56.087
- Those two
are so stinking cute.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.664
- Yeah.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.542
(tense music)

16:09.127 --> 16:10.843
(denny): Right up here.
(clears throat)

16:10.962 --> 16:12.553
On the right.

16:13.456 --> 16:14.605
Slow down.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.307
Slow down!

16:17.235 --> 16:21.396
Quiet. Go in really quiet.

16:27.170 --> 16:29.696
Turn off the engine.
Turn it off.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.614
(engine stops)

16:35.078 --> 16:38.246
(sighing)
how long you been married?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.583
- About 10 years.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.046
- What do you think your husband
would've done

16:47.165 --> 16:50.675
If he came home and found me
in his house with a gun?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.554
- He would've fought you.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.315
- That's what real men do.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.769
We gotta fight for what we love.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.231
You know?

17:05.349 --> 17:07.083
Right?
- Oh.

17:07.110 --> 17:10.445
Yes, that's right.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.579
(soft eerie music)

17:21.065 --> 17:22.457
- Let's go.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.585
(distant dog barking)

17:25.703 --> 17:27.462
Quiet.

17:28.206 --> 17:32.608
Just be really quiet. Okay?

17:32.635 --> 17:36.554
Knock, don't say a word, okay?

17:38.941 --> 17:41.267
(dog barking)

18:00.446 --> 18:02.713
- Hey, man!
- Hey, mark. How you doing?

18:02.715 --> 18:06.050
- Sorry, you got
any idea where val went?

18:06.052 --> 18:07.310
- No, but she tore out of here.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.219
- Huh.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.129
(children): Daddy! Help!

18:10.248 --> 18:13.407
(children screaming)

18:14.085 --> 18:15.635
- Daddy!
- What is going on? Hey!

18:15.753 --> 18:16.877
(crying)

18:16.996 --> 18:20.640
Mom's gone. A man took her,
she's gone. She's gone!

18:25.271 --> 18:28.272
(clock ticking)

18:34.697 --> 18:38.098
<i> (man on tv): You have no right</i>
<i>to blame carly for what you did!</i>

18:38.159 --> 18:40.417
<i> (woman): For what I did?</i>

18:40.419 --> 18:42.895
<i> Don't you dare try</i>
<i> to pin this on me!</i>

18:42.914 --> 18:45.230
<i> I did exactly</i>
<i> what you asked me to!</i>

18:45.350 --> 18:46.849
(laughing)

18:47.669 --> 18:49.185
- You are going to go bankrupt,
you idiot!

18:49.212 --> 18:52.096
(laughing)

18:52.098 --> 18:53.356
All that money.
(laughing)

18:53.383 --> 18:56.100
He thought he was so smart.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.768
(knocking)

18:57.770 --> 18:59.220
Who is it?

19:00.423 --> 19:03.266
Coming, hold your horses.

19:07.689 --> 19:08.729
What do you want?

19:11.033 --> 19:13.860
Oh, it's you.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.194
(denny): Get inside!

19:15.313 --> 19:16.287
Get inside!

19:16.289 --> 19:19.657
(scoffing)

19:20.410 --> 19:21.942
- Where's cherie?

19:22.061 --> 19:24.128
- Would you like a cup of tea
or something, dear?

19:24.130 --> 19:25.254
- Answer me, francine.

19:25.256 --> 19:26.947
- Oh, you always had no sense,

19:27.066 --> 19:28.282
But I thought you at least
had some manners.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.943
- I'm so sick of your crap.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.369
- Oh, what,

19:32.488 --> 19:35.381
You too scared to talk to me
without your big gun?

19:35.499 --> 19:37.383
- Shut up! Shut up!

19:37.501 --> 19:39.476
- Yeah, and who are you?

19:39.478 --> 19:42.646
I know we just met,
but you can do a whole hell

19:42.648 --> 19:44.164
Of a lot better than this man.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.075
(denny): She's not
my girlfriend.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.911
I would never do that to cherie,
you know that!

19:48.938 --> 19:49.987
- It don't matter.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.372
Cherie's done with you.

19:51.374 --> 19:53.149
My daughter finally
came to her senses.

19:53.309 --> 19:55.326
What little of them
she ever had.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.586
- You couldn't just
stay out of it.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.405
You were always trying
to ruin what we had.

19:59.523 --> 20:02.015
Why couldn't you just
leave us alone?

20:02.076 --> 20:03.242
Just tell me where she is!

20:03.361 --> 20:06.595
- I don't know what my daughter
ever saw in you!

20:06.623 --> 20:08.689
Or what sob story you told her

20:08.750 --> 20:10.433
To get her to feel
sorry for you.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.010
Aw...

20:13.012 --> 20:14.528
- You can't talk to me
like that, okay?

20:14.589 --> 20:19.091
Not anymore.
- Boy, I don't see you at all.

20:19.210 --> 20:22.169
You're insignificant.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.672
A nuisance my daughter
stepped in

20:24.790 --> 20:26.615
And should've picked
off her heel

20:26.643 --> 20:28.284
And just walked right on past
without a second thought.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.286
- Ma'am, that's not necessary.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.289
- Yeah, what do you
know about it?

20:33.316 --> 20:36.850
This man is a dead beat.

20:36.969 --> 20:41.322
A good-for-nothing,
and he never will be.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.376
- Please, I'd just... I'd really
like to talk to cherie.

20:45.378 --> 20:49.330
- Well, I really need
to win lotto.

20:50.908 --> 20:53.217
Oh... Ah...

20:53.219 --> 20:55.544
Oh, I'm tired of this, denny.

20:56.247 --> 20:57.964
You're a time burglar.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.317
You just stole some
of my precious time.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.243
Stole it right out of my life.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.155
- I told you, you can't talk--
- just like the countless months

21:06.182 --> 21:08.824
You stole from cherie
and gd knows how many

21:08.851 --> 21:13.020
From this poor woman who's got
about as much sense as you.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.330
On account of the fact
she hadn't gotten up

21:14.357 --> 21:17.233
And walked out of my house yet.

21:17.768 --> 21:21.729
Now, you two, out of my house.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.414
- Ma'am, I don't think
you understand the situation--

21:23.416 --> 21:26.342
- Ugh, trust me, honey.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.420
A worthless runt like denny,

21:29.422 --> 21:31.539
You gotta put him
in his place.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.851
And that sure as heck's
not with my daughter.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.920
(laughing)

21:41.884 --> 21:42.358
(kettle whistling)

21:42.385 --> 21:46.195
Tea for two. Oh!

21:46.222 --> 21:48.239
And none for you, little boy.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.849
(groaning)

22:04.824 --> 22:06.824
(car beeping)

22:30.582 --> 22:33.851
(car sputtering)

22:37.681 --> 22:39.865
- Hey, dispatch, can I get
a tow truck

22:39.983 --> 22:41.492
Down to the cold springs bridge?

22:41.494 --> 22:42.843
Truck appears to be abandoned

22:42.904 --> 22:44.578
And the batteries
are dead, over.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.590
<i>- Copy that, requesting one now.</i>
<i> Over.</i>

22:47.617 --> 22:49.983
- Oh, can you also run
the plates for uh...

22:50.102 --> 22:53.311
Washington two, g-a,
one, two, three?

22:53.431 --> 22:53.913
Over.

22:54.031 --> 22:55.589
<i> - Uh, doing that now.</i>

22:55.591 --> 22:56.332
<i> Hey, you're near</i>
<i> wax road, right?</i>

22:56.492 --> 22:58.509
- Yeah, that's affirmative.

22:58.511 --> 22:59.410
<i> - We just got a call,</i>
<i> possible kidnapping</i>

22:59.528 --> 23:02.104
<i> On wax and albright.</i>

23:02.131 --> 23:04.673
- Uh... I'm on it,
send me the address.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.970
(val): Are you okay?

23:11.540 --> 23:16.118
Maybe we should go, hmm?

23:16.679 --> 23:21.065
If you want a tell cherie
how you feel...

23:22.318 --> 23:25.369
There are... There are better
ways to do that

23:25.371 --> 23:27.446
Than what you are doing here.

23:27.565 --> 23:29.298
(sniffling)

23:29.325 --> 23:31.208
- You're right.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.035
(sirens wailing)

23:33.829 --> 23:34.670
- Mark! What is going on?

23:34.672 --> 23:36.580
- I got home about
10 minutes ago.

23:36.699 --> 23:39.357
Some guy busted
in the house, alright?

23:39.377 --> 23:40.209
My kids are locked in the room.

23:40.369 --> 23:43.036
Spencer, he says a man came
in here

23:43.155 --> 23:45.038
With a rifle or a shotgun,
maybe sawed off

23:45.157 --> 23:46.557
Or something like that.
But val's not here.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.042
Val's gone! The truck's gone!

23:49.161 --> 23:50.711
- Okay, okay--
- so, he took her with him!

23:50.829 --> 23:53.246
- Mark, mark! Calm down.
We got it. We're on it, okay?

23:53.307 --> 23:55.433
Dispatch, I need more units
on wax road right away,

23:55.551 --> 23:58.202
And I need an abp out
on a vehicle.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.537
<i> - Copy that, units en route,</i>
<i> but dave...</i>

23:59.539 --> 24:01.664
- Yeah?
<i> - We need to get you back</i>

24:01.691 --> 24:03.423
<i> To cold springs bridge</i>
<i> right away.</i>

24:03.484 --> 24:05.893
- What, why? Over.
<i> - Someone's been shot.</i>

24:06.011 --> 24:09.171
<i> We're sending more units.</i>
<i> Just get on over there.</i>

24:09.198 --> 24:10.898
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

24:11.016 --> 24:11.490
I'm sorry, mark,
but I have to go.

24:11.609 --> 24:13.567
It's gonna be okay.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.203
Look, I'm going to send
more units, alright?

24:17.498 --> 24:17.746
- Hey!

24:18.749 --> 24:19.748
Bob, you can watch my kids?
- Of course.

24:20.142 --> 24:23.169
- Listen boys, I will be
right back, I promise you.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.111
(tires screeching)
listen to everything he says,

24:25.173 --> 24:26.888
You stay with him,
be right back.

24:26.890 --> 24:27.581
- Dad!

24:27.699 --> 24:30.601
- I thought I told you to leave.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.337
My stories are on.

24:33.455 --> 24:36.440
Oh... Ahh...

24:36.442 --> 24:37.516
Woo!

24:37.635 --> 24:39.760
- When is cherie coming home?

24:39.878 --> 24:43.280
Hey, please, I just...
I really need to talk to her.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.448
(laughing)

24:44.450 --> 24:46.617
- You're so stupid.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.936
- Cherie doesn't live here.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.288
She just told you that
'cause she doesn't want you

24:51.290 --> 24:52.531
To know where she's at.

24:52.650 --> 24:54.366
(laughing)

24:54.485 --> 24:57.461
Cherie doesn't want you
bothering her anymore.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.463
She's through with you.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.208
Get it your thick skull.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.319
I knew he was still alive!

25:06.380 --> 25:10.232
Oh, that bolton is sick,
I knew it, I knew, I knew it!

25:10.259 --> 25:11.567
Oh, my god.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.643
Oh, yeah, you're gonna have
to marry her now,

25:12.645 --> 25:14.887
'cause you're alive.

25:15.005 --> 25:17.147
Oh, he's so handsome.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.556
- Let's go.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.475
(tv playing)

25:19.635 --> 25:21.060
Let's go.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.556
- Yeah, you should buy her
a glass of wine, that's right.

25:25.674 --> 25:28.200
Treat her right.

25:28.202 --> 25:30.861
(soft music)

25:38.746 --> 25:40.871
(chuckles softly)

25:46.512 --> 25:48.662
(dog barking)

25:48.780 --> 25:51.549
- Is there somewhere else
we need to go or...?

25:52.951 --> 25:55.636
Can... Can I go home now?

25:56.931 --> 25:58.113
(sniffs)

25:58.140 --> 26:00.683
(heart beating)

26:08.467 --> 26:10.859
Denny, did you hear me?

26:11.653 --> 26:12.677
Can we go home now?

26:12.697 --> 26:15.614
- I have no home.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.288
(sinister music)

26:24.792 --> 26:27.868
- What are you doing?
- Give me your hand.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.570
- Ah! What are you doing?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.864
Denny, please.

26:32.883 --> 26:36.318
- Give me your other hand.
- Ah! Denny, please.

26:36.345 --> 26:36.910
Please don't do this.

26:36.971 --> 26:38.712
No! Ow, ow.
- Shh...

26:38.830 --> 26:41.381
- Why are you doing this?

26:41.541 --> 26:42.549
You don't have to do this.

26:42.668 --> 26:43.216
You don't have to do this,
denny!

26:43.335 --> 26:45.644
- I just forgot my cap.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.772
- Denny, wait!

26:49.533 --> 26:50.924
Denny!

26:50.985 --> 26:52.151
Oh!

26:52.269 --> 26:53.319
(dog barking)

26:53.437 --> 26:55.613
Oh no!

26:59.251 --> 27:00.917
(phone ringing tone)

27:00.919 --> 27:03.603
<i> - 911, can I have--</i>

27:03.664 --> 27:05.347
- Uh, yes,
this is francine bodine.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.515
I want to report--

27:06.542 --> 27:08.884
- Hi, there, uh... My mom
noticed that her neighbour

27:08.886 --> 27:10.669
Didn't bring in the trash
and uh...

27:10.788 --> 27:12.354
We were just wondering
if that's something that we

27:12.381 --> 27:14.673
Could report 'cause it's just
starting to become a little bit

27:14.792 --> 27:17.176
Of an eyesore
and starting to stink.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.620
Oh, okay.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.181
Okay.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.443
- Put that down!

27:26.445 --> 27:27.736
What is wrong with you?

27:27.738 --> 27:30.205
You're acting like a fool!

27:30.232 --> 27:31.540
(val screaming)

27:31.567 --> 27:33.417
Denny, stop it! Now!

27:33.419 --> 27:35.435
(val): Help me please!

27:35.554 --> 27:52.803
Help me!

27:52.805 --> 27:54.971
- Mark, get back
in your vehicle!

27:54.973 --> 27:55.731
- I know it's her.

27:55.758 --> 27:56.882
- It's not her.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.218
Alright, it's not val.

28:00.370 --> 28:01.720
(exhales)

28:02.490 --> 28:03.847
- Oh...

28:06.727 --> 28:08.686
Jeeze.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.404
- Ain't nothing else down here.

28:11.406 --> 28:12.981
- Where is she?

28:12.983 --> 28:15.025
Where is she?!

28:15.144 --> 28:16.843
(panting)

28:16.862 --> 28:19.405
(soft music)

28:23.736 --> 28:26.286
(whimpering)

28:27.807 --> 28:30.290
(sighing)

28:33.904 --> 28:35.462
(door slams)

28:38.968 --> 28:41.802
- What happened?
- Just got my cap.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.139
- Is she--
- just got my cap.

28:46.692 --> 28:47.832
Drive.

28:47.852 --> 28:51.011
Drive! Go!
- Okay! Okay.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.771
(engine starting)

28:54.942 --> 28:57.317
(tense music)

29:17.080 --> 29:19.631
(dave): Can you describe
the weapon?

29:19.750 --> 29:20.966
(spencer): It...

29:21.084 --> 29:25.712
...It was a big gun
but short like...

29:25.831 --> 29:30.250
Like the barrel was cut off
in the middle and um...

29:30.311 --> 29:32.235
He uh...

29:32.237 --> 29:34.070
The man, he was screaming.

29:34.072 --> 29:36.815
He just wouldn't stop,
he just kept screaming

29:36.934 --> 29:39.334
And screaming and...
- Hey, it's alright.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.195
- Then what happened?

29:42.198 --> 29:46.508
- We... We saw mom
drive away in the car.

29:46.994 --> 29:50.037
He must've been
in the car with her.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.439
Is he gonna hurt mom?
- No.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.591
No, he is not.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.668
- We won't let anything
happen to your mom.

29:56.787 --> 30:00.047
She'll be home as soon
as we find her, alright?

30:03.460 --> 30:03.842
- Come on.

30:03.961 --> 30:05.986
Sheriff, hey!

30:06.104 --> 30:08.088
Sheriff--
- the entire county

30:08.206 --> 30:09.515
Police force is on it.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.391
We'll find her, okay?

30:12.394 --> 30:13.852
- Alright, dave.

30:18.141 --> 30:21.209
- Mark, honey, what did he say?

30:21.237 --> 30:22.194
- Hey.

30:23.121 --> 30:27.215
- Oh... It'll be okay.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.216
It'll be okay.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.794
- I just feel useless, mom.

30:30.796 --> 30:31.795
- I know.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.998
- I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.252
- I've got the boys, you go, go!

30:41.348 --> 30:43.423
- Thanks, mom.
- Love you.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.230
- Keys?

31:07.024 --> 31:09.499
I'm going to win cherie back.

31:10.244 --> 31:11.167
Yeah, I think you're right.
You just...

31:11.169 --> 31:13.153
You gotta fight
for what you love.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.005
You know, I just...
I need a reminder,

31:15.007 --> 31:18.417
Just how good we can be
together, you know?

31:18.535 --> 31:19.509
And I'll clean up,

31:19.870 --> 31:22.421
I'll get a job, I can be the man
that she wants me to be.

31:22.539 --> 31:23.330
It's just...

31:23.448 --> 31:26.333
(scoffs)
I just need to get to her.

31:26.451 --> 31:27.533
I just need to get to her.

31:27.595 --> 31:28.927
If I could get to her,
she'll understand.

31:29.046 --> 31:30.536
She'll remember, you know how...

31:30.598 --> 31:32.973
How... How good
we were together.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.643
- I just want to get
home to my kids.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.104
- Well, then, get out.

31:39.222 --> 31:41.106
We're not done yet.

31:41.224 --> 31:43.984
(indistinct chatter)

31:51.059 --> 31:53.184
- Yo, denny, you're here early.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.787
Want me to set you up
on your usual end?

31:55.906 --> 31:57.030
- No, not... Not today, um...

31:57.148 --> 31:58.865
Just... I was just looking
for cherie.

31:58.984 --> 32:00.216
She coming today or...?

32:00.218 --> 32:01.960
- Nope. I'm not surprised
you guys are looking

32:02.079 --> 32:04.054
For some practice before Friday.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.556
Hands of doom are top seed.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.983
(chuckling)
- not for long.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.152
Benny's wife can't pocket
to save her life.

32:10.179 --> 32:13.546
(laughing)
- who's your friend?

32:13.665 --> 32:15.231
- Uh... She's just
helping me out

32:15.233 --> 32:17.233
With something special
for cherie.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.886
- You always were a romantic.

32:20.005 --> 32:20.979
(chuckling)

32:21.098 --> 32:23.665
- Alright, see you.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.984
I mean no matter what fights
we had out there

32:26.103 --> 32:27.593
That got us out of sync,
in here,

32:27.655 --> 32:29.762
We were always just like...
(clicks tongue)

32:29.823 --> 32:31.823
We're an amazing team.
You should've seen us play.

32:31.942 --> 32:34.493
Like we were just laughing
and drinking and...

32:34.611 --> 32:37.079
Oh god, I love
seeing her laugh!

32:37.239 --> 32:38.730
(romantic music)

32:38.749 --> 32:39.506
<i> She's just so beautiful.</i>

32:39.508 --> 32:41.833
<i> The way she'd look at me.</i>

32:41.835 --> 32:44.444
<i> Make me feel so good.</i>

32:45.030 --> 32:46.838
<i> She used to make me melt.</i>

32:46.957 --> 32:48.098
(denny laughs)

32:48.100 --> 32:49.691
Okay and even after we broke up,

32:49.718 --> 32:52.844
I mean, she wanted to, you know,
keep the bowling team together.

32:52.963 --> 32:54.179
- Denny, please,

32:54.297 --> 32:56.589
Can I just make a phone call?

32:56.708 --> 32:59.017
Can I make sure
that my kids are okay?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.019
- Yeah, alright, make it quick.

33:01.138 --> 33:03.563
- Thank you.

33:10.956 --> 33:11.771
(spencer):<i> Hello?</i>

33:11.890 --> 33:14.140
- Spencer.
<i> - Mom, where are you?</i>

33:14.201 --> 33:16.109
<i> Are you okay?</i>

33:16.227 --> 33:17.444
- I'm fine, are you guys okay?

33:17.562 --> 33:20.797
<i> - Mom, the police are here,</i>
<i> everyone's looking for you.</i>

33:20.799 --> 33:21.781
<i> Where are you?</i>

33:21.900 --> 33:24.451
- Uh, listen,
everything's going to be fine.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.152
I am going to be
home soon and...

33:26.213 --> 33:28.304
And we are going to have
the best christmas ever.

33:28.306 --> 33:32.551
We are going to bake cookies
and, and pie and it's just--

33:32.669 --> 33:33.326
- Alright, that's enough.
That's enough.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.554
- I love you.
- Come on.

33:35.672 --> 33:37.264
(phone clicks)

33:39.009 --> 33:40.183
Hang it up.

33:41.344 --> 33:44.154
Christmas dinner?
That sounds so nice.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.606
Maybe me and cherie can come.

33:48.843 --> 33:50.676
(phone ringing)

33:50.738 --> 33:52.328
- Waterdrop nursing home,
how may I help you?

33:52.330 --> 33:55.165
- Hi, uh... Is uh, jessica?

33:55.167 --> 33:58.151
- Denny... You know we're not
supposed to take personal calls

33:58.269 --> 34:00.078
During work hours.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

34:00.197 --> 34:02.338
I know, I was just... Is...
Is, uh...

34:02.340 --> 34:04.099
Is cherie...?
Is she in there today or...?

34:04.126 --> 34:07.494
- No, she's already gone.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.463
Don't call again, okay?

34:13.351 --> 34:14.867
- What did he say?

34:14.928 --> 34:16.261
- What do you think?
Same thing as always.

34:16.379 --> 34:19.306
Trying to track you down.

34:20.358 --> 34:23.643
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah.

34:24.796 --> 34:27.731
- I should just
let it be over, right?

34:28.942 --> 34:31.276
Yes, right, right.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.154
Right?

34:46.051 --> 34:47.667
- You did end it, right?

34:49.129 --> 34:50.504
- Yeah.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.507
Yes.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.802
Told him I moved in with my mom

34:56.920 --> 34:59.679
So he doesn't know
where I live anymore.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.517
- Maybe get rid of those too?

35:10.475 --> 35:13.318
(soft music)

35:48.046 --> 35:50.113
- Hey, if he calls again,
can you just--

35:50.115 --> 35:51.130
- I already know the drill.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.448
This isn't the first time
I've run interference

35:52.450 --> 35:56.044
Between you and denny, okay?

35:56.071 --> 35:58.572
I just hope it's the last.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.576
You can do so much better.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.962
I'm trying.

36:05.964 --> 36:06.462
- So, what do you think?

36:06.464 --> 36:08.723
- About what?

36:09.326 --> 36:11.226
- About cherie keeping
the bowling team together

36:11.253 --> 36:12.468
Even after we broke up.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.421
- Oh.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.257
- I mean, it means she still
loves me, right?

36:18.476 --> 36:19.926
Here, look.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.570
Check this out.

36:22.598 --> 36:23.763
Ah...

36:24.725 --> 36:27.150
Where is it? Where is it?
Oh, look.

36:27.152 --> 36:30.153
Okay, we used to have this
little pregame ritual.

36:30.155 --> 36:32.355
(laughing)
it was so fun.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.901
(thudding)
ahh!

36:38.555 --> 36:40.179
(tense music)

36:40.240 --> 36:41.907
(panting)

36:48.207 --> 36:49.447
(panicked whimpering)

36:49.565 --> 36:51.708
- Ahh, come on, come on.

37:04.747 --> 37:07.474
(door opens and closes)

37:09.386 --> 37:10.769
(sniffing)

37:10.887 --> 37:12.979
(panting)

37:15.225 --> 37:17.275
- You want to see
your kids again?

37:19.371 --> 37:23.114
Do you?!
- Yes.

37:23.233 --> 37:24.950
More than anything.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.495
(panting, sniffing)

37:36.079 --> 37:38.672
- Don't do that again.

37:45.522 --> 37:46.354
(engine starting)

37:46.356 --> 37:49.307
- Where do you want to go?

37:51.169 --> 37:53.478
- Everybody lies...

37:54.431 --> 37:57.023
(tense music)

38:03.606 --> 38:06.032
(indistinct chatter)

38:15.234 --> 38:17.335
(tense music)

38:37.449 --> 38:40.116
(sighing)

38:40.118 --> 38:41.735
I bet she's in there.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.740
Oh...
(chuckles)

38:49.461 --> 38:51.794
How do you...
How do you tell your husband

38:51.796 --> 38:54.581
Like, how much you love him?
(clears throat)

38:55.633 --> 38:58.226
Like how do you...

38:58.253 --> 38:59.469
How do you...

38:59.471 --> 39:03.089
How do you say that to him?

39:06.219 --> 39:08.345
- Um...

39:10.815 --> 39:12.432
I um...

39:13.318 --> 39:14.650
I take care of little things

39:14.652 --> 39:17.854
So he doesn't have to.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.566
Like uh...

39:21.684 --> 39:24.009
Sewing the holes in his socks

39:24.071 --> 39:26.496
Before he even knows
they're there.

39:26.597 --> 39:27.980
(chuckles)

39:28.099 --> 39:30.617
I try to make him feel special.

39:32.695 --> 39:36.155
<i> Plan time for just</i>
<i> the two of us</i>

39:36.274 --> 39:40.043
<i> Even when it's crazy</i>
<i> with the kids.</i>

39:43.039 --> 39:44.680
<i> Sometimes...</i>

39:44.682 --> 39:48.134
People forget how much
they love each other.

39:49.620 --> 39:53.506
Life, you know?

39:53.624 --> 39:55.100
Gets in the way.

39:56.553 --> 39:59.979
You focus on other things and...

40:02.133 --> 40:05.068
Those feelings,
they... They get lost.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.990
If you love her...

40:12.977 --> 40:16.913
Try and get her to see you...

40:18.241 --> 40:20.500
The way you see her.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.405
- I do love her.

40:26.891 --> 40:31.285
- Just, denny, please,
don't hurt anyone.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.639
- I never want to hurt anyone.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.522
Let's go.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.922
- And we got an abp
on the vehicle

40:59.924 --> 41:01.774
So maybe we'll get lucky,
but in case we don't,

41:01.835 --> 41:03.576
We need check points
on every highway and dirt road

41:03.694 --> 41:06.187
Out of this county.

41:06.623 --> 41:07.571
Sheriff jones is gonna walk

41:07.591 --> 41:10.282
Everybody through
the assignments.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.185
- Okay, here's what we got.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.438
We need checkpoints
here and here.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.514
- I'm sorry, I just couldn't
stay in my house.

41:16.633 --> 41:19.291
- It's okay.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.034
The body's been identified.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.611
His name was frank doheny.

41:21.613 --> 41:25.373
His girlfriend said that frank
left early this morning

41:25.400 --> 41:26.432
With a friend named denny.

41:26.551 --> 41:27.600
Her description of him

41:27.718 --> 41:28.735
Matches the one your son gave.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.638
- Well, how the hell
did he end up at our house?

41:32.699 --> 41:34.457
- We're not sure.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.609
I tried to start that truck,
but it wouldn't turn over.

41:36.727 --> 41:40.646
So, it's possible
that after denny ki--

41:41.249 --> 41:42.615
After the vehicle's owner
was deceased,

41:42.733 --> 41:45.210
Denny tried to take the truck,

41:45.328 --> 41:47.987
But it wouldn't start,
so he took off on foot.

41:48.048 --> 41:51.474
I mean, your house just
happened to be the closest.

41:51.476 --> 41:52.825
I'm sorry,

41:52.886 --> 41:54.994
But look, that doesn't mean

41:55.055 --> 41:55.628
That this guy's done
anything to val.

41:55.746 --> 41:58.056
- Oh, yeah, you think?

41:58.174 --> 41:59.632
Guy blew a hole
through his friend,

41:59.750 --> 42:01.935
What do you think
he can do to val?

42:04.681 --> 42:07.106
(door opens)

42:08.868 --> 42:11.744
- Denny, come on, man.

42:11.746 --> 42:13.104
- I know, I know.

42:13.222 --> 42:14.680
I just need to talk to cherie.

42:14.799 --> 42:16.649
- Then call her,
like a normal person.

42:16.767 --> 42:18.818
You can't keep
showing up here like this.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.169
It's weird and creepy.

42:20.530 --> 42:23.856
You need to stop acting
like such a psychopath, okay?

42:23.917 --> 42:25.157
- You need to listen to me.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.751
- I already told you,
she isn't here.

42:26.869 --> 42:28.861
- I don't think
that you understand.

42:28.922 --> 42:31.030
- Wait, uh... I get it.

42:31.091 --> 42:32.665
Nobody wants to get bothered
at work,

42:32.783 --> 42:40.523
But we are here on official
bowling team business uh...

42:40.525 --> 42:42.692
We need to find cherie
because we are playing

42:42.694 --> 42:45.528
The hands of doom this weekend

42:45.530 --> 42:48.289
And uh... They are top seed.

42:48.725 --> 42:50.700
- Well, I don't know anything

42:50.702 --> 42:51.609
About your little
bowling thing, okay?

42:51.728 --> 42:54.053
But she's not here.

42:54.114 --> 42:56.539
- Okay, we'll figure it out.

42:56.541 --> 42:57.615
We'll figure it out.
- Great.

42:57.734 --> 43:00.543
- We'll figure it out, okay?

43:00.545 --> 43:01.995
Come on.

43:04.315 --> 43:08.001
- Thanks. Cherie, she hates it
when I fight with her friends.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.297
You know what?
Come on.

43:12.415 --> 43:13.923
Come here.

43:15.135 --> 43:16.968
(tense music)

43:25.770 --> 43:27.954
(gasps)
I knew it!

43:27.981 --> 43:30.640
I knew it! She was here
just like a half an hour ago.

43:30.758 --> 43:34.201
She was just here!

43:34.871 --> 43:36.779
I knew it! I knew it!
She was just here like--

43:36.898 --> 43:37.763
What are you...
Where are you going?

43:37.782 --> 43:40.867
- I'm just keeping watch.

43:45.089 --> 43:46.564
- Okay.

43:46.566 --> 43:47.874
(clattering)

43:56.217 --> 43:58.158
Oh, yes!

43:58.478 --> 43:59.585
Got it!

43:59.704 --> 44:01.179
Okay.

44:03.516 --> 44:04.807
Okay.

44:06.594 --> 44:08.353
Okay, let's go.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.230
(ominous music)

44:19.457 --> 44:21.074
(denny sighing)

44:22.369 --> 44:24.035
Alright, let's go.

44:27.898 --> 44:28.906
- What are y'all
doing back here?

44:29.024 --> 44:31.801
- You lied to me!
- You need to leave!

44:31.919 --> 44:33.452
- Know what happened
to the last person

44:33.612 --> 44:34.954
Who lied to me about cherie?

44:34.956 --> 44:36.939
- I've had enough! You need
to leave, I'm calling the cops.

44:36.941 --> 44:38.549
(laughing)
- you should try being a little

44:38.668 --> 44:40.718
More thoughtful when someone
comes looking for a loved on.

44:40.837 --> 44:42.720
Try using your eyes.

44:42.839 --> 44:45.056
Can't you see
what's happening here?

44:45.174 --> 44:47.207
Someone needs your help.

44:47.752 --> 44:49.268
- Let's go, come on!

44:58.479 --> 45:00.113
(phone dialling)

45:01.499 --> 45:02.314
<i> - 911.</i>

45:02.433 --> 45:05.000
- Yes, I need
to report something.

45:05.002 --> 45:07.453
(indistinct chatter)

45:08.489 --> 45:09.447
- Dave?

45:09.565 --> 45:11.073
- Just got a call.
Denny's been spotted.

45:11.075 --> 45:12.524
- But did they spot val?
Is she okay?

45:12.585 --> 45:14.669
- We're not sure, I'll let you
know when we do, okay?

45:14.829 --> 45:16.963
- Let me know nothing,
I'm coming with you.

45:18.833 --> 45:21.884
(tense music)

45:32.463 --> 45:35.122
- What's going on?
Where's mom?

45:35.150 --> 45:37.792
- Sweetheart, you father's
gonna find her.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.445
They'll both be home soon.

45:40.563 --> 45:41.854
They will.

45:41.972 --> 45:44.365
It's going to be okay. Spencer?

45:44.525 --> 45:45.992
Spencer?

45:47.737 --> 45:49.912
(soft music)

45:57.914 --> 45:59.630
- Grandma,

45:59.749 --> 46:01.632
Can we make cookies?

46:01.751 --> 46:03.843
We should have them ready
before mom comes home.

46:05.329 --> 46:07.305
- Can we please, pretty please?

46:07.423 --> 46:10.641
- Honey, that's a great idea.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.935
Let's make cookies.

46:15.431 --> 46:18.024
(tense music)

46:38.671 --> 46:39.595
(sighing)

46:39.597 --> 46:41.413
- They'll be looking
for us by now.

46:41.532 --> 46:43.599
You know, we gotta wait
until it's dark.

46:43.601 --> 46:45.968
It'll be easier
to move around then.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.308
(papers rustling)

46:58.307 --> 47:00.358
(laughing)

47:01.077 --> 47:05.546
I... Oh, I knew it.
I knew it.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.940
Not one other date
in two months.

47:08.058 --> 47:09.959
Two months!

47:10.394 --> 47:12.078
You know what that means, right?

47:13.022 --> 47:13.921
You get it?

47:13.923 --> 47:15.447
This... I mean this girl,

47:15.566 --> 47:17.542
She is beautiful,
she could get a date

47:17.660 --> 47:19.785
With any guy, any time.

47:19.904 --> 47:21.303
She still loves me.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.089
She still loves me.

47:24.308 --> 47:25.975
- Now that you know
that she still loves you,

47:25.977 --> 47:29.737
Maybe this isn't
the right approach,

47:29.764 --> 47:31.055
Because what you're doing,

47:31.173 --> 47:34.333
It could drive her away.

47:34.394 --> 47:38.470
Maybe she just needs some space.
Just for a while, hmm?

47:38.589 --> 47:40.915
- I know my girl.
I know my girl, no.

47:40.942 --> 47:44.827
Too much distance does not make
the heart grow fonder, okay?

47:44.829 --> 47:47.162
No, she needs to feel loved.

47:47.164 --> 47:49.590
- But denny,
what about the pictures?

47:50.076 --> 47:51.050
- I mean,
look how happy we look!

47:51.077 --> 47:53.427
Look how happy we look!

47:53.454 --> 47:55.763
Look at it,
don't we look happy?

47:55.790 --> 47:57.006
- Yeah, you do.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.292
- That's...
That's 'cause we were.

48:00.110 --> 48:01.919
We took this trip to california,

48:02.038 --> 48:04.814
<i> We called it our honeymoon,</i>

48:04.932 --> 48:07.182
And we would just walk
the beach every day,

48:07.184 --> 48:11.203
And we got like,
the sand between our toes and...

48:11.264 --> 48:12.871
The water was so sparkly.

48:12.932 --> 48:15.858
<i> Cherie would say it looked</i>
<i> like dancing angels.</i>

48:15.860 --> 48:18.761
<i> And we would watch</i>
<i> that green flash uh...</i>

48:18.879 --> 48:19.711
That's...

48:19.772 --> 48:21.680
Oh, over in the pacific
they have...

48:21.799 --> 48:23.715
Do you know there's like
this green flash,

48:23.776 --> 48:26.352
Like, the sun comes down,
and then it goes like, pfft!

48:26.470 --> 48:27.219
And it flashes.
- Oh, yeah.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.705
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

48:29.707 --> 48:30.965
- Yeah.

48:31.326 --> 48:33.284
It was at pismo beach.

48:33.402 --> 48:39.381
Which is the clam capital
of the world, the world!

48:39.383 --> 48:40.958
- Mm-hmm.

48:41.385 --> 48:43.293
- We always said
that we'd go back there.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.554
<i> I even have the postcard</i>
<i> that cherie gave me.</i>

48:45.556 --> 48:48.057
<i> The exact spot. And uh...</i>

48:48.301 --> 48:51.819
It was just the best
week of our lives.

48:52.088 --> 48:53.078
- But denny,

48:53.139 --> 48:56.565
She put the pictures
in the trash.

48:56.567 --> 48:58.801
- Yeah, but you don't know that.

48:58.919 --> 49:01.586
That could've been a janitor
or that lying nurse.

49:01.648 --> 49:02.480
I mean...

49:02.598 --> 49:05.557
You saw her,
there was always people

49:05.676 --> 49:07.409
Trying to interfere
in our relationship.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.487
Always trying to get between us.

49:10.198 --> 49:13.098
No, we're... We're going
to go back to pismo,

49:13.159 --> 49:15.234
You know,
we'll have our honeymoon.

49:15.352 --> 49:19.847
I'll get a job, you know,
everything will be great.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.999
Everything will be great.

49:22.118 --> 49:24.776
I just... I have to...
I just have to get to her.

49:24.837 --> 49:25.836
I have to get near her.

49:25.955 --> 49:28.381
I have to talk to her,
get her to understand.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.358
And that's... I mean, that's...
I think that's why

49:31.386 --> 49:35.587
We were brought like, together.
You know what I mean?

49:35.706 --> 49:38.557
Like fate. Fate!

49:38.676 --> 49:41.176
(tv playing)

49:41.295 --> 49:45.314
(dial tone beeping)

49:55.868 --> 49:56.475
- Mom!

49:56.536 --> 49:59.078
I brought your mail in.

50:06.070 --> 50:07.586
Mom?

50:10.333 --> 50:13.092
(tv turns off)

50:16.580 --> 50:18.180
Mom?

50:20.693 --> 50:23.026
(tense music)

50:23.028 --> 50:25.271
(dial tone beeping)

50:41.363 --> 50:43.672
Mom?

50:43.674 --> 50:45.023
(heart beating)

50:45.084 --> 50:46.292
(gasps)

50:51.207 --> 50:55.092
(soft music playing)

51:07.723 --> 51:10.199
(tense music)

51:10.317 --> 51:12.793
- Yeah, he came here
with a woman.

51:12.820 --> 51:13.294
- Um...

51:13.321 --> 51:16.038
Was that her?

51:16.040 --> 51:17.948
- Yeah, that's her.

51:17.950 --> 51:18.457
- Was she okay?

51:18.459 --> 51:20.467
- She seemed fine.

51:20.495 --> 51:21.893
- What do you mean by fine?

51:21.954 --> 51:23.804
Was she scared,
was she hurt, was she--

51:23.831 --> 51:25.331
- Mark.

51:28.077 --> 51:29.218
- How was her disposition?

51:29.220 --> 51:32.387
- Um, it was a little weird
at first,

51:32.389 --> 51:34.465
But she actually helped
calm down that piece of crap.

51:34.583 --> 51:36.892
The orderlies were
gonna kick him out of here,

51:36.894 --> 51:38.210
But she stepped in.

51:38.328 --> 51:40.805
- Val did that?

51:40.923 --> 51:42.564
- Yeah, good thing too.

51:42.566 --> 51:43.715
We didn't even know he was armed

51:43.834 --> 51:46.227
Until we saw him
leave the building.

51:48.338 --> 51:50.389
- Did you see
the weapon clearly?

51:50.507 --> 51:54.193
- Yes, it was a sawed-off
shotgun underneath his jacket.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.738
- Thank you so much.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.992
- Um... Excuse me.

52:02.111 --> 52:03.585
She dropped this.

52:03.587 --> 52:05.788
I'm pretty sure it's for you.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.834
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

52:18.052 --> 52:22.555
- "mark, I love you so much.

52:23.540 --> 52:25.516
Take care of the kids."

52:26.894 --> 52:28.144
I wish...

52:30.565 --> 52:31.522
I wish.

52:34.418 --> 52:36.210
- We got units concentrating
their efforts here,

52:36.237 --> 52:38.379
And checkpoints all over
this county.

52:38.406 --> 52:40.881
He's not going anywhere.

52:40.908 --> 52:44.702
And that uh...
That wife of yours is a hero.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.222
- Yeah, val's some
kind of woman.

52:48.249 --> 52:51.709
I mean, she don't hesitate
to put herself in harms way

52:51.827 --> 52:54.461
To protect a complete stranger.

52:56.307 --> 52:57.715
But I'll tell you right now,

52:57.833 --> 53:00.792
I just want her to do enough
to protect herself, you know?

53:00.911 --> 53:02.219
- We'll find him.

53:02.338 --> 53:04.238
<i> - Sergeant, you there? Over.</i>

53:04.265 --> 53:06.240
- Yeah, go for corbin, over.

53:06.267 --> 53:07.241
<i> - We need you</i>
<i> at a new location.</i>

53:07.268 --> 53:10.319
<i>Another body's been discovered.</i>

53:10.321 --> 53:12.813
- On my way.

53:18.104 --> 53:19.302
(denny): Yes, yes, yes!

53:19.422 --> 53:22.198
This is it.
This is where she has to be.

53:22.316 --> 53:23.457
Look, the motel address
right there.

53:23.459 --> 53:25.910
This is where she has to be.

53:26.028 --> 53:27.578
We could just go there.

53:29.031 --> 53:32.174
- If she is there, then what?

53:32.176 --> 53:33.250
- Then I'll tell her how I feel.

53:33.369 --> 53:35.543
Go to california!

53:35.545 --> 53:39.014
I'll live happily ever after!

53:39.016 --> 53:40.274
(laughing)

53:40.301 --> 53:42.776
- And me?

53:42.803 --> 53:44.353
- Oh, you can go.

53:44.355 --> 53:47.473
(laughing)
you can go...

53:48.458 --> 53:50.768
(tense music)

53:51.553 --> 53:53.312
Why are we on empty?

53:54.365 --> 53:56.440
Why are we on empty?
- Um...

53:56.558 --> 53:57.849
- You said you were never
going to lie to me again.

53:57.968 --> 54:00.277
- I... I didn't lie.
- You said you were never
lie to me again.

54:00.396 --> 54:02.629
Why are we on empty?
- I didn't lie.

54:02.657 --> 54:05.132
- Yes, you did lie to me,
you want us to run out of gas!

54:05.159 --> 54:06.858
You wanted us to run
out of gas, didn't you?

54:06.977 --> 54:08.694
(overlapping shouting)
- yes. I did want to!

54:08.812 --> 54:09.954
I did want to run out of gas

54:10.072 --> 54:11.546
Because I can't keep driving
you around,

54:11.548 --> 54:15.384
Watching you hurt people!

54:15.577 --> 54:17.311
(laughing)

54:17.338 --> 54:19.362
- Drive! Drive!

54:19.482 --> 54:21.315
You drive now!

54:21.342 --> 54:23.875
You drive now!
We need gas!

54:23.994 --> 54:25.118
Go get the gas!

54:25.279 --> 54:26.411
Go get the gas!

54:26.430 --> 54:28.079
Go get the gas!

54:28.140 --> 54:29.890
(tense music)

54:51.380 --> 54:52.329
(sighing)

54:52.448 --> 54:54.456
Okay, give me some money,
hurry up.

54:55.259 --> 54:57.259
- I don't have any money.

54:57.261 --> 54:57.942
(sighing)

54:58.004 --> 54:59.594
I didn't bring anything with me.

54:59.596 --> 55:02.548
- Okay, give me the keys.

55:05.035 --> 55:08.028
Alright, don't move.
- No, wait!

55:08.055 --> 55:09.438
Uh... I'll do it.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.266
I'll... I'll talk to him,
I can do it.

55:16.546 --> 55:19.373
- Alright, no funny business,
or people get hurt.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.817
- Okay.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.153
- Hey ya.

55:42.214 --> 55:43.547
- Hey.

55:43.665 --> 55:45.374
- I'll take one of these

55:45.492 --> 55:48.310
And 30 on pump six.

55:48.312 --> 55:50.471
- Alright.

55:52.582 --> 55:55.576
- Oh my... I um...

55:55.603 --> 55:59.388
I think I left
my wallet at home.

55:59.506 --> 56:01.065
(chuckles)

56:01.183 --> 56:02.524
Oh, duh.

56:04.261 --> 56:06.161
Oh jeez, you know what?

56:06.163 --> 56:08.072
I am right on empty,

56:08.190 --> 56:09.573
I only live five miles
from here,

56:09.691 --> 56:11.950
But I don't think I have
enough to get home.

56:12.069 --> 56:15.579
I hate to ask this,
but is there any way

56:15.697 --> 56:16.980
You can spot me the gas?

56:16.999 --> 56:19.825
I'll go home and be back
in 15 minutes.

56:19.943 --> 56:22.436
- Listen lady, this is
a gas station, it's not a bank.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.863
- What's your name, jimmy?

56:24.924 --> 56:25.589
Jimmy...

56:25.707 --> 56:27.866
I got two little kids at home

56:27.927 --> 56:30.611
And I need to get back
or they're gonna be scared.

56:30.638 --> 56:32.613
- What do you want me
to do here?

56:32.640 --> 56:36.266
You give me money,
I give you gas.

56:36.385 --> 56:38.477
That's how this works.

56:38.962 --> 56:40.270
- Jim...

56:40.389 --> 56:46.518
I want you to take a long
hard look at yourself, hmm?

56:46.636 --> 56:48.779
- Are you, like,
serious right now?

56:48.897 --> 56:51.507
- Mmm. Yeah, you see this guy?

56:51.625 --> 56:53.859
Look, are you looking at him?

56:53.977 --> 56:55.043
- Yeah.
- Look at him.

56:55.045 --> 56:56.453
- Yeah, okay.
- Look at him.

56:56.572 --> 56:58.122
- Okay.
- Now, you tell me.

56:58.240 --> 57:01.975
Is he going to be
a pompous jerk today,

57:02.002 --> 57:06.797
Or is he going to do
something good?

57:06.915 --> 57:10.392
Something special to help a mom

57:10.394 --> 57:14.805
Get home to her two kids
before they are scared.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.732
(scoffs)
- okay, okay, fine.

57:17.734 --> 57:20.519
Fine, I'll put 30
on pump six, happy?

57:22.698 --> 57:24.481
- Merry christmas.

57:24.600 --> 57:27.526
- We broke up a few weeks ago.

57:28.945 --> 57:30.863
Denny's always been troubled.

57:31.848 --> 57:33.582
His mom ran out on him
and his brother,

57:33.584 --> 57:37.828
And his dad was really abusive.

57:38.706 --> 57:42.257
You know, he was in and out
of foster care...

57:42.835 --> 57:45.878
And he ended up
at an all boys' home.

57:47.789 --> 57:49.247
When he joined the army,

57:49.366 --> 57:51.082
It only lasted a few months

57:51.201 --> 57:54.118
Before he was dishonourably
discharged.

57:54.630 --> 57:57.698
There was an incident.

57:57.725 --> 58:01.727
A violent incident between
him and another serviceman.

58:31.734 --> 58:34.593
- Your denny's girl, huh?

58:36.722 --> 58:38.597
- Used to be.

58:40.509 --> 58:42.059
- You're the husband?

58:44.254 --> 58:45.604
- Yep.

58:51.019 --> 58:52.736
- I hate him too, you know?

58:55.999 --> 58:57.783
Biggest mistake of my life.

58:59.169 --> 58:59.701
- Yep.

59:00.937 --> 59:02.913
- His mom abandoned him,

59:03.031 --> 59:04.431
And his dad used to beat him,

59:04.458 --> 59:06.024
And then he was in
the foster-care system,

59:06.085 --> 59:09.360
And then he joined the army,
and that was a disaster.

59:09.421 --> 59:10.879
- I don't care.

59:13.950 --> 59:14.849
He killed your mom.

59:14.851 --> 59:17.002
Now he's driving
around somewhere

59:17.120 --> 59:19.137
With a gun to my wife's head.

59:23.719 --> 59:24.977
- I'm sorry.

59:28.649 --> 59:31.942
- How'd you end up
with a guy like that?

59:33.203 --> 59:35.821
- He wasn't always like that.

59:38.208 --> 59:41.952
He looked at me like no one
ever looked at me before.

59:44.814 --> 59:47.583
Do you know what it's like
to be loved like that?

59:48.669 --> 59:51.003
To be needed like that?

59:54.916 --> 59:57.651
- Hey, mark, you two
can't be talking.

59:58.137 --> 1:00:00.846
We got a few more
questions for you anyways.

1:00:03.017 --> 1:00:04.266
- Right.

1:00:10.741 --> 1:00:15.319
I am sorry about your mother.

1:00:16.605 --> 1:00:18.196
I'm sorry.

1:00:36.433 --> 1:00:38.050
(sighing)

1:00:39.928 --> 1:00:42.012
(insects chirping)

1:00:59.889 --> 1:01:01.823
(chuckling)

1:01:25.599 --> 1:01:26.932
Yeah.

1:01:32.989 --> 1:01:38.009
- If you find him,
are you going to hurt him?

1:01:38.070 --> 1:01:40.779
- Not if we don't have to.

1:01:43.742 --> 1:01:44.908
- I might know how to help.

1:01:45.026 --> 1:01:48.286
- Do you know where he's going?

1:01:49.339 --> 1:01:51.039
- No.

1:01:52.509 --> 1:01:54.751
But he'll come for me.

1:01:55.629 --> 1:01:57.421
He always does.

1:02:10.552 --> 1:02:13.377
(eerie music)

1:02:13.539 --> 1:02:16.064
(owl hooting)

1:02:32.816 --> 1:02:34.499
- She lives right there.

1:02:36.411 --> 1:02:38.503
I bet she's in there right now.

1:02:43.226 --> 1:02:46.845
- You can't just March right in
there with a shotgun.

1:02:52.402 --> 1:02:53.852
- Keys?

1:03:21.932 --> 1:03:24.883
(phone ringing tone)

1:03:27.604 --> 1:03:29.054
<i> (cherie): Hello?</i>

1:03:31.350 --> 1:03:32.015
<i> Hello?</i>

1:03:32.133 --> 1:03:34.943
- Cherie, it's me, it's denny.

1:03:34.945 --> 1:03:38.063
- Denny, hi.

1:03:39.282 --> 1:03:41.358
It's good to hear your voice.

1:03:42.352 --> 1:03:45.237
<i>How are you, how are you doing?</i>

1:03:46.890 --> 1:03:48.406
- I'm uh...

1:03:49.484 --> 1:03:50.075
I'm really good.

1:03:51.703 --> 1:03:55.080
I'm just... I've just been
thinking about you so much.

1:03:56.299 --> 1:03:57.874
- Yeah?

1:03:58.710 --> 1:04:01.086
I've been thinking
about you too.

1:04:01.905 --> 1:04:03.088
<i> - Really?</i>

1:04:03.865 --> 1:04:06.474
Ah. Oh man.
(sniffling)

1:04:06.476 --> 1:04:08.459
(laughing)

1:04:08.578 --> 1:04:10.661
Um...

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:11.963
<i> - Denny?</i>

1:04:12.081 --> 1:04:14.391
- No, I just...

1:04:14.509 --> 1:04:16.985
I have so much I want to say.

1:04:16.987 --> 1:04:19.104
- Me too.

1:04:20.089 --> 1:04:22.440
Why don't we get
together and talk?

1:04:23.685 --> 1:04:25.277
I miss you.

1:04:25.929 --> 1:04:27.145
(chuckles)

1:04:27.263 --> 1:04:30.949
- Oh god, it feels really good
to hear you say that.

1:04:32.936 --> 1:04:36.096
I um... I have this trip planned

1:04:36.123 --> 1:04:38.689
And you're gonna like it.

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:41.418
It's our favourite
place in the whole world.

1:04:42.254 --> 1:04:44.178
- Sounds really good, denny.

1:04:44.180 --> 1:04:47.181
- You know the one, right?

1:04:47.183 --> 1:04:51.094
Come on, let me hear you say it.
(chuckling)

1:04:51.212 --> 1:04:52.112
Come on.
(laughing)

1:04:52.139 --> 1:04:55.189
<i> Please let me just</i>
<i> hear you say it.</i>

1:04:56.051 --> 1:04:56.933
- Yeah, why don't we...
Why don't we get together

1:04:57.052 --> 1:05:00.312
And we can talk travel plans?

1:05:01.106 --> 1:05:02.606
Where are you?

1:05:02.724 --> 1:05:04.441
I'll come get you.

1:05:04.559 --> 1:05:06.318
(whirring)

1:05:18.147 --> 1:05:21.333
- Cherie, you know
I love you, right?

1:05:21.835 --> 1:05:23.501
- I know you do.

1:05:24.913 --> 1:05:26.338
Where are you?

1:05:32.395 --> 1:05:34.512
- You still love me, right?

1:05:35.974 --> 1:05:37.432
<i> - Of course.</i>

1:05:38.401 --> 1:05:41.144
<i> Just tell me where you are.</i>

1:05:53.775 --> 1:05:54.248
Line's dead.

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:56.084
- Got it.

1:05:56.086 --> 1:05:58.912
- He's on this block.

1:05:59.072 --> 1:06:00.805
Everybody downstairs now!

1:06:00.807 --> 1:06:02.548
Go, go, go!

1:06:02.550 --> 1:06:03.257
(tense music)

1:06:03.376 --> 1:06:06.127
(crying)

1:06:25.974 --> 1:06:27.232
- Let's go.

1:06:34.841 --> 1:06:36.741
(engine starting)

1:06:39.845 --> 1:06:42.539
(engine revving)

1:06:55.470 --> 1:06:57.995
- Can I get you anything else?

1:06:58.056 --> 1:07:00.098
- No, thanks.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.450
- What chapter are you on?

1:07:20.269 --> 1:07:21.119
- Chapter 2.

1:07:22.605 --> 1:07:25.506
He just cut down
the cherry tree.

1:07:25.508 --> 1:07:29.294
- Oh yeah, I remember that.

1:07:31.006 --> 1:07:33.131
You want to read to me?

1:07:35.877 --> 1:07:42.173
- I did not cut down
that cherry tree.

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:45.727
- Good job. Alright...

1:07:47.296 --> 1:07:49.773
(soft music)

1:07:54.204 --> 1:07:57.655
(insects chirping)

1:08:07.242 --> 1:08:11.461
- I'm sorry.
- I don't need your pity.

1:08:21.973 --> 1:08:22.822
(crying)

1:08:22.849 --> 1:08:26.351
It just if she doesn't
love me...

1:08:28.313 --> 1:08:30.188
What's the point?

1:08:31.407 --> 1:08:35.076
And I'm not going
back in a cell.

1:08:35.078 --> 1:08:36.694
I've done that.

1:08:37.989 --> 1:08:41.533
I'd rather die here
on the streets just fighting.

1:08:43.203 --> 1:08:46.663
(denny breathing heavily)

1:08:46.781 --> 1:08:48.540
This is it.

1:08:49.425 --> 1:08:53.211
There is nothing left for me.

1:09:01.346 --> 1:09:03.721
- Mark and me
went on a honeymoon.

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:08.276
To victoria island.

1:09:08.469 --> 1:09:10.203
It was so elegant.

1:09:10.230 --> 1:09:13.189
European almost.

1:09:13.308 --> 1:09:16.467
We went sailing during the day

1:09:16.528 --> 1:09:21.364
And ate ice cream walking
along the harbour at night.

1:09:23.243 --> 1:09:25.910
The way he looked at me...

1:09:27.247 --> 1:09:32.584
As if time stopped
just for the two of us.

1:09:35.213 --> 1:09:37.154
But that was a long time ago

1:09:37.215 --> 1:09:38.289
Before...

1:09:38.407 --> 1:09:42.677
Kids and jobs
and a mortgage.

1:09:43.722 --> 1:09:45.346
- Life.

1:09:46.507 --> 1:09:48.966
- It gets in the way.

1:09:49.085 --> 1:09:50.602
You forget...

1:09:51.730 --> 1:09:55.306
What you love
and why even if...

1:09:55.424 --> 1:09:58.976
Even if every day, it's standing

1:09:59.095 --> 1:10:01.529
Right in front of you
when you wake up.

1:10:06.861 --> 1:10:08.286
For christmas...

1:10:09.414 --> 1:10:12.323
I thought I could get mark
something that would

1:10:12.441 --> 1:10:15.585
Make him remember...

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:18.846
How he used to look at me.

1:10:18.848 --> 1:10:23.801
How precious time is,
how it shouldn't be wasted.

1:10:27.474 --> 1:10:29.933
- What did you get him?

1:10:31.386 --> 1:10:33.010
- A watch.

1:10:33.129 --> 1:10:34.646
(chuckles)

1:10:35.298 --> 1:10:35.696
(scoffs)

1:10:35.698 --> 1:10:38.566
(laughing)

1:10:41.896 --> 1:10:42.820
(chuckles)

1:10:44.707 --> 1:10:47.617
- Denny, I don't even know
if my husband loves me anymore,

1:10:47.735 --> 1:10:49.452
But I do know that all I want,

1:10:49.570 --> 1:10:52.697
All I want right now

1:10:52.815 --> 1:10:56.668
Is to get home to
him and my boys.

1:11:03.393 --> 1:11:08.346
- You do what I say for just
a little while longer, and...

1:11:10.566 --> 1:11:14.269
(sighing)
I promise I'll take you home.

1:11:17.907 --> 1:11:19.524
Alright?

1:11:20.910 --> 1:11:22.360
- Okay.

1:11:24.013 --> 1:11:25.321
Okay.

1:11:30.586 --> 1:11:32.328
- Alright, drive.

1:11:32.447 --> 1:11:35.707
(tense music)

1:11:36.451 --> 1:11:39.002
- Where are we going?

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:40.628
- It's right up here.

1:11:43.258 --> 1:11:45.300
Just keep going.

1:11:51.441 --> 1:11:54.258
(insects chirping)

1:11:54.377 --> 1:11:56.728
(distant howling)

1:12:03.519 --> 1:12:05.737
(rock music)

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:14.662
(denny): Come on.

1:12:35.301 --> 1:12:37.060
Hey.
- Uncle denny!

1:12:37.178 --> 1:12:38.168
- What's up, sport?

1:12:38.229 --> 1:12:39.078
How you been?

1:12:39.105 --> 1:12:40.671
- You should've me
at my last game,

1:12:40.732 --> 1:12:42.339
Knocked out two homers!

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:43.900
- Oh, I'm sorry I missed it.

1:12:44.018 --> 1:12:44.917
- You gotta come around more.

1:12:44.944 --> 1:12:48.446
- Yeah, I'll try, bud.
- Come on in.

1:12:50.909 --> 1:12:53.034
(rock music playing loudly)

1:12:56.272 --> 1:12:57.080
(music stops)

1:12:57.198 --> 1:12:57.855
- Well, shoot,

1:12:57.916 --> 1:12:59.189
If it ain't little brother.

1:12:59.250 --> 1:13:00.750
- Hey, jesse.

1:13:01.536 --> 1:13:03.419
- Hey, nash, why don't you
skedaddle for a little bit?

1:13:03.538 --> 1:13:05.346
Go play video games
in your room.

1:13:05.348 --> 1:13:07.014
- Yeah.

1:13:07.016 --> 1:13:08.349
- See you, bud.

1:13:08.351 --> 1:13:09.683
(sighing)

1:13:09.685 --> 1:13:12.804
- Well, you uh...
You look like crap.

1:13:13.956 --> 1:13:16.099
What's been going on with you?

1:13:17.293 --> 1:13:18.559
- Usual.
(chuckles)

1:13:19.962 --> 1:13:20.544
- Who's the lucky lady?

1:13:20.605 --> 1:13:23.881
- Oh, it's my friend, val.

1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:24.482
- Val.

1:13:26.202 --> 1:13:27.610
Aren't you a little old
to be with this one?

1:13:27.728 --> 1:13:30.538
- We're just friends.

1:13:30.540 --> 1:13:32.490
- You get a job yet, denny?

1:13:34.285 --> 1:13:36.786
Kidding, I know that's
never going to happen.

1:13:37.405 --> 1:13:39.029
Well, you're lucky you're here
when you are,

1:13:39.148 --> 1:13:41.715
Because carolee is still
at the grocer's,

1:13:41.717 --> 1:13:45.219
So whatever you want, why don't
you go and spit it out

1:13:45.221 --> 1:13:45.628
Before she gets back?

1:13:45.746 --> 1:13:48.297
What do you need?

1:13:48.416 --> 1:13:49.557
Did you get her pregnant?

1:13:49.559 --> 1:13:51.801
- I said it's not like that.

1:13:53.229 --> 1:13:55.304
- Yeah, I figured.

1:13:55.423 --> 1:13:57.682
I mean, look at him.

1:13:59.735 --> 1:14:04.238
- I need some help.
I need a car.

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:06.924
- Well, I've had it,
that's a new one.

1:14:06.985 --> 1:14:08.151
Oh, boy.

1:14:08.677 --> 1:14:11.595
- What in the hell
is he doing here?

1:14:11.614 --> 1:14:15.366
- Trying to jack my new car.
- Ha! That's rich.

1:14:15.485 --> 1:14:17.067
What's he want it for?

1:14:17.186 --> 1:14:19.162
Another trip
to the clam capital?

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:21.405
(laughing)
- that's really unnecessary.

1:14:21.524 --> 1:14:21.939
- Yeah? And who are you?

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.350
The next hussy?

1:14:24.836 --> 1:14:26.669
- I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

1:14:26.787 --> 1:14:30.506
You're kind of
my only family, um...

1:14:32.510 --> 1:14:34.010
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:14:38.524 --> 1:14:41.534
Yeah, I mean,
we're family, right?

1:14:41.969 --> 1:14:44.127
We're family?
(carolee): Yeah, we're family.

1:14:44.147 --> 1:14:47.356
- So... Alright.

1:14:47.475 --> 1:14:48.900
To family.

1:14:50.069 --> 1:14:51.736
Yeah.

1:14:52.697 --> 1:14:54.605
(carolee laughing)
here you go.

1:14:54.723 --> 1:14:56.607
Here you go, take it, take it.
Denny, take it.

1:14:56.725 --> 1:14:58.475
- Take 'em!

1:14:58.536 --> 1:14:59.810
- Oh!
(carolee laughing)

1:14:59.871 --> 1:15:02.279
No, I'm serious this time,
you can have time, really,

1:15:02.398 --> 1:15:03.389
Take them, take them.

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:05.041
Alright, that was it.
I promise I was just

1:15:05.159 --> 1:15:07.635
Playing around with you.
Take it, please.

1:15:07.637 --> 1:15:10.471
(laughing)

1:15:10.473 --> 1:15:11.639
You and me, we ain't family,

1:15:11.641 --> 1:15:13.566
And we ain't ever been a family.

1:15:13.593 --> 1:15:16.477
- Mm-hmm.
- That's why we grew up

1:15:16.479 --> 1:15:17.720
In the fosters.

1:15:19.415 --> 1:15:25.036
Yeah. Look, take this fiver,
and get out of here.

1:15:25.063 --> 1:15:27.872
(carolee laughing)
- that's more than you
deserve, denny.

1:15:27.899 --> 1:15:30.249
You're a sinkhole.

1:15:30.843 --> 1:15:33.343
You can't help
but get sucked down,

1:15:33.404 --> 1:15:36.781
And you pull anybody close
on down with you.

1:15:38.601 --> 1:15:40.201
You'll see.

1:15:40.795 --> 1:15:42.537
Just like when you got
kicked out of juvie,

1:15:42.655 --> 1:15:45.188
Or when you ran out of the army.

1:15:45.250 --> 1:15:48.084
You come in here
with your little peashooter

1:15:48.202 --> 1:15:51.194
And your tail between your legs
and you try to sink us too?

1:15:51.256 --> 1:15:52.755
Uh-uh.

1:15:53.374 --> 1:15:54.757
Now get out.

1:15:54.875 --> 1:15:55.833
Get out of my house

1:15:56.135 --> 1:15:57.851
Before I have jesse
whip your ass again!

1:15:57.853 --> 1:15:59.595
- You two ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

1:15:59.714 --> 1:16:00.854
- Girl you better watch
who you're--

1:16:00.856 --> 1:16:04.541
- You watch it!
This man, he is not perfect,

1:16:04.561 --> 1:16:08.120
I know that, and so do you,
but dragging him through the mud

1:16:08.147 --> 1:16:11.857
For your own amusement?
That's... That's just wrong.

1:16:12.018 --> 1:16:12.858
He's your family.

1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:16.153
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

1:16:23.571 --> 1:16:25.029
(sniffles)
- let's just go.

1:16:25.147 --> 1:16:27.531
There's no...
(val): Denny--

1:16:27.650 --> 1:16:29.333
- I have no family here.

1:16:30.995 --> 1:16:34.130
- See you later, little brother.

1:16:37.585 --> 1:16:39.176
(sniffling)

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:42.263
- Denny?

1:16:58.990 --> 1:17:01.198
Denny, you're not coming?

1:17:02.518 --> 1:17:04.084
- No.

1:17:04.086 --> 1:17:06.329
- Denny, don't do anything--

1:17:06.447 --> 1:17:09.874
- You and your uh...
Your husband, I...

1:17:13.028 --> 1:17:14.712
I hope it works out.

1:17:15.715 --> 1:17:18.049
- Denny.

1:17:19.886 --> 1:17:22.887
(sighing)
- you can go home now.

1:17:24.799 --> 1:17:27.308
Just go home.

1:17:33.641 --> 1:17:35.316
(breathing heavily)

1:17:36.885 --> 1:17:39.103
(phone ringing)
- answer the phone.

1:17:39.221 --> 1:17:40.045
- What?
- Answer the phone.

1:17:40.073 --> 1:17:42.698
- Okay, fine, I'll get it.
- Get it.

1:17:42.817 --> 1:17:45.910
(laughing)

1:17:46.629 --> 1:17:48.245
- Hey.

1:17:49.824 --> 1:17:52.433
- Where's the remote?
- I don't know.

1:17:52.551 --> 1:17:53.918
Hello?

1:17:55.237 --> 1:17:56.712
Oh damn, yeah, we've seen him.

1:17:56.831 --> 1:17:59.090
Why, what he'd do this time?

1:18:02.503 --> 1:18:03.569
No!

1:18:03.596 --> 1:18:04.161
- All I want is a ride.

1:18:04.222 --> 1:18:05.979
All I want is a ride.

1:18:05.981 --> 1:18:08.073
All I wanted was a ride!
That's all you had to do

1:18:08.101 --> 1:18:09.983
Was give me a ride!
- Easy, easy, easy.

1:18:09.985 --> 1:18:13.045
- You see me, you see me?
All I ever wanted was a ride.

1:18:13.047 --> 1:18:15.564
(carolee): No!
- Just a little bit of help,

1:18:15.683 --> 1:18:16.415
That's all I ever wanted.

1:18:16.442 --> 1:18:19.326
- Denny! Denny, no!
- Dad!

1:18:19.328 --> 1:18:20.602
- No!

1:18:20.721 --> 1:18:23.030
(breathing heavily)

1:18:23.149 --> 1:18:24.323
(crying)

1:18:24.483 --> 1:18:27.952
- Hey, come on, it's okay.
It's alright.

1:18:28.863 --> 1:18:31.288
- Denny...

1:18:32.992 --> 1:18:35.459
- Sorry, sport.

1:18:36.704 --> 1:18:38.129
- Let's go.

1:18:47.598 --> 1:18:49.807
(insects chirping)

1:18:56.056 --> 1:18:58.816
- You said you love your kids?

1:19:01.203 --> 1:19:03.821
Should've gone home to 'em.

1:19:09.069 --> 1:19:11.996
- I couldn't do that.

1:19:21.724 --> 1:19:23.207
- 10-4.
- What's going on?

1:19:23.325 --> 1:19:24.650
- We just got word denny
was seen

1:19:24.677 --> 1:19:26.543
Over at his brother's house.
It's not far from here.

1:19:26.662 --> 1:19:28.512
Come on, let's go.
- Alright, alright.

1:19:29.398 --> 1:19:31.348
(engine starting)

1:19:32.034 --> 1:19:34.676
(tires screeching)

1:19:34.795 --> 1:19:38.680
(sirens wailing)

1:19:38.799 --> 1:19:40.015
(breathing heavily)

1:19:40.133 --> 1:19:42.893
- Okay, okay, alright.
Just keep going.

1:19:43.011 --> 1:19:46.614
- Where do you want me to go?
- Get down toward the river.

1:19:46.732 --> 1:19:48.282

(siren wailing)

1:20:05.701 --> 1:20:07.301

1:20:20.933 --> 1:20:23.667

1:20:23.786 --> 1:20:25.377
Go straight. Not too fast.

1:20:25.404 --> 1:20:26.603

Turn right.

1:20:28.916 --> 1:20:31.500
Turn right, turn right.

(sirens wailing)

1:20:34.413 --> 1:20:36.263

They're everywhere.

1:20:59.638 --> 1:21:01.522
(heavy breathing)

1:21:02.308 --> 1:21:03.932
Denny...

1:21:04.143 --> 1:21:06.143
Denny...

1:21:06.145 --> 1:21:08.279
Look at me.

1:21:09.181 --> 1:21:11.757
You don't have to do this.

1:21:12.026 --> 1:21:13.041
You don't have to die here.

1:21:13.043 --> 1:21:16.220
<i> (officer): Denny tuohmy...</i>

1:21:16.222 --> 1:21:17.129

<i> - ...Or we will open fire.</i>
- Denny, think about this.

1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:23.526
Think about what you're doing.

1:21:23.646 --> 1:21:25.195
Denny, listen to me.
Look at me.

1:21:25.356 --> 1:21:26.830
Look at me, denny.

1:21:26.990 --> 1:21:27.497
(tires screeching)

1:21:27.616 --> 1:21:29.133
(overlapping chatter)

1:21:29.251 --> 1:21:31.059
- Denny tuohmy,
get out of the vehicle

1:21:31.061 --> 1:21:33.612
Or we will open fire!

1:21:33.639 --> 1:21:35.605
- No, no, no! Nobody fire!
Nobody shoot!

1:21:35.607 --> 1:21:36.590
That's my wife!

1:21:36.708 --> 1:21:38.541
- Denny. Denny.

1:21:38.603 --> 1:21:41.544
Think about the people
who care about you.

1:21:41.606 --> 1:21:42.621
Hmm?

1:21:42.648 --> 1:21:43.046
(crying)

1:21:43.107 --> 1:21:45.357
(sniffling)

1:21:46.385 --> 1:21:49.111
- Nobody cares about me.
- That's not true.

1:21:49.229 --> 1:21:52.865
That boy, nash,
he cares about you.

1:21:53.384 --> 1:21:55.075
Listen, I don't know
if you're going to get

1:21:55.194 --> 1:21:59.880
The love you want from cherie,
but I do know that if you...

1:21:59.882 --> 1:22:01.790
If you want a chance at that,

1:22:01.909 --> 1:22:04.435
You have to start being the man
that she wants you to be.

1:22:04.595 --> 1:22:08.372
The man you want to be, hmm?

1:22:08.532 --> 1:22:10.633
The man who took her
to california

1:22:10.751 --> 1:22:13.101
To see the flash of green
in the pacific

1:22:13.220 --> 1:22:15.095
And the sand between your toes.

1:22:15.097 --> 1:22:18.298
(officers shouting)

1:22:18.417 --> 1:22:19.600
Okay?

1:22:20.961 --> 1:22:22.377
(panting)

1:22:22.396 --> 1:22:24.905
- Uh, uh...
- Okay...

1:22:24.907 --> 1:22:26.623
(sobbing)
- okay.

1:22:26.625 --> 1:22:29.151
- It's okay.

1:22:32.156 --> 1:22:34.723
That's it.
- Throw out your weapon! Now!

1:22:34.842 --> 1:22:36.633
- Don't shoot him!

1:22:37.069 --> 1:22:39.602
- Move! Go, go, go, go!

1:22:39.764 --> 1:22:42.005
- Denny, slowly reach out
with your right hand

1:22:42.007 --> 1:22:42.206
And open the door.

1:22:43.909 --> 1:22:46.176
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1:22:46.178 --> 1:22:48.203
He's getting out!
He's getting out!

1:22:48.321 --> 1:22:50.764
- Open the door
and get out slowly!

1:22:50.766 --> 1:22:51.674
Look away from me!

1:22:51.792 --> 1:22:53.734
- Get out of the car!
Put your hands up!

1:22:53.852 --> 1:22:55.711
(overlapping shouting)
- down on your knees!

1:22:55.829 --> 1:22:56.971
- Stay on the ground!
- Belly down!

1:22:57.089 --> 1:22:58.088
- Hands behind your back.
Don't move!

1:22:58.248 --> 1:23:00.173
- Are you alright?
- On the ground!

1:23:00.292 --> 1:23:02.242
- Denny, you have the right
to remain silent.

1:23:02.244 --> 1:23:04.161
Anything you say can and will

1:23:04.163 --> 1:23:05.779
Be used against you
in a court of law.

1:23:05.781 --> 1:23:07.313
(voice echoing): You have
the right to consult

1:23:07.315 --> 1:23:08.983
With a lawyer before questioning
and have a lawyer present

1:23:09.101 --> 1:23:10.784
During questioning if you wish.

1:23:10.786 --> 1:23:12.503
If you cannot afford
a lawyer, you will be

1:23:12.505 --> 1:23:14.697
Appointed one free of charge...

1:23:14.815 --> 1:23:17.091
(voices echoing)

1:23:17.209 --> 1:23:19.443
- We got him. Alright,
everybody, we got him.

1:23:19.445 --> 1:23:20.494
- Hey!
- Mark!

1:23:20.612 --> 1:23:21.870
- Hey.

1:23:21.872 --> 1:23:23.438
Oh!

1:23:23.457 --> 1:23:25.207
Oh. You're okay!
You're okay!

1:23:25.325 --> 1:23:28.652
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:23:28.654 --> 1:23:30.087
(panting)

1:23:33.158 --> 1:23:35.384

Why?
