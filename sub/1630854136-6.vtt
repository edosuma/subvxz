- Yes, thank you.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.527
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:49.527 --> 00:53.227
<i>the fabulous fall collection
from Perry Sutton.</i>

00:56.143 --> 00:58.232
Hello, everyone.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.365
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

01:01.365 --> 01:05.804
I just wanted to say
that I am so incredibly proud

01:05.804 --> 01:07.632
of our new flagship boutique.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.026
Huh?

01:10.026 --> 01:13.638
I truly hope that this store
will encourage other designers

01:13.638 --> 01:17.642
to invest in this community in
spite of the recent crime wave.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.080
You know, as someone who was
born and raised in this city,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.995
it's heartbreaking to me to see
what's happening all around--

01:22.995 --> 01:27.174
all the anger,
all the violence.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.959
But I believe in New York.

01:29.959 --> 01:33.832
And more importantly,
I believe in New Yorkers.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.793
We don't give up.

01:37.793 --> 01:41.971
And we sure as hell
don't let punks push us around.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.235
The DOA, Perry Sutton,
took two to the chest.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.063
- The fashion designer?
- Yeah.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.412
From what I'm told,
he's a big deal.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.153
Never heard of him.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.242
- Robbery?
- Doesn't look that way.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.592
Phone and wallet were
still in his possession.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.507
- Casings?
- No, nothing.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.770
Perp either policed his brass
or used a revolver.

01:58.770 --> 01:59.945
Witnesses?

01:59.945 --> 02:01.251
One.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.259
Oh.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.567
I guess that makes you
the fashion police.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.880
No, not much to work with
at the moment, lieu.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.664
Got one witness.
Heard more than he saw.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.623
Yeah, he was walking down
East 10th Street, 11:00 p.m.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.320
Saw two men from a distance.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.800
He didn't know
how old they were,

03:11.800 --> 03:13.410
what they were wearing,
or even what they look like.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.151
But he heard one of them
yell, "Give it back!"

03:15.151 --> 03:16.370
And then,
he heard gunshots.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.849
Two or three.
He wasn't sure.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.678
So did you recover
any surveillance video yet?

03:20.678 --> 03:23.246
No, nothing in the immediate
vicinity of the crime scene.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.640
Jalen's right.
Nothing near the actual scene.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.468
But I found a video
of Perry Sutton

03:27.468 --> 03:29.687
near the corner
of Avenue C and 7th Street

03:29.687 --> 03:31.994
approximately seven minutes
before the 911 call.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.822
Well, that gives us
some place to start.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.650
Question is,
where was he coming from?

03:35.650 --> 03:38.479
I'm guessing his new boutique
on East 5th Street.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.785
He threw a big soirée
last night.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.265
"A grand opening."

03:42.265 --> 03:43.745
Let's check it out.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.486
Mm.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.925
I can't believe he's gone.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.057
It just doesn't feel real.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.059
I've been working for Perry
since college.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.452
He was a great boss.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.019
I'm sorry for your loss,

03:57.019 --> 03:59.282
but we do have some questions
for you if you don't mind.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.631
There was a party here
last night, right?

04:00.631 --> 04:02.894
Yeah,
it was the grand opening.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.810
Sutton spent two years
building this place.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.943
Did anything unusual happen
at the party?

04:07.943 --> 04:12.077
Were there any arguments, altercations?

04:12.077 --> 04:16.212
Perry and a woman got into
an argument around 10:30 or so.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.779
- About what?
- I don't know.

04:17.779 --> 04:21.261
She just sort of showed up,
started yelling at Perry.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.394
I tried to break it up, but he
left before I could get there.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.918
- He left his own party?
- Party was winding down.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.399
And what about this woman
he was arguing with?

04:29.399 --> 04:32.228
Followed him out the door.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.491
I feel like he's the reason
my business failed--

04:34.491 --> 04:37.015
all the construction,
the noise, the dust.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.843
It's hard enough to keep
a small business going

04:38.843 --> 04:40.584
these days, especially
in this neighborhood.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.586
People just steal stuff,
and we're supposed

04:42.586 --> 04:43.979
to just stand there
and do nothing,

04:43.979 --> 04:46.982
pretend they're actually
not committing a crime.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.940
That must have been
really frustrating.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.422
Yeah, it's a joke, and you
people just sit back and watch.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.989
Uh, no,
we make the arrests.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.165
And then, the judges,
politicians, and DAs,

04:56.165 --> 04:58.472
they don't want
to incarcerate anyone anymore.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.082
So let me get this straight.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.127
You just decided to give Perry
Sutton a piece of your mind.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.565
Is that right?
- Yeah, I--

05:04.565 --> 05:07.350
I told him he had no regard
for local shop owners.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.396
He just looked at me.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.963
Sort of apologized.
- What'd you do?

05:11.963 --> 05:14.575
I told him he needed
to compensate me.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.751
- And?
- He agreed with me.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.144
And he offered me a job
at his new store.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.320
100 grand a year.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.930
- And then what?
- Then we came back here.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.584
I showed him around,
made him a cup of tea,

05:23.584 --> 05:25.455
and we started talking.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.978
And what did you two
talk about?

05:26.978 --> 05:28.589
He spent most of the time
talking about

05:28.589 --> 05:31.069
his ex-girlfriend,
some model.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.507
Said they had a bad breakup.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.726
- Was he upset about that?
- Very.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.860
She was calling him, saying
all kinds of crazy stuff.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.644
Like what?

05:40.644 --> 05:43.691
Like she wanted to kill him.

05:43.691 --> 05:44.692
Hmm.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.008
Looks like a model to me.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.668
Excuse me, Sofia.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.018
If you don't mind,
we have a few questions for--

06:07.018 --> 06:08.411
No, no. Don't do that.
- Hey, hey!

06:08.411 --> 06:09.499
Don't do that.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.675
We're police.
Do not raise that gun.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.895
You see that shiny, gold thing?
It's a badge.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.636
You keep that gun down,
or we will shoot you.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.028
- Keep that gun where it is.
- OK.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.030
- Keep it where it is.
- Yes, okay.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.208
What the hell are you doing?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.471
We're going for a ride.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.863
For what?

06:25.863 --> 06:29.389
For starters,
pulling a gun on a cop.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.042
Not just a gun,
a revolver.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.088
Same kind of weapon used
to kill your ex-boyfriend,

06:33.088 --> 06:34.089
Perry Sutton.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.704
<i>I brought the gun last year</i>

06:40.704 --> 06:43.359
<i>after some fan
started stalking me.</i>

06:43.359 --> 06:45.579
He showed up to my yoga class
last week,

06:45.579 --> 06:48.364
and you guys refused
to do anything about it.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.845
So I carry a gun,
but it's registered.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.238
I have a carry permit, too,
so it's all totally legit.

06:53.238 --> 06:56.720
That doesn't mean you get
to flash it whenever you want.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.462
You're lucky to be alive
right now.

06:59.462 --> 07:03.031
I've been on edge lately.

07:03.031 --> 07:06.730
This stalker thing is hard.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.124
Anything else
bothering you lately?

07:09.124 --> 07:10.168
Like what?

07:10.168 --> 07:12.780
Like Perry Sutton.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.434
No.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.087
I never would have hurt him.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.263
Where were you last night,
around 11:00?

07:18.263 --> 07:21.266
In my apartment, crying.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.312
Because of the breakup?

07:23.312 --> 07:27.490
Yeah, I was devastated.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.449
He was a really good guy.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.842
So you weren't angry
with him?

07:31.842 --> 07:34.192
No.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.977
Truth is,
he's a hard guy to hate.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.458
He's so upbeat and generous.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.983
In fact, he just hired me to be
the face of his new campaign.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.899
Biggest contract of my life.
500 grand.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.117
And when was this?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.771
Three days ago.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.992
The day before
he broke it off with you?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.733
<i>It's a hell
of a going-away present.</i>

07:59.043 --> 08:01.132
I just got off the phone
with Sofia's doorman.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.439
He confirmed
that she was in her apartment

08:03.439 --> 08:07.312
from 5:26 p.m.
to 8:32 a.m. the next day.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.053
- She's not our shooter.
- No.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.577
And ballistics came back, too.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.317
Her gun is not
the murder weapon,

08:12.317 --> 08:14.885
so let's go easy on her, Frank.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.017
She you pulled a gun on us, lieu.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.801
I get it,
but she's a single woman.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.063
She's got somebody
stalking her,

08:19.063 --> 08:20.500
so I think
we should give her a break.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.200
Sofia gave Sutton a watch
for his birthday,

08:25.200 --> 08:26.331
an expensive one.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.419
Said he always had it on.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.030
So?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.640
So it was not on his wrist

08:30.640 --> 08:34.122
when we found him
at the crime scene.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.515
These two photos were taken

08:35.515 --> 08:37.952
at the grand opening event
at 10:26 p.m.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.519
He's definitely
wearing the watch.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.998
But
in the crime scene photos...

08:40.998 --> 08:43.784
Can you zoom in?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.263
40 minutes later,
no watch.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.745
So maybe it really was
just a regular armed robbery.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.487
You know, the killer sees
this fancy piece of jewelry.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.749
He pulls out a gun.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.403
He tells the victim
to hand it over.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.927
The victim resists,
winds up dead.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.364
And it's such a good score,
the shooter doesn't even bother

08:59.364 --> 09:01.149
to grab Sutton's wallet
or phone?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.759
Right.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.240
The watch Sutton was wearing
has a GPS chip inside of it.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.589
Means we can track it.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.210
NYPD! Open up!

09:37.228 --> 09:38.665
NYPD! Open up!

09:38.665 --> 09:40.536
Breach!

09:44.627 --> 09:46.586
Hey, hey, hey!
Police!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.631
Stop!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:48.631 --> 09:50.502
Nowhere to go, bro.
Put your hands up.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.548
Put your hands up
nice and slow!

09:52.548 --> 09:53.984
Open them up.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.122
The hell are you doing here?
- I work here.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.297
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:02.297 --> 10:04.038
Investigating a homicide.

10:04.038 --> 10:08.259
Gum, paper towels,
detergent, toothpaste.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.918
What the hell?

10:16.180 --> 10:18.748
All this stuff yours?
- Yeah, it's mine.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.973
You hear that?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.765
Then you got
a lot of explaining to do.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.118
I don't know nothing
about no watch.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.946
But we found it
in your warehouse.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.992
I got lots of stuff
in that warehouse.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.689
Can't pay attention
to every single item.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.690
Come on, Eddie.
We're talking about

10:47.690 --> 10:49.126
a really expensive watch,

10:49.126 --> 10:51.041
not a couple of tubes
of toothpaste over here.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.956
I buy in bulk.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.829
I'm a legitimate businessman.
- A legitimate businessman?

10:55.829 --> 10:57.004
So you're trying to tell me
you have receipts

10:57.004 --> 10:58.658
for all those items
in your warehouse?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.965
Like I keep saying,
I buy in bulk.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.272
The people in the neighborhood
know that,

11:04.272 --> 11:05.752
so they bring me inventory.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.536
Who brought you this watch?

11:07.536 --> 11:09.277
Don't know,
like I said.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.627
If you say "I buy in bulk"
one more time,

11:11.627 --> 11:13.368
I swear to God...
- Fine, I won't say it.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.413
But I still don't know anything
about that watch.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.588
How about a murder?

11:16.588 --> 11:17.502
Do you know anything
about that?

11:17.502 --> 11:18.808
Hell no.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.158
Where were you last night
around 11:00?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.813
In Queens,
watching TV with my wife.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.162
You could check it out
for yourself.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
But that's it.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.037
I'm done talking. Lawyer.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.648
Why on Earth would Eddie
agree to cooperate?

11:32.648 --> 11:35.782
Because he leases a warehouse
filled with stolen goods...

11:35.782 --> 11:38.045
That he sells out
of a discount store in Queens.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.612
Yeah, but if he tells us
where he got the watch,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.092
we'll reduce
the criminal charges.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.441
What criminal charges?

11:43.441 --> 11:46.009
Possession of stolen
property, among others.

11:46.009 --> 11:48.708
Chile, please.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.884
One, I'm not a child.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
Two, Eddie's staring down
real time.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.279
For buying stolen toothpaste?

11:55.279 --> 11:58.718
Criminal possession of stolen
property in the second degree.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.328
Maximum sentence: 15 years.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.286
You can rattle those sabers
all you want,

12:02.286 --> 12:03.548
but it ain't gonna happen.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.855
Now, kindly let the man go.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.901
Yeah, that ain't
gonna happen either.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.119
See, that right there
is the attitude

12:09.119 --> 12:10.642
that the people are
rebelling against--

12:10.642 --> 12:12.644
white cops
punishing Black men...

12:12.644 --> 12:13.733
- Okay, okay.
- For nothing.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.778
Get the hell out
of my precinct,

12:15.778 --> 12:17.649
or I'll arrest your ass, too.

12:23.481 --> 12:27.964
Yee, any luck with the video
near the warehouse?

12:27.964 --> 12:30.532
Found some footage
a block away.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.709
All these guys bringing in
stolen goods and making money.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.190
And another.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.627
Confirms our theory
that Eddie is an active buyer

12:38.627 --> 12:41.412
of stolen merchandise.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.806
Yeah, of low-end merchandise.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.896
Bubblegum, shaving cream,
mouthwash, not Rolexes,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.332
which begs the question:

12:48.332 --> 12:51.248
how did Sutton's watch
get into the warehouse?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.424
Well, we know
Eddie didn't steal it.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.817
His alibi is clean.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.514
Cell phone tracking
has him at home in Queens.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.081
Well, then, the only thing
that makes any sense

12:58.081 --> 13:00.649
is one of Eddie's "associates"
stole it.

13:00.649 --> 13:01.998
- That sounds about right.
- So, Frank,

13:01.998 --> 13:04.174
you found the watch
in a large, red duffel bag

13:04.174 --> 13:05.610
with a bunch
of other stolen items.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.829
What are you saying?

13:06.829 --> 13:08.918
That the killer
stole Sutton's watch

13:08.918 --> 13:10.790
before he stole
all that other stuff?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.095
Or after.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.923
Check the tags
on that stolen merchandise

13:13.923 --> 13:15.751
in the duffel bags.
And let's go set up

13:15.751 --> 13:18.014
on the warehouse
and find another associate.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.547
I got a potential suspect

13:29.547 --> 13:31.201
carrying
two large shopping bags

13:31.201 --> 13:33.813
heading
for the main entrance now.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.949
How you doing?

13:39.949 --> 13:44.040
I got a couple questions
for you.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.781
Damn!

13:59.142 --> 14:00.491
- No--hey! Okay!
- Come on!

14:00.491 --> 14:02.319
- Okay!
- There you go!

14:02.319 --> 14:03.755
Okay, okay!

14:03.755 --> 14:05.714
- Have a seat, buddy!
- Okay!

14:11.459 --> 14:13.243
Whew!
Nice haul, buddy.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.376
You got soap,
toothpaste, chocolate.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.813
You ever steal
any shaving cream or batteries?

14:17.813 --> 14:20.207
I don't know, probably.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.556
Recently?

14:21.556 --> 14:23.819
No, this was my
first delivery in a few weeks.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.255
I was out of town for a while.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.737
Visiting my mother
on Rhode Island.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.478
Oh, I bet
she's real proud of you.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.653
That's out of line.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.915
Why's that?

14:32.915 --> 14:34.612
'Cause I ain't
doing anything illegal.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.049
Oh, I hate
to break it to you, pal,

14:36.049 --> 14:38.225
but stealing,
it's still illegal.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.923
Even though there is no bail
doesn't mean it's not a crime.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.316
I don't know about all that,

14:42.316 --> 14:45.319
but I do know I can walk
into any store I want,

14:45.319 --> 14:47.625
fill my bags up
with whatever I want,

14:47.625 --> 14:49.932
and every employee
in the damn place

14:49.932 --> 14:52.239
will just look the other way.

14:52.239 --> 14:55.938
Last month, the manager
opened the door for me

14:55.938 --> 14:57.157
'cause my hands was too full

14:57.157 --> 14:58.419
from all the stuff
I was taking.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.421
It's a true story.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.511
You ever steal a watch?

15:03.511 --> 15:04.860
They lock those up.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.253
No, I mean from a person.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.995
You ever steal a watch
from a human being?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.910
I don't steal from people.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.608
How about your friends?
Do they steal from people?

15:13.608 --> 15:15.871
Who then sell it
to Eddie Wells here?

15:15.871 --> 15:18.265
No,
not that I know about anyway.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.484
Anybody you know
ever use a red duffel bag

15:20.484 --> 15:21.616
to put their stuff in?

15:21.616 --> 15:24.227
No.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
Can I go?
- No.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.144
We're arresting you
for larceny

15:28.144 --> 15:30.799
and unlawful fleeing
from a police officer.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.715
But don't worry, you'll
be out on bail real soon.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.288
That guy, Gwynn, literally
thinks stealing is legal now.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.943
Was surprised
we actually arrested him.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.467
Yeah, I mean, criminals
pay attention to society.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.251
They act accordingly, they
adjust their business plans.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.992
Yeah, and right now,
it's a good time to be a thief,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.472
which is a problem,
because people aren't

15:51.472 --> 15:52.647
gonna stand for that forever.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.865
They're gonna fight back,
and that's--

15:53.865 --> 15:55.215
that's a real problem for us.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.391
- I mean, I suppose so, but...
- Don't tell me

15:57.391 --> 15:58.783
it's more complicated.
- It's more complicated.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.089
Yeah, I think
I've heard that before.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.830
'Cause it is!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.874
All right.
One more block up.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.180
That's the pharmacy.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.355
Now, Yee is sure

16:05.355 --> 16:06.661
that the stuff
from the red duffel bag

16:06.661 --> 16:07.662
was taken from this place?

16:07.662 --> 16:08.793
Everything but the watch.

16:08.793 --> 16:09.969
She scanned
all the stolen items,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.492
traced it back
to King's Pharmacy,

16:11.492 --> 16:13.102
right up here.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.324
I'm gonna need more details
than that, fellas.

16:17.324 --> 16:20.675
I got people stealing things
all day, every day.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.937
Two nights ago.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.287
00 p.m.,
give or take an hour.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.334
Oh, that dude.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.639
He was hardcore, man.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.991
Putting all these items
in a big duffel bag.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.688
A red duffel bag?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.472
Yeah, bright red.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.257
So listen, I walk up
to the guy and say,

16:37.257 --> 16:39.172
"Look, you got to pay
for these items."

16:39.172 --> 16:42.175
He laughs at me,
tells me to kiss his ass,

16:42.175 --> 16:43.828
and keeps stealing
right in front of me.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.179
So I get angry
and I grab him by the arm.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.876
And he hits me,
the side of the head.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.356
Kind of knocks me off balance.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.445
Then a bunch of customers
start yelling.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.708
This one guy runs up,
and he starts to help, too.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.014
Gets right in the dude's face.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.450
Then,
he pushes the guy off of him

16:56.450 --> 16:58.147
and runs right out
of the store.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.672
- These cameras work?
- Yeah.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.979
- We got to see the video.
- That's not a problem.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.981
Look, you guys got
to arrest these punks.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.069
We're losing money here,

17:07.069 --> 17:08.418
and it's not just
the stolen goods.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.203
Customers are scared
to come here.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.901
People are scared
to go shopping.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.340
<i>What are you doing, man?
You got to pay for this.</i>

17:17.340 --> 17:18.515
<i>- Back up!</i>
- That looks like

17:18.515 --> 17:20.256
the same red bag
where we found the watch.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.866
<i>Get off of me!
Don't touch me!</i>

17:21.866 --> 17:23.477
Damn, that is
a legit right cross.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.436
All right, hold up.
Freeze it right there.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.048
Well, look at that.
Our good Samaritan.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.398
That's Perry Sutton.
- Good man.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.009
<i>- Get off me, man!
- Hey, you all right?</i>

17:34.009 --> 17:35.358
Then he goes after him.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.968
All right.
What about our shoplifter?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.622
Can you get a better angle
on him?

17:38.622 --> 17:39.797
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right there.

17:39.797 --> 17:40.972
Right there.
That's good.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.714
Running facial rec now.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.760
Got a hit.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.109
Name is Nick Castillo.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.155
Does he have any priors?

17:49.155 --> 17:52.201
Uh, yeah, I think
this dude just broke a record.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.464
I have never seen anything
like this.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.596
You got to be kidding me.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.641
15 pages, literally.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.774
All right, let's get
his last known address

17:59.774 --> 18:01.080
and get a search warrant.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.433
NYPD!

18:06.433 --> 18:07.521
Open up!

18:10.437 --> 18:12.265
NYPD! Anybody home?

18:12.265 --> 18:15.050
What's going on?

18:15.050 --> 18:16.965
- Nick Castillo live here?
- Yeah. Why?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.358
- Is he home?
- No.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.882
What's this?
- This is a search warrant.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.318
NYPD!

18:26.017 --> 18:27.541
All clear.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.847
- What's going on?
- Nothing to worry about.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.632
We're just having
a look around.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.808
What are you looking for?

18:33.808 --> 18:35.244
I got nothing in here.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.811
Yeah,
just some half-smoked joints

18:36.811 --> 18:39.944
and beer bottles over here.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.555
Where's Nick?
We need to talk to him.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.079
Okay,
but he's not doing too well.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.515
What do you mean?

18:45.515 --> 18:47.430
He's in the hospital.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.431
How come?

18:48.431 --> 18:50.172
He got shot.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.538
What's going on?

19:08.538 --> 19:10.801
Nick Castillo,
you're under arrest

19:10.801 --> 19:12.455
for the murder
of Perry Sutton.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.935
I'm in the hospital.

19:13.935 --> 19:17.068
I got an infection.
You can't arrest me.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.896
Yeah, we can.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.465
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.598
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

19:24.598 --> 19:25.599
in a court of law.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.216
Mr. Castillo,
are you able

19:34.216 --> 19:37.437
to understand the nature
of these proceedings?

19:37.437 --> 19:40.222
My client pleads not guilty

19:40.222 --> 19:42.224
to the charge of murder
in the second degree.

19:42.224 --> 19:45.923
We ask that he remain in the
hospital to receive treatment

19:45.923 --> 19:48.404
and then be allowed
to return home to recover.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.710
Ms. Maroun?

19:49.710 --> 19:51.451
He can convalesce in Rikers.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.713
People seek remand.

19:52.713 --> 19:55.063
The people's case
is built on sand.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.892
No eyewitnesses,
no forensics, no gun,

19:57.892 --> 20:00.068
no stolen property--
nothing.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.070
The bullet taken out
of Mr. Castillo's leg

20:02.070 --> 20:03.332
puts him
at the scene of the crime.

20:03.332 --> 20:07.206
The defendant is
a career criminal.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.903
107 arrests.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.252
Started at age 16,

20:10.252 --> 20:12.907
swiping packages
off his neighbor's stoop.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.561
Graduated to shoplifting,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.563
then larceny
and receiving stolen property.

20:16.563 --> 20:17.694
The list goes on.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.261
All misdemeanors.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.915
Most ended up
getting dismissed.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.309
My client has
no felony convictions

20:23.309 --> 20:25.224
and has never done time.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.878
He failed to appear in court
63 times.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.402
Clearly, he's a flight risk.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.882
I'm adopting
the prosecutor's recommendation

20:31.882 --> 20:33.710
and holding you without bail.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.281
Ms. Maroun.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.630
What's this?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.719
Pre-trial motion.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.553
The people have no case.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.991
Their plan is, obviously,
to prejudice the jury

20:53.991 --> 20:57.430
with evidence of my client's
past transgressions,

20:57.430 --> 20:58.996
convict him of murder

20:58.996 --> 21:02.391
over a series
of trivial misdemeanors.

21:02.391 --> 21:05.612
107 arrests
is more than a series.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.962
This guy should get
the lifetime achievement award.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.398
You just made my point.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.357
The jury has a right
to know who the defendant is,

21:11.357 --> 21:14.621
that he is quite literally
a career criminal.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.187
Demonstrates a pattern

21:16.187 --> 21:19.147
of increasingly aggressive
and criminal conduct.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.889
This is revolting,

21:21.889 --> 21:23.456
but I find the probative value

21:23.456 --> 21:25.806
of Mr. Castillo's
prior criminal actions

21:25.806 --> 21:27.416
to be outweighed

21:27.416 --> 21:29.766
by the prejudicial effect
it'll have on the jury.

21:29.766 --> 21:32.943
So I'm granting the defendant's
application to exclude.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.861
No mention of his record
in your opening statement.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.302
Want me to draft an appeal?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.955
Judge didn't abuse
his discretion.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.870
And our case is still solid.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.481
Well,
I'm not so sure about that.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.352
No eyewitnesses,
no video

21:50.352 --> 21:52.049
that can explain
how the crime was committed,

21:52.049 --> 21:53.355
and no murder weapon.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.879
And now, we can't even
let the jury know

21:55.879 --> 21:58.708
that Castillo is
a career criminal.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.188
Maybe we should offer a deal

22:00.188 --> 22:02.146
to the discount store guy,
Eddie Wells?

22:02.146 --> 22:03.409
We have what we have, Sam.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.932
We just need
to lay out the evidence

22:04.932 --> 22:07.282
in a simple, logical way.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.719
The pharmacy manager, the
pharmacy surveillance video,

22:09.719 --> 22:11.808
the witness who heard the
two men arguing in the street,

22:11.808 --> 22:13.375
ballistics.

22:13.375 --> 22:17.161
The case isn't perfect,
but it's clear.

22:17.161 --> 22:20.121
Nick Castillo
killed Perry Sutton.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.651
The defendant went
into the pharmacy

22:28.651 --> 22:32.133
and emptied a shelf
of toothpaste and mouthwash

22:32.133 --> 22:34.396
into a duffel bag.

22:34.396 --> 22:38.531
When confronted,
he struck the store manager.

22:38.531 --> 22:41.708
A concerned citizen,
Perry Sutton,

22:41.708 --> 22:46.365
witnessed the theft and assault
and decided to get involved.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.628
He followed the defendant out
of the store.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.631
Once outside,
Mr. Sutton told the defendant

22:51.631 --> 22:53.937
to return what he stole.

22:53.937 --> 22:57.114
A witness heard him yell,
"Give it back!"

22:57.114 --> 22:59.682
The defendant responded
by pulling out a gun.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.684
Objection.

23:01.684 --> 23:05.253
It's hearsay, and he's
mischaracterizing the facts.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.951
An objection to my opening?

23:07.951 --> 23:09.344
What the hell is going on?

23:09.344 --> 23:10.824
Ms. Vega,
hold your objections

23:10.824 --> 23:12.129
until the people have finished.

23:16.482 --> 23:20.137
Um, Mr. Sutton tried
to protect himself,

23:20.137 --> 23:22.052
grabbed the gun.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.445
A struggle ensued,

23:23.445 --> 23:26.840
during which the defendant
was shot in the leg.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.190
He then regained control
of the gun

23:29.190 --> 23:31.453
and shot and killed
Perry Sutton.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.454
Objection.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.283
Move for a mistrial.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.459
I told you
to save your objections

23:37.459 --> 23:39.330
until Mr. Price was finished.

23:39.330 --> 23:42.333
I have to protect my client,
Your Honor.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.424
The people's theory is
based on pure fiction.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.601
And by spinning this tale
based on pure speculation

23:48.601 --> 23:50.385
and racial innuendo,

23:50.385 --> 23:53.344
Mr. Price is doing
irreparable harm to our case.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.564
I am simply
telling the jury

23:55.564 --> 23:57.610
what we will prove
during trial.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.047
Perry Sutton was the one
carrying a gun,

24:00.047 --> 24:01.440
not Mr. Castillo.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.791
He attacked Mr. Castillo,
not the other way around.

24:04.791 --> 24:08.447
That is for the jury
to decide based on the facts.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.972
I agree.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.582
Your objection is overruled,

24:13.582 --> 24:16.498
and your motion for a mistrial
is denied.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.544
And if you interrupt
Mr. Price's opening

24:18.544 --> 24:21.111
one more time,
I will hold you in contempt.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.591
Understood?

24:33.559 --> 24:36.083
I have never experienced
anything like that

24:36.083 --> 24:37.214
in my entire career.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.520
Is there anything

24:38.520 --> 24:41.001
to what the defense lawyer
was saying?

24:41.001 --> 24:43.133
Did Perry Sutton own a gun?
- No.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.787
He's never applied
for a firearms license.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.921
And everyone we've spoken to--
people who know him well--

24:47.921 --> 24:50.314
say that they've never seen him
with a weapon of any kind.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.534
And on top of all of that,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.667
he's donated hundreds
of thousands of dollars

24:54.667 --> 24:57.234
to local charities
that support gun control.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.714
Well, it doesn't mean
he didn't have a gun

24:58.714 --> 25:00.237
the night he was killed.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.239
We represent the people,
Ms. Maroun.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.198
All I'm saying is,
we weren't there.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.592
We don't know
what really happened.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.464
Same as most murder cases
we try.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.641
So we piece together the story
based on the facts we do know.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.470
And in this case,
the facts lead us

25:15.470 --> 25:18.473
to one, and only one,
logical conclusion:

25:18.473 --> 25:21.563
Nick Castillo was the person
carrying a gun that night.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.912
I agree.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.566
But will the jury
see it that way?

25:24.566 --> 25:28.222
I think so, and they're
gonna like Perry Sutton.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.051
Despite his wealth and fame,
he's relatable.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.487
He was a real New Yorker.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.229
He loved this city.
He invested in this city.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.447
And like most of us,

25:36.447 --> 25:38.058
he was sick and tired
of all the crime,

25:38.058 --> 25:39.494
so he did something about it.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.845
As long as we don't paint him
as a vigilante.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.718
That'll just feed
into the defense's assertion

25:45.718 --> 25:47.589
that Sutton
was carrying the gun.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.026
But like I said,
we still don't know.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.550
It's our word against theirs.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.986
There's nothing
we can do about that, Sam.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.249
- We could offer a plea.
- No.

25:55.249 --> 25:58.600
Castillo needs to go down.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.517
Even though the jury won't know
Castillo was a career criminal,

26:02.517 --> 26:04.867
the people of this city do.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.652
So we need to send a message,

26:06.652 --> 26:08.871
let people know
we won't stand

26:08.871 --> 26:12.179
for this level of recidivism
and violence.

26:14.181 --> 26:17.010
Dig
through Castillo's past cases.

26:17.010 --> 26:20.579
Find someone who can testify
to a history of violence.

26:25.192 --> 26:29.065
107 arrests, 0 consequences.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.589
Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.721
We're frustrated, too.
Trust me.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.027
But let's face it.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.638
It not like this just happened
for no reason.

26:36.638 --> 26:37.987
I agree.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.641
It wasn't too long ago
we were locking up people

26:39.641 --> 26:41.121
for not being able
to scrape together

26:41.121 --> 26:43.079
100 bucks' worth of bail.

26:43.079 --> 26:46.561
They were sitting in Rikers
for months--some, years--

26:46.561 --> 26:48.824
while their dumbass
misdemeanor cases

26:48.824 --> 26:50.957
would just drag on and on.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.915
That may be true,
but I'm not sure the cure

26:52.915 --> 26:54.308
is any better than the disease.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.092
I hear you, Frank.
We overcorrected.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.920
And it's
driving people crazy.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.140
They're starting to take
matters into their own hands.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.228
Like Perry Sutton.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.100
Mm-hmm.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.624
Maroun.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.147
Yeah?

27:07.147 --> 27:09.497
Your name's on this jacket.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.846
- What?
- Yeah.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.413
It looks like
you arraigned Castillo

27:12.413 --> 27:14.676
ten months ago for theft.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.156
He's been released
on his own recognizance,

27:16.156 --> 27:18.680
and the case is still pending.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.855
This is my case?

27:22.858 --> 27:25.861
Yeah, larceny.

27:25.861 --> 27:26.993
Victim was from Africa

27:26.993 --> 27:28.647
and had a hard time
speaking English.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.301
Castillo didn't qualify for
bail under the new bail laws.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.520
Nothing I could do.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.872
Come on, Sam.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.266
Guy has a 15-page rap sheet?

27:39.266 --> 27:41.050
Had to be something
you could have done.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.878
I mean,
you had a witness.

27:54.585 --> 27:57.110
Hello, Jasmine.
ADA Maroun.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.851
We met before.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.114
You never call me back.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.593
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry.

28:02.593 --> 28:06.032
I remember that we were
trying to find a translator.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.207
And then, I...

28:07.207 --> 28:09.296
I apologize for the confusion.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.733
I'm ADA Price.
Nice to meet you, Jasmine.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.561
We have a translator
coming today.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.129
He should be here
in ten minutes or so.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.391
Do you want us to wait?

28:17.391 --> 28:19.088
No, that's okay.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.090
My--my English is better now.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.526
Okay.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.398
I will text him.
Let him know.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.096
Yeah, I just have
a few questions.

28:27.096 --> 28:32.275
First, the police report says
that a man stole your wallet.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.538
Yes, at the supermarket.

28:34.538 --> 28:38.281
I leave it in the cart,
and he took it from my purse.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.805
Do you think
you could identify this man?

28:39.805 --> 28:41.154
Yes.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.896
Did the man hurt you?
Was he violent?

28:43.896 --> 28:45.941
No, but I scared.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.247
What do you mean?

28:47.247 --> 28:48.509
He had a gun.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.600
A gun?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.342
This--this wasn't
in the police report.

28:56.996 --> 29:00.695
I tried to tell you,
but you never call me back.

29:06.309 --> 29:07.571
I called her a few times.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.530
I--I tried to get a translator.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.793
But then, you know,
I got promoted to homicide,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.534
handed off the case
to another prosecutor,

29:13.534 --> 29:15.666
and that was that.
- It happens, Sam.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.365
You did what you could,
given your workload.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.585
He had a gun, Nolan.

29:22.978 --> 29:26.199
If I'd been paying
closer attention, I--

29:26.199 --> 29:30.638
I could have upped the charges
to armed robbery and got bail.

29:30.638 --> 29:31.813
Castillo would have
been locked up,

29:31.813 --> 29:34.120
and none of this
would have happened.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.338
How many
misdemeanor arraignments

29:35.338 --> 29:36.731
did you do that week?

29:36.731 --> 29:38.689
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.169
It's a mistake
any of us could have made.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.823
Too many cases,
too much crime.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.216
Impossible to keep up.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.696
But the good news is
that we have a new witness,

29:45.696 --> 29:47.829
and she's gonna help us
convict Castillo.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.708
Ms. Omari,
do you see the man

29:57.708 --> 30:00.015
who stole your purse
and pointed a gun at you?

30:00.015 --> 30:01.538
I renew my objection

30:01.538 --> 30:04.280
on the grounds of relevance,
unfair surprise,

30:04.280 --> 30:05.934
and discovery violations.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.981
Your objection is overruled.

30:08.981 --> 30:12.375
Do you see your assailant
in this courtroom?

30:12.375 --> 30:13.681
- Yes.
- Could you indicate

30:13.681 --> 30:15.683
where he's seated,
what he's wearing?

30:15.683 --> 30:18.860
He's there,
with a blue shirt.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.340
May the record reflect

30:20.340 --> 30:23.082
that the witness
has identified the defendant.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.475
It shall so reflect.

30:25.475 --> 30:27.564
Did you notice anything
about the gun

30:27.564 --> 30:28.870
the defendant was holding?

30:28.870 --> 30:33.875
Gray color
and had a long thing on it.

30:33.875 --> 30:34.876
A barrel?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.878
Yes, a barrel.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.401
Thank you.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.663
I have nothing further.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.319
I have no questions
for this witness.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.195
No cross on Jasmine?
What was that all about?

30:49.195 --> 30:51.023
Vega chooses her spots carefully.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.634
Well, she could have
challenged her identification,

30:53.634 --> 30:56.419
her ability to perceive
or even communicate.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.900
- Samantha Maroun?
- Yes?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.250
What's this?
- You've been served.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.259
"People v. Nick Castillo."

31:10.259 --> 31:11.782
A discovery request?

31:11.782 --> 31:13.784
Why would she hire
a process server to request a--

31:13.784 --> 31:16.396
It's not a request.
It's a subpoena.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.354
They want me to testify
for the defense.

31:25.492 --> 31:28.234
ADA Maroun should not
be compelled to testify

31:28.234 --> 31:29.757
in a case
that she is prosecuting.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.454
She should
when she has relevant

31:31.454 --> 31:33.543
and exculpatory evidence
to offer.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.676
What do you expect
Ms. Maroun to say?

31:35.676 --> 31:38.374
That the prosecution's
witness never told anyone

31:38.374 --> 31:41.943
until two days ago that my
client robbed her at gunpoint.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.945
Ms. Omari tried
to tell people,

31:43.945 --> 31:46.295
but she was unable
because of a language barrier.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.993
Oh,
she communicated just fine

31:47.993 --> 31:49.472
when she was
on the witness stand.

31:49.472 --> 31:50.996
Her English has improved.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.780
We'll stipulate to the fact
that Ms. Maroun

31:52.780 --> 31:54.608
never heard the witness
mention anything about a gun.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.739
That sounds reasonable.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.263
Would you agree
to a stipulation?

31:57.263 --> 31:58.917
Not in a million years.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.528
The defense counsel is trying
to distract from the fact

32:01.528 --> 32:03.965
that the defendant
murdered an unarmed man,

32:03.965 --> 32:05.184
and she is also trying

32:05.184 --> 32:07.360
to humiliate my colleague
in the process.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.840
The entire DA's office
should be ashamed

32:09.840 --> 32:10.972
of the way
they handled this case.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.713
Your Honor,
I implore you

32:12.713 --> 32:15.803
not to let defense turn this
into a sideshow.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.763
I don't appreciate
the tactics,

32:19.763 --> 32:21.461
but the defense has a right
to bring in witnesses

32:21.461 --> 32:23.898
on their own behalf.

32:23.898 --> 32:27.510
Your application to quash
the subpoena is denied.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.914
ADA Maroun, yesterday,

32:39.914 --> 32:43.700
we heard from a witness
who came into this courtroom

32:43.700 --> 32:48.357
and accused my client
of robbing her at gunpoint.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.185
Yes, I recall.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.145
And you had previously spoken
with this woman.

32:53.145 --> 32:56.017
Um, briefly.

32:56.017 --> 32:59.064
And she never mentioned
a word about a gun.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.718
Well, she tried.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.024
English is not
her first language.

33:03.024 --> 33:06.158
Can you please
answer my question?

33:06.158 --> 33:10.771
Did she or did she not
mention anything about a gun?

33:12.077 --> 33:13.992
It is not
a yes or no question.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.995
May the witness be instructed
to answer the question?

33:16.995 --> 33:21.260
Ms. Maroun, can you answer
the council's question?

33:21.260 --> 33:23.218
She did not mention anything
about a gun.

33:23.218 --> 33:26.265
And that's because
there was no gun.

33:26.265 --> 33:29.050
Isn't that true?
- No, that is not true.

33:29.050 --> 33:33.054
Isn't it a fact that your
witness came into this court

33:33.054 --> 33:35.317
and committed perjury?
- No.

33:35.317 --> 33:37.276
You suborned perjury

33:37.276 --> 33:40.366
in order to bolster evidence
in this trial.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.584
Isn't that true?

33:41.584 --> 33:43.673
Your Honor,
this is inflammatory,

33:43.673 --> 33:45.110
argumentative, badgering--

33:45.110 --> 33:46.154
Sustained.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.986
I am telling the truth
about what happened.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.161
I see.

33:53.161 --> 33:56.860
So what is this jury
supposed to infer?

33:56.860 --> 33:59.907
That you are incompetent?

33:59.907 --> 34:02.083
Unprofessional?
Derelict in your duties?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.345
Objection.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.303
Sustained.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.613
Anything else?

34:10.613 --> 34:12.398
No.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.356
I have nothing further.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.056
On the day
that this case came in,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.535
you were assigned to ECAB--

34:19.535 --> 34:21.624
the Early Case
Assessment Bureau?

34:21.624 --> 34:23.278
Yes.

34:23.278 --> 34:27.195
How many cases
did you handle that week?

34:27.195 --> 34:28.327
Hundreds.

34:28.327 --> 34:31.330
How many times
did you appear in court?

34:31.330 --> 34:32.766
Several times a day.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.333
Interview witnesses?

34:34.333 --> 34:38.206
I spoke with police officers,
detectives, firefighters,

34:38.206 --> 34:41.470
EMTs, doctors, victims,
and witnesses.

34:41.470 --> 34:42.645
Too many to count.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.085
How many times
do you get it right?

34:49.261 --> 34:50.305
Excuse me?

34:50.305 --> 34:52.264
We know you made
a single mistake,

34:52.264 --> 34:54.004
but can you tell us

34:54.004 --> 34:55.658
how many times
you didn't make a mistake?

34:55.658 --> 34:57.617
How many people you've helped?

34:57.617 --> 34:59.358
How many cases you've resolved?

34:59.358 --> 35:01.142
Objection.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.404
Sustained.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.019
Nothing further.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.518
I am so sorry
for what happened.

35:29.518 --> 35:32.869
I don't know where to begin.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.181
Are you here to fire me?

35:43.663 --> 35:46.318
I know who you are,
Ms. Maroun.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.713
I'm not sure
that's a good thing.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.808
I feel terrible, yeah.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.506
I screwed up.

36:00.506 --> 36:03.944
Like everyone else.

36:03.944 --> 36:06.947
If you don't screw up,
you're not trying hard enough.

36:11.256 --> 36:14.172
There's no time for self-pity.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.217
Get back to work

36:16.217 --> 36:21.353
and figure out how to put
the gun in Castillo's hands.

36:42.939 --> 36:46.378
One, two, three, four, five.

36:53.123 --> 36:56.170
Detective Shaw.
ADA Samantha Maroun.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.041
Sorry to call you so late,

36:58.041 --> 37:01.306
but I need to talk to you
about the Castillo case.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.878
Mr. Gwynn, you're here
under a cooperation agreement?

37:08.878 --> 37:10.097
Yes.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.752
You worked for Eddie Wells?

37:12.752 --> 37:14.841
I stole stuff.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.146
Sold it to Eddie.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.148
Did Mr. Wells supply you
with a weapon

37:18.148 --> 37:19.672
to help you
carry out your thefts?

37:19.672 --> 37:21.935
Objection. Leading.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.806
You may answer.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.155
He gave me a gun.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.461
Objection. Relevance.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.202
Overruled.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.117
Let's see where this goes.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.945
Why did he give you a gun?

37:31.945 --> 37:33.642
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.514
Well, let me rephrase.

37:35.514 --> 37:41.041
Did Eddie Wells tell you
why he gave you a gun?

37:41.041 --> 37:42.695
- Yes.
- What did he say?

37:42.695 --> 37:43.957
Calls for a hearsay.

37:43.957 --> 37:45.480
Statement
against penal interest.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.308
Overruled.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.310
Things were getting
more intense lately.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.965
People in the stores,
the security guards,

37:51.965 --> 37:53.836
and the customers
started to push back,

37:53.836 --> 37:55.969
so we needed protection.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.145
So Eddie gave us guns.

37:58.145 --> 38:01.148
Told us to flash them
when people got aggressive.

38:02.671 --> 38:05.587
Mr. Gwynn, do you know
the defendant, Nick Castillo?

38:05.587 --> 38:07.067
Yeah.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.852
Do you know if Mr. Wells
ever gave a gun to him?

38:13.334 --> 38:14.117
I do.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.771
He gave one to him

38:15.771 --> 38:18.905
the same day he gave one to me
and to all the other guys.

38:18.905 --> 38:21.255
We were all
in the warehouse together.

38:21.255 --> 38:24.606
Were they all
the same caliber?

38:24.606 --> 38:26.826
Yes, all revolvers.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.524
Ruger GP100s.

38:29.524 --> 38:30.569
Thank you.

38:36.879 --> 38:37.924
Nothing further.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.374
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

38:55.463 --> 38:56.725
Yes, Your Honor.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.989
In the matter
of People v. Nick Castillo,

38:59.989 --> 39:01.382
as to count one

39:01.382 --> 39:04.690
of the indictment murder
in the second degree,

39:04.690 --> 39:06.692
what say you?

39:06.692 --> 39:08.389
We find the defendant guilty.

39:11.784 --> 39:15.222
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.790
You're dismissed.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.922
I will be in touch.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.402
Don't.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.194
Still at it?

39:31.194 --> 39:33.414
Conveyor belt of justice.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.901
Thank you.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.642
For what?

39:43.642 --> 39:44.991
Winning the trial.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.387
If it weren't for you,

39:49.387 --> 39:54.566
Castillo would have walked out
of here a free man yet again.

39:54.566 --> 39:55.958
If it weren't for me...

39:58.178 --> 40:01.616
Perry Sutton
would still be alive.
