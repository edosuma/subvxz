WEBVTT

00:07.355 --> 00:09.705
Tell me again
exactly what happened.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.665
[sighs] Archie and I
were in his room,

00:13.709 --> 00:15.537
and then I got
the phone call.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.061
And you didn't recognize
the voice?

00:18.105 --> 00:21.282
The connection was pretty bad,
but it was a man.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.197
He said that we needed
to get out of the house,

00:23.240 --> 00:24.633
that there was a bomb
under the bed.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.503
We have to go.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.811
Yeah, so we ran downstairs,

00:28.854 --> 00:30.465
slid under
the dining room table

00:30.508 --> 00:31.640
right when
the bomb went off.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.035
And Jughead, you were...

00:35.078 --> 00:37.124
I was in the garage.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.087
Wow. This is unbelievable.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.222
I think the three of you
need to go to the hospital.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.571
We're fine.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.181
Yeah. Mom, we really
don't need to go.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.270
I just honestly don't have
insurance for that, so...

00:53.314 --> 00:54.663
Okay, well, fine.
The two of you stay.

00:54.706 --> 00:55.968
But Betty,
you're coming with me.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.753
We're gonna get you
checked out.

00:57.796 --> 00:58.928
You could have a concussion
and not even know about it.

00:58.971 --> 00:59.972
Come with me.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.688
[Frank] Walk me
through this again, Archie.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.082
You and Betty ran into
the dining room and hid?

01:22.908 --> 01:24.084
Under which table?

01:25.737 --> 01:27.130
The one that's
completely crushed?

01:30.307 --> 01:31.308
[dog whimpering]

01:35.225 --> 01:36.183
Bingo.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.669
[Tabitha] Enjoy.

01:44.713 --> 01:45.714
[door opens]

01:45.757 --> 01:46.584
Jughead?

01:47.542 --> 01:48.369
[exhales]

01:49.631 --> 01:50.632
What happened?

01:51.763 --> 01:55.158
Archie's house... blew up.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
-What?
-Yeah, everyone's fine.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.379
But "An Explosion
on Elm Street..."

01:58.422 --> 02:00.729
This is a huge story
for our town.

02:00.772 --> 02:03.340
I need to get on it ASAP,
so can I...

02:03.384 --> 02:05.821
can I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

02:05.864 --> 02:07.431
-Of course.
-Thank you.

02:09.868 --> 02:10.869
Thanks.

02:17.311 --> 02:18.312
[bell dinging]

02:19.226 --> 02:20.183
[high-pitched ringing]

02:26.581 --> 02:31.020
[sighs] As you both know,
I've always wanted to make it
on Broadway.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.196
Well, it's time I gave New York
another shot.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.026
That's great.
Good for you, Kev.

02:37.069 --> 02:40.551
Since you're being honest,
uh, we have something
we need to tell you too.

02:42.597 --> 02:43.511
Toni and I...

02:45.687 --> 02:46.688
are dating.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.126
How did that happen?

02:50.170 --> 02:54.478
I guess becoming parents
and living together,

02:54.522 --> 02:58.221
it changed our connection
from platonic to romantic.

02:58.265 --> 03:02.443
Yeah, sometimes
the best relationships
start out as friendships.

03:02.486 --> 03:06.360
Um, I will admit that
I'm a little bit surprised.

03:06.403 --> 03:10.842
Yeah, but for the record,
we're both still
very much bisexual.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.540
And proud to be part
of the queer community.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.456
Amen to that.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.500
[cell phone ringing]

03:19.416 --> 03:20.635
Hey, Dad. What's up?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.465
A bomb went off?

03:25.509 --> 03:26.554
Where?

03:26.597 --> 03:28.164
[cell phone ringing]

03:28.208 --> 03:29.209
Kevin, what's up?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.298
What is it?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.084
My father.

03:35.127 --> 03:38.479
He blew up Archie's house.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.049
Mistress Cheryl.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.272
Brittania, can't you see
I'm doing scholarly research?

03:49.316 --> 03:51.579
A bomb went off
at the Andrews house.

03:51.622 --> 03:54.103
Apparently, Mr. Andrews
and Miss Cooper were inside,

03:54.146 --> 03:55.626
and Mr. Jones
was in the garage.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.671
Oh, dear.

03:58.107 --> 04:01.545
-Were they killed?
-No, they're alive.

04:01.589 --> 04:06.071
-Somehow.
-I don't understand.
A... a bomb?

04:06.115 --> 04:07.464
How could a bomb...

04:09.684 --> 04:12.382
Nana, Abigail's curse,

04:12.426 --> 04:13.992
the one against
Archibald Andrews,

04:14.036 --> 04:15.777
Jedediah Jones,
and Beatrice Cooper,

04:15.820 --> 04:18.301
was that for realzies?

04:18.345 --> 04:20.651
Who can say?

04:20.695 --> 04:23.088
Where's the parchment
with the curse on it, Nana?

04:23.132 --> 04:27.571
If my speaking the words aloud
somehow revived it to hex
Archie, Betty and Jughead,

04:27.615 --> 04:29.312
I need to study it.

04:29.356 --> 04:34.274
Why, you seemed so upset
after you read Abigail's words,

04:34.317 --> 04:35.797
I burned it.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.539
Nana, that's lunacy.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.150
Not only did you manipulate me
into invoking the curse,

04:41.193 --> 04:43.152
which, it turns out,
may be real,

04:43.195 --> 04:48.723
you've now ruined
my best chance of learning
how to reverse it.

04:48.766 --> 04:52.466
Luckily, the Blossom library
is full of arcane texts

04:52.509 --> 04:54.598
about witches
and their wicked ways.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.300
[dogs barking in distance]

05:03.738 --> 05:05.348
Have you called your mom?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.263
No. Not yet.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.351
I don't want to worry her.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.092
It's her house, Archie.

05:10.875 --> 05:11.789
[door opens]

05:12.834 --> 05:14.662
Are you Bingo's dads?

05:14.705 --> 05:15.880
[both] Yeah.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.795
The good news is
Bingo is alive.

05:19.101 --> 05:22.147
But all four of his legs
were broken.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.586
I'd like to keep Bingo here
for a week.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.239
Keep track
of his healing process

05:27.283 --> 05:29.416
and make sure
his bones set properly.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.635
You have a very lucky dog,
Mr. Andrews.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.711
-Hey.
-[chuckles] Hi.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.887
Uh, I figured you would be
in the zone,

06:05.930 --> 06:07.715
so I brought you some dinner.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.153
How's writing going?

06:11.196 --> 06:14.635
Uh, yeah.
Um, it's good. It's going. I...

06:14.678 --> 06:18.943
It started as an article
about the destruction
of a cherished family home.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.469
But I figured what better time
to expose Hiram Lodge
for the villain that he is.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.994
Well, please do not
let me interrupt.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.431
Write one hell
of an expose, Jug.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.565
And pound those nails
into Hiram Lodge's coffin.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.609
[Jughead exhales]

06:35.917 --> 06:36.918

-[people speaking indistinctly]

06:43.794 --> 06:45.622
Enough's enough, Toni.

06:45.666 --> 06:50.148
The Ghoulies fire-bombed Pop's,
they blew up Archie's house.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.063
We need to go nuclear on them.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.891
Look, I understand
the impulse, Fangs.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.719
We have Baby Anthony
to think about now.

06:55.763 --> 07:00.158
We can't just be as reckless
as we once were.

07:00.202 --> 07:03.553
I have intel that
the Ghoulies have
a new leader from Chicago.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.121
Name of Twyla Twyst.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.079
Let's call her in
for a sit-down

07:08.123 --> 07:10.038
and try and de-escalate things.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.873
Do you really think
this is gonna work,
Mistress Cheryl?

07:18.916 --> 07:23.965
The best way to nullify a curse
is with reversing candles
made from beeswax.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.533
As the candles burn down,
the curse melts away.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.796
So, in less than 24 hours,

07:28.839 --> 07:33.975
all of the nastiness
I've called down upon Betty,
on Archie and Jughead

07:34.018 --> 07:36.630
should be rendered
null and void.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.109
Mistress Blossom...

07:39.546 --> 07:44.028
do we now believe
in magic and curses?

07:44.072 --> 07:46.422
I believe there was once a time

07:46.466 --> 07:50.513
where a magic and superstition
were a part of the daily fabric
of our lives.

07:50.557 --> 07:54.256
Given what
we've been experiencing
as of late, Britta,

07:54.299 --> 07:58.913
I believe a new
Age of Wonderment is upon us.

07:58.956 --> 08:03.483
I had to silence my phone
because everyone keeps texting
and calling to check in.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.573
Me too.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.010
I talked to my mom.
She's flying in from Chicago.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.404
How long do you
have to stay here?

08:13.841 --> 08:16.539
Just overnight for observation.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.063
-Except for two cracked ribs...
-[sighs]

08:19.890 --> 08:21.326
I'm fine.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.024
You shielded me.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.547
How?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.811
How did I shield you?

08:27.855 --> 08:30.292
We were right there
in the room
when the bomb went off.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.951
I'm not sure.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.910
But if you hadn't thrown
yourself in front of me...

08:41.869 --> 08:44.262
pulled me in tight,
and shielded me
with your body,

08:44.306 --> 08:47.918
then I wouldn't be here
talking to you right now.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.751
What happened to us, Betty?

08:54.795 --> 08:56.100
What's happening to me?

08:58.407 --> 08:59.408
I don't know.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.693
Which one of you Delilahs
blew out my reversing candles?

09:24.781 --> 09:27.175
It wasn't me. I would never.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.352
Perhaps it was a night breeze.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
Says the old maid
who tricked me

09:32.397 --> 09:35.183
into putting a curse
on my school chums
in the first place?

09:36.837 --> 09:40.623
Never touch my altar again.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.582
Or perhaps
I'll put a curse on you next.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.678
Thanks for humoring me, honey.

09:51.721 --> 09:54.245
I was just so worried
that you had a concussion
or internal bleeding.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.769
Thank God you're okay.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.702

10:25.276 --> 10:26.756

10:26.800 --> 10:29.585
-[cell phone ringing]
-What were you saying?

10:29.629 --> 10:33.328
-I was just quoting
your genius article.
-[chuckles]

10:33.371 --> 10:36.418
But your phone's ringing,
and you didn't notice it.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.641
Hello. This is Jones.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.557
Yes, of course I do.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.385
It's the Wall Beat Journal.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.387
Yeah, that's the correct email.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.955
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.872
The Wall Beat Journal
wants to run my article.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.961
-What? Oh, my God.
-Nationally.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.963
They said they've been
trying to nail Hiram Lodge
for years too.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.009
That's huge, Jug.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.445
What were you saying
about my genius, again?

11:05.882 --> 11:08.493
I have to assume
this was my father's doing.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.148
Yeah, if it wasn't Hiram
who put the bomb
under Archie's bed,

11:11.192 --> 11:14.195
then he probably
paid someone to do it.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.501
But, on the plus side,
the FBI's finally making

11:16.545 --> 11:18.590
Hiram's immediate capture
a priority.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.592
And I want to help.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.682
I'm reaching out to Hermosa
to get information

11:22.725 --> 11:25.206
about my father's
below-board operations,

11:25.249 --> 11:27.382
the locations
of his safe houses,

11:27.425 --> 11:29.819
his known
and suspected contacts,

11:29.863 --> 11:33.344
anything and everything
that will help bring him in.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.042
Thank you, Vee.
I appreciate it.

11:37.871 --> 11:38.959
[breathing heavily]

12:10.381 --> 12:11.774
One-hundred
and ninety-three pounds.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.697
I was 165 last week.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.221
[Alice] I just got a call
from RIVW.

12:24.265 --> 12:28.617
Apparently, there was quite
the scene that happened after
we left Riverdale General.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.836
What happened?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.794
Details are still coming in,

12:31.838 --> 12:34.362
but they found a nurse
in a dumpster
behind the hospital.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.406
Throat slit.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.545
That's awful.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.636
-[Hermosa] Papi did what?
-You heard me.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.247
He crossed
the ultimate line, Hermosa,

12:50.291 --> 12:53.511
and nearly killed
an FBI agent in the process.

12:53.555 --> 12:57.211
Which is why they're now
leading a nationwide manhunt.

12:57.254 --> 13:02.433
Do yourself a favor
and help me help them.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.828
Tell me where he goes
when he wants to disappear.

13:05.872 --> 13:09.789
I'll need immunity for myself,
and give me a few hours.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.094
Thank you, Hermosa.

Thank you, Glen.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.111
Really, you did not
need to do that.

13:28.155 --> 13:32.420
Okay. Hiram Lodge
has been a person of interest
for the last several years,

13:32.463 --> 13:35.205
and as of two days ago,
he is now on our
Most Wanted List.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.860
In those files, you will find
his possible whereabouts,

13:37.904 --> 13:40.210
known associates,
financial records, phone data.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.865
I'm expecting fresh intel
later today.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.345
But this should be enough
to get you started.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.177
[Betty] Agent Lin,
would you mind helping me
with something off-case?

13:50.220 --> 13:52.353
Of course. What do you need?

13:52.396 --> 13:55.356
A nurse was murdered at
Riverdale General Hospital
today,

13:55.399 --> 13:57.401
a young woman, in her 20s.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.751
Would you mind
looking into an orderly
who's employed there?

13:59.795 --> 14:01.841
Uh, first name Trevor.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.582
Okay. You think
he's responsible?

14:04.626 --> 14:05.888
Right now it's just a hunch.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.585
Thank you.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.593
Talked to my dad.
Told him I needed to step away
from the dealership.

14:15.637 --> 14:16.856
So we...

14:18.118 --> 14:19.815
can focus on the casino.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
That's good.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.952
Ronnie, what's that?

14:25.995 --> 14:29.956
Privileged information about
my father's criminal empire.

14:29.999 --> 14:35.613
Everything you would need
to hunt him down
and make him pay.

14:36.614 --> 14:37.920
For the FBI?

14:37.964 --> 14:38.921
No.

14:39.704 --> 14:40.792
Not the FBI.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.579
Daddy's had many chances.

14:46.233 --> 14:51.020
A more... permanent solution
needs to happen.

14:53.327 --> 14:57.287
Which is why I am reaching out
to the underworld...

14:58.898 --> 15:01.944
and putting a bounty
on his head.

15:01.988 --> 15:05.687
Ronnie, no matter
what Hiram did,
he's still your dad.

15:05.730 --> 15:09.560
It's an act
of self-preservation.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.563
My father will never stop
gunning for us.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.352
[elevator bell dings]

15:21.616 --> 15:23.009
[footsteps approaching]

15:26.273 --> 15:28.101
And where have you been
tonight, Glen?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.407
Just had some dinner,

15:30.451 --> 15:32.540
stopped off for a few beers,
you know.

15:34.629 --> 15:35.630
Hey.

15:36.457 --> 15:37.458
You, uh...

15:38.938 --> 15:40.113
You seeing anyone lately?

15:41.766 --> 15:43.855
Yeah. Archie.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.381
[laughs] Come on.

15:47.424 --> 15:51.646
That pipsqueak?
He satisfies you, really?

15:51.689 --> 15:53.517
A lot more than you ever did.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.868
Oh, come on, Betty.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.089
You know you want this.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.092
Don't.

16:05.790 --> 16:06.617
[Betty grunts]

16:08.837 --> 16:09.881
[grunts, spits]

16:13.407 --> 16:14.495
You're crazy, you know that?

16:15.583 --> 16:16.845
You have no idea.

16:36.778 --> 16:37.779
It's okay, Mom.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.520
It's just stuff.

16:40.738 --> 16:41.739
Things that can be replaced.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.788
I'm not crying
about that, Archie.

16:46.831 --> 16:50.009
I'm just imagining you here
when it happened.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.533
You could have died.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.666
How did you not die?

16:55.710 --> 16:58.278
In all seriousness,
look at this place.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.631
I think I know.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.330
It was your father.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.162
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.686
It was your dad.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.386
It's his house.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.519
He was looking out for you.

17:23.738 --> 17:24.826
And for Betty.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.537
[Veronica] Thank you
for coming, Anatol.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.670
I have prepared
this dossier of information

17:42.713 --> 17:45.368
I believe you'll find
very useful.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.456
How much is the bounty?

17:50.765 --> 17:52.419
A cool two million.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.855
Do you want him dead or alive?

17:57.119 --> 18:00.557
I don't want him to hurt me
or my friends ever again.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.777
I see. Dead, then.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.259
I understand and will comply.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.391
[cell phone ringing]

18:11.568 --> 18:13.135
Reggie, can I call you back?

18:13.179 --> 18:16.138
[Reggie] Ronnie,
I'm at the hospital.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.140
My dad just had a heart attack
at the dealership.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.407
You've been
keeping busy, Topaz.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.584
Councilwoman, new mom,
small business owner.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.152
Sweet place, by the way.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.676
We asked you here
to propose a cease fire, Twyla.

18:34.374 --> 18:37.159
Now that Hiram's gone
and the Feds are on his ass,

18:37.203 --> 18:40.162
there's nobody
funding your crew.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.165
Maybe we can broker
an agreement.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.688
You're wrong about Lodge.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.344
When Hiram left town,
he made us a deal.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.868
As long as we keep doing
what he asked,

18:50.912 --> 18:54.045
he'll make a monthly deposit
into a private account for us

18:54.089 --> 18:55.482
from a third-party bank,
of course.

18:55.525 --> 18:58.615
What did that scumbag
ask you to do?

18:58.659 --> 19:01.227
One, destroy Riverdale.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.143
And two, kill Archie Andrews.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.757
And by the way,
I only took this meeting
out of courtesy.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.715
And to see for myself

19:11.759 --> 19:15.328
what kind of threat
the Southside Serpents
might be.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.069
From where I'm sitting,
we're looking fine.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.941
All right, I'm done.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.290
You can get
the hell out of my bar.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.555
No problem.
I'll be back soon enough.

19:27.035 --> 19:27.862
Let's go.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.213
[Fogarty scoffs]

20:36.147 --> 20:38.454
[Mary] Archie, Toni and Fangs
are here to see you.

20:41.588 --> 20:45.418
So their leader, Twyla Twyst,
told you guys all this?

20:45.461 --> 20:48.159
She's stone-cold crazy, Archie.
Like all the Ghoulies.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.074
[Toni] Just so
for your own safety,

20:50.118 --> 20:52.294
we think it's best
if get out of Riverdale
as fast you can.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.993
The Ghoulies, they still live
down by the docks, don't they?

20:58.126 --> 21:00.302
Yeah.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.218
But Archie, neither you nor we
have the fire-power
to go against them.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.828
We'll need to call
reinforcements first.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.569
We're just waiting
to hear back from FP.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.789
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

21:08.832 --> 21:12.488
I just want to know
which neighborhood
to steer clear of, that's all.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.017
[scoffs]

21:20.061 --> 21:21.802
Unbelievable.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.717
What infernal game
is my nana playing?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.589
[sighs]

21:26.633 --> 21:29.897
Time to catch this
septuagenarian saboteur
crimson-handed.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.291
Come on, Brittania.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.557
Your instincts
about that orderly

21:37.600 --> 21:39.863
-were spot-on, Agent Cooper.
-Hmm.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.431
Trevor Collins has a sketchy
employment history.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.651
He's worked
at multiple hospitals
around the country

21:44.694 --> 21:46.435
and always seems to leave
after a few months.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.176
Sometimes he quits,
and sometimes he's fired.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.483
Any convictions?

21:50.526 --> 21:52.354
In and out of juvie, then did
six months at Shankshaw
for drug possession.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.401
Interesting.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.141
Every hospital has
their own in-house pharmacy.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.405
I wonder if there's been
any thefts reported recently.

22:01.494 --> 22:04.497
Agent Cooper,
there's one more thing
you should know.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.368
A bunch of us
were working out together
this morning,

22:06.412 --> 22:08.370
Agent Scot included.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.937
And he started saying things
about you.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.897
Really? What did Glen say?

22:13.941 --> 22:16.030
That you two reconnected.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.901
That things got steamy,

22:17.945 --> 22:20.077
and that you
accidentally elbowed him
in the nose during--

22:20.121 --> 22:21.862
I get it, yeah.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.081
Um, thank you
for letting me know, Marsha.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.480
[indistinct conversations]

22:40.837 --> 22:42.273
Hey, Twyla.

22:44.754 --> 22:45.581
Damn.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.934
And I thought
the Ghoulies had a death wish.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.329
Does anyone wanna tell me
which one of you bums
put a bomb under my bed?

22:58.202 --> 22:59.726
Or do things have to get messy?

23:11.259 --> 23:12.826
You know, what kills me
the most...

23:16.046 --> 23:18.266
is that we were finally
in a good place.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.358
I just thought
we had more time.

23:24.185 --> 23:25.012
[sniffles]

23:27.493 --> 23:28.494
Of course.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.236
And you will, Reggie.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.024
Do you think
you'll spend the night here?

23:37.981 --> 23:39.156
Definitely, yeah.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.901
In that case, let me...
let me go home and pack
an overnight bag for you.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.257
[sniffles]

24:01.396 --> 24:02.397
[line ringing]

24:04.007 --> 24:05.487
-Hello.
-[Anatol] Da.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.141
-Anatol, is that you?
-[Anatol] Yes.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.491
I was about to call you,
Miss Lodge.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.666
It's done.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.104
What?

24:14.148 --> 24:16.455
What... what do you mean
it's done?

24:16.498 --> 24:17.891
Already? How is that possible?

24:17.934 --> 24:20.676
What can I say?
I'm a professional.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.938
Check your inbox.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.420
[Veronica breathing shakily]

24:29.424 --> 24:30.425
[gasps]

24:32.253 --> 24:33.254
[crying]

24:39.347 --> 24:41.915
Oh, my God.
What happened now?

24:41.958 --> 24:43.482
Some Ghoulies tried to mug me.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.787
Where are you hurt?

24:44.831 --> 24:46.702
Nowhere. It's not my blood.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.574
It's all theirs.
I don't have a scratch on me.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.447
What are you doing here?

24:52.491 --> 24:55.189
Get yourself cleaned up.
I need your help
with something.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.285
Could I get a refill
on this coffee?

25:05.895 --> 25:06.896
Hey, buddy.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.159
I'm talking to you.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.557
I've got your refill
right here, sir.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.994
Sorry for the delay.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.606
[Tabitha] Jughead,
what is up with you?

25:20.649 --> 25:22.956
I mean, couldn't you hear him?

25:22.999 --> 25:25.393
Yeah. I... I could.
I was just in my head.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.309
No, no. No, I know
when you're "in your head."

25:29.310 --> 25:30.703
This is something else.

25:31.399 --> 25:32.400
Try again.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.316
The truth this time.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.581
The explosion
really messed up my hearing.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.019
Did a lot of damage.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.241
I'm just afraid
it's getting worse.

26:00.297 --> 26:03.910
Hi. I'm Agent Cooper
with the FBI.

26:03.953 --> 26:06.173
Do you mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

26:06.216 --> 26:08.175
What's this all about?

26:08.218 --> 26:10.438
It's about the murder
that took place here
two nights ago.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.527
Oh, yeah.

26:13.397 --> 26:14.703
I heard about that.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.706
So, tell me, Trevor,

26:17.750 --> 26:19.490
why were you fired
from St. Michael's Hospital
eight months ago?

26:20.840 --> 26:22.668
I... I wasn't fired.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.278
I quit.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.976
Oh.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.500
So it wasn't because
you were caught stealing
drugs from the pharmacy?

26:32.939 --> 26:35.898
And you didn't
kill the nurse here
for that exact same reason,

26:35.942 --> 26:38.509
because she caught you
with your hand
in the cookie jar?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.907
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, bro.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.909
Not unless you want me
to break both your arms.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.695
He'll do it too.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
-[rock music playing]
-[people speaking indistinctly]

27:02.708 --> 27:04.100
Since the explosion...

27:05.493 --> 27:06.973
I've started to see...

27:08.365 --> 27:09.802
How do I describe this?

27:09.845 --> 27:14.458
Um, I can see people's energy,

27:14.502 --> 27:17.548
if it's threatening,
like their auras.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.204
-Is that crazy?
-No. No.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.829
Betty, I'm getting
heavier, denser.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.048
Also invulnerable.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.660
Until I figure out
what's happening to me,

27:41.703 --> 27:44.140
I am afraid
I might hurt people.

27:46.229 --> 27:49.406
-I might hurt you.
-Archie, you can't.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.931
I told you, I see threats.

27:51.974 --> 27:55.456
I saw it with that orderly.
I saw it with Glen.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.850
Glen? Your boss?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.723
[sighs]

28:01.767 --> 28:05.945
Back in Quantico
when I was a trainee,
we had a brief thing.

28:05.988 --> 28:10.340
And last night,
he was drunk
and he got handsy.

28:10.384 --> 28:13.343
But it's fine.
I'm taking care of it.
You don't have to do anything.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.607
Okay?

28:16.651 --> 28:21.221
But I don't want you to be
afraid of hurting me, Arch.
Because I'm not.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.490
[chiming twice]

28:45.898 --> 28:47.769
[Cheryl] Britta?

28:47.813 --> 28:48.988
What are you doing in here?

28:58.519 --> 29:00.260
I'm not Britta.

29:05.569 --> 29:06.527
Abigail?

29:15.579 --> 29:16.755
[clock ticking]

29:24.980 --> 29:26.025
Nana...

29:27.853 --> 29:32.379
something is
very wrong with Britta.

29:32.422 --> 29:36.252
I caught her trying
to blow out the candles
in the alter last night,
