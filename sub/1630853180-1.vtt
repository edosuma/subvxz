WEBVTT

00:32.407 --> 00:34.075
- These things
will stop a bullet?

00:34.159 --> 00:35.160
- No.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.536
They will not shoot you
in a public place.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.289
- What a relief.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.084
- These are for knives.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.628
- Great.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.233
- When we sit down with them,

01:07.317 --> 01:09.319
you're gonna order
a black coffee.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.779
- What's this guy's rank?

01:13.198 --> 01:17.577
Speak as little as possible.
Let them do the talking.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.675
Um, okay, did everyone practice
their assignment?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.260
all: Yes.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.554
- Uh, Mrs. Morimoto,
how about you go first?

05:46.637 --> 05:47.346
Hello.
- Hello.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.516
Is this Mr. Adelstein?
- Speaking.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.811
- This is Mrs. Morimoto.
I was won--

05:53.895 --> 05:55.396
- Wondering.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.607
- Wondering if you come
to dinner tonight.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.817
- We would love to.
- Okay.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.861
- Thank you very much.
Okay, that's it for today.

06:01.944 --> 06:02.945
I'll see you guys next week.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.115
Arigato gozaimashita.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.997
- Hai.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.079
- Hey, Jake!

08:18.414 --> 08:19.957
- Oh!
- Hey!

08:20.041 --> 08:22.084
- What's up?
I thought you were going home.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.086
- I am. Just got done packing.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.715
Hey, if this don't work out,

08:27.798 --> 08:29.091
come to Austin and say hi.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.761
- I will.
- All right.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.304
Huh? Oh.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.538
Hai.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.333
Hai.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.088
- Hai.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.091
- You wish to be
a crime reporter in Japan.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.093
Why?

16:51.176 --> 16:51.760
- My father is a coroner,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.679
and he took me to crime scenes,

16:53.762 --> 16:57.933
showed me bodies, murder files.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.728
I found trying to reason
what actually happened

17:00.811 --> 17:02.730
from forensic evidence
fascinating.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.320
- Your written Japanese
is excellent.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.989
- Thank you.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.824
- So how do you explain this?

17:17.202 --> 17:19.038
- I did not pay
close enough attention.

17:20.205 --> 17:24.168
- Even with what you missed,
your score was high.

17:26.545 --> 17:31.633
The Tokyo "Meicho Shimbun"
has 12 million readers a day,

17:31.717 --> 17:34.511
the greatest newspaper
in Japan,

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
the best newspaper
in the world.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.808
No foreigner
has worked here ever.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.603
- I understand.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.795
- I'm not your friend,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.757
so you're about
a thousand hours too early

20:16.840 --> 20:18.967
in this relationship
to call me Emi.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.638
As your superior
and your senpai,

20:22.721 --> 20:25.641
you will pay me the courtesy
of using Maruyama-san.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.643
Are we clear?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.895
- Yes, totally.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.483
- You think because
you're a foreigner,

20:34.566 --> 20:35.734
the rules are different?

20:38.654 --> 20:41.490
Not in this company
and not with me.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.827
- Huh?

21:48.974 --> 21:52.144
- Kanpai!
all: Kanpai!

22:30.891 --> 22:31.349
- Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.070
- Hey, Jake!

22:55.749 --> 22:58.126
- What?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.878
- Mos-sad.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.174
Everyone here thinks
you're a spy for the Israelis.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.760
Mos-sad.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.137
I'm from Mos-souri.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.806
- Okay, James Bond.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.979
- These guys are all in.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.775
- Super hard-core.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.946
- She's gotta pour drinks
all night?

23:27.239 --> 23:27.447
Yeah, that's fucked up.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.329
How much did you study
for the test?

23:36.414 --> 23:39.376
For the entrance exam,
how much did you study?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.671
- Who studied?
- You had to study?

28:01.388 --> 28:02.722
- Who's that guy?

28:06.101 --> 28:08.228
- Miyamoto.

28:08.311 --> 28:12.524
Prostitution, weapons.

28:12.607 --> 28:12.649
Badass.

28:16.277 --> 28:19.447
They say he loves chickens.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.532
- Chicks.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.827
- Chicks?

28:23.910 --> 28:25.120
- Yeah.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.122
- Not chickens?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.248
- Trust me.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.524
- The dead body by the bridge.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.652
The home address
is in the number one report.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.654
Write it up, 500 characters,
end of day.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.322
- Hai. Hai.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.250
- Hai.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.008
- Hai.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.973
- I'm sorry, I--I don't mean
to get you in trouble.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.142
- I can take care of myself,
thank you.

33:39.225 --> 33:42.395
- I just think--
- You don't get to think.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.229
You will follow the rules

33:43.312 --> 33:45.106
and write what you are told
to write,

33:45.189 --> 33:47.442
like everyone else,
or you will be gone.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.917
- No, I'm not gonna regurgitate

34:05.001 --> 34:06.544
the police report
word for word.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.004
- Regurgitate?
- Yeah, that's not reporting.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.547
- So what did you do?

34:09.630 --> 34:10.673
- Oh, I went
to the stabbed guy's house,

34:10.757 --> 34:13.176
and, uh,
I went through his mail.

34:14.093 --> 34:17.472
- What are you gonna do,
call the mail police?

34:17.555 --> 34:19.140
- Maybe.
- Did you find anything?

34:19.223 --> 34:21.809
- There were bunch of overdue
bills from a loan company.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.645
So the guy was clearly
in debt to this company.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.314
I copied down the logo,
the address.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.608
You recognize this logo?

34:28.691 --> 34:30.443
both: Nope.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.236
- I went to the address,
and there was nothing there.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.696
Like, the loan company
was gone.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.490
- So no story?
- After all.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.784
- Not a complete story
but a beginning of a story,

34:37.867 --> 34:39.410
so I wrote it up,
handed it in...

34:41.412 --> 34:42.663
Got wrung out
for not copying down

34:42.747 --> 34:46.083
word for word a fucking--

35:41.681 --> 35:45.393
Miyamoto-san. Jake.

35:45.476 --> 35:48.855
I'm a crime reporter
for the "Meicho," and, uh--

35:48.938 --> 35:50.273
No, no, I--
can I buy you a drink?

35:50.356 --> 35:52.400
- Why?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.568
- I'm trying to figure out

35:53.651 --> 35:55.069
how reporters work with police,

35:55.152 --> 35:56.571
and maybe you could
show me the ropes.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.155
- Ropes?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.949
- Yeah.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.325
It's a--
- Show you the ropes?

36:01.409 --> 36:02.451
- Yeah.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.961
- Miyamoto-san--
- Uh, I like gaijin

36:12.044 --> 36:13.337
but only with tits.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.385
Oi, oi!

36:19.468 --> 36:23.055
Tell me, do you know
how to pick up gaijin girls?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.933
- Absolutely.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.560
- I have to say,

36:27.643 --> 36:30.229
I find your dress,
uh, extra flattering?

36:30.313 --> 36:32.106
- No, no, no.
Extraordinarily flattering.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.649
- Extraordinarily.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.234
- And it's got to be
sophisticated, smooth.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.235
Just roll it out.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.612
- I have to say,

36:37.695 --> 36:38.988
I find your dress

36:39.071 --> 36:40.156
extraordinarily flattering.

36:53.210 --> 36:55.630
- And this shit works?
- Yes.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.216
Western girls, they like a guy
who's flirtatious, debonair.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.718
Trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.844
- Okay.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.985
- That was really great.

40:05.069 --> 40:05.653
You were really good up there.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.656
- Thanks, I try.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.324
- Do you wanna have a drink?

40:10.407 --> 40:10.449
- Sure.

40:23.921 --> 40:24.964
- Yeah.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.679
- Your Japanese is very good.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.722
- Thank you.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.892
- Why are you hanging out
with cops?

40:38.769 --> 40:40.980
- Because I'm a reporter
for the "Meicho."

40:41.981 --> 40:44.191
- No. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.568
- An American.

40:47.444 --> 40:50.489
Well, what do you report on?

40:50.573 --> 40:51.448
- Uh, I'm on the police beat.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.369
- Hmm.

40:55.452 --> 40:58.622
So stories
about guys like that?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.084
- You never know.

41:02.168 --> 41:05.004
- Really, what do you
report on?

41:06.130 --> 41:09.758
- You know, you never know
who you're gonna talk to,

41:09.842 --> 41:12.386
where you're gonna go,
what you're gonna see.

41:12.469 --> 41:13.888
Every day is different.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.225
- Is this what you wear
to work every day?

41:18.309 --> 41:22.229
- No, I--
the paper's got

41:22.313 --> 41:24.398
these strict regulations
on what you have to wear,

41:24.481 --> 41:29.236
so I wear a suit and tie
and, uh, so...

41:29.320 --> 41:34.450
I'm trying really hard
to get it right,

41:34.533 --> 41:38.621
you know, to fit
into their system, which...

41:40.164 --> 41:42.917
Is mentally tyrannical,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.003
which is not what I expected
from a newspaper, you know?

41:47.213 --> 41:48.672
- Yeah.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.091
Yeah, I know how rigid
corporate life can be.

41:52.676 --> 41:53.469
So why are you doing this?

41:54.511 --> 41:59.808
- Well, I wanna report
on what really happens.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.647
That's it.

42:06.857 --> 42:07.858
That's...

42:11.654 --> 42:13.405
I mean, you know,

42:13.489 --> 42:18.827
maybe someday make
a small piece of history.

42:21.413 --> 42:23.040
- So is it gonna work?

42:23.123 --> 42:24.291
- So far, it seems like

42:24.375 --> 42:26.502
everything I've touched,
I've...

42:28.087 --> 42:30.798
Screwed up.

42:30.881 --> 42:34.551
But giving up and going home
is not an option.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.095
You know what I mean?

42:36.178 --> 42:37.930
- I know exactly what you mean.

42:41.475 --> 42:41.558
- Where are you from?

42:43.185 --> 42:45.562
- Saitama, originally,

42:45.646 --> 42:48.232
but I've been in Tokyo
for the past few years.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.405
- Well, but before that,
where are you from?

42:56.198 --> 42:57.574
- Well, that's a second
bottle question, honey.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.000
See, how this works is,

43:06.083 --> 43:07.626
the more you buy,
the more we talk.

43:07.710 --> 43:10.713
And the better you buy,
the better I talk.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.341
But if there's
no more buying...

43:16.802 --> 43:18.929
- I don't have enough
for a whole nother bottle.

43:19.596 --> 43:21.515
- Well, that's a shame.

43:22.224 --> 43:24.184
See you another time.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.666
Another drink.

44:32.544 --> 44:36.006
- So, Miyamoto-san...

44:38.675 --> 44:41.470
Tell me, how do reporters
and police work, huh?

44:46.725 --> 44:49.436
Here's what you need
to understand.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.980
There's no murder in Japan.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.399
Wait, what?

44:53.482 --> 44:54.525
How is that--

44:57.861 --> 44:58.737
- How is that a--

45:06.412 --> 45:07.788
- Huh?

45:12.876 --> 45:13.627
- Hmm?

45:34.690 --> 45:36.733
- Hi.
This is my friend Tatiana.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.694
- Hi. How are you?

45:49.246 --> 45:51.415
- I have to say,

45:51.498 --> 45:55.127
I find your dress
extraordinarily flattering.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.838
- Thank you.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.592
- What do you mean
there's no murder in Japan?

46:01.675 --> 46:03.093
That doesn't make any sense.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.263
- I forgot, your English
is not so good.

46:06.346 --> 46:09.558
There is no murder in Japan.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.768
- So then what was
that stabbing,

46:11.852 --> 46:12.769
that guy in the street?

46:12.853 --> 46:13.353
- Could be manslaughter.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.898
Could be accidental death.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.609
But the key is, unless you
have to deal with a witness,

46:18.692 --> 46:19.902
it's never a murder.

46:22.613 --> 46:23.989
- Since when
do you need a witness

46:24.072 --> 46:24.948
to tell you a murder
is a murder?

46:25.032 --> 46:28.160
- 'Cause you report it
and we can't solve it,

46:28.243 --> 46:29.536
our clearance rate goes down.

46:29.620 --> 46:32.164
- How does that get me
a story to write?

48:46.423 --> 48:50.218
- Two dead men, two logos.
The same logo.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.220
- You already have
a story to write.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.848
- But there's linkage.
This story is bigger.

48:54.931 --> 48:56.808
The guy who set himself
on fire in Kabukicho.

48:56.892 --> 48:58.644
- We covered that.
It's already in print.
