00:02.092 --> 00:03.725
What's going on in your lives today?

00:03.794 --> 00:04.794
Tell me everything.

00:04.828 --> 00:06.561
And don't skip the juicy parts.

00:06.630 --> 00:08.129
There better not be juicy parts.

00:08.198 --> 00:10.331
- I'm friends with a fawn.
- A what?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.599
My baby deer...

00:11.668 --> 00:13.835
I told you about her
this morning, remember?

00:13.904 --> 00:16.337
You kept saying,
"Uh-huh, honey. Uh-huh, honey."

00:16.406 --> 00:17.872
Uh-huh, honey.

00:17.941 --> 00:20.308
Oliver, Taylor,
what is going on in your lives?

00:20.377 --> 00:21.442
- Zero.
- Nada.

00:21.511 --> 00:24.165
All right, dummies, put your
phones down and keep them down.

00:24.696 --> 00:26.875
You know I can do a choke hold
from the driver's seat.

00:31.087 --> 00:32.709
Hi, guys!

00:32.812 --> 00:34.389
What is going on in your lives?

00:34.414 --> 00:35.714
- Same old.
- Nothing.

00:35.733 --> 00:38.607
It can't be "same old" if you've never
told me anything to begin with.

00:38.632 --> 00:40.161
<i>They used to tell me about everything,</i>

00:40.230 --> 00:43.398
<i>but just when they started growing
hair in weird places, they clammed up.</i>

00:43.467 --> 00:46.000
Somebody tell me something
about anything!

00:46.069 --> 00:48.603
- Deer are good swimmers.
- Oh, I didn't mean you, baby.

00:48.672 --> 00:49.938
You tell Mama everything...

00:50.006 --> 00:54.209
even wiping details
nobody needs to know about.

00:54.277 --> 00:57.112

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:02.419 --> 01:05.019
I need to know
what's going on in their lives,

01:05.087 --> 01:06.521
otherwise I'll wake up one day,

01:06.590 --> 01:08.823
and my kid is the crystal meth
king of Westport.

01:08.892 --> 01:11.025
Oh, like Susie Penta's kid.

01:11.094 --> 01:13.762
What? Susan Penta's kid
was selling crystal meth?

01:13.830 --> 01:16.364
That actually happens here?
I was just saying stuff.

01:16.433 --> 01:18.833
Oh, I'd love it if my kid
became a meth dealer...

01:18.902 --> 01:21.236
do anything besides play "Minecraft."

01:21.304 --> 01:23.638
Get off the couch,
go outside, and sell meth.

01:23.707 --> 01:24.906
It's a beautiful day.

01:24.975 --> 01:26.808
Look, if you want to know
what your kids are up to,

01:26.877 --> 01:29.677
start running their texts
through your phone.

01:29.746 --> 01:32.180
- You both read your kids' texts?
- Absolutely.

01:32.249 --> 01:33.648
Reading them right now,
and my kids are having

01:33.717 --> 01:34.983
a cribbage tournament and want to know

01:35.051 --> 01:36.291
who's bringing the Mountain Dew.

01:36.353 --> 01:37.353
Nerds.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.454
Yeah, I'm raising nerds.

01:39.523 --> 01:42.123
Put that app on my phone.
Make it so, sensei.

01:42.192 --> 01:44.526
That wasn't an Asian thing.
That was a "teach me" thing.

01:44.594 --> 01:46.528
If I would have bowed like this,

01:46.596 --> 01:48.730
it would have been an Asian thing.

01:48.799 --> 01:50.465
I just made it an Asian thing.

01:54.938 --> 01:57.505
So, kids, how was your day?

01:57.574 --> 02:00.942
I named my deer Bambi,
then thought, "I can do better."

02:01.011 --> 02:02.610
Excellent share.

02:02.679 --> 02:03.945
Moving on. Oliver?

02:04.014 --> 02:05.380
- Ehh.
- Not an answer.

02:05.448 --> 02:08.183
Now I'm gonna get specific.
Let's talk Alice McCarthy.

02:08.251 --> 02:09.251
- What?
- Yeah.

02:09.286 --> 02:10.451
What's the latest on you and her?

02:10.520 --> 02:12.387
There's no latest. There's no nothing.

02:12.455 --> 02:14.122
Should we invite her over
for dinner sometime?

02:14.191 --> 02:16.257
Are you crazy?!

02:16.326 --> 02:17.692
I'm trying to help you out.

02:17.761 --> 02:19.427
You're the kind of guy
who needs to hang around a lot,

02:19.496 --> 02:22.297
wear girls down, and then when they're
at their weakest, pounce.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.465
It works.

02:24.534 --> 02:29.871
"Ooh, Alice, let me hold your hand
with my gross, sweaty hand."

02:29.940 --> 02:31.239
It's not my fault.

02:31.308 --> 02:33.141
I inherited Dad's hyperactive glands.

02:33.210 --> 02:34.709
We run hot and wet.

02:34.778 --> 02:37.712
You know what really could seal
the deal with you and Alice?

02:37.781 --> 02:40.582
Ice-cream date,
back seat of the minivan...

02:40.650 --> 02:43.651
I'm up front setting you up
for jokes to make you look good.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.187
I'm having a physical reaction
to this scenario.

02:46.256 --> 02:47.422
You're gonna give me hives.

02:47.490 --> 02:50.258
Hives are on your mom.
I'm about sweat and eczema.

02:50.327 --> 02:52.527
- So, Taylor...
- Huh?

02:52.596 --> 02:55.930
Why did Sophie tell Natalie
that you're acting like Madison?

02:55.999 --> 02:58.132
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

02:58.201 --> 03:00.468
No, I didn't. I don't tell you anything.

03:00.537 --> 03:03.404
Oh, my God. I knew this would happen.

03:03.473 --> 03:05.206
She's getting our texts on her phone.

03:05.275 --> 03:07.375
Your mother would never violate
your privacy like that.

03:07.444 --> 03:09.544
Oh, but I would.

03:09.613 --> 03:10.945
Of course she would.

03:11.014 --> 03:12.547
I can't be an involved parent
if they don't involve me.

03:12.616 --> 03:13.982
I am your mother.

03:14.050 --> 03:15.283
I'm gonna be all up in your stuff

03:15.352 --> 03:18.233
so I can share my wisdom and keep you
both on the straight and narrow.

03:18.288 --> 03:19.687
That's not fair!

03:19.756 --> 03:22.824
What's not fair is that your brains
aren't fully formed until you're 21,

03:22.893 --> 03:24.659
and you're my responsibility until then.

03:24.728 --> 03:26.694
Nobody told me that
when I got into this.

03:31.268 --> 03:34.168
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

03:34.237 --> 03:35.803
I can trust you with a secret, right?

03:35.872 --> 03:37.805
I mean, you being
the cool parent and all.

03:37.874 --> 03:40.482
Yeah. I didn't realize... Yeah.

03:40.608 --> 03:42.977
Okay, well, I've been taking
cotillion classes.

03:43.096 --> 03:45.396
So you're learning good manners
and etiquette covertly.

03:45.465 --> 03:46.764
It's a weird secret.

03:46.833 --> 03:49.467
I'm using it strictly
for networking purposes.

03:49.536 --> 03:52.603
Your oldest friends are the ones
that lie to the S.E.C. for you.

03:52.672 --> 03:54.906
My friends and I used
to ride bikes, skip stones.

03:54.975 --> 03:56.507
One time, we threw
a watermelon off a roof...

03:56.576 --> 03:57.508
made a big mess.

03:57.577 --> 04:00.678
Cute. So here's the deal...

04:00.747 --> 04:02.246
There's a formal dance
that's part of it,

04:02.315 --> 04:03.548
and I'm going to need a tux.

04:03.616 --> 04:05.383
That's really more
of your mom's department.

04:05.408 --> 04:06.546
Well, it's going to have to be yours.

04:06.571 --> 04:08.504
- I'd rather not involve Mom.
- Why?

04:08.529 --> 04:11.205
If dinner wasn't enough, need I
remind you about the cafÃ© incident?

04:11.274 --> 04:13.074
Oliver, there's Alice McCarthy.

04:13.143 --> 04:15.443
She's so cute! Go say hi.

04:15.512 --> 04:16.778
Mom, no.

04:16.846 --> 04:19.012
Let's send her a cake pop
to get her attention.

04:21.151 --> 04:23.017
Ooh, she's looking.

04:23.086 --> 04:25.586
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.322
- Not good.
- No.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.958
All she needs is to find out
parents can come to cotillion.

04:30.026 --> 04:32.260
It's gonna be flying cake pops
for everyone.

04:32.329 --> 04:35.129
I just need someone
who gets it on a guy level.

04:35.198 --> 04:36.965
- I'm a guy. I get it.
- I know.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.873
So you won't tell her
about any of this, right?

04:38.902 --> 04:41.736
Your mom and I don't keep secrets
from each other... not anymore.

04:41.805 --> 04:43.371
See this scar here?

04:43.440 --> 04:46.040
This was a surprise party
for her that went awry.

04:46.109 --> 04:47.508
Okay.

04:47.577 --> 04:48.643
I just thought this could have been

04:48.712 --> 04:50.945
a defining bonding moment between us,

04:51.014 --> 04:52.947
one we could look back on
and laugh about

04:53.016 --> 04:56.150
when we're sharing a beer
after my college graduation,

04:56.219 --> 04:59.587
you and me, two guys, elbows on the bar.

04:59.656 --> 05:02.490
I do want that.

05:02.559 --> 05:05.026
- But keeping a secret from your mom...
- Come on.

05:05.095 --> 05:07.495
Just between us... bros.

05:09.933 --> 05:11.332
Sounds good, bro.

05:15.739 --> 05:17.305
Hey, honey.

05:17.374 --> 05:20.108
She hasn't sent a single text
to her friends all day.

05:20.176 --> 05:21.876
Taylor's gone dark on me, Greg...

05:21.945 --> 05:23.211
"Zero Dark Thirty."

05:23.279 --> 05:24.639
Is that what that movie was about?

05:24.681 --> 05:26.214
- I didn't see it.
- It's no big deal.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.548
I haven't texted anybody in weeks.

05:27.617 --> 05:29.550
Because your thumbs are
the size of Nebraska.

05:29.619 --> 05:31.319
And you have to put on
your reading glasses

05:31.388 --> 05:33.254
every time somebody sends you
an emoticon.

05:33.323 --> 05:35.390
They're really tiny, cruelly so.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.291
If I can't read her texts,

05:37.360 --> 05:38.960
then I've got to find another way in.

05:39.029 --> 05:41.295
Katie, you're stalking our kids
like you're hunting a wild animal.

05:41.364 --> 05:45.033
Now, me, I view raising children
a little more like fishing.

05:45.101 --> 05:47.168
You wait quietly in the boat
and let them come to you.

05:47.237 --> 05:49.237
What kind of nonsense parenting podcasts

05:49.305 --> 05:52.306
- have you been listening to?
- Hey, my technique gets results.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.776
In fact, "hanging back" is
how I got Oliver

05:54.844 --> 05:56.604
to beg to spend the day
with me after school.

05:56.646 --> 05:58.613
Oliver begged to hang out with you?

05:58.681 --> 05:59.580
Hell yeah.

05:59.649 --> 06:00.915
Why?

06:00.984 --> 06:02.417
I guess he wants
some father-son time, you know,

06:02.485 --> 06:05.389
to really let my
experience juices soak in.

06:05.413 --> 06:07.688
Mm-hmm. And what are
the two of you going to do?

06:07.757 --> 06:09.023
- Hang.
- Where?

06:09.092 --> 06:10.258
- Around.
- Specifically?

06:10.326 --> 06:11.326
Batting cages.

06:13.797 --> 06:15.663
Do I have something in my teeth?

06:15.732 --> 06:19.000
Nope. Sweaty lip.

06:19.069 --> 06:20.568
It's your tell.

06:20.637 --> 06:22.627
Mnh-mnh. You're hiding something.

06:22.695 --> 06:23.861
Spill it.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.273
I promised Oliver I wouldn't.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.475
It's just between us bros.

06:27.544 --> 06:28.544
Fine.

06:28.578 --> 06:29.978
Don't be hurt. Are you really hurt?

06:30.013 --> 06:31.279
What do you want from me?

06:31.347 --> 06:33.781
You're putting bros before hos.

06:33.850 --> 06:36.217
- It's not that big of a deal.
- But I need to mother, Greg.

06:36.286 --> 06:37.886
Without being a mother,
I am just a woman

06:37.921 --> 06:39.854
who put on 40 pounds for no reason.

06:40.957 --> 06:42.790
Fine.

06:42.859 --> 06:44.926
He's been taking these cotillion
classes, and there's a formal dance.

06:44.994 --> 06:47.295
And he needs a tux, and he wants
me to help him and not tell you.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.730
Why?

06:49.799 --> 06:52.567
Is he afraid that I'm
too involved in his life,

06:52.635 --> 06:54.168
that I'm going to embarrass him?

06:54.237 --> 06:55.970
Your words. And his.

06:56.039 --> 06:57.305
Well, too bad!

06:57.373 --> 06:59.774
I am going to go up there,
and I am going to tell him...

06:59.843 --> 07:01.876
No, no, no.
You're not gonna say anything.

07:01.945 --> 07:03.711
If he finds out
that I betrayed his trust,

07:03.780 --> 07:04.934
he'll never come to either of us

07:04.959 --> 07:06.034
with a problem again.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.349
We don't want him going
to the lonely baseball coach.

07:08.418 --> 07:11.219
Fine! He's yours.

07:11.287 --> 07:13.354
I'm gonna go handle the girls.
At least they smell good.

07:13.423 --> 07:15.590
Yeah, puberty's hitting Oliver hard.

07:15.658 --> 07:17.758
- Gross.
- Yeah.

07:21.409 --> 07:23.376
<i>So Oliver doesn't want me in his life.</i>

07:23.444 --> 07:25.076
<i>Does it hurt? Sure.</i>

07:25.163 --> 07:27.680
<i>But that's why I spent
nine months creating a backup.</i>

07:27.749 --> 07:29.515
What's going on in that head, lovey?

07:29.584 --> 07:30.650
Let Mama in.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.451
I'm just waiting for my deer.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.420
Come sit with me.

07:34.489 --> 07:37.156
Thank you. It's good to be wanted.

07:40.361 --> 07:42.361
Mama, did you know, in Connecticut,

07:42.430 --> 07:44.964
there are over 100,000 whitetail deer

07:45.033 --> 07:47.732
and that a mother deer
will leave a young fawn

07:47.794 --> 07:49.335
- in the days after it's born?
- <i>I thought I could do it.</i>

07:49.404 --> 07:50.386
<i>Can't do it.</i>

07:50.440 --> 07:52.071
And yet, it manages
to survive and eat on its...

07:52.140 --> 07:54.207
Okay, Taylor, you're up.

07:57.212 --> 07:59.712
So, how's it going?

07:59.781 --> 08:01.681
Fine, Mom, but I could use
a little privacy.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.749
No problem.

08:06.955 --> 08:09.055
We can have a little privacy together.

08:09.123 --> 08:11.324
I really don't feel like talking.

08:11.392 --> 08:13.826
I know you don't,
but I'm gonna need you to,

08:13.895 --> 08:16.028
or I'm gonna start texting as you.

08:16.097 --> 08:18.130
And it's gonna be all about your rash.

08:19.334 --> 08:20.633
It's on your butt.

08:20.702 --> 08:22.235
Why is this happening?

08:22.303 --> 08:23.870
Because you cut me out of your texts.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.138
- I'm not cutting you out.
- Your phone says otherwise.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.109
No one's texting me, okay?

08:30.178 --> 08:31.277
How come?

08:31.346 --> 08:32.378
'Cause out of the blue,

08:32.447 --> 08:33.679
Sophie decided not to talk to me,

08:33.748 --> 08:36.082
so, of course, now all of the other
girls are going along with it, too.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.818
God! Teenage girls suck.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.653
We're the worst.

08:40.722 --> 08:41.921
How about next time
I see Sophie's Mom...

08:41.990 --> 08:43.155
Do not do that.

08:43.224 --> 08:45.091
You'll ruin my life more
than it already is.

08:45.159 --> 08:46.626
You don't even know
what I was going to say.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.860
Watch.

08:47.929 --> 08:50.096
"Hey, Sophie's Mom"...

08:50.164 --> 08:52.265
I really don't have anything
beyond that.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.667
I kind of think best on my feet,
but you get the tone.

08:54.736 --> 08:55.736
Mom, please, no.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.703
I don't want you to fix anything.

08:57.772 --> 09:00.012
Then why did you tell me
if you didn't want me to fix it?

09:00.074 --> 09:01.874
- Because you forced me to.
- How about I say...

09:01.943 --> 09:03.075
Nope.

09:03.144 --> 09:04.877
Well, then, you know what?

09:04.946 --> 09:07.280
I'm gonna go bond hard with Anna-Kat.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.917
Oh. Hi, Mama.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.318
I'm leaving raisins for my deer.

09:12.387 --> 09:15.288
You know, deer's
favorite food is grapes.

09:15.356 --> 09:17.056
Still can't do it.

09:18.359 --> 09:21.227
- Hey, Dad.
- Wait for it... big finish.

09:21.296 --> 09:22.635
Pretty rad.

09:22.747 --> 09:25.281
Listen... We can skip the tux shop.

09:25.350 --> 09:26.482
I've been thinking about it

09:26.551 --> 09:28.451
and realized the dance
is gonna be totally lame.

09:28.519 --> 09:30.152
But I thought it was part
of the cotillion class.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.654
It's not like we're graded on it.

09:31.723 --> 09:32.723
It's voluntary.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.156
Yeah, but you seemed
so excited about it.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.159
Well, I thought it would be cool
if you and I hung out instead.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.128
You, me? On a Friday night?

09:39.197 --> 09:40.429
Just two dudes.

09:41.299 --> 09:43.499
Well, what are we dudes doing
tomorrow night?

09:43.568 --> 09:45.134
The question is, Dad,

09:45.203 --> 09:47.003
"What aren't we going to do
tomorrow night?"

09:47.071 --> 09:49.805
That is wildly non-specific.
I'm in for all of it.

09:56.781 --> 09:58.080
Hey, boys.

09:58.149 --> 09:59.589
Better not have ruined your appetite

09:59.617 --> 10:01.250
during your hangout this afternoon.

10:01.319 --> 10:04.420
Seems like this energy might be
more of a "you" problem.

10:09.928 --> 10:12.962
I don't know what you're making for
dinner, but it's gonna be flat.

10:13.031 --> 10:14.897
Did you enjoy your tux shopping?

10:14.966 --> 10:16.406
Actually, we didn't go tux shopping.

10:16.434 --> 10:17.767
- Why?
- He's blowing off the dance.

10:17.835 --> 10:19.035
- Why?
- Says it's gonna be lame.

10:19.103 --> 10:20.303
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:20.371 --> 10:21.337
He thought it would be more fun
to hang out with me.

10:21.406 --> 10:22.438
Well, that's a lie.

10:22.507 --> 10:24.140
- Jealous.
- Think about it, Greg.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.641
Two days ago, it was a big enough deal

10:25.710 --> 10:26.943
that he couldn't tell his mother.

10:27.011 --> 10:28.311
What changed?

10:28.379 --> 10:30.046
I didn't ask.

10:30.114 --> 10:31.480
You didn't ask.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.215
What's so wrong
about a 12-year-old boy wanting

10:33.284 --> 10:35.851
to do a little air-drumming
with his pops on a Friday night?

10:35.920 --> 10:37.119
Honey, listen to yourself.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.458
- He called me "bro."
- Oh, Greg.

10:42.527 --> 10:44.360
I got played, didn't I?

10:44.429 --> 10:45.761
Yeah.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.330
We need the truth
about why he doesn't want

10:47.398 --> 10:49.165
to go to the dance, and you know
how we're gonna find it?

10:49.233 --> 10:51.067
Not by having the fish come to us.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.569
No, we're gonna toss
a stick of dynamite in the water

10:53.638 --> 10:55.238
and let the answers float
to the surface.

10:56.541 --> 10:57.440
Come on.

11:02.513 --> 11:05.715
Why aren't you going
to your top-secret fancy dance?

11:05.783 --> 11:07.683
You ratted me out. Not cool, man.

11:08.953 --> 11:11.721
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, stay with me.

11:11.789 --> 11:13.255
- Why are you guys in here?
- You lied to me.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.523
I didn't lie.

11:14.592 --> 11:15.691
I might have withheld a few facts.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.527
A lie of omission is
the worst kind of lie.

11:18.596 --> 11:20.262
Actually, I think
the worst kind of lie is

11:20.331 --> 11:22.298
an outright lie that lands
an innocent man in prison.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.066
- What are you doing?
- I...

11:24.135 --> 11:26.869
You asked your father
to lie to me for you,

11:26.938 --> 11:30.006
and you're taking "how to behave like
a rich jerk" classes behind my back.

11:30.074 --> 11:31.874
- They're etiquette lessons.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:31.943 --> 11:34.043
Should I be yelling at you
with my pinky up?

11:34.112 --> 11:35.411
Give me answers.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.246
Why aren't you going to that dance?

11:37.315 --> 11:38.948
Like I told Dad, it's gonna be lame.

11:39.017 --> 11:41.083
Mm, is that the story
you're sticking to?

11:43.000 --> 11:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:50.128 --> 11:51.761
Sorry, buddy.

11:51.829 --> 11:54.430
You have it, too... the "Otto tell."

11:54.499 --> 11:55.637
When we betray others,

11:55.708 --> 11:57.207
- our bodies betray us.
- Mmhmm.

11:57.268 --> 11:58.501
Spill it.

11:58.569 --> 11:59.989
Now.

12:02.707 --> 12:04.240
Okay, I don't want to go anymore

12:04.308 --> 12:05.474
'cause I got partnered with someone

12:05.543 --> 12:07.410
- I don't want to dance with.
- Who?

12:07.478 --> 12:08.511
Some girl.

12:08.579 --> 12:10.446
I want a name.

12:10.515 --> 12:11.914
Kimmie Wu.

12:11.983 --> 12:13.916
- Kimmie Wu "Size Twenty-Two"?
- Yes.

12:13.985 --> 12:15.584
You got stuck with a fat girl

12:15.653 --> 12:17.653
and not one of Westport's
skinny future trophy wives,

12:17.722 --> 12:18.722
so you're backing out?

12:19.624 --> 12:21.257
Wow, Oliver. Really?

12:21.325 --> 12:23.059
You know, as the son of a larger lady,

12:23.127 --> 12:24.894
I would think
that you would be sensitive

12:24.962 --> 12:26.962
being partnered with
Kimmie Wu "Size Twenty-Two."

12:27.031 --> 12:28.397
You'd think, as a larger lady,

12:28.466 --> 12:31.033
you'd stop calling her
Kimmie Wu "Size Twenty-Two."

12:31.102 --> 12:33.135
Are those manners classes
teaching you to talk back

12:33.204 --> 12:34.904
to your Mom at a really stupid moment?

12:34.972 --> 12:37.139
Oliver, you are going
to that cotillion dance,

12:37.199 --> 12:38.237
and your mother and I are going, too.

12:38.283 --> 12:40.076
And we're going to make sure
that you dance with that girl

12:40.144 --> 12:43.546
because your father
and I are raising high-quality,

12:43.614 --> 12:45.979
non-sucky human beings.

12:46.049 --> 12:47.861
Human beings.

12:47.936 --> 12:49.369
I got your back.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.836
Two corsages... One for
Oliver's big, beautiful date,

12:57.891 --> 13:00.031
- and one for yours.
- Oh, I shouldn't have.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.866
Have fun tonight.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.970
Don't worry, honey.
Everything will work itself out.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.018
Your Dad's right.

13:06.043 --> 13:07.900
I know nobody texted you today,
but they will.

13:07.969 --> 13:09.601
You're still reading my texts?

13:09.670 --> 13:11.170
Oh, I'm so sorry
if I gave you the impression

13:11.238 --> 13:13.105
that I was going
to respect your privacy.

13:13.174 --> 13:14.373
That was wrong of me.

13:16.510 --> 13:18.310
Look at you... so handsome.

13:18.379 --> 13:19.611
We may not be raising them right,

13:19.680 --> 13:22.147
but we certainly make beautiful babies.

13:22.216 --> 13:23.682
Can we just get this over with?

13:23.751 --> 13:26.118
Do all your pouting in the car
because when we get there

13:26.187 --> 13:28.487
you are going to smile,
you are going to have fun,

13:28.556 --> 13:30.756
and you're going to dance
like nobody's watching...

13:30.955 --> 13:33.042
or exactly how they instructed you to.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.543
Call if you need anything.

13:34.612 --> 13:37.813
Sophie's mom is a part
of that whole cotillion crowd,

13:37.882 --> 13:40.616
so if you see her
please do not say anything.

13:40.685 --> 13:42.818
All my attention's off you
and on your brother.

13:42.887 --> 13:45.387
He pissed me off just a little
bit more than you today.

13:45.456 --> 13:46.456
Thanks, Oliver.

14:00.504 --> 14:04.039
Ohhh. I get it now.

14:04.108 --> 14:07.509
This is where they train to become them.

14:07.578 --> 14:09.945
- All right!
- Ohh!

14:11.649 --> 14:12.781
There's your girl.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.421
Here's your corsage.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.923
Now, where's that smile?

14:22.593 --> 14:24.360
Maybe no smile.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.328
A little advice...
Big girls don't like it

14:26.397 --> 14:29.098
when you rest your hands
on their midsection.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.801
Limit contact to just shoulders
and other bony joints.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.156
âª Love stinks âª

14:34.305 --> 14:36.578
âª Love stinks âª

14:36.899 --> 14:39.641
- âª Yeah, yeah âª
- âª Love stinks âª

14:39.710 --> 14:41.695
âª Love stinks âª

14:42.180 --> 14:44.580
- âª Yeah, yeah âª
- âª Love stinks âª

14:44.648 --> 14:45.914
Oliver, honey?

14:45.983 --> 14:48.150
Dad, I need to use the bathroom.

14:50.388 --> 14:52.688
Alice McCarthy's here with another boy.

14:52.757 --> 14:55.190
Ohh, poor Oliver.

14:55.259 --> 14:57.459
He probably hoped that
they'd get partnered together.

14:57.528 --> 15:00.496
And now he has to watch her
dance with that hot guy.

15:00.564 --> 15:02.297
He's 14 years old, Katie.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.199
Well, don't make it weird, Greg.

15:04.268 --> 15:06.435
- Should we go talk to him?
- What?

15:06.504 --> 15:07.536
No.

15:07.605 --> 15:10.072
I don't even know
what I would say to him.

15:10.141 --> 15:11.774
- I meant our son.
- Oh.

15:11.842 --> 15:12.941
No.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.309
I think you should.

15:14.378 --> 15:16.078
I'd really love
to dig my paws into this one,

15:16.147 --> 15:18.447
but I think it calls
for a gentler touch.

15:18.516 --> 15:20.082
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.255
Hey.

15:38.528 --> 15:40.067
Hey.

15:40.237 --> 15:41.670
Is everything all right in here?

15:43.774 --> 15:45.677
So, I saw Alice.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.443
Yeah?

15:47.511 --> 15:49.211
Is that why the dance was
gonna be so lame?

15:49.280 --> 15:51.043
Whatever. I don't care.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.282
Okay.

15:57.744 --> 15:58.957
I feel like an idiot.

15:58.982 --> 16:01.323
All last week, Alice's friends
kept coming up to me like,

16:01.392 --> 16:04.093
"Alice is gonna ask you to be
her partner at cotillion."

16:04.161 --> 16:06.528
Then, stupid Kurt Brockwell
comes back from having mono,

16:06.597 --> 16:08.497
and she asks him.

16:08.516 --> 16:11.083
And I get thrown in the
leftover pool with Kimmie Wu.

16:11.152 --> 16:13.252
- Can we just go home now?
- No.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.220
Look, this cotillion class was
about learning grace

16:15.289 --> 16:16.989
- and manners, right?
- Yeah.

16:17.058 --> 16:18.924
You go out there, and you show some.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.459
I promise you when you
look back at this moment,

16:20.528 --> 16:22.628
you're not gonna wish you'd
hidden in the bathroom longer

16:22.696 --> 16:24.096
or gone home early.

16:24.165 --> 16:26.432
You'll remember you acted like a man

16:26.500 --> 16:28.600
and you did the right thing.

16:28.669 --> 16:31.637
And when we go for a beer
at your graduation,

16:31.705 --> 16:34.807
we'll talk about this defining moment.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.675
I'm sorry I lied to you.

16:38.312 --> 16:42.247
Now let's get out there before
Kurt Brockwell is your stepdad.

16:53.561 --> 16:56.595
Look at our boy. Look at what we did.

17:01.352 --> 17:03.318
Eat your heart out, Alice McCarthy.

17:03.387 --> 17:06.422
No way her bony ass can
break it down like Kimmie Wu do.

17:06.490 --> 17:07.756
It's impossible not to rhyme.

17:10.728 --> 17:12.261
There's Sophie's Mom.

17:13.931 --> 17:15.664
You got to fix things
for one kid tonight.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.165
I'm gonna go fix things for the other.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.268
Didn't Taylor explicitly say not to?

17:19.336 --> 17:21.170
Greg, we can't listen to our children.

17:21.238 --> 17:22.337
They're children.

17:27.545 --> 17:29.144
Hi, Sophie's mom.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.712
I'm Taylor's mom.

17:30.781 --> 17:33.982
Seems like our girls aren't getting
along very well these days.

17:34.051 --> 17:36.351
- Girls this age, right?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.421
But in this case, it's more your girl.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.256
You have a problem with my girl?

17:41.325 --> 17:43.892
I have a problem with the problem
your girl has with my girl.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.794
Well, maybe you should mind
your own business

17:45.863 --> 17:47.596
and let them work it out for themselves.

17:47.665 --> 17:48.877
And now I have a problem with you.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.667
You're about to be a part of
something called making a scene.

17:59.985 --> 18:03.045
- Hey, how was the dance?
- Humiliating, then fun,

18:03.114 --> 18:05.781
then, thanks to Mom, humiliating again.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.290
Things definitely took a weird turn.

18:07.351 --> 18:10.119
Mom slapped a drink
out of Sophie's mom's hand.

18:10.187 --> 18:11.987
Your mom pushed the boundaries
of proper etiquette.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.889
I'm sorry, honey. It did not go well.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.858
It turns out after, "Hi, Sophie's mom,"

18:15.926 --> 18:18.060
I didn't have much of a plan.

18:18.129 --> 18:19.695
Oh, I know.

18:19.763 --> 18:21.630
Sophie and I have been going back
and forth about it all night.

18:21.699 --> 18:24.333
There's video. You guys might go viral.

18:24.401 --> 18:25.834
You and Sophie are talking again?

18:25.903 --> 18:28.504
We totally bonded over
our mothers being lunatics.

18:28.572 --> 18:31.473
- Why aren't I getting those texts?
- We were talking on the phone.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.041
Can you record those conversations

18:33.110 --> 18:34.209
and send them to me?

18:34.278 --> 18:36.011
I'm just kidding. I'll record them.

18:37.581 --> 18:40.149
Oh.

18:40.217 --> 18:43.986
- Oliver just got a text from Alice.
- Hm.

18:46.390 --> 18:50.092
"Top hat, smiley face, sweaty hands"?

18:50.161 --> 18:52.469
- That's "clapping."
- Cruelly tiny.

18:52.494 --> 18:53.629
What does it mean?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.631
It means she thought
he looked good in his tux

18:55.699 --> 18:57.099
and that he's a nice guy,

18:57.168 --> 18:59.334
and the clapping is applause
for his dancing.

18:59.403 --> 19:00.702
It means that he has a shot

19:00.771 --> 19:02.671
against the most handsome man
in the world.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.706
Child, Katie... He's a child.

19:04.775 --> 19:06.141
You're making it weird again.

19:09.346 --> 19:11.680
So if one of the kids comes
to one of us with a secret,

19:11.749 --> 19:13.415
we won't keep it from each other.

19:13.484 --> 19:14.850
No, we'll betray our children

19:14.919 --> 19:16.418
but hide our deception from them.

19:16.487 --> 19:18.954
We're in uncharted territory...
the teenage years.

19:19.023 --> 19:21.690
We need to monitor their texts
and read their e-mails.

19:21.759 --> 19:23.992
And rifle through their drawers.
Don't forget about the rifling.

19:24.061 --> 19:26.195
Drawers, bags, pockets.

19:26.263 --> 19:27.703
I'll go to school and bust a locker.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.831
Our kids don't think
they need us, but they do.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.968
That's why we've got to know what's
going on in their lives at all times.

19:33.037 --> 19:35.671
Nothing happens under this roof
without us knowing.

20:07.946 --> 20:09.025
Ugh!

20:09.087 --> 20:11.524
I should pay more attention to that kid.

20:11.548 --> 20:13.048
