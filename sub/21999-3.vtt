to be honest with her,

09:24.229 --> 09:27.263
that you didn't see what was
required there was a good lie.

09:27.265 --> 09:28.998
Although, I'd bet the house

09:29.000 --> 09:31.067
you think there's no such thing
as a good lie.

09:39.744 --> 09:42.178
These 15 kids are my only witnesses,

09:42.180 --> 09:43.580
and all their stories synced.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.181
So, obviously, someone sat them down.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.416
Obviously, someone rehearsed them.

09:46.418 --> 09:47.851
So what do you suggest I do?

09:47.853 --> 09:50.053
I'd put so much pressure
on those college boys

09:50.055 --> 09:52.288
they'd turn back into preschoolers.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.390

turning on each other.

09:54.392 --> 09:55.725
And how do I do that?

09:55.727 --> 09:57.093
Well, here's a crazy idea.

09:57.095 --> 09:58.461

09:59.931 --> 10:01.898
Against all of them, all 15.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.299
Charge them with manslaughter.

10:03.301 --> 10:04.667
Make those boys sweat.

10:04.669 --> 10:05.935
Make their parents sweat.

10:05.937 --> 10:07.504
Make them hire expensive lawyers,

10:07.506 --> 10:08.805
and make them sweat, too.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.374
You want me to charge 15 kids
with manslaughter?

I won't be able to convict
one person, let alone 15.

10:18.817 --> 10:21.317
If we charge all of them,
someone will break

18:34.584 --> 18:36.985
Never did it again, though.

18:36.987 --> 18:39.554
Power of peer pressure.

18:40.144 --> 18:41.823
JUDGE: <i>Be seated.</i>

18:49.966 --> 18:52.133
A little gift from me to you.

18:52.135 --> 18:53.568
What the hell are you doing?

18:53.570 --> 18:56.869
I'm helping you find
a high-threshold jury.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.410
Do any of you belong to, uh, any groups,

19:02.412 --> 19:05.847
clubs, organizations?

19:07.617 --> 19:09.884
I sing in my church choir

19:09.886 --> 19:12.787
and I'm part of my neighborhood watch.

19:14.650 --> 19:15.916
MARISSA: Oh, she is

19:15.918 --> 19:17.284
a joiner, Bull.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.986
Also, she belongs to the PTA,

19:18.988 --> 19:20.654
and she's on the board
of her community center.

19:20.656 --> 19:22.189
A pox on her house.

19:22.191 --> 19:23.690
Move to strike, Your Honor.

19:23.692 --> 19:25.592
And what about you, sir?

19:25.594 --> 19:27.194
Do you participate in any organizations?

19:27.196 --> 19:28.762
I belong to the Rotary.

19:28.764 --> 19:30.364
MARISSA: The president
of his local chapter

19:30.366 --> 19:32.399
three years in a row.

19:32.401 --> 19:34.601
Move to strike, Your Honor.

19:36.205 --> 19:38.338
Sir, it says here

19:38.340 --> 19:41.074
you're an officer on your co-op board.

19:41.539 --> 19:43.410
- What's your title?
- Treasurer.

19:43.412 --> 19:45.712
Bull's-eye. Talk about a thankless job.

19:45.714 --> 19:47.014
People must hate him.

19:47.016 --> 19:49.216
But he doesn't care,
which means we love him.

19:49.218 --> 19:51.107
Marissa, talk to me.

19:51.109 --> 19:52.519
What do you need, Dr. Bull?

19:52.521 --> 19:54.206
Marissa's not there?

19:54.208 --> 19:55.822
Um, she had...

19:55.824 --> 19:57.641
- an emergency.
- (LAUGHING)

19:57.643 --> 19:58.926
Can I help you?

19:58.928 --> 20:00.794
- What kind of emergency?
- JUROR: By the way,

20:00.796 --> 20:02.396
your pen is leaking.

20:02.398 --> 20:03.864
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

20:03.866 --> 20:05.332
You don't say.

20:05.334 --> 20:08.767
Never mind. I don't need her.

20:08.769 --> 20:11.672
This juror's acceptable
to the prosecution, Your Honor.

20:16.478 --> 20:17.911
That was a very expensive shirt.

20:17.913 --> 20:20.881
That was a very expensive pen.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.051
Anyone feel like tapas?

20:24.920 --> 20:26.375
Gentlemen.

20:26.855 --> 20:29.256
Mr. Assistant District Attorney?

20:29.795 --> 20:31.391
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch break, gentlemen,

20:31.393 --> 20:33.126
but I was hoping to get a word.

20:33.128 --> 20:34.428
What's on your mind, Counselor?

20:34.430 --> 20:36.730
Well, I know you're not
gonna like this, but, uh,

20:36.732 --> 20:39.299
I believe that
what we're looking at here

20:39.301 --> 20:42.202
is a tragic accident.
Nothing more, nothing less.

20:42.204 --> 20:45.672
But to compound the felony
by destroying 15 young lives...

20:45.674 --> 20:47.908
it makes no sense.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.643
There's no physical evidence,
you got no eyewitnesses.

20:49.645 --> 20:50.911
BULL: Wait a second.

20:50.913 --> 20:53.213
None of that changes the fact
that someone died

20:53.215 --> 20:54.648
during the commission of a crime.

20:54.650 --> 20:57.284
Excuse me, Jury Consultant.

20:58.153 --> 20:59.453
What crime?

20:59.455 --> 21:01.221
Contributing to the delinquency
of a minor.

21:01.223 --> 21:03.624
Providing alcohol
to someone who is underage.

21:03.626 --> 21:06.126
And by the way, I'm a trial scientist.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.262
What I do is, I tell lawyers...

21:08.264 --> 21:10.197
the ones who are smart enough
to listen...

21:10.802 --> 21:12.933
what to do so they can win their cases.

21:12.935 --> 21:14.868
And they pay me very well for it.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.738
I'm guessing you and I are not
destined to work together.

21:18.386 --> 21:20.340
These boys, including the victim,

21:20.342 --> 21:22.242
were doing what college kids
have been doing

21:22.244 --> 21:23.910
for 100 years... drinking.

21:23.912 --> 21:26.413
You really want to send them
to prison for that?

21:26.415 --> 21:28.782
An 18-year-old boy died, Counselor.

21:28.784 --> 21:30.150
And a mother lost her child.

21:30.152 --> 21:31.418
Absolutely.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.247
It's a tragedy, but it's
a tragedy born of an accident.

21:34.249 --> 21:37.057
No one set out to murder this poor boy.

21:37.059 --> 21:39.026
My clients weren't even present
when it happened.

21:39.028 --> 21:40.627
So they say.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.429
I tell you what.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.499
I'll let 14 of them walk.

21:45.501 --> 21:47.367
Mr. Assistant District Attorney.

21:47.369 --> 21:50.751
I will... under one condition.

21:51.307 --> 21:53.974
I want the person responsible.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.144
The one who said,
“Let's get these pledges drunk”"

21:57.633 --> 21:59.279
The one who said,
“Let's take them for a swim.”

21:59.281 --> 22:02.683
I want that person to come forward

22:02.685 --> 22:04.618
and accept responsibility.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.455
There's no such person,
Mr. Assistant District Attorney.

22:09.812 --> 22:11.558
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

22:15.164 --> 22:16.697
BULL: <i>Well, this is a career first.</i>

22:17.319 --> 22:19.266
<i>We're about to start a trial,
and I have no case.</i>

22:19.268 --> 22:21.702
- We have a case.
- No, we don't.

22:22.158 --> 22:24.404
No. My idea didn't work.

22:24.785 --> 22:27.074
I was sure they'd crack
and somebody would come to us

22:27.076 --> 22:30.110
and tell us the truth, but... (SIGHS)

22:30.112 --> 22:33.347
they just offered to let us surrender.

22:38.420 --> 22:39.820
Look at that.

22:39.822 --> 22:41.388
Not one, “I'm sorry.”

22:41.390 --> 22:43.290
Not one, “He was my friend.”

22:43.292 --> 22:45.058
BENNY: They're all terrified,

22:45.060 --> 22:46.927
just not terrified enough
to break ranks.

22:46.929 --> 22:48.328
BULL: You know what?

22:48.330 --> 22:50.230
We're doing this backward.

22:50.232 --> 22:51.465
What are you talking about?

22:51.467 --> 22:53.767
I'm tired of waiting for them
to come to us.

22:53.769 --> 22:56.636
Let's pick one kid,
separate him from the pack,

22:56.638 --> 22:58.705
and dismiss the charges against him.

22:58.707 --> 23:00.107
What do you mean? Offer him immunity?

23:02.111 --> 23:04.811
Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.

23:04.813 --> 23:07.180
- We have to be smart about it, though.
- (WATER RUNNING)

23:07.182 --> 23:08.782
We have to pick the right guy.

23:08.784 --> 23:10.751
Not the guy we really think is guilty.

23:10.753 --> 23:12.586
We want to see him punished.

23:12.588 --> 23:15.222
We got to pick a guy we can squeeze,

23:15.224 --> 23:18.925
a guy we can put on the stand
and scare the crap out of.

23:18.927 --> 23:21.228
Make him understand,

23:21.230 --> 23:23.230
once we've immunized him,

23:23.232 --> 23:26.900
if he doesn't cooperate,
he'll be locked up for contempt.

23:26.902 --> 23:30.003
If he lies, he'll be
locked up for perjury.

23:32.207 --> 23:34.107
I know just the guy.

23:36.369 --> 23:39.575
All I'm trying to say is, if
you approach it mathematically,

23:39.626 --> 23:41.460
his roommate Carter
is the most vulnerable.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.961
I don't understand.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.863
What do you mean, “mathematically”?

23:44.865 --> 23:46.865
Well, other than lies of omission,

23:46.867 --> 23:48.600
the only lies everybody had tell

23:48.602 --> 23:50.502
were that Sam got out of the water

23:50.504 --> 23:53.238
and went back to the frat house
with them... two lies.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.940
Carter, on the other hand,

23:54.942 --> 23:57.042
had to go a lot further.
He had to say that he and Sam

23:57.044 --> 24:00.645
made it back to the room
together and they went to bed.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.848
And that therefore Sam must have snuck

24:02.850 --> 24:05.617
out of the house after
everybody was asleep,

24:05.619 --> 24:07.552
and died alone.

24:07.554 --> 24:09.287
Under a grant of immunity,
he must testify,

24:09.289 --> 24:11.790
and if he lies, he is subject
to ten years in prison.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.392
Remember, the point of all this
is to get him to tell us

24:14.394 --> 24:15.527
what really happened that night.

24:15.529 --> 24:17.529
You have got to use his testimony

24:17.531 --> 24:19.164
against him like a club,

24:19.166 --> 24:20.799
and beat him with it,

24:20.801 --> 24:23.445
until he tells us what we need to know.

24:25.614 --> 24:28.039
I know what I need to do.

24:29.785 --> 24:32.677
Well, if you know what to do,
then our job here is done.

24:41.054 --> 24:42.320
Marissa.

24:42.322 --> 24:43.716
Uh, did you call me?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.191
When do I get to meet him?

24:46.193 --> 24:47.559
Meet who?

24:47.561 --> 24:49.261
Mr. Irresponsible.

24:49.263 --> 24:50.929
Let's just see if it lasts the weekend

24:50.931 --> 24:52.564
before we plan the wedding.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.533
(CHUCKLES)

24:54.535 --> 24:56.868
You know how important you are to me.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.204
I think so.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.207
And you can call me anytime.

25:02.693 --> 25:04.809
Day or night with anything.

25:04.811 --> 25:06.244
That is sweet.

25:06.989 --> 25:08.113
I'm fine, Bull.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.549
In fact, I'm better than fine.

25:11.035 --> 25:12.584
I'm happy.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.520
I'm happy you're happy.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.255
Go get some sleep.

25:22.462 --> 25:24.162
RICHMOND: <i>You're here on
a grant of immunity.</i>

25:24.590 --> 25:26.398
Um, yes, sir.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.466
That means, so as long
as you tell the truth,

25:29.194 --> 25:32.337
anything you say here,
we can't use it against you.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.573
That's what my lawyer said.

25:35.476 --> 25:37.208
RICHMOND: You and Sam were roommates.

25:37.210 --> 25:38.559
Would you say you were friends?

25:38.599 --> 25:39.665
Well, uh,

25:39.667 --> 25:42.387
we just met six weeks ago,

25:42.389 --> 25:44.014
but, yes.

25:44.016 --> 25:45.704
W-We liked each other.

25:45.706 --> 25:46.839
RICHMOND: On this particular night,

25:46.841 --> 25:48.781
there was a pledge party.

25:49.656 --> 25:52.611
I think you told the detective
it was a celebration.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.348
Was there alcohol at the celebration?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.117
Yes.

25:58.119 --> 25:59.625
Did you drink?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.188
Yes.

26:02.190 --> 26:04.356
Even though, here in New York State,

26:04.358 --> 26:05.658
you're under the legal drinking age.

26:05.660 --> 26:06.826
DANIELS: Your Honor.

26:06.828 --> 26:08.294
We're prepared to stipulate

26:08.296 --> 26:09.862
that there was underage drinking

26:09.864 --> 26:11.630
at the celebration.

26:11.632 --> 26:13.165
So stipulated.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.401
Did Sam drink?

26:15.403 --> 26:17.236
Yes, I-I saw him drink.

26:17.238 --> 26:18.804
Any idea how much?

26:18.806 --> 26:21.340
CARTER: I, uh, wasn't keeping track.

26:21.342 --> 26:22.842
(RICHMOND CLEARS THROAT)

26:22.844 --> 26:27.112
Coroner says Sam's blood alcohol
level was .43.

26:27.114 --> 26:28.813
Just to put it in perspective,

26:28.815 --> 26:30.815
symptoms in a typical human being

26:30.817 --> 26:34.186
with a blood alcohol level
between .3 and .4

26:34.188 --> 26:36.355
are complete unconsciousness,

26:36.357 --> 26:39.892
depressed or absent reflexes,
and impairment

26:39.894 --> 26:41.727
of circulation and respiration.

26:41.729 --> 26:43.996
Not to put too fine a point on it,

26:43.998 --> 26:45.731
but death has been known to occur

26:45.733 --> 26:49.802
at a blood alcohol level
of .37 or higher.

26:49.804 --> 26:53.339
And fatality is almost certain
for nearly all individuals

26:53.341 --> 26:55.241
at .45 or higher.

26:55.243 --> 26:56.742
DANIELS: Objection, Your Honor.

26:57.819 --> 26:59.745
Is counsel gonna ask a question?

26:59.747 --> 27:02.848
Sustained. Ask a question,
Mr. Abernathy.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.717
Happy to, Your Honor.

27:04.719 --> 27:06.318
So based on these findings,

27:06.320 --> 27:09.622
knowing that your roommate... friend...

27:09.624 --> 27:12.491
was almost certainly at the
very edge of consciousness,

27:12.493 --> 27:14.593
perhaps even death's door,

27:14.595 --> 27:16.376
is it still your testimony

27:16.378 --> 27:18.343
that he got out of the water on his own,

27:18.345 --> 27:20.532
traveled three quarters of a mile back

27:20.534 --> 27:22.167
to the fraternity house in the dark,

27:22.169 --> 27:25.404
climbed stairs to the second
floor and went to bed?

27:27.671 --> 27:29.441
Yes, sir.

27:29.443 --> 27:31.677
That is my testimony.

27:31.679 --> 27:33.474
RICHMOND: To the room you shared.

27:33.476 --> 27:34.845
Right beside each other.

27:35.616 --> 27:37.182
Yes, sir.

27:37.184 --> 27:39.141
Did he get undressed?

27:39.987 --> 27:42.421
We were already in our underwear.

27:42.423 --> 27:44.056
Did he brush his teeth?

27:46.127 --> 27:48.961
- I-I don't honestly remember.
- RICHMOND: But you are swearing

27:48.963 --> 27:50.863
under oath that the two of you

27:50.865 --> 27:52.164
returned to your room that night

27:52.166 --> 27:53.999
safe and sound, and that anything

27:54.001 --> 27:55.601
that happened to him
happened after that.

27:56.116 --> 27:57.536
Yes, sir.

28:05.112 --> 28:09.148
Son, do you know the
punishment for perjury?

28:09.671 --> 28:11.215
It's ten years.

28:11.646 --> 28:14.180
Ten years in prison
for lying to the court.

28:14.622 --> 28:15.754
I'm not lying.

28:15.756 --> 28:17.856
That's ten years per each lie, actually.

28:17.858 --> 28:19.425
So you'll be, what,

28:19.427 --> 28:21.760
29 when you get out? Or 39 or 49.

28:21.762 --> 28:23.362
DANIELS: Objection, Your Honor.

28:23.364 --> 28:25.464
We understand the concept of lying.

28:25.466 --> 28:28.300
We understand ten years,
and we all know how to count.

28:28.302 --> 28:30.302
I'm not lying.

28:31.193 --> 28:32.671
RICHMOND: What if I told you

28:32.673 --> 28:35.240
that I have security video
that shows 16 of you

28:35.242 --> 28:37.543
leaving the house for the celebration,

28:37.545 --> 28:39.511
but only 15 of you coming back?

28:40.369 --> 28:42.314
Would you be inclined
to change your story?

28:48.656 --> 28:50.656
(EXHALES)

28:50.658 --> 28:52.881
All that drinking...

28:54.091 --> 28:56.176
He needed to use the bathroom.

28:56.464 --> 28:58.464
He went in the side door.

28:58.466 --> 29:00.055
It's closer.

29:01.181 --> 29:02.968
No camera there.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.737
Is that your sworn testimony?

29:05.060 --> 29:07.039
(SIGHS) It is.

29:11.345 --> 29:13.527
Nothing further at this moment,
Your Honor.

29:14.215 --> 29:16.882
DANIELS: Defense has no
questions for this witness,

29:16.884 --> 29:18.751
- Your Honor.
- JUDGE: If counsel

29:18.753 --> 29:20.152
for both sides could approach the bench.

29:20.154 --> 29:21.687
What's Marissa saying?

29:21.689 --> 29:23.355
We created a lot of doubt,

29:23.357 --> 29:25.724
but not a lot of certainty
and people don't convict people

29:25.726 --> 29:27.626
based solely on doubt.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.195
RICHMOND: The judge would like
to see us in her chambers.

29:30.197 --> 29:33.499
She's threatening to dismiss the case.

29:33.501 --> 29:35.567
(EXHALES): Ooh.

29:37.853 --> 29:40.166
I've got 14 defendants in my courtroom.

29:40.606 --> 29:43.540
14 defendants, 12 jurors,
20-some parents,

29:43.542 --> 29:45.842
enough lawyers to hold a convention.

29:45.844 --> 29:48.796
But not one name on the witness list

29:48.798 --> 29:51.048
that promises to provide an iota of fact

29:51.050 --> 29:52.983
that will lead us anywhere different

29:52.985 --> 29:54.943
from where we are right now.

29:54.945 --> 29:56.253
In my opinion, this has been

29:56.255 --> 29:58.221
a colossal waste of time and resources.

29:58.223 --> 30:01.168
But, Your Honor,
that boy was obviously lying.

30:01.170 --> 30:02.992
That's a supposition, Your Honor.

30:02.994 --> 30:03.894
JUDGE: One we have neither the time

30:03.896 --> 30:06.463
nor the authority to adjudicate.

30:06.913 --> 30:08.532
That would have been
for the jury to decide.

30:08.534 --> 30:09.800
Would have been?

30:09.802 --> 30:11.501
JUDGE: I'm going to
issue a directed verdict.

30:11.503 --> 30:13.770
Everyone innocent on all counts.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.272
Let the defendants,
the jurors, everyone,

30:15.274 --> 30:18.050
- go home.
- BULL: But there's one more witness.

30:18.052 --> 30:20.110
JUDGE: Excuse me?

30:20.112 --> 30:22.312
I'm asking a favor, Your Honor.

30:23.096 --> 30:26.049
Allow us one more witness,

30:26.051 --> 30:29.653
and I believe we can bring this
to some kind of just conclusion.

30:29.655 --> 30:31.488
And who is this mystery witness?

30:31.490 --> 30:33.490
The person for whom I took on this case.

30:34.024 --> 30:34.925
The victim's mother.

30:34.927 --> 30:36.193
DANIELS: Excuse me.

30:36.195 --> 30:38.295
She wasn't there when her son died.

30:38.297 --> 30:40.997
She's not a percipient witness.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.909
We're not here to provide
catharsis, Dr. Bull.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.737
We're here to find the truth
and I fail to see

30:46.739 --> 30:48.372
how this is going to get us there.

30:48.374 --> 30:51.174
That's why I called it a favor,
Your Honor.

30:51.176 --> 30:54.578
You promised me you would
get me the truth.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.380
That's what I'm trying to do.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.117
They don't want to hear from me.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.018
They already know
everything I'm gonna say.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.487
Don't be so sure.

31:03.489 --> 31:06.857
You remember what you said
to me the first time we met?

31:07.349 --> 31:10.961
I told you I believed there were
people present when Sam died.

31:10.963 --> 31:12.996
And you said just the thought of that

31:12.998 --> 31:14.631
was like a second death to you.

31:15.399 --> 31:17.467
The boys need to hear that.

31:17.469 --> 31:20.470
It just might shake
the truth out of them.

31:22.241 --> 31:24.574
(SIGHS)

31:24.576 --> 31:26.810
Okay.

31:29.448 --> 31:31.615
Tell me what to say.

31:32.249 --> 31:33.717
Uh, Sam was an only child.

31:33.719 --> 31:35.218
He had no father.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.222
He had no brothers, so, the idea

31:39.224 --> 31:41.291
of being in a fraternity...

31:41.293 --> 31:43.360
a house full of brothers and fathers...

31:43.362 --> 31:44.861
he was very excited.

31:44.863 --> 31:46.029
DANIELS: Objection.

31:46.869 --> 31:47.898
Relevance.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.350
Ask a question, Mr. Abernathy.

31:52.227 --> 31:53.370
The day you got the call

31:53.372 --> 31:55.639
informing you that they
had found Sam's body,

31:56.523 --> 31:57.874
what were your reactions?

31:57.876 --> 32:00.577
Again. Relevance.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.413
Overruled.

32:03.415 --> 32:04.881
Let the woman speak.

32:05.240 --> 32:09.085
Well, there were many things.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.255
First I thought it must be some mistake

32:12.789 --> 32:15.000
and then I realized it wasn't...

32:15.694 --> 32:17.419
that Sam was gone.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.839
Just... gone.

32:21.567 --> 32:24.267
And then I realized that no one

32:24.269 --> 32:27.404
could look me in the eye
and tell me what happened.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.141
That apparently, no one knew.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.643
And that...

32:33.852 --> 32:36.313
I was gonna have to live
the rest of my life

32:36.980 --> 32:39.783
knowing one day I had a child,
and then the next day I didn't,

32:39.785 --> 32:42.419
but I would never know why.

32:42.944 --> 32:44.488
And then?

32:44.896 --> 32:47.357
And then it-it started to seem like...

32:47.359 --> 32:49.159
maybe somebody did know.

32:49.161 --> 32:51.428
Like, maybe there actually

32:51.430 --> 32:53.930
had been people there.
Like, a lot of people.

32:54.706 --> 32:58.168
And so, I wondered who made the choices.

32:58.627 --> 33:00.237
I mean, did they all

33:00.239 --> 33:02.939
just say, “Let's...

33:02.941 --> 33:05.408
go and get the pledges drunk”?

33:05.410 --> 33:08.712
Did they all just decide, “Hey, let's

33:08.714 --> 33:10.447
throw him in the river,” even though

33:10.449 --> 33:12.315
they're so drunk
they can't see straight?

33:12.317 --> 33:14.267
And then I gue...

33:15.053 --> 33:18.555
I guess... when Sam drowned...

33:20.292 --> 33:24.528
...did they all... decide,

33:25.487 --> 33:29.466
“Let's just not... call anybody.

33:29.908 --> 33:33.436
“Let's... go home.

33:34.454 --> 33:36.673
Let's just get some sleep”?

33:36.675 --> 33:39.309
DANIELS: Objection, Your Honor.

33:39.311 --> 33:40.744
I don't mean any disrespect,

33:40.746 --> 33:42.679
but I would be derelict in my duties

33:42.681 --> 33:44.748
if I did not object
to all this testimony

33:44.750 --> 33:46.550
based on relevance.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.119
Sustained.

33:49.803 --> 33:51.179
You're right.

33:52.224 --> 33:55.525
The jury will please disregard
everything they just heard.

33:55.527 --> 33:59.396
Right. Just go ahead and unhear that.

33:59.398 --> 34:01.898
JUDGE: Let's take a one hour recess,

34:01.900 --> 34:03.867
and counsel and I will
meet in my chambers

34:03.869 --> 34:05.168
to determine next steps.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.841
Earth to Marissa. Talk to me.

34:13.118 --> 34:16.012
Uh, well, the jurors were clearly moved.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.414

34:17.416 --> 34:18.748
Yeah, not quite.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.521
What's your next move?

Well, I'm probably gonna
do what most great men do

34:26.592 --> 34:28.358
when confronted with
a situation like this.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.659
Yeah. What's that?

34:29.661 --> 34:31.565
- Lie.
- Excuse me?

34:31.568 --> 34:32.929
I'll tell you all about it tonight

34:32.931 --> 34:34.531

Oh, and do me a favor.
20 minutes from now,

34:36.802 --> 34:38.201
will you please text Benny?

34:38.203 --> 34:40.103
- Uh, text Benny what?
- BULL: Doesn't matter.

34:40.105 --> 34:41.670
Just text him.

34:41.672 --> 34:44.139
Come on. Let's find Richmond Abernathy

34:44.141 --> 34:47.476
and see if we can convince him
to tell a couple of good lies,

34:47.478 --> 34:49.713
or at the very least, let us tell them

35:11.903 --> 35:13.603
This is nonsense.

based on a bunch of stares.

to allow their sons to testify

for me to hear those voice mails?

I'm an officer of the court
for the State of New York.

36:05.855 --> 36:07.941
Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

36:09.109 --> 36:10.226
Fine.

36:23.141 --> 36:25.141
15 years? Really?

36:25.143 --> 36:26.543
That's the sentence for manslaughter.

36:26.545 --> 36:28.244
That's the maximum.
No one gets the maximum.

36:29.514 --> 36:31.548
- courtroom.
- And that's before I indict you

36:31.550 --> 36:33.083
for obstruction of justice.

36:33.085 --> 36:34.651
That's good for another,
well, ten years.

36:34.653 --> 36:38.188
No. No, I'm-I'm not going
to prison for 25 years.

36:38.190 --> 36:39.756
Then let me help you.

36:39.758 --> 36:42.392
Agree to testify, and let that jury

36:42.394 --> 36:45.128
and that grieving mother know
what really happened that night.

36:46.187 --> 36:47.630
And then I will go to the judge,

36:47.632 --> 36:50.366
and I will use every bit
of influence I have

36:50.368 --> 36:51.968
to get her to go easy on you.

You just said Judge Hanlon
doesn't go easy on anyone.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.840
This is a business of favors,

I guess it's time to collect.

37:02.247 --> 37:03.913
What do you say?

37:04.549 --> 37:07.751
When I was a kid, my grandpa
would talk about World War II.

37:08.620 --> 37:11.421
But my dad and my older brothers...

37:12.589 --> 37:16.192
they'd talk about Hell Night,
about pledging,

37:17.218 --> 37:19.480
about how surviving that ordeal
made you a man,

37:19.482 --> 37:20.800
and introduced you to the people

37:20.802 --> 37:23.199
that would stay your friends
for the rest of your life.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.938
We all really liked Sam.

37:29.939 --> 37:32.242
That's why we asked him to be one of us.

37:32.901 --> 37:35.145
Nobody expected him to die.

37:35.737 --> 37:37.280
Who bought the alcohol?

37:37.282 --> 37:39.048
I did.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.651
Uh, the fraternity, but we used my I.D.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.920
And who ordered the defendants to drink?

37:44.245 --> 37:46.189
Me, but, I mean, we all did.

37:46.191 --> 37:48.191
It-It's kind of what you do.

37:48.917 --> 37:50.877
And who marched him down to the dock?

37:52.545 --> 37:54.197
That was me.

37:54.199 --> 37:56.199
I had the megaphone,

37:56.633 --> 37:59.469
and I was the one who pushed Sam
into the water.

38:01.096 --> 38:02.839
RICHMOND: And how long
did you keep them there?

38:03.723 --> 38:06.276
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

38:06.278 --> 38:08.845
Uh, we were drinking and shouting

38:08.847 --> 38:12.315
and having a great time, and then,

38:12.317 --> 38:15.018
Carter... he was treading water...

38:15.777 --> 38:19.114
started to say he couldn't
see Sam anymore, so...

38:20.990 --> 38:22.792
we started calling his name,

38:22.794 --> 38:26.462
uh, diving into the water
to try and find him, but...

38:26.464 --> 38:28.431
you couldn't see anything. It...

38:28.433 --> 38:29.732
MAN: <i>Sam!</i>

- It was black...
<i>- (ECHOING SHOUTS)</i>

38:31.736 --> 38:34.504
...so we just kept calling his name.

38:34.506 --> 38:37.407
Sam!

38:37.409 --> 38:39.676
Sam! Sam! Sam!

38:43.114 --> 38:46.808
And then, it kind of got quiet.
(SNIFFLES)

38:47.085 --> 38:49.285
We stopped calling his name.

38:50.103 --> 38:51.721
I-I guess we just realized

38:51.723 --> 38:53.823
that he wasn't there.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.592
And then,

38:55.594 --> 38:59.028
I said, um... I said this thing.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.199
I said... (SNIFFLES)

39:03.201 --> 39:06.169
“Well, maybe he just went back
to the house.”

39:08.206 --> 39:10.440
(SNIFFLING)

39:10.442 --> 39:12.675
I don't know where it came from,

39:13.334 --> 39:15.078
and I wish I had never said it.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.412
(SNIFFLES)

39:16.963 --> 39:19.148
It was just kind of...

39:19.757 --> 39:22.352
You could tell that... (CLEARS THROAT)

39:22.354 --> 39:26.356
The second they heard it, it was
what everyone wanted to hear.

39:26.931 --> 39:27.991
(SNIFFLES)

39:27.993 --> 39:32.595
We were drunk and stupid, and we didn't

39:32.597 --> 39:34.964
even think to call the police.

39:37.525 --> 39:39.369
Nobody said a word on the walk home,

39:39.371 --> 39:42.138
but I think we all realized that
there was a really good chance

39:42.140 --> 39:45.041
that our lives were gonna be
very different now.

39:47.869 --> 39:49.479
And what happened
when you got back home,

39:49.481 --> 39:50.947
and he wasn't there?

39:51.289 --> 39:53.349
Didn't anyone suggest
calling the authorities?

39:53.666 --> 39:55.551
Everybody was really drunk

39:55.553 --> 39:56.961
and really scared.

39:59.505 --> 40:00.857
Everyone just...

40:01.216 --> 40:02.859
went to their rooms and
either passed out or prayed

40:02.861 --> 40:05.128
that he'd show up the next
morning, and when he didn't...

40:05.130 --> 40:06.729
(SNIFFLES)

40:06.731 --> 40:08.689
...we made a promise to each other

40:09.510 --> 40:11.901
that we would not talk
about what had happened.

40:11.903 --> 40:13.269
Not to our lawyers.

40:15.104 --> 40:16.706
(VOICE BREAKING):
Not even to our parents.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.974
(SNIFFLES)

40:17.976 --> 40:20.143
And whose idea was that?

40:21.736 --> 40:23.746
That was me.

40:26.284 --> 40:28.051
(BREATH QUIVERING)

40:28.053 --> 40:30.253
I'm truly sorry.

JUDGE: You've been convicted
of manslaughter

40:39.097 --> 40:41.431
in a sad and senseless death.

40:41.923 --> 40:44.901
A young man full of life
and promise is gone.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.370
And you had the power to stop it.

40:47.929 --> 40:50.039
But instead, you chose to indulge

40:50.041 --> 40:52.208
and encourage yourself and others

40:52.210 --> 40:54.978
in reckless and wanton behavior.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.280
I'm taking into account that

40:57.282 --> 40:59.636
you admitted to your role
in the incident

40:59.638 --> 41:01.684
and took responsibility for the effect

41:01.686 --> 41:03.736
of your behavior on others.

41:04.320 --> 41:08.198
And I will note that Dr. Bull,
a member of the opposing team,

41:08.552 --> 41:13.262
has spoken up on your behalf,
which is a rare occurrence.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.599
I'm not one to reward bad behavior,

41:18.001 --> 41:21.004
but in this case,
I'm going to make an exception.

41:21.006 --> 41:24.841
I hereby sentence you to serve
two years in state prison.

Not so fast.

41:37.050 --> 41:38.988
Sit down, please.

41:41.526 --> 41:44.660
The rest of you bare a certain
degree of culpability, as well.

41:45.278 --> 41:47.030
I'm sentencing each of you
