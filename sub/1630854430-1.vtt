<i>MTV ♪</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
This is USP Canaan.

00:12.146 --> 00:15.449
The federal prison
in Northern Pennsylvania.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.819
Definitely not a great choice
for a destination wedding.

00:22.423 --> 00:26.860
I subsisted in hellholes
like this for the last 25 years,

00:26.994 --> 00:30.431
and to keep what's left
of my brain from deteriorating,

00:30.564 --> 00:34.635
I read some very good literature
and wrote some very bad poems

00:34.768 --> 00:38.906
and tried to avoid getting
shanked for a second time.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.745
I remember when I was 17,
my father asked

00:44.878 --> 00:46.480
what I wanted to be.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.583
If I'd like
to be a barber like him.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.120
I laughed in his face.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.089
I wanted to be
a successful gangster.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.126
In retrospect,
I ask myself

00:58.259 --> 01:00.261
if what I chose
for an occupation

01:00.394 --> 01:03.531
was worth 25 years
of my life.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.966
The answer is no.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.735
Not 25 seconds.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.904
But those are bygone times,

01:11.038 --> 01:13.474
water under the bridge.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.176
I married this life,

01:15.309 --> 01:18.579
and after keeping my mouth shut
for all these years,

01:18.712 --> 01:22.283
I'm gonna see
if it married me back.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.130
- What about Scores?
- What?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.466
There's a party, right?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.735
Long Island.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.537
What?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.707
Long Island.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.510
Why?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.545
They gave me an address.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.168
Whose house is this?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.371
They didn't say.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.393
Supposed to wait here.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.436
They're ready for you.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.155
Gang's all here.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.858
There he is.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.394
Nice place you got here.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.597
How you doin', Chickie?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.198
Uncle Dwight.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.335
- Remember Vince?
- I do.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.073
- Have a seat.
- At the head of the table?

05:06.206 --> 05:08.008
That ain't the head,
that's the ass.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.344
Witty.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.213
Nico, Mario,
you guys gotta stand behind me?

05:13.347 --> 05:14.815
We're watching the door,
buddy, that's all.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.650
Well, you can watch
from anywhere

05:16.784 --> 05:18.619
- like that corner over there.
- What can they do,

05:18.752 --> 05:19.953
someone comes
through the doorway

05:20.087 --> 05:21.922
the fuck over there, Dwight?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.358
You expecting company, Glenny?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
What's wrong with you?

05:26.093 --> 05:28.529
Nothing, I just don't like
guys standing behind me.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.197
Easy, buddy,
we're just watching the door.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.765
Don't stand behind
my fuckin' back.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.734
- Just give him some space.
- Where I've been,

05:33.867 --> 05:37.405
- it's not a good idea.
- <i>Ashpet,</i> relax.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.540
- Sit down...
- Not exactly

05:39.673 --> 05:41.675
the welcome
I was expecting.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.577
Business first.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
How is business?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.582
It's tough.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.256
Am I supposed to be talking
to him or to you?

05:56.390 --> 05:59.159
Chickie's my underboss now.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.595
Vince is one of my capos.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.965
Lot of changes.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.400
Twenty-five years.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.868
I was a kid
when you went away.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.903
I got news for you,
you're still a kid,

06:10.037 --> 06:11.739
so enjoy it.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.142
Like I was saying,
things are tough.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.777
Not like when you were around.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.612
No, it was easy
when I was around.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.581
- Just a little bit.
- Listen to my son.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.616
Look-look-look, I don't know
what you're expecting,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.518
okay,
now that you're back,

06:24.652 --> 06:26.754
but we can't
just rewind the clock.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.589
I'll tell you
what I'm expecting,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.758
that way you'll know.
I'm expecting after doing

06:30.891 --> 06:33.727
25 years,
to save your father's ass,

06:33.861 --> 06:35.863
for a murder,
to save your ass,

06:35.996 --> 06:38.131
whacking a guy,
who I actually liked,

06:38.265 --> 06:39.733
who didn't deserve it,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.870
I'm expecting some form
of adequate compensation.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.606
What do you think, we're not
gonna take care of you?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.140
Are you?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.109
Yes.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.711
Tulsa.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.788
- What the fuck is Tulsa?
- It's a city in Oklahoma.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.756
I know it's a city in Oklahoma,
I can read a map.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.391
What the fuck are you
talking about?

07:04.525 --> 07:05.693
I want you to go there.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.695
Plant a flag, get it set up.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.330
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.299
Dwight, I've been there,
the horse races,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.702
Springboard Mile,
it's wide fuckin' open.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.204
It's the future.
There's nobody doing nothing.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.773
You can earn like crazy.
Do whatever the fuck you want.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.609
But I'd be doing it
in Oklahoma.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.777
There's nothing
left for you here.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.148
I'm sorry.
But time just doesn't stop

07:28.281 --> 07:30.017
because you fuckin' went away.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.828
Nothing left for me here.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.742
Hey.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.611
You remember my wife Marie?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.914
She divorced me
when I went aside,

08:01.048 --> 08:02.550
and my daughter Tina?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.752
I haven't talked to her
in 18 years.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.186
She hates me.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.790
I took an oath.
And I honored it.

08:09.923 --> 08:14.027
I kept my mouth shut
for 25 fuckin' years.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.531
And now all I got
to my name is a few bucks,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.800
my suit in mothballs,
this watch,

08:19.933 --> 08:22.770
and a fuckin' pinky ring
that you gave me.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.807
Now, you got the balls
to tell me that,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.475
after everything
I've been through,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.544
after everything I've lost,
after everything

08:30.678 --> 08:32.479
I've done for this family--
your family--

08:32.613 --> 08:34.514
fuck-- there's
nothing left for me?!

08:34.648 --> 08:37.551
Hey! You don't understand
how this fuckin' works.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.587
They told you
where the fuck to go.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.254
- That's it.
- I don't understand?

08:41.388 --> 08:42.723
Listen, I made my bones

08:42.856 --> 08:44.357
when you were
in fuckin' diapers.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.159
Well, now
you're wearing diapers.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.896
Back the fuck up!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.430
Are you outta
your fuckin' mind?!

08:50.564 --> 08:52.032
No, I'm not outta my mind.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.235
- This guy has no respect.
- He's a capo, Dwight.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.337
To you, Pete, not to me!

08:57.470 --> 08:59.607
This wasn't our deal.

09:01.308 --> 09:05.145
Jesus Christ, I came here
with some sense of honor.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.180
You talk about compensation?

09:07.314 --> 09:11.551
I'm giving you
a whole entire fuckin' city!

09:11.685 --> 09:15.055
You're giving me
fuckin' banishment.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.825
You kick up
five grand a week to start.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.492
Sure, why not?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.036
Tulsa.
Yeah, why not?

09:29.169 --> 09:32.039
Be nice to breathe
some fresh air.

- Actually, I'm more
endowed than that,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.700

10:32.833 --> 10:35.035
Relax, it's holy water,
it's holy water.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.705
You should gargle with it
with that mouth.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.573
These Church of God folks bless
the shit out of you,

10:40.708 --> 10:41.842
you're not careful.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.476
- Need a cab?
- Actually, I do.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.412
Let me get you
right here then.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.414
Name's Tyson,
welcome to Tulsa.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.883
- Where to, man?
- Hotel.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.184
Which one?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.987
One where no one will
break my balls.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.102
Why do they call this place
the Sooner State?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.038
Well, you got
the football team.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.806
- Mm-hmm.
- That's all Sooner history.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.674
You know, when people
first came here and shit.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.677
- Settlers.
- When was that?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.612
Back in the day,
I guess, I don't know.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.083
You're not curious?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.918
Not really.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.487
You know what'd be nice?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.189
If someone
invented a device

11:29.322 --> 11:30.724
where you could look
this shit up,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.659
that would really be great.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.427
You trippin', man?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.663
The iPhone, man, you...

11:39.666 --> 11:41.134
Oh, you fuckin' with me,
man, you...

11:41.268 --> 11:42.970
...I can't look it up right now.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.571
I'm-- I'm driving right now.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.974
Yeah, all right,
forget it.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.279
Lot of churches
around here.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.147
It's the Bible Belt, my man.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.149
And you in the buckle.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.119
So is this a wedding?
A funeral?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.789
- Business.
- What kind of business?

12:01.922 --> 12:03.490
The "none of
your fuckin' business"

12:03.623 --> 12:05.225
kind of business.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.561
I like that. Gangster
gotta be a gangster, huh?

12:08.695 --> 12:10.030
What'd you call me?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.900
- Say what?
- You called me a gangster.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.435
I didn't call you no gangster,
I said a gangster gotta...

12:15.568 --> 12:18.405
- be a gangster.
- Wouldn't that make me
a gangster?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.307
Look, man, you obviously
ain't met no Black folks, or--

12:20.440 --> 12:22.442
I met more Black folks
than you can count.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.111
Well, then you would know,
you can call anybody

12:24.244 --> 12:26.379
a gangster,
it's like saying they cool.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.315
You think a gangster is cool?

12:31.218 --> 12:34.054
Aight, it's like-- it's like
calling a dude a player.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.290
Except I say gangster,
I ain't sayin' you in a gang.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.960
You know, you my gangster like
a motherfucker right now--

12:40.093 --> 12:41.728
You'd better stop
calling me that, pal.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.130
Hey, look, ain't nobody
gonna tell me what to say

12:43.263 --> 12:44.932
in my own cab,
you got that-- gangster?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.733
You know what, someone's
gonna slap some good grammar

12:46.867 --> 12:48.268
in your mouth,
and that's gonna be me--

12:48.401 --> 12:49.837
Hey, ain't nobody gonna
talk to me like that

12:49.970 --> 12:51.438
- in my own damn cab--
- Hey, hey!

12:51.571 --> 12:53.240
You want some gangster?
I'll give you gangster.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.242
Stop the car.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.112
What is that place?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.513
It's a dispensary.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.082
It's where they sell marijuana.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.184
So anybody can
just walk in there?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.786
Yeah, it's a store, man,
what you want?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.756
- Uh-huh, who runs it?
- Whoever owns it.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.925
Nah, I mean,
who runs this neighborhood?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.726
Like, what crew runs it?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.495
Ain't no crew
up in here, man.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
You're in the middle
of nowhere.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.167
No, I got that.
Why don't you pull over there?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.836
Well, wait a little bit
until I come out.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.273
This will compensate you
for your time.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.866
Excuse me, sir.
Let me see your medical ID.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.202
It's okay,
I'm just looking around.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.037
It's okay.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.239
- I'm not gonna buy anything.
- Yeah, that's cool, man.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.108
Thanks, appreciate it.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.445
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.080
Can I help you?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.316
Yeah, uh,
I just got into town.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.085
And I'm just looking around.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.288
And I'm wondering,
how does all this work?

14:15.422 --> 14:18.258
Oh, um... depends
on what you're looking for.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.527
- Mm.
- Um, we got gummies--

14:20.660 --> 14:22.762
- Mm-hmm.
- actual flower,

14:22.896 --> 14:25.832
CBD oil, creams,

14:25.966 --> 14:29.102
uh, strictly
for medicinal purposes.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.071
If you're just looking
to get high, let me know.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.441
- Take credit cards?
- It's cash only, sorry.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.144
Really? Oh.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.846
You only have one guard
and no cameras.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.549
Where I come from,
very risky.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.551
We don't get
much crime here.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.253
Oh, that's good.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
So, who owns this shithole?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.059
Uh, excuse me?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.662
I said...

14:55.795 --> 14:58.165
who owns this shithole?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.634
- Uh, Bodhi.
- Where's Bodhi?

15:01.768 --> 15:03.070
In his office?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.272
Are you asking me
or telling me?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.576
Go get Bodhi.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.445
I-- I can't leave
the desk, man.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.050
Hey...

15:17.184 --> 15:19.752
put down the pork rinds
and get Bodhi.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.689
- What?
- You heard me, Jumbo.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.924
Get Bodhi.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.429
Listen, asshole,
take a hike.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.832
Come on, man,
time to go.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.441
You got a tire iron?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.510
Yeah, yeah,
I can go to the back and--

15:43.643 --> 15:44.911
Forget it.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.047
- Hey, yo, that's my juice.
- Ssh.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.516
Anybody got the time?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.484
All right, listen,
mister, I told you to--

15:51.618 --> 15:53.320
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

15:54.621 --> 15:56.423
Okay, what the fuck, Clint.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.925
You must be Bodhi.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.329
Yeah, who the--
who are you?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.597
- What's your name again?
- Clint.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.899
Clint.
Stand next to Clint.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.270
Is this a robbery? Fuck.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.306
Fred?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.075
Oh, my God,
is he dead?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.876
Nah, he's taking a break.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.346
Excuse me, sweetheart.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.981
Are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.984
I'm way too fucking high
for this, can--

16:25.118 --> 16:27.554
can I just wait it out
over here, please?

16:27.687 --> 16:30.323
Put your phone on the counter
and take a seat.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.360
I need to see your books.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.827
My books?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.629
Your books,
your ledgers, files,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.031
whatever you got.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.900
Are you...
from the government?

16:41.034 --> 16:43.403
I just knocked
your guard out, cold,

16:43.536 --> 16:45.538
and you think I'm a CPA?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.541
So, you're not
with the government.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.843
Let's take a walk.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.115
Look at these numbers.
You're making a fortune.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.986
So, where are you
keeping this money?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.155
It's in the bank.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.893
I swear, it's in the bank.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.262
Only states
legalized this stuff.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.931
You put that money
in the bank,

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
and the Feds will
have it by morning.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.768
Even you're smart enough
to know that.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.004
I'm not lying to you.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.273
Let me paint you a picture.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.475
You see my shoe?

17:22.609 --> 17:23.743
Yeah.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.378
Now, I'm gonna take the heel

17:25.512 --> 17:27.714
of my right shoe,
which is very sharp,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.116
and stomp it--

17:29.249 --> 17:31.384
very hard

17:31.518 --> 17:33.453
on the top
of your left foot,

17:33.586 --> 17:36.389
breaking at least
three or four metatarsals.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.227
It's excruciating.
I don't wanna do it.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.995
So, let me ask you again.

17:43.963 --> 17:47.334
Could it be in the desk?
Could it be in the microwave?

17:47.467 --> 17:51.838
Or could the safe be
behind that...

17:51.971 --> 17:54.040
silly poster?

18:02.215 --> 18:04.317
You don't need
to put yourself through this.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.620
I wanna be your friend,
I want you to be my friend.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.322
I don't wanna hurt your feet.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.625
Just open
the safe, please.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.696
My God.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.398
How much you got there?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.200
Half a million.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.269
This is how it's gonna work.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.704
I'm gonna take
20% a week.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.041
Hey, we all got bosses,
even I answer to somebody.

18:29.176 --> 18:32.479
But in exchange,
I'll protect you from the gangs.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.913
What gangs?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.449
- And the law.
- This is legal.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.685
And if you attacked by locusts,
I'll spray 'em.

18:38.818 --> 18:43.022
Please, don't make me have
to be an asshole about this.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.292
Okay? I protect you.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.826
And you pay me a commission.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.162
Capisce?

18:57.204 --> 18:58.638
That's really
all you're gonna take?

18:58.771 --> 19:01.274
What did I just say?
We're partners.

19:01.408 --> 19:05.077
You make the money,
and I make sure you keep it.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.547
Do we have a deal?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.683
- Do I have a choice?
- Absolutely not.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.090
What happened to my bottle?

19:18.225 --> 19:19.592
- I was thirsty.
- You don't want it.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.661
It's got blood all over it.
Open the door.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.765
When you're not driving a cab,
what kind of car do you drive?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.867
Pssh, the repo man took it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.669
Here's some money.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.172
I want you
to buy me this car.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.245
- A Navigator?
- Yep, new one, black,

19:38.378 --> 19:40.647
and you drive for me now.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.282
What?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.618
Two grand a week.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.490
My gangster.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.959
Let's go to the hotel.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.362
Stop with that gangster shit.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.446
Okay, Tyson,
I need you here

20:13.580 --> 20:15.882
tomorrow morning
at 10:00 AM.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.585
Wear a collared shirt,
00 AM.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.459
Can I help you, Mister...

21:32.592 --> 21:33.993
Manfredi.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.695
Can you call me a cab?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.497
Oh, we don't really get

21:37.630 --> 21:39.265
a lot of cabs around here,

21:39.399 --> 21:41.768
- but you can call an Uber.
- Oh, yeah, what's the number?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.870
There's no number,
you just use the app

21:44.003 --> 21:46.839
- on your phone.
- Oh.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.241
Do you have an app
on your phone?

21:49.376 --> 21:50.910
Of course.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.381
Ms. McNamara,
call me an Uber.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.955

- It's all yours.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.958
Good evening.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.761
- How you doing?
- Good.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.863
What'll it be?

22:43.996 --> 22:46.032
Well, I assume
you don't have chianti.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.267
You assume correctly.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.670
- Okay.
- What you need's a bourbon.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.472
Yeah, and why is that?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.774
Well, because I was really
hoping you'd buy me one.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.877
You'll have to forgive
my friend here,

22:58.010 --> 23:00.046
mister,
he's a goddamn mooch.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.516
Hey, the answer is
always no until you ask.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.152
I'll have a bourbon for me
and my two pals here.

23:06.285 --> 23:09.088
- See?
- Bourbon it is.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.158
Is it all right to eat here?

23:13.292 --> 23:15.294
Best seat
in the house.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.763
And what do you suggest?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.631
You find better ribs
in Tulsa--

23:18.765 --> 23:20.332
you let me know.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
Ah, then ribs it is.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.040
So, where's home, friend?

23:28.174 --> 23:30.142
I'm gonna give you
two guesses,

23:30.276 --> 23:32.344
but I bet
you'll get it in one.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.816
- New York.
- You're good, very good.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.818
I couldn't help notice,
are those

23:38.951 --> 23:40.520
lizard boots
you're wearing?

23:40.653 --> 23:43.122
Yes, sir, they are.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.525
Made in Texas
just like me.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.728
Check these out.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.663
Made in Italy,
like my old man.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.333
Well, how about that?
We both like dinosaurs.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.135
There you go.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.638

I'm no expert,
but I'm pretty sure

24:18.290 --> 24:19.959
that's not
a Lincoln Navigator.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.661
It's my mom's.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.229
And?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.632
Had to go home and get it
after the car dealership.

24:25.765 --> 24:29.068
- Where's the Navigator?
- He wouldn't sell me one.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.370
- You show him the cash?
- What happened was

24:31.504 --> 24:34.140
he called me a crack dealer,
threatened to call the police.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.315
Take me there.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.167
Good morning.
How can I help you?

25:06.839 --> 25:10.276
No one's gonna know,
what are you worried about?

25:12.111 --> 25:13.780
Uh-huh.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.216
Listen, uh,
let me call you back.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.120
Donnie Shore.
What can I do you for?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.122
Perry Cuomo,
nice to meet you.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.125
It seems we have
a slight misunderstanding.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.327
See, my associate
was in earlier,

25:28.460 --> 25:31.864
trying to buy that Navigator
that you got downstairs,

25:31.998 --> 25:33.800
but you wouldn't
sell it to him.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.935
Oh, boy, I am so sorry.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.570
Why, Donnie?

25:37.704 --> 25:40.006
Well, you know, it was
a total misunderstanding.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.841
Like you said yourself.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.243
The truth is,
he's a good kid.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.179
Probably never had
a day of trouble in his life.

25:47.313 --> 25:50.316
You see the problem is,
you see a young Black guy

25:50.449 --> 25:52.384
with a mountain of money--
right away, you say,

25:52.518 --> 25:54.120
hey, he's gotta be
a drug dealer.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.988
- Oh.
- But I walk in,

25:56.122 --> 25:57.924
in a nice suit...

25:58.057 --> 26:00.159
and you're
not afraid anymore.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.461
You see,
the irony is...

26:03.462 --> 26:05.297
he's afraid
of the wrong thing.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.036
- I'm not following.
- Well, follow this.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.006
Aah-- I'm calling the police.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
Hey, let me get
the phone for ya.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.146
Here's the deal, Donnie.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.581
You're gonna sell
my friend over here

26:22.715 --> 26:24.150
the black Navigator

26:24.283 --> 26:26.753
for $50,000 cash.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.155
- Loaded.
- Loaded.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.992
- Deal?
- Okay.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.995
This wasn't necessary.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.875
This is crazy.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.177
I forgot how good
ice cream is.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.245
They didn't give you
ice cream in jail?

26:53.379 --> 26:54.947
No.

26:55.081 --> 26:58.017
Usually it was tiramisu.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.653
That's a joke, right?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.358
Eh...

27:06.492 --> 27:07.894
Enough.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.697
I'm gonna go wash up,
I'll meet you back at the car,

27:10.830 --> 27:13.065
we're gonna go see Bodhi.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.624
Hey.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.428
How you doin', Fred?

27:42.561 --> 27:44.897
- I've been better.
- Try the Advil.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.565
Thanks.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.702
What's with this puss?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.904
That's how you
welcome customers?

27:52.038 --> 27:53.973
Are you a customer now?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.744
You know, you're
in the service business.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.812
You gotta be welcoming.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.984
- This is Tyson, by the way.
- What's up?

28:06.352 --> 28:07.419
I got something for you.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.355
Security camera.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.624
And before you say
anything, yes,

28:12.759 --> 28:14.861
I get the irony.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.633
So, how much did
we make today?

28:21.768 --> 28:24.470
Um, <i>we</i> made

28:24.603 --> 28:26.906
a little
over five grand so far.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.776
You're a sarcastic
little prick, aren't you?

28:31.443 --> 28:34.013
So, tell me, where do
you get your weed from?

28:34.146 --> 28:36.015
There's a greenhouse
and a 40-acre farm

28:36.148 --> 28:37.817
a couple hours north of here.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.519
That's where I buy.
They're licensed.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.022
- Who are "they"?
- A guy named Jimmy.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.557
Is he a front for somebody?
'Cause a lot of these farms

28:45.691 --> 28:48.594
are fronts for cartels,
you gotta know your risks.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.363
There was no risk
until you came along.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.599
You know, the Feds can
waltz in here right now,

28:53.732 --> 28:56.936
take every dollar you got,
and there's not a goddamn thing

28:57.069 --> 28:59.038
you can do about it.

28:59.171 --> 29:02.074
- What do you suggest I do?
- Clean it.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.610
You mean,
uh, launder it?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.914
I mean like
George fuckin' Jefferson.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.183
The TV show,
before your time?

29:11.317 --> 29:13.585
Had a lot of dry cleaners.
Not important.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.255
What's important is
you get that money outta here

29:16.388 --> 29:19.258
- as fast as you can.
- Okay, isn't that illegal?

29:19.391 --> 29:21.928
You sell pot
for Christ's sake.

29:22.962 --> 29:26.298
And... where should I put it?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.035
Tanning salons.
Used to be big business.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.803
Now they're big losers.

29:30.937 --> 29:34.473
- Clubs, discos.
- A disco?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.008
Whatever you call 'em nowadays.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.845
I just don't wanna
get in trouble.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.013
There's more than
one kind of trouble, Bodhi,

29:41.147 --> 29:44.283
Especially when you have money
like that in the safe.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.153
Now, you listen
to what I'm saying.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.490
If you need me,
I'll be at the Western Plains.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.060
The Western Plains?

29:55.761 --> 29:58.831
- What?
- It's a dump.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.105
What's the best hotel in Tulsa?

30:06.238 --> 30:09.108
- The Mayo.
- So why am I not staying there?

30:09.241 --> 30:10.742
You said you wanted
to be in a place

30:10.877 --> 30:12.111
that wasn't gonna
bust your balls, right?

30:12.244 --> 30:15.347
So I put you
in the Western Plains.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.051
You can do your gang...
your illegal business stuff.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.888
Go get my stuff,
I'm gonna check into the Mayo,

30:22.021 --> 30:23.822
then I need you
to drop me off

30:23.956 --> 30:25.958
at a place called
the Bred-2-Buck.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.593
What in the hell is that?

30:27.726 --> 30:29.495
Cowboy bar,
what do I know?

30:29.628 --> 30:31.030
In the future,

30:31.163 --> 30:32.798
if anyone asks
what I do for a living,

30:32.932 --> 30:34.766
you tell 'em
I'm an industrialist.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.668
What does that even mean?

30:36.802 --> 30:40.439
My point exactly.
Nobody knows.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.479
How you holding in, Pops?

30:47.613 --> 30:48.948
Eh, I'm doin' all right.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.956
My dad.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.958
Don't trust
leaving him home alone,

30:59.091 --> 31:02.494
so I take him to work with me
so's I can babysit.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.732
I'm Mitch, by the way.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.600
Dwight.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.769
A <i>paisan</i> named Dwight, huh?

31:10.903 --> 31:12.871
Dwight David Manfredi.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.941
My parents are
proud immigrants

31:15.074 --> 31:17.009
that named me
after the greatest general

31:17.143 --> 31:18.644
of the 20th century.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.579
Mm.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.714
Let me ask you something.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.251
How long were you in the joint?

31:27.253 --> 31:29.688
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.890
Twenty-five years,

31:32.024 --> 31:34.660
last six in Canaan, you?

31:34.793 --> 31:36.595
Little over eight, Lompoc.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.931
Excuse me?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.134
Are you famous?

31:43.435 --> 31:44.370
I hope not.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.105
Are you sure?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.274
Oh, sweetheart,
if you have to ask

31:48.407 --> 31:51.510
if someone's famous,
they're not famous.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.881
Oh... can we take
a picture with you?

31:57.583 --> 32:00.752
I don't mean this in a bad way,
but I'd rather not.

32:00.886 --> 32:03.389
Well, you're no fun.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.558
Tell me about it.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.528
How long have you had
this joint?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.530
A little over five years.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.000
I was on the circuit.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.969
- Bull riding.
- Bull riding, really?

32:17.103 --> 32:20.906
Got busted up.
Addicted to pain pills.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.375
Ran into a little trouble.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.277
Then I started
flying around.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.746
Well, here's to clear skies.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.248
Hey.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.417
Why were you rude
to my friend?

32:34.220 --> 32:36.022
I wasn't being rude.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.290
I just don't like
having my picture taken.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.393
Why? Are you wanted
or something?

32:41.527 --> 32:42.995
Nobody wants me.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.197
You're not that bad.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.400
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.602
Well, you messed up,

32:50.736 --> 32:54.540
because they were gonna
invite you to the party.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.411
- What party?
- Karaoke Castle.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.713
Sounds exciting,
but I wouldn't really

33:01.847 --> 33:03.949
call that a party.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.951
What do you call a party?

33:06.085 --> 33:07.986

Just keep the pervs away

Hey, Black Suit.
Come dance with me.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.995
Tough guys don't dance.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.797
You don't take pictures,
you don't dance.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.499
What do you do?

35:00.632 --> 35:02.201
Well, if I wasn't
a gentleman,

35:02.334 --> 35:03.669
I just might tell you.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.337
Well, if I wasn't a lady,

35:05.471 --> 35:07.206
maybe I'd want you to.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.241
You're something.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.244
You live around here?

35:12.378 --> 35:14.045
Yeah, I'm out at the Mayo.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.015
You wanna show me
your minibar?

35:18.217 --> 35:20.118
Haven't you had
enough already?

35:21.387 --> 35:22.988
We'd better hurry up,
before I sober up

35:23.121 --> 35:25.157
and lose my nerve.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.429
You got a car?

35:30.562 --> 35:32.298
No, not with me.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.434
But we'll...
figure it out.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.215
Hey, can I wear your robe?

35:49.348 --> 35:50.682
Yeah, go ahead.

35:53.084 --> 35:55.221
Well.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.155
This was very fun.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.957
Yeah, it was great.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.360
Just a little rusty,
you know?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.295
It's been a while.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.664
Really?

36:05.797 --> 36:08.867
- You got a cigarette?
- Nah, I don't smoke.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.904
I wouldn't've pegged you
as the boy scout.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.340
Why not?

36:14.473 --> 36:16.642
The accent, the tattoos.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.745
Affinity for
very classy strip clubs.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.281
I'm new in town.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.749
Are you married?

36:23.882 --> 36:25.851
I was, a long time ago.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.721
- You?
- Middle of a divorce.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.124
You were actually
the deciding factor.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.093
How's that?

36:35.227 --> 36:38.364
Well, I figured if I could
actually go through with it,

36:38.497 --> 36:40.899
there was no turning back.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.101
I'm glad to be your Rubicon.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.937
- What's that?
- That's a river in Italy

36:46.071 --> 36:48.173
that Julius Caesar crossed,
you know, it's--

36:48.307 --> 36:51.343
the idiom is,
it's the point of no return.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.880
Hm.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.685
How old are you?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.887
Seriously.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.423
Why don't you just say,
hey, Dwight,

37:04.556 --> 37:07.493
where were you
when JFK got assassinated?

37:07.626 --> 37:10.862
All right,
where the fuck were you?

37:10.996 --> 37:13.432
I was a senior in high school.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.336
Seriously?

37:17.469 --> 37:20.238
That would make you, what...

37:21.640 --> 37:24.310
Seventy-five big ones.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.414
Oh, my God.

37:29.781 --> 37:33.084
Are you kidding me?
I mean... I...

37:33.218 --> 37:35.887
I would've said
you were a hard 55.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.223
Hard's the key word here,
isn't it?

37:39.358 --> 37:41.727
Oh, I'm sorry,
you know what,

37:41.860 --> 37:43.629
I'm gonna go.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.063
Is it the age gap?

37:45.196 --> 37:46.632
No, this is not an age gap.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.401
This is an age canyon.

37:49.535 --> 37:52.270
Are you hungry?
I could call room service.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.939
No, I'm good, thank you.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.807
I don't even know
your name.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.276
You know, probably better
to keep it that way.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.280
You know, normally
I would drive you home,

38:02.414 --> 38:05.083
but I can call you an Uber,
'cause I just got an app.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.753
I'm good--
thank you, seriously.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.688
Um, really...

38:09.821 --> 38:11.390
you know, I had...

38:12.358 --> 38:14.025
I had a good time.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.095
Maybe I'll see you around.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.699
It was nice meeting you.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.468
Bye.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.912
So, this is Tulsa.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.381
Nice enough place,

38:35.514 --> 38:37.449
but for me a prison, nonetheless.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.285
That's not a complaint,
it's just a fact.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.288
The result of a lifetime
of bad choices.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.125
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Eddie, it's Armand.

38:47.258 --> 38:48.827
<i>The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

38:48.960 --> 38:50.562
Listen to me.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.064
Is there
any fuckin' possibility

38:53.198 --> 38:55.266
I just saw
Dwight Manfredi in Tulsa?

38:55.401 --> 38:57.202
I guess
you could say I was banished.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.706
Exiled, sentenced to start
from scratch, and that's fine.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.074
I'll do it.
I'll rebuild.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.744
You want me to earn?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.413
I'll earn.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.115
I'll earn so much money
you'll choke on it.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.150
And in addition
to over half a million dollars

39:12.283 --> 39:14.285
of stolen ammo,
we're also tracking

39:14.420 --> 39:17.322
a shipment of stolen AR-15s,
which more than likely will go

39:17.456 --> 39:20.091
to the highest bidder
among the local militia groups.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.928
And finally...
our friends at the FBI

39:23.061 --> 39:24.630
have alerted us
to a new visitor.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.966
Not really our purview,
but a high-ranking mafia capo

39:28.099 --> 39:29.601
who was recently
released from prison

39:29.735 --> 39:31.970
has decided to grace Tulsa
with his presence.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.839
Dwight Manfredi...

39:33.972 --> 39:36.207
- Oh, fuck me.
- ...AKA Ike, or sometimes

39:36.341 --> 39:39.277
Cinque Stelle, which means
"five star" in Italian.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.179
At least two murders
to his credit,

39:41.312 --> 39:42.914
both in the '90s,
but we are not to assume

39:43.048 --> 39:44.816
he's some toothless tiger.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.285
Abandon me?
Ostracize me?

39:47.419 --> 39:50.489
Alienate me
from my friends and family?

39:50.622 --> 39:53.324
All the people I love?

39:53.459 --> 39:56.127
I'll survive.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.438
And here I am.
Bloodied but not beaten.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.507
Down but not out.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.909
And from this point on,

40:11.042 --> 40:13.479
this city
and everything in it

40:13.612 --> 40:16.114
belongs to me.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.739
- you'd open the door.
- Seriously?

40:40.872 --> 40:43.475
No, but it would've been nice.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.977
I need to talk
to your supplier.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.614
You got a last name, <i>wasicu?</i>

40:48.747 --> 40:51.016
- What does that mean?
- Non-Indian person

40:51.149 --> 40:53.819
- who steals the fat.
- That's a first.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.721
What does your family think
about you being here?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.723
That thing with Vince.
You gotta make this go away.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.891
Not your mob family.
Your real family.

41:00.025 --> 41:03.128
I haven't seen
my daughter in 18 years.

41:03.261 --> 41:06.464
There's nothing left for me
in New York.
