00:02.303 --> 00:04.238
(Mindy)
WHAT AN EXCITING YEAR IT'S BEEN

00:04.272 --> 00:06.107
FOR ROMANTIC LIAISONS
AND SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.476
FROM THE TALL AND WHITE
TO THE SHORT AND WHITE,

00:08.509 --> 00:10.644
I SAMPLED AN ECLECTIC RANGE
OF MEN.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.746
BUT IT WAS ALL FOR NAUGHT.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.515
SO WITH A HEAVY HEART,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.284
I'M TAKING
ALL OF MY CHERISHED MEMENTOS

00:16.317 --> 00:20.154
AND STUFF I'VE STOLEN FROM GUYS
AND I'M PUTTING THEM AWAY.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.122
AH.
SEE YOU, LOVE LIFE.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.156
ADIOS, DATING.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.092
I DON'T CARE ABOUT GUYS ANYMORE.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.126
WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.594
YOU, JENNY, MY DEAR.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.829
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
ARE YOU USING BIRTH CONTROL?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.664
NO WAY.
MY DAD WOULD FREAK.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.566
HE STILL THINKS
I'M TOO YOUNG TO DATE.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.368
WHEN HE HEARD MY DORM
WAS CO-ED,

00:34.402 --> 00:35.136
HE GAVE ME A GUN.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.271
WELL, THAT IS ACTUALLY
VERY SMART,

00:37.305 --> 00:38.672
BUT, JENNY, YOU AND I,

00:38.706 --> 00:41.275
AS YOUNG WOMEN
FRESHLY OUT OF ADOLESCENCE,

00:41.309 --> 00:43.211
WE CANNOT LET
THE GUYS IN OUR LIVES

00:43.244 --> 00:46.280
CONTROL OUR LIVES--
DADS, BOYFRIENDS,

00:46.314 --> 00:47.415
NUTRITIONISTS WHO SAY,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.183
"MINDY,
DON'T ONLY EAT STEAK."

00:49.217 --> 00:51.619
WELL, I HEARD THAT BIRTH CONTROL
MAKES YOU FAT AND CRANKY.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.753
SO DOES PREGNANCY.

00:52.786 --> 00:53.754
MORGAN!

00:53.787 --> 00:55.389
YES, MY QUEEN?

00:55.423 --> 00:56.657
OH, HI.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.326
HI.
CAN YOU PLEASE GET JENNY

00:58.359 --> 01:00.394
SOME FREE
BIRTH CONTROL SAMPLES?

01:00.428 --> 01:01.162
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.130
AND LET'S TEACH HER
THAT RHYME

01:02.163 --> 01:04.332
TO REMEMBER TO TAKE
THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.200
(both)
"WHEN I NEED TO TAKE THE PILL,

01:06.234 --> 01:08.269
I LOOK UPON THE WINDOWSILL."

01:08.302 --> 01:10.238
OH, MY GOD, I HAVEN'T
TAKEN MY BIRTH CONTROL

01:10.271 --> 01:12.140
IN, LIKE, TWO WEEKS.
WELL, LUCKILY FOR YOU,

01:12.173 --> 01:13.774
SOMEONE'S BEEN GRINDING IT UP
AND PUTTING IT IN YOUR COFFEE.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.376
THANK GOD.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.677
BYE.
A PLEASURE.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.512
GET SOMEONE TO GRIND UP
YOUR BIRTH CONTROL

01:18.546 --> 01:20.381
AND PUT IT
IN YOUR COFFEE.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.315
DON'T DEPEND ON
THAT RHYME.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.750
I WON'T.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.585
DO NOT PLAY IT FAST
AND LOOSE LIKE ME.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.786
OH, BOY.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.860
(Danny)
FARMERS MARKETS ARE THE WORST.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.228
THE EGGS ARE WEIRD.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.596
DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON THE HONEY STICKS.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.231
I DON'T KNOW WHY PETER SAID
YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.667
YOUR CRANKY OLD MAN CHARACTER
IS HILARIOUS.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.235
[laughs]

01:41.269 --> 01:42.370
WHAT?

01:42.403 --> 01:45.139
I GOT HIS HAT.
I GOT THE OLD MAN'S HAT.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.006
COME ON,
GIVE ME THAT HAT.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.508
THEY'RE PICKING ON
THAT POOR WIZARD.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.143
IS ANYONE GONNA
HELP HIM?

01:49.177 --> 01:51.879
GIVE ME YOUR UMBRELLA.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.348
OKAY, ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.916
GIVE THAT GUY
HIS HAT BACK NOW.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.819
OR WHAT,
MARY POPPINS?

01:58.852 --> 02:00.154
[laughs]

02:00.188 --> 02:01.422
OR I'M GONNA BE POPPIN'
YOU IN THE FACE

02:01.455 --> 02:04.425
WITH THIS PINK UMBRELLA.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.260
GIVE HIM THE HAT BACK NOW.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.701
GET LOST. SCRAM.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.236
TURN YOUR HAT AROUND.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.437
I DON'T CONDONE
ANY VIOLENCE.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.605
I'M SORRY.
I GOT A BAD TEMPER.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.507
I'M KIDDING.
THAT WAS EXHILARATING!

02:19.540 --> 02:20.641
[laughter]

02:20.674 --> 02:21.709
YES, THANK YOU,
YOUNG MAN.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.411
DON'T MENTION IT.
IT'S NEW YORK.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.479
WE TAKE CARE OF
OUR OWN, RIGHT?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.781
OH, SHULMAN
AND ASSOCIATES.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.950
I SENSE WE HAVE A DOCTOR
IN THE HOUSE.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.952
YEAH, I'M A DOCTOR.
MOM MUST BE PROUD.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.554
WHO KNOWS HOW TO
PLEASE THAT WOMAN?

02:33.587 --> 02:36.324
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.
YOU KNOW?

02:36.357 --> 02:39.293
UH, THIS IS MY STOP.
I GOTTA GO.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.361
YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY, RABBI.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.795
THANK YOU, DR. SHULMAN.

02:42.796 --> 02:43.797
RIGHT.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.935
I'M LOOKING FOR
A DR. MINDY LAHIRI.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.937
OH, SLOW DOWN,
TOUGH GUY.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.938
WHO'S ASKING?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.640
ME.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.275
SHE'S IN THAT OFFICE
OVER THERE.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.310
SHE DID IT.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.478
SUSAN ROBINSON?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.347
NO, I'M
BEVERLY SOMETHING.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.883
WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.387
MINDY LAHIRI?
UH, KNOCK MUCH?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.588
I'M GETTING STEAK
OUT OF MY TEETH.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.922
I'M DETECTIVE
CHARLIE LANG.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.258
I'M HERE BECAUSE

03:10.291 --> 03:11.725
YOU GAVE MY JENNY
BIRTH CONTROL.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.261
SHE'S A KID.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.562
SHE JUST LEARNED
HOW TO SWIM.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.297
OKAY, THAT'S ON ME,
LIVING IN THE CITY.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.431
BUT THE PILL--
THAT'S ON YOU.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.567
OFFICER, I'M AFRAID
I CANNOT DISCUSS THIS,

03:19.600 --> 03:22.836
BECAUSE OF PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY, I THINK.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.273
BUT IF I DID GIVE HER A
PRESCRIPTION FOR BIRTH CONTROL,

03:25.306 --> 03:27.341
IT WAS HER CHOICE,
BECAUSE SHE'S AN ADULT.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.942
OH, YEAH, WELL,
YOU JUST WATCH YOURSELF,

03:28.976 --> 03:30.711
YOU SEX-CRAZED QUACK--
I COULD GET YOU ON

03:30.744 --> 03:32.380
THE NO-FLY LIST LIKE THAT.
[snaps]

03:33.914 --> 03:36.784
JOKE'S ON YOU,
'CAUSE I'M ALREADY ON IT!

03:39.353 --> 03:40.321
(Mindy)
STOP!

03:40.354 --> 03:41.322
DIRTY COP!

03:41.355 --> 03:42.290
STOP! STOP!
[honk]

03:42.323 --> 03:44.325
STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!

03:44.358 --> 03:45.626
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.027
DO YOU WANT TO
GET YOURSELF KILLED?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.329
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF, SIR,

03:48.362 --> 03:49.997
COMING INTO MY OFFICE
AND YELLING AT ME

03:50.030 --> 03:51.832
ABOUT YOUR OUTDATED VIEW
ON BIRTH CONTROL?

03:51.865 --> 03:53.501
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
RICK SANTORUM?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.269
OBVIOUSLY NOT,
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT HOT.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.405
THE BALLS ON YOU!
DO YOU EVEN HAVE KIDS?

03:57.438 --> 03:58.672
HOW DARE YOU!

03:58.706 --> 04:00.408
DO I LOOK LIKE A WOMAN
WHO'S HAD KIDS?

04:00.441 --> 04:01.909
I HAVE THE HIPS
OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.344
NO, YOU LOOK LIKE
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

04:03.377 --> 04:04.278
WITH STEAK IN HER TEETH.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.313
THAT'S BECAUSE
I WOLFED DOWN

04:05.346 --> 04:06.480
A STEAK SANDWICH
AT LUNCH.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.615
AND THIS OUTFIT...

04:07.648 --> 04:09.049
WELL, EVEN I HAD
A COUPLE MISGIVINGS

04:09.082 --> 04:10.418
WHEN I WORE IT
IN THE MORNING,

04:10.451 --> 04:11.319
BUT IT'S COLORFUL.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.853
AND NOT THAT IT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE TO YOU,

04:12.886 --> 04:14.455
BUT I'M ONLY LOOKING OUT
FOR JENNY, OKAY?

04:14.488 --> 04:16.324
I DON'T WANT HER TO BECOME
ANOTHER PREGNANT TEEN.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.591
AND NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

04:17.625 --> 04:18.926
BUT I AM NOT
A SEX-CRAZED LUNATIC.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.329
I HAPPEN TO BE TAKING
A BREAK FROM MEN.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.997
I FOUND THAT IT WAS KIND OF
DISTRACTING ME IN A TIME--

04:24.031 --> 04:25.433
OKAY, YEAH, YEAH,
GOOD FOR YOU.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.867
YOU JUST LOST YOURSELF
A PATIENT

04:26.900 --> 04:27.868
AND GAINED A TICKET.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.837
"PUBLIC FEMALE HYSTERIA"?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.071
THEY NEVER TOOK IT
OFF THE BOOKS.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.072
[engine turns over]

04:32.105 --> 04:33.073
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.074
THIS IS--

04:34.107 --> 04:35.843
YEAH, YOU BETTER DRIVE OFF!

04:36.844 --> 04:38.346
EVERYONE SEE THIS?

04:38.379 --> 04:41.449
IT'S FOR WALKING WHILE BEING
A PERSON OF COLOR.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.085
(Danny)
RABBI, WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.620
YOU LEFT THAT TRAIN
SO QUICKLY,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.055
I TURNED AROUND,
AND YOU WERE GONE.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.590
IT WAS JUST
LIKE YOU WERE,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.758
I DON'T KNOW,
A BATMAN.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.860
OH, YOU KNOW,
PRAISE REALLY...

04:52.893 --> 04:54.595
IT JUST--
IT EMBARRASSES ME.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.397
I'M MORE OF THE STRONG,
SILENT TYPE.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.666
I DON'T LIKE TO FILL
JUST SILENCE, YOU KNOW,

04:58.699 --> 04:59.667
WITH TALK, TALK, TALK.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.768
YOU'RE HEROIC.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.703
BUT I AM HERE,
DR. SHULMAN,

05:02.736 --> 05:05.005
TO ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR SHABBOS DINNER.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.574
DR. SHULMAN?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.376
UH, NO, YOU--
OKAY, YOU THINK THAT I'M--

05:08.409 --> 05:09.610
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE NOT ORTHODOX.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.611
I GET IT.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.779
RABBI, I'M NOT EVEN--

05:11.812 --> 05:13.381
AS THE MOST PROMINENT RABBI
IN BROOKLYN,

05:13.414 --> 05:16.750
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN COME TO ME
FOR DOCTOR REFERRALS,

05:16.784 --> 05:21.054
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEND THEM
TO A NICE JEWISH BOY, SO...

05:21.088 --> 05:22.790
THOUSANDS?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.725
THAT'S A...

05:24.758 --> 05:26.727
THAT'S A...

05:26.760 --> 05:28.362
A MITZVAH?
[snaps]

05:28.396 --> 05:29.597
A MITZVAH.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.832
ALL RIGHT, I WILL SEE YOU
THEN AT DINNER.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.901
YOU WILL MEET MY WIFE,
MY DAUGHTERS.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.837
AND IF IT'S A GOOD FIT,
MAZEL TOV.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.807
DEFINITELY MAZEL TOV,
BIG TIME.

05:50.784 --> 05:51.919
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.389
YOU OKAY?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.857
[coin clattering]

05:56.890 --> 05:59.893
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO TOWN
ON THAT THUMBNAIL.

05:59.927 --> 06:00.794
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
MADE FUN OF

06:00.828 --> 06:02.430
MY TALKING DIGITAL WATCH.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.466
(watch)
THE TIME IS 0:00.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.834
I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SET THIS THING.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.035
OKAY.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.903
COME ON,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.472
THAT STUPID COP YELLED AT ME

06:11.505 --> 06:12.940
FOR GIVING HIS DAUGHTER
BIRTH CONTROL,

06:12.973 --> 06:14.742
LIKE BIRTH CONTROL
ENCOURAGES SEX.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.809
IT DOESN'T.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.411
YOU KNOW WHAT
ENCOURAGES SEX?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.112
ALCOHOL, HOTNESS...
BLACK MUSIC.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.781
OKAY, COME ON.
IT DOES!

06:20.814 --> 06:22.416
THAT'S WORKED UP,
EVEN FOR YOU.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.484
OKAY.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.785
HOW MANY HOURS OF ENERGY

06:24.818 --> 06:25.786
DID YOU DRINK?
NONE.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.488
I JUST--
I SWORE OFF ROMANCE,

06:27.521 --> 06:29.890
'CAUSE I WAS TIRED OF BEING
OBSESSED WITH GUY PROBLEMS.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
NO OFFENSE.
OKAY.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.794
AND SO NOW I THINK I'M JUST
CONSUMED WITH WORK PROBLEMS.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.062
MY CARDIOLOGIST SAYS
I'LL BE DEAD AT 50.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.097
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.632
NO GUYS.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.633
GIRLS?

06:39.667 --> 06:40.768
I WISH.
OH, MY GOD.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.736
HOW HOT WOULD ME
AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY BE

06:42.770 --> 06:43.837
ALL SNUGGLED UP
IN A LOG CABIN?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.573
YOU THINK YOU COULD PULL
KEIRA KNIGHTLEY?

06:45.606 --> 06:46.807
I COULD! IT'D BE LIKE
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.509
AND I CAN TAKE A BRA OFF
LIKE THAT.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.644
SO CAN I.
NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.680
THE HOOKS ARE SMALL.
TOOK YOU, LIKE,
20 MINUTES.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.815
YOU HAD ME BLINDFOLDED.
YOU GOT ALL, LIKE,
MAD AND SWEATY.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.816
YOU HAD TO TAKE A BREAK.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.017
[pager buzzes]

06:57.050 --> 06:58.886
NEVER HAD ANY
COMPLAINTS BEFORE.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.554
I AM COMPLAINING
TO YOU NOW.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.156
I GOT TO GO.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.827
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.896
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.532
[as Schwarzenegger]
I'LL BE BACK.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.666
OH, MY GOD!

07:12.700 --> 07:13.901
OKAY, SORRY.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.803
YOU'RE SO LAME!
RIGHT.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.137
OH, MY GOD.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.612
JENNY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:24.645 --> 07:25.913
HOW DID YOU FIND
MY APARTMENT?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.548
IT WASN'T, LIKE,
ON A STAR MAPS

07:27.581 --> 07:28.549
OR ANYTHING, WAS IT?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.750
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT

07:29.783 --> 07:31.485
WHAT YOU SAID,
LIKE, A LOT.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.654
YEAH, THAT RECYCLING
MAKES AMERICA LOOK POOR.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.822
THANK YOU!

07:34.855 --> 07:35.823
ABOUT TAKING CONTROL
OF MY LIFE BACK

07:35.856 --> 07:37.124
FROM GUYS, LIKE MY DAD.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.191
OH, YES, YES.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.627
YEAH, THAT WAS
A GOOD POINT TOO.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.728
SO CAN I STAY WITH YOU?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.530
JUST UNTIL
SPRING BREAK IS OVER

07:42.563 --> 07:43.531
AND I HEAD BACK
TO SCHOOL.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.599
WHAT?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.900
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.502
UH, THE MORGUE.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.872
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.807
SHE'S A CORONER IN IOWA.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.275
OKAY, THAT WAS A WEIRD WAY
TO SAY THAT,

07:55.308 --> 07:57.578
AND YOU KNOW IT.
JENNY, COME ON.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.547
THIS FEELS INAPPROPRIATE,
EVEN TO ME,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.682
AND I HAVE NO SENSE
OF BOUNDARIES.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.750
PLEASE, I MEAN, I--

08:02.783 --> 08:04.084
I LOOK UP TO YOU SO MUCH.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.085
YOU'VE GOT GREAT STYLE.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.754
YOU EAT
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.556
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.825
OKAY, YOU CAN STAY WITH ME
FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.761
AND YOU HAVE TO ASK
YOUR DAD PERMISSION FIRST.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.762
YEAH.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.163
THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY GOOD.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.798
YOU, AN IMPRESSIONABLE
YOUNG WOMAN,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.800
ME, A SOPHISTICATED
MANHATTANITE.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.169
YOU, WITH TINY FINGERS THAT CAN
REACH INTO MY AIR CONDITIONER

08:22.202 --> 08:23.637
AND RETRIEVE THAT DEAD BIRD.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.773
ME, SOMEONE WHO--
YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST GO,

08:25.806 --> 08:27.608
'CAUSE I'LL JUST
KEEP DOING THIS.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.079
OH, HEY, I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND,

08:32.112 --> 08:33.947
BUT I WAS LOOKING AROUND
FOR TOILET PAPER,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.148
'CAUSE ALL YOU HAVE
IN THE BATHROOM

08:35.182 --> 08:36.684
ARE NAPKINS
FROM A RESTAURANT...
MM-HMM.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.052
AND I PEEKED INSIDE
THAT BOX OVER THERE.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.021
ARE ALL THOSE GUYS
OLD BOYFRIENDS?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.656
YEAH.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.860
THIS BOX REPRESENTS
A TRAIL OF SLAIN DUDES

08:46.894 --> 08:49.096
THAT HAS KIND OF MADE ME
THE WOMAN THAT I AM TODAY.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.798
LET'S TAKE A PEEK.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.800
OH!
NURSE MORGAN'S IN HERE.

08:52.833 --> 08:53.901
HE'S SO CUTE.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.636
YEAH, WHAT IS HE DOING
IN THERE?

08:55.669 --> 08:56.937
DOES HE HAVE A SON?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.105
NO, THAT'S MY EX, DANNY.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.206
WHEN HE WEARS A BASEBALL HAT,

08:59.239 --> 09:00.741
IT MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE
A KINDERGARTNER.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.875
[sighs]

09:01.909 --> 09:03.677
LOOK AT HOW MANY
GUYS THERE ARE.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.745
OKAY, JENNY,

09:04.778 --> 09:07.014
DO NOT GET INTIMIDATED BY
MY CERTIFIED PLAYA STATUS.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.849
OKAY, ONE DAY, YOU, TOO,
WILL HAVE A BOX

09:08.882 --> 09:10.217
TEEMING WITH CONQUESTS.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.218
TEEMING?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.219
NOT TEEMING.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.887
LIKE, A GOOD NUMBER.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.189
THAT WAS A TEST, AND YOU
PASSED, MY LITTLE LAMB.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.861
HEY, PETE, I GOT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.795
WHAT IS THAT I HEAR,

09:21.829 --> 09:23.964
THE G-G-G-GHOST OF SOMEONE
WHO'S DEAD TO ME?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.799
OKAY, YOU'RE STILL MAD
I'M DATING YOUR SISTER.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.868
LISTEN, I HAVE A WAY TO GET
A TON OF NEW PATIENTS.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.770
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
THAT I RECENTLY SAVED THE LIFE

09:29.803 --> 09:31.772
OF RABBI DAVID ADLER.
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.874
I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT,
BUT THAT GUY IS AMAZING.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.308
EVERY YEAR, HE TEACHES
HODA AND KATHIE LEE

09:35.342 --> 09:36.744
WHAT A MENORAH IS.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.146
HE WANTS TO RECOMMEND US
TO HIS CONGREGATION.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.248
THE CATCH IS,
HE THINKS I'M JEWISH.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.415
WELL, I COULD SEE THAT.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.284
I MEAN, YOU DO COMPLAIN ABOUT
THE AIR CONDITIONING A LOT.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.853
IT'S DRAFTY IN MY OFFICE!

09:45.886 --> 09:47.788
IT'S REALLY--
IT'S DRAFTY.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.722
SO, WHAT, YOU NEED ME

09:48.756 --> 09:51.358
BECAUSE I'M THE OBVIOUS
CHILD OF A-BRO-HAM?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.160
JUST HELP ME OUT.
COME TO THIS DINNER WITH ME.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.328
IF I CONFUSE MY SCHLEMIELS
AND MY SCHLIMAZELS,

09:55.362 --> 09:57.030
THEN YOU COULD
SET ME STRAIGHT.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.366
FINE, BUT I GET 51%
OF THE NEW PATIENTS.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.701
NO WAY.
52%

10:00.734 --> 10:01.702
YOU DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.203
OKAY, FINE.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.337
53%.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.273
54%,
AND YOU GOT A DEAL.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.274
I GOT A DEAL.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.275
55%.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.276
NOT GOING BACK ON IT.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.211
DINNER.
56%.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.648
THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH WORK
I JUST TOOK ON.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.151
[knocks on door]

10:18.185 --> 10:19.987
BET YOU THINK YOU'RE
PRETTY CLEVER, DON'T YOU?

10:20.020 --> 10:20.988
I DO.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.656
ASK ME TO TIMES
ANY TWO NUMBERS,

10:22.690 --> 10:23.824
AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.258
SINGLE DIGITS ONLY,
NO NINES.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.094
JENNY'S OVER 18,
SO THERE'S NOTHING

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
I CAN DO LEGALLY
TO TAKE HER HOME.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.932
ILLEGALLY, I CAN HAVE YOU
FRAMED AS A MADAME.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.735
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL SCARED.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.936
JENNY IS COMPLETELY SAFE.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.304
IT'S MOSTLY JUST US EATING,
LIKE, JUNK FOOD

10:37.337 --> 10:39.239
AND HER HELPING ME FIGURE OUT
HOW TO USE MY PRINTER.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.174
GOOD.
THANK YOU.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.076
AND IF YOU NEED ME,
YOU CALL ME FOR ANY REASON.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.078
WELL,
SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT,

10:45.112 --> 10:46.680
THERE IS THIS
SHAWARMA STAND

10:46.714 --> 10:48.348
THAT I AM CERTAIN
IS TERRORISTS.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.382
OH, IT IS. WE KNOW.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.350
OH, AND, UH...

10:50.383 --> 10:52.219
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND GIVE HER THIS?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.921
IT'S HER FAVORITE BLANKET.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.289
ITS NAME IS, UM...

10:56.323 --> 10:57.357
BLANKY.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.926
OH. I HAD A BLANKY

10:58.959 --> 11:02.062
UNTIL OTHER MED STUDENTS
MADE FUN OF ME.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.832
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THAT
TO YOURSELF.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.105
[telephone rings]
HELLO? MINDY?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.941
HEY, JENNY.
LISTEN, YOUR DAD STOPPED BY

11:13.974 --> 11:15.809
TO SEE ME AT MY OFFICE.
OH, I KNOW.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.311
I FEEL SO BAD.
I'M GONNA GO HOME TOMORROW.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.313
BUT TONIGHT MY FRIEND NOEL
IS TAKING ME

11:20.347 --> 11:22.415
TO A FLASH AND DASH.
WHAT?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.884
NO,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.853
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU INVITE

11:25.886 --> 11:27.254
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS

11:27.287 --> 11:29.222
THAT WAY, I CAN CHILL WITH
SLASH KEEP AN EYE ON

11:29.256 --> 11:30.257
ALL OF THEM.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.925
YOU'D LET ME HAVE
PEOPLE OVER?

11:31.959 --> 11:33.126
YEAH, BITCH.

I SPEND, LIKE, 80%

11:35.162 --> 11:36.129
SOMEONE SHOULD BENEFIT.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.231

11:38.265 --> 11:40.734

GOD DOESN'T CARE

12:08.328 --> 12:09.362
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
A GOOD VOICE.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.264
BUT, YEAH, TO BE SAFE,
GO PRACTICE.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.533
DANNY,

12:13.566 --> 12:14.534
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS

12:21.975 --> 12:24.177
[knife scraping on plate]

12:24.211 --> 12:25.178
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
GOD WOULD WANT ME

12:25.212 --> 12:27.948
TO DISCUSS SUCH THINGS
AT THE SHABBOS TABLE.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.349
[laughs]

12:29.382 --> 12:30.784
IT'S ALL A LITTLE WEIRD.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.953

12:32.986 --> 12:34.354
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU

13:17.297 --> 13:19.399
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH HIS THING.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.500
IT HAS A HOOD ON IT.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.568
(Peter)
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.837
FIRST OF ALL,
I THOUGHT JEWS KNOCKED

13:23.871 --> 13:26.206
AND WE DON'T LOOK
DIRECTLY AT THINGS

13:26.239 --> 13:27.540
WHEN WE ENTER A ROOM.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.979
I-I'M--
I'M NOT CIRCUMCISED, SO...

WHY IS MY APARTMENT

14:00.340 --> 14:01.441
FULL OF HORNY,
GOOD-LOOKING TEENAGERS?

14:01.474 --> 14:03.143
YOU SAID I COULD HAVE
PEOPLE OVER.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.178
MY APARTMENT IS NOT A PLACE
FOR SENSUALITY.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.348
IT IS A PLACE FOR
REPRESSED SEXUALITY, OKAY?

IT'S A PLACE WHERE YOU
ORDER CHINESE FOOD,

14:21.194 --> 14:22.429
SHE TEXTED ME
AND SHE SAID

14:22.462 --> 14:24.397
THAT HER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
WAS IN DANGER,

14:24.431 --> 14:25.298
SO I CAME OVER HERE
TO HELP HER,

14:25.332 --> 14:28.268
AND THEN SHE HANDCUFFED ME
TO THE BED!

14:28.301 --> 14:29.469
IS THIS TRUE?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.071
YOU SAID INDEPENDENT WOMEN

14:31.104 --> 14:33.273
NEED TO MAKE SOME
MISTAKES WITH MEN.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.442
NOT WITH MORGAN!

14:35.475 --> 14:36.643
I'M GONNA LOSE MY VIRGINITY
TO HIM.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.445
NO, NO, NERP.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.446
OH, NO, YOU ARE NOT.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.647
YOU SAID HE WAS
A GOOD GUY.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.249
FOR, LIKE,
DROPPING OFF RECYCLING

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
OR HAVING HIM
CLEAN OUT YOUR CAR.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.618
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
I SOUND LIKE A REAL LOSER.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.587
THANK YOU, MORGAN.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.356
HE'S A REAL LOSER!
YOU GOT TO STOP
RUBBING MY LEG.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.358
IT'S SO CLOSE.
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.426
I'M CALLING YOUR
FATHER.
YES.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.362
I'M CALLING
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
NO! NO, NO, NO!

14:55.395 --> 14:57.397
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK
I'VE BEEN IN HANDCUFFS.

14:57.430 --> 15:07.474
SHE'LL FREAK OUT.
[phone dialing]

15:07.474 --> 15:17.484
SHE'LL FREAK OUT.
[phone dialing]

16:38.431 --> 16:39.232
GO HOME. SCRAM.
GET OUT THERE, MOHAWK.

16:39.266 --> 16:39.799
ALL RIGHT, THERE, NOSE RING,
LET'S GO.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.467
GO HOME.
EVERYBODY OUT.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.134
HEY, PICK UP
ON SOCIAL CUES.

16:41.168 --> 16:41.434
PUT YOUR JACKET
ON OUTSIDE.

16:41.468 --> 16:41.501
NARC.

16:43.303 --> 16:43.703
OH, WHAT'S THIS,
COCAINE?

16:43.736 --> 16:44.504
THAT'S NOT MINE.

16:44.537 --> 16:44.571
WELL, GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE IT IS.

16:45.272 --> 16:45.305
JENNIFER,
GO GET YOUR THINGS.

16:47.040 --> 16:47.540
(Danny)
HOW CAN A JEWISH GUY

16:47.574 --> 16:48.308
NOT BE CIRCUMCISED?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.509
MY FAMILY IS NOT
THAT JEWISH, OKAY?

16:49.542 --> 16:50.343
THE THEME OF MY BAR MITZVAH
WAS "CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT."

16:50.377 --> 16:52.145
BESIDES, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
JEWISH AT ALL!

16:52.179 --> 16:52.212
OKAY, RABBI,
DON'T LISTEN TO THIS...

16:52.679 --> 16:53.413
MESHUGENAH!

16:53.446 --> 16:54.214
I'M JUST SO SAD
AND DISAPPOINTED

16:54.247 --> 16:55.215
THAT YOU FELT
THIS NEED TO LIE.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.217
WELL, RABBI, THIS GUY
LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING.

16:57.250 --> 16:57.784
I DO NOT.
HE LIES ABOUT RELIGION,

16:57.817 --> 16:58.551
MATTERS OF THE HEART,

16:58.585 --> 16:59.286
WHETHER OR NOT
HE WEARS LIFTS.

16:59.319 --> 16:59.919
WELL, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN THAT.

16:59.952 --> 17:00.720
THOSE ARE ORTHOTICS, OKAY?

17:00.753 --> 17:01.288
THEN WHY DO THEY
MAKE YOU SO TALL?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.356
THEY'RE REALLY THICK.

17:03.390 --> 17:03.756
TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT 'EM
SO I CAN GET 'EM TOO!

17:03.790 --> 17:04.724
I DON'T LIE.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.525
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I LIED

17:05.558 --> 17:06.426
BESIDES EVERYTHING
I SAID TONIGHT.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.428
YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW, PAL.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.429
NO, I'M NOT.
ABOUT BEING IN LOVE
WITH SALLY

17:09.462 --> 17:10.097
WHEN CLEARLY SHE'S NOT
THE ONE YOU REALLY WANT.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.030
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:11.064 --> 17:11.598
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.233
[overlapping chatter]

17:13.266 --> 17:13.533
I THINK I DO!

17:13.566 --> 17:14.367
BOYS!

17:14.401 --> 17:15.202
I HAVE BEEN A RABBI
FOR 30 YEARS.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.035
I'VE SEEN MANY, MANY
CASES LIKE THIS.

17:16.069 --> 17:16.769
AND I BELIEVE
I HAVE SOME INSIGHT.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.605
WELL, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT,
RABBI.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.406
WELL, I'M NOT SHARING
MY INSIGHT!

17:19.439 --> 17:19.939
YOU SCHNOOKS
AREN'T EVEN JEWISH!

17:19.972 --> 17:20.440
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

17:20.473 --> 17:20.807
OKAY, THAT'S FAIR.

17:20.840 --> 17:20.873
YEP. YEAH...

17:21.574 --> 17:22.242
IF I COULD JUST SHOW IT TO YOU,

17:22.275 --> 17:22.309
I THINK YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND--

17:22.609 --> 17:23.643
GOT IT.

17:24.344 --> 17:24.677
JENNY, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

17:24.711 --> 17:25.378
A SEX PARTY?

17:25.412 --> 17:26.246
THAT'S NOT FOR
REGULAR PEOPLE.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.314
THAT'S FOR COUPLES
IN JOHN UPDIKE NOVELS.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.282
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS
I SAW YOUR BOX OF CONQUESTS.

17:29.316 --> 17:29.849
HEY, IT'S NOT
A BOX OF CONQUESTS.

17:29.882 --> 17:30.817
IT'S MY HEARTBREAK BOX.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.618
JENNY, WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M SWEARING OFF MEN?

17:31.651 --> 17:31.984
BECAUSE YOU SLEPT WITH
ALL OF THEM?

17:32.018 --> 17:32.752
LOOK, JENNY,

17:32.785 --> 17:34.454
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE
OF BEING A WOMAN

17:34.487 --> 17:35.322
WHO CAN MAKE
HER OWN DECISIONS

17:35.355 --> 17:36.289
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE GOOD DECISIONS.

17:36.323 --> 17:36.789
AND SOMETIMES GUYS CAN
GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.324
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.091
I GUESS I JUST WISH

17:38.125 --> 17:39.926
THERE WERE GUYS
INTERESTED IN ME

17:39.959 --> 17:40.693
SO I COULD MAKE
ANY DECISION AT ALL.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.794
(Mindy)
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.495
I DID NOT LOSE MY VIRGINITY
UNTIL I WAS 22 YEARS OLD.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.363
BUT THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND ME.

17:43.396 --> 17:43.863
I TELL EVERYONE I LOST
MY VIRGINITY AT 17

17:43.896 --> 17:45.765
TO CHRISTIAN SLATER.

17:45.798 --> 17:46.199
YOU'VE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:46.233 --> 17:46.933
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

17:46.966 --> 17:47.567
PLENTY OF GUYS
ARE GONNA WANT TO

17:47.600 --> 17:48.401
SNEAK IN THEM JEANS,
OKAY?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.202
YOUR DAD IS RIGHT;
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.637
(Charlie)
ALL RIGHT.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.037
YOU APOLOGIZE?

17:51.070 --> 17:51.704
I AM SO SORRY.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.105
WHAT ARE YOU
APOLOGIZING FOR?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.005
I DON'T KNOW.

17:53.039 --> 17:53.740
I'M JUST--WHEN YOU TALK,
I GET VERY SCARED.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.241
JENNY, APOLOGIZE
TO DR. LAHIRI.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.243
YOU THREW A PARTY,

17:56.276 --> 17:56.643
YOU LOST MY HANDCUFFS,
YOU ATE ALL HER FOOD.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.544
THAT'S ON ME.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.044
I ACTUALLY ZERO OUT
MY FRIDGE EVERY NIGHT

17:58.077 --> 17:58.611
BEFORE I GO TO BED.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.412
I'M SORRY, DR. LAHIRI.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.148
AND I'M SORRY TO YOU,
TOO, DAD.

18:01.181 --> 18:01.648
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.415
YOU'RE GROWN UP NOW.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.483
I JUST HAVE TO
GET USED TO IT.

18:03.516 --> 18:03.550
I'M GONNA HAVE PULASKI
STOP TAILING YOU AT COLLEGE.

18:04.184 --> 18:04.717
OH! AND DON'T FORGET BLANKY.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.118
WHOA, THIS IS VERY SOFT.

18:05.152 --> 18:05.185
CAN I KEEP IT?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.290
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
A LOCKSMITH?

18:10.323 --> 18:12.259
GO HOME.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.598
OH, GOD, DANNY.
YEAH.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.167
DANNY.
WHAT?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.468
MY EARBUDS ARE CAUGHT UP
IN MY SCARF,

18:21.501 --> 18:23.270
AND I CAN'T SEE MY NECK.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.671
I'M PANICKING!
OKAY, STOP FREAKING OUT.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.239
NO!
STOP--
GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THERE.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.575
YOU'RE LIKE A PELICAN
IN A FISHING NET RIGHT NOW.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.377
HELP ME!
OKAY, OKAY.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.378
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.612
LOOK, EARBUDS.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.347
OKAY. THEY SHOULD HAVE
A WARNING ON THOSE.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.348
YOU OKAY?

18:35.382 --> 18:36.616
I FEEL A LITTLE
FOOLISH NOW.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.617
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.718
THANK YOU.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.587
[sighs]
SO HOW'S...

18:40.620 --> 18:42.755
HOW'S THINGS GOING
WITH THAT PATIENT?

18:42.789 --> 18:43.890
OH, ACTUALLY PRETTY WELL.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.625
ALTHOUGH WHEN
I HAVE A DAUGHTER,

18:45.658 --> 18:46.826
IF SHE GOES TO COLLEGE,

18:46.859 --> 18:48.528
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
WITH HER AND SUPERVISE.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.896
PROBABLY ALL THE CUTE BOYS
WILL BE LIKE,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.931
"UH, WHO IS YOUR
YOUNGER SISTER?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.933
DOES SHE PUT OUT?
SHE'S REALLY HOT."

18:53.966 --> 18:55.635
AND I'LL BE LIKE,
"I'M THE MOM."

18:55.668 --> 18:57.204
YEAH, YOU'RE THE MOM.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.606
DANNY.
YEAH?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.707
THERE IS
A CIVIL WAR GENERAL

19:00.740 --> 19:02.242
WHO IS POINTING
AND WAVING AT YOU.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.910
OH, OKAY.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.612
I GOTTA GO
DEAL WITH THIS.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.879
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU KNOW HIM?

19:06.913 --> 19:09.382
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.
HOLD ON A SEC.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.750
RABBI...

19:10.783 --> 19:13.453
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.521
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.756
MY FAMILY WILL BE
TELLING THE STORY

19:16.789 --> 19:18.258
OF THE LYING GOY

19:18.291 --> 19:20.293
AND THE JEW WITH
THE BAGGY SCHMECKEL

19:20.327 --> 19:21.394
FOR AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.895
NO. IT WAS PRICELESS.

19:24.397 --> 19:28.201
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU AND SALLY THERE.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.769
FORGET ABOUT
WHAT PETER IS SAYING.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.739
IF WHAT THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE ISN'T REAL,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.776
THAT IS LOVE, MY FRIEND.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.279
OKAY, NO, THAT--
RABBI, THAT'S NOT--

19:39.312 --> 19:41.748
THERE'S NOTHING MORE JEWISH
THAN DATING AN ASIAN GIRL.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.416
BELIEVE ME ON THIS.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.552
WELCOME TO THE TRIBE,
DANIEL.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.828
WHAT?
OH, GOD,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.997
DO I HAVE CONDITIONER
CRUSTED ON MY EAR AGAIN?

19:58.030 --> 19:58.998
DAMN IT.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.267
NO, YOU'RE GOOD.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.935
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

20:02.969 --> 20:04.737
I'M GONNA GO ACROSS THE STREET
AND GET A BEAR CLAW.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.273
DIDN'T YOU JUST HAVE ONE
ON THE SUBWAY?

20:06.306 --> 20:09.276
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
BYE.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.221
HEY, SALLY, CAN WE GET
A CUP OF COFFEE AND TALK?

20:25.325 --> 20:26.293
[siren blares]

20:26.326 --> 20:28.561
OH, GOD! DAMN IT!

20:28.595 --> 20:29.929
[over loudspeaker]
MISS, STEP AWAY
FROM THE BEAR CLAW.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.631
THE BEAR CLAW HAS BEEN
ON THE STREET.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.899
THE STREET IS COVERED
IN URINE.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.636
WELL...

20:36.669 --> 20:37.970
SEEMS LIKE IN ADDITION TO

20:38.004 --> 20:39.539
KIDNAPPING
DETECTIVES' DAUGHTERS,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.741
YOU'RE ALSO A JAYWALKER.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.776
GUILTY AS CHARGED.
BETTER WRITE ME UP.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.813
WAIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.615
WE GOT QUOTAS.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE LIEUTENANT.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.949
WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON,
GOOD-LOOKING.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.352
MAYBE IF, UH,
I BUY YOU A BEAR CLAW,

20:52.385 --> 20:54.854
YOU COULD JUST, LIKE,
TEAR UP THAT LITTLE TICKET?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.589
ARE YOU BRIBING ME?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO
WRITE YOU ANOTHER TICKET,

20:58.525 --> 21:00.026
AND THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER
BRIBE FOR YOU.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.561
IT'S SORT OF--
OR ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT?

21:01.594 --> 21:02.895
AM I ASKING YOU OUT?

21:02.929 --> 21:06.299
OKAY, IN YOUR DREAMS,
OFFICER YOU WISH.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.301
BESIDES, I TOLD YOU I'M
SWEARING OFF GUYS.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.002
I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T
HEAR YOU OVER THE...

21:10.036 --> 21:12.038
THAT COAT.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.475
THIS IS CANARY YELLOW,
MY FRIEND.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.445
OH, FOR THE RECORD,
I'M NOT A GUY.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
I'M A MAN.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.088
WOW.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.657
$300?

21:30.690 --> 21:31.991
AH, DAMN IT!

21:32.024 --> 21:34.060
(man)
GO TO BED.
