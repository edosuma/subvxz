-<I> MISSISSIPPI'S WHERE -- WHERE</I>
<I> I'M FROM, BORN AND RAISED.</I>

00:19.020 --> 00:21.487
MISSISSIPPI BLOOD
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.389
FROM NORTH MISSISSIPPI
TO DELTA

00:23.391 --> 00:24.990
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO JACKSON.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.326
- MOM HAD 9 OF US.
I'M THE BABY OF 9.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.661

00:29.663 --> 00:31.897
...AND ALL THE DRUG DEALERS,
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY WAS AT

00:31.899 --> 00:33.732
SO I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A DRUG DEALER.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.502
THE WOMEN, THE MONEY
AND THE FAST CARS.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.704

I GREW UP IN JACKSON.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.907
UH, MY MOM AND THEM,
BOTH PARENTS GREW UP IN PEARL.

FROM PEARL HIGH SCHOOL

00:44.378 --> 00:46.645
MY DAD ALSO DID.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.849

01:06.333 --> 01:09.334
...AND I PULL IT OFF.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.504
BUT AFTER THE JOB,
IT ALL WENT SOUTH.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.373
-<I> WHAT HAPPENED?</I>

01:14.375 --> 01:17.976

01:25.518 --> 01:28.320
I GRABBED MY SHOTGUN

01:34.994 --> 01:38.697
SO THEY SENT MY ASS TO JAIL
AND I SERVED MY TIME LIKE A MAN.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.668
AND I DIDN'T SNITCH ON NOBODY.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.957

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN TO
TAKE THEM CLOTHES OFF

27:54.740 --> 27:56.240
ALL THE WAY ON STAGE.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.642

<I> THIS REPRESENTS MY LIFE</I>
<I> IN THE STRIP CLUB.</I>

33:26.804 --> 33:28.939

33:42.921 --> 33:45.655
I MEAN, I'D WATCH OTHER GIRLS

33:48.794 --> 33:52.162

TO DO EVERYTHING.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.197
THAT'S WHY I GO BY UNIQUE.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.934
THE ONE WHERE I FLIP
UPSIDE DOWN AND BOUNCE

33:57.936 --> 33:59.102
THAT'S GOTTA BE MY HARDEST ONE.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.038

WANT TO WORK THERE

34:13.952 --> 34:16.219
THEN I DON'T WANT YOU
WORKING THERE NEITHER.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.754

GOING BACK THERE.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.755
-<I> OKAY. GOOD.</I>

34:21.793 --> 34:23.260
- DID YOU SEE HIM
PUT HIS HANDS ON ME?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.795
- IF HE FUCKING TOUCHES

34:24.797 --> 34:26.630
I'LL FUCKING
PISTOL-WHIP HIS ASS

34:26.632 --> 34:28.297
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.467
<I> FUCK, HE'S ALREADY</I>
<I> SCARED OF ME.</I>

34:30.469 --> 34:32.402
<I> PRETTY LARRY BITCH.</I>

34:34.739 --> 34:36.373
- WELL, YOU CAME IN THERE

34:36.375 --> 34:37.574
AND RIPPED YOUR SHIRT OFF.

- MAN, THIS IS GONNA
BLOW YOUR MIND.

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:19.988
I WAS GOING BY HOOTERS ACTUALLY

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.157
AND I SEE THIS GUY'S
CAMARO PULL IN

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:23.491
SO I PULL IN BEHIND HIM.

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:25.093
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK HIM
FOR MY MONEY.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.429
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS
AND HE AIN'T PAID ME.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:30.131
SO WHEN I GOT OUT, I SAID,
"HEY, MAN, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA GIVE ME MY MONEY?"

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.267
AND HE'S LIKE, "I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR FREAKING MONEY
WHEN I GET READY."

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.602
BEFORE HE GOT
"FREAK" OUT OF HIS MOUTH

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:35.570
I SMACKED HIM WITH MY PISTOL.

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:37.305
AND IT WENT OFF AND THEN
HE DROPPED TO THE GROUND

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:38.607
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:40.742
I WENT IN HIS POCKET
AND I WAS TAKING MY MONEY

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.244
AND THEN SOMEBODY SEEN

THEY CALLED THE POLICE ON ME.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.014
HE HAD 300 BUCKS IN HIS POCKET.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:49.417
300 BUCKS COST ME
6 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN PRISON.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.638

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.072
- HEY, HEY,<I> CALMATE, CALMATE,</I>
CALM DOWN, FLAVOR.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.478
TEAR IT APART
IF YOU FUCKING HAVE TO.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.481
- JUST CALL C.J., MAN.
THIS IS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.852
-<I> WHO THE FUCK IS C.J.?</I>

01:10:57.854 --> 01:10:59.887
- HONEY,
KERMIT DIDN'T HAVE A JOB.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:02.423
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.593
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING NOW.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.362
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.607

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.609

WHO OWES HIM SOMETHING.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.981
-<I> WHERE THE FUCK IS MY SON?</I>

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:29.350
- HEY, YOU CUT HAIR?

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.718
- YEAH.

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:34.289
- HEY, THIS IS JORGE'S HOMIE.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.624
-<I> YEAH, MAN,</I>

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.695
- JORGE'S OUR BOY.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.434
- BILLY, I WANNA HEAR
ONE THING FROM YOU.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:49.170
NO HARM IS GONNA COME TO MY SON.

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:51.072
-<I> KERMIT'S OKAY.</I>

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:52.407

-<I> NO HARM IS GOING TO COME</I>
<I> TO YOUR SON.</I>

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.246
- GOODBYE.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:05.286
-<I> HOW IN THE FUCK DID YOU</I>
<I> END UP HERE IN MY HOUSE?</I>

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:08.489
- I JUST MET THIS GIRL --
- YEAH, I THINK
WE GOT THAT PART.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.858
YOU'RE NOT MUCH
OF A STORYTELLER, ARE YOU?

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.860
<I> START FROM THE BEGINNING.</I>

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.205
-<I> MY DAD DIED</I>
<I> WHEN I WAS A KID.</I>

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.309
FUCKED ME UP REAL GOOD.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.980
<I> STARTED GETTING IN TROUBLE</I>
<I> AT SCHOOL.</I>

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:35.216
<I> GETTING INTO FIGHTS</I>
<I> ALL THE TIME.</I>

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.719
<I> SO I STARTED SELLING</I>
<I> WITH MY BOY C.J.</I>

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.722
<I> STARTED OUT SELLING DIME BAGS</I>

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:44.459
<I> THEN MOVED UP</I>
<I> TO DOING RUNS AND STUFF.</I>

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.895
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO C.J.
SENDS ME OUT ON THIS BIG JOB.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:53.134
BIGGEST ONE YET
AND I PULL IT OFF.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:57.071
BUT AFTER THE JOB,
IT ALL WENT SOUTH.

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.844
- WHAT HAPPENED?

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:06.814
- WELL, I WENT HOME

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:08.916
AND I CAUGHT THAT MOTHERFUCKER

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:12.453
LARRY PRETTY IN THE HOT TUB
WITH MY MOM.

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:15.289
- I WOULD HAVE KILLED HIS ASS.
- I TRIED.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:18.626
I GRABBED MY SHOTGUN
AND I STARTED BLASTING.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.095
- YOU NEED
TARGET PRACTICE, HOMIE.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:24.999
- SO THEY SENT MY ASS TO JAIL
AND I SERVED MY TIME LIKE A MAN.

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.570
<I>AND I DIDN'T SNITCH ON NOBODY.</I>

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.143
- JUST STAY ON THE COUCH
IF YOU WANT TO.

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.515
-<I> FORGET THE MONEY.</I>
<I> JUST COME HOME.</I>

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:45.153
-<I> SO A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO</I>
<I> I GET OUT..</I>

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:50.224
...AND BAM,
I MEET THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:52.794
- OH, THAT'S THE GIRL YOU WAS
TALKING ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:57.398
- HEY, FLAVOR.
-<I> HEY, HOLD UP.</I>

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.667
- 45 IN THE TRUNK,
5 IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:01.702
- I SAID HOLD UP!

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:05.306
WE'RE HAVING MOTHERFUCKING
STORY TIME UP IN HERE.

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:06.340
FUCK.

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.143
KEEP GOING.

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:14.949
- SO I MET THIS GIRL
AND HER MOM'S SICK

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:18.019
<I> AND THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY</I>
<I> FOR THE BILLS.</I>

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:21.022
FOR THE FIRST TIME
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE NEEDS ME.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:28.763
I PROMISED MYSELF THAT
THIS WOULD BE MY LAST JOB.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:31.432
THAT I'D PAY THEIR BILLS
AND I'D GET OUT OF THE GAME.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:42.143
- I AIN'T KILLING JORGE'S HOMIE
OVER NO WHITE BOY SHIT.

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.250
- GET THE WEED.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:53.421
LARRY PRETTY AND YOUR MOM, HUH?

01:14:53.423 --> 01:14:55.490
THAT'S SOME FUCKED UP SHIT,
HOMIE.

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:13.241
- ALRIGHT, MAN.

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:06.193
<I> EVERYTHING'S OKAY.</I>

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:09.997
<I> I'LL BE HOME SOON.</I>

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:32.079
- ALL MY LIFE
I ALWAYS TRIED TO DO STUFF

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.881
SO I COULD GET MONEY,
I WANTED TO GET MONEY

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:37.051
GET MONEY, GET MONEY, BUT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PURPOSE

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.620
BEHIND WHAT YOU GETTING
THE MONEY FOR, IT'S..

01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:41.656
IT DON'T -- IT DON'T,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THE WAY.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.858
IT'S NOT GOING TO END HAPPY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.326
I NEVER HAD TO GO TO PRISON.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.628
I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT.
I'M -- I'M BLESSED.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.031
I'M BLESSED TO BE HERE
WITH Y'ALL.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.399
- I WANT TO MOVE
TO NORTH CAROLINA.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:53.634
IT'S COUNTRY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:17:53.636 --> 01:17:56.270
I WANT MY KIDS
TO BE AROUND SNOW.

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:59.173
I'M NOT QUITE FUCKING SURE
EXACTLY WHICH PART OF IT

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.777
BUT I JUST KNOW THAT'S
AROUND ABOUT WHERE I WANT TO BE.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.613
I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE
UNTIL MY DAD PASSES, SO..

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.288
- Y'ALL GOT A BATHROOM?

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.881

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.822
<I> I'M GETTING PULLED OVER.</I>

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.361
<I> I LOVE YOU.</I>

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.262

THE ROAD BACK THERE, RIGHT?

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.198
LET ME SEE YOUR LICENSE

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.339

MAMA. MAMA.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.349

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.338
- SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP ME
CLIMB THE POLE

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:05.639
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:08.642
- <I> YOU CAN DO IT.</I>

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:10.644

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:58.619

<I>AND THAT WAS MY WIFE, CRYSTAL.</I>

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:29.029
I'VE LIVED A CRAZY LIFE, MAN.
IT WAS FULL OF ADVENTURE.

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:30.997
I MEAN, THERE -- THERE WAS
NEVER A DULL MOMENT

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.766
IN MY LIFE TO BE HONEST.

01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:35.736
I MEAN, IT WASN'T ALWAYS GOOD,
BUT THERE WASN'T A DULL MOMENT.

01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:37.738
I WAS ALWAYS INTO SOMETHING.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.480
- HEY!

01:29:46.482 --> 01:29:48.448
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
TO MY CAR?

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:50.283
THAT'S MY CAR.

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:52.285
- PERFECT TIMING.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:54.721
I'M RANDY.

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:58.325
KERMIT'S UNCLE.

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:04.531
HE ASKED ME TO COME BY
AND FIX HER UP, BUT..

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:10.137
WELL, KERMIT WANTED IT
TO BE A SURPRISE.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:15.242
SURPRISE.

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:20.280
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH
COUPLE OF WEEKS, HAVEN'T YOU?

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.218
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.228
- YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO?

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:38.298
- I'M THINKING FLORIDA.

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.835
IT'S SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT.

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.309
I'M REALLY SORRY.

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.983
- YOU LISTEN TO ME
AND YOU LISTEN TO ME GOOD.

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.454
THERE WAS NEVER A DECISION
IN THAT BOY'S LIFE

01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:02.456
THAT HE DID NOT MAKE ON HIS OWN.

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.993
HE WOULD BE REAL HAPPY TO KNOW

01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:10.530
THAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT
OF THIS PLACE.

01:31:10.532 --> 01:31:11.865
- YES, MA'AM.
