01:07.267 --> 01:10.270
{\an5}YOU ARE WELCOME.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.373
WHETHER YOU WANT IT

01:18.678 --> 01:21.014
"TIMMY THE BARBARIAN."

01:21.080 --> 01:24.584
{\an4}ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A HUMAN CHILD
NAMED TIMMY TURNER,

01:24.651 --> 01:27.120
WHO--OH, THIS IS SO BORING.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.755
HEY, WHAT THE HECK?

01:28.822 --> 01:32.625
{\an4}OH, NO. WE'RE TRAPPED

01:52.212 --> 01:57.417
{\an4}Jorgen: SO HE WISHES
THE WHOLE WORLD WAS LIKE
THIS BARBARIAN MOVIE HE SAW,

01:57.484 --> 01:59.819
{\an1}BECAUSE BARBARIANS GET TO TAKE
WHAT THEY WANT, KICK BUTT,

01:59.886 --> 02:00.820

03:23.436 --> 03:24.571
{\an1}Timmy and Jorgen:
IT'S NOT JUST ANY BRIDGE.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.272
Jorgen: HEY! THAT IS MY LINE.

03:26.339 --> 03:30.777
