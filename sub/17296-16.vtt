Saint Patrick's Day!

00:26.635 --> 00:28.811
We got a St. Patrick's Day
job to do.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.117
Catch a leprechaun.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.336
And acquire his three wishes.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.861
I still thinks we should be going
after his pot of gold, y'all.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.125
Wishes are better than gold.
It's no contest.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.650
With a wish, you can wish
your dreams to come true.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.565
Now, come on!
Let's get to work.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.006
Uh-uh-uh.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.139
This leprechaun trap
is diabolical, yo.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.533
From a distance, that dirty
leprechaun be attracted by sparkles.

00:55.577 --> 00:59.755
He's put at ease by the
rainbow and shamrock stickers.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.062
Then he'll climb
up the pretzel stick ladder,

01:02.105 --> 01:04.760
traipse carelessly across
the cotton ball clouds,

01:04.803 --> 01:06.849
fall into the box and snap!

01:06.892 --> 01:08.764
We got ourselves a leprechaun!

01:08.807 --> 01:11.897
Uh! And then he gots
to give us them wishes, y'all.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.769
- Oh, yeah. That's right!
- Catch him, catch him...

01:13.812 --> 01:15.379
- Chop, chop...
- Guys!

01:15.423 --> 01:18.991
There is no way this thing
is gonna catch a leprechaun...

01:19.035 --> 01:20.341
Awww!

01:20.384 --> 01:22.082
...without bait!

01:22.125 --> 01:23.474
Oh!

01:23.518 --> 01:27.174
Leprechaun's can't
resist gold, remember?

01:27.217 --> 01:31.134
I wonder why they have this such
intense love of the yellow metal.

01:31.178 --> 01:34.572
I bet it's 'cause gold is used
to determine the value of money.

01:34.616 --> 01:37.575
You're thinking of the gold standard,
a fixed exchange rate regime

01:37.619 --> 01:40.187
in which the official exchange
rate is tied to the price of gold.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.711
We haven't been on the
gold standard for decades.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.279
Oh! Then they probably
likes it 'cause it's shiny.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.541
Shh! Quiet!

01:46.584 --> 01:48.630
- I see one.
- Quick. Hide.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.592
I think he's going for it.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.246
Oh, yeah!

01:56.290 --> 01:58.640
Wow! We actually caught one.

01:58.683 --> 02:01.164
He is thus, so tiny.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.253
I'm the height of
an average person.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.299
We's trapped you.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.301
So give us our wishes, fool.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.085
I'm not a leprechaun anymore.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.609
Once a leprechaun,
always a leprechaun.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.307
Wishes. Now!

02:13.350 --> 02:15.222
Request for wishes, denied.

02:15.265 --> 02:19.443
Continue to refuse us, and you
shall lawfully receive...

02:19.487 --> 02:20.923
...the pinches.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.360
You wouldn't.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.709
Pinch.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.189
- Stop it.
- Pinch.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.191
Come on, guys!

02:28.235 --> 02:29.279
Pinch.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.198
Fine.

02:35.242 --> 02:38.419
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Tell me your wishes, three.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.117
Nice.
First wish, we want hats.

02:42.597 --> 02:43.946
Sick!

02:43.989 --> 02:47.297
The second wish,
we want the hats to be...

02:47.341 --> 02:48.864
...the sideways.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.217
Oh!

02:54.261 --> 02:56.872
Oh! This is the Fresh Dope.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.787
The Fresh Dope Style.

02:58.830 --> 03:03.226
It's like, my face is going this
way, but my hat is going that way.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.533
What!

03:05.576 --> 03:07.491
Just make your last wish.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.190
I don't want to spend any more time
as a leprechaun than I have to.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.801
How comes you don't like
being a leprechaun, bro?

03:12.844 --> 03:14.324
Because it's terrible.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.674
The compulsion to fix shoes
day and night.

03:16.718 --> 03:20.200
Not to mention, people always
trying to steal your cereal,

03:20.243 --> 03:22.637
when you just want to
eat breakfast in peace.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.334
And worst of all,

03:24.378 --> 03:27.250
you become obsessed with gold.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.339
I like gold.

03:29.383 --> 03:32.777
Tell me that after your back goes out
carrying a 200 pound pot of gold, every day.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.565
It is only through
my powerful mental fortitude

03:37.608 --> 03:41.351
that I can repress my leprechaun
urges, and live a normal life.

03:41.395 --> 03:45.703
What's a normal life when you can
ride rainbows and have a pot of gold?

03:45.747 --> 03:47.749
I wish I was a leprechaun.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.099
Wish granted.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.888
Oh! Sick, dude.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.368
Check out my beard.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.674
Oh, and my shoes.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.067
Buckle me shoes, yo.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.722
You little goof, you
messed up that last wish.

04:04.766 --> 04:08.117
Yeah, we were gonna wish our hats
all the way backwards, remember?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.903
And now they are just stuck
only the sideways.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.558
Forget the hats, yo.
I'm a leprechaun, now.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.561
That means we can do all
that sick leprechaun business,

04:17.605 --> 04:19.346
without having to catch Robin.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.610
You mean, you can hook us up
with rainbows and corned beef?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.830
Oh!

04:25.874 --> 04:28.790
I'ma live that
leprechaun life, son!

04:32.228 --> 04:34.317

04:34.361 --> 04:36.406

Mmm. So then Beast Boy brings
us to this enchanted meadow.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.393
We all up on these
tree stumps, dancing.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.872
Oh, man. It was awesome.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.831
Mmm. Sounds like
a magical adventure.

05:09.874 --> 05:13.878
Aww. Mad because you were wrong about
leprechaun life being terrible?

05:13.922 --> 05:15.402
- I am not.
- Whoo!

05:15.445 --> 05:18.143
If I was that wrong,
I would be Superman.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.102
Like all veins
popping out, sweaty.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.234
You know what I'm talking about.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.888
I am not angry.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.195
And I am not wrong!
You'll see.

05:26.238 --> 05:29.154
You'll see what a leprechaun
life is really about.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.115
Friend Beast Boy.
What are you doing?

05:35.117 --> 05:37.380
Don't you know?
This cereal is mine.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.165
It's wonderful, and magical
and super tasty.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.472
Why would a leprechaun
care about cereal?

05:42.516 --> 05:43.778
Come on, give it back?

05:43.821 --> 05:46.650
Uh-uh-uh.
Nobody eats me cereal.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.173
Dude, just give us the cereal.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.568
Nobody eats me cereal!

05:55.920 --> 05:57.574
Your shoes look busted.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.620
- They look fine to me.
- Na-ah-ah.

05:59.663 --> 06:03.188
Your back seams are all frayed.
Look at those busted insoles.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.408
You're gonna have fallen arches.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.844
Dude, our shoes are fine.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.977
Let me cobble them shoes.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.848
- Oh! Cobble, cobble, cobble.
- Ah!

06:10.892 --> 06:13.416
Cobble, cobble, cobble.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.939
Cob-cobbling.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.768
Leprechaun life.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.858
I don't care if he repaired my insoles.
Taking a dude's feet off,

06:20.902 --> 06:22.773
that just ain't right.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.384
We've been robbed!

06:24.427 --> 06:27.474
What criminal fiend
would dare steal from us?

06:27.517 --> 06:30.781
Hey, I ain't no fiend.
I'm a leprechaun.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.827
And I just sold
all of that junk.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.612
Dude, you sold
all our stuff for cash?

06:35.656 --> 06:37.309
Cash!

06:38.441 --> 06:40.922
Why would
a leprechaun want cash?

06:40.965 --> 06:43.707
I traded it for gold.

06:43.751 --> 06:47.319
He's been overtaken by the
leprechaun's lust for gold.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.409
Hmm. Yes.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.063
Oh, shiny, shiny.

06:52.107 --> 06:56.720
But you can't have any.
It's mine! All mine!

06:56.764 --> 06:58.505
We don't want your gold, fool.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.812
Well, you should.
I'm getting us back
on the gold standard.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.249
What is exactly this
golden standard?

07:04.293 --> 07:08.166
It's the monetary system where paper
money gets value directly related to gold,

07:08.210 --> 07:12.780
you dummies. You tell me a dollar is worth
25 and eight-tenths grains of gold.

07:12.823 --> 07:17.393
We all know, what's what.
But that dirty President Nixon, back in '71

07:17.437 --> 07:20.440
unilaterally took the entire
country off the standard.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.051
And ever since then, we've
been based on the dollar value

07:23.094 --> 07:26.010
on a freely floating
exchange rate!

07:26.054 --> 07:28.448
The money ain't tied
to a specific item of value.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.625
And it's all make believe numbers
and market manipulations.

07:31.668 --> 07:36.151
But now, me and my gold will
be safe from financial ruin.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.283
How do you like that,
President Nixon?

07:38.327 --> 07:41.112
Huh?
Back on the standard, baby.

07:45.508 --> 07:50.165
Beast Boy has escaped over the rainbow and
into the federal Reserve Bank of Jump City.

07:50.208 --> 07:54.343
He truly is attempting
to restore the gold standard.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.040
Not on my watch.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.608
We need to catch him.
Secure his three wishes.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.306
And use one to release him
from the leprechaun curse.

08:01.350 --> 08:05.267
But to beat a leprechaun,
we must become leprechauns.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.495
Ready, lads and lasses?

08:15.538 --> 08:16.496
Aye!

08:18.585 --> 08:19.977
Har, yes.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.893
Gonna fix that
exchange rate, son.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.809
Beast Boy!

08:25.853 --> 08:27.724
We can still
end this peacefully.

08:27.768 --> 08:31.380
When I'm about to stabilize
the value of currency?

08:31.423 --> 08:32.773
No way!

08:32.816 --> 08:36.211
It won't stabilize anything.
It's all arbitrary.

08:36.254 --> 08:39.867
The value of gold can be manipulated
by those who produce it.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.305
What! Why would that worry me
when I gots all the gold.

08:43.348 --> 08:46.961
Your unilaterally moving the economy
back onto the gold standard.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.267
Don't you see? If you do this,

08:49.311 --> 08:52.009
you're no better than Nixon.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.838
Did you just call me Nixon?

09:07.111 --> 09:09.984
Penny pincher!

09:14.815 --> 09:16.599
Buckle me shoe!

09:19.515 --> 09:23.258
Shillelagh!

09:24.738 --> 09:28.437
Four-spirits clover!

09:33.834 --> 09:35.531
Yeah!

09:38.795 --> 09:41.145
Fair and square.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.626
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Tell me your wishes, three.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.541
First wish, we want hats.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.458
Now make them the sideways.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
Give us those backwards. Ow!

09:52.679 --> 09:54.942
Stop that!
You're wasting the wishes.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.774
We wish you were
Beast Boy again.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.519
Oh, thanks Robin.

10:07.563 --> 10:11.175
Man, you weren't kidding.
Leprechaun life is hard.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.700
Can't believe I almost messed
up the economy, y'all.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.267
Happens to the best of us.
Come on. Let's go home.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.619
We can discuss the advantages of a
floating exchange rate regime on the way.

10:19.662 --> 10:23.100
I'll show you, Nixon.
