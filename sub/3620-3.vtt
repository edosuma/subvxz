09:15.772 --> 09:17.165
I DON'T?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.036
NO. THE CREDENTIALS SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES.

09:19.210 --> 09:22.039
BESIDES...YOU'RE HONEST...
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.695
VERY IMPORTANT TRAITS
EVERY HIGH-LEVEL EXEC
SHOULD HAVE.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.175
HIGH-LEVEL EXEC?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.220
THAT'S WHERE I'D PLACE YOU
BASED ON EVERYTHING

09:29.394 --> 09:30.308
I'M SEEING HERE.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.962
SMILE.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.837
IT'S FOR
THE BACKGROUND CHECK.
IT'S PRO FORMA.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.534
BACKGROUND CHECK?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.101
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS,
SEE WHAT I CAN COME UP WITH...

09:40.275 --> 09:42.364
AND WE'LL MEET AGAIN
WEDNESDAY. IS THAT
ALL RIGHT?

09:42.538 --> 09:45.280
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S GREAT.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.890
THANK YOU.

09:47.064 --> 09:47.978
SURE.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.144
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.407
Piper: ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T A PROBLEM AT ALL.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.888
IT WENT A LOT BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.672
I WON'T SAY
I TOLD YOU SO.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.196
GOOD. DON'T.
HOW'S THE MOTLEY CREW?

10:32.370 --> 10:33.589
UH, THEY'RE DOING FINE.

10:33.763 --> 10:36.157
THEY'RE ENJOYING
THEIR SUNDAES AS WE SPEAK.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.115
ACTUALLY, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE MOMS.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.640
BE CAREFUL OF EVE.
SHE CAN KIND OF BE...

10:40.814 --> 10:41.641
PIPER...

10:41.815 --> 10:42.859
WHAT?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.034
I CAN HANDLE IT.
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.470
CELEBRATE.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.689
CELEBRATE WHAT?

10:46.863 --> 10:48.735
YOUR NEW LIFE.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.349
UH, USE YOUR WORDS, SWEETIE.

10:54.523 --> 10:58.092
I SWEAR, IF EDITH STANDS UP
ONE MORE TIME AT PTA,
SHE'S GOTTA GO.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.224
GET RID OF HER.
CEMENT SHOE CITY.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.444
SHE'S JOKING,
OF COURSE.

11:02.618 --> 11:06.274
OH, I GET IT.
JUST PRETEND I'M
ONE OF THE GALS.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.579
MOMMY SAID USE YOUR WORDS.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.800
OH, DOES THIS AGRO STAGE
EVER STOP?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.672
NOT IF YOU'RE LIKE
MY HUSBAND...

11:12.846 --> 11:16.632
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SOME MEN ARE SENSITIVE.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.112
LOOK AT YOU
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.940
TAKING CARE OF
YOUR COUSIN'S KIDS.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.290
IT'S WHAT FAMILY DOES.

11:22.464 --> 11:23.639
YEAH, BUT MOST MEN
WOULDN'T SET ASIDE
THEIR CAREER

11:23.813 --> 11:25.119
FOR THE SAKE
OF THE CHILDREN.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.556
GOD, I JUST--

11:27.730 --> 11:29.950
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.953
OK, ENOUGH.
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE,

11:33.127 --> 11:35.782
BUT MOMMY TOLD YOU
IF YOU CAN'T USE IT SAFELY,
SHE'S TAKING IT AWAY.

11:35.956 --> 11:36.783
COME ON.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.786
AND ALL ON YOUR OWN.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.005
NO RING.
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED?

11:42.179 --> 11:45.661
OH, UM, ACTUALLY,
IT'S A LONG STORY.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.446
MOMMY! MOMMY!

11:48.620 --> 11:49.970
OH!

11:50.144 --> 11:53.147
OH, GOD,
I AM SO SORRY.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.497
IT'S OK. IT WAS--
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.978
HERE.
LET ME CLEAN THAT OFF.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.719
OH, GOD.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.039
SUSPECT IS CONSIDERED
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.085
APPROACH WITH EXTREME CAUTION
AND ON MY ORDERS ONLY.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.434
WE DON'T WANT
ANY CIVILIANS HURT.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.435
COPY THAT.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.958
COPY THAT, LIEUTENANT.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.438
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST
NOT USED TO IT, I GUESS.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.266
WHAT, FEELING HAPPY?

12:25.440 --> 12:29.618
NO. I MEAN,
THE GUY'S PROBABLY
JUST BLOWING SMOKE ANYWAY.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.315
HE'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA CALL
WITH ANY REAL OPPORTUNITIES.

12:31.489 --> 12:34.144
NOW THAT'S THE OLD PIPER
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.450
JENNY.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.365
NOBODY'S LISTENING.
AND NOBODY CARES.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.019
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.848
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HEAR THAT DEX CARES.

12:42.022 --> 12:45.677
YEAH, UNTIL THE EARTHQUAKE
DESTROYS EVERYTHING
HE'S EVER WORKED FOR.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.157
WHAT EARTHQUAKE?

12:47.331 --> 12:48.593
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT
RUINING A MOMENT.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.986
WHAT MOMENT?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.162
YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.729
WHEN YOU LOOK
INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES

12:53.903 --> 12:57.124
AND YOU CAN FEEL
THE ROMANCE
AND THE PASSION...

12:57.298 --> 12:59.082
THE DESIRE.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.431
IT'S BEEN SUCH
A VERY LONG MOMENT

13:00.605 --> 13:01.998
SINCE I'VE HAD A MOMENT.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.521
I MEAN, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO MARRY A GUY

13:03.695 --> 13:05.697
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW

13:05.872 --> 13:07.177
WITHOUT HAVING THE MOMENT?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.919
BUT REALLY,
BACK TO THIS EARTHQUAKE.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.530
MAYBE YOUR PREMONITION
WAS SO YOU COULD STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.663
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO STOP AN EARTHQUAKE?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.404
5.5, 6, 7?

13:16.578 --> 13:17.666
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.102
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.061
MAYA HOLMES!
THIS IS THE POLICE!

13:21.235 --> 13:23.585
STAND UP AND PUT
YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

13:26.196 --> 13:27.763
I THINK THEY'RE
TALKING TO YOU.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.556
OH...

13:38.730 --> 13:40.254
GOT SOMEWHERE
YOU NEED TO BE?

13:40.428 --> 13:41.777
OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST NEED
TO STOP AN EARTHQUAKE.

13:41.951 --> 13:42.996
PHOEBE!

13:43.170 --> 13:44.693
WHAT? IT WAS
YOUR IDEA, PAIGE.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.435
YEAH, THAT WAS BEFORE
PIPER GOT ARRESTED
FOR MURDER.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.266
OH, MY GOD.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.138
5 MINUTES.
MAKE 'EM COUNT.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.226
OH, HONEY,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.967
ORANGE IS SO NOT
YOUR COLOR.

13:58.141 --> 13:58.968
PAIGE!

13:59.142 --> 14:00.491
WHAT? IT'S TRUE.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.972
OK, DON'T WORRY
BECAUSE WE'VE
FOUGHT DEMONS,

14:03.146 --> 14:04.104
WE'VE FOUGHT WARLOCKS.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.149
THIS IS JUST
A MINOR BLIP.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.368
I DON'T THINK SO!

14:07.542 --> 14:08.717
THEY THINK
I'M SOMEBODY ELSE.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.675
WELL, YOU ARE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.286
NO, BUT I'M NOT
A FUGITIVE.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.244
THAT'S NOT THE ALIAS
THAT I PICKED.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.942
AT LEAST
NOT INTENTIONALLY.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.813
NOW HAVE
YOU CALLED DARRYL?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.467
WE DID AND WE LEFT HIM
A MESSAGE,

14:19.641 --> 14:21.295
BUT HE'S ON
THE EAST COAST NOW,

14:21.469 --> 14:22.818
SO I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP US.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.603
WELL, HOW DID
YOU CHOOSE THIS
DISGUISE ANYWAY?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.040
[SIGHS]

14:27.214 --> 14:29.520
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DID.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.218
WELL, YOU HAD TO HAVE
GOTTEN IT SOMEWHERE.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.567
YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST
PLUCKED IT OUT OF
THE COSMOS.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.438
WELL, NO, I GUESS NOT.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.918
Phoebe: OK, YOU HAVE
TO TRY TO REMEMBER.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.964
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN
HER FACE SOMEWHERE.

14:38.138 --> 14:43.143
MAYBE TV OR INTERNET
OR THE NEWSPAPER.
SOMETHING. THINK.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.622
MAYBE IT WAS
A MAGAZINE.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.190
A MAGAZINE. OK, GOOD.
ANY IDEA WHICH MAGAZINE?

14:47.364 --> 14:48.931
WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

14:49.105 --> 14:51.020
ONE OF THE ONES
YOU ALL HAVE LAYING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.369
AND YOU'RE GOING
WHERE WITH THIS?

14:52.543 --> 14:53.675
WELL, I'M JUST THINKING
IF WE COULD FIND

14:53.849 --> 14:55.329
THE PICTURE
THAT INSPIRED HER,

14:55.503 --> 14:57.331
THEN WE CAN USE THAT
TO SCRY FOR THE REAL MAYA.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.376
AND THEN HELPS ME
HOW EXACTLY?

14:59.550 --> 15:01.988
WELL, BECAUSE
WE'LL ORB YOU OUT
AND ORB HER BACK IN.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.554
GET THE REAL KILLER
BEHIND BARS.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.426
PHOEBE, YOU CAN'T ORB ME
OUT OF JAIL!

15:05.600 --> 15:07.341
YEAH, I THINK WE CAN.
IF WE DO IT SIMULTANEOUSLY,

15:07.515 --> 15:08.646
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.

15:08.820 --> 15:09.909
YEAH, AND YOU'VE GOT
YOUR OWN CELL,

15:10.083 --> 15:10.953
SO THERE'S
NO EXPOSURE RISK.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.563
YES, BUT--

15:12.737 --> 15:13.825
Phoebe: NO BUTS!
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

15:14.000 --> 15:15.044
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE NEWSPAPER

15:15.218 --> 15:16.350
AND SEARCH THE ARCHIVES
FOR MAYA.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.307
YOU GO HOME AND LOOK
THROUGH MAGAZINES.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.482
GOT IT.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.136
OH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

15:20.310 --> 15:22.008
I SAW A DOCUMENTARY
ON PRISON ONCE.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.966
YOU'RE GONNA
BE JUST FINE.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.621
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS KEEP YOUR EYES LOW
AND YOUR SHOULDERS HIGH.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.580
WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU OUT
OF THAT UNFLATTERING
COLOR IN NO TIME.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.150
Phoebe: SHOW NO FEAR.

15:40.374 --> 15:44.204
UM, I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE ALONE.

15:44.378 --> 15:48.034
NOW YOU'VE GOT COMPANY.
PLAY NICE.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.647
Guard: KNOCK IT OFF,
JONES!

15:55.911 --> 15:58.131
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?

15:58.305 --> 15:59.436
ME?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.395
I DIDN'T SMILE.

16:01.569 --> 16:02.613
I--I WASN'T LOOKING
AT NOTHIN',

16:02.787 --> 16:03.658
I DIDN'T SMILE
AT NOTHIN',

16:03.832 --> 16:05.007
I'M NOT
DOIN' NOTHIN'.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.271
OK...

16:08.445 --> 16:13.059
[SOFTLY] EYES LOW,
SHOULDERS HIGH.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.061
LEO?

16:15.235 --> 16:16.236
Leo: YOU KNOW,

16:16.410 --> 16:17.454
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.803
I INSIST.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO

16:18.978 --> 16:20.936
SEEING AS HOW MY TOMMY
MADE THE MESS.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.286
ARE YOU SURE THAT UNDERSHIRT
ISN'T DIRTY, TOO?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.158
WHY DON'T WE WASH IT?

16:25.332 --> 16:26.115
UH, YOU KNOW,
I COULD JUST THROW IT
IN THE WASHING MACHINE.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.987
NONSENSE.
HERE, LET ME.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.814
HEY THERE.
EXCUSE ME.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.078
AM I, UM,
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING?

16:32.252 --> 16:33.296
UH--UH--

16:33.470 --> 16:36.430
JO--MMM--EVE, JO,
JENNY'S COUSIN.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.954
SO, UH, LOUIS,

16:39.128 --> 16:40.825
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.184
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

16:51.358 --> 16:53.099
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT AM I DOING, HUH?

16:53.273 --> 16:54.883
I GAVE THE KIDS
SOME SUNDAES

16:55.057 --> 16:56.363
AND EVE'S LITTLE SON TOMMY
SPILT ON ME.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.321
YEAH, WHATEVER.
OK, WHY DON'T YOU

16:58.495 --> 16:59.670
JUST EXPLAIN THAT
TO YOUR WIFE

16:59.844 --> 17:01.281
AFTER WE GET HER
OUT OF JAIL?

17:01.455 --> 17:02.630
JAIL?

17:02.804 --> 17:04.327
MM-HMM. IF YOU WEREN'T
SO BUSY FLIRTING,

17:04.501 --> 17:05.676
MAYBE YOU WOULD KNOW
ABOUT THAT ALREADY.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.157
LOOK, I WASN'T FLIRTING,
OK? IT WAS EVE.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.854
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND, OK?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.595
WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:11.769 --> 17:13.554
WHAT HAPPENED
IS THAT PIPER CHOSE
THE WRONG DISGUISE,

17:13.728 --> 17:14.772
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
SHE FOUND OUT

17:14.946 --> 17:16.644
AFTER SHE WAS ARRESTED
FOR MURDER.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.211
MURDER?

17:18.385 --> 17:19.560
YES, AND APPARENTLY,
SHE THINKS SHE GOT HER ALIAS

17:19.734 --> 17:21.866
OUT OF A PICTURE
IN ONE OF THESE MAGAZINES.

17:22.041 --> 17:22.954
WAIT A SECOND.

17:23.129 --> 17:23.955
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS,

17:24.130 --> 17:25.261
NEITHER DOES PIPER, OK?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.958
SO IF YOU REALLY,
REALLY WANT TO HELP,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.917
MAYBE GO GET RID OF
YOUR LADY FRIEND.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.093
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE IS
NOT MY LADY FRIEND, OK?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.443
SHE'S A FRIEND,
BUT SHE'S JUST A LADY.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.576
WHATEVER. JUST PLEASE
HELP ME FIND MAYA HOLMES.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.794
THE REAL MAYA HOLMES.

17:36.968 --> 17:37.882
WHO?

17:39.014 --> 17:40.407
JUST GO.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.604
OH, SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.823
IS A DEMON PROBLEM?
IS IT, IS IT, IS IT?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.564
NOT NOW, BILLIE.

18:07.738 --> 18:08.696
OH, YOU'RE MAKING A POTION.
IS IT A VANQUISHING POTION?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.654
OH, COME ON, PAIGE,
TEACH ME.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.091
I'M HERE
TO LEARN, AREN'T I?

18:12.265 --> 18:13.527
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM, OK?
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.963
OH, GOOD, GOOD.
I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE BOOK.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.182
I KNOW HOW TO VANQUISH
DEMONS, I KNOW--

18:16.356 --> 18:17.444
IT'S NOT
A DEMON PROBLEM.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.402
WHAT OTHER KIND
OF PROBLEM IS THERE?

18:19.576 --> 18:20.969
IT'S A PIPER'S
IN JAIL PROBLEM.

ON OUR FINGERS, SO...

27:53.976 --> 27:56.631
HMM! THAT'S A GOOD STORY.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.677
NOW GET BACK
INTO POSITION.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.983
WHAT? WHY?

28:01.157 --> 28:02.506
WE GOTTA SAVE MAYA.
WE GOT STUFF TO DO,

28:02.681 --> 28:03.943
SO LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.684
YOU GOTTA GET BACK
INTO POSITION.

28:05.858 --> 28:08.904
[SIGHS] YOU ARE
SO ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

28:09.078 --> 28:09.992
YEAH.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.909
[MUMBLES]

28:17.260 --> 28:18.348
OOH! WOW!

28:18.522 --> 28:19.698
NOW, DON'T YOU
FEEL BETTER?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.874
OK. THANKS FOR
STOPPING BY, CARL.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.833
SAY HI TO EVE
FOR ME, OK?

28:25.007 --> 28:27.183
SEE YOU LATER.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.494
[LAUGHS]

28:38.238 --> 28:41.502
YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?
CANCEL MY SHOW?

28:41.676 --> 28:44.984
WELL, MAYBE NOT CANCEL.
MAYBE JUST POSTPONE?

28:45.158 --> 28:46.899
WHY?

28:47.073 --> 28:48.117
WHY? DID YOU NOT READ
THE ARTICLE

28:48.291 --> 28:49.466
ON EARTHQUAKE
PREPAREDNESS

28:49.640 --> 28:51.381
IN THE NEWSPAPER
TODAY?

28:51.555 --> 28:53.427
I MEAN, WE ARE DUE
FOR A MAJOR SHAKER
AT ANY MOMENT.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.342
ACTUALLY OVERDUE.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.344
A MAJOR SHAKER, HUH?

28:57.518 --> 28:58.911
YES, A MAJOR SHAKER,

28:59.085 --> 29:00.434
AND IMAGINE
WHAT IT WOULD DO
TO YOUR ARTWORK.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.218
IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.264
[CHUCKLES]

29:04.438 --> 29:05.874
I THINK I CAN RISK IT
FOR ONE NIGHT.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.137
NO, YOU CAN'T.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.704
WAIT. YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

29:09.878 --> 29:11.575
YEAH, I'M REALLY
SERIOUS.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.839
JULIE, I CAN'T CANCEL
MY SHOW.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.754
I GOT EVERY MAJOR
ART CRITIC IN TOWN COMING.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.147
IT'S MAKE OR BREAK FOR ME.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.889
OK. THEN IF WE CANNOT
MOVE THE SHOW,

29:21.063 --> 29:22.891
WE'RE GONNA MOVE
YOUR ARTWORK

29:23.065 --> 29:24.458
SO THAT IT'S SAFE,
YOU KNOW?

29:24.632 --> 29:25.459
EASY WITH THAT!

29:25.633 --> 29:26.460
PUT THAT
RIGHT THERE.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.331
GOOD.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.507
AND NOW I'M THINKING
IF WE HAVE SOME, LIKE,
ROPE, YOU KNOW,

29:30.681 --> 29:31.595
AND SOME KRAZY GLUE.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.336
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:33.510 --> 29:34.511
ARE YOU NUTS?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.600
NO. I JUST DON'T
WANT ANYTHING

29:36.775 --> 29:38.951
TO RUIN THE MOMENT
FOR TONIGHT, THAT'S ALL.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.343
[SHAKING AND RUMBLING]

29:40.517 --> 29:42.824
OH, MY GOD!
DID YOU FEEL THAT?

29:42.998 --> 29:44.130
YEAH.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.610
OK! WELL, HURRY UP!
WE GOT WORK TO DO!

29:46.785 --> 29:48.874
WE'LL MOVE THIS ONE
OVER HERE.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.876
I GOT IT.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.750
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET BILLIE DO THIS.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.273
NO, IT'S BETTER
HER GOING IN

29:57.447 --> 29:58.884
TO SEE IF IT'S
SAFE FOR US TO ORB,

29:59.058 --> 30:01.277
ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOU STILL LOOK LIKE MAYA.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.105
BESIDES, IF BILLIE'S
GONNA START HELPING,

30:03.279 --> 30:04.585
SHE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT NOW.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.847
YEAH, BUT
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE

30:06.021 --> 30:09.372
HELPING US
WITH DEMONS,
NOT COPS.

30:09.546 --> 30:10.809
OH, HERE SHE COMES.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.464
HEY, BAD NEWS.
MAYA'S NOT IN THERE.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.988
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE'S NOT IN THERE?

30:16.162 --> 30:17.337
THEY JUST
RELEASED HER INTO
NANCE'S CUSTODY.

30:17.511 --> 30:19.078
NANCE? WHY?

30:19.252 --> 30:22.603
SO HE CAN SHUT HER UP.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.431
YOU SEEMED
SO MUCH MORE
SURE OF YOURSELF

30:24.605 --> 30:26.389
TODAY IN JAIL, MAYA.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.739
NOT SO SURE
OF YOURSELF NOW, ARE YOU?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.219
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:30.393 --> 30:32.482
I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
IN JAIL TODAY.

30:32.656 --> 30:33.962
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW I GOT IN JAIL.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.529
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.270
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO GET CAUGHT.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.620
YOU SAID, I BELIEVE
THE EXACT WORDS WERE,

30:39.794 --> 30:41.317
"SEE YOU IN COURT."

30:41.491 --> 30:43.580
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO THREATEN ME.

30:49.630 --> 30:53.112
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT YOU HAVE ON ME, MAYA?

30:57.116 --> 30:58.900
SEE? I TOLD YOU
HE'D BRING HER HERE.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.555
SO HE CAN'T KILL HER;
EVERYONE KNOWS
HE BAILED HER OUT.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.513
YEAH, WELL,
IF I KNOW NANCE,

31:03.687 --> 31:05.602
HE'S PROBABLY
ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

31:05.776 --> 31:06.821
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
KNOW NANCE?

31:06.995 --> 31:08.040
YOU MET HIM ONCE.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.693
ONCE WAS ENOUGH,
BELIEVE ME.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.912
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.044
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.393
I SWEAR I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING!

31:13.567 --> 31:14.873
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.310
AND I CAN'T RISK IT.

31:17.484 --> 31:20.487
I BEG YOU,
DON'T KILL ME, TOO.

31:20.661 --> 31:24.186
THIS ISN'T MURDER, MAYA.
IT'S SUICIDE.

31:25.535 --> 31:26.623
[GASPS]
OH, MY GOD.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.843
ALLEY. ORB. ORB.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.369
WHEW, THAT
WAS CLOSE.

31:33.543 --> 31:34.501
YEAH.

31:34.675 --> 31:35.806
HURRY, GET THE MATTRESS.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.417
WHAT IF IT
DOESN'T WORK?

31:37.591 --> 31:39.245
WELL, THEN,
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.334
MATTRESS.

31:51.387 --> 31:52.562
WHERE AM I?

31:52.736 --> 31:54.216
YOU'RE DEAD. COME ON.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.706
HERE.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.100
THIS'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

32:08.274 --> 32:12.582
I JUST...I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:12.756 --> 32:13.888
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF--

32:14.062 --> 32:14.976
WITCHES?

32:15.150 --> 32:16.325
OH, COME ON.
SURE YOU HAVE.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.631
IT'S LIKE
THE WIZARD OF OZ.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.241
EXCEPT WE'RE NOT WICKED.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.026
YOU'VE SEEN
THE WIZARD OF OZ,RIGHT?

32:21.200 --> 32:24.377
YEAH, OF COURSE,
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
WITCHES WERE REAL.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.987
REAL ENOUGH TO SAVE YOU.

32:26.161 --> 32:30.252
YOU ACTUALLY
SEEM MORE LIKE
GUARDIAN ANGELS TO ME.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.472
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

32:32.646 --> 32:35.170
I MEAN, I'M ACTUALLY
PRETTY NEW AT THIS MYSELF.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.520
I ONLY MET THE SISTERS--
I MEAN THE COUSINS,

32:37.694 --> 32:38.957
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.567
THEY DO
THIS SORT OF THING
ALL THE TIME.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.829
OR, AT LEAST,
THEY USED TO.

32:42.003 --> 32:45.050
I...I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.616
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.227
ALL THAT MATTERS NOW
IS THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.229
SORRY I KICKED YOU
IN THE FACE.

32:50.403 --> 32:53.275
WELL, I'M SORRY
WE ALMOST GOT YOU KILLED.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.105
HE'S NOT GONNA STOP
COMING AFTER ME, YOU KNOW?

32:57.279 --> 32:59.412
HE'LL FIGURE OUT
I'M ALIVE SOONER OR LATER.

32:59.586 --> 33:00.761
I KNOW,
THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT.

33:00.935 --> 33:01.805
ISN'T THERE
ANY SORT OF PROOF YOU HAVE--

33:01.980 --> 33:03.459
IF I DID,
DON'T YOU THINK

33:03.633 --> 33:04.678
I WOULD'VE
USED IT BY NOW?

33:04.852 --> 33:07.507
I MEAN, WALTER
IS CRAZY. OBSESSED.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.683
HE THINKS
I BETRAYED HIM,
BUT I DIDN'T.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.119
THE ONLY CRIME
I COMMITTED

33:11.293 --> 33:12.599
WAS LEAVING HIM
FOR A YOUNGER MAN.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.209
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:14.383 --> 33:16.472
OH, WALTER
CAN'T STAND THE FACT

33:16.646 --> 33:17.778
THAT HE'S
GETTING OLDER.

33:17.952 --> 33:18.997
HE'S, LIKE,
PARANOID ABOUT IT.

33:19.171 --> 33:20.824
HE DOES
EVERYTHING HE CAN

33:20.999 --> 33:22.261
TO PRETEND
IT'S NOT HAPPENING,

33:22.435 --> 33:25.003
LIKE LIFTS,
BOTOX, IMPLANTS.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.744
HE EVEN HAS A MANICURIST
COME OVER EVERY NIGHT

33:27.918 --> 33:29.268
TO KEEP HIS NAILS
NEAT AND TRIM,

33:29.442 --> 33:32.010
LIKE THAT DOES ANY GOOD.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.926
WHAT IF WE SWAPPED
MAYA'S IDENTITY OUT
FOR A NEW ONE?

33:36.101 --> 33:37.624
ARE YOU KIDDING?

33:37.798 --> 33:40.148
I THINK WE'RE HAVING
ENOUGH IDENTITY
ISSUES AS IT IS.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.803
WELL, WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF
OPTIONS HERE, PEOPLE.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.239
NO, THERE'S GOTTA
BE ANOTHER WAY.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.241
WHAT IF SHE WENT
BACK ON THE RUN?

33:46.415 --> 33:48.026
NO, IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SHE'D GET CAUGHT.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.549
I MEAN, SHE'S
THE PRIME SUSPECT.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.159
YOU CAN'T MAGICALLY
MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.814
EXCUSE ME, GUYS,
BUT I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA.

33:53.988 --> 33:56.817
TOO BAD WE CAN'T PROVE
THAT HE THREW HER
OFF THE BALCONY.

33:56.991 --> 33:57.948
WELL, NOW
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE

33:58.123 --> 33:59.428
SHE ESCAPED
FROM HIM.

33:59.602 --> 34:00.647
AT LEAST,
THAT'S THE WAY
HE'S GONNA SPIN IT.

34:00.821 --> 34:01.996
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
I HAVE A GREAT--

34:02.170 --> 34:04.042
I THINK THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE MAYA

34:04.216 --> 34:06.218
IS TO GET HIM
TO CONFESS TO
THE MURDERS SOMEHOW.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.350
OH, THAT HAPPENS WHEN?
BEFORE OR AFTER
HELL FREEZES OVER.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.222
BUT I'M TELLING YOU--

34:10.396 --> 34:11.875
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT A TRUTH SPELL?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.660
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET CLOSE.

34:13.834 --> 34:14.878
WE COULD TRY ORBING.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.489
OR YOU COULD TRY
LISTENING TO ME!

34:18.143 --> 34:19.274
THANK YOU.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.581
NOW, ACCORDING TO
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS,

34:21.755 --> 34:23.191
THIS WOULD NOT BE
THE FIRST TIME

34:23.365 --> 34:25.585
YOU'VE SCARED
SOMEBODY INTO A
CONFESSION, RIGHT?

34:25.759 --> 34:28.283
6 OR 7 YEARS AGO,
IT WAS THE PAWNBROKER
OR SOMETHING?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.939
WOW. SOMEONE'S DONE
THEIR HOMEWORK.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.897
I'M IMPRESSED.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.639
UH, BUT WE DIDN'T DO IT.
WE GOT A GHOST TO DO IT.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.859
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT YOU GUYS CAN
CHANGE LOOKS, RIGHT?

34:39.033 --> 34:40.730
YOU CAN MAKE HIM
THINK HE'S SEEING
A GHOST.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.297
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

34:44.169 --> 34:48.477
I'M GOING TO
THE DEMON OF FEAR.

34:48.651 --> 34:51.045
YOU WANT US
TO CONJURE BARBAS?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

34:51.219 --> 34:52.351
AFTER EVERYTHING HE DID--

34:52.525 --> 34:53.874
TO KILL YOU?

34:54.048 --> 34:55.397
NO, I'M NOT
SUGGESTING THAT
YOU CONJURE HIM,

34:55.571 --> 34:57.051
I'M JUST SUGGESTING
YOU THINK OF HIM

34:57.225 --> 34:58.487
AS SOME SORT OF
INSPIRATION.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.186
PREY ON NANCE'S
DEEPEST FEAR.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.068
YOU DO VERY NICE WORK.

35:14.242 --> 35:17.071
MUCH BETTER
THAN THE OTHER GIRL.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.552
THANK YOU, SIR.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.510
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HAPPENED TO HER?

35:21.684 --> 35:24.034
SHE'S JUST SICK.
I'M FILLING IN FOR THE DAY.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.299
PERHAPS ON A MORE
PERMANENT BASIS.

35:27.473 --> 35:30.693
OH, I'M SORRY.
I TEND TO WORK WITH
A MUCH YOUNGER CLIENTELE.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.608
OUCH. WATCH IT.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.654
THIN SKIN.

35:34.828 --> 35:35.959
TENDS TO BE
MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE

35:36.134 --> 35:37.613
ON THE HANDS
ON SOMEONE AS OLD AS YOU.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.876
YOU'RE, LIKE,
60, OR SOMETHING?

35:40.050 --> 35:41.051
GET OUT OF HERE.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.314
I AM SO SORRY, SIR.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.142
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO OFFEND YOU.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.534
ARE YOU SENSITIVE
ABOUT YOUR AGE?

35:45.708 --> 35:47.057
NO, I'M NOT!

35:47.232 --> 35:48.624
YOU KNOW, I CAN USUALLY
TELL HOW OLD SOMEONE IS

35:48.798 --> 35:50.148
JUST BY LOOKING AT
THE LINES ON THEIR HANDS.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.932
GO AHEAD,
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.282
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

35:59.548 --> 36:00.375
WHAT?!

36:00.549 --> 36:01.811
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

36:05.337 --> 36:06.512
WHAT THE HELL?

36:06.686 --> 36:09.210
YOU'RE DEAD!

36:09.384 --> 36:10.342
YOU COULDN'T HAVE--

36:10.516 --> 36:13.258
LIVED? SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.303
AAH!

36:23.964 --> 36:25.183
OH!

36:27.924 --> 36:30.666
AAH!

36:30.840 --> 36:34.148
WHAT'S THE MATTER OLD MAN,
SEEING A GHOST?

36:34.322 --> 36:35.236
BECAUSE YOU
KILLED ME?

36:35.410 --> 36:36.542
JUST LIKE
YOU KILLED CURTIS?

36:36.716 --> 36:38.805
NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

36:38.979 --> 36:39.980
IT'S...IT'S A--

36:40.154 --> 36:41.155
A NIGHTMARE?

36:41.329 --> 36:42.504
ONE YOU WON'T EVER
WAKE UP FROM.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.637
