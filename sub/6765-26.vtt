WEBVTT

00:02.397 --> 00:06.526
Flight 62 from Los Angeles
is now landing.

00:06.567 --> 00:07.533
Excuse me, man.

00:07.568 --> 00:09.228
l'm sorry, l'm in a hurry.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.074

00:19.646 --> 00:20.703
Donna.

00:20.747 --> 00:23.408
Ray, hi.

00:23.450 --> 00:25.576
Oh, they're beautiful.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.483
l can't believe how
much l missed you.

00:33.559 --> 00:35.025
Ray.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.425
How's it going?

00:37.463 --> 00:39.487
lt was going just fine.

00:39.531 --> 00:40.622
What's he doing here?

00:40.665 --> 00:41.995
Oh, it's not what you think.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.727
My mom lives out here.
So, l thought l'd surprise her.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.858
Well, l'm surprised.

00:44.903 --> 00:47.234
Was this the only flight
you could catch?

00:47.272 --> 00:48.670
Come on, we got
a bargain rate.

00:48.706 --> 00:50.297
You know, two for
the price of one.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.306
Great deal.

00:51.341 --> 00:52.466
Ray, mellow out,
okay?

00:52.509 --> 00:53.998
Look, l'm not here
to get in your way.

00:54.044 --> 00:55.203
You won't even know l'm in town.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.643
Well, let's go get
our bags, yeah?

00:59.683 --> 01:01.650
Sure.

01:01.684 --> 01:03.412
Welcome to Portland.

02:07.745 --> 02:09.336
You know, l definitely think

02:09.380 --> 02:11.142
you need to go with
a little air valve

02:11.182 --> 02:12.773
right on the side
of your head there.

02:12.816 --> 02:15.283
Are you going to make me
sorry l asked you to come?

02:15.318 --> 02:17.615
Well, l don't want you to think
l'm encouraging this, okay?

02:17.654 --> 02:19.018
Well, l'm not asking
for your permission.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.545
l just want your
artistic opinion.

02:21.591 --> 02:23.217
l mean, some men think that

02:23.260 --> 02:26.251
tattoos create a ''sensual
mystique'' about a woman.

02:26.295 --> 02:28.694
Yeah, and some men don't.

02:28.797 --> 02:31.697
And trust me, you've
got plenty of mystique.

02:31.767 --> 02:32.892
Look, Dylan,

02:32.935 --> 02:34.231
l'm getting this tattoo.

02:34.270 --> 02:35.497
l mean, you're just cranky

02:35.537 --> 02:36.696
because you don't like
Charley's script.

02:36.771 --> 02:37.930
Oh, hey, l like the script.

02:37.972 --> 02:39.199
l just think when your...

02:39.240 --> 02:41.673
when your main character
believes in reincarnation,

02:41.709 --> 02:45.075
that presents a little bit
of a credibility problem.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.273
Well, if you feel
so strongly about this,

02:47.315 --> 02:48.906
why are you going to
see his hypnotherapist?

02:48.949 --> 02:50.575
Hey, l'm doing
a little research.

02:50.617 --> 02:53.779
You are having a fashion
statement etched into your skin.

02:57.824 --> 02:59.450
Do you think it hurts?

02:59.493 --> 03:01.084
What, that? No! What,
are you kidding me?

03:01.127 --> 03:03.617
l mean, look, l knew a pool
shark friend of mine,

03:03.663 --> 03:04.924
he passed out once,
but you...

03:04.964 --> 03:06.760
you're a lot tougher
than she was.

03:06.799 --> 03:10.234
So, you got a solid vibe
from anything here yet?

03:10.269 --> 03:12.998
Bold graphic?
Color? Fine line?

03:13.038 --> 03:15.232
What do you see?

03:15.273 --> 03:17.672
Well, call me indecisive,

03:17.709 --> 03:21.235
but, um, l'm not quite sure
on the design yet.

03:21.279 --> 03:23.246
l think l should sleep on it.

03:25.316 --> 03:28.307
She's a, uh, chicken.

03:28.352 --> 03:29.909
She'll be back.

04:16.161 --> 04:17.458
Hi.

04:17.497 --> 04:18.463
Hello.

04:18.498 --> 04:19.521
Look, l was wondering

04:19.565 --> 04:20.759
if you could do me a favor.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.198
My name is David Silver,

04:22.235 --> 04:23.929
and l know you're supposed
to buzz people in and all,

04:23.969 --> 04:25.230
but, um, well, l'm here
to visit my mom,

04:25.270 --> 04:26.600
and l kind of wanted
to surprise her.

04:26.638 --> 04:28.571
Sure. What's your mother's name?

04:28.607 --> 04:31.131
Sheila Silver.

04:31.176 --> 04:32.972
l don't see it.

04:33.012 --> 04:35.343
You know what, it might be
under her maiden name--

04:35.380 --> 04:36.641
Matthews, Sheila Matthews.

04:36.681 --> 04:40.172
We have a couple of Matthews--
Jim, Harold.

04:40.218 --> 04:41.445
No Sheila, though.

04:41.486 --> 04:44.943
She works for, uh, uh,
McPherson, in accounting.

04:44.989 --> 04:46.114
Scott McPherson?

04:46.156 --> 04:47.645
-Yes, that's him.
-He's on the tenth floor.

04:47.691 --> 04:49.282
l'll call him for you
if you like.

04:49.326 --> 04:51.225
Thank you so much.

04:51.261 --> 04:52.693
Dude, l liked your mother.

04:52.796 --> 04:55.389
She was a very funny lady
when she wanted to be.

04:55.432 --> 04:56.557
And talented.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.362
You should have heard
her play the piano

04:58.401 --> 04:59.389
at our Christmas party.

04:59.435 --> 05:01.368
So what happened?

05:01.404 --> 05:04.236
l just don't think your mom was
cut out to be a nine-to-fiver.

05:04.273 --> 05:06.570
Yeah, well, she never
had to work before.

05:06.609 --> 05:07.870
She always had money.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.900
She didn't show up
on time very much.

05:09.944 --> 05:11.570
Some days, not at all.

05:11.613 --> 05:12.806
Personnel had no choice.

05:12.847 --> 05:15.610
l'm sorry.

05:15.650 --> 05:19.881
When you see her...
send her my best.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.080
Yeah, l will.

05:21.122 --> 05:23.055
l'm going to see
her right now. Thanks.

06:01.659 --> 06:04.491
l'm sorry, l, uh, l must
have the wrong apartment.

06:04.528 --> 06:06.051
ls there something
we can help you with?

06:06.097 --> 06:07.961
l thought this was
my mom's apartment.

06:07.998 --> 06:09.521
Sheila Silver.

06:09.566 --> 06:13.729
See, l'm up here from L.A.,
and... l'm sure this was it.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.430
She must have been
a previous tenant.

06:15.472 --> 06:17.200
You know, we just
moved in last week.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.764
You wouldn't happen to have a
forwarding address, would you?

06:19.809 --> 06:21.901
No, but you might try the
manager. He's down in 1-A.

06:21.944 --> 06:23.968
Great, thanks.

06:26.648 --> 06:28.046
Excuse me, are you the manager?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.413
Sorry, no vacancies.

06:29.451 --> 06:31.042
No, l'm not looking
for an apartment.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.553
l'm looking for my mother,
Sheila Silver.

06:33.588 --> 06:36.556
She lived in 3-G.

06:36.591 --> 06:37.887
Good luck.

06:37.925 --> 06:40.017
l've been looking for her
for two months now.

06:40.061 --> 06:42.051
l don't understand.

06:42.096 --> 06:43.119
She skipped out.

06:43.164 --> 06:44.391
Owes four month's back rent.

06:44.431 --> 06:47.763
No, there must be
some mistake.

06:47.801 --> 06:49.358
There's no mistake.

06:49.402 --> 06:50.663
Your mother's a deadbeat.

06:50.704 --> 06:52.295
And from the stack of bills
that keep coming here,

06:52.339 --> 06:53.771
l'm not the only one
she stiffed.

06:53.807 --> 06:55.171
So you don't know
where she is?

06:55.208 --> 06:56.265
Hey, if l knew that,

06:56.308 --> 06:58.832
l'd be slapping her
with a lawsuit.

06:58.878 --> 07:02.745
Do me a favor, if you find her,
tell her she owes me two grand.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.926
35 bucks, sir.

07:30.107 --> 07:32.404
Hey, l was beginning
to give up on you.

07:32.441 --> 07:35.341
Come on in.

07:35.378 --> 07:38.005
So, you actually stayed
here during the fire, yes?

07:38.047 --> 07:41.140
Oh, yeah, through the
mudslides, the earthquake.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.741
Wow, you deserve
a medal of honor

07:42.785 --> 07:44.308
from the Malibu
Homeowners Association.

07:44.352 --> 07:45.648
You know, l don't think

07:45.687 --> 07:46.880
l'd really want to live
anywhere else.

07:46.922 --> 07:48.388
The whole neighborhood's
trashed.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.117
How come this place
is still standing?

07:50.158 --> 07:53.183
Yeah, well, it was a combination
of luck and fate.

07:53.228 --> 07:54.785
Luck, heard about it.

07:54.829 --> 07:56.659
Why don't you tell me
about the fate part?

07:56.730 --> 07:58.594
Would you like a cup of tea?

07:58.632 --> 07:59.825
What do l have?

07:59.867 --> 08:01.891
l have chamomile,
peppermint, lemon zinger.

08:01.936 --> 08:03.596
Sure, zing me.

08:03.671 --> 08:06.036
You didn't tell
about the fate part.

08:06.073 --> 08:08.597
Charley warned me
that you were a skeptic.

08:08.708 --> 08:10.607
So you're not
going to tell me?

08:10.643 --> 08:12.906
l will, l will, but you have
to promise me something.

08:12.946 --> 08:15.379
Promise me that you're not gonna
go running after that taxi cab

08:15.415 --> 08:17.245
when l tell you this--

08:17.283 --> 08:20.479
this is not the first time
l have survived a fire.

08:20.519 --> 08:22.986
You talking about
another lifetime?

08:23.021 --> 08:25.386
A few other lifetimes.

08:25.424 --> 08:26.754
Look, l want to help Charley

08:26.792 --> 08:29.453
get this thing past the
script form, okay?

08:29.494 --> 08:31.620
But every time he writes a scene
where our hero's thinking about

08:31.729 --> 08:34.128
the boots he wore in the first
crusade, it drives me crazy.

08:34.164 --> 08:35.461
lt isn't marketable,

08:35.499 --> 08:36.965
and the audience is gonna
think that we're nuts.

08:37.001 --> 08:39.366
You know l gotta
tell you something,

08:39.403 --> 08:42.200
you sound exactly like where
l was at a couple of years ago.

08:42.239 --> 08:43.568
You mean to tell me

08:43.607 --> 08:45.631
you weren't always the
all knowing guru of Malibu?

08:45.742 --> 08:48.039
Ha! No, l used to be
a very successful

08:48.078 --> 08:51.103
advertising executive
in Orange County.

08:51.147 --> 08:54.638
But... one day somebody
hypnotized me,

08:54.683 --> 08:57.082
and... l gotta tell you

08:57.119 --> 09:01.418
it was like, boom-- this... this
whole new journey began for me.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.481
l'm not ready to take a journey.

09:03.525 --> 09:05.492
That's okay.

09:05.527 --> 09:07.551
The truth is, l've been
channeling travelers

09:07.595 --> 09:09.118
for 500 years.

09:09.163 --> 09:12.029
l can wait.

09:18.205 --> 09:20.172
So, tell me you
changed your mind;

09:20.207 --> 09:21.605
you're going to let me
rip off all your clothes

09:21.708 --> 09:23.174
and make love
to you all night.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.609
Mm, shut up and kiss me.

09:25.712 --> 09:27.338
Should l take
that as a yes?

09:27.381 --> 09:29.348
You didn't invite me
all the way up here

09:29.383 --> 09:32.351
to spend the weekend
in bed, did you?

09:32.385 --> 09:34.352
Well, the thought
crossed my mind, but no,

09:34.387 --> 09:36.854
l actually made plans
to leave this room.

09:36.889 --> 09:39.948
This city is full of cool
little coffee bars and clubs,

09:39.992 --> 09:41.288
and the people
here are mellow.

09:41.326 --> 09:43.190
lt's not like L.A. at all.

09:43.228 --> 09:47.288
Mm, cool, but, uh, we don't have
to leave just yet, do we?

09:49.367 --> 09:50.492
l missed you.

09:50.535 --> 09:53.332
l almost forgot
how good you feel.

09:55.339 --> 09:57.898
Come back later.
We're busy.

09:57.941 --> 10:01.535
lt's me. lt's David.

10:01.578 --> 10:02.635
David?

10:02.680 --> 10:04.306
You told him where
we were staying?

10:04.348 --> 10:06.212
lt's not like it was
a secret or anything.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.647
l knew this was
going to happen.

10:07.684 --> 10:08.741
No, Ray...

10:08.785 --> 10:10.217
Look, just get rid of him.

10:20.128 --> 10:23.290
Look, Donna, l'm sorry,
l don't know where else to go.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.821
What's wrong?

10:24.866 --> 10:27.834
lt's my mother.

10:27.869 --> 10:30.302
David, what's the matter?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.362
l can't find her.

10:32.406 --> 10:33.929
She got fired from her job,

10:33.974 --> 10:36.339
l went to her apartment; she
doesn't even live there anymore.

10:36.377 --> 10:39.004
Look at this.
Wait till you see this.

10:39.046 --> 10:42.208
Mail from months ago.

10:42.248 --> 10:44.044
Alimony checks from my father,

10:44.084 --> 10:45.448
she hasn't even cashed them.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.042
Wait, wait. lf her alimony
checks hadn't been cashed,

10:47.087 --> 10:48.678
don't you think your dad
would have noticed?

10:48.788 --> 10:52.883
l don't know, l can't
figure any of this out.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.222
When was the last time
you talked to her?

10:55.260 --> 10:56.988
Christmas Eve. She was fine.

10:57.029 --> 10:58.518
You haven't talked

10:58.564 --> 11:00.497
to your mother
since Christmas?

11:02.067 --> 11:04.000
We're not very close.

11:04.035 --> 11:05.626
Guess not.

11:05.703 --> 11:07.636
Look, l'm...

11:07.705 --> 11:10.138
l'm sorry for laying all this
on you guys, all right?

11:10.174 --> 11:11.572
No, no, it's okay.
You know what?

11:11.609 --> 11:13.007
We're gonna get you a room,

11:13.044 --> 11:14.772
and we're gonna figure
this out, aren't we, Ray?

11:14.812 --> 11:15.903
Do whatever you want.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.209
l got to go to the club
for a sound check.

11:18.248 --> 11:20.545
l'll meet you there.
ls that okay?

11:20.584 --> 11:22.244
Do l have any other choice?

11:28.157 --> 11:30.124
Look, um, l'll be right back.

11:30.159 --> 11:31.648
Stay here, okay?

11:33.262 --> 11:34.785
Ray, wait a second.

11:34.830 --> 11:36.797
Look, l'm really sorry
about all this,

11:36.832 --> 11:38.628
but what else
am l supposed to do?

11:38.667 --> 11:40.395
Why did he have to
tag along, anyway?

11:40.435 --> 11:42.231
l told you,
he came to see his mom.

11:42.270 --> 11:44.635
Donna, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

11:44.672 --> 11:46.536
l know, l know, and l'm sorry.

11:46.574 --> 11:48.939
Look, if we could drop
you off at the club

11:48.977 --> 11:50.341
and borrow your truck,

11:50.378 --> 11:52.345
it would be a lot easier
to track her down.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.675
No, he can rent a car.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.544
-Ray...
-Hey, he can afford it.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.481
Well, thanks for your help.

11:57.518 --> 11:59.678
Look, don't make me out to be
the bad guy here, all right?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.879
l just want to be with you.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.081
l know.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.352
Look, l'll be there
as quick as l can, okay?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.373
l heard what happened
out there in the hall.

12:23.408 --> 12:25.967
Eh, don't worry about it--
he'll get over it.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.843
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

12:28.879 --> 12:30.869
Yeah, maybe.

12:33.184 --> 12:35.014
You two got l.D.?

12:35.052 --> 12:36.348
No, sir.
We're not here to drink.

12:36.387 --> 12:38.752
l'm looking for somebody
who used to come in here a lot.

12:40.023 --> 12:41.580
Oh, yeah,
we sent these out

12:41.624 --> 12:43.454
to our regulars
for Valentine's Day.

12:43.493 --> 12:45.392
Well, then you may know
who l'm looking for.

12:45.428 --> 12:46.621
Her name is Sheila Silver.

12:46.663 --> 12:48.596
Sheila.

12:48.631 --> 12:50.063
Oh, yeah. Sheila.

12:50.099 --> 12:52.066
She's my mother.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.191
Sheila's your mom?

12:53.235 --> 12:54.826
Yeah, l guess
you kind of look like her.

12:54.870 --> 12:56.097
Well, have you seen her lately?

12:56.138 --> 12:57.104
Oh, not in a while.

12:57.139 --> 12:58.332
Hell of a gal, though.

12:58.373 --> 13:00.704
Hey, kid. Come here.

13:05.813 --> 13:07.211
l know Sheila Silver.

13:07.248 --> 13:09.112
l saw her just last week.

13:09.150 --> 13:10.241
Where?

13:13.987 --> 13:15.613
l think he wants you
to buy him a drink.

13:15.655 --> 13:16.780
Yeah.

13:16.823 --> 13:18.813
Uh, bartender,
could you help this man out?

13:18.859 --> 13:21.383
Well, thank you kindly, son.

13:21.428 --> 13:23.054
So where'd you see my mom?

13:23.096 --> 13:25.495
She was setting up shop
at the Reno Hotel.

13:25.532 --> 13:26.828
ls that far from here?

13:26.866 --> 13:29.129
Couple of blocks--
it's on Clancy Street.

13:29.168 --> 13:30.293
-Thank you
-Wait-wait-wait,

13:30.336 --> 13:31.927
what do you mean,
''setting up shop''?

13:41.746 --> 13:43.610
Let's go.

13:43.648 --> 13:44.909
What'd you find out?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.940
She lived here, all right--
till she was arrested

13:47.986 --> 13:50.954
for disorderly conduct
and public drunkenness.

13:50.988 --> 13:54.252
Your mother was arrested?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.656
l can't believe
this is happening.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.353
l mean, my mom was
the type of woman

13:59.396 --> 14:01.659
who used to wear Chanel suits
to Little League games.

14:01.697 --> 14:05.530
l mean... what would
make her sink so low?

14:05.568 --> 14:08.730
You'd better call your dad.

14:11.841 --> 14:14.001
lt's gonna be okay.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.628
Well, my dad said
he'll be here tomorrow.

14:35.696 --> 14:37.390
-Good.
-Yeah,

14:37.430 --> 14:38.987
l guess so.

14:39.032 --> 14:42.523
Whenever it comes to my mom,
he always... gets weird.

14:42.569 --> 14:43.967
-What do you mean?
-Well, l don't know,

14:44.003 --> 14:45.765
l told him everything
that's going on,

14:45.805 --> 14:48.136
and he... he didn't
even sound surprised.

14:48.174 --> 14:49.504
Here.

14:49.541 --> 14:52.304
l just got this from the lab--
maybe this'll help.

14:52.344 --> 14:54.607
We can't do anything

14:54.646 --> 14:56.613
until your mom's been missing
for 48 hours.

14:56.648 --> 14:57.944
What are you
talking about?

14:57.983 --> 14:59.006
She hasn't even
picked up her mail

14:59.051 --> 15:00.017
-in three months.
-l know.

15:00.052 --> 15:01.416
But you just reported it.

15:01.452 --> 15:04.386
We have to wait the full 48 till
we can do anything official.

15:04.422 --> 15:05.979
l don't understand,
you guys arrested her

15:06.023 --> 15:07.922
six weeks ago--
why'd you let her go?

15:07.959 --> 15:09.323
Why didn't you
call her family?

15:09.360 --> 15:10.587
That's not our responsibility.

15:10.695 --> 15:12.753
She could have called
anyone she wanted.

15:12.796 --> 15:14.023
Besides, we booked her,

15:14.064 --> 15:15.553
the victim never
pressed charges,

15:15.599 --> 15:17.088
so it didn't
matter anyway.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.157
Yeah, it didn't matter to you.

15:19.202 --> 15:20.896
Now, look,

15:20.937 --> 15:22.528
l know this is rough.

15:22.572 --> 15:24.266
Have you checked the shelters?

15:24.306 --> 15:25.294
Not yet.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.773
l would if l were you.

15:26.809 --> 15:28.298
Good luck, son.

15:31.413 --> 15:33.437
lt's almost 9:00.
You'd better go.

15:33.482 --> 15:34.948
Ray's gonna be
going on soon.

15:34.984 --> 15:37.042
Oh, my God,
l forgot all about him.

15:37.085 --> 15:38.051
l should call him.

15:38.086 --> 15:39.279
Donna, just go.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.584
All right? l don't want
to get between you two.

15:42.624 --> 15:45.023
Are you kidding? l'm not
gonna let you out of my sight

15:45.059 --> 15:46.548
at a time like this.

15:46.594 --> 15:48.390
He'll understand.

15:48.428 --> 15:50.361
Look, you promised
you'd be here.

15:50.397 --> 15:51.886
Look, we still haven't
found David's mother.

15:51.932 --> 15:53.023
We got to keep looking.

15:53.066 --> 15:54.191
Well, you're gonna
miss the show!

15:56.503 --> 15:59.767
l'm sorry, l'll be there
as soon as l can.

15:59.805 --> 16:02.136
No, forget it, all right?
l'll see you back at the motel.

16:02.174 --> 16:05.233
Ray...

16:21.960 --> 16:23.051
Hi.

16:23.093 --> 16:24.059
Hi.

16:24.094 --> 16:25.390
Can l help you?

16:25.429 --> 16:27.157
Yeah, l'm, uh...

16:27.197 --> 16:30.222
l'm, l'm looking
for my mother.

16:30.267 --> 16:33.565
l don't recognize her, but then
the faces here change nightly.

16:33.604 --> 16:35.468
You can walk through
if you like.

16:35.505 --> 16:36.869
Maybe you'll get lucky.

16:36.906 --> 16:38.167
Great. Thanks.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.798
Sure.

17:22.146 --> 17:23.579
Sorry.

17:23.682 --> 17:24.875
l'm sorry.

17:44.102 --> 17:45.728
l feel so guilty.

17:45.769 --> 17:47.463
Why?

17:47.504 --> 17:50.472
My mom must've asked me
a million times to come

17:50.507 --> 17:51.598
and visit her.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.039
l blew her off every time.

17:54.077 --> 17:57.307
l made excuses or promises,
but l never came.

17:57.347 --> 18:00.315
Don't blame yourself.

18:00.349 --> 18:03.840
Look at her face-- she looks
like she's aged ten years

18:03.886 --> 18:06.183
since she left L.A.

18:06.222 --> 18:07.449
Why'd she come up here, anyway?

18:07.490 --> 18:08.456
l don't know.

18:08.491 --> 18:09.787
She said she wanted to make

18:09.824 --> 18:12.189
a fresh start, but, uh, l know

18:12.227 --> 18:14.353
she was really just trying
to get away from my father.

18:14.395 --> 18:15.452
Yeah, but why Portland?

18:15.497 --> 18:17.555
l mean, does she
know anyone up here?

18:17.665 --> 18:19.962
Not a soul.

18:20.001 --> 18:22.059
Before she left,
she told me that

18:22.102 --> 18:24.296
she was tired of
pretending to be happy

18:24.338 --> 18:25.429
in the sunshine.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.735
She thought the rain
better suited her mood.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.435
The truth is,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.500
l was kind of relieved
when she left.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.944
Figured l wouldn't have
to deal with her anymore.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.272
l'd give anything
to hear her voice right now.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.012
We'll find her.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.883
l know we will.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.482
We'd, uh, better
get going.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.754
We have a long
night ahead of us.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.796
l think you ought to
get a snake,

18:52.831 --> 18:54.024
have it start
right about here,

18:54.065 --> 18:55.554
coil its way down like this,

18:55.600 --> 18:56.930
have a dragon's head
pop up right off

18:56.967 --> 18:58.991
the right cheek of your
butt, all the way down

18:59.036 --> 19:01.936
to there, and then right here
on the thigh: ''Born to lose.''

19:01.972 --> 19:03.063
What do you think?

19:03.107 --> 19:04.539
Would you stop making fun of me?

19:04.642 --> 19:06.506
l can't help it--
it's so stupid.

19:06.544 --> 19:08.272
l... Listen, l am serious here!

19:08.312 --> 19:09.676
l know, you're
seriously ill.

19:09.712 --> 19:11.406
Anybody that would
permanently scar their body

19:11.447 --> 19:12.879
needs to have their
head examined.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.076
Well, you know what,
if l get my tattoo,

19:15.118 --> 19:16.812
you don't have to look at it.

19:16.853 --> 19:18.319
You won't do it.

19:18.354 --> 19:19.877
You want to bet?

19:19.923 --> 19:22.356
You know, you are
crazier than l am.

19:22.391 --> 19:24.290
l can't believe you're gonna let
that nutcase hypnotize you.

19:24.326 --> 19:25.485
Hey, it's just the one time,

19:25.527 --> 19:26.993
it doesn't leave any marks,
and besides,

19:27.029 --> 19:29.087
it's not like l'm making
a lifestyle choice here, okay?

19:29.131 --> 19:30.995
l'm just doing it for
Charley's movie, that's it.

19:31.033 --> 19:32.397
You know, at this very second,

19:32.433 --> 19:34.627
you and your mother
have so much in common.

19:36.504 --> 19:38.334
You know what l'm gonna
get you for your birthday?

19:38.372 --> 19:39.463
Hmm?

19:39.507 --> 19:40.973
l'm gonna get you
this big crystal,

19:41.008 --> 19:43.373
and we're gonna hang it
right here on your neck,

19:43.411 --> 19:45.037
and you can rub it
before you go to sleep.

19:45.078 --> 19:47.409
No, no. l think l would rather
rub you. Here's what you do.

19:47.447 --> 19:48.913
l think you should
get Aladdin's lamp

19:48.949 --> 19:50.415
tattooed on you
right about here.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.246
That way, l can kind of rub it
and make the genie pop out.

19:52.285 --> 19:53.444
Well, you've already
done that.

19:53.486 --> 19:54.782
That's why
l keep coming back.

19:54.821 --> 19:55.787
Oh, really?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.219
Why are you so cruel to me?

19:57.256 --> 19:58.415
l don't know... Aah!

20:05.698 --> 20:07.790
Please don't be mad.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.991
Why the hell shouldn't l be?!

20:09.033 --> 20:10.397
l spent all night
waiting for you!

20:10.435 --> 20:12.061
l played two sets.

20:12.103 --> 20:13.592
l told everybody
you were coming.

20:13.638 --> 20:14.899
Where the hell were you?

20:14.939 --> 20:17.600
You know where l was.

20:17.642 --> 20:20.872
l was helping one of my
best friends find his mother.

20:20.911 --> 20:22.969
Ray, put yourself in his shoes.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.775
Yeah, well, life's a bitch.

20:26.183 --> 20:30.983
l... l can't believe
you can be so heartless.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.954
lf LuAnn had one
of her drunken binges,

20:32.989 --> 20:34.853
and she was lying
somewhere in the gutter,

20:34.891 --> 20:37.415
what-what would you do,
just leave her there?

20:37.460 --> 20:38.892
Hey, leave my mother
out of this!

20:40.196 --> 20:43.562
Look, all l'm saying is,
David needs me right now.

20:43.598 --> 20:45.792
l can't turn my back on him.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.635
Look, he saved my life--
l'm not gonna desert him.

20:49.704 --> 20:51.136
Fine. He needs you so much,

20:51.172 --> 20:53.036
he's right across the hall.

20:53.074 --> 20:54.233
Go sleep with him.

20:54.276 --> 20:56.209
How can you say that to me?

20:56.243 --> 20:58.938
Oh, right, l forgot--
you don't sleep with anybody.

20:58.979 --> 21:01.606
You know what? l'm leaving.

21:01.649 --> 21:04.515
You're not going anywhere
until l tell you you can.

21:05.886 --> 21:08.410
l'm getting out of here.

21:08.454 --> 21:10.284
-Ow!
-Donna,

21:10.323 --> 21:11.584
look, l'm sorry,
that was an accident.

21:11.691 --> 21:12.418
l didn't...

21:13.326 --> 21:15.589
Don't touch me!

21:15.662 --> 21:16.992
Donna, come on!

21:23.335 --> 21:24.665
Damn.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.845
Can l talk to Donna?

21:35.880 --> 21:36.846
Yeah. Go ahead.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.211
She's in the bathroom.

21:43.019 --> 21:45.680
Hey, Donna, will you come
out of there, please?

21:48.358 --> 21:50.518
So, what happened
between you two?

21:50.560 --> 21:51.753
What'd she say?

21:51.795 --> 21:53.159
She didn't say anything.

21:53.196 --> 21:55.288
She came in here crying and
locked herself in the john.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.202
What's this?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.567
lt's the keys to my truck.

22:03.639 --> 22:05.936
You guys can use
it in the morning.

22:05.974 --> 22:08.203
You got a lot of ground
to cover in this city.

22:08.242 --> 22:09.572
Thanks.

22:14.582 --> 22:17.141
Ray.

22:17.185 --> 22:18.481
Look, man, none of this

22:18.518 --> 22:19.814
was Donna's fault.

22:19.853 --> 22:22.013
Believe me, l wasn't
trying to get in your way.

22:22.055 --> 22:26.013
Hey, there's a lot
of history between you two.

22:26.059 --> 22:28.117
Yeah. lt was a long time ago.

22:28.161 --> 22:32.096
Well, there's a, uh, map of the
city in the glove compartment.

22:32.131 --> 22:33.324
Thanks a lot.

22:39.071 --> 22:40.560
Donna!

22:40.606 --> 22:42.800
Hey, uh...

22:42.841 --> 22:44.603
Uh, Ray's letting us
use his truck.

22:46.678 --> 22:49.669
Good night, David.
Try to get some sleep, okay?

22:50.715 --> 22:52.079
You, too.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.128
Look, Donna, l'm so sorry.

23:06.162 --> 23:07.560
l know.

23:07.630 --> 23:10.792
l would never do
anything to hurt you.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.561
You gotta believe that.

23:14.303 --> 23:15.963
l do.

23:16.005 --> 23:20.373
l just love you so much, and l
thought that l was losing you.

23:20.409 --> 23:22.933
No.

23:22.978 --> 23:24.308
l love you.

24:04.282 --> 24:05.839
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey.

24:05.883 --> 24:07.474
-Hi, Mel.
-Hi, Donna.

24:08.953 --> 24:10.544
How're you holding up?

24:10.655 --> 24:12.554
We've looked everywhere.

24:12.623 --> 24:14.249
l don't know if she's
still in Portland.

24:14.292 --> 24:15.918
l don't know if she's,
uh, still alive.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.550
Knowing Sheila, she's probably

24:17.627 --> 24:18.991
in some Chinese
restaurant somewhere,

24:19.029 --> 24:21.758
having some moo shu
and wondering what

24:21.798 --> 24:22.957
all the fuss was about. Donna,

24:22.999 --> 24:24.329
David told me
how wonderful you've been.

24:24.367 --> 24:26.061
l don't know how to thank you.

24:26.103 --> 24:27.865
You two get the bags.
l'll get the truck,

24:27.903 --> 24:29.369
and l'll meet you
out front, okay?

24:29.405 --> 24:30.371
Thanks.

24:30.406 --> 24:31.736
Thanks.

24:33.275 --> 24:35.936
So, the cops say Mom's crazy.

24:38.848 --> 24:40.815
David, sit down for a minute.

24:48.656 --> 24:51.954
l don't quite know
where to start, but...

24:51.992 --> 24:54.858
your mom had been diagnosed
as a manic depressive.

24:54.895 --> 24:57.294
She's been on a drug
called lithium

24:57.331 --> 24:59.855
since you were a little boy.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.464
So, are you telling me that,
uh, she's mentally ill?

25:07.807 --> 25:08.932
Yeah.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.535
How come nobody ever
told me this before?

25:13.613 --> 25:14.909
David, you were a little kid.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.537
l couldn't exactly
put you on my knee

25:16.615 --> 25:19.242
and say, ''Davy, your
mother is flipping out.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.547
There's a long history of
mental illness in her family.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.484
Now, get your teddy
bear and go to bed.''

25:23.522 --> 25:24.886
Yeah, we'll l haven't
been a little kid

25:24.923 --> 25:26.287
for quite some time
now, Dad. l mean,

25:26.324 --> 25:27.881
you could've told me
a lot sooner than this.

25:27.925 --> 25:30.722
l'm sorry.

25:30.761 --> 25:32.955
l should have told you.
l wanted to.

25:34.498 --> 25:36.465
But your mom never
wanted you to know.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.557
Why not?

25:37.668 --> 25:40.261
David, the hardest thing
for any parent to do

25:40.303 --> 25:42.327
is to tell their child
that they're falling apart.

25:44.641 --> 25:46.801
This doesn't even sound like
we're talking about Mom.

25:46.843 --> 25:49.470
l mean, it sounds like...

25:49.512 --> 25:52.480
like we're talking about
some complete stranger.

25:56.852 --> 25:59.411
Your mother was...

25:59.454 --> 26:01.284
She always had,
a lot of self-control.

26:01.323 --> 26:04.086
She took her lithium
every day, even though

26:04.125 --> 26:05.921
she hated the cure
more than the disease.

26:05.960 --> 26:10.896
And then that summer that you
went away to Camp Hess Kramer...

26:10.932 --> 26:12.364
she stopped taking the pills,

26:12.400 --> 26:14.663
and within a week,
she was high as a kite.

26:14.701 --> 26:19.433
She spent $20,000
on Rodeo Drive in one afternoon.

26:19.472 --> 26:22.531
When l found out about it,

26:22.609 --> 26:24.542
l tried to stop her,
and she went ballistic.

26:24.611 --> 26:26.805
She broke all the
china in the house,

26:26.845 --> 26:29.540
and then she crashed.

26:29.615 --> 26:31.241
And then you came home,

26:31.283 --> 26:33.477
and it was as if
nothing happened.

26:34.687 --> 26:37.814
l'm sorry to lay all
this on you at once.

26:40.625 --> 26:44.788
Dad, she hasn't cashed her
alimony checks in months.

26:44.829 --> 26:47.490
l mean, didn't you think that
maybe something was wrong?

26:49.633 --> 26:51.998
l was hoping that
she had found

26:52.035 --> 26:54.935
somebody else to
take care of her.

26:54.972 --> 26:58.031
l just didn't want to
get sucked in again,

26:58.075 --> 27:00.167
after it took so much
for me to pull away.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.139
So what do we do now?

27:05.581 --> 27:07.741
We pray to God that we find her,

27:07.783 --> 27:09.147
and we get her some help.

27:14.122 --> 27:16.351
Okay, just pick a spot
on the wall back there

27:16.391 --> 27:17.516
and kind of concentrate on it.

27:17.592 --> 27:21.152
All right. l'm concentrating.

27:21.196 --> 27:23.186
Come on, now. lf you
can't commit to this,

27:23.231 --> 27:24.754
you can't be hypnotized.

27:24.798 --> 27:28.528
lf you've got reservations,
they're gonna get in the way.

27:28.602 --> 27:30.228
Okay.

27:30.271 --> 27:31.760
Al right. l didn't come up here

27:31.805 --> 27:34.238
'cause you make great tea.

27:34.275 --> 27:35.536
Do your worst.

27:35.609 --> 27:36.802
All right,
that's better.

27:36.843 --> 27:39.242
Now...

27:39.279 --> 27:41.769
as l start to hypnotize you,

27:41.814 --> 27:44.247
just let your mind
kind of go blank.

27:44.284 --> 27:46.478
Just let all those
thoughts melt away.

27:46.519 --> 27:47.485
Okay?

27:47.520 --> 27:48.781
Okay.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.787
Concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

27:50.822 --> 27:53.483
Now imagine that
you're in an elevator.

27:53.525 --> 27:55.458
Picture the space. Look up.

27:55.494 --> 27:56.482
See the numbers.

27:56.528 --> 27:59.792
You're on the 32nd floor.

27:59.831 --> 28:02.594
Now watch the numbers
as we count down,

28:02.633 --> 28:07.592
and when we get to one,
you'll be completely relaxed.

28:07.638 --> 28:11.198
Take a deep breath.

28:11.242 --> 28:15.200
32... 31 ...

28:15.245 --> 28:18.873
30... breathe...

28:18.915 --> 28:22.406
29... 28...

28:22.452 --> 28:25.215
Let your eyes close now.

28:25.254 --> 28:28.222
Good. 27...

28:28.257 --> 28:29.518
26...

28:29.591 --> 28:32.423
25...

28:32.461 --> 28:34.894
relax...

28:34.930 --> 28:39.889
24... 23...

28:39.934 --> 28:41.833
22...

28:44.205 --> 28:45.228
Dylan, it's okay.

28:45.273 --> 28:46.330
lt's okay. We've just started.

28:51.945 --> 28:53.002
No, l'm finished.

28:53.046 --> 28:55.240
No, no, wait.
Look, l promise you,

28:55.282 --> 28:57.249
there, there's nothing
that can hurt you here.

28:57.284 --> 28:59.513
l mean, you can come back
to the here and now

28:59.552 --> 29:00.711
any time you want to.

29:03.222 --> 29:07.055
l had a near-death
experience last year,

29:07.093 --> 29:09.185
and l still have...

29:09.228 --> 29:11.320
some dreams l can't shake.

29:11.363 --> 29:12.659
Oh,

29:12.697 --> 29:14.061
you should have told me.

29:14.099 --> 29:16.066
Dreams and imaginings
and regressions--

29:16.101 --> 29:17.067
they're all connected.

29:17.102 --> 29:18.500
Yeah, that's comforting.

29:18.570 --> 29:20.264
But it is.

29:20.305 --> 29:22.204
Can l tell you a secret?

29:22.240 --> 29:24.207
l'm not absolutely sure

29:24.241 --> 29:26.071
that we have lived before.

29:26.110 --> 29:27.872
l mean, there's
the slight possibility

29:27.911 --> 29:29.400
that reincarnation's
just a crock.

29:29.446 --> 29:31.208
Huh, now you tell me.

29:31.248 --> 29:32.509
But what l am

29:32.583 --> 29:34.516
absolutely sure of

29:34.584 --> 29:36.778
is that what we're doing
here-- soul-searching,

29:36.819 --> 29:39.912
self-discovery-- it is a
powerful, powerful tool,

29:39.956 --> 29:43.516
and if you can regress,
you can get that understanding.

29:43.593 --> 29:45.492
You can grow, you can
learn, you can change,

29:45.528 --> 29:48.257
but you've got to relax, okay?

29:48.296 --> 29:50.422
To get the understanding,
you gotta commit.

29:50.465 --> 29:53.228
Or not. Right? l mean,
you said so yourself--

29:53.268 --> 29:54.791
not everybody
can be hypnotized.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.531
You know what? Next time we need
to do this at your house.

29:57.572 --> 29:59.232
You'll be much more comfortable.

29:59.273 --> 30:00.364
Next time?

30:01.475 --> 30:02.441
You really think there's

30:02.476 --> 30:03.464
gonna be a next time?

30:03.511 --> 30:04.977
Mm.

30:12.952 --> 30:15.442
You know, Dad, you really
don't have to stay here.

30:15.488 --> 30:17.921
Yeah, l'm sure we could find
you a nice hotel downtown.

30:17.957 --> 30:20.948
l'll be fine. We're not
exactly on vacation.

30:22.161 --> 30:23.422
Hey, l'm glad you're back.

30:23.462 --> 30:25.725
l just got a call from
someone who saw your flyer,

30:25.764 --> 30:27.196
and they know where your mom is.

30:36.974 --> 30:38.304
Get away.

30:40.845 --> 30:42.243
Get away from me.

30:46.316 --> 30:47.646
Thank you.

30:56.993 --> 30:58.323
Oh, my God.

31:13.675 --> 31:15.107
Sheila?

31:16.778 --> 31:18.768
Sheila... it's me,

31:18.813 --> 31:20.279
Mel.

31:33.493 --> 31:35.483
Mom?

31:39.332 --> 31:41.424
Mom, it's, uh, it's me,

31:41.467 --> 31:43.400
it's David.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.302
Mom, look at me, please.

31:57.681 --> 31:58.806
David?

31:58.849 --> 32:02.909
Yeah. Yeah. Mom, it's me.

32:38.185 --> 32:42.143
Dr. Ashley Devore, please
report to the nurse's station.

32:42.189 --> 32:45.089
Dr. Ashley Devore
to the nurse's station.

32:48.495 --> 32:51.657
Look, Dad... l got to know

32:51.698 --> 32:54.461
this disease that Mom has that
you said runs in the family,

32:54.501 --> 32:56.127
who else has had it?

32:56.168 --> 32:59.159
Your great aunt
was institutionalized

32:59.204 --> 33:02.036
when your mother
was a little girl.

33:02.074 --> 33:04.871
They didn't diagnose it
as manic depression back then,

33:04.910 --> 33:06.501
but from what
your mom has told me,

33:06.612 --> 33:08.010
she had the same highs and lows.

33:08.046 --> 33:10.309
What about me?

33:10.348 --> 33:13.407
Last year, when you were
getting stoned all the time,

33:13.451 --> 33:17.853
there was a part of me that was
actually relieved to find out

33:17.889 --> 33:19.321
that you were high
on crystal meth

33:19.356 --> 33:21.619
and not on your own
body chemistry.

33:21.658 --> 33:25.115
David, it's very important
that you don't fool around

33:25.162 --> 33:26.389
with drugs anymore.

33:26.430 --> 33:29.057
lf you have any propensity
toward this condition,

33:29.099 --> 33:30.429
getting high could trigger it.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.433
Do you understand that?

33:31.467 --> 33:32.455
Yes, l understand!

33:34.103 --> 33:40.371
l'm sorry... it's just a lot
to take in all at once.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.706
l know.

33:42.744 --> 33:45.268
So, what are we gonna do
with her?

33:45.313 --> 33:47.712
l mean, we can't just leave her
up here by herself.

33:47.749 --> 33:50.114
l've thought about that a lot.

33:50.151 --> 33:52.050
And l talked to the doctors.

33:52.087 --> 33:56.352
They feel that we have
to keep her here for now.

33:56.390 --> 33:58.118
A change would be a disaster.

33:58.158 --> 33:59.556
But as soon
as she's strong enough,

33:59.627 --> 34:01.116
we'll bring her
back down to L.A.

34:01.161 --> 34:02.684
Then where's she gonna live?

34:02.730 --> 34:06.392
You can't take care of her,
and l can't take care of her.

34:06.432 --> 34:09.661
They have these places, they're
kind of like halfway houses.

34:09.702 --> 34:13.330
She'll stay in one of those
for a while till she gets a job,

34:13.373 --> 34:15.237
and then we'll find her
an apartment.

34:18.577 --> 34:19.702
Thanks, Dad.

34:19.745 --> 34:21.405
For what, David?
She's your mother.

34:21.446 --> 34:24.744
We brought you into this world
together, and for that,

34:24.783 --> 34:26.511
l will always be grateful
to her.

34:37.661 --> 34:38.719
Mm, l'm starved.

34:38.763 --> 34:40.422
Hey, well, don't fill up
on that garbage.

34:40.464 --> 34:42.761
l'm taking you out
to dinner tonight.

34:42.799 --> 34:44.857
Yeah? Where are we going?

34:44.900 --> 34:46.663
Well, it's a surprise.

34:46.703 --> 34:50.001
But after the show, it's just
you and me on the riverboat.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.973
Mm, l can't wait.

34:52.007 --> 34:55.943
Listen, uh,
about last night...

34:55.978 --> 34:57.501
that's not me.

34:57.546 --> 35:00.537
l know.

35:00.649 --> 35:03.742
Things, um, didn't exactly go
how you planned.

35:03.786 --> 35:05.275
That's for sure.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.049
l mean, it's cool being on the
road with the band and all,

35:08.089 --> 35:10.249
but, uh, there's a lot
of pressure on me

35:10.291 --> 35:11.484
to make something happen,
you know?

35:11.526 --> 35:15.757
And with Silver
showing up like that,

35:15.797 --> 35:19.425
it just reminded me that when
you needed somebody to be there

35:19.466 --> 35:21.956
for you that night
in the apartment...

35:22.002 --> 35:24.299
he was the one that saved you
from that lunatic,

35:24.337 --> 35:26.497
not me, you know?

35:26.573 --> 35:30.702
What l know is that you love me.

35:30.743 --> 35:32.039
That's all that really matters.

35:32.078 --> 35:35.513
And since we have a few
more days left together,

35:35.548 --> 35:38.015
l think we should
make them perfect.

35:38.050 --> 35:39.482
You got it.

35:55.699 --> 35:56.926
What are you smiling about?

35:56.967 --> 35:58.900
Nothing.

35:58.936 --> 35:59.833
Nothing?

36:04.707 --> 36:05.695
Unbutton it.

36:08.077 --> 36:10.067

36:11.781 --> 36:13.407

36:17.119 --> 36:18.710
Oh, you kidding?

36:18.754 --> 36:19.720

36:21.957 --> 36:22.945

36:22.991 --> 36:24.617

36:24.659 --> 36:26.990
Love? No, l don't... You know
what? We can get you to a doctor

36:27.028 --> 36:28.426
'cause they got a laser,
and they'll just...

36:28.462 --> 36:30.952
Dylan, listen,

36:30.998 --> 36:32.555
lt'll come off, like,
in a couple days.

36:33.601 --> 36:34.726
l really had you going.

36:34.769 --> 36:35.860
Yeah, you really got me.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.130
You happy?

36:41.775 --> 36:43.435
But this doesn't come off.

36:43.476 --> 36:46.672
So you really did it, huh?

36:46.713 --> 36:48.703
Yeah. You don't like it?

36:48.748 --> 36:50.612
A daisy?

36:50.650 --> 36:54.141
Yeah, kind of like, uh, he
loves me, he loves me not.

36:54.186 --> 36:56.119
He loves you not.

36:57.356 --> 36:59.949
But... since you're here...

37:07.064 --> 37:08.030
David?

37:08.065 --> 37:09.725
Mom.

37:13.104 --> 37:17.369
l feel like l've been...
oh, sleeping for weeks.

37:17.407 --> 37:19.465
You probably were.

37:21.178 --> 37:23.077
l was so ashamed.

37:23.113 --> 37:25.706
Mom, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

37:27.349 --> 37:29.942
Why don't you show
your mother what you found?

37:29.985 --> 37:31.918
Yeah.

37:31.954 --> 37:33.477
What is it?

37:33.589 --> 37:38.890
lt's a, it's a tape that you
and l made a long time ago.

37:40.261 --> 37:42.854
Okay, one, two...

37:42.897 --> 37:45.694
Remember when you were teaching
David how to play the piano?

37:45.733 --> 37:49.862
Are you sleeping?

37:49.904 --> 37:51.029
Again.

37:51.071 --> 37:54.528
Are you sleeping?

37:56.610 --> 37:59.077
That's fine.
Come on. Keep going.

37:59.112 --> 38:05.346
Brother John,
Brother John...

38:05.384 --> 38:11.253
l, uh... never wanted
to be a burden to anybody.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.327
l always thought l could
take care of myself.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.456
Okay, big finish!

38:21.499 --> 38:27.733
Yeah, well, uh, you don't
have to do that anymore.

38:27.771 --> 38:29.931
Keep going doing it. Go on.
Da...

38:29.974 --> 38:31.099
One more time perfectly.

38:49.025 --> 38:50.855
Dylan?

38:52.361 --> 38:54.225
Hello?

38:54.263 --> 38:57.459
Hi. There you are.

39:00.335 --> 39:04.202
l was just looking up
at the moon.

39:04.238 --> 39:05.431
Well, can two play?

39:05.539 --> 39:07.062
No.

39:09.911 --> 39:11.605
So what's the matter
with you?

39:11.646 --> 39:15.206
ls it something l did?

39:15.248 --> 39:16.646
No.

39:18.919 --> 39:20.886
Did you get spooked up
at Molly's?

39:25.292 --> 39:28.260
l don't like the idea
of being hypnotized.

39:28.294 --> 39:31.126
Listen, do you really
trust this Molly?

39:31.163 --> 39:33.687
l don't trust anybody.

39:33.732 --> 39:35.323
Then blow her off.

39:35.367 --> 39:38.301
Listen, like my father
used to say,

39:38.336 --> 39:41.031
''We're only here
for a short time,

39:41.072 --> 39:43.972
so you gotta make it
a good time.''

39:45.610 --> 39:47.008
Yeah, that's the problem.

39:51.715 --> 39:54.683
See, l'm, l'm thinking
maybe we're not just here

39:54.718 --> 39:56.446
for a short time.
