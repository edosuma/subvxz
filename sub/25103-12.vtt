[narrator]
Previously, on Queen Sugar.

00:02.290 --> 00:05.373
I need you to make him see that
some decisions,

00:05.420 --> 00:06.660
they cant be undone.

00:06.710 --> 00:08.450
Take a paternity test.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.469
I took it. He aint mine.
ButI raised him.

00:11.510 --> 00:14.468
That dont mean you can just
take him away from me.

00:14.510 --> 00:17.673
If you and your friends
want to grow your activism,

00:17.720 --> 00:20.462
you need to learn
to organize.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.885
Were going to take
my brother down,

00:21.930 --> 00:23.591
side by side.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.017
Didnt you get the memo?
We voted three days ago.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.358
-You cant do this.
-You dont show up,

00:28.400 --> 00:29.856
you dont vote.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.776
What gets me up
in the morning

00:33.820 --> 00:36.732
besides my family
and my Hollywood:

00:36.780 --> 00:38.361
the work.

00:38.410 --> 00:39.695
The work is everything.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.322
Its what gives me life,

00:42.370 --> 00:46.204
what gives me purpose,
what gives me joy.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.491
And I am filled
with gratitude

00:48.540 --> 00:50.917
-to all of you out there...
-Hey, how are you doing?

00:50.960 --> 00:54.509
...who are enjoying a taste
of what I love to do.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.506
[female host] We thank you
for coming on our show.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.381
[turns TV off]

00:58.430 --> 01:01.593
Aunt Vi said the orders
are coming in like wildfire.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.221
Got to_run over there
In a few.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.511
[Prosper]
No, Im fine, yeah.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.346
Yeah, I appreciate
the offer,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.015
but were going to be
getting my house back soon,

01:09.060 --> 01:11.472
so-- yeah, I promise.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.600
Just tell the kids they better
come visit me this summer.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.140
[Prosper laughs]

01:15.200 --> 01:16.519
Yeah, kiss Lila
and Joseph for me.

01:16.570 --> 01:17.901
Bye.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.900
-Hows she doing?
-Oh, shes good.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.999
Shes got a big project
at work keeping her busy.

01:26.710 --> 01:28.780
Can I get you some breakfast
before I go?

01:28.830 --> 01:30.627
Oh, Im okay.

01:30.670 --> 01:33.412
Im meeting some folks
at the High Yellow in a bit.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.463
_C_ounci| vote
IS In two days,

01:36.510 --> 01:39.138
and we got to talk about
our next steps.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.545
Mm-hmm.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.965
Speaking of which,

01:43.020 --> 01:45.762
the parish meetings tonight,

01:45.810 --> 01:47.846
and me and the farmers,

01:47.900 --> 01:49.765
weve been talking.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.222
And we think you should speak
in front of the council

01:52.270 --> 01:53.771
on our behalf.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.026
Oh, wow.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.560
Wow, thats, uh...

01:56.610 --> 01:58.908
thats very kind, but...

02:00.570 --> 02:01.571
I dont know.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.656
Uh...

02:03.700 --> 02:06.328
I mean, youre already working
on the talking points.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.247
And I know youve done
the research.

02:08.290 --> 02:10.838
I mean, you could really talk
some sense into these folks.

02:12.670 --> 02:15.798
I would love to represent
the farmers, I would.

02:18.510 --> 02:19.750
Just...

02:21.470 --> 02:23.677
I dont know if thats
the best idea.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.971
Why not?

02:27.890 --> 02:29.892
Because...

02:33.520 --> 02:34.896
I sold the mill.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.817
I sold Queen Sugar
to the Landrys.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.363
Theyre letting me
continue to run it, but--

02:42.410 --> 02:44.116
[stammers]
I dont get what youre saying.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.696
You and I both know,
Sams not going to stop

02:45.740 --> 02:47.446
taking everybodys land.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.254
I sold the mill
as leverage

02:56.300 --> 02:58.757
for the farmers security,

02:58.800 --> 03:00.620
their stability,

03:00.680 --> 03:03.922
their livelihood,

03:03.970 --> 03:05.506
their freedom.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.050
From Sam.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.801
But youre in business
with the devil, Charley.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.487
Thats only way
theyre going to see it.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.291
Dreams never die

03:36.340 --> 03:38.501
Take flight
As the world turns

03:38.550 --> 03:40.415
Dreams never die

03:40.470 --> 03:42.210
Take flight
As the world turns

03:42.260 --> 03:44.046
Keep the colors
In the lines

03:44.090 --> 03:45.500
Take flight

03:46.810 --> 03:47.959
Dreams never die

03:53.940 --> 03:57.012
Keep the colors
In the lines

03:59.070 --> 04:01.106
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

04:03.410 --> 04:04.729
Mom!

04:04.780 --> 04:06.611

04:15.750 --> 04:17.206

04:17.250 --> 04:19.548

Uncle Wood and Aunt Vi.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.006
[clears throat]

04:23.050 --> 04:25.177

Be good.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.785
Your mom still

04:57.840 --> 05:00.411
She went back to DC.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.885
I told her that Id be
handling things from now on.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.465
[clears throat]

05:10.430 --> 05:12.466
All right.

05:14.390 --> 05:15.766

05:15.810 --> 05:18.222
Yall be safe.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.761

05:20.820 --> 05:22.435
[Darla]

-[B|ue] You ready?
-[Darla] Im ready.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.987
I wasnt sure
if these were the ones

05:27.030 --> 05:28.770
you were asking me for,

05:28.820 --> 05:31.573
but I printed them up.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.570
Where is everybody?

05:38.630 --> 05:40.245
We went radio silent.

05:41.590 --> 05:44.161
Nobodys talking
or texting.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.178
Dont want it used
against us.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.176
But we were cleared.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.756
Till they find
something else.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.420
Look, man...

05:55.180 --> 05:57.307
everybodys scared.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.055
I am too.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.810
But were going
to get through this.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.350
All of us.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.607
Were all going
to get through this?

06:06.650 --> 06:07.947
Yes.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.309
Micah, Ants on house arrest.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.408
Yes. I know that.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.486
Hes already caught up
in the system.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.996
We cant just say,
"Im sorry"

06:15.040 --> 06:16.359
and walk away from that.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.911
You dont think
I know that?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.417
Ive been working
on this track scholarship too.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.881
And with all this...

06:32.640 --> 06:34.801
Okay, so...

06:34.850 --> 06:36.806
we got to do something.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.846
We got to say something.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.844
We?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.606
What?

06:42.650 --> 06:44.857
No offense, Micah,
but you know damn well

06:44.900 --> 06:46.856
you aint never going
to be in Ants situation.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.198
And even if you are,

06:49.240 --> 06:51.276
house arrest at that big house
of yours?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.736
Aint that bad.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.241
Thats not fair.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.030
Neither is what happened
to Ant.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.128
This...

07:01.170 --> 07:03.286
this isnt about fair.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.832
This is about surviving.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.507
And for you...

07:12.720 --> 07:16.269
for you, surviving
is taking this picture

07:16.310 --> 07:18.471
instead of being in it.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.892
Really, KJ?

07:23.940 --> 07:25.817
Im in this with you.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.407
We got to keep
our heads low...

07:33.410 --> 07:35.731
till we can get out,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.736
escape to college.

07:40.370 --> 07:42.418
[school bell rings]

07:52.130 --> 07:56.169
[Charley] And all your help at
the hospital, thank you, really.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.097
Charley, get off
that phone.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.676
[sighs]

07:59.730 --> 08:01.345
Sorry, I have to go.

08:01.390 --> 08:04.052
No, my aunts swamped
with pie orders,

08:04.100 --> 08:06.148
so, duty calls.

08:06.190 --> 08:08.522
Can I give you a call
a little later?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.276
Okay.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.231
Yeah, bye.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.316
[phone beeps off]

08:18.040 --> 08:20.406
I thought you had a whole host
of pies to get out the door.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.031
I do.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.957
But I need to finish
this seating chart

08:24.000 --> 08:26.377
so Hollywood can order

08:26.420 --> 08:28.991
some special invitations
from Morocco.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.870
I tell you, that man.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.581
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:32.630 --> 08:36.134
We got to keep those two
far apart.

08:36.180 --> 08:39.502
Uh, Charley,
you and Micah,

08:39.560 --> 08:42.802
if you sit
with Rah and Blue...

08:42.850 --> 08:46.854
Well, actually,
I could use an extra seat

08:46.900 --> 08:48.185
for a plus-one.

08:48.230 --> 08:50.607
I might bring someone.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.107
Im just saying,
Id like the option.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.903
Thats great, Charley.
Really.

08:55.950 --> 08:57.770
What about you, Nova?

08:57.820 --> 08:59.981
You bringing that mystery
man or woman of yours?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.747
[Nova]
Ill be coming alone, Aunt Vi.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.246
I dont have nobody
to bring?

09:04.290 --> 09:06.281
I dont need anyone
to prop me up.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.457
What?

09:12.510 --> 09:14.046
Nothing. Nothing.

09:14.090 --> 09:15.330
You lock in a caterer yet?

09:15.380 --> 09:16.790
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.966
Whats going on
with you two?

09:20.010 --> 09:22.092
Ive seen how you
been all formal

09:22.140 --> 09:23.630
and delicate
with each other lately.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.056
You have a tiff
or something?

09:25.100 --> 09:27.648
No. Not exactly.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.760
Well, what, exactly?
Speak.

09:32.570 --> 09:33.810
Nova?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.026
It was something.
Now its nothing.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.230
Its over.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.657
I was seeing Remy.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.190
Its over.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.366
It wasnt right,
so I ended it.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.502
You ended it?

09:53.550 --> 09:55.586
When did that ever start?

09:55.630 --> 09:57.086
While yall were together?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.927
No! You know me
better than that.

09:58.970 --> 10:01.097
Now, Im not sure I know you
at all right now.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.727
Aunt Vi...

10:04.770 --> 10:07.432
You okay with Nova
being with the same man

10:07.480 --> 10:09.596
after hes done with you?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.049
And you,

10:11.110 --> 10:13.021
I never took you
to be one

10:13.070 --> 10:15.186
_ who would be interested
In your SIsters sloppy seconds.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.105
[Nova]
Dont make it sound cheap.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.028
Oh, so now you concerned
about how it looks and sounds?

10:20.070 --> 10:22.277
[Nova] It wasnt like that.
I thought it was something real.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.480
Otherwise I never
would have done it.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.280
Aunt Vi, have you never
done anything in your life

10:26.330 --> 10:28.571
that youve regretted and then
tried to take it back?

10:32.130 --> 10:35.668
First its the story
about your daddy, now its this.

10:35.710 --> 10:38.463
You doing a lot
of extra things, Nova.

10:38.510 --> 10:41.547
But thats all right.
You can, cause you grown.

10:43.890 --> 10:46.927
Im just disappointed,
thats all.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.596
Got to go to my kitchen.

10:55.980 --> 10:59.279
[door opens and closes]

11:02.490 --> 11:04.230
Its not important.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.287
[Charley]
You can tell me.

11:10.620 --> 11:14.124
They felt you were serving your
own interest instead of theirs.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.877
Cardale even
called you a...

11:19.220 --> 11:20.926
damn hypocrite.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.335
Theyre the ones
who bailed on me last year.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.346
So in return
you lied to them?

11:32.850 --> 11:34.681
I appreciate you telling me.

11:38.820 --> 11:40.640
It doesnt mean
we stop fighting.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.610
Im _still here
WIth you.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.916
-Hey, Mom?
-Yeah.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.791
Sorry to interrupt.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.673
Uh, I just wanted
to tell you Im heading out.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.256
Ill be back later.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.516
Wait.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.515
Where are you going?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.552
To see Ant.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.512
Micah, weve discussed this.
I dont want you going there.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.516
-He could go to juvie.
-Micah!

12:17.570 --> 12:19.640
I said no.

12:19.690 --> 12:23.274
He could be going to juvie
because of all of us.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.981
And for an accident?
Come on.

12:25.030 --> 12:27.191
Trespassing, vandalism.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.787
Those werent
aCCIdents.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.445
You know, if it was me
that got caught,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.956
youd be outing
every kid that was there.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.410
-That is not true.
-Yes, It Is.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.030
He shouldnt be
going through this alone.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.796
[sighs]

12:48.600 --> 12:50.921
[indistinct chatter]

13:21.510 --> 13:24.582
The turnouts bigger
than I thought.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.586
Yeah.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.380
A lot of people showed up.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.841
Miss Bordelon,
I just wanted to say hello.

13:31.890 --> 13:34.347
Its always good
to see you.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.021
[indistinct chatter]

13:58.330 --> 14:00.662
Why Nova sitting
way over there for?

14:00.710 --> 14:02.120
[Charley]
Just leave her be.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.661
What happened with yall?

14:04.710 --> 14:06.758
Yall messy.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.136
Im Isabel Barrera,

14:14.180 --> 14:16.011
from the St. Josephine
Parish Council.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.096
If you can all get settled,
well get started

14:18.140 --> 14:21.359
to discuss the upcoming vote
on the new correctional facility

14:21.400 --> 14:23.061
proposed to be built
in St. Jo.

14:23.110 --> 14:25.101
Lets get in and out of here
on time, folks.

14:25.150 --> 14:27.527
[Isabel]
All right, then. Lets begin.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.151
I lost my job when
the Watkins Mill shut down.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.997
Been out _of work
ever SInce.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.702
This jail could be the change
folks like me

14:38.750 --> 14:40.741
need to turn it back around.

14:40.790 --> 14:43.202
Yall have my full support
bringing it here. Thank you.

14:44.630 --> 14:46.666
Thank you
for sharing that.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.676
And not only that,

14:48.720 --> 14:51.678
but the MPTE Group
has a five-step plan

14:51.720 --> 14:54.257
thatll unfold over the next
several years.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.302
We plan to clean up
the contaminated land.

14:57.350 --> 14:58.840
We plan to build schools

14:58.890 --> 15:00.471
thatl|_service_ _
the growmg famIIIes

15:00.520 --> 15:02.476
thatll move here to work.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.476
Your school aint nothing
but a Band-Aid for a broken arm.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.726
-[man] Yes!
-[woman] You said it.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.395
[applause]

15:07.440 --> 15:09.692
-[man] Thats all it is.
-[Lawrence] Okay.

15:09.740 --> 15:10.900
Well, not just a school.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.362
Were also in talks

15:13.410 --> 15:15.196
to build
shopping centers

15:15.240 --> 15:18.118
and more housing
to bring even more life

15:18.160 --> 15:19.286
to St. Josephine.

15:19.330 --> 15:20.820
We already have lives!

15:20.870 --> 15:22.701
Yall trying
to take them away.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.627
-[man] Thats right.
-[woman] We dont need that!

15:24.670 --> 15:26.080
[applause]

15:27.760 --> 15:29.796
With all due respect, sir,

15:29.840 --> 15:33.139
we dont need anyone to come
here and build our community.

15:33.180 --> 15:35.307
No, sir, youre deliberately
trying to break something

15:35.350 --> 15:37.716
so that later you can say
you fixed it.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.842
-[woman] Thats right.
-[applause]

15:40.890 --> 15:42.801
You aint going
to say nothing?

15:42.850 --> 15:44.056
[Lawrence]
No, I hear you.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.396
-I do.
-Say something.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.931
[Lawrence] But, you know,
its not what I have to say.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.140
Its what your friends,
and your neighbors,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.987
and your fellow citizens have
to say about it that matters.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.366
"My boys have jobs

15:58.410 --> 16:01.322
"and are building
towards their retirement.

16:01.370 --> 16:03.747
Dont know what theyd do
without it."

16:03.790 --> 16:05.337
Now, this is from Lauren.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.416
Shes a mother from Mobile,

16:07.460 --> 16:10.122
and all of her sons work at
the new correctIonal faCIIIty

16:10.170 --> 16:12.001
we built just a few years ago.

16:12.050 --> 16:15.133
What about the mothers
of the sons you locked up

16:15.180 --> 16:16.886
so Laurens sons
could have a job?

16:16.930 --> 16:18.636
You got any letters
from them?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.557
Or do you just go
from town to town,

16:20.600 --> 16:22.340
reading these same
generic quotes

16:22.390 --> 16:25.302
over and over and over again?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.760
-She got some nerve.
-[woman 1] I know, right?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.027
[indistinct murmurs]

16:30.070 --> 16:32.732
-[woman 2] Thats right.
-[man 1] Sit down.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.237
[man 2]
You a damn liar.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.191
[scoffs]

16:40.250 --> 16:42.491
I have seen
so many famIIIes

16:42.540 --> 16:47.034
kicked off of their land
under false pretenses.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.456
Forced to take their kids
out of school.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.502
Is building your jail
really worth

16:51.550 --> 16:53.541
more farmers giving up
their livelihoods?

16:53.590 --> 16:55.000
Their dignity?

16:55.050 --> 16:56.426
[Cardale]
Oh, big talk now.

16:56.470 --> 16:58.097
Whatd you think
would happen

16:58.140 --> 17:01.018
when you sold your mill
to the same family

17:01.060 --> 17:02.971
thats trying to kick us
off the land?

17:03.020 --> 17:05.477
-[man] Tell it, Cardale.
-You one of them, Miss Charley.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.431
-I made a deal.
-[Cardale] For you.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.392
No. For you.
For you.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.396
[woman]
Yeah, right!

17:14.150 --> 17:17.654
I tried to keep
farmers working.

17:17.700 --> 17:22.820
I gave up my mill
to leverage fair rates for you,

17:22.870 --> 17:25.327
to keep you in business.

17:25.370 --> 17:28.589
They were going to keep
coming at us.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.838
I did it so we could all live
to fight another day.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.461
But this prison...

17:33.510 --> 17:35.796
this prison,
if they build it,

17:35.840 --> 17:37.671
that day will never come.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.540
Theyll make sure of it.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.422
What kind of wages
are you paying, Mr. Callahan?

17:43.480 --> 17:44.970
Most of your facilities,

17:45.020 --> 17:46.476
they pay just above
the minimum?

17:46.520 --> 17:49.057
Isnt that right?
The minimum.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.510
Not to mention
the free labor

17:51.570 --> 17:54.277
youll get from
the prison inmates.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.947
-[indistinct murmurs]
-Yeah.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.901
[applause]

17:59.870 --> 18:01.656
[Lawrence]
All right, all right.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.498
Were more than prepared
to offer competitive wages

18:04.540 --> 18:06.531
to all the staff,
Miss Bordelon.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.457
Oh, really? I guess theres
a first time for everything.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.377
Your companys history
doesnt suggest that.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.503
-Am I right, Mr. Callahan?
-[applause]

18:13.550 --> 18:15.711
And lets not forget,

18:15.760 --> 18:18.968
when legislative boundaries
are redrawn,

18:19.010 --> 18:21.296
prisoners are counted
as residents,

18:21.350 --> 18:22.965
but they cant vote.

18:23.010 --> 18:25.228
So who does that benefit?
Is it us?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.886
Is that the town winning?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.352
Or is it politicians
who gain

18:30.400 --> 18:33.858
off population growth
during re-elections?

18:33.900 --> 18:35.811
[applause]

18:39.740 --> 18:44.530
Mr. Callahan, the soul
of St. Jo isnt for sale.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.070
I dont know
what you mean by that.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.076
[Charley]
Yeah, I think you do.

18:48.120 --> 18:53.660
All you want is to put
more bodies in more prisons...

18:55.590 --> 18:59.924
to make a profit
off your backs.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.712
Our family, our friends,

19:02.760 --> 19:04.250
the people we love.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.427
Thats who they want
to lock up.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.937
Then they want you to work to
get a dime out of every dollar

19:09.980 --> 19:11.686
theyre gonna squeeze
out of this community.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.937
[woman 1]
Thats right.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.312
[woman 2]
You tell them.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.770
[man]
Tell them, Charley.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.271
So why dont you
just take your bags

19:21.320 --> 19:24.118
and take your snake oil
and go someplace else,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.617
because we are not
buyIng It.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.992
[applause]

19:53.020 --> 19:57.605
Yes, were twisting
And were fighting

19:57.650 --> 20:00.187
But we wont let it go

20:02.030 --> 20:04.612
[phone rings]

20:04.660 --> 20:07.538
-[Rhonda] Hey, Miss Violet.
-Oh, good.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.788
_ Jarrett called

20:10.830 --> 20:13.071
Says the phone is ringing
off the hook.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.747
Extra business is good
for everybody, right?

20:22.220 --> 20:26.008
Yes, maam. Last thing we need
around here is more jail cells.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.677
For sure.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.096
[Rhonda]
You okay, Miss Violet?

20:33.140 --> 20:35.608

of my lung tIssue.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.386
Well, that sounds serious.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.055
What does that mean?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.680
I mean, did they run tests
and everything?

21:18.730 --> 21:20.311
Did they say

24:42.190 --> 24:43.680
Let me look
at your hands.

24:43.730 --> 24:46.608
Let me see, baby.
Let me see.

24:46.650 --> 24:48.686
Did you hurt yourself?

24:48.730 --> 24:51.278
Youre not
doing it right.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.276
Youre okay.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.526
Lets try one more time.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.231
Dont quit.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.771
-Just put it back on.
-I dont want to.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.287
Come on, just give it
one more try.

25:06.290 --> 25:08.281
Where are you going?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.659
Blue, come on.

25:09.710 --> 25:12.508
Me and you,
we got this.

25:15.510 --> 25:17.137
[sighs]

25:23.850 --> 25:25.898
This feels a little
like Pops, dont it?

25:27.190 --> 25:29.351
Overworked.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.392
Keeping it all to himself
till its too late.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.022
I aint trying
to go through that again.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.110
Shes just as prideful
as Daddy was.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.536
So, what does lupus do,
anyway?

25:47.580 --> 25:51.164
Basically, your immune system
starts attacking healthy tissue.

25:51.210 --> 25:54.338
She says its like running a
marathon while battling the flu.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.792
Glad you and Hollywood
were there for her.

26:01.390 --> 26:02.880
[knock on door]

26:02.930 --> 26:04.727
-[Charley] Hey! you came.
-Hey.

26:04.770 --> 26:06.431
Raced right over.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.720
What can I do?

26:07.770 --> 26:10.352
This is Romero, my friend.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.277
-How you doing?
-Romero.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.811
I thought we could use
some more help.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.487
This is my sister, Nova.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.521
-Good to meet you.
-Romero. Pleasure.

26:18.570 --> 26:21.368
Why dont you just help me take
these pies out to the truck.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.946
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.530
-You got it on your side?
-Yeah.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.116
-Okay.
-All right. Is this good?

26:28.170 --> 26:30.286
Yeah. Um...

26:30.330 --> 26:32.127
thank you.

26:32.170 --> 26:35.082
But you didnt need to rush
all the way down here.

26:35.130 --> 26:38.372
We still get pie
at the end though, right?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.170
I just assumed that,

26:40.220 --> 26:42.927
you know, we would get
a pie or something...

26:42.970 --> 26:45.177
-Yeah, yeah. We can...
-...out of this.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.721
we can probably
make that happen.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.840
I like the lemon.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.436
Okay, yes.
One lemon pie.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.357
[laughs]
Sure.

26:56.070 --> 26:57.776
Why dont just read
off the ones on your side

26:57.820 --> 26:59.276
and Ill check them off.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.400
-Yeah.
-Okay.

27:00.450 --> 27:01.690
So, two...

27:01.740 --> 27:03.150
two cherry tortes.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.781
Three pecan pies.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.378
Why dont you come over.

27:13.420 --> 27:17.413
And Ill cook for you,
one of my famous recipes.

27:17.470 --> 27:21.213
My chicken mole
is exquisite.

27:22.890 --> 27:24.346
You dont have to worry
about anything.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.881
All you have to do
is show up.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.430
I think Id like that.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.629
Yeah?

27:30.690 --> 27:33.227
-Yeah.
-Good.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.726
That works.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.771
-I see lime.
-[laughs]

27:38.820 --> 27:41.232
-No lemon.
-I dont see lemon on this side.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.020
I hope you have a lemon
on that side.

27:43.070 --> 27:44.446
-Is that a dealbreaker?

27:44.490 --> 27:46.071
Can I still get
that mole

27:46.120 --> 27:47.747
-if theres no lemon pie?
-Oh, yes.

27:47.790 --> 27:49.576
-Yes, you will get the mole.
-[laughs]

27:52.500 --> 27:54.536
[gunfire on video game]

27:54.590 --> 27:56.581
[knock on door]

28:06.260 --> 28:08.467
Ive been calling you, dude,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.090
to see if you was all right.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.020
Whens the court date?

28:19.070 --> 28:20.480
Sometime this month.

28:20.530 --> 28:21.770
My mom knows.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.361
Whatd the lawyer say?

28:27.870 --> 28:29.440
Says I can get
about six months.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.070
Six months?

28:32.250 --> 28:33.456
Whoa.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.418
Going to miss junior prom.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.509
I was supposed to go
to this LSU summer program

28:42.550 --> 28:44.757
for college aid,

28:44.800 --> 28:48.179
but I guess Im not
doing that now.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.226
You know, this is
all our fault.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.528
No, they found my lighter.

29:02.570 --> 29:03.889
So...

29:05.240 --> 29:06.867
The whole thing
is just stupid.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.525
No, it wasnt stupid.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.899
We made a mistake, yeah,

29:09.950 --> 29:13.158
but what we were
tryIng to say...

29:15.120 --> 29:17.122
it wasnt stupid.

29:17.170 --> 29:20.128
Look, its better that they only
found one of us, all right?

29:20.170 --> 29:22.661
No, its not fair that youre
taking the fall for all of us.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.006
I know. I know.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.631
Thats just how it goes.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.250
I remember you said,

29:30.310 --> 29:32.210
"always fight
for what you believe,

29:32.270 --> 29:36.149
no matter who it makes
uncomfortable or who It scares."

29:37.270 --> 29:38.806
I remember that.

29:44.030 --> 29:47.614
Hey, and plus, you know,
when I get out...

29:47.660 --> 29:49.571
the girls, theyre going to be
all over me.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.110
[laughs]

29:51.160 --> 29:52.696
You know,
they love a bad boy.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.036
Like Killmonger
or some shit.

30:03.210 --> 30:05.542
Yo, Im going to be there.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.506
No matter what.

30:08.550 --> 30:10.632
Im going to be there
for you.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.116
Thank you.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.466
How are you
holding up?

30:50.510 --> 30:54.628
_ Seems like this decision
Is takIng longer than normal.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.511
And I just...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.555
I dont know
what to think.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.647
If those council members
have any sense at all,

31:05.690 --> 31:10.525
theyve been considering
every word you said.

31:10.570 --> 31:13.653
But then again, Sam has half
the council in his pocket, 50--

31:13.700 --> 31:15.281
Of course he does.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.741
How do we find
justice these days

31:18.790 --> 31:22.578
when it seems_ like
It no longer eXIsts?

31:25.250 --> 31:28.959
The hope now lies
in the other council members.

31:30.470 --> 31:32.540
Theres one,
Council Member Ward,

31:32.600 --> 31:36.092
who may be the deciding vote
in our favor.

31:37.470 --> 31:38.926
You seem sure.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.766
Ward usually
plays it straight.

31:40.810 --> 31:43.722
We can only hope.

31:46.690 --> 31:50.023
My father always led us
armored with hope.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.481
Even in his darkest days.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.329
But now Im starting to think
it was all just fairy tales...

32:02.750 --> 32:04.706
made up to protect us

32:04.750 --> 32:07.378
from the evils
just outside our door.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.682
[door opens]

32:28.940 --> 32:30.931
[indistinct chatter]

32:56.550 --> 32:59.599
Thank you. Thanks.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.880
Thank you.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.564
Always walking
A vicious circle

33:13.610 --> 33:15.601
The Council has voted
on the construction

33:15.660 --> 33:18.151
of a correctional facility
in the St. Josephine Parish.

33:20.870 --> 33:22.531
Ive been given the ballots,

33:22.580 --> 33:24.662

votes out loud.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.492
Council Member Ward...

34:16.880 --> 34:17.960
for.

34:18.010 --> 34:19.671
[all gasp and shout]

34:22.350 --> 34:24.841
The result of the votes
is as follows.

34:24.890 --> 34:28.144
Four votes in favor,
three votes against.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.227
This gives approval
to the MPTE Group,

34:31.270 --> 34:33.067
from the Parish Council,

34:33.110 --> 34:35.146
for the construction
of a correctIonal faCIIIty

34:35.190 --> 34:36.566
in the St. Josephine Parish,

34:36.610 --> 34:39.693

our meetIng.

Thank you all.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.650

34:52.210 --> 34:54.166
[Ralph Angel]
This aint the end to all this.

35:13.820 --> 35:19.770
Always walking
A vicious circle

[inaudible]

35:55.480 --> 35:57.528
[indistinct chatter on TV]

36:30.430 --> 36:33.809
We all get
Our feelings hurt

36:33.850 --> 36:35.351
[phone line rings]

36:35.400 --> 36:38.358
Talking to each other

36:40.070 --> 36:41.606
-[woman on phone] Hey, Dad.
-Yeah, hi.

36:41.650 --> 36:43.311
Whats going on?
You okay?

36:43.360 --> 36:45.772
Im_fine.
Its just...

36:47.530 --> 36:49.748
things getting a little shaky
for your dad.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.821
Yeah, yeah.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.741
Probably time you come down.

36:59.130 --> 37:01.416
Time to come get me.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.962
I saw a woman playing drums

37:05.010 --> 37:09.800
And I thought she might
Be our savior

37:11.930 --> 37:15.889
She smiled so big
It made me think

37:15.940 --> 37:20.525
Im going to change
My behavior

37:21.780 --> 37:25.193
Oh

37:25.240 --> 37:29.449
Theres no end
To being scared

Makes me a mark

Oh

38:08.450 --> 38:11.408
Theres no end

38:11.450 --> 38:12.735
To being scared

38:18.210 --> 38:19.871
[car door closes]

38:21.920 --> 38:23.080
It was awful.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.256
Couldnt be that bad.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.870
Blue!

38:27.010 --> 38:28.250
Come on out here.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.216
-Come on, come down here.
-What?

38:31.260 --> 38:33.467
Were going
to try this again.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.977
You know what
we dont do?

38:39.020 --> 38:40.100
What?

38:40.150 --> 38:41.970
Quit.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.476
Put your helmet on.

38:46.150 --> 38:48.277
Let me set this
for you.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.323
Everything working fine.
You ready?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.070
All right.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.995
You got it? You ready?

39:03.050 --> 39:04.790
Dont let go
until I say so.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.876
All right.
Get on the bike.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.923
-Seriously.
-Seriously, get on the bike.

39:09.970 --> 39:12.040
-Ready?
-Can both of you hold on?

39:15.470 --> 39:16.926
[clears throat]

39:20.310 --> 39:22.141
Focus. Now you got
to focus.

39:22.190 --> 39:24.146
Keep your eyes
straight ahead.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.896
Dont let go.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.350
Dont let go yet.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.446
Were going
to let you fly.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.060
You got it.

39:30.110 --> 39:31.566
You all right?

39:31.620 --> 39:33.656
Dont let go.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.861
Well, you got to trust us.

39:35.910 --> 39:38.037
You got to trust yourself,
all right?

39:39.460 --> 39:40.529
Come on,
lets try it again.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.161
Just keep pedaling.

39:42.210 --> 39:43.996
Just keep moving.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.871
Come on, focus.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.161
Just keep on pedaling.
Keep moving, keep moving.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.120
Keep moving.
There it is.

39:52.510 --> 39:54.137

Look at me, Pop.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.037
-Look.
-I see you.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.991
[both laugh]

40:23.710 --> 40:26.281
I cried on you

40:29.090 --> 40:32.548
Maybe we should just
split the time.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.466
50/50?

40:43.190 --> 40:44.475
All right.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.645
[clears throat]

40:54.570 --> 40:56.060
Thank you.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.242
Couple months,
when Im off parole,

41:00.290 --> 41:01.826

41:04.960 --> 41:06.871
Going to take Blue

different.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.870
Hell love that.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.596

to show him places.

or Disney World?

41:30.610 --> 41:33.238

Shit, all of them.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.352
I just want to show him
everything.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.192
Be a free man.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.571
For real.

41:43.660 --> 41:45.787
Thatll be the day.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.207
Itll be a beautiful day.

41:55.050 --> 41:56.881
