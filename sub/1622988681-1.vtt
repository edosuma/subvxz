I'm leaving. Hmm?

42:44.667 --> 42:46.500
DOMINIC: You're leaving where?

42:46.500 --> 42:49.200
Leaving here. I'm heading east,
to the city.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.967
The...the cities are
swarming with infected.

42:52.967 --> 42:54.567

livable again.

since we've been there.

42:56.300 --> 42:57.633
Sure, Alex. Yeah, sure.

42:57.633 --> 42:58.933
I'm sure we could
just go to a cafe

42:58.933 --> 43:00.367
and grab a coffee
and a paper and...

43:00.367 --> 43:02.900
Dominic, it's time
for you to grow up.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.200
- "Grow up"?
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

43:05.300 --> 43:07.867
Grow up. Now.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.967
I travelled across the world
to find you.

43:23.967 --> 43:26.667

43:26.667 --> 43:31.133

43:31.133 --> 43:35.633
to get home...to you.

and you talk about infected.

compared to

43:40.267 --> 43:41.633

to each other.

to come home to me.

43:45.633 --> 43:47.967
But you have to remember,

43:47.967 --> 43:50.133
I promised your mother,
I promised Maggie,

43:50.133 --> 43:51.700
that I'd protect you.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.567
You're the last of my family.

Did he?

44:00.333 --> 44:02.600
No.

No, he's been quiet
for quite some time now.

44:08.633 --> 44:09.900
What?

44:11.367 --> 44:12.667
You don't.

44:12.667 --> 44:15.267
No, I need you both to stay here

44:15.267 --> 44:17.467

44:17.467 --> 44:20.433

1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:49.867
So.

1:25:51.267 --> 1:25:53.400
North, you reckon?

1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:54.900
Yeah.

1:25:59.900 --> 1:26:01.467
Isabella.

1:26:02.467 --> 1:26:03.900
What?

1:26:05.267 --> 1:26:06.867
My name's Isabella.

1:26:34.067 --> 1:26:36.867
Where did you get it?!
It's brilliant!

1:26:36.867 --> 1:26:38.333
Where did you get it?!

1:26:38.333 --> 1:26:41.333
Hey, where's Charlotte, huh?
Where...

1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:45.233
Alex? Where is everyone?

1:26:47.133 --> 1:26:49.100
Where are the girls, Alex?

1:26:52.567 --> 1:26:53.933
What's going on?

1:26:58.700 --> 1:27:00.500
What's going on, Alex?

1:27:10.067 --> 1:27:11.733
What's happening?

1:27:13.733 --> 1:27:15.300
Put it down.

1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:17.333
Tell me what's happening, Alex.

1:27:19.233 --> 1:27:21.233
And where are you going, Alex?

1:27:21.233 --> 1:27:23.700
Where are you going? Huh?!

1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:25.900
What's happened?!

1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:28.166
What's going on?!

1:29:07.100 --> 1:29:10.067
* Gotta keep your guard up

1:29:10.067 --> 1:29:12.233

1:29:30.567 --> 1:29:32.933
* When the world stops turnin'

1:29:32.933 --> 1:29:35.767
* Spittin' flames at me

1:29:36.900 --> 1:29:39.467
* We're gonna find fire

1:29:39.467 --> 1:29:42.600
