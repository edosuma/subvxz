FOX BROADCASTING COMPANYION,

00:31.298 --> 00:33.298
Brought to you by the
event, where you can drive away

00:33.300 --> 00:35.300
in any new 2012 VW
your signature. just

00:35.302 --> 00:37.002
Good evening. I'm Tom
Tucker bringing you news

00:37.004 --> 00:38.704
you heard four hours
ago on the Internet.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.140
Our top story: A mishap
in Quahog harbor today.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.775
That's right, Tom.

00:42.777 --> 00:43.942
A ferry carrying a shipment

00:43.944 --> 00:46.812
of brand-new Mercedes
Benzes from Germany

00:46.814 --> 00:49.181
crashed and sank just
a few miles off our coast.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.850
Thus far, the cars
remain on the ocean floor

00:51.852 --> 00:54.086
as the Germans refuse
to clean up the disaster.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.654
The German
Environmental Minister

00:55.656 --> 00:57.489
called a press
conference to issue

00:57.491 --> 00:58.657
the following statement:

00:58.659 --> 01:01.693
(thick German accent):
I see nothing! I know nothing!

01:01.695 --> 01:03.495
Holy crap! Did you
hear that, Lois?

01:03.497 --> 01:06.432
All them fancy cars out
free for the taking?just

01:06.434 --> 01:07.866
I'm gonna get me a Mercedes!

01:07.868 --> 01:10.335
Peter, that may be
you've ever had.ea

01:10.337 --> 01:12.838
And you've had some
pretty stupid ones.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.306
Hi there. Peter Griffin.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.042
You know, a lot of us here
at <i>Family Guy</i> are, frankly,

01:17.044 --> 01:19.645
sickened by the sorry state
of education in this country

01:19.647 --> 01:21.647
and how little
you people read anymore.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.583
So, for this next cutaway,
we're gonna make you read it.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.751
That's right, you heard me.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.686
Do a little work
once in a while,

01:27.688 --> 01:29.088
instead of having
everything spoon-fed.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.323
You want your yuks,
put in a little effort.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.658
All right, go ahead.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.212
Okay, that one might
have been more of a visual,

01:53.214 --> 01:55.047
but you feel that feeling
you got right now?

01:55.049 --> 01:57.850
That's satisfaction.
You just read something.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.486
And no one can take
that away from you.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.887
Proud of you.

02:08.761 --> 02:11.096
Geez, you're a mess.
What is that?

02:11.098 --> 02:12.965
It was finger-paint day.
What the hell?

02:12.967 --> 02:15.000
Why didn't they clean
you up before you left?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.969
Brian, there's, like,
37 other kids in there.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.805
One was in a drawer all day.
Wow, seems like
Lois would've

02:19.807 --> 02:21.874
checked that stuff out
before sending you.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.175
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

02:23.177 --> 02:25.010
I mean, it's clearly
not a place of business.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.512
It's someone's house.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.714
You know, half the time you
can hear someone showering.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.683
I mean, you never see them, but
you can hear the shower going.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.652
Really? That seems weird.
Yeah, and is it normal

02:33.654 --> 02:35.654
that Miss Emily tied
us all to the sink

02:35.656 --> 02:37.656
while she went out to
return a birthday present?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.158
No, that's not
normal at all.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.592
You know, Stewie,
maybe I should

02:40.594 --> 02:42.094
come by tomorrow
and check things out.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.862
That teacher sounds
really irresponsible.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.764
She is. Adults are stupid.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.867
The world would be so much
better if it were run by babies.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.869
TV ANNOUNCER:
Tonight on NBC... <i>Shapes!</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:52.471
(excited cooing)

02:52.473 --> 02:54.273
And then... <i>Colors!</i>

02:54.275 --> 02:55.541
(excited cooing)

02:55.543 --> 02:57.776
Followed by
an all-new... <i>Dad's Keys!</i>

02:57.778 --> 02:59.845
(cheering, cooing)

03:01.347 --> 03:03.215
(quiet snoring)

03:07.587 --> 03:09.821
Man, I can't wait
to get a Mercedes.
Me, either.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.723
Yeah, it's gonna be sweet.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.663
What the hell
is that?!
A sun hat.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.199
No, no, no, no, no.
What do you mean, no?

03:20.201 --> 03:22.134
I'm protecting my face
and neck from the sun.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.368
Use sunscreen!
Y-You don't need

03:23.370 --> 03:24.937
to put a circus
on your head.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.505
This is a ploy
for attention.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.839
Sunscreens are
bad for you.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.107
The chemicals get
in your skin.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.842
Boy, you really want
to wear that hat.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.178
That hat's
coming off!
No!

03:33.180 --> 03:35.380
(grunting)

03:38.117 --> 03:39.284
You guys are jerks!

03:39.286 --> 03:41.653
I can have my own identity
besides you two.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.855
Not this way.
Not the hat way.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.726
Holy crap!
I think we got one!

03:49.696 --> 03:51.697
Aw, damn it!
It's just a dolphin.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.698
(with British accent):
Sorry,

03:52.700 --> 03:53.865
did I get in the way
of something?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.434
No, it's all right.
We were just trying

03:55.436 --> 03:56.802
to get some of them
sunken Mercedes.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.471
Oh, yeah, there's
a great big pile
of them down there.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.807
Me and my mates, right,
we was having a laugh

04:01.809 --> 04:03.842
sitting in of one of them,
pretending to be people.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.711
(chuckles)
You know, like, driving around

04:05.713 --> 04:07.646
getting into incidents
with other motorists.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.982
Honk, honk. "Stay out
the way, you old bat!"

04:09.984 --> 04:11.116
Asian.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.652
Not all Asians
are bad drivers.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.654
No, no, not
all terrorists are Arab.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.824
But, you know, they <i>are,</i> so...

04:18.826 --> 04:20.259
Uh, well, I'm Peter,

04:20.261 --> 04:22.461
and that's, uh, Joe,
and that's Quagmire.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.795
Name's Billy, Billy Finn.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.163
It's got "fin" in it.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.498
I didn't pick it.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.833
(chuckles):
Luck of the draw.

04:27.835 --> 04:31.036
Say, you want me to try
and get you one of those cars

04:31.038 --> 04:32.271
from down there, yeah?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.339
(gasps)
You would do that?!

04:34.341 --> 04:35.540
Well, I could try.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.010
Here, let me
give it a go.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.044
He seems nice.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.879
He does.
Yeah.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.683
So, uh, what do you have
planned for the summer?

04:44.685 --> 04:48.186
I'm sure he'll
be right back.

04:48.188 --> 04:51.189
Sorry, mate, all I could get
was this hood ornament.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.858
(gasps)
This is just as good!

04:52.860 --> 04:54.826
Thank you so much!
Hey, you know,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.995
if there's ever anything
I could do for you...

04:56.997 --> 04:58.630
Actually, you could
do something.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.532
You could eat only
dolphin-safe tuna.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.168
Wait, is that the brand
that costs five cents more?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.503
No, I can't do that.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.772
Things ain't so good
in America right now,

05:06.774 --> 05:08.940
which is why
we're all so fat.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.446
What did I tell you, Brian?

05:14.448 --> 05:15.847
It's a nightmare in here.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.416
Oh, my God!

05:26.526 --> 05:28.927
Oh, what happened
to that kid?
He fell off a stool

05:28.929 --> 05:30.529
trying to turn off
Maury Povich.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.097
This is awful!
Where's your teacher?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.266
Probably out back.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.936
Excuse me, are you Miss Emily?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.938
Yeah. Hi. Who are you?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.540
Uh, Brian.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.175
Brian Steel.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.943
I was just
dropping Stewie off.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.546
Oh, yeah! I should
probably go back in there,

05:47.548 --> 05:48.947
see how everyone's
doing, I guess.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.948
Ah, they're fine.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.317
In fact, I see Stewie
reading a book.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.987
Scratch-and-sniff
<i>Lindsay Lohan Goes Jogging.</i>

05:58.157 --> 05:59.925
Oh, God! That's terrible!

05:59.927 --> 06:01.626
Oh, here's a pop-up book.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.762
<i>Tommy Lee Goes Boating.</i>

06:07.834 --> 06:09.768
Move, Lois! You're on
the hood ornament's pillow.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.870
Peter, put that away.
It's time for bed.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.872
W-Wait, hang on, Lois,
before I go to bed,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.407
I just got
to do one thing.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.445
Hello?
Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
it's me, Peter.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.281
You remember how you said
I'd never amount to nothing?

06:24.250 --> 06:25.584
Is that a Mercedes?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.252
Peter, hang up
the phone.
(doorbell rings)

06:27.254 --> 06:29.688
My God, who could be at
the door at this hour?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.524
I don't know, but this late,
it's got to be bad news.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.426
Everyone knows you
always get bad news

06:34.428 --> 06:35.861
in the middle of the night.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.798
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Huh? What?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.299
You have cancer!
What?!

06:41.301 --> 06:42.667
Yeah. I thought
you should know.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.703
Okay, go back to sleep.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.804
Wait, I have questions.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.774
(sighs)
It's <i>very</i> late.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.843
Oh, hello. This
is the right house.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.211
(chuckles)
That's good, then.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.546
What the hell?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.248
It's me, Billy. Billy Finn.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.418
Just wanted to take you up
on your nice offer from earlier.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.820
What... I-I don't... What offer?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.288
(snickers)
You know, the bit about

07:03.290 --> 07:05.490
"If there's ever
anything I can do,"

07:05.492 --> 07:08.126
so, yeah...
Oh.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.796
Yeah, thought I might
make a go of it on land.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.798
So, "anything you
can ever do."

07:12.800 --> 07:15.167
Here I am. Thank you.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.968
Squid pro quo.
(chuckles)

07:16.970 --> 07:19.371
Thank you for not
being "shellfish."

07:19.373 --> 07:21.673
(giggles)
I just said that
for the "halibut."

07:21.675 --> 07:24.676
(laughs)
Fish puns.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.445
Ah. Oh, cod.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.380
(laughing)

07:28.382 --> 07:29.915
Oh, God, come on.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.650
(grunts)
Let me in.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.518
Peter, who is it?
Is Meg dead?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.854
It's that dolphin--
I think he wants to crash here.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.856
And I have no info on Meg.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.857
He wants to what?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.258
I-I'm not sure that...

07:40.260 --> 07:41.593
I brought a gift.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.196
Put it to your ear.
You can hear the ocean.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.664
♪ Caribbean Queen

07:45.666 --> 07:48.300
♪ Now we're sharing...
It's broken or something.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.502
All I hear is...
It's <i>Billy</i> Ocean!

07:50.504 --> 07:52.504
(cackling)

07:52.506 --> 07:54.473
Oh, God! I got
loads more.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.943
I think you and I are gonna
have a lot of fun together.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.686
So, Billy, I, uh, I hope
the couch was all right?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.287
Yeah, a lot better
than the floor.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.756
And I should know, 'cause
I went down on the floor,

08:11.758 --> 08:14.493
thinking it had to be a
lot better than the couch.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.928
Okay, well,
breakfast is ready.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.196
Oh. Uh...

08:18.198 --> 08:20.198
Is everything all right?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.667
Yeah. Well, it's just...

08:22.669 --> 08:25.770
would you mind tossing
it up in the air for me?
Well, I don't know...

08:25.772 --> 08:27.372
Lois, he is our guest.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.274
Toss it in the air.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.847
Uh, I'm used to a
little applause, so...

08:35.849 --> 08:37.849
(faint clapping)

08:37.851 --> 08:38.917
All right, all right.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.519
Not bad. Afternoon crowd.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.787
Lightly attended.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.756
So, Billy, how long will
you be staying with us?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.424
Are you kidding?
As long as he wants!

08:46.426 --> 08:48.693
Yay! We live with a dolphin!

08:48.695 --> 08:50.595
Correct, fatso.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.298
Anyway, I'm off
to read Meg's diary.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.701
Only been here one night,
but I get the sense
we all dislike Meg.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.639
Um, I'm a dolphin--
smart, intuitive.

09:00.641 --> 09:04.276
Also, Peter told me
in the hall. Ha.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.778
Peter, I'm not so sure about
Billy staying here with us.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.147
What are you talking
about? He's hilarious.
I don't know.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.616
Listen, just leave it to me.
I'm great with animals.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.385
Remember when I lived
with those ants?

09:14.687 --> 09:17.222
We're working on something.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.863
Yes? May I help you?

09:24.865 --> 09:25.997
Hey, put him down!

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
Who are you?
I-I can't stop him!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.267
Can anyone stop him?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.002
No? Well, he's gone.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.671
Hey, Stewie.
How's it going?

09:32.673 --> 09:35.874
Brian, what are
you doing here?
Came by to check on my pal.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.842
Where's, uh, Miss Emily?
I haven't seen
her yet today.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.445
She gave me the keys to open
up when she left yesterday.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.480
I thought you said you
were gonna talk to her.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.516
I did, a-and she's doing
her best, you know?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.184
She's got a lot
on her plate.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.786
She's got school.
She's got work.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.154
This is her work!

09:49.156 --> 09:50.422
Oh, hi, Brian.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.091
I thought you had a busy day
at your legal practice.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.793
(groans) Oh...

09:54.795 --> 09:56.828
Hey, Emily! Yeah, I had
some time between cases.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
I thought I'd see
how you were doing.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.432
That's so nice of you!

10:00.434 --> 10:02.334
Let me just put
these bags away

10:02.336 --> 10:05.670
and throw some saltines
in the yard for the kids.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.607
You're disgusting.
Hey, I'm sorry,
but Miss Emily and I

10:08.609 --> 10:10.775
have a connection, which
is totally unexpected.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.145
And by the way,
I actually think she's
doing a pretty good job.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.747
She's teaching you
guys independence.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.015
We're one!

10:17.017 --> 10:18.984
Independence means we die!

10:18.986 --> 10:20.852
Do you like this?
I just got it.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.754
Say you like it, or
she's gonna spend

10:22.756 --> 10:24.990
the rest of the afternoon
outreturning that stuff.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.825
Looks great!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.760
Wow, you really
fill these things up.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.363
Hey, do you think maybe you'd
want to hang out sometime?

10:31.365 --> 10:33.264
What, you mean like
a movie or something?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.699
Yeah, or-or maybe lunch?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.268
I had a bad experience last
time I went to the movies.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.937
We're good friends,
aren't we, Milo?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.772
We're best friends, Otis.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.173
No! No!

10:42.175 --> 10:44.209
I reject the premise of this!

10:47.179 --> 10:49.948
Okay, who's ready for
Family Movie Night?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.349
All right, tonight's selection:

10:51.351 --> 10:54.152
Tim Burton's
<i>Alice in Wonderland</i> in 3D.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.521
Now let's all sit down
and take our headache.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.522
Or...

10:57.524 --> 10:58.657
or-or...

10:58.659 --> 11:01.092
we could
watch...
<i>The Cove,</i>

11:01.094 --> 11:02.293
The Cove?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.995
Isn't that that
horrible documentary

11:03.997 --> 11:05.330
where they kill
all the fish?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.931
Dolphins, actually.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.767
Well, yeah, but this one
was in the video store

11:08.769 --> 11:09.934
under "Ethan's Picks."

11:09.936 --> 11:11.169
Come on, Peter.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.804
Billy's our guest.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.939
(sighs) All right,
we'll watch <i>The Cove.</i>

11:16.475 --> 11:18.009
(men shouting in Japanese,
splashing and thumping)

11:18.011 --> 11:19.010
Oh, my God!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.111
I don't want to see this!

11:20.113 --> 11:21.479
I know you can't tell this,

11:21.481 --> 11:22.681
but the one who's about
to get her throat cut,

11:22.683 --> 11:25.216
she's sorta hot.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.655
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

11:30.657 --> 11:32.757
What do you think
I'm doing?
You're stoolin'?

11:32.759 --> 11:34.426
What, you gotta
do that in here?

11:34.428 --> 11:36.494
Well, where else am I
supposed to do it?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.763
I can't just do it
on the floor, can I?

11:38.765 --> 11:42.200
You'd be all, like,
"Ooh, who left this coil
of rope on the floor?"

11:42.202 --> 11:44.335
It's very... comes out
very ropey is my point.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.438
But I gotta take a bath.
Go on, then.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.472
We're both men.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.008
Well... all right,
I guess.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.376
There you go!

11:51.378 --> 11:53.678
(hearty laugh)
Look at that!

11:53.680 --> 11:54.879
What is...

11:54.881 --> 11:56.614
Whoa! Solar eclipse.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.816
Blocking the sun.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.318
Do not look directly
at it. (laughs)

12:00.320 --> 12:01.519
Wh-Wha-What the hell?

12:01.521 --> 12:02.587
What're you doin'?

12:02.589 --> 12:03.688
I'm just making
a comment.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.690
Um, need to
know somethin'.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.359
Do you hear the word
"morbidly" a lot?

12:08.361 --> 12:09.994
This is not fair.
O-O-Okay.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.429
And, again, I'm gonna
ask one more question,

12:11.431 --> 12:12.530
and don't take this
the wrong way,

12:12.532 --> 12:15.834
but have you actually
got a penis?
Yes.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.168
Where-where is it?
Where is it?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.837
It's in there.
Are you sure?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.672
So it's like Mr.
Snuffleupagus, is it?

12:20.674 --> 12:22.273
Aw, the hell with this.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.175
Lois, get the ruler,
we're measuring again.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.878
And this time, <i>I</i> decide
where the base is.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.682
So then I'm reading
the funnies,

12:30.684 --> 12:32.784
and right before I get
to the last panel,

12:32.786 --> 12:34.652
Billy blurts out,
he goes, he goes,

12:34.654 --> 12:37.655
"You know, those firemen showed
up to get a cat out of the tree,

12:37.657 --> 12:39.858
but it turns out it's really
Marmaduke up there."

12:39.860 --> 12:41.526
It ruined the whole damn thing!

12:41.528 --> 12:44.763
Peter, in Billy's defense,
the strip is called <i>Marmaduke,</i>

12:44.765 --> 12:46.931
and Marmaduke
had not yet made
an appearance.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.833
You probably should've
seen that coming.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.201
I tell ya, he was fun at first,

12:50.203 --> 12:52.837
but now I'm not sure I can take
much more of him living here.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.673
Well, Peter, you've more than
paid back your debt to him.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.674
I mean, what did he do?

12:56.676 --> 12:57.976
He-he got you a hood ornament.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.111
If you ask me,
it's time for him to go.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.179
Yeah, you're right.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.680
Plus, the sooner
we get him out of here,

13:02.682 --> 13:05.650
the sooner I can get back
to my cocaine and dollhouses.

13:05.652 --> 13:08.086
(long, loud snorting noise)

13:15.127 --> 13:16.127
(rings bell)

13:16.129 --> 13:17.695
Dinner is served.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.531
(small excited squeal)

13:19.533 --> 13:21.266
Get out!

13:22.835 --> 13:24.302
(panting)

13:24.304 --> 13:25.537
Stewie, what's going on?

13:25.539 --> 13:26.671
Aren't you supposed
to be at day care?

13:26.673 --> 13:29.440
I escaped.
What happened to your arm?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.809
I finally stood up for all of us

13:30.811 --> 13:32.677
and told Miss Emily we should
be given a proper lunch

13:32.679 --> 13:34.512
and not just what's left over
from her Baja Fresh.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.481
And she said
I shouldn't raise my voice

13:36.483 --> 13:38.483
and pulled me really hard
into the other room,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.485
and my arm came
out of its socket.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.686
Are you sure?

13:41.688 --> 13:43.822
Are you sure you didn't
just sleep on it funny?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.657
Does this look like
I slept on it funny?!

13:45.659 --> 13:46.658
I'm gonna tell Mom!

13:46.660 --> 13:47.659
Mom!

13:47.661 --> 13:48.993
You are not going anywhere.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.162
I finally have a date
with Miss Emily tomorrow,

13:51.164 --> 13:52.931
and I'm not gonna let you
or anybody else get in my way

13:52.933 --> 13:55.033
until I have seen
every inch of her naked.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.434
Do you even hear yourself?!

13:56.436 --> 13:58.169
And what am I supposed
to do about my arm?!

13:58.171 --> 13:59.437
I'll just pop it back in.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.772
You most certainly will not!

14:00.774 --> 14:02.340
I need to go to a hospital.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.309
LOIS: Brian, is Stewie
in there with you?

14:04.311 --> 14:05.677
Mom!

14:05.679 --> 14:07.478
We're in here, Lois.
He's napping.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.647
Relax. I'm gonna
pop it back in.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.716
(muffled grunting)

14:14.753 --> 14:17.355
Get in there! C-Come on!
Hold still, Stewie!

14:17.357 --> 14:18.590
(both grunting)

14:18.592 --> 14:20.525
(shoulder popping)

14:20.527 --> 14:22.694
(coughing)

14:22.696 --> 14:24.863
I'm not saying
I like pain.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.565
But I'm not saying
I don't like it either.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.505
Hey, uh, listen, Billy, it's
been fun having you stay here,

14:34.507 --> 14:37.542
but we really need to talk about
making some new arrangements.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.710
Oh, do we?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.545
Is this because there's
some kind of problem

14:40.547 --> 14:41.546
with the hood ornament?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.513
No, that's... it's...

14:42.515 --> 14:44.082
that's... it's-it's fine.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.650
Oh, good, good.
That's good to hear,

14:45.652 --> 14:48.086
'cause it dawned on me
that the only thing better than

14:48.088 --> 14:50.855
you having one of them would
be you having two of them.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.690
Don't you say those things.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.826
Don't you say those things
unless they're true.

14:54.828 --> 14:55.994
Yeah, be quite a thing

14:55.996 --> 14:57.695
for you to have two of them,
wouldn't it?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.197
Would it ever!

15:03.202 --> 15:04.202
Wonderful!

15:04.204 --> 15:05.270
The best!

15:05.272 --> 15:06.671
Very fancy!

15:08.807 --> 15:12.143
Now, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

15:12.145 --> 15:13.144
Nothing, nothing.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.212
(knocking)

15:16.148 --> 15:17.148
Tricia Takanawa?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.449
What are you doing here?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.419
Peter, I'm standing here
on your front porch,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.689
hoping to kill that dolphin
with this harpoon.

15:24.691 --> 15:29.427
MAN (singing):

15:35.000 --> 15:37.869
So the thing about dolphin
lullabies is that they're all

15:37.871 --> 15:40.004
in the key of
"eee-eee"!

15:40.006 --> 15:41.873
(laughing)

15:41.875 --> 15:42.840
"Eee"!

15:42.842 --> 15:44.809
(laughing)

15:44.811 --> 15:45.777
That's loud.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.145
I get why
that's factual.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.613
I don't see
why it's funny.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.749
(laughing)
Eh-eh! What the hell, man?!

15:51.751 --> 15:53.751
Drink beer much?
(laughs)

15:53.753 --> 15:56.621
I just learned that
"much" thing from the telly.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.655
Hey, here's a question:

15:57.657 --> 15:59.190
When are you going
back to the ocean?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.859
Yeah, I mean,
don't you have
family back there?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.995
I used to, but not anymore.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.464
Um, the wife won't
have me back.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.765
Threw me out, actually.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.334
Well, maybe you
should talk to her.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.303
Peter, believe me, if she'd take
me back, I'd go in a second.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.040
But she won't, so as much
as I love her, moot point.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.542
Moving on.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.143
Uh... (clears throat)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.813
Well, gotta go
and drain the eel.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.780
It's electric.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.183
(laughing):
My penis.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.419
BILLY:
Hey, throw darts much?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.021
(laughing)

16:30.023 --> 16:31.422
Boy, I see what
you're saying, Peter.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.623
Billy's annoying.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.858
Yeah, and P.S.,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.494
that guy doesn't throw
darts much. He's new.

16:39.765 --> 16:43.001
Peter, I thought you said you
were gonna ask Billy to leave.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.869
He's still sleeping
on the couch out there.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.304
I know, Lois, but I found out

16:46.306 --> 16:47.972
he's only here
'cause his wife kicked him out.

16:47.974 --> 16:51.609
So I figured out a way to kill
two birds with one stone.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.444
(chirping)
Like this.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.080
The key to that, Lois,
is big rock, small birds.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.682
Oh, and I also figured out

16:57.684 --> 16:59.817
how to achieve two goals
with one action.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.453
See, I'm gonna help Billy
get back together with his wife,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.522
and then he'll move out
and stop annoying us.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.656
How do you plan to do that?

17:05.658 --> 17:06.958
Are you kidding?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.359
I'm great at getting
people back together.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.028
I even recorded a song about it.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.130
("Reunited" intro playing)

Hey, guys.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.462
Everybody having
fun playing with...

17:44.464 --> 17:45.830
What-what is that?

17:45.832 --> 17:48.933
A piece of wood with a,
with a nail in it. Neat.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.001
He can't hear you.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.636
There was a kitchen
explosion today,

17:51.638 --> 17:52.970
and half the kids are deaf.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.939
Oh, hi, Brian.
Hey, Emily.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.107
Wow, you look great.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.275
You're ready to go?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.309
Yeah, one sec.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.610
I'm leaving, honey.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.145
Okay, babe, have fun.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.981
I'm probably just gonna take
a couple more showers.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.349
Who-who was that?

18:05.351 --> 18:06.751
That's my boyfriend, Devin.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.819
Are you ready for lunch?

18:09.855 --> 18:12.657
RADIO DISPATCHER: 11-25,
Code 6, 105 North Avenue...

18:12.659 --> 18:14.125
What you did
to these kids...

18:14.127 --> 18:17.695
There is a special place
in hell for people like you.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.534
Come on, let's go home.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.336
Man, when she
gets to jail,

18:25.338 --> 18:27.205
she's gonna be
major lez-chow.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.675
She sure is, Stewie.
She sure is.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.780
I'm telling you, Peter,
you're wasting your time.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.315
She's never taking me back.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.850
Well, you'll never
know until you try.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.586
Hey, I brought this sack
of garbage from my home.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.187
Where do I put this?
Just anywhere?

18:43.189 --> 18:44.856
Yeah. Anywhere.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.860
Yay, people!

18:48.862 --> 18:50.261
All right, here she comes.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.330
Oh, hello, Joanne.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.798
Billy?! What are
you doing here?

18:53.800 --> 18:57.502
He's here because he loves you,
and he wants to patch things up.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.270
Hey, how come
you ain't got boobs?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.005
You like a runner
or something?

19:01.007 --> 19:02.173
Who's this, then?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.774
He's just a friend,
trying to help.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.010
Look, Billy,
I don't care

19:06.012 --> 19:09.814
what you or your fat friend
here has to say, it's over.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.850
(sighs) Well, thanks
for trying.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.785
I knew she wouldn't
listen to you, though.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.487
Well, maybe so.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.657
But I know someone
she'll <i>have</i> to listen to.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.192
Hey, gang,
I'm Aquaman.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.660
Get back together.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.762
Boop-boop-boop-boop-
boop-boop-boop.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.597
That's not
Aquaman!

19:26.599 --> 19:28.032
Billy, what
is going on?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.200
Let me answer that.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.036
Look, Joanne, Billy had
nothing to do with this.

19:32.038 --> 19:35.273
It was just a dumb plan my
buddies and I put together

19:35.275 --> 19:37.508
because we know how
much Billy loves you.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.377
And he misses you very much.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
Look, just give him
another chance.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.849
And if you won't do it
for me, do it for Fish Jesus.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.851
Do you have Fish Jesus?
Of course.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.587
He was nailed to a board
and hung in a man's study

19:49.589 --> 19:51.956
as a novelty to
sing funny songs.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.292
Your god is a gag gift,
did you know that?

19:54.294 --> 19:55.893
Would you excuse us?

19:56.695 --> 19:59.030
Is it true, Billy?

19:59.032 --> 20:00.531
Do you really miss me?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.266
Joanne, I am so sorry.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.668
I promise
I'll do better.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.670
You know what?
I had to live on the land

20:05.672 --> 20:08.139
to learn there might
be a million fish in the sea,

20:08.141 --> 20:10.141
but there's only one you.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.176
Oh, Billy...

20:17.416 --> 20:19.083
Aw, look at that.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.252
That's nice.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.155
Oh, cool, they're
already using my garbage!

20:29.194 --> 20:31.429
Hey, Brian, thanks for helping
get rid of Miss Emily.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.630
Although I've got to say,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.632
my new preschool teacher
is even hotter.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.633
Really?
Yeah.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.968
Let me know if you
want his number.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.670
Oh, you!

20:39.672 --> 20:41.005
Okay, now just
stay like this

20:41.007 --> 20:43.040
and let Peter and Lois
finish their thing.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.276
Wow, Peter, you did
a really nice thing

20:45.278 --> 20:47.645
helping Billy get back
together with his wife.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.314
Yeah, and the best part
is, he's out of the house
and back in the ocean.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.683
I guess everything
worked out for everybody.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.755
Arr! 'Tis a mighty haul!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.357
Hey.
Oh.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.692
Yeah, it's me as Neptune.

21:04.830 --> 21:08.899
