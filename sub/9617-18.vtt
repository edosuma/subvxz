♪♪

00:06.007 --> 00:10.242
Hi. Welcome back to
another year of
spine-tingling terror.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.511
You said, "no terror."

00:12.513 --> 00:15.447
But doy, it's our
<i>halloween scary time theater</i> .

00:15.449 --> 00:17.816
I don't want it to be
called that.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.518
Well, what do you
want it to be called?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.919
<i>Doy story.</i>

00:22.123 --> 00:24.556
That movie isn't actually called
<i>doy story</i> , it's called--

00:24.558 --> 00:27.593
-(cry screaming)
-okay.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.329
I'm the scarecrow from
<i>the wizard of oz.</i>

00:30.331 --> 00:32.364
I'm the cowardoy lion.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.899
Oh, come on.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.203
(knocking)

00:37.204 --> 00:40.506
We're also expecting
one more person
from the land of oz.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.245
(laughs) yeah, nobody's
buying that for a second.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.447
Where's your broom, topy?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.918
(knocking)

00:54.922 --> 00:56.655
There you are.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.324
Hello, my boys.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.361
Okay, so we're
hosting this thing?

01:02.363 --> 01:03.629
Where are the people?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.265
They're watching us
from right out there.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.866
Hi.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.602
I'm not actually like this.
They just write me this way.

01:10.604 --> 01:15.340
In real life,
i'm a sweet little girl
just trying to get by.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.242
Curtsy to fool them.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.528
Ava...

01:19.529 --> 01:21.813
Did i read
the stage directions
out loud again?

01:21.816 --> 01:23.515
All the time.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.452
Ugh! She says, frustrated.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.723
Tonight's
first tale of terror

01:31.725 --> 01:34.393
Is about my sister's
favorite place in the world.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.694
Her bay window.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.529
That doesn't sound scary.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.730
It's haunted.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.365
Oh, no!

01:40.367 --> 01:43.702
Let's go see the scary,
horrible ghost.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.572
I'll stay right here
where it's safe.

01:49.543 --> 01:54.279
(screams)

01:54.281 --> 01:55.848
What are these
costumes again?

01:55.850 --> 01:58.100
-We're flappers.
-Why?

01:58.101 --> 02:00.351
Well, i was lying my bed
last night thinking about
what we could be

02:00.354 --> 02:02.654
When i heard a voice
in my head that said--

02:02.656 --> 02:05.007
Ghost:
You should be flappers.

02:05.008 --> 02:07.359
So, i said to
the voice in my head,
"what are flappers?"

02:07.361 --> 02:08.760
And then the voice said--

02:08.762 --> 02:10.329
Ghost:
We were jazz babies.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.830
Jazz babies!

02:11.832 --> 02:13.298
Uh, ri-- riley...

02:13.300 --> 02:14.433
I want to be
a jazz baby.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.968
I can hear
the voice in your head!

02:15.970 --> 02:18.270
This takes our friendship
to a new level.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.942
I lived in the 1920s.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.012
Jazz babies were fun-loving,
dance-all-night gals

02:27.014 --> 02:29.648
With a song in our heart
and taps on our toes.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.952
She is just a cutie pie, maya.
I want to hug her.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.787
She's a 100-year-old
dead ghost lady.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.424
So scream?

02:39.426 --> 02:41.426
Big one!

02:41.427 --> 02:43.427
Yeah, get the scream
out of the way
so we can be chums.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.899
Chums. I don't even feel like
screaming at her anymore.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.736
How about now?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.504
Yeah, now's good.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.440
Both:
(scream)

02:55.442 --> 02:56.959
Now chums?

02:56.960 --> 02:58.477
-Sure. Nice job.
-Very ghosty.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.611
Thanks.

(spooky voice)
i am the ghost
of the bay window.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.476
(chuckles) it's okay, honey.
You can take it down a notch.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.578
Yeah, ya ain't gonna
beat the head thing.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
(normal voice)
you didn't like
my spooky voice?

04:08.582 --> 04:13.085
(spooky voice)
it was a little big.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.523
(crying)

04:18.525 --> 04:20.626
Oh, no.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.427
Maya, i upset the ghost.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.430
It's the first thing
anybody's said to me

04:25.432 --> 04:26.965
In 100 years,
and it was kinda mean.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.504
Yeah, she's
the mean one of us.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.506
No, i'm sorry.
You were just--

04:34.508 --> 04:36.508
You're the best ghost ever.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.044
You mean that?
Because i really like you guys.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.296
You do?

04:41.297 --> 04:43.547
I've been watching you
in this window since you were
very little girls.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.684
That's crazy. We would have
known you were here.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.019
Yeah. Prove it.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.554
She's not the mean one.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.456
She was here!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.225
You know me.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.927
My best fwend
is tough and cool.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.763
I'm scawed of evwything.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.699
I wanna do evwything wif you.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.835
Oh, my gosh, maya.
She's been watching us
for weeks.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.638
You're becoming
wonderful young adults.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.974
Thank you, ghosty.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.476
Is that why this window
is so powerful in our lives?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.545
Because you've been
here watching us?

05:14.581 --> 05:16.581
I used to live
in this house.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.550
This was my bedroom.

05:18.552 --> 05:22.254
I planned my capers here,
i hatched my schemes.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.522
We do that.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.023
-I hatch.
-I scheme.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.958
But, it's more than that.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.126
This place...

05:28.128 --> 05:29.861
It has, like...

05:29.863 --> 05:31.163
A spirit.

05:31.165 --> 05:35.901
I promised i would never
leave until someone else
finally realized

05:35.903 --> 05:38.637
How wonderful it was
to sit in this window

05:38.639 --> 05:40.572
And laugh and cry and dance.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.909
Well, then you're free
to go out in the world
because that's all we do.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.677
Bye-bye.
Don't forget your head.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.514
I can't go yet.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.049
I haven't seen you dance.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.552
Dance for no reason?

05:53.554 --> 05:56.188
Jazz babies dance.
We did the charleston.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.624
That's where you put your hands
like this and switch knees.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.992
We don't know
how to do the charleston.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.527
Do the charleston right now.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.695
But there's no music.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.232
(20s music plays)

06:14.308 --> 06:16.074
Maya, we're flapping.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.909
Riley, we're puppets
of the flapper ghost.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.645
That's crazy.
Nobody can control us.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.601
That's nothing.
I make you do that every week.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.969
-No, you don't.
-Dance.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.642
Is this why i'm so tired
all the time.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.746
Well, it's gonna take
a lot more than that
to control me, sister.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.517

07:42.478 --> 07:44.228
She ghosted us,
and we don't know
how to get rid of her.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.965
Hey, little guy.
Why do you keep saying "doy?"

07:46.967 --> 07:49.801
It's his name.
Just go with it.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.369
How do you spell that?

07:51.371 --> 07:53.638
D-e-w-e-y.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.640
Doy. The "w" is silent.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.742
Oh, honey.
I think it's pronounced--

07:57.744 --> 07:58.810
I wouldn't.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.911
Dewey.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.347
(screams)

08:06.086 --> 08:07.319
Nice work.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.721
Doy:
Doy!

08:10.691 --> 08:11.923
Boy, am i glad that's over.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.958
Dance.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.227
(20s music plays)

08:22.202 --> 08:25.070
In our next story,
we go from this haunted house

08:25.072 --> 08:27.239
To another haunted house.

08:27.241 --> 08:32.811
Yeah! Riley and maya go to
the central park spooktacular!

08:32.813 --> 08:36.448
And we're gonna trick people
into giving us a treat.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.818
I don't think that's
the spirit of halloween, ava.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.687
Are the streets filled
with free sugar?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.423
Yes, m'love.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.459
Do we got
baby-face the lion boy?

08:47.461 --> 08:50.795
One of the great trick or treat
faces of our generation.

08:50.797 --> 08:54.232
Doy, show us your candymaker.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.036
Oh, am i gonna
get sick tonight.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.075
All right, topanga.
So, are you gonna go

09:04.077 --> 09:05.877
Trick or treating
with these kids,

09:05.879 --> 09:08.313
Or are you gonna go
to the haunted house
with those kids?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.981
We don't need
adult supervision anymore.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.883
We're becoming
wonderful young adults.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.251
-Says who?
-The ghost of the bay window.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.887
Oh, the ghost
of the bay window.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.957
When you guys
go to sleep, she floats in.
She goes, "boo."

09:18.959 --> 09:20.792
We go, "aah."

09:20.794 --> 09:23.261
We all laugh and discuss
the way ghosts are portrayed
in the media.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.131
Are you making fun of us?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.266
-Pretty sure we are.
-No, we are.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.903
Okay, do you want to go
to the haunted house
with these dumb-heads?

09:33.273 --> 09:35.774
Well, then i will go
trick or treating
with these guys.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.844
(screams)

09:44.084 --> 09:45.784
I'm going trick or treating,
huh, doy?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.385
You know you want to.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.354
Oh, i do.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.123
Okay, fine. Then i will go
with these girls.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.825
You guys love me, right?

09:53.827 --> 09:54.926
To pieces, topanga.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.027
Yeah, me too.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.128
Thank you.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.403
See, mom? All kids.
You know why?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.939
Because you don't go
to a creepy haunted house
with your mommy.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.558
It simply isn't done.

10:09.559 --> 10:11.176
Oh, yeah. You guys are
talking all brave now,

10:11.178 --> 10:13.345
But you're gonna go in there
and be scared to death
without me.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.814
(laughing)

10:15.816 --> 10:17.315
That was fun.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.985
I liked the zombie
who tried to eat my guts.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.087
I wasn't scared at all.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.023
(screams)

10:25.025 --> 10:27.859
Cory, did you go into
the haunted house
with three little kids?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.527
I wasn't gonna
go in there alone.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.864
Listen, topanga,
why don't you come with us?
The girls will be fine.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.033
Look, just because this is
a fun-looking haunted house,

10:35.035 --> 10:36.968
And there's
a security guard named larry

10:36.970 --> 10:39.037
Doesn't mean i feel comfortable
just leaving you here.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.972
I mean, who knows
what kind of kids
hang out here?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.974
Hey, bacon. Tomato.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.211
Could you please
tell my friend's mom
it's okay to leave us here?

10:46.213 --> 10:48.546
Yeah, we're pretty good kids.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.882
Who doesn't feel safe
with a tomato?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.120
Hold the phone.
Are you who i think you are?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.855
Who says, "hold the phone?"

10:56.857 --> 11:00.892
I do... When i want somebody
to hold my phone.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.195
Hey, lady. Take a picture
of me with austin moon.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.197
Ava, that's ally dawson.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.366
Hey, ally dawson,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.368
Take a picture of me
with austin moon!

11:11.571 --> 11:12.837
(camera phone clicks)

11:12.839 --> 11:13.972
How you doin'?

11:13.974 --> 11:19.177
Ha. Well, i can appreciate
a girl who knows what she wants.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.146
Take me away, gorgeous.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.948
Where does that
beautiful blonde head
of yours call home?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.216
Florida.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.885
This relationship is over.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.421
Oh, no!

11:29.423 --> 11:31.022
So you're a new york
kind of gal?

11:31.024 --> 11:33.591
I guess so.
Here's your wallet back.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.427
Huh.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.931
I think we'll be
okay here, mom.
Look around.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.132
What do you think, cory?

11:41.134 --> 11:44.636
I think ava's
the scariest one here.

11:44.638 --> 11:47.639
And we're happy to hang
with these two jazz babies.

11:47.641 --> 11:51.076
-Well, thank you very much.
-New best friends. Bye-bye.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.377
All right.
I just want you home by--

11:52.379 --> 11:54.646
Don't say a time.
I want to be cool.

11:54.648 --> 11:55.980
Then i won't.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.083
Then i'm very cool.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.118
10:00.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.520
But that's when
the monster parade starts.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.322
It starts at 10:00?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.360
Do you wanna go
trick or treating, doy?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.029
What did you just call me?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.297
Doy.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.167
(laughs) let's go.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.071
Ava, i need my wallet back.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.741
Thanks a lot, guys.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.476
But you don't actually
have to watch us or anything.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.878
I mean, lucas and farkle are
already on their way

12:26.879 --> 12:29.279
And it's not like we're
a couple of scared kids
at a haunted house.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.086
-Hi.
-Both: (scream)

12:37.057 --> 12:39.390
If you're scared of her,
i don't think you'll do
too good in there.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.426
She is a ghost
and she will ghost you.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.529
Yes, do it. Ghost them
like they've never been ghosted.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.499
I want you to
take me back home.
I'm scared.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.002
Yeah. This is a ghost.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.004
What are you scared of?

12:53.005 --> 12:55.005
Promise me you won't let
our house become like this one.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.108
Please tell me
what's bothering you.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.111
It bothers me that
this is the haunted house.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.613
You don't think
it looks authentic?

13:01.615 --> 13:05.283
Oh, it's real authentic.
I know the ghost
who lives here.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.019
Oh, really? (chuckles)

13:08.021 --> 13:09.871
Look, i know it's halloween,

13:09.872 --> 13:11.722
But this ghost is about as real
as the fake zombies inside.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.025
Oh, do not doubt
her ghostiness.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.996
Oh, please.
What can she do?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.333
Oh, would you look at that?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.969
She is a ghost.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.972
And she's got style.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.309
Everybody used to know
this house.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.411
This is
my best friend tessie's house.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.980
We'd all come here
to dance the night away.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.382
Tessie was
the life of the party.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.250
But look at
the place now.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.052
Why is it like this?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.988
Nobody's hatched any schemes
or planned any capers

13:43.990 --> 13:45.490
In the bay window
of this house

13:45.492 --> 13:47.158
The way you have in ours.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.127
So nobody lives here now.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.662
Only tessie.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.764
The party's been over
for a long time.

13:52.766 --> 13:55.066
She just sits,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.602
Staring out at a world
that's forgotten all about us.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.039
Austin, are you crying?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.042
(in british accent) no.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.013
Where's tessie now?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.715
Oh, she's in there...

14:10.717 --> 14:12.584
By herself in the bay window.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.652
Is there any way
we can help?

14:14.654 --> 14:17.789
Well, there is one thing
tessie could never resist.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.591
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.526
Dance again. Yay!

14:22.462 --> 14:24.629

Please come love us.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.233
Hey, we flapped
for you, casper.
Get out here.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.068
This is not like her at all.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.738
Well, maybe her not coming out
is her way of inviting us in.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.274
No, no. If she didn't
come out for dancing,

15:09.276 --> 15:11.542
Tessie is not
in the mood for company.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.741
Oh!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.410
-Thank you!
-We had a lovely evening.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.249
Tessie's changed, man.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.418
It's been real, ghosty.
Happy halloween.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.696
Okay, everybody
pour out your candy.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.664
Why? Everybody has
their own pumpkin.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.303
Yeah, but i like
dividing it all up fairly.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.238
Well, well, well...

16:14.240 --> 16:16.441
Topanga's wrong about you,
ava morgenstern.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.542
No, she's not.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.379
Mini, mini, full size.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.248
Toothbrush, toothbrush,
crunch bar.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.818
Skip turn, skip turn, uh.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.553
Uh, let's just speed this up.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.794
Pleasure doing business
with you, boys.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.797
-Good night.
-Good night.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.199
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.834
The haunted house
freak you out?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.235
A little too haunted
for me, thank you.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.237
I can't believe
you just left us there.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.176
Trick or treat.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.212
Excuse me, doy?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.613
Didn't you just go
trick or treating?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.281
Ava happened.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.853
Topy, i'm crashing bad, man!

17:01.855 --> 17:04.322
I'm sleeping over.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.557
(snoring)

17:10.897 --> 17:13.231
Trick or treat.
Help a doy out.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.267
Oh, i'm sorry, doy,
but we don't have any candy.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.201
You don't?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.303
-Nope.
-Then trick.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.789
Excuse me?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.274
If you don't have any candy,
then i'm forced to do
a trick on you.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.244
Oh, really?

17:26.245 --> 17:28.212
You want stinky feet
or surprise?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.848
Well, which one
do you want, maya?

17:30.850 --> 17:33.284
I mean, who doesn't like
a nice surprise, right?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.585
Do your worst.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.922
Doy!

17:37.924 --> 17:39.323
Both:
(scream)

17:39.325 --> 17:41.526
-Do you feel anything?
-Pretend.

17:41.528 --> 17:46.564
Both:
Oooh! Eeeh! Aaah! Arg!

17:46.566 --> 17:50.334
Nice job.
Wanna eat ava's candy?

17:50.336 --> 17:51.936
Don't mind if i doy.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.240
That was kinda cute.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.809
Doy put a spell on us.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.377
What could he possibly
think of to do to us?

17:59.379 --> 18:00.745
He's six years old
like auggie.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.247
There's nothing
in their heads
except cartoons.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.285
Uh, riley?

18:07.287 --> 18:10.621
Maya, you got real tall.
Yay!

18:11.724 --> 18:14.425
And now you're a cartoon.
I love our lives.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.260
Riley, is this
really happening,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.296
Or is everything
in your head
just coming out?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.665
No, i still got
stuff in my head.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.270
What's in your head?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.307
-Don't do this.
-Don't do that.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.476
-Be like me.
-Today is the best day ever.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.978
All:
Peaches!

18:33.980 --> 18:36.414
Oh, my gosh.
I have never felt better
in my life.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.615
Let's go rob a bank.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.417
Quick, back in her head.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.585
After you.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.421
-No, after you.
-Please, i insist.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.722
-After you.
-After you.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.424
Riley, we're cartoons.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.658
I know. Isn't it great? Bleh.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.977
Why is this so great? Bleh.

18:49.978 --> 18:52.295
Because now we can
finally see the world
through each other's eyes.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.005
Ugh. Everything's pretty.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.409
(screams)

19:05.411 --> 19:08.946
How do i unsee this?
Switch back! Switch back!

19:10.316 --> 19:11.883
-(sigh)
-(sigh)

19:11.885 --> 19:13.751
I like it better
as a human being.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.454
Me too. I do wanna
do this though.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.890
Bing, bing, bang, bang,
boing, boing, bing,

19:18.892 --> 19:21.192
Okay, i'm over it.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.493
You do realize that
doy didn't do this to us,
don't you?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.997
You're back,
aren't you ghosty?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.470
It's very hard
to leave a place like this.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.039
-We know.
-We keep coming back, too.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.476
I promised myself i wouldn't go
until i found somebody else

19:38.478 --> 19:41.112
Who appreciated this bay window
as much as i did.

19:41.114 --> 19:44.332
You know why?

19:44.333 --> 19:47.551
Because you never wanted this
bay window to become like
that bay window.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.021
I promise you,
it never will be.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.840
I know.

19:51.841 --> 19:53.658
I watched you both
share your dreams in here.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.893
They're good dreams.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.028
I hope they come true.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.730
So, you're
actually leaving us?

19:59.732 --> 20:03.034
I have a friend
who could use some
company in her bay window.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.503
This place is in good hands.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.372
Can we ask you something?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.242
Anything you want.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.111
We sit in this window
because we've always felt
that it had some power.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.948
But will it
after you're gone?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.552
I'm not the magic
of this place anymore.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.653
You are.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.060
(harp plays)

20:33.533 --> 20:34.899
Another day.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.500
Yeah.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.002
Can't wait 'til tomorrow.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.570
Yeah.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.713
All:
(snoring)

21:01.561 --> 21:03.160
Kids.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.595
