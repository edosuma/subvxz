WEBVTT

00:05.689 --> 00:07.160
Green.

00:07.220 --> 00:09.130
That's what I
remember the most:

00:09.190 --> 00:11.660
that shade of green.

00:11.730 --> 00:14.730
It might have been
the most beautiful thing

00:14.800 --> 00:17.970
I had ever seen.

00:18.030 --> 00:20.600
Just the color.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.510
The only time we were inside
was when we slept,

00:22.570 --> 00:25.780
and even then
not half the time.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.650
There was a tire swing.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.580
Every summer,
that thing would break,

00:34.650 --> 00:37.250
and every summer,
Grandpa would fix it.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.000
And the apples--
Oh, man, I'm telling you,

00:50.070 --> 00:51.570
apples ain't the same
anymore.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.040
I mean,
I don't know what they--

00:54.100 --> 00:56.240
Pete, would you shut
the hell up?

00:56.310 --> 00:58.180
Nothing's the same anymore.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.610
Lights out!

01:00.680 --> 01:02.650
Three years in here.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.050
I feel like I've spent
every moment of that

01:06.150 --> 01:07.150
listening to this crap.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.050
Pete had the perfect summers.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.160
Pete had the perfect
grandparents.

01:11.190 --> 01:12.720
All that money
from the bond business,

01:12.790 --> 01:15.160
but they loved you anyways.
They had the time for you,

01:15.190 --> 01:16.790
until Mommy pissed them off
20 years ago.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.160
They did.

01:19.230 --> 01:22.330
It's all true.
And it just pisses you off

01:22.400 --> 01:24.530
because it was better
than your screwed-up life,

01:24.600 --> 01:25.740
whatever that was.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.940
I know your life sucked
worse than mine.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.810
At least
I have people skills.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.880
You're a con man.

01:33.940 --> 01:35.280
Yes, I'm a confidence man.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.180
I give people confidence,
they give me their money.

01:37.250 --> 01:40.180
You, what, you tried to rob
a gun range at gunpoint?

01:40.220 --> 01:42.490
I get out of here in two days.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.450
You're not even up for parole
for another two years,

01:44.520 --> 01:48.230
which means my life is
currently better than yours.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.590
So I either had
a better life than you,

01:49.660 --> 01:52.700
or none of that crap
means nothing.

01:55.570 --> 01:58.340
Either way,
just stop talking about it.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.540
Okay?

02:05.240 --> 02:07.480
24 more hours, Eddie.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.710
Oh, my God. You know
the first thing I'm gonna do?

02:09.780 --> 02:11.820
I'm gonna murder
a cheeseburger at Donovan's.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.420
Yeah, that's a good burger.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.650
All right, little brother,
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.120
Uh...

02:17.220 --> 02:18.220
Everything all right?

02:18.290 --> 02:20.360
No, Marius, it's not.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.790
Uh...you can't come back here.

02:23.860 --> 02:25.300
- What do you mean?
- It's Vince.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.030
We owe him more money
than I thought--

02:27.100 --> 02:28.830
- A lot more.
- How much?

02:30.100 --> 02:31.640
- A hundred grand.
- What?

02:31.700 --> 02:34.340
Wait a minute. That's
what it was to start with.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.910
I've been paying him.
You've been paying him.

02:35.970 --> 02:37.810
- What the fuck happened?
- He says it's interest

02:37.870 --> 02:40.710
that the-- the vig's been
running for three years.

02:40.780 --> 02:44.380
- So now you tell me? I mean--
- I just found out.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.350
He wants me dead, doesn't he?

02:48.420 --> 02:50.550
I don't know. I don't know.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.460
But he's gonna have people
waiting for you

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
when you get out, so--

02:53.590 --> 02:54.890
Well, I got to talk to him.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.690
No. I think this is
beyond talk, Marius,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.100
at least for you.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.530
Look, he likes me, all right?

03:00.600 --> 03:03.100
So just--
Let me try to work him.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.630
But right now you got to hide.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.640
- Ah, Eddie.
- You got to hide.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.310
Yeah. All right. All right.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.790 --> 03:32.330
So what, you're not
talking anymore?

03:33.400 --> 03:34.960
That was your advice.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.030
No, you were right.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.770
My-- My life sucked.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.370
I had a dad I never met

03:42.440 --> 03:44.770
and a mother
who was only around

03:44.840 --> 03:46.310
when she didn't have
a needle in her arm

03:46.340 --> 03:49.480
and about a dozen
foster parents,

03:49.550 --> 03:53.650
only three of whom weren't
there for the crappy check.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.790
And you had...
loving grandparents.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.890
It makes me feel like
something's possible.

04:04.930 --> 04:08.370
If you wanna-- If you
wanna talk about it.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.770
Grandma was always
my favorite.

04:17.370 --> 04:19.440
She didn't take nothing
from nobody.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.740
- No?
- No.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.510
Everyone else
was afraid of her.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.050
Where's the farm?

04:57.210 --> 04:59.880
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.030
Wait. Excuse me.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.900
We're waiting
for a friend of ours.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.830
Marius Josepovich?

05:14.900 --> 05:15.970
He gets out today.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.400
Oh, you're his brothers.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.640
His what? No.

05:22.770 --> 05:25.410
Only one stop.
It's not the blue line.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.080
But my brothers
are coming to meet me.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.890
I'm thrilled for you.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.520
And my dad is with them.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.920
He wasn't supposed to be,
but he wouldn't stay home.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.800
My dad doesn't know
that I was in prison.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.630
He had a heart attack
just before I went away,

05:48.700 --> 05:50.530
and then another one
last month,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.340
and my mother thinks
the truth is gonna kill him.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.540
We managed to keep
the secret for three years.

05:55.610 --> 05:57.310
You want me
to screw that up now?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.180
Come on, just stop the bus
at the next light,

05:59.240 --> 06:00.980
open the lever,
I'll get out,

06:01.040 --> 06:04.950
I'll walk the rest of the way
and give my dad a hug...

06:05.010 --> 06:06.520
like a normal son.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.460
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:24.330 --> 06:25.740
Whew!

06:28.970 --> 06:31.640
Whoo!

06:38.480 --> 06:40.580
A good hockey player
plays where the puck is.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.790
A great hockey player

06:42.850 --> 06:45.350
plays where the puck
is going to be.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.520
Now who said that,
Bobby? Huh? Who?

06:47.590 --> 06:49.560
Nate, I got no idea.

06:49.630 --> 06:50.860
- Hello.
- Pass.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.400
I-- I am a bit lost here.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.000
Hey, you got an accent.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.400
Where are you from?

06:56.500 --> 06:59.100
- Me?
- Yeah.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.200
I am from Montreal,
Canada.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.740
Jesus. I hate Canada.
You know that?

07:06.510 --> 07:07.810
I'm sorry.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.150
Ha ha ha ha! Wait.

07:11.210 --> 07:12.820
Bobby, you hear that?

07:12.880 --> 07:16.090
I insult this guy,
and he apologizes to me!

07:16.150 --> 07:18.120
Canadians. Amazing.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.530
I'm busting your balls,
man!

07:21.530 --> 07:22.960
I love Canada!

07:23.030 --> 07:25.560
I lost my virginity
in a strip club in Montreal.

07:25.630 --> 07:27.830
My pops paid for it.
The man was a saint.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.070
Come here. I'll help you.
This guy knows nothing.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.240
Come over here.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.540
Come on.

07:33.570 --> 07:36.870
Uh, I-- I am, uh,
I am going here.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.240
- Mm-hmm.
- But, uh,

07:38.310 --> 07:39.680
we are-- we are here, yeah?

07:39.740 --> 07:41.440
Oh, you want to go
to Albany?

07:41.550 --> 07:43.380
- Yeah.
- You just take the train.

07:43.450 --> 07:44.550
Walk right outside,
make a left,

07:44.580 --> 07:47.180
go straight.
You can't miss it.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.650
Great. Thank you.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.420
I must be going because, uh...

07:50.550 --> 07:51.920
I heard there was going
to be more snow.

07:51.990 --> 07:55.930
Uh, barkeep, uh, another
drink for my friend, huh?

07:55.990 --> 07:59.200
- Hey.
- And the quote was Gretsky.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.100
You hear that, Bobby?
Gretsky.

09:37.530 --> 09:41.130
Hi, Grandma, Grandpa.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.500
It's me-- Pete.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.670
Oh!

09:52.710 --> 09:53.880
Pete, it's--

10:34.350 --> 10:36.390
Pete?

10:36.450 --> 10:38.320
Would you like
some lemonade?

10:38.390 --> 10:40.460
- Oh, I would--
- He hates lemonade.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.290
Audrey.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.990
I was gonna say

10:44.060 --> 10:46.230
I'd love a glass of water,
if that's all right.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.330
Thank you for bringing
that out, though.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.740
Okay.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.000
Thank you, Grandpa.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.620
Wasn't there an apple tree
out there?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.420
Uh, died
a couple years ago.

11:09.490 --> 11:13.290
Well, where do you build
your treehouses now, Grandpa?

11:13.360 --> 11:16.030
Where have you been
for the last 20 years?

11:16.090 --> 11:18.900
I mean, where have you lived?
Have you been married?

11:18.960 --> 11:20.930
Do you have any kids?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.570
- So much to catch up on.
- How's your mom?

11:23.630 --> 11:27.240
I haven't talked to her
in three years.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.270
- What happened?
- You know how she is

11:29.340 --> 11:31.610
She's just not quick
to forgive a mistake.

11:31.670 --> 11:34.010
That might be hereditary.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.010
What she did to us was
unforgivable.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.790
I called the whole family
over for lunch.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.790
All your cousins.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.360
Great.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.360
Great.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.030
My grandma thinks
your mom's a screw-up.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.170
I'm his grandma too,
and I never said that.

11:56.230 --> 11:59.340
Don't worry.
She says I'm a screw-up too.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.940
I never said that.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.970
Adorable.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.980
Is that a new blouse?

12:09.850 --> 12:12.320
No. It's Laney's.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.420
I just borrowed it last time
that I slept over at her place.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.450
It's pretty.

12:23.390 --> 12:26.830
Julia, you're just
as I remember you.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.700
I had crooked teeth
and braids.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.070
Well, you were beautiful.

12:33.270 --> 12:37.040
- Where are your parents?
- They're dead.

12:37.110 --> 12:39.040
- Carly.
- Is it easier for everyone

12:39.110 --> 12:40.840
if I say they passed?

12:40.840 --> 12:42.480
They passed.

12:42.550 --> 12:46.950
Our parents died in a car
accident 12 years ago.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.850
- Then Grandpa had a stroke.
- I'm fine.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.690
You forget stuff,
Grandpa.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.990
Everyone forgets stuff.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.290
Okay, well, he can't
walk that well,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.590
- so he can't work.
- I can work.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.460
He can't work,
so I have to work.

12:58.530 --> 13:01.630
- I can work.
- You don't have to work.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.170
I was supposed to be
retired 10 years ago.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.670
You could retire tomorrow.

13:04.730 --> 13:07.640
And what,
you're gonna take over?

13:07.700 --> 13:10.540
Julia's been working at the
business for a couple of years.

13:10.610 --> 13:12.410
She's been a big help.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.540
And you did a great job,
actually, running the place

13:15.610 --> 13:17.010
while I was sick
a few weeks ago,

13:17.080 --> 13:19.650
- Am I blushing?
- But we make money

13:19.720 --> 13:22.150
by knowing who we can trust
and who can't trust,

13:22.220 --> 13:25.020
and I'm sorry, but if that
were a strong suit of yours,

13:25.090 --> 13:27.690
your kids would have
the same color eyes.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.090
Really?

13:41.300 --> 13:43.910
Where did you study finance?

13:47.280 --> 13:50.450
Oh, I'm sorry. You work for
the family business, right?

13:50.510 --> 13:52.020
Bonds and mutual funds?

13:52.080 --> 13:55.180
I figured you'd have
a business degree.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.290
- The bond business.
- No?

13:57.350 --> 14:00.990
In your 10-year-old mind,
we're this rich family

14:01.060 --> 14:03.390
in the bond business,
aren't we?

14:03.460 --> 14:05.360
We're in the bail bonds
business.

14:05.430 --> 14:07.430
And we're so not rich.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.200
I can't go on my class
trip this year.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.230
Oh, for God's sakes,
enough about us.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.370
Pete, you never did tell us
what you've been doing.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.270
- What's that?
- How you make your money.

14:15.340 --> 14:19.480
Oh, yeah. Well, a little bit
of this, a little bit of that.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.950
I've been doing some
investigative work
for an insurance company.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.510
Uh, you know,
tracking down valuables,

14:25.580 --> 14:27.850
finding missing persons,

14:27.950 --> 14:31.490
uh, following people
who are faking injuries.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.090
No kidding.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.160
How long you planning
on staying for, Pete?

14:35.220 --> 14:38.430
- Couple days.
- What-- Uh,

14:38.490 --> 14:42.730
We haven't seen you
in 20 years,

14:42.800 --> 14:45.230
and you think you're gonna
disappear again in two days?

14:45.300 --> 14:48.640
Especially when we need you?
Our skip tracer quit.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.740
I know, but my current
employer is expecting me back.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.980
Nonsense. When family asks
for help, you don't say no.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.750
We insist on you staying.

14:56.810 --> 14:58.750
- Grandma.
- Taylor.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.620
Gramps. Pete!

15:04.990 --> 15:07.790
- It's been way too long.
- Okay.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.990
Man, inseparable every summer
until we were 12--

15:11.030 --> 15:12.500
Tell me about it. Wow.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.460
...like we were one person,
and then just nothing.

15:15.530 --> 15:18.770
That's just wrong.
You know what I'm saying?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.540
You remember the crayfish?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.240
Yeah.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.210
I still laugh about that.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.240
- You remember
Shawn's reaction--
- Sure.

15:26.310 --> 15:27.880
- ...when I almost shot one?
- Oh, my gosh.

15:28.010 --> 15:32.020
He would imitate him every time
we saw this kid for years.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.020
Do it. Come on,
just give me a little taste.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.320
- Come on.
- No.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.150
Please?
Just give me a little of it.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.920
Come on, do it.
You must remember it.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.160
Come on, man.

15:49.100 --> 15:53.540
- He cried.
- And-- And--

15:53.600 --> 15:55.400
He cried, and then
we made fun of him.

15:55.470 --> 15:58.040
Because it was, uh,
hysterical.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.440
Look, we were kids.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.210
And I'm sure
that poor old Shawn

16:01.280 --> 16:02.210
has gotten over it by now.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.850
Unit 19.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.210
- Oh!
- Yeah.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.620
Unit 19. What's up?

16:06.680 --> 16:08.680
We got a domestic
on Kenny Road 8.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.090
You anywhere near there?

16:10.150 --> 16:12.120
Yeah, uh--

16:12.190 --> 16:13.320
- Yeah, I can be there in 10.
- 10-4.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.960
I'm sorry, guys.
I gotta fly.

16:16.060 --> 16:18.960
- You're a-- You're a--
- A cop, yeah.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.530
Things have changed, huh?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.530
I had to figure at least
one of us would be on

16:22.600 --> 16:24.330
the other side of the law
by now, right?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.370
Ahh!

16:26.440 --> 16:29.110
That was easy.
I let you off easy.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.070
- See you guys.
- See you.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.710
Wow, that's great.

16:33.780 --> 16:36.080
- He's a cop.
- Yeah.

16:43.890 --> 16:46.190
- Marius, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.290
I, uh-- I don't think
I can stay here, though.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.660
The resource potential
is slimmer than I thought,

16:50.730 --> 16:52.100
and the risks are higher.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.560
All right, but you're safe.

16:54.630 --> 16:56.100
Where are you?

16:57.570 --> 16:59.570
Maybe I should
just talk to Vince.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.270
Yeah. You know, that--
You're good at that.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.610
Calming people down,
right?

17:02.670 --> 17:04.210
Making them want
to give you stuff.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.410
Just tell me where you are.
I'll come get you.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.240
Wait a minute.
Yesterday, you said

17:08.310 --> 17:09.810
I wasn't gonna get out
of this by talking.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.510
It was your idea.

17:11.579 --> 17:14.119
Yesterday,
I thought you had options.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.819
Today,
you tell me you don't.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.020
That's true.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.790
So where are you?

17:22.560 --> 17:25.160
I'm in the city. Hey,
I'll text you the address.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.130
- See you tomorrow morning.
- All right.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.310
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.410
Shit. You scared
the shit out of me.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.650
Sorry. I didn't see you
sitting there.

17:50.350 --> 17:52.160
What are you listening to?

17:56.630 --> 17:58.790
What are you--
What are you listening to?

17:58.860 --> 18:01.530
Uh, Norwegian death metal.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.400
Blocks out the sound of
Grandma and Julia arguing.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.000
Yeah.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.410
Yeah, that's rough.

18:09.470 --> 18:12.640
I know what it's like to be
around people fighting.

18:12.710 --> 18:16.780
Sometimes you just have to
get some space, you know?

18:23.690 --> 18:24.690
Okay.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.190
So,

18:26.220 --> 18:27.690
just so I'm clear,

18:27.760 --> 18:30.460
this is the part
where we bond, right?

18:31.530 --> 18:32.600
What's that?

18:32.660 --> 18:33.600
You know,

18:33.660 --> 18:35.300
where you
give me some bullshit

18:35.360 --> 18:36.870
about understanding
what I'm going through

18:36.930 --> 18:38.900
and then suddenly
we're besties?

18:38.970 --> 18:40.440
Wow.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.210
Yeah, I don't--

18:43.210 --> 18:45.270
I don't know where this
is coming from.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.510
And frankly I'm--
I'm a little surprised

18:47.580 --> 18:50.810
because I-- because I
covered for you back there.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.480
Covered for me how?

18:52.550 --> 18:56.520
Oh, really? We're going
to play that game?

18:56.590 --> 18:59.490
Come on.
You stole that blouse.

19:01.520 --> 19:06.630
Right. So you think
that I stole a blouse,

19:06.700 --> 19:09.230
and now
we're thick as thieves

19:09.270 --> 19:12.500
because you didn't
rat me out.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.300
- Who's the thief?
- Okay, the fact is

19:14.370 --> 19:16.240
I just forgot to take
the sticker off.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.310
Oh. That's right.

19:17.370 --> 19:18.540
That's why
you ripped it off

19:18.610 --> 19:20.140
before anybody else
could see.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.440
My mistake. Sorry. Right.

19:21.510 --> 19:22.850
You didn't steal the blouse.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.350
By the way, you're welcome.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.260
Oh, Eddie, you son of a bitch.

19:40.330 --> 19:42.300
Go. Just drive.

19:50.870 --> 19:52.040
Okay. Don't smile.

19:52.110 --> 19:54.340
You can't smile
for passport pictures.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.620
All right. Come back
in 50 minutes.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.480
- Thank you.
- Cash only.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.160
Hi, Joseph.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.260
Marius.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.860
Didn't know you got out.

20:14.530 --> 20:15.530
Just.

20:17.070 --> 20:18.100
You look good.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.440
Can't complain.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.570
Nobody will listen anyway.

20:24.910 --> 20:28.810
I assume this isn't
just a, uh, social call.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.480
No. I need a setup.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.220
You aged.

20:36.290 --> 20:37.890
Prison years
are like dog years.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.490
Well, at least you're
still alive.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.790
- Joseph--
- Hey, look,

20:41.860 --> 20:43.960
I don't blame you, okay?
About Charlie.

20:44.030 --> 20:47.360
Sometimes these things,
they just go south, right?

20:47.430 --> 20:50.600
It's the life we choose.
The life you chose.

20:50.670 --> 20:52.130
Chin up.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.840
Have you heard
from Porter?

20:55.670 --> 20:59.710
Last time we spoke,
he... he sounded old.

21:01.580 --> 21:02.710
Uh, what are
the particulars?

21:02.780 --> 21:04.810
I just need
a driver's license

21:04.880 --> 21:07.250
with a hologram,
the whole 9 yards.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.580
Needs to be foolproof.

21:08.650 --> 21:09.990
The only way I do it.

21:10.050 --> 21:11.590
When do you need it by?

21:11.650 --> 21:12.790
Now.

21:12.860 --> 21:13.860
State?

21:15.820 --> 21:18.030
Uh... Washington.

21:18.090 --> 21:20.460
Here. I have
the, uh, details.

21:21.630 --> 21:23.830
You-- You don't have
a burner, do you?

21:23.900 --> 21:24.970
No.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.370
But I got
something better:

21:28.370 --> 21:30.210
an INS eye catcher.

21:30.270 --> 21:31.470
Creates
random misdirects

21:31.540 --> 21:32.810
between your phone
and the cell towers.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.440
Makes your location
completely untraceable.

21:38.110 --> 21:39.050
I don't have any money.

21:39.110 --> 21:40.780
Don't worry about it.

21:40.850 --> 21:43.990
But that--
that makes us even.

21:44.050 --> 21:45.090
Right?

21:45.150 --> 21:47.390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.390
Yeah.

21:48.420 --> 21:49.860
All right.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.700
Peter Murphy, come back
and see me in an hour.

22:07.180 --> 22:08.910
You're not very good
at that.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.680
I never liked you anyway.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.920
You want a place
to stay?

22:19.990 --> 22:21.190
Not in the city.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.730
Vince's goons
are looking for me.

22:24.990 --> 22:27.630
You know, Eddie just
tried to deliver me up.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.100
Look, Eddie's just
trying to stay alive.

22:31.170 --> 22:32.740
He's not the only one.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.770
I don't blame him.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.210
Vince thinks I still
owe him a hundred grand.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.580
Well, it's unfortunate,

22:40.640 --> 22:42.850
but it doesn't really
change things, does it?

22:44.050 --> 22:45.910
No, no, it doesn't, no.

22:48.220 --> 22:49.790
You still want to do this?

22:49.850 --> 22:51.490
Do you?

22:51.550 --> 22:54.620
If you can't get justice,
you get revenge.

22:55.860 --> 22:56.660
Besides,

22:56.730 --> 22:58.360
how many times in this life

22:58.460 --> 22:59.530
does one get
the opportunity

22:59.600 --> 23:01.030
to pull off the Turk?

23:06.470 --> 23:08.500
It's his last bottle.

23:08.570 --> 23:11.140
I've been saving it.

23:13.540 --> 23:15.380
I don't know how he'd
feel about paper cups,

23:15.480 --> 23:16.910
but...

23:16.980 --> 23:18.980
He'd have drunk Pappy
from the sponge

23:19.050 --> 23:20.480
if he could have.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.500
Ohh.

23:39.570 --> 23:41.570
We'll save the rest
for the end.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.200
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

24:15.270 --> 24:16.670
hallowed be Thy name.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.440
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

24:20.540 --> 24:22.550
on earth as it is in heaven.

24:22.610 --> 24:24.780
Give us this day
our daily bread,

24:24.850 --> 24:27.080
and lead us not
into temptation...

24:27.150 --> 24:28.550
You were right.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.720
When family asks for help,
you don't say no.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.190
I'll take the job.

24:34.260 --> 24:35.860
...for ever and ever.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.130
Amen.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.830
Hey. Anything happening
this morning?

24:43.900 --> 24:46.570
- We got a skip.
- Damn. Who?

24:46.640 --> 24:49.200
Brad Lewis.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.670
The B&E? No kidding.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.180
Figured for sure

24:53.240 --> 24:55.240
that kid didn't have
the balls to try running.

24:55.310 --> 24:58.150
Take Pete.

24:58.210 --> 25:01.750
Brad's an idiot and a coward.
I don't think I need backup.

25:01.820 --> 25:03.350
Perfect. It'll give
Pete a chance

25:03.420 --> 25:04.950
to learn on an easy case.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.090
Take him.

25:16.460 --> 25:20.440
This file says Abraham
Persikoff, not Brad Lewis.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.300
I must have misspoken.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.170
- What?
- We put up a $20,000 bond

25:26.240 --> 25:27.680
for Abraham Persikoff.

25:27.740 --> 25:30.250
This morning he had
a pre-trial hearing.

25:30.310 --> 25:32.950
He didn't show. If he doesn't
show up for pre-trial,

25:33.020 --> 25:34.680
he is not gonna show up
for trial,

25:34.750 --> 25:36.250
And if he doesn't
show up for trial,

25:36.320 --> 25:37.650
we don't get paid.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.390
So where are we going?

25:45.460 --> 25:46.800
We're starting
at his mom's house.

25:46.860 --> 25:49.100
Skips always run
to where they feel safe.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.400
"Check databases,
voter registration.

25:51.470 --> 25:53.070
"and last known addresses.

25:53.140 --> 25:55.040
Skips always run
to where they feel safe."

25:55.100 --> 25:56.640
You just said that.
Wait a minute.

25:56.670 --> 25:58.440
So we're literally
doing this by the book?

25:58.510 --> 26:00.810
Everybody loves their mom.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.130
Wrong driveway.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.700
Yeah. I'm gonna
go to the address

26:21.760 --> 26:23.670
of somebody who wouldn't
lie, cheat, or steal

26:23.670 --> 26:27.370
to protect the person
that we're trying to put
in jail, all right?

26:27.440 --> 26:29.840
No, this is a good plan.
You go there, I'll go here.

26:29.910 --> 26:31.940
We'll work together separately.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.280
If you're covering for him,
you're not helping him.

26:38.350 --> 26:39.820
If he's called you--

26:39.880 --> 26:42.820
If he had called,
I would tell you.

26:42.890 --> 26:44.790
I'm worried something terrible
has happened to him.

26:44.850 --> 26:49.060
Okay. Here.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.830
Thank you.

26:52.230 --> 26:55.100
Does Abraham have a girlfriend
that he might turn to?

26:55.160 --> 26:57.770
I don't think there's
anyone serious right now.

26:57.830 --> 27:00.200
And has he ever done
any home renovations

27:00.270 --> 27:02.200
or major remodeling?

27:02.270 --> 27:05.170
I'm sorry, I don't understand
why that would matter.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.540
I want to know where
he would go when he needs--

27:08.610 --> 27:11.910
Reason I ask is because--

27:11.980 --> 27:14.720
When he needed
a place to crash,

27:14.750 --> 27:16.120
where did he stay?

27:16.180 --> 27:18.750
Oh, well, about five years ago,
his roof collapsed.

27:18.820 --> 27:22.420
It was such a mess.
So many things ruined,
so many memories.

27:22.490 --> 27:24.490
And who did he stay with?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.630
Oh, his friend Stuart.

27:26.730 --> 27:30.300
Do you have a last name?
Address? Phone number?

27:30.370 --> 27:31.970
Ah, he's in construction.

27:32.030 --> 27:34.540
What if he's hurt?

27:35.940 --> 27:37.510
What if he was
in an accident?

27:37.570 --> 27:40.110
Oh, no, I already checked
the hospitals and the morgue.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.240
You have?

27:47.280 --> 27:49.180
You can't break
into houses, okay?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.820
You get caught,
we lose our license.

27:50.890 --> 27:53.490
- She's lying.
- How do you know that?

27:53.560 --> 27:55.290
Because the neighbor
saw Abraham here

27:55.360 --> 27:57.560
four times in the last three
days, twice overnight.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.760
- That bitch.
- Yeah.

27:59.830 --> 28:01.500
Yeah, she's a bitch.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.470
- No.
- What are you doing?

28:03.530 --> 28:06.300
No. When a liar
gets caught in a lie,
they don't come clean.

28:06.370 --> 28:07.770
They build a bigger lie.

28:07.770 --> 28:11.040
So we wait for him
to come back.

28:11.110 --> 28:13.440
No. I guarantee you
the first thing she did

28:13.510 --> 28:15.640
after you walked out was
call him and warn him.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.580
Besides,
I know where he's going.

28:17.650 --> 28:19.850
- You stole his computer.
- Okay. You know what?

28:19.920 --> 28:22.380
- If we catch him,
you can give it back.
- Oh, my God.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.450
And if not, he owes you
at least that much, right?

28:24.520 --> 28:26.490
Anyways,
I know where he's going.

28:26.550 --> 28:28.160
He's going to get his fix.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.430
I'm still not sure
I'm buying this.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.070
If he's on the run,
he should be staying low.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.700
A gambler on the run
is still a gambler.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.370
We are who we are.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.810
So you're still the same jerk
you were when you were 10?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.570
I worshipped you,

28:45.640 --> 28:46.910
and you weren't very nice
to me.

28:46.980 --> 28:48.280
Well, I was a different
person back then.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.510
I mean,
I was 10 years old, right?

28:50.580 --> 28:53.880
So I guess that means I
kind of won that argument.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.150
He's here.

28:58.220 --> 28:59.450
Leather jacket.

29:03.230 --> 29:05.330
That's Abraham Persikoff?
Where's the file?

29:05.390 --> 29:07.830
The file you didn't
bother to look at?

29:09.700 --> 29:11.700
- You know him?
- Uh, no.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.040
You're acting
like you know him.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.570
- You're acting scared.
- He's a felon.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.910
He's not violent. He's facing
tax evasion charges.

29:19.070 --> 29:20.210
What if he's not?

29:20.280 --> 29:23.210
If you actually know
something, say it.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.950
I know that before
we do anything,

29:25.010 --> 29:27.050
we should probably know
who we're dealing with.

29:28.980 --> 29:30.490
Okay, here's the plan.

29:30.550 --> 29:31.890
And they're off.

29:31.950 --> 29:33.590
Monogram on the inside
with a quick start.

29:33.660 --> 29:35.690
Willie Boy in the pocket,
followed by Almost Heaven,

29:35.760 --> 29:37.060
Time to Go, and Red Tail.

29:37.130 --> 29:39.930
Abraham, you need
to come with me

29:41.260 --> 29:42.200
Seriously?

29:42.260 --> 29:44.230
Please don't
make this difficult.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.990
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

30:09.060 --> 30:12.060
Oh, my God.
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.530
I--
I heard footsteps, and--

30:13.600 --> 30:16.300
I don't know how you were
the first footsteps.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.870
No, he came--
he came through here.

30:18.930 --> 30:21.000
I-- No, he must have--
he must have turned

30:21.070 --> 30:23.040
down the hallway
or something, I don't know,

30:23.110 --> 30:24.940
and he ducked into a room.
No.

30:26.010 --> 30:28.080
You let him get away.

30:28.140 --> 30:31.110
Y-You must have
let him get away.

30:32.050 --> 30:34.280
Why would you
let him get away?

30:38.690 --> 30:40.160
Because I--

30:41.520 --> 30:42.860
I know him.

30:42.930 --> 30:45.090
What?

30:47.660 --> 30:50.370
That guy
would have killed us.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.670
Abraham Persikoff
is not a tax cheat.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.240
Well, he might be,
but who cares?

31:00.310 --> 31:02.110
He's also Max Peron,
and under that name

31:02.180 --> 31:03.780
he runs a construction
and protection racket

31:03.850 --> 31:04.950
in Long Island,

31:05.010 --> 31:06.110
and he's probably killed

31:06.180 --> 31:07.380
half a dozen people.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.380
How do you know him?

31:08.450 --> 31:09.620
I----

31:09.680 --> 31:11.320
I just know
people he knows.

31:11.390 --> 31:13.290
You haven't seen me
in 20 years.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.820
I've had a life.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.320
You're fired.

31:16.390 --> 31:18.130
Julia-- Julia, whatever
you posted for him,

31:18.190 --> 31:19.490
you should just write it off.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.100
I don't care if it's
a million dollars.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.700
It's not worth dying over.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.100
He walks,
I miss the next payment

31:24.170 --> 31:25.330
on our line of credit.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.070
The bank
starts seizing assets.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.970
Our grandparents
lose the business,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.240
maybe the farm.

31:30.310 --> 31:31.870
Our grandparents
started this business.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.510
My parents met
in this business.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.980
And that car accident--
they were working a case.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.450
This business
is this family,

31:38.510 --> 31:39.510
and it will not end

31:39.580 --> 31:42.080
because I trusted
the wrong guy yet again.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.220
So yeah, I am finding him,

31:44.290 --> 31:46.290
and I am taking him in.

31:46.350 --> 31:49.660
You need me. I know this guy.
I know this world.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.630
You need somebody to tell you
that that was a lousy plan.

31:51.690 --> 31:55.000
It was a good plan
right up to the point
where you screwed it up.

31:55.030 --> 31:56.330
Plans that involve
running after people

31:56.400 --> 31:58.070
and tackling people
are never good plans.

31:58.130 --> 31:59.800
Are you afraid of
getting into a fight?

31:59.870 --> 32:01.040
Yeah, I am. I like my face.

32:01.100 --> 32:04.310
Have you ever been punched?
It hurts.

32:04.370 --> 32:06.010
Look, there's always
a better way.

32:06.070 --> 32:07.910
There's always a smarter way,
and if there isn't,

32:08.010 --> 32:10.310
running away is
a perfectly sensible idea.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.760
Can we get out of here?

32:20.820 --> 32:23.030
Taylor can call us
with the info.

32:23.060 --> 32:25.790
I shouldn't even be looking
at people's credit card
records without a warrant.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.030
You tell me that
every time, and every time,
you get me the info.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.330
And every time, it's worth
reminding you that I don't
like doing this.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.830
Taylor, if it makes you
feel uncomfortable,

32:32.900 --> 32:34.740
you can just issue
an APB on the guy.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.300
We can get out of your hair.

32:36.370 --> 32:39.110
Federal charges.
We don't have jurisdiction.

32:39.170 --> 32:43.250
Okay. Abraham Persikoff
has three cards.

32:43.310 --> 32:45.180
Flights, trains, buses?

32:45.250 --> 32:46.850
He's got to be trying to get
as far away from here

32:46.910 --> 32:48.550
as fast as possible.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.550
No. A couple of cabs,
a couple of lunches.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.290
What about Max Peron?
You can check his cards.

32:54.190 --> 32:59.660
- Ah.
- Scroll.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.730
Okay, he's got a hotel
in New York

33:01.800 --> 33:02.930
a couple of weeks ago,

33:03.070 --> 33:04.100
a charity donation,

33:04.170 --> 33:05.300
and a couple of cabs
again.

33:05.370 --> 33:06.700
No flights, no trains.

33:06.770 --> 33:07.740
- Hey.
- Huh?

33:07.800 --> 33:09.740
- I know you.
- What?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.070
Where do I know you from?

33:14.740 --> 33:16.680
Uh-- You're mistaken.

33:16.740 --> 33:17.680
I don't think so.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.980
No.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.220
Wait a minute.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.190
You're my kid's
soccer coach, right?

33:28.320 --> 33:31.090
No. I get mistaken
for people a lot.

33:31.130 --> 33:32.560
I think I just have
a common face.

33:32.630 --> 33:34.400
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.930
Oh, God. New charge
just came through

33:37.000 --> 33:38.230
On one of Persikoff's
cards.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.200
Two hours ago,
he bought a flight

33:40.270 --> 33:42.140
out of Hartford
to Buffalo.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.810
Border town.

33:43.870 --> 33:45.310
When does it leave?

33:45.370 --> 33:46.640
Less than an hour.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.210
All right.

33:50.180 --> 33:52.250
- Thanks, Taylor.
- Yeah.

33:58.490 --> 33:59.690
This is perfect--

33:59.750 --> 34:01.960
I mean, not your driving
but the airport.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.360
It's a controlled
environment.

34:03.430 --> 34:04.830
It means he's already been
checked for a weapon.

34:04.890 --> 34:06.260
Yeah. Perfect.

34:06.330 --> 34:08.699
That plane leaves,
our business goes with it.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.530
I'm afraid
the flight to Buffalo
was all sold out.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.199
Okay. Uh...

34:14.270 --> 34:16.670
two tickets for the 5:20
to Fort Lauderdale.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.710
You want to go to Buffalo
or Fort Lauderdale?

34:18.770 --> 34:21.840
Do we only get to go
if we have good reasons
for wanting to go?

34:30.820 --> 34:32.250
Hey, Grandma.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.489
Julia, you'll never guess
who Grandpa just ran into.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.620
Brad Lewis.

34:36.690 --> 34:38.929
Well, found, really,

34:38.989 --> 34:40.199
but it wasn't that tough,

34:40.260 --> 34:42.330
since Brad had no idea

34:42.400 --> 34:43.929
we were even looking for him.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.429
Oh, yeah. It was
a miscommunication

34:45.500 --> 34:47.370
from the court house.
I should have let you know.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.239
Are you okay?
You sound out of breath.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.570
Oh, I'm just playing
tag with Allen.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.770
Oops. He almost got me.
Got to go.

34:57.650 --> 35:00.220
Ma'am, ma'am, so sorry.
We need to get on that flight.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.480
Can I see your boarding passes?

35:01.550 --> 35:02.750
We don't
have the right ones,

35:02.820 --> 35:04.420
but our great-uncle
is on the flight.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.650
He's diabetic. He forgot
his insulin today,

35:06.720 --> 35:09.990
and if we don't get on
that flight, he may die.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.490
Oh, my goodness. Of course.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.460
I'll get one of our flight
attendants to escort you on.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.300
I just need to take care
of some housekeeping first.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.570
Okay, so you have
the insulin, right?

35:17.630 --> 35:19.200
You can go
on the flight alone?

35:19.200 --> 35:21.200
This is a last boarding call

35:21.200 --> 35:23.410
for Flight 1722
to Buffalo, New York.

35:23.470 --> 35:26.070
Abraham Persikoff,
if you are in the terminal,

35:26.210 --> 35:28.480
please report to Gate A8.

35:28.540 --> 35:29.880
You are about
to miss your flight.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.810
Ah. Sir,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.580
the flight attendant will
escort you onto the jet.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.250
- Sir?
- What?

35:37.320 --> 35:40.260
No. Uh, no.
No, it's okay.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.390
- But your uncle.
- It's okay.

35:43.690 --> 35:46.330
You've got apple juice.
He'll be fine.

35:47.230 --> 35:48.460
Maybe he saw me.

35:48.530 --> 35:50.100
He must have seen
one of us.

35:50.230 --> 35:51.470
Let's just hope it was you.

35:51.530 --> 35:54.340
No, I'm sorry. He just
knows people that I know

35:54.400 --> 35:57.240
that-- people who don't
like me very much.

35:57.270 --> 35:59.010
I just can't
have him see me.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.840
People from your
insurance business?

36:00.910 --> 36:02.840
Sounds a lot more dramatic
than I thought it was.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.250
What's up, Taylor?

36:04.310 --> 36:06.050
Just heard from my guy
at the credit bureau.

36:06.110 --> 36:09.250
Persikoff used the same card
to buy another plane ticket,

36:09.320 --> 36:10.550
this one to Detroit,

36:10.620 --> 36:12.090
leaving in two hours
out of Providence.

36:12.150 --> 36:14.290
Thanks, Taylor. Come on.
We might make it.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.760
- Wait a minute.
- No, no, no, no.

36:15.820 --> 36:17.460
He's not here. This was
just a distraction.

36:17.530 --> 36:19.290
Are you just
chickening out again?

36:19.360 --> 36:20.700
What's the advantage
that we have over him?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.530
What's the one thing
we know about him

36:22.600 --> 36:24.030
that he doesn't know
we know about him?

36:24.100 --> 36:25.600
That he has
a second identity.

36:25.670 --> 36:28.140
Exactly. Max Peron,
and Max Peron has
credit cards, right?

36:28.270 --> 36:30.140
So why would he book
a plane flight

36:30.270 --> 36:31.540
with Persikoff's
credit cards

36:31.610 --> 36:34.510
unless he wanted us
to know about it, right?

36:34.580 --> 36:37.950
So maybe Persikoff isn't
trying to distract us

36:38.010 --> 36:40.150
while he heads to Providence
or anywhere else.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.420
Maybe he's
trying to distract us

36:41.480 --> 36:43.050
while he stays
right here in town?

36:43.120 --> 36:44.320
Doing what, though?

36:44.390 --> 36:46.290
What do we know?

36:46.290 --> 36:49.290
And what are we not
supposed to know?

36:49.290 --> 36:51.530
The charitable donation?

36:51.590 --> 36:52.730
What?

36:52.790 --> 36:54.300
From--

36:54.300 --> 36:55.900
From Peron's
credit card receipts.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.130
It's odd.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.430
The guy's
giving money away

36:58.500 --> 37:00.540
two weeks before he plans
on skipping bail?

37:00.600 --> 37:03.440
The Hartford County
Nursing Association.
$500.

37:03.510 --> 37:05.470
- County--
- What? I don't--

37:05.540 --> 37:08.340
That association is
having an event tonight.

37:08.410 --> 37:09.940
Yeah, there's no way
he's going to that.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.110
It would be stupid.
It's too public.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.880
No. He'll be there.

37:13.950 --> 37:16.880
His escape from justice
must wait till tomorrow.

37:16.950 --> 37:19.920
Tonight the Hartford County
Nursing Association

37:19.990 --> 37:22.790
is honoring his mommy.

37:24.890 --> 37:27.330
So we need to be in control
of the situation,

37:27.330 --> 37:29.000
which means we need
to control him.

37:29.060 --> 37:30.900
We need to know
what he's going to do

37:30.970 --> 37:32.930
before he knows
he's going to do it.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.800
Why do you have so many suits?
What are you, a cross-dresser?

37:35.870 --> 37:38.370
Jacob's dad was in such
a hurry to get out of here,

37:38.440 --> 37:40.340
he didn't bother to pack.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.480
Can you help me with this?

37:44.650 --> 37:47.920
We need to separate him
from everyone,

37:47.980 --> 37:50.950
which means we need
to give him a reason

37:51.020 --> 37:52.690
to get away from everyone.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.190
How do we do that
when he knows me,

37:54.260 --> 37:55.520
his mother knows me,

37:55.590 --> 37:57.060
and he's not allowed
to see you?

38:07.200 --> 38:09.040
Evening.
Welcome to Haven Lake.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.370
Are you guys here
for the event?

38:10.410 --> 38:12.010
Great. Can I get
your names, please?

38:12.070 --> 38:13.380
Uh, Stephen Davidson.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.940
Stephen Davidson.
And your guest's name?

38:16.010 --> 38:17.280
This is my wife Dorothy.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.710
Well, you both look
great this evening.

38:18.780 --> 38:19.850
For your safety,

38:19.910 --> 38:21.620
we're having everybody
stay in their cars

38:21.680 --> 38:23.250
until the valets
clear the vehicles
in front of them. Okay?

38:23.390 --> 38:24.990
Nice SL, by the way.

38:26.250 --> 38:27.760
Yes, sir. Step inside.

38:32.390 --> 38:33.600
Tickets, please.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.460
Dorothy, you
have the tickets.

38:37.630 --> 38:41.570
I don't have them, honey.

38:46.310 --> 38:48.180
Remember when you
put on your jacket?

38:48.240 --> 38:49.640
Honey,
you put them in there.

38:49.710 --> 38:51.010
Can you just
check your purse?

38:51.080 --> 38:52.680
I don't much like
your tone,

38:52.750 --> 38:55.320
and I'm sure you had them.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.620
Okay, can you check
the invitation list?

38:57.690 --> 38:59.790
The name's Davidson,
Stephen Davidson.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.160
It's the CF function
all over again.

39:10.230 --> 39:11.430
We're going to waste
another night--

39:11.430 --> 39:12.430
Okay,
that wasn't my fault.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.900
The tickets
were electronic.

39:13.970 --> 39:14.970
And your phone was dead.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.740
Because you let Rory
play Mine Grabber on it.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.310
Great.
It's the 8-year-old's fault.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.440
I knew it couldn't
possibly be yours.

39:20.510 --> 39:21.780
You know how much
I spent on my hair.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.510
You mean how much
I spent on your hair.

39:23.580 --> 39:25.050
Oh, now we get
to the real issue!

39:25.110 --> 39:26.680
It's okay.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.220
Uh, I've got you listed.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.350
Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.

39:31.450 --> 39:32.650
Uh, let's just do this.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.460
I'll scan the main barcode

39:34.490 --> 39:35.860
and let you in.

39:35.920 --> 39:36.890
Oh, thank you.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.090
Thank you.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.460
Such a beautiful night.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.530
No problem.

39:47.270 --> 39:49.140
- Bunny, hi.
- Hi.

39:55.610 --> 39:56.710
You think he's armed?

39:56.780 --> 39:59.510
Well, he'd be
an idiot not to be,

39:59.580 --> 40:01.480
and he's definitely
not an idiot.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.620
Phase 2.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.460
Want something--
Want something to drink?

40:08.520 --> 40:10.290
Yes, I'd love
a little Scotch.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.530
Thank you.

40:13.830 --> 40:16.300
Mrs. Persikoff.
So happy to finally meet you.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.430
I believe you've spoken
to some of my co-workers,

40:18.500 --> 40:20.400
and they all
sing your praises.

40:20.470 --> 40:21.970
- Oh.
- I'm sorry. I'm Martin Unger.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.400
I'm sure somebody
mentioned my name.

40:23.470 --> 40:24.940
I'm in charge of PR
for this event.

40:25.010 --> 40:26.340
It's a lovely event,
lovely people.

40:26.410 --> 40:27.710
Listen, the doctors
get all the credit,

40:27.780 --> 40:29.380
but we know who the real
heroes are, don't we?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.010
You're too kind.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.880
We have a lovely
green room for you upstairs

40:32.950 --> 40:35.120
so you can relax and get some
quiet before your big moment.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.620
I'm fine here.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.090
Okay, yeah. I'll tell Marlene.

40:39.150 --> 40:41.690
You know, she recently
photographed Madonna,

40:41.760 --> 40:43.730
and the pictures were,
dare I say, sumptuous,

40:43.790 --> 40:45.230
and you do look sumptuous,

40:45.290 --> 40:47.500
but do what you want to do.

40:49.260 --> 40:50.530
Well...

40:50.600 --> 40:53.170
I don't want to mess up
any plans.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.400
As soon as my son
comes with the drinks--

40:56.470 --> 40:57.610
No, don't worry about that.

40:57.670 --> 40:58.910
Andy, can you tell
Mr. Persikoff

40:58.970 --> 41:00.310
that his mother
is in the green room?

41:00.370 --> 41:02.180
- Oh, my name's--
- Not now,

41:02.240 --> 41:03.550
Andy.

41:03.610 --> 41:05.110
We have a green room?

41:05.180 --> 41:06.580
Your son must be so proud.

41:06.650 --> 41:08.350
This is like winning
an Oscar for nursing.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.550
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

41:09.580 --> 41:11.550
Well, let me say it
for you, then.

41:15.190 --> 41:17.190
I will be right back.

41:24.770 --> 41:26.300
Hey, Mom.

41:26.370 --> 41:27.300
Mr. Persikoff?

41:27.370 --> 41:28.600
Who is this?

41:28.670 --> 41:30.070
What are you doing
with my mother's phone?

41:30.140 --> 41:31.670
I think she's having
a heart attack.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.610
I don't know.
She's kind of blue.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.880
There's a doctor
here with her.
Where are you?

41:35.940 --> 41:38.250
She wasn't talking.
She was clutching her chest.

41:38.310 --> 41:39.410
They called an ambulance.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.580
I said where are you?

41:41.580 --> 41:43.180
The Hogan Room, second floor.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.730
Abraham Persikoff,

41:56.800 --> 41:58.630
pursuant to the laws
of this state

41:58.700 --> 42:00.970
and Paragraph 6B of
your bail bonds agreement,

42:01.040 --> 42:03.610
I am hereby forcibly
detaining you.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.710
Please, raise your hands.

42:14.050 --> 42:16.120
Have you ever
shot a person before?

42:16.180 --> 42:17.220
Yeah.

42:22.460 --> 42:23.990
I said put your hands up.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.760
The first one's
always the toughest.

42:26.830 --> 42:28.330
Most people
don't have it in them.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.630
Mr. Persikoff--

42:29.660 --> 42:30.930
There's something

42:31.000 --> 42:32.970
that stops us from
pulling that trigger,

42:33.030 --> 42:35.640
even when we have
every reason.

42:35.670 --> 42:37.300
It's a person
in front of us,

42:37.370 --> 42:38.740
- a human being.
- Shut up.

42:38.810 --> 42:40.640
And if you're
the type of person

42:40.710 --> 42:42.080
who could pull
that trigger,

42:42.140 --> 42:44.650
you'll also be
the type of person

42:44.680 --> 42:46.850
who could listen
to what I'm saying

42:46.910 --> 42:49.550
without freaking out.

42:49.650 --> 42:53.790
Put your hands back up.

42:53.860 --> 42:54.990
No.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.860
Mm?

42:57.930 --> 42:59.530
I wonder what's taking
Abraham so long.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.800
You know,
I'm going to call him.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.100
No, no,
that's not necessary.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.670
I'm sure he's just
caught up chatting--

43:03.730 --> 43:04.670
Oh.

43:04.730 --> 43:06.200
- Oh.
- Oh.

43:06.270 --> 43:08.100
Listen to that. Yeah.

43:08.170 --> 43:12.140
Julia, are we all set
for our big honoree?

43:12.210 --> 43:15.840
I have my own gun
pointed at my head.

43:16.710 --> 43:18.050
She found your son.

43:18.110 --> 43:19.710
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

43:19.780 --> 43:22.580
I need you to bring
his mother to the kitchen,

43:22.680 --> 43:24.890
or I die.

43:34.460 --> 43:38.400
This can't be about
tax evasion, huh, Max?

43:40.170 --> 43:41.000
Nothing?

43:41.070 --> 43:43.710
Not even about "Who's Max?"

43:43.770 --> 43:46.040
Or maybe
a "How did you know"--

43:46.110 --> 43:49.780
I knew a guy like you
who wouldn't stop talking,

43:49.840 --> 43:51.910
and the only way I could
get him to shut up

43:51.980 --> 43:53.510
was by sticking the gun
in his mouth

43:53.580 --> 43:54.920
and pulling the trigger.

43:54.980 --> 43:58.050
Made his tongue come out
the back of his neck.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.990
Now,
that is something to see.

44:08.260 --> 44:09.630
Oh. You know what?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.100
I forgot something
in the ballroom.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.730
I'll be right back,
okay?

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
Mom.

44:17.740 --> 44:19.970
What the hell
is she doing here?

44:20.040 --> 44:21.780
- What's going on?
- Who were you with?

44:21.840 --> 44:23.780
- A nice young man.
- Okay, where is he?

44:23.850 --> 44:25.280
He's not coming back.

44:25.350 --> 44:26.950
He's a coward.

44:27.010 --> 44:29.650
Smart guy. Mom,
we're going out the back.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.990
My award. You promised.

44:32.050 --> 44:34.120
I know. I'm sorry, okay?

44:34.190 --> 44:36.860
But the jam I'm in, I got
to do like Uncle Ralphie.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.760
You got to disappear?

44:38.760 --> 44:40.160
I was gonna wait
till you got your award--

44:40.230 --> 44:41.960
- Did you kill a man?
- Ma.

44:42.030 --> 44:43.330
That's what
Uncle Ralphie did.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.770
They're
looking for you?

44:44.770 --> 44:46.970
- In New York.
- Oh, Abe.

44:47.030 --> 44:48.470
What are you going
to do with her?

44:48.540 --> 44:49.770
I haven't decided.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.170
If you're already on
the hook for murder,

44:51.240 --> 44:52.570
- you might as well pop her.
- Ma!

44:52.640 --> 44:53.570
I don't mean here.

44:53.640 --> 44:54.610
In the woods somewhere.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.780
She's not gonna go with me

44:55.840 --> 44:57.010
if she thinks
I'm gonna whack her.

44:57.080 --> 44:58.310
Ralphie said
they always do,

44:58.380 --> 44:59.950
hoping for a miracle.

45:05.690 --> 45:08.120
- Uhh!
- Aah!

45:11.290 --> 45:13.330
Oh! Ohh!

45:18.900 --> 45:21.000
Hey!

45:21.070 --> 45:23.170
You don't think
I'll shoot this time?

45:34.920 --> 45:36.450
I'm going to remember
your face.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.390
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.930
I can't believe
he didn't recognize me.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.100
You are one
very lucky bastard.

45:54.170 --> 45:56.940
Okay, I would have used
the word "heroic" personally.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.040
Hey, uh, don't say anything

45:59.110 --> 46:01.380
about Persikoff being wanted
for murder in New York.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.080
- Are you sure about that?
- I just need a breath

46:03.140 --> 46:04.280
to figure out how I'm
gonna tell Arthur--

46:04.350 --> 46:05.650
No, I might want
to say something--

46:05.710 --> 46:08.150
Dynamic Duo you two are not.

46:08.220 --> 46:09.920
What happened to your face?

46:09.980 --> 46:12.320
Oh, I got punched.
What's your excuse?

46:12.390 --> 46:13.750
Oh!

46:13.860 --> 46:15.160
I love this guy!

46:18.460 --> 46:21.130
Thanks for watching the kids
last night, Grandpa.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.630
Are you serious? I want to be
the first one you call.

46:24.700 --> 46:27.730
I got my nails done. Huh?

46:27.870 --> 46:30.040
- Fancy.
- Yeah.

46:30.910 --> 46:33.880
Uh, how was work?

46:33.880 --> 46:36.310
What was all that
miscommunication about?

46:36.380 --> 46:39.010
Oh, uh, Brad Lewis
wasn't the issue.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.710
It was Abraham Persikoff.

46:40.780 --> 46:42.380
One of yours?

46:43.680 --> 46:45.720
He cause any problems?

46:45.790 --> 46:47.220
None at all.

46:47.290 --> 46:49.090
Apparently he got confused

46:49.160 --> 46:50.990
about what day
he had to be in court.

46:52.130 --> 46:54.100
And, uh, Pete's face?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.100
Oh, I, uh, I did that.

46:58.170 --> 47:01.340
We were roughhousing.
Have you seen these?

47:01.400 --> 47:04.470
You do not survive
a battle with these
unscathed.

47:04.540 --> 47:07.340
Take it down,
take it out!

47:07.410 --> 47:08.940
How old are you two?

47:09.010 --> 47:13.580
Carly got a B+
on her algebra midterm.

47:13.650 --> 47:14.780
Way to go, Carly.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.820
What?

47:17.920 --> 47:19.220
That's what I'm talking about.

47:19.290 --> 47:21.690
- I'm very proud of you.
- Yes.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.090
Grandma, will you
pass me the gravy?

47:23.160 --> 47:24.460
Pete, could you pass that?

47:24.530 --> 47:26.090
Got it. Thank you.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.930
You give good,
good gravy.

47:28.930 --> 47:30.430
It was a hard one, too.

47:30.500 --> 47:33.600
That's good, baby.
That's good, good, good.

48:02.730 --> 48:04.130
Pete?

48:05.330 --> 48:06.970
Okay?

48:08.370 --> 48:09.640
Yeah, I'm good.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.810
Congratulations
on your B-.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.020
It was a B+.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.290
I was always
a lousy student.

48:25.350 --> 48:27.150
I couldn't buy
a mark that good.

48:31.830 --> 48:33.330
Obviously, uh,

48:33.390 --> 48:35.000
we got off
on the wrong foot.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.500
I'm re-- I'm really
sorry about that.

48:40.070 --> 48:42.440
I-- I can't--
I can't force you

48:42.500 --> 48:45.570
to, uh, to trust
or even like me.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.740
I'm just trying to figure
this all out myself.

48:47.810 --> 48:49.440
It's all new
territory for me.

48:49.510 --> 48:51.050
I can't tell you
how long it's been

48:51.110 --> 48:53.610
since I've been around
a normal family.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.750
Normal?

48:54.820 --> 48:56.080
You know what I mean.

48:58.020 --> 49:01.090
Anyways, can I make
a suggestion?

49:01.160 --> 49:03.190
And I know this is
probably really weird.

49:03.260 --> 49:05.490
But can we start over?

49:10.100 --> 49:13.600
Hi, Carly.
I'm Pete, your cousin.

49:15.940 --> 49:17.700
Come on. They do it
in the movies.

49:17.770 --> 49:19.340
Come on. Just do it.

49:20.940 --> 49:22.440
Come on.

49:22.510 --> 49:25.250
Come on. Just do it.

49:36.890 --> 49:38.460
- Eddie.
- Marius.

49:38.530 --> 49:40.790
Where were you, man?
I was there.

49:40.860 --> 49:42.300
I waited for, like, an hour.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.730
Yeah, I saw you there.

49:48.140 --> 49:50.400
Uh, nothing?

49:51.840 --> 49:53.210
Come on, Eddie.
Give me a story,

49:53.270 --> 49:55.080
something to make me
trust you again.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.150
They saw me get off
the subway, man.

49:58.210 --> 50:00.680
They knew something was up,
but I led them away.

50:00.750 --> 50:02.080
You just come back.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.420
I miss you, man.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.250
Oh, shut up.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.590
You're not good at this.

50:05.650 --> 50:07.550
You've never
been good at this.

50:07.620 --> 50:09.420
That's why this is
so stupid, Eddie.

50:09.490 --> 50:11.560
What did they
promise you?

50:13.690 --> 50:16.200
They said if I
help them find you...

50:16.260 --> 50:17.760
they wouldn't kill you.

50:17.830 --> 50:19.670
And that sounded like
a good deal to you?

50:19.730 --> 50:21.470
Huh? Oh, that's
the perfect deal?

50:21.540 --> 50:23.800
They throw a little money
on top of that?

50:23.870 --> 50:26.610
He's trying to help you,
jackass.

50:28.280 --> 50:31.550
Jesus.
You are so stubborn.

50:31.610 --> 50:33.010
God damn.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.350
Look, Marius,

50:34.420 --> 50:36.280
I'm going to make this
short, okay?

50:36.350 --> 50:38.350
I'm a very reasonable man,

50:38.420 --> 50:42.690
but even reasonable men
have limitations, okay?

50:45.390 --> 50:49.160
You stole from me.
I can't have that.

50:49.230 --> 50:51.170
But now you're back, right?

50:51.230 --> 50:52.900
So here's what we're
going to do.

50:52.970 --> 50:57.000
I'm going to give you a week
to give me my money.

50:57.070 --> 50:58.440
If you don't...

51:01.210 --> 51:03.940
I'm going to take
your brother's hand

51:04.010 --> 51:05.780
and a bolt cutter,

51:05.850 --> 51:08.650
and I'm going
to snip off a finger.

51:09.750 --> 51:11.020
Next week,

51:11.150 --> 51:13.450
snip off another one.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.320
All right?

51:18.690 --> 51:21.360
Pretty soon I'm going
to run out of fingers.

51:22.230 --> 51:23.400
Then what?

51:26.870 --> 51:28.640
Vance, you're going
to be wasting your time

51:28.700 --> 51:32.170
because I really don't care
about my brother anymore.

51:38.010 --> 51:39.510
Heh heh. Y-You know,

51:39.580 --> 51:42.850
you had me
for about two seconds.

51:44.550 --> 51:47.190
You got seven days, Marius.

51:58.830 --> 51:59.900
Hey, Pete.

51:59.970 --> 52:02.240
Didn't want to disturb you.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.040
Hey, Grandma.

52:04.100 --> 52:05.070
Got to get the eggs

52:05.210 --> 52:06.270
for tomorrow's breakfast.

52:06.340 --> 52:07.570
Everything all right?

52:08.910 --> 52:12.250
Oh, yeah, I was
just on the phone
with a friend.

52:12.310 --> 52:15.080
If I don't get these
out of here tonight,

52:15.220 --> 52:17.650
there's a fox who will.

52:20.750 --> 52:24.330
Little bastard
coming into our house,

52:24.390 --> 52:27.230
staking a claim
to what isn't his.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.660
We can't have that, can we?

52:32.600 --> 52:33.830
No, ma'am.

52:35.770 --> 52:36.840
Okay.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.770
Oh, that's enough.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.240
Thanks.
