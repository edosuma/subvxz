00:04.130 --> 00:05.165
I'm Calvert.

00:08.259 --> 00:11.046
If you want to save Pree,
I want you to swap this

00:11.137 --> 00:12.343
for his ID badge.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.503
Ifyou can help me
do this cleanly,

00:14.599 --> 00:16.590

00:20.938 --> 00:23.475
Welcome to the party.
This ship is ours.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.522
They're Qreshi.
Could be a rescue team.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.941
JOHN: If that's a rescue team,

00:27.028 --> 00:28.643
then why did he just
plant a fusion bomb

00:28.738 --> 00:30.319
that could take out
half this ship?

00:30.406 --> 00:32.021
COREN: Let's get
those Qreshi pricks.

00:32.909 --> 00:34.865
lt's Johnny.
He sent a message.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.533
PREE: Herks has been hijacked.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.157
Qreshis trying
to blow up the ship.

NEWCY: There's an
orbiter-class cruiser ship

00:39.916 --> 00:41.326
approaching at high speed.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.748
It's the Armada.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.575
Warden, what did you do
with those fusion bombs?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.331
(EXPLODING)

00:46.422 --> 00:47.753

Before she went offline,
Lucy told me something.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.836
The hatchlings are clones.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.762
So ifwe find The Lady's
realbody”.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.932
Then you put the rest
of the species on
the endangered list.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.654
D'AVIN: Nice View.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.438

01:15.618 --> 01:17.074
I don't hate them.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.910
So you think it worked?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.613
She bought
the explosion?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.078
They haven't found us
or shot at us,

01:25.169 --> 01:26.454
so I'm taking that
as a good sign.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.130
Maybe...

01:37.348 --> 01:38.713
we're actually free.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.883
Maybe we could
just go, you know?

01:45.064 --> 01:46.770
This is probably
our last chance.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.694
There are other homes
and other moons.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.235
Maybe we let
someone else
take this fight.

at this scan

Dutch is right.

Thank you.

About what?

06:32.184 --> 06:34.971
That the hatchlings
are clones of The Lady's
full-grown body.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.927
This is a bio-sim
of the one that
Dutch stole.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.808

something like this.

I hooked Newcy
up to the ship's system,

what a full-grown version

might look like.

We're not winning
a ballistics fight

The only way
we're gonna know
that she's dead

07:12.516 --> 07:14.222
is ifwe sneak on there
and actually watch her die.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.042
How do you remote-map
an alien ship?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.217
I'm glad you asked.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.088
By bouncing a low-level
wireless signal through it

09:59.183 --> 10:01.344
to build a 3D holo-map
and beam it back to us.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.302
How? You need some sort
of receiver on board
the ship.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.681
Got one. Newcy.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.101
A Newcy's physical form
is still parked

send her instructions

embedded in a signal form
that won't be suspicious.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.612

Micro.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.618
Just look like basic CMB
if they notice it.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.030
Ah. Smart.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.784
So... you want my systems.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.920
Oh, I've been all up
in your systems, thank you.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.506
We can't send it from here.
We can't take that chance.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.175
But there is a satellite
on Leith with enough range.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.763
It's just
on a military base.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.383
What do you want, Killjoy?

10:41.475 --> 10:43.215
An escape pod,
your undying support,

10:43.310 --> 10:46.802
and... a few prisoners.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.522
Contender number one,
meet Bodie.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.145
Bodie was
a fourth-rank
private.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.567
He likes warm walks
on cold beaches,

10:53.654 --> 10:55.360
the blood of his enemy,
and cake.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.358
Oh, no, wait a minute.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.235
Cannibal.
Oh, damn.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.692
Wait, like, good people,
or, you know, bad people?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.913
Just people
in general, really.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.457
Lots of people.
I'm better now.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.206
Sorry. We're gonna pass.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.161
PRISONER:
I get it. It's fair.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.963
Which leaves us with...

11:15.425 --> 11:17.131
Distinguished marksman award,

11:17.219 --> 11:19.426
12 years' service,
mech division.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.339
Never touch my pudding!
(GRUNTS)

11:24.518 --> 11:25.803
Oh, hey, guys.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.685
What's up?
DUTCH: She's military?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.392
She's the only
ranking Leithian
on the ship.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.643
If this was just
a regular mission,
we could wing it with D'av,

11:32.734 --> 11:35.020
but with these stakes
and no time to prep?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.689
We gotta fit in.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.612
How'd you like
a day pass?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.191
D'AVIN: It’s a
need-to-know operation.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.571
CALVERT: I don't even care!

11:43.662 --> 11:46.074
You guys are the best
for breaking me out!

11:46.164 --> 11:48.541
Oh, trees!
Look at them!

11:48.625 --> 11:50.832
Oh, and grass!

11:51.962 --> 11:53.293
Do you remember grass?

11:54.089 --> 11:55.750
Is she okay?
Hey!

11:56.341 --> 11:58.923
Tree-humper,
stop scissoring
nature and focus.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.251
We didn't
bust you out.
You're on a mission.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.677
And if you
cock it up,

12:02.764 --> 12:05.096
we will fry you
with Rennika's
brain chip.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.172
Understood?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.604
Understood.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.644
Can you get us
inside the base
or not, Lieutenant?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.270
Yes, sir.
Good. Take point.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.279
Ifanyone
IDs us in there,
we are toast.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.651
We'll lose our only
tactical advantage

12:22.743 --> 12:24.529
with The Lady,
so if shit goes wrong,

12:24.828 --> 12:27.160
use any force necessary
to get us out. Agreed?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.529
BOTH: Agreed.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.536
(PEOPLE CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY)

12:37.049 --> 12:39.256
Okay, I'm less agreed now.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.006
D'AVIN:
What the Shit is this?

12:43.555 --> 12:46.137
"This three-tier
communications base

12:46.224 --> 12:49.808
"proudly offers you
the best in cutting-edge
Mili-tainment"?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.553
Is this a base
or a goddamn theme park?

12:52.648 --> 12:53.933
Both.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.223
We're not
a well-funded army.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.274
Qresh cuts our balls off
every year with sanctions

12:58.362 --> 13:00.694
so we don't get any big ideas,
so tourism pays the bills.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.396
Mili-tainment is huge.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.028
I hate every word
you just said.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.495
Easy, soldier.
The mission stays
the same, right?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.570
We get in there,
send the signal,
and get out.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.793
JOHN:
So we can't get caught,
'cause we can't even

13:16.880 --> 13:18.086
shoot our way out now.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.624
How are we supposed to fit in
with happy, normal people?

13:22.719 --> 13:25.711
This might be our greatest
undercover challenge yet.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.641
WOMAN OVER PA: War! War! War!
The biggest bombs
take the biggest balls!

13:34.731 --> 13:37.268
Test yours in our new
VF defusing sim

13:37.359 --> 13:38.724
in the west atrium.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.688
I feel like somebody
took everything
lbeHevedin

13:40.779 --> 13:42.110
and peed on it.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.487
Okay, talked
to the door greeter.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.702
Lovely woman. We have
free passes to the
laser show tonight,

13:47.786 --> 13:49.742
and it sounds like
the lower levels

13:49.830 --> 13:52.788
are off-limits to civilians.
Strictly military personnel.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.705
That's where your tech
will be then, makes sense.

13:54.793 --> 13:55.999
In what way does
any of this make
any sense?

13:56.878 --> 13:59.369
Try living it.
Why do you think
I turned to crime?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.329
Because you have
the morals of a small
braised cabbage.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.045
Mmm.
Okay, John,

14:04.136 --> 14:05.717
go with Calvert.
Do your thing.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.294
Dutch and lwill
watch your exits.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.549
Good?
Good.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.050
Come on.
Mmm.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.759
Why "braised"?
I mean, I'm not angry,

14:13.854 --> 14:15.594
I'm just hungry now.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.693
ZEPH: On my signal.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.783
I'm sorry.
You want me to what?

14:30.871 --> 14:32.486
Okay, just run it
for us again.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.071
We can't risk
this thing escaping,

14:34.166 --> 14:36.623
but I need to get
a good look at it.
So you guys hold it steady,

14:36.710 --> 14:38.621
I'll drill a hole
in the top, drop the
surgical camera inside,

14:38.712 --> 14:40.373
you seal it up.
Okay.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.376
Oh! No. And hell no,
and then no again.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.503
What if the box cracks?
We scream and run and die.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.300
Goddamn it.
Next time,
I make the plans.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.888
What are you doing?

14:48.972 --> 14:51.930
Getting my boot ready
in case we have to
stomp the shitty bitch.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.382
Let's get this over with.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.264
Okay, we do this
on three.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.764
Ready?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.767
One, two...

15:00.650 --> 15:01.810
No, wait!

15:02.861 --> 15:05.193
If this thing gets out
and jumps on my face,

15:05.280 --> 15:06.895
I want you to...
Mercy kill you.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.777
Fight for me!
Yes, okay. That too.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.608
Okay, ready?
Mmm-hmm.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.863
Let's do some science.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.496
He didn't like it!
I don't like it!

15:17.584 --> 15:19.120
Okay, I'm in!
I'm in, I'm in,
I'm in!

15:19.211 --> 15:20.451
Ahhh!

15:20.545 --> 15:21.751
ZEPH: Dropping the camera!

15:22.380 --> 15:23.631
(GAGGING)

15:23.715 --> 15:25.296
There it goes! Seal it up!

15:25.425 --> 15:27.416
Seal it! Seal it!
(SCREAMS)

15:34.601 --> 15:35.841
Did it work?

15:44.402 --> 15:46.313
What?
Nothing.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.816
You just scream a lot
for a warlord.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.649
It's "warlord,"
not "bug lord."

15:52.035 --> 15:53.275
Mmm-hmm.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.908
Okay, I do hate this
war-tainment shit...

15:58.750 --> 16:01.867
but look at
all these happy,
goofy bastards.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.125
Must be nice to live
in a world so safe,
they barely have an army.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.806
Hi.
Hi.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.798
Hi.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.928
What's your presentation?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.008
Uh...

16:21.064 --> 16:22.270
Oh...

16:22.858 --> 16:24.018
The tour.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.860
We're not...

16:25.944 --> 16:27.309
We're just...

16:27.404 --> 16:28.519
MAN: The tour's starting.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.817
We're closed.
MAN: They're starting.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.284
They're just getting started.
D'AVIN: You know what...

16:34.578 --> 16:36.284
Take it away,
Lieutenant.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.784
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
No. No, no, no, no.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.412
Over to you... Chief.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.997
Not really a thing.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.541
Okay, Leith history.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.250
Topic close to my heart,

16:52.971 --> 16:56.509
and of which I am...

16:57.475 --> 16:59.090
very well-informed.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.601
Okay, recording.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.474
We have a live visual.

17:15.785 --> 17:16.911
What the hells
we looking at?

17:16.995 --> 17:18.826
Uh... Is that...

17:18.914 --> 17:21.530
Is that upside-down, or...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.616
No, I think I see a fin?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.412
A face.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.709
A fin-face?

17:27.130 --> 17:29.496
Wait, is that its ass,
or its mouth?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.582
It's alien.
Maybe its ass
is its mouth.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.632
Oh, good. We know what
its shitter looks like.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.800
Victory is ours.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.597
Shit. Hold on.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.595
What happened?
Did it break the camera?
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

17:41.686 --> 17:42.846
I think it ate it.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.178
(CLANGING)

17:46.524 --> 17:49.516
Well, what the hells now?
Shh! Be patient.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.727
There's gotta be at least
one good, clear frame in here.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.354
As you do... Ah-ha!

17:56.493 --> 17:57.824
Sorta.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.822
Superior species,
my ass.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.575
That's some kind
of octopus-spider shithead.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.532
What?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.117
I've seen it before.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.581
When Dutch was
in the hatchery?

18:09.673 --> 18:10.662
No,no,no.
Before, before.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.293
Where?
I don't know!

18:12.384 --> 18:15.046
Company records,
or old RAC research files.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.797
Okay, good.
This is good.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.970
So do an image search
through all the old files.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.422
Let's find out
what we're fighting.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.506
We can't from here.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.808
The Lady's blocked everything
to protect the delusion.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.637
We can't have access to that
without a hacked direct line.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.855
Like the one in your lab.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.818
We have to go back
to Old Town.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.354
(SIGHS)

18:33.196 --> 18:34.732
Hut.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.189
Hut.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.281
Clear.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.996
Remember the salute
ifwe see anyone.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.492
Is that the head tap
or the overly complicated
handshake?

18:44.582 --> 18:45.958
What is with
you people?
I don't know!

18:46.042 --> 18:47.703
Less wars you have,
the more time you have

18:47.794 --> 18:49.625
for fancy traditions
that make you feel
important.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.328
You should see our parades.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.913
Do you guys have
clearance for
this area?

18:53.216 --> 18:55.582
Do you outrank me, son?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.383
Because I don't
think you
outrank me.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.007
No, ma'am.
Winter salute!

19:01.975 --> 19:03.556
Tuck in your shirt.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.389
Now go outside
and run the pretzel
formation

19:06.479 --> 19:08.686
till I come for you.
Real soldiers have
work to do.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.729
Yes, ma'am.
Apologies.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.683
Oops. Forgot
my anger meds.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.393
Come on. I think
that bought us
20 minutes.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.903
PREE: Great.
Now I've got blisters
on my blisters.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.031
We do this and get out.
There's still heat
on us here.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.613
Once we get to the lab,
we're gonna go find Gared.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.949
This little rebellion
is short-staffed as shit.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.454
Time to find my...

19:31.671 --> 19:32.956
baby.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.126
Uh...

19:36.176 --> 19:37.461
Where did everybody go?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.879
Okay, really need
to fear-pee now.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.472
I may
join you in that.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.056
(CLANGING)

19:52.650 --> 19:54.811
Zeph, you carrying?
Shit. No.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.936
Then be a lamb
and find some cover?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.896
You go for the lab.
I'm going for Gared.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.731
Make sure he's not
still here
somewhere.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.077
Ready?
What?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.114
Wait, no!
Run!

20:05.205 --> 20:06.194
It's a goddamn kill squad.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.369
Go, go, go!

20:07.624 --> 20:09.285
(GUNS FIRING)

20:16.800 --> 20:20.088
Well, good news
is The Lady's dummies didn't
even know what to smash.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.590
All right. I'll never
make coffee again,

20:23.681 --> 20:25.296
but my computer rig
is still alive.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.347
Okay.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.649
Okay, I'm in.
This may take a while.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.361
Kind of wish
we had that coffee.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.700
Still clear,
but I'd hurry up.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.664
Well, hello, beautiful.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.746
Let's get our sat tech on.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.286
Okay, Nuce.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.871
When you're done,
let me know,
and I'll let her rip.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.582
NEWCY:
Beginning upload. Stand by.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.963
What happens
if this doesn't work,
you get fired or something?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.921

32:19.480 --> 32:21.141
I think a couple
more weeks.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.312
Maybe.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.975
I can't let you
go home right now,
Calvert.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.398
People will recognize you,
and once word gets out

32:28.489 --> 32:30.480
that the prison ship
has survivors,

32:31.033 --> 32:32.989
she'll come for my team,
and she'll win.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.739
And then none of us
will have a home
to go back to,

32:35.830 --> 32:37.366
'cause ifwe don't
stop her on Westerley,

32:37.456 --> 32:38.787
she's coming
for Leith next.

32:39.542 --> 32:40.873
What's your
daughter's name?

32:41.710 --> 32:42.870
Harper.

32:44.713 --> 32:45.839
She's ten.

32:46.924 --> 32:48.414
I haven't seen her
in eight years.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.836
All I need is
two more weeks.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.169
Give us a chance
to fight,

32:53.764 --> 32:55.971
and then lwill bring you
back here myself

32:56.058 --> 32:58.674
and I'll tell your kid
that her mother helped
save the damn world.

Last of my ammo.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.060
Maybe there aren't
many more left.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.946
Or it's
a death squad
jamboree.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.776
TURIN:
Look, no pressure,
but we need a plan,

33:16.871 --> 33:18.611
'cause ifwe die here,
it's all over,

33:18.706 --> 33:20.913
we may have
just destroyed
the universe, et cetera.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.412
Well, don't look at me.
I've whiffed the ball
every step.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.247
Pip, Fancy...

33:25.337 --> 33:26.793
Now Dutch and the boys
are gonna come here,

33:26.881 --> 33:28.917
expecting I did my part,
and I'm gonna
fail them, too.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.498
You were right.

33:30.593 --> 33:32.049
I'm better off
in the lab than
the field.

33:32.386 --> 33:33.751
And I said this when?

33:33.846 --> 33:35.711
When we first met.
You were a shithead to me.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.762
I'm a shithead to everyone.
It's my brand.

33:38.559 --> 33:41.016
Don't be so fragile.
No one asked you to put

33:41.103 --> 33:42.764
the world on
your shoulders.
Don't volunteer.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.391
Turin. I don't know
how to do this.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.732
I don't know how
to save everyone.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.272
We don't get
to save everyone,

33:47.735 --> 33:49.942
so we gotta be smart
about who we do save.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.395
Look, forget
what I said
aboutyou.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.026
Forget about
your shitty family,
or what Dutch needs.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.826
You're the good stuff, Zeph.
You're the best stuff we got.

33:58.913 --> 34:00.699
So trust your gut,

34:00.789 --> 34:01.995
and watch your head.
What?

34:02.082 --> 34:03.208
No!

34:04.126 --> 34:05.957
I'm gonna lead these
bug bastards west.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.252
Once you break this down,
it should be safe out here.

34:08.339 --> 34:10.045

Get to the Royale.

34:10.174 --> 34:12.130
Use the tunnels.
I'll join you if I can.

can do this so much faster?

34:23.687 --> 34:26.520
Can we please not talk
about my brother while
we're rubbing asses?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.268
Oh, that's your line?

34:28.359 --> 34:30.315
Yes. "Johnny"
is my safe word.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.525
Okay, hang on.
I think we're close.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.106
Yeah, I've been close
since we started.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.317

I'm gonna get
one of us pregnant.

come and save us.

Hey...

34:55.678 --> 34:58.966
Johnny told me about
your Killjoy sabbatical idea.

35:00.391 --> 35:01.847
Are you really
okay with that?

35:02.476 --> 35:03.556
Yeah.

35:03.644 --> 35:04.759

35:05.521 --> 35:07.057
D'Avin, are you
trying to use

35:07.147 --> 35:08.808

my feelings?

35:15.656 --> 35:16.736
Fine.

about Johnny leaving.
