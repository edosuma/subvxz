01:29.249 --> 01:32.127
-Wait a minute, will you? l'll be right out.
-All right.

01:39.089 --> 01:40.363
The doorbell's ringing.

01:40.449 --> 01:41.768
Yes, l know.

01:47.489 --> 01:49.445
Well, l'm not expecting anybody.

01:49.529 --> 01:50.484
Neither am l.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.083
Come on, open up.

01:53.169 --> 01:55.046
Why, that's Johnny Case.

01:55.609 --> 01:58.601
Open up. Open up or l'll break it down.

01:59.769 --> 02:01.282
-Johnny.
-Hello, Susan.

02:01.369 --> 02:03.087
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Nick.

02:03.169 --> 02:06.605
Get out of Johnny's arms and
let him come in. When did you get back?

02:06.689 --> 02:08.839
Few minutes ago.
l didn't have time to go home.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.282
-Mind if l leave my grips here?
-No.

02:10.369 --> 02:13.361
-You both look fine. So long.
-Wait, we haven't seen you in two weeks.

02:13.449 --> 02:16.247
-You can't run away.
-l've got a date. There's a cab waiting.

02:16.329 --> 02:18.001
-What of it?
-Have some breakfast.

02:18.089 --> 02:21.047
-How was your vacation?
-Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.357
Guess he liked it.

02:22.449 --> 02:25.202
l must go. She's waiting.
l haven't seen her since Wednesday.

02:25.289 --> 02:26.688
-She? Who?
-My wife.

02:26.769 --> 02:31.160
-Nick, did you hear the man?
-The room is going round and round.

02:31.369 --> 02:34.759
She's not exactly my wife yet.
But she's going to be. lt's all arranged.

02:35.169 --> 02:38.286
Take it easy, now.
Everything will be all right.

02:38.369 --> 02:40.644
-Lie down right there.
-Wait a minute.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.202
That's it now.
Tell us all about it from the beginning.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.483
-Who is she?
-What's her name?

02:45.569 --> 02:47.241
-Why marry her?
-How'd you meet?

02:47.329 --> 02:49.047
-What does she do?
-Come, boy.

02:49.129 --> 02:50.118
Wait.

02:51.889 --> 02:54.403
lt's love, fellows. l've met the girl.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.164
She is <i>....</i>

02:56.329 --> 03:00.083
l can't describe her, but the first thing
you notice are her dimples when she smiles.

03:00.169 --> 03:04.128
-Why didn't you say so in the first place?
-That's going to make her the perfect wife.

03:04.209 --> 03:07.326
l've found her.
l didn't think they came that way anymore.

03:07.409 --> 03:09.718
She's sweet, intelligent,
the perfect playmate.

03:09.809 --> 03:11.959
Listen, you haven't told us anything yet.

03:12.049 --> 03:14.802
We're not letting any wench
snag you without a struggle.

03:14.889 --> 03:18.325
-Who is this girl? What does she do?
-l don't know. What do most girls do?

03:18.409 --> 03:20.969
Don't tell me
you didn't find out anything about her?

03:21.049 --> 03:24.405
Sure. She wants me, the life l want,
the home l want, the fun l want.

03:24.489 --> 03:26.798
-What about her family?
-What about her family?

03:26.889 --> 03:28.117
What about her family?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.404
-Didn't you find out anything about them?
-No.

03:31.049 --> 03:34.325
Sure, l did. She's got a brother,
a sister and a father.

03:34.409 --> 03:37.526
Now is that good enough?
Come on, Nick, really, l've got to go.

03:37.609 --> 03:39.201
Come on, fellow, up.

03:39.449 --> 03:42.486
Thanks. l'll be late. Where's my hat?

03:44.449 --> 03:47.805
-Well, what do you make of it?
-l can see the whole thing.

03:47.969 --> 03:50.802
Father, too old to work.
Brother, a pool shark.

03:50.889 --> 03:53.562
Sister can't keep a job
on account of she's too pretty.

03:53.649 --> 03:57.119
Poor little Dimples has to work her fingers
to the bone to support them.

03:57.209 --> 03:58.688
Wouldn't that be marvellous?

03:58.769 --> 04:01.237
Johnny Case comes into her life
and takes her away.

04:01.329 --> 04:03.126
-Here's your hat. l give up.
-Thanks.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.485
'Bye, Susan. 'Bye, Nick. l'll drop in later
and tell you all about her.

04:06.569 --> 04:08.605
-Johnny?
-What?

04:09.529 --> 04:14.523
Listen, when you find yourself with a family
to support and things get tough <i>....</i>

04:14.609 --> 04:17.680
Teaching at the university
doesn't pay me very much, but <i>....</i>

04:17.769 --> 04:22.524
That's sweet, but when things get tough,
when l feel a worry coming on...

04:22.609 --> 04:24.281
...you know what l do.

04:26.569 --> 04:28.560
There. And then the worries are over.

04:28.649 --> 04:30.162
Good-bye, you comics.

04:30.249 --> 04:31.477
Good luck, Johnny.

04:40.689 --> 04:43.249
-What's this?
-You said 843, didn't you?

04:43.329 --> 04:44.523
Yeah, but <i>....</i>

04:51.769 --> 04:54.044
l guess she must work here.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.644
Thanks, bud.

05:13.169 --> 05:15.046
lt's the ice-cream man.

05:16.809 --> 05:19.528
Excuse me.
Does a Miss Julia Seton live here?

05:21.889 --> 05:23.607
Miss Seton gave me this address.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.725
My name is Case, John Case.

05:26.249 --> 05:28.717
Miss Julia is expecting you, Mr. Case.

05:28.809 --> 05:30.288
Then she does live here?

05:31.929 --> 05:35.717
l beg your pardon,
but it's the usual custom...

05:35.809 --> 05:39.119
...for Miss Julia's callers
to arrive at the front door.

05:40.409 --> 05:41.364
l'm sorry.

05:41.449 --> 05:44.759
-lf you'll come this way, Mr. Case.
-Thanks.

05:44.849 --> 05:45.804
Excuse me.

06:07.569 --> 06:08.524
Judas!

06:09.209 --> 06:10.801
l beg your pardon?

06:11.529 --> 06:13.679
l just said, ''Judas.''
lt didn't mean anything.

06:13.769 --> 06:16.329
lf you'll leave your hat and coat here, sir.

06:23.409 --> 06:24.683
Thank you.

06:31.729 --> 06:32.957
Good morning, Mr. Ned.

06:33.049 --> 06:36.519
Your father has just left for church.
He said he couldn't wait for you.

06:36.609 --> 06:40.045
-Did l get home all right last night?
-Everything is perfectly all right, sir.

06:40.129 --> 06:45.044
-How did l get this bump on my forehead?
-You slipped in your bathroom.

06:47.809 --> 06:50.687
l'll want a drink in my room
as soon as l get home from church.

06:50.769 --> 06:51.724
Yes, sir.

06:53.409 --> 06:54.728
Say, this <i>....</i>

06:55.289 --> 06:56.961
What do people <i>....</i>

06:57.209 --> 06:59.359
lf you'll come this way, sir.

07:21.329 --> 07:23.718
lf you'll wait in the living room, sir.

07:23.849 --> 07:25.441
The second button.

07:28.209 --> 07:30.882
l shall notify Miss Julia that you are here.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.920
l could have walked that.

08:29.689 --> 08:30.838
Johnny.

08:31.049 --> 08:32.004
Johnny.

08:32.208 --> 08:33.437
Darling.

08:33.529 --> 08:34.881
Darling.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.404
-Hello, sweet.
-Hello.

08:44.609 --> 08:46.088
Johnny, mind your manners.

08:53.129 --> 08:56.007
-Darling, where are we?
-Where l live.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.803
You promised to change that tie.

08:59.049 --> 09:00.277
That hair.

09:00.409 --> 09:03.162
Julia, seriously, what is all this?

09:03.329 --> 09:04.682
l told you, where l live.

09:04.769 --> 09:07.158
l wrote it down
on the back of an envelope for you.

09:08.169 --> 09:12.162
But it's enormous. l'm overcome.
lt's the Grand Central Station.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.078
Bad echo.

09:17.169 --> 09:19.842
Stop criticizing this house
or l'll send for the bouncer.

09:19.929 --> 09:22.489
-Stop. Now l'm off to church.
-Wait.

09:22.849 --> 09:24.567
Do you want to know what happened?

09:24.649 --> 09:27.641
-l went to the kitchen door to ask for you.
-You didn't.

09:27.729 --> 09:30.448
l figured you were a secretary
or an old lady's companion.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.645
-You sure you aren't?
-Cross my heart.

09:33.409 --> 09:36.799
-What's that silly thing? Look at that.
-Stop it, Johnny.

09:38.209 --> 09:40.086
You must all be so rich.

09:40.489 --> 09:42.286
Well, we aren't exactly poor.

09:42.369 --> 09:44.678
You should have told me, you really should.

09:44.769 --> 09:46.964
-Would it have made any difference?
-Certainly.

09:47.049 --> 09:50.200
l'd have asked you to marry me
in two days instead of ten.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.598
-Aren't you funny?
-Funny, why?

09:52.689 --> 09:54.168
Well, to talk about it.

09:54.249 --> 09:57.446
-Money? Why, is it so sacred?
-No, of course not.

09:57.529 --> 09:59.281
l'm simply delighted. That's all.

09:59.369 --> 10:02.327
lf l suddenly discovered
you could play piano, l'd be delighted.

10:02.409 --> 10:04.798
Having money
is like knowing how to play the piano?

10:04.889 --> 10:07.801
Well, they're both
very pleasant accomplishments for a girl.

10:07.889 --> 10:11.848
Don't worry, if l'm stuck with a rich girl
l'll grit my teeth and make the best of it.

10:11.929 --> 10:15.126
-But you're going to make millions yourself.
-But, no, l'm not.

10:15.209 --> 10:17.165
-Yes, you are.
-No.

10:17.249 --> 10:20.002
-Yes.
-No, not Mr. Case's little boy.

10:20.089 --> 10:23.479
l'm a plain man of the people.
l began life with these two bare hands.

10:23.569 --> 10:27.005
So did the gentleman over the fireplace.
Take heart from Grandfather.

10:30.009 --> 10:34.844
-Don't tell me you're one of those Setons?
-Yes, Johnny. Forgive us, but we are.

10:35.409 --> 10:36.842
This is too much.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.239
What man has done, man can do,
or words to that effect.

10:40.649 --> 10:46.281
Now see here, if you think l'm going to be
any young wizard of finance, you're <i>....</i>

10:46.369 --> 10:48.644
Cheer up, it's not at all that serious.

10:48.809 --> 10:52.484
lf you don't think breaking the news
of this engagement to Father is serious <i>....</i>

10:52.569 --> 10:55.686
-You said you were going to church?
-l am. That's why l'm clever.

10:55.769 --> 10:58.488
Because Father's in church
and in church Father can't talk.

10:58.729 --> 11:01.766
-Are you that afraid of him?
-No. But this is the best way.

11:01.849 --> 11:05.285
You know, Father is a wonderful man,
but he has to be handled just right.

11:05.369 --> 11:06.882
You leave that to me.

11:06.969 --> 11:10.279
Your job is to drop me off at church
and be back before 1 :00 for lunch...

11:10.369 --> 11:11.722
...and don't be late.

11:11.809 --> 11:14.369
His first impression of you
is terribly important.

11:14.449 --> 11:17.600
What if l crawled in on my hands
and knees? Would he like that?

11:17.849 --> 11:19.441
Now don't jest, boy.

11:20.209 --> 11:23.485
Now, come on, darling.
Let's not let the fun get out of it.

11:23.569 --> 11:26.447
-ls it likely to?
-No, but <i>....</i>

11:26.529 --> 11:27.678
Say it.

11:29.129 --> 11:32.166
Well, what's the idea of spilling it
so quickly?

11:32.329 --> 11:35.321
Well, l have to tell Father.
He'd never forgive me.

11:35.649 --> 11:39.039
Yeah, but it could be
such a swell guilty secret for a while.

11:39.649 --> 11:42.721
l can't see what particular fun
a secret would be.

11:44.089 --> 11:46.159
-Can't you, dear?
-No.

11:48.329 --> 11:49.603
All right.

11:53.929 --> 11:58.480
-lt's getting pretty complicated, isn't it?
-You didn't think it'd be simple, did you?

11:58.569 --> 12:01.561
-l suppose l just didn't think.
-You couldn't have.

12:03.169 --> 12:06.081
Johnny, what's the matter with you?

12:09.409 --> 12:12.128
l just hate the thought of sitting down
with another man...

12:12.209 --> 12:14.040
...and being practical about you.

12:19.969 --> 12:21.084
Angel.

12:22.529 --> 12:25.202
Look, darling, it's got to be done though.

12:26.129 --> 12:28.768
-l love you, Julia.
-l love you, Johnny.

12:28.929 --> 12:32.239
-That's the main thing, isn't it?
-Darling, that's everything.

12:33.409 --> 12:35.877
-Kiss?
-With pleasure.

12:39.569 --> 12:42.720
Why, Julia, for shame.
ls this the way to spend Sunday morning?

12:42.809 --> 12:44.845
Who's your partner, anyone l know?

12:45.289 --> 12:47.644
Johnny, my sister, Linda.
This is Johnny Case.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.640
-How do you do?
-Well, thanks, and you?

12:49.729 --> 12:51.162
-Couldn't be better.
-Good.

12:51.249 --> 12:54.446
-He's Johnny Case. l'll marry him.
-That makes it all right then.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.520
ln about one month l'll marry him, Linda.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.644
What?

12:58.449 --> 13:01.168
Stand out here in the light, will you, Case?

13:04.209 --> 13:07.599
-l've never seen him before.
-Neither had l until 10 days ago at Placid.

13:07.689 --> 13:10.283
But how did you get together?
Tell me everything.

13:10.369 --> 13:11.518
-l was <i>....</i>
-Well, l <i>....</i>

13:12.009 --> 13:13.488
Go ahead.

13:14.329 --> 13:17.207
l was walking along the road
one morning to the rink...

13:17.289 --> 13:20.599
...when whom should l see,
but this man coming along carrying his skis.

13:20.689 --> 13:23.761
Well, fancy that.
A downright romance. Go on, dear.

13:23.849 --> 13:26.044
He had a queer look on his face.

13:26.129 --> 13:28.563
l can believe that.
His eyes must have been burning.

13:28.649 --> 13:31.368
No. As a matter of fact,
the trouble was with his nose.

13:31.449 --> 13:32.882
So l stopped him and said:

13:32.969 --> 13:36.166
''Pardon me. l don't think you realize it,
but your nose is frozen.''

13:36.249 --> 13:39.400
He said, ''Thanks.
Can you personally do something about it?''

13:39.489 --> 13:41.002
-Fresh.
-l thought so, too.

13:41.089 --> 13:43.683
She was fresh to mention it.
lt looked to me like a pickup.

13:43.769 --> 13:45.487
l know a good thing when l see it.

13:45.569 --> 13:48.800
Just a minute.
Does Father know about these goings-on?

13:48.889 --> 13:50.880
l'm off to church to tell him now.

13:50.969 --> 13:52.800
This modern generation.

13:54.529 --> 13:58.204
Well, young man, l hope you realize
what you're getting yourself in for.

13:58.289 --> 14:01.087
l didn't know l was marrying
into a house with an elevator.

14:01.169 --> 14:03.285
lt isn't only the elevator.
The place is haunted.

14:03.369 --> 14:04.358
You mean ghosts?

14:04.449 --> 14:07.441
Frightful ghosts all wearing stuffed shirts
and mink-lined ties.

14:07.529 --> 14:09.008
Any skeletons in the closet?

14:09.089 --> 14:11.887
-Julia hasn't told you about Grandfather?
-No.

14:11.969 --> 14:14.802
-He stole a railroad from the stockholders.
-That's not true.

14:14.889 --> 14:17.642
And of course you've heard about me.
l'm the black sheep.

14:17.729 --> 14:18.764
That's a goat.

14:18.849 --> 14:21.079
-Don't pay attention to her.
-The engagement's off.

14:21.169 --> 14:23.399
l won't marry into any family
with a black sheep.

14:23.489 --> 14:25.047
-l think l like this man.
-Hello.

14:25.129 --> 14:27.927
You'll see him at lunch.
'Bye, darling, we've got to fly.

14:28.009 --> 14:29.727
See you at lunch, Sis.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.086
Placid was lovely, Father.

15:07.209 --> 15:10.201
l met a young man up there.
He's coming to lunch today.

15:15.209 --> 15:17.518
His name is Case. Johnny Case.

15:21.649 --> 15:24.243
-l'm going to marry him, Father.
-What?

15:27.489 --> 15:29.798
Did l understand you to say <i>....</i>

15:31.169 --> 15:33.125
And who may Johnny Chase be?

15:33.209 --> 15:35.803
-Case, Father, not Chase.
-Well, then, Case.

15:35.889 --> 15:37.038
Father.

15:45.449 --> 15:47.519
Will you please tell me <i>....</i>

15:56.169 --> 15:59.559
Marry? Did you actually say that?

16:09.409 --> 16:10.398
Charming service.

16:10.489 --> 16:12.366
-A lovely service.
-Thank you.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.644
-We shall have to talk at once, Julia.
-Yes.

16:14.729 --> 16:18.039
You haven't as yet told me
one intelligent fact about this <i>....</i>

16:18.329 --> 16:21.765
Johnny? He's a man with a definite future.
He's with Sloan and Hobson.

16:21.849 --> 16:23.646
-lndeed? l know Sam Hobson.
-You do?

16:23.729 --> 16:24.798
Hello, Julia.

16:25.209 --> 16:26.608
Hello, Marjorie. You look well.

16:26.689 --> 16:28.884
-A mild, lovely Sunday, Edward.
-Quite.

16:28.969 --> 16:31.437
-Did you have a little accident, Ned?
-So they say.

16:31.529 --> 16:33.679
l don't seem to have been there
when it happened.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.441
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

16:35.529 --> 16:36.564
Good morning.

16:36.649 --> 16:38.321
Kindly put your hat on, Ned.

16:38.409 --> 16:40.001
l believe l see Mr. Hobson now.

16:40.089 --> 16:41.920
-Run along home.
-Yes, Father.

16:42.009 --> 16:43.408
Take your time, Father.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.244
The front door this time.

16:46.329 --> 16:48.889
Miss Julia has not returned
from church yet, sir.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.243
l'll walk around the block.

16:52.329 --> 16:54.968
-You're expected in the playroom, sir.
-Playroom?

16:55.049 --> 16:58.166
Miss Linda asked that you be sent up
the moment you arrived, sir.

16:58.249 --> 16:59.398
Miss Linda.

16:59.489 --> 17:02.322
-The playroom is on the fourth floor, sir.
-Thanks.

17:15.648 --> 17:17.719
-Hey!
-Hey, yourself.

17:17.809 --> 17:18.877
l'm lost.

17:18.969 --> 17:21.688
A lot of people haven't been coming
up here. Want a bite?

17:21.769 --> 17:22.758
Thanks.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.444
The bell captain sent me up.

17:37.929 --> 17:41.046
This is quite different.
From the rest of the house, l mean.

17:41.129 --> 17:42.528
This was Mother's idea.

17:42.609 --> 17:45.885
She thought there should be
one fun room in the house.

17:45.969 --> 17:48.642
She used to be up here
as much as we were before she died.

17:48.729 --> 17:50.879
l think it was a kind of escape for her.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.527
She was marvellous.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.646
That's quite a doll.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.166
-That was Julia's.
-Yeah?

17:59.249 --> 18:00.682
She loved it.

18:01.489 --> 18:03.161
My, how she loved it.

18:03.409 --> 18:04.888
Looks like her.

18:06.089 --> 18:07.568
Did she love that, too?

18:07.649 --> 18:11.085
Now don't you say a word about Leopold.
He's very sensitive.

18:11.809 --> 18:14.118
-Yours?
-Looks like me.

18:21.449 --> 18:24.361
-Who's the musician in the family?
-My brother, Ned.

18:26.049 --> 18:29.837
l saw him this morning when l arrived.
At least l saw somebody with a hangover.

18:29.929 --> 18:31.328
That was Ned.

18:31.409 --> 18:33.365
He could have been a fine musician.

18:33.449 --> 18:36.282
-What do you mean?
-lf Father hadn't interfered.

18:36.369 --> 18:39.406
-Who performed on the flying trapeze?
-All of us.

18:39.609 --> 18:41.884
And a terrible cousin of ours
named Seton Cram.

18:41.969 --> 18:44.688
He and l used to swing by our knees
and spit at each other.

18:44.769 --> 18:48.079
-Nice goings-on.
-l'm happy to say now, l rarely missed.

18:48.289 --> 18:50.325
There's Julia and l as kids.

18:54.129 --> 18:56.927
She was beautiful even then, wasn't she?

18:58.929 --> 18:59.964
Case?

19:00.049 --> 19:01.118
What?

19:01.409 --> 19:05.004
l love my sister Julia
more than anything else in the world.

19:06.369 --> 19:08.246
l don't blame you, so do l.

19:08.329 --> 19:10.285
She's so sweet, you don't know.

19:10.529 --> 19:11.359
Yes, l do.

19:11.449 --> 19:14.361
She's beautiful and exciting, too,
don't you think?

19:14.449 --> 19:16.246
Stop it. l'll start jittering.

19:16.369 --> 19:20.078
lt's terribly important
that she should marry the right person.

19:21.049 --> 19:25.042
-That's important for everyone.
-No. lt's particularly so for Julia.

19:26.449 --> 19:30.158
l suppose you realize
you're a rather strange bird in these parts?

19:30.249 --> 19:31.284
How's that?

19:31.369 --> 19:34.202
You don't know the men we see as a rule.
Where've you been?

19:34.289 --> 19:35.324
Working hard.

19:35.409 --> 19:37.286
-Nights?
-Nights, too.

19:37.369 --> 19:40.486
What about these little jaunts to Placid?
Come clean, Case.

19:40.569 --> 19:43.641
Want to know something?
That was the first holiday l ever had.

19:43.729 --> 19:44.684
-No.
-Sure.

19:44.769 --> 19:48.159
-Then you can't have been working long.
-Only just since l was 10.

19:48.249 --> 19:49.443
-Ten?
-Sure.

19:49.529 --> 19:50.359
At what?

19:50.449 --> 19:53.680
Anything l could get.
Financial house the last few years.

19:55.009 --> 19:57.000
Does she paint? She never told me.

19:57.249 --> 19:58.921
No, you don't.

19:59.249 --> 20:01.809
-Why, isn't she any good?
-lt isn't hers, it's mine.

20:01.889 --> 20:04.801
There lies Linda the artist.
Don't disturb the ashes.

20:04.889 --> 20:06.447
Frankly, l stank.

20:06.689 --> 20:09.328
What did you try
after you discovered you couldn't paint?

20:09.409 --> 20:12.207
-Case, are you drawing me out?
-Sure. Come on.

20:13.289 --> 20:15.564
-You really want to know?
-Sure.

20:15.689 --> 20:18.203
Well, l tried to go on the stage.

20:18.769 --> 20:21.806
Would you care to see me
do the sleepwalking scene from <i>Macbeth</i> ?

20:22.009 --> 20:24.569
-''Out, damned spot!''
-No, some other time.

20:24.809 --> 20:28.040
The teachers at Miss Porter's School
thought it was very promising.

20:28.129 --> 20:30.962
-What else?
-There were lots of humorous episodes.

20:31.049 --> 20:34.200
l tried to get Father
to let me take a nursing course at a hospital.

20:34.289 --> 20:38.077
Yes, and l almost got arrested
trying to help some strikers over in Jersey.

20:38.169 --> 20:41.957
How was l to know that Father was
on the board of directors of the company?

20:42.049 --> 20:45.121
You see, Case, the trouble with me
is that l never could decide...

20:45.209 --> 20:49.441
...whether l wanted to be Joan of Arc,
Florence Nightingale or John L. Lewis.

20:49.529 --> 20:51.724
-What's the matter, you fed up?
-To the neck.

20:52.409 --> 20:55.845
Even with this million-dollar museum?
All those marble pillars down there?

20:55.929 --> 20:58.523
Case, compared to the life l lead...

20:58.609 --> 21:01.919
...the last man in a chain gang
thoroughly enjoys himself.

21:02.529 --> 21:06.681
What you need's some time off from
what you've been doing day in, day out.

21:06.769 --> 21:10.648
You mean from what l've not been doing
days in, please, years out.

21:12.089 --> 21:15.968
How does your garden grow, Case?
ls life wonderful where you are?

21:16.049 --> 21:16.845
lt can be.

21:16.929 --> 21:20.205
-But it hasn't been?
-l don't call what l've been doing ''living.''

21:20.449 --> 21:23.168
-What do you recommend for yourself?
-A holiday.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.240
-For how long?
-For as long as l need.

21:25.329 --> 21:28.526
-You mean just to play?
-No, l've been working since l was 10.

21:28.609 --> 21:30.486
l want to find out why l'm working.

21:30.569 --> 21:34.005
The answer can't be just to pay bills
or pile up more money.

21:34.089 --> 21:36.319
Even if you do,
the government takes most of it.

21:36.409 --> 21:39.606
-But what is the answer?
-That's what l intend to find out.

21:39.689 --> 21:43.079
The world is changing out there.
There's new exciting ideas running around.

21:43.169 --> 21:46.081
Some right, some cock-eyed,
but they are affecting our lives.

21:46.169 --> 21:49.718
l want to know how l stand, where l fit in,
what all this will mean to me.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.118
l can't find that out sitting behind a desk
in an office.

21:52.209 --> 21:54.643
l'm going to get money together,
and then knock off.

21:54.729 --> 21:56.208
-Quit?
-Quit.

21:56.529 --> 21:58.679
l want to save part of my life for myself.

21:58.769 --> 22:02.239
There's a catch to it though,
it's got to be part of the young part.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.365
You know, retire young and work old.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.838
Come back and work
when l know what l'm working for.

22:06.929 --> 22:10.239
-Does that make sense to you?
-That makes a lot of sense.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.684
-Does Julia know?
-No.

22:12.769 --> 22:14.999
l won't get her hopes up
until l get enough money.

22:15.089 --> 22:18.047
She has enough for two right now,
or for 10, for that matter.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.882
l don't want her dough.
l've got to earn it myself.

22:20.969 --> 22:22.118
That's foolish.

22:22.209 --> 22:26.088
You're all right, though.
You haven't been bitten or caught by it yet.

22:26.169 --> 22:28.888
-By what?
-The reverence for riches.

22:28.969 --> 22:31.278
-Look out for that, Johnny.
-No, not for me.

22:32.249 --> 22:35.286
-Who took the Scotch from my closet?
-What happened in church?

22:35.369 --> 22:39.521
-lt was in my riding boots, a full quart.
-Neddie, shut up. Did Julia tell Father?

22:40.049 --> 22:41.846
l haven't been up here in years.

22:41.929 --> 22:43.601
What did Father say?

22:44.049 --> 22:48.008
We left Father talking about that guy
to Mr. Hobson in front of church.

22:48.089 --> 22:49.966
-Who's the egg anyway?
-l'm the egg.

22:50.049 --> 22:52.688
And he's a good egg, too.
Johnny Case, my brother, Ned.

22:52.769 --> 22:54.122
How are you?

22:54.289 --> 22:56.598
Congratulations!
This place gives me the creeps.

22:56.689 --> 22:59.522
l've been telling Johnny
about some of our childhood dreams.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.408
Some dreams.

23:09.809 --> 23:10.798
lt's in tune.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.758
l thought you'd want to come back
and finish that concerto you were writing.

23:16.489 --> 23:18.445
The Seton Concerto in F Major.

23:19.089 --> 23:21.159
Come on, Neddie. Neddie, play it.

23:21.329 --> 23:24.127
Play it, Neddie. Johnny and l can bear it.
Can't we?

23:24.209 --> 23:26.245
You really want to hear it?

23:31.329 --> 23:32.887
Neddie, no.

23:32.969 --> 23:35.085
l've been boasting about you.

23:49.009 --> 23:50.920
Hello. What are you all doing up here?

23:51.129 --> 23:52.278
What a morning.

23:52.369 --> 23:54.803
-What did Father say?
-He isn't home yet.

23:55.489 --> 23:59.448
l want to know the minute Mr. Seton returns.
Buzz up here twice, will you? Thanks.

23:59.529 --> 24:02.999
-Was it terrible at church?
-Not so bad, but there's dirty weather ahead.

24:03.089 --> 24:04.158
Now you <i>....</i>

24:05.329 --> 24:10.119
-Johnny, you didn't change that tie.
-That's right, l didn't.

24:11.849 --> 24:14.568
Well, never mind, Ned can lend you one.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.680
l feel like a goat
being prepared for the sacrifice.

24:26.289 --> 24:27.517
Now, that's a sheep.

24:27.609 --> 24:28.837
What you need is a drink.

24:28.929 --> 24:31.397
-We'd better give him some coaching.
-l'd be grateful.

24:31.489 --> 24:33.878
Firstly, Father will want to know
how you're fixed.

24:33.969 --> 24:35.641
-Fixed?
-Money. How much?

24:35.729 --> 24:39.927
You wouldn't expect it of a man in Father's
position, but money is our God here.

24:40.009 --> 24:42.682
-Johnny, it isn't true at all.
-No? What is, then?

24:42.769 --> 24:43.884
Well, young man?

24:43.969 --> 24:47.644
Well, sir, at the moment
l have in my pocket exactly $34...

24:47.729 --> 24:50.846
...and a coupon for a Bank Night
at a Lake Placid movie.

24:50.929 --> 24:53.727
No gilt-edge securities,
no rolling woodlands?

24:53.809 --> 24:56.528
l have a few shares of common stock
tucked away in a warm--

24:56.609 --> 24:59.043
Common, don't say the word.
l'm afraid he won't do.

24:59.129 --> 25:02.917
He's a comely boy, but probably just
another of the vast army of clock-watchers.

25:03.009 --> 25:06.001
-How are you socially?
-Nothing much there either.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.557
Your mother wasn't even a whooziz?

25:08.649 --> 25:11.004
-Nope.
-Linda, l do wish you'd shut up.

25:11.089 --> 25:14.047
-Maybe he's got a judge in the family.
-Yes, that might help.

25:14.129 --> 25:17.565
Old Judge Case's boy.
White pillars, guitars a-strumming.

25:17.649 --> 25:20.686
-'Evening, Master.
-How you all, Miss Linda?

25:20.769 --> 25:24.444
-Know any prominent people? Drop names.
-Just casually, you know.

25:24.529 --> 25:29.080
At Mrs. Onderkonk's cockfight last Tuesday,
whom should l see but Mrs. Marble.

25:29.169 --> 25:31.205
-l thought we'd die laughing.
-Johnny, this is rot.

25:31.289 --> 25:32.961
''Johnny,'' she calls me <i>....</i>

25:33.049 --> 25:35.279
-Linda, will you be quiet?
-l'm having a swell time.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.688
This is terrible.

25:36.769 --> 25:40.444
Do you realize that you are trying
to marry into one of America's 60 families?

25:40.529 --> 25:43.123
When l find myself in a position
like this l ask myself...

25:43.209 --> 25:45.882
...what would General Motors do?
Then l do the opposite.

25:45.969 --> 25:48.199
As long as you don't do a back flip-flop.

25:48.289 --> 25:51.008
-Can you do a back flip-flop? Really?
-Sure.

25:51.089 --> 25:53.842
But, you'll have to teach me.
l can do almost anything else.

25:53.929 --> 25:57.399
lt'll be a pity if it doesn't come off,
it'll be a real pity.

25:58.129 --> 26:01.166
Yes, it'll be a pity
if this doesn't come off, too.

26:01.409 --> 26:02.842
Okay. Alley.

26:04.369 --> 26:06.519
lt's Father. He's home. Come on, Johnny.

26:06.609 --> 26:08.520
-What about the flip thing?
-No.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.282
Linda and l will go down and talk to him.
You go with Ned.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.564
-Why?
-You're not supposed to have arrived yet.

26:13.649 --> 26:15.207
-When do l arrive?
-1 :00.

26:15.289 --> 26:16.199
1 :00.

26:16.289 --> 26:19.087
And please change that tie.

26:19.889 --> 26:22.608
Ned will tell you exactly
when to put in an appearance.

26:22.689 --> 26:25.044
This is getting very complicated,
if you ask me.

26:25.129 --> 26:29.088
Nobody asked you. Now go on.
Do as you're told. Stop it.

26:29.649 --> 26:33.562
Go on, Case. Don't expect simplicity here.
Just think of Fifth Avenue frontage.

26:33.649 --> 26:35.367
Lend him a tie, Ned.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.001
-You do like him, don't you?
-She asks me if l like him.

26:40.089 --> 26:43.399
Dear girl, do you realize that life
walked into this house this morning?

26:43.489 --> 26:45.525
Darling, don't let him get away.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.520
lt'll be the same old story, of course.

26:47.609 --> 26:50.919
-l'm being married for my money.
-That's always flattering, isn't it?

26:51.009 --> 26:54.604
What's the use of all we've got
unless to get us a superior type of man?

26:54.689 --> 26:56.919
Linda, l hate you to talk like that.

26:57.009 --> 27:00.718
But, Julia, seriously he's like spring.
He's like a breath of fresh air.

27:00.809 --> 27:03.084
Do you know what he called this place?
A museum.

27:03.329 --> 27:05.399
Julia, here's your chance.

27:05.489 --> 27:06.524
That's just it.

27:06.609 --> 27:09.885
l want Father to see that Johnny
has the same qualities Grandfather had.

27:09.969 --> 27:11.197
You don't know Johnny.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.599
You don't know how far
he's come already and from what.

27:13.689 --> 27:15.759
-Or where he's going.
-l do.

27:15.849 --> 27:18.283
l know, l can see it as clear as day.

27:18.489 --> 27:22.562
lf it does go through all right,
when are you going to announce it?

27:22.649 --> 27:26.278
-Right away. Next Saturday.
-Darling, let me give a party for it.

27:26.369 --> 27:29.008
Now look,
Father is to have nothing to do with it.

27:29.089 --> 27:30.807
Saturday is New Year's Eve.

27:30.889 --> 27:33.687
Julia, let's have some fun
in this house before you leave it.

27:33.769 --> 27:37.125
-lf Father doesn't mind.
-No ifs at all. And just a few people.

27:37.209 --> 27:40.519
Just your friends and Johnny's
and up in the old playroom.

27:40.689 --> 27:42.759
Let me plan it. Let me give it.

27:42.849 --> 27:47.320
Let me do something for you once.
Me, Julia.

27:47.409 --> 27:49.479
l'd love it darling, really l would.

27:49.569 --> 27:52.720
No, but you see,
this is awfully important to me now.

27:52.809 --> 27:55.403
Now no one must touch my party but me,
do you hear?

27:55.489 --> 27:56.604
All right, darling.

27:56.689 --> 27:59.078
Now if they do, l won't come to it.

27:59.529 --> 28:00.598
Linda...

28:01.969 --> 28:03.766
...it'll be awful to leave you.

28:03.849 --> 28:07.524
Julia, l don't know what l'll do when you go.

28:08.409 --> 28:09.967
l've got to do something.

28:10.049 --> 28:14.600
l've got to get out, quit,
change on it somehow or l'll go mad.

28:15.409 --> 28:17.445
l could curl up and die right now.

28:18.889 --> 28:22.404
Why, my foot. l don't look sick, do l?

28:23.169 --> 28:24.887
You know, this is a museum.

28:25.049 --> 28:28.758
Never mind about me. l'll be all right.
Look out for yourself.

28:35.129 --> 28:36.926
Don't let him bully you.

28:38.489 --> 28:41.322
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Father.

28:43.649 --> 28:46.721
-Did you see Mr. Hobson, Father?
-Just for a moment.

28:46.809 --> 28:51.166
There's another thing to be considered.
What is the young man's background?

28:51.249 --> 28:52.602
What did Mr. Hobson say?

28:52.689 --> 28:55.567
But we mustn't rush into things, must we?

28:57.329 --> 29:01.117
l want to be married on January 10.
That's two weeks from this Tuesday.

29:01.209 --> 29:02.198
lmpossible.

29:02.289 --> 29:03.438
-Why?
-Yes, why?

29:03.529 --> 29:05.406
l won't stand for a long engagement.

29:05.489 --> 29:07.286
The boy has loads of charm, Father.

29:07.369 --> 29:09.724
-You know him?
-l've heard tell of him.

29:10.169 --> 29:10.965
Charm.

29:11.049 --> 29:14.485
l suppose it's solid merit you're after.
The rumour is he's got that, too.

29:14.569 --> 29:17.322
A sterling chap on the whole.
A catch, in fact.

29:17.409 --> 29:20.207
Have you the financial section
of the <i>Times</i>, Ned?

29:20.289 --> 29:23.008
No. l try to take Sundays off when l can.

29:23.529 --> 29:27.761
Which reminds me,
l'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00.

29:27.969 --> 29:31.120
-6:00? What for?
-As an example to the other men.

29:31.209 --> 29:34.963
-But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00.
-You'll find something.

29:35.049 --> 29:37.517
See here, Father,
if you think l'm going to fake--

29:37.609 --> 29:39.406
Did you understand me, Ned?

29:40.729 --> 29:43.323
Father, what did Mr. Hobson say?

29:43.409 --> 29:46.162
lt wasn't the time or place
to go into the matter with him.

29:46.249 --> 29:47.887
l asked him to drop by tonight.

29:48.089 --> 29:50.125
Father, but what did he say?

29:50.889 --> 29:55.121
His report was not at all unfavourable.

29:55.369 --> 29:58.520
-That must have been a blow.
-He appears to have some business ability.

29:58.609 --> 30:02.204
He has put through a successful
reorganization of Seaboard Utilities.

30:02.289 --> 30:05.884
-Seaboard? Poor fellow.
-Shrewd fellow, perhaps.

30:05.969 --> 30:08.483
Hobson says the signs
are not unfavourable for Seaboard.

30:08.569 --> 30:10.366
We'll buy some in the morning, Ned.

30:10.449 --> 30:13.122
But we must know more
about Mr. Chase's background.

30:13.209 --> 30:14.437
Case, Father.

30:14.529 --> 30:17.566
Let it go.
Chase has such a sweet banking sound.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.164
-Father, he's from Baltimore.
-Fine, old, pre-war stock, l imagine.

30:21.249 --> 30:24.286
Wasn't there a Judge Case somewhere?

30:24.409 --> 30:29.119
l intend to know more about the young man
than his name and his place of birth.

30:30.409 --> 30:33.401
lt would be advisable
that when he arrives he finds me alone...

30:33.489 --> 30:36.447
...in order that l may conduct the inquiry
along my own lines.

30:36.529 --> 30:40.647
l won't allow the subject of an engagement
to come up in my first talk with him.

30:40.729 --> 30:44.517
Wouldn't you like me to hide
under the sofa and take shorthand notes?

30:45.329 --> 30:47.206
l don't believe that'll be necessary.

30:47.289 --> 30:51.601
l think the poor guy ought to see
one friendly face in the courtroom.

30:51.689 --> 30:52.599
Yes, Henry?

30:52.689 --> 30:55.487
-Mr. Case wishes to be announced, sir.
-Yes, Henry.

30:55.889 --> 30:58.528
You will all excuse yourselves
on one pretext or another.

30:58.609 --> 31:02.397
Keep a stiff upper lip, Father.
No doubt the fellow is an impostor.

31:02.689 --> 31:04.964
-Father.
-Yes, Julia?

31:05.049 --> 31:07.688
Remember, l know what l want.

31:08.689 --> 31:09.724
Come in.

31:09.809 --> 31:12.084
l hope l'm not late. l got caught in traffic.

31:12.169 --> 31:13.443
Father, this is Mr. Case.

31:13.529 --> 31:15.326
-How do you do?
-How do you do, sir?

31:15.409 --> 31:16.364
My daughter Linda.

31:16.449 --> 31:17.723
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

31:17.809 --> 31:18.958
And my son, Edward.

31:19.049 --> 31:21.119
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

31:24.689 --> 31:28.443
Ned, if you and your sisters
will do the telephoning you spoke about...

31:28.529 --> 31:30.918
...l shall try and entertain Mr. Case.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.603
We'll be back in a few minutes, Johnny.

31:36.049 --> 31:38.609
What would we do without the telephone?

31:41.169 --> 31:44.366
l believe you had something
you wanted to do, Linda?

31:44.889 --> 31:46.208
Me, Father?

31:46.929 --> 31:48.840
l can't remember a thing.

31:52.169 --> 31:56.242
We seem to be enjoying quite
an unusual freedom from snow this winter.

31:57.009 --> 31:59.398
l like snow.
That's why l went up to Lake Placid.

31:59.489 --> 32:02.640
Placid? Yes, my daughter Julia
has just come from there.

32:02.729 --> 32:04.048
Yes, l know.

32:04.969 --> 32:09.087
-You're in business in New York, Mr. Case?
-Yes, sir. l'm with Sloan and Hobson.

32:09.169 --> 32:10.682
An excellent firm.

32:10.769 --> 32:13.841
-A born New Yorker?
-No, no. l was born in Baltimore.

32:13.929 --> 32:15.920
July 6, 1908. l'm 30.

32:16.009 --> 32:19.081
l used to have a lot of good friends
in Baltimore.

32:19.169 --> 32:22.844
Let me see.
The Whites, the Clarence Whites.

32:23.089 --> 32:26.206
-Possibly you knew them?
-l don't believe l ever did.

32:26.289 --> 32:30.123
-No? And there was Archer Fuller's family.
-l'm afraid not.

32:30.809 --> 32:34.404
Let me see, Colonel Evans, old Philip Evans.

32:34.529 --> 32:35.484
No.

32:36.129 --> 32:39.758
l haven't been there in some years and,
well, l wouldn't know them anyway.

32:39.849 --> 32:42.602
You see, my father
had a small grocery store in Baltimore.

32:43.449 --> 32:45.724
Yes. He never made a go of it though...

32:45.809 --> 32:49.518
...and when he died he left several debts
which Mother worked hard to clear up.

32:49.609 --> 32:52.919
l was just a child at the time
and l couldn't help her very much.

32:53.009 --> 32:55.239
Mother died the May
before my 16th birthday.

32:56.369 --> 32:57.358
How sad.

32:58.569 --> 32:59.968
Yes, it was pretty sad.

33:00.089 --> 33:02.205
l hadn't any connections
except for an uncle...

33:02.289 --> 33:04.280
...who's in the roofing business
in Wilmington.

33:04.369 --> 33:07.839
He wasn't much good, though.
He was inclined to get drunk. Still is.

33:08.049 --> 33:11.121
We have an uncle
like that but he keeps off roofs.

33:11.889 --> 33:14.528
Mother had wanted me
to go to a big Eastern college...

33:14.609 --> 33:17.567
...so l worked my way through Harvard.

33:17.649 --> 33:20.766
ln vacations, l worked in a steel mill
and in an automobile factory.

33:20.849 --> 33:22.805
One summer l drove a garbage truck.

33:23.649 --> 33:24.843
Admirable.

33:24.929 --> 33:27.921
No, they simply happened
to be the only jobs l could get...

33:28.009 --> 33:31.922
...but you can learn a lot in a steel mill,
a lot you don't get at Harvard.

33:32.689 --> 33:34.327
Anything else, sir?

33:35.169 --> 33:36.488
l beg your pardon?

33:36.569 --> 33:38.480
l should think you would.

33:39.929 --> 33:42.318
ls there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

33:42.409 --> 33:44.684
Why, that is <i>....</i>

33:45.289 --> 33:47.519
Well, Mr. Seton, how about it?

33:47.609 --> 33:51.318
-About it? About what?
-About Julia and me, getting married.

33:51.409 --> 33:53.798
Why, this is a complete surprise to me.

33:53.889 --> 33:56.323
l hardly know what to say to you.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.879
-Well, ''yes'' would be pleasant.
-l'm sure it would.

34:00.329 --> 34:04.242
However, we must go into the matter
a little more carefully, l'm afraid.

34:04.489 --> 34:09.040
The only difficulty about that is the time.
Julia's idea is January 10. Mine, too.

34:09.129 --> 34:10.960
We'll see about that.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.480
May l ask how we shall see, sir?

34:13.569 --> 34:16.527
Mr. Case, l don't know you at all.

34:17.129 --> 34:19.404
l'll give you every opportunity
you permit me.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.206
-Lunch tomorrow?
-Tomorrow l have--

34:21.289 --> 34:22.438
Tuesday?

34:22.929 --> 34:25.887
Suppose you meet me
at the Bankers' Club at 1 :00 on Friday?

34:25.969 --> 34:29.405
l'm sorry, but Friday's out.
l've got business in Boston that day.

34:29.489 --> 34:30.808
Better make it tomorrow.

34:30.889 --> 34:34.677
l'll see whether l can rearrange
my engagements.

34:35.529 --> 34:38.440
Ned, Julia, nearly time for lunch, isn't it?

34:38.649 --> 34:42.801
ln the meantime, l think Mr. Sloan or
Mr. Hobson might say a good word for me.

34:42.889 --> 34:47.440
l'm decent and civilized
and l love your daughter, which isn't hard.

34:47.529 --> 34:51.283
She seems to like me, too, and that's
about all that can be said for me...

34:51.369 --> 34:53.929
...except that we have a grand chance
of being happy.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.079
-So do l.
-Come on, Father, be an angel.

34:56.168 --> 34:58.729
The matter is too important
to be decided offhand.

34:58.929 --> 35:02.842
You'll be married when l've come to
a decision and on a day which l will name.

35:02.929 --> 35:05.397
-Our plan was the 10th.
-That is out of the question.

35:05.489 --> 35:08.561
-Yes, Henry?
-Luncheon, sir.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.083
-Mr. Seton, l--
-Luncheon, Mr. Chase.

35:14.929 --> 35:17.762
A very interesting necktie you have.

35:18.169 --> 35:19.443
Thank you.

35:25.409 --> 35:29.118
l have a haberdasher
who's made my ties for a good many years...

35:29.209 --> 35:32.804
...and that particular pattern
l seem to recognize.

35:33.689 --> 35:36.761
Possibly, sir,
because this happens to be your necktie.

35:36.849 --> 35:39.079
Ned and l thought it might bring me luck.

35:49.289 --> 35:50.278
Father.

35:50.369 --> 35:52.087
Come in, Julia.

35:57.009 --> 35:58.886
l thought you might like
some hot chocolate.

35:58.969 --> 35:59.958
Thank you.

36:01.209 --> 36:03.200
l just saw Mr. Hobson leave.

36:03.289 --> 36:05.849
-Did you and he have a nice talk?
-Yes.

36:07.329 --> 36:08.682
Father...

36:09.649 --> 36:11.287
...what have you decided?

36:12.249 --> 36:15.605
Marriage is an extremely important step
for a young girl.

36:15.689 --> 36:18.044
Mother was younger than l
when she married you.

36:18.129 --> 36:22.759
ln marrying me, your mother and her family
took no risk, either financially...

36:22.849 --> 36:24.646
...or, if l may say so, spiritually.

36:24.729 --> 36:27.926
-Johnny will do well financially.
-No doubt about it.

36:28.009 --> 36:31.843
-Hobson tells me he has great possibilities.
-l know it.

36:32.169 --> 36:33.841
Then it's all right?

36:36.849 --> 36:39.363
-Do you see that cigar?
-Yes, Father.

36:39.449 --> 36:42.327
That's a brand of cigar
l've smoked for 35 years.

36:43.049 --> 36:45.483
Your grandfather smoked the same brand.

36:45.569 --> 36:50.404
l know the quality of tobacco in it because
l own the plantation where it was grown...

36:50.769 --> 36:55.445
...and l know therefore that when l light it,
it will burn smoothly and pleasantly.

36:56.089 --> 36:59.764
And l know above everything else
that it will never explode in my face.

36:59.849 --> 37:02.044
And you're afraid that Johnny might?

37:02.129 --> 37:05.644
There's a strange new spirit at work
in the world today...

37:05.729 --> 37:09.358
...a spirit of revolt.
l don't understand it and l don't like it.

37:09.449 --> 37:13.044
Don't worry about Johnny.
l know him better than you.

37:13.929 --> 37:18.719
My dear, l've never denied you anything
that was in my power to give.

37:18.849 --> 37:22.159
He'll burn, Father,
calmly, steadily, pleasantly.

37:24.129 --> 37:26.643
lt's only of you and your happiness
l'm thinking.

37:26.809 --> 37:27.764
Father...

37:29.049 --> 37:30.402
...you can trust me.

37:30.569 --> 37:32.480
l'll take care of myself.

37:34.449 --> 37:36.246
Thank you, Father.

37:37.209 --> 37:40.087
-Can we announce it New Year's Eve?
-l shall arrange a party.

37:40.169 --> 37:41.602
How wonderful!

37:44.129 --> 37:47.599
Linda had said something
about wanting to give a party herself.

37:48.249 --> 37:49.921
One of those ideas of hers.

37:50.009 --> 37:53.968
l think by now you and l know
how to take care of those ideas of Linda's.

37:55.009 --> 37:58.558
-lt was awfully sweet of her.
-Linda has many generous impulses.

37:58.649 --> 37:59.764
Father?

38:00.129 --> 38:01.562
Come in, Linda.

38:04.329 --> 38:05.603
ls it yes?

38:06.929 --> 38:08.760
Father, l knew you'd do it.

38:08.849 --> 38:12.603
-Be careful, you'll put my cigar out.
-What's a cigar on a night like this?

38:12.689 --> 38:15.522
Darling, l'm so glad. Have you told Johnny?

38:15.609 --> 38:18.043
-l haven't had time.
-Telephone him right away.

38:19.409 --> 38:22.481
Well, then let's ring bells.
Let's send up skyrockets.

38:23.129 --> 38:25.563
Let's turn on all the lights in the house.

38:27.049 --> 38:29.643
Father, aren't you proud of yourself?

38:31.049 --> 38:33.483
Gee, this would have made Mother happy.

38:33.569 --> 38:35.207
Mother, you'd love him.

38:36.729 --> 38:39.687
Don't forget l'm to give the party
to announce the engagement.

38:39.769 --> 38:43.398
l've got it all planned. Just a few people,
Johnny's friends and Julia's...

38:43.489 --> 38:45.241
...and up in the old playroom.

38:45.329 --> 38:48.480
No formalities, no white ties,
no engraved invitations.

38:59.849 --> 39:01.123
l like your tie, too.

39:01.209 --> 39:04.440
-By the way, where's Linda?
-She'll be down soon. l'm sure she will.

39:04.529 --> 39:07.726
-She just hates big parties.
-But not this one?

39:07.809 --> 39:11.882
Johnny, look at Father.
He's just seething with excitement.

39:17.129 --> 39:19.359
You've won his heart completely.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.163
-He's been awfully nice to me.
-Father's such a dear.

39:22.249 --> 39:24.843
He made all the arrangements
for the party himself.

39:24.929 --> 39:26.601
ls that the fellow?

39:28.329 --> 39:30.718
He's rather good-looking at least.

39:30.809 --> 39:33.403
-Hello, Uncle Edward.
-Good evening.

39:33.489 --> 39:35.366
-Seton.
-Good evening, Uncle Edward.

39:36.209 --> 39:38.598
There's Laura and Seton Cram.
He's my cousin.

39:39.369 --> 39:43.362
Darling, tell me, when are you to announce
the exciting news about Julia?

39:43.449 --> 39:45.440
Shortly after midnight as a surprise.

39:45.529 --> 39:48.407
Well, Julia seems divinely happy.

39:48.769 --> 39:51.761
What does Linda say? You know,
we haven't seen Linda all evening.

39:51.849 --> 39:56.445
Linda has been somewhat indisposed.
lf asked, please explain she has a headache.

39:56.529 --> 39:58.724
Yes, of course, Linda's headaches.

39:58.809 --> 40:01.721
Now, don't worry, darling,
we understand perfectly.

40:01.809 --> 40:04.323
She shall come down
before the announcement.

40:04.409 --> 40:05.603
Of course.

40:05.689 --> 40:08.726
Now don't worry, darling,
you just leave everything to us, will you?

40:09.289 --> 40:10.802
lt's a lovely party.

40:11.729 --> 40:13.879
Now what's the matter with Linda?

40:13.969 --> 40:16.244
Hello, Dorothy, you look lovely.

40:17.129 --> 40:20.804
-Dear, where'd she get that horrible dress?
-Uncle Edward is worried, isn't he?

40:20.889 --> 40:22.402
-Hello, Bunny.
-Hello, Seton.

40:22.489 --> 40:25.128
l'd be worried, too,
if l had children like Ned and Linda.

40:25.209 --> 40:28.918
Now he takes an utter stranger
into the family. l don't approve of it at all.

40:29.009 --> 40:33.161
lf Linda had done it l could understand,
but for Julia to take an unknown climber <i>....</i>

40:33.249 --> 40:34.602
Mother's furious about it.

40:34.689 --> 40:37.123
He's obviously after Julia's money.

40:37.209 --> 40:38.244
Hello, Countess.

40:38.329 --> 40:40.718
He doesn't even belong to the Harvard Club.

40:42.569 --> 40:44.958
Julia, darling, you look lovely.

40:45.049 --> 40:46.482
-Hello, Laura.
-Thank you, dear.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.847
-Hello, Seton.
-l'm Cousin Laura and l'm so happy about it.

40:51.089 --> 40:53.762
My dear, he is attractive, isn't he?

40:53.929 --> 40:56.568
This is my husband, Seton Cram.
He's Julia's cousin.

40:56.649 --> 40:59.482
-l married into the family.
-Not a bad family to marry into.

40:59.569 --> 41:00.638
Congratulations.

41:00.729 --> 41:04.005
-Thank you, Mr. Cram.
-Don't ''Mister'' him. We grew up together.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.557
We've heard such wonderful things
about you.

41:06.649 --> 41:10.403
-Have you? From whom?
-Well, from everybody.

41:11.089 --> 41:14.001
My dear, it's such a shame about Linda.

41:14.169 --> 41:17.684
She does have such frightful luck
with those headaches of hers, doesn't she?

41:17.769 --> 41:18.565
Yes.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.165
There's Ned. We've been looking for him.
Come on. We'll see you later.

41:22.249 --> 41:24.319
-Good-bye, Johnny.
-See you later, Johnny.

41:32.929 --> 41:35.238
Ned, did you speak to Linda?

41:35.569 --> 41:39.323
How do you like Seton and Laura? lt's
a privilege to meet them, don't you think?

41:39.409 --> 41:40.637
What did Linda say?

41:40.729 --> 41:41.923
Cheer up, Johnny.

41:42.009 --> 41:45.365
lf you find Seton and Laura dull,
wait until you meet some of the others.

41:45.449 --> 41:49.488
The more you find out about us Setons,
the more impressive we become.

41:49.569 --> 41:53.767
Father wanted a big family, you know.
Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him.

41:53.849 --> 41:58.286
Linda was a girl, so she promptly had Julia.
Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless.

41:58.369 --> 42:01.964
The next year Mother had me
and there was much joy in the land.

42:02.169 --> 42:05.445
lt was a boy
and the fair name of Seton would flourish.

42:05.529 --> 42:10.159
lt must have been a consolation to Father.
He must have been very grateful to Mother.

42:10.569 --> 42:11.968
Drink to Mother, Johnny.

42:12.049 --> 42:15.325
She tried to be a Seton for a while,
then gave up and died.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.877
You're talking through your hat, Ned.

42:18.089 --> 42:19.807
But, l'm not.

42:20.129 --> 42:22.006
Ned, what did Linda say?

42:22.169 --> 42:25.002
-She's coming down, isn't she?
-Don't make me laugh, Sister.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.723
-What's all this about Linda?
-lt's nothing, Johnny.

42:27.809 --> 42:30.403
That's right. lt's nothing.
Just one of Linda's whims.

42:30.489 --> 42:33.128
The silly little girl
wanted to give her kind of a party.

42:33.209 --> 42:37.805
Between you and Father you've changed
her shindig into a first-class funeral.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.928
She should've realized Father couldn't
announce my engagement without a fuss.

42:42.009 --> 42:45.445
She should have, yes,
but unlike me, Linda always hopes.

42:45.529 --> 42:46.928
Bottoms up to Linda.

42:47.009 --> 42:50.285
Ned, please,
you've been drinking steadily since 8:00.

42:50.369 --> 42:53.759
Yes, funny old Ned.
On New Year's Eve, too.

42:53.849 --> 42:55.362
Johnny, try to stop him.

42:55.449 --> 42:59.044
l shall drink as much as l like
at any party l agree to attend.

42:59.129 --> 43:01.927
And as much as l like
is as much as l can hold.

43:02.129 --> 43:04.279
lt's my protection
against your tiresome friends.

43:04.369 --> 43:06.564
Linda's out of luck.
She hasn't any protection.

43:06.929 --> 43:08.885
Robert, another highball, please.

43:09.049 --> 43:11.768
Ned, take it easy.

43:14.209 --> 43:15.642
Aye, aye, sir.

43:32.369 --> 43:35.441
-The name, sir?
-The name is Professor Nicholas Potter.

43:35.529 --> 43:37.042
And wife Susan.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.047
We were invited.

43:40.129 --> 43:43.360
The ladies' cloakroom
is the second door to the left, madam.

43:43.449 --> 43:44.723
Thank you.

44:05.449 --> 44:07.201
-Hello, Mr. Thayer.
-Well.

44:07.689 --> 44:10.328
-lt's getting near the New Year.
-That's right, sir.

44:10.449 --> 44:13.725
-lt lacks about an hour, l should say.
-An hour and 38 minutes, Edgar.

44:13.809 --> 44:15.242
Thank you, sir.

44:15.889 --> 44:19.120
-The elevator is to the rear and right.
-Would it be too much--

44:19.209 --> 44:20.608
Hello, Mr. Jennings.

44:20.889 --> 44:24.279
-Coming close to the New Year now.
-One hour and 27 minutes, Edgar.

44:25.769 --> 44:27.964
-He's fast.
-Yes, sir.

44:28.049 --> 44:30.563
The elevator is to the rear and right.

44:30.729 --> 44:33.687
-Thank you, but you have my shoe.
-l beg your pardon.

44:33.769 --> 44:35.407
lt's quite all right.

44:35.649 --> 44:37.765
A very natural mistake, as a matter of fact.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.282
Thank you. l'll do it.

44:42.849 --> 44:45.283
Don't tell anyone,
but l've got a run in my stocking.

44:45.369 --> 44:46.848
Good heavens, we're ruined.

44:47.009 --> 44:49.921
-Not a word of this to a soul.
-No, sir. The elevator <i>....</i>

44:50.009 --> 44:52.079
ls to the rear and to the right.

44:59.569 --> 45:00.968
l'm sorry.

45:02.329 --> 45:06.641
-Perhaps we'd better use the elevator.
-To the rear and to the right.

45:06.769 --> 45:08.361
l think we'd better go home.

45:08.449 --> 45:12.237
Courage, dear, courage. Remember,
we promised Johnny that we'd come.

45:12.609 --> 45:15.521
This reminds me a little
of the palace of the Emperor Caligula.

45:15.609 --> 45:18.169
-You remember Caligula, don't you?
-Very well, indeed.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.080
Whatever became of him?

45:22.689 --> 45:25.567
-To the rear <i>....</i>
-And to the right.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.477
Now where?

46:09.289 --> 46:12.087
Seems to have been
some sort of a residence at one time.

46:23.649 --> 46:25.879
lt's the Gashouse Gang, darling.

46:33.649 --> 46:35.446
The party's downstairs.

46:35.729 --> 46:36.957
Thank you.

46:37.049 --> 46:38.607
Sorry to intrude.

46:40.889 --> 46:41.844
No.

46:42.009 --> 46:43.283
Wait a minute.

46:45.169 --> 46:46.648
-You're Susan Elliott?
-Yes.

46:46.729 --> 46:48.128
My married name is Potter.

46:48.209 --> 46:51.121
No, but you lectured once at our school.
l'm Linda Seton.

46:51.249 --> 46:52.477
-You're not.
-Yes.

46:52.569 --> 46:55.288
-Johnny said her name was Julia.
-Julia's my sister.

46:55.369 --> 46:57.280
-You know Johnny?
-For years.

46:57.369 --> 46:59.883
l'm so glad to see you. Come in.

47:01.849 --> 47:04.727
-Who's that?
-That is my husband, Nick Potter.

47:04.809 --> 47:07.403
You can come in, too. Close the door.

47:09.609 --> 47:10.724
Who lives here?

47:10.809 --> 47:11.924
l live here.

47:12.009 --> 47:14.000
l live here, in a manner of speaking.

47:14.729 --> 47:15.923
l see.

47:16.049 --> 47:19.678
You wouldn't eat your oatmeal this morning,
so they won't let you go to the party?

47:19.769 --> 47:23.045
l'm the mad sister, the family problem.
The one they don't speak about.

47:23.129 --> 47:25.484
-Yes, so was l.
-You see what happened to her.

47:25.569 --> 47:27.241
-What?
-She had to marry me.

47:27.329 --> 47:29.718
A professor without a cent of money.

47:29.809 --> 47:32.562
So you'd better be a good little girl
and eat your porridge.

47:32.649 --> 47:34.685
-Sit down, will you?
-Thank you.

47:34.769 --> 47:38.682
-My, it's good to be home again.
-Yes, we've had quite a long walk.

47:38.929 --> 47:41.602
-This is a shame, it really is.
-Why?

47:41.689 --> 47:44.442
l was going to give a party tonight.
l had it all planned.

47:44.529 --> 47:45.962
l was going to <i>....</i>

47:46.329 --> 47:49.162
Well, it was a good idea.
lt might have been fun.

47:49.809 --> 47:52.562
-Your sister, Julia.
-ls she anything like you?

47:53.129 --> 47:55.518
Don't worry, she's not at all like me.

47:55.929 --> 47:57.601
-Haven't you met her yet?
-No.

47:57.689 --> 47:59.600
You must. Johnny'll be glad to see you.

47:59.689 --> 48:02.840
-But you must. lt'll spoil Johnny's party.
-Definitely no.

48:03.249 --> 48:04.762
Definitely no.

48:12.009 --> 48:13.488
My brother, Ned.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.805
l thought
you might want a little cheering up.

48:19.889 --> 48:21.880
Ned, how sweet of you, how really sweet.

48:21.969 --> 48:25.006
l'm a sweet kid. Take this back
to the orchestra leader, please.

48:25.089 --> 48:27.842
My brother, Ned, Mr. and Mrs. Potter.
Friends of Johnny's.

48:27.929 --> 48:29.203
He used to live with us.

48:29.289 --> 48:32.998
We've come to warn his future bride. He
never puts the cap back on the toothpaste.

48:33.089 --> 48:34.920
Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny.

48:35.009 --> 48:36.362
He needs it.

48:36.489 --> 48:37.683
Needs it?

48:38.449 --> 48:41.998
No, l'm wrong. He doesn't need it.
Johnny's doing all right.

48:42.089 --> 48:44.887
-What's on your mind, Ned?
-Nothing's on my mind.

48:44.969 --> 48:46.925
What do you mean,
''Johnny's doing all right?''

48:47.009 --> 48:48.727
l mean he's doing all right.

48:48.969 --> 48:50.288
He's having a whirl.

48:50.369 --> 48:54.157
His hair's slicked down and Father's seeing
that he meets the important people.

48:54.249 --> 48:56.524
My word,
are there important people downstairs?

48:56.609 --> 49:00.488
Frightfully important.
That's why l wanted to give a party up here.

49:00.569 --> 49:05.120
Miss Seton on New Year's Eve entertained
a group of very unimportant people.

49:05.209 --> 49:06.688
To our hostess.

49:07.209 --> 49:08.722
May l drink, too?

49:13.009 --> 49:16.763
Believe it or not, l've just been learning
how much it costs to keep up a yacht.

49:16.849 --> 49:19.522
-What's the matter?
-Father sent for me. lt's about Linda.

49:19.609 --> 49:22.077
Everybody has begun to talk
about her not being here.

49:22.169 --> 49:25.241
-She's simply got to come down.
-Got to?

49:25.329 --> 49:27.889
Go up to the playroom
and make her come down now.

49:27.969 --> 49:29.925
-l'll ask her.
-lnsist on it.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.728
l'll do what a gentleman can do
under the circumstances.

49:50.369 --> 49:53.042
-That's good. Was that good?
-No!

49:53.369 --> 49:54.518
Yeah, marvellous.

49:54.609 --> 49:56.361
-Unless l'm getting drunk.
-No.

49:56.449 --> 49:58.724
lt's the first champagne
l've had since l was 4.

49:58.969 --> 49:59.958
Not really?

50:01.649 --> 50:04.766
-Do you mind if l play with your toys?
-l think you'd better.

50:04.849 --> 50:06.919
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

50:08.369 --> 50:09.688
He's grand.

50:09.769 --> 50:13.557
-Has Johnny any other friends like him?
-There aren't many people like Nick.

50:13.649 --> 50:15.844
Or like Johnny either, for that matter.

50:16.289 --> 50:20.441
-We've had wonderful times, we three.
-You'll have a lot more fun with Julia.

50:20.529 --> 50:25.159
You must let Ned and me be guest members
of the Johnny, Julia, Nick and Susan Club.

50:25.249 --> 50:27.843
Look what l've found.
Come on, let's do <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

50:27.929 --> 50:29.806
''What light
through yonder window breaks?''

50:32.329 --> 50:35.605
-We used to put on shows for the kids.
-Did you?

50:36.889 --> 50:39.244
-This is a lovely one.
-Do one for us. Go ahead.

50:39.329 --> 50:40.478
Come on, Neddie.

50:40.729 --> 50:44.563
lt's all complete, including the characters.
You remember any of the lines?

50:45.289 --> 50:46.119
Linda.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.767
Johnny, come in.

50:50.489 --> 50:53.606
-l have a message for you.
-And l have a message for you.

50:53.689 --> 50:57.443
l have the honour to inform you
that your presence is requested downstairs.

50:58.209 --> 51:01.918
l have the honour to inform you
that your presence is requested right here.

51:02.009 --> 51:04.000
-There's a meeting of the club.
-Your club.

51:04.089 --> 51:05.841
No. Come on, the party needs you.

51:05.969 --> 51:08.403
Now's the time
to come to the aid of the party.

51:08.489 --> 51:10.286
But your father is really upset.

51:10.369 --> 51:12.644
Why, you don't tell me.
What seems to be the matter?

51:12.729 --> 51:16.563
Everybody has begun to notice you're not
there and it's embarrassing the family.

51:16.649 --> 51:17.923
The <i>....</i> Johnny--

51:18.569 --> 51:21.845
Linda, be a good sport now.
lt will make your father awfully happy.

51:21.929 --> 51:25.126
Would it make him any happier
if l crawled in on my hands and knees?

51:26.929 --> 51:28.806
That's telling him.

51:28.889 --> 51:30.163
Oh, my.

51:32.049 --> 51:33.767
-That's not Johnny.
-No?

51:33.849 --> 51:36.363
-Who is it?
-That's a very important person.

51:36.449 --> 51:38.280
Hello, important person.

51:38.449 --> 51:39.564
Don't be fresh.

51:40.569 --> 51:43.208
-Treat important persons with respect.
-l won't.

51:43.289 --> 51:46.804
-Hello, important person.
-Yeah? Take your place.

51:47.529 --> 51:48.928
What is this?

51:49.409 --> 51:51.286
lt's the voice of experience.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.008
Nick and Susan!

51:56.569 --> 51:58.480
Sir, that lady is my wife.

51:58.569 --> 52:00.127
Nick, thank goodness you came.

52:00.209 --> 52:01.722
The face is familiar. But <i>....</i>

52:03.449 --> 52:06.009
Do we know anyone who smells of violet?

52:14.049 --> 52:16.961
-How's that, you dog.
-No. lt can't be. lt's Johnny Case.

52:17.049 --> 52:18.118
You remember him.

52:18.209 --> 52:20.564
John Case, the rail-splitter,
friend of the people.

52:20.649 --> 52:21.764
Yes.

52:21.849 --> 52:25.205
-Well, we're glad to have you back.
-Back?

52:28.649 --> 52:30.879
You mean the marble pillars got me.

52:30.969 --> 52:32.641
l'm ready. l'll go quietly.

52:32.729 --> 52:34.242
Don't spare him, boys.

52:34.329 --> 52:35.284
There.

52:39.729 --> 52:42.368
-Now that you've got that off my mind.
-Never forget it.

52:42.449 --> 52:44.246
There's something l want you to know.

52:44.329 --> 52:46.399
-That deal l mentioned?
-The Seaboard thing?

52:46.489 --> 52:48.605
-l think it'll go through.
-You don't mean it?

52:48.689 --> 52:53.365
There's a very fair chance that l'll be able
to quit business next Saturday.

52:54.609 --> 52:56.361
So that you can go on the holiday?

52:56.449 --> 52:58.565
Sure, Johnny's Declaration
of lndependence.

52:58.649 --> 53:01.800
lt's all according to what a Boston crowd
called Bay State Power does.

53:01.889 --> 53:04.403
-Maybe they've done it already.
-They'll do it!

53:04.489 --> 53:07.526
-Then let's drink to Bay State Power.
-No, let's drink to Julia.

53:07.609 --> 53:08.962
-Have you met her yet?
-No.

53:09.049 --> 53:11.085
lf she's anything like her sister <i>....</i>

53:11.169 --> 53:15.640
No, we'll drink to Johnny and Julia and
Bay State Power, love and happiness and <i>....</i>

53:16.049 --> 53:17.960
Here you are.

53:18.049 --> 53:21.041
For the love of Pete,
it's The Witch and Dopey.

53:29.769 --> 53:33.125
l've never been up here before.
lt's awfully quaint, isn't it?

53:33.209 --> 53:34.528
We like it.

53:35.129 --> 53:39.247
Linda, are you aware that there's
another party going on in this house?

53:39.369 --> 53:41.929
You mean
that low-class dancehall downstairs?

53:42.009 --> 53:43.601
Don't speak of it.

53:45.009 --> 53:49.127
Excuse me, these are my friends. Professor
and Mrs. Potter, Mr. and Mrs. Cram.

53:49.209 --> 53:50.642
How do you do?

53:53.329 --> 53:54.842
You old fox, you.

53:55.049 --> 53:55.845
Fox?

53:55.929 --> 53:59.046
Sam Hobson's been telling me
about your little haul in Seaboard.

53:59.129 --> 54:01.199
You might have let us in the family in on it.

54:01.289 --> 54:03.678
-There's still time.
-Not the way that stock's acting.

54:03.769 --> 54:06.044
We have an order to buy 60,000 shares...

54:06.129 --> 54:08.359
...for Ross of Bay State Power
all the way up to 30.

54:08.449 --> 54:10.485
-Are you sure of that?
-l took the order myself.

54:10.569 --> 54:11.524
That cinches it.

54:11.609 --> 54:13.042
-ls that it?
-Just about.

54:13.129 --> 54:14.562
Good for you.

54:14.649 --> 54:16.082
Come on!

54:16.689 --> 54:18.168
Good for you.

54:18.609 --> 54:20.884
Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday.

54:20.969 --> 54:23.039
l think l could help you double your yield.

54:23.129 --> 54:26.087
My dad made me promise
to quit after my first million.

54:26.849 --> 54:28.760
You're probably joking, Professor.

54:28.849 --> 54:30.999
With the help of the right people
in Wall Street...

54:31.089 --> 54:32.966
...you'll make more within two years.

54:33.049 --> 54:36.041
lt wouldn't take that long
if we had the right kind of government.

54:36.129 --> 54:40.839
-Like which country for example, Mr. Cram?
-Now no political arguments.

54:40.929 --> 54:44.160
-Let's go downstairs and celebrate.
-Yes, this is a wonderful party.

54:44.249 --> 54:46.888
-l'm not going downstairs.
-Come on, don't be foolish.

54:46.969 --> 54:50.564
-But, Linda, your father said--
-l thought so but l'm not going downstairs.

54:50.729 --> 54:54.642
-Of course if--
-l wouldn't keep anyone who wants to.

54:54.729 --> 54:57.721
lf you ask me, this is the worst case
of downright rudeness l've seen.

54:57.809 --> 54:59.447
And has someone asked you?

54:59.969 --> 55:01.925
Come, dear, we can discuss this later.

55:02.009 --> 55:06.082
You wouldn't care to swing on the trapeze
and discuss it now, would you, Seton?

55:07.009 --> 55:10.240
We shall see you later, Mrs. Porter.
Professor Porter.

55:11.329 --> 55:13.479
l thought our name was Potter.

55:13.569 --> 55:14.968
l must be wrong.

55:22.929 --> 55:26.365
ln appreciation of your great success
in the fields of love and finance...

55:26.449 --> 55:29.168
...l wish to congratulate you
on behalf of the members...

55:29.249 --> 55:32.525
...of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt
and Flying Trapeze Club.

55:32.609 --> 55:37.444
And present you, my dear boy, with
this token of their affection and esteem.

55:37.889 --> 55:39.527
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

55:39.609 --> 55:41.565
Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen.

55:41.649 --> 55:43.162
My friends.

55:43.329 --> 55:46.446
l am not much of a speechmaker,
so l hardly know how to thank you.

55:46.529 --> 55:50.761
This young lady and myself have been
practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill...

55:50.849 --> 55:53.727
...with which
we shall be glad to entertain you.

56:00.809 --> 56:01.764
Alley.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.161
-Ready?
-Ready.

56:09.249 --> 56:10.648
Put on the lights.

56:10.729 --> 56:12.003
<i>Uno momento.</i>

56:12.089 --> 56:14.000
-Alley.
-Oop.

56:17.649 --> 56:18.764
Linda.

56:21.049 --> 56:22.368
The club is adjourned.

56:22.449 --> 56:24.519
Julia, l've got a grand surprise for you.

56:24.609 --> 56:27.407
Just a moment. Come down now.
lt's nearly 1 2:00...

56:27.489 --> 56:30.401
...and we want the entire party together
to see the New Year in.

56:30.489 --> 56:32.081
The New Year comes into this room, too.

56:32.169 --> 56:33.727
You've caused enough trouble.

56:33.809 --> 56:37.643
Father, if l want to see the New Year in
as l had planned, as l had asked you--

56:37.729 --> 56:42.120
l think if you don't mind we'll go down
and see what's happened to the furnace.

56:42.209 --> 56:44.518
Julia, this is Nick and Susan.
l told you about them.

56:44.609 --> 56:45.644
How do you do?

56:45.729 --> 56:49.881
-And Mr. Seton.
-Your friends are always welcome here.

56:49.969 --> 56:51.641
l'll see you downstairs.

56:51.729 --> 56:56.200
Thank you, but as a matter of fact
Susan has an awful run in her stocking.

56:56.289 --> 56:59.042
Why don't you go down to my room?
lt's on the third floor.

56:59.649 --> 57:00.684
Fine.

57:01.609 --> 57:03.839
Congratulations on your engagement,
Miss Seton.

57:03.929 --> 57:07.524
You're not getting very much,
but l'm sure you can improve him.

57:15.849 --> 57:19.159
Kindly walk, do not run to the nearest exit.

57:21.409 --> 57:22.888
They're grand people.

57:22.969 --> 57:26.086
-They'll wait, don't you think?
-l don't know. l don't know.

57:29.329 --> 57:31.126
There's no cause for temper, child.

57:31.209 --> 57:34.884
Run along and we'll follow. Julia and l
want to talk to Johnny for a moment.

57:34.969 --> 57:37.722
Listen to me, Father,
tonight means a good deal to me.

57:37.809 --> 57:40.164
l don't know what or how precisely.

57:40.249 --> 57:42.968
Something's trying to take it away
and l can't let it go.

57:43.049 --> 57:47.042
l'll put in an appearance downstairs. Then
l want to bring those people back here.

57:47.129 --> 57:48.847
l want to sit and have supper with them.

57:48.929 --> 57:51.966
We won't disturb anyone.
That's all right with you, isn't it?

57:52.049 --> 57:53.687
Your place is downstairs.

57:53.769 --> 57:55.760
Once more, this is important to me.

57:55.849 --> 57:58.647
Don't ask me why.
lt has something to do with this room...

57:58.729 --> 58:00.879
...when l was a child and good times in it.

58:00.969 --> 58:03.563
What special virtue this room has
l'm sure l don't know.

58:03.649 --> 58:06.038
You don't, do you? No, you can't.

58:06.129 --> 58:11.123
l'll tell you, this room's my home,
it's the only home l've got.

58:11.489 --> 58:15.323
There's something here that l understand
and that understands me.

58:15.489 --> 58:18.049
-Maybe it's Mother.
-Don't talk nonsense. Do as l say.

58:18.129 --> 58:21.280
You thought l'd come around.
You always think people will come around.

58:21.369 --> 58:22.722
Not me, not tonight.

58:22.809 --> 58:26.597
And l shan't be disturbed either 'cause
if there's one thing you hate, it's a scene.

58:26.689 --> 58:30.648
l can promise you one if you interfere.
l can promise you a beauty.

58:30.809 --> 58:32.765
Johnny, so there's good news, is there?

58:32.849 --> 58:34.441
Was Mother a sweet soul, Father?

58:34.529 --> 58:37.726
Linda, if you're not happy here
why don't you go away?

58:37.809 --> 58:40.528
l'll be glad if next month
you take a maid and a companion...

58:40.609 --> 58:42.122
...and take a trip somewhere.

58:42.209 --> 58:44.803
You distress me.
You cause nothing but trouble and upsets.

58:44.889 --> 58:46.880
That's just what l'm going to do.

58:46.969 --> 58:50.757
-No maid and no companion. Just me.
-As you wish.

58:50.849 --> 58:54.364
l've been dying to get out for years.
l've never known it so well as tonight.

58:54.649 --> 58:58.688
l can't stand it here any longer.
lt's doing terrible things to me.

59:00.009 --> 59:02.204
And now will you leave this room, please?

59:02.289 --> 59:03.358
This room.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.164
This room.

59:08.609 --> 59:12.443
l don't think you'll be able to stand it long.
l'll come back when you've left it.

59:16.969 --> 59:22.123
l don't believe l need to worry about
the way you'll take care of Julia, need l?

59:23.129 --> 59:25.040
We'll try to manage, thanks, sir.

59:25.249 --> 59:28.958
Seton has told us of your very successful
manipulations of Seaboard.

59:29.049 --> 59:31.961
l consider that a very fine piece of work.
l congratulate you.

59:32.049 --> 59:34.609
lsn't it marvellous? What a New Year.

59:34.689 --> 59:38.887
When you return from your honeymoon
if l'm not much mistaken...

59:39.009 --> 59:41.728
...there'll be a desk waiting for you
at the bank.

59:43.609 --> 59:45.486
That's very kind of you, sir...

59:45.609 --> 59:49.648
...but the success of the Seaboard deal
makes possible a certain plan of my own.

59:49.769 --> 59:50.838
But, Johnny <i>....</i>

59:50.969 --> 59:52.368
A plan? Yes?

59:53.409 --> 59:57.766
l'm afraid l'm not quite as anxious as l might
be for the things most people work towards.

59:57.849 --> 59:59.407
l don't want too much money.

59:59.489 --> 01:00:02.401
-Too much money?
-Well, more than l need to live by.

01:00:02.489 --> 01:00:05.322
lt's been my idea
to make a few thousands early in the game...

01:00:05.409 --> 01:00:09.482
...and then quit for as long as it lasts and
try to find out who l am and what goes on...

01:00:09.569 --> 01:00:12.163
...now, while l'm young
and feel good all the time.

01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:16.361
l'm sure Julia understands
what l'm getting at, don't you, Julia?

01:00:16.449 --> 01:00:17.962
l'm not sure l do, Johnny.

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:21.200
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise,
is that it?

01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:23.359
Please don't make me feel guilty about it.

01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:26.964
Even if it is a fool idea
that people dream about and then go flat on.

01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:29.847
Even if l find l've had
enough of it in three months, l want it.

01:00:29.929 --> 01:00:33.399
lf l let this chance go by,
there'll never be another for me...

01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:38.483
...so l don't think anyone will mind
if l just have a go at it, will they, Julia?

01:00:40.769 --> 01:00:42.202
Will they, dear?

01:00:43.409 --> 01:00:46.321
-Father, let Johnny and me talk awhile.
-Just a moment.

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.558
ln all my experience--

01:00:47.649 --> 01:00:50.880
Please, Father, it will be all right,
l promise you.

01:00:51.209 --> 01:00:55.919
Case, it strikes me you chose a strange time
to tell us this. A very strange time.

01:00:56.009 --> 01:00:58.125
-Father.
-l see, sir.

01:00:58.209 --> 01:00:59.164
Then <i>....</i>

01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:01.118
Then perhaps--

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:04.918
Father, please go down.
We'll come in a minute.

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:12.609
He didn't get what l was driving at, at all.

01:01:12.689 --> 01:01:16.682
Why did you do it? You knew
all that talk would antagonize him.

01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:19.681
-You think talk is all it was?
-l think it was less than that.

01:01:19.769 --> 01:01:21.248
l'm furious with you.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.285
lt wasn't just talk, Julia.

01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:26.527
You don't realize what Father
is offering you.

01:01:27.329 --> 01:01:29.001
Wait a minute, dear.

01:01:29.129 --> 01:01:32.246
-We'd better get clear on this.
-l'm clear on it right now.

01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:35.241
lf you think you can persuade me
that a man of your energy...

01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:38.560
...and your ability possibly
could quit at 30 <i>....</i>

01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:42.518
lf you're tired and want a rest,
why, we'll have it.

01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:45.643
Haven't you the remotest idea
of what l'm after?

01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:47.321
Yes, Johnny, l know.

01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:51.359
But you haven't any idea yet
of how exciting business can be.

01:01:51.449 --> 01:01:54.521
See it through.
You'll love it. l know you will.

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:57.328
There's no such thrill in the world
as making money.

01:01:57.409 --> 01:02:00.446
Darling, you don't see
what l'm aiming at either.

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:03.727
Try a little blind faith for a while, won't you?

01:02:03.809 --> 01:02:05.367
-Come along with me?
-But--

01:02:05.449 --> 01:02:06.882
No, the whole way, dear.

01:02:07.369 --> 01:02:12.124
Johnny, wait till next year or two years
and we'll think about it again.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:16.440
You can do that for me, for us, can't you?

01:02:19.289 --> 01:02:21.962
You think by then l'd be a good sport...

01:02:22.049 --> 01:02:24.609
...and come around,
that's what you think, don't you?

01:02:32.369 --> 01:02:35.839
lt lacks six minutes to the New Year
if anyone's interested.

01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:37.722
Come on, Johnny.

01:02:37.889 --> 01:02:40.164
Have Nick and Susan gone?

01:02:40.329 --> 01:02:42.160
l don't know. They weren't in my room.

01:02:42.249 --> 01:02:44.126
-Perhaps they're downstairs.
-Perhaps.

01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:47.845
Anyone care for a few cold cuts
before the fun starts?

01:02:48.569 --> 01:02:49.445
Come?

01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:52.558
This is plain stubbornness and you know it.

01:02:52.649 --> 01:02:53.877
Listen, Julia.

01:02:54.689 --> 01:02:57.078
No, that gets you nowhere, does it?

01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:00.968
Are you coming?

01:03:01.129 --> 01:03:03.723
l think l'll wait a moment with Linda
if you don't mind.

01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:05.083
But l do mind.

01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:06.802
Will you come, please?

01:03:06.889 --> 01:03:08.481
ln a moment, Julia.

01:03:21.809 --> 01:03:24.562
You'd better run on down now,
don't you think?

01:03:24.649 --> 01:03:25.968
Not right away.

01:03:28.009 --> 01:03:31.285
l'm afraid l won't know how to entertain you.
l've done all my stuff.

01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:33.325
l don't need entertaining.

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:40.279
You wouldn't care to step into a waltz
as the old year dies, would you, Mr. Case?

01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:43.327
Yes, l would. l'd love it.

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.804
There's a conspiracy
against you and me, child.

01:03:54.889 --> 01:03:56.242
What's that?

01:03:56.689 --> 01:03:58.407
-The vested interests.
-l know.

01:04:00.769 --> 01:04:04.205
They won't let you have any fun
and they won't give me time to think.

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:09.443
l suppose like the fathead you are, you told
Father all your little hopes and dreams?

01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:12.127
Pretty disappointing?

01:04:12.729 --> 01:04:15.004
-Bad enough.
-Poor boy.

01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:17.805
What about your own evening?

01:04:17.889 --> 01:04:19.481
Not so hot either.

01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:20.923
Poor girl.

01:04:28.129 --> 01:04:31.246
-Of course, they may be right.
-Don't you believe it.

01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:33.639
l don't know. They seem so awfully sure.

01:04:33.729 --> 01:04:38.200
lt's still your ride, isn't it?
You know where you want to go, don't you?

01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:42.401
-l thought l did.
-So did l.

01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:47.564
Pathetic, wasn't it, all my fuss and fury
over anything as unimportant as this party.

01:04:49.409 --> 01:04:51.001
Maybe it is important.

01:04:51.089 --> 01:04:54.365
Well, if it is, l'm not,
and l guess that's the answer.

01:04:57.129 --> 01:04:58.926
Linda, you're so sweet.

01:05:04.769 --> 01:05:06.521
Thanks, that's enough.

01:05:07.209 --> 01:05:08.608
lt was grand.

01:05:10.409 --> 01:05:11.558
Listen.

01:05:14.889 --> 01:05:15.924
That's it, all right.

01:05:16.009 --> 01:05:17.806
Happy New Year, Johnny.

01:05:18.689 --> 01:05:20.407
Happy New Year, Linda.

01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:28.924
You can count on sister Linda, Johnny.

01:05:29.249 --> 01:05:31.968
Run on down now. They'll be waiting.

01:05:44.529 --> 01:05:45.644
Linda.

01:05:46.649 --> 01:05:47.684
What?

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:52.527
They've <i>....</i>

01:05:52.809 --> 01:05:56.279
-Your father put me in a position--
-Johnny, do you love Julia?

01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:58.448
Of course l do.

01:05:58.529 --> 01:06:00.838
Well, if ever she needed you,
she needs you now.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.201
You're all that's left.

01:06:11.409 --> 01:06:12.808
Go on, Johnny.

01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:47.322
Happy New Year.

01:06:48.169 --> 01:06:49.522
Same to you.

01:06:53.049 --> 01:06:56.928
-What's it like to get drunk, Ned?
-lt's <i>....</i>

01:06:58.049 --> 01:06:59.004
How drunk?

01:06:59.969 --> 01:07:01.448
Good and drunk.

01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:03.204
Grand.

01:07:06.209 --> 01:07:07.483
How is it?

01:07:08.929 --> 01:07:13.047
Well, to begin with it brings you to life.

01:07:13.969 --> 01:07:15.004
Does it?

01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:19.088
And after a while
you begin to know all about it.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:23.128
You feel, l don't know, important.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:25.841
That must be good.

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.642
lt is.

01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:37.124
And then pretty soon the game starts.

01:07:37.649 --> 01:07:38.923
What game?

01:07:39.409 --> 01:07:43.482
A swell game, a terribly exciting game.

01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:47.280
You think clear as crystal...

01:07:47.369 --> 01:07:50.679
...but every move,
every sentence is a problem.

01:07:51.689 --> 01:07:53.805
That gets pretty interesting.

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:58.368
-You get beaten though, don't you?
-Sure, but that's good, too.

01:07:58.609 --> 01:08:01.919
Then you don't mind anything,
not anything at all.

01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:03.484
Then you sleep.

01:08:03.569 --> 01:08:05.287
How long can you keep it up?

01:08:05.729 --> 01:08:08.607
A long while. As long as you last.

01:08:08.769 --> 01:08:10.600
Ned, that's awful.

01:08:10.929 --> 01:08:13.727
Think so? Other things are worse.

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:15.721
Where do you end up?

01:08:15.889 --> 01:08:18.608
Where does everybody end up? You die.

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:20.600
And that's all right, too.

01:08:22.288 --> 01:08:25.884
Ned, can you do it on champagne?

01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:27.323
Why?

01:08:29.929 --> 01:08:31.647
What's the matter, Linda?

01:08:31.809 --> 01:08:33.002
Nothing.

01:08:34.209 --> 01:08:36.439
-l know.
-Yes?

01:08:37.089 --> 01:08:38.238
Johnny.

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:41.041
Give me some more wine, Ned.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:44.441
-He's in a spot, isn't he?
-Give me some, Ned.

01:08:48.969 --> 01:08:51.163
You can tell me about it, dear.

01:08:53.169 --> 01:08:55.000
l love the boy, Neddie.

01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:57.122
l thought so.

01:08:57.368 --> 01:08:58.881
Great, isn't it?

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:01.124
Great.

01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:05.000
Here's luck to you.

01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:06.886
l don't want any luck.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:21.477
Ladies and gentlemen, my good friends,
l have the honour to announce to you...

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:25.243
...the engagement of my daughter Julia
to Mr. John Case.

01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:30.844
An event which doubles the pleasure
l take in wishing you and them...

01:09:30.929 --> 01:09:34.046
...a most happy and prosperous New Year.

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:42.877
So happy together.

01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:44.124
Congratulations.

01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:46.966
Ned.

01:09:56.969 --> 01:09:58.197
Poor lamb.

01:10:41.809 --> 01:10:43.925
-Aren't you thrilled? lsn't it--
-l am.

01:10:44.009 --> 01:10:47.479
-l'm sure you'll be very happy.
-You're thinking of my sister.

01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:49.321
-What?
-Not l! My sister.

01:10:49.409 --> 01:10:51.525
Linda, now you must get married yourself.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.640
-Thank you.
-l'm so happy for you.

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:57.765
Thank you for coming down.

01:10:57.849 --> 01:11:01.159
You must go back to bed. The doctor said
you shouldn't excite yourself.

01:11:01.249 --> 01:11:03.717
What is this? Where's the lucky boy?

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.523
l haven't seen the lucky boy
since the announcement.

01:11:08.809 --> 01:11:11.926
-Linda, did you know about it?
-Of course l did.

01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:16.441
-Where is he?
-That's something l wouldn't know.

01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:20.365
l don't know. He wanted to argue
with Father. He didn't make sense.

01:11:20.449 --> 01:11:22.724
He said things to Father
he had no right to say.

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:26.438
Then after the announcement to go
downstairs and leave us. lt's horrible.

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:28.201
Please don't be so upset.

01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:31.526
l'll find him and bring him back.
Then everything will be fine.

01:11:31.609 --> 01:11:32.644
Of all times--

01:11:32.729 --> 01:11:36.608
-Linda, isn't it too marvellous?
-Too, too marvellous.

01:11:36.929 --> 01:11:37.884
l'll <i>....</i>

01:11:55.809 --> 01:11:58.767
-Linda, now you must get married.
-l hope l shall.

01:11:58.849 --> 01:12:00.601
Linda needs to find a husband.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:03.487
-Hello. lt is wonderful, isn't it?
-lt's simply lovely.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:06.322
-Hello. How's Baltimore?
-lt's fine, thank you.

01:12:07.609 --> 01:12:11.079
-Have you seen Mr. Case anywhere?
-Mr. Case went through here a moment ago.

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:12.443
Through there?

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:24.079
-Did Mr. Case come in here?
-Yes, ma'am, right through here, ma'am.

01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:26.125
''Happy New Year,'' he says.

01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:32.918
Congratulations to Miss Julia, ma'am.

01:12:33.769 --> 01:12:35.043
Thank you.

01:12:59.009 --> 01:13:01.569
-Linda. Come in.
-Hello, Susan. l'm sorry to butt in.

01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:04.561
Well, as l live. Look, it's the acrobat lady.

01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:06.640
-Glad to see you.
-Glad to see you, too.

01:13:06.729 --> 01:13:08.879
Run to the drug store
and get some champagne.

01:13:08.969 --> 01:13:11.119
-l tried to call.
-The phone's been discontinued.

01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:13.803
We pay our bills.
lt's that we're planning a little trip.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.242
-You're sailing?
-Tonight.

01:13:15.329 --> 01:13:16.921
Come on in and help us pack.

01:13:17.009 --> 01:13:21.002
The university gave me leave to work
in France. And we're doing our best <i>....</i>

01:13:21.089 --> 01:13:24.525
You ought to have some tea or something.
You look peaked.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:27.919
l've been hunting for Johnny.
l thought he'd be here. Have you seen him?

01:13:28.009 --> 01:13:29.124
Not since that night.

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:30.483
-You knew he walked out.
-Yes.

01:13:30.569 --> 01:13:33.208
He came here
and we talked until New Year's noon.

01:13:33.289 --> 01:13:34.927
Then he left town to think things over.

01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:38.046
-His letter said he'd be back today.
-Then l can see him!

01:13:38.129 --> 01:13:40.927
He's probably on his way.
Hasn't your sister heard from him?

01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:43.125
lf she has, she hasn't told me.

01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:47.248
-You love her a great deal, don't you?
-Yes. A lot of good that does.

01:13:47.329 --> 01:13:50.321
Can't you see
that if she feels as your father does--

01:13:50.409 --> 01:13:52.923
Johnny'll fix that. Johnny'll fix everything.

01:13:53.009 --> 01:13:56.399
lf l could only make Julia and Father
listen to me. l've got to.

01:13:56.489 --> 01:14:00.084
Johnny's so sweet, he's so attractive.
What's the matter with the girl anyway?

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:03.923
She ought to know by now that men
like Johnny don't grow on every bush.

01:14:04.009 --> 01:14:07.081
Linda, isn't it just possible
that the things we like in Johnny...

01:14:07.169 --> 01:14:09.319
...may be the very things she can't stand?

01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:14.483
The fate that you feel he'll save her from is
the one fate in this whole world she wants?

01:14:14.569 --> 01:14:15.843
l don't believe that.

01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:18.318
Even so,
she loves him and there's been a break.

01:14:18.409 --> 01:14:21.685
Wouldn't you think she'd be woman enough
to hang on?

01:14:21.769 --> 01:14:23.760
Yes, if she loves him.

01:14:24.249 --> 01:14:26.763
Julia has never in her life
loved anyone but Johnny.

01:14:26.849 --> 01:14:28.646
-Perhaps herself.
-That's not true.

01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:32.404
Even in this, it's of him she's thinking,
she may be mistaken, but it is of him.

01:14:32.489 --> 01:14:34.684
You don't know how a girl in love feels.

01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:38.045
-We're sorry, Linda, really.
-No, you're not. You're <i>....</i>

01:14:38.969 --> 01:14:40.766
What's the matter with me anyway?

01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:49.722
Even if l told you what was the matter
with you, you wouldn't admit it.

01:14:50.289 --> 01:14:53.486
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Pay no attention to her.

01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:56.561
lf you did anything else
then you wouldn't be what you are.

01:14:56.649 --> 01:14:59.641
Which to my professorial mind
is head of the class.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:02.482
-l love you two.
-And so do we love you.

01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:04.685
ln our rough, uncouth way, of course.

01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:07.124
-Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon.
-Yes?

01:15:07.209 --> 01:15:09.769
He's asking her
to sail with us and with him tonight.

01:15:09.849 --> 01:15:11.805
-What do you think she'll say?
-Yes.

01:15:11.889 --> 01:15:14.847
What if she doesn't? What happens then?
What's Johnny to do?

01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:17.685
What would you want him to do?

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.122
That may be he.

01:15:27.449 --> 01:15:28.962
Nicholas Porter?

01:15:29.729 --> 01:15:32.687
The name is Potter,
but don't let it bother you.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.598
Thanks.

01:15:56.409 --> 01:15:59.128
Julia will sail, she must, she's got to.

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:01.287
Good-bye.

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:13.244
Julia.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:16.886
Hello, dear. You'll be late
for the Todds' dinner, won't you?

01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:19.767
You had luncheon with Johnny.
He wants you to sail tonight.

01:16:19.849 --> 01:16:21.441
-You've seen him?
-The Potters told me.

01:16:21.529 --> 01:16:23.201
You must sail with him.

01:16:23.289 --> 01:16:26.645
-The Potters? Who are the Potters?
-Stop it, Julia.

01:16:27.089 --> 01:16:30.399
-Stop what?
-Pretending you don't care.

01:16:30.609 --> 01:16:33.407
You're taking my little difficulty
more seriously than l am.

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:36.640
Don't let Johnny go off tonight
and make a hash of both your lives.

01:16:36.729 --> 01:16:38.447
You can't let him sail alone.

01:16:38.529 --> 01:16:40.645
He's no more sailing than you are.

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:44.039
Does Father know
you aren't going to the Todds' dinner?

01:16:48.889 --> 01:16:51.449
Why do you want to shut me out
in the cold like this?

01:16:51.529 --> 01:16:53.281
l wasn't aware that l was.

01:16:54.369 --> 01:16:56.246
Won't you just talk to me?

01:16:56.329 --> 01:16:57.682
Please, Julia.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:01.481
lf there's been any shutting out done,
it's you who've done it.

01:17:01.569 --> 01:17:02.479
Me?

01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:06.164
Johnny and l have had a difference
and you're siding with him, aren't you?

01:17:06.249 --> 01:17:07.318
But he's right.

01:17:07.409 --> 01:17:11.243
-He's right for you as well as for himself.
-l think that's for me to decide.

01:17:11.329 --> 01:17:13.524
-Not Father?
-Father has nothing to do with it.

01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:15.918
He happens to agree with me
where you don't.

01:17:16.009 --> 01:17:16.964
But <i>....</i>

01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:22.882
But we've always agreed before, always.

01:17:23.809 --> 01:17:29.520
No. l think quite often l've given in,
in order to avoid scenes and upsets and <i>....</i>

01:17:29.609 --> 01:17:31.042
ls that true, Julia?

01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:35.042
You've always been the stronger character.
At least people have always thought so.

01:17:35.129 --> 01:17:37.199
You've made the decisions
and had the ideas.

01:17:37.289 --> 01:17:39.439
And you've been resenting me.

01:17:41.129 --> 01:17:42.767
l can't believe it.

01:17:43.049 --> 01:17:46.246
lt's nothing to get into a stew about.
l didn't say l resented you.

01:17:46.649 --> 01:17:48.799
You've been an immense help often.

01:17:49.369 --> 01:17:53.248
When it comes to determining my future and
the future of the man l'm going to marry--

01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:56.207
Your future, Julia?
What do you want, just security?

01:17:56.289 --> 01:17:59.440
Sit back smugly in your bank vault
among the worthies of the world?

01:17:59.529 --> 01:18:03.807
One thing l don't want is to start
this endless discussion all over again.

01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:08.362
You've only 20 minutes in which to dress.

01:18:09.409 --> 01:18:11.206
Linda, did you hear me?

01:18:11.849 --> 01:18:16.559
Father, l think you're both giving Johnny
the rottenest kind of a deal.

01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:18.401
-ln what way?
-ln every way.

01:18:18.489 --> 01:18:21.322
-You're not thinking of what's best for him.
-On the contrary.

01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:24.560
The young man's outlook
has merely become somewhat confused.

01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:27.083
-You'll straighten it out for him.
-We shall try.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:30.286
But why hasn't he the right
to live part of his life as he wants to?

01:18:30.369 --> 01:18:33.918
Linda, l should like to understand
what he and you are aiming at...

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.647
...but l confess, l cannot.

01:18:35.729 --> 01:18:38.038
l consider his whole attitude un-American.

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:40.801
-Are you serious?
-Entirely.

01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:43.119
Then he is
and he won't go to Heaven when he dies.

01:18:43.209 --> 01:18:47.919
He can't believe a life devoted to piling up
money is all it's cracked up to be.

01:18:48.009 --> 01:18:51.797
Strange, isn't it, when he has us right
before his eyes for such a shining example?

01:18:51.889 --> 01:18:55.484
l listened most attentively the other day
to our young dreamer...

01:18:55.569 --> 01:18:58.481
...and l still must confess
that the talk of the two of you...

01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:00.400
...seems to me of the 1 7-year-old variety.

01:19:00.489 --> 01:19:04.243
l'm glad if it is. We're grand at 1 7.
lt's after that, that sickness sets in.

01:19:04.329 --> 01:19:07.526
Well, l feel very well myself.

01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:11.923
You both think he'll come around.
Compromise, anyway.

01:19:12.009 --> 01:19:14.364
You'll get fooled.
He won't give way one inch.

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:17.441
-Stubborn?
-No, right and knows he's right.

01:19:27.969 --> 01:19:29.527
What's the matter, kid?

01:19:29.609 --> 01:19:31.600
l can't believe it, Ned.

01:19:32.489 --> 01:19:34.127
Johnny's clearing out.

01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:37.645
He's sailing tonight
and Julia won't lift a finger to stop him.

01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:40.243
l don't understand her.

01:19:40.569 --> 01:19:45.768
Most people, including Johnny and
yourself, make a big mistake about Julia.

01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:48.119
They're taken in by her looks.

01:19:48.209 --> 01:19:52.088
At bottom she's a very dull girl
and the life she pictures for herself...

01:19:52.169 --> 01:19:54.160
...is the life she belongs in.

01:19:54.369 --> 01:19:57.042
You've just never hit it off, that's all.

01:19:58.729 --> 01:20:00.924
-Ned.
-What?

01:20:01.529 --> 01:20:05.283
You remember
what we talked about on New Year's Eve?

01:20:05.929 --> 01:20:07.601
Sure, l remember.

01:20:07.689 --> 01:20:10.249
-Tell me something.
-Sure.

01:20:10.929 --> 01:20:13.648
Does it stand out all over me?

01:20:14.969 --> 01:20:16.004
Why?

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:19.008
Nick and Susan, this afternoon.
l think they got it.

01:20:19.209 --> 01:20:20.961
Anyone who loves you would, Linda.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.643
That's awful. l'm so ashamed.

01:20:24.969 --> 01:20:26.322
l'm not, though.

01:20:26.409 --> 01:20:28.001
Why should you be?

01:20:30.609 --> 01:20:32.645
Pardon me, Miss Linda.

01:20:32.889 --> 01:20:35.767
-Yes, Henry.
-Mr. Case is downstairs.

01:20:39.769 --> 01:20:41.646
Have him come up, will you, Henry?

01:20:41.769 --> 01:20:44.841
And, Henry, tell Miss Julia.

01:20:48.329 --> 01:20:50.240
He'll be up in a minute.

01:20:50.409 --> 01:20:52.877
Are you sure you want to get over him?

01:20:52.969 --> 01:20:55.608
No, l'm not and that's what scares me most.

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:57.680
l feel alive and l love it.

01:20:57.889 --> 01:21:00.642
l feel at last something's happening to me.

01:21:01.849 --> 01:21:04.727
But it can't get anywhere
so it's like living on that stuff.

01:21:04.809 --> 01:21:08.848
-l've got to get over it.
-Because it seems so hopeless, is that it?

01:21:08.929 --> 01:21:10.487
Seems? What do you mean?

01:21:10.569 --> 01:21:12.924
Don't you know?
Let me tell you something.

01:21:13.009 --> 01:21:15.762
You're twice as attractive
as Julia ever thought of being.

01:21:15.849 --> 01:21:19.888
You've got twice the looks,
twice the mind and 10 times the quality.

01:21:20.129 --> 01:21:24.122
You could charm a bird off a tree
if you would and why not?

01:21:24.449 --> 01:21:27.441
lf you were in her way
she'd ride you down like a rabbit.

01:21:27.529 --> 01:21:30.202
How could you, Ned,
knowing the way she loves him?

01:21:30.289 --> 01:21:33.122
-How could you?
-All right, Linda.

01:21:33.929 --> 01:21:35.157
Tell him hello for me, will you?

01:21:48.089 --> 01:21:51.001
-Hello, Linda.
-Hello, Johnny.

01:21:52.489 --> 01:21:53.922
l sent for Julia.

01:21:59.129 --> 01:22:01.324
l feel as if l'd been away quite a while.

01:22:01.409 --> 01:22:02.444
Yeah.

01:22:02.529 --> 01:22:04.565
-l went to Placid.
-l see.

01:22:04.649 --> 01:22:05.764
lt was <i>....</i>

01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:10.721
-lt was horrible there.
-l can imagine.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:16.446
-l'm going to take that job at the bank.
-l see.

01:22:16.529 --> 01:22:21.319
Only for a while, only for a couple of years.
Just until l can get it through to her that <i>....</i>

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:26.642
lt was what she asked and after all,
a couple of years isn't a lifetime.

01:22:26.929 --> 01:22:29.443
-ls it?
-Of course not.

01:22:30.249 --> 01:22:33.286
-l think everything will be all right, Johnny.
-Sure.

01:22:34.289 --> 01:22:37.599
l can see the way they feel about it.

01:22:38.089 --> 01:22:42.321
l could hardly expect them
to do a complete, sudden about-face but <i>....</i>

01:22:45.289 --> 01:22:47.723
But, hang it, why can't they see
what l'm getting at?

01:22:47.809 --> 01:22:49.925
Perhaps eventually they will.

01:22:50.449 --> 01:22:52.485
That's what l'm counting on.

01:22:53.129 --> 01:22:54.448
Linda...

01:22:56.009 --> 01:22:59.206
...you agree there's only one thing for me
to do now, don't you?

01:22:59.289 --> 01:23:00.608
Compromise?

01:23:01.089 --> 01:23:02.363
Yes.

01:23:03.049 --> 01:23:04.004
Yes.

01:23:05.769 --> 01:23:07.600
You think that's right, don't you?

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:10.965
-l don't think it matters a bit what l think.
-lt does though, Linda.

01:23:11.049 --> 01:23:13.802
You think it's right, don't you?
Say you think it's right.

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:17.802
Johnny, when two people love each other
as much as you do...

01:23:17.889 --> 01:23:20.767
...anything that keeps them apart
must be wrong.

01:23:23.449 --> 01:23:25.724
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

01:23:25.809 --> 01:23:28.721
They tell me you've been away.
Pleasant having you back.

01:23:28.809 --> 01:23:30.720
lt's pleasant to be back.

01:23:31.449 --> 01:23:34.521
There's been a rather noticeable absence
of snow these recent weeks.

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:35.724
Quite.

01:23:35.849 --> 01:23:38.409
Father, Johnny came tonight to see Julia.

01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:41.846
That doesn't surprise me a great deal,
Daughter, not a great deal.

01:23:41.929 --> 01:23:45.763
Julia, not you and me.
Come on, Dada, let's go bye-bye.

01:23:47.769 --> 01:23:49.441
Good evening, Johnny.

01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:53.848
-Get your coat, darling, we're going out.
-Yes, dear.

01:23:53.969 --> 01:23:56.688
Father, could you explain to the Todds?

01:23:56.809 --> 01:24:00.404
Please, close the door.
l wish to speak with you both.

01:24:09.889 --> 01:24:13.279
You insist on putting me into a position
that l don't in the least relish.

01:24:13.369 --> 01:24:14.848
Who's there? Come in, Ned.

01:24:14.929 --> 01:24:18.285
-Sorry. l just thought that <i>....</i>
-Come in.

01:24:21.809 --> 01:24:23.322
Sit down, Son.

01:24:23.929 --> 01:24:28.047
Coming between two young people in love
is furthest from my wish or intention.

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:31.485
For love, true love,
is a very rare and beautiful thing.

01:24:31.569 --> 01:24:34.402
Where are you going? Please, sit down.

01:24:35.929 --> 01:24:37.965
And l believe that its path...

01:24:39.369 --> 01:24:44.045
...that is to say the course of true love,
contrary to the adage, should run smooth.

01:24:44.169 --> 01:24:47.798
l am a man of 58 years and speak
from a long experience and observation.

01:24:47.889 --> 01:24:49.607
lt is of paramount importance--

01:24:49.689 --> 01:24:51.680
-l beg your pardon, sir?
-Yes?

01:24:52.049 --> 01:24:55.439
lf that position at the bank is still open
l'll be glad to take it.

01:24:56.849 --> 01:24:58.282
l'm still not convinced.

01:24:58.369 --> 01:25:01.998
l still don't believe in it,
but it's what Julia wishes and <i>....</i>

01:25:02.249 --> 01:25:04.080
And l'm glad to defer to her wish.

01:25:04.169 --> 01:25:07.718
-You're not convinced, you say?
-Would you like me to lie to you, sir?

01:25:07.809 --> 01:25:10.039
Father, it's enough for me.

01:25:10.249 --> 01:25:14.322
Julia said a year or two. l'll do
everything l can to make a success of it.

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:15.808
l have only one reservation.

01:25:15.889 --> 01:25:19.086
lf, at the end of that time,
l still think it's wise for me to quit...

01:25:19.169 --> 01:25:22.479
-...there won't be any objections.
-l doubt there'll be reason for any.

01:25:22.569 --> 01:25:24.366
We shall have to see about that.

01:25:24.449 --> 01:25:25.848
Well, Father?

01:25:28.009 --> 01:25:31.524
-When is it you wish to be married?
-As soon as possible.

01:25:34.489 --> 01:25:37.686
Now the sun shines once more
and we're all friends again.

01:25:37.769 --> 01:25:40.647
And now what are your plans
for your wedding trip, may l ask?

01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:44.244
-We haven't any definite--
-lt's wise to prearrange honeymoons.

01:25:44.329 --> 01:25:46.320
Now let me suggest a little itinerary.

01:25:46.409 --> 01:25:49.879
You will land at Plymouth or Southampton
and proceed straight to London.

01:25:49.969 --> 01:25:51.960
l shall cable my sister tomorrow.

01:25:52.329 --> 01:25:54.684
They will be delighted
to have you stay with them.

01:25:54.769 --> 01:25:57.886
He is one of the most
important men in British banking circles.

01:25:58.049 --> 01:26:01.598
You could scarcely go abroad
and not stop with your Aunt Helen, Julia.

01:26:01.929 --> 01:26:05.968
ln addition it will save hotel expenses and
Johnny can learn some British methods.

01:26:06.049 --> 01:26:07.801
Then l'll cable the Bovays in Paris.

01:26:07.889 --> 01:26:10.005
He's expert adviser
to the Minister of Finance.

01:26:10.089 --> 01:26:11.602
A valuable man for you to know.

01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:15.682
l had thought of this as a honeymoon
more than a business trip, sir.

01:26:15.769 --> 01:26:18.647
There's no harm in combining
a little business with pleasure.

01:26:18.729 --> 01:26:20.048
l've never found there was.

01:26:20.129 --> 01:26:22.723
They have a lovely place, Johnny,
just outside of Paris.

01:26:22.809 --> 01:26:27.599
Now a week in London, a week in Paris,
10 days in the South of France, ideal.

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:31.125
Then you could sail from Genoa
and return by southern route.

01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:33.769
l'll arrange to have your house
ready for you March 1 .

01:26:33.849 --> 01:26:35.168
Thanks, darling.

01:26:35.249 --> 01:26:36.602
What house is that, Julia?

01:26:36.689 --> 01:26:40.568
Father's lending us a place on 64th Street.
Wait till you see it.

01:26:40.649 --> 01:26:42.799
This is not to be a gift you know, not yet.

01:26:42.889 --> 01:26:45.847
After you've occupied it for some time...

01:26:45.929 --> 01:26:47.920
...my hard old heart may soften.

01:26:48.049 --> 01:26:50.882
Listen to him, his hard old heart.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.598
Would you also arrange for the servants?

01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:56.408
Julia, l'm sorry but l can't stand it.

01:26:58.169 --> 01:27:00.205
Would you mind telling me what you mean?

01:27:00.329 --> 01:27:02.718
l thought
this was a trial for a couple of years.

01:27:02.809 --> 01:27:05.164
lf we begin
with possessions and obligations...

01:27:05.249 --> 01:27:07.285
...we could never get out from under them.

01:27:07.369 --> 01:27:08.438
No!

01:27:09.249 --> 01:27:10.318
No.

01:27:11.249 --> 01:27:14.958
You've been extremely kind and generous,
but it's not for us.

01:27:15.849 --> 01:27:19.478
-But you <i>....</i> You said that--
-l'm back where l was, Julia.

01:27:19.569 --> 01:27:23.323
l can see now it's got to be a clean break,
it's simply got to.

01:27:24.769 --> 01:27:28.398
We've got to make our own life,
there's nothing to it if we don't.

01:27:28.489 --> 01:27:30.161
There's no other way to live it.

01:27:30.249 --> 01:27:34.128
Forget about wedding invitations and
all the rest of it. Let's get married tonight.

01:27:34.769 --> 01:27:37.806
-l must decide now, must l?
-Please.

01:27:38.249 --> 01:27:39.762
And if l say no?

01:27:42.009 --> 01:27:44.045
l'm going tonight by myself.

01:27:46.009 --> 01:27:47.965
Very well then. You can go.

01:27:50.689 --> 01:27:55.524
l suppose the fact is l love feeling free
even better than l love you, Julia.

01:27:57.329 --> 01:27:58.728
Good-bye, sir.

01:27:59.129 --> 01:28:01.563
l'm sorry we couldn't make a go of it.

01:28:01.649 --> 01:28:03.560
Thanks for trying anyway.

01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:09.039
Good-bye to you, Linda.
You've been sweet.

01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:13.801
Good-bye, Johnny.
l hope you find what you're looking for.

01:28:14.249 --> 01:28:16.001
l hope you do.

01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:17.924
Linda.

01:28:18.089 --> 01:28:19.363
Please, do.

01:28:23.529 --> 01:28:24.962
Good-bye, Ned.

01:28:33.489 --> 01:28:35.207
l'll miss that man.

01:28:36.969 --> 01:28:38.004
He's gone.

01:28:38.089 --> 01:28:40.728
-Yes, and in my opinion--
-Good riddance.

01:28:40.809 --> 01:28:44.688
-He's really gone.
-Never mind. He loves you, he'll be back.

01:28:44.769 --> 01:28:45.918
Be back?

01:28:46.409 --> 01:28:49.048
''Be back,'' did you say?
What do you think l am?

01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:51.438
l hope this experience,
hard as it may have been--

01:28:51.529 --> 01:28:53.645
Don't worry about me. l'm all right.

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:55.845
Even a little more than all right,
l should say.

01:28:55.929 --> 01:28:58.648
-What's with you? Will you kindly--
-You don't love him.

01:28:58.729 --> 01:29:00.003
Answer me. Do you or not?

01:29:00.089 --> 01:29:01.920
-What's that to you?
-You don't, do you?

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:04.762
lt's written all over you.
You're relieved he's gone.

01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:06.840
-Suppose l am?
-She asks me, suppose she is!

01:29:06.929 --> 01:29:10.001
-Are you? Say it.
-l'm so relieved l could sing with it.

01:29:10.089 --> 01:29:12.159
-ls that what you want?
-Yes, thanks.

01:29:12.489 --> 01:29:15.003
Neddie, Neddie, have l got a job now.

01:29:15.369 --> 01:29:18.008
ls your passport in order? Mine is.
What do you say?

01:29:18.089 --> 01:29:19.522
-Well, when?
-Now. Tonight.

01:29:19.609 --> 01:29:22.601
-l don't think l could.
-Sure you could. lf l can, you can.

01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:24.600
-Where are you off to?
-Will you come?

01:29:24.689 --> 01:29:28.477
-Where are you going?
-On a trip. On a big ride. Do you mind?

01:29:28.569 --> 01:29:30.002
Will you come, Ned?

01:29:30.089 --> 01:29:33.286
-Listen, Father--
-A trip now is out of the question.

01:29:35.089 --> 01:29:37.080
-You won't.
-Can't.

01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:38.807
-Caught?
-Maybe.

01:29:38.889 --> 01:29:41.608
-l'll be back for you, Ned.
-l'll be here.

01:29:42.049 --> 01:29:46.167
You've got no faith in Johnny, have you?
His little dream may fall flat, you think.

01:29:46.249 --> 01:29:48.399
What if it should? There will be another.

01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:52.164
l've got faith in Johnny.
Whatever he does is all right with me.

01:29:52.249 --> 01:29:54.479
lf he wants to dream for a while, he can...

01:29:54.569 --> 01:29:58.448
...and if he wants to come back and sell
peanuts, how l'll believe in those peanuts.

01:29:58.529 --> 01:30:00.724
Good-bye, Julia. Good-bye, Father.

01:30:00.809 --> 01:30:03.164
-Good-bye, Neddie.
-Good-bye, kid. Good luck.

01:30:03.249 --> 01:30:06.480
Never you fear,
l'll be back for you, my fine bucko.

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:07.797
All right.

01:30:07.889 --> 01:30:08.719
Linda.

01:30:08.809 --> 01:30:13.325
Try and stop me, someone.
Please someone try and stop me.

01:30:13.649 --> 01:30:15.526
l shall not permit it. l shall <i>....</i>

01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:19.767
-Permit Linda? Don't make me laugh.
-She's going with him, isn't she? lsn't she?

01:30:19.849 --> 01:30:22.568
-Going to get her Johnny.
-A fine chance she's got.

01:30:22.649 --> 01:30:24.879
Any bets? Any bets, Julia?

01:30:25.689 --> 01:30:26.804
To Linda.

01:30:26.929 --> 01:30:29.921
And while we're at it, Grandfather.

01:30:35.649 --> 01:30:39.927
Dear, what a trip this might have been
with Johnny along.

01:30:40.009 --> 01:30:41.761
Will you please stop it, Nick?

01:30:42.809 --> 01:30:44.879
l can't stop it, Susan. l'm miserable.

01:30:44.969 --> 01:30:47.324
Thinking of him
l should say.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:50.685
-Shut up, dearest.
-For two cents, l'd call off the whole thing.

01:30:50.889 --> 01:30:52.766
-Johnny.
-Johnny. My word.

01:30:52.849 --> 01:30:55.522
-Where's Julia?
-l left her sitting on her golden throne.

01:30:55.609 --> 01:30:58.248
-Johnny is taking the big ride by himself.
-No.

01:30:58.409 --> 01:31:00.969
Boy, champagne,
any amount of it, but hurry.

01:31:01.049 --> 01:31:03.279
<i>-Oui, Monsieur Porter.</i>
-The name is Potter.

01:31:03.369 --> 01:31:06.008
Let's change our name to Porter.
Then they'll call us Potter.

01:31:06.089 --> 01:31:07.078
What happened?

01:31:07.169 --> 01:31:10.320
l've just wakened out of a nightmare.
Everything will be all right.

01:31:10.409 --> 01:31:12.798
l know it is. Come on, children, come on.

01:31:20.329 --> 01:31:22.399
ls this where the club meets?

01:31:26.449 --> 01:31:27.768
Right here.
