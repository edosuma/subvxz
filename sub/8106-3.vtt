WEBVTT

00:12.930 --> 00:15.390
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

00:15.849 --> 00:19.936
Unfortunately, as much as I
admire your spirit...

00:33.992 --> 00:38.955
Subject anesthetized with.5 CC's
of sodium pentobarbital.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.333
Transfected with
human hepatic cancer cells.

00:42.459 --> 00:48.423
Underwent six rounds of intra-abdominal
treatment with ES-22.

00:50.217 --> 00:55.763
Vertical incision through the rectus
sheath opens the abdominal cavity.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.808
Incision extended into...

00:59.309 --> 01:00.768
the thorax.

01:06.024 --> 01:09.861
Liver appears normal in color.
No apparent scarring or...

01:11.864 --> 01:13.156
Damn it!

01:14.533 --> 01:18.953
Cancerous tumors still present
on the right lobe,

01:19.455 --> 01:24.584
1.12 centimeters in diameter.
No reduction.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.703
71-year-old
cancer research specialist.

02:42.830 --> 02:47.124
Minor tremors, a localized melanoma
removed two years ago, cataracts.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.292
And he can't breathe.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.753
Also, disregard the facial lacerations.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.797
They're creepy, but unfortunately
irrelevant.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.675
Don't you wanna know why?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.218
You have your cane.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.637
No, why the lacerations
are creepy.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.557
He was about to dissect one of his lab
rats when he collapsed.

03:02.683 --> 03:07.228
The little vermin seized the day, so to
speak, and went medieval on his ass.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.064
What? My fly open?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.066
So, the pain's returned?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.985
There was no pain.
He was unconscious.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.820
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.238
We're talking about you.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.657
Obviously. I'm obviously not.

03:19.783 --> 03:20.867
What is it with you people?

03:20.993 --> 03:22.910
I don't use the cane, you're shocked.
I use the cane...

03:23.036 --> 03:24.120
We're just concerned.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.330
About the wrong person.
I can breathe.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.499
Ezra Powell, on the other hand,
is gonna die.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.293
- The Ezra Powell?
- The researcher?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.627
The guy who wrote
that textbook?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.212
"That" textbook?
The textbook.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.548
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

03:35.674 --> 03:38.634
I admire lots of doctors.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.387
Of course, most of them look a lot
better in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

03:41.680 --> 03:42.930
but seeing as they
can all breathe...

03:43.056 --> 03:45.808
Oxygenation is through the floor
and lungs are full of fluid.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.476
Gotta be his heart.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.603
Could be amyloidosis.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.064
Or his lungs, probably from years of
inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.317
It's not the lungs.
The chest x-ray's clean.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.860
So's his EKG.
It's not his heart.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.612
We're being too nice.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.156
Outside the hospital
he can't breathe.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.575
Inside the hospital he can,
because we help,

04:02.701 --> 04:04.952
at least enough to screw with
our test results.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.622
The source of the problem's either
in his heart or his lungs,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.458
so all we gotta do is
stop helping,

04:10.584 --> 04:12.752
put a little pressure on him
and see which gives out first.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.504
At 71, we get his
heart or lungs to give out,

04:15.631 --> 04:17.048
we might not get them to give in again.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.091
That's why we're gonna do it
in a hospital.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.553
Put him on an inclined treadmill
and do a stress EKG.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.890
So much for the admiration.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.187
Let's get you started.
I'll turn your oxygen up.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.732
I...

04:34.942 --> 04:39.278
I worked with Williams on the first
protocol for this machine.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.155
Everyone still uses it.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.867
Except for Williams.
He died four years ago.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.452
I'm sorry.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.497
He was 84.
He died parasailing.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.376
He was always an idiot.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.837
You okay?

04:57.464 --> 05:01.008
Hang in there. You know the protocol's
only a few minutes.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.636
His heart rate's flat.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.972
If we don't get it past 130,
we're not going to see anything.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.391
And if he falls and breaks a hip, we're
not going to see anything either.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.602
Except an increase
in our malpractice insurance.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.107
I figured House might
go back to the pills,

05:16.233 --> 05:19.443
but if he's using his cane,
he's right back to where he was before.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.403
Maybe even worse.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.614
Luckily, he'll handle it
in a stoic, grown-up fashion.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.950
He'd never take it out on us.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.872
I can't.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.291
I've got to stop.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.419
Just a little longer.

05:41.091 --> 05:44.760
His heart rate's only 90.
I'm going to increase the incline.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.682
I've got to stop.
I've got to get off.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.726
You're doing great.
Just a little faster, okay?

05:51.852 --> 05:55.521
I don't need a cheerleader,
I need oxygen.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.649
Stop. This isn't working.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.240
His heart rate
barely got above 90.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.701
He can't breathe.
There's too much fluid in his lungs.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.412
Really?
He's got fluid in his lungs?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.206
Whatever are we gonna do?
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.834
Put him on a treadmill and run him like
one of his rats on a wheel.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.419
He can't run.
He can hardly walk.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.712
That's 'cause he's not
trying hard enough.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.338
If he was, his heart rate
would go up.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.175
Exercising with a lung full of
your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.886
They don't call it
a stress test for nothing. Do it again.

06:27.012 --> 06:27.970
He's drowning.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.640
Then pull him out of the pool
and do it again.

06:35.687 --> 06:40.066
I'm assuming this isn't
your idea of a long-term solution.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.692
We need to get rid
of the fluid in your lungs,

06:41.818 --> 06:43.277
so you'll be able
to do the test.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.446
To see if it's my heart
or my lungs?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.739
Exactly.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.157
My money's on both.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.495
I've been in and out of the hospital
for the past year.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.540
I'm old. I'm sick.
And I'm getting older and sicker.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.294
Not a very interesting
differential but...

07:01.797 --> 07:03.172
I'm in.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.892
You don't need a $400 handbag.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.978
It's kinda hard to check your throat
when you're flapping your gums around.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.230
Sorry.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.773
But it's for the fall formal.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.610
He doesn't care if it's for
the Presidential Inauguration.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.113
But I'm using Marissa'a
old dress. It's free.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.906
You know what else is free?

07:29.032 --> 07:32.201
The roof over your head, the food
you eat, your phone, your computer.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.828
How long have you
been congested?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.413
All week, ever since we
got back from Fresno.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.583
Fresno? That's in France,
right? See the Parthenon?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.252
California.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.463
I've got no appetite,
I'm aching all over, I'm weak.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.174
- Does that hurt?
- Oh, yeah.

07:47.592 --> 07:51.679
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.430
Totally.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.518
I'm gonna take that giggle
as a "no".

07:57.644 --> 08:00.104
Fever, aches, weakness,
loss of appetite.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.940
You been having an anal sex
with IV drug users lately?

08:03.066 --> 08:05.151
Of course not. I'm married.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.485
You think she might have
been having...

08:06.653 --> 08:08.279
No!

08:08.697 --> 08:10.114
Probably a rhinovirus.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.365
What's that?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.075
A cold.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.329
Take this four times a day,
and stay off airplanes.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.456
They're flying cesspools.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.293
Oops!

08:23.461 --> 08:25.337
You dropped something.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.592
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.514
- Yes?
- He's too old and weak.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.694
Yeah, this is way better.
This'll work.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.863
Just try.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.575
There are 20 words
to describe chest pain.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.913
Burning, squeezing,
stabbing, tearing...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.415
Each one
diagnostically useful.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.919
For that, you have to thank
Dr. Powell's textbook.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.881
But there are no words to describe
degrees of what he's feeling right now.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.674
Shortness of breath.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.386
If he had worked
on those issues, there would be.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.306
He never would have given up
until he had an answer.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.058
This isn't working.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.938
Dr. House...

09:24.064 --> 09:25.189
Please don't get up.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.899
I'm sure you're very busy,

09:27.025 --> 09:29.944
I'm just gonna try
and speed things up a little.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.779
Is that epi?
That's not the protocol.

09:31.905 --> 09:36.951
No. The protocol is what you tried
to do and failed each time.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.374
Over 100. Now we're
getting somewhere.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.416
How does it look, Foreman?

09:44.542 --> 09:46.168
No EKG changes.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.545
Then we push harder.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.797
House, you're gonna kill him.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.383
No, he's right. Let him do it.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.344
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.971
He can't breathe.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.852
130, our magic number.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.855
Nothing here. Foreman?

10:06.982 --> 10:08.315
Still no sign of blockage.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.362
Which means it's not the heart.
It must be the lungs.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.991
See, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.620
No. Just give me the rest
of the epinephrine.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.998
The test is over. It's okay.
We're going to stabilize you.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.291
No.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.919
No, just let me die.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.004
You're not gonna die.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.839
Yes, I am.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.799
We'll find a treatment.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.261
I don't want to
live like this.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.890
Please, I'm begging you.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.476
Kill me.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.191
He says no more tests.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.360
He wants to die and he wants us
to help him do it.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.905
And I wanna play a little game I like
to call Block My Spike with Misty May.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.283
He's thought this through.
It's not an impulsive decision.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.201
Neither is mine.
He's depressed.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.911
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.538
He's seen all the tests
we've seen.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.582
Even if we figure out
what's causing the lung damage,

11:06.708 --> 11:07.833
it's too late to reverse it.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.793
You can't know that
without knowing what's wrong.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.086
It's his call.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.212
So what do we do?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.298
Do we just put a plastic bag
over his head and get it over with?

11:14.424 --> 11:17.259
No, we give him
a syringe full of morphine.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.097
Every doctor I've ever practiced with
has done it.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.766
They don't want to,
they don't like to,

11:23.892 --> 11:26.310
- but that's the way it is.
- I haven't. I won't.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.227
I couldn't do it either.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.396
You just said we should
respect his decision.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.982
Respect it doesn't necessarily
mean we honor it.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.568
Right. It just means
we talk about it.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.364
At some point, "do no harm" has to mean
allowing nature to take its course,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.157
not stubbornly
standing in the way of it.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.452
Sticking a metal syringe
into a plastic IV line and pumping in

11:43.578 --> 11:46.747
a lethal dose of morphine is not
letting nature take its course,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.123
not according to
the State of New Jersey.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.126
So it's better we allow him
to slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.128
Whose side are you on,
Senator?

11:53.254 --> 11:56.340
First respect his wishes, then invade
Iraq, then get the troops home.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.384
- Make up your mind.
- Wow.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.220
There's certainly a lot of interesting
things to consider.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.931
The stress EKG
rules out the heart,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.682
which means something's
gotta be attacking his lungs.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.144
Could be mycoplasma
or Strep pneumo, which probably means

12:09.270 --> 12:11.688
it's too late
to do anything about it.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.565
We could try levofloxacin.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.734
Coming up with a new treatment
isn't gonna do us any good

12:15.860 --> 12:18.153
unless we convince him
it's worth trying.

12:18.279 --> 12:22.199
Come on. He's old
and sick and tiny.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.201
And we can do
whatever we want to him.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.754
What happened?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.214
I don't know.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.382
He must have fallen out of bed

12:38.508 --> 12:41.593
and got the nasal cannula
wrapped around his neck somehow.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.637
Ezra, what are you doing?

12:43.763 --> 12:48.267
I don't want to live hooked to machines,
too weak to wipe my own ass.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.852
Why would you want to
wipe your own ass

12:49.978 --> 12:51.437
when you could have someone
do it for you?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.105
You're wasting your time.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.232
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

12:55.358 --> 12:59.319
All services rendered
on a first come, first served basis.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.322
I won't consent
to any more tests.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.368
And if anyone tries to
so much as touch me,

13:07.162 --> 13:09.288
I'll press charges
for assault.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.833
You heard the man.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.670
He wants everyone to leave him alone.
Why don't you go first?

13:18.006 --> 13:19.298
Get out!

13:28.349 --> 13:31.101
You came to me.
I didn't come to you.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.061
I figured you'd have the guts

13:33.188 --> 13:36.106
to do what had to be done
if it came to that.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.277
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.408
Breathe!

13:46.534 --> 13:47.993
You're gonna have to
exhale sometime.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.077
Stop!

13:49.204 --> 13:50.329
House, you're hurting him.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.538
You're hurting me.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.922
Fine. If you don't help us,
we don't help you.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.760
Your lungs slowly
fill with fluid.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.013
You gasp to catch every breath,
but never can.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.140
Every breath is petrifying.

14:10.808 --> 14:15.187
It'll be slow,
painful, torturous.

14:16.940 --> 14:21.193
We don't choose our birth.
And we don't choose our death.

14:23.404 --> 14:27.157
What if you could?
How about we make a deal?

14:28.159 --> 14:29.910
Give me one more day.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.373
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.584
- I'll help you die.
- House.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.004
Twenty-four hours.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.633
Come on,
it's not gonna kill you.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.185
Old guy, lungs, fluid. Go.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.478
You cannot help him
kill himself.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.437
Of course I can.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.855
Chase says we do it
all the time.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.608
- Cuddy is not gonna let you.
- Enough!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.318
You don't want me to kill him.
Fine.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.404
Here's a big shock.
I don't want to kill him either.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.490
How do I not kill him?
By you guys doing your job.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.286
We have 24 hours to figure out
what's wrong with him.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.453
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.498
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria in his blood.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.958
That's gonna take
longer than 24 hours.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.334
Not if I spin down the sample.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.254
Separate off the buffy coat,
then Gram stain for bacteria.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.675
Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer,
C-reactive peptide, get a urine,

15:26.801 --> 15:28.635
and do a bronchial sputum
while you're at it.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.138
And you, check his home
and lab for radiation and toxins.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.431
And do a bone marrow biopsy.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.641
- All of that in 24 hours?
- Nah.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.353
Whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.389
Wow. You guys look like crap.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.017
- What have you got?
- Purple dye on my fingers.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.395
- What did the bone marrow biopsy
show?
- I don't have the results.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.563
What? What have you
been doing all night?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.440
Jell-O shots and wild sex,
what else?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.609
There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.903
We still have some cooking,
but so far, nothing.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.029
Nothing in the urine.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.366
Lab was clean enough to do surgery in,
because, well, they do.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.536
And there was no sign of viruses
or fleas on any of the rats.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.829
Yeah.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.373
Who?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.334
Tell her to call the clinic.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.462
Then tell her to leave a message
and I'll get back to her.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.006
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.509
- Who's that?
- That's your protégé.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.844
What are these?

17:33.970 --> 17:35.637
Dictation tapes. He records everything.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.638
Why?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.348
Because he's
a diligent researcher?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.683
Or he's losing his memory.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.268
A lot of people
dictate their notes.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.229
Yes, we could assume that
and we'd have nothing.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.814
Or we could assume
it's a symptom,

17:45.940 --> 17:49.234
in which case whatever's in his lungs
is also in his brain,

17:49.360 --> 17:50.652
unless you've got
something more promising.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.320
I'll go get an MRI
of his head.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.364
Keep testing
till you find something.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.242
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

17:58.828 --> 18:03.081
It's been a long time
since I took an anatomy class,

18:03.207 --> 18:07.294
but I'm pretty sure you're moving
farther and farther away from my lungs.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.755
Running out of places to look,
aren't you?

18:09.881 --> 18:11.965
It doesn't mean
we're gonna stop looking.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.134
Oh, no.
Not for six more hours.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.428
- Do you want us to fail?
- No.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.805
But you will.

18:28.316 --> 18:32.235
No abnormal nuclei means
no leukemia. He a drinker?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.528
Not according to the history.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.654
Which means yes, he drinks,

18:34.781 --> 18:37.574
which gives us a nice mundane
explanation for the acellularity.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.744
Or he's telling the truth, which means
fungus is still on the table.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.789
But your entire view
of human nature gets destroyed.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.416
Six of one,
half a dozen of the other.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.587
Bad news fast. Good news,
you can take your time.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.340
Head's clean. You were wrong.
His faculties are intact.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.258
Too bad.
If his brain was addled,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.052
we wouldn't have
to listen to anything he says.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.678
Hand me the 10 percent KOH.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.388
It's 4:00.
We have nothing to tell him.

19:00.515 --> 19:03.475
Then we have no reason to talk to him.
We still haven't ruled out fungus.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.353
Yeah, we have.
No bugs, no hyphae.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.067
Okay. Next procedure.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.528
We sneak in,
turn back the clock.

19:20.117 --> 19:24.162
Whole team. Must be bad news.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.163
Nope.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.376
Your bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.379
It's not good news,
but there are some treatments.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.090
- I need to draw some blood.
- What about my breathing?

19:35.216 --> 19:37.300
Associated hyper-viscosity syndrome

19:37.426 --> 19:39.386
gummed up the blood vessels
in your lungs.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.265
Dr. Chase said
my calcium is normal.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.767
We call him Dr. Idiot.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.978
There's no
M protein in my urine.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.604
Odd presentation.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.317
It's so odd that Dr. Cameron
doesn't believe it either.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.323
Just give me 12 more hours.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.951
We had a deal. No more tests.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.122
Fair enough.
Give me six more hours.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.001
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.961
You a man of your word or not?

20:13.087 --> 20:14.713
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm not.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.340
Fine. Then discharge me.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.803
My lungs will slowly
fill with fluid.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.766
I'll gasp to
catch every breath, but never can.

20:26.893 --> 20:32.063
Every breath will be petrifying.
It'll be slow, painful, torturous.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.069
You really gonna
let me die like that?

21:16.651 --> 21:18.944
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.673
Everybody who can walk
should get out of here.

21:40.758 --> 21:43.385
- You can't do that.
- I can't do what?

21:43.511 --> 21:47.180
Administer a prescription pain killer
to a patient who's in pain?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.306
Go.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.809
Make sure somebody sees you
downstairs in the cafeteria.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.852
I can't let you do this.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.982
Either I die in pain
or I just die.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.985
That's what the argument is here.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.612
No. It's about whether
you die or we murder you.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.697
What's gonna happen here

22:03.823 --> 22:07.283
is that someone's
getting a buttload of morphine.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.995
I'm not sure exactly who
at this point.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.555
I can't be a part of this.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.414
Thank you.

22:57.918 --> 23:02.338
I always wondered exactly what
was on the other side.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.467
Nothing.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.544
What are you doing?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.588
Getting a laryngoscope.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.343
Don't just stand there, help!

23:48.469 --> 23:49.427
But you told him that...

23:49.553 --> 23:51.304
A little something
I like to call a lie.

23:51.472 --> 23:55.225
It's bad, I know, but it's way further
down the list than murder.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.236
He's unconscious.
No more whining.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.155
We can keep testing him.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.245
Go get a ventilator.
I'm not gonna do this all night.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.462
We can legally assume
that he'd consent

24:24.588 --> 24:26.923
to whatever a reasonable person
would consent to.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.802
And a reasonable person would
obviously consent to being put

24:30.928 --> 24:34.389
in a coma against their will
just to satisfy your curiosity?

24:34.682 --> 24:38.059
I try to kill him, you're mad.
I don't kill him, you're mad.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.519
All he wanted
was some dignity.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.895
Were you in that room
with him?

24:41.021 --> 24:44.440
Was he wearing a tux while he
was choking on his own plasma?

24:44.567 --> 24:50.155
Keep doing the tests. Take your time.
Do it right. Go! Get to work.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.824
Wait!

24:56.745 --> 25:00.331
Cameron, why did you do these cuts
so far down on this MRI of his head?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.958
I wanted to get his brain stem
and his C-spine

25:02.084 --> 25:03.960
to make sure his diaphragm
wasn't paralyzed.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.630
You also caught the top of his lungs.
There's scarring.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.760
You do know that you can't really pierce
me with your stares.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.514
Lung scarring along with the bad bone
marrow points to an autoimmune
disease.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.683
- Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
- Or lupus.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.685
He can kill himself
after we get him better.

25:20.811 --> 25:23.563
Start him on an IVIG
for the lupus and get a colonoscopy.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.815
The lupus could be
hiding there.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.157
I can't do this.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.329
Drama queen.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.582
Descending colon's clean.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.710
Moving into the sigmoid...

25:46.795 --> 25:49.088
We sure could use
a little more help around here.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.840
She's doing what
she believes in.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.427
Yeah, if she was acting on principle,
she'd be in here trying to stop us.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.721
All she's doing is
running away from the principle,

25:56.847 --> 25:58.806
so she won't have to feel
uncomfortable facing it.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.099
And if you were
acting on principle,

26:00.226 --> 26:01.059
you would have called the cops

26:01.185 --> 26:03.895
when you thought House
was killing the guy.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.939
- We better hurry up.
- Why?

26:06.523 --> 26:08.024
'Cause I don't think she's
gonna have a problem

26:08.150 --> 26:10.777
deciding what to tell Cuddy.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.405
02 sats,
89 and dropping.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.872
I thought you were only
supposed to put on

26:23.040 --> 26:24.624
a pound a week
during your last trimester.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.876
I'm not pregnant.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.504
I heard about
your little stunt with Dr. Powell.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.799
Not really a stunt.
More of a trick. A ruse, a hoodwink.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.467
- A lie.
- Okay.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.928
Lying is sometimes good,
right?

26:37.054 --> 26:40.723
Like when you're trying to teach
someone
a lesson about humility or something.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.601
All I'm trying to do is save his life.
He's not gonna learn anything.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.978
I just thought
the same principle might apply.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.354
It does.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.731
I could have just let him die.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.775
We're not gonna get sued
for keeping him alive.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.778
We could.
I completely disregarded his wishes.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.240
Do you want me to disagree with you?
You want me to yell at you?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.366
It is comforting.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.786
We're doctors.
We treat patients, we don't kill them.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.330
How right you are, Dr. Cuddy!

27:04.456 --> 27:07.625
We also don't pad our bills,
swipe samples from the pharmacy,

27:07.751 --> 27:10.628
or fantasize about the teenage daughters
of our patients, either.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.798
True. It better be true,
and you're a pig.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.136
I'm sorry about your leg.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.848
Yeah. We really should
spend some time talking about that.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.933
The IVIG made him worse.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.768
02 sats plummeted.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.313
So we know it's not lupus.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.814
What else could it be?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.066
Idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.278
We're gonna need
an open lung biopsy to confirm.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.364
So now we're gonna
operate on the guy?

27:38.490 --> 27:42.660
Well, unless you've invented
a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.915
When you searched
Dr. Powell's office,

27:48.042 --> 27:51.836
did you find a copy of the January 1967
Massachusetts Medical Journal?

27:51.962 --> 27:52.795
Why?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.839
I just figured
if you're not doing any work,

27:55.174 --> 27:57.425
you might like something
to pass the time.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.552
The centerfold's a killer.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.026
How's your leg?

28:15.152 --> 28:17.612
It hurts. And it's gonna
keep on hurting.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.740
- You gonna keep on asking?
- How's Ezra Powell?

28:21.909 --> 28:23.409
Resting comfortably.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.828
That's not what Cameron says.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.789
I hate practicing medicine
in high school.

28:27.915 --> 28:31.667
He's not asking you to help him kill
himself. He's just asking for help.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.086
The disease will kill him.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.630
I know what he was asking for.
I just said, "No."

28:35.756 --> 28:38.007
You've done it before,
plenty of times.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.801
To patients that I knew
were terminal.

28:39.927 --> 28:40.927
Oh, give me a break.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.346
This has nothing to do
with saving a life.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.847
You just can't bear
the thought of a patient dying

28:44.973 --> 28:46.933
before you've been able to
figure out why.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.228
If we're gonna keep refusing
to cure patients just to rein in my ego,

28:50.354 --> 28:52.939
then we might start having a little
problem in patient recruitment.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.150
Worried about meeting
your one-patient-a-week quota?

28:56.402 --> 29:00.238
I'm a cripple, remember?
Accommodations must be made.

29:09.957 --> 29:13.292
Wedge of left lobe isolated,
and removed.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.754
Clamp.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.051
Why'd you have me
look up that article?

29:22.177 --> 29:23.219
Did you find it interesting?

29:23.387 --> 29:25.596
He injected newborn babies
with radioactive agents

29:25.722 --> 29:27.515
just to see
if they had urethral reflux.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.724
He was curious.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.144
He didn't even tell their parents
he was doing an experiment.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.146
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.481
His peers at Tuskegee
and Willowbrook?

29:35.607 --> 29:38.067
He ignored the rights of a few
to save many.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.944
So you're okay
with what he did?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.029
It doesn't matter
what I think.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.240
It's what you think
that's relevant.

29:44.867 --> 29:48.870
Because if I think
less of him, I'll help you more?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.874
You're wrong.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.043
The fact that a patient did bad things
doesn't change anything.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.921
He still deserves to
have some control over his own body.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.591
If he had control
over his own body, he'd be dead.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.886
Some control. We can withhold
treatment without killing him.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.138
No, you can't!

30:07.264 --> 30:11.851
You either help him live or you help
him die. You can't have it both ways.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.566
Well, I guess it's not IPF.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.739
Maybe he'll die right now,
make everything easy for all of us.

30:29.369 --> 30:32.079
- Heart rate's fast.
- BP's low.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.792
No breath sounds on the right side.
He's dropped his right lung.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.588
Air's building up in his chest,
compressing his heart.

30:52.809 --> 30:53.809
Heart rate's decreasing.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.811
BP's stabilizing.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.917
What are you doing?

31:24.216 --> 31:27.385
He withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side but not the right.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.011
Those are just reflex arcs.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.346
He's under anesthesia.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.890
Or he's lost sensation
in some places.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.935
Or the hypoxia from the arrest
stunned his CNS.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.604
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.232
We can't do that
while he's in a coma.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.819
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer
and check his deep tendon reflexes.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.030
It won't work. He needs muscle relaxants
to be on the ventilator.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.741
Only one more way to tell.
Pupillary reflexes.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.286
- All that tests is the brain stem.
- See, I was right.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.038
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.207
I just said, we can't do that
while he's in a coma.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.959
So wake him up.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.934
Don't go towards the light.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.938
You'll fall
and break your hip.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.965
What's happening? I...

32:50.052 --> 32:51.886
You took a little nap.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.891
I thought I told you
I didn't want...

32:57.017 --> 32:58.934
Sorry. A little deaf
in one ear.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.562
Your bone marrow
is hypocellular.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.982
We've ruled out lupus
and pulmonary fibrosis.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.069
But it looks like it could be
attacking your nerves.

33:08.195 --> 33:12.031
So this is all a waste?
A huge failure?

33:13.825 --> 33:17.370
Impossible.
You're Gregory House.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.664
We need to attach some sensors
to your skin.

33:19.873 --> 33:20.706
No.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.541
Look, we can't
do what you want.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.419
We've assigned a nurse to watch you,
so you can't do it either.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.129
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.006
No. I want to be discharged.

33:29.132 --> 33:32.093
You can't be discharged.
You've got two chest tubes in.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.260
Then take them out!

33:33.387 --> 33:35.012
Oh, get over yourself.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.973
The ventilator puffed up your lungs.
You'll be fine for a few hours.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.101
Just let us run the tests.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.813
Okay.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.150
But first,
let's clean you up a little.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.905
- What...
- Does that feel nice?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.074
- What are you trying to prove?
- Just cleaning him up.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.034
What does it look like?

33:57.911 --> 34:00.996
Pay no attention
to the man behind the curtain.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.626
Get out!

34:06.128 --> 34:09.755
Okay, I'm going already.
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.218
Okay, so you've
got me curious.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.386
I was right.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.847
Whatever is attacking his lungs
is attacking his nerves.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.598
And you got that by
splashing ice water on him?

34:19.725 --> 34:22.560
No sensation in the left leg,
abdomen, right arm.

34:22.686 --> 34:23.853
Technology's overrated.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.646
That means the clean MRI
of his brain means

34:25.772 --> 34:27.314
it's just affecting
the peripheral nerves.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.524
And bone marrow.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.151
Kawasaki's would explain
the kidney failure.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.361
- So would lymphoma.
- So would sarcoidosis.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.573
All potentially treatable.
The question is which?

34:35.699 --> 34:38.576
We need to catch
the little bastards in the act.

34:38.702 --> 34:39.660
What's the largest organ?

34:39.786 --> 34:42.037
- Skin.
- We need to get a piece.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.750
Sure. We'll just wait until he leaves
his room without his skin,

34:45.876 --> 34:47.877
sneak in and take a piece.

34:48.837 --> 34:51.839
I want you to get
a skin sample for a biopsy.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.216
And I want to get a foot massage
from Johnny Damon.

34:54.342 --> 34:58.304
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis are all treatable.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.974
And it could be a hundred other things
that aren't treatable. You have no idea.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.392
But you do.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.394
- You know everything.
- I didn't say that I...

35:05.520 --> 35:06.645
Exactly!

35:07.272 --> 35:10.149
You can't decide if we're helping
or hurting him.

35:10.275 --> 35:14.820
If it's good or bad, or if you want
paper, plastic, or a burlap sack.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.115
Do your damn job.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.536
I'm not gonna lie to him.

35:26.708 --> 35:30.669
Fine. Tell the truth.
Just get me a pound of flesh.

35:38.762 --> 35:39.637
What do you want?

35:39.763 --> 35:42.973
House wants to biopsy your skin.
He sent me to get it.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.141
And you agreed?

35:44.267 --> 35:47.895
I had nothing to do with putting you in
a coma or any of the subsequent tests.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.688
Which brings us to now.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.565
I read some of your articles.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.026
There were a lot of them.

35:55.946 --> 35:58.781
1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal.

35:59.741 --> 36:04.078
You radiated babies, just like that.
No forms, no questions, nothing.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.872
Who knows how many cancers
you caused?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.290
I don't know.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.210
But what I do know is,
we discovered techniques that

36:11.336 --> 36:15.714
prevent fatal kidney failures
in hundreds of thousands of other kids.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.383
You're not sorry.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.426
I don't regret what I did.

36:19.553 --> 36:24.348
Informed consent, patient rights...
Holds back research.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.230
What the hell are you doing?

36:31.356 --> 36:34.400
Informed consent
is holding back our diagnosis.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.777
Good for you.

36:38.321 --> 36:42.950
Finally standing up for something.
Acting on what you believe.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.876
Dr. House? Hi. How are you?

36:52.002 --> 36:53.919
Not as good as you think I am.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.422
Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
My dad just lost his medicine.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.215
I needed to come back
for another prescription.

36:58.341 --> 36:59.800
Yeah, right.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.635
He's moving it
on the street, isn't he?

37:01.761 --> 37:04.555
Yeah, my dad,
the meth kingpin.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.643
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

37:10.937 --> 37:13.856
I plan to
in a couple of years.

37:14.316 --> 37:17.818
I was just calling to say thank you
and to tell you how impressed I was.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.737
You diagnosed my dad
by just looking at him.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.489
I felt his glands, too.

37:24.826 --> 37:27.328
Well, there's my dad.
I've got to go.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.163
Yeah, me, too.

37:29.289 --> 37:33.083
And, you really don't have to wait
a couple of years to return my calls.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.794
Just six months,
till I turn 18.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.100
It's not Kawasaki's either.
What's next?

37:50.226 --> 37:51.477
Congo red.

37:51.853 --> 37:52.937
Amyloidosis?

37:53.063 --> 37:55.022
What the hell else
would I mean by Congo red?

37:55.148 --> 37:56.106
It's not on the list.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.650
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.778
An abnormal protein is building up
inside the cells of his body,

38:00.904 --> 38:03.238
shutting down his organs one by one.
It explains everything.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.991
The infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow, kidney failure.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.703
We rejected amyloidosis because it
didn't fit the first symptom we found.

38:09.829 --> 38:10.955
- It would affect his heart.
- It did.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.247
It wasn't on the stress test.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.083
We didn't push him
hard enough.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.669
Add the stain
and let's find out.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.713
Congo red added.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.384
Change the polarization
of the light already.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.477
That means
it should be treatable.

38:33.895 --> 38:34.937
How the hell did you
pull that out of...

38:35.105 --> 38:37.356
Not out of mine.
I had a muse.

38:39.943 --> 38:44.905
Oh, God. Protein type AA.

39:02.716 --> 39:03.882
Dr. House...

39:04.009 --> 39:05.509
You have amyloidosis.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.722
It's in your lungs, kidneys,
bone marrow and brain.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.642
Why should I believe you now?

39:18.356 --> 39:22.109
If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you
the sub-type is AA.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.863
It's terminal.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.742
Congratulations.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.038
You got your answer.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.134
Ezra Powell
passed away last night.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.469
I'm sure you already
knew about that.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.555
No, I just got in.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.306
The nurse charted at 2:00 a.m.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.934
He was stable,
breathing labored but regular.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.688
Then, at 2:30, he suddenly stopped.
You know anything about that?

41:22.814 --> 41:25.691
If I did, would you
really want to know?

42:39.724 --> 42:41.266
I'm proud of you.
