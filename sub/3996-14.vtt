WEBVTT

00:01.782 --> 00:02.849
Oh! Oh!

00:07.838 --> 00:08.804
L'Chaim.

00:09.156 --> 00:11.174
To humping.

00:12.225 --> 00:13.360
I was like a river.

00:13.444 --> 00:14.943
Did you feel that?
Did you feel me sweeping you

00:15.012 --> 00:17.147
along with the
current of my body?

00:17.198 --> 00:19.032
You were like a canoe
on my body river.

00:20.551 --> 00:22.535
Like you'd ever be
seaworthy with those breasts.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.237
Boobies.

00:24.322 --> 00:26.373
I wish there was
a word that meant

00:26.457 --> 00:29.626
complete satisfaction
and complete self-loathing.

00:29.693 --> 00:32.628
I've never seen a woman bite
her own shoulder before.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.081
That was the last time.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.532
You said that twice last night.

00:37.584 --> 00:38.001
You'll be back.

00:38.052 --> 00:39.419
I'm like your
black tar heroin.

00:39.503 --> 00:42.072
You just need that sweet taste
in your veins.

00:42.139 --> 00:44.874
Schmidttle and
the damage done.

00:45.675 --> 00:46.810
Neil Young, yo.

00:49.430 --> 00:52.215
Just get me out of here
without someone seeing.

00:55.486 --> 00:56.569
Schmidt?

01:01.023 --> 01:02.408
Oh,

01:03.092 --> 01:04.444
did you have a
sexual guest?

01:04.528 --> 01:05.779
- What?
- Was it

01:05.863 --> 01:07.247
the same girl
from the other night?

01:08.331 --> 01:09.415
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It is!

01:09.416 --> 01:11.832
Oh, my God. You slept with the same
girl twice in a row?

01:11.836 --> 01:14.287
Was it a mistake? Was she
wearing some kind of disguise?

01:14.372 --> 01:17.706
Hey, Nick, Schmidt slept with
the same girl twice in a row.

01:17.757 --> 01:18.758
I owe you five dollars.

01:18.843 --> 01:21.678
You know, I thought I heard
the door open at 3:00 a.m.

01:21.745 --> 01:23.746
Those are the sounds
of true love.

01:23.798 --> 01:25.632
- Bet she had the time of her life.
- What happened?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.200
Did I miss her?

01:27.367 --> 01:28.384
- You did.
- Man, I love meeting

01:28.385 --> 01:29.302
the girls you bring home.

01:29.387 --> 01:30.520
I like to pretend
like I'm your lover

01:30.587 --> 01:32.922
on the down-low,
Theodore K. Mullins.

01:33.673 --> 01:35.925
Damn, Schmidt, in our bed?

01:36.476 --> 01:37.593
Where we shave each other?

01:38.145 --> 01:38.928
I've always

01:38.979 --> 01:41.231
loved you,
you're my boo.

01:41.282 --> 01:42.399
Theodore K. Mullins
is not my type, man.

01:42.466 --> 01:43.900
So, you gonna
three-peat this ho?

01:43.951 --> 01:45.719
Who is this bitch?
We want to meet her.

01:45.786 --> 01:48.471
I'm not gonna parade her
around like some trophy.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.707
You know me,
I'm not that kind of guy.

01:51.775 --> 01:52.876
Oh!

01:52.943 --> 01:54.777
Schmidt told me this
was the front door?

01:56.897 --> 01:58.581
What's wrong with her?
Does she have a hunchback?

01:58.632 --> 01:59.382
Dwarf parts?

01:59.450 --> 02:00.300
Lovitz body?

02:00.384 --> 02:03.670
She happens to be
an incredibly beautiful woman.

02:03.754 --> 02:05.004
She another one
of your heavy gingers, Schmidt?

02:05.089 --> 02:06.956
- How big are her knuckles?
- Butter body?

02:07.007 --> 02:09.476
She has a Hitler moustache.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.179
I'm sorry, just,

02:13.764 --> 02:15.265
like, I want to banter
with you guys in the morning.

02:15.316 --> 02:16.933
I just, like, panicked,
and I made a Hitler joke.

02:16.984 --> 02:17.901
I'm sorry.

03:17.378 --> 03:19.195
Oh, no, Nathaniel, what's wrong?

03:19.246 --> 03:20.713
In the cafeteria,

03:20.798 --> 03:23.082
kids have started playing
this game, coin slot.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.651
They put pennies
in my butt crack.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.304
I made 46 cents.

03:28.372 --> 03:30.206
No, no, no,
you earned that.

03:32.259 --> 03:33.209
Um,

03:33.760 --> 03:35.227
Nathaniel,
I'm gonna help you out.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.799
Julia sent me a cactus.

03:41.235 --> 03:42.519
She's on a business trip
to China,

03:42.586 --> 03:44.437
and she sent it to me
out of the blue.

03:47.973 --> 03:48.975
I'm not an idiot.

03:49.476 --> 03:51.060
She's gonna break up with me.

03:51.111 --> 03:52.996
Who told you that?

03:53.713 --> 03:55.081
Did the cactus tell you that?

03:55.549 --> 03:57.333
Is this one of those
fortune-telling cactuses...

03:57.401 --> 03:59.669
Winston, think.
She's gonna break up with me.

03:59.736 --> 04:02.071
She doesn't think I can
take care of a regular plant.

04:02.872 --> 04:03.973
Well, you can't.

04:11.515 --> 04:13.683
Any idiot can take care
of a cactus, Winston.

04:13.751 --> 04:14.851
She thinks I'm an idiot.

04:15.418 --> 04:16.386
Why are you watering a cactus?

04:16.437 --> 04:17.437
Because I'm an idiot.

04:17.521 --> 04:19.606
Julia sent him a cactus,

04:19.690 --> 04:20.723
which means
she's gonna break up with him.

04:22.476 --> 04:23.593
Hm.

04:23.644 --> 04:25.395
I'm sorry, I thought
that was a joke

04:25.446 --> 04:27.363
because otherwise that would
be totally stupid and insane.

04:27.931 --> 04:29.032
Snap out of it, son.

04:29.099 --> 04:30.233
Jess, you don't get it.

04:30.284 --> 04:33.119
This cactus is like a symbol

04:33.203 --> 04:34.988
of my relationship with her.

04:35.072 --> 04:36.539
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

04:40.493 --> 04:41.711
I'm not gonna quit on this.

04:42.278 --> 04:43.479
I'm gonna get her back.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.300
There it is.

04:47.384 --> 04:48.718
Look at that.

04:48.785 --> 04:51.554
Not bad, just fix red eye,
red eye,

04:52.122 --> 04:53.139
red eye.

04:53.723 --> 04:54.957
Send.

Hello?

Where are you?

Oh, hey, Cecilia,

05:00.180 --> 05:02.432
Did you get my junk mail?

05:02.483 --> 05:04.233
I'm in front of your loft.

05:04.301 --> 05:06.419
I know I said that last time
was the last time,

05:06.487 --> 05:09.472
but... you want to come down?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.608
Yeah, I want to co...

05:11.659 --> 05:12.992
Yeah, I'll come down,
that sounds good.

05:13.577 --> 05:14.543
All right.

05:16.864 --> 05:18.998
So, I think I changed
a life today, you guys.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.917
I pulled a Gandhi,
a real Gandhi.

05:20.984 --> 05:22.669
There's a student of mine,

05:22.753 --> 05:24.487
he's been bullied for
the past few months,

05:24.538 --> 05:26.289
so after warning the kids
that there would be

05:26.340 --> 05:28.491
serious repercussions
if this continued,

05:28.542 --> 05:31.294
I delivered a lesson
in the key of learning.

05:32.546 --> 05:35.098
Learning minor.

06:00.690 --> 06:03.076
You think singing a song
about a kid

06:03.160 --> 06:05.461
is gonna stop him
from getting his ass kicked?

06:05.529 --> 06:08.414
I know 12-year-olds are vicious,
vengeful creatures.

06:08.499 --> 06:09.866
Middle-school girls

06:09.933 --> 06:11.718
literally scalp each other.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.053
I spent most of sixth grade
with a bald spot on my head.

06:14.638 --> 06:15.538
- What?
- But don't tell me

06:15.589 --> 06:16.839
music can't make a difference,

06:17.307 --> 06:18.007
'cause it can.

06:18.058 --> 06:19.542
Those kids were videotaping me

06:19.593 --> 06:20.760
- on their cell phones.
- Right.

06:20.844 --> 06:22.061
I think these kids
are gonna really

06:22.146 --> 06:23.546
- remember that.
- Yeah, um,

06:23.597 --> 06:24.880
- You know, this day.
- What's the song called?

06:24.932 --> 06:26.566
Um, "Sad Sparrow"

06:26.650 --> 06:29.569

They're making fun of me.

06:50.557 --> 06:52.041
The hawk just took
a little poop on you.

06:52.092 --> 06:53.559
I'm not proud of myself
for saying this,

06:53.644 --> 06:55.228
but it's a really funny video.

Why can't we just go upstairs
for a little Schmidt and Spin?

07:05.643 --> 07:07.610
You just said that everybody's
upstairs in the living room.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.928
Okay, fine, what
about your place?

07:08.979 --> 07:10.280
My place is not
an option right now.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.898
All the models are there.

07:11.949 --> 07:13.733
It's 12 models in two rooms.

07:13.784 --> 07:15.268
It's like a room full
of hungry Russians.

07:15.319 --> 07:17.487
Uh, yes, please,
let's go there.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.989
What about just a little good,
old-fashioned car sex?

07:20.074 --> 07:21.541
I can't do any
of my moves in there.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.293
I like to improvise
with my body.

07:23.377 --> 07:24.878
I'm like a sexual snowflake.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.330
Each night with me is a
unique experience, Cece.

07:27.415 --> 07:29.615
Okay, are we gonna do this,
or not?

07:29.667 --> 07:32.135
'Cause I kind of need this
to happen right now, okay?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.920
Isn't there, like,
a Starbucks bathroom around here

07:33.971 --> 07:35.305
or something we could use?

07:35.389 --> 07:37.657
What do I look like,
a Gypsy courtesan?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.142
So, how hard are
you gonna drop

07:39.226 --> 07:40.894
the hammer on the kid
who did this?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.430
I'm gonna find this kid,
and I'm just gonna...

07:43.481 --> 07:45.064
open up a dialogue.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.483
Not gonna work.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.817
Take it from me,
I used to be a bully.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.635
Ow!

07:50.187 --> 07:51.554
Brown lightning!

07:51.622 --> 07:53.907
Wow, you had a catchphrase?
Yeah.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.158
You got to hit them
where it hurts.

07:55.226 --> 07:56.142
Thank you, Winston,

07:56.193 --> 07:57.310
but I have a different approach.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.095
Jerk-sica?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.281
My last name rhymes
with "gay,"

08:01.832 --> 08:04.584
and the best thing
you can think of is Jerk-sica?

08:05.352 --> 08:06.318
Reason.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.089
Hey, Schmidt.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.508
Oh, there is?
Thank you.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.327
He says we should look
out the window.

08:14.378 --> 08:15.762
There's a crescent moon
out tonight.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.713
Oh, dip, seriously?

08:24.305 --> 08:26.306
Why do we care
about a crescent moon?

08:27.657 --> 08:28.608
I don't know.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.028
I'm gonna live
up there someday.

08:34.231 --> 08:36.533
Hey, Julia, what's up, girl?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.201
Hope you're having
a great time in Beijing.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.785
I miss you;
I can't wait to see you.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.787
I got the cactus.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.822
Thank you so much.

08:42.873 --> 08:44.407
I'm taking great care of it.

08:44.492 --> 08:45.708
Yeah, things are doing
good here.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.877
Everything's really cool,
just...

08:48.962 --> 08:51.548
taking names, kicking butt,
you know, all that.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.999
So, great,
I'll see you Wednesday.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.051
You're the best around.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.003
Nope, that's not gonna
be the one.

08:57.054 --> 08:59.889
Hey, Julia, just calling back
to say that I get it.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.140
Message received.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.959
I'm the cactus.

09:03.027 --> 09:04.177
If you put me in the desert,

09:04.228 --> 09:05.512
I'll grow some needles, too.

09:05.563 --> 09:06.712
You bet I would.

09:07.264 --> 09:08.314
You bet
I would.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.233
FYI, I'm not high right now.

09:10.301 --> 09:11.985
Julia!

09:12.752 --> 09:13.319
Julia!

09:13.387 --> 09:15.188
Call me back.

09:15.239 --> 09:16.906
Call me back, Julia.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.775
Julia, it's Nick.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.361
I'm sorry, I just realized
about the time difference.

09:21.412 --> 09:22.895
So, if you get this one first,

09:22.947 --> 09:25.031
could you please just delete
the other ones?

09:25.082 --> 09:26.249
I love you.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.284
What did I jus...?

09:30.020 --> 09:31.304
I don't hear anyone out there.

09:31.372 --> 09:32.605
I think I'm safe.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.507
And I-I want you to know,

09:34.575 --> 09:36.175
that was the last time, okay?

09:36.993 --> 09:37.961
This is over.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.179
But we haven't even gotten
to the cheese course.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.233
A little sharp
aged cheddar? Mm-hmm.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.285
Manchego?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.120
Maybe some buttery Gruyère?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.888
You sure you want
to miss out?

09:48.939 --> 09:50.356
I just want to...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.758
slowly peel the wax
off your Babybels.

09:52.810 --> 09:55.728
What are you even saying?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.597
How about a little
stinky Taleggio?

09:57.648 --> 09:59.449
Why is this working?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.818
I am so turned on
right now.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.453
Or maybe some
cream cheese?

10:03.537 --> 10:04.954
Want some schmear, Cece?

10:05.722 --> 10:06.439
You know what?

10:06.490 --> 10:07.607
Cece, you should go.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.075
Because if you have the strength

10:09.126 --> 10:11.127
to turn all this down,

10:12.711 --> 10:13.546
do it.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.283
Yeah, I'm good.

10:20.938 --> 10:24.957
Hi. Who do I speak to
re: getting something removed

10:24.958 --> 10:26.459
from the Internet?

10:27.010 --> 10:27.727
Yeah, I can hold.

10:32.316 --> 10:33.666
Want to party with Havarti?

10:34.734 --> 10:35.602
Fine.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.904
Give me the damn cheese.

10:48.698 --> 10:49.716
So, Brianna,

10:49.783 --> 10:51.167
I saw the robot arm

10:51.251 --> 10:52.452
in the user profile,

10:52.503 --> 10:54.020
so I know you
made that video.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.872
So I thought we could sit
and talk for a minute.

11:00.294 --> 11:02.161
Look, Brianna, I know
you're better than this.

11:03.213 --> 11:04.664
Can we talk about you
for a few minutes?

11:06.215 --> 11:07.934
Can we talk about you instead?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.719
I'm an open book;
Ask me anything.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.970
How come you don't have
a boyfriend?

11:12.038 --> 11:13.523
And why did Mr. Genzlinger
dump you?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.142
And is it true that
your boyfriend before that

11:16.193 --> 11:16.859
cheated on you?

11:17.427 --> 11:18.361
Are you barren, Miss Day?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.580
And why is your voice
so deep like a man's?

11:20.648 --> 11:22.365
- It's no... it's not.
- Your happiness

11:22.449 --> 11:23.733
seems like a mask.

11:25.067 --> 11:25.851
Well, I better go.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.549
What have I done?

11:41.918 --> 11:42.885
<i>Julia! Welcome home!</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:45.603
Hey.

11:46.154 --> 11:46.988
Are you okay?

11:47.072 --> 11:48.573
Yes, I'm okay;
Welcome back.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.275
- Are you sure?
- Did you listen to all the messages?

11:50.326 --> 11:52.327
- I did.
- You did? That sucks.

11:52.394 --> 11:53.578
You know, I really
didn't mean anything.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.829
- I know.
- I-I didn't.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.114
Look, I got in
my head, Julia,

11:56.165 --> 11:57.865
I thought you sent
me this cactus

11:57.950 --> 11:59.417
because you were
trying to tell me

11:59.484 --> 12:01.185
that I can't take care
of a normal plant.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.705
Which, when I think about
it, I probably can't.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.523
Plants freak me out.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.792
I'm way better with
babies, actually.

12:07.843 --> 12:08.794
Hmm.

12:09.343 --> 12:10.094
Not that I want to have, like,

12:10.162 --> 12:11.495
a baby with you,
like, right now.

12:11.547 --> 12:13.097
- I can see us having babies.
- Please, can we not...

12:13.165 --> 12:15.049
- I know, that's not what I mean to say.
- No, come on...

12:15.134 --> 12:16.851
- I'm getting weird again. What I mean
to say, - No, Nick, I need to say...

12:16.936 --> 12:18.136
Julia, please, I overreacted.

12:18.687 --> 12:20.104
I think we should break up.

12:22.973 --> 12:28.046
I do. I mean, I didn't realize it
when I sent it...

12:28.863 --> 12:31.816
but then after listening
to the seven...

12:32.567 --> 12:33.234
Yeah, I know.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.652
...Seven, Nick,

12:34.720 --> 12:36.154
- Seven, yeah.
- Separate voice mails

12:36.205 --> 12:37.872
about the meaning
behind the cactus,

12:38.457 --> 12:41.659
I don't know, it really
just clicked in for me,

12:41.710 --> 12:44.195
and I just, I don't think
that we should do this any more.

12:44.246 --> 12:45.797
I'm really sorry.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.390
So I was right
about the cactus.

12:57.609 --> 13:00.378
Okay, what kind of crazy person
destroys a child's robot?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.897
Can you bring me, like, a bunch
of Phillips head screwdrivers

13:02.982 --> 13:07.151
and, like, a Crescent wrench
and, like, other tool things?

13:07.219 --> 13:08.403
What if I'm busy?

13:10.906 --> 13:11.973
Thank you, Winston.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.508
I really needed that.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.043
It's been a really hard week.

13:15.110 --> 13:16.694
Hey, man,
I'm going to the beach

13:16.745 --> 13:19.047
to watch the sun go down,
'cause I love sunsets.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.531
Did you know that about me?

13:21.099 --> 13:22.917
What the hell is wrong with you?

13:23.002 --> 13:27.121
Oh, Julia dumped me,
so sad face.

13:28.206 --> 13:29.841
Hey, do you want
to come with me to the beach?

13:29.908 --> 13:31.292
'Cause I feel great,
I'm ready to rock,

13:31.377 --> 13:32.743
but I really don't
want to be alone.

13:35.246 --> 13:36.047
Scissors?

13:36.098 --> 13:38.599
How am I supposed to fix
a robot arm with scissors?

13:38.684 --> 13:39.550
Those are my
good scissors.

13:39.601 --> 13:40.752
Why do you have good scissors?

13:40.803 --> 13:44.355
You know, the news
only focuses on what goes wrong.

13:44.423 --> 13:45.890
Never talks about
what goes right.

13:45.941 --> 13:47.108
Evolution.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.109
- That's it. Come here.
- You know?

13:48.193 --> 13:49.644
Yeah, exactly.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.063
I'm gonna kill him.
Can you get him out of here?

13:52.114 --> 13:54.949
Hey, guys, you guys want
to watch <i>The Piano</i> later?

13:56.651 --> 13:57.869
Here?

13:57.936 --> 13:59.770
You want to do it here?

13:59.822 --> 14:01.906
Okay... all right.
What's the scenario?

14:01.957 --> 14:04.375
We enter separately,
pretending to be strangers

14:04.443 --> 14:05.910
meeting in the bathroom.

14:05.961 --> 14:08.046
You want me on the can,
off the can?

14:08.113 --> 14:09.464
No, I just, I
just need to

14:09.548 --> 14:10.832
pop in this party
for, like, 20 minutes.

14:10.916 --> 14:11.999
When I come back,
we'll have sex.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.551
Okay, yeah, let's do it.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.336
Oh, no. Um, I'm going
in there alone.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.588
Well, what am I supposed to do?

14:17.639 --> 14:18.673
I'll crack a window for you.

14:18.757 --> 14:21.008
Crack a window for me?

14:21.093 --> 14:22.510
- Yeah.
- What am I, your sex dog?

14:22.594 --> 14:24.429
What... what if I have to go
to the bathroom?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.230
Why don't you just
give me a chew toy.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.399
Come on, Schmidt, stop
being such a big baby.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.169
Oh, my... Are you ashamed of me?

14:31.236 --> 14:33.104
Yes. Absolutely.

14:33.155 --> 14:35.690
100%. I'm 100%
ashamed of you.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.992
What-what a revelation.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.811
Okay, come on, Schmidt, I
can't be the first woman

14:40.863 --> 14:42.346
who's ashamed
to be with you.

14:43.414 --> 14:45.867
Okay, look,
I won't go into your party,

14:45.951 --> 14:47.635
if...

14:47.703 --> 14:50.254
if you go to breakfast
with me tomorrow.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.923
In public.

14:52.990 --> 14:53.908
Yeah, okay.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.959
Oh, really?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.294
Really.

14:56.345 --> 14:57.678
I mean, I can
survive breakfast.

15:00.007 --> 15:01.516
I'll be back soon.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.602
Hey, Wendy.
How's it going?

15:19.367 --> 15:20.034
I hope it works.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.019
I didn't get a chance
to test it.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.071
Even broken, it's
still got a shot at top prize.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.740
I mean, have you seen
some of this crap?

15:25.824 --> 15:27.875
"What can old
people do?"

15:27.960 --> 15:29.877
"Does it taste better
with hot sauce?"

15:29.962 --> 15:31.162
My friends.

15:31.213 --> 15:32.380
Guess what I
just learned.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.714
What's inside of a pumpkin.

15:34.549 --> 15:35.866
Apparently, a lot.

15:35.918 --> 15:37.051
I didn't know.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.054
Whoa!

15:40.639 --> 15:42.223
Winston, you have to
get him out of here.

15:42.307 --> 15:43.724
You see him, he's
about to blow.

15:43.809 --> 15:44.892
I'm not having him
by himself right now.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.093
There's Brianna.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.881
Hi, Brianna.

15:50.933 --> 15:53.017
You must be
Brianna's moms.

15:53.068 --> 15:54.218
I'm Miss Day.

15:54.269 --> 15:55.520
Right. The singer.

15:55.571 --> 15:57.054
You're the one
who sings.

15:57.105 --> 15:59.607
This is Brianna's project,
a robotic arm.

15:59.675 --> 16:01.075
Start it up, Brianna.

16:07.966 --> 16:10.501
And a project bursts
into flames.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.537
Brianna, what happened?

16:12.588 --> 16:14.405
Someone must have
sabotaged it.

16:16.074 --> 16:18.426
Bet it was Nathaniel.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.628
Hey! Get my scissors
out of your mouth!

16:20.712 --> 16:21.912
What is wrong
with you?!

16:23.549 --> 16:24.882
He's been creating problems
for our daughter.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.250
What are you gonna
do about it?

16:26.301 --> 16:27.518
Nathaniel, come over here.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.688
Um, actually, uh...

16:31.807 --> 16:33.307
...this is my fault.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.977
I sabotaged the science project.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.528
- You did what?
- What?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.197
And it was
totally unprofessional.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.098
And I'm sorry,

16:41.149 --> 16:44.202
but your daughter is--
how do I put this?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.904
Brianna is difficult.

16:46.955 --> 16:49.323
Difficult? You're the one
that sabotaged her project.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.491
You daughter sucks.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.609
Okay, she is
a demon seed,

16:51.660 --> 16:53.611
she is the
spawn of Satan.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.580
And I do believe I speak
for the entire human race

16:55.631 --> 16:59.333
when I say that people like her
should not be building robots.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.718
Who are you?

17:00.785 --> 17:02.920
Brown lightning.

17:02.971 --> 17:04.454
I want her disciplined.

17:04.506 --> 17:06.140
No! No!

17:06.224 --> 17:08.092
- Wonderful.
- Hey, no.

17:08.143 --> 17:09.393
No.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.561
Why can't we all just

17:11.630 --> 17:13.130
love each other, right?

17:14.433 --> 17:15.433
What are you doing?

17:15.483 --> 17:17.734
Want a science project?

17:17.801 --> 17:20.905
How about this as a science
project: love is a myth.

17:20.972 --> 17:22.272
Why is this Earth

17:22.324 --> 17:24.242
so big and I am so small?

17:26.328 --> 17:28.112
So, yay, Earth.

17:28.163 --> 17:30.915
Be optimistic? Learn?

17:30.982 --> 17:32.617
We're all gonna die alone, so...

17:38.173 --> 17:39.373
- My office, 9:00 a.m.
- How embarrassing.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.758
I was right about the cactus.

17:46.212 --> 17:50.049
I assure you, I'll be watching
Miss Day very closely.

17:51.501 --> 17:52.985
Hey.

17:53.552 --> 17:54.485
Hi.

17:56.905 --> 17:59.107
I am so sorry, Tanya.

17:59.191 --> 18:00.558
Don't be.

18:00.609 --> 18:01.493
I love it!

18:01.560 --> 18:03.995
Jess, you're a
real teacher now.

18:04.063 --> 18:04.863
What?

18:04.914 --> 18:05.997
You're a kid hater.

18:06.065 --> 18:07.449
You're one of us.

18:07.533 --> 18:10.001
Come here. Welcome.

18:10.069 --> 18:12.070
I'm-I'm not a kid hater.

18:14.239 --> 18:16.291
That's right.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.910
None of us are.

18:20.263 --> 18:21.379
Hey, Brianna.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.715
Can I speak to you?

18:25.266 --> 18:26.250
Look,

18:26.302 --> 18:28.053
I know I'm not your
favorite teacher.

18:28.104 --> 18:29.271
You don't like my style.

18:29.355 --> 18:31.473
That's fine.

18:31.557 --> 18:33.308
But I'm not gonna
change who I am,

18:33.392 --> 18:34.893
so you're just gonna
have to deal with it

18:34.944 --> 18:36.778
and respect it.

18:36.862 --> 18:38.613
Also, you're gonna
take this paper,

18:38.698 --> 18:40.365
and you're gonna
sing a duet with me.

18:40.932 --> 18:41.650
What?!

18:41.651 --> 18:42.600
Oh, yeah.

18:42.652 --> 18:43.818
Everybody, settle down.

18:45.403 --> 18:46.537
Camera phones are encouraged.

18:46.605 --> 18:47.372
No.

18:47.439 --> 18:49.374
One, two, three, four.

18:49.941 --> 18:51.276
You really
don't want to be seen

18:51.277 --> 18:53.395
having breakfast
with me, do you?

18:53.462 --> 18:54.996
Are we even still in L.A.?

18:55.081 --> 18:57.799
Schmidt, you and I
are not together.

18:57.883 --> 19:00.218
We're not in a relationship.

19:00.285 --> 19:01.953
- We're just having sex.
- And I love it.

19:02.005 --> 19:05.273
And I'm not gonna be a prize
that you get to show off.

19:08.728 --> 19:12.463
Look, guys are always
just showing me off,

19:12.515 --> 19:14.232
and I hate it.

19:14.299 --> 19:18.186
Look, I... I want to tell people

19:18.270 --> 19:22.107
because I think
that you are the dopest,

19:22.158 --> 19:23.575
flyest...

19:25.644 --> 19:29.364
...smartest, ballsiest,
bitchiest,

19:29.448 --> 19:31.416
truly terrifying woman

19:31.983 --> 19:33.418
that I have

19:33.485 --> 19:36.204
sexually enjoyed
in a really long time.

19:41.677 --> 19:43.628
Do you want
to tell the waitress?

19:43.679 --> 19:45.547
Uh, if I could have
everyone's attention.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.115
Real quick, if
you could, uh...

19:47.183 --> 19:49.784
Hey, guys, call a time-out
to whatever-whatever-

19:49.852 --> 19:51.820
whatever that thing is.
Okay, great.

19:51.887 --> 19:55.273
I am having sex
with this woman right here.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.175
You want to stand up?

19:57.226 --> 19:59.110
No. Okay, you don't want to do it?
All right, great.

19:59.178 --> 20:01.846
I'm enjoying myself
im-immensely.

20:01.897 --> 20:03.281
Uh, it's, you know,

20:03.348 --> 20:04.532
a physical thing,
but I am definitely,

20:04.600 --> 20:07.619
for real having sex

20:07.686 --> 20:11.906
with this girl right here,
to completion.

20:15.577 --> 20:16.911
Parkour!

20:16.996 --> 20:18.012
Hit it!

20:18.080 --> 20:19.614
Down! Hit it!

20:19.682 --> 20:21.466
Down! Hit it!

20:22.601 --> 20:24.436
Yeah.

20:28.090 --> 20:29.974
Hey.

20:32.428 --> 20:34.396
I got you a real plant.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.981
Yeah, I don't want it, Jess;
I'll just kill it.

20:37.049 --> 20:38.683
I know.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.384
You're a plant killer.

20:40.436 --> 20:42.187
And I write songs.

20:42.238 --> 20:44.155
We're weirdos.

20:44.223 --> 20:46.191
But that's who we are.

20:46.242 --> 20:47.692
And that's fine.

20:47.743 --> 20:49.560
And you have
a giant cactus needle

20:49.612 --> 20:51.062
sticking out of your face.

20:51.113 --> 20:53.698
What? Where is it?

20:53.749 --> 20:56.367
Can you get it out?
Get it out. Ow.

20:56.435 --> 20:59.904
♪ So it's time
we all make a change ♪

20:59.955 --> 21:02.774
♪ Find somewhere else
for our loose change ♪

21:02.842 --> 21:05.543
The song is called "Let Me
Lift You Up With My Robot Arm"?

21:05.611 --> 21:07.996
- Yeah.
- It's catchy.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.881
I mean, the title is flawed,
there's no question about that.

21:09.949 --> 21:12.717
But you are kicking ass
with the comments.

21:12.784 --> 21:14.035
Look at this.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.970
"This teacher is <i>muy caliente."</i>

21:16.055 --> 21:17.989
- Hot, hot, hot.
- "I'd like to grade her on a curve."

21:18.557 --> 21:19.388
Yep.

21:19.392 --> 21:21.276
"Finally, entertainment
that doesn't

21:21.343 --> 21:22.711
resort to salty language."

21:22.779 --> 21:24.979
Finally.

21:25.047 --> 21:27.398
Jess, these commenters
are all you, aren't they?

21:27.466 --> 21:28.799
Yes. Yes, they are.
