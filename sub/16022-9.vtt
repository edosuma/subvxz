WEBVTT

00:07.207 --> 00:09.274
(tv playing, man speaking
indistinctly)

00:17.017 --> 00:19.451
(motorcycle revs in distance,
phone line rings)

00:19.453 --> 00:21.520
Woman: <i>911 operator.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.389
(siren wails)
man:
<i>I'm at the sky view motel.</i>

00:23.391 --> 00:25.657
<i>I was making a delivery.</i>
<i>You have to send someone.</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:27.659
<i>I think they're dead.</i>
<i>I don't know for sure, but...</i>
<i>Slow down, sir.</i>

00:27.661 --> 00:29.128
<i>You need to tell me</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

00:29.130 --> 00:31.797
Man: <i>There's blood.</i>
<i>There's blood everywhere.</i>

00:31.799 --> 00:34.266
(siren chirps)

00:34.268 --> 00:36.268
(sighs wearily)
well, it's a messy one.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.103
If you don't believe me,
ask the pizza

00:38.105 --> 00:39.471
Delivery guy there.
Stokes:
Yeah, is he the one

00:39.473 --> 00:41.407
Who called it in?
Yeah, he was
delivering pizzas

00:41.409 --> 00:43.609
To, uh, one of
the rooms nearby.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.445
The door to 114 was ajar,
so he looked in.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.580
What do we have?
Two victims.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.250
Mr. And mrs. Smith.
Oh, that's original.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.651
Anybody know
who they really are?

00:52.653 --> 00:54.286
No.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.388
And I don't know what
they did to deserve this.

01:11.438 --> 01:15.641
Phillips:
...63... 64... 65...

01:15.643 --> 01:18.410
66, 67...

01:18.412 --> 01:22.414
68... 69... 70...

01:22.416 --> 01:23.749
71, 72...
Stokes:
Talk to me, david.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.286
I'm trying to determine
the number of stab wounds.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.588
But, frankly, there are
just too many to count.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.225
Finlay:
This is disturbing.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.197
Stokes:
Hey, wait a minute.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.499
You know something?
I've been here.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.669
Yeah, we had that od out
on the street a while back.
Yeah, yeah,

01:43.671 --> 01:46.338
In the motel, but I mean,
in this room-- this exact one.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.506
I-I've been here.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.142
Room 114.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.444
I remember the view of the neon
from that window.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.546
This is it.
You're right.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.249
We have been here before.
Yeah, it was

01:57.251 --> 01:59.551
A dismemberment murder;
victim was in his 20s.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.221
It was about, uh,
two months ago.
No, I think it was more recent.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.157
It was another couple,
but the woman was bludgeoned...

02:05.159 --> 02:08.393
I am pretty sure
it was the dismemberment.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.628
I'm sorry,
but-but you're both right.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.430
I've been here twice before,

02:11.432 --> 02:14.533
Once for the dismemberment
and again for the couple.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.401
And now this.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.671
Anybody else getting a really
bad feeling about this place?

02:19.673 --> 02:23.642
Yeah... Yeah, this the world's
most unlucky motel room.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.385
♪ who... Are you?

02:33.387 --> 02:36.488
♪ who, who, who, who?

02:36.490 --> 02:39.491

02:39.493 --> 02:40.859

02:40.861 --> 02:43.395
♪ I really wanna know

02:43.397 --> 02:45.764

02:45.766 --> 02:47.466

♪ <i>who...</i> ♪

02:47.468 --> 02:51.336
♪ come on, tell me who are you,

02:51.338 --> 02:54.439
♪ are you!

03:01.314 --> 03:03.448
(indistinct radio communication,
siren wailing in distance)

03:15.595 --> 03:17.896
All right,
that's three murder scenes

03:17.898 --> 03:19.898
All in the same spot.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.733
They got to be related,
don't you think?

03:21.735 --> 03:24.570
Maybe there's a connection
between the victims

03:24.572 --> 03:27.406
Or the killer has
a weird fixation of some kind.

03:27.408 --> 03:31.243
I don't think I'm ready to talk
about past crimes yet.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.978
Have to focus on
this one first.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.646
Yeah, I hear you.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.615
I'll take the bathroom.

04:03.009 --> 04:06.578
(man yelling, blade slicing)

04:25.498 --> 04:26.999
(woman screams)

04:28.768 --> 04:31.436
(woman screaming)

04:35.708 --> 04:38.310
Brass: So, how long have
you been manager here?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.445
Uh, since about the time
I learned to walk.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.614
My parents built this place,
so... I grew up here.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.615
Oh!
Yeah.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.883
All mine now.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.785
Do you have any idea
who might've done this?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.821
Isn't that your business
to figure that out?

04:49.823 --> 04:50.989
I mean, I know we're
not the bellagio, but...

04:50.991 --> 04:53.992
If I have to drop
the rates any lower,

04:53.994 --> 04:58.830
Yeah. So, you got about, what,
uh, 20 rooms here?

04:58.832 --> 05:01.366
Tell me about the people
who stay in them.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.302
It's like the sign says.
I mean, by the night,

05:03.304 --> 05:04.970
By the week and by the month.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.338
I'm gonna need a list of names.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.073
Well, that could be a problem.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.341
Not that I wouldn't
give it, it's just...

05:09.343 --> 05:10.375
I don't have it.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.711
Come on, man.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.980
The place is 39 bucks a night.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.515
If people have cash,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.083
What do I care
about their names?

05:18.085 --> 05:21.687
Look, none of 'em are
killers, though-- trust me.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.056
How do you know that?

05:24.058 --> 05:27.392
Well, there's no one here
that interesting.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.480
(liquid sloshing)

06:08.568 --> 06:11.136
Hey, finn!

06:11.138 --> 06:13.071
Looks like the smiths had
a guest last night.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.074
The towels are damp, and I found
a red hair in the shower drain.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.543
Hmm, that doesn't match either
of our victims.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.746
And there were three
toothbrushes around the sink.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.914
Uh, I found
a receipt for one.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.816
It's from the drugstore around
the corner-- last night.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.585
So a guest they didn't plan on.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.653
There's more.
They also bought shampoo

06:28.655 --> 06:30.021
And a pair of scissors,

06:30.023 --> 06:32.691
Which have since disappeared.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.127
Could be the murder weapon.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.963
So there was someone in here
before the killing started.
Yeah, who showered

06:37.965 --> 06:40.432
And-- I don't know-- judging
from the toothbrush,

06:40.434 --> 06:42.434
Might've been planning
on staying the night.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.535
So what went wrong?

06:53.513 --> 06:55.113
I've been doing this
long enough that nothing

06:55.115 --> 06:57.015
Shocks me,
but if a case could...

06:59.051 --> 07:02.487
Just the sheer savagery
involved.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.423
More than a hundred stab wounds
in each victim.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.792
Certainly beyond
what was necessary...

07:06.794 --> 07:09.761
If the goal was
to simply kill them.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.962
Can I see that?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.131
It's, uh, way beyond
what we sometimes see

07:13.133 --> 07:15.200
With crimes of passion
or extreme anger.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.635
This was madness.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.505
Russell: Their names
really were smith.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.773
Robbins:
Richard and ann.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.176
According to family,
they were in from flagstaff

07:24.178 --> 07:26.945
For an antique toy
and collectibles convention.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.080
That would explain
the dolls in the room.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.149
Sounds like they were
solid people.

07:31.151 --> 07:35.454
She volunteered, ran pet therapy
at an old folks home.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.922
He worked with the homeless.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.991
Squeaky clean.

07:39.993 --> 07:45.464
Squeaky-clean have indulged
their dark side here in vegas.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.865
They could've invited
somebody back to the room,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.567
Spice up their life
a little bit.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.170
If so...

07:52.172 --> 07:55.240
Certainly got more
than they bargained for.

07:55.242 --> 07:59.177
Hey. So, I... Pulled the files

07:59.179 --> 08:01.646
For the other two
motel murder scenes.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.814
It's weird, don't you think?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.816
That a killer would fixate
on one room?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.618
What do you think
the significance is?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.719
Why does he feel
the need to kill there?

08:07.721 --> 08:08.920
Well, that's assuming

08:08.922 --> 08:11.523
That these are all the work
of one killer.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.158
It could be
that there's no connection.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.827
That you're looking for patterns
where there are none.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.563
So it's a coincidence that three
totally unrelated killers

08:18.565 --> 08:20.565
Chose this one room?

08:20.567 --> 08:22.200
I'm just saying,
we don't know yet.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.536
All right,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.071
First one: Mark bell.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.572
11 weeks ago,
he stayed

08:27.574 --> 08:31.109
In room 114 after his girlfriend
kicked him out.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.178
Yeah, I remember.
I worked this case with finn.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.647
The maid found him tied
to the bed,

08:35.649 --> 08:38.817
Severe lacerations to his legs.
<i>They were nearly cut off.</i>

08:38.819 --> 08:40.552
<i>He bled to death.</i>

08:40.554 --> 08:42.220
<i>There was a bloody knife</i>
<i>found on the floor.</i>

08:42.222 --> 08:44.556
<i>Too smeared to yield</i>
<i>any viable prints.</i>

08:44.558 --> 08:46.091
<i>Detectives, at the time,</i>

08:46.093 --> 08:48.226
Thought the attack was related
<i>to a drug debt.</i>
<i>(screaming)</i>

08:48.228 --> 08:50.962
<i>They thought the dealer</i>
<i>was sending a message.</i>

08:52.131 --> 08:54.933
Four weeks ago...

08:54.935 --> 08:56.601
Second attack
in the room.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.537
Alex and tina garnez.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.939
Nick and I
handled this one.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.910
<i>Their house</i>
<i>had been foreclosed on.</i>

09:04.912 --> 09:07.112
<i>They were living in their car</i>
<i>for months.</i>

09:07.114 --> 09:09.948
<i>Mr. Garnez finally got a job.</i>

09:09.950 --> 09:12.884
<i>Moving to the motel was</i>
<i>supposed to be a step up.</i>

09:12.886 --> 09:16.221
<i>That night, he was sneaking</i>
<i>a cigarette in the bathroom</i>

09:16.223 --> 09:18.223
<i>While his wife slept.</i>

09:18.225 --> 09:20.225
<i>The killer started</i>
<i>with his wife...</i>

09:23.129 --> 09:25.864
<i>...Clubbing her</i>
<i>while she was sleeping.</i>

09:25.866 --> 09:28.567
<i>Then he must've surprised</i>
<i>mr. Garnez in the bathroom...</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:30.068
No!

09:30.070 --> 09:31.903
<i>Overpowered him.</i>

09:33.873 --> 09:35.941
He survived.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.143
He's still in the hospital
recovering.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.811
And then last night...

09:39.813 --> 09:40.979
The smiths.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.584
(sighs)
still think we're...

09:45.586 --> 09:47.886
Dealing with random,
unrelated events?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.721
Stokes:
<i>All right, finn,</i>

09:49.723 --> 09:51.790
I'll see you back at the lab.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.862
(helicopter hovering)

10:09.308 --> 10:12.677
Come on now. Open up.
I saw you in there.

10:13.646 --> 10:14.746
Hey.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.748
I was asleep last night.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.917
I was not involved.
I already told the cops.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.252
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cool.
I'm not, uh...

10:21.254 --> 10:22.921
I'm not here to grill you.
(chuckles)

10:22.923 --> 10:26.324
Kind of looks like you like
to call this place home.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.693
I'm guessing you see everything
that goes on in here.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.295
You... Didn't see
anything weird?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.330
Anybody suspicious
running around here lately?

10:32.332 --> 10:35.400
It's not my place to judge
another man in that way.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.268
Only god can judge.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.404
Right... Well,
god would want you

10:39.406 --> 10:41.640
To help me catch a
killer, wouldn't he?

10:41.642 --> 10:45.010
Now, sir, please, please,
hey, come on, now.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.680
A couple was violently
murdered last night.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.683
A woman a few weeks ago.
A young man before that.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.885
All in the same room,
all innocent victims.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.722
Innocent? There's no one
on this planet who's innocent.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.291
We're all sinners.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.761
Yeah, yeah, well, that-that

11:02.763 --> 11:04.229
Doesn't really
help me do my job.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.064
They were called to god.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.799
That's god's plan.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.301
Your job is done.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.003
Yeah, I just...

11:15.141 --> 11:17.976
Might be my biggest
regret about this job--

11:17.978 --> 11:21.680
I know way too much
about hotel bedspreads.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.749
And hotel carpets.
Don't go barefoot.
So, we have

11:24.751 --> 11:26.685
Three different bedspreads
from our...

11:26.687 --> 11:27.686
Three different
crime scenes.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.920
I ran the dna.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.689
The bedspread
on the left is

11:30.691 --> 11:32.757
From the very first
murder scene.
I'm guessing

11:32.759 --> 11:34.959
It lived in that room
for who knows how long.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.861
Long enough that I
was able to identify

11:36.863 --> 11:39.130
26 individual
dna profiles.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.732
Whoa.
Yeah. The replacement

11:40.734 --> 11:42.934
Bedspread there was
only in the room

11:42.936 --> 11:44.803
For seven weeks.
So fewer contributions.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.404
16 of them.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.441
And the third bedspread,
from last night's crime scene.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.276
Yielded only
nine contributors.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.445
But here's the thing:
One of them, a male,

11:53.447 --> 11:56.881
Is common
to all three bedspreads.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.417
One person,
the same person was in the room

11:59.419 --> 12:01.052
Before each of the murders?

12:02.288 --> 12:03.922
Have you run the samples
through codis?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.123
It's running
right now.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.994
Here we go.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.731
Randall wicks, 22.
He must have

12:12.733 --> 12:14.232
Just been added
to the system.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.302
There's why-- sexual battery
charge two weeks ago.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.003
Look where he was arrested.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.874
That same motel.
The same room!

12:22.876 --> 12:24.843
I'll call brass,

12:24.845 --> 12:26.845
Get out a broadcast.

12:31.183 --> 12:34.285
Oh, how the mighty have
fallen, huh, randall?

12:34.287 --> 12:37.489
You used to be
the featured dancer
in the tangiers

12:37.491 --> 12:38.790
All male review.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.258
How'd you let that
gig slip away?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.392
I don't know.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.428
I got bored, so I quit.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.831
Well, or maybe you
found something more
interesting to do, huh?

12:49.802 --> 12:51.970
Oh, hey, man, what the hell?
Sanders: Three
separate murders

12:51.972 --> 12:54.205
In the same room at
the sky view motel.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.543
Your dna was found in the room
after each of the crimes.

12:58.545 --> 13:02.280
What? Wait a minute--
sky view motel?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.349
Was that in room 114?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.417
I use that room,
frequently.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.786
For business.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.421
So... You're
a prostitute?

13:10.423 --> 13:13.191
Dude, I'm a stud,
letting frustrated housewives

13:13.193 --> 13:16.261
Get a taste of something
they wouldn't even get
close to otherwise.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.197
Okay, stud, what
about the housewife
you beat up in room 114?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.032
The sexual
battery charge.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.101
Or was that just part of
the pony ride experience?

13:23.103 --> 13:25.103
That was self-defense.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.271
I'm serious.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.307
I was in fear for my life.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.542
Okay...

13:30.544 --> 13:32.544
I meet this woman there, right?

13:32.546 --> 13:34.879
Totally normal at first.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.948
Then we start
getting into it, and...

13:36.950 --> 13:39.317
I don't know,
she goes all crazy.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.319
Starts hallucinating
or something,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.520
Screaming at the walls.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.056
Pure freak show.
Sanders:
And why?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.091
What would make
her do that?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.327
Well, I ain't a doctor
or nothing, but...

13:49.329 --> 13:51.830
Must be the sex
just blew her mind.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.833
Yeah, that must
have been it.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.268
(sighs): Well...
Aside from being

13:57.270 --> 13:59.504
A complete tool,
what do you think?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.472
Well, he still
could be our killer.
Well, the problem is,

14:01.474 --> 14:03.408
All we have is dna evidence,

14:03.410 --> 14:06.544
And we can't disprove his story
of how it got in that room.

14:06.546 --> 14:10.181
Well, we do have an eyewitness
who could possibly I.D. Randall.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.516
Alex garnez, the husband

14:11.518 --> 14:13.384
Who survived his wife
being bludgeoned

14:13.386 --> 14:15.620
Four weeks ago.
He has massive head injuries.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.523
He's still in the hospital--
we don't even know what
condition he's in.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.924
Well, I talked to his doctor.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.160
She said he's struggling
psychologically.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.596
They have him on suicide watch
after one failed attempt,

14:24.598 --> 14:26.898
But... Physically...

14:26.900 --> 14:29.534
She said he's strong
enough to talk to us.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.645
Mr. Garnez.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.513
Um...

14:42.515 --> 14:44.349
I'm csi brody,

14:44.351 --> 14:46.184
And this is

14:46.186 --> 14:47.518
Csi sanders.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.355
I'm sorry,
but we need to talk to you

14:50.357 --> 14:53.124
About the night that
you and your wife were attacked.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.495
How much do you remember?

14:59.198 --> 15:02.000
(panting)

15:02.002 --> 15:03.635
I don't know.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.170
I... I...

15:06.172 --> 15:08.940
I remember her just lying there,

15:08.942 --> 15:12.210
Just lying there.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.947
And all the...
Blood around her...

15:19.518 --> 15:22.553
We were high school sweethearts.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.960
Did you see the person
who hurt you and your wife?

15:31.397 --> 15:33.031
Do you remember his face?

15:33.599 --> 15:37.135
(woman's faint, distorted cries)

15:37.137 --> 15:39.203
I can see him...

15:39.205 --> 15:42.140
Standing over her,

15:42.142 --> 15:43.708
Hitting her over...

15:43.710 --> 15:46.344
And over...

15:46.346 --> 15:48.980
And...

15:48.982 --> 15:50.248
And I'm powerless.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.484
I... I can't stop him.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.687
Like there's a wall
between us. I...

15:55.689 --> 15:59.557
Yet I can still hear the
sickening sound of...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.326
Blow...

16:01.328 --> 16:03.161
After blow.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.196
Mr. Garnez...

16:05.198 --> 16:07.732
We want to... We want
to show you some photographs

16:07.734 --> 16:09.701
Of some faces.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.437
We need you to tell us
if any one of these men

16:12.439 --> 16:15.673
Looks like the man that
we've been talking about, okay?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.013
He's not there.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.548
Are you sure?

16:25.351 --> 16:26.985
None of these...

16:26.987 --> 16:30.321
Is the man that
killed my tina.

16:32.358 --> 16:35.660
Hodges, you texted me "911"?

16:35.662 --> 16:36.995
I did.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.997
What is the 911?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.099
Sorry. Your suspect.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.301
He ran from the motel
room barefoot, correct?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.435
Mm-hmm.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
Yet he left no shoes behind.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.271
He could have been
carrying his shoes.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.008
He was in too much
of a hurry to put them on.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.343
Mm, maybe. But there
was a bottle of shampoo

16:52.345 --> 16:53.745
That nick found
in the bathroom.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.114
It contained
one percent permethrin,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.282
Formulated to
combat head lice.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.751
Now, I've checked with doc.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.387
Neither of the smiths
were head lice sufferers.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.122
So the shampoo
was for the guest.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.424
Yes. Presumably the killer.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.259
Nick found residue on
the wall of the shower.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.562
I've tested it; it contained
<i>five</i> percent permethrin.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.564
Permethrin, for the head lice.
No.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.767
This is five percent,
in a body cream.

17:15.769 --> 17:19.137
It's prescription strength,
used to treat scabies.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.739
I don't want to seem
insensitive, but...

17:21.741 --> 17:23.374
Shoeless, head lice,

17:23.376 --> 17:26.377
And scabies-- that all
sounds like homeless to me.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.746
Richard smith worked
with the homeless

17:28.748 --> 17:33.317
He could have been doing
some sort of outreach,
wanted to help somebody,

17:33.319 --> 17:35.086
Brought them in
off the street.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.122
There's a local shelter
called street saviors

17:38.124 --> 17:39.791
Who had a scabies
outbreak last week,

17:39.793 --> 17:43.061
Where they distributed this
very same prescription cream.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.596
Way to bury the lead, hodges.
That's part
of my charm.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.131
It's all in the telling.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.433
Finlay:
The regular.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.401
Yeah. Fruity.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.470
Okay, thanks so much.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.376
Hey. So I talked
to a couple
hey.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.811
Of the outreach
workers.

17:59.813 --> 18:03.147
They saw a guy earlier,
a guy named rudy.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.649
He's a regular here.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.385
He was barefoot,
had bloodstained clothes.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.820
Sounds like our boy.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.254
Finlay:
Yeah. According to the locals,

18:10.256 --> 18:12.190
He likes to hang out here,
under the bridge.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.164
Anybody seen rudy?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.432
Huh?

18:22.334 --> 18:24.602
Stokes:
You seen rudy?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.471
You know who rudy is?

18:28.173 --> 18:30.141
Hey, where
does rudy stay?

18:34.680 --> 18:37.181
Hey, old-timer.
Hey, man.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.450
You seen rudy anywhere?

18:54.266 --> 18:56.801
Rudy!
(gasping)

18:56.803 --> 18:58.536
What's wrong?

18:59.338 --> 19:01.672
What have you
been doing, man?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.642
(panting)
huh?

19:06.211 --> 19:09.847
Rudy, you're gonna have
to come with us.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.150
Rudy, it says here
in my files

19:12.152 --> 19:14.352
That you spent some time
in the state hospital.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.686
Had a few psych holds?

19:15.688 --> 19:18.856
Yeah, I have some problems.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.691
What did the doctors
diagnose you with?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.829
Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.931
Generalized anxiety,

19:26.933 --> 19:28.866
Paranoia...
Brass:
Well, that's okay.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.935
We get the idea.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.704
Do you recognize these two?
Richard and ann?

19:33.706 --> 19:35.706
They're angels.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.843
What do you mean?
They rescued me.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.345
How?
I was on the
street, out front

19:41.347 --> 19:43.881
Of a drugstore on cramer.
Oh, that's

19:43.883 --> 19:46.484
Right near
the sky view motel.
I go there sometimes

19:46.486 --> 19:49.754
To ask for change,
you know, and-and I...

19:49.756 --> 19:51.222
These guys,

19:51.224 --> 19:52.857
They jumped me and-and...

19:52.859 --> 19:54.825
And they beat me,

19:54.827 --> 19:58.229
And they took my change
and they took my shoes.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.931
And-and it probably
would have been worse,

19:59.933 --> 20:01.666
Except that richard and ann
came along

20:01.668 --> 20:02.934
Out of nowhere and...

20:02.936 --> 20:05.870
And chased them away.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.205
Rudy, what happened next?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.710
I told you, they're angels.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.845
They-they-they...

20:14.847 --> 20:16.414
They asked me if
I wanted to stay

20:16.416 --> 20:18.883
In their room with them,
and they got me a toothbrush

20:18.885 --> 20:21.552
And stuff, and they let me
get a shower

20:21.554 --> 20:23.387
And get all cleaned up.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.989
Did something happen
after the shower?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.559
Something happened, didn't it?

20:30.729 --> 20:31.929
(mutters): I don't know.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.598
I don't remember.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.700
Come on, rudy, think.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.536
Think real hard.
(shuddering breath)

20:38.538 --> 20:39.637
(distorted shout):
No! No!

20:45.444 --> 20:46.911
There were these dolls...

20:46.913 --> 20:48.946
<i>A-and there were</i>
<i>a whole bunch of them,</i>

20:48.948 --> 20:52.316
<i>And they started talking to me</i>
<i>and they were looking at me.</i>

20:52.318 --> 20:53.584
(distorted screaming,
eerie voices speaking)

20:55.420 --> 20:57.755
What were they saying, rudy?
What did they say?

20:57.757 --> 21:01.826
Did the dolls
tell you to do this?

21:01.828 --> 21:03.694
(gasps, screams)

21:03.696 --> 21:04.929
I...

21:07.532 --> 21:10.468
I did that, didn't I?
I did that with the scissors.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.036
I hurt them.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.738
(shrieking)

21:13.740 --> 21:14.839
(eerie, distorted,
high-pitched laughter)

21:14.841 --> 21:15.740
(shriek echoing)

21:15.742 --> 21:17.875
What about these people?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.777
(rudy gasping repeatedly)

21:21.546 --> 21:22.947
Did you hurt them, too?

21:25.450 --> 21:28.319
I don't know.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.688
Finlay: <i>You know, sometimes</i>
<i>I think we forget</i>

21:30.690 --> 21:33.024
What delicate,
complex machines we are.

21:33.026 --> 21:36.894
You know, all it takes are a few
short-circuiting synapses,

21:36.896 --> 21:39.497
Or a breakdown
in myelination,

21:39.499 --> 21:40.998
And everything gets thrown
out of whack.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.901
Jules, you just
captured a killer.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.937
I know.
Then why do I feel so bad?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.439
Because he seems like
a nice guy

21:48.441 --> 21:50.541
Who got dealt a lousy hand
in life.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.346
So we have him for killing
the smiths, right?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.981
What about the other
two attacks?

21:56.983 --> 22:00.051
Well, I could go over all the
evidence and make a case.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.019
He's obviously
our prime suspect.

22:02.021 --> 22:06.991
He frequented the area,
and he's obviously unstable.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.028
Good work.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.364
You put some long hours
in on this.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.498
Why-why don't you go home,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.634
Get yourself some rest.

22:29.981 --> 22:33.484
(tv playing indistinctly
in distance)

22:33.486 --> 22:35.953
(yelling, panting)

22:35.955 --> 22:38.055
Take it, take it easy!

22:38.057 --> 22:40.091
One plus one is two.
One for me and one for you.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.094
Two plus two is four. (panting)

22:43.096 --> 22:45.629
<i>That's a couple more.</i>
<i>Three plus three is six.</i>

22:45.631 --> 22:46.997
<i>Straight and crooked sticks!</i>

22:46.999 --> 22:47.865
Get away!

22:47.867 --> 22:51.402
(siren wailing)

22:51.404 --> 22:53.137
(muttering)

22:53.139 --> 22:54.138
One plus one is two.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.707
Two plus two is four,
and that's a couple more.

22:56.709 --> 23:00.044
One plus one is two.
One for me and one for you.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.412
Two plus two is four.
That's a couple more.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.980
Three plus
three is six.
Ma'am.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.382
Straight and crooked sticks.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.716
You need to drop
that bottle, do you hear me?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.419
Four plus four is eight.
Seagulls on the gate!

23:08.421 --> 23:10.121
Five plus five is ten.
Hey!

23:10.123 --> 23:11.589
Do you hear
what I'm saying?!

23:11.591 --> 23:14.759
Drop the bottle!

23:14.761 --> 23:16.427
Ricky doesn't follow directions!

23:16.429 --> 23:19.630
He never follows directions!

23:20.565 --> 23:21.599
(yells)

23:21.601 --> 23:23.701
(tazer clicking)

23:25.604 --> 23:26.804
Thanks, man.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.173
Seriously, thanks.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.908
Thanks.
All right.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.109
(gasps)

23:32.111 --> 23:33.511
Hey!

23:33.513 --> 23:34.945
Was she staying here?
In the motel?

23:34.947 --> 23:37.181
Uh, yeah, just
since tonight.

23:37.816 --> 23:38.949
What room?

23:46.057 --> 23:48.592
(door creaking)

23:50.796 --> 23:52.897
It's happened again.

24:01.873 --> 24:04.008
(indistinct radio communication,
siren whoops in distance)

24:23.094 --> 24:25.196
How the hell can this be?

24:25.198 --> 24:26.730
I thought we had our killer.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.899
Did we mess up, jules?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.634
Did we make a mistake
with our-our homeless guy?

24:30.636 --> 24:33.504
No, rudy's guilty,
maybe not of all three,

24:33.506 --> 24:35.473
But he definitely
killed the smiths.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.240
Then how do we explain this?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.641
I don't know.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.710
It has to be... Unrelated.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.178
Unrelated?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.880
Four murders in the same room

24:42.882 --> 24:44.548
Over a three-month period.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.484
That's got to be connected,
don't you think?

24:46.486 --> 24:47.651
(garbled radio transmission)

24:49.221 --> 24:52.490
All right, I'm sorry. Look,

24:52.492 --> 24:53.791
All right, who are
our players tonight?

24:53.793 --> 24:55.593
Who are we talking about here?

24:55.595 --> 24:57.962
Suspect is a woman,

24:57.964 --> 25:00.231
28-year-old
high school math teacher.

25:00.233 --> 25:03.534
Victim was one of her students.

25:03.536 --> 25:06.537
Together in a sleazy,
$39-a-night motel room.

25:06.539 --> 25:11.509
With lingerie, condoms,
sex toys and alcohol.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.244
Wonder what
was going on here, right?

25:13.246 --> 25:17.281
To the school web site, she was
just named teacher of the year.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.716
I'll bet she was.

25:18.718 --> 25:19.950
Hey.
Hey.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.185
So, this may

25:21.187 --> 25:23.053
Sound crazy,
but I'm thinking

25:23.055 --> 25:25.022
That this isn't
what it looks like.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.557
I don't believe
that the teacher

25:26.559 --> 25:27.725
Was sleeping with her student.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.593
Yeah, you're right,
that sounds crazy.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.262
Well, listen to this voice mail

25:31.264 --> 25:32.763
I found on her phone.

25:32.765 --> 25:33.731
Young man:
Ms. Stone, it's matthew.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.099
I don't know what to do,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.835
But my parents have been
drinking and fighting,

25:37.837 --> 25:40.204
And I can't go home;

25:40.206 --> 25:43.073
I'm at a motel.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.275
But I'm scared.

25:44.277 --> 25:46.143
I don't know who else to call.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.779
I'm sorry, but you have
to help me, please.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.782
Brass: Ms. Stone, we are
trying to make sense

25:51.784 --> 25:55.219
Out of what happened
in that room.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.087
But we need your help
to do that.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.257
Stokes:
Boy, matthew must
have told you

26:00.259 --> 26:04.595
A really sad story
to lure you to that motel room.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.764
Now, obviously,

26:06.766 --> 26:09.266
From the items he brought along,
he had ideas of getting

26:09.268 --> 26:11.235
Romantic with you.
Brass:
Now, there were a lot of empty

26:11.237 --> 26:12.903
Liquor bottles in the room.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.204
Was the young man drunk?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.740
There wasn't any drinking.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.578
First thing I did was dump
all the alcohol down the sink.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.779
I wanted it
clear to matthew

26:21.781 --> 26:23.781
That nothing was going
to happen.

26:23.783 --> 26:24.982
Did he get upset?

26:24.984 --> 26:25.983
Is that when he threatened you?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.985
He would never.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.722
Matthew's a...
Matthew's a great kid.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.124
He just had a harmless crush,
that's all.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.126
He would never hurt me.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.595
Then why did you kill him?

26:42.067 --> 26:45.636
It wasn't me.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.037
Really? Wasn't you?

26:47.039 --> 26:48.038
Ms. Stone,

26:48.040 --> 26:49.239
Look, look at this.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.043
(whimpering, grunts)

26:53.045 --> 26:55.346
That's not me.

26:55.348 --> 26:58.649
I mean, it's me, it's my body,
but I...

27:00.919 --> 27:02.219
I had no control.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.355
It was like there was
something inside me.

27:04.357 --> 27:05.856
I was...

27:07.926 --> 27:09.927
...Possessed.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.295
Brass:
You were what?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.831
(crying):
I was...

27:15.800 --> 27:18.002
I don't know. Part of me
really wants to believe her.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.037
I mean, the woman ranting
and screaming on that video

27:20.039 --> 27:22.873
From last night was nothing
like the woman I met today.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.676
They were two totally
different people.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.112
So, her behavior last night
was completely out of character.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.280
Mm-hmm!
Did the hospital do
a tox screen?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.683
Yeah, it was clean.
Not even alcohol.

27:32.685 --> 27:35.986
Then it's got to be the room.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.188
The room made her do it.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.824
What, like, <i>the shining?</i> Hmm?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.026
The overlook hotel?

27:42.028 --> 27:43.661
It's the one thing

27:43.663 --> 27:46.397
Connecting all of the murders.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.098
Right now, it's the only thing.

27:48.100 --> 27:52.436
Okay, so, let's have hodges
and henry drag their equipment

27:52.438 --> 27:54.872
Out there and test the room,
see what they have to say.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.912
Hmm.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.082
(electronic crackling)

28:05.084 --> 28:07.985
I've got some elevated vocs
in the air conditioner,

28:07.987 --> 28:11.088
But nothing that would explain
any of the bizarre behavior.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.724
What about you?

28:13.726 --> 28:15.359
You got anything yet?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.728
Could I have five minutes
to look first?

28:21.399 --> 28:24.234
Oh, and I'm very much enjoying
the dirty bathroom.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.769
Thank you for that.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.709
(sighs)

28:31.711 --> 28:33.811
Mm! Mm...

28:33.813 --> 28:35.846
Great. Now I can smell
like a fruit bowl

28:35.848 --> 28:37.314
For the rest of the day.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.489
(electronic crackling)

28:58.436 --> 29:01.338
(electronic crackling)

29:14.919 --> 29:16.386
(electronic crackling)

29:16.388 --> 29:17.454
It looks like
they've got mold

29:17.456 --> 29:20.424
Inside the walls of the closet.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.159
I'm going to have
to get a sample.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.361
Do you have the pry bar
in there?

29:24.363 --> 29:26.497
Hey, I have
to open some drywall.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.832
Do you have the pry bar
in your kit?

29:28.834 --> 29:30.467
Hodges!

29:32.270 --> 29:34.071
Seriously?

29:34.073 --> 29:36.340
(sighs)

29:36.342 --> 29:38.342
Hodges, what
are you doing?

29:38.344 --> 29:39.376
I was calling you.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.978
(grunting, huffing)

29:46.017 --> 29:47.417
What are you
looking at?

29:49.287 --> 29:50.154
(grunting, growling)

29:52.357 --> 29:54.958
What, what's
going on with you?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.261
I know who you are.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.363
Okay, look, w-why don't you
have a seat on the toilet...

29:59.365 --> 30:01.832
(continues indistinctly)

30:01.834 --> 30:03.534
I'm gonna help you
out, come here.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.837
I can see what you are!

30:06.839 --> 30:08.572
(yelling)

30:08.574 --> 30:11.375
Hodges, let go of me!
That hurts!

30:11.377 --> 30:13.911
(hodges grunts, pants)

30:16.581 --> 30:18.816
No... Hodges!

30:18.818 --> 30:19.950
No, no...!

30:22.854 --> 30:23.821
(hodges pounding on door)

30:23.823 --> 30:25.122
This is henry andrews.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.825
I'm at the sky view motel,
room 114,

30:27.827 --> 30:29.593
And I have an emergency.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.295
I need police and ems
immediately.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.563
(hodges yelling, bellowing)

30:37.068 --> 30:38.936
Excuse me...
Hey! Henry!

30:40.572 --> 30:41.371
Henry?

30:41.373 --> 30:42.539
Hey, man, you all right?

30:42.541 --> 30:43.507
What's going on out here?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.242
I don't know exactly.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.211
He just flipped out.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.580
Nick, I honestly think
he would have killed me.

30:49.582 --> 30:51.515
Hodges?
Yeah, but it
wasn't hodges.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.250
I mean, if you would've
seen the look in his eyes,

30:53.252 --> 30:54.885
Something must have
happened to him in there,

30:54.887 --> 30:57.221
Something to trigger this.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.856
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.390
Everything that came out
of him was unintelligible.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.393
And growls.
Hey, so paramedics
hit him

31:03.395 --> 31:04.561
With a sedative.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.296
Once they get him to
the hospital,

31:06.298 --> 31:07.931
Maybe we'll figure out
what's going on.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.933
Wait, wait, before he goes,

31:09.935 --> 31:10.601
I-I need a-a... A swab.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.102
Check your vest.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.203
Andrews:
Hold up.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.272
Hey, buddy,

31:15.274 --> 31:17.941
Can you help me out?
(mumbling)

31:17.943 --> 31:19.109
Can you open up?

31:19.111 --> 31:20.310
Come on,
just open up.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.980
There you go,
help me out.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.181
There you go.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.349
Good.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.384
Yeah, get him out of here.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.057
Doctor:
Vitals are good...

31:34.059 --> 31:36.059
(doctor continues
indistinctly)

31:36.061 --> 31:37.227
Russell: Thanks, doc.
I appreciate it.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.462
You're welcome.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.264
What did he say?
How's he doing?

31:40.266 --> 31:41.632
He's gonna be okay.

31:41.634 --> 31:44.101
I mean, his vitals are all
in the normal range.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.403
He doesn't seem to be
in any physical distress.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.538
Well, obviously there is
something going on

31:48.540 --> 31:52.009
Now we need to add hodges
to the list

31:52.011 --> 31:53.644
Of people that went
nuts in there, right?

31:53.646 --> 31:55.178
Homeless guy, the teacher--

31:55.180 --> 31:58.081
Makes me wonder about our
first victim, mark bell.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.017
Who's to say he didn't
go crazy, too,

32:00.019 --> 32:02.019
And stab himself in his legs.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.354
If all of this is true,

32:04.356 --> 32:07.257
What's it say about the man
who lost his wife?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.326
Andrews:
Hey, guys,

32:09.328 --> 32:10.661
You are not gonna
believe this one.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.095
Hodges was drugged.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.297
What are you talking about?

32:13.299 --> 32:16.366
Lsd-- I did an elisa test
on his saliva.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.302
Somehow, he must've been dosed

32:18.304 --> 32:21.638
Wait a minute, didn't the
hospital do a tox screen

32:21.640 --> 32:24.241
On the teacher and on rudy,
and it came back negative?

32:24.243 --> 32:26.476
The standard tox panel
doesn't test for lsd,

32:26.478 --> 32:27.978
So they were probably
dosed, too--

32:27.980 --> 32:29.413
We just had no way
to know it.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.048
But wh-why the violence?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.417
The molecules I found
were highly adulterated,

32:33.419 --> 32:36.253
And cut with a cyclidine
similar to pcp.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.288
Probably came out of
somebody's kitchen sink.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.290
Okay.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.425
Now we know what.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.695
Let's go find out how.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.498
Stokes (muffled):
So, according to henry,

32:48.500 --> 32:51.501
This lysergic acid glows blue.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.170
And the stuff's potent.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.438
We may not be looking
for much.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.572
Sanders (muffled):
Wait a minute--

32:55.574 --> 32:56.640
Got something over here.

32:58.443 --> 33:00.711
These are tiny drops.

33:00.713 --> 33:04.181
It looks like they might've
been aerosolized.

33:08.419 --> 33:12.122
Stokes: Check it out--
covered in blue.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.623
This is our source
right here.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.692
Sanders: If hodges
got sprayed by that,

33:15.694 --> 33:18.228
It would only have to land
on his lips

33:18.230 --> 33:20.664
Or in his eye, and it would
be instantly absorbed.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.440
Here, let me bag it.

33:33.212 --> 33:38.315
I don't think the lsd was
coming from that cartridge.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.485
There's a hose in here.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.456
Yeah, and it's coming
through the wall

33:46.458 --> 33:47.791
From the next room.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.264
(pounding on door)

33:54.266 --> 33:56.733
Stokes: Hey, oscar, can we use
your bathroom for a second?

33:56.735 --> 33:58.468
Hey! You can't come
in here like this!

33:58.470 --> 34:00.437
Sure we can.
Check it out, greg.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.373
It's called
probable cause, oscar.

34:04.675 --> 34:05.575
What do you got?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.449
Found the source.

34:14.352 --> 34:16.686
Oscar, I remember
standing right there

34:16.688 --> 34:18.755
And listening to you
preach to me about god's will.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.656
Is this what you meant? Huh?

34:19.658 --> 34:21.224
Killing six people?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.393
I didn't kill anyone.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.429
You've been spraying lsd
all over the bathroom next door.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.464
You're responsible!

34:27.466 --> 34:28.598
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.733
God sees the truth.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.268
Yes, sir!
God knows my heart!

34:31.270 --> 34:32.402
Stokes: You know what?
I'm tired of hearing that.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.405
Sit down, relax.
I'm gonna get you a ride.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.307
Sanders: Nick,
take a look at this.

34:42.113 --> 34:44.081
That's an odd place for a tv.

34:48.119 --> 34:51.488
That's the room next door--
room 114.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.324
So not only have you been dosing
the people next door,

34:54.326 --> 34:58.495
Hey, nick, I don't see
any recording device.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.798
But there's this transmitter

35:01.800 --> 35:03.767
Set up to send a signal
someplace else.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.336
So what's with all
the video stuff?
I don't know.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.704
I just know I'm not
supposed to touch it.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.872
Yeah? Who told you that?

35:08.874 --> 35:11.408
Huh?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.878
Trent, the manager.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.581
He said if I did,
he'd kick me out.

35:21.152 --> 35:24.254
Trent raeger, got a warrant.
See you downtown.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.394
(door shuts)

35:40.438 --> 35:41.438
Hey, nick,

35:41.440 --> 35:43.640
You gotta come
and see this.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.309
Our peeper has been looking
at all the rooms,

35:46.311 --> 35:48.211
Not just room 114.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.855
Yeah, he's been spending
some quality time in here.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.335
Hmm. These are all souvenirs...

36:13.604 --> 36:15.772
...From his favorite guests.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.413
Brass: You've been peeping
on room 114 for a long time,

36:23.415 --> 36:25.582
Haven't you, trent?

36:25.584 --> 36:28.385
At what point did you decide
that it wasn't enough

36:28.387 --> 36:32.389
I mean, when did you decide
that you needed to kill people?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.824
It isn't like that.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.360
Okay, then tell me
what it's like.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.929
Well, it's just about...

36:41.599 --> 36:43.533
...Watching, you know?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.770
All the people coming
through the motel.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.472
When I was a kid, we'd get
a family on vacation,

36:49.474 --> 36:52.809
And I was curious because
we never took vacations.

36:52.811 --> 36:56.279
We never left.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.348
So...

36:58.350 --> 36:59.583
I had these special places

36:59.585 --> 37:01.318
Where I could look
through the walls...

37:01.320 --> 37:02.886
Watch them.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.355
(whispers):
Special places.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.724
Then the video age came

37:07.726 --> 37:09.759
And you upgraded
your little hobby, right?

37:11.529 --> 37:13.496
That was pretty cool, too.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.332
I mean, especially when
the motel kind of

37:15.334 --> 37:16.666
Went downhill, you know?

37:16.668 --> 37:19.569
That brought all kinds
of crazy stuff.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.905
The crack whores, drunk dudes,

37:21.907 --> 37:23.940
Beating their wives, they...

37:23.942 --> 37:27.677
That is a show, believe me.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.579
But even that
got a little old and dull,

37:29.581 --> 37:32.716
So you spiced it up by
dosing people with drugs?

37:32.718 --> 37:38.655
A few months ago, I saw this guy
out on third, tripping on acid.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.625
He was, like, out of his mind,

37:41.627 --> 37:45.295
And it was just so...

37:45.297 --> 37:47.364
So weird.

37:48.666 --> 37:51.968
And that is when I came up with
that rig for the bathroom.

37:53.704 --> 37:57.440
You have to admit...
It is pretty clever.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.509
Clever.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.922
Five people are dead,
one is in the hospital.

38:12.924 --> 38:17.027
Hey, I just put the gas
in the car... Okay?

38:17.029 --> 38:19.062
They're the ones
that crashed it.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.501
Come on...

38:24.503 --> 38:26.970
You've got my tapes;
you've seen 'em.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.907
That first dude,
hacking his legs off.

38:30.909 --> 38:34.511
Or that teacher...
Oh, and the homeless guy.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.880
I mean, the dude is
already a total mess,

38:36.882 --> 38:38.948
And then the lady has
all those dolls!

38:38.950 --> 38:41.785
I mean, that was a gift.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.421
Or the poor mexican guy...

38:44.423 --> 38:46.823
Killing his wife.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.360
Honestly, I didn't
see that coming.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.561
I mean, that...

38:51.563 --> 38:52.762
That...

38:54.532 --> 38:56.800
...That was awesome.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.537
(quietly):
Awesome.

39:01.906 --> 39:04.407
What are you looking
at me like that for?

39:04.409 --> 39:07.544
Come on, people go online
every day to look at stuff

39:07.546 --> 39:08.878
That's just like that.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.647
But you manipulated this.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.817
You made this happen.

39:13.819 --> 39:16.786
You made these people,
these innocent people,

39:16.788 --> 39:18.588
Do these things.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.825
So what?

39:23.394 --> 39:25.862
What's the difference?

39:28.366 --> 39:31.000
Well, you'll have 25 years
to life to figure that out.

39:31.002 --> 39:34.871
And the weird thing is you're
gonna be in a little room

39:34.873 --> 39:37.741
With people watching you 24/7.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.115
Hey.

39:47.852 --> 39:50.053
I, uh, heard they're going
to be discharging you soon.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.888
Yeah.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.724
I guess I've healed as much
as I'm going to.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.160
Well, I... I came 'cause
I wanted you to know

39:57.162 --> 39:58.795
That we arrested
the man responsible

39:58.797 --> 40:00.964
For what happened to you
and to your wife.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.899
He didn't physically
do the killings,

40:02.901 --> 40:04.601
But he is responsible.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.804
Well, I-I... I'm sorry,
I'm a little confused here.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.739
The man we arrested...

40:09.741 --> 40:11.408
Lived in the motel,

40:11.410 --> 40:14.444
And he drugged
several of his guests.

40:15.746 --> 40:20.016
That night, when your wife
went to sleep,

40:20.018 --> 40:23.720
You went into the bathroom
and you snuck a cigarette.

40:23.722 --> 40:29.092
You were dosed with
a very potent psychedelic drug,

40:29.094 --> 40:33.463
And it caused a violent
change in your personality

40:33.465 --> 40:34.931
And your behavior.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.067
That face... That you saw...

40:38.069 --> 40:40.904
The man who was hitting
your wife...

40:55.786 --> 40:58.087
Uh... In a little while,

40:58.089 --> 41:00.757
There's going to be some
police officers coming here,

41:00.759 --> 41:04.594
And you're going to need
to go with them, okay?

41:04.596 --> 41:07.163
I'm sorry.

41:27.918 --> 41:31.688
I want to apologize
for anything I may have said

41:31.690 --> 41:36.960
It wasn't your words so much
as your actions, really.

41:43.767 --> 41:46.703
And, obviously...

41:46.705 --> 41:48.838
I apologize for those, too.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.978
Apology accepted?

42:00.284 --> 42:01.918
Yes.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.554
(sighs with relief)

42:04.556 --> 42:05.955
Apology accepted.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.023
Good.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.291
Then you won't be trying to

42:08.293 --> 42:09.959
Get back at me in some way?

42:09.961 --> 42:12.562
No, of course not.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.900
But I wouldn't drink
that coffee, if I were you.
