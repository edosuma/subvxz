>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
I SEE THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN

13:17.160 --> 13:20.730

GEORGIA WHO HASN'T YET VOTED TO
PARTICIPATE IN THIS ELECTION AND

13:24.301 --> 13:25.735

SAME THING.
WHAT IS TRUMP DOING TO THE

13:38.984 --> 13:40.085
REPUBLICAN PARTY?

13:40.185 --> 13:45.691
>> YOU WOULD NOT KNOW FROM THE
PANDERING AND ANTICS OF

13:45.792 --> 13:46.893
GEORGIA'S TWO SENATORS THAT
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT

13:46.993 --> 13:51.397
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TONIGHT.
WHAT WE NEED IS IS A STRONG

13:51.497 --> 13:55.101
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE AND TO
RUSH ECONOMIC RELIEF TO THE

13:55.201 --> 13:58.739

THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

13:58.839 --> 14:00.740
THAT EVERYBODY HERE IN GEORGIA
GETS OUT TO THE POLLS TODAY SO

14:00.840 --> 14:11.418

SHE RAN FOR GOVERNOR IN 2018.

14:53.865 --> 14:56.000
SHE CAME CLOSE.
SHE DID NOT WIN BUT SHE STAYED

14:56.100 --> 15:00.705
IN THE FIGHT.
SHE REGISTERED MORE THAN 500,000

15:00.806 --> 15:04.176
NEW VOTERS IN GEORGIA.
THESE EFFORTS COMBINED,

15:04.277 --> 15:09.114
OBVIOUSLY, WITH THOUSANDS OF
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT US TO

UNITED STATES SENATE BLUE.

15:13.686 --> 15:16.123

I KNOW THAT A LOT OF WORK HAS
GONE TO YOU.

15:25.999 --> 15:28.836
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS STATE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

15:28.936 --> 15:32.606
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN
BUILT HERE AND A HISTORIC NUMBER

15:32.708 --> 15:35.744
OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT TO VOTE IS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SEEMS

15:35.844 --> 15:37.345
SUSTAINED.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TONIGHT?

15:37.445 --> 15:39.248
>> REMARKABLE.
WE KNOW THAT MORE AND MORE

REMOVE BARRIERS TO INCREASE
ACCESS AND TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST

15:48.123 --> 15:50.060
THOSE WHO WOULD DENY THEM
AGENCY.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.931
MY WORK IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO
THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO ENSURE OUR

15:55.032 --> 15:56.966
DEMOCRACY IS VIBRANT.
THAT MEANS VIBRANT FOR EVERYONE.

15:57.066 --> 15:59.802
IT WOULD FEEL GREAT IF OUR
CANDIDATES WIN BECAUSE THAT

15:59.902 --> 16:02.340
MEANS WE GET THE POLICIES WE

NOW THEY THINK THEY MAY CALL IT
TONIGHT.

16:44.818 --> 16:47.355

OVERPERFORMING.

STRUGGLING PARTLY BECAUSE THE

MAKE LIKE LET'S BE A CHECK ON

TRYING IN WASHINGTON.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS TO

18:23.325 --> 18:26.662
TRUMP'S POWER IN WASHINGTON?
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE

18:26.762 --> 18:28.632
ASKED HIS PARTY TO WALK THE
PLANK.

18:28.731 --> 18:34.305
RIGHT.
TO GIVE UP THEIR SORT OF ETHICAL

18:34.404 --> 18:36.140
COMPASS WHEN IT COMES TO
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.

18:36.239 --> 18:41.912
THEY HAVE TO WALK IT AND JUMP IN

WE'RE WATCHING CAPITOL HILL FOR
A SHOW FROM REPUBLICANS IN THE

MORE THAN 100 OF THEM HAVE

PRESSURE ON OTHER REPUBLICANS,
EVEN THE VICE PRESIDENT TO JOIN

THE FACT YOU ARE ALL HERE ON

SHOULD BE A MESSAGE TO ALL THE

REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN
WILLING TO ACTUALLY FIGHT.

19:48.018 --> 19:52.990
THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING TO
STOP THIS STEAL.

19:53.091 --> 19:57.295
THIS ISN'T THEIR REPUBLICAN
PARTY ANYMORE!

19:57.394 --> 20:03.835
THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

20:03.935 --> 20:13.479
>> YOU CAN BE A HERO OR YOU CAN
BE A ZERO.

20:13.578 --> 20:17.049
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE
ZERO AND NOT THE HERO, WE'RE

20:17.150 --> 20:27.928

I HOPE SO.

IF YOU DON'T FIGHT LIKE HELL,
YOU WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY

WE'RE GOING TO THE CAPITOL AND
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND GIVE A

REPUBLICANS THE WEAK ONES,
BECAUSE THE STRONG ONES DON'T

>> WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW A
PROTESTER ACTUALLY IN THE OFFICE

27:04.758 --> 27:12.433
OF HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI.

27:12.534 --> 27:16.171
>> PROTESTERS HAVE GONE INTO ALL
CORNERS OF THE BUILDING.

27:16.270 --> 27:23.412
POLICE ARE OVERRUN.
THEY ASKED FOR REINFORCEMENTS

27:23.512 --> 27:28.418
TO WITH THIS SITUATION.

27:28.518 --> 27:31.254
>> JUST HOW OUT OF CONTROL IT
HAS GOTTEN.

27:31.354 --> 27:35.593
A WOMAN IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION
AFTER BEING SHOT.

27:35.692 --> 27:38.595
>> I'M TOLD THE LEADERSHIP AS
WELL AS THE SENATE PRO TEM ARE

27:38.696 --> 27:40.463
IN A SAFE PLACE.

27:40.564 --> 27:45.269
>> THERE IS IS A FEELING RIGHT
NOW THAT FINALLY THERE IS A LAW

27:45.370 --> 27:54.645
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE AND THEY
ARE ABOUT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE

27:54.746 --> 27:57.115
SITUATION.
THE CAPITOL POLICE HAVE SPOKEN

27:57.216 --> 28:11.265
AND THEY HAVE CLEARLY GOT --
SOME AREAS OF THE BUILDING --

28:15.768 --> 28:21.543
>> IT HAS BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH
RIOTERS AND PROTESTERS AND

28:21.643 --> 28:22.343
DEMONSTRATORS IN THE SENATE
FLOOR.

28:22.442 --> 28:23.644
THERE'S DEBRIS ON THE SENATE
FLOOR.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.512
THERE WAS AN ARMED STANDOFF THAT
OCCURRED.

28:25.613 --> 28:29.116
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LATEST IS
ON THAT SITUATION.

28:29.217 --> 28:32.555
>> OF COURSE THIS IS HOW THE
TRUMP ERA ENDS.

28:32.654 --> 28:35.723
>> THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A PEACEFUL

28:35.824 --> 28:39.027
TRANSFER OF POWER.
LINCOLN TALKED ABOUT SOME PEOPLE

28:39.127 --> 28:43.333
WANT RULE OR RUIN.
IF I CAN'T HAVE IT MY WAY, I'LL

28:43.432 --> 28:46.169
BURN THE WHOLE COUNTRY DOWN.

28:46.268 --> 28:49.940
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS
REFUSING TO AUTHORIZE THE

28:50.039 --> 29:00.017
DEPLOYMENT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

29:00.116 --> 29:00.718
EXPLAINED.

29:01.251 --> 29:04.690
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE

29:04.789 --> 29:05.891
WATCHING THIS ON TELEVISION AND
SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME

29:05.990 --> 29:10.796
TWEETING ABOUT HIS --

29:10.895 --> 29:18.337
>> SAYING NOTHING.

29:18.438 --> 29:28.949
>> SIGNALING HE'S ON THEIR SIDE.

29:32.853 --> 29:43.832
>> THIS IS A SAD, PATHETIC
AFTERMATH OF THIS UTTER FUCK

29:43.931 --> 29:44.332
SHOW.

29:44.431 --> 29:54.410
>> 12 MORE YEARS.

29:59.981 --> 30:10.160
[ GUNSHOT ]

30:11.827 --> 30:15.299
>> IT'S A PRETTY DECENT SIZE
INFLUX OF RIOT POLICE HAVE MOVED

30:15.400 --> 30:18.835
IN FROM THE WEST.

30:18.935 --> 30:23.740
>> THIS, OF COURSE, IS THE PLACE
RIGHT OVER HERE WHERE JOE BIDEN

30:23.841 --> 30:26.045
AND EVERY OTHER PREVIOUS
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INAUGURATED

30:26.144 --> 30:33.719
FROM AND THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS
OF BUILDING THE DAIS FOR BIDEN'S

30:33.818 --> 30:38.223
INAUGURATION TWO WEEKS FROM NOW.
IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT HERE ON

30:38.325 --> 30:43.363
THE SPOT.

30:43.462 --> 30:46.298
>> THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT
MATTER.

30:46.399 --> 30:51.072
AT THE BEST, THE WORDS OF A
PRESIDENT CAN INSPIRE.

30:51.171 --> 31:01.816
AT THEIR WORST, THEY CAN INCITE.
THE WORLD IS WATCHING, LIKE SO

31:01.916 --> 31:05.821
MANY OTHER AMERICANS.
I'M GENUINELY SHOCKED AND

31:05.921 --> 31:10.525
SADDENED THAT OUR NATION SO LONG
THE BEACON OF LIGHT AND HOPE FOR

31:10.624 --> 31:17.299
DEMOCRACY IS COME TO SUCH A DARK
MOMENT.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.502
>> THIS IS, OF COURSE, EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING FOR JOE BIDEN TO

31:20.603 --> 31:23.306
BE DOING.
IT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD

31:23.406 --> 31:26.477
HAVE BEEN DOING AN HOUR AGO.

31:26.576 --> 31:31.414
>> THEREFORE I CALL ON PRESIDENT
TRUMP TO GO ON NATIONAL

31:31.515 --> 31:40.024
TELEVISION NOW TO FULFILL HIS
OATH.

31:40.124 --> 31:41.825
>> I KNOW YOUR PAIN, I KNOW YOUR
HURT.

31:41.925 --> 31:45.130
YOU HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.
WE HAVE TO HAVE PEACE.

31:45.230 --> 31:48.867
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY HURT.
IT'S A TOUGH PERIOD OF TIME.

31:48.968 --> 31:52.404
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME LIKE
THIS WHERE SUCH A THING HAPPENED

31:52.505 --> 31:55.941
WHERE THEY COULD TAKE IT AWAY
FROM ALL OF US.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.778
FROM ME, FROM YOU, FROM OUR
COUNTRY.

31:58.879 --> 32:03.650
THIS WAS A FRAUDULENT ELECTION
BUT WE CAN'T PLAY INTO THE HANDS

32:03.749 --> 32:08.588
OF THESE PEOPLE.
WE LOVE YOU.

32:08.689 --> 32:12.893
YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT GO HOME

32:12.993 --> 32:17.798
AND GO HOME IN PEACE.

32:17.899 --> 32:21.002
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOW
TELLING PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL,

32:21.103 --> 32:23.838
THE CAPITOL BUILDING IS NOW
SECURE.

32:23.939 --> 32:25.239
>> LEGISLATORS CAN GO BACK AND
FINISH THEIR WORK.

32:25.339 --> 32:28.643
>> NOW WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
THAT JOINT SESSION TO RESUME.

32:28.743 --> 32:34.083
>> TODAY WAS A DARK DAY IN THE
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES

32:34.183 --> 32:35.552
CAPITOL.
THIS IS STILL THE PEOPLES'

32:35.652 --> 32:38.086
HOUSE.
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

32:38.188 --> 32:39.255
SENATOR FROM GEORGIA.

32:39.354 --> 32:42.225
>> THE EVENTS THAT HAVE
TRANSPIRED TODAY HAVE FORCED ME

32:42.325 --> 32:46.363
TO RECONSIDER.
I CANNOT NOW IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

32:46.463 --> 32:48.466
OBJECT TO THE CERTIFICATION OF
THESE ELECTORS.

32:48.566 --> 32:52.402
>> THE VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE
TOLERATED AND THOSE WHO ENGAGED

32:52.502 --> 32:55.073
IN IT WILL BE PROSECUTED.
THIS BODY WILL ACT TO ADDRESS

32:55.172 --> 32:56.708
THE CONCERNS OF ALL AMERICANS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

32:56.807 --> 33:00.879
WE NEED AN INVESTIGATION INTO
IRREGULARITIES, FRAUD.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.079
WE NEED A WAY FORWARD.

33:02.180 --> 33:06.986
>> NO CONGRESSIONAL AUDIT IS
EVER GOING TO CONVINCE THESE

33:07.085 --> 33:08.921
VOTERS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE
PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO SAY

33:09.020 --> 33:14.727
THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN.
THE BEST WAY WE CAN SHOW RESPECT

33:14.826 --> 33:27.406
FOR THE VOTERS WHO ARE UPSET IS
BY TELLING THEM THE TRUTH.

33:31.412 --> 33:32.046
[ APPLAUSE ]

33:32.747 --> 33:35.383
>> THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE STATE
OF THE VOTE SHALL BE DEEMED THE

33:35.482 --> 33:39.486
SUFFICIENT DECLARATION OF THE
PERSONS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND

33:39.587 --> 33:43.359
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

33:43.459 --> 33:46.662
>> HISTORY CONGRESS HAS
OFFICIALLY CERTIFIED JOE BIDEN'S

33:46.761 --> 33:57.207
ELECTORAL COLLEGE VICTORY.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.345
>> HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE IN

34:02.444 --> 34:04.614
YOUR LIFE ANYWHERE?
IN CONGRESS?

34:04.714 --> 34:05.482
ANYWHERE?

34:05.582 --> 34:10.221
>> NO.
IT'S SORT OF EVEN AS I'M TALKING

34:10.321 --> 34:11.589
ABOUT IT TODAY, EVEN THOUGH I
WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

34:11.689 --> 34:19.163
IT DIDN'T REALIZE HOW REAL IT
WAS.

34:19.263 --> 34:23.669
WE HAD BEGUN THE DEBATE ON THE
CHALLENGE TO ARIZONA.

34:23.768 --> 34:28.540
YOU COULD TELL THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT WAS INTENSE BUT WHEN

34:28.640 --> 34:34.047
YOU HAD THIS MANY PROTESTERS OUT
THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

34:34.147 --> 34:40.553
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU SAW
LEADERSHIP WHISKED AWAY.

34:40.654 --> 34:48.294
THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME INTO
THE CHAMBER AND TOLD US TO SIT,

34:48.395 --> 34:52.933
PULL OUT THE GAS MASKS, WE MAY
NEED TO GET ON THE FLOOR VERY

34:53.033 --> 34:57.738
QUICKLY TO PROTECT OURSELVES.
THEN YOU STARTED HEARING THE

34:57.839 --> 35:04.946
POUNDING ON THE DOOR.
YOU HEARD THE SHOUTING.

35:05.047 --> 35:08.984
YOU HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.
THEN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, MOST

35:09.084 --> 35:12.689
OF THEM WERE MILITARY, HAD BEEN
IN THE MILITARY WERE HELPING LAW

35:12.788 --> 35:14.991
ENFORCEMENT SECURE THE CHAMBER.

35:15.091 --> 35:15.625
>> YEAH.

35:16.392 --> 35:19.863
>> THEY WERE ALSO, LIKE, TELLING
US HOW TO PUT GAS MASKS ON AND

35:19.962 --> 35:22.366
TELLING US HOW NOT TO
HYPERVENTILATE.

35:22.466 --> 35:25.069
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET IN.

35:25.169 --> 35:27.839
>> NONE OF THAT.
I FIGURED WE WERE IN A SECURE

35:27.939 --> 35:29.640
PLACE.
THEY SECURED THE CHAMBER.

35:29.741 --> 35:30.475
>> RIGHT.

35:30.575 --> 35:35.446
>> THEN WE GOT EVACUATED.

35:35.546 --> 35:37.783
THEN THEY CAME AND SAID WE HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE FAST.

35:37.883 --> 35:39.618
YOU SORT OF SEE THAT PANIC THAT
GOES.

35:39.718 --> 35:43.388
THEY TOOK US OUT THE BACK WAYS.
DOWN A LOT OF STAIRS.

35:43.488 --> 35:47.560
A LOT OF TUNNELS AND TOOK US TO
AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

35:47.660 --> 35:48.995
>> DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
ALIKE?

35:49.095 --> 35:50.462
>> YEAH.
WE WERE ALL TOGETHER.

35:50.562 --> 35:54.801
MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
OBJECTING WERE THERE WITH US.

35:54.901 --> 35:56.301
THEY WEREN'T WEARING THEIR
MASKS.

35:56.402 --> 35:56.970
>> YOU'RE KIDDING?

35:57.069 --> 35:59.506
>> NO.
THAT BOTHERED ME.

35:59.607 --> 36:06.047
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD WEAR THEIR
MASK.

36:06.147 --> 36:07.480
>> MORE IN THAT ROOM FOR --

36:07.580 --> 36:11.453
>> FOUR OR FIVE HOURS.
UNTIL YOU WENT BACK TO WORK.

36:11.553 --> 36:13.254
>> IT TOOK TIME TO SECURE THE
BUILDING.

36:13.355 --> 36:14.955
GOOD PEOPLE DID THAT.
THEY HAD TO GO ROOM TO ROOM.

36:15.056 --> 36:17.993
THESE PROTESTERS WERE HIDING AND
DESTROYING AND PLANTING THINGS

36:18.093 --> 36:21.663
AND THEY NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE
WERE REALLY GOING TO BE SAFE

36:21.763 --> 36:22.464
GOING BACK.

36:22.732 --> 36:25.334
>> RIGHT.
AND AT ANY GIVEN POINT WERE YOU

36:25.435 --> 36:26.268
SCARED?

36:26.703 --> 36:29.772
>> YOU KNOW I WAS SO ANGRY THAT
I REALLY THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE

36:29.872 --> 36:33.310
TRYING TO KEEP US FROM DOING OUR
JOB AND WE WERE THERE TO CERTIFY

36:33.410 --> 36:34.011
THE ELECTION.

36:34.111 --> 36:34.777
>> YEAH.

36:35.412 --> 36:41.417
>> WE COULD NOT LET THEM SCARE
US AWAY FROM THIS SYMBOL OF OUR

36:41.517 --> 36:44.421
DEMOCRACY.
I DIDN'T -- I NEVER REALLY GOT

36:44.520 --> 36:46.524
SCARED YESTERDAY.
THIS MORNING I MIGHT HAVE

36:46.623 --> 36:49.993
THOUGHT MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BUT NO.

36:50.095 --> 36:53.997
>> THERE WAS A DEBATE ABOUT
GOING BACK TO FINISH THE JOB?

36:54.098 --> 36:57.535
>> WHEN WE WERE IN THE ROOM AND
THEY MADE THE OFFICIAL ANOUNL

36:57.636 --> 37:00.538
NOUNSMENT WE WOULD RETURN TO THE
CAPITOL WHEN IT WAS SAFE AND

37:00.638 --> 37:02.975
FINISH BOTH SIDES WE WERE
GENUINELY THOUGHT IT WAS THE

37:03.075 --> 37:05.678
RIGHT THING TO DO.
THAT NONE OF US COULD BE KEPT

37:05.777 --> 37:08.247
FROM DOING OUR JOBS.
THAT WAS OUR JOB AND YOU SAW

37:08.348 --> 37:09.649
THAT IN VICE PRESIDENT PENCE.

37:09.750 --> 37:10.283
>> YEAH.

37:10.683 --> 37:13.386
>> YOU SAW IT IN SENATOR MITCH
McCONNELL.

37:13.486 --> 37:17.723
I MEAN, I THINK GENUINELY WE ALL
DID FEEL PART OF A COMMUNITY

37:17.823 --> 37:19.960
THAT HAVE A JOB TO DO.

37:20.060 --> 37:22.964
>> THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION
ABOUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

37:23.064 --> 37:24.665
SOMEONE CAN TAKE THE CAPITOL?

37:24.765 --> 37:28.368
>> I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE
SERIOUS INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHY

37:28.468 --> 37:31.406
IT HAPPENED.
FRANKLY, IT'S A NATIONAL

37:31.506 --> 37:33.475
SECURITY ISSUE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

37:33.575 --> 37:35.343
NATIONAL GUARD HAD NOT BEEN
DEPLOYED.

37:35.444 --> 37:38.881
AND HERE IS THE FACT, PRESIDENT
TRUMP WOULDN'T APPROVE IT.

37:38.980 --> 37:43.852
TOLD THE PENTAGON NOT TO APPROVE
IT WAS VICE PRESIDENT PENCE THAT

37:43.953 --> 37:46.823
ULTIMATELY GOT THE D.C. NATIONAL
GUARD HERE YESTERDAY.

37:46.922 --> 37:50.125
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T IN THE ROOM
WITH TRUMP BUT I DO KNOW THAT

37:50.225 --> 37:53.596
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE ROOM
WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO DID

37:53.696 --> 37:55.498
KNOW WHAT HE DID AND TOLD ME HE
DID IT.

37:55.598 --> 37:58.334
>> ONE LESSON WE LEARNED IN THE
TRUMP ERA IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU

37:58.435 --> 38:01.372
THINK YOU HAVE HIT BOTTOM, YOU
HAVEN'T HIT BOTTOM.

38:01.471 --> 38:02.772
RIGHT.
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE

38:02.872 --> 38:05.977
MIGHT DO AND WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS
MIGHT DO AND COLLECTIVELY WHAT

38:06.076 --> 38:09.781
THEY MIGHT DO BETWEEN NOW AND
INAUGURATION DAY?

38:09.881 --> 38:13.151
>> I THINK FOR THE NEXT 13 DAYS
WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTE VIGILANT

38:13.250 --> 38:15.220
SO THERE'S MORE DAMAGE TO OUR
DEMOCRACY.

38:15.319 --> 38:19.759
THE HATE THAT IS OUT THERE NOW,
JOHN, IT'S SCARY.

38:19.859 --> 38:30.370
IT'S A CANCER THAT WILL DESTROY
THIS COUNTRY.

38:30.470 --> 38:33.540
>> THIS WAS THE FIRST CAPITOL OF
THE UNITED STATES AFTER THE

38:33.640 --> 38:38.645
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
THIS IS WHERE WASHINGTON CAME TO

38:38.745 --> 38:41.216
RESIGN.
THIS IS GEORGE WASHINGTON'S

38:41.316 --> 38:44.651
ACTUALLY RESIGNATION SPEECH.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE

38:44.752 --> 38:46.921
EVER HAD A PEACEFUL TRANSITION
OF POWER IN AMERICA.

38:47.020 --> 38:53.027
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN
HISTORY THAT A GENERAL TURNED

38:53.127 --> 38:55.797
OVER POWER TO CITIZENS
REPRESENTATIVES.

38:55.897 --> 39:00.569
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
PEACEFULLY FOR 236 YEARS.

39:00.669 --> 39:04.640
UNTIL THIS YEAR.

39:04.741 --> 39:06.843
>> CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT
HAPPENED?

39:06.942 --> 39:12.147
>> WELL, IT WAS A CRAZY DAY.
I WAS ON A VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH

39:12.248 --> 39:16.888
THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR WHEN MY
CHIEF OF STAFF INTERRUPTED ME TO

39:16.988 --> 39:21.759
SAY THE U.S. CAPITOL WAS UNDER
ATTACK.

39:21.859 --> 39:25.296
I CALLED A SECURITY TEAM
BRIEFING AND WHILE I'M GOING

39:25.395 --> 39:30.401
THROUGH ALL OF THAT, I GOT A
CALL ON MY CELL PHONE.

39:30.502 --> 39:35.274
HE SAYS WE'RE IN AN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION WITH NANCY PELOSI AND

39:35.373 --> 39:37.576
CHUCK SCHUMER.
WE NEED HELP.

39:37.676 --> 39:41.314
AND I SAID, WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE MARYLAND

39:41.413 --> 39:43.116
STATE POLICE EN ROUTE TO THE
CITY.

39:43.216 --> 39:46.185
SOME ARE THERE.
MORE ARE COMING.

39:46.285 --> 39:47.352
I'VE ACTIVATED OUR MARYLAND
NATIONAL GUARD.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.455
>> CAN YOU HEAR NANCY PELOSI AND
SCHUMER?

39:49.555 --> 39:53.060
>> YEAH.
HOGAN SAYS THIS AND CHUCK SAYS

39:53.160 --> 39:57.598
THIS AND NANCY SAYS THIS.
I SAID, LOOK, WE'RE PREPARING.

39:57.698 --> 39:58.765
MOBILIZING.
COMING.

39:58.866 --> 40:01.468
WE HAVE TO GET THE SIGNOFF.
I CAN'T MOVE THEM ACROSS THE

40:01.569 --> 40:04.506
BORDER INTO D.C. WITHOUT THE
SIGNOFF FROM THE SECRETARY OF

40:04.605 --> 40:06.341
DEFENSE.
I FINALLY GOT A CALL 90 MINUTES

40:06.441 --> 40:07.676
LATER SAYING WE HAVE
AUTHORIZATION.

40:07.776 --> 40:10.611
SO I SAID, OKAY, WE'RE ON THE
WAY.

40:10.712 --> 40:15.051
>> IS THAT WHEN YOU DECIDED THAT
TRUMP SHOULD EITHER RESIGN, HAVE

40:15.151 --> 40:16.218
THE 25th AMENDMENT?

40:16.319 --> 40:18.888
>> I DIDN'T REALLY MAKE A
DECISION AND I DIDN'T ACTUALLY

40:18.988 --> 40:22.792
MAKE A STATEMENT.
IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A

40:22.892 --> 40:23.859
QUESTION.

40:24.127 --> 40:28.497
>> YES, LOOK HERE IS WHERE I AM.
I AM -- I THINK THERE'S NO

40:28.598 --> 40:32.669
QUESTION THAT AMERICA WOULD BE
BETTER OFF IF, UMM, THE

40:32.768 --> 40:36.640
PRESIDENT WOULD, UMM, RESIGN OR
BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE.

40:36.741 --> 40:39.944
IF MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONDUCT

40:40.044 --> 40:43.814
A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER
OVER THE NEXT 13 DAYS UNTIL

40:43.915 --> 40:50.422
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SWORN IN.

40:50.522 --> 40:51.622
>> I JUST SAID WHAT I FELT.
IT WASN'T LIKE LET ME DECIDE TO

40:51.723 --> 40:53.225
MAKE A STATEMENT.
IT WAS ANSWERING THE QUESTION

40:53.325 --> 40:53.892
HONESTLY.

40:54.526 --> 40:55.761
>> IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF
PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU,

40:55.861 --> 40:58.263
YOUR FATHER WAS A REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN FROM MARYLAND, ALSO,

40:58.364 --> 41:02.768
HE WAS THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO
COME OUT TO COURTS IMPEACHING

41:02.868 --> 41:04.604
PRESIDENT NIXON IN 1974.

41:04.703 --> 41:05.372
>> YEAH.

41:06.006 --> 41:09.375
>> HAS HE BEEN IN YOUR HEAD THE
LAST FOUR YEARS AS YOU'VE SEEN

41:09.475 --> 41:11.277
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR REPUBLICAN
PARTY?

41:11.379 --> 41:18.752
>> WELL, THERE ARE SOME
PARALLELS.

41:18.852 --> 41:21.622
>> PLEASE SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE.

41:21.723 --> 41:22.790
>> MR. HOGAN.

41:22.890 --> 41:23.859
>> AYE.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.928
>> HE WAS A NIXON SUPPORTER AND
LOYAL REPUBLICAN.

41:28.029 --> 41:31.366
HE SAW ALL THE EVIDENCE ON THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

41:31.466 --> 41:33.870
HE HAD A DIFFICULT DECISION AND
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, HARSHLY

41:33.970 --> 41:40.109
CRITICIZED BY HIS REPUBLICAN
COLLEAGUES BUT ALL THESE YEARS

41:40.209 --> 41:43.312
LATER IT'S THE THING HE'S MOST
REMEMBERED FOR AND, YOU KNOW,

41:43.413 --> 41:46.015
THERE'S NO QUESTION I THOUGHT
HIM A LOT OVER THE PAST FOUR

41:46.116 --> 41:49.085
YEARS AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM A
LOT OVER THE PAST WEEK.

41:49.185 --> 41:53.156
THIS WAS A HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BY DONALD

41:53.256 --> 41:56.261
TRUMP IN A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD LOST
THE PRESIDENCY, THE SENATE, AND

41:56.361 --> 41:58.430
THE HOUSE.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDS TO

41:58.529 --> 42:01.098
RETURN TO ITS ROOTS BUT THERE'S
A LOT OF PEOPLE FIGHTING TO KEEP

42:01.198 --> 42:04.334
DOING IT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN
DOING IT IN SPITE OF THE FACT

42:04.435 --> 42:09.875
IT'S BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BATTLE

42:09.975 --> 42:13.379
FOR THE SOUL OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.

42:13.479 --> 42:16.714
>> YOU THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YESTERDAY'S

42:16.816 --> 42:21.587
ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL.
GROWING CALLS SUMMON THE

42:21.687 --> 42:24.623
PRESIDENT TO BE IMPEACHED OR
REMOVED ON THE 25th AMENDMENT.

42:24.723 --> 42:27.460
>> ALLIES ARE A VANITY.

42:27.560 --> 42:31.698
>> THE PRESIDENT -- PART OF A
WAVE OF RESIGNATIONS WE'VE SEEN.

42:31.799 --> 42:35.770
>> SOME OF THE PRESIDENT'S USUAL
ALLIES WANT HIM TO RESIGN.

42:35.870 --> 42:37.471
>> MICK MULVANEY STEPPED DOWN.

42:37.571 --> 42:40.107
>> I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T STAY.

42:40.207 --> 42:42.544
>> FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL
BARR IS SAYING THE PRESIDENT

42:42.643 --> 42:45.647
ORCHESTRATED THIS MOB AND
BETRAYED HIS OFFICE.

42:45.747 --> 42:49.852
>> GENERAL JOHN KELLY, IF YOU
WERE IN THE CABINET NOW, WOULD

42:49.951 --> 42:54.357
YOU VOTE TO REMOVE HIM FROM
OFFICE?

42:54.457 --> 42:57.861
>> YES.
I WOULD.

42:57.960 --> 42:58.928
>> HEY, ALEX.

42:59.027 --> 42:59.863
>> YOU THERE?

42:59.962 --> 43:04.935
>> I'M HERE.
I'M IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST.

43:05.035 --> 43:08.705
>> THIS IS A VERY QUICKLY MOVING
WEATHER FRONT.

43:08.805 --> 43:09.272
RIGHT.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.576
>> WE SORT OF ANTICIPATED THIS
BUT I DON'T THINK WE REALLY

43:13.676 --> 43:19.683
UNDERSTOOD THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE
HE COULD DO.

43:19.783 --> 43:24.288
>> HE'S LOST RIGHT WING MEDIA,
HE'S LOST GOVERNORS, HE'S LOSING

43:24.388 --> 43:26.290
CABINET SECRETARIES.
NOW HE'S STARTING TO LOSE

43:26.390 --> 43:29.662
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY WHO ARE
GOING TO BE CRITICAL IN STAVING

43:29.761 --> 43:34.500
OFF AN IMPEACHMENT CHALLENGE.
LIKE, A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO,

43:34.600 --> 43:41.040
BEN SASSE OF NEBRASKA SAID, YOU
KNOW, I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO

43:41.140 --> 43:42.241
GET ON BOARD WITH IMPEACHMENT.

43:42.341 --> 43:43.442
>> HE SAID HE TALKED TO PEOPLE
AROUND TRUMP WHO SAID HE WAS

43:43.544 --> 43:45.879
ACTUALLY SORT OF PROACTIVELY
ENCOURAGING WHAT WAS HAPPENING

43:45.979 --> 43:48.448
IN THE CAPITOL.

43:48.549 --> 43:50.616
>> IF THERE WAS UNFOLDING ON
TELEVISION, DONALD TRUMP WAS

43:50.716 --> 43:53.721
WALKING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHY OTHER PEOPLE

43:53.821 --> 43:56.390
ON HIS TEAM WEREN'T AS EXCITED
AS HE WAS.

43:56.491 --> 44:01.361
>> HE MAY HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THE
SIGHT OF A MOB STORMING THE

44:01.462 --> 44:01.995
CAPITOL.

44:02.631 --> 44:04.299
>> CLEARLY PEOPLE WANTED TRUMP
TO DO OR SAY SOMETHING.

44:04.399 --> 44:07.335
HE WAS RESISTANT TO IT BUT
FINALLY PUT OUT A VIDEO WHICH

44:07.435 --> 44:09.004
WAS LIKE A HOSTAGE VIDEO.

44:09.104 --> 44:12.607
>> TO THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN THE
ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND

44:12.707 --> 44:16.312
DESTRUCTION, YOU DO NOT
REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY.

44:16.413 --> 44:18.515
TO THOSE WHO BROKE THE LAW, YOU
WILL PAY.

44:18.614 --> 44:22.484
>> MAYBE WE'RE SAYING HE ONLY
DID IT FOR LEGAL LIABILITY

44:22.585 --> 44:23.152
PURPOSES.

44:23.886 --> 44:26.591
>> THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL
BE INAUGURATED ON JANUARY 20th.

44:26.691 --> 44:30.962
MY FOCUS NOW TURNS TO ENSURING A
SMOOTH, ORDERLY, AND SEAMLESS

44:31.062 --> 44:32.230
TRANSITION OF POWER.

44:32.330 --> 44:34.698
>> AND CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
CONVINCE ANYBODY THAT HE REALLY

44:34.799 --> 44:39.238
GIVES A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING BUT
HIMSELF.

44:39.337 --> 44:42.908
>> ONE WONDERS IS THIS REALLY
TRULY THE END OF HIM BEING

44:43.008 --> 44:47.178
PUBLICLY ACCEPTED BY MOST OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY?

44:47.279 --> 44:53.486
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
DOUBT HE'LL MAINTAIN A LOYAL

44:53.585 --> 44:55.754
FOLLOWING TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
BUT THE NOTION HE'LL BE THE

44:55.855 --> 44:59.826
POWER HE WAS IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IS A --

44:59.926 --> 45:03.096
>> OUR DISCUSSIONS AMONG SOME
CABINET MEMBERS ABOUT INVOKING

45:03.196 --> 45:04.364
THE 25th AMENDMENT.

45:04.464 --> 45:09.502
>> MIKE PENCE COULD DECIDE TO
INVOKE THE 25th.

45:09.602 --> 45:13.540
>> A STRUGGLE FOR ME IS WATCHING
SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO

45:13.642 --> 45:18.712
NAVIGATE THE CHAOS JUST LIKE THE
REST OF US.

45:18.812 --> 45:26.922
AND TRYING TO DO AT TIMES THE
RIGHT THING IN A HARD SITUATION.

45:27.022 --> 45:32.093
>> TELL US HOW YOU CAME TO?

45:32.194 --> 45:35.299
>> IT WAS REALLY HARD DECISIONS.
I CARED ABOUT HELPING THE PEOPLE

45:35.399 --> 45:38.134
IN THE CDC.
I CARED ABOUT TRYING TO HELP

45:38.234 --> 45:41.805
THEM NAVIGATE SITUATIONS WHEN
THERE WERE POLITICAL PEOPLE

45:41.904 --> 45:45.408
CHANTING THE GUIDELINES THAT I
KNEW COULD POSSIBLY HURT

45:45.509 --> 45:48.613
AMERICANS.
AND I REALIZED THE DYNAMICS WERE

45:48.712 --> 45:52.817
SO CHALLENGING THAT I FELT LIKE
I COULD NO LONGER MAKE A

45:52.917 --> 45:53.551
DIFFERENCE.

45:54.151 --> 45:55.218
>> WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO
PEOPLE LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE

45:55.319 --> 45:58.357
NOW LIKE IN THE LAST 24/48
HOURS?

45:58.457 --> 46:00.759
THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO
CALLED ME A TRAITOR.

46:00.859 --> 46:03.895
ALL THOUGH I APPRECIATE THE FACT
THEY ARE DRAWING THE LINE FOR

46:03.995 --> 46:09.935
THEMSELVES FINALLY, I WILL SAY
YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME

46:10.035 --> 46:14.941
FORWARD AND YOU WAITED UNTIL THE
CAPITOL WAS RANSACKED AND

46:15.040 --> 46:18.845
ATTACKED AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
TOOK THIS TO FINALLY HAPPEN

46:18.944 --> 46:21.716
WHERE YOU DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT
I DID WAS OKAY, PERHAPS.

46:21.816 --> 46:24.752
>> RIGHT.

46:24.852 --> 46:28.522
>> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
OBSERVATIONS OF THIS WEEK AND

46:28.622 --> 46:31.258
WHAT MIKE PENCE IS GOING
THROUGH.

46:31.359 --> 46:34.763
>> YOU KNOW HE IS VERY LOYAL TO
THE PRESIDENT.

46:34.863 --> 46:38.734
TO A FLAW, I WOULD SAY.
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS GIVE HIM

46:38.834 --> 46:42.738
CREDIT, EVEN WHEN IT WAS SO
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT DID

46:42.837 --> 46:44.439
NOT DO THE THINGS HE WAS GIVING
HIM CREDIT FOR.

46:44.540 --> 46:45.607
>> YEAH.

46:45.875 --> 46:51.147
>> SO WHEN HE GAVE THAT SPEECH,
I REMEMBER THINKING HE IS ANGRY.

46:51.247 --> 46:54.984
THAT IS THE MOST ANGER I'VE SEEN
OUT OF MIKE PENCE PROBABLY IN MY

46:55.084 --> 46:57.421
ENTIRE TENURE WHILE WORKING WITH
HIM.

46:57.520 --> 47:01.792
HE COULD HAVE DONE A CURVE BALL
AND DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO BE

47:01.892 --> 47:05.729
LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT BUT HE
DIDN'T.

47:05.828 --> 47:07.431
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T RIGHT

47:07.531 --> 47:10.000
EVERYTHING THAT HE WENT ALONG
WITH BUT HE NEEDED TO DO WHAT

47:10.100 --> 47:12.002
WAS RIGHT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY.

47:12.102 --> 47:16.140
>> DO YOU THINK HE HAS ANY
REGRETS GIVEN HOW LOYAL HE'S

47:16.241 --> 47:20.111
BEEN AND THE WAY HE WAS TREATED
THIS WEEK BY THE PRESIDENT?

47:20.212 --> 47:23.748
>> KNOWS IT'S A MATTER IF NOT
THE BUS IS COMING BUT A MATTER

47:23.848 --> 47:26.051
OF WHEN.
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY

47:26.151 --> 47:27.285
VINDICTIVE.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.221
HE'S SHOWN IT.
I WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN THE

47:29.321 --> 47:35.060
PRESIDENT STARTED TO, YOU KNOW,
TWEETING ABOUT MIKE PENCE.

47:35.162 --> 47:40.000
I WAS APPALLED THAT ONE OF HIS
LAWYERS WAS CALLING FOR THE ASAN

47:40.100 --> 47:43.604
NATION OF A -- ASSASSINATION OF
A SITTING VICE PRESIDENT VIA

47:43.703 --> 47:45.138
TWITTER.
THAT'S HORRIFYING TO WATCH

47:45.238 --> 47:47.741
SOMEONE THAT IS CLOSE TO THE
PRESIDENT AND THE UNITED STATES

47:47.841 --> 47:52.013
ASKING FOR HIS OWN VICE
PRESIDENT TO BE ASSASSINATED.

47:52.113 --> 47:54.783
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAYS.

47:54.883 --> 47:58.921
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT CAN INVOKE
THE 25th AMENDMENT, YOU THINK

47:59.020 --> 47:59.754
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY?

47:59.855 --> 48:02.290
>> I WANT TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD.

48:02.390 --> 48:03.357
>> YOU THINK HE SHOULD?

48:03.459 --> 48:07.596
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS MAN

48:07.696 --> 48:10.533
STILL HAS ACCESS TO THE NUCLEAR
CODES.

48:10.633 --> 48:14.337
THAT I THINK 2024 IS COMING UP
AND I DO THINK THAT THE VICE

48:14.437 --> 48:17.707
PRESIDENT WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT
AND I THINK HE'LL RUN AND I

48:17.808 --> 48:20.243
REALLY THINK THAT IS THE
QUESTION FOR THE REPUBLICAN

48:20.343 --> 48:22.011
PARTY.
WHO IS THE BASE OF THE

48:22.111 --> 48:24.781
REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW?
AND I DO BELIEVE IT'S THE TRUMP

48:24.881 --> 48:25.883
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW.

48:25.982 --> 48:26.783
>> RIGHT.

48:26.884 --> 48:28.285
>> AND THEY'RE WATCHING HIS
EVERY MOVE.

48:28.386 --> 48:31.922
>> DO YOU THINK A LOT OF -- MIKE
PENCE?

48:32.022 --> 48:34.892
>> HE DID NOT GO ALONG WITH WHAT
THEY WANTED HIM TO DO.

48:34.993 --> 48:38.730
>> DO YOU THINK BY NOT INVOKING
THE 25th AMENDMENT, IT'S AN

48:38.830 --> 48:42.368
ATTEMPT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT TO
REGAIN SOME OF THEIR TRUST?

48:42.468 --> 48:43.468
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO HAVE HIS

48:43.569 --> 48:48.373
CAKE AND EAT IT, TOO.

48:48.473 --> 48:51.712
>> THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
PREVENTED.

48:51.812 --> 48:56.649
WE KNOW HOW TO PROTECT THE
PERIMETER OF THE U.S. CAPITOL

48:56.750 --> 48:59.453
GROUNDS.
FOUR YEARS AGO AT THE

48:59.553 --> 49:03.790
INAUGURATION, JANUARY 2017, AS
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

49:03.892 --> 49:07.328
I HAD OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE SECURITY OF THAT EVENT.

49:07.428 --> 49:11.232
I USED TO TELL PEOPLE IN
HOMELAND SECURITY DON'T JUST

49:11.332 --> 49:14.569
PLAN FOR THE LAST ATTACK.
BE PREPARED TO THINK ABOUT THE

49:14.669 --> 49:17.006
NEXT ATTACK.
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY WAS,

49:17.105 --> 49:26.716
FRANKLY, A FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE
THE OBVIOUS.

49:26.816 --> 49:31.520
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VIRAL
VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT SEEM

49:31.620 --> 49:36.292
TO SUGGEST THAT SOME, CERTAINLY
NOT ALL, OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD

49:36.392 --> 49:39.730
A CERTAIN KINSHIP, IF NOT
COMRADERY WITH THE MOB THAT WAS

49:39.830 --> 49:50.008
STORMING THE CAPITOL.

49:50.107 --> 49:53.979
>>WELL, IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY'RE

49:54.078 --> 49:55.948
DEDICATED, THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL,
THEY'RE PREPARED TO PUT THEIR

49:56.047 --> 50:00.085
OWN LIVES ON THE LINE.
I THINK WE NEED TO EXAMINE

50:00.185 --> 50:03.922
WHETHER THERE'S A STRAND OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT THAT SOMEHOW DID NOT

50:04.022 --> 50:07.493
TAKE THIS SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS.

50:07.593 --> 50:10.830
>> IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT
HAPPENED THIS WEEK AND LOOKING

50:10.930 --> 50:14.201
DOWN THE BARREL OF THE NEXT 12
DAYS, WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN?

50:14.301 --> 50:19.973
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE
TRAGEDY THE OTHER DAY WAS IT.

50:20.073 --> 50:27.314
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY
CONCERNED FOR ANOTHER MATCH

50:27.415 --> 50:31.685
BEING LIT, FOR KEROSENE BEING
THROWN ON THE FIRE, AND SO

50:31.785 --> 50:32.988
THEY'RE GOING TO BE VIGILANT.

50:33.087 --> 50:35.491
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
HEAR YOUR COMMENTS AND THEY ARE

50:35.591 --> 50:38.026
BEGIN TO BE SCARED FOR THE
INCOMING PRESIDENT.

50:38.127 --> 50:40.629
ARE YOU SCARED?

50:40.730 --> 50:46.268
>> I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE
NEXT 12 DAYS.

50:46.370 --> 50:51.207
IF I WERE STILL IN OFFICE AND I
HAD THE ABILITY, WHICH I DON'T,

50:51.308 --> 50:56.212
TO INFLUENCE THE PERSONAL
BEHAVIOR OF THIS PRESIDENT, I

50:56.312 --> 51:02.352
WOULD BE SAYING, FRANKLY, YOU'VE
GOT A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO

51:02.453 --> 51:03.855
NOT DAMAGE THE SITUATION
FURTHER.

51:03.955 --> 51:11.363
GET ON MARINE 1 RIGHT NOW, GO TO
MAR-A-LAGO, AND DON'T COME BACK.

51:11.462 --> 51:15.366
>> WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BREATHE A
SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER THE

51:15.466 --> 51:19.104
PRESIDENT-ELECT PUT HIS HAND ON
THE BIBLE AND SWORN TO UPHOLD

51:19.203 --> 51:20.806
THE OATH OF OFFICE.

51:20.906 --> 51:28.415
>> IN MANY RESPECTS, YES.
BUT TRUMPISM, THAT STRAND OF

51:28.515 --> 51:34.654
PEOPLE WHO SAW RAID AND LOOT THE
U.S. CAPITOL ARE ARE NOT GOING

51:34.754 --> 51:38.292
AWAY.
AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

51:38.392 --> 51:41.629
WHO RIGHT NOW BELIEVE THAT THE
ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM.

51:41.729 --> 51:45.433
BELIEVE ALL THE FAKE NEWS THAT
IS OUT THERE.

51:45.533 --> 51:48.335
THERE'S A STRAND OF PEOPLE
PREPARED TO TAKE TO THE STREETS

51:48.437 --> 51:55.977
ON BEHALF OF TRUMP.
THIS WAS TRUMPISM BOILED OVER

51:56.078 --> 51:56.212
AND

51:56.212 --> 51:56.312
AND DONALD

51:56.312 --> 51:56.379
AND DONALD TRUMP

51:56.379 --> 52:23.540
AND DONALD TRUMP LIT
