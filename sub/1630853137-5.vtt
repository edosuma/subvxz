WEBVTT

00:05.208 --> 00:06.375
Do you know Ammit?

00:06.458 --> 00:10.625
Egyptian deity, right?
World's first bogeyman.

00:10.708 --> 00:14.416
- The justice of Ammit surveys
the whole of our lives.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.875
That's why we have to resurrect her.

00:16.958 --> 00:19.625
And she'll light the path
to heal the world.

00:19.708 --> 00:22.333
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

00:27.083 --> 00:30.083
Now, he's tethered to this place.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.833
It's gotta be one of the big'uns.

00:34.125 --> 00:35.250
We won.

00:38.416 --> 00:39.625
Steven.

00:39.958 --> 00:43.625
-You know Steven?
-Of course I know Steven.

00:43.958 --> 00:46.375
-If we can't calmly...

00:48.875 --> 00:51.250
-- Marc? Marc!
-Steven!

00:51.333 --> 00:52.458
We gotta get out of here.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.208
Hi.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.541
- Help!

01:50.083 --> 01:54.041
This is all your fault!

01:57.416 --> 01:59.833
DR.- Calm down. Marc? Marc.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.166
I didn't shoot you.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.291
Your mind is violently vacillating between

02:04.375 --> 02:06.458
sense and nonsense.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.583
Picture this, all right?
Your brain is a pendulum,

02:09.666 --> 02:13.541
swinging between a very difficult reality,

02:13.625 --> 02:17.000
that you are my patient
here at Putnam Medical Facility

02:17.083 --> 02:18.791
in Chicago, Illinois,

02:18.916 --> 02:24.166
and a reassuring fantasy
that you've created on your own.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.791
That you're some kind of,
I don't know, superhero. All right?

02:27.875 --> 02:32.000
You are doing everything and
everything possible not to look within.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.833
You're not really a doctor.

02:34.750 --> 02:38.083
DR.- Is that why you keep starting
imaginary fights in our hospital?

02:38.166 --> 02:39.416
No, you're not a doctor.

02:40.750 --> 02:44.000
Look. I feel real.
I feel like a real doctor.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.166
You're not a doctor.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.625
Well, all right.

02:47.875 --> 02:51.041
I'm not a real doctor.
Okay, well, all right, all right.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.208
It's not about me, okay?

02:54.583 --> 02:57.250
Let's start with you.
Let's try it your way. Retrace your steps.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.916
Tell me. Tell me.
How did you come to be here today?

03:01.250 --> 03:02.583
How did you get here?

03:04.208 --> 03:05.208
I took the bus,

03:05.916 --> 03:07.250
like I always do.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.916
You wanna know what you told me,
how you got here?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.458
You told me that you were in a place
that was oddly reminiscent of this office,

03:14.541 --> 03:20.000
except that it was in Egypt, right?
And that you were with a rhinoceros

03:20.291 --> 03:22.000
-and...
-Hippopotamus.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.083
You're right, I'm...
You're right, it was a hippopotamus,

03:25.208 --> 03:26.625
but it talked.

03:29.916 --> 03:33.625
Now, what do you think?
Do you think that is sense

03:34.416 --> 03:35.625
or nonsense?

03:39.541 --> 03:40.541
Nonsense?

03:41.625 --> 03:43.291
I find this really encouraging.

03:43.916 --> 03:46.166
Honestly, I do.

03:47.375 --> 03:50.750
The struggling mind
will often build places

03:51.000 --> 03:54.375
to seek shelter
for different aspects of the self

03:54.458 --> 03:56.291
from our most traumatic memories.

03:56.666 --> 03:59.375
It's called just
an organizing principle, okay?

03:59.458 --> 04:02.333
Some people, they see a castle, right?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.833
Somebody else will see a maze,
or a library.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.958
Or a... psych ward?

04:09.791 --> 04:16.166
Yeah. Or it could be.
Could be a psych ward. Yeah.

04:16.250 --> 04:22.833
What I find extremely interesting
is this new... The new animal character.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.208
Um...

04:24.666 --> 04:27.791
-Hippopotamus?
-I find that really interesting.

04:28.333 --> 04:32.041
This hippo could break down the walls
between you and Steven,

04:32.125 --> 04:34.083
and we might finally understand.

04:36.625 --> 04:37.708
Understand what?

04:38.166 --> 04:42.916
Well, before you got upset,
you were talking to me about a boy.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.958
-Do you remember that boy?
-Mmm-hmm.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.583
You think you could tell me
about that little boy?

04:53.791 --> 04:56.416
Hey, thank you. I feel really great.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.541
Yeah.

04:57.625 --> 05:01.083
I mean, they must pay you
a lot of money in this place.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.708
-You know what?
-You're really good.

05:02.791 --> 05:05.583
I tell you what, I feel like
a million dollars, never felt so good.

05:05.666 --> 05:08.500
I'm gonna see myself out. Thank you.
Doctor! No, you're not...

05:08.583 --> 05:11.541
You're gonna release that monster...
He's gonna destroy everything!

05:11.625 --> 05:14.125
-He's gonna destroy everything!
-Be gentle with him!

05:14.208 --> 05:16.041
Listen, I am not your enemy!

05:16.125 --> 05:18.375
No! No!

05:20.916 --> 05:22.000
Hippo! Hippo!

05:22.083 --> 05:23.458
Oh, man!

05:23.833 --> 05:25.666
Wow, these meds are really amazing.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.750
Is he always so intense?

05:28.833 --> 05:30.791
Who, him? Yeah, pretty much.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.416
- So, are you two, like, twins?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.125
-No.
-Well, yes, sort of.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.833
- Okay, great.

05:36.916 --> 05:39.166
That's really cleared this
whole situation up for me.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.250
That makes two of us.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.791
Just a second ago,
I thought I'd been shot to death.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.666
Oh, gosh!
This will really bake your noodle,

05:45.750 --> 05:47.958
but I think you were just taking
a little time-out.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.666
I'm afraid you're actually quite dead.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.250
I'm sorry, what?

05:53.541 --> 05:54.541
But...

05:55.625 --> 05:57.166
I'm dead? We're dead?

05:57.416 --> 05:58.416
Yes.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.333
Yes, Marc. I think she's right.

06:01.416 --> 06:03.916
I think we died.

06:04.916 --> 06:07.875
- I actually... I have...
Hold on a sec.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.625
It's been a minute
since we've had a soul pass through here.

06:10.708 --> 06:14.500
Bit distracted... Excuse me.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.958
A-ha! Okay, here we go.

06:24.958 --> 06:29.000
Welcome, gentle traveler... Travelers,

06:29.291 --> 06:31.458
to the realm of the Duat.

06:31.541 --> 06:33.875
Duat? The Egyptian underworld.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.666
This is Taweret,

06:35.750 --> 06:38.208
-goddess of women and children...
-- Uh-huh.

06:38.375 --> 06:41.833
...and she's guiding us through
our journey to the afterlife.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.125
-Wow.
-- Okay.

06:45.125 --> 06:50.125
Right. So, this is the afterlife?

06:50.375 --> 06:54.791
-The afterlife?
-An afterlife. Not the afterlife.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.500
You'd be surprised how many
intersectional planes

06:57.583 --> 06:59.875
-of untethered consciousness exist.
-Yeah.

07:00.083 --> 07:04.666
Like the Ancestral Plane.
Oh! Just gorgeous. Anyway.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.291
I do actually have cards for all this

07:07.375 --> 07:10.541
if you just wait, and... I'm sorry.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.208
Wait... Bye.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.875
Okay, so...

07:15.958 --> 07:19.666
Because the Duat's true nature
is impossible for the human mind

07:19.750 --> 07:20.833
-to comprehend...
-Right.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.708
...you may perceive this realm
as something

07:23.791 --> 07:25.625
more easily recognizable to you.

07:26.041 --> 07:29.041
-Uh-huh.
-A psych ward's a first for me,

07:29.125 --> 07:32.166
but, hey, we can roll with it, right?

07:33.166 --> 07:36.416
Why would we imagine this realm
to be a psychiatric hospital?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.208
Because we're insane.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.375
We're insane.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.458
This talking hippo,

07:48.166 --> 07:51.833
talking dead bird,
you're outside of my body now.

07:51.916 --> 07:54.000
And now the afterlife, right?

07:54.083 --> 07:57.083
-That's the reality and this...
-- But Marc, Marc.

07:57.166 --> 08:01.083
The hospital. That's the imagination.

08:02.125 --> 08:05.583
-Sorry, he's...
-Oh, man. Dr. Harrow's right.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.166
Dr. Harrow?

08:08.208 --> 08:09.833
This is an organizing principle.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.125
-Is he a doctor now?
-- I'll prove it you.

08:12.208 --> 08:15.125
So, like, right through these doors,
for example,

08:15.208 --> 08:17.333
we go through here,
there's gonna be patients,

08:17.416 --> 08:20.750
and there's Crawley
probably about to yell bingo!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.333
Oh, my God!

08:22.958 --> 08:24.000
Oh, my God!

08:31.541 --> 08:32.666
What is this?

08:32.750 --> 08:34.000
This is the underworld.

08:34.708 --> 08:35.958
I'm not crazy.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.583
I'm dead.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.500
-Where did you say we're going?
-We're sailing to A'aru.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.416
To the Field of Reeds, right, Taweret?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.458
Ah, so he's the smart one, hey?

08:45.541 --> 08:50.416
Well, if your heart's balanced in life,
then you will spend eternity in paradise.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.375
The Field of Reeds.

08:52.791 --> 08:57.583
But before we get there,
I've just got to do a quick little...

09:00.333 --> 09:03.750
-Whoa! Easy! Easy, easy, easy there!

09:04.916 --> 09:07.666
Oh, goody! It worked! Look at that!

09:08.000 --> 09:11.666
Here was little old me worrying I'd blow
your chests wide open.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.041
- Sorry, what?

09:13.666 --> 09:14.833
- Wait, what's she doing?

09:14.916 --> 09:18.208
- She's weighing our hearts
on the Scales of Justice

09:18.291 --> 09:19.583
and the Feather of Truth.

09:19.666 --> 09:22.375
You see, the ancient Egyptians believed
that the heart

09:22.458 --> 09:25.125
was the sign of
who you really were in life.

09:25.583 --> 09:28.500
If the Scales balance
by the time you end the journey,

09:28.583 --> 09:31.458
then a soul is permitted to pass
into the Field of Reeds.

09:31.833 --> 09:35.250
-- What if they don't balance?
-You get thrown overboard. Whoo!

09:36.166 --> 09:37.958
The dead will drag you down into the Duat,

09:38.041 --> 09:41.166
where you will remain forever,
frozen in sand.

09:41.958 --> 09:45.416
No unbalanced souls on my boat.
Them's the rules.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.416
Fingers crossed for you guys, hey?

09:49.041 --> 09:52.416
I don't care what this hippo says.
There's no way we're ending up down there.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.625
And we're not going to
the Field of Reeds, either.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.458
-All right. What are you proposing?
-If it comes to it,

09:58.625 --> 10:00.291
kill the hippo, steal the boat.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.375
Kill?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.958
-Um, fellas?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.500
What? Why is it doing that?
Why is it moving like that?

10:10.583 --> 10:14.916
- I don't know.
I do not have a card for this.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.583
Oh. It's the hearts.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.208
They aren't full.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.291
And trust me, I'm a goblet half-full
kind of gal, but...

10:27.916 --> 10:29.875
It's like they each feel incomplete.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.041
What does that mean?

10:31.125 --> 10:35.125
Without balanced Scales,
the Duat will eventually claim your soul.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.083
Do you have any other suggestions?

10:39.541 --> 10:42.000
This boat contains
all of a life's memories.

10:42.083 --> 10:45.458
Now I don't know what you two guys
have been hiding, but my advice,

10:45.708 --> 10:48.250
get in there
and show each other the truth.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.541
Balance your Scales before
we arrive at the Field of Reeds,

10:51.708 --> 10:53.833
or your souls will be destroyed.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.000
-- Yeah, all right.
-So how are we supposed to do this?

10:57.458 --> 11:00.416
Not sure. You think Layla's all right?

11:01.166 --> 11:02.416
Yeah, for now.

11:02.916 --> 11:06.458
And knowing her, she'll go on
a suicide mission to stop Harrow herself.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.041
That means we better hurry, doesn't it?

11:09.125 --> 11:11.041
Know what Layla would be all right with?

11:11.125 --> 11:13.541
-Don't. Just don't say it.
-I'm just saying there is

11:13.625 --> 11:15.166
one hippo and two of us,

11:15.250 --> 11:17.458
and this ship can't be
that hard to steer. So...

11:17.541 --> 11:20.833
-And we don't have to actually...
-Have to what? Kill the Goddess Taweret?

11:20.916 --> 11:23.041
No, just, you know, find me a rope and...

11:23.125 --> 11:24.833
Yeah. Or we can do what she says,

11:24.916 --> 11:28.291
and help each other uncover whatever it is
that we're hiding, apparently.

11:28.375 --> 11:32.583
Steven, I don't know about you,
but my memories are a fricking mess.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.375
-Yeah, mine, too.

11:49.791 --> 11:50.875
- Whoa.

11:51.750 --> 11:52.791
That's wild.

11:58.833 --> 11:59.875
- Oi. What's this?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.500
Steven, what are we gonna do here?

12:01.583 --> 12:04.083
We're gonna
revisit every single memory I've ever had?

12:06.583 --> 12:08.708
Do you... Do you remember this?

12:11.125 --> 12:13.791
Yeah. I don't know,
it's just a street, you know.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.166
How many streets
have you walked down your whole life?

12:17.750 --> 12:19.666
- Help!

12:20.541 --> 12:21.666
Did you hear that?

12:27.708 --> 12:28.708
- Hey.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.333
- Just a creepy caff
filled with dead bodies.

12:36.416 --> 12:40.166
That's all it is. No prizes guessing
whose room this is.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.250
-Yours.
-Funny.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.458
Dubai.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.125
Gabon.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.708
New York. No way.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.875
Oh, man.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.875
- What, do you know these people?

13:16.291 --> 13:18.166
No. Oh, no.

13:18.333 --> 13:21.583
Surely not all of them?

13:22.416 --> 13:24.375
You killed all of them?

13:25.125 --> 13:29.041
They were criminals. Murderers. Predators.
The worst of the worst.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.500
Khonshu wanted them punished.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.416
It's what he meant by
protecting the travelers of the night.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.333
- And you remember each person?

13:35.416 --> 13:36.791
You try taking a life.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.666
See how quickly you forget.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.833
Kept wishing I'd fail
and one of them would kill me instead.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.041
-The healing ended up being a curse.
-Marc!

13:51.416 --> 13:52.666
Do you see this? Look.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.791
The Scales are slowing down. It's working.

13:55.875 --> 13:59.708
Okay, all right. So then, now what?
What do we do? Do you go next?

13:59.791 --> 14:01.166
Um... Who's that?

14:08.166 --> 14:09.166
Marc,

14:10.333 --> 14:14.541
why is there a child in a room filled
with people that you've killed?

14:16.291 --> 14:18.916
-Steven, look, don't go near him.
-Hey, little man.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.416
What's your name, there?
Oh, hold on there.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.583
-Wait a moment.
-Steven. Wait! Wait!

14:28.208 --> 14:29.791
Come on! No, wait! Steven! Steven!

14:32.291 --> 14:35.291
Open the door! Open the door!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.791
-Open the door!
-Mom?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.375
Food's ready. Who's hungry? RoRo?

14:46.458 --> 14:48.000
Mom, come check out my drawing.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.041
- He drew the fish
with only one fin.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.000
Marc, be nice to your little brother.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.750
I had a brother?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.041
I'm not hungry. Want to go to the cave?

14:58.291 --> 14:59.666
We'll eat later.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.208
Boys? Don't be gone too long.

15:02.541 --> 15:05.166
Hey, hey, hey, Marc. What do you do?

15:05.750 --> 15:07.833
Keep an eye on your brother. Okay?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.333
Laters, gators.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.208
In a while, crocodile.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.416
Where'd they go?

15:20.458 --> 15:21.958
Let's do it. Let's go.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.916
- Okay. Okay, okay, fine, but...

15:25.416 --> 15:26.833
I'll be Rosser, though.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.750
Can you hear that, Dr. Grant?

15:29.875 --> 15:31.458
I sure do, Rosser.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.708
Sounds to me like danger.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.708
-Dr. Grant?

15:36.833 --> 15:38.708
Mom said not to when it's raining.

15:38.791 --> 15:40.666
It'll be fine. Don't be a baby.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.250
- That was awesome.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.125
Oh.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.833
Oh, God. Oh, no.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.333
Lads?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.958
You have to get out of here!

16:21.625 --> 16:22.916
Boys?

16:24.208 --> 16:25.625
Don't go any further!

16:26.083 --> 16:28.125
The water's rising way too fast!

16:29.500 --> 16:31.125
You got to get out of here.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.208
Boys?

16:35.166 --> 16:36.583
Where are they?

16:39.291 --> 16:41.583
- Steven? Come back here!

16:42.875 --> 16:44.000
- Boys?

16:45.833 --> 16:48.750
Come on, lads. We have to leave now!

16:48.916 --> 16:51.375
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

16:52.458 --> 16:53.875
-Where are you?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.041
- Marc! Marc!

16:56.875 --> 16:59.166
-Help us, please! Help us.
-Marc! Oh, God.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.458
-- RoRo!
-Follow my voice!

17:01.625 --> 17:03.041
-Boys!
-- Mommy!

17:03.125 --> 17:05.416
-Mommy! I want my mommy!
-- No. No, no, no.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.041
- I hear you!

17:07.250 --> 17:08.541
-- Mommy!
-I hear you, Marc!

17:08.625 --> 17:09.750
- RoRo!

17:10.791 --> 17:13.291
-It's just a memory. It is just a memory.
-Help!

17:13.375 --> 17:14.583
-- Mommy!
-Damn it, Steven.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.083
Hey, Steven.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.333
- I want my RoRo back.

18:01.041 --> 18:04.125
I want him back.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.791
What are you doing here? Hmm?

18:21.041 --> 18:22.083
- Come on, buddy.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.583
You were supposed to keep him safe!

18:24.666 --> 18:25.708
Steven, let's go.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.916
- You let him drown.

18:30.708 --> 18:34.041
This is all your fault!

18:34.166 --> 18:37.041
This is all your fault!

18:38.833 --> 18:40.416
-Hey, Steven. Come here.

18:40.958 --> 18:43.250
Come here! Stop, stop! Don't go up there!

18:43.666 --> 18:44.666
Stop!

18:44.750 --> 18:47.166
- Wendy? Wendy, come on, please.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.541
Wendy, please.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.166
We're just about to blow out
the candles now.

19:01.083 --> 19:02.125
She's not coming.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.375
Your mother's not feeling well, Marc.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.666
We'll do it just you and I this year.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.291
Okay?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
- Steven!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.333
Steven!

19:33.958 --> 19:36.583
You can't have a birthday
without your favorite cake!

19:38.333 --> 19:40.041
Get started on these, okay, son?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.416
- You were always jealous of him.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.875
Ever since he was born.

19:56.708 --> 19:57.833
I...

19:57.916 --> 20:01.166
I should've known
you would do something like this.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.458
Mum, what are you doing?

20:14.458 --> 20:15.458
- Steven!

20:24.208 --> 20:26.208
What happened in that room, Marc?

20:27.083 --> 20:29.541
-That's it, Steven. That's it.
-All right! All right.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.125
Why are you remembering her like that?

20:32.208 --> 20:33.791
That's not what she was like.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.875
No. Let me go. Let me back in there.
What are you hiding?

20:37.958 --> 20:39.291
What are you hiding?

20:39.375 --> 20:41.958
- Marc, son. Please come inside.

20:42.666 --> 20:43.791
She will get help.

20:43.875 --> 20:44.875
Dad.

20:44.958 --> 20:47.833
-We will fix this.
-You're supposed to fix this.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.625
I mean... Why haven't you?

20:54.666 --> 20:56.166
I cannot lose another son.

20:56.625 --> 20:57.708
Please.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.458
Please...

21:02.625 --> 21:04.041
- That's enough, Steven.

21:05.416 --> 21:06.666
Get off me!

21:15.250 --> 21:16.625
Where the hell are we now?

21:23.333 --> 21:24.416
Oh, God.

21:27.958 --> 21:31.041
-Harrow said you were a mercenary.

21:34.041 --> 21:37.083
That you killed hostages.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.791
-And you believe that?
-Yeah. Wouldn't put it past you.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.875
- Turns out going AWOL
in a fugue state

21:48.958 --> 21:50.708
gets you discharged from the military.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.666
Didn't have a ton of options after that,

21:52.750 --> 21:54.916
so I went work-for-hire
for my old CO Bushman.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.666
The job was to raid an Egyptian tomb.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.125
But Bushman changed the plan,

22:01.083 --> 22:03.333
called for no witnesses,
and I couldn't live with that.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.458
- Is that Doctor El Faouly?

22:05.583 --> 22:06.708
Layla's dad?

22:09.166 --> 22:12.083
I tried to get them all away.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.291
But we didn't make it.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.125
Clearly.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.500
What happened to you?

23:19.375 --> 23:21.375
- What a waste.

23:23.708 --> 23:24.791
Huh?

23:25.208 --> 23:28.541
I feel the pain inside of you.

23:29.416 --> 23:30.416
Ah.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.458
Hmm.

23:33.166 --> 23:36.083
What the hell are you?

23:37.125 --> 23:39.958
I am the god Khonshu,

23:40.250 --> 23:42.750
in search of a warrior.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.250
- A warrior.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.291
Well, good luck with that.

23:47.750 --> 23:52.666
- To be my hands,
my eyes, my vengeance.

23:53.541 --> 23:57.791
To be my final word against the evildoers.

23:57.875 --> 24:01.333
To bind your very being to me

24:01.458 --> 24:06.750
and eradicate only the worst,
those who deserve it.

24:07.041 --> 24:08.708
Do you want death

24:09.666 --> 24:11.083
or do you want life?

24:12.916 --> 24:14.125
I don't know.

24:14.541 --> 24:20.541
Your mind, I feel it. Fractured. Broken.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.166
Most fascinating.

24:24.083 --> 24:29.291
You are a worthy candidate
to serve me during this time.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.583
In exchange for your life,

24:34.500 --> 24:38.125
do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night

24:39.000 --> 24:43.625
and bring my vengeance to those
who would do them harm?

24:43.708 --> 24:45.583
- That sneaky old vulture.

24:46.875 --> 24:48.916
He was manipulating you from the start.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.750
- Yeah, well, he kept us alive.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.875
- Marc,
he was taking advantage of you.

24:54.625 --> 24:57.833
Or it was just a way for me
to keep being what I've always been.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.083
A killer.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.208
- Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night

25:06.291 --> 25:10.875
and bring my vengeance
to those who would do them harm?

25:13.958 --> 25:14.958
Yes.

25:15.125 --> 25:16.416
Look.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.541
The Scales.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.916
Have we done it? Have we balanced them?

25:24.541 --> 25:26.000
- Then rise.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.666
Rise and live again.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.458
As my fist of vengeance.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.750
As my

25:34.375 --> 25:36.375
Moon Knight.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.833
-Are those...

25:45.250 --> 25:47.250
Come on, Marc. Let's go!

25:49.666 --> 25:50.916
Taweret, what's going on?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.791
- Fear is spreading
in the upper world.

25:52.875 --> 25:56.500
Unbalanced souls are being judged or
condemned to the sands before their time.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.166
Oh, this is bad. This is evil.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.083
-Harrow.
-You see why we have to go back?

26:02.916 --> 26:05.041
- Even if I could
send you back up there,

26:05.125 --> 26:07.583
you'd just be returning to a body
with a bullet in it.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.958
You wouldn't be able to heal.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.958
- Can you send word to Layla?
Please. Help us free Khonshu.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.166
Are you sure
you want to be with Khonshu again?

26:14.250 --> 26:16.458
Seems like you really want
to get away from him.

26:16.541 --> 26:19.750
I did, but this is our only shot.
It's the way it's gotta be.

26:19.875 --> 26:21.500
Please, Taweret, you have to help us.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.083
Please.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.208
What the heck?

26:26.500 --> 26:28.583
Osiris is not going to like this,

26:28.666 --> 26:31.166
but his gate is the only path back.

26:39.541 --> 26:42.916
Get back inside! You don't have long.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.541
Get those Scales balanced.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.666
- There was that bedroom
that you didn't want me to go into.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.875
-That's it. That's where we'll go.
-Just a second.

26:59.958 --> 27:02.541
Just wait a second.
Just give me a second here. Okay?

27:02.666 --> 27:06.500
Um, look, we don't have to
go back through it all again.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.375
We can just talk. Let's just talk.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.375
Right here, right now. I'll tell you...

27:10.458 --> 27:12.041
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

27:12.833 --> 27:15.916
I'm just begging you,
don't make us go there again.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.208
It's not worth it.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.750
Not worth it?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.583
Not worth it?
Marc, you're about to lose everything.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.458
Do you understand?

27:25.083 --> 27:28.375
If we don't get back, and Harrow succeeds,

27:28.458 --> 27:31.208
and all those people die...

27:31.541 --> 27:33.791
If Layla dies,

27:33.875 --> 27:35.458
that's on your head.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.291
It'll be all your fault.

27:37.375 --> 27:40.625
No, no, no! You can't! I won't do it!

27:40.708 --> 27:44.458
I won't do it! You can't make me!
You can't make me!

27:44.541 --> 27:46.625
Marc. Marc. Marc.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.875
Stop it. Stop it.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.750
Did you inject me with something?

28:03.083 --> 28:07.541
You watch too many movies,
all right?

28:07.708 --> 28:10.708
We can't involuntarily sedate patients.

28:10.791 --> 28:14.125
Not these days, huh?
I mean, not unless absolutely necessary.

28:15.791 --> 28:19.958
Oh, Marc, what you've been doing
is so difficult.

28:20.291 --> 28:21.666
I'm so proud of you.

28:22.541 --> 28:26.958
Reliving these kind of
traumatic memories can be so painful.

28:27.041 --> 28:29.375
They look and feel so real,

28:29.458 --> 28:32.541
and you have been at it for hours.

28:33.541 --> 28:34.750
Great work.

28:35.708 --> 28:38.083
It's really... You've been peering inward,

28:38.500 --> 28:42.833
looking deeply into all of the moments
that make you, you.

28:43.666 --> 28:46.125
Here. Come on. Take it.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.250
Yeah. I'm so proud of you, Marc.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.958
Now just stay with me
for one second, okay?

28:53.291 --> 28:55.083
I want you to consider this.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.375
Do you think you created Steven

28:58.208 --> 29:02.458
to hide from all of the awful things
you feel you've done in your life,

29:02.666 --> 29:05.625
or do you think Steven created Marc
to punish the world

29:05.708 --> 29:07.375
for what your mother did to you?

29:10.875 --> 29:11.916
Do you know?

29:13.541 --> 29:14.666
Can you remember?

29:15.750 --> 29:19.458
There's only one way to know.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.958
You're gonna have to open up to Steven.

29:24.416 --> 29:27.291
There can be no progress
without understanding.

29:28.750 --> 29:29.916
Can you do that?

29:31.333 --> 29:33.291
Can you open up to Steven?

29:46.666 --> 29:50.541
I don't... This is my room.

29:51.125 --> 29:53.416
I remember some things,
but I don't remember this.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.916
- It's not Mom. It's not my mom.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.958
It's not my mom.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.416
-It's not my mom.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.208
- Marc, open this door.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.333
Open this door right now.

30:08.416 --> 30:09.666
It's not my mom.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.250
-Open this door.
-It's not my mom.

30:12.875 --> 30:14.333
It's not my mom.

30:19.833 --> 30:22.833
Bloody hell.
Look at the state of this place.

30:23.916 --> 30:26.375
Better sort it out before Mum sees it.

30:28.333 --> 30:31.083
- Marc, open this door right now!

30:38.833 --> 30:43.500
- "When danger is near,
Steven Grant has no fear."

30:47.375 --> 30:48.541
You made me up.

30:49.041 --> 30:51.666
-- Open this door right now!

30:55.875 --> 30:57.416
You're gonna learn

30:59.291 --> 31:00.458
to listen.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.750
Why do you have to make me do this?

31:09.833 --> 31:11.041
I wanna see what she did.

31:11.125 --> 31:12.208
- You disgusting human.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.458
You do not need to see that.

31:14.541 --> 31:15.875
That's the whole point of you.

31:21.291 --> 31:22.875
The point of me?

31:23.541 --> 31:25.708
The point of me?
What? To be your stress ball?

31:26.916 --> 31:28.833
All this time
I thought I was the original,

31:29.833 --> 31:31.583
but I'm just something that you made up.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.375
You've got to live

31:34.416 --> 31:39.375
a happy, simple, normal life.
You understand?

31:39.458 --> 31:41.166
But it was all a lie, wasn't it?

31:41.416 --> 31:42.416
So what?

31:43.166 --> 31:44.291
What does it matter?

31:44.583 --> 31:46.208
What? You wanna remember the truth?

31:46.666 --> 31:49.916
That you had a mother that beats you?
That hated you?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That made your life a living hell?

31:52.083 --> 31:54.125
You're lying.
You're just trying to upset me.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.875
But you've gotten to live
thinking that she loved you.

31:57.208 --> 32:00.250
That she was kind. That she's still alive!

32:03.541 --> 32:04.625
What?

32:05.166 --> 32:06.333
What are you talking about?

32:06.416 --> 32:09.458
She's alive. I speak to her every day.
What are you talking about?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.916
Dad called me after all these years,

32:12.500 --> 32:15.541
about her shiva, and I couldn't do it.

32:15.625 --> 32:19.708
No, this is all wrong.
This is... No, this is all wrong.

32:19.791 --> 32:21.666
-Steven, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, no, no.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.166
No, no, no. No, thank you.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.333
-No. Let me out, let me out!
-Calm down. It's all right. It's okay.

32:27.416 --> 32:29.375
Let me out, let me out!

32:31.208 --> 32:33.958
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

32:34.083 --> 32:36.000
God. I'm so sorry. Sorry...

32:36.375 --> 32:39.500
You gave me a real start there.
Gave you a bit of a wash, didn't I?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.000
Steven?

32:42.750 --> 32:44.625
Hold on a minute. What's this...

32:45.541 --> 32:46.875
It's good to see you again.

32:46.958 --> 32:48.750
What is this? Is this some kind of test?

32:50.166 --> 32:51.666
I recognize this place.

32:51.875 --> 32:52.916
What's this?

32:53.583 --> 32:56.666
-Steven, I'm your doctor. Remember?
-You're my doctor?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.625
-I'm here to help you.
-Dr. Harrow, yeah, is it?

32:59.708 --> 33:01.708
-That's right.
-Oh, yeah, look at that.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.291
Well...

33:03.750 --> 33:05.750
You've really gone up in the world,
haven't you?

33:05.833 --> 33:08.541
I was beginning to worry we might
never speak again.

33:10.875 --> 33:15.250
It's so strange. The little haircut.
Little silly 'tache there.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
It's very Ned Flanders.

33:19.083 --> 33:21.791
-Steven.
-What's Taweret up to now?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.375
It's my fault. I asked Marc
to open up to you.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.458
Did he get a chance to speak with you?

33:28.916 --> 33:30.333
Yeah, well, he...

33:31.500 --> 33:33.166
He lied to me. That's what he did.

33:33.250 --> 33:36.375
Mmm-hmm. And what do you feel
that he lied to you about?

33:37.208 --> 33:38.750
Oh. Nosy.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.875
No, it's just...
Steven, when you first came in here,

33:42.958 --> 33:45.875
I was worried you were never
gonna be able to acknowledge Marc.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.291
What do you mean we're not...

33:48.416 --> 33:49.625
I brought us here?

33:51.625 --> 33:52.958
After your mother passed.

33:53.458 --> 33:55.458
Oi. Don't say that.

33:56.041 --> 33:57.416
That's not true.

33:57.833 --> 33:58.833
That's not true.

33:58.916 --> 34:00.041
Oh, I'm so... I must...

34:00.166 --> 34:02.375
You having a laugh as well?
I don't wanna hear it.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.583
-Steven, I must be mistaken.
-My mother is alive.

34:04.666 --> 34:07.083
You say that again,
I will freak out! I promise.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.500
I must be mistaken. Okay?

34:08.583 --> 34:12.041
Would you like to speak with her?
Why don't we call her?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.750
You don't have her number.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.416
Yeah, we have it on file.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.000
-Hold on, let me just get Dylan.
-No, don't do that.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.166
It'll take two seconds.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.541
Don't bother her.

34:20.625 --> 34:23.708
Hey, Dylan. Yeah.
Could you call Mrs. Grant, please?

34:23.791 --> 34:25.541
She screens her calls. She won't answer.

34:25.625 --> 34:28.333
-She's afraid of tele salespeople.
-She'll wanna talk to you.

34:28.416 --> 34:30.750
I'm sure of it. She's getting the number.

34:30.833 --> 34:31.875
Don't do that.

34:31.958 --> 34:33.833
Okay, okay. Thank you.

34:33.916 --> 34:35.583
-Please don't do that.
-It's ringing.

34:35.666 --> 34:37.083
Don't bother her, please.

34:37.166 --> 34:41.000
Uh, hello, Mrs. Grant.
Yes, this is Dr. Harrow.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.250
Mmm-hmm.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.125
Steven's here.
He'd like to speak with you.

34:46.166 --> 34:49.375
Steven, would you like to speak
to your mum?

34:59.791 --> 35:01.000
My mum...

35:04.833 --> 35:05.916
My mum is dead.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.000
My mum is dead.

35:59.041 --> 36:00.500
- No, no. Not gonna do it.

36:01.666 --> 36:03.708
I'm not giving you that satisfaction.

36:31.583 --> 36:32.666
I'm so sorry.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.750
I'm so sorry.

37:01.833 --> 37:02.833
What...

37:03.666 --> 37:04.875
Where am I?

37:08.375 --> 37:09.583
Bloody hell, what...

37:12.291 --> 37:14.458
Oh, bollocks.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.375
Not again.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.125
Heya, Mum. Hey, you all right?

37:19.291 --> 37:20.291
Yeah, um...

37:20.708 --> 37:25.250
Would you believe it?
I am totally lost again.

37:25.333 --> 37:28.000
I don't know where I am.
What an absolute muppet!

37:28.541 --> 37:31.166
No, I know I did it again,
but I don't know.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.708
I'm looking down a street...

37:33.833 --> 37:36.291
Kinda looks a bit like Mayfair. I think...

37:36.375 --> 37:38.583
Oh, they're driving
on the wrong side. Sorry.

37:38.666 --> 37:41.458
- This is it. Mom's death
and shiva two months ago.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.916
This was the moment our lives
started bleeding into each other.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.750
Milwaukee... Milwaukee Avenue?
Does that sound familiar?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.250
I couldn't...

37:50.208 --> 37:52.583
I just couldn't...
I couldn't face that again.

37:54.541 --> 37:56.041
All the things I'd done...

37:56.125 --> 37:57.291
Marc,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.041
all those horrible things
that she said to you,

38:01.125 --> 38:03.208
she was wrong. It wasn't your fault.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.958
I shouldn't have brought him in the cave.

38:08.125 --> 38:09.125
Hey.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.416
Hey. You were just a child.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.000
It wasn't your fault.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.916
Hey, do you feel that?

38:29.541 --> 38:31.166
I think we just stopped.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.166
The Gates.

38:34.125 --> 38:36.916
The Gates of Osiris. Come on. Hurry.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.625
Taweret, what's happening?

38:41.708 --> 38:44.583
- I've never seen the gates
to the world above so close.

38:44.833 --> 38:45.875
- How do we open them?

38:45.958 --> 38:48.250
I'm so sorry. Your Scales never balanced.

38:48.333 --> 38:52.000
Our journey's come to an end.
I cannot stop the inevitable.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.041
I was really rooting for you guys,

38:54.125 --> 38:57.916
but the unbalanced souls of the Duat
now must claim yours.

39:21.541 --> 39:23.541
Marc, they don't look very friendly.

39:23.666 --> 39:25.125
Hide. Hide.

39:27.375 --> 39:30.416
Gabon. New York, Dubai.

39:32.416 --> 39:33.875
- Watch out!

39:42.583 --> 39:43.625
Oh, no!

39:45.333 --> 39:46.666
Taweret!

39:50.833 --> 39:51.875
No!

40:10.416 --> 40:11.666
Oh, God.

40:15.458 --> 40:18.458
Marc, you've got this.

40:19.958 --> 40:21.083
But if I'm you...

40:23.166 --> 40:24.625
It means I've got this, too.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.375
Six!

40:37.416 --> 40:38.958
I prefer cricket.

40:55.708 --> 40:56.708
Ow!

41:00.958 --> 41:02.500
No! No!

41:03.583 --> 41:05.583
Marc! Marc, no!

41:12.000 --> 41:13.583
Steven!

41:13.666 --> 41:14.875
Steven!

41:16.875 --> 41:18.291
Steven!

41:22.625 --> 41:23.833
Steven!

41:24.625 --> 41:27.208
No, wait. Wait. Wait!

41:27.791 --> 41:29.958
-Wait!
-Steven! Run!

41:30.166 --> 41:31.416
-Wait!
-Wait, he's coming!

41:31.708 --> 41:33.625
Keep... Stop the boat. Stop the boat!

41:33.750 --> 41:36.125
- Wait! Wait!

41:38.833 --> 41:39.875
Oh, God.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.375
-Steven!
-Wait...

41:43.375 --> 41:46.125
No, no, no! Steven!

42:00.458 --> 42:02.708
Stop the boat! Stop the boat!

42:05.625 --> 42:08.708
Your Scales are balanced.
