WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:05.405
HMM. HOW WAS HOT YOGA?

00:05.472 --> 00:07.474
INTERESTING. I LEARNED
THE TEMPERATURE

00:07.541 --> 00:10.744
AT WHICH DEODORANT
BECOMES ODORANT.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.516
THEN WHY DO YOU LOOK
AND SMELL SO DAISY FRESH?

00:15.582 --> 00:18.051
THAT'S BECAUSE AFTER
YOGA CLASS, I WENT HOME,
TOOK A SHOWER,

00:18.118 --> 00:20.220
CHANGED INTO SOME
CLEAN YOGA CLOTHES,

00:20.287 --> 00:22.289
GRABBED MY MAT
AND CAME HERE.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.394
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
- IT MAKES<i>PERFECT</i>SENSE.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.563
I AM TELLING THE WORLD
I'M A GIRL WHO DOES YOGA

00:29.630 --> 00:32.432
WITHOUT BEING
ALL SWEATY

00:32.499 --> 00:34.434
LIKE A GIRL
WHO DOES YOGA,

00:34.501 --> 00:38.405
OR LIKE YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:38.472 --> 00:42.276
BUFFALO SAUCE
BRINGS OUT MY NATURAL OILS.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.211
DIG IN. IT'S ON ME.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.047
OH, IT IS ON YOU.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.716
IT'S ALL OVER YOU.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.152
HMM,
LARGE PLATE OF WINGS,

00:52.219 --> 00:55.355
LARGE BEVERAGE.
YOU WIN THE LOTTERY?

00:55.422 --> 00:59.259
YOU KNOW THAT AD
I PUT ON CRAIGSLIST
FOR AT-HOME TUTORING?

00:59.326 --> 01:02.563
- YOU GOT A HIT?
- TWO.

01:02.629 --> 01:05.432
THE PARENTS
OF A HIGH SCHOOL KID
WHO NEEDS HELP IN MATH

01:05.499 --> 01:09.269
AND AN OLD MAN WHO WANTED
ME TO STOMP ON BIRTHDAY
BALLOONS IN HEELS.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.506
AND KNOWING YOU,
YOU WENT WITH THE KID.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.509
THAT OLD MAN, HE'D HAVE
BOUGHT YOU A CAR.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.179
JO, DON'T LOOK NOW.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.448
THAT HOT GUY
FROM LAST WEEK IS HERE.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.318
HE'S BACK,
AND HE'S CHECKING US OUT.

01:25.485 --> 01:28.088
AND HE CAUGHT ME.

01:28.155 --> 01:31.491
JO, YOU KNOW A WINGMAN
ISN'T SOMEONE JUST SITTING
AROUND EATING WINGS, RIGHT?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.662
WELL, IT'S WORKING
BECAUSE HERE HE COMES.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.766
GOOD EVENING, LADIES.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.069
SAW YOU FROM OVER THERE,
AND I WANTED TO COME
TALK TO YOU,

01:42.135 --> 01:44.905
BUT I DIDN'T WANNA USE
SOME CHEESY PICKUP LINE.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.608
( SNEEZES )
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.676
I MUST BE ALLERGIC
TO YOUR GOOD LOOKS.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.047
OKAY, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY
MEDICALLY POSSIBLE.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.384
OH! I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.952
AS YOU WERE.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.423
HE WAS TRYING TO COME UP
WITH A NON-CHEESY WAY
TO TALK TO ME,

02:03.490 --> 02:06.760
BUT HE'S STILL
NOT QUITE THERE YET.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.129
I'M BRIAN ANDERSON.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.565
NICE START.
I'M GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN

02:11.632 --> 02:13.767
AND THAT IS JO PYE.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.802
HOWDY.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.304
I SEE YOU DO YOGA.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.773
YES, I JUST GOT OUT
OF CLASS.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.476
I MUST BE
ALL GLOWY.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.044
SUPER EMBARRASSING.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.914
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.250
YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE
A LITTLE YOGA MYSELF.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.252
THIS IS A LITTLE MOVE
I LIKE TO CALL

02:32.319 --> 02:34.588
"TAKING YOUR PHONE
AND PUTTING IN MY NUMBER."

02:34.655 --> 02:36.490
( LAUGHS )

02:36.557 --> 02:38.025
AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO DO A LITTLE MOVE

02:38.091 --> 02:41.595
I CALL
"UNLOCK YOUR PHONE."

02:41.662 --> 02:43.864
- THIS IS PROBABLY WHY
YOU LOCK YOUR PHONE.
- MM-HMM.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.933
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY I SHOULD UNLOCK MY PHONE.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.467
SO I CAN TAKE YOU
TO DINNER.

02:47.534 --> 02:50.204
AM I ORDERING FROM A WAITER
OR FROM A CLOWN'S MOUTH?

02:52.472 --> 02:55.509
- PAPER MENU,
CLOTH NAPKINS.
- START TYPING.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.513
- HOW'S SATURDAY NIGHT?
- WE'RE GONNA ORDER IN,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.248
CATCH UP ON SOME
"COUGAR TOWNS."

03:02.449 --> 03:04.218
AS YOU WERE.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.387
SATURDAY SOUNDS
PERFECT.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.389
NICE MEETING YOU,
BRIAN ANDERSON.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.526
IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU, GEORGIA, AND JO.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.161
SEE YA.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.431
HOW DOES THAT ALWAYS
HAPPEN FOR YOU?

03:17.497 --> 03:20.000
SWEETHEART, YOU CAN'T
ASK ME THESE QUESTIONS

03:20.067 --> 03:22.769
WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING
RANCH DRESSING.
YOU JUST CAN'T.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.873
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

03:38.385 --> 03:40.020
- ( CLICKS )
- ( SPEAKS SOFTLY )

03:40.087 --> 03:42.189
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING?

03:42.256 --> 03:44.091
I'M TAKING NEW PICTURES
FOR MY FACEBOOK PAGE.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.759
MY NEW FRIEND BRIAN IS
GONNA BE LOOKING ME UP,

03:45.826 --> 03:47.261
AND I WANT HIM TO SEE
WHAT I LOOK LIKE

03:47.327 --> 03:50.797
WHEN I'M JUST CHILLAXING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.134
THAT'S YOU,
SALT OF THE EARTH.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.436
AUNT HONEY,
CAN WE TAKE PICTURES

03:56.503 --> 03:58.605
ON YOUR FANCY
COUCH UPSTAIRS?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.440
YOU KNOW THERE'S
NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY

04:00.507 --> 04:03.310
IN MY APARTMENT.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.013
HOW DO YOU KNOW BRIAN

04:06.079 --> 04:09.283
IS GOING TO CHECK YOU OUT
ON THIS DEVIL MACHINE?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.886
BECAUSE, AUNT HONEY,
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.222
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU MEET
YOU FACEBOOK HIM. HIM.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.559
YOU SEE IF THEY TWEET
GONNA GET TO KNOW SOMEONE?

04:18.625 --> 04:22.129
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
WE GOT TO KNOW PEOPLE BY--

04:22.196 --> 04:25.365
AND I KNOW THIS IS
GOING TO SOUND CRAZY--

04:25.432 --> 04:27.601
ACTUALLY GETTING
TO KNOW THEM.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.469
( MOCK LAUGHTER )

04:29.536 --> 04:31.939
WELL, LIKE, WHEN YOU
BLOWING SMOKE SIGNALS YOU

04:32.005 --> 04:34.141
FROM ONE CAVE
TO ANOTHER?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.944
HONEY, DON'T MAKE ME
PUT MY GLASS DOWN.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.645
I'M SORRY.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.848
WELL, THANKS TO MY FRIEND
THE DEVIL MACHINE,

04:40.914 --> 04:43.750
I CAN WEED OUT ALL
OF THE LOSERS, FREAKS

04:43.817 --> 04:46.053
AND COMIC BOOK NERDS.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.155
THOSE GET TOSSED
IN THE JO PILE.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.326
WELL, CALL ME
OLD-FASHIONED,

04:52.392 --> 04:54.695
BUT WHEN YOU ARE GETTING
TO KNOW A GENTLEMAN,

04:54.761 --> 04:57.898
YOU SHOULD DO IT
FACE TO FACE.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.067
AT LEAST UNTIL
YOU SWITCH POSITIONS.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.105
I'M TALKING
ABOUT DANCING.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.541
YOU GIRLS ARE FILTHY!

05:09.676 --> 05:12.012
AUNT HONEY, I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT IS OLD-FASHIONED.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.615
WE HAVE A NEW WAY
OF DATING THESE DAYS
AND IT'S MUCH EASIER.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.317
AND FOR THE RECORD,
YOU WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT DANCING.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.587
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.757
THERE ARE
427 BRIAN ANDERSONS
IN NEW YORK CITY.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.527
NO NO NO NO,
I NEED A HARD TARGET.

05:26.593 --> 05:29.196
MY SATURDAY NIGHTS
ARE PRECIOUS TO ME.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.899
HOW AM I GONNA FIND OUT
MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS GUY

05:31.965 --> 05:35.369
BEFORE I COMMIT
TO A WHOLE DINNER
WITH HIM?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.671
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GRAB A QUICK COFFEE?

05:37.738 --> 05:41.208
I LIKE IT--
IN AND OUT,
LIMITED EXPOSURE.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.677
PUT YOUR PHONE ON THE TABLE,
ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.080
YOU LISTEN IN,
GOOGLE HIM UNTIL WE FIND OUT
THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.918
OR YOU COULD HAVE
A NICE DINNER WITH THE MAN

05:50.984 --> 05:53.320
AND HAVE
A REAL CONVERSATION.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.558
OKAY, IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA HELP,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.826
I'MA NEED YOU
TO STOP DISTRACTING ME.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.763
NICE JOB, MIKEY.
NEXT TIME LET'S WORK
ON THOSE EQUATIONS

06:02.829 --> 06:05.599
AND SEE HOW YOU DO
WITH THE FACTORIZATION
OF POLYNOMIALS.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.001
WHOA, YOU HAVE
"IRON CURTAIN OPS 3"?

06:08.068 --> 06:10.103
HAVE YOU MADE IT
TO THE SECRET ROOM
IN THE KREMLIN?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.439
- THERE'S A SECRET ROOM?
- LITTLE HINT--

06:12.506 --> 06:15.342
KNOCK THREE TIMES
ON THE HANDICAPPED STALL.

06:15.409 --> 06:19.379
THERE'S A HANDICAPPED STALL?
( LAUGHS )

06:19.446 --> 06:23.750
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
ALL NIGHT-- HANGING OUT
IN DIGITAL BATHROOMS.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.420
YOU'RE FUNNY, JO.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.388
SEE YOU THURSDAY.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.890
( GIGGLES )

06:29.957 --> 06:31.458
HI, AUNT HONEY.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.494
WHAT?

06:35.495 --> 06:37.364
YOU DON'T SEE IT.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.233
SEE WHAT?

06:39.299 --> 06:41.568
THAT YOUNG MAN IS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.505
( LAUGHS )
MIKEY? NO.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.474
JO, YOU SPEND SO MUCH
TIME IN CYBERWORLD,

06:47.541 --> 06:51.178
YOU HAVE COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR ABILITY
TO READ PEOPLE.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.679
I DON'T NEED
TO READ PEOPLE.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.516
I CAN READ FACEBOOK.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.818
SEE, LOOK, IT SAYS
THAT MIKEY LIKES PIZZA,

06:57.885 --> 07:01.154
THAT HIS FAVORITE MOVIES
ARE "THE FAST AND THE FURY-I."

07:02.556 --> 07:03.957
THE COMPUTER TELLS ME
EVERYTHING,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.959
AND THE ONLY THING
IT'S SAYING HE LOVES IS

07:06.026 --> 07:07.961
DRESSING IN DRAG.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.432
OH, NO, THAT'S HIS SISTER.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.935
WOW, THOSE ARE
SOME STRONG GENES.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.770
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.039
I AM NEVER WRONG
ABOUT ANYONE,

07:19.106 --> 07:22.276
EXCEPT FOR RICKY MARTIN.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.411
DIDN'T SEE
THAT ONE COMING.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.753
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR GETTING COFFEE
WITH ME.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.421
SATURDAY JUST FELT
SO FAR AWAY.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.590
I WAS HAPPY
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.392
GOOD.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.893
SO HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.095
ALSO, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.630
OH, AND WHERE WERE
YOU BORN AT?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.767
FINE, IMPORT/EXPORT

BEN FRANKLIN,
CREAM CHEESE.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.946
CAN YOU GET ME
ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.647
YOU HAVEN'T
TOUCHED YOURS.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.283
WELL, I DON'T FEEL IT
UNTIL THE SECOND ONE.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.924
AND A GLASS
OF ICE, PLEASE.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.428
( SPUTTERS )

08:14.494 --> 08:16.463

08:16.530 --> 08:19.700

K.G.B. MOLES.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.635
<i>( GUNFIRE )</i>

08:21.702 --> 08:23.770

SPY GAME, JO.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.006
HOW ARE WE DOING
WITH THE BRIAN ANDERSONS?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.008
WITH WHAT HE SAID SO FAR,
I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN

08:28.075 --> 08:30.777
TO 31 POSSIBLE GUYS,
BUT I NEED MORE SPECIFICS.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.613
ASK HIM
IF HE WAS BURIED

08:32.679 --> 08:35.349
IN ARLINGTON
NATIONAL CEMETERY.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.351
REALLY, JO? REALLY?

08:37.417 --> 08:39.620
HE'S COMING BACK.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.055
SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU LIVED IN NEW YORK?

08:42.122 --> 08:45.192
TWO MONTHS.
I CAME HERE RIGHT
AFTER COLLEGE.

08:45.259 --> 08:48.362
- WHERE DID YOU GO?
- GEORGETOWN.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.797
AND I SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.633
YOU DO?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.968
YEAH, I'M NERVOUS TOO.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.136
HUH?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.638
SINCE I MET YOU YESTERDAY,

08:57.704 --> 09:01.108
I HAVE BEEN SPINNING OUT,
WONDERING WHO YOU ARE,

09:01.175 --> 09:02.643
WHAT YOU LIKE.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.611
BUT SITTING HERE
WITH YOU NOW,

09:04.678 --> 09:07.614
ALL I CAN THINK
IS "SLOW DOWN."

09:07.681 --> 09:09.616
I WANNA GET
TO KNOW YOU, GEORGIA,

09:09.683 --> 09:12.920
AND THE LONGER
IT TAKES, THE BETTER.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.822
DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW
EXACTLY THE RIGHT 
THING TO SAY?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.759
JO:
<i>DIE, COMMIE SCUM! DIE!</i>

09:19.993 --> 09:23.330
THAT WAS MY RINGTONE.
I AM SUPER PATRIOTIC.

U.S.A., U.S.A.!

09:27.301 --> 09:30.103
I GOTTA TAKE THIS, OKAY?
HELLO, JO.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.839
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.274
NONE OF THE BRIAN ANDERSONS
I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO

09:34.341 --> 09:36.810
GRADUATED FROM GEORGETOWN.
IT'S LIKE HE DOESN'T EXIST.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.812
MAYBE HE'S
AN UNDERCOVER COP--

09:38.879 --> 09:41.148
OOH, OR IN
WITNESS PROTECTION.

09:41.215 --> 09:45.052
OH MY GOD.
I BET HE'S A<i>SPY.</i>

09:46.320 --> 09:49.423
JO, SERIOUSLY,
HE IS NOT A SPY.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.425
YOU ONLY THINK THAT
'CAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING
THAT STUPID SPY GAME.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.093
IF YOU WERE PLAYING
"DWARF QUEST 4,"

09:53.160 --> 09:55.295
YOU'D BE TELLING ME
BRIAN WAS A WIZARD.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.266
NO, THEN HE'D BE
A SMALL WARLOCK.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.837
THINK ABOUT IT--
IMPORT/EXPORT.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.506
CLASSIC C.I.A. COVER.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.774
I MEAN HE'S DOING EVERYTHING
BUT SPEAKING RUSSIAN.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.811
JO, THAT'S<i>CRAZY,</i>
ALL RIGHT?

10:10.878 --> 10:13.981
GOODNESS.
STAY ON THE LINE,
OKAY? I'M GOING IN.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.117
( SPEAKING RUSSIAN )

10:21.889 --> 10:23.490
WAS THAT RUSSIAN?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.760
- YEAH. WORK THING.
- AH.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.428
- OH.
- LOOK, I'M SORRY,

10:28.495 --> 10:30.097
BUT I'M REALLY
GONNA HAVE TO GO.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.734
I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I CAN.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.868
SOMEHOW.

10:40.174 --> 10:42.643
OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD.

10:42.709 --> 10:46.213
OH MY GOD! WE KNOW
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.893
WHOEVER THIS GUY IS,
HE HAS COVERED HIS TRACKS

10:59.960 --> 11:03.597
- OR THE GOVERNMENT HAS
COVERED THEM FOR HIM.
- GEORGIA:<i>JO.</i>

11:03.664 --> 11:06.266
HE IS NOT A SPY, JO.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.801
ACTUALLY, THAT WOULD
BE KIND OF COOL.

11:07.868 --> 11:11.638
IT'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS
AS YOU THINK.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.173
AND THAT'S ALL
I CAN TELL YOU.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.175
IT'S AN ACTIVE OPERATION.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.014
ALL I KNOW IS THAT BRIAN
STILL WANTS TO HAVE DINNER
WITH ME TOMORROW,

11:21.081 --> 11:23.817
AND I REALLY LIKE HIM.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.221
I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT A GUY OUR AGE

11:27.287 --> 11:29.256
THAT DOESN'T EXIST ONLINE.

11:30.724 --> 11:34.461
WHAT'S STRANGE IS A GIRL
WHO CAN'T READ PEOPLE

11:34.528 --> 11:36.597
TRYING TO TALK HER FRIEND
OUT OF A NICE DATE

11:36.663 --> 11:40.167
JUST BECAUSE
THE BOY HASN'T PASSED
SOME CRAZY BACKGROUND CHECK.

11:40.234 --> 11:42.503
IT WASN'T<i>CRAZY.</i>

11:42.569 --> 11:44.838
AND WHAT'S THE POINT IN
GIVING YOU THE BABY POWDER

11:44.905 --> 11:47.207
AND THE TAPE IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET ME A FINGERPRINT?

11:47.274 --> 11:50.043
OH, MY GOD, JO,
YOU ACTUALLY DID IT.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.713
YOU MADE AUNT HONEY SEEM
LIKE THE SANE ONE.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.981
<i>( CHUCKLES )</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:56.383
I AM GOING ON THAT DINNER
WITH BRIAN,

11:56.450 --> 12:00.387
AND I AM GOING
TO GET TO KNOW HIM 
WHILE I'M WITH HIM.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.089
THROWBACK.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.825
GOOD FOR YOU, GEORGIA.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.928
AND IF THIS BRIAN
SHOULD EVER TAKE 
YOU TO MOROCCO,

12:07.995 --> 12:11.131
YOU AND I HAVE
NEVER MET.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.175
GOOD. MOVING ONTO
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.012
IF A GUY WANTED
TO BUY YOU PERFUME,
WHAT KIND WOULD YOU LIKE?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.881
WELL, I'M ALLERGIC,

12:27.948 --> 12:30.751
SO IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE WATER-BASED.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.319
OH BOY.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.889
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN WE JUST FOCUS
ON YOUR HOMEWORK?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.391
SURE.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.427
SO DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS--

12:42.429 --> 12:45.098
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- WHERE'D YOU GET
YOUR T-SHIRT?

12:45.165 --> 12:48.268
ONLINE. I THINK
I BOUGHT IT ONLINE
ON AN ONLINE STORE.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.271
OH, LOOK.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.273
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A WATCH.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.075
I HAVE A BIOLOGICAL CLOCK--
AN INTERNAL CLOCK.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.946
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.
OFF YOU GO.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.482
UH, OKAY. CAN I SEE YOU
ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.117
SATURDAY NIGHT?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.421
YEAH, FOR EXTRA TUTORING.
I HAVE A<i>HUGE</i>TEST
ON MONDAY.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.324
IT'S HALF OUR GRADE.
I REALLY NEED THE HELP.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.693
OKAY, FINE.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.996
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
SATURDAY'S THE DAY
I WAX MY MUSTACHE.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.434
WOW, SMART AND FUNNY.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.405
- SAY IT.
- OH...

13:25.472 --> 13:27.307
YOU WERE RIGHT.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.343
MIKEY'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.913
THAT'S ALL
I NEEDED TO HEAR.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.315
SAY IT AGAIN.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.190
( LAUGHS )

13:43.257 --> 13:45.926
I COULD LISTEN TO YOU TALK
ABOUT YOURSELF ALL NIGHT.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.196
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.932
AND I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

13:51.999 --> 13:53.867
FOR ACTING A LITTLE WEIRD
THE OTHER DAY.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.602
YEAH, WHAT WAS
THAT ABOUT?

13:55.669 --> 13:58.338
I WASN'T SURE IF WE WERE
ON A DATE OR IF I WAS
BEING AUDITED.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.342
BY THE WAY,
YOU STILL NEED
THAT CREDIT REPORT?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.213
NO, I HAVE TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.948
I WAS ASKING
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS

14:08.015 --> 14:10.851
SO THAT I COULD
LOOK YOU UP ONLINE.
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE DO THAT.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.487
- SO DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING?
-<i>NO.</i>

14:13.554 --> 14:16.023
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU
IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.458
I MEAN EVERYONE HAS
SOMETHING ONLINE.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.627
WELL, THERE'S
A REASON I DON'T.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.996
I'M<i>NOT</i>
WHO YOU THINK I AM.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.101
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:28.168 --> 14:29.970
HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS?

14:31.071 --> 14:34.141
THERE WAS THIS... MOLE

14:34.208 --> 14:36.376
AND IT HAD
TO BE TAKEN OUT.

14:38.579 --> 14:40.013
THERE WAS A MOLE?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.616
IT WAS UGLY.
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:42.683 --> 14:46.386
( STAMMERS )
WHAT KIND OF MOLE WAS IT?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.388
( WHISPERING )
WAS IT K.G.B.?

14:49.590 --> 14:51.225
NORTH KOREA?

14:51.291 --> 14:54.194
WHAT? NO.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.597
THERE WAS
A HUGE MOLE
ON MY FACE.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.498
I HAD IT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.434
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS TALKING ABOUT?

15:00.501 --> 15:02.769
( LAUGHING )
THAT.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.439
YOU KNOW?

15:05.506 --> 15:07.508
NOT LIKE A SPY.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.943
THAT'S JUST STUPID.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.680
KIDS USED
TO CALL ME MOLE BOY,
SO I HAD IT REMOVED.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.217
AND EVERYTHING WAS
GOING FINE UNTIL PEOPLE
FOUND OUT THAT THE DOCTORS

15:17.284 --> 15:19.686
HAD TAKEN SKIN
FROM MY...

15:21.889 --> 15:26.460
BUTT AND GRAFTED IT OVER
WHERE THE MOLE HAD BEEN,

15:26.527 --> 15:28.929
THEN EVERYONE
STARTED CALLING ME--

15:28.996 --> 15:31.098
ASSFACE.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.267
HOW'D YOU GUESS?

15:33.333 --> 15:36.270
THERE'S REALLY NOWHERE ELSE
YOU CAN GO WITH THAT.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.939
WHEN I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,
I WANTED A FRESH START,

15:39.006 --> 15:42.409
SO I STARTED GOING
BY MY MIDDLE NAME-- BRIAN.

15:42.476 --> 15:44.611
THAT'S WHY YOU
CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
ABOUT ME ONLINE.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.113
GOT IT.
( CHUCKLING )

15:46.180 --> 15:49.216
SO THERE'S
NO REAL MYSTERY.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.919
YOU'RE JUST A NORMAL GUY

15:51.985 --> 15:53.820
WITH AN ASSFACE.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.507
BRIAN IS AN ASSFACE.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.111
AND THIS IS
WHY WE PRESCREEN.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.147
IF GEORGIA HAD FOUND
HIS FACEBOOK PAGE

16:20.214 --> 16:21.648
AND READ EVEN ONE

16:21.715 --> 16:24.751
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
ASSFACE,"

16:24.818 --> 16:27.087
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS PROBLEM.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.390
YOU MEAN YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GONE OUT WITH
A NICE YOUNG MAN?

16:30.457 --> 16:33.026
A NICE YOUNG MAN
WHO TRIED TO FOOL ME.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.997
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I REMEMBER HIM TAKING
PHOTOS OF HIMSELF

16:37.064 --> 16:40.868
IN A BALL GOWN,
PUTTING THEM ON
THAT FANCY ABACUS

16:40.934 --> 16:44.304
AND TELLING THE WORLD THAT
THAT'S HOW HE CHILLS
AROUND THE HOUSE.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.007
NO, WAIT.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.476
THAT WAS YOU!

16:49.543 --> 16:52.446
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
- WAS IT?

16:52.513 --> 16:55.382
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT THE BEST VERSION
OF HIMSELF OUT THERE,

16:55.449 --> 16:57.417
SAME AS YOU,
SAME AS--

16:57.484 --> 17:00.387
SAME AS MOST PEOPLE.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.457
I'M A GOOD VERSION OF ME.

17:03.524 --> 17:04.925
I KNOW, BABY.

17:04.992 --> 17:06.827
LOOK.

17:06.894 --> 17:09.630
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE,

17:09.696 --> 17:12.299
YOU SHOULD LET THEM
SEE YOUR WORST.

17:12.366 --> 17:16.136
THAT'S WHAT BRIAN DID,
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH IT.

17:16.203 --> 17:20.140
BRIAN IS A GREAT GUY.
HE MAKES ME LAUGH

17:20.207 --> 17:23.477
AND HE LETS ME TALK
ABOUT MYSELF...

17:23.544 --> 17:25.145
A LOT.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.814
THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU TOLD HIM SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF,

17:27.881 --> 17:30.551
SOMETHING THAT YOU
WOULDN'T DARE PUT

17:30.617 --> 17:32.619
ON THIS
SINGLE-PROCESSOR P.C.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.821
WITH HALF THE RAM
IT SHOULD HAVE.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.958
I'M NOT AN IDIOT, GIRLS.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.536
- HEY, JO.
- OH CRAP.

17:50.537 --> 17:54.474
LISTEN, MIKEY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.976
EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:56.043 --> 17:58.378
I THINK SO.
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE THIS BEFORE.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.714
( CLEARS THROAT )

18:00.781 --> 18:02.883
LOOK, YOU'RE A REALLY
SWEET GUY,

18:02.950 --> 18:05.385
BUT I SEE YOU
AS MORE OF A FRIEND.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.088
OH MY GOD.
YOU THINK I LIKE YOU?

18:08.155 --> 18:11.158
I MEAN YOU THINK
I LIKE YOU LIKE YOU?

18:11.225 --> 18:13.160
YOU DON'T?

18:13.227 --> 18:16.063
EWW. THAT'S CREEPY.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.465
YOU'RE OLD.
AREN'T YOU LIKE 25?

18:18.532 --> 18:21.502
SO-- SO WHAT'S
WITH THE FLOWERS?

18:21.568 --> 18:25.672
OH, THEY'RE FOR
MY AGE-APPROPRIATE
GIRLFRIEND.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.141
THAT'S WHY I ASKED
ABOUT YOUR T-SHIRT
AND YOUR PERFUME.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.310
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.
WE'RE GOING OUT
AFTER THIS.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.312
MY FIRST BREAKUP

18:32.379 --> 18:34.481
AND I STILL GOT DUMPED.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.484
SO WHAT'S
YOUR GIRLFRIEND LIKE?

18:37.551 --> 18:41.154
SHE'S AWESOME.
HERE, LET ME SHOW
YOU HER ON FACEBOOK.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.823
JUST GOTTA GIVE IT
A SECOND TO LOAD.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.025
- YEAH, YOU NEED MORE RAM.
- I KNOW.

18:45.092 --> 18:48.128
WHO'S BRIAN THE SPY?

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
IT'S THIS GUY
I WAS TRYING TO LOOK UP.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.132
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND HIM.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.134
- YOU HAVE ENOUGH HERE.
- NO, I DON'T.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.970
TRUST ME. I HAVE
A GENIUS I.Q. AND I TAUGHT
AT COMPUTER CAMP.

18:57.037 --> 18:59.139
FOUND HIM.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.341
- HIS FIRST NAME IS ERIC.
- WHAT?

19:01.408 --> 19:04.978
WE'VE ALL TAUGHT
AT COMPUTER CAMP.

19:05.045 --> 19:08.815
( PANTING ) HEY.
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
WAITING LONG.

19:08.882 --> 19:12.686
NO, I'M JUST GLAD YOU ESCAPED
WHATEVER WAS CHASING YOU.

19:12.753 --> 19:16.423
OH, NO, I JUST GOT OUT
OF YOGA CLASS

19:16.490 --> 19:18.392
AND I WANTED YOU

19:18.458 --> 19:20.928
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.596
IT'S A GIFT.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.967
AND I DIDN'T
GET YOU ANYTHING.

19:27.034 --> 19:30.037
NO, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR WHOLE
FACE SITUATION

19:30.103 --> 19:32.806
AND HOW BRAVE IT WAS FOR YOU
TO SHARE THAT WITH ME,

19:32.873 --> 19:34.808
SO HERE I AM.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.377
IT'S THE REAL ME,
BUT ONLY FIVE MINUTES A DAY,

19:37.444 --> 19:39.112
TOPS. I SWEAR.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.982
- I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANK YOU.

19:42.049 --> 19:44.685
NOW LET'S HAVE SOME DRINKS
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.587
( KISSES ) UH!

19:46.653 --> 19:49.590
- YEAH, THANK GOD
IT TASTES LIKE FACE.
- ( LAUGHS )

19:49.656 --> 19:52.192
GEORGIA, WAIT!

19:52.259 --> 19:54.328
HIS NAME IS ERIC ANDERSON.
HE'S FROM PHILLY,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.063
HE HAS THREE SISTERS
AND HE LOVES CHEESESTEAKS.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.965
OH, AND ONE MORE THING--

19:58.031 --> 19:59.766
HE'S<i>MARRIED.</i>

20:01.535 --> 20:02.903
YOU'RE WHAT?

20:02.970 --> 20:05.172
NO, I'M NOT.

20:05.239 --> 20:08.809
TELL THAT TO NADIA,
YOUR RUSSIAN WIFE.

20:08.876 --> 20:11.612
THAT'S WHO HE WAS
TALKING TO ON THE PHONE.
WE HAVE NAMES, DOCUMENTS,

20:11.678 --> 20:15.249
GOOGLE IMAGES.
I WOULD SHOW YOU,
BUT IT'S NOT PRETTY.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.184
ACTUALLY, HIS WIFE
IS SUPER PRETTY.

20:18.752 --> 20:20.120
IS ALL THIS TRUE?

20:21.288 --> 20:23.056
OKAY, YES,
BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.

20:23.123 --> 20:24.358
OH, REALLY?

20:24.424 --> 20:26.059
I'M A SPY?

20:26.126 --> 20:29.897
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I SPANK YOU
ON YOUR FACE!

20:37.371 --> 20:39.439
WOW, THAT WAS ROUGH.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.941
HEY, I'M MICHAEL.

20:41.008 --> 20:44.011
AND THIS IS ALL FACE.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.488
HOW YOU DOING?

20:54.555 --> 20:58.425
ICE CREAM HAS PUSHED
MOST OF THE RAGE OUT
OF MY BODY

20:58.492 --> 21:00.594
AND MOST OF THE YOGA.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.631
YOU KNOW THAT
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

21:04.698 --> 21:08.135
I KNOW, AND IN A WAY 
I'M KIND OF GLAD THAT
IT HAPPENED.

21:08.202 --> 21:11.171
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO OPEN
MYSELF UP TO A GUY.

21:11.238 --> 21:13.373
IT WAS
THE WRONG GUY, BUT...

21:15.342 --> 21:17.477
BEING REAL
WITH SOMEONE FELT RIGHT.

21:17.544 --> 21:20.214
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
FEEL EVEN BETTER?

21:20.280 --> 21:23.817
CHANGING BRIAN'S
FACEBOOK STATUS 
TO "TWO-TIMING ASSFACE."

21:25.752 --> 21:27.821
MIKEY TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DO IT.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.792
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>
