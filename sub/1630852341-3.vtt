WEBVTT

00:12.666 --> 00:14.666
[wind howling]

00:18.125 --> 00:19.791
[breathing heavily]

00:30.875 --> 00:32.333
[grunting]

00:33.166 --> 00:34.000
[growls]

00:42.541 --> 00:43.375
[Ciri] Again.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.708
[grunting]

00:51.125 --> 00:52.500
[yells] Shit!

00:52.583 --> 00:55.250
That's enough. We'll start fresh tomorrow.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.458
I can do it.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.166
[growls]

01:04.541 --> 01:06.083
You need rest.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.500
Anything else
will have diminishing returns.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.958
Sir Lazlo, he protected me in Cintra,

01:16.041 --> 01:18.541
and he said less than perfect means death.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.333
Your stomach's growling loud enough
to wake the dead,

01:21.833 --> 01:22.916
if that counts.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.833
Hunger makes for good sauce.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.583
Also makes for shitty lunges.

01:28.083 --> 01:28.916
[gasps]

01:30.625 --> 01:31.916
[snarling]

01:32.666 --> 01:33.500
Ciri.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.208
You are safe here.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.750
Was it the Black Knight again?

01:44.958 --> 01:46.833
-No.
-If he's still haunting you--

01:46.916 --> 01:48.500
Whose turn is it for lunch?

02:05.708 --> 02:06.625
[Lambert] Coen!

02:07.166 --> 02:10.625
What's the difference
between a witcher and a heap of shit?

02:11.791 --> 02:12.666
Well, go on, then.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.625
Eventually, the shit will stop smelling.
[guffaws]

02:15.708 --> 02:17.625
That joke's old as the Conjunction.

02:17.708 --> 02:20.416
Well, you tell me one, then,
you comedic fuck.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.250
All right.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.458
What do you call a witcher with no brains?

02:25.541 --> 02:26.500
Lambert?

02:27.541 --> 02:28.416
[laughs]

02:29.416 --> 02:31.208
Okay, now she's funny.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.416
Oh, Lambert!

02:40.333 --> 02:42.916
When you finish this, get some rest.

02:45.458 --> 02:46.291
Ciri.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.500
Trouble with the pretty, pretty princess?

02:55.583 --> 02:57.375
-Leave it alone.
-Why should I?

02:57.958 --> 02:59.458
He made his choice.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.000
Cost us a brother.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.250
That wasn't our brother.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.833
Not by the end of it.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.166
And bitterness won't help us
find what killed him.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.083
[Lambert] Oh, I know what killed him.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.375
[Coen] Leave it alone.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.500
[sighs]

03:32.583 --> 03:34.125
[Eskel] Wait, Geralt…

03:37.500 --> 03:38.625
[Geralt] Eskel?

03:38.708 --> 03:40.125
Sorrel's waiting for us.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.833
No, no. [sighs]

03:42.916 --> 03:44.041
I'm finished, mate.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.208
We're finished
when we're counting worms in the ground,

03:46.291 --> 03:48.375
-not after an hour on the combs.
-[laughs]

03:48.875 --> 03:50.250
Three fucking hours.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.291
You sound just like Vesemir.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.583
Last I checked,
we come here to rest in the winter,

03:57.083 --> 03:59.833
and to restore, and to have some fun,

04:00.375 --> 04:02.458
not train till our legs give out.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.333
-Legs seem fine to me.
-Arsehole.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.125
I haven't seen you this sore
since Vesemir tanned our hides

04:12.208 --> 04:14.083
for tying that thread
to the bumblebee's leg.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.333
[laughs]

04:15.416 --> 04:19.375
It wasn't the thread that was the problem.
It was the jug we tied to the other end.

04:19.958 --> 04:23.166
"If you don't leave that bee in peace,
you'll feel my sting again."

04:23.250 --> 04:25.250
[chuckles] See, you're just like him.

04:26.791 --> 04:28.208
We're all just like him.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.041
We won't get any rest.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.125
None of us will have any peace

04:34.125 --> 04:36.375
until there are no monsters left
in the world.

04:37.708 --> 04:40.666
-Until our life's mission is complete.
-Which will be never.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.458
-'Cause what else would we do?
-Exactly.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.750
Come on.

04:48.041 --> 04:51.416
-One more hour.
-[sighs] Fine. One more hour.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.041
Then you can hang what's left of me
on the medallion tree.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.458
-[laughs]
-[Geralt] Hah.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.166
[Eskel] Just like…

05:04.500 --> 05:05.583
[sighs]

05:05.666 --> 05:07.166
[crunching]

05:09.750 --> 05:11.875
-[loud crack]
-[scraping]

05:14.375 --> 05:15.958
-[door opens]
-[squelching]

05:20.916 --> 05:21.958
Thank you, Wolf.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.083
Don't thank me yet.
It was Lambert's turn to cook.

05:28.958 --> 05:30.208
[Vesemir sighs]

05:34.541 --> 05:37.291
[sighs] This shouldn't have happened.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.125
We shouldn't have lost him this way.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.875
I know.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.166
There must be more tests I can run
to track whatever mutated the other leshy.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.958
If there was a scientific explanation
for any of this,

05:51.958 --> 05:53.333
you would've found it by now.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.625
We've got a lab
full of alchemical compounds

05:55.708 --> 05:57.916
that can change day to fucking night.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not going to give up now.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.875
I'm not asking you to give up.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.083
[sighs]

06:03.750 --> 06:05.708
But it's time to let Eskel rest.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.083
He deserves the peace.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.500
[inhales] Yeah.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.833
[wind rushing]

07:08.458 --> 07:10.458
[seabirds calling]

07:19.458 --> 07:22.791
[Artorius] So tell us, Istredd,
while at the Nilfgaardian dig site,

07:22.875 --> 07:26.708
did you absorb
any insight into their followers?

07:27.833 --> 07:30.583
I absorbed nothing.
Except perhaps some dirt.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.458
Archaeological dig sites
being what they are.

07:33.541 --> 07:38.750
A respected mage, and even he found
no indication of their plan to attack.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.166
How could any of us have known?

07:42.250 --> 07:43.333
Because we told you.

07:43.416 --> 07:47.791
[scoffs] Vilgefortz had one good hunch
about Nilfgaard's military strategy.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.583
A hunch that saved the Continent.

07:50.666 --> 07:54.750
Ah, I am not here to glorify my part
in our victory in Sodden.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.000
Nor to watch you
perform feigned inquisitions

07:58.083 --> 08:00.333
-to distract from your failures.
-Hmm.

08:00.416 --> 08:04.458
The Northern kings are coming
for the memorial, and they need answers.

08:04.541 --> 08:06.750
The Nilfgaardian prisoner
hasn't proven fruitful.

08:07.958 --> 08:10.541
There's evidence
of a magical barrier in his head.

08:13.041 --> 08:16.208
-So we need to search elsewhere.
-Yeah, I would help if I could.

08:16.291 --> 08:18.458
But I wasn't there to study Nilfgaard.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.208
I was there to study monoliths.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.666
They hold the history of this Continent.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.875
I think they hold our future too.

08:26.958 --> 08:30.708
A future that will soon go to hell
now that the elves are flocking to Cintra.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.041
If we want to keep our people safe,

08:33.125 --> 08:35.875
we'd be wise
to recognize the enemies in our midst.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.500
The elves are not our enemies.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.916
They've already aligned with Nilfgaard,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.833
proving what many of us
have known for centuries.

08:43.916 --> 08:45.291
They cannot be trusted.

08:46.666 --> 08:49.666
If we don't control this now,

08:51.208 --> 08:52.375
it'll grow

08:53.291 --> 08:56.041
beyond even our capabilities.

08:58.666 --> 09:01.958
We'll be burying a lot more
than 14 mages then.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.291
[Yennefer] Thirteen.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.458
[whispering]

09:06.000 --> 09:07.250
Yenna.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.000
[Tissaia] I waited a month

09:28.583 --> 09:29.666
to carve it.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.250
Mm-hm?

09:33.875 --> 09:35.125
[wind gusts]

09:37.458 --> 09:39.000
What was happening in there?

09:40.125 --> 09:41.583
It's tumultuous. [sighs]

09:41.666 --> 09:44.375
Artorius can feel his grasp
on the leadership slipping.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.375
-And Stregobor is--
-A fuckhead.

09:47.125 --> 09:47.958
Desperate.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.708
Which makes him dangerous.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.333
-I need to tell you something.
-Let me speak first.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Your actions

09:58.500 --> 10:00.416
turned the tide at Sodden Hill.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.208
You are a hero to me and many others.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.708
But we need to let Vilgefortz carry
the mantle of victory for now.

10:13.958 --> 10:16.291
-You want me to lay low.
-I need you to.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.750
Because you and Vilgefortz
are making a play for their seats.

10:21.833 --> 10:24.833
We know it's dangerous,
but this is not the time to be weak.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.208
It's the time to be strong.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.458
Just like you were at Sodden.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.083
You did what you had to do.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.583
And I, for one, will always be grateful
for your sacrifice.

10:43.666 --> 10:44.625
[laughs ruefully]

10:59.666 --> 11:01.208
[man] Make sure you have your papers!

11:01.291 --> 11:02.625
[bustle of voices]

11:04.083 --> 11:06.666
[Filavandrel] They're coming to Xin'trea
from everywhere.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.875
A place of refuge,

11:09.500 --> 11:11.000
where elves can be safe.

11:12.541 --> 11:16.166
Our scouts tell us the North
has turned against the elves completely.

11:16.958 --> 11:18.833
-[Francesca] It wasn't that far to turn.
-Yes.

11:18.916 --> 11:21.458
But our immigration to Xin'trea
has inflamed tensions.

11:22.541 --> 11:25.208
With Nilfgaard, who will protect us.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.333
I've never known a human to give
out of the kindness of his heart.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.916
[Francesca] Yes, there's a cost.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.083
But if it saves our people,
it's one I'm happy to pay.

11:35.166 --> 11:38.208
-You say that now.
-Because I stand in the here and now.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.916
Where Ithlinne wanted us.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.708
Go. Eat meat.

11:43.625 --> 11:44.625
Be happy.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.541
We're safe here.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.458
I hope so.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.916
-[inhales deeply]
-[horse whinnies]

12:02.125 --> 12:03.000
[gasps]

12:03.083 --> 12:04.416
Gettin' tired?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.500
[breathing heavily]

12:07.500 --> 12:11.208
Do you remember wasting your time
battling sacks of straw, Coen?

12:11.708 --> 12:12.750
Can't say I do.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.875
[panting] What did you do, then?

12:16.958 --> 12:18.208
[chuckles]

12:19.708 --> 12:20.833
I don't think so.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.583
Some things are far too scary
for little girls.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.666
I'm not little, and I'm not afraid.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.291
That's easy to say.
But our road is a dark one.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.166
Full of dangers.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.208
Is that what you want?

12:36.791 --> 12:39.875
I want to do what a witcher does.

12:40.666 --> 12:41.833
[chuckles]

12:45.458 --> 12:46.583
[grunts]

12:51.750 --> 12:52.833
Come on, then.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.291
Afraid to break a nail, Princess?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.041
[crashing]

13:35.541 --> 13:37.291
[sails snapping]

13:39.416 --> 13:40.750
[blades swishing]

13:41.333 --> 13:43.875
-[wood creaking]
-[Lambert] Give it a try.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.375
Go on.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.333
[poles swooshing]

13:55.208 --> 13:56.708
[Coen] Are you sure about this?

13:57.458 --> 13:59.208
I'm just having a little fun.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.000
[yelp[s]

14:19.958 --> 14:21.291
[coughing]

14:29.166 --> 14:30.958
Still wanna be a witcher?

14:32.291 --> 14:33.666
[gasps]

14:35.958 --> 14:37.958
[birdsong]

14:47.083 --> 14:49.000
[Vesemir grunts] Now you can rest.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.333
[sobbing quietly]

14:58.250 --> 15:00.250
[wolf howling]

15:01.833 --> 15:03.125
[sighs heavily]

15:04.291 --> 15:05.666
[Vesemir sniffling]

15:20.875 --> 15:22.958
[sniffles and sighs]

15:26.458 --> 15:27.833
[Vesemir sighs deeply]

15:31.958 --> 15:33.291
None of this makes sense.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.875
Death by a mutating leshy.
Find that in our annals.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.625
How did we miss this?

15:45.291 --> 15:48.333
I feel like the Continent's evolving
underneath our feet and…

15:50.666 --> 15:51.916
we didn't see it coming.

15:54.541 --> 15:57.916
Maybe another Conjunction'll come along
and change it all again.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.375
I know you think I'm mad,

16:03.750 --> 16:05.708
but I need to know what happened.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.750
If it were your child…

16:11.000 --> 16:13.333
you'd be going crazy to figure it out.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.041
What you missed.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.875
What you could have done differently.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.416
[Geralt] I know.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.500
It's a burden I now share.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.041
[Vesemir grunts]

16:31.083 --> 16:32.375
[wolves snarling]

16:32.458 --> 16:34.125
-[howling]
-[Geralt] They're here.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.333
[howling]

16:47.125 --> 16:49.000
[howling continues]

16:55.250 --> 16:56.958
[speaking in Elder]

17:03.750 --> 17:04.791
[sighs]

17:10.416 --> 17:12.041
[speaking in Elder]

17:18.166 --> 17:20.583
Fuck. Fuck!

17:20.666 --> 17:22.125
-[sighs]
-[footsteps]

17:22.208 --> 17:24.875
Do you kiss your elven father
with that mouth?

17:25.375 --> 17:26.750
We heard you were back.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.250
Word spread fast.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.583
Like wildfire.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.000
We heard about that too.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.166
You survived.

17:36.666 --> 17:37.666
So did you.

17:39.791 --> 17:40.916
How divine.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.208
Indeed, darling. Indeed.

17:48.916 --> 17:50.833
[both laughing]

17:54.291 --> 17:56.041
Come on, join us for a swim.

17:56.666 --> 17:57.875
It's freezing.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.625
Surely the savior of Sodden
would know how to heat a pool.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.541
[speaking in Elder]

18:09.625 --> 18:10.500
There.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.291
You look different.

18:18.666 --> 18:19.708
So do you.

18:20.791 --> 18:22.708
[Sabrina] Oh, the water's perfect.

18:25.000 --> 18:25.958
[laughs]

18:27.416 --> 18:28.583
Come on, you two!

18:38.250 --> 18:39.291
[laughs]

18:44.666 --> 18:46.541
[both laugh]

18:47.125 --> 18:48.875
[gasps and sighs]

18:50.750 --> 18:52.958
-[all laugh]
-[Sabrina] I could stay here a while.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.583
Gods, this feels good.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.375
Like you're alive again?

18:57.000 --> 18:57.916
[chuckles]

18:59.333 --> 19:01.458
Come on, Triss. Join us.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.750
Not today.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.041
Not yet.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.166
You remember Falka.

19:14.708 --> 19:15.583
[sighs

19:16.250 --> 19:18.333
[roaring and rumbling]

19:18.416 --> 19:19.958
From your studies,

19:20.041 --> 19:24.916
you know
she was a power-hungry mutt of a girl…

19:25.000 --> 19:27.333
[roaring and screeching]

19:27.416 --> 19:30.500
…who cried, "Death to all kings!"

19:31.166 --> 19:34.666
when Vridank spurned her elven mother.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.083
[screeching]

19:38.916 --> 19:40.375
Bent on revenge,

19:41.166 --> 19:43.291
-she slaughtered nobility…
-[men scream]

19:43.375 --> 19:44.791
-…priests…
-[swords clash]

19:44.875 --> 19:47.625
-…even civilians, with her bare hands.
-[women scream]

19:48.625 --> 19:49.875
It wasn't enough, though.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.833
She preyed on foolish followers,

19:52.916 --> 19:55.375
-incited a rebellion.
-[crowd cheering]

19:55.458 --> 19:57.916
Together, they burned cities to the ground

19:58.000 --> 20:00.333
and sent rivers of innocent blood

20:00.416 --> 20:02.916
down the streets of Redania and Temeria.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.625
-Anything to reclaim power!
-[crowd yelling]

20:06.708 --> 20:07.708
[Istredd] That's not true.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.458
[screeching]

20:11.500 --> 20:14.375
Falka was a girl forgotten by her family.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.041
She was trying
to rightly recover her throne.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.458
You weren't there, boy.

20:19.541 --> 20:20.833
No, I'm a historian.

20:20.916 --> 20:24.625
Falka was quarter elven,
just as Yennefer is.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.833
What are you saying?
Yennefer's related to Falka?

20:26.916 --> 20:28.125
[Stregobor] Course not.

20:28.208 --> 20:29.083
[laughs]

20:29.166 --> 20:31.666
A historian should know bloodlines better.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.125
[murmuring]

20:34.208 --> 20:37.125
But history does have a way
of repeating itself, doesn't it?

20:39.083 --> 20:40.458
And I was there.

20:41.041 --> 20:44.500
I was there when Falka destroyed Mirthe

20:46.041 --> 20:47.500
and all the mages in it.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.708
Her violence, etched here…

20:53.166 --> 20:54.791
-forever.
-[audience gasp]

20:57.666 --> 20:59.375
[whispering]

21:06.250 --> 21:10.666
[chuckles] I have always tried
to protect our institutions.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.583
To protect…

21:12.333 --> 21:13.166
you.

21:13.875 --> 21:18.000
If we allow Vilgefortz and Tissaia
to take charge of our council,

21:18.083 --> 21:21.333
if we allow our power
to be diluted by elven blood,

21:22.291 --> 21:25.375
-Thanedd will be led to ruin.
-No. Yennefer…

21:26.833 --> 21:28.875
She would never do something like that.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.083
I'm sure of it.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.125
King Vridank was sure
of his sweet daughter Falka,

21:34.208 --> 21:36.125
and then she axed him in the neck.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.250
The only certainty
on this Continent, my boy…

21:43.750 --> 21:45.083
is that no one

21:46.333 --> 21:48.291
is ever what they seem.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.291
[Triss] At Sodden,

21:56.291 --> 21:58.583
after I'd been burnt
by that soldier, I was…

21:59.500 --> 22:01.916
on the ground, screaming, and…

22:03.083 --> 22:04.166
you walked by me.

22:05.875 --> 22:06.833
I'm so sorry.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.500
-No--
-No, I sent you to that gate.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.250
-If I'd have known--
-No.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
It's not that.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.250
We were all there to play a part.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.291
We knew we might not survive.

22:21.666 --> 22:22.958
I remember thinking,

22:24.208 --> 22:26.125
"If only one of us gets to live,

22:27.541 --> 22:28.958
I'm so glad it's Yen."

22:30.250 --> 22:32.375
We will find a cure for your scars.

22:32.458 --> 22:33.875
-I'll talk to Tissaia.
-No.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.625
What's lost is lost.

22:41.041 --> 22:43.041
I'm not on Tissaia's plaque.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.208
I'm not dead.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.500
I have to find a new way forward.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.541
[poles swooshing]

23:10.291 --> 23:11.458
[yells and coughs]

23:12.833 --> 23:14.333
[Lambert] That all you got, girl?

23:14.416 --> 23:15.500
[Coen] Come on, Ciri.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.750
-Let's go back.
-[splutters]

23:18.541 --> 23:20.416
-You've had enough.
-[coughs]

23:46.833 --> 23:48.000
[yells]

23:51.916 --> 23:53.083
Sheesh!

23:53.166 --> 23:55.166
[blades swishing]

24:05.083 --> 24:06.416
[shrieks]

24:07.041 --> 24:08.083
[groans]

24:08.583 --> 24:09.791
[wheezes]

24:09.875 --> 24:10.958
[whimpers]

24:15.958 --> 24:18.500
-[winces]
-[Lambert] Nice try, Princess.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.791
Admit it.

24:20.875 --> 24:22.291
You belong in a castle,

24:23.333 --> 24:24.333
not our keep.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.791
[bell ringing]

24:38.875 --> 24:42.000
[Hake] That makes 4,000 elves coming in
and more on the way.

24:42.083 --> 24:45.208
How exactly do you plan
to feed them, let alone train them?

24:45.291 --> 24:47.541
How can you be sure
they won't impede our mission?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.416
The White Flame always finds a way.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.250
Oh, just as he found a way
to empower you in his absence?

24:57.041 --> 24:57.916
Francesca.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.958
-Thank you for joining me.
-Of course.

25:03.416 --> 25:04.583
[scoffs]

25:16.708 --> 25:18.166
Trouble with your men?

25:20.916 --> 25:22.625
Are you comfortable here?

25:22.708 --> 25:23.916
[chuckles]

25:24.000 --> 25:26.416
My people are used to sleeping
on a forest floor.

25:27.416 --> 25:31.875
To awaken without the bite of a snake
or the sting of a wasp is a pleasure.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.625
What will it cost me?

25:38.166 --> 25:40.041
[laughs] We're both smart women.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.125
I was told
by someone masquerading as Ithlinne

25:44.625 --> 25:47.375
to come here
in order to find Dol Blathanna.

25:49.208 --> 25:51.125
You were told by someone masquerading as…

25:51.208 --> 25:55.833
Emhyr. To bring you here to fight against
the people who have wronged us both.

25:55.916 --> 25:58.208
You suffered great losses in Sodden.

25:58.708 --> 25:59.708
You need a new army.

25:59.791 --> 26:00.750
[sighs]

26:02.166 --> 26:04.291
We are looked upon as imperialists.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.583
People, they see our black armor
and they assume

26:07.666 --> 26:09.916
that we are here to destroy the world.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.166
But we're not.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.041
We are trying to feed,

26:14.958 --> 26:16.208
to house, to…

26:17.583 --> 26:18.708
to liberate.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.000
You can help us.

26:25.916 --> 26:26.916
How?

26:27.541 --> 26:29.958
The elves know the Continent
better than any man,

26:30.458 --> 26:32.916
Northern or Nilfgaardian, ever could.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.916
I want your partnership.

26:37.166 --> 26:41.750
The Deathless Mother may have
brought us together, but you can trust me.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.833
I want a home for my people.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.375
But, more importantly,

26:49.125 --> 26:51.791
I want a place for our future to begin.

27:00.625 --> 27:01.916
Can you promise me that?

27:07.458 --> 27:08.875
[man 1] …is desperate…

27:10.125 --> 27:11.250
[man 2] …I'm doing it…

27:12.375 --> 27:13.708
…next time, do I need to…

27:22.625 --> 27:23.541
Yennefer.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.541
What are you doing down here?

27:26.625 --> 27:28.166
Staying out from underfoot.

27:28.708 --> 27:29.875
Per Tissaia's request.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.958
I wish things were different.

27:33.208 --> 27:34.083
But…

27:35.208 --> 27:36.041
politics--

27:36.125 --> 27:38.333
Requires a certain type of person.

27:39.041 --> 27:41.083
Calculating. I understand.

27:42.833 --> 27:43.666
Yes.

27:44.625 --> 27:45.791
Of course you do.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
[faint voices overlapping]

28:06.416 --> 28:08.083
[voices and laughter]

28:08.958 --> 28:10.708
[soft groaning]

28:14.958 --> 28:16.958
[continues groaning]

28:29.250 --> 28:30.541
Oh! [laughs]

28:31.083 --> 28:32.500
My condolences.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.208
It isn't the end I'd hoped for, no.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.541
I hate to break it to you,
but you won't meet an end here.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.541
Well, Yennefer of Vengerberg,

28:44.208 --> 28:47.083
it seems mages are merciful.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.083
-[splutters]
-No, we're practical.

28:49.833 --> 28:51.458
Death must serve a purpose.

28:54.791 --> 28:56.041
And mine serves none?

28:56.916 --> 28:58.000
None whatsoever.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.708
-Fringilla told me about you.
-[thump]

29:03.583 --> 29:06.000
Your days as schoolmates. [laughs]

29:14.083 --> 29:15.416
She envied you.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.458
[laughs softly]

29:18.500 --> 29:19.375
Then.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.083
Ah. What's the hurry, my dear?

29:33.166 --> 29:35.916
What is it
with men lurking about this place?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.583
[chuckles] Oh, I startled you.

29:37.666 --> 29:39.333
So sorry.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.750
[yells]

29:48.833 --> 29:50.416
I always pegged you as a pervert.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.875
[chuckles] Oh, I'd never demean myself
with the likes of you,

29:54.583 --> 29:55.416
quarter blood.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.166
I prefer Hero of Sodden.

29:57.250 --> 30:00.625
Heroes don't go mysteriously missing
for a month after battle.

30:00.708 --> 30:04.958
It's telling that you don't understand
such complex concepts as prisoners of war!

30:05.041 --> 30:06.000
So…

30:07.583 --> 30:10.041
you were in the company of Nilfgaard.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.541
[echoing] Nilfgaard, Nilfgaard…

30:11.625 --> 30:12.958
Don't get shy now.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.916
We have so much more to talk about.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.666
Tell me how it felt…

30:18.750 --> 30:19.791
[echoing] Tell me how…

30:20.291 --> 30:21.500
…to control fire.

30:21.583 --> 30:22.500
Fuck you!

30:25.000 --> 30:27.125
Or why you returned to Aretuza,

30:27.208 --> 30:30.291
a place you once so colorfully conveyed
that you'd, what was it?

30:30.375 --> 30:31.708
"Burn it all down"?

30:32.791 --> 30:33.625
No?

30:34.333 --> 30:38.625
Well… if you don't want to chat
about your true intentions,

30:38.708 --> 30:42.416
I'll be forced to use a method
your dear Tissaia's grown so fond of.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.791
[intense crackling]

30:47.333 --> 30:49.000
[screams]

30:50.083 --> 30:51.166
[horse neighs]

30:52.750 --> 30:55.041
[screaming[

30:56.416 --> 30:57.416
[Yennefer yells]

30:58.125 --> 30:59.000
[grunting]

30:59.083 --> 31:00.833
[Stregobor] That's more like it.

31:03.208 --> 31:04.583
[Tissaia] Stop!

31:05.208 --> 31:06.125
[groans]

31:07.541 --> 31:09.083
[panting]

31:15.583 --> 31:16.916
[hisses]

31:17.458 --> 31:19.166
[Tissaia] You will answer to this.

31:23.666 --> 31:26.625
I thought the girl
was supposed to be tending your horses.

31:26.708 --> 31:28.500
-[horse neighing]
-She was.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.166
Training's going well, then.

31:34.041 --> 31:36.583
She's a quick study, if impatient.

31:37.166 --> 31:38.416
Sounds familiar.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.500
[horse snorts]

31:41.250 --> 31:42.125
Vesemir…

31:48.041 --> 31:49.416
I'm sorry for Eskel.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.458
I know, son.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.625
And if I was ever a burden…

31:57.208 --> 31:58.083
Was?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.500
-[laughs]
-Geralt!

32:02.250 --> 32:03.666
You need to see this.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.208
[sighs]

32:07.291 --> 32:10.750
[Lambert] I've told you once,
and I'm not gonna say it again!

32:10.833 --> 32:12.458
-[panting]
-Stop showing off!

32:12.541 --> 32:14.541
Steady your legs.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.875
And breathe, damn it!

32:16.958 --> 32:19.083
You're panting like a dying mammoth.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.083
[yells]

32:23.166 --> 32:24.041
[grunts]

32:24.125 --> 32:25.375
[cheering]

32:36.333 --> 32:37.375
[gasps]

32:37.875 --> 32:39.416
-Stay calm, girl!
-Go on!

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
Yeah!

32:47.083 --> 32:48.416
[roars]

32:52.458 --> 32:53.708
[panting]

32:54.208 --> 32:55.166
[shouts]

32:56.125 --> 32:57.791
[groaning]

32:59.416 --> 33:00.916
[wheezing]

33:03.541 --> 33:04.458
[strains]

33:04.541 --> 33:05.541
[roars]

33:36.708 --> 33:38.083
[screams]

34:01.916 --> 34:03.250
[shouts]

34:05.666 --> 34:07.125
[panting]

34:11.416 --> 34:12.791
[groans]

34:13.458 --> 34:14.583
[whimpers]

34:18.875 --> 34:20.041
[coughs]

34:21.166 --> 34:22.375
[gasps]

34:24.750 --> 34:26.041
So close.

34:27.625 --> 34:30.250
You have committed treason

34:30.333 --> 34:33.166
against one of our own.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.791
[murmuring]

34:35.583 --> 34:37.458
Tissaia's pet,

34:38.666 --> 34:40.125
Yennefer of Vengerberg,

34:40.208 --> 34:42.916
survived fire magic,

34:43.458 --> 34:46.375
survived imprisonment by Nilfgaard,

34:46.458 --> 34:48.750
survived capture by elves,

34:48.833 --> 34:53.250
and now returns
to these hallowed halls unscathed?

34:53.333 --> 34:56.000
And we are to unquestioningly believe

34:56.083 --> 34:58.916
that she's here with good intentions?

35:00.791 --> 35:02.958
I'm not saying she is the enemy.

35:05.041 --> 35:06.041
I don't know.

35:08.708 --> 35:09.625
Do you?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.208
I'm simply saying, Vilgefortz,

35:14.750 --> 35:17.958
that if you claim
to want to defend the Brotherhood,

35:18.041 --> 35:21.708
as you so vociferously did before Sodden,

35:21.791 --> 35:27.041
then you must also be willing to defend it
from threats inside these walls!

35:28.083 --> 35:29.958
-[thunder rumbling]
-[heavy rainfall]

35:32.916 --> 35:34.625
[Tissaia] We have no other choice.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.708
To prove your innocence,
you have to kill

35:37.791 --> 35:40.625
-the Nilfgaardian prisoner.
-Is this Vilgefortz talking or you?

35:41.291 --> 35:42.250
The hero

35:42.916 --> 35:43.791
kills the enemy.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.416
Which will prove what?

35:45.500 --> 35:47.125
That you are not a spy!

35:47.208 --> 35:48.916
Or that I am a killer!

35:49.000 --> 35:50.458
[thunder crashes]

35:50.541 --> 35:53.500
I'd be gift-wrapping yet another reason
for Stregobor to vilify me!

35:53.583 --> 35:55.291
Then tell them the truth.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.125
What?

36:01.250 --> 36:03.916
That you are not a threat
because you have lost your magic.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.791
I know you to your core.

36:14.833 --> 36:17.583
Your pain is my pain.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.750
Triss is scarred.
Sabrina's bruised. We're all in pain.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.083
Yes.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.625
-Yes, we are.
-[sighs]

36:32.166 --> 36:33.416
[sighs]

36:37.291 --> 36:38.375
[sighs heavily]

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
For a month,

36:42.166 --> 36:43.708
I've searched the Continent,

36:44.541 --> 36:47.166
trying every herb,
every potion, every spell

36:47.708 --> 36:49.208
to get back what I had.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.666
[sobbing] What I deserve!

36:55.041 --> 36:56.583
Tell me how to save myself!

36:56.666 --> 36:57.708
[sobs]

36:58.708 --> 37:00.666
-I cannot.
-[yells] I don't believe you!

37:00.750 --> 37:02.750
-[gasps and sobs]
-[thunder crashes]

37:03.666 --> 37:06.500
I want to pierce Cahir's mind.

37:07.666 --> 37:12.250
Punish him. Push him towards madness,
all to find out what had happened to you.

37:13.291 --> 37:16.291
-I would have done anything.
-[sighs]

37:18.416 --> 37:19.500
But what is lost

37:20.500 --> 37:21.500
is lost.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.833
[gasps] Without it, I'm nothing.

37:28.916 --> 37:29.833
Oh!

37:32.416 --> 37:34.083
I'm stumbling through darkness.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.250
From the moment we met,
you have been trying to fill a void.

37:38.875 --> 37:42.000
Power couldn't do it,
even when you had it at your fingertips.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.125
-What makes you think it's the answer now?
-Because it's all I have left!

37:51.416 --> 37:52.583
[Ciri] I almost had it.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.375
I can do it.

38:01.875 --> 38:03.333
[Geralt] You can do anything.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.125
[winces]

38:10.791 --> 38:12.416
Doesn't mean you have to.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.208
[sighs]

38:22.750 --> 38:24.750
When a witcher cracks his skull,

38:24.833 --> 38:26.958
all we need do is stick him in a cot

38:27.041 --> 38:30.000
and fill him with veratrum,
spurge, and hawthorn.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.958
Chances are, he'll survive.

38:36.041 --> 38:38.458
You do not have that luxury.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.291
But you said we catch fear.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.958
That you have to face it.
You mustn't just give up.

38:52.041 --> 38:52.875
That's right.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.916
But you have to train first.

38:57.208 --> 38:58.666
Well, then let me train.

38:59.833 --> 39:00.916
I am.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
No, you're not. Not enough.

39:04.125 --> 39:06.166
I want to be a great fighter.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.291
And not just against sacks of straw.

39:16.458 --> 39:19.500
I have known many who wanted
to be great fighters in my time.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.583
Do you know where they are now?

39:26.166 --> 39:27.000
Where?

39:28.416 --> 39:29.666
In cemeteries.

39:32.041 --> 39:33.250
Ugh!

39:40.333 --> 39:41.416
[sighs]

40:37.208 --> 40:38.708
[inhales]

40:45.625 --> 40:48.041
[Istredd] Where are you going?
Are you fleeing?

40:48.541 --> 40:51.125
-Why do you care?
-'Cause I care about you.

40:52.541 --> 40:54.416
If you have an ulterior motive,
you can tell me.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.916
What, so you can
rat me out to Stregobor? Again?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.375
-Oh, come on, Yenna.
-Don't call me that.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.666
I lied to the Council.

41:04.125 --> 41:06.375
I spent time
amongst Nilfgaard's followers.

41:07.333 --> 41:08.416
I talked to them.

41:09.458 --> 41:12.750
Heard how they feel protected
under the emperor, how they feel welcomed.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.416
I haven't told anyone.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.041
But I trust you.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.541
-I'm not a spy!
-I'm leaving for Cintra tomorrow,

41:21.375 --> 41:24.083
to help the elves who are migrating,
to help people like…

41:24.583 --> 41:26.541
Like me? How heroic.

41:27.375 --> 41:30.416
If only you were asked to prove
your loyalty by beheading a man.

41:32.583 --> 41:35.458
Stregobor has spies
stationed on the towers outside.

41:35.541 --> 41:38.208
If you slip out in the night,
you will be caught.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.250
But you were never one
to go quietly, were you?

41:50.708 --> 41:52.291
[whispering voices overlapping]

41:52.375 --> 41:54.875
[old woman] All you lost…

41:57.125 --> 41:58.333
[screaming]

41:58.416 --> 42:00.916
All you deserve…

42:01.875 --> 42:03.291
[cackling]

42:04.541 --> 42:05.833
Come to me.

42:06.416 --> 42:07.958
Come to me.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.041
[faintly echoing] Come to me…

42:18.125 --> 42:19.708
-[Ciri grunts]
-[Coen] Again!

42:22.291 --> 42:24.666
-[groans]
-[Coen] You keep looking down.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.708
That's why you're losing your balance.

42:26.791 --> 42:29.291
Your enemies aren't on the ground.

42:31.291 --> 42:32.750
-[grunts]
-Again!

42:35.291 --> 42:36.125
Good.

42:36.708 --> 42:37.791
Eyes up.

42:37.875 --> 42:39.250
-[grunts]
-Again!

42:39.333 --> 42:40.666
[panting]

42:42.875 --> 42:45.041
You said I couldn't train more yesterday.

42:45.750 --> 42:46.583
Not today.

42:46.666 --> 42:49.916
That strange feeling that you get
like someone's coming after you,

42:51.666 --> 42:53.000
can you describe it to me?

42:56.916 --> 42:57.916
I don't know.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.625
When you think about it,

42:59.708 --> 43:02.083
what's the first word
that comes into your mind?

43:06.750 --> 43:07.666
A pull.

43:09.833 --> 43:11.583
It's… like I'm being pulled.

43:11.666 --> 43:12.958
Pulled towards what?

43:14.416 --> 43:15.375
I don't know.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.208
[Geralt sighs]

43:27.958 --> 43:29.791
If you were to follow that feeling,

43:31.666 --> 43:33.083
where would it take you?

43:40.125 --> 43:40.958
[man roars]

43:42.958 --> 43:43.958
The woods.

43:53.166 --> 43:54.958
[Ciri] What do you think we'll find here?

43:58.583 --> 43:59.833
Why does it want me?

44:01.000 --> 44:01.916
Why me?

44:02.708 --> 44:04.750
I was at your parents' wedding feast.

44:05.750 --> 44:07.375
I saw your mother exhibit…

44:08.500 --> 44:10.666
uncontrolled magical power.

44:12.916 --> 44:15.041
She destroyed an entire throne room.

44:16.916 --> 44:18.458
Given that you're her blood,

44:20.291 --> 44:22.250
I think you've inherited that power.

44:23.458 --> 44:24.833
Or something like it.

44:35.208 --> 44:36.666
Why didn't you tell me?

44:38.416 --> 44:40.833
I didn't want to scare you if I was wrong.

44:43.166 --> 44:45.500
You said you'd never let
anything happen to me.

44:46.875 --> 44:47.958
And I trust you.

44:48.625 --> 44:51.083
Good. It's about time.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.458
[gasps] I think we're close.

45:08.375 --> 45:10.041
[gasps]

45:14.208 --> 45:15.416
It's missing a hand.

45:16.666 --> 45:18.250
It's Eskel's leshy.

45:19.625 --> 45:20.833
[crunching]

45:20.916 --> 45:22.458
[snarling]

45:22.541 --> 45:23.875
[hissing]

45:26.166 --> 45:27.333
[roars]

45:34.083 --> 45:35.583
[screams]

45:42.333 --> 45:44.250
-[shuddering roar]
-[leshy screeches]

45:44.833 --> 45:46.291
[blaring roar]

45:50.625 --> 45:52.666
[roars]

45:52.750 --> 45:54.166
[snarls]

45:54.833 --> 45:55.666
Run!

46:01.458 --> 46:03.083
[high-pitched, bleating roar]

46:10.000 --> 46:10.916
[groans]

46:11.000 --> 46:12.541
[shrieking]

46:19.291 --> 46:21.625
[creature's shrieks echoing]

46:24.958 --> 46:26.416
[panting]

46:35.083 --> 46:36.708
[shrieking continues]

46:44.375 --> 46:46.083
[snarling]

46:48.458 --> 46:50.458
[echoing shrieks and snarls]

46:57.166 --> 46:58.541
[breathing deeply]

47:09.291 --> 47:11.291
[echoing shrieks continue]

47:12.208 --> 47:13.500
[buzzing and chittering]

47:17.208 --> 47:19.166
[screeching]

47:21.416 --> 47:23.333
[high-pitched shrieking]

47:32.958 --> 47:34.208
[screeches]

47:34.291 --> 47:36.000
[bellowing]

47:39.125 --> 47:40.166
[roaring]

47:43.750 --> 47:45.041
[growling]

47:46.208 --> 47:47.416
[snarls]

47:47.958 --> 47:49.041
[huffs]

48:00.583 --> 48:02.250
[growling]

48:17.375 --> 48:19.250
Less than perfect means death.

48:24.333 --> 48:26.166
Sir Lazlo would be proud.

48:27.458 --> 48:29.458
[birdsong]

48:46.958 --> 48:48.958
[Cahir panting]

48:56.666 --> 48:57.833
[sighs]

49:06.958 --> 49:10.375
Can you at least tell me
what purpose my death serves now?

49:11.291 --> 49:12.375
Absolution.

49:14.125 --> 49:14.958
Mine?

49:16.833 --> 49:17.708
Mine.

49:23.583 --> 49:27.666
If the White Flame asks for my sacrifice,
I am ready for the darkness.

49:30.541 --> 49:33.500
It is in blindness
that we find our true strength.

49:34.458 --> 49:35.583
[sniffs]

50:03.875 --> 50:05.666
We thank the Northern Kingdoms

50:05.750 --> 50:09.000
for their generous contribution
honoring our fallen.

50:11.958 --> 50:14.083
May it stand forever on the Hill!

50:14.166 --> 50:15.916
[cheering]

50:23.791 --> 50:24.750
Where's Triss?

50:25.666 --> 50:27.291
She was summoned away this morning.

50:29.250 --> 50:32.375
[Vilgefortz] In Sodden,
we banded together,

50:34.166 --> 50:36.875
to fight not only for the future of magic,

50:36.958 --> 50:39.083
but for the future of the Continent.

50:40.083 --> 50:41.000
Tragically,

50:41.625 --> 50:43.791
our victory came at a great cost.

50:46.958 --> 50:48.583
Vanielle of Brugge.

50:50.958 --> 50:52.333
Atlan Kerk.

50:54.125 --> 50:55.958
Lawdbor of Murivel.

50:56.541 --> 50:58.291
[King Foltest] Look there, Vizimir,

50:58.375 --> 51:00.875
the sorceress that saved Sodden.

51:01.791 --> 51:03.416
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
Think she'll put on a fiery display
for us tonight, Foltest?

51:08.083 --> 51:11.875
I've heard mages embed these events
with spells to prevent magic.

51:11.958 --> 51:12.958
[Vizimir] Yes, well…

51:13.708 --> 51:16.916
my adviser Dijkstra says
she's worth keeping an eye on.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.291
[Tissaia] Kalia de Torteville.

51:18.375 --> 51:20.708
[Foltest sighs] They all are these days.

51:22.416 --> 51:24.625
Our most trusted advisers…

51:24.708 --> 51:26.375
[Tissaia] Wagens of White Hills.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.708
…are becoming less and less trustworthy.
