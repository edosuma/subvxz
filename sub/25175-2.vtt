00:03.600 --> 00:05.227
To my wife, to this woman
who I share a rich life with,

00:05.330 --> 00:07.025

my Inner-most secrets.

00:07.130 --> 00:09.382
You want_me to come
to your ofﬁce? Sam, are
you tracking my phone?

00:09.490 --> 00:12.982
A man we suspect
to being a terrorist
is about to walk a package

00:13.090 --> 00:16.230
into a football stadium
packed with
80, 000 American sou/5.

00:16.340 --> 00:17.159
You're gonna kill him.

Someone out there

00:24.910 --> 00:28.448
Someone made a move,
knowing vaccine stockpiles
would be depleted.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.565
Gareth has been doing
some trades.
We're exposed.

00:31.670 --> 00:34.696
I already sent the assignment
to the assets.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.177
[moaning]

00:37.280 --> 00:40.374
Sorry, I have
a nasty habit of taking
my work home with me.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.999
We're out.

01:42.110 --> 01:43.168
Status?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.886
Eleven cold items
and one warm one.

01:45.990 --> 01:47.526

What am I looking for?

01:55.360 --> 01:58.124
[Jouhert]
Target is 6 ’2’;
brown hair,
navy blue jacket

02:03.290 --> 02:06.839
Two minutes ago,
I've got him heading across
the Key Bridge into Virginia.

02:06.940 --> 02:08.931
[mouse clicks]

02:14.300 --> 02:16.905
He's entering Rosslyn Metro,
Northwest entrance.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.781
[tapping keys]

02:23.550 --> 02:25.598
Got him.
He's on an outbound blue.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.851
[Joubert]
Wheres the next stop?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.257

02:40.330 --> 02:41.467
Train is arriving.

02:41.570 --> 02:43.561
Going to the train now.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.891
[Watcher]
He's getting off the train.

02:49.260 --> 02:51.478
The target just boarded
a yellow. He's headed
back toward the city.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.571
He's in the third car
from the back.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.021
-[automated voice]
Door is closing.
-I'm on.

03:00.150 --> 03:02.141

I'm following the train

He’s oﬁr the train
making for the north exit.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.732
-./'saio’ north.
-I don't want him
to recognize me.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.831
How would he
recognize you?

03:48.840 --> 03:50.421
I'm 30 seconds out.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.521
[indistinct
announcement on PA]

04:33.210 --> 04:35.098
I'm here,
I don't see him.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.383
[Joubert] He should
be right in front of you.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.492
Yeah, but I still don't.

04:47.510 --> 04:50.980
He made me.
I'm on foot. Car's at
the north entrance.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.671
[engine starts]

05:16.780 --> 05:19.431
[priest] Afternoon. You must
be Hector and Maria.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.110
We, uh...

05:21.220 --> 05:22.437
Are looking for a friend.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.713
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were my newly-weds.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.822
Who's your friend?

05:27.390 --> 05:29.381
[Deacon] Hmm.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.021
Sorry, wrong church.

05:50.370 --> 05:52.429
Looks like you found
yourself some trouble.

05:52.530 --> 05:54.532
[sighs]

06:11.070 --> 06:12.651
[cell phone ringing]

06:12.760 --> 06:13.897
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.729
-[man on phone]
Boss?
-Yea h .

06:15.840 --> 06:17.535

06:17.640 --> 06:19.631
-What'd you say?
- They’re a// dead.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.762
Total liquidation.

06:25.890 --> 06:27.881
I'm on my way.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.701
Joe's in the wind.

08:03.190 --> 08:05.499
Everyone else is dead.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.591
You ever seen anything
like this before?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.756
You say that
like we know what this is.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.148
I want this kept
out of the news.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.344
_ I don't want Joe
In any more danger
than he's already in.

08:22.450 --> 08:24.532
I'll just get the victim's
families to comply.

08:25.140 --> 08:26.471
Yes, sir.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.309
I want the task force here.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.671
Here?

08:29.780 --> 08:31.714
Keep it out of Langley.

08:31.820 --> 08:34.744
-You think that's necessary...
-No one knows about this place
outside the Company.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.271
[telephone ringing continues]

08:50.160 --> 08:51.457
Hello?

08:51.560 --> 08:52.629
[man]
We have a challenge.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.721
What kind of challenge?

08:55.650 --> 08:57.641
One of them got away.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.412
It’s Turner.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.771
[sighs]

09:09.940 --> 09:11.760
[sighs]

09:11.870 --> 09:15.283
I think there's a chance that
he's gomg to reach out to you.

09:15.390 --> 09:18.689
You and Partridge are the two
people he trusts the most.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.200
Are we still up
on Bob's phone?

09:20.310 --> 09:23.154
I'm not worried
about what happens
if he calls Bob.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.970
Is that, is that
an accusation?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.310
I've seen his file
from the Farm.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.601
He has no kinetic training.

09:33.930 --> 09:36.069
You think I warned him?

09:36.170 --> 09:40.152
I think it's unusual
that he'd survive,
given his lack of training.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.194
IfI had warned him

09:42.300 --> 09:44.074
he would have gone
back into that building

09:44.180 --> 09:46.717
and try to save
his entire office, and he'd
end up dead, anyway.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.912
So, believe me,

09:48.020 --> 09:49.328
if he's alive

09:49.430 --> 09:50.840
it is blind luck.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.646
[sighs]

09:53.750 --> 09:55.923
We can't move forward
with him out there.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.725
We don ’t even know
what he knows.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.616
He knows about
the companies.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.097
Then that fuck up
was on your end.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.977
But even so, those
companies have nothing
to do with the mission.

10:06.080 --> 10:10.460
Then, why did we just
kill 11 American
Intelligence officers.

10:10.570 --> 10:14.643
Because you cannot keep
12 people quiet. But this
is one person, and I know him.

10:16.530 --> 10:18.191
I can guarantee
his silence.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.792
This relationship could
potentially bring you
under scrutiny.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.653
You need to wipe
your fingerprints
off of everything.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.801
If he comes to you,

10:27.910 --> 10:30.663
you're gonna have to
take care of this yourself

10:31.910 --> 10:34.686
or take him to someone
who can.

10:34.790 --> 10:37.577
lfou are in the home
app/Iances’d/ws/on, Nathan.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.090
Don't you
ever talk to me again

10:39.200 --> 10:42.374
like you're the one
who understands
what needs to be done.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.233
Just as long as
you understand.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.761
[cell phone beeps]

10:59.740 --> 11:01.469
[pants]

11:01.580 --> 11:03.912
[retches]

11:04.020 --> 11:06.022
[vomits]

11:08.390 --> 11:10.608
[Sam] I'm feeling sick.
I'm gonna go home.

11:10.710 --> 11:12.598
Okay.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.712
Feel better soon.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.703
-Gareth will just be
a few minutes, Nathan.
-Thank you.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.801
Welcome.

11:28.330 --> 11:30.321
[sighs]

11:36.940 --> 11:38.931
[sighs wearily]

11:45.950 --> 11:48.123
[Gareth]
Glad you could make it.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.482
Welcome to
White Sands, Nathan.

11:50.590 --> 11:53.252
Would you like a drink,
and can I call you Nathan?

11:53.360 --> 11:54.418
Erm...

11:54.520 --> 11:56.829
No thanks, Mr. Miner,
and yes, please.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.731
So,

11:58.840 --> 12:01.217
My company, White Sands,
we are a private
military company

12:01.320 --> 12:03.902
which means we do the same
stuff that the military does.

12:04.010 --> 12:05.068
But we get paid for it

12:05.170 --> 12:06.421
and I know you're wondering,

12:06.530 --> 12:07.701
"What the fuck
am I doing here?"

12:07.810 --> 12:09.300
[chuckles]

12:09.410 --> 12:11.799
I have a funny story,
Nathan that I heard
the other day. I was

12:11.900 --> 12:14.551
having drinks with this
guy who works for

12:14.660 --> 12:16.878
the corporate parent
of this company,

12:16.980 --> 12:19.710
and he told me about
some mid-level manager

12:19.820 --> 12:25.122
who had multiple
harassment complaints filed
against him by a few of his

12:25.230 --> 12:26.925
Muslim co-workers.

12:27.030 --> 12:29.737
So, apparently,
the final straw

12:29.840 --> 12:31.899
was when he tried to force

12:32.000 --> 12:34.013
a woman in a headdress

12:34.120 --> 12:35.929
-to eat a BLT.
-[stammers] No,
I didn't force anyone...

12:36.040 --> 12:37.132
[Gareth chuckles]

12:37.240 --> 12:38.776
That...

12:38.880 --> 12:40.507
That was wrong,
I know that.

12:40.610 --> 12:42.384
I, I went to therapy.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.947
-Um--
-I thought the story
was funny,

12:45.050 --> 12:46.779
until I learned

12:46.890 --> 12:50.553
that the name of the employee
was Nathan Fowler Jr.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.788
The firstborn son, a namesake
of one of my personal heroes,

12:53.900 --> 12:56.949
I know your brother was
recently killed in Iraq.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.039
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

12:59.150 --> 13:00.720
I did some investigating.

13:00.830 --> 13:03.958
I learned that you
never served, Nathan.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.401
And that's when
it all clicked.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.000
[sighs]

13:07.110 --> 13:10.614
The son of a living legend
underachieves at every
stage in his life

13:10.720 --> 13:13.336
and ends up in-charge
of home appliance sales

13:13.440 --> 13:15.692
for the northeast
region and, whatever,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.062
he's okay with it.

13:17.170 --> 13:18.501
It's fine until,

13:18.610 --> 13:19.986
one day,

13:20.090 --> 13:21.341
his brother's killed.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.987
And then he
is filled with grief

13:24.090 --> 13:27.196
and anger at the people
who did it, and shame

13:27.300 --> 13:29.074
for letting his
younger brother

13:29.180 --> 13:30.795
take his place

13:30.900 --> 13:32.891
in the family business.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.004
And that's why
you're here, Nathan.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.203
There's more than one way
to serve your country.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.722
Now, I have some friends
in_the Central
Intelligence Agency

13:40.830 --> 13:43.401
who are determined
to do something about

13:43.510 --> 13:45.876
the threats
that we currently face
from the Muslim world.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.812
What do you want me do?

13:51.920 --> 13:53.899
I want you to oversee
the whole thing, Nathan.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.107
I want you to be the liaison
between the CIA and myself.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.667
And some of the people
who'll be working for us.

14:00.770 --> 14:02.658
Now, I know

14:02.770 --> 14:06.069
you din't take the path
your father set up for you.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.034
But what I'm offering,
Nathan

14:08.140 --> 14:10.028
is a way for you

14:10.140 --> 14:12.131
to reclaim your legacy.

14:20.550 --> 14:21.403
[clears throat]

14:21.510 --> 14:22.647
[Gareth] Nathan!

14:22.750 --> 14:24.490
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.851
Would you like a drink?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.291
-No, thank you.
-Of course not.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.619
I don't think I've ever
seen you relax.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.096
-No, you're not gonna
see it today.
-No.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.065
'Cause you're upset about
the stock trades, right?

14:34.170 --> 14:36.229
You endangered
this entire mission

14:36.330 --> 14:39.299
for these thinly-veiled
shell companies?

14:39.410 --> 14:40.980
There's only one
guy out there

14:41.090 --> 14:43.513
who still knows about
the companies, Nathan,
he's just an analyst.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.030
Our people will
take care of it.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.631
I had to reroute
the delivery man.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.311
He's supposed to be
in Riyadh by now.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.684
I am our people.

14:52.790 --> 14:56.089
The delivery man can't release
the virus until the last day,

14:56.190 --> 14:59.523
otherwise, people would be
symptomatic, and they'll just
quarantine the place.

14:59.630 --> 15:02.258
We've got a day or two
before he really needs
to get there, Nathan.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.055
I know the schedule is well
as you do, okay?

15:04.160 --> 15:07.288
Everything is gonna go fine.
If you really worried,
go ahead.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.949
Send the delivery man
to Riyadh now. It's not
like he's our only asset.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.665
The Feds are looking
for Joe Turner.

15:12.770 --> 15:16.103
We need to make sure
that we can get to him
before they do.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.303
My, you've taken this
all very personally, Nathan.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.310
That's why you chose me.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.275
I'd like to think that
you would take It
a little bit personally, too.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.769
No, we've already
have enough fanatics
on the payroll.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.568
Your greed is putting this
entire operation at risk.

15:30.670 --> 15:34.162
You need to extract yourself
from these shell companies,

15:34.270 --> 15:37.626
and you need to tell
me anything else that
I need to know.

15:38.390 --> 15:40.130
Okay.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.219
Well, let me set you straight.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.416
I am a businessman, Nathan.
When I see a business
opportunity, I take It

15:46.520 --> 15:49.728
That is_ how I fund_
our operation. Correction,

15:50.410 --> 15:52.025
my operation.

15:52.130 --> 15:54.382
And you may think
your cause is more
important than my business

15:54.490 --> 15:57.789
but my business
is what gives you the means
to fight your cause and, hell,

15:57.900 --> 16:00.755
you wouldn't even have
a cause if it wasn't for me.
Are we done?

16:00.860 --> 16:03.078
-I just want
to make--
-Are we done?

16:03.180 --> 16:05.068
Yes.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.126
'Cause I don't like having
conversations after what's
been decided has been decided.

16:08.230 --> 16:12.007
That is just masturbation,
and I like to do that alone

16:12.110 --> 16:14.101
_ or_ on someone
With nicer tits than you.

16:15.310 --> 16:17.312
(SHUDDERS)

16:34.530 --> 16:36.634
[Joe] We used to live
in tribal societies

16:36.740 --> 16:39.152
where learning to distrust
the people on the other side
of the forest

16:39.260 --> 16:41.956
_was a vital _
evolutionary adaptation.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.358
But the world is no longer
as simple, Sam,

16:44.460 --> 16:46.769
-as us and them.
-No, you're right.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.360
There's just, now,
more thems.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.801
And, by the way,
motherfucker,

16:49.910 --> 16:52.162
you said "vital
evolutionary adaptation."
Drink.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.044
-God, okay.
-Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

16:54.150 --> 16:55.731
Mmm!

16:55.840 --> 17:00.174
If we don't evolve _
beyond us-and-them logic,
then we will go extinct.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.168
-[laughing]
-What?

17:02.280 --> 17:05.943
Did you take
a
New York_7'/mes _
supp05itory this morning

17:06.050 --> 17:08.666
because I can't imagine
how else anybody
can internalize

17:08.770 --> 17:11.261
-so many bullshit
liberal talks--
-Come on, Sam.

17:11.370 --> 17:15.079
You've been over there,
Arabs love their kids
as much as you love yours.

17:15.180 --> 17:18.229
And part of what got them
so pissed off is the injustice

17:18.340 --> 17:21.309
-their children
suffer at our hands.
-You know what?

17:21.420 --> 17:24.639
The most
that any one person can do
morality-wise is to have

17:24.750 --> 17:28.208
his own tribe of people that
he'd be willing to die for.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.323
Keep thinking that way,
and you will just end up

17:30.430 --> 17:34.116
watching your own tribe
getting smaller
and smaller and smaller.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.687
-I came home early.
-[shrieks]

18:00.790 --> 18:02.724
Jesus Christ!

18:02.830 --> 18:04.445
You scared
the shit out of me.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.541
-[sighs]
-Hey!

18:08.030 --> 18:09.201
What are you doing home?

18:09.310 --> 18:10.937
I threw up at school.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.133
[exhales]
I threw up at work.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.650
That's called a coincidence.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.218
You live in the same house
and you breathe the same air.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.800
It's not a coincidence,
you have the same stomach flu.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.241
-You should both lie down.
-Yeah.

18:24.690 --> 18:25.861
I, uh...

18:25.970 --> 18:27.540
[clears throat]
I've some work to do.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.550
Good then, I could
leave Jude with you.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.651
-Where are you going?
-Iris'.

18:32.140 --> 18:33.789
I'm up on the rotation.

18:33.900 --> 18:37.392
It'll be awloNard enough
without having
a six-year old with me.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.788
It's Iris, so I'm going
light on the food,
heavy on the wine.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.621
Not like I'm judging her.

18:44.910 --> 18:46.901
How's she doing?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.230
[sighs] It's been six weeks.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.271
Not great.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.771
[groans]

18:55.880 --> 18:58.166
And I hate it
when my boys
aren't doing well.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.072
When the others come over,
I make them uncomfortable

19:13.180 --> 19:15.171
No, don't be silly.,

19:16.390 --> 19:18.381
But I look forward
to your Vi5its.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.724
Good.

19:20.830 --> 19:22.127
Ijust...

19:22.230 --> 19:24.084
I wish I was
more to you

19:24.190 --> 19:26.476
than a woman
whose husband died.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.431
You are more
to me than that.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.944
That's a light
at the end of the tunnel,
Iris.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.041
You know, Elden and I
did never agree marriage

19:39.330 --> 19:41.321
He had affairs.

19:41.650 --> 19:43.299
And the other women,

19:43.410 --> 19:45.594
they were hard
enough to accept,

19:45.700 --> 19:47.873
but they were one-offs.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.971
The Agency was
his real mistress.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.542
I hated the secrecy.

19:55.510 --> 19:57.501
Smug sense of purpose.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.006
I think they
convince themselves

20:00.110 --> 20:02.260
that they can do
whatever they want because
they're saving the world.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.654
He would disappear
for weeks at a time

20:10.760 --> 20:12.967
and come back not even
acknowledging that he'd left.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.384
When I met you,
I was so jealous.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.060
Jealous of me,

20:19.170 --> 20:20.341
why?

20:20.450 --> 20:21.826
Because I thought

20:21.930 --> 20:23.932
"Here's this strong woman,

20:24.500 --> 20:26.491
a doctor.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.359
There's no way that she
puts up with this bullshit.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.361
Her husband must
tell her everything."

20:32.470 --> 20:34.199
Only now do I realize that

20:34.310 --> 20:36.301
you don't have a clue
who your husband is.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.741
I don't know what you--

20:40.960 --> 20:43.099
I can't believe
I just said that.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.191
-I'm sorry.
-No, I mean,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.351
you're right.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.601
And I guess,
in this community,

20:54.130 --> 20:56.121
none of us really know
what our husbands are up to.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.213
[indistinct chatter]

21:54.470 --> 21:55.562
Task force is here.

21:55.670 --> 21:57.535
[cell phone ringing]

21:57.640 --> 21:58.777
It's my wife.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.529
-Close the door.
-[cell phone beeps]

22:00.640 --> 22:01.732
Hello.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.831
[Joe]
They’re all dead

22:04.560 --> 22:05.538
Yeah, but I'm here.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.221
What the fuck happened?

22:07.330 --> 22:08.501
We have to keep this
under 30 seconds.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.544
There's no time for questions
for either one of us.

22:10.650 --> 22:13.983
Nobody outside the CIA
knew this place existed.

22:14.090 --> 22:15.478
Which means the agency's
been compromised,

22:15.580 --> 22:17.957
which means I don't know
who I can't trust.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.994
I need to bring you in myself.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.670
Can you stay alive
07/ 5 o ’c/ock?

22:21.780 --> 22:23.156
I don't know,
I don't know.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.046
Use the tra/n/ng.
Thats what it’s there for.

22:25.150 --> 22:26.481
The training, I...

22:26.590 --> 22:28.603
I was--
I never expected
to actually use it.

22:28.710 --> 22:31.838
That's what it's there for.
The unexpected.

22:31.950 --> 22:35.249
You remember the park
where we used to get heroes
and watch the game?

22:35.360 --> 22:37.009
[Joe]
Yeah, yeah.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.578
[Bob]
5:11,
at the North-East corner
of the main entrance.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.819
-Can you recognize my car?
-[Joe]
Yeah.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.922
Okay, stay alive.

22:48.610 --> 22:50.601
[sighs]

22:51.690 --> 22:53.692
-[cellphone beeps]
-[line ringing]

22:55.380 --> 22:57.439
[Watcher]
Pa/tridge
made contact with Turner.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.598
They set up a meet.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.850
Okay, good to know.
Nice work.

23:04.390 --> 23:06.199
No, I can't.
It's the collection plate.

23:06.310 --> 23:09.279
This is here for members
of the community in need,

23:09.390 --> 23:13.656
and I say that
you need that standard.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.751
[sighs]

23:17.640 --> 23:19.631
Thank you.

23:30.050 --> 23:31.438
What are you doing?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.076
Just cleaning out
my office.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.068
I'm making popcorn,
want some?

23:35.180 --> 23:37.171
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Hang on, kiddo.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.562
Yes.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.661
Turner made contract
with Partridge.

23:49.590 --> 23:50.614
Is he bringing Joe in?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.608
Personally.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.856
-Good.
- They’re tracking Bob
through his phone.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.211
I thought
you’d want to know.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.821
Thanks.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.909
Look about before--

24:02.010 --> 24:03.705
I should not have

24:03.810 --> 24:06.278
questioned your loyalty,
I apologize.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.451
Rude.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.834
[sighs] What do we know.

24:15.940 --> 24:17.111
Hey, uh,

24:17.220 --> 24:18.289
two shooters.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.085
Pros...

24:20.190 --> 24:21.805
Now, they sabotaged
the electrical vault

24:21.910 --> 24:23.241
which cut power
to the whole neighborhood

24:23.350 --> 24:25.124
so they wouldn't tip
their hand.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.322
And the emergency generator

24:26.430 --> 24:28.295
only powers
the back-up lights in here.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.049
The security was on manual.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.697
Receptionist was poisoned,
something in her coffee.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.735
Likely an inside man.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.741
Now considering this is
the outfit that flagged
Ammar Nazari,

24:38.850 --> 24:42.024
we figure we're looking at
a retaliatory act
of Islamist terrorism.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.018
Nobody knew about
this place outside the CIA.

24:44.130 --> 24:46.473
How'd they know
who to hit to get revenge?

24:46.580 --> 24:48.150
[Boyd] Well, that's where your
inside man will come in.

24:48.260 --> 24:51.752
So, Nazari's terror cell,
whoever the hell they were

24:51.860 --> 24:54.033
just happened
to have an inside man

24:54.140 --> 24:55.710
inside the unit that found him?

24:55.820 --> 24:56.844
Okay. Well,
you have to understand--

24:56.950 --> 24:59.145
All 12 employees of which
were hand-picked by me?

25:01.150 --> 25:03.141
I do have a theory.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.672
Please share it with the group.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.336
Joe Turner.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.930
You think Joe Turner
was compIICIt

25:11.040 --> 25:13.656
in the murder of 11
of his colleagues?

25:13.760 --> 25:16.308
Tu_rner had ties to some
radical domestic groups--

25:16.410 --> 25:17.707
I know all about Joe's past.

25:17.810 --> 25:19.346
It's hardly a basis
for your theory.

25:19.450 --> 25:21.782
Well, the fact that he's not
in a body bag kinda is.

25:21.890 --> 25:22.743
And how so?

25:22.850 --> 25:24.112
[Boyd] He's an analyst.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.199
H_e_has no kinetic
training whatsoever.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.676
Two cold killers come in here,

25:27.780 --> 25:29.793
waste the entire office,
and he gets away?

25:29.900 --> 25:32.209
Have you seen the crime scene?

25:33.020 --> 25:34.647
Yes.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.889
Joe was smoking a cigarette
on the fire escape
with Sarah Tan.

25:36.990 --> 25:38.719
Sarah got cut down
in the alley trying to run.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.162
He came back in through
the window in the basement.

25:41.270 --> 25:42.760
He knew the killers upstairs

25:42.870 --> 25:45.134
had to go down two floors
to make it out the front door.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.617
He only had to run up one.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.711
Doesn't have kinetic training
but he's smart.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.699
Okay.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.186
How about the receptionist?

25:54.290 --> 25:56.281
Her name was Ellie.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.461
She trained with SEAL Team Six.

25:59.570 --> 26:02.198
She wasn't the receptionist.
She was security.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.871
And you notice
that Ellie

26:04.980 --> 26:07.756
and Harold Floros

26:07.860 --> 26:09.634
had coffee from
the same cafe.

26:09.740 --> 26:11.230
Same name written
on their cups.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.001
And Harold

26:13.110 --> 26:15.647
was shot at the checkpoint.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.843
So he's your inside man.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.679
Okay. Well, we hadn't
had a lot of time

26:19.790 --> 26:20.859
to think all that through.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.951
What's your name?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.578
Boyd Ferris.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.977
Ferris.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.378
You don't ask enough questions
and you have too many answers.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.869
When I came in here
asking what you knew,

26:30.970 --> 26:33.029
the answer was nothing.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.121
[sighs]

26:38.370 --> 26:40.372
[buzzing on TV]

26:45.140 --> 26:47.335
-Want some popcorn?
-Hey, kiddo.

26:49.910 --> 26:52.105
-Come here. [grunts]
-[grunts]

26:56.910 --> 26:58.889
How's school?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.729
-It's okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.455
How's work?

27:02.560 --> 27:04.414
Um...

27:04.520 --> 27:06.613
It's not so good.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.381
You seem sad.

27:08.490 --> 27:09.946
Iam.

27:10.050 --> 27:11.620
What's wrong?

27:11.730 --> 27:13.379
[sighs]

27:13.490 --> 27:15.481
Something bad happened at work.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.552
[Sam] Yeah.

27:21.660 --> 27:23.651
Can you fix it?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.091
I don't think so.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.221
Did you try?

27:33.670 --> 27:34.841
Huh?

27:34.950 --> 27:36.952
Did you try to fix it?

27:39.520 --> 27:41.511
No.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.991
How do you know you can't?

27:50.130 --> 27:53.543
Look, I know you have done
some bad shit

27:53.650 --> 27:55.231
in service
of a greater good.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.229
But if you let yourself
become too comfortable

27:58.340 --> 27:59.796
with that blood
on your own hands,

27:59.900 --> 28:02.994
you will sacrifice
an essential part
of your own humanity.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.967
Since when is killing
not an essential part
of being human?

28:06.070 --> 28:07.321
Now you just have guys,

28:07.430 --> 28:09.443
soldiers go out
and do it for you.

28:09.550 --> 28:12.678
Just like you have farmers
grow your food for you,

28:12.790 --> 28:15.133
which, by the way, is another
essential part of being human

28:15.240 --> 28:17.128
that you don't know
how to do anymore.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.571
Well, maybe morally speaking,

28:18.680 --> 28:19.977
we haven't really
evolved at all.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.571
We've just outsourced
immorality to people like you.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.545
You're welcome.

28:24.650 --> 28:25.901
Goddamn it.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.944
I don't mean to pull
the Sunday magazine section

28:28.050 --> 28:29.108
out of your ass,

28:29.210 --> 28:30.939
but, what the fuck
do you tell yourself

28:31.050 --> 28:33.052
that you do for a living?

28:36.020 --> 28:38.011
Yeah, I admit I am complicit.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.955
But I don't let
myself forget it.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.925
No, Joe, you just
torture yourself over it.

28:43.030 --> 28:44.645
I don't see the point.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.183
You know, in fairness, we don't
exactly do the same thing
for a living, Sam.

28:46.270 --> 28:48.283
No, no, no.
You know what? We don't.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.585
We serve the same master.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.054
And what that master
reqUIres of us

28:54.160 --> 28:56.833
is not always fit
to fucking print.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.976
You know, it is
incredible to me

29:01.080 --> 29:03.480
how you can be
so intimately honest

29:04.530 --> 29:07.203
and menacing
at the same time.

29:09.690 --> 29:12.079
-Get the fuck out of my face.
-Fucking pussy. Oh!

29:12.180 --> 29:14.068
Oh. [laughs]

29:14.180 --> 29:16.171
[laughter echoing]

29:20.350 --> 29:21.806
[man on screen]
Johnny?

29:21.910 --> 29:22.763
[object clatters]

29:22.870 --> 29:24.804
Johnny?

29:24.910 --> 29:26.901
[man 2]
Thatis him.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.015
I don ’t have a nose for shit.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.111
Yeah, I can smell it
.700 m/les.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.711
[rounds firing]

29:39.930 --> 29:41.921
[gunshots on screen]

29:44.170 --> 29:46.161
[siren blares]

29:51.460 --> 29:53.451
[Joubert] I know
what you're thinking.

29:57.220 --> 30:00.087
You think it's my fault
Turner got away.

30:00.190 --> 30:03.125
You think I had a shot at him
from the fire escape.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.642
And you're wondering

30:05.750 --> 30:08.753
whether having indulged
myself with Turner,

30:10.160 --> 30:12.299
I might have
been manifesting

30:12.400 --> 30:16.928
some kind of subconscious
de5ire to let him get away.

30:19.890 --> 30:23.018
But if you understood
the nature of my indulgences,

30:23.130 --> 30:24.859
you'd know that
him getting away

30:24.970 --> 30:26.972
is not part of the program.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.513
If you're worried that
over the last six years,

30:33.620 --> 30:34.791
I haven't figured out

30:34.900 --> 30:36.902
that you're a sick,
homicidal fuck...

30:38.190 --> 30:41.227
Without any capacity
for compassion or mercy...

30:42.630 --> 30:44.621
Don't worry, I have.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.191
Good.

30:55.970 --> 30:57.961
[indistinct chattering]

31:08.100 --> 31:10.091
[gate buzzes]

31:11.660 --> 31:13.662
[gate closes]

31:17.270 --> 31:19.261
He's in his car.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.574
Your instructions are to
employ non-lethal measures

31:24.680 --> 31:26.489
where the subject is concerned.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.090
You've only one target here.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.191
[car starting]

31:30.800 --> 31:32.802
He's on the move.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.736
-You a bird watcher?
-Good guess.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.875
Had a parakeet once.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.198
-Died.
-Uh-huh.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.949
Too much there.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.062
How much is that?

31:53.630 --> 31:55.120
-Eighty.
-Uh-huh.

31:55.230 --> 31:56.527
Though I'm not sure why
you'd need to go bird--

31:56.630 --> 31:58.359
I'll take it.

31:58.470 --> 32:00.688
-Done?
-Yeah. Yeah.

32:00.790 --> 32:02.792
I'll take it.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.250
-[Mae] Is Daddy in his office?
-He went out.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.770
Where did he go?

32:08.880 --> 32:11.019
Something bad happened at work.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.121
We're gonna have to talk
to Daddy about that.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.541
What would you like for dinner?

32:19.650 --> 32:21.231
-Pizza.
-Other than pizza.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.910
Burgers.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.250
All right.
Burgers it is.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.298
[indistinct chatter]

32:44.360 --> 32:46.351
[indistinct chatter]

33:13.790 --> 33:15.781
[men cheer]

33:32.650 --> 33:33.901
[explodes]

33:34.010 --> 33:36.012
Jesus.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.731
Shit.

33:43.340 --> 33:45.342
-[tires screech]
-Get in!

33:46.670 --> 33:47.648
[people clamoring]

33:47.750 --> 33:49.741
[woman screams]

34:01.360 --> 34:03.351
[grunts and gasps]

34:04.410 --> 34:06.401
[grunts]

34:08.330 --> 34:10.264
[Joe panting]

34:10.370 --> 34:12.361
-Check yourself for holes, Joe.
-Oh.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.393
[sighs in relief] Yeah,
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.491
[breathing heavily]

34:19.500 --> 34:21.274
[stammering] That woman.
I know her.

34:21.380 --> 34:22.768
She picked me up
the other night.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.121
We went back to my place.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.039
She was there this morning,
Joe, at your office.

34:28.270 --> 34:30.761
You found out about
the money behind Nazari.

34:30.870 --> 34:33.088
-The companies.
-What... This is my fault?

34:33.200 --> 34:34.497
No, you can't blame yourself.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.329
Well, then who the fuck
can I blame?

34:36.440 --> 34:37.532
We don't know yet.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.096
But they've definitely got
somebody inside the Agency.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.576
Now look, I'm gonna put you
in a safe house

34:40.680 --> 34:42.181
until we can figure out
what's what, okay?

34:42.290 --> 34:44.281
Okay, yeah.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.298
Wait. How, how did you know
about those companies?

34:49.410 --> 34:51.037
Dr. Lappe.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.131
Dr. Lappe hadn't sent this
to Langley yet.
I spoke to him.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.891
How did you know that
Bob was bringing me in, Sam?

34:59.060 --> 35:00.925
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sam.
What did you do?

35:01.030 --> 35:03.009
Listen, I'm gonna put you
somewhere safe, Joe.

35:03.110 --> 35:04.725
And when this whole
thing is over with,

35:04.830 --> 35:06.286
you're not gonna wanna
tell people what we did

35:06.390 --> 35:08.403
because that would mean
that your co-workers
died for nothing

35:08.510 --> 35:10.011
instead of being
sacrificed heroically

35:10.120 --> 35:12.111
_ so that countless
American lives could be saved.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.292
How the fuck is it possible

35:14.400 --> 35:15.458
that I have known you
for six years

35:15.560 --> 35:17.596
and only now do I realize,
you're fucking crazy?

35:19.290 --> 35:21.429
What do you think you're gonna
do, Sam. Huh? Huh?

35:21.530 --> 35:23.521
-Listen, if I told you--
-[tires screeching]

35:28.330 --> 35:30.332
[groans]

35:32.740 --> 35:34.230
-Where you think you're going?
-[groans]

35:34.340 --> 35:37.036
Hey, hey. Fuck do you think
you're going, huh?

35:37.140 --> 35:39.483
Outside of this car,
the only thing that waits
for you is fucking death.

35:39.590 --> 35:41.399
-I_ don't care.
-Fucking listen to me.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.647
I came here ready to trade

35:42.750 --> 35:44.047
my life for yours
for two reasons.

35:44.150 --> 35:45.765
One, because you are
my best friend and I love you.

35:45.870 --> 35:46.848
-And two--
-[gunshot]

35:46.950 --> 35:48.952
[groans]

36:04.930 --> 36:06.875
No, that would be subject

36:06.980 --> 36:09.255
to mandatory licensing under
the FRAND commitment.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.691
Yes. Exactly.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.291
Yeah. No problem.

36:16.310 --> 36:17.641
Jesus, it would've taken me
three days

36:17.750 --> 36:19.399
to answer that question.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.284
What's your secret?

36:21.390 --> 36:23.381
Having no life whatsoever.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.752
[chuckles]

37:23.020 --> 37:26.274
Psst, psst, psst.
You here, sweetness?

37:26.380 --> 37:27.870
-[cat meows]
-How are you?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.971
-[purrs]
-Yeah.

37:35.110 --> 37:37.487
Okay. Okay.

37:37.590 --> 37:39.706
Okay. Eat up.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.591
See you later, Syd.

37:43.920 --> 37:44.750
[reporter on TV]
Earlier today--

37:44.840 --> 37:46.296
I need to pull

37:46.400 --> 37:48.937
whatever surveillance there is
on the northeast corner of--

37:49.040 --> 37:50.462
Bob. We have a problem.

37:50.570 --> 37:52.822
[reporter]
. . . was Joseph
Turner, on of the employees--

37:52.930 --> 37:54.340
What the fuck is that?

37:54.450 --> 37:55.747
[Manfredi] That's what
I was trying to tell you.

37:55.850 --> 37:58.182
At large and presumed
to be dangerous.

37:58.290 --> 38:00.758
I said I wanted it
kept out of the news
until we brought Joe in.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.590
-I couldn't stop her.
-It was my call.

38:03.700 --> 38:04.849
[reporter]
Information
about the victims

38:04.940 --> 38:06.555
is only beginning
to trickle in

38:06.660 --> 38:07.797
as there was a media blackout

38:07.900 --> 38:09.845
unt/l the fam/lies
could be noh'fied.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.362
Jesus, Marty, you fucked him.

38:12.470 --> 38:14.609
He fucked himself, I made it
harder for him to hide.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.519
Joe had nothing to do
with what happened here today.

38:16.630 --> 38:18.120
I know you think
you did a good job

38:18.230 --> 38:21.609
erasing those arrest records--
Come on, he was just a kid!

38:21.720 --> 38:23.529
-He is still a kid.
-What the fuck
are you doing here?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.631
You think they were gonna
let you run this?

38:25.960 --> 38:27.370
Come on!

38:27.480 --> 38:28.879
You can't just walk around
like yesterday never happened.

38:28.970 --> 38:31.882
-Marty, listen to me.
-Don't touch me, ever!

38:36.330 --> 38:38.548
You are tainted, Bob.

38:38.660 --> 38:40.958
You recruited him,
you trained him,

38:41.060 --> 38:42.391
and your record would be

38:42.500 --> 38:43.717
permanently stained
by his guilt.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.356
Didn't you retire?

38:45.460 --> 38:48.509
The Deputy Director asked me
to come back as a favor.

38:49.630 --> 38:51.769
As a favor to him or to you?

38:51.870 --> 38:53.565
This is not personal, Bob.

38:53.670 --> 38:56.218
I'm not about
to bet someone's life

38:56.320 --> 38:58.777
on you being big enough
to put the past behind you.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.871
You don't have a choice.

39:08.130 --> 39:10.189
[reporter]
Joseph Turner
is believed to have k/l/ed

39:10.290 --> 39:13.544
. eleven of his coworkers
/n a Georgetown tech company.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.629
Here on the street where
Turner l/ves,

39:15.740 --> 39:18.038
in vest/gators are scouring
his apartment for clues.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.449
Friends and neighbors
are 5177/ in shock.

39:32.350 --> 39:34.352
[knocking at door]

39:52.410 --> 39:55.652
-Joe, are you okay?
-No, can I come in?

40:00.260 --> 40:02.728
Uh, I'm sorry.
This was a stupid idea.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.525
No.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.621
No, come in.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.004
What happened to you?

40:09.110 --> 40:10.680
[Joe] Uh...

40:10.790 --> 40:13.497
I don't think
I can talk about it.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.488
Um...

40:15.600 --> 40:16.897
[stammering] I think
if I talk about it,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.092
I'll, I'll sound crazy

40:18.200 --> 40:19.451
and you don't know me
well enough

40:19.560 --> 40:21.562
to know that I'm not. So...

40:24.810 --> 40:27.324
-Something happen at work?
-Yeah.

40:29.410 --> 40:30.468
Okay, if you wanna
talk about it--

40:30.570 --> 40:32.470
Can I just...
Can I ask a favor?

40:32.580 --> 40:35.754
Can I sit on your couch
and just take a minute?

40:35.860 --> 40:37.157
I haven't had any time.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.376
Can I just take a minute to,
to process everything and to...

40:40.390 --> 40:42.585
-Sure.
-Thank you.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.730
Bob?

40:54.840 --> 40:56.956
I didn't hear the car.
When did you get home?

40:58.960 --> 41:00.962
You didn't see the news?

41:01.890 --> 41:03.881
What happened to your face?

41:07.250 --> 41:09.252
It involves your nephew.

41:09.820 --> 41:11.811
What about Joe?

41:15.740 --> 41:18.720
Thank you
for all of this.

41:18.830 --> 41:21.003
[chuckles] It's actually
a service I provide

41:21.110 --> 41:23.101
for all my Tinder dates.

41:26.430 --> 41:27.613
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.210
-I have some work
I have to get to.
-Okay.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.777
So, um, TV's right there.
Bathroom is behind you.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.416
The water...

41:33.520 --> 41:35.511
You know where it is.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.252
[groans]

41:51.020 --> 41:53.011
[grunts]

42:24.580 --> 42:26.571
[speaking inaudibly]

42:30.580 --> 42:33.526
[reporter]
Federal authorities
have so far given
no indication

42:33.630 --> 42:36.440
why the Georgetown tech ﬁrm
may have been targeted

42:36.550 --> 42:38.768
or whether Turner might
have been in contact

42:38.870 --> 42:41.839
with any domestic or
international terrorist groups

42:41.950 --> 42:43.952
prior to the attack

42:45.720 --> 42:47.893
America ’5 capital
is on edge ton/ght;

42:48.000 --> 42:50.855
espeC/a/h/ in the Georgetown
neighborhood where
the attack occurred

42:50.960 --> 42:52.302
and where the man hunt

42:52.410 --> 42:54.025
is centered on alleged
mass shooter,

42:54.130 --> 42:57.258
Joseph Turner who, once again,
is believed to have k/l/ed...

42:57.370 --> 42:59.019

42:59.130 --> 43:02.190
-in an armed attack
this morning at IEP analytics.
-[footsteps approaching]

43:02.300 --> 43:05.372
Authorities are urging caution
for anyone in the DC..

43:07.060 --> 43:08.038
Jesus.

43:08.140 --> 43:10.472
You scared me.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.741
-I have to go feed my
neighbor's cat. He's in Japan.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

43:14.110 --> 43:15.247
It isn't true.

43:15.350 --> 43:16.681
What isn't true?

43:16.790 --> 43:18.963
What they said about me
on the news, it isn't true.

43:19.070 --> 43:21.288
I haven't seen the news.
What do they...

43:21.400 --> 43:23.391
-What do they say about--
-Kathy.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.772
-You know what, you can tell me
as soon as I'm back.
-No, no, no. Stop.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.131
-Don't fucking touch me.
-No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.491
I just need you to sit down

43:29.600 --> 43:30.942
so I can explain
it to you. Okay?

43:31.050 --> 43:32.301
-Please. Don't. Stop.
-No!

43:32.410 --> 43:33.866
-Stop st

43:33.970 --> 43:36.006

43:39.700 --> 43:41.315
I don't wanna hurt you.
I don't wanna hurt--

43:41.420 --> 43:43.718
Stop, stop, stop.

43:43.820 --> 43:45.469
[crying]

43:45.580 --> 43:46.672
Please, I don't wanna hurt you.

43:46.780 --> 43:49.248
Just, please, just breathe,
just stop.

43:49.350 --> 43:50.123
[whispers] Stop.

43:50.230 --> 43:52.221
-Come on.
-[Kathy sobs]

44:14.690 --> 44:16.146
Without knowing
the shooter’s motives,

44:16.250 --> 44:19.151
they wdl use this as
a means to push
their anti-gun agenda.

44:19.260 --> 44:22.070
[man]
Notice all
the elegant finishes
all throughout this home.

44:22.180 --> 44:24.171
The designer life--

44:32.430 --> 44:34.421
[line ringing]

44:36.070 --> 44:38.072
[cell phone vibrating]

44:43.280 --> 44:44.212
[5am]
You ’ve reached 5am Barber

44:44.320 --> 44:46.538
Please leave a message.

44:46.650 --> 44:48.538
[phone beeps]

44:48.650 --> 44:51.426
[Mae]
Hey, just calling
to say I love you.

44:51.530 --> 44:53.521
I 7/ see you when you get home.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.552
[laughter on TV]

45:00.660 --> 45:02.651
[laughing]

45:10.790 --> 45:12.041
[laughter on TV continues]

45:12.150 --> 45:13.879
[laughs softly]

45:13.990 --> 45:15.059
[objects clattering]

45:15.160 --> 45:17.219
[Joe] None of it is true.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.891
I didn't hurt anyone.
I'm an analyst!

45:20.000 --> 45:23.049
There were two people.
They came in and shot everyone.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.468
And then when they tried
to bring me in--

45:24.570 --> 45:26.379
Who tried to bring you in?

45:26.490 --> 45:27.627
The CIA.

45:27.730 --> 45:29.459
You're in the CIA.

45:29.570 --> 45:31.344
Why didn't you just say so?

45:31.450 --> 45:33.236
The other night in the bar,

45:33.340 --> 45:36.116
I was distracted because
I knew about the attack at
ComQuest Field ahead of time.

45:36.220 --> 45:39.599
An algorithm that I developed
allowed us to...

45:39.700 --> 45:41.076
[whispering] God. Okay.

45:41.180 --> 45:42.807
I just need a piece of rope.

45:42.910 --> 45:45.686
Do you really expect me
to help you find something
to tie me up with?

45:45.790 --> 45:47.781
[chuckles] Go fuck yourself.

45:50.150 --> 45:51.686
No, no, no.
That'll hurt. Please.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.018
Put your leg...

45:53.120 --> 45:55.111
-[Kathy sobs]
-Oh, God.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.376
I do not wanna be here.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.471
-Then go.
-I can't!

46:00.120 --> 46:02.122
I can't.

46:06.330 --> 46:08.139
Lie on the bed.

46:08.250 --> 46:10.024
I'm just gonna hold you.

46:10.130 --> 46:11.791
I need to think.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.834
And I need you to be still
for a moment

46:13.940 --> 46:15.931
so I can process everything.

46:16.260 --> 46:18.251
Please.

46:25.430 --> 46:27.421
Lie down.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.760
Thread your left arm
under your right.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.670
Yeah.

46:49.780 --> 46:51.771
Do not let go of this hand.

46:58.030 --> 47:00.021
[quietly weeping]

47:04.230 --> 47:06.266
Please believe me.
This is not who I am.

47:09.480 --> 47:11.471
I need to think this through.

47:11.880 --> 47:13.871
I'm tired. I'm tired.

47:20.850 --> 47:23.023
I'm a light sleeper.

47:23.130 --> 47:24.666
If you move,

47:24.770 --> 47:26.556
I will feel it
and I will wake up.

47:26.660 --> 47:28.651
Do you understand?

47:31.420 --> 47:33.411
[Joe breathing heavily]

47:54.280 --> 47:56.282
[closing theme playing]
