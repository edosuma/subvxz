WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.952
Somewhere on this island,
they have buried $1 million.

00:03.037 --> 00:04.595
They are conducting
a treasure hunt...

00:04.672 --> 00:07.106
Buried on this island?
A million dollars?

00:08.376 --> 00:09.809
Take the chest and keep going.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.744
You really think someone's going to
come after you to get to the clues?

00:18.019 --> 00:20.852
Dig! Let's go. Dig! All right!

00:22.023 --> 00:23.012
That was a bat.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.251
I guess I'm a real
neurotic mess, anyway.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.227
Let's just try and make the best of
the rest of the treasure hunt, okay?

01:53.514 --> 01:56.142
Jump. All of you.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.809
You can't be serious.

01:57.885 --> 01:58.909
Down there?

01:58.986 --> 02:00.419
In the water?

02:00.488 --> 02:02.353
In the water.

02:02.423 --> 02:06.553
Look, guys, I think there's room
for discussion here. Why don't we...

02:06.627 --> 02:09.151
No. No more talk.
We're through talking.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.097
Everybody over the side,
in the drink.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.135
Come on. I mean,
we're all rational human beings.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.397
I mean, why don't we try
and work something out?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.065
After all, there's more than
enough to go around here.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.802
Not necessarily.

02:23.878 --> 02:27.314
Everyone stay
exactly as you are.

02:27.715 --> 02:32.015
The Great Treasure of Kalaniopu'u
Treasure Hunt is history.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.154
Time for the grand finale,
right now.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.426
I suppose you're all
wondering how we got into this mess.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.520
A fair question.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.532
Well, it all started
a very long time ago.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.034
In the year 1759, to be exact.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.661
And someplace
right around here.

02:52.974 --> 02:55.135
Move! Blast ye!

02:59.547 --> 03:02.607
The heathen Kalaniopu'u is upon us.
Come on, faster.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.250
Aye, Captain Dawkins.
Aye.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.292
Come on now, boys, let's run.

03:31.746 --> 03:33.509
Faster, me boys.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.720
Come on, boys.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.043
You and you,
take the chest and keep going.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.704
We'll rendezvous at the Cave of the
Wild Boar where waits Reverend Brown.

04:07.782 --> 04:09.579
And Maggie.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.278
Aye, Maggie.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.377
But, Captain,
what about you?

04:14.455 --> 04:17.185
Here we'll stand. Go!

04:24.398 --> 04:27.663
Gentlemen, load your muskets.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.327
Send them to hell!

04:56.230 --> 04:59.427
A real cliffhanger.
But considering what happened next,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.434
I'd have to say
that Captain Dawkins

05:01.502 --> 05:04.164
and his band of pirates may
have been the lucky ones.

05:04.238 --> 05:07.537
After all, they were just fiction.
Everything else was reality.

05:09.243 --> 05:13.339
Magnum.
I say, Magnum.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.942
Sort of.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.265
Why don't you knock?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.268
Knock? I veritably tore
the door from its hinges

05:35.336 --> 05:39.033
in a vain attempt at civilized entry.
You are late.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.869
Late? Late where?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.637
To the Kalanianaole Pavilion
on the Windward Coast.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.669
The what?

05:48.549 --> 05:53.145
Higgins, come on, I had a rough six
hours at the university last night.

05:53.254 --> 05:57.748
No doubt with that overeager,
underaged coed you've been seeing.

05:57.825 --> 06:02.524
That overeager,
underaged coed is my tutor.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.086
Spare me the euphemism.

06:04.165 --> 06:05.530
She is!

06:05.599 --> 06:07.658
In what subject?
Advanced debauchery?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.669
Business administration.

06:10.905 --> 06:12.304
Dear me.
Whatever for?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.170
To improve the economic side
of my business.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.869
Never mind.
Why are you here and what am I late for?

06:16.977 --> 06:20.276
I'm here about
The Treasure of Kalaniopu'u.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.646
That's my copy. I bought and
paid for it with my own money.

06:24.285 --> 06:26.344
It seems that Robin Masters'
publishing company

06:26.420 --> 06:28.786
has come up with
a cheap gimmick

06:28.856 --> 06:30.756
unworthy of Mr. Masters,
in my opinion,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.723
to increase the paperback
sales of The Treasure.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.522
Oh, well,
I did my part.

06:34.595 --> 06:38.258
Somewhere on this island
they have buried $1 million.

06:38.332 --> 06:41.062
As did the character Captain
Dawkins in the novel.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.397
And they are conducting
a treasure hunt

06:42.469 --> 06:45.097
based on the incidents in
the book to spur sales.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.503
A million dollars?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.166
A mere write-off for them.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.231
A million dollars?

06:49.310 --> 06:52.302
And in the long run much more valuable
with the expected increase in sales

06:52.379 --> 06:54.870
plus a potential motion picture.
Be that as it may...

06:54.949 --> 06:57.144
Buried on this island?
A million dollars?

06:57.218 --> 07:00.619
Be that as it may, you have
been volunteered by Mr. Masters,

07:00.688 --> 07:03.885
who, I might add, finds the
whole thing as unseemly as I do

07:03.958 --> 07:06.654
and has fled indefinitely
to the south of France

07:06.727 --> 07:10.094
to coordinate this charade with a
representative from the publishing company.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.827
Boy, think of the tax problems
I'm gonna have, Higgins.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.664
Think of your duty, Magnum.
Huh?

07:15.736 --> 07:18.170
Your tax problems
are irrelevant.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.240
Why?
If I find a million dollars...

07:20.307 --> 07:21.569
Have you not heard a word
I've said?

07:21.642 --> 07:24.202
You are an employee of Mr.
Masters in this venture.

07:24.345 --> 07:26.677
You are, therefore,
not eligible.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.840
Not eligible?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.179
And late.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.087
Very late, Mr. Magnum.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.352
I trust this isn't a harbinger
of your future work habits.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.922
Thirty-nine down.
What?

07:40.995 --> 07:43.623
"Something that foreshadows
or presages what is to come."

07:43.697 --> 07:45.528
Last Sunday's New York
Times crossword puzzle.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.861
Thirty-nine down.
Harbinger.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.299
You probably cheated.

07:48.369 --> 07:50.837
Why do you need
our medical insurance?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.168
In case anything happens.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.569
I did not cheat, Miss...

07:54.642 --> 07:59.272
Ms. Griswald. Amy.
Mount Kisco, New York.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.641
And I bet you did cheat.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.115
Well, we'll never know,
will we?

08:04.184 --> 08:07.278
What I would like to know is what
my "future work habits" entail.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.915
You know, consist of.
Be consistent with. Inevitably involve.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.960
Oh, I don't think he cheated,
Ms. Griswald.

08:14.028 --> 08:16.155
Yes, thank you. Good luck.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.298
What your job inevitably involves,
Mr. Magnum,

08:19.366 --> 08:22.631
is helping me keep
this treasure hunt honest.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.466
Fine. Honest.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.735
Yo, Thomas!
Where do I sign up?

08:31.712 --> 08:35.203
Ah. Wow, this is great.
One million simoleons.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.682
And all I gotta do is read
this here pirate book.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.548
Rick, I think you're gonna have
to do more than just read it.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.349
You're gonna have
to read into it.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.582
You are required to take
225-year-old clues

08:44.658 --> 08:48.094
and translate that into a
search throughout modern Oahu.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.630
Starting here, the site
of the pagan sacrifice,

08:50.698 --> 08:52.893
as so colorfully depicted
in the novel.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.458
Yeah, right. Pagan sacrifice,
great stuff. Here, baby.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.867
Rick, I don't think
this is going to be that easy.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.737
Who cares?
I have a plan.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.577
They all do.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.105
It is kind of silly, isn't it?

09:08.182 --> 09:10.116
Kind of?

09:10.184 --> 09:12.618
I think it's absolutely
the most foolish stunt

09:12.686 --> 09:16.053
to hit the literary world
since the Howard Hughes will.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.148
I know that I did not
torturously apply myself

09:19.226 --> 09:20.750
to the taskmasters
at Bennington,

09:20.828 --> 09:23.661
then slave in the publishing
houses along Madison Avenue

09:23.797 --> 09:27.631
for the past 10 years to
wind up doing... Doing this.

09:28.802 --> 09:33.205
I'd rather be undertaking what I've been
trained to do, editing Norman Mailer.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.372
With a saber, of course.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.933
Or what about a scalpel?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.205
Doc lbold?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.645
Why not? I could make very
good use of that money.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.740
I can buy
a new set of golf clubs.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.716
And I shall swear
to my patients

09:45.786 --> 09:48.584
that I'll only hunt for that
treasure on Wednesdays and weekends.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.952
Hey, like, I'm curious.
Are there, like, other prizes

09:51.024 --> 09:53.424
for finding most of the clues
or something? Like...

09:53.494 --> 09:55.394
Like a computer?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.362
It's all or nothing,
young man.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.422
Oh, okay.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.635
Hey, like, I'm also curious,
Ms. Griswald.

10:02.703 --> 10:06.070
I mean, what am l supposed to
be doing here? Protecting you?

10:06.140 --> 10:09.007
I mean, because you know where all the
clues are and the treasure's hidden, right?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.441
Wrong.

10:10.511 --> 10:12.672
I trust your mental deductions
in your chosen field

10:12.746 --> 10:14.839
aren't as haphazardly
thought out as those

10:14.915 --> 10:17.475
or you'd probably be bumming off
the good graces of Robin Masters

10:17.551 --> 10:19.576
instead of working.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.553
Now, the clues will be
sent to me one at a time

10:21.622 --> 10:24.182
by the prestigious accounting
firm of Fletcher and Kilroy

10:24.258 --> 10:26.988
in New York to
insure my safety.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.427
And honesty. I mean,
it's just a haphazard deduction.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.295
Listen, I'll see you,
Thomas.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.230
Oh, bye, Doc.

10:34.435 --> 10:37.427
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Magnum.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.506
I'm here to become
rich and famous,

10:39.640 --> 10:42.234
along with my lovely
and charming partner.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.742
Hi.
Cards are over there.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.006
Oh. Hi, I'm Thomas Magnum.
I don't think we've met.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.103
Donna Clemens.

10:47.181 --> 10:49.012
I teach literature
over at the university.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.141
This is hardly literature.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.651
Well, good luck.
I think the contest starts in about...

10:55.722 --> 10:57.212
Exactly 12:00.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.849
Great. Great.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.390
And we will be ready.
Research materials.

11:04.598 --> 11:08.159
We'll be right back with these cards.
My dear.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.271
Safety.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.934
You really think someone's going to
come after you to get to the clues?

11:16.009 --> 11:19.103
Who knows?
And who the hell cares?

11:19.246 --> 11:23.546
Excuse me. Doug Fenwick and Terry Dobbs,
direct from Beantown.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.854
We're here to sign up
for the treasure hunt.

11:32.156 --> 11:35.956
10, 9, 8, 7,

11:36.027 --> 11:41.226
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

11:51.276 --> 11:55.770
Oh, Jonathan, isn't this
jolly good fun?

12:00.051 --> 12:02.042
Well, they're off and running.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.884
In pursuit of the
quintessential sucker's bet.

12:05.657 --> 12:07.386
Why? One of them's gonna win.

12:07.458 --> 12:11.189
And the rest?
I reiterate, Magnum. This is dumb.

12:13.164 --> 12:14.859
Well, it wasn't
Robin's idea.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.155
Maybe.

12:16.234 --> 12:19.169
But if he were a serious novelist
addressing the human condition

12:19.237 --> 12:21.205
in an incisive
and intellectual manner,

12:21.272 --> 12:24.002
we certainly
wouldn't be here doing this.

12:24.776 --> 12:26.266
At least,
I wouldn't be here.

12:26.344 --> 12:29.745
Well, maybe Robin is
addressing the human condition.

12:29.814 --> 12:31.714
Yes? How so?

12:31.783 --> 12:33.842
What bleak aspect
of human nature

12:33.918 --> 12:37.684
is Robin Masters exploring in
The Treasure of Kalaniopu'u?

12:37.755 --> 12:39.222
Greed.

12:39.357 --> 12:43.293
Well, where to,
Ms. Griswald?

12:43.361 --> 12:46.262
The Blue Coral Reef Hotel
near downtown.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.424
That's the vicinity
of the first clue.

12:48.499 --> 12:50.899
You happen to know where that
eminent hostelry might be?

12:50.969 --> 12:52.766
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do.

12:52.837 --> 12:55.032
Robin and I had lunch there when
I was chauffeuring him around,

12:55.106 --> 12:56.664
scouting locations
for this book.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.140
Oh, how droll.

12:58.209 --> 12:59.699
Shall we, then?

13:03.448 --> 13:04.642
Bye, guys.

13:06.851 --> 13:10.548
And so, the Great Treasure
of Kalaniopu'u Treasure Hunt was on.

13:11.089 --> 13:13.557
And the great literary flash
from Mount Kisco and I

13:13.658 --> 13:16.718
were off running on a road
straight to a million.

13:16.861 --> 13:21.457
But for some of the others, this road
might prove to be a little more serpentine.

13:23.334 --> 13:24.460
How you doing?

13:24.535 --> 13:25.627
Close.

13:25.703 --> 13:26.692
To the treasure?

13:27.138 --> 13:30.198
No. To figuring out
the first clue.

13:30.274 --> 13:31.798
What I can't understand is

13:31.909 --> 13:35.003
why we just can't
skip all this clue stuff

13:35.079 --> 13:37.274
and go straight to where
the treasure's buried.

13:37.348 --> 13:38.372
Because, if you had read
the book...

13:38.449 --> 13:42.909
I read the book.
I've read all of Robin Masters' books.

13:42.987 --> 13:45.512
And Mad Buck Gibson
and Tolstoy.

13:45.590 --> 13:49.185
But that still doesn't tell me how
come we just can't zip to the treasure,

13:49.260 --> 13:51.558
skip all this
clue and other stuff.

13:51.629 --> 13:54.097
Because we have to
substantiate to Amy Griswald

13:54.165 --> 13:57.896
and to Magnum that we did in
fact figure out all the clues.

13:58.036 --> 14:00.903
You know, where we need to
start is that Hawaiian village

14:00.972 --> 14:03.304
that Dawkins and his crew
found when they first landed.

14:03.374 --> 14:05.399
Okay, okay, where is it?

14:05.476 --> 14:08.036
That's what I'm trying to
figure out if you'll let me.

14:08.112 --> 14:09.340
Okay, okay, okay.

14:09.414 --> 14:11.109
Okay. Listen to this.

14:11.182 --> 14:13.980
"The high priest
Kalaniopu'u's village

14:14.052 --> 14:17.783
"was nestled in a beach alcove
surrounded by a peaceful placid harbor

14:17.855 --> 14:20.824
"large enough to accommodate
Captain Dawkins' three masters..."

14:20.958 --> 14:22.516
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Fisherman's Wharf.

14:22.593 --> 14:23.924
Fisherman's Wharf. Go on,
go on, go on. All right!

14:23.995 --> 14:26.964
"lt was guarded by an ancient banyan
tree that rose majestically..."

14:27.031 --> 14:29.329
Oh! The Federal Building.
Ha! Let's go.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.767
All right. Don't drive fast
enough to get us killed.

14:41.212 --> 14:42.509
Slow down.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.413
T.C.: We'll have
all of our lives to slow down.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.033
Watch it.

15:05.203 --> 15:07.694
Do you have to be so clumsy?

15:08.406 --> 15:10.135
Très élégant.

15:11.142 --> 15:13.337
Well, fortunately,
we'll only have to endure

15:13.411 --> 15:15.436
this deplorable situation
one night.

15:15.513 --> 15:16.946
Then what?

15:17.014 --> 15:18.914
We go to where
the next clue takes us.

15:18.983 --> 15:20.041
Where's that?
Would you... Shh!

15:20.118 --> 15:22.018
Will you please
give me some credit?

15:22.086 --> 15:23.485
Fine, but give me
some credit, too.

15:23.554 --> 15:24.714
We are a team, aren't we?

15:24.789 --> 15:26.450
We are not a team.

15:26.524 --> 15:29.925
I am the supervisor of this contest.
You are working for me.

15:29.994 --> 15:32.462
Your job is to keep away
the weirdoes and the kooks.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.260
Oh, okay, I can see how that
could be a problem. Watch it!

15:37.135 --> 15:41.037
Look, look, I can't tell you
where the specific clue sites are.

15:41.539 --> 15:45.066
There's no need for you to know.
There is a need to protect me.

15:45.643 --> 15:48.043
So, come on,
let's just get registered.

15:50.781 --> 15:52.373
Ms. Griswald.

15:57.021 --> 16:00.149
Here you are, 2012,
the honeymoon suite.

16:01.325 --> 16:02.849
You're hardly serious.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.394
It's on the computer.

16:04.462 --> 16:06.225
I think you made
a mistake there.

16:06.297 --> 16:08.697
No mistake.
It's on the computer.

16:08.766 --> 16:11.234
I don't care if it's etched
in Paleolithic granite,

16:11.302 --> 16:13.202
this is clearly unacceptable.

16:13.504 --> 16:17.270
We are supposed to have
adjoining but separate rooms.

16:17.341 --> 16:18.968
You're not married?

16:19.043 --> 16:20.977
No!

16:21.913 --> 16:24.074
Look, Mr. Kono,

16:24.282 --> 16:27.183
my company made these
reservations three weeks ago.

16:27.251 --> 16:28.513
Two rooms.

16:28.586 --> 16:30.247
Maybe the computer
did make a mistake.

16:30.321 --> 16:32.186
The computer does not
make mistakes.

16:32.323 --> 16:35.224
Maybe you made a mistake.
I know I did.

16:36.027 --> 16:38.325
I'm terribly sorry,
but it'd be very difficult to move you

16:38.396 --> 16:40.455
as there's a whole convention
staying here.

16:40.531 --> 16:43.432
The Royal Order of Water
Buffaloes from Dayton, Ohio.

16:43.868 --> 16:44.926
You're kidding.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.094
No, ma'am.

16:48.072 --> 16:51.041
Well, then move them! Now!

16:51.108 --> 16:55.477
Or I'll have this place reduced
to rubble! Rubble! Do you hear me?

16:56.047 --> 16:57.639
Maybe we can work
something out.

16:57.715 --> 16:59.080
You'd better.

17:04.255 --> 17:07.156
Hey, pal, you can have
my room.

17:08.593 --> 17:12.551
I wouldn't wish that on anyone,
even my worst enemy.

17:14.799 --> 17:17.790
Come on, Magnum, on your feet.
Everything is taken care of.

17:17.867 --> 17:20.564
Now all we have to do
is find the damn place.

17:24.508 --> 17:25.998
Listen, I know it's here
somewhere.

17:26.077 --> 17:27.669
Hey, you'd better
find it, brah,

17:27.744 --> 17:29.940
otherwise we'll be out a cool million,
you know?

17:30.014 --> 17:31.845
And that'll be the end
of our beautiful partnership.

17:31.916 --> 17:33.645
I got it.

17:37.321 --> 17:38.913
Hey, listen, Kika,
are you sure

17:38.990 --> 17:40.252
that we're headed
in the right direction?

17:40.324 --> 17:41.484
Of course I'm sure, Doc.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.891
The village of Kalaniopu'u is
the village of my ancestors.

17:46.964 --> 17:48.727
Yeah, the village
of your ancestors

17:48.799 --> 17:51.825
has not been in existence
for some 200 years.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.535
We Hawaiians have a great
oral tradition.

17:58.776 --> 18:02.644
Well, I hope that this haole and
this Hawaiian have a terrific future.

18:05.283 --> 18:08.810
Hey, listen, Kika, what are you
gonna do with all that money?

18:08.953 --> 18:11.217
Are you gonna buy out
the petty cab industry?

18:12.423 --> 18:14.516
Are you kidding, man?
I'm gonna live!

18:16.494 --> 18:20.396
No more peddling around those over-sized
tricycles, you know, all over town.

18:20.498 --> 18:24.025
Hey, I'm gonna be like Magnum,
you know. My own estate.

18:24.168 --> 18:28.366
My own red sports car.
Maybe I'll become a Pl, too.

18:29.707 --> 18:34.406
Hey, Doc, you and me are gonna
go downtown, find that cash

18:35.012 --> 18:36.707
and live like kings.

18:36.881 --> 18:38.109
Like King Kamehameha, huh?

18:38.182 --> 18:39.274
You got it.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.284
All right, this is fun.
Let's go.

18:44.188 --> 18:46.782
If they only knew
what fun I was really having.

18:46.857 --> 18:49.724
I mean, it was bad enough being
stuck doing this silly job

18:49.794 --> 18:52.285
with the supercilious
Amy Griswald,

18:52.430 --> 18:55.490
but I was also missing
the Detroit-Toronto game

18:55.566 --> 18:57.056
which was being beamed
at this very moment

18:57.134 --> 19:00.069
Iive and direct from Canada
via satellite

19:00.137 --> 19:03.698
to Robin's new dish and my
comfortable old guest house.

19:03.774 --> 19:06.106
My options here
were sadly more limited.

19:09.814 --> 19:11.782
And, so far, I was really
having a hard time

19:11.849 --> 19:14.716
figuring out what I was really
supposed to be doing.

19:14.819 --> 19:17.788
I knew we were in the general
vicinity of the first clue,

19:17.855 --> 19:22.155
but Ms. Griswald refused to even
tell me specifically where it was.

19:22.226 --> 19:25.525
As if I even cared,
not being eligible anyway.

19:26.864 --> 19:29.628
It was the kind of evening
where I even found myself

19:29.700 --> 19:33.659
rooting for Woody
to fall out of his tree.

19:44.548 --> 19:46.812
Ms. Griswald?

19:52.189 --> 19:53.178
Amy.

19:57.762 --> 19:59.093
Oh.

20:04.602 --> 20:05.626
You okay?

20:06.804 --> 20:07.828
No! It's me, it's me. It's me.

20:07.905 --> 20:10.772
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's okay.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.237
You okay?

20:13.310 --> 20:17.041
Yeah, yeah.
Physically. Physically, yes.

20:17.915 --> 20:20.383
Emotionally, psychologically,

20:20.451 --> 20:23.443
and in terms
of every woman's angst, no.

20:29.226 --> 20:31.421
No, no, you're fine,
you're fine.

20:32.563 --> 20:33.791
It's okay.
Yeah.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.398
All right?
Yeah.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.059
What happened?

20:40.137 --> 20:43.504
Two intruders broke in and
tried to steal the first clue.

20:43.607 --> 20:45.074
Did they get it?

20:45.142 --> 20:48.168
It's all right here.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.307
Well, that's just great.
That's great.

20:55.619 --> 20:57.610
How am I supposed to protect
the integrity of this contest,

20:57.688 --> 21:00.555
not to mention you,
if you don't confide in me?

21:00.691 --> 21:04.422
You're right.
This is all getting too weird.

21:06.697 --> 21:08.824
Okay, I'll tell you
where it is.

21:08.899 --> 21:10.093
Great.

21:10.167 --> 21:13.330
But you've also got
to tell me one thing.

21:13.404 --> 21:14.632
What?

21:16.474 --> 21:18.999
Just where the hell do you
expect me to sleep tonight?

21:24.315 --> 21:25.976
Amy was only half right.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.847
Not only were things
getting "too weird,"

21:27.918 --> 21:30.182
they were also getting
too dangerous.

21:30.254 --> 21:32.484
And it wasn't only her
I was concerned about.

21:32.556 --> 21:35.081
All my friends
were involved, too.

21:36.126 --> 21:37.991
T.C.: Okay. It's here.

21:38.562 --> 21:39.824
Where?

21:39.897 --> 21:43.264
You'd really need a bulldozer
to dig up all this cement.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.133
Not necessarily.

21:47.004 --> 21:49.165
The majestic banyan tree.

21:55.045 --> 21:57.070
Deeper.

21:57.147 --> 22:00.241
Any deeper and we're talking
China here.

22:20.037 --> 22:21.800
We found it. We did it.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.506
They'll hear you.
Let's have a look.

22:30.981 --> 22:36.351
T.C.: Well, great. We found it,
but what does it mean?

22:36.420 --> 22:38.149
I think I know
what it means.

22:39.623 --> 22:40.749
I think I know.

22:40.824 --> 22:41.813
Well, what? What?

22:46.864 --> 22:48.559
Hi.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.595
What are you doing?
What are you doing here? T.C.

22:51.669 --> 22:54.263
Take it easy. The same as you are.
I'm after the treasure.

22:54.338 --> 22:57.171
You followed us!
I thought you had a plan.

22:57.808 --> 23:01.300
Yeah, that's it. I can live on a
third of a million bucks real easy.

23:01.378 --> 23:02.777
Now let's cover
this boulder up

23:02.846 --> 23:04.473
before someone else knows
where to find it.

23:04.548 --> 23:07.073
No, no you can't.
That's one of the rules of the contest.

23:07.151 --> 23:10.348
You can't alter or disfigure an
exposed clue or you're disqualified.

23:10.854 --> 23:12.515
I'm going to alter
and disfigure him.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.855
Just take it easy, you can't.
We're friends and now we're partners.

23:19.897 --> 23:21.956
Oh, we're history.

23:29.773 --> 23:31.900
You're under arrest for
destruction of public property.

23:56.233 --> 23:57.291
You're relieved, Officer.

23:57.368 --> 24:00.462
Downtown wants us
to cordon off the area.

24:00.571 --> 24:01.833
Right. Mahalo.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.969
So far, it wasn't a
particularly auspicious night

24:36.038 --> 24:40.441
nor an auspicious beginning for the Great
Treasure of Kalaniopu'u Treasure Hunt.

24:40.509 --> 24:42.670
I mean, spending the night
folded up on my couch

24:42.745 --> 24:45.873
while Amy Griswald slept
peacefully in my bed,

24:45.948 --> 24:47.916
no doubt dreaming dreams
of what she'd like to do

24:47.983 --> 24:51.077
to Norman Mailer and Ernest Hemingway,
was not my idea of fun.

24:51.253 --> 24:53.983
But I suppose where Rick, T. C.
and Donna spent theirs

24:54.056 --> 24:55.956
wasn't a night
at the Ritz either.

24:56.024 --> 24:57.685
Come on, Lieutenant,
you gotta let us out of here.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.284
You don't know
what's at stake.

24:59.361 --> 25:02.694
What's at stake is eight hours
of sleep down the drain. Mine.

25:02.765 --> 25:05.063
But, Lieutenant,
we're talking about a million bucks.

25:05.167 --> 25:09.695
Look, Lieutenant, we'll
cut you in for 100 big ones.

25:09.772 --> 25:11.069
Rick.

25:13.409 --> 25:16.207
All right. A quarter.
You're an equal partner.

25:16.412 --> 25:20.314
I'm a homicide investigator.
Now, why did you ask to see me?

25:20.883 --> 25:22.908
Because you're the only cop
we know.

25:22.985 --> 25:25.818
And we'd like to consider you
our friend.

25:26.054 --> 25:30.491
And even though I've only personally
known you for a short period of time,

25:30.659 --> 25:34.425
it's real easy to see you're a man
of grace and literary sensitivity.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.623
And we knew once everything
was explained to you,

25:36.698 --> 25:37.687
you'd understand.

25:37.766 --> 25:39.097
And let us go.

25:39.168 --> 25:41.159
Please, don't try to con me.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.761
I've been conned by the best,
like your friend, Magnum.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.137
And I have to say this,
the three of you are rank amateurs.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.770
So I take it
you're not letting us go?

25:50.846 --> 25:52.336
You destroyed
private property.

25:52.414 --> 25:55.645
You're liable for damages and
so is the publishing company.

25:55.717 --> 25:58.845
You got to know that this
is going on your records.

25:58.954 --> 25:59.978
And furthermore...

26:01.723 --> 26:02.917
Tanaka.

26:03.859 --> 26:04.848
Oh.

26:07.429 --> 26:09.863
Right. No problem.

26:10.432 --> 26:12.059
You're free to go.

26:12.201 --> 26:13.793
How come?

26:13.869 --> 26:15.496
Apparently, there was
a misunderstanding.

26:15.571 --> 26:17.801
The federal authorities
were aware of the boulder

26:17.873 --> 26:20.808
and gave the treasure hunt
people permission.

26:21.009 --> 26:24.137
Only thing was, the anonymous passerby
who called us didn't know that.

26:24.513 --> 26:25.810
So, good night. Good night.

26:25.914 --> 26:27.313
Mahalo, Lieutenant.

26:27.983 --> 26:29.541
Just stay out of trouble.

26:55.477 --> 27:00.005
Oh, I'm sorry. I was...
I was dreaming about last night,

27:00.082 --> 27:04.485
those two guys,
and then when I woke up, you were...

27:07.322 --> 27:09.688
Do you know
how to make coffee?

27:20.936 --> 27:22.870
You're not mad, are you?

27:22.938 --> 27:28.274
Mad? Mad? No, of course not.
I mean, why should I be mad?

27:28.343 --> 27:29.435
Being roommates with a...

27:29.511 --> 27:31.240
Don't say it.

27:31.813 --> 27:34.111
How do you know
what I was going to say next?

27:34.683 --> 27:36.810
I'm a good guesser.

27:37.486 --> 27:38.475
And the truth
of the matter is,

27:38.554 --> 27:40.852
whatever you were going to say,
I deserve it.

27:42.057 --> 27:44.389
I've been disparaging you
and this treasure hunt

27:44.459 --> 27:46.188
ever since
they assigned me to it,

27:46.261 --> 27:48.889
and I know you
were reluctant, too.

27:50.032 --> 27:52.193
And I know that if it weren't
for you scaring off those guys,

27:52.267 --> 27:53.461
and then talking to the cops

27:53.535 --> 27:56.436
and then taking care of
everything last night, well,

27:57.172 --> 27:59.800
I'd just be a real
neurotic mess.

28:02.477 --> 28:05.275
I guess I'm a real
neurotic mess anyway.

28:08.684 --> 28:09.673
Thank you.

28:09.985 --> 28:11.179
For what?

28:11.486 --> 28:12.475
Everything.

28:13.388 --> 28:14.650
Sure.

28:16.191 --> 28:20.628
Let's just try and make the best of
the rest of the treasure hunt, okay?

28:20.929 --> 28:22.226
Okay.

28:24.199 --> 28:26.167
So, where's the next clue?

28:26.234 --> 28:28.259
I don't know.
They're supposed to call.

28:35.711 --> 28:37.076
Hello?

28:41.383 --> 28:42.577
Griswald.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.843
Yeah. Uh-huh.

28:47.856 --> 28:51.257
Uh-huh.
Right. We'll be there.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.192
Where?
Where's the next clue?

28:56.264 --> 28:58.732
It doesn't matter. They actually
told me where the treasure is.

28:59.001 --> 29:00.161
Now all we have to do
is show up

29:00.235 --> 29:02.226
and wait for the lucky
winner to get there.

29:02.304 --> 29:03.931
Really?
Yeah.

29:04.006 --> 29:05.405
The whole thing?
Yeah.

29:06.274 --> 29:07.707
Why?

29:07.809 --> 29:08.901
Well, because
of what's happened,

29:08.977 --> 29:10.604
they don't want to take
any more chances with me

29:10.679 --> 29:13.375
or the hunt
getting compromised.

29:14.016 --> 29:16.075
In other words,
we're just supervisors now.

29:16.151 --> 29:17.982
We're through
being roommates.

29:18.053 --> 29:19.042
Oh.

29:22.391 --> 29:23.380
Thanks.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.369
A bat!

29:46.782 --> 29:49.376
T.C.:
That was not a bat.

29:53.822 --> 29:55.289
That was a bat.

29:55.357 --> 29:57.484
Orville, will you just shut up
and come on?

29:57.559 --> 30:00.790
Now, what's a couple of bats
compared to a million bucks?

30:04.966 --> 30:06.627
I'm thinking about it.

30:11.073 --> 30:14.008
Where's that
First Mate guy anyway? Hey.

30:14.810 --> 30:17.608
Let me see. Ah!

30:18.714 --> 30:21.274
Let's see. Okay, here we go.

30:21.349 --> 30:25.410
"First Mate Dick Trevor was
instructed by Captain Dawkins

30:25.487 --> 30:28.650
"to proceed to the Cave of
the Wild Boar where he..."

30:28.724 --> 30:30.316
Wild boar. What wild boar?

30:30.392 --> 30:31.825
Shut up.

30:33.462 --> 30:36.022
"...where he was
to await further instructions.

30:36.098 --> 30:37.360
"Unbeknownst to him..."

30:37.432 --> 30:40.731
He was probably killed by the bats.
Pecked to death.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.504
Probably sucked the blood
right out of his neck.

30:43.572 --> 30:45.506
Shut up.

30:48.710 --> 30:51.804
Well, at any rate, according to the
inscriptions we found on the rock,

30:51.880 --> 30:53.006
we're in the right cave.

30:53.081 --> 30:57.074
Now, all we have to do is
find First Mate Dick Trevor.

30:57.219 --> 30:59.847
Sure. He's probably waiting
just around the bend.

31:18.707 --> 31:20.038
You!

31:20.108 --> 31:21.803
What are you guys
doing here?

31:24.079 --> 31:26.047
We're lost.
Investigating.

31:27.082 --> 31:28.777
Investigating what?

31:28.850 --> 31:31.216
How about one million bucks,
investigating?

31:31.286 --> 31:32.412
Mmm-hmm.

31:32.487 --> 31:34.387
You two guys
better come clean.

31:34.523 --> 31:37.185
Listen, after you were arrested,
the lieutenant called me,

31:37.259 --> 31:38.487
just to make
an official report.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.460
It was really
routine stuff and...

31:40.529 --> 31:43.589
And we decided,
the best course of action,

31:43.665 --> 31:47.658
and since you're all friends of ours
and to avoid any further complications,

31:47.736 --> 31:49.431
was to investigate more fully.
So...

31:49.504 --> 31:53.099
Yeah, so anyway, we were looking at
the snapshot of the boulder clue,

31:53.175 --> 31:55.769
and, really, purely
for background purposes,

31:55.844 --> 32:00.406
we kind of went out... We just
picked up a copy of the book and...

32:00.515 --> 32:02.380
And tried to rip us off.

32:02.450 --> 32:03.644
Mmm-hmm.

32:03.718 --> 32:06.050
And these guys
aren't even registered.

32:06.121 --> 32:07.520
But you are.

32:10.425 --> 32:13.326
Maybe we can be
silent partners.

32:13.962 --> 32:15.691
Silent partners?

32:17.566 --> 32:19.056
That would mean
the split would be...

32:19.134 --> 32:20.965
$200,000.

32:21.036 --> 32:23.368
We can live with that.
Can you?

32:25.373 --> 32:29.605
Unless you want to go back to the
station and answer a few more questions.

32:34.182 --> 32:36.582
Come on.
I think it's this way.

32:44.593 --> 32:45.855
That's it! I'm out of here!

32:45.927 --> 32:47.792
Hold it. Hold it.

32:49.865 --> 32:51.264
Who's in here?

32:51.333 --> 32:53.301
Come out or I'll...
I'll shoot.

32:53.568 --> 32:54.899
You can't shoot people.

32:54.970 --> 32:56.961
Yeah, well,
we can shoot ghosts.

32:57.038 --> 32:58.630
There are no ghosts.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.206
Look, you come out
or I'm coming in.

33:02.444 --> 33:06.107
I'm gonna count to three.
One, two...

33:06.181 --> 33:08.342
Okay, okay, okay,
we're coming.

33:10.452 --> 33:11.544
How's it, brah?

33:11.620 --> 33:13.781
"How's it, brah?" I'm gonna...

33:13.855 --> 33:15.049
T.C.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.385
What are you guys
doing here?

33:16.458 --> 33:18.449
I believe we share
the same general interests.

33:18.526 --> 33:19.550
I mean how...

33:19.628 --> 33:20.686
It was rather difficult,
actually.

33:20.762 --> 33:22.787
When we got
to the banyan tree,

33:22.864 --> 33:25.594
which, evidently,
you so thoughtfully dug up,

33:25.667 --> 33:27.066
we found there was
nobody there

33:27.135 --> 33:29.467
except two
plainclothes policemen.

33:29.537 --> 33:31.300
And they let you
look at the clue?

33:31.373 --> 33:33.568
Well, no.
Actually, we waited for them to leave,

33:33.642 --> 33:37.271
only to find that that clue,
that mark on the rock face,

33:37.345 --> 33:39.074
had been hurriedly
painted over.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.877
So my partner Kika and l
removed that boulder,

33:41.950 --> 33:44.145
we took it to my lab
and we took off the paint.

33:44.219 --> 33:46.016
That's what took us so long.

33:46.087 --> 33:48.214
You mean, the cops painted
the rock over?

33:48.290 --> 33:49.279
I guess.

33:49.357 --> 33:51.154
I'm gonna get their names.
That's destruction of evidence.

33:51.226 --> 33:55.492
That's not important. What is
important is the fact that right now

33:55.630 --> 33:59.430
the seven of us in this cave are the only
ones who know the location of this clue.

33:59.668 --> 34:02.432
Obviously, the painted rock was
a dead end for everybody else,

34:02.504 --> 34:04.836
so the
treasure is ours.

34:04.906 --> 34:06.567
Yeah, that's precisely right.

34:06.641 --> 34:08.574
I apologize for alarming you,

34:08.643 --> 34:10.338
but when we heard the voices
we decided

34:10.411 --> 34:12.380
discretion was the better part
of valor

34:12.447 --> 34:14.608
until we could ascertain
indeed precisely

34:14.683 --> 34:16.344
who it was
that we were dealing with.

34:16.418 --> 34:18.978
Oh, this is wonderful,
wonderful.

34:19.621 --> 34:22.317
How many times does seven
go into a million?

34:22.389 --> 34:23.447
One hundred and forty...

34:23.525 --> 34:24.719
...two thousand
eight hundred...

34:24.793 --> 34:26.226
...and 57 dollars...

34:26.293 --> 34:27.761
...and 14 cents.

34:29.664 --> 34:30.995
I knew it!

34:31.065 --> 34:33.226
Where is this clue?

34:33.835 --> 34:35.735
Right over here.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.938
For in the book, remember,
First Mate Dick Trevor

34:42.010 --> 34:47.346
swallowed that map
just before he was killed.

34:49.016 --> 34:51.417
Well, where is it?
The suspense is killing me.

34:51.553 --> 34:53.418
Oh, my God.

34:55.056 --> 34:56.580
The treasure is here?

34:56.658 --> 34:57.989
Apparently.

34:58.059 --> 35:01.460
Buried beneath my prized bed of
grandiflora Queen Elizabeths?

35:01.529 --> 35:02.757
Evidently.

35:02.831 --> 35:03.991
Why?

35:05.300 --> 35:06.699
I don't know.
I'm just a hired hand.

35:06.768 --> 35:07.928
How? When?

35:08.003 --> 35:09.368
I don't know.

35:10.105 --> 35:11.663
Maybe it happened
last weekend

35:11.740 --> 35:13.970
when you were on Maui and I
was at my economics seminar.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.272
How could Mr. Masters
do this to me?

35:16.344 --> 35:18.608
Calm yourself,
Jonathan.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.012
It probably wasn't Robin,
Mr. Higgins.

35:21.082 --> 35:23.607
I'm sure it was
the company's idea,

35:23.685 --> 35:25.380
because in the book
the implication was

35:25.453 --> 35:28.945
that the treasure was finally
located in a tropical garden.

35:29.024 --> 35:31.993
You know, just before
the oh-so-tragic ending.

35:32.093 --> 35:35.460
And this being Robin's property,
the advance man,

35:35.530 --> 35:37.259
the genius
who figured all this out,

35:37.332 --> 35:40.927
probably figured this was the
closest thing we had to one.

35:41.002 --> 35:43.903
You know, a million dollars
is a million dollars.

35:43.972 --> 35:46.440
We couldn't very well
just bury it anywhere.

35:49.611 --> 35:51.841
On behalf of the company,
I do apologize.

35:51.913 --> 35:54.507
And I'm sure any damage to your
flowerbed will be compensated.

35:54.582 --> 35:56.447
That is not the point.

35:56.518 --> 35:59.180
Jonathan, please.
You'll have a stroke.

35:59.254 --> 36:00.778
I don't care. I...

36:00.855 --> 36:03.653
Ms. Griswald,
telephone, Ms. Griswald.

36:03.858 --> 36:06.190
Will you just excuse me
for a moment?

36:15.937 --> 36:18.132
I still don't see why my
grandiflora Queen Elizabeths

36:18.206 --> 36:20.640
had to perish for the sake
of a cheap publicity stunt.

36:20.775 --> 36:22.504
I'm sure when all this
is over, Higgins,

36:22.577 --> 36:23.566
you can get some
new flowers.

36:23.645 --> 36:25.875
They're not just flowers.
They're...

36:25.947 --> 36:28.347
Big trouble.
I'm glad you finally realize that.

36:28.416 --> 36:31.476
I'm not talking about the roses,
Mr. Higgins.

36:31.853 --> 36:33.343
That was Channel 8 news.

36:33.421 --> 36:36.049
Somehow, they've stumbled upon some
of the treasure hunters at the cave

36:36.124 --> 36:38.558
and they've sent a crew up
there to do a story on them.

36:38.626 --> 36:41.720
I've got to get up there, because if any
of those clue sites appear on television,

36:41.796 --> 36:43.457
the whole contest will be
compromised.

36:43.531 --> 36:44.520
I'll go with you.

36:44.599 --> 36:46.157
No, you won't.
I mean, you can't.

36:46.234 --> 36:48.429
You've got to stay here with the money.
But...

36:48.503 --> 36:50.130
And if any of the entrants
are smart enough

36:50.205 --> 36:52.935
to have figured this part out,
you must supervise the unearthing.

36:53.007 --> 36:54.099
I'll be back
just as soon as I can.

36:54.175 --> 36:55.972
But...
Please do as I ask.

36:56.044 --> 36:58.410
I don't want to lose
my job,

36:58.480 --> 37:00.948
intellectually degrading
as it may be.

37:07.622 --> 37:09.487
I know how you feel,
Higgins,

37:09.557 --> 37:13.823
but sometimes the whims of the rich
and powerful can be very capricious.

37:13.895 --> 37:16.261
But I know
you'll get over it, really.

37:16.331 --> 37:18.162
He's right, Jonathan.

37:18.233 --> 37:20.428
And after all,
how much worse can things get?

37:36.050 --> 37:37.381
Let's go for it.

37:37.452 --> 37:39.147
Dig! Let's go! Dig!

37:39.220 --> 37:41.518
All right! Dig!

37:53.401 --> 37:57.633
My God, there's nothing there.

38:08.236 --> 38:10.261
I demand an explanation.

38:11.017 --> 38:12.507
From me? Why me?

38:12.585 --> 38:14.212
Because you are in charge
of this contest.

38:14.287 --> 38:17.688
I'm not in charge of this contest.
Amy Griswald is, or was.

38:17.757 --> 38:19.816
My job was to try
and keep it honest.

38:19.892 --> 38:22.383
Performed, I might add,
in your typically superlative fashion.

38:22.462 --> 38:23.724
Where is the million dollars?

38:23.796 --> 38:24.956
I don't know.

38:25.031 --> 38:28.091
All this death and mutilation
for naught, for naught.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.635
Really. The treasure
should have been here.

38:30.703 --> 38:33.695
This is the most specifically
delineated clue of the lot.

38:33.773 --> 38:35.104
There can be no mistaking it.

38:35.174 --> 38:36.266
Unless it was a plant.

38:36.376 --> 38:37.707
It was many plants.

38:37.777 --> 38:39.176
Oh, that's not
what I'm talking about.

38:39.245 --> 38:40.803
Then, what, pray tell,
are you talking about?

38:40.880 --> 38:43.644
Doc, what did those cops who
guarded the banyan tree look like?

38:43.716 --> 38:45.581
One was blonde, baby-faced.

38:45.651 --> 38:48.279
The other was a little taller
with a pencil-thin mustache

38:48.354 --> 38:50.288
Iike Boston Blackie?
Remember him?

38:50.390 --> 38:51.379
No.

38:51.457 --> 38:53.118
But I bet you
Amy Griswald does.

38:53.192 --> 38:55.126
Magnum, as usual,
you're not making any sense.

38:55.194 --> 38:56.718
Oh, yes, I am.

38:56.796 --> 39:00.664
Look, you take those mystery
intruders in Amy's motel room,

39:00.733 --> 39:03.167
you add a couple of phony cops
with a can of paint,

39:03.236 --> 39:05.227
and a mysterious phone call
from Channel 8

39:05.304 --> 39:07.795
and you're gonna come up
with a couple of guys

39:07.874 --> 39:10.638
named Doug Fenwick
and Terry Dobbs

39:10.710 --> 39:14.737
in collusion with Ms. Mount Kisco.
I mean, don't you see?

39:14.814 --> 39:18.181
She was spoon-feeding them the clues as
she got them from the accounting firm.

39:18.251 --> 39:20.242
But after the manufactured
incident at the motel,

39:20.319 --> 39:22.549
well, they just panicked and
gave her the whole ball of wax.

39:22.622 --> 39:24.146
Which she handed to them.

39:24.223 --> 39:25.315
Right!

39:25.391 --> 39:27.689
That's a very interesting
theory, Mr. Magnum.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.749
Thank you.

39:28.861 --> 39:30.158
Yeah, and while they're off
stealing the treasure,

39:30.229 --> 39:32.857
we're sitting here
discussing it.

39:32.999 --> 39:35.263
So this bogus clue from the
skeleton is nothing more

39:35.334 --> 39:37.393
than a classic case
of misdirection.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.404
So what are we
gonna do about it?

39:39.472 --> 39:41.269
Good question. What?

39:41.340 --> 39:43.205
Yes, Magnum. What?

39:46.412 --> 39:48.437
We go back to the book.

39:49.182 --> 39:52.481
The last chapter,
right where it gets real tragic.

39:53.686 --> 39:56.450
If James does not make it here, Maggie,
it will not be

39:56.522 --> 40:00.219
because he did not try,
nor does not love you.

40:00.293 --> 40:02.284
It is simply
the Lord's will.

40:02.361 --> 40:04.795
Was it the Lord's will
for him to steal the treasure?

40:04.864 --> 40:08.061
But that was Spanish treasure.
We are at war with them, Maggie.

40:08.134 --> 40:11.831
Captain James Dawkins
was merely doing his duty.

40:11.904 --> 40:13.496
Nothing more, nothing less.

40:13.639 --> 40:16.767
I'll die not having known what
it was like to be with him.

40:16.843 --> 40:20.279
To have him as my husband.
We never should have left England.

40:20.346 --> 40:23.838
Aye, I'll chug one to that, milady.
None of us should have left.

40:26.052 --> 40:27.383
James.

40:28.421 --> 40:29.979
Maggie.

40:31.457 --> 40:33.391
Maggie.
At last, we're together.

40:33.459 --> 40:35.586
Yes, yes.

40:35.661 --> 40:37.561
The four of us.
We must go quickly.

40:37.630 --> 40:39.825
Our only hope is to...

40:46.806 --> 40:48.933
My God, Maggie.
We must flee.

40:59.819 --> 41:01.411
Perhaps now
we can be together.

41:02.655 --> 41:04.919
Yes. Always.

41:15.201 --> 41:18.830
Wow, that's really tragic.
I should have read the book.

41:18.905 --> 41:21.032
And Robin Masters should have
done his research.

41:21.107 --> 41:24.565
Spain didn't enter the
Anglo-Franco war until 1762.

41:24.644 --> 41:28.205
Yes, but who cares? The point is
that they jumped off the cliff.

41:28.414 --> 41:30.314
Right, but listen
to this last paragraph.

41:30.416 --> 41:33.852
"And so the brave Captain Dawkins
and his true love, Maggie Brown,

41:33.920 --> 41:35.785
"plunged hand in hand
over the precipice

41:35.855 --> 41:38.756
"into the brutally churning
waters below.

41:38.891 --> 41:40.358
"And even though
they did indeed perish,

41:40.426 --> 41:42.155
"their love would live
on and on."

41:42.228 --> 41:43.752
What treacle.

41:44.564 --> 41:45.690
I kind of liked it.

41:45.765 --> 41:46.925
That's not the point.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.694
My dear, what is the point?

41:48.768 --> 41:52.363
The point is, there are no
churning fresh waters on Oahu.

41:52.471 --> 41:53.460
Exactly.

41:53.539 --> 41:54.733
But this is fiction.

41:54.807 --> 41:56.399
Yeah, but the scouting trip
I took Robin on

41:56.475 --> 41:58.067
before he wrote the book
wasn't.

41:58.144 --> 41:59.839
He just used
a little literary license.

41:59.912 --> 42:01.937
I know exactly
where they are.

42:40.553 --> 42:42.418
I know
what you're thinking.

42:42.488 --> 42:45.980
Given what happened earlier,
we were walking into a certain trap.

42:46.058 --> 42:47.457
I knew that.

42:47.526 --> 42:50.188
But what Amy and her cohorts
didn't know

42:50.263 --> 42:54.131
was what could happen when the
trappers became the trapees.

42:54.233 --> 42:56.463
Nobody move.

42:57.103 --> 42:58.627
I think.

42:59.505 --> 43:02.474
Don't try anything stupid,
guys.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.982
Jump.

43:15.121 --> 43:16.349
All of you.

43:16.455 --> 43:17.979
You can't be serious.

43:18.057 --> 43:19.046
Down there?

43:19.125 --> 43:20.524
In the water?

43:20.626 --> 43:22.491
In the water.

43:22.561 --> 43:26.930
Look, guys, I think there's room
for discussion here. Why don't we...

43:26.999 --> 43:29.365
No. No more talk.
We're through talking.

43:29.435 --> 43:32.268
Everybody over the side,
in the drink.

43:32.338 --> 43:35.398
Come on. I mean,
we're all rational human beings.

43:35.474 --> 43:37.499
I mean, why don't we try
and work something out?

43:37.576 --> 43:40.204
After all, there's more than
enough to go around here.

43:40.279 --> 43:42.474
Not necessarily.

43:43.983 --> 43:46.577
Everyone stay
exactly as you are.

43:47.820 --> 43:51.722
The Great Treasure of Kalaniopu'u
Treasure Hunt is history.

43:56.562 --> 43:58.587
Time for the grand finale,
right now.

43:59.899 --> 44:03.335
You know, I don't think you're going
to be doing much book editing anymore.

44:03.402 --> 44:06.394
Unless you and these bozos plan
on doing some prison writing.

44:06.539 --> 44:08.734
There's something about
a $1 million payday

44:08.808 --> 44:11.777
that can make you lose
your zeal for working.

44:11.844 --> 44:14.904
Now do as we say.
We've got a plane to catch.

44:15.147 --> 44:16.478
I think you're bluffing.

44:18.617 --> 44:20.551
That's it, I think
a swim will be just fine.

44:20.753 --> 44:22.243
Stay right there, Rick.

44:48.447 --> 44:52.315
Get the rope!
Come on.

45:42.034 --> 45:43.865
I got it! I got it!

45:44.136 --> 45:46.263
Money, money, money, money.

46:09.028 --> 46:13.590
I'm sorry you lost your grandiflora
Queen Elizabeths over this.

46:13.666 --> 46:16.794
Thank you, Magnum.
The gesture is appreciated.

46:16.869 --> 46:18.700
But I suppose that when
one works,

46:18.771 --> 46:20.796
as we do, for someone
as eccentric

46:20.873 --> 46:23.637
and as anarchically impulsive
as Mr. Masters,

46:23.709 --> 46:25.404
we must expect
the unexpected

46:25.478 --> 46:29.005
and learn to live with the somewhat
absurd vagaries of his work.

46:29.081 --> 46:31.140
You're right, Higgins.

46:31.217 --> 46:35.711
I guess you and I'll be doing
this for a long time, too, huh?

46:35.788 --> 46:38.222
You know, together.

46:38.290 --> 46:41.987
Yes, as a matter of fact,
always.
