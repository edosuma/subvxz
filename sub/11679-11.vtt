00:01.101 --> 00:02.864
Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.936 --> 00:05.564
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.638 --> 00:08.129
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.208 --> 00:10.608
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.677 --> 00:13.237
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.313 --> 00:16.441
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.143
Miam i.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.880
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.582
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.656 --> 00:26.557
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.626 --> 00:29.424
an old friend who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

00:29.496 --> 00:31.794
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.231
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.427
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.971
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:41.007 --> 00:42.998
you're not going anywhere.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.774
Previously on Burn Notice.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.109
Someone out there wants you dead.
We both need to know who.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.081
You really gonna do this--
hunt them down?

00:50.150 --> 00:51.777
The enemy of my enemy could be my friend.

00:51.851 --> 00:54.911
I got the chemical analysis
back on the explosion. Professional.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.479
- Any progress finding our bomber?
- Nope. Checked the blast.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.491
Crude I.E.D. Amateur hour.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.187
We recruited you
becauseyou're a good liar.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.287
Guess we can't complain too much
when you lie to us.

01:04.364 --> 01:07.925
Yourbomber couldn't go out the front door
aftertheyset it. Iftheywent offthe balcony--

01:08.001 --> 01:11.198
I could check the security cameras
at the businesses along the river.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.470
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou work for an intelligence agency...

01:19.546 --> 01:22.344
you operate within an official structure.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.679
There's a chain ofcommand to report to,
protocols to be observed.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.946
No one questions their mission.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.784
But when you freelance,
you don 't have those luxuries.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.188
Gettingyour team on board
may require some convincing.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.692
[ Fiona ] I don't have a problem
with hunti ng down someone...

01:34.761 --> 01:36.786
who planted a bomb at your place.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.990
I have a problem with why
you're hunting him.

01:39.065 --> 01:42.159
- Ifthis was about revenge, I'd be fine with it.
- Revenge is a waste oftime.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.068
So is watching TV and eating candies.
You do it 'cause it feels good.

01:45.138 --> 01:49.370
You are finding a killer
for the people who ruined your life.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.876
When I find him, I'll have more on them.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.073
Ah. Intelligence gathering. Right.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.173
He should at least suffer a little.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.218
When I find him,
there'll be some pain involved.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.219
- Areyou happy?
- Delighted.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.221
You see that storage facility?

02:03.289 --> 02:07.248
It has securitycameras that cover
the approach toyourleft from the road.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.524
Here's the name of the service rep
who installed the security system.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.997
And the model number.
You're welcome.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.000
You do care.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.366
Run along before I change my mind.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.838
[Michael Narrating]
Spies love technologyupgrades.

02:20.907 --> 02:25.435
When someone replaces old equipment--
a computer, a cell phone, a P.D.A.--

02:25.512 --> 02:29.175
getting information becomes as easy
as looking through the trash.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.308
[ Southern Accent ]
I cannot bel ieve Phi I didn't call you.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.375
I was up on an install up in Boca.

02:33.453 --> 02:36.718
They had me come down here and do your
service upgrade. I got the paperwork right here.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.223
- Is it gonna take a long time?
- No, it shouldn't be too long.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.453
It's just a simple switch out ofa unit.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.189
Well, Ishouldcheck with them.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.198
No. You should yell at 'em is whatyou should do.
I'm gonna get started here.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.257
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou need to steal information in a hurry....

02:48.334 --> 02:50.734
just arrange
the technology upgrade yourself.

02:50.803 --> 02:54.068
Ron, it's Kay at Evergreen.
There's a guy here doing an upgrade.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.267
But I don't have him
on the schedule. Hang on.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.537
I'm on with Ron Lummer.
He needs to speak toyou.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.943
- Yeah, Ron.
- [ Man ] Yeah, who is this?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.744
No, no, no.
You're lookin' in the wrong files.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.250
It's Evergreen Storage.
It's on your desk by the bobblehead guy.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.344
What areyou talkin'about?
I don't have a file.

03:08.421 --> 03:11.083
- You found it?
- Found what? Who is this?

03:11.157 --> 03:13.148
Oh. Looks like Phil
dropped the ball on this one.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.922
- I'm calling the police right now.
- No, don't be too hard on him.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.964
- Every.body makes mistakes.
- You're breaking the law. Don't touch anything.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.432
You know me, Ron. Anything foryou.
Just save me a doughnut.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.765
- You're goi ng to jai l! I 'm cal I i ng--
- [ Beeps ]

03:23.836 --> 03:26.805
- What did he say?
- Well, somebody's in trouble, but it ain't me.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.637
All right. Sorry.forthe inconvenience.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.610
[Michael Narrating] Ifyou need
to buya few seconds in an office environment...

03:32.679 --> 03:36.342
programming a computer to dial
every.phone in an office simultaneously...

03:36.416 --> 03:38.350
is simple and cheap.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.683
- Just set up your cell phone
to trigger the calls remotely.
- [ Phones Ringing ]

03:41.754 --> 03:43.915
Whoo. Sounds I i ke you guys are busy.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.185
To get away clean from an office,
it's okay to run.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.284
- People run out ofoffices all the time.
- Yeah, Ron.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.124
[ Man ]
Something's going on.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.790
Ifthe look on your face
says "I'm in a hurry."...

03:52.865 --> 03:54.799
- Hold it.
- you can go as fast as you want.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.529
- Thank you.
- It's all about covering ground
before the yelling starts.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.538
Hey! Hey, stop!

03:59.606 --> 04:01.540
[ Ti res Screech ]

04:05.378 --> 04:08.711
"The one you love
is closer than you think."

04:13.720 --> 04:16.779
[ Sighs ]
What's yours say?

04:24.097 --> 04:27.897
"The one who burned you
is closer than you think."

04:27.967 --> 04:30.333
What? What?

04:30.403 --> 04:32.428
Oh, that got your attention.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.633
- Not funny, Fi.
- [ Sighs ]

04:35.708 --> 04:37.699
Is this whatyourlife's become, Michael--

04:37.777 --> 04:40.507
running around like Carla's errand boy?

04:40.580 --> 04:43.014
I 'm doing this so I can
get out from under Carla.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.175
The guy who blew me up,
she hates him...

04:45.251 --> 04:47.310
so I would like to meet him.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.855
I think I found something.

04:49.922 --> 04:53.323
Passed the camera twice in 90 minutes
the day ofthe bombing.

04:53.393 --> 04:57.056
- Right time too.
- Collapsible ladderforgetting
down fromyourbalcony.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.997
Citywork outfit keeps people
from asking questions.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.693
Meet the man who tried to kill me.

05:11.177 --> 05:15.511
- Huh. Kind of ordinary for a spy killer.
- What were you expecting?

05:15.581 --> 05:17.947
You know, afterall this, like--

05:18.017 --> 05:20.918
Boots and a mask at least.
You know, a cape maybe?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.286
His gear is from
City of Miami Public Works.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.087
Capes aren't standard issue.
Fi's checking it out.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.926
Hey, good news--
something to takeyour mind offall this.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.524
- I got a way to score some Dolphins tickets.
- Sam.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.535
Come on, Mikey. When's the last time
you did something that regular people do?

05:37.603 --> 05:40.299
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right there with you.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.933
Fifty-yard line, third row,
beer in big plastic cups.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.068
And how are we getting these tickets?

05:45.144 --> 05:48.477
Buddy of mine-- Shawn Martin,
used to play for the 'Phins in the '90s.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.075
- Hey, uh-- He needs a little favor.
- And there it is.

05:52.151 --> 05:55.314
Come on. Look, we can probably
wrap this up in a day. [ Chuckles ]

05:55.388 --> 05:57.822
We're supposed to meet him at 2:00.

-?? [Man Singing Rap, Indistinct]
-[ Coaches, Players Shouting]

06:05.198 --> 06:08.133
Most ofthese guys I handpicked
in the roughest part ofOvertown.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.534
Pul led them out of broken fam i I ies, gangs--
put them on the field.

06:11.604 --> 06:15.005
See? He's a great humanitarian,
and he's got tickets on the 50-yard line.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.008
Sam said you had a problem.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.239
Not me. One of my players--
CoreyJensen.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.304
Good kid. Stays out oftrouble.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.907
- But he got into a fight the other day.
- A fight? What about?

06:24.984 --> 06:28.647
Notsure. Ijust know
the guyhe fought is bad news.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.518
Felix Cole-- a local gangster.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.184
Word is he wants Corey dead.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.523
Gangster? This is the little problem you--

06:35.595 --> 06:39.156
Yeah. Hey, Shawn, what exactly
were you hoping for here, favorwise?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.462
He's at my place with his sister.
I just wanted you guys...

06:41.534 --> 06:44.264
to go byand talk to him
andsee what the options are.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.805
[ Michael ] Ifhe's being hunted,
he shouldn't be staying at your place.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.670
- Won't be long before they look there.
- Mike's right.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.266
- Let me swing by. I'll pick him up.
- Thanks, Sam.

- Yeah.
- I appreciate it.

[ Exhales ]
Okay, so it's not a little problem.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.113
But we're not exactly talking
nosebleed seats either here, huh?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.119
Come on. Hmm?

07:02.855 --> 07:05.653
- Whoa, Mike. We got a visitor.
- [Tires Screeching]

We need to talk.

Don't I get tied to the chair?
Don't go soft on me now, Carla.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.192
I thought we'd keep this meeting
a little more casual.

07:44.263 --> 07:47.824
- We want to know howyour investigation is going.
- We? Who's "we"?

07:47.900 --> 07:52.234
- [ Loudly] Love to meet the team
ifthey're around.
- Michael, sit down.

07:52.305 --> 07:57.174
We got our analysis back
ofthe explosives atyour place--

07:57.243 --> 07:59.871
same method and materials used
on the other operatives that were attacked.

07:59.946 --> 08:04.212
"Operatives." Plural.
How many exactly? Do I get names?

08:04.283 --> 08:05.910
- [File Slides On Table ]
- No.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.885
I thought you weren't
going to tie my hands.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.855
I've seen you work.
You do just fine with your hands tied.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.858
Everything I can share with you is here.
And it stays here.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.920
Look it over.
Let us know when you're done.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.432
What if I have to go
to the little boys' room?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.470
[ Chuckles ]
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.

08:24.537 --> 08:27.836
My men have orders to shoot you
ifyou try to leave the room.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.086
Hey, Mike.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.419
Well, that was a quickie.
You look... unbruised.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.619
Just a few paper cuts.
I got a look at Carla's files.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.924
She thinks the bomber's not local.

08:50.997 --> 08:55.331
So the big bad burn notice lady's a step
behind you. You think it's gonna stay that way?

08:55.401 --> 08:59.269
I asked for a list of all demolition experts
who've spent time in Serbia and Montenegro.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.796
Said I saw a pattern there.
Yeah, we got another meeting on the books.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.571
Nice. Fi's upstairs with the kids.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.636
I'm just headin' out
to get dinner for everybody.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.273
- Pizza time?
- Yeah.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.283
Uh, Mike,just a heads up.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.842
This one has Fi a little fired up.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.784
Sorry. I was, uh, delayed.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.422
Oh, that's okay, Michael.
I was getting to knowyour guests.

09:26.966 --> 09:30.197
Hey. I'm Corey.
This is my little sister, Tanya.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.533
- Hi. I'm Michael.
- Nice to meetyou.

09:32.605 --> 09:37.338
They told me about their situation.
It seems this man-- Felix?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.338
He tookTanya for a ride in his car...

09:41.414 --> 09:43.712
andthen he attackedher.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.343
Andshe escaped, barely.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.944
And then Coreywent afterhim
with a baseball bat.

09:49.021 --> 09:52.115
I found her crying in the street. I wanted
to make sure he never tried to come back--

09:52.191 --> 09:54.625
No explanation necessary.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.720
Use a golf club next time.
Greater force to a smaller area.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.728
Uh, yeah.
But now he's after me.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.531
His guys came to my house.
They tried to shoot me in the street.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.072
- I don't know where to go.
- It's fine.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.232
- We'll take care ofit.
- Would you excuse me?

10:12.144 --> 10:14.908
Fiona, could I talkwith you
out on the balcony?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.748
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
We are helping these kids.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.383
- Fi, this is a job for the police.
- Oh, sure.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.758
Ifwe let Felix kill Corey, they'll have
more evidence when he comes after this girl again.

10:29.829 --> 10:32.354
You madeyour point.
We can get them out oftown.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.832
No. They've done nothing wrong.
They're not going anywhere.

10:35.901 --> 10:39.769
That sick son of a bitch is going somewhere,
and this is not a discussion.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.364
Fiona, you're letting your emotions
get the better ofyou.

10:42.441 --> 10:46.309
No. I'm doing better than that.
I'm letting my feelings run the show...

10:46.379 --> 10:49.075
and I feel very strongly about this.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.084
[Corey]
Felix works out ofthat club mostly.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.924

36:38.688 --> 36:41.122
Thank you. And can you thank Fiona for us?

36:41.190 --> 36:44.717
Look, ifyou get anywhere near
the Super Bowl, I want tickets, okay.

36:44.794 --> 36:48.628
- I wanna be sittin' on a goal post.
- You got it, man.

36:48.698 --> 36:50.723
[ Cell Phone Ringing]

36:52.468 --> 36:56.234
- Yeah, Fi.
- Michael, I believe I found your bomber's house.

36:56.305 --> 36:58.239
All right. I'm on myway.

36:58.307 --> 37:01.003
The bad news is, looks like
no one's lived there in a while.

37:01.077 --> 37:04.376
Mail's piled up in the box,
newspapers stacking up.

37:04.447 --> 37:07.644
I think I may go in and poke around a little
while I'm waiting.

37:07.717 --> 37:11.084
- No. I don'twant to disturb--
- You think I've never broken into a house before?

37:11.154 --> 37:12.951
Fiona,just take it easy and be careful.

[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou booby-trap someone else's place...

37:32.408 --> 37:35.104
you put the trigger in the door
orjust inside...

37:35.178 --> 37:37.840
so the odds oftripping it
are much higher.

37:41.918 --> 37:45.513
Ifyou rigyour own place,
the trigger has to be farther inside...

37:45.588 --> 37:47.579
so you can safely enter.

37:47.657 --> 37:49.784
A trip wire
is a quick and dirty version...

37:49.859 --> 37:54.319
but a contact plate under the rug
is completely undetectable.

37:55.598 --> 37:58.066
Put a little accelerant on the walls--

37:58.134 --> 38:01.535
There 's a reason they call it a firetrap.

38:07.477 --> 38:09.502
It's Fi. Leave a message.
[ Recorder Beeps ]

38:09.579 --> 38:12.070

Cal I me back ifyou get this.

38:16.619 --> 38:18.553
- Hey, hey. You can't be here.
- Was anyone in there?

38:18.621 --> 38:20.418
Did you find anyone in there?

38:20.490 --> 38:23.357
We don't know yet.
We haven't been able to confirm--

38:23.426 --> 38:25.360
- It's too hot--
- Is there a woman in there?

38:25.428 --> 38:28.727
All we know is someone was seen goin' in.
We don't know ifthey came out.

38:28.798 --> 38:30.595
Butyou didn't see a woman come out!

38:30.666 --> 38:33.032
Did anyone see anything?
Is anyone in there?

38:33.102 --> 38:35.832
- She's-- She's--
- Move back! That's enough!

38:36.806 --> 38:39.331
Move it back!
Move it back!

38:40.476 --> 38:43.036
We're clearing this whole street.
Let's go!

38:45.281 --> 38:47.340
It's Fi. Leave a message.

38:47.416 --> 38:50.214

39:26.722 --> 39:30.214
There you are.
You have got to get a landline in here.

39:31.928 --> 39:34.556
Poole rigged his place
to burst into flames.

39:34.630 --> 39:37.997
No surprise,
but I let my curiosity get away with me.

[ Keys Clatter]

39:39.869 --> 39:42.303
I waited for a burnout
in one ofthe windows...

39:42.371 --> 39:44.669
and now I need a new cell phone.

39:51.380 --> 39:54.042
Michael, you didn't think that--

40:35.925 --> 40:38.018
Breakfast? For me?

40:38.094 --> 40:41.291
I see Fiona's spending the night now.

40:42.932 --> 40:46.629
Good foryou.
Putting down roots.

40:46.702 --> 40:49.466
So, you've had your couple of days.

40:49.538 --> 40:52.632
What's the good news?

40:52.708 --> 40:54.835
I ruled out everyone
on the list you gave me.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.571
I took another look at the blast...

40:56.646 --> 40:59.843
checking demolition specialists,
uh, private contractors.

40:59.915 --> 41:03.373
You could have someone look at that list
and see ifthere's anyone worth flagging.

41:03.452 --> 41:06.910
Is this some kind ofa joke?
From what I hear, you had plenty oftime...

41:06.989 --> 41:08.923
to run around town
playing dress-up with your friends.

41:08.991 --> 41:11.585
But the bestyou can do for me
is a needle in a haystack?

41:11.661 --> 41:13.891
Ifyou have a better idea,
I'm willing to hear it.

41:13.963 --> 41:16.989
You're my idea, Michael.
Make no mistake.

41:17.066 --> 41:19.534
There are those who think
you're more trouble than you're worth.

41:19.602 --> 41:23.470
I've convinced them thatyou're useful
'causeyou can find the bomber.

41:23.539 --> 41:26.030
What doyou think's gonna happen toyou
ifyou don't deliver?

41:26.108 --> 41:28.269
Same thing that would
happen toyou, I suppose.

41:32.014 --> 41:34.574
You gonna run that check for me?

41:34.650 --> 41:37.346
Give me the list.

41:37.420 --> 41:41.015
Michael, it's timeyou focus
on helping yourself...

41:41.090 --> 41:43.581

to help anyone else.
