00:10.644 --> 00:13.247
( ethereal techno pop music
playing )

00:15.349 --> 00:18.786
* Slip through his fingers,
melt away *

00:18.819 --> 00:21.255
* Make me melt

00:21.289 --> 00:23.191
* Away...

00:23.224 --> 00:24.692
( typing )

00:28.729 --> 00:30.564
( computer beeping )

00:37.138 --> 00:41.442
* Follow, follow to lead...

00:47.315 --> 00:48.649
Hello?

00:56.724 --> 00:57.491
( clank )

00:58.726 --> 01:00.661
Is anyone there?

01:00.694 --> 01:02.796
( clattering )

01:14.408 --> 01:16.210
( screaming )

01:18.546 --> 01:21.415
Technically, this museum
sits on Federal land.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.717
99-year lease.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.686
Figured we'd call you.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.258
DON:
You got I.D.?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.425
Jennifer Abernathy.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.494
She was one of
the researchers here.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.795
DON:
What do you say, Megan?

01:34.828 --> 01:38.332
The only trauma I can see
is the head wound.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.434
DON: See, this has got blood,
right here.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.136
She's missing a shoe.

01:42.170 --> 01:45.273
What do you think,
being chased?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.574
Yeah.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.142
Who found her?

01:48.176 --> 01:49.543
The night watchman.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.544
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.280
I'm Don Eppes
with the FBI.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.215
Frank Lopez.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.283
Frank.
What can you tell me?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.817
I was just doing my rounds.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.352
Things seemed pretty routine
till I got down here.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.620
Found her like that.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.289
You hear anything?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.491
Nah, it's the graveyard shift.
Just me for the whole place.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.426
I didn't even know
she was working last night.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.295
Was there
anybody else here?

02:07.328 --> 02:08.562
Well, there's a security sweep
after we close.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.630
Cleaning crew comes in.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.465
They usually knock off
about 11:00.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.501
After that, it's just me.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.868
If it's okay with you,

02:14.902 --> 02:16.069
we'd like you to go with one of
our deputies,

02:16.103 --> 02:18.372
see if we can get you changed
into some street clothes?

02:18.406 --> 02:20.741
-You want my uniform?
-Yeah. Is that okay?

02:20.774 --> 02:22.810
-Sure.
-Thanks.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.414
Building is locked
down after hours.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.715
No sign of
a forced entry.

02:27.748 --> 02:28.582
Security cameras?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.185
Front door, lobby
and loading dock.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.186
So far, there's nothing.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.521
That doesn't make
any sense.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.190
There's money, credit cards,
I.D.-- it's all here.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.458
Well, probably not
a robbery, then.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.260
So, someone was after her.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.595
Or something.
Right?

02:41.629 --> 02:42.663
She gets in the way.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.931
REEVES:
Yeah.

02:43.964 --> 02:44.932
Check this out.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.668
Some kind of calculations.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.470
Yeah, the deputy
said she did research.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.905
Last entry's today.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.374
"Last entry" is right.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.513
We all use math every day,

02:59.547 --> 03:01.382
to predict weather,

03:01.415 --> 03:04.285
to tell time,

03:04.318 --> 03:07.488
to handle money.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.759
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:11.792 --> 03:17.231
It's logic... rationality.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.832
It's using your mind

03:18.866 --> 03:20.834
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.944
CHARLIE:
I am officially RSVP'ing

03:30.978 --> 03:32.746
for myself and one Alan Eppes,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.683
who said he'd be delighted
to come to your dinner party.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.285
It's been awhile
since I entertained.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.420
I hope my hosting
skills haven't atrophied.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.754
Although "atrophy" implies

03:40.788 --> 03:42.556
a certain level of strength
to begin with.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.658
Hey, boys, how we doing?

03:44.692 --> 03:45.893
-Hi.
-What's for breakfast?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.561
Toast and tori.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.430
Tori-- What do you mean?
That looks like Cheerios.

03:49.463 --> 03:53.734
"Tori," plural of "torus"--
a shape with a hole in it.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.903
Well, topologically speaking.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.004
Mind if I have
a rectangle?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.039
Uh... help yourself.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.375
My math abilities
might be a biological

04:01.409 --> 04:02.710
adaptation,
because from an early age,

04:02.743 --> 04:04.578
I've been deprived
the nutrition

04:04.612 --> 04:07.014
necessary to become
a professional athlete.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.015
They say, you know,
people who eat

04:08.048 --> 04:09.383
a low-calorie diet live longer.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.518
-Is that what they say?
-They do say that.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.752
Hey, I'm looking out
for you, bro.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.654
In exchange for what?

04:13.687 --> 04:16.056
Yeah... um...

04:16.089 --> 04:17.758
This woman who works for
the Heritage Museum

04:17.791 --> 04:19.593
was killed last night.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.894
We found this on her,
but the thing is

04:20.928 --> 04:22.062
we can't make heads
or tails of it,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.464
so, thought maybe
you could.

04:23.497 --> 04:27.000
Hmm.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.337
LARRY: I can already tell you
what those are.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.506
Equations related to
quantitative archaeology.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.507
Yeah?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.475
Archaeology is just
another form

04:34.508 --> 04:37.345
of detection-- the artifacts
are the clues,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.480
and the history they reveal
is the solution.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.881
And this is
carbon dating.

04:40.914 --> 04:41.949
These are formulas for

04:41.982 --> 04:43.817
calculating the age
of an object.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.620
I consulted on a paleontology
project once.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.522
Carbon dating uses
radiation, right?

04:48.556 --> 04:49.657
CHARLIE:
All living things

04:49.690 --> 04:52.025
absorb radioactive
carbon 14

04:52.059 --> 04:54.428
into their bodies--
plants through photosynthesis

04:54.462 --> 04:55.796
animals from the food chain.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.898
But, like any radioactive
material,

04:57.931 --> 05:00.033
the atoms decay
at a steady rate,

05:00.067 --> 05:04.538
only replenished if
the organism's alive.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.707
You know how some refrigerators
come with built-in ice-makers--

05:06.740 --> 05:09.643
so let's say the ice-maker's
programmed to keep

05:09.677 --> 05:11.379
50 ice cubes in it
at one time,

05:11.412 --> 05:14.382
but we use five ice cubes
per day.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.016
Now, as long as that
refrigerator's connected

05:16.049 --> 05:18.118
to the water supply,
it'll create new cubes

05:18.151 --> 05:19.820
to make up for the ones
we'd lost,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.955
keeping the total at 50.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.425
Death is like cutting off
the water supply.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.693
No more ice cubes
get made.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.728
So, by subtracting the number

05:27.761 --> 05:29.530
of ice cubes we have left--

05:29.563 --> 05:31.064
let's say, like,
uh, 35--

05:31.098 --> 05:33.401
from the total original number
of 50,

05:33.434 --> 05:35.803
and then dividing by
five ice cubes per day...

05:35.836 --> 05:38.572
The ice-maker's been dead
for three days?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.808
The ice-maker's a more linear
example--

05:40.841 --> 05:43.377
and radio carbon decay
is exponential--

05:43.411 --> 05:44.678
but you get the idea?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.146
Yeah, she was trying
to date something.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.147
But that's the thing:
we don't know what.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.116
It's not in her office,
it's not in her lab, so,

05:49.149 --> 05:50.150
I mean,
that's the problem,

05:50.183 --> 05:52.453
whatever it is,
is gone.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.555
Have you asked
the victim's co-workers?

05:54.588 --> 05:55.989
If whatever she was working on
got her killed,

05:56.023 --> 05:57.157
then those co-workers
are potential suspects.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.225
Right.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.961
Well, I should... I should be
able to figure out

06:00.994 --> 06:02.696
at least the parameters

06:02.730 --> 06:04.465
of the research
detail here.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.099
All right.
Why don't you hold onto it,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.569
but take care of it--
it's my only copy, all right?

06:08.602 --> 06:10.638
Don, I'm having some people
over this week, if you wanna...

06:10.671 --> 06:12.873
Oh, yeah?
What's the occasion?

06:12.906 --> 06:16.009
I've sold my house and I wanna
kind of say good-bye to it.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.745
This dinner have
a color scheme?

06:17.778 --> 06:21.449
Look, my predilection for white
food is not pathological--

06:21.482 --> 06:22.983
or at least
not just yet.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.752
The, uh, menu
will manifest

06:24.785 --> 06:27.988
all the colors of
the spectrum, yes.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.022
Well, the visible
spectrum.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.524
All right, well,
consider me there.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.859
-You'll call me?
-Yeah.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.732
She broke her neck.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.702
No compression marks on
the skin, so I'm assuming

06:41.735 --> 06:44.438
the injury resulted
from the fall.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.439
You think it...

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
was an accident?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.108
Depends what you
mean by an accident.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.212
I found defensive bruises
on her forearms and her wrists.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.882
Now, whether that person
intended her fall,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.551
that would be purely
speculation.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.490
What about
sexual assault?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.992
No vaginal tearing
or irritation,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.561
but she did have intercourse
earlier in the day.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.762
Most likely was consensual.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.464
What makes you say that?

07:10.498 --> 07:13.934
I found trace evidence
of a spermicidal gel.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.804
WOMAN:
Jennifer had access

07:16.837 --> 07:19.172
to all of our facilities
at one time or another.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.909
Mm-hmm. And this is the only lab
with carbon-dating equipment?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.778
Yes, that's right, but I think
it would be fairly odd

07:24.812 --> 07:27.047
for Jennifer to be down
here by this time, though.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.582
Oh? Why's that?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.951
Well, we have technicians
who operate the machine.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.854
The procedure would be for
Jennifer to inventory an item

07:33.887 --> 07:36.056
and then let the technicians
do the testing.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.190
And she didn't do that?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.926
Not that I'm aware of.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.530
I also would've been notified if
any item needed carbon dating.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.865
Is there any way to tell when
the machines were used last?

07:44.898 --> 07:47.167
Yes, there's a computer readout.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.673
WOMAN:
1:34 a.m.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.809
That's right around the time
she was killed.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.246
We don't have any technicians
working at that hour.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.784
( weary sigh )

08:04.918 --> 08:07.120
( groaning ):
Okay...

08:11.091 --> 08:12.826
ALAN:
Hey, Charlie?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.695
I thought you were
at work.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.129
Wh-Wh-What you
doing back here?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.598
Just looking for something.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.132
-Oh, yeah? What?
-Yeah.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.935
Um... a book on Native American
artifacts

08:21.969 --> 08:23.571
that I remember
you used to have.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.838
'Cause you used to find
old things

08:24.872 --> 08:26.106
when you worked for the city.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You dig a foundation

08:27.741 --> 08:30.043
for a new building, you come up
with all kinds of stuff.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.746
And I liked to look up
what they actually were.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.247
Hmm.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.716
What do you need it for?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.751
I'm just trying to get an idea
of the math

08:37.785 --> 08:39.887
used by archaeologists,
and I remember you had a book

08:39.920 --> 08:41.121
that said something
about that, so...

08:41.154 --> 08:42.890
Yeah, yeah.
They're in the boxes...

08:42.923 --> 08:44.291
Actually,
I already found it.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.726
I found it already.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.860
What are you doing?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.036
-Dad... uh...
-What?

08:56.069 --> 08:58.305
I thought you gave all of
Mom's clothes to charity.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.007
I said I was
going to; I will.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.675
Don helped you
box this stuff up,

09:01.709 --> 09:04.211
like... six months ago.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.614
You know, hard as it may seem
for you to believe,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.982
a man of my age
does have a life.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.150
I was busy.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.152
Dad... you're dating again.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.887
I mean,
what if you meet someone

09:13.921 --> 09:15.889
and she finds out that you're
still hanging on...

09:15.923 --> 09:17.791
I would tell her it's none
of her business.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.993
Which is exactly what I'm
telling you right now.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.900
REEVES: So she rented from you
for about a year?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.035
Lovely girl.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.137
So smart. Well-spoken.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.772
How awful for her family.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.306
You say she was pretty quiet.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.942
Except in the shower.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.110
In the shower?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.779
You could hear her singing
all the way

09:38.812 --> 09:40.113
down the hall--
she had many gifts,

09:40.147 --> 09:41.815
but a voice wasn't
one of them.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.686
Her specialty was Native
American antiquities.

09:45.719 --> 09:50.257
Unopened mail,
dry cleaning still in the bag...

09:50.290 --> 09:51.124
She spent all her time
at the museum.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.094
I told her: slow down,
smell the roses,

09:54.127 --> 09:56.664
but young people...

09:56.697 --> 09:58.832
Maybe she had a reason
to sing in the shower?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.668
Mm.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.336
So, did Jennifer have
a boyfriend?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.839
Well, I'm not one of those
nosy landladies,

10:05.873 --> 10:09.009
but her boss sometimes
dropped her off at night.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.343
Her boss.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.080
Her married boss.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.749
Oh.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.951
DON: The museum director told me
it was unusual

10:17.985 --> 10:19.419
for her to be using
the equipment,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.989
and she wasn't notified
that anything needed testing.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.957
So she's in there
alone, at night,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.826
testing something
nobody knew about.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.360
Thanks. Well, look,
someone knew something.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.229
I mean, she was
murdered, right?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.798
The landlady told me
she might've been

10:30.831 --> 10:33.701
seeing her boss on a less-
than-professional basis.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.068
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's find out

10:35.102 --> 10:36.236
where he was that night.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.438
I can tell you where
he was supposed to be.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.240
With his wife.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.911
Kenneth Hill?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.012
Yes.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.180
I'm Agent Reeves;
Sinclair.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.717
You the ones who
called about Jennifer?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.818
( sighs)

10:50.851 --> 10:52.119
It's a terrible thing.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.854
How well did
you know her?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.255
I was her boss.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.091
How about other than
as her boss?

10:59.426 --> 11:01.294
I'm not sure exactly
what you mean.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.997
You know we're not interested
in messing up your marriage

11:04.031 --> 11:06.266
any more than you already
have, Dr. Hill,

11:06.299 --> 11:08.068
but a woman's life has
been taken here.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.371
We had a relationship.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.107
But, um... I had nothing to do
with what happened to her.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.142
I was home.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.344
-You can ask...
-Your wife?

11:17.377 --> 11:20.080
I'd prefer
that you not do that.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.448
Oh, I'm sure that you would,

11:21.481 --> 11:24.952
but at this point
that really can't be avoided.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.821
Unless, of course,
you were willing to cooperate,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.790
and then we probably wouldn't
have to reveal

11:29.823 --> 11:33.360
the full extent of your
relationship with Jennifer.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.462
Fine.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.297
What was she doing there
that time of night?

11:37.330 --> 11:42.102
On occasion, we get asked
to date a private piece.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.171
Private piece?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
Something that's dug up
in a field locally.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.440
Okay, but why at that hour?

11:47.474 --> 11:48.976
Because certain parties
sometimes lay claim

11:49.009 --> 11:50.043
to these finds.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.344
Native Americans, for example,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.913
will often exercise
tribal claims.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.182
And they can only do that
if they know about it?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.350
These finds are sometimes
reburied

11:57.384 --> 11:59.186
without allowing
for any testing at all.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.353
Why?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.488
The existence of something
older than the tribe itself

12:01.521 --> 12:03.857
would bring into question
the validity of their claims--

12:03.891 --> 12:07.394
to the land, to being the first
inhabitants to begin with.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.395
So what was Jennifer testing?

12:08.428 --> 12:12.199
I wish I knew.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.303
I just remembered, when
I was in Albuquerque,

12:16.336 --> 12:19.472
we busted a guy for robbing
tribal burial grounds.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.274
Yeah, the law passed in 1990.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.876
Any artifacts have
to be returned

12:22.910 --> 12:24.144
to whatever tribe
they came from.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.545
The museum director
said she didn't think

12:25.578 --> 12:27.480
they had anything
that needed testing.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.218
That's because what your victim
was carbon dating wasn't part

12:31.251 --> 12:32.252
of the museum's
collection.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.486
It was a new find.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.888
A new find?

12:34.922 --> 12:38.091
A very old new find.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.494
I analyzed Jennifer Abernathy's
calculations,

12:41.528 --> 12:42.963
and it's clear

12:42.996 --> 12:43.997
whatever she was
describing

12:44.031 --> 12:46.133
had to be extremely old.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.135
I don't think she wanted

12:48.168 --> 12:49.803
anyone to know
what she was testing.

12:49.837 --> 12:50.838
Why not?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.840
I assumed that these numbers
were measurements,

12:52.873 --> 12:54.274
so I ran them against
a program

12:54.307 --> 12:56.109
used by forensic
anthropologists

12:56.143 --> 12:59.246
called FORDISC to see if they
matched anything human.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.914
Well, they did.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.318
DON:
Yeah, it's a skull, huh?

13:08.021 --> 13:11.258
A 10,000-year-old human skull.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.126
Did you say 10,000 years?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.128
CHARLIE:
What your victim was testing

13:15.162 --> 13:17.130
were fragments of a skull
that would make it

13:17.164 --> 13:20.400
the oldest human remains
ever found in this area.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.269
MEGAN: And from what Hill
just told me,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.104
that would be enough
of a reason to kill.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.216
Thank you for seeing me,
Chief Clearwater.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.885
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.087
This is my attorney,
Thomas Morris.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.621
Your attorney?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.356
History's taught us
to exercise caution

13:43.390 --> 13:45.025
when dealing with
the federal government.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.560
-( chuckles )
-And an MBA has taught me

13:47.594 --> 13:49.529
the value
of expert counsel.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.431
How can we help you?

13:51.464 --> 13:53.333
A woman was murdered
the other night

13:53.366 --> 13:56.136
at the Heritage Museum.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.438
I'm very sorry
to hear about that.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.640
Please.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.610
At the time of her death,
she was in the possession

14:03.643 --> 14:07.047
of a significant
archeological find--

14:07.080 --> 14:08.548
a Native-American find.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.183
I understand that
in the past

14:10.217 --> 14:11.919
you've exercised
similar claims

14:11.952 --> 14:13.921
to items like this?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.289
If your great-grandmother's
possessions were dug up,

14:16.323 --> 14:17.991
would you want them back?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.128
Yes, I would.
That's why I'm here.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.162
Are you seriously
accusing us...?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.196
You didn't let me finish.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.564
I also understand

14:24.597 --> 14:26.266
that these artifacts
can be worth

14:26.299 --> 14:29.402
a lot of money
on the black market.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.540
Unfortunately, there are those
who don't respect the sanctity

14:33.573 --> 14:34.574
of our burial grounds.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.009
And you've bought

14:36.043 --> 14:37.644
some of these items
from the black market

14:37.677 --> 14:39.046
in the past, correct?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.648
And your casino money
allows you to do that.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.452
If the authorities
were more aggressive

14:45.485 --> 14:46.686
in prosecuting
these grave robbers,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.321
we wouldn't need to.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.123
If you could just give me
their names,

14:50.157 --> 14:51.558
then I can follow up
in this case...

14:51.591 --> 14:53.560
We are a sovereign nation.
You can't compel us...

14:53.593 --> 14:55.162
I'm not compelling you
to do anything.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.196
I'm asking.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.565
I think that's what

14:58.598 --> 15:00.667
my great-grandmother
would have wanted.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.450
If you throw one of those near
me, you're a dead man.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.453
I have better aim
than that.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.521
What's the matter?

15:21.554 --> 15:24.257
Keppler got the flu,
and I had to teach his class

15:24.291 --> 15:28.095
on the structure
and dynamic of galaxies.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.597
His lecture notes are a mess.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.032
Keppler's a little
disorganized, huh?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.569
Hey, I'm organized.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.570
Enough.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.106
( derisive chuckle )

15:40.607 --> 15:43.176
Have you seen
your office lately?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.112
There's a symmetry
to my chaos, okay?

15:45.145 --> 15:48.515
My system is chronological
by height.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.483
A pretty poetic description
of clutter.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.086
It's more than just clutter,
though.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.325
There exists this need
to hold on, to...

15:58.358 --> 15:59.626
to things.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.196
Are we talking about
the skull, Charlie?

16:03.230 --> 16:06.199
My dad has my mother's
personal belongings

16:06.233 --> 16:07.767
packed in the garage,

16:07.800 --> 16:10.503
and he was supposed
to have given them away.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.106
Sounds like he's not ready
to let her go yet.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.509
He seemed to be handling
your mother's death pretty well.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.246
I think that's what he'd like
us to think,

16:19.279 --> 16:20.613
but it's clearly not true.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.683
Did you talk to him about it?

16:23.716 --> 16:24.684
If you can believe it,

16:24.717 --> 16:27.120
he told me to mind my own
business.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.355
LARRY:
Your father--

16:28.388 --> 16:30.790
he came from this generation
where the heads of households

16:30.823 --> 16:32.392
are supposed to show strength.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.526
Don't dare show weakness.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.129
He's just not going
to come to you

16:36.163 --> 16:37.230
for help.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.498
Even if he needs it.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.068
Charlie, you need
to talk to Don.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.336
This involves
your whole family.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.774
That's the kill hole--

16:47.807 --> 16:49.809
to release
the dead person's spirit.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.311
And where would you get

16:51.344 --> 16:53.046
something like that?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.515
I mean, it looks like
it's from a burial site.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.450
All my items come
with provenance

16:57.484 --> 16:59.286
showing that they were found
on private land--

16:59.319 --> 17:01.721
all perfectly legal.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.156
How does that work exactly?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.258
I mean, you pretty much have
to take the word

17:05.292 --> 17:07.160
of the person who
brings it in, don't you?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.195
I'm sorry,

17:08.228 --> 17:09.529
but what's your interest here?

17:09.562 --> 17:11.131
Oh, um...

17:14.367 --> 17:16.703
I have documentation
for everything in the store.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.507
Really? Because we heard
that you would sell items

17:20.540 --> 17:22.442
without documentation.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.312
Items to the Wiyana nation,
for example.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.315
Maybe I should speak
to a lawyer.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.318
Maybe we should put you
in a position where you need

17:31.351 --> 17:32.719
to talk to a lawyer.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.720
A skull was stolen.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.455
10,000 years old.

17:35.488 --> 17:39.392
Maybe you heard about something
like that being up for sale.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.662
I'm sure I haven't.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.364
There are people
that you could call.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.200
A woman's been murdered.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.435
We want their names.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.203
Lawyers cost about

17:50.237 --> 17:51.404
$200 an hour.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.206
Goodwill would cost you
a lot less.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.477
Well, my lawyer charges
$300.

18:02.382 --> 18:06.153
10,000 year old human skull
found on the Pacific coast

18:06.186 --> 18:08.888
with these dimensions.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.657
Pretty big find, right?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.759
Assuming it's not a hoax,

18:12.792 --> 18:15.128
and assuming it was
a local find.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.629
What do you mean by that?

18:16.663 --> 18:18.331
Well, it's obvious your victim
was working

18:18.365 --> 18:20.233
with regression equations...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.802
maxillary sinus volume,
high cheek bone placement...

18:22.835 --> 18:25.505
These are measurements we use
to estimate ancestry.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.606
Like race?

18:26.639 --> 18:27.674
Not exactly.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.309
Race is a cultural construct.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.511
Scientifically
speaking,

18:31.544 --> 18:32.845
ancestry is more about
geography.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.381
For example-- the mid-face areas

18:34.414 --> 18:38.518
show variations in structure
that result from

18:38.551 --> 18:40.920
adaptation to cold, aridity--

18:40.953 --> 18:42.722
allowing us to classify
the skull.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.723
As...?

18:43.756 --> 18:44.724
As being

18:44.757 --> 18:46.326
of European origin,

18:46.359 --> 18:47.927
African origin, Asian origin.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.596
What does
that one tell you?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.164
I've entered the data

18:51.198 --> 18:53.600
into a program
that reconstructs

18:53.633 --> 18:56.369
what this individual
might have looked like.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.546
DON:
That's funny, he doesn't look

19:06.579 --> 19:08.248
Native American to me.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.749
For good reason.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.951
Native Americans fall under
the Asian classification.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.687
But this skull has
characteristics

19:14.721 --> 19:16.689
we associate
with European origin.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.292
I see that.
He looks European, right?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.493
Who, apparently,
was in California

19:20.527 --> 19:21.594
about a thousand years

19:21.628 --> 19:23.496
before the Wiyanas'
creation stories

19:23.530 --> 19:25.665
claim he should have been.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.203
MEGAN:
So you're saying this skull

19:30.237 --> 19:31.338
wasn't Native American?

19:31.371 --> 19:32.639
No, I'm saying
it's a possibility.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.706
So what was he?

19:33.740 --> 19:34.707
Well, the anthropologist

19:34.741 --> 19:35.708
thinks European.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.310
He was a white guy?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.978
No, it's more
of a geographic thing.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.947
Apparently, race isn't
really a factor.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.715
They need to circulate
that memo.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.717
I ran that list
of names we got from

19:44.751 --> 19:45.718
that antiquities dealer.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.354
Guess whose name
is on the list.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.655
Dr. Ken Hill.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.989
Jennifer's boyfriend.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.524
DAVID:
Apparently, Dr. Hill

19:51.558 --> 19:52.692
has supplied these type
of artifacts

19:52.725 --> 19:53.860
through this dealer
in the past.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.563
So his interest wasn't
purely scientific.

20:06.639 --> 20:10.377
When you told me Jennifer might
have been testing a new find

20:10.410 --> 20:12.612
the night she was murdered,
you failed to tell me

20:12.645 --> 20:14.447
that you were the
one who found it.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.882
And I know
it was a skull,

20:15.915 --> 20:17.317
and I know how old it is.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.387
Look, a construction crew
found it

20:20.420 --> 20:21.588
digging a foundation
for a school.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.989
I was called in
to examine it.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.725
I knew right away what it was.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.727
So you just took it?

20:29.596 --> 20:32.265
It was the find
of a lifetime.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.733
And they'd already
made a decision

20:33.766 --> 20:35.402
to turn it over
to the Wiyanas.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.537
That is a federal law,
Dr. Hill.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.606
Those bones belong
to the local tribes.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.308
Without testing,
without proof,

20:41.341 --> 20:44.277
it is just political correctness
without regard to science.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.614
So then you just gave it
to Jennifer to do the test?

20:47.647 --> 20:50.683
I never thought
she was in danger.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.686
We were just trying to preserve
a scientific record.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.787
I could have you arrested

20:54.821 --> 20:57.023
for taking that skull.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.827
I've lost everything,
Agent Reeves.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.562
My wife...

21:02.595 --> 21:05.765
my reputation...

21:05.798 --> 21:06.733
even Jennifer.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.703
So what you do to me
doesn't matter anymore.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.838
But the real
irony is,

21:11.871 --> 21:14.307
without the skull,

21:14.341 --> 21:16.609
neither one of us
has any evidence.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.486
Hey. Hey, you know, that skull
might actually be European.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.720
Really?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.021
Yeah.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.557
What are you
doing here?

21:30.590 --> 21:31.991
You got something?

21:32.024 --> 21:35.562
I just wanted to talk
to you about...

21:35.595 --> 21:37.764
( sighs )

21:37.797 --> 21:39.699
You know what,
it's so not...

21:39.732 --> 21:41.033
it's not even... whatever.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.402
It's not, it's not...

21:42.435 --> 21:43.870
Wait, hold on.
What's going on?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.839
Mom's stuff.

21:46.873 --> 21:47.840
What?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.776
You came over, you helped
Dad box Mom's stuff.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.843
Everything.

21:50.877 --> 21:51.878
Yeah.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.980
That's six months ago.
He gave it all away, right?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.081
He didn't give it away.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.483
He kept it.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.650
I found everything.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.552
It was all
hidden away in the garage.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.754
-Hidden?
-Yeah.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.556
He clearly didn't
want me to see

22:03.590 --> 22:05.825
he still had it all.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.093
You say anything?

22:07.126 --> 22:08.528
He was very defensive.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.064
All right, I'll talk to him.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.132
I-I already tried.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.835
Yeah, well, I get paid
to make people talk, you know?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.770
Yeah, but how many of
your suspects grounded you

22:17.804 --> 22:18.971
for breaking the
neighbor's window?

22:19.005 --> 22:19.972
Never proven.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.474
I'll take care of it.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.843
Hey, guys, Hill said
there was a court case.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.845
Wait a minute.
What kind?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.013
Between him
and the Wiyanas

22:27.046 --> 22:29.916
over the bones found at the
school construction site.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.584
Hill lost,
upshot being

22:31.618 --> 22:34.387
he would never get the test
to carbon date the remains.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.656
-So he stole the skull.
-Without testing, how could

22:36.689 --> 22:38.157
anyone have any idea
of what they'd found?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.158
Well, according
to Hill,

22:39.191 --> 22:40.827
this is the whole point.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.596
If the Wiyanas aren't the
regions original residents,

22:43.630 --> 22:44.997
it opens them up
to a challenge

22:45.031 --> 22:46.399
on the land-use rights...

22:46.433 --> 22:47.500
Gaming interests.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.601
This skull

22:48.635 --> 22:49.702
could destroy
the tribe.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.144
Who wants dessert?

22:58.177 --> 23:00.146
CHARLIE:
I do, I do.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.849
Oh, wow. What,
what is that?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.050
Liquid nitrogen.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.420
Plus milk.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.721
Cream...

23:09.956 --> 23:11.924
Sugar... and a little...

23:11.958 --> 23:13.192
vanilla.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.794
ANITA:
It's a fast

23:14.827 --> 23:16.195
and simple way to
make ice cream.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.630
Oh, ice cream.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.766
DON: I knew it would be
interesting, but this

23:19.799 --> 23:20.767
is definitely out there.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.034
ALAN:
That looks prehistoric.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.402
Yeah.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.905
Well, let me
understand something

23:25.938 --> 23:27.507
about this Indian
artifacts case of yours.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.575
I mean about the skull.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.776
-Yeah.
-Do you really think

23:29.809 --> 23:30.977
that it was taken

23:31.010 --> 23:32.111
to preserve land rights?

23:32.144 --> 23:34.881
Yeah. Well, I mean, you know,
it's a working theory.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.783
They had to be pretty
desperate to kill someone.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.184
What do you mean?
People have killed

23:38.217 --> 23:39.919
for a lot less than
that, you know?

23:39.952 --> 23:42.188
I mean, it's a
billion-dollar gaming industry.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.790
LARRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but it sure

23:43.823 --> 23:46.459
seems like there's more
than money at stake here.

23:46.493 --> 23:49.729
I mean, the age
of that skull flies in the face

23:49.762 --> 23:52.565
of the Wiyanas' notion
of creation.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.800
Uh-oh. Science versus religion.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.801
That could get ugly.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.236
Well, certainly science
doesn't require religion

23:57.269 --> 23:59.572
to change its basic concepts,

23:59.606 --> 24:02.008
just to reconsider
the mechanisms involved.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.011
Yes, yes, but sometimes the
mechanisms are just the point.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.179
I mean, Galileo spent
the last years of his life

24:07.213 --> 24:09.782
under house arrest
because he declared that the sun

24:09.816 --> 24:11.484
does not revolve
around the earth.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.720
DON: Yeah, but look,
hey, for certain people

24:13.753 --> 24:14.921
religion is just that, you know.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.589
I mean, by definition,
it is unconditional

24:16.623 --> 24:18.891
so it doesn't matter
what science says.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.961
Though many famous scientists,
like Einstein, believed in God.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.996
All right, you know,
since I was taught

24:24.030 --> 24:26.265
never to talk about religion
over the dinner table,

24:26.298 --> 24:28.100
I would just like to
take this opportunity

24:28.134 --> 24:30.837
to express my appreciation
for this fine meal...

24:30.870 --> 24:31.904
by doing the dishes.

24:31.938 --> 24:32.839
No, no, no, please.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.274
-Come on, that's not necessary.
-Nonsense.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.676
Yeah. Actually,
I'll give you a hand.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.146
You're gonna help
with the dishes?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.648
Sure. Why not?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.016
We should eat at someone
else's house more often.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.151
Hand me that bread plate.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.855
AMITA:
So, Larry,

24:48.888 --> 24:50.156
when you move...

24:50.189 --> 24:52.258
what are you going to do
with all this stuff?

24:52.291 --> 24:53.593
I don't know.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.027
Hey, would you two

24:55.061 --> 24:57.263
like to take home your dishware?

24:59.632 --> 25:01.133
ALAN:
You want to scrape or wash?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.569
Uh... well, I think I'll wash.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.270
You know, Mom used
to get me to scrape

25:04.303 --> 25:05.271
and then she'd say,

25:05.304 --> 25:07.039
"While, you have the plate in
your hand..."

25:09.909 --> 25:11.611
This is your subtle way
of telling me

25:11.644 --> 25:13.780
that Charlie talked to you
about the boxes?

25:13.813 --> 25:16.082
He was a little concerned,
that's all.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.618
Yeah. And you're not?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.987
Dad, hey, I don't care
about the boxes, but

25:21.020 --> 25:22.789
you know, the way
he said you reacted

25:22.822 --> 25:24.123
He was prying
into something

25:24.156 --> 25:25.858
that he had no business
being involved in.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.027
Well, come on. I mean,
she's our mother.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.796
And my wife.
Look, what

25:29.829 --> 25:32.298
I want to do with her things,
well, that's my business.

25:32.331 --> 25:35.234
-Of course it is, but then,
why hide it? -I wasn't.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.936
I don't have to hide anything.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.905
Exactly. You don't,
so I just think

25:38.938 --> 25:41.641
you know, I mean,
it would be healthier if...

25:41.674 --> 25:44.310
Oh-ho. Look who's lecturing me
about emotional health.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.178
Wait. Hold, hold on. Wha...?

25:46.212 --> 25:47.213
I don't understand. What's up?

25:47.246 --> 25:48.547
What's up?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.050
If you think I'm gonna listen
to my two unmarried sons

25:51.083 --> 25:53.653
lecture me on how to deal
with the loss of my wife,

25:53.686 --> 25:55.554
well, that's as
ridiculous as it sounds.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.194
So much for those superior

26:02.228 --> 26:03.195
people skills, huh?

26:07.800 --> 26:08.901
MEGAN:
You failed to mention

26:08.935 --> 26:11.337
the fact that you were
in a court battle with Ken Hill

26:11.370 --> 26:13.606
over the bones found
at the school construction site.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.208
We had no way
of knowing it was relevant.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.044
Really? Even after
I mentioned the skull.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.746
CLEARWATER:
Are you implying

26:19.779 --> 26:21.948
that one of my people killed
this woman for a skull?

26:21.981 --> 26:23.282
All we had to do

26:23.315 --> 26:25.217
is pick up the phone
and call the police.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.687
Mr. Clearwater's right.
Under the law,

26:27.720 --> 26:28.988
those remains
belong to us.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.823
Unless, of course,

26:30.857 --> 26:32.391
a carbon-dating
test proved otherwise.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.726
How could they prove otherwise?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.027
What Thomas means

26:35.061 --> 26:36.262
is that

26:36.295 --> 26:38.264
the Great Spirit gave
our people this land

26:38.297 --> 26:39.498
at the beginning of time.

26:39.531 --> 26:42.702
Any remains would have to be
the remains of our ancestors.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.671
With all due respect,
I'm not that interested

26:44.704 --> 26:46.038
in a historical debate.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.374
What I am
interested in

26:48.407 --> 26:50.142
is who killed
Jennifer Abernathy.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.744
-( phone buzzing )
-Then I think you should

26:51.778 --> 26:52.879
consider motive.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.115
If Dr. Hill removed the skull
from that site illegally,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.250
any results
would be legally invalid.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.052
-Clearwater.
-Legal or not,

27:00.086 --> 27:02.655
if those results were
made public, they could cause

27:02.689 --> 27:04.123
a great deal of
trouble for you.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.157
When?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.760
I'm leaving now.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.762
There's been a break-in
at my home.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.751
Mrs. Clearwater
surprised the intruder.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.319
Apparently he hit
him in the head

27:33.352 --> 27:34.721
with the butt
of a gun.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.055
Did she get
a look at him?

27:36.088 --> 27:37.056
Yeah, it was Hill.

27:37.089 --> 27:37.957
-Hill?
-According to the wife,

27:37.990 --> 27:40.159
he went straight for
the tribal records.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.894
What is he looking for?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.029
I don't know.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.431
Megan.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.266
You understand now
what we've been dealing with?

27:47.299 --> 27:49.001
While you accuse
us of murder,

27:49.035 --> 27:50.903
this man's allowed to attack
Chief Clearwater's wife?

27:50.937 --> 27:52.304
We're going to find him. We are.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.973
Let them do their
jobs, Thomas.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.775
This man's obsessed

27:55.808 --> 27:57.910
with destroying us,
do you understand?

27:57.944 --> 27:59.045
Either you find him,

27:59.078 --> 28:00.379
or we will.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.858
Sheriff's Department says Hill's

28:11.891 --> 28:13.860
the registered owner
of a Colt .38

28:13.893 --> 28:15.361
and a Remington hunting rifle.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.496
All right, so he's armed
and he's in the wind.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.800
But heading where
and looking for what?

28:20.833 --> 28:23.335
Maybe his alibi wasn't
as legit as we thought.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.504
Hill staked everything
on those bones, right?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.373
His career, his reputation,

28:27.406 --> 28:28.741
the life of his lover.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.743
And he lost all three.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.078
So he goes back
to Clearwater's house

28:32.111 --> 28:34.146
to find the skull?
I mean, what are the odds

28:34.180 --> 28:35.782
that he's actually
gonna find it there?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.984
Well, maybe he's looking
for something else.

28:38.017 --> 28:41.453
What exactly did Mrs. Clearwater
tell the police was missing?

28:41.487 --> 28:44.791
Tribal records, histories, maps,

28:44.824 --> 28:45.992
population studies.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.027
He's looking for the skull
somewhere else.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.196
Yeah, or whoever took it.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.832
These calculations that
we got from Hill's office

28:52.865 --> 28:55.301
and a list of references
that were stolen

28:55.334 --> 28:56.435
from Clearwater's house,

28:56.468 --> 28:57.303
but that's it.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.839
Okay. Already,
I recognize this equation.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.507
It's used in
water-current analysis.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.876
Yeah, this is used
in the study of planets,

29:03.910 --> 29:05.177
determining how
they might have looked

29:05.211 --> 29:07.246
in the past, how they
may look in the future.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.315
These equations can tell us
the effect of water flow

29:09.348 --> 29:10.950
on topography.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.485
Well, he also stole
some tribal histories

29:13.519 --> 29:15.955
and population studies.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.356
Now, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.357
-Topography.
-Mm-hmm.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.525
Population studies.

29:19.558 --> 29:20.659
Yes? What?

29:20.692 --> 29:24.096
We think he may be doing
a settlement-pattern analysis.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.231
Yeah, just trying to infer

29:25.264 --> 29:28.134
where Native American
settlements might be located.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.069
Does that mean he's
looking for more remains?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.938
CHARLIE: Well, if he no longer
has the skull, there's

29:31.971 --> 29:33.806
no other way for him
to document his find.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.807
So could you

29:34.841 --> 29:35.975
duplicate his work from this?

29:36.008 --> 29:37.509
Could you tell me
where he's gone digging?

29:37.543 --> 29:40.379
I think the best method
would be... Voronoi diagrams?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.914
Voronoi diagrams.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.349
Yeah, used
in astronomy, biology,

29:43.382 --> 29:45.217
-geography...
-And archeology,

29:45.251 --> 29:47.519
where they're used
as a system for showing

29:47.553 --> 29:48.988
the influence
of a particular feature

29:49.021 --> 29:50.990
on a given set
of geographic sites.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.860
So it's like with a, with a
chain of fast-food restaurants.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.162
The location of each restaurant
within a city

29:56.195 --> 29:57.997
is mathematically determined

29:58.030 --> 30:00.967
by the location of other
restaurants in the chain.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.569
So in very simple terms,
the Voronoi diagram

30:03.602 --> 30:06.873
partitions the areas around
restaurants into cells

30:06.906 --> 30:08.975
For every person living
within that cell,

30:09.008 --> 30:11.077
the restaurant
defining that cell

30:11.110 --> 30:13.012
would be
the closest place to get

30:13.045 --> 30:14.113
a cheeseburger.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.482
So we do the same thing
with ancient water sources.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.118
We try to find other
desirable natural features

30:19.151 --> 30:21.120
to find the most likely
settlement sites,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.122
but, in order
to do that, I'm gonna need

30:23.155 --> 30:25.391
all the information he took
from Clearwater's house.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.026
Well, Clearwater can't be

30:27.059 --> 30:30.296
the only tribal elder
with that information.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.198
The elders do have other copies,

30:32.231 --> 30:34.566
but we won't be
turning them over to you.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.568
A young woman's murderer
is still out there.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.871
The person that broke into
Chief Clearwater's house

30:38.905 --> 30:40.006
is still out there.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.875
I appreciate that, but the
information could also be used

30:42.909 --> 30:44.310
to unearth our burial grounds.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.312
That ship has already
sailed, Mr. Morris.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.281
Ken Hill has the information,
and he's armed.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.549
You asked me
to find him.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.951
That's what I'm
trying to do

30:51.984 --> 30:53.285
before anyone
else gets hurt.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.553
If we give
the federal government

30:54.586 --> 30:57.156
information that leads
to other burial sites,

30:57.189 --> 30:58.557
people, like Hill,

30:58.590 --> 31:00.559
will use it
for the same purpose.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.061
I'm sorry,

31:02.094 --> 31:05.031
but you'll have to find him
some other way.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.906
We got problems.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.374
Why, what?
The math doesn't jibe?

31:15.407 --> 31:16.475
The math always works.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.177
What I realize is this--

31:18.210 --> 31:21.180
There's way too many
possible locations.

31:21.213 --> 31:24.350
You think Hill's working
off better information?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.584
No. I spoke to some people

31:25.617 --> 31:27.219
at CalSci's Social
Sciences Department.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.989
I spoke to several
anthropologists as well, and

31:30.022 --> 31:32.191
what they tell me is
what Hill is trying to do

31:32.224 --> 31:34.060
is almost, well, really,
almost impossible.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.061
Why?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.095
The skull?

31:36.128 --> 31:38.330
It's a once-in-a-lifetime find.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.366
You can't just
go out and expect

31:40.399 --> 31:42.368
to find ancient human remains
at other sites,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.536
no matter how much math you do.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.139
Yeah, but, Charlie,
I mean, the guy is desperate.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.074
But he's also a scientist.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.376
He has to realize
the same things I did.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.644
We still getting hits
on his credit cards?

31:52.678 --> 31:55.381
Yeah, I have
the list right here.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.216
I mean, there's one
site where he knows

31:57.249 --> 31:58.550
he might find what
he's looking for.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.087
Where the skull itself

32:01.120 --> 32:02.088
was originally found?

32:02.121 --> 32:04.090
Here it is.

32:04.123 --> 32:08.060
The last four hits were
right by the school site.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.962
MEGAN: He's gone back
to the original dig site

32:09.996 --> 32:11.097
to find more bones.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.671
What have we got?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.073
Positive I.D.
It's Hill's car.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.208
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.576
All right, Tommy, Bill
why don't you head out that way.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.012
David, come with me. Let's go.

32:57.043 --> 32:57.976
Dr. Hill?

33:02.048 --> 33:04.050
I need more time.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.417
Look, it's over.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.253
No, you do not understand.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.554
They will bury it where no one

33:08.587 --> 33:10.256
-will ever find it again.
-You don't understand.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.491
I want you to drop that tool,
stand up right now.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.426
The only chance I have is
to find another set of bones.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.162
I'm the only chance you have.
Now, listen up.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.465
Stand up, put your
hands behind your back.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.300
Please.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.446
I was just trying to make
Jennifer's death mean something.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.581
( handcuffs click shut )

33:35.614 --> 33:36.682
Let's go.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.802
He's an egomaniac,

33:56.835 --> 34:00.272
but he alibis for the night
of the murder.

34:00.306 --> 34:03.242
All right, we got him on assault
and theft but... no murderer.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.444
And Clearwater doesn't read
for it.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.578
I think we got something.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.446
DON:
Yeah?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.715
A list of disenrolled
tribe members.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.717
It was in the census info
we got at the mission.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.352
What's
disenrolled?

34:13.385 --> 34:14.420
DAVID:
Every Wiyana tribe member

34:14.453 --> 34:16.822
gets an annual cut
of the profits from the casino.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.458
Only about ten years ago,
the tribal council

34:19.491 --> 34:22.361
started to remove members from
its records, disenrolling them

34:22.394 --> 34:25.697
for lack of family ties...
even if a DNA test might prove

34:25.731 --> 34:27.199
legitimate tribe
membership.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.500
Right, the more money
that comes in,

34:28.534 --> 34:29.835
the less people they have
to split it with.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.204
Yeah. There's one name
on that list that jumps out.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.472
Frank Lopez.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.873
What's that, the security guy?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.842
Turns out he's part Wiyana.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.211
Only in 1998,
the tribal council decided

34:39.245 --> 34:40.712
it wasn't a big enough part.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.216
My Mom was Native American.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.284
Why does it matter?

34:45.317 --> 34:46.385
Well, it mattered
to the Wiyanas.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.887
They cut you out of your share
of the casino money.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.157
Hey, I was nowhere near
that girl when she was murdered.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.391
You can check
the security tape.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.294
Yeah, you were conveniently
on the other side of the museum

34:55.327 --> 34:56.195
when she was attacked.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.863
DON: You make the same circuit
every night,

34:57.896 --> 34:58.930
which puts you on this side
at 1:30.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.233
So why don't you tell us
why you changed the route

35:01.267 --> 35:02.901
that night,
hmm?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.636
Frank, when it comes
to murder,

35:04.670 --> 35:06.505
it doesn't matter whether
you killed her or not...

35:06.538 --> 35:07.773
MEGAN:
Not if you were the one

35:07.806 --> 35:09.541
who let her killer in
that night.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.410
Is that
what happened?

35:15.314 --> 35:17.449
My mother died without a penny.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.220
And she was buried a Wiyana.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.788
And then...

35:22.821 --> 35:27.693
some piece of paper
changed all of that.

35:27.726 --> 35:31.197
He told... he told me
if I helped him get the skull,

35:31.230 --> 35:34.466
he'd place my mother's name
back on the tribal rolls.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.304
And she'd be who she was again.

35:41.707 --> 35:45.277
...and the dividends
per share...

35:45.311 --> 35:46.345
Agents...

35:48.947 --> 35:50.582
I understand you found the man

35:50.616 --> 35:51.683
who attacked
Chief Clearwater's wife.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.951
Yes, we did.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.853
We also found
Jennifer Abernathy's murderer.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.722
Hill's confessed?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.290
Hill didn't kill her.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.691
I don't understand.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.794
Do you want to tell him
about it, Mr. Clearwater?

36:05.731 --> 36:06.798
You're not serious.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.802
This is our Chief.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.838
I've known this man
my whole life.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.340
He'd never harm anyone.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.609
But you did harm someone,
didn't you?

36:20.912 --> 36:22.581
You make a mistake,

36:22.614 --> 36:24.450
then you spend
every waking hour

36:24.483 --> 36:29.455
tracing back all the decisions
that got you there.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.324
But why, James?

36:32.358 --> 36:34.826
Because it had to stop.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.330
You're running this tribe
like it was a corporation.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.700
We have a responsibility
to do what's best.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.868
Best?

36:42.901 --> 36:43.969
Best for who?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.003
Who are you

36:45.036 --> 36:47.506
to decide that a person's
heritage wasn't his own?

36:47.539 --> 36:51.810
Until that casino was built,
we were all one people.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.747
No one cared how far back
a bloodline went.

36:55.781 --> 37:00.252
Only that skull holds a truth
that even you're afraid of.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.820
And knowing I have it...

37:01.853 --> 37:05.357
well, suddenly
that forces you to stop.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.762
Where is the skull?

37:10.796 --> 37:13.732
It's at rest.

37:13.765 --> 37:17.469
In a place known only to myself.

37:17.503 --> 37:18.470
For now.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.944
DAVID: James Clearwater,
you are under arrest

37:25.977 --> 37:29.681
for the murder
of Jennifer Abernathy.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.749
This way.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.531
It's sure ironic, isn't it,

37:45.564 --> 37:47.966
that an ancient skull could have
such significance

37:47.999 --> 37:50.602
for people today.

37:54.506 --> 37:59.010
That a man could matter
so much to so many.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.479
What about him?

38:00.512 --> 38:01.947
What was his name?

38:01.980 --> 38:05.417
How did he die on a hillside
10,000 years ago?

38:05.451 --> 38:08.554
Yeah, did his family
wonder what happened?

38:08.587 --> 38:09.755
Did anyone cry for him?

38:14.360 --> 38:17.496
Real faith
cannot transcend knowledge.

38:17.529 --> 38:21.367
It has to adapt
to it and embrace it.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.638
And bones...

38:28.940 --> 38:30.342
They don't make the man.

38:30.376 --> 38:33.545
And they sure don't make
the soul.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.049
DON:
Are you sure about this?

38:38.083 --> 38:40.752
I mean, you don't have
to do it.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.388
Yeah, we didn't mean
to push you to do anything.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.456
You didn't push me.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.993
I just realized that what
I was really trying to keep

38:48.026 --> 38:50.128
had nothing to do with what
was in these boxes.

38:50.161 --> 38:54.400
Somehow, I just got it
in my head

38:54.433 --> 38:56.001
that giving
your mother's things away

38:56.034 --> 38:57.936
meant something
was coming to an end.

38:57.969 --> 39:01.773
You know, like a sign that
she didn't matter anymore.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.112
But I'll tell you something...

39:07.145 --> 39:11.016
snapping at the two of you
did matter to me.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.017
It would've mattered to her.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.652
Yeah, it's all
right, Dad.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.020
It's all right.

39:15.053 --> 39:18.490
You know, we, uh...

39:18.524 --> 39:20.526
well, we're not really a group
hug kinda family, but...

39:20.559 --> 39:21.760
Yeah, no kidding.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.662
That's where a daughter
would've come in handy.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.730
Wait, maybe when you come back,

39:24.763 --> 39:26.031
we should just sit down
and talk.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.165
Just the three of us.
What do you think?

39:27.198 --> 39:28.767
You want us to come with you,
Dad?

39:28.800 --> 39:31.102
No!

39:31.136 --> 39:33.605
I mean, I have
to do this myself.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.676
( engine starting )

39:39.678 --> 39:47.553
( rock song playing )

39:47.586 --> 39:49.187
-We really gonna talk?
-I brought a six-pack.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.057
If things go south, we can
just watch the game.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.158
You want to laugh?

39:53.191 --> 39:56.928
That last box of stuff
that Dad packed into his car

39:56.962 --> 39:58.063
was my stuff.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.098
No way. Oh, no.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.800
I didn't have the heart
to tell him.

40:01.833 --> 40:02.668
Hey, you know,

40:02.701 --> 40:04.169
I don't have a problem
with hugging.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.671
I mean, I don't.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.540
I don't have a problem
with hugging, either.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.075
Get away from me!
