WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:24.517 --> 00:25.310
Mary?

00:26.482 --> 00:27.206
Joe!

00:27.620 --> 00:28.551
Thank God!

00:30.137 --> 00:31.379
Mary, what were
you thinking?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.793
That the public
should be made aware

00:33.793 --> 00:36.551
that that rapist is
wandering free in St. John's!

00:36.551 --> 00:39.241
Blake Harrison has not been
convicted of any crime.

00:39.241 --> 00:40.931
He's guilty, Joe!

00:40.931 --> 00:41.620
I know it!

00:42.448 --> 00:43.620
You were harassing
his patients.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.931
No, I was warning
potential victims!

00:45.931 --> 00:47.344
You vandalized his clinic!

00:47.344 --> 00:48.655
His clinic?

00:49.310 --> 00:50.896
He calls himself
a physiotherapist.

00:50.896 --> 00:52.275
He's more like
physio abuser!

00:52.275 --> 00:53.241
Stop.

00:53.241 --> 00:54.931
How do you
know that?

00:54.931 --> 00:56.551
Because I believe
his accusers!

00:56.551 --> 00:57.586
I sympathize
with you, Mary.

00:57.586 --> 00:58.275
I do.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.758
But belief-

00:59.758 --> 01:01.448
is not proof!

01:06.793 --> 01:08.034
What are you hoping
to achieve here?

01:08.034 --> 01:09.172
I want him
to suffer-

01:09.172 --> 01:11.000
the same way he made
those women suffer!

01:14.620 --> 01:16.517
Mary, I know this last
year has been hell.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.620
But the death of
your daughter-

01:18.620 --> 01:19.344
My daughter-

01:19.344 --> 01:22.448
didn't just
die Joe!

01:22.448 --> 01:23.517
She was murdered!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.655
And women are being abused
and beaten and killed-

01:25.655 --> 01:26.896
by men who
go unpunished!

01:26.896 --> 01:28.896
And something
has to be done!

01:32.379 --> 01:33.137
I'm worried about you.

01:34.241 --> 01:35.793
I appreciate that Joe.

01:35.793 --> 01:37.275
But I am fine.

02:06.862 --> 02:07.758
You know, Mary-

02:09.793 --> 02:11.000
grief is a journey.

02:13.793 --> 02:15.862
And I know you're slowly
navigating your way through it.

02:18.827 --> 02:21.724
But you've got to believe
me when I tell you-

02:21.724 --> 02:23.103
that throwing
your life away-

02:23.103 --> 02:24.827
in order to ruin
someone else's-

02:26.827 --> 02:28.034
is not going to
fix what happened-

02:28.034 --> 02:29.000
to your daughter.

02:32.827 --> 02:33.551
Yeah.

02:35.068 --> 02:35.793
Yeah.

02:38.655 --> 02:39.620
Yeah, you're right.

02:41.517 --> 02:43.000
Harassing Blake Harrison-

02:44.103 --> 02:45.482
isn't going to
change anything.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.793
So do you
promise to stop?

02:51.586 --> 02:52.413
Yeah.

02:55.137 --> 02:56.000
Good.

02:58.655 --> 02:59.344
Good.

03:01.620 --> 03:02.655
Let's get you
out of here.

03:03.724 --> 03:04.482
Okay?

03:05.379 --> 03:06.344
Come on.

03:16.896 --> 03:17.965
Mr. Harrison?

03:20.655 --> 03:21.862
Mr. Harrison?

03:23.862 --> 03:25.206
Mr. Harrison?

03:28.379 --> 03:29.344
Oh God!

03:47.896 --> 03:49.620
We really have to stop
meeting like this.

03:52.241 --> 03:53.379
Blake Harrison is dead.

03:54.827 --> 03:57.172
Guess I won't be harassing
him anymore now!

03:58.551 --> 03:59.896
This isn't
a joke, Mary.

04:00.551 --> 04:01.586
I'm not going
to pretend

04:01.586 --> 04:03.896
the world isn't a better
place without him in it.

04:03.896 --> 04:05.620
Are you saying that
you're glad that he's dead?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.310
I'm not sorry.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.310
But I didn't kill
Blake Harrison.

04:15.206 --> 04:16.137
I'm going
to need you

04:16.137 --> 04:18.862
to account for your
whereabouts last night-

04:18.862 --> 04:20.586
after you were
released from here.

04:20.586 --> 04:21.482
Hmm.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.137
You'll have to
talk to my lawyer.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.758
I'm not saying
another word.

04:35.448 --> 04:36.931
The victim
is Blake Harrison.

04:36.931 --> 04:39.413
The guy who does the
rounds on morning TV?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.379
The very same.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.068
Called himself
The Physio Dude.

04:42.068 --> 04:42.724
Right.

04:42.724 --> 04:43.862
What was his
story again?

04:43.862 --> 04:46.068
He started working
with elite athletes.

04:46.551 --> 04:47.413
Then pivoted.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.344
Into doing pro bono work
for people with disabilities.

04:50.344 --> 04:52.137
Leaned heavily into
his good guy image-

04:52.137 --> 04:53.896
when he was put on trial
for sexual assault

04:53.896 --> 04:55.344
in Corner Brook
a few years ago.

04:55.344 --> 04:57.172
It worked, if I
remember it correctly.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.448
He wasn't convicted.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.206
A case of he
said, she said-

05:00.206 --> 05:03.448
according to the judge
who tried the case.

05:04.103 --> 05:04.758
Right.

05:05.379 --> 05:06.310
What's the body
telling us?

05:06.310 --> 05:07.103
Not much.

05:07.931 --> 05:10.034
No external
signs of trauma.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.517
Judging by rigor mortis-

05:11.517 --> 05:13.206
I'd say he died in this
position peacefully-

05:13.206 --> 05:14.241
in his sleep.

05:14.241 --> 05:15.689
And judging by the
lipstick on his forehead-

05:15.689 --> 05:16.931
I'm guessing he wasn't
alone last night.

05:16.931 --> 05:18.310
I'd agree.

05:18.310 --> 05:21.862
But I can't find any evidence
as to who he was with.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.413
What have
you got, pal?

05:50.172 --> 05:51.724
Take a look
at this.

05:51.724 --> 05:53.068
Look at that.

05:53.931 --> 05:55.586
That much damage-

05:55.586 --> 05:57.068
can't have happened
by accident.

05:57.068 --> 05:57.793
Yeah.

05:58.068 --> 05:59.586
A grudge against
a camera?

06:03.310 --> 06:04.206
Hmm.

06:04.379 --> 06:05.275
Track it pal.

06:16.551 --> 06:18.724
Ah, looks like there's nothing
but just papers in there pal.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.655
Look at that.

06:30.206 --> 06:31.655
Oh, I don't even
want to know.

06:33.655 --> 06:34.448
Let's see.

06:37.793 --> 06:40.931
Photos of a lot of
different women.

06:40.931 --> 06:43.482
Too bad the prosecutors in
Corner Brook didn't have that.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.586
And it gets worse.

06:50.551 --> 06:52.482
Looks like Rex hasn't
finished his investigation.

06:52.482 --> 06:55.482
I'm afraid to know what else
Harrison has hidden around here.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.206
Looks like somebody
was trying to break in.

07:12.758 --> 07:14.551
I'll dust for prints.

07:18.551 --> 07:19.448
This is interesting.

07:20.931 --> 07:21.862
What's that?

07:21.862 --> 07:25.206
Those three circles
next to the prints.

07:25.206 --> 07:27.241
The complainant against Harrison
was one of his clients.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.482
His physio clients.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.068
You think that's
an orthopedic cane?

07:32.275 --> 07:33.000
Huh.

07:33.862 --> 07:35.275
Good find, partner.

07:43.551 --> 07:44.206
Hey.

07:44.310 --> 07:45.310
Hey.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.724
Have you finished your
preliminary assessment?

07:47.724 --> 07:48.551
Yes.

07:49.551 --> 07:51.827
Um- nothing unusual,
beyond the lip print.

07:51.827 --> 07:53.827
He was in good health, according
to his medical records.

07:54.827 --> 07:55.793
No prescriptions?

07:55.793 --> 07:57.965
No, why?

07:57.965 --> 08:00.620
A toxicology report-

08:00.620 --> 08:04.448
showed he had enough
oxycontin in his system-

08:04.448 --> 08:05.448
to kill an elephant.

08:05.448 --> 08:07.896
So he didn't die
of natural causes.

08:08.896 --> 08:10.068
Accidental overdose?

08:10.068 --> 08:11.482
Well this lipstick print

08:11.482 --> 08:13.241
tells us he
wasn't alone.

08:13.241 --> 08:15.586
It's pretty hard to kiss
your own forehead.

08:15.586 --> 08:16.310
Exactly.

08:16.310 --> 08:17.379
And if it was
an accident-

08:17.379 --> 08:18.896
then whoever
left the print-

08:18.896 --> 08:20.206
would've called it in.

08:20.206 --> 08:22.068
So this is likely
a homicide.

08:24.931 --> 08:25.862
I remember-

08:25.862 --> 08:27.551
the Blake Harrison case.

08:27.551 --> 08:29.068
If the charges against
him were true-

08:29.068 --> 08:30.689
then the woman
that went to court

08:30.689 --> 08:32.000
probably wasn't
the only one.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.827
He could have had
a lot of enemies.

08:35.965 --> 08:37.413
How to narrow
down that list?

08:37.413 --> 08:38.793
Well lip prints are
like fingerprints.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.379
No two are
exactly alike!

08:43.724 --> 08:44.724
That'll help.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.379
I'll get you a copy
of the print-

08:46.379 --> 08:48.275
and a sample of the
lipstick right away.

08:48.275 --> 08:49.206
Thank you.

08:51.724 --> 08:52.482
Here.

08:52.482 --> 08:53.448
Harrison gave
this statement-

08:53.448 --> 08:54.758
after he was
acquitted last year.

08:54.758 --> 08:56.482
Listen, I'm a
guy who loves women.

08:56.482 --> 08:57.448
And women
love me okay?

08:57.448 --> 08:59.448
I don't need to throw
myself at them.

08:59.448 --> 09:00.413
Oh and
by the way-

09:00.413 --> 09:02.275
now that this matter's
all settled up-

09:02.275 --> 09:04.482
I'll be in time for ladies'
night at Kool Katz.

09:04.482 --> 09:05.310
Just saying.

09:05.896 --> 09:07.344
You should come
too, sweetheart.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.206
Yeah, good judge of
character as always, pal.

09:11.206 --> 09:12.655
Yeah, social media
is blowing up.

09:12.655 --> 09:15.206
I mean, sentiment's
divided about the victim.

09:15.206 --> 09:18.379
And there's all these
rumours of the Lipstick Killer.

09:18.379 --> 09:20.724
I had a feeling the housekeeper
wasn't going to keep quiet.

09:20.724 --> 09:23.620
Yeah, there's no way that
cat's climbing back in the bag.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.275
We just need
to push forward.

09:25.275 --> 09:26.689
Jesse, where are we at
with the investigation?

09:26.689 --> 09:29.034
Well I got off the phone
with some of his colleagues-

09:29.034 --> 09:30.137
at the physio practice.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.344
There's no indication
that he was an opiate user.

09:32.344 --> 09:34.586
He was accused of dosing
his victim with opiates-

09:34.586 --> 09:35.793
before he assaulted her.

09:35.793 --> 09:37.517
I don't like
this guy, but-

09:38.379 --> 09:39.620
I don't know.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.448
I guess I'll do my job as if
it were any other victim right?

09:42.655 --> 09:43.793
I'll look into
the accuser.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.241
Look, I don't have
to tell you guys-

09:46.241 --> 09:48.241
that none of these accusations
were proven in a court of law.

09:48.241 --> 09:49.413
Joe.

09:49.413 --> 09:51.517
I'm just saying that it's
left some people outraged.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.758
There could also
be other victims-

09:53.758 --> 09:55.000
that we don't
know about.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.068
Which is why we need to find
out where he was last night.

09:57.068 --> 09:58.689
No one's
come forward yet.

09:58.689 --> 10:00.034
But the lipstick print-

10:00.034 --> 10:02.034
definitely a message.

10:02.034 --> 10:02.827
I've analyzed the pigment.

10:02.827 --> 10:03.827
It's Rogue Red by
Lady Beaumont.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.310
It's a pretty
common brand.

10:05.310 --> 10:07.931
It can be found at multiple
locations in town and online.

10:07.931 --> 10:09.655
Okay we need to find
out who that belongs to.

10:09.655 --> 10:10.689
You brought
Mary McQuire in.

10:10.689 --> 10:12.586
Do you think she has
anything to do with this?

10:12.586 --> 10:13.827
Uhh.

10:13.827 --> 10:16.379
Mary refuses to
disclose her movements-

10:16.379 --> 10:18.034
at the time of Blake
Harrison's death.

10:18.793 --> 10:21.206
Grief can make you do
unimaginable things.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.137
Yeah.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.310
You know what?

10:23.310 --> 10:24.482
I'm going to take
another run at her-

10:24.482 --> 10:25.724
see if I can make
some headway.

10:28.827 --> 10:29.448
Jesse.

10:29.448 --> 10:30.344
Hmm?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.517
See if you can identify
any of the women-

10:32.517 --> 10:33.517
in these photos.

10:38.827 --> 10:39.965
Are you okay?

10:40.586 --> 10:42.551
Sick to my
stomach, actually.

10:42.551 --> 10:43.827
Charlie, is
there any other way-

10:43.827 --> 10:45.275
to find out who
he was dating?

10:45.275 --> 10:48.586
Yeah it just feels like such
a violation of their privacy.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.724
Yeah, I don't
like it either.

10:50.724 --> 10:52.482
But there's a
killer out there.

10:52.482 --> 10:53.896
I don't know how
we can avoid it.

10:53.896 --> 10:54.931
Jesse.

10:54.931 --> 10:56.758
We do know that he saw
at least one patient-

10:56.758 --> 10:57.862
outside of work.

10:57.862 --> 10:58.965
Do you have
his client list?

10:59.517 --> 11:01.275
I'll cross-check it.

11:06.379 --> 11:07.137
Oh.

11:08.448 --> 11:09.551
Thanks, buddy.

11:10.448 --> 11:13.896
Good thing we've got our
big furry empathy bomb.

11:14.931 --> 11:15.965
Whoa, that was
faster than I thought.

11:15.965 --> 11:16.965
You find something?

11:16.965 --> 11:18.758
One of the women in the
photos is Wendy Clark.

11:19.862 --> 11:21.275
She was Harrison's patient.

11:28.931 --> 11:30.068
Uh, Ms. Clark.

11:30.068 --> 11:32.448
Are you sure I can't take you
somewhere more private?

11:32.448 --> 11:33.758
I don't have
a lot of time.

11:33.758 --> 11:34.551
This is fine.

11:35.655 --> 11:36.724
All right, um-

11:36.724 --> 11:39.413
In the course of a
homicide investigation-

11:39.413 --> 11:40.103
my colleagues and I-

11:40.103 --> 11:41.827
Blake is dead,
I know.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.344
Could you cut to
the chase already?

11:44.379 --> 11:46.448
We found photographs-

11:46.448 --> 11:49.517
of you in Blake
Harrison's home.

11:49.517 --> 11:51.000
Intimate photographs.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.689
Yeah, me and the
Physio Dude hooked up.

11:53.689 --> 11:55.931
That's not illegal
last time I checked.

11:55.931 --> 11:58.103
And you're aware
of the allegations-

11:58.103 --> 11:59.000
against Mr. Harrison?

11:59.310 --> 12:00.655
He did
nothing to me.

12:00.655 --> 12:01.551
We had a fling.

12:01.551 --> 12:02.586
It was consensual.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.344
And it's none of
your damn business.

12:04.655 --> 12:06.241
And I want my
pictures back.

12:06.241 --> 12:08.931
Well they are evidence
in a murder investigation.

12:08.931 --> 12:11.931
I can get them back to
you once they're released.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.862
Blake Harrison had my permission
to take those things.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.310
The police do not have my
permission to keep them.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.931
Yeah, I understand
your distress.

12:18.931 --> 12:21.413
Oh, you are the
source of my distress.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.379
What happened with Blake and
myself behind closed doors-

12:28.379 --> 12:29.689
is our business.

12:29.689 --> 12:31.000
Not yours.

12:31.206 --> 12:32.344
Yup.

12:36.034 --> 12:37.448
My client wishes
to inform you that-

12:37.448 --> 12:40.310
she was attending her weekly
mixed martial arts seminar-

12:40.310 --> 12:41.896
the night of Blake
Harrison's murder.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.689
Here is a printout-

12:43.689 --> 12:45.689
of the class list
for that night.

12:45.689 --> 12:47.724
You'll note her
name right here.

12:47.724 --> 12:51.586
And this is a dated
photograph of my client

12:51.586 --> 12:54.000
dominating her opponent
with a guillotine choke.

13:00.034 --> 13:01.862
That's good form.

13:03.758 --> 13:05.379
Mary, why didn't
you just tell me-

13:05.379 --> 13:06.793
that you had an alibi
for that night?

13:06.793 --> 13:08.965
My client wishes
to remain silent.

13:08.965 --> 13:10.172
You know I would
have been relieved-

13:10.172 --> 13:11.689
to eliminate you
from suspicion.

13:14.551 --> 13:16.896
What, this is how
it's going to be now?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.241
We're not even
speaking to each other?

13:18.241 --> 13:20.793
My client has made
her wishes very clear-

13:20.793 --> 13:22.103
Superintendant Donovan.

13:24.241 --> 13:25.241
You know your
lawyer's reputation?

13:25.241 --> 13:26.241
Right?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.034
She's tough.

13:28.034 --> 13:30.620
She also plays fast and
loose with the rule of law.

13:31.896 --> 13:33.896
Do you really want to trust
her more than you trust me?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.206
Okay, we're done here.

13:35.206 --> 13:36.103
Let's go, Mary.

13:36.551 --> 13:38.068
I do have one
thing to say.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.482
I'm all ears.

13:39.482 --> 13:41.758
You're investigating
Blake Harrison's death-

13:41.758 --> 13:44.620
with a lot more rigour than you
did the assaults he committed.

13:44.620 --> 13:45.758
The incident-

13:47.344 --> 13:48.241
the alleged-

13:48.241 --> 13:49.034
incident-

13:49.034 --> 13:50.827
took place in
Corner Brook Mary.

13:50.827 --> 13:52.413
That's outside my jurisdiction.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.206
It doesn't matter.

13:54.206 --> 13:55.862
Cops are the same
everywhere you go.

13:55.862 --> 13:57.137
That's not true.

13:59.068 --> 14:01.000
We found the man who
killed your daughter.

14:02.310 --> 14:03.689
And we put
him in prison.

14:09.517 --> 14:10.344
Okay.

14:29.551 --> 14:31.344
Okay well could you have
- Ms.
- Hynes contact me-

14:31.344 --> 14:32.275
as soon as possible?

14:32.827 --> 14:33.620
Thanks.

14:35.103 --> 14:35.724
Anything?

14:35.724 --> 14:36.448
I don't think so.

14:36.448 --> 14:37.137
They had a relationship.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.517
But it was consensual.

14:38.517 --> 14:39.275
Even the photos?

14:39.275 --> 14:40.344
Yeah.

14:40.344 --> 14:41.137
Guys.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.896
I might have something.

14:47.206 --> 14:49.965
I found a longer clip from just
outside the police station.

14:53.413 --> 14:56.448
I wonder how many of those
women Blake Harrison assaulted.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.034
I wonder if his killer
is among them?

14:58.137 --> 14:59.551
Wait Jesse.

14:59.551 --> 15:01.482
Freeze right there.

15:03.034 --> 15:04.689
You remember those
marks that we found-

15:04.689 --> 15:05.655
in front of
Harrison's window-

15:05.655 --> 15:06.793
next to the footprints?

15:06.793 --> 15:07.620
Looked like a cane?

15:07.620 --> 15:08.793
That woman
has a cane.

15:10.517 --> 15:11.965
Jesse, can
you ID her?

15:11.965 --> 15:13.517
Maybe she
was a client?

15:13.517 --> 15:15.482
Maybe she's
in the photos?

15:15.482 --> 15:16.551
Yeah give
me two seconds.

15:16.551 --> 15:18.931
I've put faces to the
names on his client list.

15:21.241 --> 15:22.034
Yeah, there we go.

15:22.034 --> 15:23.275
That is one
Astrid Hynes.

15:23.379 --> 15:25.344
Blake Harrison's accuser.

15:25.344 --> 15:27.034
And her suit
was unsuccessful.

15:27.034 --> 15:29.241
And I've been trying to get
in touch with her with no luck.

15:29.241 --> 15:30.275
I've left two messages.

15:30.275 --> 15:31.827
Looks like we may
have a suspect.

15:42.758 --> 15:43.793
We appreciate
you coming in-

15:43.793 --> 15:45.068
Ms. Hynes.

15:45.068 --> 15:48.586
And we both understand this
must be very difficult for you.

15:50.172 --> 15:51.034
You
were a patient-

15:51.034 --> 15:53.068
of Blake Harrison's.

15:53.827 --> 15:54.896
In Corner Brook, yeah.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.103
That's where
he assaulted me.

15:57.103 --> 15:58.482
And that's where
the judge let him off-

15:58.482 --> 15:59.551
scot free.

16:00.931 --> 16:02.413
Did you have
any contact with him-

16:03.275 --> 16:05.448
since he moved
back to St. John's?

16:05.448 --> 16:06.827
No, of course not.

16:09.137 --> 16:10.310
Can you excuse
me for a moment?

16:38.931 --> 16:40.862
Do you recognize
this camera?

16:42.586 --> 16:43.413
No.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.724
Well Rex thinks
that you should.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.517
And Rex is
never wrong.

16:48.620 --> 16:49.965
Astrid, we
found footprints-

16:49.965 --> 16:51.241
outside of Blake
Harrison's home-

16:51.241 --> 16:53.034
that we believe
to be yours.

16:53.034 --> 16:54.413
That's ridiculous.

16:54.965 --> 16:56.206
We also found-

16:56.206 --> 16:57.827
impressions of your cane.

17:04.448 --> 17:05.758
Okay, I was there.

17:06.413 --> 17:07.862
A week ago.

17:10.586 --> 17:11.482
I broke in.

17:14.172 --> 17:15.517
I was trying
to find-

17:19.275 --> 17:20.344
I know
this is difficult.

17:20.965 --> 17:24.275
But it is best if
we know the truth.

17:30.137 --> 17:31.758
He took
photos of me.

17:33.310 --> 17:34.827
He told me
about it-

17:34.827 --> 17:37.103
after the trial,
when I lost.

17:38.896 --> 17:40.965
That's how
cruel he is.

17:46.172 --> 17:48.413
I wanted to destroy
the photos.

17:48.413 --> 17:49.275
Wouldn't you?

17:52.068 --> 17:53.137
But I couldn't
find them.

17:54.758 --> 17:55.793
I found his
camera though.

17:55.793 --> 17:58.137
And I smashed it.

17:58.137 --> 18:00.068
Because I wanted to
send him a message.

18:02.689 --> 18:03.724
That's all I did.

18:10.448 --> 18:11.310
Hey.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.241
You're going to
want to see this.

18:15.482 --> 18:16.620
The Low Life List?

18:16.620 --> 18:17.482
Yeah.

18:17.482 --> 18:18.965
You might recognize
a familiar face.

18:20.103 --> 18:21.413
Blake Harrison.

18:21.413 --> 18:22.724
What is this
website Jesse?

18:22.724 --> 18:25.068
It calls itself a record of
Newfoundland's sexual predators.

18:25.068 --> 18:26.724
Who created it?

18:26.724 --> 18:28.172
A company called
West Expert Design.

18:28.172 --> 18:30.068
But the domain is
registered to Mary McQuire.

18:30.068 --> 18:30.724
And-

18:30.724 --> 18:31.862
the site is administered-

18:31.862 --> 18:33.000
by Astrid Hynes.

18:34.000 --> 18:34.862
Astrid Hynes?

18:35.413 --> 18:36.413
The same Astrid
Hynes who's-

18:36.413 --> 18:37.896
In the interrogation
room, yeah.

18:39.862 --> 18:40.620
Thanks.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.448
Well if there
are no more questions-

18:46.448 --> 18:47.275
then I will just-

18:48.310 --> 18:49.862
Astrid Hynes?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.034
Uh- Astrid.

18:51.034 --> 18:52.034
This is Superintendent Donovan

18:52.034 --> 18:53.103
of the Major
Crimes Unit.

18:54.172 --> 18:55.137
Please, sit.

18:58.551 --> 19:02.000
I want to talk to you about your
involvement with Mary McQuire.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.448
Who?

19:04.620 --> 19:06.482
You run a
website together.

19:06.482 --> 19:07.862
It's called The
Low Life List.

19:11.413 --> 19:12.172
All right.

19:12.827 --> 19:14.310
We met at a
support group-

19:14.310 --> 19:16.137
for trauma survivors.

19:16.137 --> 19:18.310
We have interests
in common.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.896
There's nothing
wrong with that.

19:20.896 --> 19:24.517
Blake Harrison is listed as
a predator on that website.

19:24.517 --> 19:25.862
Because he was.

19:25.862 --> 19:28.103
Look, I know that
this looks bad.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.068
We exposed abusive men-

19:30.068 --> 19:31.896
through public protests
and online campaigns-

19:31.896 --> 19:33.344
in order to warn
other women.

19:34.586 --> 19:36.827
It doesn't make
us killers.

19:36.827 --> 19:37.724
Who
else is involved-

19:37.724 --> 19:38.965
with this website?

19:39.965 --> 19:41.931
It's just
Mary and me.

19:45.965 --> 19:48.517
She tried to lie
about knowing Mary.

19:48.517 --> 19:50.655
She could be covering
for somebody else.

19:50.655 --> 19:51.896
The question is- Who?

19:52.448 --> 19:53.482
Jesse mentioned a company-

19:53.482 --> 19:55.379
that was doing web design
for The Low Life List.

19:55.379 --> 19:58.275
A website like that is
legally dicey territory.

19:58.275 --> 20:00.448
They'd want somebody who
was sympathetic to the cause.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.137
Jesse probably has
a name for you.

20:02.137 --> 20:03.103
I'll check it out.

20:03.103 --> 20:04.413
Why don't I
go with you?

20:05.000 --> 20:05.724
That's a good idea.

20:06.862 --> 20:07.758
Come on pal.

20:14.551 --> 20:15.448
Yeah.

20:15.689 --> 20:17.793
West Expert Designs
is my company.

20:17.793 --> 20:20.206
What do you know
about the Low Life List?

20:21.793 --> 20:22.448
Oh.

20:22.448 --> 20:23.551
That website.

20:23.551 --> 20:26.689
Um- it's sad.

20:26.689 --> 20:28.482
I'm embarrassed
for those women.

20:29.448 --> 20:30.206
You mean-

20:30.206 --> 20:31.965
Mary McQuire
and Astrid Hynes?

20:31.965 --> 20:32.655
Yeah.

20:32.655 --> 20:33.482
And you
helped out-

20:33.482 --> 20:34.344
with their website?

20:35.517 --> 20:39.103
I mean I set up the site
according to their instructions.

20:39.103 --> 20:41.137
I might not agree
with their methods.

20:41.137 --> 20:42.000
But I mean-

20:42.000 --> 20:42.689
a paycheque's a paycheque.

20:43.379 --> 20:44.655
You don't know-

20:44.655 --> 20:46.379
any of the the men
who are on their list?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.241
Blake Harrison?

20:47.241 --> 20:49.103
I don't read
the content.

20:49.103 --> 20:52.379
I mean I just push pixels
together and make pretty images.

20:52.379 --> 20:53.862
He was murdered.

20:54.724 --> 20:55.655
Oh.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.344
Wow.

20:56.344 --> 20:57.068
Yikes.

20:57.379 --> 20:58.068
Uh.

20:59.413 --> 21:01.586
Yeah I mean if there's
anything I can do to help-

21:01.586 --> 21:06.793
But I'm not part of that silly
little man-hater crusade.

21:06.793 --> 21:09.103
If it were up to me the web
would just be filled with-

21:10.586 --> 21:12.931
people and pictures
of their pets.

21:13.793 --> 21:14.793
Isn't that right, buddy?

21:17.068 --> 21:18.482
Okay, well um-

21:19.172 --> 21:20.344
thank you
for your time.

21:24.655 --> 21:26.137
Do you believe her?

21:26.310 --> 21:28.586
You think the lady
doth protest too much?

21:28.689 --> 21:31.000
Jesse said she's not on
Harrison's client list.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.689
Hmm.

21:31.689 --> 21:33.034
I'll check in
with Jesse-

21:33.034 --> 21:35.068
see if she has any other
connection to the victim.

21:39.655 --> 21:42.827
The St. John's Police Department
must be held accountable!

21:42.827 --> 21:45.620
The police are interrogating
assault victims.

21:45.620 --> 21:46.862
Treating us like criminals-

21:46.862 --> 21:49.655
instead of investigating
the men who abused us.

21:49.655 --> 21:50.862
The SJPD-

21:50.862 --> 21:53.068
protects sexual predators!

22:03.448 --> 22:04.482
Mary.

22:04.482 --> 22:05.551
I can't talk
to you, Joe.

22:05.655 --> 22:07.586
I am not the enemy.

22:07.586 --> 22:09.965
You can't do this and
pretend to be my friend.

22:09.965 --> 22:12.206
A man was
murdered Mary.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.655
No matter my
feelings about him-

22:13.655 --> 22:14.965
we will investigate.

22:14.965 --> 22:18.068
While domestic abusers
and rapists go unpunished.

22:18.068 --> 22:19.482
The Police don't
protect women.

22:19.482 --> 22:20.310
Blake Harrison-

22:20.310 --> 22:22.275
was tried in a
court of law.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.793
With all available evidence.

22:23.793 --> 22:25.689
Right.

22:25.689 --> 22:27.206
Astrid wasn't the
only one you know.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.413
There were others.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.793
I need names Mary.

22:31.793 --> 22:33.896
They've been
through enough, Joe.

22:33.896 --> 22:36.620
And this case is
best left unsolved.

22:48.275 --> 22:50.137
Hey, boss.

22:50.793 --> 22:51.689
Everything okay?

22:52.896 --> 22:54.137
You know, Jesse-

22:54.137 --> 22:57.068
sometimes I wonder if police
fail to take victims seriously.

22:57.758 --> 22:58.482
What do you mean?

22:59.827 --> 23:00.896
Well this Low Life List-

23:01.827 --> 23:02.931
it's controversial.

23:03.931 --> 23:06.310
But it's also detailed
and well-researched.

23:07.206 --> 23:09.758
And I can't help but wonder
if the information here-

23:09.758 --> 23:12.034
could be used to help us
in our investigations.

23:12.896 --> 23:15.068
Well I mean I
guess it depends-

23:15.068 --> 23:16.586
on which website
you take seriously.

23:16.586 --> 23:17.482
I mean, some
of them-

23:17.482 --> 23:18.241
are well researched.

23:18.241 --> 23:19.620
And others are
dodgy as heck.

23:19.620 --> 23:20.689
You know?

23:20.689 --> 23:22.586
Calling out men for
various offenses.

23:22.586 --> 23:23.275
Dodgy how?

23:23.275 --> 23:24.275
Okay well-

23:24.275 --> 23:25.758
The Low Life List,
for example-

23:25.758 --> 23:28.551
they make criminal
accusations, right?

23:28.551 --> 23:30.620
Others websites- they just
air out dirty laundry-

23:30.620 --> 23:32.000
about dates
that went bad.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.655
Look at this one
for example.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.206
There.

23:36.413 --> 23:37.517
Grade Your Date.

23:37.931 --> 23:41.034
The internet's largest
Sifter date review site.

23:43.379 --> 23:44.137
Oh okay.

23:44.137 --> 23:45.206
Yeah I see
what you mean.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.275
This seems
to be just-

23:47.275 --> 23:49.034
just gossip
and sour grapes.

23:49.034 --> 23:49.689
Yeah.

23:52.931 --> 23:53.827
Oh my God!

23:53.827 --> 23:54.896
Is that you?

23:54.896 --> 23:56.241
I can't believe that!

23:57.206 --> 23:58.586
I remember this date!

23:58.586 --> 23:59.965
I had no idea
she felt that way!

23:59.965 --> 24:00.724
I just-

24:01.827 --> 24:03.344
I mean, I thought I was
being a perfect gentleman!

24:03.344 --> 24:04.310
That's all!

24:04.310 --> 24:06.206
Yeah it was probably
just a misunderstanding.

24:07.965 --> 24:09.827
Um-

24:09.827 --> 24:10.689
Jesse you
should stay on-

24:10.689 --> 24:12.482
the Harrison clients okay?

24:12.482 --> 24:14.034
And just see if
there's anyone who's-

24:14.206 --> 24:15.310
who's unhappy.

24:15.310 --> 24:16.758
Yeah, will do.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.206
You should do
that now Jesse.

24:34.862 --> 24:38.482
But for her to post such
vehement online condemnation?

24:38.482 --> 24:39.862
How about you tell
us about the date-

24:39.862 --> 24:42.068
and we try and
figure it out?

24:42.068 --> 24:42.931
I don't know!

24:42.931 --> 24:44.344
It was a rather
uneventful coffee date.

24:44.344 --> 24:45.689
Or so I thought.

24:45.689 --> 24:46.586
No second date?

24:46.689 --> 24:48.689
No, there was
no spark.

24:48.689 --> 24:50.103
But nothing bad happened.

24:50.103 --> 24:52.586
I'm sorry she said such
mean things about you.

24:52.586 --> 24:53.827
I don't know.

24:54.655 --> 24:56.172
Maybe I shouldn't have
ordered for her I guess.

24:56.172 --> 24:56.862
I don't know.

24:57.655 --> 24:58.965
You ordered for her?

25:00.379 --> 25:02.310
Yeah, it was her first
time at Coffee Cathedral.

25:03.517 --> 25:05.206
I wanted her to try
the matcha latte.

25:05.689 --> 25:07.758
Their matcha lattes
are transcendent!

25:07.758 --> 25:09.206
Exactly!

25:09.310 --> 25:10.275
I'm not big on
matcha lattes.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.965
I don't get what all
the fuss is about.

25:13.896 --> 25:16.931
Well maybe it was presumptuous
of me to order for her.

25:16.931 --> 25:19.482
But I certainly
didn't act like a-

25:19.482 --> 25:21.448
old fashioned toad-

25:21.448 --> 25:23.689
with a stick
up his-

25:27.034 --> 25:28.000
I don't know.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.379
Maybe I should just
reach out to her-

25:29.379 --> 25:30.793
and contact her?

25:30.793 --> 25:31.551
No.
- No way.

25:31.551 --> 25:32.275
No no no.

25:32.275 --> 25:33.517
Do not contact her.

25:33.517 --> 25:34.517
But don't stress
over it either.

25:34.517 --> 25:35.482
Joe.

25:35.482 --> 25:36.655
You two just
weren't a good fit.

25:36.655 --> 25:37.586
Yeah.

25:37.586 --> 25:39.517
I mean some people
like matcha lattes.

25:39.517 --> 25:41.482
And some people have
no taste whatsoever.

25:41.482 --> 25:42.172
Okay.

25:44.344 --> 25:46.862
Well, you know, it
just feels terrible-

25:46.862 --> 25:47.896
knowing that there's
someone out there-

25:47.896 --> 25:51.000
who thinks such
awful things about me.

25:51.000 --> 25:51.931
Look.

25:51.931 --> 25:53.689
People post all sorts
of things online-

25:53.689 --> 25:54.931
that they wouldn't
say to your face.

25:56.551 --> 25:58.103
Also that's just one
person's opinion.

25:58.206 --> 25:59.448
Right?

25:59.448 --> 26:01.379
Someone else would have found
the exact same thing charming.

26:01.379 --> 26:02.655
Let it go
and move on.

26:03.551 --> 26:04.448
Yeah.

26:05.827 --> 26:09.241
I just hope this whole
dating thing is worth it.

26:09.896 --> 26:10.689
Thanks ladies.

26:13.206 --> 26:14.275
Hey.

26:14.275 --> 26:15.068
Jesse, what's up?

26:16.172 --> 26:16.793
Okay.

26:16.793 --> 26:17.551
I'll be right there.

26:24.689 --> 26:25.896
Sarah.

26:25.896 --> 26:28.000
Charlie said you wanted to
know more about Melanie West.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.241
Blake Harrison's website.

26:29.241 --> 26:31.241
Yeah, look at the
bottom of the page.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.724
Recognize that logo?

26:32.724 --> 26:34.000
West Expert Design.

26:36.482 --> 26:37.137
You were right.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.275
There is a connection.

26:38.275 --> 26:40.379
Melanie West said she'd never
heard of Blake Harrison.

26:41.103 --> 26:41.758
Huh.

26:54.689 --> 26:56.275
Not here.

26:56.275 --> 26:57.275
Uhhh-

26:58.655 --> 27:00.275
Should we
wait for her?

27:01.965 --> 27:03.068
Yeah we should.

27:05.379 --> 27:06.310
Check this out.

27:08.206 --> 27:10.655
Melanie said she didn't
know Mary and Astrid.

27:10.655 --> 27:11.793
They look pretty
friendly here.

27:11.793 --> 27:12.655
Well, here.

27:12.655 --> 27:16.241
I picked up Lady
Beaumont Rogue Red.

27:16.448 --> 27:17.103
Good thinking.

27:18.379 --> 27:19.241
Hey Rex.

27:21.793 --> 27:22.620
Track it.

27:41.034 --> 27:41.793
Look at that.

27:41.896 --> 27:43.724
Lipstick print.

27:43.724 --> 27:45.103
Good job, pal.

27:45.103 --> 27:45.793
Well I'll test it.

27:45.793 --> 27:47.862
But I trust
Rex's nose.

27:49.000 --> 27:49.655
Yeah!

27:49.655 --> 27:50.448
Let's go.

27:57.482 --> 27:59.275
His name
is Robert Crowne.

27:59.275 --> 28:00.896
Crowne with an
e on the end.

28:01.482 --> 28:03.172
He was supposed to
be back two days ago.

28:03.172 --> 28:05.241
But he's not
answering his phone.

28:05.241 --> 28:07.000
Please, I don't
know what to do.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.689
Ma'am?

28:08.689 --> 28:09.482
Excuse me.

28:09.482 --> 28:12.034
Uh- did you say
Robert Crowne?

28:12.034 --> 28:13.517
Yes he's my husband!

28:18.000 --> 28:18.793
According to this-

28:18.793 --> 28:20.344
Robert Crowne
has been the target

28:20.344 --> 28:21.586
of numerous
harassment lawsuits.

28:21.586 --> 28:22.965
Yeah, apparently he's
paid a lot of money-

28:22.965 --> 28:23.793
to have them disappear.

28:23.793 --> 28:25.344
What do you
have on his wife?

28:25.344 --> 28:28.206
She says that it's unusual
for him to go this long-

28:28.206 --> 28:29.310
without getting in touch.

28:30.689 --> 28:31.379
Yeah.

28:31.931 --> 28:32.586
We've got a lead.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.379
Who?

28:33.379 --> 28:34.310
Melanie West.

28:34.310 --> 28:35.724
The web designer
for The Low Life List.

28:35.724 --> 28:37.551
She lied about not
knowing Astrid and Mary.

28:37.551 --> 28:38.517
She's not
at her office-

28:38.517 --> 28:39.482
and not answering
her phone.

28:39.482 --> 28:40.758
Yeah well that
could be a problem.

28:40.758 --> 28:42.413
We have another
potential victim.

28:42.413 --> 28:43.482
Robert Crowne.

28:43.482 --> 28:44.862
Yeah another
name on the Low Life List.

28:44.862 --> 28:46.137
His wife just reported
him missing.

28:46.137 --> 28:47.172
And we need
to find him.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.724
I think the best
way to go about it-

28:48.724 --> 28:49.586
is to find
these women.

28:49.586 --> 28:51.034
I'll start pinging phones.

28:51.517 --> 28:52.379
Okay, in the meantime-

28:52.379 --> 28:53.413
I'm going to head
to Melanie's house-

28:53.413 --> 28:54.137
see if she's there.

28:54.137 --> 28:54.827
That's a good idea.

28:54.827 --> 28:55.655
Sarah-

28:55.655 --> 28:56.689
you do the same
thing with Astrid.

28:56.689 --> 28:57.896
I'm going to try
to find Mary.

28:57.896 --> 28:58.655
Okay.

29:00.862 --> 29:01.931
Hi, you've
reached Mary.

29:15.896 --> 29:17.241
Excuse me!

29:17.241 --> 29:19.206
Can I help you
with something?

29:20.310 --> 29:21.724
Yeah, Superintendent
Joe Donovan.

29:22.068 --> 29:22.724
Major Crimes.

29:23.620 --> 29:24.862
I'm looking for
Mary McQuire.

29:24.862 --> 29:25.586
Oh!

29:26.310 --> 29:27.000
Well-

29:28.000 --> 29:30.241
I seen her packing up
her Subaru this morning-

29:30.241 --> 29:32.344
like she was
going on a trip.

29:33.034 --> 29:33.758
A trip?

29:34.448 --> 29:35.413
Any idea where?

29:35.413 --> 29:37.034
I got no clue.

29:37.448 --> 29:39.655
She's always real secretive.

29:39.931 --> 29:41.275
Really?

29:43.482 --> 29:44.275
Thank you.

29:45.689 --> 29:46.586
Donovan.

29:46.931 --> 29:47.655
Hey.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.034
I've got Charlie
on the line too.

29:49.034 --> 29:50.310
Hey, Joe.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.103
Hey.

29:51.103 --> 29:53.034
No sign of Astrid
at her house.

29:53.034 --> 29:54.379
Yeah,
same at Mary's.

29:54.379 --> 29:55.724
Any luck at
Melanie's, Charlie?

29:55.724 --> 29:56.827
No I'm striking
out too.

29:56.827 --> 29:57.793
Come on pal.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.517
Hang on.

30:07.689 --> 30:08.448
Rex!

30:11.068 --> 30:12.034
What did you find?

30:12.034 --> 30:13.793
What is it Charlie?

30:21.344 --> 30:22.517
Did Rex find Melanie?

30:22.620 --> 30:23.275
No.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.034
But he did find a
bottle of oxycodone.

30:27.586 --> 30:28.689
And it's empty.

30:39.965 --> 30:42.965
Right now Melanie
West is our prime suspect.

30:42.965 --> 30:45.379
And with Mary
and Astrid MIA too-

30:45.379 --> 30:47.482
They could
be working together.

30:47.482 --> 30:48.344
Yeah hold on.

30:48.344 --> 30:49.379
I'm getting a
call from Jesse.

30:49.379 --> 30:50.413
I'm going to
link him in.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.586
What's going on Jesse?

30:52.896 --> 30:53.965
There's
been no activity-

30:53.965 --> 30:56.034
on Melanie West's cell
or credit card for hours.

30:56.034 --> 30:58.931
But Mary's phone pinged from a
wooded area near Petty Harbour.

30:58.931 --> 30:59.689
Great.

30:59.689 --> 31:00.586
Wait wait.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.724
Okay.

31:02.724 --> 31:04.275
It looks like Astrid's phone
is at the same location.

31:04.620 --> 31:05.379
Okay great.

31:05.379 --> 31:06.758
Text us the
coordinates Jesse.

31:06.758 --> 31:07.793
Yeah, I'm on it.

31:08.482 --> 31:09.206
Okay.

31:10.000 --> 31:10.827
Come on Rex.

31:11.655 --> 31:12.551
Yeah, we'll
meet you there.

31:13.551 --> 31:14.758
Listen Charlie!

31:14.758 --> 31:16.551
I need you to be discreet
when you get to the location.

31:16.931 --> 31:19.448
We do not want to scare
off our suspects.

31:19.448 --> 31:20.275
I'll see you there.

31:32.172 --> 31:33.413
It should be
just up ahead.

31:34.448 --> 31:36.034
What would they
be doing out here?

31:36.034 --> 31:37.344
Great place
to dump a body.

31:40.862 --> 31:41.655
What is that?

31:42.172 --> 31:43.241
It's coming
from up ahead.

31:44.655 --> 31:45.689
Okay.

31:45.689 --> 31:46.965
Let's fan out and
surround the clearing.

31:46.965 --> 31:47.931
You guys
go that way.

31:49.103 --> 31:49.965
Come on pal.

31:58.689 --> 32:01.310
All this
pain will pass!

32:01.310 --> 32:05.344
All this pain
will pass!

32:05.448 --> 32:09.551
All this pain
will pass!

32:09.655 --> 32:11.275
All this pain
will pass!

32:11.275 --> 32:12.551
SJPD!

32:13.137 --> 32:14.379
Nobody move!

32:14.379 --> 32:16.137
What the hell, Joe?

32:17.068 --> 32:17.724
It's okay.

32:17.724 --> 32:18.965
I know these guys.

32:20.034 --> 32:21.206
Congratulations.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.517
You just busted up a healing
retreat of trauma survivors.

32:23.517 --> 32:24.517
What do you want?

32:24.517 --> 32:26.689
Mary, we need to ask you
about Robert Crowne.

32:26.689 --> 32:29.241
I've been advised to talk to
you only through my lawyer.

32:29.241 --> 32:30.379
And she's not here.

32:32.586 --> 32:33.724
Let me handle this.

32:34.551 --> 32:35.379
Hey.

32:36.344 --> 32:38.068
We're so sorry to
disturb the gathering.

32:38.068 --> 32:39.620
But I need to ask
about Robert Crowne.

32:40.413 --> 32:41.793
What's there to say?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.655
He's a creep who harasses
female employees.

32:43.655 --> 32:44.862
He's gone missing.

32:44.862 --> 32:46.275
Missing?

32:46.275 --> 32:48.586
He's probably shacked up
in some no-tell motel.

32:48.586 --> 32:49.517
From what I've heard-

32:49.517 --> 32:51.379
he's a world class
philanderer as well.

32:56.206 --> 32:57.724
Want me to me
see if I can- ?

32:57.724 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, thanks.

33:02.103 --> 33:03.000
Hi.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.931
Uh- apologies for
the intrusion ladies.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.655
Trying to butter me
up with your dog?

33:09.275 --> 33:11.241
Eh, works sometimes.

33:11.965 --> 33:13.275
What do you want?

33:14.551 --> 33:16.103
Can you tell me
about Melanie West?

33:16.344 --> 33:17.689
Was she a part
of your group?

33:18.655 --> 33:20.344
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

33:22.206 --> 33:23.034
Sorry Mary.

33:25.068 --> 33:26.517
You just
lied to me.

33:35.172 --> 33:37.655
Look, I know that
you're hurting.

33:37.655 --> 33:40.689
I also know you don't
want to be responsible

33:40.689 --> 33:41.931
for a man's murder.

33:41.931 --> 33:43.241
And I won't be!

33:43.241 --> 33:44.482
If somebody kills
Robert Crowne-

33:44.482 --> 33:45.206
it's not on me.

33:46.793 --> 33:47.862
Where is Melanie West?

33:49.275 --> 33:50.827
Mary, please.

33:50.827 --> 33:52.793
Things only get worse for
Melanie from here on out.

33:52.793 --> 33:53.620
As her friend-

33:53.620 --> 33:55.689
I have no idea
where Melanie is.

33:55.689 --> 33:56.724
We have
reason to believe-

33:56.724 --> 33:58.344
that she may have
murdered Blake Harrison.

33:58.344 --> 34:00.103
Oh, come on.

34:00.103 --> 34:01.103
And that
she's responsible-

34:01.103 --> 34:02.517
for the disappearance
of Robert Crowne.

34:02.517 --> 34:04.172
Right.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.827
Keep blaming the victims.

34:05.827 --> 34:06.793
It's what you do.

34:10.931 --> 34:11.862
Superintendent Donovan?

34:11.862 --> 34:13.034
Sorry to interrupt.

34:13.034 --> 34:13.793
Yes, Karma?

34:13.793 --> 34:14.793
I've have some
lab results-

34:14.793 --> 34:16.275
that I think you're
going to want to see.

34:16.275 --> 34:17.896
As Rex indicated-

34:17.896 --> 34:18.793
the lipstick print-

34:18.793 --> 34:20.310
from Melanie West's
cup is a match-

34:20.310 --> 34:21.862
to the lipstick
on Blake Harrison.

34:21.862 --> 34:22.655
And the prints?

34:23.586 --> 34:24.413
There were only a
partial on the cup.

34:24.413 --> 34:26.034
But what we
have does match.

34:27.068 --> 34:29.137
So she was the one who
gave him the kiss of death?

34:29.655 --> 34:30.827
That's one
way to put it.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.241
Thank you.

34:40.965 --> 34:42.965
You withheld information
from us Mary.

34:44.344 --> 34:45.965
Now another man's life
may be in jeopardy.

34:45.965 --> 34:49.310
I fail to see a connection
between those two situations.

34:49.310 --> 34:52.103
The lip print on Blake
Harrison's forehead

34:52.103 --> 34:53.551
belonged to Melanie West.

34:53.551 --> 34:55.793
How can you
be sure of that?

34:55.793 --> 34:58.103
We matched it to a
cup in her office.

34:58.103 --> 35:00.000
And a lip print
is like a fingerprint.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.103
Unique to each individual.

35:02.103 --> 35:03.448
Which means-

35:03.448 --> 35:06.413
she was there
the night he died.

35:07.931 --> 35:08.724
God!

35:09.896 --> 35:11.620
She's always been a
bit of a wild card.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.862
But I didn't believe
she was capable of this.

35:16.137 --> 35:16.827
Listen.

35:16.827 --> 35:18.344
I want justice.

35:18.344 --> 35:19.689
Not revenge.

35:19.689 --> 35:21.896
If there's anything
I can do to help-

35:21.896 --> 35:23.275
with your investigation-

35:23.275 --> 35:24.034
I will.

35:29.275 --> 35:31.206
Well at least we've
got her cooperation.

35:31.206 --> 35:32.793
But we're no closer to
finding Robert Crowne.

35:32.793 --> 35:33.862
Or Melanie West.

35:33.862 --> 35:35.620
Guys, I might be able
to help with that.

35:35.620 --> 35:38.758
I tracked Robert Crowne's credit
card to this gas station.

35:38.758 --> 35:40.448
They pulled up the
security video for me.

35:40.965 --> 35:41.586
That's Robert Crowne.

35:41.586 --> 35:42.275
Wait.

35:42.275 --> 35:43.689
That's Melanie West.

35:43.689 --> 35:44.862
Jesse where is
this gas station?

35:44.862 --> 35:45.689
Eastern outskirts of town.

35:45.689 --> 35:46.724
But this was thirty
minutes ago.

35:46.724 --> 35:48.103
Do you have idea where
they were heading?

35:48.103 --> 35:49.206
According to
his credit card-

35:49.206 --> 35:50.931
he checked in to the Slumber
Motel in Stopperside.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.620
Time might be running
out for Robert Crowne.

35:52.620 --> 35:53.310
Come on pal.

35:55.310 --> 35:57.586
And Melanie West may be
about to claim another victim.

36:09.206 --> 36:10.827
Hotel Manager:
We don't have-

36:10.827 --> 36:12.068
a Robert Crowne registered.

36:12.068 --> 36:14.620
We know that he used his credit
card to reserve the room.

36:14.620 --> 36:16.448
Aren't you supposed to have
some kind of search warrant-

36:16.448 --> 36:17.344
or something?

36:17.344 --> 36:18.551
Sir, a man's life
may be in danger.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.724
You know what-
don't worry about it.

36:19.724 --> 36:20.758
We'll just go
room to room.

36:20.758 --> 36:21.862
I'm sure your guests
won't mind-

36:21.862 --> 36:23.000
being disturbed.

36:25.344 --> 36:26.310
217.

36:26.758 --> 36:27.413
Honeymoon suite.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.517
There's a honeymoon suite?

36:29.517 --> 36:31.310
No need to
be hurtful.

36:31.310 --> 36:32.793
Rex, let's go.

36:59.965 --> 37:00.758
Ughh!

37:06.206 --> 37:08.413
Aghhh! Aghhh!

37:12.034 --> 37:14.034
She was trying
to kill me!

37:29.689 --> 37:32.724
I caught her slipping
something into my drink.

37:32.724 --> 37:34.379
I pretended
to fall asleep-

37:34.379 --> 37:35.793
so I could see
what she'd do next.

37:35.793 --> 37:37.793
When she kissed me on
the forehead it hit me.

37:37.793 --> 37:39.034
She killed that
Harrison guy!

37:39.034 --> 37:40.724
So you decided
to kill her first?

37:40.724 --> 37:42.310
It was
her or me!

37:42.413 --> 37:43.896
So self-defense?

37:43.896 --> 37:45.103
Damn right!

37:45.551 --> 37:48.275
I didn't do anything wrong
here except save my own life.

37:57.068 --> 37:59.827
Tell us about
Blake Harrison.

38:01.689 --> 38:04.275
He taught me not to mix
business with pleasure.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.068
You two were in
a relationship?

38:09.137 --> 38:10.620
I wouldn't
go that far.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.241
We were seeing
each other.

38:12.344 --> 38:13.413
For how long?

38:14.689 --> 38:15.827
About a month?

38:16.689 --> 38:19.206
It ended the night that he
decided to choked me so hard-

38:19.206 --> 38:21.655
I had to wear a
turtleneck for a week.

38:23.689 --> 38:24.758
He choked you?

38:24.758 --> 38:25.827
Turns out that-

38:25.827 --> 38:28.206
Blake liked his women
one of two ways-

38:28.310 --> 38:29.344
unconscious-

38:29.344 --> 38:33.068
or scared for
their lives.

38:36.103 --> 38:38.000
I'm sorry that happened
to you, Melanie.

38:42.172 --> 38:44.310
I begged
him to stop.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.620
He said that
I wanted it.

38:49.689 --> 38:51.068
I didn't want that.

38:55.862 --> 38:57.551
And you didn't
report him?

39:01.103 --> 39:02.068
Your partner's a comedian.

39:02.068 --> 39:03.344
No I didn't
report him.

39:03.344 --> 39:05.379
Because I knew that that
wouldn't accomplish anything.

39:05.379 --> 39:08.448
Blake was handsome
and charming and-

39:08.448 --> 39:10.172
as close to a celebrity
as you get around here.

39:10.172 --> 39:11.000
So no.

39:12.413 --> 39:15.103
So you killed
him instead.

39:22.103 --> 39:23.379
We have overwhelming evidence.

39:23.379 --> 39:26.172
We don't need
a confession.

39:26.172 --> 39:29.965
But you may get more sympathy
with the court if you give one.

39:31.206 --> 39:32.379
Is that true?

39:33.448 --> 39:34.517
Yeah.

39:37.241 --> 39:38.068
Well then-

39:38.068 --> 39:40.448
I'll happily take
the credit for it.

39:40.448 --> 39:41.448
Mary McQuire
and the others-

39:41.448 --> 39:43.275
all they do is just
sit around complaining-

39:43.275 --> 39:44.931
about bad men getting
away with things.

39:44.931 --> 39:45.793
Well I-

39:45.793 --> 39:47.482
I actually do
something about it.

39:48.137 --> 39:49.827
So you were going
to kill Robert Crowne?

39:51.758 --> 39:52.758
Alas.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.862
The best laid plans are
often ruined by cops-

39:54.862 --> 39:56.724
who can't see
the big picture.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.034
Which is-?

40:00.310 --> 40:02.965
That I'm better at keeping scum
off the street than you are.

40:19.379 --> 40:21.517
Oh and then there was this
hottie in the R department.

40:21.689 --> 40:22.862
She played
hard to get.

40:22.862 --> 40:24.827
But I saw right
through it.

40:24.827 --> 40:26.068
Why are you
telling me all this?

40:26.068 --> 40:27.620
What, you're not impressed?

40:27.620 --> 40:28.379
Not really.

40:29.379 --> 40:30.310
Oh, I get it.

40:30.310 --> 40:32.206
You're one of those
modern sensitive males-

40:32.206 --> 40:33.965
afraid to make
one wrong move.

40:34.551 --> 40:36.000
I pity you, pal.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.034
Yeah, the feeling's mutual.

40:38.034 --> 40:39.137
Whatever.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.758
Where's my stuff, anyway?

40:40.758 --> 40:42.241
Cops grabbed everything
out of the motel.

40:42.241 --> 40:44.137
Oh it'll be out of evidence
as soon as you know-

40:44.137 --> 40:45.379
Robert?

40:49.310 --> 40:50.689
Brittany.

40:54.689 --> 40:55.896
Consider yourself served.

40:56.448 --> 40:57.551
I want a divorce.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.172
Brittany listen to me!

41:00.172 --> 41:00.896
Come back!

41:04.758 --> 41:07.275
I wouldn't cross
him if I were you.

41:12.965 --> 41:14.000
Thank you
for the ride.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.310
Well I'm glad you're
speaking to me again.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.068
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about Melanie.

41:19.827 --> 41:21.827
I'm sorry I arrested
you for murder.

41:22.310 --> 41:23.896
I'm not an
extremist, Joe.

41:23.896 --> 41:25.000
I'm really not.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.206
I'm just trying to protect
other women like Molly.

41:27.896 --> 41:29.344
Well we're trying to
do the same thing.

41:30.448 --> 41:32.206
Hopefully we can work
together in the future.

41:32.206 --> 41:33.517
I'd like to.

41:33.896 --> 41:35.000
But will you listen?

41:35.517 --> 41:37.172
Without asking me
for evidence?

41:38.241 --> 41:39.137
I will.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.379
I promise.

41:41.379 --> 41:43.206
But you need to
talk to me first.

41:43.413 --> 41:45.482
And not post
stuff on websites.

41:45.482 --> 41:46.965
Why shouldn't
I do both?

41:48.206 --> 41:51.379
People say such hateful
things online, Mary.

41:52.586 --> 41:55.689
It's hard to sort between
the lies and the truth.

41:56.827 --> 41:59.793
You sound like you're speaking
from personal experience.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.517
What happened?

42:07.310 --> 42:08.103
This happened.

42:14.137 --> 42:15.310
You're on Sifter?

42:16.586 --> 42:18.000
I never would
have guessed it.

42:19.758 --> 42:22.965
She's complaining because
you opened the door for her?

42:22.965 --> 42:23.689
Yeah.

42:24.379 --> 42:25.379
Yeah, and
that I tried-

42:25.379 --> 42:27.103
to carry in her
shopping bags.

42:27.103 --> 42:28.034
Well-

42:28.517 --> 42:30.931
basically she's upset
you were chivalrous?

42:31.241 --> 42:32.206
Yeah!

42:32.206 --> 42:34.344
That's exactly what
I was going for, yeah.

42:34.344 --> 42:35.689
Dating is hard, eh?

42:35.689 --> 42:37.344
Yeah that's an understatement.

42:39.655 --> 42:41.000
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

42:47.068 --> 42:47.896
For the record-

42:49.206 --> 42:51.896
if a man held the door for me,
and carried my shopping bags-

42:53.241 --> 42:54.344
I'd love it.

42:55.275 --> 42:57.551
I'd absolutely love it.
