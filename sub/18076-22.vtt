NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:29.097 --> 01:30.591

01:30.682 --> 01:33.848

from a maximum-security stockade...

04:03.126 --> 04:04.371
Nothing.

Nothing about you scares me.
But what makes me mad...

04:08.339 --> 04:09.917
is you people moved in here.

A policy that doesn't include us building
our meeting house or settling down there.

Look, the only reason the Society
isn't moving off...
