with his sheep.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.909
Feel free to look around.
Scene's been processed.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.738
Not sure what you think
you're gonna find.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.524
If she's out here,
we're already behind.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.660
It's ATV tracks.

11:45.487 --> 11:48.272
Your men come out here
on ATVs?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.274
Not recently.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.885
These are recent--
less than 24 hours.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.538
Did your men track these?

11:53.582 --> 11:54.801
They tried.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.238
They run out
about 20 yards from here.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.634
Yeah.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.462
What is that?

12:05.289 --> 12:09.032
None of the bodies
were recovered over here.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.121
This was someone else.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.517
That handprint--
that could be Kensi's.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.953
Or it could be
totally unrelated.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.129
Yeah, but if it's not,
she doesn't have long out here.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.524
We need to get in the air,
make up for lost time.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.047
Yeah.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.745
[Rosa panting]

12:25.788 --> 12:28.617
How do you feel?
That was a really nasty fall.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.445
How is your arm?

12:30.488 --> 12:32.142
My arm? [chuckles]

12:32.186 --> 12:34.710
It'll be okay.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.364
[sharp inhale]

12:36.407 --> 12:37.757
[grunts]Sorry, Rosa, sweetheart.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.890
You're gonna have to stay off
of it, okay?

12:40.934 --> 12:41.935
[grunts]

12:41.978 --> 12:43.806
I'm gonna put this on you.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.505
[grunts]

12:47.549 --> 12:50.073
We clean up nicely,
you and me, huh?

12:50.117 --> 12:52.032
[chuckles]

12:53.685 --> 12:57.080
Do you think
anyone else made it out?

12:58.865 --> 13:01.041
I don't know.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.173
I don't know.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.132
The older man.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.829
[woman screams]

13:06.873 --> 13:10.267
He had been watching over me
sinceLa Bestia.

13:11.703 --> 13:15.795
He said that I reminded him
of his daughter.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.754
She'd finally
made enough

13:18.798 --> 13:20.887
to pay his way,

13:20.930 --> 13:24.020
and they were going to build
a life together.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.676
In New York City.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.592
Is that where you wanted to go?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.289
No.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.292
Los Angeles.

13:36.076 --> 13:40.602
Before my mom died,
she wanted to go there for me...

13:40.645 --> 13:43.387
to work and...

13:43.431 --> 13:45.650
send...

13:45.694 --> 13:48.131
send money

13:48.175 --> 13:50.003
so I could leave.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.310
I'm so sorry.

13:54.137 --> 13:57.837
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you want them to.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.796
[sniffles]

14:01.579 --> 14:03.843
Are you a mother, Kensi?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.761
I want to be.

14:11.372 --> 14:14.070
Just haven't been that lucky.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.637
Like you said,

14:15.680 --> 14:19.859
sometimes things don't work out
the way you want them to.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.865
Well, I hope your luck changes.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.871
[sniffling]:
Um...

14:33.698 --> 14:35.700
Do you trust me?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.051
I'm gonna go

14:38.094 --> 14:39.530
on a scout, okay?

14:39.574 --> 14:40.967
It's okay. I...

14:41.010 --> 14:43.752
You're gonna stay here
and you're gonna rest your foot,

14:43.795 --> 14:45.362
and if you hear a noise--
if you hear anything at all--

14:45.406 --> 14:46.711
you stay quiet.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.365
No matter what.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.367
I will come back for you.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.326
[groans]

14:52.369 --> 14:55.198
I'm gonna come back for you.
I will come back for you.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.421
Agent Namazi, give me a sitrep.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.596
House is clear.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.032
Seal Beach PD is en route.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.252
We've, uh, secured
Lance Corporal Gomez, but

15:05.295 --> 15:06.601
he's not talking.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.732
ALIYAH:
He should consider his options

15:07.776 --> 15:09.517
given he just tried to kill us.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.866
You both okay?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.346
We're fine.
We tag-teamed him.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.738
Make sure you get Gomez

15:13.782 --> 15:16.698
to talk
before Seal Beach PD arrives.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.439
Any updates on your end?

15:18.482 --> 15:20.484
Nothing
coming out of the cartels.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.138
Doesn't mean
that they're not involved

15:22.182 --> 15:25.272
or that they don't know
what happened to Agent Blye.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.708
And we've confirmed

15:26.751 --> 15:28.971
this has nothing to do
with David Kessler?

15:29.015 --> 15:31.321
Kessler is very self-indulgent.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.888
If it were him, we'd know.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.064
He wouldn't be able
to help himself.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.545
Where are Sam and Deeks?

15:37.588 --> 15:39.764
They just lifted off
moments ago.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.462
They'll be running
an air-to-ground search

15:41.505 --> 15:42.898
over the entire area.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.421
I'm sure they'll find her, sir.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.596
I have every confidence

15:45.640 --> 15:48.904
in Agent Blye's ability, but...

15:48.948 --> 15:51.472
finding her when we have no idea

15:51.515 --> 15:53.256
where to look would be like

15:53.300 --> 15:55.519
[clattering in distance]finding a grain of salt
in a sandbox.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.521
Did you hear something?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.088
BENNY:
Yeah.

15:59.132 --> 16:02.004
That's the sound of you
violating my civil rights.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.484
You guys want to
take me to jail?

16:03.527 --> 16:05.094
Come on,
let's go, then.Shut up.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.575
Or what? You're gonna sic
your girlfriend on me again?

16:07.618 --> 16:09.011
What are we gonna find in there?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.230
No idea.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.757
What's happening?FATIMA: Stand by, sir.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.933
Agent Namazi,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.195
talk to me.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.544
Federal agents.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.089
You good?Yeah, groovy.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.177
You?

16:44.220 --> 16:46.005
Well, I wish it
weren't the case,

16:46.048 --> 16:48.137
but it's nothing I
haven't seen before.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.748
We should see what they know.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.315
This is the group
that came in with Kensi.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.274
They might know
what happened to her.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.447
Soldiers who hunt people...

18:42.947 --> 18:45.167
[vehicles approaching]

18:47.735 --> 18:50.129
Go on ahead.
Got to take a leak.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.850
[belt unbuckles]

19:28.254 --> 19:30.081
[gasps, screams]

19:31.996 --> 19:33.607
Did y'all just hear that?

19:33.650 --> 19:35.261
WOMAN:
Yeah. Legion and I
got it covered.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.740
Head back to camp.
Tell the others.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.960
Copy that, Ghost. On my way.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.314
[engine starts]

20:01.025 --> 20:02.984
FATIMA:
Sam and Deeks have any luck?

20:03.027 --> 20:05.291
They have yet
to pick up the trail.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.206
No word from Kensi?

20:07.249 --> 20:08.468
Nothing.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.122
I assume the soldiers
that hunt people aren't

20:11.166 --> 20:13.124
actual deployed military.That would be correct.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.040
The DoD does have some active
duty and National Guardsmen

20:16.084 --> 20:18.304
providing logistical assistance
at the border.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.610
However, it's not heavily
concentrated in California.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.743
Even so, federal law prohibits

20:22.786 --> 20:25.267
U.S. military
from being involved

20:25.311 --> 20:26.964
in domestic law enforcement.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.140
If there are soldiers there,
they're not ours.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.753
Or they are ours
and working on their own?

20:32.796 --> 20:35.451
Unlikely, but not impossible.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.410
If the other Marines who
are involved with Gomez

20:37.453 --> 20:39.238
caught wind that they
were compromised...

20:39.281 --> 20:41.022
They could be out there trying
to clean house and shut it down

20:41.065 --> 20:42.284
before it gets
any worse for them.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.807
And if they couldn't
do it themselves,

20:43.851 --> 20:45.156
then they might have
gotten some help

20:45.200 --> 20:47.768
from some bad apples
at ICE or Border Patrol.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.118
There's a sobering thought.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.729
Either way, we need
to let Sam and Deeks know.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.644
I'll make sure they know.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.906
What does Gomez say about Kensi?

20:55.950 --> 20:57.081
He might be the key to this.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.822
Nothing yet.
But I agree.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.477
Remember what I said,
Agent Namazi.

21:01.521 --> 21:04.698
Get Gomez to talk
before he leaves your custody.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.352
Exigent circumstances.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.529
One of our own
is on the line here.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.705
Yes, sir. We're on our way.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.837
Sounds like these soldiers

21:13.881 --> 21:15.535
who hunt people

21:15.578 --> 21:17.276
may be independent operators.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.190
I'm still trying to figure out
if they're

21:19.234 --> 21:21.236
cartel or some organized militia

21:21.280 --> 21:24.500
or just rednecks
out killing people for fun.

21:24.544 --> 21:28.374
I got to be honest,
those are all terrible options.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.332
The sooner we find out
what Gomez knows,

21:30.376 --> 21:31.681
the sooner
we can narrow it down.

21:31.725 --> 21:32.813
I'll keep you posted.

21:32.856 --> 21:33.988
Thanks.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.164
I mean, it could be
Benny's buddies.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.340
Trained Marines feeling like
they're backed into a corner?

21:38.384 --> 21:39.472
They'd be dangerous.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.038
Something to look out for.Yeah, well,

21:41.082 --> 21:43.737
at this point I'd go
for anything to look out for.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.529
Yo, real talk, do you think this
Border Patrol agent's right?

21:53.573 --> 21:56.184
That she'd have a slim chance
of survival out here?

21:56.227 --> 21:58.229
If we were talking
about the average person? Yeah.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.319
But that's not
what we're talking about.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.538
Knowing Kensi,
she built a house by now,

22:02.582 --> 22:04.018
with a Zen garden.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.848
Yeah.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.807
MAN:
Hey, whoa, whoa, come on.

22:10.851 --> 22:11.895
She's just a kid.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.157
She's not just a kid.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.377
She's committing illegal acts.

22:15.421 --> 22:18.772
Bringing in drugs
to poison our own.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.254
MAN:
Come on, Ghost.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.953
We're already in
way over our heads on this one.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.564
Not now, Legion.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.827
Secure the perimeter.

22:48.454 --> 22:53.023
Now, I'm gonna ask you
this question one last time.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.287
Your answer to it's gonna
determine what happens next.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.943
Where's your smuggler?

23:02.598 --> 23:04.295
Okay.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.385
Have it your way.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.821
[grunting]

23:07.864 --> 23:09.910
[chuckles]

23:09.953 --> 23:12.695
No! Stop! Help! Kensi!

23:12.739 --> 23:14.305
You speak English, huh?Kensi!

23:14.349 --> 23:15.568
Is that her name?

23:15.611 --> 23:17.700
Kensi?
Is that her name?

23:17.744 --> 23:19.659
Let her go!

23:19.702 --> 23:21.617
Is that how you get off--

23:21.661 --> 23:23.053
hurting helpless little girls?

23:23.097 --> 23:25.316
Yeah, well,
what a good soldier you are.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.361
[chuckles]

23:26.405 --> 23:28.537
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.191
Oh, yeah?

23:30.234 --> 23:31.671
Why not?

23:31.714 --> 23:34.282
'Cause I'm a federal agent.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.805
Oh.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.154
Federal agent. Wow.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.939
That's very impressive.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.201
I'm glad you think so.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.550
Now, why don't you
hand me the gun

23:41.594 --> 23:42.595
and get down on the ground.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.466
You first.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.512
[grunts]

24:01.309 --> 24:03.442
I want my lawyer.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.227
Not some JAG joker.
I want a real lawyer.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.142
Oh, okay. How are you
gonna pay for that?

24:08.185 --> 24:09.709
With your blood money?

24:10.536 --> 24:13.364
JAG lawyer sounds pretty good
right about now, doesn't it?

24:13.408 --> 24:15.541
Especially when you're looking
at a minimum of ten years

24:15.584 --> 24:16.629
for the smuggling.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.892
And then...
What is it for aiding

24:18.935 --> 24:21.285
in the kidnapping
of a federal agent?

24:21.329 --> 24:23.766
Well, at that point,
you're just a Netflix

24:23.810 --> 24:26.377
death row documentary.Mm.[scoffs]

24:26.421 --> 24:27.335
Get my lawyer.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.945
You're embarrassing yourselves.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.773
Okay, okay,
save your breath.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.950
Prison talk clearly doesn't mean
anything to this tough guy.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.125
[chuckles softly]

24:37.127 --> 24:39.390
Agent Kensi Blye. She's missing.

24:39.434 --> 24:40.696
I'm not talking
without my lawyer.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.089
ALIYAH:How about you
just listen?

24:42.132 --> 24:43.569
FATIMA:He knew he was
in trouble,

24:43.612 --> 24:45.309
so he had to get her
off his tail.

24:45.353 --> 24:49.531
Unfortunately for him, that
still leaves the Campo Cartel.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.620
Ooh, Pedro Silva--

24:51.664 --> 24:54.928
very scary dude.Well, human smuggling
is good business.

24:54.971 --> 24:58.192
But I wonder what's gonna happen
when Pedro finds out

24:58.235 --> 25:01.543
that his American connect
is snitching to the Feds.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.459
Oh, yeah, doesn't he
skin people alive?

25:04.503 --> 25:05.765
Ooh.Wonder what
he'd do when he

25:05.808 --> 25:07.331
finds out that you
have been talking

25:07.375 --> 25:10.465
to us.No lawyer I know
can save his skin from that.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.771
Ooh, you went there.I had to.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.729
It's a perfect setup.Yeah, it's perfect.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.473
My cousin.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.910
He asked me if I wanted
to make some money.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.999
Under the table.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.395
And?

25:28.744 --> 25:30.746
What kind of deal
can you offer me?He wants a deal?

25:30.790 --> 25:32.356
For that lame
little tidbit there?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.010
Man, I'm done
with this fool.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.795
He can take his chances
in prison.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.014
All I had to do was...

25:38.841 --> 25:41.757
...recruit a few
of my friends at the base.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.675
We... we took turns

25:46.719 --> 25:49.156
picking some cargo up
and stashing them in the house

25:49.199 --> 25:51.593
until someone came and got them.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.900
Because we're military,
Border Patrol

25:53.943 --> 25:56.685
never questioned us
or pulled us over.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.647
I didn't know
she was a federal agent.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.649
And I sure as hell
don't know where she is now.

26:03.692 --> 26:04.954
And that's the truth.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.565
When was the last time
you saw her?

26:06.608 --> 26:08.001
A couple days ago. Uh...

26:08.044 --> 26:10.133
we were supposed to meet
this morning.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.570
When I got there,

26:11.613 --> 26:13.572
there was no one in the spot,
and Raul said

26:13.615 --> 26:14.877
if they ever ain't there,

26:14.921 --> 26:16.705
that meant that
something bad happened, and...

26:16.749 --> 26:18.489
I figured
once you two showed up,

26:18.533 --> 26:20.013
something went down.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.196
FATIMA:
Admiral.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.546
We just spoke with Gomez.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.808
Can you patch Sam and Deeks in?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.201
KILBRIDE:
Go ahead. We're all on.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.550
FATIMA:
Okay, so Benny doesn'’t know

26:35.594 --> 26:37.117
anything about
Kensi's whereabouts,

26:37.160 --> 26:38.988
but he admitted
to everything else.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.077
I mean, that,
coupled with Kensi's evidence,

26:41.121 --> 26:43.036
should make a strong case
against the Pendleton ring.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.777
His buddies don't know
that they're busted yet,

26:44.820 --> 26:47.606
so whoever the soldiers are,
they're not the Marines.

26:48.432 --> 26:49.433
DEEKS:
Damn it.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.479
Thanks, guys.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.394
Keep digging.KILBRIDE: Have Agent Castor

26:53.437 --> 26:55.309
handle Gomez's transfer.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.702
You two come back to Ops.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.399
Got it. We're on our way.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.748
So Benny Gomez is a dead end.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.532
We're gonna find Kensi, Deeks.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.230
Yeah, just because
you keep saying that

27:03.273 --> 27:04.535
doesn't make it true.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.059
We're gonna find Kensi.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.844
But you got to keep
your head on straight.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.367
No, I'm good.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.631
Come on.Yep.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.033
What is that?

27:24.077 --> 27:25.469
Sam. Two o'clock.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.564
Take us down. Take us down!

27:33.608 --> 27:35.784
Copy that.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.494
Somebody left this
on purpose.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.235
Yeah. For us.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.889
That's Kensi's knife.

27:53.933 --> 27:57.719
"11 Militia." Good job, Kensi.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.808
That's my Bear Grylls
survivalist ninja.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.160
All right, guys, I'm gonna need
satellite coverage of this area

28:04.204 --> 28:06.902
for the last 24 hours.Putting in a request
for that satellite imagery now.

28:06.946 --> 28:09.949
That fire's recent.
Means she's close.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.646
Kensi left a message:
"11 Militia."

28:11.690 --> 28:13.561
I never heard of these guys.
Find out who they are.

28:13.604 --> 28:15.041
We need info
as quickly as possible.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.652
We'll be standing by.I'm gonna check the perimeter.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.051
[sighs]

28:25.094 --> 28:28.619
Look, I signed up to secure
the border, but this...

28:28.663 --> 28:30.317
What are we gonna
do with these two?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.275
This isn't
the old group.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.364
We don't just find the illegals

28:34.408 --> 28:37.628
and call the Border Patrol
anymore.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.849
This is war.

28:40.893 --> 28:44.635
For our freedom,
for our way of life.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.942
And all wars have casualties.

28:46.986 --> 28:50.816
MAN:
The sheep dog protect
the sheep from the wolves.

28:50.859 --> 28:54.341
And the wolves
are at our doorstep.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.038
If we give them an inch,

28:56.082 --> 28:58.519
they'll take everything.LEGION: And what if she

28:58.562 --> 29:00.739
actually is a federal agent?

29:00.782 --> 29:03.567
Federal agent?
Bringing dangerous people

29:03.611 --> 29:06.005
into our country.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.442
I call that treason.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.576
And the punishment
for treason is death.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.508
Anything?

29:31.552 --> 29:32.422
No.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.815
Let's talk
this through.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.295
We know these border militias.Yep.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.426
We know their MOs.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.298
All right, track
the migrants,

29:38.341 --> 29:39.778
seek to apprehend them.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.605
Things went south, Kensi
got caught in the crossfire,

29:41.649 --> 29:43.433
got away. That
makes her a loose end.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.914
Yeah, they chase her down
on ATVs, and if she's injured,

29:45.958 --> 29:47.437
then they have the advantage.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.831
They may have taken her
on an ATV, but if so,

29:49.875 --> 29:51.006
they need to refuel.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.442
They got a camp out here.So we jump back

29:52.486 --> 29:53.835
in the chopper,
we search for her?

29:53.879 --> 29:55.271
She could have gone
in any direction.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.664
We don't know which way.
Until then,

29:56.707 --> 29:58.057
we'll just be flying blind
and wasting fuel.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.754
All I know is that every second
that we stand here

29:59.798 --> 30:01.147
is a second she doesn't have.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.322
We don't have time for this.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.454
Deeks.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.456
ALIYAH: Go ahead, Sam.What is the holdup?

30:06.500 --> 30:09.329
I am rattling as many cages
as possible.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.896
What does that mean?

30:10.939 --> 30:12.375
It means, Agent Hanna,

30:12.419 --> 30:16.466
that, while our small agency
often provides you

30:16.510 --> 30:19.774
with the luxury of
gallivanting under the radar,

30:19.818 --> 30:22.733
I am left without the clout
that I sometimes need.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.126
FATIMA:
Okay, so, I've been scouring

30:24.170 --> 30:26.215
encrypted messages
on Telegram,

30:26.259 --> 30:28.870
and remember
The Sons of Our Fathers?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.132
How could we forget?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.874
They disbanded
after we put away Devon Walker.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.484
FATIMA:
Damn straight they did.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.051
However, some
of the more radical elements

30:36.095 --> 30:40.316
regrouped, and they moved
from Arizona to California, and

30:40.360 --> 30:42.318
they changed their name.Don't tell me.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.232
Don't tell you what?

30:43.276 --> 30:44.494
Yup. The 11.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.235
After the 11 states
of the Confederacy.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.497
[groans]

30:47.541 --> 30:50.500
Morons masquerading
as G.I. Joes,

30:50.544 --> 30:53.503
clinging on to
some fairy tale.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.766
Aw, geez, look
at that guy.

30:55.810 --> 30:59.248
If he got an order to haul ass,
he'd have to make two trips.

30:59.292 --> 31:03.252
So, they've been
recruiting in quiet.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.864
Encrypted chats. No press.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.474
ALIYAH:
That's why we didn't
know about them.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.172
Meet Rebecca Gordon.

31:10.216 --> 31:13.001
Their leader. She was second
in command to Devon Walker.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.394
Has a crazy
long rap sheet--

31:14.437 --> 31:16.439
assault with a deadly weapon,

31:16.483 --> 31:19.486
intimidation, harassment--
all involving immigrants.

31:19.529 --> 31:20.922
Shawna Forde copycat.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.055
We could have another Arivaca
waiting to happen.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.447
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.492
ALIYAH:
Here we go. Last year,

31:25.535 --> 31:27.189
Rebecca bought an old cabin

31:27.233 --> 31:28.712
near your current location, Sam.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.627
Sending you
the GPS coordinates now.All right.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.542
KILBRIDE: Agent Hanna.Yeah?

31:32.586 --> 31:34.327
I will activate a REACT team,

31:34.370 --> 31:37.025
but it's gonna take them a while
to reach you.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.636
You and Deeks are on your own
for a bit.We'll go on foot.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.769
We don't know
how many we're dealing with.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.031
We need the element
of surprise.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.294
Deeks, I'll fill
you in. Come on.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.384
It's one thing
to secure the border.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.908
That's why I
came down here.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.432
They're here illegally.
Something's got to...

31:52.475 --> 31:53.563
You okay?

31:53.607 --> 31:55.783
What are they going
to do, Kensi?

31:55.826 --> 31:57.176
I don't know.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.918
I doubt they know, either.

31:59.961 --> 32:03.312
Okay, um, do you
think you can move?

32:03.356 --> 32:04.879
Mm-hmm.Yeah? Okay.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.881
All right, so I need you
to do this for me.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.056
Push your back into mine.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.579
I'm gonna do
the same thing,

32:09.623 --> 32:11.016
and then we're both gonna
help each other stand.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.148
Okay? One, two, three.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.976
Push up, up, up, up, up, up.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.804
All right, good.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.323
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

34:38.989 --> 34:40.208
Kens.

34:41.470 --> 34:43.864
Drop your weapons!

34:48.173 --> 34:49.217
On the ground now!

34:49.261 --> 34:50.218
Drop it!

34:50.262 --> 34:52.916
Hands behind
your head.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.961
Lose the rifle.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.310
Lose it! Lose it!

34:55.354 --> 34:56.746
And the pistol.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.705
Turn around, put your
hands on your head.

34:58.748 --> 34:59.706
You good?

34:59.749 --> 35:01.142
I'm good.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.143
Hey.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.405
You okay?Is it over?

35:03.449 --> 35:05.277
It's over. Come here.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.235
It's over.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.933
Thank you, Kensi.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.852
Yeah.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.245
You found me.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.160
We're always gonna find our way
back to each other

35:19.204 --> 35:20.640
one way or
the other.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.642
Oh, my God, baby, we need
to get you to a hospital.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.165
It's okay.
It's just a flesh wound.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.210
Is it?Yeah.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.212
Baby...Hey.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.996
This is Rosa.

35:31.346 --> 35:32.956
Martin Atticus Deeks.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.828
How are ya?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.439
You're okay.

35:37.483 --> 35:38.832
You're okay.We're gonna
get you home.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.318
Hey.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.450
Hey.That was a hell
of a day today.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.191
Thank you for filling in.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.975
Couldn't have done it
without you.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.325
Anytime, Sam.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.501
You guys got
a good team here.

35:56.328 --> 35:57.459
Fatima.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.331
How was it being
back out in the field?

35:59.374 --> 36:00.723
Uh, it was good.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.248
Needed to shake off
some of the rust.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.250
KILBRIDE:
Your team did us all proud

36:05.293 --> 36:07.034
out there today, Hanna.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.078
And you,

36:08.122 --> 36:10.472
Agent De León, very impressive.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.779
We're obviously
gonna have to reschedule

36:12.822 --> 36:14.694
a proper sit-down
for another time.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.217
I'll be around in L.A.
for a bit.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.132
All right.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.439
Celebratory round on me.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.310
I got a lot to catch you up on.

36:28.447 --> 36:30.753
Fine work out there today,
everyone,

36:30.797 --> 36:32.059
fine work.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.278
Thank you, Admiral.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.844
Thank you.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.369
I, uh, have some things I
need to finish up, but...

36:37.412 --> 36:40.850
Agent Namazi, would love to run
some ideas about ops past you.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.462
I picked up a few tricks
at Naval Station Great Lakes,

36:43.505 --> 36:46.508
and I really think
they would fit nicely at OSP.

36:47.335 --> 36:50.033
Great. Um, consider it a date.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.340
And please, call me Fatima.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.950
Okay.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.561
Aliyah.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.218
Let me show you something.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.528
Found this a while back.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.749
When I heard you were coming in,
I brought it in with me.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.368
I took that back
when we were in BUD/S.

37:20.412 --> 37:21.978
That's when me
and your old man

37:22.022 --> 37:23.893
thought we were gonna
change the world.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.068
Uh...

37:25.112 --> 37:27.245
No, no, no. Keep it, Aliyah.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.117
What is it?

37:30.160 --> 37:33.773
I just didn't think I would miss
being home in L.A. this much.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.601
Thank you, Sam.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.211
Anytime.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.439
[clears throat]

37:48.831 --> 37:50.006
Um...

37:50.050 --> 37:52.574
sorry, I was just, uh,
finishing something.

37:52.618 --> 37:55.229
[sniffles]In the dark.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.710
Agent Namazi,
is there anything

37:57.753 --> 38:00.190
that you'd like to talk about?

38:07.023 --> 38:08.938
All right, then.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.766
Good night.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.380
It's, uh...

38:15.423 --> 38:19.471
it's hard for me, sometimes.

38:22.343 --> 38:26.042
With, uh, with
all due respect, sir...

38:26.086 --> 38:29.176
I'm not a cop.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.352
Or a Navy SEAL.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.268
I didn't have a Marine dad.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.835
I don't have the...

38:35.878 --> 38:38.490
awesome background
that the, uh... [sniffles]

38:38.533 --> 38:41.188
that the rest
of this team does, and...

38:41.231 --> 38:43.712
I can't get shot
or kidnapped

38:43.756 --> 38:45.497
and, um...

38:45.540 --> 38:47.847
and act like everything is fine.

38:52.547 --> 38:55.376
Agent Namazi,
I'm going to fill you in

38:55.420 --> 38:57.291
on a little secret.

38:58.553 --> 39:02.383
No one here is a superhero.

39:02.427 --> 39:05.299
We are, all of us, human.

39:06.518 --> 39:09.303
Even me, believe it or not.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.652
[soft chuckle]

39:10.696 --> 39:12.741
And I know that I told you
you should take

39:12.785 --> 39:15.918
as much time as you needed,
but today we were shorthanded,

39:15.962 --> 39:19.574
and we were working under
extraordinary circumstances.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.838
The thing is,
you stepped up to the plate.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.884
And it's these things--
these-these things

39:24.927 --> 39:27.277
that we don't choose...

39:27.321 --> 39:30.280
that make us who we are.

39:31.586 --> 39:35.634
And who you are
is one damn fine agent.

39:38.419 --> 39:42.510
And on nights like these,
you can always resort...

39:42.554 --> 39:44.338
to a good single malt.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.774
I find one
that's been aged

39:45.818 --> 39:49.212
about 16 years to do the trick.[laughs, sniffles]

39:49.256 --> 39:50.692
I, um...

39:50.736 --> 39:53.129
I don't really drink, sir.Now, that's something

39:53.173 --> 39:54.696
you can choose.[laughs]

39:54.740 --> 39:57.438
Rather an idiotic choice,
in my opinion,

39:57.482 --> 40:00.049
but maybe you'll change
your mind later.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.790
We'll see.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.226
Thank you, Admiral.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.446
Good night again.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.278
[door opens, closes]

40:20.766 --> 40:22.811
Sorry. You're supposed
to be sleeping.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.291
You need anything?

40:24.334 --> 40:26.467
No. I'm, uh, just happy
that you didn't let the doctor

40:26.511 --> 40:28.600
keep me overnight.[scoffs]

40:28.643 --> 40:31.167
What do doctors
know, right?

40:31.211 --> 40:32.560
Hey, um...

40:32.604 --> 40:34.997
do we... do we
know anything about Rosa?

40:35.041 --> 40:37.870
Yes. They said that
she's gonna get processed

40:37.913 --> 40:40.612
in a federal intake facility
at the Fairplex in Pomona.

40:40.655 --> 40:41.874
Okay.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.050
She's gonna be assigned
to a case officer.

40:44.093 --> 40:46.792
They're gonna help her try
to find relatives in the U.S.

40:46.835 --> 40:50.491
But they also said, if they
can't find any next of kin,

40:50.535 --> 40:53.668
then she might need
foster parents.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.497
[sighs]
Okay, whatever happens,

40:56.541 --> 40:58.499
we can't let her get sent back.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.327
She's got nowhere to go.
She's got no one

41:00.370 --> 41:02.285
to take care of her...We're not... we're not

41:02.329 --> 41:05.463
gonna let that happen.
We'll stay on top of it.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.377
I promise you.

41:08.248 --> 41:10.468
Now, you got to get some sleep.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.861
Come on.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.353
Mm.

41:30.139 --> 41:32.272
You know how lucky we are?

41:32.315 --> 41:33.621
[exhales]

41:33.665 --> 41:36.885
I think about that
every single day.

41:38.670 --> 41:42.108
And if I forget, you know
when I do remind myself?

41:42.151 --> 41:43.675
Hmm?

41:46.199 --> 41:48.027
I wake up

41:48.070 --> 41:51.291
and I open my eyes...

41:51.334 --> 41:53.511
and I look at you.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.214
I love you.

42:02.084 --> 42:04.609
KENSI:
Mm-hmm.

42:04.652 --> 42:08.134
DEEKS:
I'm so excited you're not dead.
