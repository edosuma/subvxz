00:14.747 --> 00:16.116
<i>And he's down. That's it!</i>

00:16.257 --> 00:19.435
<i>That's it.
Cleon "Slammin"' Salmon</i>

00:19.477 --> 00:22.855
<i>is still the Heavyweight
Champion of the World.</i>

00:22.855 --> 00:25.525
<i>What a deadly punch.
It's all over.</i>

01:05.707 --> 01:07.025
Hi. Two?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.296
Hey, buddy.

01:29.922 --> 01:32.300
Do me a favor.
My girlfriend don't like her tuna.

01:32.341 --> 01:34.802
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.304
What do you mean?
You just said it was undercooked.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.931
- Tell the guy.
- It's fine, Anthony. The guy is busy.

01:38.931 --> 01:41.893
Stacy, he's a monkey wrench.
It's his job. Look.

01:43.519 --> 01:45.313
Let me get that for you.

01:45.354 --> 01:47.565
See? Just tell him what you want
and he'll do it.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.859
- I'm not even that hungry.
- You know what?

01:49.901 --> 01:53.112
Look, this is a little raw.
Just put a little fire on it, all right, buddy?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.407
Sir, tuna is a very delicate fish.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.950
You think you're better than me?

01:57.950 --> 02:00.161
No, I don't think
I'm better than you, sir.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.914
Well, you talk to me like I never
ate a piece of fucking fish before.

02:02.955 --> 02:04.874
I'm sure you've had
some fish before, sir.

02:04.916 --> 02:08.085
You know what?
Tell the chef to cook it nice.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.297
And here, we need more butter.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.716
Okay.
I will be right back.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.801
- Yeah, you will.
- Thank you.

02:15.843 --> 02:17.553
Now we got no butter.

02:20.556 --> 02:22.433
Dave, can I get a re-fire?

02:22.475 --> 02:25.061
What did you just say to me?

02:25.102 --> 02:27.730
The guy on table 5 wants
it cooked a little bit more.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.733
No, they asked for it medium rare.
It's perfect.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.194
If he wants it cooked more
tell him to go shove it up his ass.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.113
You want me to tell that guy
to cook this in his ass?

02:36.155 --> 02:38.824
Yeah, within the inside of his anus.

02:38.824 --> 02:42.203
- Come on, Dave.
- Fine.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.374
Dave, come on.

02:46.415 --> 02:49.085
Fuck him if he doesn't know
what medium rare is.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.419
Are you kidding me?

02:50.461 --> 02:54.006
When I said cook it nice, I didn't mean
bring it back looking like a fucking turd.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.634
Sir, I actually do not cook the food.
I am just a waiter.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.302
A smart guy.

02:58.302 --> 02:59.887
You want to get smart with me,
smart guy?

02:59.929 --> 03:02.473
Great. What are you gonna do,
kick his ass?

03:02.515 --> 03:03.933
Yeah, maybe I am.
You want me to?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.768
Sure, go ahead.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.812
You always got to beat
the shit out of the loser.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.356
Like the waiter at the Macaroni Grill,
the waiter at the Olive Garden,

03:10.356 --> 03:11.941
the waiter at Buca di Beppo.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.652
Sir, here at the Slammin' Salmon
there are no problems, just solutions.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.530
You know what?
Here, you puck ass bitch. Here.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.823
You like that?
How about some of that?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.576
Tell me what that tastes like.
And you better say like shit.

03:22.217 --> 03:23.544
Like shit.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.455
Good, now get the fuck out of here
and bring us some swordfish instead.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.082
I'll be right back.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.834
And you better not spit that out.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.669
Okay, I will not.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.171
Thank you.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.509
Up yours, you shit bird.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.221
You've got to be
fucking fucking me.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.849
Were you just eating that piece
of fish on the floor?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.643
You have no idea.
This guy made me eat it.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.853
Really?

03:48.895 --> 03:52.398
A customer shoved the food in your
mouth and told you you had to eat it?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.692
Yeah. He actually told me
I couldn't spit it out too.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.236
Man, that's crazy.
What?

03:57.278 --> 03:59.780
And I'm the Prime Minister of Narnia.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.867
You're paying for that piece of fish.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.368
It was a send back.

04:04.368 --> 04:05.995
Then you should have put it
in the send back area.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.331
- You're paying for it.
- You know what?

04:08.372 --> 04:12.043
Fuck this, Carl.
I quit.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.920
Fine, but I'm not the one
you have to tell.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.547
You've got to tell the Champ.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
And I know you don't have
the guts to do it.

04:24.096 --> 04:27.934
All right then, I'll just leave.
Screw the Champ.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.937
You really think you can walk out of here
without telling the Champ?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.897
You remember Marty Millman?

04:32.939 --> 04:36.526
Marty Millman is breathing through
a hole in his throat right now.

04:36.567 --> 04:40.112
Rich, he will find you
and ass fuck you

04:40.112 --> 04:41.906
in the face or in the mouth.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.450
Fine.
Fine, I'll tell him to his face.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.327
- Okay, fine.
- I'll tell him myself.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.162
- Okay, go for it.
- I'm gonna go right now.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.914
- Okay, good luck.
- I'm not afraid of him.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.624
- Okay, bye-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.751
- We'll be here.
- Carl.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.462
In his face, right?

05:29.954 --> 05:32.165
Shit. Fuck it.
Fuck this.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.336
Hey, Carl.
Rich Parente is not a quitter.

05:50.057 --> 05:52.435
Guess we ain't getting
our swordfish.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.338
Dude, last night was sick.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.716
I was rolling with my boys
down at Club Merengue

06:23.716 --> 06:25.968
and they called last call.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.387
So I reminded them
it's now daylight savings

06:28.387 --> 06:30.640
and we got an extra hour.

06:30.681 --> 06:34.435
And in that hour
I had 5 Smirnoff Ices...

06:35.436 --> 06:38.898
and I walked out of there
with a Bangladeshi hooker.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.944
I banged her deshi
all night long.

06:44.820 --> 06:47.073
Where'd you go pimping
last night, playboy?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.992
I too had a wild night last night.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.703
I made sweet hot love
to an orangutan.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.789
Really?
A bachelor party?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.791
- Yeah.
- What'd it smell like?

06:56.791 --> 06:59.293
- Bananas mostly.
- Really?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.838
Guy, I'm pulling your leg.

07:01.879 --> 07:05.132
I did not fuck
an orangutan last night.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.093
I have student teacher
evaluations coming up.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.970
Keep going, playboy.
I'm listening.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.264
- There's one kid who--
- Hey.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.811
So, did you hear
who's coming back tonight?

07:16.853 --> 07:20.606
Yeah, Connor.
God, I can't believe it.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.109
Can you imagine
being the star of a TV show

07:23.150 --> 07:24.652
and then having to come back
and wait tables?

07:24.694 --> 07:27.363
I know.
It's humiliating.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.325
Hey, do you think you guys
will get it on again?

07:31.325 --> 07:34.537
Yeah right.
He should be so lucky.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.414
You don't get 2 bites of the apple,

07:36.455 --> 07:39.458
especially when it's Golden Delicious.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.669
Yeah.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.005
- Chow down.
- Yes!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.340
I'm starving.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.801
What you pigs are eating
is the blackened cod.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.680
It comes with rosemary mashed potatoes
and tempura mushrooms.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.348
It's blackened because-- hey!

07:54.390 --> 07:58.186
It's blackened because I bought 60 pieces
last Tuesday and it's gone bad.

07:58.227 --> 08:02.064
I'll give a free dessert to whoever
sells the most of this shit.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.816
- You bitch.
- Guys.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.569
I hate to be a ball buster,
but somebody was toking marijuana

08:06.611 --> 08:09.530
in the coat checkroom last night
and that is a big no no never.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.824
Rich, you put me on
for a double tomorrow.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.367
You said you needed
money for ballet school.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.328
I do, but I also told you

08:15.328 --> 08:17.496
that I'd get shin splints
if I work a double.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.749
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- That's right.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.876
Shin splints, okay, you're right.
I will change that right away.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.294
Who the hell is that?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.588
That's our new busboy.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.632
Donnie, could you
come over here, please?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.176
Donnie is Dave's twin brother.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.554
Straighten your fucking bow tie.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.307
No, you went too far.
Back.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.644
I'll warn you guys now,
he's a complete retard.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.020
- I told you not to call me that.
- You what?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.482
- I said you're the retard.
- You're the retard!

08:44.482 --> 08:46.234
- You're the retard.
- You're the retard.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.902
- You're the re--
- Shut up!

08:49.820 --> 08:52.323
- Weird.
- Donnie Kanogi, hi.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.992
- You a douchebag like your brother?
- No, I--

08:56.869 --> 08:58.829
- Donnie Kanogi.
- Tara.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.041
Don't worry about it.
My sister's a dick too. I get it.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.418
Ladies and gentlemen,
straight from TV land,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.379
our old friend Connor Rhodes!

09:06.420 --> 09:08.172
What's up? What's up?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.966
I missed each and every one of you.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.218
Look at him.
Look at this guy.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.262
- Hey.
- There you go.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.056
We watched you every single
Sunday for 2 weeks.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.891
Hot stuff.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.976
Dude!

09:21.018 --> 09:23.312
You did get a nose job.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.274
No, no, my hair is longer
and it makes my face look tiny.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.693
We noticed it looked smaller
on TV

09:28.693 --> 09:30.695
but we thought it was makeup.

09:30.695 --> 09:35.324
It's strange, I know, but the camera
actually takes 2 lbs off your nose.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.201
I think you took 2 lbs
off your nose.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.705
Nice one, Dick P.
But seriously, I did not get a nose job.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.582
Hey, true to form,
you're an hour late.

09:42.623 --> 09:46.169
- Nuh. Daylight savings.
- Then you should be an hour early.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.795
Pretty good.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.923
All right, everybody, hit the floor.
Let's have a big night tonight.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.592
Let's see some pep in that step.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.011
- Let's do it.
- I'm Donnie.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.804
- Welcome back.
- Thank you. Nice to see you.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.472
- Good to see you.
- You look good.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.641
- You do too.
- How are you doing?

10:04.228 --> 10:05.646
Frosty.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.398
So are you gonna be
all right with this?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.734
Yeah yeah. Well, you know,
I spent a shitload of cash I didn't have.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.110
So... got to eat.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.945
Go to work.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.198
- Okay. Working?
- Yeah.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.632
So what, you like quit
to be on a TV show?

10:32.673 --> 10:35.968
Yeah yeah, I got a lead role
on "CFI Hotlanta."

10:35.968 --> 10:38.387
- No way.
- Yeah.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.224
Connor walked out of here
in a blaze of glory.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.651
Yeah! Yeah!

10:51.692 --> 10:53.152
I'm famous!

10:53.778 --> 10:55.488
I'm famous!

11:01.577 --> 11:04.288
Cole slaw never tasted so good.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.334
Fucking big nose.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.003
Suck it. Eat a dick.
Eat a dick.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.214
Suck it. Lick it.
Stick it.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.924
Double dick it.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.469
And fuck you!

11:23.766 --> 11:25.309
- Cole slaw!
- Yeah.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.311
They killed me off
after 2 episodes.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.189
- How come?
- Because every time he came on TV

11:30.189 --> 11:32.316
America threw up in their mouths
just a little bit.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.484
Yes.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.530
Actually, it's because the actress
who plays the police commissioner

11:37.572 --> 11:40.575
and I took a little trip
to Ejacuidor together.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.703
Wait.
Isn't that Morgan Fairchild?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.913
It is Morgan Fairchild.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.123
- What?
- All right.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.332
- Dude!
- She's hot!

11:48.332 --> 11:51.002
But the creator of the show,
this guy named Dick Lobo,

11:51.043 --> 11:53.921
got jealous and suddenly
Detective Shep Winford

11:53.963 --> 11:57.675
would up dead in a petting zoo
with the killer's sperm in his shoes.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.386
Wait, his sperm was in your shoe?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.722
Whatever, dude.
Tell us about Morgan Fairchild.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.016
Was she wet? Was she dry?
Did she laugh? Did she cry?

12:05.016 --> 12:07.185
All right, day one of shooting,

12:07.226 --> 12:11.022
Morgan Fairchild is giving me
the stink eye something fierce.

12:11.022 --> 12:15.568
At the end of the day she says,
"I want to see you in my trailer."

12:15.610 --> 12:18.487
So I knock on the door,
open it up and go in

12:18.529 --> 12:22.575
and Morgan Fairchild is wearing
the tiniest piece of lingerie.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.912
I mean, it's not even lingerie.
It's like Silly String.

12:26.353 --> 12:28.456
- What color?
- See-through.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.750
- See-through?
- Like a spider web.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.210
That's so hot.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.337
She says, "I've got a little
welcome present for you."

12:34.420 --> 12:37.590
Takes out a gift wrapped box,
opens it,

12:37.590 --> 12:41.469
reaches in and pulls out,
and I shit you not,

12:41.511 --> 12:45.097
the biggest, blackest--

12:45.097 --> 12:47.433
- Welcome to Slammin' Salmon.
- Thank you.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.060
- Just one?
- Just one.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.312
- No, no, no.
- Not my section. Not my section.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.314
- He's definitely coming back.
- No he's not.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.441
No, no, no...

12:56.484 --> 12:57.985
Damn it!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.530
You do not seat 1 person
at a 4 top.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.989
Sorry, Guy.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.825
Can you please wait until I get back
to finish that story?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.453
- I can't wait.
- No dice, Jim Rice.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.956
- Come on.
- They've spoken, Guy.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.582
God!

13:11.624 --> 13:14.001
Shit.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.046
All right, she reaches in
and pulls out, and I shit you not...

13:17.088 --> 13:19.841
Hey, sport.
How are you?

13:19.882 --> 13:22.677
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.
I'm Guy.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.137
Well, hello, Guy.
I'm Horace, and thank you.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.181
No!

13:29.350 --> 13:32.645
Sounds like someone
told a great story.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.897
Yes it does.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.740
Connor, I just sat you.
Welcome back.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.743
It's good we didn't get a booth.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.538
Don't forget
your Slammin' Salmon smile.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.081
Is that a real thing?

13:52.123 --> 13:54.000
- Do I need to know that?
- Yeah.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.003
Honey, I'm not hungry.
Can we just split a couple things?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.590
Hi, welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.759
- Okay.
- My God, I know you.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.679
- Really?
- Yeah, I definitely know you.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.348
- Where do I know you from?
- Maybe he's in your spinning class.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.310
- He looks like a spinner.
- Honey, he's not a spinner.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.687
God, it's driving me crazy.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.606
I know I've seen
you somewhere before.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.150
Is it from TV do you think?

14:20.735 --> 14:23.070
Yes, I've got it.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.489
Yeah, you waited on me
last time I was here.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.126
Duh.

14:28.426 --> 14:32.205
Well, I left for a while to be one
of the leads on "CFI Hotlanta."

14:34.665 --> 14:37.668
No way. I'm the black woman
from "Law & Order," so...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.630
- You're so funny.
- Thanks.

14:41.271 --> 14:44.300
- I'll have a Merlot.
- Dry Sack, rocks.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.265
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:51.307 --> 14:53.726
from Hell's Kitchen, New York,

14:53.726 --> 14:56.562
the Doctor of Destruction,

14:56.604 --> 14:59.565
<i>the Captain of Crunch,</i>

14:59.607 --> 15:03.027
<i>the Heavyweight Champion
of the World,</i>

15:03.027 --> 15:06.072
<i>Slammin' Cleon Salmon.</i>

15:10.368 --> 15:14.038
Thank you. I hope you find the seafood
to be succulent.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.624
And if you need anything,
anything at all,

15:16.666 --> 15:19.085
remember-- ding--
ring the bell.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.630
And come back soon,
or else I'll ring your bell.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.052
Look at that.
You've been working out.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.137
Let's see. Come here.
Yeah. Okay.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.223
Nuts, I need a drink.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.560
$200 for a babysitter?
I mean, come on, that's a lot of money.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.436
No, you're totally worth it.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.438
I know how much
you love Norah Jones.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.066
I love her too. I bought the tickets.
Front row seats.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.071
"Don't Know Why"?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.282
<i>Round 1.</i>

15:49.323 --> 15:51.909
My God. I've got to go.
I love you.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.579
Well, if it isn't the King of Siam.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.623
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay. Hey, Champ.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.792
Didn't mean to sit in your chair.
Sorry about that.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.294
I'm just being humorous.

16:02.035 --> 16:04.589
But I do want to talk
about something serious.

16:04.589 --> 16:09.093
Are you familiar with
Japanese albino hunting?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.888
Can't say that I am, no.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.432
My God, it is all the rage
in Japan right now.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.767
What they do is they set a bunch
of Japanese albinos

16:16.767 --> 16:18.644
loose in the forest
and you hunt them.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.313
And you shoot them?

16:20.354 --> 16:23.316
No, no, it's just for sport.
Strictly catch and release.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.151
Who is it?!

16:25.568 --> 16:27.236
<i>Round 1.</i>

16:28.571 --> 16:30.031
Your drink, Champ.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.325
Crazy straw.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.327
That's good.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.121
So my first time
hunting these albinos

16:37.121 --> 16:39.290
an albino ran right past me.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.210
I got so nervous
I smacked him in the head

16:42.251 --> 16:44.253
and almost depacitated him.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.466
Whatever, motherfucker!

16:51.977 --> 16:53.246
<i>Round 1.</i>

16:53.346 --> 16:54.639
Now where was I?

16:54.639 --> 16:57.642
You were talking about Japanese
albino hunting.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.144
Yeah. So I bet the head
of the Yakuza

17:00.144 --> 17:02.688
20 grand that I could catch
more albinos than him.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.191
I mean, look at me, come on.
I'm an athlete.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.318
Well, you know what?
I got my ass kicked.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.987
And now I've got to pay him
20 grand by tomorrow.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.490
Sounds like someone
has to go to the ATM machine.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.492
Yeah, you would think that.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.369
But I'm a little cash-poor right now.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.873
I bought some land on the moon
next to John Travolta.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.334
Smart. Real estate
is a very safe investment.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.752
So here's what
you've got to do for me.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.753
I need you to make 20 grand tonight

17:26.796 --> 17:29.340
or else these guys are gonna come
and take the restaurant.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.011
Champ, the most the restaurant has
ever made in one night is 15 grand.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.356
I don't care.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.058
I wish you would have told me.
I would have had more waiters on tonight.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.185
I wish Nino Gutierrez
would have told me

17:41.227 --> 17:44.397
he was gonna sock me with a hard right
in the Fracas in Caracas.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.941
And now look at him.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.196
He's dead.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.090
I can see that.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.909
So figure it out.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.955
If you don't get me 20 grand by tonight
I'm gonna lose the restaurant.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.791
If I lose the restaurant
I'm gonna be mad.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.544
And if I'm mad I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you

18:06.544 --> 18:08.087
and break all your arms.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.256
Champ, I'm gonna need those arms.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.008
I got 3 kids.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.760
All the more reason to keep it open.
Okey-dokey?

18:14.802 --> 18:15.970
Okey-dokey.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.471
I'm gonna skedaddle.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.849
I'll be back to check on you later.

18:23.861 --> 18:25.062
<i>Round 1.</i>

18:25.262 --> 18:26.940
Oh, boy.

18:27.181 --> 18:29.483
Everybody listen up, please.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.694
Hello, everyone listen to me, please.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.696
Champ wants a big night tonight.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.908
So he is offering a prize
to the top selling waiter.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.744
- Is it cash?
- It's not cash, but it's something better.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.787
What, a blowjob from your mother?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
No, no, it's not a blowjob
from my mother, okay?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.627
The prize for the top selling waiter,

18:47.668 --> 18:51.797
2 front row seats to the Norah Jones
concert this week.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.466
My God! I love Norah Jones.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.468
My God.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.678
- Right? Right?
- Sweet, I'm in.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.430
Are you serious?
You like Norah Jones?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.098
No, she's a slag.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.059
But think of all the tang
that's gonna be at that show.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.978
I'll be up to my elbows in tang.
Like a fucking astronaut.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.648
With a space helmet on.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.858
You're a weird fucking dude.
You know that?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.819
I am so gonna win this.
Do tips count?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.696
Tips count.
Champ loves great service, right?

19:15.738 --> 19:19.450
Okay, give me your tips as you get them
and I'll post it up on the board, okay?

19:19.450 --> 19:20.993
- All right.
- Now everyone,

19:21.035 --> 19:23.621
get out there and move some fish.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.957
I've never lost at anything in my life.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.924
Look at this good-looking
group of men.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.844
So are you boys hungry?

19:38.285 --> 19:39.554
Starving.

19:39.971 --> 19:43.432
Well you know what they say
about a man with a big appetite.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.560
It's all true.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.895
Good. 'Cause you know what?

19:47.937 --> 19:50.231
You're gonna have
the 4-lb lobster tonight.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.984
- Okay.
- Okay? And so are you. And you.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.695
I just have to tell you,
I am a huge fan.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.947
"Dogs of the Sahara"
is a perfect movie.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.617
And your acting in it is sick.
Like hospital sick.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.495
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

20:04.537 --> 20:08.249
Seriously, I think you discovered,
like, a new emotion in that movie.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.377
Really? I didn't know.
Thanks again.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.129
Well, what kind of emotion?

20:13.129 --> 20:15.882
Well, you know, it's like
he's like brave

20:15.923 --> 20:17.483
but naïve. You know?

20:17.525 --> 20:19.385
Like braive.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.637
Okay.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.389
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.850
- Sorry, I never do this.
- What's your name, pal?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.144
- I'm Connor.
- Connor, I'm Marlon.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.563
And this is my girlfriend Samara Dubois.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.857
I read "US Weekly."
I know who this is.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
The interior designer
who stole your heart.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.028
That's right.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.363
I hired her to decorate my chill chalet.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.700
She said, "First things first.
You should just call it a 'chilet."'

20:43.242 --> 20:45.495
I fell in love with her
right then and there.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.205
I just put the 2 words together.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.290
Chilet. I love that.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.586
New guy.
Sorry.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.756
- So what's this?
- Little tradition here at the Salmon.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.259
Anytime a busboy breaks something
he does a shot of Blue Curacao.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.470
Is it cool to drink on the job?

21:02.512 --> 21:05.389
Do you need to ask your big brother
for permission?

21:05.389 --> 21:08.100
Do you want to try shaving with this?
Okay, yeah, let's see.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.603
I'm older by 8 hours.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.480
Hi-yaa!

21:12.522 --> 21:14.607
And don't worry.
No one will ever know.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.317
Cool.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.819
- Hey, Conman.
- Mr. Spencer.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.739
I was wondering
if you could help me out.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.242
My God, this is really sudden.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.412
I'm proposing to Samara tonight.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.083
Somebody finally put
a saddle on you, bronco?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.460
Yeah.
When we order dessert,

21:34.460 --> 21:36.587
could you put the ring in it
so she can find it?

21:36.629 --> 21:40.174
Yeah yeah yeah.
Let's get her drunk so she says yes.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.638
That's a custom-made ring, yeah?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.765
It's safe with me.
You have my word.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.183
Cool.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.438
- Send back
- Out of the way. It's a dessert.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.607
- Somebody sent back a dessert.
- My God.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.611
When somebody sends back a dessert
you've got to move fast.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.738
They're like wild jackals
at their mother's teat.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.158
I've got to get lemons.
Tara, will you watch my section?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.994
- Yup.
- This is good!

22:14.667 --> 22:16.752
What's up, Mamma Mia?

22:16.961 --> 22:20.339
The old follow me down
to the walk-in fridge game?

22:22.258 --> 22:26.220
Frankly, I didn't expect to see
you here at the Salmon again.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.515
Yeah, well, I figure I'm here
3 or 4 months tops.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.517
And then I'm moving to California
to do some modeling.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.604
Well, don't you
have to be like tall,

22:34.645 --> 22:37.815
muscular and really hot to model?

22:37.857 --> 22:41.360
No, no, not anymore. You'd be amazed
what they can do with CGI these days.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.196
Right.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.323
I like the new nose, by the way.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.992
It's so funny that you all think that.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.369
'Cause it's the same nose it always was.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.871
Really?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.999
- Want to take a closer look?
- I just might.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.556
- You fucking love it.
- Yeah.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.686
My God! Yes!

23:15.728 --> 23:17.772
- So fucking hot.
- Yeah.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.570
You know what?
I'm not your tickle friend anymore.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.739
Well, you are saying no

23:26.781 --> 23:28.950
but a couple of your friends
are saying yes.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.202
It's cold in here, asshole.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.255
Why do they call you Nuts?

23:42.296 --> 23:44.423
Because I'm crazy.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.842
You don't look crazy.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.010
I'm insane.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.555
You should see me
without my meds.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.057
At my last job,
I didn't take my meds one day,

23:53.057 --> 23:56.185
hour later I was walking around naked
with peanut butter in my hair

23:56.227 --> 23:58.604
telling people my name was Zongo.

23:58.646 --> 24:02.400
I delivered an old lady a cup
of hot water with my balls in it.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.485
Yeah, talk about your Red Zinger.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.822
Yeah, but I don't
remember any of it.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.825
My balls were red though.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.829
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.914
No, I'm joking.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.791
But it is true.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.841
Sir.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.927
Are you ready to order your entree?

24:30.386 --> 24:32.430
I haven't even looked
at the menu.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.932
That's my party people.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.309
Yeah!

24:37.643 --> 24:40.313
Hey, all right.

24:40.354 --> 24:43.357
You've been here for an hour, sir.
Surely you must be hungry.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.152
I am.
I'll take a look.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.572
In the meantime, I'll have a drink.

24:49.614 --> 24:52.825
Tell me, Guy,
what goes well with Tolstoy?

24:52.867 --> 24:55.786
Dom Perignon, Cristal,
perhaps a Chateau Margaux,

24:55.786 --> 24:58.039
or even a 1945 Rothschild.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.041
Well, I'll take all 4.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.293
- Really?
- No.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.795
I'll just have a cup of hot water

25:04.795 --> 25:07.632
with a wedge of lemon.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.635
Living on the edge.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.306
- No, here.
- Hold on, hold on.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.019
Come on.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.482
Jesus.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.275
Nuts, you fucker.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.027
Dick P, a little help?

25:28.069 --> 25:30.780
- What are you guys doing?
- Dicking around, bro.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.241
- Yahtzee!
- What are you doing with the booze?

25:33.282 --> 25:36.702
Donnie, leave us.
Grab me an olive from the bar, please.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.501
Dave Kanogi's brother.
I'm hazing the shit out of him, dude.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.628
Maybe you should be selling
the shit out of the food, dude.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.004
- Tara.
- Yes?

25:47.004 --> 25:48.756
You love Norah Jones.
I mean, "Come Away With Me."

25:48.798 --> 25:50.550
You love that song.
I've heard you humming it.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.385
Yes, I also hum the Macarena.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.428
It doesn't mean I want to go
to the Macarena concert.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.098
- Snap.
- Well, Norah Jones is different.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.517
I mean, she's cool and folksy and jazzy.
Come on.

25:59.517 --> 26:03.229
Rich, look, I'm in medical school, okay?
I don't have time to go to a concert.

26:03.271 --> 26:07.149
- What about you?
- I'm not sure who Norma Jones is.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.860
- Is she the puppeteer?
- No.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.363
Here's the thing. Norah Jones is for
chicks and weepy dorks like you.

26:12.363 --> 26:15.199
If I'm gonna make the Champ richer,
I want a real prize.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.993
Till then, you tell him
to go fuck a cow.

26:16.993 --> 26:19.370
- What's up?
- Snap!

26:27.545 --> 26:29.755
Hey, retards,
you want to answer the phone?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.175
I'll do it.
I'm only the manager.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.512
Good evening.
Persuasions Spa and Casino Resort.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.682
I'm Stanley Bellin.
How may I persuade you?

26:39.724 --> 26:42.852
Hey, Stanley. It's Rich Parente
calling on behalf of Cleon Salmon.

26:42.852 --> 26:46.105
Yeah, the Champ would like to book
his regular suite.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.275
I'm afraid the suite

26:49.317 --> 26:51.527
is not available for Mr. Salmon.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.988
What do you mean? Why not?

26:54.030 --> 26:56.991
'Cause last time
Mr. Salmon's pet kangaroo

26:57.033 --> 26:59.118
defecated in our kitchen.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.787
Well, that kangaroo
is no longer with us.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.749
The Champ actually killed him
during a sparring session.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.584
I'm so sorry to hear that.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.046
Unfortunately I will have to
politely say no.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.797
Is that Stanley?

27:11.839 --> 27:14.634
- Let me talk to him.
- Don't tell him it's me. Just--

27:14.675 --> 27:16.135
Yes, Champ.
It's Stanley Bellin.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.470
Fuck.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.722
Tell him I said I want
the Emperor Suite

27:19.764 --> 27:22.099
or I'm gonna shove his ass
up his ass.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.229
Of course Mr. Salmon
can stay in the Emperor Suite.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.105
I was merely joking.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.108
Tell him to make the reservation
under King Kamehameha.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.736
All right, Kamehameha.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.863
How many Ms?

27:35.905 --> 27:39.033
And it better be free or I'm gonna
knock Stanley into Bolivian.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.328
Yeah, he said that he was
hoping it would be free

27:42.370 --> 27:43.955
or he was gonna knock you
into Bolivian.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.748
But I think he means oblivion.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.750
Whatever, motherfucker!

27:47.750 --> 27:50.419
It'll be free.
It'll be free.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.755
Guys, listen up.
New deal, okay?

27:52.755 --> 27:54.632
Champ is very serious
about selling big tonight.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.759
So there's a new prize.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.845
A 4-day, 3-night stay

27:58.886 --> 28:02.348
at the Persuasions Spa
and Casino Resort Hotel in Key Largo.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.350
- That sounds awesome.
- Really?

28:04.392 --> 28:05.726
Wait a minute, is that the gay key?

28:05.768 --> 28:07.478
It's the straight key, Guy.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.480
What if he wanted the gay key?

28:09.522 --> 28:10.815
Why would I want the gay key?

28:10.857 --> 28:14.026
- I thought you said you...
- All right, listen listen listen.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.611
It's a great prize.
Come on.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.905
Persuasions Spa
and Casino Resort Hotel.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.323
- That's awesome.
- Hell yeah, Dick P.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.367
Here are the current standings, okay?

28:21.409 --> 28:23.828
Nuts, Tara, let's pick it up
a notch, okay?

28:23.828 --> 28:25.163
Enthusiasm!

28:25.204 --> 28:27.832
My suggestion to you guys,
sell the cod.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.750
One of the most expensive
items on the menu.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.836
$38.95, okay?

28:31.878 --> 28:34.046
Let's get out there
and turn 'em and burn 'em.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.298
All right?

28:36.966 --> 28:38.968
Come on, sell some cod.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.596
Well, you have got to try the cod.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.890
Is it fishy?
I don't really like fishy fish.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.350
No, no, no. The cod is
the least fishy of the fishes.

28:46.350 --> 28:50.021
It's so unfishy it's not even
classified as a fish.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.522
I'll take one.

28:53.191 --> 28:56.194
Do yourself a favor,
order the cod.

28:56.194 --> 29:00.031
Is it a fishy fish?
I like my fish fishy.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.782
Cod is definitely
the fishiest fish there is.

29:01.824 --> 29:04.368
And a fishy fish
is a healthy fish.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.872
Did you know that cod
is a flying fish?

29:07.872 --> 29:09.832
It's flying off the shelf tonight.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.168
Is it flakey?
I like flakey.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.295
Very flakey.
The Eskimo name for cod

29:14.295 --> 29:16.923
is actually ponacana
which means flake fish.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.094
It's a rare Moroccan midget cod.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.306
It's almost impossible to catch
so the portions are tiny.

29:25.348 --> 29:26.974
You might want to get 2 per person.

29:27.016 --> 29:29.602
Moroccan midget cod?
I've heard of that.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.229
It's really good.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.814
I usually don't swear at my tables,
but you people look really cool.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.942
So it's fucking delicious.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.944
We'll get fucking 2 each.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.320
Good order.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.406
Hey!

29:44.283 --> 29:48.204
- I've got to ask you something.
- Okay.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.831
Were you on "CFI Hotlanta"?

29:50.373 --> 29:52.667
Yeah, I was.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.043
I knew it.

29:54.085 --> 29:56.212
I said you were on
"The Bachelorette," dude.

29:56.254 --> 29:58.339
Well, they're both good shows,
I suppose.

29:58.381 --> 29:59.841
I love both of those shows.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.968
Hey, Conman,
when you're ready,

30:02.009 --> 30:04.053
I think we're ready for desert.

30:04.095 --> 30:07.431
We'll have a brownie,
one scoop of vanilla ice cream

30:07.431 --> 30:08.933
and 2 spoons.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.310
Carbs.

30:11.352 --> 30:14.564
Yeah, I will get that right out to you.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.818
You know,
oysters are an aphrodisiac.

30:18.860 --> 30:22.738
More oysters,
more aphrodisia.

30:24.657 --> 30:27.660
That is if you guys think
you're gonna get lucky tonight.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.453
I probably will.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.747
What's up, boys?
Did you dirty ho-daddies

30:31.789 --> 30:34.083
wish this perfect angel
a happy birthday yet?

30:35.793 --> 30:37.795
It's your birthday?

30:37.837 --> 30:39.630
Yeah.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.424
Where's your birthday suit?

30:43.134 --> 30:44.760
Stop.

30:44.802 --> 30:48.347
- You're so bad.
- I can be worse.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.812
Donnie, have you ever noticed
that redheaded people

30:54.854 --> 30:56.314
breathe through their mouths?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.149
Like orangutans?

30:58.191 --> 31:00.484
Yeah, exactly like orangutans.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.320
Coincidence?

31:02.320 --> 31:03.863
Happy birthday?

31:03.905 --> 31:05.740
Donnie, leave us.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.493
Bring me a cocktail onion
from the bar, please.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.621
What can I say?
I thought I'd help you get a big tip.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.289
Just like the old days.

31:13.331 --> 31:15.416
And while we're at it...

31:18.336 --> 31:19.712
I accept.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.341
You know,
if you and I work together,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.843
we will definitely win
this Key Largo prize.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.053
No.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.138
Come on, Mia.
Why are you being so difficult?

31:29.180 --> 31:30.765
I want my tickle friend back.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.141
You do?

31:35.645 --> 31:37.438
Rich?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.856
Something's stuck.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.277
Jesus Christ, there was
a diamond ring in that brownie.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.488
It was in the send back area.
It was up for grabs.

31:45.488 --> 31:48.366
- You said it was a send back.
- I said I want my tickle friend back.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.535
What the fuck is a tickle friend?

31:52.662 --> 31:54.956
Cough it up.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.499
Come on!

31:56.541 --> 31:58.584
I'm not choking.
I swallowed it.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.670
Get it out.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.565
Clam chowder for the gentleman.

32:20.565 --> 32:23.109
1, 2, 3.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.905
The salmon and haricots verts
for the lady.

32:27.905 --> 32:31.284
1, 2, 3.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.327
Soup spoon.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.997
1, 2, 3.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.584
Is there anything else
I can get you this evening?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.919
I think we're fine for now.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.546
Thank you.

32:43.588 --> 32:46.048
1, 2, 3.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.052
Enjoy your wine.

32:56.559 --> 32:59.103
Dude, it's heading down to Funkytown.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.771
I can't feel it anymore.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.607
- What is that thing?
- It's a stud finder.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.109
Stud finder?
Sounds like a gay dating service.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.652
Heyoo!

33:06.694 --> 33:08.362
Can we just get the ring, please?

33:08.404 --> 33:10.448
- Tara.
- What?

33:10.490 --> 33:13.201
We need medical help. Rich just swallowed
a really important diamond ring.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.145
Is it still in the esophagus?

33:17.580 --> 33:19.499
Okay, well, it's too deep
to expunge by vomiting.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.584
It could tear the esophageal
tissue on its way up.

33:21.584 --> 33:22.960
After all, it is a diamond.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.670
Hardest substance
known to man!

33:24.712 --> 33:28.633
Look, my advice--
you have to pass it anally.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.469
- Shit.
- Hope it doesn't turn into coal.

33:31.469 --> 33:33.471
Dude, you better pray it doesn't
fork off into your dick.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.181
Ouch.

33:35.223 --> 33:36.807
Nuts, what was with that counting
thing at the table?

33:36.849 --> 33:38.893
Counting?

33:38.935 --> 33:40.353
Did you take your meds today?

33:40.394 --> 33:43.105
Meds? Yeah, 3:30.
Took 'em before I came here.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.775
Next one is at 8:30.

33:45.775 --> 33:47.151
Right now.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.654
Wait, did you account
for daylight savings?

33:49.695 --> 33:52.323
Daylight savings.
No. No.

33:52.365 --> 33:54.450
Well, that means that your body
actually thinks it's 9:30.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.160
You were supposed to take
your meds an hour ago.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.663
Not good.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.749
Okay, look, why don't you take them
and I'll watch your section?

34:01.791 --> 34:03.334
Yeah.

34:03.376 --> 34:05.419
Probably all those cock rings
jangling around in there.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.879
Nuts, Nuts, Nuts,
where are you going?

34:06.921 --> 34:09.465
I've got to get something out
of the coat room. Just take a second.

34:09.507 --> 34:12.510
Can you watch these guy's tables?
I got a diamond ring in me, man.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.097
That's all right.
I'll get it later.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.987
- Was he just skipping?
- What?

34:31.987 --> 34:34.532
- Was he just skipping?
- Pig in a poke.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.074
Let's get back to work.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.744
I think I got a pretty good bead
on a lunch box.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.840
What's up, buddy?

34:50.882 --> 34:53.926
Okay, there's been a bit of a snag.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.261
Okay, what?

34:55.303 --> 34:57.096
Someone ate your engagement ring.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.684
You're fucking with me.
That's good.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.895
No. I put the ring in the brownie

35:03.936 --> 35:06.230
and I turned my back
for just one second

35:06.230 --> 35:08.649
and a member of the staff
ate the brownie.

35:08.691 --> 35:11.527
You stupid cock.
That was a $450,000

35:11.527 --> 35:13.112
South African Bing diamond.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.157
I want to speak to the manager
and the asshole who ate it now.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.285
Did you know some dumb fuck
ate my ring?

35:19.327 --> 35:22.371
Yes, sir.
And I'm terribly sorry about that.

35:22.413 --> 35:23.748
So what are you gonna do about it?

35:23.789 --> 35:25.500
I'm trying to pass it.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.793
- Come again?
- I'm trying to pass it.

35:27.835 --> 35:30.922
Anally.
Coffee, cigarettes, laxatives.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.258
- It was you?
- Yes, it was.

35:34.300 --> 35:38.971
That was a $450,000 South African
Bing diamond you just ate.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.307
Your meal
is on the house tonight.

35:41.349 --> 35:42.600
Screw the meal.

35:42.600 --> 35:46.521
If you don't fuck out that shitting diamond
and fast I'm gonna kick your ass.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.273
And Conster, there will be
a sequel to that.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.195
Como se dice
"Cleveland steamer"?

35:54.237 --> 35:55.780
Don't worry about it.

35:55.822 --> 35:57.657
Yo, Dave.

35:57.698 --> 36:00.117
No, don't even say it.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.494
The woman said it's cold.

36:01.536 --> 36:03.955
- It's steaming.
- I know.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.289
Fucking customers.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.292
I mean, I told her to cook with her ass
and then go fuck herself but she insisted.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.586
I like you, Guy.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.839
Jamie, nuke the dick out of it.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.633
Si, señor.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.937
Hey, what's that blue shit
on your lips?

36:27.979 --> 36:29.272
Nothing.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.607
- Blue Curacao.
- Are you drunk?

36:34.235 --> 36:36.445
Asshole, I got you this fucking job.

36:36.487 --> 36:38.614
You screw this up,
I'm telling Mom.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.658
No!

36:40.700 --> 36:42.785
Come on, Señor Dave, get him!

36:45.454 --> 36:47.999
Get him, Dave.
Come on, man.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.294
I'm gonna stick
your fucking face in the oven.

36:51.294 --> 36:53.129
I fucking hate you!

36:58.509 --> 37:00.136
Come on, señor!

37:00.178 --> 37:02.638
Twins are disgusting, man.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.100
Want me to put your head in the oven?
'Cause I'll do it! I'll do it!

37:06.100 --> 37:08.019
I'm sorry.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.438
The kitchen just told me
we're out of the brownies.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.356
So would you like
the soufflé instead?

37:12.398 --> 37:14.442
It takes an hour to prepare.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.027
I don't think
that we actually need--

37:16.068 --> 37:17.904
- We'll take it.
- Honey.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.989
Now tell me all about your plans
for the living room.

37:20.031 --> 37:22.200
Okay,

37:22.241 --> 37:25.286
where is my boyfriend
and what did you do with him?

37:27.580 --> 37:30.082
Okay, think pillows.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.418
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Starting with the bathtub...

37:33.503 --> 37:35.379
Thank you.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.715
I'm a ballerina, you know?

37:37.757 --> 37:41.469
And I'm putting myself through
the Bilitnikoff Ballet School.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.348
Well, you certainly
got the body for it.

37:45.348 --> 37:48.768
And it stretches in every direction.

37:51.854 --> 37:54.065
Here's a little something extra

37:54.106 --> 37:56.734
for the Sugar Plum Fairy.

37:58.486 --> 38:00.279
Thank you.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.908
What are you looking at, Liz?

38:03.908 --> 38:06.869
- You are so winning this contest.
- Yeah.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.433
Shit!

39:15.188 --> 39:17.273
Don't cry.
It's gonna look fine.

39:17.607 --> 39:19.567
Gently, gently, gently.

39:19.901 --> 39:21.986
This looks all right.
Was this a cream-based soup?

39:22.028 --> 39:23.863
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
I think so.

39:23.905 --> 39:26.699
- Does that make a difference?
- Sometimes.

39:26.741 --> 39:29.660
Okay, well, it looks like
first-degree burns.

39:29.702 --> 39:31.704
It could lead to some
epidermal scarring.

39:31.746 --> 39:35.666
I want you to go home and get some rest
and drink plenty of water.

39:35.708 --> 39:38.753
I am not going home.
I'm in first place.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.088
Hey, that's the spirit, Mia.
Get out there.

39:41.130 --> 39:42.965
What? Rich, no.
Look, she needs to rest

39:42.965 --> 39:45.968
and put some ichthammol
or sulfadiazine on her face.

39:46.010 --> 39:49.514
Yeah, Rich, she needs
ichthioldizine.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.391
Thank you, Donnie.
At least someone here has a heart.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.769
- Thank you.
- All right.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.395
You guys are right.
You're right.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.855
Mia, you should go home.

39:58.981 --> 40:01.651
Did Baryshnikov go home

40:01.692 --> 40:04.445
when he twisted his ankle
at the Bolshoi Festival?

40:04.487 --> 40:05.738
I...

40:06.072 --> 40:09.992
Did Vladimir Putinski walk away
when he sprained his toe

40:09.992 --> 40:12.745
doing "The Marzipan King"
at the Ballet des Elysées?

40:12.787 --> 40:15.498
I'm guessing by your tone, no.

40:15.498 --> 40:19.669
Okay, did Joe Theesman quit baseball
when he broke his leg?

40:20.369 --> 40:22.088
It's actually Joe Theismann,

40:22.129 --> 40:23.548
and he never played football again.

40:23.589 --> 40:27.134
Either way, I am tougher
than you are, motherfucker.

40:28.177 --> 40:30.054
What's that?

40:30.471 --> 40:33.099
No, shit.
Okay, I'll be back.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.102
- Look, Mia, just sit down, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't touch.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.895
The Captain of Crunch,

40:37.895 --> 40:40.982
the Heavyweight Champion
of the World,

40:41.023 --> 40:43.568
Slammin' Cleon Salmon.

40:45.903 --> 40:47.864
You've got to be kidding me.

40:47.864 --> 40:50.783
I am here.
Undefeated, baby.

40:50.825 --> 40:52.952
- The king is here.
- You're number 1.

40:52.994 --> 40:54.871
How you doing?
Come here and give me a hug.

40:55.288 --> 40:56.581
You look good.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.458
Hey, get a carrot for
the SS Fudgealicious, okay?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.419
I assume that's the horse?

41:01.460 --> 41:05.256
Never assume. When you assume
you make an asshole out of yourself.

41:06.799 --> 41:09.093
All right, thank you.
Go back to eating.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.803
Enjoy yourselves.
Forget it. It's not about me.

41:10.845 --> 41:14.390
Hey, Rich, tell Dave
to cook that swordfish.

41:14.432 --> 41:17.310
I won it from Emeril Lagasse
in a thumb-wrestling contest.

41:17.351 --> 41:18.936
I broke this thumb.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.147
He cried like a baby.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.983
Hey, look,
me and Mr. Yamamuri,

41:24.025 --> 41:25.985
we want the best seat
in the house.

41:26.027 --> 41:27.445
We want the royal treatment, Rich.

41:27.445 --> 41:29.030
Champ, you can't.

41:29.071 --> 41:31.782
I mean, we need those tables
if you want to earn the 20 grand.

41:31.824 --> 41:34.494
That's nice, Rich.
Check this out.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.662
If you don't find me a table,

41:36.704 --> 41:40.249
I'm gonna shove him
up your ass.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.711
Champ, isn't he Yakuza?

41:43.794 --> 41:46.589
Come on, man. Don't be racist.
No, he's not Yakuza.

41:46.631 --> 41:50.510
Mr. Yamamuri is gonna make the first
Slammin' Salmon candy bar in Japan.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.553
Check it out-- a layer of chocolate,

41:52.553 --> 41:56.474
nougat, peanut, more nougat
and salmon.

41:56.516 --> 41:58.601
Yeah, I know it sounds nasty,
but trust me.

41:58.643 --> 42:01.145
They love that fish candy
over in the Orient.

42:01.187 --> 42:03.439
Now I'm saying that to say this:

42:03.481 --> 42:06.317
shut the fuck up,
get me a table,

42:06.359 --> 42:09.195
or I'm gonna use your nuts
for cufflinks.

42:09.237 --> 42:11.364
- Coming right up. Great.
- All right.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.241
- Candy bar sounds delicious.
- It is.

42:13.241 --> 42:15.618
- Okay, be right back.
- All right.

42:15.618 --> 42:18.079
You're gonna love this waitress.
She's a ballerina.

42:18.079 --> 42:21.207
Graceful like a swan.
Tell Mr. Yamamuri.

42:23.292 --> 42:24.836
Hey, Champ.

42:27.755 --> 42:30.216
What the fuck happened to you?

42:30.258 --> 42:32.343
I got burned with soup.

42:32.385 --> 42:35.638
Don't you know you're supposed
to blow on it first?

42:35.680 --> 42:36.931
Yes, Champ.

42:36.931 --> 42:39.183
Well, don't just stand there.
Get out of here, soupface.

42:39.225 --> 42:40.643
You're offending
my Tokyokan guest.

42:40.685 --> 42:43.646
- Get me the smart girl.
- Tara?

42:43.646 --> 42:46.482
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get her for you.

42:46.482 --> 42:49.110
And tell her to bring me
some champagne.

42:49.152 --> 42:52.113
I am so sorry, but her soupface
scared the shit out of me.

42:52.113 --> 42:53.823
My voice is not that high.

42:55.992 --> 42:58.911
This says 8 hours.
I need something faster.

42:58.953 --> 43:00.830
I hear eye-drops
work on some people.

43:00.872 --> 43:03.416
One glass of apple juice
and I can fill up a mailbox.

43:03.457 --> 43:06.419
- Yogurt.
- Cheddar cheese.

43:06.460 --> 43:10.339
Tara, the Champ wants you
to wait on him.

43:11.340 --> 43:13.050
Okay.

43:14.093 --> 43:17.388
- Cause of the...
- Yeah. Right.

43:22.018 --> 43:25.479
Mr. Yamamuri say he think
if Muhammad Ali

43:25.521 --> 43:28.024
was still young man
no one ever defeat him.

43:29.525 --> 43:32.028
Yeah, well, if ifs and buts
was candies and nuts,

43:32.069 --> 43:34.113
we'd all have a merry Christmas.
Tell him that.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.369
No, I didn't say that.

43:40.369 --> 43:43.998
If ifs and buts
was candies and nuts,

43:44.040 --> 43:46.334
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

43:46.334 --> 43:47.710
Yes, Champ-san.

43:47.752 --> 43:49.837
- I translate--
- Say it!

43:52.173 --> 43:56.302
If if and but
was candy and nut,

43:56.344 --> 43:58.679
we all have a merry Christmas.

43:58.679 --> 44:01.182
Thank you.
Was that so hard?

44:01.224 --> 44:02.725
Hey, Champ.

44:05.686 --> 44:08.564
Dave, what did you do?
Did you blow Papa Smurf?

44:10.983 --> 44:13.736
Blow Papa Smurf.

44:15.196 --> 44:18.407
We got a couple of stiffs over here.

44:18.449 --> 44:20.243
Champ, would you like
to order some appetizers?

44:20.284 --> 44:22.954
Yes, I would like to order
some encrapments.

44:22.995 --> 44:25.623
I will have the frutti del mare,

44:25.665 --> 44:28.084
the oysters del cabana

44:28.084 --> 44:30.336
and the clams casino.

44:30.378 --> 44:32.755
And for the entree I want
that swordfish that I caught.

44:33.047 --> 44:35.675
And Dave, make sure
you cook the nose too.

44:35.716 --> 44:38.010
I want to see
what that tastes like.

44:38.052 --> 44:39.512
You got that, Dave?

44:39.846 --> 44:42.181
And I want maraschino cherries
on everything.

44:42.223 --> 44:45.101
Did you know
that the word maraschino

44:45.142 --> 44:48.396
came from the boxer
Rocky Maraschino?

44:48.813 --> 44:51.440
It's actually Rocky Marciano.

44:51.482 --> 44:54.402
Whatever, motherfucker!

44:54.402 --> 44:56.737
Okay. Okay. Okay.

44:58.072 --> 45:01.033
How do you say motherfucker
in Spanish?

45:01.075 --> 45:03.536
Most guys go surf 'n' turf.

45:03.578 --> 45:06.455
But I like a guy who goes
surf 'n' surf 'n' turf 'n' turf.

45:06.497 --> 45:08.207
You know, actually,
could you give us a minute?

45:08.249 --> 45:11.919
And we will call you
when we need you.

45:12.837 --> 45:15.381
You men always say you're gonna call.

45:15.423 --> 45:17.425
Okay, actually I'm just trying
to keep my appetite here.

45:17.466 --> 45:19.594
But thank you...

45:19.594 --> 45:21.679
for groping me

45:21.721 --> 45:23.764
and bringing your face
into our dinner.

45:25.433 --> 45:28.311
These are the days I thank God
I have a perfect face.

45:35.026 --> 45:36.402
Sorry.

45:44.660 --> 45:46.537
Hey, you.

45:48.539 --> 45:52.126
So I'm gonna take you up on
your offer about working as a team.

45:53.669 --> 45:55.338
I don't know.

45:55.338 --> 45:57.548
I think I would drag you down.

45:57.590 --> 45:59.091
No.

45:59.133 --> 46:01.427
Best of luck to you.

46:02.762 --> 46:05.264
Get it out of the soup!
Get it out of the soup!

46:05.306 --> 46:07.850
Will somebody please kill this thing?!

46:07.892 --> 46:11.395
He's strong!
He's strong!

46:11.437 --> 46:14.398
What the fuck is taking so long?

46:21.239 --> 46:23.491
You have to dominate
the swordfish.

46:23.533 --> 46:26.244
Only then can you sauté it.

46:26.285 --> 46:28.412
Thanks, Champ.

46:28.454 --> 46:30.414
Rich, numbers!

46:30.414 --> 46:32.750
Here you go.

46:32.792 --> 46:34.126
Are we at 20 grand yet?

46:34.168 --> 46:35.586
We're at 12,000.

46:35.586 --> 46:37.463
That's not even halfway.

46:37.905 --> 46:40.091
- Actually...
- In my office!

46:42.051 --> 46:43.636
Everybody in my office!

46:45.221 --> 46:47.223
No, no, no, not the customers.

46:47.223 --> 46:48.933
You guys sit down.

46:48.975 --> 46:51.352
Wait staff in my office.

47:06.576 --> 47:10.204
So I guess nobody wants
this trip to the Bahamas.

47:10.504 --> 47:13.040
It's actually Key Largo, Champ.
Persuasions.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.335
You know what?
Don't say another word.

47:16.377 --> 47:19.547
'Cause you've proven yourself useless,
wouldn't you say?

47:19.547 --> 47:21.632
Say it.

47:21.674 --> 47:25.887
I am useless with a capital Y.

47:25.887 --> 47:28.139
I am useless

47:28.181 --> 47:30.099
with a capital Y.

47:30.099 --> 47:33.603
That's right.
Now then, when I was in your position,

47:33.644 --> 47:35.897
I would have rabbit-punched
my own mother

47:35.897 --> 47:37.857
for a trip to the Bahamas.

47:39.442 --> 47:41.944
Are you telling me you wouldn't want
to be on a beach right now

47:41.944 --> 47:43.779
sipping on a strawberry daiquiri?

47:43.821 --> 47:46.616
- I would like that very much.
- Well, too bad!

47:46.616 --> 47:49.243
'Cause strawberry daiquiris
are for closers!

47:49.285 --> 47:51.120
Not for pussies!

47:54.081 --> 47:55.500
Hey, numbnuts.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.793
Yeah, Champ?

47:57.835 --> 48:00.463
You're gonna be polishing
my fist with your teeth.

48:01.547 --> 48:03.299
I'll get to you later.

48:03.299 --> 48:06.636
Who is Guy "Meatdrapes"?
What kind of name is that?

48:06.677 --> 48:09.096
It's Metdrapedes, sir.

48:09.096 --> 48:11.098
It's Greek.

48:11.140 --> 48:13.518
Well, I think you're
pronouncing it wrong.

48:13.559 --> 48:15.478
This says "Meatdrapes."

48:15.520 --> 48:18.105
It's actually pronounced
Metdrapedes.

48:18.105 --> 48:20.107
Well, why doesn't it sound
like that when I say it?

48:20.107 --> 48:21.943
"Meatdrapes."

48:21.943 --> 48:24.278
I don't know.

48:24.278 --> 48:26.614
You don't know much,
do you, Guy?

48:26.614 --> 48:28.366
No, sir.

48:28.407 --> 48:30.618
Well, if a trip to the Bahamas

48:30.618 --> 48:33.120
ain't gonna get the molasses
out ya asses,

48:33.120 --> 48:35.623
maybe $10,000 will do the trick.

48:35.665 --> 48:38.000
- What?
- What?

48:38.042 --> 48:40.962
- 10,000 bucks?
- That's right, new prize.

48:40.962 --> 48:44.674
Top waiter leaves here tonight
with 10 grand in his pocket.

48:44.674 --> 48:48.052
Do you know what 10 grand
feels like in your pocket?

48:48.094 --> 48:50.346
It feels like a third cock.

48:50.805 --> 48:53.850
Jesus, how many cocks you got, Champ?

48:55.643 --> 48:57.520
Are you lampooning me,
Meatdrapes?

48:57.562 --> 48:58.855
No, of course not, sir.

48:58.855 --> 49:01.649
- You want a punch in the eye, Guy?
- No, please.

49:01.649 --> 49:03.651
I can make your face
look like a pie, Guy.

49:03.651 --> 49:05.486
God, no.

49:16.998 --> 49:19.208
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to do that.

49:19.250 --> 49:22.044
But now you know the deal.

49:22.044 --> 49:24.297
The waiter that comes in first place

49:24.338 --> 49:26.632
gets $10,000.

49:26.674 --> 49:30.052
Whoever comes in last
gets a broken rib sandwich.

49:30.094 --> 49:32.889
And I wasn't even trying to hurt him.

49:32.930 --> 49:36.267
- Are you about to cry, Guy?
- No, of course not.

49:36.309 --> 49:38.060
Loosen up your tie, Guy.

49:38.102 --> 49:40.313
Did you hear what I just said?

49:40.354 --> 49:42.273
It was a rhyme.

49:42.315 --> 49:45.735
If you're not gonna cry,
then put it in his eye.

49:45.735 --> 49:50.364
Punch to the gut
and make him smell like a skunk.

49:50.406 --> 49:52.992
If he runs out of meat then he's...

50:02.168 --> 50:04.086
So what are you all staring at?

50:04.086 --> 50:06.297
Don't nobody want $10,000?

50:06.339 --> 50:08.966
Get the hell out of here now!

50:11.219 --> 50:12.595
Bullshit, big nose,
it's already over.

50:13.054 --> 50:14.597
Champ,

50:14.639 --> 50:16.599
I don't mean to tell you
your business,

50:16.599 --> 50:19.268
but if you have to make 20 grand
tonight and you give away 10,

50:19.310 --> 50:21.938
it works counter
to what you're trying to do.

50:21.979 --> 50:25.358
Richardo, believe it or not,
I ain't a numbers man.

50:25.399 --> 50:27.443
I punch people for a living.

50:27.485 --> 50:30.780
And I'm gonna punch you
if you don't make that money tonight.

50:30.780 --> 50:33.407
Okay, that's good math.
I'm on it.

50:44.627 --> 50:47.255
- You really mean that?
- Yeah, I do.

50:48.965 --> 50:50.758
That is so cool.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.052
It's that couple's
20th wedding anniversary.

50:53.094 --> 50:56.722
Really? They look so young.

50:56.764 --> 50:58.474
Well, they've been married
since they were 16.

50:58.516 --> 51:00.977
Can you believe?
That's amore.

51:02.019 --> 51:06.023
Gordon, send those kids
a bottle of champagne.

51:06.065 --> 51:07.859
Apparently they've been
married for 10 years.

51:07.900 --> 51:10.653
But she didn't want to get pregnant
until the cancer went into remission.

51:10.695 --> 51:13.781
Well, it went into remission last week.

51:13.823 --> 51:16.659
Will you send them a bottle of your
best champagne? On us, of course.

51:16.701 --> 51:18.578
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

51:18.619 --> 51:20.580
You see that man over there?

51:20.621 --> 51:23.332
He's the one who pulled me
from the burning car.

51:23.332 --> 51:24.834
He's my hero.

51:24.834 --> 51:26.836
After 3 years in a wheelchair,

51:26.836 --> 51:28.838
he walked into her arms.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.549
It was "Oprah"'s highest
rated episode.

51:31.591 --> 51:34.510
And they're sitting right over there.

51:34.510 --> 51:37.972
I am gonna stuff it in your ass tonight.

51:37.972 --> 51:40.808
Well, that's gonna be
an extra 50 bucks.

51:40.808 --> 51:44.020
That's okay.
Shellfish makes me horny.

51:44.061 --> 51:46.814
- Good, 'cause I got crabs.
- Who doesn't?

51:46.814 --> 51:50.276
Excuse me, sir.
Compliments of the house.

51:56.824 --> 51:59.076
What is this, some kind of
hidden camera thing?

51:59.118 --> 52:02.038
- Are you miked?
- Are you miked?

52:02.079 --> 52:04.916
I was just kidding about the anal.

52:06.667 --> 52:08.002
I was just bored at the hotel.

52:08.002 --> 52:10.087
I was looking for something
to do with my cock.

52:10.129 --> 52:12.215
Perfectly natch.

52:12.256 --> 52:15.426
Come on, take a look at her.
You wouldn't kick in that back door?

52:15.468 --> 52:18.095
- I'm not ashamed.
- Fuck this!

52:31.150 --> 52:34.487
Yeah, Guy.
Number 2 with a bullet.

52:34.529 --> 52:37.031
Congratulations.

52:37.031 --> 52:38.449
Burn.

52:38.491 --> 52:41.035
I would like to see you try
and sell with a burnedface,

52:43.371 --> 52:45.832
Sucks to be you, Hiroshima.

52:47.416 --> 52:48.835
10 grand!

52:48.835 --> 52:53.381
I got my eye on a leather couch
with a velvet dick hole in it.

52:53.422 --> 52:54.924
Yeah?
Well, check out the scoreboard.

52:54.966 --> 52:56.884
You got to get by me first,
fake 'n' bake.

52:57.301 --> 52:59.971
- See ya.
- I am going to own this.

53:11.232 --> 53:13.860
Hi there.
Hey.

53:13.901 --> 53:15.903
Is that Norma Jones?

53:15.903 --> 53:17.697
That's Nutella the pop star.

53:17.697 --> 53:19.949
Yeah, you take Norah Jones,
Fergie and Beyoncé

53:19.991 --> 53:21.450
and mix 'em together,
you get Nutella.

53:21.492 --> 53:24.954
Who's Beyoncé?

53:24.996 --> 53:27.999
- Nutella, Nutella.
- There he is.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.834
Good to see you.

53:32.086 --> 53:35.173
Nutella thinks it's always good
to see you too, Champ.

53:35.214 --> 53:36.757
Give 'em the best seat in the house.

53:36.799 --> 53:40.011
Thank you, baby.
Y'all see all that chocolate?

53:40.052 --> 53:42.054
- I know, I love chocolate.
- I heard that.

53:42.096 --> 53:43.556
- Right this way.
- All right.

53:43.556 --> 53:45.933
- Perfect, that table.
- Come on.

53:45.975 --> 53:48.936
- Thank you.
- Yes!

53:48.978 --> 53:51.272
Come on.

53:51.272 --> 53:54.317
- Hey, sexy Patty.
- Hey.

53:54.358 --> 53:56.110
Hey, if you give me the best tables
for the rest of the night

53:56.110 --> 53:57.737
I'll take you to Persuasions
with me.

53:57.778 --> 53:59.614
I thought you were taking Mia.

53:59.655 --> 54:02.450
No, I would rather take you-a.

54:02.492 --> 54:04.577
My God,
you are so funny.

54:04.619 --> 54:05.953
You've got a great sense of humor.

54:05.995 --> 54:07.497
You have great posture.

54:07.497 --> 54:08.956
I used to have scoliosis.

54:08.956 --> 54:11.334
You can't tell.

54:15.254 --> 54:16.714
Good evening, Miss Nutella.

54:16.756 --> 54:20.051
We are so honored
to have you with us tonight.

54:20.092 --> 54:22.970
Can I just say that I love your song

54:22.970 --> 54:25.181
"Too Sincere For You"?

54:25.223 --> 54:28.935
<i>* For you...
It's up here.</i>

54:28.976 --> 54:30.770
Got it.
Nutella thanks you, baby.

54:30.812 --> 54:33.272
Now can we order fast?
'Cause Nutella is hungry.

54:33.314 --> 54:34.899
Of course.

54:34.941 --> 54:36.943
So what should we have?

54:36.984 --> 54:40.988
Well, the Champ ordered
2 bottles of Cristal,

54:41.030 --> 54:43.366
4 lobsters troubadour,

54:43.366 --> 54:45.201
an Alaskan king crab,

54:45.243 --> 54:48.746
oysters carbonara
and a round of swordfish.

54:48.788 --> 54:51.207
Well, we will take 5 of that.

54:51.249 --> 54:53.543
- Fantastic.
- You treat Nutella right,

54:53.584 --> 54:55.378
Nutella treats you right.

54:55.419 --> 54:57.380
- I know what you're saying, girlfriend.
- All right, girl.

54:57.380 --> 55:00.675
- Okay, right.
- Show 'em what you're working with.

55:18.568 --> 55:21.529
Okay, great.
There we go.

55:23.698 --> 55:26.576
No. What?
What are you doing?

55:26.617 --> 55:28.744
- Why am I on the board?
- I am giving you a section.

55:28.786 --> 55:30.872
Congratulations, you are in
the competition.

55:30.913 --> 55:32.331
What are you talking about?
I'm a busboy.

55:32.373 --> 55:35.084
- You were a busboy.
- Get your hands off me.

55:35.126 --> 55:36.627
But now you're a waiter.

55:36.669 --> 55:39.422
No, I don't know the first thing
about waiting tables.

55:39.422 --> 55:41.924
It's very simple.
You ask the people what they want,

55:41.924 --> 55:44.302
and then you bring it to them.
A monkey could do it.

55:44.343 --> 55:47.847
I'm 4 hours behind these guys
and I'm shitfaced.

55:47.889 --> 55:49.682
- Bring those tables out.
- No, no, no!

55:49.724 --> 55:52.059
Great, stick them wherever they fit.

55:52.059 --> 55:53.769
Please don't do this.

55:53.811 --> 55:56.230
Rock shrimp and scallop linguini.

55:56.230 --> 55:59.025
Stay close to the shitter.
I call it my pants down pasta.

55:59.066 --> 56:00.943
Be sure to eat all the cream.
Hey, douchebag.

56:00.985 --> 56:03.654
Dave, you've got to tell the guy
I'm a fuck-up, yeah?

56:03.696 --> 56:06.240
No, no, no, you'll do great.
You made it through 6 months of college.

56:06.282 --> 56:08.826
- Come on, Dave.
- Sounds like waiter material to me.

56:08.868 --> 56:10.786
This is delicious.

56:10.828 --> 56:14.707
I hope the Champ knocks every tooth
out of your fucking head.

56:14.749 --> 56:16.792
I hope the Champ
knocks your tooth out.

56:24.425 --> 56:27.345
Shots, shots, shots.
Come on, get it into ya.

56:30.389 --> 56:33.142
Hello, gentlemen,
and welcome to the Salmon Slammin'.

56:33.184 --> 56:36.562
My name is Donnie. Can I start you off
with something to drink tonight?

56:36.604 --> 56:39.190
We've already got some drinks,
haven't we, mate?

56:39.232 --> 56:41.192
Sounds like you're from the UK.

56:41.234 --> 56:44.612
Are you in a band like Oasis
or Herman's Hermits?

56:44.612 --> 56:47.281
No, we're not.

56:47.323 --> 56:50.159
Are there any answers I can question
you from the menu tonight?

56:50.201 --> 56:53.496
All right, Donnie, why don't you tell us
something good on the menu?

56:53.538 --> 56:55.456
Well, the Blue Curacao
is excellent.

56:56.165 --> 56:57.667
Private joke.

56:57.708 --> 57:00.002
Just get us some more shots, all right?

57:00.002 --> 57:02.630
Then I will just clear these shot glasses
out of the way for you.

57:02.672 --> 57:04.799
Hey, hey!

57:09.387 --> 57:11.639
You fucking cunt.

57:11.639 --> 57:14.475
I'm not drunk.

57:27.572 --> 57:29.866
So how is everything tonight?

57:30.366 --> 57:33.035
Truly splendid, Guy.
Thank you.

57:33.077 --> 57:35.621
Well, we're really really busy tonight.

57:35.663 --> 57:37.540
Yes, I can see that.

57:37.582 --> 57:40.084
So is there anything else I can get
for you tonight

57:40.126 --> 57:42.336
or just the check?

57:42.336 --> 57:45.006
Well, I wouldn't mind a cup of tea.

57:45.006 --> 57:48.551
Get the fuck out of here.

57:48.593 --> 57:50.678
Excuse me?

57:50.678 --> 57:52.180
Are you reading
"War and Peace"?

57:52.221 --> 57:53.556
Get the fuck out of here.
I love that book.

57:53.598 --> 57:56.893
Well, perhaps you'd like
to come to my book club.

57:56.893 --> 58:01.230
Yeah, last week we read
Flaubert's "Madame Bovary."

58:01.230 --> 58:03.441
It really brought the...

58:04.083 --> 58:05.535
house down.

58:05.735 --> 58:06.970
Hey, kid.

58:08.012 --> 58:09.105
I like you.

58:09.246 --> 58:11.115
I think they put you
in a really tough situation.

58:11.157 --> 58:13.201
I'm gonna help you out
and give you one of my tables.

58:13.242 --> 58:14.952
Really? Thanks.

58:14.994 --> 58:17.205
Yeah, see Donald Trump over there?

58:19.207 --> 58:21.042
Knock yourself out.

58:24.837 --> 58:26.339
Connor.

58:26.672 --> 58:28.758
I just sat you a 6.

58:28.799 --> 58:30.218
6.

58:30.259 --> 58:32.011
Thanks, Patty.

58:34.972 --> 58:37.725
So you just keep whacking him
in the knee.

58:39.769 --> 58:42.230
Painful, but better
than a punch in the face.

58:48.736 --> 58:52.031
- Connor?
- Hey, Morgan.

58:52.031 --> 58:54.534
Hi.

58:54.534 --> 58:56.452
You remember Dick Lobo,

58:56.494 --> 58:58.913
- the producer of "CFI Hotlanta."
- Hey.

58:59.163 --> 59:00.540
Of course.

59:00.540 --> 59:02.500
And the entire rest of the cast.

59:02.542 --> 59:05.253
Yeah, Ron, Mary Kay, Jojo.

59:06.153 --> 59:07.922
What are you guys doing here?

59:07.964 --> 59:10.925
We're in town to shoot
this fabulous crossover promo

59:10.967 --> 59:12.301
with "CFI Miami."

59:12.343 --> 59:13.845
Cool.

59:13.886 --> 59:16.097
You know, somebody suggested
that if I was in Miami

59:16.138 --> 59:17.598
this is the place to come.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.433
That was me.

59:19.433 --> 59:21.936
Right.
Right.

59:21.936 --> 59:24.063
Yeah, so what are you doing here?

59:24.105 --> 59:26.732
You researching a role
for TV or something?

59:26.732 --> 59:28.526
Not really.

59:28.568 --> 59:31.237
I actually just work here.
So...

59:31.237 --> 59:33.281
Keeping it real.

59:34.031 --> 59:37.368
- Good for you, dog.
- All right. Okay.

59:38.911 --> 59:42.081
So can I get you all started off

59:42.123 --> 59:44.292
with something to drink?

59:44.333 --> 59:48.629
I told myself
I wasn't going to put

59:48.671 --> 59:53.259
my thumbprint
into every dessert

59:53.259 --> 59:54.760
and yet...

59:57.555 --> 59:59.390
That's impossible.

59:59.432 --> 01:00:01.309
I never touched that one.

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:02.810
You know you're gonna
have to start over now.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.145
I know.

01:00:05.229 --> 01:00:07.899
I told myself
I wasn't going to put...

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.734
This is undefeated, you are--

01:00:09.775 --> 01:00:11.819
should be depleted.

01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:13.446
When you go against me

01:00:13.446 --> 01:00:16.032
you're gonna
be needing a paramedic.

01:00:16.073 --> 01:00:18.993
P-a-r-a-dic.
Paramedic.

01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:24.165
Zongo's in the house!

01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:35.510
Hey, he's onto something.

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:37.136
You guys see Nuts?

01:00:37.178 --> 01:00:40.515
I want all the wait staff
skipping just like Nuts now.

01:00:42.517 --> 01:00:45.520
God damn it, I said now!
Skip!

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.022
Skip, everybody!

01:00:48.022 --> 01:00:50.274
Keep skipping.
Keep skipping.

01:00:50.316 --> 01:00:52.026
If you're in one place,
hop up and down.

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:54.862
- There you go, man.
- You doing all right?

01:00:54.862 --> 01:00:58.533
Skip it like you mean it!
Keep skipping!

01:00:58.533 --> 01:00:59.992
What the fuck?

01:00:59.992 --> 01:01:03.412
<i>* Tempura</i>

01:01:03.454 --> 01:01:06.749
<i>* It's delicious.</i>

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.129
That's great.

01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.215
I love it.
We'll take all of it.

01:01:14.257 --> 01:01:16.425
- Nuts, Nuts, come here.
- Tara, Tara, Tara.

01:01:16.467 --> 01:01:19.387
Rich, he's over the edge.
We have to help him.

01:01:19.387 --> 01:01:21.013
Let it slide.
He's selling like crazy.

01:01:21.013 --> 01:01:24.100
- You don't care?
- I totally care.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.104
Rich, look at him.
He's totally out of control.

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:30.356
That doesn't bother you?

01:01:30.356 --> 01:01:33.276
- Keep up the good work, okay?
- Rich, come on. Something's wrong.

01:01:33.317 --> 01:01:35.069
If you need anything
ask for Zongo.

01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:38.447
In second place is Connor.

01:01:38.489 --> 01:01:41.826
And in first place, Nuts/Zongo.

01:01:41.868 --> 01:01:43.870
- Nuts is in first? Jesus Christ.
- What?

01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:46.122
Rich, he's bazonkers.
Get him off the floor.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.583
- Yeah.
- Look, aren't we all a little bazonkers?

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.127
Rich, why are you doing this?
Is it because of the Champ?

01:01:51.169 --> 01:01:53.045
That's ridiculous.
We have a job to do.

01:01:53.045 --> 01:01:54.922
Nuts and Zongo should at least count
as 2 different people.

01:01:54.964 --> 01:01:56.048
- I agree.
- Yes.

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:58.634
Look, if it's any consolation,
you're all really close together.

01:01:58.676 --> 01:02:00.595
Except for you, Donnie.

01:02:02.638 --> 01:02:05.057
My God. Excuse me.
I've got to go.

01:02:08.102 --> 01:02:11.272
- Got to be an asshole about this.
- I ain't losing to some lunatic.

01:02:13.149 --> 01:02:15.568
If you don't like mauve we can totally
do some kind of texture

01:02:15.568 --> 01:02:17.111
mosaic finger-painting.

01:02:17.153 --> 01:02:18.946
Excuse me.

01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:21.365
I just wanted to let you know
that the chef

01:02:21.407 --> 01:02:23.409
is pushing out

01:02:23.409 --> 01:02:26.120
your dessert from the oven.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.372
It'll just be a few minutes.

01:02:28.372 --> 01:02:32.502
Well, that is fantastic,
Detective Shep Winford.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:35.213
Now why don't you track me
down another drink?

01:02:35.254 --> 01:02:37.632
And tell them to put some
booze in it this time, yeah?

01:02:37.632 --> 01:02:39.634
Coming right up.

01:02:39.634 --> 01:02:41.511
- Are you sure you want another one?
- Yes.

01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:43.471
Maybe a virgin rum and Coke.

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:46.557
- That would just be Coke.
- That sounds delicious.

01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:48.518
What's up, noodle dicks?

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:51.521
That table over there just ordered
2 rounds of premium tequila.

01:02:51.562 --> 01:02:53.064
Now are y'all just gonna sit here

01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:55.191
while they make you look like
a bunch of fucking pussies?

01:02:55.233 --> 01:02:57.652
Hell no, dude.
We'll take 3 rounds.

01:02:57.652 --> 01:02:59.070
Shit yeah!
What are y'all, Phi Taus?

01:02:59.111 --> 01:03:01.697
- Phi Taus!
- Come on now, give it to me.

01:03:01.739 --> 01:03:03.533
- Give it to me good.
- Let's take him down.

01:03:03.533 --> 01:03:07.078
- I know where he keeps his meds.
- Yeah.

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:09.413
I want some booze
in my belly.

01:03:09.455 --> 01:03:11.207
Yeah, baby!

01:03:11.207 --> 01:03:14.043
Fidel, this is for a pissed-off movie star,
so give it some balls.

01:03:15.503 --> 01:03:17.046
Yeah. Do it.

01:03:17.046 --> 01:03:20.007
Go and go.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:20.007 --> 01:03:21.801
Hola, diablo blancos.

01:03:21.843 --> 01:03:24.262
Zongo like vodka.

01:03:24.303 --> 01:03:26.722
Hey. hey, you doing okay, Zongo?

01:03:27.765 --> 01:03:29.559
Hello, Zongo.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.394
You've got to take it, Zongo.

01:03:31.394 --> 01:03:34.021
Nobody puts Zongo in a cage.

01:03:34.021 --> 01:03:37.692
No one's trying
to put Zongo in a cage, Zongo.

01:03:37.692 --> 01:03:40.611
Okay.
I'll take it.

01:03:40.653 --> 01:03:43.281
- It's so big!
- Get him!

01:03:49.036 --> 01:03:51.414
Zongo, calm down.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:05.928
What the fuck?

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.264
Hey, Mr. Lobo.

01:04:08.306 --> 01:04:10.850
- Men's room?
- Just down the hall.

01:04:10.892 --> 01:04:13.603
Miami.

01:04:13.644 --> 01:04:15.730
Open. There.

01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:18.608
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Got it. Got it.

01:04:18.649 --> 01:04:20.902
Easy. Easy, Zongo.
Easy.

01:04:21.319 --> 01:04:23.529
Easy. That's good.

01:04:23.529 --> 01:04:26.282
- That's good.
- Get him up.

01:04:30.036 --> 01:04:32.288
Hey, you look better.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:33.915
Yeah, I'm better now.

01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:36.751
I am gonna win this thing,
face or no face.

01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:40.046
Got a birthday table and I've got
'em in the palm of my hand.

01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:43.049
- So you want to sing with me?
- Yes, I do.

01:04:43.049 --> 01:04:45.718
Get your poop in a group.

01:04:48.513 --> 01:04:51.557
- Any second now.
- Believe it when I see it.

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:00.024
Sorry.

01:05:03.402 --> 01:05:04.904
Shit.

01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:06.614
Connor, hey.

01:05:06.656 --> 01:05:08.866
Mr. Lobo, I just need
a minute of your time

01:05:08.908 --> 01:05:10.409
to talk about why you fired me.

01:05:10.451 --> 01:05:13.996
Connor, please.
I don't know what you're taking about.

01:05:14.038 --> 01:05:16.332
It's okay, I understand.

01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:18.292
I mean, you cast me
to play a big-nosed cop

01:05:18.292 --> 01:05:20.628
and I got a nose job.
It was stupid.

01:05:20.628 --> 01:05:22.547
I didn't even know
you had a nose job.

01:05:22.588 --> 01:05:24.590
Looks pretty good though.
Turn your head that way.

01:05:24.632 --> 01:05:26.634
Yeah. Who's your doctor?

01:05:26.634 --> 01:05:29.011
I've got a 12-year old daughter
with a fucking beak.

01:05:29.053 --> 01:05:31.848
She's got bean bag tits
and a big caboose too.

01:05:31.889 --> 01:05:34.225
That poor girl's gonna have
a hard road ahead.

01:05:34.267 --> 01:05:36.185
Mr. Lobo, I know I made a mistake.

01:05:36.227 --> 01:05:39.272
Look, kid, I didn't fire you
for having a small nose.

01:05:39.313 --> 01:05:42.316
Mr. Lobo, I am not gonna
turn you in to the nose police.

01:05:42.358 --> 01:05:44.318
You kill me, man.

01:05:44.318 --> 01:05:47.238
It was hard
growing up with that nose.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.241
You are a real fucking moron,
you know that?

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:52.994
- What?
- You read the script, didn't you, shithead?

01:05:52.994 --> 01:05:56.455
It's all nose jokes.
"I've been nosing around. I smell a rat."

01:05:56.455 --> 01:05:58.833
And then you show up
with that little cat nose.

01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:00.626
Doesn't make any sense.

01:06:00.626 --> 01:06:03.171
Do you realize how hard it is
to rewrite an entire season?

01:06:03.212 --> 01:06:05.965
- No, sir.
- You were a kid with a big nose.

01:06:05.965 --> 01:06:08.217
You got on TV
but you fucked it up.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:11.179
You. Who?
You fucked it up.

01:06:13.139 --> 01:06:15.600
Look, Mr. Lobo, I found out
about this place

01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.894
that does nose enlargements.

01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:21.397
And if all goes well I could actually
have the money to do it by tomorrow.

01:06:22.899 --> 01:06:26.944
The new honker is gonna
be a goddamn fire hose.

01:06:26.986 --> 01:06:28.613
What are we supposed to do?

01:06:28.654 --> 01:06:33.034
Bring back Detective Shep Winford
from the dead with a big nose?

01:06:33.075 --> 01:06:34.952
This isn't fucking "X Files."

01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:40.333
Goodbye.

01:06:42.293 --> 01:06:46.005
So you didn't donkey punch
Morgan Fairchild.

01:06:46.506 --> 01:06:48.257
Jesus Christ.

01:06:58.726 --> 01:07:02.814
Hey, wasn't I in last place
an hour ago?

01:07:02.855 --> 01:07:04.315
Yes, you were.

01:07:04.357 --> 01:07:07.235
- Was Zongo here?
- Zongo was here all right.

01:07:07.276 --> 01:07:09.779
Sold 18 entrees to a party of 6.

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.681
I don't remember any of that.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:13.699
Not even the Champ
offering 10 grand?

01:07:13.699 --> 01:07:16.702
- 10 grand for what?
- Top seller.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:24.169
Fucking dodo bird.

01:07:44.313 --> 01:07:45.648
Nuts?

01:07:46.482 --> 01:07:48.068
Are you okay?

01:07:49.468 --> 01:07:50.988
I am Zongo.

01:07:53.823 --> 01:07:55.783
I am still going to win this contest

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:58.327
because I can hold it together
under pressure.

01:07:58.369 --> 01:08:00.997
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:02.957
Be graceful and amazing

01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:04.959
'cause that's what I am.

01:08:07.712 --> 01:08:09.046
Donnie?

01:08:09.964 --> 01:08:12.800
Who the fuck is Donnie?

01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:15.511
I'm Donnie, Mr. Salmon.

01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:18.055
Good try, Dave.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:21.642
No, I'm Dave's twin brother.

01:08:22.727 --> 01:08:24.228
And you know what?
Another thing,

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.647
I don't care how severe
her peanut allergy is.

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:30.859
Did anybody ever tell you
you guys look exactly alike?

01:08:30.902 --> 01:08:32.045
Every day.

01:08:32.187 --> 01:08:34.406
Is that why you wear the blue lipstick?

01:08:34.947 --> 01:08:37.158
Either way,
I hope you like hospital food.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.578
No, I was recently a busboy.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.247
- I wasn't a part of this thing.
- Yeah, you know what?

01:08:43.288 --> 01:08:46.709
Excuses are like assholes.
Everybody's got one,

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:49.002
but don't nobody want to admit it.

01:08:49.502 --> 01:08:52.665
Now get your ass out of last place

01:08:52.865 --> 01:08:55.551
or I'm gonna use
your spine for a jump rope.

01:08:59.388 --> 01:09:00.890
What the fuck?

01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:05.185
I'd still hit that.

01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:12.819
- I got it.
- Nice.

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:17.198
Dude, where's the South African
Bing diamond?

01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:21.118
Shit!

01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:27.750
Ladies, hello and welcome
to the Slammin' Salmon tonight.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:31.295
Let me tell you about some of the more
delicious things on our menu.

01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:34.881
We have a boneless fillet of...

01:09:37.584 --> 01:09:39.104
champion--

01:09:39.804 --> 01:09:43.057
also a very nice black eye--

01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:48.813
sock-eyed salmon.
It's very nice.

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:53.109
It's sautéed...

01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:55.027
heartbeat...

01:09:57.196 --> 01:09:59.240
He's watching me.

01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:19.510
Little story for you, Dave II,
before you get back to work.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.014
When I was training
for the Dispute in Beirut,

01:10:23.055 --> 01:10:26.726
I used to run 10 miles a day with
a baby camel strapped to my back.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.689
So you can understand
how bemusing I find it

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:33.399
that you're trying
to run away from me.

01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.817
I was...

01:10:35.651 --> 01:10:38.321
Don't run. Just take it.

01:10:42.909 --> 01:10:44.744
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

01:10:44.785 --> 01:10:46.871
Here's to "CFI Hotlanta"

01:10:46.913 --> 01:10:50.041
and its record 15 Emmy Award
nominations.

01:10:50.124 --> 01:10:51.834
- Yay.
- Hear hear.

01:10:55.186 --> 01:10:56.288
Connor.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.365
Come here.
Come here a second.

01:10:58.565 --> 01:11:00.927
Come here.

01:11:02.678 --> 01:11:05.598
Hey, buddy, we couldn't have done it
without you, man.

01:11:05.598 --> 01:11:07.809
- Hear hear.
- Hear hear.

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.544
Thanks a million.

01:11:09.785 --> 01:11:12.271
Connor, have you met
our newest cast member?

01:11:12.313 --> 01:11:13.815
This is Steve Lemmaduche.

01:11:15.441 --> 01:11:17.151
Hey, buddy.
What's crackin'?

01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:19.278
Call me Duche.

01:11:20.863 --> 01:11:23.324
Hey, what are those guys
eating over there?

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:26.494
Over there?
That's the salmon.

01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:30.665
Yeah.
That smells beautiful.

01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:32.333
Hustle me out one of those.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.961
And a chocotini, dry.

01:11:35.202 --> 01:11:36.379
Thanks, pal.

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.839
The Duche.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.741
Connor.

01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:43.511
Look, I just know you're gonna
find another show really soon.

01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:45.080
Thank you, Morgan.

01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:49.809
And that being said, I also know
that I ordered my ahi tuna seared,

01:11:49.809 --> 01:11:52.311
and, baby, this is not seared.

01:11:52.353 --> 01:11:55.481
I'll get that right back to you.

01:11:55.481 --> 01:11:57.525
Thank you.

01:12:05.741 --> 01:12:09.203
Donnie?
What are you doing?

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:12.874
Are you crying?

01:12:12.915 --> 01:12:14.876
No.

01:12:15.877 --> 01:12:19.130
What is that?
It's not coming off.

01:12:19.172 --> 01:12:21.090
The Champ is gonna kill me.

01:12:21.132 --> 01:12:23.176
There's no way I can get
out of last place.

01:12:23.217 --> 01:12:25.011
Donnie, he's not gonna kill you.

01:12:25.011 --> 01:12:28.055
Didn't you hear?
Last place is a broken rib sandwich.

01:12:28.097 --> 01:12:31.434
You see? Breaking your ribs
won't kill you.

01:12:33.519 --> 01:12:36.439
Okay, Look, Donnie, why don't you
take one of my tables?

01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:38.524
The McNaultys.
They're great tippers

01:12:38.524 --> 01:12:41.068
and they've got a huge check.
My gift to you.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:43.070
Shut up.
You need that money for school.

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.656
Nutella's check is over $1,000.

01:12:45.698 --> 01:12:48.034
Once I close her out,
I'm gonna shoot past everyone.

01:12:48.034 --> 01:12:50.077
Take the table.

01:12:50.119 --> 01:12:52.622
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:12:52.663 --> 01:12:56.083
- How would I pay you back?
- I don't know.

01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:59.420
Take me out for a broken rib
sandwich sometime.

01:12:59.921 --> 01:13:01.923
Help me up.

01:13:01.964 --> 01:13:03.549
Come on, you lush.

01:13:08.554 --> 01:13:10.890
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:12.433
My name is Zongo.

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:15.102
How is everyone feline this evening?

01:13:16.562 --> 01:13:20.066
The '62 salmon is "purrfect."

01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.360
Would anybody like to try?

01:13:23.903 --> 01:13:26.405
Yes.
Everybody take a sip.

01:13:26.948 --> 01:13:28.449
Delicious.

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:31.619
How about you, ma'am?
How does that taste?

01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:34.247
How does that taste?
How does that taste?

01:13:34.247 --> 01:13:35.715
How does that taste?

01:13:35.915 --> 01:13:38.217
How does that taste?

01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:40.837
How does that taste?
How does it taste?

01:13:40.878 --> 01:13:42.805
How does it taste?
How does that taste?

01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:44.699
How does it taste?

01:13:54.066 --> 01:13:57.270
Definitely the hardest
substance known to man.

01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:02.316
So good.

01:14:14.245 --> 01:14:15.705
My God.

01:14:16.038 --> 01:14:18.666
- I love it.
- I'm glad you like it.

01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:20.418
Yes.

01:14:20.459 --> 01:14:22.545
Yes, I'll marry you.

01:14:28.259 --> 01:14:31.804
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, baby.

01:14:31.846 --> 01:14:33.848
- Tara, Tara, Tara.
- What?

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:35.308
Can you go check on Nuts, please?

01:14:35.308 --> 01:14:36.809
Why do I have to do it?
Rich, I'm slammed.

01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:38.352
'Cause you're a doctor, come on.

01:14:38.352 --> 01:14:40.646
I'm not even close to being a doctor.
I'm a second-year med student.

01:14:40.646 --> 01:14:42.315
I'm making half of this shit up.

01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:44.317
Come on, isn't it part
of your Hippocrastic Oath?

01:14:44.358 --> 01:14:47.195
Hippo what?
Look, don't put this on me, okay?

01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:49.363
He got punched out
by that gigantic mongoloid

01:14:49.405 --> 01:14:51.324
because you
denied him his medication.

01:14:51.324 --> 01:14:54.660
You sold him out just like you sold out
Mia and that poor kid Donnie.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.038
And all because you're afraid of Cleon.

01:14:57.038 --> 01:14:59.248
God, you're a real
spineless pussy, Rich.

01:15:01.459 --> 01:15:04.670
Hey, 3 of them.

01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:06.214
Jesus.

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:08.174
Look at these babies.

01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:11.385
- Honey, hi.
- Hey.

01:15:11.427 --> 01:15:12.762
What are you doing here?

01:15:12.804 --> 01:15:15.723
Well, the kids couldn't sleep
so I thought we'd pop in and say hi.

01:15:15.765 --> 01:15:18.643
Mrs. Rich Parente in the house.

01:15:18.643 --> 01:15:20.061
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.147
Cleon.

01:15:23.147 --> 01:15:26.150
I don't mean to be mean,
but, baby, you need some Listerine.

01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:30.905
That's my little sister.
Always tells it like it is.

01:15:31.531 --> 01:15:33.574
Look at the little babies.

01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:35.868
Hey, it's Uncle Cleon.

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.204
Damn, they all look the same.

01:15:38.204 --> 01:15:40.873
What'd you do,
fuck a Xerox machine?

01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:43.543
Watch your goddamn mouth
in front of my kids.

01:15:43.584 --> 01:15:45.878
- It's Uncle Cleon. Watch it.
- No, no, not too close.

01:15:45.878 --> 01:15:48.506
- Okay, easy now. Okay.
- Keep your guard up.

01:15:48.506 --> 01:15:51.509
How the hell did you wind up
with the Champ's sister?

01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.886
Well, believe it or not,

01:15:53.886 --> 01:15:56.264
the Champ introduced us
and we fell in love

01:15:56.305 --> 01:15:59.725
and had these babies.
And here we are.

01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:03.229
When I first was made aware
of Richardo here,

01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:05.857
he cracked his head open
running out of my office.

01:16:05.857 --> 01:16:08.234
And I thought right away,
this guy

01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:10.069
is such a pussy.

01:16:10.903 --> 01:16:13.030
I knew he was such a pussy

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.825
that he would never
ever cheat on my sister.

01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:17.785
No, I'm serious.

01:16:17.827 --> 01:16:20.037
You want to know what
my nick name for him was?

01:16:20.537 --> 01:16:22.540
Cunty McTwat.

01:16:22.582 --> 01:16:24.250
'Cause he was such a pussy.

01:16:27.203 --> 01:16:30.047
Why isn't anybody laughing?

01:16:30.089 --> 01:16:32.550
- That's amazing.
- Hey, babies, yes.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.427
The middle one has your head.

01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:35.845
Don't touch-- No, no, no.
Okay.

01:16:38.055 --> 01:16:39.849
Okay, we've got some movement,
you guys.

01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:44.187
This is bullshit!

01:16:44.228 --> 01:16:47.607
You gave Donnie
all of Nuts's huge tables.

01:16:47.648 --> 01:16:49.108
Guy, it's anyone's game still, all right?

01:16:49.108 --> 01:16:51.444
There's only 250 bucks
separating first and last.

01:16:51.486 --> 01:16:53.488
- It's anyone's game.
- That's awesome.

01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:55.281
You better not be lying,
'cause I will cut you.

01:16:55.281 --> 01:16:57.783
All right, one hour left.
Go get 'em, guys, all right?

01:16:57.825 --> 01:17:00.286
- Okay okay.
- Mia Mia Mia.

01:17:00.286 --> 01:17:02.079
I just sat the last table.
You got 'em.

01:17:02.079 --> 01:17:05.583
It's the Miami Dolphin's offensive line
and they're starving.

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:08.836
Good luck.
Sorry, but, you know...

01:17:08.878 --> 01:17:10.505
This is so not over.

01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:14.091
- You're gonna burn, baby.
- I'm not losing this thing.

01:17:14.133 --> 01:17:15.635
I'm not losing this thing.

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.429
All right, if you ladies are like me,

01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:20.223
you can eat a shitload of lobster.

01:17:20.264 --> 01:17:23.267
I am not leaving
until you people are heaving.

01:17:23.309 --> 01:17:26.312
So that's 4 orders
of the Alaskan king crab legs.

01:17:27.855 --> 01:17:29.525
Eat it, fuck nut.

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:36.697
Hey, how are you?

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:38.991
I couldn't help but overhear
you ordered the king crab.

01:17:39.033 --> 01:17:42.119
Well, we came in here dead set
on the San Francisco cioppino,

01:17:42.161 --> 01:17:46.123
but that young lad made those
king crab legs sound irresistible.

01:17:46.165 --> 01:17:48.417
It's just that you look like good people.

01:17:48.459 --> 01:17:51.420
And the chef asked us not
to sell the king crab

01:17:51.462 --> 01:17:54.882
because... it's a week old.

01:17:54.924 --> 01:17:58.511
Why would that waiter recommend
something that's turned?

01:17:58.553 --> 01:18:00.847
It's one of the most expensive
items on the menu.

01:18:00.888 --> 01:18:04.350
You can figure it out.
But please, you didn't hear it from me.

01:18:04.392 --> 01:18:07.186
My name is Guy.

01:18:07.186 --> 01:18:10.314
I like him more.
That's the man I trust.

01:18:13.067 --> 01:18:16.946
Hi, guys.
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.282
My name is Mia
and I'll be your waitress.

01:18:19.323 --> 01:18:21.826
I apologize for my appearance,

01:18:21.826 --> 01:18:24.287
but I was in an explosion.

01:18:24.328 --> 01:18:26.080
Is this like Make a Wish Foundation?

01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:28.124
Yes, definitely.

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:29.876
That's great.

01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:33.379
What a brave lady. I mean,
showing your face in public like this.

01:18:33.421 --> 01:18:35.214
- Thank you.
- Tell you what, Mia,

01:18:35.214 --> 01:18:38.426
we're starving, so would you start
us off with some appetizers?

01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:40.720
Of course.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.264
We'll take 2 t-bone steaks.
2 each.

01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:46.058
- 2 each.
- Okay.

01:18:46.058 --> 01:18:47.977
Put some calamari on there.

01:18:48.019 --> 01:18:50.438
Good luck on your nose job.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.023
Thank you, Mr. Lobo.

01:18:52.064 --> 01:18:53.608
Give me a call
when the bandages come off.

01:18:53.649 --> 01:18:56.611
- Okay.
- We're doing "CFI Greektown."

01:18:56.652 --> 01:19:00.239
You might be right for
Detective Stavros Popadropolis.

01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:02.742
- Okay.
- Feel like I'm gonna give birth.

01:19:02.783 --> 01:19:04.243
Thank you, Mr. Lobo.

01:19:04.243 --> 01:19:07.455
Thank you, Connor.
It's so good to see you again.

01:19:07.455 --> 01:19:09.207
Great to see you too, Morgan.
You look terrific.

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:12.460
- Thank you.
- Hey, man, you're a hell of a waiter.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.546
Don't quit your day job.
Boop.

01:19:15.588 --> 01:19:18.132
Get lost.

01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:21.636
Enjoy not winning
10 grand, sucker.

01:19:21.928 --> 01:19:23.971
Honey, that's so cute.

01:19:24.013 --> 01:19:27.975
But I still have Nutella and, whew,
it is a huge check.

01:19:27.975 --> 01:19:30.269
Don't worry though.
When I'm done with school

01:19:30.269 --> 01:19:32.814
I'll fix your nose for free.
Any shape you want, okay?

01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:35.316
Button nose, cute little clown nose.

01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:38.110
A brown nose.
That works well for you.

01:19:43.616 --> 01:19:47.995
And I came in here dead set on
the San Francisco cioppino.

01:19:48.037 --> 01:19:50.039
I'm very sorry, sir.
We will change your order right away.

01:19:50.081 --> 01:19:51.833
- And Guy will be your waiter.
- What?

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:54.502
Donnie, the table is Guy's now.

01:19:54.502 --> 01:19:56.712
No, no, no.
No, it was--

01:19:56.754 --> 01:19:59.590
- See? I can step up to the plate.
- Finally.

01:20:02.552 --> 01:20:05.555
Some pitchers of beer,
that bucket of jumbo shrimp,

01:20:05.596 --> 01:20:07.306
that spinach artichoke dip,

01:20:07.306 --> 01:20:09.809
and of course that 8-lb lobster
you were talking about.

01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:12.019
- Yes.
- And that should do it.

01:20:12.019 --> 01:20:14.021
Okay.

01:20:14.355 --> 01:20:16.023
Baby girl, what's wrong?

01:20:16.023 --> 01:20:18.776
It's just you guys are so nice.

01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:21.571
And this is my biggest check ever.

01:20:21.612 --> 01:20:24.365
I just really needed this.

01:20:24.407 --> 01:20:26.617
And you're the nicest waitress
we've ever had.

01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:30.079
You know, Mia,
I know you were pretty once.

01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:32.081
Thank you.

01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:44.719
That's disgusting.

01:20:46.804 --> 01:20:48.764
I'm gonna be sick.

01:20:57.117 --> 01:21:00.902
I just wanna win.

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:06.824
And, word to your mother.

01:21:06.824 --> 01:21:08.367
All right, girl.

01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:19.003
Nutella, I'm sorry.
This isn't the check that I gave you.

01:21:19.003 --> 01:21:21.964
Yeah it is.
Champ comped us.

01:21:22.006 --> 01:21:25.176
I throw a little knee right there.

01:21:25.176 --> 01:21:28.054
It bends him down.
Bam!

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.725
Well, were you dissatisfied
with the service?

01:21:32.767 --> 01:21:35.436
- You didn't leave a tip.
- Do the math.

01:21:35.478 --> 01:21:38.231
20% of nothing is nothing.

01:21:38.272 --> 01:21:40.650
Come on, y'all.
We outie.

01:21:50.868 --> 01:21:52.745
Shit.

01:22:22.567 --> 01:22:24.277
Here you go.
I didn't want to interrupt.

01:22:24.277 --> 01:22:25.611
Thank you.

01:22:25.611 --> 01:22:27.655
Have you read this?

01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:29.448
No. I can't say that I have.

01:22:29.448 --> 01:22:32.326
I did not know anything,

01:22:32.368 --> 01:22:34.579
anything at all till now.

01:22:37.707 --> 01:22:40.251
You remind me
of a young Andrew Bolkonski.

01:22:40.918 --> 01:22:42.962
Thank you.

01:22:43.004 --> 01:22:44.422
No, thank you.

01:22:44.422 --> 01:22:46.090
Thank you.

01:22:58.936 --> 01:23:00.855
I'm sorry, sir.
I think you made a mistake.

01:23:00.897 --> 01:23:02.815
I can't take that much money.

01:23:02.857 --> 01:23:05.818
I didn't make a mistake.
What's your name?

01:23:05.818 --> 01:23:08.070
Donald Kanogi.

01:23:08.112 --> 01:23:10.531
I'm dying, Donald Kanogi.

01:23:11.949 --> 01:23:15.203
My doctor told me
I have a month to live.

01:23:15.244 --> 01:23:18.998
Have you ever heard
of schistophosiasis?

01:23:18.998 --> 01:23:20.708
No, I haven't.

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.335
Well, I've got it.

01:23:22.376 --> 01:23:24.670
- I've got it hard.
- My God.

01:23:24.712 --> 01:23:27.924
All I wanted to do tonight
was to sit quietly,

01:23:27.965 --> 01:23:30.009
have a nice meal,

01:23:30.051 --> 01:23:32.512
read a little Russian
pre-existentialism.

01:23:33.212 --> 01:23:35.848
It was pretty crowded,
but unlike the other waiter,

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.851
you were content to let me
sit here nonetheless.

01:23:39.293 --> 01:23:41.345
And I thank you for that.

01:23:42.355 --> 01:23:44.190
But, sir...

01:23:44.432 --> 01:23:46.526
No, young man,

01:23:46.826 --> 01:23:48.820
you can't take it with you.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.531
Now if you'll excuse me,

01:23:51.572 --> 01:23:55.284
I've got a lot of living to do
before I die.

01:23:56.869 --> 01:23:58.412
Do svidaniya.

01:24:30.528 --> 01:24:31.997
That poor man.

01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:35.199
You know, it really puts things
into perspective.

01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:38.286
Fuck him and the horse
that rode over him.

01:24:38.327 --> 01:24:41.831
That's Guy.
Big heart, big hair.

01:24:41.873 --> 01:24:44.834
That's me. Throw big dick in there,
you got a box trifecta.

01:24:44.876 --> 01:24:47.879
You know what? It's way too late
for that kind of chatter.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.922
- Heyo, I've got the totals.
- All right.

01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:52.633
- Who wants to see some results?
- I do, I do.

01:24:52.675 --> 01:24:55.928
- Yeah.
- Gather round. This is pretty exciting.

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:58.681
- Gather around, everybody.
- All right.

01:24:58.723 --> 01:25:01.225
- I'm excited.
- Good.

01:25:01.225 --> 01:25:02.810
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

01:25:02.852 --> 01:25:05.646
Okay.
First, before I start, let me just say

01:25:05.688 --> 01:25:08.483
- I'm really proud of you guys.
- Thank you.

01:25:08.524 --> 01:25:10.693
Very proud.
I think you did a great job tonight.

01:25:10.735 --> 01:25:12.612
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:15.281
In 3rd place...

01:25:16.866 --> 01:25:19.285
- is the waiter...
- Jesus Christ.

01:25:19.285 --> 01:25:21.829
- who did a good job tonight...
- Say it, you big dog.

01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:25.666
- Come on.
- and his name is Nuts.

01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:29.170
- Hey, Nuts.
- In the pickle jar, all right.

01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:30.463
- Great.
- Okay.

01:25:30.505 --> 01:25:31.798
- Bring it.
- Here we go.

01:25:32.139 --> 01:25:35.009
In 2nd place,
and runner up,

01:25:35.851 --> 01:25:38.429
is...

01:25:38.429 --> 01:25:40.473
- Come on.
- Connor.

01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:41.974
What?
Who won?

01:25:42.016 --> 01:25:44.727
Drum roll, please.
Drum roll.

01:25:45.269 --> 01:25:47.063
Great, thank you.

01:25:47.104 --> 01:25:50.691
And the winner of the $10,000 prize

01:25:50.733 --> 01:25:52.860
and the big contest

01:25:53.202 --> 01:25:56.280
tonight is...

01:25:57.781 --> 01:25:58.825
Tara.

01:25:58.966 --> 01:26:01.494
- My God!
- Honk the goose.

01:26:01.536 --> 01:26:03.579
- What?
- My God, I won?

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:05.164
How is that even possible?

01:26:05.206 --> 01:26:09.168
Well, the guy who got hit by the horse
gave her a $1,000 tip.

01:26:09.168 --> 01:26:11.546
I had that table.
That's my table.

01:26:13.297 --> 01:26:14.799
Jesus, Donnie.

01:26:15.399 --> 01:26:17.552
You gave me a table,
I gave you a table.

01:26:17.593 --> 01:26:21.305
That is the most selfless thing
anyone has ever done for me.

01:26:21.305 --> 01:26:23.182
Well, when the Champ kills me,

01:26:23.224 --> 01:26:25.143
just see to it I get a decent burial.

01:26:25.143 --> 01:26:27.103
You're not gonna die.

01:26:27.103 --> 01:26:28.855
I'll give you mouth to mouth.

01:26:28.896 --> 01:26:32.108
Stick a sock in it before I puke.

01:26:33.401 --> 01:26:35.820
Richardo.
It's time.

01:26:36.362 --> 01:26:39.657
All right, if you guys will excuse me
for one second...

01:26:39.657 --> 01:26:40.992
All right, baby,

01:26:41.033 --> 01:26:43.870
what is the final take?

01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:46.998
Am I sitting in the lap
of luxury or what?

01:26:47.039 --> 01:26:49.333
Well, we made...

01:26:49.333 --> 01:26:52.086
$19,017.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.716
$19,017.

01:26:56.757 --> 01:26:58.134
Pretty good.

01:26:58.134 --> 01:27:00.970
But last time I checked,

01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:04.982
19 is lower than 20, right?

01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:08.519
That makes you a grand short,
short shorts.

01:27:10.813 --> 01:27:12.165
What's that?

01:27:12.607 --> 01:27:14.850
- The waiter's tips.
- Problem solved.

01:27:14.992 --> 01:27:17.528
I'll just take a grand out of that then.

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.322
No, no, no, hold on.

01:27:19.322 --> 01:27:21.532
Excuse me, Champ.
About the 10 grand.

01:27:21.574 --> 01:27:23.743
- Not now, Tara.
- The what?

01:27:23.784 --> 01:27:25.119
The $10,000.

01:27:25.328 --> 01:27:27.288
There is no $10,000.

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:29.999
That was all predicated
on an illusion.

01:27:29.999 --> 01:27:32.210
I don't understand.

01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:36.005
Okay, I'll break it down.
If I needed to make 20 tonight,

01:27:36.047 --> 01:27:39.717
why would I give away 10?
That makes no sense.

01:27:39.717 --> 01:27:41.136
Right, Rich?

01:27:42.377 --> 01:27:43.621
Right.

01:27:43.821 --> 01:27:45.097
Thank you.

01:27:45.739 --> 01:27:47.099
Adieu.

01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:54.535
Champ.

01:27:58.027 --> 01:28:00.238
This money belongs to the waiters.

01:28:00.238 --> 01:28:02.240
And you owe Tara $10,000.

01:28:03.741 --> 01:28:06.369
What the hell is wrong with you,
Richardo?

01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:09.296
You offered a prize
and now you owe her.

01:28:10.038 --> 01:28:11.833
You want to make something of it?

01:28:15.378 --> 01:28:17.296
Yeah, I do.

01:28:17.338 --> 01:28:20.299
Just do what you promised,
you motherfucker.

01:28:20.758 --> 01:28:22.635
What?

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.764
Well well well,

01:28:26.764 --> 01:28:29.142
looks like somebody's little acorns

01:28:29.142 --> 01:28:31.018
done grew into big nuts.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.437
You're finally acting like a man.

01:28:33.437 --> 01:28:35.648
But you're too little too late.

01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:37.942
I still got to pay
the Yakuza

01:28:37.942 --> 01:28:39.819
20,000 yen.

01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:42.530
Wait, yen or dollars?

01:28:42.572 --> 01:28:44.740
Same thing, stupid.

01:28:44.782 --> 01:28:47.076
Yen is Japanese for dollars.

01:28:49.203 --> 01:28:51.122
Actually, Champ, 20,000 yen

01:28:51.122 --> 01:28:54.625
is about 170 American dollars.

01:28:54.667 --> 01:28:57.587
Ah-so.

01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:02.008
In circumspeculation
that makes sense.

01:29:02.008 --> 01:29:04.760
When I was in the Orient
I used to wonder to myself

01:29:04.802 --> 01:29:07.138
why is everything so small

01:29:07.138 --> 01:29:10.349
yet so expensive?

01:29:10.391 --> 01:29:12.268
Good work, Dr. Doolittle.

01:29:13.269 --> 01:29:15.521
170 for me.

01:29:15.563 --> 01:29:17.356
10 grand for you.

01:29:19.275 --> 01:29:21.360
What do you think I should
do with the rest of it?

01:29:21.402 --> 01:29:23.112
I think you should
give it to the waiters.

01:29:23.154 --> 01:29:26.199
- I think they earned it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.869
I was wrong to think they
could be replaced by robots.

01:29:30.803 --> 01:29:32.205
Nice one, Rich.

01:29:32.546 --> 01:29:34.582
Feed, my pretties, feed.

01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:39.045
My God!

01:29:47.178 --> 01:29:48.805
Money money money!

01:29:49.447 --> 01:29:50.723
God.

01:29:51.866 --> 01:29:53.267
Rich.

01:29:53.309 --> 01:29:56.145
- That was legendary.
- Thank you.

01:30:02.527 --> 01:30:06.197
Well, I guess I should thank you
properly for what you did.

01:30:11.202 --> 01:30:12.954
That's so nice.

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:21.587
Subtitles: Arigon

01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:45.111
Just--

01:30:45.111 --> 01:30:46.362
Okay.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.950
Okay okay,
what the fuck, Donnie?

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:52.577
You see that, Donnie?

01:30:52.577 --> 01:30:54.829
That's how you kiss a girl,
you fucking fruit cake.

01:30:56.247 --> 01:30:58.124
I hate you.

01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:02.253
God.

01:31:02.295 --> 01:31:04.297
It tastes like tartar sauce.

01:31:04.338 --> 01:31:06.340
Wait wait wait wait.
Hold on.

01:31:06.382 --> 01:31:08.634
I almost forgot.

01:31:08.676 --> 01:31:12.221
I still got to kick the shit
out of the low man.

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:14.891
Is he fucking serious?

01:31:14.932 --> 01:31:16.225
God.

01:31:19.604 --> 01:31:22.190
<i>Why are you hitting yourself?</i>

01:31:22.315 --> 01:31:24.400
<i>Why are you hitting yourself?</i>

01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:27.570
Why are you hitting yourself?
Have you gone crazy?

01:31:27.612 --> 01:31:29.071
Are you crazy, man?

01:31:29.113 --> 01:31:30.907
All right, come on.
Let's get this over with.

01:31:30.948 --> 01:31:32.992
I've got to get home and watch
"Dancing with the Stars."

01:31:33.034 --> 01:31:34.702
Nick Lachey is doing the jitterbug.

01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:35.995
He's good.
Have you ever seen him?

01:31:36.037 --> 01:31:37.663
- No, no.
- You've got your guards up.

01:31:37.905 --> 01:31:39.499
- You want to fight?
- You're just kidding, right, Champ?

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.793
Don't be so scared.
You should learn to control your fears.

01:31:42.793 --> 01:31:44.921
Take me for instance.
I'm afraid of the dark.

01:31:44.921 --> 01:31:47.173
But you'd never know it
'cause I have mental discipline.

01:31:47.215 --> 01:31:49.801
You know what I'm saying?
I don't even use a nightlight no more.

01:31:49.842 --> 01:31:52.553
- Okay, okay.
- What's up?

01:31:52.595 --> 01:31:54.305
What? What's up?
What's up?

01:31:54.305 --> 01:31:58.392
<i>* It's the cry of the cougar,
the fist to the face</i>

01:31:58.434 --> 01:32:02.647
<i>* No pride or glory for the loser</i>

01:32:02.647 --> 01:32:06.275
<i>* There's blood and broken teeth
all over the place</i>

01:32:06.275 --> 01:32:08.236
<i>* And the last thing you'll hear</i>

01:32:08.277 --> 01:32:12.240
<i>* Is the cry of the cougar</i>

01:32:14.826 --> 01:32:16.744
<i>* Lock your doors</i>

01:32:16.786 --> 01:32:19.539
<i>* Get off the streets,
I'm on the prowl</i>

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.500
<i>* I'm telling you
I'm on the hunt now</i>

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.669
<i>* Don't try to stop me</i>

01:32:24.710 --> 01:32:29.340
<i>* I smell raw meat and I ain't had
shit to eat for 6 days</i>

01:32:30.758 --> 01:32:34.095
<i>* Who wants a piece?
Who wants a shot?</i>

01:32:34.137 --> 01:32:38.808
<i>* Who wants a long and brutal
bloody painful smackdown?</i>

01:32:38.808 --> 01:32:42.186
<i>* You in the glasses,
I'm talking to you</i>

01:32:42.186 --> 01:32:45.565
<i>* How'd you like
my foot up your ass?</i>

01:32:47.984 --> 01:32:49.861
<i>* It's the cry of the cougar</i>

01:32:49.902 --> 01:32:51.696
<i>* The fist to the face</i>

01:32:51.737 --> 01:32:56.367
<i>* I'm gonna shoot you
with my Luger</i>

01:32:56.409 --> 01:32:59.704
<i>* There's blood and broken teeth
all over the place</i>

01:32:59.745 --> 01:33:01.664
<i>* And the last thing you'll hear</i>

01:33:01.664 --> 01:33:05.585
<i>* Is the cry of the cougar</i>

01:33:12.592 --> 01:33:14.510
<i>* I've got the speed</i>

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:16.387
<i>* I've got the book</i>

01:33:16.387 --> 01:33:18.389
<i>* I'm lean and mean
and swift and tough</i>

01:33:18.389 --> 01:33:20.433
<i>* And big and fast, yeah</i>

01:33:20.475 --> 01:33:22.393
<i>* It's like if a ninja man</i>

01:33:22.393 --> 01:33:23.936
<i>* Had sex with the Hulk</i>

01:33:23.978 --> 01:33:27.565
<i>* And gave birth to some kind
of crazy ninja Hulk</i>

01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:29.859
<i>* It's the cry of the cougar</i>

01:33:29.859 --> 01:33:32.153
<i>* The fist to the face</i>

01:33:32.195 --> 01:33:36.365
<i>* I'll slash you up
like Freddy Krueger</i>

01:33:36.365 --> 01:33:39.911
<i>* There's blood and broken teeth
all over the place</i>

01:33:39.952 --> 01:33:43.247
<i>* When your mom finds your body
she'll cry</i>

01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:46.584
<i>* The cry of the cougar</i>

01:33:49.003 --> 01:33:52.757
<i>* Cry, cougar, cry.</i>

01:33:54.008 --> 01:33:55.676
What's up, noodle dicks?

01:33:55.718 --> 01:33:57.178
That to-do-you--

01:33:59.597 --> 01:34:01.682
Hey, noodle dicks.

01:34:01.724 --> 01:34:04.310
God damn it.
Come on.

01:34:04.644 --> 01:34:06.521
What's up, noodle dicks?

01:34:06.562 --> 01:34:09.941
That table over there just ordered
2 rounds of premium tequila.

01:34:09.941 --> 01:34:12.068
Now you guys--
now you guys--

01:34:12.068 --> 01:34:14.070
Shit!

01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:16.322
I missed each and every one of you.

01:34:21.452 --> 01:34:24.664
I don't like that shit.
I don't like the dark.

01:34:24.705 --> 01:34:27.208
Y'all didn't fucking see "Green Mile"?

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:29.001
I am afraid of the dark.

01:34:29.043 --> 01:34:31.462
- That's fucked up.
- Cut.

01:34:33.381 --> 01:34:35.383
My God, that's crazy.

01:34:35.424 --> 01:34:37.301
And I'm Barack Obama.

01:34:37.301 --> 01:34:38.928
And I'm Osama bin Laden.

01:34:39.137 --> 01:34:40.555
And I'm Obama bin Laden.

01:34:40.596 --> 01:34:41.973
And I'm Shaquille O'Neal.

01:34:42.014 --> 01:34:45.268
And I'm Gloria Estefan
from the Miami Sound Machine.

01:34:50.106 --> 01:34:51.983
I can do it.
I can do it.

01:34:59.615 --> 01:35:02.034
- Can you do a faster one, please?
- Okay.

01:35:06.622 --> 01:35:08.624
Cut.

01:35:17.175 --> 01:35:19.218
Good, let's go from the top again.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.762
Is it gross?
All right, cut.

01:35:21.804 --> 01:35:23.264
Cut cut cut.

01:35:23.306 --> 01:35:24.932
It wasn't gross.
I just thought I'd put it back.

01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:31.939
Well, you know what they say:

01:35:31.981 --> 01:35:34.025
All the good ones are either gay or crazy.

01:35:34.066 --> 01:35:35.818
Or fat. Or gassy.

01:35:35.818 --> 01:35:37.987
Or Dutch. Or uncircumcised.

01:35:39.113 --> 01:35:41.115
What does that mean?

01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:42.909
Cut!

01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:45.620
And she throws an elbow
across like this.

01:35:45.703 --> 01:35:47.955
So I want to grab her--
I started to do like that.

01:35:47.997 --> 01:35:49.957
Body shot, body shot,
body shot, body shot.

01:35:49.999 --> 01:35:51.375
We were in the clinch like this

01:35:51.375 --> 01:35:53.377
and I started to go,
"Bitch, what the fuck are you doing?"

01:35:53.377 --> 01:35:55.254
So I'm like...
and I'm trying to hit him.

01:35:55.254 --> 01:35:57.298
And we cover up like this
and I'm moving around.

01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.883
I'm like, "This dude is--"

01:35:58.925 --> 01:36:00.301
no, don't turn your back.
Stay right here.

01:36:00.343 --> 01:36:02.845
Last week on "Heroes."

01:36:02.887 --> 01:36:05.598
Yeah, cut.
Yes. Very good.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.952
'Cause I'm bored.

01:36:26.244 --> 01:36:28.579
Cut. Cut.

01:36:35.711 --> 01:36:38.965
<i>* Ay, mamacita</i>

01:36:38.965 --> 01:36:41.300
<i>* Go on and do your thing, yeah</i>

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.219
<i>* Go on and do your thing, girl</i>

01:36:43.261 --> 01:36:45.972
<i>* Ay, mamacita</i>

<i>* Go on and do your thing, girl</i>

01:37:59.712 --> 01:38:02.006
<i>* Ay, mamacita</i>

01:38:02.048 --> 01:38:04.300
<i>* Go on and do your thing, yeah</i>

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.260
<i>* Oh, yeah</i>

01:38:06.302 --> 01:38:08.471
<i>* Ay, mamacita.</i>
