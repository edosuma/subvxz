MR. O'TOOLE,
I'M MYSTIFIED.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.828
I'M ABSOLUTELY MYSTIFIED.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.786

RIGHT OFF IN MY HANDS.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.968
YOU HERE AGAIN?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.804
DIDN'T MY OLD MAN SAY

09:24.898 --> 09:26.514
HE WAS GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE NOSE

09:26.608 --> 09:28.394
IF YOU CAME AROUND HERE
BOTHERING US AGAIN?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.317
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.985
IT'S THE WRONG NUMBER.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.771
I WAS HEADED
ACROSS THE STREET.

09:37.243 --> 09:42.329
NOVV THAT'S NOT THE BEST OF
ALL POSSIBLE MANNERS, IS IT?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.577

I REALLY DON'T...

10:07.690 --> 10:09.101

10:09.192 --> 10:10.523
WHAT ON EARTH IS
HAPPENING TO ME?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.477
TAXI, TAXI, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.275
OH, BELIEVE ME!

10:19.369 --> 10:22.703
THIS IS AS MUCH A MYSTERY
TO ME AS IT IS TO YOU.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.456

10:57.532 --> 11:00.240

11:00.326 --> 11:02.408
I'M CERTAINLY
NOT A MASHER.

11:02.453 --> 11:06.321

ANSWERING A QUESTION?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.578

11:08.668 --> 11:12.286
WELL, WHAT I MEAN
IS LOOKING AT ME

11:12.380 --> 11:15.668

CURSORY FIRST SURVEIL,

11:15.758 --> 11:18.921

IN ANY VVAY?

11:18.970 --> 11:21.678
NOT AT ALL.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.426
NOT UNLESS YOU PLAN TO
USE THAT IN THE PARK.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.099
OH, THAT.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.011
DO YOU KNOW THAT UP
UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO

11:29.105 --> 11:30.846
I SOLD THOSE?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.352
OR I WENT THROUGH
THE MOTIONS.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.151
I VVAS A VERY BAD SALESMAN.
MISERABLE.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.693
YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK

11:37.780 --> 11:40.863
I ONLY MADE 89 CENTS
IN COMMISSIONS.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.362
THAT WAS FOR
AN ATTACHMENT.

11:43.453 --> 11:47.117
IT'S THE
UPHOLSTERY NOZZLE.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.539
AND I SOLD IT
TO A DRUNK

11:49.626 --> 11:52.789
VVHO THOUGHT IT VVAS A
DIVINING ROD FOR ALCOHOL.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.167
OH, I FULLY EXPECT
TO BE FIRED

11:56.257 --> 11:58.715
BUT THAT IS THE LEAST
OF MY TROUBLE.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.465
WOULD YOU
BE INTERESTED

12:02.513 --> 12:05.050

12:56.609 --> 12:57.940
GET ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.563
