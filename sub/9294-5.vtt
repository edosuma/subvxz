00:11.300 --> 00:13.000
Previously on 24

00:14.000 --> 00:15.800
This is counel Eka Dubako

00:17.000 --> 00:19.200
We have the CIP device

00:19.500 --> 00:20.700
We demand

00:21.100 --> 00:24.500
the complete withdrawl of the U.S. Naval Strike Force

00:24.600 --> 00:26.200
by this time tomorrow.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.000
You are recalling 
the invasion force.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.100
Well, that determination
has yet to be made.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.299
I implore you,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.500
do not abandon my country.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.000
It's Samantha Roth.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.700
<i>She says</i>
 <i>she has new information</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:39.900
<i>regarding my son's death.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:42.900
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.600
He uncovered
other blind accounts,

00:44.700 --> 00:46.400
accounts that were traced
to a senior member

00:46.500 --> 00:48.100
of your wife's
administration.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.700
It's all here.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.800
Account numbers,
trading records,

00:51.900 --> 00:53.100
everything that he knew.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.200
Bauer must have worked out
this escape

00:55.300 --> 00:56.500
with Almeida's people.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.400
That son of a bitch played me.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.400
Had me believing
the Bureau was compromised--

00:59.500 --> 01:00.800
someone on the inside
working against us.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.600
I realize now
it was him all along.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.099
MOSS:
 <i>He played us both.</i>

01:05.200 --> 01:06.400
I'm going to make
this right, Larry.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.000
Whatever it takes,
I will find Bauer and Almeida.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.500
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner.
Tell me what you know.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.300
I'm not going to tell u
a damn thing.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.500
(groans)
Where is Almeida?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.100
Tanner says Almeida's crew
has a plan to abduct

01:17.200 --> 01:19.100
former Prime Minister
of Sangala.

01:19.200 --> 01:19.700
Matobo?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.100
When?
Pretty much now.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.700
Why didn't you call
the authorities?

01:22.800 --> 01:24.600
BUCHANAN:
He couldn't, Jack.
Why not?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.100
He found out Emerson's client
was Dubaku.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.100
That's who you believe has
agents inside the government.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.100
Dubaku is the key
to this thing, Jack.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.100
If we're going to
uncover the conspiracy,

01:34.200 --> 01:36.300
we have to get to him
before he leaves the U.S.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.500
ALMEIDA:
I got away from the FBI.
Yeah, I heard.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.600
I also heard it was Jack Bauer
who broke you out.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.600
He's on board now.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.400
The package is a person.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.000
EMERSON:
Former Prime Minister Matobo
of Sangala.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.200
The assignment is to grab him,
deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.

01:51.300 --> 01:51.800
(explosion)

01:53.500 --> 01:55.400
Where's Matobo?!
Where is he?!

02:01.300 --> 02:03.300
It's a safe room;
reinforced concrete.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.900
Jack, we leave here
without Matobo,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.900
we lose our only chance
of getting at Dubaku.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.700
???

02:15.300 --> 02:16.200
Matobo's security chief

02:16.300 --> 02:17.900
said there's a safe room
at his residence.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.300
They should have him
and his wife locked down by now.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.100
They'll be safe
till your team gets there.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.200
Your priority is to grab Almeida
and bring him back here.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.400
We'll make every effort
to use nonlethal force,

02:27.500 --> 02:29.900
but Almeida's crew
is ex-military.

02:30.100 --> 02:30.800
They're going to be hard
to subdue

02:30.900 --> 02:32.200
unless my men can return fire.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.600
I understand you'll be
exposing your men,

02:33.700 --> 02:35.500
but it's a risk
you need to take.
Sir...

02:35.600 --> 02:38.000
Almeida is the only
viable lead we've got

02:38.100 --> 02:39.900
to retrieve
the CIP device.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.300
You need to bring him in alive,
is that understood?

02:43.300 --> 02:44.000
Understood.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.200
Let's move out.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.900
We'll get our
updates in the van.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.300
(pained grunting)

02:51.300 --> 02:52.300
Open the safe room.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.100
(grunts)

02:58.400 --> 03:01.500
I will keep going until
you open the door.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.200
(panting):
I've already told you.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.200
Once it's closed, you can only
open it from the inside.

03:07.700 --> 03:08.800
Do whatever
you want to me,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.100
but you will never
get into that room.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.500
(blows landing, Eto'o grunts)

03:16.300 --> 03:17.600
We've got to get Matobo.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.300
Without him, we've got nothing.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.300
I know.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.600
Find a way in yet?
No.

03:30.200 --> 03:30.800
Litvak, any luck

03:30.900 --> 03:32.200
reconnecting the intercom?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.000
Not yet.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.000
I'm working on it.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.700
(phone ringing)
Sir, this just came in...

03:44.800 --> 03:46.100
I'm in the middle
of a field op, Erika.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.100
I don't really have
a lot of time right now.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.300
It's from the
attorney general.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.600
I think you should
make time for this.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.900
What is it?
Tanner's lawyers are
filing a complaint

03:52.000 --> 03:53.100
against the Bureau.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.700 --> 04:04.600
(speed dialing)

04:10.200 --> 04:11.000
(phone rings)

04:12.600 --> 04:12.900
Walker.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.800
MOSS:
Renee, it's me.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.700
I'm less than 15 minutes away
from Matobo's house.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.200
When I get there,
I'll recon for the Tac Team.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.300
Stop a second.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.000
What?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.600
This information about Matobo
being abducted...

04:23.900 --> 04:24.900
tell me how you got it.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.800
You know how I got it--
I questioned Tanner.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.000
You questioned him?

04:28.600 --> 04:29.100
Yeah.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.600
Tanner's lawyers
are saying

04:31.700 --> 04:33.900
you locked them
out of his hospital room,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.500
then cut off
his ventilator.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
They said you
applied pressure

04:37.700 --> 04:38.600
to his gunshot wound.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.900
We needed Almeida's location.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.600
Tanner was not about
to cooperate.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.500
So you tortured him.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.600
What the hell were you thinking?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.400
I got the information we needed.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.700
Information that
may not even be valid.

04:55.100 --> 04:55.900
You know as well as I do,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.800
coercive interrogation
is unreliable.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.500
No, Tanner was not lying.

05:59.800 --> 05:00.600
You know that?
How do you know

05:00.600 --> 05:02.400
he wasn't just telling you
what you wanted to hear?

05:02.500 --> 05:04.200
I'll find out when I
get to Matobo's house.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.300
No, you're not
going to Matobo's.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.900
You're coming back
here to the office.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.000
The attorney general
is sending somebody here,

05:09.100 --> 05:10.400
and you're going to tell him
everything that happened.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.200
Larry...

05:11.600 --> 05:13.500
it's my fault that Bauer 
and Almeida are still at large.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.100
Please, let me play this out.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.200
I will deal
with the consequences

05:16.300 --> 05:18.000
after we find the CIP device.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.000
No, the field team is on the
way, they can handle this.

05:21.400 --> 05:21.900
Renee,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.800
get back here now.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.000
I'm sorry, Larry,

05:27.400 --> 05:28.500
but I need to make this right.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.300
Renee?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.700
(turns off phone)

05:35.900 --> 05:36.600
Damn it.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.100
I'm glad you're all right, babe.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.000
The flight attendant said
something about us getting

05:48.100 --> 05:49.700
a priority clearance to land.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.100
Uh, you got lucky.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.600
Did I?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.100
I mean, it happened
just after we spoke,

05:55.200 --> 05:57.800
so I thought maybe you had
something to do with it.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.600
Me? How could I
have done anything?

06:00.100 --> 06:02.100
Listen, I might
be late tonight.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
There's a lot
going on at work.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.500
I haven't seen you in a week.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.800
I thought we could spend
some time together.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.300
Dinner, and maybe...

06:11.600 --> 06:12.100
...you know.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.400
Sorry, I have to go.
I have to get back to work.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.500
Call me later.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.600
Okay.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.800
Did you deploy the field teams?

06:20.900 --> 06:21.800
Yeah, they just left.

06:22.200 --> 06:22.800
We need to coordinate

06:22.900 --> 06:24.900
with Matobo's security chief--
get him back on the line.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.700
(keypad beeping)

06:31.800 --> 06:32.400
(dial tone drones)

06:33.500 --> 06:35.100
(hangs up phone)

06:38.000 --> 06:40.900
These people, they work
for Dubaku, don't they?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.000
Possibly.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.100
Yes, probably.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.300
But if they wanted me dead,
I would be dead.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.500
Then what do they want?

06:47.900 --> 06:48.800
Names.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.100
Names?

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
Of my allies inside Sangala.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.900
You would die before you exposed
them, they know that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.300
Yes, they do, but..

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Then it's me.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.400
It's me.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.100
They want to use me
to get you to ta?

07:15.700 --> 07:16.500
Don't worry.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.800
We'll be safe in here
until they leave.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
Ule, I'm scared.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.600
Alama, listen to me.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.100
We need to stay calm.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.000
We'll be fine.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.500
The FBI knows we are here.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.800
They'll come for us soon.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.500
Okay?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.500
EMERSON (over intercom):
Mr. Matobo?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.300
I know you can see and hear me.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.900
Come out now
and nobody has to get hurt.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.300
You are wasting your time.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.400
(cocks gun)

07:48.900 --> 07:50.900
Come out now or
I will kill your man.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.900
You have one minute.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.600
Fifty...

08:06.900 --> 08:08.500
I am prepared to die, sir.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.100
For you and for Sangala.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.200
Eto'o is right.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.200
Without you,
Sangala has no leader.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.300
The people need <i>you.</i>

08:29.500 --> 08:30.900
30 seconds.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.299
Eto'o's courage is stronger
than your threats.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.100
He is willing to die.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.000
And for that sacrifice
he has my eternal gratitude,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.600
and the gratitude
of the people of Sangala.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.200
Ten seconds.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.400
Time's up.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.900
(phone ringing)

09:02.700 --> 09:04.100
(phone line ringing)

09:15.100 --> 09:17.000
I just got through to him
15 minutes ago.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.000
Well, he's not answering now.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.600
Then get me someone
else at the residence.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.000
It's the FBI.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.100
Does the FBI know we're here?

09:34.200 --> 09:34.700
Tanner.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.300
He's the only one who knew
we were grabbing Matobo.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.000
He must have talked.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.700
Sir, we need to go
before they get here.

09:39.900 --> 09:40.900
Not without Matobo.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.500
Those walls are
two feet thick.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.900
Even if we blow a hole
with a shaped charge,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.400
they'll kill everyone inside.

09:46.100 --> 09:46.700
I think I found a way.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.000
Yeah? Like what?

09:49.100 --> 09:49.100
We can gas them out.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.000
We don't have anything!
We'll find something!

09:51.600 --> 09:52.400
There's a ventilation system

09:52.500 --> 09:53.700
running straight
into the safe room.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.400
If I can feed the gas through
that, it'll flush 'em out.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.900
LITVAK:
The FBI is coming!

09:57.000 --> 09:58.800
They won't be here
for at least 15 minutes.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.000
What are you talking about?
How do you know?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.700
If they knew anything
before we got here,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.300
they'd have evacuated Matobo.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.300
That's just guesswork.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.000
The tac teams are staged
out of the DC branch office,

10:07.100 --> 10:08.900
That's 21 miles from here, 
with traffic.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.600
That gives us at
least 15 minutes.

10:10.700 --> 10:11.700
We're not leaving
without Matobo.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.200
That's what Dubaku
is paying us for.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.200
You're not seriously
considering...
Shut up!

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
What kind of gas are
you talking about?

10:17.700 --> 10:18.400
Ammonium dysterate.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.400
We can make it from basic
household products.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Do it.
Tony, give me a hand.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.400
Jack, you do know ammonium
dysterate could kill them

10:33.500 --> 10:34.800
as easily as flush them out.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.400
That's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.900
Delivering Matobo
is our only chance

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
to get to Dubaku
and the CIP device.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.400
I got it. Grab those bowls.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Gotten into the vent yet?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.800
Yeah! The fbi will
be here any minute.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
Mr. Matobo...

12:13.300 --> 12:15.900
We've accessed the air
intake to your safe room.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.000
We are now feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.500
If you do not open
the door you will die.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.500
I believe that you are
willing to sacrifice your life.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.000
But are you also willing To
sentence your wife to death?

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
Ule...

12:39.800 --> 12:42.000
You know what they will do
if we open the door.

12:45.700 --> 12:46.700
I know.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.600
I can't let them
force me to name names.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.500
Our cause is more
important than we are.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.300
Take my hand.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.600
- Janis gold?
- Yes?

13:15.700 --> 13:17.600
I'm raymond howell From
the attorney general's office,

13:17.600 --> 13:18.800
Is there some place
we can talk?

13:19.100 --> 13:20.000
About?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.600
What happened At
the hospital, ms. Gold.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.800
Agent walker's being accused
Of torturing your suspect.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.800
He's not my suspect,

13:25.800 --> 13:28.900
i have no idea what happened After
i left that room, i am not involved.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.800
The suspect's attorneys claim that
you sent them To the wrong hospital room,

13:32.800 --> 13:34.200
To buy agent walker
more time.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.500
So it sounds to me like
you were involved.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.900
This is going to have to wait.
Janis, i need you on comm, now.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.800
Agent moss, The a.G. Personally
initiated this investigation.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.700
Howell, Open your eyes,
we have a situation.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.400
She cannot deal with
this right now.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.500
Please, Have a seat. Come here.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.600
What's going on?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.200
We think almeida and his crew
may already at matobo's.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.600
And we can't reach
renee to warn her.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.900
Why can't you reach her?

13:53.900 --> 13:55.400
When i heard
what she did To tanner,

13:55.400 --> 13:57.800
i ordered her back to headquarters
To talk to the a.G's office,

13:57.800 --> 14:00.100
And she, uh, refused,
turned off her cell.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.500
Oh.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.000
- I need yourunning point On swat.
- Okay, thanks.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.600
Hillinger, keep trying
to reach renee.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.600
We're running out of time.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.100
Put more gas in!

14:42.100 --> 14:43.700
If we do, it'll kill
them instantly.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.800
How much time is it
going to take, jack?

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
It's up to them.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.000
I can't breathe.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.800
Just close your eyes,
let it happen.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.200
I know if we open that
door, it will be worse.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.900
I love you.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.300
Alama, no!

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
Get him out of there!

15:39.100 --> 15:40.100
Get the woman, too.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.000
Just breathe, you'll
be all right.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.600
- Just breathe.
- Okay, let's go!

15:54.400 --> 15:55.900
I'm so sorry.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
Let's go.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.300
- It's moss.
- Larry, it's renee.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.200
Renee, listen.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.000
Bauer and almeida may
already be at matobo's.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.300
Yeah, They are, i've got a visual on them
Loading matobo and his wife into a truck.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.600
Where the hell is swat?

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
How long for swat?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.900
They're still about five minutes
out. Renee, listen to me,

16:40.900 --> 16:43.500
i want you To stand down and
fallback until they get there.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.500
Do you hear me?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.900
Let me just get a plate
on the vehicle.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Drop the gun.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
Renee?

16:53.900 --> 16:54.900
Renee?

16:56.300 --> 16:57.300
Damn it!

16:58.800 --> 17:00.000
Janis, try getting her back.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.800
- Whose swat team will be first on scene?
- Remick's.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Get him for me, now.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.099
Move!

17:11.599 --> 17:12.599
Mr. Emerson!

17:14.700 --> 17:16.099
Far as i can tell,
she's alone.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.599
Damn you, bauer,
you son of a bitch.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.400
She's fbi.
Her name is walker.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.100
She's the one that pulled me Out of
the senate hearing to help me find tony.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.600
Don't be stupid.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.000
What are you talking about?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.800
How much does tanner know
About your operation?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.200
Enough to cause problems.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
We need to find out from
her what he Told the fbi--

17:37.700 --> 17:39.000
Till then We do nothing.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
He's right, david.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.100
We need to be sure nothing
else has been compromised.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Get her in the cage.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Don't you touch me.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.700
Get your hands
off of me!

17:51.700 --> 17:54.300
Shut up or i will
Shut you up.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.300
She's clean.
let's go!

18:32.600 --> 18:33.800
- Do you have matobo?
- Yeah.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.700
And the wife,
but we ran Into a complication.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.200
A complication?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.900
Fbi knew about the operation.
Which means tanner talked.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.000
- I don't like this.
- No, neither do i.

18:43.900 --> 18:46.700
We got one of their agents
With us, her name's walker.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.200
I need you to check With
your source at the bureau,

18:49.200 --> 18:50.800
Find out how much she knows.

18:50.900 --> 18:51.700
All right.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.100
If your source doesn't
come up all right. With anything,

18:53.100 --> 18:54.900
we'll interrogate her
when we get there.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.000
Can't believe i trusted you.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.700
You lying son of a bitch.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.000
This is important, man.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.900
To him and me.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.900
Thanks, appreciate it.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.400
- Any luck?
- Yes, sir.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.700
I'm sorry it took so long,

19:37.700 --> 19:40.300
but I tracked down a friend who
does crypto for the private sector--

19:40.400 --> 19:42.800
he says he should be able to
crack the files on the thumb-drive.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.000
Provided the, uh, encryption
isn't military grade or better.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.800
I doubt Roger would have had
access to anything like that.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.400
He also said you'd have a lot easier job
if you just went to the NSA.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.300
Not until we know how badly my wife's
administration's been compromised.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.500
My friend said he'd meet us
at his apartment in 20 minutes.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.100
Do you trust him?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.800
Yes.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.000
Samantha says the documents
will prove my son was murdered.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.600
I'll make sure he understands
this can't go anywhere.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
Thank you, Brian.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.500
You don't know what
it's been like.

20:17.700 --> 20:22.100
All this time, knowing in my bones
Roger didn't commit suicide,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.900
and having people
just tolerate me,

20:25.100 --> 20:28.200
tell me it was
my grief talking.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
I'm going to find the people
who did this to my son, Brian.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.300
And I am going
to make them pay.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.400
Sir, if I ma..

20:38.500 --> 20:39.600
What is it?

20:39.800 --> 20:43.400
Shouldn't you at least tell
the President what you're doing?

20:45.300 --> 20:48.600
I can't take this
to my wife...

20:48.900 --> 20:51.300
until I can prove it.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.400
You wanted to see me?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.500
One thing I've learned:

21:01.600 --> 21:04.500
presidents don't
make new friends.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.500
That's why they lean
on their old ones.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.500
I'll need your
support, Ethan.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.500
I'm going to authorize the military
operation in Sangala as planned.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.700
Madame President...

21:19.700 --> 21:22.300
You don't need to list
the consequences, Ethan.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.600
Any action I take in West Africa

21:24.600 --> 21:27.400
will likely result
in a terrorist attack here,

21:27.500 --> 21:32.700
but if I take no action, an entire neration
of Sangalans will be wiped out.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.800
Your critics will point out <i>you took
an oath to protect the people of this country.</i>

21:36.900 --> 21:41.900
And the way to do that is not
give in to blackmail and threats.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.200
Ethan...

21:45.300 --> 21:48.400
taking a stand
against the genocide in Sangala

21:48.500 --> 21:53.000
has reestablished our leadership and our
moral authority in the eyes of the world.

21:53.200 --> 21:57.100
I cannot and
I will not back down.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.000
- Yes?
- Madame President,

22:00.100 --> 22:02.900
Secretary of State Stevens
is here to see you. It's urgent.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.700
Send him in.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.400
What is it, Joe?

22:07.600 --> 22:11.700
The FBI just reported that Prime Minister Matobo
and his wife were abducted from their residence.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.000
What?!

22:13.100 --> 22:14.600
Abducted by whom?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.100
His bodyguards identified Jack Bauer and
Tony Almeida as two of the men involved,

22:18.200 --> 22:21.800
which means Dubaku has
the CIP device and Matobo.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.500
Where is the FBI on finding him?
Do they have any active leads?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.900
Not yet, Madame President. They're just
beginning the search operation.

22:29.100 --> 22:33.500
I think we need to talk about how
Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.500
Matobo is the only man
with enough popular support

22:36.600 --> 22:39.400
and strength to lead Sangala
after an invasion.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.200
Without him, the country would collapse
in complete bloodshed and chaos.

22:43.300 --> 22:46.500
Which means the best course of action
may be to meet Dubaku's demand 

22:46.600 --> 22:48.800
and withdraw our forces.

22:49.300 --> 22:53.300
The best course of action is to find
Matobo and the people who took him.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.900
And make sure the FBI brings
in every relevant agency.

23:00.100 --> 23:02.100
Yes, ma'am.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.100
So... 

23:04.200 --> 23:07.600
where do we stand with your decision
to go through with the invasion?

23:09.000 --> 23:12.300
We still have 30 minutes
before Dubaku's deadline.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.300
I want Matobo found by then.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.500
I just sent you new
search coordinates.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.300
Upload a grid to the ground teams, please.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.800
I already did  they're
adjusting their perimeter now.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.900
All right, thanks.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.200
- Listen, Erika.
- What?

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.800
You're worried about
your wife on a plane. It's cool.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.800
She's on the ground now.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.100
Her plane landed; she got lucky.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.400
That's great news.
I'm glad she's okay.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.100
Hey, Sean.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.600
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.900
Yeah, me, too.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.100
Excuse me.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.600
Sean, I need you to babysit
the downloads on my computer.

23:52.700 --> 23:56.200
They're coming in from the forensics
team at Matobo's residence.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.300
Now, please.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.300
Okay, sure.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.800
Excuse me. Remick's team just finished a
sweep of the Matobo residence.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.300
He's on line two
if you want to talk to him.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.300
Janis, wait.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.600
Did you findenee?

24:17.700 --> 24:22.300
No, sir, but one of Matobo's bodyguards
saw her being taken by Bauer and Almeida.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.100
Then she's alive.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.000
She's with the Matobos.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.700
We'll run a trace
on her cell.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.100
Can't do that, sir.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.200
We recovered Agent Walker's
phone and weapon on-site.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.200
Forensics is still
sweeping the scene.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.300
All right, I want to be the first to know
if they find something.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
Yes, sir.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.800
All right, um...

24:44.800 --> 24:47.400
get Renee's picture and
description out to all agencies.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.500
Put me in the queue for
a real-time update from Homeland.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.400
Okay.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.400
Janis.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.300
I want everybody in this office 

24:56.400 --> 24:59.500
to make finding her their top priority.
Is that understood?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.200
It is.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
Are you going to be okay?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.100
What are you talking about?

25:11.200 --> 25:13.500
Just get to work.

25:34.700 --> 25:38.000
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you, sir.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.700
You have nothing
to apologize for.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.400
How much are they
paying you, Jack?

25:50.500 --> 25:54.600
I hope it's enough to live with yourself when
they kill innocent Americans with the CIP device.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.200
Shut up.

25:57.100 --> 26:00.300
How many people will die
because of what you're doing?

26:01.900 --> 26:03.500
- Emerson.
- You were right.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.700
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.100
How much did Tanner spill?

26:07.300 --> 26:10.500
Other than the details
of Matobo's abduction, nothing.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.300
- You're sure?
- Positive.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.800
Walker is extraneous.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.900
Kill her before you get here.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.000
Okay, we'll be with you soon.

26:18.100 --> 26:18.900
Be quick about it.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.300
Dubaku's anxious to get his
hands on the prime minister.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.800
Nichols checked with
his source at the Bureau.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.000
Walker doesn't know anything
that can compromise the operation.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.200
You trust Nichols' source?

26:31.300 --> 26:32.600
Nichols does.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.500
That's good enough for me.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.400
Litvak, change of plan.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.400
- Take a right on Morrison Avenue.
- got it

26:40.200 --> 26:41.600
What's on Morrison?

26:41.700 --> 26:45.000
Abandoned construction site--
we'll dump her there.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.000
Shouldn't we find out
for ourselves what she knows?

26:52.100 --> 26:55.000
Nichols wants her out of the way???

27:19.300 --> 27:20.800
I understand your
deployment's stretched thin,

27:20.800 --> 27:22.500
but one of our own
agents is missing.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.600
That's a priority, too.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.600
Look, look, I don't care
where you find the men.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.000
Just get them out
there looking.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.700
I've never seen him like that.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.400
He looks like his head's
going to explode.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.600
Thank you.
Well, I'm not surprised.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.200
- Meaning?
- Meaning it's fairly obvious he has feelings for Renee.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.700
Why do you think that?

27:43.100 --> 27:45.200
Instinct--
I just know.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.700
Stay on task.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.700
General Juma says the American carrier
troop still has nobegun to withdraw.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.100
Well, they haven't launched
their invasion either.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.600
I gave this president a deadline
and it's almost past.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.100
Apparently, our demonstration
was not convincing enough.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.900
This woman is more
stubborn than we expected.

28:29.900 --> 28:33.300
Once she realizes we have
Matobo, she'll change her mind.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.700
And if she doesn't?

28:38.100 --> 28:39.700
You have the CIP module.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.200
Launch another attack.

28:43.600 --> 28:47.500
Let's see how stubborn she is after
American civilians start dying.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.900
- When will Matoboe here?
- Within an hour.

28:53.100 --> 28:53.800
What caused the delay?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.400
An FBI agent
got in the way.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.500
I needed to make sure she hadn't
compromised our operation.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
- And has she?
- No.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.700
As soon as my men
get rid of her,

29:01.700 --> 29:04.200
I'll pick up Matobo personally
and bring him to you.

29:21.300 --> 29:22.300
This friend of yours,

29:22.900 --> 29:25.400
so you're sure he's going to have
everything he needs to access the files?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.000
He said he didn't think
it'd be a problem.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Thank you, Brian.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.000
For all your help,
and your loyalty.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.300
You don't need
to thank me, sir.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.300
Yes, I do.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.400
You're risking a lot to do this,
especially after what happened this morning.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.800
You can thank me after we confirm
the information is on that drive.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.200
Said the key should be
under the mat.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.100
There it is.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.500
When will your friend be here?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.400
He should be here any minute.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.400
Would you mind turning on the air?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.200
- It's really hot in here.
- Of course, sir.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.100
It's Samantha and Roger.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.200
This is Samantha's apartment, sir.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.800
You.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.100
I'm sorry, sir.

30:43.900 --> 30:44.900
Why?

30:46.300 --> 30:49.000
Roger was looking into things
he shouldn't have.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.500
I tried to protect him, too,

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
but he wouldn't let me.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.900
inherited your determination.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.400
You killed my son.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
You...

31:10.500 --> 31:12.800
killed Roger.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.000
It's Tetradyzine, sir.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.700
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.900
Don't try to speak, the Tetradyzine
also paralyzes your vocal chords.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.300
If it's any consolation, sir,

31:41.800 --> 31:42.900
Roger died quickly.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.000
And I'm going to make sure...

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
you do, too.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.000
Situation here is in control.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.300
- Are you tracking Ms. Roth?
- Yeah.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.600
Time to get her back
to her apartment.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.600
- Are you sure this is going to work?
- It'll work fine.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.500
Mr. Taylor came to her apartment
to confront her about Roger.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.100
Lost his temper, killed her.

32:27.100 --> 32:28.600
Took his own life, okay?

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.900
I'll let you know
if there are any problems.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.200
I really am sorry, sir.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.200
If only you'd left
well enough alone.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.600
- Ms. Roth.
- Agent Vossler.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.800
Henry Taylor sent me.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.500
Mr. Taylor's been looking into
the matter you discussed.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.600
He believes you're
in imminent danger.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
My God...

33:16.100 --> 33:17.400
What am I supposed to do?

33:17.900 --> 33:19.800
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.400
Escort you to a safe house.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.100
- Now?
- My orders are to take you there immediately.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.100
We can stop at
your apartment first,

33:26.100 --> 33:27.900
so you can pack clothes,
essentials.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.100
Uh, I just need
to call my office.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.200
Not until we get you
locked down, ma'am.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.500
Please.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.100
Okay.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.300
???

33:58.900 --> 34:00.700
So it looks like your friend
from the A.G. is still here.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.400
- I know.
- What's going on?

34:02.500 --> 34:05.500
He wants to me about what Renee
did to Tanner in the hospital.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.300
What did Renee do to Tanner
at the hospital?

34:07.400 --> 34:10.800
I don't know, but Howell is
claiming she tortured Tanner.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.400
Renee?

34:12.600 --> 34:13.500
I don't believe that.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.500
Maybe you should.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.199
Tanner wasn't talking...

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
and she kicked me
out of the room.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.400
And then the next thing I know,
the alarm on his ventilator is going off.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.400
And Renee had
the information she needed?

34:24.500 --> 34:25.800
Mm-hmm.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.800
If you weren't in the room,
you don't have a problem.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.100
I do, actually-- she asked me
to stall his lawyers.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.400
And you did?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.699
- Yes.
- Come on, Gold.
What were you thinking?

34:39.800 --> 34:41.600
She gave me a direct order--
what was I supposed to do?

34:41.699 --> 34:43.199
Say no.

34:43.400 --> 34:47.400
Do you realize if they prove that
Renee tortured him you're an accessory?

34:47.600 --> 34:49.000
And Larry is not
gonna protect you.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.100
I know.

34:50.199 --> 34:54.400
Let's just hope the A.G. will have moved on
to something else when this is all over.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.900
I'm getting back to work.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.900
Agent Moss.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.200
- What do you want?
- Forgive my interruption,

35:13.300 --> 35:17.100
but it's just been brought to my
attention that Agent Walker is missing.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.400
Yes, she may have been abducted
by the same people responsible

35:22.400 --> 35:25.300
for kidnapping
Matobo and his wife.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.300
I'm very sorry to hear that.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.400
And want you to know that I appreciate the
enormous pressure that you and the Bureau are under.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.400
Glad to hear it.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.200
Nevertheless, the Attorney General
is still pressing for a full account

35:36.200 --> 35:39.900
of Agent Walker's handling of the
Tanner interrogation, and at this moment,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.900
Janis Gold is the only witness
available to me.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.400
She's not available
to you, Howell.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.600
I already told you,
she can't be spared right now.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.800
- I only need a short
time with her.
- You can't have her.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.900
Are you going to force me
to get the A.G. on the line?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.700
You've got to be kidding me. You really
want to press this right now?!

35:53.800 --> 35:56.100
We're in the middle of
an international crisis.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.100
- I'm aware of that.
- And all you seem
interested in

35:58.100 --> 36:00.800
is condemning the actions of
an agent who's in God-knows-what danger 

36:00.800 --> 36:02.400
just so you can nail her to the wall.

36:02.500 --> 36:06.300
If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines
and used illegal tactics to get information,

36:06.400 --> 36:07.900
then, yes, she will
be prosecuted.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.200
Then maybe you can let us get her back
first before you throw her to the wolves,

36:11.200 --> 36:14.200
I mean, if that's okay with you.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.700
- Yes?
- Larry?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.200
NSA just relayed a call
they intercepted to us.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.700
Renee was referenced.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.000
Referenced how?

36:26.100 --> 36:26.900
Janis?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I think you need to come
hear it yourself.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.800
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.200
We're not done here.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.700
Agent Moss!

36:38.700 --> 36:41.800
- Did you source it?
- Five minutes ago. It's legit.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.100
Check it again.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.100
I already did, twice.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.600
Where's the intercept code?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.500
Right there above
the decryption algorithm.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
They routed it to us
on a priority channel.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.300
Were we able to get
verbal confirmation?

36:52.300 --> 36:53.900
It's not going to change
the content of the call, Janis.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.700
I know, I just...

36:55.800 --> 36:58.100
What's on the NSA intercept?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.300
What? You said Renee
was referenced. What's on it?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
It's only a fragment,
but she's referenced, yeah.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.200
Enough to get a GPS fix?

37:04.300 --> 37:05.700
The clip's not even 27???seconds long.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.000
The best we can say
is that it's in the Metro area.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.000
Play it.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.200
- Emerson
- you were right,

37:14.300 --> 37:16.400
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.000
How much did Tanner spill?

37:18.100 --> 37:21.500
Other than the details of
Matobo's abduction, nothing.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.600
- You're sure?
- Walker is extraneous.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.700
Kill her before you get here.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.700
We'll be with you soon.
Be quick about it.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.400
Dubaku's anxious to get his
hands on the Prime Minister.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.900
When was this call made?

37:40.100 --> 37:42.400
Ten minutes ago.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.000
- Run a trace.
- I already did.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.600
Run it again!

38:06.000 --> 38:07.900
Jack.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
The ditch.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.900
Kill her.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.200
Tony.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.400
Step down.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.800
Step down!

38:50.900 --> 38:53.800
You could either walk
or I could drag you.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.800
You're really going to kill me?

39:03.700 --> 39:07.100
- I'm not going to beg
for my life, Jack.
- Good.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.200
So everything that you
told me was a lie?

39:23.200 --> 39:26.100
I'm doing what I have to.
I don't expect you to understand.

39:26.200 --> 39:30.100
I understand that you are
a traitor and a murderer.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.400
Turn around.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.500
No.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.800
You're going to have to look at me
when you pull that trigger.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.000
I said turn around.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.100
If you trust me, I will get you
through this alive.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.300
Get on your knees.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.700
For a second there, I didn't
thk you were going to do it.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.700
Now bury her.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.600
We're on a timetable.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.500
