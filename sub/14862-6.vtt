00:02.440 --> 00:05.104
- Previously on "Mistresses"... 
- I'm gonna need your notes

00:05.125 --> 00:07.083
in the months leading up
to Thomas Grey's death.

00:07.083 --> 00:08.552
You need to do this for both of us.

00:08.552 --> 00:10.620
(Karen) Fabricating notes could
cost me my medical license.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.847
This that you're wearing... 
it's not suitable for an office.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.348
(Josslyn) How am I
gonna work with this guy?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.717
I had a system with
Mac, you know, a method.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.285
- A rhythm?
- Funny.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.721
(April) I've never done an
impulsive thing in my life.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.324
There's still time.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.895
I don't regret what happened that night.

00:28.895 --> 00:32.899
I'm pregnant, Harry, but
it might not be yours.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.468
So when you say "everything"... everything.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.270
- You told him you're pregnant?
- Yes.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.571
That you cheated on him?

00:38.571 --> 00:40.106
- Yes.
- That it was with Dominic,

00:40.106 --> 00:41.574
and you don't know who the father is yet?

00:41.574 --> 00:43.510
Yes and yes.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.682
So what did Harry say?

00:48.682 --> 00:50.383
He didn't say anything.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.752
He left to go to work, and
I haven't seen him since.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.357
And I took a paternity test... 

00:57.357 --> 00:59.325
- You what?
- But I don't have the results back yet.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.394
- Harry agreed to that?
- No.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.196
I took his razor for the D.N.A.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.431
I know.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.366
I know. It's terrible.

01:06.366 --> 01:10.303
But apparently, I do terrible things.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.739
We brought you doughnuts.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.174
I can't eat right now.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.710
You're pregnant. You can
eat whatever you want.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.245
Okay, uh, I haven't told Joss yet. Okay?

01:19.245 --> 01:21.514
So please don't say anything.
I'm just not ready to tell her.

01:21.655 --> 01:23.724
Good morning, beautiful ladies.

01:23.724 --> 01:25.659
What's up?

01:29.730 --> 01:31.365
I slept with Richard last night.

01:31.365 --> 01:32.800
(Gasps) Fantastic!

01:32.800 --> 01:34.668
- You what?
- In the store,

01:34.668 --> 01:37.671
on a bed that costs $699, plus tax.

01:37.671 --> 01:39.373
(Women laugh)

01:39.373 --> 01:41.375
Wow. That is so not you.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.344
I know. That's why it was so great.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.546
At least I think it was great.

01:45.546 --> 01:46.780
I haven't had sex in so long.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.349
I'm not sure I'd know the difference.

01:48.349 --> 01:50.718
Oh, no, no, no. You would
know if it wasn't great.

01:50.718 --> 01:52.486
Like with Mac... he was
kind of lame at the office,

01:52.486 --> 01:54.788
but the sex with him was amazing

01:54.788 --> 01:56.590
and so were my listings.

01:56.590 --> 01:59.560
God, life was so much
easier when he was my boss.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.895
Shoot. Ugh.

02:00.895 --> 02:03.564
I gotta go. I gotta open up the store.

02:03.564 --> 02:04.999
(Kisses) (Josslyn) Yeah,
I better take off, too.

02:04.999 --> 02:08.002
There are houses waiting
to be sold. (Kisses)

02:08.002 --> 02:10.003
Actually... 

02:10.003 --> 02:12.039

Of course she took the only jelly doughnut.

Do you think they know we're watching them?

02:32.259 --> 02:34.028
The guy just waved at me between thrusts.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.863
Yeah, I... I think they know.

02:35.863 --> 02:38.265
I can't watch. Mona,
they're making a porno.

02:38.265 --> 02:41.635
The whole point is so you
can watch over and over again.

02:41.635 --> 02:42.903
They're just two people having sex.

02:42.903 --> 02:44.038
We've all done it before.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.373
I've never done that before.

02:46.373 --> 02:48.542
- Oh, that's called the siberian husky.
- (Door opens)

02:49.576 --> 02:50.778
Oh.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.717
Sorry to use your office, but
they're making an adult film

02:56.717 --> 02:59.386
across the street, and this
is by far the best view.

02:59.386 --> 03:02.323
Oh, come on. Two naked
people, extremely bad lighting.

03:02.323 --> 03:04.425
- You're really not interested?
- You can leave now, Josslyn,

03:04.425 --> 03:06.293
and please take Mona with you.

03:06.293 --> 03:08.462
Fine. But can we talk about
the James property first?

03:08.462 --> 03:09.964
Not now.

03:09.964 --> 03:12.032
Not now.

03:12.032 --> 03:14.668
(Groans) Mona.

03:19.039 --> 03:22.376
Are you planning to stay up
here all day, torturing yourself?

03:22.376 --> 03:23.844
I'm not torturing myself.

03:23.844 --> 03:26.847
I'm just looking at old pictures.

03:26.847 --> 03:28.382
Oh, wow!

03:28.382 --> 03:29.383
(Laughs)

03:29.383 --> 03:32.786
(Laughs) Us in Australia.

03:32.786 --> 03:34.621
Remember those days when we were young

03:34.621 --> 03:37.358
and wore bikinis all the time
without worrying about it?

03:37.358 --> 03:39.293
Vaguely.

03:39.293 --> 03:40.394
- Remember that?
- Mm.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.363
That was the day we met Harry.

03:42.363 --> 03:44.298
He came over to talk to us on the beach.

03:44.298 --> 03:46.567
You mean talk to you. He was so in lust,

03:46.567 --> 03:50.337
I think it took him two
days to finally notice me.

03:50.337 --> 03:51.438
(Clicks tongue)

03:51.438 --> 03:54.308
This isn't helping anything.

03:56.010 --> 03:58.345
You just need to give him time

03:58.345 --> 04:00.347
and let him come to you when he's ready.

04:03.484 --> 04:06.520
I... I really hope that you're right.

04:09.656 --> 04:12.559
Are you still working with Elizabeth Grey?

04:12.559 --> 04:16.296
Yeah. I'm her point person. Why?

04:16.296 --> 04:18.332
I think you might be getting a call today

04:18.332 --> 04:20.801
from the insurance company.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.669
I turned over my notes on Thomas,

04:22.669 --> 04:26.669
which states that he was
ready to end his life, so... 

04:27.608 --> 04:30.310
Sorry if that's costing
your firm a big commission.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.279
N... no. Don't worry about it.

04:32.419 --> 04:34.388
Is there any way you could just let me know

04:34.388 --> 04:35.923
when the call comes through?

04:35.923 --> 04:37.891
I'll feel so much better when
this whole investigation's over.

04:37.891 --> 04:39.593
Of course.

04:39.593 --> 04:42.396
I'm leaving you now, but no more pictures.

04:42.396 --> 04:43.463
Okay.

04:43.463 --> 04:44.398
Call me if you need me.

04:44.398 --> 04:46.633

- Officer, this is Dr. Kim.
- Morning, doctor.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.796
Someone broke into the
office early this morning.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.065
- The alarm company called.
- What happened?

07:46.065 --> 07:47.600
- It looks like... 
- Well, we think they stole a key card

07:47.600 --> 07:49.168
and used it to get inside the building.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.037
That's pretty much the theory.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.072
Dr. Kim, is it okay if I take the day off?

07:53.072 --> 07:54.507
I... I'm feeling a little rattled.

07:54.507 --> 07:55.541
That's fine, Lila.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.913
It doesn't appear anything was taken,

08:00.913 --> 08:03.049
but you should look around just in case.

08:03.049 --> 08:06.052
It seems your office was the one targeted.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.755
Is something wrong, doctor?

08:09.755 --> 08:12.825
My computer's on, and I always
shut it off before I leave.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.627
Any chance you could've forgotten?

08:14.627 --> 08:17.263
I suppose, but I don't think so.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.631
Anything valuable on there?

08:18.631 --> 08:20.600
All the patient files are on the server.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.801
You got any famous patients?

08:21.801 --> 08:23.669
Maybe someone looking
for some dirt on them?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.805
We can't really give you any
information about our patients.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.107
I know. Just trying to be thorough.

08:28.107 --> 08:32.178
So if someone did copy
something from the computers,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.514
there's no way to tell, is there?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.115
Not if they were smart, no.

08:36.115 --> 08:39.885
Look, best guess is they came
in here for your electronics,

08:39.885 --> 08:42.554
maybe looking for some
cash, tripped the alarm,

08:42.554 --> 08:45.191
got panicked, and took off. I
wouldn't worry if I were you.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.194

09:35.207 --> 09:37.109
This is really all you can afford?

09:37.109 --> 09:39.211
Right now, it is. Take it or leave it.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.114
What am I supposed to do with a $100 check?

and you're still not here

10:35.067 --> 10:36.802
and you're not picking up your phone,

10:36.802 --> 10:38.904
which leads me to believe
you're not coming home,

10:38.904 --> 10:41.774
which I totally understand.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.743
Uh... 

10:43.823 --> 10:45.758
I just don't know how
I can make things better

10:45.758 --> 10:47.193
if you won't talk to me.

10:47.193 --> 10:50.129
♪  ... quiet like a clown ♪

10:50.129 --> 10:51.564
Uh... 

10:51.664 --> 10:53.666
I'm kinda going crazy waiting for you,

10:53.666 --> 10:55.301
so I'm gonna go into the
office for a little bit.

10:55.301 --> 10:57.903
I... if you get home and
you want to talk to me,

10:57.903 --> 10:59.939
just call me, and I'll rush back.

10:59.939 --> 11:01.373
(Inhales deeply)

11:01.373 --> 11:03.142
Okay.

11:03.142 --> 11:04.877
Bye.

11:04.877 --> 11:08.047

11:08.047 --> 11:09.448
(Telephone rings)

11:09.448 --> 11:12.151
Hey. (Ring)

11:13.492 --> 11:15.461
What is with all the pouty faces?

11:15.461 --> 11:17.997
Did they cancel "Pretty Little Liars"?

11:17.997 --> 11:19.965
You know who is making everyone stay late

11:19.965 --> 11:22.368
because we wasted time watching live porn.

11:22.368 --> 11:24.069
I got this one.

11:24.069 --> 11:26.805
And you can say his name,
Mona. He's not Voldemort.

11:26.805 --> 11:28.374
(Sighs)

11:29.375 --> 11:31.276
They didn't do anything wrong. I did.

11:31.276 --> 11:33.412
If you have to punish someone, punish me.

11:33.412 --> 11:35.447
Did you physically force
them to come into my office

11:35.447 --> 11:37.916
and watch two strangers having sex?

11:37.916 --> 11:40.386
No. But I did send out

11:40.386 --> 11:42.988
a mass e-mail with an attachment.

11:42.988 --> 11:45.024
Your selflessness is commendable,

11:45.024 --> 11:47.793
but everyone is staying, including you.

11:47.793 --> 11:51.830
Look, I know you're pissed,
so let's just get it out there.

11:54.099 --> 11:55.834
Do I seem angry to you?

11:57.202 --> 11:58.937
Ugh. Actually, no.

11:58.937 --> 12:01.507
You seem like a robot incapable of emotion,

12:01.507 --> 12:03.308
and if you don't let it out,

12:03.308 --> 12:04.476
you're gonna explode really soon.

12:04.476 --> 12:06.345
You're like a giant French pressure cooker.

12:06.345 --> 12:08.113
Just yell at me.

12:08.113 --> 12:09.815
I don't need to yell at you.

12:09.815 --> 12:12.217
What I need is for you to read this

12:12.217 --> 12:14.353
and then convince a lovely Italian couple

12:14.353 --> 12:17.222
to give you the listing tomorrow.

12:17.222 --> 12:20.926
This is a little beneath my pay grade.

12:20.926 --> 12:21.927
Come on.

12:21.927 --> 12:23.195
You're wasting my talent.

12:27.132 --> 12:28.901
Thank you for the warning,

12:28.901 --> 12:30.569
but I'll take my chances.

12:34.573 --> 12:36.241
(Exhales)

12:39.078 --> 12:40.179
Okay.

12:40.179 --> 12:41.280
(Knocks on door)

12:42.571 --> 12:45.574
Uh, let me call you back
when I have more info.

12:45.574 --> 12:47.009
Great. Thanks.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.245
Hi. What's going on?

12:50.245 --> 12:53.148
I just heard Felker's retiring.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.517
And, uh, with him leaving
and Thomas Grey dying,

12:55.517 --> 12:58.253
partner spots are opening
up big-time around here.

12:58.253 --> 13:00.389
And I just happen to know that you and I

13:00.389 --> 13:03.091
are on top of the short list.

13:03.091 --> 13:05.527
Is that really why you came in here?

13:05.527 --> 13:09.231
To share watercooler gossip with me?

13:17.039 --> 13:19.041
You know why I came in.

13:19.041 --> 13:20.976
I just want to know if you thought any more

13:20.976 --> 13:24.413
about what I said the other
day about how you and I and... 

13:24.413 --> 13:28.383
what we did, uh, that it
wasn't a random thing, Savannah.

13:28.383 --> 13:31.253
I can't... I can't do this right now.

13:31.253 --> 13:32.621
It's no problem. Just, you and I both know

13:32.621 --> 13:35.457
that you're just gonna come
up with an excuse later on.

13:35.457 --> 13:37.326
Okay, uh... 

13:37.326 --> 13:39.595
Yes, I thought about it.

13:42.331 --> 13:44.032
But it doesn't matter.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.339
I'm pregnant... 

13:52.507 --> 13:54.610
and it's Harry's.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.380
So, uh... 

13:59.648 --> 14:02.551
there's just nothing to talk about anymore.

14:22.537 --> 14:24.273
(Telephone rings)

14:26.923 --> 14:29.292
Hey. Have you seen the specs on the... 

14:29.292 --> 14:32.695
- why are you googling Olivier?
- Shh! Keep it down, megaphone.

14:32.695 --> 14:34.230
He doesn't need to know about it.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.198
I just need to figure out what
makes this guy tick. (Keys clack)

14:36.198 --> 14:38.634
Oh. So you can have
sex with this boss, too?

14:38.634 --> 14:41.070
I have no desire to have
sex with that French fry.

14:41.070 --> 14:42.672
Just need to manipulate him,

14:42.672 --> 14:45.207
and I can't do that
unless I understand him.

14:45.207 --> 14:47.243
You don't have to manipulate everything.

14:47.243 --> 14:49.912
Can't you just be like me
and just go with the flow?

14:49.912 --> 14:52.815
Ugh. I can't be like
you for so many reasons.

14:52.815 --> 14:55.985
(Sighs) Olivier is totally
hindering my success.

14:55.985 --> 14:57.219
Before he came along,

14:57.219 --> 14:58.754
I was selling properties left and right.

14:58.754 --> 15:01.057
Put on a nice outfit, steal
some of my sister's jewelry,

15:01.057 --> 15:02.191
turn on the charm. (Snaps fingers)

15:02.191 --> 15:03.793
Multiple offers. Done.

15:03.793 --> 15:05.728
Is that really how you work?

15:05.728 --> 15:07.930
But now he's taking money out of my pocket.

15:07.930 --> 15:10.967
He's thwarting me. I'm
totally being thwarted, Mona.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.868
Hey, look at that. It
says he's a fitness freak

15:12.868 --> 15:16.672
who eats one banana a day to
keep up his potassium levels.

15:16.672 --> 15:18.988
Do you think his chest is hairy?

15:18.988 --> 15:21.024
Oh. And we're done here.

15:22.992 --> 15:25.128
So you went to see Harry at
the restaurant, and then went

15:25.128 --> 15:27.770
and told Dominic you're
pregnant with Harry's baby?

15:28.192 --> 15:30.633
- Yep.
- Do you listen to anything I say to you?

15:30.208 --> 15:31.610
It was the best way I could think of

15:31.610 --> 15:33.378
to get Dom to leave me alone,

15:33.378 --> 15:36.248
especially if I have to
see him every day at work.

15:36.248 --> 15:38.450
I'm just so frustrated with him.

15:38.450 --> 15:39.584
With Dominic?

15:39.584 --> 15:41.620
No, with Harry. Keep up.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.522
He won't even talk to me.

15:43.522 --> 15:45.590
Savi, you have to remember

15:45.590 --> 15:49.161
that you've been dealing
with this for weeks.

15:49.161 --> 15:51.596
Harry just found out.
He really does need time.

15:51.596 --> 15:54.099
Well, it's a good thing
I went there when I did,

15:54.099 --> 15:56.535
because otherwise I
wouldn't have found out... 

15:56.535 --> 15:59.604
That he is sleeping
with his slutty hostess.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.573
- What?
- Yeah. Kyra.

16:01.573 --> 16:03.575
With the fun bags.

16:03.575 --> 16:05.410
Kyra with the fun bags.

16:05.410 --> 16:07.312
He actually told you he slept with her?

16:07.312 --> 16:09.581
No, but it was so obvious.

16:09.581 --> 16:12.284
Savi, don't take this the wrong way,

16:12.284 --> 16:14.619
but you're acting a little crazy right now.

16:14.619 --> 16:17.422
Harry would never sleep
with someone out of revenge.

16:17.422 --> 16:18.657
(Grunts) It's just not who he is.

16:18.657 --> 16:22.093
Maybe we should change the subject.

16:22.093 --> 16:24.329
Yeah. That's a good idea.

16:25.564 --> 16:28.400
There was a break-in at
my office this morning.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.602
- What?
- No. It's... it's... don't worry. It's fine.

16:30.602 --> 16:32.571
Nothing was taken.

16:32.571 --> 16:36.441
It's just weird timing with this
investigation still going on.

16:36.441 --> 16:38.109
Do you think it's related?

16:38.109 --> 16:40.078
I don't know what to think.

16:41.446 --> 16:44.449
Well, the call from the insurance
company did come through.

16:44.449 --> 16:46.251
We're just waiting for
Elizabeth to return our call,

16:46.251 --> 16:48.420
which she hasn't yet.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.588
Isn't that weird?

16:49.588 --> 16:51.723
Mm, not necessarily.
It's only been 24 hours.

16:51.723 --> 16:55.293
The woman just found out
she's not getting $10 million,

16:55.293 --> 16:57.562
and she doesn't have five
minutes to call you back?

16:57.562 --> 17:01.562
You know what? When you put it that way,

17:02.033 --> 17:03.602
- it's weird.
- It's weird.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.358
Yep. I'm gonna get a snack.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.361
- What happened?
- I am so sorry,

18:03.361 --> 18:05.630
but the babysitter
canceled at the last minute.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.332
Looks like our "school function"

18:07.332 --> 18:08.600
will have to wait until another night.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.268
Oh, that's okay.

18:10.268 --> 18:12.671
I'm a little drained from
my meeting with Miranda.

18:12.671 --> 18:14.706
What about tomorrow afternoon?
The girls are at school.

18:14.706 --> 18:16.374
I could take you somewhere for lunch.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.511
That actually sounds great.

18:19.511 --> 18:21.580
Fantastic.

18:21.580 --> 18:25.150
And I was gonna say "fun."

18:25.150 --> 18:27.085
When I opened the door?

18:27.085 --> 18:29.120
"Who's ready for a night of fun?"

18:29.120 --> 18:31.289
Oh. Bummer.

18:33.258 --> 18:34.559
(Harry speaks indistinctly)

18:34.559 --> 18:37.395
You did a great, great job, guys.

18:37.455 --> 18:41.760
Uh, anyway, we'll have a
beer tomorrow. Get some rest.

18:44.496 --> 18:47.232
Okay. So you didn't come home

18:47.232 --> 18:48.533
and you're obviously not ready

18:48.533 --> 18:50.468
to talk to me, and I totally get it,

18:50.468 --> 18:53.438
but please, do me a favor and listen to me.

18:53.438 --> 18:57.175
And then if you still don't
want to talk to me, it's okay.

19:02.514 --> 19:04.249
Talk.

19:04.249 --> 19:08.249
Okay, uh, so I've been
thinking a lot about what to do.

19:09.788 --> 19:13.258
And I know we're not
gonna fix this in one day,

19:13.258 --> 19:15.226
but... 

19:15.226 --> 19:19.064
I have a suggestion that I
think might be a good start.

19:19.064 --> 19:21.232
Which is?

19:21.232 --> 19:23.668
I'll quit my job.

19:23.668 --> 19:26.504
Look for another law firm to work at.

19:26.504 --> 19:28.773
I'll be someplace new,

19:28.773 --> 19:30.775
and we can set it up that
I'm working less hours

19:30.775 --> 19:34.679
so you and I can spend more time together.

19:34.679 --> 19:36.381
No more... 

19:36.381 --> 19:39.451
ships passing in the night.

19:47.425 --> 19:49.427
What do you think?

19:51.563 --> 19:54.566
You do what you wanna do.

19:57.235 --> 19:58.403
Okay.

20:01.239 --> 20:02.707
Uh, so I'll do it.

20:05.076 --> 20:07.812
And this way, you can stop doing that.

20:14.552 --> 20:17.422
Don't turn this on me, Savi.

20:17.422 --> 20:19.691
I don't sleep with people I work with.

20:32.881 --> 20:35.817
Hi, Elizabeth. It's Karen Kim, again.

20:37.312 --> 20:38.647
I did what you asked me to do

20:38.647 --> 20:41.049
so we could both move on with our lives,

20:41.049 --> 20:43.719
and now you're not returning
any of my phone calls.

20:43.719 --> 20:46.221
I need to know what's going on.

20:46.221 --> 20:48.490
Call me. Please.

Hey. Hey.

21:15.717 --> 21:17.553
Uh, what are you doing here?

21:17.553 --> 21:18.720
Looking for a dress to wear.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.656
One that says "hey, I'm casual and cute

21:20.656 --> 21:22.324
and ready for a lunch date,"

21:22.324 --> 21:24.026
but also says, "wow. I'm really hot."

21:24.026 --> 21:25.027
Oh.

21:25.027 --> 21:26.061
What are you looking for?

21:26.061 --> 21:27.763
Oh, me? Nothing.

21:27.763 --> 21:29.531
I'm just... I'm browsing. (Chuckles)

21:29.531 --> 21:31.166
I love to browse.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.068
It's like window-shopping
without the heat.

21:33.068 --> 21:35.404
Yeah. Are you okay?

21:35.404 --> 21:38.273
What? I'm... I'm fine.
I'm... I'm totally fine.

21:38.273 --> 21:39.441
I'm fine.

21:39.441 --> 21:41.476
Okay, you can't tell her I told you,

21:41.476 --> 21:43.245
but Savi's pregnant.

21:43.245 --> 21:44.446
What?

21:44.446 --> 21:46.448
- Mm-hmm.
- Savi told you she was pregnant?

21:46.448 --> 21:48.050
Oh, no. That wench didn't tell me anything,

21:48.050 --> 21:51.053
but I found one of those,
um, "What to expect" books.

21:51.053 --> 21:52.554
- Harry gave it to her.
- Oh.

21:52.554 --> 21:54.556
Isn't this incredible?

21:54.556 --> 21:57.559
Oh, Harry must be so proud of
his little Australian sperm.

21:57.559 --> 22:00.329
But don't say anything until she tells you.

22:00.329 --> 22:01.430
Oh.

22:01.430 --> 22:04.299
I won't say anything about any sperm.

22:04.299 --> 22:08.299
And how great is this?

22:10.105 --> 22:13.108
Of course. That's the first
thing you'd buy for the baby.

22:13.108 --> 22:16.612
April, I'm still shopping.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.237
(Elevator bell dings, cell phone rings)

22:25.117 --> 22:26.100
Hey.

22:26.101 --> 22:29.612
Okay, I can't talk right now,
but Joss knows you're pregnant.

22:29.452 --> 22:31.288
She found your book from Harry
and she called you a wench,

22:31.288 --> 22:32.355
so you better tell her soon.

22:32.355 --> 22:34.090
Great.

22:34.090 --> 22:36.526
This is not something I
can deal with right now.

22:36.526 --> 22:38.595
You didn't tell her you know, did you?

22:38.595 --> 22:40.297
No, I didn't say anything.

22:40.297 --> 22:42.299
Oh, I better go. She's looking for me.

22:51.868 --> 22:53.203
Can I help you?

22:53.203 --> 22:55.538
Yes, uh, my name's Dr. Kim.

22:55.538 --> 22:58.441
I'm here to talk to Mrs. Grey.

22:58.441 --> 22:59.576
It's somewhat important.

22:59.576 --> 23:02.278
I'm sorry. Mrs. grey isn't here.

23:02.278 --> 23:03.780
Do you know what time she'll be back?

23:03.780 --> 23:05.815
I can wait, if that's okay.

23:05.815 --> 23:07.650
Mrs. grey is out of the country.

23:07.650 --> 23:11.650
She left last night for Italy
and she has no set return date.

23:12.455 --> 23:16.459
I can leave her a message
for when she gets back.

23:16.459 --> 23:18.261
No.

23:18.261 --> 23:19.529
That's okay.

23:19.529 --> 23:20.864
Thank you.

23:25.502 --> 23:26.503
Hi.

23:26.503 --> 23:28.638
Wow. You look amazing.

23:28.638 --> 23:29.839
Thank you.

23:29.839 --> 23:32.342
Come on in. Let me just get my keys.

23:33.576 --> 23:35.445
Do you plan on telling
me where we're going?

23:35.445 --> 23:37.580
Is this like a picnic? 'Cause I
really don't do outdoorsy stuff.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.482
It's more of a white people's thing.

23:39.482 --> 23:42.452
- I also don't do surprises. You should know this about me.
- Okay. Deep breath.

23:42.452 --> 23:43.586
We're going to a Dodgers game.

23:43.586 --> 23:44.587
I brought some homemade sandwiches.

23:44.587 --> 23:47.123
Uh, we have our own box.

23:47.123 --> 23:48.625
Is that all right? Or do
you not like baseball either?

23:48.625 --> 23:50.660
Oh, I love baseball.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.529
And a box. Fancy you.

23:52.529 --> 23:54.464
Yeah, fancy me.

23:54.464 --> 23:56.599
It's my boss', so fancy him, but... 

23:56.599 --> 24:00.570
Let me just change my shoes.

24:03.807 --> 24:04.841
Sorry.

24:04.841 --> 24:07.377
Am I interrupting something?

24:10.847 --> 24:14.851
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

24:14.851 --> 24:16.686
Can I talk to you for a minute?

24:16.686 --> 24:18.254
What's the matter with you?

24:18.254 --> 24:19.622
Oh, that's what I was about to ask you.

24:19.622 --> 24:21.558
Yeah, I just got a call from Leonard Riche

24:21.558 --> 24:22.792
over at Myers and Oakley.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.894
Ugh. That was fast.

24:24.894 --> 24:26.729
So it's true? You... you
really went over there

24:26.729 --> 24:29.532
to interview for a job, as
what, a junior associate?

24:29.532 --> 24:30.800
It's complicated, okay?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.836
I'm... I'm just putting
feelers out there right now.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.337
Yeah, well, when Mitchell finds out,

24:34.337 --> 24:35.672
the only feeling you're
gonna be getting is fired.

24:35.672 --> 24:37.707
Well, I'm assuming
you're not gonna tell him.

24:37.707 --> 24:39.676
Savannah, you've worked here for ten years,

24:39.676 --> 24:41.377
built a reputation, you climbed the ladder

24:41.377 --> 24:42.645
till you're, like, five
minutes from partner.

24:42.645 --> 24:44.380
- And you're just gonna throw it all away...
- Dominic.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.282
- To go work at some mediocre firm?
- I have to.

24:46.282 --> 24:48.251
No, you don't. You're a great lawyer.

24:48.251 --> 24:50.854
Being here is what's best
for you and your career.

24:50.854 --> 24:52.622
Being here makes me feel like

24:52.622 --> 24:55.425
I am betraying my husband every single day.

24:55.425 --> 24:57.794
Okay, and if what you said is right,

24:57.794 --> 25:02.365
if... if what we did isn't entirely random,

25:02.365 --> 25:04.234
then I'm not sure being around each other

25:04.234 --> 25:06.503
is the best idea either.

25:10.206 --> 25:12.742
I know what you said,
but I thought about it,

25:12.742 --> 25:14.711
and this payment plan
isn't gonna work for me.

25:14.711 --> 25:16.679
It's not gonna work for you?

25:16.679 --> 25:18.581
No. I don't need a monthly reminder

25:18.581 --> 25:19.749
of what I've been through,

25:19.749 --> 25:20.884
and Scottie's gonna get older,

25:20.884 --> 25:22.685
and he's gonna start asking questions.

25:22.685 --> 25:24.220
I... I need to protect my son.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.289
I told you, this is the best I can do.

25:26.289 --> 25:29.159
I've done nothing but
try and help you, Miranda.

25:29.159 --> 25:32.395
I'm sure you believe that.

25:32.395 --> 25:34.531
What's that supposed to mean?

25:34.531 --> 25:36.666
Well, you tell me that you
can't give me any money,

25:36.666 --> 25:39.402
but you seem to be doing
pretty good right now.

25:39.402 --> 25:40.870
Your... your house is amazing.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.339
Your shop is doing really well.
How much did that dress cost?

25:43.339 --> 25:46.342
Hold on. You are in no
position to judge me.

25:46.342 --> 25:48.678
Right. 'Cause I'm just the whore
who slept with your husband.

25:48.678 --> 25:51.347
- You said it, not me.
- So this is my fault?

25:51.347 --> 25:53.183
You were the one who
slept with a married man

25:53.183 --> 25:56.586
and had a child with him,
so I know it's not my fault.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.288
You need to leave.

25:58.288 --> 25:59.756
You act like this nice, sweet person,

25:59.756 --> 26:01.791
like you're some kind of
Saint who's trying her best

26:01.791 --> 26:03.893
to help poor me, but it's all fake.

26:03.893 --> 26:07.330
I don't owe you anything. It was
my husband that died, not yours.

26:07.330 --> 26:08.831
Right. You've made that clear.

26:08.831 --> 26:10.400
You know, you're not as
noble as you like to think.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.768
It's not that you can't help me.

26:11.768 --> 26:13.536
It's that you don't want to help me.

26:13.536 --> 26:15.371
Get out of my house right now.

26:15.371 --> 26:17.407
Get out!

26:28.383 --> 26:29.484
- Hi!
- Hello.

26:29.484 --> 26:31.319
How are you? I'm Josslyn Carver,

26:31.319 --> 26:34.322
and you need to let me sell your house.

26:34.322 --> 26:35.623
I'm Maria. Nice to meet you.

26:35.623 --> 26:38.659
Nice to meet you. Questo
giardino e fantastico.

26:38.659 --> 26:41.195
Grazie. Grazie. Parli italiano?

26:41.195 --> 26:42.230
Si.

26:42.230 --> 26:43.364
Que brava.

26:43.364 --> 26:44.532
(Speaks Italian)

26:44.532 --> 26:47.301
Si. Aspetta attimo.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.436
(Speaks Italian)

26:48.436 --> 26:50.571
No, I know the info packet said no photos,

26:50.571 --> 26:53.975
but oh, this place is just too good not to.

26:53.975 --> 26:55.343
I'm sorry. I'm not sure it's a good idea.

26:55.343 --> 26:58.112
My husband... he may not approve and... 

26:58.112 --> 27:00.615
Oh. Please. Look at you,
especially in that blouse.

27:00.615 --> 27:03.651
I'm sure your husband does
whatever you tell him to.

27:03.651 --> 27:05.453
(Laughs)

27:05.453 --> 27:07.422
- Sometimes.
- Hmm.

27:07.422 --> 27:09.290
Hi. This is Kyra calling
from Savannah's kitchen

27:09.290 --> 27:11.426
to confirm your reservation with us.

27:11.426 --> 27:15.329
For 4 for 8:00? See you then.

27:17.665 --> 27:20.068
Do you ever actually go home?

27:20.068 --> 27:22.703
Someone needs to keep
this place running, right?

27:22.703 --> 27:25.706
Yeah. (Chuckles) Well,
don't let me get in your way.

27:25.706 --> 27:27.408
I'm just dropping off the new menus.

27:27.408 --> 27:29.243
Pretend I'm not here.

You don't have to pretend around me.

Kyra, I, uh, I appreciate the concern,

27:43.024 --> 27:44.325
I really do, but I'm okay.

27:44.325 --> 27:46.694
I just wanted you to know

27:46.694 --> 27:48.596
I'm here for you.

27:48.596 --> 27:51.365

Yeah, I have no doubt.

27:53.267 --> 27:55.970
I'm just... I'm not in the
mood to talk right now, okay?

27:55.970 --> 27:57.705
Okay. I get it.

27:57.705 --> 28:00.441
But can you do me a favor?

28:00.441 --> 28:01.676
What's that?

28:01.676 --> 28:04.445
Can you not sleep on
that couch again tonight?

28:04.445 --> 28:06.347
It's awful for your back.

28:06.347 --> 28:08.282
If you need a place to crash,

28:08.282 --> 28:10.318
there's a ton of room at my place.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.288
for you to go to a baseball game.

28:47.288 --> 28:49.023
Sure it is.

28:49.023 --> 28:51.125
April, you just had a crazy fight

28:51.125 --> 28:53.194
with your dead husband's mistress.

28:53.194 --> 28:55.429
I... I don't think we can
just go to a Dodger game.

if you want to get out of here

29:01.969 --> 29:03.337
and never come back.

29:03.337 --> 29:04.472
Why would I do that?

29:04.472 --> 29:06.174
Remember your whole speech

29:06.174 --> 29:08.276
about not getting sucked into
the vortex of another woman?

29:08.276 --> 29:11.179
Well, this vortex just
keeps getting deeper.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.115
Come here.

29:14.115 --> 29:15.183
Come here.

29:17.952 --> 29:19.220
(Clears throat)

29:19.220 --> 29:22.156
It's too late for that. I'm in.

29:22.156 --> 29:24.292
Your vortex is my vortex,

29:24.292 --> 29:26.093
so to speak.

29:26.093 --> 29:28.162
You don't have to be happy
around me all the time.

29:28.162 --> 29:30.331
Trust that I can handle this.

29:30.331 --> 29:34.135
I'm glad you can, because
I don't think I can.

29:34.135 --> 29:37.338
This whole thing has been
such a nightmare, and... 

29:37.338 --> 29:39.340
and the worst part is, she's right.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.408
About what?

29:40.408 --> 29:42.276
I don't want to give her the money.

29:42.276 --> 29:43.277
I don't like her.

29:43.277 --> 29:46.080
I actually think I hate her. I do.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.315
I hate her for showing up

29:47.315 --> 29:49.350
and ruining the memory of my marriage

29:49.350 --> 29:51.619
and for making me rearrange
my entire life for her.

29:51.619 --> 29:53.221
She just came here

29:53.221 --> 29:55.990
and upended everything like it was nothing.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.292
Well, maybe you're supposed
to send her away with nothing.

29:58.292 --> 30:00.928
I want to, but I feel guilty.

30:00.928 --> 30:02.330
I know how blessed I am.

30:02.330 --> 30:04.665
I have really good friends,
a fantastic daughter,

30:04.665 --> 30:06.701
my own shop,

30:06.701 --> 30:08.569
and I'm dating a guy like you.

30:10.137 --> 30:11.339
Hmm.

30:11.339 --> 30:13.641
You consider me a blessing?

30:17.912 --> 30:20.381
(Sighs) I... this makes no sense.

30:20.381 --> 30:22.383
I rocked that thing. She loved me.

30:22.383 --> 30:24.285
I am thrilled that you have a new friend,

30:24.285 --> 30:26.187
but what you don't have is the listing.

30:26.187 --> 30:27.588
Did you read the information packet?

30:27.588 --> 30:28.923
Of course I did.

30:28.923 --> 30:30.391
And yet, you still took pictures.

30:30.391 --> 30:32.226
Look, I know it says
no photos on the inside,

30:32.226 --> 30:35.363
but we needed them to sell it,
and Maria was totally on board.

30:35.363 --> 30:38.432
Alas, her husband, a
very private man, was not.

30:38.432 --> 30:41.102
(Chuckles) This was my mistake.

30:41.102 --> 30:43.437
I knew who you were and
I had a lapse in judgment.

30:43.437 --> 30:46.173
It won't happen again.

30:46.173 --> 30:49.143
You have no idea who I am.

30:49.143 --> 30:51.312
Oh, in fact, I do.

30:51.312 --> 30:54.148
You are the person who
thinks her way is the only way

30:54.148 --> 30:57.218
and that everyone else
needs to see that as well.

30:57.218 --> 31:01.055
So you use your charm,
your worldliness, your legs,

31:01.055 --> 31:02.523
to get what you want.

31:02.603 --> 31:05.606
In life, rules do not
apply to Josslyn Carver.

31:05.606 --> 31:07.208
Am I right?

31:07.208 --> 31:09.543
Usually my way's the best way.

31:09.543 --> 31:11.278
For you, yes,

31:11.278 --> 31:13.581
but not always for everyone else.

31:13.681 --> 31:16.150
Oh.

31:16.150 --> 31:18.786
And I did not have to Google
you to figure that out.

31:21.422 --> 31:22.690
Oh.

31:23.824 --> 31:25.759
Freaking Mona.

31:31.465 --> 31:33.434
So there's this hip-hop
dance class after school

31:33.434 --> 31:35.302
that everyone's taking, and
I really want to take it, too,

31:35.302 --> 31:37.671
- but it costs money, and I... 
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

31:37.671 --> 31:39.573
All I heard was "class" and "money."

31:39.573 --> 31:42.243
Okay. It's a dance class,
and it only costs $100,

31:42.243 --> 31:45.212
but it's worth it, because after
I'll be a really good dancer.

31:45.212 --> 31:48.382
So please, please, please, please, please?

31:48.382 --> 31:50.284
Okay, you can do it.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.186
Let me just find out what it's all about.

31:52.186 --> 31:54.388
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! You're the best!

31:54.388 --> 31:55.823
You're welcome.

31:55.823 --> 31:59.493
(Door opens and closes)

32:05.499 --> 32:06.667
Good night.

32:06.667 --> 32:08.269
Bye, Lila.

32:08.269 --> 32:09.303
See you tomorrow.

32:09.303 --> 32:10.471
Okay.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.708
Hey. What's up?

32:17.311 --> 32:18.846
I need to talk to you for a minute.

32:18.846 --> 32:20.581
Oh. Am I in trouble?

32:20.581 --> 32:22.349
Did... did I leave my
dirty dishes in the sink?

32:22.349 --> 32:25.786
'Cause it's a bad habit,
I know, but it's... 

32:30.758 --> 32:32.526
Karen?

32:33.627 --> 32:35.362
What is it?

32:40.701 --> 32:43.370
I need to talk to you about the break-in.

32:43.370 --> 32:46.574
There's something you should know.

32:46.574 --> 32:48.709
I'm pretty sure the
whole thing was about me.

32:48.709 --> 32:52.146
I think someone wanted my files.

32:52.146 --> 32:55.249
And what makes you think that?

32:55.249 --> 32:56.450
I can't tell you.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.886
Y... you can't tell me?
What? I don't understand.

32:58.886 --> 33:02.890
I know it seems weird, but
you just need to trust me.

33:02.890 --> 33:05.826
It's much better for you if
you don't know everything.

33:05.826 --> 33:08.162
(Scoffs) It might be better for you,

33:08.162 --> 33:11.365
but we're partners here, Karen.

33:11.365 --> 33:15.169
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you lately,

33:15.169 --> 33:17.771
but everything you do affects us.

33:17.771 --> 33:19.273
I know that, and I'm sorry.

33:19.273 --> 33:21.308
You're messing with my livelihood.

33:21.308 --> 33:23.711
I lost a patient this morning

33:23.711 --> 33:26.847
because he came in and
saw police everywhere.

33:26.847 --> 33:28.649
So if this really is about you,

33:28.649 --> 33:29.817
a... and it's gonna keep affecting me,

33:29.817 --> 33:32.252
I... I need to know what the hell it's about.

33:34.798 --> 33:37.467
I'm really sorry.

33:37.467 --> 33:39.536
You're sorry?

33:39.536 --> 33:40.971
(Scoffs) You're sorry?

33:40.971 --> 33:42.506
I'm glad you're sorry.

33:56.039 --> 33:58.809
I'm just leaving and I'm late already.

33:58.809 --> 34:00.944
Harry. Harry. Please, please.

34:00.944 --> 34:02.212
Please.

34:02.212 --> 34:03.613
Stay.

34:03.613 --> 34:04.981
Just give me a minute.

34:09.820 --> 34:12.621
Uh... 

34:12.621 --> 34:15.725
I had a job interview today.

34:15.725 --> 34:17.761
And I think I'm gonna get the offer.

34:17.761 --> 34:19.563
Well, we'll see what happens, right?

34:19.563 --> 34:22.599
If I get the offer, you
want me to take it, right?

34:25.969 --> 34:28.804
(Inhales deeply and taps foot)

34:28.804 --> 34:31.608
I can't tell you what to do, Savi.

34:31.608 --> 34:33.577
If you don't want the job, don't take it.

34:33.577 --> 34:35.112
It's not up to me.

34:35.112 --> 34:37.714
It kinda is, Harry.

34:44.588 --> 34:46.690
Now you listen to me, Sav.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.592
If you're expecting me to force you

34:49.592 --> 34:52.661
to go to work at some
job that you don't want,

34:52.661 --> 34:55.665
it's just not gonna happen.

34:55.665 --> 34:57.667
I'm not gonna be the bad guy here.

34:57.667 --> 35:00.303
So what... what exactly
do you want me to say?

35:00.303 --> 35:06.643
I just want a sign that if I take this job,

35:06.643 --> 35:08.845
it means that our
marriage is back on track.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.914
I don't know what it means, Savi.

35:10.914 --> 35:13.016
I don't... how... how could
I possibly know what it means?

35:13.016 --> 35:15.685
I don't know what any of this means!

35:15.685 --> 35:19.623
I mean, I...I just found out two
days ago that you cheated on me.

35:19.623 --> 35:21.224
So I apologize if you're offended

35:21.224 --> 35:22.893
that I don't have all the answers,

35:22.893 --> 35:26.730
but I am still dealing with
the fact that you destroyed me!

35:32.302 --> 35:36.540
And more importantly, you destroyed us.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.810
I...I don't know... I don't
know if your taking a job

35:40.810 --> 35:42.279
is gonna solve all of our problems,

35:42.279 --> 35:45.248
but I...I seriously doubt it.

35:54.758 --> 35:59.062
I am clearly just trying to
keep it together right now.

35:59.062 --> 36:01.264
Is that okay?

36:04.868 --> 36:07.204
Good talk.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.936
(Knock on door) (Olivier) Yes?

36:23.936 --> 36:26.405
I'm taking off for the night
unless you need anything else.

36:26.405 --> 36:27.539
No, I'm fine.

36:27.539 --> 36:29.508
Actually, I'm about to leave as well.

36:31.209 --> 36:34.179
(Clicks tongue) Night.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.582
(Door closes)

36:36.582 --> 36:38.150
(Speaks indistinctly)

36:57.469 --> 37:00.172
(Laughs)

37:00.952 --> 37:05.189
So I will give you one
check for all the money.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.758
I can't get it to you right now,

37:06.758 --> 37:08.893
but I should be able to in a few weeks.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.796
What happened to not
having anything available?

37:11.796 --> 37:13.698
It's really none of your business,

37:13.698 --> 37:15.400
but I am selling a piece of the store

37:15.400 --> 37:17.435
back to its original investor.

37:17.435 --> 37:20.071
After I'd finally paid him off.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.374
Well, thank you.

37:23.374 --> 37:25.042
Don't thank me.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.878
If you didn't have a child,

37:26.878 --> 37:29.180
I would've sent you away a long time ago.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.982
But Scottie's an innocent.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.717
He doesn't deserve to be punished

37:32.717 --> 37:34.051
for your and Paul's bad behavior.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.721
So this isn't me doing something for you.

37:36.721 --> 37:39.891
It's Paul doing something for his son.

38:19.864 --> 38:22.767
(Clatter, dog barking in distance)

38:43.344 --> 38:45.779
Oh, my God.

38:45.779 --> 38:47.715
Longest day ever.

38:47.715 --> 38:51.118
My boss chewed me out
over the stupidest thing.

38:52.753 --> 38:54.188
What?

38:56.123 --> 38:58.359
Uh... 

38:58.359 --> 39:00.127
I know that you know, sweetie.

39:00.127 --> 39:01.729
You know that I know?

39:01.729 --> 39:04.198
(Gasps) You know that I know?

39:04.198 --> 39:06.634
How do you know that I... oh!

39:06.634 --> 39:08.769
You know that you know
because April told you.

39:08.769 --> 39:10.537
I told her not to say anything.

39:10.537 --> 39:12.773
April already knew I was pregnant.

39:14.341 --> 39:15.509
She knew?

39:15.509 --> 39:16.710
And Karen knows, too.

39:18.479 --> 39:21.048
Oh. Well... 

39:22.650 --> 39:24.618
uh, that kinda sucks.

39:24.618 --> 39:26.086
There's more.

39:26.086 --> 39:27.755
There's more?

39:27.755 --> 39:29.356
I cheated on Harry,

39:29.356 --> 39:31.292
so he may or may not be the father,

39:31.292 --> 39:34.656
which means we may or
may not be splitting up.

39:34.656 --> 39:36.725
I don't know what's going on.

39:36.725 --> 39:39.294
It's all just a big mess.

39:43.698 --> 39:46.101
Why didn't you tell me any of this, Savi?

39:46.101 --> 39:47.803
I don't know.

39:50.705 --> 39:52.874
(Scoffs)

39:54.543 --> 39:56.978
Okay, you know what? I... I do know.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.714
But I really don't think
it matters right now.

39:59.714 --> 40:01.116
It matters to me.

40:01.116 --> 40:02.951
Fine.

40:02.951 --> 40:05.053
I didn't tell you because I
knew what you were going to say

40:05.053 --> 40:06.822
and I didn't want to hear it.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.957
What exactly did you think I was gonna say?

40:08.957 --> 40:11.593
You would've let me off the hook.

40:11.593 --> 40:13.628
You would've given me
some philosophical crap

40:13.628 --> 40:17.599
about human beings not
being built to be monogamous

40:17.599 --> 40:19.167
and not to beat myself up over it.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.771
No. For the record, I
wouldn't have said any of that.

40:22.771 --> 40:24.940
But you're right that I
wouldn't have judged you.

40:24.940 --> 40:26.641
That's just it.

40:26.641 --> 40:27.909
I want to be judged.

40:27.909 --> 40:31.613
I... I deserve to be judged for this.

40:31.613 --> 40:33.982
(Laughs)

40:33.982 --> 40:35.083
Oh.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.285
What's so funny?

40:37.285 --> 40:38.854
You didn't tell me because you thought

40:38.854 --> 40:40.322
that I was gonna be too easy on you?

40:40.322 --> 40:42.190
My ass, Savi.

40:42.190 --> 40:45.594
You didn't tell me because
God forbid I find out

40:45.594 --> 40:47.195
that my big sister wasn't perfect.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.064
What would happen if I discovered

40:49.064 --> 40:51.967
that you were an actual
human being with flaws?

40:51.967 --> 40:53.268
The universe might explode.

40:53.268 --> 40:55.604
I'm sorry. How are you
making this about you?

40:55.604 --> 40:57.105
No. No. No.

40:57.105 --> 40:59.574
This is not about me. This is about us.

40:59.574 --> 41:01.676
Okay, you're the saint. I'm the screw-up.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.678
And even when you screw up,

41:03.678 --> 41:05.614
somehow I handled everything wrong.

41:05.614 --> 41:09.251
I'm very sorry that I'm
trying to be a good example,

41:09.251 --> 41:12.120
- but I'm your big sister.
- I don't need you to teach me how to be a good person.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.023
Yes. You do.

41:15.023 --> 41:16.625
I made a mistake,

41:16.625 --> 41:19.127
but it was one time.

41:19.127 --> 41:22.197
You do this kind of thing all the time.

41:22.197 --> 41:24.332
- Oh.
- And I just did not want you to think...

41:24.332 --> 41:26.067
What? What? What?

41:26.067 --> 41:27.936
You didn't want me to
think that we were the same?

41:27.936 --> 41:31.172
Oh, no, no. We're not the same.

41:31.172 --> 41:34.075
I'm nothing like you.

41:38.013 --> 41:40.148
(Clicks tongue) You know what, Savi?

41:40.148 --> 41:42.584
Maybe you're right.

41:42.584 --> 41:44.586
Maybe I don't always think
about everyone's feelings

41:44.586 --> 41:46.655
as much as I should.

41:46.655 --> 41:49.224
But you're my sister,

41:49.224 --> 41:52.127
and I would never hurt you.

41:52.127 --> 41:53.194
Never.

41:53.194 --> 41:57.194
I would never do what you just did to me.

41:57.866 --> 42:00.802
(Voice breaks) I would
never do that to you.

42:09.244 --> 42:11.079
