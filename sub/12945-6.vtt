Oh, whatever. You are not the one
who was left stranded there.

00:05.667 --> 00:09.400
Oh, you're one to talk.
You didn't even consider my feelings.

talk about this anymore.

In fact, I don't wanna
talk to you guys at all.

Sounds great. Count me in
on the whole not-talking thing.

One little mistake,
and suddenly we're not talking.

the source of the quote, right?

but you've come prepared.
I like that in my students.

00:47.066 --> 00:49.233
Prepared? Is there, like,
a test or something?

00:49.300 --> 00:51.133
There's no test.
I would have remembered.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.133
Funny. Sounds like Gordo,
but we're not talking.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.600
Exactly what I was thinking.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.266
There better not be a test today.

It'll be like a scavenger hunt.

will lead you to the next question,

Now, I'm gonna let you

01:48.633 --> 01:49.834
Now remember, this is still a test.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.433
So who you pick will turn out
to be quite important.

Finally, I get to pick my partner.
