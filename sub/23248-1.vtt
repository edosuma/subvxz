I found it.
I finally found it.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

03:16.507 --> 03:19.970
See? Told you
she'd be here, sir.

03:19.972 --> 03:23.035
I kept my part
of the agreement.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.838
Well, a deal is a deal.

03:28.707 --> 03:30.138
Oh? Wow!

Enjoy it.

03:41.707 --> 03:44.339
Whoa. What...
What are you do...

03:44.341 --> 03:46.638
Hey, what are you doing,
fellows? Let go of me!

No, no, no! No!

(YAWNS)

04:22.010 --> 04:23.773
Back to business.

04:23.775 --> 04:27.807
"Herodotus was considered
the father of history." Cool.

Super cookie.

04:28.943 --> 04:31.008
Wow, this guy was the bomb.

04:31.010 --> 04:34.041
Hey, you're really
hitting those books hard.

04:34.043 --> 04:37.940
Tell me about it. First year of
archaeology is super demanding.

04:37.942 --> 04:42.110
I don't get what you find so
interesting about this old stuff.

04:43.876 --> 04:44.841
Oh. Now I get it.

04:44.843 --> 04:46.406
Now that is something
worth studying.

04:46.408 --> 04:47.875
She's hot.

04:47.877 --> 04:49.810
Hey, don't talk like that
about Sara.

04:49.812 --> 04:52.475
Don't start again. Nobody
buys that you know her.

04:52.477 --> 04:54.376
Actually, we even kissed.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.941
Okay, just once.

04:55.943 --> 04:56.842
Ugh. Here we go.

04:56.844 --> 04:59.143
Then we barely saw each other
after that.

04:59.145 --> 05:04.244
You know, she's been going away on long
expeditions, and I've been studying and working.

05:04.246 --> 05:06.442
Um, kind of left things
in the air.

05:06.444 --> 05:09.074
Oh, sure.
You kissed this girl?

05:09.076 --> 05:13.841
But even long distance, I feel
her here, close to my heart.

05:13.843 --> 05:16.043
- I can sense the trembling.

Yeah. And I just got a call
from Scarlett Johansson.

05:23.712 --> 05:25.110
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry.

05:25.112 --> 05:28.309
Tad, you should try living
in reality for a change.

05:28.311 --> 05:30.476
(STAMMERING) Sara?

05:30.478 --> 05:33.310
Tad. I hope I'm not
interrupting.

to the exhibition?

05:43.614 --> 05:45.612
Yeah! I can't wait
to be there!

Wonderful. I can't wait

No, no, I didn't mean you.

06:09.379 --> 06:11.846
- My bad!
- Tad, do you want me to hang up?

06:11.848 --> 06:12.714
Stop right there!

06:12.716 --> 06:14.215
Okay, so I won't hang up.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.480
Yeah. So, Luxorious Hotel?

06:22.482 --> 06:25.980
Yes. First, take the I-290 west
for 30 miles...

06:25.982 --> 06:27.746
I-290 west for 30 miles!

06:27.748 --> 06:30.779

out of your league.

punching above your weight.

is called the Red Temple of Baal.

See you!

Great. Now what?

He says we have

Come on, guys. We didn't get

I have no choice.

Please.

Give me the notebook,

TIFFANY: You have no right!

44:57.201 --> 45:01.600
We didn't do all that work just
to have you steal the piece.

45:01.602 --> 45:05.635
That's what happens when you
play against Jack Rackham.

45:13.271 --> 45:14.602
Useless mutt!

Hey, buddy.
Glad to see you.

45:30.803 --> 45:33.001
Jeff, what happened to you?

45:33.003 --> 45:36.937
We need to move fast before Rackham
finds the other pieces of the collar.

45:36.939 --> 45:38.769
I wouldn't worry about that.

45:38.771 --> 45:40.802
Tad, what are you
talking about?

45:40.804 --> 45:41.967
He wanted the notebook,

45:41.969 --> 45:44.601
but never said anything
of it being complete.

45:45.471 --> 45:46.802
Well done, Tad!

45:46.804 --> 45:49.936
Uh? (NERVOUS LAUGH) Yeah? Well, no,
I think... So, where do we go?

45:49.938 --> 45:53.535
To Cappadocia, in Turkey. There
are hundreds of temples there.

45:53.537 --> 45:57.336
Rackham won't be able to find the
right one without these pages.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.903
That would give us
a head start.

the third temple?

I don't know much about it.

appears in everything related to Midas.

some sort of personal mark.

Let's see who finds the temple first.
Boys versus girls.

52:58.527 --> 53:00.826
Let's go, Tiffany.

53:00.828 --> 53:02.823
Oh. Thank goodness
I stepped in.

53:02.825 --> 53:06.591
What's going on here? I was trying
to spend some time with Sara.

53:06.593 --> 53:09.526
Haven't you noticed something
different about her?

53:09.528 --> 53:12.158
Well, she has been acting
kind of distant.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.992
Of course!
How would she not?

53:13.994 --> 53:16.424
You're not being the knight
in shining armor she needs.

53:16.426 --> 53:17.724
The what?

53:17.726 --> 53:20.625
But fear not. We'll make
Sara melt for your bones.

53:20.627 --> 53:24.094
They don't call me the Great
Conquistador of Peru for nothing.

53:24.096 --> 53:26.226
You just need some practice.

53:26.228 --> 53:27.825
I can't believe it.

53:27.827 --> 53:31.526
If we find the second piece, we'll
be just one step away from Midas.

53:31.528 --> 53:33.394
Tiffany, there are too many
signs telling

53:33.396 --> 53:36.694
Midas' power is not something
to mess with.

53:36.696 --> 53:39.492
Are you saying we shouldn't
search for the collar?

53:39.494 --> 53:43.626
I'm just saying that maybe the
collar shouldn't see the daylight.

53:43.628 --> 53:45.092
Mmm.

53:45.094 --> 53:46.193
Ah!

53:46.195 --> 53:48.293
Hi, gorgeous.

53:48.295 --> 53:49.927
Mummy, this isn't
going to work.

53:49.929 --> 53:52.892
Mummy? Who's Mummy?
I'm Sara Lavrof.

53:52.894 --> 53:54.794
No, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

53:54.796 --> 53:57.493
Come on. Do you love Sara
or not?

53:57.495 --> 53:58.794
With all my heart.

53:58.796 --> 54:01.762
But then aren't you willing
to do whatever it takes?

54:02.430 --> 54:03.728
(SIGHS)

54:06.094 --> 54:07.695
Sara, I...

54:07.697 --> 54:08.561
Yes?

54:08.563 --> 54:10.030
I know you have
a lot on your mind.

54:10.032 --> 54:11.228
Yes?

54:11.230 --> 54:14.296
And you almost have no time
to think about the present,

54:14.298 --> 54:16.127
which is where I am.

54:16.129 --> 54:17.361
Mmm.

54:17.363 --> 54:18.495
(SIGHS)

54:18.497 --> 54:22.696
But what I truly want
is to live

54:22.698 --> 54:24.395
in the same age as you,

54:24.397 --> 54:28.496
no matter which one, you know,
past, present or future. I...

54:30.130 --> 54:31.762
I want to be your partner

54:32.499 --> 54:36.032
in the big adventure
of life.

54:39.263 --> 54:40.795
Mmm!

54:40.797 --> 54:42.364
Hey! Whoa!
What are you doing?

54:42.366 --> 54:44.663
Oh, sorry. But that was
just so beautiful.

54:44.665 --> 54:46.797
You have to tell Sara
all that stuff.

54:46.799 --> 54:50.397
She's gonna love it. Any woman
will fall in love with you now.

54:50.399 --> 54:51.930
- (GRUNTS)
- Tad!

54:54.666 --> 54:56.995
There are no symbols
from the notebook here either.

54:56.997 --> 54:59.430
It's impossible. We've
looked at over 20 temples.

54:59.432 --> 55:03.498
We'd better find the right one
before total pro Tad does.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.032
You? A total pro?

55:05.034 --> 55:08.264
If it doesn't work out with Sara,
you've got Crazy Eyes down there.

55:08.266 --> 55:12.165
Shh. Look at that.
This is the temple.

55:12.167 --> 55:13.699
Let's get back to Rackham.

55:13.701 --> 55:16.131
Maybe the others
had more luck.

55:19.334 --> 55:23.635
Stay here with Jeff. Holler if
you see those guys coming back.

looking for you.

58:00.776 --> 58:02.938
The second piece!

58:02.940 --> 58:05.807
I... I got it, Sara.
I got it.

58:05.809 --> 58:07.108
And not just that.

58:07.509 --> 58:08.740
Look.

58:09.543 --> 58:11.340
SARA: That mountain.

58:11.342 --> 58:13.008
Midas' symbol!

58:13.010 --> 58:17.241
Midas didn't make the last
offering in an existing temple.

58:17.243 --> 58:19.074
He built one for Apollo.

58:19.076 --> 58:20.940
The third piece
has got to be there!

58:20.942 --> 58:24.209
Yes. We have to hurry
and get it before Rackham.

58:26.444 --> 58:28.075
Or we can destroy this one.

58:28.677 --> 58:30.173
Destroy it?

58:30.175 --> 58:33.043
The biggest discovery in history?
You can't be serious.

58:33.045 --> 58:36.541
Tiffany, we can't let Rackham
get the power of Midas.

58:36.543 --> 58:39.373
But, Sara, we're so close.

58:39.375 --> 58:42.176
Tad, let's end this now.

58:42.178 --> 58:45.409
No, Tad. Don't give it to her.
It's crazy.

58:45.411 --> 58:48.574
Sara, isn't it better
that we get all the pieces?

58:48.576 --> 58:52.443
The power of the gods does not
belong in the hands of mortals.

58:52.445 --> 58:55.979
If Rackham gets the necklace,
he'll be invincible.

58:59.445 --> 59:01.278
Wait. Where's Tiffany?

59:02.643 --> 59:04.009

I can't believe it!

59:07.578 --> 59:09.143
Sara, I'm sorry...

59:09.145 --> 59:12.344
I have to find the third piece and
destroy it before Rackham gets it.

59:12.346 --> 59:13.710
Sara, wait for me!

59:13.712 --> 59:16.210
No, Tad, I just need
to be alone.

59:23.379 --> 59:24.645
(LIVELY CHATTER)

and after all these days
of searching

59:31.346 --> 59:33.179
you've found nothing?

This is useless!

has played me!

Hmm.

01:00:00.248 --> 01:00:02.146
Where have you been?

01:00:02.148 --> 01:00:04.779
Hey, are we going back
with Sara?

01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:07.346
She's gone.

01:00:07.348 --> 01:00:09.346

01:00:09.348 --> 01:00:11.481
She's gone too.

It's official. You're a
total disaster with women.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.914
- How could I be such an idiot?
- Well, do you want my opinion?

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.481
All I had to do
was give her the piece.

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:23.381
We'd have destroyed it
and that's it, end of story.

01:00:23.383 --> 01:00:24.816

01:00:24.818 --> 01:00:28.915

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.681
and yours
is one of the worst.

01:00:30.683 --> 01:00:32.114
Please, don't start again.

01:00:32.116 --> 01:00:35.181

fail so many times.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay, I get it. I get it.

01:00:40.649 --> 01:00:45.050

cross the whole world for love.

01:00:52.018 --> 01:00:53.348

this, but you're right.
