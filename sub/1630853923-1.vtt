Alright, let's back up
for a second here.

01:02.567 --> 01:05.238
I need to first explain

01:05.669 --> 01:07.669
how I ended up
in Schwäbisch Hall.

01:07.704 --> 01:10.177
So my name is Nick Alfieri.

01:10.212 --> 01:12.509
I'm from a big football family.

01:12.544 --> 01:15.281
I played college
football at Georgetown.

01:15.316 --> 01:16.843
<i>Alfieri knocked it loose.</i>

01:16.878 --> 01:19.813
After that,
I got into film school at USC,

01:19.848 --> 01:22.420
which was basically a dream
come true for me.

01:22.455 --> 01:24.686
So I moved to Los Angeles

01:24.721 --> 01:26.688
but then a few months
into that first semester,

01:26.723 --> 01:28.822
I really started to miss
playing football.

01:28.857 --> 01:30.824
And coincidentally,
around the same time,

01:30.859 --> 01:33.563
these football programs from
Europe started contacting me

01:33.598 --> 01:35.697
with opportunities
to go play over there.

01:35.732 --> 01:39.206
So I left.

01:39.241 --> 01:42.638
Final moments at the
USC School of Cinematic Arts.

01:42.673 --> 01:45.542
Now, the plan was
to go play football

01:45.577 --> 01:47.643
and at the same time
make a documentary

01:47.678 --> 01:52.747

we're the number one
sport in town,

02:05.894 --> 02:09.533

any football team in Germany.

13:45.362 --> 13:48.528
So when you decide to play
with a German quarterback,

13:48.563 --> 13:51.938
I think one of
the first things you'll get

13:51.973 --> 13:55.139
is people wondering
why you do that.

♪

13:58.639 --> 14:00.375

that the quarterback

is by far the most important
position in football.

14:03.215 --> 14:05.380
And a lot of teams,
the majority out here

14:05.415 --> 14:08.416
is just going to go get the best
import quarterback they can

14:08.451 --> 14:10.957
and play with him
and just put it on him.

that we can win with him,

we put a lot on his plate.

14:24.236 --> 14:25.972

because you think

14:26.007 --> 14:27.534
he plays better than any German.

14:27.569 --> 14:29.668

to be that little bit of doubt

14:35.049 --> 14:37.247
until he finish it off
with a championship.

14:37.282 --> 14:38.677

I mean, because

20:55.528 --> 20:57.396
a lot of them are really raw.

20:57.860 --> 20:59.563
So you--

21:00.093 --> 21:02.093
you can make something
out of them.

Uh, it used to be that,
okay, the really

21:04.570 --> 21:07.835
talented athletes would play
soccer or basketball or track.

21:07.870 --> 21:09.837

21:11.544 --> 21:13.005
in other sports
but choose to play football.

21:18.452 --> 21:20.452
The Unicorns is
successful because

21:20.487 --> 21:22.553
you know, they put
a ton of time and effort

21:22.588 --> 21:24.115
into their youth program.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.052
2010, 11, 12 when they
started win German Bowls,

21:27.087 --> 21:28.757
they're doing it with

21:28.792 --> 21:30.561
pretty much all guys
from Schwäbisch Hall.

21:30.596 --> 21:31.859
You know, we don't have

21:31.894 --> 21:33.025
three million

21:33.060 --> 21:34.598
it's 40,000

so you're only going to
have 20, 30 kids.

21:38.637 --> 21:40.406
So if you want to be good
in the future,

21:40.441 --> 21:43.376
you have to make sure those 20,
30 are well-coached

21:43.411 --> 21:44.608
and so when they eventually

21:44.643 --> 21:46.511
get to the senior team,
you know,

21:46.546 --> 21:48.447

25:00.707 --> 25:02.300
Okay? That's it.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.676
This-- This big six is over.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.877
We didn't--
We didn't shine but guys,

25:08.209 --> 25:10.143
we play hopefully till October.

25:10.178 --> 25:11.947
Yeah, that's a long time.

25:11.982 --> 25:13.916
Alright? Come on, bring it in.

25:20.793 --> 25:22.056
-Ready Uni--
-Corns!

25:22.091 --> 25:24.355
Okay!

25:24.390 --> 25:26.665
<i> The following week</i>
<i>we watched from home</i>

25:26.700 --> 25:28.700
<i>as New Yorker</i>
<i>drove down to Austria</i>

25:28.735 --> 25:31.637
<i>and dominated Swarco.</i>

25:31.672 --> 25:33.672
<i>New Yorker looked</i>
<i>stronger than ever</i>

25:33.707 --> 25:37.302
<i>and our goal of a German Bowl</i>
<i>Championship seems unlikely.</i>

25:41.077 --> 25:43.110
<i> The next game,</i>

25:43.145 --> 25:44.881
<i>I broke my collar bone.</i>

25:54.024 --> 25:55.122
Thank you.

25:55.157 --> 25:56.288
Take the elevator?

25:56.323 --> 25:58.356
Yeah, elevator. No stairs.

26:02.296 --> 26:05.671
Adrenaline is wearing off,
and this actually hurts so bad.

26:06.036 --> 26:08.905
That is my collarbone

26:08.940 --> 26:10.907
sticking up.

26:10.942 --> 26:13.778
And it's, uh,

26:13.813 --> 26:17.078
indications to operating
because there are more pieces.

26:17.113 --> 26:19.278
-It's dislocated, yes?
-Yeah.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.049
<i> I need surgery,</i>

26:21.084 --> 26:24.019
<i>and now I'm starting</i>
<i>to question everything.</i>

26:24.054 --> 26:26.758
<i>I figured The Unicorns</i>
<i>would send me home.</i>

26:26.793 --> 26:28.254
<i>That's what teams in Europe do</i>

26:28.289 --> 26:29.827
<i>when their American</i>
<i>imports get hurt.</i>

26:29.862 --> 26:32.896
♪

26:35.835 --> 26:37.736
Uh, I just had to get
out of the house.

26:37.771 --> 26:39.969
I can't sit around all day

26:40.169 --> 26:42.070
with this collar bone situation.

26:42.105 --> 26:44.908
I need to get out and move
around, otherwise I'll go crazy.

26:45.746 --> 26:48.076
From us,
as an organization standpoint,

26:48.111 --> 26:50.111
we're in a tough,
tough situation

26:50.146 --> 26:53.378
because that's a longer injury,
and we've got to make a decision

26:53.413 --> 26:55.347
whether we're going
to send Nick home

26:55.382 --> 26:57.217
and get somebody
over here who can play?

26:57.252 --> 27:00.385
The easy decision,
just thank him for being here.

27:00.420 --> 27:03.289
Make sure he's healthy,
and then send him home

27:03.324 --> 27:06.864
and get a guy who can finish
this season healthy

27:06.899 --> 27:08.734
and that we know
is going to be here.

27:19.241 --> 27:20.438
Okay, um,

27:21.111 --> 27:23.045
I just got off
the phone with Jordan

27:23.080 --> 27:26.015
and he told me that The Unicorns

27:26.215 --> 27:28.413
are not going to send me home,
they're going to keep me here,

27:28.448 --> 27:31.152
in Schwäbisch Hall,
which is actually amazing.

27:31.187 --> 27:33.187
I thought that they would
for sure send me home

27:33.222 --> 27:35.255
and get a new import, um,

27:36.159 --> 27:37.994
but they said, uh,
they're going to keep me here

27:38.029 --> 27:39.457
and for me to get healthy

27:39.492 --> 27:41.800
and try and get ready
for the playoffs,

27:41.835 --> 27:44.495
uh, which is
in a couple of months.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.003
<i> So I use my new time</i>
<i>away from the field</i>

27:47.038 --> 27:48.741
<i>to find out everything I could</i>

27:48.776 --> 27:50.336
<i>about the Schwäbisch Hall</i>
<i>Unicorns.</i>

27:58.016 --> 27:59.752
Talking about the mentality

27:59.787 --> 28:01.512
of Schwäbisch Hall,
I'm-- I'm obviously biased

28:01.547 --> 28:04.152
because I-- I was born
and raised here.

28:04.187 --> 28:06.253
And so there's
a lot of local pride.

28:06.288 --> 28:08.354
We're not like people from
Stuttgart who are Swabian,

28:08.389 --> 28:10.092
you know, they
always think we are

28:10.127 --> 28:12.160
because of the Schwabisch
in our name but we aren't.

28:12.195 --> 28:14.393
And we're not like the people
from Nuremberg,

28:14.428 --> 28:17.198
from Northern Bavaria
who are Franconian

28:17.233 --> 28:19.431
because we're something
in between.

28:19.466 --> 28:22.170
And that's a-- that's a little
bit of the mentality here

28:22.205 --> 28:24.975
is that we are
something special.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.210
Have you been
to the museum up there?

28:29.245 --> 28:31.014
Yeah, Schurmann
and Tobi Loffler took me.

28:31.049 --> 28:32.950
Uh, Schurmann and Tobi,
they took me.

28:32.985 --> 28:34.413
To the Hallisch Frankisches
Museum?

28:34.448 --> 28:36.855
-It's awesome.
-They actually have

28:36.890 --> 28:38.758
Christian Rothe's jersey

28:39.090 --> 28:40.419
and, uh,

28:41.092 --> 28:43.191
my game plan and

28:43.523 --> 28:45.292
-something else.
-In the museum?

28:45.327 --> 28:47.800
In the museum from
our first German Bowl win.

28:47.835 --> 28:50.132
Because the museum director
came to me and said,

28:50.167 --> 28:51.562
"Can I get some stuff?

28:51.597 --> 28:53.905
Because this is--
you wrote history."

28:55.601 --> 28:58.470
My job is, uh,
being a high school teacher.

28:58.505 --> 29:00.076
And then, uh,

29:00.111 --> 29:01.979
with a full schedule,

29:02.014 --> 29:04.982
I balance that with coaching

29:05.380 --> 29:06.951
through experience, I guess.

29:06.986 --> 29:08.887
So you maybe you
want to talk about

29:08.922 --> 29:11.285
the-- the educational
system in the USA,

29:11.320 --> 29:13.353
um, as-- as one possible topic.

29:13.388 --> 29:15.190
We have one full-time employee.

29:15.225 --> 29:17.357
That's my office coordinator,
Jordan Newman.

29:17.392 --> 29:18.897
We don't even
have any part time,

29:18.932 --> 29:20.492
so everybody else is volunteer.

29:20.527 --> 29:23.836
Well, if I compare that--
The Unicorn situation to

29:23.871 --> 29:25.266
teams like Frankfurt
and Braunschweig,

29:25.301 --> 29:27.466
they have quite a few
full-time employees,

29:27.501 --> 29:29.270
several full-time coaches

29:29.503 --> 29:31.536
and then also, uh,
front office people

29:31.571 --> 29:33.373
that are-- that work full time

29:33.408 --> 29:37.047
and yeah, so we're at--
at a disadvantage there that,

29:37.082 --> 29:39.412
you know, we have to make up
for it by other means.

29:39.447 --> 29:41.546
We don't pay
our German players.

29:41.581 --> 29:43.581
And I've got to go out

29:43.616 --> 29:46.518
and recruit some of the best
German talent around.

29:46.553 --> 29:49.290
Yet compete with other teams
who are telling them,

29:49.325 --> 29:51.963
"I'll give you this amount
of money to come here."

29:51.998 --> 29:53.525
And I've got to sell to them,

29:53.560 --> 29:56.231
"Come here despite
not making the money."

29:56.266 --> 29:59.432
Yeah, I had, uh,
a good offer from, uh,

29:59.467 --> 30:01.368
Frankfurt before the season.

30:01.403 --> 30:03.942
I was thinking about
it for a long time.

30:03.977 --> 30:05.570
I'm not sure if we can--

30:05.605 --> 30:09.013
we can keep it forever
or for-- for very long because,

30:09.048 --> 30:10.542
I mean, into that, uh, teams

30:10.577 --> 30:13.215
who do pay the majority
of their players

30:13.250 --> 30:15.349
and eventually,
you know, that's a--

30:15.384 --> 30:17.516
that's a recruiting
factor that--

30:17.551 --> 30:19.452
that's gotta be hard.

30:19.487 --> 30:21.124
<i> Learning that</i>
<i>these German guys</i>

30:21.159 --> 30:23.093
<i>are playing for</i>
<i>The Unicorns for free,</i>

30:23.128 --> 30:24.930
<i>when a lot of them could go</i>
<i>make money at other teams</i>

30:24.965 --> 30:27.064
<i>was really eye opening for me.</i>

30:28.331 --> 30:30.397
You know, like,
it's really hard to

30:31.301 --> 30:33.301
stay up early, go to work,

30:33.336 --> 30:36.205
go back from work,
go straight to youth practice,

30:36.240 --> 30:39.604
after youth practice
at senior practice.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.915
And then like Laura,
my girlfriend, say, "Hey,

30:43.478 --> 30:45.313
do you-- do you remember me?"

30:49.715 --> 30:52.386
<i> So I got my surgery</i>

30:52.421 --> 30:53.618
<i>and I returned to practice.</i>

30:53.653 --> 30:55.257
Well played. Well played.

30:58.031 --> 30:59.932
So be shallow, curl,

30:59.967 --> 31:01.263
and a shoot
coming out like this.

31:01.298 --> 31:02.429
So you got that nice triangle.

31:07.172 --> 31:09.073
<i> After being around</i>
<i>the team less as a player</i>

31:09.108 --> 31:11.306
<i>and more someone</i>
<i>with an outside perspective,</i>

31:11.341 --> 31:13.638
<i>I started to notice some things.</i>

31:13.673 --> 31:16.344
<i>Football with The Unicorns</i>
<i>was different.</i>

31:16.379 --> 31:17.444

36:11.509 --> 36:13.344
-Well, after this game, well--
-I think that's--

36:13.379 --> 36:15.808
-Yeah.
-It just takes time.

36:16.415 --> 36:20.318
Uh, just back from
the doctor again,

36:20.353 --> 36:23.750
and we play--
we will probably play Frankfurt

36:23.950 --> 36:25.521
in the GFL South title game.

36:25.556 --> 36:27.919
And they are not sure

36:27.954 --> 36:30.889
if I will be ready
for that or not.

36:33.630 --> 36:35.564
<i> In the GFL,</i>
<i>there's a natural pressure</i>

36:35.599 --> 36:37.929
<i>on American imports to perform.</i>

36:37.964 --> 36:40.734
<i>Now being injured and not being</i>
<i>able to contribute to the team,</i>

36:40.769 --> 36:43.407
<i>especially when you're</i>
<i>one of the only paid players,</i>

36:43.442 --> 36:45.376
<i>is an uncomfortable situation.</i>

36:47.413 --> 36:49.842
<i>But The Unicorns</i>
<i>never made me feel bad.</i>

36:49.877 --> 36:51.316
Did you load yet?

36:51.351 --> 36:52.911
-Hello, Nick.
-Hey.

36:52.946 --> 36:55.353
-How's it going?
-What did the doctor say?

36:55.388 --> 36:57.487
Uh, still a bit longer.

36:57.522 --> 36:59.016
-Probably
-And you need to stop moving it?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.655
Yeah, I got to
stop moving it.

37:00.690 --> 37:02.294
-Hi guys.

37:03.759 --> 37:05.561
Come on.

37:05.596 --> 37:07.794
Moritz, you better
get out here for practice.

37:07.829 --> 37:09.862
<i> And one of the cool</i>
<i>things I learned</i>

37:09.897 --> 37:13.305
<i>is that Sigi won't ever turn</i>
<i>anyone away from The Unicorns.</i>

37:13.340 --> 37:15.604
Hey, let me introduce you,
this is Daniel.

37:15.639 --> 37:17.034
-From Spain.
-Hello.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.904
-He's going to play for us.
-Hola, senor.

37:18.939 --> 37:21.511
<i>They want to be on the team,</i>
<i>he'll let them join.</i>

37:21.546 --> 37:22.875
Madrid.

37:22.910 --> 37:24.910
Buck up.

37:26.584 --> 37:27.913
Go Madrid!

37:30.016 --> 37:32.357
-Unicorn in Spanish?
-Unicornio.

37:32.392 --> 37:33.952
-Unicornio.
-Unicornio.

37:33.987 --> 37:35.525
That's my Unicornio.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.395
Unicornio on three.

37:40.664 --> 37:42.862
Because it's a big family, so--

37:42.897 --> 37:45.337
And everybody takes
care of everybody.

37:45.372 --> 37:47.768
So I never, ever want to
play for, uh, other team

37:47.803 --> 37:49.902
only the U.

37:56.383 --> 37:57.778
Yeah, isn't it weird?

37:57.813 --> 38:00.418
This is the first summer
that I haven't been home.

38:02.389 --> 38:04.114
Yeah, it's still kind of broken.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.951
I mean,
it feels better, but I'm not--

38:05.986 --> 38:07.656
I'm not clear to play yet.

38:07.691 --> 38:09.493
But actually,
we're going on a trip right now.

38:09.528 --> 38:11.660
Uh, like, in five minutes,
I have the doctor's appointment.

38:11.695 --> 38:13.431
-When we get back. Yeah.
-<i> Really?</i>

38:14.434 --> 38:16.599
Prague, Czech Republic.

38:18.064 --> 38:19.536
I know, isn't that cool?

38:19.571 --> 38:21.373
-Hey, Nick?
-Yeah.

38:21.408 --> 38:23.870
-Are you ready?
-Hey, I'm almost ready.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.872
Alright, I've to go.

38:25.907 --> 38:27.478
About to leave.

38:27.876 --> 38:30.448
Tell everybody
I say hi, alright?

38:30.813 --> 38:31.845
Okay.

38:32.683 --> 38:34.980

What do you guys wanna do?

39:28.233 --> 39:30.541
-I'm gonna see the waterfall.
-Oh, yeah?

39:30.576 --> 39:32.103
-Should we walk to it?
-Yeah.

39:32.545 --> 39:34.171
Let's do it. You wanna walk
down to the waterfall?

39:34.206 --> 39:36.074
If Rudy runs don't run, alright?

39:36.109 --> 39:38.549
-know.
-I can't even see.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.519
-We toasted that thing.
-Yeah, we did toast him.

39:42.522 --> 39:44.852
And. Yeah, yeah.

39:46.691 --> 39:49.593
The well-being
of the players is always

39:49.991 --> 39:52.530
number one on my agenda.

39:52.565 --> 39:54.191
I don't want to see
it as a business, you know?

39:54.226 --> 39:55.797
Where you just bring in
people and say,

39:55.832 --> 39:57.733
Hey, you know,
you guys play for us.

39:57.768 --> 39:59.636
Uh, we want to get
as much production

39:59.671 --> 40:01.066
out of you as possible,
and that's it.

40:01.101 --> 40:03.167
But I would like
for these people to-- to

40:03.202 --> 40:05.202
grow themselves
and help us grow.

40:05.644 --> 40:07.072
You know what
I'm saying? We're here to

40:07.107 --> 40:08.810
have this human experience.

40:08.845 --> 40:11.043
You can't have that
without taking risk.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.682
You can't have that without, uh,

40:12.717 --> 40:14.046
getting on a flight
and coming to Germany

40:14.081 --> 40:15.553
where you know
nobody from there,

40:15.588 --> 40:16.686
where you're,
uh, you by yourself,

40:16.721 --> 40:18.149
you leaving your parents,

40:18.184 --> 40:20.723
you leaving your whole family
back at the crib,

40:20.758 --> 40:23.528
you gonna be in a-- a place
that you never thought you'd be,

40:23.563 --> 40:25.695
meeting people that you
never thought you would meet,

40:25.730 --> 40:28.731
having relationships that
you never thought you'd have,

40:29.030 --> 40:30.634
can't shy away from it.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.108
I said years ago

40:43.143 --> 40:45.176
when Frankfurt was
probably the third league,

40:45.750 --> 40:47.849
and we said, well, you know,
we're-- we're trying

40:47.884 --> 40:49.246
to make the best
of what we have here.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.918
We don't have any outside guys,

40:50.953 --> 40:53.591
and we're trying to go
do a good junior program.

40:53.626 --> 40:57.023
But eventually the big cities
like Frankfurt, uh,

40:57.058 --> 40:59.894
and Munich and Berlin, they
should all pass us, you know,

40:59.929 --> 41:02.732
just because of
the infrastructure they have.

41:02.965 --> 41:05.163
And I mean,
you see the Frankfurt now,

41:05.198 --> 41:07.836
you know,
with relatively little ease,

41:07.871 --> 41:10.872
uh, I mean, now they have
a lot of money behind them, too.

41:10.907 --> 41:14.007
-Yeah.
-Not just-- Not just players.

41:14.042 --> 41:17.043
-You know there is.
-But it's-- it's happening.

41:17.078 --> 41:19.276
And now the question is, do we--

41:19.311 --> 41:21.751
do we try and scratch and fight

41:21.786 --> 41:24.050
with our homegrown talent and...

41:24.085 --> 41:25.590
Yeah.

41:35.899 --> 41:38.801
Okay, uh, just
got out of the doctor

41:38.836 --> 41:42.002
and, uh, I'm cleared to play
this weekend.

41:42.037 --> 41:44.334
Collar bone is
good enough to go.

41:44.369 --> 41:47.645
And we play Frankfurt
for the South title.

41:48.813 --> 41:50.109
Wow, let's go.

41:55.688 --> 41:57.952
<i>The Frankfurt rematch was big.</i>

41:57.987 --> 42:00.955
<i>Winner of this game would have</i>
<i>top playoff seed in the South.</i>

42:00.990 --> 42:04.189
<i>And the best path to play</i>
<i>New Yorker in the German Bowl.</i>

42:06.259 --> 42:09.832
♪

42:13.739 --> 42:15.002
You know, we felt confident.

42:15.037 --> 42:16.806
We-- We had
finally found our groove.

42:16.841 --> 42:19.237
We're rolling
and we knew they were too.

42:19.272 --> 42:21.679
Uh, so it was just
one of those weekends

42:21.714 --> 42:23.274
that, you know, you've just
been waiting for all year.

42:38.797 --> 42:40.357
Scored the first two touchdowns

42:40.392 --> 42:42.898
when we had a 14-zero lead,
we stunned their crowd.

42:42.933 --> 42:44.735
I know one thing though
their first touchdown

42:44.770 --> 42:46.198
that they had,

42:46.233 --> 42:48.673
that house was on fire.

42:48.708 --> 42:50.004
I mean, that stadium was burnt.

42:57.046 --> 42:59.211
I mean, it was what
everybody was expecting.

42:59.246 --> 43:02.148
I mean, it was two
dynamic explosive offenses.

43:02.183 --> 43:04.381
You know, played the punches
then in the second half,

43:04.416 --> 43:06.284
it kind of turned
into a defensive game.

43:06.759 --> 43:08.154
Yeah, I go strong ahead?

43:34.985 --> 43:37.051
<i> When I first came</i>
<i>to Germany, I did not know</i>

43:37.086 --> 43:38.283
<i>what I was getting myself into.</i>

43:38.318 --> 43:39.889
He's so improved, everybody.

43:39.924 --> 43:42.760
So we can improve
at all levels of the game.

43:42.795 --> 43:44.828
Alright? So great job.

43:44.863 --> 43:47.699
Celebrate like hell
till Wednesday.

43:47.734 --> 43:49.459
<i> I thought maybe I'd get</i>
<i>to go over and enjoy</i>

43:49.494 --> 43:52.803
<i>one last season of football</i>
<i>before I hung it all up.</i>

43:52.838 --> 43:54.937
<i>But fate had</i>
<i>a different plan for me,</i>

43:54.972 --> 43:56.939
<i>and at first glance,</i>
<i>breaking my collar bone,</i>

43:56.974 --> 44:00.437
<i>three games into the season</i>
<i>was absolutely devastating.</i>

44:00.472 --> 44:02.373
<i>But what it gave me</i>
<i>was the opportunity to gain</i>

44:02.408 --> 44:04.111
<i>a new perspective on this team.</i>

44:09.217 --> 44:10.788
<i> I spent three months</i>
<i>learning everything</i>

44:10.823 --> 44:12.284
<i>I could about the Unicorns,</i>

44:12.319 --> 44:14.121
<i>interviewing my teammates</i>
<i>and coaches</i>

44:14.156 --> 44:15.925
<i>and people around</i>
<i>Schwäbisch Hall.</i>

44:15.960 --> 44:18.356
<i>And in that process,</i>
<i>my teammates became my brothers,</i>

44:18.391 --> 44:20.226
<i>my coaches became my mentors,</i>

44:20.261 --> 44:21.964
<i>and I fell in love</i>
<i>with the town.</i>

44:21.999 --> 44:23.834
-Nick.
-Cody.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.737
I'm going to have to move,
I'm standing here for an hour.

44:25.772 --> 44:27.431
We try the first couple one

44:27.466 --> 44:29.367
-and then you give me a...
-We'll try, if you do a bad job

44:29.402 --> 44:30.973
I'm going.

44:31.008 --> 44:32.942
-See you.
-See you.

44:32.977 --> 44:35.879
<i> And it turns out the Ami</i>
<i>House was kind of awesome.</i>

44:35.914 --> 44:38.310
Cody's mad that I cooked
and it got really smoky.

44:38.345 --> 44:40.081
We had to take all
the smoke detectors

44:40.116 --> 44:41.753
out of the house
because of Nick.

44:41.788 --> 44:43.183
<i>The Unicorns kept me around</i>

44:43.218 --> 44:44.349
<i>when they could</i>
<i>have easily swapped me</i>

44:44.384 --> 44:46.120
<i>for a healthy new import,</i>

44:46.155 --> 44:48.056
<i>and they treated me</i>
<i>well when I was down.</i>

44:48.091 --> 44:50.993
<i>And that really gave me a sense</i>
<i>of love towards the program.</i>

45:01.874 --> 45:04.303
<i> Now this team</i>
<i>shouldn't be successful,</i>

45:04.338 --> 45:07.779
<i>yet somehow</i>
<i>it finds a way to be.</i>

45:07.814 --> 45:10.980
<i>But ultimately,</i>
<i>we're facing Goliath.</i>

45:13.413 --> 45:15.116
<i>And now we were</i>
<i>two playoff wins away</i>

45:15.151 --> 45:17.316

♪

45:53.519 --> 45:55.420
From that, our

45:55.994 --> 45:58.027
D-line is much improved.

46:01.197 --> 46:02.867
-like, using them better.
-Yeah.

46:03.298 --> 46:06.299
And right around August,
playoff starts

46:06.334 --> 46:08.532
then all of a sudden
it's like things start clicking

46:08.567 --> 46:10.534
and you're like, "Oh, shit,

46:11.075 --> 46:12.404
here we come."

46:13.880 --> 46:15.473
<i> There was a whole</i>

<i>play against teams</i>
<i>from the North,</i>

46:24.385 --> 46:26.990

46:33.427 --> 46:35.526
You have challenges
that you're going to face,

46:35.561 --> 46:38.496
and you have challenges that
sometimes may seem overwhelming

46:38.531 --> 46:42.401
or may seem too big or may seem
that you might never get it.

46:42.436 --> 46:44.238
But as long as, you know,

46:44.273 --> 46:46.636
you're relentless and
you just keep coming after it

46:46.671 --> 46:48.308
and keep coming after it,

46:48.343 --> 46:50.145
eventually that payoff
is going to be there.

46:50.180 --> 46:51.443
We are all underdogs.

47:02.093 --> 47:03.455
You know,
one of the great things

47:03.490 --> 47:05.259
about this import group
is you can feel

47:05.294 --> 47:07.360
that they were out
to go win a championship.

47:07.395 --> 47:09.197
Have you ever
won a championship?

47:09.232 --> 47:10.902
-No.
-No, man.

47:10.937 --> 47:12.497
Never won a championship.
Never been a part of a team

47:12.532 --> 47:14.235

winning a championship.

won a championship?

Bowls consecutively.

of those teams

47:23.444 --> 47:25.510

more than any other.

47:25.545 --> 47:28.414

us into the playoffs.

was my ultimate goal, man.

50:05.639 --> 50:07.342

discuss the last game

like Schwäbisch Hall

52:16.506 --> 52:19.738
with only 40,000 people

52:20.675 --> 52:23.973
I can-- I mean, uh,
it's hard, it's really hard.

52:25.515 --> 52:27.746
But I go,

52:27.781 --> 52:30.815
if I have to make
the decision for that,

52:31.752 --> 52:33.488
I go for

52:33.985 --> 52:35.490
that one.

52:36.724 --> 52:41.265
2012 because
it was really special.

52:41.300 --> 52:44.796
We had a lot of--
I mean, uh, the team

52:44.996 --> 52:47.370
was really great,
the people are really great.

52:47.405 --> 52:49.405
So we stick together.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.901
Had a lot of good memories.

52:50.936 --> 52:53.442
Yeah, I mean, I go for that one.

52:54.610 --> 52:55.939
-We'll get it, alright?
-Alright.

52:55.974 --> 52:57.512
-Go.
-Nice.

52:57.547 --> 52:58.744
Good job.

52:59.450 --> 53:00.746
Another trick, though.

53:00.781 --> 53:02.253
Getting the chance
to like, go up

53:02.288 --> 53:03.386
against American players,

53:03.421 --> 53:04.915
everything in practice
is awesome.

53:04.950 --> 53:06.620
And I know they're supposed
to run through you,

53:06.655 --> 53:07.819
like, almost every time.

53:07.854 --> 53:09.623
But I think there's a point

53:09.658 --> 53:11.592
and I think that's why
we bring Americans to Europe.

53:11.627 --> 53:13.022
Like, it's not
for them to go out

53:13.057 --> 53:14.925
and raid the league,
it's for them to practice

53:14.960 --> 53:16.531
and compete against

53:16.566 --> 53:18.302
all the German
and all the European guys.

53:18.337 --> 53:21.239
So we get the chance
to like get better.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.837
When you see stuff
like this around town,

53:25.872 --> 53:27.476
-does that feel pretty good?
-Yeah.

53:28.908 --> 53:30.809
-Yeah?
-That means we've arrived.

53:31.812 --> 53:33.878
You've arrived
when you see that.

53:33.913 --> 53:36.716

33 years ago it's be like this?

53:36.751 --> 53:38.421
No.

53:38.456 --> 53:41.886
Uh, I was hoping, you know,
I've always been

53:42.493 --> 53:44.955
part of the--
the dream or the idea

53:45.958 --> 53:47.397
to

53:47.795 --> 53:49.465
you know, be

53:50.666 --> 53:52.633
part of the town culture.

53:52.668 --> 53:54.536

things I learned from Sigi is

54:14.756 --> 54:16.459

Whatever your situation is,
whether it's in football

54:18.826 --> 54:21.563

you make the most out of it.

54:21.598 --> 54:23.796
You do the absolute
very best you can.

54:23.831 --> 54:28.438
And Sigi is somebody who just
absolutely will not tolerate

54:28.473 --> 54:30.407
somebody making excuses
or basically feeling

54:30.442 --> 54:31.837
sorry for himself.

54:31.872 --> 54:33.740
Don't shy away
from the adversity,

turn it and run away...

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.301

This is two by two.

1:01:43.336 --> 1:01:44.841

1:01:44.876 --> 1:01:46.502

pinch when we have to go off.

Like, he can't throw this here.

1:01:58.549 --> 1:02:00.956

again accidentally.

1:22:32.155 --> 1:22:34.683
You know, it feels good
to-- to have built that

1:22:34.718 --> 1:22:36.322
and look back at it.

1:22:37.325 --> 1:22:39.325
This will always be Sigi's team.

1:22:39.558 --> 1:22:43.296
It will always be
Sigi Gehrke's Unicorns.

1:22:43.331 --> 1:22:45.562
Proud of you guys.
I love you all.

1:22:45.795 --> 1:22:47.465
Yeah, love you too, Sigi.

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.566
No, I-- I love you all.

1:22:49.601 --> 1:22:53.537
I see myself as
the next head coach, but,

1:22:53.572 --> 1:22:56.573
you know, not necessarily
a replacement for him.

1:22:56.608 --> 1:22:59.378
But one thing
I'll always try and do is

1:22:59.413 --> 1:23:03.316
keep the direction
and the culture that he set here

1:23:03.747 --> 1:23:05.384
because it's a culture
of success

1:23:05.419 --> 1:23:09.322
and it's a culture of
really caring for people.

1:23:09.357 --> 1:23:11.753
Siegfried Sigi Gehrke,

1:23:12.525 --> 1:23:14.261
he's Mr. Unicorn.

1:23:14.296 --> 1:23:17.198
Sigi is Unicorns, I mean,

1:23:18.795 --> 1:23:22.665
I don't know like, Sigi
never quit for the Unicorns.

1:23:22.700 --> 1:23:26.570
I put your wheelchair on
the field and go back and forth.

1:23:26.605 --> 1:23:28.539
You know, I'll give
everything I have,

1:23:28.574 --> 1:23:30.673
every amount of energy I have

1:23:30.708 --> 1:23:33.808
um, to this program
and to continue,

1:23:33.843 --> 1:23:36.481
uh, building on what,
uh, Sigi has done

1:23:36.516 --> 1:23:39.319
and, um, you know,
take the-- the team

1:23:39.354 --> 1:23:41.222
and to almost,

1:23:41.257 --> 1:23:43.257
you could probably say,
the next generation of things.

1:23:55.337 --> 1:23:58.338
