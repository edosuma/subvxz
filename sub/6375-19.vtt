WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:03.050
Ok I need to say something

00:03.050 --> 00:05.333
And this is really hard

00:06.176 --> 00:07.640
You know in situations like these

00:07.640 --> 00:12.817
It's best to just take a deep breath and say it

00:13.939 --> 00:17.002
Grimaldi's pizza's slightly superior than Lombardi's, you win

00:17.002 --> 00:20.223
Never challenge me when it comes to pizza cause you will always lose

00:20.614 --> 00:22.131
My dollar please

00:26.425 --> 00:27.362
What's this?

00:27.362 --> 00:28.893
Open it and see

00:32.392 --> 00:33.326
It's a hair put

00:34.294 --> 00:35.077
Matt ..

00:35.077 --> 00:37.547
Saw it and I thought of you, Bee for Betty

00:38.446 --> 00:39.683
The stones aren't real or anything

00:39.683 --> 00:41.585
I mean they're real, they're just not .. You know ..

00:41.585 --> 00:43.587
It's beautiful, I love it

00:44.358 --> 00:47.106
I wanted to get you something in honor of our monthiversary

00:47.462 --> 00:48.702
Has it been a month already?

00:49.399 --> 00:51.495
You know, you don't always have to bring me back to Queens

00:51.895 --> 00:53.603
Well that's where my queen lives

00:55.579 --> 00:56.510
Dad!

00:56.510 --> 00:59.121

 Nazelway@hotmail.com

00:59.956 --> 01:00.736
I'm so sorry

01:00.782 --> 01:03.928
I didn't realize you two were out here

01:04.860 --> 01:05.427
Hi Matt

01:05.427 --> 01:06.571
Hello Mr. Suarez

01:06.865 --> 01:10.504
I was on my to the Bianco's see if I could borrow their cooler to go on this trip

01:10.504 --> 01:12.018
I made them sugar cookies

01:12.018 --> 01:12.739
On what trip?

01:12.739 --> 01:16.503
My dad is taking Justin to a cabin in the Poconos with Elena and her nephews

01:16.503 --> 01:17.697
Oh that should be cool

01:17.697 --> 01:19.041
Yeah cool

01:21.777 --> 01:25.244
Oh ok, I'll see you kids later

01:28.400 --> 01:30.539
- Sorry 
- That's okay

01:31.715 --> 01:33.658
You don't have to walk me all the way in

01:33.658 --> 01:36.705
What can I say .. I'm a nice guy

01:37.529 --> 01:38.689
Hey I had fun tonight

01:38.689 --> 01:39.924
Oh me too

01:44.889 --> 01:46.585
Thank you, thanks for dinner!

01:46.832 --> 01:48.437
It was delicious

01:51.530 --> 01:52.512
Papi!

01:52.512 --> 01:55.202
Oh no! I'm so sorry

01:56.189 --> 01:57.221
It's okay, I have a hard head

01:57.221 --> 01:58.300
How are you doing Mr. Suarez?

01:58.300 --> 02:00.820
Good, good, how are you councilman?

02:00.820 --> 02:01.724
I'm good

02:01.724 --> 02:03.520
Good .. Good!

02:04.762 --> 02:06.122
Well I guess I should be getting home

02:06.122 --> 02:07.011
I'll see you tomorrow

02:07.011 --> 02:08.495
Oh ok, oh ok

02:08.495 --> 02:09.088
Goodnight

02:09.088 --> 02:10.000
Bye

02:10.000 --> 02:11.830
Bye! For now

02:13.812 --> 02:16.408
So another date huh?

02:16.408 --> 02:18.203
Things are going good between you guys

02:18.658 --> 02:19.674
I guess

02:19.674 --> 02:21.406
Hilda, how was your date?

02:22.103 --> 02:24.525
You guess? Why aren't you more enthusiastic?

02:24.525 --> 02:26.309
Archie is a great guy

02:26.309 --> 02:28.529
I know papi okay?

02:29.086 --> 02:32.978
I like him, I'm just not sure if I LIKE him yet

02:32.978 --> 02:37.260
Hilda, that's like saying you're not sure you like Sirloin steak, it's crazy

02:37.953 --> 02:41.768
Mum, Do I really have to go camping with grandpa and Elena?

02:42.042 --> 02:44.536
Yes! Elena's nephews are dying to meet you

02:44.536 --> 02:46.474
And they planned the whole thing with you and Mike

02:46.474 --> 02:48.637
They planned it with me and Mike to be at a spa

02:48.637 --> 02:51.311
With mud baths and ginger facials

02:51.311 --> 02:52.237
You're going

02:53.348 --> 02:54.926
There'll be plenty of mud

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.181 --> 03:24.570
Connor?

03:31.073 --> 03:32.988
Connor?

03:49.253 --> 03:53.673
Okay guys, with Mode's first ever sex issue on the stand in just 3 days

03:53.673 --> 03:55.328
It might seem like the hard work's over

03:55.328 --> 03:56.283
But it's not

03:56.758 --> 03:59.351
In order to get new advertisers and keep the old ones

03:59.842 --> 04:01.702
We have to make sure our overnight numbers kill

04:01.702 --> 04:05.468
That means using every resource we can to get people talking

04:05.468 --> 04:06.722
You know, fire them up

04:06.722 --> 04:09.327
Oh Daniel, we could do a tying with modernway.com

04:09.327 --> 04:10.053
Bring it!

04:10.053 --> 04:11.952
Great! See, that's an awesome idea

04:11.952 --> 04:14.485
I think you people know how important this issue is

04:23.433 --> 04:26.609
Pardon me, I had a late night

04:26.808 --> 04:28.418
Here's some more coffee for you

04:28.418 --> 04:30.567
You all know what to do, let's get to it

04:36.079 --> 04:38.501
Ok, you are going to laugh

04:38.501 --> 04:41.188
I just got off the phone with the Olsen's twins

04:41.188 --> 04:45.084
Apparently they feel just awful that they didn't include you

04:45.084 --> 04:48.299
In their big "influence" cokie table book

04:48.299 --> 04:52.221
So they would love it, if you would be a part of their next book

04:52.221 --> 04:53.681
"More influence"

04:55.409 --> 04:56.382
Willy

05:01.345 --> 05:03.076
Willy?

05:06.377 --> 05:12.359
Oh my god, oh my god! She's dead, She's dead!

05:12.359 --> 05:16.242
Stop your shrieking Marc, I was just taking a nap

05:18.239 --> 05:20.147
But your eyes were ..

05:20.304 --> 05:21.601
I haven't slept in weeks

05:22.076 --> 05:27.976
I just wake all night, feeling so tense

05:27.976 --> 05:31.816
Well naturally, look at your desk, it's a mess

05:36.843 --> 05:38.892
Maybe something else is on your mind?

05:38.892 --> 05:41.701
Yes getting a good night sleep is on my mind

05:42.311 --> 05:45.528
I can't even take a sleeping pill because of that damn baby

05:46.972 --> 05:49.595
Marc, I need help

05:50.017 --> 05:51.256
Of course you do

05:52.774 --> 05:55.151
And I am here for you

05:55.820 --> 05:58.266
What the hell do you think you're doing?

05:58.656 --> 06:00.760
I meant I needed you to hire a night nanny

06:00.760 --> 06:04.339
Oh ok, well I'll get right on it

06:05.567 --> 06:07.023
But Willy

06:07.326 --> 06:13.366
Aren't there maybe some other night needs, that aren't being met?

06:15.623 --> 06:18.164
Willy, Willy?

06:19.200 --> 06:20.846
Agh, this is so weird

06:23.114 --> 06:25.302
Hey Betty, I've got a web thing

06:25.302 --> 06:29.053
What do you think about "fun sex versus boring relationship sex"?

06:29.053 --> 06:32.063
You can write about all the boring things you do with what's his name

06:32.063 --> 06:33.001
- Matt 
- Whatever

06:33.001 --> 06:35.688
And I can write about all the fun things I'm gonna do

06:35.688 --> 06:36.964
With whatever guy I meet tonight

06:37.079 --> 06:40.352
How about the modern-day mating rituals

06:40.352 --> 06:42.397
You know something a little less personal

06:42.397 --> 06:44.337
Ooh you slut! Why? What are you hiding?

06:44.893 --> 06:45.857
Matt's into kink isn't he?

06:45.857 --> 06:48.066
Is he your loving pig? Does he like ice cubing?

06:48.048 --> 06:49.298
- Ice what? 
- Cubing

06:49.298 --> 06:51.955
No, Matt is into normal things I think

06:53.098 --> 06:57.740
Oh my god, are you actually saying that you haven't tapped that yet?

06:58.648 --> 07:01.635
No, but we're definitely headed in that direction

07:01.635 --> 07:02.855
We just haven't got there yet

07:02.855 --> 07:03.966
This is none of your business

07:03.966 --> 07:06.306
But Betty you have been dating for like a year

07:06.306 --> 07:07.494
- A month
- Exactly

07:07.494 --> 07:11.310
And he's a billionaire and for some reason he seems to be into you

07:11.310 --> 07:14.121
What the hell are you waiting for?

07:24.968 --> 07:26.204
Betty are you wearing the La Fleur?

07:26.204 --> 07:27.155
Maybe ..

07:27.155 --> 07:28.993
Ooh what's the special occasion?

07:28.993 --> 07:33.881
Matt and I have a date and I was kinda hoping tonight will be the night

07:34.283 --> 07:36.693
Hoping? if you're ready just tell him

07:37.241 --> 07:39.935
Well it's not that easy, I mean I've never had to do that before

07:39.935 --> 07:41.851
With Henry and Walter it just kinda happened

07:41.851 --> 07:45.951
Oh yeah, well some guys need more of a push

07:46.234 --> 07:47.571
Let me see your bra

07:47.822 --> 07:48.878
What?!

07:50.127 --> 07:55.081
Aye, papi jeez, you're going camping for two days not two weeks

07:55.081 --> 07:57.599
I know! He can bring six cans of bug sprays

07:57.599 --> 07:59.206
But I can't bring a blow dryer

07:59.206 --> 08:00.786
There's no electricity

08:01.006 --> 08:02.191
Oh dear god!

08:02.747 --> 08:04.637
Hey we hit the road at 5am

08:04.637 --> 08:06.169
You girls up for an early breakfast?

08:06.375 --> 08:07.477
Well I know I'll be there

08:07.477 --> 08:09.785
I have a date with Archie so I should be in bed by 9

08:09.785 --> 08:11.771
Haha good! How about you Betty?

08:11.771 --> 08:17.003
Actually, I ..  Matt and I are gonna have a late dinner

08:17.581 --> 08:20.951
That's alright, I'll just come in and give you a little kiss before we leave

08:22.465 --> 08:25.236
Papi, I think that I'm gonna stay in the city tonight

08:25.423 --> 08:27.753
You know, get some work on my web article done

08:27.753 --> 08:30.848
How can you stay in the city, you don't have a place there anymore

08:31.682 --> 08:34.011
Jeez, papi, she's spending the night with her boyfriend

08:34.486 --> 08:36.240
Even I knew that, she's wearing lip gloss!

08:41.068 --> 08:45.149
Okay, I'll just see you when I see you, bye

08:47.540 --> 08:51.336
- Have fun! 
-Bye!

08:56.188 --> 08:57.924
Hey Daniel, can I ask you something?

08:59.386 --> 09:02.197
What do you think of me doing a poetry slam?

09:05.688 --> 09:06.687
Oh you're serious

09:06.687 --> 09:08.769
Yeah I've been writing poetry for years

09:08.769 --> 09:10.543
And I never had enough to perform any of it

09:10.543 --> 09:12.246
And it's something I've always wanted to do

09:12.246 --> 09:14.676
Then you should definitely do that

09:14.676 --> 09:15.988
You don't think it sounds crazy?

09:15.988 --> 09:17.282
I didn't say that

09:17.282 --> 09:18.641
Hey!

09:19.732 --> 09:21.796
Well seriously I think that's brave

09:21.999 --> 09:24.245
You couldn't pay me enough to get up in front of people and perform

09:24.245 --> 09:24.955
Why?

09:25.909 --> 09:28.686
Just a horrible scarring, High school rock band experience

09:28.686 --> 09:31.260
Oh my god! You were in a band? What did you play?

09:31.260 --> 09:36.786
Guitar, sort of, I thought I was really good, I was really bad!

09:37.058 --> 09:37.904
What happened?

09:38.596 --> 09:43.941
Umm I had to write this incredibly cheesy song "Crash and Burn" it was called

09:43.941 --> 09:45.833
For the battle of the bands at school

09:45.833 --> 09:47.476
I was laughed off the stage

09:47.992 --> 09:51.197
You would've laughed too though, especially if you'd seen my hair

09:52.807 --> 09:53.826
I wanna see a picture

09:53.826 --> 09:57.501
Oh no forget it, I don't wanna ruin your perfect image of me

09:57.715 --> 09:58.671
Too late

10:03.455 --> 10:09.081
Ok, Mr. protégé piano guy, how's this one?

10:09.904 --> 10:12.038
That was it, that was it! That was a perfect A-flat

10:12.038 --> 10:13.701
Shut up! You're a bad liar

10:13.701 --> 10:16.693
No, I'm not lying, I'm still deafened from when you did your C-sharp

10:16.693 --> 10:17.781
Hey!

10:32.431 --> 10:34.192
Guess I should get you a cab

10:34.192 --> 10:39.383
Or I could come upstairs and take a peek at your new wall color

10:39.383 --> 10:43.852
Hahaha .. That's funny, oh wait here comes one, taxi!

10:43.852 --> 10:46.391
No, Matt, I'm not expected home ..

10:48.879 --> 10:52.626
There you go, alright I'll call you later, bye!

10:58.433 --> 11:00.635
That guy couldn't get rid of you fast enough!

11:18.305 --> 11:23.143
Thanks Archie that's sweet, ok, talk to you later

11:23.777 --> 11:28.281
Agh, what kind of a guy calls an hour after a date to say he had a good time

11:28.738 --> 11:29.977
I think he's a little too into me

11:29.977 --> 11:33.082
He spent all night touching my arm, and trying to hold my hand

11:33.802 --> 11:37.984
Oh poor Hilda! Nice guy can't keep his hands off of you, how awful!

11:37.984 --> 11:40.466
Excuse me, what is your problem?

11:40.821 --> 11:43.137
My problem is that you've been complaining about Archie

11:43.137 --> 11:44.996
Since the two of you started seeing each other

11:44.996 --> 11:49.010
He's so into me, he calls just to say nice things

11:49.010 --> 11:51.978
If it bothers you that much, then why don't you just break up with him?

11:51.978 --> 11:55.228
Maybe you're right, I tried to do the nice guy thing

11:55.228 --> 11:56.854
What can I say, he's just not my type

11:57.936 --> 12:01.894
What are you doing home anyway, I thought tonight was supposed to be like the night

12:02.195 --> 12:04.132
Well apparently, it wasn't

12:05.183 --> 12:06.137
What happened?

12:06.137 --> 12:08.199
Nothing, nothing happened

12:08.718 --> 12:11.627
I tried to make it very clear that I wanted to stay over

12:11.627 --> 12:14.462
And he just laughed and put me in a cab

12:15.612 --> 12:17.165
Well maybe he misunderstood your signals

12:17.534 --> 12:19.158
You're very subtle, that's your style

12:20.006 --> 12:21.947
Rule number 1, never be subtle

12:23.482 --> 12:26.309
I don't know, I mean, I think subtlety works sometimes

12:26.575 --> 12:29.531
Yeah maybe 100 years ago, in like the 1950's

12:29.531 --> 12:31.851
But trust me, these days, bolder is better

12:32.860 --> 12:37.418
So what, a girl's just supposed to come out and say it?

12:37.418 --> 12:41.487
You know, like I want to ..

12:42.992 --> 12:45.215
You know, I mean not everybody can do that

12:45.355 --> 12:48.925
Oh my god! Still dry in Betty county?

12:48.925 --> 12:51.349
Still non of your business Amanda!

12:51.349 --> 12:54.763
Exactly! Betty in honor of us once being roommates

12:54.763 --> 12:57.329
I'm going to personally teach you how to be sexy

12:58.241 --> 13:00.835
Well you know, as sexy as this can be

13:01.043 --> 13:03.233
I will show you some of my no-fail moves

13:03.606 --> 13:06.342
Admit it Betty, you need a little help in this department

13:06.555 --> 13:08.414
It'll be great for our article

13:10.964 --> 13:13.122
- Well 
- Woooo

13:13.122 --> 13:16.588
Get ready, Betty, sex train is coming

13:19.796 --> 13:21.839
Agh how lame

13:22.144 --> 13:23.740
How cool, a poetry slam?

13:23.740 --> 13:26.321
Yup Molly's super excited and I've been so busy

13:26.321 --> 13:27.955
trying to keep this company together

13:28.498 --> 13:30.453
I just really want it to be a great night for her

13:30.492 --> 13:32.395
Well I'll definitely be there, I love poetry

13:32.395 --> 13:34.073
It was one of my favorite classes in college

13:34.073 --> 13:35.290
- Really?
- Yeah

13:35.991 --> 13:37.310
Maybe you should read this

13:37.310 --> 13:40.290
I think it's pretty good although I'm not much of a poetry person

13:40.290 --> 13:43.217
Softly caressing waves,  good title ..

13:48.175 --> 13:50.580
Wow, wow

13:50.580 --> 13:52.740
Wow what, wow good or wow bad

13:52.740 --> 13:59.831
Just wow! I'm impressed that Molly's reading this, it's very personal and intimate

14:00.517 --> 14:02.016
It is? I thought it was about the ocean

14:03.128 --> 14:09.587
Daniel, the ocean is a metaphor for you and her, and the two of you ..

14:10.646 --> 14:12.491
Softly caressing ..

14:13.671 --> 14:16.432
Wow, I mean I totally missed that, are you sure?

14:17.250 --> 14:22.599
Pretty sure, I lay my head on the soft pale sand breathing in his salty scent

14:23.332 --> 14:25.243
Is that supposed to be my chest?

14:25.746 --> 14:28.183
And I'm pretty sure that the rock is your head

14:28.183 --> 14:29.434
How do you know it's my head?

14:30.238 --> 14:31.412
Cause it's crying?

14:32.012 --> 14:33.835
What? Rocks don't cry

14:42.430 --> 14:45.177
Wow, it's so weird to be back here

14:45.883 --> 14:50.527
I know right? I miss the me it was with us

14:50.727 --> 14:54.652
Okay, we're ready for operation Betty sexification

14:54.946 --> 14:57.281
Amanda, I thought it was just gonna be us girls

14:57.281 --> 15:00.391
- It is 
- You can thank us later by taking us to lunch

15:00.391 --> 15:03.018
Agh, this is an impossible deadline

15:03.018 --> 15:04.825
Matt's gonna be here in two hours

15:05.471 --> 15:07.986
God, where do we even begin, look at her

15:07.986 --> 15:11.730
Umm yeah, this is a toughie, we have to stay calm

15:12.082 --> 15:15.004
The key is to come at your target using all six senses

15:15.490 --> 15:19.025
Sound, smell, taste, touch, sight and style

15:19.335 --> 15:20.646
Well technically style is ..

15:20.646 --> 15:23.804
Shhh! We have to work fast and furious if we're gonna make it in time

15:23.804 --> 15:25.306
Now, pay attention

15:25.306 --> 15:28.400
First sense sound

15:30.560 --> 15:33.592
Next sense, smell

15:38.312 --> 15:40.170
Taste

15:41.672 --> 15:44.888
Show him your lips are available and open for business

15:48.924 --> 15:51.096
Eat slowly and seductively

15:53.507 --> 15:58.978
- Touch
- Ignite his pleasure center with a soft graze

16:03.683 --> 16:06.285
Sight and style

16:06.515 --> 16:09.344
Now the art of the seductive hair flick

16:20.792 --> 16:21.701
Ok, put this on

16:21.917 --> 16:24.561
- Now, what about those braces can those come off? 
- No

16:24.970 --> 16:26.346
Can we at least lose the glasses?

16:26.555 --> 16:28.086
I kind of need them to see

16:28.086 --> 16:29.882
My concern is what he's going to see

16:29.882 --> 16:31.914
Oh and don't forget about this

16:32.624 --> 16:34.169
A ladle? What's this for?

16:34.169 --> 16:35.717
You'll know when the time comes

16:36.564 --> 16:41.922
I can't believe I'm saying this but Betty Suarez is getting some strange tonight

16:42.760 --> 16:46.621
- Hey thanks guys 
- Go get him tiger

17:12.148 --> 17:13.627
Where did he go?

17:14.161 --> 17:15.376
Where are you?

17:16.146 --> 17:17.426
Who the hell are you?

17:22.388 --> 17:23.727
I'm your new night nanny

17:24.132 --> 17:25.665
The new night nanny?

17:26.057 --> 17:27.382
What was that brawling?

17:28.215 --> 17:32.501
Oh I was reading William Goldilocks and the three bears

17:32.501 --> 17:35.388
I guess I got a little roarrr, carried away

17:36.572 --> 17:38.152
I'm Sorry if I woke you up

17:38.884 --> 17:40.872
I'm James by the way

17:43.813 --> 17:45.166
Carry on James

18:04.231 --> 18:06.982
This place is even better than last night

18:07.127 --> 18:08.582
We'll have two orders of that please

18:09.582 --> 18:12.160
You have got to try this dish, it's killing

18:12.160 --> 18:13.029
Oh?

18:14.907 --> 18:19.297
Don't move, you just look really pretty in that light

18:19.693 --> 18:21.379
Oh thank you

18:21.379 --> 18:23.101
And now you moved and it's gone

18:24.142 --> 18:25.768
Kidding it's still on

18:28.632 --> 18:33.140
Listen Archie, I think maybe ..

18:33.140 --> 18:37.389
Archie? Archie I thought that was you how are you?

18:37.389 --> 18:40.227
I'm, I'm good, real good

18:40.227 --> 18:42.932
Hilda, this is Felicia, she and I used to be neighbors

18:42.932 --> 18:45.064
Oh well we used to be more than that

18:45.064 --> 18:49.386
Biggest mistake I ever made was letting this one slip  through my fingers

18:55.213 --> 18:58.127
I thought I take a little break to make you flash cards and seduce you

18:59.653 --> 19:02.865
Oh god I love your chest so warm and cozy

19:03.606 --> 19:06.686
So I finally had a chance to read your poem

19:07.431 --> 19:10.363
You did? What did you think?

19:10.363 --> 19:11.939
Yeah it's great

19:11.939 --> 19:17.565
Had some thoughts from an editorial perspective if you want

19:17.565 --> 19:20.375
That would be great, I would love your professional opinion

19:20.626 --> 19:21.688
I'll go grab it

19:21.688 --> 19:23.486
Got it right here

19:24.443 --> 19:26.566
Wow you made a lot of notes

19:26.566 --> 19:28.792
No no, I just kinda jotted down some ideas

19:28.792 --> 19:31.817
Like um, instead of softly caressing,

19:31.817 --> 19:34.292
Maybe the waves should be hard and crashing

19:35.103 --> 19:38.293
And should this rock really sprout tears?

19:38.293 --> 19:40.194
It seems exaggerated

19:40.598 --> 19:44.877
I mean I would buy it if the rock maybe shed a single tear once

19:45.375 --> 19:47.091
Or you could just lose the image all together

19:47.091 --> 19:51.073
Ok, you wanna tell me what this is really about?

19:52.046 --> 19:55.267
I know this poem is about us, you know ..

19:56.236 --> 19:57.723
Having sex ..

19:57.723 --> 20:00.450
Yeah .. So?

20:00.450 --> 20:02.499
So you're gonna read this in public

20:02.906 --> 20:06.910
Like in front of people I work with, it's embarrassing

20:07.936 --> 20:09.482
I see

20:11.599 --> 20:14.016
Well the last thing I wanted to do is embarrass you

20:14.016 --> 20:14.861
Molly come on

20:14.861 --> 20:16.766
No it's fine, I'll just read something else

20:17.289 --> 20:18.503
I should get back to work

20:25.001 --> 20:27.283
You always did know how to make me laugh

20:27.502 --> 20:31.864
I swear the biggest mistake I ever made was letting this guy slip through my fingers

20:33.199 --> 20:34.973
Yeah, you mentioned that

20:35.331 --> 20:39.049
Felicia, maybe we should get started on our food before it gets cold

20:39.049 --> 20:41.488
Oh my god! I didn't even notice, what a jerk

20:41.970 --> 20:44.431
- It was so nice meeting you 
- Yeah, you too

20:44.431 --> 20:46.330
Call me sugar

20:48.796 --> 20:51.037
I'm sorry, Felicia is a bit of a talker

20:51.037 --> 20:56.378
I know! I was like hello, we're on a date here

21:02.501 --> 21:03.987
Come in!

21:07.443 --> 21:08.332
Hello

21:08.511 --> 21:11.992
Oh hey Matt I'll be right out I'm just changing out my work clothes

21:11.992 --> 21:12.804
Okay

21:13.657 --> 21:15.563
Wow this place is cool

21:15.563 --> 21:17.980
Now I can see why you were so bummed out when you had to give it up

21:18.706 --> 21:21.474
Uh, you know we should really get going if we're gonna make that movie

21:26.227 --> 21:28.404
What's your hurry soldier?

21:35.757 --> 21:40.087
Wow you look great, but the movie starts in like 20 minutes

21:40.087 --> 21:41.027
You should probably get dressed

21:41.027 --> 21:43.719
Actually, I was thinking

21:44.209 --> 21:49.698
Maybe we could just stay in tonight and relax

21:50.662 --> 21:55.334
Oh I made mojitos, want one?

21:55.733 --> 22:01.060
Uh, I'm not really a mojito kinda guy

22:02.368 --> 22:07.472
Oh okay, well then, we could just get comfortable

22:10.780 --> 22:14.556
And sit, we could sit

22:17.106 --> 22:19.985
Oh look what you found

22:23.314 --> 22:25.017
Sorry, here

22:26.244 --> 22:28.271
We should probably just go to that movie

22:29.563 --> 22:36.452
Or we could stay here and you know, be together ..

22:44.489 --> 22:47.146
Betty, I can't do this

22:47.837 --> 22:49.274
Matt, where are you going?

22:50.074 --> 22:54.038
Betty I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me

23:10.586 --> 23:14.510
- Wow, that was .. Wow 
- I know

23:14.510 --> 23:17.745
- I did not expect that to happen 
- Me neither

23:17.745 --> 23:23.013
I .. To be honest I actually thought you were gonna break up with me

23:25.293 --> 23:29.190
- I totally was 
- You were?

23:29.190 --> 23:33.063
Yeah, if Felicia hadn't stopped by and interrupted me,

23:33.654 --> 23:37.179
This evening would've gone a hell of a lot differently

23:37.626 --> 23:39.782
So what made you change your mind?

23:39.782 --> 23:43.894
Huh? I don't know

23:44.587 --> 23:47.285
You weren't gonna give me a chance until you saw another woman was into me

23:47.505 --> 23:51.426
What? That is not true

23:53.377 --> 23:57.707
Okay, alright maybe it is a little bit, I usually go for that kinda guy, you know

23:58.511 --> 24:01.479
Right .. So do I need Felicia to interrupt everyday to get you in the mood?

24:01.479 --> 24:04.261
Cause that would be, you know, pretty complicated foreplay

24:04.999 --> 24:10.940
No, but a little tattoo on your back wouldn't hurt

24:12.190 --> 24:13.725
You know what, I'm gonna go

24:15.820 --> 24:18.552
Excuse me what just happened here?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.123
Thanks for a memorable night

24:22.123 --> 24:24.192
I was just kidding

24:32.369 --> 24:36.318
So that is your idea of a qualified child care professional?

24:36.318 --> 24:38.005
Oh my god, he's completely qualified

24:38.005 --> 24:40.295
He's a former model and he's done diaper commercials

24:41.758 --> 24:46.213
Ok honestly, I thought that manny poppins might help you get your groove back

24:46.213 --> 24:48.143
You know, so that you can sleep better

24:48.143 --> 24:50.889
What are you implying? My groove is perfectly fine

24:50.889 --> 24:53.091
Willy, I keep your appointments remember?

24:53.255 --> 24:59.310
And I haven't scheduled you for one of your weekly "carwashes" since before Connor

25:00.604 --> 25:04.564
And .. I just thought that James could wash your car for you

25:04.564 --> 25:06.362
It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard

25:06.441 --> 25:09.206
Oh come on, he's totally hot, he looks like Taye Diggs

25:09.206 --> 25:11.401
What is it with white people and Taye Diggs?

25:11.401 --> 25:13.567
Fine, I will call another nanny

25:14.541 --> 25:17.718
Wait, he does already know the apartment

25:17.907 --> 25:20.874
So he can stay .. For now

25:21.938 --> 25:24.264
Oh and book me a Brazilian with Jonny

25:24.715 --> 25:25.579
Oooh

25:25.966 --> 25:27.763
Completely unrelated

25:34.192 --> 25:35.492
It went horribly

25:35.522 --> 25:37.915
What? Our moves didn't work? Impossible

25:37.915 --> 25:38.775
Those moves are fabby

25:38.775 --> 25:40.012
You must've done something wrong

25:40.012 --> 25:41.215
Did you do the hair flick?

25:41.215 --> 25:42.168
Or use the ladle

25:42.168 --> 25:44.653
Guys don't worry, it wasn't your moves, it was me

25:44.916 --> 25:46.354
The whole night was a disaster

25:46.354 --> 25:49.919
I practically threw myself at him and he ran out the door

25:49.919 --> 25:53.100
Running away from a girl screaming? That sounds like my prom night

25:53.508 --> 25:54.919
Oh My god he's gay

25:54.919 --> 25:56.478
- Or a virgin 
- Or a woman

25:56.478 --> 25:57.852
Umm that feels right

25:58.372 --> 26:00.110
Well, I just, I wanna talk to him about it

26:00.110 --> 26:03.043
But I can't because he just texted me and he's working through lunch

26:03.842 --> 26:05.942
Um, that does not fly with me

26:06.123 --> 26:08.453
If I were you I would march over to his office right now

26:08.453 --> 26:09.561
And give him a piece of my mind

26:09.561 --> 26:11.471
Oh Betty's not the type to do something like that

26:11.688 --> 26:12.953
You know what, I'm going to

26:12.989 --> 26:15.493
Wow, aren't you full of surprises

26:15.493 --> 26:18.979
I just .. I can't take another second of replaying last night in my head

26:19.017 --> 26:21.502
I'll go nuts, I just need to talk to him

26:21.502 --> 26:23.065
Right after you buy us lunch

26:26.452 --> 26:27.704
That's Matt's building

26:28.688 --> 26:29.711
I don't know what I'm gonna say to him

26:29.711 --> 26:30.814
What am I gonna say to him?

26:30.814 --> 26:33.610
Oh well you better think fast cause Richie Rich just left the building

26:34.646 --> 26:35.883
No, Amanda!

26:38.641 --> 26:41.574
Someone's not working through lunch, we should follow him

26:41.998 --> 26:43.890
No guys, I'm not gonna do that

26:43.890 --> 26:45.936
Well if you don't, then we will

26:46.524 --> 26:48.275
No, no, Amanda, Marc!

26:52.707 --> 26:54.604
It's kinda silly, guys slow down

26:55.100 --> 26:56.035
Oh god

27:05.217 --> 27:07.858
This is stupid, why are we doing this

27:07.858 --> 27:10.589
I know, I just wanna finish this episode of mex in the city

27:10.589 --> 27:12.777
And get something to eat, my stomach is eating itself

27:13.939 --> 27:15.341
The bagel has landed

27:17.568 --> 27:18.488
Hey

27:20.207 --> 27:24.591
Oh-my-god, he is totally two-timing you

27:25.853 --> 27:27.165
There must be an explanation for this

27:27.165 --> 27:30.496
Agh, let's get this show on the road, I'm starving

27:35.028 --> 27:36.058
Betty?

27:37.153 --> 27:38.763
Betty what are you doing here?

27:41.182 --> 27:42.947
Oh it's a beautiful day

27:43.949 --> 27:48.687
Matt, hey, hi

27:49.989 --> 27:52.125
I didn't mean to follow you

27:53.169 --> 27:57.358
I'm just still a little confused about last night and ..

27:58.036 --> 28:02.174
If you're with her that's fine, I mean it's not fine but ..

28:03.047 --> 28:05.379
Oh god, I wish I wasn't here right now

28:06.005 --> 28:07.973
- I'm Helen 
- My therapist

28:08.955 --> 28:10.147
Why don't you join us?

28:18.918 --> 28:20.854
Betty sorry I said I have to work through lunch

28:21.606 --> 28:23.565
I just needed to see Helen

28:27.553 --> 28:29.208
I don't know what I'm supposed to say

28:29.819 --> 28:34.423
You can say, or not say anything you wanna say or not say

28:36.127 --> 28:37.007
Ok ..

28:39.385 --> 28:42.259
So um, about last night

28:42.259 --> 28:43.790
Look Matt, it was my fault

28:44.015 --> 28:47.770
I was trying to push you into doing something you obviously don't wanna do so ..

28:47.770 --> 28:49.689
No, no, no, that's not it at all

28:49.689 --> 28:52.957
Matt, it's fine, just tell me if you're not attracted to me

28:52.957 --> 28:54.435
Or if you'd rather just stay friends

28:54.435 --> 28:56.344
No, I am attracted to you

28:56.660 --> 28:57.923
Well then was it

29:01.139 --> 29:02.840
Oh god, this is so embarrassing

29:02.840 --> 29:03.795
Why?

29:06.879 --> 29:09.983
Oh, are you a virgin?

29:10.624 --> 29:13.225
That's okay I don't really have that much experience either

29:13.225 --> 29:15.289
Oh no, I've been with women

29:16.579 --> 29:19.403
And kind of a lot of women

29:20.497 --> 29:23.103
And really lot

29:23.377 --> 29:24.527
Wow

29:25.866 --> 29:27.946
Look, look I know this must sound weird

29:28.227 --> 29:31.945
It's just, I've been kinda lonely my whole life

29:32.152 --> 29:35.076
In the past Matt has used sex as a way to connect to people

29:35.076 --> 29:38.622
So I made a contract with Helen that I wouldn't be with someone

29:38.622 --> 29:41.486
Until I really connected with them first

29:42.218 --> 29:46.142
And .. This amazing thing happened, I met you

29:46.944 --> 29:49.663
And I started having all these feelings

29:51.019 --> 29:54.672
And then when the sex came up I guess I just .. I just panicked

29:56.732 --> 29:57.931
And how do you feel now?

30:00.994 --> 30:03.729
Calm, I feel calm

30:03.729 --> 30:04.680
Good

30:04.998 --> 30:06.954
I'm so glad it's out in the open

30:08.769 --> 30:11.394
And Betty how do you feel?

30:14.995 --> 30:17.921
Great, I feel ..

30:20.355 --> 30:21.222
Strange

30:21.916 --> 30:23.490
Matt's been with hundreds of women?

30:23.490 --> 30:27.494
Well he didn't say hundreds but he's definitely pointing in that direction

30:27.494 --> 30:29.153
Man what a dog!

30:29.153 --> 30:30.975
Not really helping, I know

30:30.975 --> 30:32.825
No you're not, can we change the subject

30:32.825 --> 30:35.217
Your car's coming to pick you up to take you straight to the poetry club from here

30:35.217 --> 30:37.351
Great, you're coming right?

30:37.351 --> 30:40.242
Yeah, I'll be there, I'm excited to hear Molly read her poem

30:40.242 --> 30:42.031
Oh she's not gonna read that one anymore

30:42.031 --> 30:43.587
Why? It's so beautiful

30:43.587 --> 30:45.123
I asked her not to

30:45.123 --> 30:46.103
What?

30:46.180 --> 30:47.332
Well you saw what it was about

30:47.332 --> 30:51.017
I can't exactly have her reading stuff about our sex life in front of everyone I work with

30:51.017 --> 30:52.611
Daniel, sorry to break it to you

30:52.611 --> 30:54.987
But your sex life has kinda been on display for years

30:54.987 --> 30:56.618
Come on, that's different

30:56.884 --> 30:59.732
Why? Because you don't mind people knowing that you're a playboy

30:59.732 --> 31:03.711
But you don't want anyone to know that you cry when you're with the woman you love?

31:03.784 --> 31:05.233
Okay, you're making me sound like an ass

31:05.233 --> 31:06.646
Well you kind of are

31:07.356 --> 31:11.530
I'm sorry, but Molly's sick, and she wrote a poem about how much she loves you

31:12.368 --> 31:15.253
And she's brave enough to stand up in front of strangers and say that

31:15.939 --> 31:17.627
You can be brave enough to let her

31:26.930 --> 31:29.280
So we talked it through and Archie's coming over

31:29.512 --> 31:31.951
Hilda, you called a guy back and apologized?

31:32.694 --> 31:34.919
Wow, you must really like this Archie

31:34.919 --> 31:37.786
I know! Something happened last night,

31:37.786 --> 31:40.549
It's like we really .. We really connected you know

31:44.711 --> 31:46.892
Can we maybe not talk about sex tonight?

31:47.200 --> 31:49.245
Oh honey, you and Matt you're gonna be fine

31:49.245 --> 31:50.438
I don't know Hilda

31:50.438 --> 31:54.188
I mean a couple of days ago I was ready to spend the night

31:54.901 --> 31:57.242
And now I hope it doesn't even come up

31:57.447 --> 31:59.700
Honey he talked to his shrink about you

31:59.889 --> 32:01.247
Obviously you're important to him

32:01.247 --> 32:03.688
It's just complicated, now I'm one of hundreds

32:04.164 --> 32:05.682
I don't feel very special

32:05.829 --> 32:09.625
Agh wouldn't it be great if all of life's problems could be solved with good hair

32:09.625 --> 32:11.059
Alright cover up

32:13.378 --> 32:15.660
That must be Archie, come in

32:18.592 --> 32:20.386
Felicia, what are you doing here?

32:20.715 --> 32:22.512
I came to tell you to back off my man

32:23.089 --> 32:24.258
Excuse me?

32:24.258 --> 32:26.046
I decided I want Archie back

32:26.046 --> 32:29.047
Oh, sorry you can't have him

32:29.762 --> 32:31.591
No offense but you can't stop me

32:31.591 --> 32:34.779
Archie loves him some Vanilla ice cream

32:34.779 --> 32:36.749
Okay you know maybe ..

32:36.749 --> 32:40.701
Well no offense, but I don't think Archie's gonna go back to vanilla

32:40.701 --> 32:45.287
When he has tasted hot, melted, caramel surprise

32:45.287 --> 32:47.863
What's the surprise? Your fat ass?

32:48.066 --> 32:50.927
- Oh No you didn't 
- No, no Hilda, she didn't mean that

32:50.927 --> 32:53.444
Oh yes I did, and I also meant to do this

32:56.330 --> 32:57.034
Oh bitch

32:57.034 --> 32:58.123
How do you like that

32:58.123 --> 33:00.693
- Hope you like eggs cause your head's about to look like one 
- No, no

33:00.693 --> 33:02.438
Is that all you got?

33:02.438 --> 33:04.442
At least let me get these eyebrows

33:04.442 --> 33:05.672
You're gonna hurt somebody

33:05.672 --> 33:07.631
Stop, stop!

33:07.866 --> 33:08.556
Are you crazy?

33:08.556 --> 33:10.763
What the hell is going on here?

33:24.726 --> 33:27.589
It's so chilly in here, do you mind if I start a fire?

33:28.009 --> 33:28.680
Sure

33:45.760 --> 33:48.993
Oh it looks like you have a little something on your shirt

33:48.993 --> 33:51.871
Oh I guess the baby spit up a little

33:51.871 --> 33:53.220
It's no big deal

33:53.220 --> 33:57.951
Oh nonsense, let me wash it, I was just about to do a little laundry

33:59.488 --> 34:00.541
Okay

34:10.045 --> 34:13.188
- Thank you 
- You're welcome, thank you!

34:21.911 --> 34:23.880
Thank you, thank you

34:27.681 --> 34:30.746
Hey hey, I'm really glad that we talked with Helen today

34:30.746 --> 34:33.132
I mean it was weird, but I'm glad

34:33.132 --> 34:35.433
Yeah yeah me too

34:41.018 --> 34:41.938
Who's that?

34:41.938 --> 34:44.626
Oh she works at the coffee shop near my apartment

34:45.658 --> 34:49.772
Hey hey, it's the only place I know her from in case you're wondering

34:49.772 --> 34:53.382
What? No, no, I wasn't wondering anything

34:57.937 --> 34:59.552
Your shirt will be done soon

34:59.552 --> 35:03.922
So in the mean time why don't we ..

35:19.824 --> 35:24.572
- Are you okay? 
- I'm fine

35:28.236 --> 35:31.476
And there I sit wrapped oh so tight against the night

35:32.516 --> 35:37.420
In my insecurity, like it

35:42.213 --> 35:46.253
Molly, hey I'm so sorry about what I said before

35:46.482 --> 35:49.479
This poem you wrote is beautiful and it's touching

35:49.479 --> 35:52.375
And I'd be so proud to hear you read it tonight

35:52.715 --> 35:53.724
You would?

35:57.229 --> 35:58.443
Molly, you're up

35:59.500 --> 36:00.770
Get em, take it

36:04.471 --> 36:08.180
I'm just so angry at myself I knew I shouldn't have let Connor in

36:09.058 --> 36:11.178
It was against every instinct I had

36:11.619 --> 36:15.319
Now I can't get his stupid face out of my dreams

36:15.619 --> 36:20.498
Shh, that's it, that's it, let it out

36:21.348 --> 36:24.911
I don't wanna let it out, I just wanna have sex

36:25.677 --> 36:28.654
Uh, I didn't, I didn't ..

36:28.654 --> 36:30.445
Oh just take your pants off

36:30.483 --> 36:32.707
I don't think what you need is sex

36:33.240 --> 36:37.235
What I think you need is to find a way to close the door on this Connor guy

36:37.795 --> 36:39.842
And focus on your baby

36:43.568 --> 36:45.717
Well thank you James

36:49.661 --> 36:52.343
I think you really helped me

36:53.155 --> 36:56.274
And since we won't be having sex, now you're fired

36:57.879 --> 37:01.445
Get out .. Out

37:12.084 --> 37:13.239
Oh great thank you

37:31.928 --> 37:33.520
Betty, Betty you're okay?

37:34.952 --> 37:38.556
Sorry, I'm gonna go say bye to Daniel

37:48.739 --> 37:49.786
Did you finally get rid of her?

37:49.786 --> 37:53.036
Yeah and don't worry Felicia won't bother you anymore I promise

37:53.036 --> 37:54.819
Oh I know

37:55.935 --> 37:58.147
So what's going on here?

37:58.147 --> 38:01.101
Yesterday you're not into me and today you're fighting for me

38:01.414 --> 38:02.882
I thought I wasn't your type

38:02.882 --> 38:05.586
Ok, I know it was a really dumb thing to say

38:05.586 --> 38:10.580
Especially since my type hasn't really worked out for me so well

38:11.454 --> 38:15.897
I just wanted to see what it would be like you know with a nice guy

38:16.960 --> 38:20.701
Hilda I like you but I'm sorry to warn you I have a type too

38:20.701 --> 38:23.977
I think I sorta go for the bad girls

38:24.931 --> 38:26.079
You think I'm a bad girl?

38:27.121 --> 38:29.050
Well maybe I'm a little bad but..

38:29.981 --> 38:33.905
You loved it, two girls going at it over you

38:34.356 --> 38:37.354
Please, I'm a grown man, I hardly think I need to get my thrills ..

38:37.354 --> 38:41.017
- You loved it 
- I know it was really hot

38:44.634 --> 38:47.009
So what are we saying? We're giving us another chance?

38:47.746 --> 38:48.931
Yeah

38:49.608 --> 38:54.857
And oh by the way, I'm not always such a nice guy

38:55.763 --> 38:56.958
I know

38:58.490 --> 38:59.570
I'm home

39:00.825 --> 39:03.699
Oh my god Imma start ringing the bell

39:11.927 --> 39:12.941
I liked Molly's poem

39:12.941 --> 39:14.168
Yeah

39:15.219 --> 39:16.840
Does Daniel cry at work too?

39:17.336 --> 39:18.479
Not everyday

39:19.441 --> 39:20.939
So I guess I should get a cab

39:20.939 --> 39:25.688
Wait Betty wait, I was thinking maybe you could come back to my place

39:26.109 --> 39:28.692
See my new wall color, I mean if you want

39:29.724 --> 39:31.523
Matt, I don't know

39:32.199 --> 39:33.869
- You're freaked out
- Yeah

39:36.409 --> 39:38.860
I just .. I wanted to be special and ..

39:39.826 --> 39:42.932
I'm sorry but right now I just .. I feel like a number

39:43.150 --> 39:45.385
You are! Number one

39:45.679 --> 39:47.940
- Come on, Matt I'm serious 
- No so am I

39:47.940 --> 39:55.429
Betty, this would be the first time that I have ever been with a woman I really care about

39:56.121 --> 39:59.043
So technically, you are my first

40:00.293 --> 40:05.474
Aww, that's so corny and sweet

40:07.502 --> 40:12.413
- I make myself nervous my hands are shaking 
- No, don't worry, so are mine

40:28.998 --> 40:30.858
This one goes out to the woman I love

40:31.311 --> 40:34.278
A classic from my high school battle of the bands

40:37.312 --> 40:40.147
We're driving down the highway

40:40.300 --> 40:42.955
Cold wind in my hair

40:43.185 --> 40:45.814
Just me and my special lady

40:46.239 --> 40:51.253
We haven't got a care .. In the world

40:55.069 --> 41:00.785
But the road ahead's uncertain, there'll be bumps along the way

41:01.005 --> 41:08.834
And I know there'll be some hurting so I hit the gas and pray

41:11.506 --> 41:14.233
Well I don't wanna crash and burn

41:14.685 --> 41:17.495
Don't wanna go too fast

41:17.776 --> 41:23.240
Wanna be with you, wanna see this through

41:23.515 --> 41:26.360
I don't wanna crash and burn

41:26.360 --> 41:29.528
Don't wanna go too fast

41:29.618 --> 41:32.990
I want to be with you

41:32.990 --> 41:39.232
Wanna make this last forever

41:40.719 --> 41:45.441
And ever my lady

41:45.441 --> 41:48.161
