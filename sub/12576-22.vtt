WEBVTT

00:40.457 --> 00:44.419
Grandma, you put the cookies
back in breakfast.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.342
Oh, my goodness, the time.
I am field tripping in an hour

00:51.426 --> 00:53.261
and I can't remember
any good songs for the bus.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.306
Now, what does that John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt do again?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.017
He goes out. People shout.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.852
Not a whole lot more is known about him.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.230
I'm sorry, honey but I don't have time
to cook you breakfast.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.190
Here.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.902
Promise me that you'll eat two bowls.
It is the most important meal of the day.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.070
Okay.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.656
I love you, grandma.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.122
Morning, son.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.207
Did your mom have time

01:22.207 --> 01:23.958
to cook you breakfast before she left?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.710
- No.
- Oh, geez.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.212
We got any cereal?

01:27.670 --> 01:28.838
I believe we do.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.218
What is that, oatmeal? Ugh!

01:33.718 --> 01:35.303
Better put some sugar on that.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.434
<i>Alright. Now, as you all know,
Mother's Day is coming up</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:43.103
and I thought it might be fun

01:43.103 --> 01:46.106
to talk about famous moms
throughout history who...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.023
Owned slaves.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.025
Uh... No.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.652
What I was going to...

01:50.652 --> 01:51.694
Going to say.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.696
Yes. What I was going...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.365
- to say...
- Going to say, going to say.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.534
We heard the preview,
now get to the feature!

01:57.534 --> 01:58.535
- Bobby...

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

02:01.412 --> 02:02.789
I think you better see the nurse.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.790
Okay.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.128
<i>Mr. Hill, I've diagnosed your son</i>

02:08.128 --> 02:10.046
with attention deficit disorder.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.714
He's probably had it for years.

02:12.006 --> 02:15.176
What? Well, how come nobody
ever noticed this before?

02:15.385 --> 02:18.513
Very few people have access
to the pamphlets I do.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.223
Here, take one.

02:21.141 --> 02:25.145
Huh. You know I have noticed
the boy's mind wanders sometimes

02:25.270 --> 02:26.271
when I'm lecturing him.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.648
A mental disorder would explain that.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.316
Personally, I recommend

02:30.400 --> 02:31.317
putting him on one

02:31.401 --> 02:34.821
of the many popular
A.D.D medications now available.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.575
I don't like the idea
of putting my boy on drugs.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.035
Isn't there some kind of operation?

02:41.369 --> 02:42.745
Your only other option

02:42.829 --> 02:45.540
is to send him to the special
school across town.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.292
He'll have to wear a uniform.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.960
Can he button his own shirt?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.879
You bastards.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.506
<i>Ritalin,</i>

02:53.756 --> 02:57.260
cylert, tofranil, deseprimine...

02:57.552 --> 02:59.846
All sounds like goofathol to me.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.931
What if this is all my fault?

03:02.098 --> 03:03.725
A mother should be there for her baby

03:03.725 --> 03:05.935
when he's in trouble,
not halfway across town.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.105
Oh, sure, I'm a hotshot substitute teacher

03:09.355 --> 03:10.982
but sometimes I don't even have time

03:10.982 --> 03:12.567
to make my own son breakfast.

03:13.067 --> 03:17.238
Huh. Well, it is called
attention deficit disorder.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.949
Maybe the boy's
not getting enough attention.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.746
Sometimes I think
I should just quit my job

03:24.746 --> 03:26.998
and devote myself full-time
to being a mother.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.459
Uh, you know what am I saying?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.002
Quit my job?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.086
That's crazy talk.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.755
Now, wait a minute, Peggy.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.798
Crazy is a very strong word.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.258
You're just thinking out loud.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.968
Bobby is crazy.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.763
I just couldn't turn my back on
my career like that.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.931
I'll tell you what, Peggy.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.433
My own mom never worked in her life.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.602
Home, that's what mattered to her

03:47.602 --> 03:50.146
and she just kept
making it stronger every day

03:50.230 --> 03:51.105
until the divorce.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.650
Well, I will save some money

03:53.650 --> 03:55.526
on faculty room football pools

03:56.152 --> 03:58.529
and I can get another
year out of these glasses.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.740
Maybe we can try it a little while

04:01.491 --> 04:02.367
for Bobby's sake.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.744
Hank, if you'll support me on this,

04:05.703 --> 04:06.704
baby, I'll do it.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.084
<i>Now, the main thing is not to worry.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:12.585
What you have is...

04:12.919 --> 04:15.755
Well, technically, they call it a disease.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.298
A disease?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.301
But not a regular disease
like you get in your body.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.596
It's a much more... rare disease

04:24.013 --> 04:24.931
in your brain.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.976
Now, I know we've talked a lot

04:27.976 --> 04:30.061
about how you should never do drugs

04:30.520 --> 04:32.939
but from now on,
you'll be taking medication

04:32.939 --> 04:34.315
after every meal.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.568
So, do I smoke it or snort it, or what?

04:38.361 --> 04:39.696
It's a pill, Bobby.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.948
So, I guess I'll just pop it, then.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.491
You will not pop it.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.119
You will place it in your mouth.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.412
Bobby,

04:47.662 --> 04:49.205
do you know who I am?

04:49.789 --> 04:53.001
I'm Luanne, remember?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.586
He has A.D.D, Luanne.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.630
He didn't get hit in the head
with a coconut.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.384
Here you go, my little angel.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.636
Now that I'm not working
I had time to make you

05:03.886 --> 05:06.264
pancakes, and we've got eggs and bacon

05:06.472 --> 05:08.558
arranged in one of three
facial expressions

05:08.558 --> 05:09.767
depending upon your mood.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.395
Well, I guess I'll take happy

05:12.687 --> 05:15.857
as in happy about this
old-fashioned family breakfast.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.820
I better go soon,
or I'm going to miss my bus.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.280
Oh.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.698
But I made...

05:24.449 --> 05:26.034
Well, Bobby, this is it.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.244
You're going to take your first pill now

05:28.745 --> 05:31.205
and in about a half hour,
you should find yourself

05:31.289 --> 05:32.707
real interested in stuff

05:32.707 --> 05:35.084
that would normally
bore the pants off you.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.966
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes

05:42.050 --> 05:44.427
when he eats it, nobody knows.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.514
Well, what have we here?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.391
Just pop the pill, Bobby.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.436
Feel anything yet?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.856
Starting to...

06:07.909 --> 06:10.036
Anyway, and then,
after I sent him off to school

06:10.036 --> 06:12.413
I did a bunch of errands,
and I still had time

06:12.497 --> 06:14.582
to submit a quotable quote
to Reader's Digest.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.211
Some people like to stay as busy as a bee

06:18.753 --> 06:21.881
but I like to stay as busy as a bee plus.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.428
Oh! But you know, I almost worry

06:27.512 --> 06:28.888
I have too much time now.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.349
That can be a problem, Peg.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.726
Myself, I clip coupons.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.020
I think we'd all go a little crazy

06:36.104 --> 06:37.313
without coupons.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.320
Ah, that's funny.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.365
Uh.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.913
There are 96 ridges on every checker

06:54.205 --> 06:56.082
except this one.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.502
Family game time.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.753
I love it.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.588
So, how was your day, Peggy?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.590
Well, I bought an ice cube tray.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.759
Then I took it back.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.138
Well, I tell you what,
I think I may get out the guitar

07:10.138 --> 07:12.265
and have a family sing-along tonight

07:12.598 --> 07:14.976
just like we used to that one time.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.396
Just got to drop by Earl's
and get Betsy some new strings.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.480
You're leaving the house?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.524
- You don't have to come, Peggy.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.859
I'm sure you've had a full day.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.027
- Just stay here and relax.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.112
Let's go!

07:27.155 --> 07:28.114
<i>Hmm. Funny.</i>

07:28.364 --> 07:30.616
I never saw Peggy as
the stay-at-home type.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.619
Well, she's got two full-time jobs now.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.996
Wife and mother.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.831
It's longer hours and less pay

07:36.831 --> 07:38.332
but you don't hear me complaining.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.292
Heh-heh-heh.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.961
Ah. Seriously, though, we're loving it.

07:56.058 --> 07:56.934
Hmm.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.812
<i>So, you know a few chords</i>

07:59.896 --> 08:00.730
already, then?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.231
Huh? Oh, yes.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.650
I have picked up a couple
from my husband, and that...

08:05.568 --> 08:06.694
Is that a tattoo?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.154
Uh-huh. You like it?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.238
Do I like it?

08:10.865 --> 08:11.699
Oh, my.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.203
So, w-what makes you
want to play music, Peggy?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.955
Well, my husband and I
recently had to make a choice

08:18.039 --> 08:19.916
between our child and my career

08:20.458 --> 08:22.168
and it's left me with some time to fill.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.629
Filling time.
Yeah, that's what I thought I was doing

08:24.795 --> 08:26.172
when I started playing music.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.258
Turned out I was really looking
for a voice to scream with.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.010
Well, I don't know if my husband

08:31.010 --> 08:33.012
would appreciate screaming in the house

08:33.012 --> 08:35.348
but let's see.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.100
Well, he might have to get used to it.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.905
There's some milk in the fridge

08:50.905 --> 08:52.782
that's about to go bad.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.286
And there it goes.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.371
Mm.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.499
I wish I had those miracle smart pills.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.376
You know, the way Peggy's been baking

09:03.376 --> 09:05.711
there won't be a window sill in our house

09:05.795 --> 09:07.630
that doesn't have a pie cooling on it.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.509
I tell you, family values are
in again at the Hill house.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.761
Yeah, you're a lucky man, Hank.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.971
You know, my ex-wife

09:14.971 --> 09:16.973
she was a careerist, you know.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.309
One day, I had to say to her,
honey, make a choice.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.646
It's either me or the motivational
poster industry.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.315
Boy, I wish I hadn't said that.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.694
You know what the root
of the problem is, don't you?

09:29.944 --> 09:30.945
Feminism.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.864
Gloria Steinbrenner,
that's what started it.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.825
Gerald Ford should've killed her

09:35.825 --> 09:37.285
when he had the chance.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.833
Hey, I'm looking for the Hill house.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.710
The Hank Hill house?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.795
The Peggy Hill house.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.213
I'm her guitar teacher.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.716
Oh. Just go right around to the front.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.426
I thought you said

09:53.426 --> 09:56.012
family values were in at your house.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.473
Yeah, Hank. That gal's dressed
kind of pro-choice.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.809
Here's one for practicing C and G.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.728
You said you wanted stuff
with strong lyrics?

10:04.020 --> 10:07.148
That's right, but no cursing
and no cop killing.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.734
I am sorry, but that
is just how I was raised.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.403
Maybe you ought to try writing
a song of your own, Peggy.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.779
I bet a woman in your situation

10:13.863 --> 10:15.156
would have a lot to say.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.657
And what situation is that?

10:16.949 --> 10:19.577
Well, you know. Having to give up
your life's work

10:19.577 --> 10:21.579
to make things easier
for the rest of your family.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.707
Yeah, I suppose a situation like that
should make me want to sing.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.833
Oh.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.461
Come to think of it. Yesterday,
the oddest little tune

10:28.669 --> 10:29.670
popped into my head.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.130
It's sort of silly, but...

10:31.130 --> 10:33.299
Well, you'll tell me
if there's something to it.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.511
<i>♪ There once was a turtle ♪</i>

10:37.678 --> 10:40.014
<i>♪ That lived in her shell ♪</i>

10:40.389 --> 10:42.475
<i>♪ The shell was her home ♪</i>

10:42.725 --> 10:45.603
<i>♪ And her prison as well ♪</i>

10:46.228 --> 10:47.188
Whoa.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.690
There's definitely something to that.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.901
Really? Well, thank you.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.654
You know, I had a feeling
it was very, very good.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.282
Every girl band deserves funding.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.909
Great. I will remember that.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.995
So, your guitar teacher
looks pretty interesting.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.539
And by interesting, I mean weird.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.041
Well, she is weird.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.085
And by weird, I mean interesting.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.504
I invited her over for dinner tomorrow.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.089
What? Why in the world

11:13.089 --> 11:14.632
would you do something like that?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.384
Well, because she has a tattoo, Hank.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.927
Don't you think a girl like that

11:18.052 --> 11:19.428
could use a home-cooked meal?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.142
You know, Emily, Hank plays guitar, too.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.104
He has a Guild Solid Top, 1963.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.980
Wow. So how come you're practicing

11:30.064 --> 11:32.066
on that old plywood one, Peggy?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.527
Ooh, I wouldn't think of touching Betsy.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.320
You named your guitar Betsy?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.490
Yep. It's one of my most
precious possessions.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.492
Interesting.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.246
When's my next pill?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.956
Not until after dinner, honey.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.625
I'm going to take a little nap, please.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.962
Paying attention all day tires me out.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.342
So, Emily, Peggy tells me

11:58.426 --> 12:00.386
you've been helping her write music

12:00.678 --> 12:02.763
working with her and putting ideas

12:02.847 --> 12:04.181
in her head and such.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.227
You know, I was thinking
about that turtle song of yours.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.229
If you come up with a few more verses

12:10.229 --> 12:12.106
you could sing it at
my Mother's Day recital.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.399
You mean in front of people?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.526
Oh, well, I do miss performing.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.487
That's what a teacher is you know
just a great performer.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.656
It's one of the reasons
children love school.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.992
Yeah, the recital's a pretty casual thing.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.536
Me and some of my students take over
the back room with girls

12:25.536 --> 12:27.288
drink some wine, play some songs

12:27.288 --> 12:29.331
just kind of take
a little potshot at the holiday.

12:29.415 --> 12:33.002
Why would anyone want to take
a potshot at Mother's Day?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.379
Well, it's kind of bizarre,
don't you think?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.924
The greeting card companies
invented this holiday in 1914

12:39.008 --> 12:41.886
and now, the whole country
celebrates another stereotype

12:41.886 --> 12:43.262
of what women are supposed to be.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.723
You're not married, are you, Emily?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.058
So this recital, what time would it be?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.435
Don't answer that.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.854
We already have plans for Mother's Day.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.149
Peggy's starting an exciting
new life as a homemaker

12:55.149 --> 12:57.318
and to celebrate, we are having brunch.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.820
But brunch can be
almost anytime, can't it?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.655
I mean, that's the magic of brunch.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.282
But not just brunch, either.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.909
It's gonna be a whole day

13:04.909 --> 13:06.660
where you won't have to lift a finger.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.163
Just let us take care of everything.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.123
She won't have
to use her brain at all then.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.124
That's right.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.959
Interesting.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.754
- Bobby, it's time for your next pill.

13:21.425 --> 13:25.763
- <i>♪ The turtle got frightened ♪</i>

13:25.763 --> 13:30.684
<i>♪ And wanted to hide... ♪</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:36.649
<i>♪ So she tucked her head into ♪</i>

13:37.024 --> 13:42.488

13:44.114 --> 13:46.450
Hank, you are groaning
every time I sing a line.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.369
Oh, am I? I'm sorry.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.413
Do you like my song?

13:51.872 --> 13:55.125
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure I get it.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.585
Well, there's nothing to get.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.462
It's just a song about a turtle.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.881
Yeah, but I think
I know something about music

14:00.965 --> 14:02.675
having listened to it a lot.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.470
And I tell you one thing. You need to put
something upbeat in there.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.223
Upbeat? No, no, that would
never work in this song.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.142
Sure, it would. You just tack
something on at the end

14:12.226 --> 14:13.435
where it all works out.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.187
For instance, the girl turtle

14:15.271 --> 14:17.648
could meet a guy turtle and fall in love.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.109
See. Then the song is
really about something.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.277
Can you see that?

14:21.443 --> 14:24.238
Oh, please.
That is so old-fashioned, Hank.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.824
Yes, old-fashioned, as in good.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.453
Luanne's home.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.458
I just don't understand
why you have to keep singing

14:36.542 --> 14:38.377
that depressing turtle song.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.462
I don't know either, Hank, but I do.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.840
I feel very strange lately.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.176
Last night, I dream we had 20 children.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.263
Peggy, you know I can't
give you more children.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.640
I have a narrow urethra.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.976
Hank, that's not what it meant at all.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.229
Well, forgive me, but I don't know what
anything means anymore.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.564
I thought we agreed

14:58.564 --> 15:00.983
to take a big step backwards together

15:01.317 --> 15:03.777
but it sounds like you'd
rather play punk music

15:03.861 --> 15:05.154
with your hippie friends

15:05.154 --> 15:06.822
on boring old Mother's Day.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.157
Well, it is my day.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.284
I should be able to do whatever I want!

15:10.451 --> 15:12.036
Not whatever you want.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.871
You can't kill a man.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.664
Then you'd end up in prison.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.959
And with that attitude,
they'll put you in the hole!

15:23.881 --> 15:25.466
<i>Happy Mother's Day, mom.</i>

15:25.466 --> 15:28.010
I wish I was there
to shake your hand in person.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.095
So, where are you kids
having brunch today?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.639
Luly's? Joe-bo's?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.349
We're not doing brunch, mom.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.477
Peggy decided she'd rather
go to a rock concert.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.562
On Mother's Day? Why?

15:38.896 --> 15:39.897
I don't know.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.107
Peggy's just not like you, I guess.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.818
You devoted your whole life to raising me

15:44.902 --> 15:46.236
and, let's be honest

15:46.320 --> 15:47.738
you loved every second of it.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.032
Well, actually, Hank, I took odd jobs

15:50.032 --> 15:53.118
you know, as often as I could,
just to get out of the house.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.454
Don't you remember
that year I drove a taxi?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
No. Well, wait a minute.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.917
I remember you had
a yellow car when I was little.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.002
Oh, uh, Hank, I got to go.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.421
Uh, Gary's here with
my Mother's Day present.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.422
But wait, mom.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.548
I love you, too, honey.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.592
Got to go.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.802
I hope you like it.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.054
I can't return it.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.515
I tried to study for
my beauty exam

16:14.515 --> 16:16.308
but I couldn't concentrate.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.686
And then, I tried to figure out why

16:18.686 --> 16:20.270
and... and I got bored.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.773
You must have caught my A.D.D.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.566
And I know when, too.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.902
It was that time I sneezed in your face.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.613
Oh... I don't remember that.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.824
Well, you were asleep.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.493
Bobby, I've got a test tomorrow morning...

16:34.743 --> 16:37.371
or afternoon, or evening or something...

16:37.371 --> 16:38.914
Bobby, I need that pill.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.800
Hey, man, Hank, I tell you, man.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.052
You don't remember
this little old lady right here, man?

16:52.177 --> 16:53.595
I certainly do.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.597
Happy Mother's Day, Mrs. Boomhauer.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.890
Yeah, I tell you what, Hank.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.517
I come around here like that heh-heh

16:58.642 --> 16:59.977
and then for dang old brunch, man.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.311
I raised this boy right.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.646
He's just a little old thing.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.481
It's, like, the best dang day of the year.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.528
<i>♪ Met a guy in my boxing class ♪</i>

17:52.029 --> 17:55.908
<i>♪ I slept with him

17:56.033 --> 17:57.493
- Uh-huh. You tell it!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.286
- Whoo!

17:59.411 --> 18:00.537
- Rowdy crowd.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.498
Just remember, Peggy, you came here

18:02.498 --> 18:03.832
'cause you have something to say

18:03.957 --> 18:05.334
and it might be complex.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.002
Turtles are complex, yes, they are.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.712
But when you say something from the heart

18:08.796 --> 18:10.047
it always comes out right.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.716
- That was quotably quoted, my friend.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.176
Quotably quoted.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.511
- Whoo!

18:19.890 --> 18:20.724
Hi, mom.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.810
Bobby. Honey, what are you doing here?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.938
Well, we figured today
was your special day.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.857
And since you're singing a special song

18:29.191 --> 18:32.236
we thought you should have
a special guitar to play it on.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.737
Betsy!

18:39.326 --> 18:42.204
Hey, I want you to give a lot of
support to our next artist.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.831
Peggy Hill, everybody.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.959
Whoo! We're behind you.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.628
Peggy's here to sing a song
about how a woman feels

18:49.628 --> 18:52.089
when the world tells her
who she has to be.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.090
Huh?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.925
Oh, no. Actually, I'm singing the one

18:54.925 --> 18:56.677
about the turtle
that's stuck in her shell.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.932
And I'd like to dedicate this
to my husband.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.893
She's kidding, right?

19:46.560 --> 19:47.895
AUDIENCE 3: Leave him.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.938
AUDIENCE 4: Fight corporate white
male oppression.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.649
I thought the song was
just about a turtle, dad.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.526
Yeah. I did, too.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.279
- Men are pervert.
- Um, I'm... I'm sorry. I...

19:57.738 --> 19:59.406
I'm just a little bit flustered.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.033
AUDIENCE 1: Wake up, girl.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.409
AUDIENCE 2: Speak your mind.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.077
AUDIENCE 3: Look what he's doing to you.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.871
AUDIENCE 4: I got a number you can call.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.039

20:36.485 --> 20:37.736
Oh, man.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.280
Kind of copped out
at the end there, didn't she?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.951
Now that gal can write music.

20:46.870 --> 20:47.996
<i>Maybe the problem is</i>

20:48.080 --> 20:49.831
<i>you've got too much mother in you.</i>

20:49.915 --> 20:50.874
<i>Oh, go on.</i>

20:50.958 --> 20:53.835
One kid was plenty for my mom
but you're different.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.964
If you're not
nurturing 20, 30 kids at once

20:57.256 --> 20:58.465
you start to lose your edge

20:58.465 --> 21:00.425
and how's that good for the boy?

21:00.634 --> 21:03.136
Well, maybe I could try teaching again.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.763
Sure. And in the meantime,

21:04.763 --> 21:06.974
we can keep Bobby on the medicine.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.477
I'll tell you today, I really noticed
his behavior improve.

21:10.727 --> 21:14.231
Uh, I didn't take my medicine today.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.941
- What?
- Why not, honey?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.694
'Cause Luanne needed it... badly.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.488
And anyway, I can't take the rush anymore.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.824
It's too fast and, like, freezy.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.575
You know, it's, like...

21:30.289 --> 21:32.499
Welcome home. I cooked you
brunch and I tuned your car.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.251
I fixed your mower and I ate the brunch.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.335
Hmm.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.255
Maybe we should read a little more
about that medicine, Hank.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.173
Yeah. Couldn't hurt.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.556
<i>And there it goes.</i>
