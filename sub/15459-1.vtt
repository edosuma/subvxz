02:16.783 --> 02:17.647
Luke!!!

03:05.832 --> 03:06.491
Luke!

03:06.666 --> 03:07.655
Luke!!!

03:25.085 --> 03:25.949
Luke!!

03:26.853 --> 03:28.718
Luke!!!

03:32.225 --> 03:33.192
A werewolf!

04:11.998 --> 04:12.965
An aristocrat!

08:07.801 --> 08:09.393
You must be a wandering hunter?!

08:14.040 --> 08:15.837
You can talk, can't you?

08:21.981 --> 08:23.846
Is that sword just for show?

08:24.017 --> 08:25.678
Can I take it?

08:33.559 --> 08:34.549
Good defense!

08:50.243 --> 08:51.642
You're not as good as I thought!!

08:52.312 --> 08:55.076
Now, leave the sword
you have on your back and go!

09:11.664 --> 09:15.156
Wait! You're a hunter just like
I thought, and...you must be...

09:15.401 --> 09:17.096
...a vampire hunter!!

09:18.137 --> 09:22.369
Am I right? I'm sorry.
I apologize for my rudeness.

09:22.642 --> 09:24.269
I wanted to test your skill.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.571
I...I will hire you!!

09:30.350 --> 09:32.011
I need you!!

09:34.220 --> 09:35.482
L...Look at this!

09:36.823 --> 09:38.688
The kiss mark from a Count.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.440
What is your name?

09:58.578 --> 10:01.672
Doris Ran.
Can you take this job?

10:02.749 --> 10:04.182
I will pay you any reward.

10:05.518 --> 10:07.213
T. ..three meals a day, and...

10:07.553 --> 10:10.886
you can sleep with me too.

10:11.391 --> 10:13.086
When did the Count attack you?

10:13.259 --> 10:14.658
Are you taking my offer?!

10:54.701 --> 10:55.326
Damn!

10:59.439 --> 11:00.235
Sister!

11:00.907 --> 11:01.703
Dan!

11:10.350 --> 11:11.874
I'll board itfor you.

11:13.086 --> 11:16.180
Wow!
This is a DL4 model cyborg horse!

11:17.657 --> 11:19.852
Hey you don't talk much, do you?

11:20.326 --> 11:24.353
Dr. Felingo said
there are 2 types of quiet men.

11:24.497 --> 11:26.658
Those who are always thinking
about something bad, and...

11:27.300 --> 11:31.168
those with experience,
who don't say unnecessary things.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.768
I think you are the second one.

11:37.810 --> 11:39.300
Because you look really cool!

12:35.568 --> 12:37.160
Hey, Doris!

12:37.904 --> 12:38.996
Greco...

12:40.073 --> 12:42.541
I guess the rumors are true.

12:43.743 --> 12:44.835
W...what are you talking about?

12:46.145 --> 12:49.273
Well I want to talk to you about that.

13:01.227 --> 13:02.251
What do you want to talk about?

13:02.295 --> 13:06.732
Let's see...the story that
you were attacked by the Count.

13:06.766 --> 13:08.131
I don't know what do you mean!

13:08.434 --> 13:11.130
Hey, hey, don't raise your voice.

13:11.504 --> 13:14.234
Don't you care if your
brother hears about that?

13:15.641 --> 13:20.169
Well, Doris, why didn't
you tell me about this?

13:20.847 --> 13:22.974
I'm the Mayor's son in this village.

13:23.382 --> 13:26.943
I can hire as many
hunters as you want.

13:26.986 --> 13:28.544
Much better than the one you hired.

13:28.921 --> 13:29.910
How's that?

13:30.123 --> 13:32.284
I will even forget
about what you did to me.

13:32.325 --> 13:34.259
So why don't
you just do what I say.

13:37.697 --> 13:39.358
W...what the hell?!
That hurts... !

13:39.866 --> 13:41.333
Don't get fresh with me!

13:42.368 --> 13:48.796
Doris, I'm worried about you.
I'm trying to help you.

13:48.975 --> 13:51.808
Don't even think you
can demand my gratitude!

13:52.044 --> 13:55.673
I know so many people who've had
awful experiences with you!

13:57.350 --> 13:58.874
You're cute when you're angry...

13:58.918 --> 14:00.886
but totally unruly.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.478
Now be mature and do as I say.

14:03.789 --> 14:06.451
You bitch!
Don't think that I'm so easy!

14:23.976 --> 14:24.670
B...Boss...

14:24.844 --> 14:29.281
Hey, everybody! Listen to this!
Doris was attacked by the Count!

14:29.315 --> 14:31.215
The vampire bit her!

14:31.851 --> 14:34.081
That's why she hired the hunter!

14:46.165 --> 14:47.223
Sister!!

15:00.913 --> 15:02.938
Then you are a hunter?

15:04.750 --> 15:05.273
Yes.

15:08.221 --> 15:09.245
Doris...you...?

15:12.992 --> 15:13.959
Sister...

15:15.394 --> 15:17.225
I knew I was right.

15:17.530 --> 15:19.760
No! My sister was never
attacked by the Count.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.790
Loser!
Just because she turned you down.

15:22.235 --> 15:23.395
W...w...what?!

15:24.003 --> 15:25.027
You little brat!

15:25.504 --> 15:25.993
Greco!

15:26.038 --> 15:26.936
But, father!

15:27.006 --> 15:28.997
They're making a fool out of me!

15:29.208 --> 15:31.267
We are talking about an important
issue in the village right now.

15:31.377 --> 15:32.435
Go some place else!

15:32.612 --> 15:33.442
Damn!!

15:33.946 --> 15:37.143
Anyway, we can't let you loose
since you were bitten by the vampire.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.081
I have to send you to the asylum.

15:40.186 --> 15:40.982
Sheriff!

15:42.788 --> 15:43.652
Stop it!

15:43.756 --> 15:45.417
I won't let you take
my sister anywhere!

15:45.858 --> 15:47.416
Wait a minute, Sheriff.

15:47.693 --> 15:50.093
That asylum is no place
for humans to live.

15:50.296 --> 15:53.993
That place is worse than a pigsty.
As a doctor, I absolutely object!

15:54.400 --> 15:57.267
Besides, that place has been
abandoned for more than 50 years.

15:57.970 --> 16:00.530
I can't make any exceptions, Doctor.
It's the law of this village.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.434
Roman, don't you
remember what happened ...

16:03.542 --> 16:06.340
when we used
that place 50 years ago?

16:07.980 --> 16:09.971
What happened 50 years ago?

16:10.716 --> 16:14.083
There was a woman who was
attacked by a Count, like Doris.

16:14.186 --> 16:17.485
We locked her in the asylum,
but it evoked the Count's rage...

16:17.590 --> 16:19.581
and 30 villagers were
brutally murdered.

16:24.597 --> 16:26.326
What happened to that woman?

16:28.367 --> 16:30.460
She became insane
and died in the asylum.

16:32.905 --> 16:36.636
Can you hold off Doris' punishment
until I finish my assignment?

16:38.277 --> 16:39.073
What?

16:39.945 --> 16:43.278
Y...you look very confident
but...you must deal with vampires.

16:43.616 --> 16:44.878
If you fail...

16:46.185 --> 16:48.983
If he fails, I will kill myself!

16:49.588 --> 16:50.555
Sister!

17:04.704 --> 17:06.171
Dan, listen to me carefully.

17:09.575 --> 17:10.541
Welcome...

17:10.843 --> 17:13.811
Can I have one month's
worth of fertilizer,...

17:13.945 --> 17:17.507
and five packs of dried meat,
also some can foods?

17:18.550 --> 17:20.415
Sorry, but all are sold out.

17:21.686 --> 17:22.744
Mr. Weitory!

17:23.622 --> 17:27.683
Weitory! What're you talking about?
You have plenty of stock here.

17:27.859 --> 17:30.795
Doctor! All my other
customers have run away.

17:31.097 --> 17:33.497
I can't sell anything to
the friends of a vampire!

17:34.934 --> 17:35.764
What?!

17:37.403 --> 17:39.394
Things will be
harder from now on.

17:40.139 --> 17:44.132
Dan, you can cry as
much as you want...

17:45.144 --> 17:47.135
but, don't ever
let your sister cry.

17:47.646 --> 17:49.614
If you think your tears
will make your sister cry...

17:49.682 --> 17:51.547
then you should hold them back.

17:52.351 --> 17:55.343
No matter how difficult, you should
smile and encourage your sister.

17:56.322 --> 17:57.812
You have to be a man now.

17:58.891 --> 17:59.880
Do you understand?

18:53.546 --> 18:56.481
What is the matter with you today?
You're acting strangely.

18:57.583 --> 19:01.041
Protecting the girl,
and encouraging her brother...

19:01.987 --> 19:03.579
I don't know what's got into you.

19:03.889 --> 19:06.517
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with that girl.

19:08.194 --> 19:09.286
Don't be silly!

19:10.496 --> 19:11.554
That's it, isn't it?

19:11.664 --> 19:15.760
Although she offered you her body,
I don't think that's what you want.

19:15.968 --> 19:17.959
Your only interest
has been hunting aristocrats.

19:18.771 --> 19:22.639
A bloody life,
that's been your destiny.

19:23.042 --> 19:25.203
Perhaps now, you long for
the love of a human being?

19:25.344 --> 19:27.869
It can never be...
a man like you...

19:28.881 --> 19:29.711
Oops...

19:30.015 --> 19:33.280
Thank you for this afternoon.
You must have told Dan something?

19:33.586 --> 19:35.577
He keeps trying to encourage me.

19:37.857 --> 19:40.792
My father was a hunter too,
a Werewolf hunter.

19:41.427 --> 19:44.055
But he didn't know
anything about aristocrats.

19:44.330 --> 19:46.423
"You should only ask
vampire hunters about aristocrats."

19:46.732 --> 19:48.563
"The other hunters
have no knowledge of them. "

19:49.168 --> 19:51.159
My father always said that.

19:51.837 --> 19:54.101
D, please tell me more about them.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.132
Tomorrow is the "Moon of Woman".

19:56.675 --> 19:57.903
"Moon of Woman"?

19:58.010 --> 20:00.205
Is that when the red moon
comes out once every month?

20:00.246 --> 20:02.180
Aristocrats detest biting for blood
on that night...

20:02.214 --> 20:04.273
because they believe this moon
causes the flow of impure blood.

20:04.350 --> 20:07.683
This means some messenger from the
castle may come tonight to take you.

20:08.187 --> 20:09.984
Who is the Count that lives there?

20:10.155 --> 20:11.622
His name is Count Lee.

20:11.724 --> 20:14.659
He's been ruling this land
long before our village established.

20:15.027 --> 20:17.018
He had disappeared
for a long time, but...

20:17.663 --> 20:21.326
his castle lit up two years ago,
and we realized he had come back.

20:21.867 --> 20:25.268
He supposed be five thousand
to ten thousand years old.

20:25.404 --> 20:28.498
He must be incredibly old anyway.

20:32.244 --> 20:35.236
Ten thousand years old...
he could be a difficult enemy.

21:15.421 --> 21:16.479
Here they come.

21:20.492 --> 21:22.790
How do you want to fight?
I'll fight with you.

21:23.963 --> 21:26.932
You can't beat them
with a cross or garlic.

21:27.600 --> 21:32.537
They keep mutants and werewolves
for fighting.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.547
I guess you hired a bodyguard.

22:24.490 --> 22:26.981
A cheap idea that only
low class humans would think of.

22:27.326 --> 22:30.056
A woman...?
What happened to the Count?

22:32.064 --> 22:35.864
My father told me that this girl
is unusually beautiful,...

22:36.502 --> 22:39.767
for a human in this village, and her
blood is extremely tasty and mild.

22:39.872 --> 22:41.499
So I came to look at her.

22:42.207 --> 22:44.675
But she is a fool and not
worthy of our clan.

22:44.810 --> 22:47.836
She forgets that we are the rulers
by acting against us impertinently.

22:47.913 --> 22:49.244
It can not be forgiven!

22:49.682 --> 22:51.616
I will kill you in the
bloodiest way first...

22:51.750 --> 22:54.241
and then destroy this girl slowly.

22:55.721 --> 22:56.745
As you wish.

22:57.356 --> 22:58.983
I'm Ray Ginsay.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.987
My job is to destroy humans like you.

23:02.161 --> 23:03.458
Prepare to die!

23:30.989 --> 23:32.980
You are much more than I expected.

23:33.225 --> 23:35.489
Then I will have to be more serious too.

24:11.196 --> 24:12.458
Uh...I see...

24:12.598 --> 24:15.533
I've heard about a mutant
who can warp space...

24:16.401 --> 24:17.459
Is that you?

24:20.806 --> 24:24.173
Too bad for you!
Now, I will take your head.

24:29.948 --> 24:31.381
Y...you bastard!

24:35.521 --> 24:36.317
Well.

24:36.555 --> 24:38.546
This man is a dampiel.

24:41.593 --> 24:43.390
Ray, I will take care of him.

24:43.529 --> 24:44.587
But...Countess...

24:44.763 --> 24:45.491
Get back!

24:48.500 --> 24:50.900
I understand...Countess...

24:52.004 --> 24:54.666
A dampiel?
This is the first time I've met one.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.831
Some Count must've had fun.

24:56.975 --> 24:59.569
You are the evil consequence of
a low class woman and a Count!

24:59.678 --> 25:01.441
You are worse than human!

25:01.914 --> 25:05.315
Girl, my business is with the Count.

25:06.518 --> 25:08.315
I don't want to have to kill you.

25:09.388 --> 25:12.687
Shut up! You, a dampiel,
think you can beat me?!

25:23.535 --> 25:26.231
Go back to the castle,
and tell the Count...

25:26.471 --> 25:30.066
the destiny of a transient visitor
is going back to the darkness.

25:30.709 --> 25:32.267
A transient visitor?

25:49.695 --> 25:51.686
Have Ramica and the others returned?

25:54.066 --> 25:57.092
They took action selfishly,
without asking my permission...

25:57.736 --> 25:59.966
I will think about
their punishment later.

26:01.273 --> 26:02.797
What...a Dampiel?

26:03.141 --> 26:06.577
You say Ramica and Ray
were forced to retreat by a Dampiel?

26:08.614 --> 26:12.880
Interesting,
one more thing for my enjoyment.

26:18.123 --> 26:20.023
Ancestor God, Count Dracula!

26:20.659 --> 26:22.456
My father is wrong.

26:23.061 --> 26:28.021
He is trying to invite a low class
girl into our noble Lee family.

26:28.667 --> 26:31.431
I can't let him foolishly...

26:31.570 --> 26:34.198
I can't let him foolishly...

26:39.077 --> 26:41.545
Lady Ramica,
please go back to your room.

26:41.747 --> 26:44.113
I have no reason
to listen to your orders.

26:44.449 --> 26:47.282
The Count scolded me
for what we did tonight.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.317
He ordered that you
should not leave your room.

26:51.623 --> 26:53.056
Now, come with me.

26:54.259 --> 26:54.953
Ray!

26:55.460 --> 26:56.950
Don't ever touch me again!

26:57.162 --> 26:59.630
Well, you seem to be
ingratiating yourself with my father...

26:59.665 --> 27:00.927
to join the Count's family.

27:01.099 --> 27:03.090
But you can't change
your low class identity.

27:03.969 --> 27:06.665
A person who has
such disgusting blood...

27:06.772 --> 27:09.468
should neverjoin our family.
I will never let that happen!

29:46.064 --> 29:48.931
D, watch out...it's a trap!

29:49.468 --> 29:50.492
I know.

30:12.257 --> 30:13.417
A phantom beast!

30:21.366 --> 30:22.594
Over there?!

30:49.127 --> 30:50.685
We meet again.

30:52.264 --> 30:57.361
Well, you dodged my Jagar boy,
and you still have an arm.

30:57.836 --> 31:00.430
You truly are a dampiel.

31:07.345 --> 31:11.076
I want to continue the fight
from yesterday, right now.

31:11.216 --> 31:15.175
But I have to guide you
somewhere by the Count's order.

32:02.567 --> 32:04.558
I told you this was a trap.

32:05.403 --> 32:09.669
This is the aftermath of a war
that took place ten thousand years ago.

32:09.774 --> 32:12.242
This is a really
telling view of that world.

33:46.271 --> 33:47.636
Who are you?

33:48.239 --> 33:49.672
Who are you?

33:52.777 --> 33:54.267
Why don't you answer?

33:54.679 --> 33:56.146
Why don't you answer?

33:57.048 --> 33:58.276
Who are you three?

33:58.516 --> 33:59.574
We are...

34:00.552 --> 34:01.849
We are...

34:04.556 --> 34:06.421
This kind!

34:21.539 --> 34:23.029
Y...you!

34:30.547 --> 34:33.676
We are the famous
Snake Women of Midwitch!

34:34.719 --> 34:37.449
Big sister, we haven't had
fresh prey for a long time.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.581
Let's enjoy sucking this man's energy.

34:39.858 --> 34:43.385
Sure! We'll all take his life energy,
down to the marrow in his bones.

35:01.946 --> 35:08.249
Doris, don't worry. He'll come back.
He looked like a man made from steel.

35:08.753 --> 35:10.380
He won't die so easily.

35:11.089 --> 35:13.421
Doris...are you in love with him?!

35:17.028 --> 35:18.359
That's not a good idea!

35:18.463 --> 35:20.727
He is not the kind
of man you think he is.

35:21.099 --> 35:23.795
He may not be a bad person,
but he has dangerous eyes.

35:25.270 --> 35:26.430
Dangerous eyes?

35:26.538 --> 35:29.996
Eyes that went through
so many dangerous battles.

35:30.675 --> 35:33.269
He is not the kind of
man who will accept you.

36:02.273 --> 36:05.299
Well, lady, the Count
has been waiting for you.

36:06.945 --> 36:08.936
Let Dan and Dr. Felingo go!!

36:09.347 --> 36:12.646
Too bad!
Fresh meat is their favorite!

36:16.020 --> 36:18.682
I...if you do that,
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

36:19.991 --> 36:23.154
The Count ordered me
to bring you without injury.

36:23.761 --> 36:25.319
I guess I have no choice.

36:25.730 --> 36:28.722
Put your tongue back inside
your mouth. It's bad manners.

36:35.573 --> 36:40.203
Well Doris, tomorrow, you can
finally join an aristocrat's family.

36:40.311 --> 36:42.711
So why don't you stop bluffing?

36:43.715 --> 36:44.511
You'll see!

36:44.682 --> 36:47.845
I will get out from this
musty castle tonight!

36:49.020 --> 36:53.047
You are cute.
You will become my wife soon...

36:53.157 --> 36:56.422
so I will forgive your impudence,
for now.

36:57.095 --> 37:02.032
By the way, Doris, you seem to
think that hunter will rescue you.

37:15.880 --> 37:16.847
D!!

37:17.916 --> 37:21.408
Those snake women are
sucking out all his energy.

37:21.553 --> 37:23.817
Look at them.
They are in the height of pleasure.

37:24.322 --> 37:26.847
They have been intoxicated
by his worthless pleasure...

37:26.925 --> 37:28.358
for more than halfthe day.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.388
A normal man would
have died in five minutes.

37:31.429 --> 37:33.124
But it's no wonder,
since he is a dampiel

37:34.599 --> 37:35.657
Dampiel?!

37:36.401 --> 37:37.800
Are you saying D is a dampiel?

37:38.403 --> 37:40.371
Oh, didn't you know that?

37:40.772 --> 37:44.037
Our aristocrats have slept with
lower class women for fun.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.869
He was born of mixed blood.

37:46.244 --> 37:46.676
What's wrong?

37:47.412 --> 37:50.677
Doris, look at them well.
Don't you think it's exciting?

37:51.182 --> 37:53.013
No! Stop it!

37:53.818 --> 37:57.447
All right! You better go to your
bedroom and rest well tonight.

38:04.095 --> 38:07.064
Tomorrow is our wedding...
my dear Doris...

38:07.231 --> 38:09.995
Tonight it seems that
even the moon is jealous of me.

38:25.116 --> 38:29.416
What kind of man is he?
He is overwhelming us.

38:29.954 --> 38:32.582
Really overwhelming us.

38:44.969 --> 38:46.630
Oh no?! He's...?!

39:08.559 --> 39:11.221
Is my father trying to invite
this woman into the Lee family?

39:12.163 --> 39:14.654
This woman will
become my mother?

39:32.617 --> 39:34.414
Like father, like son...

39:34.519 --> 39:38.387
No matter how much you reject it,
you'll bare your fangs anyway.

39:38.523 --> 39:39.455
Shut up.

39:39.824 --> 39:42.258
Are you angry again?
This is your destiny.

39:42.293 --> 39:44.284
There is nothing you
can do about it.

39:44.362 --> 39:46.956
Damn you!
Do you want me to cut you off?

39:47.031 --> 39:48.999
All right...I won't talk anymore.

39:51.836 --> 39:54.361
What part of her is
my father so attracted to?

39:55.039 --> 39:59.840
I'll never let you join the Lee family.
I, Ramica, will never accept it!

40:03.881 --> 40:04.347
Bastard?!

41:53.324 --> 41:55.417
Gorem!

42:45.042 --> 42:46.339
Gorem!

43:05.696 --> 43:06.560
I've got you!

43:17.742 --> 43:18.766
Gimlet!

43:24.749 --> 43:27.877
I can't go back into the
castle, until I kill him.

43:38.529 --> 43:39.257
Sister.

43:39.764 --> 43:40.423
Sister!

43:43.167 --> 43:44.998
D...Dan. Where is D?

43:45.903 --> 43:48.599
He is fixing the wall outside.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.032
By the way,
I think he's really strong.

43:51.509 --> 43:55.570
He rescued you all by himself
from such a horrible place.

43:56.414 --> 44:00.043
Besides, he didn't even
rest after he came back.

44:00.151 --> 44:02.779
He started working
to fix the wall, right away.

44:04.288 --> 44:05.255
It's the aristocrat!

44:05.756 --> 44:06.848
It's the aristocrat's carriage!

44:06.924 --> 44:08.050
Why are they here?

44:11.629 --> 44:12.823
What is wrong with you?

44:12.964 --> 44:15.728
Let's go inside
the hotel and drink more.

44:16.500 --> 44:17.762
You go home now!

44:18.669 --> 44:19.727
What's going on?

44:23.541 --> 44:24.530
Hey, old man!

44:24.742 --> 44:26.676
A messenger
from the aristocrat is here.

44:26.911 --> 44:29.505
I know! Give me
the key to the monitor room!

44:31.482 --> 44:34.042
The Count has sent me.

44:34.852 --> 44:38.344
What do you want?
Did he tell you to execute me?

44:39.156 --> 44:44.822
No, that's absurd. You think
I can beat you with my skill?

44:45.162 --> 44:51.362
Impudence is rewarded with death.
That's the law to protect the castle.

44:57.308 --> 45:01.768
The Count wants
you to use this to kill him.

45:03.547 --> 45:06.277
Could this be
the Incense of Time Trap.

45:06.784 --> 45:08.752
Indeed.

45:10.888 --> 45:12.446
Incense of Time Trap?

45:27.204 --> 45:28.466
D!! Did you find Dan?

45:28.939 --> 45:30.372
Dan was kidnapped.

45:30.708 --> 45:31.697
That's Dan's gun!

45:32.043 --> 45:35.206
I'm the one they want to take.
Why did they take my brother?

45:35.880 --> 45:37.711
What does it say?
Let me see!

45:38.015 --> 45:38.709
What is this?!

45:39.216 --> 45:44.153
Don't bother. This is a language
only understood between assassins.

45:44.588 --> 45:47.853
It says, if I want to save Dan's life,
I have to go over there by myself.

45:48.526 --> 45:51.017
They are trying to separate us.

45:51.562 --> 45:54.554
Why Dan?
Why notjust tell me to go over there?

45:55.132 --> 45:58.829
Because, the person who wrote this
letter wants to conclude the battle.

45:59.036 --> 46:04.474
And if he used the boy to get you, it
would stain the aristocrat's honor.

46:05.176 --> 46:06.939
Screw the aristocrat's honor!

46:07.011 --> 46:09.912
Aristocrats are all
monsters who suck human blood.

46:12.783 --> 46:13.772
I...I'm sorry.

46:14.085 --> 46:18.647
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you know I'm a dampiel?

46:19.090 --> 46:22.059
My blood is mixed with
the aristocrats whom you hate.

46:22.860 --> 46:24.327
I understand.

46:24.428 --> 46:27.920
You didn't tell us because you
didn't want us to worry unnecessarily.

46:28.699 --> 46:30.667
It's better that I didn't know.

46:38.309 --> 46:39.401
You made it.

46:39.610 --> 46:40.634
What did you do with Dan?

46:42.613 --> 46:44.205
Brother D!

46:44.548 --> 46:46.209
Help me!!!

46:48.219 --> 46:51.313
Little boy! I will get you down
after I kill this man.

46:51.522 --> 46:53.114
Why don't you be quiet and wait there.

46:55.626 --> 46:58.823
Brother D, I'm scared!!!

46:58.963 --> 46:59.657
You bastard!

47:00.564 --> 47:01.895
Now, let's begin.

47:19.150 --> 47:21.584
D Watch out! This smells of
the Incense of Time Trap.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.344
It...it wont light!

47:35.399 --> 47:38.698
Dan, Dan, please come back safe.

47:39.303 --> 47:40.736
If you die...

47:41.105 --> 47:43.300
Doris, it's me. Felingo!

47:43.407 --> 47:44.339
Doctor!!

47:44.475 --> 47:46.204
Doris, can you turn off
the switch for the barrier.

47:46.677 --> 47:47.701
Doctor!!

47:48.612 --> 47:51.513
Doctor, Doctor!
Dan was...Dan was...

47:51.615 --> 47:53.242
I had to take care of
an emergency patient.

47:53.517 --> 47:57.146
I'm sorry for being late.
Come with me right now.

47:58.055 --> 48:01.422
I don't know why you and Dan
have to go through this difficulty.

48:03.194 --> 48:06.561
My hand!
Somebody cheated me!

48:06.630 --> 48:09.531
You've got fake incense.
You must have been set up.

48:09.567 --> 48:12.331
Now throw away your
worthless ambition.

48:12.937 --> 48:15.804
Bastard!
You'll never understand my feelings!

48:20.244 --> 48:22.712
Doctor, is there really such a place?

48:22.880 --> 48:24.871
I found it in the Northern forest.

48:24.949 --> 48:28.316
I passed it when I was on my
way back from Mr. Parker's.

48:28.452 --> 48:31.615
It's an ancient building with
some engravings on it's walls.

48:31.689 --> 48:35.955
Later, I found out it's a building
that blocks the power of vampires.

48:36.527 --> 48:41.760
We'll be safe there
and that man will rescue Dan.

48:42.066 --> 48:42.760
You're right!

48:53.744 --> 48:54.904
The Count's daughter!

48:54.979 --> 48:56.674
Whoa, whoa!

48:56.981 --> 48:58.380
Doris, turn us around!

48:58.482 --> 48:59.380
There's no room here!

48:59.483 --> 49:00.973
I'll take care of her!

49:06.890 --> 49:08.084
Doctor!! Dr. Felingo!!

49:10.094 --> 49:11.026
That was...

49:11.161 --> 49:12.059
my name...

49:12.096 --> 49:13.654
until yesterday!

49:14.632 --> 49:16.532
Doctor! Doctor!! No!!!

49:18.469 --> 49:20.767
No...Doctor...
not you too?

49:22.239 --> 49:22.967
Hey!

49:23.507 --> 49:25.475
Lady Ramica, why are you here?

49:26.410 --> 49:29.470
The Count's plan was for me
to take her to the castle.

49:29.780 --> 49:30.974
Get her down.

49:31.181 --> 49:31.772
Yes.

49:33.817 --> 49:37.617
I have always thought
of this girl as my daughter.

49:38.155 --> 49:39.884
But seeing her now,
she is really beautiful...

49:39.957 --> 49:41.788
and I wonder why
I never raped her.

49:42.726 --> 49:44.751
The Count really has good taste.

49:45.963 --> 49:50.798
In truth, I want to ask the Count
to share her leftover blood with me.

49:51.935 --> 49:53.232
Hey, cretin!

49:56.040 --> 49:57.098
Doctor!!

49:58.509 --> 49:59.601
D...Doris?

50:01.512 --> 50:02.570
D...Doctor!!

50:07.318 --> 50:08.342
Doctor...

50:09.353 --> 50:12.618
This is hopeless!
He and Dan might be already...

50:12.923 --> 50:15.790
He...you mean that dampiel?

50:16.694 --> 50:20.460
I would rather die than
become an aristocrat.

50:20.864 --> 50:22.729
Everything is my father's fault.

50:23.534 --> 50:26.901
This is pointless. Just go
where my father can't find you.

50:44.855 --> 50:45.787
You?!

50:58.068 --> 50:59.194
Greco?!

50:59.536 --> 51:00.764
It really works...

51:01.038 --> 51:03.131
this Incense of Time Trap.

51:04.441 --> 51:08.639
It's supposed to blind vampires,
but it really makes them suffer.

51:08.979 --> 51:10.537
What are you doing with that thing?

51:11.014 --> 51:13.812
What's important is we have
the Count's daughter as our hostage.

51:14.385 --> 51:17.354
Everything will be fine if we
can make a deal with the Count.

51:17.821 --> 51:18.879
Your planning to...

51:18.956 --> 51:21.550
lure the Count out, and take his life.

51:21.925 --> 51:24.155
This Incense of Time Trap
will do the job easily.

51:24.428 --> 51:27.363
But I have one condition.
You must promise to marry me.

51:27.798 --> 51:28.594
Greco...?!

51:28.999 --> 51:31.058
If you say no,
I'll just leave now.

51:31.201 --> 51:33.431
If you marry me,
we can get the Count's treasure...

51:33.470 --> 51:35.062
and control the village, too.

51:35.372 --> 51:36.771
Stop it! It hurt my eyes.

51:37.408 --> 51:39.103
You don't look so well, Doris?

51:39.576 --> 51:42.636
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you from now on.

51:43.647 --> 51:47.105
Well, she's good looking when
I see her face close up.

51:47.785 --> 51:50.618
I thought vampire girls
looked like monsters.

51:50.954 --> 51:52.945
Kill me! Right here...right now!

51:54.958 --> 51:57.358
You still have strength to be snooty?

51:57.528 --> 52:02.363
Kill me now! I'd rather die than be
captured by lowly creatures like you!

52:03.600 --> 52:05.090
What? You little brat!

52:05.235 --> 52:08.693
Kill me! If you don't kill me now,
I will surely kill you later!

52:08.872 --> 52:10.533
All right! I will give you death!

52:10.641 --> 52:13.508
Even if I kill you,
I can still lure the Count out!

52:13.911 --> 52:15.902
Stop doing that!
She can't even fight back!!

52:16.113 --> 52:17.512
She said I'm a lowly creature!

52:17.948 --> 52:18.710
Doris!?

52:24.288 --> 52:25.186
Sister!

52:26.623 --> 52:28.090
Dan? Is that you?

52:28.592 --> 52:29.786
Sister, are you all right?

52:29.827 --> 52:31.692
Dan, you're still alive!

52:31.795 --> 52:32.591
Dan!

52:37.501 --> 52:39.162
I see.
The Doctor...

52:39.970 --> 52:41.961
I thought you were dead.

52:42.506 --> 52:44.303
I didn't care if I died, too.

52:44.641 --> 52:46.632
Sister, you should be stronger!

52:47.077 --> 52:49.341
Brother D said we
should never give up!

52:49.480 --> 52:50.640
Dan...you are...

52:59.189 --> 53:01.487
Go back to your castle,
it's not far from here.

53:02.426 --> 53:03.791
You're not going to kill me?

53:05.028 --> 53:08.225
Of course not, why should we
act like cowards who kill women!

53:08.866 --> 53:10.925
I'll tell you why he is helping you.

53:11.301 --> 53:12.165
You see...

53:12.336 --> 53:16.670
he wouldn't allow anyone helpless
to be killed, even a vampire.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.032
I am notjust "anyone" in
the lower class. I'm an aristocrat.

53:21.445 --> 53:23.504
Love or feelings do
not exist in our world.

53:24.014 --> 53:27.450
The only rule in our world is that the
weak become the victims of the strong.

53:27.784 --> 53:29.684
Thus, the aristocrats
control the lowly humans.

53:30.220 --> 53:32.745
A world where the weak
become the victims of the strong...

53:33.357 --> 53:36.053
Your Ancient God
didn't teach such things.

53:39.062 --> 53:40.552
The Ancient God?

54:02.519 --> 54:04.077
D, would you like to take a shower?

54:04.788 --> 54:06.187
D ...D!

54:08.892 --> 54:09.756
D...

54:10.160 --> 54:11.024
What's wrong?

54:11.228 --> 54:12.456
I'm glad you are here.

54:12.963 --> 54:15.056
I was worried that you
might have left again.

54:15.966 --> 54:18.764
I'm sorry I said mean
things to you earlier.

54:19.469 --> 54:21.869
I don't mind.
I've gotten used to it already.

54:22.072 --> 54:24.063
I don't want you to
end up like my father.

54:24.608 --> 54:28.408
Just because of he was a hunter,
he was forced to fight with vampires.

54:29.212 --> 54:30.839
We've fought enough.

54:31.248 --> 54:33.478
Let's go some place
else together to live.

54:34.418 --> 54:35.544
I can't do that.

54:35.752 --> 54:36.548
Why?!

54:36.653 --> 54:38.621
You would be even
more unhappy, then you are now.

54:38.722 --> 54:40.121
That's not true!

54:40.324 --> 54:43.054
I ...I don't want you to die!

54:43.493 --> 54:44.221
Stop it!

54:44.294 --> 54:46.694
No! Let me stay
like this for a while.

55:19.129 --> 55:20.892
It's all right.
Take my blood.

55:36.780 --> 55:37.644
D.

55:38.915 --> 55:39.882
Forgive me...

55:41.918 --> 55:44.113
Why can't you be honest
with your feelings?

55:44.254 --> 55:47.417
Do you think every part of
yourself is cursed so badly?

55:48.492 --> 55:52.861
You can't even grant a woman's wish.
Why can't you even be a dampiel?

55:53.163 --> 55:54.721
Your father was...

55:54.865 --> 55:55.797
Shut up!

55:56.066 --> 55:57.158
Yeah, yeah...

56:02.439 --> 56:03.235
Damn!

56:03.907 --> 56:08.310
Well, at least I saved
this Incense of Time trap.

56:09.646 --> 56:11.079
It was you?!

56:12.049 --> 56:13.209
Wait a minute!

56:13.917 --> 56:16.351
I can't wait.
I have to kill you.

56:57.494 --> 56:58.552
You bastard!

57:14.511 --> 57:18.345
I'm sorry, since you were kind
enough to let me go free last time.

57:22.886 --> 57:24.012
Bastard!

57:24.521 --> 57:26.785
Oh, you're really strong!
How is this?

57:53.683 --> 57:55.674
Aristocrat,
eternal youth...

58:20.610 --> 58:22.100
What kind of a man is he?

58:36.426 --> 58:38.087
Now we are even.

58:40.697 --> 58:41.356
D!

58:41.464 --> 58:43.193
D! Are you still alive?!

58:43.466 --> 58:44.160
D!

58:44.367 --> 58:49.464
Brother, brother, wake up!
Open your eyes!

58:50.106 --> 58:51.198
D!

58:54.244 --> 58:57.111
Is he...dead?

59:38.188 --> 59:41.180
You really are a stubborn girl.

59:42.125 --> 59:44.650
Father, this is my last request.

59:44.895 --> 59:46.886
Please cancel the wedding tonight.

59:47.197 --> 59:49.665
If you let that low
class girl into our family...

59:50.000 --> 59:52.468
Ramica, the wedding tonight...

59:52.535 --> 59:55.527
is only temporal
entertainment in my long life.

59:56.806 --> 59:59.297
I know I will get
bored of her someday.

59:59.976 --> 01:00:02.444
After that,
I will look for a new girl.

01:00:03.013 --> 01:00:05.004
I'm doing this solely for pleasure.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:08.478
Father, then I will kill her!

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:10.714
Otherwise,
the Lee family will collapse.

01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:13.018
Ramica, listen to me!

01:00:13.356 --> 01:00:16.848
The Lee family will not collapse
even if we invite a human girl...

01:00:18.028 --> 01:00:22.021
because Ramica, your own
mother was the same as that girl.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:25.292
She also came from
the lower class.

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:32.366
I have been living for
ten thousand years, in this world.

01:00:32.575 --> 01:00:35.009
I don't think you
understand what that means.

01:00:35.879 --> 01:00:38.746
Only boredom and
weariness surrounds me.

01:00:39.449 --> 01:00:41.917
The best medicine for that is
to have some enjoyment...

01:00:42.552 --> 01:00:45.282
with a lower class woman,
like your mother.

01:00:47.023 --> 01:00:52.484
Poor humans live their small
lives while aristocrats like us...

01:00:52.595 --> 01:00:54.893
rule their land.

01:00:56.566 --> 01:00:57.794
When you consider that...

01:00:57.867 --> 01:01:00.859
finding pleasure once every fifty to
a hundred years is not a big deal.

01:01:01.104 --> 01:01:03.698
Father, take your false story back!

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:06.141
It's not a false story.

01:01:06.209 --> 01:01:08.200
Your mother truly
belonged to lower class, but...

01:01:15.618 --> 01:01:20.681
Ramica, your high pride
is purely aristocratic.

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.589
However, I don't want you
to disturb my wedding.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.594
You should calm
yourself down for a while.

01:01:27.263 --> 01:01:28.389
Count...

01:01:29.132 --> 01:01:31.123
I ask you to do as you promised.

01:01:31.735 --> 01:01:32.861
Promise?

01:01:33.536 --> 01:01:36.903
Yes, to give me eternal youth
as a new member of the aristocracy.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:40.104
You idiot! You did
so much blundering this time.

01:01:40.176 --> 01:01:42.701
You should appreciate
that I've kept you alive.

01:01:43.446 --> 01:01:45.437
Forget about eternal youth?!

01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:47.706
Or wait for fifty years more.

01:01:51.521 --> 01:01:52.715
Fifty years?!

01:01:59.062 --> 01:02:02.293
Let's move.
He really gives me trouble.

01:02:09.739 --> 01:02:10.797
What?

01:02:21.484 --> 01:02:23.111
Oh, crap!
We have to hurry!

01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:07.353
Hey, what's the matter?
Can't you move?

01:03:09.766 --> 01:03:12.530
What's wrong D?
Wake up!

01:03:13.236 --> 01:03:15.067
This isn't funny.
They found us.

01:03:15.672 --> 01:03:19.870
Hey! What's wrong with you?
Move, move!

01:03:20.009 --> 01:03:21.704
Hey D?
What happened to you?

01:03:21.878 --> 01:03:23.869
Move! Move!

01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:25.708
Please move!
Move...move!

01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:29.382
Hey you! Move! Hey!
What are you doing?

01:03:39.262 --> 01:03:41.253
Oh well, I guess we made it.

01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:14.193
Sister.

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:27.740
Sister.

01:04:31.814 --> 01:04:32.781
Sister!!

01:05:11.888 --> 01:05:14.686
Ray, don't be rude.
Get out of our way.

01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:17.817
This is the end of your life.

01:05:29.906 --> 01:05:33.967
Wait for fifty years?
What do you think of our fifty years?!

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:37.968
I lost my left hand because of you,
and I had all my friends killed.

01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:41.948
I don't care anymore!
I will make sure you die here too!

01:05:48.725 --> 01:05:51.819
Did you actually think
that would work on me?

01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:06.808
So long Ray.

01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.907
What a fun day!

01:06:16.552 --> 01:06:21.751
It is rare for me, in my life,
to have such a satisfying day.

01:06:29.732 --> 01:06:40.904
We'd like to congratulate our Lord,
Count Magnus Lee, and his new wife.

01:06:41.311 --> 01:06:43.404
I appreciate everybody's blessing.

01:06:53.122 --> 01:06:56.580
You are the first woman
to give me such difficulty.

01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:14.535
It's you?!

01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:21.609
Vampires disappeared
for a long period of time.

01:07:22.318 --> 01:07:25.082
Vampires are only
transient visitors in this world.

01:07:25.888 --> 01:07:27.446
Transient visitors?

01:07:28.057 --> 01:07:31.220
Vampires, and this castle, are
merely ghosts forgotten by time.

01:07:31.728 --> 01:07:33.628
Go back to
the world where you belong!

01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:36.998
That's very funny.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.294
You are a dampiel, one who
was created out of our pleasure.

01:07:40.803 --> 01:07:43.067
Do you think you can beat me?

01:07:44.173 --> 01:07:46.801
I will have my fun
after taking care of you.

01:08:12.869 --> 01:08:14.427
You look so miserable!

01:08:14.637 --> 01:08:18.970
You are just a dampiel anyway.
I don't know why you hunt us...

01:08:19.509 --> 01:08:21.977
but there is no way you could
win against a pure vampire.

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:26.709
Well then, let me kill you
in a different way from Ray.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:36.356
I don't know how many
vampires you have killed ...

01:08:36.692 --> 01:08:39.388
but what you are doing
is killing your own people.

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:42.256
Why don't you kill
yourself by that sword.

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.901
Who the hell are you?!

01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:39.117
Sister!

01:09:39.255 --> 01:09:40.153
Stop!!

01:09:41.957 --> 01:09:42.754
Dan?

01:09:45.428 --> 01:09:47.191
Sister! Sister!

01:09:50.265 --> 01:09:54.532
Ra...Ramica, what are you doing?
Why don't you fight for me?!

01:09:55.204 --> 01:09:59.766
Father, enough is enough!
The Lee family will be destroyed.

01:10:00.009 --> 01:10:01.169
W...what?!

01:10:01.844 --> 01:10:05.940
Since you wanted her and
forgot the pride of aristocracy.

01:10:08.317 --> 01:10:09.443
R...ridiculous!

01:10:25.668 --> 01:10:26.896
A...are you?!

01:10:28.638 --> 01:10:29.764
M...maybe a prince...

01:10:30.039 --> 01:10:32.405
...the son of our ancient god?!

01:10:41.984 --> 01:10:47.718
D ...ancient god...I will be destroyed
with my father in this castle.

01:10:49.091 --> 01:10:50.922
I am not the Ancient God.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.488
I am an aristocrat.

01:10:52.628 --> 01:10:55.096
If our ancient god tells
us to be destroyed ...

01:10:55.197 --> 01:10:56.926
we should follow your word.

01:10:58.401 --> 01:11:00.869
I am just a dampiel, like you.

01:11:01.771 --> 01:11:03.705
You have human blood inside you.

01:11:04.173 --> 01:11:06.767
You can still live when you
take off the veil of an aristocrat.

01:11:07.143 --> 01:11:09.907
No...I am a pure aristocrat.

01:11:10.613 --> 01:11:12.604
I don't have any
low class blood inside me.

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:19.249
D!

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:20.747
Brother D!

01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:23.081
I...I am pure aristocrat!

01:14:13.162 --> 01:14:14.891
Brother, brother!

01:14:14.964 --> 01:14:15.692
D!

01:14:17.299 --> 01:14:18.561
Brother!

01:14:20.369 --> 01:14:21.597
Brother!

01:14:21.637 --> 01:14:22.501
D!

01:14:24.106 --> 01:14:25.232
Brother!

01:14:25.274 --> 01:14:26.104
D!!

01:14:28.377 --> 01:14:29.571
Brother!

01:14:29.645 --> 01:14:30.270
D!!!

01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:32.908
D!!!

01:14:32.948 --> 01:14:33.642
Brother!

01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:36.007
Brother!

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:37.378
D!!!

01:14:37.787 --> 01:14:38.947
Brother!

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:39.919
D!!!
