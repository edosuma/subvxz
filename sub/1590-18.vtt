awful lot of candy...

And shouldn't you be on
your way to pick up maud

01:44.672 --> 01:45.537
From the train station?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.272
But you've only tried
half of the flavors

01:47.274 --> 01:48.707
And we have to choose
the perfect ones

01:48.709 --> 01:52.144
Before she gets here
so I have time to make more.

01:52.146 --> 01:56.281
<i>(gobbling)</i>

01:56.283 --> 01:57.516
Maud is your sister;

01:57.518 --> 01:59.418
I'm sure she'll love
your rock candy.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.587
And I'm pretty sure
you've made enough.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.889
She's only staying
for the week.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.891
It's not just
for maud, silly.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.193
I'm making candy
for all of us.

02:08.195 --> 02:08.794
<i>(everyone groans)</i>

02:08.796 --> 02:12.197
It's part of a very important,
super-duper special tradition

02:12.199 --> 02:15.767
That only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.571
We're going to make rock
candy necklaces together.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.172
<i>(scream)</i>

02:20.174 --> 02:24.476
<i>It all started when maud and I</i>
<i>were fillies on the rock farm.</i>

02:24.478 --> 02:27.513
<i>She taught me the pie</i>
<i>family rock candy recipe.</i>

02:27.515 --> 02:29.581
<i>It has a secret ingredient.</i>

02:30.316 --> 02:31.683
<i>It's rocks.</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:34.219
<i>And she showed me how</i>
<i>to string the pieces</i>

02:34.221 --> 02:35.554
<i>To make them into a necklace.</i>

02:35.556 --> 02:38.657
<i>And once we were</i>
<i>done, we'd trade.</i>

02:40.393 --> 02:43.195
Maud and I have been trading
necklaces back and forth

02:43.197 --> 02:43.929
Since I moved to ponyville.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.266
They're a sign that we'll
always be best friends.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.902
Aw, what a great tradition.

02:49.904 --> 02:50.435
Hold on.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.272
The "secret
ingredient" is rocks?

02:53.274 --> 02:53.639
Yeah.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.942
But these are a special kind
of rock that maud discovered.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.311
What kind of a rock are they?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.679
I can't tell you that, silly.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.682
(exaggerated whisper)
it's a secret.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.386
Now that maud is heading off
to get her rocktorate

03:07.388 --> 03:07.886
In rock science,

03:07.888 --> 03:09.755
This may be our last
chance to trade them

03:09.757 --> 03:10.656
For a really long time.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.591
I can't wait for
you all to meet her.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.959
I just know that my best
ponyville friends

03:13.961 --> 03:17.496
And my best sister friend are
going to become bestest friends.

03:17.498 --> 03:21.600
We can make bestestest friend
rock candy necklaces together!

03:21.602 --> 03:23.835
She expresses herself through
fashion just like rarity.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.905
And she's really smart and loves
reading, just like twilight.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.374
And she's honest and
loves forest things

03:29.376 --> 03:31.810
And is good at games and...Well?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.712
She's awesome!

03:33.714 --> 03:35.547
She sounds amazing.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.481
But won't she start worrying

03:36.483 --> 03:39.718
If you aren't at the train
station when she gets here?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.986
She sure will.

03:41.487 --> 03:42.387
<i>(panicked gasp)</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:44.423
I gotta get out of here!

03:44.557 --> 03:45.924
<i>(crash)</i>

03:47.460 --> 03:48.727
<i>(engine hum)</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:50.462
<i>(dog barks)</i>

03:50.464 --> 03:52.264
I sure hope maud
has an appetite.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.600
Never met a pony, or a
critter, who didn't love

03:54.602 --> 03:56.602
Granny smith's
apple-spice muffins.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.769
Rarity: Oh! It's no use!

03:57.771 --> 04:02.007
I simply cannot find
anything suitable to wear.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.777
I doubt she'll notice
what anypony's wearing.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.712
So what's the big deal?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.781
The big deal is that it will be
very difficult to show maud

04:09.783 --> 04:12.818
What a strong fashion presence
we have in ponyville

04:12.820 --> 04:14.519
If the most fashion-forward
pony here

04:14.521 --> 04:17.489
Can't keep her hat
from falling apart.

04:17.491 --> 04:21.293
I think we're all a little
nervous about maud's visit.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.327
She's pinkie pie's sister

04:22.329 --> 04:25.397
And it's obvious pinkie really
wants us to hit it off.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.367
Being able to make those rock
candy necklaces together

04:28.369 --> 04:29.835
Is really important to her.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.803
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.705
<i>Pinkie pie: We're here.</i>

04:33.707 --> 04:38.343
<i>(boing boing)</i>

04:38.345 --> 04:39.411
Where's maud?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.812
She's coming.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.686
<i>Rainbow dash:</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

04:47.688 --> 04:48.754
She's not quite
as fast as me.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.791
I asked gummy to stay with
her in case she got lost.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.834
Is she even moving?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.939
We're over here, maud!

05:18.017 --> 05:19.685
<i>(sniff)</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:20.018
Hmm.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.454
(very laid back)
sedimentary.

05:23.089 --> 05:23.955
Huh?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.491
This is a sedimentary rock.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.496
That's really fascinating,
isn't it, girls?

05:31.498 --> 05:34.333
We're just so thrilled you
could come for a visit

05:34.335 --> 05:35.100
Before your big trip.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.703
Pinkie pie has told
us so much about you.

05:37.705 --> 05:41.406
I'm twilight and this is
applejack, fluttershy,

05:41.408 --> 05:43.575
Rainbow dash, and rarity.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.077
We're ever so
glad to meet you.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.746
We're just gonna
have the best time.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.685
Pinkie pie tells me you
share my love for fashion.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.055
I'm really into expressing
myself through my wardrobe.

05:57.057 --> 06:02.094
And what is the delightful
frock you're wearing now saying?

06:03.129 --> 06:04.563
It doesn't talk.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.697
It's a dress.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.667
Oh! Yes. Of course.
I just meant...

06:08.669 --> 06:12.104
<i>(nervous gibberish)</i>

06:12.106 --> 06:13.605
<i>(dog barks)</i>

06:13.607 --> 06:15.941
Uh. So this here's winona.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.442
<i>That's owlowiscious...</i>

06:17.444 --> 06:19.611
Tank, opal, and angel.

06:19.613 --> 06:23.382
Pinkie pie told us
you have a pet, too.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.916
He's in my pocket.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.119
Oooh, you have a pocket pet?

06:27.121 --> 06:28.587
Like a tiny mouse?

06:28.589 --> 06:29.755
Or a baby bird?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.823
Or a trained butterfly?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.159
It's a rock.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.399
His name is boulder.

06:40.767 --> 06:44.669
This is going to be the best,
most awesome, funnest week ever.

06:44.671 --> 06:49.441
I can't wait for us all
to become bestest friends.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.544
<i>(nervous chuckles)</i>

06:59.152 --> 07:02.187
Maud? Would ya care to
try one of granny smith's

07:02.189 --> 07:04.823
Famous apple spice muffins?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.858
<i>(sniffing)</i>

07:06.860 --> 07:08.927
Oh, uh, ha, that's not--

07:08.929 --> 07:14.199
<i>(munching)</i>

07:14.201 --> 07:16.067
It's crunchy.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.172
Maud's right. They
are crunchy!

07:20.174 --> 07:21.206
<i>(slurp)</i>

07:21.208 --> 07:22.774
Yum.

07:22.842 --> 07:26.678
So, uh, pinkie pie
tells us you like games.

07:26.813 --> 07:30.882
Boulder and I sometimes play a
game called "camouflage."

07:30.884 --> 07:32.818
It's kind of like
"hide-and-seek,"

07:32.820 --> 07:35.687
But way more intense.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.190
Awesome.

07:43.529 --> 07:43.929
Any luck?

07:43.931 --> 07:45.964
I truly wish I had spent
more time with boulder,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.733
Because I'm having a very
hard time remembering

07:48.735 --> 07:49.901
What he looks like.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.737
It's like lookin' for
a pebble in a haystack.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.774
More like, "in a pile
of pebbles."

07:55.842 --> 07:58.577
Well, you don't have to
make it even harder.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.212
Agh! I give
up.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.012
This is impossible.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.682
It'll hurt maud's feelings
if we all stop playing.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.852
Besides, look how much
fun pinkie pie is having.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.956
Is this it? Is this it?
Is this it? Is this it?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.858
Just a little longer, ok?

08:12.860 --> 08:15.927
(groan) all right. Fine.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.996
<i>Maud: Found him.</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:19.097
Where was he?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.867
He was hiding in my pocket.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.735
Oh, come on!

08:28.040 --> 08:30.942
(squeaking)

08:30.944 --> 08:31.843
I don't mean to interrupt,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.678
But we really should get these
little critters home.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.982
It's getting awfully late and
they've had a very busy day.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.683
Maud and I'd better
get going, too.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.585
I want her to taste
the rock candy

08:40.587 --> 08:41.887
We're going to use for our...

08:41.889 --> 08:44.689
...Best friends necklaces.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.024
Oh yeah!

08:49.562 --> 08:53.031
She sure is different
from what I expected.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.900
We spent all day
digging in the dirt

08:54.902 --> 08:57.802
And he was in her pocket
the whole time?

08:57.804 --> 09:01.540
On the bright side, boulder
seemed really sweet.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.608
He's a rock!

09:03.610 --> 09:04.142
Come on, girls.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.811
I'm sure maud was just nervous
about meeting all of us.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.114
Maybe she was just
acting a little "off"

09:09.116 --> 09:11.216
Because she's shy or somethin'.

09:11.218 --> 09:11.816
Exactly.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.753
It must be awfully intimidating
to meet all of us at once,

09:14.755 --> 09:17.956
Especially since we're
already such good friends.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.191
<i>(agreeement)</i>

09:20.193 --> 09:23.595
Maybe if we spent some
time with her one-on-one

09:23.597 --> 09:24.663
To try to get to
know her better?

09:24.665 --> 09:28.166
I'm sure we'll be making those
best-friend rock candy necklaces

09:28.168 --> 09:29.935
In no time.

09:30.770 --> 09:31.870
<i>Rarity: Where shall we start?</i>

09:31.872 --> 09:35.774
I've chosen a few fabrics
I think would be stunning with--

09:36.943 --> 09:38.176
Choices, choices, choices.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.780
Of course, if you don't see
anything that speaks to you,

09:41.782 --> 09:43.582
I would be happy to suggest--

09:43.584 --> 09:46.051
I like this one.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.652
<i>(giggling)</i>

09:47.654 --> 09:51.189
Pinkie pie didn't tell
us you were so funny.

09:52.792 --> 09:53.825
What do you mean?

09:53.827 --> 09:58.797
Oh, well, it's just, I
believe that is a dish towel.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.769
But, it does go very
well with your complexion.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.638
I'm sure I could
work my magic
