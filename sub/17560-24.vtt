WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
This is just
a get-to-know-you dinner.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.296
Alright?
And if it goes well

00:05.380 --> 00:06.840
then maybe somewhere
down the road

00:06.923 --> 00:08.591
I will feel comfortable
enough to explore

00:08.675 --> 00:10.719
my physical
boundaries with you.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.222
- Goodnight, Val.
- Goodnight, Todd.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.435
- Yeah, where you at?
- 'I'm in Princeton.'

00:18.518 --> 00:19.936
(Holly)
'I'm visiting Henry.'

00:20.019 --> 00:21.354
Don't you see, Holly

00:21.438 --> 00:23.022
that when things
get not perfect

00:23.106 --> 00:25.358
you start looking
for other guys.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.360
With me, it was Vince.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.529
With Ben, it was Vince.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.448
Do you see a pattern?

00:32.531 --> 00:35.076
The pattern is Vince.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.621
Henry, you're so smart.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.874
If I didn't date you
and break up with you

00:40.957 --> 00:42.375
and then date you
and break up with you

00:42.459 --> 00:44.377
I would so date you again.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.050
That's my girlfriend.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.343
What's her name?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.430
Her name's Holly,
and that's not sick.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.807
(Henry)
'I love you, Holly.'

01:01.269 --> 01:03.772
[instrumental music]

01:08.568 --> 01:10.737
- Okay, that has got to stop.
- What?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.989
The teeth, the mouth,
the happiness.

01:13.072 --> 01:17.035
You know, either share what
you're on or get the hell out.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.455
[gasps]
Oh, God. Did you see the cherry
blossoms starting to spring?

01:20.538 --> 01:21.831
Oh, I know.
And did you see

01:21.915 --> 01:24.042
how gorgeous and green
Central Park turned?

01:24.125 --> 01:26.544
- I know!
- Oh!

01:29.380 --> 01:31.216
- I couldn't wait to see you.
- Me, too.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.967
- Okay, you go first.
- Okay, no, you go.

01:33.051 --> 01:36.513
Okay, um, my date with Todd
last night was so incredible.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.181
You had sex
with the plumber

01:38.264 --> 01:41.684
and you come in here talking
about frickin' cherry blossoms?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.937
I did not have sex
with Todd, and it turned out

01:44.020 --> 01:45.980
to be one of the best dates
I've ever had.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.566
I'm befuddled.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.193
Now, I'm not saying
that I'm in love with Todd

01:50.276 --> 01:52.278
or anything, but it's
the first date that I've had

01:52.362 --> 01:54.864
in a long time where I did not
think about Rick once.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.660
Oh, my God, good for you.
now on to me.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.329
You know how I used to always
sabotage my relationships

02:01.412 --> 02:03.498
because I was afraid
they wouldn't be perfect?

02:03.581 --> 02:04.999
Well, after visiting
Henry in Princeton

02:05.083 --> 02:07.293
I realized that mature
and healthy relationships

02:07.377 --> 02:10.463
aren't perfect.
I've really grown up.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.048
Hot dog!

02:14.259 --> 02:16.261
You know how whenever
Vince and I would fight

02:16.344 --> 02:18.555
I would run away?
Well, that's old Holly.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.598
New Holly hangs in there.
Why?

02:20.682 --> 02:23.518
Because that's what you do
when you love somebody

02:23.601 --> 02:24.727
and I love Vince.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.896
I love Vince!
I love Vince!

02:26.980 --> 02:29.274
I hate Holly! I hate Holly!
I hate Holly!

02:29.357 --> 02:31.401
I can't believe
she and Henry..

02:31.484 --> 02:32.861
I mean, if she was gonna
sleep with anyone

02:32.944 --> 02:34.863
in the line of succession,
it should have been me

02:34.946 --> 02:36.364
you, and then Henry.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.826
You know, you're doing the right
thing by leaving town, man.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.370
And don't worry, I'm gonna take
real good care of your bedroom.

02:42.453 --> 02:46.207
You don't mind if I Feng Shui
it up a little bit, do you?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.751
Do whatever you want, I may
never come back from Florida.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.463
Oh, in that case, I ordered
a couple of sconces from Europe.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.508
Yeah, whatever,
a little gay.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.139
My buddy in Boca needs
a bartender for the summer.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.932
But I just may stay down
there forever.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.767
I could chill
with some geezers.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.812
How good do my pants
look up here?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.272
[cell phone ringing]

03:09.355 --> 03:12.150
Are you sure you don't
want to talk to her, man?

03:12.233 --> 03:14.235
Damn, it's her again.
Like I need to hear

03:14.319 --> 03:15.445
that she's back with Henry.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.113
I never wanna talk
to her again.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.324
I never want to hear
that girl's name ever again.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.701
Do you hear me?
Never. Never.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.786
Hey, Vince, uh,
if you could call me back

03:23.870 --> 03:25.204
when you get this message,
that'd be great.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.998
I just have something
to tell you, thanks.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.834
[whispering]
I love you.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.920
Oh, my God. So how much
do you love the new Holly?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.756
Yeah, well, almost as much
as I love the new Val.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.467
Oh, look at me
staring at this paper

03:37.550 --> 03:39.719
open to the wedding
announcement page.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.387
Three months ago, this would
have sent me right into

03:41.471 --> 03:43.848
the arms of Jose Cuervo.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.976
But now I can honestly
be happy for all these people.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.811
"Karen and Peter,"
congratulations.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.064
'"Vanessa and David,"
all the best.'

03:51.147 --> 03:54.233
Ah! Uh! "Marco and Steve,"
fabulous!

03:55.276 --> 03:57.487
"Rick and Julie,"
all the..

03:57.570 --> 03:58.655
"Rick and Julie?"

03:58.738 --> 04:01.032
Hey, that's weird,
they have the same names

04:01.115 --> 04:02.909
as your ex and his ex.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.452
Oh, and the same faces.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.165
Rick and Julie are
getting married tomorrow?

04:09.248 --> 04:12.126
Val, look, um,
Fantasia's playing Golda

04:12.210 --> 04:13.962
in "Fiddler on the Roof."

04:14.045 --> 04:15.463
I can't believe
they're getting married.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.300
Look, look, it's 30% off
at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.720
Ooh, we can get a really
nice wedding gift for..

04:22.804 --> 04:24.681
...Marco and Steve.

Oh, my God, I cannot believe
that Rick and Julie

05:13.146 --> 05:15.314
are getting married.
This is going to kill her.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.276

She's come such a long way.

- No!

I'm just clearing the table,
I'm fine, really.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.289
I am okay with Rick
and Julie getting married.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.498
Val, I mean, come on.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.125
This has to be
really hard for you.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.169

And you know what? I don't want
this fun day to end, okay?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.099
So we are all gonna go out
tonight, girls night out.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.934
We'll get all gussied up,
and we'll celebrate

05:52.018 --> 05:53.394
Rick and Julie's nuptials

05:53.478 --> 05:56.689
Holly's new love,
Lauren's new, uh..

05:57.523 --> 05:59.734
My rash cleared up.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.194
Yeah! Sweet!

06:02.528 --> 06:05.114
Okay, so everything's
on me, 8'o clock.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.741
Okay, I know
what she needs.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.160
Yeah, there's Kahlua
in the maple syrup bottle

06:09.243 --> 06:11.454
next to the vodka vinegar.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.081
You're not gonna
believe this.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.249
You know how I was supposed
to go to Europe with my mom?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.126
Yes, first class
all the way

06:17.210 --> 06:18.628
balloon trips
through Tuscany.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.172
You're rich,
blah, blah, blah..

06:21.255 --> 06:22.715
Yeah, well,
my mom bailed.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.175
She threw her
back out having sex

06:24.258 --> 06:25.176
with a 30-year-old.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.761
Now I have this extra ticket

06:26.844 --> 06:28.221
and Holly can't take
a month off work.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.806
- I can! You?
- I can! You?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.058
Well, how hard is it to
take off from a bakery?

06:32.141 --> 06:34.519
Hello, where do I work?

06:34.602 --> 06:37.313
- I'm more fun.
- Well, I, I'm prettier.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.815
I'll, I'll make
her laugh.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.982
Well, I'll have
sex with her.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.859
So will I!

06:43.361 --> 06:45.988
Okay, you each bring
different things to the party.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.616
You know, you're both worthy
traveling companions.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.284
I'll think about it,
and I'll get back to you

06:50.368 --> 06:51.869
in 24 hours?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.539
- Fair enough.
- That's totally fair.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.041
This is a little something
for pretty ladies.

hasn't called me back.

Mm, hey, hey,
put that phone down.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.037
Come on, we are toasting
Rick and Julie.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.874
Yeah, we've been toasting
them for three pitchers.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.459
Well, they're a heck
of a couple.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.919
Okay, to Rick and Julie.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.379
(all)
To Rick and Julie.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.382
- She's totally suicidal.
- She's smashed.

07:46.465 --> 07:49.594

I love you guys so much.

so good to laugh.

I do.

I adore drinking, don't you?
It's so good.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.624
But now I have to tinkle.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.084
I love tinkling, too.
Shh, shh.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.419
Okay.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.670

08:28.549 --> 08:31.427

that she's gonna be okay.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:32.886 --> 08:35.431
What are you doing,
traveling companion?

08:35.514 --> 08:37.725
You know, that chicken skin
will kill you.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.895
Let me get that
for you, baby girl.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.480
You know, when we
travel around Europe

08:42.563 --> 08:46.359
I will remove all the icky
parts of the food for you.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.736
Gary got me a purse.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.781
Watch.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.743
I can't believe
that he hasn't called me back.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.119
I hate him!

08:57.203 --> 08:59.330
There he is.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.250
[gasps]
I love him!

09:02.333 --> 09:04.460
Damn, man!
Holly's here.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.170
It's not enough
she left me 30 messages?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.256
Now I gotta hear in person
how she's back with Henry?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.591
You know we should go. You don't
wanna end up getting drunk

09:10.675 --> 09:12.093
suddenly find her
adorable again

09:12.176 --> 09:15.596
end up not leaving,
I'll be back on the couch.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.723
I mean, I will miss you.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.018
Ooh, I hate her so much.
And you know what?

09:21.102 --> 09:22.812
I'm gonna tell her before
she has a chance to tell me

09:22.895 --> 09:24.230
about her and Henry and how
they're all in each other's--

09:24.313 --> 09:26.107
Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude,
now, now hold on.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.817
Now, if you tell Holly
that you hate her

09:27.900 --> 09:29.777
she's gonna ask you why,
and, then you're gonna

09:29.860 --> 09:31.028
have to tell her
that you followed her

09:31.112 --> 09:32.154
all the way to Princeton

09:32.238 --> 09:34.490
like that "Felicity" chick.

09:34.573 --> 09:35.658
And that you found out
Holly's in love

09:35.741 --> 09:36.993
with her old boyfriend.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.537
[chuckles]
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

09:41.038 --> 09:43.249
Well, it doesn't.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.126
You know what, man?
You're right.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.336

Hey. So, um, did you
get my messages?

Oh, yeah, sorry, I've just
been so busy packing.

- I'm going to Florida tomorrow.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.453
I'm gonna spend the summer down
there bartending for a buddy.

What? Wait, you're going
on a trip tomorrow

10:24.040 --> 10:25.708
and you weren't even
gonna tell me?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.752
Yeah, a lot of people
go on trips

10:27.835 --> 10:30.212
and don't tell other
people about them.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.214
Okay, what's that
supposed to mean?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.300
Nothing, just means
I'm going.

I'm your problem?

drive each other kinda nuts.

every time we're together

10:48.022 --> 10:48.939
we end up in a fight.

the making right now.

And guess what?
I'm sick of it.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.738
Okay, well, if you would
just shut up and let me talk

10:55.821 --> 10:56.739
then we wouldn't fight.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.157

we're fighting.

you keep interrupting.

calling you all day?

what you want.

what I want.

some fun again.

and I hope you stay there

Fine! You know what? I have
nothing else to say to you!

because you know what?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.408
I have you programmed
in my cell phone

11:40.491 --> 11:42.118
and if you call,
I'll see it's you

11:42.201 --> 11:43.536

18:53.465 --> 18:55.300
Oh, well,
I've never owned one

18:55.384 --> 18:57.719
but that looks vaguely
like a wedding ring!

18:57.803 --> 19:01.557
- You got married?
- Yeah, apparently!

19:01.640 --> 19:02.891
Okay, wait,
this is amazing.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.810
After planning
that whole wedding

19:04.893 --> 19:06.228
and breaking up with him

19:06.311 --> 19:08.105
you finally married..

19:09.523 --> 19:11.900
Morning, wife.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.819
The plumber?

19:13.902 --> 19:15.988
- Aah!
- Oh!

(Holly)
'Oh, my God, Tina, I did it.'

19:27.916 --> 19:29.543
'I broke into Vince's car.'

19:29.626 --> 19:32.546
'No, it wasn't that hard,
it's a convertible.'

19:32.629 --> 19:34.006
You know, I'm actually
really nervous.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.591
Maybe I, maybe I should
just get out

19:35.674 --> 19:37.009
and forget this whole thing.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.343
Are you kidding?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.721
This is the most romantic thing
I have ever heard.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.306
When Vince sees you pop up

19:42.389 --> 19:45.100
from the back seat all naked..

19:45.183 --> 19:47.853
Tina, I'm popping dressed.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.192
I'm gonna say to him,
Vince, I love you

19:53.275 --> 19:54.818
and I'm going to
Florida with you.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.279
And I know I've said that
before not the Florida part

19:57.362 --> 20:00.073
the I love you part,
but this time it's different.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.450
'I don't care
if it's not perfect.'

20:01.533 --> 20:02.910
'It doesn't have to be perfect.'

20:02.993 --> 20:04.661
I'm ready,
and I don't want to be with

20:04.745 --> 20:07.748
anybody else ever again.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.666
Oh, my God, he's here!
I gotta go! I love you! Bye!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
Bye! Bye!

20:14.671 --> 20:16.798
- 'Vince?'
- 'Yeah?'

20:16.882 --> 20:17.966
Where should I put
my luggage?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.093
Oh, just throw it
in the back.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.726
Last night was so amazing.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.978
I'm glad it doesn't
have to end.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.524
This is so cool,
you just picking up

20:34.608 --> 20:36.860
and driving with me
all the way to Florida.

20:39.696 --> 20:43.533
Well, got a full tank of gas
and a bag of Cheetos.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.787
I figure we don't have
to stop till..

20:46.870 --> 20:48.038
...Virginia.
