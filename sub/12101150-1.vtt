01:44.761 --> 01:46.630
I hope she's on time tonight.

01:47.731 --> 01:49.064
Who, Katie?

01:51.368 --> 01:52.702
Of course she will.

01:52.736 --> 01:54.605
Well, you know what she's like.

01:54.639 --> 01:57.073
Takes her three hours
just to do her hair.

01:57.107 --> 02:00.778
Oh, I remember a time when you
were like that, young lady.

02:00.812 --> 02:03.046
Well, I wasn't taking
pictures of myself

02:03.079 --> 02:04.515
every two minutes.

02:04.549 --> 02:08.019
And that's a shame
because I wish you would.

02:10.556 --> 02:13.659
Well, I just hope she
realizes how important

02:13.692 --> 02:15.360
this evening is.

02:15.394 --> 02:16.628
I'm sure she does.

02:16.662 --> 02:18.465
Please, don't worry about it.

02:19.432 --> 02:23.336
Just let's concentrate on this.

02:23.369 --> 02:24.537
Cheers.

02:24.571 --> 02:26.104
To us.

02:26.138 --> 02:27.707
And the city we love the most.

02:31.044 --> 02:31.812
Yeah.

02:52.634 --> 02:53.836
Eddie!

02:55.203 --> 02:56.606
Come here.

02:56.639 --> 02:58.173
Good to see you.

02:58.206 --> 02:59.342
Oh, good for you.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.308
Good to see you.

03:00.343 --> 03:01.243
Come.

03:01.276 --> 03:03.446
Let's go have some lunch.

03:03.479 --> 03:06.282
Uncle Richard's
not coming tonight?

03:06.315 --> 03:07.384
Richard?

03:07.417 --> 03:09.218
Slow again, is he?

03:10.086 --> 03:11.355
How is Richard anyway?

03:11.388 --> 03:13.289
Well, Uncle Richard's...

03:13.323 --> 03:14.358
I know.

03:14.391 --> 03:15.759
Uncle Richard.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.563
I don't see much of him
when you ain't around.

03:18.596 --> 03:21.633
He likes to keep ya
at arm's length.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.166
Yeah, of course he does.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.302
Don't think he's ever
liked me much, though.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.472
Yeah, well, he doesn't
like anyone much, Eddie.

03:28.473 --> 03:30.108
Now that's not
quite true, Sadie.

03:30.141 --> 03:31.577
Oh, come on, John.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.811
I know he's your brother,

03:32.845 --> 03:34.446
but he's always
been jealous of you.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.314
He's a pain in the ass.

03:36.348 --> 03:40.386
I mean, God knows how
Janet puts up with him.

03:40.419 --> 03:42.856
We're gonna be seeing him in
a couple of days anyway, Eddie.

03:44.223 --> 03:45.759
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.562
We're meeting Katie's new
lady friend at the apartment.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.798
The old meet the parents, eh?

03:51.831 --> 03:53.299
Yeah, something like that.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.869
You should come along, you know.

03:54.902 --> 03:55.870
Be interesting.

03:55.903 --> 03:56.871
You think so?

03:56.904 --> 04:00.240
Well, you are family, after all.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.443
Yeah, well, more than
Richard will ever be.

04:12.688 --> 04:14.356
And there it goes.

04:14.389 --> 04:16.290
Another one
for the freaks?

04:17.326 --> 04:18.461
Wait.

04:19.362 --> 04:20.529
What?

04:20.563 --> 04:21.930
Your turn.

04:21.964 --> 04:23.333
No way.

04:23.366 --> 04:25.401
- Strike a pose.
- No.

04:25.435 --> 04:26.736
Come on.

04:26.769 --> 04:27.637
Do it for the Gram.

04:27.670 --> 04:28.838
No way.

04:28.871 --> 04:30.341
What's the point?

04:30.374 --> 04:32.308
It's not like you ever
post anything of me.

04:33.377 --> 04:34.845
All right.

04:36.279 --> 04:37.615
Don't worry.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.583
I'm used to being your
dirty, little secret.

04:39.617 --> 04:40.784
Zoe.

04:40.818 --> 04:41.786
Kate.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.289
You know why.

04:45.322 --> 04:48.393
- Do I?
- Come on.

04:48.426 --> 04:50.462
How many times have
we been through it?

04:52.464 --> 04:53.733
Don't be like that.

04:53.766 --> 04:55.266
Like what?

04:55.300 --> 04:56.569
Like that.

04:56.602 --> 04:58.303
All I'm saying is I
don't understand why

04:58.337 --> 04:59.538
you keep us on the quiet.

05:00.873 --> 05:04.309
Look, you know all my
followers are guys.

05:04.343 --> 05:05.846
If they knew about me,

05:05.879 --> 05:07.881
if they knew about us,

05:07.914 --> 05:09.716
they'd lose interest.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.685
I'd lose followers.

05:11.718 --> 05:15.622
Is it really that hard to choose
between followers and happiness?

05:15.656 --> 05:17.892
That is not fair, Zoe.

05:17.925 --> 05:20.328
Everyone who needs to
know about us does.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.575
All these secrets.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.514
Shit, it's Mum.

05:40.281 --> 05:41.450
They've landed.

05:41.483 --> 05:42.652
They'll be here soon.

05:42.686 --> 05:43.920
We still need to get ready.

05:43.953 --> 05:45.455
So?

05:45.488 --> 05:47.222
So you need to get out of here.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.894
I don't want their
first time meeting you

05:50.927 --> 05:52.896
to be as you're
running out the door.

05:53.898 --> 05:56.467
I want it to be perfect, okay?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.503
It's just a couple more days.

05:59.537 --> 06:02.807
They're really looking
forward to seeing you.

06:06.044 --> 06:08.547
Ladies and gentlemen,
time now to meet

06:08.580 --> 06:11.717
one of Project Solace's
longest serving

06:11.750 --> 06:14.720
and indeed most
generous benefactors.

06:14.753 --> 06:18.624
He's flown in especially
to be with us here tonight.

06:18.658 --> 06:22.628
Will you please welcome
Mr. John Morgan.

06:27.633 --> 06:28.768
Thank you.

06:32.406 --> 06:33.807
Thank you.

06:33.841 --> 06:35.008
Thank you.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.377
I am so pleased
to be here, truly.

06:37.411 --> 06:41.482
The last 25 years I've been
involved with this function,

06:41.515 --> 06:43.485
this amazing charity,

06:43.518 --> 06:45.687
has given me so much pleasure.

06:47.021 --> 06:50.692
So much that I would like
to give a little bit back.

06:59.435 --> 07:00.903
How is that?

07:00.936 --> 07:02.104
Thank you!

07:02.138 --> 07:04.039
Thank you very much.

07:10.547 --> 07:13.550
Now, with your permission,

07:14.818 --> 07:17.622
I would like to talk
about honour and...

07:17.655 --> 07:20.925
Yeah, you want to
talk about honour?

07:20.958 --> 07:22.727
Eh?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.028
Why is that?

07:24.061 --> 07:27.865
Oh, that must be
honour amongst thieves.

07:27.899 --> 07:29.400
What, what was that?

07:29.433 --> 07:31.470
What was that, what was that?
What was that?

07:31.503 --> 07:34.506
Oh, what, oh, no, I think
you heard me perfectly.

07:34.540 --> 07:38.010
Still up to your same
old tricks, eh, John?

07:38.043 --> 07:39.912
I'm sorry, have we met?

07:39.945 --> 07:41.113
I'm not familiar.

07:41.146 --> 07:42.515
No, you wouldn't be, would you?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.384
Sir, this is a private function.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.921
Yeah, why don't you go and
get me the other glass?

07:47.954 --> 07:49.355
Oi.

07:49.389 --> 07:51.357
- Show yourself right now.
- It's all right.

07:51.391 --> 07:53.126
- What's going on, John?
- It's all right.

07:53.159 --> 07:54.695
- John, what's going on?
- He's just leaving.

07:54.728 --> 07:56.964
No, he's not just leaving.

07:56.997 --> 07:58.933
He's staying put!

07:59.800 --> 08:01.135
Really?

08:01.168 --> 08:03.003
Lies and deceit.

08:03.037 --> 08:04.839
Comes so natural.

08:04.872 --> 08:06.641
It's a pleasure to watch.

08:09.945 --> 08:11.613
It's been awhile, Frank.

08:11.646 --> 08:12.547
Has it?

08:12.581 --> 08:13.682
Yeah.

08:13.715 --> 08:15.817
Shame it's not a
little bit longer.

08:15.851 --> 08:17.118
Shame?

08:17.152 --> 08:19.655
No, that's not a shame.

08:21.691 --> 08:24.193
Look, as the gentleman said,

08:24.227 --> 08:25.928
this is a private function.

08:25.962 --> 08:27.430
So if you wouldn't mind?

08:27.463 --> 08:28.898
But I do mind.

08:28.931 --> 08:31.969
I had to get a bus and
two jeeps to get here.

08:33.236 --> 08:34.770
So what do you want, you prick?

08:34.804 --> 08:36.440
Oh, well, you see,

08:36.472 --> 08:38.442
when I heard on the grapevine,

08:38.475 --> 08:39.809
hey, it wasn't the grapevine,

08:39.842 --> 08:43.514
it was someone you
know really well,

08:43.548 --> 08:45.550
and it's not the only
thing they told me.

08:46.684 --> 08:49.654
That the great John Morgan
was flying in

08:49.687 --> 08:51.956
for this beautiful occasion,

08:51.990 --> 08:54.627
well, I had to see
this for myself.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.863
100 grand out of
your own pocket.

08:57.897 --> 09:00.199
Aren't you generous

09:00.232 --> 09:01.867
with your ill-gotten gain?

09:01.901 --> 09:06.072
You see, what's a shame
is all these people falling

09:06.106 --> 09:08.541
for your lies and bullshit.

09:08.575 --> 09:12.145
Or maybe they just go along with
your endless fucking charade.

09:13.079 --> 09:14.681
You are way out of your depth.

09:14.714 --> 09:18.019
Do yourself a favour
and fuck off.

09:18.052 --> 09:21.155
I just want everybody to
know where that came from.

09:22.089 --> 09:24.725
I just want people to know who

09:24.759 --> 09:28.462
or what you really are.

09:28.496 --> 09:29.564
Oh, really?

09:31.533 --> 09:32.801
What more am I, Frank?

09:34.236 --> 09:37.005
Well, you're a lying,
murdering bastard.

09:37.039 --> 09:38.473
Sir, you need to leave now

09:38.507 --> 09:40.742
or I'm going to
phone the police.

09:40.776 --> 09:42.045
I am the police.

09:43.513 --> 09:44.814
I see you're still
carrying around

09:44.847 --> 09:46.849
that little tin badge,
hey, sheriff?

09:48.184 --> 09:52.655
Yeah, and if I'm not
much mistaken,

09:54.558 --> 09:58.862
I think you're partial
to a drink or 10 still.

09:58.896 --> 10:00.497
Yeah, people don't
change much, do they?

10:00.531 --> 10:01.665
No, John.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.734
They don't.

10:07.839 --> 10:10.041
Look, all these nice people

10:10.075 --> 10:12.110
have come here
to enjoy themselves

10:12.143 --> 10:14.679
and celebrate this
wonderful cause.

10:15.947 --> 10:18.250
So could we do
this another time?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.724
I've got a source on you.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.294
We're gonna have a long chat,

10:28.327 --> 10:31.732
and I've waited a
long time for this.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.567
You're gonna have to wait
a little bit longer, I think,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.303
because your
posse's arrived, sheriff.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.738
Sir.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.107
Stand back.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.043
All right, sir.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.311
Have a nice day, Frank.

10:43.344 --> 10:45.079
Back in one moment.

10:45.113 --> 10:46.647
Oh!

10:46.681 --> 10:47.548
- Dad!
- John!

10:51.886 --> 10:53.321
Back off!

10:53.354 --> 10:55.190
Back off.

10:55.224 --> 10:56.258
Back off.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.259
Get him out.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.260
You all right, John?

10:58.293 --> 11:00.329
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

11:00.363 --> 11:01.196
You all right?

11:01.230 --> 11:02.564
Yeah, good. I'm fine.

11:02.598 --> 11:03.966
It's all right, everybody.

11:03.999 --> 11:05.969
He's just some drunk who
couldn't hold his liquor.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.170
That's all.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.806
So, shall we get on
with the evening?

11:24.121 --> 11:26.157
Read the papers today, Conway?

11:27.224 --> 11:28.793
I don't really read papers.

11:29.694 --> 11:31.196
Perhaps you should start.

11:36.402 --> 11:38.103
So how is everything?

11:38.136 --> 11:39.104
Fine.

11:40.872 --> 11:41.841
Everything's fine.

11:41.874 --> 11:43.377
Well, you could've fooled me.

11:47.246 --> 11:49.882
This about my social life?

11:49.916 --> 11:52.018
You want to start approving
my diary or something?

11:52.051 --> 11:54.021
Ten in the morning, Frank.

11:54.054 --> 11:56.623
And there's a cheap single malt
on your breath.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.728
How many times do
we have to do this?

12:04.131 --> 12:06.000
There comes a time
when enough is enough.

12:07.035 --> 12:09.237
Oh, really, is that so?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.739
Come on, Frank,
let's be serious.

12:13.708 --> 12:16.711
When was the last time
that you were, well, you?

12:19.449 --> 12:21.016
What do you mean?

12:21.050 --> 12:23.686
I remember when
you got your start.

12:25.154 --> 12:29.191
You were fresh-faced
and hopeful.

12:29.225 --> 12:31.628
Full of piss and vinegar,
just like your father.

12:33.363 --> 12:35.165
But that fire went out long ago,

12:35.198 --> 12:37.401
and what's left not
as much as an ember.

12:39.370 --> 12:41.305
I can't say we haven't
tried to help ya.

12:41.339 --> 12:43.408
I told you before I don't
need that kind of help.

12:43.442 --> 12:45.410
What you need and what
you think you need

12:45.444 --> 12:46.844
are two very different things.

12:46.878 --> 12:48.447
I know exactly what I need.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.381
Do you, Frank, really?

12:49.414 --> 12:50.815
Assistance!

12:53.886 --> 12:58.424
My source told me that
Morgan was flying into town.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.193
I went and rattled him a little,

13:01.226 --> 13:04.730
see if I could make
something fall out.

13:04.763 --> 13:07.033
Mark my words, something will.

13:09.169 --> 13:10.471
Whatever pit it is
you're in, Frank,

13:10.504 --> 13:14.174
you are at the
very bottom of it.

13:14.207 --> 13:16.075
How many hands have reached
out to you over the years

13:16.109 --> 13:18.045
and you haven't
taken a single one?

13:21.215 --> 13:23.317
Suppose I should've seen
something like this coming.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.785
- Guv.
- Perhaps I did,

13:24.818 --> 13:25.886
I just didn't want
to believe it.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.121
Guv, this is...

13:27.154 --> 13:28.322
If you want to continue
down this path

13:28.355 --> 13:30.192
of self-destruction,
then so be it.

13:31.826 --> 13:33.396
But I cannot and I will not

13:33.429 --> 13:35.764
let you drag the
Met down with you.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.469
I'm afraid this only
leaves us with one option.

13:42.506 --> 13:43.473
No.

13:43.507 --> 13:45.208
You leave me no choice, Frank.

13:47.276 --> 13:48.144
Harry, please, no.

13:48.177 --> 13:50.146
Effective immediately

13:50.179 --> 13:52.081
you are suspended from duty.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.888
I'm sorry.

14:02.427 --> 14:03.961
For God's sake.

14:04.962 --> 14:05.930
Frank.

14:07.932 --> 14:08.900
Get some help.

14:11.836 --> 14:12.770
Please.

14:16.307 --> 14:19.044
Pinning something on Morgan's
where I needed the help.

14:21.514 --> 14:23.215
But nothing sticks, does it?

14:24.817 --> 14:25.951
Funny, that.

14:34.495 --> 14:36.763
Yes, I'm aware.

14:41.403 --> 14:42.370
And?

14:42.404 --> 14:44.905
And I wouldn't worry about it.

14:44.939 --> 14:45.906
Wouldn't worry about it?

14:45.940 --> 14:47.108
Have you even fucking read it?

14:47.141 --> 14:49.378
Please, just forget about him.

14:49.411 --> 14:50.978
He's a fucking nuisance.

14:51.012 --> 14:52.414
And he's a liability.

14:52.447 --> 14:54.450
Are you quite finished?

14:54.484 --> 14:55.418
No.

14:55.451 --> 14:56.918
Sebastian,

14:56.952 --> 14:59.087
I'm not quite finished.

14:59.121 --> 15:02.991
Lions don't lose sleep over
the opinion of sheep, John.

15:03.025 --> 15:04.293
You know that.

15:04.326 --> 15:05.361
Oh, don't give me
that, Sebastian.

15:05.396 --> 15:06.397
You're our solicitor.

15:06.430 --> 15:07.598
Do something!

15:07.631 --> 15:09.232
And what exactly
would you have me do?

15:09.265 --> 15:11.468
And yes, I have fucking read it.

15:11.502 --> 15:12.835
I don't know. Something!

15:12.869 --> 15:14.037
Oh, Sadie, my dear.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.472
Believe me,
it will all blow over.

15:15.506 --> 15:17.542
Please stop worrying.

15:17.575 --> 15:19.444
Don't my dear me, Sebastian.

15:19.477 --> 15:20.377
You weren't there last night.

15:20.412 --> 15:22.246
It was a fucking disaster!

15:22.279 --> 15:24.449
A disaster that ended
in spontaneous applause

15:24.482 --> 15:27.419
for your husband's defiance,
no less.

15:28.653 --> 15:31.022
After all these fucking years,

15:31.056 --> 15:34.859
Conway's still sticking his
snout where it's not needed.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.229
Yeah, he's very much
his father's son.

15:38.263 --> 15:41.635
How do these little piss heads
get their rocks off, Sebastian?

15:41.668 --> 15:43.369
These kind are all the same.

15:43.403 --> 15:45.371
They forget about everything
except what drove him

15:45.405 --> 15:47.873
to the bottle in
the first place.

15:47.907 --> 15:51.877
Listen, it's all perception.

15:51.911 --> 15:53.448
Conway was the one
who was dragged out

15:53.481 --> 15:57.652
of that dinner party by the
scruff of his neck, not you.

15:57.685 --> 15:59.219
You look like the victim.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.457
Because I am the victim.

16:02.490 --> 16:04.291
Then you've nothing to fear.

16:04.324 --> 16:06.961
Conway's story will be the
same as every other man

16:06.994 --> 16:08.564
who's ever got in your way.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.536
So tonight when we get back,

16:14.570 --> 16:16.405
I'll call Trish.

16:16.438 --> 16:17.339
I'll book a nice table
at the Sheesh tonight.

16:17.373 --> 16:18.374
- Mr. Morgan.
- Yeah.

16:18.408 --> 16:20.242
Good afternoon.

16:20.275 --> 16:23.078
Steve, what are you doing here?

16:23.112 --> 16:24.614
Mr. Osborne would
like to see you.

16:24.647 --> 16:27.450
See me?
What for?

16:27.484 --> 16:29.520
Welcome you home.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.355
Well, tell your boss
now's not a good time.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.524
Yeah, she's right.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.426
We're only here for
a couple of days

16:35.459 --> 16:37.695
and I've got some important
business to catch up with.

16:37.728 --> 16:39.996
Ask Damien if he wouldn't mind
seeing me tomorrow, yeah?

16:40.029 --> 16:41.232
Really must insist.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.167
Now come on, let's go.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.536
No, no, no, Sadie, it's okay.

16:44.569 --> 16:45.970
He's right.

16:46.003 --> 16:48.339
If Damien wants to
see me, he sees me.

16:48.372 --> 16:50.174
Eddie, do me a favour.

16:50.207 --> 16:52.411
Take Sadie back to
the apartment, will ya?

16:52.444 --> 16:53.413
You sure?

16:53.446 --> 16:54.547
Yeah, catch up with you later.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.748
Don't smoke her
to death, though.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.948
See ya later.

16:56.982 --> 16:57.750
- Okay, tonight.
- Sheesh tonight.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.184
Tonight.

18:36.423 --> 18:38.526
So, family good, Steve?

18:38.559 --> 18:39.593
Yeah, all good here.

18:39.627 --> 18:42.096
- Yeah.
- Can't complain.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.534
Here we go.

19:00.716 --> 19:01.817
John Morgan.

19:03.486 --> 19:04.420
Damien.

19:05.923 --> 19:07.424
Long time.

19:07.457 --> 19:09.426
Oh, yes, a long time.

19:10.928 --> 19:12.729
You look well.

19:12.763 --> 19:16.132
All that Turkish sun must be
doing you a world of good.

19:16.165 --> 19:18.603
Can't complain.

19:18.636 --> 19:22.640
Yet here you are, back
in the cold wet and gray.

19:25.677 --> 19:28.278
Business is business, Damien.

19:30.816 --> 19:31.784
It is.

19:33.284 --> 19:35.654
It is, indeed.

19:40.859 --> 19:41.828
No.

19:51.571 --> 19:52.639
Nonsense.

19:55.476 --> 19:56.577
Why not?

20:02.450 --> 20:03.517
Just one.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.723
No more, no less,

20:07.756 --> 20:10.492
than ruin it with excess.

20:10.525 --> 20:13.629
Just a little rule I live by.

20:13.662 --> 20:16.665
We've never played
by the rules, Damien.

20:19.535 --> 20:22.605
People like you and me,
well, we're survivors.

20:24.407 --> 20:25.742
True.

20:25.775 --> 20:27.877
You've managed to keep
your head above water

20:27.910 --> 20:30.514
for a long, long time.

20:30.547 --> 20:33.817
But how long can you survive?

20:34.685 --> 20:36.754
What do you mean by that?

20:36.787 --> 20:39.523
Well, ask yourself.

20:39.556 --> 20:41.358
Why are you here with me now

20:41.392 --> 20:43.928
just one day after you
return to the city?

20:45.229 --> 20:46.330
My city.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.467
That I invite you here.

20:49.501 --> 20:50.702
Ah.

20:50.735 --> 20:53.673
So this was an invite, right?

20:55.641 --> 20:58.209
You consider yourself
a rule breaker,

20:58.243 --> 21:00.413
which is fine.

21:00.446 --> 21:03.616
Fine until you break my rules.

21:03.649 --> 21:05.284
Ah, your rules?

21:08.989 --> 21:10.657
How can I put this?

21:14.494 --> 21:16.596
You're making
a lot of noise, John.

21:18.499 --> 21:20.001
Noise? Yeah?

21:21.769 --> 21:24.939
You should know more than most,

21:24.972 --> 21:27.374
noise is no good.

21:27.407 --> 21:29.511
Any noise in our business.

21:31.947 --> 21:35.818
Was reading an
interesting article today.

21:38.487 --> 21:40.354
It's not a problem.

21:40.388 --> 21:43.560
Just some drunk tryin' to
make a name for himself

21:43.593 --> 21:45.360
at my expense, that's all.

21:45.394 --> 21:47.296
No doubt.

21:47.329 --> 21:50.500
But it's noise none the less.

21:50.533 --> 21:53.571
So what I need you to do is,

21:53.604 --> 21:55.806
lower the volume.

21:57.541 --> 21:59.543
It's nothing, Damien.

21:59.577 --> 22:00.945
In a few days

22:00.978 --> 22:03.346
I'll be out of
the country again,

22:03.379 --> 22:05.617
and that piece of
scum can go back

22:05.650 --> 22:08.720
doing what it he does

22:08.754 --> 22:10.989
when he's not pissed up
and chasing me around London.

22:13.725 --> 22:16.896
Things are quieter
when you're overseas.

22:17.830 --> 22:19.632
Perhaps you should stay there.

22:21.567 --> 22:24.737
All that golden sand
beneath your feet.

22:26.672 --> 22:29.443
Fresh sea air
filling your lungs.

22:30.677 --> 22:34.448
Nice place to retire.

22:34.481 --> 22:37.751
I'll retire when
I fucking want to.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.690
And there it is.

22:42.724 --> 22:45.059
The fire in you
hasn't died, has it?

22:45.093 --> 22:47.327
No chance, no chance at all.

22:47.361 --> 22:49.063
I like you, John.

22:49.097 --> 22:50.330
Always have.

22:51.432 --> 22:53.936
There's something
classic about you,

22:53.969 --> 22:55.905
like a...

22:55.938 --> 22:58.574
Victorian British bulldog.

22:58.607 --> 23:01.644
Proud, defiant, tenacious.

23:01.677 --> 23:02.711
Old school.

23:04.781 --> 23:08.485
But there comes a time
in any animal's life

23:10.487 --> 23:12.455
when it needs to be put down.

23:13.557 --> 23:16.694
So will it do
the honourable thing?

23:16.727 --> 23:19.362
Know when the time is right

23:19.396 --> 23:22.834
and find a nice, quiet place

23:24.068 --> 23:25.436
to die.

23:25.469 --> 23:27.872
I'm not dead yet, Damien.

23:27.905 --> 23:30.576
No, you're not.

23:30.609 --> 23:31.643
Yet.

23:34.179 --> 23:38.784
I've built up a nice collection
of thinly veiled threats

23:38.817 --> 23:41.054
from you over the years,

23:41.087 --> 23:42.422
but I think

23:43.556 --> 23:45.558
enough is enough.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.593
Threats?

23:46.626 --> 23:47.560
Threats.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.529
How long we've known each other?

23:49.562 --> 23:50.763
Please.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.501
I'm merely reminding you

23:54.535 --> 23:56.737
of the thin thread,

23:57.638 --> 23:59.807
like the weave of a spider,

23:59.840 --> 24:02.676
that I afford you to hang on by.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.949
It doesn't matter
whether I'm here

24:07.983 --> 24:09.951
or in fucking Timbuktu.

24:10.952 --> 24:11.920
London

24:13.021 --> 24:14.456
is my home.

24:14.489 --> 24:15.557
Always will be.

24:15.590 --> 24:17.226
Ah.

24:17.260 --> 24:20.730
An Englishman's home
is his castle.

24:20.763 --> 24:21.731
Got it.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.734
As long as he lives in it.

24:27.770 --> 24:28.939
Your defences are gone.

24:28.972 --> 24:30.707
Your drawbridge is down.

24:30.741 --> 24:32.242
You've been taken over.

24:32.276 --> 24:34.044
And your queen.

24:34.077 --> 24:36.813
How is Sadie, by the way?

24:38.815 --> 24:41.486
My wife is fucking okay.

24:41.519 --> 24:43.187
What's she got to do with it?

24:43.221 --> 24:45.857
I have proved my worth.

24:47.558 --> 24:49.460
The money.

24:49.494 --> 24:50.595
The money's good.

24:50.628 --> 24:52.163
Yeah.

24:52.196 --> 24:53.832
It really is.

24:54.867 --> 24:56.735
But this business of yours,

24:57.703 --> 25:00.005
buying, selling,

25:00.039 --> 25:01.540
moving

25:03.142 --> 25:04.945
merchandise.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.982
It's so barbaric.

25:09.015 --> 25:10.550
Unrefined, archaic.

25:10.583 --> 25:11.818
You're a relic, John.

25:12.752 --> 25:13.887
A dinosaur.

25:15.221 --> 25:16.857
My other businesses are

25:17.825 --> 25:21.028
so much more sophisticated.

25:21.062 --> 25:25.232
Computers, the dark web
lined with silk.

25:26.634 --> 25:29.504
Times have changed.

25:29.538 --> 25:32.741
Even a business as unique
as ours has had to adapt.

25:35.143 --> 25:37.713
Something needs to change, John.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.117
Do you adapt or perish?

25:42.618 --> 25:45.888
You don't fucking
seem to complain much

25:45.922 --> 25:48.524
when the money hits fucking
your bank account

25:48.558 --> 25:50.727
and you start
countin' it, does it?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.796
You're a good earner, yes.

25:54.765 --> 25:57.034
But stubborn, like Churchill.

26:09.014 --> 26:10.615
I've gotta be somewhere.

26:11.816 --> 26:14.953
So, are we done here, my friend?

26:14.986 --> 26:15.987
Very well.

26:17.356 --> 26:18.324
Adapt

26:19.191 --> 26:20.259
or perish.

26:22.661 --> 26:23.696
I'll see you later.

26:28.702 --> 26:29.669
John.

26:30.404 --> 26:32.105
Janet.

26:32.139 --> 26:33.340
Long time no see.

26:33.373 --> 26:36.043
And you're looking fabulous.

26:36.076 --> 26:37.778
How are you?

26:37.811 --> 26:39.112
All right.

26:39.146 --> 26:40.113
I suppose.

26:40.147 --> 26:42.050
Yeah? Good.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.752
Um, so, can we come in?

26:44.786 --> 26:46.087
Is Richie around?

26:51.659 --> 26:52.628
Thank you.

26:53.729 --> 26:54.630
You look lovely.

26:54.663 --> 26:55.831
Richie.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.733
Hi.

26:59.735 --> 27:00.669
Richie.

27:02.638 --> 27:03.372
How you been?

27:03.405 --> 27:04.874
Hey, could be better.

27:04.908 --> 27:07.010
Yeah, or next week.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.611
Yes, you're right.

27:08.645 --> 27:11.047
Oh, I see you brought
your guard dog with ya.

27:11.081 --> 27:13.083
Richie, please.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.720
Sit down and make
yourself comfortable.

27:16.754 --> 27:17.822
- Babe?
- Yeah?

27:17.855 --> 27:19.156
Put a kettle on, please?

27:19.190 --> 27:20.191
A what?

27:20.224 --> 27:21.358
A kettle on, please.

27:21.392 --> 27:22.359
You do it.

27:22.393 --> 27:23.427
It's your bloody brother.

27:26.097 --> 27:29.201
You, um, said you
wanted to speak to me.

27:31.269 --> 27:35.040
I see you had some shit on
the TV with Frank Conway.

27:36.141 --> 27:38.310
I could double up on that prick.

27:38.343 --> 27:40.378
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:40.412 --> 27:42.381
You know, I gotta be
sure mum's the word,

27:42.415 --> 27:45.284
as someone tipped him off
about you coming back to play.

27:45.318 --> 27:46.285
Mmm.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.455
Yeah, that's the easy bit.

27:48.489 --> 27:50.890
The difficult bit
is knowing who.

27:50.923 --> 27:51.891
Hmm?

27:51.924 --> 27:54.094
If you don't, John, you know.

27:54.128 --> 27:56.997
And you know.

27:57.030 --> 27:57.965
I know.

27:57.998 --> 27:58.899
Well, come on.

27:58.932 --> 28:00.468
Don't keep me in suspense.

28:00.502 --> 28:01.802
Tell me.

28:01.835 --> 28:02.803
Mickey Dean.

28:04.037 --> 28:04.873
That little shit?

28:04.906 --> 28:06.307
Are you sure?

28:06.341 --> 28:07.775
Abso-fucking-lutely.

28:07.809 --> 28:10.178
What the fuck is he
doing rattin' me out

28:10.211 --> 28:13.148
to fucking Conway?

28:13.181 --> 28:15.917
I have no idea, John, but I'm
sure you're gonna find out.

28:15.950 --> 28:17.253
If this lump keeps
talkin' about...

28:17.286 --> 28:18.220
No, hold on.

28:18.254 --> 28:19.321
Let's fuckin' do him, John.

28:19.355 --> 28:21.257
- Please, hold on, no.
- John.

28:21.290 --> 28:24.226
Yes, you're right, but I
need to say something else,

28:25.529 --> 28:27.229
and it involves the pair of you.

28:31.469 --> 28:35.438
Look, I'm thinking
about jacking it all in.

28:35.473 --> 28:36.907
What?

28:36.940 --> 28:37.974
Yeah.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.442
Retirement.

28:39.477 --> 28:41.445
You retire?
That'll be the day.

28:42.413 --> 28:43.848
I'm serious, Rich.

28:45.416 --> 28:46.918
Always thought you'd be
the act that they had

28:46.951 --> 28:49.488
to drag off the stage,
kickin' and fightin'.

28:50.455 --> 28:53.225
Well, it's not set in stone,

28:53.258 --> 28:54.726
but I am considering it.

28:56.295 --> 28:57.329
What about the business?

28:57.362 --> 28:59.298
Hey, that's per usual.

28:59.331 --> 29:02.334
Damien Osborne's not gonna
be wantin' to give up

29:02.367 --> 29:04.737
his bit of the action, but,

29:05.905 --> 29:09.042
well, there's gonna
have to be changes.

29:09.075 --> 29:10.376
Changes?

29:10.410 --> 29:14.013
Yeah, well, let's call
it a facelift, yeah?

29:14.047 --> 29:16.149
If I do go through with it,

29:19.353 --> 29:20.154
I need,

29:22.056 --> 29:24.158
I need you two to
be working together.

29:25.259 --> 29:26.160
No fucking way.

29:26.193 --> 29:27.428
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

29:27.462 --> 29:30.966
50-50, down the middle,
no exceptions.

29:33.235 --> 29:35.270
That ain't gonna
fuckin' happen, John.

29:35.303 --> 29:37.439
Richie, you're my brother.

29:37.473 --> 29:41.310
And Eddie, since your mum died,

29:41.344 --> 29:43.412
you've been like a son to me.

29:43.446 --> 29:46.015
Yeah, except that he's not
your fucking son, John, is he?

29:46.048 --> 29:47.216
Richie.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.186
Listen, he's a
little fuckin' prick

29:50.219 --> 29:51.354
and he's a liability.

29:51.387 --> 29:52.457
I'm a liability?

29:52.490 --> 29:53.491
I'm a liability?

29:53.524 --> 29:54.825
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

29:54.858 --> 29:55.859
John, he's a fucking old magpie.

29:55.892 --> 29:57.361
- Do me a favour.
- He's a mug.

29:57.394 --> 29:59.396
Do yourself a favour,
do me a favour.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.499
Have a cigarette
out on the balcony.

30:01.532 --> 30:03.033
Calm down.

30:03.066 --> 30:04.503
I'll call you back
in a minute.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.937
You talk to me like that again,

30:05.970 --> 30:07.740
you'll be fucking
under the ground.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.577
Oh, yeah, do us all
a favour and jump off.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.345
Richie.

30:15.547 --> 30:19.385
Look, I need you to get
your head around this,

30:19.418 --> 30:21.488
'cause if I go ahead with this

30:21.521 --> 30:23.155
and I jack it in,

30:23.188 --> 30:25.858
I need to know that you're
gonna be cool with Eddie.

30:27.860 --> 30:31.197
John, I just don't see
what you see in this kid.

30:31.231 --> 30:32.399
Listen to me.

30:32.432 --> 30:34.367
The business needs a shakeup.

30:34.401 --> 30:36.537
A complete shakeup.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.405
Look at me.

30:38.438 --> 30:41.543
I haven't exactly got
time on my side anymore.

30:44.479 --> 30:46.447
I feel the kid's
a fucking liability,

30:46.481 --> 30:47.948
but if that's the way
you want it to be,

30:47.982 --> 30:49.083
then that's the way it is.

30:49.116 --> 30:50.418
Yeah, it's the way
I want it to be,

30:50.451 --> 30:52.387
but at the moment I
haven't got any time

30:52.421 --> 30:54.122
to go through this.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.157
Think about it.

30:56.459 --> 30:57.560
I'll think about it.

30:58.927 --> 30:59.662
What about tomorrow?

30:59.696 --> 31:00.530
We still on for tomorrow?

31:00.563 --> 31:01.464
Yeah, yeah, of course.

31:01.497 --> 31:03.432
It'll be fun.

31:03.466 --> 31:05.968
I need one more promise
from you, though.

31:06.969 --> 31:08.572
Go on.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.375
When you see Sadie and Kate,

31:12.408 --> 31:15.044
you don't mention this at all,

31:15.078 --> 31:17.081
'cause it has to come from me.

31:17.114 --> 31:18.148
It's personal.

31:20.250 --> 31:21.218
It's done.

31:27.424 --> 31:28.426
See you tomorrow.

31:28.461 --> 31:29.562
Yeah.

31:29.595 --> 31:30.929
You will.

31:30.962 --> 31:32.163
Eddie, let's go.

31:32.197 --> 31:33.998
Put that fag out.

31:34.032 --> 31:34.966
Comin'.

31:37.135 --> 31:38.537
You're a rats.

31:50.216 --> 31:52.386
Get over here,
you fucking silly cunt.

31:52.419 --> 31:54.287
Get out there! Get out there!

31:54.321 --> 31:55.523
Fucking grub!

31:55.556 --> 31:56.524
Shut your fucking!

31:56.557 --> 31:57.525
You want another one right here?

31:58.760 --> 32:00.595
Get over there, you cunt!

32:00.628 --> 32:02.028
Get over there!

32:02.062 --> 32:03.930
Eddie, that's enough.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.967
That's enough.

32:08.570 --> 32:10.238
Well, he didn't waste
any time, did he?

32:10.271 --> 32:13.207
For a fucking grass
young sandwich.

32:19.281 --> 32:21.049
I think you went a
little bit over the top,

32:21.083 --> 32:22.317
don't you, Mickey?

32:22.351 --> 32:24.521
I got a bit excited, John.
I'm sorry, mate.

32:24.554 --> 32:26.723
It's not me you should
be apologizing to, Eddie.

32:26.756 --> 32:28.391
Yeah, I'm gonna show 'em it.

32:28.425 --> 32:30.628
You're fucking sorry,
you fucking grass.

32:33.463 --> 32:35.533
You all right?

32:35.566 --> 32:37.100
Listen, you're
gonna be all right.

32:37.133 --> 32:38.301
Just lean back.

32:38.334 --> 32:40.639
Lean back, relax.

32:40.672 --> 32:42.273
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:42.306 --> 32:43.642
He ain't here no more.

32:43.675 --> 32:46.343
You and me need to
have a little chat.

32:46.377 --> 32:47.344
Okay?

32:50.147 --> 32:53.519
Just answer a few of my
little questions, that's all.

32:53.553 --> 32:54.986
Okay.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.456
What have you been
tellin' Frank Conway?

32:57.490 --> 32:58.457
Nothing.

32:58.491 --> 33:00.125
Nothing, I'm not a fink.

33:00.158 --> 33:01.527
Honestly, John.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.798
Do you hear what I say, Mickey?

33:04.832 --> 33:09.570
Mickey, what have you
been telling Frank Conway?

33:10.471 --> 33:11.337
Nothing, nothing.

33:11.370 --> 33:12.673
Do you hear me, Mickey?

33:14.541 --> 33:16.008
Did he offer you money?

33:16.042 --> 33:17.244
I mean, it couldn't have
been a lot, could it?

33:17.277 --> 33:18.713
I mean, the fucker's skin.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.248
I got nothing.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.453
Mickey.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.558
Upsets me so much, you know.

33:30.526 --> 33:31.760
Hurts my heart.

33:33.529 --> 33:35.196
Trust.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.331
Do you know what trust is?

33:36.364 --> 33:38.801
Trust is the most
important thing

33:38.834 --> 33:41.370
that we have in our profession.

33:42.506 --> 33:45.675
Without that,
all we got, Mickey, eh?

33:45.709 --> 33:47.309
Is a fuck hole.

33:47.343 --> 33:48.645
Yuck.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.145
Nada.

33:50.179 --> 33:51.681
Nothing.

33:51.715 --> 33:54.251
John, come on, you can trust me.
You've always trusted me.

33:54.284 --> 33:56.386
Yes, yes, yes,
I have, yeah.

33:56.419 --> 33:58.054
But you've done right.

33:58.088 --> 34:00.290
And I must remember
to give myself a great, big,

34:00.323 --> 34:03.594
fat fuck off slap
on the wrist for doing that.

34:03.628 --> 34:04.763
You know that?

34:07.365 --> 34:08.299
Please.

34:09.166 --> 34:11.637
Please, I've got nothing.

34:11.670 --> 34:12.603
Please.

34:15.239 --> 34:16.275
Yeah.

34:17.342 --> 34:18.710
What?

34:18.745 --> 34:21.547
Oh, just put the seat belt on.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.683
Safety first, Mickey.

34:23.716 --> 34:26.284
In my firm,
it's always safety first.

34:26.318 --> 34:27.252
Got it?

34:28.154 --> 34:29.723
Where are we going?

34:30.623 --> 34:31.824
John? Please!

34:34.695 --> 34:36.429
John? No!

34:36.462 --> 34:38.899
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Not that, John!

34:38.933 --> 34:41.168
I love the smell of
this stuff, I do.

34:41.201 --> 34:42.469
No, no, John, please, no!

34:42.504 --> 34:43.469
John! John, no!

34:43.505 --> 34:45.907
No, please! Come on, please!

34:45.940 --> 34:47.474
John?

34:47.509 --> 34:48.743
John!

34:48.777 --> 34:50.545
Please, you gotta believe me!

34:52.514 --> 34:54.750
John, don't do this to me.

34:54.784 --> 34:56.752
Please, don't do
this to me, man.

34:56.786 --> 34:58.521
Come on. Please.

34:59.855 --> 35:01.657
John, don't leave me in here.

35:01.691 --> 35:04.460
John, please!

35:05.963 --> 35:08.130
What have I told you, Eddie?

35:08.164 --> 35:11.300
These things kill people.

35:11.334 --> 35:12.335
Oh, yeah.

35:13.770 --> 35:14.605
No, not that.

35:14.638 --> 35:15.772
Not that. No, please!

35:15.806 --> 35:16.774
Help!

35:16.808 --> 35:19.577
No, please don't leave me, John!

35:40.867 --> 35:43.503
Well, at least we're
only here for a few days.

35:43.536 --> 35:46.840
Yeah, well, I mean, it all
kicked off at the charity ball.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.240
John got into a fight.

35:48.273 --> 35:50.242
Eddie was bloody useless.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.544
So then we had to go
and see our lawyer

35:51.578 --> 35:54.815
to get an injunction
out on this stalker.

35:54.849 --> 35:56.951
Yeah, and then when we
left the lawyer's office,

35:56.984 --> 35:59.954
John was dragged off into
this car by God knows who.

36:00.855 --> 36:01.922
Bloody hate London.

36:01.956 --> 36:02.923
We should never have come back.

36:02.957 --> 36:05.527
It's so damn depressing.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.762
Yeah.

36:06.795 --> 36:08.362
Listen, sorry.

36:08.396 --> 36:09.898
Kate's at the door.
I gotta go.

36:09.931 --> 36:10.932
But listen, I'll
call you back, okay?

36:10.966 --> 36:12.534
I'm really sorry for venting.

36:13.401 --> 36:14.870
Okay, bye.

36:14.903 --> 36:18.407
Finally.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.910
I was beginning to think
we weren't having this lunch.

36:33.624 --> 36:34.825
Oh, thank God.

36:34.858 --> 36:36.794
You're meant to be
choosing my dress.

36:36.827 --> 36:38.227
Mrs. Morgan.

36:41.599 --> 36:42.767
I'm sorry.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.737
I'm, I'm Zoe, Kate's girlfriend.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.404
Oh, hi, Zoe.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.440
Um, sorry, I thought
you were Kate.

36:49.473 --> 36:52.410
We're supposed to
be going out and um,

36:52.444 --> 36:53.846
anyway, it's nice to meet you.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.313
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.516
She'd kill me if she
knew I'd stopped by.

36:57.550 --> 36:59.384
I was just on my way to
pick up a bottle of tipple

36:59.417 --> 37:00.853
for tomorrow night,
but didn't know what to get.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.924
Oh, well that's really sweet,
but not necessary.

37:03.957 --> 37:08.562
That's what Kate said,
but I kind of want to make a...

37:08.595 --> 37:10.030
A good impression?

37:10.063 --> 37:11.031
That's the one.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.767
Well, we're not fussy.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.970
Red or white, it'll get drunk.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.572
Okay, thank you.

37:17.605 --> 37:19.607
That makes things
easier then, I guess.

37:22.577 --> 37:23.978
I have to say, uh,

37:24.011 --> 37:26.814
this is a really great place
you've got, Mrs. Morgan.

37:26.848 --> 37:29.051
Kate's really lucky to have it
to herself when you're away.

37:30.119 --> 37:32.554
Oh, so you've been inside?

37:33.622 --> 37:35.023
Once or twice.

37:35.057 --> 37:38.359
Okay, oh, okay, well,
that makes sense.

37:39.828 --> 37:42.632
I gotta say,
that's one hell of an outfit.

37:43.633 --> 37:46.301
Hmm, well, thank you.
I think.

37:46.335 --> 37:49.539
You should just wear that
tomorrow night.

37:51.508 --> 37:53.544
That's Kate. She's on her way.

37:53.577 --> 37:54.812
Then I guess that's my cue.

37:54.845 --> 37:57.280
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, and you.

37:58.582 --> 38:00.316
See you tomorrow.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.542
- Really?
- What?

38:22.575 --> 38:24.010
Do your fans,
or whatever they're called,

38:24.043 --> 38:27.079
actually care about
what you have for lunch?

38:27.113 --> 38:28.682
You'd be surprised.

38:30.383 --> 38:32.351
I mean, it's work.

38:32.385 --> 38:33.687
But okay.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.856
Are you looking
forward to tomorrow?

38:35.889 --> 38:37.490
Nope.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.826
Why not?

38:38.859 --> 38:40.460
Do you remember the
first time you let Dad

38:40.494 --> 38:41.963
meet Granny and Granddad?

38:41.996 --> 38:43.665
Yeah, okay, point taken.

38:43.698 --> 38:44.933
It will be fine.

38:44.966 --> 38:47.569
I mean, Zoe seems,
I'm sure Zoe's lovely.

38:48.636 --> 38:50.905
I don't want it to be fine.

38:50.939 --> 38:52.440
I want it to be perfect.

38:52.473 --> 38:54.442
Your dad loves you
more than anything

38:54.475 --> 38:56.712
in this world, Kate.
You know that.

38:56.745 --> 38:59.480
If you really love
this girl, he'll see why.

39:01.584 --> 39:02.551
I hope so.

39:55.709 --> 39:57.544
Hi, Zoe. Come on up.

40:05.887 --> 40:06.855
Yup.

40:08.857 --> 40:09.991
Still there.

40:12.594 --> 40:13.929
Yeah.

40:13.962 --> 40:16.799
You do know I like to
keep you safe, don't you?

40:18.701 --> 40:21.070
I'm really nervous
for tonight, Dad,

40:21.103 --> 40:23.105
but I don't think it's
gonna be that bad.

40:25.675 --> 40:27.510
Kate? Zoe's here!

40:30.113 --> 40:31.581
Well, here goes nothing.

40:31.615 --> 40:34.251
I'll be down in
about a minute, okay?

40:35.986 --> 40:36.954
Okay.

40:39.723 --> 40:40.558
Hey.

40:40.591 --> 40:42.527
Hey.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.562
You okay?

40:44.595 --> 40:45.830
We'll soon find out.

40:52.938 --> 40:54.073
Hi, Zoe.

40:54.106 --> 40:55.174
It's great to meet you.

40:55.207 --> 40:56.141
Again.

40:56.175 --> 40:57.276
You look incredible.

40:59.278 --> 41:00.245
Oh, thank you.

41:00.279 --> 41:02.014
This is Eddie, Kate's cousin.

41:02.047 --> 41:02.881
Nice to meet ya.

41:02.915 --> 41:04.050
Good to meet you, too.

41:04.084 --> 41:05.618
Oh, wait, am I
missing something?

41:05.652 --> 41:07.287
Now leave me out of this one.
Come on, Eddie.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.521
Give us a hand in
the kitchen, will ya?

41:08.555 --> 41:10.757
Yeah, so, confession time.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.225
Ah, Zoe.

41:13.593 --> 41:14.995
Hello.

41:15.028 --> 41:16.664
Kate has told us
so much about you.

41:16.697 --> 41:18.966
It's so nice to meet
you after all this time.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.303
I'm Katie's Dad, John.

41:22.336 --> 41:23.704
Mr. Morgan.

41:23.738 --> 41:25.272
No, no, no, no.

41:25.306 --> 41:26.607
John.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.677
I'm cool with John.
It works for me.

41:28.710 --> 41:31.613
Well, John, these are for you.

41:31.646 --> 41:33.715
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

41:33.749 --> 41:34.983
They're not the best,
I'm afraid,

41:35.017 --> 41:36.084
but I'm sure they'll
get the job done.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.252
That's very generous, thank you.

41:37.285 --> 41:38.620
Oh.

41:38.653 --> 41:40.656
Uncle Rich and Auntie Janet.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.859
This should be interesting.

41:42.892 --> 41:43.860
Oh, really?

41:43.893 --> 41:45.762
- It's my brother.
- I see.

41:46.863 --> 41:48.197
How's my favourite niece?

41:48.231 --> 41:49.866
- Hello.
- Hi, darling.

41:49.899 --> 41:51.200
Why do we have to be late?

41:51.234 --> 41:52.369
If you listened to me
in the first place,

41:52.403 --> 41:54.805
we wouldn't be, would we?

41:54.838 --> 41:57.641
John, come here let me hug you.

41:57.674 --> 41:58.709
I'm good.

41:58.742 --> 42:00.077
What do you mean?

42:00.110 --> 42:00.978
See, once you realize
your old fucking man life

42:01.011 --> 42:02.546
is so much simpler.

42:03.715 --> 42:05.316
Is this your little lady friend?

42:05.350 --> 42:06.985
Yeah. Zoe.

42:08.653 --> 42:10.288
She's easy on
the eyes, isn't she?

42:10.321 --> 42:12.123
Sit your ass down.

42:14.893 --> 42:17.229
Hey, oh, this is
going to be fun.

42:17.263 --> 42:18.631
Fuck.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.099
Richard, behave
yourselves, will ya?

42:21.367 --> 42:22.334
Shall we?

42:25.738 --> 42:29.242
Well, that was
beautiful, darling.

42:29.276 --> 42:30.710
Thank you.

42:30.744 --> 42:33.080
You're welcome. Thank you.

42:33.113 --> 42:34.648
Thank you.

42:34.681 --> 42:37.651
Well, amazing chance for
us among uncooked food.

42:38.752 --> 42:40.621
Janet's allergic to the kitchen.

42:40.655 --> 42:43.624
And I'll be allergic to you
in the bedroom tonight, no?

42:44.859 --> 42:46.427
Well, you know,
kitchen's not always

42:46.461 --> 42:47.895
a woman's place, Richard.

42:47.929 --> 42:49.797
That depends on the woman,

42:49.831 --> 42:51.432
and the price of
her Jimmy Choo's.

42:51.466 --> 42:53.068
Depends on the man, too.

42:53.102 --> 42:54.336
Hmm, yeah, well said, Janet.

42:54.369 --> 42:56.338
Oh, I'm sure he's
only messing around.

42:56.371 --> 42:58.774
Yeah, well you haven't been
married to him for 15 years.

42:59.842 --> 43:01.410
Just having some fun.

43:01.443 --> 43:02.778
I mean, you've been yap, yap,
yap, yap, yappin' all night.

43:02.811 --> 43:04.447
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yapping.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.282
I mean, you're starting
to remind me of Eddie.

43:06.316 --> 43:08.351
Diggin' me again,
are you, Uncle?

43:08.384 --> 43:10.653
- Classy.
- Yeah, class.

43:10.687 --> 43:12.822
That is one word that I know
ain't in your dictionary.

43:12.856 --> 43:14.157
You can choke.

43:14.190 --> 43:15.458
What's wrong with this family?

43:15.492 --> 43:17.261
Has no one got
a sense of humour?

43:17.294 --> 43:18.395
Seriously?

43:18.429 --> 43:20.731
Richard.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.433
Come on, it's not the
Hare and Hound, Richard.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.034
Come on, we've got a guest.

43:24.068 --> 43:25.936
Don't worry
about me, Mrs. Morgan.

43:25.970 --> 43:28.740
But it is nice to know there's
a real woman at the table.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.043
Bullocks. She's no kid.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.813
Oi, she told you
to watch your mouth.

43:34.846 --> 43:36.114
Yeah, I heard what she said,

43:36.148 --> 43:38.450
but I don't need you
to repeat it, do I?

43:38.483 --> 43:40.186
Richard!

43:43.990 --> 43:46.125
What's got into you two?

43:46.159 --> 43:49.028
- Oh, he's not told you the news?
- Richard.

43:49.061 --> 43:50.463
He's not told you
about his big news?

43:50.496 --> 43:51.497
About his big plans?

43:51.532 --> 43:53.066
- What? No.
- Richard, no.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.134
His big plans
for the future.

43:54.168 --> 43:55.269
- What?
- He's not told you?

43:55.302 --> 43:57.337
About the master plan.

43:57.371 --> 43:59.873
If I were you, Richard,

43:59.907 --> 44:02.242
I'd think very carefully
about what your about to say.

44:02.276 --> 44:04.179
All right, brother?

44:04.212 --> 44:05.446
What?

44:05.480 --> 44:07.515
Think really, really
carefully about the fact

44:07.550 --> 44:08.716
that you're about to retire.

44:08.750 --> 44:09.717
What?

44:09.751 --> 44:11.252
Dad?

44:11.286 --> 44:13.121
I'm not retiring.

44:13.154 --> 44:15.523
Bullocks.

44:15.559 --> 44:17.760
Sorry, why am I only
hearing about this now?

44:19.862 --> 44:21.730
Nothing is set in stone.

44:21.764 --> 44:24.033
I'm just considering it.

44:24.066 --> 44:26.035
Keeping secrets from
your wife, John,

44:26.068 --> 44:28.305
is not the key to
a happy marriage.

44:28.338 --> 44:29.206
What?

44:29.239 --> 44:30.173
Fucking idiot, Richard!

44:34.110 --> 44:36.947
- Sorry, John, Mr. Morgan.
- Can I just say something?

44:36.980 --> 44:39.416
I'm not gonna pretend to
know what's going on here,

44:39.449 --> 44:41.519
but what I do know is that
there's some real cheap,

44:41.553 --> 44:44.522
nasty wine in the kitchen
that's just begging to be drunk,

44:44.556 --> 44:47.325
so if you don't mind.

44:47.358 --> 44:48.759
I could use a hand.

44:48.793 --> 44:50.461
Good idea, Zoe.
Thank you very much.

44:50.494 --> 44:52.130
You prick.

44:56.969 --> 44:58.270
Nasty wine?

44:58.303 --> 45:00.739
Hmm, that should
compliment the company.

45:07.213 --> 45:08.314
Thank you, Zoe.

45:08.348 --> 45:10.016
You're welcome.

45:10.049 --> 45:13.353
Well, you might find it ironic,

45:13.386 --> 45:15.054
but shall we have a toast?

45:15.088 --> 45:16.223
We should.

45:17.191 --> 45:18.325
To family.

45:19.226 --> 45:20.794
- To family.
- Family.

45:20.828 --> 45:23.864
To family and all
it's fucked upness.

45:25.533 --> 45:28.036
Oh, and to Zoe, our new friend.

45:29.037 --> 45:31.072
And her wonderful cheap wine.

45:32.173 --> 45:33.441
My pleasure.

45:33.475 --> 45:35.410
Mmm, ghastly.

45:35.443 --> 45:36.845
It's absolutely lovely.

45:38.513 --> 45:41.317
I'd still rather
have a gin and tonic.

45:41.350 --> 45:42.918
Nice, Janet.

45:49.358 --> 45:50.326
Um.

45:54.264 --> 45:57.234
Well, it really has
been quite an evening.

45:57.267 --> 45:58.835
Fuck.

46:01.471 --> 46:02.839
Katie. Sadie.

46:15.119 --> 46:16.522
Night, brother.

46:20.025 --> 46:21.927
Guess it was quiet nasty wine.

46:30.503 --> 46:32.939
For a second I didn't
see that comin'.

46:46.655 --> 46:47.589
Evenin'.

46:50.291 --> 46:52.928
Scotch on the rocks, please.

47:00.168 --> 47:01.870
Cold one tonight, eh?

47:07.711 --> 47:08.679
Yeah.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.615
Busy day?

47:14.050 --> 47:15.218
Always. You?

47:17.187 --> 47:18.623
Always.

47:18.656 --> 47:19.990
Snowed under tonight.

47:22.025 --> 47:25.929
Eh, we, um, don't
normally get new faces

47:25.963 --> 47:27.331
in this time of night.

47:29.134 --> 47:31.570
Maybe I'm not a new face.

47:31.604 --> 47:34.339
Maybe I'm an old face
from a long time ago.

47:36.341 --> 47:37.409
Oh, yeah?

47:39.512 --> 47:43.516
You, uh, you do look
sort of familiar, though.

47:45.284 --> 47:47.286
I used to come in
here with my dad

47:48.454 --> 47:51.223
when I was younger.
It was his, uh,

47:51.257 --> 47:52.727
regular

47:53.795 --> 47:56.396
before it changed.

47:56.430 --> 47:58.699
He passed away and,

48:00.467 --> 48:02.703
do you know, I don't think
I've been in here since?

48:06.474 --> 48:08.309
I'm sorry to hear that.

48:08.342 --> 48:10.511
Oh, it was a long time ago.

48:10.546 --> 48:11.647
Copper.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.481
He was a copper.

48:13.514 --> 48:16.553
Same as me, as I was.

48:21.190 --> 48:22.625
You're dad was a copper?

48:22.659 --> 48:24.561
Yes.

48:24.594 --> 48:25.427
I think I've got it.

48:25.461 --> 48:27.129
Conway.

48:28.398 --> 48:30.533
You're Alfie Conway's boy.

48:30.568 --> 48:32.168
You're wrapping me on, Billy.

48:32.202 --> 48:33.036
Frank.

48:33.069 --> 48:34.672
Yeah, lovely to meet ya.

48:35.673 --> 48:37.440
Oh, bloody hell.

48:38.541 --> 48:39.678
Alfie Conway.

48:41.412 --> 48:43.582
I remember him, mate.

48:43.615 --> 48:45.516
Is there, uh,

48:45.550 --> 48:47.619
car accident, yeah?

48:47.652 --> 48:49.019
Wasn't an accident.

48:50.822 --> 48:53.291
I'm sorry, it's a long story.

48:53.325 --> 48:54.760
It's a bit of a horror story.

48:56.596 --> 48:59.364
Still, I suppose you've
had a few of those in here

48:59.397 --> 49:01.433
over the years, eh?

49:01.466 --> 49:04.070
It's the East End, mate.
It's nonstop.

49:04.103 --> 49:06.405
Everyone around here has
got a tall tale to tell

49:06.439 --> 49:08.441
about the old gangsters.

49:08.474 --> 49:11.578
I've heard 'em all
a thousand times.

49:11.612 --> 49:14.180
The blood, the guts, the glory.

49:15.549 --> 49:17.217
They say there's no
cool gangsters anymore.

49:17.251 --> 49:18.485
It's OC.

49:18.519 --> 49:20.187
Organized crime, sir.

49:20.220 --> 49:23.223
They have factories, pay wages.

49:23.257 --> 49:26.594
Top up your fucking
pension plan, probably.

49:26.628 --> 49:28.664
And nine out of 10 of
them have got bent coppers

49:28.697 --> 49:32.768
on the payrolls, so that's
your gangsters now.

49:35.571 --> 49:36.739
Yeah, you're right.

49:37.740 --> 49:39.508
Times have certainly changed.

49:55.525 --> 49:56.761
Dad?

49:56.794 --> 49:58.295
Dad, wake up!

50:01.666 --> 50:02.800
John?

50:05.303 --> 50:06.270
Dad!

50:09.340 --> 50:11.777
Well, hell must be empty,

50:11.810 --> 50:13.679
'cause all of
the devils are here.

50:14.545 --> 50:15.682
Katie.

50:17.416 --> 50:19.284
Sadie, you okay?

50:19.318 --> 50:21.086
You're both great, right?

50:22.655 --> 50:23.590
For now.

50:24.523 --> 50:26.391
Zoe?

50:26.425 --> 50:27.761
A good kid, did you, brother?

50:27.795 --> 50:28.829
Hmm?

50:32.900 --> 50:35.535
Richard, what is this?

50:35.569 --> 50:39.239
John, I know you always like
the sound of your own voice,

50:39.273 --> 50:42.744
but please, please,
please, just this once

50:42.777 --> 50:44.913
shut the fuck up.

50:44.946 --> 50:48.515
Tell me what the fuck's
going on, Richard!

50:48.549 --> 50:49.818
You bastard.

50:50.885 --> 50:52.320
Hi, honey bunny.

50:53.321 --> 50:56.257
Richie, cut all this bullocks

50:56.291 --> 50:58.694
and tell me what this
is about, will ya?

50:58.728 --> 51:00.462
I want some information.

51:00.495 --> 51:01.463
Information?

51:01.496 --> 51:02.364
Yeah.

51:02.397 --> 51:03.800
Have a look around you.

51:03.834 --> 51:05.501
You aren't in the
position to make demands,

51:05.534 --> 51:06.903
are you, brother?

51:10.707 --> 51:11.808
See, you're in my home.

51:11.842 --> 51:12.909
It was Windsor Castle.

51:12.943 --> 51:14.343
West fourth elms...

51:14.377 --> 51:15.713
I mean, castles crumble.

51:16.648 --> 51:17.615
Fuck you.

51:18.583 --> 51:20.484
Tell us what you want!

51:23.553 --> 51:24.922
It's not what I want.

51:24.956 --> 51:28.292
It's about what I deserve.

51:29.427 --> 51:30.629
And you, brother,

51:30.663 --> 51:32.598
you're gonna get exactly
what you deserve.

51:37.036 --> 51:39.004
In these old stories
you used to hear

51:39.038 --> 51:41.407
I don't suppose
anyone ever mentioned

51:41.440 --> 51:42.809
John Morgan, did they?

51:45.712 --> 51:46.780
Should they have?

51:47.714 --> 51:48.682
Probably not.

51:48.715 --> 51:50.150
He was a right, slippery cunt.

51:53.486 --> 51:55.288
He's just another

51:55.321 --> 51:57.390
self-serving little shit

51:57.424 --> 51:59.627
on the wrong side of the law.

51:59.660 --> 52:02.529
Your old man put a few of those
away in his time, I tell ya.

52:02.562 --> 52:04.398
Yes, he did.

52:04.432 --> 52:05.767
He did, Billy.

52:08.302 --> 52:09.604
But not Morgan.

52:14.710 --> 52:16.946
You know, that was Dad's karma.

52:19.816 --> 52:21.684
You see, the day he died I was,

52:21.718 --> 52:24.620
I was visiting a friend
down on the coast.

52:24.654 --> 52:26.689
I got a train back into town.

52:26.723 --> 52:28.391
There was a train
stuck or something,

52:28.424 --> 52:32.596
so my old man picked me up
from King's Cross off-duty.

52:33.864 --> 52:35.933
Go and paint the van, son.
You on it...

52:35.966 --> 52:39.604
and the next thing I know
this car speeds past us

52:39.637 --> 52:41.706
90 miles an hour,
Pentonville Road,

52:41.740 --> 52:44.508
no fucking plates,
someone's done a job.

52:46.845 --> 52:48.479
It's Morgan.

52:48.512 --> 52:49.647
I could see him.

52:49.681 --> 52:50.648
Crystal clear.

52:50.682 --> 52:51.951
So my dad's in pursuit,

52:51.984 --> 52:54.385
we're going in and
out of traffic, and...

52:54.419 --> 52:55.588
Christ.

52:55.621 --> 52:56.689
Christ.

52:56.722 --> 52:58.791
Yeah, yeah.

52:58.824 --> 53:01.861
So, uh, you were
in there with him?

53:04.064 --> 53:05.832
Well, I was lucky.

53:07.734 --> 53:09.102
Not as lucky as Morgan, though.

53:09.136 --> 53:11.671
CPS said that my testament,
he wouldn't stand.

53:11.705 --> 53:15.076
You know, severe concussion,
emotional trauma, all that.

53:16.476 --> 53:18.345
So he got away with that one.

53:23.584 --> 53:26.621
So, why now?

53:28.090 --> 53:29.858
Why what?

53:29.892 --> 53:31.459
What made you come here?

53:37.065 --> 53:39.102
Just, just felt right.

53:43.606 --> 53:48.310
So, you're on the force like
your dad used to be, yeah?

53:53.918 --> 53:55.619
Up until very recently.

53:57.188 --> 53:58.689
What happened?

54:00.624 --> 54:02.092
This happened.

54:03.762 --> 54:05.563
It's true what they say.

54:05.597 --> 54:07.999
The apple didn't fall too
far from the tree then.

54:09.601 --> 54:12.369
Your old man, he, um,

54:12.403 --> 54:14.639
he wasn't perfect
by a long shot,

54:14.673 --> 54:16.541
but he had a good heart

54:16.576 --> 54:19.979
and he always, always tried
to do the right thing,

54:21.113 --> 54:22.815
especially for his family.

54:24.784 --> 54:27.087
Well, Morgan
destroyed my family,

54:28.889 --> 54:30.724
but I'll tell you
something ironic.

54:33.193 --> 54:36.462
His family don't give
a fuck about him.

54:38.932 --> 54:40.635
All the years I was on the Met,

54:40.668 --> 54:42.070
no one go after him.

54:42.103 --> 54:43.938
"Oh, he's out of our
jurisdiction," they'd say.

54:43.972 --> 54:45.505
He's in another country.

54:45.539 --> 54:47.574
Well, there's nothing
we can do, Frank."

54:47.609 --> 54:51.046
So I decided that
I would do something,

54:51.080 --> 54:54.116
that I would find something
and take something

54:54.149 --> 54:57.119
to them that they couldn't
ignore or cover up.

54:57.987 --> 55:00.656
And I did it.

55:00.689 --> 55:02.523
I found someone who would talk,

55:02.557 --> 55:04.828
but not just talk,
sing like a choir boy,

55:04.861 --> 55:06.963
wax fucking lyrical.

55:06.997 --> 55:09.065
And do you know who
that person was?

55:09.099 --> 55:10.066
Go on.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.069
His own brother.

55:14.871 --> 55:18.643
How about that for a
happy fucking family?

55:20.144 --> 55:22.647
Richard, please.

55:23.948 --> 55:24.916
Love.

55:25.850 --> 55:27.920
Think about what you're doing.

55:27.953 --> 55:29.955
Well, I thought
about what I'm doing,

55:29.988 --> 55:32.925
and the problem is,
heaven doesn't want me.

55:32.958 --> 55:36.028
But the devil's not
done with me yet.

55:36.061 --> 55:38.998
Richard, if this is
about you and me,

55:39.032 --> 55:40.633
leave them out of it.

55:43.903 --> 55:46.172
Oh, John, you picked
a fucking fine time

55:46.205 --> 55:47.707
to start being noble.

55:47.740 --> 55:49.208
Because you're right.

55:49.242 --> 55:51.845
It's about me and you,

55:51.879 --> 55:53.213
and that little cunt.

55:54.615 --> 55:56.817
What have you done now,
you sloppy cunt?

55:56.850 --> 55:57.685
Eddie.

55:57.718 --> 55:59.119
See, here we go again.

55:59.153 --> 56:02.756
John, it's yap, yap, yap,
yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

56:02.790 --> 56:04.491
Yap.

56:04.525 --> 56:05.492
Yap.

56:10.198 --> 56:11.766
Richard.

56:11.800 --> 56:12.734
Please.

56:12.767 --> 56:14.202
Richard!

56:15.938 --> 56:18.207
What you gonna do, eh?

56:18.240 --> 56:20.609
Covered by your
brother all your life.

56:21.844 --> 56:24.613
You're a fucking mug.

56:28.151 --> 56:32.089
Say hello to my sister,
your mother, in hell.

56:33.023 --> 56:35.592
You say I'll see her soon.

56:35.625 --> 56:36.827
See your mother soon.

56:38.896 --> 56:41.531
Richie, no!

56:54.747 --> 56:56.682
No one's going to help you.

56:57.716 --> 57:00.252
Please stop.

57:00.285 --> 57:01.987
Hey!

57:02.021 --> 57:04.324
Don't you fucking hit her again!

57:05.658 --> 57:06.893
Fuck you.

57:07.894 --> 57:09.829
You look like a piece of shit!

57:11.364 --> 57:12.832
I'm gonna kill you.

57:14.367 --> 57:15.336
Painfully.

57:16.370 --> 57:17.338
I promise.

57:18.773 --> 57:21.776
Oh, I'm trembling.

57:26.213 --> 57:29.151
The things I've done for you.

57:29.184 --> 57:30.919
The things you've done for me?

57:30.952 --> 57:33.221
Uh, apart from

57:33.255 --> 57:36.691
holding me back in
the business and in life,

57:36.725 --> 57:38.795
what the fuck have
you done for me?

57:38.828 --> 57:42.265
Is this your idea of
a power play then?

57:43.833 --> 57:45.868
Well, you're the one
that's tied up, brother.

57:45.902 --> 57:48.204
John, it's business.

57:48.237 --> 57:50.874
Sounds like you know
what you wanted then.

57:53.010 --> 57:54.344
I'm off the force.

57:56.847 --> 57:58.215
Who's gonna listen to me?

57:59.416 --> 58:02.319
Hey, only you, Billy.

58:04.422 --> 58:07.591
And my poor, old, dead dad
who's spinnin' in his grave.

58:10.462 --> 58:12.764
Tell you one thing.

58:12.797 --> 58:15.701
Your dad understood
more than most

58:17.269 --> 58:20.406
that the best way forward

58:20.439 --> 58:22.141
is to beat 'em at
their own game.

58:22.174 --> 58:23.909
Fight fire with fire.

58:23.943 --> 58:26.312
I haven't got any fire.

58:26.345 --> 58:28.915
I haven't got anything
to fight anyone with.

58:31.017 --> 58:32.819
I haven't got a badge anymore.

58:35.122 --> 58:37.224
Maybe.

58:37.257 --> 58:41.629
Or maybe you're exactly
where you need to be.

58:44.265 --> 58:45.766
How do you mean?

58:45.800 --> 58:48.703
So you wanna go off after
this Morgan character

58:48.736 --> 58:50.671
because it's the
right thing to do.

58:51.907 --> 58:53.041
Do it.

58:54.343 --> 58:56.345
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your job,

58:56.378 --> 58:58.714
but what's to stop you now?

58:59.715 --> 59:01.750
No red tape holding you back.

59:01.783 --> 59:04.053
No politics, no bureaucracy.

59:04.988 --> 59:06.189
No, no rules.

59:10.827 --> 59:12.195
Sometimes in life

59:14.497 --> 59:16.333
if you want to
catch the bad guy,

59:18.035 --> 59:20.371
you have to become the bad guy.

59:24.942 --> 59:26.110
This one's on me.

59:32.851 --> 59:34.319
Here you go, mate.

59:42.862 --> 59:45.298
Roping in this little bitch

59:45.331 --> 59:48.434
to help you with
your dirty fucking job,

59:51.838 --> 59:53.273
that's fucking pathetic!

59:54.241 --> 59:55.475
Watch your tongue, John.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.177
She might be slightly psychotic,

59:57.211 --> 59:58.478
but I think we make a good team.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.280
Hmm-hmm. Same.

01:00:01.215 --> 01:00:03.084
Look at you.

01:00:03.117 --> 01:00:04.485
Putting all this shit

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.754
on your own flesh and blood.

01:00:07.922 --> 01:00:09.490
- My family?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:10.959
My own flesh and blood?

01:00:10.992 --> 01:00:13.494
When did family ever
mean fuck all to ya?

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:15.965
I've always looked
out for my family.

01:00:15.998 --> 01:00:17.766
Always, even you!

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.235
Stood by your family?

01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:21.070
The only person you've
ever stood by is you, John.

01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:23.872
You're a selfish fucker.

01:00:23.906 --> 01:00:24.940
Yeah?

01:00:24.974 --> 01:00:27.544
Well face facts, Richie.

01:00:27.577 --> 01:00:30.146
This is way above
your pay grade.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.515
You know very well, like I do,

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:34.884
this is all gonna go tits up.

01:00:34.918 --> 01:00:37.887
So while you're in front,

01:00:37.921 --> 01:00:39.857
why don't you call it a day, eh?

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:43.561
That's a good lad.

01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:46.063
You called me pathetic?

01:00:46.097 --> 01:00:47.565
No, he's right.

01:00:47.598 --> 01:00:49.267
You are pathetic.

01:00:50.869 --> 01:00:52.404
Do you know,

01:00:52.437 --> 01:00:53.939
she disgusts me.

01:00:54.906 --> 01:00:57.209
She always disgusted me.

01:00:57.242 --> 01:00:58.944
Always.

01:00:58.977 --> 01:01:01.179
It's like, it's like, it's
like yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

01:01:01.213 --> 01:01:02.815
Yeah.

01:01:02.849 --> 01:01:04.417
Yap, yap, yap, yap,
fucking yap.

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.019
No!

01:01:06.052 --> 01:01:08.154
I think it's time to put
this to bed, don't you?

01:01:08.187 --> 01:01:09.822
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:01:09.856 --> 01:01:11.224
No!

01:01:17.898 --> 01:01:19.099
Richard.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.801
You fucking lunatic.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:24.138
So now do I have your attention?

01:01:25.439 --> 01:01:27.409
How does it finally
feel to be a position

01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:30.111
that you can't actually
talk yourself out of, hmm?

01:01:31.946 --> 01:01:33.915
Go on, untie me.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.954
John, you know I can't do that.

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:41.824
You're a fucking coward
is what you are.

01:01:42.992 --> 01:01:44.293
You bastard.

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:47.163
Christ, I just can't believe

01:01:47.196 --> 01:01:49.965
how fucking delusional you are.

01:01:49.999 --> 01:01:52.202
Really, I mean...

01:01:52.235 --> 01:01:54.971
I think I just gave you too
much credit over the years.

01:01:55.005 --> 01:01:57.574
You just gotta accept
that the end is near.

01:01:57.607 --> 01:01:59.076
It's like the song says.

01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:00.877
There's final curtains
and everything.

01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:02.947
Yeah, just get used to it.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.915
Yeah.

01:02:03.948 --> 01:02:05.316
It's gonna be a long night.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.618
At the end of the evening,

01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:08.886
I'll be pissing on your corpse.

01:02:11.189 --> 01:02:13.091
No, no, no, no, no, baby.

01:02:13.124 --> 01:02:14.694
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He's a fighter.

01:02:14.728 --> 01:02:17.363
- You've gotta give him that.
- Yes.

01:02:17.396 --> 01:02:22.901
Richie, if I just disappear,
people are gonna ask questions.

01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:26.305
John, no one's gonna give
a fuck if you disappear.

01:02:26.338 --> 01:02:29.109
London forgot about
you a long time ago.

01:02:29.142 --> 01:02:30.343
Really?

01:02:30.377 --> 01:02:32.078
What about Damien Osborne?

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.948
Damien?

01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:36.316
Damien?

01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:38.919
Damien doesn't give a
fuck who's running it,

01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:41.422
as long as he gets his cut.

01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:44.525
If I just disappear,
they will kill you.

01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:48.229
How about this for
a surprise, John?

01:02:48.262 --> 01:02:50.633
Maybe I've already done
a deal with Damien.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.968
If you believe that,

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:55.170
you're even more deluded
than I thought you were before.

01:02:57.272 --> 01:02:58.741
Here he goes again.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.209
Fucking old mouth,
from mouth, from frets,

01:03:01.243 --> 01:03:02.344
from mouth, from fucking frets.

01:03:02.377 --> 01:03:04.380
Oh, no, no, now
he fucking frets.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.753
You are fucking worthless!

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.187
Sadie!

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.724
You are fucking
worthless, Richard!

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:18.028
You always have been
and you always will be!

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.230
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:23.333
You tell that big mouth cunt
if she says one more word,

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.969
I will fucking kill even now.

01:03:32.377 --> 01:03:33.344
John.

01:03:34.546 --> 01:03:36.181
That was a mistake.

01:03:36.214 --> 01:03:38.149
That really was a mistake.

01:03:38.183 --> 01:03:40.386
Even tied to this chair,
I'm not as helpless

01:03:40.419 --> 01:03:42.154
as you fucking are.

01:03:42.188 --> 01:03:43.522
You prick.

01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:52.265
See now, I can't
decide how to kill her.

01:03:52.299 --> 01:03:55.803
Can't decide whether
to use the gun

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.774
or the glass.

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:02.543
Or the bottle.

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.278
John.

01:04:19.595 --> 01:04:24.399
You think that you
can fuck with me?

01:04:24.433 --> 01:04:26.704
You think you can
fuck with my family?

01:04:29.172 --> 01:04:32.008
The wolves are at
your door.

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.713
And now they're in your house.

01:04:41.452 --> 01:04:43.254
Now you have a choice.

01:04:44.588 --> 01:04:46.023
Drop the bottle

01:04:47.692 --> 01:04:48.660
or

01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:53.131
I will fuck you up.

01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:02.107
If you want to
catch the bad guy,

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:05.111
you have to become the bad guy.

01:06:10.414 --> 01:06:12.684
You get
the fuck off him.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.519
Dad, do something.

01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:16.756
It's all right, Katie.

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:18.490
It's gonna be all
right, I promise ya.

01:06:18.523 --> 01:06:20.660
The daughter first...

01:06:22.394 --> 01:06:24.897
You know, you are
gonna end up just like

01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:26.231
my fucking brother.

01:06:26.264 --> 01:06:27.701
I promise ya!

01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:30.236
Thanks for taking
care of him for me.

01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:33.506
Did you really think
we were partners?

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:36.944
I mean, I guess he did.

01:06:39.213 --> 01:06:40.915
Zoe, what is this about?

01:06:40.949 --> 01:06:43.517
- Please.
- What is this about?

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:45.987
Everything.

01:06:46.021 --> 01:06:47.321
Go on then.

01:06:47.354 --> 01:06:50.760
Take everything,
take what you want.

01:06:50.793 --> 01:06:52.862
But just leave my family alone.

01:06:52.895 --> 01:06:54.429
You think this
is a robbery now?

01:06:54.462 --> 01:06:55.798
What is it then?

01:06:55.831 --> 01:06:57.833
I guess not everything is
as it seems, Mr. Morgan.

01:06:57.867 --> 01:07:00.468
Why are you doing this, Zoe?

01:07:00.502 --> 01:07:01.837
Please.

01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:04.407
Oh, I'm sorry, Kate.
I just needed a way in.

01:07:05.508 --> 01:07:06.475
Zoe.

01:07:07.476 --> 01:07:09.345
Zoe, I'm sorry I'm cold.

01:07:09.378 --> 01:07:11.648
There is no Zoe.

01:07:11.682 --> 01:07:13.349
Well then who are you?

01:07:14.351 --> 01:07:15.920
Who are we?

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:17.454
That's a good question.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.925
You have no idea.

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:23.293
You have no idea how good
it is to see you back.

01:07:23.326 --> 01:07:24.561
Look, Zoe.

01:07:24.594 --> 01:07:27.032
Please, my wife and
my daughter, yeah?

01:07:27.066 --> 01:07:28.466
Just leave them alone?

01:07:32.905 --> 01:07:35.406
You know, in a way I
feel sorry for them.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.241
In a way they're victims, too.

01:07:37.275 --> 01:07:39.311
Just like me.

01:07:39.344 --> 01:07:40.680
Just like us.

01:07:40.714 --> 01:07:42.816
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:07:44.851 --> 01:07:47.053
That's all right, okay.

01:07:47.087 --> 01:07:50.423
You never told me your
mom was such a 10, Kate.

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:51.524
What are you?

01:07:51.558 --> 01:07:52.592
Pushing 50?

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.427
You look great.

01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:55.361
John.

01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:56.664
You're a lucky man, John.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:58.733
- Very lucky.
- No.

01:07:58.766 --> 01:07:59.934
Leave her alone!

01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:01.969
How does that feel,
Mrs. Morgan?

01:08:02.002 --> 01:08:04.238
You sick fuck!

01:08:05.107 --> 01:08:08.509
Oh, was that good, yeah?

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:10.011
Fucking take it!

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:12.279
Oh, Kate, are you lonely?

01:08:12.313 --> 01:08:13.614
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:17.452
- Mwah.
- She's brutal...

01:08:17.486 --> 01:08:19.520
You keep away from her.

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:21.023
Don't you fucking touch her!

01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:22.290
What the fuck are
you gonna do, John?

01:08:22.323 --> 01:08:23.859
It's a little late for that.

01:08:23.893 --> 01:08:25.493
You sick fuck.

01:08:25.527 --> 01:08:26.964
Oh, I'm the sick one?

01:08:26.997 --> 01:08:29.564
Hey, guys, John here
thinks I'm the sick one.

01:08:30.901 --> 01:08:35.872
Just shut up and get
to the point, please.

01:08:35.906 --> 01:08:37.540
Tell us who you are.

01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:38.943
What do you want?

01:08:38.977 --> 01:08:42.046
Oh, we are, we've got
many names, haven't we?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.849
Faceless, worthless,

01:08:44.883 --> 01:08:47.852
downtrodden, one percent.

01:08:47.886 --> 01:08:49.453
Play things of the rich.

01:08:49.486 --> 01:08:51.023
Used, abused,

01:08:51.055 --> 01:08:55.728
and after you're done,
cast aside like we're fuck toys.

01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:59.698
But now, now you are our toys.

01:08:59.732 --> 01:09:01.332
Our victims.

01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:02.568
You're fucking mad.

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:05.371
You are worthless.

01:09:05.404 --> 01:09:06.538
You bitch!

01:09:06.572 --> 01:09:08.942
Now, now, Kate.

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:11.377
Hey, hey.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.448
I bet your followers
are gettin' worried.

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.785
Kate...

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.787
You've not posted in
a couple of hours.

01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:23.057
Probably sending out
a search party, huh?

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:26.093
Why don't we give
them a little update?

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:29.965
Kate, do it for the Gram.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.366
There.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:33.367
Done.

01:09:33.401 --> 01:09:35.502
Another one for the freaks.

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:40.509
Kate, cheer up.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.078
At least you got your
mummy and daddy here

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.680
with you at the end.

01:09:45.647 --> 01:09:49.551
Now I wanna see you two do it.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.455
Yeah.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.622
Kiss.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:55.558
Go on.

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:57.661
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:58.696
Yeah.

01:09:58.729 --> 01:10:00.064
Got that, John, wouldn't you?

01:10:00.097 --> 01:10:01.665
You're a sick fuck.

01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:02.633
Come on.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.170
Kiss.

01:10:05.203 --> 01:10:06.403
Fuck you.

01:10:06.437 --> 01:10:08.073
I haven't got all fucking day.

01:10:08.974 --> 01:10:11.176
I don't ask twice.

01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:12.443
Leave them alone!

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:14.914
Kiss!

01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:18.617
Sick fucking cunt!

01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:19.785
Ooh!

01:10:19.819 --> 01:10:22.387
So much venom on
those lovely lips.

01:10:23.122 --> 01:10:24.223
I want to see more of that.

01:10:24.257 --> 01:10:25.490
Untie her.

01:10:25.523 --> 01:10:26.492
Yup. Yeah.

01:10:28.762 --> 01:10:30.563
What?

01:10:30.596 --> 01:10:32.398
Fucking cunt!

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.955
Feisty old bitch.

01:11:22.753 --> 01:11:24.255
No, no, please, stop it.

01:11:24.288 --> 01:11:25.856
Please.

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.094
Uh-oh.

01:11:29.127 --> 01:11:31.830
You're so protective
of your family.

01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:34.666
What about the others?

01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:37.703
Like me?

01:11:37.736 --> 01:11:38.905
Like us?

01:11:41.841 --> 01:11:43.142
What?

01:11:45.078 --> 01:11:46.846
All the other kids.

01:11:50.751 --> 01:11:51.785
What are you talkin' about?

01:11:51.819 --> 01:11:53.320
I thought you'd say that.

01:11:53.354 --> 01:11:55.889
Romania, Bulgaria,

01:11:55.923 --> 01:11:58.192
Serbia, Albania, Ukraine?

01:11:59.093 --> 01:12:01.261
Ring any bells?

01:12:01.295 --> 01:12:03.164
No.

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:04.565
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:04.598 --> 01:12:06.701
- I don't.
- Kids.

01:12:06.735 --> 01:12:08.535
We were just kids.

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.806
But that's never
stopped you, has it?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.842
Snatching up the poorest kids

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:16.679
from the poorest
families and selling them

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.082
to the highest bidders

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:21.984
to be used over

01:12:22.018 --> 01:12:24.619
and over and over again.

01:12:25.388 --> 01:12:28.058
Girls, boys.

01:12:28.091 --> 01:12:29.726
Didn't matter to you.

01:12:30.727 --> 01:12:33.096
Stolen all the same.

01:12:36.233 --> 01:12:39.170
- John?
- It's not true.

01:12:39.203 --> 01:12:41.139
I don't know what
she's talkin' about.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.142
History lesson, John.

01:12:45.043 --> 01:12:47.178
Let's go back 10 years.

01:12:47.211 --> 01:12:51.083
Yeah, we were chained up,
locked up, fucked up.

01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:54.787
We were beaten and raped
until we forgot who we were,

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.955
'til we knew nothing else,

01:12:57.856 --> 01:12:59.691
'til we lost ourselves.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.329
And you remember
that day clearer

01:13:03.363 --> 01:13:05.664
than I remember almost anything.

01:13:06.433 --> 01:13:08.634
The day we were freed.

01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:10.636
We were so weak.

01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:12.105
So tired.

01:13:13.239 --> 01:13:14.942
But we kept running.

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:16.343
We had to.

01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:19.080
No turning back.

01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:23.350
We got away, John.

01:13:23.384 --> 01:13:25.618
But not really

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:28.290
'cause every time
we close our eyes

01:13:30.692 --> 01:13:33.228
you're there,

01:13:33.261 --> 01:13:34.863
haunting us.

01:13:41.337 --> 01:13:44.073
You wanna know who I am?

01:13:44.107 --> 01:13:45.741
Just call me victim.

01:13:46.976 --> 01:13:48.878
That's all I'll ever
be thanks to you.

01:13:49.879 --> 01:13:53.851
Your victims.

01:13:53.884 --> 01:13:54.718
No.

01:13:54.751 --> 01:13:56.086
I never touched you.

01:13:56.987 --> 01:13:58.055
I never touched anyone.

01:13:58.088 --> 01:14:00.324
And that makes you innocent?

01:14:00.357 --> 01:14:02.293
You sold us, John.

01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:04.762
Sold us like fucking cattle.

01:14:05.997 --> 01:14:06.998
It was just business.

01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:08.833
It was just our lives.

01:14:10.869 --> 01:14:12.669
Dad?

01:14:12.704 --> 01:14:14.206
I don't have to listen to this.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.075
You're fucking insane.

01:14:17.776 --> 01:14:19.145
Maybe.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.149
But who could blame me?

01:14:23.182 --> 01:14:24.150
Just go.

01:14:24.183 --> 01:14:26.753
Just fucking go.

01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:30.891
After tonight,
whenever we close our eyes,

01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:32.726
you'll no longer be there.

01:14:34.728 --> 01:14:36.429
Took us a long time
to figure out

01:14:36.463 --> 01:14:38.332
what we needed to do.

01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:40.101
You'll all be gone.

01:14:40.134 --> 01:14:42.069
You, your family,

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:46.474
and everyone else involved
in your fucked up scheme.

01:14:46.507 --> 01:14:49.810
You think it's just us in
this room who want this?

01:14:51.079 --> 01:14:53.048
There's so many of us.

01:14:56.418 --> 01:14:59.454
Now I wanna know something.

01:14:59.488 --> 01:15:01.991
Mrs. Morgan, how does
it feel to finally know

01:15:02.025 --> 01:15:04.427
the truth about your
human trafficking husband?

01:15:05.428 --> 01:15:06.829
Let's get the lowdown.

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.098
Yeah.

01:15:09.132 --> 01:15:11.935
My husband's the best man I know

01:15:11.968 --> 01:15:15.439
and a better person
than you'll ever be.

01:15:15.472 --> 01:15:18.075
He stuck by us through
thick and thin.

01:15:18.108 --> 01:15:20.077
He's always been by our side.

01:15:21.345 --> 01:15:23.214
He may not be a saint,

01:15:23.247 --> 01:15:26.117
but he's a damn good
husband and father.

01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:28.286
And if you think you
can slither in here

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.422
and come between us,

01:15:30.455 --> 01:15:33.024
you've got another
fucking thing coming.

01:15:36.394 --> 01:15:37.529
Our family.

01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:41.467
And you?

01:15:49.475 --> 01:15:51.345
We stick together.

01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:55.449
No matter what.

01:15:55.482 --> 01:15:57.284
This family.

01:15:57.317 --> 01:15:59.119
So many surprises.

01:16:00.621 --> 01:16:02.290
Wanna stick together?

01:16:02.323 --> 01:16:03.491
You can die together.

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:05.560
Look, this was just business.

01:16:05.593 --> 01:16:07.495
So you keep saying.

01:16:07.528 --> 01:16:09.964
But to me, to us,

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:11.232
it was personal.

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.267
Look at you.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.070
Up to your eyeballs in shit.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:18.340
And still you won't apologize.

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.476
I am sorry!

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.378
Don't get me wrong, John.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.280
Saying your sorry doesn't
change a fuckin' thing.

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:26.049
Then what do you want?

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.984
It's time. Do it.

01:16:58.050 --> 01:16:59.017
Hello, John.

01:17:01.553 --> 01:17:02.455
Conway?

01:17:02.488 --> 01:17:04.991
Surprised to see me?

01:17:05.024 --> 01:17:06.459
Ah.

01:17:06.492 --> 01:17:09.028
It's all falling into place now.

01:17:09.062 --> 01:17:11.497
Yeah, you're part of
this lot, aren't you?

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.301
Part of what?

01:17:14.335 --> 01:17:17.104
I was gonna ask you what
the fuck is going on?

01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:18.439
Who are you?

01:17:18.472 --> 01:17:20.107
You know this cunt?

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.542
Know what he's done?

01:17:21.575 --> 01:17:23.310
I know what he's done to me.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:25.179
He's mine.

01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:26.314
No.

01:17:26.348 --> 01:17:27.982
That isn't happenin'.

01:17:29.184 --> 01:17:31.353
Seems you got a lot
of enemies, John.

01:17:34.989 --> 01:17:36.624
Listen, sweetheart.

01:17:36.658 --> 01:17:39.028
Put the gun down.

01:17:39.061 --> 01:17:41.030
I've waited too long for this.

01:17:42.631 --> 01:17:44.266
You see this piece of shit?

01:17:46.268 --> 01:17:47.536
He killed my daddy.

01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:52.676
What's your story?

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:56.046
This man is gonna
rot in fucking hell

01:17:56.079 --> 01:17:57.347
when I'm done with him.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.484
You are both out of
your fucking minds.

01:18:01.986 --> 01:18:04.589
You know, that might
be the truest thing

01:18:04.622 --> 01:18:06.657
to ever come out of your mouth.

01:18:08.761 --> 01:18:11.396
All right,
you want truth, Frank?

01:18:11.429 --> 01:18:15.167
Truth is, you're
in fucking denial.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.502
I never killed your old man.

01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:17.536
Shut up.

01:18:17.569 --> 01:18:19.171
He killed himself!

01:18:19.204 --> 01:18:20.973
It's not my fault he's dead.

01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:23.041
Fucking shut up!

01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:25.110
He crashed that fucking car

01:18:25.144 --> 01:18:29.048
'cause he was out of his
fucking brains drunk.

01:18:29.082 --> 01:18:30.483
He's a statistic.

01:18:30.517 --> 01:18:32.185
I said shut up!

01:18:33.987 --> 01:18:37.157
You know, it's almost comical

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.294
the way you care
about your dead dad.

01:18:40.327 --> 01:18:43.431
Do you think he gave two
fucking shits about you?

01:18:43.464 --> 01:18:45.332
I'm fucking warning you.

01:18:45.366 --> 01:18:49.705
What kind of father
gets paralytic drunk

01:18:49.739 --> 01:18:52.974
and then puts his kid in
the front seat with him, eh?

01:18:53.008 --> 01:18:55.143
I'd never do that to my Katie.

01:18:55.177 --> 01:18:56.411
Never!

01:19:02.753 --> 01:19:06.322
Look, go on.
Do it.

01:19:06.355 --> 01:19:10.226
I'd rather you did it than
this soppy bitch here.

01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:11.394
No.

01:19:11.427 --> 01:19:12.763
He doesn't get to do it.

01:19:12.796 --> 01:19:13.765
I do.

01:19:16.533 --> 01:19:18.535
He dies, they all fucking die.

01:19:18.569 --> 01:19:19.603
No.

01:19:21.638 --> 01:19:23.273
I'm here for him.

01:19:23.307 --> 01:19:24.241
Not you.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.248
I'll do it.

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.318
I'll do it.

01:19:41.327 --> 01:19:43.262
Put the gun down

01:19:43.295 --> 01:19:46.365
and I'll make it really quick.
I promise.

01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:47.700
If you don't, well.

01:19:49.804 --> 01:19:51.839
- Not today.
- Okay.

01:19:55.075 --> 01:19:57.110
Ah!

01:19:58.178 --> 01:19:59.346
John, John!

01:20:07.221 --> 01:20:10.826
I hope you didn't fucking
plan on being that stupid.

01:20:38.823 --> 01:20:39.858
Do it.

01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:41.425
Shoot me.

01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:48.666
Why do I care?

01:20:51.403 --> 01:20:53.104
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

01:20:55.407 --> 01:20:56.876
Sorry about that.

01:20:56.909 --> 01:20:58.410
Then get it over with.

01:21:00.445 --> 01:21:03.382
You already killed
me once 10 years ago.

01:21:05.384 --> 01:21:07.186
Nothing can be worse than that.

01:21:07.219 --> 01:21:08.454
No?

01:21:08.487 --> 01:21:09.655
Well, I can try.

01:21:09.689 --> 01:21:12.592
I can really
fucking try, can't I?

01:21:15.362 --> 01:21:16.798
I promise you that.

01:21:20.768 --> 01:21:22.804
I'm gonna kill you, okay,

01:21:23.871 --> 01:21:25.841
but not the way you think.

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:02.313
We're family, right?

01:22:02.346 --> 01:22:04.682
Are we family?

01:22:04.715 --> 01:22:06.985
Yeah, we stick together.

01:22:07.019 --> 01:22:08.653
No matter what.

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:12.791
I love you two.

01:23:02.779 --> 01:23:05.381
She told you there'd
be more of us.
