01:02.521 --> 01:04.489
Aah! You son of a bitch!

01:04.491 --> 01:05.491
Uhh!

01:05.492 --> 01:06.993
Did he bite you? Yeah.

01:06.994 --> 01:08.159
All right, don't move.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.160
Dale schrader, you're under arrest

01:10.161 --> 01:11.729
For the murder of stacy ryan

01:11.730 --> 01:13.430
And the kidnapping of your daughter jenny.

01:13.431 --> 01:14.831
Listen, we got him.

01:14.832 --> 01:16.332
No, I'm afraid. Please let me see my mom.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.666
Where is she? No, your mom--

01:17.667 --> 01:19.499
Your mom, she's gonna
meet us at the hospital.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.967
And he cannot hurt you.
You're gonna be fine.

01:21.968 --> 01:23.101
Let me say good-bye to her.

01:23.102 --> 01:24.836
You lost that right the minute you took her.

01:24.837 --> 01:26.704
She's gonna be-- she's my daughter.

01:26.705 --> 01:27.739
Jenny.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.540
No, no, it's ok. It's ok.

01:29.541 --> 01:31.708
He can't hurt you.

01:31.709 --> 01:32.841
Jenny.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.741
I'm sorry.

01:34.742 --> 01:36.409
You gonna ride in with her?

01:36.410 --> 01:38.677
Ok. Yeah, I got it.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.914
Jenny, listen to me. I promise you

01:42.915 --> 01:45.083
He's gonna go away for a long time.

01:45.084 --> 01:47.251
It's gonna be all right.

01:47.252 --> 01:48.251
Ok.

01:48.252 --> 01:49.619
Jenny.

01:54.091 --> 01:56.592
Hey. Morgan's gonna wait for the ambulance.

01:56.593 --> 01:58.494
Bunting and I are taking him in.

01:58.495 --> 02:01.562
Yeah--no, the cabin's empty. He just left...

02:01.563 --> 02:03.063
Yeah, cancel the amber alert.

02:03.064 --> 02:05.498
Man, on radio: Roger that. Truck recovered?

02:05.499 --> 02:06.800
Negative on the truck.

02:06.801 --> 02:09.168
The girl's upset, but she seems ok.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.236
Agent morgan is gonna bring her in.

02:11.237 --> 02:12.570
He's gonna escort her in the ambulance.

02:12.571 --> 02:14.171
They should be leaving in a couple minutes.

02:14.172 --> 02:15.305
Yeah, we got her.

02:15.306 --> 02:18.008
You want to talk to your mom?

02:18.009 --> 02:20.010
Mom?

02:20.011 --> 02:21.544
No, I'm ok.

02:21.545 --> 02:24.346
I promise.

02:29.752 --> 02:32.220
Killed a random woman and kidnapped his kid.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.988
Used the same truck.

02:33.989 --> 02:35.189
Not the brightest bulb.

02:35.190 --> 02:36.557
He's been locked up for 11 years.

02:36.558 --> 02:37.791
He's out of practice.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.392
Don't they say these guys
come out better criminals?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.426
Smart ones do.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.660
You saying I'm dumb?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.861
You're impatient, angry.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.930
You took your own kid just
to get back at your ex.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.864
You got it all figured out.

02:46.865 --> 02:49.033
Well, your ex-wife said-- she was a liar.

02:49.034 --> 02:50.433
And I should have killed her.

02:50.434 --> 02:53.870
Like you killed stacy ryan?

02:53.871 --> 02:56.204
Why did you do it?

02:56.205 --> 02:57.606
You wouldn't understand.

02:57.607 --> 02:59.107
Try me.

03:00.642 --> 03:02.509
Here's what I don't get about this guy.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.677
What's that?

03:03.678 --> 03:04.811
His whole life he's a thief,

03:04.812 --> 03:06.312
He comes out of prison a murderer.

03:06.313 --> 03:07.680
He killed an innocent woman.

03:07.681 --> 03:09.048
How do you know she's innocent?

03:09.049 --> 03:10.683
You stabbed her and threw
her out of a truck.

03:10.684 --> 03:12.050
What the hell did she ever do to you?

03:12.051 --> 03:13.685
You know, what I don't get

03:13.686 --> 03:16.287
Is why you couldn't just
appreciate the freedom.

03:16.288 --> 03:19.756
You could have holed up
in that cabin a long time,

03:19.757 --> 03:22.191
Enjoyed the quiet.

03:22.192 --> 03:24.693
But some people just need the distractions.

03:24.694 --> 03:28.096
You probably got used to all that
madness when you were locked up.

03:28.097 --> 03:31.365
It's madness for the sheep
to talk peace with a wolf.

03:31.366 --> 03:33.801
That sounds like something
my daddy would say.

03:33.802 --> 03:35.902
Thomas fuller.

03:35.903 --> 03:37.037
You impressed?

03:37.038 --> 03:39.372
I'm surprised.

03:39.373 --> 03:40.873
So you're the wolf.

03:40.874 --> 03:42.708
You have no idea.

03:42.709 --> 03:43.942
There it is.

03:43.943 --> 03:45.744
That ego.

03:45.745 --> 03:47.211
You know, for one second,

03:47.212 --> 03:48.713
You were unpredictable.

03:48.714 --> 03:51.848
But you can't help yourself.
You gotta talk a big talk.

03:51.849 --> 03:54.450
But just so you know, that's boring.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.886
Hey, what was that?

03:57.887 --> 03:58.921
Sit up.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.288
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

04:00.289 --> 04:01.823
What's going on? I don't know.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.392
I'm gonna pull over.

04:05.493 --> 04:06.660
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

04:06.661 --> 04:08.161
Can you turn the light on?

04:08.162 --> 04:09.462
I'm gonna be sick.

04:09.463 --> 04:10.563
Oh, what the hell?

04:10.564 --> 04:11.964
Ohh! Am I still boring?

04:11.965 --> 04:13.266
What?

04:13.267 --> 04:16.000
Am I boring?!

04:51.331 --> 04:59.533

05:20.106 --> 05:21.106
Ahh...

05:22.075 --> 05:24.676
Where are the keys? Uhh!

05:39.289 --> 05:42.323
Oh, wait! I'm a federal agent!

05:42.324 --> 05:45.625
I have a prisoner in here who's
just killed this officer!

05:45.626 --> 05:48.694
I knew it. You are one
committed son of a bitch.

05:48.695 --> 05:50.130
Ohh! Oh, my arm!

05:50.131 --> 05:52.700
No, no, that's the prisoner!

05:52.701 --> 05:54.034
What are you doing?

05:54.035 --> 05:56.202
Uhh! Give me the gun.

05:56.203 --> 05:57.603
What? What's wrong with you?

05:57.604 --> 05:59.005
You killed a cop?

05:59.006 --> 06:00.806
Give me the gun. She's a fed.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.008
Look, she knows there's two of us now.

06:03.009 --> 06:04.811
You're gonna need stitches.

06:04.812 --> 06:06.413
I'm not going to the hospital.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.849
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.

06:08.850 --> 06:09.916
You're gonna be all right. Give me the gun.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.818
Come on, give me the damn gun!

06:11.819 --> 06:13.286
Get in the truck! Come on!

06:14.922 --> 06:16.522
Come on!

06:23.796 --> 06:25.563
Uhh!

06:49.882 --> 06:53.117
"men are more ready to repay
an injury than a benefit,

06:53.118 --> 06:57.187
Because gratitude is a burden
and revenge a pleasure."

06:57.188 --> 06:58.755
Tacitus.

07:04.993 --> 07:06.493
Pull over. That's one of us. Pull over.

07:09.397 --> 07:10.964
Prentiss!

07:10.965 --> 07:13.266
Ohh. What the hell happened?
Are you all right?

07:13.267 --> 07:15.868
Bunting's down there. He's dead.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.902
Where's schrader?

07:16.903 --> 07:18.570
He's gone.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.238
It was a--a big...

07:21.239 --> 07:23.240
Truck, new york tags,

07:23.241 --> 07:26.308
Uh, victor alpha 737.

07:26.309 --> 07:29.711
They went northbound about 10 minutes ago.

07:29.712 --> 07:32.079
Son of a bitch got away.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.081
He's got a partner.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.550
First case back, we won,

07:37.551 --> 07:40.052
And you'll be home for breakfast.

07:40.053 --> 07:42.220
We never figured out why
schrader killed stacy ryan.

07:42.221 --> 07:44.022
She had no connection to his
daughter or his ex-wife.

07:44.023 --> 07:46.924
There's been an accident.
Emily's in the hospital, bunting's dead.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.125
Is she all right?

07:48.126 --> 07:49.226
She has a concussion.

07:49.227 --> 07:50.427
Is morgan with her? Yeah.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.428
Where's schrader?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.428
Northbound in a truck.

07:52.429 --> 07:53.395
A truck?

07:53.396 --> 07:54.596
He has a partner. What?

07:54.597 --> 07:55.696
We need roadblocks--now.

07:55.697 --> 07:56.863
Do we have a tag?

07:56.864 --> 07:58.197
Uh, emily murmured a partial.

07:58.198 --> 07:59.231
Better than nothing.

07:59.232 --> 08:00.566
He could be headed to canada.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.833
We need somebody who knows the area.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.034
I'll get an officer. And jj--

08:03.035 --> 08:06.271
Yeah, you want schrader's face everywhere.

08:06.272 --> 08:08.440
Schrader was a bank robber.

08:08.441 --> 08:09.741
Now he's murdered a woman,

08:09.742 --> 08:11.342
Kidnapped his daughter, and killed a cop.

08:11.343 --> 08:12.777
He's obviously more sophisticated

08:12.778 --> 08:14.011
Than we originally thought.

08:14.012 --> 08:15.179
He's got a bigger plan. It's not just about

08:15.180 --> 08:16.513
Getting his daughter and
fleeing the country.

08:16.514 --> 08:18.349
We never profiled that he'd have a partner.

08:18.350 --> 08:20.051
We don't know this guy at all.

08:25.891 --> 08:29.093
Got to admit you're better than I thought.

08:29.094 --> 08:31.728
Those idiots don't know what hit them.

08:31.729 --> 08:33.096
Sit still.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.063
At least give me some aspirin.

08:35.065 --> 08:37.667
Oh! Come on. Really?

08:37.668 --> 08:40.936
Oh, man. Are you done yet?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.571
We gotta go.

08:42.572 --> 08:43.938
I don't have the key.

08:43.938 --> 08:45.506
What?

08:45.507 --> 08:46.607
My contact wasn't there.

08:46.608 --> 08:48.042
Her shift starts at 8:00.

08:48.043 --> 08:50.777
Tomorrow? So we're just gonna wait?

08:50.778 --> 08:52.279
You know, this wouldn't be such a big deal

08:52.280 --> 08:53.447
If you hadn't killed a cop.

08:53.448 --> 08:56.451
Oh, he didn't know when to shut up.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.686
You know what's gonna happen now?

08:58.687 --> 09:00.387
They're gonna put your picture everywhere.

09:00.388 --> 09:01.955
They're gonna triple patrol.

09:01.956 --> 09:04.824
You just screwed your chances
of ever getting out of here.

09:04.825 --> 09:08.193
Well, see, that's where you come in.

09:08.194 --> 09:11.295
I got faith in you.

09:12.697 --> 09:15.765
Is this gonna leave a scar?

09:16.701 --> 09:18.602
No, we gotta find schrader.

09:18.603 --> 09:19.703
The team's got it covered.

09:19.704 --> 09:21.038
Don't make me stay here.

09:21.039 --> 09:22.973
I'm fine, honestly. Pull this thing over.

09:22.974 --> 09:25.041
Prentiss, you can't even focus.
You have a concussion.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.276
I saw the guy.

09:26.277 --> 09:27.343
White, 40s, I know.

09:27.344 --> 09:28.878
Ok, so give me a cognitive interview.

09:28.879 --> 09:30.012
Your adrenaline's pumping.

09:30.013 --> 09:31.013
Exactly.

09:31.014 --> 09:32.081
Emily, you're in shock.

09:32.082 --> 09:34.082
It just happened. It'll never be clearer.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.850
How many shots did you fire? 3.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.185
You emptied your clip.

09:37.186 --> 09:38.386
No...

09:38.387 --> 09:40.388
I did?

09:42.191 --> 09:44.959
All right, so schrader pulled
a series of bank heists

09:44.960 --> 09:46.193
In the 1990s.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.329
He was the only one to ever
go away for the crimes.

09:48.330 --> 09:51.098
He was a model prisoner,
only served 11 of his 15 years,

09:51.099 --> 09:53.166
Was released early on good behavior,

09:53.167 --> 09:56.102
And any friends he had are
either dead or still in prison.

09:56.103 --> 09:58.237
A 3-ton truck was found
north of the accident,

09:58.238 --> 09:59.805
Not too far from canada.

09:59.806 --> 10:01.573
We have the heaviest
presence at border crossings.

10:01.574 --> 10:02.808
He probably knows that.

10:02.809 --> 10:04.342
I don't think he's gonna sit still for long.

10:04.343 --> 10:06.543
He might have to depending
on how injured he is.

10:06.544 --> 10:07.711
What do we know?

10:07.712 --> 10:09.012
Dale schrader went to prison for robbery.

10:09.013 --> 10:10.847
He was hands off.
All of his crimes were impersonal.

10:10.848 --> 10:12.848
2 days after he's released,
he kills stacy ryan

10:12.849 --> 10:14.282
And he kidnaps his daughter.

10:14.283 --> 10:16.484
It's both personal and emotional.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.019
When he's not attached to the crime,
he pulls it off,

10:18.020 --> 10:19.854
But the minute he's invested,
like with his daughter,

10:19.855 --> 10:22.056
He lets his guard down and
gets caught. It makes sense.

10:22.057 --> 10:23.624
So he's not the hard-ass we thought he was.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.192
But if jenny were what he wanted,

10:25.193 --> 10:26.927
He had her. He could have left.

10:26.928 --> 10:28.729
Yeah, we thought he took her
and ran to canada, right?

10:28.730 --> 10:30.097
That theory made sense. Why didn't he?

10:30.098 --> 10:31.198
Pictures from the accident.

10:31.199 --> 10:32.299
Any word on emily?

10:32.300 --> 10:34.268
Apparently she's arguing with the doctors.

10:34.269 --> 10:35.235
That's good.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.503
This took a lot to pull off.

10:36.504 --> 10:39.239
What if he's got a group of guys to call on?

10:39.240 --> 10:41.508
I agree. All those bank jobs were a solo,

10:41.509 --> 10:44.410
But this is a lot for
one man to orchestrate.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.079
Figured out why he killed stacy ryan?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.914
We haven't found any connection to schrader,

10:47.915 --> 10:49.917
But he may be connected to the partner.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.885
How? Killing her might
have been advance payment

10:51.886 --> 10:53.587
For breaking him out of custody.

10:53.588 --> 10:55.255
Garcia, I need everything
you've got on stacy ryan.

10:55.256 --> 10:56.356
What do you mean he got away?

10:56.357 --> 10:58.225
Somebody broke him out of custody.

10:58.226 --> 10:59.426
Oh, god.

10:59.427 --> 11:00.861
We're gonna keep the two of you here.

11:00.862 --> 11:02.698
There's gonna be an officer
standing watch the entire time.

11:02.699 --> 11:04.500
If you can't find him,
how long will you keep us safe?

11:04.501 --> 11:05.835
Ma'am, we will find him.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.971
You don't know dale.
When he wants something, he gets it.

11:07.972 --> 11:10.241
Can you think of anyone at all
who might want to help him?

11:10.242 --> 11:11.709
He doesn't trust anybody.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.910
It's not necessarily about trust.

11:12.911 --> 11:14.379
Maybe somebody who's indebted to him

11:14.380 --> 11:15.914
And he was trying to collect on it?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.281
I don't know.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.283
Jenny...

11:21.886 --> 11:24.253
You and your dad were alone the entire time?

11:24.254 --> 11:27.086
Nobody was in the truck or the cabin?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.053
Nobody.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.721
Who would do this for dale?

11:29.722 --> 11:32.556
Who would risk everything to help him?

11:32.557 --> 11:35.456
That's what we need to find out.

11:35.457 --> 11:37.323
Stacy ryan had two times in her life--

11:37.324 --> 11:39.893
When she was high and when
she was waiting to get high.

11:39.894 --> 11:41.494
The only thread I have between them

11:41.495 --> 11:44.295
Is that her brother spent time
with schrader upstate like...

11:44.296 --> 11:45.396
5 years ago.

11:45.397 --> 11:47.098
Why would schrader kill a junkie?

11:47.099 --> 11:48.899
It doesn't make sense.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.700
Where's the brother now? Dead.

11:50.701 --> 11:53.098
It doesn't feel like schrader
does anything randomly.

11:53.099 --> 11:55.266
Stacy must have meant something to him.

11:55.267 --> 11:58.102
Yeah, but...What?

12:00.605 --> 12:03.106
Never mind, I see her.

12:05.643 --> 12:07.677
I can take her from here. Thanks.

12:07.678 --> 12:08.745
Thk you.

12:08.746 --> 12:10.479
I can walk. Sit.

12:11.381 --> 12:12.881
I like pushing you around.

12:15.384 --> 12:16.618
Does it hurt?

12:16.619 --> 12:18.876
If by "it" you mean my
entire body, then yes.

12:28.877 --> 12:30.992
Ok, so the partner saw
everything in the woods,

12:30.993 --> 12:32.666
He ran away and stole a truck?

12:32.667 --> 12:33.912
Who is this guy?

12:33.913 --> 12:35.553
He knew you were taking that
road back to the station.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.099
He waited for you and he crashed into you.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.372
This whole thing feels meticulous.

12:38.373 --> 12:40.792
Ok, so he needs the partner
for something else.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.165
For what, though?

12:42.166 --> 12:44.245
Well, I don't know. I mean,
he was locked up all this time.

12:44.246 --> 12:45.552
He planned the whole day.

12:45.553 --> 12:47.538
He should have had backup
plans for his backup plans.

12:47.539 --> 12:49.212
His ex shouldn't have
been home for a few hours,

12:49.213 --> 12:50.625
So he clearly had enough time

12:50.626 --> 12:52.738
To get across the border with
jenny until we showed up.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.278
But he stayed local, holed up in that cabin.

12:54.279 --> 12:56.264
He had what he wanted.
He could have just run.

12:56.265 --> 12:58.678
There's gotta be something
else keeping him in lockport.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.558
I couldn't stop him from choking bunting.

13:01.559 --> 13:02.798
Emily, don't do that.

13:02.799 --> 13:04.844
He was right there.

13:10.579 --> 13:11.930
Schrader's face is all over the news.

13:11.931 --> 13:13.437
He's been on the run for almost 2 hours

13:13.438 --> 13:14.782
And we're no closer to catching him.

13:14.783 --> 13:16.089
We need to find the partner.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.029
Hey.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.436
Hey. How are you?

13:18.437 --> 13:20.622
I feel like I got hit by a truck.

13:20.623 --> 13:22.330
Here, sit. Thanks.

13:22.331 --> 13:24.615
Uh, garcia, tell everyone
what you just told me.

13:24.616 --> 13:26.629
I have unearthed more of schrader's past.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.315
Now, what we do know is
that he robbed 15 banks

13:29.316 --> 13:30.955
In the state of new york in the nineties.

13:30.956 --> 13:33.908
However, what your resident glamou
r-puss smarty-pants just found out

13:33.909 --> 13:35.688
Was that most of that
money was never recovered.

13:36.539 --> 13:37.678
Where is it?

13:37.679 --> 13:39.624
My best guess-- only he knows.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.070
Good reason to stick around lockport.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.217
The last robbery, the one that put him away,

13:43.218 --> 13:44.964
Should have been routine,
right? So what happened?

13:44.965 --> 13:46.571
Maybe someone turned him in.

13:46.572 --> 13:48.284
He kept to himself, always worked alone.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.257
Who'd turn him in?

13:49.258 --> 13:50.264
We're missing somebody.

13:50.265 --> 13:51.977
Garcia.

13:51.978 --> 13:53.723
Yes, checking, sir.

13:53.724 --> 13:55.330
What's this all about?

13:55.331 --> 13:57.650
Nothing to do till morning.

14:02.477 --> 14:04.016
What's your problem?

14:05.964 --> 14:08.815
Hesitation puts obstacles in the path.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.395
Boldness eliminates them.

14:10.396 --> 14:12.542
Boldness strikes fear.

14:12.543 --> 14:15.428
Fear creates authority.

14:15.429 --> 14:18.714
"the 48 laws of power." you know it?

14:20.801 --> 14:23.013
You want to shoot me?

14:26.567 --> 14:28.819
Have I said thanks yet?

14:29.620 --> 14:32.872
Ok. Records leading up to schrader's arrest

14:32.873 --> 14:35.491
Show this other bank robber

14:35.492 --> 14:37.238
Named dan otey.

14:37.239 --> 14:38.945
And he was looking at
copious amounts of time,

14:38.946 --> 14:41.464
Then he strikes a deal and all
of a sudden schrader is arrested.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.043
It can't be a coincidence.

14:43.044 --> 14:44.650
You know, it's not uncommon
for criminals to buy jobs

14:44.651 --> 14:46.397
Off one another.
Maybe that's what schrader did,

14:46.398 --> 14:48.543
But dan otey sold him out
for a lesser sentence.

14:48.544 --> 14:49.683
It doesn't make sense.

14:49.684 --> 14:51.463
Otey was a rat and now he's the partner?

14:51.464 --> 14:52.676
Yeah, you're right.

14:52.677 --> 14:53.682
Schrader wouldn't trust him.

14:53.683 --> 14:55.089
If anything, he'd want him dead.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.396
Probably, but he'd use him first.

14:56.397 --> 14:57.809
He'd tell otey that he owes him one

14:57.810 --> 15:00.155
And that he might save his life if
he helps him get out of this jam.

15:00.156 --> 15:01.501
Where's he now, garcia?

15:01.502 --> 15:03.041
Uh, dan otey is a local.

15:03.042 --> 15:05.088
He lives off of route 7.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.459
Nobody's here. Let's go.

15:21.393 --> 15:22.466
Is your daddy home?

15:22.467 --> 15:23.947
Who are you?

15:23.948 --> 15:25.722
Close the door!

15:25.723 --> 15:27.169
Don't do this.

15:27.170 --> 15:30.997
Calm down. I'm just gonna
scare him a little bit.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.787
Hey, dan!

15:39.054 --> 15:41.974
You sent your son to the door?

15:42.749 --> 15:44.995
coward?

15:49.893 --> 15:51.861
His wife and son were home.

15:51.862 --> 15:53.496
Are they ok?

15:53.497 --> 15:54.831
The partner took them upstairs

15:54.832 --> 15:56.132
While schrader destroyed the place.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.568
Emily is with the wife right now.

16:00.138 --> 16:03.307
Dan had turned everything around.

16:03.308 --> 16:06.709
He was clean, life was finally good.

16:08.979 --> 16:13.216
But I was always afraid
to believe it, you know?

16:13.217 --> 16:15.885
Because then he could be taken away.

16:17.788 --> 16:20.089
I'm so sorry.

16:21.992 --> 16:25.928
The other man-- what did he look like?

16:28.265 --> 16:29.766
Uh, white...

16:29.767 --> 16:32.202
Mid-40s...

16:32.203 --> 16:34.104
Short hair...

16:34.105 --> 16:35.505
I don't know.

16:35.506 --> 16:37.741
Had you ever seen him before?

16:37.742 --> 16:40.043
Dale, yeah. The other guy, no.

16:40.044 --> 16:44.114
We're trying to figure out how
schrader knows his partner.

16:44.115 --> 16:46.248
I have no idea.

16:46.249 --> 16:49.016
How did they talk to each other?

16:49.017 --> 16:50.384
They didn't.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.785
Dale trashed the place,

16:51.786 --> 16:53.618
And the other guy took us upstairs.

16:53.619 --> 16:56.218
He kept pushing me and...Jason.

16:56.219 --> 16:58.251
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

16:58.252 --> 17:00.453
Did he hurt you?

17:00.454 --> 17:03.054
He just scared us.
He locked us in the back room.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.255
He locked you in the room and that's it?

17:05.256 --> 17:06.789
Yeah.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.657
He told us to shut up and keep it locked.

17:09.659 --> 17:13.260
But jason wouldn't stop crying.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.497
This wasn't the deal.

17:16.498 --> 17:17.798
Really?

17:17.799 --> 17:19.965
I didn't sign up to kill anybody.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.599
You saved my ass.

17:21.601 --> 17:23.167
You pulled me out of that car, remember?

17:23.169 --> 17:24.736
Then people died.

17:24.737 --> 17:26.003
I can't do it. I won't.

17:26.005 --> 17:27.438
Yes, you will.

17:27.439 --> 17:30.307
You terrorized that family.
You killed their father.

17:30.308 --> 17:32.576
Don't worry. The kid is young.

17:32.577 --> 17:34.244
He won't remember him.

17:34.245 --> 17:37.080
I also killed that cop.
Don't forget about him.

17:37.081 --> 17:38.248
You enjoyed it.

17:38.249 --> 17:41.618
Yes, I did. And you didn't stop me.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.520
Uhh!

17:44.521 --> 17:47.323
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

17:49.926 --> 17:52.962
Ha ha ha ha ha!

17:54.631 --> 17:56.432
Ooh...I get it.

17:56.433 --> 17:59.435
Ohh...You gotta do what you gotta do.

17:59.436 --> 18:01.003
And I want what I want.

18:01.004 --> 18:02.971
Come on, bro.

18:02.972 --> 18:04.973
Almost done.

18:12.982 --> 18:14.616
Schrader gets off on power.

18:14.617 --> 18:16.685
That and money are what motivate him.

18:16.686 --> 18:17.820
And revenge.

18:17.821 --> 18:19.955
11 years away, he comes out a murderer.

18:19.956 --> 18:22.058
Who needs a partner,
somebody as bold as him.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.458
And where'd they meet?

18:23.459 --> 18:25.893
Schrader was away and patient.

18:25.894 --> 18:28.128
The minute he got out,
he hooked up with his partner first,

18:28.129 --> 18:29.462
And then he killed stacy ryan

18:29.463 --> 18:30.763
On his way to kidnap his daughter.

18:30.764 --> 18:33.798
What's missing from his day?

18:33.799 --> 18:34.798
The money.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.230
He took his daughter but left the money.

18:36.231 --> 18:37.598
That doesn't make any sense.

18:37.599 --> 18:40.167
Did he have another plan on how
to support himself in canada?

18:40.168 --> 18:41.600
He's only known a life of crime.

18:41.601 --> 18:44.769
He's incapable of change.
Time away proved that.

18:44.770 --> 18:48.104
Well, otey's wife said that
the partner locked them away,

18:48.105 --> 18:49.805
Like he didn't want them to get hurt.

18:49.806 --> 18:51.973
He was protective. That's weird, right?

18:51.974 --> 18:54.175
They're both dominant personalities,

18:54.176 --> 18:56.877
But they sound like they
played good cop/bad cop.

18:56.878 --> 18:59.312
Well, it's been 4 hours since the accident.

18:59.313 --> 19:01.414
You still think I'm in shock?

19:01.415 --> 19:03.716
There's one way to find out.

19:05.718 --> 19:08.586
Ok. First thing,

19:08.587 --> 19:11.055
We go to the station, gonna get the key.

19:11.056 --> 19:14.190
Then we go to the bank, which opens at 9:00.

19:14.191 --> 19:15.158
Then we're done.

19:15.159 --> 19:16.794
It's not that easy. I told you.

19:16.795 --> 19:18.095
Not for me.

19:18.096 --> 19:20.331
But you-- everybody loves you.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.601
Ok, I do this. Then what?

19:22.602 --> 19:23.803
Then it's over.

19:23.804 --> 19:24.970
No.

19:24.971 --> 19:26.105
No?

19:26.106 --> 19:27.840
No. There's no version of me surviving this.

19:27.841 --> 19:30.109
You get what you want, I'm dead.

19:30.110 --> 19:33.746
Well, if you believe that, do it.

19:34.881 --> 19:38.217
Go ahead. You can stop this right now.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.419
You want me dead. How bad?

19:41.420 --> 19:44.054
Come on. Kill me.

19:44.055 --> 19:45.788
What?

19:45.789 --> 19:48.055
You need my help? Is that what you need?

19:49.123 --> 19:51.290
You know I'm not gonna stop this

19:51.291 --> 19:52.391
Until I get what I want.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.826
I'm not gonna stop it, but you can.

19:54.827 --> 19:58.262
You want to end it? Then do it. End it.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.696
Come on. Do it.

19:59.697 --> 20:02.331
Take a chance that this all
works out for you. Come on!

20:02.332 --> 20:03.732
Come on! Do it!

20:03.733 --> 20:04.967
Come on! Come on!

20:04.968 --> 20:07.969
End it! Do it! Come on! Do it!

20:13.540 --> 20:15.141
That's what I thought.

20:15.142 --> 20:18.644
It's not in you, joey. Never was.

20:23.382 --> 20:25.015
All right, take a deep breath, prentiss.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.348
Let's just do this.

20:26.349 --> 20:27.648
All right.

20:27.649 --> 20:29.381
Tell me what you saw. Was it dark?

20:29.382 --> 20:31.783
Yeah. You were there. You know it was.

20:31.784 --> 20:32.784
Come on, now.

20:32.785 --> 20:34.518
Ok.

20:34.519 --> 20:37.487
What did it smell like inside the car?

20:37.488 --> 20:38.520
Sweat.

20:38.521 --> 20:40.522
So you were hot?

20:40.523 --> 20:43.557
Yeah. I--I opened the window a little bit.

20:43.558 --> 20:44.992
It's really quiet.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.727
Are there any other cars on the road?

20:46.728 --> 20:48.229
There's one coming.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.265
What color is it?

20:50.266 --> 20:52.402
I...It's too bright.

20:52.403 --> 20:53.971
Ok, but you looked at it. You saw it.

20:53.972 --> 20:56.174
It's a 4-door hybrid, black.

20:56.175 --> 20:57.310
Where was schrader?

20:57.311 --> 20:59.279
He's looking out the window.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.282
Was he waiting for something?

21:01.283 --> 21:03.586
Here comes another car.

21:03.587 --> 21:06.155
A car or the truck? It's the truck.

21:06.156 --> 21:07.990
Schrader sees it.

21:07.991 --> 21:11.126
That's when it happens.
He's...Out of his seatbelt.

21:11.127 --> 21:12.994
He's hunched over.

21:12.995 --> 21:15.729
And he gets his cuffs out in front of him.

21:15.730 --> 21:17.064
Ok, then what?

21:17.065 --> 21:18.632
Uh, bunting pulled over,

21:18.633 --> 21:21.568
And--and schrader put his seatbelt back on.

21:21.569 --> 21:22.969
He knew it was coming.

21:22.970 --> 21:24.403
Where did the truck come from?

21:24.404 --> 21:26.739
Uh, behind us. Uh, no--

21:26.740 --> 21:29.674
Uh...It was in front of us.

21:29.675 --> 21:31.643
Who was driving, prentiss?

21:31.644 --> 21:33.277
I don't know. I can't see.

21:33.278 --> 21:34.846
Ok. It's all right, it's all right.

21:34.847 --> 21:36.780
You're sure it was the truck?

21:36.781 --> 21:38.115
Yeah. It's a big truck.

21:38.116 --> 21:41.117
Think. Who was driving?

21:41.118 --> 21:42.518
Who was driving?

21:42.519 --> 21:44.954
A white male, 40s.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.855
All right, now your car stops rolling.

21:46.856 --> 21:49.657
Yeah. Um...

21:49.658 --> 21:52.325
I'm pinned. My seatbelt is jammed.

21:52.326 --> 21:56.461
I can't breathe. I can't
see anything. I can hear--

21:56.462 --> 21:58.629
Oh, god, he's killing bunting.

21:58.630 --> 21:59.930
But the partner's not there yet?

21:59.931 --> 22:01.365
No. Where is he?

22:01.366 --> 22:02.933
He's running towards us.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.134
What's he wearing?

22:04.135 --> 22:05.968
Jeans. Boots.

22:05.969 --> 22:07.769
What's wrong with you? You killed a cop?

22:07.770 --> 22:09.070
He's freaked out that bunting's dead.

22:09.071 --> 22:10.404
Why would he care?

22:10.405 --> 22:12.505
I don't know. But he won't let him kill me.

22:12.506 --> 22:13.606
Give me the gun.

22:13.607 --> 22:14.573
She's a fed.

22:14.574 --> 22:16.041
She knows that there's two of us now.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.075
And he keeps telling him to...

22:18.076 --> 22:19.943
Put pressure on it. On the bleeding.

22:19.944 --> 22:21.811
Ok. It's gonna be ok.

22:21.812 --> 22:23.946
Wait. He was talking to me.

22:23.947 --> 22:26.649
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.884
You're gonna be all right. Understand?

22:28.885 --> 22:31.554
He knew we were on that road.

22:31.555 --> 22:32.956
He was upset that bunting was dead.

22:32.957 --> 22:34.459
He wouldn't let schrader kill me.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.427
He kept telling me to put pressure on it.

22:36.428 --> 22:39.764
And he was calm, like he's done this before.

22:39.765 --> 22:41.633
He was helping me.

22:41.634 --> 22:43.669
He took dan otey's family upstairs,

22:43.670 --> 22:44.670
Protected them from schrader.

22:44.671 --> 22:47.139
Do we really think a good guy hooked up

22:47.140 --> 22:49.674
With a criminal like dale schrader?

22:54.346 --> 22:56.714
You have one saved message.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.284
Joe, honey, it's me.

23:02.285 --> 23:04.619
He got us. All of us.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.321
I don't know where we are.

23:06.322 --> 23:08.322
God, I am so sorry.

23:08.323 --> 23:09.757
Help us, daddy!

23:09.758 --> 23:11.258
Just do what he says, ok?

23:11.259 --> 23:15.629
Please just do whatever he says.

23:17.785 --> 23:18.818
Joe, honey, it's me.

23:18.819 --> 23:20.553
He got us.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.089
You've almost got it.

23:24.090 --> 23:26.657
You're doing so good.

23:29.459 --> 23:31.393
I'm sorry. Please.

23:34.462 --> 23:36.296
Ohh!

23:36.297 --> 23:37.697
Oh, my god.

23:37.698 --> 23:40.733
My god, please stop!

23:40.734 --> 23:42.501
Don't you touch him!

23:42.502 --> 23:44.604
It's not his fault. I told him to do it.

23:44.605 --> 23:45.906
No, wait! What are you doing?

23:45.907 --> 23:46.907
Mom! Mommy!

23:46.908 --> 23:48.608
No! Don't take my kid!

23:48.609 --> 23:50.777
Mom! Mommy! Mom, help!

23:50.778 --> 23:52.812
Stop!

23:52.813 --> 23:53.813
Mom!

23:53.814 --> 23:55.314
No...

23:55.315 --> 23:57.617
mom!

24:01.867 --> 24:03.533
So how did schrader get this guy to sign on?

24:04.734 --> 24:06.401
Good people do bad things.

24:06.402 --> 24:08.369
I'm just saying, it happens.

24:08.370 --> 24:12.005
Right. But this partner wouldn't let me die.

24:12.006 --> 24:13.373
He protected otey's family.

24:13.374 --> 24:16.775
In the same day, he helped a
convicted felon escape custody.

24:16.776 --> 24:18.276
His loyalties are all over the place.

24:18.277 --> 24:20.044
The guy sounds desperate.

24:20.045 --> 24:22.747
Maybe he needs some money. I mean,
schrader's got a lot of it still out there.

24:22.748 --> 24:24.248
He could have promised him a cut.

24:24.249 --> 24:25.916
Ah, I don't know. He's an accomplice

24:25.917 --> 24:27.451
To 3 murders and a kidnapping.

24:27.452 --> 24:29.085
Is there enough money out there

24:29.086 --> 24:30.853
For you to sign on to something like that?

24:30.854 --> 24:33.254
So it's something bigger than the money.

24:33.255 --> 24:35.090
Um, maybe schrader's threatening him.

24:35.091 --> 24:36.292
Leverage?

24:36.293 --> 24:38.227
It would have to be big.

24:38.228 --> 24:41.063
We caught schrader because
he kidnapped his daughter.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.031
He was emotional and his guard was down.

24:43.032 --> 24:46.100
Clearly, family means more
to him than we thought.

24:46.101 --> 24:49.003
Schrader's ex-wife forced him
to give up custody of jenny.

24:49.004 --> 24:52.906
Maybe he wants this guy to know what
it feels like to lose his family, too.

24:52.907 --> 24:54.541
It sounds like revenge to me.

24:54.542 --> 24:55.742
Maybe it is.

24:57.211 --> 24:59.111
You know what I just don't get?

24:59.112 --> 25:01.946
Why people think you're a hero.

25:01.947 --> 25:03.381
I know something they don't.

25:03.382 --> 25:06.352
You want to be just like me.

25:06.353 --> 25:08.420
Honest men bore you.

25:08.421 --> 25:09.954
They're too predictable.

25:09.955 --> 25:12.322
And you'd rather die than be ordinary,

25:12.323 --> 25:15.526
So you take risks and you push the limits.

25:15.527 --> 25:17.693
But you were raised to be a good guy.

25:17.694 --> 25:20.495
It's in your blood. You can't help it.

25:20.496 --> 25:24.599
But that kills you a little bit.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.634
That's why you had to figure out a way

25:26.635 --> 25:27.902
For a good guy to be bad,

25:27.903 --> 25:29.437
And that's how you got into my world.

25:29.438 --> 25:30.437
Am I close?

25:30.438 --> 25:31.471
I want to talk to them.

25:31.472 --> 25:34.507
You got your message and that picture.

25:34.508 --> 25:37.376
How do I know you haven't
killed them already?

25:37.377 --> 25:38.744
You have to trust me.

25:40.847 --> 25:43.081
Whew.

25:43.082 --> 25:44.816
Well, I'm disappointed.

25:44.817 --> 25:47.718
But your wife and your kids
are gonna be devastated

25:47.719 --> 25:49.286
'cause they didn't have to die.

25:49.287 --> 25:51.721
Look, you're gonna kill me.
There's no point in hurting them.

25:51.722 --> 25:54.390
What kind of father are you?

25:54.391 --> 25:55.691
We've been over this.

25:55.692 --> 25:57.792
I'm the only one who knows where they are.

25:57.793 --> 26:01.695
As long as I'm alive, they're safe.

26:01.696 --> 26:05.899
If you stop helping me,
they're dead. How's that?

26:20.077 --> 26:21.944
Anything on schrader's case?

26:21.945 --> 26:24.547
The usual suspects-- judge, lawyers.

26:24.548 --> 26:26.181
They're all accounted for this morning.

26:26.182 --> 26:28.217
If it's revenge, then it's gotta
be someone who put him away.

26:28.218 --> 26:30.152
Well, it's not the officers who arrested him

26:30.153 --> 26:32.220
Or the judge who sentenced him.

26:32.221 --> 26:33.521
Then who is it?

26:33.522 --> 26:36.190
Garcia, I need the names of
every law enforcement agent

26:36.191 --> 26:37.624
Involved in the schrader case.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.192
You know everybody.

26:39.193 --> 26:42.094
Yeah, but I want every single employee
the year that he was arrested.

26:42.095 --> 26:43.329
Ok, give me a minute.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.397
A whole minute? Come on, baby girl, what,

26:45.398 --> 26:46.932
Are you losing your touch?

26:46.933 --> 26:48.600
Oh, watch your pretty mouth.

26:48.601 --> 26:51.136
Personnel records come at you now.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.239
Who's still active?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.206
Most.

26:56.207 --> 26:58.007
Would he risk using an active officer?

26:58.008 --> 27:00.075
Depends on how much he hates them.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.410
Has anyone retired?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.678
Yeah, two of them. Let's see-
-matt massey, jeff messick.

27:03.679 --> 27:05.213
Both married with kids, white, in their 50s.

27:05.214 --> 27:08.215
Wait, can I see those pictures?

27:08.216 --> 27:10.050
No.

27:10.051 --> 27:11.251
No.

27:11.252 --> 27:13.753
Ohh. Why wouldn't he go
after one of the officers

27:13.754 --> 27:15.021
Who arrested him?

27:15.022 --> 27:16.922
It makes the most sense for revenge.

27:16.923 --> 27:18.490
Hey, wait a minute, guys. Listen to this.

27:18.491 --> 27:21.092
There was a witness who never
testified on schrader's behalf.

27:21.093 --> 27:23.127
Schrader could see that as a betrayal.

27:23.128 --> 27:26.197
He gets out of prison and
uses him to get what he wants.

27:26.198 --> 27:29.665
Garcia, I want you to run a history
on a witness from the schrader case,

27:29.666 --> 27:30.732
Joey short.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.066
Joey short.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.367
Was born in '66 in nyc.

27:34.368 --> 27:36.635
Didn't hold a lot of jobs
except for construction.

27:36.636 --> 27:38.003
In and out of rehab.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.204
Where is he now?

27:39.205 --> 27:41.406
His last known address was 10 years ago.

27:41.407 --> 27:42.507
Did he do time?

27:42.508 --> 27:44.042
Mm-mmm. No.

27:44.043 --> 27:45.376
Come on, garcia.
People don't just disappear.

27:45.377 --> 27:48.012
This guy's got a history
with a lot of holes in it.

27:48.013 --> 27:49.146
He went to rehab.

27:49.147 --> 27:50.981
You know, maybe this guy
had to walk the walk.

27:50.982 --> 27:52.249
He was undercover.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.750
That makes sense.

27:53.751 --> 27:55.418
Those guys are up for anything,

27:55.419 --> 27:58.186
And they take big risks,
professionally and personally.

27:58.187 --> 28:00.622
It explains his behavior, too.
Good guy doing bad things.

28:00.623 --> 28:02.825
Garcia, can you get us
joey short's real name?

28:02.826 --> 28:04.060
It's not here.

28:04.061 --> 28:06.129
Well, if schrader can find it, so can we.

28:06.130 --> 28:07.631
The guy needed to be schrader's friend,

28:07.632 --> 28:09.099
So they're probably around the same age.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.434
Look for academy graduates
in the early nineties.

28:11.435 --> 28:12.502
Ok.

28:12.503 --> 28:14.537
Did any of them not go into police work?

28:14.538 --> 28:16.438
Baby, I don't follow you.

28:16.439 --> 28:18.773
If he went undercover,
then anything tied to the academy

28:18.774 --> 28:20.808
Would have to be severed.
I mean, the guy graduated,

28:20.809 --> 28:23.878
Be he had to immediately start
working his history as joey short.

28:23.879 --> 28:25.346
He went into construction,

28:25.347 --> 28:27.214
Made his contacts in the bank robbery world,

28:27.215 --> 28:28.448
And then he met schrader,

28:28.449 --> 28:29.516
Earned schrader's trust,

28:29.517 --> 28:32.652
And then turned him in
and got out of the game.

28:32.653 --> 28:34.553
Ok. Here's a couple of guys
look like they dropped out.

28:34.554 --> 28:35.788
You got any pictures?

28:35.789 --> 28:38.490
Sending them your way now.

28:39.692 --> 28:41.659
That is the guy.

28:41.660 --> 28:44.962
That picture is 10 years old,
but that's him.

28:44.963 --> 28:46.230
That is joe muller.

28:46.231 --> 28:47.931
He has a wife and 2 kids.

28:47.932 --> 28:50.633
That's definitely the guy. Where is he now?

28:52.503 --> 28:53.703
betts.

28:53.704 --> 28:55.003
Yes?

28:56.005 --> 28:57.906
Joe muller.

28:57.907 --> 28:59.741
Let me look at you.

28:59.742 --> 29:01.242
How's life?

29:01.243 --> 29:02.210
It's a ride.

29:02.211 --> 29:03.677
Molly, the kids? Good. They're good.

29:03.678 --> 29:04.978
What are you doing here?

29:04.979 --> 29:07.714
Just, uh, you know, working on an old case.

29:07.715 --> 29:09.182
Uh, they stopped paying you, didn't they?

29:09.183 --> 29:10.683
Yes, ma'am.

29:10.684 --> 29:12.384
Don't you ma'am me. What do you need?

29:12.385 --> 29:13.685
Just, uh, 5 minutes?

29:13.686 --> 29:14.753
You got it.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.387
You're the best.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.524
Ok, thanks.

29:20.525 --> 29:21.992
Muller's not at home. No one is.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.493
His wife didn't show up at work,

29:23.494 --> 29:25.361
The kids weren't at
school yesterday or today.

29:25.362 --> 29:26.729
Schrader probably has them hostage.

29:26.730 --> 29:27.796
Yeah, but where?

29:27.797 --> 29:30.165
What could joe muller do for him?

29:30.166 --> 29:32.133
The only thing that's left.
He can get him the money.

29:32.134 --> 29:33.501
Well, no one even knows where it is.

29:33.502 --> 29:34.468
Schrader knows.

29:34.469 --> 29:35.903
Where do these guys hide money?

29:35.904 --> 29:37.204
Someplace safe.

29:37.205 --> 29:40.306
Would he be bold enough to
hide it a safe deposit box?

29:40.307 --> 29:41.874
A thief using a bank? Yeah, maybe.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.642
Schrader can't walk into a bank.

29:43.643 --> 29:44.877
His face is everywhere.

29:44.878 --> 29:47.113
No one would think twice
if muller walked in.

29:47.114 --> 29:49.014
He'd have to have a key.

29:52.517 --> 29:55.486
Where's the physical evidence
from the schrader case?

29:55.487 --> 29:56.720
We don't have it.

29:56.721 --> 29:59.422
Well, if we can figure out
where schrader hid the money,

29:59.423 --> 30:01.157
We'll know where he's going.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.761
Hi.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.430
Thank you.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.198
We're with the fbi.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.934
We're working the dale schrader case.

30:12.935 --> 30:14.769
Is joe muller helping you?

30:14.770 --> 30:15.936
No.

30:15.937 --> 30:17.337
He was just here.

30:17.338 --> 30:18.338
When?

30:18.339 --> 30:19.439
2 minutes ago.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.740
Thank you.

30:26.112 --> 30:28.112
Where's my family?

30:28.113 --> 30:30.247
2839 hillcrest drive.

30:30.248 --> 30:32.916
Hillcrest? You got them downtown?

30:32.917 --> 30:35.285
No, that's where my money is.

30:36.587 --> 30:41.156
Then what? This is never gonna end, is it?

30:42.959 --> 30:44.259
Stop the car!

30:44.260 --> 30:45.560
Put your hands where I can see them!

30:45.561 --> 30:47.695
Don't shoot. Schrader, put it down!

30:47.696 --> 30:48.796
Put it down!

30:48.797 --> 30:51.097
You really gonna let me blow his brains out?

30:51.098 --> 30:52.732
Drop it or I'll shoot!

30:52.733 --> 30:55.368
What's wrong, agent? You still
upset that I killed your buddy?

30:55.369 --> 30:56.468
Did he have kids like this one?

30:56.469 --> 30:59.238
Huh? Look at her. She's pissed.

30:59.239 --> 31:00.172
Don't kill him.

31:00.173 --> 31:01.439
Look at that look in her eyes.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.440
She's gonna. She is gonna do it.

31:02.441 --> 31:03.741
Come on, what are you gonna do?!

31:03.742 --> 31:05.376
Don't shoot. Don't do it, schrader.

31:05.377 --> 31:06.944
How's your arm?

31:08.513 --> 31:09.980
Hey!

31:09.981 --> 31:11.948
No! No!

31:11.949 --> 31:13.416
Where are they? Where's my family?

31:13.417 --> 31:14.917
Tell me where they are! Back up! Get away!

31:14.918 --> 31:15.918
Help him!

31:15.919 --> 31:17.653
Get away from him! Back off!

31:17.654 --> 31:20.155
She just killed my family.

31:20.156 --> 31:21.722
You just killed my family!

31:21.723 --> 31:23.991
Calm down! You just killed my family!

31:23.992 --> 31:25.425
You killed my family! Calm down!

31:25.426 --> 31:26.760
Hey!

31:26.761 --> 31:28.661
Stop!

31:35.262 --> 31:36.929
The only person who knew where my family was

31:37.130 --> 31:38.196
And now he's dead.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.798
I had every chance to kill him.

31:39.799 --> 31:42.567
But I couldn't. Because he had my family.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.468
2 days. Somewhere.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.270
And this photograph is
the only proof of life?

31:47.271 --> 31:48.938
Where's my phone?

31:51.441 --> 31:53.408
Joe, honey, it's me.

31:53.409 --> 31:55.843
He got us. All of us.

31:55.844 --> 31:57.578
I don't know where we are.

31:57.579 --> 31:59.581
God, I am so sorry.

31:59.582 --> 32:01.049
Help us, daddy!

32:01.050 --> 32:02.483
Just do what he says, ok?

32:02.484 --> 32:03.751
Please just do whatever he says.

32:03.752 --> 32:05.386
I'm gonna get garcia to trace this.

32:05.387 --> 32:06.520
Unknown name, unknown number.

32:06.521 --> 32:07.888
She might be able to help.

32:07.889 --> 32:09.857
There was only one phone call?

32:09.858 --> 32:11.992
I tried to get him to let me talk
to them again, but he wouldn't.

32:11.993 --> 32:14.462
There must not be anyone
there watching them.

32:14.463 --> 32:17.899
So he hid a family where no
one hears them call for help.

32:17.900 --> 32:19.000
Someplace remote. That cabin?

32:19.001 --> 32:20.401
No. The locals tore it apart.

32:20.402 --> 32:21.502
There's no one there.

32:21.503 --> 32:23.237
Where are they?

32:23.238 --> 32:24.704
You saw schrader since he's had your family.

32:24.705 --> 32:26.773
You saw something or heard it.

32:26.774 --> 32:27.973
There's got to be some clue.

32:27.974 --> 32:30.274
When was the last time you saw your family?

32:30.275 --> 32:32.908
Hold on, joe, I've got to get my phone.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.877
Oh, uh, it's right here.

32:34.878 --> 32:35.877
Oh.

32:35.878 --> 32:36.911
Cold drains the battery.

32:36.912 --> 32:37.945
I know. Sorry.

32:37.946 --> 32:38.913
Ok.

32:38.914 --> 32:42.049
See you later, mrs. Muller.

32:42.050 --> 32:44.018
If you're lucky.

32:44.019 --> 32:46.554
You notice any cars on the street?

32:46.555 --> 32:48.556
Nothing.

32:48.557 --> 32:50.824
let me get your seatbelt in.

32:54.194 --> 32:55.628
Our routine's the same every day.

32:55.629 --> 32:58.663
The kids have to be at school by 8:15,
then molly heads to work.

32:58.664 --> 33:01.531
She didn't make it to either yesterday.
What was her route?

33:01.532 --> 33:03.699
Uh, north on route 7, east on 22.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.901
Is that route isolated
during the morning commute?

33:05.902 --> 33:07.569
No.

33:07.570 --> 33:10.338
If he was watching, there's a good
chance she never left the driveway.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.908
I drove out first.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.648
Drive.

33:21.649 --> 33:24.584
I just left them there.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.954
Where did he find you?

33:28.190 --> 33:30.791
At the hardware store.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.268
I know who you are.

33:43.137 --> 33:44.604
He told me how for 11 years

33:44.605 --> 33:46.972
He'd been trying to figure
out how he got locked up.

33:46.973 --> 33:49.340
He knew otey had ratted
him out for the robbery,

33:49.341 --> 33:51.244
But that wasn't enough to put him away.

33:51.245 --> 33:53.655
He said I was the piece that didn't fit.

33:53.656 --> 33:55.556
He figured out I was a cop.

33:55.557 --> 33:56.590
And he took your family.

33:56.591 --> 33:58.692
Did you ever see this woman?

33:58.693 --> 34:00.627
Yeah. I think she's some junkie.

34:00.628 --> 34:02.596
I saw her right after he told me...

34:02.597 --> 34:04.430
You help me, your family lives.

34:04.431 --> 34:07.867
You don't, they die.

34:07.868 --> 34:09.034
Pull over right up here.

34:09.034 --> 34:10.201
Right here.

34:12.971 --> 34:15.172
Stacy. I don't have time for this.

34:15.172 --> 34:18.741
I told you, there'll be more when it's over.

34:18.742 --> 34:20.708
I got some people helping
and they don't want to wait.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.442
That's not my problem.

34:29.782 --> 34:32.650
My brother said you were a son of a bitch.

34:32.652 --> 34:35.353
You know what he's doing?

34:35.353 --> 34:37.522
Huh? You know what's in here?

34:37.523 --> 34:39.056
Huh? Hold on!

34:47.835 --> 34:49.534
Open the door. Who is she?

34:52.371 --> 34:53.571
Go.

34:53.572 --> 34:55.505
Come on. Drive.

34:55.507 --> 34:57.241
Go!

34:59.577 --> 35:01.177
You didn't know what she was talking about?

35:01.178 --> 35:02.178
No.

35:02.179 --> 35:04.512
Pull over.

35:04.513 --> 35:07.182
What are you gonna do with her?

35:22.897 --> 35:25.031
He could have left the body in the alley.

35:25.032 --> 35:26.165
Why didn't he?

35:26.166 --> 35:29.201
He didn't want to draw
attention to that place.

35:29.202 --> 35:30.402
Where was it?

35:30.403 --> 35:31.770
Uh, south of van wyck.

35:31.771 --> 35:32.804
Bad area?

35:32.805 --> 35:33.905
Abandoned. Junkies took over.

35:33.906 --> 35:35.540
Perfect place to leave hostages.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.208
Can you take us back there?

35:37.209 --> 35:39.376
Wait. You think she knew about my family.

35:39.377 --> 35:41.011
Her murder was the only
thing that didn't fit,

35:41.012 --> 35:44.781
And now it makes sense.
Schrader killed her to shut her up.

35:49.719 --> 35:50.719
Rossi.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.721
Turn around. Turn around!

35:52.722 --> 35:54.322
Fbi. Where are they?

35:54.323 --> 35:55.890
Give me the stuff, I'll tell you.

35:55.891 --> 35:57.558
Where are the kids?

35:57.559 --> 35:58.826
What kids?

35:58.827 --> 36:01.228
Get him out of here.
He don't know nothin' else.

36:06.932 --> 36:10.067
We're going up. Come on, rossi.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.070
Clear!

36:16.739 --> 36:19.040
Clear. Clear.

36:34.729 --> 36:36.197
Molly?

36:36.198 --> 36:37.732
Hey.

36:37.733 --> 36:38.900
The kids.

36:38.901 --> 36:40.535
I'm so sorry.

36:40.536 --> 36:41.936
Where are they?

36:41.937 --> 36:42.903
I don't know.

36:42.904 --> 36:43.970
Where are the kids?

36:43.971 --> 36:45.338
I don't know. Find them.

36:45.339 --> 36:47.005
All right. You're gonna be ok.

36:47.006 --> 36:49.341
I got you.

36:49.342 --> 36:52.044
Ok.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.245
Ohh...

37:00.682 --> 37:01.948
Clear!

37:04.618 --> 37:06.986
Clear!

37:07.821 --> 37:08.821
Rossi.

37:08.822 --> 37:10.323
Hey.

37:10.324 --> 37:12.759
Hey, little man.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.161
Hey, it's ok.

37:15.162 --> 37:18.097
It's ok.

37:18.098 --> 37:21.100
Go get muller.

37:21.101 --> 37:23.736
Your dad's looking for you.

37:23.737 --> 37:25.304
We're gonna get you out of here.

37:25.305 --> 37:26.672
It's gonna be ok, all right?

37:26.673 --> 37:28.507
We're getting your dad right now.

37:31.978 --> 37:34.212
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:35.214 --> 37:37.882
Are you ok?

37:46.326 --> 37:48.494
Oh, hey.

37:48.495 --> 37:51.697
Hey. Ok.

37:54.034 --> 37:55.968
Ok.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.870
How you doing? Can I pick you up?

37:57.871 --> 38:00.773
Ok. Ok.

38:25.734 --> 38:28.036
Come here, sweetheart.

38:28.037 --> 38:30.739
Oh, I got you.

38:39.182 --> 38:41.450
Washington irving said,

38:41.451 --> 38:43.352
"there is a sacredness in tears.

38:43.353 --> 38:46.355
"they are not the mark of weakness,
but of power.

38:46.356 --> 38:49.157
"they are messengers of overwhelming grief

38:49.158 --> 38:51.959
And of unspeakable love."

39:07.878 --> 39:10.313
You got a sec?

39:10.314 --> 39:12.248
Come in.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.452
I just wanted to say

39:15.453 --> 39:18.856
That you exceeded all
expectations leading this team.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.757
Mine and everyone else's.

39:20.758 --> 39:21.992
So have you, hotch.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.661
You showed the skill and
confidence of a natural leader,

39:24.662 --> 39:26.929
And...I thank you for it.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.730
Of course.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.267
I get why you're back.

39:32.268 --> 39:33.635
Do you?

39:33.636 --> 39:35.870
You were never going to sit
behind a desk. You know why?

39:35.871 --> 39:38.806
Because your son knows
that you get the bad guys.

39:38.807 --> 39:41.542
And if you're not out there trying to catch them,
what's he going to think?

39:41.543 --> 39:44.712
Well, tonight he's gonna think
I wasn't there at bedtime.

39:46.215 --> 39:48.949
You're his hero, hotch.

39:50.218 --> 39:54.922
I, uh, figured I'd save you a couple hours.

39:56.357 --> 39:58.392
You don't have to do that anymore.

39:58.393 --> 40:00.027
I know I don't.

40:00.028 --> 40:04.065
But I also know what it's like
to be raised by a single parent.

40:04.066 --> 40:06.534
Every minute counts.

40:06.535 --> 40:08.870
So if you need me to make
that a regular thing,

40:08.871 --> 40:11.673
I'd be more than happy to.

40:11.674 --> 40:13.074
I appreciate that.

40:13.075 --> 40:14.609
I really do.

40:18.513 --> 40:19.914
Good night.

40:19.915 --> 40:21.682
Good night.
