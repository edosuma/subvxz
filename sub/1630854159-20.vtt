00:01.311 --> 00:02.381
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie"...</i>

00:02.519 --> 00:04.073
Isabel.
I've been trying to find you.

00:04.211 --> 00:05.074
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:05.212 --> 00:06.213
That was my wife.

00:06.351 --> 00:07.386
- You were a nurse?
- No, a cop.

00:07.524 --> 00:08.422
Narcotics.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.044
Hi, it's Skip Tracer Randy.

00:10.182 --> 00:11.666
I'm a bounty hunter now.

00:11.804 --> 00:14.428
Promise you'll call me
if you get into any trouble.

00:14.566 --> 00:15.429
Of course.

00:15.567 --> 00:16.775
- Weird guy.
- Mm-hmm.

00:23.885 --> 00:24.748
Bailey?

00:35.104 --> 00:37.071
Ooh.

00:37.209 --> 00:38.866
Are you okay?

00:39.004 --> 00:40.730
Why is alcohol?

00:40.868 --> 00:42.559
You and Libby really
tore it up, didn't you?

00:42.697 --> 00:43.940
I didn't even hear you
come in last night.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.769
I'm officially too old
to do shots.

00:45.907 --> 00:46.770
How many did you do?

00:46.908 --> 00:49.187
- Which bar?
- Yikes.

00:49.325 --> 00:50.912
Well, maybe
you should think about

00:51.051 --> 00:52.742
not trying to relive
your college days.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.882
It is all Libby wants to do.

00:55.020 --> 00:58.092
She says it makes the other
360 days of diaper changing

00:58.230 --> 00:59.093
more tolerable.

00:59.231 --> 01:00.543
Like tonight, she wants to go

01:00.681 --> 01:01.716
to some underground party

01:01.854 --> 01:03.925
where a van picks you up
on a street corner

01:04.064 --> 01:05.134
and blindfolds you.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.204
Yeah, that's not a party.

01:06.342 --> 01:07.584
That's a--that's a kidnapping.

01:07.722 --> 01:08.758
Just tell her
you don't want to go.

01:08.896 --> 01:10.449
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:10.587 --> 01:11.450
Dude.

01:11.588 --> 01:13.383
Last night was so much fun.

01:13.521 --> 01:15.523
Oh, thanks again
for letting me crash here.

01:15.661 --> 01:16.938
But don't tell Roger
if he calls.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.423
I'm using the hotel allowance

01:18.561 --> 01:20.528
to upgrade our festivities.

01:20.666 --> 01:21.633
Why are you down there?
- Oh.

01:21.771 --> 01:23.738
I'm, um--I'm just posing

01:23.876 --> 01:26.120
for this photography project
that I'm working on.

01:26.258 --> 01:27.570
It's like--it's like
the disconnect

01:27.708 --> 01:29.330
between beauty and, um...

01:29.468 --> 01:31.160
Aging.

01:31.298 --> 01:32.816
Not aging.

01:32.954 --> 01:33.817
Consumerism.

01:33.955 --> 01:35.302
Fun.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.855
Well, I'm gonna go for a run.
Do you wanna come?

01:36.993 --> 01:38.305
Yeah, of course.

01:38.443 --> 01:39.927
Just let me put my clothes on.
I'll be right there.

01:42.032 --> 01:43.758
You are in no shape
to go running.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.035
I can't let her beat me.

01:45.174 --> 01:47.210
That is a super mature attitude.

01:47.348 --> 01:48.660
Shut up and hold my hair.

01:48.798 --> 01:50.179
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

01:51.318 --> 01:52.974
Oh. You had the clams.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.392
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you like
I know you want me to do ♪</i>

01:59.533 --> 02:00.913
That looks good.

02:01.051 --> 02:02.018
Mm, thank you.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.053
Mm-hmm.

02:03.192 --> 02:04.193
Hey.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.165
There are other rooms
in the apartment for that.

02:11.303 --> 02:14.030
I thought
you were sleeping in today.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.790
No classes.
- I was,

02:15.928 --> 02:18.138
but then I was pulled
out of my slumber

02:18.276 --> 02:20.347
by the smell of pancakes.

02:20.485 --> 02:22.038
Yeah? You want some?

02:22.176 --> 02:24.178
One or two?
- Uh, three, please.

02:25.352 --> 02:26.974
Three.

02:27.112 --> 02:29.425
No, wait. Um, shoot.

02:29.563 --> 02:30.598
Totally forgot.

02:30.736 --> 02:32.324
Um...

02:32.462 --> 02:34.188
Isabel, uh, texted me.

02:34.326 --> 02:36.156
She's in town
and needed to talk,

02:36.294 --> 02:37.260
so I--I just told her
to come here.

02:37.398 --> 02:38.261
I hope that's okay.

02:38.399 --> 02:40.125
Oh, yeah, um...

02:40.263 --> 02:41.471
Of course.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

02:41.609 --> 02:43.197
I meant to tell you after
you got out of the shower,

02:43.335 --> 02:45.372
but you know,
I got in the shower, and--

02:45.510 --> 02:46.373
Stop.

02:46.511 --> 02:47.753
Oh, please, stop.

02:47.891 --> 02:49.065
I'll get it.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.722
Sorry.
- It's okay.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.173
Hi. You must be Isabel.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.864
I'm Tamara.
- Hey.

02:55.002 --> 02:56.348
Hey.

02:56.486 --> 02:57.660
Look at you. You look great.

02:57.798 --> 02:59.317
Oh, thanks.

02:59.455 --> 03:02.630
Amazing what a few years
of sobriety does for the skin.

03:02.768 --> 03:04.149
It's nice to see you again, Lucy.

03:04.287 --> 03:06.047
Thanks for letting me
crash your breakfast.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.394
No, no, not at all.

03:07.532 --> 03:09.050
Um, can I get you something?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.397
Wouldn't say no
to some coffee.

03:10.535 --> 03:11.398
Okay.

03:11.536 --> 03:12.502
Come over here.

03:14.332 --> 03:15.919
- When did you get in?
- A few hours ago.

03:16.057 --> 03:17.576
Is that <i>the</i> Isabel?

03:17.714 --> 03:18.750
The ex-wife, Isabel?

03:18.888 --> 03:20.200
Stop. You're so loud.

03:20.338 --> 03:22.063
Yes.

03:22.685 --> 03:23.789
Tim invited her here?

03:23.927 --> 03:24.963
That's weird, right?

03:25.101 --> 03:27.310
No.
I mean, it's totally fine.

03:27.448 --> 03:28.449
It's...

03:30.106 --> 03:31.521
It's a little weird.

03:31.659 --> 03:32.971
I'm going to do
a little digging.

03:33.109 --> 03:34.662
- No.
- Yes, I am.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.250
Tamara, seriously, don't.

03:38.494 --> 03:39.495
So is everything okay?

03:39.633 --> 03:41.013
Oh, yeah, I'm fine,

03:41.151 --> 03:43.223
but I need your help.

03:43.361 --> 03:45.777
I worked a UC assignment
eight years ago,

03:45.915 --> 03:47.330
before I fell from grace,

03:47.468 --> 03:48.918
infiltrating the Teska family.

03:49.056 --> 03:50.402
Oh, I know all about 'em.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.404
Yeah, they're big time
in Sylmar.

03:52.542 --> 03:53.957
Guns, drugs, prostitution.

03:54.095 --> 03:55.959
Yeah, back in the day,
they were up-and-comers,

03:56.097 --> 03:57.616
but they had big ambitions.

03:57.754 --> 03:58.790
The boss was Frank.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.378
He had a 10-year-old daughter, Dara.

04:00.516 --> 04:02.103
Great kid. Super bright.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.415
I'm sure you took her
under your wing.

04:03.553 --> 04:04.968
Yeah. I mean, someone had to.

04:05.106 --> 04:06.315
He was a single dad.

04:06.453 --> 04:07.971
Barely paid any attention
to her.

04:08.109 --> 04:09.179
I was part of the crew,

04:09.318 --> 04:10.629
so I was at the house
all the time,

04:10.767 --> 04:12.493
and we became close...

04:12.631 --> 04:14.150
in that weird way you do

04:14.288 --> 04:15.703
when you're pretending
to be someone else.

04:15.841 --> 04:17.533
But after we arrested her dad,

04:17.671 --> 04:19.397
I scattered, you know,

04:19.535 --> 04:22.469
left that identity behind,
and went on to the next case.

04:22.607 --> 04:24.333
I hadn't heard from her
in eight years.

04:24.471 --> 04:25.403
Until now.

04:25.541 --> 04:27.301
Yeah,
I had a answering service

04:27.439 --> 04:29.165
through the department
as a firewall

04:29.303 --> 04:30.891
between that life
and my real one.

04:31.029 --> 04:34.653
Last night, they forwarded me
a message from Dara.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.794
<i>Nikki, it's Dara.</i>

04:37.932 --> 04:39.209
<i>I know it's been forever.</i>

04:39.348 --> 04:40.418
<i>I don't even know
if you still check this,</i>

04:40.556 --> 04:41.936
<i>but I'm scared,</i>

04:42.074 --> 04:43.490
<i>and I didn't know who to call.</i>

04:43.628 --> 04:44.560
<i>Sorry. This was dumb.
I shouldn't have--</i>

04:45.664 --> 04:46.700
<i>I have to go.</i>

04:46.838 --> 04:48.184
I called her back
a few hours later.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.185
No answer.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.842
Ran a quick social media check.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.015
Reached out to her friends.

04:52.153 --> 04:53.154
No one's seen her.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.535
And you can't go
knocking on doors

04:54.673 --> 04:56.192
in the old neighborhood
'cause you're out of cover.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.504
Exactly.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.815
No, why don't you
come down to the station?

04:58.953 --> 05:00.783
I'll get a warrant
for her phone.

05:00.921 --> 05:01.887
We'll find her.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.372
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.041
Well, that's where
that lives now.

05:18.179 --> 05:19.008
I got it.

05:21.148 --> 05:22.183
Show-off.

05:24.013 --> 05:26.256
You can start maternity leave
at any time.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.189
Too many open cases.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.536
I'll take my leave
in a couple weeks.

05:29.674 --> 05:30.571
All right.

05:32.297 --> 05:33.298
Are you sure you're okay?

05:33.436 --> 05:34.782
I have to pee
every five minutes,

05:34.920 --> 05:36.059
there's a stabbing pain
in both my hips,

05:36.197 --> 05:37.889
and I barely sleep,

05:38.027 --> 05:39.546
but I am glowing, right?

05:39.684 --> 05:41.548
Radiant.

05:41.686 --> 05:43.135
Thorsen.

05:44.447 --> 05:46.346
You're assigned
to Detective Lopez

05:46.484 --> 05:48.520
as her personal aide
until further notice.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.626
Yes, sir. Thank you.

05:51.489 --> 05:53.007
Don't thank me yet, son.

05:54.526 --> 05:56.528
Officer Thorsen,
at your service.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.185
What you need?

05:58.323 --> 05:59.359
Honestly?

05:59.497 --> 06:01.499
Antacids. Like, a lot.

06:01.637 --> 06:03.673
I bought this on my way in
to work this morning.

06:03.811 --> 06:04.812
You know, I don't think

06:04.950 --> 06:07.297
you're supposed to take
that many.

06:07.436 --> 06:08.816
Antacids it is.

06:08.954 --> 06:09.783
Need anything else
while I'm out?

06:09.921 --> 06:10.853
No.

06:10.991 --> 06:12.717
Uh, yes.

06:12.855 --> 06:14.926
Canned Chilorio, Sinaloa style.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.272
I don't think

06:16.410 --> 06:18.308
canned meat's gonna help
with your indigestion.

06:21.450 --> 06:22.554
On it. Yeah.

06:22.692 --> 06:24.142
- And a cherry soda.
- Got it.

06:26.765 --> 06:27.904
What?

06:29.147 --> 06:30.528
It's weird to be back.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.322
Yeah, well, at least it's
under better circumstances.

06:32.461 --> 06:34.152
Much.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.153
Bradford.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.086
Welcome back.

06:37.224 --> 06:39.053
Isabel?
- Hey, Smitty.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.779
I almost didn't recognize you
without the, uh--

06:40.917 --> 06:42.091
Greasy hair and track marks?

06:42.229 --> 06:43.541
No.

06:43.679 --> 06:45.025
I was gonna say the badge.

06:45.163 --> 06:47.061
Good to see you.

06:47.993 --> 06:48.891
"Welcome back"?

06:49.029 --> 06:50.064
Were you on vacation?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.549
No, I was on leave
for a shooting.

06:51.687 --> 06:52.688
I just got cleared.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.034
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:54.172 --> 06:56.346
Well, mostly.

06:56.485 --> 06:58.176
Lucy thinks
I should start meditating.

06:58.314 --> 07:00.350
I know, right?

07:03.112 --> 07:05.217
The famous Isabel.

07:05.355 --> 07:06.978
Yeah.

07:07.116 --> 07:08.358
You ever work with her?

07:08.497 --> 07:09.739
No, but I knew of her,

07:09.877 --> 07:12.984
first as a rock star UC,
then as a cautionary tale.

07:13.122 --> 07:14.295
Why is she back?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.021
Uh, and old case.

07:17.989 --> 07:19.231
You okay with that?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.544
Why wouldn't I be?

07:23.615 --> 07:25.134
It's not a big deal.

07:25.272 --> 07:27.343
I mean, he--he's over her.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.620
I know that.

07:28.758 --> 07:31.071
Just making sure you do.

07:31.209 --> 07:33.522
Totally. I--stop it.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.489
So I did a deep dive
on Isabel.

07:36.835 --> 07:38.147
Yeah--what deep dive?

07:38.285 --> 07:39.631
The one we talked about.

07:39.769 --> 07:41.840
I'm pretty sure she's single,
and she's working with

07:41.978 --> 07:44.671
a police officer
support network in Santa Fe

07:44.809 --> 07:46.258
while she gets a degree
in social work.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.536
See? I mean, it sounds like

07:47.674 --> 07:49.192
she's built
a whole new life for herself.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.711
This is amazing.
- Sure.

07:50.849 --> 07:52.679
Or she wants Tim to see
she's doing well.

07:53.818 --> 07:55.129
He did say she looked good.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.303
Look, it--okay.

07:56.441 --> 07:58.339
Why, then,
would she agree to meet

07:58.478 --> 07:59.858
and his new girlfriend's
apartment?

07:59.996 --> 08:01.239
Keep your enemies close.

08:01.377 --> 08:02.482
I'm just saying.

08:02.620 --> 08:03.828
Tamara...

08:03.966 --> 08:05.795
Chen, let's move.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.383
Dara's uncle's on his way in.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.833
Goodbye.

08:11.905 --> 08:13.216
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:14.079 --> 08:15.046
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.116
Where's your boot?
- Oh.

08:16.254 --> 08:17.324
Grey gave her a personal day.

08:17.462 --> 08:19.084
Rookies don't get
personal days.

08:19.222 --> 08:21.328
Well, I guess if anyone
deserves an exception,

08:21.466 --> 08:22.985
it is Juarez.

08:23.123 --> 08:24.711
Side note--got something.

08:24.849 --> 08:27.265
Bailey has a friend from
college visiting us right now.

08:27.403 --> 08:28.404
Oh, let me guess.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.579
They are partying
like it's 1999.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.442
I have never seen Bailey
so hungover.

08:32.581 --> 08:34.375
I have a friend like that.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.619
She texts me every Friday night
at midnight

08:36.757 --> 08:38.000
to ask me what I am up to

08:38.138 --> 08:40.623
as if I do not have
babies at home.

08:40.761 --> 08:42.314
All right, so when does
Princess Bad News leave?

08:42.452 --> 08:43.730
Tomorrow, which is good.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.490
I don't think Bailey's liver
can take another day.

08:45.628 --> 08:47.941
Oh.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.770
Do not answer that. Oh, you--

08:49.908 --> 08:52.152
Randy, is this another
butt dial?

08:52.290 --> 08:53.947
Nyla Harper, you jokester.

08:54.085 --> 08:56.225
I would never dial you
with my buttocks.

08:56.363 --> 08:59.228
No, I actually have a teensie,
tinsie frage for you.

08:59.366 --> 09:02.990
Hypothetically,
when is trespassing a crime?

09:03.128 --> 09:04.336
Always.

09:04.474 --> 09:05.752
But what if you're trying
to help somebody?

09:05.890 --> 09:07.926
Randy, I don't know how
to make this any clearer.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.652
Do not trespass.

09:09.790 --> 09:10.826
Okie-dokies.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.724
Danke schoen, my wisest friend.

09:13.207 --> 09:14.070
What was that about?

09:14.208 --> 09:15.969
I hope to never find out.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.282
Thanks for coming in.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.732
I'm Sergeant Bradford.

09:20.870 --> 09:24.287
We got a call this morning
about your niece Dara.

09:24.425 --> 09:27.221
Ugh,
Ed always gave me the creeps.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.258
He used to talk
directly to my chest.

09:29.396 --> 09:30.673
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

09:30.811 --> 09:32.675
I was trying to get a foothold.

09:32.813 --> 09:34.159
I needed him to like me.

09:34.297 --> 09:36.472
Said she seemed to be
in a bit of distress last night

09:36.610 --> 09:38.439
and hasn't been able
to get in touch with her since.

09:39.475 --> 09:41.995
I haven't seen her
since yesterday morning.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.169
She's 18; she comes and goes
as she pleases.

09:44.307 --> 09:45.550
What friend was this?

09:45.688 --> 09:47.310
I've got her name
written down over at my desk.

09:47.448 --> 09:48.484
Um, listen.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.485
What I'm trying
to figure out here--

09:49.623 --> 09:50.659
can you think of any place

09:50.797 --> 09:53.696
that Dara might like
to hang out?

09:53.834 --> 09:55.180
A boyfriend's house?

09:55.318 --> 09:56.768
Not that I know of.

09:58.149 --> 10:01.359
You sure this isn't just
an excuse to jam me up,

10:01.497 --> 10:02.360
business I'm in?

10:02.498 --> 10:03.706
No, sir. No.

10:03.844 --> 10:05.225
This is purely a welfare check
on your niece.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.537
You know, her dad gets
out of prison tomorrow.

10:07.676 --> 10:09.436
What's his relationship like
with her?

10:09.574 --> 10:10.679
Any strife
about him coming home?

10:10.817 --> 10:13.371
Nah, nah.
We're excited to have him back.

10:13.509 --> 10:14.648
Gonna throw a party.

10:14.786 --> 10:15.649
That's great.

10:15.787 --> 10:16.685
You did bring up your business.

10:16.823 --> 10:17.996
I mean, is there any chance

10:18.134 --> 10:20.033
that could be connected
to her disappearance?

10:20.171 --> 10:21.690
Look, you--

10:21.828 --> 10:23.830
you keep saying "disappeared."

10:23.968 --> 10:25.141
She's probably just
sleeping one off

10:25.279 --> 10:26.315
at a--at a friend's house.

10:26.453 --> 10:28.282
Of course. Yeah.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.594
Well, listen,
if you hear from her,

10:29.732 --> 10:31.941
uh, please give me a call.

10:33.322 --> 10:34.392
Okay?

10:36.014 --> 10:37.153
This way, Mr. Teska.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.501
Any chance we can get
a warrant on his phone?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.020
Not based on
what we have so far.

10:42.158 --> 10:43.332
You should talk to Frank,

10:43.470 --> 10:45.921
see if it's all one big,
happy family like Ed said.

10:49.303 --> 10:51.754
Hey, I need
a surefire hangover remedy.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.307
Uh, pickle juice.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.688
Harper says pickle juice.

10:54.826 --> 10:56.241
Thank you.
- What now?

10:56.379 --> 10:58.830
<i>Hypothetically, if a person
did end up trespassing</i>

10:58.968 --> 11:00.556
<i>and then found a dead body...</i>

11:00.694 --> 11:03.076
Whoa. Dead or murdered?

11:03.214 --> 11:06.355
Uh, hypothetically murdered.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.391
Okay, look.

11:08.529 --> 11:09.807
Whatever you do,
do not touch it.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.223
<i>In fact,
don't touch anything.</i>

11:12.361 --> 11:13.258
Oh!

11:13.396 --> 11:14.259
Especially if it looks like

11:14.397 --> 11:15.813
it was related to the crime.

11:16.952 --> 11:18.091
Ah!

11:19.506 --> 11:21.059
Uh, h--

11:21.197 --> 11:22.267
h-hypothetically,

11:22.405 --> 11:25.512
if I, uh, fell
in the man's blood...

11:25.650 --> 11:27.203
Okay, seriously,
what is going on?

11:27.341 --> 11:28.584
Randy broke into
someone's house,

11:28.722 --> 11:30.690
found a murdered man,
and then fell in his blood.

11:30.828 --> 11:31.760
Hypothetically.

11:31.898 --> 11:32.795
Police!

11:32.933 --> 11:34.072
Show me your hands!

11:34.970 --> 11:37.282
- Right there.
- Nyla, I have to go.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.870
Don't move.

11:42.598 --> 11:43.599
Cut it out.

11:44.842 --> 11:46.015
Oh, there you are!

11:46.153 --> 11:47.499
Meine bestest freunde.

11:47.637 --> 11:48.984
- Hey, Randy.
- You know this nutjob?

11:49.122 --> 11:50.951
I do, which is why
I need to ask for a favor.

11:52.228 --> 11:53.402
Let me take over this case.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.403
Oh, forget it.

11:54.541 --> 11:55.542
Easiest solve I ever had.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.612
I'm not just gonna
hand it to you.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.717
Yeah, he didn't do it.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.028
Like hell, he didn't.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.547
We have been communicating
with him all day.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.998
This is just a really bad case
of wrong place, wrong time.

12:03.136 --> 12:03.999
Oh, no, no, no.

12:04.137 --> 12:05.000
I am excellent with time.

12:05.138 --> 12:06.173
I'm German.
- Randy.

12:06.311 --> 12:07.692
You're not helping.

12:07.830 --> 12:08.693
Please.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.108
Look, in exchange, I will take

12:10.246 --> 12:11.489
something else
off of your plate.

12:11.627 --> 12:13.525
What--what's a case that has
been giving you grief?

12:18.289 --> 12:19.531
NoHo Doe.

12:19.669 --> 12:20.532
Mm.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.051
Ooh, that sounds fun.

12:22.189 --> 12:23.639
What's a NoHo Doe?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.986
A torso found in a vacant lot

12:26.124 --> 12:27.816
with no definitive
cause of death,

12:27.954 --> 12:31.198
no witnesses,
and no way to ID him.

12:31.336 --> 12:33.338
You give us this case,

12:33.476 --> 12:35.271
I will take NoHo Doe.

12:37.653 --> 12:38.688
Deal.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.209
Dieter's all yours.

12:42.347 --> 12:43.314
It's Randy.

12:43.452 --> 12:44.798
Dieter was my uncle.

12:44.936 --> 12:46.696
He is not
a very good detective.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.560
What's up, guys?
What's the haps?

12:48.698 --> 12:50.148
Randy, we need you
to tell us everything

12:50.286 --> 12:51.874
about why you were in
this house.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.807
Don't answer that.

12:53.945 --> 12:55.222
What are you doing here?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.776
Representing my client.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.432
Monica is your lawyer?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.055
How do you two
even know each other?

13:00.193 --> 13:02.747
He's helped me track down
a few...

13:02.885 --> 13:04.438
hard to locate witnesses.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.993
Oh, yeah,
that guy was hard to find,

13:07.131 --> 13:08.166
but no one hides

13:08.304 --> 13:10.513
from the fingers
of Skip Tracer Randy.

13:10.651 --> 13:11.618
Look,
we're just treating Randy

13:11.756 --> 13:12.999
as a witness in this case,

13:13.137 --> 13:14.828
not as a suspect.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.520
We just want him to tell us
what he knows.

13:17.658 --> 13:19.833
That's fine,
as long as I'm present.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.078
My freedom's been restored.

13:23.216 --> 13:25.287
What should I do with
this second chance at life?

13:25.425 --> 13:26.702
Eat a ghost pepper?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.498
Oh, declare my secret love
to an unsuspecting friend?

13:29.636 --> 13:30.740
Definitely not the last one.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.708
Oh, just the ghost pepper, then.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.227
Okay, so what's next?

13:34.365 --> 13:35.745
Interdepartmental meeting.

13:35.884 --> 13:37.678
I've been looking forward to it
all morning.

13:39.163 --> 13:40.440
The chairs are super comfy,

13:40.578 --> 13:42.200
and the donuts are heaven.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.237
I mean, you could always
just buy yourself donuts.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.721
Free donuts taste better.

13:49.449 --> 13:50.553
Oh, crap.

13:50.691 --> 13:51.554
What?

13:51.692 --> 13:53.418
They switched the location.

13:53.556 --> 13:55.213
To where?

13:57.319 --> 13:58.492
Oh.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.425
I can do this.

14:00.563 --> 14:01.944
- Yeah, you can do this.
- Yeah.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.196
I can't do this.

14:12.334 --> 14:13.404
Okay, you know what?

14:13.542 --> 14:14.715
How 'bout I just go
and grab you a donut

14:14.854 --> 14:15.751
and I can FaceTime you
in the meeting?

14:15.889 --> 14:16.821
Deal.

14:16.959 --> 14:17.857
Yeah.

14:25.761 --> 14:27.314
You know what?
Uh... I got you.

14:27.452 --> 14:28.419
Yeah.

14:28.557 --> 14:30.076
- I met her at a bar.
- Met who?

14:30.214 --> 14:31.663
The woman who hired me.

14:32.354 --> 14:33.562
To do what?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.667
Randy, just pretend
like we don't know anything.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.083
Right. Okay.

14:37.221 --> 14:39.913
So a bar is a place
where people--

14:40.051 --> 14:41.225
I'm giving him back
to Scanlon.

14:41.363 --> 14:42.882
Hold on.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.437
Randy, I know linear thinking
is difficult,

14:46.575 --> 14:47.403
but try.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.889
Emily Johnson.

14:50.027 --> 14:53.237
She'd read online about my fame
as a skip tracer bounty hunter

14:53.375 --> 14:54.479
and asked to meet me.

14:54.617 --> 14:56.481
- At a bar.
- Exactly. Yeah.

14:56.619 --> 14:58.552
She told me she was being
stalked by a man

14:58.690 --> 15:00.002
named Nelson Friske,

15:00.140 --> 15:01.831
and would I scare
the bejesus out of him?

15:01.970 --> 15:03.488
I don't know who is
this "BeJesus,"

15:03.626 --> 15:04.904
but is he, like,
from the sequel?

15:05.042 --> 15:06.181
Uh, yes.

15:06.319 --> 15:08.942
Okay, so you showed up
at Nelson Friske's house,

15:09.080 --> 15:10.219
and he was already dead?

15:10.357 --> 15:11.324
Oh, as a dormouse.

15:11.462 --> 15:12.877
Who exactly is Nelson Friske?

15:13.015 --> 15:14.430
A 43-year-old day trader

15:14.568 --> 15:17.054
with a prolific side hobby
of being an internet troll.

15:17.192 --> 15:19.573
Oh, so potentially
dozens of suspects.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.368
Yes, which is why
we need to find

15:21.506 --> 15:22.680
this Emily Johnson.

15:22.818 --> 15:24.233
Do you have a phone number
for her?

15:24.371 --> 15:25.579
- Yeah, I can send to you.
- Great.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.857
Now you go home.
But why?

15:27.996 --> 15:30.170
I want to be with you guys,
my partners.

15:30.308 --> 15:32.897
Sorry, Randy, you're just
too close to this one.

15:33.035 --> 15:35.520
So I think, legally,
it's best for you

15:35.658 --> 15:38.351
just to sit at home and wait
for us to unravel this mystery.

15:38.489 --> 15:40.836
He's right. Go home.
Stay out of trouble.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.562
Of course,

15:42.700 --> 15:44.529
because trouble
is not my middle name.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.566
It's actually Randy.
Randy Randy.

15:46.704 --> 15:47.981
Yeah. If anyone cares.

15:48.119 --> 15:50.328
So how long
you been dating Lucy?

15:51.674 --> 15:53.262
- A few months.
- Mm.

15:54.539 --> 15:56.334
Are you seeing anyone?

15:56.472 --> 15:58.440
I was, and then I wasn't.

15:58.578 --> 16:00.718
And then I wa--
you know the drill.

16:00.856 --> 16:01.961
They were nice.

16:02.099 --> 16:04.239
It just--
you set the bar really high.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.071
Here we go.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.452
Frank Teska.

16:10.590 --> 16:11.832
I'm Sergeant Tim Bradford.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.455
I'm in charge
of locating your daughter.

16:13.593 --> 16:15.388
She's missing.
<i>- What do you mean, missing?</i>

16:15.526 --> 16:17.459
You talk to my brother, Ed?
<i>- I did.</i>

16:17.597 --> 16:18.908
<i>He said he hasn't seen her
since yesterday.</i>

16:19.047 --> 16:20.324
<i>Has she been in contact
with you at all?</i>

16:20.462 --> 16:22.291
Not recently.

16:23.465 --> 16:25.639
I get a card at Christmas.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.572
Not for Father's Day, though.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.815
Can't say I blame her.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.299
Can you think of anywhere
she might go

16:30.437 --> 16:31.852
when she's upset?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.682
<i>I don't know.</i>

16:33.820 --> 16:35.442
<i>I mean, who'd go after Dara?</i>

16:35.580 --> 16:36.892
<i>She's never hurt anyone.</i>

16:37.030 --> 16:38.514
Yeah, I mean, you've made
a lot of powerful enemies.

16:38.652 --> 16:39.722
Is there any chance

16:39.860 --> 16:42.173
someone's trying
to get to you through her?

16:42.311 --> 16:43.519
<i>No one would dare.</i>

16:44.313 --> 16:45.935
Okay.
Well, if you think of anything.

16:46.074 --> 16:47.351
<i>She's a good kid.</i>

16:48.490 --> 16:50.181
<i>She deserves better than...</i>

16:52.425 --> 16:53.460
<i>Find her.</i>

16:53.598 --> 16:54.875
Yeah, we're doing
everything we can.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.463
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

16:58.017 --> 16:59.708
How long
till he makes the call?

16:59.846 --> 17:01.399
<i>Sergeant, I have the tap</i>

17:01.537 --> 17:03.574
<i>on that call
from the prison to Ed Teska.</i>

17:03.712 --> 17:05.196
Patch it through.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.542
<i>Where the hell's
my daughter?</i>

17:06.680 --> 17:07.854
<i>Police are telling me
she's missing.</i>

17:07.992 --> 17:09.028
<i>Relax.</i>

17:09.166 --> 17:10.684
<i>She's a teenager.
She'll turn up.</i>

17:10.822 --> 17:12.031
<i>When I'm out of here tomorrow,</i>

17:12.169 --> 17:13.618
<i>you and I are gonna
have to have a talk.</i>

17:13.756 --> 17:15.689
<i>I'm hearing things,
and I'm not happy.</i>

17:15.827 --> 17:17.174
<i>Stop listening
to the rumors.</i>

17:17.312 --> 17:18.313
<i>People are trying
to come between us.</i>

17:18.451 --> 17:19.348
<i>Don't let 'em.</i>

17:19.486 --> 17:20.763
<i>Find my kid.</i>

17:22.110 --> 17:23.180
Well, maybe
Ed's telling the truth.

17:23.318 --> 17:24.491
Maybe he doesn't know
where Dara is.

17:24.629 --> 17:27.011
Maybe, but he is
a professional liar.

17:27.149 --> 17:29.669
He once had Frank convinced
someone greenlit a hit on him.

17:29.807 --> 17:31.671
Had him running
from his shadow.

17:32.913 --> 17:33.776
The motel.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.019
What?

17:35.157 --> 17:36.469
When Frank thought
he'd been greenlit,

17:36.607 --> 17:37.987
he told me to take Dara
somewhere safe

17:38.126 --> 17:39.127
while he dealt with it.

17:39.265 --> 17:40.921
We stayed at a motel
by the beach.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.095
Maybe she's there.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.683
Okay.

17:43.821 --> 17:46.617
So the number Randy gave us
for Emily was a fake.

17:46.755 --> 17:48.446
Well, then I'm guessing
her name was fake too.

17:48.584 --> 17:50.586
Well, if she is
one of Nelson's victims,

17:50.724 --> 17:52.519
a fake name would make sense.

17:52.657 --> 17:54.073
She wouldn't want us
to track her

17:54.211 --> 17:55.798
through her online communications.

17:55.936 --> 17:57.800
But then why involve Randy?

17:57.938 --> 17:59.216
To create reasonable doubt?

17:59.354 --> 18:01.045
I mean, it wouldn't even
have to be a good frame job

18:01.183 --> 18:02.115
in order for it to work.

18:02.253 --> 18:03.530
All her lawyer would have to do

18:03.668 --> 18:06.257
is point to the 6'4" German man
found at the crime scene

18:06.395 --> 18:08.087
covered in the victim's blood.

18:08.225 --> 18:09.950
Oh, speaking of.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.090
Huh.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.230
Tell me you are at home.

18:13.368 --> 18:15.439
Are you familiar with
the Britney Spears classic

18:15.577 --> 18:16.888
"Oops!...I Did It Again"?

18:19.201 --> 18:20.444
Uh, I have to go.

18:20.582 --> 18:22.066
I'll see you
back at the station.

18:22.204 --> 18:23.516
Let me see your hands!

18:23.654 --> 18:25.034
Again.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.174
Hey, friends.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.385
Randy, you're making it
very difficult

18:30.523 --> 18:31.903
for us to not prosecute you.

18:32.041 --> 18:34.596
I was just trying to help
you guys find the real killer.

18:34.734 --> 18:37.426
If you find a lead,
just text us.

18:37.564 --> 18:40.740
The good news is, we know
that fake Emily's real name

18:40.878 --> 18:42.017
is Ariel Riser.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.261
Uniforms found
$5,000 in cash

18:44.399 --> 18:46.021
in her bedroom,
along with a note

18:46.159 --> 18:47.264
that had your phone number
on it.

18:47.402 --> 18:49.473
Mm, so someone paid her
to frame my client

18:49.611 --> 18:51.026
and then killed her
to cover their tracks?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.683
Yes, that is
what it looks like.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.685
But the question is, why Randy?

18:54.823 --> 18:56.031
Was he just a patsy,

18:56.169 --> 18:57.688
or does our killer hold
a grudge against him too?

18:57.826 --> 18:59.068
Why would anyone have
a grudge

18:59.207 --> 19:00.829
against Skip Tracer Randy?

19:00.967 --> 19:02.486
Everybody loves me.
- Right.

19:02.624 --> 19:04.488
But pretending they don't,

19:04.626 --> 19:06.628
why don't you give us a list
of all your bounties

19:06.766 --> 19:08.457
and skip traces
from the past five years?

19:08.595 --> 19:09.941
Hopefully, one of the names
on that list

19:10.079 --> 19:11.702
will match one
of Nelson's victims,

19:11.840 --> 19:13.082
and we will have our killer.

19:13.221 --> 19:14.774
Great,
and I will start looking

19:14.912 --> 19:16.258
at Nelson's social media.

19:16.396 --> 19:17.259
No, you will not.

19:17.397 --> 19:18.364
You will get us that list,

19:18.502 --> 19:19.744
and then you will go home.

19:19.882 --> 19:23.645
Randy, as your lawyer,
I'm begging you to stay there.

19:23.783 --> 19:25.094
God, you are no funs.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.648
You are zero with the funs.

19:26.786 --> 19:29.271
You're like a monkey
allergic to bananas.

19:30.065 --> 19:31.515
Please remind me
why we had to drive

19:31.653 --> 19:33.551
all the way to this
specific coffee cart

19:33.689 --> 19:35.519
instead of the one
five minutes from my bed.

19:35.657 --> 19:37.348
Because they have
a liquor license,

19:37.486 --> 19:38.556
and it...

19:38.694 --> 19:39.695
Hi.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.145
Oh, hang on.

19:41.283 --> 19:42.526
Please tell me we did not come
all the way here

19:42.664 --> 19:43.872
so you could meet up
with some guy.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.356
What?
We've been chatting online,

19:45.494 --> 19:47.496
and he asked if we could meet.

19:47.634 --> 19:49.118
Is that why you came to LA?

19:49.257 --> 19:50.844
No!

19:50.982 --> 19:51.949
Oh, come on, Bails, please.

19:52.087 --> 19:53.157
I need this.

19:53.295 --> 19:55.194
- What about your husband?
- Ugh, whatever.

19:55.332 --> 19:57.126
Roger's in love
with his physical therapist.

19:59.094 --> 20:00.958
Okay, fine.
- Yes.

20:01.096 --> 20:02.235
But I'm staying here
with you.

20:02.373 --> 20:03.581
I'm not having you get murdered

20:03.719 --> 20:05.687
by some random man
you met on the internet.

20:05.825 --> 20:07.654
You are the best.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.138
Grab us some margaritas?

20:12.866 --> 20:14.247
Dara and I stayed here
for a week.

20:14.385 --> 20:16.939
We ate junk food,
swam in the ocean,

20:17.077 --> 20:18.562
danced on the bed.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.357
I know it doesn't sound
like much,

20:20.495 --> 20:23.049
but when you're spending
every second of the day

20:23.187 --> 20:25.810
on high alert, waiting
for it all to go sideways,

20:25.948 --> 20:29.089
it--it feels good
just to breathe.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.540
I get it...

20:31.678 --> 20:34.336
'cause I held my breath

20:34.474 --> 20:37.270
every time you left
on a long-term assignment.

20:37.408 --> 20:39.376
And then you'd come home, and...

20:39.514 --> 20:42.413
And I'd still be gone
in my head,

20:42.551 --> 20:45.105
no matter how much
I wanted to be there with you.

20:48.661 --> 20:51.146
Anyway, um, so is that escape

20:51.284 --> 20:52.596
why you think
Dara will come here?

20:52.734 --> 20:53.942
I don't know.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.081
I could be projecting.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.014
It just--she was scared.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.362
She--she called me
for a reason.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.020
Maybe it's 'cause
this is where she felt safe.

21:03.158 --> 21:04.815
Okay, well,
if she does come here,

21:04.953 --> 21:06.161
you're gonna need backup,
all right?

21:06.299 --> 21:07.162
You're not a cop anymore--

21:07.300 --> 21:08.474
no gun, no badge--

21:08.612 --> 21:10.441
so Lucy's on her way here.

21:10.579 --> 21:12.995
I can't believe, after
everything I put you through,

21:13.133 --> 21:14.894
you're dating another UC.

21:15.032 --> 21:15.895
I know.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.243
But Lucy's different.

21:19.381 --> 21:21.141
She isn't a junky in waiting?

21:22.177 --> 21:23.592
You know
that is not what I meant.

21:23.730 --> 21:25.698
I know, I just--

21:25.836 --> 21:28.804
seeing you again brings it all
back up, you know?

21:28.942 --> 21:30.289
I do.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.602
I still have not
been able to find

21:33.740 --> 21:35.294
a connection between Friske
and Randy.

21:35.432 --> 21:36.295
What about you?

21:36.433 --> 21:38.089
Uh, no, but I did make a list

21:38.227 --> 21:39.574
of all the people
that Friske was trolling

21:39.712 --> 21:40.713
who seem most likely
to kill him.

21:40.851 --> 21:41.921
Who's at the top?

21:42.059 --> 21:43.302
Brian Cole.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.925
He is an accountant
from Glendale.

21:46.063 --> 21:48.272
Friske hacked Cole's
dead wife's ClipTalk account

21:48.410 --> 21:50.170
to send him taunting messages.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.793
- That's sick.
- Yeah.

21:51.931 --> 21:53.519
But he has an airtight alibi.

21:53.657 --> 21:54.934
Next on the list are

21:55.072 --> 21:56.867
a chef in Venice
whose restaurant closed

21:57.005 --> 21:58.765
after Friske posted
a wave of fake reviews

21:58.903 --> 22:01.181
and a gym owner in Hollywood
who lost his wife

22:01.320 --> 22:03.908
after Friske leaked DMs
he'd sent to a female employee.

22:04.046 --> 22:05.496
- Mm.
- Hey, Nolan.

22:05.634 --> 22:06.911
You're fiancée's here.

22:07.049 --> 22:08.982
- Oh, great. Uh, reception?
- Holding.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.122
Just got brought in
for being drunk in public.

22:11.260 --> 22:12.296
Mm.

22:13.780 --> 22:14.781
Excuse me.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.715
Uh, hey, why haven't you
arrested Randy yet?

22:17.853 --> 22:19.268
He's been found
at two murder scenes.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.029
Okay, I know from the outside
it doesn't make any sense--

22:21.167 --> 22:22.375
To the DA, it looks like

22:22.513 --> 22:23.928
you took Scanlon's case
to help out a friend.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.896
Tell the DA
to come say that to my face.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.312
Look, I know that's not
what's happening here,

22:28.450 --> 22:31.350
but if you don't make some
headway on a new suspect soon,

22:31.488 --> 22:33.075
the DA's talking about
going over your head.

22:33.213 --> 22:34.698
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.562
Of course. Where's Angela?

22:36.700 --> 22:37.735
Uh, lunch.

22:37.873 --> 22:38.909
Again.

22:40.289 --> 22:41.463
Again.

22:41.601 --> 22:44.017
Thank you.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.053
Hey.

22:45.191 --> 22:46.192
Hey.
- What happened?

22:46.330 --> 22:47.918
Libby took me on her date

22:48.056 --> 22:49.540
with a guy she met
on the internet.

22:49.678 --> 22:51.093
He turned out to be a creep.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.681
She started throwing fists

22:52.819 --> 22:54.959
and ran away
when the cops showed up.

22:55.097 --> 22:57.237
Okay, I'm starting to think
that maybe

22:57.376 --> 22:59.170
Libby isn't the greatest friend
to have around.

22:59.308 --> 23:00.206
I know.

23:00.344 --> 23:01.518
I'm just so tired,

23:01.656 --> 23:02.829
and I just really want
to go home and sleep.

23:02.967 --> 23:05.004
I'm so sorry. Um...

23:05.142 --> 23:06.385
Randy, this really isn't
a good time.

23:06.523 --> 23:08.421
John, I found the killer!

23:08.559 --> 23:10.389
I'm in the trunk of his car
right now!

23:13.599 --> 23:15.670
Randy combed through
Friske's troll accounts

23:15.808 --> 23:17.775
and came to the same conclusion
I did.

23:17.913 --> 23:19.674
Brian Cole is a prime suspect.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.539
Except for the fact that
Cole has an airtight alibi.

23:22.677 --> 23:24.092
Exactly,
but Randy didn't know that.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.646
So he went to Brian's house
to "gather evidence,"

23:26.784 --> 23:27.820
and...

23:27.958 --> 23:29.546
Hid in the trunk of Brian's car

23:29.684 --> 23:31.099
when Brian came out
to take out the trash,

23:31.237 --> 23:32.100
and now he's stuck in there.

23:32.238 --> 23:33.412
Kay.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.312
Is that the car?
- That's him.

23:39.072 --> 23:41.350
Okay, we gotta get him
out of there on the DL.

23:41.489 --> 23:43.249
Otherwise,
the DA is gonna flip out,

23:43.387 --> 23:45.596
have the case reassigned,
and throw the book at Randy.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.874
I might have an idea.

24:01.854 --> 24:02.717
How you doing, sir?

24:02.855 --> 24:04.235
Uh, good afternoon, Officer.

24:04.373 --> 24:06.548
License and registration, please.

24:06.686 --> 24:07.963
So we received a call

24:08.101 --> 24:10.897
saying that you swerved
over the double yellow line.

24:11.035 --> 24:12.381
Have you been drinking today, sir?

24:12.520 --> 24:13.797
- Absolutely not.
- Okay, great.

24:13.935 --> 24:15.523
Can you step out of the car, please?

24:15.661 --> 24:16.972
Sure.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.528
Front of the car.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.116
I'm gonna give you
a little field sobriety test.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.532
Oh, that's not necessary.

24:24.670 --> 24:25.843
Stand on your left foot, please.

24:27.431 --> 24:28.328
Yep. Ah, ah, ah.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.261
Eyes on me, sir.

24:30.399 --> 24:32.436
Can you recite the alphabet backwards,

24:32.574 --> 24:34.403
only saying every other letter?

24:35.922 --> 24:38.062
Um... uh, Z...

24:38.200 --> 24:39.961
- Uh-huh.
- X...

24:40.099 --> 24:41.272
Wow, this is exciting.

24:41.410 --> 24:42.411
Shh. Stay down.

24:42.550 --> 24:43.551
Noted.

24:47.244 --> 24:48.590
- V...
- Yeah.

24:48.728 --> 24:51.179
T...

24:51.317 --> 24:52.836
- Leg up, please.
- Oh, higher?

24:52.974 --> 24:53.871
Yeah. P...
- Yeah.

24:54.009 --> 24:55.424
- Uh...
- All right.

24:55.563 --> 24:56.529
Thank you.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.738
Does that--
does that mean I can go?

24:58.876 --> 24:59.808
Uh, yeah.

24:59.946 --> 25:01.776
Uh, drive safe out there.
- Okay.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.823
Wow, that was thrilling!

25:14.961 --> 25:17.550
I felt like Thomas Cruise
in "Missions Impossible."

25:17.688 --> 25:19.966
Do you have any idea
how stupid that was?

25:20.104 --> 25:21.002
- No.
- We already

25:21.140 --> 25:22.072
looked into this guy.

25:22.210 --> 25:23.349
He had nothing to do
with the murder.

25:23.487 --> 25:24.488
Okay,
I know you want to help,

25:24.626 --> 25:26.007
but involving yourself
with this case

25:26.145 --> 25:28.216
will only give the prosecution
more ammunition

25:28.354 --> 25:29.907
against you at trial.

25:30.045 --> 25:31.391
Wait, does this mean
I have to go home again?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.910
Oh, absolutely not. No.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.809
Obviously,
you cannot be trusted

25:34.947 --> 25:37.018
to stay out of trouble,
so you are coming with us.

25:37.156 --> 25:39.054
Whoo-hoo! Reunited partners!

25:40.677 --> 25:42.057
Uh, when am I issued
a service weapon?

25:42.195 --> 25:43.093
Oh, my God.

25:43.231 --> 25:44.301
Oh, here she is.

25:44.439 --> 25:46.061
All right,
be careful out there, okay?

25:46.199 --> 25:47.546
You haven't seen Dara
in eight years.

25:47.684 --> 25:48.823
You don't know
what she's gotten herself into.

25:48.961 --> 25:50.169
She's not a kid anymore.

25:50.307 --> 25:51.688
And it's been a minute
since you've done this.

25:51.826 --> 25:53.931
Yes, sir.
Always the protector.

25:57.694 --> 25:58.557
- You wired up?
- Yeah.

25:58.695 --> 25:59.730
The receiver's in my car.

26:04.977 --> 26:06.150
Hey. Thanks for helping out.

26:06.288 --> 26:07.496
Yeah, of course.

26:08.152 --> 26:09.429
You have a history
that might work here?

26:09.568 --> 26:10.810
I've got a backstory
that puts me

26:10.948 --> 26:12.640
in Chowchilla for two years.

26:12.778 --> 26:14.331
Let's go with that
if we have to,

26:14.469 --> 26:15.332
say we met there.

26:15.470 --> 26:16.505
Done.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.339
<i>I gotta admit,</i>

26:22.477 --> 26:24.997
<i>I was hoping to, uh,
pick your brain a bit.</i>

26:33.695 --> 26:35.455
You want to know
my cheat codes for dating Tim?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.698
What? No!

26:36.836 --> 26:37.837
No.

26:37.975 --> 26:38.838
I've got him all figured out.

26:40.737 --> 26:45.017
No, I wanted to ask you
about your time undercover.

26:45.155 --> 26:47.536
I mean, you are a legend.
- Hmm.

26:47.675 --> 26:50.781
The cases you closed,
the people you put away.

26:52.127 --> 26:54.509
I know it didn't end
the way you wanted.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.580
No, it, uh--it didn't.

26:56.718 --> 26:57.857
I'm sorry.

26:57.995 --> 26:59.065
I...

27:00.135 --> 27:02.241
I guess
what I'm trying to ask is,

27:02.379 --> 27:06.763
with all the bad things
that can and did happen,

27:06.901 --> 27:07.936
um...

27:08.074 --> 27:09.420
You want to know
if it was worth it?

27:10.836 --> 27:11.699
Yeah.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.562
Yeah, um...

27:13.701 --> 27:16.738
honestly, I--
I can't answer that.

27:16.876 --> 27:18.050
Mm.

27:18.188 --> 27:21.156
Being undercover derailed
my entire life.

27:21.294 --> 27:24.366
I--I lost my husband,

27:24.504 --> 27:26.955
my job, my self-respect.

27:27.093 --> 27:29.820
Almost lost my life.

27:29.958 --> 27:32.581
But I--I can't put all that
on being a UC.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.859
Plenty of people make it out

27:33.997 --> 27:36.620
without becoming
a full-blown addict.

27:36.758 --> 27:37.759
There were just--
there were things

27:37.897 --> 27:40.728
from my past that--
anyway, I, um...

27:40.866 --> 27:42.143
from what Tim tells me,

27:42.281 --> 27:45.456
you have much healthier
coping mechanisms.

27:45.594 --> 27:46.941
Being a UC is hard.

27:47.079 --> 27:48.149
You have to keep secrets

27:48.287 --> 27:50.220
from the people
that are closest to you,

27:50.358 --> 27:53.637
and you live in this constant
state of fight or flight.

27:53.775 --> 27:56.640
That wears on your
relationships no matter what,

27:56.778 --> 27:59.194
but if you go in
with your eyes open

27:59.332 --> 28:02.957
and you're prepared
to make those sacrifices,

28:03.095 --> 28:04.613
your experience might be
different than mine.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.271
I hope it is.

28:10.619 --> 28:12.311
Yeah, unis brought
this guy in.

28:12.449 --> 28:14.727
He's suspected of attacking
his boss with a bat.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.936
Suspect wore a ski mask,
no DNA,

28:17.074 --> 28:18.731
but the boss is convinced
it's him.

28:18.869 --> 28:19.974
So we need a confession.

28:20.112 --> 28:21.285
That would be ideal.

28:28.292 --> 28:29.984
Good afternoon, Mr. Hayden.

28:30.122 --> 28:31.364
I just have a few questions,

28:31.502 --> 28:32.883
and we'll have you out of here
as soon as possible.

28:33.021 --> 28:34.954
I didn't do anything.

28:35.092 --> 28:36.611
Hold that thought.

28:43.445 --> 28:44.895
- What's wrong?
- Gotta pee.

28:48.209 --> 28:50.314
<i>♪ We got a good thing
going on tonight ♪</i>

28:52.800 --> 28:54.318
Where were you
at the time of the attack?

28:54.456 --> 28:56.079
Uh, the bathroom.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.807
<i>♪ We got them good vibes ♪</i>

28:59.945 --> 29:01.567

29:38.224 --> 29:39.363

29:48.683 --> 29:49.891
How would you characterize

29:50.029 --> 29:51.341
your relationship
with your boss?

29:52.721 --> 29:55.069
Uh... uh, normal.

29:55.207 --> 29:57.071
I mean,
you know how bosses can be.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.589
Hold that thought.

29:58.727 --> 30:00.315
I have to pee again.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.801
It was me!
I attacked him.

30:02.939 --> 30:04.561
He called me an idiot,
so I went and got a bat.

30:04.699 --> 30:06.632
Just please
let me out of this room!

30:06.770 --> 30:07.840
Great. Let me get some paper

30:07.978 --> 30:09.359
so we can write up
your statement.

30:09.497 --> 30:10.394
Mm.

30:10.532 --> 30:11.602
<i>How 'bout I get it?</i>

30:17.712 --> 30:19.369
<i>♪ We got a good thing
going on tonight ♪</i>

30:21.578 --> 30:24.029
The Venn diagram
of the people Randy knows

30:24.167 --> 30:26.031
and the people he annoys
is a circle.

30:26.169 --> 30:28.136
Yeah, but who did he annoy
enough to want him dead?

30:28.274 --> 30:29.413
That's the tricky part.

30:29.551 --> 30:31.657
Wh--hey, did we say
you could get up?

30:31.795 --> 30:33.452
It is so boring over there.

30:33.590 --> 30:34.418
I think I could be
more helpful here...

30:35.695 --> 30:37.387
Working the case
with my partners.

30:37.525 --> 30:38.422
Where do we start?

30:38.560 --> 30:39.596
Randy, who just texted you?

30:39.734 --> 30:41.529
Oh, it's from
my friend Cooper.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.393
Cooper Logue? He owns a gym?

30:43.531 --> 30:44.532
Ja! You know the Coops?

30:44.670 --> 30:46.120
Is that the guy
that Nelson doxed

30:46.258 --> 30:47.569
for sexting his employees?

30:47.707 --> 30:49.606
Yes.
Randy, what did he text you?

30:49.744 --> 30:50.779
Oh.

30:50.918 --> 30:53.472
Oh, just a hilarious
indoor joke.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.681
Yeah, Randy,
that's the symbol for death.

30:55.819 --> 30:57.407
He's actually threatening you.

30:57.545 --> 30:59.064
Oh, no, that is ridiculous.

30:59.202 --> 31:00.720
We play pickleball together.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.446
He sends me this emoji
to let me know

31:02.584 --> 31:04.207
that I killed it on the court.

31:04.345 --> 31:05.622
He is such a good sport.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.556
I've defeated him,
I think, 21 times in a row,

31:08.694 --> 31:10.834
and he does not mind at all.

31:13.975 --> 31:14.873
Oh.
- Mm.

31:15.011 --> 31:16.357
I see now.

31:16.495 --> 31:18.669
Context is very important.

31:20.637 --> 31:22.777
I think Cooper Logue
is the one who wants me dead.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.366
Randy, I think
you might be right.

31:25.504 --> 31:26.677
Do you know
where we can find him?

31:26.815 --> 31:27.955
- I do.
- The only problem is,

31:28.093 --> 31:29.473
we don't have any hard evidence

31:29.611 --> 31:30.992
tying him to either murder.

31:31.130 --> 31:33.408
What if he tried to kill me?

31:33.546 --> 31:35.341
Hmm? I will be your decoy duck.

31:35.479 --> 31:36.791
No, Randy, we can't do that.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.413
Oh, come on. Just say yes.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.622
I will go there,
get him all riled up,

31:40.760 --> 31:42.003
say provocative things,

31:42.141 --> 31:43.971
get his angry juices flowing.

31:44.109 --> 31:45.041
No need.

31:45.179 --> 31:46.974
I think you can just
be yourself.

31:47.112 --> 31:49.252
Oh, really?
You think that would do it?

31:49.390 --> 31:51.288
I got a great feeling
about this.

31:53.256 --> 31:54.429
There he is.

31:56.052 --> 31:57.985
I wouldn't have pegged him
for a pickleball guy,

31:58.123 --> 31:59.814
but all right.
- You ready to do this?

32:00.919 --> 32:01.989
Ready.

32:09.479 --> 32:10.411
Really think
he'll take the bait?

32:10.549 --> 32:11.791
Hey, Cooper!

32:11.930 --> 32:13.690
Ready for Randy
to hand you your hintern again?

32:13.828 --> 32:15.243
Yeah! What's up, man?

32:15.381 --> 32:16.727
I'm gonna treat you
like Seabiscuit ri--

32:16.865 --> 32:17.728
Oh.

32:17.866 --> 32:19.075
Well, there's your answer.

32:23.769 --> 32:25.460
Hey, drop the German!

32:25.598 --> 32:26.841
Put the German down!

32:29.533 --> 32:31.708
<i>Hey, you get the issue
with the wire sorted out?</i>

32:31.846 --> 32:33.330
Yeah, we're all good.

32:33.468 --> 32:35.194
It got disconnected somehow.

32:36.609 --> 32:38.404
<i>- Check, one, two.</i>
- All right, got you.

32:39.474 --> 32:40.475
There's Dara.

32:40.613 --> 32:41.856
Babe, we gotta go.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.478
Time for you
to put Nikki back on.

32:43.616 --> 32:44.721
Let's see if I still got it.

33:01.151 --> 33:02.981
Hey, it's Nikki.

33:03.119 --> 33:04.292
Look at you.

33:04.430 --> 33:05.397
You're all grown up.

33:05.535 --> 33:06.639
I didn't think
you'd actually come.

33:06.777 --> 33:08.641
Well, I'm here.
You gonna let us in?

33:09.401 --> 33:11.092
- Who's she?
- Amber.

33:11.230 --> 33:14.820
Nik brought me for, uh...
emotional support.

33:14.958 --> 33:17.478
Your message made it sound
like things were poppin' off.

33:17.616 --> 33:19.066
Thought we could use
some backup.

33:28.351 --> 33:30.767
So how do you guys know
each other?

33:31.699 --> 33:33.528
I did a stint in Chowchilla.

33:34.943 --> 33:36.048
That's where you've been
all these years?

33:36.186 --> 33:37.360
For part of it.

33:37.498 --> 33:39.327
Listen, I know I left
without saying goodbye,

33:39.465 --> 33:41.157
but when your old man
got busted,

33:41.295 --> 33:43.400
I had to bounce, or I would've
been picked up too.

33:43.538 --> 33:44.539
I didn't have a choice.

33:44.677 --> 33:45.954
Right.

33:46.093 --> 33:48.302
Everyone else gets to leave,
and I get left behind.

33:49.130 --> 33:50.752
What's going on, D?

33:50.890 --> 33:52.099
Why'd you call the old number?

33:56.586 --> 33:58.036
My dad's getting out tomorrow,

33:58.174 --> 33:59.934
and last night,
I heard my uncle

34:00.072 --> 34:01.418
talking about taking him out

34:01.556 --> 34:03.455
<i>so he doesn't have to
hand back the crown.</i>

34:05.043 --> 34:06.044
Hey, it's Bradford.

34:06.182 --> 34:07.493
- What's up?
<i>- We found the kid.</i>

34:07.631 --> 34:09.530
She says Ed Teska ordered
a hit on his brother.

34:09.668 --> 34:10.876
I'll alert the prison,

34:11.014 --> 34:13.016
get him put in solitary
until he's released.

34:13.154 --> 34:14.776
Hey, four shooters just
showed up at the motel.

34:14.914 --> 34:16.330
I need backup, code 3.

34:19.712 --> 34:20.851
- Hey, what's up?
- Four shooters just landed.

34:20.989 --> 34:21.852
You got less than a minute.

34:21.990 --> 34:22.991
<i>Two are going in the front,</i>

34:23.130 --> 34:23.992
<i>two are going around back.</i>

34:24.131 --> 34:24.993
They're here.

34:25.132 --> 34:26.167
- Who?
- How many?

34:26.305 --> 34:27.479
Four.
Tim says we've got 60 seconds.

34:27.617 --> 34:28.928
Who's Tim?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.723
Is there a back window,
someplace you can escape to?

34:30.861 --> 34:32.553
There's a balcony,
but we're on the second floor.

34:32.691 --> 34:33.795
What the hell is going on?

34:33.933 --> 34:35.107
Who are you talking to?

34:35.245 --> 34:36.626
Put me on speaker. Look.

34:36.764 --> 34:38.006
<i>If you get caught up in there,
it's a fatal funnel.</i>

34:38.145 --> 34:39.732
<i>What else you got?</i>
- I say we take the hallway.

34:39.870 --> 34:40.975
Do a feigned retreat
to the south.

34:41.113 --> 34:42.770
Dynamic entry
on opposing adjacent rooms.

34:42.908 --> 34:44.082
Take long angles.

34:44.220 --> 34:46.049
Wedge out and post up
until backup arrives.

34:46.187 --> 34:47.223
But I'm gonna need a weapon.

34:47.361 --> 34:48.741
<i>That's not bad. Lucy?</i>

34:48.879 --> 34:49.846
Yeah, I can do that.

34:49.984 --> 34:50.847
How long until backup arrives?

34:50.985 --> 34:51.848
<i>Backup's en route.</i>

34:51.986 --> 34:53.056
What the hell is going on?

34:53.194 --> 34:54.368
Who the hell are you
with this--

34:54.506 --> 34:56.508
this "hallway, wedge, post"
crap?

34:56.646 --> 34:57.681
We're cops.

34:57.819 --> 34:59.787
I'm retired.
She's active current.

34:59.925 --> 35:00.926
You were undercover?

35:01.064 --> 35:02.307
I know it's a lot, but I--

35:02.445 --> 35:03.998
You're the reason
my dad was sent to prison!

35:04.136 --> 35:05.620
You lied to me!
- Dara, please.

35:05.758 --> 35:07.519
I can explain, but right now,
we need to focus on getting--

35:07.657 --> 35:08.692
Hey!

35:11.799 --> 35:13.387
Get back!

35:29.506 --> 35:30.542
Get back here!

35:47.938 --> 35:49.147
Hold still!

35:49.285 --> 35:50.562
It's okay, all right?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.080
We got you. You're safe now.

35:52.219 --> 35:53.565
All right? It's okay.

35:55.843 --> 35:58.086
Hey, I thought you weren't
leaving till tomorrow.

35:58.225 --> 35:59.191
I changed my flight.

35:59.329 --> 36:00.434
A car will be here any moment.

36:00.572 --> 36:02.056
Oh. Car? I can just take you.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.747
That's not necessary.

36:04.610 --> 36:06.267
Is something wrong?

36:06.405 --> 36:07.751
I have something
I need to talk to you about,

36:07.889 --> 36:09.926
but I just don't know how.

36:10.064 --> 36:11.169
How long
have we been friends?

36:11.307 --> 36:13.412
You can say
whatever you want to me.

36:14.033 --> 36:15.759
I think you might have
a drinking problem.

36:17.658 --> 36:20.178
<i>I</i> might have
a drinking problem?

36:20.316 --> 36:22.007
Listen, I've done my best

36:22.145 --> 36:23.802
to keep up
on these yearly visits,

36:23.940 --> 36:25.976
but I'm a mom of two now,

36:26.114 --> 36:28.116
and I just don't
have it in me anymore.

36:28.255 --> 36:29.704
I don't know how you manage

36:29.842 --> 36:33.536
with all of your jobs
and hobbies,

36:33.674 --> 36:35.469
but I'm afraid
you might be an alcoholic.

36:36.884 --> 36:38.265
Oh, that's my ride.

36:38.403 --> 36:39.611
I hope you're not mad,

36:39.749 --> 36:41.854
and I hope that you take
what I said to heart.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.306
Oh, I heard every word.

36:45.444 --> 36:48.378
Why don't we take next year off
and just give me a little time

36:48.516 --> 36:50.242
to get my life together
and things?

36:50.380 --> 36:51.485
I'm proud of you.

36:51.623 --> 36:53.141
Yeah.

37:16.061 --> 37:17.304
Oh, guys.

37:17.442 --> 37:18.650
That was so much fun.

37:18.788 --> 37:21.894
Not by my definition,
but you do you.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.276
No, actually--yeah.

37:24.414 --> 37:25.691
Stop--stop doing you.

37:25.829 --> 37:28.038
And stop accepting jobs
that break the law

37:28.176 --> 37:30.317
or put you in danger, please,
for all of our sakes.

37:30.455 --> 37:32.077
I will... as soon as I help

37:32.215 --> 37:34.321
this mysterious
and glamorous widow discover

37:34.459 --> 37:36.495
who dumped her husband's body
in the reservoir.

37:36.633 --> 37:38.566
Wow, I joshed you good.

37:38.704 --> 37:40.672
That's the plot to "Chinatown,"
a classic film.

37:40.810 --> 37:42.052
Want to come over tonight
and watch it?

37:42.190 --> 37:43.053
- No.
- I have plans.

37:43.191 --> 37:44.365
Okay, rain check it is.

37:44.503 --> 37:45.366
Get better soon.

37:45.504 --> 37:47.195
I will do. Bye!

37:48.714 --> 37:50.992
Hey, Sarge. Need something?

37:51.130 --> 37:53.271
I'm here to escort you
to your car.

37:53.409 --> 37:55.203
Oh, I just have
some paperwork to finish.

37:55.342 --> 37:56.826
No, you're going home,

37:56.964 --> 37:58.414
and you're gonna stay home.

37:58.552 --> 38:00.692
I don't want
to see you back here

38:00.830 --> 38:03.488
until you've given birth
to this child.

38:03.626 --> 38:04.489
Understood?

38:04.627 --> 38:05.835
Yes, Sarge.

38:05.973 --> 38:07.112
Good.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.632

38:09.770 --> 38:12.117

38:12.255 --> 38:13.118

38:13.256 --> 38:14.913
Thank you.

38:16.363 --> 38:17.571

38:17.709 --> 38:20.781

38:20.919 --> 38:23.024

five minutes away.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.716

38:27.546 --> 38:30.169

38:30.308 --> 38:31.619
You know,
when you go undercover,

38:31.757 --> 38:34.829
people always warn you
about the fear, the danger,

38:34.967 --> 38:37.522
but no one ever talks about
how hard it is

38:37.660 --> 38:38.799
when you have to leave
someone behind.

38:38.937 --> 38:39.903
And it's not like
you could come home

38:40.041 --> 38:41.146
and talk to me about it.

38:41.284 --> 38:42.596
This girl was clearly
important to you,

38:42.734 --> 38:45.046
and I'd never heard her name
until this morning.

38:45.184 --> 38:46.531
Patrol just found Ed Teska

38:46.669 --> 38:48.498
murdered in an alley
in Koreatown.

38:48.636 --> 38:49.603
Made a run at the king.

38:49.741 --> 38:51.605
And his daughter, and missed.

38:51.743 --> 38:53.607
That gets you killed
ten times out of ten.

38:55.056 --> 38:55.919
Want me to tell her?

38:56.057 --> 38:58.232
No. I got it.

39:08.173 --> 39:10.520
I don't even know
your real name.

39:10.658 --> 39:12.488
It's Isabel.

39:12.626 --> 39:14.455
I know you're going through
a lot right now,

39:14.593 --> 39:17.044
but it is vital

39:17.182 --> 39:19.667
that you don't tell anyone
I was a cop.

39:19.805 --> 39:21.289
It would endanger not only me,

39:21.428 --> 39:23.913
but everyone who helped me,

39:24.051 --> 39:25.501
whether they knew
who I was or not.

39:25.639 --> 39:29.884
Meaning I'd put myself
in danger too.

39:30.022 --> 39:31.127
Tell me the truth.

39:31.265 --> 39:33.992
Was I just a way
for you to get to my dad?

39:34.130 --> 39:36.995
At first, maybe,

39:37.133 --> 39:38.479
but you needed someone.

39:38.617 --> 39:41.586
Your dad barely remembered
to feed you.

39:41.724 --> 39:44.382
And I saw how alone you were

39:44.520 --> 39:49.525
at a moment
where I felt alone myself.

39:49.663 --> 39:51.423
So I looked out for you

39:51.561 --> 39:54.495
and took care of myself
in the process.

39:57.153 --> 39:59.258
