- No. Nothing changed.

wanted me to find a new place.

I will talk to Dr. Bill and
I'll tell you what he says, OK?

working out at Brian's,

stay at my place.

11:36.709 --> 11:39.583
I wouldn't want to
put you out.

you moved out it meant that,

23:51.417 --> 23:53.583
No feelings,
no-strings-attached sex?

23:53.667 --> 23:57.000
- There's no such thing.
- Brian? Who are you talking to?

23:58.041 --> 24:01.083
Dave. Just Dave.
You remember Dave.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.208
- Hi, Car... Karen.
- Yeah. Hi, Dave.

24:05.625 --> 24:09.792
[sniffles]
I'm sorry, I just...

24:09.875 --> 24:13.709
I just talked to Tony
and he's kind of crushed.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.959
Tony?
Your boyfriend Tony?

24:16.041 --> 24:19.417
- My ex-boyfriend Tony.
- Your ex-boyfriend Tony?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.166
Wow.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.667
I told him it was over.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.333
Can I get a hug?

24:31.208 --> 24:32.750
Yeah.

24:34.875 --> 24:38.166
- [phone beeping]
- [Karen moans]

24:40.875 --> 24:43.750
Ivy. Dave. We got a winner.

24:48.333 --> 24:49.375
You can go in now.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.458
[sighs]

24:54.500 --> 24:56.417
Hi. It's been a long time.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.583
- You got married again?
- Two years ago.

24:58.667 --> 25:01.542
- Wow, two years.
- Yeah.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.166
Well, come on, sit down.
I'm glad you called.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.458
Charisse says you
have a proposal for me.

25:06.542 --> 25:09.125
- I'm here about Zap Monkey.
- Zap Monkey?

25:09.208 --> 25:13.000
Leviathan bought this game
we created, but because
of political crap,

25:13.083 --> 25:14.458
they're gonna sit on it.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.917
We can buy it back for $75,000
and shop it around.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
So we're meeting
with potential investors.

25:20.083 --> 25:24.458
I have a portfolio,
it's all here.

25:24.542 --> 25:26.500
It tested well
in the major markets.

25:26.583 --> 25:29.291
Flip to the back page,
you'll see some projections.

25:29.375 --> 25:33.208
I'm not interested in
projections, I'm interested
in why you came to me.

25:35.667 --> 25:39.834
I'm here because
Dave and I need an investor.

25:39.917 --> 25:42.792
And I know you never
say "no" to a good investment.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.625
Hmm.

25:44.709 --> 25:49.542
Let's be honest. You're
desperate. You and I both know

25:49.625 --> 25:52.041
you wouldn't come to me
if you had any other options.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.750
Look, if you're
not interested, it's fine.

25:55.750 --> 25:59.333
I never see you, Brian.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.875
Never hear from you.

26:00.959 --> 26:03.542
I have to get updates on you
from your sister.

26:03.625 --> 26:08.458
And then you walk in here and
you want me to give you $75,000?

26:08.542 --> 26:10.667
You could call me.
You could get my number.

26:10.750 --> 26:14.458
Why? So you can
not call me back?

26:14.542 --> 26:17.500
Look, I've never
asked you for anything.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.583
Not money for a car, apartment
or to pay my college loans.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.000
If you could just try
and get over the past,

26:23.083 --> 26:25.625
we could have an
actual relationship.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.625
That's a lot to get over.
Just ask Mom.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.667
OK, Brian. You want my help?

26:37.750 --> 26:40.333
I'll give you the same offer
when you graduated,

26:40.417 --> 26:43.667
the same offer I gave you
when you came out to LA.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.917
Come to work for me. Here.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.291
I have a job.
That's not what I'm asking for.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.083
[chuckles]

26:51.166 --> 26:53.542
You're exactly the same
as when you were a kid.

26:53.625 --> 26:56.667
How would you know
what I was like as a kid?

26:56.750 --> 26:59.500
Don't play the guilt card on me,

26:59.583 --> 27:01.792
you've tried that for years,
it doesn't work.

27:08.834 --> 27:13.583
- Then I guess we're done here.
- Let me tell you something.

27:13.667 --> 27:17.750
When I started this company,
I used every penny I had.

27:17.834 --> 27:20.834
I took out loans, and I
maxed out all my credit cards.

27:20.917 --> 27:22.583
If you don't have the guts

27:22.667 --> 27:24.667
to do everything it takes
for your company,

27:24.750 --> 27:27.041
why should I?

27:28.375 --> 27:33.041
Now I've made you an offer.
It's up to you to accept it.

27:35.375 --> 27:39.709
- I don't want to work for you.
- Then you're right. We're done.

27:43.041 --> 27:45.750
And soon, Goldie will be
flushed to a better place,

27:45.834 --> 27:49.792
where she will see all the
other goldfish in the sea,

27:49.875 --> 27:53.750
- and she will swim...
- Happily ever after.

27:53.834 --> 27:55.417
Three magic sprinkles.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.291
One, two, three.

27:58.375 --> 28:01.041
Prepare to flush.

28:01.125 --> 28:05.375
We need Mommy here, too. Come
on, Mommy, I want you to come.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.417
Now we all hold hands.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.917
- We all hold hands.
- OK.

28:12.959 --> 28:16.917
[girls] Bye, Goldie!
We love you!

28:19.208 --> 28:22.792
Thanks for calling me.
It means a lot.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.959
I did it for the girls.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.500
[woman] Next customer, please.

28:36.166 --> 28:38.041
[phone rings]

28:41.583 --> 28:44.041
- What up?
- Did you get the money or what?

28:47.375 --> 28:49.208
Sorry. Yeah, yeah.
I got it.

28:49.291 --> 28:51.917
It's all good.
Let me call you back.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.500
Between your savings and
checking accounts,

28:54.583 --> 28:56.750
you have a total of $3,700.

28:58.792 --> 29:02.917
OK. What if I wanted to get a
cash advance on my credit card?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.291
Is that possible?

29:04.375 --> 29:07.750
It is. You have a limit
of $15,000 on each.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.625
Can I cash out my CDs, my IRA?

29:09.709 --> 29:12.375
Sir, there is a substantial
penalty for both.

29:12.458 --> 29:15.625
Yeah, I know, I know.

29:15.709 --> 29:17.291
I just really need the money.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.417
[inhales deeply, exhales]

29:23.500 --> 29:25.375
Do it all.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.166
It isn't tacky, is it?

29:35.250 --> 29:37.750
These were for
Adam and Marjorie's wedding.

29:37.834 --> 29:42.166
What you call tacky, I call
recycled. Al Gore would approve.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.750
It isn't a stripper, is it?

29:44.834 --> 29:46.583
- What?
- The surprise.

29:46.667 --> 29:51.208
Whole bunch of people RSVP'd
from work, I wanna make sure.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.417
Nicole, I'm not an idiot, OK?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.709
I have planned one or two
of these things before.

29:56.792 --> 29:59.583
Besides, I know Angelo's
not gonna want to come home

29:59.667 --> 30:01.500
to some guy in a leopard...

30:05.125 --> 30:09.417
Angelo? Angelo's coming home?

30:09.500 --> 30:11.542
No, he's not.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.000
Is that the surprise?
When is he coming?

30:14.083 --> 30:17.500
I did not say that he...

30:17.583 --> 30:19.583
- He'll be here tonight.
- [giggles]

30:19.667 --> 30:22.875
Brian is picking him up from LAX
halfway through the shower.

30:22.959 --> 30:25.000
Oh, God. I'm finally
gonna see my husband.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.917
What am I gonna wear?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.917
Everyone is going to kill me.
[laughs, sighs]

30:32.000 --> 30:34.458
I just wasn't thinking.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.542
All this stuff
with Dave just...

30:38.291 --> 30:40.125
Dave? I thought...

30:41.542 --> 30:44.250
I thought everything
was going well.

30:44.333 --> 30:48.291
It went beyond well, which just
made everything even harder.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.542
I mean, we're a family,
you know?

30:50.625 --> 30:54.458
We were supposed to be working
on our marriage and Dave...

30:54.542 --> 30:57.792
Well, he just went out
and he ruined everything.

30:57.875 --> 31:00.208
[scoffs]

31:01.875 --> 31:04.458
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

31:04.542 --> 31:06.417
Never mind,
it's none of my business.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.959
Oh, just say it.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.625
Dave didn't ruin
anything, honey.

31:11.709 --> 31:15.417
You're the one that told him
to go and be with another woman.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.917
I know it's not
what you want to hear.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.125
You can't blame Dave for this.

31:22.208 --> 31:26.542
The situation you're in,
you caused this.

31:28.750 --> 31:30.667
- I need to go.
- Oh, Deen, Deen...

31:30.750 --> 31:32.583
No, no, really, it's fine.
I just...

31:32.667 --> 31:34.917
I'll see you tonight.
I just need to go.

- Hi.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.709
What're you doing here?

32:15.792 --> 32:18.917
Business affairs call you in
for a meeting or something?

32:19.000 --> 32:22.625
No, we bought Vision State back.
Brian and I did.

32:22.709 --> 32:26.333
- What?
- We're gonna
put it back on the market.

32:27.625 --> 32:29.667
- I guess that's it, then.
- No, Dave...

32:29.750 --> 32:32.208
No, you said you were
gonna fight for us,

32:32.291 --> 32:34.250
then dumped
the game on purpose.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.625
After you dump me,
I'm supposed to fight for you,

32:36.709 --> 32:41.208
- jeopardize my job for you?
- I didn't dump you, OK?

32:41.291 --> 32:44.083
We both knew what was
going on from the start.

32:44.166 --> 32:45.667
You can't deny
you had feelings.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.250
No. No, I didn't.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.000
I didn't have feelings for you.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.583
It was just about sex.
That's it. You knew that.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.333
Did you think I was
going to leave my wife for you?

32:57.125 --> 32:59.375
Get away from me.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.750
If you want a lap dance,
ask somebody else.

33:15.834 --> 33:20.125
I don't want anything. I want
to apologize for being an ass.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.000
This wedding thing
screwed me up.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.709
Not that that's
an excuse or anything.

33:26.458 --> 33:27.709
For what it's worth I think

33:27.792 --> 33:31.792
you're gonna make a great
sort-of doctor someday.

33:31.875 --> 33:35.000
Thanks.
And thanks for coming by.

33:35.083 --> 33:38.083
Most guys who treat you like
crap don't apologize for it.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.959
Well, I'm trying
not to be most guys.

33:41.041 --> 33:43.417
I'll see you around, Summer.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.667
It's "Heather."

33:47.542 --> 33:49.041
My real name. It's Heather.

33:50.792 --> 33:53.375
So you never went, right?
To that Cuban place?

33:55.917 --> 33:58.000
Because, maybe sometime,
we could go.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.291
Yeah, that'd be great.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.458
OK, so I'm updating my profile.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.291
Which picture of us
do you like better?

34:07.917 --> 34:10.250
- Babe!
- [groans] Oh, God.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.959
I know it's not
your best angle.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.792
- Did you leave the computer on?
- [Dave] No. Why?

34:25.875 --> 34:29.166
You're signed on
to the server.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.458
Probably a glitch.

34:30.542 --> 34:32.166
No, you're
downloading something.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.417
Wait! I'm in
the middle of something!

34:36.583 --> 34:38.500
Let me see.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.959
Yeah, I am logged in.
It's the game.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.834
- Someone's grabbing it.
- Logged in as you?

34:46.917 --> 34:48.125
Someone is
logged in as me.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.959
And they're downloading
it somewhere.

34:51.041 --> 34:53.625
Where?
What's the IP address?

34:55.709 --> 34:57.667
I can't tell!
It's encrypted.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.500
Do something!
We have to do something!

34:59.583 --> 35:02.250
- OK, I'm trying.
- And who would do this to us?

35:02.333 --> 35:04.959
You can't even access it
without the password!

35:06.125 --> 35:09.000
Suzanne. I gave Suzanne
the password.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.542
See where it went.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.834
[Dave] Oh, my God.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.500
It uploaded to a
free gaming site.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.125
- People are downloading it!
- Is that bad?

35:30.208 --> 35:32.959
If everyone gets it for free,
no one's gonna buy it!

35:33.041 --> 35:35.917
Worse than that, it's the
prototype. It's all the code.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.917
Anyone can access it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.375
Millions of dollars,
all of our work, it's gone!

35:46.709 --> 35:51.000
I'm just gonna be in the other
room finishing my profile.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.750
I don't get it.
Who would do this to us?

35:55.834 --> 35:58.583
- I told you. Suzanne.
- That doesn't make any sense.

35:58.667 --> 36:01.917
They decided not to push
the game. What does she care?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.709
Because I slept with her.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.375
- What?
- Yeah, during
the open marriage.

36:09.291 --> 36:12.834
And then after. Recently.

36:12.917 --> 36:16.625
Wait, you and Suzanne
were sleeping together?

36:16.709 --> 36:19.208
Deena found out.
Kicked me out of the house.

36:19.291 --> 36:22.291
- That's why I'm here.
- Hold on, hold on.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.834
If you're sleeping
with Suzanne...

36:24.917 --> 36:26.500
I was sleeping
with Suzanne.

36:26.583 --> 36:30.041
I ended things
a couple days ago.

36:33.166 --> 36:37.667
How could you keep this from me?
I tell you everything.

36:37.750 --> 36:39.291
About my feelings
for Marjorie,

36:39.375 --> 36:41.291
about the night
before the wedding.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.709
I know. OK, I screwed up.

36:44.792 --> 36:47.792
You're having an affair
with the one person

36:47.875 --> 36:51.750
that holds the fate of our
company in her hands, Dave.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.709
I did everything
to get us that money.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.834
I'm gonna talk to your dad,
pay him back.

36:55.917 --> 37:00.125
It was my money, Dave! OK?
It was not my dad's.

37:00.208 --> 37:03.875
It was every penny I had, and
then some, and then some more.

37:03.959 --> 37:06.250
And now it's gone!
All of it!

37:09.959 --> 37:11.750
[sighs]

37:14.208 --> 37:15.583
[door slams]

37:17.417 --> 37:19.000
[indistinct chatter]

37:19.083 --> 37:20.834
[group] Ahh!

37:27.375 --> 37:29.750
Hey, man. Got bad news.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.375
- The shower's only half over?
- Worse.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.041
The DA isn't dropping
the charges.

37:35.125 --> 37:38.208
- You gotta go to court.
- Great.

37:38.291 --> 37:41.583
[Nicole] It's a monitor
so I can spy on my child.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.166
[Deena] How are you?

37:47.291 --> 37:50.125
I really need to
tell you something.

37:50.959 --> 37:52.458
I don't want to do this now.

37:58.250 --> 38:01.625
- I wish it wasn't like this.
- Me, too.

38:04.667 --> 38:09.083
I don't know what I wanted,
with the open marriage.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.834
I thought we could pretend
we were young.

38:14.208 --> 38:18.583
Maybe I just wanted to be a kid
again, because I felt so...

38:18.667 --> 38:21.667
...old and boring.

38:24.458 --> 38:27.875
Sometimes you start something
with the best of intentions,

38:27.959 --> 38:31.500
and you actually believe that
you are doing the right thing,

38:31.583 --> 38:35.667
and you never could imagine that
it would become what it becomes.

38:35.750 --> 38:38.917
That it would just spiral
into something so horrible

38:39.000 --> 38:41.917
and irreversible and damaging,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.834
and you just can't go back
and make it right.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.166
Does any of this
make any sense to you?

38:50.542 --> 38:54.709
I have been blaming you
for Suzanne, for everything.

38:54.792 --> 38:59.250
But I'm the one who destroyed
this marriage. I did.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.542
I can't do this anymore.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.959
We lost the company today.

39:13.041 --> 39:15.792
Zap Monkey... is dead.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.208
- What?
- I called things off
with Suzanne.

39:18.291 --> 39:20.208
I never wanted
to sleep with her.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.959
I only did it 'cause
of you and Richard.

39:23.041 --> 39:25.500
So we'd be even, you
wouldn't be cheating on me.

39:25.583 --> 39:28.041
So I wouldn't feel like
more of a loser

39:28.125 --> 39:29.583
than you already
made me feel,

39:29.667 --> 39:33.041
and I guess me breaking up
with her pissed her off,

39:33.125 --> 39:35.417
and she killed the game.

39:35.500 --> 39:40.041
Everything we did, everything we
worked on, everything we built

39:40.125 --> 39:43.333
is down the drain.
And you know what?

39:43.417 --> 39:49.417
I really don't know whose fault
it is, and I don't care.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.250
We're out of options.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.875
So you think it's... over?

39:57.959 --> 40:02.041
Yeah. It's over.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.583
Dave and Suzanne.
I mean, what was he thinking?

40:09.667 --> 40:11.834
The game was on the line,
and all those months...

40:11.917 --> 40:14.208
I mean, Dave and Suzanne?

40:14.291 --> 40:16.792
I think we should do
something fun this weekend.

40:18.959 --> 40:22.417
Karen, I just lost all my money.
I can't afford fun.

40:24.166 --> 40:27.834
You know what, Brian?
You don't seem very into me.

40:27.917 --> 40:29.625
- [phone rings]
- [sighs]

40:31.083 --> 40:34.125
We're five minutes from LAX.
What terminal, again?

40:36.083 --> 40:39.542
I'm sorry. Who?

40:39.625 --> 40:43.125
Yes, Brian Davis.
I'm his brother-in-law.

40:44.917 --> 40:46.959
Pull over,
pull over. Pull over!

40:47.041 --> 40:48.458
Why?

40:58.333 --> 41:01.000
What's going on?

41:04.750 --> 41:07.417
That was the police calling
from Angelo's phone.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.375
There's been
some sort of car accident.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.041
Is he OK?

41:20.417 --> 41:23.291
He's dead.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.667
- You look really beautiful.
- Thanks.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.500
I bought it, I just bought...

41:29.583 --> 41:31.792
What's Ang going to think
when he sees me?

41:31.875 --> 41:35.166
I think he's going to wonder
how he stayed away so long.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.417
- Thanks, Deen.
- One person is
going to grab a balloon,

41:38.500 --> 41:41.917
you're gonna go outside, stand
on opposite sides of the pool,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.208
and one person is gonna
throw the balloon over...

41:45.291 --> 41:47.333
Hey! Surprise!
