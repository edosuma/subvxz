00:28.028 --> 00:29.439
You lied to me.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.649
Someone used my
proprietary code

00:34.743 --> 00:38.452
to access the file identifying the
Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.247
The file was accessed
from Nilaa's computer.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.285
She may be facilitating a terrorist
attack on domestic soil.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.666
My guy was able to
hack the ATM camera.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.210
Changed the time stamp.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.713
Rebecca's already
pulled the footage.

00:52.803 --> 00:55.886
CTU won't be able to trace
the leak back to you.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.805
You said you were out
running that morning,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.552
but here you are,
entering the office.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.101
You need to come clean. Tell
me who you're working with.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.554
Isaac's girlfriend,
she's up to something.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.481

or some kind of recording.</i>

back from this meeting,</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:15.780
<i>wouldn't be a lot of tears.</i>

<i>AISHA: I don't like the way
she been looking at me.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:18.867
<i>Maybe she knows something.</i>

01:18.996 --> 01:20.282
You want me to
do her right now?

01:20.372 --> 01:23.330
Not until Royo calls and we
know Isaac's taken care of.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.330
You need to finish
mixing that explosive.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.205

activated at any time.

of those Rangers.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.153

out there jogging

at the exact place,

were stolen.

think I'm part of this?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.481
If you were in my shoes,
what would you think?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.309
Rebecca has told me
these terrorists

02:33.403 --> 02:34.734

kill thousands of people.

stop this

02:40.369 --> 02:41.655
and I will do
everything I can...

02:41.745 --> 02:43.031
Just leave me alone.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.117
Please just go.
Talk to me.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.291

03:02.432 --> 03:03.422

03:03.809 --> 03:04.890
What happened?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.011
<i>They must have
been tracking Grimes,</i>

03:06.103 --> 03:07.093
took the flash drive

03:07.187 --> 03:08.177
before he had
a chance to move in.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.262
They're locking down the area
but it doesn't look good.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.813
What about Carter,
is he all right?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.023
Carter is fine

03:13.110 --> 03:14.191
but he identified
one of the terrorists

03:14.277 --> 03:15.733
as Jadalla Bin-Khalid.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.193
JadaHa?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.362
He had a falling out
with his father,

03:19.449 --> 03:20.735
left his study at Oxford.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.024
Yeah, well,

03:22.119 --> 03:23.530
guess his father's death
gave him a change of heart.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.406
Hey, did you get anywhere
with Nilaa Mizrani?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.283
Not yet. My husband
is speaking with her.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.578
I thought a personal appeal
might get her to open up.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.705
Well, right now she's our
best hope to stop Jadalla

03:31.795 --> 03:33.331
from activating
those sleeper cells.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.374
I want her back at CTU,
we'll work on her there.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.671
Okay, on my way.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.040

03:43.098 --> 03:44.509
You're coming
with us to CTU.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.428
On the way
think about this...

03:51.690 --> 03:52.771
You're facing
the death penalty

03:52.858 --> 03:54.223
for the murders
of those Rangers.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.058
If you want to prevent that,
you better speak up

03:56.236 --> 03:57.943
before any more Americans
lose their lives.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.733
Get her to the car.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.695
She's terrified.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.368
Good, I wasn't bluffing.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.908
I mean, it really seems like
she doesn't know anything.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.247
Come on, John.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.325
It's not impossible that
she's being set up, Rebecca.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.669
What if she's
telling the truth?

04:17.923 --> 04:18.959
You're a good man.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.550
It's why you only want
to see the good in people,

04:21.678 --> 04:24.010

it just isn't there.

some ATM security video

04:53.710 --> 04:55.792

at the campaign headquarters

04:55.879 --> 04:57.916

the Rangers' identities

04:58.006 --> 04:59.371
were being stolen.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.795
They're taking her
over to CTU.

accepting this.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.022
Yeah, but you just said

05:25.116 --> 05:27.232
that they found

05:27.327 --> 05:28.658

that Nilaa is not

the sooner you can

05:41.466 --> 05:45.004

from the damage she's done.

surprised by all this?

Well... I mean, you know
her <i>as</i> well as I do.

we keep all to ourselves.

to keep that in mind

06:18.795 --> 06:21.787

But right now I'm just focused on

when I first got here,

18:28.733 --> 18:30.770

every time you screwed up

Director, the initial raid
against Bin-Khalid

18:45.082 --> 18:46.288
was prompted by reports

that he was planning
multiple attacks

18:47.877 --> 18:49.242
against the United States.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.452
We thought we'd taken him out

18:50.546 --> 18:52.287
before he was able to
put that network in place.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.873

18:54.967 --> 18:56.128
<i>how long
before they strike?</i>

18:56.218 --> 18:57.959
We have to assume
the cells are ready to go.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.340
Attacks may
already be underway.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.096
I'll let Rebecca respond.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.226
Bin-Khalid's goal was to implant
a network of sleeper cells

19:10.358 --> 19:12.941
consisting of home-grown
sympathizers and foreign operatives

19:13.027 --> 19:14.813
entering the country
under false identities.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.610
Fifteen to 20 cells,

19:16.697 --> 19:18.233
each with a specific target.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.449
And likely coordinated
to take place simultaneously.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.443
If a series of attacks
like these were launched,

19:23.579 --> 19:25.365
the effect could
be devastating.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.247
The kind of apocalypse
Bin-Khalid promised.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.431
Can we have a minute?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.397
He's not going anywhere.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.949
All right.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.450
What did you mean
you can fix this?

20:10.292 --> 20:11.453
Did you see the guns?

20:11.794 --> 20:13.660
Bin-Khalid's people
were using the semis.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.791
Yeah, A-120s.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.464
They were modified A-120s.
The custom slide.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.631
As far as I know, there's
only one man who sells those.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.546
You ever heard of
an arms smuggler,

20:24.640 --> 20:26.096
goes by the name Gabriel?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.674
He's ex-military.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.557
He went into business for himself
when Stockwood went under.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.637
He's a ghost.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.307
Gabriel smuggles
arms and people.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.233
I think that if Bin-Khalid's men
got those guns from Gabriel,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.277
there's a good chance,
Eric...

20:41.031 --> 20:43.773
There's a good chance that
he got them in the country.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.532
(SCOFFS)

20:47.246 --> 20:50.238
But, Eric, if Gabriel's still
based out of the same place,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.073
I can get us to him,

20:52.168 --> 20:54.000

Bin-Khalid's people are,

20:54.086 --> 20:55.668
what identities
they're using.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.705
What?
What do you think?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.092
I'm asking myself
if any of this is real.

to do that, Ben.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.078
protesting the speech,
just like she claimed.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.328
You are certain about this?

25:03.585 --> 25:06.247
There's footage of her. She's
trying to shout the Imam down

25:06.338 --> 25:07.828
saying that he's
perverting her religion,

25:07.923 --> 25:09.709
that Islam teaches peace.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.801
Show me what you got.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.046
<i>It has descended
upon us word for word</i>

25:17.141 --> 25:18.757
<i>from Allah...
We don't live</i>

25:18.851 --> 25:20.512
<i>in the 7th century.</i>

25:20.602 --> 25:22.764
<i>Islam is not about hate,
it's about peace.</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:24.644
<i>IMAM: Fight the unbelievers.</i>

25:24.940 --> 25:25.930
<i>Fight them! Do not
accept them</i>

25:26.025 --> 25:27.811
<i>as your friends
and your allies.</i>

25:27.943 --> 25:30.310
NILAA: <i>But the Prophet Muhammad
had Christians and Jews</i>

25:30.404 --> 25:31.644
<i>as his allies.</i>

25:32.031 --> 25:33.362
Ben and I will
go in together.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.447
If we make contact
with Gabriel

25:35.743 --> 25:37.780
we'll see if he knows how
to find Jadalla Bin-Khalid.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.111
REBECCA: Why limit the
operation to you and Grimes?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.570
If he really knows
Gabriel's location

25:41.665 --> 25:44.032
why not go in hard,
send an attack team.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.868
Because if Gabriel is not on
site then we've shown our hand.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.749
We'll never find him.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.126
On what pretext would you and
Grimes make this approach?

25:52.801 --> 25:55.042
According to Ben,

25:55.137 --> 25:56.127
Gabriel won't show himself

25:56.221 --> 25:58.553
unless we have
something that he wants.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.675
Bait.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.468
Ben said the schematics for many
of the current anti-missile

26:03.562 --> 26:04.973
defense systems
would do it.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.470
The ONIX or the T7.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.480
That Grimes would
offer to sell to Gabriel.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.640
(SCOFFS)

26:09.818 --> 26:11.400
Well, suddenly
this all makes sense.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.768
What's your point, Mullins?

26:12.863 --> 26:15.855
Eric, your friend is asking for
highly classified weapons schematics

26:15.991 --> 26:18.574
that he can sell for millions of dollars.
With all due respect,

26:19.203 --> 26:20.489
doesn't this sound familiar?

26:22.206 --> 26:23.196
Rebecca,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.707
I looked Ben in the eye

26:28.337 --> 26:32.501
and I honestly believe that he
is trying to redeem himself,

26:32.674 --> 26:33.914
that he is
telling me the truth.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.499
KEITH: How sure of that
can you be?

26:40.349 --> 26:43.216
I can't. Okay,
not completely,

26:43.310 --> 26:45.847
but right now this is the
only play that we have

26:46.021 --> 26:48.729
unless someone else can tell me
that you have any other leads.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.770
Well, we just got
the all agency report.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.067
No one has anything
actionable across the board.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.067
So, maybe this
is worth trying.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.989
KEITH: Fortunately,
it's not your call, Andy.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.692
We'll double check
the intel on Gabriel,

27:00.828 --> 27:02.694
analyze digital forensics
on arms transactions...

27:02.830 --> 27:05.367
No, all of your technology
didn't save my Ranger squad.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.541
We have a location on
Gabriel and a way in.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.618
We don't need

27:10.712 --> 27:11.702
another one of your
analysis, Mullins.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.329
We need boots
on the ground.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.755
Carter, you're an Army Ranger,
you're not a CTU agent

27:15.884 --> 27:18.467
and you're not in the middle of
the desert operating on your own.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.919
We don't just go
on our gut here,

27:20.013 --> 27:21.720
we make decisions
based on intel

27:21.849 --> 27:24.307
and I cannot
authorize this mission.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.724
There are too many variables.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.469
I appreciate all you've
done for us today,

27:27.563 --> 27:29.804
but this my call. Agent Wilkes
will take you to debrief.

27:29.898 --> 27:30.933
Mullins.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.775
Eric.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.904
Are you hearing what you
want to hear from Grimes?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.577
Convincing yourself
you can trust him?

27:44.663 --> 27:45.698
Why would I do that?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.905
Because you blame yourself
for what happened today.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.581
Look, Rebecca...

27:54.798 --> 27:56.505
I told you and Mullins
what I think.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.005
And right now, I don't
see any other option.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.340
Do you?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.927
I can't get you
the ONIX schematics.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.514
Great.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.145
But I know someone who can.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.525
You'd have to
handle the rest yourself.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.146
Yeah, just send the
schematics to my phone

28:20.240 --> 28:22.106
and I'll move as
soon as I have them.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.609
Thank you.

this would end up in my lap.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.240
You surprise me, Andy.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.581
Mullins is looking for
any excuse to fire me.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.830
I might as well
give him a good one.

29:20.008 --> 29:20.998
How long do you need?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.667
It should take me ten minutes
to retrieve the schematics.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.969
Send them to Carter's
phone when you have them.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.473
You know, you're the only
person I would do this for.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.682
Remember that when I'm looking
for a job or facing jail time.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.099

All right?

Yes, yes.

There is.

take a look at

were stolen from

to just turn against Nilaa.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.334

how you could do something
that would be so horrible.

you need to tell me why.

cut a deal.

from terrorists then?

No, I didn't,

mattered to the public

still my responsibility.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.661

let you pay for it.

those Rangers' names.

Son, I made a choice.
I made a terrible,

terrible choice.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.721
I betrayed
American soldiers.

that your Presidency could do

could be lost

launches those attacks.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.366
Do you understand that?

38:10.830 --> 38:12.696
You need to tell Rebecca
everything you know.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.953
I don't know anything
that could help find those...

to contact them.

Listen, son, I don't expect you
to forgive what I've done.

But you have to understand
the consequences here.

you will be ruining yourself

38:42.320 --> 38:44.231
and I beg you please.
Dad.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.154
Don't throw away
everything

38:46.241 --> 38:48.653
that we have worked for
your whole life.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.655
I was just coming
to talk to you

38:51.746 --> 38:53.487
and your father
about campaign managers.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.616
You know anything, Tio?

38:55.416 --> 38:56.406
Anything about what?

38:56.543 --> 38:58.534
Because if you do, you
need to tell me right now.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.538
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.421
I'll let my father
tell you then.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.358
What the hell
did you do?

39:25.613 --> 39:26.603
(SIGHS)

39:30.034 --> 39:31.195
He already knew.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.206
I tried to talk him
through it,

39:38.293 --> 39:40.455
I tried to reason
with him but...

39:42.505 --> 39:44.212
He's going to CTU.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.299
(EXHALES)

39:49.095 --> 39:50.130
That's okay.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.424
We can still save this.
How?

39:52.515 --> 39:53.755
I've told him
everything.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.011
You'll deny it.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.226
Unless he was
wearing a wire,

39:58.313 --> 39:59.678
there is
no hard evidence

39:59.772 --> 40:01.809
linking you or me
to anything.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.234
And whatever they do at
CTU you hold your mud.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.232
And we'll
get through this.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.198
And so will John.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.744
I didn't do anything.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.118
<i>INTERROGATOR: If that were true,
you wouldn't be</i> here <i>with me.</i>

40:19.834 --> 40:21.416
<i>So stop wasting time
and tell me</i>

40:21.502 --> 40:23.834
<i>what you know about
Jadalla Bin-Khalid.</i>

40:25.715 --> 40:26.750
John.

40:27.634 --> 40:28.840
It wasn't Nilaa.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.547
She's innocent.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.345
<i>And I can prove it.</i>

40:38.853 --> 40:40.719
<i>REBECCA: Then who
leaked those names?</i>

40:55.203 --> 40:57.490
So you first noticed
Mr. Grimes becoming unstable

40:57.580 --> 41:00.117
one year before the mission
to eliminate Bin-Khalid?

41:01.125 --> 41:02.160
That's right.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.706
The war really
changed him, I just...

41:06.965 --> 41:08.581
Never realized how much.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.206
Did you report
your observations

41:10.301 --> 41:11.291
to your superiors
at the time?

41:11.386 --> 41:13.252
No. I didn't.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.590
Why?

41:15.765 --> 41:16.755
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

41:24.357 --> 41:26.564
Mr. Carter,
everything okay?

41:32.365 --> 41:34.606
Yeah, sorry.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.401
Yeah, everything is good.

41:37.537 --> 41:38.823
(GRUNTING)

41:41.124 --> 41:42.159
Don't make a sound.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.786
Turn over.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.748
Show me
your hands, now.

41:52.093 --> 41:55.211
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay.
I'm just gonna lock you down.

42:40.808 --> 42:41.843
Need to talk
to him again.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.967
Sir, I need to get authorization.
Already have it.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.804
We're crossing T's and dotting I's
on this, I'll have to call it in.

42:46.898 --> 42:47.888
I'm sorry.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.602
(GRUNTING)

42:54.155 --> 42:55.190
What are you doing?

42:55.698 --> 42:58.360
Exactly what we
talked about. Let's go.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.115
(ALARM BLARING)

43:02.663 --> 43:03.653
Hey-

43:03.790 --> 43:05.952
Security is reporting a
situation in the infirmary.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.077
Andy, pull it up.

43:07.168 --> 43:08.499
All right. There you go.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.922
Carter. Lock
everything down, now.

43:19.472 --> 43:20.507
What happened?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.464
Smoke alarm in the
server rooms went off.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.883
It triggers an automatic
system shutdown

43:24.977 --> 43:26.308
to protect the servers.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.635
KEITH: Get these
cameras back up.

43:27.730 --> 43:28.845
It will take
five minutes to reboot.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.517
Until then we're blind.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.848
Son of a bitch.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.693
(GRUNTS)

43:46.624 --> 43:47.705
(PANTING) Ben.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.083
You better be telling me
the truth about Gabriel.

43:51.921 --> 43:52.956
I am.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.459
Eric, I swear.

43:56.717 --> 44:01.302
Good, 'cause if you're not
I'm gonna kill you myself.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.672
