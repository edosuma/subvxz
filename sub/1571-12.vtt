Peter, what are you doing?

I'm watching this
awesome show, Brian.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.205
See, they took all these colors

Peter, for God's sake,

00:58.893 --> 01:00.726
did you eat this entire
roll of raw cookie dough?

01:00.728 --> 01:01.927
Oh, is that what that was?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.595
I thought it was
a raisin sausage.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.230
Peter, you're gonna get sick.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.499
You can't just eat raw food
out of the fridge.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.835
Eh, calm down,

01:09.837 --> 01:12.905

Okay, we'll go deeper.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.189
Yeah, I was swindled by that cat
who said he was from the future.

Oh, I understand.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.264
I understand I've made
hundreds of deadly enemies

04:25.266 --> 04:27.766

up at the jailhouse windows.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.101

Oh...

well, why is everybody here?

04:41.215 --> 04:43.448
Peter, your mother is dead.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.618

afternoon and she died.

I just, I just can't believe
she's really gone.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.675
And I can't believe this
funeral home has a skylight

05:43.677 --> 05:46.411

staring down at us.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.349
Thank you for coming, everyone.

05:50.351 --> 05:53.452
We're here to celebrate
the life of Thelma Griffin.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.922
Here to say a few words
about Thelma is her son, Peter.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.559
My mother always hoped
to be buried

06:00.561 --> 06:02.194
with her pet cat, Mittens,

06:02.196 --> 06:04.796
so I'd like to thank
the Quahog Veterinary Society

06:04.798 --> 06:06.698
for putting Mittens down
so quickly.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.534
Yeah, just-just go ahead
and toss it in there.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.870
P-Probably, probably just
stuff it in by the feet.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.641
Okay, I will now take
questions from the audience.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.544
No? None? They don't
have to be about my mom.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.247
Is anyone else here watching
<i>Revolution</i> and wanting

06:22.249 --> 06:24.082

06:24.084 --> 06:25.384
No! No! No! No!

06:25.386 --> 06:26.985
I'm not caught up!
I'm not caught up!

06:26.987 --> 06:30.422
Lotta white socks with
dress shoes in this bitch.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.723

06:31.725 --> 06:32.891
Yeah, they're stupid.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.559

06:34.561 --> 06:35.994
What do you mean?
Of course you are.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.329
I'm not gonna die, Brian.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.764
I'm like Jim Belushi.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.233

You are going

06:55.282 --> 06:58.417
Wow... I guess you learn
something new everyday.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.085
Like the Black Eyed Peas.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.753
Hey, what's that?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.355
This is a guitar.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.090
Wow...

07:09.762 --> 07:13.932
Oh, Peter, look,
your mom's old photo albums.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.468
Oh, look at your
little baby footprints.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.371
Yeah, my mom took my footprint
every single year.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.810
When I was eight,
I was a dragon.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.178
(knocking on door)

07:27.780 --> 07:30.148
Oh, hello.
You must be Cocoon.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.818
We don't have any rocks to make
you stronger here, but welcome.

07:32.820 --> 07:33.952
(laughing)

07:33.954 --> 07:35.287
You must be Peter.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.489
I'm Evelyn, a friend
of your mother's.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.890
Oh, oh, hi.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.891
This is my family.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.460
They're of no comfort.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.962
Oh... I know it's tough
what you're going through.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.899
You're where I was 17 years ago,
when I lost my husband, Walter.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.801
He died of pancreatic cancer.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.970
That sounds sad,
but I didn't know him.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.805
Man, I miss my mom so much.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.641
Well, I knew your mother
better than anyone.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.477
I could tell you stories...

07:58.479 --> 08:00.312
Well, that sounds nice.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.681
Peter, the two of you
should hang out together.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.416
I'd like that very much.

08:04.418 --> 08:07.652
Well, it's 4:00.
I'm off to bed.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.021
Wow, Peter, looks like
you made a new friend.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.257
Yeah... a-and maybe
she can be my new mom,

08:12.259 --> 08:14.159
you know, just like Greg
Evigan and Paul Reiser

08:14.161 --> 08:16.027
were briefly my two dads.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.596
I keep forgetting your names.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.166
Can you just be "Jew Dad"
and you'll be "Earring Dad?"

08:31.344 --> 08:33.879
Stewie, could you please
stop tossing and turning?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.013
It's hard enough
to sleep in here

08:35.015 --> 08:36.848
without my memory
foam pillow.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.351
Uh... don't tell me,
don't tell me...

08:39.353 --> 08:40.519
Brian!
Yep.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.853
Yeah...

08:41.855 --> 08:44.022
I can't go to sleep,
Brian-- I'm scared!

08:44.024 --> 08:44.856
Of what?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.891
Of death!

08:45.893 --> 08:47.459
Well, you're not alone.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.294
The world is full of people
who can't accept death.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.529
And they've all got
their own ideas

08:50.531 --> 08:51.897
of what happens when we die.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.231
Really? Like what?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.200
Tell me, are any of them
blindly reassuring?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.535
Look, it's late.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.869
We'll talk about it
first thing tomorrow.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.237
Geez, you know, I gotta say,

08:59.239 --> 09:01.239
it's weird to see you
so worked up about this.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.741
I mean, you're
not afraid of anything.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.242
Even that monster
in your closet.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.044
Ah, he's on his way
out of here.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.046
Ever since he violated
the section of his lease

09:08.048 --> 09:10.215
that doesn't
allow subletters.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.316
What are you talking about?

09:11.318 --> 09:12.717
I don't have
anyone else in here.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.453
Just tell him
the truth, Ethan.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.723
Thank you for doing this, Brian.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.058
No problem, Stewie.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.594
Our first stop today
is a Jewish synagogue.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.897
Wow, every brick in this place
is named after someone.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.732
Yeah, they do that
to honor their donors.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.835
So that side of the building
was donated by someone named,

09:30.837 --> 09:32.103
"Get Out of Our Town"?

09:32.105 --> 09:34.239
No, I-I-I think that was
the work of some

09:34.241 --> 09:35.607
shaved-headed gentlemen,

09:35.609 --> 09:37.509
but, but we're here
to talk about Judaism.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.411
So, where do they think
they go when they die?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.079
Well, you should try
asking the rabbi.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.415
Although, I should warn you,
you might not get an answer.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.251
So, where do Jewish people
think they go when they die?

09:46.253 --> 09:48.019
Where do you think we go?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.688
Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.424
Why do you think you're
asking all these questions?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.426
I-I just, I just really
want to know what happens.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.429
Do you think that's
part of God's infinite plan?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.031
I think your whole religion
is a sham, just so you can get

10:00.033 --> 10:01.600
extra holidays off from work.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.368
Oop, gotta go.
It's Buchwuch.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.443
I say, this is quite impressive.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.612
Buddhism is an
Asian religion that also has

10:13.614 --> 10:15.714
a significant following
of annoying white people.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.283
Okay.
See, these guys believe
that after you die,

10:18.285 --> 10:19.951
you're reincarnated
and you come back

10:19.953 --> 10:22.120
as a pig or a cow
or a rooster.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.655
Okay, okay, that's good.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.557
I already know what noises
to make if I'm one of those.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.726
But they also don't believe
in demonstrating emotions

10:27.728 --> 10:29.628
either way, so they're
the worst people

10:29.630 --> 10:31.129
to buy birthday gifts for.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.231
I know you've been having
trouble getting around,

10:33.233 --> 10:34.966
so I bought you a new Lexus.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.801
And I got you
this tie clip.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.237
Thank you both.
These are equal to me.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.140
Screw you!
You don't even own a tie!

10:46.479 --> 10:49.314
Now, the Catholics believe that
as long as you accept Jesus

10:49.316 --> 10:51.650
before you die, anyone
can get into Heaven.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.051
Really? Anyone?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.890
I accept Jesus
as my Lord and Savior!

11:00.660 --> 11:02.060
Yes!

11:05.865 --> 11:09.000
Peter, thank you so much for
your help in making this cake,

11:09.002 --> 11:10.669
but don't you think
it would be easier

11:10.671 --> 11:12.037
if you stood
on the floor?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.039
Yeah, but when I baked
with my mom,

11:14.041 --> 11:15.840
I always stood
on a chair.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.677
Another memory is
my Uncle Roy putting
his thumb in me.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.346
Ah, the best memories
are family memories.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.848
Oh, hey, Evelyn,
I got a riddle for you:

11:23.850 --> 11:26.384
What newspaper
do cows read?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.353
The <i>Moo York Times.</i>

11:28.355 --> 11:30.622
That's very clever, Peter.
Did you make that up?

11:30.624 --> 11:32.457
Nah, I got it off
a yogurt.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.892
Still, very impressive.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.393
God, you know, Evelyn,

11:35.395 --> 11:36.895
you've really helped me
through a tough time.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.863
I haven't been
this grateful

11:38.865 --> 11:40.732
since I met
the Sane Hatter.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.867
Excuse me. How do I get back
through the looking glass?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.302
Oh, yeah,
take two lefts

11:44.304 --> 11:46.204
and it's the first
door on your right.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.405
Cool. Great.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.807
Thanks for not giving me
the runaround.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.241
I-I asked that guy
over there,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.410
but he just told me
a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.947
Oh, yeah-- he's, like,
a well-known dick.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.587
What are you
still doing awake?

12:02.589 --> 12:03.922
Changing the oil in my car!

12:03.924 --> 12:05.657
What the hell do you think
I'm doing?!

12:05.659 --> 12:08.226
Sorry, I stole that from the
Italian family next door.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.994
They've been going
at it all night.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.330
GIRL:
Dad, can I have five dollars
for lunch tomorrow?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.499
MAN:
Yeah, sure, just
let me just go check

12:14.501 --> 12:16.234
my room full
of gold and jewels.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.604
You see, every first thing
he says is not the real thing.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.740
Anyway, Brian, I'm trying
to figure out death!

12:21.742 --> 12:23.942
It's not that
complicated, Stewie.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.111
Well, which of these religions
has the right answer?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.612
What-What about
you, Brian?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.347
What do you believe
happens when you die?

12:29.349 --> 12:31.416
Nothing.
Lights out. That's it.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.184
That's not comforting at all!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.019
Well, I just think
it's pretty clear

12:35.021 --> 12:37.188
that we're all just bags
of bones and flesh

12:37.190 --> 12:39.524
that eventually break down
and decay into worm food.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.926
We come from nothing,
and we're gonna
become nothing.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.495
The end.
Night, Stewie.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.765
Lights out.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.767
Did you hear him, Rupert?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.635
Life is just a big joke.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.138
It's just sitting
around waiting to die.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.873
Well, I can't live like that.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.141
I'd rather just end it.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.709
I'm going to take my own life.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.612
But first, I'm gonna play ball
in the house.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.848
(gasps)
Parents are right!

13:06.485 --> 13:10.855
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to
<i>S.T., the Special Terrestrial.</i>

13:14.560 --> 13:16.661
Hi!

13:16.663 --> 13:18.062
Hey, guys,
this is Evelyn.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.798
She's the one
with that bathroom carpet

13:19.800 --> 13:21.900
I've been peeing on
I told you about.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.401
Hey, nice to meet you.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.336
You know, instead
of drawing on your eyebrows,

13:25.338 --> 13:27.305
maybe just go without
eyebrows.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.808
And I'm Joe Swanson.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.076
I've been dying to introduce
you guys to Evelyn.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.912
We've just been having
the best time together.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.313
Evelyn, tell them
how many sodas

13:35.315 --> 13:36.815
I combined
at the movie theater.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.150
Two.
It was more than that.
She fell asleep.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.854
She let me drive
a little bit on the way home.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.155
Just in the parking lot.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.591
But you were a good
little navigator.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.262
Yeah, I just remembered, I gotta
get the hell out of here.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.202
Well, God said I could
walk just one time.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.738
I was saving it for
Susie's wedding day, but...

14:03.943 --> 14:05.510
Your friends seem lovely.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.111
Ah, they a'ight.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.848
You know, Evelyn, I am having
such a good time with you.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.683
You're like
my aboveground mom.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.852
Oh, Peter, you know, sometimes

14:13.854 --> 14:15.854
I think your mother
brought us together.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.522
Yeah, tha-that's how I feel.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.923
Good.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.428
(whimpering)

14:27.366 --> 14:29.534
<i>(The Price Is Right</i>
<i>theme plays)</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:32.937
Come on. Are you molesting me
or watching TV?

14:38.811 --> 14:41.646
I can't believe that
old woman kissed you!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.147
Oh, it was horrible, Lois.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.083
There were still crumbs
in the corners of her mouth

14:45.085 --> 14:47.719
from that Nilla Wafer
she had at lunch.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.054
Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.823
No, no, those were
definitely Nilla Wafers.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.825
And it really
bums me out, you know,

14:53.827 --> 14:56.094
'cause I thought she was
something special.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.896
She was like a mom to me.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.231
Well, then you should
go talk to her

15:00.233 --> 15:01.599
and try to clear
this up.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.068
It sounds weird, but
maybe it was innocent.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.904
I mean, this wouldn't
be the first time

15:05.906 --> 15:07.739
you thought someone
was hitting on you.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.908
Would you like
to add chips and a drink?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.843
Here we go again.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.983
All right, Rupert, here we go.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.590
Well, I'm not dead,
but I do have a boner.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.993
So that is something new
about Stewie.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.765
Okay, death by cop.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.769
Hey, copper, come get me!

15:37.771 --> 15:39.771
(flatly):
Oh, no, an armed assailant!

15:39.773 --> 15:41.940
I definitely don't want
to die today.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.109
I have so much
to live for.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.611
Come on! Shoot me!

15:46.613 --> 15:49.314
The one day I don't wear
my bulletproof vest!

15:49.316 --> 15:51.616
What are you waiting for?
I'm wide open!

15:51.618 --> 15:54.118
Don't you hate how the heart
is right about here?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.688
Just kiss, you fruitcakes!

16:00.392 --> 16:03.695
All right, Rupert, the old
toaster in the tub never fails.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.030
(gasping, shuddering)

16:10.235 --> 16:13.705
Oh, damn, I wanted to die,
not turn into Toaster Man.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.142
I don't know
about this Toaster Man.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.812
While he's getting all the
glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left

16:20.814 --> 16:22.180
to clean up the crumbs.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.848
(zap)

16:23.850 --> 16:26.818
(gasps) My breakfast bread
just got perfectly browned!

16:26.820 --> 16:28.987
I just wish I could thank him!

16:28.989 --> 16:30.655
Oh, I think he knows, Pop.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.224
I think he knows.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.763
Evelyn, we need to talk.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.432
Oh, Peter,
I owe you an apology.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.602
I'm afraid
my new medicine made me
act foolishly yesterday.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.671
You must forgive me.
Oh.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.674
So it-it was, it was
just your medicine, huh?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.676
Well, I guess I can
understand that.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.778
You know, I'm addicted
to nasal spray.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.416
I smell everything!
I'm invincible!

17:00.619 --> 17:01.886
(panting)

17:01.888 --> 17:04.022
I'm probably gonna be
a little down

17:04.024 --> 17:06.024
until I use
the spray again.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.192
That's okay, Peter.
Now come along.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.429
I've got quite the day
planned for us.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.298
♪ She's just a devil woman

17:14.300 --> 17:16.200
♪ With evil on her mind

17:16.202 --> 17:18.703
♪ Beware the devil woman

17:18.705 --> 17:20.638
♪ She's gonna get you

17:20.640 --> 17:22.540
♪ She's just a devil woman

17:22.542 --> 17:24.709
♪ With evil on her mind

17:24.711 --> 17:26.210
♪ Beware the devil woman

17:26.212 --> 17:28.946
♪ She's gonna get you
from behind. ♪

17:37.656 --> 17:39.157
Evelyn, I think it's best

17:39.159 --> 17:41.225
that we don't see
each other anymore.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.226
But Peter...

17:42.228 --> 17:43.661
No, Evelyn, I trusted you,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.329
and all this funny business
keeps happening,

17:45.331 --> 17:47.398
and I don't think
it's your medicine at all.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.434
So I'm afraid this is good-bye.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.936
But Peter, I thought
we were friends.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.604
Yeah, right.
You tricked me!

17:53.606 --> 17:56.340
You're as bad as those
predators on the Internet.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.909
That's wild, Stacey.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.945
I'm a 12-year-old girl, too.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.914
My name's Jenny.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.584
Want to come over to my place
and help me move?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.486
(doorbell rings)

18:09.455 --> 18:11.122
Hey, you're not
a 12-year-old girl!

18:11.124 --> 18:13.257
Neither are you, Jenny!

18:13.259 --> 18:15.760
Huh. I guess we aren't
so different after all.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.962
Yeah. You know, this isn't
a whole lot of stuff.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.531
We can probably knock
this out in an hour.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.174
What the hell?!

18:31.276 --> 18:32.710
Stewie, what the hell
are you doing?!

18:32.712 --> 18:35.613
MAN:
He's doing his taxes!
What's it look like he's doing?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.782
WOMAN:
Vito, get away from
the neighbors' house!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.117
I'm killing myself,
Brian.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.785
You said it yourself,
when we die,

18:40.787 --> 18:42.954
there's nothing!
We just rot in the ground!

18:42.956 --> 18:44.288
Well, if life has
no purpose,

18:44.290 --> 18:45.823
why not just cut
to the chase?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.458
Look, Stewie, I know
you're worried,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.794
but you can't live your life
being scared of death.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.229
Nobody knows
what comes next,

18:51.231 --> 18:53.898
so all we can do is pack
the most we can

18:53.900 --> 18:55.233
into each day we've got.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.801
So for you,
that's taking

18:56.803 --> 18:59.170
a 45-minute shaky-leg poop
on the front lawn?

18:59.172 --> 19:00.571
I'm just saying
there's something

19:00.573 --> 19:02.240
to be said for living
in the moment.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.808
So what you're saying is

19:03.810 --> 19:05.676
I've got to find
<i>my</i> shaky-leg poop.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.478
Exactly.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.980
Well, I-I have
always wanted

19:08.982 --> 19:10.915
to be a singer-songwriter.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.584
Um... yeah. No, yeah,
you could do that.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.852
You-you paused.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.020
Why-why did you pause?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.922
Uh... no reason.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.924
You did it again!
I swear to God,

19:19.926 --> 19:21.859
I will throw myself
right out that window!

19:21.861 --> 19:24.362
Okay, welcome
to the Apple Tree Pub.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.831
I'm Stewie Griffin,
and these...

19:26.833 --> 19:29.333
are my six assistants.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.835
You know,
I changed my mind.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.503
Kill yourself.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.010
Hey, Mom, I-I gotta talk
to you about something.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.212
You know, ever since
you turned into a rock

19:41.214 --> 19:42.780
with your name on it,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.683
your friend's been
really inappropriate with me.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.552
Hello, Peter.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.719
Oh. Hi.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.521
What are you doing here?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.390
Peter, I want
to apologize.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.859
I  <i>did</i>behave
inappropriately.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.961
It's just that since
my beloved Walter died,

19:56.963 --> 20:00.031
you're the first man who's paid
any attention to me,

20:00.033 --> 20:03.067
and I guess I took advantage
of that.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.535
Huh.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.138
Well, you know,
when-when you put it that way,

20:07.140 --> 20:10.541
I guess maybe it's a little bit
my fault, too.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.577
I missed my mom so much,

20:12.579 --> 20:16.714
and I guess maybe I sort
of used you as a replacement.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.151
I'm glad we
became friends, Evelyn.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.559
(gasps, bones crack)

20:29.228 --> 20:32.063
Evelyn? Evelyn?!

20:47.412 --> 20:51.282
Looks like somebody's mom died
or something,

20:51.284 --> 20:54.352
I don't know. You--You'll take
care of this, right?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.155
