(Doc coughing)

01:45.063 --> 01:46.814
(knocks)

01:53.238 --> 01:55.114
Doc.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.950
- How you feelin'?
- Sleepy...

01:58.118 --> 02:01.579
as a man fuckin' should at this hour,
if you don't mind me sayin'.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.665
It's this hour I'm able to see to you at.

02:06.418 --> 02:10.213
I understand and I'm grateful.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.550
At least half that fuckin' statement's
a fuckin' lie.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.720
(coughing)

02:22.142 --> 02:23.893
Take it easy, Doc.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.437
(panting)
Try and get dressed today.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.900
(coughing)

02:55.384 --> 02:57.802
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.055
- What the fuck is that to me?
- Telegram for Jane Cannary.

03:01.223 --> 03:04.892
Oh, yeah? Well, here's a pistol
for whatever your stupid fuckin' name is.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.478
Please do not kill me.
I'm only messenger.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.730
Shut the fuck up
and read the message!

03:24.121 --> 03:26.122
(applause)

03:33.171 --> 03:35.548
- (applause)
- Man: Yeah! All right.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.391
How'd Al answer?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.603
- He didn't answer at all.
- Good for him.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.274
Mornin'.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.278
Mornin'.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.615
Mornin'. Best time of day
to go fuck yourself.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.331
"From Samuel Fields
to Miss Jane Cannary."

04:08.498 --> 04:10.374
I don't know any Samuel Fields.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.127
Valediction is "Nigger General."

04:13.295 --> 04:15.463
Gimme that fuckin' thing.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.048
And keep the fuckin' contents to yourself!

04:18.216 --> 04:20.801
Trust, gentlemen and ladies,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.971
we live in faith!

04:27.142 --> 04:29.018
John Langrishe, madam,

04:29.186 --> 04:31.437
wishing you good morning
on an august occasion.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.440
- Morning.
- Hoping to walk with you a bit

04:34.608 --> 04:37.818
better to represent my intentions
this day than the last.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.946
- All right.
- May I ask your name?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.031
Joanie Stubbs.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.284
I regret having abrupted upon you,
Miss Stubbs, as you gardened.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.330
I took you for interested in something
you mightn't have been.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.457
My interest, to be direct,

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
is in buying your building.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.213
What do you want to use it for?

04:57.381 --> 05:00.383
A theater. My troupe
will season in this camp.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.134
It's a schoolhouse now.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.929
Then very handsomely appointed
for that purpose.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
It was a whorehouse before.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.103
Anyways, I don't know if I'd want to sell.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.438
Perhaps you'd consider renting.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.191
Perhaps you'd consider
fucking yourself.

05:37.129 --> 05:41.590
If I was approaching you backwards, Captain,
and had a mirror to observe your activity,

05:41.758 --> 05:44.343
just now I'd be most trepidatious,

05:44.511 --> 05:47.763
for, Johnny, this is a man
when acting from behind

05:47.931 --> 05:51.350
and advantaged with a weapon
is very much to be feared.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.227
I was just doing my job.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.570
You don't want to speak like that
again to Mr. Hearst.

06:02.738 --> 06:07.700
Yeah, I do. Do you want
to try to change my fuckin' mind?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.994
Not only will I change your mind,

06:10.162 --> 06:12.955
I'll rip your whole fucking head off.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.964
Another fuckin' invite.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.760
Fuckin' Hearst must take me
for an optimist.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.762
I'm gonna kill that cocksucker.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.222
All in good time.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.362
I'm curious about those tables
with the numbers on them.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.324
Well, they're for gambling on, those.

06:48.492 --> 06:52.703
Various kinds of games of chance
or of different sorts.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.039
So I imagined.

06:55.207 --> 06:59.376
I wonder if this might be
a convenient time for me to learn?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.798
Leon, uh, take over
supervising for me

07:03.965 --> 07:07.510
while I give this young lady
some private instruction.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.012
Yes, sir. Supervising now, sir.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.265
Uh, this over here is a choice table.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.434
Horatio, beat it.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.145
Am I inconveniencing you?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.107
Oh-- (chuckles)
damn Chinks.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.984
They shrunk these pants
in the laundry. (chuckles)

07:24.152 --> 07:26.153
You ever throw
the bones before, ma'am?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.863
I've caught some.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.533
(snickers)

07:32.285 --> 07:34.328
Con:
These are my personal dice.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.540
Nice, uh, fuckin' set.

07:37.707 --> 07:41.377
I'm happy and glad
to allow you to learn on 'em.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.799
(blows)

07:46.967 --> 07:48.676
(moans)

07:48.844 --> 07:51.720
(sighs)
Damn Chinks.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.361
I should cut your salary 20%!

08:07.529 --> 08:09.446
(panting) Uh...

08:09.614 --> 08:13.117
Based on time you're absent
campaigning.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.369
Could I make up the hours
once I'm beat?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.288
Your plans are idiotic.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.499
You're running for sheriff
to be a fireman.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.501
And hope to be second deputy

08:22.669 --> 08:25.129
in case they start a fire department.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.631
Well, that's stupid!
And I ought to cut your salary.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.301
You have to, you have to.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.386
Why not build a fuckin' fire wagon

08:33.554 --> 08:36.265
that you then rent out to the camp?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.558
If I had money.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.395
If you had a loan
for the wagon's makings

08:42.563 --> 08:44.773
and help with the fuckin' carpentry,

08:44.941 --> 08:47.067
would you build the wagon then?

08:47.235 --> 08:52.031
Uh, I'd repay you
at fuckin' interest, boss.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.200
Well, that's the 20%,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.620
pre-deducted
from the makings' purchase.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.705
We build the fuckin' wagon

08:59.873 --> 09:02.374
then rent it to the camp.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.253
And don't ever speak of this again.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.675
A-a-a-and two fuckin' fire hats.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.014
Nigger General ain't quit drinkin',
we know that for fuckin' sure.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.891
How do we know that?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.852
What you just read to me
is a drunkard's question:

09:22.020 --> 09:25.940
"What is state of affairs in camp
with regards to the horse?"

09:26.107 --> 09:29.360
Seems to me whatever the state of affairs
about the horse is in the camp,

09:29.527 --> 09:32.238
it's a drunkard's decision
bringin' the cocksucker back.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.115
That's on Hostetler,
according to the little Nigger General,

09:35.283 --> 09:37.368
if you'd understand
what you fuckin' read.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.829
Hostetler means to bring the horse back.
Hostetler!

09:42.624 --> 09:46.085
"You're right, Jane.
I'm a fuckin' moron as usual.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.712
What I should be doin',
being as you have no experience,

09:48.880 --> 09:52.675
is helping you compose a telegraph back
to little Nigger General as requested."

09:56.304 --> 10:00.266
Come over here and save yourself
the cost of a wire.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.314
Jane: Oh, fuck!

10:09.985 --> 10:12.444
What are you lookin' at, huh?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.573
You think just 'cause I happen to got
a peppermint, it's yours by right?

10:19.286 --> 10:22.496
Always possible I'm having a nightmare.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.208
You greedy sweet-toothed cocksucker.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.051
That's right. That's right.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.512
You come to take my place away.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.605
Oh, Miss Stubbs.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.357
Take a seat in that cell there

10:50.525 --> 10:52.568
till I square a place away for you.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.159
I have an offer to sell my place.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.619
How are you inclined to answer?

11:02.787 --> 11:06.832
Unless you don't yet know,
if I ain't out of place askin'.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.293
I told the man to fuck himself.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.296
Tactics or a true position?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.715
I don't know.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.384
I don't know, Mr. Utter.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.429
Why don't I close up for a while?

11:20.597 --> 11:23.182
Oh, please don't.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.775
Nigger General and Hostetler

11:32.942 --> 11:36.236
brung that horse back to camp,
got away from 'em

11:36.404 --> 11:38.405
and trampled the sheriff's boy.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.407
Is that so?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.954
Wherever the two of them was,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.166
I guess they didn't feel their lives
were in enough danger.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.378
Well, people will do strange things.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.714
For years at a time.
Pick any part of my life, for example.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.759
It just don't sit well with me.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.138
To sell your place, you mean?

12:03.306 --> 12:05.265
But I can't think why I wouldn't.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.267
What's wrong with whim for a reason?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.311
I'll tell you what I like.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.106
What I like is knowing
these children are learning.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.734
I like that, and I like
watering their garden

12:15.902 --> 12:17.903
the days they ain't in session.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.407
The day that school opened
I remember sayin' to Sheriff Bullock

12:21.574 --> 12:25.327
what a nice thing it seemed...

12:25.495 --> 12:28.330
watching them little ones
walk off to your place.

12:28.498 --> 12:33.460
That's what I goddamn like,
imagining them walkin' into it.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.798
I ain't seen it yet, but I'd like to,

12:37.966 --> 12:43.679
and when he wanted to buy it,
all I thought's "Now I never will."

12:43.847 --> 12:46.098
(sighs)

12:46.266 --> 12:50.310
Oh God Almighty.
(sighs)

12:52.689 --> 12:56.191
- What is it, Miss Stubbs?
- I wish once

12:56.359 --> 13:00.863
I could... care for those little ones.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.948
(sobs)

13:04.409 --> 13:08.245
Just once instead
of doin' what I did.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.664
There, there now.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.962
Walked in like the past six weeks
never fuckin' happened.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.048
Never fuckin' left the camp!

13:20.216 --> 13:23.552
Never fuckin' abandoned
the fuckin' horses to starve,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.679
or die of fuckin' thirst.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.765
Nigger motherfuckers!

13:30.852 --> 13:34.938
Harry, what the fuck
are you waitin' for?!

13:36.816 --> 13:39.067
What are you talking about, Steve?

13:39.235 --> 13:43.697
What I swore up and down was gonna
happen and nobody paid me any heed.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.949
What happened to me in Utica

13:46.117 --> 13:49.286
and every other fuckin' place
I've ever been in my fuckin' life!

13:49.454 --> 13:52.998
The white man bears the nigger's weight

13:53.166 --> 13:56.627
around his neck like a fucking albatross.

13:56.794 --> 14:01.131
And yet people still ask,
"Well, why is he bent over?!

14:01.299 --> 14:05.093
And why can he barely fuckin' walk?!"

14:08.890 --> 14:11.099
The livery's gone.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.393
All my labor,

14:13.561 --> 14:16.104
efforts are gone for naught.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.359
And they walked in
like they never fucking left,

14:20.527 --> 14:23.237
and they didn't take responsibility

14:23.404 --> 14:25.822
for trampling that white boy!

14:25.990 --> 14:30.494
Nor did they give less than a flyin' fuck!

14:39.796 --> 14:41.755
And I wonder what the fuckin' parents

14:41.923 --> 14:44.091
are gonna say about that too!

14:48.930 --> 14:52.140
Why don't you stand down
over there, Harry?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.205
Many thanks.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.333
If you stay in camp long, sir,

15:18.501 --> 15:20.335
you may have the delightful surprise

15:20.503 --> 15:22.504
of meeting your identical twin.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.093
He has appointed to degrade himself.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.013
The open question is with whom.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.606
- Now we'll find out about you.
- What is it?

15:40.773 --> 15:43.650
Or justice for the white man
or for your own dead child.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.321
At the saloon No. fucking 10!

15:47.488 --> 15:51.325
- Well, are you coming?
- Yeah, I'm fucking coming.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.582
Mrs. Ellsworth.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.545
You don't confuse me
with Mrs. Bullock?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.759
Well, as far as the conjugal enterprise,

16:08.926 --> 16:11.470
I'll admit often feeling like a schoolboy.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.305
Thank you for it.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.516
Speaking further,
'twixt your mine and now this bank,

16:16.684 --> 16:20.562
however much I mayn't be good at it,
I feel I married rather well.

16:20.730 --> 16:24.691
Depositor: I put you on notice:
Want my money, it better be available,

16:24.859 --> 16:26.735
day or fucking night.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.613
Mayn't I draw you a map then
in case it's night you want it,

16:29.781 --> 16:32.532
to lead you to where I live
so you can wake me?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.534
Now fuck you then.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.703
- I ain't depositing.
- Oh no.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.707
Oh, say it ain't fuckin' so,
you stupid fucking asshole!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.209
Now now now now.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.378
Now now, fucking what?!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.129
Now now, keep your voice down.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.674
- Who the fuck are you anyway?
- Sir--

16:48.841 --> 16:50.425
Stay out of this.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.512
Deposits here,
if we fucking let you make 'em,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.639
are backed by this lady's gold mine.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.434
So do not confuse her with some
paper palace fly-by-night

16:59.602 --> 17:02.020
who means "Catch me if you can,
turn me upside down

17:02.188 --> 17:05.232
and whatever falls out of my pants pocket
is what's behind my scrip,"

17:05.400 --> 17:07.901
when his note says "full faith and credit."

17:08.069 --> 17:09.819
Thank you, Mr. Ellsworth.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.239
She'd make the uses of money available

17:12.406 --> 17:15.409
for people in the camp
ain't belligerent cocksuckers.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.537
Short of following you around
with her fucking mine on her back,

17:18.704 --> 17:21.957
- how else is she supposed to do it?
- Thank you.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.000
- You're welcome.
- I am Mrs. Ellsworth.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.002
Yeah. How do you do?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.255
I...

17:28.423 --> 17:30.424
I guess I'll try you out.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.592
Our hearts fucking leap with joy.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.975
Keep him here.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.188
Now we'll see if he takes the nigger's word
or how they fucking lie.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.149
Shut up!

17:48.359 --> 17:51.361
Well, give me a drink
and it's a deal, Tom.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.907
Go on away from here now.
Ain't nobody trying to keep you.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.203
That's why I come back with you, Hostetler,
to worsen my chances when I try to flee.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.921
I was coming to find you
once I had the horse cleaned.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.215
This is the horse that hurt your boy.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.718
We collected him
and we brung him back.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.470
He died.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.144
The horse escaped in my care,

18:24.312 --> 18:27.272
you may hold the boy's dying
against me.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.484
Hostetler took precautions.
We was trying to nut the horse--

18:30.651 --> 18:32.569
Shut-- shut up now.
Shut up.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.238
I collected the horse
and brought him back.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.240
I'm back too.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.701
You say what you think is right.

18:41.162 --> 18:45.165
I'm not gonna act against you
for an accident.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.004
Your boy...

18:51.172 --> 18:54.007
I'm as sorry as I can be.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.093
I hope you will take that
to his mother for me.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.142
I'm here to talk about the livery.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.020
I feel sorry running away from this too.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.649
It's a shame
leaving animals uncared for.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.569
Wanting not to be killed
will put you to some difficult choices.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.697
Steve's been looking after the place.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.367
Hostetler:
Did damn good at the first look.

19:20.535 --> 19:23.411
Any chance to keep hell
from breaking loose between you?

19:23.579 --> 19:26.039
He left out of here
shouting and screaming

19:26.207 --> 19:29.251
off of me saying thanks for looking out.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.546
I'm asking, Hostetler, far as you go,

19:32.713 --> 19:35.090
does hell have to break loose?

19:35.258 --> 19:39.344
No, hell don't have to break loose.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.013
Con:
A colleague of mine Leon,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.975
out of the Bella Union--
you might not have noticed him--

19:45.142 --> 19:48.603
Leon remarks to me after you left

19:48.771 --> 19:51.147
"That young lady had
a front porch on her

19:51.315 --> 19:54.192
a fella could read
a book off of." (laughing)

19:56.737 --> 19:59.573
You know Leon said that unsolicited.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.617
It's time to go.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.414
In a few days

20:07.582 --> 20:10.333
we can do this again.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.587
Uh, Captain will be back at the helm!

20:15.172 --> 20:17.257
Mr. Langrishe,

20:17.425 --> 20:21.136
I couldn't possibly
consider your offer

20:21.304 --> 20:24.306
unless you would agree

20:24.473 --> 20:26.933
to building a new schoolhouse

20:27.101 --> 20:30.729
at your expense
for Mrs. Bullock and the children.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.148
Well, who could say no to that?

20:33.316 --> 20:38.111
Well, what-- what if Mrs. Bullock
doesn't want a change of location?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.488
I can't think of why
she'd prefer teaching

20:40.656 --> 20:43.783
in an ex-brothel over a place
new-built for schooling.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.828
People are strange
about things, Charlie.

20:46.996 --> 20:50.999
But if you like, I'll get her say-so.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.377
And then I'll speak to Mr. Langrishe.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.049
Why don't we talk
at the hardware store?

20:59.216 --> 21:01.051
Why don't we talk right here?

21:01.218 --> 21:03.845
- Tom: A 30-minute recess, boys.
- No recess on my account.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.307
I don't want my getting fucked
to put others to inconvenience.

21:07.475 --> 21:11.937
No one's here to fuck you, Steve,
if you'd just quit running your mouth.

21:15.650 --> 21:19.027
First off, I thank you
for looking to the livery.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.822
He'll talk to me through you
or he won't get any fucking response.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.408
I'm grateful for the care
you gave the animals.

21:25.576 --> 21:30.121
Now you wait until
he translates from ape.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.166
(grunts)

21:33.334 --> 21:35.627
Don't insult him again.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.630
You being this kind of neutral sheriff

21:38.798 --> 21:42.342
is why I'm gonna vote
for Harry Manning.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.305
I want to pay you for your time
and your trouble.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.475
That's it?
Send me on my fucking way?

21:50.643 --> 21:53.728
And if you wanted to work there,

21:53.896 --> 21:56.815
I would be willing to keep you on.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.192
Steve:
Look at him, gritting his teeth,

21:59.360 --> 22:02.028
holding onto his fucking nose!

22:02.196 --> 22:04.864
Don't you do me
any fucking favors, Hostetler!

22:05.032 --> 22:09.035
I didn't ask permission
of anyone to look after that stock,

22:09.203 --> 22:12.497
and I'm not gonna start
with a fucking nigger!

22:12.665 --> 22:16.376
The sheriff will have your back pay
if you come to change your mind.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.545
Fuck you!

22:18.713 --> 22:22.799
I was answerable to the horse
that trampled his boy.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.010
Camp being stirred up,

22:25.177 --> 22:27.220
if I lingered to make my arrangements

22:27.388 --> 22:29.931
I don't think I would have lived
to catch that horse.

22:30.099 --> 22:34.102
Ain't that the purest form
of nigger logic?

22:35.229 --> 22:38.231
He runs and he blames the white man

22:38.399 --> 22:40.150
and then he comes back

22:40.317 --> 22:42.444
and he treats him like dirt!

22:42.611 --> 22:47.157
Hey, when can I start working for you,
you fucking monkey ape?!

22:47.324 --> 22:49.868
Why don't you start
jumping up and down

22:50.036 --> 22:52.620
and pounding your chest

22:52.788 --> 22:55.707
and murder a few dozen lice?!

22:55.875 --> 22:58.084
You motherfucker.

22:58.252 --> 23:01.880
- What did you say about my mother?!
- You motherfuckers.

23:02.048 --> 23:06.676
- What did you just say about these people!
- You ofay motherfuckers!

23:06.844 --> 23:10.555
(yelps) Put me down until
you're ready to kill me or run.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.557
Seth:
You're gonna leave this to me.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.934
Do you understand?
You leave it to me.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.228
I came my part
and he wouldn't meet me.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.523
I'll take care of it.
Will you let me try?

23:20.691 --> 23:23.318
- It's what I want for my son.
- Put me down now.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.112
Seth: If I do, it won't be to kill you
and I'm not running.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.614
So what are we gonna do then?

23:27.782 --> 23:29.783
Put me down.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.996
I was gonna go to Oregon.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.208
You let him buy me out fair
and I'll fucking go.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.628
I'll be at the livery.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.350
He'll sell to you.
Do you want to take it on?

23:55.518 --> 23:57.727
I don't have the means to purchase it.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.729
If you had the means at loan?

23:59.897 --> 24:01.773
Yes, I'd be willing, very much so.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.484
No bargain.
My partner would make the price.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.945
You'd say yes or no.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.573
Yeah, I'm interested,
if I had the means at loan.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.166
What do you think of that?

24:20.334 --> 24:21.668
Utter:
Sheriff Bullock.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.671
Trying to broker some settlement
between Steve and Hostetler.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.006
Well, I'll find you later then.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.384
Be quick, you got me now.

24:30.845 --> 24:35.098
Must've been unwelcome to Mrs. Bullock,
that horse being brought back.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.392
Not wanting to intrude on her,

24:37.560 --> 24:40.895
Miss Stubbs having
asked me to find out,

24:41.063 --> 24:43.273
might I ask you to speak in her stead

24:43.440 --> 24:47.068
as to something I believe
we both know where she stand on?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.612
Is that your goddamn idea
of quick, Charlie?

24:51.407 --> 24:53.241
Miss Stubbs,

24:53.409 --> 24:56.870
that owns the Chez Amis building
where Mrs. Bullock teaches,

24:57.037 --> 25:00.707
has got asked to name
a price which she'd sell at.

25:00.875 --> 25:04.836
She got stipulations and likes
of which I won't bore you with,

25:05.004 --> 25:06.963
but her big worry,

25:07.131 --> 25:09.799
if the buyer on his own nickel

25:09.967 --> 25:13.094
were to put a new schoolhouse up
elsewhere,

25:13.262 --> 25:16.222
would Mrs. Bullock
be loathe to leave the Chez?

25:16.390 --> 25:18.391
Why would she be loathe to leave it?

25:18.559 --> 25:21.728
Can I take that as a no
as if from your wife's own lips?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.688
Yeah.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.066
Thank you.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.069
Sorry to hold you up.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.198
"Be quick."

25:33.365 --> 25:35.408
Fucking delicate operation.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.536
(humming)

25:42.082 --> 25:43.750
Jack.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.296
One thought he'd
engaged a room for you

25:48.464 --> 25:50.298
at the other end of the hall.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.383
I'm going to it now.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.145
Invites me and Tolliver for a chat.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.774
What the fuck is in his head?
Does he think he broke me?

26:07.942 --> 26:11.736
Does this cocksucker think he broke me
and now we're at his beck and call?

26:11.904 --> 26:14.322
Oh, Jesus Christ, get your head off it.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.909
Get your fucking head off it for all
the fucking good you're doing down there.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.994
That's all I need: at the perfect juncture

26:20.162 --> 26:22.789
you to alter your action and forget
your previous method.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.166
I didn't alter my action.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.293
No?

26:27.461 --> 26:29.963
Is my dick in your mouth?

26:30.130 --> 26:33.049
Do I have a hard-on?
Then you change your action.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.551
Go back to your previous fucking method.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.766
Hmm.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.852
Does he construe
my forbearance as weakness

26:45.020 --> 26:46.938
is what the fuck nags at me?

26:47.106 --> 26:50.275
Or my considerations of alternatives

26:50.442 --> 26:52.318
for being fucking intimidated?

26:52.486 --> 26:54.821
Because the time's coming
he sees what I'm up to

26:54.989 --> 26:56.739
beyond any fucking mistake.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.741
And I only hope you don't doubt it.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.535
Huh, you see?!

27:00.703 --> 27:03.579
Y-y-y-you don't think that counts
as altering your action?

27:03.747 --> 27:06.040
You would change your entire
fucking mouth pattern.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.667
Sorry.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.128
Sorry?
Oh, I guess that's okay then--

27:10.296 --> 27:12.839
because my goal before my meeting

27:13.007 --> 27:15.425
wasn't to come
and clear my fucking head,

27:15.592 --> 27:17.802
not so much as to hear you
say you're sorry,

27:17.970 --> 27:20.013
you stupid fucking mutt.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.265
- Should I go?
- No.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.810
Tell me who you want
in the election.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.147
Star for mayor and Harry Manning
for sheriff.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.608
Star for mayor and Bullock
for fucking sheriff.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.153
Bullock yells at you.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.198
Get out.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.785
Shut up and get out.

27:52.046 --> 27:55.048
Does he think I'm fucking afraid?

28:02.723 --> 28:05.558
- Young man.
- Jack.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.520
Less throb today, one hopes,
in the phantom digit.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.774
Not to fucking mention
elsewhere, huh?

28:12.941 --> 28:16.652
Might I ask you what you know of
a Miss Stubbs that owns the Chez Amis?

28:16.820 --> 28:20.239
- Whoremistress.
- Not presently active, I'm told.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.951
Hearst's geologist
killed three of her girls.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.246
The three he didn't, she hid under
canvas and spirited out of camp.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.624
Now lets her place as a schoolhouse.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.834
My impression, she donates it.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.337
To cleanse the camp's idea of her?

28:34.505 --> 28:37.840
Would that base her turning away
a theater type's offer to buy?

28:38.008 --> 28:40.885
Wouldn't enter into it.
Cares for a gut-shot shitbird

28:41.053 --> 28:44.055
no one in camp has time for,
nor she has any love for either.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.766
Loyal, see? That type.

28:46.934 --> 28:50.728
Some sentimentality, do you suppose,
about the building itself?

28:50.896 --> 28:53.856
Might that account for her holding on?

28:54.024 --> 28:56.859
I wouldn't know, Jack.
She's all right.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.280
Must think I'm a fucking dog--

29:01.448 --> 29:04.784
forgives the blow
first friendly scratch of the ear.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.830
Invites me back to his rooms,
fucking Hearst.

29:08.997 --> 29:13.543
Shall I accompany?
As your second.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.337
My obvious unsuitability
might confuse him.

29:16.505 --> 29:19.340
- (chuckles)
- Do survive.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.563
EB.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.398
EB:
The Titans gather.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.484
- Swearengen.
- Tolliver.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.570
Do we now assault Olympus?

29:40.737 --> 29:43.698
Quiet, EB.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.832
I think Cochran's a lunger.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.377
A bit motley ourselves, huh?

30:02.342 --> 30:04.343
What would you make
that livery worth?

30:04.511 --> 30:06.721
- I'd have to look into it.
- I need a figure now.

30:06.889 --> 30:10.558
1200 if you made me say
without investigating.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.565
Leon:
Laying by for the future.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.985
- Alma: Very forward looking.
- Oh, I'm keen-eyed,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.362
ahead and behind.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.576
Your mark would go there.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.745
I'll sign my name, Mrs. Garret.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.915
I've been lettered since I was 12.

30:36.460 --> 30:40.671
Since you can read, you may wish
to examine my nameplate.

30:42.299 --> 30:45.510
Mrs. Ellsworth, I'm-- I'm very sorry

30:45.677 --> 30:48.012
and very very apologetic.

30:50.724 --> 30:54.560
Perhaps you would finish signing
over there while I attend to Mr. Bullock.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.229
Opened an account.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.484
- Mr. Bullock.
- I'd like that drunk Steve to have a loan--

31:01.652 --> 31:05.029
$1200, title to the livery
as collateral. I'll cosign the note.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.073
Has Steve clear title?

31:07.241 --> 31:09.700
He will once he's bought out Hostetler.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.205
That's what the money's for.

31:18.835 --> 31:22.922
- What is Steve-the-drunk's surname?
- Fields.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.884
$1200, Trixie,

31:27.052 --> 31:29.428
payable to a Mr. Steve Fields

31:29.596 --> 31:33.599
upon his signature and submission
of title to the livery,

31:33.767 --> 31:36.018
Mr. Bullock to cosign.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.271
All right.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.231
Thank you.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.084
My back's in frank rebellion.

32:00.252 --> 32:04.714
Uh, gentlemen, will you mind
if I keep to this angle?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.382
(heavy exhale)

32:06.550 --> 32:08.926
Hang upside down
from the ceiling for all of me.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.845
(chuckles)
It may come to that.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.557
Mr. Swearengen, I will take
your silence for assent.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.685
We pass another milestone.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.521
Bank of Deadwood opens its doors.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.190
Is not Mrs. Ellsworth a dynamo?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.192
Let's find one and send it to her.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.279
What's the occasion?
I have my physician to see.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.532
How are you indisposed,
Mr. Swearengen?

32:31.700 --> 32:34.118
Sick at the stomach.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.037
Hearst:
Would you wish to leave now?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.539
Mr. Tolliver can report
our conversation.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.750
Tough it out, Al, like me

32:40.917 --> 32:43.628
that's guts is more
outside his pants than in.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.338
The occasion?

32:45.505 --> 32:47.506
The camp comes to such an hour,

32:47.674 --> 32:49.842
I'd have us reach
a new understanding.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.429
- The "hour" meaning elections.
- I am given pause

32:53.597 --> 32:55.973
by the quality of...

32:56.141 --> 32:59.810
certain of the likely victors.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.356
But I have come to believe as well

33:03.523 --> 33:05.691
that my temperament ill suits me

33:05.859 --> 33:08.569
for environments
such as this one must become.

33:08.737 --> 33:12.990
And other opportunities
presenting themselves elsewhere,

33:13.158 --> 33:16.077
I may best serve
my own interests here

33:16.244 --> 33:19.288
- by standing at some remove.
- Are you leaving?

33:19.456 --> 33:22.249
Can you say it straight out
before I have a fucking birthday?

33:22.417 --> 33:25.002
I will be coming and going,
is that straight out enough?

33:25.170 --> 33:29.632
What's the task you'd give us?
And what's our fucking piece for doing 'em?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.300
- Cy: Al.
- Shut up.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.178
Hearst:
To not let become over-onerous

33:34.346 --> 33:39.600
my interests' encounter
with the camp's retrogressive elements.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.977
Meaning what, you phony bastard?

33:42.145 --> 33:45.981
- Who do we kill? What's our pay?
- It ain't fair to make it that simple, Al.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.776
Fuck you.
He took the pick to me simple enough.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.946
We will get to numbers quickly
once we've agreed in principle.

33:52.114 --> 33:55.408
Numbers are
the only principle I believe in,

33:55.575 --> 33:57.284
and naming what the numbers buy.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.370
When you and him come to 'em,

33:59.538 --> 34:02.373
tell fucking Adams
and he'll bring you my reply later.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.210
Him and me,
we've had our last word.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.926
What have the gods decreed?

34:14.094 --> 34:17.554
Too fearful and upset to relive it, EB.

34:19.099 --> 34:22.184
We do agree in principle?

34:22.351 --> 34:24.853
Oh, yes, sir.
Numbers and acts

34:25.021 --> 34:29.190
is what's left to discuss.
Sounds like a Bible study, don't it?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.196
Charlie read me the telegram,
then I seen 'em come into camp.

34:34.364 --> 34:37.241
My exact fucking thought, "Look, Jane,

34:37.409 --> 34:40.327
two dead niggers leading
a dead fucking horse."

34:40.495 --> 34:43.289
Matter came to rope,
Steve the drunk to cinch the noose.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.167
Charlie's right
for the first time in months.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.127
Fucking Steve.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.545
The exact type malicious cocksucker

34:50.714 --> 34:52.840
tars every fucking drunk with his brush.

34:53.007 --> 34:57.636
Anyway, here's Trixie
with the loan documents.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.848
This succeeds, Bullock,
what you're trying to work out here,

35:01.016 --> 35:05.019
I will doff hat to you
and no fucking mistake.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.229
Just don't let her take off her boots.

35:12.986 --> 35:16.363
Did you know Miss Stubbs
might sell her place?

35:19.159 --> 35:21.535
You gotta fucking sign.

35:32.881 --> 35:36.091
A lot of shitbags hang around a bank.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.886
Did you ever fucking notice?

35:45.560 --> 35:48.020
Asshole.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.902
Trailing clouds of glory.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.905
Do you read Wordsworth?

35:58.073 --> 35:59.949
I do not, madam, no.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.659
How do you come to ask?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.452
You've just quoted him.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.288
Well, I have a digest
from which I memorize,

36:06.456 --> 36:09.917
suppressing the authors' names.
Enjoy your supper.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.087
When will I raise courage

36:13.255 --> 36:15.756
to search that woman's room?

36:15.924 --> 36:18.759
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.221
Don't look to take her order.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.849
She likes to draw awhile
before she eats.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.769
"Bone weary but soldiering on."

36:28.937 --> 36:31.188
Bellegarde as a soldier?

36:31.356 --> 36:33.774
He is an actor, after all.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.986
But unless you would build
a new schoolhouse

36:37.153 --> 36:39.488
for Mrs. Bullock to teach
the camp's children in,

36:39.656 --> 36:43.409
I couldn't even begin to entertain
the idea of a sale.

36:43.577 --> 36:48.122
The most natural and constructive
of stipulations, Miss Stubbs.

36:48.290 --> 36:52.585
- At your expense, I hope you understand.
- I do.

36:52.752 --> 36:56.297
And may I submit
to you now my offer?

36:56.464 --> 36:58.215
Please do.

37:02.429 --> 37:05.222
Very generous.
Thank you.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.474
We've an agreement?

37:07.642 --> 37:10.603
Far as the schoolhouse...

37:10.770 --> 37:12.646
and its costs?

37:12.814 --> 37:16.901
Absolutely separate,
my obligation in that regard.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.904
- Those'd be exclusive.
- Exactly.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.115
They come to an understanding.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.618
She seems quite thin.

37:28.622 --> 37:30.915
Fields: Might be
where he first went wrong,

37:31.082 --> 37:33.375
learning to read and cipher.

37:33.543 --> 37:36.211
- Why ain't he sign first?
- Why ain't I half a foot taller?

37:36.379 --> 37:40.132
- You're who I came to first.
- Order's right and amount is fair.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.928
And once Steve signs, then I will.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.430
I'm not a goddamn
errand boy, Hostetler,

37:46.598 --> 37:48.974
to mule this thing back and forth.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.101
Give it to me.
Let me forge Steve's name.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.270
I ain't gonna be first to sign

37:53.438 --> 37:56.023
and look a cunt when he don't.

38:03.740 --> 38:07.159
Nigger, nigger, nigger.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.421
Where the fuck have you been?

38:19.589 --> 38:22.883
I was looking for someone whose name
you told me never to say again.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.344
Amongst further instructions including

38:25.512 --> 38:27.972
not to look for him
when he's fucking disappeared.

38:28.139 --> 38:32.977
- Well, I held off saying where I was.
- I can repose no truth in someone

38:33.144 --> 38:38.065
- who traffics with that type douche bag.
- I don't think Hawkeye's a douche bag.

38:38.233 --> 38:42.945
Who you believe you can salvage, Adams,
is the douche bag you must avoid,

38:43.113 --> 38:46.782
and no effort of yours can preclude
at some point finding past help.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.911
And you yourself, being his consort,
in similar fucking straits.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.831
And all the energies
I've poured into you gone for naught.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.793
I vow on the fucking subject,
I find you dead 'cause of him

38:57.961 --> 39:01.880
I'll kick your corpse in the ear
for the waste of my fucking time.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.759
Anyways, what'd you want?

39:05.927 --> 39:09.221
I've named you to represent me
in my dealings with fucking Hearst.

39:09.389 --> 39:13.017
- Tolliver too, in that connection.
- With Tolliver in connection with Hearst?

39:13.184 --> 39:15.811
As he's put us in tandem,
fucking Hearst.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.189
- You and Tolliver?
- If I sought an echo, Adams,

39:19.357 --> 39:21.483
I'd now be addressing
a fucking mountain.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.780
I'm in waters I don't know,

39:26.948 --> 39:30.701
nor soundings I can take.
To bring me the knowledge I need,

39:30.869 --> 39:33.620
my second needs to seem
capable of disloyalty.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.498
If that's supposed to be
a compliment, thanks.

39:36.666 --> 39:40.044
Get the fuck out.
Out out. Go. Get out.

39:40.211 --> 39:45.132
Which is to say, being loyal
he can forego loyalty's display.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.927
Like not searching out a friend
who don't want to be found,

39:49.095 --> 39:52.222
just hoping he makes
his way back, hmm?

39:55.602 --> 39:57.728
How's Dan gonna take
your choosing me?

39:57.896 --> 40:01.106
That's my fucking problem to deal with.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.776
Jack, how'd it go with that place?

40:03.943 --> 40:05.778
One has agreed beyond purchase

40:05.945 --> 40:09.156
to construct
a new schoolhouse elsewhere.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.534
That should go up prior,
not to interrupt the fucking teacher.

40:12.702 --> 40:15.621
Your law-giving tone is noted.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.462
Lovely smile.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.967
She sucks my prick.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.887
Her methods deserted her completely.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.975
Might varying

40:37.143 --> 40:40.312
the hour produce
a different outcome?

40:40.480 --> 40:44.108
What's the hour's relevance?
It's her technique's fucking awry.

40:46.027 --> 40:49.279
Anyway, Jack, gotta get my ear pissed in.
I'm glad about your place.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.199
Thank you, young man.
Glad you're still amongst us.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.995
Nor, one imagines,

40:57.163 --> 41:01.250
is the local creek rife with oysters.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.710
I'm onboard, Bullock.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.505
And you are looking at a grateful man,

41:06.673 --> 41:09.883
and who ain't appreciated you previous

41:10.051 --> 41:12.386
- the way he does now.
- Sign.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.556
We've accomplished
something here today!

41:15.723 --> 41:18.725
Take this agreement and this pen,

41:18.893 --> 41:21.937
go over to that livery

41:22.105 --> 41:24.648
and get that nigger's signature.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.152
I will.
Sign the fucking thing first.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.863
Let's not lose our sense of proportion

41:31.030 --> 41:33.198
this late phase in the process.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.619
Sign it!

41:40.540 --> 41:44.376
That nigger signs and then I'll accept.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.340
(clears throat)

41:52.177 --> 41:54.219
You know you hurt my feelings.

41:54.387 --> 41:57.139
- Dan.
- That's the long and short of it, Al.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.349
You fucking pick Adams
to represent you,

41:59.517 --> 42:02.644
you hurt my fucking feelings
and that is the fucking matter's end.

42:02.812 --> 42:04.521
Would you go against me?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.899
That is not what we're talking about.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.818
You know I'd never break loyalty.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.698
That don't mean
my feelings can't get hurt.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.243
Fucking point is you'd never
go against me. Tolliver knows.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.580
I need someone
he don't know that about.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.041
I don't think Silas
would go agin you neither.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.043
You and him haven't been through,

42:26.211 --> 42:29.379
me and him haven't been through
what me and you've been through.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.049
Hmm. Not by a long shot.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.385
So more than an opinion
ain't possible.

42:35.553 --> 42:39.264
Still, I'd be fucking surprised
if either of us was mistaken.

42:39.432 --> 42:42.434
Me too.

42:43.853 --> 42:47.105
(clears throat)
Fucking Doc.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.942
- Dan: What's his problem?
- Think he's a fucking lunger.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.944
Jesus Christ, it is

42:52.111 --> 42:55.405
one fucking thing after another.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.747
Observe a decent interval,

43:03.915 --> 43:07.167
and we'll give it another fucking whirl.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.474
Keep them separate,

43:22.642 --> 43:25.978
agree on a time tomorrow
when their dicks will be down,

43:26.145 --> 43:28.480
have them sign simultaneous.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.997
Petite and quite beautiful
your mother is,

43:45.164 --> 43:48.125
for being a financial powerhouse.

43:50.712 --> 43:54.006
Of service to the camp,
turning her mine into houses

43:54.173 --> 43:57.134
and the like getting built,
businesses begun.

43:57.302 --> 44:00.887
Some for people
that'll never know her name.

44:06.894 --> 44:10.939
I'll take the air, just briefly.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.859
I'll continue to be
beaten at checkers.

44:34.714 --> 44:38.008
Any fucking domicile
but the graveyard suits me fine.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.469
Don't you worry about me.

44:40.636 --> 44:43.722
I got things taken care of over here.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.932
Joanie:
I don't know either.

44:48.561 --> 44:51.104
But I do know

44:51.272 --> 44:53.398
that you're welcome wherever I go.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.832
Is Mose invited to the new destination?

45:12.877 --> 45:16.546
Because I'd think you'd need
to widen some doorways if he is.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.007
Haven't talked to Mose about it.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.967
He can be the watchman then.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.428
I have no issue with that.

45:25.431 --> 45:28.100
We'll figure the rest out...

45:28.267 --> 45:30.685
when time comes.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.691
Where would the stage be?

45:36.859 --> 45:40.112
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know either.

45:40.279 --> 45:43.949
(chuckles)
Ain't our line, I guess.

45:48.496 --> 45:51.748
That they agreed tonight
is no guarantee

45:51.916 --> 45:54.751
what they'll do
at 10:00 in the morning.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.802
Please see that no harm
comes to that horse.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.140
I will.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.907
Then after the watches
were synchronized,

46:26.075 --> 46:28.910
another hour
studying them like idiots

46:29.078 --> 46:32.330
to see if one gained on the other.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.840
Sol.

46:49.682 --> 46:53.560
(sighs)
It's not the fucking hour.

46:55.938 --> 46:59.107
It's not fucking vantage of the chair.

46:59.275 --> 47:02.944
It's you that's changed the level
of your suction somehow.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.530
That's the fucking sum
and substance of it.

47:05.698 --> 47:07.282
Maybe if I get up on my knees?

47:07.450 --> 47:10.535
You're the cocksucker.
Change your fucking angle.

47:12.914 --> 47:16.166
Hey, Jesus Christ,
you'll turn me inside out.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.629
Come on.

47:20.796 --> 47:23.840
Advice from third fucking parties...

47:24.008 --> 47:27.010
place a table on the boardwalk,

47:27.178 --> 47:29.137
people can jot their suggestions,

47:29.305 --> 47:31.348
roll in the muck of the thoroughfare

47:31.516 --> 47:33.183
in gales of fucking laughter.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.143
I did not shame myself.

47:35.311 --> 47:38.146
I keep an open mind in that area.

47:38.314 --> 47:42.192
Kid yourself about your behavior,
you'll never learn a fucking thing.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.448
I knew what was coming too.

47:48.616 --> 47:52.786
Fucking captain, holding me down.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.373
I knew what the fuck was next.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.208
When he chopped off your finger?

47:58.376 --> 48:00.126
He didn't chop off my finger.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.754
Hearst chopped my fucking finger off!

48:02.922 --> 48:05.131
The other fuck held me down.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.425
They hold you down,
you-you can't get at them

48:07.593 --> 48:09.928
to help yourself.

48:10.096 --> 48:12.681
Fucking cold in here anyway, isn't it?

48:12.848 --> 48:15.725
- You want a blanket?
- If I do, I'll put it round me.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.186
You ain't boss
of the fucking bedclothes.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.692
They hold you down from behind,

48:23.859 --> 48:26.611
then you wonder why you're helpless.

48:26.779 --> 48:29.656
How the fuck could you not be?!

48:29.824 --> 48:31.283
I don't like it either.

48:31.450 --> 48:33.118
Another one that held me down,

48:33.286 --> 48:35.870
that fucking' proctor
when I tried to get to that ship.

48:36.038 --> 48:39.332
He fucking held me,
fucking wouldn't let me go.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.336
Fucking my mind, you see?
She was being restrained.

48:43.504 --> 48:46.881
Couldn't get back off that had
got on the boat to New Orleans

48:47.049 --> 48:50.051
to go suck prick in Georgia.
She changed her mind and--

48:50.219 --> 48:54.556
and I was being restrained by that
fat bastard orphanage proctor.

48:56.475 --> 48:58.518
Anyway, that's it.
That's the end of it.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.645
That's the fucking conclusion.

49:00.813 --> 49:03.607
Christ, I'd have wished to--

49:06.485 --> 49:09.487
Though probably she'd have
thrown me overboard anyway,

49:09.655 --> 49:12.115
but I'd have wished to get
to that fucking ship.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.659
But I was being restrained.

49:14.827 --> 49:18.204
I couldn't get from where she'd left me.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.457
He held me to that bed,

49:20.625 --> 49:24.210
her calling from the ship
that had changed her mind.

49:24.378 --> 49:26.171
I don't like it either.

49:26.339 --> 49:28.340
No, huh?

49:30.259 --> 49:33.094
What?

49:33.262 --> 49:35.180
When they hold you down.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.768
I guess I do that, huh,
with your fucking hair?

49:39.935 --> 49:41.269
No.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.605
No?

49:48.611 --> 49:51.112
Well, bless you for a fucking fibber.
