WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.042
Newcastle done.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.177
Cancun done.

00:11.244 --> 00:14.047
Australia, you're getting done.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.983
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:17.050 --> 00:19.986
And deep into the bush.
(all scream)

00:21.921 --> 00:24.324
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.527
This one's gonna be the best yet.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.598
This is a fucking war.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.735
The anger management woman is here
for one person only.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.304
Scott, your name has
come up most often.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.777
Scott's smashing the house up again.

00:43.843 --> 00:47.514
Scott's smashed another thing
when he's pissed, when will he learn?

00:48.748 --> 00:50.483
I am fucking tashing on.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.319
There are plenty tashing.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.322
Before I know,
I'm going in for the tash.

00:58.191 --> 01:01.394
I'm sowing me wild oats.
Go on, Vicky.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.465
I've done it!
I've tashed on with fit Dan!

01:07.267 --> 01:09.669
It's just familiar cock from now on.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.772
Gary still thinks he's got
some kind of power of us.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.576
Who wants to kiss Gary?
Fucking stupid prick.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.878
Go, go, go, go!

01:18.945 --> 01:22.549
Now go kiss someone else,
cos I'm happy to watch. I don't care.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.753
Once again we are too fucked
to even have sex.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.826
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.094
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.497
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.299
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.201
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.903
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.139
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.675
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:02.188 --> 02:04.157
Last night was mint,

02:04.224 --> 02:08.026
but yet again it ended
with Scotty T smashing something.

02:08.094 --> 02:11.231
If it's not a bird,
it's a wall or a piano.

02:11.998 --> 02:15.001
The way Scott keeps going on,
he's gonna get punished.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.971
Matter of time before
Steve turns up and bollocks him.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.642
I've found out that there is
a Newcastle in Australia.

02:22.709 --> 02:26.479
I wanna take everyone there
and see if it's as good as the Toon.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.519
I've never seen her so hungover.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.656
What the hell happened last night
and why was I in such a state?

02:36.723 --> 02:39.759
At one point I remember Joel
being drunk and thinking,

02:39.826 --> 02:44.898
"I wanna get drunker,"
and oh, my God, I fucking did that.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.933
(Vicky) Have a nice day.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.171
Only people left is
me, Charlotte and Gaz,

02:52.238 --> 02:54.607
which is gonna be really weird.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.357
It doesn't matter how many times
you tell Scott

03:11.424 --> 03:12.959
about what he's doing wrong

03:13.026 --> 03:15.895
cos it just goes in one ear
and out the fucking other.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.131
The kid thinks he's done nowt wrong.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.241
Yeah!
(laughter)

03:29.842 --> 03:32.412
Just seen the sign for
Mooney bridge.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.280
We go past Mooney Mooney bridge,

03:34.347 --> 03:37.817
which obviously means
you've got to get your crack out.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.619
Not what the Aussies meant.

03:39.686 --> 03:44.023
None of the others want to do it.
Why? They've got shit crack.

03:44.090 --> 03:48.328
So we're driving up
and we see the sign for Newcastle.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.097
It's mental, isn't it?
It's got Jesmond.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.032
Thinking of going home, like?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.238
It's fuckin' kinda nice,
this beach, like.

03:59.305 --> 04:02.609
If I didn't know any better
I'd think I was at Whitley Bay.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.144
Nice beach.
It's mint.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.584
Why would I ever want to go
to Newcastle in Australia

04:11.651 --> 04:13.786
when it's going to be a let down?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.788
It won't have any good kebab shops,

04:15.855 --> 04:18.124
people won't be wearing
false eyelashes

04:18.190 --> 04:19.726
and there won't be a Bijoux.

04:23.162 --> 04:25.999
Last thing I wanna do is
go to the gym and train

04:26.065 --> 04:29.602
but I need to get out of the house
to cure this hangover.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.204
Never been to the gym.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.908
The only work-out Sophie's gonna do
is with her mouth and her tongue

04:35.975 --> 04:38.044
and she will talk my ear off.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.547
So, so ill.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.384
Like, you don't understand
how ill I am.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.222
Last night was a night
I never thought I'd see,

04:49.288 --> 04:53.326
Charlotte with me, drinking,
on a party bus, pulling girls for us.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.995
Our whole friendship
was based on flirting.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.204
He's keep talking about Charlotte
and brings Mitch up all the time.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.807
You never hear Charlotte
talking about Gary.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.977
At work she was like,
"Who wants to neck on with Gaz?"

05:11.044 --> 05:14.681
What the fuck? She has me snogging
some girl in front of Charlotte.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.816
And she's not getting upset over it?

05:16.883 --> 05:19.419
If that's what it takes,
that's what it takes.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.255
I think Gary still likes Charlotte,

05:22.321 --> 05:24.757
but Charlotte hates him
and she's moved on.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.227
Do you think there'll be a period
where youse will be friends?

05:28.294 --> 05:31.397
We're still friends,
but friends properly, baby steps.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.503
(Holly) This is pretty.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.742
Shall we get some fish and chips?

05:42.809 --> 05:44.944
This fish and chips sucks cock.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.748
There's no fucking mushy peas,
there's no fucking chip shop curry,

05:48.815 --> 05:49.949
there's no gravy,

05:50.016 --> 05:52.685
but the only thing I fancy is
the lethal waiter.

05:56.956 --> 06:00.359
Vicky is on fucking heat.
She's cracking on with the fish man.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.495
Vicky!

06:05.598 --> 06:07.366
I'm so crap at this.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.302
I've been doing all right pulling

06:09.368 --> 06:11.604
but me game's
not what it used to be.

06:11.671 --> 06:14.107
Rather than be cool
and coy and collected,

06:14.173 --> 06:16.576
I panic because I think
he's gonna walk away

06:16.642 --> 06:20.279
and I won't get a chance to express
the fact I find him attractive.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.949
Are you single?
No, I'm not. Sorry. That's OK.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.650
Pied. (laughs)

06:24.717 --> 06:27.253
I've just been pied in
Newcastle, Australia.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.723
(blows raspberry) This would never
happen in Newcastle, UK.

06:31.624 --> 06:34.227
Mine and Joel's relationship
has come so far

06:34.293 --> 06:37.897
that not only do I like him,
I'm allowing him to be me wingman.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.298
I'm so out of practice.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.934
I didn't think
you were gonna go in so hard.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.604
Me and Vicky have gone in
different directions

06:44.670 --> 06:46.105
when it comes to pulling.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.842
She's all over the cock and I just
kind of shy away from it now.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.612
I'm a bit scared of it.
(laughter)

06:58.651 --> 07:01.020
So I get back from the gym with Gaz

07:01.087 --> 07:04.290
and I want to tell Charlotte
everything he's been saying

07:04.357 --> 07:06.492
because he's been
talking about Mitch

07:06.559 --> 07:09.896
and if anyone was talking about
Joel, I would want to know.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.597
So I'm gonna tell Charlotte.

07:13.032 --> 07:17.003
I was at the gym with Gaz and the
whole conversation was about you.

07:17.069 --> 07:20.173
I've moved on.
I moved on, like, five months ago.

07:20.239 --> 07:23.576
He said, "We're taking baby steps."
What does he mean?

07:23.643 --> 07:27.346
To be good friends again.
We're never gonna be good friends.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.817
I can't help but feel
really fucking pissed off

07:30.883 --> 07:33.419
when I hear Gary's been
talking about us.

07:33.486 --> 07:36.489
Next time he brings us up to anyone
I want people to say,

07:36.556 --> 07:38.724
"Why are you talking
about Charlotte?"

07:38.791 --> 07:40.426
"Stop it, you look pathetic."

07:40.493 --> 07:44.530
Even if it's good, good or bad,
I'm fucking pissed off.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.699
Why is he talking about us at all?

07:46.766 --> 07:50.403
I don't want you to be happy for us,
I don't want you to talk about us!

07:50.469 --> 07:52.238
Ugly twat.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.218
I'm buzzing for tonight, we're
all out and were hitting Trademark.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.686
Why-aye.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.424
(groans)

08:11.490 --> 08:13.726
So I'm drinking meself
into an oblivion.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.730
I can't bear to go out another night

08:17.797 --> 08:20.266
when I know that Vicky
is gonna be on the pull.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.935
I'm left by meself all the time.
I'm sick of it.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.706
I'm not gonna do anything

08:26.772 --> 08:30.209
cos trying to get in the way of
psycho Charlotte isn't an option.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.316
God, I'm in a drunken fit of rage.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.686
I'm so dangerous.
I'm showing everyone the danger.

08:40.753 --> 08:41.787
(yells)

08:45.424 --> 08:48.227
Step back, I may harm you!

08:48.294 --> 08:51.063
(laughter)

08:51.130 --> 08:54.800
What is it with this house?
We all just love smashing it up.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.904
A portrait of dysfunction.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.215
Joel and Soph have
decided to stay in

09:09.282 --> 09:11.884
and you can't blame 'em
for wanting alone time.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.520
The rest of wor are
heading to Trademark.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.328
I might be out
with singles tonight

09:22.395 --> 09:25.298
but it beats staying in
with psycho Charlotte

09:25.364 --> 09:28.067
and Sophie and Joel in
bondage gear.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.476
Holly has, from somewhere,
developed cock fright.

09:37.543 --> 09:41.681
I don't know where it came from
but we need to see the end of it.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.657
Holly doesn't seem herself.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.926
She's not bothered about
chasing cock.

09:53.993 --> 09:57.330
I don't know if either she knows
she can't compete with Vicky

09:57.396 --> 09:59.231
or Scott's just put her off it.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.485
Me and Joel have had
so much fun lately

10:19.552 --> 10:22.722
but now I think it's time
that we have sex, too.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.861
Was it?

10:28.928 --> 10:31.864
Really good, though.
Had such a good day.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.600
Me and Joel can't believe
how far we've came.

10:34.667 --> 10:39.739
From anal to bondage
to BJs behind the decks

10:39.805 --> 10:42.908
and now to having
a meal in Australia.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.045
I'm so happy.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.449
Oh, there she is.

10:50.516 --> 10:53.285
So, me and Joel are trying
to have a nice night in,

10:53.352 --> 10:56.689
spend a bit of time together
and Charlotte comes

10:56.756 --> 10:59.392
and is the third fucking wheel.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.098
Yeah, I know.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.600
I do get what she means.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.136
When all the girls are out
having a good time,

11:10.202 --> 11:13.039
the last thing we want to see
is one girl kissing boys.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.317
Me and the girls feel like
we're kind of losing Vicky,

11:25.384 --> 11:26.552
she's going crazy.

11:29.722 --> 11:33.426
We're getting confused.
We don't really know her any more.

11:45.104 --> 11:48.140
I see a girl from the other night
but she's got a friend.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.509
If I get her back,
I'll get her friend back.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.318
Holly's whinging
cos I've got two girls.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.154
Relax, I've had two girls before,
I can handle it.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.863
Scott and Gary completely lower
their standards in Australia.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.866
Most of the girls that they pull
are average at best.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.381
They can't keep treating this house
like a fucking hotel.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.585
You can't just keep bringing
these girls back

12:32.651 --> 12:35.321
and expecting us to be OK with it
all the time

12:35.387 --> 12:40.926
and bailing us just to go
and neck on with some girls.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.095
What?! I don't get it.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.144
Me and Holly are winding
each other up

12:58.210 --> 13:01.013
talking about how Scott is
treated unfairly.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.781
He's golden boy in this house

13:02.848 --> 13:06.085
and he's not getting any retribution
for his behaviour.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.762
Scott, being the oversized
man-child he is,

13:16.829 --> 13:18.898
is thinking with his cock again.

13:18.964 --> 13:19.965
He is fucked.

13:20.032 --> 13:23.469
He's pissed everyone off
and there's going to be retribution.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.947
(screaming)

13:35.014 --> 13:37.516
She wants destruction
and she's gonna get it.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.218
I fucking love this house.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.420
I love Australia
They kiss each other,

13:41.487 --> 13:44.256
playing with one, banging the other.
No chance.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.758
He's shitting himself.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.661
I can see it right in
his beady little fucking eyes.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.063
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:53.465 --> 13:53.666
.

13:56.202 --> 13:56.402
.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.980
I've had a shit night,

14:08.047 --> 14:11.584
I'm winding meself up thinking
how Scott gets away with murder.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.653
All I want is to have a bitch
and have a fucking pizza.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.225
Brought you some pizza.
But not Holly.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.328
Holly does not want
the Italian delicacy that is pizza,

14:22.394 --> 14:24.496
she wants destruction
and will get it.

14:24.563 --> 14:28.400
I'm fucking sick of people getting
fucking preferential treatment.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.904
This isn't about pizza, this is
about something much bigger.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.441
This is about equality and I'm gonna
stand up for what is right.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.810
(Holly screaming)

14:37.876 --> 14:39.945
Oh, my God!

14:40.012 --> 14:43.482
The girls are whinging again,
arguing, screaming, shouting,

14:43.549 --> 14:45.584
I don't care, their voices bore us.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.587
I'm sick of people getting
preferential treatment.

14:48.654 --> 14:53.525
Scott gets to bring girls back,
smash the fucking place four times,

14:53.592 --> 14:56.362
I get sent away for three days.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.498
Obviously the girls are all grown up
and all mature,

14:59.565 --> 15:02.668
when they kick off, give them
a pizza and a can of pop

15:02.735 --> 15:04.637
and send them to bed.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.305
(burps)

15:10.109 --> 15:13.345
I fucking love this house.
I love Australia.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.447
I'm going to bed
with these two girls.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.916
I'm playing with one,
banging the other.

15:17.983 --> 15:22.087
I don't understand why the girls
whinge so much, this is amazing.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.458
The only place left for me
and this bird to go is the sofa.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.828
As long as it's shark proof,
I couldn't give a fuck.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.278
Oi, oi. What's the craic?
Where's everyone else?

15:46.345 --> 15:50.015
Everyone's gone. Where?
Like, literally gone.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.517
To the beach?
No.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.520
Charlotte, Scott and Holly
have been kicked out.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.921
What for?

15:55.988 --> 15:58.524
Charlotte kicked off...
I don't know what...

15:58.590 --> 16:01.760
Charlotte kicked off because
she didn't want to go out.

16:01.827 --> 16:05.331
She was angry
and ended up smashing...

16:05.397 --> 16:08.067
Kicked out for that?
She smashed the photos off.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.536
I hope everyone else
is getting punished.

16:10.602 --> 16:13.172
I hope they're cleaning up poo,
shaving sheep

16:13.238 --> 16:15.841
and wiping each other's arses.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.244
Do you not think the girls done it
cos Scott gets away with it?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.781
They thought they would
but obviously not.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.050
Everyone has been saying for ages

16:25.117 --> 16:28.420
that Scott needs to get punished
for the way he's going on.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.524
but I don't think that Holly and
Charlotte expected to get punished.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.728
So it's just me, you, Vicky and Gaz?
Yeah.

16:35.794 --> 16:36.895
That's it?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.869
Nah, nah, nah.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.439
"Take your toothbrush"?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.242
Here, Soph.
Yeah?

16:50.309 --> 16:53.045
There's fucking no chance
I'm doing that. What?

16:53.112 --> 16:56.348
"Trip planned, the most
haunted house in Australia."

16:56.415 --> 16:59.818
I believe in ghosts,
I've seen so many ghosts in my life,

16:59.885 --> 17:03.222
but Vicky is a sceptic.
Stop being a big fanny, Gary.

17:03.288 --> 17:05.891
Honestly, I don't like.
It'll be a right laugh.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.560
What are they gonna do to you?
It's only a ghost.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.628
Do you believe in that?
I love that.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.170
Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!

17:18.237 --> 17:20.305
Do youse believe in it?
Do I fuck.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.940
Do you not?
Absolutely not.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.942
Think it's crap?
It's shite.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.145
Everyone's buzzing
cos we're going to

17:26.211 --> 17:28.347
"the most haunted house
in Australia"

17:28.414 --> 17:31.016
as opposed to going to
every other haunted house

17:31.083 --> 17:33.519
with the same fake shit
that doesn't exist!

17:36.588 --> 17:40.359
Fuck, can't see anything.
It's pitch black. Oh, my God.

17:41.293 --> 17:44.163
Just like, fields and stuff.
There, that's it.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.498
It looks like something
off a horror film.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.267
Oh, my God.

17:48.333 --> 17:52.538
So, we pull up to the haunted house.
It's dark, it's raining.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.474
Fuck me, this is scary.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.649
This room is probably the most calm
and collected room in the house.

18:03.715 --> 18:07.286
People come into this room
and no-one says they're freaked out.

18:07.352 --> 18:11.156
Sorry to interrupt
but something is going on me foot.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.424
Really?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.495
Oh, my God, is it just me?
Why is it just me?

18:16.562 --> 18:19.097
Something has just touched me
on the leg

18:19.164 --> 18:21.066
and I know for a fact
it was a ghost.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.169
It's this leg, something's going
like that on me foot.

18:24.236 --> 18:27.639
Feel how cold it is there.
It is actually cold.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.842
It was probably Gaz,
the creepy prick.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.743
He hasn't bucked in 15 minutes.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.014
The bedroom
we've put you in tonight

18:36.081 --> 18:38.217
is one we have
the most trouble with.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.321
I think we'll head inside and start
preparing for the night ahead.

18:44.323 --> 18:48.527
Vicky, get in the double with me.
I'll look after you.

18:48.594 --> 18:52.998
The room we've got to sleep in is
the most haunted in the whole house

18:53.065 --> 18:56.168
and I'm crapping meself cos
the bed we're sleeping on

18:56.235 --> 18:57.803
is where someone died.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.507
Ghosties, ghosties.
It's only a little bed.

19:01.573 --> 19:04.610
Who gives a fuck?
Same as every B&amp;B in Newcastle.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.057
I've been kicked out of
the house again.

19:19.124 --> 19:22.461
I'm in the punishment hotel.
I feel like it's me second home.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.264
I've spent more time here
than I have at the house.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.834
On the plus side, Scott's with us
as well. Finally some justice.

19:30.135 --> 19:33.038
This is shit.
Last night I was balls deep,

19:33.105 --> 19:35.841
and tonight I'm gonna have
a tug in this shit hotel.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.944
Steve must be really fucked off.
I wonder if this is it?

19:39.011 --> 19:41.346
I hope this is
the end of the punishment.

19:41.413 --> 19:42.814
I really don't want Steve

19:42.881 --> 19:45.250
to have something else shit
lined up for us.

19:45.317 --> 19:50.188
There's shit inside this room.
I feel claustrophobic.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.758
You've been jumping around
like a tit.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.359
Cos I'm bored, man.

19:54.426 --> 19:58.964
Scott is a ball of energy and can't
find anywhere to release it.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.534
He's locked in this room like
a caged animal bursting to get out.

20:03.402 --> 20:07.105
I wonder if Gary's pulling, Scott?
Fucking needs to, like.

20:07.172 --> 20:10.008
Do you reckon he's catching up
with you on the tally?

20:10.075 --> 20:13.145
He needs to cos if I'm not,
he better be.

20:13.211 --> 20:17.816
Keep up the fucking good work.
I need a break, pulled too much.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.020
Scott can deny he's not worried

20:22.087 --> 20:24.056
that Gary is catching up on him

20:24.122 --> 20:27.759
by bucking loads of people while
he's stuck in this motel with us.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.862
But he can't fool me and Holly,
he's shitting himself.

20:30.929 --> 20:33.365
I can see it right in
his beady fucking eyes.

20:35.601 --> 20:38.503
Be in a bit, it's too hot in there.
Bye.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.238
Nighties.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.478
Fuck.

20:47.813 --> 20:50.349
It's the middle of the night
and I'm wide awake

20:50.415 --> 20:53.619
and as I look up
I see all the bed posts shaking.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.320
I'm shitting meself.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.489
I felt the bed move before.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.293
Sophie wakes us up scared
in the middle of the night.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.462
Apparently she's seen something.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.897
There, there, Sophie,
don't worry about it.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.900
Aunty Vicky scared
all the crazy ghosts away,

21:08.967 --> 21:10.602
just you go back to sleep, pet.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.638
Fuck me.

21:17.709 --> 21:23.749
I've definitely got cock fright
and definitely lost my slag title

21:23.815 --> 21:25.851
and I'm really gutted about it.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.053
Holly's saying
she's got cock fright.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.122
It's not a fucking shot gun,
or is it?

21:30.188 --> 21:34.826
It's just a little play toy.
Little?

21:34.893 --> 21:38.330
For when I'm drunk.
(laughs)

21:38.397 --> 21:41.600
Cos we both know if we were sober,
we wouldn't do anything.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.904
Scott's the only familiar cock
I've got access to in Australia

21:45.971 --> 21:48.106
so when I'm mortal it's easier.

21:48.173 --> 21:50.308
Not very easily.

21:50.375 --> 21:55.847
Yeah, you were dead easy that night.
I was fucking ruined.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.116
You are starting to piss me off.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.786
When he's drunk,
he always puts his dick in her.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.657
Next thing I know I'm tashing on.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.893
(moaning)

22:09.761 --> 22:11.963
Gary doesn't know what a friend is.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.533
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:16.802 --> 22:17.002
.

22:19.504 --> 22:19.705
.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.617
So I wake up in the most
haunted house in Australia

22:32.684 --> 22:35.454
but I've had the best night's sleep
since I got here.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.523
I am so surprised
I wasn't scared of the haunted house.

22:38.590 --> 22:42.094
I think I'd get a bigger fright
if I saw the girls with no make-up.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.264
(yawns)

22:46.331 --> 22:47.733
I wake up fresh as a daisy.

22:47.799 --> 22:51.436
Of course I do, because there's
no such thing as fucking ghosts.

22:51.503 --> 22:55.373
I can't wait to just get home
and get pissed.

23:01.546 --> 23:05.817
Me, Holly and Scott, we're bored,
we're tired, sick of our lives

23:05.884 --> 23:08.320
and we wanna go back home
to see the others.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.056
Steve's such an arsehole.
I hate him.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.558
I hate him more than any boss
we've ever had.

23:13.625 --> 23:18.797
I'd rather suck Cancun Chris off
than be anywhere near Steve.

23:19.664 --> 23:23.535
Speak of the devil,
here he is walking in.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.437
God's sake.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.939
Youse are starting to piss me off.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.009
That's why you're on
this little fucking holiday camp

23:31.076 --> 23:33.445
and I hope you've had a nightmare.
It is.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.014
We're having to apologise to Steve

23:36.081 --> 23:38.817
and the only reason we are
is cos we want to go home.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.887
Sorry, mate.
Nah, it's e-fucking-nough.

23:41.953 --> 23:43.221
Sorry.

23:43.288 --> 23:47.425
But I don't want to apologise,
I feel weak, I feel dishevelled.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.694
Do you see the queen apologising?
No.

23:49.761 --> 23:53.698
The ute's out there, I want you
to go and do an errand for me.

23:53.765 --> 23:57.002
Oh, no, Steve!
Just get in the fucking truck.

23:57.068 --> 24:01.239
Don't carry on, I heard enough of
it with me fucking dog.

24:01.306 --> 24:04.442
I'm so thankful that Scott's
finally getting punished

24:04.509 --> 24:07.379
but not to the degree that
I have to go with him.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.548
Why has this happened and why me?

24:09.614 --> 24:13.084
Charlotte, you're going back to
the holiday camp.

24:13.151 --> 24:17.989
Yes! I get to go home and Holly
and Scott have to go on an errand.

24:18.056 --> 24:19.958
I don't even know what
one of them is

24:20.025 --> 24:24.763
but it sounds like a bad thing
what people never want to go on. Ha!

24:24.830 --> 24:26.665
I'll love youse and leave youse.

24:26.731 --> 24:31.403
Get the gear, clean up that room,
get yourselves into gear.

24:31.469 --> 24:34.506
Catch youse.
Good luck!

24:34.573 --> 24:37.042
I'm proper gutted.
Charlotte gets to go home

24:37.108 --> 24:40.645
while I've got to drive this shit
heap to the arse end of nowhere.

24:40.712 --> 24:44.816
Go to Hosey's Store, Hill End.
Where's Hill End?

24:44.883 --> 24:46.651
And give me a call.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.587
I'm sad to be leaving Holly.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.923
I very much doubt that
Scott and Holly are gonna have sex.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.859
I think maybe she'll suck him off

24:53.925 --> 24:56.294
but he's so thick
that when he's drunk,

24:56.361 --> 24:58.163
he always puts his dick in her.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.865
(Holly laughs)

25:00.999 --> 25:02.534
Scott, don't kill me!

25:09.074 --> 25:10.609
Hello!

25:15.814 --> 25:17.482
Where is everyone?

25:17.549 --> 25:19.384
God.
What's going on?

25:19.451 --> 25:22.454
Thank God Charlotte's back.
I'm absolutely buzzing.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.091
But she's not with Holly and Scott
and she's left them together.

25:26.157 --> 25:29.761
Is she thick? Holly's gonna
fall obsessed with Scott.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.730
I was allowed to come home.
Why?

25:31.796 --> 25:34.366
Steve just came out the hotel

25:34.432 --> 25:37.569
and was like, "Holly and Scott
need to go on an errand."

25:37.636 --> 25:39.604
Scott will fucking hate that.

25:39.671 --> 25:43.108
One, he's stuck with Holly and
that's the only bird he can bang

25:43.174 --> 25:46.077
and I'm in Sydney smashing it.
He will hate it.

25:46.144 --> 25:50.215
Shall we go out tonight
and celebrate you being back?

25:50.282 --> 25:53.251
Let's celebrate Scott
finally getting punished.

25:53.318 --> 25:57.055
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it, golden boy. Whoo!

25:59.424 --> 26:02.928
So we find out
it's six fucking hours away

26:02.994 --> 26:06.698
and I'm like, "I have to stay
over night." I can't be bothered.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.366
I'm fuming, me.

26:08.433 --> 26:12.237
While everyone's going out partying,
I've got to drive this shit ute

26:12.304 --> 26:15.840
with Barney the dinosaur as
a passenger to the middle of nowhere.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.143
You're worse than me
when you're drunk.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.546
I'm not. You were the one
who started it last time

26:21.613 --> 26:25.717
so don't fucking give me that, like.
Definitely not. You were.

26:30.889 --> 26:35.427
It's Tuesday, we're in Sydney,
it means one thing, World Bar.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.868
Don't get us wrong,
I do speak to James,

26:43.935 --> 26:46.638
We've just got different interests
at the minute.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.307
He loves bitching
and doing his hair,

26:49.374 --> 26:51.109
I love going out banging birds.

26:52.744 --> 26:55.413
Me, Gary and Sophie
used to be really close.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.848
Now that that's over,

26:56.915 --> 26:59.651
I feel Gary can't have
a friendship with a girl

26:59.718 --> 27:01.019
unless he's flirting.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.855
With Holly and Vicky,
it's very playful flirting

27:03.922 --> 27:07.158
and that's why
he classes them as friends.

27:07.225 --> 27:09.961
Gary doesn't know what a friend is.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.636
Scott's woke me up.
He's seen the sign for Hill End

27:18.703 --> 27:21.506
and I'm like,
"Whoa, I really don't like this."

27:21.573 --> 27:23.708
What the fuck's that?

27:25.543 --> 27:27.946
Scott hasn't pulled in
a couple of days

27:28.013 --> 27:31.049
and I'm thinking, well,
we haven't actually been drunk,

27:31.116 --> 27:33.718
it is just when we're drunk
we do things.

27:34.786 --> 27:37.722
We get to the B&amp;B,
there's nee-one here at all.

27:38.556 --> 27:41.059
Holly's booked the bridal suite.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.661
Just hoping I don't get too drunk

27:43.728 --> 27:46.798
cos I don't want to wake up
with Scott's dick in me mouth.

28:02.047 --> 28:05.583
Vicky out of nowhere challenges me
to a necking on competition.

28:05.650 --> 28:06.684
We're not 12.

28:06.751 --> 28:09.220
(both) Are you single?

28:09.287 --> 28:12.123
Come here.
Are you single? Come here.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.961
Come here! Quick!
(yelling)

28:19.864 --> 28:23.068
But next thing I know
I'm tashing on before him!

28:23.134 --> 28:25.003
I win! Swag.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.842
Before Gary even has a chance

28:30.909 --> 28:34.412
to lift his skinny little
acne-ridden face up,

28:34.479 --> 28:38.817
Vicky's already planting
her lips on some little boy. Yes!

28:38.883 --> 28:44.122
Gaz is devastated, he just lost
his crown for top puller to Vicky.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.757
What's he gonna do now?

28:52.197 --> 28:54.966
A real challenge,
let's see who bangs first.

28:57.836 --> 29:02.841
This is a very proud moment for me.
I am a weapon of tash destruction.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.042
Yes!

29:04.109 --> 29:08.179
What's crazy to think about,
this time last year Vicky was engaged

29:08.246 --> 29:10.982
and now she's racing me
to snog people in a club.

29:11.049 --> 29:14.185
(all chant) Gary! Gary!

29:14.252 --> 29:19.357
Yes, I lost, but I get five shots
and I might as well do them in style.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.359
Because Gary lost the pulling game,

29:21.426 --> 29:25.263
he's now taking it to himself
to pour tequila shots in his eyes.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.533
What the fuck? It's 2013.

29:30.235 --> 29:34.239
I think Vicky's going on a mad one
to prove to us she has moved on.

29:34.305 --> 29:37.775
We gathered the point after
the first 25 lads you snogged.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.385
What is it with everyone
wanting to challenge me?

29:47.452 --> 29:50.255
First Scott's competitive with birds,
now Vicky.

29:50.321 --> 29:52.757
Just let us be.
I've got things to attend to.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.568
(moaning)

30:05.303 --> 30:10.341
I heard a noise of a whale,
but it was Gary having sex.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.143
What the hell was going on?

30:12.210 --> 30:13.745
Gary, are you all right?

30:13.811 --> 30:16.047
I know Sophie hasn't got much action

30:16.114 --> 30:19.250
but I never thought she'd
listen to me bang for pleasure.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.920
(moaning)

30:21.986 --> 30:25.523
Banging away, I roll over forgetting
I've got a fractured hand,

30:25.590 --> 30:27.959
scream and Sophie's like,
"Gaz, are you OK?"

30:28.026 --> 30:30.428
I thought I heard you crying?

30:30.495 --> 30:35.166
Did he snap his banjo? It sounded
like he was in absolute pain.

30:35.233 --> 30:38.203
It sounded like a whale
getting done up the arsehole.

30:38.269 --> 30:40.905
(moaning)

30:41.839 --> 30:46.211
How's cock-a-tron?
What's the worst that could happen?

30:46.277 --> 30:49.047
Is he your new best friend
over Scott? (chuckles)

30:49.113 --> 30:52.984
I am the expert at knowing what
happens with friends with benefits.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.853
There won't be the chemistry
to end up banging.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.121
Are you for real?!

30:57.188 --> 30:59.691
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:01.960 --> 31:02.160
.

31:04.696 --> 31:04.896
.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.180
(laughs)

31:22.247 --> 31:25.850
So I've woken up and I'm just glad
I didn't go near Scotty T's cock.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.886
Me and Holly have still got
no idea why we're here.

31:28.953 --> 31:31.589
So we're gonna find a payphone
and ring Steve.

31:33.424 --> 31:35.059
Is that Steve?

31:35.126 --> 31:39.464
You've sent us all the way up here,
so tell us what you want us to do.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.367
He's telling me
he's too busy to speak to me.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.868
Are you for fucking real?

31:43.935 --> 31:47.171
Are you having a fucking laugh?

31:48.072 --> 31:50.775
I'm not calling you back
in a couple of hours.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.810
That's just ridiculous. Wanker.

31:54.312 --> 31:57.415
(laughs)
He's a fucking idiot!

31:57.482 --> 31:58.716
What's he done, like?

31:58.783 --> 32:01.185
He was like,
"I don't have time for this."

32:01.252 --> 32:07.058
See that? See the kangaroo?
Oh, my God.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.527
Why is it just laid there?
Shall I go and see?

32:09.594 --> 32:11.329
No, it will kill you.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.666
So, Scott spots a kangaroo
and he's going over to talk to it.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.167
He's like, "Come on, Roo."

32:16.234 --> 32:19.637
It's not a fucking dog.
Are you gonna go play with it?

32:19.704 --> 32:22.240
Make it your new friend
cos I don't wanna be it.

32:22.307 --> 32:25.176
If I wanna pull,
I've got a choice between a kangaroo,

32:25.243 --> 32:28.646
a stray dog or Holly. Tough choice.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.522
(doorbell rings)

32:37.588 --> 32:39.857
So, the doorbell rings
and I go to answer it

32:39.924 --> 32:42.327
expecting it to be Steve
or someone similar.

32:42.393 --> 32:45.363
Imagine my surprise when
it's Fit Dan from the gym

32:45.430 --> 32:49.000
accompanied by what can only be
described as a horse-size dog.

32:49.067 --> 32:52.003
What's his name?
King.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.605
Obviously.
I heard you like puppies.

32:54.672 --> 32:55.707
I do.

32:55.773 --> 32:58.042
I am completely taken by surprise.

32:58.109 --> 33:02.647
I wasn't sure if I was ever gonna
see him again and here he is.

33:02.714 --> 33:06.417
I can't help but think none of the
lasses the lads have brought back

33:06.484 --> 33:08.619
ever came back for more.
Take the lead.

33:08.686 --> 33:12.256
You'll take the piss out of me
cos I'm a girl. He just cruises.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.927
So we're going off on a little walk.
Me, Dan, his dog.

33:15.993 --> 33:19.497
We're like a little family.
When are you guys going out next?

33:19.564 --> 33:24.168
I think we're going to one of
your favourite places, Scary Canary.

33:24.235 --> 33:25.737
Oh, yeah.
(both giggle)

33:25.803 --> 33:29.240
Last time I must have been talking
his ear off cos I was so drunk.

33:29.307 --> 33:31.342
I didn't think
he had anything to say

33:31.409 --> 33:33.978
but this has showed
he's got a bit of banter.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.080
I'm proud of his little cags.

33:36.147 --> 33:39.851
They're his, not yours,
why are you so proud?

33:39.917 --> 33:41.486
Because they're so big.

33:41.552 --> 33:45.089
I feel like you should cover
his modesty or something.

33:45.156 --> 33:46.824
Give him a pair of knickers.

33:46.891 --> 33:52.263
The topic of conversation that comes
to my head first is dogs' bollocks.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.866
Wicked(!)
I'll be in touch.

33:54.932 --> 33:57.535
We'll go have a drink or something.
Definitely.

33:57.602 --> 33:58.603
See you soon.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.972
I don't even
want to think about the date.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.174
I'm gonna be a complete basket case.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.611
Everything from what I'm gonna wear,
how I'm doing me hair,

34:06.677 --> 34:09.614
what size heels to wear.
I'm going to be a nervous wreck.

34:21.525 --> 34:24.762
One thing I knew I was gonna do
in Australia is learn to surf.

34:24.829 --> 34:28.331
I'm a good swimmer but surfing is
a different ball game.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.936
James, on the other hand, has only
just got his ten metre badge.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.304
How the fuck is he going to surf?

34:36.574 --> 34:39.010
Howay then,
me and Gaz are off surfing.

34:39.076 --> 34:41.078
What's the worst that could happen?

34:48.853 --> 34:53.024
Fucking hell. I feel mint
after that, it's woke us right up.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.926
I want to be better than Scott.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.856
If Scott bangs Holly
he's gonna be treading on thin ice.

35:24.922 --> 35:29.427
I am the expert at knowing what
happens with friends with benefits.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.503
Finally, one thing that
me and Gaz agree on

35:38.569 --> 35:40.838
is that you can't have
uncomplicated sex

35:40.905 --> 35:43.040
with someone
that lives in this house.

35:43.107 --> 35:44.775
If Scott and Holly are banging

35:44.842 --> 35:47.144
it's a matter of time
before it kicks off.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.680
Let's go get some food and go out.

35:58.456 --> 36:03.127
Do you miss Scott?
It's just quieter. (laughs)

36:03.194 --> 36:07.899
Everyone's agreeing the house is
so much better without Scott here.

36:07.965 --> 36:11.369
Even Gaz is starting to grow on us
without his wingman.

36:11.435 --> 36:14.238
Me and James both paddled,
both stood up

36:14.305 --> 36:17.174
and we hit into the board
and were like, "High five!"

36:17.241 --> 36:18.376
It looked mint.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.979
Without Scott around,
Gary and James can be friends.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.815
They get along,
they make conversation,

36:24.882 --> 36:27.084
they make time of day
for each other.

36:27.151 --> 36:29.253
No-one feels like
anyone is left out.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.490
Is he your new best friend
over Scott?

36:32.557 --> 36:33.891
I wouldn't say that.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.827
This house is such
a better house without Scott.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.897
There's no dramas,
no-one doing your head in.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.133
Everyone is getting on with life.

36:42.199 --> 36:45.202
Our group changed massively
when Scott came in, like.

36:45.269 --> 36:47.171
I think from that moment...

36:47.238 --> 36:49.340
He's a nice lad and that,

36:49.407 --> 36:53.377
but they just need to forget about
all this competition stuff.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.747
When Scott's not around
there's a different dynamic.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.816
It's as though without his wingman,

36:58.883 --> 37:02.286
Gary is more able to connect with us
and communicate

37:02.353 --> 37:04.722
and spends less time
trying to pull birds.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.825
I haven't got a voice in my ear
asking me what I'm doing.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.828
It's quieter for you.
No difference for us.

37:15.366 --> 37:18.402
Hiya, Steve.
What Steve's craic?

37:18.469 --> 37:22.373
I've been punished enough.
Hello, it's Holly. Bell-end.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.241
Hill End? More like "dead end".

37:24.308 --> 37:28.846
I'm great, Steve.
We're having a bloody lovely time.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.383
So I'm on the phone to Steve
and I'm really drunk by this point

37:32.450 --> 37:34.585
and I'm actually being really nice.

37:34.652 --> 37:38.089
What have you been up to, Steve?
Have you been having a good time?

37:38.155 --> 37:39.890
He's not really having any of it

37:39.957 --> 37:42.259
but he tells us
we can go home tomorrow

37:42.326 --> 37:45.863
cos we're too pissed to continue
with the journey. Result.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.900
Steve said he was going
to send us to Wellington.

37:49.967 --> 37:53.304
I said, "Where's Wellington?"
He said, "It doesn't matter,

37:53.371 --> 37:56.907
just sleep off your hangovers
and come back in the morning."

37:56.974 --> 38:00.811
As long as I can survive one night
without getting eaten alive by Holly

38:00.878 --> 38:02.947
it's sound.
Let's just get drunk.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.359
We're going to Scary Canary.

38:15.426 --> 38:18.129
Me and Sophie will get so drunk
we piss ourselves,

38:18.195 --> 38:19.597
just like the old days.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.944
I'm buzzing that I can
let me hair down, get mortal

38:34.011 --> 38:36.647
and finally get a shag
at the end of the night.

38:48.626 --> 38:52.163
What's crazy to think about,
I'm in a club talking about tactics

38:52.229 --> 38:54.365
and standards and pulling with Vicky,

38:54.432 --> 38:57.134
when not long ago I bought rings
for her with Ricci.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.548
So what?
I'm making up for fucking lost time.

39:10.614 --> 39:12.850
I've been in a relationship
for two years

39:12.917 --> 39:15.352
when I wasn't allowed to look
at another lad.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.159
(giggling)

39:23.828 --> 39:27.865
It's sensual.
Knee massage is meant to be sensual.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.802
Supposed to be relaxing, man.
(giggles)

39:31.869 --> 39:35.239
So I'm getting drunker
and drunker and drunker

39:35.306 --> 39:38.209
and flirtier and flirtier
and more touchy.

39:38.275 --> 39:43.047
How's cock-a-tron?
(laughs nervously)

39:43.114 --> 39:45.683
He's wicked.
Good.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.384
(both laugh)

39:47.451 --> 39:51.622
This always happens when we
get drunk and are alone together.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.992
Something will happen,
there is no-one else to distract me.

40:11.876 --> 40:15.813
We've all been thinking lately that
Vicky has been tashing on too much.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.816
She's been taking herself away
from the group to pull

40:18.883 --> 40:20.451
and that's been by herself.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.290
Hang on a second.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.360
Charlotte, co-founder
of the cock capturers,

40:29.426 --> 40:34.498
and Gary, self-professed possessor
of a degree in pulling women,

40:34.565 --> 40:37.401
thinks I need to slow down
on the tashing on?

40:37.468 --> 40:41.305
Fucking hypocrites!
I can't even believe me ears.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.412
I'm only trying to have
a bit of banter with Vicky

40:48.479 --> 40:50.548
about her tashing on
and she kicks off.

40:57.521 --> 41:02.827
Turns out both Charlotte and Gaz
has spoken to her about tashing on.

41:16.473 --> 41:19.510
I think it's safe to say now
my night's ruined.

41:24.114 --> 41:26.851
Me and Scott now are really drunk

41:26.917 --> 41:30.387
and it's really like,
tipsy, tired, flirty drunk

41:30.454 --> 41:32.623
and it's just going
a little bit too far.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.429
So Holly's moving into me chod and
I'm too pissed to put up a fight.

41:38.495 --> 41:40.664
Go on then, suck away.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.568
So we're drunk and we're in bed

41:44.635 --> 41:49.073
and Scott's cock accidentally falls
into my mouth and I'm sucking it.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.081
I'm starving.

41:57.147 --> 41:58.482
In Geordie Shore style,

41:58.549 --> 42:01.485
we get back to the house
and everything's forgotten.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.821
Look what I found. (yells)

42:03.888 --> 42:05.789
We eat pizza, we get a bit drunker,

42:05.856 --> 42:08.325
I'm never gonna hold this
against anyone.

42:08.392 --> 42:11.161
They had their opinion,
but I'll never forget it.

42:11.228 --> 42:13.864
No, you're fucking things up.

42:20.404 --> 42:23.507
If I got back and Mitch didn't want
to see us any more,

42:23.574 --> 42:25.442
Australia would be a big regret.

42:25.509 --> 42:28.178
I had a chance to move on
and be happy with someone

42:28.245 --> 42:32.483
but instead I came to Australia
to live with someone who I hate.

42:35.085 --> 42:37.655
It's the end of the night,
we're both drunk,

42:37.721 --> 42:41.325
and finally we can have
sexual intercourse.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.361
(laughs)

42:48.632 --> 42:51.869
(laughs)

42:52.269 --> 42:55.506
Urgh!
(laughs)

42:57.841 --> 43:01.578
Dolphin's got a massive blowhole.
Gary, stop trying to touch her.

43:01.645 --> 43:04.214
You had your chance, you blew it.

43:04.281 --> 43:07.318
(both) Oh, my God.

43:07.384 --> 43:09.186
(tearfully) I am your friend.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.956
One of the nicest moments
me and Gary have shared.

43:13.924 --> 43:17.428
I don't know who the fuck
the kid thinks he is.

43:18.228 --> 43:19.863
We're having a good time.

43:21.999 --> 43:26.170
It's total bullshit.
I'm not gonna let you back in yet.

43:51.095 --> 43:51.295
.
