WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.670
<i>PAPI,</i> I'M COMING HOME
RIGHT NOW. I PROMISE.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.506
(Ignacio)
Well, don't blame me

00:05.506 --> 00:08.842
IF YOUR ARROZ CON POLLO IS DRY.
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE REHEATED.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.553
I'm sure it will still
be delicious.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.555
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
LOVE YOU. BYE.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.645
AAH!

00:23.273 --> 00:27.194
UH, SORRY. SORRY, SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.529
W‐‐THAT'S OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.865
I‐I JUST CAME BY TO SAY,
I REALLY LIKED YOUR PITCH

00:31.865 --> 00:34.368
FOR A "GREEN" ISSUE.
WILHELMINA WAS WRONG.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.745
IT DID NOT
"REEK OF RECYCLED MANURE."
(chuckles)

00:36.745 --> 00:39.706
THANK YOU. AND I‐I REALLY
LIKED YOUR "GET SPORTY" IDEA.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.959
YOU WERE NOT
"NOTHING BUT NOSE HAIR"

00:41.959 --> 00:44.878
WHILE YOU WERE
PITCHING IT.
(laughs)

00:44.878 --> 00:46.088
(chuckles)

00:46.088 --> 00:48.340
AND I'VE ALSO
BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU,

00:48.340 --> 00:52.010
I'M REALLY
DIGGING YOUR NEW LOOK.
OH, THANKS.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.849
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.018
<i>(romantic music plays)</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:01.853
<i>(music warbles and fades)</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:04.773
YOUR HAIR WAS CAUGHT.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.775
THANK YOU.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.986
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.988
YOU, TOO.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.243
(camera shutter clicks)

01:16.243 --> 01:18.829
<i>HEY,</i> I THOUGHT
WE WERE LEAVING TOGETHER.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.832
OH, MARC, YOU CAN'T HONESTLY
BE ASKING ME TO STAY ANY LATER.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.793
I'M EXHAUSTED. I'VE BEEN WORKING
SINCE 9:00 A. M. WITHOUT A BREAK.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.379
AND BY "WORKING," DO YOU MEAN
"GOSSIPING" AND "COMPLAINING"?

01:27.379 --> 01:30.757
HEY, <i>MANDY‐LICIOUS.</i>
(gasps)
HEY, <i>MATTY‐LICIOUS.</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:32.134
(choking)

01:32.134 --> 01:34.595
ARE YOU OKAY, MARC?
OH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.472
I JUST GOT A PIECE OF CORNY
STUCK IN MY THROAT.
AMANDA, LISTEN.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.766
WILHELMINA THINKS THAT SOME OF
THE "REAL" PEOPLE WE SHOT

01:39.766 --> 01:42.394
FOR THE "REAL PEOPLE" COLUMN
WERE A LITTLE TOO "REAL."
(mouths words)

01:42.394 --> 01:44.771
SO I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND STAYING

01:44.771 --> 01:47.107
JUST FOR A BIT, JUST TO
GO OVER SOME PICTURES.
(gasps) ABSOLUTELY.
NO PROBLEM.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.610
I LOVE STAYING LATE.
(chuckles)

01:52.696 --> 01:55.365
<i>SOMEBODY'S</i> IN A RUSH
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.367
OH, I'M JUST
TRYING TO AVOID HARTLEY.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.953
PLUS, I WANTED TO MEET NATALIE
FOR THIS WHOLE GROUP MEETING.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.706
OH, YEAH.
HOW IS THAT GOING?
GOOD, ACTUALLY.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.167
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY HELPING ME
DEAL WITH LOSING MOLLY.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.086
THAT'S GREAT.
BY THE WAY, I'VE NOTICED
YOU AND MATT HAVE BEEN

02:08.086 --> 02:10.088
A LITTLE CHUMMY LATELY.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.090
ANYTHING
YOU'D CARE TO REPORT?

02:12.090 --> 02:14.134
UM, NO.
NOT AT THE MOMENT.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.762
BUT MAYBE I'LL HAVE
SOME NEWS FOR YOU

02:16.762 --> 02:18.930
BY THE TIME WE HAVE
OUR LUNCH TOMORROW.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.641
THAT'S RIGHT. UH...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.769
OUR FIRST EVER NON‐PROFESSIONAL,
JUST FRIENDS LUNCH.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.813
FIRST THING TOMORROW, I'M GONNA
HELP YOU GO THROUGH YOUR RéSUMéS

02:26.813 --> 02:28.690
TO FIND A NEW ASSISTANT,
BECAUSE CLEARLY, YOU FORGOT

02:28.690 --> 02:31.985
THAT WE EVEN HAD A LUNCH.
BETTY, HOW COULD
I EVER REPLACE YOU?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.363
(elevator bell dings)

02:34.363 --> 02:37.824
WELL,
WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.534
WAIT, UH, WILHELMINA?

02:39.534 --> 02:41.536
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH

02:41.536 --> 02:43.830
I RESPECT ALL THE WORK
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN TIBET.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.874
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL
COUNTRY TO ME

02:45.874 --> 02:48.335
BECAUSE IT WAS VERY CLOSE
TO MOLLY'S HEART,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.337
SO THANK YOU.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.470
(elevator bell dings)

03:02.808 --> 03:05.477
WHY THE HELL WAS
PASTY‐FACE HUGGING ME

03:05.477 --> 03:08.063
AND MUMBLING
SOMETHING ABOUT TIBET?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.691
OH, UM, THAT MIGHT...

03:10.691 --> 03:11.858
(thud)

03:11.858 --> 03:15.529
BE BECAUSE
YOU'RE BEING HONORED

03:15.529 --> 03:18.031
AT THE ANNUAL
"STYLE CARES" CHARITY EVENT.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.700
WHY?
UH, BECAUSE‐‐

03:19.700 --> 03:22.035
(thud)
YOU‐‐MM‐‐
YOU GIVE A LOT OF MONEY

03:22.035 --> 03:23.954
TO ORPHANS IN TIBET.
WHEN?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.747
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.
HOW?

03:25.747 --> 03:28.708
UH, THROUGH, A TAX‐DEDUCTIBLE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION

03:28.708 --> 03:31.002
SET UP BY YOUR ACCOUNTANT
AND SOMEONE.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.754
WHO?
ME.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.507
BUT I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE
YOUR ACCOUNTANT TOLD ME TO.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.593
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TRAIPSE ACROSS TOWN

03:38.593 --> 03:41.179
TO SOME TIRED OLD BALLROOM FOR
THE EVENT BECAUSE THE HONOREE

03:41.179 --> 03:44.599
ALWAYS HOSTS THE EVENT
IN THEIR OWN HOME...
(inhales sharply)

03:44.599 --> 03:48.728
SO THAT MORE MONEY
CAN GO TO THE ORPHANS.
AND WHEN, EXACTLY,

03:48.728 --> 03:51.898
WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT ALL OF THIS?
THE DAY BEFORE THE EVENT,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.401
SO YOU'D HAVE
LESS TIME TO HIT ME.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.403
THINK OF
THE TINY BABY ORPHANS...

03:56.403 --> 03:57.988
AND YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.743
I SUPPOSE YOU DO MAKE A GOOD
POINT ABOUT MY PUBLIC IMAGE.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.414
BUT WHO THE HELL WOULD GET
EXCITED ABOUT A CHARITY EVENT?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.791
I'VE BEEN INVITED
TO A CHARITY EVENT!

04:09.791 --> 04:11.543
AND IT'S AT WILHELMINA'S.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.545
(gasps)
AT WILHELMINA'S APARTMENT?

04:13.545 --> 04:16.214
HOW EXCLUSIVE!
CAN YOU STEAL ME SOMETHING‐‐

04:16.214 --> 04:19.926
LIKE A NAPKIN,
AN OLIVE, ANYTHING?
OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT YOU.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.429
LAST YEAR, YOU HAD TO
STEAL A DRESS TO GET IN.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.055
NOW YOU'RE
TOTALLY LEGIT.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.558
WELL, BEING AN EDITOR
HAS ITS PERKS.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.894
WELL, GETTING YOUR DINNER
AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE

04:28.894 --> 04:32.105
CERTAINLY ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
SORRY. I'M MAKING THIS ABOUT ME.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.108
OOH! SO... WHO'S GONNA BE
YOUR PLUS ONE?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.319
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

04:37.319 --> 04:40.614
I MEAN, MAYBE, I'LL...
INVITE MATT.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.990
OH.
WOW.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.617
WHAT?!
ARE YOU CRAZY?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.285
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAS HAPPENED?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.621
HILDA, COME ON.
I KNOW WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE,

04:47.621 --> 04:50.457
BUT THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING
REALLY WELL BETWEEN US.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.918
AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS
STILL SOMETHING THERE.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.505
AND WHAT BETTER PLACE TO
START OVER THAN A PARTY, HUH?

04:56.505 --> 04:59.925
WOW. I MEAN, THAT WAS‐‐
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!

04:59.925 --> 05:03.136
DURING THAT LAST FOCUS EXERCISE,
I GOT TO THIS PLACE OF...

05:03.136 --> 05:05.680
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT. IT WAS...

05:05.680 --> 05:07.641
I KNOW.
IT‐‐IT WAS SO PEACEFUL!

05:07.641 --> 05:10.018
I KNOW.
I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.646
IT'S LIKE I FEEL
CLOSER TO ROBBIE THAN EVER.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.148
GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM
SAYING ALL THIS.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.193
I WAS SUCH A SOUR BITCH
BEFORE YOU KNEW ME.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.403
WAIT, UM, "BEFORE"?

05:20.403 --> 05:21.822
(clicks tongue)
(chuckles)

05:21.822 --> 05:24.407
HEY.
OH, YOU KNOW
WHAT REALLY SUCKS?

05:24.407 --> 05:27.244
ONCE I GET BACK TO WORK,
ALL THIS STRESS STARTS

05:27.244 --> 05:29.663
COMING IN FROM ALL SIDES,
AND I JUST...

05:29.663 --> 05:32.207
I LOSE THIS GREAT FEELING
I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.583
OH, HEY.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.169
YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER NEED
ANY HELP

05:36.169 --> 05:40.465
OR GUIDANCE OR WHATEVER...

05:40.465 --> 05:42.050
I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.969
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

05:43.969 --> 05:47.138
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
HIRE YOU AS MY PERSONAL GURU.
OH, PLEASE!

05:47.138 --> 05:50.517
I COULD
REALLY USE THE MONEY.
(laughs)

05:50.517 --> 05:52.519
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.355
I‐I JUST HAD A CRAZY THOUGHT.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.007
HEY.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.091
HEY.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.885
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.013
ACTUALLY... THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU

06:28.013 --> 06:30.390
ABOUT WILHELMINA'S PARTY.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.017
REALLY?

06:32.017 --> 06:34.019
AND LET‐‐LET ME PREFACE
MY QUESTION BY SAYING

06:34.019 --> 06:36.021
YOU <i>REALLY</i> DON'T
HAVE TO SAY YES.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.107
IN FACT, I'D BE PERFECTLY FINE
IF YOU SAID NO,

06:39.107 --> 06:42.444
BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY EVEN SURE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
MATT, I'M SURE
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.571
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
WOULD YOU BE OKAY...
YES.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.324
IF I BROUGHT A DATE?

06:47.324 --> 06:51.328
YES. OF COURSE.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.079
THAT'S... GREAT THAT Y‐‐

06:53.079 --> 06:55.915
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE OKAY
FOR YOU TO BRING A DATE?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.710
THAT'S GREAT.
COOL, COOL. UM...

06:58.710 --> 07:01.463
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL PROBABLY
BE BRINGING SOMEONE, TOO.
YEP.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.381
GREAT.
YEP. YES,
I'M BRINGING SOMEONE.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.383
SO... SO...

07:05.383 --> 07:08.428
NOW IT WON'T BE AWKWARD
FOR EITHER ONE OF US,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.805
UH, TO SEE THE OTHER ONE
WITH ANOTHER PERSON,

07:10.805 --> 07:12.932
'CAUSE WE'LL BOTH BE THERE
WITH OTHER PEOPLE. YAY.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.268
(chuckles)

07:15.268 --> 07:18.313
HEY, LOOK! THERE'S, UH,
KATIE FROM SALES.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.483
YEP, THERE SHE IS.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.028
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE SO COOL
WITH THE WHOLE DATE THING.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.197
OH, YEAH.
NO, I'M COOL WITH IT.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.200
I'M MORE THAN COOL WITH IT.
I'M FREEZING WITH IT. (chuckles)

07:30.200 --> 07:31.284
BRR!

07:31.284 --> 07:33.953
(Hilda) Please tell me
you did not say that!

07:33.953 --> 07:36.956
WELL, WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?
You shouldn't have
said anything.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.417
YOU SHOULD'VE DECKED HIM.
Hilda, you were right.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.295
I DON'T KNOW WHY I KEEP HOPING
THAT THINGS ARE GONNA WORK OUT

07:42.295 --> 07:45.632
BETWEEN ME AND MATT.
I'M SO STUPID!
You are not stupid, okay?

07:45.632 --> 07:48.593
YOU WERE JUST FOLLOWING
YOUR STUPID HEART.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.595
I KNOW IT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.598
IT'S JUST, I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL REPLACED.
That is not true!

07:53.598 --> 07:55.600
YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND,
BETTY SUAREZ,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.519
AND DON'T YOU EVER FORGET IT.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.189
NOBODY COULD EVER
REPLACE YOU, OKAY?
OKAY. LOOK, I GOTTA GO.
I'M MEETING DANIEL. BYE.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.357
(cell phone beeps)

08:02.357 --> 08:05.026
HEY.
BETTY, HEY.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.403
I FINALLY REPLACED YOU.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.030
MEET NATALIE,
MY NEW ASSISTANT.

08:13.493 --> 08:19.499
♪♪♪

08:27.632 --> 08:29.634
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

08:29.634 --> 08:31.636
TO HIRE SOMEONE YOU MET
IN GRIEF COUNSELING?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.221
I MEAN, DOESN'T SHE KNOW

08:33.221 --> 08:35.223
ALL SORTS
OF PERSONAL THINGS ABOUT YOU?

08:35.223 --> 08:37.225
WON'T THAT BE KIND OF WEIRD?
ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF GREAT.

08:37.225 --> 08:41.020
I'M SUPER COMFORTABLE WITH HER
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS ME SO WELL.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.691
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
I FOUND ANOTHER YOU, BETTY.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.776
WELL...
(chuckles)

08:46.776 --> 08:49.195
WHAT KIND OF OFFICE
EXPERIENCE DOES SHE HAVE?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.197
DIDN'T YOU SAY SHE WAS
A‐A MASSAGE THERAPIST?

08:51.197 --> 08:54.200
TURNS OUT THAT REQUIRES A LOT
MORE PAPERWORK THAN YOU'D THINK.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.245
PLUS, SHE'S SO EXCITED
TO BE HERE.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.790
I MEAN, SHE GOT A NEW HAIRCUT
AND EVERYTHING.
OH, YOU <i>DID</i> NOTICE.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.169
I DID. IT LOOKS GREAT.
THANKS. CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THESE PHONES?

09:04.169 --> 09:06.337
I JUST PRESSED
THIS BUTTON,

09:06.337 --> 09:09.507
AND THERE WAS
A REALLY LOUD SQUEAK.
UH, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.343
BETTY, CAN YOU GIVE HER
A QUICK ORIENTATION?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.763
DO YOU MIND?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.017
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.685
(zipper zips)

09:20.685 --> 09:22.020
(gasps and whispers) OH!

09:22.020 --> 09:24.564
(Matt) WOW. YOU'D
BE A KNOCKOUT IN THAT.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.775
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING
TO WILHELMINA'S PARTY?

09:26.775 --> 09:28.777
(normal voice) NO.
SOME DUMB EDITOR IS,

09:28.777 --> 09:32.072
BECAUSE ONLY DUMB EDITORS
GET TO GO TO THE PARTY.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
NOT THAT I WANT TO GO TO
A DUMB EDITOR PARTY ANYWAY.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.493
IT'S SO DUMB.
OH, REALLY?
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD

09:36.493 --> 09:39.746
BECAUSE I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU.
BUT IF YOU THINK IT'S DUMB‐‐
DUMB? WHO SAID IT WAS DUMB?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.748
NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.
HANGING OUT WITH

09:41.748 --> 09:43.750
A BUNCH OF EDITORS‐‐
IT SOUNDS BORING.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.753
BUT IT WOULD AT LEAST BE FUN
IF YOU WERE THERE.
IT WOULD?

09:46.753 --> 09:51.091
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I HAVE TO CHECK
MY CALENDAR.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.551
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
I'M FREE. WHAT TIME?
(laughs)

09:53.551 --> 09:56.304
WELL, I HAVE TO COME STRAIGHT
FROM A MEETING, SO I'LL BE LATE,

09:56.304 --> 09:59.057
BUT YOU COME WHENEVER YOU WANT,
AND FIND ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.475
OKAY.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.560
(Marc) WHAT? YOU'RE GOING
WITH BETTY'S MATT?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.605
ISN'T THAT GOING TO BREAK
HER PUDGY LITTLE HEART?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.526
MARC, IT'S JUST THAT MATT
MAKES ME FEEL SMART <i>AND</i> PRETTY.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.529
CAN'T YOU JUST BE
HAPPY FOR ME?
I'M SORRY.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.532
IT'S JUST THAT I ASSUMED YOUR
ATTRACTION FOR BABY <i>FARTLEY</i>

10:15.532 --> 10:17.951
STARTED AND ENDED WITH
HIS MONEY‐FILLED POCKETS,

10:17.951 --> 10:20.537
BUT NOW I SEE
YOU ACTUALLY LIKE THIS GUY.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.955
I DO.
AW!

10:21.955 --> 10:24.541
I CAN'T HELP IT.
HE COMPLETES ME.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.460
OH, MANDY!
YOU'RE HAVING REAL FEELINGS!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.088
(laughs)
NOW I AM HAPPY FOR YOU!

10:30.088 --> 10:31.464
OH!
(laughing)

10:31.464 --> 10:33.466
DON'T BE HAPPY FOR ME.
OH.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.469
I'M GONNA BREAK
BETTY'S PUDGY LITTLE HEART.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.097
I HATE FEELINGS.
WELL...

10:39.097 --> 10:42.100
MARC, WHEN DID I
GET SO DEEP?
I DON'T KNOW.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.103
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
NOT GO TO THE PARTY WITH MATT?

10:45.103 --> 10:48.064
THAT WOULD BE
THE SELFLESS THING TO DO.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.482
(both laughing)

10:49.482 --> 10:52.068
NO, SERIOUSLY. YOU CAN EITHER
TELL BETTY THE TRUTH,

10:52.068 --> 10:53.528
PRAY SHE DOESN'T SHOW UP,

10:53.528 --> 10:56.531
OR, YOU KNOW, FIND SOME WAY
OF CUSHIONING THE BLOW.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.074
(laughs)

10:58.074 --> 11:01.494
NO, THOSE REALLY ARE
YOUR OPTIONS.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.663
(man) SO IN ORDER TO WRITE
YOUR SPEECH FOR TOMORROW,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.249
I JUST NEED TO GET
A FEEL FOR WHO YOU ARE.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.460
FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT INSPIRED YOU
TO HELP TIBETAN ORPHANS?

11:09.460 --> 11:12.463
MARC!
MANY YEARS AGO,
MS. SLATER EMBARKED ON

11:12.463 --> 11:17.468
A SOUL‐SEARCHING PILGRIMAGE
TO THE TINY VILLAGE OF TAWANG,

11:17.468 --> 11:19.304
HIGH IN THE HIMALAYAS.

11:19.304 --> 11:23.516
IT WAS HERE THAT SHE
EXPERIENCED A HOLY VISION,

11:23.516 --> 11:26.019
WHICH BROUGHT HER TO
THIS ORGANIZATION,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.896
AND ULTIMATELY...

11:27.896 --> 11:30.190
HER LIFE'S MISSION.
(telephone rings)

11:30.190 --> 11:32.233
NOW HOLY V‐‐
BUP, BUP!

11:32.233 --> 11:35.737
WILHELMINA SLATER'S OFFICE.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.864
UH, Y‐‐UH,
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.867
IT'S NICO.
SHE SOUNDS UPSET.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.786
MM.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.372
DARLING, WHAT'S WRONG?
SHH.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.168
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.502
(clears throat)

11:51.502 --> 11:54.005
WILLIE, YOU'RE COMING BACK,
RIGHT? WILLIE?

11:54.005 --> 11:56.758
YOU'VE GOT WHAT YOU NEED,
RIGHT?

11:56.758 --> 11:59.928
ALL RIGHTY. UH, I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO CHECK THE MESSAGES.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.430
(keypad beeps)
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Betty Suarez,</i>

12:02.430 --> 12:04.682
<i>assistant to Daniel Meade,</i>
<i>Editor‐In‐Chief‐‐</i>

12:04.682 --> 12:06.768
(telephone beeps)
<i>(electronic male voice)</i>
<i>Greeting deleted.</i>

12:06.768 --> 12:09.771
NOW HOW DO I DO
A NEW ONE WITH MY VOICE?

12:09.771 --> 12:12.398
YOU HAVE YOUR FILES
BACKED UP, RIGHT? OKAY.
MM‐HMM. I DO.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.234
BUT IT'S‐‐
GREAT.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.069
IN THE TRASH.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.779
OKAY.
AWESOME.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.406
I LIKE TO KEEP HIS MESSAGES
ON THIS SIDE.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.659
YEAH. I'M GONNA KEEP THEM
ON THIS SIDE,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.244
SO HE CAN GRAB 'EM
AS HE WALKS BY.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.121
WELL, I THINK HE'S PRETTY
USED TO ME HANDING THEM TO HIM.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.998
HEY, THIS IS
CONVENIENT, THANKS.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.709
(The Pinker Tones'
"Welcome to TMCR" playing)

12:31.709 --> 12:33.753
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH ♪

12:33.753 --> 12:36.714
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH ♪

12:36.714 --> 12:39.050
ALL RIGHT,
SO THAT'S ABOUT IT.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.470
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.
OKAY.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.057
OH! DON'T FORGET THIS.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.809
OH, THANKS.
YEAH.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.936
LIKE I WAS NEVER HERE.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.229
(telephone rings)
OH!

12:51.229 --> 12:54.357
OH, WILL YOU‐‐
UH! DANIEL MEADE'S OFFICE.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.943
CAN YOU REMIND DANIEL
THAT WE HAVE A LUNCH?
YEAH. UH‐HUH.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.946
(whispers) GREAT.
YEAH, NO.
THIS IS NATALIE.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.948
YEAH,
I'M HIS NEW ASSISTANT.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.450
YEAH. SURE.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.453
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M
LOOKING AT, DETECTIVE CASTELAR.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.455
IS THAT A SMUDGE OF DIRT?

13:09.455 --> 13:12.458
IT'S A THUMBPRINT.
IN BLOOD.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.420
EH, IF YOU SAY SO.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.423
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU'RE NOT
A TERRIBLY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.801
(chuckles)
I FOUND THE PRINT ON
JONATHAN VIEJA'S BOAT.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.761
IT'S HIS BLOOD.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.848
THE PRINT BELONGS
TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.101
WELL, NICO SPENT A LOT OF TIME
ON THAT BOAT. THEY WERE DATING.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.770
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
YOU THINK THAT PROVES.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.731
I'VE WORKED FOR
JONATHAN'S FAMILY BEFORE‐‐

13:34.731 --> 13:36.649
COVERING UP HIS MESSES.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.236
YOUR EX‐BOYFRIEND WAS NOT
A NICE GUY, WAS HE?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.321
HE HAD A TEMPER‐‐

13:42.321 --> 13:44.741
ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN.
UH, WELL, I‐‐

13:44.741 --> 13:48.036
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S LUCKY
HE'S DISAPPEARED.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.038
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I'M NOT BEING CLEAR.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.415
I DON'T THINK SHE'S LUCKY.
I THINK SHE KILLED HIM.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.917
I THINK SHE
DUMPED THE BODY OVERBOARD,

13:54.917 --> 13:57.378
I THINK SHE GOT SOME HELP
CLEANING UP HER MESS,

13:57.378 --> 14:00.882
AND I THINK YOU
MISSED A SPOT.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.843
WELL, IF YOU THINK
I DO MY OWN CLEANING,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
YOU DON'T KNOW ME VERY WELL.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.806
I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
YOU'D WANT AS AN ENEMY,

14:08.806 --> 14:10.808
MR. CASTELAR.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.811
I'VE WRITTEN A NUMBER
ON THE BACK OF THAT PICTURE.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.689
I PREFER CASH.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.942
(chuckles) ARE YOU ACTUALLY
TRYING TO BLACKMAIL ME?

14:19.942 --> 14:22.945
(chuckles)
WELL, THAT'S ADORABLE.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.573
BUT IT DOESN'T GO
LIKE THAT,

14:25.573 --> 14:27.033
SO GET OUT.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.334
(door opens and closes)

14:36.334 --> 14:39.504
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PAY HIM?

14:39.504 --> 14:42.840
I WILL DO WHAT I ALWAYS DO.
I'LL BEAT HIM AT HIS OWN GAME.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.677
BUT HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL.
YOU WON'T GO TO JAIL!

14:46.677 --> 14:48.721
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.723
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.444
UGH! EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT
THIS <i>RIDIC</i> CHARITY EVENT.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.447
IF YOU ASK ME, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL SNOOZE‐FEST.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.409
I'M SURE A SUPER‐FUN GIRL
LIKE YOU ISN'T GOING, ARE YOU?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.912
OF COURSE I'M GOING.
I'M AN EDITOR. I WAS INVITED.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.915
WHY WOULDN'T I BE GOING?
WHY SO <i>UPSET‐Y,</i> BETTY?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.919
(sighs) SORRY. I'M JUST
IN A REALLY WEIRD PLACE.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.713
DANIEL JUST HIRED
A NEW ASSISTANT

15:22.713 --> 15:25.258
AND MATT INVITED
SOMEONE ELSE.
DID MATT SAY
WHO HE WAS TAKING?!

15:25.258 --> 15:28.261
NO.
OH. WAIT, ARE YOU GOING
BY YOURSELF?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.721
NO!
OH.
WHO ARE YOU BRINGING?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.724
I DON'T KNOW. AMANDA,
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS?

15:33.724 --> 15:37.770
NOTHING. I JUST
WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE...

15:37.770 --> 15:41.440
I KNOW SOME GREAT GUYS
I COULD SET YOU UP WITH.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.776
OH. THANKS.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.945
BUT, UM... I THINK
I'M GONNA ASK A FRIEND.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.698
OH.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.161
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
HEAR HIM OUT.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.164
MOM, THE "WIT AND WHIMSY" COLUMN
HAS BEEN IN "MODE" FOR 60 YEARS.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.332
I'M NOT GONNA CUT IT
JUST TO MAKE ROOM FOR ADS.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.587
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE.
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW
THAT LINE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.673
YOU KNOW, I'M PUTTING A LOT
OF MONEY INTO THIS COMPANY.
OF COURSE I DO.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.759
YOU RARELY WASTE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO REMIND US OF THAT FACT.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.428
(Claire and Cal sigh)

16:10.428 --> 16:13.097
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE

16:13.097 --> 16:15.975
A LITTLE RETURN
ON MY INVESTMENT.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.978
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
CAN'T YOU, SON?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.230
DON'T CALL ME "SON."

16:21.230 --> 16:23.191
RIGHT.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.360
YOU'VE BOTH MADE
YOUR OPINIONS VERY CLEAR.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.156
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL JUST
THINK THIS OVER FOR A BIT.

16:30.156 --> 16:34.660
FINE. LET'S DO THAT.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.461
(indistinct conversations)

16:45.296 --> 16:47.715
MM! THERE YOU ARE.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.637
AND THERE'S NATALIE.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.473
SO NATALIE SAID HOW MUCH FUN
YOU GUYS HAD EARLIER,

16:55.473 --> 16:58.726
SO I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
MIND IF SHE JOINED US.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.396
NOPE. WHAT'S TO MIND?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.194
AND FOR YOU?
JUST AN ICED TEA FOR ME.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.363
YOU GOT IT.
YEAH, THANKS.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.407
OH, YOU'RE NOT EATING?
NO, I'M ON
A SPECIAL DIET.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.910
OH. I MEAN, SORRY,
WHAT IS THAT?

17:15.910 --> 17:19.538
THIS IS <i>MACA‐GREENY</i>
AND CHEESE.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.707
GUESS WHO GAVE ME
THE RECIPE.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.085
UM, GLORIA?
OF COURSE.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.379
(laughing)
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY
GOOD. (laughing)

17:26.379 --> 17:30.007
WHO'S GLORIA?
SHE'S THIS WEIRD WOMAN
FROM GROUP.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.343
OH, SHE IS NOT WEIRD,
SHE'S ECCENTRIC.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.680
SHE WEARS LEG WARMERS
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
(Natalie laughing)

17:35.680 --> 17:38.349
THE POINT IS, SHE ONLY EATS
GREEN FOODS BECAUSE SHE THINKS

17:38.349 --> 17:40.351
THEY HELP HER PHASE BETTER.
(laughing)
(laughing)

17:40.351 --> 17:42.687
WHAT IS‐‐
WHAT'S "PHASE"?
OH, IT'S THIS
EXERCISE THAT WE DO.

17:42.687 --> 17:46.649
INVOLVES BREATHING.
YEAH, IT'S‐‐IT'S
KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.443
OKAY. (chuckles)

17:49.443 --> 17:51.821
UM, SO YOU WERE GONNA
CATCH US UP

17:51.821 --> 17:54.657
ON THINGS WITH
YOU AND MATT, RIGHT?

17:54.657 --> 17:57.285
(inhales)
(Natalie) OH, YEAH.
DANIEL TOLD ME ABOUT YOU GUYS.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.287
YOU'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER
OR SOMETHING?

17:59.287 --> 18:02.623
UM... UH, NO, ACTUALLY. I DON'T
THINK THAT'S GONNA BE HAPPENING.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.585
UH, I DID THINK THAT MAYBE THERE
WAS STILL SOMETHING THERE,

18:05.585 --> 18:06.961
BUT APPARENTLY, HE DIDN'T,

18:06.961 --> 18:09.630
BECAUSE HE'S TAKING SOMEONE ELSE
TO WILHELMINA'S PARTY.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.633
OH, I'M SORRY.
NO. I MEAN, THANKS,
BUT IT'S FINE.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.635
ANYWAY, I WAS THINKING‐‐

18:14.635 --> 18:18.055
YOU KNOW HOW I USED TO ALWAYS BE
YOUR PLUS ONE AT WORK EVENTS?

18:18.055 --> 18:20.891
MM‐HMM.
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
BEING MINE THIS TIME?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.727
OH.

18:22.727 --> 18:27.607
ACTUALLY, UM, I WAS ALREADY
GONNA BRING SOMEONE...

18:27.607 --> 18:30.610
OH. RIGHT. OF COURSE. DUH.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.945
I MEAN,
YOU'RE THE NEW ME, HUH?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.615
YEAH.
BUT YOU CAN TOTALLY
COME AND HANG WITH US.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.533
YEAH.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.869
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE FUN.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.495
<i>THIS</i> IS.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.293
THE WRITERS FINISHED
A DRAFT OF YOUR SPEECH.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.504
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATELY
FAUX‐MODEST, YET PREACHY.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.506
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE A LOOK AT IT, THOUGH.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.009
UGH, I DON'T CARE.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.428
ARE YOU OKAY, WILLIE?

18:57.428 --> 19:00.848
I WAS WORRIED WHEN YOU
RACED OUT OF HERE THIS MORNING.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.850
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.269
BUT I NEED YOU TO DO
SOME RESEARCH.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.480
SEE WHAT DIRT
YOU CAN DIG UP ON THIS‐‐

19:07.480 --> 19:11.150
NO. WILLIE, PLEASE.
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.528
(sighs) I TOOK THIS JOB BECAUSE
I WANTED TO BE A FASHION EDITOR,

19:14.528 --> 19:19.659
NOT A BLACKMAILER
OR A DIGGER OF DIRT OR‐‐

19:19.659 --> 19:22.244
FOND AS I AM
OF ASCOTS AND MONOCLES‐‐

19:22.244 --> 19:24.413
A JUNIOR DETECTIVE.
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.583
(clears throat) I CAN'T SPEND
ONE MORE MOMENT OF MY LIFE

19:27.583 --> 19:29.001
SCROUNGING AROUND IN DUMPSTERS,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.003
LOOKING FOR
HORRIBLE INFORMATION ON PEOPLE.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.507
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I‐I CAN'T
DO IT ANYMORE. I'M SORRY.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.308
NICO KILLED HER BOYFRIEND.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.394
I COVERED IT UP.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.312
THIS DETECTIVE
IS BLACKMAILING ME,

19:48.312 --> 19:51.607
AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.193
I NEED TO FIND OUT
SOMETHING ON THIS GUY

19:54.193 --> 19:57.238
OR WE BOTH GO TO JAIL.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.536
UH, I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.541
(sighs deeply)

20:08.541 --> 20:11.335
AMANDA, HEY! I'M GOING TO
WILHELMINA'S PARTY.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.920
YOU FOUND A FRIEND?
NO.

A PARTY <i>I</i> WAS INVITED TO.
