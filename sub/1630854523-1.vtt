00:49.833 --> 00:55.208
<i>I, Constance Reid,</i>
<i>take you, Clifford Chatterley,</i>

00:56.000 --> 00:58.208
<i>to be my lawfully wedded husband,</i>

00:59.333 --> 01:01.750
<i>to have and to hold from this day forward,</i>

01:01.833 --> 01:04.041
<i>for better and for worse,</i>

01:04.125 --> 01:06.291
<i>for richer and for poorer,</i>

01:06.375 --> 01:08.708
<i>in sickness and in health.</i>

01:21.625 --> 01:23.833
-How does it feel?

01:23.916 --> 01:26.666
-I don't know. Ask me tomorrow.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.875
-You need to eat something.
-I need to get out of this dress.

01:30.833 --> 01:31.916
Ooh.

01:32.416 --> 01:33.250
Mmm.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.291
How do I look?

01:34.375 --> 01:38.166
Well, I doubt Clifford
will want to stay long at the reception.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.916
You don't think
his mother would've approved?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.708
Well, I'm not entirely sure I do.

01:43.791 --> 01:46.250
Are we talking about the dress now, Hilda,

01:46.333 --> 01:48.083
-or the wedding?

01:48.166 --> 01:51.458
He goes back to the front in the morning.
Imagine if we'd left it,

01:51.541 --> 01:53.416
and then something terrible happened.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.958
-Couldn't you have just had sex with him?
-Hilda! Be serious.

01:57.041 --> 02:01.583
I am. It's much less commitment,
and it's all Clifford will want anyway.

02:01.666 --> 02:02.958
Clifford's not like that.

02:03.041 --> 02:06.000
You know him. He's kind and thoughtful.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.250
He makes me feel safe.

02:07.333 --> 02:10.291
His family's more traditional than ours,
I suppose,

02:10.375 --> 02:13.375
but I think his own views
are actually quite progressive.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.625
-Really?
-Yes.

02:14.708 --> 02:15.541
Hmm…

02:16.125 --> 02:20.166
-Does he know about that German boy?
-Yes. And he says it doesn't matter.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.625
It was before the war,
so it doesn't count.

02:22.708 --> 02:26.416
You don't need to convince me.
I had my own German boy, remember?

02:26.500 --> 02:28.625
Well, mine's dead.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.791
-You see, that's just it.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.750
-What?

02:33.833 --> 02:35.791
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.416
You, uh… You open your

02:40.166 --> 02:41.291
heart so easily.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.250
Oh, Hilda!

02:43.250 --> 02:45.333
-Clifford!
-Hmm, reinforcements have arrived.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.625
You read my mind.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.083
I nearly drank yours
on the way up.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.708
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

02:50.791 --> 02:51.625
Well, what now?

02:51.708 --> 02:54.250
Our fathers
are preparing their toasts.

02:54.333 --> 02:55.791
Can we face them together?

02:56.541 --> 02:57.666
Of course.

02:58.541 --> 03:00.041
You look stunning, Con.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.666
Thanks.

03:04.791 --> 03:07.416
-I can hear them.
-Yeah.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.166
Oh…

03:10.875 --> 03:11.875
Are you ready?

03:15.083 --> 03:19.458
-So, here's to Clifford and Connie…

03:19.541 --> 03:23.250
…our new hope for an heir to Wragby.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.125
To Clifford and Connie.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.166
Father, that's not just why we married.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.458
No, why else would a baronet get married?

03:29.541 --> 03:31.208
-Shh.

03:31.291 --> 03:34.083
-I married because I found Connie.
-And I you.

03:36.916 --> 03:40.416
We would like to thank those
who donated their butter and sugar rations

03:40.500 --> 03:42.041
to help us celebrate.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.250
To the next heir of Chatterley.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.833
-To the Chatterleys!

03:54.708 --> 03:56.250
We'll just watch and wait.

04:10.958 --> 04:11.958
Oh yeah.

04:17.958 --> 04:18.791
Oh God.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.750
"Why else is a baronet ever married?"

04:21.416 --> 04:22.666
Unbelievable.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.583
Do you want children, Clifford?

04:24.666 --> 04:26.833
Uh, yeah. Yeah, someday.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.250
-For our sake, not for my father's.
-Hmm.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.166
Assuming you would.

04:32.875 --> 04:33.875
I think so, yes.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.333
What? You all right?

04:53.416 --> 04:55.666
Yes, um, of course. Sorry. Uh…

04:56.666 --> 04:57.708
It's just, um…

05:00.291 --> 05:02.375
I can't stop thinking
about going back to the front.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.625
-I… I know I'll be all right.
-You will be.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.833
-We don't have to do anything.
-No, no, I… I want to.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.541
Sure you don't want me
to come to the station?

05:23.625 --> 05:24.916
Thanks.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.541
Let's not make a ceremony of it, shall we?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.083
I love you, Con.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.125
Bye.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.500
I look forward to your letters.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.750
I'll write to you every day.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.583
<i>Dearest Hilda,</i>
<i>I knew the war would change us all,</i>

06:25.333 --> 06:26.958
<i>but I just wasn't sure how much.</i>

06:29.833 --> 06:32.208
<i>It feels as though</i>
<i>it ended half a lifetime ago,</i>

06:32.291 --> 06:33.416
<i>not just half a year.</i>

06:33.958 --> 06:35.833
<i>We've already moved away from London.</i>

06:37.000 --> 06:38.666
<i>We've just arrived at Wragby,</i>

06:40.125 --> 06:41.625
<i>Clifford's family estate.</i>

06:43.458 --> 06:46.125
<i>Once we're settled in,</i>
<i>I expect to write to you often.</i>

06:46.791 --> 06:48.958
<i>Your loving sister, Connie.</i>

06:56.541 --> 06:57.541
Thank you.

07:00.875 --> 07:04.291
Welcome home, Sir Clifford.
We've been praying for you.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.083
Thank you, Mr. Warren.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.458
There's the one

07:12.333 --> 07:13.333
All right.

07:16.666 --> 07:18.375
Thank you. I can, uh… I can manage.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.833
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, this is my wife,

07:24.041 --> 07:25.291
the new Lady Chatterley.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.083
It's so nice to meet you, milady.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.125
There's plenty of work to be done.

07:32.708 --> 07:35.083
Hire back all the workers
we can, Mrs. Warren.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.625
Old girl's seen better days.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.833
We'll bring her back to life.

07:40.958 --> 07:44.500
We thought you might like to use
your father's study as the master bedroom,

07:44.583 --> 07:46.416
so you don't have to bother
with the stairs.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.208
Thank you, Mrs. Warren.

07:49.541 --> 07:50.458
No.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.375
No, let's put the luggage in here.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.583
We'll use the library as a master.

07:59.541 --> 08:00.833
-Wow.

08:02.416 --> 08:05.833
What is more inspiring
for a writer than to sleep among books?

08:09.958 --> 08:13.291
This is where they found Father.
They say his heart gave out.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.583
I think he died of chagrin.

08:16.666 --> 08:19.458
Clifford… it's all done now.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.750
Life is what we make of it.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.625
-Mrs. Warren.
-Yes.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.791
Let's open the curtains,
let some light in.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.166
Of course, milady.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.750
-We should have a look around.
-I will.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.708
You're welcome to use
the private room above the library

08:37.791 --> 08:39.166
with the family portraits.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.125
You can have
the whole of the second floor.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.958
Welcome home, Clifford.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.916
You all right? I've got you.
Lean on me, put your weight on me.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.708
-Ready?
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

09:37.541 --> 09:39.916
I'm getting the hang of it.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.333
-Love it.
-Mmm.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.333
You know, um…

09:47.291 --> 09:50.416
I'm thinking of expanding
the short story I wrote in Cambridge.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.208
-Hmm?
-Turning it into a novel.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.000
-It's a wonderful idea.
-You think?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.208
Mm-hmm.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.625
-You'll be my editor?
-Of course.

09:57.708 --> 10:00.125
Proofreader, typist.
I'll submit my application.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.041
I'll get you to the top of the pile.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.125
-All right?
-Yes.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.833
-Ooh, this bed is softer than I thought.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.916
-First night at Wragby. Hmm.
-Welcome.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.791
-Oh, sorry.
-Oh, you're fine. Really.

10:54.875 --> 10:55.708
What?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.125
I'm sorry, Con.

11:01.541 --> 11:03.250
I just can't anymore, you know?

11:04.500 --> 11:05.416
I'm so sorry.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.583
It's all right. Don't worry.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.416
You'll be fine?

11:12.916 --> 11:13.750
Yes.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.500
I love you, Con.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.125
This is misfortune, but you'll see.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.916
We… We'll be happy here

11:35.958 --> 11:36.875
at Wragby.

11:42.708 --> 11:43.583
Hello, sir.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.916
I'm a strong, hardworking man,
and I will not let you down.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.541
Lily Wheedon.
My mum worked for Sir Geoffrey.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.000
Really?

11:54.416 --> 11:55.333
Oliver Mellors?

11:56.583 --> 11:59.083
You, uh, worked for my father
before the war.

11:59.833 --> 12:00.666
Aye, sir.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.041
-And you were an army lieutenant.
-I was, sir.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.708
Do you honestly believe
that a return to gamekeeping

12:06.791 --> 12:09.416
will be satisfying
after your time as an officer?

12:10.291 --> 12:11.833
Bit of quiet'd do me good.

12:13.125 --> 12:16.291
-I've seen enough of what war does to men.
-Hmm.

12:16.375 --> 12:17.666
As have I.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.291
You must know your way
around the estate better than I do.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.583
Oh, no, milady.
I couldn't visit while she was working.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.916
Very well then. Welcome back, Mr. Mellors.

12:27.708 --> 12:28.583
Sir.

12:28.666 --> 12:32.041
In that case, we'll have to
learn our way around together. Won't we?

12:32.125 --> 12:33.916
-Hmm.
-Thank you, Lily.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.750
My name is Kelly Martin, milady.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.041
-Thank you.
-I've been a maid for five years.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.208
<i>Dear Hilda,</i>

12:45.291 --> 12:47.583
<i>I'm a thoughtless lout</i>
<i>for not writing sooner.</i>

12:48.708 --> 12:52.083
<i>In my defense, Wragby needed</i>
<i>an enormous amount of tending to.</i>

12:53.291 --> 12:54.916
<i>But we finally have a full staff</i>

12:55.000 --> 12:57.125
<i>who've done wonders</i>
<i>in restoring the place.</i>

13:02.333 --> 13:04.000
<i>Clifford's strength has returned.</i>

13:05.916 --> 13:08.750
<i>I'm still the only one</i>
<i>he's willing to let help him,</i>

13:08.833 --> 13:11.333
<i>but every day,</i>
<i>he can do more and more on his own.</i>

13:15.458 --> 13:17.708
<i>He's writing, all the time,</i>

13:18.625 --> 13:22.291
<i>which keeps his spirits up,</i>
<i>and he's nearly finished his first novel.</i>

13:23.666 --> 13:26.500
"I first met Mrs. Gertrude
at a dinner, comma,

13:26.583 --> 13:28.875
-thrown by Lord Witherby."

13:28.958 --> 13:31.750
Witherby, W-I-T-H-E-R-B-Y.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.416
"With the sort of fellow, whom--"
I'm quite pleased with this…

13:35.958 --> 13:39.166
-"The sort of fellow…"
-<i>It is quiet here in the country.</i>

13:40.916 --> 13:43.041
<i>I miss the life we had in London,</i>

13:43.125 --> 13:44.708
<i>and, of course, I miss you.</i>

13:46.333 --> 13:48.625
<i>But we have to live, I suppose,</i>

13:48.708 --> 13:50.583
<i>no matter how many skies have fallen.</i>

13:52.708 --> 13:54.250
<i>We have had some guests.</i>

13:54.750 --> 13:56.708
<i>Mostly Clifford's old bachelor friends.</i>

13:57.291 --> 14:00.916
<i>It's hardly surprising that most of them</i>
<i>haven't found women, believe me.</i>

14:01.625 --> 14:03.916
<i>Now and again,</i>
<i>we also get visits from writers</i>

14:04.000 --> 14:05.875
<i>whose advice Clifford has sought out.</i>

14:06.458 --> 14:07.875
<i>Apparently, my old friends</i>

14:07.958 --> 14:10.208
<i>all seem to think</i>
<i>misfortune is contagious.</i>

14:22.666 --> 14:23.625
<i>I know you and Owen</i>

14:23.708 --> 14:26.208
<i>have been traveling everywhere</i>
<i>since the war ended,</i>

14:27.083 --> 14:30.166
<i>but once you've settled back home,</i>
<i>I would so love to see you.</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:37.958
-Am I interrupting?
-No, not at all.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.083
I was thinking
about going to London for a few days

14:41.666 --> 14:43.125
to visit Hilda.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.958
Leaving me to fend for myself?

14:45.041 --> 14:47.375
We do have
a house full of servants.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.250
I don't need servants. I need you.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.458
Why don't you invite Hilda?
She'd be more than welcome.

14:53.541 --> 14:56.791
I have. She can't get away
from London for a few weeks.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.250
Hmm. I'm glad at least she can come.

15:03.791 --> 15:05.166
I'm going to go for a walk.

15:06.041 --> 15:09.583
Why? We can send Mrs. Warren
out for anything you might need.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.625
I don't need anything, Clifford.
I just want to go for a walk.

15:15.000 --> 15:15.833
Very well, dear.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.333
-As you like.
-Jesus.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.708
-Hello.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.750
Flossie! Come here, lass.

16:06.916 --> 16:07.791
Come on.

16:08.416 --> 16:10.250
Good girl. Good girl.

16:15.833 --> 16:19.583
I wandered further down and I found this
stream running right through the woods.

16:19.666 --> 16:25.041
I, uh, think I know the place.
Doubt I'd be able to get there anymore.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.458
I'm sure we can find a way
if you wanted to go.

16:28.708 --> 16:29.666
-Right.
-Perhaps.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.083
Here we are.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.291
-Ready?
-Yes.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.041
All right.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.458
It's fine.

16:39.875 --> 16:40.958
-It's all right?
-Yes.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.750
Uh, I don't want you to drop me.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.166
I'm not going to drop you.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.666
Look, just, um…

16:45.750 --> 16:46.750
There we go.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.458
There we are. That's fine.
Just let me go there.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.041
Thank you. Thank you.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.541
Ah. There.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.875
-See, you didn't need my help at all.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.958
-There must be times you hate me for this.
-No.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.125
I wouldn't blame you.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.291
There are days
I wish I hadn't made it back.

17:20.041 --> 17:20.875
Clifford.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.916
Don't talk like that.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.541
I'd be lost without you, Con.
You know that.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.583
Let's open some windows,
get some fresh air in here.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.625
I've never seen the sky so clear.

17:43.708 --> 17:47.166
Yes, well, there's no smoke in the air.
Mines are closed for May Day.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.208
You should go down to Tevershall.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.916
See the fair. You can, you know?

17:54.291 --> 17:55.750
Just be back in time for tea.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.708
-Yes, I might.
-Hmm.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.791
-Nice to see you, Lady Chatterley.
-Milady.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.333
It's nice to meet you, Lady Chatterley.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.000
Oh, that's so kind.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.041
Thank you.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.958
Happy May Day to you, milady.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.125
Happy May Day.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.083
Who's this? She's precious.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.041
-This is my Josephine.
-Hi, Josephine.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.958
Say hello to Lady Chatterley.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.250
I seem to be having
that effect on people today.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.958
I'm Mrs. Flint.
I'm a schoolteacher here in the village.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.666
I'm Connie. Lovely to meet you.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.458
My, uh… My husband
leases Marehay Farm from your estate.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.333
-Marehay Farm?
-It's not far from where you are.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.958
Side by side we fight forever.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.166
More in numbers makes them stop.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.958
Just as long as we stand together.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.416
What was that?

19:23.666 --> 19:26.583
The miners.
They're out protesting again.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.333
-Again?
-Leave him!

19:29.416 --> 19:32.041
Um, that, um… That happens a lot?

19:32.125 --> 19:34.458
They must've been
from one of the other mines.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.708
They'd lose their jobs if they marched
like that through their own village.

19:38.291 --> 19:42.125
Does it mean our miners from Tevershall
protest in other villages?

19:43.541 --> 19:44.458
I wouldn't know.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.125
I may teach their children,

19:46.208 --> 19:48.916
but I'm an outsider
when it comes to the miners' wives.

19:49.916 --> 19:51.416
That makes two of us.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.750
-Well, hello, Lady Chatterley.
-Hello.

19:54.958 --> 19:56.875
You should come
to Marehay one day.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.958
-We'd love to have you.
-I'd love that.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.166
Thank you.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.666
Where are we going?

20:08.750 --> 20:11.458
You've always wanted me
to join you on one of your walks.

20:11.541 --> 20:13.708
I thought of somewhere
I'd like to show you.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.458
-Don't think your chair was made for this.

20:20.916 --> 20:24.958
Ah, Mellors. Give us a hand
trying to get this chair started again.

20:25.041 --> 20:25.958
Yes, sir.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.583
Uh, Connie, have you met Mellors,
our new gamekeeper?

20:32.958 --> 20:34.125
Get down, you, Floss.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.208
She's just being friendly.

20:37.958 --> 20:38.833
Now, then.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.541
You've been at Wragby
sometime, Mr. Mellors?

20:41.625 --> 20:43.916
I was raised here, Your Ladyship.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.291
-Whoa.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.083
Need some help?

20:52.166 --> 20:55.708
Mellors is quite capable
of pushing on his own. There we are.

20:58.916 --> 21:00.791
-Now… Now, now.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.541
Ooh. Ah.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.875
Nothing else, sir?

21:03.958 --> 21:05.375
Nothing else. Good day.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.750
That was kind of you.
Hope it wasn't too heavy.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.583
No, not heavy.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.666
Good day to you, Your Ladyship.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.250
I used to come here as a lad,
sit for hours.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.541
One of the finest views
in all the Midlands.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.833
I want to restore these woods.

21:32.916 --> 21:36.000
If these places aren't preserved,
there'll be no England left.

21:36.083 --> 21:39.333
Our way of life will end,
never mind what we gave up to defend it.

21:42.166 --> 21:45.416
I mind not being able to have a son here
more than any other place.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.291
I'm sorry we can't have one.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.708
Almost be a good thing
if you had a son by another man.

21:55.416 --> 21:56.458
You're not serious?

21:56.541 --> 21:58.750
-Why not?
-Why not? Because…

21:59.625 --> 22:01.291
Because we're married.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.583
I married you, Clifford.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.666
Why would you even suggest such a thing?

22:06.375 --> 22:08.291
You've told me
how much you'd love a child.

22:08.791 --> 22:11.708
This way, you could have one
to dote on, to fill your days.

22:12.666 --> 22:15.833
As far as anyone else knows, I might
still be capable of fathering a child.

22:15.916 --> 22:18.208
If we raised him here at Wragby,
he'd be ours.

22:21.208 --> 22:22.458
Do you really mean this?

22:23.916 --> 22:27.791
Well, of course, I wouldn't want you
to yield yourself completely to him,

22:27.875 --> 22:31.833
but the mechanical act of sex is nothing
when compared to a life lived together.

22:32.416 --> 22:34.166
If you govern your emotions accordingly,

22:34.250 --> 22:36.916
we could arrange this
like a trip to the dentist.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.875
A trip to the…

22:44.666 --> 22:47.250
And you wouldn't mind
what man's child I had?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.750
I trust your judgment. You wouldn't let
the wrong sort of fellow touch you.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.625
Someone of the utmost discretion.
The Chatterley name depends on it.

22:58.791 --> 23:01.208
Would you expect me
to tell you who this man was?

23:02.291 --> 23:03.208
Best I don't know.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.666
An heir really means this much to you?

23:10.375 --> 23:12.083
It means a lot to the people here.

23:14.791 --> 23:17.458
I know you can do it for them
and for the Chatterleys.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.416
You do agree with me, don't you?

23:44.875 --> 23:45.875
I'm going ahead.

23:46.666 --> 23:47.583
Okay.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.791
They're all talking about your book
in London. It's good work.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.083
You really think so?

24:10.166 --> 24:12.000
I wanted to write something special.

24:12.083 --> 24:15.333
Not just popular,
but something really first class.

24:15.416 --> 24:18.708
The entire pals collective
across the entire northeast,

24:18.791 --> 24:21.750
keeping them together,
making sure they've got all of--

24:21.833 --> 24:24.333
So sorry. Will you excuse me?
Just for a second?

24:24.416 --> 24:25.750
Uh, yes. Um…

24:25.833 --> 24:28.083
-Thank you. Thank you, sir.

24:32.583 --> 24:35.208
You imagine they've solved
the world's problems yet?

24:35.291 --> 24:37.375
I'm sure they think they have.

24:37.458 --> 24:40.041
Shame they've forgotten
their solutions by daybreak.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.416
You're a writer.
Maybe you should take notes.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.916
I doubt I'd be welcome
in that drinking circle.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.500
Don't worry. I'm not really
a part of this world, either.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.208
-Oh, but you grew up in it, didn't you?
-Hardly. My father's an artist.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.458
So I grew up between rented villas

24:55.541 --> 24:58.625
and woke up each morning
to the smell of turpentine.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.791
Sounds like quite the Bohemian lifestyle.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.416
There must be days
when you don't feel like a lady at all.

25:06.375 --> 25:10.333
I head back home in the morning.
With luck, he'd invite me to visit again.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.208
That's the last time
we'll invite the Irish playwright.

25:18.458 --> 25:19.791
-Michaelis?
-Hmm.

25:21.125 --> 25:23.083
He writes well, he knows how to dress,

25:23.833 --> 25:26.208
but he's got the manners
of a Dublin street rat.

25:30.250 --> 25:34.000
Maybe because he knows he's only around
as long as people deem him useful.

25:35.416 --> 25:36.791
We all know where we stand.

25:39.583 --> 25:41.958
You ought to eat something.
You're wasting away.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.083
-I'm not feeling well.
-Hmm? Mmm.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.666
I haven't been feeling well
since our conversation.

25:50.625 --> 25:51.458
Clifford.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.791
Here we are, look!

25:54.875 --> 25:56.625
I got my picture in the paper.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.375
Hmm. Chatterley's novella
has garnered attention

26:01.458 --> 26:04.250
for its humorous analysis
of people and their motives,

26:04.916 --> 26:08.791
though his views on modern society
are not young and playful,

26:08.875 --> 26:11.666
but curiously old
and obscenely conceited."

26:11.750 --> 26:14.916
-Clifford, stop reading.
-"A wonderful display of nothingness."

26:15.000 --> 26:16.291
It's just one review.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.583
But they're right.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.458
They… they've seen right through me.

26:22.583 --> 26:23.791
It's all nothing.

26:24.375 --> 26:28.791
A home, love,
sex, marriage, friendship, all of it.

26:29.875 --> 26:30.875
You don't mean that.

26:31.583 --> 26:32.500
I think I do.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.708
I do. The whole point of living

26:35.791 --> 26:38.416
is learning to accept
the great nothingness of life.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.750
I'm going to get dressed.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.458
-Connie. Connie, it's me.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.791
Oh my God, you came.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.208
-What's wrong?
-I…

27:51.208 --> 27:52.833
-What's wrong?

27:54.833 --> 27:55.916
Tell me what's wrong.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.291
-What on earth are you doing?

28:01.458 --> 28:02.375
What's this?

28:03.041 --> 28:05.750
I just… I wanted a change and…

28:09.541 --> 28:10.625
You're ill.

28:10.708 --> 28:13.333
-No, I'm fine.
-Has no one been looking after you?

28:14.250 --> 28:16.583
Um, they have.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.375
I'm so tired of them watching me, Hilda.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.708
It's inescapable. It's…

28:23.250 --> 28:24.375
I'm so tired.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.083
It's okay.

28:31.666 --> 28:32.625
Thank you.

28:45.583 --> 28:47.083
Connie's not well, Clifford.

28:47.166 --> 28:48.208
You think?

28:48.291 --> 28:51.041
She's exhausted.
Look how thin she's gotten.

28:51.125 --> 28:54.125
I'm afraid
it doesn't suit her to be a half-virgin.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.625
This chair
doesn't very much suit me either, Hilda.

28:57.708 --> 29:00.791
What do you propose?
Find her another of your German soldiers?

29:00.875 --> 29:04.833
She needs to see a doctor.
Do you have one you, uh, use around here?

29:04.916 --> 29:05.875
I'll look into it.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.916
No. I'll take her to a doctor we trust.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.041
In the meantime,

29:11.541 --> 29:14.083
you must hire someone
to take care of you personally.

29:14.166 --> 29:17.916
-I'm doing perfectly well, thank you.
-I'm not worried about you, Clifford.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.833
Who's taking care of her
while she's taking care of you?

29:21.916 --> 29:24.791
-Connie and I will discuss it.
-Connie and I already have.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.458
-I believe you know this woman.

29:28.541 --> 29:31.833
Mrs. Bolton.
She cared for you when you were young.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.958
Connie won't be your caregiver any longer.

29:37.125 --> 29:39.958
We're so grateful
that you could come. Really.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.541
It must be hard for Sir Clifford,

29:42.625 --> 29:45.041
all he's suffered,
and hard on you as well.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.000
You think your know how life will be,
and suddenly it's gone.

29:49.083 --> 29:53.125
I only had my Ted for three years
before he was killed in mines.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.833
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.083
Never you mind.

29:56.166 --> 30:00.375
Now, you just follow doctor's orders
and leave the care of Sir Clifford to me.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.583
Ah, Clifford. This is Mrs. Bolton.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.916
I remember Mrs. Bolton.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.250
-Are we all satisfied?
-For the time being.

30:10.083 --> 30:13.416
I'm headed back to London,
and Connie's going for a nice long walk.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.583
Good. Safe travels.

30:16.166 --> 30:18.583
Connie, would you stop in
at the gamekeeper?

30:18.666 --> 30:20.833
Ask if the new pheasants
have begun laying?

30:21.416 --> 30:22.333
Of course.

31:39.916 --> 31:40.916
Lady Chatterley.

31:42.791 --> 31:45.125
-Does Sir Clifford need help?
-No. He sent me.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.833
-Sorry, I don't mean to intrude.
-No.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.250
Do you want to come in?

31:57.416 --> 32:01.000
-Sorry. I'm not dressed for company.
-No. Not to worry.

32:01.583 --> 32:02.708
I just wanted, um…

32:02.791 --> 32:06.041
Sir Clifford wanted to know
if the new pheasants had begun laying.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.541
Oh, aye. Yes, milady. Yeah.

32:08.625 --> 32:11.500
There'll be plenty of young chicks
in a matter of weeks.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.666
This is a lovely little cottage.
You live alone here?

32:16.750 --> 32:18.000
Quite alone, milady.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.083
You read James Joyce?

32:23.583 --> 32:24.916
That one was hard to find.

32:25.000 --> 32:25.958
Do you read much?

32:27.125 --> 32:29.875
Well, it suits my solitary nature.

32:31.833 --> 32:32.708
Still.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.500
Must be awfully quiet around here.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.125
No, I've got Flossie for company.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.541
Mm-hmm.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.166
Um…

32:44.208 --> 32:47.333
Well, um, I'll let Clifford know

32:48.166 --> 32:49.250
about the pheasants.

32:49.958 --> 32:51.708
Um, thank you.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.708
-I'll see you out then.
-All right.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.916
-Apologies.

32:58.875 --> 33:00.041
Lovely flowers.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.416
Take some back with you.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.208
-No, I couldn't.
-Why not?

33:07.083 --> 33:08.166
They're yours.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.291
-You sure?
-Yeah, help yoursen.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.416
Good day, then.

33:29.458 --> 33:32.250
Mrs. Flint. I brought you some flowers.

33:32.958 --> 33:35.541
They're beautiful!
Aren't you thoughtful!

33:36.583 --> 33:39.250
-It's quite all right.
-Let's get you a vase. Sit down.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.875
They're all growing in the fields
by the keeper's cottage. Everywhere.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.666
Here, have these.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.166
Ah. Oh.

33:49.750 --> 33:51.833
Interesting fellow, isn't he, the keeper?

33:52.541 --> 33:54.541
He seems gruff at first, but then…

33:55.541 --> 33:59.333
The older teachers still talk about
how clever Oliver Mellors was as a lad.

33:59.833 --> 34:02.416
It's no wonder
he came back home a full lieutenant.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.583
But now he lives down there? Alone?

34:06.708 --> 34:08.541
He was married. Um…

34:09.041 --> 34:12.208
But, uh, his wife, Bertha,

34:12.291 --> 34:15.250
the whole time he was gone,
she carried on with other men.

34:15.958 --> 34:18.000
It was awful. Everyone knew.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
So, they're divorced now?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.875
Oh, not properly, I don't think.

34:23.958 --> 34:27.291
Uh, but there never was
much proper about Bertha Coutts.

34:27.958 --> 34:30.916
She's off living
with another man at Stacks Gate.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.166
Ned, I think his name is.

34:34.125 --> 34:37.625
I imagine Mr. Mellors would be happier
never hearing from either again.

34:40.166 --> 34:41.291
This is Wendy.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.375
Hello, Wendy.

34:43.750 --> 34:44.708
She's beautiful.

35:55.291 --> 35:57.708
There was
an explosion in the mines,

35:57.791 --> 35:59.666
and Ted was only 28.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.125
The company
said it was his own fault somehow.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.791
He was running away
when he should have laid down.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.291
Though the compensation was only £300.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.041
I'll never forgive them for that.

36:12.125 --> 36:14.166
Them branding Ted a coward.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.750
He wasn't a coward, though, Mrs. Bolton.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.666
He was only trying to survive.

36:21.666 --> 36:23.416
You really should let Lily do that.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.166
You're his nurse, not his servant.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.250
No, I don't mind. Busy hands, quiet mind.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.333
Oh, there's the bell. I have to go.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.083
I wondered what the hammering was.

37:33.666 --> 37:35.791
I'm prepping the coops
for the new chicks.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.791
-Oh.

37:41.916 --> 37:44.250
-Is there a chair in this hut?

37:47.541 --> 37:48.708
Come on in.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.041
Thank you.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.583
I'll light you a fire, milady.

37:59.083 --> 38:01.625
-Oh. No, don't bother.
-No, I insist.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.666
-Warm yourself up a little bit.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.083
-All right?
-Thank you.

38:58.333 --> 39:00.250
I never knew this hut was here before.

39:02.166 --> 39:03.583
Not many do.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.458
It's why I like it.

39:07.541 --> 39:09.541
Do you keep it locked
when you're not around?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.125
Sometimes, milady.

39:12.208 --> 39:13.083
Can I have a key?

39:14.333 --> 39:15.541
You want a key?

39:16.875 --> 39:17.708
Hmm.

39:17.791 --> 39:19.750
I think I'd like to sit here sometimes.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.875
I don't know if there is another key.

39:30.083 --> 39:32.208
Well, I'll see to it myself, then.

39:48.666 --> 39:49.833
Quite the walk you had.

39:50.583 --> 39:51.958
Sorry. Am I late?

39:52.833 --> 39:54.833
Could have asked Mrs. Bolton to make tea.

39:54.916 --> 39:56.875
I don't quite see her
presiding at the tea table.

39:56.958 --> 40:00.583
Hmm. I don't remember
anything about tea in our wedding vows.

40:04.583 --> 40:07.916
Do you know if there's a second key
to the hut where the pheasants are reared?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.500
Uh, yes. There may be one
in the study. Why?

40:11.291 --> 40:14.083
I thought it was quite lovely.
Might read my book there.

40:14.166 --> 40:16.000
Books by that degenerate Irishman?

40:16.583 --> 40:18.041
What? James Joyce?

40:18.125 --> 40:20.458
I heard his next
is to be banned for obscenity.

40:20.541 --> 40:23.791
Hmm, such a shame.
I was looking forward to reading it.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.125
-Was Mellors at the hut?
-Mm-hmm.

40:31.708 --> 40:34.375
-He didn't appreciate the intrusion.
-What did he say?

40:35.500 --> 40:37.375
Nothing. It was just his manner.

40:38.333 --> 40:40.541
Don't think he liked me
having freedom of the castle.

40:40.625 --> 40:44.000
Comes with a lieutenant
going back to being gamekeeper.

40:44.083 --> 40:47.500
What do you expect, giving a fellow
like that rank and a sense of importance

40:47.583 --> 40:48.791
then taking it all away?

40:52.958 --> 40:54.041
<i>Dear Hilda,</i>

40:55.041 --> 40:57.458
<i>I hope it hasn't been raining</i>
<i>all week in London.</i>

40:58.375 --> 40:59.291
<i>It has here.</i>

41:00.458 --> 41:04.333
<i>Until now, I've been able to go out</i>
<i>and explore the grounds all I liked.</i>

41:05.000 --> 41:08.125
<i>But I've spent</i>
<i>most of this last week cooped up,</i>

41:08.208 --> 41:10.041
<i>aching to get back outside.</i>

41:12.000 --> 41:14.125
<i>I'm writing now from a little hut I found.</i>

41:15.125 --> 41:17.708
<i>A secret place</i>
<i>where I can hide away from the world.</i>

41:18.791 --> 41:20.458
<i>Only one other person comes here.</i>

41:25.458 --> 41:28.625
Don't worry. I was just going.
Only came to get out the rain.

41:31.041 --> 41:31.875
Here.

41:32.750 --> 41:35.375
I shall leave this here
until I get another one.

42:00.416 --> 42:03.625
Look at you.
You must be lord of the manor.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.916
So, it's a simple enough game.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.125
It begins with a 32-card deck
running seven through ace…

42:39.041 --> 42:43.291
…he died last year from a fall.

42:43.375 --> 42:45.375
Eighty-three he was.

42:45.458 --> 42:48.208
-The chicks have started hatching.
-Oh, good.

42:48.291 --> 42:50.500
-I got Madrid. Listen to this.

42:50.583 --> 42:52.333
<i>…of evidence of young feds.</i>

42:52.416 --> 42:53.541
What are they saying?

42:54.125 --> 42:55.083
Damn!

42:56.833 --> 42:58.958
-I've lost the signal.
-Oh.

42:59.875 --> 43:01.000
Damn!

43:01.083 --> 43:02.708
Well, the young have…

43:03.458 --> 43:07.625
Most have left Tevershall, they say,
now the coal's running thin.

43:07.708 --> 43:10.458
It won't be long
before the town's finished.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.166
-Finished? Are they really saying that?
-Hmm.

43:16.166 --> 43:19.000
Mrs. Bolton,
will you call down to the mines?

43:19.083 --> 43:23.041
-See that Mr. Linley joins us for dinner.
-Will do, sir. Absolutely.

43:25.666 --> 43:27.916
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>be with you in Venice,</i>

43:29.333 --> 43:31.791
<i>but Clifford says</i>
<i>he can't manage here without me.</i>

43:32.458 --> 43:33.916
<i>Not yet at least.</i>

43:34.916 --> 43:36.916
<i>But I'll come</i>
<i>on the next holiday, I promise.</i>

43:38.541 --> 43:42.458
<i>With love, your sister Connie.</i>

43:45.500 --> 43:47.458
Well, if it starts
to increase profits.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.291
That should keep them in business
for the foreseeable future.

43:50.375 --> 43:53.958
-We can modernize as well. Why not?
-Clifford, what about your writing?

43:54.458 --> 43:56.291
The literary world doesn't need me.

43:56.375 --> 43:59.666
But the mine's a sinking ship.
It needs a proper captain to save her.

43:59.750 --> 44:02.333
Don't you think the miners
have led grim enough lives?

44:02.416 --> 44:05.416
I mean, couldn't you just
help them move on?

44:05.500 --> 44:06.583
To what? Begging?

44:06.666 --> 44:10.208
"Help them move on."
You talk like a woman.

44:10.916 --> 44:12.250
Spoken like a man.

44:12.333 --> 44:14.375
Mr. Linley,
how much might it cost us,

44:14.458 --> 44:17.041
a ballpark, to build a chemical work?

44:17.125 --> 44:20.166
Initially,
I'd say around £500 to £700.

44:20.250 --> 44:22.666
Obviously, within that,
there is contingency…

44:56.041 --> 44:57.291
Came to see the chicks.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.708
How many do we have now?

45:04.791 --> 45:06.750
-Eighteen.
-Eighteen.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.250
Can I touch one?

45:12.333 --> 45:13.250
Yeah, go on.

45:14.750 --> 45:15.916
What if it pecks at me?

45:16.458 --> 45:17.416
Just peck it back.

45:21.500 --> 45:22.500
Ooh.

45:29.958 --> 45:30.958
You just…

45:34.750 --> 45:37.500
-Ah… Oh…
-Uh…

45:47.625 --> 45:49.291
That's it. Gently.

45:50.250 --> 45:53.250
-He's trembling.
-You're trembling more than he is.

46:05.875 --> 46:06.916
That's the way.

46:30.833 --> 46:32.458
-Milady?

46:34.333 --> 46:35.208
Here…

46:36.750 --> 46:38.916
Shall we get you
sat down in there a minute?

46:39.000 --> 46:40.500
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

46:44.708 --> 46:45.625
Sorry.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.208
So that's how it's been, eh?

46:59.375 --> 47:00.250
Dinna cry.

47:05.083 --> 47:06.708
Let's get you by the fire.

47:13.958 --> 47:16.208
-I want more firewood.
-Okay.

47:19.166 --> 47:20.166
Please don't go.

50:40.583 --> 50:41.666
I'll walk you back.

50:59.541 --> 51:00.750
You all right, milady?

51:01.500 --> 51:02.333
Mm-hmm.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.375
You?

51:05.833 --> 51:06.666
Mm-hmm.

51:08.125 --> 51:09.625
I should probably go on alone.

51:21.166 --> 51:22.250
Goodbye then.

51:22.333 --> 51:24.000
Goodbye, milady.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.708
There you are, milady.
I thought you'd gone lost.

52:15.791 --> 52:17.041
No, I'm absolutely fine.

52:17.666 --> 52:20.708
Why did you lock the door?
I only went to see the new chicks.

52:20.791 --> 52:21.916
Sorry.

52:23.708 --> 52:26.500
Is Clifford upset?
I didn't say goodbye to the guests.

52:26.583 --> 52:29.500
Oh, he hasn't said anything.
He's still in with Mr. Linley.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.666
Oh, so he didn't notice I was gone?

52:32.750 --> 52:35.083
-Oh, Milady, you know Sir Clifford.

52:35.583 --> 52:36.500
Night.

52:41.875 --> 52:44.791
No, no, of course, it's uh…
It's very similar…

52:45.583 --> 52:47.750
-Good night, Con.
-Good night.

53:54.166 --> 53:55.500
I've been waiting for you.

53:57.541 --> 54:01.000
Don't you think folks will become
suspicious if you keep coming here?

54:02.000 --> 54:05.666
Imagine how lowered you'd feel,
you with your husband's gamekeeper.

54:06.791 --> 54:07.625
You afraid?

54:08.458 --> 54:09.500
I bloody well am.

54:10.875 --> 54:12.125
I bloody well am, yeah.

54:13.291 --> 54:15.708
Not of what people think of me, milady.

54:17.125 --> 54:20.541
But if you were to ever feel sorry
for what we've been--

54:38.291 --> 54:39.291
We have to be quick.

54:59.583 --> 55:00.625
This.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.375
I can't stay long.

55:25.458 --> 55:26.541
Someone will notice.

55:38.541 --> 55:39.625
Look at me.

56:53.625 --> 56:55.166
-Huh?

56:58.833 --> 56:59.708
I need to go.

57:14.583 --> 57:16.541
Do we still feel like strangers to you?

57:17.666 --> 57:18.666
Pardon me?

57:19.750 --> 57:21.375
Do we still feel like strangers?

57:28.791 --> 57:30.583
Not like strangers I've ever known.

57:52.083 --> 57:53.541
Come to the cottage tomorrow.

57:56.625 --> 57:57.625
If I can.

58:00.333 --> 58:01.291
Good night.

58:01.958 --> 58:03.583
Good night, then, Your Ladyship.

58:06.875 --> 58:08.125
-Oliver.
-Yes?

58:31.708 --> 58:34.208
If we can
produce that fuel here, then it'll--

58:36.083 --> 58:37.125
Connie?

58:37.708 --> 58:40.750
-Connie… Are you all right?
-Hmm.

58:40.833 --> 58:44.583
-Not feeling unwell again?
-No, not at all. Sorry. You were saying.

58:44.666 --> 58:47.333
I know the mine
seems to be all I speak of these days.

58:48.291 --> 58:50.250
But Tevershall belongs to me.

58:52.041 --> 58:53.750
One day it will belong to an heir.

58:57.166 --> 58:58.583
And the mine needs our help.

58:59.625 --> 59:01.458
We must modernize.

59:01.958 --> 59:03.750
-You and me.

59:07.083 --> 59:08.500
<i>My dear sister…</i>

59:10.000 --> 59:12.500
<i>I've thought a lot about</i>
<i>what you said at the wedding.</i>

59:13.416 --> 59:15.375
<i>That I open my heart too easily.</i>

59:17.250 --> 59:19.625
<i>That may have been true before the war,</i>

59:20.958 --> 59:22.791
<i>but I don't think it is any longer.</i>

59:24.666 --> 59:27.125
<i>Lately, I've felt my heart</i>
<i>opening up again.</i>

59:28.250 --> 59:29.791
<i>Despite all warnings.</i>

59:31.333 --> 59:33.125
<i>-And I can assure you…</i>
<i>-Connie.</i>

59:33.208 --> 59:36.166
<i>-…nothing about it has been easy.</i>
-<i>Look at me.</i>

59:37.708 --> 59:38.875
<i> Look at me.</i>

59:41.500 --> 59:42.583
<i>Look at me.</i>

59:51.250 --> 59:53.166
-Lady Chatterley.

59:53.250 --> 59:56.166
-Your book!
-Oh, it's all right. Thank you.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:19.041
Joggety, joggety, jog.

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:21.208
Joggety, joggety, jog.

1:00:22.041 --> 1:00:24.208
-She's perfect.
-Don't let her fool you.

1:00:24.291 --> 1:00:26.791
That one's given us
a lot of sleepless nights.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:28.000
Bet it's all worth it.

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:31.958
Well, we're very happy
to have you, aren't we, Josephine?

1:00:32.541 --> 1:00:33.458
Aren't we?

1:00:33.541 --> 1:00:35.791
Clifford and I talked
about having a child one day.

1:00:35.875 --> 1:00:36.916
Have you?

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.916
Hmm. I mean, just because
he's lost the use of his legs,

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.625
doesn't mean we can't have children.

1:00:42.208 --> 1:00:44.541
-That's wonderful, isn't it?

1:00:45.083 --> 1:00:47.291
Josephine would love a new playmate.

1:00:47.875 --> 1:00:49.708
Would you?

1:00:50.208 --> 1:00:53.416
And being a mother,
I recommend it by all means.

1:00:55.125 --> 1:00:56.333
I lied to you.

1:00:56.416 --> 1:00:57.375
She's perfect.

1:01:01.791 --> 1:01:04.541
-What's the gamekeeper doing here?
-He comes each day for fresh milk.

1:01:04.625 --> 1:01:06.916
-Good day to you, Mr. Mellors.
-Mrs. Flint.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.041
-Lady Chatterley.

1:01:09.708 --> 1:01:12.041
-Would you, uh, keep an eye on her?
-Of course.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:17.041
-Josephine, hello.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:20.125
All right, tinker. What you got?

1:01:22.041 --> 1:01:23.875
Said you'd come to the cottage.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:25.000
I said I'd try.

1:01:26.375 --> 1:01:27.791
Will you come later?

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:38.500
What's this?

1:01:38.583 --> 1:01:39.583
What's this, then?

1:01:40.458 --> 1:01:42.666
-Here you are.
-Ta. Thank you.

1:01:43.208 --> 1:01:44.625
-I should go.
-Oh, all right.

1:01:44.708 --> 1:01:47.083
-Lovely to see you, Josephine.

1:01:47.708 --> 1:01:50.791
-Shall I walk you home?
-No. No, not necessary.

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:52.791
Um… Lovely to see you, Mrs. Flint.

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:54.708
-Do come again.
-I will.

1:01:59.916 --> 1:02:02.583
-Thanks again. Take care. Take care.

1:02:03.250 --> 1:02:05.500
Say bye. Say bye.

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:06.500
Bye.

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:13.875
Ayup!

1:02:16.416 --> 1:02:18.000
Giving me the slip like?

1:02:18.083 --> 1:02:19.291
What do you mean?

1:02:19.375 --> 1:02:20.291
Pardon?

1:02:20.375 --> 1:02:21.708
What do you mean?

1:02:22.458 --> 1:02:24.333
Well, you didn't come to the cottage.

1:02:25.541 --> 1:02:27.958
And the way
you pulled back from me just then.

1:02:28.041 --> 1:02:30.166
Mrs. Flint could have seen. Are you mad?

1:02:32.458 --> 1:02:33.791
Come to the cottage, then.

1:02:36.625 --> 1:02:37.541
No.

1:02:38.958 --> 1:02:40.916
By the time we get there,
it'll be too late.

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:50.375
Come through here.

1:02:58.500 --> 1:02:59.333
Come on.

1:03:13.875 --> 1:03:15.166
What? Here?

1:03:15.250 --> 1:03:16.916
Aye, milady.

1:03:18.333 --> 1:03:19.208
Right here.

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:25.541
-Don't call me that.
-You don't want to be a lady?

1:03:26.250 --> 1:03:27.166
Not with you.

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:31.916
You would want coarser treatment with me?

1:03:32.916 --> 1:03:33.750
Mm-hmm.

1:04:00.416 --> 1:04:01.375
Take this off.

1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:17.625
Undo my trousers.

1:04:34.916 --> 1:04:35.750
Yeah.

1:04:40.125 --> 1:04:41.833
-Lie down.
-Hmm?

1:04:41.916 --> 1:04:42.750
Lie down.

1:04:48.833 --> 1:04:49.708
No.

1:04:50.458 --> 1:04:52.250
No, don't turn away. Look at me.

1:04:59.583 --> 1:05:00.708
I want you to fuck me.

1:05:02.750 --> 1:05:03.958
You want me to fuck you?

1:05:04.750 --> 1:05:05.666
Yes.

1:05:44.541 --> 1:05:46.125
Yes. Yes.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:48.750
-Yes. That's it.

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:50.083
That's it, Connie.

1:06:37.833 --> 1:06:38.708
Hmm.

1:06:42.958 --> 1:06:44.958
We both came off together that time.

1:06:47.375 --> 1:06:49.375
-It's good when that happens.
-Hmm.

1:06:52.541 --> 1:06:55.708
Some people live their whole lives
and never know that feeling.

1:06:56.291 --> 1:06:57.750
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:07:00.666 --> 1:07:03.083
Is that the-- All right, yeah. Fuck knows.

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:10.625
Fuck.

1:07:13.541 --> 1:07:16.083
You're gonna have to help me, Connie.
Here you are.

1:07:30.583 --> 1:07:31.750
You know what you have?

1:07:35.916 --> 1:07:37.208
Tenderness.

1:07:40.333 --> 1:07:42.375
I… I didn't say you were gentle.

1:07:43.708 --> 1:07:45.208
I've had enough of gentlemen.

1:07:47.250 --> 1:07:49.708
-They're a different breed.
-How do you mean?

1:07:50.875 --> 1:07:51.750
Dead.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:53.916
Dead.

1:07:55.041 --> 1:07:59.416
You've got to…
cut them parts of you that feel off,

1:08:00.625 --> 1:08:02.708
if you're gonna send men into mines or…

1:08:03.625 --> 1:08:04.708
factories or…

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.500
into battle.

1:08:12.833 --> 1:08:14.750
Either that
or you live with what you've done.

1:08:17.416 --> 1:08:20.333
You're not like any man
I've… ever met before.

1:08:20.416 --> 1:08:22.041
You're not like any other woman.

1:08:22.958 --> 1:08:23.958
How?

1:08:33.291 --> 1:08:35.125
You are beautiful.

1:08:40.083 --> 1:08:44.166
You know, I don't think I… realized
how lonely I've been until now.

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:47.375
Thank you.

1:08:51.750 --> 1:08:52.833
You better go.

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:41.458
Ten of spades.
Well, I have got you there with the king.

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:45.500
-<i>I, Connie…</i>
-<i>I, Oliver…</i>

1:09:45.583 --> 1:09:48.125
<i>-…take you, Oliver…</i>
<i>-…take you, Connie…</i>

1:09:48.916 --> 1:09:50.875
<i>-…in strength…</i>
-<i>…and in freedom…</i>

1:09:51.625 --> 1:09:53.333
<i>…and in ecstasy.</i>

1:10:41.208 --> 1:10:42.708
-How deep is it?

1:10:46.458 --> 1:10:47.541
-Please.

1:10:52.458 --> 1:10:54.291
-"Why do I like you?"
-Mm-hmm.

1:10:55.458 --> 1:10:56.333
"Fruit is black."

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.458
Hmm.

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:44.916
Oh, Your Ladyship,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000
-I saw the light and--
-It's all right, honestly.

1:11:48.708 --> 1:11:52.458
Sit.
Be happy to have some company.

1:11:52.541 --> 1:11:53.416
Really.

1:11:55.208 --> 1:11:56.375
Why are you up so late?

1:11:56.875 --> 1:11:59.750
Uh, Sir Clifford,
he's not been sleeping.

1:11:59.833 --> 1:12:01.416
I can't help looking in on him.

1:12:02.916 --> 1:12:05.416
-Hmm.
-It was the same with me husband.

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:09.291
If he so much as got a cold,
I'd be up all night worrying over him.

1:12:09.375 --> 1:12:10.291
Ted.

1:12:11.583 --> 1:12:12.708
You must miss him.

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:14.833
Oh, it's been 25 years,

1:12:15.416 --> 1:12:18.125
but do you know, still sometimes in bed,

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:21.875
I'll wake up, and I think,
"He's not in bed with me."

1:12:23.291 --> 1:12:25.458
Oh, it's just the touch of him.

1:12:27.541 --> 1:12:28.375
Aye.

1:12:29.916 --> 1:12:31.083
It's amazing, isn't it?

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:33.791
How someone can get so into your blood.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.291
Oh, it is.

1:12:36.791 --> 1:12:38.083
It can make you bitter.

1:12:38.750 --> 1:12:41.916
If it hadn't been for that pit,
Ted'd still be here.

1:12:43.125 --> 1:12:44.875
He hated it down there.

1:12:44.958 --> 1:12:48.291
He hated it, but what could he do?
He was trapped.

1:12:51.083 --> 1:12:53.083
I suppose we all are in different ways.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:56.541
You never wanted to remarry?

1:12:56.625 --> 1:12:58.166
-Oh, Lord.

1:12:59.041 --> 1:13:00.208
Ted was the only one?

1:13:00.791 --> 1:13:01.625
He was.

1:13:02.666 --> 1:13:05.625
But you and your man,
you know, you grow together.

1:13:06.666 --> 1:13:08.583
Who else is there in life?

1:13:08.666 --> 1:13:11.625
Children, of course, but… Oh.

1:13:11.708 --> 1:13:13.875
-I'm sorry, that was thoughtless of me.
-No.

1:13:14.375 --> 1:13:15.916
Don't worry. It's fine.

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:18.250
Um…

1:13:19.041 --> 1:13:20.416
More than fine, actually.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:23.625
There still might
be some hope in that regard.

1:13:24.125 --> 1:13:26.083
-For you and Sir Clifford?
-Hmm.

1:13:26.833 --> 1:13:29.000
Doctor says his recovery is remarkable.

1:13:29.083 --> 1:13:30.041
So who knows?

1:13:30.541 --> 1:13:31.875
I might have a child yet.

1:13:37.083 --> 1:13:39.916
Well, I hope and pray that you do.

1:13:42.791 --> 1:13:44.416
Can I get you a blanket?

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.166
No, I'm fine, thank you.

1:13:47.125 --> 1:13:49.916
Sleep well. Save some secrets
for our next conversation.

1:13:51.375 --> 1:13:52.291
Good night.

1:14:05.083 --> 1:14:07.458
Come on now, you lass.

1:14:09.375 --> 1:14:11.250
I think we're best off outside.

1:14:22.041 --> 1:14:22.916
Come on.

1:15:07.375 --> 1:15:09.750
-There, there.

1:15:50.416 --> 1:15:52.500
Has Her Ladyship not risen yet?

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.666
-She got up before I did.
-Hmm.

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:57.083
She's already had her breakfast, then.

1:15:57.166 --> 1:15:59.333
Yes. She's out on one of her walks.

1:16:00.791 --> 1:16:02.958
I was up early myself.

1:16:03.666 --> 1:16:06.666
There were a lot of people out this morn.

1:16:06.750 --> 1:16:09.750
-The gamekeeper, he was--
-Could you get me some fresh cream?

1:16:12.291 --> 1:16:13.500
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

1:16:14.291 --> 1:16:16.750
-<i>Since Sir Clifford took over,</i>

1:16:16.833 --> 1:16:19.291
they've been working
the poor miners to the bone.

1:16:19.375 --> 1:16:22.208
I thought the machines
were supposed to make the work easier.

1:16:22.291 --> 1:16:24.708
It's a way to make
more money with fewer workers.

1:16:24.791 --> 1:16:26.833
Don't he have
enough money already?

1:16:26.916 --> 1:16:29.500
Oh, bet his lady
needs her baubles and silk

1:16:29.583 --> 1:16:31.583
so she can
lord her station over the rest of us.

1:16:31.666 --> 1:16:33.083
No, she's not like that.

1:16:33.166 --> 1:16:34.875
She treats folks who work with her

1:16:34.958 --> 1:16:37.458
with the same respect
she'd treat a lord or lady.

1:16:37.541 --> 1:16:39.541
My Lily says the same about her.

1:16:39.625 --> 1:16:41.208
Well, she deserves better then.

1:16:41.291 --> 1:16:43.166
Such a hard lot that's fallen to her.

1:16:43.833 --> 1:16:49.666
Oh! As it happens, uh, Sir Clifford
may not be quite as done in as we thought.

1:16:50.541 --> 1:16:54.791
Oh, his legs won't work again,
but, you know, rest might.

1:16:55.541 --> 1:16:59.625
Her Ladyship has even suggested
there might be a child one day soon.

1:16:59.708 --> 1:17:00.541
What?

1:17:00.625 --> 1:17:01.541
-No!

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:04.083
-That's amazing.
-You ever heard of such a thing?

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:06.166
How long
should these things last?

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:09.250
If we keep them
in good repair, for generations.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:13.583
Speaking of which, sir,
if you don't mind my asking,

1:17:13.666 --> 1:17:15.791
is there any truth to the rumor

1:17:15.875 --> 1:17:18.291
that we may
still have hope of an heir at Wragby?

1:17:19.250 --> 1:17:20.166
Are there rumors?

1:17:20.916 --> 1:17:21.958
Yes.

1:17:22.041 --> 1:17:24.375
Everyone's been asking me
what I know about it.

1:17:24.458 --> 1:17:28.041
I am happy to set the record straight
if the rumor's unfounded.

1:17:29.041 --> 1:17:29.958
Indeed.

1:17:30.916 --> 1:17:31.750
Well…

1:17:34.750 --> 1:17:35.958
there may yet be hope.

1:17:37.250 --> 1:17:38.250
Hello, Con.

1:17:40.083 --> 1:17:41.125
I've just had

1:17:41.208 --> 1:17:43.416
the most interesting meeting
with Mr. Linley.

1:17:44.291 --> 1:17:45.125
Hmm?

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:47.458
Have you heard the rumor

1:17:48.375 --> 1:17:50.500
that you are to supply Wragby
with an heir?

1:17:53.875 --> 1:17:54.875
No.

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:57.000
Is it a joke?

1:17:57.916 --> 1:17:59.875
I'd hoped it might be a prophecy.

1:18:03.375 --> 1:18:05.000
I received a letter from Father.

1:18:05.916 --> 1:18:08.625
He's been invited to Venice
for July and August

1:18:08.708 --> 1:18:12.041
and has asked me and Hilda
to come with him.

1:18:12.583 --> 1:18:13.583
July and August?

1:18:15.250 --> 1:18:17.125
I wouldn't need to go for that long.

1:18:17.208 --> 1:18:19.333
Three weeks
should be more than enough time

1:18:19.416 --> 1:18:20.541
for what we discussed.

1:18:22.750 --> 1:18:25.125
Have plans already been set in motion?

1:18:27.750 --> 1:18:28.666
Not just yet.

1:18:31.083 --> 1:18:33.791
If I were absolutely certain
you'd want to come back to me?

1:18:35.166 --> 1:18:36.125
Of course I would.

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.500
I don't want to know his name.

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:42.875
No one can.

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:54.958
Well, in that case, I think
it ought to be all right, don't you?

1:18:57.333 --> 1:18:58.291
Mm-hmm.

1:19:04.458 --> 1:19:07.666
You know how much
you mean to me, don't you?

1:19:09.958 --> 1:19:11.041
And you to me.

1:19:12.875 --> 1:19:14.416
I have to go away for a while.

1:19:15.416 --> 1:19:16.833
-Where?
-Venice.

1:19:18.583 --> 1:19:19.541
With Sir Clifford?

1:19:20.708 --> 1:19:22.666
-For how long?
-Just a couple of months.

1:19:22.750 --> 1:19:24.125
But no, not with Clifford.

1:19:24.208 --> 1:19:26.083
He doesn't like to travel how he is.

1:19:26.166 --> 1:19:27.000
Aye.

1:19:27.791 --> 1:19:28.916
The poor devil.

1:19:31.666 --> 1:19:33.750
-You won't forget about me.
-Forget?

1:19:33.833 --> 1:19:35.708
-Mm-hmm.
-You know nobody forgets.

1:19:36.958 --> 1:19:38.500
It's not a question of memory.

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:43.000
Look, um…

1:19:47.041 --> 1:19:49.791
I told Clifford I might have a child.

1:19:52.666 --> 1:19:53.625
You did?

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:59.541
I… I think I'm already… expecting.

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:09.333
Oliver?

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:14.750
What did he say?

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:17.875
Um…

1:20:18.375 --> 1:20:19.666
He said he'd be glad

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:23.458
as long as the child seemed to be his.

1:20:24.250 --> 1:20:27.958
So where does Sir Clifford suppose
that this child is coming from?

1:20:28.041 --> 1:20:32.041
-I said I might have an affair in Venice.
-You might. So that's why you're going.

1:20:32.125 --> 1:20:34.708
Not to have the affair.
Just the appearance of one.

1:20:37.541 --> 1:20:39.375
So that's why you wanted me then.

1:20:39.875 --> 1:20:40.958
To get a child.

1:20:42.291 --> 1:20:43.791
Of course not, Oliver.

1:20:44.666 --> 1:20:47.833
I never planned on you.
I never planned on any of this, really.

1:20:47.916 --> 1:20:50.916
What was the plan then, Connie?

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:52.458
What was the plan, really?

1:20:53.166 --> 1:20:54.500
-What was the plan?
-I--

1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.916
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.416
Well, then, I am damned if I do.

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:03.541
Fucking hell.

1:21:04.375 --> 1:21:06.166
Well, it's as Your Ladyship likes.

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:08.666
If you get a child,
Sir Clifford's welcome to it.

1:21:08.750 --> 1:21:10.208
I shan't have lost anything.

1:21:10.291 --> 1:21:12.583
On the contrary,
I've had a nice experience.

1:21:12.666 --> 1:21:15.166
-Don't talk like that.
-If you've made use of me,

1:21:15.250 --> 1:21:17.583
it's not the first time
I've been made use of, is it?

1:21:17.666 --> 1:21:20.083
I don't suppose
it's ever been as pleasant as this time.

1:21:20.166 --> 1:21:24.583
Of course, one can't feel
tremendously dignified about it.

1:21:25.166 --> 1:21:28.333
I didn't make use of you… Oliver.

1:21:28.416 --> 1:21:30.333
As Your Ladyship pleases.

1:21:34.083 --> 1:21:35.708
-You forgot your book.

1:21:35.791 --> 1:21:37.666
Or have you made use of that as well?

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:44.625
With the new generators,
we'll be able to reduce the workforce.

1:21:44.708 --> 1:21:47.458
-Striking will be impossible.
-What about the workers?

1:21:47.541 --> 1:21:50.083
No man's forced to work for me.
I'm not forced to hire them.

1:21:51.958 --> 1:21:54.791
-No wonder the men hate you.
-They don't hate me.

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:57.041
They depend on me.
They should be grateful.

1:21:57.125 --> 1:21:59.375
They'd starve
without someone to tend them.

1:21:59.458 --> 1:22:01.791
You talk about them
as if they're herd animals.

1:22:01.875 --> 1:22:02.833
Not all of them.

1:22:02.916 --> 1:22:05.416
An individual
may rise from the pack now and again.

1:22:05.500 --> 1:22:08.000
Most of those men
have been ruled since time began.

1:22:08.083 --> 1:22:09.333
And you can rule them?

1:22:09.416 --> 1:22:12.125
Yes, because I've been brought up
and trained to do so.

1:22:12.208 --> 1:22:14.791
That's my role in society,
as it's their place to serve.

1:22:14.875 --> 1:22:18.041
So there is no shared humanity between us?

1:22:18.125 --> 1:22:20.708
We all need to eat and breathe,
but beyond that, no.

1:22:21.833 --> 1:22:23.500
Shall we go as far as the spring?

1:22:24.833 --> 1:22:26.125
Good day to you, Mr. Mellors!

1:22:26.208 --> 1:22:27.541
-Ayuh.

1:22:36.708 --> 1:22:38.083
Wait, Clifford. I'll push.

1:22:38.166 --> 1:22:40.875
What's the use of the thing
if she needs to be pushed?

1:22:40.958 --> 1:22:43.625
-You're making it worse!
-Be quiet a moment, will you?

1:22:48.916 --> 1:22:49.958
Damn thing!

1:22:50.458 --> 1:22:52.083
-Wait, stop!

1:22:53.750 --> 1:22:55.375
-Mellors.

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:58.875
-Yes, Sir Clifford?
-Know anything about blasted motors?

1:22:58.958 --> 1:23:01.500
-I'm afraid not. Has she gone wrong?
-Apparently!

1:23:01.583 --> 1:23:03.916
Just have a look
and see that nothing's broken.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:14.916
No.

1:23:15.791 --> 1:23:18.000
Seems all right as far as I can see, sir.

1:23:18.083 --> 1:23:19.458
Then stand back.

1:23:23.208 --> 1:23:25.875
-Maybe if I give it a push.
-No. She'll do it herself.

1:23:33.125 --> 1:23:34.333
Yeah?

1:23:34.416 --> 1:23:36.583
-You see? Good.

1:23:37.125 --> 1:23:38.791
Are you pushing? I asked you not.

1:23:38.875 --> 1:23:41.291
-It won't go if I don't.
-Give it a chance, man!

1:23:45.416 --> 1:23:46.791
Clifford, watch your brake.

1:23:49.458 --> 1:23:51.291
-Right. Fine.
-Clifford!

1:23:57.083 --> 1:23:59.125
It's obvious
I'm at everybody's bloody mercy.

1:24:00.916 --> 1:24:04.958
It would seem, Mr. Mellors,
that she would need to be pushed.

1:24:06.708 --> 1:24:07.541
Do you mind?

1:24:07.625 --> 1:24:08.875
-Not at all, sir.
-Hmm.

1:24:10.541 --> 1:24:11.750
Right.

1:24:11.833 --> 1:24:13.416
-Hang on, hang on.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.541
-Two, three.

1:24:16.625 --> 1:24:17.708
Bombs away.

1:24:18.750 --> 1:24:20.500
-There we are.

1:24:21.875 --> 1:24:24.250
For God's sake, man,
what's the matter with you?

1:24:25.291 --> 1:24:29.208
Lungs are a bit knackered, sir.
Little souvenir from the war.

1:24:30.291 --> 1:24:31.916
What the hell are you doing?

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.291
-He needs my help, Clifford!
-God's sake.

1:24:36.041 --> 1:24:36.958
You all right?

1:24:59.125 --> 1:25:02.625
<i>I suppose the other chair</i>
<i>will need a new set of wheels.</i>

1:25:02.708 --> 1:25:04.291
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.041
I mean,
how can you treat someone like that?

1:25:07.125 --> 1:25:09.166
Who? The gamekeeper?

1:25:09.250 --> 1:25:10.958
He was injured in the war as well.

1:25:11.750 --> 1:25:15.541
I mean, if he was in that chair,
what would you have done to him?

1:25:15.625 --> 1:25:18.125
I find your comparison in very bad taste.

1:25:18.208 --> 1:25:21.791
I find your lack of common sympathy
to be in the worst taste imaginable.

1:25:22.583 --> 1:25:24.541
You and your ruling class.

1:25:24.625 --> 1:25:26.625
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

1:25:26.708 --> 1:25:29.625
You make people work
for £2 a week or starve.

1:25:29.708 --> 1:25:31.541
It's not ruling, Clifford.

1:25:32.625 --> 1:25:33.541
That's bullying.

1:25:48.958 --> 1:25:50.000
Come on in, then.

1:25:55.291 --> 1:25:56.208
I'm sorry.

1:25:57.208 --> 1:25:58.541
I'm sorry for hurting you.

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:06.000
I don't want you
for the sake of a child… Oliver.

1:26:08.791 --> 1:26:10.041
I just want you.

1:26:11.041 --> 1:26:12.041
All right?

1:26:13.083 --> 1:26:13.916
All right.

1:26:17.916 --> 1:26:22.583
But Clifford has to believe
that I tried to keep us together.

1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:24.666
That this was his idea,

1:26:25.916 --> 1:26:27.416
just all gone terribly wrong.

1:26:30.125 --> 1:26:32.708
For him to give me a divorce,
for us to be together,

1:26:34.250 --> 1:26:35.541
he needs to believe that.

1:26:37.291 --> 1:26:38.833
I just want to be with you.

1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:43.708
If that's what you want.

1:26:44.666 --> 1:26:47.666
It's not about wanting, Connie.
You know what I want.

1:26:50.250 --> 1:26:53.166
I've still got to get a divorce
from Bertha meself.

1:26:55.375 --> 1:26:56.708
What happened with Bertha?

1:26:59.166 --> 1:27:01.583
I went off to war,
she carried on with other men.

1:27:02.250 --> 1:27:04.125
And now she refuses to divorce me.

1:27:05.666 --> 1:27:07.875
-What about her other man?
-Ned?

1:27:07.958 --> 1:27:09.791
-Mm-hmm.
-He's a big baby of a fella.

1:27:10.416 --> 1:27:11.458
She bullies him.

1:27:12.125 --> 1:27:15.875
They both drink, he gets sent around here
to harass me for me war pension.

1:27:19.125 --> 1:27:20.833
Aye, let's dinna fight.

1:27:24.416 --> 1:27:25.375
I'm sorry.

1:27:29.041 --> 1:27:31.041
Why don't we just leave them all behind?

1:27:33.875 --> 1:27:34.833
Go to Australia.

1:27:36.333 --> 1:27:37.250
Go somewhere…

1:27:40.250 --> 1:27:41.166
Anywhere.

1:27:42.291 --> 1:27:44.250
-The three of us?
-Just our family.

1:27:48.291 --> 1:27:49.583
No one would judge us.

1:27:51.125 --> 1:27:54.583
Seems a wrong and bitter thing
to be bringing a child into this world.

1:27:56.916 --> 1:27:58.416
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

1:27:58.500 --> 1:28:00.458
-No.
-No, I mean this world here.

1:28:02.083 --> 1:28:03.458
I'm pleased for us.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.416
I'm pleased for you to be pleased.

1:28:09.375 --> 1:28:12.958
But when I think about around here,
what man has done to man…

1:28:14.833 --> 1:28:17.916
…what leaders of men
have done to their so-called fellow men.

1:28:19.833 --> 1:28:22.166
Reduced them to less than humanness.

1:28:22.250 --> 1:28:25.083
Half corpses
and they think about nowt but money.

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:28.541
Living to make money.

1:28:31.375 --> 1:28:34.375
But not all of us
have the freedom to live life how we want.

1:28:36.625 --> 1:28:38.333
Not all of us can do as we--

1:28:39.916 --> 1:28:40.750
Connie.

1:28:42.625 --> 1:28:43.666
What are you doing?

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.875
Whoo!

1:29:11.083 --> 1:29:12.458
Whoo!

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:16.333
Come on!

1:29:18.708 --> 1:29:20.916
Whoo!

1:30:17.291 --> 1:30:19.333
Where is she? She's been gone for hours.

1:30:19.416 --> 1:30:22.041
Well, I'm sure
it's just the rain that's keeping her.

1:30:22.125 --> 1:30:24.291
She's… she's probably sheltering
in the hut.

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:27.583
-I'll send Warren and Betts to find her.
-No, don't you do that.

1:30:27.666 --> 1:30:29.166
It'll only get people talking.

1:30:29.250 --> 1:30:31.750
I'll slip over to the hut
and, uh, see if she's there.

1:30:31.833 --> 1:30:34.791
-What? And leave me here alone?
-Oh, don't you worry.

1:30:35.583 --> 1:30:37.083
We'll be back in no time.

1:30:40.125 --> 1:30:41.500
-Ayup.
-Ayup.

1:30:41.583 --> 1:30:43.791
-Ayup, me duck.
-Ayup, me duck.

1:30:49.208 --> 1:30:50.791
I leave for Venice on Thursday.

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.833
I'll come by the cottage that night.

1:31:11.041 --> 1:31:12.125
Milady?

1:31:18.416 --> 1:31:20.416
Oh, milady, there you are.

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:24.375
Sir Clifford asked me to look for you.
He was worried something had happened.

1:31:24.458 --> 1:31:27.666
No. No, I was sheltering
in the hut from the rain.

1:31:28.416 --> 1:31:29.333
Mrs. Bolton.

1:31:30.083 --> 1:31:32.500
Your Ladyship would be
quite all right from here.

1:31:33.166 --> 1:31:35.833
Good evening to you.
Good evening to you, Your Ladyship.

1:31:38.958 --> 1:31:42.125
I am not a child.
It's monstrous that I have to be followed.

1:31:42.208 --> 1:31:44.291
My Ladyship, don't say that.

1:31:44.375 --> 1:31:47.250
Sir Clifford was sure
you'd been struck by lightning.

1:31:47.833 --> 1:31:50.541
It's not your fault.
It's foolish of Clifford to worry.

1:31:52.333 --> 1:31:53.875
Well, let's go home now.

1:31:55.791 --> 1:31:57.625
And I'll take care of the rest.

1:32:04.208 --> 1:32:06.458
You don't need
to send the servants out after me.

1:32:06.541 --> 1:32:08.166
God, where have you been?

1:32:08.250 --> 1:32:10.666
You've been gone out hours,
and in a storm like this.

1:32:10.750 --> 1:32:12.083
What have you been doing?

1:32:12.166 --> 1:32:15.583
What if I choose not to tell you?
I went to the hut and lit a fire.

1:32:15.666 --> 1:32:20.375
-Look at you. The state of your hair.
-I went out into the rain… naked.

1:32:22.333 --> 1:32:23.708
Are you mad?

1:32:24.750 --> 1:32:27.541
Suppose Mellors had seen you
while you were prancing with nothing on.

1:32:27.625 --> 1:32:30.000
Yes… suppose he had.

1:32:31.583 --> 1:32:34.708
You're right, Clifford.
I should really go and get cleaned up.

1:32:37.333 --> 1:32:38.500
Connie!

1:32:57.458 --> 1:32:58.958
My sister's here!

1:33:01.583 --> 1:33:02.500
Hilda.

1:33:02.583 --> 1:33:04.875
-It's so good to see you.
-It's been too long.

1:33:06.875 --> 1:33:08.125
Good to see you.

1:33:09.625 --> 1:33:11.708
You know I've met someone,
don't you?

1:33:13.208 --> 1:33:15.125
I gathered from your letters, yes.

1:33:16.083 --> 1:33:19.208
I tried to tell myself it was nothing.
I tried to stay away. I did.

1:33:19.791 --> 1:33:21.458
But I can't.

1:33:21.541 --> 1:33:22.416
He…

1:33:23.250 --> 1:33:24.375
I really love him.

1:33:25.125 --> 1:33:26.625
-Wow.
-And-- I know.

1:33:27.333 --> 1:33:29.958
And I said I would stay with him tonight.
I promised.

1:33:30.041 --> 1:33:32.166
Are you going to tell me who he is?

1:33:32.250 --> 1:33:33.291
Oliver Mellors.

1:33:33.958 --> 1:33:35.125
He's our gamekeeper.

1:33:38.791 --> 1:33:41.708
No, Hilda. He's lovely.

1:33:42.666 --> 1:33:45.625
Honestly, he has
such an understanding and tenderness.

1:33:45.708 --> 1:33:47.666
He's quite the exception, you'll see.

1:33:49.166 --> 1:33:51.250
I long hoped you would find someone else.

1:33:52.250 --> 1:33:55.041
-But one of Clifford's servants?
-I'm not giving him up!

1:33:55.125 --> 1:33:58.958
Listen to you. It's you
and that German boy all over again.

1:33:59.041 --> 1:34:01.958
-It's not, Hilda! It's nothing like that!
-Yes, it is!

1:34:02.041 --> 1:34:04.916
Confusing sex with love,
and then thinking it can continue

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.625
just because it's what you want.

1:34:07.208 --> 1:34:11.250
Please, come to Venice and take the time
to think through what you really want.

1:34:11.333 --> 1:34:12.916
I know what I want!

1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:13.916
-Really?
-Yes!

1:34:15.041 --> 1:34:18.333
And I'm seeing him tonight
or I'm not going to Venice. I can't!

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:21.583
I really thought that you,
of all people, would understand!

1:34:28.541 --> 1:34:29.500
Goodbye.

1:34:29.583 --> 1:34:31.583
-Bye.
-I look forward to your letters.

1:34:33.833 --> 1:34:36.750
You have a good time,
and then come back and cheer us up.

1:34:37.250 --> 1:34:38.458
I will. Take care.

1:34:44.916 --> 1:34:46.083
Oliver.

1:34:46.166 --> 1:34:48.000
This is my sister, Hilda.

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.875
-Hello.
-Hilda, this is Oliver Mellors.

1:34:51.958 --> 1:34:53.458
-Hello.
-Pleasure to meet you.

1:34:55.625 --> 1:34:56.708
Take a seat then.

1:35:07.083 --> 1:35:07.958
Hilda.

1:35:09.125 --> 1:35:10.500
What do you want me to say?

1:35:11.958 --> 1:35:13.541
Whatever it is you're thinking.

1:35:14.625 --> 1:35:15.541
Very well.

1:35:17.125 --> 1:35:19.541
It is one thing
to hold trysts in your cottage,

1:35:20.791 --> 1:35:23.166
but what happens
when you go out into the world?

1:35:24.708 --> 1:35:27.083
When Connie's friends
cross the street to avoid her.

1:35:27.166 --> 1:35:28.208
That's not fair.

1:35:29.083 --> 1:35:31.375
She's got me figured out, then, eh?

1:35:32.708 --> 1:35:35.500
What summed me up so quick?
Were it summat I said?

1:35:36.791 --> 1:35:37.666
Mr. Mellors.

1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.375
How do you expect to take care of her
once you've lost your job?

1:35:43.833 --> 1:35:46.958
Do you actually believe
you can give her a chance at happiness?

1:35:47.583 --> 1:35:49.708
Oh, you're asking the wrong person there.

1:35:50.500 --> 1:35:53.083
All I know is I get
a great deal of happiness from her.

1:35:53.166 --> 1:35:56.041
-Thought of your own happiness at least.
-Hilda, enough!

1:35:56.875 --> 1:35:59.208
I think you understand
far better than she does

1:35:59.291 --> 1:36:01.208
how badly this could end, Mr. Mellors.

1:36:03.458 --> 1:36:05.666
Think about how much
she really means to you.

1:36:08.500 --> 1:36:10.833
I'll pick you up
in the morning, Connie. Early.

1:36:11.833 --> 1:36:12.958
Don't keep me waiting.

1:36:13.750 --> 1:36:15.208
-Mr. Mellors.
-Hilda.

1:36:20.833 --> 1:36:23.958
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have brought her.

1:36:28.458 --> 1:36:30.041
Please don't let her upset you.

1:36:31.416 --> 1:36:32.541
She's just protective.

1:36:33.625 --> 1:36:34.916
She's right.

1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.416
We haven't thought
beyond tomorrow, have we?

1:36:41.625 --> 1:36:43.708
Sir Clifford will fight this divorce.

1:36:43.791 --> 1:36:45.875
He'll fight to keep our child.

1:37:03.125 --> 1:37:06.125
I never had to think about these things
until you turned up.

1:37:15.750 --> 1:37:16.666
Let's go upstairs.

1:38:20.791 --> 1:38:22.916
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.250
-Yes.

1:39:19.583 --> 1:39:21.583
The fuck are you playing at, Ned?

1:39:21.666 --> 1:39:25.041
Calm down, Mellors.
I'm not here to fight. Bertha sent me.

1:39:25.125 --> 1:39:26.541
She's your problem now.

1:39:27.125 --> 1:39:27.958
Not mine.

1:39:28.041 --> 1:39:29.250
Ain't how she sees it.

1:39:30.041 --> 1:39:33.333
She's still your wife,
entitled to half your military pension.

1:39:33.416 --> 1:39:36.375
Aye, and I'm entitled to a divorce.
I won't get one, will I?

1:39:38.916 --> 1:39:40.458
-Fuck off, then.

1:39:40.541 --> 1:39:42.750
-All right. I'm going.

1:39:43.875 --> 1:39:44.791
I'm going.

1:39:50.958 --> 1:39:51.875
Is he gone?

1:39:52.500 --> 1:39:54.625
Unless his heart's just given out running.

1:39:56.291 --> 1:39:58.000
Stay there till we know he's gone.

1:40:06.666 --> 1:40:09.166
-Oh, what is she thinking?

1:40:11.708 --> 1:40:12.750
Go on.

1:40:33.958 --> 1:40:35.041
Connie.

1:41:15.750 --> 1:41:17.458
For heaven's sake, Connie.

1:41:18.041 --> 1:41:21.750
We're going to Venice tomorrow.
Do you have to look so miserable?

1:41:27.541 --> 1:41:28.625
I think I'm pregnant.

1:41:31.291 --> 1:41:32.125
Oh.

1:41:33.541 --> 1:41:34.375
Right.

1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:37.500
I assume it's not Clifford's.

1:41:38.666 --> 1:41:39.500
No.

1:41:41.416 --> 1:41:46.666
Although, he did say he would be happy
for me to have a child with another man.

1:41:47.333 --> 1:41:49.166
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:51.791
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

1:41:51.875 --> 1:41:52.750
It's all right.

1:41:52.833 --> 1:41:54.041
What exactly?

1:41:55.875 --> 1:41:56.708
What's happened?

1:42:00.250 --> 1:42:01.500
I'm in love with someone

1:42:02.750 --> 1:42:03.791
other than Clifford.

1:42:05.166 --> 1:42:06.375
So you've taken a lover?

1:42:07.166 --> 1:42:08.416
Well, good.

1:42:09.333 --> 1:42:10.291
Do I know the man?

1:42:10.791 --> 1:42:12.750
No.

1:42:13.666 --> 1:42:19.041
But I think I…
want a divorce from Clifford.

1:42:20.125 --> 1:42:22.583
Because of your feelings
for this other man?

1:42:25.541 --> 1:42:30.041
Well, if you want my opinion…

1:42:31.416 --> 1:42:35.583
I'm sorry, but you stand to gain
very little by breaking things off.

1:42:36.250 --> 1:42:37.541
Feelings come and go.

1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.666
You may love one man this year
and another the next,

1:42:40.750 --> 1:42:42.541
but the world will go on.

1:42:43.833 --> 1:42:45.666
And Wragby will go on standing.

1:42:49.083 --> 1:42:50.250
Please yourself,

1:42:51.083 --> 1:42:52.458
but stick by Wragby.

1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:55.416
And Wragby will stick by you.

1:42:58.416 --> 1:43:00.083
Let's go to Venice, shall we?

1:43:47.041 --> 1:43:50.166
He comes back home
thinking he's better than the lot of us.

1:43:50.666 --> 1:43:53.958
Gets the world to think poor Bertha's
to blame for all their trouble,

1:43:54.041 --> 1:43:55.875
and then he refuses to support her.

1:43:56.375 --> 1:43:57.958
-Bloody disgrace.
-I know.

1:43:58.625 --> 1:44:01.958
Bertha goes to the cottage today,
trying to patch things up.

1:44:02.041 --> 1:44:02.916
Makes sense.

1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000
She found
them silk nightclothes in the fire.

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.666
No wonder he keeps to himself.
He's hiding a woman in there.

1:44:08.750 --> 1:44:10.958
Lady Chatterley
loans her gamekeeper a book,

1:44:11.041 --> 1:44:14.000
and she's accused of…
Sorry, that's outrageous.

1:44:14.083 --> 1:44:16.708
Of course it is. I won't breathe
another word on the subject.

1:44:16.791 --> 1:44:19.375
Everyone's talking about it.
You know how people gossip.

1:44:19.458 --> 1:44:22.083
Sir, no one
wants to have this conversation,

1:44:22.166 --> 1:44:23.166
but we must.

1:44:23.791 --> 1:44:25.875
And of course,
it's pure nonsense.

1:44:25.958 --> 1:44:28.833
But your gamekeeper
seems to inspire all manner of rumors.

1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:31.750
The sooner you pack him off, the better.

1:44:31.833 --> 1:44:33.833
I appreciate
you coming to me with this.

1:44:33.916 --> 1:44:35.291
Your concerns are noted.

1:44:44.416 --> 1:44:45.375
Hello…

1:44:46.375 --> 1:44:48.291
I'd like a London number, please.

1:44:49.458 --> 1:44:50.625
<i>Lady Chatterley.</i>

1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:02.208
-Ayuh, Mrs. Bolton.
-Good day.

1:45:02.791 --> 1:45:04.791
I hear Sir Clifford's asking for me.

1:45:04.875 --> 1:45:06.833
Of course, yes. He's in his study.

1:45:06.916 --> 1:45:07.958
Right, aye.

1:45:08.833 --> 1:45:09.875
Mr. Mellors.

1:45:10.458 --> 1:45:12.750
I called Her Ladyship,
and she's coming back.

1:45:13.958 --> 1:45:15.583
-When?
-This evening.

1:45:15.666 --> 1:45:17.458
As soon as she can get here.

1:45:17.541 --> 1:45:20.375
She said you could meet at the hut
and decide what to do.

1:45:25.083 --> 1:45:25.916
There's…

1:45:27.583 --> 1:45:30.583
There's dark days coming, Mrs. Bolton.

1:45:32.166 --> 1:45:33.791
Best to steer clear from it all.

1:45:40.791 --> 1:45:41.666
Come in.

1:45:53.666 --> 1:45:54.625
You are my servant,

1:45:56.166 --> 1:45:58.708
living upon my land at my sole discretion,

1:46:00.291 --> 1:46:03.500
and now your indecencies
have become the subject of gossip.

1:46:05.458 --> 1:46:07.583
You should
shut the mouths of the gossips--

1:46:07.666 --> 1:46:10.458
Are you aware that Lady Chatterley's
name has been slandered?

1:46:10.958 --> 1:46:14.083
Apparently, her name was inscribed
in a book found at the cottage.

1:46:18.250 --> 1:46:20.458
I've got a picture of Queen Mary
on me wall calendar.

1:46:20.541 --> 1:46:22.375
I suppose she's in my harem as well.

1:46:22.458 --> 1:46:26.041
I do not appreciate your sarcasm, Mellors.

1:46:28.208 --> 1:46:29.833
You have until the end of today,

1:46:30.833 --> 1:46:33.750
after which time I never want to see you
set foot upon my land again.

1:46:33.833 --> 1:46:35.625
-Do I make myself clear?
-Oh, perfectly.

1:46:36.333 --> 1:46:37.666
I better get packing then.

1:46:51.625 --> 1:46:54.291
Mrs. Flint. Mrs. Flint, excuse me.

1:46:54.375 --> 1:46:56.875
-I have to get Josephine to bed.
-I know you've heard things.

1:46:56.958 --> 1:47:00.333
Please, I can't do this.
We lease this farm from Sir Clifford.

1:47:00.416 --> 1:47:01.416
And you always will.

1:47:01.500 --> 1:47:04.541
You met him here, didn't you?
The day he came to get milk?

1:47:04.625 --> 1:47:06.875
-I thought you'd come to see us.
-Of course I did.

1:47:06.958 --> 1:47:09.041
I found where you
parked the car in the trees.

1:47:09.125 --> 1:47:12.000
-No, that was one time.
-I don't want to know.

1:47:13.750 --> 1:47:15.291
Good evening, Lady Chatterley.

1:47:42.125 --> 1:47:44.875
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1:47:46.625 --> 1:47:47.541
Oliver.

1:47:50.458 --> 1:47:52.916
The cat is well and truly
out of the bag now, Connie.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.291
Everybody's talking.

1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.125
I've been sacked.

1:47:56.208 --> 1:47:59.250
You cannot be seen here, Connie.
You need to be in Venice.

1:47:59.333 --> 1:48:03.125
-But we could just leave together. Now.
-Look at me.

1:48:03.208 --> 1:48:04.583
I have nothing to give you.

1:48:04.666 --> 1:48:07.916
I've no job. I've no home.
I've no purpose in life. Nothing.

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:08.958
Don't say that.

1:48:09.041 --> 1:48:10.625
You are everything to me.

1:48:12.750 --> 1:48:13.625
Mellors!

1:48:15.958 --> 1:48:17.166
You need to go!

1:48:23.500 --> 1:48:25.083
-Look at me.
-Shh.

1:48:25.666 --> 1:48:28.375
Promise me, promise me
we'll share our lives.

1:48:29.208 --> 1:48:30.791
-Aye.
-Promise.

1:48:30.875 --> 1:48:32.625
Aye, me lass.

1:48:32.708 --> 1:48:34.125
When the time comes.

1:48:35.041 --> 1:48:36.166
When the time comes.

1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:40.500
-Mellors!
-Oh…

1:48:41.750 --> 1:48:44.666
Ayuh, can I grab me coat, mate, or…

1:49:10.041 --> 1:49:11.083
I'll find you.

1:49:12.666 --> 1:49:14.458
Wherever you are, I'll find you.

1:50:10.916 --> 1:50:13.833
-My Ladyship, you shouldn't be here.
-No, Mrs. Bolton.

1:50:18.333 --> 1:50:19.250
Connie.

1:50:25.875 --> 1:50:26.791
It's all true.

1:50:31.666 --> 1:50:32.916
Why would you do this?

1:50:34.666 --> 1:50:37.666
-It was your idea.
-My idea? No, no, no.

1:50:38.666 --> 1:50:41.125
Clifford, you knew perfectly well
what I was getting into.

1:50:41.208 --> 1:50:44.375
With the right sort of man.
I said the right sort!

1:50:44.458 --> 1:50:47.958
Oliver Mellors is a better person
than anyone I've ever met.

1:50:48.958 --> 1:50:50.583
I was perfectly clear, Connie.

1:50:51.166 --> 1:50:53.833
-We discussed the rules.
-I'm going to have his child.

1:50:53.916 --> 1:50:54.916
You're going to--

1:50:57.708 --> 1:50:58.625
You're sure?

1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.416
But… everybody knows.

1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:06.958
You can't possibly expect me
to claim that child as mine now.

1:51:07.041 --> 1:51:07.875
No, I…

1:51:09.416 --> 1:51:10.250
I don't.

1:51:12.541 --> 1:51:13.375
I don't.

1:51:16.250 --> 1:51:18.250
I want a divorce, Clifford.

1:51:20.958 --> 1:51:21.791
I'm leaving you.

1:51:24.458 --> 1:51:25.416
No. No, you can't.

1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:28.958
Look, I'm… I'm so sorry
about how this has all turned out,

1:51:29.041 --> 1:51:31.208
but we both know that this… marriage

1:51:31.291 --> 1:51:33.666
has been very unhappy
for a very long time now.

1:51:33.750 --> 1:51:35.666
It hasn't been.
It hasn't been. Not for me.

1:51:35.750 --> 1:51:36.791
Well, yes.

1:51:37.750 --> 1:51:39.500
Because you laid out all the rules.

1:51:41.208 --> 1:51:42.916
And I tried to follow them.

1:51:45.041 --> 1:51:48.333
I tried to support you
in every way I could.

1:51:50.541 --> 1:51:53.083
But you gave me
nothing in return.

1:51:54.166 --> 1:51:57.500
Not the slightest drop
of affection or kindness.

1:51:57.583 --> 1:52:01.750
And what's worse, you made me feel ashamed
for even wanting those things.

1:52:01.833 --> 1:52:04.083
I've always cared for you, Connie.

1:52:04.166 --> 1:52:05.500
Yes, cared for me.

1:52:06.208 --> 1:52:09.375
In the same way you care
for your books and for your radio,

1:52:09.458 --> 1:52:12.083
but never in the ways I need you to.

1:52:12.166 --> 1:52:14.333
I love you, Connie.

1:52:16.500 --> 1:52:18.583
I've loved you the only way I know how.

1:52:19.833 --> 1:52:23.500
I've given you everything
I know how to give.

1:52:27.958 --> 1:52:28.958
It's not enough.

1:52:29.666 --> 1:52:31.125
Then talk to me, Con.

1:52:33.208 --> 1:52:34.458
Help me understand.

1:52:35.833 --> 1:52:39.375
Show me how I can prove to you how I feel.

1:52:43.458 --> 1:52:44.375
Let me go.

1:52:47.166 --> 1:52:48.083
Please.

1:52:49.166 --> 1:52:50.250
Let me go.

1:52:55.083 --> 1:52:55.916
Go.

1:52:56.833 --> 1:52:57.708
Though know this.

1:52:58.791 --> 1:53:02.125
I will never grant you your divorce.

1:53:04.416 --> 1:53:05.916
Because you broke your word.

1:53:07.541 --> 1:53:11.458
Because you've made a mockery
of my life here in Wragby.

1:53:13.750 --> 1:53:17.541
I am not inclined
to give you anything ever again.

1:53:21.916 --> 1:53:23.708
I don't think you ever really were.

1:53:43.875 --> 1:53:44.791
Milady.

1:53:45.958 --> 1:53:46.916
Uh…

1:53:48.750 --> 1:53:51.250
I wasn't meaning to pry,
but I worried about you.

1:53:52.750 --> 1:53:54.333
I'm all right.

1:53:57.791 --> 1:53:58.708
Listen.

1:53:59.916 --> 1:54:02.208
You have no idea where Mellors has gone?

1:54:02.291 --> 1:54:03.208
No.

1:54:04.750 --> 1:54:09.291
Would you ask your friends
to let you know if they hear any news?

1:54:11.166 --> 1:54:12.916
And why shall I say I'm asking?

1:54:14.791 --> 1:54:15.791
Because I love him.

1:54:17.333 --> 1:54:19.375
-Tell them that.
-Yes, milady.

1:54:21.125 --> 1:54:22.000
Milady…

1:54:25.166 --> 1:54:27.750
I do hope you find your gentleman.

1:54:31.583 --> 1:54:32.916
Thank you, Mrs. Bolton.

1:54:34.541 --> 1:54:35.416
So do I.

1:54:36.583 --> 1:54:38.125
So do I.

1:55:54.208 --> 1:55:55.750
<i>It's all true, then?</i>

1:55:56.458 --> 1:55:58.208
<i>Has Her Ladyship left Sir Clifford?</i>

1:55:59.708 --> 1:56:01.083
Her Ladyship has asked

1:56:01.833 --> 1:56:04.666
that you will pass along
any news of Mr. Mellors.

1:56:06.416 --> 1:56:08.750
"'Cause I love him," she said.

1:56:09.666 --> 1:56:12.083
She gave up everything for him.

1:56:12.166 --> 1:56:15.708
Her title, her wealth,
her position in the world.

1:56:16.208 --> 1:56:17.458
Now she's lost him.

1:56:21.625 --> 1:56:24.250
I'll not hear a word spoken against them.

1:56:26.500 --> 1:56:27.833
This is a love story.

1:57:37.458 --> 1:57:39.708
This place is losing its charm,
don't you think?

1:57:39.791 --> 1:57:40.625
What?

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.208
Let's go back to London.

1:57:45.416 --> 1:57:46.291
All right.

1:57:51.333 --> 1:57:53.666
I'm Connie Reid. I don't think we met.

1:57:54.375 --> 1:57:55.666
Have a lovely evening.

1:58:10.125 --> 1:58:12.083
How many times have you read that page?

1:58:13.208 --> 1:58:14.125
What?

1:58:15.916 --> 1:58:19.291
Well… it looks as though he's found you.

1:58:30.041 --> 1:58:31.791
-Oh my God.
-Yes.

1:58:34.541 --> 1:58:36.500
You'll want my car again, I imagine.

1:58:45.166 --> 1:58:48.291
<i>You'll be impressed to learn</i>
<i>that word of your departure from Wragby</i>

1:58:48.375 --> 1:58:50.958
<i>has made it all the way</i>
<i>to my little village in Scotland.</i>

1:58:52.083 --> 1:58:56.166
<i>A man came to work in the local mines,</i>
<i>brought the tale with him,</i>

1:58:56.250 --> 1:58:59.833
<i>telling everyone in the pub</i>
<i>about a lady who fell for a hired man</i>

1:58:59.916 --> 1:59:03.541
<i>and didn't care if the world knew it</i>
<i>because… she loved him.</i>

1:59:05.625 --> 1:59:07.291
<i>Names weren't used, of course.</i>

1:59:11.416 --> 1:59:13.166
<i>I was simply "the gamekeeper."</i>

1:59:14.125 --> 1:59:15.583
<i>You were the "Lady in love."</i>

1:59:17.583 --> 1:59:21.083
Excuse me, I'm looking for Oliver Mellors.

1:59:21.166 --> 1:59:22.708
Do you… Do you know him?

1:59:22.791 --> 1:59:23.916
Oh yes, I do.

1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:25.083
He's down that road.

1:59:26.625 --> 1:59:28.625
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1:59:31.208 --> 1:59:33.625
<i>It was a good story,</i>
<i>and I found myself wondering</i>

1:59:33.708 --> 1:59:35.750
<i>if there might be more to the tale.</i>

1:59:37.250 --> 1:59:40.083
<i>A feller I knew from the army</i>
<i>got me work at a farm here.</i>

1:59:40.958 --> 1:59:42.125
<i>Thirty shillings a week</i>

1:59:42.208 --> 1:59:44.500
<i>and decent lodgings</i>
<i>in a cottage up the road.</i>

1:59:47.166 --> 1:59:48.583
<i>I thought I needed a purpose</i>

1:59:48.666 --> 1:59:51.000
<i>before bringing you</i>
<i>and a child into my life.</i>

1:59:53.041 --> 1:59:56.541
<i>I can't say I've found</i>
<i>any greater meaning here on the farm,</i>

1:59:58.958 --> 2:00:00.083
<i>but I've made a home.</i>

2:00:04.250 --> 2:00:06.833
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what you've already been through</i>

2:00:06.916 --> 2:00:08.791
<i>and how much you've already given up.</i>

2:00:09.791 --> 2:00:12.500
<i>You'd be giving up even more</i>
<i>to come live here with me,</i>

2:00:13.541 --> 2:00:14.375
<i>but…</i>

2:00:14.958 --> 2:00:15.875
Oliver!

2:00:19.750 --> 2:00:22.500
<i>…what we have… together</i>

2:00:23.875 --> 2:00:26.125
<i>is different than anything</i>
<i>I've ever known.</i>

2:00:33.500 --> 2:00:36.250
<i>There's a little flame between us.</i>
<i>It's always burning.</i>

2:00:38.166 --> 2:00:41.416
<i>And I've come to believe</i>
<i>that tending a fire like that is…</i>

2:00:42.083 --> 2:00:43.708
<i>purpose enough for any life.</i>
