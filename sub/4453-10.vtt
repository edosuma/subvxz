That's right, I have no comment.

37:06.325 --> 37:10.994
"Union Pacific president pays out $50,000
for role in fraudulent land scheme."

37:11.364 --> 37:13.064
There was no fraud.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.967
The board decided to move the
hub without my knowledge.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.601
Then why pay the money?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.870
It's time you went back to your seat.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.540
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

37:31.083 --> 37:33.217
Look. Get out of my car now.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.130
Hey! What...

37:51.202 --> 37:52.267

38:18.194 --> 38:19.328
LOUISE: No!

38:19.329 --> 38:21.596
THOMAS: Oh, God.

38:25.502 --> 38:26.501
No.

38:27.104 --> 38:28.103
Stop!

38:29.372 --> 38:30.672
I'm the one you want.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.273
Take me.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.009
Please!

38:36.146 --> 38:37.178

(DOOR OPENS)

39:55.089 --> 39:56.755
(CHIMES TINKLING)

40:12.239 --> 40:13.371
Leg sore?

40:14.674 --> 40:15.673
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

40:18.478 --> 40:19.477
Leg sore.

40:32.225 --> 40:33.724
Every step of my life,

40:38.831 --> 40:40.765
I lost everybody I ever had.

40:47.339 --> 40:49.105
All I got left is scars.

40:59.618 --> 41:02.986
Father say when this box empty,

41:04.322 --> 41:07.556
we leave Gold Mountain and go home.

41:13.698 --> 41:15.665
Last leaf inside for two years.

41:23.341 --> 41:25.040
I never take it out.

(SIGHS)

41:53.503 --> 41:54.736
(CHIMES TINKLING)

41:55.238 --> 41:58.012
(IN CANTONESE) Ah-Fong, I have
your father's payment.

42:05.615 --> 42:09.350
I want the rest of men trained
on nitro by the end of the week.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.886
- You hear me?
- Mmm.

42:12.521 --> 42:13.520
You.

42:14.523 --> 42:18.259
Any of them have a problem,
find me ones who don't.

42:21.965 --> 42:23.055
(IN CANTONESE) My money?

42:26.725 --> 42:28.112
