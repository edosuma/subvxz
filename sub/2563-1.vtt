01:24.127 --> 01:25.462
Coffee?

01:32.302 --> 01:34.137
All right, freeze!

01:34.263 --> 01:35.847
One move
and you're both dead men.

01:36.473 --> 01:37.683
You hear me, asshole?

01:38.809 --> 01:42.229
- This something new for you, son?
- Shut up! Shut your goddamn mouth!

01:42.354 --> 01:45.065
Hey, fine, no problem.
There's the cash register.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.150
And right up there
is the television camera.

01:47.276 --> 01:49.778
And there's a nice full-face shot.
How about a profile?

01:53.240 --> 01:55.880
- There's a couple of ways we can do this.
- I told you to shut up.

01:55.951 --> 01:58.495
Fine. I'm just saying
you got to think things through.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.247
You don't just walk into someplace,

02:00.372 --> 02:03.375
waving a gun around,
and expect the world to put up with that.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.460
- It's not acceptable behaviour.
- Yeah?

02:05.586 --> 02:07.838
- Are you gonna stop me?
- Hell, no.

02:07.963 --> 02:09.381
Go right ahead.

02:10.716 --> 02:12.342
You probably got a minute or two.

02:15.304 --> 02:16.597
Maybe you don't.

02:18.807 --> 02:20.601
Just trying to help you, son.

02:29.109 --> 02:31.194
That boy's got a bad attitude.

05:18.862 --> 05:20.030
Damn it!

06:48.535 --> 06:50.120
Hold it right there!

06:51.913 --> 06:54.082
Hey, Quint!

07:19.566 --> 07:21.067
You know that guy?

07:45.383 --> 07:49.596
'Check your readings.'
I'm watching.

07:51.681 --> 07:52.849
Standing by.

07:56.478 --> 07:58.563
Secondary boost, check.

07:58.688 --> 08:00.523
'Pressure steady.
Activate stage one.'

08:00.649 --> 08:01.816
Approaching red levels.

08:04.152 --> 08:06.154
- 'Stage two confirmed.'
- Looking good.

08:11.576 --> 08:13.203
Feels hot. Here goes!

08:17.165 --> 08:19.125
Yee-ha-ha!

08:27.217 --> 08:29.052
That's it! That's it.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.286
Billy, 325!

08:55.412 --> 08:57.497
Yee-ha!

09:00.083 --> 09:04.212
'Gunfire erupted last night
at the offices of the Lucky Dollar Corp.

09:04.337 --> 09:08.091
'A guard shot it out with the burglar
who escaped apparently empty-handed.

09:08.216 --> 09:11.970
'Lucky Dollar Corp is currently
the object of a Federal Grand Jury probe

09:12.095 --> 09:14.347
'looking into possible
racketeering and tax...'

09:30.655 --> 09:32.198
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.036
- Say, you headed to LA?
- That's right.

09:36.161 --> 09:39.080
Could you give me a lift?

09:40.457 --> 09:42.417
I don't think so.

09:43.585 --> 09:45.754
- Could you help me?
- What do you want?

09:45.879 --> 09:48.757
Do you know
which freeway I would take...?

09:48.882 --> 09:51.384
- Where are you going?
- Looking for this place in LA.

09:51.509 --> 09:54.387
- In Hollywood, you know.
- Yeah, well, Hollywood's that way.

09:54.512 --> 09:57.599
I know what direction it's in.
That's not what I'm asking.

09:58.558 --> 10:00.018
What do you need?

10:00.143 --> 10:04.314
Looking for this place called the Betsy.
It's a real famous spot.

10:04.439 --> 10:07.484
Showing off our car there tonight.
Gonna blow their goddamn minds.

10:07.609 --> 10:11.362
Well, it's right there,
just off the freeway, straight up.

10:11.488 --> 10:14.115
- You been there?
- No, too rich for my blood.

10:15.325 --> 10:17.160
Thanks a lot.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.116
Say, can I help you?

10:57.826 --> 11:00.745
Just looking.
It's a hell of a car.

11:01.788 --> 11:03.414
I'm glad you like it.

11:14.801 --> 11:16.886
Tyke, check the back.

11:38.950 --> 11:40.285
Let's go.

12:05.685 --> 12:07.312
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:07.437 --> 12:09.731
- You headed for LA?
- I could be.

12:09.856 --> 12:11.608
Perhaps you could...

12:20.783 --> 12:23.661
- How you doing, Quint?
- Not bad. Little car trouble.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.414
- Yeah, I see.
- I don't have what you're looking for.

12:26.539 --> 12:28.791
Why do I think you do?

12:28.917 --> 12:31.878
You have bad information.
You always do.

12:32.003 --> 12:35.173
Mr Quint and I go back a ways.

12:35.298 --> 12:37.967
We used to be, what, in competition?

12:38.092 --> 12:40.094
I never considered you
competition, Marvin.

12:40.220 --> 12:43.014
Oh, that's not nice, Quint.
We had our moments.

12:43.139 --> 12:45.600
You must've had yours in private.

12:45.725 --> 12:48.061
Hang on. A couple of ways
we can do this now, boys.

13:42.115 --> 13:44.117
I'm getting too old for this.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.207
Put it away and get out.

13:58.923 --> 14:02.218
Things have changed. I need the money
and passport right away.

14:02.343 --> 14:03.845
Where's the cassette?

14:03.970 --> 14:05.972
On deposit.
I'll have it for you tonight.

14:08.308 --> 14:11.602
You wouldn't be thinking about going
back into business for yourself?

14:11.728 --> 14:13.479
Only if I have to.

14:14.605 --> 14:18.151
The Attorney General's in court
Friday morning, nine o'clock.

14:18.276 --> 14:22.530
Those tax records are Exhibit A.
He wants them there.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.659
- Remember Marvin Ringer?
- We almost hired him.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.328
They told us you were better.

14:28.453 --> 14:30.913
He was there last night
and I think he took it personally.

14:31.039 --> 14:33.082
- How did he spot you?
- That's not the point.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.751
You're losing your touch, Quint.

14:34.876 --> 14:37.712
The point is you were supposed
to check their personnel list.

14:37.837 --> 14:40.923
Marvin Ringer is a real problem for me.
We have mutual acquaintances.

14:41.049 --> 14:42.925
If you fucked up,
don't try to put it on us.

14:43.051 --> 14:45.511
- I got your cassette, OK?
- So what are we talking about?

14:45.636 --> 14:48.097
We're talking about money.
My price has doubled.

14:49.223 --> 14:52.977
- You are a thief.
- Call it hazard pay.

14:53.102 --> 14:56.898
I want the money, the ID
and the passport tonight at 8:30

14:57.023 --> 14:58.900
in a high-dollar joint called the Betsy.

15:04.072 --> 15:07.575
As you can see, Doctor,
it's quite a revolutionary design.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.911
Earl here used to be
number three man at NASA.

15:10.036 --> 15:13.247
- There were a couple of Krauts...
- All right, Billy, that's enough.

15:13.373 --> 15:15.750
Now, after the Mars project
was cancelled, Doctor,

15:15.875 --> 15:17.251
I started working on my own.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.629
I've always had an interest
in alternative fuels.

15:19.754 --> 15:23.383
- It involves a hydrogen compound?
- Oh, not a compound, Doctor.

15:23.508 --> 15:27.136
Hydrogen split off from water,
but ordinary tap water.

15:27.261 --> 15:31.140
- The converter's here in the engine.
- It's like science fiction, no?

15:31.265 --> 15:33.726
- A jet car?
- Uh...

15:33.851 --> 15:36.062
- Please.
- Even the body's unique.

15:36.187 --> 15:39.107
It's made of Kevlar, the material
they use for bulletproof vests.

15:39.232 --> 15:41.192
I want you to keep an eye
on this baby.

15:41.317 --> 15:43.486
And I mean both eyes. You got it?

15:43.611 --> 15:47.448
Anyone comes within breathing distance,
I want you to come and tell me about it.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.200
OK? Good man.

16:08.261 --> 16:11.556
- Beauty, isn't she?
- Oh, fabulous.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.850
- Is she yours?
- I drive her.

16:13.975 --> 16:15.560
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

16:15.685 --> 16:18.980
I'm a professional and I can tell you,
and I'm not just saying this,

16:19.105 --> 16:21.858
that this car is the single most
sensational thing on wheels

16:21.983 --> 16:23.734
since the turbo.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.737
Wow. Could I see her?

16:26.863 --> 16:28.281
Oh, yeah.

16:54.891 --> 16:56.225
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.602
Sorry.

17:21.209 --> 17:22.752
'3-7-9-0-2.'

17:22.877 --> 17:25.296
This is Nina.
I want an order to go.

17:26.464 --> 17:29.592
- 'You're only on stakeout.'
- No, it's too ripe.

17:31.219 --> 17:32.553
'Stand by.'

17:47.944 --> 17:51.155
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Hell of a car.

17:52.198 --> 17:55.701
Yes, sir, hell of a car.
Better keep an eye on it.

17:56.827 --> 17:59.205
'You have approval. 20 minutes.'

17:59.330 --> 18:00.623
Thank you.

18:05.670 --> 18:09.757
Now, let us be frank, Dr Melato,
I appreciate the interest

18:09.882 --> 18:12.677
that your company has shown
in the Black Moon,

18:12.802 --> 18:16.639
but being an American I'd like to give
an American manufacturer the chance.

18:16.764 --> 18:20.268
But you have not much encouragement
from your American companies.

18:20.393 --> 18:23.229
- I wouldn't say that...
- No, no, as you say, let us be frank.

18:24.814 --> 18:27.275
Your Black Moon is
a fascinating prototype.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.820
But it is still a prototype.
Much more testing is necessary.

18:30.945 --> 18:34.574
My engineers will be here on Friday,
in three days.

18:34.699 --> 18:39.537
They have seen a report
and here they will look and decide.

18:39.662 --> 18:42.331
If they say yes,
I will make my offer.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.376
A substantial offer.
The rest is up to you.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.336
- I understand.
<i>- Scusi.</i>

18:52.091 --> 18:55.177
I apologise.
It seems I must go.

18:55.303 --> 18:57.763
- You will arrange for Friday?
- Of course, Doctor.

18:57.888 --> 19:01.058
<i>Buono</i>. Please, enjoy.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.853
<i>Buona notte.</i>

19:09.567 --> 19:12.486
Allow me to propose a toast

19:12.612 --> 19:15.114
to the best designer and mechanic
in the whole damn world.

19:16.157 --> 19:18.451
So, what do you like? Tell me.

19:18.576 --> 19:19.994
Draught.

19:23.039 --> 19:25.958
- I think you like action.
- Really?

19:26.083 --> 19:29.170
- It's right there, in your eyes.
- Is it?

19:29.295 --> 19:31.422
I bet when you walked in here
you thought,

19:31.547 --> 19:34.550
"I wouldn't mind meeting
someone new and interesting tonight."

19:34.675 --> 19:37.762
I never mind meeting
someone new and... interesting.

19:39.013 --> 19:41.807
- Do you live around here?
- Why?

19:43.684 --> 19:47.396
What would you say if I told you
that I'd like to take you home

19:47.521 --> 19:49.774
and fuck your brains out?

19:51.776 --> 19:54.945
I'd say you're in
for a long and lonely night.

19:56.614 --> 19:58.824
Well, you can't blame me
for trying, huh?

19:58.949 --> 20:01.577
I never blame anyone for trying.

20:04.372 --> 20:07.249
They're all so neurotic,
they don't know what they want.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.293
Hello...

20:14.674 --> 20:16.258
I'll just be a minute.

20:20.721 --> 20:24.100
I think you like action.
It's right there, right in your eyes.

20:32.983 --> 20:37.655
Hello. I will take the keys
to the Rolls-Royce, the Excalibur...

20:37.780 --> 20:40.241
I bet when you walked
in here, you thought,

20:40.366 --> 20:43.452
"I wouldn't mind meeting
someone new and interesting tonight."

20:43.577 --> 20:47.456
...the Aston Martin
and the two Mercedes.

20:47.581 --> 20:50.126
What would you say
if I said I'd like to take you home?

21:09.103 --> 21:11.147
What is going on here?

21:11.772 --> 21:15.151
Oh, my God, they're stealing the cars.
They're stealing the cars!

21:28.914 --> 21:30.291
The phone is dead.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.845
Well, I guess that's it.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.598
Thank you for your help.
Put him somewhere.

21:52.688 --> 21:54.106
Turbo pressure...

21:56.150 --> 21:57.401
Ignition.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.559
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Would you move back for me there?

29:38.445 --> 29:42.366
Look, it's an experimental car, Officer.
It's called the Black Moon.

29:42.491 --> 29:45.702
- Yeah, we lose 3,000 cars a day.
- There's only one of these.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.705
That's 125 every hour.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.541
Officer, we've got everything we own
tied up in this car.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.461
- Now, give us a break. Come on!
- Look, I'm sorry, mister, but...

29:54.586 --> 29:56.463
we're doing everything we can.

30:03.262 --> 30:06.598
- You're a little late.
- I was here. But I left.

30:08.976 --> 30:11.061
- Where's the cassette?
- Somebody stole it.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.646
- Somebody stole it?
- Mmm-hmm.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.982
I'll get it back for you, though.
I need some help.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.276
- That's not the way it happens.
- It is now.

30:17.401 --> 30:21.530
You motherfucker.
Let me tell you something.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.365
You got no help, no nothing.

30:23.490 --> 30:27.744
What you got is exactly 72 hours
to lay that cassette in my hand.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.788
If you don't,

30:29.913 --> 30:33.208
I'm gonna take all the heat
that comes down on my head

30:33.333 --> 30:35.168
and I'm gonna transfer it
to your body.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.129
You understand what I'm saying?

30:38.297 --> 30:40.841
Three days. Friday morning.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.385
Be in touch.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.347
Hey. What about my money?

30:54.062 --> 30:56.440
Don't fuck with the government.

31:07.951 --> 31:10.454
How would you gentlemen like
to get your car back?

31:10.579 --> 31:13.123
Now, if what you say is true,
we have to contact the police.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.667
- What are they gonna do?
- Look, I don't have any idea

31:15.792 --> 31:17.210
what your problems may be...

31:17.336 --> 31:20.339
There's nothing they can do.
There's no proof, just my word.

31:22.966 --> 31:27.220
Look at those towers.
This is a huge operation, gentlemen.

31:27.346 --> 31:31.058
They must've got ten cars last night
and that's probably just an average haul.

31:31.183 --> 31:34.603
And from the looks of that garage,
this whole place is a fortress.

31:36.730 --> 31:39.983
- Which you can crack.
- Hell, yes.

31:43.904 --> 31:45.364
Good luck.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.704
You'll never see that car again, boys.

32:01.129 --> 32:05.384
What are we gonna tell the police?
We didn't see anything. He did.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.762
Earl, what if he's right?

32:59.312 --> 33:00.647
Knock, knock.

33:29.718 --> 33:31.803
Ryland wants you.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.430
The cars OK?

33:33.555 --> 33:36.224
Yeah. I had to tear out one ignition.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.604
- Is he upstairs?
- Yeah.

33:45.775 --> 33:48.612
- Ryland's looking for you.
- I know, I know.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.713
Put it with the others.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.678
This will be my showcase.

34:54.803 --> 34:57.681
Lounge over there,
offices, communication centre.

34:57.806 --> 34:59.849
Complete business facilities.

34:59.975 --> 35:03.645
When the second tower is open,
the whole complex will be unique.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.230
Nothing like it anywhere.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.941
- Most impressive.
- Thank you.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.484
So, what's the problem?

35:09.609 --> 35:12.862
The problem is, you're not delivering
what you promised to me.

35:12.988 --> 35:15.407
My clients are... most particular.

35:15.532 --> 35:18.076
- They're used to the best.
- That's what they're getting.

35:18.201 --> 35:21.997
Ah. Most of the cars are damaged.
My inspectors have uncovered many flaws.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.332
My people inspect them too.

35:24.457 --> 35:27.836
- I'm telling you what is the case.
- Are you?

35:27.961 --> 35:30.130
Are you saying I would lie to you?

35:31.256 --> 35:36.052
- I was talking with Molina.
- No, no, no. Molina? No.

35:38.054 --> 35:40.765
Molina is a big <i>chico!</i>

35:43.226 --> 35:45.020
The man doesn't have
a shred of honour!

35:47.063 --> 35:49.482
<i>Ese hombre,</i> huh,
what does he know?

35:50.442 --> 35:53.445
He thinks you might have
difficulties in other areas.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.071
My business is of no concern to you.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.657
We have agreements
I expect you to live up to.

35:57.782 --> 36:01.453
Don't come here with spurious excuses
about damaged cars.

36:05.081 --> 36:06.666
You and Molina?

36:10.754 --> 36:13.048
You deserve each other.

36:13.173 --> 36:15.550
You owe me $420,000.

36:16.384 --> 36:21.014
You give me cars I cannot sell,
I have no responsibility.

36:21.765 --> 36:24.309
I'm going to collect it.

36:25.602 --> 36:27.646
One way or another.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.154
Is this a threat to me?

36:37.489 --> 36:41.242
Don't threaten me.
I don't fear you.

36:41.368 --> 36:45.705
You have many big dreams,
but at heart you're a little man.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.416
<i>Así...</i>

36:49.793 --> 36:51.378
<i>Chiquitito.</i>

37:04.182 --> 37:05.975
He's crazy. <i>Loco!</i>

37:06.101 --> 37:09.145
Why do you work
for such a man, huh?

37:09.270 --> 37:12.273
<i>Es un animal!</i>

37:16.611 --> 37:19.072
- Mr Molina called.
- Not now.

37:41.553 --> 37:43.763
What is it?

37:49.018 --> 37:50.812
He's watching.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.518
- Yes, yes.
- That's for the electric.

38:30.643 --> 38:33.188
- And this is for the pipes.
- OK.

38:33.313 --> 38:36.149
- And I want you to sign for the forms.
- Hey, Quint.

38:36.274 --> 38:38.276
- Iron John.
- We're a little busy right now.

38:38.401 --> 38:40.612
Will you get the hell out of here?

38:53.374 --> 38:56.836
This is the only way
they'll let me get the job finished.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.674
- How long have you been back?
- Not long.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.094
- I don't freelance any more.
- Oh, I know. I heard about it.

39:06.471 --> 39:10.308
- You joined the Feds.
- They offer a real good pension plan.

39:16.147 --> 39:17.857
That's, uh, Ryland Towers.

39:19.234 --> 39:23.154
- I built part of the first one.
- I got this from the Hall of Records.

39:23.279 --> 39:26.366
Apparently, the complex was built
over a branch of the sewer system

39:26.491 --> 39:28.409
that was sealed off as unsafe.

39:28.535 --> 39:30.370
They got permits for everything.

39:31.704 --> 39:33.623
That Ed Ryland,
he's got connections.

39:33.748 --> 39:37.043
He used a lot more foundation material
than he needed.

39:37.168 --> 39:41.756
He got too much
electrical equipment by 50%,

39:41.881 --> 39:44.592
and his first submitted plan
calls for three elevators

39:44.717 --> 39:46.469
plus an express up to the penthouse.

39:47.345 --> 39:50.932
Over here he's got a freight elevator
with extended capacity.

39:51.057 --> 39:54.185
Like I said,
I built part of the first one.

39:56.312 --> 39:59.691
- What are you looking for?
- The real blueprints and floorplans.

40:00.358 --> 40:03.736
Especially for the lower levels
and the parking garage.

40:03.862 --> 40:07.115
Plus anything on the alarms.
I had a few problems last time out.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.242
Yeah, they got something new
every week.

40:10.535 --> 40:14.455
French, Emile French.
He was the consultant on security.

40:16.666 --> 40:17.834
Emile French.

40:17.959 --> 40:19.669
Sounds like you're going in.

40:21.004 --> 40:24.465
- I got three days.
- You got all the time in the world.

40:46.571 --> 40:48.531
I've never seen anything like it.

40:50.283 --> 40:54.454
This is the catalytic converter.
Breaks down the water.

40:54.579 --> 40:57.624
- Runs on hydrogen?
- Runs on something.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.377
It's so light.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.756
Yeah, must be a composite
of some kind.

41:09.802 --> 41:12.013
Interesting machine. What is it?

41:12.138 --> 41:13.973
It's an interesting machine.

41:16.684 --> 41:20.271
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- Nothing. It's mine.

41:21.439 --> 41:22.899
I see.

41:23.024 --> 41:26.486
- You're making these decisions now?
- Just this once.

41:26.611 --> 41:29.530
Good. For a moment
I thought you were after my job.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.620
I understand
there was a problem last night.

41:35.745 --> 41:37.372
What do you mean?

41:38.498 --> 41:40.917
A guy tried to follow me.
I lost him.

41:41.042 --> 41:42.543
- Did you?
- Yes.

41:43.503 --> 41:46.631
There was a man in the outer garage
right after you got in.

41:46.756 --> 41:48.549
Coincidence?

41:50.051 --> 41:51.177
I lost him.

41:52.637 --> 41:54.514
So it was a coincidence.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.184
A car like this
attracts a lot of attention.

41:59.727 --> 42:03.523
- Did you think about that?
- I brought in half your goddamn order.

42:03.648 --> 42:06.526
This is a business, Nina.
We don't take trophies.

42:06.651 --> 42:09.988
Fine.
Do whatever you want with it.

42:14.826 --> 42:16.536
I have your permission, do I?

42:30.883 --> 42:32.301
Quite a car.

43:22.894 --> 43:24.937
Why is that car in there?

43:29.067 --> 43:31.319
I asked you a question.

43:31.444 --> 43:33.529
Ask Mr Ryland.

43:54.008 --> 43:57.595
- Open the door, Richard!
- 'One moment.'

44:03.434 --> 44:06.270
- What?
- 'Nina wants to leave.'

44:10.817 --> 44:14.529
- Where are you going?
- 'Jesus Christ. Out!'

44:14.654 --> 44:17.323
- I want to see you.
- 'Later.'

44:17.448 --> 44:18.908
Now.

44:19.033 --> 44:20.618
'No.'

44:22.286 --> 44:23.996
Nina! Nina!

44:24.122 --> 44:25.123
'Nina!'

44:26.999 --> 44:29.460
Nina! Where the hell are you going?

44:30.837 --> 44:33.506
'Nina, are you out of your mind?

44:34.590 --> 44:37.135
'I'm not going to open the door.

44:46.394 --> 44:48.604
'Nina, stop! Stop right now!

44:48.729 --> 44:51.232
'I won't give in to this.
I won't open it.'

44:51.357 --> 44:52.357
Nina!

48:04.383 --> 48:05.468
Hi.

48:42.922 --> 48:44.757
- Where are you going?
- Downtown.

48:46.342 --> 48:47.885
Fine.

49:05.236 --> 49:06.445
Nice car.

49:07.405 --> 49:08.864
Thank you.

49:08.989 --> 49:11.325
My dad had a Studebaker.
He loved it.

49:11.450 --> 49:13.077
How about that?

49:14.036 --> 49:16.038
You like cars, don't you?

49:16.163 --> 49:17.540
Nice ones.

49:18.290 --> 49:22.711
Some friends of mine had a nice car.
Really very special. It got stolen.

49:22.837 --> 49:25.005
Ah, that's too bad.

49:28.300 --> 49:29.635
They're hoping to get it back.

49:31.554 --> 49:34.140
What will they do, your friends?

49:34.265 --> 49:37.476
I don't know. They're trying to decide.
There's not much time.

49:37.601 --> 49:39.270
I know how that is.

49:40.938 --> 49:42.398
Any ideas?

49:42.523 --> 49:44.567
Me? Why?

49:45.776 --> 49:47.445
Just making conversation.

49:52.366 --> 49:53.951
Must be a way.

49:55.995 --> 49:57.997
Must be a couple of ways.

50:03.419 --> 50:05.421
'What do you want me to say?'

50:05.546 --> 50:09.258
'Whatever you like.
Tell me about yourself.'

50:11.552 --> 50:14.221
- 'What's this for?'
- 'For me.

50:15.139 --> 50:19.143
- 'Where's your family?'
- 'I don't know. Where's yours?'

50:19.268 --> 50:21.395
'You're not in contact
with them?'

50:22.688 --> 50:24.356
'Yeah, right.'

50:25.524 --> 50:29.195
- 'So you're alone here?'
- 'When I wanna be.'

50:30.446 --> 50:34.074
'Try to relax. We're just talking.'

50:35.701 --> 50:36.785
'I know.'

50:38.120 --> 50:40.206
'Where did you learn
to handle a car?'

50:41.582 --> 50:45.753
'Boyfriend. Other than that,
he was a jerk.'

50:47.171 --> 50:51.091
- 'You're very good.'
- 'Yeah, I got a great future.'

50:52.551 --> 50:54.803
'You say that
like you don't believe it.'

50:56.347 --> 50:57.848
'Yeah, I do.

50:59.808 --> 51:02.394
'I'm special. Didn't you notice?'

51:02.520 --> 51:04.522
'As a matter of fact, I did.'

51:06.398 --> 51:08.025
'Everyone does.'

53:03.265 --> 53:05.351
Just how many names have you got?

53:07.144 --> 53:08.896
How many wigs have you got?

53:11.649 --> 53:14.693
- Tea?
- Yeah.

53:34.546 --> 53:37.007
What exactly do you expect me
to do for you?

53:38.175 --> 53:40.010
Nothing, not a thing.

53:44.390 --> 53:47.976
Don't lie. Please.

54:07.788 --> 54:10.582
Why don't you tell me
about your friends?

54:11.834 --> 54:14.503
I don't really have any friends.

54:14.628 --> 54:15.838
Do you?

54:18.382 --> 54:20.467
What about those people
you work for?

54:21.719 --> 54:23.011
Who do you mean?

54:23.137 --> 54:24.847
Come on.
We ought to trust each other.

54:24.972 --> 54:27.141
We have a lot in common,
you know.

54:27.266 --> 54:29.852
- What?
- We're both thieves.

54:31.729 --> 54:34.523
- And what do you steal?
- This and that.

54:34.648 --> 54:38.652
Actually, as soon as my current
obligations are taken care of, I'm...

54:38.777 --> 54:40.404
retiring.

54:42.072 --> 54:44.324
And what do retired thieves do?

54:45.325 --> 54:46.994
They get away.

54:50.247 --> 54:52.875
- Where to?
- I don't know.

54:54.209 --> 54:55.836
How about Rio?

54:58.964 --> 55:01.091
Why have you been following me?

55:03.343 --> 55:05.053
I need that funny-looking car.

55:05.804 --> 55:08.140
What makes you think
I'd help you?

55:08.807 --> 55:10.642
You have an honest face.

55:14.062 --> 55:15.272
Forget it.

55:18.692 --> 55:20.611
I won't let you use me.

55:25.073 --> 55:27.743
First the guy last night, now this.

55:29.036 --> 55:30.788
Deal with them.

55:33.165 --> 55:35.584
What are we doing here?
Why don't we talk to that fella?

55:35.709 --> 55:37.419
He was right about the cops,
wasn't he?

55:38.170 --> 55:40.798
'Security cameras are
focusing on the centre aisle.

55:40.923 --> 55:42.758
- 'Stay to the side.'
- 'Earl...'

55:42.883 --> 55:45.511
'Stop your damn whining.
The police want evidence.'

55:49.807 --> 55:52.351
I thought I told you
to use the telephoto lens?

55:52.476 --> 55:55.562
The details have got to be razor-sharp,
down to the licence numbers.

55:55.687 --> 55:56.855
Now, Tyke...

55:58.148 --> 55:59.691
Huh? It's no good.

55:59.817 --> 56:01.193
In the car.

56:04.154 --> 56:05.155
Go.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.866
Now, you stay here and wait for Tyke.
I'm going down.

57:19.855 --> 57:21.815
Earl!

57:22.774 --> 57:24.651
Earl!

57:26.695 --> 57:28.322
Earl!

58:38.767 --> 58:40.268
We changed our minds.

58:48.068 --> 58:50.362
Some of this is reliable
and some isn't.

58:51.196 --> 58:54.282
We'll get the accurate floor plans
from Iron John tonight.

58:54.408 --> 58:57.577
- He told us you worked on the alarms.
- I consulted.

58:57.703 --> 59:02.290
A German outfit put it in.
Plus, uh... What's his name? Ryland.

59:02.416 --> 59:05.043
He, uh... He threw in
a few wrinkles of his own.

59:06.086 --> 59:09.589
- It's tight.
- That's why we're here.

59:17.764 --> 59:20.726
You know that one of the towers
isn't open yet?

59:20.851 --> 59:23.937
We've been looking at that.
We thought we might be able to use it.

59:24.062 --> 59:26.773
They don't connect.
There's no direct link.

59:26.898 --> 59:28.734
We'll make a direct link.

59:30.277 --> 59:34.031
I know you're a hotshot and all that,
Quint, but this place...

59:34.156 --> 59:35.532
I don't know.

59:40.746 --> 59:43.707
Just... what is it
you want to take out of here?

59:43.832 --> 59:45.876
A car.

59:50.839 --> 59:52.257
A car...

01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:25.457
John?

01:00:40.055 --> 01:00:41.473
John?

01:00:51.149 --> 01:00:52.818
These what you're looking for?

01:00:57.197 --> 01:00:59.074
It's time to make a deal, Quint.

01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:01.118
You been dealing with John, Marvin?

01:01:01.243 --> 01:01:03.912
He didn't want to.
He was smarter than that.

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:08.834
I want that cassette.
You know you're gonna give it to me.

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:13.839
Eventually.

01:01:14.506 --> 01:01:15.507
Stop it!

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:20.137
So why make it painful?

01:01:30.063 --> 01:01:31.481
Get him out of here.

01:01:48.665 --> 01:01:50.292
Come on.

01:01:55.422 --> 01:01:57.132
Again?

01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:05.807
Yeah!

01:02:08.685 --> 01:02:11.438
Hey, Quint, hold out a while.
This is fun.

01:02:12.564 --> 01:02:14.357
Kick his butt!

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:27.829
Get up! Aargh!

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:33.585
Not a big man anymore, huh?

01:02:57.943 --> 01:03:02.155
Quint, that's pathetic.
You got a reputation to uphold.

01:03:03.657 --> 01:03:05.992
How about another one, big guy?

01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:10.205
Where's he going?

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:12.958
- Don't know.
- Huh?

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:15.502
- Get him out.
- Come on, out!

01:03:15.627 --> 01:03:17.087
Drag him out of there.

01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:19.130
Come on!

01:03:19.256 --> 01:03:22.968
I told these boys all about you.
You're letting me down.

01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:24.594
Come on, man!

01:05:33.598 --> 01:05:35.558
I was driving by
and I saw your lights.

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:38.269
I thought I'd say hello.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.566
Aargh!

01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:46.027
I'm sorry.
It's gonna hurt a little bit.

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:47.654
It already hurts.

01:05:53.493 --> 01:05:56.246
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

01:05:56.371 --> 01:05:57.956
A little.

01:06:12.262 --> 01:06:13.596
Oh, thank you.

01:06:15.432 --> 01:06:17.976
I haven't asked what happened,
because I don't wanna know.

01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:20.770
I have problems of my own.

01:06:20.895 --> 01:06:22.772
Ah. With your boss, Ryland?

01:06:24.774 --> 01:06:26.443
The name keeps coming up.

01:06:35.618 --> 01:06:37.787
Just how badly
do you want that car?

01:06:38.663 --> 01:06:40.373
Look at me.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.082
OK, you've blown the lock.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.710
What are you gonna do
with those wires?

01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:28.922
They're all a trap.
Any one of them will trip the alarm.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:30.507
So now what?

01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:36.554
Come on, Earl. You worked
for NASA, for Christ's sake.

01:07:46.773 --> 01:07:48.983
OK, so now the alarm is off.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:50.652
Nice going.

01:07:52.862 --> 01:07:55.532
Jesus! What the hell
happened to you?

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.958
Gentlemen,
timing is of the essence.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:09.003
This is one of the most secure buildings
I've ever seen. There's no way in.

01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.797
The weakness is this building,

01:08:10.922 --> 01:08:13.049
the unfinished building
with no security system

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:14.467
other than Deputy Dawg.

01:08:15.468 --> 01:08:17.929
If I can get up to the top
of this building here,

01:08:18.054 --> 01:08:22.058
I can get to the top of that one there
and you can come in from the bottom.

01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:24.935
We'll go down the access tunnels
under the garage

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.522
and we'll cut into the video cable here,

01:08:27.647 --> 01:08:31.024
make a loop of the empty garage,
bypassing the camera here,

01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:34.069
and then feed it back
into the monitoring system.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.698
That will give us a clear shot
at the false wall here.

01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:39.408
If our timing is right,
it should work.

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.911
It should work.

01:08:58.886 --> 01:09:01.014
I want to show you something.

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:15.319
This man got into the outer garage
the night you brought the car in.

01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:18.990
The night you were followed.

01:09:19.115 --> 01:09:21.826
- You know this man?
- Not really.

01:09:25.496 --> 01:09:27.790
What do you think he was looking for?

01:09:27.915 --> 01:09:31.085
- You're asking me?
- Do you have any ideas?

01:09:32.337 --> 01:09:33.462
No.

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:40.053
This next tape was just brought in
from a remote surveillance unit.

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:47.977
You bastard!

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:52.899
- You betrayed me.
- I only wish I had.

01:09:53.024 --> 01:09:55.401
Real Nina.
Let's see the real Nina.

01:09:58.112 --> 01:10:00.239
Stop it. Stop it!

01:10:00.365 --> 01:10:02.325
Don't turn away.
Let's watch this together.

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.869
Let's see how you repaid me
for everything I did for you.

01:10:04.994 --> 01:10:07.664
- I owe you nothing.
- I gave you a life.

01:10:07.789 --> 01:10:09.207
You gave me your life.

01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:11.501
- And you grabbed at it.
- I was on the street.

01:10:11.626 --> 01:10:14.379
- I would've grabbed at anything.
- Know how I found her, Luis?

01:10:14.504 --> 01:10:18.758
She was sleeping in a burned-out hotel
and she tried to steal my car.

01:10:18.883 --> 01:10:20.718
My car!

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:24.180
And she almost got away with it.
She was a natural.

01:10:24.305 --> 01:10:26.391
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

01:10:26.516 --> 01:10:28.935
I remember when I was desperate.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.728
Get her out of here.

01:10:35.483 --> 01:10:37.819
Get the truth out of her.

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:56.170
You try it.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:11:00.967
- What's that for?
- Vaccinations.

01:11:14.439 --> 01:11:16.023
Hope to hell this thing works.

01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:18.860
That laser beam will blind
all their TV cameras.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:23.197
It's crazy you going in alone
in your condition.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:24.907
One of us should be going in with you.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:26.951
I'll need both of you
to get me out of there.

01:11:28.286 --> 01:11:30.121
- With the car.
- I'm the driver here.

01:11:30.246 --> 01:11:32.081
I should be handling the Black Moon.

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:34.250
See if you can handle that.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:40.173
Earl, I don't know
if I could kill a man over a car.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:43.843
They did. Remember that.

01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:45.595
Time to sync up.

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:49.807
Gentlemen...

01:11:51.392 --> 01:11:56.105
we go precisely 15 minutes from...

01:11:58.316 --> 01:12:00.318
...now.

01:12:10.745 --> 01:12:11.996
Ready?

01:12:17.627 --> 01:12:18.753
Go.

01:13:06.759 --> 01:13:10.137
Report to security centre at once.
Maintenance, report to security.

01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:12.139
What is it?

01:13:12.265 --> 01:13:14.725
- The perimeter cameras...
- What's wrong with them?

01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:17.770
- Well, they were...
- Run a systems check.

01:13:21.107 --> 01:13:23.484
Think they got rats down here, Earl?

01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:32.952
There. There it is!
It's happened again.

01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:08.321
Hey! Hey, hey!
Where are you going?

01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:10.156
Hey, stop!

01:15:36.826 --> 01:15:39.787
- What do we do now?
- You'll see.

01:17:01.869 --> 01:17:03.662
Oh! Damn.

01:18:48.017 --> 01:18:49.476
This is the one.

01:20:24.822 --> 01:20:26.407
All right, do it.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.418
- Got it.
- Record it.

01:20:44.717 --> 01:20:46.552
That's enough for a loop.
Now replay.

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:56.145
Good. Let's go.

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:05.112
Any trouble with the monitors?

01:21:05.237 --> 01:21:06.613
No.

01:21:06.739 --> 01:21:08.615
- What's up?
- You tell me.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:21.337
Guard!

01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:27.593
Open this door!

01:21:37.853 --> 01:21:40.689
- Open this door!
- Hey.

01:21:41.982 --> 01:21:44.485
What are you doing?

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.403
Get me out of here.

01:21:46.528 --> 01:21:47.988
Stand back.

01:21:50.324 --> 01:21:51.325
Come on.

01:21:52.242 --> 01:21:53.285
Argh!

01:22:00.459 --> 01:22:02.878
Let me tape that grate back.

01:22:44.628 --> 01:22:47.047
- How you doing?
- I'm OK.

01:22:57.850 --> 01:22:59.685
No, don't do that.

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.522
- Look at that.
- Must be a short circuit.

01:23:59.745 --> 01:24:01.705
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:09.421
Well?

01:24:35.489 --> 01:24:36.823
OK.

01:24:43.247 --> 01:24:44.915
Nina?

01:25:20.951 --> 01:25:22.744
Come on.
What's the problem?

01:25:22.869 --> 01:25:26.373
Been a while since I worked
on one of these. It's obsolete.

01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:29.710
Let me try.

01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:38.093
We've still got problems, Mr Ryland.

01:25:39.261 --> 01:25:41.638
There she is.
Who's that with her?

01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:45.100
- Something's going on in the garage.
- Sound the alert.

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:46.810
Oh, no.

01:25:46.935 --> 01:25:48.604
They've seen us.

01:25:48.729 --> 01:25:50.522
That's it.

01:25:50.647 --> 01:25:52.983
- What's that?
- Let's go.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.527
I got it.

01:26:14.713 --> 01:26:17.257
Careful with those brakes.

01:26:17.382 --> 01:26:19.009
I drove it, remember?

01:26:35.776 --> 01:26:37.778
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

01:26:42.532 --> 01:26:43.992
Hurry!

01:26:59.966 --> 01:27:01.510
Armed.

01:27:01.635 --> 01:27:04.179
- Keep them away from the door.
- What about the door?

01:27:08.016 --> 01:27:11.311
I hope you know what you're doing,
because I've been here before.

01:27:26.535 --> 01:27:29.705
- You tried to blow it?
- That thing's not in the blueprints.

01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:30.830
They're trapped.

01:27:59.025 --> 01:28:02.529
Any ideas?
I am wide open to suggestions.

01:28:05.866 --> 01:28:06.992
Oh, shit.

01:28:13.498 --> 01:28:15.041
Push them back. Push them in.

01:28:16.543 --> 01:28:17.711
No, not this way.

01:28:17.836 --> 01:28:19.546
- What?
- Freight elevator.

01:28:21.298 --> 01:28:22.298
Close it.

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:26.428
Now take them to the unfinished floor.

01:28:35.854 --> 01:28:38.064
- How do we stop this thing?
- We can't!

01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:17.979
Hold it, stop.

01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:26.238
Very impressive, but now what?

01:29:27.864 --> 01:29:30.075
We just stand here
and stare at each other?

01:29:32.536 --> 01:29:36.039
It's over. The game is over.

01:29:37.207 --> 01:29:39.459
You've done well.

01:29:39.584 --> 01:29:43.547
Gave my security system quite a workout,
pointed out some problems.

01:29:44.297 --> 01:29:45.715
You, sir, behind the wheel,

01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:49.553
we've never met,
but I've admired your performances.

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.013
You'll be remembered.

01:29:52.138 --> 01:29:53.783
Wish there were a couple of ways
to do this.

01:29:53.807 --> 01:29:55.308
There's only one way.

01:29:57.435 --> 01:30:01.857
You, Nina, step out of the car
and walk away from it.

01:30:03.525 --> 01:30:05.861
We'll call this episode a, er...

01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:08.780
an unfortunate breakdown
in communications.

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:10.782
For both of us.

01:30:15.036 --> 01:30:16.246
Give me your gun.

01:30:36.016 --> 01:30:37.309
Get down!

01:30:45.066 --> 01:30:46.067
Punch it.

01:31:45.794 --> 01:31:47.212
Congratulations, Quint.

01:31:47.337 --> 01:31:50.632
You just gave a whole new meaning
to the term "breaking and entering".

01:31:51.633 --> 01:31:53.051
I'll be taking that.

01:31:55.428 --> 01:31:57.055
Get him.

01:31:58.682 --> 01:32:01.768
Now, let's see...
where was it we left off?

01:32:20.578 --> 01:32:23.164
- Aargh!
- Goddamn... bastard!

01:32:24.416 --> 01:32:25.709
Shut up, bitch!

01:32:34.759 --> 01:32:36.553
Give me your gun.
I need your gun!

01:32:36.678 --> 01:32:38.054
Give him some room.

01:33:51.377 --> 01:33:54.130
You're just not a winner, Marvin.

01:33:57.467 --> 01:33:59.427
You're not even a runner-up.

01:34:04.724 --> 01:34:07.310
Better watch that guy.
He's a criminal.

01:34:11.147 --> 01:34:12.649
Nice job, Quint.

01:34:12.774 --> 01:34:15.110
- Thanks.
- Hour and a half to spare.

01:34:18.488 --> 01:34:21.449
- Next time.
- There won't be a next time!

01:34:21.574 --> 01:34:25.078
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:34:25.203 --> 01:34:26.621
Honest.

01:34:29.415 --> 01:34:30.667
Hmm.

01:34:37.382 --> 01:34:40.385
Oh, no. What do I tell the Italians?

01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:43.555
Forget the Italians, Earl.
Let's call Boeing.

01:35:12.167 --> 01:35:14.127
How are we gonna do this?

01:35:14.252 --> 01:35:16.171
Are you sure you're up to it?

01:35:20.717 --> 01:35:22.886
They beat me up, they didn't kill me.

01:35:30.643 --> 01:35:34.147
I think... it might be a good idea

01:35:34.272 --> 01:35:37.692
if you just lie still and give your body
a chance to rest.

01:35:43.323 --> 01:35:44.949
Tell me something...

01:35:47.911 --> 01:35:49.913
Are you glad you ripped that car off?

01:35:51.456 --> 01:35:52.874
Yeah.

01:36:01.216 --> 01:36:02.926
Me too.
