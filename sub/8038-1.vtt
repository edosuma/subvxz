00:04.314 --> 00:05.372
Camp
Rock.

00:05.482 --> 00:07.711
Connie: Mitchie! Up!
Last day of school!

00:07.817 --> 00:08.374
Mitchie's
tunes

00:10.619 --> 00:13.109
(Who will I be playing)

00:16.024 --> 00:18.116
Mitchie: (Singing) Whoa.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22.962 --> 00:27.625
How to choose who to be
well, let's see.

00:27.732 --> 00:30.758
There's so many choices now.

00:30.869 --> 00:33.860
Play guitar, be a movie star.

00:33.971 --> 00:39.067
In my head a voice says
why not try everything?

00:39.175 --> 00:42.234
Why stop? Reach for any dream

00:42.344 --> 00:44.403
I can rock.

00:44.513 --> 00:49.142
'Cause it's my life
and now's the time, who will I be?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.115
It's up to me.

00:51.219 --> 00:55.484
All the never-ending possibilities.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.250
That I can see.

00:57.357 --> 01:01.759
There's nothing that I can't do
who will I be?

01:01.861 --> 01:07.492
Yes, I believe I get to make the future
what I want to.

01:07.599 --> 01:12.831
If I can become anyone
and know the choice is up to me.

01:12.936 --> 01:14.368
Who will I be?

01:14.470 --> 01:19.099
I wanna find the who I am inside
who will I be?

01:19.207 --> 01:20.196
Mitchie's songs

01:20.775 --> 01:27.338
I wanna show the
the way that I can shine.

01:31.885 --> 01:33.853
Who will I be?

01:35.254 --> 01:36.721
(Rock music playing on tv)

01:36.822 --> 01:39.688
Oh, cool. Hot tunes is on.
Turn it up, please.

01:40.825 --> 01:43.259
The pop star phenom Shane gray
may have gone too far this time.

01:43.361 --> 01:44.419
Shane gray
scandal

01:44.528 --> 01:47.793
when he stormed off the set
of the new connect 3 video.

01:47.898 --> 01:51.924
Word is the other members
of connect 3 are fed up.

01:52.034 --> 01:55.002
This final stunt cost his label
thousands of dollars,

01:55.103 --> 01:57.901
but may cost them
the rest of their record deal.

01:58.306 --> 02:00.899
What is wrong with that boy?
He's got everything.

02:01.008 --> 02:02.441
Except a clue.

02:02.543 --> 02:05.568
The message is clear,
he needs to clean up his act.

02:05.678 --> 02:07.009
And to give him time to do it,

02:07.113 --> 02:10.048
the connect 3's summer tour
has been canceled.

02:13.285 --> 02:17.448
Look what I found in the crisper.
A camp rock brochure.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.580
Or should I say another
camp rock brochure?

02:19.690 --> 02:22.123
Hmm. Look at that.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.352
Oh, and great cheese omelet,
by the way.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.292
You should definitely add that
to your catering menu.

02:27.396 --> 02:29.830
So you have no idea
how this brochure got in there?

02:29.932 --> 02:32.559
Or the one taped
to the vacuum cleaner?

02:34.035 --> 02:37.162
Sweetie, I know you wanna go
to this camp.

02:37.270 --> 02:40.262
And I'm sorry,
but we just can't swing it right now.

02:40.373 --> 02:41.737
With dad expanding the store

02:41.840 --> 02:45.401
and my catering business
just taking off...

02:45.511 --> 02:47.637
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

02:47.745 --> 02:48.905
I know.

02:49.681 --> 02:51.876
Got to go.

02:51.982 --> 02:53.745
Last day of school.

02:53.850 --> 02:55.715
Don't want to be late.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.315
(School bell ringing

03:10.497 --> 03:12.930
- Hey, mitchie.
- Hey, Sierra.

03:13.032 --> 03:15.227
Let me be the first to say
shing sha ji, mitchie.

03:15.335 --> 03:16.734
It means, "happy summer, mitchie."

03:16.836 --> 03:20.737
Guess who got an a-plus
in ap mandarin? Me. Again.

03:20.839 --> 03:22.431
So, how'd it go this morning?

03:22.574 --> 03:25.235
It didn't. Camp rock is a no-go.

03:25.343 --> 03:28.470
But you have to go.
Camp rock is, like, the music camp.

03:28.578 --> 03:31.240
Anybody who wants to be somebody
in music...

03:31.348 --> 03:35.408
All of which you already know. Sorry.

03:35.517 --> 03:36.711
Me, too.

03:36.819 --> 03:40.754
I was just so excited to have a summer
that was all about music. And...

03:40.855 --> 03:42.516
I know.

03:42.624 --> 03:45.353
So, what are you going to do
this summer?

03:48.128 --> 03:49.617
(School bell ringing)

03:53.132 --> 03:55.122
So, how was work?

03:55.567 --> 03:59.162
You know Barney's. We serve burgers
with a Barney's smile.

04:01.105 --> 04:03.699
- So what's for dinner?
- Burgers.

04:03.807 --> 04:06.366
Well, our world-famous Torres burger.

04:06.876 --> 04:07.865
Um...

04:07.977 --> 04:09.137
I'll pass.

04:09.245 --> 04:12.042
Okay. I can't stand it. Tell her.

04:12.147 --> 04:15.547
- Well, Steve, she just got home.
- Tell me what?

04:15.650 --> 04:17.709
- Okay, honey. Drum roll.
- Mom?

04:17.817 --> 04:20.877
Okay. You're going to camp rock!

04:20.987 --> 04:23.820
- What?
- She said you're going to camp rock.

04:23.923 --> 04:27.517
Well, actually, we're going.
Connie's catering is going camping.

04:27.626 --> 04:29.685
Business is slow in the summer,
this is a steady job,

04:29.795 --> 04:33.457
and you get to go to camp
at a discounted rate!

04:33.564 --> 04:34.929
But you have to help out in the kitchen.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.432
Thank you!
Thank you, like, a million times!

04:37.534 --> 04:38.501
Oh.

04:40.370 --> 04:41.597
Camp

05:27.841 --> 05:29.365
Connie's catering

05:31.344 --> 05:34.437
- we're here.
- Yeah. Are you excited?

05:34.547 --> 05:38.448
A little. Okay, a lot! Yes! Major!

05:38.583 --> 05:42.349
Thank you, mom.
I'm gonna have so much fun.

05:42.454 --> 05:43.511
Whoa.

05:55.263 --> 05:56.321
Whoa.

05:57.699 --> 06:00.258
Okay. Sweetie, let's get settled in.

06:03.104 --> 06:04.331
Settled.

06:05.171 --> 06:08.504
That's great. Brown cesario.

06:08.608 --> 06:12.373
Camp director, founding member
and bass guitar of the white crows.

06:12.478 --> 06:15.935
And you must be Connie Torres,
our new cook.

06:16.047 --> 06:17.344
That's me.

06:17.448 --> 06:20.143
And this is my daughter.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.445
- Who's already gone.
- No worries.

06:22.552 --> 06:24.747
She probably just wanted
to get out there, get to it,

06:24.854 --> 06:25.946
you know what I mean?

06:26.055 --> 06:28.922
When the music calls,
you got to answer.

06:29.024 --> 06:32.823
I can't wait for you to meet her though.
She has got a great voice.

06:32.927 --> 06:35.827
- Look at me, I'm already bragging.
- Oh, you got to brag, love.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.524
Learned that from the mickster. Jagger.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.690
You knew Mick Jagger?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.291
Yeah. Backed him up for years.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.630
Great times, great times.

06:45.737 --> 06:47.500
But not as great as the time

06:47.606 --> 06:50.200
- when I toured with aerosmith.
- You knew aerosmith?

06:50.609 --> 06:52.473
(Playing upbeat tune)

07:05.721 --> 07:08.018
Sorry. I didn't... I didn't see you.

07:08.122 --> 07:09.419
Obviously.

07:12.893 --> 07:16.522
That's Tess Tyler,
the diva of camp rock.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.028
Mitchie: Is she really good?

07:18.130 --> 07:20.792
She's good at trying too hard
to be good.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.299
Understandable,
'cause her mom's tj Tyler.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.996
The tj Tyler?
She's got like a trillion grammys.

07:27.105 --> 07:29.038
A trillion and one, I think.

07:29.139 --> 07:30.299
Hi, I'm caitlyn.

07:30.407 --> 07:32.966
Camper today,
top-selling music producer tomorrow.

07:33.075 --> 07:34.133
Check me out.

07:34.243 --> 07:35.972
(Techno beat ts playing)

07:36.445 --> 07:39.004
- Cool. I'm mitchie.
- Hi.

07:41.016 --> 07:42.949
Hi, gang! I'm Dee la Duke,

07:43.050 --> 07:45.450
the musical director here
at camp rock.

07:45.553 --> 07:47.487
All: Hi, Dee.

07:47.588 --> 07:51.318
Here at camp rock we sing.
So let's hear that again.

07:51.424 --> 07:54.221
All: (Singing) Hi, Dee.

07:54.326 --> 07:58.762
Sounds good. A little pitchy in places,
but we'll fix that by the final jam.

07:58.930 --> 08:00.420
(Both beatboxing)

08:00.531 --> 08:01.930
(Rapping)
Hey! We're here to rock it out.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.057
At least I know I am.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.327
We plan to be the winners onstage
at final jam.

08:05.435 --> 08:06.595
- Holler.
- Holler.

08:06.703 --> 08:07.727
Put your hands up.

08:07.838 --> 08:08.997
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, everybody.

08:09.104 --> 08:10.162
Get your hands up.

08:10.272 --> 08:14.230
Okay, okay. Settle down.
You're having too much fun.

08:14.342 --> 08:17.539
Okay, this summer is not just
about the final jam.

08:17.645 --> 08:19.578
We have a lot of work to do.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.545
You're gonna get new music skills,

08:21.648 --> 08:24.844
you're gonna find your sound,
create your own style.

08:24.951 --> 08:26.612
Holler!

08:26.719 --> 08:28.744
And figure out
who you want to be as artists,

08:28.855 --> 08:31.982
but most of all have fun!

08:37.160 --> 08:38.991
And drum roll, please.

08:41.798 --> 08:44.562
For the first time,
we're gonna be joined at camp

08:44.667 --> 08:48.830
by a very special celebrity instructor.

08:49.638 --> 08:51.935
I don't want to waste my summer
at some camp.

08:52.039 --> 08:54.530
I'm Shane gray, for crying out loud.

08:54.642 --> 08:58.099
Hey, man, we used to love this place.
Three years ago we were campers.

08:58.211 --> 09:01.111
Yeah, man,
this is where connect 3 connected.

09:02.915 --> 09:04.610
And you get to see your Uncle brown.

09:04.717 --> 09:06.445
(Scoffing) Not a selling point.

09:06.551 --> 09:08.883
Look, man, right now
you're the bad boy to the press.

09:08.987 --> 09:10.386
And the label has a problem with that.

09:10.488 --> 09:12.352
Which means
we have a problem with that.

09:12.456 --> 09:16.153
Actually, I don't really have a problem
with that.

09:16.259 --> 09:18.784
We have a problem with that.

09:18.895 --> 09:23.661
This camp thing is supposed to fix it.
It's good p.R., so do your time.

09:23.765 --> 09:26.461
Enjoy the fresh air. Get a tan.

09:26.568 --> 09:29.695
Oh, and can you make me a birdhouse
or something?

09:31.138 --> 09:33.731
One word, payback.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.432
That's two words.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.037
(Car engine starting)

09:42.147 --> 09:44.239
By the way, we told the press
you'd be recording a duet

09:44.348 --> 09:45.906
with the winner of final jam.

09:46.017 --> 09:47.109
What?

09:57.959 --> 10:00.655
- Shane! What's the haps, man?
- Hey. What's up, Uncle brown?

10:00.762 --> 10:01.729
Yeah.

10:12.038 --> 10:14.130
Connie:
I hear there's an open Mike tonight.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.866
Yeah.

10:15.974 --> 10:17.271
Are you gonna sing?

10:17.375 --> 10:20.138
In front of all those people? No way.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.712
Sweetie, I hear you in your room.

10:22.813 --> 10:25.372
You're really good. Mom's honor.

10:26.916 --> 10:30.612
And if you're nervous, so what?

10:30.719 --> 10:32.482
Everyone is nervous.

10:32.587 --> 10:34.054
That's why I'm making
so much food tonight,

10:34.155 --> 10:35.952
'cause people eat
when they're nervous.

10:36.057 --> 10:39.423
Not me. I don't think
I can eat another burger ever.

10:40.627 --> 10:43.289
Okay. Why don't you go
take the trash out to the dumpster

10:43.396 --> 10:44.919
and then set up in the mess hall?

10:45.030 --> 10:46.793
I'll finish up here.

10:52.904 --> 10:56.498
Girls: (Singing) You think you're hot
but I'm sorry you're not exactly

10:56.606 --> 10:59.632
who you think you are.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.108
Can't tell you what
what you haven't got.

11:02.211 --> 11:05.441
But when we walk into the room.

11:05.547 --> 11:07.913
Tess: Once again from the top, girls.

11:08.016 --> 11:11.781
You think you're hot
but I'm sorry you're not exactly.

11:11.885 --> 11:14.786
Who you think you are.

11:14.888 --> 11:17.355
Can't tell you what
what you haven't got.

11:17.457 --> 11:19.925
But when we walk into the room

11:20.560 --> 11:21.617
(sighs)

11:22.327 --> 11:24.352
Work with me here, people!

11:24.463 --> 11:26.089
Hello? We're trying, but you...

11:26.197 --> 11:29.496
If we want to win,
you guys have to listen to me.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.862
Let's go again.

11:31.668 --> 11:35.365
You think you're hot
but I'm sorry you're not exactly.

11:35.472 --> 11:38.338
Who you think you are.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.238
Can't tell you what
what you haven't got.

11:41.343 --> 11:42.741
But when we walk into...

11:59.024 --> 12:01.219
Come on, guys. I learned my lesson.

12:01.326 --> 12:04.260
I showered in cold water,
I have looked at a tree.

12:04.361 --> 12:06.454
It's been three hours.
I need hair product.

12:08.631 --> 12:10.496
I guess it's time
to embrace the natural look.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.033
Oh, have fun.

12:12.435 --> 12:13.526
Guys.

12:15.303 --> 12:17.203
Girl: (Squealing) There he is!

12:17.539 --> 12:19.028
(All squealing)

12:24.844 --> 12:26.334
Where'd he go?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.673
(Playing this is me)

12:27.781 --> 12:33.615
(Singing) Do you know what it's like
to feel so in the dark.

12:33.718 --> 12:36.687
To dream about a life.

12:36.788 --> 12:39.449
Where you're the shining star.

12:39.556 --> 12:42.389
Even though it seems.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.585
Like it's too far away

12:45.694 --> 12:49.789
I have to believe in myself.

12:49.898 --> 12:52.389
It's the only way.

12:54.002 --> 12:56.902
This is real, this is me

12:57.004 --> 13:00.939
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be now.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.703
Gonna let the light shine on me.

13:05.811 --> 13:08.712
Now I've found who I am.

13:08.814 --> 13:12.374
There's no way to hold it in.

13:12.483 --> 13:15.043
No more hiding who I want to be

13:15.151 --> 13:17.278
I think he went that way.

13:17.387 --> 13:19.378
This is me.

13:35.635 --> 13:36.760
Hello?

13:38.604 --> 13:39.764
Hello?

13:43.341 --> 13:44.831
Who's in here?

13:54.083 --> 13:57.074
There you are, sweetie.
I've got all the food set up,

13:57.185 --> 13:59.449
so you, princess, are free.

13:59.554 --> 14:01.249
Got to find something to wear.

14:01.356 --> 14:03.949
Honey, it's camp.
It's not a fashion show.

14:04.058 --> 14:06.549
Have you seen these kids?
They have a lot.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.251
My usual is not going to cut it.

14:08.361 --> 14:12.490
Oh, I think you look cute,
in a non-mom way.

14:12.598 --> 14:14.065
Totally.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.601
This, this is safe.

14:17.735 --> 14:19.259
It's also mine.

14:19.370 --> 14:21.600
Honey, wear your own clothes.

14:21.706 --> 14:23.263
You'll be fine.

14:25.509 --> 14:26.874
Be yourself.

14:29.445 --> 14:31.106
Oh, those are pretty.

14:31.614 --> 14:33.581
(Upbeat rock music playing)

14:36.651 --> 14:37.777
Hey, caitlyn.

14:37.886 --> 14:40.319
Hey, mitchie. This is Lola.
Lola, mitchie.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.354
So, is this your first year?

14:42.456 --> 14:44.685
- Yeah. Any advice?
- You're gonna love it here.

14:44.790 --> 14:48.089
And this year, I hear the food
is supposed to be better.

14:48.194 --> 14:49.387
Let's hope.

14:49.494 --> 14:50.552
Dee: Hey, camp rockers!

14:50.662 --> 14:52.323
Next up, let's have
a big camp rock welcome.

14:52.430 --> 14:53.590
Opening night
jam

14:53.698 --> 14:55.858
for Lola Scott!

14:57.768 --> 14:59.200
Wish me luck.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.399
(What it takes playing)

15:03.506 --> 15:07.032
(Singing)
Who's got what it takes to be my guy.

15:07.142 --> 15:09.302
What it takes to make me shine.

15:09.410 --> 15:12.971
What it takes to get me fired up?

15:13.080 --> 15:16.515
Who's got what it takes to be my beau.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.880
What it takes to make me glow.

15:18.985 --> 15:22.476
What it takes to make this beat flow?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.749
Everyone talks about
what they think they need.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.256
They making up a list of things
one, two, three.

15:27.358 --> 15:29.622
Everyone is different
but where we can agree.

15:29.727 --> 15:31.921
Every girl wants her boy
to treat her sweet.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.327
Don't think that being mean
will get you anywhere.

15:34.431 --> 15:36.591
Don't think that acting cool
will make me wanna care

15:36.699 --> 15:38.929
I need your respect
if you're gonna be the one.

15:39.035 --> 15:41.468
And if you must apply
then try to get the job done.

15:41.570 --> 15:45.062
Who's got what it takes to be my guy.

15:45.173 --> 15:47.436
What it takes to make me shine.

15:47.541 --> 15:50.976
What it takes to get me fired up?

15:51.077 --> 15:54.535
Who's got what it takes to be my beau.

15:54.647 --> 15:56.978
What it takes to make me glow.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.483
What it takes to make this beat flow?

16:00.586 --> 16:02.849
I've been contemplating.

16:02.954 --> 16:07.549
What it takes
to make me give my heart.

16:07.657 --> 16:11.184
Could you be the one?

16:11.294 --> 16:16.663
Standing in the crowd
I'm waiting to find out

16:16.765 --> 16:19.494
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, oh.

16:19.601 --> 16:23.092
Who's got what it takes to be my guy.

16:23.203 --> 16:25.467
What it takes to make me shine.

16:25.572 --> 16:28.972
What it takes to get me fired up?

16:29.075 --> 16:32.566
Who's got what it takes to be my beau.

16:32.677 --> 16:34.941
What it takes to make me glow.

16:35.046 --> 16:38.845
What it takes to make this beat flow?

16:47.457 --> 16:49.253
Wow! She's amazing!

16:49.358 --> 16:52.156
Yeah, she should be.
Her mom's on Broadway.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.251
Broadway? Wow.

16:55.329 --> 16:57.490
Yeah, but the kids around here
don't care about that.

16:57.598 --> 16:58.825
It's all about the bling.

16:58.932 --> 17:01.730
That's why Tess over there
runs this camp.

17:04.002 --> 17:07.233
Great. Something wicked
this way comes.

17:07.339 --> 17:08.328
Hey, caitlyn.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.203
Your folks still wowing them
on the cruise ship?

17:11.309 --> 17:14.607
- Actually they work in...
- Hi, I'm mitchie.

17:14.711 --> 17:17.874
Oh, hi. I'm Tess Tyler.

17:17.981 --> 17:22.848
- I know. Wow, I love your mom.
- Of course you do.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.509
I'm mitchie Torres.

17:24.618 --> 17:27.849
Hey, is your dad Nicky Torres,
the composer?

17:27.955 --> 17:29.786
My dad staged one of his shows.

17:29.890 --> 17:30.914
No.

17:31.025 --> 17:34.085
- So what does he do?
- He owns a hardware store.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.327
But my mom...

17:39.432 --> 17:41.695
- Yeah?
- What?

17:41.800 --> 17:45.758
The president of hot tunes tv.

17:45.870 --> 17:46.962
In China.

17:47.071 --> 17:50.301
Yeah, it's a huge market over there.

17:50.407 --> 17:53.240
- Wow. Cool.
- So cool.

17:53.343 --> 17:57.745
Major cool!
Okay, so have you met anybody?

17:57.846 --> 17:59.609
Yeah, like everybody.

17:59.715 --> 18:03.377
Last summer I was in, like,
three music videos.

18:03.484 --> 18:05.111
Yeah, but, I mean,
you could hardly see me.

18:05.219 --> 18:06.310
I was in the back.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.910
- Wow.
- Wow.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.012
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

18:10.123 --> 18:13.353
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.256
What are we thinking?

18:16.328 --> 18:19.593
There's an extra bed in our cabin.
It's yours if you want it.

18:19.698 --> 18:20.995
- Really?
- Totally.

18:21.099 --> 18:25.535
We're gonna be great friends.
Come on, sit with us in the vip section.

18:29.439 --> 18:31.906
I'm good. Thanks for asking.

18:35.143 --> 18:36.974
Can you believe
not one of the cookbooks

18:37.078 --> 18:39.478
has a recipe for chili for 300?

18:39.580 --> 18:42.878
You don't need a recipe.
Everyone loves your food. It's official.

18:42.982 --> 18:45.473
- Really?
- Camper's honor.

18:45.585 --> 18:48.109
So, how was opening night jam?
Did you sing?

18:48.220 --> 18:49.414
No. But I met some girls,

18:49.521 --> 18:51.148
and they want me
to move into their cabin.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.552
And I know I have to help
in the kitchen,

18:52.657 --> 18:54.181
but I'll just get up earlier
and meet you here.

18:54.292 --> 18:56.385
Sweetie, of course you can move
into the cabin.

18:56.494 --> 18:57.983
It'll be fine.

18:58.161 --> 19:02.257
I got to get back to these cookbooks
'cause I got a rep to protect.

19:07.103 --> 19:09.093
(Peggy playing guitar)

19:10.872 --> 19:13.965
Peggy! Could you please stop that?
I can't hear.

19:15.109 --> 19:16.701
Guys.

19:16.810 --> 19:18.505
Which color?

19:18.611 --> 19:21.171
Ella, they're exactly the same.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.373
So you see my dilemma!

19:23.483 --> 19:27.282
Mom? Hey. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm totally settled in.

19:27.386 --> 19:29.512
Guess what? Shane gray is...

19:32.423 --> 19:35.550
Yeah. Yeah,
you can totally call me back.

19:35.658 --> 19:36.989
Love you, too.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.822
Have a good concert.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.862
As usual.

19:41.964 --> 19:43.295
What, Tess?

19:43.399 --> 19:44.831
Hey, guys.

19:44.932 --> 19:46.661
- Hey, mitchie.
- Hey.

19:47.869 --> 19:49.768
So, which bed is mine?

19:49.870 --> 19:51.269
That one.

19:51.371 --> 19:53.931
- But...
- Peggy doesn't mind. Do you?

19:55.241 --> 19:56.606
I guess not.

20:00.879 --> 20:02.073
One bag?

20:02.180 --> 20:05.671
You can't possibly have all your clothes
in there.

20:06.583 --> 20:10.075
Right. Well, I threw a lot
of my clothes away.

20:10.187 --> 20:12.211
Yeah, I just got tired of them.

20:12.321 --> 20:13.948
And you kept this?

20:15.591 --> 20:17.490
Yeah, well, it came from China.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.958
A little boutique called shing sha ji.

20:20.061 --> 20:21.960
- Wow.
- Totally wow.

20:22.062 --> 20:23.427
What does that mean?

20:23.531 --> 20:26.693
Happy summer.
Yeah, that store is the bomb.

20:28.034 --> 20:30.025
Wow! Really cool bracelet.

20:31.303 --> 20:32.429
It's from my mom.

20:32.538 --> 20:36.030
Every time she wins a grammy,
she adds a charm.

20:36.141 --> 20:39.166
Love it. Totally blingalicious.

20:40.044 --> 20:41.943
So, is that your diary?

20:43.547 --> 20:45.310
No. My songs.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.245
You write songs?

20:47.349 --> 20:50.182
Yeah, but they're probably
not that good.

20:50.286 --> 20:51.378
Come on.

20:51.487 --> 20:54.319
Well, I bet they are good.
Let's hear one.

20:54.422 --> 20:57.413
- No.
- Why not? We're friends now, right?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.058
Yeah. Okay.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.728
(Singing) This is real, this is me

21:07.833 --> 21:12.270
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be now.

21:12.370 --> 21:16.032
Gonna let the light shine on...

21:17.475 --> 21:20.637
Yeah, it's not really that good.

21:20.743 --> 21:24.610
What? That was totally good.
Right, Tess?

21:24.713 --> 21:25.907
Totally.

21:31.452 --> 21:33.044
(Alarm clock ringing)

21:59.941 --> 22:01.670
What the...

22:01.776 --> 22:03.607
Mitchie?

22:03.712 --> 22:05.576
You're dreaming.

22:05.679 --> 22:08.477
You're a rock princess.

22:08.582 --> 22:10.981
Okay. I rock.

22:53.084 --> 22:56.019
Hey! Plenty of room over here,
mi amore.

22:56.121 --> 23:00.147
- Yuck. You're going to chase her away.
- As usual.

23:00.257 --> 23:01.814
- Good morning.
- Hey, guys.

23:01.925 --> 23:03.017
- Hey.
- What's up?

23:03.126 --> 23:04.957
Slumming, I see.

23:05.061 --> 23:07.722
- What?
- Hey, mitchie. Over here.

23:07.829 --> 23:10.127
You better go. The queen awaits.

23:11.366 --> 23:13.560
Your music. Are you any good?

23:14.535 --> 23:17.765
I don't know. Maybe. Kind of.

23:17.871 --> 23:18.929
Word of advice.

23:19.039 --> 23:22.270
You wanna be friends with Tess,
don't be.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.568
Mitchie.

23:26.478 --> 23:27.967
See you around.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.883
What happened to you this morning?

23:36.787 --> 23:37.811
Um...

23:38.021 --> 23:39.647
Early riser.

23:39.755 --> 23:41.086
Yum. Toast.

23:44.426 --> 23:46.826
- What?
- Rise and shine, superstar.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.424
- Don't make me do this, Shane.
- Go away.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.127
(Exclaims)

23:54.233 --> 23:56.428
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.401
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.403
Fine. I'm up, okay? I'm up.

24:00.505 --> 24:04.497
All right. We've both got classes
to teach. Yours starts in five.

24:06.377 --> 24:08.937
And you might wanna put that mattress
out in the sun.

24:09.046 --> 24:11.536
It's the only one you're gonna get.

24:12.983 --> 24:14.779
Can you put some water in that vase?

24:14.883 --> 24:16.817
Flowers look parched.

24:16.919 --> 24:18.181
Four minutes!

24:18.654 --> 24:20.280
(Cheering)

24:35.067 --> 24:36.931
Whoa!

24:37.035 --> 24:41.767
If the class is a-rocking,
I'm-a glad I came knocking.

24:41.872 --> 24:44.898
So, let's hear
what I'm working with this year.

24:45.009 --> 24:47.476
- Who wants to sing first?
- Oh! Oh!

24:47.577 --> 24:52.775
My goodness.
All right. Eeny, meeny, miny, you.

24:54.349 --> 24:56.010
Me?

24:56.117 --> 24:57.914
Can't argue with the finger.

24:58.019 --> 24:59.418
I'll do it.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.885
No. The finger picked her.

25:04.791 --> 25:05.951
Well...

25:07.593 --> 25:08.685
Okay.

25:15.366 --> 25:17.060
Right. Let her rip.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.629
(Singing)
Who will I be? It's up to me...

25:23.739 --> 25:28.903
All right. I know you're singing a solo,
but it's so low, I can't hear you.

25:29.010 --> 25:31.035
All right? So, bit louder.

25:36.250 --> 25:40.208
Who will I be? It's up to me.

25:40.319 --> 25:46.746
All the never-ending possibility
that I can see.

25:46.858 --> 25:51.317
There's nothing that I can't do
who will I be?

25:51.429 --> 25:57.298
Yes, I believe I get to make the future
what I want to.

25:57.400 --> 26:02.701
If I can become anyone
and know the choice is up to me.

26:02.805 --> 26:04.738
Who will I be?

26:06.407 --> 26:07.772
She's great.

26:08.476 --> 26:09.840
- That was great.
- That was so amazing.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.401
That's not bad. Not bad at all.
Is that an original?

26:13.513 --> 26:16.208
Yeah, but it's mine, but...

26:16.315 --> 26:20.375
No buts. It's good.
Let me have a high five.

26:20.485 --> 26:22.953
- Oh, thanks.
- All right.

26:23.188 --> 26:26.384
Peggy: I didn't know that you were
that good. You totally rocked it.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.720
- Ella: Totally.
- Thanks.

26:28.826 --> 26:30.258
So, I've been thinking,

26:30.359 --> 26:33.487
and you have to sing with us
in final jam.

26:33.596 --> 26:36.826
Your vocals in the background would
be, like, amazing.

26:37.032 --> 26:42.333
And we never let people in our group.
But you? A must. So you want in?

26:42.436 --> 26:46.132
Well, I was thinking about singing solo
for final jam.

26:46.239 --> 26:49.970
Solo in your first final jam?
That's brave.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.064
You'll be fine.

26:51.176 --> 26:55.509
Well, of course she'll be fine.
It's just that, I know how nervous I get.

26:55.613 --> 26:58.514
Well, I'm sure I'll be nervous
at first, but...

26:58.649 --> 27:01.640
In front of all those people,
but, yeah, you'll be fine.

27:01.752 --> 27:03.982
- You've done it before.
- Done what before?

27:04.087 --> 27:06.577
You've never sang
in front of an audience?

27:06.689 --> 27:10.147
Well, yeah. I mean, choir.
I mean, I was never lead or anything,

27:10.259 --> 27:13.455
and I was sort of in the back,
but it's still an audience.

27:13.561 --> 27:17.428
Wow. You are brave.
Come on, girls. Let's get started.

27:17.531 --> 27:19.897
Well, maybe a group would be better.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.228
If you think so.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.802
Yeah. No, it'll be fun. I want to.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.337
- If you're sure.
- I'm totally sure.

27:28.073 --> 27:30.735
- I gotta run.
- Where?

27:30.842 --> 27:34.834
No. I mean, I got to call my mom.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.310
China time.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.608
Okay, okay. So, here's what...

27:43.252 --> 27:45.743
- Sorry. I'm late.
- Oh. That's okay, honey.

27:45.854 --> 27:47.878
The last batch of cookies
is in the oven.

27:47.989 --> 27:49.047
You can start cleaning up.

27:49.157 --> 27:52.149
I'm gonna take these down
to the storage room.

27:59.765 --> 28:00.925
Hello?

28:03.101 --> 28:04.227
Hello?

28:04.469 --> 28:05.697
(Clattering)

28:06.137 --> 28:07.297
Hello?

28:09.940 --> 28:11.464
I can hear you.

28:18.713 --> 28:19.702
Hi.

28:20.482 --> 28:22.074
Do you work here?

28:24.552 --> 28:26.520
Yes.

28:26.620 --> 28:30.146
Wow. You really get into your work.

28:30.256 --> 28:31.883
I'm Shane.

28:31.991 --> 28:33.822
But I'm sure
even the kitchen help knows that.

28:33.927 --> 28:37.919
- Of course. It's nice to meet you.
- Actually, it's not so nice.

28:38.030 --> 28:40.862
See, my manager said he sent over
my food allergy list,

28:40.965 --> 28:44.866
but since I couldn't even go near
my breakfast this morning...

28:44.968 --> 28:48.495
- Can I just talk to whoever's in charge?
- Excuse me?

28:48.605 --> 28:49.629
What?

28:49.738 --> 28:51.968
Well, you're kind of being a jerk.

28:52.074 --> 28:54.269
- And you are?
- A person!

28:54.376 --> 28:57.902
And there's a way to talk to a person
and that's not it.

29:01.248 --> 29:04.706
Well, I'll have my manager
send it over again.

29:04.818 --> 29:05.909
Fine.

29:09.055 --> 29:10.147
(Clearing throat)

29:11.857 --> 29:13.188
Thank you?

29:14.226 --> 29:15.625
Much better.

29:24.801 --> 29:26.097
Bo y: Yeah, I like that.

29:26.201 --> 29:27.828
I don't need a chaperone, unc.

29:27.936 --> 29:30.905
Seeing how you blew off
your class yesterday, you sort of do.

29:31.006 --> 29:33.064
I didn't sign up for this.

29:33.174 --> 29:36.109
- Get my agent on the phone.
- "Get my agent"?

29:36.210 --> 29:38.268
What happened to you, man?

29:38.378 --> 29:42.040
That kid on that tv,
that's not who you really are.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.547
In there, Shane.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.516
What happened to the kid
who just loved music?

29:47.619 --> 29:50.144
- He grew up.
- Big whoop!

29:50.255 --> 29:52.950
Stop acting like it's all about you.

29:53.056 --> 29:54.785
In my world, it is.

29:56.059 --> 29:59.619
Oh, look. We're in my world.

29:59.729 --> 30:03.459
And in my world, you're considered
an instructor at this camp,

30:03.565 --> 30:06.534
which means you've got to instruct.

30:07.902 --> 30:10.302
Starting with hip-hop dance at 2:00.

30:10.404 --> 30:12.531
And five, six, seven, eight.

30:22.180 --> 30:25.478
Girl: And five, six, seven, eight.

30:25.583 --> 30:29.177
Okay, you guys. Remember,
when he gets here, act cool.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.516
Wait, when who gets here?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.282
Shane.

30:33.390 --> 30:36.881
Wait, he's teaching this class?

30:36.992 --> 30:38.516
Great.

30:38.627 --> 30:41.094
Wait, is that flour in your hair?

30:42.130 --> 30:45.496
No. No, it's Chinese body powder.

30:45.599 --> 30:47.226
Pretty cool, huh?

30:48.835 --> 30:51.701
Grab a Mike and a hat.
Follow me if you can.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.406

Party's never ever gonna stop.

32:36.756 --> 32:39.155
Talk about dancing to the beat
of a different drum.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.050
You any good on the drums?

32:51.134 --> 32:53.227
Man, you're a drummer, dude.

32:54.202 --> 32:55.999
The drummer controls the beat.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.436
The rhythm's in your hands.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.029
Yeah, I guess.

33:00.141 --> 33:02.132
Now we just have to work on getting
that beat from those sticks

33:02.243 --> 33:03.710
to those feet.

33:08.348 --> 33:10.440
Where were you this morning?

33:11.517 --> 33:12.916
(Hesitating)

33:13.252 --> 33:14.980
- Oh, no.
- Hi, girls.

33:15.853 --> 33:16.842
Hi.

33:17.555 --> 33:20.489
Hi. So, yummy breakfast.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.524
Oh. How would you know?

33:22.626 --> 33:24.355
There's hardly anything on your plate.

33:24.461 --> 33:28.157
Morning carbs, definite no-no.

33:28.264 --> 33:29.288
Yeah.

33:29.398 --> 33:32.298
Well, I just wanted
to meet mitchie's new friends.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.334
This is Ella, Peggy, and Tess.

33:34.436 --> 33:35.732
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:35.836 --> 33:37.167
- Hi.
- Hello.

33:41.007 --> 33:44.966
Well, I see you girls are really busy,
so I'll talk to you later.

33:46.912 --> 33:48.743
Okay. Do you know her?

33:49.381 --> 33:50.938
Yeah, don't you?

33:51.048 --> 33:52.538
She's cooked for everybody

33:52.650 --> 33:56.483
from Jessica and Nick pre-breakup
to pharrell.

33:56.586 --> 33:58.281
Really?

33:58.388 --> 34:01.016
Yeah, I'm shocked
the camp even got her.

34:01.124 --> 34:04.490
You mean, Jessica ate these eggs?

34:07.528 --> 34:08.585
Yeah.

34:20.272 --> 34:21.670
That's cool.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.505
- It's like your old stuff.
- Yeah.

34:24.609 --> 34:26.702
I was thinking the group can change up
our sound.

34:26.811 --> 34:28.744
Do some different stuff.

34:29.146 --> 34:31.011
So you coming up to the campfire?

34:31.114 --> 34:32.741
Yeah, right.

34:32.849 --> 34:35.976
All right. Well, you sit in here
by yourself, superstar.

34:36.085 --> 34:38.416
'Cause you're right. Way cooler.

34:53.665 --> 34:56.327
So, your friends, they seem nice.

34:57.269 --> 35:00.294
Tess is interesting.

35:00.404 --> 35:02.929
I know, but she's better
once you get to know her.

35:03.040 --> 35:07.442
Yeah? And have you?
Have you gotten to know her?

35:07.544 --> 35:09.408
Yeah. I guess.

35:09.545 --> 35:12.412
I don't know. She just doesn't seem
like she's your type, you know.

35:12.515 --> 35:15.039
- You've always been so...
- Invisible.

35:16.584 --> 35:18.848
I was going to say independent.

35:21.622 --> 35:25.751
Hurry up and finish those potatoes
if you wanna get to the campfire.

35:30.695 --> 35:34.631
So we call this the campfire jam.
It's about expression.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.530
The freedom to be
who you really wanna be.

35:39.370 --> 35:40.563
Hit it!

35:40.670 --> 35:42.035
(All cheering)

35:52.680 --> 35:54.341
(Too cool playing)

35:58.685 --> 36:02.120
(Singing) I'm too cool for my dress
these shades don't leave my head.

36:02.221 --> 36:05.418
Everything you say is so irrelevant.

36:05.524 --> 36:08.583
You follow and I lead
you wanna be like me.

36:08.693 --> 36:13.391
But you're just a wannabe
love it or hate it.

36:13.497 --> 36:16.795
Me, myself, and I agree.

36:16.899 --> 36:19.663
You'll never catch up with me.

36:19.769 --> 36:21.759
'Cause I'm too cool.

36:21.870 --> 36:23.098
Too cool.

36:23.205 --> 36:27.368
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you.

36:27.474 --> 36:30.671
Don't take it personal
don't get emotional.

36:30.778 --> 36:34.372
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you.

36:34.480 --> 36:38.176
You think you're hot
but I'm sorry you're not exactly

36:38.283 --> 36:41.013
who you think you are.

36:41.119 --> 36:43.985
Can't tell you what
what you haven't got.

36:44.088 --> 36:48.353
But when we walk into the room
I'm too cool for you.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.926
You see some are born
with beauty brains and talent.

36:51.027 --> 36:53.153
And they got it all.

36:55.197 --> 36:57.858
While others have to try all their lives.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.935
Still they never get the call.

37:02.203 --> 37:05.228
That's the difference
between you and me.

37:05.339 --> 37:07.807
Obviously

37:08.741 --> 37:12.837
I'm a natural, I'm the real deal

37:13.945 --> 37:17.244
I can't help the way I am.

37:17.349 --> 37:20.112
Hope you don't misunderstand.

37:20.217 --> 37:22.185
But I'm too cool.

37:22.286 --> 37:23.583
Too cool.

37:23.687 --> 37:27.816
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you.

37:27.924 --> 37:31.154
Don't take it personal
don't get emotional.

37:31.260 --> 37:35.320
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you

37:35.863 --> 37:37.990
(all cheering)

37:54.379 --> 37:56.573
Did you enjoy singing backup?

38:13.527 --> 38:14.494
(Coughs)

38:14.628 --> 38:16.322
Can't a guy get some peace?

38:16.429 --> 38:17.555
Sorry.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.027
- Sorry.
- You said that already.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.290
I'm sorry. I...

38:24.503 --> 38:27.994
Was that you playing?
It sounded kind of different.

38:28.105 --> 38:31.040
Than my usual stupid cookie-cutter
pop star stuff?

38:31.142 --> 38:34.338
- Sorry to disappoint.
- You didn't.

38:34.477 --> 38:35.603
I liked it.

38:35.712 --> 38:39.442
I mean, it was good
for stupid cookie-cutter pop star stuff.

38:41.616 --> 38:44.176
Wow, you really know
how to make a guy feel better.

38:44.285 --> 38:46.651
I thought you loved your sound.
You created it.

38:46.754 --> 38:49.984
- You're like a camp rock legend.
- Some legend.

38:50.090 --> 38:54.150
I only played the music
that the label thinks will sell. That's it.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.660
You don't think that song would sell?

38:56.762 --> 38:58.194
I don't know.

38:59.230 --> 39:01.994
Well, you'll never know if you don't try.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.334
And, by the way, I know of one girl
that would buy that song.

39:16.144 --> 39:17.736
Oh, I'm so sorry!

39:19.146 --> 39:21.376
Actually, I'm so not.

39:22.350 --> 39:23.373
I would respond, but...

39:23.483 --> 39:26.418
But you are responding
by saying that you're not responding.

39:26.519 --> 39:28.146
Shut up.

39:31.924 --> 39:33.618
Okay, that was on purpose.

39:33.725 --> 39:37.718
Doesn't matter.
Anything makes that outfit look better.

39:37.829 --> 39:39.455
See?

39:39.563 --> 39:41.155
Okay.

39:41.264 --> 39:43.755
- Nice, caitlyn.
- Good shot.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.960
Stop. Hey, no, you guys, stop!

39:48.137 --> 39:50.161
- Stop.
- My spaghetti slipped.

39:50.271 --> 39:52.239
I can't believe you did that!

39:52.340 --> 39:53.830
Neither can I.

39:55.376 --> 39:56.536
Sander: Busted.

40:05.917 --> 40:08.215
I hate when I have to be uncool.

40:12.890 --> 40:13.914
Lay it on me.

40:14.024 --> 40:15.513
- She's always been jealous of me...
- She's impossible.

40:15.625 --> 40:18.093
And she cannot stand the fact
that I'm probably to win final jam,

40:18.194 --> 40:20.559
- so she spilled...
- Whoa!

40:20.662 --> 40:23.222
Enough. Make it plain.

40:23.332 --> 40:26.198
Who was the first one to throw food?

40:26.300 --> 40:28.097
That's easy. Caitlyn.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.403
- That's technically true, but...
- No buts.

40:40.279 --> 40:42.872
Since you wanna play with food,

40:42.981 --> 40:45.848
I can hook you up
with a job this summer.

40:45.950 --> 40:49.043
From here on out,
you're on kitchen duty.

40:49.153 --> 40:50.916
What? I mean...

40:52.989 --> 40:54.013
Ew.

40:56.225 --> 40:58.317
- But...
- Again with the buts.

41:00.328 --> 41:02.022
Look, it's settled.

41:04.165 --> 41:05.632
Happy cooking.

41:07.534 --> 41:08.967
Thanks a lot.

41:18.776 --> 41:21.438
- Oh!
- You hungry?

41:21.546 --> 41:23.172
Just a little bit.

41:24.247 --> 41:26.010
Do you have a second?

41:26.450 --> 41:27.678
Um...

41:29.285 --> 41:29.952
- Sure.
- I wanna run something by you.

41:29.953 --> 41:31.817
- Sure.
- I wanna run something by you.

41:37.125 --> 41:39.319
(Playing gotta find you)

41:45.398 --> 41:51.029
(Singing) Every time I think
I'm closer to the heart.

41:51.136 --> 41:56.539
Of what it means to know
just who I am

41:57.041 --> 42:01.477
I think I finally found
a better place to start.

42:02.879 --> 42:07.474
But no one ever seems to understand

42:09.417 --> 42:13.285
I need to try to get to where you are.

42:14.654 --> 42:18.988
Could it be you're not that far?

42:19.092 --> 42:22.424
You're the voice I hear inside my head.

42:22.528 --> 42:24.655
The reason that I'm singing

42:24.763 --> 42:27.526
I need to find you

42:27.632 --> 42:30.327
I got to find you.

42:31.435 --> 42:36.497
You're the missing piece
I need the song inside of me

42:36.606 --> 42:39.166
I need to find you

42:39.275 --> 42:41.708
I got to find you

42:44.312 --> 42:48.714
I've been feeling lost
can't find the words to say.

42:49.717 --> 42:54.619
Spending all my time
stuck in yesterday.

42:56.388 --> 43:00.415
Where you are is where I wanna be.

43:01.559 --> 43:07.588
Oh, next to you, and you next to me.

43:09.165 --> 43:14.067
Oh, I need to find you.

43:17.672 --> 43:21.005
You're the voice I hear inside my head.

43:21.109 --> 43:26.307
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you

43:26.413 --> 43:29.939
I got to find you.

43:30.049 --> 43:35.042
You're the missing piece
I need the song inside of me

43:35.153 --> 43:38.019
I need to find you

43:38.122 --> 43:40.590
I got to find you.

43:44.027 --> 43:45.085
Wow.

43:47.397 --> 43:48.886
I heard this girl singing,

43:48.997 --> 43:51.431
and it kind of reminded me
of the music that I liked.

43:51.533 --> 43:53.864
So I started playing around
with some chords, and...

43:53.968 --> 43:57.460
- I know it's not finished, but...
- No. No, it's good.

43:57.605 --> 44:00.004
It's really good. And I don't lie.

44:05.244 --> 44:07.735
Why are you looking at me like that?

44:07.846 --> 44:09.540
I don't know.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.376
You seem different.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.840
Good different.

44:16.186 --> 44:19.746
Yeah. Definitely different.

44:25.994 --> 44:29.020
So, I better get going.

44:29.130 --> 44:31.097
Back to the kitchen?

44:31.198 --> 44:34.167
- What?
- To get some dip for these chips?

44:35.134 --> 44:36.965
(Laughing) Oh!

44:37.070 --> 44:40.266
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

44:52.882 --> 44:55.350
Hey, mom, how you doing?

44:55.452 --> 44:57.749
I'm all right. How are you?

44:57.853 --> 45:01.583
I am great.
I'm wonderful, I'm fantastic, I'm...

45:01.689 --> 45:04.180
- Putting chips into bowls...
- Right.

45:07.628 --> 45:08.652
Hey, Mrs. Torres.

45:08.762 --> 45:11.559
Hi, caitlyn. Thanks for coming in early.

45:11.664 --> 45:13.598
Taco night takes
the entire kitchen staff

45:13.699 --> 45:15.360
and our six hands.

45:16.234 --> 45:17.394
Six?

45:17.502 --> 45:19.197
Yeah. My daughter.

45:19.304 --> 45:21.272
So can you please start in
on the onions?

45:21.373 --> 45:24.535
Brown wants to talk to me
about next week's campfire pig-out.

45:24.642 --> 45:25.734
Sure.

45:28.611 --> 45:31.045
Hey! You must be hands five and six.

45:31.147 --> 45:34.309
I didn't know Connie had a daughter.
I'm caitlyn.

45:36.318 --> 45:38.148
Do you need some help?

45:43.790 --> 45:44.984
Mitchie?

45:46.126 --> 45:47.558
Wait a minute.

45:47.660 --> 45:51.096
You're the cook's daughter.
She's your mom.

45:51.196 --> 45:53.663
Oh, this is rich.

45:53.765 --> 45:55.995
But apparently you're not.

45:56.100 --> 46:00.468
So what are you waiting for, huh?
Run. Go tell everybody.

46:00.570 --> 46:03.595
- Maybe I should.
- Fine. Whatever.

46:03.706 --> 46:07.233
How long did you think
you could keep your little secret?

46:08.476 --> 46:10.034
Longer than this.

46:10.145 --> 46:11.169
Why?

46:12.347 --> 46:14.314
- Why do you care?
- Oh, I don't.

46:14.415 --> 46:16.940
But when I tell everybody,
I want the whole backstory.

46:17.051 --> 46:19.644
I just wanted to fit in, okay?

46:19.752 --> 46:23.244
I think your whole charade is stupid
and immature.

46:23.356 --> 46:25.880
You're hiding behind some crazy lie.

46:28.393 --> 46:31.259
What about you, huh? You hide, too!

46:31.362 --> 46:34.159
The whole
"I don't care about anything" attitude?

46:34.264 --> 46:37.097
Well, if you don't care,
why are you here?

46:40.035 --> 46:42.401
What happened to you?

46:43.872 --> 46:46.066
She got drowned in her lies.

46:46.174 --> 46:47.664
What, caitlyn?

46:49.710 --> 46:50.904
Nothing.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.907
- Caitlyn, wait!
- No, no, no, no. You can talk later.

46:56.015 --> 46:59.473
First you got to get out
of these wet clothes. Come on.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.586
Says here in this magazine
I'm Shane's type.

47:03.688 --> 47:06.451
It's just a matter of time.

47:06.557 --> 47:09.424
"Warm, funny, talented."

47:09.526 --> 47:11.652
You? I don't get it.

47:13.596 --> 47:16.860
- Hey, guys, what are you doing?
- The question is, what were you doing?

47:16.965 --> 47:19.627
- You're always awol.
- What?

47:19.768 --> 47:22.327
Hey, mitchie, I was thinking.

47:22.436 --> 47:25.769
After camp, maybe we could come
to visit you and your mom in China

47:25.873 --> 47:28.397
and go to that happy summer store.

47:28.508 --> 47:30.703
Sure. My mom would like that.

47:33.846 --> 47:36.337
Okay, guys.
Tonight is the pajama jam.

47:36.447 --> 47:40.110
So, outfit check.
White shorts and green hoodies.

47:41.419 --> 47:44.046
What? Green is Shane's favorite color.

47:45.222 --> 47:47.121
It was in the magazine.

48:01.401 --> 48:04.528
- All right!
- The other lemmings are over there.

48:04.637 --> 48:07.367
- Look, caitlyn, about what...
- Save it, mitchie.

48:07.473 --> 48:09.667
If that's even your real name.

48:14.145 --> 48:15.407
- Hey.
- Hi.

48:19.015 --> 48:20.505
Are we ready?

48:20.617 --> 48:22.585
Where are your t-shirt and shorts?

48:22.719 --> 48:25.915
Yeah, I thought that we were supposed
to wear the same thing?

48:26.021 --> 48:28.046
The backup singers should wear
the same thing.

48:28.157 --> 48:30.215
Not the lead singer, hello!

48:30.958 --> 48:35.394
Next, give it up for the awesome
caitlyn geller!

48:38.598 --> 48:41.725
And this is in honor
of you awesome camp rockers.

48:44.235 --> 48:46.066
(Electronic music playing)

48:55.344 --> 48:56.971
She's really good.

48:58.247 --> 49:00.271
Hey. Shane likes her, too.

49:05.019 --> 49:07.487
Help! Help, there's a snake! Snake!

49:09.824 --> 49:12.587
It's just the power cord
to the sound system, Tess.

49:12.692 --> 49:15.455
Oh. Right. My bad.

49:18.130 --> 49:20.757
- You are so full of it!
- What?

49:20.898 --> 49:22.991
You can't stand
that people might actually like

49:23.100 --> 49:24.897
what other people do.

49:26.069 --> 49:27.297
Okay. What is that?

49:27.404 --> 49:31.840
She said, "whatever, major loser."

49:33.809 --> 49:37.335
Oh, wow, Tess.
"Whatever, major loser?"

49:37.445 --> 49:41.847
That is so last year.
I mean, everyone knows that.

49:41.949 --> 49:45.749
Oh, well, I guess not everyone.

49:46.385 --> 49:48.410
(All murmuring)

50:01.931 --> 50:04.456
Hey! Does this look like a record, girls?

50:04.567 --> 50:05.556
Huh?

50:05.668 --> 50:08.830
I mean, a cd.
Does this cookie look like a cd?

50:08.937 --> 50:12.997
'Cause I want it to look authentic
next to my eighth note cupcakes.

50:13.875 --> 50:15.934
Everything looks great, Connie.

50:16.043 --> 50:18.237
These theme nights are so busy, huh?

50:18.345 --> 50:21.143
Oh, I gotta go get the ice cream
for my rolling stone cones!

50:21.248 --> 50:22.714
See you later.

50:23.749 --> 50:26.149
So, did you sign up for final jam?

50:27.886 --> 50:28.978
Yeah.

50:30.188 --> 50:32.679
So, what are you thinking about doing?

50:32.790 --> 50:35.383
This is freaking me out.
Why are we talking?

50:35.492 --> 50:38.086
I don't know. Maybe I'm slumming?

50:40.863 --> 50:43.524
Or maybe I wanted to set
you up for that!

50:44.032 --> 50:45.192
My gosh.

50:50.337 --> 50:53.737
So, thank you for yesterday, but...

50:53.840 --> 50:56.468
Hey. I always stick up for my friends.

50:56.576 --> 50:58.941
It's fun being friends with Tess.

50:59.378 --> 51:00.936
How would you know?

51:01.046 --> 51:06.108
Because I was friends with Tess.
I know, it's hard to believe.

51:06.217 --> 51:09.015
More like impossible. What happened?

51:09.719 --> 51:13.052
Tess doesn't like competition,
and she felt I was.

51:13.156 --> 51:16.249
See, with her, there can only be
one star. Herself.

51:17.393 --> 51:19.883
Look, I know it's fun being
friends with her.

51:19.994 --> 51:24.727
She can make you feel so important
and she's popular, but so what?

51:24.832 --> 51:28.323
Oh, come on.
Being popular is so not a "so what."

51:29.236 --> 51:30.964
No, there are perks.

51:31.337 --> 51:33.669
Like... well, like...

51:34.073 --> 51:36.563
Like singing backup to Tess
all the time?

51:36.675 --> 51:39.303
Like never getting to say
what you really feel?

51:39.411 --> 51:42.140
Oh, and those exciting short outfits?

51:42.947 --> 51:46.746
Those were real high points.
You're right. Sell your soul.

51:48.551 --> 51:50.451
Hey. I'm on your side.

51:51.553 --> 51:54.613
Oh, shoot.
I was supposed to go meet up with...

51:55.891 --> 51:58.154
We're practicing for final jam.

51:58.759 --> 52:01.091
Of course. Her highness awaits.

52:05.699 --> 52:08.565
(Singing) Hand-clapping,
hip-shaking...

52:08.667 --> 52:10.362
(Cell phone ringing)

52:10.602 --> 52:11.625
Hello?

52:11.736 --> 52:13.203
Hey, buddy,
how's my birdhouse coming?

52:13.304 --> 52:14.737
- Jason!
- Sorry. It's not my fault

52:14.839 --> 52:15.931
you didn't ask him to
make you anything.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.700
- I didn't want anything.
- Well, I wanted a birdhouse! So what?

52:17.808 --> 52:18.775
And what do you need a birdhouse for?

52:18.875 --> 52:20.069
Because I wanted to see
more birds in...

52:20.177 --> 52:21.804
Guys. Guys.

52:21.912 --> 52:23.003
Both: Sorry.

52:23.112 --> 52:24.943
Listen. About me recording
with a camper.

52:25.047 --> 52:27.776
- You gotta do it, man. No go-backs.
- Yeah. No go-backs.

52:27.882 --> 52:29.076
It's, like, the golden rule.

52:29.184 --> 52:30.947
No, dude, the golden rule
is "tell the truth."

52:31.052 --> 52:32.450
Dude, then it can be, like,
the silver rule.

52:32.553 --> 52:34.646
- Why is it the silver rule?
- Okay, fine, the copper rule.

52:34.755 --> 52:36.416
- The copper rule?
- Well, give me tin at least.

52:36.523 --> 52:37.580
Guys.

52:37.790 --> 52:39.121
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

52:39.225 --> 52:41.090
Listen. I've been thinking about
the whole recording thing,

52:41.194 --> 52:42.990
and I think it's really cool.

52:43.095 --> 52:44.426
Are you getting too much sun?

52:44.529 --> 52:46.554
'Cause we can bring you a hat
when we come to visit.

52:46.665 --> 52:51.328
I'm fine. And remember, whoever wins,
no go-backs. See you guys Saturday.

52:54.371 --> 52:55.895
Now I just have to find that girl
with the voice.

52:57.707 --> 53:01.073
Hey, Andy! Buddy.
You wanna do me a favor?

53:01.510 --> 53:02.534
Sure.

53:03.379 --> 53:05.107
(Start the party playing)

53:09.583 --> 53:11.574
Shane gray is looking for the girl
with the voice.

53:11.685 --> 53:15.415
Start, start, start the party
come on, come on, everyone.

53:15.521 --> 53:19.854
Let's sta-sta-start the party
what you waiting for now?

53:19.958 --> 53:21.619
Let's start, let's start
let's start the party.

53:21.726 --> 53:23.694
- Hey.
- Come on, come on, live it up.

53:23.795 --> 53:27.890
Let's start-start-start the party
I know you're never gonna wanna stop.

53:27.998 --> 53:30.261
(Singing)
Let's start, start, start the party.

53:30.366 --> 53:32.061
Come on, come on, everyone.

53:32.168 --> 53:36.467
Let's start, start, start the party
what you waiting for now?

53:36.571 --> 53:38.539
Start, start, start the party.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.664
(Singing) Start, start, start the party.

53:40.775 --> 53:42.140
Come on, come on, everyone.

53:42.243 --> 53:46.110
(In slavic accent) Let's start, start
what you waiting for?

53:46.212 --> 53:47.611
(Singing)
Here we go so let your flow show.

53:47.714 --> 53:50.307
Make the dreams you have
become real.

53:50.416 --> 53:52.509
Let's do this, let me hear you.

53:52.618 --> 53:54.210
Show me how you feel.

53:54.319 --> 53:58.049
(Singing) Start, start, start the party
come on, come on, everyone.

53:58.156 --> 54:00.351
Let's start, start, start the party.

54:00.458 --> 54:01.822
Girls: (Singing)
I know you're never gonna wanna stop.

54:01.925 --> 54:08.227
Let the music take us to paradise.

54:08.330 --> 54:10.059
Let's close our eyes.

54:10.166 --> 54:15.000
Feel the groove wanna shake us.

54:15.103 --> 54:16.694
Aren't you gonna get in line?

54:16.804 --> 54:20.296
Oh, it's not me. Trust.
Anyway, he's never heard me sing.

54:22.508 --> 54:25.102
(Singing) Turn on that radio.

54:25.211 --> 54:28.202
As loud as it can go.

54:28.313 --> 54:32.180
Gotta dance until my feet
can't feel the ground.

54:34.185 --> 54:36.949
So, does your voice sound better
over here?

54:37.754 --> 54:41.451
Why don't we get in one of these things
and you can tell me.

54:43.292 --> 54:45.658
- Mitchie: Really?
- Yeah. It was awesome.

54:47.495 --> 54:48.553
Mitchie: Yeah.

54:50.731 --> 54:52.755
(Laughing) I don't think
we're doing this right.

54:52.866 --> 54:55.460
What? You don't like going in circles?

54:58.370 --> 55:01.339
So, have you found
your special girl yet?

55:02.274 --> 55:03.774
Why? Are you jealous?

55:03.775 --> 55:04.173
Why? Are you jealous?

55:04.275 --> 55:05.902
- Jerk.
- Hey.

55:06.010 --> 55:09.035
Being a jerk is a part
of the rock star image.

55:09.813 --> 55:12.213
Keeping up an image can be tiring.

55:12.516 --> 55:14.642
But it keeps the posers away.

55:15.518 --> 55:20.216
I never know if people are hanging with
me for the free stuff or for the parties.

55:20.322 --> 55:22.483
Oh. Definitely the free stuff.

55:22.591 --> 55:23.580
Funny.

55:23.692 --> 55:25.659
Come on.
I know you're really not a jerk.

55:25.759 --> 55:28.091
I mean, you're helping Andy
with his dancing,

55:28.195 --> 55:31.027
and those screaming girls
seem to like you.

55:31.131 --> 55:33.122
Which brings me back
to the whole jealous thing.

55:33.233 --> 55:35.598
I take that back. You are a jerk.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.930
(Mitchie and Shane laughing)

55:49.646 --> 55:52.409
- It must be the same for you, too, huh?
- What?

55:52.515 --> 55:55.039
Because of your mom,
and her job at hot tunes.

55:55.150 --> 55:57.482
People probably are always
fake around you.

55:57.585 --> 56:00.553
Yeah. Right. Totally.

56:02.089 --> 56:05.387
You know, it's nice talking
to someone who gets it.

56:05.491 --> 56:08.426
Yeah. Me, too.

56:17.868 --> 56:20.302
Seriously, mom.
Okay, we're done with the dishes.

56:20.404 --> 56:21.995
Okay, girls, have fun at the campfire.

56:22.105 --> 56:23.299
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks.

56:23.406 --> 56:25.931
- I love you, mom.
- Love you, too. Bye!

56:33.181 --> 56:35.046
Camp rock
beach jam

56:36.616 --> 56:38.709
- hey, gang.
- Bo y: We love you, brown!

56:38.818 --> 56:41.843
Whoa! All right, all right. Kids.

56:41.954 --> 56:43.751
Okay, score.

56:44.223 --> 56:49.455
I finally talked my nephew
into singing us a song!

56:54.198 --> 56:56.826
Shane, rock the camp!

56:58.367 --> 57:00.858
Hey, guys. I got a surprise for you.

57:02.671 --> 57:04.298
Guys, come on out.

57:15.982 --> 57:19.542
So we're gonna play something new.
Let us know what you think.

57:20.752 --> 57:22.879
(Playing play my music)

57:23.754 --> 57:25.312
(Singing) Music

57:25.823 --> 57:31.260
I turn on that radio
as loud as it can go.

57:31.361 --> 57:34.693
Wanna dance until my feet
can't feel the ground.

57:34.797 --> 57:36.492
Can't feel the ground.

57:36.599 --> 57:42.002
Say goodbye to all my fears
one good song, they disappear.

57:42.103 --> 57:45.560
And nothing in the world
can bring me down.

57:45.672 --> 57:47.401
Can bring me down.

57:48.075 --> 57:50.668
Hand-clapping
hip-shaking.

57:50.776 --> 57:53.336
Heartbreaking there's no faking.

57:53.446 --> 57:58.678
What you feel
when you ride it home, yeah.

57:58.783 --> 58:04.152
Music's in my soul
I can hear it.

58:04.255 --> 58:06.745
Every day and every night.

58:06.856 --> 58:09.552
It's the one thing on my mind.

58:09.659 --> 58:13.116
Music's got control.

58:13.228 --> 58:17.561
And I'm never letting go, no, no

58:17.665 --> 58:21.794
I just wanna play my music.

58:23.169 --> 58:24.727
Music.

58:25.405 --> 58:31.103
Got my six-string on my back
don't need anything but that.

58:31.209 --> 58:34.303
Everything I want is here with me.

58:34.412 --> 58:36.072
Here with me.

58:36.179 --> 58:41.343
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far.

58:41.450 --> 58:46.978
And what's driving me is
following my dreams, yeah.

58:47.489 --> 58:49.980
Hand-clapping
earth-shaking.

58:50.091 --> 58:52.752
Heartbreaking there's no faking.

58:52.860 --> 58:56.761
What you feel
when you're on a roll.

58:56.863 --> 58:58.125
Yeah, yeah.

58:58.231 --> 59:01.996
Music's in my soul

59:02.100 --> 59:03.499
I can hear it.

59:03.602 --> 59:06.162
Every day and every night.

59:06.271 --> 59:08.898
It's the one thing on my mind.

59:09.006 --> 59:12.497
Music's got control.

59:12.609 --> 59:16.978
And I'm never letting go, no, no

59:17.080 --> 59:19.604
I just wanna play my music

59:19.715 --> 59:23.309
I just wanna play my music.

59:23.418 --> 59:25.613
Can't imagine what it'd be like.

59:25.720 --> 59:26.812
What it'd be like.

59:26.921 --> 59:32.790
Without the sound of all my heroes
singing all my favorite songs.

59:32.893 --> 59:35.918
So I can sing along.

59:36.028 --> 59:41.260
Music's in my soul
I can hear it.

59:41.366 --> 59:43.925
Every day every night.

59:44.034 --> 59:46.730
It's the one thing on my mind.

59:46.837 --> 59:50.328
Music's got control.

59:50.440 --> 59:54.773
And I'm never letting go, no, no

59:54.876 --> 59:57.504
I just wanna play my music.

59:57.612 --> 01:00:01.411
Music's in my soul

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:02.948
I can hear it.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.540
Every day and every night.

01:00:05.652 --> 01:00:08.212
It's the one thing on my mind.

01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:11.812
Music's got control.

01:00:11.924 --> 01:00:16.292
And I'm never letting go, no, no

01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:19.124
I just wanna play my music.

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.959
All night long.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.226
Yeah!

01:00:40.546 --> 01:00:42.309
Man, they loved it. You were right.

01:00:42.415 --> 01:00:44.713
I know I was right. What did I do?

01:00:44.817 --> 01:00:48.274
Not you. Shane.
The label has to let us do this.

01:00:48.387 --> 01:00:50.446
They won't. Look at what they made us
call the band.

01:00:50.555 --> 01:00:53.148
Yeah! How can we do that?

01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:55.686
If we hit the studio tonight, we can
get them a demo by tomorrow.

01:00:55.793 --> 01:00:57.225
I mean, they can't say no
once they hear this.

01:00:57.327 --> 01:00:58.385
They can't?

01:00:58.528 --> 01:01:02.019
Guys, I can't just leave.
I'm not finished here yet.

01:01:02.131 --> 01:01:03.723
All right, man. Do what you gotta do.

01:01:03.832 --> 01:01:05.800
We are talking about finishing
my birdhouse, right?

01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:08.892
- Come on! See you at final jam.
- Bye.

01:01:11.205 --> 01:01:12.694
Bo y: Off the chain. That was so great.

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:16.099
Mitchie: That was the best song ever.
It was so great.

01:01:16.209 --> 01:01:19.109
- That was so amazing. And...
- I know, he was so...

01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:20.604
Did you see them?

01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:24.148
Hey, mitchie.
Tell us about your mom again.

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:29.819
Her mom is a great person.
What's your mom like?

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:32.179
She's like a mom.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:38.124
I mean, I know she's the president
of hot tunes tv China,

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.629
but tell me again about
how important she is.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:42.923
She...

01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:46.023
I'm sorry. What?

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:49.763
She's pretty cool.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.596
And...

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:59.868
And she's not the president
of hot tunes tv China.

01:02:00.912 --> 01:02:04.677
What's that? She's not president?

01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:08.211
You mean, you lied to everybody?

01:02:08.618 --> 01:02:09.606
No. I was...

01:02:09.718 --> 01:02:13.085
So, she's what? A vice president?
Treasurer?

01:02:13.189 --> 01:02:14.246
Tess.

01:02:14.389 --> 01:02:18.223
Shut up. Go on. Tell us.

01:02:20.227 --> 01:02:21.285
No.

01:02:22.563 --> 01:02:25.224
- She's a cook.
- A cook?

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.892
At hot tunes China.

01:02:29.634 --> 01:02:30.794
No.

01:02:32.037 --> 01:02:33.129
Here.

01:02:34.339 --> 01:02:35.771
So you lied.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.902
Your mom cooks our food,
and you help her.

01:02:40.977 --> 01:02:43.605
That's the only way you could
afford this camp, right?

01:02:43.713 --> 01:02:45.771
You're a real jerk.

01:02:45.881 --> 01:02:49.476
Maybe. But at least
I'm not a big, fat liar.

01:02:50.785 --> 01:02:52.275
Come on, guys.

01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:53.580
Mitchie.

01:02:54.755 --> 01:02:57.780
Mitchie has dishes to do. Let's go.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.014
Shane.

01:03:01.126 --> 01:03:02.889
- You were lying all summer?
- Yes, but I...

01:03:02.995 --> 01:03:05.589
You know, I'm so used to
people pretending around me.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:08.791
- I was not pretending!
- And I really thought you were different.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.561
But you're just like everyone else.

01:03:10.668 --> 01:03:14.034
You wanted to be friends
with Shane gray, not me.

01:03:14.137 --> 01:03:16.730
- Trick's on me, huh?
- I was just trying...

01:03:16.839 --> 01:03:20.240
Save it for your interview
with pop informer magazine.

01:03:20.943 --> 01:03:23.035
I know I gave you an earful.

01:03:25.914 --> 01:03:28.040
Not here, you don't. Come on.

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:49.058
So what exactly happened last night?

01:03:49.165 --> 01:03:50.530
Nothing.

01:03:50.634 --> 01:03:54.228
Didn't look like nothing to me, mate.
You look crushed.

01:03:54.336 --> 01:03:56.964
Pummeled. Absolutely destroyed.

01:03:57.072 --> 01:03:58.902
I got it, Uncle brown.

01:03:59.607 --> 01:04:01.370
Look, whatever.

01:04:02.143 --> 01:04:05.339
I'm just gonna focus on my music.
Change my sound.

01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:08.971
I don't wanna get sidetracked
with liking someone anyway.

01:04:10.182 --> 01:04:12.309
You still looking for that girl?

01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:13.441
What?

01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:16.279
I'm plugged into the
camp gossip, mate.

01:04:17.222 --> 01:04:20.315
It's crazy.
I have her song stuck in my head.

01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:23.553
(Singing) This is real
this is me

01:04:23.661 --> 01:04:27.756
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be now.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.797
Gonna let the light.

01:04:41.942 --> 01:04:44.069
Mitchie's songs.

01:04:44.177 --> 01:04:46.303
"This is real, this is me,

01:04:46.412 --> 01:04:49.176
"I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

01:04:49.281 --> 01:04:51.840
"Gonna let the light shine on me."

01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:02.055
Mitchie, you are so never
going to see final jam.

01:05:14.635 --> 01:05:16.431
What a joke.

01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:24.868
Tess: (Whispering) "I hope you
don't misunderstand. I'm just too cool."

01:05:24.977 --> 01:05:28.139
You know? I mean,
"I'm like too over you."

01:05:28.245 --> 01:05:30.008
You know what I mean?

01:05:30.948 --> 01:05:33.279
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

01:05:38.887 --> 01:05:41.719
So, final jam is coming up,
and I know you're all very excited.

01:05:41.823 --> 01:05:44.189
All: Yeah! You know it!

01:05:45.326 --> 01:05:47.122
So here's some advice.

01:05:49.596 --> 01:05:51.791
It's not all about your image.

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:56.733
None of it means anything unless
people see who you really are.

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:01.237
And your music has to be
who you really are.

01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:06.475
It's gotta show how you feel.
Or it doesn't mean anything.

01:06:11.948 --> 01:06:14.745
I didn't know you felt so ashamed
of yourself.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.545
I'm not ashamed.

01:06:16.652 --> 01:06:20.348
It's just, for once, I just wanted
to fit in and be popular.

01:06:20.454 --> 01:06:23.513
What do you mean?
You have plenty of friends at home.

01:06:23.623 --> 01:06:27.389
I have one. And the last time I checked,
no one was busting their butts

01:06:27.494 --> 01:06:31.224
to sit next to us at the lunch table.
And when I got here I just...

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:35.459
I just wanted it to be different.
You know? Just once.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.471
My sweetie, you are so much
more than you can see.

01:06:41.571 --> 01:06:44.630
You don't have to lie about
who or what you are.

01:06:45.574 --> 01:06:48.338
I'm not just saying it
'cause I'm your mom!

01:06:48.744 --> 01:06:49.767
Mom.

01:06:50.311 --> 01:06:52.905
Okay, I admit I'm a little bit biased.

01:06:53.248 --> 01:06:56.705
But it is so true. You are talented.

01:06:57.117 --> 01:07:00.608
Your music speaks to people.
People wanna listen to you.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.154
And it is not just me and your dad.

01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:08.951
Girl 1: That's what I said.

01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:14.731
Girl 2: That was funny.
Girl 3: I know, I want to do that.

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:21.301
Hey, guys. Can I sit with you?

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:27.435
I guess.
But you have to give me your cake.

01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:29.707
Okay, deal.

01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:34.742
You know, sitting with the kitchen help
is really hurting my rep.

01:07:34.848 --> 01:07:36.075
What rep?

01:07:38.617 --> 01:07:41.380
Believe me, it's probably not that funny.

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.085
The chicken was kind of dry.

01:07:49.193 --> 01:07:52.684
Could you tell your mom to be
just a little more careful?

01:07:53.096 --> 01:07:54.324
Tess!

01:07:56.965 --> 01:08:00.924
Stop talking to me like that.
Stop talking to everyone like that.

01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:04.302
I may be the cook's daughter,
and my father may not be rich,

01:08:04.405 --> 01:08:07.464
but I'm a much better person than
someone who feels good about herself

01:08:07.574 --> 01:08:10.270
because she makes everyone
else feel bad.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.240
And I'll take that any day.

01:08:12.344 --> 01:08:15.472
If it wasn't obvious,
you're so out of the group.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.546
Then we'll make our own group.

01:08:23.252 --> 01:08:24.810
Camp rock
final jam - 5 days

01:08:39.566 --> 01:08:41.466
(inaudible)

01:09:13.426 --> 01:09:14.984
(Inaudible)

01:09:35.978 --> 01:09:37.444
Final jam
prep

01:09:39.182 --> 01:09:42.844
- I don't know why this is so fascinating.
- I don't think you're doing that right.

01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:46.317
- Wait. Look, I'm a pro.
- Don't get it in my macaroni.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.853
I'm sure they have it!

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:50.354
Okay, she has officially lost it.

01:09:50.457 --> 01:09:53.425
No, I didn't lose anything.
You guys stole it.

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:55.923
- What?
- What's going on here?

01:09:56.029 --> 01:10:00.431
Tess thinks that mitchie and caitlyn
stole her charm bracelet.

01:10:00.532 --> 01:10:01.498
Both: What?

01:10:01.599 --> 01:10:04.500
I'm sorry, brown, but these girls
would never do such a thing.

01:10:04.602 --> 01:10:07.092
Yeah. Look, let's just settle this, right?

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.171
But...

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.831
I know it was her. She was lying
all summer about who she is.

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.568
Who knows what else she'd lie about?

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:16.872
- Now, wait a minute.
- Mom, don't.

01:10:17.545 --> 01:10:19.445
If she wants to look, let her.
This is stupid.

01:10:19.547 --> 01:10:22.743
Okay, look, let me just scope this out,

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.842
and then I'll have a quick look
in your cabin. Right?

01:10:25.953 --> 01:10:27.510
- Fine.
- Whatever.

01:10:30.623 --> 01:10:33.750
You're not gonna find anything,
'cause I didn't...

01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:45.126
That's it. That is my charm bracelet.

01:10:45.235 --> 01:10:46.827
There's gotta be some mistake.

01:10:46.936 --> 01:10:48.960
Like what?
I snuck into the kitchen and...

01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:51.835
Tess, I got this. All right?

01:10:52.574 --> 01:10:54.803
I am totally wigged-out.

01:10:55.443 --> 01:10:57.035
Yeah. So are we.

01:10:57.144 --> 01:10:58.338
I'm not.

01:11:01.147 --> 01:11:03.547
Well, rules are rules,

01:11:04.316 --> 01:11:07.012
and since it's the end of camp,
I have no choice.

01:11:07.119 --> 01:11:10.679
I've gotta ban you guys
from the rest of camp activities,

01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:13.814
until the end of final jam.

01:11:13.925 --> 01:11:16.256
We didn't do anything. She's lying.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.351
- Do you have any proof?
- No, but...

01:11:18.462 --> 01:11:21.658
Well, then I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

01:11:25.634 --> 01:11:28.694
Until the end of final jam.

01:11:46.871 --> 01:11:49.669
Camper mates, and matettes,

01:11:49.774 --> 01:11:52.833
I am holding the lineup for final jam.

01:11:52.943 --> 01:11:55.706
I am gonna pin it up on the wall.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:59.805
Let me get out of the room before
you all come and have a look at it.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:01.815
All right! Goodness me.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.249
This is so not fair.

01:12:05.353 --> 01:12:06.512
I know.

01:12:08.522 --> 01:12:09.887
Guess who?

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.957
Dude, you're in the room.
I can see you.

01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:12.957
I can see you, too, man.

01:12:13.793 --> 01:12:15.226
I've missed you.

01:12:15.328 --> 01:12:16.589
Group hug.

01:12:17.663 --> 01:12:21.121
Much better. It hasn't been
the same just hugging Nate.

01:12:21.532 --> 01:12:23.295
Yeah, it hasn't been.

01:12:24.102 --> 01:12:25.592
So, good news.

01:12:25.703 --> 01:12:27.567
The press is here and they're gonna
cover the whole night.

01:12:27.671 --> 01:12:30.196
- The label loves it.
- That's awesome!

01:12:30.307 --> 01:12:33.833
Hey, man, where's this amazing singer
you've been looking for?

01:12:33.943 --> 01:12:35.672
What? I know things.

01:12:36.645 --> 01:12:38.703
Hoping to find her tonight.

01:12:43.684 --> 01:12:46.380
This was supposed to be a fun summer
that was all about music,

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:49.478
and all I did was get caught up
in Tess drama.

01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:51.554
It happens.

01:12:51.891 --> 01:12:54.620
I can't believe I agreed to be
some background singer

01:12:54.726 --> 01:12:56.694
just because I got intimidated.

01:12:56.795 --> 01:12:59.058
That's what Tess can do to you.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:02.131
No. I did it to me.

01:13:02.999 --> 01:13:05.797
I've never seen brown so harsh.

01:13:06.736 --> 01:13:08.464
I know. He just kept repeating.

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:10.970
(Mimicking brown)
"Until the end of final jam."

01:13:12.007 --> 01:13:14.099
I know. I was there.

01:13:18.678 --> 01:13:19.838
What?

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.808
What?

01:13:22.082 --> 01:13:24.174
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

01:13:25.017 --> 01:13:26.746
Camp rock theater.

01:13:32.624 --> 01:13:36.821
Okay. Who's stoked? Yeah!

01:13:36.927 --> 01:13:38.792
Final jam

01:13:38.896 --> 01:13:41.090
all right! All right!

01:13:42.832 --> 01:13:43.821
Bo y: Yeah!

01:13:43.933 --> 01:13:50.530
Okay, campers, friends, family,
camp rock fans, this is it.

01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:53.505
Tonight music history will be made

01:13:53.607 --> 01:13:58.669
as camp rock finds
a new final jam winner!

01:14:01.513 --> 01:14:03.708
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:06.248
(Singing) Come on,
come on, come on.

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:07.612
Look at me.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:12.955
This is not amateur night.
This is serious.

01:14:13.056 --> 01:14:14.045
We did it right!

01:14:14.157 --> 01:14:17.785
No! You didn't. You never do!
I'm trying to win here.

01:14:17.893 --> 01:14:20.293
You guys may be used to losing,
but not me.

01:14:20.396 --> 01:14:22.329
I'm tired of picking up the slack.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.728
Stop telling us what to do!

01:14:24.832 --> 01:14:26.093
You're the one
who's ruining everything.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.259
You're too intense all the time,

01:14:28.368 --> 01:14:32.235
and I am sick and tired
of picking up your slack, too!

01:14:32.338 --> 01:14:34.169
Peggy, come back here!

01:14:37.475 --> 01:14:40.069
Who needs her?
She was holding us back.

01:14:40.779 --> 01:14:42.973
Now you really better not mess up.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.448
You know what? Don't worry about me.
Do it yourself. I'm done.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:53.480
Btw, your lip gloss is
so not glossy anymore.

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.122
All right.

01:14:57.692 --> 01:15:03.493
This year, the final jam winner
will not only get a camp rock trophy

01:15:03.597 --> 01:15:05.531
and a big one, I might add,

01:15:05.632 --> 01:15:08.998
he or she is gonna get a sweet prize,

01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:14.834
a chance to record with my nephew,
pop star Shane gray!

01:15:14.939 --> 01:15:19.841
Yes! All right! Give it up! All right!

01:15:21.144 --> 01:15:23.771
To make sure
the right camper is chosen,

01:15:23.879 --> 01:15:27.906
we've invited the other members
of connect 3 to be judges.

01:15:28.017 --> 01:15:29.244
Yes!

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:31.945
Thank you so much.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.353
All right.

01:15:36.857 --> 01:15:40.189
Okay. Put your hands together
for barren James,

01:15:40.293 --> 01:15:44.285
sander lawyer, and
the hasta la vista crew.

01:15:49.101 --> 01:15:50.124
(Hasta la vista playing)

01:15:50.234 --> 01:15:52.532
(Rapping) Yeah, it's your boy Barry.

01:15:53.938 --> 01:15:57.532
And the place to be is crazy
come rock with me.

01:15:58.742 --> 01:16:01.005
Couldn't wait to leave
but now I hate to go.

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:03.374
Last day at camp
packing my bags slow.

01:16:03.479 --> 01:16:05.878
Made so many friends
why does it have to end.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.676
In the end it's a win
'cause we grown so close together.

01:16:08.783 --> 01:16:11.046
Remember when we first met, first day.

01:16:11.151 --> 01:16:12.448
Thinking this would be no fun.

01:16:12.552 --> 01:16:13.541
No way way.

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:14.746
Now it's time to leave leave.

01:16:14.855 --> 01:16:15.912
But now we wanna stay stay.

01:16:16.022 --> 01:16:18.354
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, oh.

01:16:18.457 --> 01:16:22.051
Hasta la vista
I'm-a gonna say goodbye to you.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.287
Whatever happens I'll be cool with you.

01:16:24.396 --> 01:16:26.226
Wanna give me your number?
I'm-a call you.

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:28.093
Promise I won't forget you.

01:16:28.198 --> 01:16:31.792
Hasta la vista
we'll all be going separate ways.

01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:33.732
Say everything you didn't say.

01:16:33.836 --> 01:16:35.360
This is your moment
before you go.

01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:37.233
Come on now
get up and show them.

01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:41.604
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
keep doing your thing, thing, thing.

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:46.509
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
keep doing your thing, thing, thing.

01:16:49.582 --> 01:16:50.810
Yeah.

01:16:52.084 --> 01:16:54.552
So hot get a clap to this.

01:16:57.288 --> 01:17:02.020
H-a-s-t-a
la vista.

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:06.960
H-a-s-t-a
la vista.

01:17:07.063 --> 01:17:10.521
Hasta la vista
I'm-a gonna say goodbye to you.

01:17:10.633 --> 01:17:12.964
Whatever happens I'll be cool with you
hey!

01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:14.763
Wanna give me your number?
I'm-a call you.

01:17:14.869 --> 01:17:16.598
Promise I won't forget you.

01:17:16.705 --> 01:17:20.299
Hasta la vista
we'll all be going separate ways.

01:17:20.407 --> 01:17:22.272
Say everything you didn't say.

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:23.865
This is your moment
before you go.

01:17:23.976 --> 01:17:26.342
Come on now
get up and show them.

01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:31.109
H-a-s-t-a
la vista.

01:17:31.216 --> 01:17:34.673
H-a-s-t-a

01:17:34.785 --> 01:17:36.650
hasta la vista

01:17:37.254 --> 01:17:38.554
(crowd cheering)

01:17:38.555 --> 01:17:39.249
(Crowd cheering)

01:17:54.935 --> 01:17:57.301
Oh, my goodness! Okay!

01:17:57.404 --> 01:18:03.740
Now, let's give it up for a group that
has the "it" factor, whatever "it" is.

01:18:04.476 --> 01:18:05.966
The it girls!

01:18:14.284 --> 01:18:15.272
Mom?

01:18:17.587 --> 01:18:18.918
(2 Stars playing)

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:26.923
(Singing) Wake up.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:30.891
When will things be good enough
for you to see.

01:18:30.997 --> 01:18:33.022
All that we can be

01:18:33.133 --> 01:18:35.293
I'm sick of.

01:18:35.401 --> 01:18:38.996
Playing games and acting like
we never care.

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:41.264
That we're never there.

01:18:41.372 --> 01:18:45.308
We pay attention
we pay attention.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.812
For only seconds.

01:18:49.913 --> 01:18:54.042
Look at you, look at me
there's never any us.

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:58.051
Can't you see all we can become.

01:18:58.153 --> 01:19:00.212
We can shine like the sun.

01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:05.622
If we believe that two stars
are brighter than one.

01:19:05.726 --> 01:19:09.627
Come on, come on, come on
look at you.

01:19:09.729 --> 01:19:12.356
Come on, come on, come on.

01:19:13.598 --> 01:19:18.330
Is it too much to ask
that you put us first?

01:19:19.136 --> 01:19:20.296
Oh

01:19:21.672 --> 01:19:26.267
I feel like we're last in our universe.

01:19:27.143 --> 01:19:31.101
And that's not where we ought to be.

01:19:32.214 --> 01:19:34.374
Look at you, look at me.

01:19:34.482 --> 01:19:36.109
There's never any us.

01:19:36.217 --> 01:19:40.050
Can't you see all we can become.

01:19:40.153 --> 01:19:42.348
We can shine like the sun.

01:19:42.456 --> 01:19:45.652
If we believe that two stars
are brighter than one

01:19:45.758 --> 01:19:47.419
(cell phone ringing)

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.661
Come on, come on, come on
look at you.

01:19:51.763 --> 01:19:55.630
Come on, come on, come on
look at me.

01:19:55.732 --> 01:19:59.792
Come on, come on, come on
look at you.

01:19:59.902 --> 01:20:01.767
Come on, come on, come on

01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:02.929
(all gasping)

01:20:06.575 --> 01:20:09.509
(Crowd murmuring)

01:20:30.794 --> 01:20:34.127
Well, it looks like we are
basically finished the...

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:41.458
Put it on pause.
We have a last-minute addition.

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.432
Come on up, Margaret dupree!

01:20:48.575 --> 01:20:50.042
Who's Margaret?

01:20:51.544 --> 01:20:52.568
I am.

01:20:53.212 --> 01:20:54.804
Go, Margaret!

01:20:56.147 --> 01:20:57.774
(Playing here I am)

01:21:01.719 --> 01:21:05.177
(Singing)
They tell you a good girl is quiet and.

01:21:05.289 --> 01:21:08.780
That you should never ask why.

01:21:08.892 --> 01:21:14.420
'Cause it only makes it harder to fit in.

01:21:15.197 --> 01:21:18.632
And you should be happy, excited.

01:21:18.733 --> 01:21:22.259
Even if you're just invited.

01:21:22.369 --> 01:21:26.998
'Cause the winners need someone
to clap for them.

01:21:29.642 --> 01:21:32.269
It's so hard just waiting.

01:21:32.377 --> 01:21:35.904
In a line that never moves.

01:21:36.014 --> 01:21:39.574
It's time you started making.

01:21:39.683 --> 01:21:41.548
Your own rules.

01:21:42.351 --> 01:21:45.946
You gotta scream
until there's nothing left.

01:21:46.055 --> 01:21:51.185
With your last breath
say here I am.

01:21:51.293 --> 01:21:54.227
Here I am.

01:21:54.328 --> 01:21:56.023
Make them listen.

01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:59.394
'Cause there's no way
you'll be ignored.

01:21:59.499 --> 01:22:00.989
Not anymore.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.591
Say here I am.

01:22:04.703 --> 01:22:07.968
Here I am.

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:11.231
Here I am.

01:22:12.677 --> 01:22:15.736
The world better make some room.

01:22:15.845 --> 01:22:19.871
Yeah, move over, over.

01:22:19.982 --> 01:22:23.281
'Cause you're coming through.

01:22:23.385 --> 01:22:25.944
'Cause you're coming through.

01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:29.386
You gotta scream
until there's nothing left.

01:22:29.489 --> 01:22:31.684
With your last breath.

01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:34.851
Here I am.

01:22:34.961 --> 01:22:37.930
Here I am.

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:39.792
Make them listen.

01:22:39.898 --> 01:22:43.095
'Cause there's no way
you'll be ignored.

01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:44.861
Not anymore.

01:22:44.969 --> 01:22:48.302
Say here I am.

01:22:48.405 --> 01:22:51.339
Here I am.

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:55.207
Here I am.

01:22:59.081 --> 01:23:01.844
Here I am.

01:23:06.286 --> 01:23:08.914
Here I am

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:31.936
Peggy?

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.567
What?

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.140
You were really good.

01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:39.879
I didn't know you were that good,

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.415
and when someone's that good,
someone should tell them.

01:23:44.083 --> 01:23:45.277
Thanks.

01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:47.651
And I'm sorry.

01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:03.458
Wow! She was amazing.
I know, I know.

01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:06.534
All right, all right, all right. Settle down.

01:24:07.269 --> 01:24:09.133
Settle down, sunshine!

01:24:10.071 --> 01:24:15.064
I guess that's it.
It's officially the end of final jam,

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:19.873
and time for our judges to go off
in private, and, well, judge.

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.349
So, we'll check you in a minute.

01:24:31.455 --> 01:24:33.218
(Feedback on PA)

01:24:35.124 --> 01:24:37.285
Excuse me. Just a minute.

01:24:37.694 --> 01:24:39.684
It's the end of final jam.

01:24:43.865 --> 01:24:46.162
I was so hoping you'd catch on.

01:24:46.267 --> 01:24:49.929
Now get out there, steal their hearts,
and rock it, poppet.

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:55.371
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:02.575
(Who will I be playing)

01:25:04.981 --> 01:25:07.814
(Singing)
I've always been the kind of girl.

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:10.283
That hid my face.

01:25:10.386 --> 01:25:13.287
So afraid to tell the world.

01:25:13.389 --> 01:25:15.652
What I've got to say.

01:25:15.757 --> 01:25:18.419
But I have this dream.

01:25:18.526 --> 01:25:20.755
Bright inside of me

01:25:20.861 --> 01:25:22.988
I'm gonna let it show.

01:25:23.097 --> 01:25:27.829
It's time to let you know.

01:25:27.934 --> 01:25:30.459
To let you know.

01:25:31.036 --> 01:25:33.800
This is real, this is me

01:25:33.905 --> 01:25:37.431
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be now.

01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:41.567
Gonna let the light shine on me.

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:44.340
Now I've found who I am.

01:25:44.447 --> 01:25:47.643
There's no way to hold it in.

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:51.583
No more hiding who I wanna be.

01:25:52.186 --> 01:25:54.586
This is me.

01:25:54.689 --> 01:25:56.247
That's the song!

01:25:57.124 --> 01:25:58.113
So that must be the girl.

01:25:58.225 --> 01:25:59.192
Do you know what it's like.

01:25:59.292 --> 01:26:00.725
You think?

01:26:00.827 --> 01:26:03.192
To feel so in the dark.

01:26:03.295 --> 01:26:05.923
To dream about a life.

01:26:06.031 --> 01:26:08.294
Where you're the shining star.

01:26:08.399 --> 01:26:10.959
Even though it seems.

01:26:11.069 --> 01:26:13.764
Like it's too far away

01:26:13.871 --> 01:26:17.636
I have to believe in myself.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.267
It's the only way.

01:26:21.377 --> 01:26:23.867
This is real, this is me

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:27.574
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be now.

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:31.811
Gonna let the light shine on me.

01:26:31.919 --> 01:26:34.478
Now I've found who I am.

01:26:34.587 --> 01:26:37.647
There's no way to hold it in.

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:42.250
No more hiding who I wanna be.

01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:45.625
This is me.

01:26:47.698 --> 01:26:50.757
You're the voice I hear inside my head.

01:26:50.867 --> 01:26:52.858
The reason that I'm singing

01:26:52.969 --> 01:26:55.266
I need to find you

01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:58.033
I gotta find you.

01:26:58.841 --> 01:27:01.240
You're the missing piece I need.

01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:03.367
The song inside of me.

01:27:03.478 --> 01:27:05.843
- I need to find you.
- I need to find you.

01:27:05.946 --> 01:27:08.574
- I gotta find you.
- I gotta find you.

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:11.445
This is real, this is me

01:27:11.551 --> 01:27:15.111
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be now.

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:19.316
Gonna let the light shine on me.

01:27:19.424 --> 01:27:21.983
Now I've found who I am.

01:27:22.092 --> 01:27:25.117
There's no way to hold it in.

01:27:25.228 --> 01:27:29.858
No more hiding who I wanna be
yeah.

01:27:29.966 --> 01:27:32.866
- This is me.
- You're the missing piece I need.

01:27:32.968 --> 01:27:34.833
The song inside of me.

01:27:34.937 --> 01:27:36.096
This is me, yeah.

01:27:36.204 --> 01:27:38.331
You're the voice I hear inside my head.

01:27:38.439 --> 01:27:40.304
The reason that I'm singing.

01:27:40.408 --> 01:27:43.001
Now I've found who I am.

01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:46.305
There's no way to hold it in.

01:27:46.412 --> 01:27:50.610
No more hiding who I wanna be.

01:27:50.982 --> 01:27:54.349
- This is me.
- This is me.

01:28:06.895 --> 01:28:08.556
Yeah!

01:28:20.006 --> 01:28:22.906
Okay, gang, this is it.

01:28:23.308 --> 01:28:28.210
The winner of final jam this year is...
Drum roll, please.

01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:30.580
(Drum roll)

01:28:31.482 --> 01:28:34.541
Margaret dupree! Yes!

01:28:35.652 --> 01:28:37.415

You gotta go! You gotta go!

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.062
Way to go, Margaret!

01:28:56.168 --> 01:29:00.126
You just got yourself a chance
to record with Shane gray! Yes!

01:29:03.275 --> 01:29:06.801
Congratulations, Peggy.
You deserve it. You were amazing.

01:29:12.782 --> 01:29:15.409
You did it! I mean, I did it. We did...

01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.978
You guys were really great.

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.409
Thanks.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:21.579
Yeah.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:25.522
So, I told brown you guys
didn't take my bracelet.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.318
Wow.

01:29:30.729 --> 01:29:31.889
Thank you.

01:29:31.997 --> 01:29:33.726
See you next summer.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.390
Mitchie: Sure.

01:29:49.178 --> 01:29:51.771
Mitchie. You were fabulous.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.348
Honey, I'm sorry you didn't win.

01:29:54.449 --> 01:29:58.782
But I did. I won the best summer
of my life. Thanks to you.

01:30:03.256 --> 01:30:04.587
I love you.

01:30:05.725 --> 01:30:08.215
- We'll see you in a few, okay?
- Okay.

01:30:11.228 --> 01:30:13.389
So I guess my search is over.

01:30:13.798 --> 01:30:16.425
That depends on
who you're looking for.

01:30:16.533 --> 01:30:18.023
Hi, I'm mitchie.

01:30:18.134 --> 01:30:19.431
I'm Shane.

01:30:20.503 --> 01:30:22.299
You up for a canoe ride later?

01:30:22.404 --> 01:30:24.099
I wouldn't miss it.

01:30:29.777 --> 01:30:34.440
All right! Okay, camp rockers!

01:30:34.548 --> 01:30:38.108
Final jam is over,
and you know what that means?

01:30:38.217 --> 01:30:42.983
My favorite part of the summer,
the final jam jam session!

01:30:43.822 --> 01:30:45.289
Let's kick it!

01:30:45.423 --> 01:30:46.117
(Whoops)

01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:50.726
(We rock playing)

01:30:54.831 --> 01:30:57.391
(Singing) 'Cause we rock
we rock.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.091
We rock on.

01:30:59.801 --> 01:31:02.429
Oh, we rock, we rock on.

01:31:02.537 --> 01:31:05.733
Come as you are
you're a superstar.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.070
World's in your pocket and you know it.

01:31:09.175 --> 01:31:12.406
You can feel that beat
running through your feet.

01:31:12.512 --> 01:31:15.344
Heart's racing fast
you're rock and rolling.

01:31:15.447 --> 01:31:19.906
All that you need is the music.

01:31:20.018 --> 01:31:24.681
To take you to some other place.

01:31:24.788 --> 01:31:30.282
Where you know you belong.

01:31:30.393 --> 01:31:33.453
Raise your hands up
in the air and scream.

01:31:33.562 --> 01:31:36.394
We're finding our voice
following our dreams.

01:31:36.498 --> 01:31:40.194
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.360
Nobody in the world's
gonna bring us down.

01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:46.404
The louder we go
well, the better we sound.

01:31:46.506 --> 01:31:50.464
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:54.936
- We got the music in our souls.
- The music in our souls.

01:31:55.046 --> 01:31:58.209
- And it's the thing we want the most.
- What we want the most.

01:31:58.315 --> 01:32:00.805
It picks us up when we fall down.

01:32:00.917 --> 01:32:04.080
It turns our world around.

01:32:04.187 --> 01:32:06.848
We rock, we rock, we rock.

01:32:06.955 --> 01:32:09.719
Every day and every night.

01:32:09.825 --> 01:32:13.316
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:17.090
It's all we wanna do in life.

01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:20.189
Raise your hands up in the air
and scream.

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.063
We're finding our voice
following our dreams.

01:32:23.169 --> 01:32:26.865
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:32:26.971 --> 01:32:30.202
Nobody in the world's
gonna bring us down.

01:32:30.308 --> 01:32:33.140
The louder we go
well, the better we sound.

01:32:33.243 --> 01:32:37.042
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:32:37.146 --> 01:32:40.206
Raise your hands up in the air
and scream.

01:32:40.316 --> 01:32:43.113
We're finding our voice
following our dreams.

01:32:43.218 --> 01:32:46.880
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:32:46.987 --> 01:32:50.184
Nobody in the world's
gonna bring us down.

01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:53.316
The louder we go
well, the better we sound.

01:32:53.426 --> 01:32:57.521
'Cause we rock, we rock
we rock, we rock on.

01:32:57.629 --> 01:33:00.860
We rock, we rock, we rock on.

01:33:00.966 --> 01:33:03.559
We rock, we rock camp rock.

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:23.910
Three months later.

01:33:32.592 --> 01:33:34.183
- Whoa.
- Wow.

01:33:34.292 --> 01:33:35.418
Whoa.

01:33:37.162 --> 01:33:39.823
- It's incredible.
- Awesome.

01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:42.228
- Wow.
- So cool.

01:33:42.333 --> 01:33:46.393
Caitlyn, we know you said you built
a little recording studio...

01:33:46.503 --> 01:33:49.960
But this is the coolest thing I've seen
since my mom's tour bus.

01:33:50.072 --> 01:33:52.040
Oh. Phenomenal!

01:33:52.141 --> 01:33:53.802
Extraordinary.

01:33:53.909 --> 01:33:55.102
Totally!

01:33:58.613 --> 01:33:59.601
Way cool.

01:33:59.713 --> 01:34:02.011
Way, way cool.

01:34:02.115 --> 01:34:04.083
We still keep all our old stuff in here.

01:34:04.184 --> 01:34:08.017
We got the skis and the bikes.
My dad's tools.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.383
Okay, guys. I can't wait to get started.

01:34:10.488 --> 01:34:12.285
- I know. Me, too.
- Oh, my God. We're gonna...

01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:15.324
Okay, everybody, grab some Mikes
and set them up.

01:34:15.425 --> 01:34:16.756
I'm excited.

01:34:17.661 --> 01:34:21.824
Okay, let me just adjust some things.
All right, get your headphones.

01:34:23.032 --> 01:34:25.159
- Got them? Are we ready?
- Yeah.

01:34:25.268 --> 01:34:26.256
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:34:26.368 --> 01:34:27.801
And go.

01:34:28.336 --> 01:34:30.600
(Our time is here playing)

01:34:41.813 --> 01:34:45.408
(Singing) We're done, but it's not over.

01:34:45.517 --> 01:34:47.609
We'll start it again.

01:34:47.718 --> 01:34:50.050
After the end of the day.

01:34:50.154 --> 01:34:52.678
It keeps getting better.

01:34:52.789 --> 01:34:54.484
Don't be afraid.

01:34:54.591 --> 01:34:56.422

Gone are the days of summer.

01:35:15.241 --> 01:35:18.403

How can we see what's ahead?

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.570

01:35:57.675 --> 01:36:01.701
And all we can do
ls travel each day to the next.

All that you need is the music.

01:37:56.471 --> 01:38:00.930
To take you to some other place.

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:06.910
Where you know you belong.

01:38:07.013 --> 01:38:10.072
Raise your hands up in the air
and scream.

01:38:10.182 --> 01:38:13.015
