00:47.589 --> 00:51.384
<i>Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:54.720
<i>Where the caravan camels roam</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:58.641
<i>Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense</i>

00:58.642 --> 01:02.228
<i>It's barbaric, but hey, it's home</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:05.815
<i>When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west</i>

01:05.816 --> 01:09.026
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:13.573
<i>Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly</i>

01:13.574 --> 01:17.827
<i>To another Arabian night</i>

01:17.828 --> 01:21.664
<i>Arabian nights</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:25.376
<i>Like Arabian days</i>

01:25.377 --> 01:29.255
<i>More often than not
Are hotter than hot</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:32.967
<i>In a lot of good ways</i>

01:32.968 --> 01:36.470
<i>Arabian nights</i>

01:36.471 --> 01:40.308
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>

01:40.309 --> 01:44.437
<i>A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard</i>

01:44.438 --> 01:49.444
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>

01:51.653 --> 01:56.532
Ah, salaam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.910
Please, please, come closer.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.412
Too close. A little too close.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.122
There.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.541
Welcome to Agrabah,

02:05.542 --> 02:09.836
city of mystery, of enchantment,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.964
and the finest merchandise
this side of the River Jordan,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.008
on sale today. Come on down.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.760
Look at this. Yes.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.731
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.099
Will not break. Will not...

02:22.100 --> 02:23.684
It broke.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.437
Ohh! Look at this.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.398
I have never seen one
of these intact before.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.400
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.155
Listen. Ah, still good.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.656
Wait. Don't go.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.660
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

02:40.661 --> 02:45.257
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.834
Do not be fooled by its
commonplace appearance.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.587
Like so many things, it
is not what is outside,

02:51.588 --> 02:54.423
but what is inside that counts.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.300
This is no ordinary lamp.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.220
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

02:59.221 --> 03:03.516
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.227
A diamond in the rough.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.479
Perhaps you would like
to hear the tale?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.484
It begins on a dark night,

03:13.527 --> 03:16.737
<i>where a dark man waits</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:20.458
<i>with a dark purpose.</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:27.289
You are late.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.209
A thousand apologies,
O patient one.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.460
You have it, then?

03:31.461 --> 03:35.214
I had to slit a few
throats, but I got it.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.216
Ah-ah-ahhh.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.884
The treasure.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.432
Ow!

03:41.638 --> 03:45.641
Trust me, my pungent friend.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.692
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!

03:56.570 --> 04:00.165
Quickly! Follow the trail.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.999
Faster.

04:24.890 --> 04:29.435
At last, after all my
years of searching,

04:29.436 --> 04:31.854
the Cave of Wonders.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.023
Awk. Cave of Wonders.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.776
By Allah.

04:36.777 --> 04:41.030
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

04:41.031 --> 04:45.581
The rest of the treasure is
yours, but the lamp is mine.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.582
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.585
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

04:54.586 --> 04:57.180
Shh.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.776
Who disturbs my slumber?

05:14.397 --> 05:19.026
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
Know this.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.989
Only one may enter here,

05:23.990 --> 05:27.409
one whose worth lies far within.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.914
A diamond in the rough.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.083
What are you waiting for? Go on.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.769
No!

05:53.770 --> 06:00.403
Seek thee out the
diamond in the rough.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.950
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

06:07.951 --> 06:12.329
We're never gonna get a
hold of that stupid lamp.

06:12.330 --> 06:17.336
Just forget it. Look at this. I'm
so ticked off that I'm moulting.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.338
Patience, Iago. Patience.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.092
Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.344
Oh, there's a big surprise.

06:27.345 --> 06:32.099
I think I'm gonna have a heart
attack and die from that surprise.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.645
What are we gonna do? We got
a big problem here, a big...

06:36.646 --> 06:38.981
Yes.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.151
Only one may enter.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.528
I must find this one, this...

06:44.529 --> 06:47.657
Diamond in the rough.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.576
Stop! Thief!

06:50.577 --> 06:54.251
I'll have your hands for
a trophy, street rat.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.874
All this for a loaf of bread?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.843
Whoa!

07:08.345 --> 07:11.847
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.891
You think that was easy?

07:15.477 --> 07:18.187
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.522
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.485
Getting into trouble a little
early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

07:24.486 --> 07:27.863
Trouble? No way. You're only
in trouble if you get caught.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.615
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.075
And this time...

07:32.953 --> 07:34.870
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.706
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.501
<i>Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line</i>

07:40.502 --> 07:42.419
<i>One swing ahead of the sword</i>

07:42.420 --> 07:44.964
<i>I steal only what I can't afford</i>

07:44.965 --> 07:46.382
<i>That's everything</i>

07:46.383 --> 07:48.384
<i>One jump ahead of the lawmen</i>

07:48.385 --> 07:50.344
<i>That's all, and that's no joke</i>

07:50.345 --> 07:53.724
<i>These guys don't
appreciate I'm broke</i>

07:53.807 --> 07:55.891
<i>- Riffraff
Street rat</i>

07:55.892 --> 07:57.851
<i>Scoundrel
Take that</i>

07:57.852 --> 08:01.897
<i>Just a little snack, guys</i>

08:01.898 --> 08:05.901
<i>Rip him open
Take it back, guys</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:07.736
<i>I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.905
<i>- You're my only friend, Abu
Who?</i>

08:09.906 --> 08:13.742
<i>Oh, it's sad Aladdin's
hit the bottom</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:17.579
<i>He's become a one-man rise in crime</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:21.458
<i>I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em</i>

08:21.459 --> 08:23.252
<i>Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:25.587
<i>Tell you all about it
When I got the time</i>

08:25.588 --> 08:29.425
<i>One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:31.802
<i>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</i>

08:31.803 --> 08:33.429
<i>There he is</i>

08:33.429 --> 08:37.390
<i>One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock</i>

08:37.392 --> 08:40.770
<i>I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block</i>

08:40.937 --> 08:43.022
<i>- Stop, thief
- Vandal</i>

08:43.023 --> 08:44.857
<i>- Abu
- Scandal</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:49.153
<i>Let's not be too hasty</i>

08:49.154 --> 08:53.115
<i>Still I think he's rather tasty</i>

08:53.116 --> 08:55.075
<i>Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:56.577
<i>Otherwise we'd get along</i>

08:56.578 --> 08:58.625
Wrong

08:59.205 --> 09:00.957
Get him!

09:07.172 --> 09:09.470
He's got a sword!

09:09.549 --> 09:13.394
You idiots. We've all got swords.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.019
<i>- One jump ahead of the hoof beats
- Vandal!</i>

09:22.020 --> 09:23.854
<i>- One hop ahead of the hump
- Street rat!</i>

09:23.855 --> 09:25.814
<i>- One trick ahead of disaster
- Scoundrel!</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:27.733
<i>They're quick, but I'm much faster</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:29.359
<i>Here goes, better throw my hand in</i>

09:29.360 --> 09:33.330
<i>Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump</i>

09:39.496 --> 09:41.998
Yuck! Oy!

09:46.586 --> 09:50.172
And now, esteemed effendi,
we feast. All right.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.175
Yum, yum!

10:00.517 --> 10:02.269
Uh-oh.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.660
Here. Go on. Take it.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.894
Ah, don't. Huh?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.102
On his way to the
palace, I suppose.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.313
Another suitor for the princess.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.069
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.237
Hey!

10:55.238 --> 10:58.240
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

10:58.241 --> 11:02.077
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.791
Look at that, Abu.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.044
It's not every day you see a
horse with two rear ends.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.588
Ooh!

11:12.589 --> 11:15.215
You are a worthless street rat.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.844
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

11:18.845 --> 11:22.394
and only your fleas will mourn you.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.060
I'm not worthless.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.689
And I don't have fleas.

11:31.733 --> 11:35.658
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.287
<i>Riffraff, street rat</i>

11:45.288 --> 11:47.998
<i>I don't buy that</i>

11:47.999 --> 11:52.544
<i>If only they'd look closer</i>

11:52.545 --> 11:55.756
<i>Would they see a poor boy?</i>

11:55.757 --> 11:57.850
<i>No, siree</i>

11:59.886 --> 12:03.138
<i>They'd find out</i>

12:03.139 --> 12:07.142
<i>There's so much more</i>

12:07.143 --> 12:13.366
<i>To me</i>

12:14.817 --> 12:19.279
Someday, Abu, things
are gonna change.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.241
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.915
and never have any problems at all.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.083
I've never been so insulted.

12:31.084 --> 12:35.212
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not
leaving so soon, are you?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.589
Good luck marrying her off.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.513
Oh! Jasmine.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.516
Jasmine!

12:45.890 --> 12:47.891
Jasmine!

12:47.892 --> 12:50.394
Confound it, Rajah.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.191
So, this is why Prince
Achmed stormed out.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.859
Oh, Father.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.696
Rajah was just playing with
him. Weren't you, Rajah?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.948
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

13:02.949 --> 13:05.742
self-absorbed Prince
Achmed, weren't you?

13:09.872 --> 13:14.376
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

13:14.377 --> 13:18.046
The law says you must
be married to a prince

13:18.047 --> 13:20.215
by your next birthday.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.758
The law is wrong.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.219
You've only got three more days.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.848
Father, I hate being
forced into this.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.393
If I do marry, I want
it to be for love.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.111
Jasmine,

13:33.354 --> 13:36.903
it's not only this law.

13:38.234 --> 13:42.739
I'm not going to be around
forever, and, well, I...

13:43.281 --> 13:47.326
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.827
Provided for.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.079
Please try to understand.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.751
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.966
Except you, Rajah.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.966
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.719
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.597
Then maybe I don't want to
be a princess any more.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.558
Oooh! I... I...

14:11.559 --> 14:14.895
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.773
Hmm?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.952
I don't know where
she gets it from.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.373
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.718
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.545
My most trusted advisor.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.423
I am in desperate
need of your wisdom.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.468
My life is but to
serve you, my lord.

14:46.469 --> 14:50.806
It's this suitor business. Jasmine
refuses to choose a husband.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.267
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

14:54.268 --> 14:56.478
Oh!

14:56.479 --> 15:00.315
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.985
Your Majesty certainly has
a way with dumb animals.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.699
Now, then, perhaps I
can divine a solution

15:09.700 --> 15:11.743
to this thorny problem.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.578
If anyone can help, it's you.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.500
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.711
Oh. Uh, my ring?

15:21.712 --> 15:24.089
But it's been in the
family for years.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.509
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.603
Don't worry.

15:29.679 --> 15:35.725
Everything will be fine.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.936
The diamond.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.355
Here, Jafar.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.025
Whatever you need will be fine.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.654
You are most gracious, my liege.

15:46.821 --> 15:50.532
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

15:50.533 --> 15:54.879
Yes. That will be pretty good.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.416
I can't take it any more!

15:59.417 --> 16:05.549
If I gotta choke down on one more of
those mouldy, disgusting crackers...

16:05.965 --> 16:07.799
Bam! Whack!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.551
Calm yourself, Iago.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.052
Then I'd grab him around
the head. Whack!

16:11.053 --> 16:15.432
Soon I will be sultan, not
that addlepated twit.

16:15.433 --> 16:21.064
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat. Ha, ha!

16:38.748 --> 16:41.583
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

16:41.584 --> 16:45.884
But I can't stay here and
have my life lived for me.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.758
I'll miss you.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.065
Good bye.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.198
Okay, Abu. Go.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.285
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

17:19.454 --> 17:22.082
Get your paws off that.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.458
Why, you...

17:23.459 --> 17:27.589
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

17:28.631 --> 17:30.633
Good bye.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.556
Nice going, Abu.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.646
Breakfast is served.

17:39.976 --> 17:44.062
Pretty lady, buy a pot. No
finer pot in brass or silver.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.606
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.984
Sugar dates and pistachios.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.819
Would the lady like a necklace?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.154
A pretty necklace
for a pretty lady.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.739
Fresh fish!

17:54.740 --> 17:56.157
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

17:56.158 --> 17:58.331
Oh, no. I don't think so.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.120
Oh!

18:00.121 --> 18:02.497
Excuse me.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.179
I'm really very sorry.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.091
Wow.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.893
Uh-oh.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.517
Hello? Hello?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.855
Oh, you must be hungry.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.106
Here you go.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.611
You'd better be able
to pay for that.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.821
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.782
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.534
- Thief!
- Please...

18:39.535 --> 18:42.370
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.498
Do you know what the
penalty is for stealing?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.500
No! No, please!

18:47.501 --> 18:51.212
Thank you, kind sir. I'm
so glad you found her.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.714
I've been looking all over for you.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.299
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.926
You, uh, know this girl?

18:56.927 --> 18:59.971
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.514
She's a little crazy.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.351
She said she knew the sultan.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.071
She thinks the monkey
is the sultan.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.776
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.365
Tragic, isn't it?

19:18.366 --> 19:20.659
But no harm done.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.370
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.747
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

19:25.748 --> 19:29.501
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.798
Huh? What?

19:34.799 --> 19:37.597
Come back here, you little thieves!

19:41.597 --> 19:44.599
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.936
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

19:47.937 --> 19:50.735
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.900
Yes, O mighty evil one.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.656
Part, sands of time.

19:59.657 --> 20:03.660
Reveal to me the one who
can enter the cave.

20:03.661 --> 20:07.290
Yes! Yes!

20:07.331 --> 20:09.791
There he is.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.168
My diamond in the rough.

20:12.169 --> 20:16.094
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

20:16.590 --> 20:22.642
Let's have the guards extend him an
invitation to the palace, shall we?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.472
Swell.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.112
Almost there.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.494
I want to thank you for
stopping that man.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.833
Uh, forget it.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.129
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

20:50.374 --> 20:52.251
Is it that obvious?

20:52.460 --> 20:55.338
Well, you do kind of stand out.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.847
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.179
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.102
Wow.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.142
Hey.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.192
Come on. This way.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.064
Whoa. Watch your head there.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.608
Be careful.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.693
Is this where you live?

21:18.694 --> 21:22.197
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.032
That sounds fabulous.

21:24.033 --> 21:28.663
Well, it's not much, but
it's got a great view.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.123
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

21:32.124 --> 21:35.210
Oh, it's wonderful.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.587
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

21:37.588 --> 21:40.340
and have servants and valets.

21:40.341 --> 21:44.141
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.429
It's better than here.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.057
You're always scraping for
food and ducking the guards.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.392
You're not free to
make your own choices.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.853
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

21:53.854 --> 21:55.981
- Trapped.
- Trapped.

21:59.610 --> 22:03.455
So, where are you from?

22:03.906 --> 22:05.365
What does it matter?

22:05.366 --> 22:08.415
I ran away and I am not going back.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.585
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

22:13.916 --> 22:16.919
My father's forcing
me to get married.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.259
That's... That's awful.

22:20.798 --> 22:24.342
Abu!

22:24.343 --> 22:26.265
What?

22:26.637 --> 22:30.098
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.266
What?

22:31.267 --> 22:34.102
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

22:34.103 --> 22:38.231
And does Abu have
anything else to say?

22:38.232 --> 22:41.442
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.490
Oh, boy.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.326
Hmm.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.958
Tell him that's very sweet.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.620
Here you are.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.873
- They're after me!
- They're after you?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.291
My father must have sent them...

22:56.292 --> 22:57.542
- Do you trust me?
- What?

22:57.543 --> 23:00.211
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

23:00.212 --> 23:02.134
Then jump!

23:07.136 --> 23:12.016
We just keep running into each
other, don't we, street rat?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.059
Run! Go! Get out of here!

23:15.060 --> 23:17.358
Get this thing off of me!

23:17.605 --> 23:20.815
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.983
Let him go.

23:21.984 --> 23:26.446
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

23:26.447 --> 23:30.793
Unhand him, by order
of the princess.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.494
Princess Jasmine.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.204
- The princess?
- Princess?

23:35.205 --> 23:38.499
What are you doing outside the
palace? And with this street rat.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.629
That's not your concern. Do as
I command. Release him.

23:42.630 --> 23:46.466
I would, Princess, except
my orders come from Jafar.

23:46.467 --> 23:50.688
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.478
Jafar?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.480
Oh, Princess.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.982
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.276
How may I be of service to you?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.826
The guards just took a boy from
the market, on your orders.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.700
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.662
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

24:15.663 --> 24:16.996
I can't breathe, Jafar.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.667
Why, kidnapping the
princess, of course.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.002
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

24:23.003 --> 24:25.672
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.267
Oh, dear.

24:29.051 --> 24:33.181
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

24:33.472 --> 24:34.681
What do you mean?

24:34.682 --> 24:38.393
Sadly, the boy's sentence has
already been carried out.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.061
What sentence?

24:40.062 --> 24:41.688
Death.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.817
- By beheading.
- No.

24:47.277 --> 24:51.155
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.408
How could you?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.503
So, how did it go?

25:05.504 --> 25:09.634
I think she took it rather well.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.736
It's all my fault, Rajah.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.117
I didn't even know his name.

25:49.465 --> 25:53.560
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.471
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.

25:56.472 --> 26:00.602
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!

26:01.226 --> 26:03.394
Abu. Down here.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.148
Come on, help me out of these.

26:14.364 --> 26:18.326
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.786
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.538
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.667
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.174
She's gotta marry a prince.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.678
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

26:32.091 --> 26:34.634
I'm a fool.

26:34.635 --> 26:38.685
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.389
Who are you?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.267
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.863
But together, perhaps
we can be more.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.356
I'm listening.

26:48.357 --> 26:52.735
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

26:52.736 --> 26:57.073
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.366
Ooh!

26:58.367 --> 27:02.954
Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.706
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.334
But the law says
only a prince can...

27:08.335 --> 27:11.170
You've heard of the
golden rule, haven't you?

27:11.171 --> 27:13.840
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.219
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

27:18.220 --> 27:23.057
I need a young pair of legs and a
strong back to go in after it.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.892
Uh, one problem.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.103
It's out there. We're in here.

27:27.104 --> 27:32.701
Uh-uh. Things aren't
always what they seem.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.412
So, do we have a deal?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.490
Oh, I don't know.

27:50.752 --> 27:55.007
Who disturbs my slumber?

27:55.924 --> 27:59.553
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.222
Proceed.

28:03.223 --> 28:07.068
Touch nothing but the lamp.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.563
Remember, boy, first
fetch me the lamp,

28:10.564 --> 28:14.525
and then you shall
have your reward.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.778
Come on, Abu.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.553
Would you look at that!

28:35.839 --> 28:40.060
Just a handful of this stuff would
make me richer than the sultan.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.220
Abu!

28:43.388 --> 28:46.140
Don't touch anything.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.850
We gotta find that lamp.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.333
Huh?

29:18.840 --> 29:22.514
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

29:45.701 --> 29:48.499
Abu, what are you, crazy?

29:50.831 --> 29:53.629
A magic carpet.

29:53.709 --> 29:57.463
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.974
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.183
Thanks.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.610
Wait a minute. Don't go.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.034
Maybe you can help us.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.038
Hey! Whoa!

30:28.410 --> 30:30.753
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.918
I think he knows where it is.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.896
Wait here.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.576
Oh!

31:27.135 --> 31:28.803
This is it?

31:28.804 --> 31:31.807
This is what we came all
the way down here to...

31:31.932 --> 31:34.475
Abu! No!

31:34.476 --> 31:37.561
- Infidels!
- Uh-oh.

31:37.562 --> 31:42.943
You have touched the
forbidden treasure!

31:43.985 --> 31:49.662
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

31:50.492 --> 31:52.164
Whoa!

32:16.017 --> 32:19.441
Help! Help! Help!

32:20.856 --> 32:22.903
Gotcha!

32:26.027 --> 32:28.200
Carpet, let's move.

32:43.253 --> 32:44.879
Abu!

32:44.880 --> 32:47.724
Abu, this is no time to panic.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.142
Start panicking.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.554
Whoa!

33:20.999 --> 33:23.167
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.753
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.131
First give me the lamp.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.638
Yes!

33:35.639 --> 33:38.015
At last!

33:41.603 --> 33:42.770
What are you doing?

33:42.771 --> 33:45.439
Giving you your reward.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.945
Your eternal reward.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.972
It's mine.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.315
It's all mine.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.143
I... Where is it?

34:23.143 --> 34:24.770
No.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.774
No!

34:32.529 --> 34:34.155
Jasmine?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.326
Oh, dearest.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.202
What's wrong?

34:41.621 --> 34:44.290
Jafar has

34:44.291 --> 34:46.917
done something terrible.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.712
There, there, my dear.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.922
We'll set it right.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.051
Now, tell me everything.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.017
Oh.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.682
Aladdin. Wake up.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.480
Aladdin.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.859
Oh! My head.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.941
We're trapped.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.194
That two-faced son of a jackal!

35:15.405 --> 35:19.825
Whoever he was, he's long
gone with that lamp.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.243
Aha!

35:21.244 --> 35:25.089
Why, you hairy little thief.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.709
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.170
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

35:31.171 --> 35:34.515
but it's hard to make out.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.979
Aah!

35:48.980 --> 35:50.606
Oy!

35:50.690 --> 35:55.986
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.738
Hang on a second.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.240
Whoa! Whoa!

36:00.241 --> 36:02.743
Does it feel good
to be outta there.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.953
I'm telling you, nice to be
back, ladies and gentlemen.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.955
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

36:06.956 --> 36:08.624
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.543
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.796
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

36:13.797 --> 36:18.473
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

36:18.927 --> 36:21.345
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.264
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

36:24.265 --> 36:26.975
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope
I didn't singe the fur.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.645
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen
you in a few millennia.

36:29.646 --> 36:33.273
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

36:33.274 --> 36:37.111
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.487
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.698
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

36:40.699 --> 36:43.701
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

36:43.702 --> 36:46.870
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.123
The ever impressive,

36:49.124 --> 36:52.418
the long contained,

36:52.419 --> 36:53.502
the often imitated,

36:53.503 --> 36:55.629
but never duplicated...

36:55.630 --> 36:57.798
Duplicated, duplicated...

36:57.799 --> 37:01.677
Genie of the Lamp!

37:01.678 --> 37:03.512
Right here direct from the lamp,

37:03.513 --> 37:06.181
right here for your very
much wish fulfillment.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.599
Thank you.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.853
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.814
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.567
That's it. Three. <i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

37:16.568 --> 37:18.986
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.529
Now I know I'm dreaming.

37:20.530 --> 37:24.241
Master, I don't think you quite
realise what you've got here.

37:24.242 --> 37:29.964
So why don't you just ruminate whilst
I illuminate the possibilities.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.500
<i>Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves</i>

37:33.501 --> 37:35.711
<i>Scheherazade had a thousand tales</i>

37:35.712 --> 37:38.172
<i>But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves</i>

37:38.173 --> 37:40.507
<i>You got a brand of
magic never fails</i>

37:40.508 --> 37:43.093
<i>You got some power
In your corner now</i>

37:43.094 --> 37:45.429
<i>Some heavy ammunition in your camp</i>

37:45.430 --> 37:47.931
<i>You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how</i>

37:47.932 --> 37:51.143
<i>See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say</i>

37:51.144 --> 37:55.314
<i>"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"</i>

37:55.315 --> 37:57.775
<i>Let me take your order
Jot it down</i>

37:57.776 --> 38:00.199
<i>You ain't never had
a friend like me</i>

38:00.987 --> 38:05.115
<i>Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'</i>

38:05.116 --> 38:07.576
<i>Come on, whisper
what it is you want</i>

38:07.577 --> 38:09.703
<i>You ain't never had
a friend like me</i>

38:09.704 --> 38:12.456
<i>Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service</i>

38:12.457 --> 38:15.083
<i>You're the boss, the king, the shah</i>

38:15.084 --> 38:17.544
<i>Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish</i>

38:17.545 --> 38:20.672
<i>How 'bout a little more baklava?</i>

38:20.673 --> 38:25.010
<i>Have some of column A
Try all of column B</i>

38:25.011 --> 38:27.387
<i>I'm in the mood to help you, dude</i>

38:27.388 --> 38:30.232
<i>You ain't never had
a friend like me</i>

38:31.392 --> 38:33.769
<i>Oh, my</i>

38:33.770 --> 38:36.188
<i>No, no</i>

38:36.189 --> 38:37.564
<i>My, my</i>

38:38.942 --> 38:41.443
<i>Can your friends do this?</i>

38:41.444 --> 38:43.904
<i>Can your friends do that?</i>

38:43.905 --> 38:46.365
<i>Can your friends pull this</i>

38:46.366 --> 38:48.909
<i>Out their little hat?</i>

38:48.910 --> 38:51.245
<i>Can your friends go poof</i>

38:51.246 --> 38:53.789
<i>Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!</i>

38:53.790 --> 38:57.042
<i>Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"</i>

38:57.043 --> 38:59.336
<i>And then make the sucker disappear?</i>

38:59.337 --> 39:01.922
<i>So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed</i>

39:01.923 --> 39:04.049
<i>I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers</i>

39:04.050 --> 39:06.844
<i>You got me bona fide certified</i>

39:06.845 --> 39:08.929
<i>You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires</i>

39:08.930 --> 39:11.265
<i>I got a powerful
urge to help you out</i>

39:11.266 --> 39:13.600
<i>So what's your wish?
I really wanna know</i>

39:13.601 --> 39:15.936
<i>You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt</i>

39:15.937 --> 39:18.981
<i>All you gotta do is rub like so</i>

39:18.982 --> 39:23.193
<i>Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three</i>

39:23.194 --> 39:25.737
<i>I'm on the job, you big nabob</i>

39:25.738 --> 39:30.450
<i>You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend</i>

39:30.451 --> 39:34.746
<i>You ain't never had a friend</i>

39:34.747 --> 39:38.208
<i>Like me</i>

39:38.209 --> 39:39.926
Ah-ha-ha!

39:40.420 --> 39:42.796
Wah-ha-ha!

39:42.797 --> 39:45.632
<i>You ain't never had
a friend like me</i>

39:47.719 --> 39:50.888
Huh?

39:50.889 --> 39:53.437
So, what'll it be, master?

39:53.641 --> 39:57.352
You're gonna grant me any
three wishes I want, right?

39:57.353 --> 39:58.645
Ah, almost.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.815
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.150
Like?

40:03.151 --> 40:06.278
Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.696
So don't ask.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.031
Rule number two.

40:09.032 --> 40:13.162
I can't make anybody fall
in love with anybody else.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.329
You little <i>ponem</i> there.

40:15.330 --> 40:20.000
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

40:20.001 --> 40:23.345
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.672
Other than that, you got it.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.595
- Hmm.
- Oh!

40:29.344 --> 40:32.512
Provisos? You mean limitations?

40:32.513 --> 40:36.108
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.560
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

40:38.561 --> 40:42.064
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.691
Looks like we're gonna have
to find a way out of here.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.568
Excuse me?

40:46.569 --> 40:49.446
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

40:49.447 --> 40:52.532
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

40:52.533 --> 40:54.618
And all of sudden you're
walking out on me?

40:54.619 --> 40:57.537
I don't think so, not right now.

40:57.538 --> 41:00.040
You're gettin' your
wishes, so sit down!

41:00.041 --> 41:02.376
In case of emergency,

41:02.377 --> 41:04.962
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.381
Keep your hands and
arms inside the carpet.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.759
We're...

41:10.385 --> 41:13.308
Outta here!

41:14.305 --> 41:17.057
Jafar, this is an outrage.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.935
If it weren't for all your
years of loyal service...

41:19.936 --> 41:24.398
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

41:24.399 --> 41:26.984
before they are beheaded.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.028
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.530
Jasmine...

41:31.531 --> 41:36.368
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

41:36.369 --> 41:37.577
Please.

41:37.578 --> 41:42.207
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.377
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

41:45.378 --> 41:49.506
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.552
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

41:53.553 --> 41:58.183
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

41:58.307 --> 42:00.184
Jasmine!

42:01.644 --> 42:05.022
If only I had gotten that lamp.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.316
"I will have the power
to get rid of you."

42:08.317 --> 42:11.862
To think we gotta keep kissing up

42:11.863 --> 42:15.615
to that chump and
his chump daughter

42:15.616 --> 42:18.201
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

42:18.202 --> 42:22.289
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.417
Then she'll have us banished.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.710
Or beheaded.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.713
Eww!

42:29.714 --> 42:31.715
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.634
What if you were the chump husband?

42:34.635 --> 42:35.927
What?

42:35.928 --> 42:39.306
Okay, you marry the
princess, all right?

42:39.307 --> 42:42.851
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.399
Oh.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.314
Marry the shrew.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.191
I become the sultan.

42:49.192 --> 42:53.153
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

42:53.154 --> 42:59.826
And then we drop papa-in-law and
the little woman off a cliff.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.828
Yaaah!

43:01.829 --> 43:03.747
Kersplat!

43:05.166 --> 43:08.960
I love the way your
foul little mind works.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.681
Thank you for choosing Magic
Carpet for all your travel needs.

43:21.682 --> 43:25.352
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

43:25.353 --> 43:28.563
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

43:28.564 --> 43:33.026
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

43:33.027 --> 43:37.864
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.991
Dost mine ears deceive me?

43:39.992 --> 43:43.161
Three? You are down by one, boy.

43:43.162 --> 43:47.040
Ah, no. I never actually
wished to get out of the cave.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.293
You did that on your own.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.213
Well, I feel sheepish.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.508
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

43:56.509 --> 43:59.719
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.930
I want them to be good.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.723
What would you wish for?

44:03.724 --> 44:05.601
Me?

44:05.893 --> 44:08.061
No one's ever asked me that before.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.439
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.066
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

44:13.067 --> 44:15.569
Come on. Tell me.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.487
Freedom.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.613
You're a prisoner?

44:18.614 --> 44:21.074
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.828
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

44:24.829 --> 44:26.329
Itty bitty living space.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.582
Genie, that's terrible.

44:28.583 --> 44:31.751
But, oh, to be free...

44:31.752 --> 44:33.712
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?

44:33.713 --> 44:36.256
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

44:36.257 --> 44:38.258
To be my own master.

44:38.259 --> 44:41.219
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

44:41.220 --> 44:44.598
and all the treasures
in all the world.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.974
But what am I talking about?

44:45.975 --> 44:48.435
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.937
Genie, wake up and
smell the hummus.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.230
Why not?

44:52.231 --> 44:56.276
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

44:56.277 --> 44:58.820
So you can guess how
often that's happened.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.488
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

45:00.489 --> 45:04.826
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.494
After I make my first two wishes,

45:06.495 --> 45:09.293
I'll use my third
wish to set you free.

45:09.665 --> 45:12.209
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.419
Let's make some magic.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.639
So how 'bout it? What
is it you want most?

45:17.882 --> 45:21.384
Well, there's this girl.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.510
Wrong.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.347
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

45:25.348 --> 45:29.809
Oh, but, Genie, she's
smart and fun and...

45:29.810 --> 45:31.853
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

45:31.854 --> 45:35.148
She's got these eyes that
just... And this hair. Wow.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.776
And her smile...

45:37.777 --> 45:39.449
<i>Ami.</i>

45:39.487 --> 45:41.321
<i>C'est l'amour.</i>

45:41.322 --> 45:43.448
But she's the princess.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.909
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

45:45.910 --> 45:48.870
Hey, can you make me a prince?

45:48.871 --> 45:50.288
Let's see here.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.124
Chicken à la king? Nope.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.378
Alaskan king crab. Ow.
I hate it when they do that.

45:56.379 --> 45:58.922
Caesar salad. Ah! <i>Et tu, Brute?</i> No.

45:58.923 --> 46:02.302
Aha. "To make a prince."

46:02.343 --> 46:04.761
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.681
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

46:07.682 --> 46:09.182
All right!

46:09.183 --> 46:10.517
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

46:10.518 --> 46:14.646
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.690
These patches. What are
we trying to say, beggar?

46:16.691 --> 46:19.410
No. Let's work with me here.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.362
Ooh. I like it. <i>Muy macho.</i>

46:22.363 --> 46:25.532
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

46:25.533 --> 46:28.368
It says mode of transportation.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.329
Excuse me, monkey boy.
<i>Aquí.</i> Over here.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.623
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.584
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

46:36.585 --> 46:40.255
than riding your very
own, brand-new camel?

46:40.256 --> 46:41.589
Watch out. They spit.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.138
Mmm. Not enough.

46:44.885 --> 46:48.889
Still not enough. Let's see.
What do you need?

46:49.765 --> 46:51.016
Yes!

46:51.017 --> 46:54.066
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.729
Whoa!

46:55.730 --> 46:58.858
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.949
Abu, you look good.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.243
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.329
But we're not through yet.

47:12.330 --> 47:17.381
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

47:25.217 --> 47:28.762
Sire, I've found a solution to
the problem with your daughter.

47:28.763 --> 47:31.931
Awk. The problem
with your daughter.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.725
Oh, really?

47:33.726 --> 47:35.569
Right here.

47:35.644 --> 47:39.606
"If the princess has not chosen a
husband by the appointed time,

47:39.607 --> 47:42.650
"then the sultan shall
choose for her."

47:42.651 --> 47:45.987
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.073
How could I choose
someone she hates?

47:48.074 --> 47:50.952
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

47:51.827 --> 47:54.913
"If in the event a suitable
prince cannot be found..."

47:54.914 --> 47:55.997
Jerk.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.968
"A princess must then be wed to..."

48:00.628 --> 48:03.213
Hmm. Interesting.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.964
What? Who?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.591
The royal vizier.

48:06.592 --> 48:10.437
Why, that would be me.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.433
But I thought the law says that
only a prince can marry a princess.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.810
I'm quite sure that...

48:16.811 --> 48:20.941
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.489
Yes. Desperate measures.

48:24.610 --> 48:28.655
You will order the
princess to marry me.

48:28.656 --> 48:33.878
I will order the princess to...

48:34.036 --> 48:36.496
But you're so old.

48:36.497 --> 48:40.125
The princess will marry me.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.668
The princess will marry...

48:41.669 --> 48:44.462
What? What is that?

48:44.463 --> 48:46.260
That music.

48:50.094 --> 48:53.188
Jafar, you must come and see this.

48:55.558 --> 49:00.029
<i>Make way for Prince Ali</i>

49:00.729 --> 49:06.568
<i>Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"</i>

49:06.569 --> 49:08.736
<i>Hey, clear the way
in the old bazaar</i>

49:08.737 --> 49:11.406
<i>Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star</i>

49:11.407 --> 49:15.502
<i>Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye</i>

49:16.579 --> 49:19.247
<i>Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums</i>

49:19.248 --> 49:21.291
<i>You're gonna love this guy</i>

49:21.292 --> 49:26.296
<i>Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa</i>

49:26.297 --> 49:30.893
<i>Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee</i>

49:31.218 --> 49:33.845
<i>Now, try your best to stay calm</i>

49:33.846 --> 49:36.014
<i>Brush up your Sunday salaam</i>

49:36.015 --> 49:40.518
<i>Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie</i>

49:40.519 --> 49:45.273
<i>Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa</i>

49:45.274 --> 49:49.699
<i>Strong as 10 regular men definitely</i>

49:50.237 --> 49:52.572
<i>He faced the galloping hordes</i>

49:52.573 --> 49:54.908
<i>A hundred bad guys with swords</i>

49:54.909 --> 49:59.245
<i>Who sent those goons to
their lords? Why, Prince Ali</i>

49:59.246 --> 50:02.582
<i>He's got 75 golden camels</i>

50:02.583 --> 50:04.125
Don't they look lovely, June?

50:04.126 --> 50:07.003
<i>Purple peacocks, he's got 53</i>

50:07.004 --> 50:08.671
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.

50:08.672 --> 50:13.301
<i>When it comes to
exotic-type mammals</i>

50:13.302 --> 50:15.261
<i>Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you</i>

50:15.262 --> 50:17.597
<i>It's a world-class menagerie</i>

50:17.598 --> 50:22.101
<i>Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa</i>

50:22.102 --> 50:26.898
<i>That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee</i>

50:26.899 --> 50:29.150
<i>Well, get on out in that square</i>

50:29.151 --> 50:31.402
<i>Adjust your veil and prepare</i>

50:31.403 --> 50:35.573
<i>To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali</i>

50:35.574 --> 50:39.744
<i>- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys</i>

50:39.745 --> 50:43.456
<i>- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee</i>

50:43.457 --> 50:45.041
<i>He's generous
So generous</i>

50:45.042 --> 50:48.545
<i>He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies</i>

50:48.546 --> 50:51.256
<i>Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him</i>

50:51.257 --> 50:55.301
<i>They're just lousy
with loyalty to Ali</i>

50:55.302 --> 50:58.137
<i>Prince Ali</i>

50:58.138 --> 51:04.811
<i>Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa</i>

51:04.812 --> 51:09.232
<i>Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see</i>

51:09.233 --> 51:11.317
<i>And that, good people, is why</i>

51:11.318 --> 51:13.486
<i>He got dolled up and dropped by</i>

51:13.487 --> 51:15.488
<i>With 60 elephants, llamas galore</i>

51:15.489 --> 51:17.782
<i>With bears and lions
A brass band and more</i>

51:17.783 --> 51:19.534
<i>With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers</i>

51:19.535 --> 51:21.327
<i>His birds that warble on key</i>

51:21.328 --> 51:23.496
<i>Make way</i>

51:23.497 --> 51:30.221
<i>For Prince Ali</i>

51:30.963 --> 51:34.799
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

51:36.010 --> 51:38.052
Your Majesty,

51:38.053 --> 51:40.722
I have journeyed from afar to
seek your daughter's hand.

51:40.723 --> 51:42.557
Prince Ali Ababwa.

51:42.558 --> 51:45.727
Of course. I'm
delighted to meet you.

51:45.728 --> 51:50.023
This is my royal vizier,
Jafar. He's delighted, too.

51:50.024 --> 51:51.774
Ecstatic.

51:51.775 --> 51:54.819
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.070
Whatever.

51:56.071 --> 51:59.240
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

51:59.241 --> 52:02.785
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.378
Ooh.

52:04.413 --> 52:08.082
I don't suppose I might...

52:08.083 --> 52:11.302
Why, certainly,
Your Majesty. Allow me.

52:12.338 --> 52:15.214
Sire, I must advise against this.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.217
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.345
Ow, ow, ow.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.555
Ahh! Whoa!

52:22.556 --> 52:24.774
Look out, here I come.

52:27.186 --> 52:31.439
Just where did you
say you were from?

52:31.440 --> 52:36.319
Oh, much farther than
you've travelled, I'm sure.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.073
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.408
Hey, watch it.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.786
Watch it with the dumb rug.

52:44.787 --> 52:46.834
Aah!

52:46.872 --> 52:48.544
Whew!

52:54.672 --> 52:56.631
Out of the way. I'm
coming in to land.

52:56.632 --> 52:58.549
Jafar, watch this.

52:58.550 --> 53:01.519
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

53:01.929 --> 53:05.848
Yes, I do seem to
have a knack for it.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.309
This is a very impressive youth.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.645
And a prince besides.

53:10.646 --> 53:14.315
If we're lucky, you won't have
to marry Jasmine after all.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.110
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

53:17.111 --> 53:21.781
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

53:21.782 --> 53:24.956
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!

53:25.953 --> 53:28.162
Jasmine will like this one.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.415
And I'm pretty sure I'll
like Princess Jasmine.

53:30.416 --> 53:34.711
Your Highness, no. I must
intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.963
This boy is no different
from the others.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.757
What makes him think he is
worthy of the princess?

53:39.758 --> 53:43.094
Your Majesty, I am
Prince Ali Ababwa.

53:43.095 --> 53:46.139
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

53:46.140 --> 53:47.890
How dare you.

53:47.891 --> 53:51.728
All of you. Standing
around deciding my future?

53:51.729 --> 53:54.982
I am not a prize to be won.

53:55.023 --> 53:57.366
Oh, dear.

53:57.901 --> 54:02.530
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just
give Jasmine time to cool down.

54:02.531 --> 54:07.958
I think it's time to say
good-bye to Prince Abubu.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.291
What am I gonna do?

54:13.292 --> 54:15.752
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

54:15.753 --> 54:19.848
I should've known I couldn't pull
off this stupid prince wish.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.012
So move.

54:26.013 --> 54:27.514
Hey.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.183
That's a good move.

54:30.184 --> 54:33.028
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.729
Genie, I need help.

54:34.730 --> 54:37.523
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.943
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

54:40.944 --> 54:43.446
- Do you got it?
- What?

54:45.949 --> 54:47.241
No way.

54:47.242 --> 54:51.704
If Jasmine found out I was
really some crummy street rat,

54:51.705 --> 54:52.955
she'd laugh at me.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.925
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

54:56.752 --> 55:01.172
Al, all joking aside, you
really ought to be yourself.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.466
Hey, that's the last
thing I wanna be.

55:03.467 --> 55:05.384
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

55:05.385 --> 55:10.061
I just... I gotta be
smooth, cool, confident.

55:11.058 --> 55:13.231
How do I look?

55:13.852 --> 55:16.901
Like a prince.

55:29.076 --> 55:31.670
Princess Jasmine?

55:32.412 --> 55:35.373
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

55:35.374 --> 55:39.001
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.670
I do not want to see you.

55:40.671 --> 55:43.047
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

55:43.048 --> 55:46.301
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.937
So, how's our little beau doing?

55:49.847 --> 55:52.348
Good kitty, take off.

55:52.349 --> 55:53.558
Down, kitty.

55:53.559 --> 55:55.017
Wait. Wait.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.270
Do I know you?

55:57.271 --> 56:00.115
Uh, no. No.

56:00.232 --> 56:04.402
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

56:04.403 --> 56:06.863
The marketplace?

56:06.864 --> 56:09.708
I have servants who go to
the marketplace for me.

56:10.284 --> 56:13.953
Why, I even have servants who go
to the marketplace for my servants,

56:13.954 --> 56:16.047
so it couldn't have
been me you met.

56:16.498 --> 56:20.167
No. I guess not.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.962
Enough about you,
Casanova. Talk about her.

56:22.963 --> 56:25.756
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.341
Anything. Pick a feature.

56:27.342 --> 56:30.344
Ahem. Uh, Princess
Jasmine? You're very...

56:30.345 --> 56:32.138
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

56:32.139 --> 56:33.514
- punctual.
- Punctual.

56:33.515 --> 56:34.807
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.310
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

56:37.311 --> 56:38.436
Hmm.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.530
I'm rich, too, you know.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.900
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.902
I know.

56:45.903 --> 56:49.327
A fine prize for any
prince to marry.

56:49.865 --> 56:52.241
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.910
Warning! Warning!

56:53.911 --> 56:56.505
Right. A prince like you.

56:56.705 --> 57:00.416
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.635
Mayday! Mayday!

57:03.503 --> 57:06.172
Just go jump off a balcony!

57:06.173 --> 57:08.424
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

57:08.425 --> 57:10.301
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

57:10.302 --> 57:14.180
Okay, fine. But remember,
"bee" yourself.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.182
- Yeah, right.
- What?

57:16.183 --> 57:19.186
Uh... Uh, you're right.

57:19.895 --> 57:23.774
You aren't just some
prize to be won.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.535
You should be free to
make your own choice.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.069
I'll go now.

57:28.070 --> 57:30.529
- No!
- What? What?

57:30.530 --> 57:32.031
How...

57:32.032 --> 57:33.783
How are you doing that?

57:33.784 --> 57:37.208
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

57:37.913 --> 57:39.293
You, uh...

57:39.831 --> 57:42.667
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

57:42.668 --> 57:45.670
We could get out of the
palace, see the world.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.469
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

57:49.800 --> 57:52.553
- What?
- Do you trust me?

57:54.554 --> 57:56.397
Yes.

58:11.613 --> 58:15.458
<i>I can show you the world</i>

58:15.659 --> 58:19.495
<i>Shining, shimmering, splendid</i>

58:19.496 --> 58:21.247
<i>Tell me, Princess</i>

58:21.248 --> 58:27.253
<i>Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide</i>

58:27.254 --> 58:31.257
<i>I can open your eyes</i>

58:31.258 --> 58:35.011
<i>Take you wonder by wonder</i>

58:35.012 --> 58:37.930
<i>Over, sideways and under</i>

58:37.931 --> 58:41.517
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

58:41.518 --> 58:45.521
<i>A whole new world</i>

58:45.522 --> 58:49.275
<i>A new fantastic point of view</i>

58:49.276 --> 58:54.113
<i>No one to tell us no
Or where to go</i>

58:54.114 --> 58:56.866
<i>Or say we're only dreaming</i>

58:56.867 --> 59:00.703
<i>A whole new world</i>

59:00.704 --> 59:04.790
<i>A dazzling place
I never knew</i>

59:04.791 --> 59:09.378
<i>But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear</i>

59:09.379 --> 59:13.632
<i>That now I'm in
A whole new world with you</i>

59:13.633 --> 59:17.344
<i>Now I'm in
A whole new world with you</i>

59:17.345 --> 59:21.265
<i>Unbelievable sights</i>

59:21.266 --> 59:24.894
<i>Indescribable feeling</i>

59:24.895 --> 59:27.980
<i>Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</i>

59:27.981 --> 59:31.192
<i>Through an endless diamond sky</i>

59:31.193 --> 59:35.154
<i>- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes</i>

59:35.155 --> 59:38.991
<i>- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better</i>

59:38.992 --> 59:43.329
<i>I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far</i>

59:43.330 --> 59:46.791
<i>I can't go back to
where I used to be</i>

59:46.792 --> 59:50.086
<i>- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise</i>

59:50.087 --> 59:54.173
<i>- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter</i>

59:54.174 --> 59:58.761
<i>I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare</i>

59:58.762 --> 01:00:05.518
<i>Let me share
This whole new world with you</i>

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:09.313
<i>- A whole new world
- A whole new world</i>

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:13.359
<i>- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be</i>

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.655
<i>- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place</i>

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:21.877
<i>For you and me</i>

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.264
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.722
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.975
Nah. He hates fireworks.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.893
He doesn't like flying, either.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:51.981
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.233
You are the boy from
the market. I knew it.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.652
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.445
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.447
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:04.660
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.745
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.919
The truth?

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.552
The truth. Um...

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.379
The truth is...

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.465
I sometimes dress
as a commoner, um,

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:21.435
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.519
But I really am a prince.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.767
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.145
Well, you know,

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:33.772
royalty going out into
the city in disguise,

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.317
it sounds a little
strange, don't you think?

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.035
Hmm.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.283
Not that strange.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.804
Good night, my handsome prince.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.727
Sleep well, Princess.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.382
Yes!

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:41.465
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.680
Abu. Abu.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.774
Hold him.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.690
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.066
Why, you...

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:02.036
Make sure he's never found.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:48.240
Never fails. You get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.576
Hello? AI?

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:54.126
Al! Kid, snap out of it.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.082
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.669
You have to say, "Genie, I want
you to save my life." Got it?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.343
Come on, Aladdin!

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.633
I'll take that as a yes.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.093
Up scope.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.397
Don't you scare me like that.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:23.692
Genie, I, uh...

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.740
I...

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.114
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.709
I'm gettin' kind of
fond of you, kid.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:34.244
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.169
Jasmine.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:46.173
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.968
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.097
I have chosen a husband for you.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.016
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:00.687
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.986
I will never marry you.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.819
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.029
Better check your crystal
ball again, Jafar.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.823
Prince Ali!

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:13.827
How in the... Uh. Awk!

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:17.413
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.582
What? Ridiculous
nonsense, Your Highness.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.793
He is obviously lying.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:25.295
Obviously lying.

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.423
Father, what's wrong with you?

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.551
I know what's wrong.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.344
Oh, my!

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.055
Your Highness, Jafar's been
controlling you with this.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:38.183
What? Jafar?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.686
You, you traitor!

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.896
Your Majesty, all this
can be explained.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:45.023
Guards! Guards!

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.234
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.194
Just dig a grave for both
of us. We're dead.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:52.322
Arrest Jafar at once.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:55.042
This is not done yet, boy.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:02.040
Find him! Search everywhere!

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.626
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.671
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor,

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.256
plotting against me all this time.

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:11.675
This is horrible, just horrible.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.969
How will I ever...

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.722
Huh?

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.890
Can this be true?

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:21.602
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:25.198
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:28.650
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.245
I won't. I'll leave that to my...

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.906
But you two will be wed at once.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:37.159
Yes, yes. And you'll be
happy and prosperous,

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.537
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.788
- Sultan?
- Yes.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.124
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.585
a person of your unimpeachable
moral character

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:50.260
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.176
We gotta get outta here. I gotta
start packing. Only essentials.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.260
We gotta travel light.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.597
Bring the guns, the weapons, the
knives, and how about this picture?

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.433
I think I'm making
a weird face in it.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:08.023
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:12.119
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.779
Good grip.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.783
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:20.994
- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.664
But you are going to
relieve him of it.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.257
Me?

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.754
Sultan?

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.552
They want me to be Sultan?

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.092
Huzzah!

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.886
<i>Hail the conquering hero</i>

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.480
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.029
What are you gonna do next?

01:07:56.781 --> 01:08:01.536
Psst. Your line is, "I'm
going to free the genie."

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.828
Any time.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.290
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.793
You just go, "Genie,
I wish you free."

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.461
I'm serious.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.173
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.343
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.970
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.390
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.019
The only reason anyone thinks I'm
worth anything is because of you.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.270
What if they find out I'm
not really a prince?

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:32.941
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:36.446
Genie, I can't keep
this up on my own.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.286
I can't wish you free.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:43.952
Fine. I understand. After all,
you've lied to everyone else.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.537
Hey, I was beginning
to feel left out.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:49.837
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.380
Genie, I'm really sorry.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:09:00.807
Well, fine. Then
just stay in there.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.055
What are you guys looking at?

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.603
Look, I... I'm sorry.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.854
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.279
Wait. Come on.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.741
What am I doing?

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.915
Genie's right.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.372
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:32.046
Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.380
Well, here goes.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.889
Jasmine? Where are you?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.091
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:42.595
I'm coming.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:48.934
You got a problem, Pinky?

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.102
Jerk.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.649
Boy, Jafar's gonna
be happy to see you.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.317
"Excellent work, Iago."

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.652
Ah, go on.

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:02.572
"No, really. On a scale of
one to 10, you are an 11."

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.991
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.415
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.789
People of Agrabah,

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:15.794
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.171
Jasmine.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:20.424
Ali, where have you been?

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.467
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.595
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:28.181
No. But, Jasmine,
listen to me, please.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.808
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:32.811
Ali Ababwa!

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.688
Oh, boy.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.820
Look at them, cheering
that little pipsqueak.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:44.494
Let them cheer.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.826
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.662
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.498
will be played by a tall,
dark and sinister ugly man.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.918
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:00.255
Genie, grant me my first wish.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:04.351
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:11.391
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.269
What is this? What's going on?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.521
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:18.064
Father.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.695
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.865
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.242
Oh, yeah? We'll just
see about that.

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:32.370
The lamp.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.875
Finders keepers, Abubu.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.599
Genie, no!

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.728
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:59.189
Jafar, I order you to stop.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.608
Ah, but there's a new order now.

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:03.443
My order.

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:06.655
Finally, you will bow to me.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.365
We will never bow to you.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.742
Why am I not surprised?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.328
If you won't bow before a sultan,

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.581
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.917
Genie, my second wish...

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:24.923
I wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world!

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:27.597
Genie, stop!

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.262
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:36.017
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.270
Now, where were we?

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:42.776
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.238
Down, boy.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.614
Oh, Princess.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:52.659
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.202
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.454
<i>Prince Ali
Yes, it is he</i>

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.832
<i>But not as you know him</i>

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:03.429
<i>Read my lips
And come to grips with reality</i>

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.006
<i>Yes, meet a blast from your past</i>

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:08.466
<i>Whose lies were too good to last</i>

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.845
<i>Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali</i>

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:14.639
Or should we say Aladdin?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.807
Ali?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:19.185
Jasmine, I tried to
tell you. I'm just...

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:23.648
<i>So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin</i>

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.734
<i>Just a con, need I go on</i>

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.278
<i>Take it from me</i>

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.488
<i>His personality flaws</i>

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.616
<i>Give me adequate cause</i>

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:34.659
<i>To send him packing
On a one-way trip</i>

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.744
Genie!

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.329
<i>So his prospects
Take a terminal dip</i>

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:43.084
<i>His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!</i>

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.795
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:51.348
<i>Ex-Prince Ali</i>

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.120
Abu.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.797
Abu!

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:26.878
Oh, this is all my fault.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:30.548
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:34.724
- Abu. Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.180
I'm sorry, Abu.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.307
I made a mess of everything.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:43.688
Somehow, I gotta go back
and set things right.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.704
Carpet.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.743
Abu, start digging.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.207
That's it.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.226
Yeah! All right!

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.827
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:37.032
Puppet ruler want a cracker?

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:40.201
Here's your cracker. Shove them
all the way down your throat.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.578
Here. Have lots.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:45.665
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:51.759
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.550
A beautiful desert
bloom such as yourself

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.763
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.681
What do you say, my dear?

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:04.309
Why, with you as my queen...

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.904
Never.

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:09.481
I'll teach you some respect.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.699
No. Genie.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.156
I have decided to
make my final wish.

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.034
I wish for Princess Jasmine

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:24.459
to fall desperately
in love with me.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:33.713
Ah, Master, there are a few
addendas, some quid pro quos...

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.174
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:41.304
You will do what I order
you to do, slave.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.024
Jafar.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:50.531
I never realised how
incredibly handsome you are.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:54.739
Mmm. That's better.

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:58.363
Now, pussycat,

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.366
tell me more about myself.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:06.373
You're tall, dark,

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:09.040
well dressed...

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.376
AI. AI, little buddy.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:13.003
Shh.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.799
Al, I can't help you.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.885
I work for <i>Señor</i> Psychopath
now. What are you gonna do?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.889
Hey, I'm a street rat,
remember? I'll improvise.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:28.439
Cute little gaps
between your teeth.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.562
Go on.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:36.490
And your beard is so twisted.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:41.823
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jafar...

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:45.577
And the street rat?

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:48.080
What street rat?

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:58.466
Yech!

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.556
That was...

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.019
You!

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.856
How many times do I
have to kill you, boy?

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.944
Get the lamp.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.609
No!

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.945
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:26.334
Jasmine.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.663
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.842
Don't toy with me.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:35.793
Abu!

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:39.088
Things are unravelling
fast now, boy.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.843
Get the point?

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.939
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:58.321
Are you afraid to fight me
yourself, you cowardly snake?

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:01.236
A snake, am I?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:06.664
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.468
<i>Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake</i>

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.178
You stay out of this.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.933
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:36.855
Aladdin.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.917
Jasmine, hang on.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:53.922
You little fool.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:59.836
You thought you could defeat the
most powerful being on Earth.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:03.339
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.552
Without the genie,
boy, you're nothing.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.772
The genie. The genie.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.349
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.434
What?

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:17.395
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:20.064
Al, what are you doing? Why are
you bringing me into this?

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:24.286
Face it, Jafar. You're
still just second best.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.404
You're right.

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:29.991
His power does exceed my own.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.452
But not for long.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:35.621
The boy is crazy. He's
a little punch-drunk.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.373
One too many hits with the snake.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:40.293
Slave, I make my third wish.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:44.970
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.355
All right, your wish is my
command. Way to go, Al.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.862
Yes.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.607
Yes!

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.317
The power.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:11.949
The absolute power!

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.794
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:20.541
The universe is mine to
command, to control!

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:24.128
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't
you forgetting something?

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:27.465
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:28.758
What?

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:31.387
And everything that goes with it.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.806
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:36.808
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:39.852
You're the genie. I don't want...

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.646
Itty bitty living space.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:45.071
Al, you little genius, you.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.500
Ahh!

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.833
Get your blasted
beak out of my face.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:05.503
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:06.754
Allow me.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:10.842
Ten thousand years in a Cave of
Wonders ought to chill him out.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.559
Shut up!

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:23.025
Jasmine...

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.441
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.319
I know why you did.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:34.574
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:38.045
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.330
I love you.

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:45.042
Al, no problem. You've
still got one wish left.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.211
Just say the word and
you're a prince again.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.380
But, Genie, what
about your freedom?

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.592
Hey, it's only an
eternity of servitude.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:54.594
This is love.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:59.056
Al, you're not gonna find another
girl like her in a million years.

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.730
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.729
Jasmine, I do love you,

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:08.575
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.861
I understand.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:15.072
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.909
One bona fide prince
pedigree coming up.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:21.584
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:44.810
I'm free. I'm free.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:47.188
Quick. Quick. Wish for
something outrageous.

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:49.565
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:52.443
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.614
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

01:23:56.615 --> 01:24:00.076
I'm free! I'm free at last!

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:03.797
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off
to see the world. I'm...

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.881
Genie, I'm...

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.467
I'm gonna miss you.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.141
Me, too, Al.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.640
No matter what anybody says,

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.194
you'll always be a prince to me.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.104
That's right.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:31.779
You've certainly proven your
worth as far as I'm concerned.

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:34.944
It's that law that's the problem.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:38.197
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.907
From this day forth,

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:44.870
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.840
Him. I choose...

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:51.677
I choose you, Aladdin.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.215
Call me Al.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:59.260
Oh, all of you, come over
here. Big group hug.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:01.053
Group hug.

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:03.147
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:04.682
Ooh, hairball.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.310
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.854
I'm outta here!

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.356
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.109
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.819
No, I'm mythology.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:20.244
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
