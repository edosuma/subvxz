00:59.960 --> 01:02.270
<i>Mr. Rusk?</i>

01:05.040 --> 01:07.191
<i>Mr. Rusk.</i>

01:10.840 --> 01:13.036
<i>Mr. Rusk.</i>

01:13.120 --> 01:14.554
<i>Boss, are you there?</i>

01:15.840 --> 01:17.593
Mia,

01:17.720 --> 01:19.791
out of curiosity,
what part of hold my calls

01:19.880 --> 01:21.234
couldn't you wrap
your head around?

01:21.320 --> 01:22.549
I'm in a meeting.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.750
<i>I'm sorry. It's Harold,</i>

01:23.840 --> 01:25.672
<i>and I think that
there's something wrong.</i>

01:31.480 --> 01:33.631
Harold? Uh...

01:35.000 --> 01:37.037
Put him through.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.710
<i>Richard!</i>

01:38.800 --> 01:41.759
Harold. What happened, buddy?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.559
Why didn't you come back
with me and Elaine?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.313
<i>Richard,
I've been taken.</i>

01:45.400 --> 01:47.119
Taken?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.919
<i>Elaine, Elaine,
I've been kidnapped.</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:51.589
Turn it down.
Turn it down.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.160
<i>They have got
a gun to my head!</i>

01:53.720 --> 01:56.030
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?</i>

01:56.120 --> 01:59.113
Calm down and explain,
as clearly as you can, what's going on.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.312
<i>I am somewhere in Mexico
with a gun to my head!</i>

02:02.400 --> 02:03.914
<i>I don't know
how much clearer I can be!</i>

02:04.000 --> 02:04.990
Holy fuck!

02:05.200 --> 02:08.271
Harold, it's okay,
we're here. Um...

02:08.440 --> 02:10.396
Ask what they want.
What do they want?

02:11.480 --> 02:13.711
<i>They want five million
wired to an account.</i>

02:14.160 --> 02:16.311
<i>Or they're going to hang me
from a bridge!</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:19.438
Five million what, pesos?

02:19.600 --> 02:22.718
<i>- Pesos? Dollars!</i>
- We're so fucked.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.720
Harold?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.439
Walk Riley.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.434
<i>...and snow
continuing to linger.</i>

02:46.560 --> 02:48.199
<i>Everyone in Chicago
is complaining,</i>

02:48.280 --> 02:49.760
<i>and I say, hey, come on,
let's turn it around.</i>

03:00.280 --> 03:02.840
Here.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.917
- I love you.
- Mmm.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.595
- Say hi to Stu.
- I will!

03:50.320 --> 03:52.630
Maybe the beach holiday
will have to wait.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.278
But I must get a second car.
Bonnie keeps bringing it up.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.431
Shit. Bonnie is the one
that's killing you.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.636
I mean, look,

04:00.760 --> 04:01.830
don't get me wrong,
I know you love her and all,

04:01.920 --> 04:03.479
but your wife's
the reason that

04:03.560 --> 04:05.631
that's all fucked up, okay?

04:05.720 --> 04:08.918
The loans,
the insane office space.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.912
She's got one client.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.150
She should be working
out of your garage,

04:12.240 --> 04:13.913
not leasing space
at the damn Franklin Center.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.560
Listen, as your accountant,
I have to tell you,

04:16.640 --> 04:18.120
she's dragging you
in some deep water, Harold.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.394
Like bankruptcy-deep.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.154
So, are you saying
that I am cash poor?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.791
No, I'm saying
you're poor-poor, nigga.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.837
Plus, word on the street

04:26.920 --> 04:29.754
is that Promethium is about to
be gobbled up by Powell or AFT.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.274
If there's a merger,

04:31.360 --> 04:32.953
you could be looking
for another job.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.190
What?

04:36.200 --> 04:37.634
I haven't heard
anything about that.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.710
Look, man...

04:38.840 --> 04:40.991
I do taxes for half
the Powell brass,

04:41.080 --> 04:42.480
and this shit is real.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.517
Stewart, Richard wouldn't
do that to me.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.717
He's my friend, okay?

04:46.960 --> 04:49.759
Richard has a vanity
license plate, Harold.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.400
He does push-ups
in his goddamn office.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.591
Richard would do that to you.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.039
Good morning.
Promethium Pharmaceuticals,

05:08.160 --> 05:09.150
how can I help you?

05:24.880 --> 05:28.840
Harold! Man, it's 9:20!
You're late again!

05:30.720 --> 05:32.393
What do you call this?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.755
- I think that's all, Mr. Rusk.
- All right.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.112
- I'll see you at the game.
- Sure.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.396
Come.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.159
Get in here.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.354
I had to do that.
Everybody knows we're friends.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.272
I can't give you
special treatment.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.510
Sorry, Richard.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.592
Lake Shore was crazy
this morning.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.517
Sit down.
Hey, Mia, I'm thirsty.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.230
Okay.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.154
You ready
for this game tonight?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.720
Those Benson-Smith cocksuckers

06:07.800 --> 06:09.029
are begging
for an ass kicking.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.713
I am gonna give it to them.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.314
- Here.
- Thank you.

06:13.000 --> 06:13.990
Yeah, and then tomorrow,

06:14.080 --> 06:15.958
you and me are gonna have
a little fun in Mexico.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.350
What?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.437
Elaine and I are gonna
join you on this trip.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.556
You're not the only one

06:21.640 --> 06:23.154
who could go
for a little sunshine.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.834
This is because
of the missing inventory.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.714
Look, I plan to speak to Sanchez
to get to the bottom of that.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.473
No, Elaine and I
will speak to Sanchez.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.791
We just wanna check on
a few things down there.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.870
Um...

06:34.320 --> 06:36.357
I need you to put
all the Mexico files in this,

06:36.440 --> 06:37.669
and give it to Elaine.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.394
Yo, thanks, buddy.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.400
Richard,

06:52.200 --> 06:54.112
is everything okay here?

06:55.080 --> 06:56.673
It's just I heard a rumor,

06:56.760 --> 06:59.719
something about
a possible merger.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.039
Harold, listen.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.991
When you needed a job,
and you came to me,

07:11.080 --> 07:12.355
I said, if you stuck with me,

07:12.440 --> 07:16.070
your life is gonna look
like a rap video. Right?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.711
And haven't I always
looked after you?

07:18.800 --> 07:21.679
I give you an incredible position
as Operations Supervisor.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.716
Yes.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.230
- I handed you the Mexican assignment.
- Yes.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.472
I give Bonnie a job
designing my loft,

07:28.560 --> 07:31.280
and she has fuck-all
for experience.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.430
That was generous.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.796
Trust me,
fucking be patient, man.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.678
And everything's
gonna get revealed.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.274
Why don't you
reveal it to me...

07:39.040 --> 07:40.030
now?

07:42.760 --> 07:45.594
Have I told you
about the two gorillas?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.599
I read it in this book.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.514
Two gorillas, right?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.637
And every day,
they get fed carrots.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.110
And every day they eat the carrots,
no problem.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.953
Chomp, chomp, chomp.
So delicious.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.434
Except, one day, the handler,

07:58.520 --> 08:00.876
he gives one of the gorillas
a banana,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.071
and the other guy
still gets his carrots,

08:03.160 --> 08:04.799
and he doesn't wanna
eat the carrots.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.437
You know why? 'Cause he's seen
the other guy eat the banana.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.675
You know what I'm saying?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.720
Harold.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.198
Eat your fucking carrots

08:20.720 --> 08:22.791
'cause I have
your back, right?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.631
And then you're gonna be
dick-deep in banana

08:25.720 --> 08:26.756
before you know it.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.634
Right? Rap video.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.756
Mia. Hungry.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.795
Receipt's in the bag.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.240
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.190
Stop.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.995
Wow. All of that
without professional training.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.275
That's good, man.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.477
You don't have to be
a dick about it!

09:20.440 --> 09:21.430
All right.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.114
Spunky, I like it.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.040
You'll get far.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.440
Hey, stranger.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.315
Nelly. What you doing here?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.675
You disappeared on us.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.319
Thought about Monty's
offer yet?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.153
Yeah, you can't come in here
talking about that, all right?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.277
I'm... I'm working.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.357
Yeah. You seem super busy.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.040
Yeah, well, these babies don't
polish themselves, all right?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.476
So, are you in or out?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.599
I can't. It's too dangerous.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.558
Oh, come on, Miles,
don't be a pussy.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.474
You can do this.
Really not that hard.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.200
Right. I really appreciate the pep talk,
but it ain't happening.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.112
But it's just
a couple of pills

10:05.200 --> 10:07.271
from Monty's friend
at some lab,

10:07.360 --> 10:09.716
so he can figure out
what's in it and make his own.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.154
All you gotta do
is bring them back.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.276
It'll be easy.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.317
Plus, it's a free trip
to Mexico.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.390
What more do you want?

10:15.480 --> 10:17.233
Right, so I'll be
like a little drug mule.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.073
Perfect, I'll write you
a thank-you note from prison.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.400
Okay. Fine.
You don't want 20 grand,

10:25.040 --> 10:26.315
that's your business.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.674
20 grand?
I thought you said it was 10.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.079
Yeah, it was. It's 20 now.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.996
For real?

10:40.600 --> 10:43.160
- For real.
- Hmm.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.551
Oh, and you can bring
Guitar Shop Barbie with you.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.114
What was all that about?

11:01.920 --> 11:02.910
What?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.115
- That.
- Oh, nothing.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.999
Ever been to Mexico, babe?

11:33.080 --> 11:34.355
- Richard.
<i>- Hey, listen,</i>

11:34.440 --> 11:35.874
<i>my lunch meeting
ran a little long.</i>

11:35.960 --> 11:38.270
<i>I'm not gonna make it back
to the office before the game.</i>

11:38.680 --> 11:41.639
So do you mind grabbing my bag
for me before you leave?

11:41.920 --> 11:44.640
- <i>It's under my desk.</i>
- Okay.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.395
All right.
I'll see you at the gym.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.920
Hey, sorry.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.794
Just had to deal
with something.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.477
Hey, Mia. Richard asked me to
grab something for the game.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.720
Yeah.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.874
I know,
but not everything needs to make sense, Tony.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.553
Scotland Yard is in England.
Who the fuck can explain that?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.234
Now you're just
fucking boring me.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.954
Can I ask you about something?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.030
Listen.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.150
I'm gonna give you
some advice.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.391
You listening,
Tony Tones? Good.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.711
Stop crying,
go down to unemployment,

13:36.240 --> 13:37.720
start acting
like a fucking man.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.837
That's a foul. Foul!

13:49.920 --> 13:51.400
Oh...

13:52.480 --> 13:53.755
You're kidding me!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.798
How's it going at Richard's?

14:27.880 --> 14:29.075
Fine.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.034
Do you have any leads
on other clients?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.115
Stu's a little worried.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.114
He was saying
that your office space

14:38.200 --> 14:39.953
might be costing
a little too much.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.309
What?

14:43.440 --> 14:45.796
Nothing. It's fine.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.876
I still don't understand
why she gave us her tickets.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.434
I told you,
she's going on tour,

15:01.520 --> 15:02.920
she needs me to pick up
something for her mum.

15:03.000 --> 15:03.990
This way.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.116
- What band is she in?
- Please.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.998
Just be happy we got
a free trip out of it.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.713
I'm happy, of course I am.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.160
I need to piss.
Hold this a sec.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.478
Look, relax.
It'll be fine, all right?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.760
- Fucking hell, mate!
- Sorry.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.035
Easy, tiger.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.150
Harold!

15:34.800 --> 15:37.634
There it is again.
What is that smell?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.474
Fat Willy's barbecue.
I always bring it for Angel.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.350
Angel!

15:47.880 --> 15:48.950
Here you go.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.990
Allow me to introduce
our co-presidents,

15:53.080 --> 15:54.992
Mr. Rusk and Ms. Markinson.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.598
A new app. Amazing.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.796
You know what else is amazing

16:05.880 --> 16:07.553
is actually learning
a foreign language.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.111
<i>Yo quiero</i> Taco Bell, huh?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.310
That's sensational.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.470
Can we get the fuck
outta here?

16:49.480 --> 16:50.470
Harold!

16:50.600 --> 16:51.750
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.878
This is Celerino Sanchez,
our plant manager,

16:54.960 --> 16:57.031
and Roberto Vega,
his right-hand man.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.076
All right,
so you we need to talk to.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.435
Okay.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.795
You, we don't.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.876
My office is this way.
Right.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.637
- Sorry.
- No problem, Harold.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.630
Please have a seat.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.839
- Thank you.
- Harold,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.718
just sit this one out,

17:24.800 --> 17:26.598
and I'll come
get you after, okay?

17:29.960 --> 17:31.440
Holy fuck.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.992
Do they not sell
condoms down here?

17:37.520 --> 17:39.273
Okay, Sanchez.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.400
Do you wanna tell me
what that is?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.995
- It's an inventory report.
- That's right.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.400
What do you think
it's telling me?

17:46.840 --> 17:48.718
Sir, you have to understand...

17:48.800 --> 17:51.190
Oh, just answer
the question, Suarez.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.440
- Sanchez.
- Okay.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.358
The report is telling you
that the inventory is light

17:58.440 --> 17:59.760
as I am still selling

17:59.840 --> 18:02.309
your product to <i>Señor</i> Villegas,
as you requested.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.159
We told you to cut him off.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.880
With all due respect,
that's not the way it works.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.191
Uh, that's exactly
how it works.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.431
I make a product,
I decide who to sell to.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.795
Right?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.792
You get to decide if you want
a future with the company...

18:14.880 --> 18:17.270
Again, <i>con todo respeto,</i>

18:18.040 --> 18:20.191
if I don't continue
to deliver,

18:20.280 --> 18:22.556
I will have no future at all.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.234
When you needed money,
you asked me...

18:24.320 --> 18:28.075
When we needed money, we asked you
to sell some product off the books,

18:29.160 --> 18:31.117
and not say
anything to Harold.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.954
Now, we don't need money.
We're telling you to stop.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.511
I really don't see what is
so difficult to understand-o.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.954
See,
it's a sensitive time

18:38.040 --> 18:39.030
- for the company now.
- Yes!

18:39.120 --> 18:40.315
We're gonna have some people
coming down here,

18:40.400 --> 18:41.550
and they're gonna
look things over.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.036
And we wanna make sure that
everything is in order.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.191
I understand,
but <i>Señor</i> Villegas

18:46.280 --> 18:48.556
is expecting
his usual shipment.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.599
The Black Panther
is not someone to mess with.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.194
You can't scare me with tales

18:53.280 --> 18:55.476
of the big, bad cartels,
all right?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.832
- I know how things work.
- Not in Mexico.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.152
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
we're not in Mexico.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.711
This is an American company
making an American product,

19:05.800 --> 19:07.871
and I'm telling you,
in American,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.639
to make sure
that the inventory's right.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.997
Yes. I mean, if you can
take care of 35 kids,

19:13.080 --> 19:15.959
I think you can handle
one drug dealer.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.638
- No?
<i>- Comprende?</i>

19:19.160 --> 19:21.197
- Okay.
- Let's go.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.399
<i>Gracias. Adiós.</i>

19:26.040 --> 19:27.554
Have a nice day.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.873
Harold, let's go.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.999
Harold,
just so you know,

19:47.120 --> 19:49.237
the inventory thing
worried us.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.516
That's why we came down here
to speak to Sanchez,

19:51.600 --> 19:53.671
just to make sure everything
was on the up and up.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.117
- It's no reflection on you.
- No, certainly not.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.157
You know we value your work.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.913
I was starting to think
it might be something else.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.879
Well, you're hearing things.
He's hearing things.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.318
Harold, when I was
in junior high,

20:08.760 --> 20:11.673
a rumor went around that
I let the lacrosse team

20:11.760 --> 20:14.514
pull a train on me in
the Dairy Queen parking lot.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.079
I hated the lacrosse team.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.880
They were the biggest
bunch of WASPy,

20:20.960 --> 20:24.636
turtle-dicked ass pirates
I ever met in my entire life.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.757
- Here you are, <i>señor.</i>
- Thank you.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.590
And I'd rather give
that waiter a rim job

20:29.680 --> 20:31.433
than eat at a fucking
Dairy Queen.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.117
- What's a rim job?
- It's when...

20:34.200 --> 20:35.793
Don't believe
everything you hear,

20:35.920 --> 20:37.274
is probably
the point here, right?

20:37.360 --> 20:39.272
Exactly.
You're gonna be fine.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.079
We're not selling the company.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.115
All right?

20:47.520 --> 20:48.954
I'll be right back.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.313
I don't think
he knows anything.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.478
- I almost feel bad for the guy.
- Right.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.677
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.190
Seriously.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.354
No, I mean literally.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.195
Someone should literally put
him out of his fucking misery.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.834
Angel.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.550
You can go.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.518
I will see you <i>mañana.</i>

21:17.520 --> 21:18.670
Okay.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.915
But when they married
each other, she was a fatty.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.310
She was, like,
50 pounds heavier than she is today.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.159
I was like,
"Don't do it!"

21:30.040 --> 21:32.714
Fat people are so funny.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.719
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- You wanna come to my room tonight?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.234
Yeah, I'm really tired.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.471
- Hey, buddy.
- What did I miss?

21:40.560 --> 21:44.634
I'm gonna check some e-mails,
and maybe hit the sauna,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.837
after I punch out
a little CrossFit.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.559
Then I'll see you guys
in the morning.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.315
You sure?

22:02.120 --> 22:03.713
Do you...

22:04.760 --> 22:07.594
You know,
I'm gonna crash, too.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.189
It's gonna be
an early flight, so...

22:12.800 --> 22:14.712
- That's it then.
- Good night.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.551
What is your problem?
You just fucking left me.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.360
<i>Right.</i>

22:28.880 --> 22:30.758
<i>Someone should
put him out of his misery.</i>

22:32.840 --> 22:34.559
<i>No, I mean literally.</i>

22:34.640 --> 22:37.758
<i>Someone should literally put
him out of his fucking misery.</i>

22:37.840 --> 22:39.479
<i>Well,
when the sale goes through,</i>

22:39.560 --> 22:42.029
<i>that's the last you're gonna
see of Harold Soyinka.</i>

22:42.120 --> 22:44.351
<i>He is on the 86 list.</i>

22:44.440 --> 22:46.557
<i>Maybe they're gonna
give him severance,</i>

22:46.640 --> 22:50.111
<i>but I just think they're gonna
fucking clean house.</i>

22:50.600 --> 22:52.637
<i>His wife
must be a real winner.</i>

22:53.120 --> 22:54.600
<i>Actually, she is.</i>

22:54.680 --> 22:57.320
<i>But when they married
each other, she was a fatty.</i>

22:57.400 --> 23:00.711
<i>She was, like,
50 pounds heavier than she is today.</i>

23:20.800 --> 23:21.995
Okay.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.877
<i>Richard is supposed
to be my friend.</i>

23:32.960 --> 23:36.078
- It's unbelievable!
- Just unbelievable!

23:36.160 --> 23:37.833
<i>You have
every right to be upset.</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:39.149
I swear...

23:39.680 --> 23:41.512
I know I'm not supposed to
touch the mini-bar,

23:41.600 --> 23:43.080
but I'm going to do it!

23:43.160 --> 23:44.230
You know,
I don't even care anymore!

23:44.360 --> 23:45.555
I'm doing it!
I'm having the Merlot!

23:48.400 --> 23:49.720
<i>I feel horrible.</i>

23:50.440 --> 23:52.193
I should've told you
to your face.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.354
What should you have
told me to my face?

23:59.520 --> 24:02.035
- <i>The e-mail.</i>
- What e-mail?

24:02.840 --> 24:05.275
Just go ahead
with what you were saying.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.430
<i>No, no, no.</i>

24:07.440 --> 24:08.635
What should you have told me?

24:12.240 --> 24:16.154
<i>You know the invisible
gorilla experiment, Harold?</i>

24:16.240 --> 24:19.199
Why is everyone talking about
gorillas all of a sudden?

24:19.280 --> 24:21.192
There's this video, right?

24:21.840 --> 24:24.435
Some people in black shirts,
some people in white shirts.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.636
And you have to count

24:25.720 --> 24:27.837
how many times
the people in white shirts

24:27.920 --> 24:29.149
pass this ball back and forth.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.999
<i>This person in a gorilla suit</i>

24:31.080 --> 24:32.878
<i>walks in the middle
of the group.</i>

24:32.960 --> 24:34.633
<i>The experiment
is whether or not</i>

24:34.720 --> 24:36.791
<i>you're so focused
on the ball</i>

24:36.880 --> 24:38.473
<i>that you miss the gorilla.</i>

24:39.000 --> 24:41.151
<i>You would've been part
of the group that missed it.</i>

24:42.160 --> 24:43.196
Missed what?

24:45.560 --> 24:48.758
<i>I'm having an affair.
I'm leaving you.</i>

24:49.920 --> 24:51.149
That's what the e-mail says.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.713
You didn't notice the gorilla.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.479
So,
the affair is the gorilla?

25:07.760 --> 25:08.830
Yes.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.314
What is the ball?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.598
Is our marriage the ball?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.240
<i>I don't know what the ball is.</i>

25:20.880 --> 25:22.917
I'm not supposed to be

25:24.280 --> 25:26.749
looking for gorillas, Bonnie.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.159
I'm supposed to be
watching the ball.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.833
That's my job.

25:30.920 --> 25:31.910
<i>Sorry!</i>

25:32.000 --> 25:35.277
Why am I always getting
screwed for doing my job!

25:35.360 --> 25:37.431
Tell me who it is.
I want to know!

25:37.520 --> 25:38.636
Who is the gorilla, Bonnie?

25:38.720 --> 25:40.234
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Bonnie!</i>

25:40.880 --> 25:42.314
Bonnie!

25:54.120 --> 25:57.272
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of Bonnie.</i>

25:57.360 --> 25:59.795
<i>At the tone, please record
your voice message.</i>

26:02.840 --> 26:03.876
Ugh!

27:49.760 --> 27:50.750
No?

29:06.680 --> 29:07.670
Psst.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.350
- Still not answering.
- What?

31:02.440 --> 31:03.954
Not like him at all.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.518
I'm not waiting
for this dipshit.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.557
Can you just get in the car?

31:10.680 --> 31:12.558
No wait-o for dipshit-o.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.592
Yeah, we're gonna...

31:14.680 --> 31:15.670
Andelay!

31:15.800 --> 31:18.395
I go to look?

31:18.520 --> 31:20.557
- Yeah. Can you?
- Okay.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.920
- Okay, <i>señor.</i>
- Perfect.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.074
Butler.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.874
Room?

32:39.200 --> 32:40.190
You want a room.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.760
Yes. Yes.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.076
With TV?

32:47.960 --> 32:49.758
Uh... Fine. Yes.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.070
Three hundred.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.510
<i>Gracias.</i>

33:04.480 --> 33:05.800
Come, come.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.074
My name is Ronaldo,
and this is my brother, Ernesto.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.511
Just tell us
if you need something.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.479
Okay. Actually,

33:17.560 --> 33:20.394
do you know where
I can buy a cheap phone?

33:20.960 --> 33:22.758
Uh, yeah,
just across the street.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.757
I just don't get it.
- There's nothing to get, babe.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.910
Seriously.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.593
I told you,
Nelly's just a friend.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.512
You gotta let it go,
all right?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.879
<i>Live life to the fullest,</i>

34:15.960 --> 34:17.996
<i>and leave setbacks behind.</i>

34:19.600 --> 34:22.513
<i>Together,
we can lead pharmaceuticals into the future.</i>

34:23.600 --> 34:27.310
<i>Alleviate. Initiate. Innovate.</i>

34:27.400 --> 34:29.391
<i>With Cannabax.</i>

34:31.199 --> 34:34.876
Medical marijuana is already a
multi-billion dollar industry.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.270
It's already up and running
in 20 states

34:37.360 --> 34:38.953
and the District of Columbia.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.315
If you've got a card,

34:40.400 --> 34:43.472
you can legally rip a bong
in the Lincoln bedroom.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.590
Wow.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.916
All right, look, guys, now,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.275
legally speaking,
isn't this right on the line?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.357
Well, it's on it,
it's not over it.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.319
There's a reason why
we set up the lab in Mexico.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.757
You could be operational
the moment the laws open up.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.356
Marty, you really wanna let
AFT take this from you?

35:02.440 --> 35:05.080
You're gonna be staring at their tail
lights for the rest of all time.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.312
The future of marijuana
is this pill.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.756
You know this product
is revolutionary.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.594
You know that by the time
everybody else catches up,

35:13.680 --> 35:15.717
we will have
established a brand

35:15.840 --> 35:17.672
that can
never be usurped.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.269
Think Pfizer and Viagra.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.716
They got there first.
There ain't no second.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.957
Look...
Most people will tell you

35:32.040 --> 35:33.520
Buzz Aldrin
walked on the moon.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.876
But even a complete retard
will tell you

35:38.960 --> 35:40.838
Neil Armstrong did it first.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.477
And do you know
why he went first?

35:47.040 --> 35:49.874
- He was mission commander?
- Hatch opened on his side?

35:50.720 --> 35:53.997
He went first because he pushed
Buzz Aldrin the fuck out of the way

35:54.080 --> 35:55.992
and seized history
by the ball sack.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.151
That's the story
schools are afraid to teach,

35:58.240 --> 35:59.754
but that's what happened.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.679
I'm satisfied.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.360
Jer?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.230
I'm still not sure about this.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.829
Oh, Jerry!

36:18.920 --> 36:20.991
The club is closing!

36:21.080 --> 36:23.072
We've been dancing all night.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.432
It's time to go home
and fuck.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.910
- Easy, Elaine.
- What, Richard?

36:30.240 --> 36:32.436
Nobody dances all night
unless they wanna fuck.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.157
And Jerry here wants to.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.594
He's just being shy.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.473
I have a gun to my head.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.120
I have a loaded gun
to my head!

36:45.480 --> 36:46.960
Richard.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.040
Richard!
I've been kidnapped!

36:52.800 --> 36:54.519
I have
a loaded gun to my head!

36:57.400 --> 37:00.552
So, you guys understand
what to do?

37:00.640 --> 37:02.597
- Yes? <i>Comprende?</i>
- Yes, yes.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.149
Does he <i>comprende?</i>

37:07.200 --> 37:08.520
Okay, good.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.195
Richard Rusk's office.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.476
<i>Mia!
I need to speak to Richard!</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:31.640
Harold?
<i>I need to speak to Richard!</i>

37:33.760 --> 37:36.832
<i>- Mr. Rusk?</i>
- I said hold my calls.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.434
Mr. Rusk.

37:38.520 --> 37:42.958
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Yes. Fuck me.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.515
<i>Mr. Rusk.</i>

37:46.560 --> 37:48.517
Yeah, right?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.720
<i>Mr. Rusk? Boss, are you there?</i>

37:51.800 --> 37:53.314
Oh, shit.

37:53.520 --> 37:57.150
Mia, out of curiosity,
exactly what part

37:57.240 --> 37:59.277
<i>of "hold my calls" couldn't
you wrap your head around?</i>

37:59.360 --> 38:00.510
<i>I'm in a meeting.</i>

38:01.160 --> 38:02.150
I'm sorry. It's Harold,

38:02.240 --> 38:03.356
and I think that
there's something wrong.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.000
Harold? Uh...

38:07.040 --> 38:08.713
Yeah, put him through.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.396
<i>Harold?</i>

38:14.520 --> 38:15.715
Richard!

38:20.560 --> 38:21.596
Where are you?

38:21.680 --> 38:23.239
Why didn't you come back
with me and Elaine?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.592
Richard, I've been taken!

38:26.640 --> 38:30.236
- Taken?
- Elaine? I've been kidnapped!

38:30.320 --> 38:31.640
They have a gun to my head!

38:31.720 --> 38:33.552
I have a loaded gun
to my head!

38:35.720 --> 38:37.393
No! What are you doing with that?
What are you doing with that?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.153
No, no, no! No! No!

38:39.240 --> 38:40.560
Try and breathe,
calm down,

38:40.640 --> 38:43.474
and explain as clearly
as you can what's going on.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.155
I'm somewhere in Mexico
with a gun to my head!

38:46.240 --> 38:47.390
How much clearer can I be?

38:47.480 --> 38:49.597
Harold, it's okay, we're here.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.560
- Um...
- Ask what they want.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.909
What do they want?

38:53.400 --> 38:55.915
<i>They want five million
wired to an account.</i>

38:56.560 --> 38:58.517
Or they're going to hang me
from the bridge!

38:58.600 --> 39:01.240
Five million what, pesos?

39:01.320 --> 39:03.471
Pesos? Dollars!

39:04.680 --> 39:07.559
<i>Harold, how exactly
did they arrive at a number</i>

39:07.640 --> 39:11.759
<i>like five million dollars
for a person in your position?</i>

39:11.840 --> 39:14.833
You didn't tell them about
the K&R policy, did you?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.718
<i>They came to the hotel
and kidnapped me.</i>

39:17.280 --> 39:20.512
- <i>I had no choice!</i>
- God-fucking-damn it!

39:20.600 --> 39:22.557
- We're so fucked.
- Jesus Christ!

39:22.640 --> 39:24.677
- Shh!
- The number one rule

39:24.760 --> 39:27.320
about having the fucking
insurance policy

39:27.400 --> 39:30.552
<i>is never tell anyone we have
the fucking insurance policy!</i>

39:30.680 --> 39:32.319
<i>Did you not
attend the seminar?</i>

39:32.400 --> 39:33.800
He set up the seminar.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.391
No!

39:39.280 --> 39:41.840
<i>No! Por favor!</i>

39:43.000 --> 39:45.310
- Jesus Christ.
- No!

39:45.720 --> 39:47.598
<i>Really fucking hamstrings</i>

39:47.680 --> 39:49.399
our bargaining position.
You know that, right?

39:49.480 --> 39:50.470
<i>Bargaining?</i>

39:50.560 --> 39:52.074
I just told you
they're going to kill me!

39:52.200 --> 39:53.600
Yes, bargaining!

39:53.680 --> 39:55.956
I'm in business!
That's what I do!

39:56.080 --> 39:58.834
You walk through warehouses,
put little check marks on boxes.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.354
- That's what you do!
- Don't be mean.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.510
What about the policy?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.592
You're going
to have to tell him.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.833
Harold, I'm just
gonna spit this out.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.115
There is no policy.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.190
What?

40:11.280 --> 40:13.112
We had to make cutbacks.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.953
Uh... Fuck.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.670
There was a lot going out.

40:16.760 --> 40:17.750
We didn't have
a lot coming in.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.956
I had to let the policy lapse.

40:20.120 --> 40:23.192
You kept sending me down here
with no insurance?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.919
<i>Yeah,
butjust for a little while.</i>

40:25.000 --> 40:26.036
Why didn't you tell me?

40:26.120 --> 40:28.032
What a fucking crybaby.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.157
There's not enough time
in every day

40:30.280 --> 40:33.398
<i>for us to tell you all the things
we do not need to tell you, Harold!</i>

40:34.600 --> 40:37.434
No! No! No, no! No!

40:44.520 --> 40:45.954
Fucking Mexicans!

41:01.600 --> 41:03.557
- Harold?
- Richard!

41:03.640 --> 41:05.438
All right. Hey, listen.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.115
Harold, I am gonna get you
outta there, I swear to God.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.919
Harold, listen to me
right now.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.072
You tell whoever's got you
that there's no deal

41:13.160 --> 41:14.799
unless they come
way down on the price.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.190
- What?
<i>- Yeah,</i> la cuenta...

41:19.800 --> 41:22.156
Just... Harold,
can we call you back?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.390
What?

41:23.480 --> 41:25.790
<i>- Do you got a number?</i>
- Richard. Richard.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.240
No, I need to speak to legal.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.471
Richard. Richard,
don't leave me...

41:29.560 --> 41:31.711
I'm gonna get someone in here
who speaks Mexican.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.830
<i>No, Richard!
Don't leave me here! Richard!</i>

41:32.920 --> 41:35.071
- Can you call us back?
- Richard! Richard!

41:44.080 --> 41:45.116
<i>Gracias,</i> guys.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.190
Well done.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.236
<i>Vamos.</i>

41:57.880 --> 41:59.109
Shit.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.671
Five million dollars for
someone in middle management.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.558
Do me a favor,
shut the fuck up!

42:06.120 --> 42:07.315
You with your whole fucking,

42:07.400 --> 42:10.120
"Hey, Elaine,
I got the perfect guy for us!

42:10.200 --> 42:12.078
"My good buddy, Harold Sinka!

42:12.200 --> 42:13.600
- Soyinka.
- "He's gonna fucking be perfect for the job.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.239
"He won't ask any questions,

42:15.320 --> 42:16.549
"not gonna cause
any fucking trouble."

42:16.640 --> 42:18.154
This is a fucking clusterfuck!

42:19.960 --> 42:20.996
Just stay focused.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.753
I am focused!

42:26.120 --> 42:29.113
What do we do now?
Do we call the cops?

42:30.240 --> 42:32.880
Would it be such a bad thing
if he didn't come back?

42:32.960 --> 42:34.713
What are you talking about?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.076
We are not leaving Harold
in fucking Mexico!

42:37.200 --> 42:38.395
That's crazy!

42:38.480 --> 42:40.597
You're the one who said
put him out of his misery.

42:40.680 --> 42:44.959
I say crazy shit all the time!
I don't mean it literally!

42:45.080 --> 42:46.719
But you said "literally"
put him out of his misery.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.837
Oh, my fucking...

42:48.960 --> 42:51.714
I meant
not "literally" literally.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.393
"Literally" is something
people say now!

42:53.520 --> 42:56.399
- It doesn't mean a fucking thing!
- Okay.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.358
They're going to be inspecting
the plant tomorrow,

42:58.440 --> 43:00.875
and if they find anything off,
this whole deal is shot.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.755
And I don't need to tell you what's
gonna happen if the Feds catch

43:03.840 --> 43:06.560
fucking wind of any
of this on any level.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.074
We are completely fucked!

43:09.000 --> 43:10.150
I know a guy.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.959
Oh, here we go again.
You know a fucking guy.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.158
No, I know a guy who might be
really good for this kind of thing.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.556
- Extraction...
- Jesus Christ.

43:17.640 --> 43:19.074
Special Ops type things.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.154
Boy...

43:24.880 --> 43:26.758
This is really bad timing.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.400
Fuck this. We've got this.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.678
Richard, we fucking got this.
We're a team.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.395
Look, why don't I come over
to your loft tonight.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.880
We'll just...

43:39.880 --> 43:41.314
I'm not in there yet.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.916
I'm still
at that boutique hotel.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.871
You told me last week
you moved in.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.160
Did I tell you that?
Did I...

43:53.240 --> 43:54.754
I'm gonna make this call.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.878
I gotta just get this thing
sorted out.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.310
Um...

44:01.320 --> 44:04.791
But if I change my mind, I'm gonna give
you a call, which I probably will.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.517
But I'm, you know,
maybe just...

44:10.560 --> 44:12.552
Yeah, so, yeah,
I'll read that.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.630
Good meeting.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.640
- Mia.
- Mmm?

44:17.720 --> 44:19.359
Get my brother
on the phone, now.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.275
Oh, yeah, Mitch?
Yeah, one moment.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.190
Mitch.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.316
Okay.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.511
- Hey, Rich!
- Mitch!

44:50.600 --> 44:51.716
<i>How you doing, bro?</i>

44:52.760 --> 44:56.151
How's... How's Nepal?

44:56.240 --> 44:58.357
Haiti. I'm in Haiti.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.911
- Haiti? No, I knew that.
- How is it?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.912
It's a fucking mess
is what it is.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.957
But we're doing what we can.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.509
Well, you're doing
God's work, so...

45:08.640 --> 45:10.677
No, the earthquake
was God's work.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.632
This is something else, man.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.430
You're seriously
all religious-y and stuff?

45:17.520 --> 45:19.716
It's not religious,
it's spiritual.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.555
And I don't mock your dirty
little money-grabbing,

45:23.640 --> 45:25.950
back-fucking-stabbing
corporate life.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.316
No, it's not... Dude,
I'm not, swear to God.

45:28.400 --> 45:32.519
It's just, I hear through Mom that you've
turned over a new leaf, and it's great.

45:32.600 --> 45:33.636
<i>Mom's right.</i>

45:34.480 --> 45:37.393
I've been good.
I've been doing good things with my life.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.995
<i>I have a new path now.
My mercenary days are over.</i>

45:40.080 --> 45:42.117
Look, what do
you want, Richard?

45:42.200 --> 45:44.760
You only ever call if you want something,
so let's get to that part,

45:44.840 --> 45:46.274
the greedy part,
the selfish part.

45:46.360 --> 45:50.274
All right. You wanna help people, right?
You wanna help people. Help me,

45:50.360 --> 45:52.158
<i>and I will make it
worth your while.</i>

45:52.240 --> 45:54.755
And then you can build these
people a school house

45:54.840 --> 45:57.435
or a fucking Gap,
whatever the fuck they need.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.638
You know, might I remind you that
you were sent there six months ago

46:00.720 --> 46:03.679
to make a diplomat disappear.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.479
You want me
to fucking kill somebody?

46:05.560 --> 46:06.880
<i>Have you lost
your fucking mind?</i>

46:06.960 --> 46:09.759
Hey, man...
<i>Did you not hear a thing I just fucking said?</i>

46:09.840 --> 46:11.911
I don't wanna...

46:12.000 --> 46:15.118
I don't want you to take
anybody out for me.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.429
I'm just...

46:16.520 --> 46:19.558
No, I need you to bring
somebody back.

46:29.560 --> 46:32.234
- What phone is that?
- Hmm? Work gave it to me.

46:36.600 --> 46:40.389
Hey, look, that's that guy
from the room next to ours.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.434
Nice suit.

46:43.520 --> 46:44.510
Why would somebody
wearing a posh suit

46:44.600 --> 46:46.114
be staying at our shit motel?

46:48.080 --> 46:52.757
Miles, he has that like shoulder
holster gun thing under his arms.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.311
Maybe he's a cop.
Or he's like a FBI guy.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.199
Or, no, a DEA guy.
Yeah, he's a DEA guy

46:59.280 --> 47:01.237
on the trail of
some big drug thing,

47:01.320 --> 47:02.879
and he's about
to bust somebody.

47:02.960 --> 47:04.633
Oh, yeah,
somebody's going down!

47:04.720 --> 47:06.200
All right, let's clear off,
shall we?

47:06.280 --> 47:07.919
But I haven't finished
my margarita yet.

47:08.000 --> 47:08.990
You can get one later.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.436
Babe, we're in Mexico.

47:12.520 --> 47:13.715
They brush their teeth
with tequila.

47:13.800 --> 47:14.790
Let's do one.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.790
<i>Amigo!</i>

48:12.240 --> 48:14.152
Oh, for fuck's sake.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.560
Are you crying?

48:22.320 --> 48:23.390
I'm sorry.

48:24.600 --> 48:28.913
Did you not smoke every girl in every
fucking pageant you ever entered?

48:30.120 --> 48:31.349
That's what I thought.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.520
You're a winner, Elaine.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.713
You've always been a winner.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.589
- Who's daddy's blue-ribbon girl?
- Hmm?

48:47.680 --> 48:50.673
That's right... I am.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.520
I'm a blue-ribbon girl.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.559
Now, get your shit together.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.313
Go handle your business.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.235
Richard, it's me.

49:40.880 --> 49:44.112
No, no, no. Shut up.
Shut up and let me do the talking.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.310
<i>Hola,</i> shithead. Better.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.631
<i>Hola,</i> shithead, it's me.
Shut up.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.593
And I know
about all these people

49:56.720 --> 49:59.030
who are going to lose
their job, including me.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.715
And I know that you and Elaine
are having sex.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.912
Richard, you are a bad person.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.639
You know what happens
to bad people?

50:05.720 --> 50:08.633
Bad things.
Bad things happen to bad people.

50:08.720 --> 50:12.760
So you can take your carrot

50:12.840 --> 50:18.279
and shove it up your
motherfucking lying buttocks

50:18.360 --> 50:21.671
because I can have bananas.

50:21.760 --> 50:24.594
Harold Soyinka
can have all the bananas.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.237
I'll have my bananas.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.036
Oh, God.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.074
- It's that weird number.
- Don't! Don't touch it.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.392
- You think it's him?
- Just don't think about it.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.870
God, I'm such a shit.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.350
Bonnie, stop singing
sad Harold songs.

50:46.480 --> 50:50.633
Honey, how many times do I have to tell you?
Guilt is for losers.

50:51.560 --> 50:54.712
Now, you want something,
you go after it.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.951
You fucking
make it happen. Harold?

50:57.040 --> 50:59.191
He just never understood that.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.749
Now, I'm sorry,
he is a nice guy, but,

51:02.800 --> 51:05.998
you know,
never fucking grew a pair.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.151
So, it's that simple.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.234
I know.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.070
Thank you.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.276
- Who could that be?
- I don't know.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.395
- Surprise.
- Oh... Elaine.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.435
Uh...

51:47.200 --> 51:48.190
Okay.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.676
So I see
you moved in after all.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.999
Uh... Yeah.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.513
Who do we have here,
Richard?

52:00.120 --> 52:01.110
Hmm?

52:03.320 --> 52:05.755
Do you have a name?

52:08.200 --> 52:11.557
It's a deaf girl.
She's adorable.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.270
Bonnie, Elaine.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.676
Elaine, Bonnie.
Bonnie is my...

52:17.920 --> 52:19.320
My interior decorator.

52:19.400 --> 52:20.800
That's interesting,
because I thought you said

52:20.880 --> 52:23.156
Harold's wife
was your interior decorator.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.920
Yeah.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.435
Now I see why you wanted
to leave him in Mexico.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.432
- What?
- Elaine.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.276
Ooh.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.474
Would you show me
your stomach?

52:37.560 --> 52:39.517
'Cause I am super curious.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.200
Excuse me?

52:42.320 --> 52:44.232
Richard here told me
you were a little fatty Patty

52:44.320 --> 52:45.310
back in the day.

52:45.400 --> 52:46.390
Isn't that right, Richard?

52:49.280 --> 52:52.671
You know,
I've always wondered,

52:52.760 --> 52:57.915
what do they do with all that
extra skin?

52:58.000 --> 53:01.789
Listen, I don't know
what is going on...

53:01.880 --> 53:03.872
That's right,
you don't know anything.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.437
And you certainly
don't know this guy.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.470
And I bet you don't know

53:13.560 --> 53:16.359
what I had on the plane
to Mexico yesterday.

53:16.440 --> 53:18.238
I don't care
what you had on the plane.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.549
The petit filet.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.754
Four glasses of champagne,

53:21.840 --> 53:24.719
and Richard's cock in my mouth
in the First Class bathroom.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.350
Oh...

53:31.600 --> 53:33.637
It's... Bonnie, she...

53:38.960 --> 53:41.350
Come on, Riley.

53:58.480 --> 54:00.949
Now, what do you say we
christen this fucking place?

54:11.680 --> 54:15.799
Live by the rules,
that is what my father said.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.920
Work hard, respect the rules,
and you become rich in America.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.959
Then you can come back home
a great success.

54:23.040 --> 54:27.319
Bullshit.
One hundred percent bullshit.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.517
- Bullshit.
- Just the other day

54:29.600 --> 54:32.832
Richard invited me
into his office to play chess.

54:32.920 --> 54:36.470
He wanted to show me how much he had
improved since we were at college.

54:36.560 --> 54:42.158
So he's playing white,
and he begins with F-3.

54:42.240 --> 54:45.870
Naturally,
I respond with E-5.

54:45.960 --> 54:48.429
What does
this crazy man do? G-4.

54:48.520 --> 54:51.638
Can you believe it? G-4.
All I have to do

54:51.720 --> 54:55.191
is move my queen
to H-4, checkmate.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.835
But did I do it? No.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.277
Why? Because I had
my father's voice in my head.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.869
"Respect the rules."

55:04.880 --> 55:07.634
As a rule,
you do not defeat your boss,

55:07.720 --> 55:09.473
especially when you want
a promotion.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.349
That is the story
of my time in America.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.400
Play by the rules?

55:16.560 --> 55:17.880
Bullshit.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.033
Are they your friends?

55:37.320 --> 55:38.754
Friendly.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.352
Where is this other bar?

55:53.520 --> 55:58.356
<i>Señor, dónde...
Dónde</i> the other bar?

56:14.280 --> 56:16.237
I need the bathroom.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.552
<i>Amigo. Amigo,</i>
I need the bath...

57:53.720 --> 57:54.836
Mmm-hmm.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.432
Monarch butterflies
go through

58:42.520 --> 58:43.874
four generations each year.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.555
The first three generations
hatch from their cocoon state

58:46.640 --> 58:48.233
and live for up to
six weeks,

58:48.320 --> 58:51.074
but the fourth generation
continues to live on

58:51.160 --> 58:53.516
for up to six
or eight months,

58:53.600 --> 58:55.910
so that they can migrate
to a warmer climate

58:56.000 --> 58:58.276
and birth a new generation
in the spring.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.275
They are one of
the great miracles of nature.

59:04.240 --> 59:06.630
- I've gotta go, baby. Sorry.
- What?

59:07.520 --> 59:09.512
Babe.

59:09.760 --> 59:12.195
If you want to take pictures,
you can do it.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.634
What the fuck?

59:27.640 --> 59:30.280
Babe, how many butterflies
did you need to see? Really.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.712
- What are we doing?
- What?

59:35.840 --> 59:37.479
Why are you with me?

59:37.560 --> 59:38.710
Here we go.

59:38.800 --> 59:40.951
I'm serious, Miles.
Why are you with me?

59:41.040 --> 59:43.236
I don't know, Sunny.
Why are you with me?

59:49.840 --> 59:51.877
That guy looks
like he needs help.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.633
Well, hopefully
someone will pick him up.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.635
That's the guy
from the plaza.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.080
The one with the shoulder holster?
Stop the car, Miles.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.755
- I'm not stopping the car for a fucking DEA agent.
- Stop the fucking car, Miles!

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.513
Please.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.520
Sunny.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.758
You okay?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.036
- Sunny!
- Oh, my God!

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.712
Are you all right? Sir?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.519
Sir, can you hear me? Please?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.159
Sunny, don't touch him!

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.197
Oh, God, he's...
Help me, Miles.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.272
This is good. This is good.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.680
Right, we're here.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.516
- Mr. Rusk?
<i>- What?</i>

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.599
I was just wondering
about Harold.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.520
<i>What about him?</i>

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.717
Well, he didn't sound
so good yesterday,

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.951
and he didn't call in today.
Is he okay?

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.116
Mia, a simple quiz.
The job of a receptionist

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.591
is to A, make calls,
or B, answer them?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.113
- B?
- B, yeah.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.475
Hey, is this everything?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.670
All company policies...

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.753
...contracts, leases, travel
and insurance riders.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.390
Okay, great. Hey,
great game the other night.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.351
I'll be
in the conference room.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.114
No more interruptions.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.839
Yes, sir, Mr. Rusk, sir.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.515
Keep that up, you'll
passive-aggressive yourself

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.670
straight to
the unemployment line,

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.752
then you'll have plenty of
time to worry about Harold.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.950
Asshole.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.637
- Hello.
- <i>Rich, it's Mitch.</i>

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.114
Mitch. Hey. Oh, thank God.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.238
Tell me you found him.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.997
I've tracked down dictators
in caves, Richard.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.799
I can find a guy
in middle management.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.111
Miles will be back soon
with your painkillers.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.793
Those are gonna make you
feel a lot better.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.079
Listen, you are very kind,

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.197
but, really,
I will be okay on my own.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.953
I think you ought
to have someone

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.269
just keep an eye on you.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.714
You're really beat up.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.714
I'm Sunny, by the way.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.629
I never met anyone
named Sunny before.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.395
Well, I never met a Harold.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.353
So we're even, Steven.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.232
You know, if you Google
the name Harold,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.755
it's the most common name
with the least amount

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.957
of famous people
associated with it.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.833
Well, why don't you
go by Harry?

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.070
There are a lot
of famous Harrys,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.675
like that magician
with the water tank.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.720
- Houdini.
- Yeah.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.076
And Harry S. Truman,
the president.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.437
And lots of singers.
Harry Potter, obviously.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.638
I love <i>Harry Potter.</i>
I've read every single book.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.634
Harry.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.072
- Harry Soyinka.
- Yeah, I like that.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.356
Okay, it's official, I'm gonna
call you Harry from now on.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.916
<i>I 've got Jerry on line one.</i>

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.633
- Hey, Jerry!
<i>- Elaine!</i>

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.155
I heard AFT was crying
when they got the news.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.835
<i>Guess they felt like they
danced with you all night, too.</i>

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.310
<i>Someone's gotta
go home alone, right?</i>

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.629
Unless you're into threesomes.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.676
Elaine, so anyway,

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.393
been going over
our departments.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.233
A lot of redundancies.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.913
Fire whoever you want.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.992
<i>Well, the problem
might be right at the top.</i>

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.232
<i>With me and Marty,
we're not gonna need both you and Richard.</i>

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.109
Have you guys
talked about this?

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.355
Hey, Jer, how about
you and I get together

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.800
for a drink tonight?

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.315
<i>Bat a few ideas around.
I don't know.</i>

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.160
Well, well, yeah. Okay.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.755
I'll have my secretary get you
all the information.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.877
- That's great.
- Great.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.191
Hey, Elaine...

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.430
Hello?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.792
Fuck!

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.279
Relax, Richard.
It's under control.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.870
This is a midnight run.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.792
Let's just talk about
the money later, okay?

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.236
<i>Richie, we'll talk about
the money now. All right?</i>

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.875
You tend to have a faulty
memory where money's concerned.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.600
<i>None of
your business bullshit.</i>

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.594
One million for the ransom,
200 grand for me and the Haiti kids.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.717
A million dollars.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.549
A million dollars
for Harold Soyinka.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.115
This is like paying $1,000
for a Whopper Junior.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.840
Yeah, well,
think of it as karma

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.230
- for banging his wife.
<i>- Great, Mitch, just...</i>

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.154
- A million!
- Just go do whatever you do.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.230
<i>All right.</i>

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.516
He'll be on the next
plane to Chicago.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.671
I know that whatever
happened to you

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.910
is none of my business, but

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.878
is there anybody
that you need to call?

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.315
No.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.676
My wife just left me.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.111
What about friends?

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.797
There's no one to call.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.671
Well...

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.558
I like the way
you talk, Harry.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.397
You have a really cool accent.
Are you Jamaican?

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.560
- No.
- Oh...

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.479
I'm Nigerian.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.960
I don't know
much about Nigeria,

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.919
except once I got an e-mail
from a Nigerian prince

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.390
saying that he would give me a
ton of money if I helped him out.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.751
You didn't send him
the money, did you?

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.957
'Cause you might have been
sending it to my uncle.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.633
Your uncle does that?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.599
Like try and steal
from people like that?

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.197
Yes, he's one of those people.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.316
He tried to get
my father to join him,

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.880
but he would not.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.873
Now, my uncle
has lots of houses, land,

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.078
sport cars and a yacht,
and my father is a poor man.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.351
The world
is upside down, Sunny.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.557
I don't think it pays
to be a good person.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.911
I mean, look at you.
You seem to be a good person.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.720
Do you have a sports car?
Do you have a yacht?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.031
I don't need a sports car
or a yacht.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.076
Well, I'm glad you didn't
help my uncle pay for his.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.000
I think you're wrong, Harry.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.719
I think the world
is just fine.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.958
I think it's some of the
people in it who are wrong.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.993
Trust me,
I have good instincts.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.640
I make bad decisions,
but I have good instincts.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.235
You'll see, things are gonna
start to get better for you.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.839
Harry! What's going...

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.630
Wait!

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.440
Okay, okay, okay.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.400
What? I don't understand!

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.631
In your face! In your head!

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.200
<i>Chinga,</i> your head!

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.760
Okay, okay, okay.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.554
- Put it on!
- Put it on!

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.514
Harry!

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.875
Sunny?

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.312
So I couldn't get paracetamol,
but I did...

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.714
Shh.
Richard sent me. Let's go.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.510
What about the ransom?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.716
Why didn't they pay
the ransom?

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.712
Who gives a fuck
about the ransom?

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.350
I'm gonna have you back in the
States in time for dinner.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.837
- Sunny.
- Miles?

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.837
- Miles!
- Sunny?

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.389
Miles? Miles!

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.109
- Sunny!
- Miles, I'm in here!

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.715
- Thank God. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine! Are you okay?

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.156
Yeah. What time is it?

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.392
What? I don't know.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.835
Oh, no.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.990
What?

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.116
Uh...

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.950
Oh, fuck.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.760
- I've gotta go. Um...
- What?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.840
I'm really sorry, babe.
Go to our room, lock the door.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.078
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back soon.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.759
Beginner.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.437
- Professional.
- Ah, <i>sí.</i>

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.549
No.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.310
Hmm?

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.156
Harold?

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.314
Harold!

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.516
Harold, come back here!
Harold!

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.716
Stop! Shit!

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.515
Shit!

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.118
Sorry!

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.119
Excuse me!

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.830
Hey!

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.075
Okay.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.160
Ah!

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.958
The genius wakes.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.670
So,

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.233
riddle me something, shithead.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.837
Why does a man run away

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.037
from someone
who's saved his life? Hmm?

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.710
You don't know?

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.236
Right.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.758
Harold, who are these two?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.320
They are tourists
from the motel.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.752
Really? You sure?

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.357
What about those two assholes?

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.354
They run the motel.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.155
They run the motel?

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.674
Mmm.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.070
You weren't kidnapped,
were you?

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.119
You set this up yourself.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.156
On the one hand,

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.112
I am surprised
you had the balls.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.118
On the other,

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.757
this shit show can only be
the work of a fucking amateur.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.635
Why did you do it? Money?

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.633
Revenge 'cause
he was banging your wife?

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.872
You... You didn't know?

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.000
Oh, shit.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.439
Try not to take it
too personally.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.111
I thought he was my friend.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.554
Remember the story about

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.753
five years ago,
a woman in Pennsylvania

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.952
kept a black bear as a pet.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.510
She looked after it, fed it.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.151
And then one day,
it mauled her, you know?

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.152
She's shocked!

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.471
I mean, she thought
they were friends.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.157
But it's a fucking bear,
Harold.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.551
We're gonna need
a couple new passports

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.356
after that incident
at the airport.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.795
Who would you wanna be?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.837
I'm gonna let you choose
your own name.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.511
You're forging passports?

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.151
This is a magic box,
my friend.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.955
I've been 25 different
people in my life,

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.160
and the 200 grand
I'm getting for your ass

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.670
is going right
into my little account

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.433
in the Grand Caymans.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.195
- 200 thousand?
- Yep.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.758
Is that all I'm worth?

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.400
No, no. I was authorized
to go as high as a million.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.757
Richard's gonna be so happy

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.115
that he doesn't
have to pay it.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.551
He's such a greedy fucker.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.911
So, they don't know
you have me?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.231
No, not yet.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.790
Why would you settle
for 200 thousand,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.394
when you can make
more than double that?

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.033
Oh, Harold.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.350
- You wanna go for the ransom?
- Why not?

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.835
You've already
done the hard part.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.713
You have me, you have
the off-shore account.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.235
Look at me.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.551
I have no job to go back to,
no wife.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.076
Why do you think I ran?
I cannot go back to Chicago.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.675
My life there
has been a complete lie.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.117
You're waking up, Harold.
I like that.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.315
That's a lot of food packs,

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.351
medical supplies.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.914
All right. Done.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.549
You have a deal, my friend.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.792
But you can forget
about a 50/50 split.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.313
I could kill you right now,

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.954
tell them that
you're still alive,

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.589
and blow off
with the whole million.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.753
But I'm not gonna do that,
Harold. I've changed.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.115
Freedom, huh?

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.791
80/20, 'cause I like you.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.560
You got an underdog thing
going on, Harold.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.956
Reminds me of the Haitians.

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.751
- What is that?
- It's an injectable microchip.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.838
- I need to keep track of you.
- I won't run again.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.270
I promise I won't run again.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.511
Harold, I can't
take the chance.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.590
Ahh! I don't like needles!

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.716
It's gonna be okay. Look away.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.434
Please, please, please!
No, no, no!

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.797
It's over.
It's over, man. Shit.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.553
Motherfucker!

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.400
Elaine,
this is really fun.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.160
So glad you made that call.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.835
- You called me, Jerry.
- You're right.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.150
Hey, here's a toast.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.710
To Neil Armstrong.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.992
You know, it's been
a great night, Jerry,

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.036
but we should probably start
talking some business,

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.150
don't you think?

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.559
Oh, let's relax, Elaine.
Business isn't going anywhere.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.557
I was thinking maybe
we keep it personal tonight.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.278
Dance till the club closes,

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.360
if you catch my meaning.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.670
You dirty dog.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.398
Okay. All right,
well, let's have a look at it.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.750
What?

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.556
Let's see what
you're working with.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.189
I am catching
your meaning, right?

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.556
I'm not gonna...
I'm not... I'm not.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.673
Go on, Jerry.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.433
Just toss it
against your thigh.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.000
No one's looking.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:40.230
Look, you take that baby out,
and if I like what I see,

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.558
I'll let you
take me home tonight.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.872
But if I don't think
it's up to snuff,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.794
then, well, we start
talking business right now.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.036
What do you say?

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.078
Let me tell you
why you don't need Richard.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.792
This is fantastic,
Mitch. Really impressive.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.160
Well,
it's not my first rodeo.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.796
Oh.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.270
It's Richard.
Get out of the frame.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.120
Don't say a word.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.953
Hey. Hey, Rich. Listen, man,

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.511
extraction's looking iffy.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.717
I don't want
an extraction anymore.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.678
Good. Good, 'cause a deal's
the way to go.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.320
There's not gonna be
a deal, either.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.551
What? What do you mean?

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.030
It seems that while we dropped

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.713
the kidnap
and ransom policy,

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.917
there was another policy
that we overlooked,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.074
corporate life insurance.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.109
Overlooked?

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.152
If Harold were to

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.150
end up dead

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.471
while conducting business
in a foreign country,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.151
this would pay out
$5 million

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.356
to the corporation.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.710
Mmm.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.030
Yeah.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.999
Yeah, well, that's...
That's not a deal I'm willing to do.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.230
Don't start with any of this,

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.874
"I'm not gonna take
anyone out for you!"

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.751
Okay, just relax. Just relax.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.158
And I will give you
one million reasons

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.357
to kill this guy.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.951
Really? One million?

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.190
It's not enough.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.030
What about two million?

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.393
You fucking pig, Mitch!

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.677
<i>Oh, come on,
it's for a good cause.</i>

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.400
<i>Think of someone
other than yourself for once.</i>

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.036
Just wire the money, shithead,
and you have a deal.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.636
Did they double it
to two million?

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.710
They did!

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.151
- Great! Great.
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.115
You're very good at that.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.635
Yeah. What do you say
we hit the town to celebrate?

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.870
Yes! Yes,
we need to celebrate.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.917
<i>- Fiesta!</i>
- Yeah? <i>Fiesta!</i>

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.515
- Join us!
- No, I'm good. I don't dance.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.114
- Come on!
- No, Harold,

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.720
I won't. No, Harold.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.991
No, I don't... I don't dance.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.350
Look.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.712
I'm here to see Mr. Vega.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.877
Hey, gringo,
you're late.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.510
Oh, fuck,
that was too good.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.600
You know,
I really feel like things

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.080
are turning around for me.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.756
- Yeah?
- Thank you, Mitch.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.952
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.755
All right.
Harold, there's something I have to tell you.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.560
Oh...

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.439
Richard's my brother.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.315
Yeah.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.040
Richard Rusk?

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.519
Yep, unfortunately.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.797
- Fuck!
- Ah...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.916
Can't fucking do it!

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.192
Why have you got that out?
What are you doing?

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:09.115
It seems Richard's company
wants to claim

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.520
the insurance policy money.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.114
No, no. No, no, no.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.554
Richard said
they have canceled it!

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.835
They have canceled the policy!

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.039
No, your life insurance
policy, Harold. So...

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.396
- But I thought you liked me.
- I do like you.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.914
No, no, no. But you said

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.520
you liked my whole
underdog thing.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.751
- I love your underdog thing.
- Mitch, please.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.718
Look, I made a deal
with Richard,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.757
that if I sacrificed you,

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.952
- I can help...
- You want to sacrifice me?

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.470
- ...thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of underdogs.
- You want to sacrifice me.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.636
Hey!

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.473
You understand? Harold...

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.159
Oh! Lord Almighty!

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.240
Harold. Shit.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.960
Dear Lord. Please, God,
save me from this man.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.272
Please, I beg you.
Help me in my moment of need.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.874
Please, Jesus. Please.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.111
Harold, nobody's coming
in your moment of need.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.239
You really believe in God?

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.196
Of course, I believe in God.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.794
What kind of person
does not believe in God?

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.315
Me! I... I don't.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.354
Well, I mean,
I guess I kinda do,

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.156
but not in a life or death
situation, Harold.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.359
You know,
I'm looking for something,

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.630
but something more...

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.469
More reliable, you know?

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.233
Yeah, I mean, sure,
I tried reading the Bible

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.913
a couple of times, but...

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.074
I mean,
the Old Testament, Harold.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.879
You can't take
that shit seriously.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.073
And the New Testament,
I mean...

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.797
You take the Bible seriously?

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.073
- Of course.
- Really?

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.637
Like the whole thing
with Peter and Judas.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.238
Remember? So Peter
denies Jesus three times.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.472
Three fucking times, man!

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.910
Now, Judas,
on the other hand,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.719
yeah, I mean,
he fucked up.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.598
He sold Jesus out,
all right?

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.275
But he felt bad about it.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.350
He hung himself, man!
He felt guilty!

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.194
He had a lot more
fucking character

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.471
than fucking Peter.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.475
I mean, Peter.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.914
How do you get
behind a religion

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.037
that demonizes
a guy like Judas

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.794
and makes a saint
out of a guy like Peter?

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.509
Well,

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.112
one was a man
who had a crisis of faith.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.999
The other one sold his soul
for his own gain.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.314
So you have to ask yourself,
which one are you?

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.390
Well...

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.670
Excuse me, man.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.154
Okay. Here.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.429
Nelly said it'd be easy.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.151
It is.
Getting out of here isn't.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.030
There's one exit,

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.474
and security
checks everything.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.270
Mate. Mate!

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.953
How the fuck am I supposed
to get out of here?

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.840
It's okay. I have
a little plan. Come on.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.152
Nelly, you fucking bitch.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.074
Ah!

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.354
Come on.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.073
Let's take the sad song
and make it better.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.230
Hello, Harold.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.350
Put this on.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.793
When you get outside,
you go to your car

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.951
and don't look back.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.194
Follow me.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.839
Let's go.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.197
Sunny said
you were fucking DEA.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.310
Mauricio!

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.754
The gates! The gates!

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.189
Where are you?

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.191
What the fuck?

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.193
Angel! What the motherfuck?

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.397
Harold, I need you to be
very calm right now.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.715
You understand me?

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.439
My name is not Angel.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.193
I'm Victor Cruz.
I'm with the DEA.

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.794
I infiltrated Villegas,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.678
and then your buddy Sanchez
showed up,

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.035
so I infiltrated Promethium.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.476
You know, you work
for bad people, Harold.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.110
- You speak English?
- Yes, I speak English!

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.680
Fuck!

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.470
Go, go, go, go!

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.670
What is wrong
with these people?

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.396
On the side! On the side!
He's coming up on the side!

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.152
I don't think
he can survive that.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.110
Hey!

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.110
Harold!

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.436
You okay, buddy?

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.280
Are you okay?

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.478
You saved my life, Harold.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.195
I need your help.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.714
I can't go back home.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.990
There's nothing
for me there. Nothing.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.073
Please. Please.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.474
You know, people disappear
all the time, Harold.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.878
You died here tonight.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.120
You understand me?

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.873
I understand.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.155
This has everything
you'll need

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.872
to bring down Richard Rusk.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.440
Have a great life, Harold.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.751
<i>Babe.</i>

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.910
What the fuck?

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.680
<i>You know,
this was a tough situation,</i>

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.592
but these were very dangerous
people you were dealing with.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.592
And I was so scared.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.753
You did the right thing
here today.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.114
Go!

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.198
- Richard Rusk?
- Yeah.

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.794
I have a warrant
for your arrest.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.075
Give him the ball.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.996
<i>After an intense,
six-month trial</i>

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.309
<i>which saw
long-time business partner</i>

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.274
<i>Elaine Markinson turn state's
evidence against him,</i>

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.238
<i>president of
Promethium Pharmaceuticals,</i>

<i>Richard Rusk,</i>

<i>to the shocking and tragic
tale of Harold Soyinka.</i>

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.319
<i>You know, my dear friend,
Harold, would still be alive.</i>

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.960
<i>I mean, Nigeria,
Chicago, Mexico.</i>

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.635
<i>I'm surprised the guy
lasted as long as he did.</i>

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.360
Richard Rusk!

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.234
Adam Riley!
