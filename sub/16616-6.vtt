00:01.460 --> 00:04.755
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:11.678
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.762 --> 00:14.139
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:18.227
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:23.190
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.775
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:29.905
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.494 --> 00:38.330
<i>We now return to</i> Rational Geographic.

00:38.413 --> 00:42.000
<i>Upon realizing a trip to Africa</i>
<i>would be smelly and gross,</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:44.336
<i>our crew decided to stay in the office.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.345
Mom! Dad! A bat! A bat!

00:53.428 --> 00:55.097
Oh, my God! There's a bat in the house!

00:55.180 --> 00:58.684
Okay, all right. Everybody just calm down.
It might just be Grandpa Munster.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.435
Somebody set him up for a funny joke.

01:00.519 --> 01:04.231
Hey, Grandpa, how did you
sleep last night?

01:04.648 --> 01:06.108
Yeah, see, if it was him,
he would have said,

01:06.191 --> 01:08.360
"Like I do every night, upside down."

01:10.445 --> 01:13.448
Okay. But, Peter, we can't have
a bat flying around the house,

01:13.532 --> 01:15.075
we got to do something.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.786
Don't worry, Lois, I'll get rid of it.
It'll be a piece of cake.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.788
Just like my penis enhancement.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.874
I want it to hang down to my knees.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.210
They moved up my knees.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.634
Everybody, I've come up with
the perfect plan to catch the bat.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.095
I bought this remote control
toy helicopter

01:35.179 --> 01:36.889
to which I've attached this handgun.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.308
And I tell you, this thing is not
easy to fly.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.268
- Peter, that doesn't seem very...
- Here it goes.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.645
Now I don't have anything
to control the trigger with,

01:43.729 --> 01:45.063
so I put it on a timer.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.857
I don't remember how long I set it...

01:46.940 --> 01:48.442
Ah! We're all gonna die.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.781
Okay, so now the bat has a gun
and the knives I gave him.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.617
What? Why would you give it knives?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.826
I didn't think it would matter,

01:57.910 --> 01:59.912
I was counting on this
helicopter thing working.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.336
Peter, where are you? What's going on?

02:07.419 --> 02:12.341
In order to understand the bat,
we must first understand the vampire.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.927
So I watched <i>Interview with the Vampire.</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:18.430
Cast your gaze upon Lestat.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.475
- Peter, you're not a vampire.
- Oh?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.395
Then why am I clad in velvet pants
tucked into soft leather boots?

02:25.479 --> 02:29.191
And why does my shirt bellow so
in the wind of that rotating fan?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.859
Peter, what's really going on?

02:30.943 --> 02:34.530
I'm just trying to reinvent my look.
A guy at work said I dress like crap.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.823
Well, you show him tomorrow, Peter.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.201
How'd it go?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.286
I was sent home early
and labeled a distraction.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.288
They're having a meeting
about me tomorrow.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.839
Wha... What's wrong?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.091
Are we taking a terrible 7:00 a.m. flight?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.219
No, no. I realized, to catch a bat,
I need to live like a bat.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.347
So I got to be up at night.
It's a nocturnal mission, Lois.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.349
Okay, but what are you gonna do?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.894
Well, as everyone knows, bats watch
a ton of Cinemax soft-core porn,

03:05.978 --> 03:07.813
so that seems like the place to start.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.901
- Aha!

03:12.985 --> 03:14.903
<i>Welcome back to CNBC's</i> Money Line.

03:14.987 --> 03:18.657
Oh, come on, man. Nobody's buying that.
You expect me to believe you own stocks?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.577
<i>Bat Industries was up $2 a share</i>
<i>today in heavy trading.</i>

03:21.660 --> 03:22.744
Huh?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.621
- Get back here! Damn it!

03:25.664 --> 03:26.707
God!

03:48.604 --> 03:51.064
I got you now, Bat Damon.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.649
I named you Bat Damon.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.110
Aw, now I want you to live.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.113
Oh! Oh! What is it?

03:58.197 --> 03:59.198
Ah!

03:59.281 --> 04:00.282
Ow!

04:01.867 --> 04:04.536
You can beat me, but I am who I am.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.289
Peter, what the hell
did you do to Stewie's hand?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.665
It could be broken.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.958
I didn't mean to.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.586
It's just, sometimes,
I don't think before I act.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.088
Oh, hey! High five!

04:15.672 --> 04:18.091
Hey! Did you just high five that sign?

04:18.175 --> 04:21.512
- Yeah.
- You think differently. Get in.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.975
<i>His name was Derek,</i>

04:27.059 --> 04:29.603
<i>but he went by "The Prophet"</i>
<i>when times were good,</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:32.356
<i>or "The Law Giver" when times were bad.</i>

04:32.439 --> 04:33.774
<i>I moved on to his prayer farm</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:36.485
<i>with 45 other members</i>
<i>of the Salvation Star Boys</i>

04:36.568 --> 04:38.570
<i>who died in a mass suicide.</i>

04:38.654 --> 04:40.948
<i>But not me, 'cause I don't like root beer.</i>

04:41.031 --> 04:42.699
<i>And I only drink what I like.</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.827
<i>After it was all over,</i>
<i>I called Lois to pick me up.</i>

04:45.911 --> 04:46.995
<i>She was mad.</i>

04:47.079 --> 04:49.957
<i>But she's what Derek calls</i>
<i>"an oppressing doubter."</i>

04:50.207 --> 04:53.210
<i>May the light of Derek's invincible</i>
<i>diamond shine through you.</i>

04:57.714 --> 05:00.759
Oh, thank you so much
for coming in early, Dr. Hartman.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.845
Oh, no problem. Hell, I used to work here.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.096
- What?
- Good news.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.681
Stewie's hand looks fine.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
- Oh, hey! High five.
- Huh.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.270
As long as you're here, I see Stewie
hasn't had his vaccinations yet.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.772
- Should we take care of that?
- Well, I suppose so.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.066
But first, I'm required
to have you read this pamphlet

05:16.149 --> 05:17.776
about the risks of vaccinations.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.699
God, you're aging so rapidly.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.160
Possible side effects.
Fever, severe allergic reaction,

05:27.244 --> 05:30.205
muscle, and joint pain?
Wait, this can't be right.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.083
They actually put some
of the disease in the shot?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.210
Hey, man.
How many questions your lady ask?

05:35.294 --> 05:36.503
Uh, like a million.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.338
I don't remember having
to read any of this

05:38.422 --> 05:40.716
when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.719
Well, that was before Internet chat
rooms made everybody an expert.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.095
It's a better world now.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.514
I don't know about this, Dr. Hartman.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.933
We might need a little bit
of time to think this over.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.643
Yeah, 'cause we don't wanna
make a big mistake.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.979
Like when I peed next to the chatty guy.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.941
Hey, man. We should get out of here.
The building's on fire.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.735
Hey, pal. Not now. I'm busy.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.613
Anyway, I'll tell you what's on fire.
My urethra.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.657
That's the last time I go to a water park,
I'll tell you that much.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.075
Well, that's not completely true

06:07.159 --> 06:09.411
'cause I have a Groupon
and I'd hate to waste it.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.662
Plus the truth is the kids...

06:11.622 --> 06:14.750
Oh, my God. I was the chatty guy.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.715
Hey, you guys. Is that my laptop?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.800
Yeah, sorry.
We were looking something up.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.761
We were gonna get Stewie vaccinated,

06:25.844 --> 06:28.722
but now, after our research,
we're definitely not.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.017
Oh, now, Lois. Don't tell me you
fell for all that anti-vaxxer crap.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.020
It's not crap, Brian.
There's a lot of evidence to suggest

06:35.103 --> 06:37.856
there's a link
between vaccinations and autism.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.567
Lois, all that so-called evidence
has been debunked.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.152
Listen to some of these ingredients.

06:42.236 --> 06:46.240
Mercury, thimerosal,
aluminum, formaldehyde.

06:46.323 --> 06:49.660
Lois, deciding not to vaccinate Stewie
is something that affects all of us.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.454
The only reason they work
is that if a critical mass of society

06:52.538 --> 06:54.748
gets immunized,
then the diseases won't spread.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.793
Look, Brian, I was skeptical too,
but then I did some research.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.795
And I found some very interesting things

06:59.878 --> 07:01.839
from the leader
of the anti-vaccination movement,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.215
Jenny McCarthy.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.805
See. Proof.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.932
Hard to argue with that.
And look at this one.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.103
Glasses. Case closed.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.980
I can't believe you guys.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.108
Don't you realize you're contributing
to a potential public health disaster

07:21.191 --> 07:22.860
by not vaccinating your child?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.613
That's exactly the point.
My child. He's my child.

07:26.697 --> 07:29.157
And nothing matters
more than his well-being.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.160
Oh, God. This is gonna be
a Lois story, isn't it?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.371
<i>Game of Thrones</i> is on. Just a reminder.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.206
Yeah, we made this mistake before.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.418
We got the other kids vaccinated,
but Meg's still got chicken pox.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.421
- Dad, this is acne.
- Girl, you nasty.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.424
You realize the vast majority
of people think that you're wrong.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.886
Well, maybe that's the problem.
We just got to change their minds.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.181
We're getting this town to change
its mind about vaccinations.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.432
Yeah, I'm with you.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.436
Just as soon as I finish getting the word
out about the one thing more important.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.231
The brothers who made <i>The Matrix</i>
are ladies now! They're ladies!

08:01.315 --> 08:02.983
- Just one of them?
- That's the thing!

08:03.066 --> 08:06.653
It's both of them! What are the chances?
What are the chances?

08:06.737 --> 08:09.448
The brothers who made
<i>The Matrix</i> are ladies now!

08:16.121 --> 08:17.372
All right. Come on, Peter.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.292
I've got all the stuff
for our anti-vaccination rally.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.376
I don't believe this.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.295
It's bad enough you guys
aren't vaccinating Stewie.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.215
Now, you're trying to convince other
people to make the same reckless choice?

08:26.298 --> 08:28.717
I'm also gonna pat
a bunch of dogs without asking.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.010
Don't do that. We don't like that.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.929
Then I'm gonna try and look
at their teeth.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.765
Brian, all we want
is for parents to have the choice.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.559
Because parents know
what's best for their kids.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.103
I hear Sansa finally shows
boob in this one.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.399
You do realize they're
putting your life in danger

08:44.483 --> 08:45.776
by not getting you immunized.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.654
You could get measles, mumps,
rubella, whooping cough.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.073
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?
- Very serious.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.952
Even the tiniest germ could make you
very ill and left untreated kill you.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.747
Really? I'd expect this kind of thing
from the fat man, but not Lois.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.290
Although, she did act like a nut case

09:00.374 --> 09:02.751
that time she went shopping
right before Thanksgiving.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.878
Ready for Turkey Day?

09:04.962 --> 09:08.173
-Clever.
- Don't eat too much turkey tomorrow.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.384
Oh, I won't.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.011
Now if only the meal
would cook itself, huh?

09:18.600 --> 09:22.437
<i>Parents of Quahog and weekend dads</i>
<i>playing three minutes of catch.</i>

09:22.521 --> 09:24.940
<i>Do you know that the number</i>
<i>of childhood vaccines</i>

09:25.023 --> 09:26.900
<i>has tripled in the last generation?</i>

09:26.984 --> 09:28.235
<i>And why is that?</i>

09:28.318 --> 09:31.446
<i>Because heartless corporations</i>
<i>make billions of dollars</i>

09:31.530 --> 09:34.783
<i>by hoisting garbage</i>
<i>and poison upon our children.</i>

09:39.830 --> 09:43.959
<i>We demand that these vaccines</i>
<i>be tested by independent researchers,</i>

09:44.042 --> 09:46.253
<i>not by the companies who make them.</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:48.547
Excuse me, are you the lady
selling the bullhorn?

09:48.630 --> 09:49.798
What? No.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.383
I'm over here!

09:52.134 --> 09:55.554
Damn it!
This doesn't seem to be working.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.015
Well, obviously, Lois.
You can't just go to a park

09:58.098 --> 10:01.143
and list a bunch of boring facts.
You got to spice things up.

10:01.226 --> 10:04.605
Like I did when I was a lounge singer
with uneven lyric density.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.900
This is a song I wrote
for my beautiful girlfriend.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.151
Her name is...

10:09.234 --> 10:10.819
<i>Kim</i>

10:10.903 --> 10:15.616
<i>I don't understand why your father</i>
<i>had such problems with us, Kim</i>

10:15.699 --> 10:18.619
<i>Mostly I think it's because I don't</i>
<i>make my car payments on time</i>

10:18.702 --> 10:22.706
<i>But also because I was dating someone</i>
<i>else at the same time as Kim</i>

10:22.789 --> 10:25.542
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.668
<i>Kim</i>

10:26.752 --> 10:28.670
<i>I love you</i>

10:28.754 --> 10:31.757
<i>But mostly I love that you let me</i>
<i>eat crackers in the bed</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:34.176
<i>Kim</i>

10:34.259 --> 10:35.427
Thank you!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.369
- Yeah, that's enough of that.
- What the hell?

11:00.452 --> 11:02.037
Peter, is that you on TV right now?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.623
Oh, yeah. That's my anti-vaccination PSA.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.625
<i>Hi. I'm a medical guy.</i>

11:06.708 --> 11:10.212
<i>And I'm here to give you</i>
<i>the facts about vax.</i>

11:10.629 --> 11:14.383
Fact! Vaccinations cause autism,
paralysis,

11:14.466 --> 11:18.095
and even death, death, death, death...

11:18.303 --> 11:21.390
Fact! Vaccinate rhymes
with masturbate.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.976
Would you let a doctor do
that to your kid?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.227
Fact!

11:25.310 --> 11:27.813
I still think Michelle Williams
is Carey Mulligan.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.731
Fact!

11:29.815 --> 11:32.526
Medical delivery for bad ass
karate doctor.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.903
Oh, yes, those must be
the bones and skulls.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.449
I see no boob bones. The victim was a man.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.534
Wow!

11:40.951 --> 11:43.036
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

11:43.203 --> 11:46.415
<i>Say no to vaccines.</i>
<i>Paid for with Meg's college fund.</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:55.257
What the hell is all this?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.426
I'm trying to protect myself
from all those diseases

11:57.509 --> 11:59.052
I'm not vaccinated against.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.846
Speaking of which, do you have any idea

12:00.929 --> 12:03.265
the germs you routinely
track into this house?

12:03.348 --> 12:06.435
From now on, I'm going to ask that
you wear these shoes while indoors.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.812
- Where did you get those?
- Put them on and lick your lips!

12:08.896 --> 12:10.689
Stewie, you might be taking this too far.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.025
Proper hygiene depends
on everyone, Brian.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.569
For instance, I've already
saran-wrapped Chris.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.030
I'm a gas station sandwich.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.451
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>with breaking news.</i>

12:22.534 --> 12:26.496
<i>Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog</i>
<i>have dropped to an all-time low,</i>

12:26.580 --> 12:30.584
<i>fueled by a recent media campaign</i>
<i>led by local meddler, Peter Griffin,</i>

12:30.667 --> 12:33.504
<i>shown here in the basket</i>
<i>of Henry Thomas' bicycle.</i>

12:34.296 --> 12:35.756
<i>That can't be real, right?</i>

12:36.715 --> 12:38.967
Oh, I knew one of these
had to be my house.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.969
Damn it, Peter. Thanks to you,
nobody in this town

12:41.053 --> 12:43.013
is vaccinating their kids anymore.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.932
Do you even realize
the harm you've caused?

12:45.015 --> 12:48.060
Harm? What are you talking about?
I'm making the world a better place.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.103
Like when I was the Instagram police.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.149
Sorry, lady, got to crop the chach.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.946
I will take this.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.074
And cutaway complete.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.500
Man, there is a lot of bad art
in these hallways.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.086
All right, Stewie, see you after school.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.713
Wait a minute, where are all
the other kids?

13:16.797 --> 13:19.132
Haven't you heard?
There's been an outbreak of measles.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.969
It's because everyone stopped
vaccinating their kids.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.178
Oh, my God.

13:23.262 --> 13:26.265
And it's not just our school.
Kids all over town are getting sick.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.017
- <i>Attention! Attention!</i>

13:29.101 --> 13:30.227
What the hell?

13:35.566 --> 13:38.902
<i>People of Quahog!</i>
<i>Your town is under quarantine.</i>

13:38.986 --> 13:42.823
<i>Until further notice, no one</i>
<i>may enter or leave the city.</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:45.951
Oh. That's the guy who bought
the bullhorn at the park.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.871
This is awful. It's all our fault.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.999
And look. Joe's arguing with
the state policeman over jurisdiction.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.711
Thanks, Swanson, we'll take it from here.
It's a state matter now.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.713
No way. This is my town.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.590
Thanks, guys,
the feds will take it from here.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.050
Oh, no. This is my state.

14:02.134 --> 14:06.555
Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk,
so I've jurisdiction over all of you.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.474
Must be serious.
They brought in the big guns.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.358
You happy now, Lois?

14:18.442 --> 14:20.068
Because of you,
there's a measles epidemic,

14:20.152 --> 14:21.820
and the whole town is quarantined.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.238
Speak for yourself, Brian.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.408
I, for one, am enjoying
the indoor family time.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.286
Who's up for another game of
Hot Breath Telephone?

14:31.163 --> 14:32.831
We're all gonna die!

14:32.915 --> 14:35.083
Chris, you're supposed to whisper
that to the next person.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.086
Peter, Brian's right.
We were wrong about everything.

14:38.170 --> 14:41.173
We've got to get to the hospital
and get Stewie vaccinated.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.799
It might be a little too late for that.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.302
I kind of destroyed all the vaccines
in town.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.078
All right, what else did I have
to do today?

15:11.161 --> 15:13.956
Oh, yes. Overdose in my apartment.
I better get home.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.750
You destroyed all the vaccines?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.961
Yeah, but it is fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.548
Is anyone else feeling feverish, achy,
and acutely sensitive to light?

15:22.631 --> 15:25.467
Oh, my God, Peter. You've got measles.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.970
Now, hold on, hold on.
Before we all freak out...

15:28.053 --> 15:29.763
It might just be full body herpes.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.474
Wait, you guys.
Dad might not have been vaccinated.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.560
Didn't grandma say he was born in Mexico?

15:34.643 --> 15:35.894
Nobody remembers that, Meg.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.689
We got to keep you away from Stewie.
You'll get him sick.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.649
Oh, my little guy's gonna be fine.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.319
All he needs is a good old fashioned
game of Hot Breath Telephone.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.154
-Measles.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.239
I've got to get out of this house

15:47.322 --> 15:49.575
or I'll be in worse shape
than John Goodman.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.578
- I've got your EKG here.
- How does it look?

15:52.661 --> 15:56.957
- Well, it spells out pancakes.
- Oh. Okay. So, same as last time.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.043
I'm recommending you go
on a strict diet immediately.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.463
Nope. Horses that make it look
like I can walk,

16:03.547 --> 16:05.382
take me to Hollywood.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.018
All right, I'm almost done packing.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.437
I got it down to four bags and a hat box.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.939
I'm gonna need some help, Rupert.
Rupert?

16:21.940 --> 16:24.109
Ew. That's the tushie thermometer.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.529
Dear God, you're burning up.
I have to get out of here.

16:29.573 --> 16:33.035
I'm sorry, Rupert. But the situation here
has become unbearable.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.454
Like talking to someone with adult braces.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.498
So, yeah, last weekend Sheila
and I took the kids up to the lake,

16:38.582 --> 16:42.127
it was great. We had great weather,
we fired up the barbecue,

16:42.211 --> 16:43.879
Sheila's parents came up
towards the end of the...

16:43.962 --> 16:45.797
When are you gonna get those off?

16:50.886 --> 16:53.931
Meg, you must carry on my legacy.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.142
Promise me, you'll crop the chaches.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.937
Crop them, Meg. Crop them all.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.315
Peter! Stewie's gone!
I've looked everywhere!

17:03.398 --> 17:05.859
Oh, Lois. I'm feeling a little better.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.986
I think I could keep down deviled eggs.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.071
Lois, what's wrong?

17:09.154 --> 17:12.032
I can't find Stewie.
He must have gotten out of the house.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.159
God knows how far he's gone.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.621
Well, look.
There's a family circus dotted path.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.956
It'll lead us right to him.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.171
Oh, it's just Billy. He died of measles.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.174
And here come Marmaduke
to lick up the vomit.

17:30.509 --> 17:31.510
Lucky.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.976
If I can just escape this quarantine
and make it to the next town,

17:39.059 --> 17:40.936
I'll be able to get that vaccine I need.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.064
Stewie, I'm you from the future.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.316
You've got to get the hell out of town
before you get sick.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.277
Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.654
Okay, I'm really here
because I know you have glue.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.989
Give me the glue.

17:54.408 --> 17:55.409
Oh.

17:56.118 --> 18:00.455
Stewie, listen to me.
Never ever do this great thing I love.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.132
There's the bridge out of town.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.305
So, we're all there at The Clam,
just kinda making music together,

18:16.388 --> 18:19.975
and then Peter, of course,
had to join in and clap his hands,

18:20.058 --> 18:23.270
and I said, "That's enough of that!"

18:23.353 --> 18:25.022
Yeah, I kinda run the group.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.233
I'll just have to go around them.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.326
Good lord!

18:37.409 --> 18:40.704
I hope my shoe doesn't fall to
make me realize how far the drop is.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.753
Oh. My orthotic was in there.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.257
- Stewie!
- Where are you?

18:52.716 --> 18:54.343
Lois, what's going on?

18:54.426 --> 18:56.053
That's one of my sidekick's wives.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.263
He says he's in charge of the group.
Is that true?

18:58.347 --> 19:01.308
No, not in the slightest.
But, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.893
We can't find him anywhere.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.436
Lois, look!

19:07.856 --> 19:09.525
I don't know if he can hold on
much longer.

19:09.608 --> 19:10.651
We got to get him down.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.945
Stewie, hang on! Mommy's coming.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.659
Oh, no! Upside down train!

19:22.204 --> 19:23.455
- Stewie!
- Oh, no!

19:28.836 --> 19:30.045
Sean Penn?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.714
That's right.
Two-time Oscar winner, Sean Penn.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.882
What are you doing here?

19:33.966 --> 19:36.260
I'm bringing vaccines
into your quarantined town.

19:36.343 --> 19:40.013
Any time there's a public health crisis
in the third world land, I'm there.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.890
Third world? This is Rhode Island.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.893
Oh, really? Have you seen
some of the delis on Federal Hill?

19:44.977 --> 19:47.479
Rhode Island slam!

19:47.563 --> 19:49.565
I like you, Sean Penn.

19:51.525 --> 19:52.568
Oh, my God.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.571
You saved my baby. Thank you so mu...

19:56.029 --> 19:57.990
Oh. Sean Penn.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.909
You're the one who played
that homosexual?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.578
- Yeah.
- All right, well,

20:02.661 --> 20:04.037
I'll take my son now.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.290
I've brought enough vaccines
for your whole town.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.374
I hope you've realized

20:07.457 --> 20:09.877
that vaccinations are not
a freedom of choice issue,

20:09.960 --> 20:11.295
they're a public health issue.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.630
Thanks to them,
countless serious diseases,

20:13.714 --> 20:17.593
mumps, polio, small pox, and rubella
have been all but eradicated.

20:17.676 --> 20:22.014
Like clean water and functional schools,
vaccinations are a human right.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.934
Great. Just what I needed.
A lecture from liberal Hollywood.

20:26.018 --> 20:29.188
This whole thing has been
a lecture from liberal Hollywood.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.694
Well, it's a relief
that everyone's been vaccinated

20:35.777 --> 20:37.279
and the quarantine has been lifted.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.450
I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy
and only 150 people died,

20:41.533 --> 20:43.076
but not anyone we knew personally.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.621
Yeah, I know I sure learned something.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.790
Hey, do you like apples?

20:48.874 --> 20:49.875
Yeah.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.753
Well, I got her number.
How do you like them apples?

20:52.836 --> 20:55.964
Oh, Bat Damon!
You got the best of me again!
