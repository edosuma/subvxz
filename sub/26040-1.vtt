01:24.459 --> 01:34.469
A GENTLE CREATURE

03:23.995 --> 03:26.373
Why are you sitting like this?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.210
Why are you so sad?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.083
I'm talking to you!
Wake up!

05:35.460 --> 05:36.503
Your ID.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.431
Everybody knows.
Everybody understands.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.393
If a war starts, then what?
One nuclear missile...

05:51.518 --> 05:54.062
You think Russians can't aim?

05:54.187 --> 05:59.025
There are many ways
to blow up America with a single missile.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.531
- One nuclear missile, dammit!
- What else is there to say?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.494
Youngsters always
jump the queue.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.455
I need to get my pension.
I want to eat.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.999
Two hundred rubles.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.166
What for?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.043
It's "return to sender".

06:17.168 --> 06:18.461
Why has it been returned?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.464
- Put it over there.
- Doesn't it say anything?

06:22.257 --> 06:24.175
The reason is not specified.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.802
What does that mean?

06:25.927 --> 06:28.013
I don't know.
Where did you send it?

06:29.139 --> 06:31.099
Excuse me.
Do you have any blank forms?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.475
- On the table.
- Thank you.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.269
To a prison?

06:36.938 --> 06:39.107
Sign here.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.359
Doesn't it say anything else?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.071
Are you going to pay?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.490
Or should I take it back?

06:49.492 --> 06:52.537
- Can I collect a parcel?
- There's a queue, young man.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.333
Be patient!

06:57.042 --> 07:00.337
Why has it been returned?
Usually, there are no problems.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.842
Please check.
Isn't there a note?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.138
Maybe it's possible to find out?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.809
Sign here.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.529
Come this way,
I'll give it to you over there.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.330
Maybe there were
some papers attached?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.792
Papers? This is a post office,
not prison information!

07:38.917 --> 07:41.086
Please tell me
who I should contact!

07:42.545 --> 07:43.588
Your husband?

07:46.257 --> 07:47.425
Your son?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.136
Your father, then?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.388
Leave her alone.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.348
Father or no father,
what's it to you?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.935
I'm only trying to help.
Can't you see she is confused?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.646
How can you help her?
Get away from her.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.564
She doesn't want to talk to you.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.358
I'll spit in your face.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.444
I'll cough up some TB on you!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.530
Don't you dare.
Get lost!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.952
Our Zinka. The one who lives
in the blue house.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.163
On the corner of Lenin
and Engels Streets.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.874
They dug up an arm or something
in that area,

09:43.333 --> 09:45.376
and that's where he spotted her.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.004
Which Zinka?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.215
There's only one Zinka round here.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.844
At first they hid the body.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.596
Yes...

09:57.222 --> 10:00.183
I told you!
She knows everything.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.727
Then they went back
and chopped up the body.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.605
With the very same chainsaw
he gave him.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.233
The same chainsaw
they used to cut her up.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.486
Then they buried the parts in the forest,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.697
so the police took a week
to find all the pieces.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.533
Some here, some there.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.785
I wondered why they...

10:19.452 --> 10:21.538
It turns out, that's why.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.750
- They dug it out of the snow?
- No, it was summer.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.169
What am I,
a shelf for your parcel?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.380
Hold your box properly, lady.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.674
Stop putting it on my feet!

10:32.799 --> 10:35.343
I'm wearing stockings, you know.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.137
Get your box off me!

10:37.262 --> 10:39.931
Where should she move it?
There's people here, too!

10:40.056 --> 10:42.392
We have legs, too. Quit moaning!

10:42.517 --> 10:44.185
Mind your own business!

10:44.310 --> 10:46.771
It's not the same.
You're wearing pants.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.731
Pants or no pants,
I still have legs.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.900
They know the bus is packed

10:51.025 --> 10:53.611
and they push inside with their boxes!

10:54.195 --> 10:57.157
They ferry boxes all over the place.

10:57.282 --> 11:01.786
Here, there and back,
boxes all the way!

11:01.911 --> 11:04.873
One time it was a coffin...

11:04.998 --> 11:07.417
The whole bus helped to hold it.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.336
They held it high, over their heads.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.796
What choice did they have?

11:11.921 --> 11:14.757
A man died. He must be buried.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.759
His relatives could pay
for a coffin,

11:16.885 --> 11:19.012
but not for transportation.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.930
So they had to take it on the bus.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.766
Who would object?
Nobody.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.685
We're all going to die.

11:27.353 --> 11:33.067
So, your coffin, clear lady,
will be carried in the same manner.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
Shut up, old lady!

11:35.320 --> 11:37.530
Why?
You think you're immortal?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.490
We're all going to croak.
Even you.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.453
And you won't need your stockings, then.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.414
Just my luck...

11:46.539 --> 11:51.002
Every time I get on a bus,
there's always some idiot riding with me!

11:51.461 --> 11:54.088
Who won't shut up!

11:54.214 --> 11:56.758
Now she doesn't like my stockings.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.427
Know where you can shove
my stockings?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.305
I had a pal about 20 years ago.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.226
One night we ride the bus home.
The next day he doesn't turn up.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.728
What happened?
He died overnight.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.979
Just like that.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.441
The detective kept coming.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.070
They'd dug everything up
and ID'd the body.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.781
But he kept coming back.

12:19.906 --> 12:24.285
So the people started wondering,
why is he still hanging around?

12:26.162 --> 12:30.083
He wasn't getting anywhere.
Just kept coming and going.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.334
So?

12:31.459 --> 12:34.170
So I'm telling you.
He was visiting Zinka.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.548
While looking for the corpse,
he had his eye on Zinka.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.218
- And?
- Our Zinka.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.763
The one in the blue house,
at the corner of Lenin and Engels.

12:43.888 --> 12:48.351
They dug up an arm or something
and he chatted her up...

16:49.383 --> 16:52.762
I've been looking out for you!
I wasn't sure that was you.

16:53.638 --> 16:57.934
My nephew is here.
I filled his tank from our extra supply.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.103
It's too far to walk.
The roads are bad.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.980
- Say hello.
- Hi.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.694
If Petrovich drops by,
tell him that the pump is leaking.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.989
I told him already,
but he didn't fix it.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.869
Oh Well...

17:18.746 --> 17:23.584
There's water, tea and sugar.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.378
And there's some bread left.
Help yourself.

17:26.837 --> 17:27.922
Well...

17:29.674 --> 17:32.426
The lock is on the nail,
the key is in the lock.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.679
I'm off, over to you.

17:36.806 --> 17:41.602
You won't be bored tonight,
you've got company.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.565
What's worth guarding
in your house?

17:45.690 --> 17:48.484
Can you replace me next week?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.028
Something happened?

17:52.321 --> 17:55.157
They granted me a visit.
I need a couple of days.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.122
This is sacred.
You'll see your man.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.873
You're withering away,
here alone.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.377
Be quiet!

18:06.502 --> 18:08.045
Is it OK?

18:08.546 --> 18:11.424
So you get to go to town.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.926
You get to see people.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.433
My man never went to prison,

18:20.558 --> 18:23.269
so I never had a chance
to see the world.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.815
Oh God...
Son of a bitch!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.901
I hope they put him in prison one day.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.737
Can you cover for me?

18:32.862 --> 18:33.904
Well...

18:35.740 --> 18:38.784
You stay here all clay long,
not a single car.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.955
Nobody to talk to.
What are we guarding here?

18:43.623 --> 18:48.586
There was just one car today.
A foreigner. Spoke no Russian.

18:48.711 --> 18:54.383
I say this, I say that,
all he can say is "bla-bla-bla".

18:55.134 --> 18:58.512
And you're going to town!
You're going to see people!

18:58.638 --> 19:02.350
We're stuck here with the radio,
nothing but "bla-bla-bla".

19:02.475 --> 19:04.393
So? Is it OK then?

19:05.269 --> 19:08.314
I have to go.
He's waiting for me.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.857
What's your answer?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.195
My answer, my answer...

19:15.071 --> 19:16.781
Bring us a treat.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.076
Not for me. I need nothing.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.703
Something for my nephew.
He's got a sweet tooth.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.665
I'll leave the dog here.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.500
Look after the house.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.586
You've got nothing to steal!

19:32.797 --> 19:34.590
Off we go!

20:30.479 --> 20:32.356
Step through.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.619
Through the metal detector.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.872
Hurry UP-

21:02.261 --> 21:04.013
Step on through.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.057
Keys, phones and weapons on the table!
Keep it moving.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.560
And the weapon between my legs?
On the table, too?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.771
There's always castration.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.106
It's not castration,
it's circumcision!

21:14.231 --> 21:16.734
- Over here, with your bag.
- Move on.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.861
For kids?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.863
Yes, kids' stuff, and mine.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.998
Move on.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.419
What have you got in here?

21:36.545 --> 21:37.880
A box.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.340
What kind of box?

21:39.799 --> 21:40.966
A parcel.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.552
What kind of parcel?

21:43.677 --> 21:45.429
An ordinary parcel.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.473
And what's in the parcel?

21:47.598 --> 21:50.351
Some things, clothes,
canned food.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.852
What canned food?

21:52.478 --> 21:53.771
Canned fish.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.065
I see.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.651
Take your bag and follow me.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.622
- Where are you going?
- Siberia, of course.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.999
- Excellent choice of destination!
- Thanks.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.069
- What's that?
- Condensed milk.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.737
Are you sure?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.365
You can check it.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.825
Want some condensed milk?

22:49.493 --> 22:53.330
Boss, I want
some condensed milk!

22:55.624 --> 22:57.209
Meanie!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.423
Give me some condensed milk!

23:03.507 --> 23:05.426
Put that back.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.887
Put it all back in. Hurry up.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.681
Don't do it!

23:11.557 --> 23:14.518
Girl, give me some condensed milk,
please.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.729
Baby!

23:19.148 --> 23:20.274
Don't be mean!

23:20.399 --> 23:21.483
Stop.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.110
Take your coat off.

23:23.694 --> 23:24.904
Take it off.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.656
Strip her!

23:27.781 --> 23:29.366
Against the wall. Arms up.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.202
Hey red-dress, how do you do?
How about a little screw?

23:33.537 --> 23:35.372
What a pretty girl!

23:36.332 --> 23:37.583
Do you like her?

23:37.708 --> 23:38.959
Turn round.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.045
Touch me!

23:41.837 --> 23:43.339
Touch me up!

23:43.923 --> 23:45.841
Touch me up, boss!

23:48.218 --> 23:50.179
Get dressed and take your stuff.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.476
Why get dressed?
Get undressed!

23:57.353 --> 23:58.812
Get undressed!

24:00.356 --> 24:01.398
Boss...

24:02.358 --> 24:03.692
Undress her!

24:05.361 --> 24:07.154
What's your husband in prison for?

24:08.364 --> 24:10.115
Murder.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.492
Of a cat!

24:11.992 --> 24:14.453
- Who did he kill?
- Give me condensed milk!

24:14.578 --> 24:15.621
Nobody.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.707
- So why is he in prison?
- He killed a cat!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.710
Because he was sentenced.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.129
It can happen to anyone.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.174
You don't go to prison
for nothing, here.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.051
Nonsense.

24:29.677 --> 24:30.970
Yes, you do!

24:31.095 --> 24:32.554
Why am I in prison?

24:33.514 --> 24:36.058
I love women
and I want condensed milk!

24:37.142 --> 24:40.270
Should I go to prison for that?
Because I want milk?

24:40.396 --> 24:45.275
Citizen X was questioned
by Officers Y and Z

24:45.401 --> 24:49.571
on this date, of that year,
at the entrance to N town station,

24:49.697 --> 24:50.948
on suspicion of terrorism.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.409
Citizen X was searched,
nothing found.

24:53.534 --> 24:59.665
Citizen X was then released
to continue her journey to prison X

25:00.207 --> 25:02.918
for the purpose
of visiting her husband.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.842
- Sign and date it.
- Sign nothing!

25:09.967 --> 25:11.010
What is this for?

25:11.468 --> 25:14.221
Rules.
What do you think?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.472
Don't sign!

25:15.597 --> 25:17.558
Sign and you can go.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.144
Say you're illiterate.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.939
Put her in here!

25:25.190 --> 25:27.151
I'll beat the shit out of you, freak!

25:28.027 --> 25:30.154
Easy to pick on a cripple!

25:32.281 --> 25:33.699
Give me milk!

25:33.824 --> 25:37.244
And all the shit fell on our country.
Yanks and fucking Nazis.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.289
- Are you nuts?
- You guys fucked up.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.916
You weren't born,
when I drove a tank.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.251
Know what that means?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.545
It was great.
The whole world in our hand.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.423
Lady, do you know what that means?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.717
Your generation fucked it all up!

25:51.842 --> 25:54.344
What about you?
Do you know about our tanks?

25:55.054 --> 25:58.140
<i>The armour is strong
and our tanks are swift!</i>

25:58.265 --> 25:59.308
There!

25:59.433 --> 26:02.519
<i>And our men are full of courage</i>

26:02.644 --> 26:06.565
<i>The Soviet tankmen are
ready for action</i>

26:06.690 --> 26:10.486
<i>Sons of their Great Motherland!</i>

26:10.611 --> 26:14.448
<i>Thundering with fire,
steel gleaming in the sun</i>

26:14.573 --> 26:18.077
<i>The tanks will launch
a mighty attack!</i>

26:18.202 --> 26:21.789
<i>When we're called to battle
by Comrade Stalin</i>

26:21.914 --> 26:24.500
<i>Voroshilov will lead us all the way!</i>

26:24.625 --> 26:27.544
Exactly! Squash the fuckers.
Our grandfathers weren't dumb!

26:27.669 --> 26:30.923
They knew what they were doing
when they built all that.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.091
That's it.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.594
Drink to that with us, lady!

26:35.719 --> 26:38.806
Let's drink to your son.
May he rest in peace.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.727
To your son, lady!
You must drink to this, it's sacred!

26:47.064 --> 26:48.482
Rest in peace.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.567
May he rest in peace.
To your son.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.578
Well clone, lady.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.048
I got home from work,

27:13.674 --> 27:15.926
and found a note,
saying to go somewhere.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.302
I went.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.683
And they told me:
"here's the address, off you go."

27:23.892 --> 27:26.228
They tell me there's been
a tragedy, a heroic death.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.149
They said I should sign
the papers to get the money.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.403
I couldn't understand it,

27:34.528 --> 27:37.030
but they said
they'd take care of everything.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.617
They said: "go pick it up."

27:41.201 --> 27:42.828
But what?

27:45.038 --> 27:47.082
So I went. What else could I do?

27:49.126 --> 27:52.129
It took me a whole day
to find a replacement.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.090
I had to or they'd fire me.
And then what?

27:56.884 --> 27:59.178
They said that...

28:03.515 --> 28:05.225
"For your dead son,

28:06.643 --> 28:09.229
you'll get a lot of money."

28:10.189 --> 28:12.566
What money?
How will they pay me?

28:13.817 --> 28:14.985
So here I am.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.865
Pick what up?
My son or the money?

28:21.491 --> 28:24.828
So where was he killed?

28:26.914 --> 28:28.081
Lady?

28:29.166 --> 28:32.252
Did they tell you where he was killed?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.596
They didn't tell me where...

28:42.721 --> 28:45.224
The guy was a hero.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.017
- To the hero!
- To the hero!

28:47.601 --> 28:48.810
May he rest in peace.

29:05.619 --> 29:10.249
<i>Over the river Don,
under a large oak</i>

29:10.374 --> 29:14.169
<i>A Cossack woman waved goodbye
to her handsome bloke</i>

29:18.799 --> 29:23.303
<i>A Cossack woman waved goodbye
to her handsome bloke</i>

29:23.428 --> 29:27.808
<i>She waved goodbye by the town
of Rostov, in a field</i>

29:27.933 --> 29:32.479
<i>She embraced her dashing
Cossack in the blowing wind</i>

29:38.568 --> 29:40.570
I grew up in Magadan, Siberia.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.490
We can beat them all!

29:43.615 --> 29:45.575
We will, man, we will.

29:45.701 --> 29:49.121
The whole world is looking at us!
We're doing this for them!

29:49.246 --> 29:50.914
I grew up in Magadan.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.083
So many people died!

29:53.208 --> 29:56.670
We sacrifice everything,
but they are all against us!

29:58.422 --> 29:59.464
Why?

29:59.589 --> 30:02.592
Because they're all
a bunch of assholes, man.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.095
Why should we save them?

30:05.220 --> 30:07.347
It's our mission, to save the world.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.766
That's exactly what I mean!
Mission!

30:10.225 --> 30:13.770
When I was a kid,
there were rockets all over town.

30:13.895 --> 30:17.566
But they let it all go,
and the world got ugly.

30:18.317 --> 30:23.572
So now they are making rockets again,
so no one can push us about.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.033
Do you have your own mug,
my friend?

30:35.709 --> 30:37.669
Let's drink to our great mission!

30:37.794 --> 30:39.796
To our enormous suffering.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.423
- To our guys!
- To our guys!

30:45.177 --> 30:46.470
You want some tea?

30:55.687 --> 30:58.523
- Tea? Tea, anyone?
- Thanks.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.400
- How much?
- 20 rubles.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.027
No, thanks.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.529
Put one glass there!

31:04.654 --> 31:06.114
It's on me, my sweet.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.034
My sweet...

31:11.244 --> 31:12.371
Thank you.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.248
Where are you going?

31:15.749 --> 31:17.334
To visit my husband.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.294
What's he in for?

31:20.295 --> 31:21.338
For nothing.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.508
So what was he sentenced for?

31:25.550 --> 31:26.927
Nothing.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.346
They put him in, he'll get out.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.682
I did 5 years.
I still don't know why.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.559
That's what prison's like.

31:39.606 --> 31:45.028
<i>I remember the port of Vanino</i>

31:46.029 --> 31:51.785
<i>The ominous cry of the steamships</i>

31:52.285 --> 31:57.582
<i>As we climbed a ladder to board</i>

31:58.667 --> 32:03.964
<i>To descend into cold dark holds</i>

32:04.714 --> 32:10.095
<i>The swell tormented us prisoners</i>

32:10.220 --> 32:16.059
<i>As we clung to each other like brothers</i>

32:16.601 --> 32:21.648
<i>And, now and then, bitter curses</i>

32:22.482 --> 32:27.988
<i>Escaped our suffering lips</i>

32:29.239 --> 32:34.786
<i>The mist disappeared by day</i>

32:36.121 --> 32:41.918
<i>The violent storm had subsided</i>

32:42.461 --> 32:48.341
<i>The great Magadan came our way</i>

32:49.468 --> 32:55.474
<i>The heart of the land of Kolyma</i>

32:56.683 --> 33:02.105
<i>I know you're not waiting for me</i>

33:02.981 --> 33:08.904
<i>And you don't even open my letters</i>

33:09.905 --> 33:15.994
<i>You will never come to meet me</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:22.876
<i>And even if you do, you won't know me</i>

34:02.082 --> 34:04.125
Going somewhere?

34:06.628 --> 34:08.838
Go on, go on, give me your bag.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.696
What are you waiting for?
Get in.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.989
I'm the cheapest here.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.500
Where are you going?

35:29.085 --> 35:30.879
Where do you think?

35:31.379 --> 35:34.799
Either a hotel or the prison.
Which do you like better?

35:34.924 --> 35:36.176
I need to go to the prison.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.011
That's what I thought.

35:41.723 --> 35:42.849
Husband?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.560
Father?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.021
Is it your son?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.482
Just someone I know.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.610
I see... Well, well.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.070
It's a date, isn't it?

35:55.654 --> 35:56.863
Something like that.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.119
I've seen a lot of your kind.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.247
Some real stunners!
Sweep you off your feet.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.042
I remember one black girl.
One hot mama!

36:09.167 --> 36:10.794
Great big lips she had.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.671
And everything else, too.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.131
Is this your first time?

36:16.925 --> 36:19.552
You behave like a fresher.
I could tell.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.930
You look at people differently.

36:22.597 --> 36:26.309
Nobody looks you in the eye
here, just the odd glance.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.727
Guess why?

36:27.852 --> 36:30.897
You got it.
Man is a wolf to his fellow man.

36:31.022 --> 36:34.275
And how do wolves live?
In packs. Get it?

36:35.276 --> 36:37.320
Our prison here is
a sacred place.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.948
An icon. It made this town.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.283
What would you do here
without a prison?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.537
It's as precious as gold.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.747
It helps people live.

36:48.289 --> 36:53.002
Some people stay inside,
and others live off it.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.171
You get it?
There.

36:55.672 --> 36:58.007
So here we pray for this prison
to thrive and prosper.

36:58.133 --> 37:01.136
It's our church, so to speak.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.931
People like you come,
I earn a living.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.600
I give you a lift, some food,
here and there,

37:07.726 --> 37:09.477
that's how the economy works.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.646
And what's prison?

37:12.397 --> 37:14.274
It keeps people safe.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.693
People are brainless creatures.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.572
Let them out, they get shot.
End of story.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.407
But in prison it's like
they're in a bank vault.

37:22.907 --> 37:27.078
You do your time, you pay,
you get out. Sign here!

37:27.203 --> 37:29.372
Want to stay longer?
By all means!

37:29.914 --> 37:32.876
You get out,
breathe the air of freedom,

37:33.001 --> 37:35.628
look at the blue sky,
hang out with your mates,

37:35.754 --> 37:37.505
have a great time...

37:38.757 --> 37:40.800
...and then you get low.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.136
Sick with depression.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.221
It's so bad you could choke.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.558
The prison saved so many people.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.479
You can't imagine who's been here.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.189
So your man's lucky.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.774
We've got a great prison.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.819
We'll be there in a sec.

37:59.944 --> 38:03.072
I'll drive you up right there,
like a VIP.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.797
- Where do I go now?
- You walk.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.465
Where to?

38:20.590 --> 38:24.177
I'm not allowed any closer.
I drove you as far as I could.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.013
The office is over there.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.680
Fill out two copies.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.683
They also eat snails
in that shitty France.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.185
Snails squeak when you eat them.
Savages!

39:14.310 --> 39:15.979
- Next!
- Two forms, please.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.313
40 rubles.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.987
And why is your nose all burnt?
Don't you use sunscreen?

39:24.904 --> 39:26.781
Fill out two copies.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.116
Next!

39:28.241 --> 39:30.285
Next!
Can't you talk?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.750
Fill out two copies.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.922
A guy had 3 sons,
2 in prison, one moron.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.259
They pick one
and give him hell.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.761
Next!

39:48.887 --> 39:51.222
If he puts up a fight
they beat him up.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.600
They make threats to tear him
limb from limb

39:53.725 --> 39:57.896
until he looks like
the Union Jack!

39:58.646 --> 40:03.192
Until he remembers the criminal code
and his crimes.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.986
That's how it works...

40:05.111 --> 40:06.154
Next!

40:06.821 --> 40:09.574
So I'm telling you.
This joint is OK.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.994
Parcels get inside,
all nice and legal.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.663
Some say
the army recruits in here.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.833
A reduced sentence in exchange
for combat duty.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.377
It's all lies made up in America.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.047
Who'd agree
to get themselves killed?

40:24.172 --> 40:27.133
That's what I've heard.
I don't know myself.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.553
- It has to be official, right?
- All done in secret.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.723
One day he's a prison inmate,
and the next day,

40:33.848 --> 40:35.892
he's a hero
of the Russian Federation.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.519
He gets a flat, a car, the whole lot.

40:38.645 --> 40:41.731
Serve your motherland,
your motherland covers you.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.524
Hero my ass.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.234
They snuff him out.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.278
Never trust cops, or the army.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.947
Don't sell us this crap.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.449
Did you bring a parcel
or you're just keeping warm?

40:51.574 --> 40:53.034
- It's not allowed.
- Bothering people!

40:53.159 --> 40:56.162
Why isn't it allowed?

40:56.287 --> 40:57.580
I can show you a receipt.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.832
It's Krakow sausage!
Kra-kow.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.960
Can you believe it?

41:02.085 --> 41:04.420
They're not accepting
smoked sausage today!

41:04.545 --> 41:07.298
- Next!
- They make up new rules every day!

41:16.307 --> 41:17.558
Sign here.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.696
Next.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.454
Your papers.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.418
Not allowed.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.295
How come?
It's on the list!

41:47.296 --> 41:48.673
OK, get it out.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.968
Does your husband get
his meat out, too?

41:52.093 --> 41:54.012
Yeah, I doubt
you have a husband...

42:10.862 --> 42:12.196
Not allowed.

42:12.321 --> 42:14.032
What is allowed here?

42:14.157 --> 42:16.325
You don't eat anything
and you don't let others?

42:16.451 --> 42:18.995
- Come on.
- People need to eat.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.256
If I had known,
I'd have brought cheap cigs.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.719
Like the crap you smoke.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.019
How's anyone going
to shave with those?

42:43.936 --> 42:46.564
Take one,
you could slit your wrists.

42:46.689 --> 42:47.774
Shut up.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.901
Don't shut me up!

42:50.026 --> 42:52.904
You didn't open my mouth,
and you can't shut it.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.911
Relax!
What the hell is this mess?

43:04.540 --> 43:06.417
Those were good slippers!

43:08.461 --> 43:11.506
I bet you've never seen
anything like them.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.758
You and your felt boots...

43:13.883 --> 43:14.967
And...

43:17.970 --> 43:20.181
You can have them now.

43:21.474 --> 43:24.102
Take them to your grave.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.563
Something to tart you up in there.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.232
The conversation is over.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.859
It hasn't even started.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.906
I'll see you soon, skank.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.449
Shut your trap.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.742
Next.

43:43.704 --> 43:44.831
Your papers?

44:04.433 --> 44:05.518
Next.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.729
- Why next? What about me?
- Not allowed. Next!

44:08.855 --> 44:13.151
- Why?
- Because I said so.

44:13.276 --> 44:15.528
And don't make a fuss.
Next!

44:15.653 --> 44:17.530
Check the files!
Is my husband here?

44:17.655 --> 44:19.031
Can you tell me where he is?

44:19.157 --> 44:22.702
You need to file an enquiry,
with the appropriate department.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.120
Next!
I'm no information desk.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.831
But why do you refuse my parcel?

44:26.956 --> 44:29.041
I've had enough.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.794
I'm not obliged to do anything!

44:33.004 --> 44:35.965
What was the point of that?
Now we all suffer!

44:36.090 --> 44:38.968
Talk bad to them and they get ratty.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.511
They're already rats.

44:40.636 --> 44:44.015
Don't shout at the woman.
You can see she's upset...

44:44.140 --> 44:45.725
We are all upset!

44:45.850 --> 44:48.519
Don't worry, lady,
it'll be OK.

44:48.978 --> 44:51.689
- The bitch is crabby today, that's all.
- Yes, of course.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.826
I feel sorry anyway...
For all of us.

45:37.318 --> 45:38.569
Do you smoke?

45:39.987 --> 45:41.781
Then I won't either.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.243
So they didn't accept it.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.704
It happens quite often here.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.415
Don't be upset.
You'll come back tomorrow.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.126
Do you have a place to stay?

45:55.419 --> 45:56.754
I don't know, yet.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.549
OK, look here,
there is a hotel in town,

46:01.008 --> 46:05.137
but it's for big fraudsters,
money hustlers.

46:05.263 --> 46:07.098
The ones with dough.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.601
The others rent rooms in town.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.271
My name is Zinka.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.065
I won't charge you much.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.068
I'm doing it for the people,

46:19.193 --> 46:21.779
because I want to help
the likes of you.

46:23.281 --> 46:26.117
People like you suffer so much,
so much...

46:27.326 --> 46:30.079
It breaks my heart.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.624
I have a room for you.

46:34.166 --> 46:37.044
Better than a hen house.
But you'll have to share.

46:37.169 --> 46:38.754
People in the same situation.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.173
Do you think you are unique?

46:43.175 --> 46:46.470
It's small but cosy.
Nothing fancy.

46:46.595 --> 46:47.847
Shall we go?

46:47.972 --> 46:49.181
Let's go!

46:49.307 --> 46:51.225
You must be hungry.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.821
This one's fast,
always gets her prey.

47:05.364 --> 47:06.866
Lots of suckers around.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.789
<i>Alyonka!</i>

47:13.914 --> 47:16.917
<i>She's still soaking
on the platform in the rain</i>

47:17.043 --> 47:18.294
More booze?

47:18.419 --> 47:21.797
<i>Farewell, farewell,
my clear soulmate</i>

47:22.256 --> 47:25.051
<i>I'll never see my love again</i>

47:26.302 --> 47:30.014
<i>The mill of life will grind up everything</i>

47:30.139 --> 47:33.142
<i>That got mixed up in our way</i>

47:34.101 --> 47:37.521
<i>Let tears flow like a fountain</i>

47:38.147 --> 47:41.150
<i>From your lovely big eyes</i>

47:41.901 --> 47:45.654
<i>My dear friend is now out of here</i>

47:45.780 --> 47:47.990
<i>She goes back to normal life</i>

47:48.115 --> 47:52.078
<i>And the freedom,
and the freedom tastes so good</i>

47:52.203 --> 47:55.623
<i>Mum and Dad, I don't doubt,
wait for you</i>

47:56.415 --> 47:59.627
<i>And your darling baby sister...</i>

47:59.752 --> 48:01.587
<i>Alyonka!</i>

48:01.712 --> 48:05.216
<i>She's still soaking
on the platform in the rain</i>

48:06.342 --> 48:10.054
<i>Farewell, farewell,
our paths are parting</i>

48:10.179 --> 48:13.057
<i>And our fate is split in two</i>

48:14.266 --> 48:17.561
<i>You will be fighting for your future</i>

48:18.312 --> 48:21.565
<i>I will be rotting in my cell</i>

48:22.149 --> 48:25.694
<i>Let tears flow like a fountain</i>

48:26.237 --> 48:28.989
<i>Forcing the guards to look away</i>

48:29.949 --> 48:33.619
<i>It'll always stay in our memory</i>

48:33.744 --> 48:35.996
<i>The scroll of Shakhov prison days</i>

48:36.122 --> 48:39.625
<i>And the freedom,
and the freedom tastes so good</i>

48:39.750 --> 48:43.671
<i>Mum and Dad, I don't doubt,
wait for you</i>

48:43.796 --> 48:46.132
<i>And your darling baby sister...</i>

48:46.257 --> 48:48.592
Hush! What's her name?

48:48.717 --> 48:50.177
What's her name? Come on!

48:50.719 --> 48:52.471
Come on! Say it!

48:53.097 --> 48:54.140
Alyonka?

48:54.265 --> 48:56.308
<i>Alyonka!</i>

48:56.434 --> 48:59.854
<i>She's waiting for your train
in the pouring rain</i>

49:00.479 --> 49:01.522
Mum!

49:12.658 --> 49:13.993
Bravo!

49:17.455 --> 49:19.832
<i>Let's drink to Ra ya,
our young Ra ya!</i>

49:19.957 --> 49:24.170
<i>The world hasn't seen
a drunkard like her!</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:28.549
<i>Raya, Raya, bottoms up!
We will fill another cup!</i>

49:28.674 --> 49:32.470
<i>Raya, Raya, bottoms up!
We will fill another cup!</i>

49:36.056 --> 49:40.519
When I worked for a newspaper,

49:41.270 --> 49:44.273
I wrote children's poetry,
poetry as if written by children.

49:44.398 --> 49:47.193
- Lard?
- Gherkins sitting in a jar.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.612
- Juicy, tasty as they are.
- Yes, yes.

49:49.737 --> 49:52.823
"Days and weeks go by,
Life is tough for little guys.

49:52.948 --> 49:55.576
"If the jar doesn't explode,
they will meet their end alone!"

49:55.701 --> 49:57.119
Dumb pickles!

49:57.244 --> 50:00.539
Hang on,
don't interrupt, there's more.

50:00.664 --> 50:04.710
"Couldn't wait another day,
pushed the lid off far away!

50:04.835 --> 50:06.670
"Seal the jar, it lasts for years.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.173
"Now the housewife's in tears."

50:09.798 --> 50:12.843
- I know a joke about cucumbers.
- Hang on, I'm not finished.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.513
That poem cost me my job!

50:15.638 --> 50:17.014
One day the boss says to me,

50:18.766 --> 50:19.808
"Did you Write this?"

50:23.604 --> 50:25.689
I foolishly thought
he would give me a raise,

50:25.814 --> 50:28.442
but they sacked me
for political propaganda.

50:29.026 --> 50:32.530
- They said my poem incited revolt.
- What fucking nonsense!

50:33.739 --> 50:34.907
Want one?

50:35.032 --> 50:37.576
Listen, guys,
I know a joke about cucumbers.

50:38.244 --> 50:40.788
A woman asks her neighbour,

50:40.913 --> 50:43.832
"How come your tomatoes grow so well?"

50:43.958 --> 50:47.336
And the neighbour says,
"I come to the greenhouse all naked,

50:47.461 --> 50:49.380
"and the tomatoes turn red."

50:49.505 --> 50:51.632
Hang on!
The next week they meet again.

50:51.757 --> 50:53.842
"Well, did it Work?

50:54.635 --> 50:57.638
"Not with tomatoes,
but the cucumbers

50:57.763 --> 50:59.223
"are coming up like crazy!"

51:02.810 --> 51:06.230
<i>Once he was cussing
the mother of mine</i>

51:06.897 --> 51:10.693
<i>But I don't care about this
all, I'm not due for parole</i>

51:10.818 --> 51:13.737
<i>So I'm staying here
for a long while!</i>

51:13.862 --> 51:14.947
But I don't care!

51:15.072 --> 51:16.991
<i>I'm not due for parole</i>

51:17.116 --> 51:19.159
<i>So I'm staying here
for a long while!</i>

51:19.285 --> 51:20.619
Go quiet your child!

51:20.744 --> 51:22.329
That's yours!

51:22.454 --> 51:25.040
Don't you think I know
my own child's cry?

51:25.165 --> 51:28.252
Shut up, all of you!

51:28.377 --> 51:30.379
- They are all mine!
- Yes?

51:33.757 --> 51:38.012
"A retired soldier,
a spent bullet.

51:38.137 --> 51:40.139
"He is still a warrior,

51:40.264 --> 51:41.557
"It's a joy to be with him!"

51:42.016 --> 51:43.642
Here you are, my beauty!

51:44.268 --> 51:46.186
- Give me the pickle!
- Wait!

51:46.312 --> 51:48.856
Give me that pickle!

51:50.232 --> 51:52.443
Let's do it this way.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.202
One!

52:02.328 --> 52:03.370
Two!

52:03.495 --> 52:05.581
Three! Four!

52:05.706 --> 52:08.042
- Hello! Yes!
- Five! Six!

52:08.167 --> 52:09.835
- Coming!
- Seven!

52:09.960 --> 52:11.962
Eight! Nine!

52:12.087 --> 52:13.714
- Go there.
- Ten!

52:17.843 --> 52:20.471
Listen, she's a weirdo.
Doesn't talk, doesn't drink...

52:20.596 --> 52:23.098
Won't drink, won't smoke,
won't fuck your brains out!

52:24.975 --> 52:26.685
Get out of here.

52:30.606 --> 52:33.651
- There's a man looking for you.
- What kind of man?

52:33.776 --> 52:37.363
I told him about your problem.
He wants to have a look at you.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.824
Don't be afraid. I know him.
You can trust him.

52:40.949 --> 52:42.868
He's waiting outside.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.056
You're the one?

53:05.140 --> 53:06.266
Yes.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.275
Got your passport on you?

53:17.528 --> 53:19.613
Come on, give it to me.
Don't be afraid.

53:45.931 --> 53:48.892
OK. Let me see how I can place you.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.061
"Place" me?

53:51.687 --> 53:55.649
Relax. I'm just talking.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.234
Thinking aloud.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.112
What are your measurements?

54:00.654 --> 54:02.114
What measurements?

54:02.614 --> 54:06.410
Well, you know,
38-24-38 or something like that...

54:07.578 --> 54:09.121
I don't know.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.706
What for?

54:11.707 --> 54:13.667
For the record.
Don't know.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.627
The boss needs to know.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.464
What boss?

54:18.589 --> 54:21.091
Look at you!
Do you know where you are?

54:21.675 --> 54:23.385
You've come to a prison town.

54:23.844 --> 54:25.679
A strategically important location.

54:25.804 --> 54:28.807
And every strategic location
has its bosses.

54:29.475 --> 54:31.727
You weren't sent here.
You came on your own, right?

54:32.311 --> 54:33.812
You've come to find out
about the fate of...

54:34.313 --> 54:36.732
Who is it?
Husband, father, son?

54:37.733 --> 54:38.901
So?

54:39.026 --> 54:41.028
Well, there you are.

54:41.737 --> 54:44.615
Enquiries about inmates
go straight to the bosses.

54:45.407 --> 54:49.453
If you behave,
this can be worked out.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.747
I've got an idea
that might work for you.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.667
Don't show your passport
to anyone else.

54:55.793 --> 54:58.420
If they ask for it,
tell them Armen has been informed.

54:59.421 --> 55:00.506
Who's Armen?

55:00.631 --> 55:03.133
Doesn't matter.
Just memorise my words.

55:03.592 --> 55:07.429
Don't go anywhere tomorrow.
Stay here and wait.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.181
Don't wander around town.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.309
I'll arrange everything
and get back to you.

55:12.434 --> 55:15.604
Or I'll send my guys for you,
if things move fast.

55:16.104 --> 55:17.981
We'll settle up later.

55:18.857 --> 55:20.776
I don't have much money.

55:21.693 --> 55:25.364
If you're broke,
you'll find another way to pay me.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.366
What do you mean?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.743
Don't worry.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.495
Just thinking aloud.

55:32.287 --> 55:35.374
Don't trust that old bag.
She's a real cunt.

55:37.709 --> 55:39.545
You smell good.

55:40.254 --> 55:42.214
Hey, old bag!

55:42.339 --> 55:44.925
Stop eavesdropping!
Your ears will drop off!

55:45.425 --> 55:48.720
Watch it, I'll report you
as an enemy of the people.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.973
You've got a real brothel here.

55:53.267 --> 55:54.643
Well, see you.

56:08.699 --> 56:09.992
Come on! Come on!

56:18.166 --> 56:19.334
Take it off!

56:19.459 --> 56:21.628
I told you she'd be the first!

56:22.796 --> 56:24.006
You take it off!

56:36.560 --> 56:38.395
God damn you!

56:38.520 --> 56:41.273
"Such heavy blossoms
are hanging off your chest.

56:41.398 --> 56:45.068
"We'll dress up top to bottom,
get ready for a feast."

56:46.278 --> 56:47.321
Idiot!

56:50.407 --> 56:52.075
Catch it!

56:53.619 --> 56:56.163
Don't you piss in here, asshole!

56:56.288 --> 56:57.664
"This is the end of my rhyme.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.333
"My life's not been easy as most.

56:59.458 --> 57:03.128
"I wanted to dance ballet in my prime,
but got stuck here at my post."

57:05.797 --> 57:07.424
Let's spin.

57:07.549 --> 57:08.759
I'm in.

57:15.223 --> 57:16.934
We found you at last!

57:17.059 --> 57:19.436
Penalty striptease!

57:20.103 --> 57:22.397
Penalty striptease!
Take it off!

57:35.661 --> 57:37.746
Take it off! Take it off!

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.314
Sign here.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.741
Next.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.130
- I'm not taking it.
- Why?

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.634
- Not allowed.
- Why is it not allowed?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.929
I told you yesterday
it's not allowed.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.389
It's not allowed.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.932
No point in arguing.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:46.476
Look in your files!
My husband is here.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.770
I have the right
to know where he is!

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.275
You need to file an enquiry.
I'm no information desk!

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.318
Next. Are you coming or not?

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.198
They do what they want!

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:03.618
Come back tomorrow.
They'll soften up.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:07.247
Sometimes they transfer people
to other prisons without a word.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.209
The people here suck.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.148
Next.

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:38.987
Here. Perhaps they can help you.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.448
At least you can register there.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.540
Are you sleeping there?

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.918
Who's this chick in the facility?

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.131
DO NOT ENTER

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.475
You're not allowed to stand here.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.812
You're not allowed to stand here.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.691
You don't get it?

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:42.819
OK.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:21.811
Lieutenant Zamurayev.
Let's take a ride.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.668
Stop here.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:43.309
Listen to me carefully.
It's all up to you.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:47.814
I can lock you up for illegal picketing.
That's number one.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:50.650
Disobeying police orders.
That's two.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:52.819
Or I find something in your bag.
Three.

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:54.112
Do you understand?

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.657
You were told your parcel
wouldn't be accepted?

01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:59.033
Right?

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.368
So?

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:03.955
So why did you come back today?
Weren't they clear?

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.832
What shall I do now?

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:09.043
File an enquiry with the authorities.

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:12.005
What authorities?
He's locked inside there.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.509
Who fights like that?

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.263
At last!

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:25.977
It's none of your business who's inside.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.062
It's a state secret.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:31.816
Why are you wasting your time?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.526
Shall we lock her up?

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.698
Yes, sweetheart.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.618
No, sweetheart.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.163
Yes, sweetheart.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:48.707
No, sweetheart.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.586
I'll call you later.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:53.462
Love you.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.840
Love you, sweetheart.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.676
If it were up to me,
I would have locked her up.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:03.514
- Who's in prison?
- My husband.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.850
You don't have a husband,
while he's in prison.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.310
Do you understand?

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.772
So what should I do?

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.483
I told you, she's stupid.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:15.151
Wait...

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:19.447
Go to the station, get on a train,
go home and go back to work.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.115
Do you have a job?

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.117
Good!

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:27.205
I'll let you go without a statement,
but keep your mouth shut.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.749
I'm being nice here.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.667
Any questions?

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.462
Well? To the station?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.716
See? We're being kind to you.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.643
32 shells,

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.522
32 shells.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:40.695
27 calibre machine gun.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.700
Fire a weapon like that,
you shoot a man to shreds.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.536
What do we care?

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.053
I've been looking for you
all morning.

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.014
Get in, quick!

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.057
Come on, it's for your own sake!

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.393
Don't be afraid, it's OK.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.396
I've arranged everything.
Get in! Come on!

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.485
Get in. Off we go.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.343
Don't you trust Pasha?

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.221
You think Pasha is bluffing?

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.724
You think Pasha is having you on?

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.602
You think Pasha is conning you?

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.816
I told you to stay home.
Why did you go there?

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:04.695
The cops had a chat with you?
They told you to piss off?

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:10.701
They're a bunch of clowns,
they can't do a thing.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.497
Don't mess with them.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:18.209
But they can't do anything.
It's all talk.

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:21.504
They're fucking nobodies.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:28.344
So I talked to this guy about you.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:31.722
We're going to go see him.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.768
He's busy with another deal right now.

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.645
What's this?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.105
What's up?

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.525
Come on, get off the road!

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.528
Out of the way!

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.781
Go on! Clear off!

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:58.124
I've got to pick up a hooker.
Then we'll deal with you.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.227
Wait here.

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:08.611
Have you no shame?

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:12.031
You're a whore, too?

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:14.742
This place is crawling with them!

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:16.953
Like bees on honey.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:21.457
Where does that pimp find you all?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.336
This residence is for the prison staff.

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:28.255
It's not a whorehouse.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.467
And they're all bitches and thieves!

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.680
The whores all dissolved in acid!

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.813
I work like a slave from dawn till dusk.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.732
You think it's easy to wash clothes?

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.236
Look at my hands.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:53.239
Are you scared?

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:56.742
You should be.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:03.124
I've been caring for my man all my life,

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.086
and he went off screwing whores.

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:11.716
Yes!

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:17.304
The whores all dissolved in acid!

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.640
And he's there with them.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.351
Yes... There, in the acid pit.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.730
I saw with my own eyes,
how it ate everything.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:29.442
Not a single bone left.
All gone!

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.944
No condom will save you!

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.866
Now you want to whore, too?

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.704
So old, but still wants to whore!

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:45.541
You don't want to wash clothes?
You don't want soap and water?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.961
You'll wind up in the acid pit.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.573
Go figure!
Her man hanged himself long ago,

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:20.117
and she's still washing his underwear.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:24.663
There's no place to send her.
Our asylum burned down.

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:27.083
They say the patients set it on fire.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:31.212
But what the fuck for,
since they all died?

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:35.174
They were all nuts,
so I guess it figures.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.055
Listen.

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.768
She calls me up
and says to come over and chill.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:50.189
So she brings a friend along,
the one with no tits.

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:51.649
You know her!

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.401
Crazy bitch!

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:57.696
We took some booze along,
to loosen things up.

01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:00.199
And we were chilling.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:03.160
Out of the blue,
she needs a fucking phone charger!

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.912
And I didn't hear her.

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.747
So she loses it!

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.415
You're not my fucking friend!

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.794
I asked you as my fucking friend
and you said no!

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:14.755
So I tell her to shut her fucking mouth!

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.215
We start fighting.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.468
And this dumb whore
is laughing like a maniac.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.096
She calls me bitch, I call her bitch!
She's laughing!

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.348
So we thrashed her.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:27.726
Thrashed her how?
Did you mess her up?

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:31.981
Only her head.
She's thick as a brick, anyway.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:36.068
Know what her problem was?
She got jealous over a client!

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.320
He said I suck dick better than her!

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:41.532
How would he know, anyway?
He was dead drunk!

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.492
What a fucking story...

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:45.035
Goddamn joke!

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.372
Who's she?

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.207
None of your business.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.418
You fucking pervert.
Into old bags now?

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:54.128
Shut the fuck up!

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:02.261
Relax. I'm kidding.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.014
I've got a stressful job.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:07.766
One client even tried to set me on fire.

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:11.937
He smeared some stuff on me
and lit it up. It tickled.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.690
I'm on fire and he's fucking me.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:17.318
Fucking pervert...

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:34.335
When you get bored with old bags,
come over.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.829
He's the top brass here.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:15.876
He's the man.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.462
He's in charge here.
Sorts everything.

01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:21.215
Got the cops in the palm of his hand.

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:26.887
We all help each other here.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:30.516
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.309
That's how we survive.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.438
No need for money.
It's barter.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:43.862
Good job the tables
are screwed to the floor.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:46.323
Let me go, asshole!

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:51.036
I don't get it. Where do I sit?

01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:53.956
Pyotr Nikolaevich,
I'm warming up a seat for you.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.209
Shut it!

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.380
Here. As promised.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.257
Get lost.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:07.511
Sit down.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:20.941
How you doing?

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:22.943
I'm not.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:31.076
I sent a parcel.
It came back.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.830
I come here. They won't take it.
They tell me to leave.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:36.665
Cops are pigs.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.086
What are you going to do?

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:42.963
I don't know.

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:45.549
They say you can help me.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:48.177
Don't trust people.
They're pigs too.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:50.804
Including you?

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.723
Including me.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:57.186
- So should I go?
- Go.

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.105
But where?

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.075
You say they didn't accept
your parcel...

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:13.660
I had this kid.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:16.747
Real good kid. One of my guys.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.209
I let him go to war.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:26.507
He was eager to fight.
He was restless, bored.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.968
Couldn't stand to see all those fascists.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:31.929
He had a good heart.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.181
If your motherland is in danger,
you save it.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:37.518
All that crap.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.563
Sol let him go.
I figured, he's young.

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.274
He should have fun.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:47.236
He was good at technical stuff.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.116
So they stuck him...

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.660
...on recycling.

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.995
Do you know what that is?

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.792
Getting rid of body parts.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:07.047
Arms, legs, body parts.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.759
It's a mobile crematorium,
near the front.

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:14.638
You need nerves of steel
to do a job like that.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.306
He had them.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.267
And his girlfriend was a firebrand.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.060
She wanted to join him.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.522
But he told her to stay home.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:27.985
One day, they delivered
a load of remains for recycling.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.987
He started up his fire.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:34.867
There he was,
tossing chunks of flesh on it.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.870
And he saw a hand that looked familiar.

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:40.456
With a ring on it.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:43.375
Her ring.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.378
He asked around, among the guys.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:48.881
It was true.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:51.800
It was her.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.515
That's how they met again.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:03.896
Love“.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:12.029
He lost his mind after that,
mad as a hatter.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:18.243
They were gonna shoot him.
They took pity and sent him back.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:21.663
He was a good guy.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.757
When I saw you, I thought of him.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.512
- Mishanya!
- Nikolayevich!

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:39.848
You?
Fancy seeing you here!

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.142
Guys, Mishanya is back!

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.520
Well done, you made it!

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:47.564
- When did you get out?
- Just now.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:50.317
Come, tell me everything.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.490
Manya, bring us some vodka!

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:03.997
She was a drug addict
and a dealer.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:07.960
And she got caught.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:10.379
Somebody reported her, or something.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.423
When they caught her,
she swallowed her stash.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:15.175
I don't get it.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.762
She ate the drug.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.097
Did she get real high?

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:22.724
Bastards stuck a finger down
her throat to get it out.

01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:24.977
She croaked.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.397
They threw the corpse into a swamp.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.816
A drunk told me
they found her in autumn.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:34.152
Mouth all torn. No pictures.
Just boxed her and buried her.

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:35.612
Assholes!

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.156
And the cop who arrested her
disappeared.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:41.118
But who will avenge
a pile of rotting guts?

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.078
The cop must've been killed.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.706
Whose bitch is she?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.384
- Excuse me. Dzerzhinsky Street?
- That way.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.316
Excuse me.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.736
How do I get to Dzerzhinsky Street?

01:25:57.861 --> 01:25:59.946
- Where?
- Dzerzhinsky Street.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:03.825
He was a great man.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.578
He deserved an avenue.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:10.624
But there are no avenues
in this shit hole.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:16.338
Go straight down Hegel Street,
then turn right on Marx.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:20.884
There's a crossing,
with a burnt down house.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:23.637
Belonged to a mate,
who died in the fire.

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:26.640
Turn left on Lenin,
past the cafeteria,

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:29.518
Lots of empty bottles there.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:34.439
Then you need to turn,
or take the short cut.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.442
No, you'll get lost.

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.528
Go the way I told you.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:41.405
What house number do you need?

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:44.700
11.

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:49.246
- Going to the agents, right?
- What agents?

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.123
Go, go.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.041
You'll find out.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.295
Marx, fucking Marx.

01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:01.550
What a great country they fucked up!
Faggots.

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:02.801
Fuck.

01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:34.624
What do you want?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.380
- Is this number 11?
- 11,11...

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.674
Who are you looking for?

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.509
There's a committee here.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.386
Going to the fascists, are you?

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.930
That way.
Round the house, up the stairs.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:50.307
Tell them to fuck off!

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.517
We have enough whores round here.

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.561
Why are you going there?

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:59.649
The Yanks should pay for our drains,
not feed those pricks.

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.237
Go, go...

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.114
Go and tell them.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.708
- Have you written that?
- Yes.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:20.212
Right.
The other policemen...

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:23.048
Is this the office
of human rights activists?

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:25.967
Shouted at her
and verbally abused her,

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:29.596
calling her "an American agent"
and "a traitor".

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.599
- "A traitor", have you got that?
- Yes.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:40.482
And also accusing her of selling
state secrets to foreign states.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:43.527
New paragraph...

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:46.613
What can we do for you?

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.616
My husband is in prison here.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:53.078
Several days ago,
a parcel was returned to me.

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:56.832
I've come here to inquire,
but nobody speaks to me.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.459
They refer me
to "appropriate authorities".

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:01.336
I don't know what to do.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:02.712
I see.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.631
Just a moment.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:06.800
So.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:09.219
Here you are.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.472
Fill it out, please.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.641
Here's the form.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:20.063
There's an empty table there.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.233
And there's a pen here somewhere.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.529
Fill it Out.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.701
New paragraph.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.579
New paragraph.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:40.208
According to the victim...

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:49.843
...the policemen
called the medical workers,

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:53.597
who gave her three injections,

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:58.018
after which she began to feel weak.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:03.273
The woman was stripped naked...

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.278
The woman was stripped naked

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:15.243
and twice underwent
a vaginal examination.

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.078
Or how should we put it?

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:20.916
"Vaginal probe".

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.376
I know!

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:26.630
They carried out
a search of her vagina!

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.465
They searched her vagina?

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.634
- I'll google it now.
- OK.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:34.554
Now.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:39.768
"Bi-digital exam: two fingers inserted
for this examination."

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:41.311
It really exists.

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:46.566
I see. Vaginal examination.

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:54.032
When the doctor failed to locate
the memory card,

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.703
the policemen ordered the victim...

01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:02.082
What are you listening to?
Get back to work, Vasya!

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:07.963
The policemen ordered the victim
to sit on a chair.

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:13.259
The policemen held her
by her arms and legs,

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.471
While...

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:23.937
while the doctor inserted
into her vagina

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:30.819
a gynaecological mirror
in order to continue the search.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.573
As a result of the above manipulations,

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:42.288
the victim... began to bleed.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.082
Bastards.

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:45.583
In addition,

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:51.006
a rectal examination
was performed on the victim.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.094
OK, that's enough.

01:31:56.928 --> 01:32:02.434
Add a heading,
and send it to the mailing list.

01:32:02.559 --> 01:32:05.854
- Should I copy them, as well?
- No. Not them.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.731
Let them figure it out.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.316
So what have we got here?

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:20.201
Very good.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.746
Our lawyer...

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:30.295
...will have a look at it
and file an official complaint.

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:35.717
Sign here and date it.

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:40.847
OK. Then we'll see.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.476
- How long does it take?
- I don't know.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.688
I don't know.
Approximately 3 weeks.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.775
Isn't it possible
to find out something now?

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:54.778
Listen, my dear.

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:58.406
Did you hear
what we are dealing with?

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:02.619
I feel very sorry for you,

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.205
but don't you see
how many complaints I have!

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:09.250
Don't think that your case is unique.

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:13.963
We're dealing with urgent cases,

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:17.509
like that one,
with vaginal bleeding.

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:21.721
We need to save this woman's life.

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:25.892
Can't you see what's going on here!

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:30.105
There are only two of us here...
Two and a half...

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.899
and we are raided every week.

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:34.734
Every week!

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:37.445
Look at the windows!

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.951
We had to board them up
to stop them breaking the glass.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.705
We are defending their rights
and they...

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:50.667
...they paint swastikas on our walls.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:53.753
They break the windows!

01:33:56.756 --> 01:34:01.261
My heart goes out to them.

01:34:02.428 --> 01:34:07.976
And in return they pour water
on our front steps in winter,

01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:10.812
so that we can't get out.

01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:14.399
We're like prisoners here!

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:21.197
What kind of people are they?

01:34:31.749 --> 01:34:33.001
My grandson.

01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:37.422
They beat him up...

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:41.301
...they broke his arm.

01:34:45.972 --> 01:34:47.348
Bastards.

01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:58.776
Excuse me. Is there an address?

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:01.362
How are we supposed to contact you?

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:04.324
Did you write down
your phone number?

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:06.367
Oh, yes.

01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:08.453
I see it.

01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:12.081
OK then.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:17.712
You know what?

01:35:18.922 --> 01:35:20.924
Here's our address.

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:24.719
I don't know who'll be around,
where or when.

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.142
But we're still here for now.

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:35.688
So nobody else can help me?

01:35:38.024 --> 01:35:39.400
God Almighty.

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:43.363
Anything is possible.
Anything.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.199
Here, take this.

01:35:49.035 --> 01:35:50.286
Call us.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.753
Madam.

01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:00.922
Wait.

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:04.550
I'll see you out.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:23.403
All messed up.

01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:48.594
Shoo!

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:53.474
See, they shoo us away.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:55.893
They've always despised us.

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:59.272
And that's not the worst of it.

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:00.940
Shoo!

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:06.821
At times I think that they forgot

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.615
to put us inside the prison,
simply by mistake.

01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:12.285
Maybe they ran out of barbed wire.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.537
There's something else
I need to tell you.

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.624
All the information,

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:26.507
which we receive,
all ends up

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:28.760
with the special services.

01:37:29.635 --> 01:37:31.220
Do you understand me?

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:38.186
The person who files a complaint
could face some difficulties.

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.815
I had to tell you that.

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.278
So let me know
if you change your mind.

01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:50.698
- What should I do?
- I don't know.

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:55.495
It's your decision.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.913
Think it over.

01:37:57.455 --> 01:37:59.165
You're going to the train station?

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:03.211
It's over there, turn right
as you exit the courtyard.

01:38:03.878 --> 01:38:07.465
Walk to the crossroads and turn left.

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:12.095
Then, go straight to the train station.

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.013
You're going there now?

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:15.473
Well, OK.

01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:33.259
- You're not asleep?
- No.

01:39:42.435 --> 01:39:45.438
Don't sleep.
You shouldn't sleep here.

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:49.400
I fell asleep once and got lost.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:52.778
You shouldn't sleep in train stations.

01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:55.114
Before you know it,

01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:58.326
you'll be carried off and left for lost.

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:02.955
So you're not asleep?

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.832
No, I'm not asleep.

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:07.502
That's good.
You shouldn't sleep.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.837
What's in your bag?

01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:11.881
Some things. Why?

01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:19.388
I had a bag once,
but I don't remember what I had in it.

01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:25.436
Have you seen my sister here,
by any chance?

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:29.357
She looks exactly like me, exactly.

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:34.695
Only I wear a knit hat,
and she has a scarf.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.990
- I haven't seen her.
- What a shame.

01:40:38.574 --> 01:40:40.326
We used to live together.

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:44.622
Her husband passed away,
and mine passed away.

01:40:46.165 --> 01:40:48.376
So we decided
to live together again.

01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:50.586
Like when we were children.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:55.883
And then some people came
and kicked us out onto the street.

01:40:57.343 --> 01:41:01.097
Our husbands passed away.
Nobody to protect us.

01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:04.058
So we took to the streets.

01:41:06.686 --> 01:41:08.271
But then she got lost.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:13.901
Would you like some bread?

01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:15.319
No, thank you.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:21.200
Then I'll go and look for her.

01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:26.205
And don't fall asleep
or you'll be carried off.

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:46.762
Let's go.

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.181
I've arranged everything.

01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:51.142
Go where?

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.227
Let's go. Let's go.

01:43:54.145 --> 01:43:57.106
I've arranged everything.
You'll see.

01:45:04.673 --> 01:45:05.800
Is it her?

01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:07.718
Yes, it is.

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:10.971
Your passport, please.

01:45:23.234 --> 01:45:24.735
Could you come closer?

01:45:36.956 --> 01:45:40.209
Please, madam,
help yourself to the furs.

01:45:42.545 --> 01:45:44.255
Come on, don't make a fuss.

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.188
Let's go!

01:46:16.412 --> 01:46:22.418
<i>You rode on a troika with sleigh bells</i>

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:28.299
<i>And in the distance flickered lights</i>

01:46:28.966 --> 01:46:33.929
<i>If only I could follow you now, falcons</i>

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:39.810
<i>And dispel the grief that fills my heart!</i>

01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:47.359
<i>By the long road, in the moonlight</i>

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:51.697
<i>And with this song that rings so far away</i>

01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:56.368
<i>And with this ancient, seven-stringer</i>

01:46:56.493 --> 01:47:02.583
<i>That has tormented me so by night</i>

01:47:06.378 --> 01:47:12.092
<i>Now, living with no joy, with no sorrow</i>

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:17.681
<i>I recall the years gone by</i>

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:22.686
<i>And your silver hands</i>

01:47:23.228 --> 01:47:29.902
<i>Flying off forever in the troika...</i>

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:36.325
<i>By the long road, in the moonlight</i>

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:40.663
<i>And with this song that rings so far away</i>

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:45.584
<i>And with this ancient, seven-stringer</i>

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:53.717
<i>That has tormented me so by night</i>

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:06.188
<i>As time goes by, the sorrow grows</i>

01:48:06.772 --> 01:48:12.277
<i>It's so hard to forget our past</i>

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:18.242
<i>Somehow, one day, my dear</i>

01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:24.665
<i>You'll take me to the graveyard</i>

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:31.380
<i>By the long road, in the moonlight</i>

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:35.759
<i>And with this song that rings so far away</i>

01:48:35.884 --> 01:48:40.639
<i>And with this ancient, seven-stringer</i>

01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:49.898
<i>That has tormented me so by night</i>

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:53.986
Which one is she?

01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:57.614
You stay here, and you follow me.

01:51:25.095 --> 01:51:27.097
MAIL

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:02.693
It's Yasha.

01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:06.530
He's always on duty.

01:53:15.372 --> 01:53:16.748
Take off your coat.

01:53:33.724 --> 01:53:35.100
Do you have another dress?

01:53:37.769 --> 01:53:40.230
Always hard to know
what could be the right outfit.

01:53:41.064 --> 01:53:42.232
Yes, I do.

01:53:43.358 --> 01:53:44.693
Get changed.

01:53:45.902 --> 01:53:47.279
Right here?

01:53:48.113 --> 01:53:49.406
Where else?

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.827
And hurry.
It's only us here.

01:54:07.007 --> 01:54:08.467
Hurry.

01:54:27.361 --> 01:54:28.820
Hurry, faster.

01:55:27.712 --> 01:55:28.964
Please, proceed.

01:55:35.095 --> 01:55:37.055
An embarrassing memory.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:40.934
<i>Once</i> I <i>sang Gryaznov in The Tsar's Bride.</i>

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:42.519
It was a very serious role,

01:55:43.145 --> 01:55:45.105
but suddenly the audience began to stir.

01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:48.066
At first, it was dull.

01:55:48.650 --> 01:55:50.110
Naturally, it's an opera.

01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:53.655
The place is full of soldiers
with their smell of boot polish.

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.532
Suddenly, they begin to laugh.

01:55:56.616 --> 01:56:00.620
What? Has my beard come unstuck?

01:56:00.745 --> 01:56:03.081
Then I felt a laser beam
shining in my eyes.

01:56:03.206 --> 01:56:04.833
And I got it!

01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:06.835
While I was singing,

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:10.172
somebody was aiming a laser beam
straight at my mouth.

01:56:11.173 --> 01:56:15.177
The audience was waiting to see,
would I get hit or not get hit?

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.431
So I turned and showed them my ass
till the end of the opera.

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:31.443
<i>O, innocent martyr, forgive me</i>

01:56:32.402 --> 01:56:40.368
<i>Forgive me for each tear I caused you</i>

01:56:40.952 --> 01:56:44.247
<i>For each cry of yours</i>

01:56:44.372 --> 01:56:49.377
<i>And for every breath of yours, Martha</i>

01:56:50.754 --> 01:56:57.427
<i>I will make sure to pay in full</i>

01:56:58.136 --> 01:57:05.519
<i>Before Tsar Ivan I'll kneel</i>

01:57:05.644 --> 01:57:11.691
<i>To beg for such tortures</i>

01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:20.992
<i>The sinners in hell don't know</i>

01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:24.162
<i>Farewell!</i>

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:27.832
<i>Farewell!</i>

01:57:43.431 --> 01:57:44.808
Now it's your turn, please.

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.062
Dear comrades.

01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.273
Dearly beloved.

01:57:52.774 --> 01:57:54.276
I'm nervous.

01:57:54.401 --> 01:57:56.403
I don't even know where to start.

01:57:57.112 --> 01:58:00.574
No one in our family
has ever gone to prison.

01:58:01.074 --> 01:58:02.909
So when our grandson
is old enough,

01:58:03.034 --> 01:58:06.913
God willing,
he'll do the family this honour.

01:58:07.581 --> 01:58:10.125
And in my old age,
I've been blessed

01:58:10.834 --> 01:58:14.796
with a chance to see the world
and meet good people.

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:17.257
Thank you, my clears.

01:58:19.009 --> 01:58:23.597
I love you with all my heart,
and I'll be praying for you.

01:58:24.681 --> 01:58:26.975
I wish you all the best!

01:58:34.983 --> 01:58:36.151
Please.

01:58:37.027 --> 01:58:42.824
On behalf of the post office
number 2688,

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:46.077
I would like to thank you
for your trust.

01:58:46.202 --> 01:58:47.787
I would also like to assure you

01:58:47.912 --> 01:58:50.957
that we,
workers of the Russian Post,

01:58:51.082 --> 01:58:56.046
aspire to provide service
of the highest quality and excellence.

01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:58.048
Here are a few figures:

01:58:58.173 --> 01:59:01.134
In 2016 we processed...

01:59:07.474 --> 01:59:08.516
Please.

01:59:09.392 --> 01:59:11.811
As a bus passenger,
I have a statement.

01:59:11.936 --> 01:59:14.439
I don't know this woman well.

01:59:14.564 --> 01:59:17.442
I did not know
that her husband was in prison.

01:59:17.901 --> 01:59:20.904
We all travel but we don't know
our fellow passengers.

01:59:21.446 --> 01:59:23.698
We have to pay more attention
to each other.

01:59:24.366 --> 01:59:25.742
This is what I wanted to say.

01:59:32.874 --> 01:59:34.459
Now it's your turn, please.

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:37.212
My father is a war veteran.

01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:46.388
I dreamed of becoming a policeman
since I was a child.

01:59:47.263 --> 01:59:50.433
I realised my dream through
studying at a police school

01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:54.145
and then serving at my post.

01:59:56.773 --> 02:00:00.485
Even though we live in peace,
we must always be vigilant.

02:00:01.528 --> 02:00:03.655
We all know that enemies
are in our midst.

02:00:04.364 --> 02:00:06.282
For example, at my post of duty,

02:00:07.075 --> 02:00:08.618
a hot spot, a railway station,

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.079
thousands of people walk past me
every day.

02:00:11.538 --> 02:00:14.416
My duty is to defend
law-abiding citizens,

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:19.713
to catch criminals and terrorists,
who seek to damage our country

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.882
and do evil things to our Motherland.

02:00:24.592 --> 02:00:28.680
I stopped this citizen on suspicion
of a crime, for no reason.

02:00:29.264 --> 02:00:33.435
She was subjected to a random check,
and she submitted to it.

02:00:40.483 --> 02:00:41.526
You, please.

02:00:47.031 --> 02:00:50.744
I appeal to you on behalf
of the women of Russia,

02:00:50.869 --> 02:00:53.913
wives, mothers, girlfriends, sisters,

02:00:54.038 --> 02:00:56.458
daughters, grandmothers
and granddaughters.

02:00:56.958 --> 02:00:59.753
Our lot has always been hard,
but honourable.

02:00:59.878 --> 02:01:04.007
We supported our men
during times of hardship and suffering.

02:01:04.549 --> 02:01:07.177
We fought by their side,

02:01:07.302 --> 02:01:09.220
took care of them,
looked after them,

02:01:09.345 --> 02:01:12.515
and we kept them warm with
our love and our compassion.

02:01:13.016 --> 02:01:15.018
To be a woman in Russia

02:01:15.143 --> 02:01:17.312
is to be more than simply a woman!

02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:21.524
For centuries an ordinary Russian woman
could tame a wild horse

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:23.985
and break into a burning wooden hut.

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:29.240
Though today our men have
swapped their horses for SUVs,

02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:31.493
and their huts for townhouses,

02:01:31.618 --> 02:01:36.581
still, just like in the times
of the writer Nekrasov,

02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:41.127
it is we Russian women,
who have to carry the burden

02:01:41.252 --> 02:01:45.006
of living in this country
and saving our men,

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:47.383
and leading them along the road

02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:50.720
of fighting for world peace!

02:01:56.893 --> 02:01:57.936
Please.

02:01:58.436 --> 02:01:59.813
Pyotr Nikolayevich!

02:02:06.611 --> 02:02:08.780
We have two powers,

02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:12.867
one in uniform, one without.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:15.537
We are always there.

02:02:16.037 --> 02:02:17.497
You can't do a thing without us.

02:02:18.706 --> 02:02:20.500
This is what I'm trying to say.

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:23.545
Guys...

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:27.799
...don't beat each other up.

02:02:38.852 --> 02:02:40.436
Please, it's your turn.

02:02:41.938 --> 02:02:44.315
There lived a cockroach in the world.

02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:48.444
Such was his condition,

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:52.407
In a glass he chanced to fall
Full of fly-perdition.

02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:55.910
Meaning the way flies get trapped
inside a glass in summer,

02:02:56.369 --> 02:02:59.247
where they fight each other.
Any idiot will get that.

02:03:01.124 --> 02:03:04.752
The roach squeezed against the flies,
they woke up and did curse,

02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:08.965
"Beseeched Jove with their angry cries
the glass is full to burst!

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:12.302
"In the middle of the din
came along Nikifor,

02:03:12.427 --> 02:03:15.597
"A fine old man, and looking in..."

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.476
...I haven't quite finished.

02:03:21.019 --> 02:03:23.229
But I'll tell it in my own words!

02:03:24.814 --> 02:03:28.401
Nikifor takes the glass,
and despite their cries, empties it.

02:03:29.193 --> 02:03:33.364
Flies, beetles and all,
fall into the trough.

02:03:34.157 --> 02:03:37.577
Which ought to have been done
long ago.

02:03:38.661 --> 02:03:41.706
But take note, comrades.

02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:44.167
The cockroach doesn't complain.

02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:47.211
That's the answer to your
question, why?

02:03:47.921 --> 02:03:50.465
The cockroach does not complain.

02:03:51.758 --> 02:03:54.761
As for Nikifor he represents nature.

02:03:59.682 --> 02:04:00.725
Please.

02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:06.481
I love my work very much.

02:04:07.607 --> 02:04:13.655
I defend human rights
inside a prison.

02:04:14.530 --> 02:04:17.158
And not just of one human,
but of many different humans,

02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:24.290
with very interesting destinies.

02:04:24.415 --> 02:04:27.126
It inspires me greatly.

02:04:27.627 --> 02:04:31.547
I'm happy that in our prison

02:04:31.673 --> 02:04:35.009
I've been entrusted

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.515
with such an honourable task
as fighting against human rights.

02:04:41.015 --> 02:04:46.396
The more I toil in this field,

02:04:46.521 --> 02:04:52.110
the more I realise
that we are not cockroaches,

02:04:52.235 --> 02:04:55.989
as the previous comrade put it.

02:04:56.114 --> 02:04:59.909
We are the agents of our great...

02:05:01.285 --> 02:05:08.960
...multi-ethnic, long-suffering
victorious nation!

02:05:09.502 --> 02:05:14.048
Each person in our prison
is worth their weight in gold.

02:05:14.716 --> 02:05:18.511
"Mankind, how proud that sounds!"
said Gorky.

02:05:19.053 --> 02:05:23.725
And I, just like a galley slave...

02:05:24.767 --> 02:05:25.893
...I will...

02:05:27.311 --> 02:05:34.068
...to my final breath,
toil for the good of our peoples.

02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:40.992
It fills me with happiness,
such happiness,

02:05:41.117 --> 02:05:43.244
that my descendants and I,

02:05:43.786 --> 02:05:46.372
had the good fortune to be born,

02:05:47.457 --> 02:05:56.632
to live, to die and to be buried
in the bowels of our dear,

02:05:57.592 --> 02:06:02.513
our beloved,
Russian Federation!

02:06:12.106 --> 02:06:13.316
Thank you.

02:06:15.651 --> 02:06:20.323
All right, I'd like to conclude
this discussion.

02:06:21.157 --> 02:06:26.204
Although, what discussion could there be
amongst ordinary people?

02:06:26.329 --> 02:06:30.833
One comes across
people like us every day,

02:06:31.501 --> 02:06:35.088
in every corner of our great country.

02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:38.883
And each of these people is human,

02:06:39.717 --> 02:06:42.595
and each of these people
is right in his own way.

02:06:43.387 --> 02:06:47.391
And we should respect and cherish this.

02:06:48.559 --> 02:06:55.483
Because each of these people
is a part of our nation's legacy,

02:06:55.942 --> 02:07:01.656
of our national spiritual heritage,
our national wealth.

02:07:02.573 --> 02:07:04.534
Am I right, comrades?

02:07:05.118 --> 02:07:07.078
Yes! That's right!

02:07:10.581 --> 02:07:12.083
The country's treasures

02:07:13.167 --> 02:07:16.963
are not limited to its soil,
reserves and pantries, no.

02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:22.969
Our main treasure
is the people.

02:07:24.804 --> 02:07:26.180
The people.

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:29.559
The most valuable thing we have.

02:07:30.893 --> 02:07:34.105
Just like we, who are gathered here,

02:07:35.148 --> 02:07:37.650
ordinary labourers, heroes.

02:07:38.901 --> 02:07:41.404
This must be valued,

02:07:43.114 --> 02:07:46.617
respected, and preserved.

02:07:48.828 --> 02:07:50.538
People are thoughtless
creatures,

02:07:50.663 --> 02:07:52.790
they know not what they do,

02:07:52.915 --> 02:07:56.460
and so they transgress the law.

02:07:56.586 --> 02:07:59.630
But we won't allow them.

02:08:00.381 --> 02:08:03.885
We'll explain,
we'll stop them.

02:08:05.011 --> 02:08:09.765
And if someone won't hear us,
we'll force them to.

02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:13.186
We won't allow it!

02:08:14.145 --> 02:08:17.398
They'll be caught, sentenced,
punished, and released!

02:08:20.151 --> 02:08:22.737
Isn't that right, comrades?

02:08:23.279 --> 02:08:25.448
Right!

02:08:27.283 --> 02:08:28.868
My Motherland.

02:08:28.993 --> 02:08:31.662
My Motherland has appointed me
Prison Warden.

02:08:32.121 --> 02:08:36.709
I came here as a young man
and I will stay here till the end,

02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:40.963
no matter what happens,
doing any job.

02:08:41.088 --> 02:08:45.259
Sure, I rose to this great
position gradually,

02:08:45.384 --> 02:08:47.970
but today,
from where I stand today,

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:49.597
I say to you,

02:08:51.015 --> 02:08:53.267
every one of you,

02:08:55.061 --> 02:08:56.229
I can't.

02:08:57.647 --> 02:09:01.692
I can't manage such a great
establishment alone.

02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:06.781
I need your help,
and support.

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:08.866
I need your support,

02:09:09.784 --> 02:09:13.120
your support,
the support of the masses.

02:09:14.622 --> 02:09:16.040
And to get that support,

02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:21.545
we have to be in one harness,
in one team.

02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:24.173
We must pull together.

02:09:24.298 --> 02:09:27.468
That's why I have to know
everything about you.

02:09:28.844 --> 02:09:34.767
I have to understand everybody,
value and love them.

02:09:36.978 --> 02:09:39.438
I hope you get my point.

02:09:40.898 --> 02:09:43.025
We got it!

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:47.655
Dear friends,

02:09:49.365 --> 02:09:52.034
today we are celebrating
a great day.

02:09:52.159 --> 02:09:56.205
A day of unity for the prison
and the people.

02:09:57.123 --> 02:10:01.836
And this has become
a fine tradition now.

02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:06.173
To mark this clay with displays
of goodwill and compassion.

02:10:07.591 --> 02:10:08.801
Towards whom?

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:14.640
Who deserves compassion
more than others?

02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:18.561
Those who are craving it.

02:10:19.353 --> 02:10:21.397
Our inmates.

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:25.443
Therefore, this will confirm,

02:10:26.193 --> 02:10:30.031
in accordance
with the present document,

02:10:30.156 --> 02:10:33.743
the applicant inquiring
about parcel number K2-7429,

02:10:33.868 --> 02:10:36.537
has been granted a meeting
with her husband,

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:43.794
number 75698437,
currently serving a sentence

02:10:43.919 --> 02:10:47.757
at the penitentiary
establishment number 786543,

02:10:47.882 --> 02:10:50.468
for the purpose
of supplying him with food

02:10:50.593 --> 02:10:52.678
as well as essential items.

02:10:52.803 --> 02:10:55.848
And also for the purpose
of private communication

02:10:55.973 --> 02:10:59.226
at a specially equipped facility.

02:10:59.727 --> 02:11:01.395
Hurrah, comrades!

02:11:01.937 --> 02:11:03.147
Hurrah!

02:11:03.272 --> 02:11:04.440
Hurrah!

02:11:04.565 --> 02:11:05.608
Hurrah!

02:11:24.835 --> 02:11:27.088
You may sit down
and start eating.

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:30.049
Help yourselves to some food.

02:11:30.174 --> 02:11:31.634
Enjoy.

02:16:40.316 --> 02:16:43.153
Let's go.
I've arranged everything.

02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:45.572
Go where?

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:49.325
Let's go.
I've arranged everything.

02:16:50.576 --> 02:16:52.037
You'll see.

02:18:30.305 --> 02:18:36.709
