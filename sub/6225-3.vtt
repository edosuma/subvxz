DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.256 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.025
(SCREAMING)

02:23.978 --> 02:26.647
| came back in with some extra
blankets, there was a candle

02:26.731 --> 02:28.649
-but I put it out.
-Are you sure?

02:28.733 --> 02:30.401
| blew it out. I swear.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.238
Gwen's been Morgana's servant for years,
if she said she blew it out, I believe her.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.161
She could've been burnt alive.

02:40.244 --> 02:44.332
Lightning struck the castle
roof last night that could've started the fire.

02:44.415 --> 02:47.710
-Perhaps.
-What other explanation is there?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.756
Someone started the fire
deliberately.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.598
How did they reach Morgana's
chambers unchallenged?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.933
| don't know. There are too many guards,
it shouldn't be possible.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.519
-Yet they managed to do so.
-I can't explain it.

03:05.603 --> 03:08.064
Well I can. They used magic.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.942
Arrest all those we have
under suspicion.

03:12.068 --> 03:16.197
-That's going to take time.
-My ward has been attacked.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.282
Time is
something we do not have!

03:22.286 --> 03:24.288
GAIUS: What I don't
understand, Morgana,

03:24.372 --> 03:26.874
is how the fire started
in the first place.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.710
MORGANA:
It happened so quickly. It was terrifying.

03:29.794 --> 03:33.422
GAIUS: It's all right.
You're safe now.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.260
You're the only
person I've told about my dreams.

03:40.304 --> 03:43.641
-I know I can trust you, Gaius.
-Yes, of course you can.

03:44.767 --> 03:49.271
It was me.
| set the room alight, I started the fire.

03:51.107 --> 03:53.734
| don't understand,
did you knock a candle over...

03:53.818 --> 03:55.569
No, that's not what happened.

03:57.154 --> 04:01.575
| did it just by looking at it.
The flame suddenly leapt higher.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.162
-It could've been a gust of wind.
-It wasn't. It was me.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.916
It was magic.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.922
-My child...
-I'm not a child!

04:15.005 --> 04:18.591
Last night was an accident.
It had nothing to do with you.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.428
How could it have?
| am going to draw you up

04:21.512 --> 04:25.099
a fresh remedy that will
make you feel better. I promise.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.475
You must trust me.

04:39.864 --> 04:42.533

Morgana's chambers earlier.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.951
Hmm?

04:44.034 --> 04:47.288
The window was blown out
into the courtyard below.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.497
Mmm.

04:50.374 --> 04:54.420
It's odd, isn't it? If lightning struck
the window like Arthur said,

04:54.503 --> 04:58.340
you'd think the glass would
have fallen inside of the window.

04:58.424 --> 05:03.679
It was magic. You know it was
and more importantly so does she.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.309
-Morgana knows nothing for certain.
-Which makes it even worse.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.437
She isn't sure what's happening to her
and it's tearing her apart.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.648
-What would you have me do?
-Talk to her.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.611
Tell her she'll be okay.

05:18.694 --> 05:22.698
Tell her that her powers
aren't something to be afraid of.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.074
| can't.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.539
-Maybe I could speak to her.
-No, Merlin. You can't!

05:30.623 --> 05:32.708
Why not? I understand
what she's going through.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.295
You must never
reveal your secret, not to anyone.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.506
-If not me, then someone else.
-Who?

05:38.589 --> 05:41.592
This is a kingdom where Magic is outlawed,
or have you forgotten that?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.136
There are those who still practice it.
What about the Druids?

05:44.220 --> 05:46.263
You said they help
people like this.

05:46.347 --> 05:49.850
Uther has vowed to destroy them.
The Druids cannot help her.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.479
-It would be suicide.
-Then who can?

05:55.814 --> 05:58.317
| will, as I have always done.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.695
Then you need to
be honest with her.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.281
What makes you so certain
that you know better than me?

06:04.365 --> 06:06.742
Because I went through
the same thing.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.415
| know exactly
how she's feeling right now.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.337
You cannot get involved in this.
No good can come of it.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.675
| mean it, Merlin,
stay out of it.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.351
Merlin, I need you to...

06:34.186 --> 06:38.232
-What are you hiding behind your back?
-Nothing. See.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.985
-What're you up to?
-Nothing, honestly.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.197
Arthur, I would never lie to you.
| respect you far too much for that.

06:48.117 --> 06:51.537
-You wanted me to do something?
-My chain mail needs cleaning.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.582
Oh, well,
I'll see to it right away.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.518
How is she?

07:15.436 --> 07:19.148
I've never seen her like this before.
I'm scared to leave her on her own.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.150
Is there anything
| can do to help?

07:22.526 --> 07:23.819
(MORGANA GROANING)

07:25.654 --> 07:27.823

I'll make sure she knows
who they're from.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.255
| can stay, if that would
make you feel better.

07:43.339 --> 07:46.675
-You've done so much already.
- I don't mind.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.219
I'll be fine.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.097

No, he's not here at the moment,
he should be back soon though.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.493
-I need to speak to him! Where is he?
-He's gone to see the king.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.329
What's wrong?

09:03.419 --> 09:07.464
You can trust me, Morgana,
you know you can.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.512
I'm scared, Merlin.

09:15.264 --> 09:19.810
| don't understand anything anymore.
| need to know what's happening.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.356
Please.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.443
Gaius, will be back soon.
He'll be able to help you.

09:27.526 --> 09:31.697
He won't. I don't want any more remedies!
They won't do any good.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.617
It's magic, Merlin.

09:37.828 --> 09:38.787

09:38.871 --> 09:41.540
I'm your friend.
You know I wouldn't make this up.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.042
-Of course.
-Then you believe me?

09:46.128 --> 09:48.380
You think it's magic, too?

to hear someone say it,

why you seek them.

-It would be better if the witch...
-Stop calling her that!

true extent of her powers.

to do that yesterday.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.782
| didn't have time,
| was cleaning the stables.

13:03.033 --> 13:07.829
That's strange, because
a little bird told me you were somewhere else.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.334
Mucking out the stables is strange
and a talking bird isn't?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.586
Merlin, what've we said
about you being funny?

13:14.670 --> 13:16.129
| shouldn't.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.090
So where are my flowers?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.009
Your flowers?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.137
| heard Morgana got some.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.016
| assumed you'd
be putting them in all the rooms.

13:28.100 --> 13:32.229
Or is she the only one to

13:32.312 --> 13:36.733
Yes. Uh, no, no. Uh, what?

13:36.817 --> 13:39.945
It's not a token of anything.
Affection or otherwise.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.573

to hide them from me yesterday?

13:43.657 --> 13:47.452
| wasn't... I mean, I was, I just...
| didn't want you to get the wrong impression.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.122
What's the right impression?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.916
That I was trying to cheer her up
after the fire.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.584
Pick them yourself?

13:56.753 --> 13:57.963
