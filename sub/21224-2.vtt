The Seattle win was big.

a growing concern

is the only one in the NFL

was a team loss.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.891
I don't blame it on Case.

Nor do I give credit to Case

for this win here,
although he contributed

23:16.896 --> 23:18.631
and made a lot of plays
when he needed to.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.901
So we need more production
out of our offense.

to the quarterback position,

it's "sup."
