00:13.958 --> 00:15.250
-<i>Are you ready?</i>
-<i>No.</i>

00:15.875 --> 00:17.291
-<i>Are you ready?</i>
-<i>No.</i>

00:18.291 --> 00:20.500
-<i>Are you ready?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

00:20.583 --> 00:24.250
Okay, the Swiss astronomer
who discovered dark matter was…

00:24.333 --> 00:26.333
-Ferrero Rocher?

00:26.416 --> 00:27.416
No…

00:27.916 --> 00:28.791
No.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.916
This is impossible. Uh…

00:31.000 --> 00:34.708
You said that this was gonna be
the easiest class, and it's not.

00:34.791 --> 00:36.708
The only reason you took this class

00:36.791 --> 00:38.833
is because that really hot girl
was gonna take it.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.250
You know what? Forget finals.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.041
I am a drummer in a band,
and you are a brilliant artist.

00:44.625 --> 00:45.625
Look at this.

00:46.291 --> 00:48.583
You've got a great future
ahead of you, Nat.

00:49.541 --> 00:52.500
Not yet, which is why
I need to graduate with honors…

00:52.583 --> 00:54.958
-Mm-hmm.
-…so I can get my job in LA…

00:55.041 --> 00:56.916
-Mm-hmm.
-…and impress the shit out of my bosses

00:57.000 --> 00:58.833
so I can make my own movies,
that's what I want.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.041
You're gonna do it.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.625
-Yeah.
-'Cause of the five-year plan.

01:01.708 --> 01:04.125
-If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
-Plan to fail.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.041
-Exactly correct.
-Live, love, laugh.

01:06.125 --> 01:08.625
-"Live, laugh, love." We've talked about--
-Live, laugh, love.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.666
Gabe, this is important.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.583
What we're doing right now
is setting us up for our future.

01:13.666 --> 01:14.750
Okay, fine.

01:15.541 --> 01:19.250
But you got the future covered,
so I got the present. Let's go.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.208
-A toast.
-A toast? To what?

01:31.291 --> 01:32.958
Drink first, then I'll tell you.

01:37.083 --> 01:40.125
My band
finally got sponsored for our tour.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.583
Your band got sponsored for your--

01:42.666 --> 01:44.500
-Oh my God! Shit. Sorry.
-Shh!

01:44.583 --> 01:45.875
-Yeah.

01:45.958 --> 01:49.791
See? That's why I'm saying, like,
Nat, we're graduating.

01:49.875 --> 01:52.541
And you're gonna pass, and I'm gonna pass,

01:52.625 --> 01:56.083
and you don't realize that your--
your five-year plan is already in motion.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.000
Mm-hmm.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.791
But we only have this moment once.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.583
The present moment.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.208
-The present moment?
-Mm-hmm.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.833
So what do you suggest we do
to harness this present moment?

02:22.208 --> 02:24.250
This is crazy.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.583
It's batshit.

02:29.458 --> 02:30.958
We're just friends.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.666
-Good friends.
-Yeah.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.625
Very good friends.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.791
And we're so different.

02:36.875 --> 02:39.750
I mean,
we couldn't be more opposite.

02:39.833 --> 02:44.416
I mean, we're not even
attracted to each other, really.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.458
Oh,

02:46.583 --> 02:47.541
that's not true.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.083
Gabe?

02:50.166 --> 02:51.041
Nat?

02:51.958 --> 02:54.541
-Just promise me…
-What?

02:54.625 --> 02:56.791
Promise me this doesn't
have to be a big deal.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.208
What could possibly change?

03:48.833 --> 03:49.791
Hey!

03:52.541 --> 03:53.750
Oh, hey, baby! Hey!

03:53.833 --> 03:55.625
-You got a beer in that bag?
-Save me? What?

03:55.708 --> 03:58.208
-Okay?
-Do you mind? Get off our porch.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.166
You invited me to this party!

04:07.541 --> 04:08.458
Whoa!

04:09.041 --> 04:09.875
Excuse me.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.958
Yeah. They always say,
like, don't try the punch.

04:13.666 --> 04:14.625
Hey, baby, it's me.

04:14.708 --> 04:17.708
Hey, are-- are y'all gonna be done
anytime soon?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.083
You're a dude. Go outside.

04:20.833 --> 04:21.791
Figure it out.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.541
-Hey. How you doin'?

04:28.625 --> 04:31.916
This is not how I envisioned
spending my graduation night.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.625
Okay. So this is if it was 7-Eleven sushi.

04:35.708 --> 04:36.750
Okay.

04:36.833 --> 04:40.250
And then I got-- I got you this…

04:43.250 --> 04:44.625
…as if it…

04:45.833 --> 04:46.833
was not.

04:47.416 --> 04:50.958
-We used a condom, Cara.
-I know. I-- Just to rule it out.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.958
I can't be pregnant.
It's not in our plans.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.166
We're going to LA.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.041
What if I am?

04:57.125 --> 05:00.125
No! I'm pretty positive

05:01.000 --> 05:01.916
you aren't.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.041
Um… Sorry I said "positive."

05:11.125 --> 05:13.208
-Do I just do two at the same time?
-Yeah.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.416
I'd take more than one
just in case one is faulty.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.291
Okay. I'm going in. Don't look.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.125
Did it.

05:29.833 --> 05:30.958
Okay.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.500
Setting a timer for two minutes.

05:39.416 --> 05:40.750
This is scary. Oh my God.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.708
Girl, come on. It's okay. You're fine.

05:42.791 --> 05:45.541
You'll get through this.
We got plans in LA, right?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.291
Deep breath.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.041
It's better if you know. You know?

05:59.333 --> 06:00.916
Oh my God!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.333
-How much time?
-Almost there.

06:05.791 --> 06:08.041
-Everything's gonna be fine.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.166
Yeah. Okay.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.333
-Do it?
-Yeah.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.708
Wh-- what does it say?

06:27.791 --> 06:29.666
Oh God! We're good.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.375
-Thank God.
-Didn't I tell--

06:33.041 --> 06:34.708
I was scared there for a second.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.500
-Could you imagine?
-No!

06:36.583 --> 06:39.250
-Drink.
-No more gas station sushi.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.166
That was f… dumb.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.333
Really dumb.

06:42.416 --> 06:43.416
Cheers, bitch.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.791
Cheers.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.375
-Mm!
-Aah!

06:48.916 --> 06:50.541
-Whoa, that's gross!
-Yeah.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.000
Nat, what is it?

07:01.666 --> 07:03.958
I don't know what to do.

07:09.291 --> 07:10.416
It'll be okay, Nat.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.708
-It's okay.
-What do I do?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.958
-Ugh.
-Mm.

07:17.083 --> 07:17.958
Oh my God.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.291
If you knock one more time…

07:20.875 --> 07:22.166
Mm!

07:22.708 --> 07:24.541
I might screw him.

07:24.625 --> 07:25.458
-Whoo!

07:26.291 --> 07:28.791
You are not pregnant!

07:28.875 --> 07:30.166
Whoo!

07:43.958 --> 07:45.375
I don't know how to do this.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.750
Just text me if you need anything.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.208
-I love you.
-I love you too.

07:52.916 --> 07:53.958
Okay.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.500
I just want-- Like,
did you hear me say that I'm pregnant?

08:23.583 --> 08:26.083
I just wanna make sure you…
heard what I said.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.750
-Yeah, I-- I heard.
-Okay.

08:27.833 --> 08:28.791
I'm just…

08:29.875 --> 08:31.541
-I'm just processing.
-Processing.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
Yeah. Take your time.

08:41.583 --> 08:43.458
We used condoms. We did everything right.

08:43.541 --> 08:44.916
-I know.
-It shouldn't happen to us.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.541
-This happens to other people.
-I know.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.583
We shouldn't be in this situation.
Damn it.

08:49.750 --> 08:50.833
Hmm.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.833
Oh God.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.500
-I'm sorry.
No.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.541
I just--
I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.000
-I don't know.
-Me too.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.041
-I don't know what to say. I just…
-Me too.

09:21.541 --> 09:22.958
Listen, um…

09:26.958 --> 09:28.583
This should be your choice.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.750
It is… It <i>is </i>your choice.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.541
Hmm?

09:36.125 --> 09:39.041
I don't mean that as a cop-out
because, obviously, it affects me.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.791
And I support you
with whatever you choose.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.458
I'm pro-your-choice.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.500
-Thank you.
I mean it.

09:53.416 --> 09:55.125
-I mean it.
-I know.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.208
I think I'm gonna have this baby.

10:20.458 --> 10:21.416
Okay.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.041
So you and Gabe…

10:28.125 --> 10:29.416
He was really…

10:31.958 --> 10:34.083
supportive and-- and

10:35.541 --> 10:37.041
understanding.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.500
-Mm-hmm.
-We're obviously not gonna be a couple,

10:39.583 --> 10:44.125
but he wants to help,
and I could really use that right now.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.083
Just for a while.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.750
I don't know how to explain it.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.250
It's just, it feels like
this is something…

10:57.083 --> 10:59.166
…that I have to do.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.166
Like this is what was supposed to happen.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.208
-So, obviously, I can't go to LA.
-Oh…

11:10.291 --> 11:11.791
I mean, it's okay.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.583
I'm…

11:14.208 --> 11:16.875
-I'm not gonna go either, obviously.
-No. You're going to LA.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.125
-You're going to LA.
-I-- I can't leave you here.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.291
-Yes. You can go to--
-I can't go to LA by myself.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.958
Yes, you can.
If anyone can do it, it's you.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.125
-Nat.
-You worked

11:30.250 --> 11:32.833
so hard for this.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.625
And you have
that advertising job lined up. Remember?

11:43.791 --> 11:45.166
So you're gonna go.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.291
And don't worry about me.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.083
I can still draw, one way or another.
I'll figure it out.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.041
Okay?

11:57.583 --> 11:58.625
Okay.

12:12.958 --> 12:15.208
I'm going to miss you!

12:17.125 --> 12:18.916
-Hey!
-I guess the next time I'll see you

12:19.000 --> 12:20.916
is when
you're playing at the Hollywood Bowl.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.666
Oh! Or worst case, the Wiltern.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.166
-Yeah, worst case.

12:24.958 --> 12:26.958
-Thank you for helping me.
-Yes.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.375
Okay, call me as soon as you…

12:33.208 --> 12:35.708
-I'll miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you too, Gabe.

12:36.416 --> 12:37.666
-Okay.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.541
-I'm gonna visit.
-Yeah, I know that.

12:40.125 --> 12:40.958
Use your blinkers.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.791
-Watch out when you merge.
-I will.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.458
Cara!

12:46.958 --> 12:47.791
See you.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.625
Oh, hey!

12:53.750 --> 12:54.791
Bye.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.708
Bye.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.666
Okay.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.958
Buckle up, bitch.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.250
-Later!

13:46.583 --> 13:47.625
Oh yeah.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.000
-Is that Nat?
-Huh?

13:50.083 --> 13:53.333
Let's just ease into it.
I'll find the right time to tell them.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.916
-Yeah.
-Is that okay?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.041
-Mm-hmm. Sounds good.
-Cool.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.625
Hi! Honey, what are you doing here?

13:58.708 --> 14:00.375
-I thought you were on your way to LA.
-Hey!

14:00.458 --> 14:01.333
Hi, Gabe!

14:01.416 --> 14:02.833
-It's great to see ya.
-I'm pregnant.

14:03.416 --> 14:04.250
What?

14:04.750 --> 14:05.750
Him?

14:12.708 --> 14:15.375
Can we… talk about it?

14:17.958 --> 14:21.291
I didn't-- I didn't even know
that you guys were a thing.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.416
We're not.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.333
Oh, great!

14:24.416 --> 14:26.166
Yeah, no, we're just friends, mostly.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.083
-Uh-huh.
-Um…

14:27.166 --> 14:29.041
Every day, except one day. Uh…

14:29.125 --> 14:31.375
It was a night, really.
Just-- It was half a night.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.708
-Good Lord!
-Stop. Gabe!

14:32.791 --> 14:33.750
Wow!

14:34.291 --> 14:36.333
I'm still trying to figure this out.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.916
I'm trying to make
the best decision here.

14:39.000 --> 14:39.958
-Right.
-Moving forward.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.916
I-- I know you guys are very happy

14:42.000 --> 14:45.250
-with your empty nest that you've had…
-It's been great.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.625
…and you've been enjoying that.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.458
But could I possibly

14:50.083 --> 14:51.166
come home?

14:52.375 --> 14:53.291
Hmm.

14:53.958 --> 14:56.208
What about your goals?
What about moving to LA?

14:56.291 --> 14:58.875
-What about--
-You just got your degree, Nattie.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.833
That's everything you'd worked towards
since you were a little girl.

15:01.916 --> 15:05.500
-Everything you dreamed about.
-I'm still gonna work in animation, Dad.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.750
-Some-- Someh--Ye-- I am!
-I mean--

15:07.833 --> 15:10.500
It's just being put on pause
for a-- a minute.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.583
Wha…

15:11.666 --> 15:14.166
What-- what did you study again, Gabe?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.416
-History.
-History?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.333
Oh!

15:18.416 --> 15:21.083
Yeah, I'm still obviously trying
to figure out what to do with that.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.583
Stop. Gabe.

15:26.166 --> 15:29.583
But, um, I'm planning to work as a… uh…

15:29.666 --> 15:33.708
Keep my job in dry cleaning, and, um…
throughout the summer, between gigs.

15:33.791 --> 15:36.875
-Gigs?
-I'm also a… a drummer in a band.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.000
Drummers…

15:38.083 --> 15:39.541
So, a musician.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.750
Does that pay?

15:44.583 --> 15:45.708
Uh…

15:45.791 --> 15:46.875
Not yet.

15:46.958 --> 15:49.666
Then you're not a musician.
You're a dry cleaner.

15:49.750 --> 15:53.041
And now you got us on spin cycle,
don't you, pal?

15:53.125 --> 15:56.833
No, you can't do that. You can't tell him
to give up on his dream.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.875
-You've gotta give up yours. Why can't…
-I'm not--

15:58.958 --> 16:01.458
-I'm not giving up my dream!
-With all due respect, Ms. Bennett--

16:01.541 --> 16:03.875
-No, I'm not!
-…I'm gonna be doing my share.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.250
Your share?
I think you've already done your share!

16:06.333 --> 16:09.833
-You can't have this judgmental attitude.
-Your share has been accomplished!

16:09.916 --> 16:12.416
-We're trying to come to you…
-You think we're gonna be like…

16:12.500 --> 16:14.833
-What conversation did you think--
-Hold on. Tina, just…

16:14.916 --> 16:18.583
Guys, just hold on. We've all got
a lot of feelings right now, okay?

16:18.666 --> 16:22.875
Your mother and I, in particular,
towards this… young gentleman…

16:22.958 --> 16:24.458
-And you.
-I know.

16:24.541 --> 16:27.708
I think the best thing
that can be done at this moment

16:27.791 --> 16:30.833
is for you and I
to take a few deep breaths.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.416
We're gonna take a moment.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.541
-Step outside onto the porch.
-Seriously?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.041
-Yeah, I'm serious. Come on.
-Okay.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.875
-Wow.
-I think it's the best thing to do.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.541
Did we not teach her about safe sex?

16:46.625 --> 16:48.458
-Not show her how to put on a condom?
-We did.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.500
We did. We taught her about condoms.
I remember the conversation.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.625
She was 15. I was sweating.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.083
They were just not expecting it
to play out that way.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.250
They weren't ex--

16:57.333 --> 17:00.041
-I wasn't expecting… this.
-…to do?

17:00.125 --> 17:03.250
-I did not see…
-Why are you okay with this?

17:03.333 --> 17:07.375
-…"single, unemployed, 22-year-old mom"…
-Why are you not freaking out?

17:07.458 --> 17:10.916
…on my tarot card reading
that Cara gave me last month.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.708
What about our plans?

17:13.791 --> 17:15.166
What about naked Sundays?

17:15.250 --> 17:17.875
-And furniture with sharp edges?

17:17.958 --> 17:19.791
-We were going to Barcelona next year.
-Hey--

17:19.875 --> 17:22.250
I've been thinking
about that quite a bit.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.291
It would make sense if…

17:25.833 --> 17:28.750
-What?
-If you and I just…

17:29.500 --> 17:32.166
I need a therapist right now,
but naked Sundays…

17:32.250 --> 17:34.208
-If, um…
-They're not gonna be on--

17:34.291 --> 17:35.250
Oh, no. Uh-uh.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.791
-Let's get married.
-Nope!

17:36.875 --> 17:39.250
-Nuh-uh! No! Get up! That's not happening!
-! Hey!

17:39.333 --> 17:40.750
-Hey! Hey!
-Get up!

17:40.833 --> 17:43.583
-He's not talking to you!
-You better be praying. Get up. Sit.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.916
-I've thought a lot since last night--
-Oh, a well-thought-out decision.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.791
They've been thinking about this all--
Since last night.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.250
-Sorry. I thought it was a rash decision.
-We'll go back out.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.083
I thought this was a quick thing.
Like, "We're having a ba--"

17:57.166 --> 17:59.916
-No, they thought for four to six hours.
-It's okay. Use your head!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.875
I don't know why
you're being so weird about this, Rick.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.041
-They clearly have this under control.

18:12.416 --> 18:13.333
What? Uh…

18:14.333 --> 18:16.583
-It's not as thought out as it could be.
-Gabe.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.458
-We're still figuring things out.
-Gabe.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.125
-You know? Yeah…
-I know.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.958
You're gonna be such a good dad.

18:25.583 --> 18:30.375
And if I'm gonna be in this situation
with anyone, I'm glad that it's with you.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.666
Really.

18:32.916 --> 18:33.875
You know?

18:35.083 --> 18:38.791
But you wanna marry someone
that you're in love with. I know you do.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.416
Right? Obviously.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.625
Right?

18:42.500 --> 18:43.416
Right.

18:44.916 --> 18:45.833
Yeah.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.958
Thank you, though.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.416
Whoo!

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
LA! LA sign! We did it! We made it!

18:57.583 --> 19:00.083
-Oh my God!

19:00.166 --> 19:02.333
-We're here!
-What's up, California?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.125
-Oh my God.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.291
-Look!

19:15.416 --> 19:18.000
Look, plastic surgery!

19:18.083 --> 19:18.958
Oh!

19:22.958 --> 19:23.958
Is it this one?

19:24.875 --> 19:27.166
-This one, this one, this one!
-Um…

19:28.250 --> 19:29.625
-Is it this beautiful one?
-Wait!

19:31.750 --> 19:34.041
Oh my God. Oh my God.

19:34.125 --> 19:35.541
Wait. Wait.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.791
Oh, no.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.291
It's 448.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.041
We're 449.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.000
Oh.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.166
Well, that's cute.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.333
-That's cute.
-Yeah!

19:51.458 --> 19:53.791
-None of these jobs pay.
-Mm.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.000
Literally none of them.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.791
Unpaid mentorship.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.583
Unpaid internship. They're all…

20:00.375 --> 20:02.500
-How am I supposed to make money?
-Mm.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.958
How is anyone supposed to make money?
You just have to be rich to be an artist?

20:06.041 --> 20:09.000
-Yes. This is America. So…

20:11.375 --> 20:13.000
No. Oh my God.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.625
Lucy Galloway is looking for an assistant.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.041
Wait, isn't that, um…

20:17.125 --> 20:18.000
Uh…

20:18.083 --> 20:21.708
Yes. She's the head honcho at Tall Story,

20:21.791 --> 20:25.250
and she's my idol, and I'm obsessed
with everything she's ever done.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.000
-And she's hiring?
-Yes.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.166
Would you look at God? You have to apply.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.458
-This is his work.
-I don't have the qualifications.

20:32.541 --> 20:36.041
I guarantee you there are 20 way less
qualified men that are gonna apply.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.833
For sure, but I don't… Eee…

20:38.916 --> 20:41.375
If you don't apply…
I'm gonna scream.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.041
Please don't. We just got here.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.583
Don't. Cara.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.791
-Don't-- Okay, I'm…

20:47.333 --> 20:49.666
Fine. I'll apply. I'm not gonna get it.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.750
-It's gonna be embarrassing.
-Don't say that! Don't be negative!

20:52.833 --> 20:55.166
-I'm just being realistic.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.125
Résumé, done. Applied. Moving on.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.458
Did you not… like, personalize it
with a cover letter or something?

21:01.541 --> 21:04.000
What? You didn't tell me to do that.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.125
It's not even six in the morning.
What are you doing?

21:24.208 --> 21:25.250
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.416
Are we disturbing you?

21:27.916 --> 21:32.833
Is it difficult to have
someone suddenly invade your space?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.958
-Sorry.
-Job applications today.

21:36.833 --> 21:37.666
Right.

21:37.750 --> 21:41.500
Oh, and you also got that OGBT, MD…

21:42.208 --> 21:43.625
The-- the doctor.

21:43.708 --> 21:45.708
-That… Yeah.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.458
So that's 20 minutes for me, is that?

21:49.541 --> 21:53.041
Yeah. I'll check you as done.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.000
Okay.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.000
Get some rest. You look great, okay?

21:59.583 --> 22:01.375
I'm not sorry we woke you up.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.250
Good morning, good morning!

22:05.333 --> 22:08.708
<i>The radio station for all your</i>
<i>needs, covering Pasadena, Los Angeles…</i>

22:08.791 --> 22:09.916
-Hey, Nat?
-Mm?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.791
-What time is it?
-49.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.291
Shit. Okay.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.625
So Lucy Galloway
is having an event tonight.

22:17.708 --> 22:21.250
-Mm-hmm.
-I wonder if maybe I could just show up.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.666
-You should go. Why not, right?
-Is that weird?

22:24.750 --> 22:26.291
No. It shows initiative.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.291
Besides, you haven't had
a response to the other résumés.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.500
-Yes. Thank you. Um…
-Oh, this.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.041
-Mm.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.083
What's this?

22:38.166 --> 22:40.166
For your first day in advertising.

22:41.291 --> 22:42.583
You'll be great.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.583
I love it.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.125
I'm proud of you.

22:48.791 --> 22:49.791
Thanks.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.166
I love you the most.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.666
Hey.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.166
You're gonna find a job.

22:57.666 --> 22:59.916
You are. You're gonna be okay.

23:00.875 --> 23:01.958
Mm-hmm.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.125
-All right. I love you.
-I love you.

23:04.625 --> 23:05.500
Bye.

23:05.583 --> 23:06.583
Bye.

23:22.291 --> 23:23.458
Hmm?

23:26.458 --> 23:28.208
Natalie? We're ready for you.

23:30.166 --> 23:32.375
All right.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.166
Okay.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.291
Hi. Uh, the Tall Story party?

24:00.041 --> 24:02.875
-In the back. They have a list.
-Okay. Thank you.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.791
Oh, hey. Hi. Can I grab a…

24:05.875 --> 24:07.291
Yeah… If you wanna…

24:07.375 --> 24:09.208
-Stay in this area.
-Check it out.

24:09.875 --> 24:10.750
Sorry.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.541
Oh, okay.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.833
-Hi. I work here.
-Yeah.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.875
-Oh, thanks, pal.
-Sure.

24:22.958 --> 24:23.875
Excuse me.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.625
Excuse me.

24:30.458 --> 24:31.833
-Hello?
-Hayden.

24:31.916 --> 24:32.875
Yeah.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.166
-What's up, man?
-What do you want?

24:37.666 --> 24:39.958
Oh, you don't have to buy me a drink.

24:40.041 --> 24:41.458
I was-- I wasn't buying you a drink.

24:41.541 --> 24:45.125
-I was just introducing you to Hayden.
-Oh! Okay.

24:45.916 --> 24:49.125
Uh, can I just get a tequila?
The cheapest is fine.

24:49.208 --> 24:50.750
-Thank you.
-Sure. Cool.

24:52.333 --> 24:53.208
You an actress?

24:53.875 --> 24:56.083
No! Are you?

24:57.125 --> 24:58.083
Yes.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.041
Are you supposed to be in the, uh…
in the event?

25:03.125 --> 25:04.208
Um, kind of.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.083
I'm trying to…

25:07.625 --> 25:10.708
There's a woman in there.
I applied for a job with her.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.750
You-- you applied for a job?

25:12.833 --> 25:15.666
I applied for a job
with a woman who's in there.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.000
-Lucy Galloway.
-So you're stalking a potential employer.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.708
-No! No!
-That's a bold move.

25:19.791 --> 25:21.458
-I'm impressed. What's your play?
-I--

25:21.541 --> 25:22.541
No!

25:23.458 --> 25:24.833
I'm just trying…

25:25.750 --> 25:28.083
Look, I'm trying
to take advantage of a situation.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.208
I just moved here.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.750
You have to know people in this town,
and I don't know anyone.

25:32.833 --> 25:36.916
So I was gonna… try to get in.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.458
-You don't seem to be trying that hard.
-Well, because there's a man with a list.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.458
There's probably 100 names on that list.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.916
He doesn't know whether you came out
to use the bathroom or get a drink.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.625
So, come on.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.791
I just walk by him and smile and

25:52.791 --> 25:54.791
pretend like I know where I'm going?

26:01.750 --> 26:02.583
Okay.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.333
Okay.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.416
Thank you.

26:21.291 --> 26:22.958
Yeah, I know!

26:28.291 --> 26:30.208
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.250
I saw your latest project.

26:43.833 --> 26:44.958
This one's on me.

26:45.625 --> 26:46.916
-Well done.
-Oh.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.583
Never doubted you for a second.
I'm Jake, by the way.

26:51.250 --> 26:52.083
Thank you.

26:52.166 --> 26:53.583
-Natalie.
-Natalie.

26:53.666 --> 26:57.166
So, Natalie, what's this, uh…
what's this job you're after?

26:57.250 --> 27:00.166
Um… Assistant to Lucy.

27:00.250 --> 27:04.708
She's my idol
and my favorite character designer.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.708
-These?
Yeah.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.083
Impressive. Tall Story Animation.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.166
Well, we're in. We made it.

27:12.791 --> 27:14.958
Play it cool. Eyes on the prize.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.833
Where's this lady at? You see her?

27:19.500 --> 27:20.916
Um…

27:24.708 --> 27:26.666
-Yeah, it's obviously--
-Excuse me?

27:26.750 --> 27:28.333
Is Lucy Galloway here?

27:29.375 --> 27:30.875
She doesn't come to these things.

27:35.416 --> 27:38.791
Okay. Well, she's not here.
So that was a waste of time.

27:38.875 --> 27:42.000
-Thank you for this. Good night.
-Hang on. You're not leaving.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.041
-Yeah.
-We just-- We just got in.

27:44.125 --> 27:48.041
She's not here. So I need to go home
and send out more résumés.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.041
-Right now?
-Yeah.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.333
Okay. Well… well, we're here.

27:54.791 --> 27:56.291
At least steal some food.

27:56.958 --> 27:59.000
I'm not gonna steal food.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.250
What do they have?

28:01.333 --> 28:03.916
<i>I'm doing all right, you know.</i>
<i>LA's not the same without you,</i>

28:04.000 --> 28:07.500
<i>but I'm doing my best</i>
<i>to live the dream for both of us.</i>

28:07.583 --> 28:10.250
<i>I found someone to take your room.</i>
<i>She's cool.</i>

28:10.750 --> 28:13.791
<i>And I start that new job tomorrow.</i>
<i>Any advice?</i>

28:13.875 --> 28:16.875
Maybe just don't be late for work.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.333
<i>Mm. Good idea.</i>

28:18.833 --> 28:19.666
Yeah.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.916
<i>Hey, Nat. Did you know that</i>
<i>everyone in LA has a job title</i>,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.500
<i>like they're on </i>TheBachelor?

28:25.125 --> 28:25.958
No.

28:26.041 --> 28:27.916
<i>Yeah, well, I met this girl last night</i>

28:28.000 --> 28:30.333
<i>who said she was</i>
<i>a supervisor for gifted youth.</i>

28:30.416 --> 28:32.125
Um, I don't know what that means.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.208
<i>Yeah, I didn't either.</i>

28:33.291 --> 28:36.625
<i>Apparently, she's just the nanny</i>
<i>for some celebrity's kids.</i>

28:37.375 --> 28:39.708
<i>Oh, LA is so weird.</i>

28:40.375 --> 28:42.000
<i>Anyway, how are you?</i>

28:43.333 --> 28:44.625
Um…

28:46.333 --> 28:48.916
I'm kinda terrible, actually.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Um…

28:50.666 --> 28:55.541
Yesterday, I just basically ate crackers
and took three naps,

28:55.625 --> 28:59.000
and then threw up for the rest of the day.

28:59.625 --> 29:03.000
<i>-Oh, honey, I'm sorry.</i>

29:04.000 --> 29:05.833
<i>I mean, that's normal, right?</i>

29:05.916 --> 29:06.958
-Yeah.
-It…

29:07.583 --> 29:09.208
<i>It's part of the process.</i>

29:09.916 --> 29:11.458
<i>I'm sure it'll get better.</i>

29:12.166 --> 29:14.333
<i>-Hey, have you been drawing much?</i>

29:16.291 --> 29:17.916
<i>-Nat?</i>
-No.

29:20.416 --> 29:21.541
<i>Oh… </i>

29:22.125 --> 29:23.291
Can I, um…

29:24.708 --> 29:29.375
can I just call you back later
so I can cry on this couch by myself?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.166
<i>Yeah, course.</i>

29:31.250 --> 29:33.750
<i>-I'm here if you need anything.</i>
Okay. Okay, I love you.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.541
<i>-I love you.</i>
-Bye.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.250
Oh…

29:57.791 --> 29:58.625
Hello?

29:58.708 --> 30:00.708
<i>Hi. Natalie Bennett?</i>

30:00.791 --> 30:04.416
-This is she.
<i>-Hi, I'm calling about your application.</i>

30:04.500 --> 30:07.541
<i>Are you free this afternoon or tomorrow</i>
<i>to come in?</i>

30:08.250 --> 30:09.208
Yeah.

30:09.708 --> 30:10.666
<i>Great. Uh…</i>

30:22.500 --> 30:26.333
-Natalie. Hi.

30:26.416 --> 30:27.500
Hi…

30:27.583 --> 30:30.291
I found your résumé, and I had Hannah
put it at the top of the pile.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.375
-Jake.
-Um… uh, yeah.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.000
Yeah, you remember. That's so sweet.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.125
You work here.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.750
Yeah. The fact that you studied both
2D and 3D animation is your selling point.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.208
You gotta lead with that.
Do you know how to roll calls?

30:42.375 --> 30:44.916
Don't answer that.
When she asks you, the answer is "yes."

30:45.000 --> 30:47.541
Why did you not tell me
that you worked here?

30:47.625 --> 30:50.541
Ah, it didn't come up. I don't know.
I thought you might be nuts.

30:51.791 --> 30:55.791
You thought I might be nuts? You knew,
hey, that Lucy wasn't even in there.

30:55.875 --> 30:57.333
Of course I knew
Lucy wasn't in there.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
You can't just accost a major player
at an event.

31:00.083 --> 31:03.833
It's like-- like a valet handing Spielberg
his screenplay along with his car keys.

31:03.916 --> 31:05.000
Accosting her…

31:05.083 --> 31:07.875
Well… I didn't know
what you were gonna do.

31:07.958 --> 31:10.625
Look, the point is,
there aren't many people in this town

31:10.708 --> 31:13.833
who would rather print out résumés
on a Friday night than hang at a party.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.416
-Hmm.
-That's why you're here.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.125
Nice blazer. Don't wear it.
You're not a real estate agent.

31:20.208 --> 31:22.708
-Natalie?

31:22.791 --> 31:23.958
-Uh…
-You ready?

31:24.041 --> 31:25.666
Yes. Weird.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.458
You're just my idol. I've…

31:35.958 --> 31:37.833
I just love everything that you've
ever done.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.375
-Shh.
-You're such an--

31:39.958 --> 31:41.416
Talking too much.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.750
Mm…

31:47.708 --> 31:48.791
Hmm.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.000
Very interesting.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.458
Can I borrow your face?

32:00.500 --> 32:02.916
Mm… What? My face?

32:06.166 --> 32:09.166
Okay. Uh… Why don't we try happy?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.958
Gleeful!

32:12.458 --> 32:13.791
Why don't you try anger?

32:13.875 --> 32:15.166
-Anger?
-Yeah.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.458
What about confused?

32:19.166 --> 32:21.916
-I'm so sorry. Who are you?
-Natalie Bennett.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.791
-Natalie Bennett.
-Yes.

32:24.458 --> 32:28.791
Natalie Bennett
with a paper folded résumé.

32:29.666 --> 32:33.541
Okay, so you studied 3D?

32:34.958 --> 32:36.458
-And 2D.
-Mm.

32:36.541 --> 32:38.625
I'm actually more of an illustrator.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.666
So what was that,
some sort of hybrid situation?

32:41.750 --> 32:44.000
-No, I doubled.
-Oh.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.416
After doing my research,

32:45.500 --> 32:49.500
I figured that I'd have a better shot
at getting a job if I knew how to do both.

32:49.583 --> 32:54.083
And, um… it's not like 3D
is devoid of illustration these days.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.666
You have <i>Spider-Verse, Paperman…</i>

32:58.041 --> 33:00.625
New draft is in.
They wanna discuss it for--

33:00.708 --> 33:02.791
-Sorry.
-Oh my God. You're Shay Tanzie.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.125
Oh, I was just-- I was just gonna say

33:05.208 --> 33:08.750
I loved your homage to Fiver
in <i>Rabbit Lost.</i>

33:08.833 --> 33:11.750
It was… beautiful.

33:11.833 --> 33:12.666
Thanks.

33:12.750 --> 33:16.041
And you got Tucker
to do the background work on that, yeah?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.541
Uh… Mm-hmm.

33:17.625 --> 33:18.750
Amazing.

33:19.875 --> 33:20.791
Who's this?

33:20.875 --> 33:22.333
Natalie Bennett.

33:23.416 --> 33:24.791
She's here for the job.

33:25.458 --> 33:26.500
Oh.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.916
Uh, can you roll calls?

33:30.250 --> 33:31.166
Yes.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.458
Here you go.

33:54.125 --> 33:57.458
And that's it? It's so fast.

33:57.541 --> 34:01.208
-Well, it's strong. Just listen.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.166
-Wanna know if it's a boy or a girl?
-Is it a boy or a girl?

34:09.541 --> 34:10.750
It's a little girl.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.875
-Girl!

34:41.416 --> 34:42.666
Oh!

34:47.000 --> 34:49.833
-Ugh! Cara! Roach! Roach!

34:56.875 --> 34:58.916
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.666
Happy New Year!

35:00.750 --> 35:02.291
It's gonna be a great one!

35:02.375 --> 35:03.500
Happy New Year!

35:12.250 --> 35:14.375
First year's torture for everybody.

35:14.458 --> 35:17.041
It's long days, late nights.
Very little sleep.

35:17.125 --> 35:19.625
Did you have a social life
that you liked before this?

35:19.708 --> 35:21.083
-Not really.
-Very good.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.750
That would never have survived.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.166
It's like having a child, basically. Um…

35:25.250 --> 35:28.708
Keep your head down, eyes on the prize.
Soon, you'll have your own assistant.

35:29.291 --> 35:30.958
Have you always wanted
to work in animation?

35:31.041 --> 35:33.041
Honestly, no. Nothing against animation.

35:33.125 --> 35:36.416
But, um… I think
it's more of a stepping-stone for me.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.083
-Uh-huh.
-Um, I moved around a lot as a kid.

35:39.166 --> 35:42.291
Met a lot of interesting people.
A lot of weird places.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.458
Mm.

35:43.541 --> 35:46.125
Eventually, what I wanna do
is kinda tell those stories.

35:46.208 --> 35:48.875
I don't know whether
it's narrative or documentary, but, um…

35:49.875 --> 35:52.333
that's what I wanna-- what I wanna do,
is tell those stories.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.166
What about you?

35:54.250 --> 35:57.333
Um… I stayed in the same place growing up.

35:57.416 --> 36:00.250
That's why I moved to LA,
so I could have those experiences.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.708
That's why I'm at this job.

36:02.916 --> 36:04.500
You're in the perfect position.

36:04.583 --> 36:08.208
For me, I think it's a slightly smaller
part of the five-year plan.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.000
The five-year plan?

36:12.083 --> 36:16.166
What's the quote? "If you fail to plan,
you should plan to fail."

36:16.250 --> 36:17.416
Oh!

36:18.000 --> 36:19.750
-What?

36:21.208 --> 36:22.625
I can't believe you just said that.

36:23.208 --> 36:24.666
I didn't. Benjamin Franklin said it.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.791
But I used to say that all the time,

36:27.875 --> 36:30.000
and I would get so much shit for it.

36:30.083 --> 36:32.958
For quoting Benjamin Franklin
or for having a five-year plan?

36:33.041 --> 36:34.708
-For both.
-I don't understand that.

36:34.791 --> 36:37.458
-Why would anybody give you shit--
-I don't know!

36:37.541 --> 36:39.500
What is it?
What do people have against planning?

36:39.583 --> 36:41.583
What <i>do </i>people have against planning?

36:41.666 --> 36:43.791
I think it's great that
you have a five-year plan.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.833
-Me too.
-Cheers to five-year plans.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.750
To five-year plans.

36:51.625 --> 36:54.208
-What? I hate these books!

36:54.291 --> 36:55.166
These books suck.

36:55.250 --> 36:57.791
Everyone says something different.
How do you know?

36:57.875 --> 36:59.750
How do you know which one to follow?

36:59.833 --> 37:02.041
-Uh…
-Eeeh! Oooh…

37:02.125 --> 37:03.916
-What's up?
-She's kicking a lot.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.041
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.541
Oh, wow!

37:07.791 --> 37:10.250
I think I'm having contractions.

37:10.333 --> 37:12.500
-What? Right now? That's-- Are you sure?
-Yeah.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.958
-I'm scared we're gonna screw this up.
-Okay.

37:15.041 --> 37:17.458
-We're gonna screw it up.
-Of course. That's unavoidable, but…

37:17.541 --> 37:18.708
-Oh shit.

37:18.791 --> 37:20.208
Your parents screwed you up, right?

37:20.291 --> 37:21.791
-My parents screwed me up.
-Yeah!

37:21.875 --> 37:23.083
Their parents screwed them up.

37:23.166 --> 37:25.083
That's the cycle
of people screwing each other up.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.541
-Okay.
-Ooh…

37:32.625 --> 37:33.541
Oh, oh, oh!

37:33.625 --> 37:36.583
We should stop at, um…
a Whataburger on the way.

37:36.666 --> 37:38.416
-For what?
-Because I need to eat.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.166
-They're not gonna let me eat there.
-That's probably for a reason.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.291
No! I'm about to push a baby
out of my vag,

37:43.375 --> 37:46.083
and I'm gonna do it
after eating a buffalo chicken sandwich.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.833
-Let's go!
-Okay. All right. Aah!

37:48.916 --> 37:49.958
Aah…

37:52.666 --> 37:54.000
Oh my God! My parents!

37:54.583 --> 37:56.500
I'm gonna call them. Don't worry.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.333
Um… This way.

38:01.416 --> 38:02.333
-This way? Okay.
-Yeah.

38:02.416 --> 38:04.458
-Did they stop at Whataburger?

38:04.541 --> 38:05.708
-Huh?
-That's my girl!

38:06.458 --> 38:09.625
Yeah, she's havin' major contractions,
but you're doin' a great job.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.833
We're makin' it happen.
This is how you do it.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.666
-You don't panic.
-Here we go.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.875
You make things happen.
Guys? Come on. Hey, guys.

38:16.958 --> 38:18.291
-Rick!
-Yeah?

38:18.375 --> 38:20.833
Hey, you gotta
keep me posted on this stuff.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.750
-Here-- Oh, here it comes.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.916
Okay, it's gonna-- Here it comes.

38:25.541 --> 38:27.208
Breathe it through. Try to breathe.

38:27.291 --> 38:29.625
Do you want me to get you
a juice box or a water?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.291
-Okay.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.541
Oh, hey, quick question.

38:33.625 --> 38:36.375
Or forget it. Very busy. Sorry.

38:36.458 --> 38:40.041
I just realized I gotta relearn
all those lullabies I used to sing you.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.333
-I remember that.
-Yeah.

38:42.416 --> 38:44.166
-You're doin' great.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.416
Nine,

38:47.041 --> 38:49.375
-eight…

38:49.458 --> 38:50.375
…seven…

38:52.083 --> 38:54.875
All right.
You're not goin' down, are you, Dad?

38:54.958 --> 38:56.458
No, I'm good. I'm good.

38:56.541 --> 38:59.458
-Okay. Five…
-I'm good. You got it. There you go.

38:59.541 --> 39:00.541
…four…

39:00.625 --> 39:01.666
There we go. Good.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.750
-Oh! All done!
-I-- Oh!

39:08.208 --> 39:09.958
Good job, Mom!

39:10.500 --> 39:11.791
Here you go, Mom.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.500
Hi, baby.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.541
-Hi, baby!

39:16.083 --> 39:17.291
Hi, baby!

39:20.583 --> 39:21.791
Hi, Rosie.

39:29.958 --> 39:31.208
-Hey!
-Hi.

39:32.583 --> 39:37.416
Um, do you have
any kids experience, by chance?

39:37.500 --> 39:38.875
No!

39:39.583 --> 39:41.333
Okay. Doesn't matter. Come with me.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.000
-What did you do?
-Oh my God!

39:46.625 --> 39:48.625
Uh, well, it's my birthday.

39:49.791 --> 39:50.833
Happy birthday.

39:51.416 --> 39:52.333
Thank you.

39:53.041 --> 39:55.250
And I wanted to pet one for my birthday.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.166
Okay.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.625
The other ones got jealous,
so I had to pet them too.

39:58.708 --> 40:00.291
You let them all out of the crate?

40:00.375 --> 40:02.375
-Yes, I did. That's what happened.
-Yeah.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.500
-I think it--
-They're eating the storyboards.

40:04.583 --> 40:07.500
-Oh my God, they are. Wow. Okay. Um…

40:08.416 --> 40:11.625
All right, you get the storyboards.
I will handle…

40:11.708 --> 40:13.166
I happen to be great with kids.

40:13.250 --> 40:15.250
-You go first.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.750
I leave you alone for five minutes.

40:17.833 --> 40:21.083
-You get up on the table.
-Excuse me. Aah… Pardon me.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.541
Hi, buddy. Oh, sorry.
Not what I had in mind.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.958
No, no, no. No, no, no.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.666
-This thing does not want to stop. Aah!
-They've run amok.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.708
-They're eating the things.
-Come on, guys. Just chase 'em away.

40:30.791 --> 40:33.541
-Excuse me. Go! Hey, hey, hey.
-You're doing great. You're a natural.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.083
Put your face on his face.

40:36.166 --> 40:39.291
I dare you.
Put your face on his face. It's so soft.

40:39.791 --> 40:41.916
Aw!

40:43.750 --> 40:46.041
Oh! Shh!

40:46.125 --> 40:49.250
-Sh, sh, sh!

40:51.166 --> 40:52.833
-Oh, baby.
-Hey.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.000
Oh no!

40:55.083 --> 40:57.250
-It's up her back.
-Take her to the tub, please.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.625
-Sh, sh, sh.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.833
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Whoa!

41:04.916 --> 41:08.833
Gabe, you're gonna wanna point
the explosive end away from you, okay?

41:08.916 --> 41:11.250
Can you give me a hand?
I can't reach the--

41:11.333 --> 41:12.541
If you can believe it,

41:12.625 --> 41:14.708
these are the moments
you're gonna miss the most.

41:14.791 --> 41:16.666
Good night.

41:20.333 --> 41:21.166
Goats?

41:21.250 --> 41:23.041
-There were a lot of them.
-Why?

41:23.125 --> 41:27.250
Because it was Jake's birthday.
He wanted to let them out and pet them.

41:27.333 --> 41:28.875
It was really cute.

41:29.625 --> 41:33.708
Can I come work with you, meet Jake?
It sounds like you guys have fun.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.500
-I hate my job.

41:36.583 --> 41:37.708
Shh!

41:38.208 --> 41:39.083
Wha--

41:39.916 --> 41:40.916
Hello?

41:42.125 --> 41:44.166
You are so loud!

41:45.250 --> 41:46.583
You are so loud!

41:46.666 --> 41:49.458
-Also, this is not a library!

41:49.541 --> 41:50.416
Well--

41:53.750 --> 41:54.750
-Here! Pretend!
-What--

41:56.333 --> 41:57.791
Oh my God!

41:58.916 --> 42:02.208
Hey! I'm keeping this book.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.125
You!

42:08.208 --> 42:09.041
No, no.

42:09.125 --> 42:12.333
I'm not going to sleep
because I'm your night owl.

42:13.708 --> 42:15.583
-What else? You nocturnal?

42:16.375 --> 42:17.958
Yeah, you're nocturnal?

42:18.541 --> 42:20.625
And-- and you got business to biz

42:20.708 --> 42:23.000
-and-- and papers to file.

42:23.083 --> 42:27.250
-Oh, what else you gotta do?
-What else you gotta do, little night owl?

42:28.625 --> 42:30.208
-Little night owl, you got…
-Aww…

42:31.583 --> 42:34.666
You got what? Em-- employees to fire!

42:34.750 --> 42:36.583
-You got employees to fire? No!
-Okay.

42:36.666 --> 42:38.708
-Okay, we won't fire employees, no.
-We won't.

42:38.791 --> 42:40.333
No, no. Sh, sh.

42:40.416 --> 42:42.208
-Sh, sh, sh.
-Sh, sh, sh.

42:42.291 --> 42:44.291
Sh, sh, sh…

42:44.375 --> 42:45.791
-Yeah?

43:29.333 --> 43:31.041
-Nat, you okay?
-Yep.

43:33.583 --> 43:37.250
-Okay, that doesn't sound okay.
-Yeah.

43:37.333 --> 43:39.333
-What is it?
-It's just the hormones.

43:40.750 --> 43:43.250
-And I'm--
-Okay. I know.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.166
Okay.

43:45.958 --> 43:50.416
I want you to know that this…
this is normal.

43:52.833 --> 43:54.416
This doesn't feel normal.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.666
Well, it is.

43:57.666 --> 43:58.791
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:59.958 --> 44:03.791
There's this thing that happens when
you get pregnant. No one talks about this.

44:04.875 --> 44:08.625
But you… you mourn a little bit.

44:09.833 --> 44:13.500
You mourn, you know,
the person that you used to be.

44:14.125 --> 44:19.125
Because the fact is,
no matter how much you wanna be a mom,

44:19.708 --> 44:23.541
you're never not going to be one again.

44:25.125 --> 44:27.875
-Not to freak you--

44:27.958 --> 44:29.541
-Okay.
-It's a…

44:29.625 --> 44:31.958
That is a huge brain adjustment.

44:32.041 --> 44:36.000
You are letting go of your old self.

44:37.875 --> 44:39.333
Yeah.

44:41.083 --> 44:44.500
But Dad and I are there for you,
no matter what.

44:47.208 --> 44:49.833
All right. We are almost done.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.208
What's going on? Everything okay?

44:54.750 --> 44:56.625
-Haircut.
-Oh.

44:56.708 --> 44:58.125
I felt disgusting.

44:58.208 --> 45:00.875
And we're actively dealing with it, right?

45:00.958 --> 45:02.125
Right.

45:02.208 --> 45:03.458
Take a look at this.

45:03.541 --> 45:06.458
There's still a little bit,
but what do you think of this length?

45:06.541 --> 45:09.041
Oh boy! That looks great!

45:09.125 --> 45:10.958
I look like a mom.

45:13.083 --> 45:14.625
And that's a good thing, right?

45:14.708 --> 45:16.708
Mom jeans, dad bods.

45:16.791 --> 45:18.666
-Parenting is cool now, right?
-No.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.208
Doesn't mean a "mom"
just 'cause it's that length.

45:21.291 --> 45:23.000
I don't want to look like one.

45:23.083 --> 45:24.333
-Wow.
-This looks bad. I hate it.

45:24.416 --> 45:27.708
I loved it when you had
that haircut at her age. Loved it.

45:28.291 --> 45:30.958
You loved everything about me
when I was her age.

45:31.041 --> 45:33.333
-I love everything about you at every age.
-Really?

45:33.416 --> 45:34.583
-Yeah.
-Prove it.

45:34.666 --> 45:35.583
Okay.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.541
-Can you guys give us a moment?

45:39.166 --> 45:40.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:40.333 --> 45:42.541
We will be in our room. You look cute.

45:43.041 --> 45:46.958
I can do, you know,
some point cutting to even--

45:47.625 --> 45:49.083
I think it looks nice.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.750
What's up? Hmm?

45:55.333 --> 45:57.916
Talk to me. I know it's not--
I know it's not the hair.

46:02.375 --> 46:05.375
I just feel like
I don't have a life anymore.

46:09.166 --> 46:10.083
Mm.

46:12.875 --> 46:14.625
Because I don't draw.

46:16.958 --> 46:19.208
I don't see my friends.

46:24.416 --> 46:27.375
I don't do anything. I feel like…

46:30.416 --> 46:31.708
I'm just this.

46:31.791 --> 46:35.416
No, no, no, no. No, you're…
You're everything.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.916
-Hmm.
-You are. You are.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.125
You're doing so much, and… and…

46:40.291 --> 46:43.291
you're doing it on, like, two hours
of sleep every three days.

46:45.250 --> 46:46.208
It's incredible.

46:46.291 --> 46:47.916
You're-- you're literally keeping

46:48.416 --> 46:51.208
a small little human alive
just on your own.

46:53.041 --> 46:54.708
You're doing an amazing job.

46:56.125 --> 46:58.875
And this is gonna be
the toughest thing you ever do in life.

47:00.416 --> 47:01.375
Ever.

47:05.916 --> 47:08.916
When you get through this,
and you will get through this,

47:09.500 --> 47:13.500
you're gonna take off like if Elon
built you himself, whoosh, like a rocket.

47:13.583 --> 47:14.875
I promise you!

47:22.208 --> 47:23.666
And you look beautiful,

47:24.541 --> 47:25.791
like you always do.

47:31.791 --> 47:33.833
Here we go!

47:33.916 --> 47:36.833
-Half a cake for half a birthday!
-Whoa!

47:36.916 --> 47:38.500
Look what's coming!

47:38.583 --> 47:40.541
-That is unbelievable.
-Wow!

47:41.125 --> 47:42.000
Look at that!

47:42.083 --> 47:44.291
Look at her face.
She doesn't even know what to do.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.291
-Can you believe that?
-Wow!

47:46.375 --> 47:48.541
-That's a cake!
-You want some? Oh!

47:48.625 --> 47:50.000
-Want some cake?
-Sh, sh!

47:50.083 --> 47:51.875
-That's for you, bubby.
-Look, Ro!

47:51.958 --> 47:55.333
This little old lady!
You're half a year old!

47:55.416 --> 47:56.916
Oh yeah!

47:59.291 --> 48:00.375
Hi!

48:00.458 --> 48:02.750
-You want some cake, Ro?
-Here we go.

48:02.833 --> 48:04.291
-Everybody ready?
-There we go.

48:04.375 --> 48:07.750
-Aww!
-Okay. I don't wanna crop Gabe out.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.666
Get in there. Okay, you ready?

48:10.750 --> 48:12.666
-There you go!
-Here we go!

48:12.750 --> 48:15.083
-Aah! Yeah!
-One, two, three, yeah!

48:15.666 --> 48:16.708
Hannah!

48:17.666 --> 48:19.875
-Hannah, I need coffee right away.

48:19.958 --> 48:22.458
She's always upset
about the goat legs.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.791
Hi. Um, I have just a couple ideas
for Billy. The--

48:45.875 --> 48:48.375
I didn't ask for ideas.
I asked for coffee.

48:50.916 --> 48:51.791
Yes.

48:52.791 --> 48:56.666
I tried to show her.
She just doesn't see me as an artist.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.583
I didn't think it would be so difficult.

48:58.666 --> 49:02.041
Maybe I should leave and become a barista.
I don't know.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.083
Have you ever considered leaving?

49:04.166 --> 49:05.416
Uh…

49:05.500 --> 49:06.916
Actually, I, um…

49:07.500 --> 49:09.291
You know, I got a job, another job.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.291
-Uh…
-You did?

49:11.375 --> 49:13.333
Yeah. I don't know
if I'm gonna take it, though.

49:13.416 --> 49:16.375
It's a small documentary
production company.

49:16.458 --> 49:19.541
A lateral move, at best. Pay cut.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.833
Although technically,
I would be a producer.

49:21.916 --> 49:23.125
You would be a producer?

49:23.208 --> 49:24.875
Yeah, but like a baby producer. It--

49:24.958 --> 49:26.916
You should do it. You should--

49:27.000 --> 49:29.875
This is moving in the direction
you wanna move in. Take the job.

49:29.958 --> 49:33.166
They're shooting a heli-ski documentary.
You know what heli-skiing is?

49:33.250 --> 49:35.541
-No.
-It's jumping-out-of-helicopters skiing.

49:35.625 --> 49:37.708
-I'd get to--
-Oh! You would do this?

49:37.791 --> 49:40.708
-Not me, but I'd go with the guys who do.
-Watch people do it.

49:40.791 --> 49:42.750
Yeah. I'll get to go to Switzerland and…

49:43.250 --> 49:45.875
Oh God, Alaska, Chile, Japan, hopefully.

49:45.958 --> 49:48.250
I hope I get to go to Japan.
I always wanted to go.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.333
Oh my God!

49:49.416 --> 49:51.666
This movie…

49:52.583 --> 49:53.416
this movie…

49:53.500 --> 49:56.791
The animation director of this movie,
her work is so beautiful.

49:56.875 --> 49:57.875
When I first saw it,

49:57.958 --> 50:01.833
it-- it, like, gave me the same feeling
as when I first saw <i>Spirited Away.</i>

50:01.916 --> 50:02.750
-Ah!
-You know?

50:02.833 --> 50:04.375
-Love <i>Spirited Away.</i>
-Mm-hmm?

50:04.458 --> 50:06.250
I've-- I've been saying for years,

50:06.333 --> 50:09.500
somebody should make
a live-action remake of <i>Spirited Away.</i>

50:09.583 --> 50:11.625
You have not been saying that for years.

50:11.708 --> 50:14.375
-Yes. What's wrong with that?
-No. Oh my God.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.333
-What's the matter with that?
-No!

50:16.416 --> 50:19.208
-What's wrong with a remake?
-I'm walking away.

50:19.875 --> 50:20.791
Wha--

50:21.333 --> 50:23.958
What do you--
What's-- what's so bad about that?

50:25.166 --> 50:26.166
Okay.

50:26.750 --> 50:27.708
Making…

50:29.375 --> 50:33.083
a live-action remake
of an animated film

50:33.166 --> 50:38.750
is like trying to tell somebody
about your dream that you had last night.

50:38.833 --> 50:41.458
The magic never translates.
It never works.

50:41.541 --> 50:45.958
Okay, so you-- you don't think
there's any value in taking one story

50:46.041 --> 50:47.708
and telling it two different ways?

50:47.791 --> 50:50.041
Why do you need a live-action version

50:50.125 --> 50:54.625
when the animated interpretation
is always so much more beautiful?

50:54.708 --> 50:56.958
It conveys what reality can't.

50:57.041 --> 51:01.333
You're saying that there is
no live-action remake of an animated film

51:01.416 --> 51:04.166
that isn't as good
or a little bit better than the original?

51:04.250 --> 51:06.208
-Not one?
-Name-- name one.

51:06.291 --> 51:08.291
<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</i> Boom.

51:08.375 --> 51:10.333
2014?

51:10.416 --> 51:11.916
No, not 2014. 1990.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.125
Oh!

51:13.208 --> 51:15.625
There are more, by the way.
I could name you more.

51:15.708 --> 51:16.958
Well, please.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.083
-If I had my notes in front of me.

51:19.166 --> 51:20.166
Okay.

51:24.000 --> 51:24.916
I got 'em.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.875
Okay. Um…

51:31.375 --> 51:35.333
Okay. So I see myself
in one just above Sunset.

51:35.416 --> 51:37.500
Mm. House in the Hills. Classic.

51:37.583 --> 51:38.583
Mm--

51:38.666 --> 51:42.375
But also an animation studio
just off the PCH.

51:42.458 --> 51:44.541
Oh, the traffic's gonna be a nightmare.

51:45.416 --> 51:48.125
That's okay.
I will have a studio off the PCH.

51:48.208 --> 51:50.208
That's true. Right.
Close to the beach. That's good.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.333
Oh!

51:53.250 --> 51:54.375
Yeah. What about you?

51:54.458 --> 51:56.833
Aah… I'm a man of simple tastes.

51:56.916 --> 51:59.666
I just need a small production studio,
you know.

52:00.750 --> 52:03.000
-Fifty, sixty employees, you know.

52:03.083 --> 52:05.666
Four-bedroom apartment directly above it.

52:05.750 --> 52:10.250
So you want a…
a bougie high-rise in Brentwood

52:11.125 --> 52:15.416
or just, like, a $30 million
sprawling mansion.

52:16.041 --> 52:16.958
Mid-century?

52:17.541 --> 52:18.958
No. No, no. Not at all.

52:19.041 --> 52:20.583
-Oh, thank God.
-No, um…

52:20.666 --> 52:21.791
-I'm so sorry.
-Uh, no, no.

52:21.875 --> 52:26.041
I-- I want something,
you know, warm and soulful. Um…

52:27.000 --> 52:29.500
My friend once described me
as a blueberry muffin.

52:29.583 --> 52:31.458
-So I need something sort of…

52:31.541 --> 52:32.583
I love muffins.

52:32.666 --> 52:34.291
…in keeping with that.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.750
I'm thinking, like,
a Spanish bungalow, you know,

52:36.833 --> 52:40.041
rooted in the past
but with an eye towards the future.

52:40.541 --> 52:42.416
-I just made that up.
-I love that.

52:44.541 --> 52:47.125
-Five years, you think?
-Mm… Probably six.

52:47.208 --> 52:48.833
Six. Sounds more realistic.

52:48.916 --> 52:52.541
-It's-- Things take a while here.
-Yeah. Some things.

52:55.041 --> 52:58.500
So how do we get there?
You know, how do we make this happen?

52:58.583 --> 53:00.416
How do we achieve these things?

53:01.541 --> 53:03.166
-"We"?
-Yeah. Oh, well…

53:03.250 --> 53:06.791
-"We," as in individual "we's."
-Right.

53:11.875 --> 53:12.750
What?

53:16.583 --> 53:19.208
You know, when I moved to LA, um…

53:20.833 --> 53:23.333
I moved to LA because I thought I had to.

53:23.416 --> 53:24.750
-Yeah.
-You know? For work.

53:24.833 --> 53:25.750
Mm-hmm.

53:25.833 --> 53:29.291
I just realized I've spent
so much of the time since I've been here

53:29.375 --> 53:33.916
trying to convince myself that
this was the place I was supposed to be.

53:34.000 --> 53:34.916
Mm.

53:37.708 --> 53:39.583
I don't feel that way anymore.

53:45.791 --> 53:48.583
I feel like this is definitely
where I'm supposed to be.

53:52.666 --> 53:54.583
This feels like where I'm supposed to be.

53:55.083 --> 53:55.916
Good.

54:07.125 --> 54:08.333
Shh!

54:15.958 --> 54:17.250
Oh!

54:20.583 --> 54:21.666
Oh.

54:23.875 --> 54:24.750
Hi, I'm Jake.

54:25.333 --> 54:27.041
-Cara.
-Nice to meet you, Cara.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.250
It's good to be met.

54:32.791 --> 54:34.083
I was just leaving.

54:34.166 --> 54:35.333
Oh, yeah.

54:36.250 --> 54:37.750
I'm glad I got to meet you.

54:39.916 --> 54:40.916
Hi!

54:41.791 --> 54:45.750
-Hey, what's up?
-Hi. I brought you a housewarming gift.

54:45.833 --> 54:48.666
-Oh, wow, you shouldn't have. This is--
-For both of us.

54:49.708 --> 54:51.416
-To share.
-Hmm--

54:52.083 --> 54:54.708
I don't remember the last time
we both had a night off.

54:54.791 --> 54:57.166
I know. Congratulations. Cheers.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.416
-Cheers.
-This place is really great. Mm.

55:02.166 --> 55:03.125
Thank you.

55:03.208 --> 55:06.791
Look it! You have your own little…
You've got such a nice space.

55:06.875 --> 55:09.625
-Yeah.
-Your own little practice space!

55:09.708 --> 55:12.416
Well, I'm gonna be
my neighbors' favorite, so…

55:13.000 --> 55:14.458
Uh, you know what? They're lucky.

55:15.291 --> 55:17.208
-They're lucky to hear you play.
-Are they?

55:17.291 --> 55:18.916
-You're gonna go at it. Okay.
-Yeah.

55:21.625 --> 55:23.541
-Put this foot over there.
-What do I do? Oh.

55:23.625 --> 55:25.083
-That foot there--

55:25.166 --> 55:26.125
This is…
-God.

55:27.291 --> 55:28.625
You gotta really kick it. Kick it.

55:28.708 --> 55:30.666
-Kick it like you mean it.
-It scares me.

55:30.750 --> 55:33.875
-Kick it like you mean it. It's gonna…

55:33.958 --> 55:36.708
Okay. Now, let's go with a soft roll.

55:40.583 --> 55:42.000
Speed it up, speed it up!

56:02.541 --> 56:03.708
Whoa, hold on.

56:04.541 --> 56:05.500
Sorry.

56:06.375 --> 56:07.583
Sorry.

56:07.666 --> 56:08.750
Uh…

56:10.291 --> 56:13.500
Let's, uh… let's talk about--
Let's talk about this.

56:13.583 --> 56:14.791
Uh…

56:14.875 --> 56:15.750
Okay.

56:16.458 --> 56:17.541
For a minute.

56:19.166 --> 56:21.500
-Yeah.
-You know, because last time,

56:22.875 --> 56:25.000
we said it wasn't gonna be a big deal,

56:25.083 --> 56:28.500
and then it was, like,
the biggest deal ever.

56:28.583 --> 56:34.541
And it could be even bigger
now that Rosie's… involved.

56:36.125 --> 56:37.000
So…

56:38.958 --> 56:41.375
Yeah, yeah, it definitely… It can… Um…

56:43.083 --> 56:45.166
Which is why I was just kind of…

56:46.666 --> 56:49.500
I was thinking that maybe
you and Ro could move in here with me.

56:53.166 --> 56:56.666
No pressure, but you could set up
your little art studio right there,

56:56.750 --> 57:00.666
and there's, like, two good schools
in the neighborhood for Ro.

57:01.375 --> 57:03.375
Um… If we're thinking that far ahead,

57:03.458 --> 57:06.541
I think it would be-- would be prudent
to think about where she goes to school.

57:06.625 --> 57:07.541
Um…

57:08.875 --> 57:11.416
Okay, uh, it just seems like…

57:12.500 --> 57:15.541
I can barely keep my head above water
as it is,

57:15.625 --> 57:18.166
and the idea of moving
and not having my parents--

57:18.250 --> 57:20.625
We could be doing that stuff together,
you know, just--

57:21.958 --> 57:25.416
just as-- as co-parents or…

57:28.541 --> 57:30.750
just as… just as parents.

57:34.208 --> 57:36.125
What's the worst thing that could happen?

57:37.000 --> 57:40.708
You know, we could give this a real shot
and-- and see where it goes.

57:40.791 --> 57:43.916
This could end badly.
Gabe, you and I, we're so different--

57:44.000 --> 57:46.541
-Is that a bad thing?
-I don't want to lose this.

57:46.625 --> 57:50.375
What if we can never go back to this?
This is-- this is good. This works.

57:50.458 --> 57:52.416
What if, what if, what if, what if…

57:53.458 --> 57:56.083
What if it works well? What if it--
What if it works amazing?

57:56.166 --> 57:58.250
What if it just is the beginning of, like…

57:59.500 --> 58:02.375
this beautiful thing that we create?

58:03.208 --> 58:04.500
You know, like, what if that?

58:05.000 --> 58:09.708
What if Ro gets to be
with both of her parents… together?

58:10.875 --> 58:13.083
I'm scared. I'm sorry.

58:13.166 --> 58:16.333
I can't. I'm--
I don't-- I can't risk this.

58:17.291 --> 58:19.166
I don't wanna risk this.

58:21.208 --> 58:24.125
Just for Ro. I'm sorry. I can't.

58:27.541 --> 58:28.625
That's…

58:30.666 --> 58:31.666
I get it. Um…

58:31.750 --> 58:34.458
Just because I'm not ready
doesn't mean you can't be ready.

58:35.833 --> 58:38.250
Enjoy this space, you know?

58:38.333 --> 58:40.416
-Yeah. I mean…
-Go start dating!

58:40.500 --> 58:43.083
-Dating…
-Or not. I don't know.

58:43.166 --> 58:44.375
No, I…

58:50.583 --> 58:52.166
If you want.

58:58.291 --> 58:59.208
Okay.

59:04.250 --> 59:05.208
Okay.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.291
…'cause she is so cute!

59:15.375 --> 59:16.708
Come here, baby girl!

59:16.791 --> 59:19.125
-Oh, big burp! Big burp!
-Oh, go to Momma.

59:19.208 --> 59:21.166
-Huh.

59:21.791 --> 59:22.833
I miss you.

59:22.916 --> 59:23.958
I miss you.

59:24.041 --> 59:25.708
-I miss you too. A lot.
-Mm-hmm.

59:29.250 --> 59:31.583
-Oh! Wait, I remember this.

59:32.125 --> 59:35.333
You were always the most organized person
in the world with this thing.

59:35.416 --> 59:37.166
They're just doodles.

59:37.250 --> 59:38.541
They're just doodles!

59:38.625 --> 59:40.666
Just doodles?

59:40.750 --> 59:42.291
No, these are…

59:43.791 --> 59:45.166
These are so good. Who is this guy?

59:45.250 --> 59:48.791
So, when Ro was first born,
she had her days and nights mixed up.

59:48.875 --> 59:52.583
So we started calling her
our little night owl. Boop!

59:53.416 --> 59:54.500
Beep!

59:54.583 --> 59:58.541
And Gabe does this little voice with her
where he makes her say things as the owl,

59:58.625 --> 1:00:02.708
and it's… it's just the cutest
and cringiest thing you've ever seen.

1:00:02.791 --> 1:00:04.291
Isn't that right?

1:00:07.791 --> 1:00:10.041
So Gabe got his own place?

1:00:10.916 --> 1:00:12.875
-Uh-huh.
-How's that been?

1:00:13.750 --> 1:00:15.250
Um, it sucks.

1:00:15.333 --> 1:00:16.958
Um, he offered to stay,

1:00:17.041 --> 1:00:22.000
but I actually told him
to go and get his own space and bed

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:25.041
-and to put some women in it.

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:27.791
-Wait, it was-- it was your idea?
-Yeah, it was mine.

1:00:28.416 --> 1:00:31.208
-Wh-- why would you do that?
-I don't know.

1:00:31.708 --> 1:00:33.833
I was overwhelmed.

1:00:33.916 --> 1:00:36.791
I started seeing him
as, like, this man for the first time,

1:00:36.875 --> 1:00:40.291
-and it was scary and overwhelming.

1:00:40.375 --> 1:00:41.583
And, um…

1:00:43.166 --> 1:00:45.583
And I screwed up! I screwed up!

1:00:47.458 --> 1:00:49.583
Gimme a little smoochy!

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:02.250
-You gotta keep goin'.
-Okay!

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:05.666
-Did you get one? Can I have one?
-Yes, you can have one.

1:01:05.750 --> 1:01:06.833
Oh!

1:01:08.083 --> 1:01:10.625
Oh! That's… that's my poster.

1:01:11.208 --> 1:01:12.708
That's my name!

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.791
Stand by the poster.

1:01:18.708 --> 1:01:20.333
Look. Wanna go see that?

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:23.125
-Are you gonna go see that?
-Yes.

1:01:26.791 --> 1:01:29.291
-Don't do it.
-I don't have a technique, but I could…

1:01:29.375 --> 1:01:31.833
I thought you were gonna say,
"I don't have a tongue."

1:01:38.541 --> 1:01:40.958
I'm gonna be the lead producer
on the Sable Island project.

1:01:41.041 --> 1:01:42.791
-You are?
-Yeah. It's never gonna happen.

1:01:42.875 --> 1:01:44.333
-It won't get funded.
-Don't say that.

1:01:44.416 --> 1:01:48.208
-It's cool that it's my project.
-It is. Oh my God! That's amazing!

1:01:48.291 --> 1:01:51.083
And I was thinking maybe
we could look for a place together.

1:01:51.583 --> 1:01:54.541
You and me move… Get a place together?

1:01:54.625 --> 1:01:57.208
-You know… Yeah, unless you don't want to.
-No, no, I--

1:01:58.250 --> 1:02:00.166
I want to. You wanna-- you want to?

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.958
-Then let's do it.
-I think we should do it.

1:02:03.041 --> 1:02:04.333
I'll start looking.

1:02:04.416 --> 1:02:05.791
Aww!

1:02:05.875 --> 1:02:08.041
This-- I can't--
This thing's defective. I--

1:02:08.125 --> 1:02:09.208
Seriously?

1:02:09.291 --> 1:02:12.750
Oh, oh! I'm just trying
to get the mud off your foot.

1:02:12.833 --> 1:02:14.833
-I'm sorry!

1:02:16.250 --> 1:02:18.958
She's almost as cute
as Natalie was as a baby.

1:02:19.041 --> 1:02:20.708
We made that baby.

1:02:20.791 --> 1:02:23.458
I mean, through one other baby.

1:02:23.541 --> 1:02:25.458
-I get it. I follow.
-Yeah. Okay.

1:02:25.541 --> 1:02:26.916
How you doin', buddy?

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.125
Pretty good.

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:31.625
-Hey, Gabe!
-All right…

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:33.333
-Hey.
-Oh, hey!

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:34.833
Who's that?

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:38.708
I think that's Miranda. His new lady.

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.416
-No kiddin'.
-She's cute.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.208
I want big bubbles!

1:02:43.708 --> 1:02:45.625
-That's nice she's here.
-Yeah.

1:02:45.708 --> 1:02:47.583
-Good for him.
-I know.

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:50.333
What have you got…

1:02:50.416 --> 1:02:51.541
-Nothing…
-Hi!

1:02:51.625 --> 1:02:52.500
Hi.

1:02:53.916 --> 1:02:55.625
Can I talk to you inside for two seconds?

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:02.791
What's up?

1:03:02.875 --> 1:03:05.833
I just didn't know
that Miranda was gonna be here today.

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:08.000
You-- you told me to bring a guest.

1:03:08.083 --> 1:03:10.500
Yeah, but I just don't know her,

1:03:11.333 --> 1:03:13.500
and now she's at my parents' house…

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:16.208
And?

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:19.583
Now she knows that I live with my parents,
and that just is weird to me.

1:03:19.666 --> 1:03:20.708
Why wouldn't she?

1:03:21.541 --> 1:03:24.000
She's in my life.
And I want her to be in ours.

1:03:24.083 --> 1:03:25.750
Get to know Rosie.

1:03:30.291 --> 1:03:32.625
But, um… I do have to thank you, though.

1:03:33.208 --> 1:03:34.083
For what?

1:03:34.750 --> 1:03:35.791
Um…

1:03:36.708 --> 1:03:38.250
Well, if it wasn't for you…

1:03:39.375 --> 1:03:42.041
telling me to get out there
and start dating again, I…

1:03:43.333 --> 1:03:47.125
I wouldn't have met her, so thank you.

1:03:51.250 --> 1:03:52.708
Well, then, you're welcome.

1:04:10.791 --> 1:04:12.916
-Oh, that was fun.

1:04:13.708 --> 1:04:14.666
Yeah.

1:04:18.458 --> 1:04:20.291
-Okay, bye.

1:04:20.375 --> 1:04:21.708
-Right up. Yep.
-Okay. See ya.

1:04:22.875 --> 1:04:23.791
Bye.

1:04:25.375 --> 1:04:27.541
Well, well, well.

1:04:28.208 --> 1:04:29.208
Nice.

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:30.208
Yeah. You know?

1:04:30.291 --> 1:04:34.750
Things do be moving fast around here.
Gotta keep up. Whew!

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:36.333
I was gonna eat that.

1:04:36.416 --> 1:04:38.291
-It's okay. We have more.
-Do you?

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:40.541
-Yeah, in the kitchen.
-I'll get some. Want somethin'?

1:04:40.625 --> 1:04:43.875
No, I'm okay. Oh, wait! But wait, hold on.
I wanna show you something.

1:04:46.041 --> 1:04:48.000
I'm gonna show Lucy my portfolio,

1:04:49.166 --> 1:04:53.166
and I want
your brutally honest opinion, please.

1:04:53.250 --> 1:04:54.750
-Hell, yes.
-Take a look.

1:05:00.125 --> 1:05:01.291
You just swipe.

1:05:15.125 --> 1:05:16.041
Wow.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:21.625
These are great.

1:05:23.250 --> 1:05:24.958
-Yeah?
-When are you gonna show her?

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:29.291
-Soon. Sometime soon.
-Uh-huh.

1:05:29.375 --> 1:05:31.500
You should 'cause
you're gonna wrap soon, right?

1:05:31.583 --> 1:05:34.166
-Yeah?
-She'll be staffing up her next project.

1:05:34.250 --> 1:05:36.208
-You want her thinkin' of you.
-True.

1:05:37.208 --> 1:05:41.000
I don't know. It's hard to,
like, sell myself in that way.

1:05:42.791 --> 1:05:44.375
You have to ask for what you want.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:46.833
Okay?

1:05:48.166 --> 1:05:50.333

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:55.083
Lucy?

1:05:56.750 --> 1:05:57.583
Lucy?

1:05:58.208 --> 1:05:59.500
Yes. Yes.

1:06:00.208 --> 1:06:01.375
-Sorry.

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:05.041
-Is this the new song for the end?
-It is, it is. Do you like it?

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:06.416
-I do.
-You sure?

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Amazing.

1:06:07.583 --> 1:06:10.791
Well, please tell the team
that we are locking the final sequence!

1:06:10.875 --> 1:06:12.375
-Yay!
-Yes!

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.083
Uh…

1:06:16.208 --> 1:06:21.291
Now that you maybe have a spare moment,
would you be able to look at my portfolio?

1:06:21.375 --> 1:06:22.708
If you have the time--

1:06:22.791 --> 1:06:25.333
Absolutely. I would love to.
Just please send me the link.

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:27.166
Thank you. Thank you.

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:32.208
But she hasn't even opened the link.

1:06:32.291 --> 1:06:34.625
You gotta give people a month
before you follow up.

1:06:35.666 --> 1:06:37.333
-A month?
-Yes, a month.

1:06:38.208 --> 1:06:40.041
What the hell are people doing?

1:06:42.458 --> 1:06:45.833
Oh, did you see the, um…
the Highland Park one?

1:06:45.916 --> 1:06:50.166
It has a cute tile bathroom, and it's,
like, a walk away from Donut Friend,

1:06:50.250 --> 1:06:52.250
which is… nice.

1:06:53.208 --> 1:06:54.458
Did you-- What?

1:06:54.541 --> 1:06:55.416
Uh…

1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:58.125
We got the funding
for the Sable Island project.

1:06:59.000 --> 1:06:59.875
Okay.

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:02.541
I'm gonna have to go to Nova Scotia.

1:07:02.625 --> 1:07:04.333
-Oh, well--
-For six months.

1:07:05.791 --> 1:07:06.875
For six months?

1:07:06.958 --> 1:07:08.625
-Or maybe a year.
-Oh my God.

1:07:09.166 --> 1:07:10.083
Yeah.

1:07:12.583 --> 1:07:15.041
-Ah, it's just bad timing.
-Yeah.

1:07:16.375 --> 1:07:19.125
So we're not
looking for an apartment, then?

1:07:19.208 --> 1:07:20.250
I mean…

1:07:22.041 --> 1:07:23.291
we can still.

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:26.291
-I just--
-You won't…

1:07:26.791 --> 1:07:28.875
You just won't be living in it.

1:07:31.208 --> 1:07:32.083
Yeah.

1:07:34.125 --> 1:07:36.208
-It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's fi--
-I'm sorry.

1:07:36.291 --> 1:07:37.625
Don't be sorry.

1:07:38.125 --> 1:07:40.041
This is so great for you.

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:42.458
We'll make it work.
I'm not worried about it.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.000
Okay.

1:07:45.375 --> 1:07:47.000
-Let's get ice cream.
-Okay.

1:07:53.916 --> 1:07:55.041
-Bye, babe.
-Bye.

1:07:55.125 --> 1:07:57.125
Whee!

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.625
Okay. I'll see you soon, okay? Mwah!

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:02.875
Go ahead.

1:08:02.958 --> 1:08:04.416
Have fun while I'm away.

1:08:04.916 --> 1:08:06.041
Let's go.

1:08:28.583 --> 1:08:30.875
-Hi!
-Hey!

1:08:32.125 --> 1:08:33.208
You made it!

1:08:33.708 --> 1:08:35.958
-Yeah, only took me four years.
-Mm!

1:08:36.708 --> 1:08:39.125
-I got the invite to Nicole's baby shower.
-Yeah.

1:08:39.208 --> 1:08:41.791
-You gonna go to that?
-I have to go. I live a block away.

1:08:41.875 --> 1:08:45.875
-Right. Well, if you're going, I'll go.
-Mm! I'll get to see you again!

1:08:45.958 --> 1:08:47.291
Yeah!

1:08:47.375 --> 1:08:48.291
I guess.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.125
Thank you for having me here.

1:08:50.208 --> 1:08:52.041
Yeah! Course!

1:08:52.125 --> 1:08:53.291
Yeah, but…

1:08:54.333 --> 1:08:57.625
I needed to get away,
and I'm just thankful to be here.

1:08:57.708 --> 1:09:01.625
I love having you here.
And literally, any time, by the way.

1:09:01.708 --> 1:09:05.791
You know. My couch is your couch.
This is your home too, okay?

1:09:06.375 --> 1:09:09.125
Thank you. I'm gonna get some juice.
Do you want any?

1:09:09.208 --> 1:09:10.333
No, I'm okay.

1:09:11.208 --> 1:09:12.166
Be right back.

1:09:12.250 --> 1:09:13.083
Okay.

1:09:15.625 --> 1:09:17.791
-Oh shit.
-Oh God. I am so sorry.

1:09:17.875 --> 1:09:19.541
No, it's okay. Um…

1:09:19.625 --> 1:09:21.833
-It's fine. No, don't worry about it.
-Aah… There.

1:09:21.916 --> 1:09:24.541
They're old. It's fine.
Seriously, it's fine.

1:09:24.625 --> 1:09:26.125
You shouldn't have said that.

1:09:26.208 --> 1:09:28.458
I was gonna insist
on buying you a round of drinks.

1:09:28.541 --> 1:09:33.291
Oh, well, then, you know,
they're actually vintage and priceless.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:35.708
-I love it a lot. So…
-Yeah. That's what I thought. I--

1:09:35.791 --> 1:09:37.833
I deeply apologize,
and I owe you a round of drinks.

1:09:37.916 --> 1:09:40.000
-You actually don't have to.
-No, I'm going to.

1:09:40.083 --> 1:09:41.458
-Oh, okay.
-And sorry again.

1:09:41.541 --> 1:09:42.458
Thank you.

1:09:48.750 --> 1:09:51.833
I would love to grab that table some…

1:09:56.791 --> 1:10:00.458
I really cannot imagine
what my life would have been like here.

1:10:00.541 --> 1:10:01.750
-What?
-Mm-mm.

1:10:01.833 --> 1:10:04.500
-That's a lie.
-No, 'cause it's very overwhelming.

1:10:04.583 --> 1:10:06.416
Whatever. Wasn't meant to be.

1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:09.666
You were supposed to go
and have your gorgeous family.

1:10:11.041 --> 1:10:12.041
Yeah.

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:16.500
I said I found a really good place
that's near here.

1:10:17.083 --> 1:10:18.125
<i>Uh…</i>

1:10:18.875 --> 1:10:20.416
<i>Aah, sorry, I can't…</i>

1:10:21.458 --> 1:10:22.333
Hello?

1:10:23.291 --> 1:10:24.500
<i>Um, I miss you.</i>

1:10:24.583 --> 1:10:27.208
I-- I miss you too! I miss you!

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:29.958
I'm telling you about the apartment.
I emailed you. It's--

1:10:30.041 --> 1:10:32.125
<i>I can't hear what you're saying. Sorry.</i>

1:10:32.208 --> 1:10:35.541
-It has a really cute studio space for me.

1:10:36.083 --> 1:10:37.125
Can you hear me?

1:11:04.625 --> 1:11:05.458
Hey.

1:11:05.541 --> 1:11:07.166
Uh, Blue Bottle?

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:09.916
What?

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:11.916
Uh… Coffee?

1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:14.208
Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you.

1:11:20.708 --> 1:11:22.083
Mm.

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:29.041
Hi, good morning!

1:11:29.541 --> 1:11:30.583
<i>Mommy!</i>

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:32.916
How are you, baby?

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:33.833
<i>Good.</i>

1:11:35.583 --> 1:11:37.375
Good. I miss you.

1:11:38.083 --> 1:11:40.166
Can I speak to your dad for a second?

1:11:40.250 --> 1:11:41.750
<i>Daddy's not here.</i>

1:11:42.416 --> 1:11:43.583
No? Where is he?

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:46.708
<i>Daddy said Jessie's in charge.</i>

1:11:49.083 --> 1:11:50.041
Who's Jessie?

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:53.208
<i>She's a girl.</i>

1:11:53.791 --> 1:11:55.500
Has she been with you all night?

1:11:55.583 --> 1:11:57.625
<i>Yeah, she slept on the couch.</i>

1:11:58.250 --> 1:12:00.958
<i>I miss you. When are you coming home?</i>

1:12:01.041 --> 1:12:04.041
I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come, gonna see you soon. Okay?

1:12:05.666 --> 1:12:07.750
Okay. Love you. I'll see you soon.

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:09.541
<i>-Bye, Mommy.</i>
Bye, Ro.

1:12:10.166 --> 1:12:11.625
What the fuck?

1:12:23.083 --> 1:12:25.541
<i>Yo, this is Gabe. Leave your message.</i>

1:12:26.833 --> 1:12:29.041
-Gabe, call me back right now.

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:32.291
Hey. Morning.

1:12:32.375 --> 1:12:33.541
Hi.

1:12:34.125 --> 1:12:37.708
Should we maybe get some brunch
before we go to the beach?

1:12:37.791 --> 1:12:41.083
I think I have to go. Home.
I think I have to go home.

1:12:42.166 --> 1:12:43.291
Wh--

1:12:43.791 --> 1:12:44.750
Like…

1:12:45.791 --> 1:12:47.833
-Uh-- Like Texas?
-Yeah.

1:12:47.916 --> 1:12:49.833
-You just got here.
-No, I know.

1:12:49.916 --> 1:12:50.958
Uh…

1:12:51.041 --> 1:12:53.458
Rosie just called me.
She doesn't know where Gabe is.

1:12:53.541 --> 1:12:55.750
I don't know where Gabe is.
He's not answering his phone.

1:12:55.833 --> 1:12:58.250
She's with a sitter.
She was with a sitter all night.

1:12:58.333 --> 1:13:00.666
Oh, she's with-- she's with a sitter?

1:13:00.750 --> 1:13:03.750
Yeah, but I don't know her.
I don't know who this person is.

1:13:03.833 --> 1:13:05.041
Do you have to go home, though?

1:13:05.125 --> 1:13:08.541
-I mean, I just took the week off work--
-I know. Yeah. No. I know.

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:13.208
-Like, we were gonna go and brunch and--
-Rosie-- Rosie just takes precedence over…

1:13:15.041 --> 1:13:17.833
brunch and going to the beach, you know?

1:13:18.666 --> 1:13:20.875
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah.

1:13:22.666 --> 1:13:24.000
-Hey.
-Some coffee?

1:13:24.083 --> 1:13:25.166
Yeah, thanks.

1:13:27.416 --> 1:13:29.500
Wanna go to the beach?

1:13:29.583 --> 1:13:31.333
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:13:31.416 --> 1:13:32.416
Mm-hmm.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.458
Do you wanna get brunch?

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:37.750
Um…

1:13:38.208 --> 1:13:39.750
You had a few days.

1:13:39.833 --> 1:13:41.250
Hey, it's so much…

1:13:45.458 --> 1:13:46.791
-Natalie?
-Yeah?

1:13:46.875 --> 1:13:48.166
In my office, please.

1:13:48.250 --> 1:13:49.250
Yeah.

1:13:51.208 --> 1:13:52.125
Yes?

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:56.000
Have a seat.

1:14:03.458 --> 1:14:05.375
I'm gonna be really honest.

1:14:05.458 --> 1:14:06.333
Okay.

1:14:13.333 --> 1:14:17.416
There's definitely some skill there.
Nice perspective, beautiful shading…

1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:18.375
Thank you.

1:14:19.166 --> 1:14:22.500
…but it, um… it feels a little derivative.

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:25.333
Oh, actually, a lot derivative.

1:14:27.250 --> 1:14:28.458
Okay, what do you mean?

1:14:28.541 --> 1:14:30.500
Like you use some algorithm.

1:14:31.041 --> 1:14:32.166
You see, you're smart.

1:14:32.250 --> 1:14:35.666
You've done the work. That's a good thing.
That is a great thing.

1:14:35.750 --> 1:14:39.333
But it seems to me that you are drawing
what you think you should draw,

1:14:39.416 --> 1:14:41.625
based on what already is.

1:14:41.708 --> 1:14:44.541
You see, I see Barbera.

1:14:44.625 --> 1:14:46.041
I see Chuck Jones.

1:14:46.125 --> 1:14:48.041
I see Tissa David.

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:52.291
I even see a bit of myself,
but I don't see you in any of this.

1:14:54.041 --> 1:14:55.041
Okay.

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:56.833
Maybe…

1:14:58.333 --> 1:15:03.250
maybe you could help me find… my voice?

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:06.208
"Help you find your voice."

1:15:06.291 --> 1:15:09.791
You know, I was an assistant at Pixar
for many years.

1:15:09.875 --> 1:15:11.416
And I learned a lot. It was great.

1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:13.458
But the biggest lesson that I learned

1:15:13.541 --> 1:15:18.750
was that I was spending so much time
helping other people find their voice

1:15:18.833 --> 1:15:21.291
that I had no time to find my own.

1:15:22.833 --> 1:15:25.125
And one day, I just quit,

1:15:25.208 --> 1:15:28.458
and I took a shit job
that I didn't have to take home,

1:15:28.541 --> 1:15:32.291
and all I did every single day
was find my voice.

1:15:32.375 --> 1:15:36.041
I didn't have a mentor.
I didn't have any help.

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:38.958
Do you understand?

1:15:40.625 --> 1:15:42.250
Are you trying to tell me I should quit?

1:15:42.333 --> 1:15:45.416
I'm telling you that
everybody has that moment in their life

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:48.000
where they have to decide
what's most important to them.

1:15:48.083 --> 1:15:49.000
This.

1:15:49.583 --> 1:15:53.083
This is… what's most important to me.

1:15:54.541 --> 1:15:56.333
Then this is the moment.

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.208
<i>She fired you?</i>

1:16:04.750 --> 1:16:09.208
No, but she basically told me that
all my work was unoriginal, uninspired,

1:16:09.291 --> 1:16:15.416
and that I was copying other artists,
and that I should basically just quit.

1:16:20.958 --> 1:16:22.166
Are you listening to me?

1:16:23.125 --> 1:16:26.375
<i>Yes. Yeah. I'm-- I'm sorry, Nat. That's--</i>

1:16:27.083 --> 1:16:29.083
<i>-That's really unfair.</i>

1:16:29.833 --> 1:16:34.625
<i>Okay, uh, what I'll do is, when I--</i>
<i>when I get a second, I'll, um, call Jenny.</i>

1:16:34.708 --> 1:16:37.083
<i>-She had some leads for me…</i>
-No! Please don't call Jenny.

1:16:37.166 --> 1:16:39.000
I don't want you to help.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.166
I'm just trying to vent to you.

1:16:42.250 --> 1:16:45.083
I just wanna talk to my boyfriend
and feel comforted.

1:16:45.166 --> 1:16:46.625
I just wanna connect with you,

1:16:46.708 --> 1:16:50.875
because I feel like that doesn't really
happen very much these days.

1:16:52.166 --> 1:16:54.541
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Um…</i>

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:58.458
I've created space for you.
I've sent you apartment listings.

1:16:58.541 --> 1:17:01.166
You don't even look at them.
You don't even answer me.

1:17:01.666 --> 1:17:04.833
I'm trying to create a home
and a life with you. I wish you would…

1:17:05.666 --> 1:17:09.208
I wish you would want
to include me in your plan.

1:17:09.291 --> 1:17:13.125
<i>Nat, I'm here on the phone with you.</i>
<i>I'm talking to you. I…</i>

1:17:13.208 --> 1:17:16.166
<i>It is a ridiculous day here,</i>

1:17:16.916 --> 1:17:18.541
<i>and I'm freezing my ass off,</i>

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:21.791
<i>and I'm on the other side</i>
<i>of the continent.</i>

1:17:21.875 --> 1:17:25.625
<i>But I'm here, I'm talking to you.</i>
<i>I don't know what more you want from me.</i>

1:17:25.708 --> 1:17:27.791
<i>I'm-- I'm doing my best here.</i>
<i>I know it sucks, but--</i>

1:17:27.875 --> 1:17:30.791
Maybe you are exactly
where you're supposed to be.

1:17:30.875 --> 1:17:33.125
But right now, that is not with me.

1:17:36.166 --> 1:17:39.041
This isn't working. It's just not working.

1:17:47.875 --> 1:17:49.666
<i>Right, well, if you feel</i>
<i>like it's not working,</i>

1:17:49.750 --> 1:17:52.041
<i>then it's not working. I'm sorry.</i>

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:01.125
Okay. Bye.

1:18:15.916 --> 1:18:16.875
Yeah. Hi.

1:18:17.833 --> 1:18:19.583
Hi, Ro! Hi, baby!

1:18:19.666 --> 1:18:21.291
-Hi, baby girl!
-Mommy!

1:18:21.375 --> 1:18:23.666
Hi! I missed you!

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:25.375
-Are you drawing?
-Yes.

1:18:25.458 --> 1:18:26.958
Oh my God. It's so beautiful.

1:18:27.041 --> 1:18:28.916
-Can you get your stuff? We're going home.
-Okay.

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.333
Get your stuff, and we'll go.

1:18:30.416 --> 1:18:31.875
And get your toys too.

1:18:33.541 --> 1:18:34.416
All right. What's up?

1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:37.666
You left our daughter alone
with someone that I don't know?

1:18:38.666 --> 1:18:40.750
-Not alone. With Miranda's sister.
-Yeah, I know.

1:18:40.833 --> 1:18:42.833
You left her overnight
with a sitter I've never met.

1:18:42.916 --> 1:18:46.083
-With Miranda's sister.
-Great, Gabe. I asked for one weekend.

1:18:46.166 --> 1:18:48.375
One weekend
so I can visit my friend in LA.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:50.625
-One weekend.
-No one told you to end your trip early

1:18:50.708 --> 1:18:52.416
-and come in and start shouting!
-No, no!

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:53.916
-Call--
-My daughter called me.

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.708
And I had to come home
to take care of her.

1:18:55.791 --> 1:18:57.166
-I'm sorry, plans changed.
-What--

1:18:57.250 --> 1:18:59.791
-She wasn't supposed to stay overnight.
-Something took precedence?

1:18:59.875 --> 1:19:01.708
-You couldn't trust me?
-No. I had to come home.

1:19:01.791 --> 1:19:03.833
-You're the only one that's responsible.
-Yeah.

1:19:03.916 --> 1:19:05.666
Yeah, well, I proposed to Miranda.

1:19:08.333 --> 1:19:10.416
That's what happened.
That's what spilled over.

1:19:13.291 --> 1:19:16.208
Just some willy-nilly plan.
Just-- Yeah, just a proposal.

1:19:22.208 --> 1:19:23.416
Oh my…

1:19:26.541 --> 1:19:27.375
Okay.

1:19:29.166 --> 1:19:32.125
That's all you…
"Okay"? Okay, cool.

1:19:35.291 --> 1:19:37.250
Cool. Cool.

1:19:37.333 --> 1:19:40.458
["Carry Me Home" by Jorja Smith

1:19:48.625 --> 1:19:49.791
Rosie. Come here.

1:20:15.833 --> 1:20:17.583
Oh, Nattie.

1:20:20.541 --> 1:20:23.875
Let's go inside and get dry.

1:20:25.458 --> 1:20:26.333
Hi, Mom.

1:20:27.583 --> 1:20:28.666
Okay.

1:20:49.791 --> 1:20:52.166
We finally have you back!

1:20:52.250 --> 1:20:55.416
Is it really you? Boy, am I happy.

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:56.375
Oh!

1:20:56.458 --> 1:20:58.750
-I love you.
-For two days, Dad.

1:21:00.291 --> 1:21:01.583
Sorry about Jake.

1:21:02.208 --> 1:21:03.250
-All right.
-Thank you.

1:21:03.333 --> 1:21:05.750
I made cookies and brownies.
Which one do you want?

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:07.541
I vote brownies.

1:22:14.750 --> 1:22:16.166
Do you think this is it?

1:22:16.250 --> 1:22:19.208
No, I don't.
This looks like my worst nightmare.

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:20.250
Come on.

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:23.666
This looks like the cutest party
in the whole world.

1:22:23.750 --> 1:22:25.625
Think they're gonna have a gender reveal?

1:22:25.708 --> 1:22:27.416
It's a boy. We know it's a boy.

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:30.916
Well…
Oh, yeah, it's blue everywhere.

1:22:32.875 --> 1:22:34.500
Your house is ginormous.

1:22:34.583 --> 1:22:35.708
Thank you.

1:22:35.791 --> 1:22:37.875
Yeah, we decided to upgrade
when we found out.

1:22:37.958 --> 1:22:39.791
-Mm.
-Are you looking into buying?

1:22:39.875 --> 1:22:41.250
Mm-mm.

1:22:41.333 --> 1:22:44.875
No, I'm in LA, so I can't afford anything.
And I was just fired, so…

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:48.791
-Oh, well, you know, that happens.
-It happens.

1:22:48.875 --> 1:22:52.875
How's the yummy boyfriend of yours?
I saw pictures online.

1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.791
Um…

1:22:54.875 --> 1:22:56.625
We just broke up, actually.

1:22:56.708 --> 1:22:57.958
Oh.

1:22:58.583 --> 1:23:02.708
Well, you know, that--
that stuff also happens.

1:23:02.791 --> 1:23:04.666
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm.

1:23:07.125 --> 1:23:09.041
Are you still doing any drawing?

1:23:09.125 --> 1:23:12.583
I still have that last picture
that you drew for me up on my fridge.

1:23:12.666 --> 1:23:14.208
Oh, no. No.

1:23:14.291 --> 1:23:17.708
No, not-- not really drawing either, so…

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:20.625
Okay…

1:23:21.625 --> 1:23:24.125
-Angie, thanks so much for coming!
-Hi!

1:23:24.208 --> 1:23:25.291
Excuse me.

1:23:25.375 --> 1:23:26.291
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:23:26.375 --> 1:23:27.875
-Wait. What?
-I know.

1:23:27.958 --> 1:23:31.500
-I need to leave. I can't be here anymore.
-What? We just got here.

1:23:31.583 --> 1:23:33.083
Hold on. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1:23:33.166 --> 1:23:36.583
No. It's getting sad and pathetic
that I'm trying to explain to these people

1:23:36.666 --> 1:23:39.083
that my life did not turn out
the way that I planned.

1:23:39.166 --> 1:23:41.333
-Can we go? Please?
-Brag about the good parts.

1:23:41.416 --> 1:23:43.250
What good parts? Dude, come on!

1:23:43.333 --> 1:23:44.333
Are you kidding me?

1:23:44.416 --> 1:23:46.166
We always talked about
living in LA together.

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:47.666
-And we're literally doing it.
-Yeah.

1:23:47.750 --> 1:23:50.458
I'm gonna be living with you until I'm 40
because I'm broke,

1:23:50.541 --> 1:23:52.583
I just lost my job,
I'm single, I'm gonna die alone.

1:23:52.666 --> 1:23:54.708
Cara, I need to go home, please.

1:23:58.625 --> 1:23:59.625
I'm going.

1:24:09.875 --> 1:24:11.958
Good night,
little night owl.

1:24:39.166 --> 1:24:43.500
You were actually very smart
to not attend this baby shower.

1:24:43.583 --> 1:24:45.041
It was a true nightmare.

1:24:46.291 --> 1:24:48.041
-I couldn't do it.
-Hmm.

1:24:48.125 --> 1:24:49.666
Nothing inside of me could--

1:24:50.291 --> 1:24:52.250
I just couldn't. I could not.

1:24:52.333 --> 1:24:54.541
-Uh…
-It's okay.

1:25:00.666 --> 1:25:01.875
I'm sorry.

1:25:03.375 --> 1:25:05.458
About LA. How I left.

1:25:06.750 --> 1:25:11.625
So far away, and I couldn't handle
this Gabe situation.

1:25:12.375 --> 1:25:14.541
-I didn't handle it well, and I'm sorry.
-Yeah, uh--

1:25:14.625 --> 1:25:15.625
Hey, listen.

1:25:16.583 --> 1:25:17.708
It is really okay.

1:25:19.583 --> 1:25:20.416
For real.

1:25:22.708 --> 1:25:24.208
I want him to be happy.

1:25:25.625 --> 1:25:28.125
He's gonna do his thing.
I'm gonna work on my shit.

1:25:28.208 --> 1:25:33.208
This is just an opportunity
for me to… focus on myself,

1:25:33.291 --> 1:25:36.041
my daughter, my work.

1:25:37.166 --> 1:25:39.333
You're so lucky
you have something you love.

1:26:35.750 --> 1:26:38.333
-Hey, sneaky girl.

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:40.083
-Can I see the next one?

1:26:40.166 --> 1:26:42.500
-I haven't drawn the next one yet.

1:26:42.583 --> 1:26:44.000
Well, what are you waiting for?

1:26:44.083 --> 1:26:46.916
This is so cute.
This is the best thing you've ever done.

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.375
-Maybe if it becomes something,

1:26:49.458 --> 1:26:51.708
I can submit it to some festivals
or something.

1:26:51.791 --> 1:26:53.041
-Fancy.

1:27:26.250 --> 1:27:28.583
-Oh my God! Look at you!
-Hi!

1:27:28.666 --> 1:27:31.083
Daddy came to say hi on your first day.

1:27:31.166 --> 1:27:32.708
-Hey.

1:27:32.791 --> 1:27:34.000
Come on. Give me a high five.

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:36.208
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

1:27:36.291 --> 1:27:38.541
-Mm!
-Okay! Okay.

1:27:39.125 --> 1:27:40.916
You're gonna have the best day.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000
-They have a slide!
-They do have a slide.

1:27:43.083 --> 1:27:44.000
Go on. Go play.

1:27:44.083 --> 1:27:45.416
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:49.250
-Hi!

1:27:49.333 --> 1:27:52.125
I actually have a, um…
an early wedding gift.

1:27:52.208 --> 1:27:53.708
Oh, no.

1:27:53.791 --> 1:27:56.750
I didn't follow your registry.
Sorry, but, um… Just…

1:27:56.833 --> 1:27:59.083
-Oh wow!
-Oh!

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:00.750
-Dampers for my drums.
-Mm-hmm.

1:28:01.708 --> 1:28:03.833
And for you, noise-canceling.

1:28:04.666 --> 1:28:06.791
-You're so kind. Thank you.
-Mm. Thanks.

1:28:06.875 --> 1:28:08.541
-Um…

1:28:08.625 --> 1:28:11.625
Oh, okay. I'm gonna take this,
but I'll see you guys later.

1:28:11.708 --> 1:28:12.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:29:11.125 --> 1:29:12.666
I have something to show you.

1:29:13.250 --> 1:29:14.750
-Okay, you do?
-Mm-hmm.

1:29:14.833 --> 1:29:17.166
All right. I'm assuming it's this way.

1:29:17.666 --> 1:29:19.541
Mm.

1:29:20.291 --> 1:29:22.083
Oh my God, Nat. That's…

1:29:23.583 --> 1:29:24.583
that's beautiful.

1:29:24.666 --> 1:29:27.666
Thank you.
And there's something else.

1:29:28.375 --> 1:29:29.208
What?

1:29:30.666 --> 1:29:33.916
I was asked to be on a panel
at South by Southwest.

1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.166
-What?
-Yeah.

1:29:36.250 --> 1:29:38.375
It's nothing fancy,
but it's some animators…

1:29:38.458 --> 1:29:40.416
-Local talent--
-Are you kidding me? That's crazy!

1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:43.416
-Wow, are you-- Nat. Oh my God.

1:29:43.500 --> 1:29:44.750
-Yeah.
-That's…

1:29:46.958 --> 1:29:48.291
Yeah, yes.

1:29:48.375 --> 1:29:54.375
It's… happened very fast
after happening very slowly.

1:29:54.458 --> 1:29:55.291
Yeah.

1:29:57.500 --> 1:30:01.625
Well, I'll-- I'll be there,
and Rosie will too.

1:30:01.708 --> 1:30:03.000
Mm-hmm.

1:30:05.083 --> 1:30:06.416
Our manager, he's actually…

1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:08.958
He's trying to set us up
with a gig at South-by, also.

1:30:09.041 --> 1:30:12.791
So we'll try to maybe
line up, uh… the same weekend.

1:30:12.875 --> 1:30:15.166
Your band is gonna play South-by?

1:30:15.916 --> 1:30:16.875
Trying to.

1:30:18.875 --> 1:30:20.958
I would love to see you play again.

1:30:22.708 --> 1:30:23.666
I'd love that.

1:30:32.041 --> 1:30:33.208
Hi, Jake.

1:30:34.208 --> 1:30:37.166
I was hoping that I would reach you,
but, um… but it's okay.

1:30:39.791 --> 1:30:42.833
I just wanted to let you know that

1:30:43.750 --> 1:30:46.750
a short that I made got into South-by.

1:30:48.416 --> 1:30:49.666
And, um…

1:30:51.208 --> 1:30:54.833
I'm really excited and, uh, proud, so…

1:30:57.250 --> 1:30:59.000
I think you're the one person in my life

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:01.875
who really understands
what this means to me.

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:04.916
So I just wanted to let you know.

1:31:14.916 --> 1:31:16.333
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:31:20.125 --> 1:31:22.583
Oh my God. Give me a spin.

1:31:23.166 --> 1:31:24.791
Should I shave my hair off?

1:31:24.875 --> 1:31:26.750
-Do you like it?
-I love it!

1:31:26.833 --> 1:31:28.250
-You do?
-Yes!

1:31:28.750 --> 1:31:30.083
-Over here!
-Yeah!

1:31:46.875 --> 1:31:47.833
Yeah, next.

1:31:47.916 --> 1:31:49.791
Hi. Natalie Bennett.

1:31:53.666 --> 1:31:54.833
Here you go.

1:31:54.916 --> 1:31:55.916
Thank you.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.208
You're welcome.

1:31:59.666 --> 1:32:01.458
-Hi!
-Natalie Bennett.

1:32:04.125 --> 1:32:06.166
Here you go. That's yours.

1:32:06.250 --> 1:32:08.375
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1:32:09.541 --> 1:32:11.666
So you mentioned that <i>Night Owl</i>

1:32:11.750 --> 1:32:15.083
was inspired
by your daughter's bedtime routine.

1:32:16.125 --> 1:32:20.500
Yeah. So the first few months,
she was basically nocturnal.

1:32:20.583 --> 1:32:22.791
We were out of our minds,
and somewhere in there,

1:32:22.875 --> 1:32:24.833
we started calling her
our "little night owl."

1:32:24.916 --> 1:32:25.875
-Aww!
-There--

1:32:25.958 --> 1:32:28.333
Normally, there was
an expletive thrown in there.

1:32:28.416 --> 1:32:32.208
"Our little bleeping night owl!"
Cover your ears, baby.

1:32:32.291 --> 1:32:34.375
-She's so cute.
-Thank you.

1:32:34.458 --> 1:32:39.041
Uh, anyways, her dad and I would joke
that she must be having anxiety

1:32:39.125 --> 1:32:41.916
about all the things
she had to do the next day,

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.750
and it became a whole routine

1:32:43.833 --> 1:32:49.208
where she was our overwhelmed,
stressed-out little zoot-suit-wearing owl,

1:32:49.291 --> 1:32:51.083
and it was an inside joke.

1:32:51.166 --> 1:32:52.875
We thought it was hilarious,

1:32:52.958 --> 1:32:55.625
but we weren't sure if anyone else
would really find it amusing.

1:32:55.708 --> 1:32:59.166
For myself, I do know
what it feels like to stay up all night

1:32:59.250 --> 1:33:03.125
worried about the hundred things
that I have to take care of the next day.

1:33:03.208 --> 1:33:05.750
Well, you can always call me
because I'm always awake.

1:33:05.833 --> 1:33:07.625
-Okay. Maybe I'll do that!

1:33:07.708 --> 1:33:09.583
-Great!
-It's so lovely to have you here today.

1:33:09.666 --> 1:33:11.458
-Go, Mom!
-Thank you, I appreciate it.

1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:22.958
-Hey, isn't that, um… Gabe's old band?
-Yeah.

1:33:23.041 --> 1:33:25.041
Oh my God. Let's go in.

1:33:52.625 --> 1:33:54.125
I can't believe--

1:34:02.708 --> 1:34:06.791
Oh my God. Whoa! What's up? How are you?

1:34:06.875 --> 1:34:08.000
Good to see you.

1:34:08.083 --> 1:34:09.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:34:10.875 --> 1:34:11.916
Bennett?

1:34:12.708 --> 1:34:15.541
Holy shit! It's been what? Five years?

1:34:15.625 --> 1:34:16.500
Yeah.

1:34:16.583 --> 1:34:17.791
-Mm!

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:19.666
Oh!

1:34:20.791 --> 1:34:22.416
-Hi.
-Wow.

1:34:26.958 --> 1:34:28.541
-This is crazy.
-I know.

1:34:28.625 --> 1:34:32.250
I've been seeing all of your tour updates
and all the things

1:34:32.333 --> 1:34:35.125
-'cause you're famous now.
-No, no, no, no.

1:34:35.875 --> 1:34:38.708
And how-- how are you?
How's drawing? How's everything?

1:34:39.291 --> 1:34:40.333
Uh…

1:34:40.416 --> 1:34:43.083
I have a short
premiering here tonight, actually.

1:34:43.166 --> 1:34:45.083
-No shit?
-Yeah.

1:34:45.666 --> 1:34:46.541
-Seriously?
-I do.

1:34:46.625 --> 1:34:47.791
-Seriously? Wow!
-Mm.

1:34:47.875 --> 1:34:50.666
I saw that you are engaged.

1:34:50.750 --> 1:34:53.125
Congratulations.

1:34:53.208 --> 1:34:54.375
Married.

1:34:55.791 --> 1:34:57.125
-No.
-Yeah.

1:34:57.208 --> 1:34:58.916
You're a married man!

1:34:59.000 --> 1:34:59.916
I am.

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:00.958
Wow.

1:35:01.875 --> 1:35:03.250
-We're pregnant.
-No!

1:35:03.333 --> 1:35:05.083
-Yeah.
-You are?

1:35:05.166 --> 1:35:07.708
This is-- That's-- It's--
Yeah. It's crazy.

1:35:07.791 --> 1:35:09.500
I have to tell you something.

1:35:09.583 --> 1:35:11.000
-Um…
-Mm-hmm?

1:35:12.375 --> 1:35:14.166
You remember graduation night?

1:35:14.250 --> 1:35:15.208
Mm-hmm.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.666
I took a pregnancy test that night.

1:35:21.291 --> 1:35:25.166
-Oh…
-Which would have been…

1:35:26.916 --> 1:35:29.833
Yeah, yeah.
It would have been mine. And-- and--

1:35:29.916 --> 1:35:32.375
-I wasn't-- I was not! I'm sorry! Sorry!
-Oh, okay! Okay.

1:35:32.458 --> 1:35:34.083
-No, I was not.

1:35:39.166 --> 1:35:41.625
-You're gonna be such a good dad.

1:36:00.583 --> 1:36:03.000
-They're great!

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:27.708
Who is this man?

1:36:28.291 --> 1:36:30.666
-There he is! Look at this guy!
-Hey!

1:36:30.750 --> 1:36:32.666
Why did you keep this from me?

1:36:32.750 --> 1:36:35.583
I didn't! I told you guys
from the first day I was a drummer.

1:36:35.666 --> 1:36:38.791
-I did not believe you.
-You said I was a dry cleaner.

1:36:39.375 --> 1:36:41.500
Unreal. Way to go.

1:36:41.583 --> 1:36:43.458
-Say "good job!"
-You want a beer? Beer?

1:36:43.541 --> 1:36:45.458
-I'll take her.
-Yeah. Okay. Go with Gramps.

1:36:45.541 --> 1:36:49.375
-Oh my God! Oh, there she goes.
-You wanna get a little tiny beer? Okay.

1:36:50.125 --> 1:36:51.333
You were amazing.

1:36:51.416 --> 1:36:53.500
-Mm… I was a little rusty.
-No.

1:36:53.583 --> 1:36:54.541
Mm.

1:36:55.708 --> 1:36:58.958
Where's Miranda? Is she gonna…
I thought she was gonna be here.

1:37:00.291 --> 1:37:03.500
Uh… we… we ended things.

1:37:04.250 --> 1:37:06.041
-What?
-Yeah. It just…

1:37:07.291 --> 1:37:09.333
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1:37:11.250 --> 1:37:12.291
Yeah, I'm good.

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.500
It was rough for a couple weeks,
obviously, but, um…

1:37:20.708 --> 1:37:21.875
She just wasn't you.

1:37:28.125 --> 1:37:30.625
Does anybody have
a spare ticket to this thing?

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:32.458
That they're--
Tickets that they're not using?

1:37:32.541 --> 1:37:36.000
Extra tickets? Anybody have a ticket?
Do you have a ticket you're not using?

1:37:36.083 --> 1:37:37.833
-Extra ticket, maybe?
-No, I'm sorry.

1:37:37.916 --> 1:37:40.958
Does anybody have a spare ticket
they might be willing to give me?

1:37:41.041 --> 1:37:41.875
Jake?

1:37:43.791 --> 1:37:44.708
Hi.

1:37:45.291 --> 1:37:46.500
Wow, you look…

1:37:49.375 --> 1:37:50.333
Hi.

1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:55.166
What are you doing here?

1:37:55.250 --> 1:37:58.541
Well, uh… I was trying to surprise you.

1:37:58.625 --> 1:38:00.666
This is not exactly how I planned this.

1:38:00.750 --> 1:38:02.458
-Yeah.
-But my flight got delayed in Toronto.

1:38:02.541 --> 1:38:05.125
I just got here.
I didn't expect it to be sold out.

1:38:05.208 --> 1:38:08.000
It's sold out.
That's tremendous! Well done!

1:38:08.083 --> 1:38:10.791
You… came here for…

1:38:12.375 --> 1:38:13.916
Your work let you come here?

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.000
Oh, no, no. Yes, technically, they did,
but, um… they weren't happy about it.

1:38:18.083 --> 1:38:22.666
A lot of, uh… lot of angry conversations.
A couple of angry phone calls.

1:38:22.750 --> 1:38:25.041
One or two angry voice mails
I think I'm gonna have

1:38:25.125 --> 1:38:27.375
when I turn my phone back on.

1:38:27.458 --> 1:38:28.833
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1:38:28.916 --> 1:38:30.083
Mm.

1:38:32.916 --> 1:38:34.458
And I got your voice mail.

1:38:36.166 --> 1:38:37.250
And the truth is,

1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:41.875
I'd rather be here for you
than anywhere else in the world for me.

1:39:14.333 --> 1:39:15.458
-That was…
-Natalie!

1:39:15.541 --> 1:39:16.791
Miles to go…

1:39:17.416 --> 1:39:18.583
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

1:39:18.666 --> 1:39:19.958
Uh, I'm sorry…

1:39:20.041 --> 1:39:23.333
Hi, Lucy. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

1:39:23.416 --> 1:39:26.166
Oh, I was on a panel earlier,
and I saw your name on the program.

1:39:26.250 --> 1:39:28.083
I wanted to come and say hello.

1:39:29.166 --> 1:39:32.000
-I appreciate that. Thank you.
-Mm.

1:39:34.583 --> 1:39:36.083
I know I was hard on you.

1:39:36.625 --> 1:39:39.625
In the same way that people
were hard on me when I first started.

1:39:41.791 --> 1:39:43.125
It's a hard industry.

1:39:43.791 --> 1:39:44.833
It is.

1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.375
I could have done more.

1:39:49.916 --> 1:39:52.958
You know, maybe you did
exactly what I needed you to do.

1:39:53.541 --> 1:39:56.750
Well, either way, you found your voice.

1:39:57.333 --> 1:39:59.125
-I'm very proud of you.

1:40:01.916 --> 1:40:03.666
I wondered if you'd consider

1:40:03.750 --> 1:40:06.125
coming by my office
when you get back to Los Angeles,

1:40:06.208 --> 1:40:09.208
because I'd love to see
what you're working on next.

1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:15.166
Yes. Yes! I would love that.

1:40:15.250 --> 1:40:16.750
Thank you, Lucy.

1:40:16.833 --> 1:40:18.500
-You're welcome.

1:40:19.458 --> 1:40:21.041
-I'll see you then.
-Yes.

1:40:23.708 --> 1:40:26.750
Do you remember
the last time we were on this bridge?

1:40:26.833 --> 1:40:28.750
Mm-hmm. Where it all started.

1:40:29.625 --> 1:40:31.291
Where it all started.

1:40:33.833 --> 1:40:35.708
That night, you said…

1:40:37.625 --> 1:40:39.458
that you would be there for me.

1:40:40.833 --> 1:40:45.416
And you have been, every step of the way.

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:46.625
Well, I've tried my best.

1:40:46.708 --> 1:40:49.375
Well, you've been the greatest partner
in all of this.

1:40:49.458 --> 1:40:52.083
-Oh, stop it.
-No, I'm not gonna st--

1:40:52.166 --> 1:40:53.125
No.

1:40:54.458 --> 1:40:58.458
You know, I've told myself all this time
that we should not be together…

1:41:00.125 --> 1:41:02.875
because maybe we were
holding each other back from something,

1:41:02.958 --> 1:41:06.958
and If things didn't work out, it would be
too complicated with Rosie, but I…

1:41:09.125 --> 1:41:11.416
I don't want to worry about
if it doesn't work out,

1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:13.375
because what if it does?

1:41:14.416 --> 1:41:20.166
And I have been so stupidly
in love with you this whole time.

1:41:25.750 --> 1:41:26.791
Finally.

1:41:27.541 --> 1:41:28.750
Finally?

1:41:31.250 --> 1:41:32.083
Finally?

1:41:32.166 --> 1:41:33.208
Finally.

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:42.916
Wow.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.750
-That's so cool.

1:41:46.708 --> 1:41:48.416
Can you wait here for two seconds?

1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:49.833
-Are you gonna go in?
-Yeah, yeah.

1:41:49.916 --> 1:41:51.291
-Will you hold these?
-Okay. Yeah.

1:41:51.375 --> 1:41:53.083
