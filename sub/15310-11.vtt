00:01.669 --> 00:03.904
Oh, Doug!
Hi, how are you?

00:03.937 --> 00:05.306
I'm good.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.475
Hey, your fiancé scored
three goals today.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.043
Yeah, only because of
this guy's assists.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.045
Hey. Hey, everybody,

00:11.079 --> 00:12.313
I want you to meet
my mate, Doug.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.914
Hey. Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Doug.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.484
Doug, this is Kate.
I mean I'm Kate, hi...

00:16.517 --> 00:17.851
Hello, Kate.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.187
Hi.
Uh, look, I'm
double-parked.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.589
I just wanted to come
and say hey, Jules.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.690
But nice to meet you all.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.657
Hey, thanks for
the ride, mate.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.895
Well, he seems
like a nice guy.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.098
Easy on the eyes, too.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.435
What?

00:34.468 --> 00:37.004
What, so finding another man
sexy makes me gay?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.573
It's the first step
on the journey.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.113
He just moved here.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.214
He doesn't know
that many people.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.015
He's such
a catch, too.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.118
Hey! Do we know anyone
we can set Doug up with?

00:50.151 --> 00:52.186
Hmm.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.088
Bobby, what about Jill,
the labor and delivery nurse?

00:54.122 --> 00:55.756
She just
got engaged.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.791
Mm. Oh, what about
your cousin Courtney?
Moved to Florida.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.196
Oh, my God, Kate.
I am so sorry.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.397
Ah.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.065
Do you know anybody who
would be good for Doug?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.900
Yes. Me! Me!

01:06.934 --> 01:09.737
I would be good for Doug!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.272
Oh...

01:11.305 --> 01:12.640
Yeah...

01:14.575 --> 01:15.609
No.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.445
What?! Why not me...?

01:17.478 --> 01:20.047
No, no. It's just that
Doug's such a nice guy

01:20.080 --> 01:24.252
and we want him to be,
you know... happy.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.589
Excuse me?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.391
It's just that, every time
we set you up with somebody,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.092
you invent some
ridiculous reason

01:32.126 --> 01:33.427
why the guy
isn't good enough.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.464
Too tall, too short,
weird earlobes,

01:36.497 --> 01:38.732
eats a banana with
a knife and fork.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.435
It's a handheld fruit.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.172
Kate, we have put ourselves
on the line for you.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.573
I mean, we've lost friendships.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.008
We've been put in awkward
situations. We're done.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.610
Now, are you
gonna finish that?

01:52.012 --> 01:54.415
So let me get
this straight,

01:54.448 --> 01:58.152
you've all decided
that I am un-setup-able?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.520
No, it's nothing personal.

01:59.553 --> 02:03.090
We love you as a friend
but, romantically...

02:03.123 --> 02:04.625
uh...
how do I say this?

02:04.658 --> 02:07.495
We wouldn't wish you
on our worst enemy.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.649
Are these
yours or mine?

02:31.219 --> 02:32.553
Does it even matter?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.190
No, you're the man.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.792
All right,
I'll see you later, buddy.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.663
Who are you
talking to?

02:42.696 --> 02:43.731
Craig.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.965
Who's Craig?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.133
Your neighbor, C-Dog.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.736
Oh, you mean
Blue Prius Guy.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.038
Ah, right, the one married
to Only Wears Turtlenecks.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.373
Mm.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.342
She has a name.
And it's Lisa.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.745
And, be kind, she's
got a very unsightly mole.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.713
How do you know so much
about our neighbors?

02:59.747 --> 03:01.549
Uh... I talk to them.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.084
Well, that has
gotta stop right now.

03:05.553 --> 03:09.089
Will, we have worked
very hard to create a bubble,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.091
to insulate ourselves
from the neighbors.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.026
All right? We don't
want any obligations.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.161
No obligations.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.162
Or surprise stop-bys.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.364
Oh, hate the stop-bys.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.998
And we definitely
don't want to be asked

03:18.031 --> 03:19.567
to babysit a cat
with diarrhea.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.103
God, I do not
miss the Brenners.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.205
C-Dog and Lisa
are not the Brenners.

03:25.239 --> 03:29.109
Give 'em access, and any
neighbor can be the Brenners.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.744
What, so I can't be neighborly?

03:30.778 --> 03:32.580
Sure, buy
your own house.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.815
Get to know
your own neighbors.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.118
Ooh, these are sexy.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.853
When'd you get these?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.389
Last week.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.028
Okay, that was
the moving company.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.397
They're gonna deliver
the rest of my stuff

03:49.430 --> 03:50.864
from storage tomorrow.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.900
Aw... and then we'll be
officially moved in together.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.302
I know.
Aw...

03:56.136 --> 03:57.671
Ugh, do you mind?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.208
No, I guess it is
presumptuous of us

04:01.241 --> 04:03.277
to express affection
in our own home.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.413
I'm off to work anyway.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.914
I'll see ya later.
Mm-hmm.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.224
What's this?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.926
My résumé as a person.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.296
28 reasons why
I am setup-able.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.332
You're kidding, right?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.435
Oh. Okay.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.072
"Does not perspire."

04:32.105 --> 04:33.841
"Open to booty calls."

04:33.874 --> 04:36.810
"Perfect sized nipples"?

04:36.844 --> 04:39.279
Like Canadian quarters.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.916
Still, he's a really
good friend of Lowell's,

04:42.950 --> 04:45.085
and if things go wrong,
it could get really awkward.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.656
Okay. I know in the past, I've
been a little particular.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.791
Ridiculously picky...
Okay, fine...

04:50.824 --> 04:54.695
but I just really want
to meet a great guy,

04:54.728 --> 04:58.599
and if even my closest friends
think I'm un-setup-able,

04:58.632 --> 05:01.969
then what chance
do I have at happiness?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.771
My God, you're persuasive.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.772
Yeah.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.974
It's there under
"Special Skills."

05:07.007 --> 05:08.842
Right above
"No gag reflex."

05:11.545 --> 05:13.347
When will this party end?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.950
Honey, come here for a sec.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.218
Is that Will?

05:18.251 --> 05:19.787
Of course it is.
Look at how the moonlight

05:19.820 --> 05:22.022
is reflecting off
his massive forehead.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.660
Bubble-popping
son of a bitch.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.340
You're still glowing.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.379
I'm sorry, but it was
C-Dog's 40th birthday.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.481
I specifically
told you

05:47.515 --> 05:49.216
to stay within the confines
of the bubble.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.184
Yeah, I know, but...

05:51.218 --> 05:53.220
I like being a part
of the community.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.655
Whe-When Val got
the house in the divorce,

05:54.688 --> 05:57.157
she also got all the neighbors.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.492
I'm a neighborhood guy.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.260
Well, as long as you're
living under this roof,

06:00.293 --> 06:02.730
you're a bubble guy.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.664
I had to go.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.399
The whole neighborhood
was there.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.735
Yeah, we don't care
that the whole neigh...

06:07.768 --> 06:10.438
Wait, the whole
neighborhood was there?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.506
Why weren't we invited?

06:12.540 --> 06:16.276
Uh, be... cause
nobody likes you.

06:16.309 --> 06:20.247
How could
they not like us?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.516
Who cares if
nobody likes us?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.551
I do!

06:23.584 --> 06:25.085
It's one thing
if we exclude them,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.421
but another
if they exclude us.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.889
Oh, boy.
Here we go.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.791
They are gonna like us.
Ooh, they are gonna like us

06:30.824 --> 06:32.860
even if I have to
shove us down their throat.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.095
And you know why?
You want to know why?

06:35.128 --> 06:37.731
Because we are
a frickin' delight!

06:48.308 --> 06:51.411
Well, that's everything.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.683
In the world?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.652
Well, I-I guess we're
gonna have to get rid of

06:58.686 --> 07:01.188
some stuff.
Your stuff.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.926
Call us when
you lose, buddy.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.734
Hi, Craig.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.069
I'm Andi McAllister
from next door.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.405
I know who you are.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.908
I, um, I brought you
some cookies.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.577
Lisa!

07:23.611 --> 07:25.479
Always Pregnant Lady's here!

07:25.513 --> 07:29.583
The one married
to Ginger Balls?

07:29.617 --> 07:32.520
Hi, yes. I was just
coming by to bring over...

07:32.553 --> 07:33.787
Hi. Lisa, right?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.756
I brought you
some cookies.
Interesting.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.691
I brought cookies over
when you moved in.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.093
As I recall,
when I rang the doorbell,

07:40.127 --> 07:41.962
you hid behind the couch.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.598
Like a child.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.934
Well, the point is
I'm here now.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.803
And I, I really want
to be a better neighbor.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.873
Well, she did
walk over here.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.174
And...

07:54.207 --> 07:56.510
carrying that load
can't be easy.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.846
Thank you, C-Dog.
It is not.

07:58.879 --> 08:02.015
Fine. If you really
want to get involved,

08:02.049 --> 08:05.285
as block captain, I know a lot
of ways you could help out.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.454
Well, Captain...

08:07.487 --> 08:09.523
call on me if you need
anything.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.191
You know where I live.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.832
You're handsome,

08:18.866 --> 08:21.902
successful, no kids
that you know of.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.506
Is there anything wrong
with you?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.810
You know, I'm really glad
Lowell gave me your number.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.546
I'm glad, too.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.082
I'm more glad.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.220
And there it is.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.222
What do you mean,
he was too nice?

08:42.255 --> 08:46.860
Ugh, I mean he's complimentary
and accommodating

08:46.894 --> 08:51.198
and just so happy to be with me.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.534
What a bastard.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.205
You are unbelievable.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.908
I went out on a limb and
convinced Lowell to set you up,

09:00.941 --> 09:04.111
because you swore
you wouldn't do this.

09:04.144 --> 09:09.683
He gave me a soft
forehead kiss good night.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.118
Kate, has it ever
occurred to you

09:11.151 --> 09:13.854
that maybe the problem
isn't with these guys?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.055
Maybe it's you?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.692
It doesn't seem likely.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.028
Look, you can't make
a decision about someone

09:21.061 --> 09:22.229
after just one date.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.297
I mean, do you know
how many things about Bobby

09:24.331 --> 09:25.933
bothered me on our first date?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.567
She farted.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.244
But we gave it a second chance.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.883
Come on, you guys
really think it's me?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.652
Yes!

09:48.455 --> 09:50.590
Okay. Well, wh-what
about this poster?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.560
Do we like that poster?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.395
Uh, I thought we did.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.764
Do we not?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.835
I think maybe we think
it's a little dated.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.107
What do you say we throw it
in the discard pile?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.642
Okay.
Okay.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.848
Hey! Oi!
Hey.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.583
Hey! Ooh, is this
the sorority stuff

10:16.616 --> 10:18.251
I was storing
at your house?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.319
I don't look inside.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.587
I'm just the mule.
Here you go.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.657
Old T-shirts.
Lobster bibs.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.326
And a fork.
Yeah.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.427
Discard pile?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.762
No! Are you kidding?

10:28.796 --> 10:31.131
That fork and I have been
everywhere together.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.035
These are treasured memories.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.603
Uh, yeah, but yesterday
you made me throw away

10:36.636 --> 10:39.139
my high school diploma.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.077
And that was a decision
we made together.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.980
Oh, yeah.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.850
It looks like the whole merging
process is going seamlessly.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.785
Yeah, it is.
All right, listen closely,

10:51.819 --> 10:53.620
we don't have a lot of time.
What are you
talking about?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.822
Let me guess: This is the
discard pile, right?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.323
And it's all your stuff.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.625
No. We made a decision together,
that it was best for us...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.460
No. "We."
"Together." "Us."

11:00.493 --> 11:02.495
Those are all code words
that they use

11:02.529 --> 11:05.332
to make their ideas
seem like yours.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.968
That doesn't sound
like Jules.
No.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.302
This has Andi written
all over it.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.670
She must have spoken to her.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.205
The only thing I have left
from my former life

11:12.239 --> 11:15.142
is a Barcalounger in the garage
that a raccoon had babies in.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.978
Lowell, honey, do we
really need this cricket bat

11:18.011 --> 11:20.147
with all the signatures
all over it?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.715
Uh, honey, those are
actually the autographs

11:21.749 --> 11:24.484
of the entire Australian
national team and...

11:24.517 --> 11:27.254
Oh, my God, Bob.
You're right!

11:28.221 --> 11:29.589
She's been working me!

11:29.622 --> 11:31.091
Reclaim your stuff.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.493
Stand up for yourself
and be a man.
Okay.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.661
All right, I gotta go.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.163
I gotta buy Andi
some string cheese

11:36.196 --> 11:37.865
and a hemorrhoid pillow.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.769
This is my life.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.350
No...

11:57.384 --> 12:00.253
I can't find a flaw.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.923
Okay.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.358
Uh, Doug, why don't you tell me
more about you?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.860
You know, something unexpected

12:06.894 --> 12:09.529
I might have missed
on the first date.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.531
Oh, okay.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.367
Um, I'm very close
with my mum and dad.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.568
Uh-huh.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.939
I love making collages...

12:18.972 --> 12:21.008
as you will soon discover.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.311
And I cry freely.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.882
Okay,

12:28.916 --> 12:31.051
now don't look.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.954
What am I drawing on your hand?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.391
A heart?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
With wings.
Oh.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.735
What the hell is all this?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.237
It's for the spring block party.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.106
You mean that thing
we always leave town for?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.142
Yeah. This year you're doing
the face-painting booth.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.245
Pew, pew, pew!
Pew, pew, pew!

13:00.613 --> 13:02.149
That's Lisa and Craig's son.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.516
We're watching him
while Lisa takes her
father-in-law

13:03.550 --> 13:04.852
to get his colonoscopy.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.320
Pee-Paw has a polyp.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.689
Now, Henry, we don't
know that. See, there was

13:09.722 --> 13:11.358
some blood in Pee-Paw's
stool, but we know...

13:11.391 --> 13:13.593
All right, you know what?
This is a nightmare, all right?

13:20.133 --> 13:20.934
Who's that?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.369
Oh, that's Tucker.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.104
Tom and Gina's dog.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.639
And while you're watching
the dog and watching Henry,

13:26.673 --> 13:27.607
who's watching our son?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.509
Oh, he's at my mom's.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.045
Sweetheart, would you mind
going out and getting me
some more glitter pens?

13:32.079 --> 13:33.947
Yes, I would mind.
I'd mind very much.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
Andi, take a look around.
The bubble is gone.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.119
Finally, it feels
like a real home.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.990
Hey, Ginger Balls,
more popcorn!

13:44.992 --> 13:47.360
Ginger Balls, please.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.467
It's not me, it's him!
I gave him a second chance,

13:54.501 --> 13:57.137
and he held my face. I'm out!

13:57.170 --> 13:58.305
Kate!

13:58.338 --> 13:59.672
No, no, no,
you know what?
It's fine, actually,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.509
'cause Doug's not into you,
either.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.811
What?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.846
He said he didn't feel a spark.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.749
I don't understand.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.485
He's not interested
in you.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.322
So what are you saying?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.824
He did not like you.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.426
But look,
there's no harm, no foul.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.693
I mean, what are you
gonna do?

14:20.727 --> 14:22.529
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.164
I am going to call him.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.598
Why?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.334
Off the fact
that he could sit there

14:27.367 --> 14:31.271
with no interest and put on
all that phony niceness.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.440
That... is hot.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.545
I thought you said
Doug liked her.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.380
Oh, he's crazy about her.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.451
And you knew if you told her
that he didn't like her,

14:44.484 --> 14:46.686
that would make her call him.
You are good!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.521
I want my chair back.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
No.
Okay.

14:53.626 --> 14:57.730
Nice TV.
How big is that TV?

14:57.764 --> 14:58.898
I don't know.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.600
What would you say, 55?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.770
Sure, 55.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.306
There's no way
that's 55.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.943
Andi, this is fantastic.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.979
You are such a godsend.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.313
Bobby, did you hear that?

15:13.346 --> 15:14.514
I'm a godsend.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.550
I bet it's 47.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.486
Okay, it's 47.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.257
Come on. If you think it's 55,
just stick up for yourself.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.229
I almost forgot.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.232
Bobby, all the face-painters
wear costumes.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.735
So here is your clown suit.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.904
Never gonna happen.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.473
I'll take that for him.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.575
Well, the flyers are up.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.577
Hi, Will.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.247
Or should I say "Mr. Cornhole"?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.184
It's the game with the beanbags.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.420
Oh. Mm-hmm.
The... Yeah. I'm running it.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.587
Mm.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.656
So, did I hear that Evelyn
is in the hospital?

15:56.689 --> 16:00.493
She's having another
"knee surgery."

16:02.129 --> 16:03.430
Which reminds me.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.165
Andi, would you like to take
over her duties

16:05.198 --> 16:06.799
as editor
of the block newsletter?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.869
The Whitley Whisper?

16:09.902 --> 16:12.672
Lisa, I-I would love to.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.207
Fantastic.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.677
Bobby, your wife could be
block captain some day.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.153
Oh, FYI, your dog crapped
in the hallway.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.954
I don't have a dog.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.323
Well, you have a crap.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.397
How'd you lose more stuff?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.132
You were supposed
to take a stand!

16:39.166 --> 16:40.633
Yeah, I know.
I tried, okay?

16:40.667 --> 16:41.968
But she can be
very persuasive.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.038
She had sex with me!

16:48.341 --> 16:49.309
Hey, guys!

16:49.342 --> 16:51.811
See what I'm up against?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.546
Hey.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.681
So, baby, on my run,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.583
I was thinking about
what you said.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.850
And you're right.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.387
Why do we need your
wicker footstool?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.355
Oh, no, I'm not...

17:04.757 --> 17:06.659
Okay.
Uh, stop!

17:06.693 --> 17:08.161
Just go get
a cup of coffee.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.529
I'll take care of this.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.298
Okay.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.167
What's going on, Bobby?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.369
Jules, sweetheart,
it's me, okay?

17:16.403 --> 17:18.838
We both know what
you're doing to Lowell.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.039
And it may fly
with Lowell,

17:20.073 --> 17:21.674
but I've been married
a long time,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.543
and it's not gonna
fly with me.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.777
You feel me?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.282
Oh, no...
Hey, hey, no, don't...

17:29.316 --> 17:31.751
Bob...

17:31.784 --> 17:33.420
what happened to all my stuff?

17:33.453 --> 17:37.390
Hey, look, the good news is,
you're still living here.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.560
Why are they taking
your sweater?

17:40.593 --> 17:42.429
Well, Jules and I talked,

17:42.462 --> 17:47.234
and we agreed that purple
isn't our best color.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.113
Do you feel a spark now?

18:00.147 --> 18:02.282
I have since
the moment we met.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.984
Oh, it's okay, I know
that's not true.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.886
No, really, it is.

18:06.919 --> 18:11.324
But I thought you
weren't interested.

18:11.358 --> 18:15.228
I have
always been interested.

18:15.262 --> 18:19.199
Then I have been lied to.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.101
Kate...

18:22.135 --> 18:26.306
would you like
to... make love?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.013
Why don't I put
some music on?

18:34.046 --> 18:37.417
I made a playlist
of romantic songs.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.653
It's called
"Songs for Lovemaking."

18:42.622 --> 18:44.391
Okay.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.130
Ugh! How can somebody be
so incredibly desirable

18:51.164 --> 18:53.800
and repulsive
at the same time?

18:53.833 --> 18:57.036
He'd be the perfect guy
if he just didn't talk.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.139
Why does he have to be
so damn nice?!

19:01.208 --> 19:04.177
So he just went straight
for a rear delivery?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.279
Can you believe?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.381
Total sneak attack!

19:10.483 --> 19:13.520
You do not attack from the rear
without warning.

19:13.553 --> 19:17.023
Right?! I mean,
it's at least a discussion

19:17.056 --> 19:20.260
and probably a nice piece
of jewelry.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.363
Jules, show them
your bracelet.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.398
Not now.

19:32.572 --> 19:36.976
So, did you go
through with it?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.311
Of course not!

19:38.345 --> 19:40.012
I never got the appeal.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.315
I mean, why vacation in Newark

19:42.349 --> 19:45.585
when Manhattan
is just a bridge away?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.588
Because when someone
tells you

19:48.621 --> 19:51.758
that under no circumstance
can you go to Newark,

19:51.791 --> 19:55.161
all you can think about
is going to Newark.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.565
You're never
going to Newark.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.499
Kate, I gotta say,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.501
I did not expect
that from Doug.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.337
Yeah, well, I gotta run.
I'm meeting him for a drink.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.607
Wait-- you're gonna go out
with him again? Even after...?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.843
Absolutely.
Clearly I misjudged him.

20:10.877 --> 20:15.214
A truly nice guy wouldn't have
that in his repertoire.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.719
I kind of want to see
where this thing is gonna go.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.624
I think we all know
where that thing is gonna go.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.933
You guys have
a lot of nerve!

20:33.966 --> 20:35.402
Andi, it's for you.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.205
You and this stupid newsletter
got my house robbed!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.107
What?! Why
would you say that?

20:41.140 --> 20:44.877
"Hey, neighbors,
Craig and Lisa are spending
a long weekend in San Francisco.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.781
Let's keep a Whitley Street
Watch on their empty house."

20:48.815 --> 20:51.718
Yeah, I could see
why you'd say that.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.886
The neighborhood association
has voted,

20:53.920 --> 20:56.222
and you've been banned
from all block activities.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.759
And that goes for you,
too, Mr. Cornhole!

21:03.430 --> 21:05.998
Looks like we're
back in the bubble.
