WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:01.502
[birds chirping]

00:01.585 --> 00:03.962
- Daddy,
don't forget the popsicles.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.048
- We were supposed
to bring popsicles?

00:08.675 --> 00:10.010
You are not my child.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.976
<i>Before kids, you have</i>
<i>a strong sense of identity</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:20.145
<i>based on, you know,</i>
<i>your hobbies and interests.</i>

00:20.229 --> 00:22.231
- ASTRID:
<i>The bands you like or your job.</i>

00:22.314 --> 00:23.690
- JAMES:<i> But as you focus</i>
<i>on raising kids,</i>

00:23.774 --> 00:27.361
<i>it feels like</i>
<i>you become more generic.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:29.947
- ASTRID:<i> People see you</i>
<i>as just another mom or dad.</i>

00:34.076 --> 00:36.870
Mrs. Jellinek wrote
an entire recipe book?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.705
This is so elaborate.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.249
This kid made enchiladas?

00:40.332 --> 00:41.375
VIV: That's Gerardo.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.795
He stepped on my shoe
but he wants to get married.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.755
- Just tell Gerardo
to slow his roll.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.423
<i>You hope some part</i>
<i>of your identity</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:49.883
<i>lives on through your kids,</i>

00:49.967 --> 00:52.302
<i>your ethnic and cultural</i>
<i>heritage for example,</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:54.137
<i>but, uh, even that can get lost.</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.557
All these recipes
are so traditional.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.644
And we made
Rice Krispie Treats.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.770
Viv?

01:01.854 --> 01:02.938
What?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.857
- Why does
it say you're Indigenous,

01:04.940 --> 01:06.024
you're part Indian.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.193
- VIV: We don't use
that word anymore.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.570
We are Indian.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.364
- You're not
supposed to say that.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.456
Hey, Felix, great game.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.457
Hey, what do you say, Felix?

01:22.541 --> 01:23.959
- Thanks, coach.
- Yeah.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.878
You know, I'm really--I'm really
surprised we beat Green

01:25.961 --> 01:28.338
because, you know,
they're a lot better than Red.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.299
Well, they didn't have Felix.
He's our secret weapon.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.384
Yeah. Secret weapons,
they run in our family.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.678
I was pretty good.
My dad was a homerun king

01:34.761 --> 01:36.555
and Mom, very athletic.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.307
Felix's mom, not my dad's mom.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.267
But she can jump really high.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.351
- Dad.
- Yeah.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.728
You know, we have
the same batting stance.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.271
He knows it's all in the legs.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.564
- It goes like this.
- Okay.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.191
See you next game, slugger.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.776
- Yeah, yeah. We'll see you.
We'll be there.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.737
Hey, what do you think about
Berney bats for us...

01:51.820 --> 01:53.488
and just call each other that

01:53.572 --> 01:55.532
like, like Joey Bats, you know.
How's that sound?

01:55.616 --> 01:56.867
- FELIX: Dad?
- JAMES: Uh-hmm?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.160
When is baseball over?

01:58.243 --> 01:59.786
What? What do you mean
when's baseball over?

01:59.870 --> 02:02.456
- Season just started, pal.
- My tummy hurt the whole game.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.333
- You get two homeruns
on a bad tummy,

02:04.416 --> 02:05.834
that's like the Jordan flu game.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.339
Hey.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.382
You know, I had a bad tummy too
before games sometimes,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.635
- you know what really helped?
- Um, not playing?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.011
Something more delicious.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.014
- Ice cream!
- Yeah! Small scoop though.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.266
Sensitive gut
also runs in the family.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.101
Let's go, buddy!

02:23.185 --> 02:25.521
- All right. What are
we reading tonight, huh?

02:25.604 --> 02:26.813
Something with a real story,

02:26.897 --> 02:28.732
something that's not
about a licensed toy?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.401
- Read my cookbook!
- Ah, your cookbook. Yes.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.195
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your cookbook.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.113
- I'm in a real book,
like Barbie.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.240
Or like a scientist.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.325
Okay.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.495
So I'm part Indian, which again,
is different than Indigenous.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.372
And because I'm part Indian,

02:43.455 --> 02:45.165
that means
that you're part Indian too.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.417
People from India are Indian.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.962
- Dad is Indian?
- ASTRID: No, not Daddy,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.673
but Felix
and, and Dawn auntie and Corey.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.800
- Uncle Bo's
a citizen of the world.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.510
- Yeah.
Uncle Bo's also from Winnipeg.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.636
- And I'm from India.
- ASTRID: Well, you're not

02:57.719 --> 02:59.137
from India exactly.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.556
Nanima was born in England,

03:00.639 --> 03:02.474
but her parents
were born in India.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.643
And you and me are part Indian.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.103
I thought we were Canadian.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.271
ASTRID: Yeah, we are.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.982
It also is important
where your family lived.

03:10.065 --> 03:13.151
So if Charlotte
from Karate lived in India,

03:13.235 --> 03:14.570
she would be Indian too?

03:14.653 --> 03:17.531
- Charlotte from Karate lived
in India for like 10 years,

03:17.614 --> 03:18.782
and then did a lot of paperwork.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.951
She could technically
become a citizen, I guess.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.953
But being Indian is...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.123
not skin color.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.374
If you like spicy food?

03:27.457 --> 03:31.128
- Sure. Yes. Yup.
Let's go with that. That one.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.921
So a quick recap,

03:33.005 --> 03:37.050
you are English, Scottish,
and East Indian, and Canadian.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.886
And I'm a cat named Ocean.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.139
- Indian Ocean?
- VIV: No.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.277
- So the ethnicity talk
went well?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.904
I confused us both so much.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.239
- Viv forgot she was even human.
- Uh-hmm.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.242
- ASTRID: What's that for?
- Felix.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.912
Our big guy is carrying
the whole team on his shoulders

04:04.995 --> 04:06.788
- and it's upsetting his tum-tum.
- Yeah.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.749
He barely even
touched his dinner, poor guy.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.292
- Pre-game jitters
runs in the family.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.711
All elite athletes get them.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.339
- Do all elite athletes
also get knee pain from driving?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.633
- We are both
sensitive stomached athletes.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.717
It happens all the time.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.220
Cowboy Cerrone,
he puked before every big fight.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.347
Glenn Hall,
notorious pre-game vomiter,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.599
and Bill Russell the goat,
he hurled before every big game.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.310
- But those people
are paid to puke.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.895
Felix is supposed
to be doing this for fun.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.857
- And throwing up
makes room for all the fun.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.442
Don't say that to our kids.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.697
- MS. JELLINEK: Out you go, Viv.
Sorry you had to wait.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.574
Took her a while
to find her coat.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.701
- Yeah, that's not her coat,
or her shoes.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.827
Oh no.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.163
Viv, go find your things.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.166
- She does that sometimes.
- It's cool.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.709
Some of the stuff
she brings home is pretty nice.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.127
- She also pretends
to feed sandwiches

04:54.211 --> 04:55.337
to her shoes sometimes.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.631
As long as no one's eating glue,
I feel pretty good.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.259
- Yeah, totally.
She's, she's also really cool

05:00.342 --> 05:02.386
and smart,
and strong, right?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.012
She's great.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.682
- Love the class recipe book,
by the way.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.350
I just had one small issue.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.562
- Sometimes an eggplant emoji
just means eggplant, you know?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.729
Uh, no.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.191
I think--I think Viv told you
that she was Indigenous.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.819
She's not.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.029
I just--I would hate
for anyone to be offended.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.949
So if you wouldn't mind,
reprinting Viv's page--

05:24.032 --> 05:27.244
- Can I be real with you?
I paid for the printing myself.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.497
Crazy, I know,
but we are severely underfunded.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.875
Did you get
my email about donating pencils

05:32.958 --> 05:34.710
- and spare Kleenex?
- It's just one page.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.879
- Exactly.
Parents are only gonna read

05:36.962 --> 05:38.463
their own kid's page, right?

05:38.547 --> 05:40.424
You probably can't even name
another recipe from the book.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.343
- Well, the pasta puttanesca
really stood out.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.471
That's Italian
for pasta of the prostitutes.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.724
- Yeah.
- Look, maybe we just remove

05:48.807 --> 05:50.434
Viv's page from the book.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.352
- What?
- ASTRID: Hey,

05:52.436 --> 05:54.104
nice coat. It's a keeper.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.607
I wanna be in the book.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.900
All right. New plan.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.985
If I pay for the printing,

06:00.068 --> 06:02.404
can you make sure that gets to
all the other parents? Please?

06:02.487 --> 06:06.241
- Can you sweeten the deal
with, say, some Kleenex?

06:06.325 --> 06:10.037
- Yes.
We failed you as a society.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.246
Hmm.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.547
- ASTRID: Is it
gonna be much longer, Dawn?

06:20.631 --> 06:21.548
DAWN: Not much,

06:21.632 --> 06:24.593
but it's important
to prepare sushi properly.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.970
I heard about a man
who developed an infection

06:27.054 --> 06:30.098
from eating tainted sushi
and had his arm amputated.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.308
I'm gonna eat my own arm.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.726
COREY: Knowing the history

06:32.809 --> 06:36.146
feeds the stomach and the mind.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.524
- Speaking
of super authentic meals,

06:38.607 --> 06:40.484
I was actually thinking
that I should teach the kids

06:40.567 --> 06:41.777
one of our traditional
family recipes.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.112
Rice Krispie Treats?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.990
They were your favorite.
The secret's the Rice Krispies.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.034
- Uh, no. I was thinking
chana bhaturas.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.410
- NISHA: And smell up
the house with frying?

06:50.494 --> 06:51.703
Just order from Little India.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.080
Hey, Viv, dining room.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.623
- Okay.
- BO: Yo. I help Corey

06:54.706 --> 06:55.791
with his cooking videos.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.209
I can teach you
to make a mean aloo gobi.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.210
- Nope.
- Big no.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.586
How are we supposed
to pass on traditions

06:59.670 --> 07:01.129
if we don't know what they are?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.549
- Oh, please.
Soon, everybody will intermarry

07:03.632 --> 07:05.217
and everyone
will be the same shade of tan

07:05.300 --> 07:06.718
and everyone
will eat nutrition pills.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.387
That sounds terrible.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.596
Except for the pills part,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.640
I would literally
eat anything right now.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.683
I mean it.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.976
Look at us.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.186
Hey, that's a family tradition.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.646
White husbands.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.815
Am I a fetish?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.483
- Don't you feel like
we're dropping the ball

07:21.567 --> 07:23.819
- on our heritage?
- Your name is Astrid

07:23.902 --> 07:25.487
from Scandinavia.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.990
I'm named after
Tony Orlando's backup singers.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.700
We're not the ones
who dropped the ball.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.160
- Well, you know what?
I--I'm picking the ball back up.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.955
I'm going to teach Viv
how to make chana bhaturas

07:35.038 --> 07:38.125
and other important things.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.459
Hey, Felix.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.045
When is your baseball
game tomorrow?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.131
Baseball's boring.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.591
- No. Wait, wait.
What do you mean?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.301
We're, we're having
such a great time together,

07:47.384 --> 07:49.303
and you're so good at it.
He's amazing.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.682
- Fine.
Let's go to stupid baseball.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.519
It's tomorrow, pal.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.272
Stupid baseball is tomorrow.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.735
- ASTRID:<i> You feed</i>
<i>your kids to help them grow</i>

08:04.818 --> 08:06.361
<i>and because</i>
<i>you're legally obligated.</i>

08:06.445 --> 08:07.863
<i>But there's</i>
<i>no law that makes kids</i>

08:07.946 --> 08:10.741
<i>eat the food that you serve,</i>
<i>so a lot of it gets wasted.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:14.453
- JAMES:<i> There's so much</i>
<i>science about which foods</i>

08:14.536 --> 08:16.663
<i>have what nutrients, but you</i>
<i>can make a whole food pyramid</i>

08:16.747 --> 08:18.248
- <i>of the stuff, they won't eat.</i>
- ASTRID:<i> Oh, God.</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:19.458
<i>Food that touched on the plate</i>

08:19.541 --> 08:21.293
<i>and uneaten snacks</i>
<i>from school lunches.</i>

08:21.376 --> 08:23.712
<i>Stuff that was too hot,</i>
<i>or too green, or too mushy.</i>

08:23.795 --> 08:25.380
- JAMES:<i> Stuff they didn't eat,</i>
<i>but we saved them</i>

08:25.464 --> 08:27.716
<i>to eat later but then forgot</i>
<i>about and it went bad,</i>

08:27.799 --> 08:28.842
- <i>and that one's our fault.</i>
- ASTRID:<i> Yeah.</i>

08:28.926 --> 08:30.469
<i>You make chicken tenders</i>
<i>and fries</i>

08:30.552 --> 08:32.137
<i>three nights a week</i>
<i>because they love it.</i>

08:32.221 --> 08:33.805
JAMES:<i> Nope. Viv hates that.</i>
ASTRID:<i> Oh.</i>

08:35.015 --> 08:37.935
- NISHA: Oh, ho, ho, ho. You're
missing Corey's talent show.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.936
I know.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.396
Uh, Mom, I was serious
about making the chanas.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.190
- Can I have the recipe?
- There's no recipe.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.234
I can tell you the ingredients
and how to cook it.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.568
- That's literally
what a recipe is.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.320
- Yeah. But no, no,
it won't be right.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.405
I don't know measurements,
you taste as you go.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.824
Why don't you
come over with the kids?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.284
We'll spend the day
together cooking and,

08:54.368 --> 08:55.994
and Corey can turn it
into one of his videos.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.246
No, God. No, no, no.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.705
I didn't want it
to be this big thing.

08:58.789 --> 09:02.042
I just want it to be this--
this very special intimate,

09:02.125 --> 09:04.211
passing down
family wisdom moment

09:04.294 --> 09:07.297
that Viv can look back
on years from now and think,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.508
"God, she was a good mom.
What a good mom."

09:09.591 --> 09:10.592
Do you have any of those

09:10.676 --> 09:12.344
what a great mom
memories with me?

09:12.427 --> 09:13.720
- Uh-hmm.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.097
Recipe, please.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.516
- <i> Bitoo</i>, Indian-cooking
is all about instinct.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.476
I'm Indian. I have instincts.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.398
Overshot the wasabi.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.816
Oh, my brain!

09:27.192 --> 09:28.068
Yeah.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.612
Look at that aim.

09:30.696 --> 09:31.738
Heads up.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.076
Do I have to play baseball?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.619
- No, you don't have
to play baseball.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.162
I just thought
maybe you wanna play catch,

09:39.246 --> 09:40.372
but only if you want.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.665
Okay.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.168
- Okay. Actually, I don't know
if I can play baseball

09:44.251 --> 09:46.003
because I have a little crink in
my back and it's bothering me.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.546
Wait.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.257
What? What's that?
Heads up.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.467
So Felix Berney.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.971
Fans wanna know.
Baseball.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.599
Do you hate it,
and is it your dad's fault?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.685
- I don't hate baseball.
- Yes, it's fun, right?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.353
I guess. It's just...

10:03.437 --> 10:05.189
Sometimes
I wanna do other things.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.774
- Right.
Like how Dennis Rodman

10:07.858 --> 10:10.110
would wrestle for the WWE
just for a change of pace.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.445
Who did what?

10:13.322 --> 10:14.406
Sands of Time,

10:14.489 --> 10:16.408
buried a lot
of unique treasures.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.411
My point is,
I don't wanna force you

10:19.494 --> 10:20.579
to do something
you don't wanna do,

10:20.662 --> 10:23.165
but also I don't want you
to give up something

10:23.248 --> 10:25.250
that might give you
years of pleasure

10:25.334 --> 10:27.127
just because you're like
a little bored of it.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.756
Oh, my God.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.216
Did you see that?
That curve.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.468
- Curve dance.
- JAMES: Yeah. There we go.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.928
Now we're having fun.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.638
Okay, high heater coming in.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.682
Felix?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.941
Do they sell freezies?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.734
What's all this weird stuff?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.111
- It's not weird, sweetie,
it's Indian.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.579
Uh, excuse me.
Can you help me?

11:02.663 --> 11:04.873
Um, I'm looking
for ground cilantro.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.166
Oh, wait,
that's not the right word.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.377
It's not coriander.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.379
Tip of my tongue.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.588
Dhaniya.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.298
Ground dhaniya,
where can I find that?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.175
I don't know. I don't work here.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.885
- I'm sorry. I just thought--

11:16.969 --> 11:18.470
I know what you thought.

11:18.554 --> 11:22.307
[speaking foreign language]

11:22.391 --> 11:25.227
- I wasn't being racist.
I was just being stupid.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.981
Like wearing a red vest
at a store you don't work at.

11:30.065 --> 11:34.027
Oh, what you get there,
my little<i> bitoo?</i>

11:34.111 --> 11:36.864
Something for Nana G?

11:36.947 --> 11:38.699
Can I buy these big chips?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.374
Meow. Meow.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.460
- Excuse me.
Where's the international aisle?

11:50.544 --> 11:51.962
Next one over?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.172
You work here, right?

11:53.255 --> 11:54.631
Yeah.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.884
- ASTRID: Yeah. Some people
are just vest people.

11:58.260 --> 12:03.182
Uh, so do they have
ground dhaniya, cori--cilantro?

12:03.265 --> 12:05.142
Damn it. Is it all over there?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
All spices
are in the international aisle,

12:07.477 --> 12:09.146
except for these.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.607
- ASTRID: Salt, pepper,
and everything

12:11.690 --> 12:13.358
bagel seasoning.
Yup. That tracks.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.113
All right, Kitty.
Let's travel abroad.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.624
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.375
- I thought you were going
to an Indian grocery store?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.252
- Yeah, I did.
- Well,

12:32.336 --> 12:34.963
- but this is from Gero's.
- Uh, doy, James?

12:35.047 --> 12:37.341
I got this stuff from Gero's
because we're a Gero's family.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.550
- Hey.
I thought we talked about this.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.593
The doys are for others.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.347
- Where's Viv?
- She's using the litter box.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.350
- You know,
I am respecting her commitment.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.101
- I know.
- Well, well, how do we--

12:48.185 --> 12:49.561
what can--how can I help?
Where--what--how I--

12:49.645 --> 12:50.854
I don't know.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.940
I think what I'll do
is just access

12:53.023 --> 12:55.025
the deep well of information
from my ancestors

12:55.108 --> 12:56.360
from around the world.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.613
- Google. I see.
- Google.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.740
- You know what?
I hear is an excellent resource.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.367
Delicious Corey's kitchen.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.285
- Let's do that. Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.497
<i>Today, me and daddy</i>

13:08.580 --> 13:11.625
<i>are gonna make</i>
<i>authentic Indian aloo gobi.</i>

13:11.708 --> 13:13.418
- Namaste,<i> Corey.</i>
- Namaste,<i> Daddy.</i>

13:13.502 --> 13:15.254
- I hate it. No.
- Sorry. So sorry. My bad.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.421
- I think
I'm just gonna wing it.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.048
- Yeah.
- Me, Viv,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.342
our Indian instincts
making chana bhaturas.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.052
- And I'm gonna follow
my instincts

13:22.135 --> 13:24.012
by having the phone tell me
the directions to Felix's game.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.722
- I believe in you.
- Nah you.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.520
- NISHA:<i> Hello?</i>
- Hi, Mom.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.151
Okay. Let's do this!

13:40.320 --> 13:41.363
Time to go, pal.
What's happening?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.198
You in the zone?

13:43.282 --> 13:45.576
- Am I distracting you?
- My toes are itchy.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.786
- Okay. I think that's
a solvable problem.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.246
Let's get out there
and scratch them toes.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.293
You sure that's all
that's bothering you, buddy?

13:54.376 --> 13:57.087
- I just don't feel
like playing, Dad.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.548
- Okay. Okay.
I understand that. I do.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.175
But perseverance
is also important

14:01.258 --> 14:02.509
and we've never
beaten Blue before,

14:02.593 --> 14:03.594
and they're very smug.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.222
So I just wanna
make sure that you're sure.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.349
Are you mad?

14:09.433 --> 14:11.852
No, no. Son, no.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.646
I just want you to find
something that you love,

14:14.730 --> 14:16.064
doesn't have to be baseball.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.192
Could be dancing.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.443
I wanna drive a tank.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.530
- Okay. I'll see
if there are lessons for that.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.115
- Let's just go home.
- Okay.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.909
- Okay. I gotta just
quickly tell your coach

14:26.992 --> 14:28.619
- that we're not coming.
- Hey, guys.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.954
We're gonna beat Blue today.
I can feel it.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.164
My guy.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.376
- You know,
let's just go straight home.

14:38.337 --> 14:41.423
- Okay. The base of all good
Indian cooking is the masala.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.091
Great. What is in that?

14:43.175 --> 14:45.594
Tomatoes, onion, jeera.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.554
- As far as quantity
is concerned,

14:47.638 --> 14:50.098
I know we're using
our instincts and my instinct

14:50.182 --> 14:53.685
is telling me a quarter
teaspoon of ground jeera.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.146
Half a teaspoon. One spoon.
Give me a clue, woman.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.065
- I'm half-Indian.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.316
You don't say.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.943
Okay then, half.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.529
- That's very cute.
She's actually a quarter.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.113
So is it actually a quarter?

15:05.197 --> 15:06.698
- Dawn, I need you
to chop more ginger.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.699
DAWN: On it.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.451
So exciting.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.913
Do I smell a crossover
with Delicious Corey's Kitchen.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.206
- Looking good,<i> bitoo.</i>
- ASTRID: Mom, Mom.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.667
- You gotta wait for me.
- Chulas wait for no one.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.461
- Okay, Viv, what's next?
- Um, let's see.

15:20.796 --> 15:21.880
These.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.383
- What is that?
- Chilies, and garam masala.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.134
- DAWN: Bo makes
some spicy mango cocktail

15:26.218 --> 15:28.345
- with garam masala.
- Oh, that sounds horrible.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.596
- It's not great.
- ASTRID: But hold on,

15:29.680 --> 15:31.723
can we just--because I--Mom,
I need to know the amounts

15:31.807 --> 15:32.766
and you're going too fast.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.601
Can I put these in?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.520
- NISHA: Yup. Go ahead,<i> bitoo.</i>
- ASTRID: You don't--Mom,

15:36.603 --> 15:38.105
this whole thing
would be a lot easier

15:38.188 --> 15:39.898
if you bothered to teach us
when we were kids.

15:39.982 --> 15:43.360
- Wow. I'm glad I'm the one
holding the knife. [groans]

15:43.443 --> 15:46.196
- VIV: I want to put
Rice Krispies in.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.031
- Viv, we gotta
follow the recipe,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.658
- whatever the hell that is.
- But to be fair,

15:49.741 --> 15:52.244
- she did try to teach us.
- No, she didn't.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.414
- Yes, I did, but you girls
never wanted to learn.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.499
Every time I said
we were having Indian food,

15:57.583 --> 15:59.251
there'd be
such moans and groans.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.461
You said you wanted hotdogs
and macaroni and cheese

16:01.545 --> 16:03.046
- like your friends.
- Not all of the time.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.965
- When are we making
Krispie Treats?

16:05.048 --> 16:06.091
- Wait. Viv, not now.
- No, no, no.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.010
We would have
Indian food once a week,

16:08.093 --> 16:09.761
but you were embarrassed
of the smells

16:09.845 --> 16:11.263
and the yellow fingernails,

16:11.346 --> 16:13.599
and said you wanted
to eat normal food.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.434
So, one day I just stopped.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.813
- Viv, Viv, Viv. No.
Don't, Viv...

16:31.325 --> 16:33.702
- NISHA: Leave it.
We can start over.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.454
ASTRID: Let's just forget it.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.998
It's not like Viv is gonna eat
the chanas anyway.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.583
Why would she?

16:39.666 --> 16:42.127
Most Indian thing
we have is chai.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.379
- It's from Starbucks.
- It's not a big deal.

16:44.463 --> 16:45.839
Maybe not for you, Mom.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.008
You go out in the world
and people know who you are.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.635
Those people at the Indian store

16:49.718 --> 16:51.220
did not even know
that I was Indian.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.180
And they did think
that I was racist.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.474
- Calling them
those people doesn't help.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.480
I get called exotic.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.607
Which means pretty
but not quite why.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.526
- Well, that describes me
to a T.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.736
- You think
I don't have to prove myself,

17:07.819 --> 17:10.364
a brown woman
in the Western world?

17:10.447 --> 17:14.451
<i>Beta, </i>who cares
about everybody else?

17:14.535 --> 17:17.913
I know exactly who you are,
my daughter,

17:17.996 --> 17:21.166
strong, independent,

17:21.250 --> 17:23.085
unable to cook in two cultures.

17:23.168 --> 17:26.213
- Well, I burnt pad thai,
so, make that three.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.470
Excuse me.
I gotta go apologize to a cat.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.183
Hey, Viv.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.234
Meow. Meow, meow.

17:49.278 --> 17:50.988
Well, I guess Viv left.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.574
Oh, well, at least I get
to keep all her toys.

17:53.657 --> 17:56.118
No, you can't. I'm right here.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.620
- There you are.
- I'm sorry I messed up.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.664
Hey, you didn't.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.583
I'm the one
who made a mess of things.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.171
Rice Krispie Treat?

18:07.254 --> 18:10.966
- I know these aren't Indian
but I really like them.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.968
- You know,
my dad used to make these

18:13.051 --> 18:14.219
for me when I was little.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.889
- Was he Indian?
Can dads be Indian?

18:16.972 --> 18:19.808
- My dad wasn't Indian,
but--but some dads are,

18:19.892 --> 18:21.435
like, half a billion of them.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.562
They're my favorite.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.647
Mine too.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.482
When I used
to make them with my dad,

18:27.566 --> 18:29.359
he would let me mix
in all the marshmallows

18:29.443 --> 18:31.778
and sometimes we'd throw in
some special treats

18:31.862 --> 18:33.655
like chocolate chips
or licorice all sorts,

18:33.739 --> 18:35.115
which are disgusting.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.993
But the rainbow sprinkles, woo!

18:38.076 --> 18:39.828
Can we put cookies in?

18:39.912 --> 18:41.330
- We can throw
whole chocolate bars in.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.998
Yes.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.000
- You know how I told you
that you were English,

18:45.083 --> 18:47.252
- and Scottish, and Indian?
- Uh-hmm.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.755
- Well, you are
all those things.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.965
But I forgot to tell you
that you are something

18:52.049 --> 18:53.550
that's totally
different than me,

18:53.634 --> 18:54.843
or Daddy, or Nanima.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.386
You're you.

18:57.596 --> 19:01.141
And there's nobody
on planet Earth who is like you.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.644
<i>Becoming a parent</i>
<i>is a massive shift in identity.</i>

19:03.727 --> 19:05.771
You can't escape
the tickle monster!

19:06.813 --> 19:10.275
<i>Your name changes to mom</i>
<i>or dad like almost overnight.</i>

19:10.359 --> 19:14.655
Viv, I blamed your dad
for eating these.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.532
- JAMES:<i> Your life turns</i>
<i>into talking about your kids,</i>

19:16.615 --> 19:18.700
<i>following them around,</i>
<i>collecting pictures of them.</i>

19:18.784 --> 19:20.536
- ASTRID:<i> It's like being</i>
<i>obsessed with a K-pop group.</i>

19:20.619 --> 19:22.829
- JAMES:<i> Yeah, it sucks</i>
<i>to lose some of your identity.</i>

19:22.913 --> 19:24.289
- ASTRID:
<i>But it's amazing to watch</i>

19:24.373 --> 19:25.832
<i>your kids develop theirs.</i>

19:25.916 --> 19:27.876
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm busting a move.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.044
What does
it look like I'm doing?

19:29.127 --> 19:31.755
- Stop, Daddy.
- What? I can't--I can't stop.

19:31.839 --> 19:34.550
- What--what's happening?
- You have to pop your hip.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.301
- I have to the pop my hip?
How do I do that, like that?

19:36.385 --> 19:38.011
- You're doing great.
- Thanks, buddy.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.263
Now, shimmy.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.685
- ASTRID: Why are you limping?
- I shimmied too hard.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.603
- So are we ordering
pizza or what?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.605
DAWN: No need.<i> Voila!</i>

19:48.689 --> 19:50.816
- I added a little of this,
a little of that.

19:50.899 --> 19:54.069
It's not what we were going for
but it's pretty good.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.487
And it smells delicious.

19:55.571 --> 19:56.989
- The secrets
the Rice Krispies.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.866
I want one.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.742
- What is--this is amazing.
What do you call it?

20:00.826 --> 20:02.911
- I call them
hot sloppy Nishas.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.791
All right,<i> jaldee,</i>
let's eat before it gets cold.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.001
[snarls]

20:09.084 --> 20:10.127
[chuckles]

20:11.211 --> 20:14.006
- Hi, and welcome
to<i> Delicious Corey's Kitchen.</i>

20:14.089 --> 20:17.134
Today, I'm gonna show you
how to make pumpkin gnocchi

20:17.217 --> 20:20.470
with whipped ricotta
and burnt butter cashews,

20:20.554 --> 20:23.056
alongside
with my sous-chef, Mom.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.561
- That's right,
Delicious Corey.

20:27.644 --> 20:31.106
There ain't nothing hokey
about this gnocchi.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.525
Um, I couldn't find
any ethically sourced cashews,

20:33.609 --> 20:35.444
so I had to substitute walnuts.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.908
I'm gonna need a minute.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.452
It's okay.
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale...

20:43.535 --> 20:45.662
Um, we'll be right back.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.581
Bo. Bo, come quick.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.917
Corey is freaking out.
