WEBVTT

00:27.402 --> 00:30.239
Centurions, forward!

01:11.240 --> 01:16.160
In the year 41 B. C.E.,
as the Roman army invaded Egypt...

01:16.710 --> 01:19.750
...I, Cleopatra, last of the Pharaohs...

01:20.080 --> 01:23.590
...escaped upon the River Nile.

01:25.710 --> 01:31.300
My kingdom had fallen,
yet I was still Egypt's queen.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.770
Vowing to defend
the ancient treasure of my people...

01:35.770 --> 01:39.230
...I sailed for the pyramids.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.900
There, beneath the Great Sphinx,
lay a hidden tomb.

01:51.780 --> 01:56.660
An impenetrable maze of deadly traps
and secret dangers...

01:56.660 --> 02:00.210
...forever guarded by an ancient horror.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.750
The army of the undead.

02:05.750 --> 02:10.340
A thousand mummified warriors
awaiting the call to rise from the grave...

02:10.340 --> 02:14.300
...and defend Egypt's last great treasure.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.280
The ancient traps were set...

02:33.870 --> 02:36.870
...and the tomb sealed.

02:45.170 --> 02:49.010
Under the golden crown of Isis,
I cast my curse...

02:49.010 --> 02:54.220
...the curse of Cleopatra.
Let it be written.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.830
Jinkies.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.960
It's so beautiful.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.420
But what's it doing up here?

04:59.430 --> 05:02.560
Wait till Omar sees this.

05:05.220 --> 05:06.930
Not to worry, uncle.

05:06.930 --> 05:10.610
The Sphinx will be finished
in time for the unveiling ceremony.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.980
The restoration is in very good hands.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.820
Omar!

05:21.820 --> 05:26.410
Look, I found something.
It looks like an ancient necklace.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.620
What an incredible find.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.170
Oh, it was nothing.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.990
Impossible.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.710
Look.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.960
Velma, you found it.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.130
The lost tomb of Cleopatra,
hidden for thousands of years.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.470
Cleopatra?

06:26.060 --> 06:28.890
Double jinkies.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.320
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

06:36.820 --> 06:40.360
Man, Scoob, Egypt's a real hot spot.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.870
Guess while the lemonade is chilling,
we'll just have to chill.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.830
Yeah.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.880
How cool is it that Velma has spent
the last six months here in Egypt?

06:55.080 --> 06:57.840
Well, restoring the Great Sphinx
may be a thrill...

06:57.840 --> 07:01.260
...but I can't wait to see
the look on her face when she sees us.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.630
Yeah. "Surprise, Velma!"

07:03.630 --> 07:06.930
Velma? Surprise? Where, where?

07:07.220 --> 07:10.430
Sorry, Scooby. False alarm.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.060
Hang in there, big guy, we miss her too.

07:13.060 --> 07:17.060
But the good old Mystery Machine
will have us there in a jiffy.

07:23.150 --> 07:24.950
You were saying?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.290
Like, why are we stopping?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.540
Big trouble, gang.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.080
It looks like our radiator's out of water.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.260
Don't sweat it, Fred.
Scoob and I will go looking for snacks.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.970
I mean, help.

07:42.970 --> 07:45.470
Yeah, and snacks too.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.470
Water. Water.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.890
We're doomed, Scoob. We're doomed.

07:54.890 --> 07:55.770
Doomed.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.240
Our heroes.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.620
Hey, Scooby, look at that.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.210
Like, we're saved.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.130
Saved!

08:19.130 --> 08:22.000
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

09:10.090 --> 09:12.970
Do you think we should tell them
that it's only a mirage?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.730
Too late.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.660
Shaggy. Vultures.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.910
Vultures?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.000
Who would've thought
it could end like this?

09:40.000 --> 09:46.130
Scooby and Shaggy,
a baked buffet for a buzzard's breakfast.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.760
Wait a minute. That's no vulture.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.140
It's a hawk.

10:05.650 --> 10:08.440
Guys, look. I think we've got company.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.290
In Egypt, that means "hello."

10:17.290 --> 10:20.620
What up?
That means hello in America.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.670
Are we glad to see you!

10:23.670 --> 10:25.090
Indeed.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.630
I am Amahl Ali Akbar, at your service.

10:29.050 --> 10:33.090
Amahl Ali Akbar?
Wow, that's some name.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.310
Do you mind
if we just call you "Triple A"?

10:36.310 --> 10:39.220
We were on our way to the Sphinx
when our van overheated.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.640
Do you know where
we might find some water?

10:41.640 --> 10:46.150
I am sorry, my friend,
but there is no water here.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.900
Jeepers, what are we going to do?

10:48.900 --> 10:51.740
Come, join my caravan.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.490
We travel east, towards the
flowing waters of the Nile River.

10:56.830 --> 11:00.620
There you will find
what you are looking for.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.860
How much further to the Nile River?

11:31.150 --> 11:35.280
This is the Nile River.

11:36.030 --> 11:40.200
Okay. So, what happened
to the "river" part?

11:43.080 --> 11:46.420
Our journey together
has come to an end.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.420
I must find water for my camels.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.010
But how are we supposed
to get to the Sphinx?

11:52.010 --> 11:56.010
You have already arrived, my friend.
It is just over that hill.

11:56.010 --> 11:59.220
Big statue, pyramids in back.
You can't miss it.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.680
Well, thanks, Triple A.
Hope we see you again.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.810
If the Fates allow it, so shall it be.

12:08.810 --> 12:12.530
Okay, everybody,
remember where we parked.

12:20.910 --> 12:26.000
We made it, gang.
The pyramids and the Sphinx of Giza.

12:26.290 --> 12:29.630
- Isn't that cool?
- Oh, man.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.500
What a strange statue.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.260
It has the head of a man,
but the body of a lion.

12:36.260 --> 12:38.090
Good thing we're in the desert,
eh, Scoob?

12:38.090 --> 12:41.930
It must take a lot of sand
to fill that kitty's litter box.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.890
Litter box.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.730
Okay, tape is rolling.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.860
In five, four, three...

12:52.570 --> 12:53.940
Welcome to Fear Facers...

12:53.940 --> 12:57.030
...the show that looks in the face of fear
and faces it.

12:57.030 --> 13:00.910
I'm your host, Rock Rivers.
Behind me, the Nile River...

13:00.910 --> 13:02.620
...no relation.

13:02.620 --> 13:07.580
Wow, Fear Facers is the coolest!
I'm your biggest fan.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.000
Cut.

13:11.170 --> 13:15.800
- No, really. I've seen every episode.
- Come on, bro, I'm losing the light.

13:16.050 --> 13:18.300
Guys, this is Rock Rivers.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.970
Every week, he travels
to the world's scariest places...

13:20.970 --> 13:23.930
...Iooking for video proof
of the supernatural.

13:23.930 --> 13:28.770
Like, by supernatural, I sure hope
he means extra-organic granola.

13:28.770 --> 13:31.480
Did you say Fear Facers?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.270
It's okay, you can tell me.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.820
You love my show and you watch
it every week. Am I right?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.990
No. But I do read TV GAB. Look.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.160
Fear Facers cancelled?

13:43.160 --> 13:47.410
Okay, so I faked some footage.
Big deal, the ratings were huge.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.330
So, what are you doing in Egypt?

13:49.670 --> 13:52.330
Yeah, there's no fear
for you to fake here.

13:52.330 --> 13:56.170
You mean, you don't know
about the curse?

13:56.170 --> 13:58.590
The curse?

14:00.180 --> 14:01.470
It's all over the Internet.

14:01.470 --> 14:04.260
They've discovered a secret chamber
under the Sphinx...

14:04.260 --> 14:07.520
...and unleashed
some majorly sick mojo.

14:07.770 --> 14:11.350
Like, I think my mojo
is going to be majorly sick.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.610
Yeah. Mine too.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.030
If the curse is real,
I'll get proof of it on tape...

14:19.030 --> 14:21.860
...and then they'll have to
put me back on TV.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.330
What's gotten into Scooby?

14:29.330 --> 14:34.290
I think he's picked up something
on the old nose-radar. Come on.

14:34.290 --> 14:38.630
Hey, at least run screaming.
For the camera.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.320
Hey!

14:58.480 --> 15:02.400
Scooby, how did you get here?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.700
Okay, okay, I'm glad to see you too.

15:07.530 --> 15:08.660
Guys?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.410
What a surprise.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.540
I told you she'd be surprised.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.750
Boy, am I.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.920
But what are you doing here?

15:18.920 --> 15:20.920
Well, you know Scooby.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.260
He wouldn't stop howling
until we agreed to come and visit you.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.520
Scooby, are you sure
it was me you missed?

15:32.100 --> 15:34.520
Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks.

15:36.940 --> 15:39.270
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

15:39.270 --> 15:42.240
And, like, I missed you too, Velma.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.530
And Shaggy too!

15:45.780 --> 15:49.660
Isn't it great?
The gang's back together again.

15:49.660 --> 15:53.120
And, Velma, what a cute necklace.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.620
Oh, well, it's not really mine.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.630
It's an ancient Egyptian symbol
called an ankh.

15:58.630 --> 16:02.130
Someday it will go to a museum,
where it belongs.

16:02.130 --> 16:04.800
I don't really think
it goes with my outfit.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.800
Are you kidding?
Everything goes with khaki.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.720
Velma, what is going on here?

16:10.720 --> 16:14.310
You know this site is closed.
We must have no more intruders.

16:14.310 --> 16:17.480
It's okay, Omar,
these are my friends from America.

16:17.730 --> 16:19.060
Can it be?

16:19.060 --> 16:22.980
The teenage sleuths with whom
you've enjoyed so many adventures?

16:22.980 --> 16:25.650
Gang, this is Prince Omar Karam.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.450
He's the one in charge
of the restoration of the Sphinx.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.740
Please, forgive my rudeness.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.460
Ever since our discovery, we have been
besieged by treasure hunters.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.670
Treasure?

16:37.670 --> 16:40.460
- Can we see what else you've found?
- Yes, of course.

16:40.460 --> 16:44.760
But first, let me introduce you
to a close friend of mine.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.680
Khafra Ra-Atum...

16:47.680 --> 16:51.300
...or if you prefer,
the Great Sphinx of Giza.

16:51.300 --> 16:55.520
Carved out of the living rock
over 4000 years ago.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.190
- Hey, Daph, get a shot of this.
- Freddie.

17:01.440 --> 17:06.859
So, Your Highness, is there really
a secret chamber beneath the Sphinx?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.740
And what's all this about a curse?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.869
- We're not listening.
- No way.

17:13.869 --> 17:16.160
- We're not listening.
- Not listening.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.329
Guys, what are you doing?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.170
Like, we know where this is going.

17:20.170 --> 17:24.460
You've discovered some ancient tomb
and unleashed a horrible curse.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.800
Like, no offense,
Your High-Heightlyness...

17:26.800 --> 17:29.680
...but we don't wanna hear it.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.100
Wait, wait, hold on, guys.
What's that sound?

18:09.550 --> 18:12.550
Jeepers, did somebody order
a SWAT team?

18:14.970 --> 18:18.560
Just as I feared.
Velma, we must act quickly.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.620
The Great Sphinx.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.580
Nice kitty. Purr for Mama.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.340
Dr. Amelia von Butch.

18:45.340 --> 18:48.300
- Amelia von who?
- Butch.

18:48.300 --> 18:53.050
She's a notorious archaeologist
and world-class treasure hunter.

18:53.050 --> 18:56.140
You mean treasure thief.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.640
This is Prince Omar.
I must speak with my uncle.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.150
I'm sorry, but your call
has been disconnected. Permanently.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.780
Secure the perimeter. We work alone.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.410
Dr. Von Butch, you must
leave here at once.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.330
And you are...?

19:17.330 --> 19:20.660
Prince Omar Karam.
I'm in charge of this excavation.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.670
A prince. Charming.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.340
Now, out of the sandbox, kids.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.590
Playtime is over.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.970
Wait, you can't go in there.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.680
Watch me.

19:51.530 --> 19:54.110
Hello, gorgeous.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.030
This is awesome.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.370
Jeepers, who is that?

19:59.370 --> 20:05.500
The greatest woman who ever ruled.
Cleopatra, last of the Pharaohs.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.210
Atop her head,
she wears the golden crown...

20:08.210 --> 20:12.300
...and around her neck,
the ruby ankh necklace.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.550
Oh, Velma. That's just like your...

20:16.340 --> 20:20.510
I mean, wow, and I thought
I knew how to accessorize.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.930
The tomb itself is sealed.

20:23.930 --> 20:30.360
Imagine, the crown of Cleopatra
waits beyond this door.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.780
Please wait.
We have translated the hieroglyphics.

20:35.780 --> 20:37.490
"Thus spoke Cleopatra:

20:37.490 --> 20:41.740
'A curse on those who would defile
the secret tomb of the Pharaohs.'"

20:41.740 --> 20:45.960
"The Nile will fall
and the desert will rise.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.540
The army of the undead will awaken...

20:49.540 --> 20:54.170
...and all who enter
will be turned into stone."

21:00.890 --> 21:03.140
"The Nile will fall."

21:03.140 --> 21:06.850
Freddie, we saw the river ourselves.
It was completely dry.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.270
But what does
"the desert will rise" mean?

21:11.230 --> 21:14.030
And, like, "awaken the army
of the undead"?

21:14.030 --> 21:18.030
- Let's hope they have a snooze button.
- Yeah.

21:19.280 --> 21:23.620
Nice try, Cleo, but we didn't come
all this way to leave empty-handed.

21:25.160 --> 21:31.500
If there is an undead army down there,
our equipment will detect them.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.000
And they won't be undead for long.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.220
Please, Dr. Von Butch...

21:37.220 --> 21:41.680
...in the name of archaeology,
let us treat this tomb with respect.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.640
Its secrets will be revealed in time.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.560
I couldn't agree more.

21:47.980 --> 21:50.600
And there's no time like the present.

21:57.860 --> 22:01.990
She has just destroyed
2000 years of history.

22:01.990 --> 22:07.080
Don't worry, Omar.
If the curse can't stop her, we will.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.380
Like, that's the spookiest
stay-fresh seal I've ever heard.

22:14.380 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, me too.

22:37.820 --> 22:41.570
Hey, doc, I think you better come
check this out.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.170
Jeepers, what is that?

22:55.170 --> 22:58.550
Somebody tell me
that's just another mirage.

22:58.550 --> 22:59.960
Sandstorm!

22:59.960 --> 23:03.720
"And the desert will rise."
It is the curse.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.680
Okay, like, somebody else
tell me it's a mirage.

23:07.260 --> 23:11.350
Unload, now.
We need the geothermal sensors.

23:11.350 --> 23:17.440
- No, we must take shelter.
- Everybody back inside the tomb.

23:21.740 --> 23:24.490
Shaggy, Scooby, where are you?

23:24.740 --> 23:28.580
We don't know, but when we figure
it out, we'll send you a postcard.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.470
I never thought I'd hear
myself say this...

23:45.470 --> 23:49.430
...but, man, am I glad
to be back inside this creepy tomb.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.430
Me too.

23:51.640 --> 23:56.060
Hey, Omar.
Boy, are we glad to see you.

23:57.190 --> 24:01.280
Like, talk about giving a guy
the cold shoulder.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.610
He's been turned to stone.

24:06.160 --> 24:06.910
Stone?

24:10.830 --> 24:12.700
Guys, what are you doing?

24:12.700 --> 24:15.790
We're heading out
into the nice, safe sandstorm.

24:15.790 --> 24:18.420
- But why?
- Just look over there.

24:18.420 --> 24:22.170
Prince Omar and the Rock of Gibraltar
could be second cousins.

24:22.170 --> 24:25.010
Oh, no. Omar.

24:25.010 --> 24:29.640
Jeepers, he's been turned into
a royal statue.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.970
Impossible. How can this be?

24:32.970 --> 24:36.100
It's just like it said in the curse.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.360
"And all who enter
will be turned to stone."

24:39.360 --> 24:42.650
We tried to warn you.
Now look what you've done.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.440
We've got to do something.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.700
Stick with the plan.
I'm switching to night vision.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.540
Copy that. We are live.
Awaiting your signal, Dr. Von Butch.

24:58.370 --> 25:01.670
- Dr. Von Butch?
- Doc, it's now or never.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.590
- All right, on my signal.
- No.

25:05.590 --> 25:09.590
- What's it gonna take to stop you?
- Nothing short of an army.

25:09.590 --> 25:11.720
Move out.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.110
It's all downhill from here.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.450
But it doesn't make sense.
Why would the curse strike Omar?

25:36.450 --> 25:38.620
He only wanted to protect the tomb.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.670
Well, gang, it looks like we've got
another mystery on our hands.

25:42.670 --> 25:45.840
- No, Freddie, we don't.
- What?

25:45.840 --> 25:49.470
I'm sorry, gang,
but it's just too dangerous this time.

25:49.470 --> 25:53.850
If something were to happen
to you guys, I'd never forgive myself.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.720
Hold on.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.850
Did Velma just say that we're not
going to try to solve a mystery?

26:00.230 --> 26:03.400
Like, I still must have sand in my ears.

26:07.230 --> 26:11.410
But what about Omar?
We can't just leave him like this.

26:11.410 --> 26:14.740
Come on, Velma, we've got to
follow them down into the tomb.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.330
Maybe we can find a way
to reverse the curse.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.080
At least we've got Omar's journal.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.790
It could help guide us
safely through the chambers.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.000
Okay, gang, let's go in.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.090
Good idea.
And while you guys do that...

26:28.090 --> 26:30.920
...Scoob and I will stay here
and keep Prince Omar company.

26:31.470 --> 26:33.590
Hey, Scoob, how about
a round of Go Fish?

26:33.590 --> 26:35.930
- Yeah.
- No way, guys.

26:35.930 --> 26:37.770
There's no splitting up this time.

26:37.770 --> 26:42.440
Like Velma said, it's too dangerous.
We're better off if we stick together.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.610
Man, that's one steep drop,
Scooby-Doo.

26:49.070 --> 26:53.030
- I wonder how far down it goes.
- I don't know.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.710
Hey, like, where did everybody go?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.080
Wait for us.

27:06.130 --> 27:07.960
Nobody move.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.470
This is the first trap.

27:11.470 --> 27:15.470
- Jeepers, that doesn't look like Cleopatra.
- It's not.

27:15.800 --> 27:20.930
That's the Egyptian goddess Isis.
Her power protects Cleopatra's tomb.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.270
Like, gangway!

27:23.980 --> 27:25.440
Shaggy, Scooby, wait.

27:31.940 --> 27:35.450
Guys, don't move. The floor is a trap.

27:36.870 --> 27:40.790
Just our luck, Scoob. Out of the
frying pan and into the microwave.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.000
Move!

28:03.890 --> 28:05.480
Scoob, where are you?

28:10.190 --> 28:15.450
Well, how do you like that?
Instead of King Tut, I found King Mutt.

28:15.450 --> 28:17.820
King Mutt.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.120
Guys, are you okay?

28:21.450 --> 28:25.370
I think so, but we'd be better
if we had more sandwiches.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.040
They're okay.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.210
This way.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.010
Scooby, Shaggy, stay right there.

28:34.550 --> 28:38.340
- So much for not splitting up.
- Yeah.

28:50.940 --> 28:53.570
Hold on. We got something here.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.990
There's movement all around us.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.990
Look at all these creepy coffins.

29:01.410 --> 29:04.410
Hey, Scoob, do you know
who tucks a mummy into bed at night?

29:05.750 --> 29:07.410
His mummy.

29:11.420 --> 29:15.590
Hey, that might not be my best joke,
but you don't have to groan about it.

29:15.590 --> 29:17.970
- Shaggy.
- Not now, Scoob.

29:17.970 --> 29:21.090
Can't you see I'm working
on my junior Archeology merit badge?

29:29.020 --> 29:31.900
Like, run for it, Scoob!

29:34.020 --> 29:36.110
Listen. It's Shaggy and Scooby.

29:36.110 --> 29:37.610
They're in trouble.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.450
Guess what. So are we.

29:51.580 --> 29:53.380
The army of the undead.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.940
They're everywhere.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.230
Fall back.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.950
- Wow, she's good.
- Freddie, look out.

32:39.290 --> 32:43.300
Way to go, Scoob.
I think we lost them.

32:44.510 --> 32:49.090
Hey, is it just me,
or is this room getting taller?

32:51.100 --> 32:52.810
Look.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.810
Oh, no. Like, it's, like, quicksand.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.600
- Help!
- Help!

33:04.480 --> 33:07.030
This quicksand isn't quick enough.

33:08.990 --> 33:12.330
Down periscope, Scoob. Dive, dive.

33:38.270 --> 33:40.600
My glasses.

33:43.610 --> 33:46.820
I can't see a thing without my glasses.

33:47.860 --> 33:51.950
My glasses. Gee, thanks.

33:53.910 --> 33:55.740
Jinkies!

33:55.740 --> 33:57.700
It's Velma. Come on.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.340
Oh, no! Velma's been struck
by the curse.

34:05.340 --> 34:08.340
Okay, that's it.
This curse is going down.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.300
This time, it's personal.

34:10.300 --> 34:14.389
First Omar and now Velma.
Which one of us is next?

34:16.060 --> 34:18.560
We're not beat yet, Daphne.

34:19.429 --> 34:22.560
Here, you carry the necklace,
I'll take the journal.

34:22.940 --> 34:24.730
But what about Shaggy and Scooby?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.070
We're gonna find them
and solve this mystery.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.400
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

34:56.889 --> 34:59.520
Goodbye, cruel whirlpool.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.300
Hey, Scoob, you gotta see this.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.350
I think we're finally out of danger.

35:49.360 --> 35:54.110
- All hail the great Ascoobis.
- He has returned.

35:54.110 --> 36:00.790
Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis.

36:00.790 --> 36:04.290
Ascoobis. Ascoobis.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.420
Silence!

36:07.080 --> 36:10.800
What is the meaning of this outrage?

36:10.800 --> 36:15.680
Almighty Hotep,
the Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.430
Really? Where?

36:18.430 --> 36:21.180
I think they're talking about you,
Scooby-Doo.

36:21.180 --> 36:21.970
Me?

36:22.970 --> 36:25.520
It as the prophecy foretold.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.360
Our great Pharaoh Ascoobis
has returned to us.

36:29.360 --> 36:34.690
Along with Shaggankhamen,
his lanky manservant.

36:34.690 --> 36:38.200
Like, I hate to break it to you guys,
but we're not really...

36:38.200 --> 36:42.700
Enough! The prophecy has been fulfilled.

36:42.700 --> 36:46.830
We must prepare a great banquet.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.420
- Banquet?
- Banquet?

36:48.420 --> 36:54.300
That's right. Like, he's Ascoobis,
and just call me Shaggankhamen.

37:09.690 --> 37:12.480
Shaggy? Scooby?

37:12.480 --> 37:14.440
This place is awful.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.240
That's it, fear.
Show fear on your faces.

37:18.740 --> 37:20.990
Rock Rivers, is that you?

37:20.990 --> 37:24.580
Don't talk to the camera,
scream in terror.

37:24.580 --> 37:28.410
I knew it. You've been behind
this mystery all along.

37:28.410 --> 37:31.540
No way. I'm on the real this time.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.040
Come on, I'll show you.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.550
See, I couldn't fake this.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.800
It's the entire undead army.

37:43.800 --> 37:48.680
Gosh, this must be
their secret burial chamber.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.060
It's almost too grody, even for me.

37:53.060 --> 37:55.900
Jeepers, look at all of them.

37:55.900 --> 38:00.400
That's it. Now, take a close look
at their dried-up skin and freak out.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.200
Come on, show me the mummy.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.530
But it doesn't make sense.

38:05.530 --> 38:07.910
These mummies are still covered
in cobwebs.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.790
How could they have been chasing us?

38:09.790 --> 38:13.920
Yeah. They don't look like they've
moved since the day they were buried.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.420
Hey, check out this gnarly scroll.

38:18.420 --> 38:23.300
See the ancient text,
no doubt written in blood.

38:25.350 --> 38:28.140
Freddie, look, it's the ankh necklace.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.140
I'll translate the ancient writing.

38:30.810 --> 38:35.150
"Help, the heavy tourist
is pinching my kitten."

38:36.570 --> 38:40.490
How about "the necklace
is the key to the curse"?

38:40.490 --> 38:42.490
Even better.

38:42.490 --> 38:45.950
This is the key to the curse?
But what does that mean?

38:45.950 --> 38:49.290
It means the necklace is mine.

38:49.290 --> 38:51.790
Hand it over and nobody gets hurt.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.960
Back off. I know judo.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.550
Hey, I didn't say "ready."

39:02.930 --> 39:06.100
Hold it. We've got company.

39:11.680 --> 39:15.810
Who dares disturb my secret tomb?

39:25.360 --> 39:29.620
- Jeepers, the ghost of Cleopatra.
- Awesome.

39:29.620 --> 39:33.620
Behold she who commands you.

39:33.620 --> 39:37.290
Leave this place and never return.

39:37.290 --> 39:39.550
Cough up the crown and we'll go.

39:39.550 --> 39:44.800
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Cleopatra.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.550
Bring it, sister.

39:46.890 --> 39:50.890
Now suffer my swarming vengeance.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.650
Locusts.

39:58.650 --> 40:00.570
We have to get out of here!

40:09.740 --> 40:13.120
I don't understand. The curse
didn't say anything about locusts.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.660
No, but you got to admit,
it's pretty Egyptian.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.300
Freddie, come on.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.400
What about Velma and Omar?

40:38.400 --> 40:41.770
It's no use running around in the tombs.
We need to find some help.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.740
I just hope Scooby and Shaggy are okay.

40:46.990 --> 40:47.990
Ascoobis. Ascoobis.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.790
Ascoobis.

40:53.790 --> 40:56.460
All hail the prophecy.

40:56.460 --> 41:01.130
The great Pharaoh Ascoobis
has returned.

41:05.420 --> 41:09.470
Ascoobis. Ascoobis.

41:09.470 --> 41:12.470
Ascoobis.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.980
Just one question. Like,
where have you guys been all our lives?

41:17.520 --> 41:20.850
Welcome to the lost city
of the ancient ones.

41:20.850 --> 41:23.150
We have come here from many lands...

41:23.150 --> 41:27.990
...choosing to live according to the ways
of the Pharaohs of old.

41:27.990 --> 41:33.080
- That means no TV, no computers.
- And no fast food.

41:34.450 --> 41:38.410
So you guys are, like,
seriously old school.

41:38.410 --> 41:43.000
We prefer the magic and the mystery
of ancient Egypt...

41:43.000 --> 41:46.340
...to the ways of the modern world.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.510
You know what would be really magical?

41:50.510 --> 41:53.970
Some extra scoops of this
and another dozen of that.

41:56.100 --> 41:59.440
- With chocolate sauce.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.850
As Ascoobis wishes.

42:21.290 --> 42:26.000
If only Pharaoh Ascoobis knew
the rest of the prophecy.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.340
Isn't that right, my pet?

42:37.260 --> 42:38.970
This desert is huge.

42:38.970 --> 42:42.390
How are we ever going to find
Shaggy and Scooby?

42:42.390 --> 42:45.560
Well, maybe to find them,
we have to think like them.

42:45.560 --> 42:50.070
Okay, ask me questions,
and I'll answer as Shaggy and Scooby.

42:51.200 --> 42:55.240
Okay, Shaggy, if you made it out of
the Sphinx, where would you go?

42:55.240 --> 42:58.410
Like, man, anywhere there's food.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.910
That's pretty good. Now do Scooby.

43:01.910 --> 43:04.370
Where's the best place
to grab a bite to eat?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.420
That way.

43:16.220 --> 43:19.430
Wow, this bazaar is really bizarre.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.020
But I got a great deal on a new bag.

43:22.230 --> 43:25.560
Daphne, we're supposed to be
solving a mystery, not shopping.

43:25.560 --> 43:30.900
I bought it to keep the necklace safe.
Besides, it goes great with these shoes.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.530
Still no sign of Shaggy and Scooby.

43:33.530 --> 43:35.570
I thought for sure
we'd find them here.

43:35.570 --> 43:37.530
Daphne, look out!

43:40.910 --> 43:42.910
Hey, pal, what's the big idea?

43:42.910 --> 43:45.420
Freddie, run!

43:54.220 --> 43:58.300
I'm warning you, pal.
I'm a champion arm wrestler.

44:06.730 --> 44:10.650
That is the cheapest perfume I ever...

44:11.820 --> 44:13.440
Daphne!

44:35.340 --> 44:37.680
Oh, my head.

44:39.470 --> 44:43.060
Come on, Mom, it's Saturday.

44:44.770 --> 44:48.150
- Hi, Triple A.
- Where are we?

44:48.690 --> 44:53.530
We are atop
the Great Pyramid of Khufu.

44:53.530 --> 44:55.530
You will be safe here.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.360
Did I forget to mention
that I'm afraid of heights?

44:59.360 --> 45:01.990
We've got bigger problems
than heights, Freddie.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.450
Such as losing your friends.

45:05.080 --> 45:07.910
Shaggy and Scooby.
Do you know where they are?

45:07.910 --> 45:12.460
I have a friend who is, shall we say,
looking into it.

45:14.460 --> 45:15.840
Here he comes now.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.390
Scooby's collar.

45:22.390 --> 45:24.810
So they did make it out of the tomb.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.310
Excellent work, Horus.

45:27.310 --> 45:30.270
Now, tell me, where did you find this?

45:34.730 --> 45:38.400
We must travel north, by the stars.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.570
Nothing can stop me now.

45:42.570 --> 45:47.500
Soon Cleopatra's golden crown
will be mine.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.840
Oh, please, you'll get your cut.

45:57.840 --> 46:01.720
Now, get down there
and find what we came for.

46:22.660 --> 46:26.120
It's some kind of sports arena,
and the place is packed.

46:26.120 --> 46:29.410
Hey, do you think maybe
they played baseball in ancient Egypt?

46:29.410 --> 46:32.080
Oh, boy, I hope so.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.090
Loyal subjects of the lost city...

46:35.090 --> 46:40.470
...you have chosen to follow me
in the ways of ancient times.

46:40.470 --> 46:44.720
But now, as foretold in prophecy...

46:44.720 --> 46:49.560
...the Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned.

46:53.350 --> 46:56.400
Hey, Scoob, like,
here come the ancient peanut vendors.

47:01.820 --> 47:06.120
- Great seats, huh?
- We're number one. We're number one.

47:10.750 --> 47:13.500
I guess it must be
"shield and spear night."

47:13.500 --> 47:14.790
Yeah.

47:16.330 --> 47:22.340
And now, it is time for the great
Ascoobis to fulfill the prophecy...

47:22.340 --> 47:25.260
...by making a sacrifice of himself...

47:25.260 --> 47:31.100
...to the all-powerful spirit of the sand.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.270
What did he just say?

47:48.450 --> 47:52.040
Like, why do I get the feeling that
this isn't the home team's dugout?

49:03.440 --> 49:07.610
Like, maybe this sand spirit
is on a low-coward diet.

50:32.200 --> 50:37.950
No, citizens. Do not be alarmed
by what you see!

50:41.000 --> 50:42.210
Would you look at that.

50:42.210 --> 50:47.590
That sand spirit was really just a
remote-control monster run by Hotep.

50:48.090 --> 50:51.220
That man is not Hotep.

50:51.220 --> 50:54.220
Guys, you're okay.

50:54.220 --> 50:57.600
Not now, Freddie.
We're just wrapping up here.

50:57.600 --> 51:01.680
He is Amon Granger,
a brilliant civil engineer...

51:01.680 --> 51:05.440
...who has been illegally damming
the Nile River.

51:09.030 --> 51:10.400
Like, that's how we got here.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.070
He must have stolen the water from the
Nile to bring it into the city.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.660
And I would have
gotten away with it, too...

51:16.660 --> 51:21.080
...if it weren't for you
meddling, phony Pharaohs.

51:25.670 --> 51:28.090
So, like, was it just dumb luck
that Scoob and I...

51:28.090 --> 51:30.130
...happened to fit
the prophecy profile?

51:30.130 --> 51:32.920
There is no such thing as dumb luck,
my friend.

51:32.920 --> 51:37.850
I believe fate brought you here
for a special purpose.

51:38.050 --> 51:39.560
Really?

51:39.560 --> 51:43.480
Like, maybe it was to solve a mystery
all by ourselves.

51:43.480 --> 51:45.440
Won't Velma be proud.

51:45.770 --> 51:47.690
Yeah.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.270
Velma?

51:50.270 --> 51:52.360
Hey, like, where is she?

52:02.790 --> 52:04.290
It just doesn't add up.

52:04.290 --> 52:07.460
If the Nile ran dry
because of Hotep's scheme...

52:07.460 --> 52:10.290
...could the curse of Cleopatra
be a hoax after all?

52:10.290 --> 52:13.800
Hoax? Like, tell that to poor Velma,
turned to stone...

52:13.800 --> 52:16.130
...and meanwhile,
we're living the good life.

52:16.130 --> 52:18.800
Well, except for that
giant-scorpion part.

52:22.310 --> 52:26.640
Poor Scooby.
Listen to him, he's heartbroken.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.650
I've got something
that might cheer you up.

52:31.650 --> 52:34.190
Recognize this?

52:36.740 --> 52:38.950
Scooby-Doo.

52:44.120 --> 52:48.460
The ankh necklace.
It was in my new bag. Where is it?

52:48.460 --> 52:50.960
I'm afraid the thieves
who attacked you...

52:50.960 --> 52:53.460
...did not go away empty-handed.

52:53.460 --> 52:56.130
Then they must have known
what they were stealing.

52:57.170 --> 53:01.550
Amelia von Butch. She knew
the necklace was the key to the curse.

53:01.550 --> 53:03.260
If Amelia has the necklace...

53:03.260 --> 53:07.180
...we might never be able
to turn Velma and Omar back.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.150
They'll be cold stone forever.

53:11.150 --> 53:16.030
Hang on, Shag.
I think I feel a plan coming on.

53:18.490 --> 53:22.030
Okay, gang, we're all set.
Daphne, you know what to do.

53:22.030 --> 53:24.290
Scooby and Shaggy,
you two follow me.

53:24.290 --> 53:27.120
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

53:28.660 --> 53:31.540
Scooby, wait! I said, follow me.

53:31.540 --> 53:35.710
Don't worry, Fred. I'll be hiding
right behind you the whole time.

54:00.990 --> 54:02.490
It's Rock Rivers.

54:02.490 --> 54:05.240
The curse has claimed another victim.

54:05.240 --> 54:09.750
Rock Rivers is solid rock.

54:18.550 --> 54:22.430
Listen, guys. It must be
the undead army. They're close by.

54:22.430 --> 54:27.680
Not again. Like, for once in my life,
I don't want my mummy.

54:50.750 --> 54:53.290
Keep out of sight.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.470
Let me go.

55:02.470 --> 55:05.590
They've got Dr. Von Butch
and her gruesome twosome.

55:08.060 --> 55:10.270
And she's wearing the ankh necklace.

55:10.270 --> 55:13.060
Okay, guys, it's time for phase two.

55:15.650 --> 55:18.270
Tell us again about phase two.

55:30.290 --> 55:33.500
Hey, man. Like, we're here for the big
Cleopatra party.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.170
Yeah, Cleopatra.

55:46.930 --> 55:48.180
Thanks, man.

56:11.910 --> 56:16.420
Well, so much for
Monsterpiece Theatre.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.520
That was a close one.

56:39.520 --> 56:43.230
Like, what's up with the
soggy seating arrangements?

56:45.190 --> 56:50.120
Hey! These are bags of cement.
I wonder what they're doing down here.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.830
Holy cow, Scoob, we made it.

56:59.830 --> 57:04.130
Now all we've gotta do is sit tight
and wait for Fred to give us the signal.

57:04.340 --> 57:05.960
Shaggy, look.

57:24.860 --> 57:29.320
Who dares disturb the tomb
of the great Cleopatra?

57:29.320 --> 57:32.700
In the name of Isis,
goddess of Egypt...

57:32.700 --> 57:37.200
...be merciful to us,
O queen of the Nile.

57:38.410 --> 57:41.170
- Yeah.
- What she said.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.530
Your greed has brought you far
and through many dangers...

58:11.530 --> 58:13.990
...to look upon my golden beauty.

58:13.990 --> 58:17.700
Now you shall receive
what you came for.

58:22.420 --> 58:23.210
No!

58:24.670 --> 58:26.920
It can't end like this for me.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.670
If you let me go, I promise...

58:29.670 --> 58:32.840
...I'll stop treasure-hunting forever.
I'll open an orphanage.

58:32.840 --> 58:37.260
I'll save the rain forest. I'll recycle.

58:38.270 --> 58:42.100
It is too late for that now.

58:45.190 --> 58:48.900
Oh, it's too horrible, Scoob.
I can't bear to watch it anymore.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.360
Me neither.

58:55.870 --> 58:57.700
Freddie.

59:04.210 --> 59:06.500
Like, either Fred's taken up
ancient aerobics...

59:06.500 --> 59:09.340
...or that's the signal. Hit it, Scoob.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.470
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

59:19.680 --> 59:23.100
And, like, Shaggy too!

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.620
Behold, I am the great and powerful
Cleopatra.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.040
All shall bow down before me.

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.870
Two Cleopatras?

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.470
Charge!

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.290
Daphne.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.460
They've got Daphne. Come on, Scoob.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.800
Oh, you poor girl. Two thousand years
hasn't done a thing for your complexion.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.970
Here, try a little blush.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.810
We'll take it from here,
other Cleopatra.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.340
Look out, we're on a roll.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:05.600
Holy smokes, a flying carpet.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:13.520
Way to go, Scoob. Like, charge!

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:45.010
Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.830
"Here lies Cleopatra,
last of the Pharaohs...

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:15.540
...protector of the lost riches
of ancient Egypt."

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:28.930
A third Cleopatra.
Let's hope three's a charm.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.920
Amelia von Butch,
you are unstoppable.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:15.060
At last,
the crown of Cleopatra is mine.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.190
Jeepers.

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:28.820
Leave this chamber
or be doomed forever!

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.620
No!

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:01.310
Hold on, gang.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.170
Keep paddling, Scoob,
she's right behind us.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.770
Bear witness, mighty Sphinx.

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:41.520
The crown is mine.

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:47.610
No! My crown!

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.920
I wonder, do Fred's plans
always work so well?

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:12.050
Let me down! I command you.
The crown is rightfully mine.

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:17.310
I am the sole survivor
of Cleopatra's curse.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.310
You speak too quickly.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.150
The desert still holds many secrets.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.520
It's Cleopatra. Look out.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.150
I don't know, Daph,
she looks pretty washed-up to me.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.450
Velma?

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.750
Okay, Scooby, okay.

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:23.500
Velma!

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.050
We did it, Velma, we did it.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:33.630
Prince Omar. He's okay.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.810
The golden crown of Cleopatra.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:46.560
It is in good hands now,
my young prince.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.400
That was great.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.610
But could we do it again?
I'd like to get it from another angle.

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.860
It's Rock Rivers. He's okay too.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:59.330
Now, hold on.
Is there really a curse or, like, not?

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:03.910
I'm sure it's very easy to explain.
Let's see.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.460
Okay, maybe it isn't.

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.880
As soon as we discovered
the hidden chamber...

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.920
...Omar knew that treasure hunters
would come from all over.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.050
I hoped that if we could bring the curse
to life, it would scare away the looters.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.100
So Velma became Cleopatra...

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:25.229
...while my workers and I
became her army of the undead.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:30.060
Then you used the quick-drying cement
to make stone statues of yourselves.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.939
Convincing us all that
the curse had really come true.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:39.450
I did add a few extra touches
of my own, like the swarm of locusts.

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:42.330
I learned to breed them
last year in science class.

01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:45.120
Who knew it would come in so handy?

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.790
You guys put on an awesome scare.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.960
Maybe we could do a project together.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.090
We already have, Rock.
After you offered to play along...

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.970
...we took your video camera
and cataloged most of the tomb.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.760
Thanks to you, that footage is going
to be seen around the world.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.470
Yeah, baby. I'm going global.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.770
The only thing we didn't count on
was your surprise visit to the work site.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.270
But we could have helped you.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.689
Yeah. Why didn't you
let us in on the secret?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:17.490
Like I said, I knew it would be dangerous,
and I didn't want any of you to get hurt.

01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:21.120
I never imagined that you would lead
an army of your own back to the tomb...

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.490
...just to rescue me.

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:27.500
Well, we have the citizens of
the lost city to thank for that.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.000
But it was really Shaggy and Scooby
who were the bravest of all.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.170
They insisted on coming back for you,
no matter what.

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:39.630
Oh, you guys are the best friends ever.

01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:43.680
And now Cleopatra's final wish
has been granted.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.060
The riches of Egypt
have been returned to her people.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.729
I won't stand for this.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:56.690
Give me my crown.
My crown. I want my crown.

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:06.700
Well, that ought to hold it
for another few thousand years.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.830
You should be proud, Velma.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:12.920
You helped restore one of
the great monuments of the world.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:15.500
I just had a small part in the work.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.920
But you play a very large part
in all of our lives.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.050
Yeah.

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:23.720
Scooby.

01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:27.970
Like, check it out, gang.
A firework fit for the Pharaohs.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.810
Are you sure
that's a good idea, Shaggy?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:34.150
Sure. What could go wrong?

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.090
You know, I think
it looks better that way.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.600
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
