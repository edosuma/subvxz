WEBVTT

00:11.410 --> 00:16.213
There's so much
murderous intent here.

00:16.215 --> 00:18.616
I had a very violent encounter
with a male entity.

00:19.885 --> 00:22.420
He's attached
to somebody here.

00:23.689 --> 00:26.623
I think it's eventually
gonna kill us.

00:27.693 --> 00:31.895
I think murderers would
be, like, bred here.

00:31.897 --> 00:35.098
He confessed to as
many as 49 murders.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.502
He could have been
a serial killer.

00:38.504 --> 00:41.705
Yeah.

00:41.707 --> 00:46.243
This house could cause
somebody to kill somebody.

00:46.245 --> 00:49.180
And I just feel fear.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.848
My name is Amy Allan.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.984
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:53.986 --> 00:55.185
I see dead people.

00:55.187 --> 00:57.454
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:57.456 --> 00:59.389
I speak to dead people.

00:59.391 --> 01:02.326
She hates them, hates them.

01:02.328 --> 01:04.729
And they speak to me.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.265
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:08.267 --> 01:11.668
It's a demon.
It's Satan.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.270
I rely on my partner.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.671
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:14.673 --> 01:16.607
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.475
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:18.477 --> 01:22.146
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.547
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:23.549 --> 01:25.015
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:25.017 --> 01:26.550
It's my job to reveal them.

01:26.552 --> 01:29.019
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:29.021 --> 01:31.021
But Steve and I never speak...

01:31.023 --> 01:33.090
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.291
...until the very end...

01:34.293 --> 01:36.360
I don't even want
to show you this.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.562
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:38.564 --> 01:40.564
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:40.566 --> 01:42.500
...or time to get out.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.034
You have to get out.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

01:56.382 --> 01:58.982
I'm out here
in Colorado Springs.

01:58.984 --> 02:00.317
It's about an hour
south of Denver.

02:00.319 --> 02:02.253
I got a call from
a woman named Jordan.

02:02.255 --> 02:05.522
Now, she says she made
a terrible mistake.

02:05.524 --> 02:08.258
She started a paranormal
group with her wife,

02:08.259 --> 02:11.395
and now all hell has
broken loose in her house.

02:11.397 --> 02:12.863
She's in way over her head,

02:12.865 --> 02:14.999
and says if Amy
and I can't fix it,

02:15.001 --> 02:18.536
somebody's gonna wind up dead.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.803
Before Amy arrives,

02:19.805 --> 02:22.940
I look for any
leading information.

02:22.942 --> 02:26.943
Besides typical things like
photographs and medication,

02:26.945 --> 02:28.612
this home has
other unusual items

02:28.614 --> 02:31.815
that I need to remove or cover.

02:31.817 --> 02:34.685
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.099
Interesting.

02:49.101 --> 02:51.502
I feel lost,

02:51.504 --> 02:55.239
stressed out and lost,
and angry.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.909
Then this overwhelming
sense of emptiness,

02:58.911 --> 03:01.045
and it's just really consuming.

03:01.047 --> 03:05.149
It's, like...horrible.

03:08.053 --> 03:11.188
This house could cause
somebody to kill somebody.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.600
Jordan, when we
spoke on the phone,

03:23.602 --> 03:25.436
it sounded like things
were pretty bad here.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.737
What's it like
living here?

03:26.739 --> 03:29.573
The paranormal activity
here is destroying us.

03:29.575 --> 03:31.942
The depression in this
house is overwhelming.

03:31.944 --> 03:34.612
The anger is overwhelming.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.212
So who all lives
in the house?

03:36.214 --> 03:38.882
Well, there's my
wife, Lorie, and I.

03:38.884 --> 03:40.417
Okay.

03:40.419 --> 03:43.887
What kind of experiences
is everybody having?

03:43.889 --> 03:45.823
It started with footsteps,

03:45.825 --> 03:49.493
voices, shadow figures,

03:49.495 --> 03:52.162
objects being moved.

03:52.164 --> 03:54.031
Went to health issues.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.166
What health issues
are you having?

03:56.168 --> 03:58.702
I started having
serious stomach issues.

03:58.704 --> 04:02.505
They did the scopes, they
did the things that they do.

04:02.507 --> 04:03.774
Nothing.

04:03.776 --> 04:04.975
All right, as far
as health goes,

04:04.977 --> 04:06.176
I'm not sure if that's
paranormal or not.

04:06.178 --> 04:07.911
That's something
we'll ask Amy.

04:07.913 --> 04:09.513
So, Jordan, you
mentioned on the phone

04:09.515 --> 04:11.715
that you have
a paranormal group.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.384
What exactly
do you guys do?

04:13.386 --> 04:16.119
People call us for help.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.387
We've never had an issue,
never had a problem,

04:17.389 --> 04:18.789
until two years ago

04:18.791 --> 04:20.923
when we did an investigation
in Denver at a hotel.

04:20.926 --> 04:22.326
So what went wrong?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.928
I had a very violent
encounter with a male entity.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.731
Ever since then, everything in
the house has gone to hell.

04:27.733 --> 04:30.267
So you think you brought
something home from here?

04:30.269 --> 04:32.469
I do, yes.

04:32.471 --> 04:34.604
So besides this entity,

04:34.606 --> 04:37.007
that you think you took,
or a person, from Denver,

04:37.009 --> 04:38.409
what else
do you think is here?

04:38.411 --> 04:41.612
Could be
Lorie's ex, Nora.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.814
Why would Nora be here?
Did she die here?

04:43.816 --> 04:45.749
No, but she was
very, very ill here

04:45.751 --> 04:47.284
for a very long time,

04:47.286 --> 04:49.353
and this was her home,
the only home that she knew.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.421
What was wrong with Nora,
what did she pass from?

04:51.423 --> 04:53.757
She had severe,
severe epilepsy.

04:53.759 --> 04:56.694
And it had caused
such brain problems,

04:56.696 --> 04:59.563
it turned into
a terminal brain issue.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.698
You're in a tough
spot, obviously.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.633
What are you hoping
we can do?

05:03.635 --> 05:06.370
Just get our life back,
our house back.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.304
I'm supposed to be the one
that protects my family

05:08.306 --> 05:10.307
and my home, and I can't.

05:10.309 --> 05:12.109
Nothing has
ever hurt me more

05:12.111 --> 05:14.978
because I feel
it's my fault.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.047
It's got to stop.

05:17.049 --> 05:18.716
It's got to stop.

05:23.856 --> 05:27.124
I'm getting this little lady.

05:27.126 --> 05:32.262
She's really tiny,
probably in her 60s.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.005
She's freaking out about
another dead lady that's here.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.407
She says, "It's horrible,
it's horrible.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.009
Help me, help me, help me.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.544
She's abusing me,
she's abusing me."

05:50.482 --> 05:53.817
She's like, "My head
hurts, my head hurts."

05:53.819 --> 05:56.019
Maybe she had a stroke

05:56.021 --> 06:00.357
or she had Alzheimer's
or dementia.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.826
There's something going
on with her brain.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.629
Is this something that
could affect the living?

06:05.631 --> 06:09.232
I think the living would
experience headaches here,

06:09.234 --> 06:12.636
definitely, like, migraines.

06:12.638 --> 06:16.573
I think that the living might
hear her crying and yelling.

06:20.446 --> 06:23.580
The really bad thing
is this head issue,

06:23.582 --> 06:25.982
like, it's really painful.

06:25.984 --> 06:30.254
And also, her
depression and despair.

06:30.256 --> 06:34.657
Like it's really, really sad.

06:34.659 --> 06:36.927
This is not a good situation.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.600
Okay, Jordan,
so what's going on in here?

06:43.602 --> 06:45.402
We have a problem
with the staircase

06:45.404 --> 06:46.936
that's right back here.

06:46.938 --> 06:48.405
It feels like
someone's on your butt,

06:48.407 --> 06:50.140
they're chasing you
up the stairs.

06:50.142 --> 06:52.609
Do you feel anything
or is it just a sense?

06:52.611 --> 06:54.744
You feel the pressure.

06:54.746 --> 06:56.279
Could it be
anything like maybe

06:56.281 --> 06:57.480
the dogs are running up
on you, anything like that?

06:57.482 --> 06:59.416
No, the dogs don't
go downstairs.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.684
All right,
so anything else?

07:00.686 --> 07:02.019
Yeah,
the shadow figures.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.820
Sometimes I'll come
out of the kitchen,

07:03.822 --> 07:06.723
and we'll run
into each other.

07:06.725 --> 07:08.091
Jordan, you're sure
you're not seeing a shadow

07:08.093 --> 07:09.292
from somebody else that
lives in the house?

07:09.294 --> 07:10.560
Absolutely.

07:10.562 --> 07:12.295
All right, so what do
you think this thing is?

07:12.297 --> 07:15.298
I think it's the guy from
the investigation in Denver.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.767
Okay.

07:21.707 --> 07:24.708
There's a creepy dead guy here.

07:24.710 --> 07:29.179
He is a war vet,
and he is military.

07:29.181 --> 07:32.449
He's covered in mud,

07:32.451 --> 07:37.254
and on his chest,
he wrote "Killer."

07:37.256 --> 07:40.724
He is angry and lost,
and he's lashing out.

07:44.462 --> 07:46.463
He's attached
to somebody here.

07:49.067 --> 07:53.536
What he's doing to
people is wrong.

07:53.538 --> 07:58.808
The living would see
an elongated, like, shadow.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.411
He crawls up and down
the stairs.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.485
So that makes me worried

08:08.487 --> 08:12.822
about him causing, you know,
people to fall and stuff.

08:18.964 --> 08:21.231
So, Jordan, I assume this is
where you and Lorie sleep?

08:21.233 --> 08:22.499
Used to be.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.234
But her health
has gotten so bad

08:24.236 --> 08:26.436
that she can no longer
come down here to sleep,

08:26.438 --> 08:27.637
so it's just me.

08:27.639 --> 08:28.972
So she's
out on the couch?

08:28.974 --> 08:30.440
She's out on the couch.

08:30.442 --> 08:31.642
Okay,
so what's going on?

08:31.644 --> 08:34.578
In here, there's huge
banging, knocking.

08:34.580 --> 08:39.448
It's just very loud,
sudden bangs.

08:39.451 --> 08:41.518
I mean, I see big trees
all around the house.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.187
Is it possible that something
from the tree is falling,

08:44.188 --> 08:47.457
or from wind, a branch
banging against the house?

08:47.459 --> 08:49.660
No, we have them cut
every year.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.461
Is it possible
the plumbing is banging?

08:51.463 --> 08:53.163
No,
it's not that at all.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.732
And we've looked.
I would love it to be that.

08:55.734 --> 08:57.534
Okay, what else?

08:57.536 --> 08:59.135
I've been pulled
out of bed.

08:59.137 --> 09:01.471
I was laying here
asleep,

09:01.473 --> 09:03.540
and he yanked me
so hard,

09:03.542 --> 09:05.142
I felt like my shoulder

09:05.144 --> 09:06.809
was just gonna come
right out of its socket,

09:06.811 --> 09:09.279
and landed halfway
on the floor.

09:09.281 --> 09:11.148
Were you in a dead sleep?
Yes.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.282
You suffer from seizures,
or anything like that?

09:12.284 --> 09:13.883
No.

09:13.885 --> 09:15.151
So has anything else physically
like that happened to you?

09:15.153 --> 09:16.620
Yeah, there's been
a couple of bad ones.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.821
Like what?

09:17.823 --> 09:21.090
I have actually been
walking out the door.

09:21.092 --> 09:22.292
Okay.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.894
And been pushed
against the wall,

09:23.896 --> 09:25.562
almost like I was
being arrested.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.698
You said a couple of
physical things happened.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.965
What's the other?

09:28.967 --> 09:31.034
I was getting up to go
and do something,

09:31.036 --> 09:34.437
and literally was punched

09:34.439 --> 09:35.972
in the middle of
the back so hard

09:35.974 --> 09:38.442
that it knocked me
to my knees.

09:38.444 --> 09:42.846
And it was so bad that
I ended up in the E.R.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.181
And how are you
dealing with all this?

09:44.183 --> 09:45.515
It's incredibly stressful.

09:45.517 --> 09:49.118
And it causes major mood
swings for me, as well.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.320
I turn into someone
I don't know.

09:50.322 --> 09:52.055
I turn into someone
that scares me.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.725
I don't know what I'm
capable of at that moment.

09:59.198 --> 10:02.599
This military guy,
he's very, very scared.

10:04.203 --> 10:08.204
I think that living people
would feel his fear.

10:08.206 --> 10:12.409
Sometimes where he's like
freakin' the **** out,

10:12.411 --> 10:16.113
yelling,
like, hitting things...

10:18.083 --> 10:19.382
...punching the wall,

10:19.384 --> 10:21.551
like, he's losing his mind,
you know?

10:23.889 --> 10:26.823
So I think the living would
hear that and feel it,

10:26.825 --> 10:29.026
because he's, like...

10:29.028 --> 10:33.229
And he's physical,
you know, he's punching, like...

10:33.231 --> 10:35.832
That man comes back here a lot.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.568
He can do harm, he's a threat.

10:38.570 --> 10:39.970
And it's not good.

11:10.702 --> 11:12.168
So, Lorie, I was
talking to your wife,

11:12.170 --> 11:13.970
and she feels that
whatever's in this house

11:13.972 --> 11:15.171
is pretty dangerous.

11:15.173 --> 11:16.639
Do you agree with her?

11:16.641 --> 11:18.241
Definitely.

11:18.243 --> 11:19.642
So I know you guys are
having experiences.

11:19.644 --> 11:21.044
I want to hear
about yours.

11:21.046 --> 11:22.712
When I'm sitting here,
I can hear things

11:22.714 --> 11:24.247
in the kitchen
moving around.

11:24.249 --> 11:26.449
Okay, so do me a favor and
describe what you're hearing.

11:26.451 --> 11:28.317
It sounds like
someone's cooking.

11:28.319 --> 11:31.654
The pans are banging,
the cupboards are going.

11:31.656 --> 11:34.257
You hear, like,
the utensil drawer opening.

11:34.259 --> 11:37.460
It's loud.

11:37.462 --> 11:38.595
Anything else?

11:39.797 --> 11:41.564
One of the main things
is the dark figure

11:41.566 --> 11:43.333
that I see
in the hallway.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.668
Describe what that
figure looks like to you.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.536
He's darker than the dark.

11:47.538 --> 11:50.673
He's so tall,
broad shoulders.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.276
To me, he's looking at me,
like, taunting me.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.945
So you've got stuff rattling
around in the kitchen,

11:55.947 --> 11:57.213
like somebody's cooking,

11:57.215 --> 11:58.882
you've got a dark figure
in the hallway there.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.882
Right.

11:59.884 --> 12:01.151
Anything else?

12:01.153 --> 12:03.019
There was one night
that I was laying here,

12:03.021 --> 12:04.754
and just
before I fell asleep,

12:04.756 --> 12:07.357
I heard a woman
crying in my ear.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.225
Right in my ear.

12:09.227 --> 12:12.562
Like sobbing, cried
to me, "Help me."

12:12.564 --> 12:13.963
Could it have been
somebody outside the door?

12:13.965 --> 12:16.032
I thought that,
too, and nothing.

12:16.034 --> 12:17.467
There was
no one out there.

12:17.469 --> 12:19.436
Okay, that's strange.

12:19.438 --> 12:20.637
Yeah.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.308
I'm seeing the other dead lady,

12:25.310 --> 12:28.311
the one the little lady
was freaking out about.

12:28.313 --> 12:31.448
Her main area is the kitchen.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.984
She's physical, she's
aggressive, she's in your face,

12:34.986 --> 12:37.253
she's so stressed out.

12:40.859 --> 12:44.794
Anybody experiencing, like,
extreme stress here, that's her.

12:44.796 --> 12:49.665
This is a consistent anger
that's permeated this place

12:49.667 --> 12:51.066
because of her.

12:51.068 --> 12:55.138
The living here would
suddenly, spontaneously get mad.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.406
Like if somebody moved in here

12:56.408 --> 12:58.274
and they didn't
used to be angry,

12:58.276 --> 13:00.943
but they move here and
they're always angry.

13:00.945 --> 13:02.278
And why?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.080
Well, she wants them to leave.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.486
That's been her M.O.
is to get them out.

13:10.488 --> 13:13.222
She apparently had
some type of protocol

13:13.224 --> 13:14.723
that has worked in the past,

13:14.725 --> 13:17.093
as far as, like,
getting people out.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.162
Well, it's not
working this time.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.030
So you're saying
she's gotten the living

13:21.032 --> 13:22.431
to leave
this place before?

13:22.433 --> 13:24.701
That's what she's
indicating, yeah.

13:26.638 --> 13:28.504
Jordan mentioned to me
about some of the attacks

13:28.506 --> 13:29.638
that's happened to her.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.241
Have you had anything
similar to that?

13:31.243 --> 13:33.642
I have woken up and I
have, like, fingerprints.

13:33.644 --> 13:37.046
They're, like, three
gouges right here.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.915
You ever
have violent dreams

13:39.917 --> 13:41.584
where you maybe grab yourself
or anything like that?

13:41.586 --> 13:42.452
No.

13:42.454 --> 13:43.853
Nothing like that?
No.

13:43.855 --> 13:45.054
Anything else?

13:45.056 --> 13:47.256
There was this one time
that I was sitting here,

13:47.258 --> 13:50.192
and I saw a woman standing
at the end of the hallway.

13:50.194 --> 13:52.595
She was probably, like,
80, 90 years old.

13:52.597 --> 13:54.063
We had locked eyes,

13:54.065 --> 13:56.132
and her face
kind of transformed

13:56.134 --> 13:57.933
into,
like, almost a monster,

13:57.935 --> 13:59.535
like a demon
sort of thing.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.672
Okay.
Scared me to death.

14:02.674 --> 14:05.007
If you saw a picture of her,
would you recognize her?

14:05.009 --> 14:06.475
Yes.

14:06.477 --> 14:09.011
So, all that's going on,
how are you dealing with it?

14:09.013 --> 14:11.080
Not very well.

14:11.082 --> 14:15.018
I mean, every night,
I sob, I cry.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.552
I can't fix it.

14:16.554 --> 14:18.821
It got so bad, that's
when I turned to Jordan,

14:18.823 --> 14:20.490
I said,
"We need the big guns."
Right.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.892
I said, "I got to call
in Amy and Steve."

14:22.894 --> 14:24.961
I didn't know
what else to do.

14:24.963 --> 14:27.230
What do you think
whatever's here wants?

14:27.232 --> 14:29.632
They want to hurt us

14:29.634 --> 14:31.901
as much
as they possibly can.

14:31.903 --> 14:34.570
I think it's eventually
gonna kill us,

14:34.572 --> 14:36.973
that it's gonna
wear us down so far,

14:36.975 --> 14:38.508
that we're gonna
be dead.

14:43.180 --> 14:46.449
This other dead woman,
she's bad.

14:46.451 --> 14:50.987
She is dogging one of the
living people here, hard-core.

14:50.989 --> 14:53.389
I want to say it's a female.

14:53.391 --> 14:58.061
Basically, she is kind of
tormenting this person,

14:58.063 --> 14:59.995
not letting them sleep.

14:59.997 --> 15:01.530
It's just when they're
getting comfortable

15:01.532 --> 15:04.934
and that's when she likes to
**** with this person.

15:04.936 --> 15:07.136
That's when they've seen her,

15:07.138 --> 15:11.607
like, this weird, morphed face.

15:11.609 --> 15:16.546
Her fingers turning into
little black snakes.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.948
This person now, like,
really can't sleep,

15:18.950 --> 15:20.950
so, like, they're insomniacs,

15:20.952 --> 15:23.486
and it's wearing them down,
which is making them sick.

15:23.488 --> 15:25.421
She likes to make them vomit.

15:25.423 --> 15:28.424
She likes to make
them feel pain.

15:28.426 --> 15:30.893
She could physically harm them.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.495
Do you have
any idea why?

15:32.497 --> 15:34.831
She wants her house back.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.766
And she's had it.

15:36.768 --> 15:40.503
Basically, like, whatever she
has to do, she's gonna do it.

15:40.505 --> 15:41.905
I'm just shocked
she hasn't killed

15:41.907 --> 15:43.573
this person yet, honestly,

15:43.575 --> 15:45.975
because I think she
could, I really do.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.498
So before I got to town,

16:09.500 --> 16:11.633
I called a bunch of locals
and had them start looking into

16:11.635 --> 16:14.102
Jordan and Lorie's
property for me.

16:14.104 --> 16:15.637
Well, an historian
just called back,

16:15.639 --> 16:16.972
and she says she's got something

16:16.974 --> 16:19.374
I'm definitely gonna
want to know about.

16:19.376 --> 16:21.710
It turns out one of the
original owners of the land

16:21.712 --> 16:24.913
got a deadly illness as
soon as he bought the place.

16:30.855 --> 16:32.253
Katie,
you mentioned on the phone

16:32.255 --> 16:34.256
that one of the original
owners of my clients' property

16:34.258 --> 16:35.991
got sick the minute
he got here.

16:35.993 --> 16:37.926
Before
we even get to that,

16:37.928 --> 16:39.461
what do you know
about this guy?

16:39.463 --> 16:42.197
Yeah, so Frederick Rowe
was his name.

16:42.199 --> 16:43.865
He was
an insurance salesman

16:43.867 --> 16:47.002
and a real-estate agent
here in Colorado Springs,

16:47.004 --> 16:50.472
and he purchased
your client's property

16:50.474 --> 16:52.741
in March of 1889.

16:52.743 --> 16:53.875
Does he come alone?

16:53.877 --> 16:55.076
Is he single, a family,
what's the story?

16:55.078 --> 16:56.478
He brought along
his family.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.548
He had a wife named
Clarabelle and two daughters.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.816
All right, so I know he
gets sick pretty quick.

17:00.818 --> 17:01.950
What happened?

17:01.952 --> 17:05.153
Rowe ended up
contracting tuberculosis

17:05.155 --> 17:09.156
a few months after purchasing
your clients' property.

17:09.159 --> 17:12.094
This is a miserable disease
from what I've learned.

17:12.096 --> 17:13.561
How long did he
suffer with it?

17:13.564 --> 17:16.431
He suffered for the
better part of a year,

17:16.433 --> 17:19.701
chills, fever,
weight loss,

17:19.703 --> 17:22.905
coughing up blood, just
really pretty torturous.

17:22.906 --> 17:25.973
So he ends up dying
July 18, 1890.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.242
Okay.

17:27.243 --> 17:30.112
I've got a copy here
of the death register.

17:30.114 --> 17:32.180
Now, how old was this
guy when he died?

17:32.182 --> 17:33.915
He was 57.

17:39.790 --> 17:42.390
I'm feeling death down here.

17:46.063 --> 17:48.263
I think it's a male.

17:48.265 --> 17:52.534
This person right here
is -- is...

17:52.536 --> 17:55.070
definitely, like, right
there in their death state,

17:55.072 --> 17:59.074
like right when they're
right about to die.

17:59.076 --> 18:01.210
They're still
breathing a little bit,

18:01.212 --> 18:04.213
and they're feeling the cold
creeping through their body.

18:04.215 --> 18:07.750
There's something
really wrong with it.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.086
Okay, so I know that
at that time period,

18:11.088 --> 18:14.289
TB was pretty rampant
all over the country.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.825
Now, how bad did it get
here in Colorado Springs?

18:16.827 --> 18:19.494
It was pretty bad here
with the dry climate.

18:19.496 --> 18:22.698
You had a lot of people
moving here with TB.

18:22.700 --> 18:26.501
TB sanatoriums pop up
around the city.

18:26.503 --> 18:30.806
One was behind me here --
Cragmor Sanatorium.

18:32.042 --> 18:34.309
Any idea how many
people died from TB

18:34.311 --> 18:35.911
in Colorado Springs
during that time period?

18:35.913 --> 18:39.781
There wasn't a vaccine
for TB until 1921,

18:39.783 --> 18:42.117
so you had
thousands of people

18:42.119 --> 18:44.186
dying here
in Colorado Springs.

18:47.057 --> 18:50.125
A lot of pain here and illness.

18:52.596 --> 18:55.330
It's the blood,
they're hearing blood.

18:55.332 --> 18:57.065
Like,
they're trying to fight it,

18:57.067 --> 18:59.668
but it's really loud.

18:59.670 --> 19:03.104
They're hearing the pulsing,
they're hearing the blood.

19:03.106 --> 19:05.206
It's hard to explain
what you're hearing.

19:05.208 --> 19:09.278
Around you is a lot of noise,

19:09.280 --> 19:12.280
voices, all these
things are going on.

19:12.282 --> 19:15.216
It's like this weird
echo-y, like they're dying.

19:15.218 --> 19:16.752
They're hearing it
and feeling it.

19:16.754 --> 19:18.086
It's loud.

19:18.088 --> 19:20.622
They're hearing that loudness.

19:20.624 --> 19:22.824
I don't understand
what happened to them.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.364
If you were exposed
for a long time,

19:29.366 --> 19:30.965
you'd feel not good.

19:30.967 --> 19:34.168
You'd feel very sick,
very drained.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.871
Sick.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.242
So far,
I have a couple convinced

19:40.244 --> 19:41.710
they brought something
dangerous home

19:41.712 --> 19:43.845
from a paranormal investigation

19:43.847 --> 19:45.914
on a property where
one of the previous owners

19:45.916 --> 19:47.916
died of tuberculosis,

19:47.918 --> 19:51.119
but I want to see if
there's anything else.

19:51.121 --> 19:52.654
Searching through old records,

19:52.656 --> 19:55.924
I find an elderly woman who
was murdered in the mid 1990s,

19:55.926 --> 20:00.395
right across the street from
Jordan and Lorie's property.

20:00.397 --> 20:02.864
You know, you've got to
be one sick rat bastard

20:02.866 --> 20:05.066
to murder a 96-year-old woman.

20:05.068 --> 20:07.669
I'm headed over to meet
the city's medical examiner,

20:07.671 --> 20:10.538
who says there was never
any justice in this case.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.212
Dr. Kelly,
I appreciate

20:18.214 --> 20:19.280
you helping me out
with this.

20:19.282 --> 20:20.749
So the article
I found and researched

20:20.751 --> 20:22.751
was a 96-year-old
woman who was murdered.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.218
What do we know
about the victim?

20:24.220 --> 20:26.955
So, Marjorie Mock
was found dead

20:26.957 --> 20:30.759
right across the street
from your clients' home.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.894
What do you know
about her?

20:32.896 --> 20:34.963
She was kind of locally
famous, actually.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.097
She did not
leave the house

20:36.099 --> 20:37.566
unless she was
dressed to the nines,

20:37.568 --> 20:39.167
full face of makeup.

20:39.169 --> 20:42.971
She walked the mall every
single day for 17 years.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.172
She was
in charge of the mall,

20:44.174 --> 20:45.440
she kind of watched
over the place,

20:45.442 --> 20:46.975
made sure everybody
was doing

20:46.977 --> 20:48.242
what they were supposed
to be doing, and behaving.

20:48.244 --> 20:49.845
So what happened
with the homicide?

20:49.847 --> 20:51.179
What were
the circumstances?

20:51.181 --> 20:52.981
November 10, 1995.

20:52.983 --> 20:55.517
She doesn't show up, so
everybody grows concerned.

20:55.519 --> 20:56.852
Where is she?

20:56.854 --> 20:58.186
So they contact
the apartment manager,

20:58.188 --> 21:00.122
and at that point, he
does a welfare check,

21:00.124 --> 21:02.190
and that's when they find her
deceased in her apartment.

21:02.192 --> 21:04.326
Did the house look like there
was a crime scene there?

21:04.328 --> 21:06.528
So initially it wasn't
all that suspicious.

21:06.530 --> 21:07.729
There's no evidence
of a struggle,

21:07.731 --> 21:09.197
there's no evidence
of foul play.

21:09.199 --> 21:11.933
It just looks like an
elderly woman who has died.

21:11.935 --> 21:13.335
It's not until
the autopsy's done

21:13.337 --> 21:15.937
that we find out that she's
got some significant injuries.

21:15.939 --> 21:17.672
It looks like
she's been strangled

21:17.674 --> 21:18.873
and
possibly smothered.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.676
She's got hemorrhages in
her neck, bleeding, bruises,

21:21.678 --> 21:23.078
breaks of the bones
in the neck,

21:23.080 --> 21:26.014
all suggestive or indicative
of strangulation.

21:26.016 --> 21:28.350
And here's an article
on the case here.

21:30.754 --> 21:32.421
Did they have anybody
that they liked?

21:32.423 --> 21:34.556
They talked to friends,
families, neighbors, everybody.

21:34.558 --> 21:36.758
Really couldn't come up
with a solid suspect.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.759
This is still considered

21:37.761 --> 21:39.360
an active
homicide investigation.

21:39.362 --> 21:40.695
Okay.

21:43.767 --> 21:46.567
I'm seeing that angry
dead woman again.

21:46.569 --> 21:48.770
Can you describe
the way she looks?

21:48.772 --> 21:54.376
Probably my height, dark
brown hair in a bob.

21:54.378 --> 21:55.510
And she's white.

21:55.512 --> 21:57.779
I'd put her in her 30s.

21:57.781 --> 22:00.916
She's either from
the 1950s, 1960s.

22:00.918 --> 22:04.753
It seemed like
she belonged here.

22:06.991 --> 22:09.991
So I'm thinking possibly,

22:09.993 --> 22:12.060
I don't know if
she was an owner,

22:12.062 --> 22:15.330
or her husband was an owner,
but she lived here.

22:15.332 --> 22:18.466
And she was a neat freak,
homemaker.

22:18.468 --> 22:20.802
And she was, like, perfect,

22:20.804 --> 22:23.905
and the female showed
me hanging herself.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.875
God.

22:34.551 --> 22:36.485

23:00.542 --> 23:03.076
Another thing caught
my attention in research.

23:03.078 --> 23:05.745
Back in the '80s,
a 15-year-old girl went missing

23:05.747 --> 23:08.548
just about a mile from
Jordan and Lorie's house.

23:08.550 --> 23:11.017
So I reached out to the
city's retired sheriff.

23:11.019 --> 23:13.219
Now, he remembers the case well

23:13.221 --> 23:16.023
and says she was the victim
of a prolific killer.

23:21.229 --> 23:22.696
Well, John, thanks
for hooking me up

23:22.698 --> 23:24.431
and coming out and helping
me out with this case.

23:24.433 --> 23:26.700
So the girl that disappeared
near my clients' house,

23:26.702 --> 23:28.301
what were
the circumstances?

23:28.303 --> 23:30.571
It was November of 1987,

23:30.573 --> 23:33.506
15-year-old Rocio Sperry
just went missing,

23:33.508 --> 23:35.442
no leads, nothing to
go on at the time.

23:35.444 --> 23:37.244
The case pretty much
went cold right away.

23:37.246 --> 23:39.112
Okay, so now,
obviously, there was

23:39.114 --> 23:41.048
a break in the case
that occurred, right?

23:41.050 --> 23:42.983
Right.
So what happened?

23:42.985 --> 23:44.518
The real break in
that case came in '95

23:44.520 --> 23:45.986
when I was
elected Sheriff,

23:45.988 --> 23:49.456
and I reopened a
homicide case from 1991,

23:49.458 --> 23:52.125
where a 13-year-old girl,
Heather Dawn Church,

23:52.127 --> 23:55.795
who was abducted from
her home in that case.

23:55.797 --> 23:57.330
Okay, so you got
this homicide.

23:57.332 --> 23:58.732
Any evidence at all?

23:58.734 --> 24:01.000
The only evidence we had on
Heather Dawn Church's case

24:01.002 --> 24:02.669
were some
latent fingerprints

24:02.671 --> 24:05.005
that were at the crime scene
where she was abducted,

24:05.007 --> 24:06.940
where we were able to
identify the prints

24:06.942 --> 24:09.076
from a convicted felon
out of Louisiana

24:09.078 --> 24:11.010
by the name of
Robert Charles Brown.

24:11.012 --> 24:13.546
This is him here?
That's him.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.081
What happened next, did
you guys make the collar?

24:15.083 --> 24:16.282
We got him, yeah.

24:16.284 --> 24:17.350
Initially he denied it,

24:17.352 --> 24:18.885
was adamant that
he wasn't there.

24:18.887 --> 24:20.554
He didn't know the family,
never been on the property.

24:20.556 --> 24:22.155
As we got closer to court,

24:22.157 --> 24:24.358
he did confess, he
gave us enough details

24:24.360 --> 24:26.693
to convince us that
he was responsible,

24:26.695 --> 24:28.695
and he did take
a life sentence.

24:28.697 --> 24:31.030
All right, so now
you've got a confession,

24:31.032 --> 24:33.033
life sentence, how do
you guys connect him

24:33.035 --> 24:34.834
to the Rocio
disappearance?

24:34.836 --> 24:36.637
Once he was in prison,

24:36.639 --> 24:39.639
he started sending
these cryptic messages,

24:39.641 --> 24:41.108
and we finally got enough

24:41.110 --> 24:44.378
that we confronted him
on the Rocio Sperry case.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.246
He confessed, gave
us intimate details

24:46.248 --> 24:47.647
that only
a killer would know.

24:47.649 --> 24:48.915
What information
did he give you?

24:48.917 --> 24:50.384
That he picked her up
at a convenience store,

24:50.386 --> 24:52.919
took her back to his
apartment, they had sex.

24:52.921 --> 24:54.387
Afterwards,
he strangled her,

24:54.389 --> 24:55.988
then he dismembered her,

24:55.990 --> 25:00.527
and took her dismembered parts
and put them in a Dumpster.

25:00.529 --> 25:02.528
He is serving two life
sentences here in Colorado,

25:02.530 --> 25:05.732
and he's about an hour south
of your clients' property.

25:05.734 --> 25:07.334
So now, you mentioned
on the phone

25:07.336 --> 25:08.868
what a prolific
killer this guy was.

25:08.870 --> 25:10.470
Did you like him for
any other homicides?

25:10.472 --> 25:11.671
We did.

25:11.673 --> 25:15.475
In fact, he confessed to
as many as 49 murders.

25:15.477 --> 25:18.478
Wow.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.747
Okay, so he's
claiming he killed 49.

25:20.749 --> 25:23.683
How many were you able
to actually pin on him?

25:23.685 --> 25:25.485
We confirmed seven,
total.

25:25.487 --> 25:27.354
But I think he's really
good for all of them.

25:27.356 --> 25:28.955
I think this guy
is one of the most

25:28.957 --> 25:31.491
prolific serial killers
in American history.

25:31.493 --> 25:32.492
Okay.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.768
I feel like a very
evil person is here.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.103
I think it's a man.

25:43.105 --> 25:45.104
I don't feel comfortable.

25:45.106 --> 25:48.775
I'm seeing some
weird ****

25:48.777 --> 25:52.446
I'm seeing a guy, like,
dismember a woman's body.

25:54.516 --> 25:57.250
I think this guy
is a serial killer.

25:57.252 --> 26:00.320
I'm seeing this scene
of this guy, like,

26:00.322 --> 26:02.855
totally wrecking this chick,

26:02.857 --> 26:08.729
and feeling, like, high,

26:08.731 --> 26:13.199
like, angry, like, sad.

26:13.201 --> 26:19.206
I'm feeling all of
these weird emotions.

26:19.208 --> 26:22.341
These emotions are

26:22.343 --> 26:24.945
very, very, very strong,

26:24.947 --> 26:28.548
feeling this sadness

26:28.550 --> 26:30.817
and this anger.

26:30.819 --> 26:32.685
There's so much anger

26:32.687 --> 26:36.756
and so much, like,
murderous intent here,

26:36.758 --> 26:40.827
I'm afraid that somebody here

26:40.829 --> 26:44.164
could become a killer.

26:44.166 --> 26:47.167
I think murderers
would be, like, bred here

26:47.169 --> 26:50.704
and could either kill
here or kill elsewhere.

26:57.246 --> 26:59.713
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

26:59.715 --> 27:03.182
but the angry dead woman
tormenting a living person

27:03.184 --> 27:05.385
concerns me the most.

27:05.387 --> 27:09.256
She had
perfect hair, brown,

27:09.258 --> 27:13.793
more of a squared jaw,
longer face.

27:13.795 --> 27:15.795
But instead of a hand
or fingers,

27:15.797 --> 27:20.533
she just has these little,
long, black snakes.

27:20.535 --> 27:22.803
Her hair's a bit
longer and thinner.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.003
Okay.

27:29.144 --> 27:32.279
Amy,
is this what you saw?

27:32.281 --> 27:34.014
Yes,
that's what I saw.

27:59.641 --> 28:02.909
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:02.911 --> 28:04.710
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:04.712 --> 28:07.714
and our clients
for the first time.

28:07.716 --> 28:10.850
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Jordan and her wife, Lorie.

28:10.852 --> 28:13.920
Now, these two aren't
our typical clients.

28:13.922 --> 28:16.857
Matter of fact, they're
paranormal investigators.

28:16.859 --> 28:20.260
So, as you can imagine, things
had to be pretty bad here

28:20.262 --> 28:21.928
for them to call us in for help.

28:21.930 --> 28:24.598
They both agreed the
activity here is dangerous

28:24.600 --> 28:27.533
and they're hoping you can find
a solution where they couldn't.

28:27.535 --> 28:30.871
So, now that Amy
knows who you guys are,

28:30.873 --> 28:32.605
we'll hear about her walk.

28:36.478 --> 28:38.545
So when I walked
into the house,

28:38.547 --> 28:41.081
I encountered a female.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.282
She was very petite.

28:43.284 --> 28:46.353
To me, it looked like she
was probably in her 60s.

28:46.355 --> 28:50.891
I felt like this woman
lived here at some point.

28:50.893 --> 28:56.096
I really couldn't
tell you how she died,

28:56.098 --> 29:00.099
but she was complaining
about her head.

29:00.101 --> 29:04.904
Seemed to me that she
had some kind of issue

29:04.906 --> 29:06.706
with her brain.

29:06.708 --> 29:10.576
The way that I felt the
living would experience her

29:10.578 --> 29:13.713
would be headaches.

29:13.715 --> 29:17.049
I thought even to
the point of migraines.

29:17.051 --> 29:20.252
I really felt that
it was possible

29:20.254 --> 29:25.525
the living would at times
hear her crying out for help.

29:25.527 --> 29:27.193
The other thing
I felt was

29:27.195 --> 29:30.196
because of this
immense depression

29:30.198 --> 29:32.332
that she goes
into at times,

29:32.334 --> 29:35.601
I felt that the living
would experience that

29:35.603 --> 29:37.403
empathically with her.

29:37.405 --> 29:39.272
So that's
the first person.

29:39.274 --> 29:40.607
You okay?

29:40.609 --> 29:42.008
Yeah.

29:42.010 --> 29:44.744
I know who
she's talking about.

29:44.746 --> 29:46.346
Now would probably be
a good time

29:46.348 --> 29:49.715
for you to tell Amy
who Nora was.

29:49.717 --> 29:51.418
Nora was my ex.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.419
We were together
for 27 years.

29:56.024 --> 29:59.091
She had a -- sorry --
a brain condition.

29:59.093 --> 30:00.826
She was an epileptic.

30:00.828 --> 30:03.029
She died in
a nursing home in 2014.

30:03.031 --> 30:03.963
Right.

30:03.965 --> 30:05.698
And she was, what, 52?
Yeah.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.966
And you've experienced
some of the things

30:06.968 --> 30:08.234
Amy was talking about,
right?

30:08.236 --> 30:10.703
Everything
you said made sense.

30:10.705 --> 30:13.172
When she mentioned about
the voice crying out,

30:13.174 --> 30:14.840
you told me you were on
the couch, remember that?

30:14.842 --> 30:17.110
Yeah,
as I was falling asleep,

30:17.112 --> 30:21.514
a woman in my ear
cried out, "Help me."

30:21.516 --> 30:22.848
Now, Amy --
she mentioned something

30:22.850 --> 30:23.783
about sudden headaches.

30:23.785 --> 30:24.851
Do either one of
you ever get those?

30:24.853 --> 30:26.386
She does a lot.

30:26.388 --> 30:28.188
They're bad.
They're terrible.

30:28.190 --> 30:31.791
And I, you know, take bottles
of aspirin and Tylenol

30:31.793 --> 30:32.993
all night, whatever,

30:32.995 --> 30:34.927
and it just --
nothing touches it.

30:34.929 --> 30:37.730
The depression in our
house is unbearable.

30:37.732 --> 30:39.566
Some days you don't
even want to get up.

30:41.403 --> 30:43.336
Okay,
so what else went on?

30:43.338 --> 30:44.938
There's two dead people

30:44.940 --> 30:47.740
that I'm extremely
concerned about.

30:47.742 --> 30:51.010
The first one I want
to talk about is a male

30:51.012 --> 30:54.080
that I encountered
initially outside,

30:54.082 --> 30:57.216
thin, short, in his 30s.

30:57.218 --> 31:00.686
Got that he was ex-military
or war vet.

31:00.688 --> 31:03.556
Something really
off about this dude.

31:03.558 --> 31:05.892
He's covered in mud,

31:05.894 --> 31:11.898
and on his chest,
he wrote "Killer."

31:11.900 --> 31:15.368
He's angry and lost
and he's lashing out.

31:15.370 --> 31:19.906
I saw him, at one point,
attacking a female

31:19.908 --> 31:21.641
and dismembering her.

31:21.643 --> 31:23.976
It seemed liked he was
getting some kind of high

31:23.978 --> 31:26.179
or relief
from doing this.

31:26.181 --> 31:28.915
And that made me
feel like

31:28.917 --> 31:32.452
he could have been
a serial killer.

31:32.454 --> 31:34.053
Some of what you're saying
reminds me of one of the most

31:34.055 --> 31:36.589
prolific serial killers
in U.S. history.

31:36.591 --> 31:38.924
His name was
Robert Charles Browne,

31:38.926 --> 31:42.195
and he was active here
in this neighborhood.

31:42.197 --> 31:44.731
I got his photo right here.

31:44.733 --> 31:47.200
Like the guy you saw,
Browne was an army vet.

31:47.202 --> 31:50.403
In fact, he got dishonorably
discharged for drug use.

31:50.405 --> 31:53.339
In 1987, he abducted and
killed a 15-year-old girl

31:53.341 --> 31:56.876
named Rocio Sperry, now,
just about a mile from here.

31:56.878 --> 32:00.146
When cops interrogated him,
he confessed to strangling

32:00.148 --> 32:03.883
Rocio Sperry, dismembering
her body before he threw

32:03.885 --> 32:06.219
her parts into
different Dumpsters.

32:06.221 --> 32:08.687
So, the thing is,
Browne's not dead.

32:08.689 --> 32:11.223
He's actually serving two
life sentences in a prison

32:11.225 --> 32:13.092
about an hour south of here.

32:13.094 --> 32:14.561
But since he's been in prison,

32:14.563 --> 32:17.296
Browne has confessed to
killing dozens of more women.

32:17.298 --> 32:20.633
If he's telling the truth,
49 innocent victims.

32:20.635 --> 32:24.036
Normally I wouldn't
have even mentioned it

32:24.038 --> 32:26.639
because this guy's still alive,
but in past investigations,

32:26.641 --> 32:28.775
you've mentioned
serial killers can leave

32:28.777 --> 32:31.911
fragments of their mind behind.

32:31.913 --> 32:35.648
Yes, there can be
fragments of personality,

32:35.650 --> 32:37.784
they leave a part
of themselves there.

32:37.786 --> 32:40.119
Could that be what's
going on here?

32:40.121 --> 32:42.121
More than likely,
yes.

32:44.993 --> 32:49.195
We were called in to do
an investigation at a location

32:49.197 --> 32:51.931
that was considered
his hunting ground.

32:51.933 --> 32:55.335
We have done over 50
investigations of that location

32:55.337 --> 32:57.537
in reference to him.

32:57.539 --> 33:01.006
Makes sense because one
of the things I got was,

33:01.008 --> 33:03.876
I said, this person
has an attachment

33:03.878 --> 33:05.712
to someone in this house.

33:07.015 --> 33:08.548
Now, you told me
you thought you picked

33:08.550 --> 33:10.416
someone up on another
investigation.

33:10.418 --> 33:11.551
Tell Amy.

33:11.553 --> 33:13.953
We did an investigation
in Denver.

33:13.955 --> 33:17.090
I had a very violent attack,
threw me across the room.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.691
Picked me up and threw
me across the room.

33:18.693 --> 33:21.360
Could have sworn that
we brought him home

33:21.362 --> 33:26.833
because I've had many, many
violent attacks on me

33:26.835 --> 33:28.167
in the home.

33:28.169 --> 33:30.970
From what Amy's saying,
these violent attacks

33:30.972 --> 33:33.506
may not be from where
you thought it was.

33:33.508 --> 33:34.774
This guy might have
been attached to you

33:34.776 --> 33:37.443
before you even went
to the hotel in Denver.

33:37.445 --> 33:38.510
****

33:38.512 --> 33:40.313
So what kind of experiences

33:40.315 --> 33:42.648
would they have with
this serial killer?

33:42.650 --> 33:45.051
I'm seeing him in the
basement freaking out,

33:45.053 --> 33:46.920
punching
and slamming things.

33:46.922 --> 33:49.855
I thought it was possible
living would hear this.

33:49.857 --> 33:51.124
Tell her about the noises

33:51.126 --> 33:52.859
you're hearing in the bedroom,
the banging.

33:52.861 --> 33:55.361
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

33:55.363 --> 33:56.796
Terrible, horrible banging.

33:56.798 --> 34:01.000
Be, like, I'm expecting to
see a hole in the wall.

34:01.002 --> 34:02.935
Another thing I
saw him doing was

34:02.937 --> 34:05.605
crawling up and down
the basement stairs.

34:05.607 --> 34:07.673
The living here
would see

34:07.675 --> 34:11.143
this, like, weirdly shaped
kind of shadow thing.

34:11.146 --> 34:12.210
You're going
up the stairs,

34:12.213 --> 34:13.612
feels like someone's
on your ass.

34:13.614 --> 34:15.214
You know, if you don't
hurry the hell up,

34:15.216 --> 34:17.683
you're gonna
get run right over.

34:17.685 --> 34:19.284
Tell Amy about
the shadow figures.

34:19.286 --> 34:21.221
I seem to have
an issue with someone

34:21.223 --> 34:23.755
in the very corner
of the bedroom.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.491
Very tall, very looming.

34:25.493 --> 34:26.759
Now, Lorie, you've seen

34:26.761 --> 34:28.226
the shadow figures
as well, though?

34:28.228 --> 34:30.829
Yeah, his head almost reaches
the top of the door frame.

34:30.831 --> 34:34.166
And he's tall, you can
obviously tells he's a man.

34:34.168 --> 34:35.435
He's taunting me.

34:35.437 --> 34:37.969
He bothers me to death.

34:37.972 --> 34:41.239
And the other thing I
was nervous about was

34:41.242 --> 34:43.042
the fact that he
could get physical,

34:43.043 --> 34:44.510
punching, hitting,
stuff like that.

34:44.512 --> 34:47.179
I was physically punched
in the back so hard

34:47.181 --> 34:49.649
that it knocked me
to my knees

34:49.650 --> 34:51.384
and I couldn't move
for a week.

34:51.386 --> 34:52.752
I had to go to the E.R.

34:52.754 --> 34:54.320
You also got pushed
against the wall?

34:54.322 --> 34:57.123
Like I was being arrested,
pushed down, tight

34:57.125 --> 35:00.059
and held there for
at least 10, 15 seconds,

35:00.061 --> 35:01.193
just held there.

35:01.195 --> 35:02.328
I couldn't move.

35:02.330 --> 35:04.998
He's a real threat,
full of rage.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.265
And I'm very concerned

35:06.267 --> 35:08.334
because he's trying
to influence you

35:08.336 --> 35:10.470
to either become
a serial killer

35:10.472 --> 35:12.372
or kill yourselves.

35:14.475 --> 35:15.942
Be sitting here
talking to you

35:15.944 --> 35:17.143
and the next thing
you know,

35:17.145 --> 35:19.345
I want to rip your
**** head off.

35:19.347 --> 35:22.615
And I don't even know who
I am and I go after her

35:22.617 --> 35:25.485
and I scream and I yell
and I get in her face.

35:25.487 --> 35:27.086
This is really bad.

35:30.825 --> 35:34.761
So the next dead person I
encountered was a female.

35:34.763 --> 35:37.897
White. I thought she
lived here at some point.

35:37.899 --> 35:41.834
Time period I got
was '50s to '60s.

35:41.836 --> 35:48.241
This woman is,
like, put together.

35:48.243 --> 35:49.842
I mean, perfect.

35:49.844 --> 35:54.080
Like the epitome of
a 1950s housewife.

35:54.082 --> 35:56.315
I did ask her
how she died.

35:56.317 --> 35:57.917
She actually flashed
a picture to me,

35:57.919 --> 36:01.387
which was her
hanging by her neck.

36:01.389 --> 36:03.522
Okay, so,
it may be a long shot,

36:03.524 --> 36:06.658
but there are a few things you
said that remind me of a woman

36:06.660 --> 36:08.594
I came across in research.

36:08.596 --> 36:10.663
Now, her name was Marjorie Mock.

36:10.665 --> 36:13.399
She was a housewife, she
lived in the apartment complex

36:13.401 --> 36:14.801
across the street.

36:14.803 --> 36:16.335
You said the woman you saw
was from the '50s or '60s.

36:16.337 --> 36:20.673
Now, Marjorie came to
Colorado Springs in 1960.

36:20.675 --> 36:22.008
What really got my
attention is when you said

36:22.010 --> 36:24.343
how meticulous the woman
you saw was.

36:24.345 --> 36:27.947
Every single day for 17 years,

36:27.949 --> 36:31.884
she would dress up to the nines,
do her hair, the make-up

36:31.886 --> 36:34.019
and go walk around
the local mall.

36:34.021 --> 36:35.888
She never missed a day.

36:35.890 --> 36:39.025
But on November 10, 1995,
she didn't show up.

36:39.027 --> 36:41.627
People got worried about her,
they did a wellness check

36:41.629 --> 36:44.096
and the manager found
her dead in bed.

36:44.098 --> 36:46.432
Now, Marjorie was 96
at the time of her death.

36:46.434 --> 36:47.700
Holy ****

36:47.702 --> 36:51.704
So, authorities figured
it was natural causes.

36:51.706 --> 36:53.906
But after the autopsy,
the coroner determined

36:53.908 --> 36:55.841
that she had been murdered.

36:55.843 --> 36:59.045
Her cause of death was
most likely strangulation.

36:59.047 --> 37:02.048
Unfortunately, still an
unsolved homicide to this day.

37:02.050 --> 37:05.050
Actually I have
a picture of her.

37:05.052 --> 37:07.487
****
That makes sense now.

37:09.123 --> 37:12.925
She has it out for a living
woman in the house.

37:12.927 --> 37:17.196
She refuses to let this
living woman sleep.

37:17.198 --> 37:20.599
That's when she messes
with her the most.

37:20.601 --> 37:23.535
She wants to do as much
physical harm as possible,

37:23.537 --> 37:26.338
she's building up to this,
torturing the person.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.207
Living people
might see her.

37:28.209 --> 37:30.943
She showed me her
twisting her face.

37:30.945 --> 37:33.879
So I look up or
whatever and this woman,

37:33.881 --> 37:37.150
she was a little lady,
sweet, little lady, I thought.

37:37.152 --> 37:40.219
She, like, changed
into this creature,

37:40.221 --> 37:43.289
rushed up
right into the doorway

37:43.291 --> 37:44.623
and then, pah,
it was gone.

37:44.625 --> 37:48.561
Scared me so bad and
I don't frighten easily.

37:48.563 --> 37:51.430
And it was her.
I know it was her.

37:51.432 --> 37:53.766
Do we think that everything
that's happened to Lorie

37:53.768 --> 37:56.235
is coming from this woman?

37:56.237 --> 37:59.238
Yes.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.308
So, I did
a sketch of something

38:02.310 --> 38:06.512
that she showed me
her doing one night.

38:13.988 --> 38:17.123
The face of an old lady.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.123
Wow.

38:18.125 --> 38:21.593
I don't like that.
That's horrible.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.729
I don't like that much at all.

38:23.731 --> 38:25.631
So, is this lady
attacking Lorie?

38:25.633 --> 38:26.866
Yes.

38:30.672 --> 38:34.673
How am I supposed
to take care of this?

38:34.675 --> 38:36.408
I don't think she
can take much more

38:36.410 --> 38:38.611
mentally or physically.

38:38.613 --> 38:42.548
Just want to see her smile,
I just want her happy.

38:42.550 --> 38:45.284
And I can't help her.

38:45.286 --> 38:47.619
Obviously you have
a dangerous situation.

38:47.621 --> 38:51.557
Thing about her, too, is
she has inserted herself,

38:51.559 --> 38:52.758
and she wants you out.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.894
She made it clear
that she will kill

38:54.896 --> 38:57.296
if that's what it
absolutely takes.

38:59.166 --> 39:00.832
- I'm terrified!
- Okay.

39:00.834 --> 39:01.700
I'm scared ****less.

39:01.702 --> 39:04.169
I'm pissed, I'm infuriated.

39:04.171 --> 39:06.639
I can't touch what this is.

39:06.641 --> 39:08.441
Want to hurt someone?
You come, hurt me.

39:08.443 --> 39:09.775
Whatever you want to do,
you do to me,

39:09.777 --> 39:12.444
but leave mine alone.

39:12.446 --> 39:14.647
Yeah.

39:36.137 --> 39:37.202
So, Jordan, I know it wasn't
easy for you to call us in,

39:37.204 --> 39:38.604
but it's a really
good thing you did.

39:38.606 --> 39:39.872
I mean, the problem here

39:39.874 --> 39:41.073
is even more dangerous
here than you thought.

39:41.075 --> 39:43.209
So now it's time to
answer the big question.

39:43.211 --> 39:45.010
Is there any way to fix this?

39:45.012 --> 39:46.612
Or do you need to pack up
and get out of here

39:46.614 --> 39:49.482
while you still have
your lives to leave with?

39:49.484 --> 39:51.417
And for that answer,
I'm gonna turn over to Amy.

39:55.048 --> 39:57.115
So, the first thing
that needs to be done

39:57.117 --> 39:59.784
is that the house
needs to be cleaned

39:59.786 --> 40:01.186
from top to bottom.

40:01.188 --> 40:04.989
On every possible item,

40:04.991 --> 40:08.994
surface, windows, walls,

40:08.996 --> 40:14.165
and just
saltwater everything.

40:14.167 --> 40:16.267
Now, the reason why
you're doing this is to

40:16.269 --> 40:19.638
remove stagnate energy
that's accumulated.

40:21.542 --> 40:25.810
Once you've done that,
the second step is

40:25.812 --> 40:30.015
you will need to
get a shaman for you

40:30.017 --> 40:33.618
and a Reiki master for you.

40:33.620 --> 40:36.154
Have these individuals come
to the house at the same time.

40:36.156 --> 40:39.891
You're gonna go to the
basement with the shaman.

40:39.893 --> 40:43.762
That shaman is going to
do a removal ceremony

40:43.764 --> 40:45.296
and then a blessing.

40:45.298 --> 40:48.032
Then you,
at the same time,

40:48.034 --> 40:49.167
are going to go
to your couch,

40:49.169 --> 40:51.302
upstairs
in the family area

40:51.304 --> 40:54.172
to have a clearing
and cord cutting done

40:54.174 --> 40:55.907
by the Reiki master.

40:55.909 --> 40:59.177
Once this is done, the
shaman and Reiki master,

40:59.179 --> 41:01.913
they're going to
remove and block

41:01.915 --> 41:04.316
the fragment left behind
by the serial killer

41:04.318 --> 41:07.585
as well as
the angry old lady.

41:07.587 --> 41:11.656
Now, the next day,
the Reiki master only,

41:11.658 --> 41:15.427
comes back
and moves Nora on.

41:17.531 --> 41:18.663
So, in the meantime,

41:18.665 --> 41:20.598
do they need to stop
doing investigations?

41:20.600 --> 41:23.001
Yes, take a little
bit of a break.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.469
We definitely need
to do that, I think.

41:24.471 --> 41:26.805
Now, if they do this, will
they start to feel better?

41:26.807 --> 41:28.273
You're gonna feel
a lot better.

41:28.275 --> 41:29.875
I hope so.

41:29.877 --> 41:31.409
Least we can see a light

41:31.411 --> 41:32.677
at the end of the tunnel,
I think.

41:32.679 --> 41:34.479
There is hope.

41:34.481 --> 41:35.881
You gonna take Amy's advice?

41:37.885 --> 41:39.284
Absolutely.

41:39.286 --> 41:40.819
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

41:40.821 --> 41:42.353
Okay.

41:42.355 --> 41:43.888
I think it's doable,
yeah, it's a lot of work,

41:43.890 --> 41:45.290
but I'm willing
to do it.

41:45.292 --> 41:47.025
We're gonna start
immediately.

41:47.027 --> 41:49.093
Well, I'm glad we
were able to help.

41:49.095 --> 41:50.762
I'm more thankful
than you know.

41:50.764 --> 41:54.232
I happy,
I'm extremely happy.

41:56.837 --> 41:59.304
Jordan and Lorie have
a lot of work ahead of them,

41:59.306 --> 42:02.440
but I'm confident that
if they follow my advice,

42:02.442 --> 42:04.909
they'll be able to live
in their house in peace.

42:09.782 --> 42:11.383
Hey, guys, it's
Jordan and Lorie.

42:11.385 --> 42:12.784
Wanted to let you know

42:12.786 --> 42:15.186
that after Amy and Steve
were here,

42:15.188 --> 42:16.922
we did everything
that Amy said

42:16.924 --> 42:19.390
and we're happy to say
that the house is cleared.

42:19.392 --> 42:23.061
The awful thing that was
threatening our lives even,

42:23.063 --> 42:24.262
is out, is gone.

42:24.264 --> 42:25.796
It's beautiful
and we want to thank

42:25.798 --> 42:27.599
you guys for everything
that you did.

42:27.601 --> 42:28.934
Thanks so much.
Thanks, guys.
