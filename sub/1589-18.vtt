ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars
You guys seriously think

00:03.630 --> 00:05.495
Mona's body's in that barrel?

00:05.530 --> 00:08.431
Yes.
That storage unit was rented
in Hannah's name 4 months ago.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.303
Three acceptance letters.
Aren't you gonna open them?

00:11.340 --> 00:15.629
When I made that comment
about Ezra being cute--

00:15.680 --> 00:19.776
Yeah.
I said it because
I'm interested in you.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.744
Looks like they recorded
every one of her sessions.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.644
Wait, are we stealing
this stuff? _
We're borrowmg It.

00:24.690 --> 00:28.786
What are you saying?
If we stay together,
you might grow to resent me.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.754
HANNA: Why would you tell Toby
about the storage unit?
SPENCER: I didn't.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.496
Well, then
how come he and Tanner
showed up there today?

00:32.530 --> 00:34.259
_ Because Holbrook broke
Into your computer, Hanna.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.722
He knew that you were going
to the storage unit.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.364
You screwed yourself
by going in there.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.368
If those drops of blood
match her DNA,

00:39.400 --> 00:40.799
yourfnends
will be the first people

00:40.840 --> 00:42.262
I bring in
for a questioning.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.164
What was in the barrel?
I can't talk about it.

00:48.310 --> 00:51.700
Can Toby tell you if it was
human remains in that drum?

00:51.750 --> 00:53.411
They don't know.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.044
But even if he did,
he probably wouldn't tell me.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.209
Are you guys okay?

00:58.250 --> 01:02.152
We are some distance
removed from okay.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.284
I'm sorry.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.525
I know why he joined
the police force.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.096
I encouraged him.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.098
He's the most honorable person
that I know

01:11.130 --> 01:15.294
_ and it's like_now
this IS tearing hIm apart.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.807
I'm tearing him apart.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.079
Is that your mom?

01:27.220 --> 01:29.313
Yeah, that's her.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.581
Lawyers working on a Saturday,
that's serious.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.180
My mom says
you get more with a smile

01:35.220 --> 01:36.619
than with a subpoena.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.287
What is she trying
to get from them?

01:38.330 --> 01:40.321
Those two are
Ali's defense team.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.590
My mom is a paid
strategical consultant.

01:42.630 --> 01:45.167
Your mom's helping
Ali's defense?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.498
No, not helping,
just consulting.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.428
She'll get more out of them
than they will out of her.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.732
Okay, but why is she
even doing it at all?

01:50.770 --> 01:52.135
Because she wants to know
what they know.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.772
Such as?

01:53.810 --> 01:56.404
Such as who gets
called to testify.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.406
Yeah.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.295
Wish me luck.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.695
Luck.
Luck.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.233
Ezra in there?

02:20.270 --> 02:22.465
No.
He's in Harrisburg
for the weekend.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.863
Oh.

02:23.910 --> 02:24.934
You didn't know?

02:24.970 --> 02:28.235
No, I knew.
I just forgot.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.872
You forgot?
Or he forgot to tell you?

02:29.910 --> 02:32.879
Immw.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.657
Just give me 2 minutes, please.
I have to try to fix this.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.487
There's nothing to fix.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.657
Don't say that.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.379
Spence, you were right.

02:45.430 --> 02:46.590
I was?

02:46.630 --> 02:48.518
Yeah.
I thought about it.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.824
And I thought about it
in the tub for so long,

02:50.870 --> 02:53.737
my fingers started
to look like prunes.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.637
It was a bad idea,
trying to get that stuff
out of the storage space.

02:56.670 --> 02:57.898
I panicked.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.430
Panic's a bitch.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.869
I just hope I didn't make
things incredibly worse.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.839
You're not pruney anymore.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.283
I moisturized.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.785
Hey.

03:13.820 --> 03:14.809
Are we good?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.327
We're good.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.591
Maybe not so good.

03:25.470 --> 03:26.869
ARIA: Oh, my God,
it's Holbrook.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.808
So much for family emergencies
and special assignments.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.377
What is Holbrook doing back here
after all this time?

03:34.410 --> 03:37.402
ARIA: Ali probably wants him
torturing us in close range.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.842
Forget about torturing,

03:42.620 --> 03:43.848
EMILY: He was doing
such a good job.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.279
Why bring him out in the open?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.254
Spence?

03:51.790 --> 03:54.554
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:54.600 --> 03:57.319
* Swear this one you'll save

03:57.370 --> 03:59.668
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:59.700 --> 04:02.032
* Taking this one
to the grave *

04:02.070 --> 04:04.459
* IfI show you, then I know

04:04.510 --> 04:07.399
* You won't tell what I said

04:07.440 --> 04:09.749
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

04:13.820 --> 04:14.718
Why bring Holbrook
out in the open like that?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.480
So we know he's here,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.556
_ to scare us _
Without domg anything.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.057
It's pretty
passive aggressive.

04:21.090 --> 04:22.853
I And "All I
IS aggressnve aggresswe.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.484
Well, Ali probably wants people
inside that building

04:25.530 --> 04:27.054
for the same reason
your mom

04:27.100 --> 04:29.022
is making chummy
with Ali's lawyers.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.925
Inside information.

04:32.070 --> 04:34.493
I'll be right back.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.632
Guys, Ali is going
to be tried

04:35.670 --> 04:37.035
and she is going
to be convicted.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.367
The closer we get
to the trial,

04:38.410 --> 04:39.536
the more desperate
she's going to get.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.572
And the more dangerous.
( cell phone rings )

04:42.610 --> 04:43.975
It's Caleb.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.654
Hi.
Hey.

04:58.690 --> 04:59.657
You moving in?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.053
No, I'm still at the barn.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.625
So what's all this then?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.736
Ezra liked
what I did for the opening.

05:06.770 --> 05:09.364
So he asked me what else
I could come up with.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.037
I told him I'd give him
something no one else had.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.571
A commission?

05:12.610 --> 05:14.407
A $200 commission.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.806
Whoa.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.976
What's it going to be?

05:18.010 --> 05:20.877
The only way to find out
is for you to help me build it.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.809
Really?
I'm kind of busy.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.818
I _don't_have
anytime right now.

05:25.850 --> 05:28.978
Oh, I guess you'll never know
what it does.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.658
Spencer, we have to talk.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.452
Okay.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.578
Hello.

05:50.610 --> 05:51.872
Good morning.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.008
Are you feeling better?

05:55.050 --> 05:57.416
Better?

05:57.450 --> 06:00.783
Um, Ezra left a note saying
you called in yesterday.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.755
Oh.
I wasn't sick.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.793
I just had to take care
of something.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.761
Oh.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.802
The police called Caleb.

06:28.780 --> 06:32.113
asking if he saw anyone there
acting suspicious.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.186
Aside from you?
Aria, you're not helping.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.427
Okay? They're going to
call me next. I know it.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.620
They're just trying
to make you nervous.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.059
Well, it's working.

06:39.090 --> 06:41.695
( cell phone rings )

06:41.730 --> 06:43.391
You better answer it.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.558
Thanks.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.033
Hey,
what can I get for you?

06:49.070 --> 06:51.459
Actually,
I'm looking for someone.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.579
Hanna Marin?

06:54.110 --> 06:56.806
Why are you looking
for Hanna Marin?

06:56.850 --> 07:01.116
Mrs. Vanderwaal said
I might find her here.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.812
My name is Lesli.
I was a friend of Mona's.

07:06.490 --> 07:07.787
I'm still having
really hard time

07:07.820 --> 07:10.129
believing what happened.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.526
So are we.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.596
I was supposed to see her
at Thanksgiving.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.860
I was there, with her mom,
when they called.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.467
They didn't say
she was dead.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.502
They're not allowed to tell you
that over the phone.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.804
They just said
that something had happened

07:24.840 --> 07:26.831
and she had to come back
to Rosewood.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.548
Did you know Mona
a long time?

07:35.580 --> 07:38.743
We met a couple of summers ago,
at her grandparents' place.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.759
I don't remember seeing you
at the memorial service.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.087
I had exams

07:43.130 --> 07:44.779
and a professor
who won't reschedule

07:44.830 --> 07:46.081
for anyone or anything.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.155
But you're here now.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.168
Just for the weekend.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.566
With that awful girl's
trial coming up,

07:52.600 --> 07:55.660
Mrs. Vanderwaal needs
all the support she can get.

07:55.700 --> 08:00.808
You girls were there for Mona
and her mom, and I wasn't.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.808
I want to thank you for that.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.781
Whoever Lesli is,
we need to keep an eye on her.

08:10.820 --> 08:13.709
You don't suppose she could be
who she says she is, do you?

08:13.760 --> 08:15.182
Sure.
She could be.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.983
But the last time somebody's
old friend came up to us

08:17.030 --> 08:18.725
in the Brew it was CeCe.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.820
Just go over there
and say hi to Mona's mom.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.124
Spencer,
I'm at the police station.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.262
Can't you feel
the police vibrations

08:25.300 --> 08:26.733
coming at you
through the phone?

08:26.770 --> 08:28.533
Okay, but when you leave
the police station,

08:28.570 --> 08:29.605
just go talk to Lesli.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.938
Just make sure that she does
most of the talking.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.303
Hanna, I really got to go, okay?
But you're gonna be fine.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.705
Okay.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.945
Mom?

09:05.140 --> 09:06.266
( camera shutter clicks )

09:06.310 --> 09:09.131
( car door closes,
alarm remote chirps )

09:18.620 --> 09:19.814
Hi, Mom.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.924
Spencen

09:22.960 --> 09:25.849
I saw you
talking to Holbrook today.

09:25.890 --> 09:26.891
Yes, he's back.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.194
That special assignment
all done?

09:29.230 --> 09:31.027
I wouldn't worry
about Holbrook.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.628
Why not?

09:33.940 --> 09:36.238
You and I have
something else to discuss.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.064
Where did you get those?

09:39.110 --> 09:41.203
These are acceptance letters
from colleges

09:41.240 --> 09:43.743
I didn't even _know
you were conSIderIng.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.668
How do you know that
they're acceptance letters, Mom?

09:45.710 --> 09:46.540
I never even opened them.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.343
They reject you
with a one-page letter.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.211
Saying "yes" requires
more paperwork.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.151
I don't-- I just applied so that
I would have more options

09:53.190 --> 09:54.782
and then I changed my mind.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.754
About what?

09:58.190 --> 10:00.090
Spencer,
we have to stay focused.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.189
You are going to go to college.

10:02.230 --> 10:03.891
I'm starting to think maybe

10:03.930 --> 10:05.397
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world ifI didn't.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.239
Sweetheart, you have been
thinking about college

10:07.270 --> 10:08.430
since the first grade.

10:08.470 --> 10:10.665
And maybe I should have been
thinking about something else.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.871
You have to keep your future
properly aligned.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.799
Then I'll go to a chiropractor.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.876
I am doing everything
possible to keep you

10:17.910 --> 10:20.071
from getting dragged
into Alison's trial.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.681
You staying on course
with college is part of that.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.642
Have I made myself clear?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.610
Yes, ma'am.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.394
My mom's gonna be here
in a couple of minutes.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.738
How is your mom?

10:43.770 --> 10:45.260
She's got a lot going on.

10:45.310 --> 10:46.402
She doesn't need this.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.704
Do you think
she's going to marry Ted?

10:48.740 --> 10:51.379
Doesn't matter what I think.

10:51.410 --> 10:55.141
It matters
what she wants.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.286
Caleb,
I had a bad thought.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.446
You know
that video of me and you

10:59.490 --> 11:02.152
that "A" used to trap
Spencer and Aria,

11:02.190 --> 11:03.851
what if the cops
get a hold of it?

11:03.890 --> 11:08.259
Well, we'll burn that bridge
when we come to it.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.165
_ At least _
It won't happen again.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.169
I've locked out remote access
to all of our computers.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.293
Nobody can tap
those cameras again.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.035
Hanna, there's nothing
connecting us

11:17.070 --> 11:19.903
to that busted lock
besides bad timing,

11:19.940 --> 11:21.771
and they can't arrest you
for that.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.141
Not yet.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.909
HOLBROOK: This department
has screwed up

11:24.950 --> 11:26.178
the investigation
from the start.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.313
And now you're trying
to blame it on me?

11:27.350 --> 11:29.841
You have no idea what's really
going on here, do you?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.414
Not a clue!
( door slams )

11:52.270 --> 11:53.874
Perfect.

12:03.790 --> 12:04.916
My mom is giving
strategic advice
to Ali's defense team

12:05.850 --> 12:07.488
and they're sharing
all kinds of information

12:07.520 --> 12:08.919
with her about the case,

12:08.960 --> 12:11.349
which includes
who's been visiting Ali in jail.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.119
There's a copy
of the visitors' log-in.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.458
I took a picture.
Is Hanna's name on the list?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.798
Yeah, but that's not the name
that's worrying me.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.865
N-What?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.935
No, that-that's gotta be
a mistake.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.837
How many Mike Montgomerys
do we know?

12:28.880 --> 12:32.509
Even if that is true,
he must have had a good reason.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.415
I mean, Alison
killed his girlfriend.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.974
He was probably just,
I don't know,

12:36.020 --> 12:37.487
going there
to spit in her eye.
Maybe.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.852
But then why didn't he mention
he was doing it?

12:39.890 --> 12:41.255
I don't know,

12:41.290 --> 12:42.848
but there's got to be
a good explanation.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.027
If there is an explanation,

12:44.060 --> 12:45.948
you're the only one
in a place to get it.

12:49.430 --> 12:50.897
They suspended Holbrook?

12:50.930 --> 12:52.864
For inappropriate behavior.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.561
What kind of
inappropriate behavior?

12:54.600 --> 12:55.931
Take your pick.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.335
Noodling with a witness?

12:57.370 --> 12:59.065
Letting Cyrus get away?

12:59.110 --> 13:00.134
Caleb heard
the cops talking about

13:00.180 --> 13:03.001
how Holbrook tampered
with the lie detector test.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.075
And that was the straw
that broke the chameleon's back.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.077
Well, if the cops
are onto him,

13:06.110 --> 13:07.873
that's one less thing
we have to worry about.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.547
You wouldn't say that if you saw
the way he looked at me.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.014
A" may have been leading him
around by the nose,

13:12.050 --> 13:14.086
but I think he blames us
for what happened to him.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.849
Yeah, I wish it didn't,

13:15.890 --> 13:17.118
but that makes an awful
lot of sense.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.354
Hey, you know what?

13:18.390 --> 13:19.857
Call Aria and Spencer.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.253
I have to go keep an eye
on the new girl in town.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.551
Okay.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.137
( dialing phone )

13:28.200 --> 13:29.394
( line out ringing )

13:31.610 --> 13:33.976
( line out ringing )

13:59.100 --> 14:00.169
Hey.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.307
Hey.

14:04.340 --> 14:05.364
MAN (in movie): Little girl!

14:07.510 --> 14:09.068
What's this?

14:09.110 --> 14:12.978
Mona had this list of movies
she wanted to show me.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.341
Ithought
I'd look at a couple.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.382
How's that going?

14:21.620 --> 14:23.622
Okay, I guess.

14:25.590 --> 14:28.195
It was a long time before
I could even look at her list,

14:28.230 --> 14:30.460
and here I am.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.459
Yeah,
Mona liked her movies.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.489
Yeah.

14:35.540 --> 14:39.237
I think she remembered
every mowe she ever saw.

14:39.270 --> 14:43.969
Not just the plot, but details--
all these little details.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.238
It was amazing.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.078
She was very smart.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.179
Too smart.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.057
MAN: Honey.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.199
What's your name?

15:07.470 --> 15:10.064
Who do you belong to?

15:16.180 --> 15:18.239
She told me
about this book.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.339
She said her grandfather
got it for her

15:20.380 --> 15:23.543
and he'd read to her from it
and scare the hell out of her.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.218
Mrs. Vanderwaal said that
you were trying to find me.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.616
Not just you,
the others.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.615
Why?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.684
That's a funny question.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.096
You were friends
of Mona's.

15:33.130 --> 15:37.396
Well, Lesli, if you really
knew Mona well,

15:37.430 --> 15:39.694
you would know that
what was between all of us

15:39.730 --> 15:41.732
was a lot more complicated
than going to the mall

15:41.770 --> 15:44.568
and tweeting photos of shoes
that we wanted.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.430
I know.

15:46.470 --> 15:49.473
But in spite of all that,
she really cared about you.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.502
You were all very precious
to Mona.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.108
You_do realize
there IS more than

15:54.150 --> 15:56.175
one Mona inside of her, right?

15:56.220 --> 15:58.279
That's what
I liked about her.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.015
Most girls
have trouble keeping

16:00.060 --> 16:01.755
two thoughts in their mind
at the same time,

16:01.790 --> 16:06.227
but Mona was thinking
every second.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.997
"And though my heart be broken
here is a ring as a token

16:13.040 --> 16:15.292
that I am happy now.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.365
Would God
I could awaken.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.469
For I dream,
I know not how.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.001
And my soul is
sorely shaken.

16:22.040 --> 16:27.273
Lest the dead who is forsaken
may not be happy now."

16:27.320 --> 16:30.039
Why do you like this stuff?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.739
I love this stuff.

16:31.790 --> 16:35.681
It's like maple syrup,
all sticky and sweet.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.085
And creepy.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.155
It's the creepy part
that makes it fun.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.691
Okay,
you've got three wishes.

16:46.730 --> 16:49.631
What do you want?
And you can't wish
for more wishes.

16:49.670 --> 16:53.276
I don't like wishing games.
They just remind you
of what you don't have.

16:53.310 --> 16:54.629
Oh, you are such a thud.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.329
What's the point
of breaking your shell

16:56.380 --> 16:58.598
if you turn into
such a dull omelet?

16:58.650 --> 17:00.447
You make better wishes aanay.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.710
That's true.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.516
I would wish for a stopwatch.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.381
A stopwatch?

17:08.420 --> 17:10.729
So when you press down
on the stem,

17:10.760 --> 17:14.196
not only does the watch stop,
but all time stops.

17:14.230 --> 17:17.563
Everything freezes
and you can walk around

17:17.600 --> 17:19.625
and take anything you want
from the stores

17:19.670 --> 17:21.262
and go into people's houses,

17:21.300 --> 17:24.337
even when they're there
and spy on them.

17:24.370 --> 17:26.406
You would have
all the control

17:26.440 --> 17:29.409
and nobody would ever know
it was you.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.238
They wouldn't even know
they were being controlled.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.713
That'd be the best part.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.811
Mona was always thinking.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.418
She just wasn't thinking

17:42.460 --> 17:44.121
what we thought
she was thinking.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.198
( gasps )

18:00.680 --> 18:01.829
Thanks.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.218
Don't mention it.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.152
Hey, man.

18:19.190 --> 18:21.727
Hey.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.489
What's that going to be?

18:23.530 --> 18:26.226
It's like a perpetual
motion machine,

18:26.270 --> 18:28.864
powered by secrets.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.299
There's plenty of those
around here.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.103
And so I've noticed.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.888
Oh.
Hey, Mike.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.478
Hi.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.750
Lesli, this is Mike,
Aria's brother.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.428
Oh, Mike,
it's so nice to meet you.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.893
Mona talked about you
all the time.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.852
She's staying
with Mrs. Vanderwaal.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.197
I can see that.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.629
You can?

18:58.670 --> 19:00.228
That belongs to Mona.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.488
I know. _
We were just looking
at it in her room.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.337
In her room?
I know it sounds silly,

19:04.370 --> 19:05.837
I just wanted it with me
for a little while.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.906
Does her mom know
you took that?

19:07.940 --> 19:09.771
Mike, it's not like
we took it.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.244
Is her mom giving away
her stuff now?
Is that what's happening?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.271
No, that's not
what's happening.
Then give me the book.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.811
Mike!
I'm taking it back
to where it belongs.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.655
You can't take
everything apart

19:21.690 --> 19:24.557
like you want her
to disappear.

19:24.590 --> 19:25.682
Hand it over.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.867
Mike, I'll make sure the book
goes back to where it belongs.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.731
Okay?
I promise.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.839
I'm sorry.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.542
Mike and Mona
were pretty serious

19:49.580 --> 19:50.786
before it all happened.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.486
What's the matter?

19:54.520 --> 19:56.681
I don't want to make trouble
for anyone.

19:59.730 --> 20:00.924
The night before
Mona was killed,

20:00.960 --> 20:02.723
we were talking on the phone

20:02.760 --> 20:04.489
and in the middle of it,
someone came up to her

20:04.530 --> 20:06.566
and told her to hang up
and talk to him.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.864
He sounded pretty upset.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.959
I'm pretty sure it was Mike.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.504
She said she would call me back,
but she never did.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.956
Didn't anybody tell you
it was Saturday?

20:30.990 --> 20:33.891
Well, I got to work
on my academic cred.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.522
Because of Hanna?

20:35.560 --> 20:38.597
She keeps surprising you,
doesn't she?

20:38.630 --> 20:40.291
All those hidden smarts.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.968
I don't want to get left
in the dust.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.436
Though I should probably
be focusing on criminal law.

20:47.810 --> 20:50.301
Is it going to make a difference
now that Holbrook is suspended?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.545
Maybe.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.808
Someone like that
can cause a lot of trouble

20:53.850 --> 20:54.919
from the sidelines, too.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.565
How's that _
new Situation gomg?

21:12.930 --> 21:14.795
Still very new.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.277
What's up?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.971
Ali's going on trial
for murder.

21:27.010 --> 21:29.444
She's trying to bring us
all down with her,

21:29.480 --> 21:31.516
and I keep trying to figure out

21:31.550 --> 21:34.678
if a girl is flirting
with me or not.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.457
Well, in the middle
of the war,

21:37.490 --> 21:39.424
you have to remember
what you're fighting for.

21:42.430 --> 21:45.069
What answer
do you want to hear?

21:45.100 --> 21:47.591
Flirting or non-flirting?

21:47.640 --> 21:50.097
I don't know what I want.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.439
I mean, I know what I want.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.405
I just don't know what I want.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.772
Scary thing is,
that makes perfect sense to me.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.312
How does anybody
get together with anybody?

22:05.490 --> 22:09.551
Well, you take a calm,
clear look at everything

22:09.590 --> 22:13.697
and you work it out logically
in your head.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.051
And then,
you flip a coin.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.365
Yeah.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.428
You believe what she said?

22:23.470 --> 22:24.960
Lesli did talk to Mona.

22:25.010 --> 22:25.999
I asked Mrs. V.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.803
She said
Mona mentioned the call.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.432
But it probably
doesn't mean anything.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.742
He's just sad and angry.

22:30.780 --> 22:31.872
Hanna.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.112
Mike_wen_t to visit
Alison in jail.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.117
He did what?

22:36.150 --> 22:37.708
Spencer found out.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.581
Mike got in a fight with Mona
the night before she died

22:39.620 --> 22:41.053
and now he's going to visit
the person who killed her?

22:41.090 --> 22:43.581
Well, it sounds really bad
when you say it like that.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.585
Well, have you
talked to him?

22:44.630 --> 22:45.654
I tried.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.123
But I don't know,

22:47.160 --> 22:48.855
I couldn't get the words
out of my mouth.

22:48.900 --> 22:49.958
Even if you can't talk
to him,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.059
you have to figure out
what's going on.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.835
Pliers.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.807
Are you gonna tell me
what this thing does?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.649
You're smart,
you can figure it out.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.569
I don't want to figure it out.
I just want to know.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.111
Analyze that sentence, Spencer,
it's very revealing.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.109
It's a gelato maker.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.616
That's right,
that's what it is.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.787
Shut up.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.837
Where did you get this?

23:31.040 --> 23:33.133
In the barn.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.673
There are still a couple
of those around town.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.132
You see them
on old telephone poles

23:37.180 --> 23:40.547
with the missing dog
and cat flyers.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.775
They're a little faded,
but you can tell what they are.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.914
Your friend is just about
mythic in this town.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.918
She's not
my friend anymore.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.987
She's still legendary.
Gilgamesh in high heels.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.590
She's more like a Vishnu.

23:54.630 --> 23:57.997
"Now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

23:58.030 --> 24:01.739
Some grim stuff to hang on
a pretty girl with a nice smile.

24:03.970 --> 24:06.564
How do you go from that

24:06.610 --> 24:09.170
to sitting in jail
for killing someone?

24:10.580 --> 24:12.047
It's complicated.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.117
Or else it's simple
and we just thought
that it was complicated.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.812
Phillips-head screwdriver,
please.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.728
Here.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.022
Maybe you shouldn't have
told Aria about Mike.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.824
He's her brother,
she deserves to know.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.531
I just don't want to get him
into any trouble.

24:34.570 --> 24:37.266
Mike will be fine.
He's a good guy.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.063
I hope so.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.702
I'm going to help
Mrs. Vanderwaal with her tea.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.799
Okay,
I'm right behind you.

25:00.860 --> 25:02.293
The stopwatch.

25:02.330 --> 25:05.265
All the time it was stopped,
you'd be getting older,

25:05.300 --> 25:07.860
but nobody else would.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.891
I'd fix that.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.305
Well, how would you
fix it?

25:11.340 --> 25:14.605
Fix it so everyone else
would get old, but not me.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.575
Well, when they notice that
you weren't getting older?

25:17.610 --> 25:18.941
That would be their problem.

25:20.180 --> 25:24.287
Suppose Alison came back
a long time from now,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.140
will we recognize her?

25:26.190 --> 25:27.748
We'd recognize her.

25:27.790 --> 25:30.623
What if she changed her hair
and the way she looked?

25:30.660 --> 25:34.994
What if she wanted
to come back in disguise
just to check up on us?

25:35.030 --> 25:38.818
Even if she did come back,
she wouldn't recognize us.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.861
She'd come back to a town
full of strangers

25:40.900 --> 25:42.265
who'd have forgotten
all about her.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.934
And then she'd go crazy
and they'd throw her
into Radley,

25:46.970 --> 25:49.131
and no one ever gets
out of there.

25:50.610 --> 25:52.009
God, Mona, don't say that.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.719
It's just another
scary story, Hanna.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.012
Like in the book.

26:00.050 --> 26:03.053
Just a story.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.250
Go to sleep.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.039
( rattling )

27:19.770 --> 27:21.863
( door closes )

27:45.290 --> 27:46.655
What do you think?

27:48.060 --> 27:49.049
Is it finished?

27:49.100 --> 27:50.419
Of course it is.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.826
You can't tell?

27:52.870 --> 27:54.292
That's a very sour look.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.228
Be careful, your face
might freeze like that.

27:56.270 --> 27:57.908
Will you finally tell me
what this thing does?

27:57.940 --> 28:00.067
Sit down.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.179
You see these two buttons?

28:01.210 --> 28:04.338
Put your elbows on them,
lean forward.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.348
Now cup your hands
around your ears.
You're kidding.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.847
I never kid.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.370
I'm whimsical,
but I never kid.

28:12.450 --> 28:13.678
Stay there.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.958
This is ridiculous.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.962
The owl and the pussy-cat
went to sea

28:24.000 --> 28:26.969
in a beautiful pea-green boat.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.309
The microphone is attached
to a pair of sound drivers
in the table,

28:31.340 --> 28:33.069
like the inside of a speaker.

28:33.110 --> 28:35.078
Whenever you rest your elbows
on the buttons,

28:35.110 --> 28:38.045
the drivers vibrate the ulna
and the radius in each arm

28:38.080 --> 28:41.277
and the bones in your hands,
turning them into headphones.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.209
You just became
a human tuning fork.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.342
Oh, my God.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.039
What do you think?

28:47.090 --> 28:50.116
It's not bad
for $200, right?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.457
That's incredible!

28:51.490 --> 28:52.422
People turn on
the microphone

28:52.460 --> 28:54.894
and anonymously record
any secret they want to

28:54.930 --> 28:56.818
with the understanding
that someone,

28:56.860 --> 28:58.327
a stranger,
is going to sit at this table

28:58.370 --> 29:00.759
and listen_
to a random whisper.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.358
This is brilliant.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.005
Seriously, this is--
this is genius.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.235
Just some anatomy
and applied engineering--

29:07.270 --> 29:10.103
Jonny.
Yeah, come to think of it,
it is genius.

29:10.140 --> 29:11.368
Yeah.

29:11.410 --> 29:12.775
Where did you come up
with this idea?

29:12.810 --> 29:15.938
I was inspired by Rosewood.
By Rosewood?

29:15.980 --> 29:18.949
This whole town is strung
together with whispers.

29:23.290 --> 29:26.020
If you were really impressed,
you'd buy me coffee.

29:28.860 --> 29:29.997
I thought you said
that Alison cleared

29:30.030 --> 29:31.520
all the Radley material
from Mona's house.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.526
That's what we thought.
But she hid this one.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.435
She didn't keep it
with the others.

29:35.470 --> 29:37.267
Well, let's find out why.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.807
BETHANY: She's a bitch.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.203
THERAPIST:
Let's try to find other words.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.547
BETHANY:
She's an evil bitch.

29:46.580 --> 29:48.047
THERAPIST: Bethany.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.547
BETHANY:
I don't mean nasty or rude.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.219
I mean evil, without a soul.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.286
You could be the nicest person
in the world--

29:54.320 --> 29:56.254
she gets them to do
whatever she wants.

29:56.290 --> 29:59.350
Five minutes with her
you'd drown a bag of kittens
if she asked.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.948
Two minutes,
if you're a man.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.399
THERAPIST: If you're having
destructive thoughts--

30:02.430 --> 30:04.898
BETHANY: Not destructive,
self-defense.

30:04.930 --> 30:08.559
It's me or her.
She's not the only one
who can make plans.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.439
What the hell was that?

30:13.470 --> 30:15.028
That was Bethany.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.207
And she's talking
about Alison, right?

30:20.150 --> 30:21.469
Let's listen
to the whole thing.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.132
Nice night.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.948
Yeah, it's getting
kind of chilly though.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.972
Why'd you follow me
out here?

32:02.020 --> 32:03.510
Why did you
visit Alison in jail?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.381
You did, didn't you?

32:06.420 --> 32:08.058
That's none of your business.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.456
Did you want to confront her
about Mona?

32:10.490 --> 32:12.583
Were you looking for
some kind of closure?

32:14.360 --> 32:16.157
Ali's dangerous, Mike.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.690
Even in a cage,
she's really dangerous.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.459
Don't ever
go back there again.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.037
Nobody is giving me
orders anymore.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.004
You stop following me.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.530
I don't ever want to see you
out here again.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.162
"Again?"

32:27.210 --> 32:29.474
How many times
have you been out here?

32:29.510 --> 32:31.649
How many trick-or-treat bags
have you left?

32:31.680 --> 32:33.307
Who are you leaving those for?

32:35.550 --> 32:38.041
Be careful going home
through the woods.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.131
Hello.

32:55.170 --> 32:57.468
Hello.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.309
Why are you working
in here?

32:59.340 --> 33:00.659
You could just
use the den.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.735
Hmm, that was your
father's space.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.101
I don't feel comfortable
working in there.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.617
Where were you?

33:12.720 --> 33:15.655
Um, I was just helping out
Jonny at the Brew.

33:15.690 --> 33:18.079
I'm starting to have
second thoughts about him.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.327
Don't.
I really like the way
his mind works.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.588
I hate to see young people

33:22.630 --> 33:24.621
like that squander
their potential.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.797
I don't really think
Jonny sees it that way.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.630
Talking to him, is that
what has you thinking about
not going to college?

33:30.670 --> 33:36.370
Mom, I'm not not thinking
about going to college, okay?

33:36.410 --> 33:37.638
I'm just thinking.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.148
Spencer,
your future won't wait.

33:40.180 --> 33:42.614
Do you remember
what you wanted to do

33:42.650 --> 33:44.208
with your life
when you were my age?

33:46.120 --> 33:49.351
And don't say,
"be a lawyer."

33:50.720 --> 33:52.824
I did not want
to be a lawyer.

33:52.860 --> 33:56.125
Then please,
just do me a favor

33:56.160 --> 33:58.492
and try for, like,
10 seconds,

33:58.530 --> 34:02.569
just try to remember
what that felt like.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.679
( cell phone rings )

34:13.310 --> 34:14.413
Yes, Ralph.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.215
Spencer, wait.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.808
Yeah.
It'll have an impact.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.283
I just don't know what.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.356
Okay.

34:23.390 --> 34:25.324
Thank you.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.249
There's been a leak
from the prosecutor's office.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.790
What kind of leak?

34:30.830 --> 34:32.559
They're still analyzing
the contents of the barrel

34:32.600 --> 34:33.726
from the storage space,

34:33.770 --> 34:35.567
but they have a match
on the blood spots.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.158
Mona's blood?

34:37.200 --> 34:39.236
No.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.567
Alison's.

34:43.480 --> 34:46.074
( music playing on car stereo )

34:48.220 --> 34:50.313
( siren whoops )

34:50.350 --> 34:52.580
( sighs )

34:52.620 --> 34:54.781
* Walk on the sun
and beat your own drum *

34:54.820 --> 34:57.380
* If you got something to say

34:57.420 --> 34:59.320
* You got to shout,
you got to yell *

34:59.360 --> 35:02.193
* If you got something to say

35:02.230 --> 35:04.391
* Take what you want
and get what you need *

35:04.430 --> 35:06.796
* And run away with it all

35:06.830 --> 35:08.832
* Out with the old
and in With the new *

35:08.870 --> 35:11.862
* You're gonna break down
every wall *

35:11.910 --> 35:15.607
* The party's on
and we've waited long enough *

35:15.640 --> 35:17.176
* Won't you come on

35:17.210 --> 35:20.407
* Put your hands up

35:20.450 --> 35:22.418
* Put your hands up

35:22.450 --> 35:26.910
* Are you a rebel?
Are you a rebel? *

35:26.950 --> 35:29.418
* Show them
your hip shake *

35:29.460 --> 35:31.883
* Show them the rules
are meant to break *

35:31.930 --> 35:36.458
* Are you a rebel?
Are you a rebel? *

35:36.500 --> 35:38.388
* Are you a rebel?

35:43.900 --> 35:45.504
Hello, Hanna.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.633
( panting )

35:47.670 --> 35:49.228
They suspended you.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.508
Why do you have this car?

35:50.540 --> 35:52.940
I haven't gotten around
to turning it in.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.210
You're gonna report me?

35:55.250 --> 35:56.877
I might get in trouble
for that.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.410
Let go of me.
Now!

35:58.450 --> 36:00.315
I just want to ask you
a question first.

36:00.350 --> 36:05.219
How does a girl like Alison
become a girl like Alison?

36:05.260 --> 36:08.195
She's had years of practice.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.755
I had a career.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.620
The start of one.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.661
I don't have that anymore.

36:14.700 --> 36:18.739
I'm finished because of her.

36:18.770 --> 36:20.761
You could have said no.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.903
You didn't have to do
all of her dirty work,

36:22.940 --> 36:24.703
cleaning out all that junk
in the storage space,

36:24.750 --> 36:27.275
trying to kill Spencer,
Aria and Caleb.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.814
No, you're getting me mixed up
with the wrong fall guy.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.785
I spent the last few weeks
locked up in a hotel

36:33.820 --> 36:36.288
with a couple of old-timers
from Internal Affairs.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.550
You don't believe me?

36:38.590 --> 36:39.659
Ask Tanner.

36:39.690 --> 36:41.692
Tanner knows everything.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.288
Wait a minute.

36:43.330 --> 36:45.389
She cut me off.

36:45.430 --> 36:46.522
VVhen?

36:46.570 --> 36:49.892
Did Alison tell you
to kiss me?

36:51.770 --> 36:54.273
Oh, she did, didn't she?

36:56.740 --> 36:57.832
Ohhh!

36:57.880 --> 36:59.643
You don't get to play
the victim here.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.444
You're the grown-up
police officer.
She's just a girl.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.883
If All really did cut you off,
congratulations.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.616
You don't know
how luclq you are.

37:09.660 --> 37:13.778
* Put your hands up,
put your hands up *

37:13.830 --> 37:18.597
* Are you a rebel?
Are you a rebel? *

37:18.630 --> 37:21.337
* Show them
your hip shake *

37:21.370 --> 37:23.463
* Show them the rules
are meant to break *

37:23.500 --> 37:27.869
* Are you a rebel?
Are you a rebel? *

37:27.910 --> 37:32.472
* Are you a rebel?
Are you a rebel? *

37:44.060 --> 37:46.688
I thought you left.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.824
I was just looking at this.

37:49.860 --> 37:53.296
Do you know
what it's supposed to do?

37:55.600 --> 37:59.536
Jonny said it was about
catching whispers.

37:59.570 --> 38:03.028
I wonder how it works.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.377
He told me.

38:04.410 --> 38:06.071
I can show you?

38:06.110 --> 38:08.613
Yes.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.277
Okay.
Sit down.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.554
Put your elbows here.

38:17.590 --> 38:21.026
Lean forward and cup your ears
with your hands.

38:21.060 --> 38:24.291
Okay, stay like that.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.062
( clears throat )

38:35.580 --> 38:36.899
It works like this.

38:38.010 --> 38:40.843
I say something in here...

38:40.880 --> 38:44.941
and it travels
up the bones in your arms

38:44.990 --> 38:46.617
and into your ears.

38:46.650 --> 38:50.780
Like I was right next to you,
whispering.

38:54.430 --> 38:58.366
I should have said something
that night, but I didn't.

39:00.430 --> 39:05.663
I guess I was surprised.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.134
I've been thinking about it
ever since,

39:09.180 --> 39:11.375
about what you said.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.611
It's like you were asking me
to decide something right then

39:17.650 --> 39:20.414
and I couldn't do that.

39:20.450 --> 39:24.853
I mean, you don't know
anything about me, really.

39:24.890 --> 39:28.792
And I don't know
anything about you.

39:28.830 --> 39:31.560
Except, I know you're good
at what you do.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.966
Really gifted.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.630
I know that sometimes
that makes things lonely.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.399
I know what that's like.

39:42.010 --> 39:44.945
To be alone.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.675
To be lonely.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.088
Maybe I read too much
into situations

40:07.130 --> 40:08.859
and what people say.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.629
I don't think so.

40:10.670 --> 40:15.801
I think you're a very good judge
of a situation.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.774
So the other night...

40:17.810 --> 40:22.645
The other night,
it took all the courage I had

40:22.680 --> 40:23.977
to say what I said.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.688
I don't believe that.

40:28.620 --> 40:29.985
A chef once told me

40:30.020 --> 40:33.478
to cook with the confidence
of experience,

40:33.530 --> 40:36.055
even if you don't have
much of either.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.201
It's late.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.218
Where's Emily?
I don't know.

41:05.260 --> 41:06.955
Her phone's still going
straight to voicemail.

41:06.990 --> 41:07.979
Are you sure about this?

41:08.030 --> 41:09.099
You guys,
Holbrook doesn't know

41:09.130 --> 41:10.757
half the stuff
we thought he did.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.495
We've been barking up
the wrong henchman.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.225
So somebody else has
been helping Ali.

41:14.270 --> 41:15.760
Yes, somebody we don't know.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.791
Or somebody
we'd never suspect.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.700
Aria, we all know
what Ali's capable of.

41:22.740 --> 41:24.230
Yeah, okay,
and I know my own brother.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.579
He went to see her in jail
and he won't tell you why.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.111
And what if he goes back?

41:29.150 --> 41:31.038
What if he's the way that
she's still moving stuff around?

41:31.080 --> 41:32.047
He's not gonna go back.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.148
How can you be sure?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.782
Because I told him not to.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.580
The stuff that Bethany
was saying on the tape

41:38.630 --> 41:40.928
about other people making plans,
what does that mean?

41:40.960 --> 41:44.020
It means that what happened
in Ali's baclqard was a trap.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.766
Okay, but who set
the trap for who?

41:55.580 --> 41:56.831
BETHANY: She's a bitch.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.302
THERAPIST:
Let's try to find other words.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.671
BETHANY:
She's an evil bitch.

41:59.710 --> 42:00.802
THERAPIST: Bethany.

42:00.850 --> 42:02.169
BETHANY:
I don't mean nasty or rude.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.745
I mean evil, without a soul.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.542
You could be the nicest person
in the world--

42:06.590 --> 42:08.319
she gets them to do
whatever she wants.

42:08.350 --> 42:11.114
Five minutes with her,
you'd drown a bag of kittens
if she asked.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.718
Two minutes, if you're a man.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.284
THERAPIST: If you're having
destructive thoughts--

42:14.330 --> 42:16.651
BETHANY:
Not destructive, self-defense.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.659
It's me or her.
She's not the only one
who can make plans.
