WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:05.161
Guys, this is the best
laundry party I've ever thrown.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.830
You can't just stick the word
"party" on anything and make it fun.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.670
You're just mad because you
missed Brad's gum surgery party.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.130
(BRAD AND JANE LAUGH)

00:12.429 --> 00:13.635
Well, save the date,
because next week

00:13.931 --> 00:15.763
I'm having
an asymmetrical mole removed.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.765
The theme will either be
"Dressed to the benigns"

00:18.060 --> 00:20.017
or "It's time to get my
affairs in order." Hmm.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.804
(PLASTIC RUSTLES) Ooh!
That's a lot of laundry, buddy.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.813
Actually, this is all candy. Oh.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.690
Yeah. I trick-or-treated
my way over here.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.100
It's not even close
to Halloween.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.985
Yeah, but it turns out if
you ring someone's doorbell

00:30.280 --> 00:32.442
and then scream in their face
"Trick or treat?" as loud as you can,

00:32.741 --> 00:34.231
they'll just give you
whatever they have on them.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.492
This one guy, he
gave me all his laundry.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.198
Hmm? And the cool
thing is that it's all XXL,

00:38.497 --> 00:40.113
so I have room
to grow into it.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.746
You're a terrifying
individual.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.908
Oh, hey, Dave, you wanna
throw your shirts in with mine?

00:44.211 --> 00:47.078
Oh, no, no, no. These...
These require special attention.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.123
In fact, sometimes I throw them on wet
and run-dry them so they keep their shape.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.211
But then I get all sweaty,
and it's like, here we go again!

00:52.511 --> 00:53.967
Would not change a thing
about what you're doing.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.924
(WHISPERS) Thank you.
ALEX: Oh, my God.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.760
There's a groupon at the
aquarium to swim with the dolphins.

00:59.059 --> 00:59.924
Mama likes dolphins.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.683
Nope. (SIGHS)
Hey!

01:01.979 --> 01:03.219
(BEEP)
Mama always does this.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.012
You see something you like,
you buy it,

01:05.315 --> 01:06.805
and then you lose interest
immediately. You're too impulsive.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.645
| am not too impulsive.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.185
You bought us
a timeshare in Tampa.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.570
The lady at the kiosk said
it's the Sacramento of the east.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.355
Now we gotta go to Tampa
every year.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.820
Tampa's not a place
that you go.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.359
It's a place
that you end up.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.199
(CHUCKLES) My bitch
is the same way. What?

01:21.498 --> 01:24.240
Brad buys so much junk on
QVC, we could start our own show.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.705
(GASPS)
But we won't.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.666
Whatever, Jane.
It's not junk, all right?

01:29.965 --> 01:32.297
For example, while you
porkers have been doing laundry,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.005
I've been sitting here, getting a
killer ab workout with my new...

01:35.304 --> 01:37.466
Electro Ab Belt.
(CHUCKLES)

01:37.764 --> 01:39.095
The electro-pulse
stimulation...

01:39.391 --> 01:40.802
(ELECTRICITY PULSES)
Uhh! Tones and shapes your...

01:41.101 --> 01:41.806

01:42.102 --> 01:43.342
(GRUNTS)
Huh?

01:43.645 --> 01:44.726
(NORMAL VOICE)
For improved muscle defi...

01:47.149 --> 01:48.480
(BUZZING STOPS)
(GRUNTS)

01:48.775 --> 01:50.812
Anyway...

01:51.111 --> 01:53.193
| predict that Alex buys the
groupon and never uses it.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.195
| am absolutely
gonna use it.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.572
Okay, how many unredeemed
groupons do you have currently?

01:57.868 --> 01:58.858
(MUTTERS)
BRAD AND DAVE: What?

01:59.161 --> 02:00.401
Hmm? (MUTTERS)

02:00.704 --> 02:02.194
How many?
Eleven.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.034
Eleven. Okay. Well, I think it's
time that you learned a lesson.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.291
Tell you what. If you use all
your groupons in one week,

02:07.586 --> 02:09.452
I'll buy you that
dolphin groupon and

02:09.755 --> 02:10.620
I'll do it with ya.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.458
You're on, ping-pong.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.920
Mmm. Okay.
Well, good luck, Alex.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.504
(ELECTRICITY PULSES) I'm
(STRAINED VOICE) rooting for you.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.668
Okay? You all right?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.803
What I meant to say is,
I'm In your...

02:20.098 --> 02:20.883
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)
(STRAINED VOICE) ...corner.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.969
(VOICE BREAKS)
Ow! Oh, God!

02:23.268 --> 02:23.928
It's just... It's not
even pulsing anymore.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.467
(ZAPS)
Oow!

02:25.771 --> 02:26.306
Get that off of him.
It's just constant.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.686
| don't...
Ow!

02:27.981 --> 02:28.971
So painful!
It shocked me!

02:29.274 --> 02:30.355
Take it off! All right. I'm
trying. | don't know where...

02:30.651 --> 02:32.233
Ohh.
(BUZZING STOPS)

02:32.527 --> 02:33.858
| need to sit on a trash bag.
We need a trash bag. We just...

02:34.154 --> 02:35.440
ALEX: No! It's
happens. It just happens.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.103
(GROANS)
It's okay. It's okay.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.209
Last time I was there, |
think I left a suede jacket.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.620
I'd love to get that back,
with or without the cat.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.665
Oh, PS. There's a live cat
living in that jacket.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.048
(SPLAT)
Oh, my God.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.129
| see the guy
whose life I ruined,

02:58.428 --> 03:00.965
who in turn
vowed to ruin mine.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.095
If you find my coat cat, he
answers to the name "Coat Cat."

03:02.391 --> 03:03.222
Gotta go. Bye!

03:03.517 --> 03:05.349
Hey, Chase.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.760
Buddy, old pal.
You know what's cool?

03:08.063 --> 03:09.053
The last time
we saw each other,

03:09.356 --> 03:11.063
we left things
on the best terms possible.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.687
I've been looking
for you, Max.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.191
To tell me that
you're back at work

03:15.487 --> 03:16.602
and that you're back
with your wife?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.521
Nope. Thanks to you,
I'm still unemployed,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.485
and my ex-wife's engaged
to my brother.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.274
(GROANS AND EXHALES)
I'd kill myself,

03:22.577 --> 03:23.908
but guess who has to give
a toast at their wedding?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.287
Ooh, boy. That is rough'em
stuff em robots, pal.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.164
I've been following you
for weeks,

03:29.459 --> 03:30.870
trying to craft a plan
to ruin your life.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.910
Funny thing is,
your life is so pathetic

03:33.213 --> 03:34.248
| doubt I can
make it any worse.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.209
It's un-sabotagable.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.216
Hey. Come on. | got
a lot of stuff going on.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.422
[, uh, recently
bought a ladle...

03:41.722 --> 03:43.588
For soups.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.473
[, uh... | read half
an article on fish oil.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.009
And, uh, I just learned
how to do the Heimlich.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.269
Can even do it on myself, so now
chewing food is my prerogative.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.981
Your life sucks.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.482
You have no job,
no love life.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.017
Your apartment
is disgusting.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.731
| considered releasing
rats in there,

03:59.030 --> 04:00.395
but you already had rats in
there way bigger than mine.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.734
Don't beat yourself up, pal.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.990
We're all just raising
our rats the best we can.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.869
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm not gonna ruin your life

04:07.164 --> 04:09.952
because it's impossible to ruin
something that's already terrible.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.581
It'd be like adding more moms
to Facebook.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.629
Penny, aren't you sick of
paying a professional ear cleaner

04:17.923 --> 04:19.209
to come to your house

04:19.509 --> 04:21.966
and painfully remove
your unwanted canal wax?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.923
Look, Brad, I know Jane's making
you sell all your little gadgets, but...

04:24.222 --> 04:25.303
Well, now you
don't have to...

04:25.599 --> 04:28.512
With the revolutionary
Ear Genie. Try it out.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.550
(WHIRRING)
No!

04:29.853 --> 04:30.934
What?
(WHIRRING STOPS)

04:31.229 --> 04:33.345
No, I do not wanna buy
your used ear cleaner.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.854
Totally understand.
| get it.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.390
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Let's talk shoes.

How are you
heating yours?

04:38.487 --> 04:39.477

| need help!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.521
| have a problem and
I need help. No! Me!

04:41.823 --> 04:43.279
Okay, okay. Alex
first. Alex first.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.407
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.692
So you know how Dave challenged
me to do all these groupons?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.656
| keep getting distracted.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.036
| didn't even make it to my
pottery class this morning.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.412

04:54.711 --> 04:56.327
(PUPPIES BARKING
AND YIPPING)

04:58.089 --> 05:00.126
Ohh! It was
a total puppy pile-on.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.665
So you never used
your pottery groupon?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.426
Which means you
still have 11. Twelve.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.961
The puppy store lady said
that there was a groupon

05:06.264 --> 05:07.925
for eyelash extensions.
| need those!

05:08.225 --> 05:10.557
| have my dad's
stubby eyelashes.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.342
You guys have to do
these groupons with me,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.353
keep me on track.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.389
Well, as the author of
several dozen cries for help,

05:16.691 --> 05:17.601
| know a good one
when I hear one.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.391
But we have to be fair.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.401
In the interest of
conducting a civil discourse,

05:21.696 --> 05:23.858
the fat slob from Illinois
has the floor.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.194
Thank you. Now you guys
remember Chase, right?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.450
Oh, yeah. Yes. Super cool
guy, vowed to ruin your life.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.157
That's the one. Well, he
said that my life is so pathetic

05:31.456 --> 05:33.367
that it is un-sabotagable.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.453
So I need to improve my life
to prove him wrong.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.242
Hmm.
(CLICKING TONGUE)

05:37.546 --> 05:39.036
BRAD: (CLICKS TONGUE) Huh.
PENNY: Hmm.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.580
Well, Max...

05:41.883 --> 05:42.873
You know we love a
challenge. Mmm-hmm.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.632
But that's not
so much a challenge

05:44.928 --> 05:46.384
as it is a suicide mission.
So we're gonna go with Alex!

05:46.680 --> 05:47.841
Yes!

with Tom Hanks.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.760
Max, there's only one person

05:55.063 --> 05:57.680
who's really
up to this challenge.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.270
I've waited 10 years for you to
come to me. (INHALES DEEPLY)

of me in my underwear?

Well, you're... You're
always in your underwear.

that need improvements.

all of them.

Yeah. You got
lots of bad areas.

of gay guys.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.967
Okay. Well,
where do we start?

06:31.266 --> 06:33.132
Small stuff.
Haircut, shower,

06:33.435 --> 06:35.142

food could be "lasagna'd."

undiagnosed OCD hands.

you "Doubting Dolphin Dave."

07:57.978 --> 08:00.094
Ooh! Yay!

08:00.397 --> 08:02.138
| hate tequila.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.147
These groupons are
the worst thing ever.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.978
No, the worst thing ever
is that at this rate,

08:06.277 --> 08:09.065
Alex is gonna finish
these groupons by tomorrow.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.525
You know what
we need to do?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.485
We need to sabotage her
so she can't finish.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.024
Why would I do that?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.159
Because, Pen,
if Alex wins this,

08:16.454 --> 08:18.946
she's gonna be dragging you to
groupons for the rest of your life.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.240
You wanna be 50 years old
and single

08:21.543 --> 08:23.534
and doing half-priced
trapeze lessons?

08:23.837 --> 08:26.670
| resent you making me
single in this hypothetical.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.797
See, you could've at least given me
the dignity of having been widowed.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.423
Okay! Down the hatch.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.426
Our brow-shaping groupon
is in 10.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.881
They shoot a laser right
between your eyeballs!

08:34.179 --> 08:35.419
(CHUCKLES)
Here. Ready, Pen?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.635
Yes! Whoo!
Whoo!

08:37.933 --> 08:38.799
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

08:39.102 --> 08:40.433
Mmm!
Ugh!

08:40.729 --> 08:41.639
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Let's take that bitch down.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.769
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

08:43.063 --> 08:43.929
(WHIRRING)

08:48.570 --> 08:50.060
Jane!
(TURNS OFF VACUUM)

08:50.363 --> 08:51.649
Check out this machine.
It's amazing.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.564
It sucks the garbage
off the ground,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.073
so now I don't have to
throw it out on the street

08:55.368 --> 08:56.654
through a hole in my pocket,
Andy Dufresne style.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.365
Max, you look great.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.904
| mean, really great.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.572
| feel great.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.661
This morning,
| flossed my mouth,

09:03.960 --> 09:05.325
and my gums
only bled a lot,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.210
as opposed to
an alarming amount.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.291
And you had that interview
today at that grocery store?

09:09.591 --> 09:10.581
How did that go?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.420
(THUD)
| nailed it.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.551
This supermarket
is the worst.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.007
Here's what you gotta do.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.341
You gotta move
the sugar cereals

09:17.640 --> 09:19.506
from the bottom shelf
to the top shelf,

09:19.809 --> 09:23.097
'cause people like me don't
and/or can't bend over to pick it up.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.852
| thought you were here
for the bagger position?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.480
| said, any questions?
Chop-chop!

09:27.776 --> 09:28.686
| thought you said
you nailed it.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.475
| did nail it, Jane.
In fact,

09:31.738 --> 09:33.604
they're making me

09:33.907 --> 09:34.988
assistant manager.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.739
No way.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.742
Curds and whey.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.573
Guy said he liked my
real talk and fresh takes.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.580
Wow. My plan is working
much faster than I thought.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.161
Come to think of it...

09:47.170 --> 09:48.911
Maybe a little too fast?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.955
| mean, I'm weirdly happy.
My nipples stopped burning.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.873
No one likes my real talk
and fresh takes.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.338
Once, a guy liked
my real fresh take on talks,

09:55.637 --> 09:56.672
and that guy was me,
and I was lying.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.461
What is your point?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.301
There's no way my life could've
turned around this quickly on my own.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.466
The only logical explanation

10:02.769 --> 10:05.557
is that Chase is secretly
trying to improve it,

10:05.855 --> 10:07.846
building me up
only to knock me down.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.060
That is crazy.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.852
Just relax
and enjoy your progress.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.519
Enjoy the progress, huh?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.776
That's exactly what
Chase would say!

10:18.076 --> 10:19.908
What? Ah! Show yourself,
you beautiful genius!

10:20.203 --> 10:21.113
Max!
I'll tear this face off!

10:21.412 --> 10:22.277
Al righty.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.366
Max, I'm not Chase!

10:25.542 --> 10:27.579
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
My bad, Jane.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.709
Full disclosh, though?
Yeah?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.335
Not the first time
| thought you were a dude.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.213
Aw. Thank you.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.165
(CLATTERING)

10:35.468 --> 10:37.300
5 Oh!
kay. (SIGHS)

10:37.595 --> 10:40.713
Today is the last day that Alex's
dolphin groupon is available.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.131
All we have to do is make sure
she doesn't finish the others.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.641
Exactly.
So you, Alex, and Brad

10:45.937 --> 10:47.519
are supposed to go to dinner
tonight at that new barbecue joint,

10:47.814 --> 10:48.929
except you're not because
you and | are gonna...

10:49.232 --> 10:50.688
Throw the phones
through the window,

10:50.984 --> 10:54.352
covering their pulled pork with
shattered glass and phones.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.565
What? No. No, we're gonna call
and make SO many reservations

10:56.865 --> 10:58.526
that you guys
can't get in.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.236
But you are overlooking
one very obvious detail.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.401
The restaurant is gonna
recognize our number.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.991
That's why I got
all these burners, baby.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.624
To throw at the reservation
guy to distract him. Yes!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.955
No! No! You fool, no!
Oh.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.713
We call from
using 40 different personas.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.419
Here are yours.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.208
Uh, southern lawyer?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.091
(IMITATES SOUTHERN ACCENT)
"| do declare.”

11:19.387 --> 11:20.297
Nantucket housewife?

11:20.597 --> 11:21.803
"Uh, white wine spritzer,
please?"

11:22.098 --> 11:23.805
Julian Assange?
Is that the WikiLeaks guy?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.091
| can't do him.
You want me to do him?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.182
Whatever. Just honor
the spirit of the characters.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.346
But don't forget to
have fun out there, okay?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.686
Now your first character
is Alex.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.818
Call the restaurant as her and cancel
the reservation. (WHISPERS) Okay.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.103
(WHINES) Oh, I don't
know if I can do this.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.441
(WHISPERS) You got this.
You got this.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.573
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Hey, I'm Alex Kerkovich.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.825
I'm short
and I love ribs.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.361
Do you know anything about
Alex or how reservations work?

11:46.664 --> 11:47.404
(LOWERED VOICE) This
is what she sounds like!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.414
(IN DEEP VOICE) | need
to cancel a reservation.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.700
Uh... Fantastic.
Thank you.

11:52.003 --> 11:52.743
(BEEP) (NORMAL
VOICE) We're screwed.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.502
She has been there already

11:54.797 --> 11:57.880
and used all three
ribs groupons herself.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.132
God, we should've known.
Breakfast ribs are her favorite.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.088
Damn, damn, damn!

12:01.387 --> 12:04.220
Wait. Why do you care
so much? It's just a bet.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.598
Because I care about Alex,
and I'm trying to help her grow up

12:07.894 --> 12:08.850
and be more responsible
with her money.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.057
What's the real reason?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.688
| have a paralyzing fear
of dolphins.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.769
As in,
when I'm near them

12:16.069 --> 12:16.604
| lose my poop.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.311
Now, come on. There's
only one groupon left,

12:20.615 --> 12:22.481
and it's the military
obstacle course

12:22.784 --> 12:23.865
at the Major Fitness Boot
Camp. (WHISPERS) Okay.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.571
If she does this, I lose,
all right?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.861
So we gotta stop her.
Okay.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.371
Why dolphins?
They seem so sweet.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.783
Let's just say they
understand a lot of things,

12:33.086 --> 12:34.497
but "no" isn't
one of them.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.661

12:37.340 --> 12:38.626
Hey, Max.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.716

Great.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.002
Actually, too great.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.421
This morning, I got approved for a
credit card, my teeth stopped burning.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.089
There's no way Chase
is not behind all this.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.430
Max, that is just
normal stuff

12:50.728 --> 12:52.435
that happens to pretty much everyone
every day. (WOMAN GASPING)

12:52.730 --> 12:53.686

Do I have to do everything?

Okay, ready? Here we
go. Heimlich on three.

Wow.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.651
Great!
No, it's not.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.946
Chase knows that
I've been learning CPR.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.330
(GROANS) He is behind
everything that's happening.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.241
It's a coincidence.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.455
Thank you so much.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.461
I'm a reporter
for WLS Chicago,

13:18.756 --> 13:20.372
and you've gotta let me
do a story about you.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.460
You're a real hero.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.627
Yeah, it's Chase.
Yeah, it's Chase.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.927
(LOUDLY) Welcome to
the Major Fitness Boot Camp!

13:33.229 --> 13:34.811
We have a groupon to use
the military obstacle course.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.221
Yep. Can't wait.
Let's do this.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.310
Sorry, it's closed!
Oh.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.727
The course is flooded.
It's super yucky, ma'am.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.863
Welp, I guess the only obstacle left
for us to overcome is disappointment.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.523
That's it?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.863

I'm sorry!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.573
Do you have to yell
everything?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.237
I'm yelling on account
of my injury!

13:52.540 --> 13:54.907
Of course. You lost
your hearing in combat.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.620
Well, we appreciate
the sacrifice you've made

Penny told me you didn't
finish the obstacle course.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.941
So it looks like instead of
swimming in a tank with dolphins,

14:22.236 --> 14:23.943
I'll be soaking in our tub

14:24.238 --> 14:26.024

Really? The cotton candy maker | bought
on the way home might disagree with you.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.251
It doesn't actually talk.
Those were, like, $200 more.

yourself up over it.

on the wrong side of moist.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.816
(LAUGHS)
That is ridiculous.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.356
At times, you're
woefully unprepared.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.444
Uhh!
Ohh!

16:35.077 --> 16:35.737
Oh!

16:37.997 --> 16:39.863
(THUD)
(SIGHS)

16:40.166 --> 16:41.497
This is the first time I've ever
been attracted to a woman.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.953
(SNIFFS)

16:43.252 --> 16:44.037
| wanna put
a baby in you.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.955
So what'd you guys do,
bring me here to gloat?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.169
(SIGHS) Alex,

16:51.469 --> 16:53.255
| have a confession to make.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.010
Penny and I engaged in
the French art of sabotage.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.967
(GASPS)

16:57.266 --> 16:58.722
We flooded the course
so you couldn't do it. What?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.053
| can't believe you guys.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.560
| didn't want a laser
shot at my eyes.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.516
| don't think that's
an unreasonable position.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.977
But then, Alex, | saw you
with that cotton candy machine,

17:07.276 --> 17:08.983
and I realized that I love
that you're impulsive

17:09.278 --> 17:10.894
and you do those
kinds of things.

17:11.196 --> 17:11.936
That's what
makes you, you.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.151
Aw! Yeah, it is.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.156
It's great. We really
complement each other.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.613
| mean,
you're the impulsive one,

17:17.912 --> 17:19.242
and I'm the grounded one
that thinks things through.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.994
No. No. No, no, no, no.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.872
You're not grounded in the
least. No. No. (CHUCKLES) No!

17:23.166 --> 17:24.077
Super impulsive.
No. Yes.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.913
How am I impulsive?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.623
When you saw Munich,
you tried to get bar mitzvah'd.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.504
You bought a timeshare
in Tampa next to Alex's.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.834
You bought
40 burner cell phones

17:31.133 --> 17:32.749
to make 40 untraceable
dinner reservations.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.213
You have the facial
hair you have. Eh!

17:34.512 --> 17:36.423
Okay, I get it!
| get it.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.008
Leave the goatee
out of it.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.263
It's hard to leave
it out. Really hard.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.640
You know what?
(SIGHS)

17:40.935 --> 17:43.017
Maybe two impulsive people
can work in a relationship.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.848
Hey, it works
for Ice and Coco T.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.683
Sure as hell does.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.144
Here's the dolphin groupon.
(GASPS)

17:48.442 --> 17:49.728
But before
| give it to you,

17:50.027 --> 17:50.858
you have to do
the obstacle course.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.109
But it's closed.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.691
So let's be impulsive.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.113
Hmm.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.274
(LAUGHS)

17:58.578 --> 17:59.989
(HEROIC FANFARE PLAYING)

18:09.672 --> 18:11.003
(INAUDIBLE)

18:17.930 --> 18:19.762
Aah! Uhh.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.675
Uhh!

18:27.023 --> 18:27.808
Aah!

18:31.485 --> 18:32.896
Perhaps there's a downside

18:33.195 --> 18:35.277
to having two impulsive
people in a relationship.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.564
Someone should warn
Ice and Coco T.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.154
| don't think you guys should
be left alone without supervision.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.195
Yeah, it's like all of a sudden we're
parents to two 30-year-old dum-dums.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.202
MAX: Three.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.456
Max, again,
| am so, so sorry.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.413
It's okay.
You did good, baby.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.373
Chase can't
hurt us anymore.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.537
CHASE:
Max, is that you?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.253
MAX: Chase?

18:57.511 --> 18:58.592
What are you doing here?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.378
After we spoke
on the street,

19:00.681 --> 19:01.967
| slipped on that slice of pizza
you dropped and I hit my head.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.432
I've been unconscious
for three days.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.139
Unconscious?

19:07.438 --> 19:09.099
So then it couldn't have
been you building my life up

19:09.398 --> 19:10.854
only to knock it down.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

19:11.150 --> 19:12.891
First of all, I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.400
(WHISPERS) I didn't ask.
Secondly, no, I wasn't.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.901
But I'm so glad you're here

19:16.197 --> 19:17.938
because I wanna
tell you something.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.356
| don't know where you fall
in the existence of an afterlife,

19:20.660 --> 19:24.528
but I'm here to tell you
there is another place.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.071
It's a spiritual realm ruled by
powerful yet merciful beings.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.953
| was there, Max,

19:30.252 --> 19:32.334
and I was headed
for sweet eternal peace.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.875
But then I realized

19:36.175 --> 19:38.337
| could not transcend to the
next plane until I took care

19:38.636 --> 19:41.003
of the unfinished business
of this world...

19:41.305 --> 19:43.421
The unfinished business
of ruining your life.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.969
It was you.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.010
| came back for you.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.645
| have looked deep into
the abyss of the next world,

19:51.941 --> 19:53.181
and it is beautiful.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.100
But before I make
that pilgrimage,

19:55.403 --> 19:58.111
| will stop at nothing
to lay waste

19:58.406 --> 20:00.317
to what you
so tragically call

20:00.616 --> 20:01.606
your life.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.615
Wow.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.369
That guy is still so cool.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.705
That was perfectly timed
with his exit.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.085
Do you think he rehearsed
that with the nurses beforehand?

20:15.381 --> 20:16.871
You know, Max,
the good news is

20:17.174 --> 20:18.539
that now we know you have
the ability to improve your life

20:18.843 --> 20:20.174
all by yourself.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.676
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.178
And I would be more
than happy to help you.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.713
Because if you put
your mind to it,

20:26.016 --> 20:27.256
you could achieve things
you only dreamed of.

20:29.145 --> 20:29.885
So what do you say?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.476
It sounds like a lot
of work. Hard pass.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.106
(VOICE BREAKS) Yeah,
that's okay. | understand.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.267
Well, I gotta go, buddy.
Take care. Bye, everybody.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.235
Ugh. I got passed up for
another promotion at work.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.067
| really need to change
some things in my life.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.945
(SQUEALS)

20:49.248 --> 20:50.409
(WHIRS)

20:50.708 --> 20:51.698
You know,
on second thought,

20:52.001 --> 20:53.412
why should I even
doubt myself?

20:53.711 --> 20:55.702
| mean, I don't even want
that job anyways. (WHIRS)

20:56.630 --> 20:58.871
Yeah. Yeah.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.337
So, Alex, are you going to that
dolphin thing with Dave today?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.460
Oh, no.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.846
(DOLPHIN CHIRPING) |
can do this. | can do this.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.302
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

21:08.601 --> 21:10.057
(CHIRPS AND SQUEAKS)
Oh, no. No way.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.806
| know what
you guys want,

21:13.105 --> 21:14.186
and you're not getting it!
