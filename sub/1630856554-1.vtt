WEBVTT

01:34.715 --> 01:37.373
Dr. Goldstein,
Rover 7 made it back

01:37.373 --> 01:39.616
to the surface, it seems
to be working.

01:39.616 --> 01:41.963
Everything's been recorded.

01:43.758 --> 01:46.209
It can't be left alone.

02:22.211 --> 02:23.557
We found them.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.613
Ah, Mr. Peters,

02:45.613 --> 02:47.374
there's someone waiting
for you in your office.

02:47.374 --> 02:48.409
Waiting for me?

02:53.242 --> 02:54.553
James Peters?

02:54.553 --> 02:56.210
I'm sorry, do I know you?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.108
I'm Dr. Julia Goldstein.

02:58.108 --> 03:00.110
I work for the
Pickman Corporation.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.771
It's inspiring to see
you've been following

03:05.771 --> 03:07.463
in your father's footsteps.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.292
A researcher.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.122
Must be in the blood.

03:12.122 --> 03:13.607
I'm sorry, but I'm
not interested

03:13.607 --> 03:16.610
in any more talks or
lectures about my dad.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.577
I've written just about
everything there is to know,

03:18.577 --> 03:22.167
so buy my books, I do my
own research now.

03:23.272 --> 03:24.238
I know.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.621
The Miskatonic
astrobiology program,

03:27.621 --> 03:29.761
partially funded by us.

03:31.072 --> 03:33.523
Look, I'm not interested
in any more handouts

03:33.523 --> 03:35.042
from the Pickman Corporation.

03:41.428 --> 03:44.085
Mr. Peters,
what if I were to tell you

03:44.085 --> 03:46.467
that Pickman is
selecting candidates

03:46.467 --> 03:48.331
for some new research?

03:48.331 --> 03:49.539
An expedition.

03:50.437 --> 03:52.956
One might say it's an
astrobiologist's

03:52.956 --> 03:54.717
dream come true.

03:54.717 --> 03:55.649
An expedition?

03:57.064 --> 03:59.515
Our teams have been doing
research in the Antarctic

03:59.515 --> 04:03.139
and Southern Atlantic oceans
for the past seven years,

04:03.139 --> 04:06.522
until a few months ago when
we found something unexpected.

04:13.460 --> 04:17.498
Our team mapped a trench in the
Antarctic continental shelf,

04:17.498 --> 04:19.845
west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

04:19.845 --> 04:22.710
between South America
and Antarctica.

04:22.710 --> 04:26.542
We've collected over 12,000
square kilometers of data,

04:26.542 --> 04:29.441
and we found a new
deepest point in the ocean

04:29.441 --> 04:31.995
of 37,000 feet.

04:31.995 --> 04:33.376
How can that be possible?

04:33.376 --> 04:36.276
We knew that the continental
shelf was unusually deep,

04:36.276 --> 04:39.520
but it was something
else, on the ocean floor,

04:39.520 --> 04:43.386
that, uh, caught us by
surprise, shall we say.

04:47.010 --> 04:49.703
This is footage from a
remote control sub

04:49.703 --> 04:51.498
we sent down there.

04:51.498 --> 04:52.775
What is that?

04:53.707 --> 04:54.949
It looks almost man-made.

04:56.365 --> 04:59.954
Well, we have a theory that
it's some kind of portal.

05:00.783 --> 05:01.784
To where?

05:02.923 --> 05:05.753
That, Mr. Peters, is what
we're going to find out.

05:05.753 --> 05:08.998
Pickman wants you to
join the expedition team.

05:12.035 --> 05:14.348
I have some people I'd
like you to meet.

05:18.594 --> 05:21.769
Thank you, everyone, for
attending at such short notice.

05:21.769 --> 05:24.013
You're finally about to
see why this interruption

05:24.013 --> 05:27.810
to your busy lives is
so very worth your time.

05:27.810 --> 05:29.639
I'll make the introductions.

05:29.639 --> 05:31.952
This is Gordon Atkins,

05:31.952 --> 05:34.575
head of the manned
submersibles laboratory

05:34.575 --> 05:38.648
at London's Royal Society for
Improving Natural Knowledge.

05:38.648 --> 05:41.030
Uh, he's agreed to lead
our expedition,

05:41.030 --> 05:44.827
and is by far the most
qualified man for the job.

05:44.827 --> 05:47.450
Christine Harris,
marine biologist

05:47.450 --> 05:51.592
and member of the European
Marine Biology Symposium.

05:51.592 --> 05:55.009
James Peters is developing
our discovery programs

05:55.009 --> 05:58.392
at the prestigious
Miskatonic University

05:58.392 --> 06:01.050
and is something of an
expert in the field

06:01.050 --> 06:04.571
of Pickman Corp's
early research.

06:04.571 --> 06:09.472
Joseph Meeker is our safety
and communications officer.

06:09.472 --> 06:13.959
And finally, Hank O'Connell,
our lead engineer.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.030
Hank, the floor is yours.

06:18.688 --> 06:19.965
Hello, everyone.

06:19.965 --> 06:22.174
I'm really very pleased
to meet you, finally.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.694
I expect you will be wondering
what it is I've engineered.

06:24.694 --> 06:26.420
Through the Pickman Corporation,

06:26.420 --> 06:30.010
my team have managed to build
a deep-diving submersible

06:30.010 --> 06:32.046
like nothing that's ever
existed before.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.397
This is Providence 3.

06:38.501 --> 06:41.849
250 tons, built with
syntactic foam,

06:41.849 --> 06:44.714
capable of withstanding
the huge compressive forces

06:44.714 --> 06:48.269
of the water at 37,000
feet and below.

06:48.269 --> 06:49.788
Impressive, Hank.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.859
Makes you wonder what happened
to Providence 1 and 2 though.

06:51.859 --> 06:54.621
So state of the art
that it can safely

06:54.621 --> 06:56.795
take us into this
ancient opening

06:56.795 --> 06:58.659
in the earth's seabed
hydrosphere.

07:00.903 --> 07:02.870
I'm sorry, into the opening?

07:02.870 --> 07:04.803
Didn't you say you sent
remote operated vehicles

07:04.803 --> 07:06.046
in that never came out?

07:06.046 --> 07:07.496
Oh, yes, some have
made it back.

07:07.496 --> 07:08.497
Some?

07:08.497 --> 07:10.533
Listen, we aren't
going to pretend

07:10.533 --> 07:12.742
that this isn't a
risky expedition.

07:12.742 --> 07:14.503
We wouldn't launch Providence 3

07:14.503 --> 07:18.127
with a crew on board if
we weren't 100% certain

07:18.127 --> 07:20.267
our technology was safe.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.682
Test dives have been completed

07:21.682 --> 07:24.478
with highly satisfying results.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.515
Now all it needs is a crew.

07:26.515 --> 07:28.689
What do you expect
us to find down there?

07:28.689 --> 07:31.830
What if there's nothing but
pitch-black, watery abyss?

07:31.830 --> 07:36.179
The ocean is the last
great frontier of our world.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.502
Now, I have dedicated
my whole life

07:48.502 --> 07:52.713
to seeking out the unknown and
the incomprehensible,

07:52.713 --> 07:56.441
and this gateway might be my
greatest discovery.

07:57.718 --> 08:00.928
It demands to be explored,
Ms. Harris.

08:00.928 --> 08:03.344
If something built
that structure,

08:04.173 --> 08:07.487
just imagine what might
lie within it.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.110
Secrets of the ocean.

08:10.973 --> 08:12.802
And there is a hidden
world beneath us,

08:12.802 --> 08:16.910
gentlemen, ladies, unseen
by human eyes,

08:16.910 --> 08:19.947
because up until now we
have been unable

08:19.947 --> 08:24.780
to create the technology
necessary to take us there.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.714
Your mission as the crew
of Providence 3

08:27.714 --> 08:31.683
is to be that interface
between our technology

08:31.683 --> 08:36.723
and that new dark continent
we aim to explore.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.313
These files contain the
key data collected so far,

08:41.313 --> 08:43.039
and outline the expedition.

08:44.075 --> 08:46.215
You'll need to complete
two months of training

08:46.215 --> 08:47.941
before the dive.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.012
Read them closely.

08:50.012 --> 08:54.464
You have 24 hours to decide
whether you're in or out.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.954
James.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.370
I'm so glad you came.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.235
Walt would be so proud to
see us exploring

09:06.235 --> 09:07.926
the unknown together.

09:07.926 --> 09:08.962
Thank you, Mr. Pickman.

09:09.652 --> 09:11.136
It's a lot to think about.

09:11.136 --> 09:15.244
It is, but I wouldn't want
to make this trip without you,

09:15.244 --> 09:18.212
it wouldn't seem right,
for Walt's sake.

09:18.212 --> 09:19.420
I need you there.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.636
I've been counting
down the days

09:27.636 --> 09:29.051
to finally meeting in this crew.

09:29.051 --> 09:30.224
We've worked so hard,

09:30.224 --> 09:32.744
overcome so many
challenges to get this far.

09:32.744 --> 09:33.952
All right, who wants
another drink?

09:33.952 --> 09:35.402
- No.
- Ooh, yes, please.

09:35.402 --> 09:36.852
- Yeah? Gotcha.
- Thank you.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.374
Well, I don't think
we'll be eating like this

09:42.374 --> 09:43.583
at the bottom of the ocean,

09:43.583 --> 09:45.861
so I'm gonna enjoy it
while I can.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.070
You up for it then?

09:48.070 --> 09:49.623
What, a voyage the
deepest part

09:49.623 --> 09:51.452
of the planet
anyone's ever been?

09:51.452 --> 09:52.522
How could I walk away from that?

09:52.522 --> 09:54.041
Aah, there's
nothing to beat it,

09:54.041 --> 09:56.216
being out there in the deep sea.

09:56.216 --> 09:59.599
Firsthand research, it's
what we're born to do, right?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.324
You know, I just,
I can't comprehend

10:01.324 --> 10:04.914
the water pressure at
30,000 feet or whatever.

10:04.914 --> 10:08.021
Weight of an entire
ocean pressing down on you.

10:08.021 --> 10:09.263
If anything goes wrong.

10:09.263 --> 10:11.265
All right, now I'm worried.

10:11.265 --> 10:13.095
You now, you're putting
your life in my hands.

10:13.095 --> 10:14.544
Very capable hands, though.

10:14.544 --> 10:17.858
Okay, here we go.

10:17.858 --> 10:20.447
- Cheers, team.
-  Cheers.

10:21.966 --> 10:25.107
It's not really what we were
designed to do though, is it?

10:25.107 --> 10:28.662
- It sounds risky.
- Ah, expect the unexpected...

10:28.662 --> 10:30.560
First rule of deep
sea exploration.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.942
Wow, well, we'll all sleep
better tonight knowing that.

10:32.942 --> 10:35.255
Thank you, Gordon.

10:35.255 --> 10:36.636
You've done this before then?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.396
Ah, many times.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.054
Never this deep though.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.642
We'll be setting a new record.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.955
Everything you do is five
times harder in the ocean, okay?

10:45.955 --> 10:47.267
Just remember that.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.683
But you're still going
along with it, all of you?

10:49.683 --> 10:51.029
Well, look, it's like
the old man said,

10:51.029 --> 10:52.721
"It is the chance of
a lifetime."

10:53.791 --> 10:56.379
Well, team, to Providence 3.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.554
To Providence 3.

11:01.005 --> 11:03.145
Guys, I need some fresh
air, I'll be right back.

11:03.145 --> 11:04.525
Hm, do you want me to
get you another drink?

11:04.525 --> 11:06.389
No, no, I've had enough, really.

11:09.565 --> 11:10.704
Sorry. Ex- excuse me.

11:19.506 --> 11:20.956
Hey, you okay?

11:22.198 --> 11:25.615
Um, doesn't it
scare you at all?

11:26.789 --> 11:28.204
Um, I don't know.

11:30.379 --> 11:33.554
I have this, um,
respect for the ocean.

11:33.554 --> 11:34.728
I mean, it's my life,

11:34.728 --> 11:37.662
but I know it can turn
on you in a heartbeat.

11:40.665 --> 11:44.186
So you think the others
know who you are, Peters?

11:44.186 --> 11:46.498
Or they haven't put two
and two together yet?

11:46.498 --> 11:47.603
So you noticed?

11:47.603 --> 11:48.777
Yeah.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.917
I mean, obviously I
had to research Pickman

11:50.917 --> 11:53.505
when Dr. Goldstein contacted us,
you know?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.991
See what he's into. His history.

11:57.164 --> 11:59.028
What was it like growing up
around something like that?

11:59.028 --> 12:01.721
I mean, the stories and,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.344
and the legends,
and all the theories.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.174
I'd rather just
have my dad back.

12:08.486 --> 12:10.177
You mean they really
never found him?

12:10.177 --> 12:14.009
That wasn't some hook
just to sell more copies?

12:14.009 --> 12:15.355
Gone without a trace.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.737
I'm sorry.

12:18.841 --> 12:20.774
Hey, it's okay.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.983
Um, it was a long time ago.

12:27.470 --> 12:29.921
Look, Jim, I don't
think they would

12:29.921 --> 12:31.751
send us down there and
spend all this money

12:31.751 --> 12:34.477
if they weren't certain there
was more for us to discover.

12:34.477 --> 12:35.996
What you think there's
something they're

12:35.996 --> 12:37.032
not telling us?

12:37.515 --> 12:38.585
If I go on this expedition,

12:38.585 --> 12:40.587
I need to know that
I'm coming home.

12:43.970 --> 12:45.385
This is my son.

12:45.385 --> 12:47.283
He's, um, he's seven months old,

12:47.283 --> 12:49.976
and I'm all he is got.

12:49.976 --> 12:51.287
My parents are
looking after him.

12:51.287 --> 12:52.806
And what's he called?

12:52.806 --> 12:53.703
Sam.

12:54.946 --> 12:57.293
Uh, look, I, I know what a
huge sacrifice I'll be making.

12:57.293 --> 12:59.226
I mean, with the, with
the training and,

12:59.226 --> 13:02.091
and the trip, and the time
away from him is gonna kill me,

13:02.091 --> 13:05.267
but if everything goes to plan,

13:05.267 --> 13:07.614
I'll be back before his
first birthday and...

13:09.029 --> 13:11.514
Maybe I can live with that.

13:11.514 --> 13:14.034
And what if it
doesn't go to plan?

13:14.034 --> 13:16.278
Something tells me
these things rarely do.

13:38.162 --> 13:40.371
- Mr. Pickman.
- Thank you.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.246
You all ready there, Jim?

13:53.246 --> 13:55.282
I can't say I slept
much last night.

13:55.282 --> 13:58.078
Just goin' over and over
everything, you know?

13:58.078 --> 13:59.873
Everything that could go wrong.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.047
That's normal, Jim.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.946
You know shouldn't
smoke so much, Captain.

14:03.946 --> 14:05.534
It increases anxiety
and tension.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.018
I like to be tense, dear.

14:07.018 --> 14:08.951
It keeps the senses sharp.

14:08.951 --> 14:10.850
You wanna ciggy, Jim?
- Nah, no thanks.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.369
- You wanna dramamine?
- Ooh, you have some?

14:15.095 --> 14:16.925
Hey, uh, how far are we goin'?

14:18.167 --> 14:19.203
You'll see.

14:20.135 --> 14:22.689
She's out there waiting for us.

15:01.245 --> 15:02.487
<i>Command Center,
standby,</i>

15:02.487 --> 15:05.007
<i>we are awaiting crew's
arrival at Providence 3.</i>

15:11.324 --> 15:12.739
Morning, Dr. Goldstein.

15:12.739 --> 15:13.947
How long?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.432
We are launching in one hour.

15:16.432 --> 15:17.640
Weather conditions are
looking perfect

15:17.640 --> 15:19.297
for another cup of hours.

15:19.297 --> 15:20.643
Where's our feed?

15:20.643 --> 15:23.439
P3 rear cam one and
rear cam two,

15:23.439 --> 15:24.647
we have a clear signal.

15:24.647 --> 15:26.546
P3 front cam is live.

15:26.546 --> 15:29.514
And the rover cameras will
be activated upon launch.

15:29.514 --> 15:30.688
We're all set for them.

15:36.832 --> 15:38.109
<i>Crew approaching P3.</i>

15:38.109 --> 15:41.423
<i>Commence launch operation
in T minus 12 minutes.</i>

15:41.423 --> 15:42.493
Standby for entry.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.908
Welcome to Providence.

16:21.083 --> 16:22.360
Okay, team, let's go, go, go!

16:22.360 --> 16:24.431
We've got 20 hours of
life support!

16:24.431 --> 16:26.709
It takes one hour and 30
minutes to get to the seabed.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.195
Let's not waste any oxygen.

16:29.195 --> 16:30.368
Chris.

17:04.678 --> 17:08.268
Man, oh, man, this is
not a simulation anymore.

17:24.664 --> 17:26.804
You ready to pilot that thing,
Jimmy?

17:28.392 --> 17:29.910
I have a dreadful
feeling I'm looking

17:29.910 --> 17:31.740
at my own very expensive coffin.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.432
What, two months training
wasn't enough for you?

17:34.432 --> 17:37.056
You're collecting rock
samples, not landing on Mars.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.922
What's the difference?

17:41.922 --> 17:45.478
This is Providence 3
to DP control.

17:45.478 --> 17:47.169
<i>How do you copy, over?</i>

17:47.169 --> 17:48.998
We're receiving you
loud and clear, P3.

17:48.998 --> 17:53.313
Okay, you have a good
comms voice here.

17:53.313 --> 17:54.797
Is that you, Ms. Rachel?

17:54.797 --> 17:56.558
<i>How's it looking out there,
Gordon?</i>

18:00.251 --> 18:03.737
Life support's good,
O2 level's good.

18:03.737 --> 18:06.119
Oh, we're groovy.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.776
<i>Apart from the fact
there's 1000 horrible ways</i>

18:07.776 --> 18:10.710
<i>to die down here at the
bottom of the ocean,</i>

18:12.332 --> 18:14.127
we're feeling pretty
great about it.

18:18.787 --> 18:20.513
Okay, Mr. Pickman?

18:20.513 --> 18:22.618
More than okay.

18:24.862 --> 18:25.966
She's remarkable.

18:54.202 --> 18:55.720
Hatch is secure, Captain.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.825
Roger that, Hank.

18:59.759 --> 19:04.798
Be advised, we are in position
and go for launch ops.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.387
Three minutes to commence
launch operation, over

19:07.387 --> 19:09.217
Roger that, DP control.

19:10.839 --> 19:12.047
I'm gonna open the vent.

19:13.117 --> 19:15.050
We are clear to vent.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.085
Opening now.

19:49.671 --> 19:51.224
Don't worry.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.122
If it buckles, the
whole thing will implode

19:53.122 --> 19:54.710
at hypersonic speed,

19:54.710 --> 19:57.299
and we'll be jelly in a
matter of micro seconds.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.335
What?

19:59.094 --> 20:01.130
You won't have time to
even know it's happened.

20:28.779 --> 20:30.643
Pre-dive safety briefing's
already completed.

20:30.643 --> 20:32.748
<i>All right, P3,
let's do final checks.</i>

20:32.748 --> 20:34.163
Final checks.

20:34.163 --> 20:37.822
Vision one, CO2 is
running at 0.3%.

20:37.822 --> 20:39.617
Scrubber fan is running.

20:39.617 --> 20:41.032
Depth gauge is working.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.482
Compass is working.

20:42.482 --> 20:45.071
Okay, and I think we're ready.

20:45.071 --> 20:47.487
DP control, we are
clear to launch.

20:47.487 --> 20:48.626
Affirmative.

20:48.626 --> 20:51.111
Good luck on your
voyage to the deep, P3.

20:51.111 --> 20:52.872
You have permission to dive.

20:53.942 --> 20:55.081
<i>Copy that.</i>

20:55.081 --> 20:56.255
Heading down.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.260
Say goodbye to the
surface world.

21:10.786 --> 21:12.374
Approaching 20 meters.

21:12.374 --> 21:14.480
Vents are secure.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.515
40 Meters.

21:18.553 --> 21:20.071
P3, what's your speed?

21:20.071 --> 21:22.384
Vertical speed, 3.4 knots.

21:22.384 --> 21:24.697
I have good control.

21:24.697 --> 21:25.801
Copy that.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.976
We're losing light already.

21:27.976 --> 21:29.495
Approaching 100 meters.

21:29.495 --> 21:31.462
Okay, team, good job.

21:31.462 --> 21:33.015
Right on course.

21:42.059 --> 21:43.647
10,500 meters.

21:44.544 --> 21:46.339
Five minutes 'til target depth.

21:46.339 --> 21:49.515
In 400 meters, we've
set a new record.

21:54.968 --> 21:56.763
The pressure lock.

22:06.290 --> 22:09.224
Once the rover is fully
submerged, we seal you in.

22:09.224 --> 22:10.881
then we activate the exit doors.

22:17.094 --> 22:19.441
Then, you're on your
own out there,

22:19.441 --> 22:21.374
ready to explore the deep.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.756
Just remember you're training.

22:23.756 --> 22:24.791
Piece of cake.

22:25.551 --> 22:26.966
Hank! Jim!

22:26.966 --> 22:29.037
You need to come see this.

22:35.802 --> 22:38.046
- What is it?
- Turn up front spotlight.

22:39.875 --> 22:41.877
Are you ready to see
this in person?

22:41.877 --> 22:43.051
We're here already?

22:43.051 --> 22:44.639
X coordinates minus 106,

22:44.639 --> 22:46.951
Y coordinates minus 79.

22:46.951 --> 22:50.196
DP control, we have arrived.

23:04.624 --> 23:06.799
<i>Just keep talking,
P3.</i>

23:06.799 --> 23:10.319
We're looking at a
huge carbonate structure,

23:10.319 --> 23:12.391
a circular gateway.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.392
It's unreal.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.048
Yeah, planet earth's butthole,

23:15.048 --> 23:16.429
just where I wanna be.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.812
No volcanic activity
causes this kind of detail.

23:19.812 --> 23:21.089
These rocks were put here.

23:21.089 --> 23:23.885
By what? They're the
size of houses.

23:23.885 --> 23:25.507
All I know is that this
place will teach us more

23:25.507 --> 23:27.129
than we've ever dreamed.

23:27.129 --> 23:30.305
I'm easing us into
the gateway.

23:31.306 --> 23:34.516
<i>Speed is 2.3 knots.</i>

23:35.724 --> 23:37.623
Spotlights are facing forward,

23:37.623 --> 23:42.144
but we're just headed
into absolute darkness.

23:42.144 --> 23:43.663
P3, you must keep
talking to us

23:43.663 --> 23:45.078
as you move into the gateway.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.839
The signal is currently
running at 100%.

23:46.839 --> 23:48.496
Everything's stable.

23:48.496 --> 23:50.601
Picture is all good on
front and rear cams.

23:50.601 --> 23:52.534
We're loud and clear.

24:25.049 --> 24:26.292
Gordon!

24:26.292 --> 24:28.570
-  <i>P3?</i>
- Everything's shutting down!

24:28.570 --> 24:29.571
What's going on down there?

24:29.571 --> 24:30.848
I've lost thrusters.

24:30.848 --> 24:32.712
Hank!
- P3, come in.

24:32.712 --> 24:33.782
We're losing them.

24:33.782 --> 24:35.163
Try to get a better signal.

24:35.163 --> 24:37.130
I am trying.

24:41.997 --> 24:43.516
Activate emergency power!

24:47.934 --> 24:50.523
DP control,
are you reading?

24:50.523 --> 24:52.387
Come in, DP control!

24:52.387 --> 24:54.216
Rachel, can you hear us?

24:54.216 --> 24:55.390
DP--
- We've lost them!

24:55.390 --> 24:58.289
Hey, everybody just cool it,
all right?

24:58.289 --> 25:00.809
Gordon, are the thrusters
still malfunctioning?

25:00.809 --> 25:01.914
It's everything, Hank.

25:01.914 --> 25:03.605
Everything has shut down.

25:03.605 --> 25:05.400
We're still sinking.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.195
Depth is approaching
1100 meters.

25:07.195 --> 25:08.748
I'm dropping our weights,
we can't just sit here.

25:08.748 --> 25:11.130
- No, no, stop. Stop!
- Hang on, Gordon, not yet.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.165
Give it a chance.

25:12.165 --> 25:13.442
Remember where we are?

25:13.442 --> 25:14.478
We made it.

25:15.237 --> 25:17.170
- I've gotta find Pickman.
- Wait.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.621
Take this.

25:24.488 --> 25:26.732
I guess we're on our own
down here then.

25:32.358 --> 25:35.603
Jesus, Pickman!

25:35.603 --> 25:37.743
We found them.

25:43.058 --> 25:45.371
All right, we're back on.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.512
<i>P3, do you copy?</i>

25:49.478 --> 25:51.273
<i>Come in P3.</i>

25:51.273 --> 25:52.792
DP control, we copy.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.414
What happened down there?

25:54.414 --> 25:55.450
<i>It looks like we lost power</i>

25:55.450 --> 25:56.589
when we entered the portal.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.591
We've definitely stumbled
on something here.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.766
<i>Three hours of radio silence,</i>

26:00.766 --> 26:03.492
you don't know how glad
I am to hear your voice.

26:03.492 --> 26:06.495
Three hours?
Did she say three hours?

26:06.495 --> 26:07.738
Please repeat, DP control.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.602
How long did you say
we were out of contact?

26:09.602 --> 26:11.397
<i>Three hours and 12 minutes</i>

26:11.397 --> 26:13.261
since your last transmission,
P3.

26:13.261 --> 26:14.400
That's impossible.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.989
Hank, check our life support.

26:23.029 --> 26:26.999
Life support has decreased
approximately three hours.

26:26.999 --> 26:29.484
She's right.
- What does that mean?

26:29.484 --> 26:31.451
<i>We're not
getting anything up here, P3.</i>

26:31.451 --> 26:32.452
There's disruption on the feed,

26:32.452 --> 26:34.316
a lot of static interference.

26:34.316 --> 26:35.283
Oh my God.

26:38.838 --> 26:40.529
Describe what
we're looking at.

26:42.117 --> 26:43.291
Uh, okay.

26:43.291 --> 26:45.604
Um, I hope you can hear me
clearly enough.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.503
<i>We're,
we're drifting above</i>

26:48.503 --> 26:51.161
a huge ancient ruin.

26:52.058 --> 26:54.854
There are decayed stone
structures as,

26:54.854 --> 26:57.167
as big as mountains.

26:58.064 --> 26:59.894
How could there have
ever been life down here?

26:59.894 --> 27:01.792
Sunlight could have
never reached this place.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.829
That implies a whole
new basis of life.

27:03.829 --> 27:06.625
One that doesn't need the sun,
only water.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.798
And darkness.

27:07.798 --> 27:09.628
Maybe it wasn't
always underwater.

27:10.767 --> 27:13.252
There's something
on the seabed.

27:13.252 --> 27:15.703
-  What is that?
- Uh, maneuver the camera.

27:15.703 --> 27:17.118
Pan, pan down.

27:17.118 --> 27:19.085
Get a better view of it.

27:26.714 --> 27:28.163
Rachel, are you seeing this?

27:29.475 --> 27:31.339
I think I'm getting something.

27:31.339 --> 27:32.374
Look.

27:35.412 --> 27:36.724
Fuck!

27:36.724 --> 27:41.556
That looks like some kind
of life form, doesn't it?

27:41.556 --> 27:42.591
Copy that.

27:42.591 --> 27:43.938
Impossible.

27:43.938 --> 27:45.456
It's definitely some
sort of remains,

27:45.456 --> 27:47.735
buried under centuries
of sediment buildup.

27:49.184 --> 27:50.530
I want to get a
closer look at that.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.118
Where is Mr. Peters?

27:52.118 --> 27:53.154
He's right here.

27:55.604 --> 27:56.536
Peters.

27:56.536 --> 27:58.504
James, I need a tissue sample

27:58.504 --> 28:02.508
from that deep sea organism,
whatever it is, understood?

28:02.508 --> 28:03.474
Copy that.

28:09.653 --> 28:11.379
This is the payoff.

28:12.345 --> 28:15.901
The answer to our
deepest wonders.

28:15.901 --> 28:19.490
<i>So many secrets we must know.</i>

28:19.490 --> 28:21.665
It's on you, Jim.

28:54.042 --> 28:56.010
Are you gonna be all right?

28:56.010 --> 28:57.597
Yeah.

29:19.378 --> 29:20.897
I'll be all right.

29:21.863 --> 29:23.416
Repressurizing lock.

29:23.416 --> 29:24.624
Brace for launch, Jim

29:49.028 --> 29:51.824
Rover clear for launch.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.516
Opening pressure lock
outer doors...

29:54.516 --> 29:55.483
Now.

30:00.419 --> 30:02.179
Launch successful.

30:02.179 --> 30:03.215
You okay?

30:04.009 --> 30:06.114
Just don't let anything
happen to him out there.

30:07.495 --> 30:08.876
Jim, are you receiving?

30:08.876 --> 30:10.705
<i>Life support's
all good.</i>

30:11.326 --> 30:13.328
There is more current
down here than I expected,

30:13.328 --> 30:15.434
but I've got good control.

30:15.434 --> 30:18.023
Okay, take her down.

30:18.023 --> 30:19.714
<i>All lights facing down.</i>

30:19.714 --> 30:23.028
Increasing vertical
speed to 1.4 knots.

30:24.029 --> 30:25.202
You doing good, Jim.

30:25.202 --> 30:26.652
38,000 feet.

30:26.652 --> 30:30.863
Oh, man, it feels pretty
lonely out here right now.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.003
We're right here with you,
Jim.

30:37.214 --> 30:39.734
Guys, are you seein' this?

30:46.361 --> 30:48.881
We have a clear image
from all rover cams.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.227
Gently now.

30:50.227 --> 30:52.022
<i>300 units of
down thrust.</i>

30:52.022 --> 30:55.129
Take it easy, Jim, you're
right on top of that thing.

30:55.129 --> 30:57.165
Look at that creature.

31:04.552 --> 31:06.934
Gordon, what was this?

31:06.934 --> 31:09.902
Starboard 20
degrees and ease her down.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.698
Whatever this
thing was, it's colossal.

31:12.698 --> 31:13.802
<i>Up close, could have
been as tall</i>

31:13.802 --> 31:14.976
<i>as the Empire State Building.</i>

31:14.976 --> 31:17.289
Okay, Jim, you can't
afford to waste much time.

31:17.289 --> 31:19.360
Get the tissue sample,
get the hell out of there.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.327
Affirmative. I'm in position.

31:21.327 --> 31:22.673
His depth gauge isn't
reading anything,

31:22.673 --> 31:24.054
should we be worried?

31:24.054 --> 31:26.988
We haven't got time
to worry. He's doing fine.

31:29.370 --> 31:31.199
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

31:31.199 --> 31:33.926
Oh, Jesus, it's like
whale blubber.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.755
Looks like some sort
of cephalopod.

31:35.755 --> 31:40.622
Deep-sea gigantism on
an epic scale.

31:40.622 --> 31:43.418
I can't understand how
it hasn't deteriorated.

31:43.418 --> 31:45.938
Maybe the dissolved
oxygen levels down here?

31:45.938 --> 31:47.940
Makes you wonder how
long it's been dead.

31:49.355 --> 31:51.323
Guys, check out rear cams,
something moving out there.

31:51.323 --> 31:52.807
- Moving?
- You didn't see it?

31:52.807 --> 31:54.809
I've almost finished
the incision.

31:54.809 --> 31:55.948
I can't see shit out here.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.122
Gordon, I'm picking
up movement.

31:57.122 --> 31:59.745
Impossible, nothing
could be alive down here.

31:59.745 --> 32:01.333
- It's reading a life-form.
- It's reading Jim.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.644
This is too big to be
Jim, this is massive!

32:02.644 --> 32:03.956
Well, then it's reading wrong.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.544
Everything's glitching
since we entered the portal.

32:05.544 --> 32:06.959
- Jim needs--
- We don't say anything

32:06.959 --> 32:08.547
until he's got the
sample, he's nearly there.

32:08.547 --> 32:09.755
He might be in danger!

32:09.755 --> 32:11.239
One more minute and
he has got the sample!

32:11.239 --> 32:13.379
He might not have a minute!
Let me talk to him!

32:13.379 --> 32:14.622
- Stop!
- The corporation did

32:14.622 --> 32:16.210
not spend all of this money

32:16.210 --> 32:17.521
for us to come back
with nothing!

32:17.521 --> 32:18.833
Let Jim do his job!

32:20.076 --> 32:21.594
<i>All right, guys,
I got it, I got it.</i>

32:21.594 --> 32:22.595
Okay, Jim.

32:22.595 --> 32:23.458
Gordon, please get
him out there.

32:23.458 --> 32:24.839
Is the sample secure, Jim?

32:24.839 --> 32:26.151
Just a little longer.

32:26.151 --> 32:27.393
The sample is secure,

32:27.393 --> 32:29.671
but I've lost my starboard
horizontal thruster.

32:29.671 --> 32:32.536
Guys, I've got a lot of
failures here.

32:32.536 --> 32:33.572
<i>This isn't looking good.</i>

32:33.572 --> 32:35.988
Don't panic, Jim.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.403
Jim, please respond!

32:37.403 --> 32:39.371
He's not hearing us.

32:39.371 --> 32:40.613
Signal's gone.

32:40.613 --> 32:41.994
Hello? Gordon?

32:48.414 --> 32:50.002
It's moving again,
whatever it is.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.004
<i>We've just lost
communication</i>

32:52.004 --> 32:53.454
<i>with port [indistinct].</i>

32:53.454 --> 32:57.147
<i>Something's scrambling
our radios out there.</i>

33:07.468 --> 33:09.090
- Don't lose him!
- What the fuck is that?

33:09.090 --> 33:10.298
I'm not
going any closer.

33:10.298 --> 33:11.403
We're not leaving without Jim!

33:11.403 --> 33:12.783
Take us down!
- Are you insane?

33:19.721 --> 33:23.656
This is
what you wanted, Pickman,

33:23.656 --> 33:26.349
an encounter with the Gods?

33:27.108 --> 33:31.181
Aren't they as
immeasurable as you recall?

33:31.181 --> 33:34.012
DP control,
permission to abort.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.530
<i>Permission denied,
Atkins.</i>

33:35.530 --> 33:37.912
Retrieve that rover before
you begin your ascent.

33:37.912 --> 33:40.225
Are you not seeing this?

33:40.225 --> 33:41.709
Permission to abort!

33:41.709 --> 33:43.607
Permission denied, Gordon.

33:43.607 --> 33:45.851
I'm not losing that sample.

33:52.202 --> 33:54.239
Hank, fill the pressure lock,

33:54.239 --> 33:56.448
we're bringing him in now.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.901
<i>Some strange
electromagnetism in the air.</i>

34:03.524 --> 34:05.560
- Argh!
- Gordon, take us down!

34:05.560 --> 34:06.630
What is that?

34:06.630 --> 34:09.081
Goddamn it, Gordon,
take us down!

34:09.081 --> 34:10.082
Get out!

34:11.325 --> 34:12.429
No!

34:12.429 --> 34:13.499
I'm taking us down.

34:13.499 --> 34:16.054
No, we're too close!

34:16.054 --> 34:16.985
Fuck!

34:24.510 --> 34:26.443
Hank, help me!

34:26.443 --> 34:27.651
Christine!

34:30.585 --> 34:31.586
No!

34:40.664 --> 34:41.665
Christine!

34:43.943 --> 34:45.807
P3, my thrusters are back.

34:45.807 --> 34:47.706
Your air supply is
not looking good,

34:47.706 --> 34:49.915
get as close to us as you can!

34:49.915 --> 34:51.089
We gotta move!

34:58.751 --> 34:59.994
Gordon, I'm heading back!

34:59.994 --> 35:01.789
Jim, prepare to board.

35:01.789 --> 35:03.411
No, no, stop!

35:04.447 --> 35:06.345
Gordon, stop!

35:06.345 --> 35:08.692
Don't open the outer doors!

35:10.936 --> 35:12.765
Christine! She's in the
pressure dock!

35:12.765 --> 35:14.526
- What?
- She's in the water.

35:14.526 --> 35:15.699
Open up the inner doors,
the inner door!

35:15.699 --> 35:17.287
<i>There isn't time!</i>

35:17.287 --> 35:18.702
You'll blast her
into the ocean!

35:18.702 --> 35:22.016
She'll die, Gordon!

35:22.016 --> 35:24.363
Jim, you'll have to hang on.

35:26.331 --> 35:29.057
Christine ah, I'm coming.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.131
Hurry up!

35:50.389 --> 35:52.080
No.
No, no.

35:53.220 --> 35:54.738
Come on, gimme a hand!

35:54.738 --> 35:56.430
Help me get her out!

35:57.707 --> 35:59.226
Gordon, the doors
aren't opening.

36:01.331 --> 36:02.884
Gordon, I'm outside.

36:02.884 --> 36:05.577
Jim, hang in there,
we've got a problem!

36:05.577 --> 36:07.337
Chris is trapped in the
pressure lock!

36:07.337 --> 36:08.407
- What?
<i>- You'll have to wait</i>

36:08.407 --> 36:09.857
for the pressure lock to reseal!

36:09.857 --> 36:11.445
I can't let you in!

36:13.688 --> 36:15.483
- Christine!
- Hank, quick,

36:15.483 --> 36:17.416
Pull her out.
- All right.

36:21.489 --> 36:22.766
What the fuck?

36:31.603 --> 36:33.018
- That's it, grab it.
- Pull up.

36:33.018 --> 36:35.054
Come on, quick. Quick.

36:43.546 --> 36:44.719
All right, Joe, help her.

36:44.719 --> 36:46.204
Help her? She's fucking dead!

36:46.204 --> 36:48.689
Well do something, you're
the fucking safety officer!

36:50.967 --> 36:53.141
Gordon, I'm closing the
pressure lock.

37:31.697 --> 37:34.700
Hank, we're
taking on water!

37:34.700 --> 37:37.185
The front end is compromised!

37:37.185 --> 37:39.429
Hank, what's going
on down there?

37:39.429 --> 37:40.327
Hank!

37:40.327 --> 37:42.674
Gordon, I think we lost her.

37:42.674 --> 37:45.090
Never mind that, Hank.
Check the bunk rooms.

37:45.090 --> 37:47.679
I'm reading severe
damage down there.

37:47.679 --> 37:49.163
This whole sub is gonna go down

37:49.163 --> 37:51.303
if I don't drop weight now!

37:53.892 --> 37:56.343
Jim, I'm opening the
outer doors.

37:56.343 --> 37:58.310
Hold on, I'm getting
into position.

37:59.656 --> 38:00.864
Fuck!

38:00.864 --> 38:03.660
<i>God, Jim, get
your ass in here now!</i>

38:07.008 --> 38:08.596
Pickman, get up!

38:08.596 --> 38:09.977
Get out of here!

38:19.918 --> 38:22.507
10 more seconds, Gordon.

38:22.507 --> 38:23.404
Hurry!

38:28.098 --> 38:30.998
Gordon, the entire bunk
room's flooded.

38:30.998 --> 38:32.689
I'm sealing off this corridor.

38:32.689 --> 38:35.968
Drop weights now or the
water will drag us down!

38:35.968 --> 38:38.108
The pressure doors are
still closing.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.040
Jim's in there!

38:39.040 --> 38:41.905
We don't have time, Gordon!

38:41.905 --> 38:45.150
And we, we can't ascend with
this much water on board!

38:45.150 --> 38:47.359
Gordon!
- Five seconds, Hank!

38:47.359 --> 38:49.430
We can wait five seconds!

38:52.709 --> 38:55.436
It's too late, Jim,
I'm dropping weights.

38:55.436 --> 38:56.403
Hold on!

39:20.910 --> 39:23.188
<i>
does anybody copy?</i>

39:23.188 --> 39:25.293
DB control, we're
leaving the bottom

39:25.293 --> 39:29.228
at X minus 278, Y minus 78!

39:29.228 --> 39:31.196
Is it following you, Gordon?

39:31.196 --> 39:33.888
I don't know! Check the radar!

39:35.234 --> 39:36.374
No!

39:36.374 --> 39:37.961
No, no, no!

39:37.961 --> 39:40.550
No.

39:44.899 --> 39:47.626
I can't get the second
door to close!

39:47.626 --> 39:48.800
It's jammed!

39:48.800 --> 39:51.078
Ugh, I can't get out.

39:51.906 --> 39:53.080
Look at it, Hank.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.842
Look at the devastation
they can cause.

39:56.842 --> 40:00.398
Just one of them
against all of us.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.711
- What?
- Our brilliant minds,

40:03.711 --> 40:06.093
totally defenseless
against them.

40:08.060 --> 40:09.303
What are talking about?

40:09.303 --> 40:12.582
They're brilliant, Hank, brilliant.

40:28.253 --> 40:29.219
No! No!

40:32.360 --> 40:34.915
No, no, no, no, no!

40:34.915 --> 40:37.227
Why won't you help her?

40:37.227 --> 40:39.471
Why won't you help, dammit?

40:41.508 --> 40:43.820
Jesus, no.

40:43.820 --> 40:44.821
No!

40:46.271 --> 40:47.617
Come on, Chris.

40:47.617 --> 40:50.965
Come on, don't fucking leave
me down here without you.

40:50.965 --> 40:52.346
Come on, please.

40:57.316 --> 40:59.146
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

40:59.146 --> 41:01.459
Come on. Fuck.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.737
Please, Chris. Please.

41:03.737 --> 41:05.566
Come on. Come on.

41:05.566 --> 41:06.740
Breathe, dammit.

41:06.740 --> 41:08.293
Breathe!

41:08.293 --> 41:09.570
Come on, Chris.

41:09.570 --> 41:10.502
Come on.

41:17.405 --> 41:18.786
Fuck.

41:20.926 --> 41:22.134
Come on.

41:22.134 --> 41:24.205
Come on, come on, just breathe.

41:24.205 --> 41:25.310
Just breathe!

41:26.518 --> 41:27.968
You're all right.
You're all right.

41:27.968 --> 41:32.869
You're all right.

41:32.869 --> 41:34.353
Jim!

41:36.494 --> 41:39.773
You're all right.

41:55.409 --> 41:57.549
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

41:58.585 --> 42:00.552
It's okay, we made it.

42:06.247 --> 42:08.008
It's okay. It's okay.

42:23.023 --> 42:24.576
Hey.
- Yeah, thanks.

42:28.407 --> 42:30.237
O'Connell's dead.

42:30.237 --> 42:31.583
See for yourself if you want to,

42:31.583 --> 42:33.343
he's floating in
between the doors.

42:33.343 --> 42:36.381
The whole front of the
sub is underwater.

42:36.381 --> 42:37.347
Are you sure?

42:37.347 --> 42:38.245
Well, unless he
went for a swim.

42:38.245 --> 42:38.970
Well, you thought
Chris was dead,

42:38.970 --> 42:40.592
look how that turned out.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.594
Hey, I'm not the one who fell
into the fucking pressure lock.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.631
She wasn't breathing,
how was I to know?

42:44.631 --> 42:46.218
That we should all
just be grateful

42:46.218 --> 42:47.599
that any of us are still alive.

42:47.599 --> 42:48.600
Fuck!

42:51.396 --> 42:53.260
How long till we're back
on the surface, Gordon?

42:58.196 --> 43:01.406
Well, kids, can't
say for sure.

43:01.406 --> 43:03.304
We've taken on a fuck
ton of water.

43:03.304 --> 43:04.996
Hank said not to
smoke in here.

43:06.998 --> 43:08.275
Do you want one, Jim?

43:09.863 --> 43:11.243
Help yourself.

43:11.243 --> 43:13.418
We'll smoke in his memory.

43:15.696 --> 43:17.733
How long can we survive
like this down here?

43:19.217 --> 43:22.530
We've got three more
hours of life support left.

43:22.530 --> 43:24.394
Can't see it taking us
more than two hours

43:24.394 --> 43:26.293
to get to the surface.

43:26.293 --> 43:28.088
But I can't be sure.

43:28.088 --> 43:30.538
The longer we're down
here, the heavier we get,

43:30.538 --> 43:32.402
the slower we ascend.

43:32.402 --> 43:33.541
Three hours seems tight.

43:33.541 --> 43:35.060
It is tight,

43:35.060 --> 43:37.925
but there's nothing
more I can do about it.

43:37.925 --> 43:40.203
Let's hope there's no
more nasty surprises.

43:47.245 --> 43:48.660
It's the tissue sample.

43:59.567 --> 44:01.569
Do you hear them, Jim?

44:01.569 --> 44:03.951
Calling to us...

44:03.951 --> 44:05.919
God's of the deep...

44:05.919 --> 44:09.336
Howling to be perceived
by human minds.

44:16.723 --> 44:18.690
This tiny specimen,

44:19.898 --> 44:22.349
it's going to change
everything we know.

44:22.349 --> 44:24.903
Everything we ever
thought we knew.

44:26.387 --> 44:27.388
Don't touch it.

44:28.562 --> 44:31.116
We need to get this down
to the lab and isolate it.

44:31.116 --> 44:33.947
Quickly now, before it
deteriorates.

44:33.947 --> 44:35.673
Maybe we should seal
it in the pressure lock.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.606
No, I want this preserved
properly in the lab.

44:38.606 --> 44:40.678
Pickman, this is something
that hasn't been out

44:40.678 --> 44:43.059
of the water for
millions of years,

44:43.059 --> 44:44.958
we have no idea what
we're exposing ourselves

44:44.958 --> 44:46.373
to by bringing this on board.

44:46.373 --> 44:49.100
Ms. Harris, do you
really think you came

44:49.100 --> 44:52.690
all the way down here
just to look at it?

44:52.690 --> 44:54.864
We didn't know we were
collecting living tissue.

44:54.864 --> 44:58.316
So many answers await us, Jim.

44:58.316 --> 45:00.594
I don't have time to waste.

45:12.779 --> 45:14.194
Careful, Joseph.

45:25.032 --> 45:26.171
Where you going?

45:26.171 --> 45:28.035
We can't stop them
examining that thing,

45:28.035 --> 45:29.105
so someone who knows
what they're doing

45:29.105 --> 45:30.106
should go supervise,

45:30.106 --> 45:31.729
make sure they keep
it contained.

45:35.802 --> 45:37.562
Three hours, Jim.

45:37.562 --> 45:38.632
I suggest you go with them

45:38.632 --> 45:40.392
and make sure they do
nothing stupid.

45:41.566 --> 45:43.602
I've not seen Pickman
like this since...

45:45.259 --> 45:46.433
A long time.

45:46.433 --> 45:48.124
He's not thinking straight.

45:48.124 --> 45:50.161
I don't know if any of
us are anymore.

45:57.133 --> 45:58.617
<i>DP control,</i>

45:58.617 --> 46:00.136
we are a little
under three hours

46:00.136 --> 46:01.620
from the surface.

46:01.620 --> 46:04.244
The tissue sample is
securely aboard.

46:04.244 --> 46:05.693
We've got one casualty.

46:06.867 --> 46:08.835
<i>O'Connell didn't make it.</i>

46:13.667 --> 46:18.258
It seems like it's
mostly adipose tissue.

46:18.258 --> 46:19.604
Body fat.

46:21.054 --> 46:22.365
This is a big piece you took.

46:22.365 --> 46:23.435
Yeah, no surprise it tried

46:23.435 --> 46:25.334
to knock us halfway
across the ocean.

46:27.405 --> 46:29.994
Totally disconnected
from the body...

46:31.892 --> 46:33.894
But still reactive.

46:35.413 --> 46:38.278
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it.

46:38.278 --> 46:41.384
Imagine what we could learn
from an organism like this.

46:41.384 --> 46:42.489
The flesh that still lives on

46:42.489 --> 46:44.629
after it's been severed
from the body.

46:44.629 --> 46:48.219
Oh, it still thinks it's
part of the sea beast.

46:49.565 --> 46:51.843
I think that it senses us.

46:51.843 --> 46:53.189
And I say we leave it
the hell alone

46:53.189 --> 46:55.813
and wait 'til it's safely
back at the research base.

46:55.813 --> 46:59.609
Hank built this so we
could do immediate research.

46:59.609 --> 47:01.335
Well, unexpected things
happen when we mess

47:01.335 --> 47:02.750
with stuff we don't understand.

47:02.750 --> 47:05.926
And how do you know this
thing will still be moving,

47:05.926 --> 47:09.516
active, secreting
slime like it is

47:09.516 --> 47:11.207
once we get it back
to the surface?

47:11.207 --> 47:12.346
Guys.

47:12.346 --> 47:14.141
If you don't mind,
I'll take my chances.

47:14.141 --> 47:15.142
Jim.

47:18.663 --> 47:19.698
Whoa.

47:31.779 --> 47:33.712
Chris, get away from it.

47:33.712 --> 47:35.576
It knows we're here.

47:36.612 --> 47:37.855
Can't we freeze it?

47:37.855 --> 47:39.891
I think we pissed
it off enough already.

47:42.549 --> 47:43.826
Pickman, Jim's right.

47:44.689 --> 47:46.864
We need to keep this contained.
We should seal the lab,

47:46.864 --> 47:48.279
we have no idea what
we're dealing with.

47:48.279 --> 47:50.453
I'm paying you to be the
biologist here.

47:50.453 --> 47:53.663
I am not risking someone
else's life for this expedition.

47:53.663 --> 47:55.079
The science trip is over.

47:56.735 --> 47:59.877
Jim, get him out of here and
help me lock this place up.

48:03.708 --> 48:04.743
You heard her.

49:08.773 --> 49:09.981
Dr. Goldstein.

49:09.981 --> 49:12.466
<i>Joseph, tell me the
specimen is secure.</i>

49:12.466 --> 49:14.365
It's been contained in
the onboard lab,

49:14.365 --> 49:16.436
Pickman's already running tests.

49:16.436 --> 49:17.609
I think you're gonna be
very satisfied.

49:17.609 --> 49:19.128
<i>I hope so.</i>

49:19.128 --> 49:22.200
<i>Don't underestimate the
value of that tissue sample,</i>

49:22.200 --> 49:24.375
<i>protect it with your life,</i>

49:24.375 --> 49:26.411
<i>because if it doesn't make
it back to the surface--</i>

49:26.411 --> 49:29.069
Lady, if that sample doesn't
make it back, neither do I.

49:29.069 --> 49:30.346
And believe me,

49:30.346 --> 49:32.555
that tuna chunk will be
the least of my worries.

49:32.555 --> 49:33.832
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

49:33.832 --> 49:36.870
<i>As long as that specimen
is delivered to me,</i>

49:36.870 --> 49:39.045
<i>your safety is guaranteed.</i>

49:39.045 --> 49:40.149
And the deal's the
same as before.

49:40.149 --> 49:41.254
<i>Correct.</i>

49:41.254 --> 49:44.188
Well then, we are
crystal clear, babe.

49:44.188 --> 49:46.155
And I'm already taking
the necessary precautions.

49:48.571 --> 49:49.848
Pickman's gonna be pissed.

49:49.848 --> 49:52.575
<i>Pickman isn't
interested in riches.</i>

49:52.575 --> 49:55.130
Well then, his loss
is our gain.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.580
<i>Keep me
updated.</i>

51:33.538 --> 51:36.369
Something's not right here,
Chris.

51:36.369 --> 51:38.819
There's some strange feeling...

51:38.819 --> 51:39.924
I don't know.

51:39.924 --> 51:42.892
Just try to relax,
it's nearly over.

51:42.892 --> 51:43.962
We've been down here God
knows how long,

51:43.962 --> 51:45.136
and no one's ever
been this deep.

51:45.136 --> 51:46.931
Yeah, but maybe we were
never meant to come here.

51:46.931 --> 51:49.589
You know, maybe nature never
intended us to find this place.

51:49.589 --> 51:51.936
Don't get hysterical on me,
Jim.

51:51.936 --> 51:53.386
Have you seen
anything down here?

51:53.386 --> 51:54.904
You know, heard anything?

51:54.904 --> 51:56.768
Things you shouldn't see,
things that couldn't be here?

51:56.768 --> 51:57.769
Like what?

51:57.769 --> 51:58.908
None of this was
meant to be here.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.013
Well, like when you went
into the water,

52:00.013 --> 52:01.428
why did you do that?

52:01.428 --> 52:02.636
Because you saw something, right?

52:02.636 --> 52:03.741
Something made you do it?

52:03.741 --> 52:04.707
No, I fell.

52:04.707 --> 52:05.777
No, you saw something,

52:05.777 --> 52:07.331
you, you, you chased after it,

52:07.331 --> 52:09.333
like, like Sam floating
in the water.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.783
No. Jim, what's
wrong with you?

52:11.783 --> 52:14.027
Look, when I was out there,

52:14.027 --> 52:16.581
I thought I heard my
dad over the intercom.

52:16.581 --> 52:18.135
His tapes, his, his
old recordings,

52:18.135 --> 52:19.515
they were playing at the
bottom of the fucking ocean.

52:19.515 --> 52:20.758
How can that be possible?

52:20.758 --> 52:24.002
Listen to me, you didn't
hear anything, okay?

52:24.002 --> 52:24.934
You panicked.

52:24.934 --> 52:26.350
We're all shocked. It's normal.

52:27.454 --> 52:29.353
I don't think any of
this is normal.

52:30.595 --> 52:32.390
I just know I wanna get home.

52:32.390 --> 52:35.600
We will, but I need you
to keep it together, okay?

52:38.016 --> 52:39.017
I need you.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.573
Help keep me sane until
we're back on the surface.

52:43.436 --> 52:44.506
I can't do this alone.

52:45.645 --> 52:47.474
We came to the bottom
of the ocean,

52:48.510 --> 52:50.408
none of us were ever
entirely sane.

52:55.241 --> 52:57.243
You did great out there.

52:57.243 --> 52:59.210
Your dad could never bring
back this physical proof

52:59.210 --> 53:01.454
of things that people
didn't believe existed.

53:03.110 --> 53:05.285
This is gonna shock the world,
Jim.

53:05.285 --> 53:06.804
You lived up to your name.

53:09.255 --> 53:10.256
Yeah, well...

53:11.498 --> 53:13.466
I worry that might not
be a good thing.

53:17.815 --> 53:19.506
We're two hours
from the surface.

53:19.506 --> 53:21.094
Do you copy, DP control?

53:23.476 --> 53:25.271
Come in, DP control.

53:27.134 --> 53:28.653
<i>It's October 25th,</i>

53:29.309 --> 53:31.794
<i>day three of the
Peters-Pickman expedition</i>

53:31.794 --> 53:34.107
<i>to the Antarctic Peninsula.</i>

53:34.107 --> 53:37.144
<i>40 miles into the mountains,</i>

53:37.144 --> 53:41.218
<i>we've uncovered something
extraordinary.</i>

53:42.805 --> 53:45.049
<i>Can't you hear that?</i>

53:45.049 --> 53:48.121
<i>It's speaking to us...</i>

53:48.880 --> 53:50.054
<i>Communicating.</i>

53:53.851 --> 53:55.508
What's happening out there?

53:55.508 --> 53:57.268
Wait, Chris! hang on!

53:57.268 --> 53:59.132
Come on!

54:03.895 --> 54:05.828
- Gordon!
- Gordon!

54:11.765 --> 54:12.766
Christine!

54:27.540 --> 54:28.575
Oh my God.

55:02.609 --> 55:03.507
No!

55:07.649 --> 55:09.098
Jim, get it open!

55:12.999 --> 55:14.000
I can't.

55:15.001 --> 55:17.693
Get him out of there now!

55:17.693 --> 55:19.350
Hold on.

55:26.909 --> 55:29.084
Chris, get out of the way.

55:38.645 --> 55:39.681
Come on!

55:40.785 --> 55:42.200
Put down the ax, Jim!

55:42.200 --> 55:43.167
Pickman's in there!

55:43.167 --> 55:44.375
That's
Pickman's problem.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.066
You're not really gonna
use that thing, Joe.

55:46.066 --> 55:47.723
You open those pressure
doors, this ship fills

55:47.723 --> 55:49.553
with water at a rate
so fucking fast

55:49.553 --> 55:51.624
the liquid will cut your
bodies in two.

55:51.624 --> 55:52.556
Drop it!

55:54.558 --> 55:56.870
What, you just gonna
let Pickman die in there?

55:56.870 --> 55:58.562
Pickman's lost his
fucking mind.

55:58.562 --> 55:59.735
Don't you get it?

55:59.735 --> 56:02.220
This was his dream, to
see those creatures,

56:02.220 --> 56:03.981
those ancient sea gods.

56:03.981 --> 56:05.051
And if that's what he wants,

56:05.051 --> 56:07.225
I do not need to go
down with him.

56:07.225 --> 56:09.780
He didn't even know these
things were down here.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.057
Pickman knew.

56:12.196 --> 56:13.439
He knew what they were,

56:14.232 --> 56:16.234
and he knew they were
only sleeping.

56:18.409 --> 56:19.514
Exactly.

56:20.825 --> 56:23.414
What do you think they
found down in Antarctica?

56:23.414 --> 56:25.071
What do you think they've
been searching

56:25.071 --> 56:26.417
for all these years?

56:26.417 --> 56:28.246
And he just let us
wake them up.

56:28.246 --> 56:30.490
Pickman did not spend
all of this money

56:30.490 --> 56:32.975
for you two to have the
adventure of a lifetime.

56:32.975 --> 56:35.564
We were sent here with a
clear objective.

56:35.564 --> 56:37.980
Get the tissue sample
from the fucking water goblins,

56:37.980 --> 56:39.326
make it back to the surface,

56:39.326 --> 56:41.432
and get filthy, fucking rich.

56:41.432 --> 56:44.124
So will you please
both move away

56:44.124 --> 56:46.506
from the fucking pressure doors!

56:46.506 --> 56:48.646
You think that specimen's
gonna make you rich?

56:48.646 --> 56:49.992
It's gonna be harder
than you think.

56:49.992 --> 56:53.030
Oh, you think I'm scared
of a couple of brainiacs?

56:53.030 --> 56:56.205
No, that thing is growing.

56:56.205 --> 56:58.449
You can go and look at it
if you don't believe me.

56:58.449 --> 57:00.589
And I think it's having a
strange psychological effect

57:00.589 --> 57:01.521
on our crew.

57:01.521 --> 57:03.454
Oh, you fucking think.

57:03.454 --> 57:06.112
It doesn't just
exist physically,

57:06.112 --> 57:08.701
it's in our minds,
it's in our thoughts.

57:09.736 --> 57:12.981
Joe, I don't know if
you know this,

57:13.844 --> 57:16.812
but I have a son waiting
for me back home.

57:16.812 --> 57:19.401
He's 10 months old, and if
I don't get back to him,

57:20.333 --> 57:22.680
if I don't see him again,

57:22.680 --> 57:25.062
I swear to fucking God,

57:25.062 --> 57:26.857
you'll die down here with me,

57:26.857 --> 57:28.168
and it won't be pretty.

57:29.756 --> 57:32.034
I don't need to listen
to this bullshit.

57:34.347 --> 57:36.280
Wait, don't agitate him.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.730
- Jim!
- He's dangerous, Chris.

57:37.730 --> 57:39.214
There's nothing we can do.

58:41.690 --> 58:43.002
Gordon?

58:43.002 --> 58:44.728
<i>It's from the sea,</i>

58:44.728 --> 58:48.145
<i>frozen in time and
waiting for the thaw.</i>

58:49.629 --> 58:53.633
Jim, my boy, is it really you?

58:53.633 --> 58:55.117
Gordon, maybe you should
come downstairs

58:55.117 --> 58:56.947
and lie down for a while.

58:56.947 --> 58:59.777
I always knew you would
find me one day, Jimmy.

59:01.227 --> 59:03.263
They told me you would come,

59:03.263 --> 59:08.406
but I prayed, I prayed
that it wasn't true.

59:12.134 --> 59:14.585
Don't be afraid, Jimmy.

59:14.585 --> 59:17.864
Death is not the end.

59:17.864 --> 59:21.488
These are things I
should never have known,

59:21.488 --> 59:24.526
things of nature never
intended us to find.

59:25.596 --> 59:28.012
Sit down, Gordon.

59:28.012 --> 59:29.635
I don't think that's
Gordon anymore.

59:29.635 --> 59:32.672
Show them, Jimmy.
Show them the way home,

59:32.672 --> 59:35.813
back to their place
they once knew.

59:41.129 --> 59:44.650
None of this insignificant race

59:44.650 --> 59:48.619
will know how I tried
to warn them,

59:48.619 --> 59:50.621
how they left it, too late.

59:50.621 --> 59:53.313
Get the fuck away from me,
Gordon.

59:53.313 --> 59:54.521
Don't make me use this.

59:54.521 --> 59:59.596
When they awake, it
is time for us to sleep.

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:26.243
Jim!

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.491
Gordon!

01:00:44.364 --> 01:00:46.297
That's it, w- we've lost them.

01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:48.575
I can't get a signal,
there's nothing.

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:02.693
Gordon!

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:14.981
Move!

01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:25.336
Gordon?

01:01:28.546 --> 01:01:29.616
What have you done?

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.771
Joe, stop, you'll
blow the windows!

01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:47.082
Joe, what are you doing?

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:49.119
This thing's going down,
sweetheart,

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:50.603
back down to the bottom
of the ocean,

01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:52.881
only I'm not going down with it.

01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.503
You can't just leave
us to pilot this thing.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:55.712
Pilot what?

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.783
It's scrap metal, lady,
open your fucking eyes!

01:01:57.783 --> 01:01:59.957
This thing is going down!

01:02:02.615 --> 01:02:04.030
I'm sorry about your kid.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.052
Now you wanna fight me now, bitch.

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:27.329
Try it.

01:02:58.326 --> 01:03:00.638
You think we're just
gonna let you walk out

01:03:00.638 --> 01:03:01.881
of here, bitch?

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.815
No, I don't.

01:03:20.451 --> 01:03:21.418
Jim!

01:03:24.214 --> 01:03:25.491
Are you okay?

01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:26.664
I'll live.

01:03:26.664 --> 01:03:28.321
Okay.

01:03:29.426 --> 01:03:30.599
Get in the rover,
we've gotta go.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:31.738
What?

01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:32.912
Get in the rover!

01:03:32.912 --> 01:03:34.603
- Where's Joe?
- Oh, screw Joe!

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.329
Come on, we gotta go!

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.330
Okay, wait for me
here, I'll be a second.

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:21.745
What? Where are you going?

01:05:21.745 --> 01:05:23.436
We can't risk someone
else finding it.

01:05:23.436 --> 01:05:25.162
You know they'll come looking.

01:05:47.564 --> 01:05:49.669
All right, whatever the
hell you are,

01:05:49.669 --> 01:05:51.982
time to make calamari.

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:34.680
<i>Better hurry, Jimmy.</i>

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.615
<i>Five minutes until this whole
thing goes under. [laughs]</i>

01:06:39.478 --> 01:06:44.345
<i>This whole things gonna blow
when that door opens. [laughs]</i>

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.900
<i>Implode! [laughing]</i>

01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:08.403
Jim, we don't have
enough air supply.

01:07:08.403 --> 01:07:10.681
And that door's set
to open in five minutes.

01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:12.062
This whole thing's
gonna implode.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.132
- What?
- One of us needs

01:07:13.132 --> 01:07:14.858
to stay behind to seal
the pressure lock.

01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:16.204
Go on without me.

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:17.343
No, Jim, we always said we--

01:07:17.343 --> 01:07:18.413
Just go!

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:20.036
No, Jim!

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:23.073
No!

01:07:35.913 --> 01:07:37.467
You going somewhere?

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.058
Jim!

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:50.928
Hey!

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.258
You can't destroy them, Jimmy.

01:08:10.258 --> 01:08:13.779
We woke them up,
and now it's all over.

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.282
Jim.

01:10:19.629 --> 01:10:21.458
Come find me, son.

01:10:54.008 --> 01:10:57.736
Jim, you came for me.

01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:02.085
Let's go together...

01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:07.124
Together with them into
the depths of oblivion.

01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:09.782
Dad?

01:11:36.809 --> 01:11:37.948
Ms. Harris?

01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:41.331
Ms. Harris, can you hear me?

01:11:42.608 --> 01:11:43.782
It's okay, you're safe.

01:11:43.782 --> 01:11:45.370
We're looking after you now.

01:11:46.854 --> 01:11:48.165
Jim?

01:11:48.165 --> 01:11:50.582
Providence!

01:11:50.582 --> 01:11:52.377
They've gone. Ms. Harris.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:54.827
After communication was lost,

01:11:54.827 --> 01:11:57.140
we picked up your rover signal.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.693
They found you drifting.

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:01.627
Your oxygen levels were
dangerously low.

01:12:01.627 --> 01:12:05.528
You've been unconscious
for a couple of days.

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:07.253
You killed them.

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:08.910
You knew exactly what we
were going into,

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.843
you fucking knew that!
- Ms. Harris, calm down!

01:12:10.843 --> 01:12:13.018
Ms. Harris, please, relax!

01:12:13.018 --> 01:12:14.399
Please!
- Neither of us got

01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:16.366
what we wanted, did we?

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:18.023
You knew the risks.

01:12:18.023 --> 01:12:19.921
No one must know what happened.

01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:21.578
Ahh!!!

01:12:21.578 --> 01:12:23.615
- Ms. Harris, calm down!
- Ahh!!!

01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:25.375
What's wrong with her?

01:12:40.597 --> 01:12:41.633
Oh no.

01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:42.875
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:45.084
No!

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.880
Congratulations, bitch,
you got exactly

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.882
what you fucking wanted!

01:12:53.092 --> 01:12:54.577
No! No!
