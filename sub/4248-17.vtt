11:33.192 --> 11:33.818
- COME ON!

11:33.901 --> 11:35.778
WHAT'S THE BIG MYSTERY?

11:35.861 --> 11:39.240
WHY IS RUFUS AFTER JOY,
AND WHERE IS SHE?

11:39.323 --> 11:41.700
TELL ME, OR I'M GOING GLOBAL.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.994
- DON'T THREATEN ME, PATRICIA.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.789
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.042
- DON'T THREATEN ME, DAPHNE.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.919
I'M ALREADY IN IT.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.508
- RIGHT.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.844
NOW, HAVE YOU GOT EVERYTHING?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.178
- YEAH.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.222
- WHERE IS THAT TAXI?

12:03.305 --> 12:04.682
I'LL JUST GIVE THEM
ANOTHER RING.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.145
- ALL SET, THEN?

12:09.228 --> 12:12.940
- UM...
YEAH.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.693
- NO TWINKLY LEOTARDS IN THERE?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.279
- NO, ALTHOUGH I DO WANT
TO STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.489
[laughs nervously]

12:20.573 --> 12:22.992
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOOD LUCK.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.326
- THANKS.
I'M GONNA NEED IT.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.496
- NO, YOU WON'T.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.539
[horn honks]

12:28.622 --> 12:30.541
- OH, I THINK THAT'S FOR ME.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.544
- OH!
IS THAT YOUR TAXI?

12:33.627 --> 12:34.003
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.797
- OH!

12:36.881 --> 12:39.258
BYE, MY LOVELY.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.594
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.307
OH, I'LL JUST TELL HIM TO WAIT.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.146
- BYE, THEN, MARA.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.107
- YEAH, BYE.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.693
- SORRY TO GATE-CRASH
YOUR TENDER GOOD-BYE.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.820
- WE JUST WANTED
TO WISH YOU GOOD LUCK, DUDE.

13:01.197 --> 13:01.822
- SOCK IT TO 'EM.

13:01.906 --> 13:02.865
- OH, CHEERS. WILL DO.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.252
- DO YOU THINK
I OVERSTEPPED THE MARK,

13:15.336 --> 13:18.088
DEMANDING ANSWERS?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.257
- NO, YOU WERE AMAZING.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.594
- WHO'S READY
TO BRING THESE SUCKERS DOWN?

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
- SIBUNA.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.722
all: SIBUNA.

13:26.805 --> 13:31.060
- OKAY, SETTLE DOWN,
QUICKLY, PLEASE.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.853
THANK YOU.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.232
NOW, IT HAS COME
TO OUR ATTENTION

13:36.315 --> 13:39.026
THAT SOME OF YOU
ARE NOT AS OCCUPIED

13:39.109 --> 13:41.195
AS YOU MIGHT LIKE
OUTSIDE OF CLASS.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.240
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
BRING ON THE NEW GIRLS, MISS.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.951
- SO WE'VE DECIDED
TO RUN ELECTIONS

13:47.034 --> 13:48.744
FOR A SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVE.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.621
- WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?

13:50.704 --> 13:52.039
- THE SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVE

13:52.122 --> 13:53.499
WOULD BE AN AMBASSADOR
FOR THE SCHOOL

13:53.582 --> 13:56.252
AND WOULD ALSO ACT AS A CONDUIT

13:56.335 --> 14:00.047
FOR RELATIONS
BETWEEN STAFF AND STUDENTS.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.467
YES, PATRICIA?

14:03.551 --> 14:06.929
- I DON'T LIKE THE
SCHOOL REP IDEA, MRS. ANDREWS.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.516
BUT I MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN STARTING A SCHOOL PAPER,

14:10.599 --> 14:14.853
THE GOSSIP, THE NEWS,
THE SCANDAL, THE TRUTH.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.355
WHAT DO YOU RECKON?

14:16.438 --> 14:18.065
- I THINK YOU'LL FIND, PATRICIA,

14:18.148 --> 14:21.777
THAT THAT LITTLE MATTER
IS ALREADY IN HAND.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.947
NOW, ABOUT THE SCHOOL
REPRESENTATIVE.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.077
- DO YOU THINK
MICK'S FEELING NERVOUS?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.829
I WONDER WHEN HE'LL GET THERE.

14:31.912 --> 14:32.246
PATRICIA?

14:32.329 --> 14:34.039
- WHAT?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.708
- I SAID--
- I'M SORRY.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.375
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
AND TALK TO THOSE GUYS.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.919
SORRY, MARA.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.630
- AW, MICK'S AWAY, AND MARA'S
GOT NO ONE TO PLAY WITH.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.674
MARA, YOU CAN HANG WITH US
IF YOU LIKE.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.636
- NO, THANKS.
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.013
- "BRING IN THE NEW GIRLS,
MISS."

14:49.096 --> 14:50.931
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH THE OLD ONES.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.141
- WHAT, MARA?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.392
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.312
NO, SHE'S THE ICE QUEEN,
ICY QUEEN OF ICE.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.813
- BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE MEANT

14:57.896 --> 14:59.481
BY THE MATTER BEING IN HAND?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.526
- YOU ARE TO COME WITH ME

15:02.610 --> 15:04.111
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.866
- WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.159
WHAT IF THEY STUFF US IN A HOLE

15:10.242 --> 15:13.579
WITH NO FOOD OR DRINK OR MASCARA
FOR 62 DAYS?

15:13.662 --> 15:16.415
OH, WAIT FOR ME.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.170
- YOUR TURN NOW, SWEETHEART.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.796
VERY QUIET TODAY.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.382
VERY QUIET EVERY DAY.
[laughs]

15:28.719 --> 15:31.430
OH, YOU LOT LOOK TERRIBLE.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.931
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

15:33.015 --> 15:34.141
DRAGGING THEM HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

15:34.224 --> 15:36.477
- DON'T LET US KEEP YOU
FROM YOUR DUTIES, TRUDY.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.187
SUPERMARKET, YES?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.064
COME, COME, MY OFFICE.
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.485
OFF YOU GO, TRUDY.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.528
DON'T WANT TO FIRE YOU AGAIN.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
ONCE A TERM IS QUITE ENOUGH.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.417
- [gasping]

16:00.501 --> 16:03.337
- PATRICIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.589
WE NEED A PAPER BAG.
WE NEED A PAPER BAG!

16:05.673 --> 16:07.174
- I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BREATHE.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.967
I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.636
LET ME OUT!

16:10.719 --> 16:12.096
- VICTOR, YOU HEARD HER.
LET HER OUT.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.263
- ME TOO!

16:13.347 --> 16:14.473
I'M TOO YOUNG
AND TOO PRETTY TO DIE.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.683
- LET ME OUT!

16:15.766 --> 16:16.934
LET ME OUT!

16:17.017 --> 16:17.601
- YOU WANTED ANSWERS.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.604
WELL, HERE THEY ARE.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.564
- PATRICIA?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.316
PATRICIA, ARE YOU THERE?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.318
- JOY.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.237
JOY.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.660
- [laughs lightly]
TYPICAL.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.078
- PROBLEM?

16:36.161 --> 16:39.081
- NO, IT'S JUST A CARD
FROM MY PARENTS

16:39.164 --> 16:40.708
WISHING ME LUCK FOR THE PLAY.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.334
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GOT A CARD.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.588
- I DON'T THINK I EVER MET
YOUR PARENTS, JEROME.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.133
- THAT'LL PROBABLY BE BECAUSE
THEY NEVER ACTUALLY VISIT.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.137
- OW!

16:53.220 --> 16:54.263
- [laughs]

16:54.346 --> 16:55.514
[laughter]

16:55.597 --> 16:57.015
- JEROME, YOU'RE MEANT
TO BE HELPING ME

16:57.099 --> 16:58.183
WITH MY B-BOY MOVES.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.478
I'VE ALMOST CRACKED
THE CATERPILLAR.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.814
- [laughs]

17:03.897 --> 17:05.898
"ALMOST" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.318
- DON'T YOU SEE THEM
IN THE HOLIDAYS, THEN?

17:10.319 --> 17:12.364
- ANYWAY, LOOK,
I'VE GOT TO GO.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.866
- HEY, JEROME,
I NEED YOU TO HOLD MY LEGS

17:13.949 --> 17:14.907
FOR THE JACKHAMMER.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.326
- SORRY, JEROME.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.368
DID I SAY SOMETHING?

17:17.453 --> 17:21.457
- NO, JUST PLACES TO GO,
PEOPLE TO SEE.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.503
- I GOT YOUR CARD, JOY.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.881
I CAME TO FIND YOU, BUT YOU--

17:28.964 --> 17:29.673
- THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME MEET YOU.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.092
TOO DANGEROUS.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.053
- HEY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.180
SO WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

17:42.394 --> 17:43.479
- HEY, IS THAT AMBER?

17:43.562 --> 17:46.523
- HEY, JOY, I HAVE SO MUCH
TO TELL YOU.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.318
MICK AND I SPLIT UP,
AND HE'S TOTALLY DEVASTATED

17:49.401 --> 17:50.652
BUT PRETENDING NOT TO BE.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.906
AND NINA STARTED THE SCHOOL.
SHE'S AMERICAN.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.659
- HI, I'M NINA
FROM AMERICA.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.827
- HI.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.078
SO YOU'RE THE NEW ME.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.207
- UM, WELL, SORT OF.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.834
SO DO YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHERE YOU ARE?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.169
- NO, SHE DOES NOT.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.591
- AND FABIAN'S HERE.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.717
- HEY, JOY.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.844
- FABES.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.679
HI.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.640
- SO WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.354
- I'M NOT.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.814
- WHAT?
WHY NOT?

18:26.897 --> 18:29.358
- I CAN'T SAY TOO MUCH,

18:29.441 --> 18:31.443
BUT MY DAD SAYS
THERE'S SOMEONE AFTER US,

18:31.527 --> 18:34.363
SO WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY
AND CHANGE OUR NAMES AND STUFF.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.906
- RUFUS.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.284
- I'M STILL YOUR BEST FRIEND,
PATRICIA,

18:39.368 --> 18:40.869
AND I ALWAYS WILL BE,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.288
BUT IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS
FOR ME TO BE THERE ANYMORE.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.624
- OFF THE CAM NOW, PLEASE,
PRINCESS.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.042
- GUYS, I HAVE TO GO,
BUT LISTEN.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.710
VICTOR AND THE OTHER TEACHERS--

18:48.794 --> 18:50.128
- JOY.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.383
- THEY'RE PROTECTING ME.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.555
YOU CAN TRUST THEM, OKAY?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.140
- JOY, DON'T GO.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.600
I MISS YOU.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.520
- I MISS YOU TOO.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.772
BYE.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.900
- HAPPY NOW?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.736
- BUT WHY IS RUFUS AFTER JOY?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.531
- HE'S NOT AFTER JOY.
HE'S AFTER ME.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.411
- HELLO, PATRICIA.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.745
- MR. MERCER.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.414
- I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.625
ZENO IS AFTER SOME TOP-SECRET
INFORMATION

19:28.709 --> 19:29.751
WHICH WE CANNOT LET HIM HAVE.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.212
IT'S A MATTER
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.339
[sighs]

19:34.423 --> 19:37.092
SORRY, BUT THAT'S ALL
I CAN TELL YOU AT THE MOMENT.

19:37.175 --> 19:39.595
- VERY WELL, BOYS AND GIRLS.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.014
LET'S WRAP IT UP NOW.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.019
AND THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.272
FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE TO GO
STRAIGHT TO SCHOOL

19:50.355 --> 19:53.442
AND THEN DIRECTLY
BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTERWARDS.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.111
NO ONE IS TO GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.613
RUFUS ZENO IS STILL OUT THERE.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.907
NOW GO.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.874
- I CAN'T BELIEVE VICTOR'S
PUT US UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.918
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.794
HE HAS SUCH EVIL HAIR.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.464
- BUT IS HE GOOD, THOUGH,
REALLY?

20:15.547 --> 20:17.174
- YES, YOU HEARD JOY.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.843
- AT LEAST WE KNOW JOY IS SAFE.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.386
- IT'S PRETTY SCARY, THOUGH,

20:21.470 --> 20:24.306
HAVING TO REINVENT YOURSELF
TO GET RUFUS OFF YOUR BACK.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.933
- SHE'S MILES AWAY, PATRICIA.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.976
HE CAN'T GET TO HER NOW.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.770
- IT'S NOT HER
I WAS THINKING OF.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.273
- GUYS, WAIT.
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.528
- VICTOR.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.571
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

20:46.453 --> 20:48.163
DO YOU THINK THEY BOUGHT IT?

20:48.246 --> 20:50.249
- YES.
- GOOD.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.835
- BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
ALLOW ANY MORE CONTACT.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.462
- I AGREE.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.340
- AFTER ALL,

20:58.423 --> 21:00.968
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DISTRACT THE CHOSEN ONE

21:01.051 --> 21:04.221
FROM FULFILLING HER DESTINY,
NOW, DO WE?
