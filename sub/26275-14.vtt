WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
Hey. I thought
you left for work.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.975
I'm going in late today.
I got to stop by the pot shop

00:08.008 --> 00:10.044
to go over these P&Ls
with Ryan.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.880
I always forget that place
is just like any other business.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.516
Yeah, I get reminded of that
when I see that Purple Urkel

00:15.549 --> 00:19.353
is outselling Hawaii Five-Yo.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.689
I remember
when it was all just called

00:21.722 --> 00:24.358
"whatever Jill's boyfriend has."
(chuckles)

00:24.392 --> 00:27.328
Uh, so you will like this:

00:27.361 --> 00:30.164
Mandy and Kyle are looking
at apartments today.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.932
You know, they say a man
should never dance

00:31.965 --> 00:36.003
unless he's being shot at,
but this is a special occasion.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.638
(grunts)

00:39.273 --> 00:41.875
Did you hear that?
Like a snap or something.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.545
Dramatic announcement.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.080
We have found
the perfect apartment

00:46.114 --> 00:47.948
-and are probably moving out.
-(sighs)

00:47.981 --> 00:50.251
Darn it.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.019
Hey, cheer up.
This place is close enough

00:52.052 --> 00:53.454
we can still carpool.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.389
D-Darn it.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.625
Well, anyway,
I got to get going.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.627
I'm going by the pot shop.
Honey, you need anything?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.062
Tray pack, nickel bag,
anything like that?

01:02.096 --> 01:04.064
I've got, uh, Purple Urkel.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.101
We got Squeeze Top Honey Bear
or, uh, Lazy Susan?

01:07.135 --> 01:09.237
Uh, you're just naming things
that are on the table.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.972
Actually, Squeeze Top Honey Bear
was my college band.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.842
And I have smoked
a lot of Lazy Susan.

01:16.577 --> 01:20.314
-So, tell me about this place.
-Oh, yeah.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.316
Uh, okay,
it's a two-bedroom apartment.

01:22.350 --> 01:26.320
Cranmer Park, south-facing,
central heating, but no pets.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.322
Yeah, it's perfect
except for the no pets.

01:28.356 --> 01:31.159
We were gonna get a cat, because
Kyle has a laser pointer.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.327
Pew, pew, pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew!

01:35.763 --> 01:39.933
Uh, well, is there parking?
Does it cost extra?

01:39.967 --> 01:43.337
Mm, don't know, don't care.
There's a shared hot tub.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.406
Okay, uh, you know what?
Maybe I should go with you guys.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.940
It might be good to have
someone with experience

01:46.974 --> 01:48.509
to help guide you along.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.844
Oh, cooking classes
and helping with apartments.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.747
You're the best mom
I've ever had.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
Well, your dad and I
have shopped for our share

01:55.549 --> 01:57.918
of apartments, so I do know
the do's and don'ts.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.054
Like do examine the bathroom,
don't use the bathroom.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.158
Okay, I'll be right back.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.361
*

02:12.166 --> 02:14.335
(sighs) I loved everything
about that place.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.204
The closets, the porch...

02:16.237 --> 02:17.838
Yeah, and that-that little
hidden ironing board

02:17.871 --> 02:20.107
that comes
right out of the wall?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.577
Probably from a time
when ironing was illegal.

02:26.079 --> 02:30.618
You're moving out? Is this house
too beautiful and free for you?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.720
Uh, well, they filled in
an application,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.722
but there were a lot
of other people looking,

02:34.755 --> 02:36.624
so we're-we're not gonna
get our hopes up.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.326
Well, yeah,
but the guy really liked us.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.060
And he laughed so hard
when Kyle asked

02:40.093 --> 02:43.197
why there was a diving board
coming out of the wall.

02:44.398 --> 02:48.068
Yeah, it was a funny joke by me.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.737
I bet everyone who lives there

02:49.770 --> 02:52.306
will call you
that cool young couple upstairs.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.408
(chuckles) No, they'll-they'll
know our names, Jen.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.176
They'll be right there
on the mailbox.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.580
Sorry, gender-neutral box.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.682
And I'm so glad
you came along, Mom.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.151
I didn't realize there were
so many things to ask about.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.520
Well, it's important to know
if there's a diner nearby.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.590
Does the Thai place deliver?
Is the Italian any good?

03:09.623 --> 03:12.660
Yeah, I-I guess I should
have eaten before we went.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.263
Well, now that we know what
we need in the new place,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.730
let's go sort through
our wedding gifts.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.967
Oh. I hope no one gave us food.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.239
Congratulations, you found
your daughter a beautiful home.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.542
The place she will care for you
when you are dying.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.580
Well, it was nice,
but not deathbed nice.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.783
Mandy and Kyle have never looked
for an apartment before.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.218
They were only paying attention
to the good things.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.355
Oh, what a horrible way
to look at life.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.424
(phone ringing)

03:46.460 --> 03:49.430
Hello? Oh, yes,
I'm their reference.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.865
Sure, I'd be happy
to answer any questions.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.302
Uh, but, uh, let me just ask you
a quick thing first.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.904
Uh, the back staircase
is rickety.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.573
I'm sure you have plans
to rebuild it. Oh, no.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.609
No, no, that is
your responsibility.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.777
Oh, and the lights flicker.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.479
You'll need to have
the wiring checked

04:05.513 --> 04:07.748
and-and possibly replaced. Hmm?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.149
Does-doesn't even make sense.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.985
Why would I have
my wiring checked?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.988
Hello? Hello?

04:15.022 --> 04:18.726
(chuckles):
Oh. Hung up.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.928
Well, that may not hurt
their chances.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.730
Maybe everybody else's reference
comes off

04:22.763 --> 04:25.399
like an injury attorney.

04:25.433 --> 04:29.437
I was only asking
the questions they didn't.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.271
Look, if the landlord
can't handle those,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.841
then he's not someone
you want to rent from.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.677
Hey, a wedding gift
I completely forgot about.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.646
An iron.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.982
This place is so meant to be.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.522
Let me guess.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.958
Is there a Snoop Dogg concert
tonight?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.694
Uh, there was last week.
They missed it.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.530
I don't have the heart
to tell them.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.265
Thanks for coming.
I need your opinion.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.868
Who doesn't?
So what's on your mind?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.836
Well, you saw
in the P&L statement

05:02.870 --> 05:04.605
that Bud's Buds
is having a good year.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.006
-Yeah, congratulations.
-Thank you.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.542
And I have an idea
on what to do with the profits.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.210
Oh, boy, here we go.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.446
(Russian accent):
What's on your mind, comrade?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.448
I want to renovate
the upstairs storage area

05:14.482 --> 05:16.550
and turn it
into more retail space.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.986
(regular accent):
Wait just a minute.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.821
That's not a dumb idea.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.224
-I know.
-No, I was expecting
a dumb idea.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.694
-I know. Surprise.
-Wait.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.662
Let me get my head around this.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.664
You want to take your profits

05:30.698 --> 05:33.300
and pour them back
into your business to expand.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.169
(chuckles)
There's a word for that.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.571
Capitalism.

05:37.605 --> 05:41.975
Which makes you a capitalist.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.977
-No. That makes me
a businessman.
-Yeah.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.379
-Mm-mmm.
-And-and not all businessmen...

05:45.413 --> 05:47.014
I am a good person.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.750
Yeah. But in time,
you'll be wearing a monocle

05:49.783 --> 05:52.653
and one of those
big stovepipe hats.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.022
O-Okay.
But by growing the business,

05:55.055 --> 05:56.524
I am creating more jobs,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.592
which helps my employees
and the community.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.494
Hmm. You know what
I'm hearing right now?

06:00.528 --> 06:03.096
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
capitalist."

06:04.364 --> 06:05.733
You know, sorry about the mess,

06:05.766 --> 06:10.203
but the maid died carrying all
my gold bricks into the parlor.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.372
Why don't you stop by
for a game

06:12.406 --> 06:14.341
-of gin rummy at the club?
-Okay.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.176
We'll have some, uh,
lime rickeys

06:16.209 --> 06:17.845
or a gin and tonic.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.714
Ta-ta, everybody!

06:23.216 --> 06:24.518
VANESSA:
No.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.353
No, no,
that was definitely mold.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.856
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I am a scientist,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.758
which brings me to the calcium
buildup in your pipe.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.894
Hel-Hello? Hello?
Hello?

06:33.927 --> 06:36.096
I wonder if landlords
have a message board

06:36.129 --> 06:37.998
where they talk about you.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.301
I was just raising
legitimate safety concerns.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.936
I see.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.574
Did you know, in the 1800s,
French workers disrupted

06:46.607 --> 06:49.743
their own factories
to undermine their bosses?

06:49.777 --> 06:53.146
These workers wore wooden shoes
called sabots,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.049
which is how we got
the word...

06:56.083 --> 06:58.619
"sabotage."

07:00.153 --> 07:01.955
I see what you're getting at.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.791
And what I was doing
was not sabotage.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.460
I was simply looking out
for my daughter.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.261
Of course, Vanessa.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.732
And I was just simply sharing an
interesting fact from history.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.968
-(coughs) Sabotage.
-Hey.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.137
Oh, hey.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.674
Uh, so, um,
how's the apartment hunt going?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.309
It's going bad.
Badly?

07:22.342 --> 07:24.144
It's going terrible.
Terribly?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.579
It ain't good.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.447
KYLE:
Yeah.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.650
We got rejected
from every place we applied.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.685
Oh. Really? Shoot.

07:31.719 --> 07:35.589
-(mouths)
-Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.090
Yeah, at first,
I thought it was my fault.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.093
You know, people find goatees
untrustworthy.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.531
Thanks a lot, Disney villains
and every picture of the devil.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.967
But then we were like, "No,
something else is going on."

07:47.000 --> 07:49.002
And that's when
we figured it out.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.838
Did you know, in the 1800s,
French work...

07:50.871 --> 07:52.940
Nobody likes history, Jen.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.442
See, we were only looking
at really nice apartments.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.145
Places with amenities
like a doorman or a gym.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.780
Or a doorman named Jim.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.482
Uh, and these places
were desirable,

08:02.516 --> 08:04.618
so of course they were going
to be super competitive.

08:04.652 --> 08:08.722
But what we need is a place
that's less desirable.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.358
-What? No, w-wait. No, no, no.
-So we went to look

08:11.391 --> 08:13.360
at these apartments,
and guess what.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.396
They were super excited to take
our application. (chuckles)

08:16.429 --> 08:19.733
Yeah, honey, that-that's because
these places are all dumps.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.369
Yes, exactly. Which means
they won't turn us down.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.804
I-I think some
of these apartments

08:23.837 --> 08:25.806
even rent by the hour.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
Mom, this is just
a starter place.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.843
How long do you think
we'll actually be there?

08:29.877 --> 08:32.012
Three, four thousand hours?

08:32.045 --> 08:33.581
KYLE:
All right. Come on, Mandy.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.549
We should keep looking
while it's still light.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.351
We do not want to be in those
neighborhoods after dark.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.223
I got to make some calls.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.425
This is happening
over my dead body.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.427
And these are the stories
my father doesn't believe

08:47.460 --> 08:49.029
when I write home.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.439
Hello, Mother.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.441
Mother.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.877
It's never good
when they use your full name.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.246
You stabbed me in the back.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.881
You called every one
of those landlords

09:07.915 --> 09:09.950
and complained about how
everything had broken down.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.853
-Dad's got a bum knee,
you gonna throw him out, too?
-No, honey,

09:12.886 --> 09:15.055
no, I'm sorry.
Look, I-I just didn't want

09:15.088 --> 09:17.725
your apartment hunt to turn
into another pork chop incident.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.426
How dare you throw
that back in my face.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.394
You know it's where
it hit me the first time.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.563
Mandy, Mandy, look, I just...

09:23.597 --> 09:25.699
I-I just want you
and Kyle to be safe.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.301
Yeah, Mom, that's not your job.
I'm not a little girl anymore.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.538
My God, I am six feet tall.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.373
Yeah, I know. I know,
and at that last place,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.908
if I hadn't stopped you,
that ceiling fan

09:34.942 --> 09:37.210
would've chopped
your head right off.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.813
You think Kyle and I can't
get by without you and Dad.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.481
-No, that's not it. No...
-Yes, it is, yes.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.116
Y-You think that we're just
these helpless,

09:43.150 --> 09:45.753
-pathetic, beautiful children.
-Mandy.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.487
Honey, no, I know
you're not children.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.922
Then stop treating us like one.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.924
Like two. Like both?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.794
We ain't children.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.564
MAN (over radio):
Thanks for the chat, Mike.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.333
This is AA6RA.
Clear in seven-three.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.804
This is KA0XTT.
Seven-three.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.406
Oh, look at that.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.041
My favorite capitalist.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.814
Nice boots. Perfect for jumping
on the back of the proletariat.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.151
They're fair trade
faux leather boots, Mike.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.353
And unlike your comments,
cruelty-free.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.258
-Can we talk business now?
-Yep, time is money, and I know

10:25.292 --> 10:28.095
how you love money.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.429
Can you just sign these papers?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.264
I need your authorizations
on the applications.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.300
-I already signed these.
-No. These are different.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.969
You signed the authorizations
to get the applications.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.370
These are
supplemental clearances

10:37.404 --> 10:39.639
specific
to marijuana businesses.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.641
Boy, what a headache.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.411
But I'm sure you've got
a product for that.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.382
I'm drowning in codes
and regulations and ordinances.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.885
-Not to mention
all-all these fees.
-Yeah.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.054
I know, it's ridiculous.
I mean, how does the government

10:54.087 --> 10:56.089
think they know more
about my business than I do?

10:59.192 --> 11:02.763
I think what you're asking for
is smaller government.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.700
No. I just want less red tape.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.870
Like I said--
smaller government.

11:09.903 --> 11:13.240
-Huh? Ah? Ah?
-No, I... (stammers)

11:13.273 --> 11:14.541
Huh?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.577
Damn it.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.813
Surprise!

11:19.847 --> 11:22.015
Listen.
First, you're a capitalist.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.184
Now you're griping
about government overreach.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.254
Pretty soon you'll be invited
to a little party.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.556
Don't say it.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.224
The mascot's an elephant.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.061
(groans)
Oh, my God.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.363
Hey, babe. What?
We going to lunch?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.899
Oh, and have people
wait on us? No!

11:40.968 --> 11:42.202
Are you having fun?

11:42.235 --> 11:45.538
More fun than playing polo
and slapping the help.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.375
Thank you for bringing
my lunch, dolly.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.343
Mm-hmm. You know, uh,

11:50.377 --> 11:53.680
this is really torturing him.
Can you just cut him a break?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.348
You kidding? He's been
giving me grief for years

11:55.382 --> 11:58.085
for being a corporate monster.
This is payback,

11:58.118 --> 12:01.889
-with interest, because
I'm a great businessman.
-Mm.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.424
-Exactly. Yes.
-Right, right.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.294
You built Outdoor Man
into a huge chain and...

12:07.327 --> 12:08.728
-Perfect.
-...never once stopped caring

12:08.762 --> 12:10.397
for every single employee.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.399
You run your business

12:12.432 --> 12:14.401
with integrity.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.636
-Oh, man.
-(chuckles)

12:16.669 --> 12:17.971
Going after my ego, aren't you?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.807
Mm.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.041
You're out for blood.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.310
(chuckles)

12:23.343 --> 12:25.245
You are also a great father

12:25.278 --> 12:27.414
and don't like seeing
your daughter unhappy,

12:27.447 --> 12:29.282
so I know that you'll
do the right thing

12:29.316 --> 12:31.151
and explain to Ryan
that he can be

12:31.184 --> 12:32.953
a-a great,
successful businessman

12:32.986 --> 12:35.923
without turning
into the Monopoly guy.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.125
-Hmm?
-Fine.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.827
-I'll tell him.
-Okay.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.796
While I'm hunting humans
on my private island.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.968
Man: the most dangerous prey.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.239
JEN:
So,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.007
I've been thinking
about this...

12:54.041 --> 12:56.443
unpleasantness with Mandy.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.147
And I think it's important
to remember

13:00.180 --> 13:01.982
you had good intentions.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.151
Aw, thanks, Jen. I'll, uh...

13:04.184 --> 13:06.186
I'll try to hold on to that.
Thanks.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.521
What I mean is they say

13:08.555 --> 13:11.158
the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.829
And they are right.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.267
I love that we are getting
comfortable enough

13:20.300 --> 13:23.236
with each other
that I can tell you to get out.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.377
-Hey, honey.
-Hi, hi.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.145
Mm. How are you doing?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.014
-Not great.
-Oh?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.883
-No. Mm.
-What's up?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.051
Mandy and I had a disagreement.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I-I did hear about that.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.123
She texted me all about it,

13:43.156 --> 13:46.326
but autocorrect
wouldn't let her swear.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.329
Well, she's overreacting.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.999
I mean, I was being a good mom
by trying to make sure

13:52.032 --> 13:53.901
any place they found was safe.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.237
Jen was just complimenting
my intentions.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.240
Well, we certainly
wouldn't want them moving

14:00.273 --> 14:03.343
into a horrible place
next to a liquor store

14:03.376 --> 14:06.313
with no heat
and bikers living upstairs.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.749
That was our first place.
(chuckles)

14:09.782 --> 14:11.885
The one on Leetsdale.
Yeah.

14:11.919 --> 14:15.322
An apartment so bad
they gave us a security deposit.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.992
Listen, uh, we liked that place,
at least for one reason, right?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.593
We kept saying to each other,

14:20.627 --> 14:23.897
"We've got to get out
of this place." Right?

14:23.931 --> 14:26.566
Listen, and then we did, we got
out of that place, we moved on.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.902
I don't want Mandy living
in a place like that.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.670
I'm not as comfortable
as you are

14:30.703 --> 14:32.172
with letting our kids
take risks.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.941
I'm not comfortable
with them taking risks,

14:33.974 --> 14:36.443
but that's why we had three.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.014
This is not helping.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.682
Okay.
How about this?

14:42.715 --> 14:46.019
Let's say we can find
the safest place in Denver,

14:46.053 --> 14:49.389
I mean 100% safe, even if we had
to kick in some rent.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.224
Well, uh, no, how are we
gonna find that? Uh...

14:51.258 --> 14:53.593
Even if we could do that...

14:53.626 --> 14:55.795
do you think that's the answer
to this problem?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.475
(stoner voice):
Hey, dude.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.278
Downstairs they said
the real dope is upstairs.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.015
I think the real dope
just walked in the door. Hey-o!

15:16.283 --> 15:18.485
(normal voice): Listen,
I got a little bad news for you.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.988
Well, I'm already a capitalist
and a Republican.

15:21.021 --> 15:24.091
What, did you found out
that I'm related to Ted Cruz?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.459
He is Canadian.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.097
No, I got a notice from the
city, and your clearances

15:30.130 --> 15:31.498
were rejected.
Sorry.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.100
Yeah.
Well, doesn't matter anyway,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.135
because I'd have to do
so many upgrades to comply

15:35.168 --> 15:37.804
with city code that I would
never get any of my money back,

15:37.837 --> 15:39.672
and seeing as how money
is the only thing

15:39.706 --> 15:42.142
that matters to me now,
it's a no-go.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.177
Oh, you're really getting worked
up about this, aren't you?

15:44.211 --> 15:46.479
'Cause I don't know
who I am anymore, Mike.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.282
-Right there. Calm down.
-I, uh,

15:49.316 --> 15:50.750
I used to care
about people, okay?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.520
And now all I care about
is moolah, scratch,

15:53.553 --> 15:56.089
dinero, the cheddar.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.192
You must like it, 'cause you got
a lot of pet names for it.

16:00.327 --> 16:04.164
Okay, uh, listen, there might be
another way to go.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.933
You could go ahead
and do the expansion

16:06.966 --> 16:08.935
and just, uh,
take your chances, huh?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.970
No, I can't.
That's illegal.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.506
Only if you get caught.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.208
And what's the worst
that could happen?

16:15.242 --> 16:17.177
They would pull my permit
and all my employees

16:17.210 --> 16:19.479
would be out of work,
and I'm not gonna do that.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.815
Because you care
about employees.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.851
Yes. You're right.
I care.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.953
They're my employees, and I am
gonna take care of them.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.056
So you're not
the Monopoly man, okay?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.291
Not all businessmen are.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.892
You know, it's possible
to make money

16:32.925 --> 16:34.994
and still have a conscience.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.197
Yeah, but for so long
I thought the two

16:37.230 --> 16:39.066
were mutually exclusive.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.402
That's because for so long
you just had one of those.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.206
Caring only about profits
is the easy way,

16:46.239 --> 16:49.076
but you've never done
anything the easy way.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.312
I think that's a compliment.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.381
Listen, there might be a way

16:54.414 --> 16:58.218
to make money on this space
and still help people.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.819
Okay. How?

16:59.852 --> 17:03.556
Well, this whole block here
is zoned live-work,

17:03.590 --> 17:06.159
and this used to be
an apartment.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.595
Do you think someone
wants to live up here?

17:08.628 --> 17:09.896
I think I might know
a young couple

17:09.929 --> 17:12.499
that's looking
for a little fixer-upper.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.767
Yeah, well, it would be nice
to do somebody some good.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.169
-Yeah.
-And I could charge

17:16.203 --> 17:17.870
a little bit less
than fair market value,

17:17.904 --> 17:19.572
and I don't even care
if the rent's a little late

17:19.606 --> 17:22.342
because, like,
I'm a cool landlord.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.678
(chuckles)
You're a cool landlord.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.747
And a capitalist.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.882
Maybe.
But, you know,

17:29.916 --> 17:32.419
you're showing an awful lot
of concern for the little guy,

17:32.452 --> 17:34.354
the needy, the disadvantaged.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.955
You know what that makes you?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.925
Late for my shareholder meeting.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.793
Mascot's a donkey.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.263
Looks like a jackass to me.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.932
With a little work,

17:45.965 --> 17:47.567
there's plenty of room
for all your equipment.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.768
I mean, the rent's right,
and I'm...

17:48.801 --> 17:50.036
I think that
your landlord probably

17:50.069 --> 17:52.172
self-imposed rent control.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.142
So, what do you think?

17:55.175 --> 17:56.576
I don't know, Dad.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.745
We were looking
for someplace that's safer.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.715
You, uh, have anything
in a plastic bubble?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.152
Mandy, I think
you should take it.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.986
-You mean it?
-I do, I do,

18:07.019 --> 18:09.156
and I'm happy for both of you.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.259
Excuse me.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.094
She didn't seem very happy.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.729
I better talk to her.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.166
No, babe...

18:19.199 --> 18:21.268
I'll handle it.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.908
A plastic bubble might be fun.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.211
Hamsters always seem happy.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.814
Mom?

18:34.847 --> 18:37.817
I... No, I was checking e-mail.
I swear I wasn't calling anyone.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.854
Look, I just wanted to make sure
you're okay with this.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.691
Mandy, come here.
Sit down, sit down.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.694
Honey,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.996
I owe you an apology.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.865
I-I shouldn't have interfered
the way I did

18:52.899 --> 18:54.434
in your apartment hunt.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.337
No, you shouldn't have.
I'm not a kid anymore.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.939
No, you're an adult, and, um...

18:59.972 --> 19:03.210
and that's really been
my problem.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.144
What do you mean?

19:05.178 --> 19:07.880
I-I always knew that one day
you would move out.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.450
I-I was prepared for that,
as your mother,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
but then this past year

19:12.519 --> 19:14.654
-we spent all this
time together.
-Mm-hmm.

19:14.687 --> 19:18.691
And you are this terrific,
terrific person,

19:18.725 --> 19:22.161
and... I have loved
hanging out with you.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.730
(chuckles)

19:23.763 --> 19:26.132
I-I feel like we've become
more than mother and daughter.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.367
We've become, uh...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.202
-We've become friends.
-Friends.

19:29.236 --> 19:33.273
Yeah. Yeah, really,
really good friends.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.878
It's just...

19:38.911 --> 19:40.880
it's hard for me to..

19:40.913 --> 19:43.616
watch you go.
It's...

19:44.884 --> 19:47.220
I love hanging out
with you, too.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.222
Okay? And I'm not gonna
let that go

19:49.256 --> 19:51.090
just because I live
somewhere else.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.759
-Mm, well, I hope not.
-No.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.827
Besides, you're gonna be
at my place all the time.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.195
Yeah.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.664
You're gonna be putting in
shelf paper

19:57.697 --> 19:59.732
and organizing the spices and...

19:59.766 --> 20:02.369
everything else
that I need my mommy for.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.404
Oh, you better believe
I'll be there.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.839
I mean, um, is-is that
gonna be okay?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.841
Yeah, more than okay.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.910
Better than okay?

20:10.943 --> 20:13.546
We cool.

20:13.580 --> 20:18.518
Um, is it okay if I ask Ryan
if he's checked for radon?

20:18.551 --> 20:19.552
Mom.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.020
Yeah, right, right, right, no.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.723
That's, um...
that's why we had three.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.260
What?

20:27.294 --> 20:30.497
Uh... just something
your dad said.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.771
VANESSA:
Okay, now,

20:38.805 --> 20:40.807
as soon as
the chicken breasts are brown,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.943
-then you flip them.
-Yeah, I can't do that.

20:43.976 --> 20:47.079
-(gasps) I think it moved.
-Oh, no, no, no. It didn't move.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.749
It didn't move. You can do it,
you can do it. Listen. Honey.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.551
Forget about
the pork chop fiasco.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.286
-Okay.
-Okay, just-just-just do it.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.887
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm flipping the chicken.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.723
-Okay. All right, okay.
-(yelps)

20:56.756 --> 20:58.391
-I did it! (squealing)
-You did it! Yay!

20:58.425 --> 21:00.660
All right, all right, all right,
now pour on the sauce.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.562
-No, I'm afraid to.
-Yeah. No, look, look, look,

21:02.595 --> 21:04.230
it's not gonna
burst into flames.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.232
That's the mistake we made
with the tequila chicken.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.968
-Just pour it on, pour it on.
-Okay, okay.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.670
-Mm-hmm.
-Good. There you go.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.271
(both chuckle)

21:12.305 --> 21:14.173
All right, all right.
Here. Okay.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.009
Cover the pan, and, uh, voilà.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.346
-15 minutes, you have dinner.
-Okay. Okay.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.681
(exhales) Well, how do we know
when 15 minutes is up?

21:21.714 --> 21:22.915
Do we have a timer?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.585
Well, in a way, uh,
15 minutes is, hmm,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.821
give or take,
half a glass of wine.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.123
Well, wouldn't that depend
on the size of the glass

21:31.157 --> 21:33.426
-and how big the minutes are?
-Honey...

21:33.460 --> 21:35.395
drink the wine.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.632
(chicken clucks)

21:39.666 --> 21:41.634
