WEBVTT

00:44.599 --> 00:46.269
- Dad! Come on!
- Yeah?

00:46.302 --> 00:48.173
- Lasso me!

00:48.206 --> 00:49.309
- Dad!

00:49.342 --> 00:51.313
- I-I gotta mow the lawn,
sugar.

00:51.346 --> 00:53.116
You said that
an hour ago.

00:55.688 --> 00:58.326
Oh, the sad face, huh?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.498
Yeah, every time.

01:00.598 --> 01:01.733
Works every time.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.403
You're a smart girl,
I'll give you that.

01:03.436 --> 01:04.773
Ah, let's see.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.731
All right.
Oh, she's wild.

01:16.764 --> 01:18.433
All right, totem pole, Annie.

01:19.536 --> 01:21.272
Yo-ho-ho-ho!
Got her.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.310
I got her.
I got me a calf.

01:23.343 --> 01:24.713
I got me a little calf.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.392
- Totem pole, totem pole!

01:40.578 --> 01:42.548
You guys
wanna braid grass?

01:42.648 --> 01:44.352
My friend knows how.

01:50.230 --> 01:51.767
- Jeb?

01:51.867 --> 01:54.372
- Huh?
Phone.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.308
- I gotta go in.
It's the station.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.712
- Mm...blech!
- Pfft!

01:57.812 --> 01:58.914
Okay.

02:00.618 --> 02:01.820
Take care of my hat.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.893
- It sounded urgent.
All right.

02:06.630 --> 02:07.699
What about the fireworks?

02:07.799 --> 02:10.136
They do fireworks
every year on Pioneer Day,

02:10.236 --> 02:11.774
so we'll just see 'em
next year.

02:11.807 --> 02:13.911
Slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

02:13.944 --> 02:16.783
Annie.
Annie, he's on the phone.

02:16.883 --> 02:17.852
Why do you have
to go to work?

02:17.885 --> 02:19.589
Annie, I said--
- Listen to your mom.

02:19.689 --> 02:20.491
I said out
of your costume and into--

02:20.525 --> 02:22.327
- Give me the address there?
Sorry.

02:22.427 --> 02:23.864
Yeah, I'll be right there.

02:31.613 --> 02:33.250
Where's Mom?

02:33.283 --> 02:35.353
- Asleep still.
Do you want me to...

02:35.453 --> 02:36.857
Uh...
- Wake her up?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.794
- I'll grab her.
- Okay.

02:44.438 --> 02:45.407
- Mom.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.210
Mom?

02:47.310 --> 02:48.346
Hey.

02:49.415 --> 02:50.751
We--we have to do evening
prayer fast tonight, Mom.

02:50.851 --> 02:52.622
I've been called in to work.

02:52.722 --> 02:54.559
Oh.
- It's all right.

02:54.659 --> 02:55.728
Yes.

02:57.599 --> 02:58.734
Remember the church?

02:58.834 --> 02:59.536
Okay, let's open the doors.
Hey, Annie?

02:59.636 --> 03:00.704
There are all the people.

03:00.804 --> 03:02.709
It's time.

03:05.548 --> 03:07.652
Okay.
Let's see here.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.689
Can I do it tonight?

03:10.457 --> 03:11.560
Yeah.

03:11.593 --> 03:13.731
But we don't need
a wish list, Caroline.

03:13.831 --> 03:16.704
That's not what--
- Dear heavenly Father,

03:16.737 --> 03:19.843
please bless the missionaries
serving around the world

03:19.876 --> 03:22.582
and our prophet,
President Kimball.

03:22.615 --> 03:24.686
And keep Grandpa in heaven

03:24.719 --> 03:26.222
from being lonely
until we get there.

03:26.322 --> 03:28.460
Your grandfather's
not in heaven, dear.

03:28.494 --> 03:30.631
He's in the bathroom.

03:32.569 --> 03:37.244
And thank you
for helping Dad fix my bike.

03:37.344 --> 03:38.547
And for our birthdays,

03:38.647 --> 03:40.618
may I please have
an Easy-Bake Oven

03:40.651 --> 03:42.254
and the skates
I wanted for Christmas

03:42.354 --> 03:45.628
but didn't get?
- Caroline. Caroline, enough.

03:45.728 --> 03:47.732
Close your eyes.

03:50.303 --> 03:51.338
Heavenly Father,

03:54.646 --> 03:57.886
and to help fix
what we find broken.

03:57.919 --> 04:01.693
And please take care
of my family while I'm away.

04:01.793 --> 04:05.501
They are my love
and my life for all eternity.

04:05.601 --> 04:08.006
In the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.676
Amen.

04:09.776 --> 04:11.012
Good job, honey.

04:11.045 --> 04:13.049
Okay, come on.
Are we doing bedtime stories?

04:13.082 --> 04:13.984
Yeah.

04:15.387 --> 04:16.590
Yeah.

04:19.428 --> 04:20.865
- It's all right.

04:22.569 --> 04:24.706
Promise.

05:08.961 --> 05:10.330
A stretch,

05:10.430 --> 05:12.401
and a fastball
misses high and away.

05:12.434 --> 05:14.840
Ball four.

07:28.841 --> 07:30.744
E-evil.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.240
No.

07:46.576 --> 07:47.712
No.

08:07.284 --> 08:08.754
All right,
we need to stand up.

08:08.787 --> 08:09.822
Come on.

08:11.660 --> 08:15.701
And I need you to get Morris
to bring the print kit

08:15.734 --> 08:17.538
and, um, a video camera.

08:17.638 --> 08:20.845
I need you both to record every
single corner in that house.

08:20.878 --> 08:22.281
- I don't think
I can go back in.

08:22.314 --> 08:24.786
- Gather yourself.

08:24.886 --> 08:27.190
For their sake.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.660
Come on.

08:31.298 --> 08:32.902
Stay right there.
Stay right there!

08:33.002 --> 08:34.639
Hands up!

08:34.739 --> 08:35.774
Hands in the air!

08:42.788 --> 08:43.790
Don't move!

08:43.890 --> 08:46.997
Stay right there, right now!

09:28.112 --> 09:29.882
So he's covered in blood

09:29.982 --> 09:31.719
and was hiding
in a neighbor's house.

09:31.819 --> 09:33.089
His own phone line
was cut, so he said

09:33.122 --> 09:35.092
he was using his neighbor's
line to call 911.

09:35.192 --> 09:37.263
Just find me next of kin
of the deceased, please.

09:37.363 --> 09:38.934
- He's yours now.
- Thank you.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.237
Hey, you going
back to the house?

09:40.270 --> 09:41.973
- Yeah, right away.
- Great.

09:43.109 --> 09:44.378
Did we, uh,
interrupt your date

09:44.411 --> 09:47.183
with Sister Moonshine,
Detective?

09:47.283 --> 09:49.856
- The kid's a Lafferty, as in--

09:49.889 --> 09:51.191
- Denney.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.036
Evening.

09:57.136 --> 09:59.976
- Evening, sir.

10:00.009 --> 10:02.648
Female's 24.
The child is 15 months.

10:04.117 --> 10:07.123
Suspect's the husband
from a big LDS family,

10:07.223 --> 10:10.096
as in...highly regarded.

10:12.433 --> 10:15.106
Identify a motive,
turn it into a confession,

10:15.139 --> 10:16.275
we wrap it up.

10:16.308 --> 10:17.979
- How about I take the lead
with him,

10:18.012 --> 10:19.347
Mormon to Mormon?

10:19.447 --> 10:21.185
- He's all yours.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.924
- Need a minute?

10:24.024 --> 10:26.161
- Right behind ya.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.087
- Allen, it's Officer Pyre.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.060
Gonna take the cuffs off,

10:42.160 --> 10:43.429
if that's all right with you.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.011
Thank you.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.057
That one too.

11:00.530 --> 11:01.766
All right.

11:04.772 --> 11:08.012
This is my partner,
uh, Detective Taba.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.788
You know, we just gotta ask you

11:12.888 --> 11:14.457
just a couple more questions,
if that's all right.

11:16.061 --> 11:17.698
Okay, great.

11:17.798 --> 11:21.471
When's the last time you saw
your wife and daughter alive?

11:22.207 --> 11:24.211
- I-I-I-I didn't do this.

11:24.244 --> 11:25.781
You shared that.

11:25.814 --> 11:30.958
Now, c-can you tell me
when you saw them last?

11:31.058 --> 11:31.993
- Um...

11:32.093 --> 11:36.770
yeah, uh...this morning

11:36.803 --> 11:38.472
before the sun came up.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.946
- Okay, great.
Before I left for work.

11:42.046 --> 11:43.784
- And what kind
of work do you do?

11:43.817 --> 11:46.421
- Uh, I work in, um,
construction...

11:46.522 --> 11:48.226
uh, tiling.

11:48.259 --> 11:49.227
Can I give your boss
a ring

11:49.327 --> 11:50.897
just to get the time
confirmed?

11:50.997 --> 11:53.168
- I-I work for myself.

11:53.268 --> 11:55.139
- Ah. Okay, I see.

11:55.239 --> 11:57.110
- You know what, son?

11:57.143 --> 11:59.849
You could just make this
real simple.

12:00.584 --> 12:03.355
It's all right, Allen.
You know, people work alone.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.496
People work alone.
- Sure.

12:06.529 --> 12:08.165
Right. Um...

12:08.265 --> 12:10.102
so where was the--
this job of yours?

12:11.105 --> 12:15.112
- Um, up I-15 to--to Sandy.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.448
Great.
You got an address?

12:18.419 --> 12:20.357
- I-I don't know.
Um...

12:20.390 --> 12:23.128
I can't--I can't--

12:23.228 --> 12:25.100
I can't--I can't think straight
right now.

12:27.571 --> 12:30.476
Can I change my clothes,
please?

12:35.621 --> 12:37.223
Please?

12:37.323 --> 12:40.229
- No.
Sorry, not--not quite yet.

12:43.469 --> 12:46.074
- Please--please find
the rest of my family.

12:46.174 --> 12:50.016
M-my brothers
and their wives and kids.

12:50.116 --> 12:52.154
- Why would I have
to find them all?

12:52.187 --> 12:55.827
- I-if there's someone
out hunting my family

12:55.927 --> 12:59.300
then, you know,

12:59.400 --> 13:02.174
they could--they could
be in trouble too.

13:02.207 --> 13:03.443
Give us addresses.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.312
We'll do safety checks
right now.

13:05.412 --> 13:06.916
I don't know
their addresses.

13:07.016 --> 13:08.587
You don't know
where your own brothers live?

13:08.620 --> 13:10.924
No, they moved.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.528
Sam moved.

13:12.561 --> 13:14.230
Uh, Robin moved.

13:14.330 --> 13:17.437
I'm--I'm not--I'm not lying
to you, sir, please.

13:17.538 --> 13:20.109
- And who'd want
to hunt them down?

13:20.209 --> 13:21.411
Well, um...

13:23.482 --> 13:26.488
For the past year or--
or more, um...

13:28.092 --> 13:31.999
Men--peculiar men--

13:32.099 --> 13:34.606
were taken with my family.

13:34.639 --> 13:39.047
They--they had, uh,
beards, long beards.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.620
Like vagrants?
- You know how often

13:41.653 --> 13:43.857
the old "vagrants killed
my wife" story pans out, Allen?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.162
- Not--not vagrants.

13:46.195 --> 13:49.903
Like...Bible or--or...

13:49.936 --> 13:51.573
Book of Mormon prophets.

13:51.606 --> 13:55.547
Please help me find
the rest of my family.

14:06.168 --> 14:07.505
Detective?

14:07.538 --> 14:09.107
The only number
he knew by heart

14:09.207 --> 14:10.343
was for his eldest brother,
Ron,

14:10.376 --> 14:11.546
but no one's picking up.

14:11.646 --> 14:14.050
- Well, it is well past
Mormon bedtime.

14:14.150 --> 14:16.989
- No, no, we'd pick up,
especially after00 p.m.

14:23.269 --> 14:24.905
Oh, sorry.

14:26.308 --> 14:28.614
Ron isn't the kind
to let his phone just ring,

14:28.647 --> 14:30.116
so let's--let's get officers
to his house

14:30.216 --> 14:31.185
once you get an address,

14:31.218 --> 14:33.155
and the same goes
for the rest of his family.

14:33.255 --> 14:34.525
- Got it, sir.
Thank you.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.362
We are not falling for

14:36.395 --> 14:37.664
the "bearded strangers" story,
are we?

14:37.764 --> 14:39.268
I don't doubt
you saw plenty of beards

14:39.301 --> 14:40.537
when you were in Vegas,

14:40.637 --> 14:43.041
but here the church
vigorously discourages them,

14:43.141 --> 14:44.210
so it could be meaningful.

14:44.244 --> 14:46.382
Were--were these outsiders,
and if so, from where?

14:46.415 --> 14:49.254
- What it means is that
he's trying to distract us

14:49.287 --> 14:50.991
with his clean shave.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.193
When a wife shows up dead,

14:52.293 --> 14:53.663
who's always
suspect number one?

14:53.763 --> 14:55.433
The husband.
And why?

14:55.534 --> 14:57.938
Because it's always him.
We both goddamn know that.

14:58.038 --> 14:59.207
- Language, please.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.679
- Right.

15:01.779 --> 15:04.284
Look, everything I see here
points to guilt.

15:04.317 --> 15:07.290
And no offense to your
secret LDS handshakes,

15:07.390 --> 15:09.394
but it looks to me
that he prefers my company

15:09.427 --> 15:11.298
to Mormon to Mormon.

15:12.033 --> 15:14.103
Give me ten minutes
alone with him.

15:14.203 --> 15:16.308
I'll get a confession.

15:18.647 --> 15:21.318
I was in their family's
ward for a time.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.458
None of this makes sense.

15:24.492 --> 15:26.361
No, I'll make it
quick and painless.

15:27.698 --> 15:29.033
- Fine.

15:30.203 --> 15:31.438
Right.

15:34.044 --> 15:36.014
Did you see
your brother Ron today?

15:37.116 --> 15:38.252
- No.

15:38.352 --> 15:41.191
No, I...haven't seen Ron for--

15:41.291 --> 15:42.628
for a-about a year.

15:42.728 --> 15:43.564
Why?

15:43.597 --> 15:45.266
He's not answering his phone,

15:45.366 --> 15:47.136
but I can send some officers
to his home

15:47.236 --> 15:48.740
if you remember his address.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.611
I think he moved, too,

15:50.644 --> 15:52.480
since I saw him last.

15:52.514 --> 15:54.484
Mm. Listen.

15:55.787 --> 15:59.528
I was married
to a beautiful woman once too.

16:01.131 --> 16:04.470
She broke my heart wide open.
She cheated on me.

16:06.475 --> 16:09.480
Some nights, I just wanted
to wring her neck

16:09.581 --> 16:11.619
for all the pain she caused.

16:13.422 --> 16:14.692
Was your wife seeing someone?

16:16.796 --> 16:18.432
Or was it you...

16:21.104 --> 16:22.741
That had someone on the side?

16:24.177 --> 16:26.248
Listen, my partner's not here.

16:26.348 --> 16:27.651
Your bishop's not here.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.526
It's just us guys.

16:39.074 --> 16:40.644
Are you LDS, sir?

16:41.646 --> 16:44.351
No, never was.

16:44.384 --> 16:45.787
Is that a problem?

16:46.723 --> 16:52.066
- If you wanna find
who's responsible for this,

16:52.166 --> 16:54.104
look to them...

16:54.137 --> 16:56.542
the Mormons, their saints.

16:58.412 --> 17:00.149
- Aren't you and your wife
LDS?

17:00.249 --> 17:01.686
- We were.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.527
She was still...

17:05.627 --> 17:07.029
Seven days a week.

17:11.539 --> 17:14.344
Thou shalt love thy wife
with all thy heart

17:14.444 --> 17:16.214
and shall cleave
unto her and none else.

17:16.314 --> 17:17.818
Doctrine and Covenants22.

17:17.851 --> 17:19.789
Allen, did you love your wife
with all your heart?

17:19.822 --> 17:21.292
- What are you doing?
Shh, shh.

17:21.325 --> 17:22.528
Yes.
- Did you kneel together

17:22.561 --> 17:25.634
in the temple
and make covenants together?

17:26.669 --> 17:28.840
Do you still have
a temple recommend?

17:28.940 --> 17:30.678
Simple questions, Allen.
These are simple questions.

17:30.711 --> 17:31.846
It's not admissible.

17:31.879 --> 17:33.850
- I don't care
that it's not admissible.

17:33.883 --> 17:35.185
Thank you.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.325
Hands on the table.

17:43.936 --> 17:46.074
If you've turned your back
on heavenly Father,

17:46.174 --> 17:50.082
I'm confident that forensics
will have proved your guilt

17:50.182 --> 17:51.719
by tomorrow morning.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.858
- I met with her in the temple.

17:56.662 --> 17:59.400
I brought her to church
with my family.

17:59.501 --> 18:03.342
You look at these as signs
of innocence, but they aren't.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.611
- Did you break
your covenant...

18:04.711 --> 18:06.181
so she threatened to leave you?

18:06.214 --> 18:07.483
Is that what happened?

18:07.584 --> 18:09.420
I can imagine the fights.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.124
That why you killed her?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.594
- No.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.632
Or did she turn away
from the Gospel too?

18:14.732 --> 18:16.602
- No, it's the opposite.

18:17.571 --> 18:19.875
Her testimony was unbreakable.

18:21.178 --> 18:22.748
The perfect Mormon girl.

18:29.528 --> 18:30.898
- She was perfect.

19:27.309 --> 19:28.947
It--it's a good thing
I didn't win.

19:30.717 --> 19:34.190
As runner-up, I still get $450.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.896
That's only $50 less
than the winner.

19:36.996 --> 19:38.633
And I don't have
to stay in Twin Falls

19:38.733 --> 19:40.469
for grocery store openings
like she does.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.839
- I'm a free woman.

19:41.939 --> 19:43.442
- Well, good--
good for you, honey.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.645
That's good.

19:44.745 --> 19:45.981
And if I'm going
to give myself

19:46.014 --> 19:48.687
the best chance
of getting on TV, I mean...

19:48.720 --> 19:49.855
I need to be in a big city.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.257
Well, you know, Princess,

19:51.357 --> 19:53.228
New York and Chicago
aren't half as nice

19:53.328 --> 19:54.397
as in the movies say.

19:54.430 --> 19:56.434
Just be patient, okay?

19:56.535 --> 19:58.940
The Lord has a divine plan
for all His daughters, right?

19:58.973 --> 20:00.309
Well, of course His plan

20:00.409 --> 20:04.217
isn't for me to move
to Chicago or New York

20:04.317 --> 20:07.958
with all the rats and,
like, Democrats and crazies.

20:07.991 --> 20:09.595
I'll go to a big city

20:09.695 --> 20:10.897
with values.
- That's good.

20:10.997 --> 20:12.768
- Salt Lake City.
Well, we're not gonna

20:12.868 --> 20:14.905
want you to go anywhere
until you finish school.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.742
- I think our Savior
would much prefer me

20:16.842 --> 20:18.780
to finish school at BYU.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.351
I mean, their broadcast
journalism department

20:21.451 --> 20:22.721
is respected all over.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.490
- Why don't we think on it,
hmm?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.994
Pray on it?

20:26.094 --> 20:27.865
Make sure this isn't
a real big reaction

20:27.898 --> 20:29.434
to a tough little day, huh?

20:29.467 --> 20:32.340
- Every time I have an idea,
it's too much or too far.

20:32.373 --> 20:33.309
- Yeah, that's right.

20:34.612 --> 20:36.247
- I'm going to Salt Lake City.

20:36.347 --> 20:39.688
I'm going
to Brigham Young University.

20:39.788 --> 20:41.325
And I'm going to be
on television.

20:41.358 --> 20:43.696
- Hey, kids, who wants
Brenda's room if she leaves?

20:43.796 --> 20:44.999
- Me! Me!
Oh, I do! I do!

20:47.036 --> 20:48.507
Who gets the big room?

20:48.540 --> 20:49.908
- No, I do!
- Me!

20:50.008 --> 20:50.977
- Thanks, Dad.

21:01.397 --> 21:05.373
She came here to Utah

21:05.406 --> 21:07.276
to help build up Zion.

21:13.088 --> 21:15.793
Now I think
I'm responsible for this.

21:16.662 --> 21:18.900
- Responsible for what?

21:20.369 --> 21:21.872
- Reeling her in.

21:23.475 --> 21:24.778
Keeping her in it.

21:27.551 --> 21:30.823
I bet you think your testimony
is bulletproof,

21:30.923 --> 21:34.397
that you know our history,

21:34.498 --> 21:36.669
the Gospel,

21:36.702 --> 21:39.842
all our...truth.

21:41.411 --> 21:42.681
Let me tell you this.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.693
If you feel certain,

21:48.726 --> 21:50.563
that certain...

21:53.836 --> 21:55.105
You don't know a thing, sir.

21:56.842 --> 22:00.617
My only regret

22:00.717 --> 22:05.527
is that I didn't
drive her out of Zion

22:05.560 --> 22:09.433
to save her from our people.

22:11.505 --> 22:15.681
To get her as far away
from all of this as I could.

22:24.665 --> 22:27.136
- Po

22:27.236 --> 22:29.775
Could be one person.
Could be more.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.377
Salt Lake's labs
should know by morning.

22:31.477 --> 22:33.048
I just wanna know
who opened that nursery door,

22:33.148 --> 22:34.986
did what they did
to that baby girl.

22:35.019 --> 22:37.625
If it's Allen, we charge him,
get him to Draper

22:37.658 --> 22:39.829
and in front of a firing squad.

22:39.862 --> 22:42.032
- I've only found two numbers
for his five brothers.

22:42.132 --> 22:44.538
One's out of service,
and the other just rings.

22:44.638 --> 22:46.976
Ron's last known address
is empty.

22:47.009 --> 22:49.615
The realtor says it's been
up for sale nearly a year.

22:50.583 --> 22:53.623
- The victim's father's here.
I'll go ahead and notify him.

22:53.723 --> 22:54.759
- No, we're not doing that yet.

22:54.859 --> 22:56.896
- That's what we do.
It's not what we do here.

22:56.929 --> 22:58.733
First we locate the rest
of Allen's family

22:58.766 --> 23:00.504
so I got every question
at the ready.

23:00.537 --> 23:02.106
Small town. Let's go.

23:04.511 --> 23:06.114
Shut the door, please.

23:09.053 --> 23:11.424
She--she had a nightmare.

23:11.525 --> 23:13.462
Took me an hour
to get her to stop screaming.

23:13.496 --> 23:14.631
Shoot.

23:14.731 --> 23:15.934
I'm sorry, honey.

23:16.034 --> 23:18.038
- I-I think it might be time.
No, no.

23:18.138 --> 23:20.042
I don't wanna put her
on medications.

23:20.075 --> 23:21.912
You know
what they'll do to her.

23:23.616 --> 23:24.851
- Okay. Yeah.

23:24.951 --> 23:25.987
I know this is hard,

23:26.923 --> 23:28.091
but I think
this is a-a test for us.

23:28.191 --> 23:30.029
- Hey,
the girls' party tomorrow,

23:30.062 --> 23:31.899
um, do you think you--
Yeah, of course.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.468
You know I'm gonna be there.

23:33.569 --> 23:35.439
You can't flip an upside-down
cake to save your life.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.508
heavenly Father knows.

23:38.178 --> 23:39.047
and it's gonna end up
on your feet.
- Thank you.

23:39.147 --> 23:40.616
It's gonna end up
on your shoes.

23:40.716 --> 23:41.719
So I'm gonna be there.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.691
Honey, I need your help.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.931
Um, remember the Laffertys?

23:47.964 --> 23:49.167
Dad was a chiropractor

23:49.200 --> 23:51.872
and his son was Ron,
Lafferty Construction?

23:51.972 --> 23:53.943
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Ron and Dianna?

23:53.976 --> 23:55.880
- Yeah, right. So, um...

23:57.517 --> 23:59.855
Um, so we--we have
two deceased.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.459
- Oh, my gosh.
Are you at the ER?

24:02.560 --> 24:05.767
No. It wasn't
an accident, sweetie.

24:05.867 --> 24:07.203
- Oh. Um...

24:07.236 --> 24:08.238
Just wondering, do we have

24:08.338 --> 24:12.080
any of the addresses, uh,
for any of the Laffertys,

24:12.113 --> 24:14.250
maybe from an old church
directory or something?

24:14.283 --> 24:15.753
- Yeah.
I'll check--I'll check for you.

24:15.853 --> 24:17.991
- Thanks.
And, um, I love you.

24:18.091 --> 24:20.062
- Um, I love you.
Okay. Bye.

24:20.095 --> 24:21.064
- Okay.

24:34.958 --> 24:37.029
No forced entry.

24:37.129 --> 24:38.766
There's no items
of value taken.

24:38.866 --> 24:39.968
Except for the two lives.

24:41.939 --> 24:46.147
Just...invading
Old Testament prophets.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.925
If you're innocent,

24:52.025 --> 24:53.729
just give us something.

24:54.297 --> 24:56.869
Give us a name,
give us an affair,

24:56.902 --> 24:59.107
a grudge, anyone who had
their eyes on her--

24:59.140 --> 25:00.242
anything.

25:02.881 --> 25:04.083
- Everyone.

25:06.589 --> 25:07.991
They all wanted her to--

25:10.095 --> 25:13.035
They all wanted
to find fault in her

25:13.068 --> 25:15.907
or for her to save them...

25:16.909 --> 25:18.846
Sometimes both at once.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.192
- Whoo!

25:42.661 --> 25:44.632
I just gotta
get this thing away.

25:44.665 --> 25:46.201
My dad can't stand it.
No, no, no.

25:46.234 --> 25:47.771
Don't you dare leave me here.

25:47.804 --> 25:48.940
Uh, all right.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.612
Just, less is more when
it comes to talking, all right?

25:51.712 --> 25:52.747
- What do you mean?

25:52.847 --> 25:53.949
- Huh?
Hi!

25:54.049 --> 25:55.219
Hi there.

25:55.252 --> 25:57.791
Mom, uh, Dad, this is Brenda.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.929
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you finally.

25:59.962 --> 26:01.799
Took him long enough
to get up the nerve.

26:01.899 --> 26:03.035
Nerve?

26:03.068 --> 26:04.136
- He's never brought
a girl home before.

26:04.236 --> 26:05.573
Never.
- Really?

26:05.673 --> 26:07.076
- The one and only.
Mm-hmm.

26:07.109 --> 26:09.080
And this
is my one and only, Doreen.

26:09.113 --> 26:10.983
I'm Ammon.
- Hi.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.353
- I know. I know.
I've heard so much about you.

26:12.386 --> 26:15.258
- Oh! All the way up in Idaho?
- And from Allen.

26:15.358 --> 26:17.798
- Oh, gossip
is the devil's playground.

26:17.831 --> 26:19.133
Well, I heard you--

26:19.233 --> 26:20.903
you left college in Idaho
with no degree to speak of.

26:21.003 --> 26:23.241
- Oh, well, um, sir,

26:23.341 --> 26:25.680
President Kimball said,
"Stand ye in holy places"...

26:25.713 --> 26:26.982
Yes, he did.

26:28.986 --> 26:30.188
while they threw up
from all the booze

26:30.288 --> 26:32.059
in the Idaho school, so...

26:32.159 --> 26:33.663
Hmm.

26:33.696 --> 26:35.031
- BYU is a far better fit

26:35.131 --> 26:36.234
for those who wanna live
Gospel standards.

26:36.267 --> 26:37.904
It is, indeed.

26:38.004 --> 26:39.039
- How high can
your standards be

26:39.139 --> 26:39.975
if you're hanging around
with the runt?

26:41.277 --> 26:42.379
This is, uh,
my brother Sam. Brenda.

26:42.479 --> 26:44.183
Jacob, Robin, come say hello.

26:44.283 --> 26:46.922
This is Brenda.
- Uh, this is my wife, Sara.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.158
- Hi.
- Our kids--where are ya?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.129
Junior, Joseph, Jared, Jenny.

26:50.162 --> 26:51.932
- Great to meet you
Jacob, Jared,

26:52.032 --> 26:53.235
Joseph, Junior, and Jenny.

26:53.268 --> 26:55.806
- Wow.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.276
- Allen, I believe you now.

26:57.376 --> 26:59.681
He just kept going on
about how pretty you are,

26:59.781 --> 27:01.919
and I didn't believe him,
but now I do.

27:02.019 --> 27:03.422
- Hi.
Sorry, I'm Robin.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.858
This is my wife, Lynn...

27:04.891 --> 27:06.027
- Hi.
Hi!

27:06.127 --> 27:07.396
- And our brood--
or some of it, anyway.

27:07.429 --> 27:10.670
- Hi. Hi!
And you must be Jacob.

27:12.139 --> 27:13.174
- Yeah.

27:13.274 --> 27:16.147
- Oh, gosh.
Is that everybody?

27:16.247 --> 27:19.020
No, it's a regular
Lafferty factory around here.

27:19.053 --> 27:21.291
I can't even keep up.
Samuel.

27:21.324 --> 27:22.995
You have a barbecue to mind.

27:23.028 --> 27:24.798
Don't forget that.

27:24.898 --> 27:26.234
Hey, Samuel?

27:26.334 --> 27:27.704
I'll just be here
with the runt of the bunch

27:27.804 --> 27:29.674
till you're all done
cooking my dinner.

27:31.044 --> 27:32.446
Are all Idaho girls like you?

27:32.479 --> 27:34.316
Oh, no, sir.

27:34.416 --> 27:36.054
The rest are sweet,
soft-spoken,

27:36.087 --> 27:37.222
and properly pretty, sir.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.696
- Well, you are plenty pretty.

27:42.199 --> 27:43.368
Smell that?
Smells like dinner.

27:43.468 --> 27:44.237
Hope you're hungry.

27:44.337 --> 27:46.173
- Please, join us.
Oh, okay.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.712
- Welcome.
I got to, uh...

27:48.812 --> 27:50.448
Allen. Oh.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.462
Are you all just gonna
stare at me

27:57.563 --> 27:59.066
like I'm some kind
of space alien?

27:59.166 --> 28:00.101
Yes.

28:00.201 --> 28:03.374
- Yes?
Okay.

28:16.835 --> 28:19.808
- Wait, how could you tell
that she was attracted to Ron?

28:21.812 --> 28:25.319
- Everybody was always
attracted to Ron.

28:25.352 --> 28:27.791
Must have made you
jealous, though.

28:27.824 --> 28:29.060
No.

28:29.093 --> 28:30.462
I was used to it.

28:30.496 --> 28:34.804
She and I, we didn't
have secrets back then.

28:36.575 --> 28:38.980
But it wasn't just Ron

28:39.013 --> 28:41.450
who couldn't keep his eyes
off her.

28:42.921 --> 28:43.956
- Oh!

28:43.989 --> 28:45.392
- Who else?

28:45.425 --> 28:47.129
Well, there was my brother Dan.

28:47.229 --> 28:48.966
- It was making a home
in your hair.

28:49.066 --> 28:50.837
Oh, gosh. Sorry.

28:50.870 --> 28:53.041
- No, don't be sorry.
They're good luck.

28:53.141 --> 28:54.410
Thank you for bringing her
to us, Brenda.

28:54.511 --> 28:56.515
- I brought you, um, lemonade.
- Oh!

28:56.615 --> 28:58.418
- Unless you don't like
fancy lemonade.

28:58.519 --> 28:59.453
I didn't even ask you.
- No, no, no, I do.

28:59.554 --> 29:01.091
This is my wife, Matilda.

29:01.124 --> 29:03.228
These are our girls.
- I'm Matilda. He's Dan.

29:03.261 --> 29:05.131
These are our girls,
my girls, our--

29:05.231 --> 29:06.434
well, our girls.
- Our--our girls.

29:08.972 --> 29:10.543
- But it was--you know,
it was playful, innocuous.

29:10.576 --> 29:13.414
He was just teasing me,
I suppose, and, um...

29:13.515 --> 29:15.485
- Can I ask you a question?
Oh, gosh.

29:15.586 --> 29:16.789
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

29:16.822 --> 29:21.932
- Um, do you all abide by the--
the Word of Wisdom at BYU?

29:22.534 --> 29:25.405
The reason I ask is 'cause
I've met a few BYU girls,

29:25.506 --> 29:27.978
and I'm not so sure
that they were obedient

29:28.011 --> 29:30.416
to heavenly Father when
the professors weren't looking.

29:30.449 --> 29:33.021
- Oh, well, we don't smoke
or drink coffee

29:33.054 --> 29:34.156
or anything horrible like that.

29:34.256 --> 29:36.293
I'm sure that's all you mean.
- Oh, don't be so sure.

29:36.393 --> 29:38.231
He's a right queerhawk.

29:38.331 --> 29:40.570
You pervert!
- I mean Pepsi-Cola.

29:40.603 --> 29:42.339
I mean, the caffeine,
the sugar,

29:42.439 --> 29:44.376
that'll kill a cute little
BYU thing very quickly.

29:44.476 --> 29:47.315
What's important
is--is--is natural energy.

29:47.415 --> 29:49.353
Fresh lawn clippings--

29:49.453 --> 29:51.892
if--if you extract
this down to a juice, okay,

29:51.925 --> 29:55.098
it is like drinking
heavenly Father's love.

29:56.134 --> 29:58.004
- I-I can't tell
if you're kidding.

29:58.037 --> 29:59.106
- Me neither.

29:59.206 --> 30:00.810
But I drink it anyway,
don't I?

30:00.910 --> 30:02.212
It turns my pee green.

30:07.489 --> 30:10.061
Oh. Hello.

30:10.161 --> 30:11.430
- Sister Lafferty.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.303
They've come for me.

30:15.238 --> 30:18.613
Please, w-will you help me?

30:18.646 --> 30:21.250
- Well, you know
I don't actually live here.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.054
I need your family's help.

30:26.060 --> 30:28.298
- Gosh, well, um...

30:28.331 --> 30:30.268
okay, just come in.

30:41.323 --> 30:42.627
I'm so sorry.
I just let somebody in.

30:42.727 --> 30:44.396
It's really bad.
It's okay. It's okay.

30:44.497 --> 30:46.300
I-I'll take care of it.
Make sure they sit next to us.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.938
Okay.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.507
Hey, Brenda.

30:49.607 --> 30:50.776
I-I got us good chairs.
You--you ready?

30:50.810 --> 30:52.346
- Brenda, why don't you
come over here and we can, uh--

30:52.379 --> 30:53.882
we can, uh, sit together.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.151
We can get to know each other.
No, Dan. Dan, no.

30:55.185 --> 30:57.155
- We split couples up sometimes
to sit together, Allen.

30:57.255 --> 30:58.626
- Brenda, I'm Dianna,
Ron's wife.

30:58.659 --> 31:00.362
We've saved two seats
for you over here.

31:00.395 --> 31:01.464
You don't mind, do you, Dan?
Of course not.

31:01.498 --> 31:03.569
Of course not, Dianna.
- You want the chair?

31:03.669 --> 31:06.341
- Yes, I'll have the chair.
- So nice to meet you!

31:06.374 --> 31:08.244
- Have you met everyone?
- Uh, gosh.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.948
I think so.
It's impossible.

31:09.981 --> 31:11.283
There's so many people,
and just when you think

31:11.383 --> 31:13.454
you've got them all,
there's more.

31:13.555 --> 31:15.191
Honestly, I'm not--
Uh, let me get that.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.293
Oh, sorry.

31:17.663 --> 31:19.267
Welcome to Utah,
Miss Potato Head.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.505
Oh!
- You're from Idaho, right?

31:21.538 --> 31:23.307
Are you poking fun?
- Here, take that for me.

31:23.407 --> 31:24.677
Just a little bit, okay?

31:24.777 --> 31:27.215
- Well, you'd be surprised
how much math and science

31:27.315 --> 31:29.153
goes into a good potato,
mister.

31:29.186 --> 31:31.023
- Really? How much?
- I-I don't know.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.662
'cause for your information,
I'm not going into soil science

31:33.762 --> 31:36.234
like my very smart father.
Okay.

31:36.267 --> 31:37.403
- Yeah, I'm going
into television.

31:37.436 --> 31:38.404
- Wow!
- By the way you look,

31:38.505 --> 31:39.541
you must be an actress.

31:39.641 --> 31:41.477
- Oh, gosh. No. No.
- No?

31:41.578 --> 31:43.415
- No, I, um--I-I read the news.

31:43.448 --> 31:44.416
How exciting.

31:44.517 --> 31:46.689
- Well, I-I'd like to
one day.

31:46.722 --> 31:49.126
Till I start a family,
of course, and, you know,

31:49.159 --> 31:50.530
then I'll take a little break.

31:50.563 --> 31:52.399
Nothing wrong with having
it all, now, is there?

31:52.432 --> 31:54.403
- Don't listen to him.
He's just teasing.

31:54.436 --> 31:56.407
He's just in construction.
No.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.445
He started the best
construction company in Utah.

31:58.478 --> 31:59.648
- Of course.
I'm sorry.

31:59.681 --> 32:01.718
- Actually, we saw your
new place, uh, on the way here.

32:01.818 --> 32:03.722
- What'd you think?
- Yeah, it's great. Isn't it?

32:03.822 --> 32:04.724
- Oh, yeah.

32:04.758 --> 32:07.163
- Uh, Ron, uh, sits
on the city council.

32:07.196 --> 32:09.968
Uh, he's the first counselor
in his bishopric, and...

32:10.068 --> 32:11.638
- Keep going. You're making me
sound impressive.

32:13.943 --> 32:15.579
- Uh, Brenda's Potato Head dad
is a bishop.

32:15.679 --> 32:16.581
- Is that right?

32:16.681 --> 32:18.184
- Oh, yeah, well,

32:18.284 --> 32:19.453
he's not on any city council

32:19.554 --> 32:21.057
and doesn't build fourplexes,
so...

32:21.090 --> 32:23.529
How do you make time
for it all and family?

32:23.629 --> 32:25.199
- Oh, there's plenty of time
later.

32:25.232 --> 32:27.002
You know,
eternity lasts forever.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.972
- Oh, my gosh.
You sound just like my dad.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.143
- I gotta--I'm--I'm gonna
be back in a minute.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.078
- All right.
- Okay? Sorry.

32:35.385 --> 32:37.355
- He's cute, isn't he?

32:37.455 --> 32:40.028
- I have the oldest,

32:40.061 --> 32:41.263
and you grab the youngest,

32:41.363 --> 32:43.535
and then we can compare notes.

32:43.635 --> 32:46.240
- I hear you met our Allen
in--oh, sorry.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.743
I hate it when I do that.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.581
Um, I hear you met
our Allen in--in church.

32:49.614 --> 32:51.619
Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I met my Dan in church, too,

32:51.652 --> 32:53.355
when he was on his mission
in Scotland.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.092
- Oh! Oh, I didn't think
you're allowed

32:55.125 --> 32:56.327
to marry your missionary.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.597
Whoo-ee.

32:57.630 --> 33:00.001
- I think I need
some lemonade.

33:00.101 --> 33:01.136
- What?

33:01.236 --> 33:02.439
What?

33:03.341 --> 33:05.379
- Mm.
- Oh.

33:05.412 --> 33:07.249
You two, he was your--

33:08.786 --> 33:10.656
Oh.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.560
- But me and Dan
did no such thing.

33:12.660 --> 33:15.499
My girls
have a-a different daddy,

33:15.599 --> 33:17.235
and Dan gave me
a second shot at life,

33:17.335 --> 33:18.438
saved me from all my shame.

33:18.471 --> 33:20.275
No shame in divorce
if he divorced a Catholic,

33:20.375 --> 33:21.444
right, Matilda?

33:21.545 --> 33:24.149
- Well, Dan actually
fancied my sister first,

33:24.249 --> 33:25.218
not me.

33:25.251 --> 33:26.789
He even gave her the holy dunk.

33:26.822 --> 33:28.358
Who knows what else
he gave her?

33:28.391 --> 33:29.694
No, no.

33:29.794 --> 33:31.531
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

33:31.631 --> 33:33.602
Um, who knows
what they got up to?

33:33.702 --> 33:35.271
Just prayers, lots of prayers.

33:35.371 --> 33:36.641
Could I--
- Yes.

33:38.812 --> 33:41.183
Don't worry.
You're the star here tonight.

33:41.283 --> 33:43.121
Enjoy every moment.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.390
Matilda just gets excited.

33:45.793 --> 33:47.195
How are you?

33:53.642 --> 33:55.112
- Here's the roast.
- Ah.

33:55.145 --> 33:57.283
Thank you.
It's ready.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.294
Oh. Suppertime.

34:05.165 --> 34:07.168
Whoo! Wow.

34:11.276 --> 34:12.713
- Everything okay?

34:12.813 --> 34:14.116
Thank you.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.191
Don't you look a dream?

34:19.393 --> 34:21.463
Yeah!

34:23.569 --> 34:25.172
And as much as we'd all
love to, uh--

34:25.205 --> 34:29.212
well, to make a late night
of it, we cannot.

34:29.312 --> 34:33.522
We have been called to service

34:33.622 --> 34:36.193
for our brother.

34:36.293 --> 34:39.266
Now, yes, our old neighbor
and I have had our feuds,

34:39.366 --> 34:40.602
earthly and spiritual.

34:40.702 --> 34:42.773
With no family left
to call on,

34:42.873 --> 34:45.879
he's come asking for
forgiveness and deliverance.

34:45.979 --> 34:50.455
And I told him forgiveness
is not mine to give...

34:50.488 --> 34:53.528
but deliverance, well...

34:54.597 --> 34:56.768
We are Laffertys.

34:56.868 --> 35:00.108
And much of his land
remains filled with stones,

35:00.208 --> 35:01.210
but he's been notified

35:03.749 --> 35:07.623
or the federal government will
take what is rightfully his

35:07.723 --> 35:10.194
to build a highway.

35:10.896 --> 35:14.638
Yes, the Lord's saints
may disagree with one another,

35:14.671 --> 35:17.576
but when we are attacked
by outsiders,

35:17.676 --> 35:21.250
do we allow our brothers
to be eaten alive?

35:21.350 --> 35:22.553
Never.

35:22.653 --> 35:23.923
Never.

35:26.661 --> 35:32.506
- The Lord's elect
must never allow anyone

35:32.606 --> 35:34.476
to take
what is rightfully ours.

35:35.412 --> 35:37.449
- So two days, then, sir, to--

35:37.550 --> 35:38.786
to clear
all the rest of his land.

35:38.819 --> 35:40.455
No, Robin, one day.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.259
As we do not labor on Sundays,

35:42.292 --> 35:43.662
all of it tomorrow.

35:43.762 --> 35:47.269
There's a reason
families 50 miles round

35:47.302 --> 35:49.206
have heard the Lafferty name.

35:49.306 --> 35:50.876
Because together...

35:50.976 --> 35:55.485
We can do anything.

36:00.796 --> 36:04.236
- Robin,
you'll say the blessing.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.471
- Yes, sir.

36:10.850 --> 36:14.489
Our dear heavenly Father,
we thank Thee.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.394
We thank Thee
for this glorious day,

36:16.427 --> 36:19.935
for this--this opportunity
to serve our fellow man

36:19.968 --> 36:21.839
in his hour of need.

36:21.872 --> 36:23.708
She saw herself as just--

36:23.808 --> 36:25.746
you know,
as faithful as they come.

36:25.846 --> 36:30.722
And in Idaho,
in her family, maybe, but--

36:30.822 --> 36:33.227
but in Utah, in ours...

36:33.327 --> 36:35.933
If we put our faith
in each other and in Thee,

36:35.966 --> 36:38.772
we ask Thee that Thou may be
with us with Thy Holy Spirit

36:38.872 --> 36:40.810
and make our labor light.

36:40.843 --> 36:44.283
It was my father
who caught it first.

36:44.316 --> 36:45.919
You know, the fact that she

36:46.019 --> 36:49.594
didn't see the rules
like he did...

36:49.627 --> 36:51.998
as unbending.

36:52.098 --> 36:53.902
He judged her for that.

36:54.002 --> 36:55.706
- How would you
have preferred her?

36:55.739 --> 36:57.275
- Hey, listen, listen.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.647
My--my opinions
did not get us here.

36:59.747 --> 37:01.651
Why don't you tell me?

37:01.751 --> 37:03.755
LDS women are--are...

37:03.855 --> 37:06.260
taught to--to be obedient,

37:06.360 --> 37:08.833
to serve their husband,

37:08.866 --> 37:10.001
to obey.

37:11.671 --> 37:14.710
And okay,
Brenda wasn't that.

37:16.615 --> 37:19.654
Did that make her
deserving of this?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.762
And--and my baby girl?

37:24.564 --> 37:26.869
- No...

37:26.902 --> 37:28.538
Allen.

37:29.541 --> 37:32.880
- Then you might not be
as good a Mormon as you think.

37:44.771 --> 37:47.408
Good Mormons, we--

37:47.509 --> 37:50.682
they like to think of
themselves as one big family,

37:50.782 --> 37:52.921
that together,
we can do anything.

37:52.954 --> 37:55.592
But aren't we also taught
there can only be

37:55.692 --> 37:58.499
one prophet, one leader?

38:00.401 --> 38:02.005
- Come on, drink. Drink!

38:02.105 --> 38:04.476
Come on, it's hot out here.
Drink!

38:11.189 --> 38:12.760
- All right, listen up.

38:12.860 --> 38:16.400
"When the brethren
show a unity of purpose,

38:16.433 --> 38:20.341
"our labor, our toil,
and anxiety are diminished.

38:20.441 --> 38:23.715
Our yoke is made easy
and our burden light."

38:23.815 --> 38:26.387
- Listen, drink up.
Listen, everybody.

38:26.420 --> 38:29.828
No one is allowed to pee until
we've cleared the entire field.

38:29.861 --> 38:31.598
You hear me?
Not a soul.

38:31.698 --> 38:32.766
Not even you, little one.

38:32.866 --> 38:34.737
- Oh, come on, now!

38:58.619 --> 39:00.088
Got all day. Come on!

39:13.649 --> 39:14.817
- Come on.

39:30.749 --> 39:32.485
- What is she doing?

39:34.824 --> 39:36.794
I got one!

39:36.894 --> 39:38.898
- Big one!
- All right!

39:40.168 --> 39:42.840
Big one!

40:02.813 --> 40:04.550
- Allen, I just wanna say
you did a great job today

40:04.650 --> 40:05.719
driving the tractor.

40:05.819 --> 40:08.190
What the heck? Dan!

40:09.660 --> 40:11.196
It's not funny.

40:26.561 --> 40:30.535
I am so proud...

40:31.905 --> 40:33.908
Of my family today.

40:35.546 --> 40:38.083
Look at what you have done.

40:41.591 --> 40:43.061
Mm.

40:43.094 --> 40:44.196
Yes.

40:44.229 --> 40:47.201
Now I feel
I can share our news.

40:48.104 --> 40:51.878
Your mother and I have
been called by the prophet...

40:53.247 --> 40:55.251
On a senior mission.

40:56.855 --> 40:57.990
It is a great honor.

41:01.698 --> 41:04.103
But we've never left you

41:04.136 --> 41:06.507
or our business unattended,

41:06.607 --> 41:08.177
let alone for two years.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.225
And, boys...

41:15.258 --> 41:18.998
Unattended property
can grow busy with weeds.

41:21.170 --> 41:24.878
No matter how pretty
our property may be,

41:24.911 --> 41:29.285
our property must be
vigilantly maintained.

41:31.624 --> 41:33.595
And with challenging
economic conditions,

41:33.695 --> 41:35.264
it is not an ideal time.

41:38.070 --> 41:42.880
Someone must stand in my shoes
while we're away.

41:44.082 --> 41:47.055
I prayed for wisdom,

41:47.155 --> 41:49.259
and the Holy Spirit answered.

41:53.768 --> 41:56.641
Dan has never been
singularly focused on anything.

41:58.343 --> 42:01.818
But he's graduated
from chiropractic school now.

42:02.786 --> 42:05.992
He is my eldest son
to follow in my footsteps.

42:06.092 --> 42:07.997
I'm moved by that.

42:15.010 --> 42:19.219
We will all put our faith

42:19.319 --> 42:20.555
in Dan...

42:22.325 --> 42:24.797
To head our family
and our family business

42:24.897 --> 42:26.567
in my absence.

42:26.667 --> 42:29.740
Robin, you will be

42:29.840 --> 42:32.746
Dan's right hand.

42:32.846 --> 42:34.349
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

42:36.353 --> 42:39.325
- Jacob, Sam...

42:41.330 --> 42:44.670
I want to see
our home in better condition

42:44.770 --> 42:46.675
than how I leave it.

42:46.708 --> 42:48.277
Hmm?

42:48.377 --> 42:49.312
And, Allen...

42:51.149 --> 42:53.789
You seem to have
your hands quite full.

42:53.822 --> 42:56.661
Keep working on that.

42:56.694 --> 42:58.832
- Yes, sir.

43:07.048 --> 43:08.150
Hmm.

43:12.091 --> 43:15.666
Dan, you say the prayer.

43:15.699 --> 43:19.807
- Dear heavenly Father,
I'd like to thank Thee

43:19.840 --> 43:24.382
for having faith in me

43:24.482 --> 43:27.321
and for choosing me.

43:29.359 --> 43:33.200
I'd like to ask for--
for guidance

43:33.300 --> 43:36.339
while our parents are away.

43:36.439 --> 43:40.983
And I mean, as much
as they had their eyes on her,

43:41.016 --> 43:42.887
she had hers on us.

44:05.732 --> 44:07.101
- Thank you.

44:07.201 --> 44:08.437
It's you.

44:09.607 --> 44:12.112
You're the fulfillment
of heavenly Father's promise...

44:16.186 --> 44:18.825
That He would send
one mighty and strong

44:18.925 --> 44:20.261
to set things in order.

44:20.294 --> 44:24.102
I mean, he sent me
six mighty and strong, but...

44:26.975 --> 44:28.343
You're my one.

44:31.049 --> 44:34.690
You'll lead this family one--
- Shh.

44:39.065 --> 44:40.869
- So don't let
your father sway you

44:40.969 --> 44:43.407
from that righteous calling.

44:43.508 --> 44:45.144
It's yours.

44:49.954 --> 44:51.490
- Yeah.

44:51.524 --> 44:53.695
- Sir, your wife
gave me an address.

44:53.795 --> 44:56.935
Whose?
- Robin Lafferty's, sir.

44:56.968 --> 44:58.370
- I'll check it out.

44:59.507 --> 45:03.013
- May your heavenly Father
be with him.

45:20.515 --> 45:21.951
- So when you stopped
going to church,

45:21.984 --> 45:23.855
is that about the time
you stopped seeing

45:23.955 --> 45:25.859
your family and your brothers?

45:25.959 --> 45:26.994
- I mean...

45:28.498 --> 45:30.367
Yeah, that sounds about right.

45:33.207 --> 45:34.810
- You ever miss the church?

45:38.183 --> 45:39.385
- Yes.

45:42.392 --> 45:43.895
- Which parts?

45:47.402 --> 45:49.138
- What we learned as boys...

45:51.410 --> 45:55.050
Our larger LDS family...

45:55.919 --> 45:58.490
The idea that we had
each other's backs.

46:00.829 --> 46:04.268
And most of all, uh,
what I miss...

46:04.368 --> 46:06.975
are the days when I

46:07.008 --> 46:09.880
still believed
our God was love.

46:13.253 --> 46:16.160
"If any of you lack wisdom,

46:16.193 --> 46:20.167
let him ask of God,
and it shall be given Him."

46:20.267 --> 46:24.108
And when Joseph
asked about his salvation...

46:24.208 --> 46:25.913
Two personages

46:25.946 --> 46:27.415
whose brightness
defy description

46:27.448 --> 46:29.352
stood above me.

46:29.452 --> 46:32.324
So I asked...

46:32.424 --> 46:34.095
which church is true?

46:35.297 --> 46:38.572
And the Lord said..."None."

46:38.605 --> 46:41.844
Joseph Smith,
at only 15 years old,

46:41.944 --> 46:44.917
set forth to create
his one true church.

46:44.950 --> 46:46.053
Why?

46:46.086 --> 46:48.457
What drove him?

46:48.490 --> 46:50.829
It was love.

46:50.929 --> 46:52.833
- A light filled my room.

46:54.169 --> 46:58.611
A messenger told me
God has a work for me,

46:58.711 --> 47:02.418
that there's a book
buried in the ground

47:02.519 --> 47:04.355
where the fullness
of His Gospel

47:04.455 --> 47:06.527
is written on golden plates.

47:06.627 --> 47:09.600
- And the Holy Spirit told him
to marry Emma,

47:09.633 --> 47:12.973
that with her love,

47:13.073 --> 47:15.477
God would share
His most sacred truths.

47:16.446 --> 47:18.150
- If our God is love...

47:19.587 --> 47:23.561
Then He fills my heart...
with you.

47:24.964 --> 47:26.600
That is the church I miss.

47:35.484 --> 47:37.990
But that's not where
our history ends, is it?

47:39.259 --> 47:42.633
Mountain Meadows, 1859.

47:42.666 --> 47:44.903
Do you know what Major Carlton
found there?

47:45.003 --> 47:48.878
What was ordered done
to those innocent Gentiles

47:48.978 --> 47:52.451
and their children
in the name of God?

48:01.671 --> 48:03.406
I asked you a question.
Uh, that's enough.

48:04.075 --> 48:06.146
You're just throwing up dust,
Allen.

48:06.246 --> 48:07.616
I don't need to hear
any more stories.

48:07.716 --> 48:09.452
- I wish they'd...
- Hey--

48:09.553 --> 48:10.989
- Ask her bishop, but he--

48:11.022 --> 48:12.358
he probably
doesn't know either.

48:15.532 --> 48:17.468
They've hidden our truth

48:17.569 --> 48:20.140
with their
secret combinations.

48:21.309 --> 48:24.683
If you really still believe
your God is love,

48:24.783 --> 48:29.025
then you don't know
who you are...brother.

48:29.627 --> 48:34.302
This faith...our faith,

48:34.402 --> 48:36.273
breeds dangerous men.

49:02.291 --> 49:04.195
This is Jeb.
Yeah, just checking.

49:04.295 --> 49:05.965
Well, good Mormons
don't leave for Disneyland

49:06.065 --> 49:07.703
with a fire burning
in their backyard,

49:07.736 --> 49:09.740
food left to rot
in the kitchen trash.

49:09.773 --> 49:11.343
- This is starting
to feel bigger

49:11.376 --> 49:13.582
than a domestic to me, Bill.

49:13.615 --> 49:15.451
You know, that house is only
20 minutes away from Allen's.

49:15.484 --> 49:17.590
No doubt the rest of his kin
are just as close.

49:17.623 --> 49:19.459
- Listen,
don't complicate things

49:19.492 --> 49:21.262
before we have hard evidence.

49:21.362 --> 49:24.169
I'll dust for prints,
see if your suspect there

49:24.202 --> 49:25.470
was even in this house
tonight.

49:27.074 --> 49:28.376
You need to trust me on this.

49:28.476 --> 49:30.180
I've walked this road before.

49:32.118 --> 49:33.621
- Good.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.625
See you soon.

49:52.124 --> 49:53.193
Hello?

49:53.293 --> 49:54.997
- Mr. Wright?

49:55.097 --> 49:58.236
Detective Taba
from East Rockwell, Utah.

49:58.771 --> 50:01.644
I'm so sorry to notify you
of this, sir.

50:01.677 --> 50:03.748
But we found your daughter

50:03.781 --> 50:07.021
and her child
earlier this evening.

50:12.465 --> 50:14.503
- Hey, just got off the phone
with Kimberly, Idaho Police.

50:14.536 --> 50:17.676
You notify the victim's father
without my go-ahead?

50:17.776 --> 50:20.515
How many homicides
have you processed before?

50:20.548 --> 50:22.418
I've seen more
than I can count.

50:22.451 --> 50:24.523
And I thought it was high time
that we start following

50:24.556 --> 50:26.192
a normal order of operations.

50:26.292 --> 50:27.662
- I was waiting till I had
every question at the ready

50:27.762 --> 50:29.767
so I didn't have
to call him twice.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.670
I asked you to knock on doors
and find me Laffertys

50:31.770 --> 50:33.139
and that's all.

50:33.239 --> 50:34.508
- There's ten new Laffertys
at every split

50:34.508 --> 50:36.136
of their damn family tree.
- Welcome to Mormondom!

50:36.136 --> 50:37.382
You're not in Vegas
anymore, pal,

50:37.382 --> 50:40.454
and you are not in charge here.

50:41.122 --> 50:43.828
- Detective,
I'm well aware of my skin.

50:43.928 --> 50:45.298
It's darker
than most in this valley.

50:45.331 --> 50:47.201
- What?
And I'm very well aware

50:47.301 --> 50:50.141
that's not smiled upon
in a 99% LDS town.

50:50.174 --> 50:52.178
Oh, come on.
- But I know cases like this

50:52.211 --> 50:53.848
a hell of a lot better
than you do.

50:53.881 --> 50:55.752
- Right now,
we have four prints,

50:55.852 --> 50:57.622
and we have one suspect
in custody.

50:57.722 --> 50:59.492
- Four partial handprints.

50:59.593 --> 51:01.497
I could make four partials
with my two hands,

51:01.597 --> 51:02.432
and so could your boy in there.

51:02.533 --> 51:05.237
- And it's a lot easier
with four hands.

51:05.839 --> 51:07.441
- Fair enough,

51:07.542 --> 51:09.312
but we only have 18 officers,

51:09.412 --> 51:12.084
and most of them have never
even seen a dead body.

51:12.184 --> 51:14.155
So before I wasted
one more of your men

51:14.188 --> 51:16.193
on wake-up calls in a town
that's asleep by00,

51:16.226 --> 51:18.732
I thought it was smart
to talk to one actual source.

51:18.765 --> 51:20.233
And guess what.

51:21.871 --> 51:23.306
You're welcome.

51:31.356 --> 51:33.259
- Your father-in-law
just told us

51:33.359 --> 51:35.665
that Brenda took her sister
out for ice cream

51:35.765 --> 51:37.736
a few months back
and that she said

51:37.769 --> 51:42.211
that she was afraid of you
because you...

51:42.244 --> 51:43.748
beat on her.

51:43.848 --> 51:45.451
So who am I supposed
to believe,

51:45.484 --> 51:49.660
her bishop dad or you
and your tales of romance?

51:49.760 --> 51:53.400
- Well, I-I did not
beat on her.

51:54.302 --> 51:56.607
- Of course you didn't.
So her father is lying?

51:56.640 --> 51:58.309
- That's not what I'm saying.

51:59.780 --> 52:03.387
Uh, we got in--in one fight...

52:03.420 --> 52:05.391
and I regret that.

52:05.424 --> 52:10.400
But I can say that I'm not
the first man in history

52:10.501 --> 52:12.772
to not be well-liked
by his father-in-law.

52:14.676 --> 52:16.212
Isaac Hale...

52:17.749 --> 52:19.620
He was Emma's father.

52:19.653 --> 52:21.624
He thought Joseph
was a con man.

52:21.657 --> 52:23.293
- Allen, what are you doing?

52:23.393 --> 52:27.368
- So when Joseph
asked Emma to marry him...

52:29.305 --> 52:31.476
Tell me,
who is the higher power,

52:31.577 --> 52:34.281
my father or God?

52:34.381 --> 52:37.488
- If Joseph had put
her father's words above God's,

52:37.589 --> 52:39.425
would you have
your one true church?

52:41.296 --> 52:42.800
No.

52:42.833 --> 52:46.272
When I met my wife,
my testimony was strong.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.679
So I refused to let
her father's opinion sway me.

52:49.779 --> 52:52.217
That does not make me a killer.

52:52.317 --> 52:54.790
- Yeah, well, cutting the cord
off your vacuum cleaner

52:54.823 --> 52:55.958
and tying it
around your wife's neck

52:56.058 --> 52:57.629
before you sliced her throat

52:57.729 --> 53:00.200
and beheaded your own
15-month-old daughter

53:00.300 --> 53:01.904
does, you fucking
piece of shit.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.440
Hey.

53:03.541 --> 53:04.509
Hey.

53:07.381 --> 53:09.519
In the few instances
we've had an innocent man,

53:09.619 --> 53:12.458
an actual innocent man,
sat where you are,

53:12.491 --> 53:13.962
they've been jumping
up and down.

53:13.995 --> 53:15.197
They've been naming people.

53:15.297 --> 53:16.934
Instead you sit there and you
tell us that you're concerned

53:16.967 --> 53:18.403
about your brothers

53:18.436 --> 53:20.307
who couldn't keep their eyes
off of her,

53:20.407 --> 53:22.244
and your father
thought she was no good.

53:22.344 --> 53:23.881
And you know what?
If I were you, I would--

53:23.981 --> 53:27.990
I would rather find
that kind of family dead

53:28.023 --> 53:30.528
rather than safe and sound.

53:31.730 --> 53:33.399
Did you harm your brothers
tonight too, Allen?

53:33.500 --> 53:35.003
- No, I did not.

53:35.103 --> 53:37.909
And I will say it
until you hear me.

53:38.009 --> 53:42.886
Men with beards
corrupted my family.

53:42.919 --> 53:45.825
And every second
you waste in here with me,

53:45.925 --> 53:47.862
your--your Holy Spirit
is out there

53:47.962 --> 53:51.336
persuading more men of God
to spill more blood!

53:51.369 --> 53:53.339
Sit down!

53:54.743 --> 53:57.381
- And I'm sorry...

53:57.481 --> 53:58.483
sir.

53:59.485 --> 54:03.360
If you insist
on believing in a Mormon God,

54:03.393 --> 54:04.897
then go.

54:04.930 --> 54:07.569
Go and pray to Him,

54:07.669 --> 54:09.438
like Joseph taught you to.

54:10.775 --> 54:13.681
Ask Him for wisdom.

55:18.009 --> 55:20.715
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:22.184 --> 55:25.056
I was, uh, just putting
the APB out,

55:25.156 --> 55:27.829
missing persons,
on Robin and his family.

55:27.862 --> 55:31.002
Should I put one out
for bearded vagrants as well?

55:36.747 --> 55:38.416
- Yeah.
- All right.

55:45.097 --> 55:46.833
- Autopsies are scheduled
for- 00 a.m.

55:46.933 --> 55:49.706
Blood and prints
should be ready by then too.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.845
Keep pushing the kid or wait?

55:57.656 --> 56:00.861
- Uh, you know, out in Florida,

56:00.961 --> 56:03.534
Henry Lee Lucas
claimed he killed 60 people

56:03.567 --> 56:05.504
once he started
telling the truth,

56:05.604 --> 56:07.441
all satanic ritual slaughter.

56:07.474 --> 56:09.580
- Savage.

56:09.613 --> 56:11.415
Where'd you go on your mission?

56:12.719 --> 56:14.589
- Denver.

56:14.689 --> 56:17.160
Well, maybe Denver
gets the stray satanist

56:17.260 --> 56:19.164
but not Salt Lake City suburbs.

56:19.264 --> 56:20.635
Well...

56:21.770 --> 56:23.975
Two years ago,
a man named Arthur Bishop,

56:24.008 --> 56:26.580
he lures five boys
away from their families

56:26.613 --> 56:28.416
right here in Utah.

56:28.517 --> 56:30.622
And out
where my folks' farm is,

56:30.655 --> 56:32.558
young girl was kidnapped.

56:32.658 --> 56:34.663
Found her body in a stream,
and a week later,

56:34.763 --> 56:37.635
someone had left black roses
on her grave

56:37.735 --> 56:39.940
with a letter
with an inverted cross.

56:40.040 --> 56:42.980
Devil worship, satanic panic,
whatever you wanna call it,

56:43.013 --> 56:45.719
Allen has already admitted that
he's lost his faith, and, um--

56:45.752 --> 56:47.421
Well, if a lack of LDS faith

56:47.522 --> 56:48.457
gets a man convicted,

56:48.558 --> 56:51.162
whole lot of people
heading to Draper prison,

56:51.195 --> 56:52.765
me included.
I'm not saying that.

56:52.865 --> 56:55.103
I'm saying leaving the church,

56:55.203 --> 56:57.742
that would have created
a lot of grief in his family.

56:59.913 --> 57:02.585
They would have put
a lot of pressure on him to...

57:02.685 --> 57:04.455
return, to--

57:04.556 --> 57:05.925
to save themselves
the humiliation

57:05.958 --> 57:07.160
of a wayward son.

57:09.766 --> 57:12.104
Good thing I voted for Nixon.

57:12.204 --> 57:13.540
But what if--what if--

57:13.640 --> 57:15.443
what if he cracked?

57:15.544 --> 57:17.516
He cracked
under all their pressure

57:17.549 --> 57:19.451
and he killed his whole family,

57:19.552 --> 57:21.657
he saved his wife and daughter
for last,

57:21.690 --> 57:23.594
and he walks
across the street,

57:23.694 --> 57:25.463
lets someone know
his deed was done?

57:25.564 --> 57:26.633
They wanna be caught, right?

57:26.667 --> 57:30.675
The credit, the attention,
sociopath handbook 101.

57:30.708 --> 57:33.681
- We deal in what is, not ifs.

57:33.714 --> 57:35.016
Let's say you're right.

57:36.185 --> 57:37.955
If we don't charge him
in the next 36 hours,

57:38.055 --> 57:39.827
he can walk
just right out of here.

57:39.860 --> 57:41.128
And when the chief comes back--

57:41.228 --> 57:43.199
- Well, the chief's not
due back from Yellowstone

57:43.299 --> 57:45.470
for another week, so...

57:45.571 --> 57:47.509
- Listen, things like this,

57:47.542 --> 57:48.945
they don't stay under wraps
for very long.

57:48.978 --> 57:52.786
If this kid's family
is as well-liked as you say,

57:52.819 --> 57:55.658
when the chief, the DA,
or the press gets wind of it,

57:55.691 --> 57:58.230
they're gonna demand answers
and a suspect.

57:58.263 --> 58:00.868
And if you don't wanna look
like a couple of screwups,

58:00.968 --> 58:04.174
you wanna keep panic
from ripping through this town,

58:04.274 --> 58:05.711
we need a suspect.

58:10.688 --> 58:11.957
It's eating you alive,
isn't it?

58:13.594 --> 58:14.696
- What?

58:14.796 --> 58:16.566
All you gotta do
is ask nice, Jeb.

58:17.569 --> 58:19.706
"Can I have some fries, Bill?"

58:21.943 --> 58:23.714
Bill, those things
are gonna kill you.

58:23.814 --> 58:25.684
- Well, let's die happy.

58:28.289 --> 58:29.993
Mmm.

58:31.864 --> 58:33.801
It's our little secret.

58:37.876 --> 58:39.679
You're a bad influence, Bill.

58:39.779 --> 58:42.084
- Thank you.

58:42.184 --> 58:43.052
Detective?

58:50.133 --> 58:51.837
- Detective Taba.

58:51.870 --> 58:54.843
I'm looking at him
now in my lot.

58:54.876 --> 58:57.047
Oh, he fits the APB
I heard off my scanner.

58:57.147 --> 58:59.652
- Does he have a beard?
Yeah.

58:59.752 --> 59:02.625
And black, like soot,
on his hands.

59:02.725 --> 59:03.961
- What's your location?

1:00:02.946 --> 1:00:04.950
Sorry to disturb you.

1:00:04.983 --> 1:00:07.387
Detective Taba
from East Rockwell Police.

1:00:08.356 --> 1:00:10.828
Is it just you and your kids
alone here, ma'am?

1:00:10.928 --> 1:00:13.700
Is there a problem?
- No husband?

1:00:15.003 --> 1:00:17.708
- We had an electrical problem
at home.

1:00:19.913 --> 1:00:22.150
- Excuse me.
Hey.

1:00:22.250 --> 1:00:24.421
Come here. Come here, guys.
Together.

1:00:24.522 --> 1:00:25.724
You're okay.
I got you.

1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:29.766
Out the back. Go! Go, go!

1:00:33.273 --> 1:00:34.308
Freeze!

1:00:38.349 --> 1:00:39.986
Stop right there!

1:00:40.086 --> 1:00:41.756
Hands on your head!

1:00:41.856 --> 1:00:43.728
Put your hands
on your head right now!

1:00:45.129 --> 1:00:47.869
Don't be stupid.
Put your hands on your head.

1:00:47.969 --> 1:00:49.137
- And show these men

1:00:49.237 --> 1:00:51.109
that they are not in line
with Thy Gospel.

1:00:51.142 --> 1:00:53.747
Show these men that they are
the wickedness of the state.

1:00:53.847 --> 1:00:55.016
Put your hands on your head,

1:00:55.116 --> 1:00:56.887
or I will kick
the shit out of you.

1:00:57.421 --> 1:00:59.125
- In Jesus Christ's name,
we pray.

1:00:59.158 --> 1:01:00.159
Amen.

1:01:01.863 --> 1:01:03.266
State your name.

1:01:03.299 --> 1:01:05.705
- My name is Robin Lafferty.

1:01:16.325 --> 1:01:17.695
Officer Denney,

1:01:17.795 --> 1:01:19.097
escort our new friend
to my car.

1:01:20.133 --> 1:01:21.402
Detective.

1:01:22.137 --> 1:01:25.010
You once went to church
with these boys.

1:01:25.043 --> 1:01:28.751
They may know your face,
your family.

1:01:28.784 --> 1:01:31.188
Go home.
Make sure they're safe.

1:01:32.959 --> 1:01:34.729
I'll handle this from here.

1:02:00.447 --> 1:02:01.449
- Jeb.
- Hey!

1:02:01.482 --> 1:02:04.055
- Oh! Oh!
- Shoot.

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:05.423
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

1:02:05.524 --> 1:02:06.993
Hi, Mom. Hi.

1:02:07.093 --> 1:02:09.432
Just wanted to be
a nice surprise.

1:02:09.465 --> 1:02:11.135
- It was a lovely surprise.

1:02:11.235 --> 1:02:14.175
Oh, my sweetheart.

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:15.276
- Sit down.
I'll get you some milk.

1:02:15.376 --> 1:02:16.746
Sit down.

1:02:16.846 --> 1:02:17.815
Sit down, he tells me.

1:02:19.451 --> 1:02:21.488
Oh, nothing's right.

1:02:21.589 --> 1:02:24.095
It's all so broken.

1:02:24.128 --> 1:02:25.932
Remember what you told
us all about, uh,

1:02:25.965 --> 1:02:27.835
the broken things in life?

1:02:29.405 --> 1:02:32.043
How they're all just tests
for the next?

1:02:33.346 --> 1:02:34.850
Remember?

1:02:34.883 --> 1:02:36.251
- Yes.
You do?

1:02:36.351 --> 1:02:37.522
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:37.555 --> 1:02:40.193
- And that you said, um,

1:02:40.293 --> 1:02:42.966
in heaven,

1:02:42.999 --> 1:02:45.303
everything's gonna be perfect,

1:02:45.403 --> 1:02:50.380
our bodies...and our minds,

1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:53.854
and we're gonna get to be
with our whole family

1:02:53.887 --> 1:02:57.394
and with Dad,
all together for eternity.

1:02:59.164 --> 1:03:00.233
- Yes.

1:03:03.372 --> 1:03:05.410
He's gone, isn't he?

1:03:05.511 --> 1:03:07.247
Your dad?

1:03:09.351 --> 1:03:11.321
- Yeah, Mom.

1:03:11.421 --> 1:03:14.094
I'm sorry.
He died ten years ago.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.139
- I wanna be with him,

1:03:20.239 --> 1:03:23.079
and--and I wanna go now, Jeb,

1:03:23.179 --> 1:03:26.118
where things are right.

1:04:23.466 --> 1:04:25.170
"For behold,

1:04:25.203 --> 1:04:27.407
"I have refined thee.

1:04:27.508 --> 1:04:29.211
I have chosen thee."

1:04:30.113 --> 1:04:32.283
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:04:34.956 --> 1:04:36.960
Ah, this case...

1:04:39.666 --> 1:04:41.369
What if it's not
just a husband

1:04:41.402 --> 1:04:43.941
whose heart
turned against his wife?

1:04:43.974 --> 1:04:47.949
"I have chosen thee
in the furnace of affliction."

1:04:53.527 --> 1:04:56.666
"For behold,
I have refined thee.

1:04:56.766 --> 1:04:58.670
"I have chosen thee

1:04:58.770 --> 1:05:01.408
in the furnace of affliction."

1:05:06.385 --> 1:05:08.223
- What if it's not
some outside evil,

1:05:08.256 --> 1:05:09.959
some outside force...

1:05:12.632 --> 1:05:14.001
That's found its way here?

1:05:24.021 --> 1:05:26.693
What if tonight
is just the first edge

1:05:26.793 --> 1:05:28.429
of a bone that's--

1:05:33.272 --> 1:05:37.982
That's finally working its way
out of our own desert's floor?

1:08:01.603 --> 1:08:02.505
Backup. Backup.

1:08:02.538 --> 1:08:04.240
Calling County for backup.

1:08:04.842 --> 1:08:05.745
One of the suspects

1:08:05.778 --> 1:08:06.880
used a term:

1:08:06.913 --> 1:08:07.915
blood atonement.

1:08:07.948 --> 1:08:09.385
It all sounds pretty crazy

1:08:09.418 --> 1:08:10.220
if you ask me.

1:08:10.253 --> 1:08:11.455
But he didn't ask you.

1:08:11.656 --> 1:08:12.925
An evil presence

1:08:12.958 --> 1:08:14.160
is in his family.

1:08:15.196 --> 1:08:15.831
And this isn't

1:08:15.864 --> 1:08:17.166
the murder weapon.

1:08:17.835 --> 1:08:19.137
It's a threat.

1:08:19.939 --> 1:08:20.908
You leave the things

1:08:20.941 --> 1:08:22.276
you do not understand

1:08:23.179 --> 1:08:23.880
on a shelf.

1:08:25.517 --> 1:08:26.720
Is the multiple wives thing

1:08:26.753 --> 1:08:28.389
mandatory cause...

1:08:28.422 --> 1:08:28.957
If you want to get to the

1:08:28.990 --> 1:08:30.326
celestial kingdom it is.

1:08:30.694 --> 1:08:31.729
Don't you ever come back!

1:08:32.464 --> 1:08:33.934
You're not safe here.

1:08:33.967 --> 1:08:34.836
I'm going to put an end

1:08:34.869 --> 1:08:35.704
to this wickedness.

1:08:36.438 --> 1:08:37.708
A wrong turn here

1:08:38.442 --> 1:08:39.879
and a lot more people die.
