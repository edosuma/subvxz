00:04.070 --> 00:07.480
<b>Approximately thirty minutes after 
the Hunters entered the palace...</b>

00:09.000 --> 00:12.650
<b>As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,</b>

00:13.450 --> 00:18.060
<b>an immense number of citizens 
hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales</b>

00:18.550 --> 00:24.600
<b>still waited outside for the selection process 
that would turn them into soldier ants.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:33.530
<b>Meanwhile, a creature in the form that 
they would soon become began to stir.</b>

02:16.990 --> 02:22.030
<b>Breakdown x And x Awakening</b>

02:40.240 --> 02:42.550
<b>Okay, all charged up.</b>

03:14.000 --> 03:15.030
<b><i>Someone's watching me.</i></b>

03:16.350 --> 03:17.250
<b><i>And...</i></b>

03:19.310 --> 03:21.910
<b><i>It's probably someone I know.</i></b>

04:01.810 --> 04:03.010
<b><i>No one's there?</i></b>

04:44.420 --> 04:46.530
<b>While her appearance hadn't totally changed,</b>

04:46.780 --> 04:50.060
<b>Palm was clearly no longer the same person.</b>

04:50.800 --> 04:54.230
<b>And that greatly disturbed Killua.</b>

04:58.620 --> 05:00.240
<b><i>She was captured</i></b>

05:01.500 --> 05:03.070
<b><i>by the Royal Guard...</i></b>

05:04.190 --> 05:06.070
<b><i>And she's been transformed!</i></b>

05:07.260 --> 05:10.740
<b><i>If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,</i></b>

05:11.370 --> 05:12.710
<b><i>he won't be able to take it...</i></b>

05:14.230 --> 05:19.570
<b><i>There's no room left in his heart.</i></b>

05:20.410 --> 05:25.090
<b><i>If the transformation has 
reached as far as Palm's heart...</i></b>

05:29.340 --> 05:31.510
<b><i>I can see Gon completely breaking down!</i></b>

05:36.060 --> 05:39.610
<b><i>I must learn the answer.</i></b>

05:44.540 --> 05:45.790
<b><i>We still have a chance.</i></b>

05:46.250 --> 05:47.830
<b><i>Palm approached me herself!</i></b>

05:50.850 --> 05:51.870
<b>Palm?</b>

05:53.220 --> 05:55.570
<b><i>Palm must have sensed me</i></b>

05:55.570 --> 05:59.000
<b><i>before I noticed her watching me...</i></b>

06:00.440 --> 06:03.020
<b><i>Using that power she told us about before.</i></b>

06:05.250 --> 06:09.080
<b><i>Once I used my power, it was quite simple.</i></b>

06:10.890 --> 06:14.780
<b><i>I thought she could use some kind 
of divination to locate people.</i></b>

06:15.470 --> 06:17.890
<b><i>But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.</i></b>

06:19.560 --> 06:23.980
<b><i>From her position, Palm shouldn't 
have been able to see me...</i></b>

06:25.190 --> 06:29.250
<b><i>The only conclusion is that she was 
watching me by some other means.</i></b>

06:31.380 --> 06:35.290
<b><i>And if Palm were an enemy, 
she would have backed off...</i></b>

06:36.710 --> 06:39.910
<b><i>Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.</i></b>

06:40.340 --> 06:43.550
<b><i>And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't 
remember me anymore.</i></b>

06:44.080 --> 06:45.780
<b><i>Since she approached me,</i></b>

06:47.980 --> 06:49.300
<b><i>she must remember me...</i></b>

06:50.950 --> 06:52.510
<b><i>Remember us!</i></b>

06:56.030 --> 06:58.320
<b>Killua, yes?</b>

07:01.800 --> 07:03.090
<b><i>I knew it...</i></b>

07:05.290 --> 07:06.510
<b><i>She has her memories!</i></b>

07:09.140 --> 07:10.230
<b>Where's Gon?</b>

07:12.510 --> 07:16.950
<b>Once he's seen what I've 
become, will Gon hate me?</b>

07:19.810 --> 07:22.610
<b>Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.</b>

07:23.180 --> 07:27.090
<b>And you're assuming that he 
doesn't already hate you.</b>

07:28.220 --> 07:31.970
<b>You're always so spiteful...</b>

07:33.640 --> 07:35.350
<b>Well, it doesn't matter.</b>

07:35.920 --> 07:40.990
<b>I have nothing to gain from your pity.</b>

07:42.500 --> 07:44.000
<b>Where's Gon?</b>

07:45.290 --> 07:47.280
<b>Gon's with Pitou.</b>

07:47.700 --> 07:48.660
<b>He'sâ€”</b>

07:53.260 --> 07:54.740
<b><i>Why can she see me,</i></b>

07:56.420 --> 07:58.510
<b><i>but she can't see Gon?</i></b>

08:02.420 --> 08:03.750
<b>What's wrong?</b>

08:06.790 --> 08:09.250
<b>Was it chance that you happened to find me?</b>

08:09.990 --> 08:12.440
<b>Huh? What are you talking about?</b>

08:12.910 --> 08:16.010
<b>You're the one who turned the corner.</b>

08:16.540 --> 08:20.150
<b>Wrong! I sensed you watching me.</b>

08:20.670 --> 08:22.480
<b>That's why I came this way!</b>

08:24.040 --> 08:26.260
<b>You noticed me first.</b>

08:28.290 --> 08:29.760
<b>Why are you lying?</b>

08:33.760 --> 08:35.780
<b>Troublesome brat...</b>

08:36.670 --> 08:38.390
<b>Where's Gon?</b>

08:38.390 --> 08:40.400
<b>Answer my question first.</b>

08:43.500 --> 08:48.290
<b><i>Did I notice Palm watching me 
only when she physically saw me?</i></b>

08:49.350 --> 08:54.200
<b><i>Does that mean Palm actually 
saw me once, then immediately left?</i></b>

08:54.960 --> 08:58.510
<b><i>Then she used clairvoyance 
to watch me follow her,</i></b>

08:58.510 --> 09:01.770
<b><i>and turned around so it'd look 
like she was approaching me?</i></b>

09:06.210 --> 09:07.550
<b>For the last time...</b>

09:10.360 --> 09:11.940
<b>Where's Gon?</b>

09:16.800 --> 09:18.230
<b>I won't tell you.</b>

09:19.180 --> 09:21.200
<b>You're an enemy, aren't you?</b>

09:37.790 --> 09:41.200
<b>I made a mistake...</b>

09:42.520 --> 09:45.100
<b>I used my power incorrectly.</b>

09:45.800 --> 09:48.960
<b>When I was brimming with rage,</b>

09:51.020 --> 09:54.610
<b>I should have let my emotions take over!</b>

10:00.160 --> 10:02.620
<b>Black Widow
Dark Demon Goddess</b>

10:03.930 --> 10:06.600
<b><i>Sh-She's dangerous!</i></b>

10:07.830 --> 10:11.380
<b>Better to let everything out than hold it in.</b>

10:13.540 --> 10:17.670
<b>That includes my desire to kill you!</b>

10:39.260 --> 10:41.620
<b>Well? What now?</b>

10:44.270 --> 10:45.910
<b>Will you die without a word?</b>

10:46.640 --> 10:48.500
<b>Will you die after speaking?</b>

11:05.160 --> 11:08.660
<b>Or will you just die?</b>

11:26.350 --> 11:30.810
<b>Palm's ability to arm herself by covering 
her body with her hair, Black Widow,</b>

11:30.810 --> 11:33.830
<b>varied in appearance according
to her emotional state.</b>

11:34.070 --> 11:37.510
<b>But defense was its primary function.</b>

11:39.980 --> 11:41.840
<b>What made Black Widow frightening</b>

11:42.960 --> 11:47.980
<b>was the fact that she could rely on 
her hair armor for protection,</b>

11:48.470 --> 11:51.600
<b>allowing her to devote all 
her energy to her attacks.</b>

12:07.010 --> 12:09.370
<b><i>P-Palm-san! Turn off your </i>Hatsu!</b>

12:11.490 --> 12:13.550
<b><i>Palm is an Enhancer.</i></b>

12:14.130 --> 12:17.880
<b><i>When everything clicks, it's possible 
to become this much stronger?</i></b>

12:19.150 --> 12:21.930
<b><i>I completely blocked the attack, 
but I still took damage.</i></b>

12:23.460 --> 12:27.010
<b><i>If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage.</i></b>

12:27.750 --> 12:30.560
<b><i>But I can't run away.</i></b>

12:31.730 --> 12:34.990
<b><i>Gon's mind is already at its limit!</i></b>

12:35.420 --> 12:39.010
<b><i>He's barely holding himself together, 
while he waits for Pitou.</i></b>

12:47.320 --> 12:49.030
<b><i>I can't let them meet.</i></b>

12:50.070 --> 12:53.120
<b><i>Even if Palm's heart is still there...</i></b>

12:57.060 --> 12:58.510
<b><i>It'll have a negative effect now!</i></b>

13:15.610 --> 13:16.600
<b>Palm!</b>

13:18.250 --> 13:20.420
<b>Why are you looking for Gon?</b>

13:20.420 --> 13:23.570
<b>Depending on why, I might be 
willing to tell you where he is.</b>

13:24.350 --> 13:27.310
<b>Huh? Why are you asking now?</b>

13:27.700 --> 13:29.550
<b>There's no reason...</b>

13:29.550 --> 13:30.910
<b>I just want to see him.</b>

13:31.690 --> 13:33.820
<b>He's probably nearby.</b>

13:33.820 --> 13:35.660
<b>I'll find him myself.</b>

13:36.340 --> 13:38.660
<b>Once I've killed you!</b>

13:46.670 --> 13:47.340
<b>Sorry!</b>

13:50.450 --> 13:53.820
<b>I panicked and called you an enemy...</b>

13:53.820 --> 13:56.730
<b>But even if you look different, 
you're still Palm, right?</b>

13:59.240 --> 14:00.910
<b>Gon is suffering.</b>

14:01.200 --> 14:03.880
<b>Someone he deeply respects 
was completely transformed.</b>

14:04.450 --> 14:07.390
<b>That person had his soul taken away.</b>

14:07.930 --> 14:11.240
<b>Right now, Gon is facing off 
against the one responsible!</b>

14:12.040 --> 14:15.970
<b>If you appear before Gon 
looking as you do now...</b>

14:21.480 --> 14:22.960
<b>Gon will...</b>

14:24.660 --> 14:26.510
<b>totally snap.</b>

14:33.510 --> 14:35.180
<b>So you have to</b>

14:36.450 --> 14:40.170
<b>call him by his name first.</b>

14:42.630 --> 14:44.290
<b>You must say, "Gon."</b>

14:50.060 --> 14:53.100
<b>That's the condition.</b>

14:56.250 --> 14:57.730
<b>Tell him you're okay.</b>

15:05.010 --> 15:07.620
<b>Before we entered the palace,</b>

15:08.880 --> 15:11.050
<b>Gon was really worried about you.</b>

15:16.310 --> 15:19.930
<b>Give him some peace of mind...</b>

15:24.170 --> 15:25.570
<b>He was just buying time.</b>

15:26.090 --> 15:28.270
<b>He had no intention of letting them meet.</b>

15:28.670 --> 15:30.260
<b>That was the idea...</b>

15:36.940 --> 15:37.990
<b>Help...</b>

15:39.410 --> 15:43.530
<b>make him feel a little better, if you can...</b>

15:44.700 --> 15:49.430
<b>Only you can do that now!</b>

15:54.740 --> 15:57.640
<b>No one else...</b>

15:59.510 --> 16:00.830
<b>can do it.</b>

16:06.140 --> 16:07.270
<b>I can't...</b>

16:09.950 --> 16:12.910
<b>do anything!</b>

16:22.800 --> 16:24.380
<b>Once he'd said those words,</b>

16:25.530 --> 16:29.420
<b>the dam within him burst.</b>

16:44.660 --> 16:45.770
<b>He's completely defenseless.</b>

16:46.480 --> 16:47.930
<b>Change in plans...</b>

16:47.930 --> 16:50.030
<b>Kill him now, #1!</b>

16:57.320 --> 17:01.410
<b>When Palm had infiltrated the palace,</b>

17:01.410 --> 17:05.710
<b>arriving at the exit Knov had 
placed near the stairway,</b>

17:06.100 --> 17:08.100
<b>Pitou's <i>En</i> returned.</b>

17:09.160 --> 17:16.300
<b>Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt 
as though she'd be crushed to dust,</b>

17:16.870 --> 17:19.510
<b>she reached the same conclusion Knov had.</b>

17:21.470 --> 17:28.060
<b>As she watched Pouf slowly and silently 
descend the stairs, she made her decision.</b>

17:29.090 --> 17:30.870
<b>She plotted to take her own life,</b>

17:30.870 --> 17:35.010
<b>so she would look like a despairing girl 
who could not bear Bizeff violating her.</b>

17:37.010 --> 17:40.080
<b>However, Pitou prevented that from happening.</b>

17:41.220 --> 17:46.550
<b>As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,</b>

17:46.550 --> 17:49.470
<b>no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura</b>

17:49.470 --> 17:54.090
<b>to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura 
at the moment she was exposed to it.</b>

17:54.800 --> 17:57.180
<b>The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,</b>

17:57.180 --> 17:59.970
<b>and after receiving permission from the fasting King,</b>

18:00.390 --> 18:06.010
<b>Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.</b>

18:07.440 --> 18:09.850
<b>Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered</b>

18:09.850 --> 18:12.520
<b>their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.</b>

18:13.720 --> 18:19.830
<b>This was most noticeable in Ants who 
had learned how to use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

18:20.210 --> 18:25.690
<b>Memories of the past tended to both assist 
and deter the growth of soldiers.</b>

18:26.630 --> 18:29.550
<b>Deterrence generally happened</b>

18:29.550 --> 18:32.900
<b>when memories led to emotional reactions.</b>

18:33.710 --> 18:39.100
<b>Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded 
that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe</b>

18:39.100 --> 18:43.330
<b>to destroy the connection between 
Palm's memories and her emotions.</b>

18:44.610 --> 18:49.140
<b>The experiments that produced Cheetu 
and Leol confirmed that those</b>

18:49.140 --> 18:53.640
<b>who retained more of their memories 
emerged from their cocoons sooner.</b>

18:55.050 --> 18:59.440
<b>To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,</b>

18:59.440 --> 19:03.680
<b>leaving soldiers with their memories, while 
keeping control of them, would be best.</b>

19:05.020 --> 19:08.330
<b>Palm was the perfect test subject.</b>

19:11.240 --> 19:15.660
<b>The success of her experiment would 
signify the end of the human race.</b>

19:16.590 --> 19:18.470
<b>Now go, #1...</b>

19:19.070 --> 19:21.910
<b>Beat the kid before you to death!</b>

19:21.910 --> 19:23.000
<b>Shut up.</b>

19:28.590 --> 19:29.970
<b>I am</b>

19:31.040 --> 19:32.880
<b>Palm Siberia.</b>

19:37.410 --> 19:39.240
<b>I'm not #1!</b>

19:47.650 --> 19:52.500
<b>I will never become a pawn to you Ants...</b>

19:54.330 --> 19:56.310
<b>Even if it costs my life!</b>

20:18.030 --> 20:19.180
<b>Killua...</b>

20:20.650 --> 20:22.240
<b>I have you to thank.</b>

20:24.710 --> 20:27.350
<b>There was a wall inside my head.</b>

20:28.240 --> 20:30.860
<b>My emotions were separated from my body.</b>

20:31.580 --> 20:33.320
<b>I couldn't do anything about it.</b>

20:34.570 --> 20:37.100
<b>I've been like this since I woke up.</b>

20:38.710 --> 20:41.280
<b>You removed the barrier.</b>

20:42.580 --> 20:45.170
<b>Don't say that there's nothing you can do.</b>

20:50.420 --> 20:55.110
<b>If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.</b>

20:57.080 --> 20:58.660
<b>But you must not forget...</b>

21:00.810 --> 21:05.110
<b>You are the one Gon needs most.</b>

21:23.320 --> 21:24.470
<b>What is it?</b>

21:25.170 --> 21:26.420
<b>Failure.</b>

21:26.950 --> 21:28.570
<b>That's all there is to it.</b>

21:30.870 --> 21:32.710
<b><i>Slow and steady it is.</i></b>

21:33.350 --> 21:37.470
<b><i>Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...</i></b>

21:38.830 --> 21:42.740
<b><i>Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.</i></b>

21:43.760 --> 21:48.240
<b><i>I can create soldiers on my own!</i></b>

21:50.390 --> 21:55.260
<b><i>That will make it easier 
to build a new kingdom</i></b>

21:56.680 --> 21:59.740
<b><i>for the King and me.</i></b>

23:24.730 --> 23:27.620
<b>Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power</b>

23:27.620 --> 23:30.580
<b>Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?</b>

23:30.580 --> 23:33.010
<b>Wait, this is mine.</b>

23:33.010 --> 23:34.590
<b>Oh, well.</b>
