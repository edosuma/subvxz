00:11.968 --> 00:14.275
<i>When a patient goes</i>
<i>into cardiac arrest,</i>

00:14.318 --> 00:17.626
<i>we follow a specific set of</i>
<i>protocols to resuscitate them.</i>

00:19.149 --> 00:22.457
<i>Start with CPR, give oxygen,</i>
<i>assess heart rhythm</i>

00:22.500 --> 00:24.589
<i>to determine if the patient</i>
<i>needs to be shocked.</i>

00:26.461 --> 00:29.420
<i>If needed, push epinephrine</i>
<i>every three to five minutes.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:32.771
<i>Consider an advanced airway</i>

00:32.815 --> 00:36.166
<i>and need to administer</i>
<i>additional medications.</i>

00:38.647 --> 00:41.519
<i>Then check the pulse and start</i>
<i>the cycle all over again.</i>

00:45.654 --> 00:50.180
<i>CPR, shock, meds,</i>
<i>pulse check --</i>

00:50.224 --> 00:52.008
<i>sometimes for hours.</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:53.227
You ready?

00:53.270 --> 00:55.098
Here we go.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.668
<i>Until, hopefully,</i>
<i>you change the course...</i>

01:01.322 --> 01:03.280
<i>...and save a life.</i>

01:05.674 --> 01:06.631
Good morning, everyone.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.981
Good morning.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.636
I know everyone's been following
Fierce Fernanda

01:11.680 --> 01:14.335
as she has traveled across
the country with her family.

01:14.378 --> 01:19.209
I first met Fernanda and
her family in Boston last fall.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.603
She suffers from
congenital aortic valve disease,

01:21.646 --> 01:23.779
which led to aortic stenosis.

01:23.822 --> 01:28.436
At 13 years of age, she's
already had two heart surgeries.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.002
Nothing has worked.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.482
Until today.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.571
We're doing
a Ross procedure.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.269
Only seven programs
in the country

01:35.312 --> 01:36.922
perform Ross procedures,

01:36.966 --> 01:39.490
and you are training
at one of them.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.665
Someone tell me
what it is.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.321
Helm.

01:44.365 --> 01:47.107
Uh, it's taking
a patient's pulmonary valve

01:47.150 --> 01:49.631
and moving it into the position
of their aortic valve,

01:49.674 --> 01:53.330
preventing the need for
lifelong anticoagulant therapy.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.115
Exactly.

01:55.158 --> 01:58.161
It also has the added benefit
for pediatric patients --

01:58.205 --> 02:01.382
since it is their own valve,
it will grow with them.

02:01.425 --> 02:04.385
And on a pediatric patient,
it's even more challenging.

02:04.428 --> 02:07.692
Dr. Pierce is one of only
a few surgeons in the country

02:07.736 --> 02:09.520
who have done this
successfully.

02:09.564 --> 02:12.132
Dr. Ndugu will be working
with me today,

02:12.175 --> 02:14.743
as will one of you.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.529
So, who's ready
to meet Fernanda?

02:20.966 --> 02:23.317
Say hello to
the Grey-Sloan team, Fernanda.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.754
<i>Hi, Dr. Maggie.</i>
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

02:25.797 --> 02:27.538
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.714
Fernanda's condition
left it unsafe

02:29.758 --> 02:31.281
for her to travel
on a commercial plane,

02:31.325 --> 02:33.979
so she and her family
have been driving

02:34.023 --> 02:36.199
all the way across the country
from Boston.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.376
She'll be here
in approximately two hours.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.639
So...

02:41.683 --> 02:43.163
who's ready to scrub --

02:46.949 --> 02:48.646
The spinal fracture
is healing well.

02:48.690 --> 02:49.647
No signs of malalignment.

02:49.691 --> 02:50.692
How's PT going?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.259
My strength's improving.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.608
I'm putting more weight
on the leg every single day.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.392
A lot of progress.
Great!

02:55.436 --> 02:57.786
Okay, I'll want another exam
and set of films in two weeks.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.091
So, I can go back to work?

02:59.135 --> 03:00.267
Today?
No, no.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.964
We're not there yet.
Amelia --

03:02.007 --> 03:03.400
Owen, you're not ready.

03:03.444 --> 03:04.967
You would have to stand
for hours at a time in an OR.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.490
You have to build up
your endurance.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.100
My endurance is fine!

03:10.190 --> 03:12.453
Pick it up
without the crutch.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.497
How scientific.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.630
I'm not clearing you.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.022
There's a physician shortage!

03:17.066 --> 03:19.373
Two weeks!
And keep the pen.

03:29.426 --> 03:32.299
Fierce Fernanda and her family
just made it to Ellensburg.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.301
- Really? Already?
- Yeah.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.041
Let me see.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.176
My throat hurts.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.308
Mine, too.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.918
You're not going
to work, right?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.311
You're worse than me.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.268
Am not.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.840
Hello?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.145
<i>And where the hell are you?</i>

03:53.189 --> 03:54.625
My mom said it's not nice
to say that word.

03:54.669 --> 03:58.760
Okay, then, um, may I talk
to your mom, Miss Zola?

03:58.803 --> 04:00.631
- No, ma'am.
- Excuse me?

04:00.675 --> 04:01.502
No, ma'am.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.155
And my I ask why not?

04:03.199 --> 04:07.029
Because technically,
"no" is a complete sentence.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.597
Can I have the phone?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.468
Bai--
Bailey.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.600
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:12.643 --> 04:14.645
Oh, you sound gross.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.299
I know.
<i>Grey, no.</i>

04:16.343 --> 04:18.301
Uh, y-your name
is on the board

04:18.345 --> 04:21.435
for a Whipple, esophagectomy,
two lap choles.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.437
I know, but...

04:23.480 --> 04:24.742
I was actually
just getting ready to call.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.178
<i>I can, um -- </i>
<i> I can call someone --</i>

04:26.222 --> 04:27.397
Bye!

04:28.746 --> 04:30.008
Richard, oh, thank God.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.488
Grey is sick.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.229
Can you take over some of her --
where are your scrubs?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.318
I'm handing off my assignments.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.320
Until I get
my assessment --No.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
And technically,
that's a complete sentence.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.759
Bailey, I cannot operate
until I've had my assessment.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.195
Says who?
Says me!

04:44.501 --> 04:46.198
Look, I-I just don't trust
myself right now.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.765
Well, <i>I</i> trust you.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.073
T-There's a potential foreign
body in the rectum in bed 9.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.031
You're welcome.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.599
You -- W--
Richard!

04:55.643 --> 04:57.819
You are fine!

04:57.862 --> 05:00.082
Look, you've been doing this
for decades.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.214
We all have good days,
bad days.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.391
Well, I've had more bad
than good lately.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.522
You do know that
we are in the middle

05:05.566 --> 05:07.263
of a physician shortage.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.874
I cannot pick up a scalpel
or supervise anyone

05:09.918 --> 05:12.573
until I know it's safe.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.444
Assessment's next week.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.533
Goodbye.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.708
Chief!
No.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.319
Incoming trauma, two rigs.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
And someone just threw up blood
in trauma two.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.413
I just -- I just -- I just --
I just -- I just -- I...

05:26.456 --> 05:28.763
Okay.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.896
Dr. Pierce!
Thank you.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.115
I've wanted to see
a Ross procedure

05:33.158 --> 05:34.508
- my entire career.
- Hm.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.161
I know the surgery's
extremely difficult.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.816
I mean, the complications
alone -- hemorrhage,

05:38.860 --> 05:41.341
myocardial infarctions, stroke,
obviously death.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.299
Yeah, I think
you've covered it, Helm.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.084
Would you please go see
if her scans are up to date?

05:46.128 --> 05:47.390
Yes.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.087
Dr. Ndugu, Dr. Pierce --

05:49.131 --> 05:50.915
aortic dissection
just came in downstairs.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.309
Patient is
decompensating fast.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.275
Was he DOA?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
What the hell?

06:08.411 --> 06:10.021
I'm alive!

06:12.241 --> 06:14.765
It's too easy.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.637
You jump at everything.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.073
Thanks, Karen.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.423
Yeah. He promised
you wouldn't have me fired.

06:21.685 --> 06:22.947
And who are you?

06:22.991 --> 06:25.602
Uh, uh, Maggie,
this is Wendell.

06:25.646 --> 06:26.647
He's my little brother.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.257
Of course.
I've seen pictures.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.346
Pleasure to
finally meet you.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.885
Grey-Sloan's nice.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.757
Lots of trees,
right in the middle of the city.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.714
You can even see
the Space Needle

06:50.758 --> 06:51.976
from the other side.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.804
When it's not raining.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.458
It's not raining.
Shouldn't it be raining?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.852
It rains a lot in the spring.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.463
Rained the day before
our wedding, actually.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.292
I'm sorry for not making it
to the wedding.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.772
You didn't even RSVP.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.296
I know. I just --

07:07.339 --> 07:08.819
I kept thinking
I'd make it last minute,

07:08.863 --> 07:11.126
but...it --
it was a rough time.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.345
I-I had a job go south,

07:13.389 --> 07:15.043
and I was
a little embarrassed.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.480
I couldn't even afford
a bus ticket to Seattle.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.264
You should've called.

07:19.308 --> 07:22.267
We could've -- We could've
helped or something.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.487
But we're glad
you're here now.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.272
Oh, uh, and I have a job.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.753
You are now looking
at Trinity Labs'

07:29.797 --> 07:31.538
new medical sales
representative.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.322
Bam!
Hm.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.932
With benefits.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.239
Wow.
Congratulations.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.157
Oh. Wendell,
we have a huge case today.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.375
Yeah, uh, go, go.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.247
Go save lives.
Yeah.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.509
Maybe we'll do dinner
later.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.337
Yeah, I'd like that.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.686
Call you
when we're finished.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.515
- You gonna be alright?
- Yeah.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.170
Yeah, I'll just --
I'll keep myself busy.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.127
Alright.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.175
- Okay. Come on.
<i>Dr. Adell to the N.I.C.U.</i>

08:01.524 --> 08:02.743
There. That's good.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.266
Yes, trauma two.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.139
Has it been like this
every day?

08:08.183 --> 08:09.750
Some days it's worse.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.013
We're backed up down here,
we're backed up -- thank you --

08:12.056 --> 08:13.928
on the OR floor.

08:13.971 --> 08:17.714
Trying to find someone to take
Grey's Whipple at noon.

08:17.758 --> 08:22.197
But now even my go-to
locum tenens is avoiding me.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.199
I've got a stack of paperwork
so high,

08:24.242 --> 08:26.157
I can't even
get to my desk.

08:26.201 --> 08:29.204
I know someone
- that could do the Whipple.
- Yes, yes.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.511
Nice try. Shepherd told me
you're not cleared.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.947
I meant <i>you.</i>

08:32.990 --> 08:34.470
Go operate.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.602
Who's supposed to handle
this mess?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.168
Me.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.127
Bailey, half the chief's job
is to be a traffic cop

08:39.170 --> 08:40.345
and to solve problems.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.043
I've done it before,
and I can do it again.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.218
You want to be chief?

08:43.261 --> 08:44.567
W-- Just for the day.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.006
I'll be in the OR...

08:49.050 --> 08:50.268
Chief.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.973
Okay, Laura,
let's try this again.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.366
You do realize
I'm not <i>less</i> pregnant

09:01.410 --> 09:03.673
than the last time we tried
this surgery?
Uh-huh.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.023
Um, Laura Eames, 34,

09:06.067 --> 09:07.590
severe mitral valve
insufficiency

09:07.634 --> 09:09.505
and scheduled for
a transcatheter valve repair.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.376
Again.
You know,
I'm really hoping

09:11.420 --> 09:14.597
this isn't one of those
"rule of three" situations.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.990
Wait, where's, uh,
Dr. Pierce?

09:16.033 --> 09:17.469
Hi, Laura,
I'm Dr. Altman.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.080
I'll be doing
your surgery today.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.299
Dr. Pierce has a big case coming
in from Boston which was --

09:21.343 --> 09:22.953
Yes! The girl in the RV.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.652
I saw her this morning
on "Good Morning Seattle."

09:25.695 --> 09:27.392
Yeah, she's doing
a Ross procedure.
Mm-hmm.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.220
And I'm here.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.661
Wow, that's a lot of fruit.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.053
Yeah, I ordered it online.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.794
Didn't realize
it would be this big. Sorry.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.230
Probably looks bananas.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.624
Hm?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.931
I'm so sorry, uh, again.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.497
It's so sweet.
You didn't have to...

09:45.541 --> 09:47.021
Oh.
...get me...

09:47.064 --> 09:49.197
It's for Laura.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.113
You know I can't eat
before surgery, dummy.

09:52.156 --> 09:56.247
Right.
Uh, then, it <i>is</i> for you?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.380
Thanks.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.732
Alright, the family's
been on the road for weeks,

10:02.776 --> 10:05.866
so anything they need --
um, meals, cots, clothes,

10:05.909 --> 10:07.650
just put an intern on it.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.391
Hospital services has been
in touch with them

10:09.434 --> 10:11.915
about a utilities hookup for
the RV, but we should confirm.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.614
Here they come.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.934
Daniel, what's wrong?

10:30.978 --> 10:32.414
I-I don't know, she suddenly
was starting to feel

10:32.457 --> 10:33.589
a little dizzy.
Come, come, come.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.025
Helm, get a gurney.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.898
Fernanda.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.813
It's Dr. Maggie
and Dr. Ndugu.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.686
I feel...everything spinning.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.296
- When did it start?
- About 20 minutes ago.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.689
I drove
as fast as I could.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.084
We need to get her inside
right away.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.826
Dr. Maggie, are we here?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.218
Did I make it?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.220
Yes, Fernanda,
you made it.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.526
You're in Seattle.
You're at Grey-Sloan.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.659
I made it.
Yes.

10:59.702 --> 11:03.663
I...made...it.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.316
We got to get her to the PICU
right now.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.327
<i>Dr. Martin to Pediatrics.</i> Tell Altman she can have
OR 2.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.417
- She requested OR 1.
- Yeah, because she thinks OR 2
has a buzzing sound,

11:19.461 --> 11:20.592
but it doesn't --
I know this

11:20.636 --> 11:21.942
because nobody else
has ever heard it.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.160
You want me
to tell her that?

11:23.204 --> 11:25.554
I want you to tell her
that she has OR 2.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.382
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.822
Ndugu and Pierce
want to cancel

11:32.866 --> 11:34.389
Hendrick's CABG
this afternoon.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.347
Whoa, whoa, that's gonna throw
our whole schedule off.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.175
Well, they need to run
a few more tests on Fernanda,

11:38.219 --> 11:40.177
and they want to make sure
an OR is open if they need it.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.570
Okay.

11:41.613 --> 11:45.487
FYI, Dr. Lin is in OR 5
with a Z-plasty, not OR 4.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.749
What? Since when?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.925
Since I saw her go in OR 5
with Baldwin.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.362
Does Chief Bailey
know you're doing this?

11:51.406 --> 11:53.669
Yes, I'm acting chief
today.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.366
Oh.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.369
You know, I was chief of surgery
for five years.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.763
Huh.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.071
You're chief of surgery?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.550
Uh, yes,
at least for the day.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.856
I was told
to speak with you.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.031
Wendell Ndugu.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.424
Oh, any relation to...

12:09.467 --> 12:11.165
Winston is my brother.
Ah.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.645
I have an amazing opportunity
for you.

12:13.689 --> 12:16.866
Okay, we're trying to get
her blood pressure back up,

12:16.910 --> 12:19.695
but she is
extremely dehydrated.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.001
We're giving her fluids,
but we noticed

12:21.044 --> 12:22.393
that her murmur's
much worse.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.527
What...about...
my surgery?

12:25.570 --> 12:26.571
Can you still do it?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.138
Uh, we're not sure.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.619
We'll have to run an echo,
do a cardiac MRI --

12:30.662 --> 12:33.143
Her dehydration,
is that because of the trip?

12:33.187 --> 12:35.450
Possibly, but we knew
it would be tricky

12:35.493 --> 12:36.799
getting Fernanda here.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.366
We should've
gotten here sooner.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.497
We never should've stopped.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.934
He made us stop and --
and sight-see --

12:40.977 --> 12:42.892
I thought we had time.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.372
Fernanda's numbers
were good.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.416
She was feeling great.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.983
We've been in and out
of hospitals,

12:47.027 --> 12:49.029
so I just wanted the kids
to see the country,

12:49.072 --> 12:50.682
have some normalcy
before the surgery.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.076
I...didn't think
it would hurt

12:53.120 --> 12:54.861
to stop for
a few...pictures.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
- Dad?
- Mr. Lima, are you okay?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.516
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just a little back pain.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.823
I've been driving this RV
for two weeks.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.608
We'll have someone
take a look at it.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
In the meantime...

13:05.828 --> 13:08.309
this isn't
anyone's fault, okay?

13:08.352 --> 13:11.834
So let us just do the scans,
and we'll go from there.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.967
Alright?
Hang tight, Fernanda.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.755
Are you okay?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.539
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:23.628
<i>Dr. Wagner to Radiology.</i>

13:25.500 --> 13:27.328
Free fruit!

13:28.851 --> 13:30.766
Ugh.
We're gonna be in OR 2.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.247
Okay, I think I'm gonna try
and cram in

13:33.290 --> 13:34.857
another practice test
until then.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.554
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.470
Hi, uh --Hi.

13:39.514 --> 13:43.126
Oh.
Oh, yeah,
I-I was just sharing.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.606
Who doesn't like fruit?

13:44.649 --> 13:47.174
I don't know.
Uh, serial killers? Cats?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.045
Um...

13:49.089 --> 13:51.918
do you want
to grab dinner tonight?

13:51.961 --> 13:53.702
Keep up the tradition
of hanging out

13:53.745 --> 13:55.704
when my sister's
in the hospital?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.532
I would. Um, yeah.
Okay.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.055
But I-I have to study

13:59.099 --> 14:01.014
for my annual
OB resident's exam,

14:01.057 --> 14:03.146
so I will be holed up
in a library.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.409
Okay, well, I don't
get in the way of a library.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.674
Uh, uh, also, Laura was asking
for some ice chips.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.894
Oh, yeah, um, okay.
Oh, hey.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.330
Do you -- Would you mind
grabbing ice chips

14:13.374 --> 14:14.723
for this patient here?

14:14.766 --> 14:15.855
Thank you.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.901
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.776
Okay, I know that
it's probably not --

14:24.820 --> 14:27.344
he -- he's not technically
a -- a patient, so I --

14:27.388 --> 14:29.129
Oh, relax, Wilson.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.522
I married a patient once.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.915
For insurance.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.352
- So I'm not judging.
- Okay.

14:35.396 --> 14:39.922
Um, and just for the record,
the thing with Link is over.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.402
What thing with Link?

14:41.445 --> 14:42.925
Remember how
I slept with Link?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.318
You slept with Link?!

14:44.361 --> 14:46.450
Oh, my God, be quiet!

14:46.494 --> 14:49.366
Yes, remember how I told you
at the bar?

14:50.759 --> 14:52.935
I barely remember the bar.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
Are you -- Are...

14:55.546 --> 14:56.634
I have to go.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.290
W-- Did I -- Did I tell you
anything at the bar?

15:06.601 --> 15:08.690
Oh, God! Oh, God!

15:12.085 --> 15:13.521
Oh, excuse me,
can you direct me

15:13.564 --> 15:15.001
to the residency director's
office?

15:15.044 --> 15:17.394
Oh, uh, Dr. Webber
isn't in today.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.830
Uh, try Chief Bailey.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.010
The pain
could be positional

15:24.053 --> 15:25.620
from driving
so many hours a day,

15:25.663 --> 15:28.231
but I'm happy to do
an exam, order scans?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.364
Okay. He may be downplaying
his level of pain

15:30.407 --> 15:31.669
because he doesn't want
to take attention away

15:31.713 --> 15:34.368
from Fernanda's care...Mm-hmm.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.630
Oh, no.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.979
Winston, come listen.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.676
And it's not
without precedent.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.853
In Europe, a pilot program
with a similar BioTech Drone

15:41.897 --> 15:44.639
succeeded in saving a patient
11 out of 12 takeoffs.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.337
So you're saying we can send
a drone ahead of an ambulance

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
carrying a defibrillator?

15:49.035 --> 15:51.254
A defibrillator in a drone,
for now.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.300
In about four to six months,
we're talking about other

15:53.343 --> 15:55.955
portable emergency equipment --
powered AI rovers.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.869
I mean, the lives
we can save.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.741
You know,
this all sounds pretty amazing.

15:59.784 --> 16:02.700
I will definitely kick this up
to the board.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.659
Your brother's selling
some pretty high tech.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.487
Very futuristic
and cool.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.619
Wow. I --
I had no idea.

16:08.663 --> 16:09.794
This is your brother?

16:09.838 --> 16:11.231
Yeah.
Hold on.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.710
Dr. Shepherd?

16:12.754 --> 16:14.408
- Dr. Amelia Shepherd?
- Yeah.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.713
I've read about your work

16:15.757 --> 16:17.280
on ultrasound-guided
tumor reduction.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.282
I didn't know I was meeting
a celebrity.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.719
Wendell Ndugu, former
black sheep of the family.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.721
Ah, from one former black sheep
to another,

16:23.765 --> 16:25.419
it's very nice to meet you.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.811
How long are you in town?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.291
Uh, you should come
for dinner.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.727
You know what?
I'd love that.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.294
Wendell, uh, you mind
if I talk to you real quick

16:31.338 --> 16:32.513
before I head up
to radiology?

16:32.556 --> 16:33.731
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

16:33.775 --> 16:34.732
Nice talking to you,
Dr. Hunt.

16:34.776 --> 16:35.951
- Thank you.
- Dr. Shepherd.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.909
Yeah.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.433
- Right in here.
- Yeah.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.697
Why are you wearing scrubs?

16:44.220 --> 16:46.266
What are you doing?

16:46.309 --> 16:47.702
I'm just doing my job.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.269
Wendell,
you don't work here.

16:49.312 --> 16:53.012
Where do you think
medical sales happen?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.404
In a hospital.
And, you know,
I just wish you would've

16:54.448 --> 16:55.927
talked to me about it first,
man.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.581
I don't even know
what you're selling.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.800
These people
are my colleagues.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.281
Some of these people
are my bosses.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.934
Exactly.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.197
How do you think
I got the job?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.374
You used my name
to get the job?

17:09.637 --> 17:12.205
I mean, I had to at least
mention that my brother's

17:12.248 --> 17:14.642
a hotshot surgeon
at Grey-Sloan...Mm.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.339
...and that my sister-in-law
is head of cardio,

17:16.383 --> 17:17.906
and that I know
Dr. Richard Webber.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.168
You don't know
Richard Webber!

17:19.212 --> 17:20.909
Well, I mean, I could
if you would introduce me.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.780
Wendell, come on, man,
you lied!

17:26.132 --> 17:28.656
You know, Dad told me
not to come here.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.267
Dad told you not to --
you're still talking to Dad?

17:31.311 --> 17:33.878
He said you wouldn't help me,
said you wouldn't get it.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.185
Okay.
You know what I said?

17:36.229 --> 17:38.840
I said, "No, no, no, no.
It'll be different this time."

17:38.883 --> 17:42.670
Because I finally have a job
that you could be happy about.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
A type of job you've been
telling me to get for years.

17:46.717 --> 17:47.892
I said you would be proud.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.374
I guess Dad was right.

18:02.951 --> 18:06.259
<i>The giant panda,</i>
<i>also known as the panda bear,</i>

18:06.302 --> 18:09.131

18:09.175 --> 18:12.787

18:31.371 --> 18:32.850
It is when I'm with you.

18:35.244 --> 18:40.162
Is it weird that I wish
we got sick together more?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.730
Yes, but I was just thinking
the same thing.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.645
<i>...to mark their scent.</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:49.998
That Whipple was perfection.
Textbook.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.044
And it brought me joy, Perez.
Do you see my joy?

18:53.088 --> 18:54.698
I see it.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.265
Your closure
was almost jaunty.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.875
- Happy for you, Chief.
- Yes, I'm looking
for the Chief.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.094
- She's right here.
- Is the esophagectomy next?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.095
Uh, I think so.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.488
Oh, hi, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.142
I'm looking for
Chief Miranda Bailey?

19:03.185 --> 19:04.317
Oh, not today, ma'am.
Sorry.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.666
Excuse me?

19:05.709 --> 19:06.710
If you're looking for
the chief today,

19:06.754 --> 19:08.321
please see Dr. Owen Hunt.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.018
He'll help you
with whatever you need.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.281
Uh, If you'll excuse me,
I have a surgery.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.676
Joy.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.331
<i>Dr. Yoon to OR 1.</i>
<i>Dr. Yoon to OR 1.</i>

19:18.374 --> 19:21.160
Alright.
Where do I find Dr. Hunt?

19:24.075 --> 19:26.208
We'll see you upstairs,
okay?

19:30.343 --> 19:31.779
Fernanda's aortic stenosis

19:31.822 --> 19:33.476
has gone from severe
to critical.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.132
Made worse
by the dehydration.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.918
Wow. Aortic jet velocity's
through the roof.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.398
What are you thinking?

19:42.442 --> 19:45.009
Damn it. The ventricle
is too small.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.534
Seems to be a narrowing
of the LVOT.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.057
Risky just became riskier.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.364
I don't even think I can fit
a pulmonary valve in there.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.887
Maybe they should have spent
less time taking pictures.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.890
They could have
gotten Fernanda here

19:55.933 --> 19:58.588
in less than four days,
and instead,

19:58.632 --> 20:00.590
they took
crowdfunding money

20:00.634 --> 20:02.766
from strangers and blew it
on a sight-seeing tour.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.942
They wanted to spend time
together as a family.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.248
Well, that extra time

20:06.292 --> 20:07.597
just caused Fernanda
to become sicker,

20:07.641 --> 20:08.903
which means
we're walking into

20:08.946 --> 20:11.035
an impossible situation
in the OR.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.603
So it's selfish.
Her family was selfish.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.258
Are you okay?

20:17.607 --> 20:19.305
Fine.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.611
Look, if it were up to me,
I would change course

20:21.655 --> 20:23.004
at this juncture.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.397
You want to cancel
the Ross procedure?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.007
Yeah, I do.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.400
Is this
your medical opinion,

20:27.443 --> 20:29.010
or are you looking
to punish this family

20:29.053 --> 20:31.882
for what you consider to be
their "selfishness?"

20:31.926 --> 20:33.536
Winston, I know
that you're having problems

20:33.580 --> 20:34.581
with your brother
right now --Look, my opinion is based

20:34.624 --> 20:36.365
on the scans, Maggie.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.327
But I'll support
whatever you decide.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.692
What? You can't put a five
on a king.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.520
- What is wrong with you?
- Wait, no, you said
fives are magic.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.912
No, I said
they're <i>half</i> magic.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.392
We've been playing this game
for 10 years.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.959
How do you still not know
the rules?

21:05.002 --> 21:05.916
Dr. Wilson.Yeah.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.222
Will you please tell
my brother

21:07.266 --> 21:09.442
that you can put a five
on a king?

21:09.485 --> 21:13.184
Well, uh, she is getting
heart surgery today,

21:13.228 --> 21:15.143
so she can do whatever
she wants.
Mm.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.014
I knew you two would gang up
on me eventually.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.538
Mm-hmm.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.757
Uh-oh.
Here for me?

21:20.801 --> 21:22.498
No, I thought I'd get
a quick appendix removed

21:22.542 --> 21:23.586
while we wait.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.763
You're going to be fine.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.199
Yeah, that's what
you said last time.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.853
And you were fine.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.553
My uterus compressed my IVC
and my heart stopped.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.251
And you woke up.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.644
And you were okay.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.428
And your baby was fine.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.519
Okay, look.

21:43.563 --> 21:46.696
Okay, so I'm -- I'm studying
for this test right now.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.396
My entire OB-GYN residency
rides on it.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.223
So basically all I do

21:52.267 --> 21:55.444
is deliver babies,
examine vaginas,

21:55.488 --> 21:58.621
and read about delivering babies
and examining vaginas.

21:58.665 --> 22:02.930
So if there is one person
on the planet right now

22:02.973 --> 22:06.716
who's prepared to help you,
it's me.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.588
And, look, now you know

22:08.631 --> 22:11.373
we have your baby's health
as our first priority,

22:11.417 --> 22:14.420
so if anything doesn't
look right, we will stop,

22:14.463 --> 22:16.596
just like we did before.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.424
You're gonna be okay,
Laura.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.425
Thank you.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.426
You ready?

22:20.469 --> 22:22.123
You got this.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.124
Love you.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.299
Love you.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.392
Alright, let's head out.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.706
You want to try a different kind
of surgery? Today?

22:39.749 --> 22:41.403
It's called
a Ross-Konno procedure.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.013
It's still
the Ross procedure,

22:43.057 --> 22:44.450
but we need to make sure
that Fernanda's ventricle

22:44.493 --> 22:45.842
can handle it,

22:45.886 --> 22:46.930
so we need to enlarge it
first.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.410
And how do you do that?

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
We cut it in half.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.415
You want to cut
our daughter's heart in half?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.808
Dividing
part of the ventricle

22:54.851 --> 22:56.113
allows for better flow
to the heart,

22:56.157 --> 22:58.115
which will ensure
that the Ross procedure

22:58.159 --> 23:00.074
actually corrects
Fernanda's stenosis.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.380
Is it riskier?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.294
Yes.

23:03.338 --> 23:07.864
We have to cut around the fibers
that control her heart beat.

23:07.908 --> 23:11.390
She could go
into complete heart block.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.784
Oh, my God. <i>Meu Deus do céu...</i>

23:14.828 --> 23:16.786
Have you or Dr. Winston
done this procedure

23:16.830 --> 23:19.572
on someone as sick
- as Fernanda?
- We haven't.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.966
But you've come of all this way
because you trusted me.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.404
So I need you
to keep trusting me.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.624
This is Fernanda's
best shot.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.322
So how do you know
you can even do it?

23:35.457 --> 23:37.372
Mom...

23:37.416 --> 23:39.896
everyone else
said no.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.812
Everyone except
Dr. Maggie.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.427
Is it the best option
to replace her valve?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.037
It is.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.386
But we need to go now.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.219
Do the surgery,
Dr. Maggie.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.489
Hey, Rafael.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.577
Everything okay?

24:08.621 --> 24:13.060
Just...a little dizzy...

24:13.103 --> 24:15.454
It hurts to breathe...

24:15.497 --> 24:18.152
Okay, alright.
Um, here.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.283
C-Come with me. Come on.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.590
Right in here.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.507
Take a seat.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.384
Okay, deep breaths, okay?

24:33.428 --> 24:35.474
Inhale...

24:35.517 --> 24:38.651
hold, three, two, one...

24:38.694 --> 24:40.479
exhale.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.350
Good.
Again, like that.

24:46.267 --> 24:49.052
Panic attacks are sometimes
the body's reaction

24:49.096 --> 24:52.012
to fear or stress.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.622
You're worried
about Fernanda, right?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.496
Rafael?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.106
I'm a horrible brother.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.151
Hey, come on,
what are you talking about?

25:01.195 --> 25:03.066
You came all the way here
with her.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.373
I'm a left winger, y'know?

25:05.416 --> 25:07.418
Fastest in school.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.596
I can dribble past anyone,
any age, any size.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.120
Like Neymar.

25:13.163 --> 25:17.080
Yeah, except...

25:17.124 --> 25:20.997
I lost my soccer scholarship
because I had to leave school.

25:21.041 --> 25:23.522
My sister's heart
isn't just killing her.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.959
It's killing all of us.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.569
My dad may have just
fractured his back,

25:27.613 --> 25:29.789
my mom hasn't slept
in days...

25:29.832 --> 25:30.833
No one can breathe.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.401
None of us can breathe.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.576
We took a week.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.622
We took some pictures.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.493
We laughed,
and we ate stupid tourist food,

25:38.537 --> 25:42.105
and we saw the Badlands,
and we were happy for a minute.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.586
And now that might've killed
my sister.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.545
Now they have to cut
her heart in half.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.938
'Cause we took
a few extra days!

25:48.982 --> 25:50.810
It feels like
we're getting punished.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.725
Like,
I don't know what we did wrong.

25:52.768 --> 25:55.858
But we just keep
getting punished.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.775
If my sister dies because
we stopped at the Badlands...

25:59.819 --> 26:01.690
we won't ever recover.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.866
We won't make it.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.825
We won't make it.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.349
We won't make it.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.628
What -- What do you think
you're all doing?

26:26.672 --> 26:28.543
I could ask you
the same thing.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.372
- Dr. Pierce is about to
- start Fierce Fernanda's surgery.
- Uh-huh.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.635
We heard a rumor that she's now
doing a Ross-Konno procedure.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.332
And we snagged front row.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.248
Uh, for the learning
opportunity.
Hm, okay.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.642
Tseng, you're supposed to be
covering the ICU,

26:40.686 --> 26:42.818
and I have not received
your monthly case report.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.428
Perez, you're assigned
to general,

26:44.472 --> 26:46.039
which means you should be
in OR 3

26:46.082 --> 26:47.823
assisting Ruiz
with a colectomy.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.738
Dr. Hunt, this is
a once-in-a-career surgery --

26:49.782 --> 26:51.653
How many times does Dr. Bailey
need to remind you

26:51.697 --> 26:53.612
there is
a physician shortage?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.265
All of you, up.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.877
Go <i>do</i> medicine
instead of watching it.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.443
Now!

27:02.055 --> 27:04.927
What?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.276
I'm still
not clearing you.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.277
Dr. Hunt?

27:07.321 --> 27:08.496
Yeah, how can
I help you?

27:08.539 --> 27:10.193
You're a hard person
to track down.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.370
MaryAnn Suchan, from the
Medical Accreditation Council.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.937
We need to talk.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.591
Yeah.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.901
Must be really
nerve-wracking,

27:21.944 --> 27:24.425
doing this kind of surgery
with so many eyes watching.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.166
I mean, the entire country's
pulling for this little girl,

27:26.209 --> 27:28.124
and you just made
a rare procedure

27:28.168 --> 27:29.822
into an even rarer one.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.127
Helm, are you finished
scrubbing?

27:31.171 --> 27:32.433
I am.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.702
Are you --

27:40.746 --> 27:43.052
Please pick
a different question.

27:43.096 --> 27:48.275
Are you aware that
your entire body is tense?

27:48.318 --> 27:50.538
Even your jaw is locked.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.716
I was wrong.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.327
I was wrong to tell you
to call this off.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.504
This surgery is mildly
terrifying,

28:00.548 --> 28:04.726
but...I can do it.

28:04.770 --> 28:08.338
Even so, I need someone in there
who can assist me.

28:08.382 --> 28:12.516
And I need that person to be
completely focused.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.390
So I'm asking you, Winston,
do I need to page Altman?

28:16.433 --> 28:17.783
Whatever's going on
with your brother --

28:17.826 --> 28:21.264
When my mom had cancer,
Wendell and my dad,

28:21.308 --> 28:24.398
they flipped out
on the outside.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.575
Wendell would get into fights
with anyone who crossed him.

28:27.618 --> 28:33.407
And my dad drank
and just threw away money.

28:33.450 --> 28:36.018
And he landed in jail
a few times.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.456
And even after everything
he put us through

28:39.500 --> 28:40.414
over the years,

28:40.457 --> 28:42.329
Mom forgave him.

28:43.547 --> 28:47.638
And she would use her money
for her treatment

28:47.682 --> 28:49.858
to bail him out.

28:49.902 --> 28:53.427
And because Mom had cancer,
I was also freaking out.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.951
Just on the inside.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.474
And they didn't help.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.259
They just made it worse.

28:59.302 --> 29:04.438
And I started --
started having panic attacks,

29:04.481 --> 29:07.615
and I almost had to quit
my fellowship.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.661
My whole life almost derailed
because of them.

29:13.099 --> 29:17.320
And now I have
this amazing thing here...

29:18.495 --> 29:23.065
...and I think
I got scared

29:23.109 --> 29:26.460
that Wendell's
somehow...

29:26.503 --> 29:28.070
just gonna do it
all over again.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.814
But I'm not gonna let him.

29:32.858 --> 29:37.471
Because my wife
is a genius.

29:37.514 --> 29:38.951
And we have a life
to save.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.956
Hell, we have a whole family
to save.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.288
Ready to deploy the clip.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.550
How's her pressure?

30:13.594 --> 30:15.117
Steady.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.597
And you're sure
about the valve size?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.860
- A 3
- D-CTA was performed.
We're a match.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.514
And you have
a proper alignment?

30:20.557 --> 30:22.777
Is there a problem with
the fetal monitor, Dr. Wilson?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.301
- Nope.
- Well, and I trust you
when you tell me that,

30:25.345 --> 30:26.781
so trust me when I tell you

30:26.825 --> 30:29.175
that everything
is okay up here.
Sorry.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.568
I just have all these
study questions in my head,

30:31.612 --> 30:33.875
so I'm going over
every worst case scenario.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.659
Happens.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.923
Nothing to do with the fact
that fruit-boy's sister

30:37.966 --> 30:39.359
is on the table?

30:39.402 --> 30:41.448
Can I ask a question?

30:41.491 --> 30:43.232
How long do we think
this procedure will take?

30:43.276 --> 30:44.712
Why?

30:44.755 --> 30:46.627
Well, Dr. Pierce upgraded
Fernanda's surgery

30:46.670 --> 30:48.063
to a Ross-Konno.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.238
So I thought maybe
I could head over --

30:49.282 --> 30:51.327
No, you can't
ask a question.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.679
As you can see,
it's not an isolated incident.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.464
We've received
over 15 complaints

30:57.507 --> 30:58.857
about Grey-Sloan's
residency program

30:58.900 --> 31:00.554
in the last six months.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.469
From the actual residents?

31:02.512 --> 31:04.514
It's anonymous,
so it could be anyone.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.821
But the complaints include
working over 80 hours a week,

31:06.865 --> 31:09.998
being asked to perform surgeries
without supervision,

31:10.042 --> 31:14.002
participating in a program with
a glaring lack of teachers...

31:14.046 --> 31:15.961
And, Dr. Hunt,
I witnessed you yelling

31:16.004 --> 31:17.876
at a group
of residents today.

31:17.919 --> 31:21.357
Oh, um, uh, we've been
short-staffed recently --

31:21.401 --> 31:23.446
So you kicked students out
of an incredible experience

31:23.490 --> 31:25.796
to observe a surgery
that's never been done before?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.233
I apologize for that,
but --

31:27.276 --> 31:31.063
Apologies don't fix
a systemic problem, Dr. Hunt.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.065
But why am I speaking to you
about all of this

31:33.108 --> 31:35.241
and not Dr. Webber
or Chief Bailey?

31:49.211 --> 31:50.952
Scalpel.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.526
They were right to travel
across the country for you.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.528
But I already knew that.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.530
I did it, too.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.967
Okay.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.882
Here we go.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.320
Honey.

33:44.718 --> 33:45.980
Hey.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.503
Is Laura okay?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.157
Dr. Altman said that
everything was -- was --

33:49.201 --> 33:50.202
Oh, yeah, no,
Laura's great.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.420
Oh.
She's annoyed at me,

33:51.464 --> 33:54.771
which means
that she's doing just fine.

33:54.815 --> 33:55.990
Thank you, by the way.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.078
I really didn't want to
have to tell her

33:57.122 --> 33:58.166
that you were wrong.
Mm.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.689
You know,
about her being okay.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.169
Yeah.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.824
I got to say, if you talk
to all your patients

34:03.867 --> 34:05.478
the way you spoke
to my sister,

34:05.521 --> 34:08.263
you are going to pass this test
with flying colors.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.439
Yeah, there's just
a little bit more to it

34:10.483 --> 34:11.658
than bedside manner.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.094
- Oh, is there?
- Mm-hmm.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.487
You don't just put your arms out
and catch the babies?

34:14.530 --> 34:16.445
No.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.620
I don't want to presume...

34:17.664 --> 34:18.665
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.015
Uh, these <i>are</i> for you.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.669
And I-I didn't know
what you liked,

34:22.712 --> 34:25.846
so the gift shop lady told me
to go with roses, to be safe.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.804
So...here.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.371
They're perfect.
Thank you.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.286
And...

34:31.330 --> 34:32.505
Study snacks.

34:32.548 --> 34:33.680
What?
Yes, yes.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.248
I got you water...Uh-huh.

34:36.291 --> 34:39.903
...electrolytes, chips...Obviously.

34:39.947 --> 34:42.123
...dark chocolate, and I wanted
to put some fruit in,

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
but I thought
I over-fruited earlier.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.779
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

34:45.822 --> 34:48.825
Well, nobody has ever bought me
study snacks before.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.785
Yeah, and I've never kissed
a girl in a library before.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.875
But...the same reason

34:54.918 --> 34:57.225
that kept me from doing it
in the past

34:57.269 --> 35:00.272
is keeping me
from doing it now.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.360
And what's that?

35:03.536 --> 35:06.887
People
come to libraries to study.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.106
That's right.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.324
Mm.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.283
Good luck
on your test, Jo.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.329
Good night, Todd.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.473
Coming off bypass.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.735
Moment of truth.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.432
Come on, Fernanda.

35:30.476 --> 35:31.868
Come on.

35:38.788 --> 35:39.876
Still nothing.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.846
Welcome back,
Fierce Fernanda.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.692
It worked?

36:12.735 --> 36:14.172
It worked.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.217
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

36:16.261 --> 36:18.437
Oh!

36:20.830 --> 36:22.180
Oh.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.268
Come on. Come on.

36:24.617 --> 36:25.574
- Thank you.
- Oh!

36:25.618 --> 36:28.186
Thank you.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.666
Sorry.
Brazilians are huggers.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.755
It's okay.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.453
No, she's got
a long road to recovery,

36:34.496 --> 36:36.977
but so far, so good.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.022
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Maggie.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.328
Thank you.
Thank you for saying yes.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.549
Oh!

36:45.768 --> 36:48.162
Mm.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.920
Um...

37:06.963 --> 37:08.617
you have
your worried face on.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.358
No, I don't.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.883
Zola, it's me.

37:13.927 --> 37:16.016
You keep ignoring
Dr. Hamilton's phone calls,

37:16.059 --> 37:18.279
and you won't text
Dr. Marsh back.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.761
Do you want the truth?

37:23.110 --> 37:25.330
They want to talk to me
about something

37:25.373 --> 37:28.028
that I probably should talk
to you about first.

37:28.071 --> 37:29.551
What is it?

37:29.595 --> 37:32.119
I've been offered a job
in Minnesota.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.164
You already have a job
in Minnesota.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.775
Right. But this job
would require me

37:35.818 --> 37:38.778
to give up
my job in Seattle.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.781
So we would move?

37:41.824 --> 37:45.219
We would have to, yes.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.526
How w-- How would you feel
about that?

37:47.569 --> 37:49.310
Would the job save
a lot of lives?

37:49.354 --> 37:50.964
Maybe.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.748
Would you see
Dr. Marsh more?

37:54.446 --> 37:56.012
Probably.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.058
Would that
make you happy?

37:58.101 --> 38:01.061
You, Bailey, and Ellis
make me happy.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.150
We would follow you
anywhere.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.240
<i>Researchers studied</i>
<i>patient codes</i>

38:06.284 --> 38:08.155
<i>at hundreds of hospitals.</i>

38:08.198 --> 38:10.549
<i>They found patients</i>
<i>had increased survival rates</i>

38:10.592 --> 38:14.553
<i>at hospitals with longer</i>
<i>attempts at resuscitation.</i>

38:14.596 --> 38:17.643
<i>Of course, there are limits</i>
<i>on how much we can do.</i>

38:17.686 --> 38:19.862
Thanks for coming back.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.778
Yeah. I'm surprised
you called.

38:24.563 --> 38:26.347
I still blame you
for Mom dying.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.744
I didn't
give Mom cancer.

38:31.787 --> 38:34.007
I know.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.791
But sometimes...

38:35.835 --> 38:39.229
I think that
she would still be alive

38:39.273 --> 38:42.798
if she didn't put all
of her money and energy

38:42.842 --> 38:45.497
into you and Dad.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.630
I know --
I know that's not fair.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.197
Look, her cancer...

38:51.633 --> 38:53.200
...it took us out.

38:54.767 --> 38:58.161
It took us both out
in different ways, man.

38:58.205 --> 39:03.993
And she would be so angry
if she knew...

39:08.302 --> 39:12.088
...if she knew that we let it
take us away from each other.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.048
I miss you, man.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.138
I'm glad you're here.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.577
And...if you want
to stick around,

39:22.621 --> 39:25.711
Maggie said
you can stay with us,

39:25.754 --> 39:28.061
and I will try
to introduce you

39:28.104 --> 39:30.977
to some people
at the hospital, alright?

39:31.020 --> 39:32.761
It'll be different
this time.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.415
I hope so.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.287
Should we hug it out?

39:37.331 --> 39:38.245
No.
No?

39:38.288 --> 39:39.289
We should get some food.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.553
Come on. Some beer.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.816
Maggie's waiting for us.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.166
Uh, can you cover me
for dinner?

39:46.209 --> 39:48.298
I'm kidding.
Wow, look at that face.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.605
It's on me, actually.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.477
Uh, you know,
company card.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.653
It's on you?
Yeah, exactly.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.438
<i>As hard as we try, not every</i>
<i>patient has a happy ending.</i>

40:00.223 --> 40:03.226
One day in that chair,
and you look 10 years older.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.838
See? That's why
I needed today.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.666
So thank you.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.799
I did that Whipple, a fundo,
two endoscopies.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.584
I even squeezed in
an ex-lap

40:12.627 --> 40:15.151
that came from that horrible
pile-up on the bridge.

40:15.195 --> 40:16.631
I haven't done that much surgery
in one day

40:16.675 --> 40:18.024
since I was a resident.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.373
Uh.
Bailey.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.244
Ah, I feel centered now.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.159
This is manageable now.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.160
Bailey.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.511
What?

40:26.554 --> 40:28.469
What is it?

40:28.513 --> 40:30.776
Our residency program...

40:30.819 --> 40:34.823
this is an official
notification.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.738
They're trying
to shut it down.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.264
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>we just have to call it.</i>
