04:55.126 --> 04:57.834
Come, come.

05:23.959 --> 05:26.667
Give me work!

05:31.876 --> 05:35.959
All right. You want work?

05:37.042 --> 05:39.709
Go make a ladder out of bread.

05:46.917 --> 05:50.084
What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

05:50.334 --> 05:52.209
Might be because of the rain.

05:52.459 --> 05:56.542
God damn it! I used my best tools on him.

06:47.126 --> 06:51.292
It's so beautiful.
Like the Christmas tree in church.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.792
I like slaughtering pigs more.

07:03.042 --> 07:07.667
Based on
Andrus Kivirähk's novel "Rehepapp".

07:32.834 --> 07:36.501
Get up! It's All Souls' Day.

07:36.751 --> 07:39.292
Go heat the sauna.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.876
And you set the table.

07:44.917 --> 07:48.626
Let them eat and bathe, the poor beasts.

07:51.251 --> 07:53.251
They're not beasts!

07:54.834 --> 07:58.459
They're mother and grandfather.
How can you say that?

07:59.501 --> 08:04.584
No need to mince words about it.
The dead can't afford to be picky.

08:06.001 --> 08:11.126
They're no longer people.
So why not call them beasts?

08:24.376 --> 08:27.001
When my grandmother was little,

08:27.251 --> 08:33.417
she snuck into the sauna to see
what the dead were doing in there.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.917
She opened the door, and what did she see?

08:38.167 --> 08:42.417
Human-sized chickens
thrashing themselves with birch twigs.

08:43.458 --> 08:46.792
Isn't a chicken an animal?

09:02.834 --> 09:05.417
Are you trying to heat the village?

11:18.709 --> 11:21.834
What did you bring for me?

11:22.084 --> 11:26.501
Hold on. You'll see.

11:37.251 --> 11:39.542
How pretty!

11:44.834 --> 11:47.459
My God! It's so fancy!

11:47.709 --> 11:51.834
Not bad, eh?
- Where did you get it?

11:53.376 --> 11:57.417
From the old baroness. It's her last one.

12:01.751 --> 12:04.751
I went through all her trunks,

12:05.001 --> 12:09.209
but she has nothing left to take.
It's all mine.

12:10.876 --> 12:13.876
I feel bad for the old lady.

12:15.251 --> 12:19.292
She's bedridden and
doesn't even have a nightgown to wear.

12:21.209 --> 12:25.001
Once I felt so bad for her
that I gave her one of mine.

12:25.251 --> 12:30.126
Yours? Aren't your nightgowns really hers?

12:33.001 --> 12:35.084
What's in the past doesn't matter.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.209
What do you want for it?

12:44.167 --> 12:47.834
It's a very expensive, nice dress.

13:00.584 --> 13:06.834
What happened to your silver brooch?
I'd give up the dress for that.

13:09.626 --> 13:14.792
For this, all you get is a strip of silk.

14:08.251 --> 14:12.334
She's all tarted up. It's disgusting.

14:12.584 --> 14:14.667
I don't know. She looks beautiful.

14:14.917 --> 14:20.626
You try cooking that beauty in a pot
and see if it fills your belly.

16:59.417 --> 17:05.416
I saw... your mother by that willow tree.

17:15.126 --> 17:19.126
How did you know
I was looking for my mother?

17:19.376 --> 17:22.001
I'm also waiting.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.209
My mother is buried here too.

17:39.751 --> 17:43.459
The Rääk dead are here.

17:43.709 --> 17:47.959
Welcome. Let's go home.

17:55.959 --> 17:58.001
Come on.

18:09.292 --> 18:12.001
Are you coming? Let's go!

18:19.626 --> 18:24.376
Wasn't that Liina?

18:26.251 --> 18:27.334
Yes.

18:27.584 --> 18:32.584
She's grown into a beautiful woman.
- Yeah.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.376
The sauna is ready.

18:52.584 --> 18:56.917
As always, you'll take the bed,

18:57.626 --> 18:59.042
and we'll sleep on the floor.

18:59.292 --> 19:05.667
I'm not worried about my hidden treasure.

19:10.334 --> 19:14.084
But I brought some trinkets home.

19:16.084 --> 19:17.334
Where are they?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.167
Liina?

19:48.084 --> 19:52.709
Where is it? Where's the ring?

20:02.334 --> 20:03.292
It's gone!

20:14.126 --> 20:17.334
So that's why the kratt
was snooping around!

20:17.584 --> 20:22.001
Why didn't you tell me? When was it?

20:23.126 --> 20:24.959
The day before yesterday!

20:25.209 --> 20:30.709
I came from the well with buckets,
and I saw a kratt scurry out of the back.

20:30.959 --> 20:32.876
What did it look like?

20:33.126 --> 20:36.167
It had a broom for a tail
and a bucket for a head.

20:36.417 --> 20:43.626
I'm going to find that thief
and tear him to pieces.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.542
Where are you taking that bread?

20:55.792 --> 21:00.792
If she's that hungry,
she can come in with the others.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.251
Father hasn't changed.

21:17.459 --> 21:20.001
How could you bear him?

21:22.792 --> 21:24.751
But I didn't.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.042
Eat, Mother.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.417
I had you.

22:29.667 --> 22:33.459
Everyone needs something.
Even better, someone.

22:43.667 --> 22:48.042
I have someone.
- Very good.

22:55.334 --> 22:56.334
Mother!

24:06.292 --> 24:08.834
Godspeed, dear ghosts!

24:12.959 --> 24:16.251
How's life in the other world?
Get enough to eat?

24:16.876 --> 24:19.042
Can't complain.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.501
Of course not, if you have bread to eat.

24:26.251 --> 24:30.501
All we have is willow bark and slush.

24:32.751 --> 24:37.209
We heard the Rääk silver
is buried somewhere.

24:37.459 --> 24:39.459
I wonder where?

24:44.959 --> 24:49.292
We want to go for a walk
to pick some flowers.

24:49.542 --> 24:53.584
It's so nice out!
We want to make a wreath!

24:53.834 --> 24:57.626
What flowers will you pick in November,
you old hag?

25:33.501 --> 25:37.417
The body and blood of Christ.

25:39.376 --> 25:42.584
The body and blood of Christ.

27:11.084 --> 27:16.251
The peasants are listening
to the Word of God more and more.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.001
What are they doing?

27:35.042 --> 27:36.459
What are they doing?

27:40.126 --> 27:44.501
What are they doing?
- They use the wafers as bullets

27:44.751 --> 27:47.751
so they'll never miss
when they're hunting.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.459
What?
- It's the body of Christ.

27:51.709 --> 27:58.292
No beast can resist Jesus.
Jesus will bring it down.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.751
That is a sin!

29:16.876 --> 29:18.626
Give me work, Sander.

29:19.751 --> 29:23.001
A kratt needs to work.

29:23.251 --> 29:27.459
My master didn't give me work.

29:27.709 --> 29:32.084
So I wrung his neck.

29:34.626 --> 29:37.709
And who was that fool?
- Some shepherd boy.

29:39.292 --> 29:41.667
A child, of course.

29:41.917 --> 29:44.917
A kratt could never
get the better of a grown man.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.209
Stop staring.

29:56.459 --> 29:59.084
You'll never wring my neck.

29:59.334 --> 30:04.209
I didn't make you,
so my name's not in the Devil's book.

30:04.459 --> 30:08.584
Why do you think I pulled you
out of the mud?

30:13.417 --> 30:16.376
I came to ask for currants.

30:16.876 --> 30:19.042
Going to the crossroads again?

30:19.292 --> 30:22.542
Well, my last kratt caught fire.

30:23.584 --> 30:28.209
And I'm too lousy of a man
to manage without a kratt.

31:47.334 --> 31:49.834
- What do you want?
- To buy a soul for a kratt.

31:50.084 --> 31:55.626
A soul? Are you eating your kratts?

31:55.876 --> 32:01.709
Eat fish instead. They taste much better.

32:01.959 --> 32:05.292
My family eats tree bark and bats.

32:05.542 --> 32:09.417
We won't survive the winter
without a kratt.

32:16.542 --> 32:19.126
Write your name here in blood,

32:19.376 --> 32:22.834
and you can even make your pants dance!

32:23.084 --> 32:27.751
Shall we make those pants dance?

32:28.959 --> 32:31.251
Leave my pants be.

32:32.376 --> 32:37.542
I have a kratt body ready at home.
Just give it a soul.

32:38.334 --> 32:41.292
We can make my pants dance next time.

32:58.501 --> 33:01.584
Blood for you, a kratt soul for me.

33:01.834 --> 33:06.001
Go now. It already lives.

36:19.209 --> 36:23.459
That hit the spot! Pour me another.

36:23.709 --> 36:27.167
So,
how are things in your neck of the woods?

36:37.126 --> 36:38.667
It's a constant shitstorm.

36:41.876 --> 36:43.209
Fucking hard work.

36:43.459 --> 36:45.501
No time to take a dump!

37:14.626 --> 37:21.376
We can have the wedding at Christmas.

37:27.459 --> 37:31.792
The pig, the old cunt,
isn't putting on weight this year.

37:33.751 --> 37:39.292
She should be ready by then.

37:41.126 --> 37:45.584
Then we slit her throat and good to go.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.792
And how will you marry her
with a slit throat?

37:56.917 --> 38:03.792
Who?
- The pig. Your bride.

38:08.459 --> 38:14.876
What is this bullshit?
The pig isn't my bride.

38:16.251 --> 38:22.334
So who is?
- Well, you are.

38:23.417 --> 38:25.417
Me?

38:29.501 --> 38:33.751
Are you sure?
- Very sure.

38:34.292 --> 38:36.084
And I thought it was the pig.

38:43.292 --> 38:47.584
What is this bullshit?

38:48.084 --> 38:54.376
Pig and pig.

39:02.459 --> 39:04.751
I'm leaving.

39:17.042 --> 39:20.542
Everything set?
- Piss off!

41:22.417 --> 41:24.751
The baron's daughter
came to visit from Germany

41:25.459 --> 41:28.209
and brought a suitcase full of underpants.

41:30.209 --> 41:32.834
How many do you want?

41:33.959 --> 41:37.626
How can you take them?
Won't the baron find out?

41:38.251 --> 41:41.292
It's not his business
what I do with my underpants!

41:42.792 --> 41:44.792
How are they your underpants?

41:45.042 --> 41:48.917
Who else's?
This land belongs to Estonians.

41:50.084 --> 41:54.626
Everything on Estonian soil belongs to us.

41:56.834 --> 42:02.042
Don't you know about King Lembitu
and our ancient freedoms?

42:02.292 --> 42:05.209
How the baron's forefathers
unjustly killed our king

42:05.459 --> 42:07.001
and began ruling over us?

42:07.251 --> 42:09.417
That doesn't give them
the right to our land!

42:13.417 --> 42:15.709
I am an Estonian.

42:17.042 --> 42:19.834
Thus, the baron's underpants belong to me.

42:23.626 --> 42:25.792
Is that what you'll tell the baron?

42:26.501 --> 42:33.042
I'll tell the baron
that his underpants got horny...

42:34.292 --> 42:37.584
and ran off into the woods!

42:49.626 --> 42:51.876
How many do you want?
- Wait, Ints. Slow down.

42:53.376 --> 42:54.751
I have another problem.

42:58.376 --> 43:00.876
Can you sneak me into the baroness's room?

43:03.834 --> 43:08.126
A strange desire.
- Why?

43:12.584 --> 43:16.667
Isn't her room on our land?

43:17.917 --> 43:22.709
Don't I, as a descendant of Lembitu,
have the right to go in there if I want?

43:26.834 --> 43:28.084
That's right.

43:31.251 --> 43:35.292
And no German thug
can take that right away!

43:36.876 --> 43:43.459
Come to the kitchen door tonight.

44:00.001 --> 44:01.209
Luise!

45:56.501 --> 45:57.501
Hello.

49:35.209 --> 49:37.751
Father, someone was here!

49:38.001 --> 49:41.959
Calm down. There's no one here.

49:43.292 --> 49:48.251
It's your illness.
There's a full moon tonight.

50:10.084 --> 50:15.584
I love you. I love you.

50:16.334 --> 50:19.209
I love you.

51:32.292 --> 51:35.042
Move that stump.

51:57.001 --> 51:58.876
Move that by tonight.

52:03.792 --> 52:05.876
Let me help you.

52:09.751 --> 52:11.709
Keep it up.

52:16.334 --> 52:20.917
Well, men, taking a rest?

52:21.959 --> 52:27.126
Let's get to work! Take these...

52:27.376 --> 52:31.001
Asshole! You can't tell us what to do!

52:31.251 --> 52:35.792
Manor lackey! Ass-kisser!

52:36.042 --> 52:37.001
Hans!

52:39.334 --> 52:44.292
You weasel! Damned prick!
- Hans!

52:52.542 --> 52:54.376
Stop it!

52:55.584 --> 52:56.834
Don't do that!

53:01.209 --> 53:04.709
Hans!
- Your Hans became the overseer!

53:04.959 --> 53:08.292
Liar!
- That maggot!

53:16.542 --> 53:19.459
I want to be his wife.

53:43.626 --> 53:50.459
Witch, can you make him forget her...

53:52.209 --> 53:54.459
and love me instead?

54:11.459 --> 54:17.167
One thing we can do...

54:18.542 --> 54:22.667
is kill the girl Hans loves.

54:44.667 --> 54:45.834
I'll do it.

54:46.834 --> 54:50.376
Throw this at her window.

54:50.626 --> 54:53.917
When she looks out,

54:54.167 --> 55:00.417
the arrow will hit her head
and spill out her brains.

57:18.376 --> 57:22.001
Uncle! Take me across the river.

57:23.126 --> 57:25.292
I'll repay you with a kiss.

57:43.667 --> 57:45.042
Where's my kiss?

58:34.167 --> 58:37.376
Take your pants off
and put them on your head.

58:37.626 --> 58:42.751
The plague will think we have two asses
and won't dare to touch us.

59:58.917 --> 01:00:01.501
Drop dead, cretin!

01:01:03.584 --> 01:01:06.709
That was close.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.667
Get up! No time to waste.

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:59.626
The plague will be back,

01:01:59.876 --> 01:02:04.542
and we won't fool it twice.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.376
It has transformed into something else

01:02:08.209 --> 01:02:12.667
and we have to find it. Go look!

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:16.126
What the hell are we looking for?
Tell us what it turned into.

01:02:16.376 --> 01:02:21.834
I don't know. Use your heads.

01:02:22.584 --> 01:02:25.042
If you find something unusual,
bring it to me.

01:02:40.834 --> 01:02:42.167
That's a nail.

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:51.292
A mosquito.

01:02:57.876 --> 01:03:00.042
A button.
Haven't you seen a button before?

01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:10.501
A snail.

01:03:11.626 --> 01:03:14.751
What about the manor?
Will the plague go there?

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.334
I hope it goes
and strikes down every one of them.

01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:24.001
This is no time
to squabble with each other.

01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:26.042
Tomorrow we'll all lie side by side
in one grave.

01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:37.376
There's nothing here!

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.334
No, Liina, dear.

01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:52.292
This time,
the plague was cleverer than us.

01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:23.501
Well, hello!

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:30.959
This one couldn't bear
to show the coin to others.

01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:36.001
But the plague isn't a sausage
you eat alone.

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:46.251
Come on, then!

01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:51.376
Why spare the likes of us?

01:04:53.626 --> 01:04:55.542
We steal from each other

01:04:55.792 --> 01:05:01.626
but bury our haul or gobble it down.

01:05:02.459 --> 01:05:06.542
We should be happy
to be freed from our shame.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.834
I only ask one thing of you, plague.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:29.167
Let one boy and one girl live
to keep our race alive.

01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:41.376
Do you swear?

01:06:12.542 --> 01:06:13.917
Swear it on the Bible!

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:57.751
What happened, dear?

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:05.917
Hans loves her. And he always will.

01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:14.584
So you didn't kill her?
- I can't.

01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:22.792
If I did, Hans might die of sadness.

01:09:26.251 --> 01:09:28.167
And where would that leave me?

01:09:29.334 --> 01:09:32.167
Die of sadness?

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:37.959
Hans seems quite strange

01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:42.001
if such a death awaits him.

01:09:43.542 --> 01:09:45.834
Yes, he is.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:55.917
But that's why I love him.
Do you understand?

01:09:58.584 --> 01:09:59.917
Maybe.

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:05.667
Right now, I'm an old hag.

01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:12.834
But I once waited for a boy
to climb into my hayloft.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:14.709
Did he?

01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:55.042
Did you come to cheat me as well,
you scoundrel?

01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:59.542
I'll give your kratt a soul

01:11:59.792 --> 01:12:05.417
and in return I get yours.

01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:13.292
Now your blood is mine!
Here is the soul for your kratt.

01:12:28.167 --> 01:12:33.376
Greetings, Master!
And blessed be your home!

01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:46.501
I have a job for you.

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:59.001
I am truly sorry to disappoint you,
Master.

01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:01.792
But kratts cannot carry people.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:06.792
You created me for nothing,
and I regret my shortcomings.

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:13.876
I would like nothing more than to
bring two loving hearts together.

01:13:15.292 --> 01:13:18.126
Is she enchanting, your beloved?

01:13:18.376 --> 01:13:25.126
Enchanting? No. She is pretty.

01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:28.251
I can imagine.

01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:33.626
Skin like white marble, lips like velvet,

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:39.876
eyes deep like two dark springs
where the water is bewitched

01:13:40.126 --> 01:13:43.584
and drinking it makes you lose your mind.

01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:47.542
Where did you learn to talk like that,
kratt?

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:49.167
Everywhere.

01:13:50.376 --> 01:13:55.042
I flowed through old cities as a river,

01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:59.876
I burbled in splendid gardens
as a fountain,

01:14:00.126 --> 01:14:05.751
I fell as rain
and carried countless ships.

01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:11.584
Now I am snow, and for the first time
I have the ability to speak

01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:15.626
through the mouth you gave me, Master!

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:25.959
Well, Hans, what is this?

01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:28.542
Building snowmen like a child?

01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:36.876
This snowman is my kratt.

01:14:38.417 --> 01:14:42.001
You won't believe the stories he tells.

01:15:07.876 --> 01:15:12.376
Until a few months ago,
I lapped along the Venetian canals

01:15:12.626 --> 01:15:17.292
and a gondola carried two lovers over me.

01:15:40.584 --> 01:15:43.626
This is for you, for being so divine.

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:51.751
Now it is time for us to part ways.
We will never see each other again.

01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:58.876
Let this ring remind you of me.

01:15:59.126 --> 01:16:00.917
I don't buy it.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:07.417
If he was leaving,
why did he give her his ring?

01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:09.251
Was he stupid or something?

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:23.667
If I cannot have you,
then I do not need your ring!

01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:58.209
Maybe we can still find that ring?
I'll go look.

01:17:06.459 --> 01:17:09.959
Unbelievable stories!

01:17:12.084 --> 01:17:17.001
They're so enchanting.

01:17:28.084 --> 01:17:31.584
Enchanting? Where did you hear that word?

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:40.084
Do you want to take a wife? That's easy.

01:17:41.376 --> 01:17:45.542
It's about time we had a wedding
and got to gorge ourselves.

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:50.709
The woman... She's the baroness.

01:18:11.834 --> 01:18:14.251
You know very well why I'm here.

01:18:14.501 --> 01:18:17.501
I didn't come to warm my ass.
I want to marry Liina.

01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:21.251
I don't have time to wank off.

01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:23.834
We made a deal at the pub.

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:27.084
So let's finish the booze,
and that's that.

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:37.834
Drink this. It'll make your fur shine.

01:18:42.126 --> 01:18:43.417
I brought you a roll.

01:18:43.667 --> 01:18:48.251
Eat your own rolls!
And I hope you choke on them!

01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:53.876
Calm down. Endel is a good man.

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:56.876
But he doesn't stand for this behavior.

01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:18.084
Go away!
- You can't escape Endel.

01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:20.709
I'm your father, and I decide.

01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:45.709
You don't have to get married.
You can simply love.

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:52.084
I have seen plenty of young men
who cannot marry their loves...

01:20:54.042 --> 01:20:57.584
and write beautiful poetry about it.

01:20:57.834 --> 01:21:01.042
And when the lovers part ways,

01:21:01.292 --> 01:21:05.501
a dagger finds its way
into the lover's heart.

01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.709
I came to ask you for help.

01:21:32.834 --> 01:21:38.334
Liina came to me. She's very sick.

01:21:39.167 --> 01:21:43.876
She's in love with a man
who doesn't know it.

01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:49.501
A man who loves another.

01:21:58.126 --> 01:22:03.167
Sander! We can't let love destroy them.

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:08.542
I don't remember anyone going nuts
over something so insignificant.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:20.251
I was ready to eat poison toad
when you courted another girl.

01:22:20.501 --> 01:22:21.709
Did you?

01:22:28.417 --> 01:22:34.292
Oh, Minna.
I caused you pain back in the day.

01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:40.334
I did the same to you.
- My wife...?

01:22:41.542 --> 01:22:43.709
Yes, of course.

01:22:56.251 --> 01:22:59.334
Don't bear a grudge.

01:22:59.584 --> 01:23:02.376
It's in the past. Let it be.

01:23:45.667 --> 01:23:48.126
I feel sorry for you two.

01:23:50.001 --> 01:23:53.376
Why is your path so rocky?

01:23:53.626 --> 01:23:56.292
You seem meant for each other.

01:23:56.542 --> 01:23:59.709
The two of you with your frozen souls.

01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.126
I'm not jealous.

01:24:06.334 --> 01:24:12.084
I close my eyes and pretend
his words are meant for me.

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:18.667
I know that the baroness
will never hear them.

01:24:23.084 --> 01:24:25.084
Poor Hans.

01:24:35.626 --> 01:24:37.751
Liina, listen.

01:24:38.001 --> 01:24:43.334
Do you have a dress
that the baroness might wear?

01:24:46.459 --> 01:24:50.667
Why? I could get one.

01:25:18.167 --> 01:25:23.167
So this is the kratt
who's been pinching our treasure.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:15.251
Damn it!

01:26:20.042 --> 01:26:22.084
Do not try to hold on!

01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:25.667
I am the crumbling sand.

01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:29.876
Before the morning dawn,
I will be gone from your hand.

01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:35.042
Do not try to understand.

01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:38.751
I am a primordial being.

01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:43.626
Shining down divinely,
in every form and feeling.

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:50.251
I am the echo of an angel. I am true Love.

01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:57.626
Wherever you may need me
I am in your heart, my dove!

01:27:02.376 --> 01:27:03.334
That's good.

01:27:05.042 --> 01:27:10.001
If Sander brings us together,
I'll recite it for her.

01:27:10.251 --> 01:27:13.042
You can do that.

01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:18.876
But it is much more endearing
when a beau writes the poem himself.

01:27:21.792 --> 01:27:27.834
I have to write the poem?
I don't know how.

01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:32.751
Imagine your beloved.

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:39.167
The poem will write itself, trust me!

01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:18.209
You breathe like a calf. Like a small cow.

01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:26.084
How's that?
- Very good.

01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:35.584
Old pastor Moses caught me
scraping gold from the altar.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:46.334
He said he would send me to the gallows.

01:28:47.876 --> 01:28:50.626
Why were you scraping it?

01:28:52.417 --> 01:28:57.209
You know the altar is sacred.
- Of course! It's sacred gold.

01:28:57.459 --> 01:29:03.167
If I pay with it at the pub,
the gold will return to my pocket.

01:29:06.417 --> 01:29:12.042
How will it return? Will it walk?

01:29:12.292 --> 01:29:15.584
Jesus will bring it. It's sacred gold.

01:29:16.459 --> 01:29:19.626
Who told you that?
- A Latvian.

01:29:19.876 --> 01:29:26.376
Latvians have an ass for a mouth
and only shit comes out of it.

01:29:35.751 --> 01:29:41.167
What's your plan? To poison the pastor?

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:46.459
No, why? He's the hand that feeds me.
Let's turn him stupid.

01:29:47.626 --> 01:29:50.167
I brought some of his hair.

01:29:57.001 --> 01:30:00.792
Have mercy. Have mercy.

01:30:03.376 --> 01:30:06.292
That's enough. We don't want him too dumb.

01:30:06.542 --> 01:30:09.126
They'll only send a new one,
and he'll probably be worse.

01:30:10.167 --> 01:30:14.459
I'm going home to bed.
I was up all night drinking.

01:30:19.167 --> 01:30:24.084
What do you want? You can see I'm busy.

01:30:25.209 --> 01:30:30.084
I heard... Maybe you have... Well...

01:30:32.542 --> 01:30:36.959
What do I have? Speak up. Don't mumble.

01:30:37.542 --> 01:30:39.542
A love potion.

01:30:42.417 --> 01:30:46.834
A potion that makes a girl love you.

01:30:49.209 --> 01:30:51.834
You have to make the potion.

01:30:53.084 --> 01:30:59.126
Mix your sweat
and armpit hairs with your shit.

01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:03.376
And that's your love potion.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:11.459
Feed it to her, and she'll fall for you.

01:31:24.751 --> 01:31:26.709
Beautiful!

01:32:40.334 --> 01:32:41.376
My name is Hans.

01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:16.626
You're not cold, are you?

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.834
Two fools.

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:39.667
Luise!

01:34:55.084 --> 01:35:00.292
Look, Luise. I brought you a gift.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:02.126
I baked it myself.

01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:08.751
Why does it stink?

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:20.084
It's shit.
- No, it's not. It's... chocolate.

01:35:22.334 --> 01:35:24.459
That is shit.

01:35:28.376 --> 01:35:30.876
I made it for Luise.

01:35:34.292 --> 01:35:38.042
You disgusting creature!
Eat your own shit!

01:35:42.334 --> 01:35:45.417
Those are real feelings.

01:36:43.084 --> 01:36:45.709
This man shot Jesus!

01:37:43.459 --> 01:37:46.959
My God, you can't melt!

01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:49.917
I have to. It must be so.

01:37:51.376 --> 01:37:55.334
I understand you perfectly
even when you are silent.

01:37:56.792 --> 01:38:01.417
I have heard many passionate promises
and seen storms of emotion,

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:07.667
but here sat two lovers in silence.

01:38:07.917 --> 01:38:09.709
And it was beautiful.

01:38:09.959 --> 01:38:13.292
Do you really think that she...
- I'm certain of it.

01:38:14.417 --> 01:38:18.167
That girl loves you.

01:40:15.834 --> 01:40:21.251
Where is your kratt?
- It melted.

01:40:21.501 --> 01:40:23.501
Then it is time to pay!

01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:51.251
Hans!

01:41:46.167 --> 01:41:49.376
Your kind is a burden on humanity!

01:41:49.626 --> 01:41:52.292
You don't think twice
before cutting our throats.

01:41:52.542 --> 01:41:54.417
It's your own fault!

01:41:55.626 --> 01:42:00.167
Who told you
to make a deal with the Devil?

01:42:00.417 --> 01:42:05.959
Right, we should avoid your kind.
We should set you all on fire!

01:42:46.917 --> 01:42:50.959
You fool the plague and the Devil,

01:42:51.542 --> 01:42:56.709
but you don't want to pay
with your soul as promised!

01:43:09.417 --> 01:43:11.126
But I don't have a soul.

01:43:14.292 --> 01:43:18.667
You'll be boiling
in my cauldron soon enough.

01:43:48.209 --> 01:43:49.792
You went to the manor pantry yesterday.

01:43:50.042 --> 01:43:53.876
You could've grabbed a dress.
It doesn't weigh anything.

01:43:54.126 --> 01:43:57.376
Shame on you!
I got a sausage and half a lamb!

01:43:57.626 --> 01:43:59.126
Where would I put the dress?

01:43:59.376 --> 01:44:00.626
Over your shoulder.
- Hush!

01:44:00.876 --> 01:44:03.501
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:44:03.751 --> 01:44:07.459
have mercy on this soul sold to Satan.

01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:11.667
May your blood wash us of our sins.

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:38.251
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy!

01:44:43.792 --> 01:44:46.584
Have mercy on us, the sinners!

01:47:03.584 --> 01:47:06.751
