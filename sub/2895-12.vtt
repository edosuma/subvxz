in my place.

You want me to sign
a piece of paper

admitting that I was the man
on the grassy knoll?

07:08.813 --> 07:10.647
I meant what I said
at the ceremony, Louis.

07:10.782 --> 07:12.302
You mean the ceremony
that you only had

07:12.317 --> 07:13.534
in order to trick me?

07:13.651 --> 07:15.485
I had it because
you demanded it,

07:15.620 --> 07:17.487
but I'm not here
to talk about that.

07:17.622 --> 07:18.982

about Jeff Malone.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.040
What about him?

You may be aware
that he and I are--

I'm aware.

07:23.161 --> 07:25.495
I'm gonna let that go

also not be aware

07:27.832 --> 07:29.132
that I had to lie to him.

07:33.922 --> 07:35.472
He doesn't know
about Mike, does he?

07:35.590 --> 07:37.007
No.

than Louis,

13:30.716 --> 13:32.883
You mean Rachel
taught you how to eat.

busy at the moment.

13:40.358 --> 13:42.059
Too busy to take on this?

13:42.194 --> 13:43.194
What's that?

13:43.278 --> 13:44.729

that Jessica gave Harvey

13:44.863 --> 13:46.230
when he made name partner.

13:46.364 --> 13:47.898
Harvey said he wouldn't
let me have any of his clients.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.366
No.
He said he would.

13:49.451 --> 13:51.011
But then instead
of taking him up on it,

13:51.036 --> 13:52.319

to where we were.

in front of the judge.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160

No, we're informing you.

15:31.169 --> 15:32.670
Well, let me inform you.

15:32.838 --> 15:34.138
In case you forgot,
the TSA falls

15:34.256 --> 15:35.896
under the Department
of Homeland Security,

15:36.007 --> 15:37.474
which makes this
a national security issue.

15:37.592 --> 15:38.592
This has nothing to do

15:38.643 --> 15:40.511

15:42.097 --> 15:43.264
a large sum of cash
on a passenger.

15:43.398 --> 15:44.348
Now, how they came
to know that,

15:44.516 --> 15:45.683
how they proceeded
to investigate that,

15:45.817 --> 15:46.934
or what they did
with that information

15:47.068 --> 15:48.228
is the government's business.

you're going with?

That's not what

That's what they're

16:17.299 --> 16:18.632

I need something,

should either be,

that screwed the pooch.

23:46.517 --> 23:47.768
Oh, come on,
that is not fair.

23:47.852 --> 23:48.935
I didn't have all
the information--

23:49.070 --> 23:50.487
You had enough information

23:50.605 --> 23:52.155
to make a deal
to get her from Harvey,

23:52.273 --> 23:53.990
and part of that deal was
you backing me with Jeff.

23:54.075 --> 23:55.242
Oh, so that's why
you're here.

23:55.359 --> 23:56.493
You don't trust
I'm still gonna do it?

23:56.611 --> 23:57.944
Because you haven't
done it yet,

23:58.079 --> 23:59.919
and you have a history
of making poor decisions

24:00.031 --> 24:01.364
when things aren't
going your way.

24:01.499 --> 24:02.916
The only poor decision
I've made is agreeing

24:03.034 --> 24:04.167
to cover for you
in the first place.

24:04.285 --> 24:05.502
You didn't think that
was such a bad idea

24:05.620 --> 24:07.037
when you were using it
to get what you wanted.

24:07.121 --> 24:08.705
And now you're threatening
to take that thing away.

24:08.873 --> 24:10.457
Louis, you want
to keep Joan,

24:10.591 --> 24:11.591
that's on you,

24:11.626 --> 24:13.927
but I held up my end
of the bargain.

24:14.045 --> 24:15.545
You better hold up yours.

24:21.219 --> 24:23.637
(Mike) I just want to go over it
one more time, Professor.

24:23.771 --> 24:25.138
How much money
was in that pot?

24:25.223 --> 24:27.858
I'm tried
of going over it.

24:27.942 --> 24:29.559
Why do we have
to keep replaying

24:29.644 --> 24:31.027
every moment of this game?

24:31.112 --> 24:32.979
Because your entire case
depends on it.

24:33.064 --> 24:36.233
My case depends on the fact
that I won that money gambling,

24:36.317 --> 24:38.068
not whether I won it
with a flush.

24:38.202 --> 24:40.120
Your case depends on
the judge believing you,

24:40.238 --> 24:42.205
and if he finds any holes
in your testimony, then we--

24:42.290 --> 24:44.741
I gave you the names of
everyone I knew at that game.

24:44.876 --> 24:47.116
But none of those men were
there when you won that money.

24:47.211 --> 24:49.796
I can't help it if I didn't
get the name of the guy I beat.

24:49.914 --> 24:52.799
Which is why your story
needs to be rock solid.

24:56.387 --> 24:58.088
Okay.

24:58.222 --> 24:59.756
Go ahead.

24:59.891 --> 25:01.508
So I ask you again,
Professor,

25:01.642 --> 25:03.260
how much money
was in the final pot?

25:03.344 --> 25:05.178
Roughly $12,000.

25:05.313 --> 25:06.313
And you won that hand.

25:06.430 --> 25:07.931
As I said before,
I won,

25:08.015 --> 25:09.015
and then I cashed out.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.180
And what did you
have again?

25:10.184 --> 25:11.184
A queen-high flush.

25:11.235 --> 25:12.569
And who did you beat?

25:12.653 --> 25:14.104
I told you,
I didn't get his name.

25:14.272 --> 25:15.438
Okay, so what
did he have?

25:15.573 --> 25:18.358
Two pair,
queens over sixes.

25:21.913 --> 25:22.913
Wait a second.

25:22.947 --> 25:25.282
You said before that
the man next to you

25:25.416 --> 25:26.533
folded with two queens up,

25:26.617 --> 25:27.857
and now this guy
has two queens,

25:27.919 --> 25:28.919
and you had
a queen-high flush?

25:29.003 --> 25:31.338
I said that the man
next to me

25:31.455 --> 25:32.455
folded with two kings.

25:32.590 --> 25:33.456
No, you didn't.

25:33.541 --> 25:34.591
You heard me wrong.

25:34.709 --> 25:36.426
No, I didn't.

25:36.510 --> 25:37.961
Is this part
of prepping me,

25:38.045 --> 25:39.462
or are you accusing me
of something?

25:39.597 --> 25:40.797
I'm trying to get
your story to line up.

25:40.932 --> 25:43.216
- My story does line up.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

25:43.301 --> 25:44.935
Look, young man, if you're
gonna sit over there

25:45.019 --> 25:46.019
and call me a liar--

25:46.103 --> 25:47.187
I'm not calling you a liar,

25:47.305 --> 25:49.025
but if you say tomorrow
what you said today,

25:49.140 --> 25:50.140
we're gonna be
in a lot of trouble,

25:50.308 --> 25:51.348
because where I come from,

25:51.392 --> 25:52.943
there are only
four queens in a deck.

25:53.027 --> 25:54.861
I said two kings,

25:54.979 --> 25:57.480
and I'm gonna say that
again tomorrow.

25:57.565 --> 26:00.367
So you do your job,

26:00.484 --> 26:02.035
and I'm gonna do mine.

26:08.826 --> 26:09.826
(Mike)
He's lying.

26:09.911 --> 26:11.044
What are you talking about?

26:11.162 --> 26:12.412
Gerard's story about
winning all that money

26:12.546 --> 26:13.630
playing poker is bullshit.

26:13.714 --> 26:15.498
All right, slow down.
What the hell happened?

26:15.633 --> 26:17.334
I did the math,
and the hands don't add up.

26:17.418 --> 26:18.738
What do you mean
you did the math?

26:18.836 --> 26:20.670
I mean first he said that he
drew a queen on fourth street,

26:20.805 --> 26:22.055
and then when I pressed
him about it, he--

26:22.173 --> 26:23.223
Wait a second.

26:23.341 --> 26:24.925
This conclusion is based
on him recalling hands

26:25.009 --> 26:26.343
under cross-examination?

26:26.427 --> 26:27.427
Harvey, I got kicked out

26:27.511 --> 26:28.911
of Atlantic City
for counting cards.

26:29.013 --> 26:30.397
- I know this shit.
- It doesn't mean he's lying.

26:30.514 --> 26:31.982
I got a little experience
with that too,

26:32.066 --> 26:33.483
and I'm telling you,
he was.

26:33.601 --> 26:35.735
- Or maybe he's tired.
- Or maybe I'm right.

26:35.853 --> 26:37.737
Or maybe you don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

26:37.855 --> 26:40.440
- Why are you defending him?
- Because you asked me to.

26:45.279 --> 26:47.414
Look, Harvey,

26:47.531 --> 26:49.115
I'm not saying that
he took a bribe.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.953
I'm just saying that he didn't
get that money playing poker.

26:53.037 --> 26:56.256
Well, unless he admitted that,
he's testifying tomorrow.

26:57.875 --> 27:01.378
Since when do you stick
your head in the sand?

27:01.545 --> 27:03.513
- Did he admit it?
- No, he didn't.

27:03.631 --> 27:05.711
But he screwed up the details,
and he shouldn't have,

27:05.800 --> 27:08.601
because people who are telling
the truth get it right.

27:08.719 --> 27:10.887
And you know it.

27:25.641 --> 27:26.641
What's that?

27:26.675 --> 27:28.009
Jacks full of fours.

27:28.144 --> 27:29.811
I can see that,
but why--

27:29.929 --> 27:31.563
Why is it staring you
in the face?

27:31.647 --> 27:34.265
It's what I threw down
the last time I won a huge hand.

27:34.350 --> 27:38.570
It was six weeks ago,
and I can remember every hand

27:38.654 --> 27:40.355
that every player
at that table had.

27:40.439 --> 27:41.919
Now, if you won money
the other night,

27:41.991 --> 27:43.024
you'd remember it too.

27:43.159 --> 27:44.275
I do remember,

27:44.443 --> 27:45.944
and as I explained
to your associate--

27:46.078 --> 27:48.496
Yeah, stop bullshitting me.

27:48.614 --> 27:50.882
Where the hell did that
money really come from?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.083
'Cause if you don't
tell me the truth,

27:52.201 --> 27:53.641
I'm canceling
that hearing right now.

27:56.372 --> 27:58.590
It came...

27:58.674 --> 28:00.458
from a student of mine.

28:00.593 --> 28:01.759
For what?

28:01.861 --> 28:04.295
In exchange
for changing his grade.

28:04.430 --> 28:06.798
Jesus Christ.
For $25,000?

28:06.932 --> 28:08.633
He was going to fail
my class,

28:08.717 --> 28:10.468
and that would've stopped him
from getting an offer from--

28:10.603 --> 28:12.137
You goddamn hypocrite.

28:12.221 --> 28:14.639
You preach about ethics,
and you do this?

28:14.807 --> 28:16.691
This is about ethics.

28:16.809 --> 28:18.643
And you don't have
any idea why I did it.

28:18.777 --> 28:20.645
I don't care
why you did it.

28:20.779 --> 28:22.397
I care about what
you're making me do,

28:22.481 --> 28:24.032
because I am not
suborning perjury.

28:24.150 --> 28:27.068
Well, you tell me that you've
never done anything worse.

28:28.988 --> 28:31.039
I knew it.

28:31.157 --> 28:33.741
You would do it
for someone else...

28:33.826 --> 28:35.126
but not for me.

28:35.244 --> 28:37.245
You know what, Professor?

28:37.329 --> 28:39.380
There's a small part of me
that actually thought

28:39.498 --> 28:41.833
that you came to me because
you thought I'm the best,

28:41.917 --> 28:44.085
but you just think I'll do
whatever it takes to win.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.421
Isn't that what
makes you the best?

28:47.973 --> 28:49.493
Get someone else
to do your dirty work,

28:49.508 --> 28:51.392
because I'm not
suborning perjury.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.598
[Louis sighs]

28:56.732 --> 28:59.601
[grunting]

29:07.109 --> 29:08.193
What are you doing?

29:08.277 --> 29:09.277
[grunts]

29:09.411 --> 29:10.612
Getting my blood flowing.

29:10.746 --> 29:12.030
I've been sitting here
all night,

29:12.164 --> 29:14.999
and restless leg syndrome
kills 14 people every hour.

29:15.117 --> 29:16.277
I don't think
that's accurate.

29:16.335 --> 29:18.036
I don't care what you think.
What do you have?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.754
I found a way to fix
things with Joan.

29:19.872 --> 29:21.706
[grunts]

29:25.461 --> 29:26.941
Okay, you're arguing
anything in R & D

29:26.962 --> 29:28.082
is the intellectual property

29:28.130 --> 29:29.380
of the person
who suggested the product?

29:29.515 --> 29:31.599
Until such time that
the results become public.

29:31.717 --> 29:33.384
Which they did the second
I sent the board that letter.

29:33.469 --> 29:34.469
Except board members
are subject

29:34.553 --> 29:35.603
to the nondisclosure
agreement.

29:35.721 --> 29:36.888
Well, the board members
haven't signed

29:36.972 --> 29:37.889
a nondisclosure agreement.

29:37.973 --> 29:40.024
Yet.

29:40.109 --> 29:41.476
What's to stop them
from refusing?

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
Nothing,
but if they do,

29:42.611 --> 29:43.778
then the noncompete
kicks in.

29:43.896 --> 29:45.730
Preventing them from revealing
the contents of my letter

29:45.814 --> 29:47.065
under threat of prosecution.

29:47.149 --> 29:48.866
Specifically
corporate espionage.

29:48.951 --> 29:50.902
Oh, my God.
You got this idea from--

29:51.036 --> 29:52.320
- Our bylaws.
- My bylaws.

29:52.404 --> 29:55.156
Rachel, holy shit,
this is...

29:55.241 --> 29:56.658
acceptable.

29:58.794 --> 30:00.912
I think the word you're
looking for is "awesome."

30:01.080 --> 30:03.298
Well, the word I'm saying
is, "Get out,

30:03.415 --> 30:04.632
because I have a meeting
to prepare for."

30:04.750 --> 30:06.884
You know what, Louis?
I have been working all night.

30:06.969 --> 30:09.220
And this gets your ass
out of a major sling,

30:09.305 --> 30:10.922
so instead of dismissing me,

30:11.006 --> 30:12.390
you should be asking me
to come with you.

30:12.508 --> 30:13.808
Excuse me,
Miss Professional.

30:13.926 --> 30:15.426
You wanted me to treat you
like every other associate.

30:15.594 --> 30:17.314
- Now I am.
- By acting as if I did nothing?

30:17.396 --> 30:19.430
No, by acknowledging
you did acceptable work.

30:19.515 --> 30:20.648
Letting you come with me
is something

30:20.766 --> 30:22.684
that I would only do for you
if we were friends,

30:22.818 --> 30:23.818
which we are not.

30:26.438 --> 30:29.107
[scoffs]

30:35.497 --> 30:38.082
You canceled the hearing.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.834
You were right.

30:39.952 --> 30:42.954
He was lying.

30:43.038 --> 30:45.340
I'm sorry.

30:45.457 --> 30:46.674
You know, I knew
he was a hypocrite

30:46.792 --> 30:48.259
after I found out
about the gambling.

30:48.377 --> 30:51.179
I never thought
he'd sell out Harvard.

30:53.515 --> 30:54.716
What are you
talking about?

30:54.850 --> 30:56.050
He did take the bribe,

30:56.135 --> 30:58.135
but it had nothing to do
with the accident victims.

30:58.187 --> 31:00.355
He did it to change
someone's grade.

31:02.524 --> 31:03.524
Why would he do that?

31:03.559 --> 31:04.692
What difference
does it make?

31:04.810 --> 31:06.861
Either way, he was gonna
let me suborn perjury.

31:06.979 --> 31:09.113
It makes a difference because
we still have to win this case.

31:09.231 --> 31:11.115
Oh, I don't give a shit
about winning this case.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.735
[scoffs]

31:13.819 --> 31:15.820
I've never heard you say
anything like that before.

31:15.954 --> 31:19.073
You--you care
about winning every case,

31:19.158 --> 31:20.198
every game,
every argument.

31:20.242 --> 31:21.242
Did you hear me?

31:21.377 --> 31:22.910
He was gonna let me
suborn perjury.

31:22.995 --> 31:24.629
And so would
every client you have

31:24.713 --> 31:25.963
if they thought
they'd get away with it.

31:26.081 --> 31:27.165
He's not every client.

31:27.299 --> 31:28.750
No, he's the one you hated
in the first place.

31:28.884 --> 31:30.585
- I didn't hate him.
- Harvey, what is going on here?

31:30.669 --> 31:34.505
I thought he was
better than us.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.641
I sat in that class
and listened to him talk

31:36.759 --> 31:39.811
about what kind
of lawyers we should be,

31:39.928 --> 31:42.347
and I always let him down
because I knew

31:42.481 --> 31:45.099
that wasn't the kind
of lawyer that wins.

31:45.184 --> 31:46.851
And I wanted to win.

31:46.985 --> 31:48.853
So I'd argue with him,

31:48.987 --> 31:51.072
and he'd look down on me.

31:52.908 --> 31:56.944
And now instead of you
letting him down,

31:57.029 --> 31:58.279
he let you down.

31:58.414 --> 32:01.332
He turned out to be
no better than any of us.

32:08.207 --> 32:11.759
So then let's make him
better than us.

32:15.631 --> 32:18.516
[indistinct chatter]

32:22.354 --> 32:23.388
Miss Walsh.

32:23.522 --> 32:25.273
(Walsh) You are not on my schedule
today.

32:25.391 --> 32:27.892
Ah, ah, Miss Walsh,
please take a look at this.

32:27.976 --> 32:29.060

33:11.103 --> 33:12.103
In fact,
I fought for you.

33:12.187 --> 33:13.821
You may have thought
you were fighting for me,

33:13.939 --> 33:15.940
but I know that Jessica
dumped me on Harvey,

33:16.074 --> 33:18.693
and it seems that the second
you made name partner,

33:18.777 --> 33:20.244
Harvey did the same thing
to you.

33:23.198 --> 33:25.450
Oh, you didn't know that,
did you?

33:25.534 --> 33:27.869

meant for each other,

You should.

And while you're at it,
you should feel pretty awful
