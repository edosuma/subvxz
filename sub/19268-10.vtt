00:43.780 --> 00:46.230
You've reached 911.
Please speak. 

00:46.230 --> 00:48.290
Hello? Please speak. 

00:48.290 --> 00:51.480
Save me...
Save me... 

00:51.480 --> 00:52.860
Where are you right now? 

00:52.860 --> 00:55.790
Hello? Hello? 

01:01.400 --> 01:05.940
15 years 

01:17.760 --> 01:19.260
This is the case from yesterday. 

01:21.520 --> 01:24.450
As soon as we start to forget an old case, a new one pops up. 

01:25.910 --> 01:28.070
Is this why you called me? 

01:28.070 --> 01:30.340
There's something the media missed. 

01:30.340 --> 01:34.360
This is a recording of the phone call between the driver and 911. 

01:37.780 --> 01:40.610
Save... me... 

01:42.350 --> 01:44.710
Hello? Please speak. 

01:45.860 --> 01:47.050
Save me... 

01:47.670 --> 01:52.050
Where are you right now?
Hello? Hello? 

01:52.640 --> 01:54.090
You! 

01:54.090 --> 01:54.990
"You?" 

01:55.660 --> 01:58.140
According to the crew that arrived at the scene... 

01:58.140 --> 02:00.330
...the door was locked from the inside. 

02:00.330 --> 02:02.300
No signs of trespassing. 

02:03.820 --> 02:05.290
Maybe it was the passenger? 

02:05.290 --> 02:09.479
The results show that she died before the driver. 

02:10.710 --> 02:14.580
She wouldn't have called for someone who was already dead. 

02:14.580 --> 02:16.740
Who do you think she was calling for? 

02:20.640 --> 02:23.670
Tetrodotoxin was found in both of their bodies. 

02:23.670 --> 02:24.910
This substance is a hundred times more powerful than cyanide. 

02:24.910 --> 02:28.300
One of the ingredients was globefish toxin, lethal dose of 2 mg. 

02:28.300 --> 02:32.620
Colorless, tasteless, odorless... 

02:33.150 --> 02:35.900
Shortness of breath... These are all characteristics of being paralyzed. 

02:35.900 --> 02:39.690
This is a sign that the victim was conscious until her last breath. 

02:39.690 --> 02:41.890
Even though she looks unconscious... 

02:41.890 --> 02:46.110
She could still see and recognize her surroundings. 

02:46.910 --> 02:49.020
I didn't know you studied toxicology. 

02:51.010 --> 02:54.470
The cause of death is the tetrodotoxin. 

02:55.560 --> 02:57.210
But there's one strange thing. 

02:57.210 --> 02:59.900
The toxin was found in the stomach for one victim. 

02:59.900 --> 03:02.340
For the other victim,
the toxin was found in the blood. 

03:03.310 --> 03:05.570
How long does a full digestion take? 

03:05.570 --> 03:08.370
It usually takes around 6 hours. 

03:09.480 --> 03:13.220
They visited the restaurant at 10 AM and were found at 12 PM. 

03:14.700 --> 03:17.170
How could she have digested in 2 hours? 

03:19.180 --> 03:21.180
The method of entry was different. 

03:44.850 --> 03:47.750
A bar mistress and a doctor. 

03:50.510 --> 03:52.050
What an interesting combination. 

03:54.170 --> 03:57.460
Where were they headed this early in the morning? 

04:18.930 --> 04:22.330
It's the same type of mud as the ones found on Kim Min Sun's shoes. 

04:28.130 --> 04:29.190
It's strange. 

04:29.860 --> 04:36.930
A doctor should've known that breathing fresh air is vital when poisoned. 

04:39.570 --> 04:43.870
Kim Min Sun purposely went back inside the car to lock the door? 

04:55.910 --> 04:56.680
Yes? 

04:56.680 --> 04:57.890
Director! 

04:58.590 --> 05:00.570
I'm checking the globefish... 

05:02.730 --> 05:04.370
They're all homebred. 

05:05.380 --> 05:06.620
Homebred? 

05:06.620 --> 05:10.470
The owner must've received fake shipments. 

05:10.470 --> 05:11.480
Okay. 

05:12.680 --> 05:14.620
What's wrong if they're homebred? 

05:15.980 --> 05:17.990
There is no poison in homebred globefish. 

05:19.290 --> 05:20.170
Director Yeo! 

05:25.730 --> 05:27.210
Looks like this is a murder case. 

05:38.000 --> 05:39.930
The criminal poisoned the coffee... 

05:39.930 --> 05:42.710
...but made it look like it was the globefish. 

05:42.710 --> 05:44.970
After Kim Min Sun and Oh Hyun Joo drank the poison... 

05:44.970 --> 05:47.640
If the criminal cleared all the evidence inside the car... 

05:47.640 --> 05:52.130
There'd be no doubt that it'd look like they were poisoned by the globefish. 

05:52.130 --> 05:54.730
But Kim Min Sun didn't drink the coffee and so the criminal... 

05:54.730 --> 05:57.970
...stabbed her with a syringe out of shock? 

05:57.970 --> 06:00.220
And that's how the poison was inside her blood? 

06:01.340 --> 06:03.370
The mud on Kim Min Sun's shoes... 

06:04.030 --> 06:11.200
show that after being stabbed,
she had nowhere to go except to her car. 

06:16.180 --> 06:18.460
The fear in the victim's eyes... 

06:19.300 --> 06:22.070
She saw the killer outside the window until her death. 

06:23.450 --> 06:27.140
She tried to call 911 inside the car but it was too late. 

06:29.190 --> 06:30.910
They used up an entire bottle. 

06:34.280 --> 06:35.490
Was there a grudge? 

06:36.970 --> 06:39.630
If the killer already knew where the two ladies were headed... 

06:39.630 --> 06:42.860
...he must've known them pretty well. 

06:42.860 --> 06:45.760
They must've been really close.
Enough for her to call him out. 

06:46.600 --> 06:49.240
Why did the criminal throw away this picture at the scene? 

06:55.820 --> 06:58.580
Maybe there was a secret he was afraid would be revealed. 

07:02.410 --> 07:04.690
Were they friends who would die together too? 

07:06.800 --> 07:10.390
I Am 

07:26.580 --> 07:30.060
I can't believe it.
A murder... 

07:30.060 --> 07:31.840
How did you meet your wife? 

07:33.420 --> 07:36.450
I was her professor when she was doing her residency. 

07:39.510 --> 07:42.810
Were there any medical accidents for someone to hold a grudge? 

07:44.280 --> 07:46.330
Her skills were exceptional. 

07:46.330 --> 07:48.630
She was always thorough with her work and had pride for her job. 

07:49.310 --> 07:51.970
She even received calls from hospitals in America. 

07:52.500 --> 07:57.410
Someone with that reputation just declined all the job offers? 

08:00.990 --> 08:02.730
Something doesn't make sense. 

08:05.470 --> 08:07.280
It was because of her handicap. 

08:08.420 --> 08:12.270
In order to be successful in this field, you have to be recognized. 

08:12.270 --> 08:14.020
Attending meetings and seminars is crucial. 

08:15.610 --> 08:22.570
But, her handicap got in the way of her chances to become greater. 

08:27.040 --> 08:29.020
It was aerophobia. 

08:37.380 --> 08:40.400
When did your wife start taking tranquilizers? 

08:42.510 --> 08:44.650
6 months ago. 

08:44.650 --> 08:47.190
She had insomnia so I prescribed it for her. 

08:48.480 --> 08:51.620
Was she always close with Oh Hyun Joo? 

08:53.340 --> 08:54.670
They were best friends. 

08:55.790 --> 08:58.100
They've been friends since childhood. 

09:02.300 --> 09:05.290
Have you ever seen this picture before? 

09:11.250 --> 09:13.010
It's my first time. 

09:30.570 --> 09:34.700
How was the money flow here?
Any loans or debts? 

09:35.450 --> 09:37.830
Do you know how much income we make here? 

09:39.040 --> 09:41.520
Well. I guess there was a time when the business was unstable. 

09:42.620 --> 09:44.050
Was it 5 years ago? 

09:44.880 --> 09:46.930
You know that the bars closed down due to financial crisis, right? 

09:47.590 --> 09:51.230
The debt collectors were constantly bothering us. 

09:51.660 --> 09:54.120
But you guys got back on track fairly quickly. 

09:55.920 --> 09:58.550
The doctor lady solved all of our problems. 

09:58.550 --> 10:03.000
She brought all of her colleagues over to help raise our income. 

10:05.720 --> 10:07.380
I was jealous. 

10:08.190 --> 10:11.220
I wanted a friend like her too. 

10:13.180 --> 10:17.310
Even though they were childhood friends, it's hard to stay close... 

10:17.310 --> 10:20.170
...when working in two different fields. 

10:22.440 --> 10:26.390
But, their friendship lasted until the end. 

11:13.820 --> 11:14.650
Yes? 

11:15.560 --> 11:17.230
Pick up my calls faster! 

11:17.230 --> 11:19.130
You bastard, I tried. 

11:19.770 --> 11:21.710
Did you find anything from the evidence? 

11:21.710 --> 11:23.640
Only the fingerprints of the victims. 

11:24.010 --> 11:28.560
The toxin was only found in the syringe and a canned coffee? 

11:29.330 --> 11:31.470
Why was it only found in one canned coffee? 

11:31.470 --> 11:34.390
It was only found in one can? 

11:34.390 --> 11:36.270
- Yes.
- Okay. 

11:50.240 --> 11:52.640
The bedroom is a woman's personal space. 

11:53.460 --> 11:58.020
There aren't that many women who would allow smoking... 

11:58.020 --> 11:59.820
...in the bedroom unless they smoked too. 

12:00.930 --> 12:06.350
Therefore, having an ashtray on the vanity table... 

12:06.350 --> 12:09.640
...proves that they didn't sleep in the same room. 

12:10.680 --> 12:15.320
Separation at that age means it's money or another woman. 

12:15.940 --> 12:17.570
Or both. 

12:55.320 --> 12:56.960
I found it! 

14:57.310 --> 14:58.520
Lee Jong Hoon. 

15:00.560 --> 15:03.480
Why did the criminal only poison one can? 

15:04.050 --> 15:05.400
There's only one reason. 

15:07.330 --> 15:09.430
He only wanted to kill one person. 

15:13.190 --> 15:15.060
Your wife, Kim Min Sun. 

15:19.320 --> 15:22.610
I guess you were trying to find this photo but couldn't. 

15:22.610 --> 15:26.110
Why did you have an affair with your wife's best friend of all people? 

15:27.110 --> 15:28.720
You received many benefits from your wife. 

15:29.240 --> 15:34.000
Did you try to file for a divorce using this photo? 

15:34.790 --> 15:38.130
As a doctor, getting the globefish toxin should've been easy. 

15:38.130 --> 15:40.530
You probably told Oh Hyun Joo to poison the coffee. 

15:42.390 --> 15:44.860
But Oh Hyun Joo ended up drinking the coffee by mistake. 

15:44.860 --> 15:46.870
So that's why you took the syringe and - 

15:46.870 --> 15:48.160
Enough. 

15:49.460 --> 15:50.550
This photo... 

15:55.370 --> 15:57.380
I took it and sent it to her. 

15:57.380 --> 15:58.170
What? 

15:59.020 --> 16:00.760
I wanted to confirm. 

16:00.760 --> 16:01.680
What? 

16:02.540 --> 16:04.080
Min Sun's intentions. 

16:14.400 --> 16:17.810
You finished a difficult surgery so let's eat something good. 

16:20.360 --> 16:21.280
What? 

16:25.550 --> 16:26.840
Hyun Joo! 

16:35.790 --> 16:36.850
Sorry you had to wait. 

16:38.080 --> 16:39.600
Around 5 years ago... 

16:40.350 --> 16:42.690
Oh Hyun Joo was always in our relationship. 

16:43.140 --> 16:45.420
Sometimes it seemed too much. 

16:46.250 --> 16:48.740
It also bothered me that she worked at a bar. 

16:50.050 --> 16:53.640
But I let it go because I knew Min Sun was going through a hard time. 

16:54.570 --> 16:55.510
But... 

17:00.230 --> 17:01.310
Who is it? 

17:05.260 --> 17:06.260
Hyun Joo! 

17:12.490 --> 17:14.210
What brings you here at this hour? 

17:14.650 --> 17:16.900
Didn't Min Sun tell you she was at Busan for a seminar? 

17:18.770 --> 17:23.010
I didn't come to see her today. 

17:32.400 --> 17:36.150
Ever since then, she came over every time Min Sun was out of town. 

17:43.990 --> 17:46.190
Did anything happen? 

17:48.660 --> 17:49.430
Of course. 

17:55.490 --> 17:57.040
How was the meeting? 

17:57.040 --> 18:00.190
You know... same old, same old. 

18:09.300 --> 18:10.630
Did you know too? 

18:11.790 --> 18:12.540
What? 

18:13.280 --> 18:17.970
Min Sun stays at hotels every time she has a seminar out of town. 

18:22.560 --> 18:23.730
Is that important? 

18:24.940 --> 18:28.680
It's not like you guys married to have a family. 

18:29.830 --> 18:34.100
You married her for money and she for your reputation. 

18:35.290 --> 18:38.890
And I'm doing this because I love you- 

18:43.460 --> 18:45.480
She's a scary woman. 

18:45.480 --> 18:48.250
If you're that curious,
go ask her yourself. 

19:07.160 --> 19:08.930
It's not like you didn't like it. 

19:09.980 --> 19:10.930
What? 

19:16.260 --> 19:17.480
Let's end this. 

19:23.300 --> 19:24.430
All of a sudden? 

19:25.810 --> 19:27.790
You used to like it. 

19:29.010 --> 19:31.440
Look how far you've gotten since we first met... 

19:33.350 --> 19:35.200
We cannot divorce. 

19:40.210 --> 19:41.150
Not yet... 

19:49.170 --> 19:50.670
That was the end. 

19:52.280 --> 19:53.590
From that point on... 

19:56.250 --> 19:58.320
We were just married on paper. 

19:59.870 --> 20:02.340
I purposely acted more close with Hyun Joo. 

20:04.880 --> 20:06.720
But she didn't care. 

20:09.230 --> 20:15.190
I also want to know what their relationship was. 

20:29.970 --> 20:33.850
I've never heard of friends sharing their husbands. 

20:33.850 --> 20:37.660
He calls her by her name.
Min Sun calls him "oppa." 

20:37.660 --> 20:40.200
The names are all consistent on the statements. 

20:42.920 --> 20:47.560
The handwriting analysis shows that it doesn't match with the photo. 

20:49.390 --> 20:52.590
He might've tried to rationalize the affair but... 

20:53.780 --> 20:55.140
He's not the criminal. 

20:55.140 --> 20:56.360
Then, what is it? 

20:57.410 --> 20:58.930
It's not a mixed affair... 

21:00.480 --> 21:02.060
And it's not friendship. 

21:35.540 --> 21:37.100
I am... 

21:38.660 --> 21:40.320
I am... 

21:40.320 --> 21:41.440
What could it be? 

21:44.670 --> 21:46.630
Dictionary... 

21:48.210 --> 21:50.850
I am? I am... 

21:52.260 --> 21:53.520
I am... 

21:54.090 --> 21:55.390
I am... 

22:00.140 --> 22:01.320
Cute? 

22:05.150 --> 22:08.590
I guess I am kind of cute. 

22:17.180 --> 22:18.240
Murderer... 

22:20.000 --> 22:21.570
Murderer? 

22:32.320 --> 22:33.440
What are you doing here? 

22:37.970 --> 22:39.620
What the heck! 

22:39.620 --> 22:43.640
You can't just leave a mess because you're investigating! 

22:47.180 --> 22:48.520
It was here. 

22:50.890 --> 22:52.450
Have you seen this picture before? 

22:52.450 --> 22:53.650
Of course! 

22:54.800 --> 22:56.600
Was it 6 months ago? 

23:18.270 --> 23:19.790
Just from looking at this picture? 

23:19.790 --> 23:21.420
That's what I'm saying! 

23:21.420 --> 23:24.870
She turned pale and because a different person for days. 

23:24.870 --> 23:28.620
She didn't smile and never came out of her room! 

23:29.840 --> 23:33.320
I put the rest of it somewhere... 

23:33.690 --> 23:36.510
Geez, she's so picky. 

23:36.510 --> 23:40.740
She throws it away and then gets mad at me later. 

23:41.310 --> 23:42.620
The rest?! 

23:43.060 --> 23:44.660
Oh no! 

23:44.660 --> 23:48.340
I think I put everything inside the envelope and threw it out. 

23:57.360 --> 24:01.390
It was just here!
They must've already thrown it out. 

24:06.650 --> 24:08.180
Stop! 

24:08.700 --> 24:11.810
Wait! Stop! 

24:16.000 --> 24:18.900
Police! Stop! 

24:48.210 --> 24:49.660
What's that smell? 

24:57.840 --> 24:59.210
I found it. 

25:28.340 --> 25:29.530
I am back. 

25:30.050 --> 25:31.130
I am back? 

25:32.140 --> 25:33.550
What could this mean? 

25:34.610 --> 25:36.640
This girl has the answer. 

25:37.780 --> 25:39.720
Director, we found her identity. 

25:39.720 --> 25:43.350
Residence in Po Chun, age 33.
Name is Im Se Jin. 

25:44.000 --> 25:45.350
But the thing is... 

25:48.510 --> 25:50.280
She's already dead. 

25:50.980 --> 25:52.030
Dead? 

26:04.430 --> 26:07.840
6 months ago, a body was discovered at the fire scene. 

26:11.140 --> 26:13.540
The body belonged to Im Se Jin. 

26:13.540 --> 26:19.230
After living in America, she moved back to Korea near Po Chun. 

26:19.230 --> 26:22.240
The criminal set a fire to get rid of all the evidence. 

26:22.240 --> 26:27.090
All her valuables were there and there were no signs of sexual assault. 

26:27.090 --> 26:30.250
The only thing left were the footprints found at the scene. 

26:30.250 --> 26:31.160
And... 

26:33.750 --> 26:34.520
This. 

26:37.530 --> 26:38.990
June 29th? 

26:38.990 --> 26:40.680
The victim left a dead sign. 

26:41.940 --> 26:47.040
They tried to track down this date with related events and people. 

26:47.040 --> 26:48.830
But they couldn't find anything. 

26:48.830 --> 26:50.740
So it was left unfinished? 

26:51.120 --> 26:52.590
Not anymore. 

26:53.950 --> 26:57.160
This picture showed us the relation between the two cases. 

26:57.790 --> 27:01.440
Kim Min Sun started taking the tranquilizers 6 months ago. 

27:01.440 --> 27:03.490
It matches with Im Se Jin's death date. 

27:04.860 --> 27:07.860
Oh Hyun Joo received this photo 6 months ago as well. 

27:07.860 --> 27:08.790
So... 

27:09.620 --> 27:13.920
Kim Min Sun and Oh Hyun Joo probably knew who the murderer was. 

27:13.920 --> 27:15.640
Why didn't they report it? 

27:16.110 --> 27:17.520
Serial murder? 

27:18.880 --> 27:19.980
I am back? 

27:21.420 --> 27:23.260
This is a treat. 

27:24.040 --> 27:25.260
In the end... 

27:26.080 --> 27:28.270
He murdered all three people. 

27:29.050 --> 27:31.610
The murderer wanted to get rid of this photo... 

27:32.430 --> 27:35.610
...because he didn't want us to know the relation between the two cases. 

27:36.590 --> 27:38.810
The guy who Kim Min Sun called "you"... 

27:38.810 --> 27:40.780
...sent this picture to Oh Hyun Joo... 

27:41.600 --> 27:46.120
...and tried to leave a mark on June 29th. 

27:49.100 --> 27:52.030
The murderer is connected to all three women. 

28:06.310 --> 28:09.940
Im Se Jin didn't keep in touch after she immigrated to America. 

28:11.640 --> 28:15.280
So the connection started 15 years ago. 

28:16.580 --> 28:20.860
Even though they were all born in Bu Chun and went to the same schools... 

28:20.860 --> 28:23.660
There was no special case between the three of them. 

28:23.660 --> 28:25.780
They all separated in high school. 

28:26.620 --> 28:29.080
Therefore, the connection ended there. 

28:34.800 --> 28:35.720
Wait. 

28:36.840 --> 28:38.960
There's something strange about their high schools. 

28:41.440 --> 28:42.890
Myung Il High School... 

28:42.890 --> 28:45.030
Gang Jin High School...
Hyo Shin High School. 

28:46.430 --> 28:48.830
All the high schools are far from where they live. 

28:51.840 --> 28:52.880
That's right. 

28:54.560 --> 28:59.020
Why did they attend schools in different districts? 

28:59.020 --> 29:00.940
Far away and all different... 

29:07.500 --> 29:10.230
Kim Min Sun and Oh Hyun Joo knew the criminal and... 

29:10.230 --> 29:14.030
Im Se Jin marked the 29th to point at the murderer. 

29:14.030 --> 29:16.830
If the criminal was related to the 29th... 

29:16.830 --> 29:21.930
Kim Min Sun and Oh Hyun Hoo must've had meaning to that date as well. 

29:21.930 --> 29:23.860
But on their phones... 

29:24.540 --> 29:28.120
...only June 12th and June 26th was marked down. 

29:28.770 --> 29:31.490
What do these dates mean? 

29:33.530 --> 29:34.900
2 weeks and 3 days... 

29:36.060 --> 29:36.770
What? 

29:37.210 --> 29:38.770
The days in between those 2 marked dates. 

29:40.120 --> 29:40.980
Director. 

29:40.980 --> 29:43.400
All three came from the same high school. 

29:43.400 --> 29:48.150
But for some reason, they all transferred to different schools. 

29:48.150 --> 29:49.990
Even hiding the transfer records. 

29:51.280 --> 29:54.480
The connection happened right there 15 years ago. 

29:57.990 --> 30:01.250
15 years 

30:03.120 --> 30:05.890
Do you remember these 3 girls? 

30:05.890 --> 30:09.160
Of course. They were popular. 

30:09.810 --> 30:11.270
Popular? 

30:11.270 --> 30:14.920
They were the 3 princesses.
They had everything. 

30:15.340 --> 30:20.650
Their families were well off, they were smart and plus, they were pretty. 

30:20.650 --> 30:26.620
They were so great that even the teachers didn't say anything. 

30:29.070 --> 30:30.490
Was there an accident? 

30:30.490 --> 30:31.790
They were murdered. 

30:34.450 --> 30:38.430
Our only clue is the connection between these three victims. 

30:42.200 --> 30:46.910
Do you remember why they transferred 15 years ago? 

30:57.590 --> 31:01.900
There was a strange student named Park Soon Young. 

31:02.740 --> 31:05.640
Even though she was a bit strange,
she was still a nice kid. 

31:05.640 --> 31:07.990
That made the kids bully her more. 

31:52.870 --> 31:54.980
Only our class had a male teacher. 

31:54.980 --> 31:58.390
He was popular because he was tall and handsome. 

32:00.290 --> 32:01.080
Okay! 

32:01.620 --> 32:03.820
Who wants to help me after class today? 

32:04.430 --> 32:07.160
I'll buy you instant ramen! 

32:07.160 --> 32:08.730
Me! 

32:09.390 --> 32:14.580
When those girls volunteered,
nobody bothered to join in. 

32:17.070 --> 32:19.980
For some reason, Soon Young raised her hand. 

32:28.910 --> 32:31.650
Okay, Soon Young can help me. 

32:43.000 --> 32:44.640
A few days later... 

32:44.640 --> 32:46.460
It was gym class. 

33:11.840 --> 33:13.620
She just took a wrong step. 

33:14.180 --> 33:16.130
What does that have to do with these three girls? 

33:16.680 --> 33:20.930
These girls were the only ones left after class. 

33:33.070 --> 33:37.080
There were 4 girls and one fell off and died. 

33:38.200 --> 33:42.690
The three girls then became both witnesses and suspects. 

34:03.850 --> 34:08.260
Even if they were the criminals,
they wouldn't have testified. 

34:09.350 --> 34:11.650
Unless they confessed themselves... 

34:11.650 --> 34:13.650
...the case would never have been solved. 

34:16.260 --> 34:18.090
I tried to stop her... 

34:18.739 --> 34:20.090
But it was too late. 

34:23.100 --> 34:25.370
Only if I was faster... 

34:26.550 --> 34:30.770
What the... If Soon Young was still alive... 

34:30.770 --> 34:33.050
I'd buy her 100 of those scarves. 

34:37.050 --> 34:39.679
She took a wrong step... 

34:40.989 --> 34:42.420
And then... 

34:47.429 --> 34:49.300
She simply took the wrong step. 

34:50.790 --> 34:53.340
All of their testimonies were the same. 

34:53.340 --> 34:57.320
They said Park Soon Young was trying to pick up her scarf. 

34:58.270 --> 34:59.320
Scarf? 

35:01.260 --> 35:04.920
She said it was a gift from her mom and wore it everyday. 

35:04.920 --> 35:07.090
If you want it that bad, come take it. 

35:14.440 --> 35:15.360
Give it back. 

35:21.790 --> 35:23.470
That's when I knew. 

35:23.470 --> 35:26.930
Nobody can be punished if the victim is already dead. 

35:28.910 --> 35:31.340
I still get goosebumps even after 15 years. 

35:33.500 --> 35:34.880
How could something like that- 

35:36.430 --> 35:39.810
Do you remember the date? 

35:41.500 --> 35:43.120
June 12. 

35:44.170 --> 35:47.630
My birthday was the day after so I remember it clearly. 

35:50.020 --> 35:54.500
June 12th is the day Kim Min Sun and Oh Hyun Joo were murdered. 

35:56.280 --> 35:59.260
It's also the day the statute of limitations ended for Park Soon Young's case. 

36:00.500 --> 36:01.670
I am back. 

36:03.250 --> 36:05.810
The murderer came back on the same day... 

36:05.810 --> 36:09.440
...to make them pay for what they did 15 years ago. 

36:14.300 --> 36:15.370
Director Yeo. 

36:15.910 --> 36:19.160
Park Soon Young has a younger brother named Park Joon Young. 

36:20.690 --> 36:22.890
They both grew up with their grandmother. 

36:23.460 --> 36:26.850
Shortly after Park Soon Young's death,
the grandmother passed away. 

36:26.850 --> 36:29.050
Park Joon Young was sent to a foster home. 

36:30.420 --> 36:32.510
And then he became a fisherman. 

36:33.640 --> 36:36.860
If he was a fisherman, getting the globefish would've been easy. 

36:37.820 --> 36:39.540
He's a notable suspect for this case. 

36:53.220 --> 36:56.890
2 Weeks 

37:04.870 --> 37:06.760
Are you not going to try looking for it? 

37:06.760 --> 37:08.540
I'm having such a hard time. 

37:09.960 --> 37:13.390
The statute of limitations ended on June 12... 

37:16.150 --> 37:20.580
Then what happened on June 26th? 

37:22.770 --> 37:24.900
Maybe the statute of limitations ended on a different day. 

37:26.850 --> 37:30.080
The statue of limitations extends when you leave the country. 

37:30.660 --> 37:31.720
You didn't know? 

37:34.270 --> 37:37.330
But, Kim Min Sun had a fear of flying- 

37:38.970 --> 37:40.800
Was it 5 years ago? 

37:40.800 --> 37:43.050
You know that the bars closed down due to financial crisis, right? 

37:43.050 --> 37:45.380
The doctor lady solved all of our problems. 

37:45.380 --> 37:46.750
Around 5 years ago... 

37:48.440 --> 37:51.400
Oh Hyun Joo was always in our relationship. 

37:53.330 --> 37:54.350
5 years ago... 

37:57.350 --> 37:59.030
Where are you going? 

38:03.750 --> 38:05.790
I'm working my butt off. 

38:08.340 --> 38:09.660
How am I going to do this by myself? 

38:15.280 --> 38:16.790
I heard you found the criminal? 

38:17.790 --> 38:19.140
He's still just a suspect. 

38:20.170 --> 38:21.150
What did you want to tell him? 

38:21.150 --> 38:22.210
This. 

38:23.960 --> 38:27.730
I looked everywhere but couldn't find any needle marks on the body. 

38:32.780 --> 38:34.770
The criminal didn't use a syringe. 

38:37.180 --> 38:39.550
Is there another way to inject it without a needle? 

38:40.790 --> 38:42.470
Through the respiratory system? 

38:46.530 --> 38:48.750
What else do you want from me? 

38:48.750 --> 38:52.310
Can you tell me what happened 5 years ago? 

38:56.250 --> 38:57.770
What's the point in that? 

38:58.840 --> 39:01.490
The truth about your wife. 

39:07.450 --> 39:12.360
5 years ago, she was invited to present at an important lecture. 

39:12.950 --> 39:17.990
It was an honor for her to be invited at her age. 

39:18.510 --> 39:19.950
Will you be alright? 

39:19.950 --> 39:21.410
How are you going to get on the plane? 

39:21.960 --> 39:22.800
I'm going. 

39:22.800 --> 39:23.870
Min Sun! 

39:24.460 --> 39:26.750
I can't miss it this time! 

39:35.130 --> 39:39.940
Keep this a secret from Hyun Joo. 

40:04.370 --> 40:06.740
But Oh Hyun Joo found out. 

40:07.330 --> 40:11.230
Because of that, Kim Min Sun's case was delayed 2 weeks later. 

40:11.230 --> 40:16.210
Oh Hyun Joo has been using against Kim Min Sun for the past 5 years. 

40:18.580 --> 40:21.370
Oh Hyun Joo's statute of limitations ended but... 

40:21.370 --> 40:24.980
Kim Min Sun had 2 more weeks before her case expired. 

40:26.380 --> 40:28.930
This is the room that the customer stayed in. 

40:28.930 --> 40:31.980
Drinking and screaming all night... 

40:31.980 --> 40:34.470
Our customer complaints were no joke. 

42:03.350 --> 42:08.140
You were living in hell this entire time. 

42:34.080 --> 42:37.360
Not Kim Min Sun...
but Oh Hyun Joo? 

42:41.670 --> 42:44.060
We examined the inside of the car and found traces of... 

42:44.060 --> 42:46.950
...tetrodotoxin on the seat and floor. 

42:47.990 --> 42:49.490
The criminal must've sprayed it. 

42:50.320 --> 42:53.050
The only reason a murderer would use poison is it's certain. 

42:53.510 --> 42:57.000
That means he was 100% trying to kill someone. 

42:57.830 --> 42:59.620
But he sprayed it on the floor... 

43:03.080 --> 43:04.640
The objective and method don't match up. 

43:05.290 --> 43:08.000
The car's air conditioner is broken. 

43:18.700 --> 43:21.500
Do you know this person?
Park Joon Young? 

43:26.270 --> 43:27.650
Did he even look at it? 

43:29.340 --> 43:31.060
Did Joon Young, this bastard... 

43:32.130 --> 43:33.510
...cause trouble? 

43:34.390 --> 43:36.420
Is he the type to cause trouble? 

43:37.680 --> 43:42.910
He's a nice kid but when he drinks, he gets crazy. 

43:43.590 --> 43:48.550
I heard his sister died when he was young. 

43:48.550 --> 43:51.050
He used to cut himself... 

43:51.560 --> 43:55.700
Has it been 6-7 months now? 

43:56.350 --> 43:59.350
He disappeared all of a sudden.
He even left his stuff. 

44:05.960 --> 44:07.350
Do you know where he went? 

44:08.570 --> 44:10.130
I shipped his stuff for him. 

44:11.020 --> 44:14.680
I think it was... Bong Chun? 

44:15.280 --> 44:16.640
Bong Chun? 

45:19.030 --> 45:19.940
Over here. 

45:36.290 --> 45:37.580
Park Joon Young? 

45:43.940 --> 45:45.050
Park Joon Young!

46:32.130 --> 46:34.910
He suffered from kidney failure. 

46:34.910 --> 46:37.050
It doesn't mix well with alcohol. 

46:37.050 --> 46:38.580
Time of death? 

46:38.580 --> 46:42.470
Judging by the body's decay,
probably 6 months ago. 

46:43.310 --> 46:46.960
He died between December 25-26, 2012. 

46:47.510 --> 46:50.180
He stopped writing in his diary on that date. 

46:59.540 --> 47:04.210
6 more months until the statute of limitations ends for my sister's case. 

47:05.830 --> 47:07.900
Her death was unfair. 

47:09.890 --> 47:11.680
Poor sister... 

47:15.070 --> 47:17.480
If only I had more strength... 

47:19.530 --> 47:22.300
I could've made things fair for her. 

47:23.750 --> 47:28.730
They don't have the courage to stab me. 

47:29.470 --> 47:30.730
Bastards. 

47:31.810 --> 47:32.870
Sis... 

47:34.550 --> 47:35.650
I'm sorry. 

47:41.990 --> 47:43.700
What is this? 

47:45.520 --> 47:48.810
Wait, if he died on December 25... 

47:48.810 --> 47:51.480
That means he died 10 days before Im Se Jin. 

47:52.330 --> 47:55.900
His death is unrelated to Im Se Jin's death. 

47:55.900 --> 47:57.850
Who killed all three? 

47:57.850 --> 48:01.590
It's not like a corpse came back to life to seek his sister's revenge. 

48:02.110 --> 48:03.050
Here! 

48:03.890 --> 48:06.040
The statute of limitations date was marked on his calendar. 

48:09.920 --> 48:11.740
He must've been mistaken. 

48:13.810 --> 48:17.180
Wait... if it was June 29th... 

48:18.140 --> 48:20.140
That's Im Se Jin's dead sign! 

48:23.420 --> 48:28.990
3 Days 

48:30.870 --> 48:35.050
Park Joon Young thought the statute of limitations ended on the 29th. 

48:36.470 --> 48:41.000
Im Se Jin left a dead sign on the 29th. 

48:44.010 --> 48:50.340
How did she know that he would think the case was closed on that date? 

49:12.740 --> 49:14.760
I am back? 

49:28.130 --> 49:30.950
Was he really mistaken? 

49:39.750 --> 49:42.010
Save me... 

49:46.450 --> 49:48.100
You... you! 

49:50.170 --> 49:51.720
How is that possible? 

50:20.000 --> 50:20.950
It's Yeo Ji Hoon. 

50:21.600 --> 50:25.360
Connect me to the police who received the call the day of the murder. 

50:27.200 --> 50:28.910
Yeh Ri, the results are out. 

50:29.940 --> 50:31.750
It's the same handwriting. 

50:49.800 --> 50:51.720
You were the one who sent it. 

50:56.350 --> 51:00.740
The hiking boots from Oh Hyun Joo's house match the footprints found at the scene of Im Se Jin's murder. 

51:00.740 --> 51:03.350
The handwriting on the back of the photo belonged to Im Se Jin. 

51:03.350 --> 51:05.690
Im Se Jin threatened Oh Hyun Joo. 

51:05.690 --> 51:09.390
She was trying to tell them that she was back from America. 

51:10.010 --> 51:13.770
Im Se Jin knew that Oh Hyun Joo was threatening Kim Min Sun. 

51:13.770 --> 51:15.930
She wanted to do the same thing. 

51:16.680 --> 51:19.680
Wasn't Im Se Jin gone for 15 years? 

51:19.680 --> 51:23.610
Looking at the statutory date,
Im Se Jin had the most disadvantage. 

51:25.950 --> 51:27.630
There was nothing to lose. 

51:28.310 --> 51:31.250
She became bankrupt after 15 years of living in America. 

51:31.750 --> 51:33.540
When the case came up... 

51:34.100 --> 51:37.150
She probably thought that they had more to lose than she did. 

51:37.150 --> 51:41.400
During the 2 week gap,
another person was murdered. 

51:41.990 --> 51:43.380
Not 2 weeks! 

51:44.430 --> 51:46.520
3 days! 3 days. 

51:54.190 --> 51:55.580
This is in America! 

51:55.580 --> 52:00.710
Oh Hyun Joo was in America from July 5, 2001 to July 22. 

52:03.000 --> 52:06.060
It didn't show up in her records. 

52:06.060 --> 52:07.480
It doesn't show up on the computers. 

52:07.480 --> 52:10.430
Her departure records somehow disappeared. 

52:10.430 --> 52:14.890
Like the way Kim Min Sun was hiding it, so was Oh Hyun Joo. 

52:14.890 --> 52:15.790
So! 

52:17.770 --> 52:20.010
Oh Hyun Joo was out of the country for 17 days. 

52:20.700 --> 52:22.320
Kim Min Sun for 14 days. 

52:25.180 --> 52:28.060
If Oh Hyun Joo's statutory limitation date extended... 

52:28.060 --> 52:29.460
It would've been on June 29th. 

52:30.670 --> 52:33.750
Im Se Jin's dead sign was pointing at Oh Hyun Joo! 

52:34.880 --> 52:36.270
How did you find this? 

52:36.270 --> 52:41.470
During the past 15 years, only 2 people never forget this date. 

52:41.470 --> 52:43.910
The person who wanted to end this case and... 

52:43.910 --> 52:46.220
...the person who wanted to keep extending the date. 

52:47.840 --> 52:51.960
Would Park Joon Young really have mistaken this date? 

52:53.110 --> 52:55.920
He would never miscount this date. 

52:55.920 --> 53:00.730
So did Oh Hyun Joo also murder Kim Min Sun? 

53:00.730 --> 53:03.380
Kim Min Sun murdered Oh Hyun Joo. 

53:04.060 --> 53:06.680
The crime date was June 12th. 

53:06.680 --> 53:09.010
The last day of the statutory limitation. 

53:09.010 --> 53:12.120
Jun 12th doesn't apply to any of them. 

53:13.700 --> 53:14.940
Only one person. 

53:15.870 --> 53:19.560
One person believed June 12th was the last day. 

53:20.570 --> 53:22.100
Kim Min Sun. 

53:23.870 --> 53:28.890
During the last 5 years, she lived under Oh Hyun Joo's threats. 

53:28.890 --> 53:33.050
Because her statutory limitation date was longer than Oh Hyun Joo's. 

53:33.720 --> 53:36.360
That's why they both wrote down the statutory limitation date. 

53:37.190 --> 53:41.130
So when June 12th came around,
they both panicked. 

53:41.740 --> 53:45.980
Oh Hyun Joo's date expired but Kim Min Sun had 2 more weeks. 

53:46.600 --> 53:51.680
Since Oh Hyun Joo put her in hell,
Kim Min Sun couldn't trust her. 

53:51.680 --> 53:52.690
And so! 

53:53.750 --> 53:58.280
If Oh Hyun Joo murdered Im Se Jin and Kim Min Sun murdered Oh Hyun Joo... 

53:59.230 --> 54:01.280
Who killed Kim Min Sun? 

54:01.280 --> 54:02.940
The criminal who was at the scene? 

54:07.580 --> 54:09.120
Doubts and fears... 

54:11.920 --> 54:13.520
This was the last puzzle. 

54:16.390 --> 54:19.160
Let's go. I found the real killer. 

54:58.400 --> 55:01.350
On the day of the murder, it was over normal summer temperature. 

55:01.790 --> 55:05.550
Plus, Kim Min Sun's air conditioner was broken. 

55:20.620 --> 55:23.910
Congrats. It's finally over. 

55:25.750 --> 55:29.680
You're keeping your promise, right? 

55:30.620 --> 55:32.000
You don't trust me? 

55:54.290 --> 55:59.220
Kim Min Sun took a large amounts of sleeping pills and tranquilizers. 

56:00.360 --> 56:04.560
While pouring the poison into the coffee, she accidentally spilled. 

56:05.760 --> 56:09.240
That's why the car seat had traces of tetrodotoxin. 

56:37.640 --> 56:39.450
The view looks great, huh? 

56:39.450 --> 56:40.380
Yeah... 

57:09.500 --> 57:11.160
Save me... 

57:11.590 --> 57:15.430
While Oh Hyun Joo was drinking the coffee, she rolled up the windows. 

57:16.300 --> 57:18.470
To maximize the effects of the poison. 

57:24.130 --> 57:29.920
But, even she underestimated how powerful poison could be. 

57:30.670 --> 57:32.860
As the car temperature got warmer... 

57:32.860 --> 57:37.280
The tetrodotoxin on the seat vaporized and she breathed it in. 

57:59.480 --> 58:03.030
At first, she had no idea that she was being poisoned too. 

58:03.430 --> 58:05.820
She probably thought it was because she was nervous. 

58:06.530 --> 58:11.350
So she threw away the evidence and went back to her car. 

58:12.410 --> 58:17.060
That explains the mud found on her shoes. 

58:31.530 --> 58:34.320
But she called too late. 

58:34.970 --> 58:37.950
So she died accidentally... 

58:39.030 --> 58:39.870
Right. 

58:40.510 --> 58:42.550
So who's the one who locked the door? 

58:43.620 --> 58:47.050
Right. Are you saying the real killer is around here? 

58:50.180 --> 58:55.650
During certain times of the day,
the wind changes the direction of the sea. 

58:58.530 --> 59:00.250
It should show up soon. 

59:24.190 --> 59:26.470
That's what killed Kim Min Sun. 

59:27.300 --> 59:32.410
On the day of the crime,
there was a banner. 

59:33.770 --> 59:37.320
Kim Min Sun thought it was Park Soon Young's scarf. 

59:42.070 --> 59:45.900
Save... me... 

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:03.050
You... you! 

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.660
Give it back. 

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:50.030
She mistook the banner for Park Soon Young's scarf. 

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.660
Because it was on her conscious for the last 15 years. 

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.470
But how did she become mistaken by seeing that banner? 

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:03.360
And they also mistook something else. That scarf- 

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.690
It was white. 

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.900
Like Detective Baek said,
it's just an analogy. 

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.360
It was just her conscious coming out. 

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:15.910
But the fear in Kim Min Sun's face... 

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.810
There's no other way to explain it except through this. 

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:23.630
Every sin comes with a cost. 

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.270
I'd rather her have seen Park Soon Young's face. 

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:31.780
So... 

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.890
Since everyone related to this crime is dead... 

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.230
This case is closed. 

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.740
I didn't know you were into baseball. 

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.700
Why? Is it weird? 

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.080
You don't look like you would like it but you do... 

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.830
There'll come a time where everyone has to throw a breaking ball. 

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.850
You'll throw a good one. 

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.370
During Song Kyung Tae's trial... 

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.790
The court failed to recognize one of the charges. 

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.750
You mean Song Mi Joo's murder? 

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.080
How long are the two of you going to keep avoiding me? 

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.750
Director Yeo. 

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.830
Let's talk. 

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:42.550
Min Ho. 

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:44.010
Yes? 

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.280
It's going to rain tomorrow. 

01:03:52.610 --> 01:04:10.120
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment 

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.810
I'm going to die. 

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.120
Director Yeo! 

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.700
He was in his office the entire morning since dawn. 

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.830
F. That's what it said. 

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.510
I don't know why you're doing this... 

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.170
But we can help you. 

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.530
Director Yeo!
