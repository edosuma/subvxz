WEBVTT

00:32.066 --> 00:34.202
( door opens )

00:39.407 --> 00:41.142
NICE CAP.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.813
( theme music playing )

01:03.931 --> 01:06.033
( labored breathing )

01:06.134 --> 01:08.736
THOSE STAIRS WERE
SO HARD FOR ME.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.940
THIS KEEPS HAPPENING,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START

01:13.040 --> 01:15.276
GIVING ME THERAPY
AT CHEMO.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.746
TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE STONE.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.851
YOU KNOW WHAT
I LIKE BEST ABOUT YOU?

01:23.951 --> 01:26.487
WHAT, MY MORBID
SENSE OF HUMOR?

01:27.955 --> 01:30.191
YOUR EYES.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.993
I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME
I CAME HERE

01:33.093 --> 01:34.862
AND AS I WAS LEAVING

01:34.962 --> 01:37.265
I LOOKED AT YOU
AND YOU LOOKED AT ME

01:37.365 --> 01:39.733
AND I LOST MY BREATH
FOR A MOMENT.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.242
I KNOW.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.411
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA JUMP YOU.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.547
I'M IN CHEMO--
I CAN BARELY KEEP
MY FOOD DOWN.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.216
( chuckles )

01:55.316 --> 01:57.218
YOU KNOW,
THEY HAVE DRUGS

01:57.318 --> 01:59.387
THEY CAN GIVE YOU
THAT CAN COUNTERACT
THE NAUSEA.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.556
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
MY TYPE.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.559
BUT YOUR EYES ARE...

02:07.561 --> 02:09.363
BOTTOMLESS.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.666
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- OKAY.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.469
- ( inhales sharply ) OW.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

02:15.569 --> 02:18.606
I JUST-- I FORGET
I CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE

02:18.706 --> 02:21.175
BECAUSE OF THE THING
I HAVE THERE NOW.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.245
DOES THE PORT
HURT ALL THE TIME?

02:24.345 --> 02:27.348
ONLY IF I MOVE
A CERTAIN WAY.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.519
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THEM CUTTING ME OPEN.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.422
I DIDN'T FAINT
OR ANYTHING, DID I?

02:34.522 --> 02:38.158
- NO.
- DO YOU REMEMBER
THEM PUTTING IT IN?

02:39.727 --> 02:41.061
UH-HUH.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.198
DID YOU WATCH IT HAPPEN?

02:44.298 --> 02:48.369
NO, NOT--
NOT ALL OF IT.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.573
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE MY BREASTS?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.345
TRUST ME,
THERE'S NOTHING
REALLY TO SEE.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.883
BUT THANK YOU
FOR NOT LOOKING.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.888
AND THANK YOU
FOR TAKING ME.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.790
YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.262
YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY--

03:14.362 --> 03:16.264
I'VE HAD SO MANY
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

03:16.364 --> 03:18.966
IN MY HEAD OVER
THESE LAST TWO WEEKS.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.702
I MEAN,
LITERALLY EVERY DAY

03:21.802 --> 03:25.205
WE'VE TALKED FOR,
LIKE, HOURS AT A TIME.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.207
WE'VE HAD WHOLE ARGUMENTS
IN MY HEAD

03:27.308 --> 03:29.142
AND THEN--
AND THEN WE'VE MADE UP.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.346
AND WHAT--
WHAT HAVE WE ARGUED ABOUT?

03:33.381 --> 03:36.116
WHETHER LIFE
IS JUST BULLSHIT

03:36.216 --> 03:37.918
OR THERE'S SOMETHING
DEEPER BEHIND IT.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.187
AND WHAT DO I SAY?

03:40.288 --> 03:43.791
WELL, YOU DON'T SAY MUCH
EVEN IN MY HEAD,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.659
WHICH I FIND FRUSTRATING.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.364
BUT WHEN I ASKED YOU
IF IT WAS ALL WORTH IT,

03:50.464 --> 03:54.302
YOU SAID,
"OF COURSE IT IS, APRIL,

03:54.402 --> 03:57.871
IF YOU MAKE YOURSELF
AND OTHERS HAPPY."

03:57.971 --> 03:59.373
( chuckles )

03:59.473 --> 04:02.743
- WHAT?
- I'M SUCH AN OPTIMIST

04:02.843 --> 04:04.278
IN-- IN YOUR HEAD.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.647
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT?

04:06.747 --> 04:10.083
WHAT YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY DOING
IS GIVING YOURSELF ADVICE

04:10.183 --> 04:12.686
IN THE FORM
OF MY VOICE.

04:12.786 --> 04:16.857
- I KNOW.
- AND VERY SOUND
ADVICE IT IS.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.594
YOU'RE TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.234
ONCE I ASKED YOU
NOT TO GIVE UP ON ME.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.937
AND WHAT DID I SAY?

04:30.037 --> 04:33.206
YOU SAID, "NEVER.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.777
I JUST WANT TO HAZE YOU
FOR A WHILE."

04:37.778 --> 04:40.514
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I MEANT BY THAT?

04:41.181 --> 04:42.883
YOU'RE TESTING ME.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.586
AND HOW DO YOU PASS?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.857
I LIVE.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.731
DO YOU GET EXTRA POINTS
FOR TELLING YOUR PARENTS?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.836
ISN'T IT AMAZING
HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE CANCER?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.939
AND JUST, LIKE,
HAVING CONVERSATIONS,

05:06.039 --> 05:07.675
DOING SUDOKU.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.444
DID YOU SEE THOSE
TWO GIRLS IN THE CORNER
ON THE COMPUTER?

05:10.544 --> 05:13.180
THEY WERE
SHOPPING ONLINE...

05:13.280 --> 05:15.383
FOR UNDERWEAR.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.419
WE HAVE CATHETERS COMING OUT
OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS

05:18.519 --> 05:20.621
AND THEY'RE BUYING NEW BRAS.

05:20.721 --> 05:24.057
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
A LITTLE DENIAL

05:24.157 --> 05:26.226
IS NOT A BAD THING--

05:26.326 --> 05:28.996
BUT DON'T TELL
ANYBODY I SAID THAT.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.468
I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
SUCH AN ASSHOLE IN HERE.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.737
I TOLD YOU--
NO APOLOGIES.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.640
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T ANSWER
YOUR CALLS.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.544
I-- I MADE YOU
LET ME TALK TO SIENNA
DURING A SESSION.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.746
I SMASHED
MY FREAKING MODEL
IN YOUR OFFICE

05:45.846 --> 05:47.548
AND I LEFT IT
FOR YOU TO CLEAN UP.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.983
I MUST BE
THE WORST PATIENT
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.019
OH NO, YOU'RE NOT.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.123
THANK YOU

05:56.223 --> 05:58.025
FOR TAKING ME.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.261
AND THANK YOU
FOR GOING.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.632
NO, REALLY.
THANK YOU.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.401
I HEARD THAT.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.013
I HAD A BAD NIGHT
LAST WEEK...

06:21.615 --> 06:23.984
JUST A FEW DAYS
AFTER THE CHEMO.

06:24.084 --> 06:28.055
- I WANTED TO CALL YOU, BUT--
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.257
YOU CANCELED
OUR SESSION.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.725
I THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED A BREAK.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.828
APRIL, THAT WAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.765
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CALLED MY BEST FRIEND
LEAH INSTEAD.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.733
LEAH.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.103
I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU
MENTION HER NAME BEFORE.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.506
WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO HER?

06:45.606 --> 06:50.010
WELL, I-- I HAD WOKEN UP
FROM THIS DREAM

06:50.110 --> 06:52.245
WHERE I WAS
ALREADY DEAD

06:52.345 --> 06:55.015
OR-- NO, NOT EXACTLY.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.351
IT WAS MORE LIKE I KNEW
THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE,

06:58.452 --> 07:00.387
LIKE SOMETHING WAS
COMING TO KILL ME.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.422
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

07:02.523 --> 07:07.127
BUT I ALSO KIND
OF WANTED IT TO HAPPEN

07:07.227 --> 07:09.563
JUST TO GET IT OVER WITH.

07:09.663 --> 07:13.133
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
OF LOOKING AT THAT DREAM.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.938
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE PART
OF YOU THAT REFUSES HELP--

07:18.038 --> 07:20.373
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT THE DREAM MEANS.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.844
I WAS JUST
SETTING THE STAGE.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.079
UNDERSTOOD.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.815
ANYWAY, I WOKE UP

07:27.915 --> 07:30.784
WITH THIS
REALLY HIGH FEVER,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.554
LIKE SO HIGH
I WAS SHAKING--

07:33.654 --> 07:35.656
I COULDN'T EVEN HOLD
A GLASS OF WATER--

07:35.756 --> 07:38.992
AND I TOTALLY FREAKED.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.460
I MEAN, I REALLY--

07:40.561 --> 07:42.730
I REALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS ALL ABOUT TO END.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.566
THAT'S WHY
I CALLED LEAH.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.701
SHE CAME RIGHT OVER.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.504
AND SHE TOOK
ONE LOOK AT ME

07:50.604 --> 07:53.006
AND CALLED 911.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.542
AND ON THE WAY THERE

07:54.642 --> 07:57.044
THE AMBULANCE GUYS
WERE ASKING ME

07:57.144 --> 07:59.613
IF I WAS ON ANY MEDICATION
THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.917
AND I SAID,
"WELL, CHEMO."

08:05.118 --> 08:08.556
SO WAS LEAH IN
THE AMBULANCE WITH YOU?

08:10.157 --> 08:14.595
AND HER MOUTH JUST
SORT OF HIT THE FLOOR.

08:14.695 --> 08:19.466
I WAS SO OUT OF IT
I JUST STARTED
APOLOGIZING.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.335
YOU KNOW, "I'M SORRY.
I WOULDN'T HAVE CALLED,

08:22.435 --> 08:25.539
BUT I'M DYING," AND...

08:26.273 --> 08:29.209
SHE TOOK MY HAND

08:29.309 --> 08:31.244
AND SHE SAID, "APRIL,

08:31.344 --> 08:33.681
YOU DON'T DIE
THIS QUICKLY."

08:33.781 --> 08:36.984
SHE SOUNDS LIKE
A TRUE FRIEND.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.620
SHE REALLY IS.

08:41.889 --> 08:46.259
YET YOU HADN'T
TOLD HER ABOUT
THE CANCER TILL THEN.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.128
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
FOR A WHILE.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.999
SHE'S IN LAW SCHOOL,
SO SHE'S BEEN REALLY BUSY.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.535
HAVE YOU KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR LONG?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.138
WE, UM--

08:58.238 --> 08:59.840
WE SHARED
A BUS STOP

08:59.940 --> 09:02.109
WITH A BUNCH
OF OTHER KIDS.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.078
WHEN I WAS 10,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.815
DANIEL CAME TO SCHOOL
WITH ME FOR THE FIRST TIME.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.284
HE WAS TRYING
KINDERGARTEN.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.622
I WAS SO AFRAID
THAT EVERYBODY WAS
GONNA MAKE FUN OF HIM.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.524
AND THAT FIRST DAY,
I TURNED AROUND

09:17.625 --> 09:20.460
FOR JUST A SECOND
AND WHEN I TURNED
BACK AROUND,

09:20.560 --> 09:24.097
DANIEL WAS STANDING
THERE SINGING

09:24.197 --> 09:26.700
AND HOLDING HIS PENIS.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.837
AND I WANTED TO DIE
RIGHT THERE.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.072
I MEAN, EVERYBODY WAS
STARING AT HIM.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.675
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING

09:34.775 --> 09:38.946
UNTIL--
UNTIL LEAH SAID, "DANIEL,

09:39.046 --> 09:42.582
YOU CAN SING OR YOU
CAN HOLD YOUR PENIS,

09:42.683 --> 09:46.219
BUT YOU CANNOT SING
AND HOLD YOUR PENIS."

09:46.319 --> 09:49.422
EVERYBODY
STARTED LAUGHING.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.692
AND THEN ALL THE GUYS
STARTED SINGING

09:51.792 --> 09:53.894
AND HOLDING THEIR OWN DICKS.
IT WAS AMAZING.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.630
( chortles )

09:57.831 --> 10:00.400
SO SHE'S ALWAYS
LOOKED OUT FOR YOU?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.535
WE'VE LOOKED OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.038
HER MOM DIED WHEN
WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
SO SHE CAME TO LIVE
WITH US FOR A WHILE.

10:07.174 --> 10:12.012
SHE'S-- SHE'S REALLY
MORE LIKE A SISTER
THAN A FRIEND.

10:13.814 --> 10:18.085
YOU KNOW, HER REACTION
WHEN YOU CALLED HER

10:18.185 --> 10:19.653
REMINDED ME OF

10:19.753 --> 10:24.157
HOW KYLE REACTED
WHEN YOU CALLED HIM,

10:24.257 --> 10:27.560
WHEN YOU WERE
HAVING TROUBLE WITH
THE MODEL, REMEMBER?

10:27.661 --> 10:32.132
YOU SAID THAT HE ALSO
CAME RIGHT OVER.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.067
YEAH, SO?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.837
SO IT SEEMS LIKE
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE

10:36.937 --> 10:38.538
ARE VERY
COMMITTED TO YOU.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.341
I HAVE GOOD TASTE
IN PEOPLE.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.310
I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.279
I THINK
THAT YOU DEMAND

10:46.379 --> 10:48.916
INCREDIBLE LOYALTY.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.252
SO THE ONLY PEOPLE
YOU ALLOW TO GET
CLOSE TO YOU

10:52.352 --> 10:55.655
ARE THE PEOPLE YOU FEEL
THAT CAN MEASURE UP,

10:55.756 --> 10:59.659
PEOPLE YOU FEEL
THAT CAN REALLY
GO THE DISTANCE.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.429
I'M INCREDIBLY LOYAL
TO THEM AS WELL.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.765
YES, I KNOW THAT.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.702
SO WHY ARE YOU
MAKING IT SOUND LIKE
IT'S A BAD THING?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.204
I GUESS I JUST WONDER
WHY YOU WORK SO HARD

11:11.304 --> 11:15.642
TO MAKE FRIENDS WHO ARE
SO FIERCELY DEVOTED TO YOU

11:15.743 --> 11:19.212
AND THEN,
WHEN YOU NEED HELP,

11:19.312 --> 11:21.648
YOU SEEM RELUCTANT
TO RELY UPON THEM.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.818
- I CALLED LEAH.
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE,

11:24.918 --> 11:29.222
BUT YOU WAITED
UNTIL YOU THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE DYING.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.927
IT'S LIKE A BANK.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.030
YOU KEEP
TAKING MONEY OUT,

11:37.130 --> 11:39.900
THEN EVENTUALLY
THERE'LL BE NOTHING LEFT.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.803
SO YOU THINK THAT
THERE'S ONLY A LIMITED
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT

11:42.903 --> 11:44.772
THAT ONE PERSON
CAN OFFER ANOTHER

11:44.872 --> 11:47.875
AND WHEN THAT
SUPPORT IS USED UP,
IT'S GONE FOREVER?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.744
IF LEAH HAD CANCER,

11:50.844 --> 11:53.013
WOULD YOU GET TIRED
OF HELPING HER?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.982
NO.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.717
BUT NOT EVERYONE
IS LIKE ME.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.954
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
EVERYBODY IS NOT
LIKE YOU?

12:04.691 --> 12:09.296
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM,
THE DOCTOR TOLD ME

12:09.396 --> 12:13.166
I SHOULD EXPECT MORE FEVERS
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.805
AS HE SAID IT,
I SAW LEAH'S FACE.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.442
- SHE JUST LOOKED TERRIFIED.
- FOR HERSELF OR FOR YOU?

12:22.542 --> 12:25.278
OKAY. ENOUGH.
I GET IT.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.314
I MEAN, I GET WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
I JUST DON'T
AGREE WITH YOU.
IS THAT OKAY?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.884
OF COURSE.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.220
NOT EVERYONE
IS LIKE ME, PAUL.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.589
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY, BUT I'M RIGHT.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.426
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE CRAZY, APRIL.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.871
YOU CANCELED
OUR SESSION LAST WEEK.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.807
YES, I'M--
( clears throat )

12:53.907 --> 12:56.176
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.114
HOW DID YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU GOT THE MESSAGE?

13:01.214 --> 13:05.018
WELL, CONSIDERING
WE'VE DETERMINED

13:05.118 --> 13:07.287
THAT I HAVE A TOUGH TIME
RELYING ON PEOPLE,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.556
IT WAS A PRETTY BALLSY
MOVE ON YOUR PART.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.493
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:16.063 --> 13:20.934
I, UH-- I HAD
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.139
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.642
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TELL ME?

13:29.742 --> 13:32.913
COME ON. I TOLD YOU
I HAVE CANCER.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.016
JUST KNOW THAT
IF I COULD'VE BEEN
THERE FOR YOU...

13:36.984 --> 13:38.886
I WOULD HAVE BEEN.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.555
I KNOW THAT.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.096
HEY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

13:49.196 --> 13:53.600
UH, A BIT--
A BIT PASSED 50.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.535
'CAUSE I WAS
THINKING THIS WEEK,

13:55.635 --> 13:59.039
WHEN LEAH'S MOM DIED
SHE WAS 35--

13:59.139 --> 14:00.941
WE WERE 15
AND SHE WAS 35--

14:01.041 --> 14:04.011
AND I REMEMBER
HER BEING SO OLD,

14:04.111 --> 14:08.848
LIKE MIDDLE-AGED,
AND NOW SHE SEEMS
SO YOUNG TO ME.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
AND I WAS WONDERING,

14:11.084 --> 14:14.387
YOU KNOW,
IF I MAKE IT TO 35,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.423
WILL I LOOK BACK
ON THE TIME IN HERE

14:16.523 --> 14:20.727
AND THINK,
"WHEN I WAS 23
AND PAUL WAS 50,

14:20.827 --> 14:22.195
HE SEEMED MIDDLE-AGED.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.865
AND NOW HE SEEMS
SO YOUNG."

14:27.067 --> 14:29.602
YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.306
SO WE'LL KEEP
IN TOUCH?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.548
MY HAIR STARTED
FALLING OUT.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.787
THEY SAY I'LL WAKE UP
ONE DAY NEXT WEEK

14:47.887 --> 14:50.958
AND THE REST OF IT
WILL JUST BE THERE

14:51.058 --> 14:53.093
ON THE PILLOW.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.967
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO
KEEP IT FROM MY PARENTS
AFTER THAT HAPPENS.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.973
I GUESS YOU AND I SHOULD
START STRATEGIZING.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.908
OR MAYBE YOU
COULD JUST TELL THEM.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.345
I BET YOU AND MY DAD
WOULD ACTUALLY
GET ALONG.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.515
YOU'RE BOTH
SORT OF INTENSE
IN THE SAME WAY.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.318
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PART
OF THAT CONVERSATION.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.255
WE COULD ASK THEM
TO COME WITH YOU TO THERAPY.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.658
- THAT MIGHT WORK.
- WE COULD SCHEDULE SOMETHING

15:25.758 --> 15:27.760
BEFORE YOUR NEXT
CHEMOTHERAPY SESSION.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.797
NO, WE CAN'T.
IT'S TOMORROW.

15:30.897 --> 15:34.434
SO WHO'S GONNA
TAKE YOU?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.373
YOU?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.677
AND WHAT ABOUT LEAH?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.116
WHAT ABOUT HER?

15:49.216 --> 15:52.352
WOULDN'T YOU PREFER
IF SHE TOOK YOU?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.721
NO.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.560
DO YOU NOT
WANT TO TAKE ME?

16:00.660 --> 16:03.263
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF WHETHER I WANT
TO TAKE YOU.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.165
OKAY, ARE YOU
REFUSING TO TAKE ME?

16:05.265 --> 16:08.101
- APRIL, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD YOUR PARENTS.
- SO?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.803
SO YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IN PLACE

16:10.903 --> 16:14.307
- THAT YOU'RE NOT USING.
- I DON'T WANT MY MOTHER
TO TAKE ME TO CHEMO.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.710
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ME.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.379
I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT WHY

16:19.479 --> 16:21.981
YOU STILL CAN'T TELL
THIS TO YOUR PARENTS.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.351
- IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?
- NO, IT'S NOT.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.220
I AM YOUR THERAPIST
AND YOU NEED A THERAPIST,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.855
BUT YOU ALSO NEED
A CAREGIVER

16:28.955 --> 16:31.058
AND I CANNOT BE
BOTH PEOPLE.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.859
YOU MEAN YOU WON'T.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.728
- IT ISN'T APPROPRIATE.
- YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
ALREADY TAKEN ME.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.830
I-- I HAD TO DO THAT.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.833
- NOBODY FORCED YOU.
- IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.435
APRIL, YOU ARE
VERY SICK,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.671
- BUT I CROSSED A LINE.
- WHAT LINE?!

16:44.771 --> 16:47.074
- THERE'S NO LINE!
- THERE NEEDS
TO BE A LINE

16:47.174 --> 16:48.908
IF I'M TO CONTINUE
BEING YOUR THERAPIST.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.777
YOU JUST DREW
THE DAMN LINE!

16:50.877 --> 16:53.813
- APRIL, LISTEN TO ME.
- NO, THIS-- I KNEW YOU
COULDN'T TAKE IT.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.815
I KNEW AS SOON
AS YOU SAW THAT--

16:55.915 --> 16:57.984
THEM PUT THAT PORT
INTO MY HEART

16:58.085 --> 16:59.919
YOU SAID,
"FUCK THIS SHIT.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.954
THIS ISN'T MY DAUGHTER.
THIS ISN'T MY PROBLEM."

17:02.055 --> 17:03.723
OW.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.695
- OW.
- APRIL.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.205
APRIL.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.774
APRIL.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.644
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:26.879 --> 17:28.681
TELL ME.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.684
- I CAN'T.
- YES, YOU CAN.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.721
NO, I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.393
I'M GONNA FAIL
YOUR FUCKING TEST.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.162
NO, YOU WON'T.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.132
PEOPLE DIE OF THIS SHIT
EVERY DAY.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.601
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS AS
STRONG AS YOU, REMEMBER?

17:48.701 --> 17:51.538
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.008
I'M TRYING.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.745
NO, YOU'RE DROPPING ME.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.482
NO, I'M NOT DROPPING YOU.
I'M HERE FOR YOU, APRIL,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.118
- AS YOUR THERAPIST.
- UNTIL YOU'RE NOT.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.954
I WAS SO SCARED
LAST WEEK.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.056
I DREAMT I WAS DEAD.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.325
- I NEEDED YOU THEN.
- I KNOW.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.934
I HAD A--
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

18:22.034 --> 18:25.638
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOUR DOG DIE?

18:25.738 --> 18:29.108
NO.
MY FATHER.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.313
WHAT?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.151
IT'S OKAY.
HE--

18:38.251 --> 18:41.621
HE'D BEEN SICK
FOR A WHILE.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.526
YOUR-- YOUR FATHER DIED?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.796
( stammering )
HOW COULD YOU LET ME

18:49.896 --> 18:53.200
GO ON BLATHERING
LIKE THIS

18:53.300 --> 18:56.469
WHEN YOUR--
YOUR FATHER JUST DIED?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.539
- I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN--
- WERE YOU CLOSE?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.508
NO, NOT REALLY.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.310
WHY NOT?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.979
WELL...
( clears throat )

19:07.079 --> 19:10.250
HE-- HE LEFT
THE FAMILY WHEN--

19:12.018 --> 19:14.554
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.723
WOW.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.593
SO WAS YOUR MOM
AT THE FUNERAL?

19:20.693 --> 19:24.431
NO, MY MOM HAS BEEN
GONE FOR-- FOR A WHILE.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.403
- WHEN?
- A LONG TIME AGO.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.606
JESUS.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.244
SO YOU'VE HAD IT
PRETTY ROUGH,
HAVEN'T YOU?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.379
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.583
( sighs )
WE ALL HAVE
OUR FIGHTS TO FIGHT.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.387
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.422
YOU DEAL WITH DANIEL
EVERY DAY.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.058
GOD, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO DO THAT?

19:52.158 --> 19:55.795
- DO WHAT?
- TURN EVERYTHING AROUND

19:55.895 --> 19:58.498
SO THAT IT'S ABOUT ME
AND MY EXPERIENCE.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.734
CAN'T I JUST
FEEL BAD FOR YOU?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.304
SURE.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.040
WELL...

20:08.140 --> 20:10.343
GO AHEAD.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.191
SO ARE YOU...

20:25.292 --> 20:27.394
FEELING BAD FOR ME NOW?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.396
YES.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.598
WE'RE HAVING A WHOLE
CONVERSATION IN MY HEAD.

20:31.698 --> 20:35.668
I HAVE EXPRESSED
MY SYMPATHIES ABOUT
YOUR FATHER,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.905
AND YOU HAVE GRATEFULLY
AND GRACIOUSLY

20:39.005 --> 20:40.940
ACCEPTED
MY CONDOLENCES.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.010
GOOD.

20:44.110 --> 20:48.615
YOU KNOW,
HAVING A FANTASY LIFE
AS POWERFUL AS THAT--

20:48.715 --> 20:51.651
THE ABILITY TO PLAY OUT
WHOLE SCENARIOS

20:51.751 --> 20:53.786
IN YOUR HEAD--

20:53.886 --> 20:57.457
THAT'S-- THAT'S THE MARK
OF A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT PERSON.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.827
- REALLY?
- YES, ACCORDING
TO SOME STUDIES.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.996
AND WHAT DO THE OTHER
STUDIES CONSIDER IT
A SIGN OF?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.032
UTTER INSANITY.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.337
( chuckles )

21:16.042 --> 21:19.946
OKAY. CAN WE GO BACK
TO TALKING ABOUT YOUR
CHEMO SESSION TOMORROW?

21:23.483 --> 21:26.018
- WHO CAN TAKE YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.521
I UNDERSTAND
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER...

21:28.621 --> 21:31.624
- NO.
- ...AND I APPRECIATE LEAH
CAN'T TAKE THE STRESS...

21:31.724 --> 21:34.494
- YEAH. SHE'S GOT MIDTERMS.
- ...BUT YOU MUST HAVE
OTHER FRIENDS

21:34.594 --> 21:37.263
- WHO WOULD LIKE
TO BE THERE.
- I GUESS SO.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.999
WHAT-- WHAT ABOUT KYLE?

21:43.235 --> 21:45.638
APRIL...

21:45.738 --> 21:48.375
WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHO'S GONNA TAKE YOU,

21:48.475 --> 21:50.710
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.879
WHY?

21:52.979 --> 21:56.649
I WANT TO KNOW THAT
YOU'VE FOUND SOMEBODY.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.657
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR DAD, PAUL.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.750
( breathing heavily )

22:47.099 --> 22:49.201
( door opens )

22:49.301 --> 22:50.770
( door closes )
