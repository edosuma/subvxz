(Man)
Yes!

00:08.642 --> 00:09.677
Ha, ha!
I swear to Bon Jovi,

00:09.710 --> 00:11.545
if these sad sacks
end up winning,

00:11.579 --> 00:13.147
I'm gonna
divorce you, Ray.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.416
We'll call Lev and have him
draw up the paperwork,

00:15.449 --> 00:18.186
'cause the Giants are 20 yards
away from the Super Bowl, baby!

00:18.219 --> 00:20.154
They ain't
gonna make it.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.456
Just like you wouldn't make it
one day without me.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.592
Yeah, you got me there.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.760
(TV announcer)
Giants are set up on the...

00:26.794 --> 00:29.397
Ahh, come on, guys.
This game better hurry up.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.565
We're gonna be late
to coach Tiny Tots.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.800
Yeah, well,
don't worry,

00:32.833 --> 00:35.103
my boys'll make
quick work of you.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.372
Huh, that's funny.
(gasping)

00:38.406 --> 00:39.807
Why are they your boys?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.742
Dude, please don't do
your show right now.

00:41.775 --> 00:42.810
So, you know this hairdo?

00:42.843 --> 00:45.746
Well, please inform him
that the Rams are my boys

00:45.779 --> 00:47.815
because they're
from my hometown.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.317
But none of the players
are from there.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.651
They change every year,

00:50.684 --> 00:52.786
and your team
just switched cities.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.322
(chuckling)
You know, this reminds me

00:54.355 --> 00:55.656
of a famous
thought experiment.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.325
Shut up!
The game is on.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.459
I'll pause it.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.231
Say this sandwich
is your team.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.632
(small gasp)
Over time,

01:04.665 --> 01:06.167
every part of it changes.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.136
The turkey gets
traded to Denver,

01:08.169 --> 01:10.104
the tomato gets suspended
for dog fighting,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.206
and the bread can't
close a stadium deal.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.708
So, a philosopher would ask,
"Is it even the same sandwich?"

01:14.742 --> 01:16.344
Hah.
(coughs)

01:16.377 --> 01:17.845
(TV announcer)
...On the L.A. 23 yard line...

01:17.878 --> 01:19.180
Tastes the same to me,
Plato.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.282
My heart stopped.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.317
That's what's so weird
about being a sports fan.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.187
Everything but the name
changes year to year,

01:26.220 --> 01:28.289
but we still love
our team just as much.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.158
It's like we're really just
a fan of the logo.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.361
Great, 'cause my logo is
about to win the playoffs.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.828
'Cause they're the best!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.864
Oh, the playoffs don't
pick which team is best.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.467
In fact, the playoffs are
a random and chaotic system

01:39.500 --> 01:40.901
that's little better
than a coin flip.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.736
Buckle in, here we go.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.172
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.886
Adam, please don't
ruin football.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.489
My folks take it
really seriously.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.791
This human Prius?
Ruin football?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.526
Yeah, right.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.396
Football is the bond that
holds this family together.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.531
My family's
the exact same way.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.367
Except about books
and with zero affection.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.469
But look, I'm a huge
football fan, too.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.405
I mean, I'm wearing
my favorite team's colors:

02:17.438 --> 02:18.706
The New York Yankees.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.574
That's a baseball team.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.510
Yes, but there was
also a football team called

02:22.543 --> 02:25.579
the New York Yankees that
played from 1926 through 1929.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.582
Why do you have
to be so specific?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.285
Great, now get
your amber waves of grain

02:31.319 --> 02:33.287
out of the way because
we're about to find out

02:33.321 --> 02:35.689
which of these teams
is better at football.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.358
Gladly.
Ahh!

02:37.391 --> 02:38.492
But as I was saying,

02:38.526 --> 02:39.927
the playoffs don't do
any such thing.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.895
In fact, they more or less
pick the winner at random.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.497
Okay, he's teleporting,

02:43.531 --> 02:44.898
I'm gonna go make
a sandwich for half an hour,

02:44.932 --> 02:46.033
Godspeed, family!

02:46.066 --> 02:47.901
Historically, the team
with the best record

02:47.935 --> 02:50.438
wins the Super Bowl
less than half the time.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.840
It's actually more common
for a worse team to win.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.909
(chuckles)
Shut your mouth!

02:55.943 --> 02:58.346
My Giants were
the champs in 2011,

02:58.379 --> 02:59.580
they were number one!

02:59.613 --> 03:02.316
Uh, no,
they were number ten.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.719
The Giants regular season record
that year was nine and seven,

03:05.753 --> 03:08.756
the worst record of any team
to ever win a Super Bowl.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.791
But in the playoffs,
they beat the Packers,

03:10.824 --> 03:13.527
who only lost
a single game all year.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.762
I hate to tell you this,

03:14.795 --> 03:15.929
but the Giants
weren't the better team.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.299
They were definitely
the worst team,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.301
and they just got lucky.
Luck you!

03:24.505 --> 03:25.939
Aah!

03:25.973 --> 03:27.475
(Adam)
Any team can win one game.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.642
The problem
with the playoffs

03:28.676 --> 03:31.279
is they have way too small
of a sample size.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.282
Sample size?
What, like Halloween candy?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.916
No. Look, you're
from Jersey, right?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.818
Let me put it
in Jersey terms.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.787
Let's compare
Bruce Springsteen...

03:39.820 --> 03:42.290
♪ Baby we were born to run

Oh, my God,
Bruce Springsteen!

03:46.994 --> 03:48.729

And Billy Joel.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.668
I've been waiting in here
for the longest time.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.438
Oh, my God,
Bruce Springsteen!

03:57.471 --> 04:01.509
Over his career,
Billy Joel has won six Grammys.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.477
Bruce here has won 20.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.812
Yeah!

04:04.845 --> 04:07.448
But on February 25, 1981,

04:07.481 --> 04:10.651
Billy beat Bruce for
Best Rock Vocal Performance.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.520
If you decide
the whole contest

04:12.553 --> 04:14.288
based on one day
in February,

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
Billy wins.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.458
Bruce was robbed.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.393
His heart was
hungrier than mine.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.962
It's exactly the same
with the playoffs.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.497
Just 'cause
you win on one day,

04:23.531 --> 04:24.998
it doesn't make you
the better team.

04:25.032 --> 04:25.999
It's luck.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.936
Okay, Mr. Spreadsheet, fine.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.938
Maybe football does have
a small sample size.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.840
But what about
the World Series?

04:32.873 --> 04:33.974
Best of seven.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.809
Oh, baseball's
even worse.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.978
It's actually
the most random major sport.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.047

Since 1995,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.849

the best regular season record

04:41.882 --> 04:43.484
has won the World Series

04:43.517 --> 04:45.753
just 16% of the time.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.020
Ugh.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.656
I don't believe you.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.724
You're not a sports nerd,
you're just a regular nerd.

General Manager Billy Beane,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.331

Long story short, you might
as well skip the Super Bowl

05:05.839 --> 05:08.742

to whoever wins the coin flip.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the NFL champion is: Heads!

05:17.418 --> 05:18.919
I get to yell at Joe Buck.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.755
You'd be surprised at
what his name rhymes with.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.758
And I like a little
randomness in my sports.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.829
The playoffs give Patty's crappy
underdog team a chance to win.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.932
Exactly, that's why
the playoffs are fun.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.768
Because that's when
the objectively worse underdogs

05:34.802 --> 05:37.104
can beat their
athletic superiors.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.007
Face it, we don't like sports
because they're rational.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.742
We like them
because they're random

05:41.775 --> 05:43.644

08:35.148 --> 08:37.618
'Cause the more water you drink,
the better you feel.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.919
Drink more water!

08:38.952 --> 08:41.254
These companies have
consistently portrayed

08:41.288 --> 08:43.591
dehydration
as a serious threat

08:43.624 --> 08:47.227
for one, simple reason--
it gets us to drink more.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.597
The International
Bottled Water Association

08:49.630 --> 08:51.899
publishes
a hydration calculator

08:51.932 --> 08:54.635
that can recommend you drink
two liters of water a day.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.336
Dasani tells you
that hydration is healthy,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.271
so drink up,
preferably Dasani.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.773
Paid spokesman
Dustin Pedroia

08:59.807 --> 09:01.909
says he always hydrates
with Vita Coco

09:01.942 --> 09:04.612
because it prevents cramps,
even though it doesn't.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.913
And in "Runner's World"
magazine,

09:05.946 --> 09:08.281
Gatorade ran an ad
masquerading as an article

09:08.315 --> 09:10.618
titled "Hydration 101."

09:10.651 --> 09:12.886
It included tips like
"drink early and often,"

09:12.920 --> 09:14.922
"don't wait
until you feel thirsty"

09:14.955 --> 09:17.257
and "always drinks
sports drinks."

09:17.290 --> 09:19.059
But that's all
real science, right?

09:19.092 --> 09:20.728
Ah, here's where
it gets sticky.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.329
That ad was
sponsored by

09:22.362 --> 09:24.632
the Gatorade Sports
Science Institute,

09:24.665 --> 09:27.768
which was founded
by Gatorade in 1985.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.269
Its scientific mission?

09:29.302 --> 09:31.639
To discover
exciting new reasons

09:31.672 --> 09:33.173
people should drink
their product.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.675
Our unbiased study found

09:34.708 --> 09:36.677
that people should
drink a lot of Gatorade.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.812
Terrific work,
alert the media!

09:38.846 --> 09:40.313
We also may have found
a cure for cancer.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.049
Was it Gatorade?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.984
Damn it!

09:44.017 --> 09:45.753
Get back to me
when it's Gatorade!

09:45.786 --> 09:48.789
Gatorade also sponsors
sports science research

09:48.822 --> 09:50.924
at universities
across America,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.660
and this can influence
their findings.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.294
♪ Money, money...

09:54.327 --> 09:57.698
The American College of Sports
Medicine once recommended...

09:57.731 --> 10:00.634
When exercising, you should
drink as much as tolerable.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.970
♪ Money, money...

10:03.003 --> 10:04.037
♪ It's all about the money

10:04.071 --> 10:05.839
Other companies
soon followed suit.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.842
Evian's parent company
founded Hydration for Health,

10:08.876 --> 10:09.710
a group that...

10:13.346 --> 10:15.182
Important research,
everybody!

10:15.215 --> 10:16.316
Drink Evian!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.886
Science says so.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.154
Oh, I gotta tell
the Tots about this.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.891
(Adam)
And, after decades
of bad science and marketing,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.894
we now believe dehydration
is a dire threat.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.329
Gotta drink,
drink or I'll die!

10:29.362 --> 10:31.699
Well, it's not
like drinking

10:31.732 --> 10:33.333
too much liquid's
gonna kill anybody.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.036
Actually, that's
exactly what it can do.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.707
All of this scare mongering
over dehydration has created

10:39.740 --> 10:42.910
an entirely different problem:
overhydration.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.380
Phooey, you drink hard,
you pee hard.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.349
Not if you're exercising.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.184
Exercise stops you
from peeing

10:51.218 --> 10:54.287
by putting your body
in water conservation mode.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.023
And if you overhydrate then,

10:56.056 --> 10:58.258
all that extra fluid
has nowhere to go.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.861
Holy crow!

11:00.894 --> 11:03.731
It's called exercise
associated hyponatremia,

11:03.764 --> 11:05.799
and it can be deadly.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.435
In a study of
the 2002 Boston Marathon,

11:08.468 --> 11:10.838
nearly one-sixth
of the runners studied

11:10.871 --> 11:13.040
were found to have
hyponatremia.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.208
These runners drank so much
liquid during the race,

11:15.242 --> 11:18.345
that by the finish line,
they had actually gained weight.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.914
And she wins
by a belly!

11:20.948 --> 11:23.050
Okay, now, that's a joke,

11:23.083 --> 11:25.819
but this is a serious
problem in sports.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.890
At least 12 athletes have
died from overhydration.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.092
No, that's terrible.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.795
It's true.
Overhydration is dangerous.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.930
Most researchers,
including myself,

11:36.964 --> 11:39.900
think that it's the marketing
of the beverage industry

11:39.933 --> 11:41.969
that's responsibility
for this surge

11:42.002 --> 11:44.137
in fluid overload
hyponatremia.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.807
So, I've been putting
the kids in danger?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.308
No, Patty,

11:48.341 --> 11:51.111
death by hyponatremia
is extremely rare.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.246
Just give the kids
free access to water.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.882
Let 'em drink
when they're thirsty,

11:54.915 --> 11:57.918
and don't treat
these ads as science.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.254
I don't deserve
to wear this uniform.
(sobbing)

12:01.288 --> 12:03.824
Hey!
You made my Patty cry.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.426
Kids, let's practice
some tackling drills.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.295
I've got just the dummy.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.097
See ya, Adam.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.799
Maybe now's a good time
to talk about the whole

12:11.832 --> 12:13.433
concussion issue.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.836
I knew he was gonna
talk about concussions.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.471
Go, Blue Skins,
murderize that human tofu ball!

12:18.505 --> 12:20.273
(Adam)
Ah! No, wait!

12:20.307 --> 12:22.409
The truth about concussions
is really interesting!

12:25.846 --> 12:27.180
(birds chirping)
(Adam)
Aah!

12:27.214 --> 12:28.548
(kids screaming)

12:28.581 --> 12:30.784
Aah! No, no, no!

12:30.818 --> 12:33.220
No, kids, no, my skull hasn't
completely fused yet!

12:33.253 --> 12:34.822
Aah! Uhh!

12:34.855 --> 12:36.256
Oh, oh...

12:36.289 --> 12:37.925
I forgot,
kids can't hurt me.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.093
I always forget
I'm an adult.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.362
But not everyone
is so lucky.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.431
Because the truth is,
brain injuries in the NFL--

12:44.464 --> 12:46.366
Hey, before you
get started, okay,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.568
we know plenty
about concussions.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.470
They talk about it
on "Sports Center."

12:50.503 --> 12:53.173
They made that Will Smith movie
I slept through,

12:53.206 --> 12:55.508
and they've instituted
all these new rules.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.446
The NFL is on it,
problem solved!

12:59.479 --> 13:01.982
Problem not solved,
because the truth is

13:02.015 --> 13:03.583
everything you know
about football

13:03.616 --> 13:06.153
and brain injuries
is wrong-- ugh!

13:06.186 --> 13:08.989
(sports commentator)
Ooh, that's gotta hurt!
That could be a concussion.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.323
(commentator two)
Let's watch it again
from Sky Cam.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.059
(Adam)
Ahh!

13:12.092 --> 13:13.160
(commentator two)
And he's being taken
out of the game

13:13.193 --> 13:14.828
thanks to that
new rule.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.463
Good job, NFL,
you solved the problem,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.531
nothin' more
to see here.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.468
And no more fussin'
'bout concussin'.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.871
Actually,
let's keep fussin'.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.039
'Cause there's still
a ton of concussin'.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.909
♪♪

13:28.942 --> 13:31.511
Hey, see, Pats,
look, we're on TV.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.513
Hey, Murph!

13:33.546 --> 13:35.615
Oh, where is that
Stephen A. Smith?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.318
I've always wanted
to kick his ass.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.553
The NFL claims to take
concussions seriously.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.490
But the rate of diagnosed
concussions keeps rising,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.026
and those are just
the ones we know about.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.995
The truth is,
our national conversation

13:48.028 --> 13:49.462
about brain injuries
in football

13:49.496 --> 13:51.198
misses the point entirely,

13:51.231 --> 13:54.567
because concussions are
just the tip of the iceberg.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.069
Huh, what's happening?

13:56.103 --> 13:58.071
Oh, I changed the prompter,
just go with it.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.340
The brain disorder found
in football players is called

14:00.373 --> 14:03.176
Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy or CTE,

14:03.210 --> 14:04.878
and here's the hard truth.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.881
It's not just caused
by concussion-- wait, really?

14:07.915 --> 14:08.882
Yes, really.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.551
It's also caused
by the tiny run-of-the-mill hits

14:11.584 --> 14:13.954
that happen dozens
of times a game.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.189
Plays like this one.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.325
Ooh, that was unremarkable.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.393
This one...

14:20.427 --> 14:22.595
Booyah!
Those are common.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.065
Or even this one...

14:25.098 --> 14:29.202
Howzah! I'm snorin'
because that was boring.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.672
Exactly, these are totally
routine tackles and plays

14:32.705 --> 14:34.674
that happen
over and over again

14:34.707 --> 14:37.945
in every game,
especially to linemen.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.114
But research now shows that
even little hits like these

14:41.148 --> 14:44.384
cause CTE, which can lead
to lifelong memory loss,

14:44.417 --> 14:45.652
depression, aggression,

14:45.685 --> 14:48.688
dementia, anxiety,
and even suicide.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.323
Hold up, hot shot.

14:50.357 --> 14:54.094
How do tiny little baby hits
like that cause dementia?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.063
Good question-- let's go
to the premier expert

14:56.096 --> 14:58.098
in this field,
Dr. Ann McKee,

14:58.131 --> 14:59.632
Professor of Neurology
at Boston University

14:59.666 --> 15:02.002
and Director
of the CTE Center.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.236
Thanks for
joining us, Ann.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.571
Thanks, Adam.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.973
Unfortunately, it's true.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.141
CTE isn't just caused
by concussions.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.477
It's also caused by the small
sub-concussive hits

15:10.510 --> 15:11.711
that build up over time.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.114
If you play football
at any level,

15:14.147 --> 15:17.284
the chronic hits to the head
will cause brain damage.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.452
Well, that's easy,
why don't they just
build better helmets?

15:19.486 --> 15:21.254
That will never work.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.123
When the body
and head suddenly stop,

15:23.156 --> 15:25.425
the brain stretches, breaking
its internal structures.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.594
Unless you can fit
a helmet inside your skull,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.462
there is no way to stop it.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.299
Yeah, but that can't happen
to, like, everyone, right?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.167
(Ann)
Unfortunately, it does, Ray.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.303
We found CTE in over 96%

15:36.336 --> 15:39.172
of former professional players'
brains that we've studied.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.673
96%?
Oh, no.

15:40.707 --> 15:44.677
Ooh, that is
regretful and upsetful.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.479
The fact is,
our research shows

15:46.513 --> 15:49.149
that it's practically
impossible to play football

15:49.182 --> 15:51.651
without suffering
irreversible brain damage.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.620
And the NFL
knows about this?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.189
They do, in fact
the NFL has admitted

15:56.223 --> 15:59.026
that playing football
is linked to CTE.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.061
They just don't
take it seriously.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.030
When asked whether
football was dangerous,

16:03.063 --> 16:04.697
NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell said...

16:04.731 --> 16:06.033
There's risk in life.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.700
There's risk to sitting
on the couch.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.037
I don't know about you,
but if my couch was

16:10.070 --> 16:12.739
giving brain damage to 96%
of the people that sat on it,

16:12.772 --> 16:14.474
I would throw out
that couch.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.076
But, hey,
I guess it's easy

16:16.109 --> 16:17.744
to ignore the truth
when you're getting paid

16:17.777 --> 16:20.647
34 million bucks a year
to protect the status quo.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.016
Well, the players
are millionaires, too.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.352
I'd take that risk
for that kind of cash.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.420
Oh, yeah, NFL players can
make their own decisions.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.521
They're adults.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.358
But you know who can't?
Kids.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.393
Oh, crap, children.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.262
I forgot about
the children.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.664
There are less than
2,000 current NFL players,

16:37.697 --> 16:41.034
but more than 1 million high
school students play the game,

16:41.068 --> 16:44.337
as well as hundreds of thousands
of straight-up kids.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.140
And, well, I'll let
Dr. McKee tell you the rest.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.343
Children's brains are especially
susceptible to brain damage.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.180
The truth is the brain
isn't even finished developing

16:53.213 --> 16:55.048
until age 25.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.683
It's difficult
to say this,

16:56.716 --> 17:00.187
but children simply should not
be allowed to play football.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.122
Isn't that
a little overboard?

17:02.155 --> 17:03.456
Well, why don't you
ask the players?

17:03.490 --> 17:06.259
If I had a ten-year-old boy,
I don't know that I'd be

17:06.293 --> 17:09.062
real inclined to encourage him
to go play football.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.564
If you had
an eight-year-old kid now...

17:11.598 --> 17:13.666
would you tell him you'd
want him to play football?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.202
I wouldn't.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.104
And my whole life was football.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.606
Especially me, knowing
what I know now, there--

17:19.639 --> 17:21.708
there's absolutely no way,

17:21.741 --> 17:24.377
no way in hell that I would
do it all over again.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.080
Harry Carson?

17:27.114 --> 17:29.782
But he won the Super Bowl
with the Giants in '86.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.085
He would
take that all back?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.554
Look, it's hard to hear
that the game we love

17:34.587 --> 17:37.390
is killing people
and hurting kids.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.491
But it's true.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.628
Oh, my God, the kids,
the Blue Skins.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.330
I had them run
tackling drills.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.165
Adam, get us out of here!
We gotta stop them!

17:45.198 --> 17:46.166
Right.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.602
No, no, no!

17:49.636 --> 17:51.738
(sound slowed)
Noooo!

17:51.771 --> 17:55.342
We'll be
right baaaack!

18:00.280 --> 18:01.881
No! No, no, no.
No, no, no!

18:01.914 --> 18:04.184
Ah, whoof.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.119
Thank God
they're so bad at football.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.621
All right, everybody stop.
Take a knee, Blue Skins.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.257
(Patty)
Come on.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.292
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

18:12.325 --> 18:14.361
but we all gotta stop
playing football.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.729
It's dangerous,
and there's no way to stop it.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.432
Ray,
there's another way.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.335
It's true, if we keep playing
football the same old way,

18:22.369 --> 18:23.803
players will keep dying,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.605
parents will pull
the next generation

18:25.638 --> 18:27.340
of athletes
out of the sport,

18:27.374 --> 18:30.177
and the game we love will
slowly fade from prominence

18:30.210 --> 18:32.312
just like boxing
and horse racing did.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.214
We used to feel
five feet tall.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.350
But now
we're minced meat.
(bell dings)

18:37.384 --> 18:39.286
Tastes do change.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.553
But they don't have to.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.556
We can save football
by changing it.

18:43.590 --> 18:47.327
Like how? You just said almost
all hits cause brain damage.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.862
So, what, we ban tackling
and get rid of linemen?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.331
I mean, yes,
that would work.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.799
But that wouldn't
be football.

18:52.832 --> 18:56.203
Yeah, that's exactly what
they said back in 1905.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.337
(Adam)
Back then, the sport
was so violent

18:57.370 --> 19:00.373
that college players were
getting trampled to death.

19:00.407 --> 19:03.310
There were 18 deaths
nationwide that year alone.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.312
Yes, the sports
was far too brutal

19:05.345 --> 19:07.314
even for me,
Teddy Roosevelt!

19:07.347 --> 19:09.516
(birds screeches)
Ooh!

19:09.549 --> 19:11.684
That's why I insisted
football legalize

19:11.718 --> 19:13.220
a forward pass.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.389
It made the game safer
by opening up the field.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.791
Yes, that made the game
fundamentally different forever,

19:18.825 --> 19:21.561
but it was still football.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.464
(bird squawks, thud)
Ooh!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.832
Ha ha!

19:25.865 --> 19:27.367
I don't know,
that seems hard.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.601
Well, we have a choice.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.902
We could either
do the hard thing

19:29.936 --> 19:31.538
and make real changes
to the game,

19:31.571 --> 19:33.373
or we can keep
ignoring the problem,

19:33.406 --> 19:36.443
and 50 years from now
football will be dead.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.511
And that would be a shame
because football is awesome.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.812

that's killing people

19:49.422 --> 19:52.459

we have no power over?
