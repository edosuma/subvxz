00:58.658 --> 00:59.891
Toss'em and bag'em.

01:03.696 --> 01:04.563
Enjoy.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.042
It's good.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.077
Not great.

01:20.964 --> 01:24.516
But seeing that you are a
business man, Mr. Santiago.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.051
Captain.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.753
Captain.

01:29.806 --> 01:34.893
My associates and I are willing
to negotiate, a reasonable price.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.428
Let's say, 100,000.

01:43.119 --> 01:46.038
One million for the entire take,

01:46.539 --> 01:48.373
Not a penny less.

01:48.941 --> 01:52.961
A steep price for a small catch.

01:53.046 --> 01:58.500
A pod of 20,000 sharks are
migrating in this direction.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.669
When we're through with it,

02:02.005 --> 02:05.457
One million will look like a bargain.

02:09.262 --> 02:09.961
500.

02:16.820 --> 02:21.806
If you're looking to negotiate, Mr.
Palmer, look for the insurance salesman.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.944
I do believe we have a deal.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.987
All hands on deck.
All hands on deck.

02:36.539 --> 02:38.207
Tie the sails!

02:38.291 --> 02:40.092
Get the fins to the gally!

02:41.044 --> 02:43.212
Captain there is a north wind
hitting us fast!

02:43.296 --> 02:44.496
You need to get up here.

02:44.547 --> 02:47.633
I think this is for you captain.
The deposit.

02:47.684 --> 02:49.501
You'll receive the rest when we dock.

02:55.558 --> 02:57.643
You know the most important
thing I learned out here?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.814
We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.986
They should be the ones to be afraid of us.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.490
Salud.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.715
What the hell is that?

03:19.799 --> 03:23.302
They're called waves. They do
that from time to time.

03:33.396 --> 03:36.181
The storm is too strong. We are
going to have to go around it.

03:36.232 --> 03:39.384
Make it happen. I'm going to
down below.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.742
Captain!

04:41.947 --> 04:45.300
Change of plans Captain. I'm
going to take the money, your

04:45.385 --> 04:47.252
cargo, and what's left of the ship.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.137
Aah!

04:51.057 --> 04:52.290
I don't think so.

05:41.024 --> 05:43.007
Crazy waves out there today.

05:45.611 --> 05:46.812
Something unnatural about it.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.513
There's nothing unnatural about
everything.

05:57.874 --> 05:58.907
Lots of scenery today.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.025
I'm gonna focus on the waves.

06:36.245 --> 06:37.829
You better hurry mate. The
clouds are coming in.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.953
Whoo! Reminds me of the
nationals back in 04. Remember?

06:45.037 --> 06:48.757
You totally ripped that bugger. I thought
you were going to be rag dolled for sure.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.093
You know we really don't talk
like that, right?

06:51.177 --> 06:52.594
You doing a ride-out or not?

06:52.678 --> 06:54.045
Sure. Thanks.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.389
It's totally cooking out here mate.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.942
You're not kidding. It's a Mexican
hurricane. Bad for them good for us.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.092
Isn't that a drink?

07:08.144 --> 07:11.363
Hit. Hit!
Whoo!

07:15.935 --> 07:18.603
<i>Good Morning California</i>
<i>this is Jonni Waves. That's Jonni with</i>

07:18.654 --> 07:23.325
<i>with an "I". You may have noticed this</i>
<i>morning the unusul weather here in southern</i>

07:23.409 --> 07:28.279
<i>California. The clouds coming n over the ocean</i>
<i>and the large waves are proving difficult</i>

07:28.331 --> 07:33.785
<i>for surfers. I'm here in Santa Monica with</i>
<i>some breaking news about Hurricane David.</i>

07:33.836 --> 07:38.557
<i>It's been pounding the west coast of Mexico.</i>
<i>Pushing it's way up to the coast to the</i>

07:38.624 --> 07:42.861

<i>driving a very dangerous surf.</i>

07:42.929 --> 07:46.014
No kidding. Fin's out there.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.267
Yeah but I won't worry about fin,
I mean he's the best surfer I've ever seen.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.938
Except for me of course.
In my prime.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.906
When was that George?
The civil war?

07:55.274 --> 07:57.943
Eh, I'm not that old. You know I
got some movies babe...

07:57.994 --> 08:02.664
Hey! What did I tell you? You can touch
everything at this bar except for me.

08:03.315 --> 08:05.834
- Hey! Come on!
- Oopsies! Looks like you need another drink

08:06.285 --> 08:09.287
Yeah I need one. One on the house.
One that doesn't coast me any money.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.391
How come you never talk about that scar?

08:13.459 --> 08:14.676
There's nothing to talk about.

08:15.127 --> 08:15.827
I cut myself shaving.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.880
4 bucks.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.883
4 Bucks? I thought it was on the
house. You spilled the last one.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.552
<i>Perhaps the silver</i>
<i>lining in this is that the storm</i>

08:23.636 --> 08:27.338
<i>driven away the inflex of</i>
<i>sharks out of the area...</i>

08:27.390 --> 08:32.611
Yeah I hope it does. Hope it does. I hope
the storm kills'em. I hope it kills them all.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.511
Me too. You have no idea.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.664
Tired already?

09:25.731 --> 09:27.732
What's the last time you short
boarded, old timer?

09:29.168 --> 09:32.203
I never stopped. I just like
this one rides.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.204
Yeah. Whatever.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.346
Alright grandpa. Ima show you
how it's done.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.132
Grandpa?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.754
Show her how it's done, Grandpa!

10:04.537 --> 10:06.404
Come on. Oh!

10:13.779 --> 10:15.196
Deanna there's a shark!

10:24.156 --> 10:25.340
Hey get outta the water!

11:18.811 --> 11:19.844
SHARKS!

11:21.747 --> 11:23.481
Hey Get out of the water!
Sharks! They're coming in!

11:27.720 --> 11:28.820
Get off the beach!

11:33.576 --> 11:35.160
Get out of the water!
Sharks! Get out of the water!

11:50.009 --> 11:52.043
SHARKS!
Everyone out of the water now!

11:54.513 --> 11:56.314
Everyone out of
the water now! We're evacuating

11:56.382 --> 12:01.269
the beach. Everybody off
the beach immediately.

12:01.353 --> 12:02.771
Aaah!

12:25.961 --> 12:27.412
Come here you bloody shark! Come
here!

12:45.765 --> 12:46.631
Aaah!

12:48.234 --> 12:48.966
Baz!

12:52.571 --> 12:53.104
Baz!

12:59.411 --> 13:01.029
Aaah!

13:05.534 --> 13:07.001
Just hang on. I'll let you in.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.349
These sharks of your have no etiquette.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.383
Etiquette?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.803
I thought you were Australian not British.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.504
Tasmanian buddy.

13:27.356 --> 13:28.606
Just hang on, I'll get you in.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.541
What were you thinking? You
could have been killed.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.024
I'm fine.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.159
Aah!

13:48.210 --> 13:49.961
We need a tourniquet.

13:50.546 --> 13:51.412
Here use this.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.302
It's just a - aah!
- Little nibble.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.206
Aah!

14:02.758 --> 14:04.092
Are you ok? Are you sure?

14:04.176 --> 14:05.894
He must have wanted a snack.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.879
Sharks don't like vegemite.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.681
It's not funny.
Aah.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.056
Hey. You gonna be ok?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.276
Yeah. I'm fine.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.623
Hey can I get some of those
tasty nuts. Thank you.

14:35.708 --> 14:41.012
And then. Are you listening? The shark opens it's mouth.
Goes to swallow fin whole but Fin

14:41.079 --> 14:43.581
Looks at the shark - Do the
look.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.917
No, do the look.

14:47.937 --> 14:48.803
Oh my god.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.973
Yeah that one. And the shark
goes, 'You know what?'

14:52.057 --> 14:55.226
I'm pissing off. I'm not gonna
mess with the surf champion.

14:55.277 --> 14:58.696
Surf legend. Finley the Fin Shepard.
Ain't that right?

14:58.864 --> 14:59.731
On you mate.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.735
I don't believe it. You guys are
nuts.

15:03.786 --> 15:04.369
Look.

15:05.871 --> 15:06.788
Do you see that?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.239
- Oh yeah.
- It's a little nibble.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.792
So he gives him a look and you
give him a nibble -

15:10.876 --> 15:12.610
No, HE gave me a nibble.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.798
I don't know. Are you guys going back
out there and do any swimming?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.501
With the sharks?

15:22.054 --> 15:23.421
It's a storm.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.424
It's what's driven them all up north.
Eventually they'll go back from they came from.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.344
I hope. But the were knocking.

15:29.428 --> 15:33.348
Yeah knock knock knocking on your door.
And i have never seen so many and so bold.

15:33.649 --> 15:36.133
It's just a storm. Just gotta stay out of
the water for a couple days that's all.

15:38.637 --> 15:39.570
Just a storm?

15:40.823 --> 15:41.906
Looks like a hurricane.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.242
I'm just happy you're ok.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.860
Hey hey, what are you doing?

15:46.662 --> 15:47.979
What? Do you think you're too
old for me?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.580
No, I'm your boss.

15:49.648 --> 15:50.815
So?

15:50.866 --> 15:52.700
So? Go get back to work.

15:55.004 --> 15:56.454
Hey! I'm not too old for ya.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.206
I don't think.

15:59.174 --> 16:00.041
I'm not your boss.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.516
Daddy issues. Hey! I'm not
judging you darlin'.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.635
Ouch!

16:10.686 --> 16:11.970

16:13.105 --> 16:14.439
- Here to issues.
- Yeah!

16:17.109 --> 16:17.942
Who's is this?

16:21.196 --> 16:24.282
<i>Hurricane David is</i>
<i>poised to be the 1st hurricane to hit</i>

16:24.349 --> 16:30.038
<i>the state of California. And it is now</i>
<i>barreling to the Santa Monica shorelines.</i>

16:30.122 --> 16:35.209
<i>We have suffered tropical stors in the past but</i>
<i>we have never been hit by a storm quite like</i>

16:35.294 --> 16:40.915
<i>this. Wide spread flooding is expected</i>
<i>and experts are saying global warming</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:44.201
<i>is the reason for this</i>
<i>unprecedented event. We will</i>

16:44.253 --> 16:47.088
<i>be back with more news as it develops.</i>

16:59.802 --> 17:01.019
Hello. Wexler residence.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.286
April it's Fin.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.588
Yeah Fin I know your voice. What
do you want?

17:03.655 --> 17:05.022
Look I'm just calling to make sure-

17:05.089 --> 17:07.892
When did you go back to using
Wexler again?

17:08.944 --> 17:09.861
<i>cause that's my name.</i>

17:09.928 --> 17:12.096
Look Fin I'm really busy.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.932
Just calling to make sure you
and Claudia are ok.

17:14.983 --> 17:16.901
There's a bad hurricane rolling
in and I want-

17:16.969 --> 17:18.368
<i>Is this about money?</i>

17:18.436 --> 17:19.704
Because if this is about money
Fin, I told you already that-

17:19.771 --> 17:22.040
It's the storm. I just want to
make sure guys are ok.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.409
Of course we're ok. It's barely
even raining.

17:26.494 --> 17:30.448
Look, it's really sweet that you are calling in to
check in on us but Collin already checked the

17:30.499 --> 17:32.850
drains and, we're gonna be fine.
They're cleared out.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.971
Well it's flooding here and not
the plumbing. The ocean.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.756
I think you guys should get out of town.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.726
What are you talking about? We
are 100 miles from the ocean.

17:41.793 --> 17:46.797
You are exactly 6.6 miles from the ocean.
And on a day like today it's not far enough.

17:46.849 --> 17:48.649
I'm gonna take you and Claudia
further inland.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.184
And what about Collin?

17:50.269 --> 17:52.353
You know you are not the only
one that can keep us safe.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.205
We're not going anywhere.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.824
Fine. Then let me just get Claudia.
We'll it my week for the month.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.159
Is that what this is about?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.144
No!

18:00.195 --> 18:03.364
Look you are gonna see her on the 20th
like you always do. I gotta go ok. Bye Fin.

18:05.367 --> 18:06.200
Who's that?

18:07.119 --> 18:07.869
My wife.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.007
That is his wife.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.293
- Yeah his wife.
- Shut up Baz.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.722
Already everybody, listen up.
I'm closing the restaurant.

18:28.724 --> 18:31.526
Storm is coming and it's coming
fast. Get home safe everybody.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.479
Don't forget taco Tuesdays.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.114
George, you got to get out of here.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.565
What's going on?

18:37.649 --> 18:39.383
If I don't secure the bar, I'm
going to loose everything.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.235
Come on George, George wake up.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.788
Oh! I hear an angel, I must be
in heaven.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.689
George you better wake up or I'm
calling in your bar tab.

18:45.741 --> 18:47.358
Oh, i'm up I'm up.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.835
Hey hey, you need to go home.

18:57.886 --> 18:58.719
I'm not going anywhere.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.755
This is not your problem.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.974
No! It is my problem. Because if this bar
get blown over then I'm out of a job too.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.309
Yeah, and I'm not gonna have any
place to drink.

19:05.377 --> 19:06.427
Can't argue with that one.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.675
For an environmentalist you sure
do hate sharks.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.345
I've got fire power behind the
bar. Come on come on!

19:44.383 --> 19:46.417
Alright, grab a weapon. Grab anything
you can find to defend yourself.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.353
Give me something dangerous.,

19:49.972 --> 19:51.755
Can I get one for the road Fin?

19:51.807 --> 19:52.807
Huh? What?

19:55.561 --> 19:56.694
Come on let's go let's go let's go!

19:56.761 --> 19:58.429
George get your ass up!

19:58.480 --> 19:59.030
Now!

19:59.097 --> 19:59.981
Alright.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.153
Come on kid.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.307
Don't you ever make fun of my
stool again.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.344
Come on come on.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.885
That's what you get for trying to eat me.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.017
Come on come on guys let's go.

21:44.469 --> 21:49.807
<i>We are here live at the Santa Monica Pier,</i>
<i>this is what remains after</i>

21:49.874 --> 21:55.262
<i>the massive storm tore through the popular attraction.</i>
<i>The waves also brought in sharks</i>

21:55.347 --> 21:57.231
<i>which have injured dozens and</i>
<i>killed several people.</i>

22:17.419 --> 22:18.636
We'll rebuild mate.

22:19.705 --> 22:20.571
Insurance will cover it.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.911
L.A. wasn't built for all this water.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.965
I'm really worried about Claudia and April.
I really gotta go check on them.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.583
I'm coming with you.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.052
April doesn't like you, remember?

22:35.637 --> 22:39.023
Nah mate. She doesn't like you, remember?
She loves me. Where do you think Claudia came from?

22:39.090 --> 22:40.257
Who's Claudia?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.143
His daughter.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.963
You have an ex-wife and a daughter?

22:47.816 --> 22:49.099
I can drop you at home if you want?

22:50.369 --> 22:53.270
I live on the beach it's obviously flooded.
No where else to go.

22:57.159 --> 22:58.309
Looks like we're all refugees now.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.612
I wanna go with you.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.048
Make sure your family is ok.

23:10.455 --> 23:11.622
Anybody seen George?

23:12.474 --> 23:13.174
George?

23:19.097 --> 23:19.980
Here he is.

23:22.634 --> 23:26.187
Oh man. I'm glad you woke me up.
I was having the worst nightmare.

24:17.355 --> 24:19.089
Gosh the water is raising.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.242
Water is not going to be a problem.
All the electronics have been sealed with

24:21.326 --> 24:22.993
silicone. We'll be fine.

24:23.328 --> 24:25.579
I've driven this thing from here
to the beaches of Costa Rica.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.001
Why is the car shaking.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.556
What the hell. There are sharks
on the streets.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.225
These fish surely have a hankering for me.

24:41.596 --> 24:43.414
It's like one taste of Baz is
just isn't enough.

24:46.601 --> 24:48.052
Hey whoa whoa whoa.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.454
Hold up with the guns. We don't
need more blood in the water.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.926
That's a tiger shark.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.278
How do you know that?

24:57.362 --> 24:58.245
Shark Week.

25:01.867 --> 25:02.666
Were'd it go?

25:04.736 --> 25:05.703
Where did it go?

25:09.424 --> 25:10.341
Ah geez.

25:10.876 --> 25:11.742
Hey

25:18.783 --> 25:19.583
It's under the car.

25:24.806 --> 25:25.890
Well can I start shooting now?

25:26.625 --> 25:27.558
Yea. Do it.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.230
We got to get to higher ground.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.599
Take the freeway. It's above street level.
You take the 10 to the 405. You're almost in

25:35.650 --> 25:40.988
Bevelry Hills. And there is no way
the ocean has washed inland that far.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.940
What makes you an expert on
Beverly Hills George?

25:43.274 --> 25:44.625
That's where I live.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.077
George if you live in Beverly Hills
why do you come all the way to the

25:47.128 --> 25:48.712
coast to come and drink at my bar?

25:48.780 --> 25:50.831
I don't know. I like the view,
you know.

25:50.916 --> 25:54.051
There's the beach. There's all these scantily
glad women there that pretend to like me if

25:54.118 --> 25:59.173
I buy them a drink. And there is my seat.
My chair. My chair is always there.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.008
Plus you don't charge 15 dollars a plock.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.292
Yeah.

26:03.628 --> 26:08.148
Plus there is the beautiful Nova there
who I am planning to marry soon.

26:08.233 --> 26:14.071
I sit around and think about it every
night and day. Everywhere I go.

26:27.202 --> 26:28.168
Hey!

26:30.505 --> 26:31.505
Bloody hell.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.177
That's the 405.

26:38.162 --> 26:39.046
I hate the 405.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.183
Bloody hell. What are these
idiots doing?

26:44.052 --> 26:45.302
Yeah I'll just go around them.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.337
You need to back up. I need to
get out of here!

26:47.389 --> 26:49.506
Get back in your car. It's not
safe out here.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.442
It's just a little water.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.011
Typical Californians are afraid of the rain.

26:54.562 --> 26:55.362
Yeah.

26:57.816 --> 26:58.232
Stop!

27:02.570 --> 27:03.387
Watch it will ya.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.380
Maybe they're not such idiots after all.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.465
Oh my god.

27:17.335 --> 27:18.836
It's like old faithful.

27:19.370 --> 27:20.804
We're gonna need faith to get
through that.

27:20.872 --> 27:21.972
The water is raising behind us.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.378
What what what?

27:31.933 --> 27:33.216
Oh my god!

27:34.019 --> 27:35.986
I just can't sit back and watch this.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.405
- What?
- The sharks are swimming right at them.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.025
They're not gonna make it.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.192
Don't even think about it.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.694
They're not gonna make it.

27:44.112 --> 27:47.264
Fin! Where you going?
The sharks are falling from the freakin sky.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.950
Here we go again.

27:50.401 --> 27:51.235
Nova!

27:55.256 --> 27:57.758
There's sharks out there. You
don't have to go out there.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.461
There's absolutely no reason to
go out there.

28:10.254 --> 28:11.939
Everyone needs to get to higher ground!

28:16.311 --> 28:17.194
Puppy!

28:17.779 --> 28:20.430
Somebody help me! Help me get my
dog out!

28:28.073 --> 28:29.957
Please help me! My dog is locked
inside.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.775
This area is flooding.

28:31.826 --> 28:32.826
Come on, get out!

28:36.114 --> 28:37.414
Please!

28:39.617 --> 28:41.001
Please help!

29:05.693 --> 29:06.777
Somebody help!

29:06.828 --> 29:08.278
Ok. You go!

29:12.834 --> 29:16.003
Ok. I got you princess come on.
There you go.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.761
Come on George.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.549
George! Come on George!

29:31.853 --> 29:33.336
Oh Crap!

29:35.723 --> 29:37.057
Ouch! Get off of me!

29:46.234 --> 29:47.317
It's not gonna end.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.321
The flood channels, the storm
drains, the sewers.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.823
It's not gonna stop at the coast.

29:54.659 --> 29:55.709
They're going to swim everywhere.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.378
Come on get in the car.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.595
We've got to go through this.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.480
What?

30:16.547 --> 30:18.215
You've got kangaroos loose in the
brain mate. We can't go through that.

30:18.266 --> 30:20.484
The aerodynamics in this car
cannot match the waves.

30:20.551 --> 30:23.187
The waves are only gonna get
bigger as the storm get closer.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.889
Trust me, if there is one thing
I know, it's timing waves.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.241
That's what I was afraid of.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.492
They come in sets of 3.

30:30.195 --> 30:30.894
One.

30:33.198 --> 30:33.780
Two.

30:36.334 --> 30:36.950
Three.

30:50.465 --> 30:50.964
Whoo.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.352
Are you ok?

30:56.387 --> 30:58.438
I'm alright. 10 fingers. 10
Toes.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.457
Uh, gotta love LA.

31:18.326 --> 31:19.326
What are these people thinking?

31:19.878 --> 31:20.661
Nothing.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.255
Does April know you coming?

31:31.756 --> 31:32.589
No.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.458
But at least we'll be in the
hills away from the flooding.

31:37.762 --> 31:38.295
Alright.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.517
It's awfully nice of you to let her
new boyfriend stay in your house.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.467
Don't remind me.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.095
Unbelievable.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.553
We're almost at the house.

32:20.221 --> 32:22.723
That's too bad. I was hoping it
was further up the hill.

32:44.078 --> 32:44.861
April!

32:45.463 --> 32:46.196
April!

32:50.251 --> 32:51.668
Hey let us in.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.904
Whoa! What are you doing here?
And what happened to him?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.172
Nothing. Your Fin save my
life.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.758
He's not my Fin anymore.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.242
And who is she?

32:59.310 --> 33:00.894
It's Nova. She works at the bar.
Now will you let us in.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.313
No! I told you not to come.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.851
No! Just go away. Take your
stupid friend and Baz and leave.

33:14.158 --> 33:14.992
Nice Shot.

33:15.943 --> 33:17.828
By the way I'm not a stripper.

33:17.895 --> 33:18.695
Claudia!

33:18.763 --> 33:19.746
She doesn't want to talk to you.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.831
Claudia!

33:22.166 --> 33:24.001
Dad? What are you doing here?

33:24.068 --> 33:26.403
There's a big storm coming in.
It's not safe here.

33:26.454 --> 33:28.538
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Just leave.

33:28.589 --> 33:29.873
I didn't come here to argue with you.
I came here to get you.

33:29.924 --> 33:30.974
I don't care.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.592
What is all the ruckus?

33:35.747 --> 33:37.297
Awe Sheppard.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.049
Should have figured it was you.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.601
What are you doing here?

33:41.686 --> 33:43.387
L.A. is drowning.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.889
I'm going inland. I'm taking my
family with me.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.358
Finley. April is mine.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.093
Excuse me?

33:50.144 --> 33:52.979
My girlfriend is not your responsibility.

33:53.064 --> 33:57.401
And unless it's the 20th of the month,
which currently it's not. Neither is Claudia.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.404
Collin, don't be rude. He's just
worried about us.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.075
Every time it rains in L.A. everyone
swears it's the storm of the century.

34:05.126 --> 34:09.629
And even if it is, Beverly Hills
emergency services a second to none.

34:11.282 --> 34:12.949
We're safe here.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.252
There are sharks flooding the streets.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.759
And there is now one swimming in
your pool.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.228
Are you kidding?

34:26.130 --> 34:29.516
Shark in the swimming pool is impossible.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.600
Collin!

34:49.337 --> 34:51.204
Something is on my foot! I can't
move!

34:51.289 --> 34:53.172
Finley Help me! Finley!

34:53.257 --> 34:53.989
Watch out!

34:58.012 --> 34:59.012
Collin!

34:59.097 --> 35:00.330
Help me! It's getting away!

35:01.099 --> 35:01.932
Collin!

35:02.833 --> 35:03.717
I've got your back.

35:04.552 --> 35:05.435
Get it's nose.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.176
Die already!

35:18.316 --> 35:19.399
It's coming back!

35:19.484 --> 35:20.350
- No!
- Oh my gosh!

35:21.319 --> 35:22.152
Fin!

35:23.321 --> 35:23.853
Ready?

35:58.156 --> 35:58.888
Fin!

36:01.192 --> 36:01.992
Where'd it go?

36:03.277 --> 36:04.661
Where's it go?

36:04.728 --> 36:07.197
- Go go go!
- Oh my gosh!

36:29.437 --> 36:30.920
Fin hurry up, Get over here.

36:34.892 --> 36:35.809
Nice shot.

36:35.893 --> 36:36.860
Thanks.

36:37.979 --> 36:39.529
Looks like it's that time of the month.

36:45.570 --> 36:46.453
Look!

36:54.245 --> 36:55.161
We're out of Ammo.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.998
The eye of the storm still
hasn't come to shore yet.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.585
It's gonna get worse before it gets any better.
We got to get inland and we got to get

37:01.636 --> 37:02.969
some place safe for all of us.

37:03.054 --> 37:03.786
Where?

37:04.889 --> 37:05.805
I'm thinking the desert.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.475
No, we have to go to Van Nuys to get Matt.

37:09.176 --> 37:10.860
Matt's in flight school there.

37:11.312 --> 37:14.431
Matt's at flight school? I thought he was
vacationing at Tampa with his buddies.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.484
When did this happen? I just
talked to him.

37:18.135 --> 37:21.655
How come no body tells me these things.
I'm suppose to be included in these conversations.

37:21.989 --> 37:26.343
He wanted to tell you but, Collin said
it was none of your business anymore.

37:26.744 --> 37:27.694
Who's Matt?

37:28.312 --> 37:29.496
My brother.

37:30.114 --> 37:31.281
You have a son too?

37:33.417 --> 37:34.034
Alright.

37:36.871 --> 37:38.338
We got to get out of here quick.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.156
How are we going to do that?

37:42.826 --> 37:44.010
I'm going to push the shark out of here.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.382
I'm gonna distract it.

37:50.217 --> 37:52.102
When I do this, get to the car
as fast as you can.

37:56.807 --> 37:57.607
Now!

38:19.630 --> 38:20.463
He'll be ok.

38:20.915 --> 38:21.965
Fin!

38:22.032 --> 38:23.083
Fin!

38:28.539 --> 38:29.255
Come on, get in!

38:30.091 --> 38:31.207
Move it! Move your ass!

38:38.566 --> 38:40.550
Go Go Go!

39:09.764 --> 39:11.214
Easy come, easy go.

39:19.923 --> 39:22.525
<i>The eye of hurricane David is</i>
<i>continuing it's relentless</i>

39:22.593 --> 39:27.997
<i>pounding through the streets of Los Angeles.</i>
<i>And more surprisingly and most shocking</i>

39:28.065 --> 39:33.036
<i>reports have been pouring in from all over,</i>
<i>that sharks are washing ashore.</i>

39:33.103 --> 39:39.542
<i>Live sharks. And not just from the coastal</i>
<i>flooding but they are coming up through the drais</i>

39:44.281 --> 39:45.448
Do you always have this much
ammo in your jeep?

39:45.499 --> 39:46.949
Sepra Peratus.

39:47.001 --> 39:49.486
Dad, are you really saying that
right now. Can you be serious?

39:49.553 --> 39:50.854
It means?

39:50.921 --> 39:52.222
Always be prepared.

39:52.289 --> 39:54.057
Thank you.

39:54.341 --> 39:56.393
I always thought it would be an earthquake
that would be the end of Los Angeles.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.728
Or a meteor shower. Zombies
even.

39:58.796 --> 39:59.496
Yeah.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.731
Black Plague. Aliens.

40:01.799 --> 40:03.433
But sharks? Come on.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.401
Yeah.

40:05.135 --> 40:07.570
Yeah. Go figure. My luck,
sharks.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.072
Yeah your luck. Sharks.

40:10.974 --> 40:11.908
Mine too.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.699
I'm not gonna lie. It's kinda
hot when you do that.

40:23.370 --> 40:26.289
<i>Again we will keep</i>
<i>yo updated n this storm.</i>

40:26.357 --> 40:29.375
<i>This is Jonni Waves. That's</i>
<i>Jonni with an "I"-</i>

40:29.460 --> 40:30.877
Call Matt.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.516
<i>This is the emergency alert system.</i>
<i>National weather servie has issued a tornado warning</i>

40:36.600 --> 40:40.887
<i>through Los Angeles County. Water spouts have</i>
<i>been detected in the coastal water from Orane</i>

40:40.971 --> 40:42.806
No kidding. You are a bit late
on that one.

40:42.857 --> 40:43.773
We got to get out of here fast.

40:43.841 --> 40:45.041
We got to go get Matt.

40:45.092 --> 40:47.210
The freeways will be a nightmare.

40:47.261 --> 40:51.181
But there's a short cut if you turn right up here.
That's how I always get around the Hollywood

40:51.232 --> 40:52.232
traffic with my friends.

40:52.316 --> 40:53.900
What are you doing in Hollywood?

40:53.984 --> 40:55.935
Since when do you care?

40:57.438 --> 40:58.488
Hold on.

41:03.727 --> 41:04.911
The storm is dying down.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.162
How can you tell?

41:06.230 --> 41:07.730
Not as many sharks flying around.

41:17.708 --> 41:20.076
Why you stopping. We have to go
get Matt.

41:20.127 --> 41:22.595
Don't you see that? There could
be kids in there.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.632
There's no one in there. And
your kid is right here.

41:25.716 --> 41:29.085
We got to get her somewhere safe.
This is so typical of you Fin.

41:29.136 --> 41:31.938
You care more about other people
then you do your own family.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.022
Let's go!

41:36.260 --> 41:37.060
Please.

41:45.569 --> 41:46.653
I can't.

41:47.988 --> 41:51.040
The water is raising. I'm going to go
up on the bridge and rappel down.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.314
Fin this is crazy.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.870
Calm down guys. Calm down ok.

42:20.921 --> 42:23.206
There's other grown ups coming ok?

42:23.257 --> 42:27.210
Uh uh, Police Department, Fire Department.
They're going to get us out of this.

42:27.261 --> 42:30.430
As long as we stay in here we
are going to be fine, ok?

42:30.514 --> 42:33.583
Trust me. We're gonna be just
fine.

43:27.071 --> 43:27.970
Anybody in there?

43:30.574 --> 43:32.075
Whoa! Whoa! Be careful.

43:46.340 --> 43:47.090
Need a lift?

43:49.927 --> 43:51.010
I'm glad to see you.

43:54.331 --> 43:55.048
Send the rope.

44:02.356 --> 44:05.675
I reached dispatch right before all the electronics
went out. They said someone from 911

44:05.743 --> 44:06.859
is sending someone over.

44:06.944 --> 44:08.194
Oh yeah? Want to wait for them?

44:08.729 --> 44:09.529
Hell no!

44:09.613 --> 44:10.897
I didn't think so. Who's first?

44:11.115 --> 44:11.948
Ok, come over here honey.

44:16.954 --> 44:17.520
Ok.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.207
Alright Samantha you're going to
be alright.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.076
Start pulling, they are ready.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.411
Alright you ready? Just keep looking up.
It's gonna be fine Samantha.

44:25.879 --> 44:26.913
Here we go.

44:27.464 --> 44:28.498
Ok, Lift her up!

44:30.718 --> 44:32.502
Alright here we go Samantha
you're going to be alright.

44:33.003 --> 44:33.803
Go ahead.

44:33.870 --> 44:34.704
It's gonna be just like flying.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.012
Come on come on. Quicker, let's
go.

44:51.689 --> 44:52.438
Yes!

44:53.657 --> 44:54.857
Yes! Alright pull'em up!

44:56.243 --> 44:58.077
You're doing already. You're
doing good. Don't be afraid.

45:03.917 --> 45:04.951
Come on. Hold on tight.

45:05.035 --> 45:05.585
He's up.

45:05.669 --> 45:07.270
Alright.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.090
Alright, who's next?

45:19.600 --> 45:24.520
A bunch of little kids went up before me.
How hard can it be right?

45:24.588 --> 45:25.087
Let's go.

45:25.139 --> 45:25.938
Alright.

45:27.357 --> 45:30.193
Go over there. Come on sweetheart.
Your dad is trying to do good here.

45:30.260 --> 45:31.060
Give him a hand.

45:35.199 --> 45:37.483
Are you sure this thing is
strong enough to hold me?

45:37.568 --> 45:38.434
Nope I'm not.

45:38.485 --> 45:39.935
Great.

45:39.987 --> 45:40.703
I'm sure not looking forward
going in there after you.

45:40.771 --> 45:41.571
Yeah.

45:41.622 --> 45:44.774
I hate sharks. I'm from Wyoming.

45:45.075 --> 45:49.662
You know-
I moved down here to be an actor.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.164
Dad.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.623
I got to go up right now!
Please!

46:00.674 --> 46:01.957
Up up up!

46:02.009 --> 46:03.810
Come on!

46:03.894 --> 46:10.633
Oh god! 15 grand a year. No benefits.
Screaming kids.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.852
Call down. It's ok. Don't Panic.

46:12.936 --> 46:16.189
I use to hate heights. Now I'm
away from sharks.

46:29.953 --> 46:31.821
Ok let's do this now before I
become hot lunch.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.765
Watch out fin!

46:44.885 --> 46:48.387
Watch out to the right. Watch
out!

46:49.690 --> 46:51.190
Oh my gosh be careful.
Watch your foot.

46:51.508 --> 46:52.942
Hurry, keep going faster.

46:56.947 --> 46:59.398
Oh my gosh!

47:00.868 --> 47:01.701
Be careful!

47:02.686 --> 47:03.703
Be careful Fin!

47:04.371 --> 47:05.321
Watch out!

47:07.958 --> 47:10.576
Fin come on! Watch out Fin!

47:11.461 --> 47:12.962
I had just about enough of you.

47:19.636 --> 47:20.970
Be careful Fin!

47:22.890 --> 47:24.640
Come on.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.511
Your ok. Oh my gosh.

47:38.238 --> 47:39.388
Finny, look at the sky.

47:40.390 --> 47:42.225
The storm is clearing up. Maybe
it's done.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.026
Good.

47:44.311 --> 47:45.945
These guys are gonna get you home, ok?

47:46.029 --> 47:46.863
Be safe.

48:01.611 --> 48:02.444
Oh Crap.

48:03.497 --> 48:04.413
What?

48:12.622 --> 48:13.789
Claudia get in the Jeep!

48:14.457 --> 48:15.391
I'm fine mom.

48:18.178 --> 48:19.145
Get down! Get down!

48:44.838 --> 48:45.671
You alright?

48:56.300 --> 48:57.683
You ok?

48:57.768 --> 49:00.336
My mom always told me Hollywood
would kill me.

49:17.287 --> 49:18.237
Start the engine.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.207
Is that good?

49:22.376 --> 49:23.793
Ok rev it. Rev it.

49:25.462 --> 49:26.712
Guys it's flooding.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.697
It's gonna be easier if we steal
another car.

49:28.749 --> 49:30.082
Then steal another car.

49:30.167 --> 49:31.717
There's a small gas leak but it
should run for now.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.542
What is that?

49:41.895 --> 49:43.012
It's a water spout.

49:44.014 --> 49:47.216
Tornado over the ocean. Water
gets sucked up in the air...

49:54.191 --> 49:56.192
Are those sharks?

49:56.243 --> 49:57.559
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

49:57.611 --> 49:59.245
Close her up. Let's go.

50:23.804 --> 50:26.439
Well, at least the rain is easing up a bit.

50:33.230 --> 50:34.397
What was that?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.161
Oh my god. Oh my god.

50:49.246 --> 50:50.046
What the hell?

50:50.113 --> 50:51.113
Kill it!

50:57.220 --> 50:58.054
This is crazy!

51:03.593 --> 51:04.560
Hit the breaks!

51:05.562 --> 51:06.429
Get down Claudia!

51:21.278 --> 51:22.244
Bloody hell!

51:28.452 --> 51:29.485
Why did we stop?

51:30.203 --> 51:31.454
It must be flooded.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.872
Well fix it!

51:33.290 --> 51:34.590
Mate I smell gas.

51:34.657 --> 51:36.509
I do too. Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

51:38.095 --> 51:39.211
Go go go!

51:39.296 --> 51:40.162
The gun!

52:11.795 --> 52:12.962
Can I use you phone please?

52:13.029 --> 52:14.330
It's been dead for hours.

52:20.737 --> 52:21.754
Thanks.

52:22.472 --> 52:23.205
No problem.

52:24.224 --> 52:26.475
So what kinda name is Nova anyway?

52:26.543 --> 52:30.429
That's the kinda name you give yourself
when you don't like the person you use to be.

52:32.849 --> 52:37.736
Hey, uh. Look, I see the way you
took at my dad.

52:38.822 --> 52:41.357
He's just gonna break your heart
just like he did to my mom and I.

52:48.081 --> 52:49.498
It looks like the eye of the storm is over.

52:59.876 --> 53:00.709
Or maybe not.

53:02.912 --> 53:05.514
Hey make it quick. I don't want
to spend too much time here.

53:09.519 --> 53:13.088
<i>With these storms ravaging</i>
<i>the streets of Los Angeles, some religious</i>

53:17.394 --> 53:19.979
<i>Apocalypse my ass.</i>

53:20.063 --> 53:24.984
This isn't the end of the world. Gods not angry with us.
The Aliens are not coming down.

53:25.068 --> 53:26.652
It's the government.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.070
Ye-ah.

53:28.121 --> 53:31.607
With the big capital G. They're
behind everything.

53:31.658 --> 53:35.277
They know what we buy. They know what
we eat. Where we go to the bathroom.

53:35.328 --> 53:36.662
Hurry. Hurry.

53:36.746 --> 53:39.131
They know what kinda cheese I like.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.249
Pepper Jack.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.052
And the weather too.

53:43.887 --> 53:47.973
I gotta hand it to the, Sharks.
I never saw that coming.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.625
Y-eah.

53:50.143 --> 53:53.229
<i>Weather satellites</i>

53:53.296 --> 53:59.852

54:08.995 --> 54:10.279
Protein.

54:10.347 --> 54:12.114
I know how we're going to get out of here.

54:12.165 --> 54:13.415
You know we need a car first.

54:15.035 --> 54:15.951
I've got it covered.

54:20.991 --> 54:21.823
Oh nice!

54:42.112 --> 54:45.781
You're gonna need stiches and antibiotics.
And you're gonna have a hell of a scar.

54:45.848 --> 54:48.183
That's ok. Chicks dig scars,
right?

54:51.204 --> 54:52.488
Why you driving so fast?

54:52.956 --> 54:54.523
We got to get there fast before
they clear the accident.

54:54.574 --> 54:55.407
What accident?

54:55.492 --> 54:56.709
Something I saw on the news

54:58.878 --> 54:59.545
Look out!

54:59.629 --> 55:01.130
Whoa!

55:03.416 --> 55:04.383
This is nuts.

55:08.672 --> 55:10.306
Now we're never gonna get to Van Nuys.

55:10.373 --> 55:13.142
- Baz, Drive around it.
- I can't. It's blocked in every direction.

55:17.847 --> 55:19.932
We got to get Matt before the
storm picks up again.

55:21.685 --> 55:22.685
I'm going for it.

55:23.353 --> 55:25.237
- Are you crazy! Don't do it
- Go! Go! Go!

55:25.322 --> 55:27.489
Whoo!

55:29.392 --> 55:30.659
Pull your car over.

55:31.578 --> 55:34.279
Dad! The police are chasing us.

55:34.531 --> 55:35.280
- Hey Baz.
- Yeah.

55:35.365 --> 55:37.566
Stop your vehicle now!

55:37.617 --> 55:39.001
Drive faster.

55:39.068 --> 55:40.369
No worries mate.

55:42.672 --> 55:43.422
Fast enough for ya?

55:43.506 --> 55:44.289
Yeah.

55:47.711 --> 55:49.178
Pull to the side of the road.

55:55.218 --> 55:56.685
Stop your vehicle now.

56:01.641 --> 56:03.475
Hey Baz, is that nitrous button?

56:03.560 --> 56:05.427
- It certainly is mate.
- What do yo say we hit that?

56:05.478 --> 56:07.196
- Give it a go.
- Hold on folks.

56:15.104 --> 56:18.540
Hold on to your panties ladies.

56:23.946 --> 56:24.713
Oh man!

56:24.781 --> 56:27.466
Whoo! Now this is fun.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.453
I think we lost them.

56:33.723 --> 56:34.723
Now we're talking.

56:43.633 --> 56:44.316
Ok.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.268
It should be smooth sailing from here.

56:49.472 --> 56:51.824
Why is there a retirement home
next to an airport?

56:51.908 --> 56:54.026
Because old people can't hear.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.647
It doesn't look like they've left.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.198
Their cars are still here.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.852
I'm gonna go look upstairs.

57:36.903 --> 57:38.287
Ok. I'll check these rooms.

57:38.521 --> 57:39.187
Matt?

57:40.022 --> 57:40.656
Matt?

57:42.191 --> 57:43.242
Has anybody seen anything?

57:58.641 --> 57:59.258
Matt?

58:00.426 --> 58:01.643
Matt?

58:13.940 --> 58:15.357
It's time to leave Kansas mate.

58:17.710 --> 58:18.827
There's no one up here.

58:19.529 --> 58:20.462
Where is everyone?

58:42.986 --> 58:44.653
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa!

58:44.720 --> 58:47.439
No no no. I'm looking for Matt.
Is there a Matt here?

58:47.524 --> 58:48.574
Matt?

58:48.658 --> 58:50.609
Uh, yeah yeah. I'm Matt. Who are
you?

58:50.693 --> 58:51.660
Guys I found Matt com on.

58:51.727 --> 58:53.245
Come here. He's in here.

58:54.330 --> 58:55.414
Matt!

58:55.498 --> 58:56.949
Dad? Mom?

58:57.033 --> 58:58.834
What are you guys doing here?

58:59.953 --> 59:01.903
We had to come inland to avoid the storm.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.905
- We came in to get you.
- There's sharks everywhere.

59:03.957 --> 59:05.173
Sharks?

59:05.241 --> 59:06.592
Is this the best shelter you got?

59:06.676 --> 59:08.544
Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar.

59:08.595 --> 59:10.596
We better find something to
protect ourselves and quick.

59:10.680 --> 59:11.930
From what?

59:12.015 --> 59:13.482
They couldn't possibly make it
all the way out here.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.467
They can.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.935
It's entirely possible. A hurricane can
pick up marine life out of the ocean

59:17.020 --> 59:18.587
and drop it hundreds of miles away.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.590
Hold this.

59:21.658 --> 59:23.758
Yeah, he's right. It happened once near Alice Springs.
100s of perch fell from the sky.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.127
Why not Sharks?

59:25.761 --> 59:27.762
Look, what the hell is going on here?

59:39.659 --> 59:43.111
It's a Sharknado!

59:43.880 --> 59:46.048
Let's get inside here. Get in
get in.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.009
The news said that there is 3 tornadoes
in the area. We're not safe here.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.896
What's the fastest way to get out of here?

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.347
Can that fly?

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:59.571
I don't know. Let me check.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.790
Looks pretty beat up.

01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:04.626
Hey you know what? She'll fly.

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.078
We're not all gonna fit in here.

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.245
We can't fly in these storms.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.497
Then what are we gonna do?

01:01:08.548 --> 01:01:09.998
We're gonna stand and fight?

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:14.202
We just wait and wait here for
sharks to rain down to us again.

01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:18.140
We need to arm ourselves with
something more powerful then these.

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:20.342
What were you thinking?

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.893
That store, It's got everything
we need.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.564
Sepra peratus.

01:01:35.057 --> 01:01:36.074
They must have evacuated.

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.527
How are we getting in?

01:01:40.747 --> 01:01:42.897
Guys stand back. I have the key.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.371
Dad, I'll be right back.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.707
I have an idea. Come with me.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.108
Oh nice! This is what I'm talking about.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.789
Hey, do you think you can make
this work?

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:24.990
Yeah. I'll make it work.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:25.824
Good.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:26.875
Bombs.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:33.465
Bombs?

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:37.385
Instead of letting live sharks rain down on
people, we are going to get in that chopper

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:41.173
and throw bombs into the tornadoes.
Blasting those bastards to bits.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.012
I like it, but how is that gonna
stop a tornado?

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:50.265
Tornadoes happen when cold and
warm air meet.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:56.738
Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the
middle of it, You might just equalize it.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:02.444
But if you miss, we're screwed.

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:06.615
Oh, hell no. You got a death
wish? No way!

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:08.700
Dad, I'm the only one that could do it.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.985
Bobby and Noellen haven't even solo yet.

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:13.421
What's wrong?

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:16.508
Your son wants to go into a helicopter
and drop a bomb into the tornado.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.293
No! It's too dangerous.

01:03:18.344 --> 01:03:20.212
I'll watch his back. I'll be his
bombardier.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.713
Then definitely not.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.683
Dad, we have a chance to save
thousands of lives. Maybe more.

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:27.686
You always taught me to help
others. I'm going.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.072
He's right April. We'll work it out together.
I won't let anything happen to him.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.274
Don't you understand you can die Matt?

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.341
Mom, we don't have any other option.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.277
And you are not gonna stop me.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.846
He certainly is your son.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:41.783
Shopping cart?

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:42.784
Yeah.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:48.907
Claud?

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:50.375
Claud?

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.997
Hey! Come on. What are you doing
down here? What's the problem?

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.535
You.

01:04:01.203 --> 01:04:02.470
Your my problem.

01:04:02.722 --> 01:04:04.840
Are we really gonna do that now?
Now?

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.046
Look, what are you and mom doing?

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:15.817
You guys can barely stand to be in a
room together for 5 minutes, and now

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:20.071
What? Cause you are saving Matt
you're best friends again?

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.606
He is my son.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.525
I'm your daughter.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.362
You guys are always there for him
and you're never there for me.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.735
Hey get that one. No no the
other one.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.670
You don't think I try?

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.207
Not hard enough.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.913
I came for you first.

01:04:48.768 --> 01:04:49.751
Try to remember that.

01:04:52.605 --> 01:04:54.189
Come on. Come on.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:17.445
Hey.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.614
I fell off a slide when I was 2.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.883
It hurt like hell.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.451
Now people think it's cool.

01:05:25.287 --> 01:05:27.222
No body thinks this is cool.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:30.892
What happened?

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:33.979
I had a tattoo removed.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.135
I don't like to talk about it.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.999
I was raised by my grandparents.

01:05:55.835 --> 01:06:00.839
We I was 7 my grandpa took me fishing with
one of those day charter deals with his friends.

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:06.761
We end up hitting into a reef
and the boat went down.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:13.852
My grandfather took me and put me
inside this little life- raft for safety.

01:06:15.187 --> 01:06:20.809
Everyone else was kinda swimming around
trying to stay up and suddenly all these

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.979
sharks just started swarming and-

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.649
and then they...

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.951
tried to protect me but...

01:06:32.187 --> 01:06:33.822
By morning they were all gone.

01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:40.361
So I floated out there for 2 days
until one of those coast guard

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.747
helicopters finally spotted me.

01:06:44.383 --> 01:06:51.056
I thought I was safe but suddenly
this shark leaped up and bit my leg.

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:56.811
6 people went into the water and
one little girl came out.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:06:59.981
The sharks took the rest.

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.187
They took my grandfather.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.274
So I really hate sharks.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:14.079
Now I really hate sharks too.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.333
Nice work kids.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.953
But this, this is a bomb.

01:07:40.255 --> 01:07:41.523
Dad, the tornado is coming.

01:08:00.192 --> 01:08:01.008
Hey!

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.176
Hey what are you doing?

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:07.232
In case things don't work out,
We're going to move to plan B.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:10.201
Baz builds a bigger bomb, and
drives this in into the storm.

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:13.321
That's not gonna work. It's a
one way trip.

01:08:13.372 --> 01:08:14.789
Especially with that leg.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:15.490
You want to see me try?

01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:16.858
No!

01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:18.710
Fin, look after your family.
They are a good bunch.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:20.995
It's fine.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.224
Alright, do what you gotta do.

01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:35.176
Don't I always?

01:08:37.563 --> 01:08:38.229
I will.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:46.904
Watch our backs.

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:48.439
Be careful.

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:08.760
Alright get ready.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:30.231
Do we have enough bombs?

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.450
Sure hope so.

01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:42.160
First time on a chopper?

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:42.961
Yeah.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:44.946
Scared?

01:09:44.997 --> 01:09:45.964
Hell No!

01:09:54.974 --> 01:09:55.673
Oh Crap.

01:09:56.508 --> 01:09:57.508
Look at all those sharks!

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.072
Look out! More Sharks!

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.525
What are we gonna do?

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.810
You got it dad.

01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:17.912
Oh my god, there's just too many
of them!

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.250
We're gonna need a bigger chopper.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.754
- I hope this bomb idea of yours works.
- Trust me. It will.

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.378
- We're getting close. Get Ready.
- Ready?

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:37.932
- Yeah. Bombs. Bombs.
- Bombs. Bombs Bombs Bombs.

01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:41.052
Careful with those Robert.

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:01.239
Alright, here's how you do it.
Open the valve.

01:11:06.078 --> 01:11:07.412
First tornado coming to the left here.

01:11:15.004 --> 01:11:17.422
Push the button. Hold it for 3
seconds. We're gonna count.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.175
Ok.

01:11:21.226 --> 01:11:25.096
1. 2. 3.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.147
Strike!

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:50.571
Whoo! Hahaha.

01:11:50.622 --> 01:11:52.090
- Whoo! I did it!
- Told ya!

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.441
That worked!

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:54.459
Fin!

01:12:11.143 --> 01:12:12.760
How's the front end looking Bobby?

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.445
I'm not a captain yet sir.

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.114
Bobby look out!

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:18.533
Get down!

01:12:30.329 --> 01:12:31.779
The tornado is coming this way.

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:35.333
Baz!

01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:38.970
Second tornado! Second tornado!

01:12:40.139 --> 01:12:43.424
The tornado is headed towards the airport.
We need to destroy it before it get to them.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.344
Why!

01:12:51.016 --> 01:12:52.984
Baz! Baz!

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.023
Dad! You have to leave him!

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.644
It's getting closer. We have to
go now of we're dead.

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.619
OK, Tell me when.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.541
Come on. Come on.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.076
Let's go up there!

01:13:21.547 --> 01:13:25.917
Ok people, everybody out of the pool.
Everybody needs to get out of the pool and inside.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:29.036
Yes Carl that means you. Out now
please.

01:13:32.874 --> 01:13:36.310
<i>This is Jonni Waves</i>
<i>that's Joni with an "I" reporting live</i>

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:40.714
<i>as just one of these massive tornados</i>
<i>is about to tear through Hollywood</i>

01:13:40.766 --> 01:13:45.103
<i>and it's headed on course through the</i>
<i>Valley and onto Van Nuys. It's about to tear</i>

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.654
<i>through the city of Los Aahh!</i>

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.910
Getting close to the second tornado.

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:54.579
Already got another one.

01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:02.003
Press the button down for 3 seconds.
We're gonna count together. - Ok ok ok.

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:06.457
Alright. 1.2.3.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.425
Light it!

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.487
Falling sharks!

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:04.932
Come on let's get them inside.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:26.003
Oh my god. Run! Run!

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.123
- Run! Honey!
- I can't run, I can't even walk!

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.164
Alright. Third tornado.

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:11.882
Look at the size of that thing.

01:16:12.867 --> 01:16:13.634
Just stay focused.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:21.475
- It's showtime!
- I'm on it!

01:16:23.262 --> 01:16:23.978
Go it!

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.576
Alright. Strike it!

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.259
Who is that up there?

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.410
That's my son.

01:16:57.912 --> 01:16:59.680
You must be so proud.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.049
Yeah. Yeah I am.

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:04.552
Its not working.

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:06.921
The bomb didn't land right.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.780
- Hey!
- We're out of bombs. What do we do?

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.199
I'll head back to base.

01:17:19.951 --> 01:17:21.068
Turbulence is picking up.

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.039
Oh my god!

01:17:28.794 --> 01:17:30.294
The Shark! The Shark!

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.802
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Get off me get off me!

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:44.675
Die already! Why won't you die!

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.015
Ooh! Oh my god!

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.302
No!

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:22.179
Help!

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:24.932
Matt!

01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:29.103
Get everybody to safely.

01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:31.772
Come on everybody! Let's get
away from the window.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.182
Matt! Matt!

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.207
Matt! Matt!

01:18:50.742 --> 01:18:52.660
Come on! Come on! Get out of
here.

01:18:52.711 --> 01:18:54.361
Come here. Come on.

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:02.837
Are you alright?

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:05.205
Yeah. Yeah where is mom and
Claudia?

01:19:05.257 --> 01:19:06.056
They're on the hill.

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:07.591
Where's Nova?

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:09.810
She - Didn't make it.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:11.545
Go look after your mother and sister.

01:19:11.596 --> 01:19:12.713
Where you going?

01:19:12.764 --> 01:19:13.814
I'm going to finish this.

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.685
Move! Get out of the way!

01:21:31.736 --> 01:21:32.953
Daddy!

01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:38.709
Get out of there!

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:41.528
Get outta the way!

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:47.551
Claudia Move!

01:22:00.214 --> 01:22:00.898
Fin!

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:05.769
Dad!

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.058
Dad!

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.700
Oh my god.

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:25.956
Dad?

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.278
Dad!

01:23:18.343 --> 01:23:19.093
Nova!

01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:23.681
Come on.

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:32.940
- Dad are you ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:32.991 --> 01:23:33.857
Oh my god.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.033
Breathe. Breathe!

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:46.503
Come on!

01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:58.849
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.643
I really hate sharks.

01:24:13.231 --> 01:24:16.533
- Thank you! Thank you.
- You're Welcome.

01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:42.092
I never got your real name.

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.514
Jenny Lynn.

01:24:49.383 --> 01:24:51.852
Nice to meet you... Jenny Lynn.

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:10.037
Hell of a day.
