<i>People die.</i>

01:52.469 --> 01:56.269
<i>You may think you can
control when or where</i>

01:56.340 --> 02:01.437
<i>or how it happens, but you can't.</i>

02:01.478 --> 02:05.642

your number is up,</i>

anyone can do about it.</i>

02:08.985 --> 02:09.918
<i>Charge.</i>

02:12.956 --> 02:14.981
It's over, Jack.

02:16.827 --> 02:19.955
<i>I've lost patients before,</i>

02:20.030 --> 02:24.023
<i>seen them die on my table,
under my knife.</i>

02:24.101 --> 02:25.966
I'm sorry, Jack.

02:26.036 --> 02:29.665
<i>But I've never lost a friend.</i>

02:29.740 --> 02:33.267
<i>I lost Clayton at 6:32 a.m.</i>

02:33.343 --> 02:37.211
<i>on Thursday,
the first day of November.</i>

02:39.883 --> 02:45.116
<i>There's not much I can
tell you about that day.</i>

02:45.188 --> 02:47.088
<i>I don't know if he
woke up that morning</i>

02:47.157 --> 02:50.320
<i>thinking he might die.</i>

02:50.394 --> 02:54.956
<i>I only know the day started
much like any other day,</i>

02:55.032 --> 02:57.899
<i>and that he was probably thinking of her.</i>

04:00.631 --> 04:02.326
Hey.

04:02.399 --> 04:03.525
Hey.

04:05.902 --> 04:07.563
What were you doing under there?

04:08.939 --> 04:10.338
Just thinking.

04:11.908 --> 04:14.069
What about?

04:14.144 --> 04:16.271
Wait, let me guess.

04:16.346 --> 04:22.182
You were thinking about
making love to me all morning

04:22.252 --> 04:25.016
and then taking me out
for a really big breakfast.

04:25.088 --> 04:27.613
- Close.
- Yeah?

04:30.794 --> 04:33.592
Actually, I was...

04:33.664 --> 04:36.462
picturing you soaking wet
with all of your clothes on.

04:36.533 --> 04:37.932
- No. Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.001 --> 04:39.400
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.760
- Dah. Ah.
- Oh.

05:12.836 --> 05:13.768
Damn it.

05:13.837 --> 05:16.670
All right, hang on.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.605
Tell me if it hurts, okay?

05:19.976 --> 05:21.273
- Ah!
- Shit.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.710
You're such an asshole.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.873
- Come here.
- I didn't scare you, did I?

05:25.949 --> 05:27.576
You did.

05:27.651 --> 05:29.744
There we go.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.946
How's it look?

05:31.021 --> 05:32.511
You'll live.

05:42.299 --> 05:43.857
Thank you.

05:48.038 --> 05:49.005
Have you seen my pager?

05:49.072 --> 05:51.131
- Yep.
- Ah.

05:51.208 --> 05:53.142
Wait. Hang on.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.974
- There you go.
- Thanks.

05:56.046 --> 05:57.035
I don't care, Tommy.

05:57.114 --> 05:58.775
They open at 6,
we open at 5, all right?

05:58.849 --> 05:59.781
There are jobs at stake, man.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.681
Just get it done.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.721
Then we'll talk to them at
the Halloween thing tonight.

06:04.788 --> 06:06.085
Yeah, all right. I'll be in soon.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.324
Got time for a little breakfast?

06:11.394 --> 06:12.986
You know I can't.

06:13.063 --> 06:15.588
You know, share a paper,
trade sections?

06:15.665 --> 06:17.826
Baby, I'm late as it is.

06:17.901 --> 06:20.665
I don't even know
what section you like, Clay.

06:38.388 --> 06:42.017
I deserve my happily
ever after, too.

06:42.092 --> 06:45.721
I know you do.

06:45.796 --> 06:49.493
And I'm going to tell her, soon.

06:49.566 --> 06:51.227
I promise.

06:55.338 --> 06:56.327
Have a good day.

06:56.406 --> 06:58.135
You, too.

07:35.412 --> 07:37.778
Good morning, Mom.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.588
Don't forget we're
meeting the board at 2.

07:49.659 --> 07:50.717
I can't do 2.

07:50.794 --> 07:51.988
I'm meeting with Dr. Harper
this afternoon.

07:52.062 --> 07:52.994
Just be there.

07:53.063 --> 07:54.553
These Japanese companies
are ruthless.

07:54.631 --> 07:56.030
We have to close this merger.

07:56.099 --> 07:58.863
Is this about your old man?

07:58.935 --> 08:00.630
Is it about him?

08:00.704 --> 08:02.433
Jesus, I'm not going through this again, Jack.

08:02.505 --> 08:04.666
Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.

08:04.741 --> 08:05.969
No, my father would want me

08:06.042 --> 08:07.669
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day

08:07.744 --> 08:09.211
and go back to work, all right?

08:09.279 --> 08:11.577
If he knew what I was doing
with Sam, he'd disown me,

08:11.648 --> 08:12.706
lying to my mom like this.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.307
He'd throw me in the fucking river.

08:15.385 --> 08:18.821
I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.255
You own half of this city.

08:21.324 --> 08:25.226
You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.

08:25.295 --> 08:28.059
I think you've more than
filled his shoes, you know?

08:28.131 --> 08:31.100
My dad's feet were four sizes bigger
than mine, Jack.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.601
I can't even fill his socks.

08:33.669 --> 08:35.227
Look, I got the rings, didn't I?

08:35.304 --> 08:36.328
I got the license.

08:36.405 --> 08:38.499
No, no, no, no.
It's not that difficult.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.634
You set a date and you just do it.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.075
It's not that easy, either.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.169
- I mean, marriage...
- Look, she's your mother.

08:44.246 --> 08:47.910
You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.

08:47.984 --> 08:49.542
You don't know my mother.

08:49.619 --> 08:50.847
Listen, thanks for the fishing lesson.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.149
- I'm leaving, all right?
- All right, man.

08:52.222 --> 08:54.383
Look, just...
just come on with me.

08:56.326 --> 08:59.727
You know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

08:59.796 --> 09:01.263
there are in this country?

09:01.331 --> 09:03.561
I mean, a hard-working
doctor is trying...

09:03.633 --> 09:05.066
Are we going to go
through this again, Jack?

09:05.135 --> 09:06.898
- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.494
All for trying to save people's lives.

09:08.571 --> 09:09.936
It's a disgrace.

09:10.006 --> 09:11.234
Well, you know why they sue us?

09:11.308 --> 09:12.707
I have a very busy day.

09:12.776 --> 09:14.175
Please.

09:14.244 --> 09:18.146
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.

09:18.214 --> 09:22.651
It's because people
need someone to blame.

09:22.719 --> 09:25.916
It's because of patients like you

09:25.989 --> 09:30.323
who cannot accept the facts.

09:30.393 --> 09:31.985
Come on in.

09:32.062 --> 09:34.860
Get acquainted. Lie down.

09:36.366 --> 09:39.062
Only because you're my friend.

09:39.135 --> 09:41.296
I'm your doctor.

09:46.776 --> 09:48.607
Get comfortable.

09:54.851 --> 09:57.376
How's it feel?

09:57.454 --> 09:59.046
Not so bad.

09:59.122 --> 10:03.559
These, Clay, are the facts.

10:03.626 --> 10:07.426
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,

10:07.497 --> 10:12.958
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.

10:13.036 --> 10:15.903
And if the transplant is successful,

10:15.972 --> 10:20.932
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.

10:21.011 --> 10:24.174
The clock's ticking.

10:24.247 --> 10:26.841
So it's tough love today, huh?

10:26.916 --> 10:28.975
You think this is a joke?

10:31.721 --> 10:33.746
Look at that.

10:33.823 --> 10:35.290
Hold it.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.758
That's surgical steel.

10:37.827 --> 10:40.421
A hundredth of an inch thick.

10:40.497 --> 10:45.560
That thing will slice through you
as if you weren't even there.

10:47.303 --> 10:50.033
Picture it, Clay.

10:50.106 --> 10:52.040
Picture the incision.

10:54.144 --> 10:56.840
Imagine what it will be like.

10:58.448 --> 11:00.780
I need you to be ready.

11:02.218 --> 11:05.278
I need you to be prepared.

11:05.355 --> 11:08.688
You get your house
in order, just in case.

11:10.293 --> 11:14.923
Tell your mother, marry the girl,
and live your life.

11:16.066 --> 11:19.934
You might not have much of it left.

11:20.003 --> 11:21.800
Okay?

11:21.871 --> 11:23.668
Jack...

11:23.740 --> 11:25.071
saddle up.

11:25.141 --> 11:27.405
Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.

11:27.477 --> 11:29.342
No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,

11:29.412 --> 11:30.344
he's in the ICU bleeding.

11:30.413 --> 11:31.812
He took off for
the fucking vineyard,

11:31.881 --> 11:33.746
so, uh... Hey, Clay.

11:33.817 --> 11:35.341
How about letting us
have all your money

11:35.418 --> 11:36.578
so that we could retire?

11:36.653 --> 11:38.587
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?

11:38.655 --> 11:39.587
No. You know me.

11:39.656 --> 11:41.647
Go ahead, take it all.

11:41.724 --> 11:43.191
What a guy.

11:43.259 --> 11:46.126
Remember what I said, Clay.

11:46.196 --> 11:47.720
No regrets.

11:47.797 --> 11:48.729
Jack!

11:48.798 --> 11:50.595
The clock's ticking.

11:50.667 --> 11:51.599
Jack, what are you doing?

11:51.668 --> 11:53.659
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.

11:53.736 --> 11:56.204
Come on!

11:56.272 --> 11:58.832
<i>Promise me you'll kiss me all over.</i>

11:58.908 --> 12:00.432
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

12:00.510 --> 12:02.444
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

12:02.512 --> 12:04.207
<i>What's wrong with right now?</i>

12:04.280 --> 12:05.679
Well, I can't. I'm...

12:05.748 --> 12:09.013
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

12:09.085 --> 12:11.485
You look beautiful, Sam.

12:11.554 --> 12:13.181
I do?

12:13.256 --> 12:15.087
Yeah, you do.

12:15.158 --> 12:17.456
I should tell you that more often.

12:20.563 --> 12:21.825
What's wrong?

12:21.898 --> 12:24.389
I'm sorry.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.526
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?

12:26.603 --> 12:28.127
If I turn around, she'll see.

12:28.204 --> 12:30.570
This is getting boring, Clay.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.800
Uh-huh.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.605
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.

12:34.677 --> 12:36.167
I feel sick.

12:36.246 --> 12:40.148
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.

12:41.284 --> 12:42.945
Thought you'd run off and left me.

12:43.019 --> 12:45.078
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?

12:45.155 --> 12:46.087
Hello, Clayton.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.145
Good to see you again.

12:47.223 --> 12:48.451
We've already been through this.

12:48.525 --> 12:50.425
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...

12:50.493 --> 12:53.394
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?

12:53.463 --> 12:55.522
Yeah, well, like I said before,

12:55.598 --> 12:57.566
I have a surgeon.

12:57.634 --> 13:01.229
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,

13:01.304 --> 13:03.738
but that's completely
normal for his type.

13:03.806 --> 13:08.436
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.

13:08.511 --> 13:11.002
It just means
you're special, that's all.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.513
Excuse me.

13:12.582 --> 13:14.345
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...

13:14.417 --> 13:15.714
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy

13:15.785 --> 13:17.047
of undetermined etiology...

13:17.120 --> 13:19.020
Hey.

13:19.088 --> 13:20.112
I'm sitting right here.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.590
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.

13:22.659 --> 13:25.127
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.

13:25.195 --> 13:28.460
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.

13:28.531 --> 13:30.556
He was on call when you had
your first attack.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.430
He saved your life.

13:32.502 --> 13:34.595
I get the attachment. Really, I do.

13:34.671 --> 13:37.936
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.

13:38.007 --> 13:40.498
My hands have been
inside presidents.

13:40.577 --> 13:43.944
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?

13:44.013 --> 13:47.176
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.083
Don't you, Clay?

13:50.153 --> 13:51.415
Good.

13:51.654 --> 13:54.521
Now let's talk about the party tonight.

13:55.525 --> 13:58.187
<i>No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

13:58.261 --> 13:59.819
<i>Now see, that is where
you're wrong.</i>

13:59.896 --> 14:01.989
<i>I just don't see
the growth in leadership.</i>

14:02.065 --> 14:03.999
<i>That's why this whole
Beresford Capital business</i>

14:04.067 --> 14:05.193
<i>scares me so much.</i>

14:05.268 --> 14:07.065
<i>Now look, are my numbers
wrong here?</i>

14:07.136 --> 14:09.798
<i>Because if the Shimotomo merger
does not go through soon,</i>

14:09.872 --> 14:11.965
<i>then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble.</i>

14:12.041 --> 14:13.702
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

14:13.776 --> 14:16.438
<i>Look, I'm telling you,
Beresford better stay away from Shimotomo.</i>

14:16.512 --> 14:17.740
<i>They're going to smile at your face,</i>

14:17.814 --> 14:19.338
<i>and then they're going
to stab you in the back.</i>

14:19.415 --> 14:20.439
<i>These guys are dangerous.</i>

14:20.516 --> 14:21.983
<i>Trust me, I've seen them do it.</i>

14:22.051 --> 14:24.110
<i>Anybody who gets
into business with them</i>

14:24.187 --> 14:25.654
<i>is really asking for trouble.</i>

14:25.722 --> 14:26.916
<i>Clay Beresford better know
what he's doing...</i>

14:26.990 --> 14:28.924
Sir, they need you out there.

14:28.992 --> 14:30.482
Thank you.

14:31.594 --> 14:33.357
Welcome.

14:33.429 --> 14:35.693
My daughter Tanya and my wife.

14:38.368 --> 14:40.199
Happy Halloween.

14:50.046 --> 14:52.276
Oh, here he is.

14:52.348 --> 14:53.679
Whiz kid of Wall Street,

14:53.750 --> 14:55.547
<i>Barron's Man of the Year at 22:</i>

14:55.618 --> 14:57.449
Clayton Beresford, Jr.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.856
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.

15:02.925 --> 15:05.450
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.

15:05.528 --> 15:06.722
They're here to check up on you.

15:06.796 --> 15:07.922
They know about your condition.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.100
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know

15:15.171 --> 15:16.900
how much respect he had
for your father,

15:16.973 --> 15:18.099
Mr. Beresford.

15:18.174 --> 15:20.165
He was quite a businessman.

15:20.243 --> 15:22.006
<i>Yes, he was. Arigato.</i>

15:23.913 --> 15:26.177
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.

15:27.383 --> 15:30.011
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.

15:32.422 --> 15:33.616
Please also tell him that I'm ready

15:33.690 --> 15:35.214
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.554
In the last eight quarters alone,

15:37.627 --> 15:40.255
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.

15:40.330 --> 15:44.061
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.

15:44.133 --> 15:47.159
We provide over 16,000 jobs.

15:47.236 --> 15:51.400
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.

15:51.474 --> 15:52.964
And the only thing
you need to worry about

15:53.042 --> 15:54.976
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes

15:55.044 --> 15:56.807
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.

16:11.427 --> 16:13.895
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?

16:13.963 --> 16:15.897
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.

16:15.965 --> 16:18.433
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.

16:18.501 --> 16:19.991
I'm serious this time.

16:20.069 --> 16:22.367
Let's just leave
the country, you know?

16:22.438 --> 16:24.201
Go to China.

16:24.273 --> 16:25.740
Try our luck on the black market.

16:25.808 --> 16:27.173
Why don't we just go outside?

16:27.243 --> 16:28.938
We'll grab some random
person off the street,

16:29.011 --> 16:29.943
drag them in here, you know...

16:30.012 --> 16:31.309
Sounds good to me.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.179
Drag them in and cut them open.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.912
Hey, whatever it takes, right?

16:36.986 --> 16:38.419
You worry too much,
you know that?

16:38.488 --> 16:39.978
Oh.

16:40.056 --> 16:41.648
They'll find me one.

16:41.724 --> 16:45.455
It just takes a little time, that's all.

16:45.528 --> 16:48.019
You're not going to like this.

16:49.565 --> 16:50.657
Straight to the king.

16:50.733 --> 16:54.225
Oh, nice hand!

16:54.303 --> 16:56.794
Boat. Jacks over eights.

16:56.873 --> 16:59.068
Are you kidding me? Again?

16:59.142 --> 17:00.166
Come on, you're my son.

17:00.243 --> 17:03.701
Can't hide anything
from your mother.

17:03.780 --> 17:06.271
I think I need to go upstairs.

17:11.186 --> 17:13.382
Don't stay up too late.

17:17.026 --> 17:18.653
<i>Beresford Capital
opened higher today</i>

17:18.728 --> 17:22.664
<i>after their announcement of the Dirasonic
acquisition over the weekend.</i>

17:22.732 --> 17:24.723
<i>This bodes well for
the New York-based company,</i>

17:24.800 --> 17:27.166
<i>especially since continued merger
discussions</i>

17:27.236 --> 17:30.831
<i>with the Shimotomo Corporation
have left investors feeling anxious.</i>

17:30.907 --> 17:33.774
<i>The Japanese government's investigation
into the Shimotomo family's</i>

17:33.843 --> 17:35.674
<i>alleged links to organized crime</i>

17:35.745 --> 17:37.645
<i>were well-documented last quarter.</i>

17:37.713 --> 17:39.806
<i>And with that merger still in question,</i>

17:39.882 --> 17:43.943
<i>the Dirasonic acquisition will go a great way
to calming investors' concerns</i>

17:44.020 --> 17:46.352
<i>that Beresford is playing with fire.</i>

17:46.422 --> 17:48.219
<i>Still, rumors surrounding
the merger...</i>

17:48.291 --> 17:50.691
I thought you might like a little drink.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.320
Oh, maybe one. Thank you.

17:53.396 --> 17:54.829
You're up late.

17:54.897 --> 17:56.455
Something on your mind?

17:58.067 --> 18:00.001
Got to get my family time in now.

18:00.069 --> 18:02.264
You know, before some
smoothy whisks you away.

18:02.338 --> 18:03.270
Yeah, right.

18:03.339 --> 18:04.465
Like that's going to happen.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.565
I don't know.

18:06.642 --> 18:10.009
I think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on Dr. Neyer.

18:10.079 --> 18:12.172
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

18:12.248 --> 18:14.239
I don't need anyone else.

18:14.317 --> 18:17.047
I got you, Clay. Remember?

18:17.119 --> 18:18.984
So, I closed Lambert today.

18:19.055 --> 18:20.682
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,

18:20.756 --> 18:24.123
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...

18:24.193 --> 18:26.058
Do you remember him, Clay?

18:29.298 --> 18:30.595
I remember bits.

18:30.666 --> 18:31.690
Like what?

18:33.569 --> 18:35.093
He died at Christmas.

18:35.171 --> 18:37.935
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?

18:38.007 --> 18:40.441
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.206
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.

18:46.148 --> 18:47.945
I remember he smiled a lot.

18:54.023 --> 18:56.150
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.

18:56.225 --> 18:57.852
Uh, door was open.

18:57.927 --> 18:59.326
What?

18:59.395 --> 19:00.692
I just need your signature.

19:00.763 --> 19:03.698
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.

19:03.766 --> 19:05.734
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.

19:05.801 --> 19:06.995
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,

19:07.069 --> 19:08.161
your table's locked for the benefit,

19:08.237 --> 19:09.795
and I put you down for the roast beef.

19:09.872 --> 19:11.066
I know it's your favorite.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.404
You're too good to me, Sam.

19:15.811 --> 19:20.441
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.

19:20.516 --> 19:22.450
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.

19:22.518 --> 19:23.815
Mr. Beresford.

19:37.667 --> 19:38.827
Sam!

19:40.836 --> 19:42.861
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?

19:42.939 --> 19:45.134
I just want to go home.

19:45.207 --> 19:46.936
Actually, fuck it.

19:47.009 --> 19:49.239
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.

19:49.312 --> 19:51.143
What is wrong with you?

19:51.213 --> 19:52.407
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.

19:52.481 --> 19:54.005
I've been engaged for six months.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.052
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.

19:57.119 --> 19:58.984
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

19:59.055 --> 20:00.044
I'm sorry.

20:00.122 --> 20:02.181
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...

20:02.258 --> 20:05.352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

20:05.428 --> 20:09.091
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?

20:09.165 --> 20:10.359
You can't be in the rain.

20:10.433 --> 20:13.095
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?

20:15.371 --> 20:16.929
But she'll see.

20:21.844 --> 20:23.971
Are you sure?

20:24.046 --> 20:26.378
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.

20:29.785 --> 20:32.720
I should have done this
a long time ago.

20:34.123 --> 20:36.284
She's not going to like it.

20:36.359 --> 20:37.849
Come on.

20:40.997 --> 20:42.794
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.

20:42.865 --> 20:45.959
How could you come in here
and sneak around?

20:46.035 --> 20:46.967
Please.

20:47.036 --> 20:48.298
Clay, she lied to me to my face.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.601
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.

20:50.673 --> 20:53.301
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.400
Get to know each other first.

20:54.477 --> 20:56.069
We've been together for a year.

20:56.145 --> 20:58.045
Then wait till you're a little older.

20:58.114 --> 20:59.843
How old were you
when you got married?

20:59.915 --> 21:02.315
It's different. I was too young.

21:02.385 --> 21:04.876
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

21:04.954 --> 21:06.319
Do I?

21:11.293 --> 21:14.023
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.

21:15.364 --> 21:17.457
You're making it for me.

21:29.945 --> 21:32.573
Sam, wait.

21:32.648 --> 21:34.206
Oh... oh, God.

21:34.283 --> 21:38.049
Okay. Um...

21:38.120 --> 21:40.452
Nope.

21:40.523 --> 21:41.820
Here we go.

21:41.891 --> 21:43.882
Look what we've got here.

21:45.327 --> 21:47.295
All right, sweetie.

21:47.363 --> 21:50.093
All right. Open up, honey.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.464
You okay?

21:52.535 --> 21:53.467
You okay?

21:53.536 --> 21:54.935
I am so sorry.

21:55.004 --> 21:57.199
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.

21:57.273 --> 21:59.332
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?

21:59.408 --> 22:01.569
Marry me.

22:01.644 --> 22:03.111
What?

22:03.179 --> 22:04.510
Tonight. Right now.

22:04.580 --> 22:05.842
Marry me tonight.

22:05.915 --> 22:07.746
But it's the middle of the night.

22:07.817 --> 22:10.081
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.

22:11.854 --> 22:14.254
Really?

22:18.894 --> 22:21.158
The minister is on his way,

22:21.230 --> 22:24.597
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.067
How the hell did you
pull that one off?

22:27.136 --> 22:29.331
Triple bypass last June.

22:29.405 --> 22:30.997
I'm calling in a favor.

22:32.408 --> 22:34.968
You're a good best man, Jack.

22:35.044 --> 22:36.477
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.

22:36.545 --> 22:38.479
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

22:38.547 --> 22:40.310
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.

22:40.382 --> 22:42.543
Clay, I am pulling
80 hours a week, man.

22:42.618 --> 22:44.984
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.

22:45.054 --> 22:46.954
Just... Just one, okay?

22:47.022 --> 22:48.717
You gotta take the lens cap off first.

22:48.791 --> 22:51.760
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

22:51.827 --> 22:54.159
Just one, just one.

22:55.264 --> 22:57.357
Oh, man, look at that.

22:57.433 --> 22:59.162
An actual smile.

23:03.472 --> 23:05.337
So proud of you.

23:05.407 --> 23:08.638
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

23:08.711 --> 23:10.440
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

23:10.513 --> 23:13.277
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

23:13.349 --> 23:15.874
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

23:15.951 --> 23:18.749
to be my lawful wedded husband...

23:18.821 --> 23:21.187
to be my lawful wedded husband...

23:21.257 --> 23:23.452
to have and to hold...

23:23.526 --> 23:25.517
to have and to hold...

23:25.594 --> 23:27.858
from this night forward...

23:27.930 --> 23:29.693
from this night forward...

23:29.765 --> 23:32.165
for better, for worse...

23:32.234 --> 23:34.031
for better, for worse...

23:34.103 --> 23:36.663
for richer, for poorer...

23:36.739 --> 23:39.037
for richer, for poorer...

23:39.108 --> 23:42.168
in sickness and in health...

23:42.244 --> 23:45.042
in sickness and in health...

23:45.114 --> 23:49.346
till death do us part.

23:49.418 --> 23:51.818
till death do us part.

24:11.373 --> 24:14.137
Clay.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.234
Clay, whoa!

24:15.311 --> 24:16.710
Whoa!

24:16.779 --> 24:17.837
What are you doing?

24:17.913 --> 24:19.676
What do you think I'm doing?

24:21.250 --> 24:22.877
What is...

24:25.721 --> 24:28.246
Clay.

24:29.558 --> 24:30.957
Clay.

24:32.928 --> 24:34.828
They're the only ones with the number.

24:34.897 --> 24:36.888
Holy shit.

24:40.836 --> 24:41.825
I love you.

24:41.904 --> 24:43.599
I love you, too.

24:45.407 --> 24:46.396
Here.

24:58.554 --> 25:00.249
There he is.

25:00.322 --> 25:01.789
The man of the hour.

25:01.857 --> 25:03.882
Now, what took you two so long?

25:03.959 --> 25:05.517
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.

25:05.594 --> 25:06.891
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

25:06.962 --> 25:07.894
I've heard a lot about you.

25:07.963 --> 25:09.328
Clay's a lucky man.

25:09.398 --> 25:10.387
I am.

25:11.634 --> 25:14.296
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

25:15.704 --> 25:17.467
You'll have to excuse Penny.

25:17.539 --> 25:19.097
She's not from around here.

25:19.174 --> 25:21.335
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.

25:21.410 --> 25:23.503
Very funny.

25:23.579 --> 25:24.603
Sorry I'm late.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.705
Had a hard time getting a sitter.

25:26.782 --> 25:28.647
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.

25:28.717 --> 25:30.548
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.

25:30.619 --> 25:32.644
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.

25:32.721 --> 25:35.849
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,

25:35.925 --> 25:38.189
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.160
Heart will be here in two hours.

25:40.229 --> 25:42.060
And your mother's here.

25:42.131 --> 25:43.098
What?

25:43.165 --> 25:44.826
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.

25:46.535 --> 25:48.833
What? She's on the call sheet.

25:50.973 --> 25:53.032
You certainly took your time.

25:53.108 --> 25:55.474
Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.

25:55.544 --> 25:56.738
Would you please clear it
with administration?

25:56.812 --> 25:58.507
Actually, I'm staying right here.

25:58.580 --> 26:00.275
What?

26:00.349 --> 26:02.283
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.

26:02.351 --> 26:03.682
You two know each other?

26:03.752 --> 26:05.219
Of course.

26:05.287 --> 26:06.345
Dr. Jack Harper,

26:06.422 --> 26:09.414
Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.

26:09.491 --> 26:13.450
Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.

26:13.529 --> 26:15.861
You sound like my ex-wives.

26:15.931 --> 26:18.126
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.293
Well, some of us
just don't have the time

26:20.369 --> 26:22.701
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.

26:22.771 --> 26:25.672
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.

26:25.741 --> 26:27.538
Three. I checked.

26:27.609 --> 26:29.509
Four. l...

26:29.578 --> 26:31.637
I think it's four, right, Jack?

26:32.748 --> 26:34.045
You think this is funny?

26:36.418 --> 26:41.378
Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.

26:41.457 --> 26:44.153
I write textbooks on this procedure.

26:46.028 --> 26:47.222
Really?

26:47.296 --> 26:49.025
That's... That's great.

26:49.098 --> 26:50.963
I, uh...

26:51.033 --> 26:52.625
I sure hope you've read them, Jack.

26:52.701 --> 26:54.931
Will you excuse us for a minute?

26:58.307 --> 27:00.571
Look at me. Look at me.

27:00.642 --> 27:02.633
This isn't about her.

27:02.711 --> 27:07.080
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

27:07.149 --> 27:08.241
He's my friend, Mother.

27:08.317 --> 27:10.285
I trust him.

27:10.352 --> 27:12.980
I really wish you'd start trusting me.

27:13.055 --> 27:14.613
I'm sorry, darling.

27:14.690 --> 27:16.089
The answer is no.

27:16.158 --> 27:18.820
I wasn't asking for your permission.

27:31.173 --> 27:34.438
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?

27:34.510 --> 27:36.307
Thanks, Jack.

27:41.583 --> 27:43.141
Looks nice.

27:43.218 --> 27:44.446
Does it fit?

27:44.520 --> 27:47.421
Yeah. It's perfect.

27:48.957 --> 27:50.891
Quite a night we're having, huh?

27:52.694 --> 27:54.321
I'm scared shitless.

27:54.396 --> 27:56.557
I know. Me, too.

27:56.632 --> 27:58.497
But, hey, you know what?

27:58.567 --> 28:01.092
As soon as you get out of here,

28:01.170 --> 28:04.162
we're going to start from scratch.

28:04.239 --> 28:05.900
Get a little house on the beach.

28:05.974 --> 28:08.408
- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?

28:08.477 --> 28:09.409
Chase seagulls.

28:09.478 --> 28:11.571
What do you say?

28:13.382 --> 28:17.216
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.

28:19.688 --> 28:22.987
You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?

28:32.267 --> 28:33.598
Okay, lovebirds.

28:33.669 --> 28:35.569
We gotta go.

28:35.637 --> 28:38.367
All right.

28:40.142 --> 28:43.578
I'll see you soon... wife.

28:44.847 --> 28:46.439
Say that again.

28:46.515 --> 28:49.040
Wife!

29:16.712 --> 29:20.546
Sometimes you have to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.

29:24.553 --> 29:26.578
I don't need your help.

29:36.598 --> 29:38.225
Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.291
Uh, you can call me Larry.

29:40.369 --> 29:43.634
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.

29:43.705 --> 29:46.105
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.609
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.

29:48.677 --> 29:50.406
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.

29:50.479 --> 29:52.538
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.

29:52.614 --> 29:55.082
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.

29:55.150 --> 29:58.881
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

30:00.322 --> 30:02.654
We've been, um,
together a long time.

30:02.724 --> 30:04.021
Sort of like a little family.

30:04.092 --> 30:05.684
This is Dr. Puttnam.

30:05.761 --> 30:07.524
I understand.

30:07.596 --> 30:08.824
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

30:08.897 --> 30:10.159
How's the patient feeling?

30:10.232 --> 30:11.699
Okay.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.291
Everything all right?

30:13.368 --> 30:15.097
Just fine, Clay.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.195
Hey, Penny.

30:17.272 --> 30:19.263
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?

30:20.509 --> 30:21.908
All right.

30:21.977 --> 30:23.103
Okay, Clay.

30:23.178 --> 30:25.078
This is it.

30:25.147 --> 30:26.375
Mm-hmm.

30:26.448 --> 30:28.780
You just relax, all right?

30:28.850 --> 30:32.217
The next time you see me,
this is all going to be over.

30:33.789 --> 30:34.949
See you soon.

30:38.794 --> 30:41.354
Be gentle with him, okay?

30:43.699 --> 30:46.896
Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.

30:46.969 --> 30:48.869
They already asked you
if you had anything

30:48.937 --> 30:50.495
to eat or drink in the last four hours?

30:50.572 --> 30:52.301
Yeah.

30:52.374 --> 30:54.433
And you've had general anesthetic before?

30:54.509 --> 30:55.498
Mm-hmm.

30:55.577 --> 30:57.101
Good.

30:57.179 --> 31:00.046
I read your pre-op assessment

31:00.115 --> 31:03.642
and came up with a nice
little cocktail.

31:03.719 --> 31:06.552
A little abduction agent.
You're going to like this.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.017
Hang on tight.

31:13.161 --> 31:16.153
Oh, my God.

31:16.231 --> 31:18.961
Yeah. That's Him all right.

31:19.034 --> 31:22.697
Go ahead and count back
from ten for me, will you?

31:22.771 --> 31:23.738
Ten...

31:25.474 --> 31:30.036
nine, eight,

31:30.112 --> 31:31.704
seven...

31:34.583 --> 31:35.572
si...

31:41.657 --> 31:43.955
Happy trails, my friend.

31:52.501 --> 31:54.059
<i>All right.</i>

31:54.136 --> 31:56.195
<i>Just let yourself go.</i>

31:56.271 --> 31:57.738
<i>making love to me all morning.</i>

31:57.806 --> 32:00.400
<i>Just let yourself drift away.</i>

32:02.911 --> 32:05.004
<i>Off you go.</i>

32:06.848 --> 32:07.906
<i>Okay.</i>

32:07.983 --> 32:08.915
Let's get going.

32:08.984 --> 32:10.679
<i>I'm ready.</i>

32:10.752 --> 32:13.414
<i>Let's do it.</i>

32:13.488 --> 32:15.080
Hey, Larry, what did you use here?

32:15.157 --> 32:17.523
Midazolam? Fentanyl? Hmm?

32:17.592 --> 32:19.787
Yeah, with a little
pancuronium chaser.

32:19.861 --> 32:21.692
<i>God, I wonder
what the scar's going to look like.</i>

32:24.199 --> 32:27.032
<i>Ah!</i>

32:27.102 --> 32:29.536
<i>Don't you guys use shaving cream?</i>

32:32.274 --> 32:34.572
<i>Ooh, that's freezing.</i>

32:36.378 --> 32:39.506
<i>What is that? That stinks.</i>

32:39.581 --> 32:43.483
<i>God, aren't I supposed
to be out for all this?</i>

32:43.552 --> 32:45.986
<i>How long does it take
for this stuff to work anyway?</i>

32:46.054 --> 32:47.453
How does he look, Larry?

32:47.522 --> 32:48.887
Everything okay?

32:48.957 --> 32:51.050
Sleeping like a baby.

32:51.126 --> 32:52.787
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

32:52.861 --> 32:54.226
Is he good to go?

32:54.296 --> 32:55.228
Jack...

32:55.297 --> 32:56.229
You ready?

32:56.298 --> 32:57.697
Ready as I'll ever be.

32:57.766 --> 33:01.463
<i>Wait. Am I supposed
to be asleep right now?</i>

33:01.536 --> 33:04.130
All right, let's get the drapes on.

33:04.206 --> 33:05.230
<i>Hold on.</i>

33:06.408 --> 33:10.777
<i>Guys, l...
I can still hear you.</i>

33:10.846 --> 33:13.440
<i>Am I supposed to be able
to still hear you?</i>

33:16.718 --> 33:18.345
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.</i>

33:18.420 --> 33:19.682
Give me another drape right here.

33:19.755 --> 33:20.813
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

33:20.889 --> 33:22.914
<i>Something's definitely wrong, Jack.</i>

33:22.991 --> 33:25.516
<i>Listen to me. I can feel that.</i>

33:25.594 --> 33:28.154
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

33:28.230 --> 33:30.926
<i>Okay? I'm... I'm still awake!</i>

33:30.999 --> 33:32.864
<i>Just stop.</i>

33:32.934 --> 33:35.368
<i>Aw, come on. Look at the machines.</i>

33:35.437 --> 33:36.495
<i>All right? I'm not under yet.</i>

33:36.571 --> 33:37.731
<i>Look at the fucking monitors!</i>

33:37.806 --> 33:39.467
We're okay to go?

33:39.541 --> 33:41.475
<i>Jesus, this isn't fucking happening!</i>

33:41.543 --> 33:42.532
Scalpel.

33:42.611 --> 33:44.374
<i>Move something! Do something, Clay!</i>

33:44.446 --> 33:46.414
<i>Move... Move an arm,
move a finger!</i>

33:46.481 --> 33:48.847
<i>Come on, open your eyes!</i>

33:48.917 --> 33:54.184
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

33:58.960 --> 34:00.359
Do we have blood in the room?

34:00.429 --> 34:03.421
Yes. We have four units.

34:03.498 --> 34:04.988
We gotta get
this thing sharpened.

34:05.066 --> 34:07.000
<i>Jack! Please! Oh, God!</i>

34:07.068 --> 34:09.195
Having a hard time getting through.

34:09.271 --> 34:11.501
<i>Come on! Come on, Clay.</i>

34:11.572 --> 34:13.335
Saw.

34:13.408 --> 34:14.466
<i>You're gonna...
You're gonna be okay.</i>

34:14.543 --> 34:16.773
<i>- One, two...
- Just... hold on.</i>

34:16.844 --> 34:19.143
<i>- Everything's going to be... okay.
...three.</i>

34:19.214 --> 34:23.344
<i>Ah! It's just pain.</i>

34:23.418 --> 34:24.976
<i>It's just pain.</i>

34:25.053 --> 34:26.679
<i>It doesn't hurt.</i>

34:26.755 --> 34:28.154
<i>It doesn't fucking hurt!</i>

34:28.223 --> 34:30.157
<i>Come on, Clay, focus!</i>

34:30.225 --> 34:31.623
<i>Get the fuck out of this fucking room</i>

34:31.693 --> 34:32.717
<i>and think about
something else, okay?</i>

34:32.793 --> 34:33.726
<i>Anything.</i>

34:33.795 --> 34:35.820
<i>Just... think about Sam, okay?</i>

34:35.897 --> 34:37.558
<i>Just get back to Sam.</i>

34:37.632 --> 34:40.498
<i>Just... Sam, help me!</i>

34:40.569 --> 34:42.230
Ready?

34:42.304 --> 34:44.168
<i>- That's it!
- Come on.</i>

34:44.239 --> 34:45.501
That's it. Just focus on her.

34:45.574 --> 34:47.632
<i>Just focus on her.</i>

34:47.708 --> 34:49.370
<i>Just forget about the pain.</i>

34:49.444 --> 34:51.002
<i>Okay, Puttnam, take it. You got it.</i>

34:51.079 --> 34:53.206
<i>Clay, just remember.</i>

34:53.281 --> 34:56.478
<i>Remember everything.
Every detail.</i>

34:56.551 --> 34:58.485
Wow! Hey!

34:58.553 --> 34:59.713
<i>That's right. That's it.</i>

34:59.788 --> 35:00.982
The place used to be a speakeasy.

35:01.056 --> 35:02.284
No, you didn't...

35:02.357 --> 35:03.517
<i>Just focus.</i>

35:03.592 --> 35:05.560
<i>Focus on her.</i>

35:05.627 --> 35:06.753
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

35:06.828 --> 35:09.296
<i>What?</i>

35:09.364 --> 35:10.922
<i>What? No.</i>

35:10.999 --> 35:12.261
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

35:12.334 --> 35:15.895
- of the Lord to lay
Clayton Beresford to rest.

35:15.971 --> 35:17.563
<i>Come on, Clay, concentrate!</i>

35:17.639 --> 35:18.936
<i>Remember something else.</i>

35:19.007 --> 35:19.939
<i>Clayton?</i>

35:20.008 --> 35:21.976
- and a loving father.

35:22.043 --> 35:23.704
Clayton?

35:23.778 --> 35:25.439
Clayton, are you paying attention?

35:25.514 --> 35:27.846
If it is made manifest by the third...

35:27.916 --> 35:29.008
<i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

35:29.084 --> 35:30.016
<i>Forget about them, all right?</i>

35:30.085 --> 35:31.382
<i>They can't help you now.</i>

35:31.453 --> 35:33.580
<i>To the newest hot shot on the Street,</i>

35:33.655 --> 35:35.213
<i>his father's son...</i>

35:35.290 --> 35:36.279
<i>No, Clay! Fuck!</i>

35:36.358 --> 35:37.620
<i>Get back to Sam.</i>

35:37.692 --> 35:40.217
Okay, we have a massive
heart attack, possible M. I.

35:40.295 --> 35:41.922
<i>Come on, Jack. Get me back to Sam.</i>

35:41.997 --> 35:42.929
What's his name?

35:42.998 --> 35:44.932
<i>I need your help.</i>

35:45.000 --> 35:47.468
Stay with my voice, pal.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.470
You're gonna be fine, okay?

35:49.538 --> 35:50.903
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

35:50.972 --> 35:52.872
<i>What the fuck?</i>

35:52.941 --> 35:55.102
Okay, open him up nice and wide.

35:55.176 --> 35:56.666
<i>Okay, it's happening again.</i>

35:56.745 --> 35:57.677
<i>Okay, it's fine.</i>

35:57.746 --> 35:58.735
<i>Just control it like before.</i>

35:58.813 --> 36:00.041
<i>You can do this.</i>

36:00.115 --> 36:02.140
<i>Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.</i>

36:02.217 --> 36:03.650
<i>Come on, man, just swallow it.</i>

36:06.421 --> 36:07.820
Hey, follow my voice, pal.

36:07.889 --> 36:10.619
We got you.
Stay right with me, okay?

36:13.361 --> 36:14.589
There goes a rib.

36:14.663 --> 36:16.824
Oh, that's going to hurt tomorrow.

36:16.898 --> 36:18.729
<i>Sorry, Clay.</i>

36:18.800 --> 36:20.768
<i>Yeah, you better be fucking sorry.</i>

36:20.835 --> 36:22.462
<i>Fucking asshole.</i>

36:22.537 --> 36:23.469
<i>Okay, it's over.</i>

36:23.538 --> 36:24.732
<i>They're... They're through.</i>

36:24.806 --> 36:26.637
<i>They're all the way in now.</i>

36:26.708 --> 36:28.300
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

36:28.376 --> 36:31.106
<i>Just relax. The worst is over.</i>

36:31.179 --> 36:33.579
<i>Jack's got you.</i>

36:33.648 --> 36:35.411
<i>He... He's going to take care
of you, all right?</i>

36:35.483 --> 36:36.609
<i>Just like he always does.</i>

36:36.685 --> 36:37.743
Have a seat.

36:37.819 --> 36:39.980
<i>Let him help you, Clay.</i>

36:40.055 --> 36:41.818
...I kind of like to do
a follow-up with someone

36:41.890 --> 36:43.084
after I've saved their life.

36:43.158 --> 36:45.217
You don't feel grateful
or anything, do you?

36:45.293 --> 36:46.590
<i>Get me to Sam, Jack.</i>

36:46.661 --> 36:48.458
We're going to need a transplant.

36:48.530 --> 36:50.191
You tell me. You're the doctor.

36:50.265 --> 36:52.165
You do much fishing?

36:52.233 --> 36:53.598
What do you do as a billionaire?

36:53.668 --> 36:55.192
You just sit around and eat shrimp?

36:55.270 --> 36:57.067
<i>- You always keep your cell on...
- There she is.</i>

36:57.138 --> 36:58.196
...and that would be it.

36:58.273 --> 36:59.535
<i>- Okay.
- Sound like fun?</i>

36:59.608 --> 37:01.473
<i>You did it, Clay. You're back.</i>

37:01.543 --> 37:03.067
Oh, and that'd be Clay.

37:03.144 --> 37:04.873
<i>- Awful table manners, always late.
- Look at me.</i>

37:04.946 --> 37:07.471
<i>- You'll get used to it.
- Look at me.</i>

37:10.385 --> 37:12.649
Oh! Holy shit, I'm sorry.

37:12.721 --> 37:14.313
I...

37:16.224 --> 37:17.156
This is embarrassing.

37:17.225 --> 37:18.522
I thought you were
at your office...

37:18.593 --> 37:20.618
<i>- I need your help, Sam.
- I came in to, um...</i>

37:20.695 --> 37:22.788
<i>I need a place to hide, okay?</i>

37:22.864 --> 37:25.094
So, nice to meet you, too.

37:25.166 --> 37:26.633
My name's Sam.

37:26.701 --> 37:28.532
<i>There we go, Clay.</i>

37:28.603 --> 37:29.661
<i>You see?</i>

37:29.738 --> 37:31.797
<i>Just let her take you away.</i>

37:31.873 --> 37:34.068
<i>Go all the way back to the beginning.</i>

37:34.142 --> 37:37.669
We are going to where
the other half lives.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.504
Let me guess,

37:40.582 --> 37:42.948
never been on the subway before.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.153
No.

37:47.222 --> 37:49.213
Never been to Brooklyn, either?

37:50.792 --> 37:53.522
- To be perfectly honest, never.
- Wow.

37:53.595 --> 37:57.691
Oh, you really shouldn't
be smoking these things.

37:57.766 --> 38:00.929
<i>- I'll be with you soon, Sam.
- It's not good for you.</i>

38:01.002 --> 38:05.200
<i>No matter what happens,
I'll be with you soon.</i>

38:08.777 --> 38:12.804
Miss, um... Ramos?

38:12.881 --> 38:15.782
We're ready for you. Room 5.

38:15.850 --> 38:18.148
Right down the end of the hall,
on your right.

38:18.219 --> 38:20.119
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

38:27.195 --> 38:28.890
Hi. How are you doing?

38:28.963 --> 38:29.952
Hey.

38:30.031 --> 38:32.090
Can I help you with something?

38:34.969 --> 38:37.597
Haven't I... seen you around?

38:41.409 --> 38:44.242
Guess not.

38:44.312 --> 38:46.405
Sorry.

38:47.549 --> 38:50.017
You have two rings on your finger.

38:50.085 --> 38:51.814
What was that?

38:51.886 --> 38:55.652
Why are you wearing two rings, Sam?

38:59.294 --> 39:01.159
When?

39:01.229 --> 39:03.789
Just before he got the call.

39:07.469 --> 39:08.458
Lilith...

39:14.709 --> 39:17.269
Who needs all
those extra nurses, anyway, huh?

39:17.345 --> 39:18.835
Well, I'm sick of the cutbacks.

39:18.913 --> 39:21.143
I mean, how can they ask us
to do this with five people?

39:21.216 --> 39:23.184
Yeah. You want to clamp that?

39:24.953 --> 39:26.318
Ah, that's good Miss Chen.

39:26.387 --> 39:27.547
Heart came early.

39:27.622 --> 39:30.147
Yeah, there she is.

39:30.225 --> 39:31.749
Thanks, Penny.

39:31.826 --> 39:33.054
Clear.

39:33.128 --> 39:35.596
Look at her. She's a beauty.

39:35.663 --> 39:37.130
He's a lucky man.

39:37.198 --> 39:39.098
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets

39:39.167 --> 39:41.863
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.

39:41.936 --> 39:43.426
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.

39:43.505 --> 39:45.439
What, is it
too American for you?

39:45.507 --> 39:48.169
<i>We're halfway home, Sam.</i>

39:49.177 --> 39:50.235
See where you live?

39:50.311 --> 39:51.835
<i>The new heart's already here.</i>

39:51.913 --> 39:53.904
That's you. Right there.

39:53.982 --> 39:55.779
<i>They're gonna put it in soon.</i>

39:55.850 --> 39:57.943
Not that far away from
each other after all,

39:58.019 --> 39:59.953
are we Clay?

40:00.021 --> 40:03.548
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

40:03.625 --> 40:07.721
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

40:07.796 --> 40:10.026
Stay with me.

40:11.499 --> 40:14.127
Just stay.

40:14.202 --> 40:17.194
<i>We're almost there, Sam.</i>

40:17.272 --> 40:20.264
<i>We're almost there.</i>

40:21.609 --> 40:23.042
How are we doin', Penny?

40:23.111 --> 40:25.409
He's looking good. He's stable.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.072
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?

40:27.148 --> 40:28.775
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.

40:28.850 --> 40:30.818
I hate the Knicks.

40:30.885 --> 40:32.284
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?

40:32.353 --> 40:33.581
I got third row.

40:34.622 --> 40:36.522
Oh, shit.

40:40.595 --> 40:44.759
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.965
He likes me to carry them around.

40:49.037 --> 40:52.131
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.

40:52.207 --> 40:54.607
He could OD on
these things, you know?

40:54.676 --> 40:56.507
Can't say I'll miss them.

40:56.578 --> 41:00.605
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.

41:03.718 --> 41:05.777
I didn't know you did that,

41:05.854 --> 41:09.221
that you carried his meds around.

41:14.128 --> 41:16.426
I tried not to like him.

41:16.497 --> 41:20.126
I honestly did.

41:20.201 --> 41:23.068
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.

41:23.137 --> 41:26.265
What do you want from me, Sam?

41:26.341 --> 41:30.744
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.

41:30.812 --> 41:35.442
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,

41:35.516 --> 41:38.576
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.

41:41.155 --> 41:45.421
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.

41:45.493 --> 41:47.120
He needs you.

41:47.195 --> 41:50.653
I'm not a bad person.

41:50.732 --> 41:52.131
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...

41:52.200 --> 41:56.694
Okay, just stop talking.

41:58.039 --> 42:01.634
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...

42:01.709 --> 42:03.609
stop talking.

42:03.678 --> 42:05.612
What?

42:05.680 --> 42:07.238
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?

42:07.315 --> 42:08.907
Especially in the spring.

42:08.983 --> 42:12.419
Grass and flowers...

42:12.487 --> 42:15.115
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.

42:17.191 --> 42:19.625
Okay. Okay, let go.

42:19.694 --> 42:23.630
All right.

42:23.698 --> 42:26.292
Still sleeping like a baby.

42:26.367 --> 42:28.801
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?

42:28.870 --> 42:30.929
We've been at this for a while.

42:31.005 --> 42:34.031
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.

42:34.108 --> 42:36.668
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.

42:36.744 --> 42:38.905
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.

42:38.980 --> 42:39.947
We don't need you for a while.

42:40.014 --> 42:40.946
Well, thanks, guys.

42:41.015 --> 42:41.947
Sure.

42:42.016 --> 42:43.108
Thanks a lot.

42:43.184 --> 42:45.448
Pickups. Need adrenaline.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.748
Peanut.

42:46.821 --> 42:49.381
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,

42:49.457 --> 42:52.255
to the game...

42:52.327 --> 42:54.158
Thanks, Larry.

43:03.471 --> 43:05.268
Jack?

43:05.340 --> 43:07.808
What's the matter?
You all right?

43:10.278 --> 43:13.304
I don't know if I can do this.

43:13.381 --> 43:15.281
What is the problem?

43:15.350 --> 43:16.442
Fitzpatrick is the problem.

43:16.517 --> 43:18.348
He screwed us.

43:18.419 --> 43:20.979
This guy's been watching everything I do.

43:21.055 --> 43:22.784
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.

43:22.857 --> 43:24.324
He doesn't know
what's going on here.

43:24.392 --> 43:25.984
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.

43:26.060 --> 43:28.392
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.

43:28.463 --> 43:29.395
<i>What?</i>

43:29.464 --> 43:30.726
Did you smell his breath, Jack?

43:30.798 --> 43:32.129
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.395
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...

43:34.469 --> 43:36.403
Hey, would you just be quiet?

43:36.471 --> 43:37.403
He could be back any second.

43:37.472 --> 43:38.803
Okay, then go stand guard.

43:38.873 --> 43:41.740
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...

43:43.144 --> 43:46.011
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.

43:46.080 --> 43:48.014
No one knows.

43:48.082 --> 43:50.073
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.

43:50.151 --> 43:51.516
I am not going to jail.

43:51.586 --> 43:53.110
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

43:53.187 --> 43:54.711
No one's going to jail.

43:54.789 --> 43:57.417
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,

43:57.492 --> 43:58.516
and end this thing, okay?

43:58.593 --> 43:59.958
<i>What the fuck?</i>

44:00.028 --> 44:01.256
Nobody's on to anything.

44:01.329 --> 44:02.956
We are in... the... clear.

44:03.031 --> 44:04.658
We're gonna kill this guy,

44:04.732 --> 44:06.700
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?

44:06.768 --> 44:09.066
By the time Larry walks back in here,

44:09.137 --> 44:11.105
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.

44:11.172 --> 44:12.764
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

44:12.840 --> 44:14.171
He knows something's going on.

44:14.242 --> 44:15.937
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.

44:16.010 --> 44:17.500
You get no arguments there.

44:17.578 --> 44:18.772
<i>You gotta stand up.</i>

44:18.846 --> 44:21.576
<i>You gotta stand up, Clay.</i>

44:21.649 --> 44:24.277
<i>Take the tape off your eyes
and shit out of your throat,</i>

44:24.352 --> 44:25.478
<i>and wake up.</i>

44:25.553 --> 44:26.952
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.

44:27.021 --> 44:28.852
<i>That's it, there you go.</i>

44:28.923 --> 44:30.390
<i>You can do it.</i>

44:30.458 --> 44:33.052
<i>Just open your eyes, Clay.</i>

44:33.127 --> 44:36.187
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

44:56.184 --> 44:58.516
I'm not doing this by myself.

45:00.088 --> 45:02.022
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,

45:02.090 --> 45:04.183
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,

45:04.258 --> 45:06.920
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.

45:06.994 --> 45:08.086
I'm not kidding, Eugene.

45:08.162 --> 45:09.720
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?

45:11.132 --> 45:12.497
I'm too young to go to jail right now.

45:12.567 --> 45:14.330
This ain't even worth it.

45:14.402 --> 45:15.369
We're fine, Jack...

45:16.938 --> 45:18.132
<i>All right, now think.</i>

45:18.206 --> 45:21.403
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

45:21.476 --> 45:22.943
there are in this country?

45:23.010 --> 45:23.977
<i>Think, Clay.</i>

45:24.045 --> 45:25.273
Hard-working doctors, that's just...

45:25.346 --> 45:26.938
<i>Look closer.</i>

45:27.014 --> 45:28.606
You know how many I got?

45:28.683 --> 45:29.843
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.

45:29.917 --> 45:30.941
<i>There's gotta be a way out of this.</i>

45:31.018 --> 45:32.485
All for trying to
save people's lives.

45:32.553 --> 45:34.020
It's a disgrace.

45:34.088 --> 45:36.420
<i>You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.</i>

45:38.326 --> 45:40.294
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

45:40.361 --> 45:43.023
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.

45:43.097 --> 45:45.725
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

45:45.800 --> 45:48.200
Mm-hmm.

45:49.303 --> 45:52.568
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.629
- Yeah.
- Okay?

45:53.708 --> 45:55.539
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

45:58.346 --> 46:00.371
Hi. Excuse me.

46:00.448 --> 46:02.177
I was wondering
if you knew the status

46:02.250 --> 46:04.343
on the heart transplant patient?

46:04.418 --> 46:06.545
Mr. Beresford?

46:06.621 --> 46:07.553
Yeah.

46:07.622 --> 46:09.214
I'll call you back.

46:09.290 --> 46:11.281
He's doing just fine.

46:11.359 --> 46:12.656
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.

46:12.727 --> 46:15.025
Everything's going according to plan.

46:16.464 --> 46:19.024
Really?
I just came from there.

46:20.868 --> 46:22.335
What is it?

46:22.403 --> 46:24.735
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

46:24.805 --> 46:29.105
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

46:29.177 --> 46:31.441
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.739
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.

46:35.917 --> 46:38.010
Will you excuse me a minute?

46:42.123 --> 46:45.581
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.

46:45.660 --> 46:47.184
Oh.

46:47.261 --> 46:48.626
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.

46:48.696 --> 46:51.529
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.

46:51.599 --> 46:53.897
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

46:53.968 --> 46:57.404
God, look how fucking obvious.

46:58.506 --> 47:00.030
I understand.

47:00.107 --> 47:01.768
This is Dr. Puttnam.

47:01.842 --> 47:04.140
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?

47:04.212 --> 47:05.577
Okay.

47:07.014 --> 47:08.072
Everything all right?

47:08.149 --> 47:10.310
I don't get it, Jack.

47:10.384 --> 47:13.217
Why?

47:20.261 --> 47:22.161
Is she asleep?

47:22.230 --> 47:24.494
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

47:24.565 --> 47:26.590
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,

47:26.667 --> 47:28.362
and tell her I'll be home soon.

47:28.436 --> 47:30.700
Good. Thanks.

47:31.739 --> 47:32.865
Say that again.

47:32.940 --> 47:33.872
Wife!

47:33.941 --> 47:36.705
What'd I ever do to you?

47:38.012 --> 47:40.480
What did she do to you?

47:40.548 --> 47:42.880
Huh?

47:42.950 --> 47:45.248
How the fuck
could you do this to us?

47:45.319 --> 47:46.479
What are you doing in here?

47:46.554 --> 47:49.318
I wanted to see how it was going.

47:51.325 --> 47:53.316
Sam.

47:54.428 --> 47:57.124
How's it going? Is everything okay?

47:57.198 --> 47:58.290
Yeah.

47:58.366 --> 48:01.267
Sam.

48:01.335 --> 48:02.700
They're trying to kill me.

48:02.770 --> 48:05.739
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.

48:05.806 --> 48:07.774
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.

48:07.842 --> 48:11.369
No, don't trust him, baby.

48:11.445 --> 48:12.912
He's lying to you.

48:12.980 --> 48:14.379
Are you sure everything's fine?

48:14.448 --> 48:16.939
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.

48:17.018 --> 48:18.542
Bullshit.

48:18.619 --> 48:19.916
What the hell's going on in here?

48:19.987 --> 48:21.420
That's right. Come on, baby.

48:21.489 --> 48:23.423
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?

48:23.491 --> 48:26.051
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.

48:26.127 --> 48:28.721
What do you mean, he's at home?

48:28.796 --> 48:30.286
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?

48:30.364 --> 48:32.298
What?

48:32.366 --> 48:33.298
He can't back out.

48:33.367 --> 48:34.891
Do you want me to call him back?

48:34.969 --> 48:36.527
No, he's an idiot.

48:36.604 --> 48:39.300
We'll deal with him later.

48:39.373 --> 48:41.898
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?

48:41.976 --> 48:43.841
None. What about her?

48:43.911 --> 48:45.105
Are you kidding?

48:45.179 --> 48:47.204
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.

48:52.153 --> 48:54.280
Everything is fine, right?

48:54.355 --> 48:57.483
Right?

48:58.893 --> 49:02.659
Jack, you okay?

49:04.198 --> 49:06.894
Jack?

49:08.836 --> 49:09.768
Get her a gown.

49:09.837 --> 49:11.065
What about Larry?

49:11.138 --> 49:13.732
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.

49:18.145 --> 49:20.113
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.

49:27.788 --> 49:30.279
Jack.

49:30.358 --> 49:34.260
It was my idea, Sam. You know?

49:34.328 --> 49:36.262
Jesus.

49:36.330 --> 49:39.390
I can pull the plug if I want to.

49:39.467 --> 49:42.334
Everything is working, Jack.

49:42.403 --> 49:44.030
Okay?

49:44.105 --> 49:45.163
There he is.

49:45.239 --> 49:47.730
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.

49:47.808 --> 49:49.298
The hard part's over.

49:49.377 --> 49:51.538
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.

49:51.612 --> 49:53.045
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.

49:54.315 --> 49:56.306
<i>Christ, they know her.</i>

49:56.384 --> 49:59.012
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.

49:59.086 --> 50:00.917
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.

50:00.988 --> 50:02.580
Nice to meet you, too.

50:02.656 --> 50:04.419
Sorry about him.

50:04.492 --> 50:05.891
I'm used to it by now.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.757
So...

50:07.828 --> 50:11.355
How the hell do they all know her?

50:11.432 --> 50:13.662
We didn't waste a year of our lives

50:13.734 --> 50:16.601
for nothing, did we, Jack?

50:16.670 --> 50:18.103
Nobody knows I worked your team.

50:18.172 --> 50:19.139
<i>What?</i>

50:19.206 --> 50:21.003
I changed my name.

50:21.075 --> 50:23.635
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.

50:23.711 --> 50:26.111
Yeah, they're all mine.

50:26.180 --> 50:30.708
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.

50:30.785 --> 50:32.616
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.

50:32.686 --> 50:35.621
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.

50:35.689 --> 50:38.590
The insurance won't cover it.

50:38.659 --> 50:41.526
I can't just kill him, Sam.

50:41.595 --> 50:44.496
This is our only way out.

50:46.200 --> 50:49.931
Without this money, we're finished.

50:50.004 --> 50:52.700
He has to die.

50:52.773 --> 50:55.003
I am fucked.

50:55.075 --> 50:56.633
It's just money, Sam.

50:56.710 --> 50:59.543
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.

50:59.613 --> 51:00.580
Jesus, Jack.

51:00.648 --> 51:02.741
Grow some fucking balls.

51:02.817 --> 51:05.377
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?

51:05.453 --> 51:08.183
He landed on my table, I brought you in,

51:08.255 --> 51:09.688
I brought all y'all in.

51:09.757 --> 51:12.920
It's my choice.

51:12.993 --> 51:15.928
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?

51:15.996 --> 51:17.122
He's right, you know.

51:17.198 --> 51:19.063
I would've had that ring on my finger

51:19.133 --> 51:20.065
in two months.

51:20.134 --> 51:21.533
Really?

51:21.602 --> 51:22.796
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,

51:22.870 --> 51:25.134
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?

51:25.206 --> 51:27.902
Just go, Penny, all right?

51:30.811 --> 51:34.212
Jack, think about it.

51:34.281 --> 51:39.275
No more triple shifts.

51:39.353 --> 51:42.379
No more 30-hour days.

51:42.456 --> 51:46.688
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.389
You know what
100 million is four ways?

51:52.433 --> 51:56.233
He's a transplant patient, Jack.

51:56.303 --> 51:58.737
They all die eventually.

51:58.806 --> 52:02.207
Yeah.

52:02.276 --> 52:04.710
They all die eventually.

52:13.153 --> 52:14.780
Look at me.

52:14.855 --> 52:16.720
This isn't about her.

52:16.790 --> 52:18.553
I'm so sorry.

52:18.626 --> 52:21.493
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

52:21.562 --> 52:24.258
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.

52:24.331 --> 52:26.993
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.

52:28.636 --> 52:30.695
Quickly. Watch the vein.

52:30.771 --> 52:33.205
All right, it's almost there.

52:33.274 --> 52:35.299
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

52:39.179 --> 52:40.771
I got it.

52:40.848 --> 52:42.213
All right, I need some suction.

52:42.283 --> 52:44.751
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.

52:44.818 --> 52:47.616
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.

52:47.688 --> 52:49.519
Oh, no, please, God.

52:49.590 --> 52:51.387
No.

52:52.393 --> 52:56.022
Aah!

52:56.096 --> 52:57.791
It's right here.

52:57.865 --> 52:59.457
Thank you.

53:00.634 --> 53:02.158
You sure Larry's not close?

53:02.236 --> 53:03.601
We're fine. Don't worry.

53:03.671 --> 53:04.968
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?

53:05.039 --> 53:06.506
Let's just keep it moving.

53:06.574 --> 53:08.838
All right, just pass over the new heart.

53:08.909 --> 53:09.841
What?

53:09.910 --> 53:11.138
Pass over the new heart.

53:11.211 --> 53:12.838
But we haven't injected it yet.

53:12.913 --> 53:15.404
Pass it over.

53:15.482 --> 53:17.507
What are you doing?

53:17.585 --> 53:19.644
Where's the syringe?

53:19.720 --> 53:20.880
Give it to me.

53:20.955 --> 53:22.149
Come on.

53:22.222 --> 53:24.782
Move your fucking hand.

53:24.858 --> 53:28.624
Now, I want you to take this.

53:29.863 --> 53:34.300
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?

53:37.805 --> 53:40.103
You led us here.

53:40.174 --> 53:42.642
Finish what you started.

53:42.710 --> 53:44.610
Just do it, Jack.

53:44.678 --> 53:46.612
Let's get this over with.

53:48.916 --> 53:51.646
Sorry, baby.

53:54.254 --> 53:55.881
He really loved you, Sam.

53:55.956 --> 53:59.221
He didn't even know me, Jack.

53:59.293 --> 54:01.318
We never even met.

54:07.768 --> 54:11.363
Wait. Hold on.

54:14.575 --> 54:16.406
Holy shit.

54:16.477 --> 54:19.446
Oh, holy shit.

54:41.602 --> 54:42.899
Is he okay?

54:42.970 --> 54:45.234
Is everything okay?

54:45.305 --> 54:47.432
They wouldn't say.

54:47.508 --> 54:49.066
You were gone so long.

54:49.143 --> 54:50.075
- I know.
- I started...

54:50.144 --> 54:51.941
I know.

54:52.012 --> 54:54.674
I'm scared, too.

55:03.791 --> 55:06.123
Hey, guys.

55:06.193 --> 55:07.558
Survive without me?

55:07.628 --> 55:09.960
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.

55:11.699 --> 55:13.098
Forceps.

55:13.167 --> 55:14.998
Oh, you guys are flying.

55:15.069 --> 55:16.627
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.

55:17.938 --> 55:19.929
Larry. Larry, Larry.

55:20.007 --> 55:22.771
Look at my eye.

55:22.843 --> 55:25.812
Come on, man. Can you see that?

55:25.879 --> 55:27.779
Why am I crying, huh?

55:27.848 --> 55:29.577
Something's wrong.

55:29.650 --> 55:32.778
Larry. Larry, look.

55:32.853 --> 55:35.447
Come on, man. Look at my eye.

55:35.522 --> 55:37.319
Come on, Larry, look!

55:38.992 --> 55:41.620
Pull it back so I can see...

55:43.397 --> 55:46.264
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.

55:46.333 --> 55:49.234
- Okay.
- Clamp that.

55:49.303 --> 55:51.965
- Get me the suction.
- All right.

55:52.039 --> 55:54.234
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:54.308 --> 55:56.538
Hold on. Hold on.

56:00.347 --> 56:03.475
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.

56:03.550 --> 56:06.383
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.

56:06.453 --> 56:08.387
My old lady and I have a date.

56:12.226 --> 56:14.285
You f...

56:17.598 --> 56:19.657
Why don't I give you both tickets?

56:19.733 --> 56:21.360
- Really?
- Sure.

56:21.435 --> 56:22.493
You can take your old lady.

56:22.569 --> 56:24.196
Make a night of it, go out on the town.

56:26.774 --> 56:29.641
Something's wrong.

56:29.710 --> 56:31.701
I can feel that something's wrong.

56:31.779 --> 56:33.406
What is it?

56:33.480 --> 56:34.913
I can't just sit here like this.

56:34.982 --> 56:38.145
They should have told us something by now.

56:38.218 --> 56:40.709
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.

56:40.788 --> 56:42.449
He's not just my son.

56:42.523 --> 56:44.184
I was a kid when I had him.

56:44.258 --> 56:45.623
He's going to be fine.

56:45.692 --> 56:48.820
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.

56:48.896 --> 56:50.693
He's not going to die.

56:50.764 --> 56:54.791
Not now, not today.

56:54.868 --> 56:56.199
He's going to live.

56:56.270 --> 56:58.500
How can you be so sure?

56:58.572 --> 57:01.166
Because he's got too much to live for.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.775
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

57:08.849 --> 57:10.544
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

57:10.617 --> 57:12.141
What's wrong with right now?

57:12.219 --> 57:13.652
Well, I can't. I'm...

57:13.720 --> 57:17.918
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

57:17.991 --> 57:19.788
You look beautiful, Sam.

57:19.860 --> 57:21.327
<i>- I do?
- Look at you.</i>

57:21.395 --> 57:22.362
Yeah, you do.

57:22.429 --> 57:23.896
I should tell you that more often.

57:23.964 --> 57:26.660
<i>What would the old man
think of you now?</i>

57:28.468 --> 57:31.437
<i>You lost it all, Clay.</i>

57:31.505 --> 57:35.669
<i>Everything he gave you, everything he made,</i>

57:35.742 --> 57:37.505
<i>it's gone.</i>

57:39.046 --> 57:41.537
<i>You gave it all away.</i>

57:41.615 --> 57:43.742
Heart's in.

57:43.817 --> 57:46.308
All right, pressure down.

57:46.386 --> 57:47.751
Pressure down.

57:47.821 --> 57:50.449
Okay, release the clamp.

57:50.524 --> 57:53.254
Cross-clamp released.

57:54.561 --> 57:56.188
Wait a minute.

57:57.331 --> 57:58.389
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.

57:58.465 --> 58:02.265
Okay, re... re-clamp.

58:02.336 --> 58:03.598
He's... He's fibbing.

58:03.670 --> 58:05.103
You getting anything?

58:05.172 --> 58:06.969
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.668
Charge paddles n... now.

58:09.743 --> 58:11.267
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.

58:11.345 --> 58:15.907
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.

58:15.983 --> 58:18.383
It's not good for you.

58:18.452 --> 58:20.215
Especially with your condition.

58:20.287 --> 58:24.053
- My condition?
- Yep.

58:24.124 --> 58:25.591
How do you know
about my condition?

58:25.659 --> 58:27.388
<i>So many details.</i>

58:27.461 --> 58:29.554
I know a lot more
about you than you think.

58:29.630 --> 58:32.428
<i>- I didn't even see.
- Is that a fact?</i>

58:32.499 --> 58:33.932
Of course.

58:34.001 --> 58:36.765
<i>Christ, I missed everything.</i>

58:36.837 --> 58:40.398
<i>What was I looking at?</i>

58:40.474 --> 58:43.409
Was I looking at you?

58:43.477 --> 58:46.446
I hope you're happy, Sam.

58:46.513 --> 58:48.743
And I hope you get what you deserve.

58:48.815 --> 58:50.840
Got nothing?

58:50.918 --> 58:54.319
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.

58:54.388 --> 58:56.151
- Amio's running.
- Charge.

58:56.223 --> 58:58.657
Charge it again.

58:58.725 --> 59:00.158
Charge.

59:00.227 --> 59:02.923
Are your lats okay?

59:02.996 --> 59:04.327
Charge it to 40, please.

59:04.398 --> 59:05.592
- Jack.
- Jesus.

59:05.666 --> 59:07.861
Charge it one more time, please.

59:07.935 --> 59:09.232
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

59:09.303 --> 59:11.771
Just charge it one more time.

59:11.838 --> 59:13.430
Charge.

59:13.507 --> 59:15.998
Marry me.

59:16.076 --> 59:17.134
What?

59:17.210 --> 59:19.542
<i>- Here we go.
- Tonight. Right now.</i>

59:19.613 --> 59:21.672
- Marry me.
- It's the middle of the night.

59:25.752 --> 59:27.811
We're losing him.

59:27.888 --> 59:29.822
We gotta get him back on bypass.

59:29.890 --> 59:30.822
No, no, no, not yet.

59:30.891 --> 59:33.086
Just one more time.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.889
It's over, Jack. He's done.

59:34.962 --> 59:36.020
We have to put him back on...

59:36.096 --> 59:37.654
What about the adrenaline?

59:37.731 --> 59:38.857
It won't make a difference.

59:38.932 --> 59:41.264
A shot of adrenaline, please.

59:41.335 --> 59:43.360
Please!

59:45.138 --> 59:47.971
Come on, you son of a bitch.

59:48.041 --> 59:49.133
Jack.

59:49.209 --> 59:50.403
- Sure there's no air?
- No air.

59:50.477 --> 59:51.876
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.

59:51.945 --> 59:53.742
It's over, Jack.

59:56.083 --> 59:57.641
Shit.

59:57.718 --> 59:59.811
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:00:01.855 --> 01:00:03.823
It's my fault.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.551
No.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:07.092
It's my fault.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.525
Jack, come on.

01:00:08.595 --> 01:00:11.723
No, it is. It's...

01:00:11.798 --> 01:00:14.858
There's gotta be
something I could have done,

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:16.732
something I could have tried.

01:00:16.803 --> 01:00:19.738
Jack, you did everything
you could do.

01:00:19.806 --> 01:00:22.036
Did I?

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:24.669
You did all you could do, Jack.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:27.270
It was a bad heart.

01:00:35.555 --> 01:00:37.716
We should tell the family.

01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:40.482
Any volunteers?

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.289
I'll do it.

01:00:42.362 --> 01:00:44.853
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.

01:00:50.103 --> 01:00:51.934
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.

01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:54.064
Thank you.

01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:07.583
So?

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:09.144
He rejected the heart.

01:01:11.258 --> 01:01:14.250
We did everything
we could, but the...

01:01:14.327 --> 01:01:17.160
the organ failed, and I am so sorry.

01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:23.768
The organ failed?

01:01:23.837 --> 01:01:27.534
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.

01:01:27.607 --> 01:01:30.098
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...

01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:33.340
Don't you mean you failed?

01:01:33.413 --> 01:01:35.404
No, we...

01:01:35.482 --> 01:01:38.007
we did everything that we could.

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:40.110
It's just an imperfect procedure.

01:01:40.187 --> 01:01:42.417
Say it.

01:01:42.489 --> 01:01:43.956
Say what?

01:01:44.024 --> 01:01:47.585
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...

01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:50.289
you failed my son.

01:01:55.168 --> 01:01:57.136
It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.

01:01:57.204 --> 01:02:00.367
I fucking knew it.

01:02:02.042 --> 01:02:05.534
I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.

01:02:10.984 --> 01:02:14.010
Um...

01:02:14.087 --> 01:02:15.679
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission

01:02:15.755 --> 01:02:17.086
to take him off bypass.

01:02:18.825 --> 01:02:20.793
What?

01:02:20.861 --> 01:02:22.988
We'll need your permission.

01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:25.964
I'm so sorry to have to ask.

01:02:26.032 --> 01:02:27.932
I don't understand.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:31.628
He's alive?

01:02:31.705 --> 01:02:35.801
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.

01:02:35.876 --> 01:02:36.808
He has no heart.

01:02:36.877 --> 01:02:38.902
Then get him another heart.

01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:39.946
You don't understand.

01:02:40.013 --> 01:02:42.311
His blood type's too rare.

01:02:42.382 --> 01:02:43.440
We don't have one.

01:02:46.753 --> 01:02:50.689
I'm sorry. It's... It's over.

01:02:50.757 --> 01:02:52.554
Thank you.

01:03:01.902 --> 01:03:05.133
I'll be in the hallway.

01:03:08.608 --> 01:03:10.838
Lilith...

01:03:10.911 --> 01:03:13.106
Could you leave me
alone for a minute?

01:03:14.214 --> 01:03:15.681
Okay.

01:03:35.702 --> 01:03:37.602
It's done.

01:03:44.878 --> 01:03:45.867
Okay.

01:04:42.335 --> 01:04:43.461
Hey.

01:04:43.536 --> 01:04:44.696
Hey.

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:48.641
What are you doing?

01:04:52.479 --> 01:04:54.037
Hey.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:59.416
Just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

01:04:59.486 --> 01:05:03.422
Wanted to see how you were doing.

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:07.551
I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...

01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:12.096
Are you okay?

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.658
You okay?

01:05:25.612 --> 01:05:26.977
What are you doing here?

01:05:27.047 --> 01:05:29.379
I wasn't staying
out there without you.

01:05:34.254 --> 01:05:36.051
She's in here somewhere.

01:05:36.122 --> 01:05:37.919
Look around.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:46.194
God damn it.

01:05:46.266 --> 01:05:47.790
Bailey, call the code.

01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:49.630
It's too late.

01:05:55.175 --> 01:05:56.733
All right,
let's prep her for surgery.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.314
I don't understand.

01:06:02.382 --> 01:06:05.408
You're going to live, Clay.

01:06:05.485 --> 01:06:09.683
Think I'll take it from here, Jack.

01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:10.882
It's too late.

01:06:12.726 --> 01:06:15.752
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.

01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:18.093
Well, I think we solved that problem.

01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:22.693
I have a strong heart, Clay.

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:23.861
Let's go.

01:06:23.937 --> 01:06:25.996
Let's prep her for transplant.

01:06:26.072 --> 01:06:28.768
Always have.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.548
You can go.
We've been prepped.

01:06:35.615 --> 01:06:36.843
What do you mean?

01:06:36.916 --> 01:06:38.406
You can run.

01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:40.180
Police will be here soon.

01:06:41.554 --> 01:06:43.112
What'd you use, Jack?

01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:46.283
Formaldehy... No, wait.

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:47.451
Adriamycin.

01:06:47.527 --> 01:06:49.290
Right.

01:06:49.362 --> 01:06:52.160
Less residue.

01:06:52.232 --> 01:06:54.029
Guys.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.567
Jack, come on. Let's go.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:58.662
Jack, what are you doing?

01:06:58.738 --> 01:07:01.104
Let's go. Now, Jack.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.301
What the hell happened to you?

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:15.182
I told you not to trust them.

01:07:15.255 --> 01:07:16.313
I don't get it.

01:07:16.389 --> 01:07:17.856
You're telling me that you knew?

01:07:17.924 --> 01:07:21.416
No, no. Not at first.

01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:24.622
I had no idea.

01:07:24.697 --> 01:07:27.564
She did everything right.

01:07:27.634 --> 01:07:32.196
And then, she made one little mistake.

01:07:32.272 --> 01:07:34.433
She left her purse in the waiting room.

01:07:34.507 --> 01:07:37.408
Forget ethics.

01:07:37.477 --> 01:07:39.001
You got five minutes.

01:07:39.078 --> 01:07:40.443
You know where I'll be.

01:07:40.513 --> 01:07:43.209
I don't trust anyone else.

01:07:43.283 --> 01:07:45.183
It has to be you.

01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:48.152
The mail, Clay.

01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:50.451
She still had her mail.

01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:52.787
Wait. Jonathan?

01:07:58.898 --> 01:08:01.992
Haven't I see you around?

01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:04.366
Only took me a second to put it together.

01:08:04.437 --> 01:08:06.268
Sometimes you have
to hold the button down

01:08:06.339 --> 01:08:08.807
for a while to get it to work.

01:08:08.875 --> 01:08:11.207
She'd been to that hospital before.

01:08:11.277 --> 01:08:13.802
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:19.011
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

01:08:19.085 --> 01:08:20.211
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:26.015
Why didn't you just say something?

01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:28.685
There was no time.

01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:32.629
You were dying, you needed a heart.

01:08:32.698 --> 01:08:35.133
I had no choice.

01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:41.868
Get a DLP vent ready.

01:08:41.941 --> 01:08:43.203
Doctor, how does he look?

01:08:43.276 --> 01:08:45.743
Terrible.
He's been on bypass too long.

01:08:45.812 --> 01:08:47.040
Let's prep the new organ.

01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:48.636
Still going to attempt transplant?

01:08:48.715 --> 01:08:51.046
Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.

01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:54.546
Give me a knife and a flat vent.

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:58.853
Sorry, Lilith.

01:08:58.925 --> 01:09:01.325
I'm so sorry.

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:07.361
I'm looking for it.

01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:09.229
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:14.399
Beresford transplant...
operating room B.

01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:16.805
Becky, it's me.

01:09:16.876 --> 01:09:18.434
Listen, get her up
and get her dressed now.

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:20.001
I'm coming back.

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:21.979
Becky, just do it, okay?

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.745
My car is downstairs.

01:09:30.223 --> 01:09:32.417
Doctor?

01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:34.288
Larry.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:35.384
You're not going to believe what...

01:09:35.461 --> 01:09:37.087
Over here!

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.734
Stop! Hands up!

01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:45.292
Ah!

01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:52.736
Give me the heart.

01:09:52.812 --> 01:09:55.747
Heartbeat in position.

01:09:55.815 --> 01:09:58.283
Get a 3-0 ready.

01:09:58.351 --> 01:09:59.716
No, no, no. It's too fast.

01:09:59.786 --> 01:10:01.413
- What if...
- I'll do the worrying.

01:10:01.487 --> 01:10:02.545
Here, watch that clamp.

01:10:02.622 --> 01:10:04.055
Pick up stitch.

01:10:05.058 --> 01:10:07.618
Come on, come on.

01:10:07.694 --> 01:10:09.753
Load the Milrinone.

01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:12.161
Just give me time. We need to move.

01:10:19.806 --> 01:10:22.331
Come here.

01:10:22.408 --> 01:10:24.933
- What the fuck is going on?
- Relax.

01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.239
Look, what did I tell you?

01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:27.836
I told you I was going
to look after you, didn't I?

01:10:27.914 --> 01:10:30.610
You trusted me this far,
so just keep quiet.

01:10:30.683 --> 01:10:33.151
I almost forgot.

01:10:33.219 --> 01:10:36.086
I've had this way too long
to leave this behind.

01:10:37.223 --> 01:10:38.520
Three-one.

01:10:38.591 --> 01:10:41.560
Wet his hands.

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.027
John, we're running out of time.

01:10:43.096 --> 01:10:44.961
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:46.157
Scissor.

01:10:46.232 --> 01:10:47.597
Cut.

01:10:49.135 --> 01:10:52.502
Head down, pressure down.

01:10:52.572 --> 01:10:55.268
Cross clamp off.

01:10:58.745 --> 01:11:01.145
- We got rhythm.
- Looks good.

01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:07.783
I can't go with you.

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.122
What?

01:11:12.191 --> 01:11:14.182
They want you.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.821
You're the one who
injected the heart, not me.

01:11:17.897 --> 01:11:19.194
They don't want me.

01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:23.198
Sam.

01:11:23.269 --> 01:11:26.500
I'm sorry.

01:11:26.572 --> 01:11:29.473
I'm just the grieving
widow, remember?

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:34.407
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.107
- Yeah, you did.
- No!

01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:41.384
Going to be kind of hard
to play a grieving widow

01:11:41.454 --> 01:11:43.388
with your fingerprints
all on the syringe.

01:11:43.456 --> 01:11:46.254
Jack.

01:11:46.325 --> 01:11:48.520
Jack, come on.

01:11:48.594 --> 01:11:49.526
Let me in.

01:11:50.663 --> 01:11:52.153
Jack.

01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:54.222
Come on.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.564
Please?

01:11:56.636 --> 01:11:58.831
Goddamn you.
Open the fucking door.

01:11:58.905 --> 01:12:00.736
Open the door now!

01:12:00.807 --> 01:12:02.934
Jack, please!

01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:03.976
Open the fucking door.

01:12:04.043 --> 01:12:05.567
Bye, Sam.

01:12:05.645 --> 01:12:07.408
Jack!

01:12:14.153 --> 01:12:16.383
Closing the chest. Pressure okay?

01:12:16.456 --> 01:12:18.788
No Vicryl.

01:12:18.858 --> 01:12:20.052
Sop it wet.

01:12:20.126 --> 01:12:21.957
Yeah.

01:12:22.028 --> 01:12:23.188
Scissor, please.

01:12:25.164 --> 01:12:26.631
Cut.

01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:34.330
Great job.

01:12:34.407 --> 01:12:35.738
Well, we do what we can.

01:12:35.808 --> 01:12:37.105
Amazing.

01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:41.011
God damn it.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.514
- He's in fib.
- Shit.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:45.642
Get me an amp of eppy now.

01:12:45.718 --> 01:12:46.946
Clay.

01:12:47.019 --> 01:12:48.509
Come on, Clayton.

01:12:48.588 --> 01:12:50.579
I'm trying to be a hero here.
Don't make me look bad.

01:12:52.091 --> 01:12:53.888
I'm going to stay here with you.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.155
There's no one left
for me out there anyway.

01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:57.753
You don't need anyone else.

01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:00.264
You do it yourself, Clay.

01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:02.198
- You're strong.
- I'm not him.

01:13:02.268 --> 01:13:03.496
I tried, Mom.

01:13:03.569 --> 01:13:06.902
Really, I did, but...
I'm just not him.

01:13:06.973 --> 01:13:07.962
He's still in fib.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.803
- Clay.
- Never going to be.

01:13:09.876 --> 01:13:12.242
- Charge the paddles.
- I don't want you to be.

01:13:12.311 --> 01:13:13.972
We're losing him.

01:13:17.049 --> 01:13:18.073
200.

01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:19.209
Clear.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.552
Come on.

01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:24.249
I have to show you something.

01:13:24.323 --> 01:13:25.813
I don't want to see this.

01:13:25.892 --> 01:13:27.450
I'm afraid you have to.

01:13:27.527 --> 01:13:30.462
<i>Remember, Clay?</i>

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:33.363
I am remembering.

01:13:33.432 --> 01:13:35.900
I'm watching the TV.
What do you want from me?

01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:37.492
No, you're not. Look.

01:13:39.906 --> 01:13:41.396
You're listening.

01:13:41.474 --> 01:13:42.941
...are we going to talk about this, Lilith?

01:13:43.009 --> 01:13:44.340
How many fucking times?

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:46.275
I don't want to remember anymore.

01:13:46.345 --> 01:13:48.176
- Jesus, don't you ever shut up?
- You never did.

01:13:48.247 --> 01:13:49.544
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

01:13:49.615 --> 01:13:50.843
This is bullshit.

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:54.216
This is just
my imagination, that's all.

01:13:54.287 --> 01:13:55.777
Just watch.

01:13:56.856 --> 01:13:57.788
Come on, Clayton. Come on.

01:13:57.857 --> 01:14:00.087
- No change.
- Give me 300.

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:02.992
Start mixing amio.

01:14:03.062 --> 01:14:05.053
- Clayton, come on.
- Charge.

01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:06.155
Clear.

01:14:09.135 --> 01:14:10.102
Daddy?

01:14:12.872 --> 01:14:15.363
Hey! Hey! Stop talking.

01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:20.107
Dad.

01:14:20.179 --> 01:14:23.148
All right, I heard you the first time!

01:14:23.216 --> 01:14:25.878
Come on, Clayton. It's Christmas.

01:14:25.952 --> 01:14:27.681
Put it on.

01:14:27.753 --> 01:14:29.015
Ah!

01:14:29.088 --> 01:14:31.818
- Daddy, please!
- Fucking bitch. Jesus!

01:14:31.891 --> 01:14:33.518
Don't you two ever shut up?

01:14:33.593 --> 01:14:35.288
This is what you want, Lilith, isn't it?

01:14:35.361 --> 01:14:36.623
Huh? How's this look?

01:14:36.696 --> 01:14:37.685
This make you happy?

01:14:37.763 --> 01:14:38.821
Daddy, please!

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:39.830
All right. That's it!

01:14:39.899 --> 01:14:41.264
Please leave him alone.

01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:43.325
Couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you, Clay?

01:14:43.402 --> 01:14:44.562
- Clayton.
- Come here.

01:14:44.637 --> 01:14:46.662
- Please.
- Come here!

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:47.865
- Clayton!
- Come here!

01:14:59.819 --> 01:15:01.753
I said leave him alone.

01:15:35.354 --> 01:15:36.787
- Still in fib.
- Give me 360.

01:15:36.856 --> 01:15:39.450
- We lost him.
- No. Again.

01:15:39.525 --> 01:15:41.618
- 360.
- Clear.

01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:51.669
You didn't want to remember, Clay.

01:15:53.839 --> 01:15:55.966
I let you forget
because I thought the truth

01:15:56.042 --> 01:16:00.411
would be too hard to live with.

01:16:00.479 --> 01:16:03.380
I thought I was protecting you.

01:16:03.449 --> 01:16:07.351
But all I did
was cause you more pain.

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.581
I am so sorry.

01:16:12.024 --> 01:16:16.222
I'm not proud
of what I became, Clay,

01:16:16.295 --> 01:16:19.526
but I am proud
of what you've become.

01:16:19.598 --> 01:16:22.658
You're a hundred times
the man he was.

01:16:25.237 --> 01:16:27.205
You always were.

01:16:38.684 --> 01:16:41.209
It's time for you to live.

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:08.313
Clayton...

01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:09.848
Stop.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:12.508
We got him.

01:17:15.988 --> 01:17:18.183
Welcome back, Clayton.

01:17:19.759 --> 01:17:21.727
Welcome back.

01:17:28.934 --> 01:17:32.631
<i>At 6:32 this morning,</i>

01:17:32.705 --> 01:17:37.165
<i>on Thursday, the first of November,</i>

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:42.044
<i>Clayton Beresford, Jr.,
died on my operating table.</i>

01:17:45.551 --> 01:17:50.818
<i>Two and a half hours later,
his life was saved.</i>

01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:57.929
<i>There are no excuses for what we did.</i>

01:17:57.997 --> 01:18:00.761
<i>There's no defense,</i>

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:02.801
<i>no one to blame but us.</i>

01:18:05.037 --> 01:18:08.234
<i>We got what we deserved.</i>

01:18:08.307 --> 01:18:11.572
<i>Clay would have his revenge,</i>

01:18:11.644 --> 01:18:14.613
<i>and justice would finally be served.</i>

01:18:16.282 --> 01:18:19.479
<i>For despite all the secrets,</i>

01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:23.579
<i>despite all the lies and a...
a terrible loss,</i>

01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:29.084
<i>only thing really matters now.</i>

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:36.866
<i>He... is... awake.</i>

01:21:15.995 --> 01:21:20.989
<i># You rely on someone else #</i>

01:21:26.705 --> 01:21:32.337

01:21:37.316 --> 01:21:42.583
