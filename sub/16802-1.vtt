00:00.237 --> 00:01.807
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.939 --> 00:03.865
I don't think I can do this.

00:04.050 --> 00:06.398
What ever this is.

00:06.502 --> 00:10.138
I can't go backwards, Peter,
I have to go forward.

00:10.172 --> 00:11.939
I don't think we should
get back together.

00:11.974 --> 00:13.641
Adam you gotta see this.

00:16.912 --> 00:18.846
Amy: I have a gift for you too.

00:18.881 --> 00:20.948
You're gonna be a father.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.852
- What? (Happy exhale)
- Amy are...?

00:24.887 --> 00:27.221
Yeah. (Kiss)

00:27.256 --> 00:29.390
(Happy laughter)

00:33.162 --> 00:34.862
(Hooves thumping)

00:37.266 --> 00:38.633
(Hooves galloping)

00:44.273 --> 00:45.973
Whoa. (Spartan snorts)

01:06.995 --> 01:09.464
(Spartan snorts ominously)

01:13.001 --> 01:15.036
(Spartan rumbles angrily)

01:16.438 --> 01:18.606
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

01:18.640 --> 01:20.108
(Echoing) Spartan!

01:20.142 --> 01:22.076
(Whimpering) Spartan.

01:24.046 --> 01:27.482
(Gasps) Ty: Hey, Amy, time to wake up.

01:27.516 --> 01:28.983
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:29.017 --> 01:30.001
(Phone beeps)

01:30.094 --> 01:31.070
We gotta get going.

01:31.136 --> 01:33.187
Okay. (Exhales)

01:34.623 --> 01:36.257
(Sighs)

01:36.291 --> 01:38.426
You okay?

01:38.460 --> 01:40.495
Mmm-hmm.

01:40.529 --> 01:42.029
How's the little nugget doin'?

01:42.064 --> 01:43.569
(Chuckles)

01:43.666 --> 01:45.033
Really good.

01:45.067 --> 01:46.434
Good.

01:46.469 --> 01:47.836
(Kiss)

01:51.674 --> 01:53.308
Tim:
You still rummagin' around in there?

01:53.342 --> 01:55.076
I'm telling you, if that thing's gone

01:55.111 --> 01:56.644
I will never forgive you.

01:56.679 --> 01:58.046
Well, maybe if you let me in

01:58.080 --> 02:00.148
on what you're actually looking for,
I could help you.

02:00.182 --> 02:01.649
Mitch: Hey, Jack!

02:02.975 --> 02:03.925
Come here!

02:04.031 --> 02:05.244
Yeah.

02:08.023 --> 02:09.457
Great.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.327
(Horse snorts) Isn't she awesome?

02:12.361 --> 02:13.728
Jack: Well,
I'da come along with you guys

02:13.762 --> 02:15.130
if only you'd asked.

02:15.164 --> 02:16.564
Well, we looked around for you, Jack,

02:16.599 --> 02:18.233
but you were nowhere to be found.

02:18.267 --> 02:20.735
It's all right though.
This girl she really knows her horses.

02:20.769 --> 02:23.671
It was so weird, Jack.
She just sort of... chose me.

02:23.706 --> 02:25.073
Oh she did, did she?

02:25.107 --> 02:26.908
It's true.
The horse just locked onto her.

02:26.942 --> 02:28.743
Tim: Of all the horses
that you coulda bought,

02:28.777 --> 02:30.311
this is the one you chose?

02:30.346 --> 02:31.713
She's kinda heavy.

02:31.747 --> 02:33.114
It's just a hay belly.

02:33.149 --> 02:34.916
We can slim her down, no problem.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.685
She's got a great personality,
really friendly.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.087
I'm in love with her.

02:39.121 --> 02:40.755
Oh, well, you love her?

02:40.789 --> 02:42.757
That's all the criteria
you need to buy a horse.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.726
Right, Mitch?

02:44.760 --> 02:47.262
Not your forte.
I think I'll buy the horses from now on

02:47.296 --> 02:49.063
for the dude ranch.

02:51.834 --> 02:54.736
- Did I say something?
- Oh, he's in a mood.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.271
Georgie: He's always in a mood lately.

02:56.305 --> 02:57.972
(Truck rumbles up)

03:01.310 --> 03:02.877
(Quiet chuckle)

03:02.912 --> 03:04.512
(Truck rumbles)

03:07.183 --> 03:09.050
Okay, let's, uh, let's continue with

03:09.084 --> 03:11.186
Minnie's apparently
much needed exercise.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.921
Georgie: Right. (Clicks teeth)

03:31.307 --> 03:34.829
Amy: So this ultrasound,
do you think we should be concerned?

03:36.011 --> 03:41.017
No, we just need to take a closer look.
Check it out.

03:41.217 --> 03:42.784
Mmm hmm.

03:42.818 --> 03:44.152
(Exhales)

03:45.057 --> 03:46.988
Feeling okay?

03:47.022 --> 03:52.049
Yeah, just a bit nauseous.
I don't get it.

03:52.528 --> 03:54.162
I never get car sick.

03:56.232 --> 03:59.834
Amy, you're not car sick.
You're pregnant.

03:59.868 --> 04:01.169
(Laughing)

04:01.785 --> 04:03.972
Right, of course.

04:05.407 --> 04:07.008
(Exhales)

04:09.945 --> 04:11.946
You know, if you need any help
with the dude ranch horses

04:11.981 --> 04:14.549
I can groom them, exercise them.

04:16.017 --> 04:18.052
Really? That'd be great.
I just, I thought you said

04:18.087 --> 04:19.454
you had a crazy schedule.

04:19.488 --> 04:21.827
Yeah, that might change.

04:22.524 --> 04:24.993
(Sighs) Something really awful
happened with extreme team.

04:25.027 --> 04:27.795
- Oh wow.
- Yeah, don't ask.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.998
Oh, I, I wasn't going to.

04:30.032 --> 04:33.301
Oh, thanks. I wish everyone
in my family was like you.

04:33.335 --> 04:34.802
(Chuckles)

04:34.837 --> 04:36.904
So you're serious about
me putting you to work?

04:36.939 --> 04:38.840
I mean, I'd welcome the help any time.

04:38.874 --> 04:41.242
- Yeah, I'm there.
- All right.

04:42.678 --> 04:44.045
(Phone beeps)

04:45.914 --> 04:48.082
Oh what's that,
another text from you know who?

04:48.117 --> 04:50.018
How many has that been
in the last half hour?

04:50.052 --> 04:52.353
It's called communication.

04:52.388 --> 04:54.822
It's what makes a relationship work.

04:54.857 --> 04:56.858
- You don't say.
- Hey!

04:58.460 --> 04:59.827
Hey.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.962
You know, why don't I, uh,
take care of Minnie? You...

05:08.489 --> 05:10.438
You do what you have to do to
make your relationship work.

05:10.472 --> 05:12.173
Thanks.

05:12.207 --> 05:13.941
- Hi.
- Hey. (Kiss)

05:16.111 --> 05:18.346
So I realized we have an
anniversary coming up.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.015
- We do?
- Yeah, so we're gonna figure out

05:21.050 --> 05:23.084
what we want to do to celebrate it.

05:23.118 --> 05:24.919
- Okay.
- Is the computer in the office?

05:24.953 --> 05:26.774
Yeah, yeah.

05:27.589 --> 05:30.858
So what exactly is it
that we're celebrating?

05:30.893 --> 05:32.260
It's the third month
anniversary of the day

05:32.294 --> 05:33.895
we decided to be more than friends.

05:33.929 --> 05:38.866
Oh. I like to think of it as
the anniversary of the day

05:38.901 --> 05:41.936
you dumped Olivia for me. (Chuckles)

05:43.339 --> 05:44.939
- All right.
- Okay uh...

05:46.408 --> 05:47.775
What about Maggie's for dinner?

05:47.810 --> 05:49.177
No. We always go to Maggie's.

05:49.211 --> 05:52.146
We should go somewhere different,
somewhere special.

05:52.181 --> 05:54.120
Okay. (Keyboard keys click)

05:55.651 --> 05:57.585
No sushi!

05:57.619 --> 05:58.986
What? Why no sushi?

05:59.021 --> 06:01.207
I don't like seafood. (Door opens)

06:01.924 --> 06:03.331
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:03.410 --> 06:04.716
Hey guys.

06:04.901 --> 06:07.295
Hey, Adam, uh can you do
this on Georgie's computer?

06:07.329 --> 06:09.230
Amy and I need to look at something.

06:09.264 --> 06:10.631
No problem. We're out of here.

06:10.666 --> 06:11.999
Okay, thanks.

06:13.469 --> 06:15.136
Why don't you like sushi again?

06:15.170 --> 06:19.307
Come on, I hate sushi.
You know I hate sushi.

06:21.510 --> 06:23.511
(Keyboard keys click)

06:28.050 --> 06:30.551
Is that what I think it is?

06:30.586 --> 06:33.621
Is there two of them?

Georgie: So, yeah,
we've been on a break for a while.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.207
Trudie, our trainer's, been off judging,

07:26.241 --> 07:29.210
but extreme team practice
starts up again tomorrow.

07:29.244 --> 07:30.645
I can't wait to get back!

- Yeah, it is.

07:34.416 --> 07:36.984
I'm gonna beat Olivia in
the spring competitions.

07:37.019 --> 07:39.487
Well, if Olivia's anything
like what you told me,

07:39.521 --> 07:41.422
she deserves it.

07:41.457 --> 07:44.091
Hey, what do think about this guy?

07:44.126 --> 07:47.919
No. His back's too bowed.
He doesn't look strong enough.

07:49.565 --> 07:51.666
Well, you're the boss.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.335

08:18.093 --> 08:20.686
Hey, Georgie, here's a nice one.

08:27.736 --> 08:29.604
(Horse snorts)

08:31.373 --> 08:33.307
Hi. (Laughs)

08:35.110 --> 08:38.044
You want to come home with us, don't ya?

08:38.080 --> 08:40.280
Actually, I,
I think I found one over here.

08:40.315 --> 08:42.416
(Horse snuffles)

08:45.940 --> 08:48.222
Yeah? (Reading) Minnie.

08:48.257 --> 08:50.091
(Horse snuffles)

08:50.125 --> 08:52.760
- (Laughs)
- Huh.

08:52.794 --> 08:55.496
I mean, come on, it's weird.
Amy still hasn't told anyone

08:55.531 --> 08:57.098
and she could now.

08:57.132 --> 09:00.501
It's true. Jack is chomping
at the bit to tell everyone.

09:00.536 --> 09:03.070
No I am not.

09:03.105 --> 09:06.107
Lisa: You would tell a stranger
on the street if you could.

09:06.141 --> 09:07.508
But to be fair it is early.

09:07.543 --> 09:10.144
And I totally get that,
but you know what?

09:10.178 --> 09:12.313
I'm not sure that Amy is facing the fact

09:12.347 --> 09:15.116
that she's having a baby.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.251
Well, she's having her 12
week ultrasound very shortly

09:17.286 --> 09:19.287
so she's not ignoring
the situation entirely.

09:19.321 --> 09:22.123
But do you see any pregnancy
books lying around? No.

09:22.157 --> 09:23.524
She's not doing any reading.

09:23.559 --> 09:25.993
That's the first thing I did. But the...

09:26.028 --> 09:27.795
She hasn't even asked me any questions!
It's like...

09:27.829 --> 09:30.097
it's like she thinks
everything is the same,

09:30.132 --> 09:32.733
that everything will just stay the same.

09:32.768 --> 09:35.169
Jack: Amy is just fine.

09:35.203 --> 09:38.105
She isn't like you
when you were pregnant.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.508
Uh, excuse me?

09:40.542 --> 09:42.810
And how was I when I was pregnant?

09:42.844 --> 09:44.645
Well, you were...

09:48.183 --> 09:52.459
You were you and Amy is Amy.

09:52.788 --> 09:55.189
Lou: Okay, well... I'm not exactly sure

09:55.223 --> 09:57.124
what that's supposed to mean,
but a question...

09:57.159 --> 09:58.726
how are they supposed to start a family

09:58.760 --> 10:01.128
in a room above a barn?

10:01.163 --> 10:03.664
Amy should be planning now.
She should be getting prepared.

10:03.699 --> 10:05.433
Lisa: It's a beautiful room.
They just renovated.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.335
You're not gonna get 'em out of there,
that's for sure.

10:07.369 --> 10:08.603
(Cell phone chimes) No nursery.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.172
Well, people sleep with their
children-where are you off to?

10:11.206 --> 10:13.541
- Uh... (mumbles)
- Nicole, hi!

10:13.575 --> 10:15.209
How's it going? What a surprise.

10:15.243 --> 10:17.046
How's New York?

10:17.746 --> 10:19.747
What? Say that again.

10:21.883 --> 10:25.186
But that's huge! I... N-n-no, okay.

10:25.220 --> 10:27.588
N-no I'm listening.
I need, I need details.

10:28.727 --> 10:31.258
Is Auntie Amy having a baby?

10:34.196 --> 10:35.563
(Motorcycle rumbles)

10:35.597 --> 10:37.164
(Hooves clop)

10:38.867 --> 10:40.267
Ty: Who's this?

10:40.302 --> 10:42.403
The new dude ranch horse?

10:42.437 --> 10:45.473
Georgie: Yeah, this is Minnie.
She's perfect.

10:45.507 --> 10:48.509
Even tempered, easy to ride,
a great trail horse.

10:48.543 --> 10:51.646
All right. Has she been vetted?

10:51.680 --> 10:55.383
Well, she didn't come with papers,
but how could I say no?

10:55.417 --> 10:56.751
I had my marching orders.

10:56.785 --> 10:58.252
It was this horse or the highway.

10:58.286 --> 11:00.588
(Chuckles) (Phone beeps)

11:00.622 --> 11:02.289
Well,
why don't I take a look at her then.

11:02.324 --> 11:05.726
- Oh yeah, great idea.
- Okay. Hey Minnie, let's go.

11:05.761 --> 11:08.229
(Hooves clop) (Phone beeps)

11:09.631 --> 11:11.465
Oh great, Olivia.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.301
No, Nicole, this is so great.

11:14.336 --> 11:15.903
Of course.

11:15.937 --> 11:17.905
Okay. I'm gonna get back to you soon.

11:17.939 --> 11:19.640
Okay, bye.

11:19.675 --> 11:21.242
(Phone beeps off) Hey.

11:21.276 --> 11:22.610
Guess what? I just heard from Olivia

11:22.644 --> 11:24.011
and Trudie broke her collarbone.

11:24.046 --> 11:25.913
She can't coach extreme team,
not for months!

11:25.947 --> 11:27.715
Oh no! Poor Trudie.

11:27.749 --> 11:30.584
(Sighs) There's hiring a new coach.
This is awful!

11:30.619 --> 11:32.520
Trudie was awesome!
How could they replace her?!

11:32.554 --> 11:34.622
The new coach is gonna be great, okay?

11:34.656 --> 11:37.425
Trudie wouldn't pick a bad replacement.

11:37.459 --> 11:40.227
- I've got to tell Adam!
- Okay, hold on.

11:40.262 --> 11:43.230
You have been attached at the
hip with this phone lately.

11:43.265 --> 11:44.632
Don't you think you and
Adam should give each other

11:44.666 --> 11:46.434
just a little bit of space?

11:46.468 --> 11:48.669
Besides, I want to talk to you.

11:48.704 --> 11:50.771
Something's come up and
it's pretty exciting.

11:50.806 --> 11:52.707
(Phone rings)

11:52.741 --> 11:54.075
(Sighs)

11:59.481 --> 12:00.981
(Phone beeps on)

12:01.016 --> 12:02.483
Hi, Olivia.

12:02.517 --> 12:04.318
Yeah, so how bad is this new coach?

12:04.352 --> 12:06.237
No, Georgie, I need to talk to you!

12:06.290 --> 12:07.451
Georgie: That bad?

12:07.543 --> 12:09.179
What kind of mess is this?

12:10.959 --> 12:12.727
(Small laugh)

12:18.800 --> 12:20.968
(Approaching footsteps)

12:24.439 --> 12:26.373
Hey. Hon, did you buy more clementines?

12:26.408 --> 12:28.075
I can't seem to find them.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.610
That's because you ate them all.

12:29.644 --> 12:31.979
- No I didn't.
- Yes you did.

12:32.013 --> 12:33.781
Two dozen in two days.

12:33.815 --> 12:35.909
Well, I like clementines.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.985
(Laughing) Clearly.

12:38.019 --> 12:39.386
Who's this?

12:39.421 --> 12:40.988
This is a new trail horse. Minnie.

12:41.022 --> 12:44.325
Minnie, huh?
Not really what I would have named her.

12:44.359 --> 12:46.327
I think we're gonna have to
change your diet there, girl.

12:46.361 --> 12:47.695
She's a little on the heavy side.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.530
Well, there's a reason for that.

12:49.564 --> 12:51.332
She's pregnant.

12:51.366 --> 12:53.868
- She's pregnant?
- Yeah.

12:53.902 --> 12:56.537
- Why would Mitch...
- Buy her?

12:56.571 --> 12:58.339
Well, he probably didn't know.

12:58.373 --> 13:00.374
It was love at first site with Georgie

13:00.408 --> 13:03.544
and she's got Mitch wrapped
around her little finger.

13:03.578 --> 13:04.979
I'm actually a little
concerned about Minnie though,

13:05.013 --> 13:07.650
so I'm gonna give Scott a call,
get a second opinion.

13:08.650 --> 13:11.018
(Truck rumbles, shuts off)

13:13.989 --> 13:15.356
(Grunts with effort)

13:15.390 --> 13:17.424
Just the guy I'm lookin' to talk to.

13:17.459 --> 13:18.859
(Door shuts)

13:18.894 --> 13:21.328
Yeah, I want to talk to you too.

13:21.363 --> 13:22.830
It's just about time
to take the cattle up

13:22.864 --> 13:24.231
to the summer pastures.

13:24.266 --> 13:26.667
So I think it'd be great if
you could give me a heads up

13:26.701 --> 13:28.669
let me know when you want to go
up there and check things out,

13:28.703 --> 13:30.871
because I got a busy schedule
and I want to plan ahead.

13:30.906 --> 13:32.373
Well, you don't have to plan.

13:32.407 --> 13:33.774
You don't even have to worry about it.

13:33.809 --> 13:36.377
Mitch and I are gonna take care of it.

13:36.411 --> 13:38.546
Mitch? You and Mitch?

13:38.580 --> 13:41.549
Well, you're the guy crying
about how busy you are.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.983
Mitch can handle it.

13:43.018 --> 13:47.354
Now, you were the guy that
cleared out that barn loft

13:47.389 --> 13:49.723
before the renovations got started.

13:49.758 --> 13:51.725
What did you do with all
the stuff that was up there?

13:51.760 --> 13:53.394
- I put it in there.
- No, you didn't,

13:53.428 --> 13:55.563
'cause I just came from there.
I scoured through everything,

13:55.597 --> 13:57.431
I didn't find what I'm lookin' for.

13:57.465 --> 13:58.833
Well, if I didn't put in there

13:58.867 --> 14:00.901
then I threw it out 'cause it was junk.

14:00.936 --> 14:03.470
You just threw stuff out
without asking me first?!

14:03.505 --> 14:04.905
There's not enough room
in the entire world

14:04.940 --> 14:07.041
for all the crap you wanna keep!

14:07.075 --> 14:09.877
Someone had to make a decision.

14:09.911 --> 14:12.913
That someone was me. What's so important

14:12.948 --> 14:14.782
that you're out there looking
for it a year and a half

14:14.816 --> 14:17.418
after I threw it out?

14:17.452 --> 14:21.422
Never mind. I'll look again.

14:22.691 --> 14:25.860
Well, I managed to get her an
appointment at the vet med centre.

14:25.894 --> 14:28.896
Yeah, they're gonna run
some tests on her, so...

14:28.930 --> 14:31.031
Okay, thanks, Scott. (Keys jingle)

14:31.066 --> 14:32.833
I'll have the results sent to you.
It's...

14:32.868 --> 14:35.536
It's just a hunch,
but I wanna confirm it.

14:37.230 --> 14:40.040
Okay. Thanks, Scott. (Phone beeps off)

14:40.075 --> 14:42.576
You're worried about her, aren't you?

14:42.611 --> 14:44.645
I just want to be sure, that's all.

14:44.679 --> 14:46.622
(Sighs worriedly) Okay.

14:48.516 --> 14:50.651
Come on. (Hooves clop)

14:50.685 --> 14:53.520
Hey, Dad,
I just got this craziest phone call.

14:53.555 --> 14:56.423
It's actually pretty awesome.
Wait till you hear about it.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.092
Hey, Ty,
you know that truck of yours is no good

14:58.126 --> 15:00.127
for any kind of real work, huh?

15:00.161 --> 15:01.795
It's too light to pull a trailer,

15:01.830 --> 15:03.230
terrible in the winter.

15:03.265 --> 15:04.665
They're not hanging onto
it for long anyway, right?

15:04.699 --> 15:06.066
What?

15:06.101 --> 15:08.435
Baby seat. There's nowhere to put it.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.471
You can't even get home from
the hospital in that thing.

15:10.505 --> 15:12.139
That's not for months, Lou.

15:12.173 --> 15:14.675
Yeah, we still have time
to figure all that out.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.011
They're not gettin' this.
You guys are not getting this.

15:17.045 --> 15:19.446
You know,
things are gonna change with this baby.

15:19.481 --> 15:22.082
You know that. Yeah, we know that.

15:22.117 --> 15:24.618
Thank you, dad, you know,
someone had to say it.

15:24.653 --> 15:27.521
Completely change.
(Laughs) Completely change.

15:27.555 --> 15:29.490
(Door shuts, truck starts) You better...

15:29.524 --> 15:32.493
you better get ready.

15:32.527 --> 15:34.928
Dad? Dad?

15:37.999 --> 15:39.500
Ay, sorry we're late.

15:39.534 --> 15:42.469
No, no, it's good you guys are here.
There's plenty left.

15:42.504 --> 15:44.872
Ah, thanks for this, Lou.

15:46.308 --> 15:47.641
Tim: Make sure to get enough, Amy.

15:47.676 --> 15:49.510
I'm hungry, okay?

15:49.544 --> 15:50.911
Is Minnie back?

15:50.946 --> 15:52.335
Ah yeah. She's in her stall.

15:52.414 --> 15:54.148
Okay, dad, I meant to talk
to you about this earlier...

15:54.182 --> 15:55.549
Who's Minnie?

15:55.583 --> 15:58.052
Uh,
she's the new dude ranch trail horse.

15:58.086 --> 15:59.520
Tim: The one I saw you trailering?

15:59.554 --> 16:01.822
We own that horse? That's ours?

16:01.856 --> 16:05.192
I thought that was one of
Amy's lost cause client horses.

16:05.226 --> 16:07.561
She's not a lost cause.

16:07.595 --> 16:09.163
Mitch and I bought her at
the auction this morning.

16:09.197 --> 16:10.998
Okay, now that that's settled,
I just want to...

16:11.032 --> 16:13.567
Tim: Mitch. Since when did
Mitch start buyin' horses?

16:13.601 --> 16:16.136
Since he started workin' for me.

16:16.171 --> 16:17.555
Okay, good to know.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.641
Okay, can I say something?
Is that possible? Thank you.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.610
I have some news.
I talked to Nicole today.

16:23.645 --> 16:25.286
She called from New York.

16:25.378 --> 16:27.848
When I was there a few months ago
we had talked about this idea.

16:27.882 --> 16:29.516
I never thought she would
follow through on it,

16:29.551 --> 16:30.951
but she did,

16:30.986 --> 16:32.720
And now she has investors interested.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.855
Ooh, investors interested in what?

16:34.889 --> 16:36.724
Lou:
You guys are never gonna believe this.

16:36.758 --> 16:41.528
These investors want to open
up a Maggie's in Brooklyn.

16:41.563 --> 16:43.964
Isn't that crazy?
They want to replicate it...

16:43.999 --> 16:46.867
same look, same menu, but in New York.

16:46.901 --> 16:48.268
Lou, that's amazing!

16:48.303 --> 16:50.871
- Like a franchise?
- No, no, no, just a one off.

16:50.905 --> 16:52.906
No, no, it shouldn't be a one off, no.

16:52.941 --> 16:54.641
My experience with franchises,
I'll tell you...

16:54.676 --> 16:56.176
Oh, here we go.

16:56.211 --> 16:58.545
Lou: No, no, I know, Dad,
but that's not what this is.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.881
So the bottom line is Nicole
wants me to go to New York

17:00.915 --> 17:02.750
to get the deal rolling.

17:02.784 --> 17:04.151
What do you think?

17:04.185 --> 17:05.586
You should do it.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.554
It all sounds like kind of crazy.

17:07.589 --> 17:09.083
Maggie's in New York, I don't...

17:09.162 --> 17:13.463
Well, the investors see a trend for
country and western style brands.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.596
How long would you be gone?

17:15.630 --> 17:17.897
Not long. Just maybe a few days.

17:17.932 --> 17:19.333
A week, a month, a year,

17:19.367 --> 17:20.867
it doesn't matter how long it takes.
Just go.

17:20.902 --> 17:22.869
It's not gonna be a year, dad.

17:22.904 --> 17:26.856
Jack:
So Maggie's diner in New York City.

17:27.474 --> 17:30.778
How about that?
Well, if this is a real thing, Lou,

17:30.812 --> 17:34.281
I guess we'll do whatever
it takes to make it work.

17:34.315 --> 17:35.682
Right girls?

17:35.717 --> 17:38.152
- Sure.
- Hey, put your phone down.

17:38.186 --> 17:41.088
No texting at the table. (Text sends)

17:41.122 --> 17:44.024
- Can I go play, Mommy?
- Sure, sweetie.

17:54.002 --> 17:57.638
Oh damn. Scott had to leave town

17:57.672 --> 17:59.706
before Minnie's results arrived.

17:59.741 --> 18:01.208
He's gonna leave
'em with Cass so we can pick 'em up

18:01.242 --> 18:04.645
- in the morning.
- Okay, sounds good.

18:04.679 --> 18:06.680
(Sighs tiredly)

18:06.714 --> 18:09.950
I cannot believe that Lou
wants us to get a new truck.

18:09.984 --> 18:11.685
I love your truck.

18:12.804 --> 18:16.623
I know you do, Amy, but she's right.

18:16.658 --> 18:18.659
There's no place for a baby seat.

18:18.693 --> 18:21.577
Yeah,
but we have months to think about that.

18:24.365 --> 18:26.333
Your dad's right, Amy.
I hate to admit it,

18:26.367 --> 18:28.635
but our life is really gonna change.

18:30.105 --> 18:33.507
Ty, no it won't.

18:34.976 --> 18:36.643
Whoa

18:37.125 --> 18:38.846
What?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.081
I think I just felt something.

18:41.116 --> 18:43.317
Like a... like just a little
butterfly or something.

18:43.351 --> 18:44.852
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:47.657 --> 18:49.022
(Laughs) Wow.

18:50.492 --> 18:51.859
(Engine rumbles)

18:53.394 --> 18:54.761
Amy: So this ultrasound,

18:54.796 --> 18:57.122
do you think we should be concerned?

18:58.133 --> 19:01.792
No, we just need to take a closer look.

19:02.403 --> 19:03.804
Check it out.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.706
Mmm hmm. (Door opens)

19:05.740 --> 19:06.911
Hi.

19:07.082 --> 19:08.679
- Hey.
- Hey guys.

19:08.776 --> 19:11.278
Hey, Adam, uh,
can you do this on Georgie's computer?

19:11.312 --> 19:13.113
Amy and I need to look at something.

19:13.148 --> 19:14.748
No problem. We're out of here.

19:14.782 --> 19:16.700
Okay, thanks.

19:17.544 --> 19:19.119
Why don't you like sushi again?

19:19.154 --> 19:22.489
Ah, come on, I hate sushi.
You know I hate sushi.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.727
(Keyboard keys click)

19:30.932 --> 19:33.734
Is that what I think it is?

19:33.768 --> 19:35.936
Is there two of them?

19:37.839 --> 19:39.940
Minnie's having twins.

19:47.065 --> 19:50.034
Mitch, heard the good news.
You were right.

19:50.068 --> 19:52.970
That horse is not overweight.

19:53.004 --> 19:54.972
That horse is pregnant with twins.

19:55.006 --> 19:57.074
- She's pregnant?
- Don't even, you know, you...

19:57.109 --> 20:01.045
You don't have a clue. At this late date

20:01.079 --> 20:03.214
she'll probably lose one
or both of those foals.

20:03.248 --> 20:05.549
- Dad hey.
- Honey, it's true.

20:05.584 --> 20:08.018
Ty: Okay look, Tim,
whoever brought that horse to auction

20:08.053 --> 20:10.221
probably had no idea
the animal was pregnant.

20:10.255 --> 20:13.991
So now we have to do the best
we can with this bad situation.

20:14.025 --> 20:16.026
Situation that you started.

20:16.061 --> 20:17.968
Georgie: What situation?

20:21.032 --> 20:22.399
Minnie's pregnant.

20:22.434 --> 20:24.001
Oh, wow, that's amazing!

20:24.035 --> 20:25.703
I've never seen a horse foal before.

20:25.737 --> 20:27.271
This is gonna be awesome!

20:27.305 --> 20:29.006
(Truck horn honks)

20:29.040 --> 20:30.674
Hey, Georgie, we gotta get going.

20:30.709 --> 20:33.077
You're gonna be late for practice.

20:33.111 --> 20:34.712
Well, Adam and I were gonna go hang out.
Do I have to go?

20:34.746 --> 20:37.014
Yeah, you do, Georgie.

20:37.048 --> 20:38.449
I need to leave anyway.

20:38.483 --> 20:40.017
Okay, bye.

20:40.051 --> 20:42.119
- Lou: Georgie, come on.
- Okay.

20:42.154 --> 20:44.655
Hey knock 'em dead, kid.

20:46.324 --> 20:48.058
(Doors shut)

20:48.093 --> 20:49.727
It's gonna cost more losing two foals

20:49.761 --> 20:51.529
than birthing one healthy one.

20:51.563 --> 20:55.032
This never woulda happened if
you hadn't put Mitch in charge.

20:55.066 --> 21:00.724
Jack: Why do you have such a
weed up your butt about Mitch?

21:01.807 --> 21:03.284
What is that all about?

21:03.350 --> 21:05.671
What's it all about?
I'll tell you what it's all about.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.212
You gonna hire somebody he
should at least have better

21:08.246 --> 21:11.081
than working knowledge of horses.

21:11.116 --> 21:12.483
Or cows for that matter!

21:12.517 --> 21:15.419
Oh cows. Now Mitch doesn't know
anything about cows either.

21:15.453 --> 21:18.756
Isn't that somethin'.
This wouldn't happen to have

21:18.790 --> 21:21.358
anything to do with the
fact that I asked him

21:21.393 --> 21:23.594
to come with me to check
out the summer pasture

21:23.628 --> 21:25.596
instead of you, would it?

21:28.700 --> 21:30.201
(Hooves clopping)

21:31.603 --> 21:34.104
Natalie: Ladies, I'm Natalie Northcote,

21:34.139 --> 21:36.674
and I can't wait to work with you guys.

21:36.708 --> 21:39.443
When Trudie asked me to
take over I hesitated a bit,

21:39.477 --> 21:42.746
because I know what a wonderful
job she's been doing with you all,

21:42.781 --> 21:45.813
but she has put her faith in me

21:46.885 --> 21:49.253
and now it's my turn
to put my faith in you.

21:49.287 --> 21:52.456
I want you to bring your
best attitude to this arena.

21:52.490 --> 21:55.226
I want you to bring your best goals;

21:55.260 --> 21:57.328
I want you to bring your best game;

21:57.362 --> 22:00.097
I want you to bring
the best possible you

22:00.131 --> 22:03.100
you can bring to this team,

22:03.134 --> 22:05.636
and together we will rise to the top.

22:05.670 --> 22:08.439
So, let's, uh,
let's start the class with you.

22:08.473 --> 22:09.807
Olivia, isn't it?

22:09.841 --> 22:11.242
Yeah.

22:11.276 --> 22:13.143
Let's see what you're working on.

22:13.178 --> 22:14.511
(Hooves thunder)

22:17.649 --> 22:19.016
Natalie: Nice!

22:19.050 --> 22:21.118
Very nice extension!

22:24.189 --> 22:26.290
(Clapping) That's it! Way to go, Olivia!

22:31.162 --> 22:32.529
(Loud clatter, keys jangle) Oh! Oh!

22:32.564 --> 22:35.001
- Sorry, I...
- I'm sorry...

22:35.159 --> 22:36.742
Here.

22:37.335 --> 22:38.979
Uh hi.

22:39.097 --> 22:40.535
- Hi.
- How are ya?

22:40.605 --> 22:44.842
- Good. Yeah, I'm good.
- (Nervous exhale)

22:44.876 --> 22:48.345
Pretty exciting, right,
Amy being pregnant?

22:48.380 --> 22:51.148
You know about that. How do you know?

22:51.182 --> 22:53.584
- Jack told me.
- Of course he did.

22:53.618 --> 22:56.654
Uh, I was actually just looking for Amy.

22:56.688 --> 22:58.455
She's upstairs with Ty.

22:58.490 --> 23:01.191
- Okay.
- Hey um...

23:01.226 --> 23:04.260
That's pretty cool about the
whole New York deal thing.

23:04.366 --> 23:05.725
Oh, you know about that too.

23:05.830 --> 23:09.062
Yeah, Georgia told me. Sounds amazing.

23:10.135 --> 23:11.535
It's crazy, right?

23:11.569 --> 23:14.171
I mean, a Maggie's clone in Brooklyn?

23:15.118 --> 23:16.941
It's an incredible opportunity.

23:16.975 --> 23:18.342
My dad thinks so too,

23:18.376 --> 23:20.210
but he probably just has
dollar signs in his eyes.

23:20.245 --> 23:22.479
I mean, he is my partner
in the business after all.

23:22.514 --> 23:25.584
So what's good for Maggie's
is good for him, right?

23:26.495 --> 23:29.420
(Chuckles) Wow, who's...
Who's a bit cynical there?

23:29.454 --> 23:32.189
Now I can see the New York girl in ya.

23:32.223 --> 23:33.891
Hmm.

23:40.532 --> 23:43.200
One in a thousand will survive?

23:43.234 --> 23:46.537
That, that's the odds that
this is gonna go smoothly?

23:46.571 --> 23:47.972
(Knocking) Lou: Hey there!

23:48.006 --> 23:49.340
Everybody decent?

23:49.374 --> 23:53.377
Yes, okay, Amy, read this.
Contrary to what you may think,

23:53.411 --> 23:55.446
and however tired you are
of hearing me say this,

23:55.480 --> 23:59.183
you need to get prepared.
This was my go to.

23:59.217 --> 24:00.584
I'm passing it on to you

24:00.618 --> 24:01.986
complete with my notes in the margin.

24:02.020 --> 24:04.655
Lou, I don't think this
is really the best time.

24:04.689 --> 24:07.825
Why not? When is it ever
a good time for you guys?

24:07.859 --> 24:09.259
Lou.

24:10.762 --> 24:12.596
What's going on?

24:15.467 --> 24:17.101
(Hooves thunder)

24:20.438 --> 24:22.339
(Horse grunts)

24:22.374 --> 24:25.809
Try to float back a bit,
you're too far forward!

24:27.245 --> 24:28.779
That's it! Nice, Olivia.

24:30.248 --> 24:31.582
Nice.

24:32.682 --> 24:34.724
Let's go, Georgie,
we're not here to sit on our butts.

24:34.790 --> 24:37.454
Oh, oh, okay. (Horse snorts)

24:37.489 --> 24:38.922
Whoa.

24:40.358 --> 24:41.725
(Horse snorts)

24:43.194 --> 24:44.528
(Hooves thunder)

24:55.707 --> 24:57.775
(Horse snorts) (Content exhales)

24:57.809 --> 24:59.376
Okay, what was that supposed to be?

24:59.411 --> 25:01.545
You looked like a piece
of overdone spaghetti.

25:01.579 --> 25:03.347
To say it needs work
is an understatement.

25:03.381 --> 25:06.483
You have to put in way more practice,
way more.

25:06.518 --> 25:08.959
Next! Samantha you're up.

25:10.155 --> 25:12.856
Natalie isn't actually so bad, is she?

25:14.426 --> 25:15.793
Natalie is horrible!

25:15.827 --> 25:18.028
She's mean and she says
I need extra practice!

25:18.063 --> 25:19.663
Four nights a week instead of two!

25:19.697 --> 25:22.866
I won't have any time
for anything including...

25:22.901 --> 25:24.701
- Oh my God.
- What?

25:24.736 --> 25:28.672
- Oh my god, this is terrible!
- What now, Georgie?

25:28.706 --> 25:30.774
(Phone beeps) Georgie.

25:32.577 --> 25:35.546
Adam, hi, I am so sorry. I know.

25:35.580 --> 25:38.515
I can't make dinner tomorrow night.
I know this is horrible!

25:38.550 --> 25:40.350
I can't get out of it!

25:40.385 --> 25:42.352
Katie: I don't want to wash my hands!

25:42.387 --> 25:45.322
(Cup clatters)
- Uh... Katie...

25:45.356 --> 25:47.357
is having a bit of a meltdown
and won't wash her hands

25:47.392 --> 25:49.793
unless Mummy comes and does it with her.

25:49.828 --> 25:51.862
(Frustrated grunt)

25:51.896 --> 25:53.630
New York looking pretty
good right about now?

25:53.665 --> 25:56.188
(Groans) Katie: I want my Mommy!

25:58.436 --> 26:01.672
Well, the foals are in a good position.

26:01.706 --> 26:04.875
Now we just need to keep
a close eye on here.

26:04.909 --> 26:09.046
Hey Minnie,
I can't wait to see your baby.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.447
(Door clanks)

26:10.482 --> 26:12.583
Can we keep it? The foal?

26:14.786 --> 26:16.386
Minnie's havin' twins.

26:16.421 --> 26:19.756
Oh, even better! They'll be so cute!

26:21.626 --> 26:23.393
Look Georgie, um...

26:24.718 --> 26:26.697
I'm gonna tell you the truth, okay?

26:26.731 --> 26:28.098
Okay.

26:28.901 --> 26:31.902
Having twins puts a mare in
a very dangerous situation.

26:31.936 --> 26:33.804
Now we're gonna do our best,

26:33.838 --> 26:36.940
but there's a chance the
result could not be good,

26:36.975 --> 26:39.710
in fact, the odds are against us.

26:46.181 --> 26:47.948
<i>(Spartan snorts)</i>

26:49.651 --> 26:51.285
(Wind whistles)

26:55.123 --> 26:57.491
(Wind rustles ominously)
(Spartan snorts)

26:57.525 --> 26:59.293
(Panicked exhale)

27:03.298 --> 27:05.366
(Dramatic music) (Spartan rumbles)

27:05.400 --> 27:07.134
(Echoing) Spartan!

27:10.472 --> 27:12.106
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

27:12.140 --> 27:14.689
(Gasps) Spartan. Spartan!

27:15.143 --> 27:17.311
Amy! Hey.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.746
(Panting)

27:18.780 --> 27:20.481
Hey, it's okay. It was just a dream.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.483
(Panting)

27:22.517 --> 27:25.452
You're all right. You're okay.

27:33.043 --> 27:34.676
Hey, Minnie.

27:36.163 --> 27:37.562
Hey, girl.

27:38.947 --> 27:41.415
Yeah, you're gonna be just fine, okay?

27:41.969 --> 27:43.378
(Minnie snuffles)

27:43.771 --> 27:46.626
So are your babies.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.607
We'll make sure of that.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.163
I promise.

27:58.239 --> 27:59.953
(Horse whinnies in distance)

28:02.625 --> 28:04.670
(Relieved exhale)

28:07.539 --> 28:09.617
(Spartan snorts) Hey.

28:13.133 --> 28:15.968
I haven't lost you, have I?
(Spartan snorts)

28:18.338 --> 28:19.805
Yeah.

28:19.839 --> 28:21.774
(Spartan snorts)

28:21.808 --> 28:24.005
I know.

28:26.546 --> 28:29.381
We're gonna be okay. (Sighs)

28:31.851 --> 28:33.763
(Hooves thunder)

28:36.189 --> 28:37.589
Natalie: Georgie!

28:37.624 --> 28:39.358
Georgie, you're stiff as a board!
Lower your leg!

28:39.392 --> 28:40.826
(Turf clatters)

28:40.860 --> 28:42.861
Lower! Point your toe!

28:45.465 --> 28:46.865
(Hooves thunder)

28:49.469 --> 28:51.303
(Exhales)

28:51.337 --> 28:53.138
Okay, first of all nothing flowed.

28:53.173 --> 28:55.374
That looked painful not amazing.

28:55.408 --> 28:57.543
Maybe you're just not
up for this routine.

28:57.577 --> 28:59.878
No, no, I'm good with it.

28:59.913 --> 29:03.660
Well, I'd start working on something
easier if I were you, Georgie.

29:04.450 --> 29:06.518
Olivia, you're next.

29:08.454 --> 29:11.023
I want you to watch Olivia very closely,
Georgie.

29:11.057 --> 29:13.058
You can learn something.

29:15.028 --> 29:17.863
Yeah, Nicole I know you're
waiting for an answer

29:17.897 --> 29:19.865
and I am trying to make
it work it's just...

29:19.899 --> 29:22.434
It's a very difficult time right now.

29:22.468 --> 29:25.137
Listen, could you just find
out how long these meetings

29:25.171 --> 29:28.983
are gonna take? Okay, thanks.

29:29.242 --> 29:31.877
(Door opens) Uh, can I call you back?

29:31.911 --> 29:33.979
Okay bye. (Door shuts) (Phone beeps off)

29:34.013 --> 29:36.548
I'm quitting extreme team.

29:40.453 --> 29:42.237
Adam, yeah,

29:42.336 --> 29:44.890
do you still have those dinner
reservations for tonight?

29:44.924 --> 29:47.392
I can go now.
I don't have practice anymore.

29:47.427 --> 29:48.894
I quit!

29:48.928 --> 29:51.930
Yeah, I did, really. (Knock on door)

29:51.965 --> 29:53.332
I'll just be a minute.

29:53.366 --> 29:56.235
No. I need you to hang up the phone.

29:56.269 --> 29:58.370
Adam, can I call you right back?

29:58.404 --> 30:00.973
Yeah. Okay, bye. (Phone beeps off)

30:01.007 --> 30:03.275
Look, Georgie,
you can't just quit extreme team,

30:03.309 --> 30:05.444
especially if it's because you
want to spend more time with Adam.

30:05.478 --> 30:07.546
I'm not quitting because of Adam!

30:07.580 --> 30:08.947
It's so unfair of you to say that!

30:08.982 --> 30:11.884
Look I know that he's your boyfriend...

30:11.918 --> 30:13.710
Yeah, he is, and that's important to me.

30:13.792 --> 30:16.922
I know and I get that but I
just heard you on the phone.

30:16.956 --> 30:18.323
You can't just quit the team

30:18.358 --> 30:21.426
because you want to spend
more time with a boy, okay?

30:21.461 --> 30:24.441
- You know that's true.
- No, it's not!

30:25.164 --> 30:26.531
(Sighs)

30:32.005 --> 30:34.940
I bet that you're thinking
this whole New York deal

30:34.974 --> 30:36.909
is looking impossible right about now

30:36.943 --> 30:39.578
with everything's that's
going on around here.

30:39.612 --> 30:41.313
Sit down.

30:41.347 --> 30:42.915
Amy's pregnant;

30:42.949 --> 30:45.951
Georgie has all her "life"
and all that that entails;

30:45.985 --> 30:49.554
but you shouldn't be
thinking about those things.

30:49.589 --> 30:52.157
I thought you were against
this whole Maggie's thing.

30:52.191 --> 30:54.326
Isn't that what you said?
That it's a stupid idea?

30:54.360 --> 30:57.963
No, I didn't say stupid, I,
I said it was just crazy.

30:57.997 --> 30:59.932
- (Exasperated sigh)
- But Maggie's in New York...

30:59.966 --> 31:02.334
It doesn't matter what I think, Lou.

31:02.368 --> 31:04.970
If you think it's gonna work
then you should go for it.

31:05.004 --> 31:06.371
Jack and I will help with the girls.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.041
There's plenty of people
to help Amy and...

31:09.075 --> 31:13.412
I was going to say do what
you think is best for you,

31:13.446 --> 31:15.380
what makes you happy.

31:16.783 --> 31:19.550
I just... I need to clear my head.

31:19.930 --> 31:22.988
I was gonna say that but of course
I know you won't listen to that,

31:23.022 --> 31:25.503
so what I will say is...

31:25.932 --> 31:28.653
it seems like you're looking
to all of us for permission

31:28.736 --> 31:30.996
to start living your own life.

31:32.398 --> 31:34.299
That's all I'm gonna say.

31:42.008 --> 31:44.509
(Hooves clop, wood clatters)

31:44.544 --> 31:47.045
Uh-oh. Mark this wire.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.348
It'll be on the ground
in a month if we don't.

31:49.382 --> 31:51.316
All right. Will do.

31:52.752 --> 31:54.987
Oh wow. I love it up here.

31:55.021 --> 31:57.055
- (Chuckles)
- Look at that view.

31:57.090 --> 32:00.392
Yeah, it ain't ugly, that's for sure.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.563
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Tim...

32:06.065 --> 32:09.067
This post right here's
completely rotted.

32:09.102 --> 32:11.336
You know what happens when
a cow can push a post down

32:11.371 --> 32:12.704
just by just walkin' into it,

32:12.739 --> 32:14.339
it's gone along with
the rest of the herd.

32:14.374 --> 32:16.074
You might want to put a flag that one.

32:16.109 --> 32:18.377
The post isn't that bad.

32:18.411 --> 32:21.446
Hey, you want to take over,
Tim, it's fine by me.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.049
I don't get paid to be up here.

32:24.083 --> 32:26.051
What is your problem?
You're on me all the time.

32:26.085 --> 32:29.121
I don't even work for you.
I'm sick of it, all right?

32:29.155 --> 32:32.591
Why are you trying so hard
to be friends with Georgie?

32:32.625 --> 32:35.773
- She's a good kid.
- Oh yeah, she's a good kid.

32:36.268 --> 32:39.731
I think it's so can
ingratiate yourself to Lou,

32:39.766 --> 32:43.035
which is a cheap way of wormin'
your way into this family.

32:43.069 --> 32:45.270
This is my job, all right, I...

32:45.304 --> 32:48.073
I'm not trying to worm
my way into your family!

32:48.107 --> 32:49.741
Why don't you tell me that
you don't have somethin'

32:49.776 --> 32:52.044
for Lou, huh? Tell me.

32:52.078 --> 32:53.445
All right, knock it off.

32:53.479 --> 32:55.280
Tim, what are you doin' here anyway?

32:55.314 --> 32:58.583
I told you Mitch and I had this covered.

32:58.618 --> 33:01.319
And now you're up here with Jack.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.155
Just startin'
to feel like you own the place?

33:03.189 --> 33:04.723
Mitch: I work here.

33:04.757 --> 33:06.124
You're threatened I'm
gonna take your position

33:06.159 --> 33:08.060
on the ranch? Is that it?

33:08.094 --> 33:09.661
Fine, you know what?

33:09.695 --> 33:12.097
You can handle this by yourself.
I'm outta here.

33:12.131 --> 33:13.498
(Clicks teeth) Come on.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.683
[bell jangles]

33:22.965 --> 33:25.900
<i>What the hell was that? Are you crazy?</i>

33:25.935 --> 33:27.902
No, I'm not.

33:27.937 --> 33:29.537
Mitch has feelings for Lou. I know it.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.939
I've known it since Christmas.

33:30.973 --> 33:32.907
They hardly talk to each other.

33:32.942 --> 33:34.876
Exactly. They don't.

33:34.910 --> 33:38.112
You can cut the tension
between them with a knife.

33:38.147 --> 33:40.582
Jack, I'll tell you what this is about.

33:40.616 --> 33:42.884
I want see Lou go to New York
and I don't want to see her

33:42.918 --> 33:44.886
make the wrong decision as
far as Mitch is concerned,

33:44.920 --> 33:46.888
but you keep opening doors for him.

33:46.922 --> 33:48.556
He's gonna a part of this family.

33:48.591 --> 33:52.239
- Oh, that is stupid!
- You think?

33:52.370 --> 33:57.499
Mitch isn't part of the family...
but you are.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.035
I couldn't get rid of ya if I wanted to.

34:07.505 --> 34:08.444
(Knock at door)

34:08.922 --> 34:11.864
Wow, look at you.

34:13.099 --> 34:14.465
(Phone beeps)

34:15.672 --> 34:17.081
Wait.

34:17.578 --> 34:21.257
Hey... I know I came off a bit harsh.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.389
You need to know I'm not
quitting because of Adam.

34:24.424 --> 34:26.125
I'm quitting because Natalie is rude.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.693
She pits all of us against each other.

34:27.726 --> 34:30.763
I don't need that!
I'm not gonna put up with that.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.699
You're not a quitter, Georgie.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.235
That's not what you do.

34:36.268 --> 34:40.039
If you love the sport,
you will stick with it.

34:40.072 --> 34:41.473
Coaches will come and coaches will go.

34:41.507 --> 34:44.109
What's important is
that you stick with it.

34:44.143 --> 34:46.110
- Well, she hates me!
- Come on.

34:46.146 --> 34:48.414
It's true!
She makes me completely doubt myself!

34:48.447 --> 34:50.114
I'm terrified of her.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.451
Wow, that sounds familiar.

34:52.485 --> 34:54.286
I'm terrified too.

34:54.321 --> 34:58.107
- Why?
- This whole New York thing.

34:58.858 --> 35:01.682
There's no failure like
a New York failure.

35:02.262 --> 35:04.629
How do you know you're gonna fail?

35:05.165 --> 35:09.101
You don't know this but I got
fired from my last job there.

35:09.352 --> 35:13.072
I just... I can't face this
going up in flames too.

35:13.106 --> 35:14.473
Well,
how do you know if you're gonna fail

35:14.507 --> 35:16.508
if you don't even try?

35:16.543 --> 35:20.112
You love Maggie's.
You're the one who can make this work.

35:20.146 --> 35:24.083
You can't not go because you're
scared of how hard it could be.

35:24.117 --> 35:25.948
Now look who's talking.

35:28.722 --> 35:30.255
So you think I should go?

35:30.290 --> 35:32.157
Yeah, you should.

35:35.128 --> 35:37.129
I'll make you deal.

35:37.163 --> 35:38.664
I will face my New York fears

35:38.698 --> 35:41.200
If you stick it out with your coach.

35:41.234 --> 35:42.768
What?

35:45.138 --> 35:46.505
(Sighs)

35:47.520 --> 35:49.308
Okay, deal.

35:50.744 --> 35:52.111
Deal.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.147
Do I look okay?

35:56.583 --> 35:58.350
You look amazing.

35:58.385 --> 36:00.319
(Knock at the door)

36:00.353 --> 36:02.388
Hey, you have a very handsome young man

36:02.422 --> 36:05.491
waiting for you downstairs
and you look lovely.

36:05.525 --> 36:07.326
Thank you.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.361
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

36:11.898 --> 36:15.184
- Oh, um, Mom?
- Yeah?

36:16.503 --> 36:18.837
- Phone.
- Right.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.607
Thanks.

36:23.042 --> 36:24.410
(Sighs)

36:26.579 --> 36:28.180
(Page rustles)

36:39.592 --> 36:41.860
Minnie's pretty calm.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.704
You okay?

36:46.266 --> 36:48.593
I'm starting to get scared.

36:49.369 --> 36:53.052
Lou was right. My dad was right.

36:53.640 --> 36:56.175
Everything's gonna change.

36:56.209 --> 36:59.211
Well, it's bound to, Amy, but...

37:00.136 --> 37:02.314
it's a good thing.

37:02.348 --> 37:04.316
Some of it isn't.

37:05.748 --> 37:08.187
Do you remember my first appointment,

37:08.221 --> 37:10.255
what the doctor said?

37:10.290 --> 37:13.225
This book makes it even clearer.

37:13.259 --> 37:17.507
I can't ride.
They say it's too dangerous.

37:17.697 --> 37:19.765
But that's not even just client horses,

37:19.799 --> 37:21.733
I can't ride Spartan.

37:22.929 --> 37:26.729
I mean, how can I live like that, Ty?
That's who I am.

37:28.418 --> 37:32.962
Amy, come on, that's not who you are.

37:33.546 --> 37:35.547
It's a part of who you are.

37:37.843 --> 37:39.551
Okay?

37:41.788 --> 37:44.089
(Minnie whinnies sharply)

37:45.558 --> 37:47.059
(Latches clank)

37:51.498 --> 37:54.299
(Minnie snorts)

37:54.334 --> 37:57.402
That's a good girl. Good girl. Easy.

37:57.437 --> 38:00.239
- (Wet sounds) Can I help?
- Yup.

38:01.674 --> 38:03.008
- (Wet sounds) Hey Jack?
- Yeah?

38:03.042 --> 38:04.643
The sac's not broken here.

38:04.677 --> 38:06.879
We don't want him to suffocate.
I'll do it for him.

38:06.913 --> 38:08.313
Thank you.

38:08.348 --> 38:10.249
Makes sure his nostrils are clear too.

38:10.283 --> 38:11.650
- There we go.
- There we go. Good job.

38:11.684 --> 38:14.286
- Get him outta there.
- Just pull it off.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.288
(Minnie rumbles)

38:16.322 --> 38:17.689
(Minnie whinnies)

38:17.724 --> 38:20.092
- (Chuckles)
- Good job.

38:20.126 --> 38:21.493
Ty: The next one should be comin'
fast. Good job, good job.

38:21.528 --> 38:22.995
(Minnie whinnies weakly)

38:23.029 --> 38:24.596
Ty: Hold on.

38:25.865 --> 38:27.604
You're okay.

38:28.301 --> 38:30.335
Okay. What's happening?

38:30.370 --> 38:31.770
(Wet sounds)

38:31.804 --> 38:34.306
- Is something wrong?
- Ty: It should be here by now.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.708
(Minnie grunts)

38:36.743 --> 38:39.778
Just hold on, hold on. She's okay.

38:41.981 --> 38:43.348
Amy: (Pants)

38:44.784 --> 38:47.686
- It's coming.
- Yup, she's okay.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.289
Here it comes. (Wet sounds)

38:51.758 --> 38:53.959
- Good girl.
- Yeah, just pull there.

38:53.993 --> 38:55.661
(Minnie snorts) (Grunts)

38:55.695 --> 38:57.396
(Pants) (Wet sounds)

38:58.798 --> 39:00.198
Okay.

39:01.601 --> 39:03.802
Good job!

39:05.271 --> 39:07.706
Georgie: Oh my God, Adam,
she's having her babies!

39:17.784 --> 39:20.752
Why isn't the foal moving?

39:20.787 --> 39:22.321
Ty?

39:27.060 --> 39:29.761
- You're okay.
- Ty: Okay.

39:31.197 --> 39:32.564
- It's okay, we'll help ya.
- Another towel, Lou.

39:32.599 --> 39:34.366
- Come on, you can do it.
- Here grandpa.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.968
- You can do it, come on.
- Here he comes, here he comes.

39:36.002 --> 39:38.370
- We gotcha.
- Come on. Yeah! (Sharp whinny)

39:38.404 --> 39:40.539
