WEBVTT

00:17.475 --> 00:19.560
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God. That's it.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.021
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

00:22.230 --> 00:24.106
You have no respect
for anybody's privacy.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.899
- Rachel, wait.
- No, you wait.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.610
- Can I just say one thing?
- What? What?

00:28.778 --> 00:32.072
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your...

00:32.782 --> 00:35.242
...nippular area.
- Ugh!

01:28.922 --> 01:31.507
Honey, honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

01:31.674 --> 01:33.467
...who thinks things are
other things.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.260
You know?

01:35.595 --> 01:38.514
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower...

01:40.308 --> 01:42.017
That's pretty much it.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.813
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.190
Thanks. Okay.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.984
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.903
Okay. I'll miss you.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.115
Isn't he great?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.617
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.868
I know. I know.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.996
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.625
And for a shrink,
he's not too "shrinky." You know?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.752
So you think you'll do it on his couch?

02:09.002 --> 02:11.755
Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.382
It's vinyl.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.346
- Okay. You guys want anything else?
- Oh, yes.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.098
- Could I have...?
- Sorry, we're all out.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.599
- Anybody else?
- Okay.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.394
Did I, uh, miss something?

02:25.603 --> 02:28.814
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.568
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

02:32.819 --> 02:33.861
It was an accident.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.864
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.492
Can we change the subject, please?

02:40.994 --> 02:44.872
Because, hello? These aren't her
"boobies." These are her breasts.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.501
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

02:50.461 --> 02:54.089
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.550
"Nice"?

02:56.968 --> 02:58.051
They were "nice"?

02:58.303 --> 03:01.054
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

03:02.891 --> 03:05.517
Okay. Rock, hard place...

03:05.727 --> 03:07.144
...me.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.483
You're so funny.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.778
He's really funny.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.908
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.118
Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.663
What did you mean by that?

03:27.582 --> 03:30.792
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

03:31.002 --> 03:34.838
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.132
Huh.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.219
I mean, hey, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.138
Only child, right?

03:44.599 --> 03:46.850
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.562
Uh-huh. How did you know?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.397
It's textbook.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.693
Hey, you guys.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.487
You all know my dad, right?

03:59.197 --> 04:01.406
- How long are you in the city?
- A couple of days.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.699
I got a job midtown.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.785
I figure I'm better off
staying with the kid...

04:04.953 --> 04:07.663
...than hauling my ass back and forth
on the ferry.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.039
I don't know this one.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.375
- Oh. This is my friend Roger.
- Hi.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.210
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.255
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.714
- Dad, uh...
- Oh, oh.

04:18.882 --> 04:19.966
Excuse me.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.843
So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.431
Oh for two, huh? Heh.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.142
Uh, Chandler, quick,
say something funny.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.029
Gotta go. Ha, ha.
I miss you too.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.365
I love you,
but it's getting late now...

04:43.616 --> 04:45.242
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.

04:45.493 --> 04:49.162
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and...

04:50.248 --> 04:51.456
Excuse me?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.503
Did you know this isn't Ma?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.722
Her name's Ronni.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.891
She's a pet mortician.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.230
Sure.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.358
So how long have you been...

05:20.486 --> 05:23.363
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the Navy yard...

05:23.531 --> 05:24.990
...and show you the big ships?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.994
- Since then?
- No, it's only been six years.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.871
I wanted to give you
a nice memory...

05:31.122 --> 05:34.333
...so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.338
Joe, have you ever been in love?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.090
I don't know.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.217
Then you haven't.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.804
- You're burning your tomatoes.
- Hmm. You're one to talk.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.351
Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.354
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.648
Oh, man. Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.818
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.121
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out...

06:13.331 --> 06:15.457
...your dad was
leading this double life.

06:15.666 --> 06:19.669
He's, like, actually some spy
working for the CIA.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.588
That'd be cool.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.840
This blows.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.970
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.139
Why do they
have to become people?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.308
Why do they have...?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.811
Why...

06:37.063 --> 06:40.357
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

06:41.776 --> 06:46.363
What?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.950
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

06:50.201 --> 06:51.576
All right, we're all adults here.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.579
There's only one way
to resolve this.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.331
Since you saw her boobies...

06:56.541 --> 06:59.084
...I think, uh, you're gonna have to
show her your pee-pee.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.971
You know,
I don't see that happening.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.516
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.898
Well I'm not showing you my tat.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.027
Hello?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.488
- It's Phoebe.
- And Rog.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.907
Come on up.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.119
Oh, good. Rog is here.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.540
- What's the matter with Rog?
- Nothing. It's a little thing.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.584
I hate that guy.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.880
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.007
Come on, he's not that bad.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.010
That's where you're wrong.
Why would I marry her...

07:50.219 --> 07:53.054
...if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.390
I don't know.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.350
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.441
- Ha, ha.
- Why? Why would I? Why?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.485
Why? Why? Why?

08:06.736 --> 08:10.655
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

08:10.865 --> 08:14.868
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe...

08:15.036 --> 08:17.913
Wait.
Go back to that "sibling" thing.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.832
Well, I don't know.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.211
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage...

08:24.462 --> 08:28.089
...so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.722
That's ridiculous.
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.186
- Oh, so you think I'm a failure?
- Isn't he good?

08:41.395 --> 08:44.689
Yeah. No.
That's not what I was saying.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.942
All these years,
I thought you were on my side...

08:47.193 --> 08:49.528
...but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad...

08:49.737 --> 08:50.862
...so they'd favor you.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.490
Hey, I married a lesbian
to make you look good.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.621
You're right.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.289
I mean, you're right.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.293
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace...

09:08.047 --> 09:10.257
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

09:10.508 --> 09:14.427
...which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.472
That's tough, tough stuff.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.101
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.978
Okay. Feel better, okay?

09:23.187 --> 09:25.063
- We're gonna be late, sweetie.
- Okay.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.108
- Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
- No problem.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.235
It was great seeing you again.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.824
Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.201
Remember, they're just food...

09:38.452 --> 09:39.828
...they're not love.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.917
I hate that guy.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.880
Good night, you guys.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.553
Oh, look.
It's the woman we ordered.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.976
Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you?

10:03.352 --> 10:06.479
Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.399
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.236
Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.487
Oh, my God.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.365
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.536
I'm Ronni.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.790
Cheese Nip?

10:27.877 --> 10:30.337
Uh, Joey's having an embolism...

10:30.963 --> 10:32.213
...but I'd go for a Nip.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.015
You see, most people,
when their pets pass on...

10:42.183 --> 10:44.893
...they want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

10:45.102 --> 10:48.271
But occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.232
Like, uh, chasing their tail.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.236
Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.948
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.203
- That's a good one.
- Hey, Joe.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.954
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.456
- Huh?
- Hi.

11:06.707 --> 11:07.916
- Hey.
RONNl: Hey.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.626
Hello, babe.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.796
What are...? What are you doing here?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.757
Oh, uh, you left your hair
at my apartment.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.385
I figured you'd need it
for your meeting.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.263
Thank you. Uh...

11:24.392 --> 11:26.851
So who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

11:31.315 --> 11:32.440
Look, I, uh...

11:32.817 --> 11:34.317
I shouldn't have come.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.986
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.280
No, I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.866
- Where am I gonna stay? Here?
- Whoa.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.913
We'll go to a hotel.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.458
- No, you won't.
- No, we won't.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.586
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.756
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.633
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

11:58.843 --> 11:59.884
That's right, mister.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.595
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here...

12:02.847 --> 12:05.265
...you're gonna live by my rules.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.771
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.066
Wow, he's strict.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.776
Dad, you'll be in my room.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.029
Ronni, uh, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.657
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.909
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.498
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."

12:34.712 --> 12:38.131
Okay. This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.884
- Six years is long enough.
- What kind of change?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.094
- Break up with Ronni...
- I can't.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.972
Then come clean with Ma.
This is not right.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.225
I don't wanna hear it.
Now go to my room.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.908
Hey, kickie.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.121
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get comfortable.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.249
- I can't sleep in my underwear.
- Well, you're gonna.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.382
I've been thinking...

13:21.634 --> 13:24.928
...about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.184
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.771
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.857
I always figured, when
the right one comes along...

13:38.067 --> 13:41.402
...I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance, you know?

13:41.612 --> 13:44.030
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.658
You're not him, you're you.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.412
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

13:51.664 --> 13:52.705
- No.
- No.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.250
You decided to go into
the out-of-work-actor business.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.587
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.216
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along...

14:03.425 --> 14:05.343
...you'll have the guts to say:

14:05.553 --> 14:06.970
"No thanks, I'm married."

14:13.769 --> 14:14.978
You really think so?

14:15.479 --> 14:17.313
Yeah. I really do.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.148
- Thanks, Chandler.
- Get off.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.329
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.581
May I help you?

14:34.748 --> 14:38.501
Uh, Joey said I could use your shower
since, uh, Chandler's in ours.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.254
Okay. Who are you?

14:41.589 --> 14:44.799
- Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
- Uh-huh.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.968
The mistress?

14:48.679 --> 14:50.889
- Um, come on in.
- Thanks.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.057
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.309
Hey, Ronni.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.686
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.688
Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.065
Perfect.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.861
Fasten your seat belts...

15:05.070 --> 15:06.696
...it's pee-pee time.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.995
Hey, Mr. Trib.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.914
Hey. Good morning, dear.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.711
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.893
- What's the matter with you?
- I thought it was Chandler.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.813
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.276
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.035
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.621
- How's it going?
- Good. Oh, oh.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.540
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.547
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.424
It's just that, uh...

16:09.426 --> 16:10.510
It's Roger.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.513
Um, ahem, I don't know.
There's something about... Ahem.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.974
Basically, we just feel
that he's, uh...

16:16.225 --> 16:17.266
We hate that guy.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.726
We hate him.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.478
We're sorry, Pheebs.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.980
Uh-huh. Okay.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.566
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive...

16:25.818 --> 16:27.443
...that it freaked you out?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.445
- No, I hate him.
- No, we hate him.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.822
I'm sorry.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.795
Ma. What are you doing here?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.047
I came to give you this...

16:48.298 --> 16:49.549
...and this.
- Ow.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.259
Big ring.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.554
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage...

16:54.805 --> 16:57.432
...about making things right?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.934
Things were fine the way they were.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.854
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.982
For God's sake, Joey.
Really.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.986
Hold on. You knew?

17:10.194 --> 17:12.571
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

17:12.823 --> 17:15.199
Your father is no James Bond.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.285
You should have heard
his cover stories.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.787
"I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's."

17:20.039 --> 17:22.290
I mean, what is that?
Please.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.375
So then, how could you...?

17:24.585 --> 17:27.086
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

17:27.337 --> 17:31.549
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.511
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.263
Now he's happy.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.099
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.022
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but...

17:46.440 --> 17:47.940
...what the hell
are you talking about?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.612
- I mean, what about you?
- Me? I'm fine.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.614
Look, honey...

17:54.990 --> 17:57.075
...in an ideal world...

17:57.367 --> 18:00.536
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.582
And I'll tell you something else:

18:04.792 --> 18:08.169
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

18:08.420 --> 18:12.715
...he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.801
He's been more loving.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.553
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.181
I'm happy for you?

18:20.390 --> 18:21.599
Well, don't be.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.519
Because now everything's screwed up.

18:26.021 --> 18:30.274
I just want it the way it was.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.402
Ma, I'm sorry.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.115
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.285
I know you did, cookie.
Oh, I know you did.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.665
So tell me...

18:47.042 --> 18:48.167
Did you see her?

18:49.711 --> 18:50.795
Yeah.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.340
You're 10 times prettier
than she is.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.883
That's sweet.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.970
Could I take her?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.974
With this ring, no contest.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.397
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- Nothing.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.150
No, no. What's wrong? Come on.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.776
Okay.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.781
It's nothing. I'm fine.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.950
It's just, um...
It's my friends.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.870
They have a liking problem with you...

19:24.121 --> 19:25.329
...in that, um...

19:25.581 --> 19:26.956
...they don't.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.752
Oh. They don't?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.046
But you know...

19:34.298 --> 19:37.091
...they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.845
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.638
They think you're a little...

19:43.515 --> 19:46.100
- What?
- Intense and creepy.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.854
Oh.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.648
But I don't. Me. Phoebe.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.111
Well, I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.739
You're not?
See, that's why you're so great.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.241
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior...

20:02.492 --> 20:06.662
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.498
You know, this kind of codependent...

20:09.750 --> 20:11.375
...emotionally stunted...

20:11.668 --> 20:16.797
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

20:17.049 --> 20:20.384
...which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

20:21.845 --> 20:26.307
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me. Define me.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.310
Love me. I need love."

20:30.812 --> 20:32.438
So you talked to your dad, huh?

20:32.648 --> 20:35.691
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.527
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know even though she does.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.530
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore...

20:41.782 --> 20:43.824
...because he got
a restraining order.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.079
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.288
Wow.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.083
Things sure have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.419
So, Joey, are you okay?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.171
Yeah, I guess.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.674
It's just...
You know, they're parents.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.885
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.762
Even if you know better...

21:04.972 --> 21:07.473
...you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.724
And just think...

21:08.934 --> 21:11.060
...in a couple years,
we get to turn into them.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.687
Oh, please.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.523
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond...

21:15.691 --> 21:18.776
...chasing after 20-year-old boys...

21:19.027 --> 21:20.820
...or I'll end up like my mom.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.867
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.536
How's it going?

21:29.663 --> 21:32.039
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.791
Oh.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.126
Yeah, right.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.920
No, no, really. Aw.

21:39.214 --> 21:42.925
- What happened?
- Ugh. I don't know. I mean...

21:43.135 --> 21:44.635
He's a good person...

21:44.886 --> 21:46.762
...and he can be really sweet.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.266
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.935
It's just, I hate that guy.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.112
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

22:03.363 --> 22:05.990
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.034
Next stop, Rachel Green.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.751
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

22:17.252 --> 22:19.545
Sorry, wrong boobies.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.893
Hello, Joey.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.645
Hello, dear.
