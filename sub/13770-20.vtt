WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.211
Guys, look, I like you both.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.213
You work hard,

00:03.253 --> 00:05.213
but you gotta realize

00:05.255 --> 00:07.424
how other people

00:05.255 --> 00:07.424
see this relationship.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.677
Dude ranches have a lot

00:07.466 --> 00:09.677
of conservative customers,

00:09.718 --> 00:12.429
so, even though I personally

00:09.718 --> 00:12.429
don't have a problem

00:12.471 --> 00:15.516
with you two as a couple,

00:12.471 --> 00:15.516
this has to stop.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.059
(mooing)

00:18.101 --> 00:20.896
Thunder,

00:18.101 --> 00:20.896
get back in your own stall.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.067
(mooing)

00:26.109 --> 00:29.697
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:30.948 --> 00:32.867
Dewey, I just found

00:30.948 --> 00:32.867
this letter!

00:32.908 --> 00:35.870
It says your school's going

00:32.908 --> 00:35.870
to have a father-son 5K race,

00:35.911 --> 00:37.245
and it was in the trash.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.080
I wanted to save you the trouble

00:37.287 --> 00:39.080
of agreeing to do it

00:39.122 --> 00:40.875
and then coming up

00:39.122 --> 00:40.875
with a bunch of lame excuses

00:40.916 --> 00:42.376
when you don't show up.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.253
It's degrading for you and even

00:42.417 --> 00:45.253
though I should know better,

00:45.295 --> 00:47.255
still slightly disappointing

00:45.295 --> 00:47.255
for me.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.258
Come on, I'm not that bad.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.468
Last week you missed my class

00:51.510 --> 00:54.471
performing an original

00:51.510 --> 00:54.471
one-act play that I wrote.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.931
Well, I was there yesterday

00:55.973 --> 00:58.099
when the mayor presented you

00:55.973 --> 00:58.099
with an award for it.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.393
No, you weren't.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.603
Well, I saw every second

00:59.434 --> 01:01.603
of the video.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.982
Look, son,

01:01.645 --> 01:04.982
I am going to be at that race.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.901
REESE:

01:05.024 --> 01:06.901
Okay, if you say so.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.485
I'll check.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.030
Mom, do you want to talk to dead

01:08.527 --> 01:11.030
Grandpa's secret other family?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.280
What did you say?

01:12.322 --> 01:13.949
This lady says she's your sister

01:12.322 --> 01:13.949
and she wants to talk to you.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.118
Make it fast, I have a radio

01:13.991 --> 01:17.118
station in Hawaii on hold.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.038
Hello?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.121
Hello, Lois.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.123
This is Roberta from Manitoba.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.125
Your sister?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
Halfway.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.713
God, this is weird.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.172
Hi. Um...

01:29.214 --> 01:30.716
What's up?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.009
You know,

01:30.758 --> 01:32.009
your mom's lawsuit is over.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.844
I hope you know I didn't

01:32.051 --> 01:33.844
have anything to do with that.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.220
Please-- I tried to talk her

01:33.886 --> 01:35.220
out of it,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.014
but she just wouldn't listen.

01:37.056 --> 01:39.140
And I'm so sorry she gave your

01:37.056 --> 01:39.140
phone number to those prisoners.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.643
Well, it's all water

01:39.182 --> 01:41.643
under the bridge.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.145
It's just, now that

01:41.685 --> 01:44.145
the court case is over,

01:44.187 --> 01:46.440
it just felt weird

01:44.187 --> 01:46.440
to have family

01:46.481 --> 01:48.191
that I didn't ever talk to.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.819
So, now I am.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.195
Talking.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.740
Uh, not very well, apparently.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.075
(clears throat)

01:56.116 --> 01:56.951
God, where is

01:56.992 --> 01:58.159
my diet root beer?

01:58.201 --> 02:00.328
You drink diet root beer?

02:00.370 --> 02:03.164
I drink diet root beer, too.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.165
I'm telling you, Hal,

02:04.207 --> 02:06.334
it is uncanny

02:04.207 --> 02:06.334
how much we are alike.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.545
We both have five letters

02:06.376 --> 02:08.545
in our middle name!

02:08.587 --> 02:10.631
We both like movies

02:08.587 --> 02:10.631
about English ladies

02:10.672 --> 02:12.173
living in

02:10.672 --> 02:12.173
tropical countries.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.675
We have the same ring size,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.594
and we both hope

02:13.717 --> 02:15.594
to go skiing one day!

02:15.636 --> 02:18.388
Wow. Make sure I get

02:15.636 --> 02:18.388
the right one back.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.181
I wish I could come.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.224
Although, obviously,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.352
not as much as I want

02:21.266 --> 02:24.352
to go racing with Dewey.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.813
(laughing):

02:24.394 --> 02:25.813
Right, sport?

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
Wouldn't it be pretty

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
to think so.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.399
(Jamie wailing)

02:29.441 --> 02:31.777
Get ready for

02:29.441 --> 02:31.777
21 hours of this.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.655
Reese, you put him in his seat

02:31.819 --> 02:34.655
face down!

02:34.696 --> 02:36.615
(phone ringing)

02:36.657 --> 02:38.075
Hello?

02:38.117 --> 02:39.118
Oh, hi, Mom.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.577
I lost the case.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.998
They said I was never legally

02:40.619 --> 02:43.998
married to Victor

02:44.039 --> 02:45.206
because there were no documents.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.207
Oh, that judge had guts

02:46.249 --> 02:48.209
after what I mailed him.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.252
That's very sad, Mom.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.295
Not married!

02:50.337 --> 02:51.588
Victor came to my house

02:51.630 --> 02:54.299
and defeated each of my brothers

02:51.630 --> 02:54.299
in combat.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.385
The proof was the bite marks

02:54.341 --> 02:57.385
on his back!

02:57.427 --> 02:59.220
Mom, I really don't want

02:57.427 --> 02:59.220
to hear this again.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.221
My life is horrible!

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
I can't think of anything

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
but death.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.102
I thought I'd come down tomorrow

03:02.265 --> 03:05.102
for a visit.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.227
What?!

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
You want to come see us

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
tomorrow?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.230
(quietly):

03:08.313 --> 03:09.230
Birthday party for Jamie.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.025
Mother, that's a great idea.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.233
We would love to see you

03:12.275 --> 03:14.444
because tomorrow

03:12.275 --> 03:14.444
is Jamie's birthday.

03:14.486 --> 03:18.073
And there are going to be kids

03:14.486 --> 03:18.073
here, and balloons and songs...

03:18.115 --> 03:20.868
I just remembered.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.868
Tomorrow I'm getting waxed.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.752
I can't ring

03:29.168 --> 03:30.752
the doorbell.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.670
It's too weird.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.629
You can do it.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.255
Canadian doorbells

03:32.671 --> 03:34.255
work just like ours.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.256
No, Reese,

03:35.298 --> 03:36.758
I mean it's strange.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.260
These people have

03:36.800 --> 03:39.260
the same DNA as us.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.055
It's kind of spooky.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.263
Don't be so freaked out, Mom.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.724
There's nothing spooky

03:42.305 --> 03:43.724
about this.

03:48.812 --> 03:49.855
You must be Lois.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.023
And I bet

03:51.065 --> 03:53.274
that you're

03:51.065 --> 03:53.274
Reese and Malcolm and Jamie.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.194
Oh, I'm so glad

03:53.316 --> 03:55.194
you're all here.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.486
Come in, come in!

03:58.113 --> 03:59.280
So, is Dad's oth...?

03:59.322 --> 04:03.284
Uh... I mean, is Victor...?

04:03.326 --> 04:04.995
Is your mother here?

04:05.037 --> 04:06.163
Oh, yes.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.288
But she's really, uh...

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
They shouldn't

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
have come...

04:09.332 --> 04:12.211
until I've had time

04:09.332 --> 04:12.211
to finish the cookies.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.046
And my hair is just a mess!

04:15.589 --> 04:18.425
You look just like your father!

04:19.342 --> 04:21.720
Well, we're all thinking it.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.016
I don't care

04:22.596 --> 04:26.016
how uncomfortable this is.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.768
Give me a hug!

04:31.354 --> 04:34.524
Wow. Grandpa really

04:31.354 --> 04:34.524
went for old women.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.484
Genes are weird.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.611
Reese and I are brothers,

04:37.652 --> 04:39.487
and we're barely

04:37.652 --> 04:39.487
in the same species.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.781
But Jerome is my half-cousin,

04:40.822 --> 04:42.741
and we look the same,

04:40.822 --> 04:42.741
we stand the same,

04:42.783 --> 04:45.160
and we're already talking

04:42.783 --> 04:45.160
like we're best friends.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.205
Malcolm, you're describing

04:45.202 --> 04:48.205
an ontology of modality

04:48.247 --> 04:49.497
that's completely

04:48.247 --> 04:49.497
consistent.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.332
As consistent as logicism.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
(both laughing)

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
And he's funny!

04:54.377 --> 04:55.503
Hey, Malcolm,

04:55.545 --> 04:56.964
I'm gonna take your brother

04:55.545 --> 04:56.964
goose hunting.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.715
You're taking

04:57.005 --> 04:58.715
Reese  hunting?

04:58.757 --> 05:00.801
Yeah, you know, he says

04:58.757 --> 05:00.801
he's never held a gun before,

05:00.842 --> 05:03.762
but, boy, he seems

05:00.842 --> 05:03.762
like a natural with it.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.348
God, I hope the zombies

05:03.804 --> 05:07.348
attack today.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.850
So, how's your school?

05:08.892 --> 05:09.977
Okay, I guess.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.353
They've got me

05:10.018 --> 05:12.353
in this accelerated program.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.521
Me, too.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.190
It kind of sucks.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.357
Yeah. It's great being

05:15.232 --> 05:16.357
so popular,

05:16.399 --> 05:17.859
but every group of friends

05:16.399 --> 05:17.859
you're in

05:17.901 --> 05:19.527
expects you to go

05:17.901 --> 05:19.527
to all their parties,

05:19.569 --> 05:21.362
which is, like,

05:19.569 --> 05:21.362
physically impossible.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.782
Yeah. Impossible.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.826
Not to mention juggling

05:23.824 --> 05:25.826
homework, hockey practice,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.368
being president

05:25.867 --> 05:27.368
of the student body,

05:27.410 --> 05:28.954
and still trying to find

05:27.410 --> 05:28.954
enough time

05:28.996 --> 05:29.663
for your girlfriend.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.539
Oh, I have to call her.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.835
I'm clinging to a slight hope

05:31.581 --> 05:34.835
that she's imaginary.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.627
Hey, it's me.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.587
You did

05:35.669 --> 05:37.587
get the flowers.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.380
I'm glad you liked them.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.008
If we were born

05:39.422 --> 05:41.008
so much alike,

05:41.049 --> 05:43.218
why is he so much

05:41.049 --> 05:43.218
happier than me?

05:43.260 --> 05:45.553
Were you talking to

05:43.260 --> 05:45.553
that cute girlfriend of yours?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.388
Wait. You know what?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.390
That's none of my business.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.392
Oh.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.395
Sylvia, Roberta,

05:51.434 --> 05:54.395
your house is so lovely.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.190
It's just beautiful,

05:56.231 --> 05:58.399
and everything is so fancy.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.776
Well, thank you.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.070
I can't take much

05:59.818 --> 06:02.070
credit for it, though.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.197
You know Victor.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.405
He loved to spoil us.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.991
Oh, look,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.408
the lake house.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.703
I think that's the

06:07.450 --> 06:09.703
summer we nursed

06:09.744 --> 06:12.289
a heron back to health.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.208
Oh, it's beautiful.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.583
Here's one of the tool shed.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
One time we killed

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
a wasp nest inside it.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.420
Look at this one.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.631
You girls are dressed

06:19.462 --> 06:21.631
like hoboes.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.218
Oh, was that

06:21.673 --> 06:24.218
a fun costume party?

06:24.259 --> 06:29.097
Yeah. Really fun. And long.

06:29.139 --> 06:33.434
Here's another one of Dad

06:29.139 --> 06:33.434
doing his pretend angry face.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.729
And you doing

06:33.476 --> 06:35.729
a pretend sad face.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.480
I don't think

06:35.770 --> 06:37.480
you guys are serious

06:37.522 --> 06:38.481
in one of these photos.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.026
That's us--

06:38.523 --> 06:41.026
just a couple of kidders.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.113
You know, I can't get over

06:41.068 --> 06:45.113
how happy and friendly Dad looks

06:45.155 --> 06:47.324
in picture after picture

06:45.155 --> 06:47.324
after picture.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.367
Well, you know,

06:48.407 --> 06:50.160
Victor wasn't perfect.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.452
Sometimes

06:50.202 --> 06:51.452
he'd come home

06:51.494 --> 06:52.704
a little grumpy.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.083
But I'd sit him down,

06:52.746 --> 06:56.083
we'd talk it out,

06:56.124 --> 06:57.834
and before

06:56.124 --> 06:57.834
you knew it,

06:57.876 --> 06:59.502
he'd be laughing and joking

06:59.544 --> 07:01.922
and giving the girls

06:59.544 --> 07:01.922
hugs and kisses.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.008
You know, I think I need

07:01.963 --> 07:05.008
a little fresh air.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.390
Boy, this is weird.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.850
I keep thinking about why...

07:13.892 --> 07:15.685
things turn out the way they do.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.855
It's amazing how different

07:15.727 --> 07:18.855
your life could be

07:18.897 --> 07:21.482
if you just...

07:18.897 --> 07:21.482
changed one person.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.485
Tell me about it.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.489
You know what

07:25.820 --> 07:28.489
else is strange?

07:28.531 --> 07:29.490
What?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
Have you heard a bird

07:30.784 --> 07:32.493
or a cricket or anything

07:30.784 --> 07:32.493
in the last two minutes?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.956
No. Everything's gone

07:32.535 --> 07:35.956
as quiet as a graveyard.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.498
(both gasping)

07:39.542 --> 07:42.503
Judas!

07:47.717 --> 07:49.886
Mother, what are

07:47.717 --> 07:49.886
you doing here?!

07:49.928 --> 07:53.514
"Oh, Mommy, I'd love you to come

07:49.928 --> 07:53.514
to my baby's party."

07:53.556 --> 07:55.309
Do you think

07:53.556 --> 07:55.309
I was born yesterday?

07:55.350 --> 07:56.726
I could spot lies

07:56.768 --> 07:59.354
coming out of your mouth

07:56.768 --> 07:59.354
since before it had teeth in it.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.898
(sotto voce):

07:59.396 --> 08:01.898
Lock the door.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.400
Ha!

08:03.442 --> 08:04.525
Oh, my God, Mother,

08:03.442 --> 08:04.525
she's inside!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.527
Lock yourself in the den.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.155
I'll call the police.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.534
(doors closing and locking)

08:13.576 --> 08:17.038
So, Lois... are

08:13.576 --> 08:17.038
you enjoying your...

08:17.080 --> 08:18.248
collaboration?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.917
Looks like you sold your soul

08:18.290 --> 08:20.917
cheap enough.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.545
Coconut cake-- from the woman

08:20.959 --> 08:24.545
who stole your father's fluids

08:24.587 --> 08:26.465
and made bastards with them!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.549
Mother, what the hell

08:26.506 --> 08:28.549
are you doing?!

08:28.591 --> 08:30.218
Get out of here!

08:28.591 --> 08:30.218
The police are coming!

08:30.260 --> 08:33.054
Why? I don't even get to look

08:30.260 --> 08:33.054
at what was stolen from me?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.556
Where do you think

08:33.096 --> 08:35.556
she got this money?

08:35.598 --> 08:38.143
This couch was my trip to Paris!

08:38.185 --> 08:40.354
Look at this place.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.354
While we lived like dogs,

08:40.395 --> 08:44.941
they were playing

08:40.395 --> 08:44.941
on grand pianos and

08:40.395 --> 08:44.941
eating with napkins!

08:44.983 --> 08:46.485
Why do you

08:44.983 --> 08:46.485
think you girls

08:46.526 --> 08:47.568
were so short and ugly?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.946
Victor fed you on beans

08:47.610 --> 08:49.946
so he could give

08:49.988 --> 08:52.824
his other daughter

08:49.988 --> 08:52.824
ballet lessons.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
Ida, I think you

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
should know

08:54.242 --> 08:56.370
that besides the

08:54.242 --> 08:56.370
restraining order,

08:56.411 --> 08:58.038
I have a knitting needle.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.581
All right, it's a crochet hook.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.876
Listen to me, tough guy.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.587
I know about Victor's

09:02.917 --> 09:06.587
other pension!

09:06.629 --> 09:08.048
Victor worked

09:08.089 --> 09:12.469
for Paragon Brush

09:08.089 --> 09:12.469
from 1960 to 1964.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.470
Manitoba family law

09:13.512 --> 09:15.596
says as common-law wife,

09:15.638 --> 09:18.058
I am entitled to that pension!

09:18.099 --> 09:20.601
I really don't know

09:18.099 --> 09:20.601
what you're talking about.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.604
The truth will burst

09:20.643 --> 09:23.604
out of the grave

09:23.646 --> 09:26.525
and strangle you

09:23.646 --> 09:26.525
and your whole family!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.609
(sotto voce):

09:26.566 --> 09:28.609
Mother, we will

09:26.566 --> 09:28.609
discuss this later.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.610
If you do not turn

09:28.651 --> 09:29.610
and leave,

09:29.652 --> 09:30.778
so help me,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.406
I will tear that wig

09:30.820 --> 09:32.406
off of your head,

09:32.447 --> 09:34.908
(louder):

09:32.447 --> 09:34.908
and everyone will see

09:32.447 --> 09:34.908
your tick scars!

09:39.662 --> 09:42.249
It's not over.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.421
Canada is the greatest nation

09:43.833 --> 09:47.421
on the face of the earth!

09:47.462 --> 09:48.629
Hey, Grandma.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.631
I can't believe

09:48.671 --> 09:50.631
I've never been hunting before.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.674
Nature

09:50.673 --> 09:51.674
is so complex

09:51.716 --> 09:54.553
and beautiful...

09:51.716 --> 09:54.553
and bad at hiding.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.430
Never again.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.472
He was...

09:57.514 --> 09:58.932
It was...

09:58.973 --> 10:01.351
The horrible laughter.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.519
Thanks, man.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.895
I'm not going

10:02.561 --> 10:03.895
to need this anymore.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.689
Next time I want to make

10:03.937 --> 10:06.689
a little eye contact.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.568
All right, the

10:07.690 --> 10:09.568
race is in two days.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.069
Let's get out

10:09.609 --> 10:11.069
there and practice.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.029
Where do we keep

10:11.111 --> 10:13.029
the sports bottles?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.115
Do we really need props

10:13.071 --> 10:15.115
for this charade?

10:15.156 --> 10:18.659
Hey, when did your mom

10:15.156 --> 10:18.659
get a fire extinguisher?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.495
Uh, Dad,

10:18.701 --> 10:20.495
you probably don't want to...

10:20.537 --> 10:21.871
Why would she hide this from me?

10:34.593 --> 10:35.676
Yeah, Mom.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.844
He found it.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.889
The doctor says

10:36.886 --> 10:39.889
two weeks.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.600
Bye.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.269
I have to admit

10:42.725 --> 10:44.269
you almost had me fooled.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.854
I really thought you were going

10:44.311 --> 10:46.854
to come through this time.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.982
Dewey, it was an accident.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.526
Believe me, if I wanted

10:49.023 --> 10:51.526
to blind myself,

10:51.568 --> 10:54.695
there are 100 easier ways

10:51.568 --> 10:54.695
I could have done it.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.281
Knowing that

10:54.737 --> 10:56.281
I let you down

10:56.323 --> 10:58.699
hurts much more

10:56.323 --> 10:58.699
than burnt corneas.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.910
And they hurt a lot.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.497
I hate breaking a promise

11:00.952 --> 11:03.497
to you, Dewey,

11:03.538 --> 11:04.705
I really do.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.291
That's the truth.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.084
I remember once

11:06.333 --> 11:08.084
when my dad told me

11:08.126 --> 11:10.629
he was going to take me

11:08.126 --> 11:10.629
to an air show.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.713
Jerome's amazing.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
He was born with

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
the same brain as me,

11:14.757 --> 11:16.551
but he used it

11:14.757 --> 11:16.551
to become friends

11:16.593 --> 11:17.718
with the kind

11:16.593 --> 11:17.718
of popular,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.513
well-adjusted people

11:17.760 --> 11:19.513
who hate me.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.514
You're right.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.722
Nobody cares about

11:20.555 --> 11:21.722
student council.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.225
But I say what's bad

11:21.764 --> 11:24.225
about getting together,

11:24.267 --> 11:25.560
planting a few trees

11:25.602 --> 11:26.645
and making the school

11:26.685 --> 11:28.729
a little more pleasant

11:26.685 --> 11:28.729
for everyone?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.524
Wow. Jerome took

11:28.771 --> 11:30.524
something seriously

11:30.565 --> 11:32.108
and didn't

11:30.565 --> 11:32.108
get laughed at.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.570
That's like the triple Lutz

11:32.150 --> 11:35.570
of high school socializing.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.659
I'm glad it's

11:38.072 --> 11:40.659
him, not me!

11:41.493 --> 11:43.620
(laughing)

11:47.040 --> 11:49.917
Why couldn't that be me?

11:49.959 --> 11:52.753
Hey, don't forget

11:49.959 --> 11:52.753
about tomorrow night--

11:49.959 --> 11:52.753
karaoke party.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.838
You do karaoke?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.131
Yeah, you should come.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.924
Uh, karaoke's not my thing.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.468
I mean, you

11:56.966 --> 11:58.468
can probably sing.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.637
No, I can't.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.637
I'm terrible.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.762
Then why do you do it?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.848
Aren't you afraid you'll

12:01.804 --> 12:03.848
look like a total idiot?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.559
Hey, if you're afraid

12:03.890 --> 12:05.559
of looking stupid,

12:05.600 --> 12:06.934
you'll never have any fun.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.649
He's forgetting about fun

12:08.727 --> 12:12.649
at someone else's expense.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.652
God, he's so much better

12:12.691 --> 12:15.652
than me.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.986
We froze

12:15.694 --> 12:16.986
Victor's pension

12:17.028 --> 12:18.988
because of the dispute

12:17.028 --> 12:18.988
with the other family.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.615
But you're absolutely right,

12:20.657 --> 12:21.575
Manitoba law states

12:21.616 --> 12:22.783
that a common-law wife

12:22.825 --> 12:24.785
is entitled

12:22.825 --> 12:24.785
to her husband's pension.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.373
And even if the other family

12:24.827 --> 12:28.373
isn't willing to sign a release,

12:28.415 --> 12:29.999
you would probably prevail

12:28.415 --> 12:29.999
in court.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.587
Of course, you'd have to prove

12:30.041 --> 12:33.587
you're a common-law wife

12:33.628 --> 12:34.962
with DNA tests of children,

12:35.004 --> 12:38.383
lease in both your names,

12:35.004 --> 12:38.383
phone bills, that sort of thing.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.467
But I think you'd win.

12:39.509 --> 12:43.888
Finally, a Canadian

12:39.509 --> 12:43.888
who isn't an idiot.

12:43.930 --> 12:48.518
The problem is, the pension's

12:43.930 --> 12:48.518
only $43.50 a month.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.810
Canadian.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.606
And what with hiring a lawyer,

12:52.647 --> 12:54.399
court costs, other expenses...

12:54.441 --> 12:56.984
it would all cost so much,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.984
I don't see you breaking even

12:57.026 --> 12:59.904
for 20 or 30 years.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.199
Do you think

13:01.239 --> 13:03.199
you'll live that long?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.618
God, no!

13:04.659 --> 13:08.455
I mean... no.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.498
I'm really sorry.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
Look, just so today

13:15.712 --> 13:18.047

Okay, Mom,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.222

13:26.264 --> 13:27.515
Let's go.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.683
No.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.101
We're going to do this.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.018
What?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.228
Were you listening?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.317
We're gonna get a lawyer.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.277
Do you really hate

13:37.358 --> 13:39.277
these people so much

13:39.319 --> 13:41.112

13:39.319 --> 13:41.112
to ruin yourself

13:41.154 --> 13:42.739
just to get

13:41.154 --> 13:42.739
even with them?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.865
It's stupid.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.911
He was my husband.

Well, uh, third.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.517
(doorbell ringing)

14:10.558 --> 14:13.478
Hello, Lois, dear.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.521
My mom's not here.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.273
Look, Sylvia, it turns out

14:17.315 --> 14:19.776
there is a pension--

14:17.315 --> 14:19.776
a tiny one.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.901
$40 a month.

14:20.943 --> 14:21.986
Is that all?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.697
Yes, and my mom's all

14:22.028 --> 14:23.697
worked up about it,

14:23.738 --> 14:25.281
and she's willing

14:23.738 --> 14:25.281
to waste all her money

14:25.323 --> 14:26.533
on a court fight to get it.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.908
Oh, dear.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
So, I was wondering

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
if you'd be nice enough

14:29.952 --> 14:31.912
to just sign a release

14:29.952 --> 14:31.912

14:31.954 --> 14:34.541
Oh, I don't see that

14:31.954 --> 14:34.541
ever happening.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.544
Good-bye, dear.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.544
But you people got everything.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.338

14:37.585 --> 14:40.338

14:40.380 --> 14:41.922
She's just looking

14:40.380 --> 14:41.922
for some way

14:41.964 --> 14:43.299
to feel connected

14:41.964 --> 14:43.299
to her husband.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.634
You mean  my  husband.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.597

14:55.353 --> 14:57.355

14:57.397 --> 14:59.940
Oh, yeah, that's right.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.940
That's right. Try and hide!

14:59.982 --> 15:02.235

15:09.992 --> 15:12.871

15:12.912 --> 15:14.205

15:14.247 --> 15:17.792

15:24.298 --> 15:26.843
if this thing does go to trial,

15:26.885 --> 15:27.968
it might help us

15:28.010 --> 15:30.430
if you worked a little bit

15:28.010 --> 15:30.430
on your demeanor.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.431
You know,

15:31.472 --> 15:33.474
when you deal with other people,

15:33.516 --> 15:36.143
you could be pleasant

15:33.516 --> 15:36.143
and say, "How are you?"

15:36.185 --> 15:37.478
And that way

15:36.185 --> 15:37.478
people will think

15:37.520 --> 15:39.146
that you care

15:37.520 --> 15:39.146
about their feelings,

15:39.188 --> 15:40.981
and then

15:39.188 --> 15:40.981
they might care about yours.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.818
What the hell

15:41.023 --> 15:43.818

16:04.672 --> 16:05.465
What's that?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.007
It's the results

16:05.506 --> 16:07.007
of the blood test

16:07.049 --> 16:09.719
that lawyer wanted me to take.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.473
This says paternity

16:09.761 --> 16:13.473
is genetically impossible.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.059
This says

16:14.432 --> 16:17.059
that Dad is not my father!

16:19.771 --> 16:23.023
I was 80% sure you were his.

I dragged him to the bedroom.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.407
I guess his soldiers

16:28.655 --> 16:31.407
got outflanked.

something like that?!

16:35.870 --> 16:37.163
I was lonely.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.123
Your father had a lot

16:39.165 --> 16:40.500
of business trips.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.127
Now we know

16:40.541 --> 16:43.127
what his business was.

The only interesting thing

16:53.095 --> 16:55.097
about him was

he could walk up a flight

16:55.139 --> 16:57.725
of stairs on his hands.

What about Susan?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.510
It turns out we're not even

20:19.552 --> 20:21.095
related to them. Now come on.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.956
(microphone feedback)

20:49.916 --> 20:51.458
Look, you're going

20:49.916 --> 20:51.458
to hear a lot of stories,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.377
none of which are true,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.377
about some weird stuff

20:53.419 --> 20:54.587
happening in the woods.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.005
There could be some

20:54.628 --> 20:56.005
grainy photos,

20:56.047 --> 20:58.132
but my point is,

20:56.047 --> 20:58.132
we should get over the border

20:58.174 --> 20:59.133
as quickly as possible.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.509
Let's go!

21:02.261 --> 21:03.303
Dewey, please.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.932
Can't go on much longer!

21:08.226 --> 21:10.686
Oh. Ha!

21:10.728 --> 21:13.106
(laughing):

21:10.728 --> 21:13.106
I did it!

21:13.147 --> 21:14.356
I did it!

21:14.398 --> 21:18.945
I did it! I did it! I did it!
