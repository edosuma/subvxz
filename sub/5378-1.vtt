01:27.955 --> 01:29.890
Rookery:
VAMPIRES!

01:29.990 --> 01:31.159

01:32.426 --> 01:33.694
HYAH!

01:35.829 --> 01:38.432

01:38.532 --> 01:41.169
Rookery:

01:48.008 --> 01:49.743
YAAH!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.486
Vampire:

OH-HH...

02:53.407 --> 02:55.243
YOU HAVE
ANOTHER NIGHTMARE?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.844
THE VAMPIRES WERE BACK.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.846
OH, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.850
I'VE GOT TO GET
SOME SLEEP.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.257
MOM...

03:09.357 --> 03:12.025
DO YOU LIKE
THIS PLACE?

03:12.125 --> 03:15.195
WELL, IT'S A BIG CHANGE
FOR YOU, I KNOW.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.731
NEW HOUSE...

03:17.831 --> 03:19.567
NEW COUNTRY...

03:19.667 --> 03:21.269
( wind howling )

03:21.369 --> 03:22.536
HEAR THAT?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.938
IT'S THE WIND.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.874
OR THE UNDEAD.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.283
MOM?

03:35.383 --> 03:36.650
DAD?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.352
TONY,

03:38.452 --> 03:39.920
IF I DON'T GET
SOME SLEEP,

03:40.020 --> 03:42.222
THEN I'LL BE ONE
OF THE UNDEAD.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.759
Mom:
COME ON, HONEY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.529
GOT EVERYTHING?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.030
JUMP IN.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.565
PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.772
HEY...

03:58.872 --> 04:00.908
WAVE HI TO DAD
AND LORD McASHTON.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.055
SCOTLAND IS BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

04:16.156 --> 04:19.125
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE VAMPIRES.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.060
AND YOU KNOW
WE REALLY DON'T,

04:21.161 --> 04:23.731
RIGHT? BUT A DREAM
ISN'T REAL.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.566
I KNOW WHAT
A DREAM IS, MOM.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.900
OKAY.
I'M JUST ASKING.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.602
BUT YOU KNOW

04:28.702 --> 04:30.571
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS VAMPIRES, RIGHT?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.606
MOM!
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE ROAD!

04:32.706 --> 04:34.041
WHOA!

04:34.141 --> 04:36.477
( yelling )

04:37.578 --> 04:39.413
WHAT DID HE SAY?

04:39.513 --> 04:42.149
EVERYBODY
TALKS WEIRD HERE.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.017
DON'T WORRY, THINGS
ARE GONNA GET BETTER.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.587
YOU'LL MEET SOME
NEW FRIENDS HERE SOON.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.756
( chanting )
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

04:48.856 --> 04:50.324
THIS IS FOR BEING
A LITTLE CREEP!

04:50.424 --> 04:51.525
FIGHT! FIGHT!
FIGHT! FIGHT!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.494
FIGHT! FIGHT!
FIGHT! FIGHT!

04:53.594 --> 04:54.928
FIGHT! FIGHT!

04:55.028 --> 04:56.263
( bell ringing )

04:56.364 --> 04:57.865
AND THIS IS
FOR COMING HERE

04:57.965 --> 04:59.967
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.373
Teacher:
ON SATURDAY NIGHT,

05:05.473 --> 05:06.940
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE

05:07.040 --> 05:08.809
COMET FORSEY

05:08.909 --> 05:10.611
IN CONJUNCTION

05:10.711 --> 05:12.880
WITH THE MOON

05:12.980 --> 05:15.383
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 300 YEARS.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.950
AND THEN--

05:17.050 --> 05:19.720
AND THEN THE BEAM OF LIGHT
COMES FROM THE MOON.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.021
( children tittering )

05:21.121 --> 05:22.022
AS USUAL,
OUR AMERICAN FRIEND

05:22.122 --> 05:23.624
IS FULL OF STORIES.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.692
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.126
I DREAMT IT.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.561
STUPID YANK.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.729
FINE.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.830
NOW YOU'VE HAD
YOUR JOKE.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.499
NO.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.534
I'VE DREAMT IT EVERY NIGHT
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.903
AND THEN
THERE'S A GATHERING.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.104
A GATHERING OF WHAT?

05:37.204 --> 05:39.072
A GATHERING OF VAMPIRES.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.874
NOT AGAIN, TONY.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.643
I REALLY SAW IT!

05:42.743 --> 05:45.546
THE COMET,
THE BEAM OF LIGHT,

05:45.646 --> 05:47.948
THE VAMPIRES,
AND THE VAMPIRE HUNTER.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.082
( laughter )

05:49.182 --> 05:50.718
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S IT.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.987
YOU'VE EARNED YOURSELF
A CHAIR IN THE HALL.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.757
Boy:
FLY AWAY BACK
TO CALIFORNIA, CREEP.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.445
Dad:
LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.846
A GOLF CLUB!

06:18.946 --> 06:20.047
YEAH.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.850
A JUNIOR SET
OF GOLF CLUBS.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.051
YOU KNOW, THE GAME
WAS INVENTED

06:24.151 --> 06:25.453
IN SCOTLAND.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.521
BUT THERE'S NO ONE
TO PLAY WITH.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.690
WELL, THAT'S
THE BEAUTY OF GOLF.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.091
YOU DON'T NEED
ANYONE TO PLAY WITH.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.860
BUT I WANT SOMEONE
TO PLAY WITH.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.528
THEN I'LL TEACH YOU.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.630
YOU NEVER HAVE TIME.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.131
NOW, LOOK, TONY,
I'M TRYING HERE.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.133
THERE YOU ARE.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.704
THE BABYSITTER'S
DOWNSTAIRS.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.872
GOOD.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.006
WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA BE BACK?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.741
NOT TOO LATE, HON.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.810
IT'S BUSINESS.
LORD McASHTON
INVITED US.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.244
ALL THE INVESTORS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.547
HEY, LOOK AT THOSE.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.915
THOSE ARE GREAT!

06:55.015 --> 06:56.817
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DRAW SO GOOD.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.655
RIGHT.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.256
GREAT.
YOU KNOW...

07:03.356 --> 07:04.758
IF YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING REALLY COOL,

07:04.858 --> 07:07.060
DRAW ME A PICTURE
OF TIGER WOODS.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.567
GOOD NIGHT, HON.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.569
I WANT YOU IN BED
BY 9:00,

07:15.669 --> 07:18.005
AND DON'T GIVE YOURSELF
ANY NIGHTMARES.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.107
MWAH!
I LOVE YOU.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.614
BE A GOOD BOY.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.782
( birds twittering )

07:30.784 --> 07:32.953
( man snoring )

08:15.328 --> 08:16.897
( ringing )

08:24.672 --> 08:26.874
( sputtering )

08:26.974 --> 08:30.043
( machinery whining,
humming )

08:38.919 --> 08:40.287
( beeping )

09:04.812 --> 09:07.047

09:09.416 --> 09:10.951
LORD McASHTON.

BOB.
AND DODIE.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.553
DOTTIE.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.788
OF COURSE IT IS.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.356
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR BLIMP?

09:16.456 --> 09:17.758
- OH, I LIKE THE BLIMP--

09:17.858 --> 09:19.559
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.828
HE LIKES MY BLIMP.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.482

09:42.582 --> 09:44.852
OKAY, PET,
IT'S TIME TO-- OH!

09:46.654 --> 09:47.554
( hissing )

09:47.655 --> 09:49.456
OH! TONY!

09:49.556 --> 09:51.625
WHAT A FRIGHT
YOU GAVE ME!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.560
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
SITTING THERE, PET.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.228
OCH, DEAR, YOU NEAR
STOPPED MY HEART,

09:55.328 --> 09:57.330
AND IT'S NEAR ENOUGH
STOPPING AS IT IS.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.566
THAT'S THE TRUTH OF IT, AND
YOU WOULDNAE WANT TO DO THAT

09:59.667 --> 10:01.268
TO MISS LORNA NOW,
WOULD YOU?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.436
EH? LISTEN, YOU CAN HAVE
A WEE READ OF YOUR BOOK

10:03.536 --> 10:05.906
ONCE YOU'RE SETTLED,
BUT MEANWHILE BRUSH YOUR TEETH

10:06.006 --> 10:07.274
AND AWAY TO BED.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.779
BED FOR THE UNDEAD?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.346
( hissing )

10:18.251 --> 10:20.287
( beeping )

10:27.260 --> 10:29.730
AHH... HA HA HA!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.005
GOT YOU NOW,
YOU FILTHY THING!

10:38.105 --> 10:40.440
LET THE CHASE BEGIN.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.043
( starts engine )

10:50.450 --> 10:52.385
RIGHT.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.759
( frightened squeaking )

11:34.762 --> 11:37.697
Tony:
AB OVO...

11:38.966 --> 11:41.902
IN TOTO...

11:42.002 --> 11:43.370
( Tony growling )

12:08.028 --> 12:09.997

12:15.836 --> 12:17.404
( panting )

12:38.291 --> 12:39.426
Boy:
WHAT CLAN...

12:39.526 --> 12:41.261
ARE YOU FROM,
BROTHER?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.998
HAVE THE LIGHTS GONE?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.001
WHO ARE YOU?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.576
YOU ARE NOT
A BROTHER.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.978
WELL, I'M NOT
A SISTER.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.647
YOU'RE HUMAN.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.782
YOU'RE FULL
OF BLOOD!

13:02.883 --> 13:04.551
GONNA KEEP IT
THAT WAY, DUDE!

13:13.260 --> 13:15.062
( crash )

13:21.034 --> 13:22.936
I'M TOO WEAK...

13:23.036 --> 13:24.771
Tony whispering:
I'M NOT AFRAID...

13:24.872 --> 13:26.773
I'M NOT AFRAID...

13:26.874 --> 13:28.075
DO YOU NEED HELP?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.317
WHAT TWISTED KIND
OF MORTAL ARE YOU?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.186
I KNOW YOU.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.021
I SAW YOU
IN MY DREAM.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.423
MUST'VE BEEN
A NIGHTMARE.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.058
IT WAS.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.394
I MUST LEAVE.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.362
BUT YOU CAN'T
EVEN WALK.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.098
WHO NEEDS TO WALK...

13:52.099 --> 13:54.101
WHEN I CAN FLY?

13:56.469 --> 13:57.871
WHOA... AAH!

13:57.971 --> 13:59.072
( crash )

14:10.017 --> 14:12.085
( TV on )

14:28.701 --> 14:30.603

14:34.741 --> 14:36.009
ROOKERY.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.586

14:46.686 --> 14:48.121
DO YOU KNOW

14:48.221 --> 14:50.157
WHERE I CAN GET
A COW?

14:51.959 --> 14:52.960
IF YOU WANT
A GLASS OF MILK...

14:53.060 --> 14:55.162
NO, NOT MILK.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.464
A COW.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.399
HURRY.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.914
( lowing softly )

15:18.551 --> 15:21.188
YOUR EYES
ARE GETTING HEAVY...

15:23.223 --> 15:25.592
YOU'RE FALLING
INTO A DEEP SLEEP...

15:32.065 --> 15:34.534
( slurping )

15:34.634 --> 15:36.636
UGH...

15:36.736 --> 15:38.438
I THINK
I'M GONNA HURL.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.613
( slow beeping )

15:58.425 --> 16:00.593
AWW...

16:00.693 --> 16:04.164
IT'S JUST A LITTLE ONE.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.466
WELL, LET'S SEE
HOW YOU LIKE

16:06.566 --> 16:08.168
THIS!

16:13.873 --> 16:15.308
SO...

16:15.408 --> 16:17.044
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR YOU, EH?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.245
( starts engine )

16:32.725 --> 16:34.627
LET'S SEE YOU ESCAPE

16:34.727 --> 16:36.096
FROM ME NOW!

16:37.264 --> 16:38.165
AAH!

16:38.265 --> 16:39.666
SHUT YOUR EYES, TONY!

16:41.701 --> 16:43.403
( winding down )

16:43.503 --> 16:44.671
THAT WAS VERY CLEVER.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.773
BUT I'LL

16:46.873 --> 16:48.408
CATCH YOU!

16:50.743 --> 16:52.479
YOU CAN OPEN

17:03.823 --> 17:06.393

GONNA SPLATTER ME.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.361

CALLING ME DUDE.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.098
MY NAME'S RUDOLPH.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.099
DUDE IS SLANG.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.103
LIKE YOU CALL A FRIEND.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.537
A FRIEND?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.406

17:40.627 --> 17:42.195
YEAH!

17:42.295 --> 17:44.397
( playing classical music )

17:44.497 --> 17:46.233
Bob:
I HAVEN'T HEARD
MUSIC LIKE THIS

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
SINCE MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.402
( humming )

17:51.371 --> 17:53.373
YOU SEE, IT HAS
A PROPER RHYTHM.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.142
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.244
AH, THE GRANDSONS!

17:57.344 --> 17:59.312
WE CAME TO SAY
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDFATHER.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.547
NOW, BOYS...

18:00.647 --> 18:02.449
THIS IS TOMMY'S MOTHER
AND FATHER.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.417
THAT'S TONY.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.485
TONY.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.086
OF COURSE IT IS.
THE BOYS TELL ME

18:07.187 --> 18:09.088
THAT THEY HAVE BECOME
GREAT FRIENDS WITH YOUR SON.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.890
HE'S OUR FAVORITE
PLAYTHING.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.225
Boy #2:
PLAYMATE.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.227
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.462
OFF TO BED.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.963
WELL, LOVELY
TO MEET YOU.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.498
TELL TONY WE'LL
SEE HIM TOMORROW.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.666
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.833
Dad:
HA! WILL DO.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.502
THEY SEEM LIKE
TERRIFIC KIDS.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.003
THEY ARE, THEY ARE.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.905
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I NEED ANOTHER DRINK...

18:26.005 --> 18:27.507
OF POISON.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.777
CHEERS.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.746
CHEERS.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.882
( bagpipe plays )

18:37.717 --> 18:38.818
SO...

18:38.918 --> 18:41.454
HOW IS MY SON
FITTING IN? OKAY?

18:41.554 --> 18:42.522
HE DOESN'T TELL YOU?

18:42.622 --> 18:43.823
OH, HE TELLS ME PLENTY,

18:43.923 --> 18:45.425
BUT, YOU KNOW KIDS.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.195
I'M TALKING ABOUT
TONY'S OBSESSION

18:48.295 --> 18:49.662
WITH VAMPIRES.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.637
EXCUSE ME.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.375
Tony:
I THINK I SHOULD
GET HOME.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.911
RUDOLPH, HOW DO WE
GET DOWN FROM HERE?

19:05.011 --> 19:07.380
WE'LL FLY.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.183
BUT I CAN'T FLY.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.818
I GOT YOU UP HERE,
DIDN'T I?

19:13.019 --> 19:14.120
WELL, I GUESS SO.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.655
THEN STAY CALM...

19:15.755 --> 19:17.624
FRIEND.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.828
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S FLY.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.032
AS LONG AS I'M
HOLDING ONTO YOU,

19:26.233 --> 19:27.700
YOU'RE FINE.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.336
TRUST ME.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.803
READY?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.239
WHOA, I'M FLYING!

19:34.241 --> 19:36.309
WOW-WW...!

19:41.581 --> 19:44.251
WOW! IT'S GREAT
TO BE A VAMPIRE!

19:44.351 --> 19:46.419
MEMBERSHIP DOES HAVE
ITS PRIVILEGES.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.155
LOOK.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.424
MY MOM AND DAD WENT
TO A PARTY THERE.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.897
( cell phone rings )

19:57.997 --> 20:01.934
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.337
( wailing )
OH, MR. THOMPSON,
AWFUL SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

20:04.437 --> 20:05.972
BUT I DIDNAE KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO!

20:06.072 --> 20:07.540
WHAT?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.742
HE'S NOT HERE AND
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE

20:09.842 --> 20:11.278
AND... NO,

20:11.378 --> 20:12.845
NO, I CAME UP
AND HE WAS--

20:12.945 --> 20:14.247
UNTIL UP ABOUT
HALF AN HOUR AGO.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.416
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
SAY IT AGAIN.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.351
IN ENGLISH.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.752
SLOWLY.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.588
COME BACK
WITH MRS. THOMPSON.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.822
HELP ME FIND HIM!

20:22.922 --> 20:24.491
YEAH!

20:28.861 --> 20:30.963
VAMPIRES ARE DIFFERENT
THAN I THOUGHT THEY'D BE.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.401
FATHER'S SEEN TO THAT.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.935
WE'RE A FAMILY,
NOT FIENDS.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.770
THAT'S WHY WE ONLY TRY
TO DRINK COW'S BLOOD.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.038
BUT I THOUGHT VAMPIRES

20:39.138 --> 20:40.873
DRINK HUMAN BLOOD.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.610
WE DO, BUT WE'VE GOT
TO MAKE DO WITH COWS.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.111
WHY?

20:45.211 --> 20:47.780
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN
HUNTED FOR CENTURIES.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.416
WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HIDE.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.251
WE WANT TO BECOME HUMANS,
NOT EAT THEM FOR DINNER.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.327
CAN YOU SEE WHAT COLOR
THAT CAR IS?

21:00.427 --> 21:01.260
GREEN.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.895
MAN AND WOMAN INSIDE,

21:02.995 --> 21:04.631
MAN TALKING
VERY LOUDLY

21:04.731 --> 21:05.832
AND WAVING HIS HANDS.

21:05.932 --> 21:06.899
OH, NO,
MY PARENTS!

21:06.999 --> 21:08.301
I'M IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.669
MY DAD'S
GONNA KILL ME!

21:16.409 --> 21:18.110
HE WASN'T LIKE THIS
AT HOME.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.947
THIS IS SCOTLAND,
NOT SAN DIEGO.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.916
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE'S AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.185
OH, MR. THOMPSON,
MRS. THOMPSON!

21:26.285 --> 21:27.920
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ON YOU COMING BACK!

21:28.020 --> 21:30.590
CANNAE UNDERSTAND.
SENT HIM AWAY EARLY,

21:30.690 --> 21:32.091
LIKE YOU SAID,
TO BED.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.025
AND THEN I WAS UP
CHECKING HIM AND--

21:33.125 --> 21:34.861
TONY?

21:34.961 --> 21:35.862
I MEAN, JUST
FOR HALF AN HOUR

21:35.962 --> 21:37.530
AND I CANNAE
UNDERST--

21:39.832 --> 21:40.933
I SAW
WHAT I SAW

21:41.033 --> 21:42.502
AND I SAW
WHAT I DIDNAE SEE.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.837
AND-- AND I--
I DIDNAE SEE--

21:44.937 --> 21:46.939
( sniffing )

21:47.039 --> 21:47.974
WHAT'S THAT?

21:48.941 --> 21:49.842
( sniffing )

21:49.942 --> 21:51.544
I SMELL IT, TOO.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.314
SO...

22:28.415 --> 22:30.082
THOSE ARE YOUR PARENTS?
THEY LOOK NICE.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.684
AND TASTY?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.753
NO, NICE.
AS IN VERY NICE.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.756
THEY HAVE THEIR MOMENTS.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.491
I SUPPOSE I MUST
TAKE MY LEAVE.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.997
I HAVEN'T HAD SO MUCH FUN
WITH A BOY MY OWN AGE

22:45.097 --> 22:46.766
SINCE I REALLY
WAS NINE.

22:46.866 --> 22:47.900
THANKS...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.035
DUDE.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.605
YOU CAN STAY
IF YOU WANT.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.844
MAYBE I SHOULD.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.012
DO VAMPIRES ALWAYS
SLEEP IN COFFINS?

23:00.112 --> 23:01.648
'CAUSE THAT'S
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.716
JUST AS LONG AS THE SUN
CAN'T FIND ME.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.452
THIS WOULD BE EXCELLENT.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.690
I HAVE TO TAKE OUT
ALL THIS JUNK.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.059
JUNK? IT'S
A TREASURE CHEST.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.728
I'VE HIDDEN IN TREES

23:15.828 --> 23:17.630
AND WATCHED MORTALS
PLAY THIS GAME.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.632
- WHAT IS IT?
- NINTENDO.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.133
DUH-HH!

23:21.233 --> 23:22.535
NINTENDO DUH...

23:22.635 --> 23:24.704
CAN I PLAY WITH
THIS NINTENDO DUH?

23:24.804 --> 23:25.872
IT'S NINTENDO.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.440
DUH'S JUST A WORD
PEOPLE SAY

23:27.540 --> 23:29.876
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS
A DUMB QUESTION.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.412
DUH...

23:33.513 --> 23:35.147
MORE LIKE DUH-HH!

23:35.247 --> 23:36.549
DUH-HH!

23:38.284 --> 23:39.886
DUH-HH!

23:39.986 --> 23:41.387
DUH.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.823
I'LL TEACH YOU
NINTENDO TOMORROW.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.827
I KNOW.
YOU MUST SLEEP NOW.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.762
IT'S LATE
FOR MORTALS.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.973
UNTIL THE NIGHT.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.175
GOOD NIGHT.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.531
SO YOU'RE LIKE
1,000 YEARS OLD

24:24.631 --> 24:26.999
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.769
Rudolph:
I'VE JUST BEEN NINE
FOR OVER 300 YEARS.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.938
I WANNA BE
A VAMPIRE, TOO.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.040
NO.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.008
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.145
NAH, DOING
THE MOST AWESOME STUFF

24:39.245 --> 24:42.715
I'VE EVER DONE
IN MY LIFE.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.450
NO BLUE SKIES,
TONY.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.152
NO BIRDS SINGING.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.220
NO FLOWERS
IN THE SUNLIGHT.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.691
JUST THIS
CONSTANT NIGHT.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.492
COOL!

24:55.762 --> 24:57.797
( birds twittering )

24:57.897 --> 24:59.766
GOOD MORNING!

25:01.934 --> 25:04.370
NOW, WHY ARE YOU
SLEEPING THIS WAY?

25:04.470 --> 25:06.706
DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER
NIGHTMARE LAST NIGHT?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.007
YEAH.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.709
AWW...
POOR BABY.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.179
NO.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.281
I DREAMT
I WAS... FLYING.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.182
YOU DID?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.817
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

25:17.917 --> 25:19.552
THAT'S A GOOD KIND
OF DREAM TO HAVE.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.387
NOW, COME ON, GET UP.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.723
RISE AND SHINE!
TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL!

25:37.870 --> 25:39.105
HISS-SS!
THE SUN!

25:39.205 --> 25:41.073
SORRY, DUDE.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.675
Dottie:
HONEY, YOU HUNGRY?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.777
I COULD EAT A COW!

25:57.957 --> 25:59.058
( hisses )

25:59.158 --> 26:01.227
NANCY...

26:12.705 --> 26:14.373
GOOD MORNING,
VAMPY.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.076
YOU MEAN WIMPY,
DON'T YOU? HA!

26:17.176 --> 26:19.679
OUT OF MY WAY,
LOSERS!

26:21.981 --> 26:22.849
YOU DIRTY LITTLE--

26:26.719 --> 26:27.920
( chanting )
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

26:28.020 --> 26:29.922
FIGHT! FIGHT!
FIGHT! FIGHT!

26:32.058 --> 26:33.192
Dottie:
FIGHTING WITH
THE McASHTON BOYS,

26:33.292 --> 26:34.293
OF ALL PEOPLE!

26:34.393 --> 26:35.762
THEY STARTED IT.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.664
KEEP STILL.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.565
IT'S STILL BLEEDING.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.167
LET ME GET
ANOTHER TISSUE.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.169
NOW, LAST NIGHT
YOUR TEACHER TOLD ME

26:43.269 --> 26:45.471
THAT YOU'D BEEN TALKING
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT MONSTERS.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.774
NO WONDER THEY
KEEP TEASING YOU.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.676
NOT MONSTERS.
VAMPIRES.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.010
IT'S ALL THE SAME.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.378
NO, IT'S NOT.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.581
YOU KNOW,
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH

26:55.682 --> 26:57.249
MAKING FRIENDS
LIKE THAT.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.685
I HAVE A FRIEND.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.619
YOU DO?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.488
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

27:02.689 --> 27:04.023
RUDOLPH.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.992
WHERE DOES HE LIVE?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.426
NOT FAR.

27:07.526 --> 27:08.695
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

27:08.795 --> 27:11.397
HE'S...

27:11.497 --> 27:12.965
HE'S VERY,
VERY COOL.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.366
WELL, INVITE HIM
FOR A SLEEPOVER.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.769
I ALREADY DID.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.638
( sniffs )

27:19.739 --> 27:21.674
( sniffing )

27:21.774 --> 27:22.975
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.877
WHAT?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.846
THAT SMELL.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.481
( sniffs )

27:29.581 --> 27:31.183
I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.162
Dad:
NICE, EASY STROKE.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.899
OKAY, GIVE IT A SHOT.

27:52.772 --> 27:55.374
ALL RIGHT!
PRETTY GOOD!

27:55.474 --> 27:56.809
WHEN DOES THE SUN
GO DOWN?

27:56.909 --> 27:59.245
NOT FOR A WHILE.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.948
BUT I NEED TO BE HOME
BEFORE IT SETS.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.584
WHAT'S THE BIG HURRY?
YOU BORED ALREADY?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.153
NO.
I KNOW

28:07.253 --> 28:09.321
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT ME.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.660
TONY, I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
SO ROUGH ON YOU LATELY,

28:14.761 --> 28:16.729
I GOT THE JOB ON ONE HAND
AND THIS TEACHER--

28:16.829 --> 28:18.865
I KNOW.
MOM TOLD ME.

28:18.965 --> 28:19.832
YEAH.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.235
DAD, DO YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.872
OH, NO, TONY.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.706
I JUST THINK
THAT VAMPIRES

28:27.807 --> 28:29.275
BELONG IN A MOVIE
SOMEWHERE,

28:29.375 --> 28:30.777
NOT IN YOUR ROOM.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.311
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE'S IN MY ROOM?

28:33.312 --> 28:34.914
I'M KIDDING.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.484
NOT VERY FUNNY,
RIGHT?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.487
KIND OF FUNNY.

28:41.587 --> 28:42.855
LET'S PLAY GOLF!

28:42.955 --> 28:43.790
OKAY,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

28:43.890 --> 28:45.191
LET'S SET UP AGAIN.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.273
RUDOLPH!

29:28.868 --> 29:31.003
( fluttering )

29:33.873 --> 29:35.174
( footfall )

29:36.608 --> 29:37.543
PSST!

29:37.643 --> 29:39.011
WHAT?

29:42.248 --> 29:43.916
RUDOLPH!

29:47.686 --> 29:49.321
CAN WE GO FLYING AGAIN?

29:49.421 --> 29:51.457
NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.758
I ONLY CAME
BECAUSE OF THIS.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.760
HMPF! MY DRAWING?
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.794
WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.363
WHY DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.265
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.002
I'LL ONLY TELL YOU IF
YOU TAKE ME FLYING AGAIN.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.941
YIPPEE!

30:11.911 --> 30:14.013
WHOA-AA...

30:19.618 --> 30:20.786
Rudolph:
WE LIVE DOWN THERE.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.856
CEMETERY?
COOL!

30:23.956 --> 30:25.858
Tony:
I COULD GET
USED TO THAT.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.494
SO YOU DIDN'T SEE
THE REAL THING, THEN?

30:29.695 --> 30:31.363
I DREAMT IT ALL.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.065
THE AMULET...

30:33.165 --> 30:34.833
THE COMET...

30:34.934 --> 30:36.835
DOES IT MEAN
SOMETHING?

30:36.936 --> 30:39.171
I CAN'T SAY.
IT'S A SECRET.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.708
WHO AM I GONNA TELL?

30:42.808 --> 30:44.476
WHO'S GONNA
BELIEVE ME?

30:46.645 --> 30:47.914
ALL RIGHT.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.549
IT IS
THE COMET ATTAMON.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.885
IT'S THE COMET
OF THE LOST SOULS.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.553
IT COULD MEAN
THE END OF THIS CURSE.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.156
WHAT CURSE?

30:57.256 --> 30:59.158
THE CURSE
OF BEING A VAMPIRE.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.894
IT IS A PIECE OF THE COMET
THAT FELL TO EARTH.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.531
A GREAT MAGICIAN MADE IT
INTO AN AMULET OF POWER,

31:05.631 --> 31:08.901
AND WE LOST IT,
300 YEARS AGO TO THE SEA.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.270
YES, YES,
I SAW IT!

31:11.370 --> 31:13.272
MY UNCLE VON
TRIED TO CATCH IT...

31:15.474 --> 31:17.243
AND WE'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM SINCE.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.911
FROM THAT NIGHT
TO THIS,

31:19.011 --> 31:21.280
OUR WANDERING
HAS NEVER ENDED.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.082
I'LL HELP YOU
FIND IT.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.851
THAT MUST BE WHAT
MY DREAM REALLY MEANS.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.920
YES, YOU'RE
TO JOIN OUR QUEST.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.888
WE'LL TRULY BE
BROTHERS NOW.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.391
( bats squeaking )

31:37.663 --> 31:39.231
HIDE!
MY PARENTS ARE COMING!

31:39.331 --> 31:40.366
BUT WE'RE BROTHERS!

31:40.466 --> 31:42.101
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT!
GO!

31:53.145 --> 31:55.281
Rudolph:
MAMA! PAPA!

31:55.381 --> 31:58.951
RUDOLPH! THANK THE STARS
YOU'RE SAFE!

31:59.051 --> 32:00.919
MY SON, YOU MUSTN'T
STRAY SO FAR AWAY.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.321
WE WERE AFRAID--

32:02.421 --> 32:04.090
I WAS ONLY TAKING
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.224
YOU GOT LOST.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.259
MY POOR RUDOLPH!

32:07.359 --> 32:08.961
Girl:
YOO-HOO!

32:09.061 --> 32:12.131
- ANNA!
- BROTHER, DARLING.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.499
YOU'RE
THE NERVY ONE...

32:13.599 --> 32:15.434
SNEAKING OFF
LIKE SOME DAYWALKER.

32:15.534 --> 32:16.969
I WISH.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.504
SO, FATHER,
DID YOU FIND THE STONE?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.240
NO, BUT I'M SURE
WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.908
WE STILL HAVE
48 HOURS.

32:23.009 --> 32:23.909
WELL, YOU SEE,
THAT'S--

32:24.010 --> 32:26.012
I WILL NOT FAIL YOU!

32:26.112 --> 32:27.546
GREGORY!

32:27.646 --> 32:29.148
( snarling )

32:32.084 --> 32:33.619
NO, GREGORY!
HE'S MY FRIEND!

32:33.719 --> 32:35.187
A MORTAL!

32:37.056 --> 32:39.025
I'M RUDOLPH'S FRIEND,

32:39.125 --> 32:41.227
AND HE GAVE ME
A BITE-PROOF GUARANTEE.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.730
YOU COULD BE
ANYTHING TO MY SON.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.965
VICTIMIZER, SLAVE...

32:47.066 --> 32:48.367
DINNER, PERHAPS.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.302
BUT YOU CAN NEVER
BE HIS FRIEND.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.005
HE LIKES VAMPIRES,
AND HE DREAMS ABOUT US.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.441
AM I IN YOUR
DREAMS, MORTAL?

32:55.541 --> 32:57.209
AND HE KNOWS
ABOUT THE AMULET.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.045
AH...
THEN HE'S A SPY.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.479
ROOKERY'S KNAVE.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.049
DARLING, HE DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A SPY.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.551
AND BESIDES,
EVEN RUDOLPH

33:05.651 --> 33:08.020
COULDN'T MAKE UP
SUCH A STORY.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.023
COULD YOU,
SWEETHEART?

33:11.123 --> 33:14.626
MORTAL OR NOT,
HE'S JUST A BOY.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.528
BUT IF YOU INSIST
ON EATING HIM,
GO AHEAD--

33:16.628 --> 33:18.730
I NEVER SAID
I WOULD.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.033
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.235
- LEAVE, I SAY.
- BUT, RUDOLPH--

33:23.335 --> 33:24.470
SHOULD'VE NEVER
BEFRIENDED YOU.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.772
LEAVE, I SAY!

33:27.873 --> 33:30.409
AAH!

33:37.749 --> 33:39.218
ROOKERY!
GET BACK!

33:39.318 --> 33:40.986
GET BACK!

33:41.087 --> 33:43.122
GO!
TAKE THE FAMILY!

33:44.456 --> 33:45.391
RUN!

33:45.491 --> 33:48.827
DO AS I SAY!

33:48.927 --> 33:51.397
STAY AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY!

33:51.497 --> 33:53.099
DO YOUR WORST!

33:59.638 --> 34:02.308
THE AGE OF CHIVALRY
IS NOT YET DEAD--

34:08.514 --> 34:09.781
Rookery:
YOU!

34:24.196 --> 34:27.266
WHAT KIND OF
BLOODSUCKER ARE YOU?

34:35.607 --> 34:36.641
( crashing )

34:36.742 --> 34:38.277
OW!

34:42.414 --> 34:43.449
Rudolph:
TONY, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

34:46.152 --> 34:47.819
LOOK OUT!

34:49.355 --> 34:51.389
COME ON!

34:51.489 --> 34:52.491
AAH!

34:53.759 --> 34:54.726
OH!

34:54.826 --> 34:56.495
WOW.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.398
HEY!

34:59.498 --> 35:01.733
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.969
NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, PAL.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.405
IT IS WHEN IT'S
IN MY CEMETERY.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.675
VISITING HOURS ARE
FROM DAWN TILL DUSK.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.511
NOW... GET A MOVE ON!

35:18.284 --> 35:19.718
WHAT YOU DID
WAS FOOLISH!

35:19.818 --> 35:22.087
FOOLISH...

35:22.188 --> 35:23.522
BUT BRAVE.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.506
WE SHARED A VISION.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.908
HE HAS A SYMPATHY
FOR OUR KIND.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.544
OH, LOVELY.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.146
YOUNG VON
FOUND THE STONE...

36:21.247 --> 36:23.148
THEN MADE HIS WAY
TO SCOTLAND...

36:23.249 --> 36:25.016
PLUCKED FROM THE SEA
BY A MERCHANT SHIP

36:25.116 --> 36:26.685
JUST AS RUMOR HAD IT.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.720
THEN HE COULD STILL
BE ROAMING FREE.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.189
THERE WAS A WOMAN
I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE...

36:31.290 --> 36:32.891
SHE WORE A STRANGE
COAT OF ARMS.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.494
WE MUST FIND WHICH FAMILY
SHE BELONGS TO,

36:35.594 --> 36:36.795
TRACE HER CREST.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.230
I CAN HELP.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.432
NO... IT'S TOO RISKY
TO INVOLVE A MORTAL.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.100
WHAT HAVE WE
GOT TO LOSE?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.569
WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR THREE CENTURIES--

36:43.669 --> 36:45.271
THIS IS WHAT COMES
FROM CONTACT WITH MORTALS!

36:45.371 --> 36:47.439
DISRESPECT!
INSOLENCE!

36:47.539 --> 36:50.276
FREDERICK, HE DOES
HAVE A POINT.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.811
ALL RIGHT.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.948
HELP IF YOU CAN,
BUT DO NOT THINK

36:57.048 --> 36:58.684
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
AND BETRAY US

36:58.784 --> 37:01.587
TO OUR MOST HATEFUL ENEMY,
OR MY WRATH WILL BE REVEALED.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.555
AM I CLEAR?

37:09.961 --> 37:11.797
I THINK MY FATHER
LIKES YOU.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.299
THAT...

37:13.399 --> 37:14.733
WAS LIKING ME?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.768
I KNOW HE CAN SEEM
LIKE A REAL MONSTER

37:16.868 --> 37:18.437
BECAUSE HE'S SO STERN
WITH US.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.705
HE IS A MONSTER.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.139
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

37:21.239 --> 37:22.774
FOR US VAMPIRES
TO BE SO TORMENTED.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.743
OH, YEAH, I DO.
IT HAPPENS TO ME

37:24.843 --> 37:26.278
EVERY DAY AT SCHOOL.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.246
WHO DARES TORMENT
MY FRIEND?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.334
FLINT!

37:48.434 --> 37:49.401
FLINT!

37:49.501 --> 37:51.370
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!

37:58.877 --> 38:00.312
Tony:
I AM

38:00.412 --> 38:03.615
THE LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.017
I AM YOUR MASTER.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.057
IT'S TONY THOMPSON.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.392
GET HIM!

38:14.893 --> 38:16.828
I DON'T THINK SO.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.297
( screaming )

38:23.935 --> 38:27.172
I AM THE FIENDISH FRIEND
OF TONY THOMPSON.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.341
IF YOU DO NOT
TREAT HIM WITH RESPECT,

38:29.441 --> 38:31.477
YOU'LL FEEL MY WRATH!

38:31.577 --> 38:34.446
TELL ANYBODY WHAT YOU
HAVE JUST WITNESSED,

38:34.546 --> 38:36.915
AND YOU WILL BE BAT BAIT.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.316
( screaming )

38:42.421 --> 38:44.089
WHAT ON EARTH IS
GOING ON IN HERE?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.591
( wings flapping )

38:49.060 --> 38:50.929
Both:
NOTHING.

39:10.015 --> 39:10.949
CORA.

39:11.049 --> 39:11.983
( moo )

39:12.083 --> 39:12.984
NANCY.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.554
( moo )

39:34.172 --> 39:37.175
SLEEP WELL
LAST NIGHT, GIRLS?

39:37.275 --> 39:39.010
CARRY THESE.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.012
Both:
YES, MASTER.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.884
( bell ringing )

39:52.558 --> 39:55.861
IN THREE MONTHS' TIME,
THE WEATHER GODS PERMITTING,

39:55.961 --> 39:58.930
McASHTON'S WILL BECOME
SCOTLAND'S CALLING CARD

39:59.030 --> 40:01.032
TO NOT ONLY
THE GOLF WORLD,

40:01.132 --> 40:02.367
BUT...

40:02.468 --> 40:03.735
PLAYING GAMES...

40:03.835 --> 40:05.003
WHILE CORRUPTION
FESTERS

40:05.103 --> 40:07.305
BENEATH YOUR FEET?
TYPICAL.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.940
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
BUSTING IN HERE?

40:09.040 --> 40:11.009
MUCH AS I HATE
TO BE THE BEARER
OF BAD TIDINGS,

40:11.109 --> 40:12.911
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.013
YOU HAVE AN INFESTATION
OF VAMPIRES.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.886
DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO?

40:20.986 --> 40:22.921
I MIGHT ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.155
OBVIOUSLY A MADMAN.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.025
I'LL SHOW HIM
THE DOOR MYSELF.

40:29.227 --> 40:32.964
OBVIOUSLY,
A MADMAN.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.433
NOW WHAT'S ALL THIS
TALK ABOUT VAMPIRES?

40:35.534 --> 40:38.604
YOU DON'T SEEM TERRIBLY
SURPRISED, MY LORD.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.205
WELL, ONE
HAS HEARD RUMORS.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.573
LEGENDS.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.241
NONSENSE, OF COURSE.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.110
BUT WOULDN'T YOU LIKE IT
SORTED OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL

40:45.210 --> 40:46.912
BY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL?
IN FACT,

40:47.012 --> 40:48.980
BY THE ONLY
TRAINED PROFESSIONAL?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.949
NOW, I WILL ADMIT
THAT MY FEE

40:51.049 --> 40:52.818
IS SUBSTANTIAL.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.219
FEE?

40:54.319 --> 40:55.987
I HAVE TO PAY YOU
A FEE? FOR WHAT?

40:56.087 --> 40:57.623
FOR PUTTING AN END
TO YOUR WORRIES.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.290
AND FACE FACTS,
MY LORD,

40:59.390 --> 41:02.060
YOU DO HAVE WORRIES.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.265
HAS THERE BEEN
ANY BITING IN TOWN?

41:07.365 --> 41:09.801
NO.
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.136
WELL THEN,

41:11.236 --> 41:12.504
SHOW ME A BITING.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.005
THERE'LL BE
NO QUESTION OF FEES

41:14.105 --> 41:15.541
UNTIL I SEE PROOF.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.843
NOW... LEAVE.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.215
THEY THINK THIS IS STILL
SOME KIND OF PUBLIC SERVICE.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.488
Dottie:
AFTERNOON TEA... MM...

41:30.589 --> 41:32.958
VERY CIVILIZED, VERY...

41:38.930 --> 41:41.232
STAGS ARE DEERS
WITH HORNS, RIGHT?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.701
MALE DEERS.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.035
YEAH.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.470
LOTS OF SCOTTISH CRESTS
HAVE THOSE.

41:45.571 --> 41:47.005
- LOTS?
- YEAH.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.174
IT MEANS THEY DESCENDED
FROM HUNTERS.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.577
SO...

41:51.677 --> 41:52.744
TONY,

41:52.844 --> 41:54.546
WHY SO INTERESTED
IN CRESTS

41:54.646 --> 41:55.914
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.916
IT'S SORT OF...

41:58.016 --> 41:59.084
A NEW HOBBY.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.819
TONY?

42:00.919 --> 42:02.520
WHAT ARE YOU
REALLY UP TO?

42:02.621 --> 42:05.523
McASHTON HAS STAGS
ON HIS CREST, SEE?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.104
CAN I HAVE THIS?

42:19.204 --> 42:20.438
SURE.
GO AHEAD.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.207
AND, DAD,

42:22.307 --> 42:23.942
CAN I GO TO WORK
WITH YOU TOMORROW?

42:26.344 --> 42:27.913
UH, IT'S SATURDAY.
YEAH. WHY?

42:28.013 --> 42:30.916
TO CHECK OUT
YOUR PROJECT.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.084
GREAT.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.187
WILL LORD McASHTON
BE THERE?

42:36.287 --> 42:38.189
- HE LIVES THERE, BUDDY.
- BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU.

42:38.289 --> 42:39.625
I WON'T.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.628
TONY!

42:42.728 --> 42:43.962
WELL...

42:44.062 --> 42:45.631
BE PROUD HE FINALLY
HAS AN INTEREST

42:45.731 --> 42:47.032
IN SOMETHING NORMAL.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.734
ENOUGH WEIRDNESS
GOING ON AROUND HERE.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.769
NO WONDER HE'S
HAVING NIGHTMARES.

42:50.869 --> 42:52.137
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:52.237 --> 42:54.740
MY PRESENTATION
GOT INTERRUPTED TODAY

42:54.840 --> 42:55.907
BY A GUY
CLAIMING THE VILLAGE

42:56.007 --> 42:57.743
WAS INFESTED
BY VAMPIRES.

42:57.843 --> 42:59.778
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.179
WHAT GUY?

43:07.919 --> 43:09.788
Caretaker:
I'VE GOT NO FAMILY.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.256
NO ONE TO BE WITH.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.725
JUST ME AND
ALL THESE DEAD PEOPLE.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.360
Rookery:
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

43:15.460 --> 43:16.995
( pours drink )

43:17.095 --> 43:18.463
TO DEAD PEOPLE.

43:18.563 --> 43:21.199
AND... TO
THE LIVING DEAD.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.400
OH, COME ON.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.335
YOU'RE EITHER
ALIVE OR DEAD.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.738
THERE AIN'T NO
IN-BETWEEN, PAL.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.774
UNLESS YOU'RE
A VAMPIRE.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.241
VAMPIRES?

43:30.341 --> 43:31.910
HEH HEH!

43:32.010 --> 43:33.611
YOU MUST BE JOKING.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.280
I KNEW YOU'D LAUGH.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.447
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

43:36.547 --> 43:37.783
BUT WE'VE
BEEN HUNTING THEM

43:37.883 --> 43:39.217
FOR OVER 400 YEARS.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.086
THAT LONG?

43:41.186 --> 43:43.989
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS,
YOU MIGHT SAY.

43:44.089 --> 43:45.623
FOR A HUNTER,

43:45.724 --> 43:47.959
YOU WEAR AN AWFUL LOT
OF JEWELRY.

43:48.927 --> 43:50.028
THIS THING...

43:51.930 --> 43:53.464
THE VAMPIRES

43:53.564 --> 43:55.133
HAVE ONE JUST LIKE IT.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.635
BUT WITH ONE
SMALL DIFFERENCE.

43:57.736 --> 43:59.437
THEIRS IS DESIGNED
TO HELP THEM.

43:59.537 --> 44:00.806
THIS IS DESIGNED

44:00.906 --> 44:02.407
TO SEND THEM
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.843
ALL I NEED
IS THE STONE,

44:04.943 --> 44:06.277
AND THE MAGIC
IS COMPLETE.

44:06.377 --> 44:07.979
HEH HEH HEH!

44:08.079 --> 44:10.181
NOW IT'S--
IT'S MAGIC.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.320
THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER
WORLD OUT THERE...

44:15.420 --> 44:18.623
IF YOU JUST KNOW
HOW TO LOOK FOR IT.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.025
( wings flapping )

44:21.126 --> 44:22.794
WHAT'S THAT?

44:23.528 --> 44:24.863
THERE.

44:24.963 --> 44:25.864
WHAT IS IT?

44:25.964 --> 44:27.198
OHH...

44:27.298 --> 44:29.067
WE'RE IN LUCK.
COME ON!

44:33.972 --> 44:35.673
WHA-WHAT IS THIS?

44:35.774 --> 44:37.909
THIS WASN'T HERE
YESTERDAY.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.911
THIS? OH, YEAH.
I BUILT THIS.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.479
I'LL EXPLAIN IT
LATER.

44:41.579 --> 44:42.748
NOW...

44:42.848 --> 44:45.083
IT MUST'VE GONE
DOWN HERE.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.418
I'M GOING AFTER IT.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.854
WAIT!

44:48.954 --> 44:50.756
IT'S MY GRAVEYARD.

44:50.856 --> 44:51.890
IT'S MY JOB.

44:51.990 --> 44:52.891
I'LL DO IT.

44:52.991 --> 44:54.492
AHEM!

44:54.592 --> 44:56.227
WELL, UH...

44:56.327 --> 44:58.063
IF YOU INSIST.

44:58.163 --> 45:01.066
BUT TAKE
THIS SAFETY LINE.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.903
NOT THAT I'LL NEED IT!

45:07.305 --> 45:08.606
THERE YOU ARE.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.909
HEH HEH HEH!

45:11.009 --> 45:12.210
AND...

45:12.310 --> 45:14.179
DOWN WE GO.

45:14.279 --> 45:15.546
DOWN I GO...

45:15.646 --> 45:17.048
HEH HEH HEH!
YEAH.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.948
WHOA...

45:50.048 --> 45:52.217
COME ON...

45:52.317 --> 45:54.285
YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.

45:54.385 --> 45:56.154
( sniffing )

46:01.827 --> 46:02.828
( thud )

46:07.032 --> 46:08.299
( sniffing )

46:29.955 --> 46:31.990
( hissing )

46:32.090 --> 46:33.391
Caretaker:
AAH!

46:35.560 --> 46:37.228
OH, HA HA HA!
YEAH!

46:37.328 --> 46:39.264
OH, HO!

46:39.364 --> 46:40.431
THE LINE GROWS TAUT.

46:40.531 --> 46:42.834
HIS HEART POUNDS.

46:42.934 --> 46:44.870
HE KNOWS WHAT'S ON
THE OTHER END OF THE LINE,

46:44.970 --> 46:47.906
AND HE RELISHES THE FIGHT!

46:55.713 --> 46:58.183
HEY-- OOF!
LET ME DOWN!

47:00.118 --> 47:01.987
HERE WE COME.
YES!

47:02.087 --> 47:03.889
LET GO, GREGORY,
LET GO!

47:03.989 --> 47:05.023
IT'S A TRAP!

47:05.123 --> 47:07.358
GREGORY!
LET GO!

47:08.493 --> 47:10.028
OH, YEAH!

47:10.128 --> 47:11.496
MMM...

47:11.596 --> 47:13.164
HERE YOU COME,
HERE YOU COME...

47:17.135 --> 47:18.836
BINGO!

47:29.014 --> 47:31.049
YOU BIT HIM?

47:31.149 --> 47:33.084
JUST A TASTE.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.220
WAS IT WORTH
BETRAYING YOUR FAMILY?

47:36.787 --> 47:37.989
WELL, YOU'RE
THE TRAITOR,

47:38.089 --> 47:40.258
FOREVER DENYING
THE TRUTH OF US.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.327
WE ARE
THE DARK GODS,

47:42.427 --> 47:43.995
BUT YOU'VE TURNED US
INTO COWARDS,

47:44.095 --> 47:45.931
SKULKING AROUND
OUR HOLES LIKE WORMS!

47:46.031 --> 47:47.265
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE US DO?

47:47.365 --> 47:48.633
FIGHT BACK!

47:48.733 --> 47:50.235
MAKE THESE MORTALS'
BLOOD RUN COLD!

47:51.669 --> 47:53.004
AND YOU COULD DO IT,
GREGORY.

47:53.104 --> 47:55.340
YOU'RE YOUNG,
STRONG, RUTHLESS...

47:55.440 --> 47:57.042
AND WILLING TO RISK
A STAKE THROUGH THE HEART

47:57.142 --> 47:58.276
TO PROVE IT.

47:58.376 --> 48:00.145
BETTER A STAKE
THAN THIS PRISON!

48:14.325 --> 48:16.294
Frederick:
DO YOU THINK ME
OBLIVIOUS?

48:16.394 --> 48:20.731
Gregory:
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
TO YOU WHAT I THINK?

48:20.831 --> 48:24.302
IT MATTERS GREATLY.
I FEEL YOUR STING.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.704
BUT YOU ARE
FREDERICK THE GREAT.

48:26.804 --> 48:27.705
YOU FEEL NOTHING!

48:27.805 --> 48:30.575
LET THERE BE LIGHT!

48:31.509 --> 48:33.544
( screaming )

48:35.080 --> 48:36.214
RUN!

48:36.314 --> 48:38.716
WE'VE UNCOVERED
A WHOLE FLOCK!

48:38.816 --> 48:42.087
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR PUBLIC SPIRIT.

48:42.187 --> 48:43.921
( vampires screaming )

48:49.360 --> 48:50.328
AAH!

48:59.337 --> 49:00.805
Anna:
OH, MY HERO!

49:01.006 --> 49:02.440
WOW.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.209
WHO DID THAT?

49:11.682 --> 49:13.884
HEY!

49:13.985 --> 49:17.122
Tony:
I FOUND OUT ABOUT
THE COAT OF ARMS.

49:17.222 --> 49:19.857
IT'S LORD McASHTON'S,
MY FATHER'S BOSS.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.493
THE MISSING STONE
MUST BE AT HIS HOUSE.

49:25.796 --> 49:26.998
DID YOU HEAR ME, SIR?

49:27.098 --> 49:29.700
YOU BARELY
SAVED MY LIFE.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.036
HE'S VERY,
VERY WEAK.

49:31.136 --> 49:33.771
I KNOW JUST
WHAT YOU NEED.

49:33.871 --> 49:36.241
( slurping )

49:47.552 --> 49:49.020
Frederick:
NOW...

49:49.120 --> 49:51.822
I MUST FIND A PLACE
TO HIDE YOU CHILDREN

49:51.922 --> 49:53.558
YOU CAN STAY
AT MY HOUSE.

49:53.658 --> 49:56.961
WE NEED DARKNESS,
DAMPNESS, AND DECAY.

49:57.062 --> 49:59.097
THEN YOU NEED
OUR CELLAR.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.001
( snoring )

50:09.307 --> 50:11.676
( door creaking )

50:31.862 --> 50:33.231
I'M SORRY, IT'S--

50:33.331 --> 50:34.865
IT'S PERFECT!

50:34.965 --> 50:37.068
I NEED TO GO UPSTAIRS,

50:37.168 --> 50:39.637
BUT HAVE
A GOOD DAY'S SLEEP.

50:39.737 --> 50:42.807
AND DON'T WORRY,
I'M ON IT.

50:42.907 --> 50:44.909
ON... ON WHAT, DEAR?

50:45.009 --> 50:47.078
FINDING THE AMULET,
MOTHER.

50:47.178 --> 50:49.380
THAT'S HOW WE KIDS
TALK TODAY.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.182
OH.

50:51.282 --> 50:53.451
- BYE, DUDE.
- BYE, DUDE.

51:01.992 --> 51:04.429
( door creaking )

51:04.529 --> 51:05.796
( door closes )

51:05.896 --> 51:07.732
BOB.

51:07.832 --> 51:09.033
BOB, I HEAR
SOMETHING MOVING.

51:09.134 --> 51:11.602
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.871
TONY MIGHT BE
HAVING A NIGHTMARE.

51:13.971 --> 51:15.873
GO CHECK ON HIM,
POOR LITTLE GUY.

51:15.973 --> 51:16.874
IT'S NOT MY TURN.

51:16.974 --> 51:18.843
IT IS YOUR TURN.

51:18.943 --> 51:19.844
REALLY?

51:19.944 --> 51:21.179
REALLY.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.740
( door closes )

51:59.817 --> 52:02.320
( footsteps )

52:17.568 --> 52:19.136
( whispering )
Tony.

52:20.471 --> 52:21.906
HNN?

52:22.006 --> 52:23.641
OH.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.943
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY DAD AGAIN.

52:26.043 --> 52:28.112
DON'T BE SURPRISED.

52:28.213 --> 52:30.615
I ONLY WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

52:34.719 --> 52:36.554
IT'S FROM
THE OLD COUNTRY.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.789
IT WILL
BRING YOU LUCK.

52:38.889 --> 52:41.326
AND IF YOU
EVER NEED ME,

52:41.426 --> 52:42.993
JUST WHISTLE.

52:43.093 --> 52:44.929
YOU KNOW HOW
TO WHISTLE,

52:45.029 --> 52:46.697
DON'T YOU?

52:48.766 --> 52:51.636
( whistles eerily )

52:51.736 --> 52:53.704
( blowing )

52:56.040 --> 52:57.542
( whistling )

53:00.911 --> 53:02.680
( whistling echoes )

53:20.431 --> 53:22.199
( moo )

53:23.601 --> 53:26.203
SWEET MOTHER IN HEAVEN!

53:34.545 --> 53:36.614
GOOD MORNING! HEY...

53:36.714 --> 53:38.215
GOOD MORNING, MOM.

53:38.316 --> 53:39.517
WOW, TODAY'S THE DAY

53:39.617 --> 53:41.419
I GET TO GO TO WORK
WITH DAD!

53:41.519 --> 53:42.620
YEAH, I KNOW.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.854
WHY DON'T YOU
INVITE RUDOLPH?

53:43.954 --> 53:45.556
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

53:45.656 --> 53:46.857
AH, THE MYSTERIOUS
STRANGER.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.593
OH, HE'S AROUND.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.428
WELL, IT WOULD
BE NICE TO MEET HIM

53:50.528 --> 53:52.129
ONE OF THESE DAYS,

53:52.229 --> 53:53.598
MAYBE HAVE HIS PARENTS
OVER FOR DINNER.

53:53.698 --> 53:56.867
ACTUALLY, THEY'D RATHER
HAVE YOU FOR DINNER.

53:56.967 --> 53:58.703
EITHER WAY IS FINE.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.104
COME ON, HURRY UP.
LET'S GO.

54:00.305 --> 54:01.572
OKAY.

54:14.385 --> 54:16.387
Bob:
LORD McASHTON.

54:16.487 --> 54:17.288
AH!

54:17.388 --> 54:18.589
TAKE THESE, PLEASE.

54:18.689 --> 54:19.957
HEY, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY SON TONY.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.058
FINALLY.

54:21.158 --> 54:22.993
LITTLE
TONY THOMPSON.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.396
LET'S FEEL THAT FIRM
AMERICAN GRIP.

54:26.864 --> 54:30.635
SHAKE LORD McASHTON'S HAND.

54:30.735 --> 54:33.304
TONY'S VERY EXCITED TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY HISTORY.

54:33.404 --> 54:34.572
AREN'T YOU, TONY?

54:34.672 --> 54:36.474
UH... NOT
RIGHT NOW,
I'M NOT.

54:36.574 --> 54:38.809
WELL, IT'S
A NOBLE HISTORY INDEED.

54:38.909 --> 54:40.945
THE McASHTON'S HAVE RULED
IN THESE COUNTIES

54:41.045 --> 54:42.046
SINCE TIME...

54:42.146 --> 54:44.281
IMMEMORIAL.

54:47.885 --> 54:49.420
YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE ME.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.423
TONY...

54:52.523 --> 54:53.924
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM THAT GUY.

54:54.024 --> 54:55.826
HE'S CRAZY.

54:55.926 --> 54:56.961
( whispering )
I TOLD YOU

54:57.061 --> 54:58.062
NOT TO COME BACK!

54:58.162 --> 54:59.964
UNLESS--

55:00.064 --> 55:03.368
"UNLESS" IS EXACTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENED, MY LORD.

55:09.474 --> 55:10.541
AAH!

55:10.641 --> 55:12.643
NOT THE KIND OF HOLES
THAT ARE GOOD

55:12.743 --> 55:14.979
FOR THE GOLFING
BUSINESS, EH, MY LORD?

55:15.079 --> 55:17.948
A BITING RIGHT HERE
IN McASHTONLAND.

55:18.048 --> 55:19.283
AND THERE'LL BE MORE...

55:19.384 --> 55:21.652
UNLESS WE COME
TO SOME ARRANGEMENT.

55:26.391 --> 55:27.725
IT'S ELIZABETH...

55:27.825 --> 55:30.428
AND HER DEMON LOVER,
ISN'T IT?

55:31.396 --> 55:32.830
THEY'VE RETURNED.

55:32.930 --> 55:35.566
I TOLD YOU
YOU HAD WORRIES.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.867
OH, COME IN.

55:36.967 --> 55:38.803
Bob:
IF WE GOT UP HERE...

55:38.903 --> 55:40.405
ON 18...

55:40.505 --> 55:41.639
UH... YEAH.

55:41.739 --> 55:43.708
YEAH... IF WE CAN...

55:43.808 --> 55:46.644
CREST UP, OKAY,
BEFORE THE GREEN,

55:46.744 --> 55:48.779
I THINK WE CAN LOSE
THE SAND TRAPS FROM 18,

55:48.879 --> 55:50.581
AND THAT WAY...

56:06.431 --> 56:09.767
OUR ANCESTOR,
ELIZABETH McASHTON.

56:16.306 --> 56:19.376
THE STONE OF ATTAMON!

56:21.311 --> 56:23.113
McAshton:
MY GRANDFATHER
TOLD ME THE LEGEND.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.049
HE SAID IT WAS
TO DIE WITH ME.

56:25.149 --> 56:27.852
IT COULD STILL HAPPEN.

56:27.952 --> 56:30.220
SHE SAW A SHIP...

56:30.320 --> 56:32.222
FOUNDERED UPON THE ROCKS...

56:32.322 --> 56:35.760
THOUGH THERE
HAD BEEN NO STORM...

56:35.860 --> 56:38.729
NO SIGN OF LIFE.
NO CREW, SAVE ONE

56:38.829 --> 56:42.099
WHO CRAWLED ASHORE
INJURED.

56:42.199 --> 56:43.934
BUT HE WAS NO MORTAL MAN.

56:44.034 --> 56:46.471
HIS NAME WAS VON.

56:46.571 --> 56:48.873
VON SACKVILLE-BAGGE.

56:48.973 --> 56:50.541
A VAMPIRE.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.409
ELIZABETH WAS TAKEN
BY THIS VON

56:52.510 --> 56:54.945
AND BECAME ONE OF
THE UNDEAD HERSELF.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.081
AND THEN WHAT?

56:57.181 --> 57:00.250
OUR FAMILY STAKED HER.
AND VON.

57:00.350 --> 57:02.753
WARM-HEARTED BUNCH,
AREN'T YOU?

57:02.853 --> 57:04.922
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.323
I'M JOKING,
MY LORD.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.093
I WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME MYSELF.

57:09.193 --> 57:11.128
SO WHERE IS SHE BURIED?

57:11.228 --> 57:12.463
WHY?

57:12.563 --> 57:14.231
LIKE YOU SAID,

57:14.331 --> 57:16.567
WE WANT TO KNOW IF
SHE'S WALKING AROUND.

57:16.667 --> 57:18.736
IF I WAS A McASHTON,

57:18.836 --> 57:21.271
I WOULDN'T WANT HER
LOOKING FOR ME.

57:21.371 --> 57:24.942
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR STAKE, MY LORD?

57:26.243 --> 57:28.112
HA HA!

57:35.219 --> 57:38.155
( laughing )

57:38.255 --> 57:39.189
BOO!

57:39.289 --> 57:40.190
( screaming )

57:40.290 --> 57:42.727
( all screaming )

57:45.563 --> 57:48.833
YOU'RE BLOCKING THE LORD
OF THE UNDERWORLD!

57:48.933 --> 57:50.000
WE-- WE DON'T MEAN TO!

57:50.100 --> 57:53.303
( hissing )

57:53.403 --> 57:55.239
I WANT YOU TO CRAWL
BACK TO YOUR ROOM,

57:55.339 --> 57:57.207
GET UNDER THE BED,

57:57.307 --> 57:58.676
AND STAY THERE!

57:58.776 --> 58:01.546
Y-YES, LORD UNDERWORLD.

58:04.248 --> 58:06.150
I SAID, CRAWL!

58:18.295 --> 58:21.231
AHEM!
ALLOW ME, MY LORD.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.767
I'M AN EXPERT.

58:26.436 --> 58:27.972
ALL PART
OF THE SERVICE.

58:34.745 --> 58:36.981
( whirring and grinding )

58:55.800 --> 58:57.534
HERE.

59:10.114 --> 59:11.281
SHE WAS MOVED.

59:13.417 --> 59:14.619
BUT NO ONE'S
BEEN DOWN HERE

59:14.719 --> 59:16.153
SINCE MOTHER DIED.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.794
( coughs )

59:23.894 --> 59:27.364
I'M TALKING ABOUT
CENTURIES AGO, MY LORD.

59:27.464 --> 59:29.399
AND JUDGING
FROM WHAT I SEE...

59:29.499 --> 59:32.269
THE TOMB IS
JUST HERE FOR SHOW.

59:32.369 --> 59:35.205
SHE'S IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE
WRAPPED IN CHAINS

59:35.305 --> 59:37.708
WITH A WOODEN STAKE
THROUGH HER RIBS,

59:37.808 --> 59:39.076
THE COFFIN PURIFIED.

59:39.176 --> 59:40.444
WHY?

59:40.544 --> 59:42.146
WELL, DO YOU REALLY
WANT YOUR MOM

59:42.246 --> 59:43.748
TO BE BURIED
NEXT TO A VAMPIRE?

59:43.848 --> 59:45.449
NO! NO!
I LOVED MOTHER!

59:45.549 --> 59:47.284
SHE ALWAYS SMELLED
OF GARDENIAS.

59:47.384 --> 59:48.819
SHUT UP.

59:48.919 --> 59:51.388
THEN THEY BURIED HER
IN UNHALLOWED GROUND,

59:51.488 --> 59:53.658
PROBABLY OUTSIDE
THE CHURCHYARD WALLS.

59:53.758 --> 59:55.325
THAT'S ACRES WORTH
OF LAND!

59:55.425 --> 59:57.427
WHICH IS WHY
I COME EQUIPPED WITH

59:57.527 --> 59:59.463
STATE-OF-THE-ART
VAMPIRE LOCATORS

59:59.563 --> 01:00:02.266
THAT YOU'RE PAYING
SO DEARLY FOR, MY LORD.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:09.006
THE LITTLE
VAMPIRE SYMPATHIZER!

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.975
YAAAH!
AAH!

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:14.812
OHH... NOW...

01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:16.346
YOU'VE MADE YOUR BED,

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.414
NOW...

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.217
YOU CAN SLEEP IN IT!

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.519
Tony:
NO!

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.188
NOOO!

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.456
McAshton:
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:27.858
- LET ME OUT!
- IT'S MURDER!

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.360
HE'S JUST A BOY!
THOMPSON'S SON.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.495
HE'S ONE OF THEM.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:32.997
I'VE SEEN THEM
ALL TOGETHER

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:34.598
SLITHERING
IN THE NIGHT.

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:36.433
I MUST TELL
HIS PARENTS!

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:37.501
Tony pounding:
LET ME OUT!

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:39.403
NOW...

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.471
THERE ARE
PLENTY OF WAYS

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.407
TO GET YOUR THROAT
PUNCTURED, MY LORD.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:45.876
DON'T MAKE ME
BE THE ONE.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.679
LET ME OUT!
( straining )

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:51.215
ALL RIGHT, J-JUST
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.482
RIGHT.
THAT'S BETTER.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:56.286
NOW, GO AWAY...
AND REMEMBER...

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.927
( squeaking )

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.455
( whistling )

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.891
( whistle drifting in, echoing )

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.109
Rudolph:
WHAT?

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:55.045
( whispering )
TONY'S CALLING.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:56.480
HE COULD BE IN DANGER.

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.617
MAYBE HE'S FOUND
THE STONE.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.486
LET'S GO.

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:03.687
OH, THE DRAMA--

01:02:03.788 --> 01:02:05.322
SHH!

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.027
OH, DEAR!
THE SUN.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:12.129
DAYLIGHT OR NOT,
WE MUST GO.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.300
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.735
YOU STAY HERE.
SHH!

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:21.071
Rudolph:
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT,

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:22.406
LEFT, RIGHT...

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:26.243
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT,

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.344
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT...

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.581
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT,

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.649
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT...

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.418
TONY!

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.422
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:39.523
BY RUNNING OFF
LIKE THAT TODAY?

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.158
YOU HAD ME
WORRIED SICK.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:43.828
WELL,
THAT'S NOT GOOD--

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.132
WAIT, I SUPPOSE...

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.366
THIS IS RUDOLPH
UNDER HERE.

01:02:50.835 --> 01:02:52.002
OKAY.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.971
WELL, THIS ISN'T
YOUR FAULT, RUDOLPH.

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:56.306
BUT WHEN YOU GET HOME
TONIGHT, TONY THOMPSON,

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.108
WE'RE HAVING
A SERIOUS TALK.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.745
OKAY.

01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:04.581
WELL... GO ON
AND PLAY YOUR GAME...

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:05.582
LEFT, RIGHT...

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:06.984
WHATEVER IT IS.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:08.385
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT...

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:11.421
AND WHAT'S THAT
ALL ABOUT?

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.190
Bob:
TONY RAN OFF
FROM WORK TODAY

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.859
AND I GOT
REALLY WORRIED.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:16.793
BUT I WAS SO HAPPY
HE WAS PLAYING WITH A FRIEND

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.929
AND NOT OBSESSING
ABOUT VAMPIRES.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.932
AMEN, HUSBAND OF MINE.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.303
WHICH MEANS WE GET
THE AFTERNOON ALONE.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:28.939
MM. I LIKE
THIS RUDOLPH ALREADY.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.308
HIS PARENTS WANT
TO HAVE US FOR DINNER.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:33.878
( straining )

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.280
TONY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.248
YEAH.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.050
DUDE, YOU HEARD ME!

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.153
I HEARD YOU, MY HERO,
AND I WROTE YOU A POEM.

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:45.956
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:48.458
ROOKERY.
WE BETTER FIND
ELIZABETH'S TOMB

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.860
BEFORE HE DOES.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.829
IT'S ABOUT
THE POWER OF LOVE.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:54.064
WHO'S ELIZABETH?

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.532
THE LAST HOLDER
OF THE STONE.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.867
THE WOMAN
IN MY DREAMS.

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:59.503
"YOUR FACE SAW I
IN THE CEMETERY,

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.038
FILLED WITH FRIGHT...

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.206
RUDOLPH, LOOK!

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:04.008
FOR THE NIGHT WAS SCARY.

01:04:04.108 --> 01:04:07.044
STILL, YOU FACED THE FOE

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.045
UNDAUNTED.

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.246
IT WAS THERE...

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.647
IT WANTS TO
LEAD US SOMEWHERE.

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:13.217
IT WAS YOU I WANTED...

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.319
TO HOLD ME
WHEN THE WINDS ARE..."

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:16.553
( metal creaking )

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:18.555
Rudolph:
BEHIND THE PILLAR, LOOK!

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.224
HEY!

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.461
IT'S A DOOR.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.163
A SECRET PASSAGE!

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.933
Rudolph:
THIS COULD LEAD
TO ELIZABETH'S GRAVE.

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:32.102
I WISH WE HAD
A BETTER LIGHT.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:35.005
Anna:
WAIT, ROOKERY SEEMS
TO HAVE LEFT THIS BEHIND.

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:36.406
THANKS.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.637
( humming )

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:15.912
GONE.
ALL OF THEM.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:19.149
THEY COULD'VE GONE
TO THE CLIFFS.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.452
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.554
MORTALITY BECKONS.

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:29.493
GREGORY.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:32.262
HE'S STOLEN THE AMULET.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.131
HE WILL CRUSH
OUR HOPES.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.566
HIS FINAL MOCKERY.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.235
NO.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:39.803
HE'S A REBEL,
BUT...

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:43.240
BUT TREACHERY
IS BEYOND HIM.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.675
IF HE HAS TAKEN
THE AMULET...

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.478
IT'S TO MAKE THE CALL.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.049
THEN WE SHOULD GO
TO THE CLIFF TOO.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.654
I'M STILL VERY WEAK.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.356
I WOULD FALL
FROM THE SKY

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.490
IF I FLEW.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.859
WE'LL FIND A WAY.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.295
Dottie:
NOT LIKE HIM
TO STAY OUT THIS LATE.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:06.997
Bob:
WHAT'S "LIKE HIM"
THESE DAYS,

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.166
EVER SINCE HE MET
THAT RUDOLPH?

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.500
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED HIM?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.202
I NEVER REALLY
MET HIM.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.604
WELL, I MEAN, I DID, BUT
HE WAS WRAPPED IN FOIL.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:17.207
I KNOW, BUT WE'VE
NEVER EVEN SEEN HIM.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.942
WE'VE NEVER MET
HIS PARENTS.

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:19.843
PROBABLY FOREIGNERS.

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:21.278
FOREIGNERS?

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.213
WE ARE
THE FOREIGNERS.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.815
THAT'S IT.
I'M CALLING THE COPS.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:29.353
OR THE COPPERS,
WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM.

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.555
BOBBIES.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:34.358
( doorbell rings )

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.226
YES, HI, THIS
IS DOTTIE THOMPSON.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:37.994
I'M CALLING
ABOUT MY SON.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:42.332
YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND ME?

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:44.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:45.235
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.736
I'M FREDA
SACKVILLE-BAGGE.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:49.606
THAT'S...

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:50.840
WONDERFUL.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.409
RUDOLPH'S MOTHER.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.346
I'M SURE YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT TONY.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:58.348
TONY?

01:06:58.448 --> 01:06:59.883
YOUR SON.

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:03.087
WE KNOW WHO HE IS.
WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE--

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.488
TONY IS GOING
TO THE CLIFF

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:06.556
WITH RUDOLPH AND ANNA
TO WATCH THE COMET.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.425
ANNA?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.095
OUR DAUGHTER.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.497
DARE I SAY
YOUR CHARMING YOUNG MAN

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:16.366
HAS CAST
QUITE A SPELL ON HER.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.502
WELL, WE THINK
HE'S CHARMING.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:20.537
FREDERICK
SACKVILLE-BAGGE.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:22.772
AT YOUR SERVICE.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.377
HI.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.413
HOW ABOUT IT, BOB?

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:30.914
WANT TO SEE A COMET?

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:32.416
SURE.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.918
ARE...

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:37.087
WE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN COSTUME,

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.222
LIKE YOU GUYS?

01:07:38.322 --> 01:07:38.955
COSTUME?

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.424
UH...

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.259
SHAKESPEAREAN
ARISTOCRATIC THING

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:43.360
LIKE YOU GUYS?

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.561
I DON'T WEAR
THE COSTUME

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.130
OF AN ARISTOCRAT.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.665
I AM AN ARISTOCRAT.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.800
OKAY.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.102
WHATEVER.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:54.538
WE SHOULD HURRY.
IT'S URGENT.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:55.705
Dottie:
URGENT?

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.341
WELL, THE COMET
IS NEAR.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.443
OH.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:06.983
Tony:
WE MUST BE NEAR
THE CEMETERY.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.452
FOLLOW ME.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:11.321
TO THE ENDS OF
THE EARTH, MY DARLING.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.789
WHERE'S
YOUR CAR?

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.158
WE FLEW.

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:16.292
LET'S TAKE YOURS.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.497
( horn honking )

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:28.337
HOLD UP, THOMPSON!

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.174
I'VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU.

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:32.108
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:34.042
OH, WE DIDN'T LIKE IT
300 YEARS AGO,

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:36.145
BUT WE DID OUR DUTY.
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.346
DUTY.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.316
USE THE BLUNT END
OF THE AX.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.783
ONE... TWO... THREE.

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.319
IT'S OVER.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.754
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.122
YOU HAVE TO
DRIVE THIS STAKE

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.323
THROUGH TONY'S HEART.

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:48.792
OH, MY GOD!

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:51.295
NO WORRIES.
HE'S ALREADY DEAD.

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.430
HE'S A VAMPIRE, BOB.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.432
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR A FATHER TO HEAR,

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.501
BUT YOUR SON'S
A BLOODSUCKING FIEND.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.667
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.

01:08:58.768 --> 01:08:59.403
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:00.636
TAKE THEM.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:02.104
YOU'LL THANK ME
IN THE MORNING.

01:09:02.206 --> 01:09:04.073
I'VE HAD ENOUGH

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:07.310
OF ALL YOU PEOPLE
AND ALL YOUR VAMPIRE BS!

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:09.112
AND DON'T CALL TONY
A VAMPIRE

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.546
EVER AGAIN!

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:14.218
AND HOW DARE YOU
EMBARRASS ME AND MY WIFE

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:15.618
IN FRONT OF OUR GUESTS?

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:18.287
THESE ARE ARISTOCRATS!

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:22.826
ARISTOCRATS?

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:24.560
YES, MY LORD.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.162
AND TONY HAPPENS TO BE
MY SON'S BEST FRIEND.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:30.200
AND ROBERT IS RIGHT.
TONY IS NO VAMPIRE.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.368
NOW DROP THAT AX

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:33.470
AND TAKE YOUR LEAVE.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.872
YEAH, TAKE YOUR LEAVE,

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:38.808
OR YOU'LL BE BUILDING
YOUR OWN GOLF COURSE, BUDDY!

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.077
ALL RIGHT.

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.446
I'M LEAVING.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.381
YOU HEAR THAT,
DOTTIE?

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:46.550
OWW!

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.385
I TOLD HIM
TO TAKE HIS LEAVE.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:49.953
YOU WERE WONDERFUL!

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:52.555
BOB... THE COMET.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:55.692
MY LADY.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.568
THOSE AREN'T ARISTOCRATS.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:08.204
THOSE ARE VAMPIRES!

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.875
( starting car )

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.424
WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING.
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:29.326
WE CAN'T GO
ANY FURTHER.

01:10:30.294 --> 01:10:31.895
WHY NOT?

01:10:35.299 --> 01:10:36.433
THERE'S SOMETHING AHEAD.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.234
SOME KIND OF CURSE.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.738
YOU HAVE TO GO FIRST,
TONY DEAREST.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:58.221
I FOUND IT!

01:10:58.322 --> 01:11:00.023
GO SEE WHAT IT IS.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:03.527
BUT BE CAREFUL.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.468
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRITTEN ON HERE.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:15.339
"CAVEAT... VAMPTOR."

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:17.474
"LET THE VAMPIRE
BEWARE."

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:18.808
IT'S A CURSE.

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:22.011
STUPID CHAINS.
BREAK. BREAK!

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.913
COME ON!

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.482
WE NEED A MIRACLE.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:37.060
OH, NO.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.662
OH, YES!

01:12:00.384 --> 01:12:01.751
YEAH!
THE CURSE IS GONE!

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:02.719
YES!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.888
( straining )

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:05.922
WHOA!

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.833
Rudolph:
LET'S TRY AND OPEN IT.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.868
Anna:
ONE, TWO, THREE, PULL!

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:20.069
NOW!

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.046
IT'S ELIZABETH.

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:31.715
UNCLE VON.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:34.150
FATHER WAS RIGHT.
HE DID COME HERE.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:35.852
OH, HOW ROMANTIC!

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.422
THEIR LOVE,
PRESERVED FOREVER.

01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:43.460
THE STONE ISN'T HERE.

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:47.631
( breathing hard )

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:56.906
UP HERE!
UP HERE!

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:58.374
OHH...

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.777
( shouting )

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.660
...GETTING AWAY!
GET HER! GET HER!

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.763
HERE!

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:51.928
Tony:
THE STONE IS IN MY ROOM!

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:53.930
NO WONDER
I HAD THOSE DREAMS!

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:59.435
THANK YOU FOR
SHARING THAT WITH ME.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:00.804
HEH HEH HEH!

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:20.189
( amulet humming )

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:32.001
WHAT?

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:33.570
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:36.640
THE CALL.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.542
YOU GO TO THE CLIFFS.
WE'LL GET THE STONE.

01:14:38.642 --> 01:14:39.976
OKAY, LET'S GO.

01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:46.816
Frederick:
ROBERT, COULD YOU DRIVE
A LITTLE FASTER, PLEASE?

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:49.152
DARLING, DO YOU HEAR?

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:51.187
HEAR WHAT?

01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:53.289
THE CALL.

01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:55.859
IT'S GREGORY,
OUR ELDEST SON.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.027
HE'S CALLING THE CLAN.

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:03.600
YEAH.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:09.739
( moo )

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.482
MOTHER!
FATHER!

01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:21.184
WE FOUND
UNCLE VON'S GRAVE.

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:22.752
I MEAN, TONY FOUND IT,

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.353
AND HE SAW THE STONE
IN A VISION.

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.055
HE AND RUDOLPH
ARE AFTER IT NOW.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:27.724
MAY THEIR QUEST
BE FRUITFUL.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:30.994
THANK YOU, GREGORY.

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:40.637
( humming intensifies )

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.579
SOMETHING WEIRD
IS HAPPENING HERE.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:50.947
( flapping )

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:53.249
BOB!

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:55.084
OH, GOD!

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:59.188
AAH!
OH!

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.691
DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE FINE.

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:04.694
Bob:
OKAY, JUST STAY CALM.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.930
FREDA SAYS
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.865
HI.

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:09.766
UH...

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.134
MY NAME'S BOB...

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.937
AND THIS IS MY WIFE,
DOTTIE.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.238
( snarling )

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.240
GOOD NIGHT FOR
A GATHERING, HUH?

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.175
LEAVE THEM ALONE.
THEY'RE FRIENDS.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.044
WHAT?
SINCE WHEN?

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.917
WHERE IS IT?

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.753
SOMEWHERE
AROUND HERE!

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.220
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.857
HOW DO I KNOW?
I HAVE VISIONS, DUDE.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:36.660
NO NEED TO BITE
MY HEAD OFF.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.961
BITING IS YOUR JOB.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:40.964
MINE IS TO FIND
THE AMULET.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.365
WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.075
ROOKERY!

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:29.045
* I'M COMING...

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:51.467
( door rattling )

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:53.737
OH! AW, BOYS...

01:17:53.837 --> 01:17:55.271
YOU'VE LOCKED THE DOOR.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.950
I FOUND IT!

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.156
THE STONE OF ATTAMON.

01:18:21.965 --> 01:18:23.399
HAND IT OVER.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.835
IT BELONGS
TO MY FRIEND.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.837
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT BELONGS TO ME NOW.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:28.772
GIVE.

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:30.940
NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.176
OH? WELL, I CAN'T
BE BOTHERED.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.050
TONY!

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.853
DON'T GIVE HIM
THE STONE!

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:47.456
AAH!

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:52.095
LET ME GO!

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.132
GET IN THERE!

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:15.785
GET OUT
OF THE WAY!

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:17.253
( honking horn )

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.223
GET OUT
OF THE WAY!

01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:27.463
GIVE ME THAT STONE.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:29.265
NO!

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.935
I SAID GIVE ME
THAT STONE!

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:33.336
MY FRIENDS NEED IT.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:36.105
OH, BOO-HOO!

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:37.773
I NEED IT, LADDIE...

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:42.245
TO SEND THEM
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.056
( lows threateningly )

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:24.287
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:29.792
YOU WANT THIS?

01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:33.096
WELL, COME
AND GET IT.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.338
NGGGH...

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:44.707
YAAAH!

01:20:44.908 --> 01:20:46.910
AAH!

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.312
YEE-HAA!

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:55.118
( Wagner's "Ride
of the Valkyries" begins )

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:56.319
WHOA!

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:03.359
( chortling )

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:11.200
WHOA!

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.980
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
GIVE ME THAT.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:27.016
HA HA HA!

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:30.987
Rudolph:
TONY, THE LIGHTS!

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.556
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS!

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:38.127
HEY!

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.495
YOU LEAVE THAT ALONE!
STOP THAT!

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.231
SIT BACK!

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:43.899
Rudolph:
TONY!

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:50.039
HEY!

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:51.174
WHOO-HOO!

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:55.945
OH-OH-OH...

GOING...

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.392
GONE!

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.198
WE HAVE ONLY
A FEW MOMENTS MORE.

01:22:18.034 --> 01:22:20.236
AFTER ALL
OF OUR WANDERING...

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:21.604
ALL OF OUR WAITING...

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.106
I'VE LEFT OUR FATE
IN THE HANDS

01:22:23.206 --> 01:22:24.640
OF TWO SMALL BOYS.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.309
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.177
I WON'T EVEN ASK
YOUR FORGIVENESS.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.179
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.420
RUDOLPH.

01:22:39.722 --> 01:22:41.357
YOU'VE GOT IT.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:42.425
ALL RIGHT!

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:43.726
YEAH!

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.443
AAH!

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:03.179
YEAH!

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:05.314
TONY'S NEAR.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:06.382
WHERE?

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.483
Vampire:
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:09.052
THERE!

01:23:09.152 --> 01:23:11.320
IN THE SKY!

01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:14.890
READY...

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:16.559
HOVER!

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:19.062
( together )
OH, MY GOD!

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.376
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR THIS.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:34.743
Vampire:
HE HAS THE AMULET!

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.679
THE STONE!

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.549
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:41.550
Vampire:
WE MUST GET MOVING.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:42.851
Dottie:
TONY!

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:46.021
MOM!
DAD!

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:48.757
THE STONE OF ATTAMON
IS OURS!

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:58.501
( ringing )

01:23:59.468 --> 01:24:02.071
AB OVO...

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.707
IN TOTO...

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:07.710
NIL DESPERANDUM...

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:11.046
SINE DIE...

01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:39.742
HEY... THAT'S MY BLIMP!

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:46.615
GAAH!

01:24:58.227 --> 01:24:59.595
MOM! DAD!

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.430
AND YOU'LL GO
STRAIGHT TO HELL!

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:03.632
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:12.575
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:17.580
Rudolph:
CATCH IT, TONY!

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.520
AAAAAH!

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:27.523
( splash )

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.458
Frederick:

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.461
TONY! YOU KNOW
WHAT WE WANT!

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.529
WISH IT!

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:40.636
YOU HAVE TO
WISH IT... NOW!

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:20.969
WHAT'D YOU WISH FOR?

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.908
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:21.664
HEY...

01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:24.433
IT'S ME... TONY.

01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.781
( whistling )

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:44.653
( whistling echoes )

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:24.753
( mooing )

01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:25.854
