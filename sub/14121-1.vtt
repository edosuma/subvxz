00:47.248 --> 00:50.451
(suspenseful music)

01:06.234 --> 01:10.204
And the monkey ran off to
cause even more mischief.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.706
The end.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.741
Mm.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.775
Okay.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.445
[Megan] That's it?

01:17.545 --> 01:18.146
Yeah I know.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.480
Kinda disappointing, huh?

01:20.548 --> 01:21.749
I thought the monkey
was gonna fly into space.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.485
I guess that is the sequel.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.754
What did you think, mister?

01:31.225 --> 01:33.761
Can you read us a
book about ponies?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.196
Ponies?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.197
Yeah.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.731
Maybe next time, okay?

01:37.831 --> 01:40.100
But for right now,
it is your bedtime.

01:40.201 --> 01:43.371
So you and you,

01:45.639 --> 01:47.508
are going to bed.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.742
Okay?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.111
The last one read
us the pony book.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.413
The last one?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.348
[Megan] The last babysitter.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.783
Oh.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.885
Well why isn't she here tonight?

01:57.985 --> 01:59.653
She had a accident.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.291
An accident?

02:03.391 --> 02:06.694
Mama said (screams).

02:06.794 --> 02:10.497
I hope you two are running
to get ready for bed!

02:10.598 --> 02:13.534
(suspenseful music)

02:17.338 --> 02:19.673
Night-night you two.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.242
Sweet dreams.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.443
Nighty night.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.447
(suspenseful music)

03:06.320 --> 03:08.856
(phone ringing)

03:12.025 --> 03:14.695
Hello, Stroad residence.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.364
Oh, hi, Mr. Stroad.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.199
Yes, things are going great.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.670
I just put the little
troublemakers to bed.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.539
Oh my god.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.909
Is anyone hurt?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.815
Okay, you're on your way home?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.718
All right, well I will, uh,

03:37.818 --> 03:39.887
hold down the fort
until you get back.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.555
Okay, see you soon.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.268
The trail derailed
just outside of Clinton.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.804
Eyewitness reported
a massive fireball.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.541
Many residents of the local
area have already been removed.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.876
Now, representatives from
the railroad have not yet

04:02.976 --> 04:04.478
been reached for comment.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.780
Many local residents
left shaken.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.249
Now this train accident is
being deemed one of the worst

04:09.350 --> 04:11.251
in the state's history.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.421
There is no telling yet
how this is gonna impact

04:13.521 --> 04:14.855
the local commun...

04:20.394 --> 04:23.397
(suspenseful music)

04:40.080 --> 04:43.283
(clunking upstairs)

04:45.085 --> 04:48.288
(suspenseful music)

05:12.713 --> 05:15.315
(door slams)

05:34.468 --> 05:35.335
Megan?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.341
Ricky?

05:44.612 --> 05:45.479
Megan?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.056
Ricky?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.862
Ricky.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.764
You scared me.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.898
What are you doing?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.800
You need to go to bed.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.370
Why are you dressed like that?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.609
You better be
running to your room!

06:15.709 --> 06:18.646
(suspenseful music)

06:39.533 --> 06:41.669
(rattling)

06:55.949 --> 06:56.817
Ricky?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.557
Ricky, this isn't funny.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.974
(laughing)

07:41.161 --> 07:44.164
(suspenseful music)

08:12.626 --> 08:14.762
(screams)

08:17.765 --> 08:20.200
(creepy music)

10:24.024 --> 10:27.294
(general diner chatter)

10:36.469 --> 10:39.039
[Dylan] Are you gonna
finish that or what?

10:39.139 --> 10:39.907
Yup.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.678
[Dylan] Are you
gonna do that today?

10:44.778 --> 10:45.779
Yeah.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.914
You eat too fast.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.148
You eat too slow.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.917
We got shit to do, man.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.184
I don't wanna be here all day.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.054
Be nice to get home
by dark for once.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.323
But if you worked
a little faster,

10:56.423 --> 10:58.759
we'd get home at a decent time.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.760
I work slow?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.028
[Billy] Yeah.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.029
Really?

11:02.129 --> 11:03.363
[Billy] Uh-huh.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.173
(clattering dishes)

11:13.273 --> 11:15.876
[Diner] Cleanup in aisle six!

11:20.814 --> 11:21.915
Afternoon folks.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.350
What are you kids up to today?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.218
Concert in Columbus,
headed up that way.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.386
Ah, gotcha.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.121
I'm gonna hit the head.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.122
Yeah me, too.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.424
You two have fun in there.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.362
Sorry.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.236
Oh god.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.109
Mike.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.377
[Mike] Mm.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.845
Check it out.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.948
What do you think?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.716
[Mike] I think the
answer's still no,

11:56.817 --> 11:58.385
I'm not marrying you.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.953
It's for Sarah, idiot.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.721
I know that.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.356
We've been together
for almost two years

12:03.456 --> 12:04.324
and I think it's time.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.493
You, you and I have
been together for,

12:06.593 --> 12:09.429
I don't even know how
many years anymore.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.398
I've been trying to figure
out when the right time is.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.868
I feel like tonight's the night.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.736
She's gonna say yes.

12:16.837 --> 12:17.737
Lemme see.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.842
I don't know, man.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.377
I'm just trying to enjoy
life at this point.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.412
It's pretty.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.149
You ever thought
about it with Jill?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.183
No.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.384
No, it's been like eight months,

12:31.484 --> 12:33.153
I have not thought
about it with Jill.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.255
Are you sure you wanna
do it on this trip?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.924
Yes, that's my plan.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.060
Oh, please, please don't
do it on this trip, dude.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.061
[Brad] Why?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.296
Because, you two are
gonna start crying,

12:43.396 --> 12:45.032
and then Jill's gonna
start crying and

12:45.132 --> 12:48.135
then I'm not gonna cry, I'm
gonna look like an asshole.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.169
So what?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.303
It's not about you.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.905
It's about Sarah.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.408
You know how much I love her.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.277
No, no, I, you guys
are great together,

12:57.377 --> 12:59.913
she's a great girl, I got
nothing but good things to say.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.348
All right.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.350
If you are serious about
this, I do have one

13:03.450 --> 13:05.418
piece of advice for you.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.288
What's your one
piece of advice, Mike?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.957
(loud fart)

13:10.057 --> 13:11.024
Are you serious?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.226
(laughter)

13:14.594 --> 13:17.464
Hey, my water glass is empty,
think I could get a refill?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.366
[Waitress] I'll be
there in a minute!

13:19.466 --> 13:20.934
You boys have fun it there?

13:22.102 --> 13:22.569
Brad just had something
important he wanted to tell me.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.171
Dude.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.307
He just wanted to make sure
he was still bigger than me.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.041
Sorry about that.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.110
Oh, you're as quick as a fox.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.311
I try to be.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.847
Just let me know if I can
get you guys anything else.

13:33.947 --> 13:34.814
[Billy] Just the bill, please.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.448
Okay.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.984
[Billy] Thanks.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.092
Ma'am, could you tell
us how to get to the 137?

13:45.192 --> 13:46.927
We're trying to get to
Columbus but my phone keeps

13:47.027 --> 13:48.261
going in and out.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.265
It does that here, sweetheart,
it's called Southern Ohio.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.201
You ladies
heading to Columbus?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.468
Yes, we are.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.837
I can get you
there a lot quicker.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.974
You're gonna take the
highway south two exits,

14:01.074 --> 14:04.844
gonna turn right, go down
two streets and turn left.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.247
That puts you
right to route 137.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.381
You got that?

14:10.450 --> 14:13.320
That sounds like
in makes sense.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.257
Really?

14:19.592 --> 14:22.262
Hey, is there a problem here?

14:28.168 --> 14:29.269
No problem.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.642
I apologize for some
of the trailer trash

14:35.742 --> 14:37.377
that pass along through here.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.979
They don't know how
to treat a lady.

14:40.213 --> 14:40.647
You guys are headed down to
Columbus if I heard correctly?

14:41.581 --> 14:42.182
Yeah, trying to
make it to a concert.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.384
Well I wouldn't take the
137, there's some construction

14:45.585 --> 14:47.154
down there and I've, uh, gotten
some reports of some delays.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.555
I just wouldn't
chance it in a hurry.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.656
Do you know a better way?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.024
Well there's a faster way.

14:52.259 --> 14:52.892
Takes you to some small towns,
it's pretty easy to miss a,

14:53.826 --> 14:55.562
uh, turn you can get
lost, but it is faster.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.097
Up to you, though.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.066
I'm pretty sure we want to
get there as fast as possible.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.267
Do it.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.236
Alright, well lemme
see your map here.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.909
All right, that should be easy
enough for you to figure out.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.478
Thanks, Sheriff, we
appreciate the help.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.013
I just wouldn't
screw around in any of

15:13.113 --> 15:14.147
those small towns, though. It's.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.615
It's pretty easy
to get sidetracked.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.450
Nah, you've seen one backwater
town you've seen 'em all.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.152
Mike.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.153
[Mike] What?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.154
It's Ohio.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.322
Well, suit yourself.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.491
You guys have a safe trip.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.929
(suspenseful music)

15:31.664 --> 15:34.667
(branches breaking)

15:35.735 --> 15:38.938
(suspenseful music)

16:28.655 --> 16:31.058
(gurgling)

16:38.065 --> 16:41.501
* She's a hell bound sling

16:41.601 --> 16:44.671
* Burning up the line

16:46.139 --> 16:49.242
* Can't flag her down

16:49.342 --> 16:51.511
* She ain't got the time

16:51.611 --> 16:53.713
(laughter)

16:55.548 --> 16:57.150
Oh god.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.286
And then you woke up in the
morning and you, (laughter)

16:59.386 --> 17:02.289
you went to your sock drawer
and it was soaking wet

17:02.389 --> 17:04.057
and you're like, oh.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.327
But you didn't realize
babe that you were so drunk

17:07.426 --> 17:09.596
you had woken up in the middle
of the night to take a piss

17:09.695 --> 17:12.665
and you thought that your
sock drawer was the toilet.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.701
My sock drawer
is this tall on me.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.304
Like, I have no idea how
I even got up that high.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.571
Wait, is that the same
night that Brad went to bed

17:19.672 --> 17:21.741
wearing that ridiculous hat?

17:21.840 --> 17:22.809
[Jill] Yeah.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.176
Yes, yes it is.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.279
The furry hat, the babushka hat.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.282
(laughter)

17:29.382 --> 17:32.185
I've never seen
Brad that drunk.

17:32.852 --> 17:36.456
* And you don't wanna ride

17:36.556 --> 17:40.627
* Around the devil's train.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.566
I've gotta get gas soon.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.469
Well I can see if I can find
a gas station on my phone.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.070
Thank you, baby.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.711
What's wrong?

17:58.811 --> 18:00.313
[Jill] Uh, I
can't find my phone.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.848
[Mike] What do you mean
you can't find your phone?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.717
I mean I cant find my phone.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.785
[Mike] Great.

18:06.886 --> 18:07.587
Oh shit, guys, will you
look and see if my phone

18:08.255 --> 18:10.089
is back there by any chance?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.359
Shit.

18:13.326 --> 18:13.626
Babe, pull over, I've
gotta have my phone,

18:14.861 --> 18:15.795
it's got my credit card and
my IDs and all my shit in it.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.499
[Mike] I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.367
Fuck.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.379
Ugh, fuck.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.115
[Sarah] Did you
have it at the diner?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.884
Yeah, I mean I pulled
it out when we asked

18:37.984 --> 18:39.519
the waitress for directions.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.789
Shit, I put it on
the counter and then

18:42.889 --> 18:45.124
that creepy guy walked up.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.259
I must've left it there, shit!

18:46.359 --> 18:47.627
It's okay.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.229
I'm sure she picked it
up and she's probably

18:49.329 --> 18:50.763
just waiting for us
to go back and get it.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.565
If we go back now we're
gonna miss the show.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.234
Babe, what am
I supposed to do?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.535
It's got my ID in it.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.903
I don't know, I'm just saying.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.905
Guys, why don't we
just call the phone?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
See if the waitress has it.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.375
If she does, we'll just
pick it up on the way back

19:02.475 --> 19:03.243
from the concert.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.411
That's fine.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.186
[Man] Hello?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.321
Hello?

19:14.421 --> 19:15.488
Hi.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.557
Uh, my friend lost her phone
and this is her number.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.726
[Man] Yes, I believe I
have your friend's phone.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.595
Did you find it in the diner?

19:22.695 --> 19:23.496
Hello?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.399
Are you there?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.834
[Man] Where are you?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.836
I don't know,
we're on some road.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.405
We just wanna get the
phone back, please.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.706
[Man] Where are you?

19:33.806 --> 19:36.276
Guys, where the hell are we?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.444
[Brad] Who's on the phone?

19:37.544 --> 19:38.711
I don't know,
it's just some guy,

19:38.811 --> 19:39.946
he keeps asking me where we are.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.581
We're like 10 miles
east of Route 37.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.583
I think we're on Bradley?

19:43.683 --> 19:48.488
We're about 10 miles east
of Route 37 on Bradley Road.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.457
[Man] I can meet you
and return your phone.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.559
Oh, well why don't we
just meet you at the diner?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.860
[Man] No, keep driving.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.962
You'll pass a sign before
the railroad tracks.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.299
Turn left, go into town,
and meet me at 5th and Main.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.867
I'll be waiting.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.602
Okay, so we drive
down to where?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.503
Hello?

20:05.738 --> 20:06.606
Hello?

20:09.476 --> 20:10.710
He hung up.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.878
Well what'd he say?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.347
He said that there's
a town just up ahead,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.317
at an intersection, and
he's gonna meet us there.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.485
That's awesome.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.788
Let's do it, come on,
we're already late.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.764
(suspenseful music)

20:41.641 --> 20:43.510
Looks like we're here.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.259
So where is this guy?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.028
This is where the
guy wanted to meet.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.531
He better show,
he's got all my info.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.699
I can't believe I
fucking left it there.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.569
I'll try calling him again
and seeing if he's close.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.638
Just see where he's at.

21:11.738 --> 21:15.542
Oh, I have no signal,
guys, do you have one?

21:16.976 --> 21:17.910
No.

21:18.010 --> 21:18.811
Nothing.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.614
He's gonna show.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.286
I can't believe
this is happening.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.821
I'm so sorry, guys.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.561
(suspenseful music)

21:47.707 --> 21:50.410
I don't get it,
where is everybody?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.078
[Mike] I don't know,
babe but it's like,

21:52.178 --> 21:54.714
it's like they all just left.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.323
I mean, he has to
show up, right?

22:04.424 --> 22:07.560
I mean why the hell else would
he tell us to meet him here?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.597
(suspenseful music)

22:15.468 --> 22:17.604
[Jill] This is bullshit.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.612
[Brad] Hello?

22:31.918 --> 22:33.653
Anything?

22:33.753 --> 22:34.353
No.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.724
Let's just chill for a bit.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.459
This guy's gotta show up.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.893
We can sit by the gazebo.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.396
[Brad] That's a good idea.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.679
Anybody want some?

23:01.948 --> 23:03.416
I need to relax.

23:04.651 --> 23:07.620
I cannot believe I
left my damn phone.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.388
It's fine, seriously.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.490
Don't worry about it.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.058
This guy's gonna show up.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.428
Listen, baby, I
am not in the mood.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.664
That's what you said
on our first date.

23:17.764 --> 23:18.931
Oh, well that's when
I thought you were

23:19.031 --> 23:20.399
still going places.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.568
Ow.

23:21.668 --> 23:22.769
You thought he
was going places?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.070
How much did you
smoke that night?

23:24.170 --> 23:25.171
I went to college.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.839
Shoulda stayed gone.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.943
Oh, poor baby, let's
leave the poor baby alone.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.850
(suspenseful music)

23:56.969 --> 23:57.970
Are you gonna share that?

23:58.070 --> 23:59.071
Oh, no.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.674
Just gonna smoke all my weed?

24:01.774 --> 24:02.575
Yup.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.478
You're a dick.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.713
Yes I am.

24:06.813 --> 24:07.980
I am a dick.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.949
But speaking of dicks,
fucking Wiggins better

24:10.049 --> 24:11.684
pay us on time, man.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.586
I know, I'm getting
sick of it, too.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.455
Did you see his wife today?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.490
[Dylan] Oh my god.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.991
Did you see her fucking tits?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.693
I can live between
those fun bags.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.128
[Billy] That doesn't
even make sense.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.996
(laughs) Yeah it does.

24:24.096 --> 24:24.997
[Billy] It doesn't make sense.

24:25.965 --> 24:26.499
What do you mean it
doesn't make sense?

24:27.433 --> 24:27.700
[Billy] It doesn't
make any fucking sense.

24:28.367 --> 24:28.735
Fun bags, who says fun bags?

24:29.035 --> 24:29.802
Really?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.137
Yeah, it doesn't
make any sense.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.739
[Billy] What are you, 12?

24:32.839 --> 24:33.706
Fuck you.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.874
[Billy] You need to get laid.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.610
Pull over, I
gotta take a piss.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.188
Seriously, hurry up, dude.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.625
My chick's gonna kill
me if I'm late again.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.860
You're just gonna
have to sit there

24:53.960 --> 24:55.662
and wait for me then, aren't ya?

24:55.762 --> 24:56.663
You're funny.

24:56.763 --> 24:57.664
Hurry up!

24:57.764 --> 24:59.031
Hey, Billy?

24:59.131 --> 25:00.266
What?

25:00.366 --> 25:03.135
Will you come out here and
hold it, it's getting heavy.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.937
(laughter)

25:05.037 --> 25:06.005
You're an idiot.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.006
You know that?

25:07.106 --> 25:09.008
You're an idiot.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.176
[Billy] Find it yet?

25:10.276 --> 25:11.778
I don't know.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.782
Oh wait, there it is with you
mom's lipstick all over it.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.657
I think I'm gonna
cut through Clinton.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.825
Why do you wanna go that way?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.159
You never go that way.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.061
I think it's gonna be faster
with all the construction.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.163
Isn't that where all
those people went missing?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.532
I don't know, who cares?

25:47.947 --> 25:49.816
This is ridiculous.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.951
Where the hell is everybody?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.954
We're gonna miss
the god damn show.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.556
I don't know.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.058
What do you wanna do?

25:59.158 --> 26:00.226
I'm sick of waiting around.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.728
We need to get going
and we still need

26:01.828 --> 26:03.329
to find a gas station.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.097
Oh god, this fucking sucks.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.066
Babe, I'm sorry,
but we need to go.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.135
He's right, this
is ridiculous.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.071
We can try to call your phone
again when we get service.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.572
It's fine.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.976
I'll worry about it
later, let's just go.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.582
(suspenseful music)

26:38.064 --> 26:40.833
[Mike] Let's get
the hell out of here.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.302
(car clicking)

26:44.871 --> 26:46.372
Un-fucking-believable.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.373
[Jill] What's wrong, babe.

26:47.473 --> 26:48.374
[Brad] Try it again.

26:48.474 --> 26:49.375
I am.

26:49.475 --> 26:50.743
Are we out of gas?

26:50.843 --> 26:51.978
[Brad] It's not
even turning over,

26:52.078 --> 26:53.312
it doesn't sound
like no gas to me.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.215
Sounds more like
a dead battery.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.685
[Mike] Shit.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.203
Well you're not going
anywhere like this.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.005
[Mike] What do you mean?

27:19.105 --> 27:21.040
I don't know,
what do you think?

27:21.140 --> 27:21.908
Shit.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.644
What the hell are we gonna do?

27:29.448 --> 27:31.017
I don't know.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.019
Maybe we should try and find
a payphone or something.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.922
I mean how did
this even happen?

27:39.325 --> 27:40.993
It just happened.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.030
Hey, excuse me.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.666
Hey man, we're trying to find
a phone, can you help us out?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.301
[Brad] Who the hell is that?

27:49.401 --> 27:50.202
Hello?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.104
Hello?

27:52.204 --> 27:53.372
Do you have a phone?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.041
I don't think he
wants to be bothered.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.209
Guys, can we please
just keep going?

27:57.309 --> 27:59.678
She's right, we should go.

27:59.779 --> 28:00.679
Yeah, but.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.686
He was just, he was just there.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.457
[Jill] Babe, come on.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.459
[Mike] Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.227
He just disappeared.

28:30.509 --> 28:31.377
Hello?

28:35.447 --> 28:36.315
Hello?

28:38.851 --> 28:40.753
Where is everyone?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.255
The place is a
ghost town, man.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.123
Hello.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.295
[Brad] Hello.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.001
[Mike] Hello.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.336
Hello.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.914
Do you guys have a signal yet?

29:09.816 --> 29:10.482
Nothing.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.420
(creepy music)

29:34.040 --> 29:36.475
(horn honking)

29:39.311 --> 29:40.246
Are you okay?

29:41.180 --> 29:41.213
There was a guy
standing right there.

29:42.314 --> 29:42.982
What the hell are you doing? I
almost ran you over.

29:43.482 --> 29:43.916
Hey, calm down.

29:44.851 --> 29:45.184
There was a guy
standing right there.

29:46.485 --> 29:47.053
Who the hell runs
around in the middle of the god
damn street?

29:47.753 --> 29:47.786
He was standing right there.

29:48.087 --> 29:48.554
Chill.

29:48.654 --> 29:49.055
(crying)

29:49.455 --> 29:49.488
It's okay.

29:50.022 --> 29:50.322
Is she all right?

29:50.923 --> 29:51.457
- Yeah.
- You guys good?

29:51.991 --> 29:52.791
[Mike] Thank god.

29:53.926 --> 29:54.827
Do you guys have a cell
phone, our car broke down.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.028
No, my cellphone's dead.

29:56.128 --> 29:56.795
Where?

29:57.496 --> 29:58.330
He was standing right there.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.066
It's okay.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.934
Hey, Jill, it's okay.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.806
(screaming)

30:14.080 --> 30:16.248
(grunting)

30:17.649 --> 30:20.119
(screaming)

30:37.036 --> 30:39.939
(crying)

30:40.039 --> 30:42.374
(creepy music)

30:55.654 --> 30:58.024
(growling)

31:00.426 --> 31:02.861
(grunting)

31:07.266 --> 31:09.035
No, no, no, please.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.550
(screaming)

31:28.554 --> 31:30.990
[Brad] Let's go!

31:31.090 --> 31:34.026
(suspenseful music)

31:55.647 --> 31:58.684
[Sarah] Wait, where
are we gonna go?

31:58.784 --> 32:02.588
There, there, get in
there, come on, come on.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.087
(clanking metal)

32:51.137 --> 32:53.672
(bash on metal)

33:05.651 --> 33:08.020
(clanking)

33:37.716 --> 33:40.586
(knocking on bus)

34:07.579 --> 34:09.581
I don't hear anything.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.751
We need to keep moving.

34:12.851 --> 34:13.819
I can't.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.155
We need to baby, we need to.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.324
I can't, I can't.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.426
We have to, we have to.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.760
Fuck this.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.163
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.331
Wait.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.399
We need to sick together.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.168
I ain't staying.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.471
He's right, we need to go.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.829
(whimpering)

35:00.799 --> 35:02.368
We gotta find a
way out of here.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.503
Come on, guys, we
gotta keep moving.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.205
I can't, I can't.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.240
Maybe I can, maybe I can.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.110
All right.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.747
I'm gonna go check this
RV, make sure it's safe.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.216
You guys stay here, okay?

35:17.316 --> 35:18.116
Okay.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.396
Brad.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.333
Okay, let's go.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.640
[Mike] Where's Jill?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.842
She was right behind us.

35:43.942 --> 35:44.743
Jill.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.484
Jill.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.553
Jill.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.458
She was right here.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.426
Jill!

36:00.526 --> 36:01.927
She was right here.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.295
Jill.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.697
Turn the fucking light off.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.705
Shut the fuck up.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.608
These are her
bracelets. (Whimpering)

36:16.708 --> 36:18.544
Motherfuckers!

36:18.644 --> 36:21.280
Shut your fucking mouth or
they're gonna fucking get us.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.581
Shut your fucking mouth.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.882
Guys, we gotta go right now.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.451
Let's go, come on.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.352
Come on.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.188
(creepy music)

36:38.864 --> 36:40.399
[Dylan] Get in.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.468
[Mike] In here, come on.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.335
Go, go.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.745
(creepy music)

37:10.829 --> 37:13.632
(metal clanking)

37:49.835 --> 37:53.305
(bat scraping on metal)

38:06.685 --> 38:09.388
(glass shattering)

38:09.488 --> 38:10.856
(screaming)

38:10.956 --> 38:11.823
Fuck you!

38:16.562 --> 38:18.930
(growl)

38:19.030 --> 38:19.831
Fuck you!!

38:25.737 --> 38:29.007
(screaming and yelling)

38:49.461 --> 38:52.431
Come on, hey, come
on, come out this way!

38:52.531 --> 38:53.331
Come on!

39:00.739 --> 39:01.607
Go!

39:02.874 --> 39:05.744
Come on, you motherfucker!

39:05.844 --> 39:09.615
Mike, Mike, come on,
let's go, Mike come on!

39:12.484 --> 39:15.587
Follow me, I know a way out!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.624
(suspenseful music)

39:25.163 --> 39:26.031
Come on!

39:28.700 --> 39:29.901
Where's the police station?

39:30.001 --> 39:30.902
[Dylan] They killed someone!

39:31.002 --> 39:31.903
They killed my brother!

39:32.003 --> 39:32.871
I know, I know!

39:32.971 --> 39:33.905
Where is it?! Where is it?

39:34.005 --> 39:34.940
Where's my girlfriend?

39:35.807 --> 39:36.141
What the fuck did
they do with her?

39:36.642 --> 39:37.042
We gotta go now!

39:37.342 --> 39:38.109
Come on!

39:38.209 --> 39:41.513
Come on, we've
gotta follow him.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.049
(intense music)

39:49.955 --> 39:51.490
[Sarah] Where
are you taking us?

39:51.590 --> 39:52.658
[Man] No!

39:52.758 --> 39:54.025
What the hell
are we doing here?

39:54.125 --> 39:55.160
We need to find Jill, now.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.496
I am trying to help you!

39:57.596 --> 39:59.030
I think I may know where she is.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.132
We need to go inside now!

40:02.968 --> 40:04.169
Come! Come!

40:04.269 --> 40:06.438
Come on, let's just go.

40:15.213 --> 40:19.551
(door slamming/locking)

40:22.087 --> 40:23.689
[Man] All right.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.692
[Brad] Where are we?

40:26.792 --> 40:28.193
Home.

40:28.293 --> 40:29.828
Come, sit down.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.096
Sit down, here.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.131
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.165
Yeah, here.

40:35.100 --> 40:35.967
Great.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.670
So this is your home.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.971
So where's Jill?

40:41.973 --> 40:43.509
You deaf old man?

40:45.110 --> 40:45.977
Water.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.814
Uh.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.549
Do you have a, a car?

40:50.649 --> 40:52.150
Or a phone we can use?

40:52.250 --> 40:53.952
No car, no phone neither.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.087
What were you doing
in the junkyard?

40:56.187 --> 40:57.455
Shopping.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.590
For what?

40:58.690 --> 40:59.625
Eh, stuff.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.695
Listen, mister, we
appreciate the hospitality...

41:03.795 --> 41:04.863
Frank!

41:04.963 --> 41:06.031
Name is Frank.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.000
Frank, we appreciate
the hospitality but we

41:09.100 --> 41:11.102
can't stay here,
we need the police.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.971
(chuckles)

41:13.071 --> 41:15.741
Listen, you crazy old bastard!

41:17.809 --> 41:20.011
No cops, you got it?

41:20.111 --> 41:21.012
No cops.

41:21.112 --> 41:21.880
No cops.

41:26.752 --> 41:27.619
Sit down.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.763
So there's no
police around here?

41:37.863 --> 41:40.899
The county sheriff, he just
don't come around very much.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.634
I don't get it,
there's one cop in town?

41:42.734 --> 41:43.869
Where's everybody at?

41:43.969 --> 41:45.203
First, eat, eh?

41:54.780 --> 41:57.215
This guy is clearly insane.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.618
Let's just leave him
be and go find Jill.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.186
Look, I know this
night's been crazy,

42:01.286 --> 42:03.021
but we will find Jill.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.191
But first we gotta figure
out what we're gonna do.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.193
Fine, whatever.

42:08.293 --> 42:11.196
Listen, this guy
knows something.

42:13.064 --> 42:16.067
(suspenseful music)

42:27.145 --> 42:31.082
(crying/whimpering)

42:43.962 --> 42:46.865
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:46.965 --> 42:49.835
Oh no, oh my god,
please let me go!

42:51.703 --> 42:52.570
Oh please!

42:55.106 --> 42:56.708
Oh my god, please!

42:59.845 --> 43:01.146
Oh my god, please!

43:03.782 --> 43:04.650
Oh no.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.892
I'm gonna make you so pretty.

43:15.126 --> 43:17.796
(creepy music)

43:28.006 --> 43:29.307
You doin' okay?

43:43.789 --> 43:44.656
Hey.

43:45.356 --> 43:46.224
Hey.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.865
We're gonna make it
through this, I promise.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.200
You know I never even
liked country music

43:55.300 --> 43:57.068
that much anyway.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.303
I know.

43:58.403 --> 44:00.071
I just wanted us to
have a fun night.

44:00.171 --> 44:00.939
Me, too.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.677
At least we're in this together.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.045
Could be worse.

44:09.781 --> 44:12.117
We could be eating that food.

44:17.956 --> 44:19.057
What is that?

44:23.194 --> 44:25.363
You gonna eat that?

44:25.463 --> 44:26.264
[Sarah] No.

44:29.467 --> 44:32.203
[Brad] That's you
in this picture.

44:32.303 --> 44:33.739
With your family.

44:35.206 --> 44:38.076
[Frank] A long time ago.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.377
What happened?

44:43.815 --> 44:44.682
Clowns.

44:52.090 --> 44:55.827
This town used to be a
train hub, years ago.

44:57.128 --> 44:59.397
It was a nice place to live.

45:00.966 --> 45:02.934
Before the big wreck.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.369
After that there
wasn't much to it,

45:04.469 --> 45:07.072
there wasn't much sense in
sticking around, you know?

45:07.172 --> 45:10.041
The jobs left,
folks soon followed.

45:11.376 --> 45:15.380
People that stayed they mostly
just keep to themselves.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.088
Ah, some girls went missing
about that same time,

45:23.188 --> 45:27.292
between the wreck and the
girls, people got spooked.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.861
What about the clowns?

45:29.961 --> 45:30.728
Clowns.

45:33.264 --> 45:36.434
Clowns are like a,
like a pack of dogs.

45:39.004 --> 45:39.871
Or ghosts.

45:42.007 --> 45:44.275
Haunted this town for years.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.012
You'll hear people
whisper about 'em

45:47.112 --> 45:50.148
but you won't hear
'em talk about 'em.

45:52.818 --> 45:56.955
Through the years, more and
more people went missing.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.396
They never, never catch anybody.

46:05.496 --> 46:06.431
Find anybody.

46:08.199 --> 46:11.769
Some people think the
clowns don't exist.

46:12.938 --> 46:15.140
People say the people
who went missing,

46:15.240 --> 46:19.310
it's 'cause they just went
off to find a better life.

46:21.479 --> 46:24.182
Get back here you stupid dog!

46:25.183 --> 46:26.784
Son of a bitch!

46:26.885 --> 46:27.919
Motherfucker.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.855
Stupid dog.

46:30.989 --> 46:33.024
What are you looking at?

46:33.124 --> 46:36.061
(suspenseful music)

46:57.415 --> 47:00.351
I told you he was
a fucking screw-up.

47:00.451 --> 47:01.486
Yes.

47:01.586 --> 47:03.454
Next time, believe me.

47:03.554 --> 47:05.223
Uh, hey listen, I gotta go.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.825
I'll talk to you Monday, bye.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.497
(laughter) Asshole.

47:13.899 --> 47:14.565
Ah!

47:16.401 --> 47:19.270
(smashing window)

47:21.973 --> 47:24.475
People are in denial.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.377
People that live here.

47:27.545 --> 47:30.115
They lock their doors at night.

47:30.215 --> 47:33.851
The people that live
here, they stay inside.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.855
The clowns own this town now.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.026
I heard rumors of clowns
in this town but I thought

47:41.126 --> 47:44.262
it was bullshit to scare people.

47:44.362 --> 47:48.433
I heard it all started with
some crazy messed up family.

47:51.002 --> 47:53.304
I don't know
nothing 'bout that.

47:53.404 --> 47:56.041
What about other people
that have come through here?

47:56.141 --> 47:58.009
Eh, them people that
come through they,

47:58.109 --> 47:59.244
they don't stay long.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.511
There's nothing here.

48:00.611 --> 48:01.612
Ones that do.

48:02.948 --> 48:06.117
You've seen what
could happen, eh?

48:06.217 --> 48:08.253
You said you knew
where Jill was.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.520
Where is she?

48:09.620 --> 48:11.189
Yeah, I think...

48:11.289 --> 48:13.124
(loud bang)

48:13.224 --> 48:14.425
What was that?

48:16.962 --> 48:17.628
No.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.166
It can't be.

48:21.266 --> 48:22.567
What about Jill?

48:23.701 --> 48:24.569
Shh.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.675
We need to leave here now!

48:30.775 --> 48:32.410
Go!

48:32.510 --> 48:33.311
Come on.

48:37.715 --> 48:40.918
(suspenseful music)

48:53.064 --> 48:56.467
They usually
don't come in here.

48:56.567 --> 48:59.070
They must want you
guys pretty bad.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.505
We didn't do anything.

49:00.605 --> 49:03.141
You got away, that's enough.

49:05.343 --> 49:08.346
(suspenseful music)

50:50.448 --> 50:54.185
I don't think I
can hear him anymore.

50:54.285 --> 50:56.587
(gasps)

50:56.687 --> 50:58.689
(banging)

50:58.789 --> 50:59.590
Dylan!

50:59.690 --> 51:00.591
Dylan!

51:00.691 --> 51:01.759
Dylan! Dylan!?

51:02.727 --> 51:04.462
Come on, man.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.331
You wanna do this?

51:06.431 --> 51:07.832
Nice fucking makeup job.

51:07.932 --> 51:08.833
Dylan!

51:08.933 --> 51:09.700
It's too late.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.302
[Brad] Dylan!

51:11.402 --> 51:13.204
[Mike] Dylan! Dylan?!

51:15.140 --> 51:16.407
Fuck you, man!

51:18.343 --> 51:20.511
(groaning)

51:40.231 --> 51:43.734
(banging on door)

51:43.834 --> 51:46.471
(screaming)

51:46.571 --> 51:48.105
(yelling)

51:48.206 --> 51:49.340
[Brad] Come on, let's go!

51:49.440 --> 51:51.509
[Frank] This way, quick!

51:52.577 --> 51:55.246
(creepy music)

52:13.931 --> 52:15.400
Oh, ow! Oh, ow!

52:16.301 --> 52:17.268
Are you all right?

52:17.368 --> 52:19.837
In here, in here! Ow!

52:19.937 --> 52:20.705
[Mike] Shh.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.407
Here, go, go, go.

52:25.543 --> 52:26.411
Shh.

52:34.219 --> 52:34.885
Come on.

52:36.421 --> 52:39.424
(suspenseful music)

52:48.366 --> 52:52.303
(baseball bat scraping ground)

53:25.270 --> 53:27.805
(doors banging)

53:36.046 --> 53:39.250
(suspenseful music)

53:49.927 --> 53:51.496
[Brad] Come on.

53:52.763 --> 53:56.501
(intense suspenseful music)

54:12.650 --> 54:14.652
There's nowhere to go.

54:18.055 --> 54:21.659
(metal scraping the wall)

54:52.690 --> 54:54.825
(banging)

55:21.986 --> 55:24.321
(panting)

56:05.430 --> 56:07.965
(door slamming)

56:15.172 --> 56:17.642
(screaming)

56:23.047 --> 56:25.516
(grunting)

56:51.075 --> 56:53.478
(coughing)

56:57.214 --> 56:59.016
Brad, are you okay?

57:00.851 --> 57:01.719
Get up!

57:03.988 --> 57:05.122
I said get up!

57:11.629 --> 57:13.964
(whimpering)

57:21.506 --> 57:23.774
(grunting)

57:56.674 --> 57:57.542
My god.

58:00.277 --> 58:01.746
Where's Dylan?

58:11.221 --> 58:12.557
What the hell?

58:13.290 --> 58:14.625
That's Jill's phone.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.794
How the hell
does he have that?

58:16.894 --> 58:19.063
He was in the diner.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.631
What do you mean?

58:20.731 --> 58:25.770
I remember seeing
this tattoo before.

58:25.870 --> 58:27.037
He was the busboy.

58:27.137 --> 58:28.038
Mother...

58:28.138 --> 58:29.173
Mike, wait!

58:29.273 --> 58:30.608
We gotta go!

58:30.708 --> 58:32.509
They're gonna come
back looking for ya!

58:32.610 --> 58:33.510
He's right.

58:33.611 --> 58:35.012
We gotta go.

58:35.112 --> 58:37.782
We gotta go now, come on, Sarah.

58:40.818 --> 58:43.788
You're coming with us, right?

58:43.888 --> 58:46.190
With this bum leg
I'll just slow you down.

58:46.290 --> 58:48.893
Besides, this is still my home.

58:48.993 --> 58:50.661
Where did they take Jill?

58:50.761 --> 58:52.196
I'll write it down for ya.

58:52.296 --> 58:53.831
Come on, let's go.

58:57.334 --> 59:01.205
(screaming/crying)

59:15.820 --> 59:16.821
Oh please.

59:26.096 --> 59:30.234
Oh no, did my dolly get left
outside by those dirty boys?

59:31.836 --> 59:33.971
(sobbing)

59:38.108 --> 59:39.977
We don't like dirty boys, do we?

59:40.077 --> 59:40.978
No, no, no.

59:41.979 --> 59:45.215
But we do like ponies, don't we?

59:45.315 --> 59:46.583
I love ponies.

59:47.251 --> 59:48.686
They're my favorite.

59:48.786 --> 59:50.587
You like ponies don't you?

59:50.688 --> 59:53.824
You love ponies just like I do.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.726
Please, please stop.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.096
Please.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:00.731
Oh my god, please!

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:01.899
I love you so much.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.367
My beautiful little
porcelain doll.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:06.270
You can't be sad
and this pretty.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.171
Oh.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:12.042
(screaming)

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.152
Please let me go.

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:24.621
Oh my god, please let me go.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:26.657
Oh please.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.078
All right, come on, let's go.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.084
Oh nice, the keys?

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.688
Oh, oh thank god.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.325
We'll find Jill and get going.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:20.044
All right, the
turn should be j...

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:21.946
What the hell is that?

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:25.349
Why are you stopping?

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.383
[Sarah] How did he get here?

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:29.053
[Mike] Come on, guys,
we need to keep moving.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:30.955
[Brad] Just hold
on, something's wrong.

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:33.858
Brad, we need to get Jill
and get the fuck out of here.

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:34.759
Brad.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.394
Brad!

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.064
Just stay in the truck.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:42.132
[Mike] Brad! Brad!

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:43.901
Stay in the truck!

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.043
Frank, is that you?

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:55.780
Frank.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:00.851
Frank?

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:02.853
Frank?

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.189
Oh my god, Frank!

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:08.959
They did this to you.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:09.860
Come on.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.164
[Mike] Jesus.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:15.199
Oh my god.

01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:19.269
[Brad] Frank,
tell me what to do.

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.405
Helping you was enough.

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:24.174
Oh god.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:40.791
[Frank] Go.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:45.796
(screaming)

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:49.900
Sarah!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.169
(screaming)

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:02.546
Go, go, go.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:03.881
Brad!

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:05.182
I'll find you!

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:09.786
(creepy suspenseful music)

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.513
(growls)

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:45.022
(dog barking)

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:49.559
(suspenseful music)

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.298
Hey!

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:57.935
(knocking)

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:59.203
Hello.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.504
(knocking)

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:01.371
Hello?

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.874
I need help.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:06.911
(suspenseful music)

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:18.989
Hello?

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:26.330
Hello.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:34.004
I'm sorry for coming in like
this, but I need your help.

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:37.407
There's been a murder, I
need to find the police.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.409
Please, can you help me?

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.113
Can you help me?

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:46.116
What are you doing hanging
out around here at night?

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.287
Don't you know it's dangerous,
playing outside at night.

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:54.491
Bad things can happen.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:57.294
Bad things.

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.397
I need help, do
you have a car?

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:03.433
A car? (Laughter)

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:07.171
No use for a car.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:12.109
My son brings his mama
everything she needs.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:15.045
Your son, that's great.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:16.913
I just need a car or
a way out of here,

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:19.583
I got separated from my friends.

01:05:19.683 --> 01:05:22.586
I think you should
just stay with me.

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.454
My son will help you.

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:26.490
Yes he will.

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:29.493
When will he be here?

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:30.394
Soon.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:32.129
Very soon.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:36.266
(suspenseful music)

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:54.451
I think, I think we lost 'em.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.220
We have to find Brad!

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.587
We have to find Jill.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:05:59.523
We'll send for the cops, Brad
can take care of himself.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:00.657
He's your best friend!

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:02.659
And what's Jill?

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:04.194
Brad had the directions.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.095
Fuck!

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:06.963
All right.

01:06:08.232 --> 01:06:10.334
We gotta get back to town.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:11.601
Town?

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:13.337
We need to get
back to the truck!

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.205
Those clowns are
gonna be waiting for us.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:17.341
Town is the only place
we all know, that's where

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.609
Brad will go, I promise you.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.379
Come on, we gotta go, let's go.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.218
You were living here back
during the train wreck.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.254
And when those
girls went missing.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.656
Word had it those girls
were sticking their noses

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:35.092
where they didn't belong.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.993
Not polite to do that.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.397
Is that right?

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:44.000
A mama has to protect her son.

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:46.436
A son has to protect his mama.

01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:59.583
Frank, he was your husband.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:05.021
Still is if the law
has anything to say.

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:13.297
Your son's one of the clowns.

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:14.598
He killed those girls!

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:17.067
Don't you put that on Ricky!

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:20.470
It wasn't little Ricky's
fault what happened.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:21.771
He's a good boy.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.041
A very good boy.

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:29.313
(laughter)

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.298
Not Ricky's fault, huh?

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.600
Is that why Frank left you?

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.569
After what happened?

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:56.573
A mother has stronger
ties than a father does.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:59.075
Always been, always will be.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:04.348
And a mother always,

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.818
always has to protect her son.

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.223
No matter what.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:20.397
(dog barking)

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:26.536
(suspenseful music)

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:03.673
Stupid!

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:10.680
You don't want to disappoint
mommy now, do you?

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.191
(creak)

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.694
(growl)

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:52.756
(door slamming)

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:42.772
All right, there's the gazebo.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.374
Come on, let's go.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:53.283
(engine rumbling)

01:11:12.536 --> 01:11:15.839
(door slamming)

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.875
(suspenseful music)

01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:46.936
All right, this is
our chance, come on.

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.338
- Wait.
- [Mike] What?

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.340
That could be our
ticket out of here.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.842
You think we can
drive that thing?

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.711
It's worth a shot.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.580
All right, come on.

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:01.050
All right, go, go.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.455
(screaming)

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:10.760
(sobbing, screaming)

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.747
(creepy music)

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.067
(whimpering)

01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:29.072
Mike?

01:13:29.172 --> 01:13:29.973
Mike!

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.411
Oh, come on, wake up!

01:13:39.683 --> 01:13:40.950
Help me, please.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.567
Jill?

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:02.105
Baby, can you hear me?

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:05.441
Jill?

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:13.449
Let me go.

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:15.184
Let me go!

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.954
Get me out of this chair!

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:18.988
[Sarah] Mike?

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.123
God damn it!

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:21.591
Let me go!

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.560
Get me out of this chair!

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.094
Let me go!

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:25.995
Let me go!

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:29.165
God damn it!

01:14:29.265 --> 01:14:30.066
Ah!

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:33.837
Get me out a here!

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:34.704
Oh sheriff!

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:35.605
Help us, please!

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:37.140
[Sheriff] Shut up!

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:41.144
(screaming)

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:53.790
[Sarah] Mike.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:58.261
(screaming, crying)

01:14:58.361 --> 01:14:59.763
Shut, shut her up.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.798
Shut her up, man!

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.033
Just shut 'em all up!

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.002
Get her to shut up!

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.504
I'm telling you,
get her to shut up!

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.506
Get her to shut up, man!

01:15:13.777 --> 01:15:16.045
[Jill] Oh my god, please!

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:20.917
Oh god!

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.922
(screaming)
