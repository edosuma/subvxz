PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:04.004 --> 00:05.962
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU MAKE ME A MARTYR.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.573
INDRA: YES, THE SAME
THING THAT HAPPENS

00:08.617 --> 00:11.489
IF ANYONE FINDS OUT
WHO YOU ARE,

00:11.533 --> 00:15.058
ONLY THEN,
AS THE PEOPLE RIOT

00:15.102 --> 00:17.060

OF THEIR GOD,

00:17.104 --> 00:19.149
I CAN SLIT
YOUR THROAT.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.108
GABRIEL: I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

00:21.151 --> 00:25.416
NO NEED FOR SPACESHIPS
OR CRYO OR MIND DRIVES.

00:25.460 --> 00:29.116
YOU COULD EXPLORE
AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.171
OCTAVIA, DON'T
TELL THEM ANYTHING!

00:50.311 --> 00:52.487
I SEE YOU GUYS DON'T
GET MANY VISITORS.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.619
EYES
FORWARD.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.143
DO THAT AGAIN,
AND THAT SCAR

04:05.027 --> 04:06.594
UNLIKE ANYTHING
HE'D EVER SEEN.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.291
INDRA: JACKSON HASN'T
SEEN A LOT OF ARMOR.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.641
CLARKE AND GAIA HAVE.
THEY'LL BE HOME SOON.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.513
IF NOT, I'LL SEND
A TEAM AFTER THEM, OK?

04:12.556 --> 04:14.819
DO YOU EVEN HAVE
A TEAM TO SEND?

04:14.863 --> 04:16.517
DID JACKSON
TELL YOU THAT, TOO?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.606
NO. I HEARD YOU
IN THE KITCHEN.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.347
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.395
GO ON.
DON'T BE LATE.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.182
INDRA, WE
NEED TO TALK.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.718
HEY, INDRA--

04:43.761 --> 04:46.329
SIT DOWN, NELSON.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.856
WHY IS THE PRISONER
OUT OF HIS CELL?

04:55.338 --> 04:58.210
INDRA TAUGHT ME
A FEW WORDS.

04:58.254 --> 05:01.301
LINDO, TAKE HIM
BACK INSIDE.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.782
NICE TALKING
TO YOU, OTIS.

05:04.826 --> 05:08.133
I'M SURE YOU'LL NOW
BE REASSIGNED.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.616
WHAT?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.009
OUR ORDERS ARE
THAT HE GETS

05:14.052 --> 05:16.359
10 MINUTES OUTSIDE
TWICE A DAY.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.795
NOT ANYMORE,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.319
AND BECAUSE YOU
WERE ALSO ORDERED

05:19.362 --> 05:20.711
NOT TO SPEAK TO HIM--
HE'S CORRECT--

05:20.755 --> 05:22.452
YOU ARE BEING
RELIEVED.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.585
GO NOW.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.326
MMPH.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.287
SEYA, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.115
WE NEED EVERY
LOYAL MAN WE'VE GOT.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.682
WHAT DID THEY
TALK ABOUT?

05:34.725 --> 05:36.423
NOTHING MUCH.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.642
RUSSELL WAS CURIOUS
ABOUT EARTH. THAT'S ALL.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.950
FROM NOW ON, ONLY TRIKRU
GUARDS THE PRISONER.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.647
YOU ARE NOT
TO SPEAK TO HIM.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.127
IF HE TRIES
SPEAKING TO YOU,

05:45.170 --> 05:46.781
YOU ARE AUTHORIZED
TO SHUT HIM UP.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.399
INDRA...

05:56.443 --> 05:58.053
EXCUSE ME,

05:58.096 --> 06:00.142
BUT IF WE'RE SEEN
BEATING THEIR LEADER--

06:00.185 --> 06:02.057
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.712
USE ONE OF
THE COGs TO DO IT.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.192
NOW STAND YOUR POST.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.587
LEAVE US.

06:17.551 --> 06:21.424
YOU ARE MY PRISONER.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.818
YOU WILL NOT BE
REMOVED FROM THIS CELL.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.689
YOU WILL NOT SPEAK
TO MY GUARDS,

06:25.733 --> 06:27.865
AND YOU WILL NOT SO
MUCH AS LOOK AT THEM

06:27.909 --> 06:29.301
WITHOUT
MY PERMISSION.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.391
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:46.884 --> 06:49.409
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.802
THE MOMENT YOU STOP
BEING USEFUL,

06:51.846 --> 06:54.109
I WILL KILL YOU
MYSELF.

06:54.152 --> 06:57.025
SO YOU KEEP
SAYING. HMM.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.899
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO
SINCE SO FEW OF OUR PEOPLE

07:01.943 --> 07:05.816
ARE FOLLOWING
YOUR ORDERS NOW,

07:05.860 --> 07:09.080
BAD TIME TO LOSE TRACK
OF ALL THOSE GUNS.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.694
I HEAR THINGS.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.697
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A HEDA.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.439
ALAS, THE CHILD
IS BROKEN.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.267
PERHAPS CLARKE
COULD LEAD.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.662
SHE DID ONCE BEAR
THE FLAME, AFTER ALL,

07:25.706 --> 07:31.015
A CLAIM ONLY
3 OF US CAN MAKE,

07:31.059 --> 07:34.802
AND THAT IS WHAT
YOU'RE REALLY AFRAID OF,

07:34.845 --> 07:37.152
ISN'T IT,

07:37.195 --> 07:40.938
THAT THEY'LL
FOLLOW ME.

07:45.421 --> 07:49.469
I WOULD BE, TOO,
IF I WAS YOU.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.091
GUARDS.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.363
CLARKE: BELLAMY!

08:17.018 --> 08:22.197
OCTAVIA! ECHO!

08:22.240 --> 08:24.460
SAFE TO SAY, WE'RE
ON THE WRONG PLANET.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.027
I AGREE.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.550
IF THESE PEOPLE COULD
CHOOSE A NEW WORLD

08:27.594 --> 08:30.161
FOR A HOME, IT
WOULDN'T BE THIS ONE.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.773
I DON'T KNOW.

08:32.816 --> 08:35.689
I THINK IT'S
PRETTY COOL.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.213
"COOL."
GET IT?

08:38.256 --> 08:40.868
MILLER'S RIGHT.
WE MOVE ON.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.917
AHH. ACCORDING
TO THE COMPUTER,

08:46.961 --> 08:50.007
THE STONE'S NEAR...
THOSE ROCKS,

08:50.051 --> 08:52.227
TWO KILOMETERS
THAT WAY.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.750
I SEE THE CAVE
ENTRANCE.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.100
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.450
THERE'S SOMETHING BURIED
IN THE SNOW HERE.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.632
IT'S A BODY.

09:05.675 --> 09:09.723
HAVE I MENTIONED THAT
I DON'T LIKE IT HERE?

09:09.766 --> 09:11.594
OSSUARIUM.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.943
WHAT?

09:12.987 --> 09:14.597
RAVEN: THE PLANET'S
PRIMARY USE.

09:14.641 --> 09:18.732
I'M PRETTY SURE IT MEANS
A PLACE TO STORE YOUR DEAD.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.386
I'VE SEEN THAT
SYMBOL BEFORE.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.258
SHOW ME THE STAR MAP.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.694
I BET YOU IT'S
THE PLANET WHERE

09:24.738 --> 09:25.913
THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK
OUR FRIENDS ARE FROM.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.175
- KNIFE.
- HERE.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.786
THANKS.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.354
UH! AH!

09:32.397 --> 09:35.487
HUH. HUMAN.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.101
BUMMER.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.670
WHAT?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.976
SEEING AN ALIEN
WOULD BE AWESOME.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.413
HERE.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.199
AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING NOW.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.421
LET'S FIND THAT STONE
AND GET OUR FRIENDS BACK.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.618
JORDAN:
UH...

10:18.661 --> 10:19.662
DON'T BE SUCH WIMPS.

10:21.359 --> 10:25.189
COME ON. THE STONE'S
200 METERS THIS WAY.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.930
UHH...

10:32.153 --> 10:34.459
WISH THIS THING
HAD A LIGHT.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.811
HEH. COOL.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.511
I HOPE NO ONE'S
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.122
MILLER: ARE WE
REALLY DOING THIS? OH...

10:52.260 --> 10:54.915
WHAT'S
THAT SMELL?

11:00.964 --> 11:03.140
IT IS ME, OR IS IT
WARM IN HERE?

11:03.184 --> 11:04.881
IT'S NOT YOU.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.188
THE TEMPERATURE'S UP
50 DEGREES FROM THE SURFACE.

11:07.231 --> 11:11.105
THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF
THERMAL HEAT SOURCE DOWN HERE.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.632
HUH!

11:18.416 --> 11:21.855
RAVEN: 150 METERS.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.642
HUH. THERE'S AN OPENING
UP AHEAD.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.478
ANYONE ELSE
HEAR THAT?

11:36.521 --> 11:38.698
I SURE DID.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.144
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:51.885 --> 11:54.757
CLARKE: RAVEN,
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.933
Something's down here.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.249
GOD! AAH! AAH! AAH!

12:08.292 --> 12:11.643
- AAH!
- GO BACK! GO BACK!

12:11.687 --> 12:13.036
JORDAN: SHOOT IT
WITH THE LASER!

12:13.080 --> 12:14.385
NO. IT'S A CAVE.
IT COULD COLLAPSE ON US.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.474
RAVEN: AAH! AAH!

12:16.518 --> 12:19.564
AAH! AAH! OH! UH!

12:19.608 --> 12:23.830
UH! UH!

12:23.873 --> 12:26.267
YAH! UH!

12:28.617 --> 12:31.968
RAVEN, ARE YOU OK?

12:32.012 --> 12:35.711
YEAH. IT'S GONE.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.630
CLARKE: OK. WE'VE
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.763
JORDAN: WAIT. WE'RE GOING
TOWARDS THAT THING?

12:43.806 --> 12:46.461
CLARKE: WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE STONE.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.869
CLARKE: UH...UH!

13:06.873 --> 13:09.092
HEY, ARE
YOU HURT?

13:09.136 --> 13:13.575
NO. I'M FINE.
YEAH.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.886
- WHAT WAS IT?
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

13:19.929 --> 13:21.713
WE SHOULD GO
BACK, RIGHT?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.019
THERE MIGHT BE
MORE OF THEM.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.938
GUYS...

13:32.594 --> 13:35.815
WHERE'S THE
DAMN TUNNEL?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.605
UH!

13:45.825 --> 13:49.959
JORDAN: WHAT
THE HELL? ACID.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.440
WE'RE NOT GOING
THAT WAY, ANYWAY.

13:52.483 --> 13:55.573
COME ON.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.537
THE STONE'S THIS WAY.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.759
MILLER: YOU, UH, STILL
THINK ALIENS ARE AWESOME?

14:27.605 --> 14:28.998
OH, HEY.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.521
HOW'S YOUR BOY?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.915
ALIVE,
THANKS TO YOU.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
YOU WANT A DRINK?

14:34.961 --> 14:36.788
ME? WITH YOU?

14:36.832 --> 14:39.966
YEAH.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.930
EXCUSE ME, BUT I NEED
TO BORROW YOUR GOD.

14:47.974 --> 14:51.107
HEY, IT'S OK.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:51.151 --> 14:53.718
JEREMIAH.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.982
I'D SAY WE GO WITH JERRY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.941
ALL RIGHT. PERFECT.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.161
PROBABLY GONNA NEED
TO OWE YOU THAT DRINK,

15:01.204 --> 15:03.728
THOUGH, JER.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.996
OH, I'M NOT GONNA
LIKE THIS, AM I?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.475
OUR GUNS WERE STOLEN.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.129
I NEED YOUR HELP
GETTING THEM BACK.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.478
MM.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.219
THE LEADER
OF THE CONVICTS,

15:16.263 --> 15:18.091
THE ONE WHO DIED
IN THE REACTOR,

15:18.134 --> 15:20.397
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
OF HIS THIEF WIFE?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.617
OH, MACHINE GUN
ANNIE?

15:22.660 --> 15:24.924
SHE AND HATCH
WERE BANK ROBBERS.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.100
HATCH LIKED THE MONEY.
SHE LIKED THE CHAOS.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.406
IF SHE'S GOT THE GUNS,
WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.018
LET'S FIND OUT.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.903
INDRA: THERE WAS A BREAK-IN
LAST NIGHT.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.342
AND YOU THINK
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.170
ONCE A CONVICT,
ALWAYS A CONVICT?

15:54.214 --> 15:55.519
IS THAT IT?

15:55.563 --> 15:56.868
LOOK. YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.740
WE ALL HAVE.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.524
HATCH WAS A GOOD MAN.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.961
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'VE SEEN ANYTHING

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
OR HEARD ANYTHING.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.139
YEAH. I HEARD
SOMETHING.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.011
I HEARD YOU HAVE
BLOOD ALTERATION,

16:09.055 --> 16:10.534
MEANS YOU WERE NEVER
IN ANY DANGER

16:10.578 --> 16:12.972
GOING INTO
THAT REACTOR.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.799
RAVEN KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WAS DOING

16:14.843 --> 16:16.758
WHEN SHE SENT MY PEOPLE
DOWN THERE TO DIE.

16:18.238 --> 16:21.110
I THINK MAYBE SHE
SHOULD DIE FOR THAT.

16:21.154 --> 16:25.419
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU'RE THE MAN NOW.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.203
SOUND LIKE
JUSTICE TO YOU?

16:27.247 --> 16:29.423
YOU DIDN'T ASK
WHAT WAS STOLEN.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.468
SEEMS LIKE
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION

16:31.512 --> 16:32.992
UNLESS YOU
ALREADY KNOW.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
WHERE ARE THE GUNS?

16:38.693 --> 16:41.261
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.658
MY HUSBAND BACK.

16:54.056 --> 16:57.755
TELL RAVEN I SAID,
"BANG, BANG."

17:00.323 --> 17:01.977
HMM.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.458
YOU THOUGHT DYOZA
WAS A HANDFUL.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.178
HEY! YOU!

17:29.222 --> 17:30.440
THAT'S 3.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.702
UH! AGH!

17:31.746 --> 17:33.617
UHH! UH!

17:33.661 --> 17:35.967
UH! HUH! AH! UH!

17:36.011 --> 17:37.752
UGH! SOUND
THE ALARM.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.102
UH! UH! UH!

17:40.146 --> 17:42.452
UH! AAGH!

17:42.496 --> 17:45.151
LET'S CALL THAT
3 INSTEAD.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.848
AGH...

17:52.941 --> 17:54.464
MOM?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.425
OCTAVIA: DYOZA.

18:03.604 --> 18:06.955
OH, MY GOD, HOPE.

18:06.998 --> 18:10.176
OH, GOD. OH...

18:10.219 --> 18:11.916
OH...

18:17.879 --> 18:19.533
STONE ROOM'S THIS WAY.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.409
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

18:29.804 --> 18:32.067
BELLAMY'S DEAD.

18:35.201 --> 18:38.465
COME HERE.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.963
AH, YES,

18:59.007 --> 19:01.357
MORE STIMULATING
CONVERSATION.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.099
WHAT SHOULD WE TALK
ABOUT THIS TIME?

19:05.709 --> 19:07.407
OH.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.452
YOU GOT 5 MINUTES.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.411
HMM.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.240
PENN: PLEASE
SHUT HIM UP.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.124
THEY SEARCHED ME
FOR WEAPONS...

19:33.041 --> 19:35.739
JUST NOT VERY WELL,
MAYBE BECAUSE

19:35.783 --> 19:38.002
THEY THINK
I'M SATISFIED

19:38.046 --> 19:41.223
YOU CAN'T RESURRECT.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.226
I'M NOT SATISFIED.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.229
WHAT I DO NOW
I DO FOR THE PEOPLE

19:47.273 --> 19:50.493
OF SANCTUM WHOSE LIVES
YOU HAVE TAKEN

19:50.537 --> 19:54.758
TO EXTEND YOUR OWN,

19:54.802 --> 19:58.284
FOR THEIR FAMILIES
YOU LIED TO,

19:58.327 --> 20:03.724
AND FOR EVERY NULL
LEFT OUT TO DIE,

20:03.767 --> 20:06.901
MYSELF INCLUDED.

20:08.555 --> 20:12.123
HUH! UH! UHH!

20:12.167 --> 20:13.951
RRGH...RRGH...

20:13.995 --> 20:15.997
NOW THAT THAT'S
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM...

20:18.260 --> 20:20.610
HUH! RRGH! UH!

20:20.654 --> 20:22.177
UHH!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.919
UH...

20:27.313 --> 20:29.010
YOU'RE TOO
AGGRESSIVE.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.272
UH!

20:32.274 --> 20:35.625
HUH...YAH! UH! UGH!

20:35.669 --> 20:37.323
OHH!

20:37.366 --> 20:38.715
UGH...

20:38.759 --> 20:39.977
UGH...GUH...

20:40.021 --> 20:42.241
AAGH!

20:42.284 --> 20:44.721
I'LL TAKE THAT,
THANK YOU.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.382
DON'T BE ASHAMED.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.428
UH...

21:01.260 --> 21:04.132
UH...RRGH!

21:04.175 --> 21:06.743
IF RUSSELL WAS HERE,
I HAVE NO DOUBT

21:06.787 --> 21:09.311
YOU WOULD HAVE
KILLED HIM.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.271
DO YOU PLAY?

21:16.100 --> 21:19.800
YOU FOOL,
I'M NOT RUSSELL.

21:19.843 --> 21:22.193
DO YOU PLAY OR NOT?

21:23.456 --> 21:26.676
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.461
DON'T TELL ME GABRIEL
NEGLECTED TO TEACH

21:28.504 --> 21:30.027
HIS CHILDREN HOW
MIND DRIVES WORK

21:30.071 --> 21:31.812
BECAUSE I'D RATHER NOT
WASTE OUR PRECIOUS TIME.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.553
HE DID.
OF COURSE HE DID.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.642
THEN YOU KNOW TWO MINDS
CAN'T SHARE A BODY.

21:35.685 --> 21:40.560
I KILLED HIS MIND.
NOW HIS BODY'S MINE.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.911
SIT.
I'LL TEACH YOU.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.306
WHO ARE YOU?

21:47.349 --> 21:49.264
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
HOW TO GIVE YOU

21:49.308 --> 21:51.440
WHAT YOU WANT.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.964
AND WHAT IS THAT?

21:54.008 --> 21:57.707
WHAT EVERYONE
WANTS--POWER.

21:57.751 --> 22:01.842
I DON'T WANT POWER.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.018
I WANT JUSTICE.

22:06.281 --> 22:10.067
YOU CAN'T GET JUSTICE
WITHOUT POWER.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.505
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

22:12.548 --> 22:14.898
WONKRU IS WEAK.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.639
THEY HAVE NO LEADER,

22:16.683 --> 22:18.293
AND THEIR GUNS WERE
STOLEN LAST NIGHT.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.515
MY GUESS, IT WAS
THE ELIGIUS PRISONERS.

22:22.558 --> 22:26.823
YOU AND THE PRISONERS
SHARE AN ENEMY,

22:26.867 --> 22:29.391
PERHAPS EVEN
THE SAME GOAL.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.262
SOMEHOW I DOUBT
A BUNCH OF MURDERERS

22:31.306 --> 22:33.613
AND THIEVES
WANT JUSTICE.

22:33.656 --> 22:37.747
DON'T MAKE ME
REPEAT MYSELF.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.418
POWER.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.421
THEY WANT POWER.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.815
- OH...
- OK.

23:01.858 --> 23:05.427
YOU HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.778
HOW DO WE DO IT?

23:08.822 --> 23:10.824
YOU MAKE ALLIES

23:10.867 --> 23:13.392
OF THE MURDERERS
AND THE THIEVES.

23:14.697 --> 23:20.311
THEN YOU TAKE OUT
THE ENEMY'S QUEEN.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.587
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.154
KEEP MOVING.
WHERE'S THAT STONE, RAVEN?

23:37.198 --> 23:39.940
40 METERS
DEAD AHEAD.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.907
NO. IT'S A DEAD END,
AND THERE'S NO WAY AROUND.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.996
CLARKE: OK.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.737
WE BACKTRACK,
FIND ANOTHER WAY.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.872
UH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.404
I HATE THIS PLACE.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.667
IT'S JUST SEISMIC
ACTIVITY. LET'S--

24:15.279 --> 24:16.585
WHERE'D THEY GO?

24:16.629 --> 24:20.371
- CLARKE! WHERE'D THEY GO?
- RAVEN?

24:20.415 --> 24:22.504
- RAVEN!
- CLARKE!

24:25.812 --> 24:27.509
THE WALL
JUST MOVED.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.906
QUICK, HELP ME
PUSH IT. UH!

24:32.949 --> 24:34.560
THE SHIFTING
GROUND MOVED IT.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.257
MAYBE WE CAN
MOVE IT BACK.

24:36.300 --> 24:40.304
IT'S NOT SHIFTING GROUND.
CLARKE, THIS ISN'T A CAVE.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.524
IT'S A LIVING
ORGANISM.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.528
OH! UH!

24:46.572 --> 24:48.878
IF I'M RIGHT,

24:48.922 --> 24:53.666
THAT'S DIGESTIVE
ENZYME, MEANING--

24:53.709 --> 24:56.495
WE'RE ITS
NEXT MEAL.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.329
GABRIEL: THERE IT IS.
THAT'S THE STONE ROOM.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.810
- THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
- IT'S TOO QUIET.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.508
DYOZA:
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.987
THE STONES ARE
OUR ONLY WAY OUT.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.120
THEY'D KNOW
WE WERE COMING HERE.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.078
GOOD. WE'LL
TAKE RIGHT.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.689
YOU GO LEFT.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.387
GABRIEL: WE GO ON 3.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.259
1...

25:22.303 --> 25:23.652
2...

25:23.696 --> 25:25.480
WAIT.

25:27.003 --> 25:30.093
HOPE: IT'S LEVITT.
LET HER GO.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.883
A DOZEN DISCIPLES.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.319
THEY'LL SUICIDE TO STOP
YOU IF THEY HAVE TO.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.842
WELL, HOW DO WE
GET TO SANCTUM?

25:39.886 --> 25:42.628
YOU DON'T. GO THROUGH
THE OXYGEN FARM.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.238
THERE'S A DOOR
ON THE FAR SIDE,

25:44.281 --> 25:45.544
STAIRS THAT'LL TAKE
YOU TO THE SURFACE.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.154
- THEY WON'T FOLLOW.
- WHY?

25:47.197 --> 25:48.721
BECAUSE IT'S
NOT SURVIVABLE,

25:48.764 --> 25:52.463
NOT FOR LONG, ANYWAY,
LONGER THAN HERE.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.117
YOU'RE A JANITOR?

25:54.161 --> 25:56.946
HEH. YEAH...

25:56.990 --> 25:59.296
STILL ON THE CODE-
BREAKING TEAM, THOUGH.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.081
- THEY NEED ME FOR THAT.
- OF COURSE.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.431
IT WAS WORTH IT

26:03.474 --> 26:05.520
TO SEE ANOTHER
WAY TO LIVE,

26:05.564 --> 26:08.218
TO FEEL WHAT
YOU MADE ME FEEL.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.572
NOW PUNCH ME
AGAIN AND RUN.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.232
UH! UH...

26:22.276 --> 26:25.584
GUYS, WE RUN.

26:30.937 --> 26:33.287
ECHO: GABRIEL!

26:41.861 --> 26:44.385
BOY: COOL.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.256
WHAT IS THAT?

26:46.300 --> 26:48.824
IS THAT SOMETHING
FROM EARTH?

26:48.868 --> 26:52.480
YES. NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.485
CAN I SEE?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.799
YOU'RE WEIRD, HUH?

27:06.842 --> 27:08.931
BOY: HEY.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
YES. I'M A NULL
WHO WAS LEFT OUT

27:11.934 --> 27:13.370
TO DIE
IN THE WOODS.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.155
NO. I WOULD NOT
LIKE TO FIGHT YOU.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.026
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY,

27:17.070 --> 27:20.116
WE'RE GONNA PLAY SOCCER
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.118
OH. HA HA!

27:22.162 --> 27:24.338
MADI: SURE. WHY NOT?

27:24.381 --> 27:27.863
INDRA: MADI, I NEED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.996
WHAT, IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH CLARKE AND GAIA?

27:30.039 --> 27:32.215
NO. ALONE.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.612
FIND ME LATER.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.487
I'M SORRY, MADI.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.880
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.577
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:46.621 --> 27:50.059
I'M FAILING MY MISSION.
SANCTUM IS ON EDGE.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.974
YOU'VE SEEN
THE FIGHTING,

27:52.018 --> 27:53.933
THE ATTEMPT
ON RUSSELL'S LIFE.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.239
YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT,
A WOMAN SET HERSELF

27:56.283 --> 27:58.024
ON FIRE FOR HIM.

27:58.067 --> 28:01.331
THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT I FEAR COMES NEXT.

28:02.811 --> 28:06.554
OUR GUNS WERE STOLEN,
NEARLY 50 OF THEM,

28:06.597 --> 28:08.643
OVER 2,000 ROUNDS.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.253
I HAVE A GOOD IDEA
WHO HAS THEM,

28:10.297 --> 28:11.515
BUT I CAN'T
GET THEM BACK

28:11.559 --> 28:15.171
UNLESS ALL OF WONKRU
IS WITH ME.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.610
MADI...

28:19.654 --> 28:22.222
WE NEED
OUR COMMANDER.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.008
I KNOW YOU
DON'T WANT THIS.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.880
I DON'T WANT
THIS FOR YOU,

28:27.923 --> 28:29.925
BUT THERE ARE FORCES
AT PLAY HERE

28:29.969 --> 28:32.928
THAT ARE GREATER
THAN OUR WANTS,

28:32.972 --> 28:35.888
RESPONSIBILITIES
WE MUST YIELD TO.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.848
WHAT ABOUT CLARKE?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.242
I'LL TALK WITH CLARKE,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

28:42.285 --> 28:45.593
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THIS
MORE THAN HER.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.595
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

28:47.638 --> 28:49.815
LOOKING FOR
HER FRIENDS.

28:49.858 --> 28:54.602
HER PEOPLE NEED HER
LIKE YOURS NEED YOU.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.973
WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.497
THE OTHERS
WILL FIND A WAY.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.458
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

29:24.501 --> 29:26.025
DO WHAT?

29:26.068 --> 29:28.767
STAY SO
DAMN STRONG.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.204
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

29:31.247 --> 29:33.032
CLARKE GRIFFIN
DOESN'T BREAK.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.556
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.384
REALLY?

29:37.427 --> 29:40.430
I KILLED 4 PEOPLE IN
THE NUCLEAR REACTOR...

29:43.825 --> 29:46.219
8 MORE LATER THAT NIGHT
FOR GOOD MEASURE,

29:46.262 --> 29:49.744
AND I FEEL LIKE
MY SOUL'S CRACKED OPEN.

29:51.354 --> 29:54.314
YOU JUST
HUM ALONG

29:54.357 --> 29:56.969
LIKE A FINELY
TUNED ENGINE.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.145
RAVEN--

29:59.188 --> 30:02.452
MAYBE
THIS IS KARMA

30:02.496 --> 30:05.368
FOR EVERYTHING
WE'VE DONE,

30:05.412 --> 30:08.197
ALL THE PEOPLE
WE'VE KILLED.

30:08.241 --> 30:11.722
HEY, THE PEOPLE
WE'VE KILLED

30:11.766 --> 30:14.856
WE'VE KILLED TO SAVE
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.728
THEY LOVED
PEOPLE, TOO.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.557
WHEN DOES IT END?

30:20.601 --> 30:23.169
IT DOESN'T END HERE.

30:23.212 --> 30:26.172
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN KARMA, RAVEN,

30:26.215 --> 30:29.828
AND IF WE HAVE A SOUL,
YOURS ISN'T CRACKED.

30:29.871 --> 30:33.832
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,
MAYBE THE BEST I KNOW.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.316
BEST YOU KNOW, HUH?

30:43.363 --> 30:46.061
THEN WHY DIDN'T
I GO IN?

30:48.847 --> 30:52.415
I COULD'VE WELDED
THOSE PIPES MYSELF,

30:52.459 --> 30:55.331
BUT INSTEAD, I SENT HATCH
AND HIS PEOPLE TO DIE.

30:57.029 --> 31:01.555
I COULD'VE WELDED
MYSELF, BUT I WAS--

31:01.598 --> 31:03.992
I WAS AFRAID.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.125
HEY, IT'S OK.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.431
I WAS SO AFRAID.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.259
OH, CLARKE, I'M SO--

31:17.353 --> 31:19.225
UH! UH!

31:19.268 --> 31:21.618
- UH!
- AGH! UH!

31:21.662 --> 31:24.012
THIS IS USELESS.
STOP!

31:24.056 --> 31:26.145
WE NEED TO THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.932
OK. IT'S COMING BACK.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.328
AAH!

31:37.591 --> 31:40.942
- OH! AH!
- UH! YAAH!

31:43.597 --> 31:47.209
MILLER: AH! UH! UH! WHOA!

31:52.127 --> 31:53.868
OH...

31:56.523 --> 31:59.569
OH...HEH. OK.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.615
TOLD YOU.

32:05.097 --> 32:08.796
MILLER: HOW ABOUT YOU FIND US
A PLANET WITH A BEACH?

32:08.839 --> 32:13.279
YEAH, PREFERABLY ONE
THAT DOESN'T EAT PEOPLE.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.239
I'M ON IT.

32:30.470 --> 32:31.645
KNIGHT: INDRA...

32:36.650 --> 32:38.521
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,

32:38.565 --> 32:40.349
BUT I'LL BE
RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

32:40.393 --> 32:43.004
INDRA, WE JUST HEARD
WONKRU IS GATHERING

32:43.048 --> 32:44.919
AT THE REQUEST
OF THE COMMANDER.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.138
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

32:46.181 --> 32:47.922
KEEPING HELL
FROM BREAKING LOOSE.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.445
NOW GO INSIDE.

32:49.489 --> 32:50.925
THE DELEGATION FROM
ARCADIA IS SMALL,

32:50.969 --> 32:52.405
BUT YOU'LL FIND THEM.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.624
YOU TWO AREN'T
WONKRU. PLEASE GO.

32:54.668 --> 32:57.192
NEITHER IS MADI.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.238
WHY DID YOU
BRING THEM?

32:59.281 --> 33:00.979
JACKSON: BECAUSE
THEY CARE ABOUT HER,

33:01.022 --> 33:02.676
AND SO DO I.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.026
I'M FINE.
I CAN DO THIS.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.898
INDRA, LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S TERRIFIED.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.381
MADI KOM LOUWODA
KIRON KRU,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.557
YOU WERE BORN
FOR THIS.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.864
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
I TOLD YOU TO SAY?

33:21.695 --> 33:24.785
INDRA: THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.445
JACKSON: INDRA--

33:32.488 --> 33:34.534
YOU SAY ONE MORE WORD
TO STOP THIS,

33:34.577 --> 33:37.406
AND I WILL CUT YOU DOWN,
I SWEAR IT.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.192
MADI: DON'T
FIGHT, PLEASE.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.020
DO IT.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.369
CUT ME DOWN BECAUSE
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

33:43.412 --> 33:46.024
I'M LETTING THIS KID
GO IN THERE.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.855
I'M SORRY.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.770
JACKSON: SHE'S HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK, INDRA.

33:53.814 --> 33:56.251
SHE CAN'T DO THIS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.602
MADI, WAIT!

34:00.908 --> 34:02.953
EMORI: INDRA,
WHAT IS IT?

34:02.997 --> 34:04.999
LET US HELP.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.133
SHEIDHEDA.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.614
WHAT?

34:11.658 --> 34:13.094
IN MADI?
BUT I THOUGHT--

34:13.138 --> 34:15.618
NOT IN MADI.
IN RUSSELL.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.707
WHEN WE REMOVED
THE FLAME FROM MADI,

34:17.751 --> 34:19.622
SHEIDHEDA'S
CONSCIOUSNESS

34:19.666 --> 34:21.450
DISAPPEARED
INTO THE COMPUTER.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.061
FROM THERE,
IT JUMPED

34:23.104 --> 34:26.673
- INTO THE MIND DRIVE.
- THE MIND DRIVE.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.849
SO KILL HIM.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.981
MURPHY: WE CAN'T.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.767
FANATICS THINK HE'S RUSSELL.
THEY'LL BURN IT ALL DOWN.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.554
OF COURSE, IF WE TELL THEM
HE ISN'T RUSSELL,

34:38.598 --> 34:39.947
THEY'LL STILL
BURN IT ALL DOWN.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.296
EITHER WAY,
THEIR GOD IS DEAD.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.863
WHICH WILL BE THE
LEAST OF OUR WORRIES

34:42.906 --> 34:45.474
BECAUSE IF
WE TELL THEM,

34:45.518 --> 34:48.738
WONKRU WILL KNOW
SHEIDHEDA IS BACK.

34:50.044 --> 34:51.654
YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'D FOLLOW HIM?

34:51.698 --> 34:53.613
SANGEDAKRU WOULD,

34:53.656 --> 34:55.136
AND EVENTUALLY, THE
OTHERS WOULD KNEEL.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.398
I'VE SEEN IT
BEFORE.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.747
THAT'S WHY
WE NEED MADI.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.576
NO. THAT IS WHY
WE NEED YOU.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.189
I MEAN, COME ON, INDRA.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.886
WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY
IN THAT BUNKER,

35:05.929 --> 35:07.670
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT TAKES A GENIUS

35:07.714 --> 35:09.324
TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS
REALLY RUNNING THINGS DOWN THERE

35:09.368 --> 35:13.023
WHILE OCTAVIA WAS
PAINTING HER FACE WITH BLOOD.

35:13.067 --> 35:16.549
BESIDES, WHO'S
BOSSIER THAN YOU?

35:17.854 --> 35:19.378
I'M A SOLDIER,
A WARRIOR.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.859
THAT'S MY ROLE,
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

35:22.903 --> 35:27.168
INDRA, THE FACT THAT
YOU DON'T WANT IT,

35:27.212 --> 35:30.606
IT'S WHY YOU
SHOULD DO IT.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.186
GET RID OF THIS.

35:50.844 --> 35:54.108
- CAN WE AT LEAST WATCH?
- NO.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.505
I'M GONNA WATCH.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.267
HWAH!

37:12.839 --> 37:15.102
AH!

38:33.572 --> 38:36.357
OCTAVIA: AH, THIS IS IT--
THE OXYGEN FARM.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.620
WOMAN, ON P.A.:
ATTENTION ALL GUARDS.

38:38.664 --> 38:42.232
PRISONERS LAST SEEN
ON LEVEL 12 BY THE WARD.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.886
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.627
JUST TELL US HOW
TO GET OUTSIDE.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.368
- TO THE SURFACE?
- YES.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.283
YOU CAN'T, NOT
WITHOUT REBREATHERS.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.503
WHAT HAPPENS
WITHOUT REBREATHERS?

38:51.546 --> 38:53.635
SAME THING AS HAPPENED
TO THE BARDOANS--

38:53.679 --> 38:57.596
EXTINCTION, ONLY
SLOWER, I EXPECT.

38:57.639 --> 39:01.600
LEVITT WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD US TO
DO THIS IF IT WASN'T SURVIVABLE.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.123
AGH!

39:03.166 --> 39:04.690
WOMAN, ON PA:
ATTENTION ALL GUARDS.

39:04.733 --> 39:07.388
PRISONERS LAST SEEN
ON LEVEL 12 BY THE WARD.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.042
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

39:09.085 --> 39:10.957
SHE SAID HIS NAME.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.699
WE STILL MIGHT NEED
LEVITT ON THE INSIDE.

39:13.742 --> 39:16.223
- ON ME.
- YOU JUST HEARD HIM.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.007
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.836
HE WANTS HIS ANSWERS.
THAT'S ALL HE'S EVER WANTED.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.272
NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I WANT TO LIVE.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.883
THEN I SUGGEST
STEPPING ASIDE.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.406
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
- NO. WAIT.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.842
WOMAN, ON PA:
ATTENTION ALL GUARDS.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.453
PRISONERS LAST SEEN
ON LEVEL 12...

39:28.496 --> 39:30.803
OCTAVIA: THEY'RE COMING.
I TRUST LEVITT. LET'S GO.

39:33.806 --> 39:34.981
MOVE!

39:35.024 --> 39:36.243
DYOZA: GABRIEL,
OPEN THE DOOR.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.505
I CAN'T LET YOU
RISK IT.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.551
GABRIEL, WHAT
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

39:39.594 --> 39:41.074
UH!

39:41.117 --> 39:43.076
UHH...

39:43.119 --> 39:44.469
HE'S WITH THEM.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.341
WEAPONS DISENGAGED.
I SURRENDER.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.995
UH!

39:49.038 --> 39:51.301
UH...

39:56.698 --> 39:59.962
RAVEN, ANY CHANGE?

40:00.006 --> 40:01.964
STILL WAITING.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.445
THAT THING DAMAGED THE HELMET.
THE MAP'S TOO BLURRY.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.273
SO THINK IT
INTO FOCUS.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.362
I'M TRYING. I CAN'T TELL
WHICH IS THE RIGHT SYMBOL.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.452
- I THINK YOU NEED TO PICK ONE.
- NO WAY, NOT AGAIN.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.280
NIYLAH'S RIGHT.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.847
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO A PLANET WHERE

40:14.890 --> 40:17.153
THEY FEED THEIR DEAD TO
SOME CAVE BEAST, ANYWAY.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.851
NIYLAH...

40:25.510 --> 40:28.513
LOOK FAMILIAR?

40:28.556 --> 40:31.472
THE SECOND DAWN.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.127
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
THERE'S PEOPLE HERE

40:34.170 --> 40:36.085
FROM THE BUNKER
IN POLIS?

40:36.129 --> 40:38.348
IT'S GOT TO BE
A COINCIDENCE, RIGHT?

40:39.785 --> 40:42.614
GUYS, FOCUS.
IT'S COMING BACK.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.572
IT'S MORE
THAN JUST ONE.

40:44.616 --> 40:45.834
RAVEN--

40:45.878 --> 40:47.619
I'M TRYING.
I CAN ALMOST SEE IT.

40:47.662 --> 40:52.232
THERE! I GOT IT.
GET READY.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.366
ENTERING THE CODE NOW.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.375
THERE!

41:06.638 --> 41:09.031
FASTER, RAVEN!

41:09.075 --> 41:11.817
- RAVEN, NOW!
- ALMOST THERE.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.912
CLARKE: LET'S GO.

41:19.955 --> 41:22.088
WEAPONS HOT.

41:22.131 --> 41:25.004
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WAITING
FOR US ON THE OTHER SIDE.
