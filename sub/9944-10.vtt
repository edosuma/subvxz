of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815

for grinding your axes...

without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.

you just arrange the fights.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.895
Fine.

Fine.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.490
Cellmate, actually. Mark.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.935
Didn't they teach you
to ring doorbell in jail?

03:46.020 --> 03:47.692
Sorry about the unsociable hour.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.852
I just got out a few weeks ago.
I was going to surprise Jamie boy, here,

03:50.940 --> 03:54.899
but financial constraints meant
I had to hitch and by the time

03:54.980 --> 03:58.859
I showed it was a bit late so jimmied
the door rather than wake you up.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.010
Hee-haw!

04:01.100 --> 04:03.056
Christ, I forgot about that!

04:03.140 --> 04:06.450
It's a running joke we had inside.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.976
Every time someone talked about
breaking in somewhere, we'd...!

04:10.060 --> 04:11.698
BOTH LAUGH

04:11.780 --> 04:15.375
- I guess you had to be there, eh?
- Guess you did.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.690
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

04:19.779 --> 04:22.340
Some of us need our beauty sleep.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.774
- We'll try and keep the noise down.
- Landed on your feet there, mate.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.772
- Yeah, life's pretty good.
- Sure.

04:32.420 --> 04:34.570
Could always be better though, eh?

04:38.900 --> 04:40.128
There you go, mate.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.176
- You cook this?
- Yeah.

04:42.260 --> 04:45.093
- He's good at it.
- I'm in the Twilight Zone.

04:45.180 --> 04:46.772
It's only bacon and eggs.

04:46.860 --> 04:51.217
A Maguire in gainful employment.
Now what's the real story here?

04:51.300 --> 04:54.292
This place? Got to be
a front for some kind of scam.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.654
It's a pub, that's all.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.528
Yeah... He tried jail once. Didn't suit him.

- Do you want ketchup?
- Cheers.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.015

Get an OK job with them results.
Factory or something.

06:03.700 --> 06:07.136
I don't want to work in a factory.
I want to be someone, you know?

06:07.220 --> 06:08.733
Not just another fuckin' loser.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.617
You've always got resits.

- Huh?!

06:20.060 --> 06:22.858
- It were an accident.
- Well, it better had have been!

06:22.940 --> 06:24.134
Go on, then!

06:24.220 --> 06:27.735
Do whatever it is you're going to do!
Stick one on my jaw, whatever!

06:27.820 --> 06:30.175
Sincerely doubt you could
take a punch from me!

06:35.580 --> 06:37.332
How much do you weigh?

06:37.420 --> 06:39.650
About 140 Ibs or so?

in here is in the ring.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.140

07:03.220 --> 07:04.448

07:04.540 --> 07:08.499
Well, there's you and then
there's the other guy, right?

07:08.580 --> 07:12.016
You have to hit him
harder than he hits you.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.660
Congratulations,
you've passed basic training.

07:14.740 --> 07:19.177
I know what it is, it's just...
I don't think I'd be any good at it.

07:19.260 --> 07:21.569
Some people are born into greatness,

07:21.660 --> 07:23.855
some have greatness thrust upon them.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.330
Others just run away fast as they can.
Nothing wrong with that.

07:27.420 --> 07:32.175

Hey, looks like we've got ourselves
a natural here, lads, eh?

08:14.900 --> 08:16.856
You've sort of ruined things for me.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.373
Sorry?

08:18.460 --> 08:21.975
When I got out, I was looking forward
to catching up with him...

08:22.060 --> 08:25.496
spending some time, you know... mates.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.014
Stay here as long as you want,
within reason.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.058
I like you Karen, but...
you can't change him.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.256
Sticking him in here,
responsible citizen and all that...

08:34.340 --> 08:36.296
doesn't change who he is.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.610
I think I know my own husband.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.859
I was there before
he even knew you existed...

08:44.940 --> 08:47.090
and I'll be there long after you've gone.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.298
We had plans
and you're not going to change that.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.856
Take your fucking hands off me.

08:55.940 --> 08:58.613
Fair warning, Karen, that's all.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.531
One day you'll thank me.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.372
Hand...

09:02.460 --> 09:03.654
now.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.973
Auntie Shaza!

09:16.060 --> 09:19.496
Hiya! You never said you were calling!

09:19.580 --> 09:20.376
I know.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.416
- Good to see you!
- You too.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.730
Norma, this is Shaza.
Shaza, Norma.

09:24.820 --> 09:27.209
- Hiya.
- You got any presents for me?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.052
Today I've got something for your mum.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.573
Flowers?

09:30.660 --> 09:34.972
I say, you're much more traditional
than I thought. Put us all to shame!

09:35.060 --> 09:36.413
What are you on about?

09:36.500 --> 09:38.730
Meena... getting married.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.492
Eh?!

09:41.380 --> 09:42.529
Say that again.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.929
I don't think I want to.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.774
An arranged marriage?
What the hell were you thinking?

09:48.860 --> 09:50.532
I'm 16, I can do what I want.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.736
Like fuck you can!

09:52.820 --> 09:55.254
Who is he? Who is he?

09:55.340 --> 09:58.013
His name's Shahid, all right?

09:59.260 --> 10:03.776
He's a doctor. Well, a medical student.

10:03.860 --> 10:07.455
Once he's finished his degree
at... Bahria University.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.893
Bahria? Where the fuck's that, then? >

10:13.980 --> 10:15.459
It's in Islamabad.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.132
Pakistan.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.814
- I don't believe this.
- His family have given <i>their</i> blessing...

10:19.900 --> 10:22.778
Not without speaking
to me first, they haven't!

10:22.860 --> 10:27.775
I've sort of already spoken to 'em.
I had to speak for you.

10:27.860 --> 10:31.409
There is no way in shittin' hell

10:31.500 --> 10:35.698
I'm letting you bugger off to Pakistan
for an arranged marriage!

10:35.780 --> 10:37.179
Gi' me their number.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.898
Auntie Shaza...

10:38.980 --> 10:39.935
Just give her the number.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.375
No, you can't make me.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.530
Yes, I fucking can!

10:54.820 --> 10:56.617
Same again, mate.

11:00.740 --> 11:04.050
It's weird...
You haven't mentioned it once.

11:04.140 --> 11:05.334
Mentioned what?

11:05.420 --> 11:08.218
What we discussed... inside.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.938
Things are different now.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.136
Yeah, but you and me...

11:12.220 --> 11:16.054
Smart. It's the opportunities,
the perfect crime.

11:16.140 --> 11:19.894
That was always the aim. We spent
enough time talking about it.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.734
Mark... It was just talk, yeah?

11:25.580 --> 11:29.334
I didn't want to have
to tell you this. You owe me.

11:29.420 --> 11:32.093
Yeah. I know I do.

11:32.180 --> 11:36.378
I know you've got a lot to lose...
but think of what you've got to gain.

11:36.460 --> 11:40.453
You gonna spend the rest of your life
pulling pints in some shitty pub?

11:40.540 --> 11:43.498
Think that's a life for you? For Karen?

11:43.580 --> 11:46.617
This shitty pub is our home!

11:46.700 --> 11:49.578
I'm just trying to help him out.
What kind of mate wouldn't do that?

11:49.660 --> 11:51.571
I don't know.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.858
Maybe the sort of mate who grabs
his wife when his back's turned!

11:55.940 --> 11:57.737
What are you trying to say?
I tried to touch you up?!

11:57.820 --> 12:00.618
- Mark!
- I'd never do that, I swear!

12:05.740 --> 12:06.695
He put his hand on my arm.

12:06.780 --> 12:09.214
We were just having a chat.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.733
What else did he do?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.689
Well, nothing, but that's not the point...

12:15.780 --> 12:18.533
It sounds like a misunderstanding, yeah?

12:20.460 --> 12:25.250
I'm sorry Karen, if, er... I invaded
your personal space or whatever.

12:25.340 --> 12:28.377
But it wasn't intentional. I'm sorry.

12:41.740 --> 12:42.934
Hey.

12:51.420 --> 12:54.378
There's something you should know
about me and Mark.

12:54.460 --> 13:00.615
When I first went to jail, a lot of people
recognised the name, you know?

13:00.700 --> 13:01.894
The Maguire curse.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.289
Nothing I couldn't handle
on a one-to-one basis,

13:04.380 --> 13:06.735
but then there was a bunch of 'em.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.618
MEN SHOUTING

13:12.300 --> 13:14.131
Mark waded in with a lead pipe,

13:14.220 --> 13:16.780
cracked some skulls, got me out of there.

13:16.860 --> 13:20.136
If he hadn't,
they wouldn't have stopped, Karen.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.938
I wouldn't be here.

13:22.020 --> 13:25.012
I wouldn't have met you, nothing.

13:32.980 --> 13:37.576
Mark got another year added on
to his sentence because of that.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.495
I owe him, Karen.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.889
What about us?

13:45.980 --> 13:49.052
Jesus, you go on about the Maguire curse.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.171
We're meant to be beyond all that.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.376
You and me.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.293
This isn't gonna be
another fuckin' Maguire marriage

13:57.380 --> 13:59.336
where the woman spends
half the night

13:59.420 --> 14:01.536
waiting up for a knock on the door
from the police or whatever.

14:01.620 --> 14:02.735
I know. I know.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.697
You've got a choice.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.691
You don't get it, do you?

14:06.780 --> 14:10.011
There's no choice.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.660
It's you every time, no questions.

14:12.740 --> 14:14.776
Then you'll ask him to go.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.259
Karen, please.

14:16.340 --> 14:19.013
"There's no choice," you said.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.095
SHE IMITATES LIGHTSABER
Luke!

14:48.500 --> 14:49.649
Jesus!

14:49.740 --> 14:52.698
Sorry, er... I was just...

14:52.780 --> 14:54.532
Fighting the forces of evil?

14:54.620 --> 14:57.532
Aye, yeah, well, it passes the time.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.099
Yvonne sent me to get some groceries.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.579
Oh, aye - help yourself!

15:00.660 --> 15:05.017
Cheers. Hey, don't mind me,
you know, if you want to get on...

15:05.100 --> 15:07.773
Aye, no, I'm all right. Thanks.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.373
Oh.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.569
You've not even opened your exam results.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.254
And already,
you're pissing your future away.

15:40.260 --> 15:43.696
- Well?
- One A, one C and the rest Bs.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.611
You've got real prospects there.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.099
GCSEs mean nothing.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.058
I don't want to end up
like everyone else round here,

15:50.140 --> 15:52.131
slaving away in shitty jobs.

15:52.220 --> 15:53.369
Like me, you mean?

15:53.460 --> 15:55.098
Yeah, like you.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.012
OK.

quite fit - in both ways.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.573
Yeah.

16:24.660 --> 16:29.131
Maybe it were a fluke. I mean,
one lucky punch and I think I'm Tyson.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.335
< Ah, nonsense!

16:30.420 --> 16:33.571
Do you know what's the greatest
weapon a boxer can have?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.979
Big hands?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.331
Knowing your strengths.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.456
And I don't just mean physical.

16:40.540 --> 16:41.768
Mental, too.

16:41.860 --> 16:44.374
Visualise the win.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.371
That's half the battle.

16:46.460 --> 16:50.738
You're gonna win today, Carl,
and you're gonna keep on winning.

16:50.820 --> 16:53.778
Trust me. Before you know it,
you're gonna be fighting

16:53.860 --> 16:58.012

in this job then?

18:16.700 --> 18:18.179
Sorry.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.854
Fuckin' hell.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.215
You have changed.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.019
The old Jamie would have
at least asked the details,

18:26.100 --> 18:27.579
got a bit interested.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.412
No, forget it.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.968
I know the score. Everyone's fuckin' sorry.

18:33.060 --> 18:37.497
Listen, do us a favour and call at one
of those cash places on the way.

18:37.580 --> 18:40.378
Mum bunged me a cheque
for me birthday.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.132
Sorry, man. I didn't realise.
Happy birthday.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.654
No big deal.
It's only ten fuckin' quid.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.173
Cheers, mother.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.449
Hiya.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.858
Not battling the Dark Side
this afternoon then?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.214
Do you fancy a drink later?

19:06.220 --> 19:07.448
What, is this a joke?

19:07.540 --> 19:08.893
No.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.732
Yvonne or someone trying to be funny.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.936
No. Just me asking you out for a drink.

19:13.020 --> 19:15.488
Huh! You're not a lesbian.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.571
I am.

19:17.660 --> 19:18.979
Man, no you're not.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.130
Jesus, it wasn't meant to be a big deal.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.654
If you just say yes or no,
I can piss off and plan me evening.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.014
Yes.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.056
Good. Thanks.

19:27.140 --> 19:29.449
See you later, then. Jockey, at eight?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.259

- We've got to go.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.255
Stupid bastard. I told you,
I don't do that shit any more.

It's all right.
Didn't want to bother you.

I'm going on a date tonight.

No, no. I am.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.533
Oh. Sorry.

20:48.620 --> 20:52.659
It's just a bit hard,
trying to imagine <i>you</i> on a date.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.856
Are you not bothered, then?

20:54.940 --> 20:56.532
Why would I be bothered?

20:56.620 --> 20:59.009
No, go on out. Have some fun.

20:59.100 --> 21:03.139
Only, don't do that thing where you
talk about yourself all the time

21:03.220 --> 21:05.051
cos it can be really tiresome.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.937
You know, it wouldn't kill you

What, actually, you've been out with
properly or just dated?

21:37.300 --> 21:38.733
Proper ones.

21:38.820 --> 21:41.095
Erm, a couple of months or more at least.

21:41.180 --> 21:43.216
Mmm, three.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.018
No, four.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.777
BOTH LAUGH

22:04.860 --> 22:08.694
Aye, there was someone.
I split up with 'em, though.

22:08.780 --> 22:12.056
They got a bit clingy.
They couldn't move on.

22:12.140 --> 22:13.732
What happened?

22:13.820 --> 22:15.219
They died.

Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

Oh, no, it was a good death.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.329
A good death being?

22:27.900 --> 22:29.618
Better not to talk about it.

22:29.700 --> 22:34.490
You know, the last thing you want
is me talking about meself.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.933

Yeah, thanks.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.814
So, how's it going?

22:52.900 --> 22:55.130
Oh, don't act like you give a toss, eh?

22:56.700 --> 22:58.930
It's all right, I'm just going to the loo.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.574
I thought you weren't gonna let
domestics get in the way of work.

23:05.660 --> 23:09.699
Yeah. It's not easy being married
to a Maguire. Or being one of 'em.

23:09.780 --> 23:13.659
- You're not one of 'em.
- Yeah?

23:14.340 --> 23:16.808
< Killed anyone recently?

23:16.900 --> 23:17.935
No.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.051
Broken anyone's legs?

23:22.140 --> 23:23.209
No.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.291
So I'm guessing you haven't tied
anyone to the back of your car

23:25.380 --> 23:26.608

23:26.700 --> 23:28.258

Paddy. Last week - paperboy.

Nice night?

23:44.540 --> 23:46.735
Yeah, so far.

24:05.780 --> 24:07.133
That was weird.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.016
What was?

24:08.100 --> 24:10.250
That woman over there

24:10.340 --> 24:13.412
just had a word with me about you
in the toilets.

24:13.500 --> 24:18.210
Oh, fuck. Look, whatever she said,
right, about us...

24:18.300 --> 24:21.531
She's on medication.
She's proper loopy, like.

24:21.620 --> 24:26.171
No, she didn't say anything bad about you.
Quite the opposite. Very over-protective.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.012
Oh.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.858

24:34.940 --> 24:36.293

Yeah. Rockin'.

24:38.860 --> 24:41.818

24:48.660 --> 24:50.252

24:50.340 --> 24:51.819
You don't have to do that.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.334
- Here.
- What's that?

24:57.420 --> 24:59.536
For your vaccinations for Pakistan.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.815
Hepatitis A and Typhoid.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.731
Have you sorted your spends out?

25:03.820 --> 25:05.333
Well, no.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.059
I suppose your husband'll
sort that out, won't he?

25:08.140 --> 25:09.289
Yeah.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.575
Mum, I need my footy strip
for tomorrow.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.332
Washed and ironed, on your bed.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.809
And you'd best play good -
I'll be watching.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.336
Don't shout abuse from the touchline again -
it's embarrassing.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.251
Mum?

25:21.340 --> 25:24.855
How do I go about getting the jabs
sorted and that?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.771
You're an adult.
I'm sure you can work it out for yourself.

25:26.860 --> 25:30.250
- Yeah, but...
- Oh, my God! It's on the bed!

25:39.700 --> 25:41.133
This is beyond a joke.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.699

26:17.740 --> 26:19.970
Oh, well you did, but...

26:20.060 --> 26:22.096
in a good way, cos now I know...

26:22.180 --> 26:24.136
I know you care.

26:24.220 --> 26:25.938
Course I do.

26:26.020 --> 26:29.695
That's why I left early.
To come and see you.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.897
Oh, Norma!

26:32.980 --> 26:38.498
No, no. This means
we've got a chance, doesn't it?

26:38.580 --> 26:41.572
I don't want to be with you.

26:42.820 --> 26:46.449
I know you... I know
you can't walk out on the kids again,

26:46.540 --> 26:50.419
- but...
- No. No buts. Nothing.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.856
Not today, not tomorrow.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.419
Not ever.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.128
Why don't you just say it for once?

27:01.220 --> 27:05.008
That you know that there
is never gonna be a me and you.

27:08.620 --> 27:09.973
I can't.

27:11.460 --> 27:15.248
Oh, Norma.
For heaven's sake, look at you.

27:15.340 --> 27:20.050
You're living outside my window.
For what? For this?

27:21.780 --> 27:24.169
Are you really that desperate?

27:25.260 --> 27:26.579
No...

27:29.260 --> 27:31.899
You're all I've got.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.896
Then you haven't got anything.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.056
Say it.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.572
There's never gonna be...

27:54.660 --> 27:56.491
a me and you.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.488
And there you go.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.093
DOOR SLAMS

28:12.300 --> 28:13.938
KNOCK ON DOOR

28:14.020 --> 28:15.419
I bet that's him, now.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.060
Puppy dog expression and flowers
from a service station.

28:18.140 --> 28:19.971
Better fuckin' had be.

28:23.220 --> 28:24.892
What time do you call this?

28:26.820 --> 28:29.175
Sorry, Paddy.
I thought you were Jamie.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.694
Karen...

28:31.780 --> 28:33.293
That's why I'm here.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.012
Where is he, Mimi?

28:40.100 --> 28:42.694
It's OK, love, he's here.

28:42.780 --> 28:47.092
It's all right.
He'll be all right. Come on.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.136
Be strong for him.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.293
Go on, love.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.295
Jamie?

28:58.380 --> 29:00.257
Hey.

29:03.540 --> 29:04.973
HE GROANS

29:07.740 --> 29:09.890
What happened?

29:09.980 --> 29:12.130
Fucking Mark.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.857
Decided to pull a robbery.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.454
Honestly, Karen, I didn't know.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.013
But we were on the bike,
and next thing I knew...

29:26.620 --> 29:29.771
...going too fast. Lost control.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.498
What were you thinking?

29:32.580 --> 29:34.730
He stuck a gun on me.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.617
I was so fucking stupid for trusting him.

29:43.660 --> 29:44.615
If this goes to court...

29:44.700 --> 29:46.133
Yeah, I know.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.930
I could be looking at ten years.

29:52.980 --> 29:56.017
- Ten fucking years, Karen.
- Don't say that, please.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.695
If that does happen, don't...

30:01.420 --> 30:02.853
Don't wait for me.

30:06.980 --> 30:10.689
You don't deserve that. You don't deserve

30:10.780 --> 30:13.817
to be another Maguire woman,
visiting prison every week.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.289
I won't let that happen.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.292
You might not have a choice, Karen.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.459
PHONE BEEPS

31:33.060 --> 31:34.379
- On guard!
- Argh!

31:34.460 --> 31:35.939
Shit, sorry!

31:36.020 --> 31:37.612
What the fuck did you do that for?

31:37.700 --> 31:40.851
Well, you know, I was just trying to help...

31:40.940 --> 31:45.252
Getting the old reflexes greased.
Big day today, eh?

31:45.340 --> 31:46.489
That fuckin' hurt!

31:46.580 --> 31:49.538
Well, you know, you've got
to be ready at any time, son.

31:49.620 --> 31:52.373
You know, coiled like a tiger,
prepared to pounce.

31:52.460 --> 31:55.770
- You show a left, a right!
- Argh! Jesus!

31:55.860 --> 31:58.852
Now, that wasn't my fault!
You just walked onto that!

31:58.940 --> 31:59.929
Stop hitting me, OK?

32:00.020 --> 32:02.170
I'm not hitting you!

32:02.260 --> 32:03.534
Helping.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.417
Well, cheers(!)

32:05.500 --> 32:10.733
Hey! No self pleasure, son.
Keep the juice firmly in the tank.

32:12.540 --> 32:14.292
< Karen...

32:16.740 --> 32:17.889
< Karen!

32:17.980 --> 32:19.015
What?!

32:19.100 --> 32:21.489
I said, is it OK for me to take an hour off?

32:21.580 --> 32:24.014
It is Carl's big fight tonight,
and all that.

32:24.100 --> 32:28.537
Yeah. Actually, just take the day off
and come back for the evening shift.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.690
Thanks.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.213
Cheers.

32:35.580 --> 32:36.569
Karen...

32:36.660 --> 32:38.332
I'm fine.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.977
Shaza?
Shaza, I just wanted to say,

32:56.060 --> 32:58.654
I'm sorry about last night.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.412
No, no, it's fine.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.933
What, really?

33:04.020 --> 33:06.853
Yeah. Nothing I like better
than someone buggering off

33:06.940 --> 33:09.773
halfway through the night
the moment my back's turned(!)

33:09.860 --> 33:14.376
There was something I had to do.
And, well, um...

33:15.500 --> 33:19.652
...I'm gonna be in The Jockey later.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.810
I'm busy, Norma.

33:35.740 --> 33:39.096
Right... Let's get this over with.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.252
First round, you come out,
throw a couple, looking good.

33:42.340 --> 33:45.093
Then, about a minute in,
no sooner, you let him tag you,

33:45.180 --> 33:47.614
- and thud, drop like a stone.
- What?!

33:47.700 --> 33:49.372
First round, remember?

33:49.460 --> 33:51.291
Wait...

33:51.380 --> 33:52.733
You want me to take a dive?

33:52.820 --> 33:56.176
Christ Almighty, you didn't actually
think you had a chance?!

33:56.260 --> 33:59.570
- I've been doing really well.
- Three fights, three KOs!

33:59.660 --> 34:02.811
Of course you've done well.
All those fellas you knocked out,

34:02.900 --> 34:07.178
they were under my orders.
You can't bet on proper fights any more.

34:07.260 --> 34:10.696
Corruption's ruined the sport.
So we lay wagers on the juniors.

34:10.780 --> 34:14.819
With your great performances, the odds on
you going down in the first round are tasty.

34:14.900 --> 34:15.855
You used me.

34:15.940 --> 34:18.500
Ah! Don't be a baby about it.

34:19.580 --> 34:24.016
You're getting a 5% slice of the winnings.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.853
So you'd better make it look convincing.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.418
All right?

34:28.500 --> 34:29.899
PADD Y SLAPS CARL'S BACK

34:36.940 --> 34:39.170
You never know.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.773
You might get lucky.

34:40.860 --> 34:44.534
The other fighter might injure himself
climbing into the ring.

34:44.620 --> 34:47.339
Or I might knock him out.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.739
Yeah.

34:50.380 --> 34:56.250
I mean, if I really work hard at it,
for once, a proper go for it.

34:56.340 --> 35:00.856
This is my chance! Go out there,
show Paddy, show 'em all,

35:00.940 --> 35:04.376
that the Chatsworth Pounder
doesn't go down.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.334
"The Chatsworth Pounder"?!

35:08.420 --> 35:10.297
Don't you like it?

35:10.380 --> 35:12.575
You sound like a gay porn star.

35:12.660 --> 35:14.696
Ask me if I'm ready.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.293
Are you ready?

35:16.380 --> 35:18.610
I were born ready.

CHEERING

36:16.660 --> 36:20.972
You've gotta stop her. She's already
measuring my room for new wallpaper.

36:21.060 --> 36:22.493
She's gonna get a lodger.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.415
Shouldn't bother you.
It won't be your room any more.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.253
Yeah, but I'll need somewhere
to stay if I come back.

36:34.340 --> 36:39.130
It's Islamabad, not Bolton.
You can't just nip home... Thanks.

36:39.220 --> 36:41.290
Maybe I should stay a bit longer.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.336
It's an arranged marriage, Meena.

36:43.420 --> 36:46.651
You can't just back out of it
when you feel like it.

36:46.740 --> 36:48.890
I could help you, though.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.494
Auntie Shaza, please.

36:51.580 --> 36:55.050
I just need a bit more time.
Not for me, for me mum.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.971
I'm worried about her.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.893
Oh, right. Not cos you've got cold feet?

36:59.980 --> 37:02.289
No.

37:02.380 --> 37:05.736
A lot of hassle for me. And your mum.

37:05.820 --> 37:09.893
Family reputation.
You could help there, though.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.335
Anything.

37:12.420 --> 37:15.935
Your A-Levels. You sit them properly.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.136
It's good for the family, Meena.

37:18.220 --> 37:21.371
You know, smart daughter.
Something to show off about.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.974
No, of course.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.810
Thank you.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.415
Risky, that.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.933
Worked, though.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.339
Well, yeah.

37:39.980 --> 37:44.098
One day, I hope to fuck somebody
can explain to me how I managed to raise

37:44.180 --> 37:46.375
such an ungrateful little cow of a daughter.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.052
Yeah.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.290
She loves you, too.

38:03.300 --> 38:04.255
Hiya.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.138
Hey. Is Jamie around?

38:07.220 --> 38:08.892
He's in hospital.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.210
What?! I thought he said to come here.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.291
That wasn't him. That was me.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.575
(Fuck!)

38:15.660 --> 38:18.254
Has he said anything, about me?

38:19.500 --> 38:21.616
He is a mate, isn't he?

38:21.700 --> 38:24.339
Mates don't shove
each other into the shit.

38:25.980 --> 38:28.414
It doesn't have to be that way, though.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.209
I can't go to the police.
I just got out. They'll crucify me!

38:33.260 --> 38:35.455
Ten years he's looking at because of you.

38:37.260 --> 38:39.615
And I don't know what
he feels worse about -

38:39.700 --> 38:45.616
that, or the fact that somebody
he trusted did this to him.

38:48.300 --> 38:51.258
Help him... please.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.897
It's not too late.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.132
HE SIGHS

39:01.140 --> 39:02.937
Sorry.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.696
Yeah...

39:09.700 --> 39:12.168
I'm sorry too.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.098
Tell them our Jamie
had nothing to do with it.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.897
You all right?

40:18.020 --> 40:20.773
Give it five minutes
until you come down, OK?

40:45.060 --> 40:46.493
Jay.

40:52.500 --> 40:59.212
Stan says they're dropping all the charges.
Mark's confessed.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.655
Even admitting pulling a gun on you.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.019
You're in the clear.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.056
Guess I am, yeah.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.011
Thanks.

Agh! Bell end! >

41:39.340 --> 41:43.333
Remind me never to
trust anyone again, yeah?

41:43.420 --> 41:44.694
Came through for you, though.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.052
Yeah.

41:48.140 --> 41:49.573
He did.

41:55.300 --> 41:59.134
And you. Are you OK?

41:59.220 --> 42:01.176
Just glad to have you back.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.376
That's not what I meant.

42:05.380 --> 42:06.335
I'm fine.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.253
Karen, whatever it is you did...

42:09.340 --> 42:11.092
I didn't do anything.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.531
Just tell me.

42:14.620 --> 42:16.053
Really.

42:18.780 --> 42:19.735
Are you OK?

42:25.300 --> 42:27.052
I married you, didn't I?

42:29.260 --> 42:32.536
Makes me a Maguire whether I like it or not.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.174
First round, I said. Not first fucking punch.

42:40.260 --> 42:42.137
Do you know how suspicious
that looked?

42:42.220 --> 42:44.290
Fucking idiot!

42:50.860 --> 42:52.054
What are you so happy about?

42:52.140 --> 42:53.095
I got paid.

42:53.180 --> 42:56.695
What about your self-respect?
All that stuff?

42:56.780 --> 43:00.693
Fuck that! I got paid. And I can pay
some losers to resit me exams for me.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.658
There's no harm in taking
the money and running.

43:03.740 --> 43:08.370
That's what made this nation great,
cowardice and greed.

43:08.460 --> 43:10.849
Couldn't sub us a tenner, could you?

43:12.140 --> 43:14.415
