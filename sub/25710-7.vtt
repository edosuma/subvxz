00:31.100 --> 00:32.820
This must be the front
for their drugs ring.

00:34.820 --> 00:35.700
Bingo!

00:35.780 --> 00:37.620
Gambling on a government computer,
Chris?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.580
- No! I...
- I was joking.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.380
You said "bingo." I made a joke.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.940
- Oh, right.
- You're authorized to laugh.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.580
I was joking again. What <i>are</i> you doing?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.820
Er, just, er, usual police business.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.980
Oh, yeah, big old spike
in prescription drugs

00:54.060 --> 00:55.300
on the black market.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.620
Now the bastards are selling placebos too,

00:57.700 --> 01:00.740
so the poor sods buying
knock-off pills don't even get cured.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.340
Scum of the earth.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.620
That's the point of Operation Thunderbolt.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.700
Anyway, it's good to see you
back on track.

01:07.420 --> 01:09.620
We need you, Chris. I need you.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.540
Top coppers are hard to come by and, er,

01:12.620 --> 01:13.780
you're one of them.

01:14.180 --> 01:15.380
Thank you, ma'am.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.900
DECEASED

01:28.980 --> 01:30.740
So, if Dr. Glennis is dead...

01:32.060 --> 01:33.060
MRS. GLENNIS. IS SHE INVOLVED?

01:34.660 --> 01:37.820
I'm just popping out... to get a bun.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.020
Anyone want one?

01:49.996 --> 01:54.996
Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:55.820 --> 01:57.420
I mustn't have locked it up properly.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.580
Well, it does sound like something
you'd do.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.540
I loved that bike.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.580
Trusty steed!

02:07.860 --> 02:09.820
<i>Must've been targeted by thieves.</i>

02:10.900 --> 02:13.700
<i>I did call the police, but they said
there was nothing they could do.</i>

02:15.020 --> 02:17.580
It's fine. We'll just get you another one.

02:18.580 --> 02:20.740
Luckily, it comes under
the contents insurance.

02:21.860 --> 02:22.940
Thank you, darling.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.220
I'm off out now.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.140
Don't forget to pay for
the club membership.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.740
- Oh, sorry.
- Hello, officer.

02:35.260 --> 02:38.620
I was sorry to hear about
your recent, um, loss.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.300
Right.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.020
Well, couldn't be helped.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.900
I see you're handling the news
rather well.

02:44.980 --> 02:48.100
Yes, well, we have insurance,
so no harm done.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.420
I see.

02:51.740 --> 02:54.380
Do you mind if I take a picture of you,
for my files?

02:56.060 --> 02:57.140
Well, I suppose so.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.380
Can I ask, did your husband
have any enemies?

03:06.460 --> 03:08.300
Do you think
there's something more to this?

03:08.380 --> 03:10.740
We're only just scratching the surface,
Mrs. Glennis.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.740
I had no idea the police
would take this so seriously.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.300
It is extremely serious.
More lives are at stake.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.740
Right.

03:18.420 --> 03:20.580
Well, good luck with your...

03:21.820 --> 03:23.180
investigation.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.620
Let's be honest for a moment, okay?

03:31.700 --> 03:33.620
He was not a nice man.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.780
He was blackmailing us. He was
on his way to blackmail Katerina West.

03:38.660 --> 03:39.740
He bit my hand.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.780
- What?
- Other hand.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.260
Ah, of course, yes. He bit my hand.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.460
Look, it was his own fault.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.220
He was trying to break into her property.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.900
He was a bit of a...

03:50.980 --> 03:53.140
He was a bit of a bloody loony,
if you ask me.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.540
I know I shouldn't say this,
because I am a doctor

03:55.620 --> 03:59.580
and I've taken the Hippocratic oath,
but part of me, a big part of me,

04:00.660 --> 04:02.060
is quite relieved he's dead.

04:02.940 --> 04:03.940
Yeah.

04:04.020 --> 04:07.780
Thank God that he died
before he got to her.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.260
Yes.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.340
Did you fake those scans?

04:11.420 --> 04:12.980
Ah, yes, I did. Let me show you.

04:13.660 --> 04:16.100
I, er, swapped them over
for a patient of mine

04:16.180 --> 04:18.820
who's got a smaller tumor
in their esophagus.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.660
Comme ça. It's there.

04:21.420 --> 04:24.380
- People are gonna buy this, right?
- Oh, yes, yes, of course.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.340
Look, see,
there's your name there on the top.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.780
Down here for dancing,

04:27.860 --> 04:29.140
up here

04:29.220 --> 04:31.140
for faking medical records.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.620
- You've spelt it wrong again.
- Oh, have I? I'll change it.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.740
I know I don't say this very often...

04:38.900 --> 04:40.860
or... ever...

04:42.020 --> 04:43.860
but... thanks.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.340
I think we're actually gonna...

04:46.980 --> 04:49.260
- actually gonna get through this.
- Yes.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.620
Yes, I think so too.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.820
As our American cousins might say, er...

04:55.700 --> 04:57.820
we all good, my man.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.340
And you haven't had any surgery?

05:03.820 --> 05:05.660
- Nope.
- Just chemotherapy?

05:06.100 --> 05:07.980
- Yeah.
- It's totally unbelievable.

05:08.820 --> 05:10.460
Oh. Really?

05:10.540 --> 05:13.020
Yeah. I mean,
I've looked at years of records

05:13.100 --> 05:15.700
and I can't find any other
esophageal cancer sufferer

05:15.780 --> 05:17.860
who's responded this well
to chemotherapy alone.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.100
I mean, not one.

05:20.060 --> 05:21.340
Wow.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.220
My father dies, the company
I'm selling is worthless,

05:24.300 --> 05:27.500
no one will buy the house
because someone died there, but you...

05:27.580 --> 05:31.100
you get cancer and just in a few months,
you're almost cured.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.420
It's a bloody miracle.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.140
I'm just lucky, I guess.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.780
Yeah. I'd love a bit of your luck.

05:37.060 --> 05:40.980
Well, er, I did recently lose
a very close friend, so...

05:41.060 --> 05:43.100
Right. I can't imagine
how much pain you're in,

05:43.180 --> 05:44.820
losing a trusted friend like Will.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.540
Oh, no, I meant, um...

05:48.620 --> 05:50.420
I meant my other friend, Ash.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.020
Wow. It's dangerous to be your friend.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.940
Anyway, I'm gonna need you
to keep a lid on the good news for now.

05:57.780 --> 06:00.660
- Why?
- Well, if you suddenly get better,

06:00.740 --> 06:02.380
people will stop buying the bracelets,

06:02.460 --> 06:04.980
so it'd just be good
if you recovered after the launch.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.900
Right. How... how long after?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.420
- A few months.
- I mean, you can tell your family.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.460
- No, he can't, Michael!
- You can't tell your family.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.020
And we don't need any more leaks, do we?

06:14.100 --> 06:16.780
Well, now, I promise,
that was not me, okay?

06:16.860 --> 06:19.020
That leak had huge repercussions
on my marriage.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.260
And I'm gonna need some PR photos
of you wearing the bracelet.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.420
You are doing the fun run, aren't you?

06:24.780 --> 06:25.900
Yeah, of course.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.780
And then we can say something
about how the bracelet

06:27.860 --> 06:28.940
helped you with your recovery.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.540
Oh... wouldn't... wouldn't that be lying?

06:32.940 --> 06:35.500
I'm sure you've told a few white lies
in your time, Daniel.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.820
Can this be the last time
I'm used in any We Cover promotions?

06:41.900 --> 06:45.140
Sure. As long as you keep your recovery
quiet until after the launch,

06:45.540 --> 06:46.780
you've got a deal.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.220
Okay.

06:50.100 --> 06:50.940
Deal.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.580
I think Kenny's
got something to do with this.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.540
Oh!

06:56.620 --> 06:59.020
Yeah, and I think he's up there
right now, just...

07:00.460 --> 07:03.140
looking down on you.
I'm sorry, but I do.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.260
Yeah.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.660
Yeah, maybe he is.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.220
So, Sherry said that by the time
we're fully paid-up members here...

07:20.740 --> 07:23.780
I shall be a partner at St Frederick's.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.700
That is wonderful, darling.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.180
You'll be able to afford
to have more bikes stolen.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.900
Excuse me. Oh.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.380
DANIEL: THOSE SCANS ARE TOO GOOD!

07:33.700 --> 07:36.060
- Put that down, darling.
- I'm sorry. I'm being...

07:37.420 --> 07:38.740
I'm being very rude.

07:39.900 --> 07:44.980
I was wondering whether you and I
should stay here this weekend.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.580
Oh. Er, yes, wonderful, all right.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.820
Well, I'll see if they've got
a couple of rooms

07:50.900 --> 07:53.180
after we've finished our puddings.

07:54.580 --> 07:55.460
One room?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.060
Mmm, one room?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.220
Oh!

08:00.980 --> 08:02.460
Ah!

08:02.860 --> 08:06.660
Dr. Glennis. I didn't know
you were a member here.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.260
Oh, do I... do I know you?

08:09.340 --> 08:11.140
Humphrey Shankowic.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.620
Remember? We had a meeting recently.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.180
Shank... owic.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.380
Yes, yes.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.460
And this must be your daughter.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.540
No, she's too old to be my daughter.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.780
Oh, don't tell me you're having an affair
with a sexy nurse at St Frederick's!

08:28.860 --> 08:30.060
Oh!

08:31.140 --> 08:32.419
Wrong again.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.179
Allow me to introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.220
This is Annette.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.740
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.820
How do you know my husband?

08:42.179 --> 08:44.820
I, er... I've got
a pharmaceutical company.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.820
Your husband puts a lot of...
business my way.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.540
Everything... everything good
in your world?

08:50.980 --> 08:52.900
Mmm... yeah.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.780
Great, for the most.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.940
You know what it's like,
trying to keep your shareholders happy.

08:59.620 --> 09:02.020
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I do.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.820
Well, we're just about to
order our dessert.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.540
What a delightful couple you both make.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.820
You, so...

09:11.500 --> 09:13.660
beautiful and elegant,

09:13.740 --> 09:15.060
and you...

09:17.580 --> 09:19.140
such a good doctor.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.380
Oh, thank you, thank you.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.980
Well, I'll leave you both in peace.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.660
Take good care of yourselves.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.780
Same to you.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.620
Oh, and, er, stay hydrated.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.340
You too.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.900
<i>Okay, so the 72 hours are up,</i>

09:40.980 --> 09:43.500
<i>and you are ready to take your phone
out of the bowl of rice.</i>

09:44.220 --> 09:45.740
<i>But don't throw the rice away.</i>

09:45.820 --> 09:48.060
<i>If you go over to my cooking channel,
It Tex Two,</i>

09:48.140 --> 09:51.300
<i>you'll find a great rice recipe
for when you and your lady</i>

09:51.380 --> 09:53.260
<i>just want to Netflix and chilli.</i>

09:53.340 --> 09:54.940
Arsehole!

09:55.020 --> 09:56.380
<i>Now for the moment of truth.</i>

10:02.060 --> 10:03.180
Yes!

10:04.140 --> 10:05.300
Oh...

10:05.660 --> 10:07.900
Oh, oh, oh, God!

10:10.980 --> 10:11.860
YOU FUCKED ME SO GOOD

10:11.940 --> 10:13.220
I WANT THAT COCK RIGHT NOW

10:16.660 --> 10:18.540
I fucking knew it!

10:30.495 --> 10:33.255
It doesn't have a torch,
it doesn't have a staple remover.

10:33.935 --> 10:35.615
It's just not the office bracelet.

10:36.815 --> 10:38.975
Although it does still hold paperclips.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.895
I know.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.495
I thought it was a great idea.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.135
Just, at least this way, you know,
it's helping loads of people.

10:49.975 --> 10:51.455
You should be proud of yourself.

10:54.255 --> 10:56.455
What would I do without you?

10:59.255 --> 11:01.215
So, have you moved out yet?

11:02.455 --> 11:04.855
No. It's... it's a work in progress.

11:05.175 --> 11:08.855
I've got a few flat viewings
lined up, so...

11:11.535 --> 11:13.295
We still have to go for that drink.

11:13.375 --> 11:17.295
Yeah. Yeah, why don't we go
after the photo shoot?

11:17.855 --> 11:18.935
Okay.

11:19.655 --> 11:20.935
Hey, can I, um...

11:22.255 --> 11:23.335
Can I tell you a secret?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.535
Yes. I love secrets!

11:27.655 --> 11:28.855
Um...

11:29.655 --> 11:30.815
I'm getting better.

11:32.415 --> 11:33.775
What?

11:33.855 --> 11:35.055
Yeah.

11:35.575 --> 11:38.895
That's wonderful news! Oh, my God, yeah!

11:38.975 --> 11:41.495
Why aren't we celebrating?

11:41.575 --> 11:45.615
I can't tell anyone yet.
Not for a few months.

11:46.175 --> 11:49.815
Not until the campaign
has raised a lot of money.

11:51.815 --> 11:53.015
I'm just telling you.

11:56.455 --> 11:57.455
Oh-ho!

12:00.255 --> 12:01.735
I'm over the moon for you.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.975
Thanks.

12:08.175 --> 12:10.215
<i>So, Darren, you've come to us today</i>

12:10.295 --> 12:12.895
<i>with quite a good idea
of what you'd like to get out of this.</i>

12:12.975 --> 12:15.935
<i>Yeah, well, it's our first venture.
You know, my dad was a builder...</i>

12:19.415 --> 12:20.295
Becca?

12:22.135 --> 12:24.095
Open this door. I know you're in there.

12:25.215 --> 12:26.615
I know what you did!

12:28.255 --> 12:29.935
I know you had an affair with Ash!

12:30.415 --> 12:31.815
You can't hide forever.

12:34.415 --> 12:36.015
Were you with him the day he died?

12:37.095 --> 12:38.415
What happened?

12:43.815 --> 12:45.495
Hey, Athan. Look who's here.

12:45.575 --> 12:47.735
Daniel, good to see you again, mate.

12:47.815 --> 12:49.895
Welcome to my workshop stroke studio.

12:49.975 --> 12:53.295
I make films,
take photos and repair bikes.

12:53.375 --> 12:56.055
I, er, specialize in penny farthings.
Here.

12:56.295 --> 12:58.855
Oh. I didn't realize
people still rode those.

12:59.215 --> 13:01.135
You'd be surprised. Shall we get inside?

13:01.495 --> 13:03.055
And please, keep the noise down.

13:03.135 --> 13:05.055
General Gordon
didn't sleep well last night.

13:06.295 --> 13:08.135
Who's... who's General Gordon?

13:10.535 --> 13:12.095
Yeah, I'm not really seeing the bracelet.

13:12.175 --> 13:13.975
Do you wanna hold it up a bit,
sort of show it off?

13:15.655 --> 13:16.735
You look too tense, mate.

13:16.815 --> 13:19.055
Imagine you're a candle
in Westminster Abbey,

13:19.135 --> 13:22.815
softening as the wax drips onto the statue
of William Gladstone below.

13:23.535 --> 13:26.575
Yeah, I don't...
I'm really hot under these lights.

13:26.655 --> 13:28.255
Switch for the ceiling fan's over there.

13:28.335 --> 13:29.535
- The black one.
- Oh, I'll get it.

13:33.295 --> 13:34.415
You've set the alarm!

13:34.495 --> 13:35.455
Sorry!

13:37.215 --> 13:38.775
I think it might've been my bracelet.

13:43.095 --> 13:44.775
- For fuck's sake!
- Sorry.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.535
Thought it was on silent.

13:47.935 --> 13:49.855
- Hey, Vanessa.
- <i>Hi, Daniel.</i>

13:51.175 --> 13:52.535
I need to tell you something.

13:54.295 --> 13:55.335
Yeah?

13:56.935 --> 13:58.415
You still... still there?

13:59.055 --> 14:00.055
Yeah.

14:00.575 --> 14:01.895
I need to tell you...

14:07.535 --> 14:09.055
I need to tell you how great you are.

14:10.935 --> 14:13.175
Good luck with the charity run.

14:13.255 --> 14:14.815
Oh, er, thanks.

14:15.935 --> 14:18.815
Benny's crying.
I'll catch you later, Daniel.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.495
I have to go with Athan
and General Gordon to the vet.

14:23.575 --> 14:26.535
He needs me to drive him.
We think he's having a heart attack.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.455
Oh.

14:27.535 --> 14:30.255
So we'll have to grab that drink tomorrow,
after the run.

14:30.335 --> 14:32.055
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

14:38.935 --> 14:42.895
I'll show you hard... you slut!

14:48.615 --> 14:51.215
Right, let's see what we've got.

15:00.375 --> 15:01.495
What?

15:10.775 --> 15:11.815
But you're dead.

15:12.695 --> 15:13.615
Are you...

15:14.895 --> 15:16.055
a ghost?

15:18.735 --> 15:19.975
He's alive.

15:39.055 --> 15:40.335
Any news about Will?

15:41.415 --> 15:42.295
No.

15:43.135 --> 15:44.415
He's still dead.

15:44.615 --> 15:47.375
First Ash, now Will.
That's two of your best friends.

15:47.455 --> 15:48.655
Well, two of your only friends.

15:49.455 --> 15:50.495
Mmm.

15:50.975 --> 15:53.135
- Yeah, it's mental, innit?
- Well, apart from your doctor.

15:53.215 --> 15:54.975
Let's hope nothing happens to him, or me.

15:57.935 --> 15:59.575
So, you're doing your fun run tomorrow?

16:00.895 --> 16:01.975
Yeah.

16:02.055 --> 16:03.535
- You don't have to come.
- Oh, no worries.

16:03.615 --> 16:05.255
If you don't want me there, then it's...

16:10.655 --> 16:11.855
Daniel...

16:15.095 --> 16:16.415
I'm...

16:20.935 --> 16:22.215
going to bed.

16:23.335 --> 16:24.495
Night.

16:31.215 --> 16:33.895
You know, I think someone <i>did</i> fall
from that window.

16:35.615 --> 16:36.735
What?

16:36.815 --> 16:39.455
Yeah, I think they tried to get in
through the window, the drainpipe broke

16:39.535 --> 16:41.455
- and they fell into our bathroom.
- That's ridiculous!

16:43.095 --> 16:44.335
It was squirrels.

16:45.175 --> 16:47.895
- I saw. It was squirrels.
- Yeah...

16:48.615 --> 16:49.655
I don't know.

16:54.175 --> 16:56.135
Okay. Good night.

17:01.975 --> 17:03.135
Fucking hell!

17:12.575 --> 17:16.655
07700 900843,
Dr. Iain Glennis speak... Oh, yes, yes.

17:17.535 --> 17:20.375
Yes, this weekend.
It's a special occasion.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.935
Well, yes, I was wondering
if we could arrange, er,

17:24.015 --> 17:28.775
to get a bottle of your finest champagne
delivered to the room upon our arrival.

17:29.935 --> 17:31.775
How much?

17:31.855 --> 17:33.295
What about your fifth finest?

17:33.575 --> 17:35.495
How's about giving us a nice smile?

17:36.455 --> 17:38.495
Best legs since 1978.

17:39.495 --> 17:40.855
Thank you, kind sir.

17:40.935 --> 17:44.495
Seems to be a bit of an issue
with me paying cash.

17:44.575 --> 17:46.735
Now, my issue is that I have...

17:49.615 --> 17:50.935
Get in! Get in!

17:51.015 --> 17:52.855
Come on, I'll buy you
a glass of white wine.

17:52.935 --> 17:54.775
Please leave me alone!

17:54.855 --> 17:56.055
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

17:58.975 --> 18:01.055
- Shit!
- Bloody lesbo!

18:02.375 --> 18:04.215
- <i>South Thames Police. How...</i>
- It's Haywood.

18:04.295 --> 18:06.375
- I need to speak to the Chief right away.
- <i>Henchy's not here.</i>

18:06.455 --> 18:08.655
<i>It's Operation Thunderbolt.
Shouldn't you be at your desk?</i>

18:08.735 --> 18:10.775
I'm... at a doctor's appointment.

18:10.855 --> 18:13.615
<i>Yeah, it's a big drugs bust
in South East London.</i>

18:14.095 --> 18:15.495
<i>Recording.</i>

18:15.575 --> 18:19.455
1400 hours. Dr. Iain Glennis
kidnapped by masked men in a black van.

18:19.535 --> 18:21.415
Unable to give chase
due to lack of transport.

18:21.495 --> 18:23.335
I suspect the doctor's associate
Daniel Glass

18:23.415 --> 18:24.535
is behind the kidnapping.

18:25.455 --> 18:28.655
Can we have a big old round of applause
for Daniel Glass and We Cover?

18:28.735 --> 18:29.855
Thank you very much. Thank you.

18:31.375 --> 18:34.295
Great appreciation for all
your efforts today. Absolutely fantastic.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.575
<i>Hello, We Cover insurance.</i>

18:35.655 --> 18:37.975
- <i>Live a great life.</i>
- Hello there, I'm a friend...

18:38.055 --> 18:40.215
Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daniel Glass.

18:40.295 --> 18:41.455
Is he in the office today?

18:41.535 --> 18:43.855
<i>No, he's doing the Live A Great Life
fun run.</i>

18:48.735 --> 18:51.255
<i>Welcome to
the Live A Great Life fun run.</i>

18:51.335 --> 18:53.535
<i>Don't forget to get your wristband.
All for a great cause.</i>

18:53.615 --> 18:57.735
<i>A new charity drive in association
with We Cover insurance.</i>

19:01.695 --> 19:02.895
Where's the photographer?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.735
Oh, he's nearly here.
He had to visit his parrot in hospital.

19:06.335 --> 19:08.895
I don't suppose you've seen
my wife and daughter, have you?

19:08.975 --> 19:10.895
- They said they were gonna come.
- I haven't.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.655
Is everything sorted out now?

19:12.735 --> 19:15.615
No. I just want to impress them
with my running times.

19:15.695 --> 19:18.375
- Did they say they were coming?
- Well, it's in the shared calendar.

19:18.455 --> 19:19.335
Who cares?

19:20.535 --> 19:21.695
I'm sure they'll come, Michael.

19:22.135 --> 19:23.695
- Oh, here's Athan.
- Finally!

19:23.775 --> 19:25.935
Soz. Couldn't find anywhere
to lock the penny farthing up.

19:26.015 --> 19:27.335
How's your parrot?

19:27.415 --> 19:30.215
General Gordon's under observation,
but I think he'll pull through.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.295
- General Gordon?
- Hey, group selfie.

19:32.935 --> 19:34.255
Okay, make it quick.

19:36.335 --> 19:37.935
Technically it's not a selfie, but...

19:38.375 --> 19:39.575
Kimchi!

19:40.895 --> 19:44.375
<i>Three, two, one... Off you go, guys!</i>

19:44.455 --> 19:50.255
<i>Best of luck to you all today, here at
the run through Crystal Palace 5K...</i>

19:51.295 --> 19:54.855
Um, I hope you don't mind,
but I'm just gonna press on ahead,

19:54.935 --> 19:57.415
‘cause I've got a personal record
I wanna beat, so...

20:01.015 --> 20:03.255
- Really gonna need that drink after this.
- Oh, yes.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.575
I can't wait.

20:08.095 --> 20:10.895
Daniel, you can't do phone calls
while running.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.055
You'll get out of breath.

20:12.135 --> 20:13.855
Sorry, it's my doctor. Must be important.

20:14.535 --> 20:15.975
- Oh. Catch me up.
- Yeah.

20:16.055 --> 20:16.895
Hello?

20:16.975 --> 20:18.735
<i>I need you to do something right away.</i>

20:18.815 --> 20:20.495
I'm a bit busy
running a fucking marathon.

20:20.575 --> 20:22.535
<i>The drugs we sold were placebos.</i>

20:23.015 --> 20:25.735
- What?
- <i>I need you to go to my house.</i>

20:25.815 --> 20:29.815
<i>Annette isn't there. Go into my bedroom.
Their cash is in the wardrobe.</i>

20:29.895 --> 20:32.055
<i>Would you please bring it
to Shank's flat?</i>

20:32.135 --> 20:32.975
Shank?

20:33.055 --> 20:35.055
<i>You need to do it now,</i>

20:35.655 --> 20:37.055
<i>or he's going to kill me</i>

20:37.135 --> 20:39.655
<i>and then he is going to kill you.</i>

20:40.495 --> 20:42.095
<i>Do you understand, Daniel?</i>

20:42.175 --> 20:44.215
Oh, yeah, all right, okay, I'm on my way.

20:54.095 --> 20:55.935
Daniel is on his way with your money.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.375
I haven't had to kill anyone
for six years.

21:10.975 --> 21:11.975
Crumbs!

21:17.855 --> 21:19.015
Shit!

21:21.615 --> 21:23.695
Don't be hasty.
You see, I'm treating someone

21:23.775 --> 21:24.935
who is pretending to have cancer.

21:25.015 --> 21:27.095
Well, that's disgusting. Who'd do that?

21:27.575 --> 21:30.935
I switched down out his medication,
so I started giving him placebos.

21:31.015 --> 21:31.935
Placebos?

21:35.295 --> 21:36.415
Yes!

21:39.215 --> 21:40.615
Ended up selling you the fake pills.

21:40.695 --> 21:42.615
Who fakes cancer?

21:43.295 --> 21:44.255
Come on!

21:44.335 --> 21:46.895
- It's your little ginger friend.
- Yes!

21:47.455 --> 21:49.935
I'm not letting you
out of my sight, you little bastard.

21:50.015 --> 21:52.015
Who fakes cancer?

21:56.018 --> 22:01.018
