WEBVTT

00:14.315 --> 00:16.184
MAN ( over P.A. ):
Southbound train arriving,

00:16.217 --> 00:17.251
one minute, Track One.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.521
Southbound train
on Track One.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.263
( alarm blaring )

01:09.703 --> 01:13.541
Freeze! Stop!

01:13.574 --> 01:14.675
( screaming )

01:18.346 --> 01:21.081
Stop! Stop running!
Stop now!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.393
MAN ( over bullhorn ):
Hold your positions!

01:32.426 --> 01:33.861
Exercise is terminated.
Hold your positions.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.431
Hold your positions.
Exercise is terminated.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.799
Good work.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.908
We foiled
a sarin attack.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.910
Excellent job.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.512
But my undercover
sheriffs...

01:51.545 --> 01:55.216
you would've
done better

01:55.249 --> 01:58.286
if you kept the bad guys alive,
get information...

01:58.319 --> 02:00.588
So we're going to
do it again.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.757
Everybody
get set up.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.926
We're doing it again.
( alarm sounds )

02:05.959 --> 02:09.530
( screaming )

02:11.399 --> 02:13.834
Conductor, conductor,
open the doors, open the doors!

02:13.867 --> 02:15.603
Conductor, open the doors now!

02:17.205 --> 02:19.340
Everybody out! Out, out, out!

02:19.373 --> 02:22.910
( coughing and gasping )

02:29.517 --> 02:30.484
What have we got?

02:30.518 --> 02:33.487
The guy in charge
of the drill called it in.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.955
He didn't want to speak to me
until you got here.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.424
Hey.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.858
James Grace,
Homeland Security.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.793
Don Eppes, FBI.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.362
So James, you want to give me
a little rundown here?

02:41.395 --> 02:42.930
We were conducting
an anti-terror drill:

02:42.963 --> 02:45.866
testing new bio-chem sensors
and our response.

02:45.899 --> 02:46.767
At the end of the drill,

02:46.800 --> 02:49.203
a few of the sensors
went off for real,

02:49.237 --> 02:50.971
indicating that there was

02:51.004 --> 02:52.240
some kind of release
of toxin into the air.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.407
Do you know
what it was?

02:53.441 --> 02:56.277
HAZMAT's identified it
as phosgene,

02:56.310 --> 02:56.977
a relative of chlorine.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.612
And what about
all the people?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.848
Everyone on the train
were either MTA employees

03:00.881 --> 03:02.983
or undercover cops.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.985
I was told six of them
went to the hospital,

03:05.018 --> 03:06.254
but everybody's okay.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.522
Wait, didn't we
get a memo, right,

03:08.556 --> 03:09.790
that you guys
were planning more drills?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.459
Yup. This was just
our first one.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.362
We got ten more in L.A.
the next seven days.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.364
James, what the hell happened?

03:16.397 --> 03:17.865
We don't know yet,
Peter.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.668
Special Agent Eppes,
Special Agent Reeves, FBI.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.735
Peter Houseman,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.737
from Homeland Security...
oversees these drills.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.938
Glad to have the Bureau's help.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.006
What can you tell me?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.642
but I can tell youre,

03:28.676 --> 03:30.244
I think you should put
your other exercises on hold.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.246
Sorry, but that's
not an option.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.414
Not an option?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.683
We've been planning these
exercises for the past year.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.684
I've got drills

03:36.717 --> 03:39.753
in nine different cities
in the next six months.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.955
We pack up now,
we won't be coming back.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.956
Well, I understand that,

03:42.990 --> 03:45.326
but until we find out
what happened here...

03:45.359 --> 03:47.027
We'll continue to run
these tests...

03:47.060 --> 03:49.530
In L.A.'s local airport,
in the hospitals,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.332
in the harbors...

03:51.365 --> 03:53.033
I'm not going to compromise
the safety of Los Angeles

03:53.066 --> 03:55.035
because some janitor left
the lid off a jar.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.004
Washington thinks
the chances

03:57.037 --> 03:59.373
of this being an actual
terrorist attack

03:59.407 --> 04:01.041
are slim to none.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.276
I agree.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.777
And that's based on...?

04:03.811 --> 04:04.712
Logic.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.281
Terrorists go after
maximum casualties.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.749
They don't go after
anti-terror drills.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.983
MEGAN:
That is one

04:10.017 --> 04:11.285
type of profile.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.219
There are so many others.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.455
You think somebody
did this deliberately,

04:14.488 --> 04:16.990
it is your job
to find them.

04:17.024 --> 04:17.991
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.993
See, I didn't realize
the FBI takes orders

04:20.027 --> 04:21.061
from Homeland Security.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.596
Fine.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.031
You've got your work
cut out for you.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.065
And I've got a job

04:25.098 --> 04:27.868
to do of my own.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.504
Your boss
always this reasonable?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.005
He's right.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.608
Stop the drills now,
it's like turning the Titanic.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.845
The Titanic hit an iceberg.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.351
We all use math every day.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.985
To predict weather...

04:45.018 --> 04:47.888
to tell time...

04:47.921 --> 04:51.058
to handle money.

04:51.091 --> 04:55.763
Math is more than
formulas and equations...

04:55.796 --> 04:58.766
It's logic...

04:58.799 --> 05:00.768
It's rationality...

05:00.801 --> 05:02.903
It's using your mind

05:02.936 --> 05:05.973
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.047
Hey, Dad,
you seen Charlie?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.449
...right.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.718
40 portable chairs,
a banquet table,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.620
and an arbor.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.021
For Saturday.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.391
Okay, great.
See you then.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.493
An arbor?

05:25.526 --> 05:26.927
You're right,
that upstairs bedroom

05:26.960 --> 05:28.562
would make
a great changing room.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.931
Good.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.366
- Val?
- Hey, Don!

05:32.400 --> 05:33.834
It's been a long time.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.436
Since high school
graduation.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.404
Look at you--
you look great.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.939
Thank you. I think the
last time I saw you,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.074
you were driving off
in that VW you had.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.611
My clutch gave out
right by Ventura.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.746
What's going on?

05:45.779 --> 05:48.482
She's getting married.
Yeah, right here.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.950
- Yup.
- Oh, you're kidding.

05:49.983 --> 05:50.818
What, here at the house?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.985
VAL:
Yeah, my fiance

05:52.019 --> 05:53.487
and I were planning
a big June wedding

05:53.521 --> 05:55.689
but then he just got transferred
to London this year,

05:55.723 --> 05:58.459
and my mother, she flew
into a total panic...

05:58.492 --> 05:59.960
Val's parents invited
us to the wedding

05:59.993 --> 06:01.028
and I found out
what was going on.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.129
They just sold
their place

06:02.162 --> 06:03.864
and moved into a one-bedroom
on Wilshire, so I said

06:03.897 --> 06:06.133
What the hell, it's no problem.
Have it here.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.435
Sure, why not?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.469
Thank you.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.404
- Wow.
- So, um...

06:10.438 --> 06:12.005
you're an FBI agent.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.140
Had to make amends somehow.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.543
And what are you up to?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.910
Pediatric surgery.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.078
Yeah, she's a doctor.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.647
Yeah, yeah.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.615
Your dad was telling
me about Charlie...

06:21.649 --> 06:23.684
The math rock star, huh?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.018
No surprise there, right?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.153
We always figured he'd do
something special.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.889
You forgot that big fight
you had with your brother

06:28.922 --> 06:30.090
when you invited Val
to the prom?

06:30.123 --> 06:30.924
Come on, Dad,

06:30.958 --> 06:32.159
what are you talking about
a fight?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.561
He was 13.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.928
He was going to go
out with her?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.196
You'll forgive me
if my recollection

06:36.229 --> 06:37.164
is different from yours.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.103
So, anyway, I hear
you two work together now.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.505
Yeah, when I can find him.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.138
Not that I don't want to
reminisce,

06:45.172 --> 06:46.173
but it's why I'm here.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.775
Charlie was in the garage...

06:47.808 --> 06:49.209
No, no, wait, I just saw him
go out front.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.479
All right... hey,
great seeing you, Val.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.613
You, too.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.647
You're gonna come,
right?

06:53.681 --> 06:56.083
Umm...

06:56.116 --> 06:58.018
Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.152
Good.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.588
Congratulations.
You look great.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.155
Oh, thanks.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.928
So, this is where all those
university research dollars go.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.831
Everything you see here
came out of our own pockets.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.166
CalSci's Mini-Bot "Chain Yank
and Crank" is next Friday.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.135
LARRY: After five years
of ignominy,

07:15.168 --> 07:16.670
the Physics Department

07:16.704 --> 07:18.906
has ascended to the finals
against Engineering,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.908
thanks to Professor Charles
Edward Eppes.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.976
CHARLIE: I just "free-styled"
Faraday's Law of Induction

07:23.010 --> 07:26.246
to triple amp the armature coil
and maximize horsepower.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.548
This thing's actually
going to pull the car?

07:27.581 --> 07:29.850
LARRY:
Hm-mm... six feet to glory.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.084
Let's do it.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
- All righty.
- Guys, there's something else.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.957
This is it.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.593
Come on, come on, Physics
department.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.129
All right, let's see.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.202
CHARLIE: There it is.
There we go.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.704
You see that?
It's moving!

07:50.738 --> 07:54.542
( excited muttering )

07:57.611 --> 07:59.747
Okay, halfway there.
Three feet. Halfway...

07:59.780 --> 08:00.948
Come on, baby.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.950
We did it!

08:02.983 --> 08:04.251
( motor stops )

08:08.155 --> 08:09.823
Sorry, guys.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.124
This is like 1998

08:11.158 --> 08:12.693
all over again.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.194
Hey, did you see Val?

08:14.227 --> 08:16.530
Yeah, yeah.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.532
A doctor.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.934
Well, her talents
always were in biology.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.302
I take it you both knew
this woman?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.772
We were all in the same class
in high school.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.973
LARRY:
Oh, yeah.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.541
I keep forgetting you
graduated the same year.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.242
So you're not here
to talk about Val.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.143
Yeah, right.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.312
You know anything
about phosgene gas?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.881
A diluted form of it

08:33.914 --> 08:35.515
was released on the subway
this morning.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.585
Oh, my God.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.251
We're trying to figure out

08:38.285 --> 08:39.386
if it was an accident...

08:39.419 --> 08:41.589
like, maybe a maintenance worker
mixing bottles together.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.724
Phosgene's used in the
manufacture

08:43.757 --> 08:47.027
of dyes and pesticides.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.296
It's in the chlorine family
and it is highly toxic.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.665
Theoretically,
it could be

08:51.699 --> 08:53.901
accidentally produced
by combining

08:53.934 --> 08:55.803
certain cleaning agents
but that's...

08:55.836 --> 08:56.670
that's very unlikely.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.572
So, it probably
wasn't an accident?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
CHARLIE: What was the
delivery mechanism?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.710
Do you know
if it was an air duct

09:02.743 --> 09:03.744
or a canister...?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.579
We don't know yet. Why?

09:05.613 --> 09:06.279
Because when gas
dissipates,

09:06.313 --> 09:08.048
it leaves
a trail behind.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.583
You may be able to determine
the original release point.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.284
And if we find that out?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.553
You may find who released it.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.566
Oh, looks like
we got something.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.644
The drill
participants

09:36.677 --> 09:38.946
were all MTA employees,
or law enforcement.

09:38.979 --> 09:42.182
MTA windbreaker's easy enough
to get your hands on.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.652
So it looks like the guy
dumped this out here

09:44.685 --> 09:46.286
in the confusion, and then
walked away a new man.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.456
COLBY:
Gas mask...

09:49.489 --> 09:51.925
MEGAN: Is that a cafe latte
to go?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.827
I love these things.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.396
Looks like someone drilled
a hole in it

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
and then resealed it.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.271
Well, now what?

10:04.304 --> 10:07.340
Now, we buy Charlie a coffee.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.110
These coffee drinks...
I've seen 'em.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.345
Half my students suck down
one per lecture.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.848
DON: Let me see it--
how's it work?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.216
The can has an internal
heating system.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.685
There's a button
on the bottom...

10:17.718 --> 10:21.021
You press it... and water mixes
with quicklime.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.056
It's highly exothermic,
and it can produce heat

10:23.090 --> 10:25.793
as high as
140 degrees Fahrenheit.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.828
And it makes
a really nice latte.

10:27.861 --> 10:28.896
And quite

10:28.929 --> 10:29.963
an efficient delivery system.

10:29.997 --> 10:30.998
Here you go.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.399
Kept at 48 degrees,

10:32.432 --> 10:33.500
phosgene's a stable liquid.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.970
Above that, it turns
into a potentially deadly gas.

10:37.004 --> 10:41.308
This diagram illustrates gas
intensity levels

10:41.341 --> 10:42.109
throughout the subway car,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.678
as measured
by first-responders.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.814
Now, using that data,
I was able to run

10:46.847 --> 10:48.248
a Gaussian Plume
Dispersion Model...

10:48.281 --> 10:49.416
a manner in which
to determine

10:49.449 --> 10:51.018
the pattern of the gas release.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.352
Now, to the naked eye,

10:52.385 --> 10:54.988
a gas release can appear
as one large cloud.

10:55.022 --> 10:58.826
The gas will spread
from its release point

10:58.859 --> 11:02.295
driven by air currents
to open doors and windows.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.264
Obstacles in the path
of the gas

11:04.297 --> 11:06.433
will affect its dispersion.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.401
One large cloud is
actually comprised

11:08.435 --> 11:10.437
of many separate plumes.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.774
Using a generalized
diffusion equation

11:13.807 --> 11:15.709
I was able to backtrack,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.145
to find the origin point
of the gas release.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.914
Your assailant released
the gas here--

11:20.948 --> 11:23.116
precisely in the center
of the car.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.985
Why right there?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.387
Well, this placement allows
for the greatest dispersion.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.056
See, this air ducts on
the perimeter,

11:29.089 --> 11:30.958
there's no way
for the gas to vent out.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.425
Right. Theoretically it was
released in a way

11:32.459 --> 11:33.426
to maximize deaths.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.764
Remember, you said
the phosgene was diluted.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.465
And it was, by mixing in
a harmless additive

11:38.498 --> 11:39.399
to negate its deadliness.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.268
Someone with this type
of proficiency...

11:41.301 --> 11:43.470
this wasn't a mistake.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.739
Which means this person
could have taken lives,

11:45.773 --> 11:46.974
but chose not to.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.742
We know he deliberately
chose to target

11:48.776 --> 11:49.676
and anti-terrorism drill.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.378
So we're talking about
a high-risk-taker,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.180
with a thrill-seeking
disposition.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.514
Right, it's like
a game to them.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.817
And most thrill-seekers
are adrenaline junkies.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.819
So I'd say our guy's
going to strike again.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.520
Only this time he'll need
to up the ante.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.056
We're going to get ourselves
some real casualties.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.764
Back to the office. Get that
memo to the director.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.899
Mr. Houseman!

12:11.932 --> 12:14.067
Look, I know you're not
going to want to hear this,

12:14.101 --> 12:16.169
but I really think
you're going to have to put

12:16.203 --> 12:17.237
those exercises on hold.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.539
I don't like having the same
conversation twice.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.441
Neither do I, but
that gas was released

12:21.474 --> 12:22.976
intentionally, all right?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.812
By someone planning
to do some serious harm.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.179
And you know
this how?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.981
Among other things,
a mathematical analysis,

12:28.015 --> 12:28.816
which I stand by.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.551
Really? I've got
some math for you.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.987
How about 52 killed
in a London subway?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.022
- 191 in Madrid.
- Right.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.456
Do I really need
to mention 9/11?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.525
No, I get your point,
and here's mine, okay?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.027
Because everything
we know tells us

12:40.060 --> 12:42.029
whoever did this is
going to do it again

12:42.062 --> 12:44.431
and the next time the gas
is not going to be harmless.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.133
We've got chemical plants
that are exposed,

12:46.166 --> 12:47.267
we've got harbors.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.568
Our food supply, water--

12:48.601 --> 12:50.337
all very vulnerable
to attack.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.372
This city needs these exercises
to protect itself.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.474
I understand that, but I'll
telling you right now,

12:54.507 --> 12:56.543
if we don't stop them,
I am going on record

12:56.576 --> 12:57.978
saying you're
making a mistake.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.446
And I think at
the very least,

12:59.479 --> 13:00.347
we should inform the people

13:00.380 --> 13:02.182
that are partaking
in these exercises.

13:02.215 --> 13:02.950
And totally corrupt
the exercises.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.217
That would accomplish
nothing.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.453
Look, Agent,

13:06.486 --> 13:07.587
I've had some experience

13:07.620 --> 13:08.889
making tough
decisions like these

13:08.922 --> 13:09.990
when I oversaw
base security

13:10.023 --> 13:11.091
as a consultant in Iraq.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.159
The question is,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.327
would you rather write
two letters of condolence

13:14.361 --> 13:16.563
or 200,000?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.933
Hi, there, gentlemen.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.168
What happened, Larry?

13:21.201 --> 13:24.304
Charlie draft you into another
one of those investigations?

13:24.337 --> 13:26.173
You're not going
to believe this.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.975
Somebody attacked an
anti-terrorism drill

13:28.008 --> 13:29.042
on the subway.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.178
Was anyone hurt?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.579
No, fortunately
our budding terrorist

13:32.612 --> 13:36.383
utilized a diluted form
of phosgene gas.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.351
Hey, Charlie, you know,
I could use a hand

13:38.385 --> 13:40.921
getting the yard ready
for the wedding.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.190
Yeah, Don needs to figure out
what happened ASAP.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.125
Come on, she was
your friend, too.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.327
I guess this is what I get
for volunteering, huh?

13:47.360 --> 13:51.498
Yeah, for volunteering
my house-- yeah, that's fair.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.599
I'm providing house,

13:52.632 --> 13:53.833
you provide labor.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.070
I understand Don and Charles
went to school with this girl.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.071
Oh, yeah.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.907
Your friend Charlie

13:59.940 --> 14:01.108
had quite a crush
on that girl.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.544
I was 13, and she
was my lab partner.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.980
You weren't so casual
about it then.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.281
Especially when Don took her
to the prom. Remember?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.083
They actually had
a wrestling match about it

14:10.117 --> 14:11.451
on the lawn.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.220
Isn't it nice having
a living history

14:13.253 --> 14:15.555
of embarrassing moments
from my childhood.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.290
No, no, no, I'm
quite enjoying the vision

14:17.324 --> 14:20.127
of a young Charles Eppes
moved to violence by a girl.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.561
Oh, he was moved all right.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.230
You know what, can we...
can we...

14:23.263 --> 14:24.064
Why are talking about this?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.465
This is something
that happened...

14:25.498 --> 14:27.167
I have work to...
we have work to...

14:27.200 --> 14:29.169
We have to get
work done.

14:29.202 --> 14:33.206
Yeah. Well, I guess I have
to clip the hedges myself.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.444
How'd it go with
Homeland Security?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.611
It didn't.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.712
The drills are going forward.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.215
There are three tomorrow,
four the day after that.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.151
Well, maybe keeping
the exercises in play is good.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.418
It's limiting
the number of targets.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.254
What do you mean?
There's ten all together.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.989
We don't have troops
to cover all of them.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.357
Maybe we don't need to.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.491
Charlie can probably
help us out there.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.094
- Gentlemen.
- What do you got?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.163
Subway security camera
caught our guy on tape.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.132
Witness saw him dump
his gear in a trash bin.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.268
We ID'd him as
a Roger Holstein, 31

15:01.301 --> 15:03.536
ex-army Special Forces.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.505
Body art was the tip-off.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.540
That tattoo right there?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.276
That means he's
a C-T Team operative.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.610
C-T Team?

15:10.643 --> 15:11.611
Counter Terror.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.480
They're soldiers trained
to role play our enemies

15:13.513 --> 15:15.148
and mimic their tactics.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.216
Including terrorist
simulations.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.517
COLBY:
They test the security

15:17.550 --> 15:19.386
at military bases
and weapons stations

15:19.419 --> 15:20.620
by staging mock attacks.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.389
And the subway strike?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
It's right out
of their playbook.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.658
This guy Holstein,
he's been doing

15:25.692 --> 15:27.294
the exact same kind of work
as a civilian contractor

15:27.327 --> 15:29.129
since he was discharged
from the army.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.564
They're last job
was two months ago.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.566
His team staged a mock attack
on Mirabo Labs--

15:33.600 --> 15:35.268
a private
chemical facility.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.970
What, you think that's where
they got the phosgene?

15:37.004 --> 15:38.371
Yeah.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.040
You say these guys usually
work together in teams?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.274
Always.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.210
Can you play back the tape?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.278
Yeah.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.080
And stop it right there.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.982
Can you zoom in
on his ear?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.017
Mm-hmm.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.253
Highlight that...
right there.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.687
Whoa.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.624
He's wearing an earpiece.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.027
Holstein wasn't giving orders,
he was taking them.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.229
And was this guy in charge
of the operation

16:02.262 --> 16:03.230
at the chemical plant?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.732
No, it was another ex-army,
ex-C-T Team guy.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.267
You got his jacket?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.101
Yeah.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.171
Glen Nash, former
Special Forces,

16:11.204 --> 16:12.739
served in Iraq,
got a medal of valor.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.308
Retired from army
service in '03.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.177
Went into private contracting,
mostly overseas.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.745
Except for a few jobs
in the States

16:18.778 --> 16:19.746
at places like Mirabo.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.481
Jacket says he has
training in

16:21.514 --> 16:24.751
psy-ops, cyber-warfare and
covert operations.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.319
Wow.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.255
What?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.190
In 2002, when he
was still in the army,

16:30.223 --> 16:32.092
he led a C-T operation that
penetrated security

16:32.125 --> 16:34.294
at a naval base
and stole a submarine.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.763
A submarine?

16:36.796 --> 16:38.431
And he only had seven men
in his team.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.233
All right, look, I want
his full background.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.234
I want team photos,
everything.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.569
I want to know
where he is now.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.105
I mean, you tell me
they could steal a submarine

16:45.138 --> 16:47.740
from a naval base
with seven guys?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.710
Think how easy it would be
to attack a wide-open city.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.118
When did you last see
your brother, Ms. Nash?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.052
A couple of months ago.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.754
He was in L.A. doing
some security work.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.556
So I let him crash
on my sofa.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.595
In the morning
he was gone...

17:08.628 --> 17:09.596
no good-byes.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.198
Classic Glen.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.699
Any idea where he went?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.736
We're not that close
these days.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.373
Why is that?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.709
Glen's changed.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.611
You know, he
served in Iraq.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.813
Yeah, we looked
at his service record.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.248
Glen lost men over there.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.549
That hit him pretty hard.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.818
That'll do that.

17:31.851 --> 17:32.819
You were there?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.787
Afghanistan.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.757
Then you know.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.493
Is my brother in
some kind of trouble?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.629
Ms. Nash, right now we
just need to talk to him.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.863
COLBY:
But sooner...

17:43.896 --> 17:46.533
rather than later.

17:47.634 --> 17:52.339
I wish I could help you.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.446
Megan says the only way
we're going to stop these guys

17:59.479 --> 18:00.713
is to catch them
in the act.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.582
You know what? I think
she might be right.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.251
Well, Charlie, look,
I want to stop

18:04.284 --> 18:05.452
something terrible
from happening.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.586
You know, I don't want

18:06.619 --> 18:07.687
to clean up
after it.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.821
I understand.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.557
I'll apply Site
Percolation Theory.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.824
Site Percolation Theory

18:11.858 --> 18:13.860
examines how a
suspect navigates

18:13.893 --> 18:14.794
through a maze
of lattice points--

18:14.827 --> 18:16.863
obstacles-- in order
to achieve an objective.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.831
Come here.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.700
Think of
the exercise

18:20.733 --> 18:23.370
like a pachinko game.

18:23.403 --> 18:27.207
Our attacker is the ball
descending through the maze.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.310
And the nails are like
physical obstacles--

18:30.343 --> 18:31.911
alarm systems, locked doors.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.747
The holes are security traps
laid in his path.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.451
Now, our guy has to navigate
around the obstacles

18:38.485 --> 18:39.719
and avoid security

18:39.752 --> 18:41.721
in order to reach
his objective.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.457
A different pachinko game will
yield different lattice points.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.159
Just like different exercises

18:46.193 --> 18:47.794
will present different
security measures.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.163
Absolutely. Now, by
analyzing the choices

18:50.197 --> 18:52.332
our attacker made that led him
to infiltrate the subway,

18:52.365 --> 18:54.634
I may be able
to postulate an MO.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.904
However, I'm going to need data
from the remaining exercises.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.373
I'll talk to Homeland Security,
sure.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.842
Great.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.811
Hey, did you hear
what Dad's doing?

19:04.844 --> 19:06.779
Oh, my... He's too obsessed
with this wedding.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.815
Honestly, seriously, he went out
and bought himself

19:08.848 --> 19:10.217
a copy of Brides magazine.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
Our little wedding planner.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.786
He says because
he has two sons,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.455
this may be the only chance
he'll have

19:15.488 --> 19:16.723
to get to throw a wedding.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.326
It's kind of weird Val getting
married at our house, though,

19:19.359 --> 19:20.293
don't you think?

19:20.327 --> 19:22.895
Uh-huh. Even weirder,
because I liked her

19:22.929 --> 19:25.798
and, you know, you took
her to the prom.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.535
Come on, you're still
upset about that?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.571
No, I...

19:31.604 --> 19:35.342
Remembering that
brings back other stuff.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.843
Like what?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.779
Like what it was like to be

19:39.812 --> 19:42.282
Don Eppes's 13-year-old
brainiac brother.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.916
Come on, Charlie,
don't start.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.353
I mean, it wasn't
that big a deal.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.756
Not for you, but high school
sucked for me, Don.

19:49.789 --> 19:50.857
Man, I was a little kid.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.492
Everyone was years
older than me.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.960
And yeah, there was
this one girl

19:53.993 --> 19:55.628
who didn't treat me
like I was different.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.796
She was nice to me.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.865
It was no easy trick being
your brother, either, you know.

19:58.898 --> 19:59.832
You're five years
younger than me,

19:59.866 --> 20:01.000
we're in
the same grade.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.569
I'm like an idiot
next to you.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.803
So, I'm sorry if I was
better than you

20:03.836 --> 20:05.004
at something.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.340
Whatever, man.
You're the one that asked.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.514
So, predicting how Nash will
strike is only half the battle.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.649
It's not going
to tell you where.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.019
Well, can you tell us that?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.788
No, but Nash will.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.456
I'll tell you what.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.525
Let me start by looking at
his military operations.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.728
Then I think I'll be able
to tell you more.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.465
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.939
We pulled jackets on
the rest of Nash's team

20:39.972 --> 20:41.474
from the Mirabo Labs job.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.475
Now Holstein

20:42.509 --> 20:44.544
we know about.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.679
The others are Jason Small,
demolition specialist,

20:46.713 --> 20:48.581
and Henry Olerud,

20:48.615 --> 20:49.616
electronics geek.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.483
All right, well, let's say

20:50.517 --> 20:52.685
Nash has put together
a reunion tour

20:52.719 --> 20:54.654
and he's targeting
the exercises.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.488
That still doesn't
tell me why

20:55.522 --> 20:56.956
he's going after
Homeland Security.

20:56.989 --> 20:57.857
This might.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.626
Nash has been working
as a contractor

20:59.659 --> 21:01.928
in Iraq this last year,
and the base he was

21:01.961 --> 21:03.696
working out of was
supposed to be secure,

21:03.730 --> 21:04.931
but it wasn't.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.499
In April they were hit
by suicide bombers

21:06.533 --> 21:08.335
and he lost two of the men
on his team.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.669
DAVID:
But how is that connected

21:09.702 --> 21:11.438
to Homeland Security,
though?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.973
Because the same lapses
in security that he saw there

21:14.006 --> 21:14.974
he sees here now.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.044
My guess is he's decided
to call attention to it.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.480
How? By gassing the subway?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.948
In his mind, he's found

21:21.981 --> 21:25.952
a way to exert control over
a situation he was helpless in.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.020
Emotions aren't rational,
Grangar.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.856
Revenge is just an emotion.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.427
I checked the background.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.863
Nash's CT team fell
off the grid after Mirabo;

21:36.896 --> 21:38.631
cell phones,
bank statements,

21:38.665 --> 21:40.032
credit cards,
it all stopped dead.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.601
But wait.
He had a sister, right?

21:41.634 --> 21:44.337
Who said she doesn't
know where he is.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.605
Let's get her
on surveillance.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.939
I mean, if we don'
find him, he's going to

21:46.973 --> 21:49.041
- find us, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.543
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.112
Master plans for
the remaining exercises.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.715
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.716
I appreciate it.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.085
I think you should
take a look at this first.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.055
Our department keeps records
of all threats made

22:03.089 --> 22:05.758
against Homeland Security
personnel or operations.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.628
Nash, he sent letters
making a lot of noise

22:08.661 --> 22:10.096
about how easy
it would be

22:10.129 --> 22:12.399
to trash Houseman's
anti-terror drills.

22:12.432 --> 22:17.003
I'd appreciate it if you don't
tell Houseman I gave you that.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.038
Yeah, absolutely.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.373
But why didn't he
give it to us?

22:20.407 --> 22:21.941
He doesn't like
to respond

22:21.974 --> 22:22.942
to what he calls
idle threats.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.645
I'm glad you don't agree.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.014
I did my time in the army,
first Gulf War.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.450
I've met men like Nash,
Special Forces.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.918
My experience?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.654
They don't bark
unless they intend to bite.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.862
( knocking )

22:46.933 --> 22:50.603
Oh, a new algorithmic
mapping system?

22:50.637 --> 22:52.872
Mm. It's a seating map
for the wedding.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.808
My dad finally found me
a job I can help him with

22:55.842 --> 22:57.510
that's interesting
mathematically.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.980
Yeah? Well, it seems
just a little elaborate.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.882
Well, it is a complicated
series of evaluations;

23:02.915 --> 23:06.519
dynamic traffic flow, graph
analysis, acoustic patterning.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.621
Okay. You know,
I tell you, none of this

23:08.655 --> 23:10.056
explains why I always
get stuck

23:10.089 --> 23:11.057
sitting between
the great aunts

23:11.090 --> 23:12.759
and the cigar-smoking
cousins.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.596
Oh, diversions aside,
this case I'm working on

23:16.629 --> 23:17.797
is presenting some difficulties.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.732
Anything you hope
to discern?

23:19.766 --> 23:22.101
The pattern in Glen Nash's
past acts

23:22.134 --> 23:25.137
are key to his
target selection.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.673
Yeah? Anything else
going on with you?

23:26.706 --> 23:28.107
Hmm?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.776
It's just the other day,
you know,

23:29.809 --> 23:32.512
your father recalled
the amusing anecdote

23:32.545 --> 23:35.014
of you and Don
fighting over the girl.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.516
Yeah. What about it?

23:36.549 --> 23:37.684
It's just that, you know,

23:37.717 --> 23:39.519
you didn't seem
all that amused.

23:39.552 --> 23:44.056
There's some stuff between Don
and me that's not worked out.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.958
Have you talked
to him about that yet?

23:45.992 --> 23:47.660
No. It was high school.

23:47.694 --> 23:51.063
Well, you know, sometimes,
the path to closure

23:51.097 --> 23:51.964
is as elusive

23:51.998 --> 23:55.502
as the path from row three
to row six.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.504
It's certainly not as simple
as it appears.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.771
People always desire

23:58.805 --> 23:59.806
to have the best seat
in the house,

23:59.839 --> 24:01.774
which is the row directly
behind the families,

24:01.808 --> 24:04.977
but no matter
how you map it out,

24:05.011 --> 24:07.013
there's always going
to be some seats,

24:07.046 --> 24:09.048
some targets...

24:09.081 --> 24:11.183
harder to get to
than others.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.667
That's the commonality.

24:27.700 --> 24:31.838
Out of 30 CT team operations,
all were against military bases

24:31.871 --> 24:33.172
and high security labs.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.274
But I know that
in the military,

24:35.307 --> 24:38.077
CT teams often choose
their own assignments.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.913
It seems like Glen Nash made
a point of choosing

24:40.947 --> 24:43.082
the most
unassailable targets.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.717
Well, there's your pattern.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.756
Megan, we ran an
employment check

24:49.789 --> 24:51.157
on Nash's former team.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.324
Prior to Mirabo Labs,

24:52.358 --> 24:55.595
Holstein, Small and Olerud
all worked jobs in construction,

24:55.628 --> 24:58.197
home-building supply
and electronics wholesale.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.365
That doesn't track.

24:59.398 --> 25:02.201
Cowboys like this don't take
ten-dollar-an-hour McJobs.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.604
These Special Forces guys
are trained to live off the land

25:04.637 --> 25:06.172
and make use
of what's readily available.

25:06.205 --> 25:10.276
Like turning a convenience store
item like a cafe latte can

25:10.309 --> 25:11.277
into a chemical bomb.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.013
We figure maybe these guys
helped themselves

25:14.046 --> 25:16.115
to some phosgene gas when they
were working at the labs.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.283
Could be they chose
the other worksites

25:17.316 --> 25:18.951
for whatever else
they needed to steal.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.554
We should talk to
their former employers,

25:21.588 --> 25:23.189
- see what else went missing.
- Hey, where's Don?

25:23.222 --> 25:24.256
He's with the Homeland
Security guys

25:24.290 --> 25:25.391
in the conference room.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.660
Great, 'cause I think
I may have an answer for them.

25:27.694 --> 25:32.164
After the first World Trade
Center attack in 1993,

25:32.198 --> 25:35.101
mathematicians at the NSA
tried to predict

25:35.134 --> 25:38.037
other attacks by evaluating
likely target choices

25:38.070 --> 25:40.072
using a linear discriminant
analysis.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.574
Agent Eppes,

25:41.608 --> 25:43.876
am I here for
a math lecture

25:43.910 --> 25:45.878
or a substantive discussion of
the problem at hand?

25:45.912 --> 25:47.179
Well, how about both,
Mr. Houseman?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.982
Based on past acts,

25:50.016 --> 25:54.253
I've deduced that Glen Nash

25:54.286 --> 25:55.888
doesn't just prefer
hard targets,

25:55.922 --> 25:57.757
he goes for the hardest.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.325
The greatest security
challenges.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.292
Given this fact,

26:00.326 --> 26:02.695
I've applied my Linear
Discrminant Analysis

26:02.729 --> 26:05.297
to the ten remaining exercises.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.332
And I've calculated
threat assessments based on

26:06.365 --> 26:09.268
a series of variables:

26:09.301 --> 26:12.171
number of ingresses, egresses,
number of security cameras,

26:12.204 --> 26:15.975
police presence, proximity
to the freeway and so on.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.644
Now, from these variables,

26:17.677 --> 26:20.212
I've rated the targets
from softest to hardest,

26:20.246 --> 26:25.785
and I believe that Nash's next
target is City Hall.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.820
We have an exercise there
tomorrow, 9:00 A.M.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.321
So that gives us, what,
like, 11 hours.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.691
Well, that's enough time
to run Nash's MO

26:31.724 --> 26:33.726
through my Psych Percolation
Theory Algorithm,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.194
and that may tell us
how he'll attack.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.930
We have a breach at
the Homeland Security office.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.337
( garbled radio transmission)

26:45.371 --> 26:47.674
TERRY:
It doesn't make any sense.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.275
The Homeland Security
office isn't a hard target,

26:49.308 --> 26:51.778
and to strike two days
before a scheduled exercise

26:51.811 --> 26:53.646
breaks Nash's MO.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.114
Maybe he's telling us
we're on his schedule now.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.148
Nothing was missing.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.316
Security says no.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.351
COLBY: Is it possible they're
trying to download plans

26:59.385 --> 27:01.954
for the exercises and trigger
the alarm that way?

27:01.988 --> 27:04.824
Tech guys say the firewall
hasn't been breached.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.226
I want every inch of this
building searched again.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.828
No one has entered, Peter.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.030
Every inch, James.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.234
And your guys didn't
get anything

27:15.267 --> 27:16.302
off of these video cameras?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.970
Or the motion
detectors.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.672
So nobody actually made entry.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.240
But they want us

27:21.273 --> 27:22.408
to believe they did.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.010
Why would Nash want
to trigger an alarm

27:24.043 --> 27:25.444
if his team never entered?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.313
It's not a game if there's
no objective, right?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.281
Right.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.850
So tripping the alarm
accomplished what?

27:30.883 --> 27:33.085
Well, it brought us
all here.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.021
Nash is trained
in cyberwarfare.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.088
He hacked into their system,
right?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.990
But why? What's the point?

27:38.024 --> 27:40.326
What if we're the point?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.795
If he can hack into their
security system,

27:42.829 --> 27:44.396
why couldn't he hack
into their video surveillance?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.265
They're both on
the same circuit.

27:46.298 --> 27:52.371
TERRY: So he's watching us
through those cameras.

27:52.404 --> 27:56.142
DAVID: Okay, he's watching
us do what?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.778
He's watching us respond.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.047
It's counter-surveillance.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.061
The guy goes through
the trouble,

28:15.094 --> 28:16.763
but why not just steal
Houseman's security plans

28:16.796 --> 28:18.330
for the rest
of the exercises?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.366
Because then Houseman
might cancel them.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.034
Our boy Nash wants
to make sure

28:22.068 --> 28:23.302
those exercises
stay in play.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.336
- As a target.
- Uh-huh.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.504
Okay, thank you.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.907
Hey, I just checked those other
jobs that Nash's guys had.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.909
You were exactly right, there's
a bunch of stuff missing.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.510
Blasting caps from a
construction site,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.179
a pesticide called Cordex
missing from

28:33.212 --> 28:34.747
a home supply store.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.983
A bunch of cell phones
from the electronics shop.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.319
Palestinian suicide terrorists,
they use Cordex

28:40.352 --> 28:41.153
to mix with explosives.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.189
Plus blasting caps
and cell phones.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.391
Nash is making a bomb.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.396
DON: We're talking about
concrete evidence

28:50.429 --> 28:52.799
that Nash and his men
have an explosive device.

28:52.832 --> 28:53.933
TERRY:
Any my psych workups

28:53.966 --> 28:56.502
indicate that he's getting tired
of sending you messages

28:56.535 --> 28:57.703
you don't listen to.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.538
If we stop the exercise, we're
giving him what he wants.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.841
And you don't and you are
literally daring him

29:01.874 --> 29:04.777
to cause real casualties.

29:04.811 --> 29:07.213
I think we should listen
to what they say, Peter.

29:07.246 --> 29:11.450
All right.
We postpone the exercises

29:11.483 --> 29:14.153
until you get Nash.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.521
Tell our people
to stand down.

29:20.126 --> 29:23.462
That went a lot easier
than I thought it would.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.832
You don't think a bomb going off
is enough of a motivator?

29:25.865 --> 29:27.233
What part of
his personality says

29:27.266 --> 29:28.400
he can take
a suggestion?

29:28.434 --> 29:32.571
Okay, well, what's changed
since the last time we saw him?

29:32.604 --> 29:35.007
The break-in
at Homeland Security.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.275
He seemed pretty rattled.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.143
Which we assumed

29:37.176 --> 29:39.111
was because Nash hit him
where he lived.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.580
Think something
else scared him?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.415
Maybe.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.258
Hey.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.359
Hey, brother.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.526
- What's up?
- Dad's lasagna.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.561
It's actually worth
digesting.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.129
Why don't you grab
a plate?

29:57.163 --> 29:58.497
I'm good, thanks.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.933
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.068
What do you got there?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.469
What is it, high school
yearbook? No way.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.938
Yeah.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.539
I don't remember you
being next to Val.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.176
Yeah, Val Eng,
Charlie Eppes.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.443
I thought it was part
of a greater plan.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.945
What? I ruined that?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.046
What's your quote here?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.983
"Eternal nothingness
is okay if you dress for it."

30:17.016 --> 30:18.517
Oh, yeah, Woody Allen.
That's good.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.053
I don't remember you
being all that funny.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.222
Oh, and yeah, you were
hilarious, right?

30:23.255 --> 30:27.393
Man, I totally didn't get you.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.129
We totally didn't get
each other, did we?

30:30.162 --> 30:32.899
No, negative.

30:32.932 --> 30:36.102
We could have never done this
work together as kids.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.469
No way.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.006
BOTH:
Can you imagine that?

30:40.039 --> 30:43.509
We're doing all right now,
right?

30:46.345 --> 30:50.282
Somehow, yeah.
We're doing all right.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.520
Charlie, look, you know,

30:54.553 --> 30:57.589
if I did stuff that hurt you
when we were kids...

30:59.658 --> 31:01.928
I'm sorry.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.063
Thank you.
You don't have to...

31:04.096 --> 31:05.197
I was 13.

31:05.231 --> 31:08.935
Yeah, exactly.
You were 13.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.106
She was, she was so hot.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.207
She's still hot, man.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.608
And just think how happy
Dad would be

31:16.642 --> 31:18.377
if one of us
married a doctor.

31:18.410 --> 31:22.114
I think he'd be happy if I
married someone with a pulse.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.083
Nice point.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.553
Hey, listen, so
something Larry said

31:27.586 --> 31:28.787
got me thinking
about the targets.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.423
Yeah, it doesn't matter 'cause
they canceled the exercises.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.559
We're going to have
to catch Nash the hard way.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.593
That's just it.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.063
I'm not so sure
the exercises were the target.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.464
What do you mean?

31:38.497 --> 31:40.599
Come on, bro,
I'll show you.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.602
So I based my
Linear Discriminant Analysis

31:43.635 --> 31:45.204
on Nash's past operations

31:45.237 --> 31:47.573
which yielded a preference
for hard targets:

31:47.606 --> 31:49.675
missile silos, and
battle command labs.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.144
Right. Which is why you thought
he'd strike City Hall.

31:52.178 --> 31:55.647
But in focusing
on Nash's patterns of behavior,

31:55.681 --> 31:57.583
I overlooked something.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.152
The subway, the office
of Homeland Security--

32:00.186 --> 32:01.687
those are soft targets.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.256
Which don't fit his MO.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.392
So we've either been
looking at the wrong guy--

32:06.425 --> 32:08.660
Or the wrong targets.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.304
TERRY:
Morning.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.438
Good morning.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.340
Tape from the Homeland
Security office.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.243
Yeah, I'm trying to see
what Nash was seeing.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.645
He's watching us.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.615
Right. That's us,
but watch Houseman.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.450
He's checking out
his laptop.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.486
DON:
Look at his face.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.288
Yeah, okay.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.624
I see the eyes, the
jaw, the tension.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.126
Something on that
screen scared him.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.028
DON: What if Nash
wasn't just

32:42.061 --> 32:43.095
hacking into
their security system--

32:43.129 --> 32:45.697
what if he was hacking
into Houseman's computer?

32:45.731 --> 32:48.534
So he wasn't watching us,
he's watching Houseman.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.037
Whatever message he sent was
received loud and clear.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.073
Wait, back up.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.713
- A little more resolution.
- Yeah.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.584
Whoa.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.087
"K-I-A," that's
"killed in action."

33:08.120 --> 33:08.954
He's talking about

33:08.987 --> 33:09.788
the American troops
killed in Iraq.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.090
All right, call
Homeland Security.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.058
Get a bomb squad over there.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.259
Tell Houseman he's going

33:13.292 --> 33:16.262
into protective custody, and
that's willingly or unwillingly.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.496
See, Charlie
thought the exercises

33:17.529 --> 33:19.065
weren't Nash's
prime target.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.167
So he's going after
Houseman, not the drills.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.235
Houseman didn't show up
for work this morning.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.771
They've been trying
to find him all day.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.673
Surveillance just saw Nash
go into his sister's house.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.241
All right, let's get over there.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.524
MEGAN:
There is our guy.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.493
All right,
we go on my command.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.660
Just hold.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.165
Nash's sister.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.766
All right, you two
deal with her.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.068
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

33:58.337 --> 34:01.707
Ms. Nash. Ms. Nash!
Come with me.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.796
FBI! FBI!

34:24.830 --> 34:26.198
Hey! Who called 911?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.167
Get your hands up.
Get 'em up!

34:28.200 --> 34:30.469
All right,
just stay cool, partner

34:30.502 --> 34:32.138
Everything's gonna
be all right.

34:32.171 --> 34:32.838
One more step,
I'm gonna put

34:32.871 --> 34:33.839
a hole right
through you!

34:33.872 --> 34:36.442
Step away from the door,
step away from the door.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.210
Get down on
your knees.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.278
Down on your knees!

34:39.311 --> 34:40.279
Hands on your head.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.780
Check it out.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.749
Get 'em on your head!

34:45.584 --> 34:47.153
Most people use

34:47.186 --> 34:49.155
a pot rack to hang pots.

34:49.188 --> 34:49.788
Where's Houseman?

34:49.821 --> 34:50.822
Who?

34:50.856 --> 34:52.358
Where's the bomb?

34:52.391 --> 34:53.225
( snorts )

34:53.259 --> 34:55.194
You're sure asking
a lot of questions

34:55.227 --> 34:56.195
for someone who's trying
to make me think

34:56.228 --> 34:57.163
you got all the answers.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.231
Look, pal, you don't want
to mess with me.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.632
It's over.
I'm your only hope.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.368
It's never over, Agent,

35:02.401 --> 35:04.536
not until
the last man standing.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.608
Hate to pee in your corn flakes,

35:09.641 --> 35:11.310
but I don't know
where Houseman is.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.312
I got nothing to do with this.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.415
You had nothing to do with
threats against the exercises?

35:16.448 --> 35:17.516
Freedom of speech.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.918
I spent my adult life
defending the Constitution,

35:19.951 --> 35:22.454
I figure I'm entitled
to use an amendment or two.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.755
Hey, come on,
don't cloak this

35:23.789 --> 35:24.723
in the Constitution.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.593
This is about your men
dying in Iraq, isn't it?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.495
We pulled background
checks on the Homeland

35:29.528 --> 35:30.596
Security personnel.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.798
You know that Houseman did
a consulting gig in Iraq

35:32.831 --> 35:34.466
before he worked
for the department.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.867
It was his team
who drew up

35:35.901 --> 35:37.769
the security plans
for the airbase

35:37.803 --> 35:39.205
where your team members
were killed.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.607
Made a lot of money
doing it, too.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.941
DON:
You sent a letter

35:42.974 --> 35:44.376
to the Pentagon--
they didn't listen.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.645
Boy, I'll bet that
pissed you off, huh?

35:46.678 --> 35:48.547
So you found another
way to be heard?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.217
Did you ask your team
to steal phosgene gas

35:51.250 --> 35:52.718
from Mirabo Labs?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.487
The same gas that was
used in the subway.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.628
Hey, if that happened,

36:02.661 --> 36:04.596
it wasn't under my order.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.931
Oh, all of a sudden
you weren't in charge.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.733
Now, why do I have
a hard time believing that?

36:07.766 --> 36:10.869
After the Mirabo job,
we all went our separate ways.

36:10.902 --> 36:11.837
I want to know where
they are, I want to know

36:11.870 --> 36:13.905
where the bomb is, and
I want to know where

36:13.939 --> 36:15.607
Houseman is, and that's
your only shot at a deal,

36:15.641 --> 36:16.975
you hear me?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.611
If I were in charge
of this operation,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.380
we wouldn't even
be having this discussion

36:21.413 --> 36:24.650
because there's no way
in hell a bunch of Feds

36:24.683 --> 36:29.688
would've ever caught me, pants
down, at my sister's house.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.790
I'm not that stupid.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.765
We just talked to Nash's sister.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.767
He hasn't even been in the
country for the last four weeks.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.001
Where was he?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.736
He's been in Mexico
in drug rehab.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.273
I guess after what happened
in Iraq, he started using.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.840
The rehab clinic
confirmed

36:48.874 --> 36:50.676
Nash has been there
this entire month.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.977
Yeah. Iraq
messed him up,

36:52.010 --> 36:54.012
just not the way
we thought.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.014
All right, so
if not him, then who,

36:56.047 --> 36:57.649
and, and why
are they after Houseman?

36:57.683 --> 36:58.750
This Army file
may have the answer.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.386
I just got to thinking,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.521
suspect on a silver platter?a

37:02.554 --> 37:03.889
Houseman's number two.
( phone ringing )

37:03.922 --> 37:04.990
Eppes.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.793
guy who lost men.ly ex-Army

37:07.826 --> 37:09.861
Different Iraq war,
same story.

37:09.895 --> 37:10.862
On our way.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.863
Houseman was
just spotted.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.731
Where?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.900
Homeland Security
with James Grace.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.639
You sure Security's right?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.941
There's no good reason
for Grace to be on the roof.

37:32.984 --> 37:33.885
Okay, guys, I got him.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.894
Grace, get your hands up.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.563
I don't think so.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.564
Get 'em up where I can see 'em!

37:45.597 --> 37:46.498
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.868
I wouldn't get any closer
if I were you.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.671
I got him on speed-dial.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.675
All right, we're going
to need a bomb squad

37:56.708 --> 37:57.976
and we gotta set
up a perimeter.

37:58.009 --> 37:58.910
Aren't we in it?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.813
We need a perimeter
around the building.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.082
- Roger that.omb on the roof.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.418
We've pulled your file,
Major Grace.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.821
You were Special
Forces yourself. Like Nash.

38:09.855 --> 38:10.889
Him and his team

38:10.922 --> 38:12.391
served under you.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.592
All those men
were great men.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.960
Is that how you're
gonna make your point?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.227
You're gonna blow up
a bunch of FBI agents?

38:16.261 --> 38:18.997
There's only one person here
that deserves a body bag-- him.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.932
James, what the hell
did I ever do to you?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.100
To me?

38:22.133 --> 38:25.036
Nothing, but
those men in Iraq...

38:25.070 --> 38:27.038
You let them think
they were secure...

38:27.072 --> 38:30.609
and you're doing
the same thing now, here.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.844
I'm just trying to protect
lives, the same as you.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.847
How? By staging these drills?

38:35.881 --> 38:36.915
Everything's pre-planned,

38:36.948 --> 38:39.084
guaranteed for success?

38:39.117 --> 38:41.853
You want a real
exercise, Peter?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.756
One with real risk?

38:44.790 --> 38:46.392
You got one, right now.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.959
That's what this is,
isn't it, Major?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.562
An exercise.

38:50.596 --> 38:53.532
I want him to feel what those
men felt in Iraq...

38:53.565 --> 38:54.433
for real.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.934
Then you've
accomplished your mission.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.369
Let him go.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.071
That bomb's not real, is it?

39:00.105 --> 39:04.009
You think I would dishonor the
men that fight for this country

39:04.042 --> 39:08.580
by killing a defenseless
man like him?

39:08.614 --> 39:10.382
All right, relax.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.918
- We're coming in.
- What?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.059
Yeah, feel it,
Peter. Feel it.

39:25.664 --> 39:26.164
( mutters nervously )

39:26.197 --> 39:28.567
( yells )

39:34.806 --> 39:36.608
Like I said...

39:36.642 --> 39:39.878
it was just an exercise.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.180
Yeah, I hope it
was it worth it.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.750
If it gets the message
through to people like him?

39:44.783 --> 39:46.952
Absolutely.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.427
( string trio playing )

40:11.643 --> 40:12.711
Can I just
adjust your tie?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.112
You're acting like
I'm getting married.

40:14.145 --> 40:14.946
Boys, boys.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.582
How do you like
the flowers, hmm?

40:16.615 --> 40:17.749
It's great, yeah.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.552
I was thinking of getting
potted kumquats, but, uh...

40:20.586 --> 40:22.688
Dad, whatever you did,
the place looks beautiful.

40:22.721 --> 40:23.889
DON:
Absolutely. Good job.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.123
CHARLIE:
You throw a great, wedding.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.224
Remember that,
both of you.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.225
Oh, here we go.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.494
Mr. Eppes?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.462
I just wanted to thank you.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.563
No, it's Alan,

40:31.597 --> 40:33.131
and you look
absolutely lovely.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.032
- Well thank you!
- Huh?

40:34.065 --> 40:36.201
Well, now...

40:36.234 --> 40:37.636
It's a beautiful bride.

40:37.669 --> 40:38.537
So where's the groom?

40:38.570 --> 40:39.838
Uh... oh, Ben's over there.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.042
I better get back inside

40:44.075 --> 40:46.044
before he sees me.
Catch up with you after?

40:46.077 --> 40:47.112
Hey, congratulations.

40:47.145 --> 40:47.779
Yeah.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.781
Thank you.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.016
He's a doctor, too.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.250
So am I, Dad.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.919
That's what I meant.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.554
Are you Charlie Eppes?

40:55.587 --> 40:58.023
Sure, why not?

40:58.056 --> 41:00.692
I'm Bree.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.227
Bree Eng?

41:02.260 --> 41:04.630
You're Val's cousin.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.064
Right.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.099
Wow, you were so...
so little.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.768
I'm not so little
anymore.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.070
I was looking for an escort.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.040
Uh... Sorry.
Groom side.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.142
Lead on.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.109
Okay.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.513
Your cousin looks beautiful.

41:21.547 --> 41:24.983
Thanks. I know, I was there.

41:27.653 --> 41:28.887
This one.

41:28.920 --> 41:32.090
Thanks. It was very nice
to meet you.

41:32.123 --> 41:35.627
Kid's gotta learn how to close.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.162
Yeah, that's what
he needs, a seminar

41:37.195 --> 41:38.296
from the dateless wonder.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.131
I don't see you
with a date, pal.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.601
Who says I don't
have a date?

41:45.103 --> 41:46.538
The caterer?

41:46.572 --> 41:47.573
- Yes, the caterer.
- Nice.

41:47.606 --> 41:48.640
She has a daughter, too.

41:48.674 --> 41:49.641
She's very cute.

41:49.675 --> 41:50.909
I can take care
of myself.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.711
Take a look.
There she is.

41:57.749 --> 41:58.850
Oh, that's
her daughter?

41:58.884 --> 42:00.051
Yes.

42:00.085 --> 42:03.789
Oh... See, that's
food for thought.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.523
She's cute.
