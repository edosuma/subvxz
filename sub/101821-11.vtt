00:01.543 --> 00:04.587
punchy music

00:07.465 --> 00:09.259
How the hell'd
you get in here?

00:09.300 --> 00:10.510
Hey, I'm not gonna tell you

00:10.552 --> 00:12.721
what happened last week
on  Shameless,  all right?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.681
Go look it up
on goddamn Wikipedia.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.932
I don't want you
to sell the house.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.018
Me, Ian, Carl, Liam--
we're movin' out.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.394
I want Franny
to have what I had.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.062
I want her to grow up
with family.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.064
How about this one?
It's got a heated pool,

00:23.106 --> 00:25.150
-gym, garden.
-[Mickey] It's on the fuckin'

00:25.191 --> 00:26.526
-West Side.
-[Ian]  Can we just talk

00:26.568 --> 00:28.695
to the lady,
take a look at the lease?

00:28.737 --> 00:30.238
I'm not moving here.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.322
Signed the lease.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.783
-You did what?
-It'll be good for us, Mick.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.036
-[crowd chanting]
-[Carl] Hey, who's that?

00:36.077 --> 00:38.121
The landlord. He's the guy
who called this in.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.914
Need you to step out
the vehicle, sir.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.167
-Ha ha ha. What?
-I said,

00:42.208 --> 00:43.418
-step out of the vehicle!
-Whoa!

00:43.460 --> 00:45.378
Hey, you gotta be kidding me.
Hey, get off of me, man!

00:45.420 --> 00:47.464
I'm arresting you for
assaulting a police officer.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.300
You and your fancy S-Class
and shiny shoes

00:50.341 --> 00:52.385
are goin' down!

00:52.427 --> 00:53.803
[Ian]  Kev and V
are still in Louisville

00:53.845 --> 00:54.929
helping V's mom settle in.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.473
I accidentally
got a bartending job.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.475
I maybe got offered
a job today, too.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.519
We should sell the Alibi,
move down here, and make bank.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.979
If you weren't all
Mr. Fuckin' Fix It,

01:03.021 --> 01:04.564
I wouldn't be movin'
to the goddamn West Side.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.025
What the fuck are you gonna do?

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
Mama's really gonna miss
her family.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.781
-You have dementia.
-Have you all talked about

01:12.822 --> 01:14.240
what to do with me
when it gets bad?

01:14.282 --> 01:18.244
[Liam]  No. But it'll probably
be up to me to figure it out.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.288
Who else is gonna do it?
They all hate you.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.623
Right.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.083
[Frank]
Don't look so glum, kid.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.709
Everybody dies sooner or later.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.919
I lived a good life.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.921
I got to live it my way.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.255
[Liam] What do you think?

01:29.297 --> 01:31.424
[Frank]  It's perfect.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.726
rock music

01:45.480 --> 01:48.608
Think of all
the luck you got

01:48.650 --> 01:51.903
Know that
it's not for naught

01:51.945 --> 01:54.948
You were beaming
once before

01:54.989 --> 01:59.410
But it's not like that
anymore

01:59.452 --> 02:02.914
What is this downside

02:02.956 --> 02:06.334
That you speak of?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.294
What is this feeling

02:08.336 --> 02:13.383
You're so sure of?

02:19.639 --> 02:23.309
Round up
the friends you got

02:23.351 --> 02:26.271
Know that
they're not for naught

02:26.312 --> 02:29.357
You were willing
once before

02:29.399 --> 02:34.028
But it's not like that
anymore

02:34.070 --> 02:37.240
What is this downside

02:37.282 --> 02:40.618
That you speak of?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.787
What is this feeling

02:42.829 --> 02:47.000
You're so sure of?

02:55.758 --> 02:56.926
[sighs]

02:56.968 --> 02:58.803
[whispers] Shit.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.454
[tires screeching]

03:24.495 --> 03:26.581
[Mickey sighs]

03:26.623 --> 03:30.084
[gunshots, sirens wailing]

03:30.126 --> 03:32.378
[tires screeching,
siren wailing]

03:32.420 --> 03:34.881
[gunshot]

03:38.301 --> 03:41.346
[siren wailing, gunfire]

03:41.387 --> 03:42.513
[Mickey exhales]

03:42.555 --> 03:45.058
-Stupid fuckin' moon.
-[tires screeching]

03:45.099 --> 03:47.727

03:49.145 --> 03:52.190
punchy pop music

03:54.192 --> 03:56.361
-[indistinct chatter]
-[waiter] Last call, guys.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.238
[customer] Another round
of appletinis, please.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.323
I got one, two,
99 problems

04:00.365 --> 04:02.033
And the cig in my hand,
it ain't one

04:02.075 --> 04:03.451
[woman] Give me your keys
or at least call an Uber.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.828
[man] I'm good, I'm goo--
I'm fine.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.497
[clerk] Yeah, gluten-free.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.624
[woman] Oh, for health.
They smell really good, right?

04:09.666 --> 04:12.168
A glimpse of the climate
change getting warm

04:12.210 --> 04:14.879
[woman] Bars are closing.
Let's go have an afterparty.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.382
[woman]
Okay. All right.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.133
Fuckin' West Side.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.011
Antoinette, sweet Marie

04:22.053 --> 04:24.514
Chop it off,
squeaky clean...

04:24.555 --> 04:26.599
[door closes]

04:26.641 --> 04:29.102
Down below, buried deep

04:29.143 --> 04:31.604
Let me go, set me free

04:31.646 --> 04:34.232
Body's strong,
but mentally

04:34.274 --> 04:36.526
Lost my mind, guillotine

04:38.111 --> 04:40.029
Hey.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.072
[Lip] Hey.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.575
Lost my mind, guillotine

04:44.617 --> 04:47.704
-Thought you moved out.
-Go fuck yourself.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.254
Lost my mind, guillotine

04:59.340 --> 05:01.467
[snoring]

05:05.972 --> 05:07.890
[alarms blaring,
sirens wailing]

05:07.932 --> 05:11.561
[man shouting indistinctly]

05:11.602 --> 05:13.271
[exhales sharply]

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148

05:15.189 --> 05:19.152
[car alarm blaring]

05:19.986 --> 05:23.197
[tool whirring loudly]

05:26.868 --> 05:28.202
-Mornin'.
-[Lip] Hey.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.163
You stay up all night again?

05:30.204 --> 05:32.165
Indeed, I have, Officer.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.418
[Carl] Yeah, I'm an officer,
but what does that even mean?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.503
All I see is lazy cops
who do nothing

05:37.545 --> 05:40.173
or hard-ass cops who don't give
a shit about the community.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.675
It's like I don't wanna be
either one of those,

05:42.717 --> 05:44.052
so what's the point?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.261
What?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.263
-Nothing. Never mind.
-No, no.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.890
Look, I'm sorry, man,
I do, I wanna listen to you,

05:48.931 --> 05:50.224
but could we do it
another time?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.226
My brain can't switch gears
right now.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.686
-[hammer thudding]
-That's fine.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.813
Jesus--loud!
Early!

05:55.855 --> 05:57.857
Yeah, well, I gotta try
and get this finished.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.567
I wanna list the house
by the end of the week.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.362
[Debbie] Great. Can't wait
to get kicked out soon.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.615
[sighs] We still having
this conversation?

06:05.656 --> 06:07.617
Are you still uprooting
my daughter and I

06:07.658 --> 06:09.243
from the only home
we've ever known?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.787
No, No. I'm selling our home

06:10.828 --> 06:12.372
so everybody
can have a nest egg

06:12.413 --> 06:13.581
and buy their own homes.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.416
[sighs] Whatever.
I'll still be all alone.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.877
Then go find somebody
to be with.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
It's not that easy!
I suck at relationships.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.256
I can't take care of you
anymore, Debs.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.092
Of course not.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.511
Look, I got my own family
to worry about.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.554
-So do I!
-We're adults now, okay?

06:28.596 --> 06:31.224
This is what adults do.
They move on, all right?

06:31.265 --> 06:35.019
Guess I'll go off and find some
random old person to marry.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.062
-You should do that.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.731
-I'll be out of your hair
soon enough--don't worry.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.526
-[hammer thuds]
-[whispers] Fuck.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.571
[wood clattering loudly]

06:49.409 --> 06:52.954
[hammer thudding,
wood clatters]

06:52.995 --> 06:56.582
[sniffing]

07:02.213 --> 07:04.340
Ohh--gross!

07:04.382 --> 07:07.218
Ew! Ass fuck.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.845
You shit yourself, Frank.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.597
What the fuck?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.359
-[Liam] Frank.
-I just shat the bed

07:23.401 --> 07:24.610
and pissed myself.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.863
-Ew!
-I'm lost.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.614
Spent. Used up.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.992
-You're just being dramatic.
-I'm hopelessly wandering

07:31.033 --> 07:32.869
in a world I don't recognize.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.162
[Liam] It's just
a bad morning for you.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.788
Happens to the best of them.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.874
What are you doing today?

07:37.915 --> 07:40.042
Uh...nothing.

07:40.084 --> 07:42.295
[Liam] Me neither.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.505
Let's have some fun.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.425
-I don't feel like it.
-Come on.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.676
It's like you used to
always tell me.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.262
Either you run the day,
or the day runs you.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.430
I said that?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.223
[sighs] Just get in the shower.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.559
We're gonna do
some Frank things.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.603
Frank things?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.645
Yeah.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.106
Drinking, scamming--
you know, Frank things.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.983
Okay.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.330
[rustling]

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
[Ian] Hey, morning.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.086
[Mickey] Hey.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.421
[Ian]
Where you been?

08:25.463 --> 08:29.050
I, uh, just woke up early,
went for a walk.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.343
[Ian] Oh.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.554
I slept great last night.
You?

08:33.596 --> 08:36.474
The moon's really fuckin'
bright over here.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.728
I'm pretty sure
it's the same everywhere.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.271
I...guess so.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.773
[bag rustling]

08:43.814 --> 08:45.900
You wanna check out
the amenities in this place?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.069
I'm gonna get
some laundry done.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.404
Sure you don't wanna
hit up the gym...

08:50.446 --> 08:52.907
go for a little dip
in the pool after?

08:52.949 --> 08:54.408
No. I wanna check to see

08:54.450 --> 08:57.036
when our furniture's
gettin' here.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.622
Meet up after, then.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.251
Yeah, sure.
Not goin' anywhere.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.378
Okay. Yeah, good.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.423
I'm glad we rented this place.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.055
-[Arthur] Carl, morning.
-[Carl] Arthur.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.598
Beiser's husband
made pound cake.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.350
It's in the break room.
Grab some before it's gone.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.269
Or I could just eat
the crumbs off your vest.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.979
Mm? Oopsy-doopsy.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.106
Got a dog at home, eats up
all the crumbs on the floor.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.524
Know what we call her?

09:26.566 --> 09:27.650
Um...Hoover?

09:27.692 --> 09:29.694
Oh, my God, that would
have been genius.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.112
No, her name's Millie.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.573
[Stamps] Gallagher.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.742
[Carl] Sergeant Stamps.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.704
Need you to apologize
to Mr. McManus, Carl.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.622
That the guy with
the Merce-Benz?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.457
[Stamps] He's filing a
brutality claim against you.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.418
-Me? What? Why?
-I'm gonna go with

09:45.459 --> 09:47.795
door number two--slamming
the guy against his car.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.255
This can all go away.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.591
Say a few words, "I'm sorry,"
blah, blah, blah.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.092
-[Carl] Seriously?
-Most likely,

09:53.134 --> 09:54.594
he'll drop the claim.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.012
-It'll save the department 50K.
-[Carl] So what?

09:56.053 --> 09:57.555
Every time someone complains,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.265
we just apologize
and it goes away?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.225
If the person's a rich a-hole
with an attorney.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.935
[Stamps chuckles]
Ready?

10:03.936 --> 10:06.939
[Arthur] You got this, Carl.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.735
[Stamps] Mr. McManus,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.903
Officer Gallagher
has something to say to you.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.905
[McManus] Excuse me
if I don't, uh, do a jig.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.199
I got two dislocated discs
in my neck, thanks to you.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.618
I'm very sorry about that, sir.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.412
I was out of line,
and it won't happen again.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.625
Well, I hope we can all
put this behind us.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.085
Officer Gallagher,
you may go back to work now.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.253
[Carl] Thank you, ma'am.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.588
[McManus] That's it?
You're gonna let him

10:30.630 --> 10:34.467
-get off that easily?
-[Stamps] Gallagher, hold up.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.221
I'm a victim here.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.973
[Carl] Yes. Yes, you are, sir.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.601
I was simply double-parked
in front of my building,

10:43.643 --> 10:46.270
and you slammed my body
up against my car.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.605
I'm sorry about that.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.898
[sighs] Well, now I know

10:48.939 --> 10:51.859
how every Black person
in America feels.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.487
[Carl] Did you actually
just say that?

10:54.528 --> 10:56.781
-[McManus] Say what?
-[Carl] That you, a privileged

10:56.822 --> 10:59.575
piece of shit who evicts people
from their apartments

10:59.617 --> 11:00.993
can relate to how
Black people feel,

11:01.035 --> 11:02.036
who are literally murdered

11:02.078 --> 11:03.245
at the hands
of the police department?

11:03.287 --> 11:04.413
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,

11:04.455 --> 11:05.790
-I do relate to them.
-[Carl] No, stop.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.000
I was fine apologizing
to your entitled ass

11:08.042 --> 11:09.502
to make this all go away,

11:09.543 --> 11:11.003
but I can't play this game
anymore.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.255
I spent the last few months
trying to figure out

11:13.297 --> 11:14.548
what kind of cop I wanna be,

11:14.590 --> 11:15.883
and I'll say this,
Sergeant Stamps:

11:15.925 --> 11:17.593
I haven't met a lot of
good role models here.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.345
-Why don't we regroup and--
-But this jagoff

11:19.387 --> 11:21.681
made me realize what
kind of cop I wanna be now.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.307
[Stamps] I'm not sure
you'll have much of a choice

11:23.349 --> 11:25.142
-at this point.
-I wanna be the type a cop

11:25.184 --> 11:27.478
who stands up for those
who don't have a voice--

11:27.520 --> 11:29.105
the lost, the forgotten.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.439
They deserve a fair share,

11:30.481 --> 11:32.358
even if that means rich pricks
like you, Mr. McManus,

11:32.400 --> 11:33.859
have to pay the price

11:33.901 --> 11:36.529
in order to rebalance
the scales of justice.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.364
So, with that being said,

11:38.406 --> 11:39.699
I take my apology back.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.536
[McManus] Mm-hmm.
I'll see you in court, dickwad.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.163
[Stamps, softly] Gallagher.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.374
[Arthur]
Last piece of pound cake!

11:48.416 --> 11:50.418
Goin' once, goin' twice,

11:50.459 --> 11:53.379
sold to Arthur Tipping.

11:53.421 --> 11:57.007
rock music

12:02.054 --> 12:04.598
[indistinct chatter]

12:04.640 --> 12:07.518
[officer] All right.
All the way down.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.730
All the way down.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.440
[officer] Hope I don't see
you here again.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.400
[woman] I ain't never comin'
back to this shithole.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.444
[officer] Then don't try to
kill no more cops or nothin'.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.821
I'll see what I can do
about that.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.157
Really didn't think I was gonna
like it there that much,

12:21.198 --> 12:23.075
but everybody's
so friendly and nice.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
How can Louisville be nice

12:24.493 --> 12:26.495
if they don't even have
pro sports teams?

12:26.537 --> 12:28.122
They have good college B-ball.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
-That doesn't count.
-[Veronica] Kev!

12:30.207 --> 12:31.375
It happened.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.501
Oh, fuck, please don't tell me

12:32.543 --> 12:34.295
that that picture with me
with a turtleneck

12:34.336 --> 12:36.380
-resurfaced on the Internet.
-I don't know about that.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.425
But the money came through,
deposited into our account.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.468
Look.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.469
Holy shit.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.053
-That's a lot of numbers.
-Eighty large!

12:43.095 --> 12:45.222
-How'd ya score that?
-We sold our house.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.100
You got $80,000
for that piece of shit?

12:48.142 --> 12:50.019
Actually, we got $175,000.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.687
-What?
-[Veronica] Yep.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.147
But we had to pay off
the bank loan.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.523
How'd ya sell it so fast?

12:54.565 --> 12:55.900
Developer left us a note
on our door

12:55.941 --> 12:57.193
sayin' she wanted to buy it.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.779
It's official.
We're movin' to Louisville.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.157
Holy shit, it's official.
We're movin' to Louisville.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.492
Are we really doin' this, V?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.285
Of course we're really
doin' it.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.329
-You sellin' the bar, too?
-[Kev] I guess so.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.790
-Absolutely.
-And everything in it, V?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.542
I mean, what about this?
What about Hulu Lamp Girl?

13:13.584 --> 13:14.710
I love her.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.796
You didn't even know
she was here, Kev.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.464
I knew exactly where she--

13:18.506 --> 13:20.716
No! Hulu Lamp Girl!

13:20.758 --> 13:22.551
Hey, you guys.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.054
[Kev] Hey. We sold our house.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.305
Wait. What?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.390
[Tommy] Yeah, they're gonna
become college basketball fans.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.893
[Kev] Hey, Tommy,
don't ever say that again.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.311
We're movin' to Louisville.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.189
No! Why is everybody
leaving me?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.273
Oh, you can come visit.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.777
We're gonna have plenty of room
in our new house.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.071
Why do you guys have
such a good relationship?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.781
-We work on it.
-Sex.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.699
I can't even find a partner.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.036
Kev, what's wrong with me?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.332
Uh...

13:53.374 --> 13:55.376
[mumbling]

13:55.417 --> 13:57.336
Never ask a guy that question.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.380
There is nothin'
wrong with you.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.381
Not true.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.508
Everybody I've ever dated
has treated me like shit.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.844
That's because
you treat yourself like shit.

14:04.885 --> 14:05.886
You have to love yourself

14:05.928 --> 14:07.596
before anyone else
is gonna love you.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.265
Cute.
And total bullshit.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.808
-No, it isn't.
-It is.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.894
That's just what people say
when they can't find a partner.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.523
-[Debbie groans]
-Where are you goin'?

14:17.565 --> 14:21.026
[sighs] Find somebody who can
give me a better answer.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.822
[Frank] Spare some change.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.198
[Liam]
Any little bit will help.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.533
-Please.
-[car horn honks]

14:27.575 --> 14:29.159
Anything will help.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.286
[car horns honking]

14:30.327 --> 14:32.955
-Spare change, please!
-[man] Get out of the street!

14:32.997 --> 14:36.375
Spare change.
Help me feed my family.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.960
[Liam] We're homeless.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.837
Hey, Frank, isn't this is fun?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.631
-[Frank] Yeah.
-[man] Hey!

14:42.673 --> 14:44.216
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

14:44.258 --> 14:46.302
What are you fellas doin'?
Gonna get smushed!

14:46.343 --> 14:49.597
-[Frank] Wait, wh-who is this?
-[Liam] Oh, what's goin' on?

14:49.638 --> 14:51.974
Name's Lester.
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.601
[Frank] Did he say Chester?

14:53.642 --> 14:54.810
[Liam] Lester.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.979
You were out in the middle
of the street.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.565
Here, take this.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.109
Promise me
you'll go home now.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.903
C-can I lead you
in the right direction?

15:03.944 --> 15:07.114
Twenty bucks is not gonna
cut it--we got bills to pay.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.574
How'd ya know it was a 20?

15:08.616 --> 15:09.992
I have a keen sense of--

15:10.034 --> 15:12.745
My father has partial vision
in his left eye.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.915
Come on, son, we gotta
go get some more money.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.167
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!
-[car horn honking]

15:18.208 --> 15:21.253
Aw, jeez.
Here's a hundy.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.381
Is this enough to keep you guys
out of traffic?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.633
Uh...

15:25.674 --> 15:27.551
-yes, it is.
-[Lester] Okay.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.055
Great. Now, please, go home.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.183
upbeat music

15:34.224 --> 15:35.267
Stay safe!

15:35.309 --> 15:38.395
-[horn honking]
-[Frank] Well, that was fun.

15:38.437 --> 15:42.274
Hey, let's go spend some money.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.166
[Ian] How's it goin'?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.085
This treadmill taken?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.544
[man] What?

16:02.586 --> 16:03.712
[Ian] Nothin'.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.090
[quietly] You just go back
to workin'

16:06.131 --> 16:09.969
those ripped, sweaty abs.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.971
Okay, let's see, uh...

16:12.012 --> 16:13.764
cross-country running?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.723
Sure.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.767
Incline...five.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.978
Speed...20?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.647
Okay.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.836
Shit!

16:45.295 --> 16:48.674
Never put the speed higher
than eight on these new ones.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.342
- [panting] Thanks.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.679
Virgin?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.431
Only at fancy treadmills.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.682
[chuckles]

16:56.724 --> 16:58.434
[man] Just move in?

16:58.475 --> 16:59.685
[Ian] I did.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.020
Think you'll like it here.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.355
[Ian] I think I will, too.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.567
upbeat music

17:06.608 --> 17:08.986
Me and my ripped, sweaty abs

17:09.028 --> 17:12.865
will see ya around some time.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.992
Can't hold me back

17:19.872 --> 17:22.958
driving rock music

17:41.393 --> 17:43.437
Shitty-ass moon.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.647
Eh. Looks good.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.951
-[woman] Morning!
-Jesus!

17:57.993 --> 17:59.119
Or is it afternoon already?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.454
Your dog's wearing a diaper.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.456
Miss Suzannah.
She's a breeding dog.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.374
It's her time of the month.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.335
That's fuckin' weird.
Hey, you know where

18:06.376 --> 18:07.920
I can find the laundry
in this shithole?

18:07.961 --> 18:09.254
You know, I couldn't help
but notice

18:09.296 --> 18:12.549
that you just hanged
some sort of...curtain?

18:12.591 --> 18:13.717
Sorry. Who are you again?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.135
Melanie Runkin,
on-site manager.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.179
We met after your husband
signed the lease.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.139
From the South Side, right?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.682
-What about it?
-They probably do things

18:20.724 --> 18:22.976
differently down there, but
here at the Arlington Grove,

18:23.018 --> 18:25.479
we have a...
a whites-only policy.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.314
That's some racist-ass shit.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.566
-I'm talking about curtains.
-Oh.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.860
You can read the guidelines
in the CCNRs.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.196
-Come on, Miss Suzannah.
-The CCN what?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.156
[Melanie] Bye!

18:36.198 --> 18:38.951
Poor fucking dog.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.788
[Veronica] It's about
1,600 square feet,

18:42.830 --> 18:45.040
not counting
the back storage area.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.542
Two blocks away from the El.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.085
Kev, we're not keeping
those things.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.837
Yes, we are!

18:49.878 --> 18:52.464
[Veronica] Okay? Yes.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.757
That would be great.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.551
All right, I'll see you there.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.262
That was our commercial
real-estate agent.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.222
He's coming by
to check out the Alibi.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.266
He said it should sell
pretty easily.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.309
That's our cue to go.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.811
What? Why?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.355
If you're selling, we need to
start dating other bars.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.481
We gotta find our new home.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.901
Wait, so th-that's it?
You're just leavin' us?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.528
[Tommy] See ya.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.487
[door opens]

19:15.529 --> 19:17.614
V, we need to slow down
a little bit here.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.907
We are moving forward.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.160
All of this
is in our rearview mirror!

19:21.201 --> 19:22.202
Not mine!

19:22.244 --> 19:23.745
-[Lip] Yo. What up?
-[Veronica] Hey.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.914
-Hey, I'm glad to see you.
-Hey, yeah, I, uh, came by

19:25.956 --> 19:27.624
to grab the sink
from Stan's old apartment?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.376
You guys said I could
have it for the remodel?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.670
Yeah, yeah, come on.
I'm really glad you're here.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.006
I...I need a guy chat
right now, I'm--

19:34.047 --> 19:35.299
I-I need some support.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.426
Well, I'm kind of pressed
for time--can it wait?

19:37.467 --> 19:38.510
Not really.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.720
-[Veronica] Hey, Lip.
-Yeah.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.555
You can ransack our place.
Take whatever you need.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.974
-What do you mean?
-We sold our house.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
Wait, wait, wait--you what?

19:45.893 --> 19:48.061
[Kev] Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.522
We did.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.441
I'm just hearin'
about this now?

19:52.482 --> 19:54.359
[Kev] Well, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.945
You know? I'm feeling
a little unmoored here.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.239
You guys didn't even do
any renovations.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.449
No, buyers are just gonna
knock it down.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.909
Fuck me.
Who is this person?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.619
Developer.
Left a note in our door.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.995
I'm sure she left one
in yours, too.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.663
They wanna buy three houses
on the block.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.249
You serious? I been bustin' my
ass to fix the place to sell,

20:09.291 --> 20:10.876
and you guys get an offer
just like that?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.753
175 large.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.379
Shit.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.342
-You still got that note?
-I should. Let me check.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.676
Hey, Lip?

20:19.718 --> 20:20.761
-Lip.
-Yeah.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.512
Guy chat? Kitchen sink?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.722
Yeah, shit, I'm sorry, Kev.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.349
This is kind of a lot
for me to process right now.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.602
-Yeah, how do ya think I feel?
-Ah, here it is.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.686
Yeah.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.313
All right, I'ma call her
right now.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.648
And, Kev, I'll call you
later, all right?

20:32.689 --> 20:35.025
Yeah, sure thing.
Great talk. Thanks.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.401
Bye.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.904
Fuck.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.450
You guys aren't gonna be
my neighbors anymore.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.336
Despite all of this
potentially turning

20:54.378 --> 20:56.463
into a major lawsuit
for the department,

20:56.505 --> 20:58.674
I was very inspired
by your speech.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.217
Thank you, sir--
uh, ma'am.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.761
Ha. Reminded me of why
I became a police officer

21:02.803 --> 21:05.264
-in the first place.
-Really?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.099
Your words--
mm, mm, mm--

21:07.140 --> 21:08.850
brought a tear to my eye.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.102
-Is that so?
-Yes.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.146
It was beautiful.
But you made the wrong choice.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.481
Went against the department.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.857
So you're gonna fire me?

21:15.899 --> 21:18.026
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't fire you.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.362
Union won't let me.
But I can demote you.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.947
-Demote me?
- Hmph.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.909
Welcome to your new job,
Meter Maid Gallagher.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.828
Ha ha.

Mmm.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.176
Oh. Ahh.

-[door closes]
-[Debbie] Hey, Tami.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.719
[Tami] Hey.
We were just talking

22:25.761 --> 22:28.263
about all the hair you grow
during a pregnancy.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.681
[Debbie] Oh, God,
don't remind me.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.058
whenever I would shave
my thighs,

22:31.099 --> 22:32.434
it would grow back
the next day.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.061
It was like I was
living in hair shorts.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.645
[woman] Kids are a pain
in the ass.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.231
Uh, what are you doin' here?
Need a haircut?

22:38.273 --> 22:40.067
I need a life.
I'm trying to figure out

22:40.108 --> 22:42.611
how to find a relationship
that lasts.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.696
-[woman] You single?
-Yeah.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.114
[woman] Ooh, lucky!

22:46.156 --> 22:47.699
No. I hate it.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.533
Why?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.494
I mean,
I don't want to be alone.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.412
Well, I wish I were
sometimes.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.872
[woman] Ooh, me too!

22:53.914 --> 22:55.248
How can you guys say that?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.084
-[woman] Easier.
-Yeah, you get to make

22:57.125 --> 22:58.335
all the decisions yourself.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.796
[woman] Don't have to deal
with anybody else's baggage.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.297
-Exactly.
-[Debbie] No.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.424
I want someone
to share a life with.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.259
I mean, I wanna
take care of someone.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.719
[Tami] I don't know, Debs.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.720
I-it's possible

23:08.762 --> 23:11.306
you might be alone
the rest of your life.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.266
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

23:13.308 --> 23:16.311
I just mean that your parents
were really shitty role models.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.397
[scoffs] Yeah, they were
pretty shitty.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.775
[Tami] Yeah. They didn't
teach you how to connect,

23:21.817 --> 23:23.068
be vulnerable,

23:23.110 --> 23:26.279
resolve conflict,
communicate, compromise.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.906
[woman]
Damn, that's some real talk!

23:27.948 --> 23:30.492
I didn't even know those were
things I was supposed to do.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.660
Yeah, and it's not your fault

23:31.701 --> 23:33.537
that you don't know
those things.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.497
Yeah. It's Frank's fault.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.208
Yeah. It is.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.545
I mean, he ruined love for me.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.800

Thank you, doll.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.604

See you soon, Frank.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.064
Bye.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.108
[Liam] Sounds like everything
worked out okay

24:03.150 --> 24:04.484
in the romance department.

24:04.526 --> 24:07.070
I don't know about romance,

24:07.112 --> 24:09.531
but I'm still
really good at fucking.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.617
[Liam chuckles]
Frank Gallagher's still got it.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.206
[woman] Forgot your towel?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.083
Yeah, I didn't even
think of it.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.252
Here. We have extras.
They're clean.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.837
-Thank you.
-We're in apartment 203.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.965
Just bring it back some time.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.299
-[man] Washed.
-Alan. Of course

25:51.341 --> 25:53.343
he's gonna wash it
before he returns it.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.930
I don't know--he didn't shower
before he jumped in the pool.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.890
-Oh--
-Don't listen to him.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.058
He's a stickler for rules.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.769
-It's written right there.
-Sorry about that.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.980
Didn't see it,
but won't happen again.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.565
I promise, Alan.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.276
I'll let it go this time.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.611
-Thanks.
-You just move in?

26:11.653 --> 26:13.363
I did. With my husband.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.198
Here.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.075
Sit, sit.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.745
I'm Jill.
And Alan, of course.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.414
-Ian.
-[Alan] So, Ian,

26:22.455 --> 26:24.833
what do you do,
besides contaminate our pool?

26:24.874 --> 26:26.293
[Jill] Stop, Alan!

26:26.334 --> 26:28.420
It has chlorine in it.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.505
He's only joking with you.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.132
That's okay, I don't mind.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.466
I, uh, have actually

26:33.508 --> 26:35.093
never lived in a place
like this before,

26:35.135 --> 26:36.219
so this is all new to me.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.887
I grew up on the South Side
my whole life.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.640
Well, you're gonna love it
on the West Side.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.225
There's so much to do
over here.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.185
The restaurants, cafes...

26:44.227 --> 26:46.479
yoga studios.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.829
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, what are you doin' here?

27:02.871 --> 27:05.415
Came by to see how your first
day in the new job was.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.541
I think I'm gonna like it--

27:06.583 --> 27:07.959
drill on the street
and whatnot.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.502
Finally feel like
I have a purpose.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.503
Good for you.

27:10.545 --> 27:11.880
What are you doin'
in that thing?

27:11.921 --> 27:14.174
Sometimes I like to take it
for a little joy ride.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.635
Usually people take out
a Landi or a 'Stang

27:16.676 --> 27:17.927
for a joy ride.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.305
Arthur Tipping takes out
the meter maid vehicle.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.307
Hey, I know you don't think
I'm very adventurous.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.142
-True statement.
-But I can prove you wrong.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.978
How? You gonna steal a doughnut
from 7-Eleven?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.688
Break up a fight
on a playground?

27:28.730 --> 27:29.898
Talk too loud in church?

27:29.939 --> 27:31.399
I happen to have
a very wild side.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.275
[Carl] Ha ha!

27:32.317 --> 27:33.860
You know
the "Renegade" Challenge?

27:33.902 --> 27:35.362
Yeah? What of it?

27:35.403 --> 27:36.738
You and me, let's go.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.948
We're officers of the law.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.325
And I'm on duty.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.661
What's that I hear?
You're a scared little pussy?

27:42.702 --> 27:44.871
Bitch, you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.331
And you're not on TikTok.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.833
Oh, ho ho.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.669
- "Renegade" plays
-Oh, my God.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.961
That's my song!

27:52.003 --> 27:55.340
Renegade, renegade,
renegade, renegade

27:55.382 --> 27:59.469
Go go go go

27:59.511 --> 28:01.262
[Carl] Fuck you.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.810
Watch and learn, nerd.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.728
Like I hit the lottery,
the lottery

28:08.770 --> 28:11.439
Hos a trip, watch 'em
how they fall on me

28:11.481 --> 28:14.693

28:19.614 --> 28:21.199
Yeah, I keep a style on me

28:21.241 --> 28:22.659
Style on me, pretty freaks

28:22.701 --> 28:23.993
Make them bitches
pile on me

28:24.035 --> 28:25.829

28:25.870 --> 28:28.164
I got 30 thou on me
right now

28:28.206 --> 28:29.999
Go go go go go

28:30.041 --> 28:31.584
Go, let's go

28:31.626 --> 28:33.545
-Hey.
-[woman] Hey.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.713
-You Lip?
-Yeah, yeah.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.173
-Hey, Flavia.
-Hi.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.551
-Thanks for reaching out.
-Yeah, yeah, you got it.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.053
So, uh, look, I got the note
you left on our door,

28:42.095 --> 28:44.097
and, uh, the Balls said
you bought their house?

28:44.139 --> 28:46.141
Oh, my boss did.
I'm just helpin' her out.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.435
She's lookin' for three
houses in a row on this block,

28:48.476 --> 28:50.520
and we just acquired that one.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.771
Oh, the old Milkovich house.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.106
So--so my house
would be the third.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.649
If you're willin' to sell.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.277
Could offer you 200K
for the land.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.529
New development goin' up.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.239
Oh, you're pushin' people
out, huh?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.908
You know folks have lived
here for generations.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.077
-Be unrecognizable soon.
-I got another appointment

29:06.119 --> 29:08.329
in, uh, ten minutes, so...

29:08.371 --> 29:09.622
Do we have a deal?

29:09.664 --> 29:11.958
I could, uh, send over
the paperwork for you to sign.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.210
Money would be wired
into your account

29:14.252 --> 29:16.087
in under two weeks.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.592
Look, since I'm
the last man standing

29:20.633 --> 29:23.887
and, uh, you need my house
to finish the project,

29:23.928 --> 29:25.889
seems only fair
I get more than $200.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.099
Well, how much you thinkin'?

29:28.141 --> 29:31.186
I couldn't see myself selling
for less than $300.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.314
We could, uh, probably
make $250 work.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.357
Two seventy-five?

29:36.399 --> 29:39.110
You drive a hard bargain,
Mr. Gallagher.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.696
Let me talk to my boss.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.448
Thank you.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.461

29:56.503 --> 29:57.879
[softly] What the fu--

29:57.921 --> 29:59.464
I can go faster than you
with my eyes closed

29:59.506 --> 30:01.674
-and my dick in my hand.
-Yeah, very, very funny.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.635
All right, nothin' to see.
Move along.

30:03.676 --> 30:07.055
punchy music

30:08.890 --> 30:10.225
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.477
Please, please, please,
I'm right here, I'm right here.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.937
Sorry. Meter's expired.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.939
[sighs] I know. I remembered
when I was already in line.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.274
I didn't wanna leave
and lose my spot, man.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.693
Come on, you know how long
it takes in the post office.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.071
Look, I'm just doin'
my job, buddy.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.489
[softly] Oh, fuck.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.032
How much is the ticket?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.575
I got furloughed last week,
and--

30:27.617 --> 30:29.661
[woman] Hey, shit for brains,
better not ticket my car.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.788
Seriously, have you nothing
better to do

30:31.830 --> 30:33.289
than be a bottom-feeding
scumbag

30:33.331 --> 30:35.458
who can't make a living
any other way?

30:39.295 --> 30:41.297
You know what?
You can go, son.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.258
-What?
-[Carl] Yeah.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.134
Seriously, no ticket for you.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.344
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.429
I'm the type a cop
who gives the poor man a break

30:48.471 --> 30:50.723
every single time,
no questions asked.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.892
Okay, great.
Thank you.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.728
jazzy music

30:55.770 --> 30:57.063
However, as for you,

30:57.105 --> 30:59.357
I'm going to make
people like you pay

30:59.399 --> 31:00.775
every single time.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.152
You rich fucks are goin' down.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.740
Hey, girls, I need
to tell you somethin'.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.493
Sometimes
change needs to happen,

31:10.535 --> 31:12.996
and when it does,
at first, it's really hard.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.581
But in the long run,

31:14.622 --> 31:16.958
it's always for the best.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.460
Well, not always. I mean,
I had to change foster families

31:19.502 --> 31:21.254
from the Butterfields
to the Carrias,

31:21.296 --> 31:22.297
and that wasn't so great.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.133
The Carrias liked to
beat me with belts

31:25.174 --> 31:27.427
and slippers and hairbrushes.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.679
Yeah, come to think of it...

31:29.721 --> 31:31.598
change is really, really bad.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.349
Kev, what are you doin'?
Just tell them.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.934
Girls, we are leaving Chicago

31:34.976 --> 31:36.436
and moving to Louisville.
Cool? Cool.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.021
That's exactly what
I was doing,

31:38.062 --> 31:40.273
but I was trying to
do it in a delicate way.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.441
-Well, it wasn't workin'.
-[door opens]

31:41.482 --> 31:43.776
[Frank] Afternoon,
my fellow Americans.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.695
-[Kev] Hey, Frank!
-[Frank] The finest beer

31:45.737 --> 31:47.780
-for me and my son.
-[Liam] I'll take a Coke.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.407
Hey, Frank.
Been waitin' for you.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.034
-Ohh!
-[Liam] Hey!

31:51.075 --> 31:52.952
Hey, are you okay?
Debbie, the hell you doing?

31:52.994 --> 31:55.455
Back up, Liam!
You ruined love for me!

31:55.496 --> 31:57.206
I'll be alone
the rest of my life!

31:57.248 --> 31:58.333
That's true!

31:58.374 --> 32:00.293
The only way
you'll ever have love

32:00.335 --> 32:03.755
is to find someone who's even
a bigger loser you are.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.924
Then they won't leave you!

32:06.966 --> 32:08.927
-[Frank] Ah! Jesus!
-[Liam] Get off!

32:08.968 --> 32:10.845
[panting] Come on, Franny.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.972
[Liam] Are you okay
She break anything?

32:13.014 --> 32:14.724
[Kev]
You all right there, Frank?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.894
[Frank, grunting]
Never better.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.856
[Liam] Guess we can scratch
bar fight off the list.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.900
[Frank] Mm--God!

32:23.942 --> 32:27.153
Kev, there's something
wrong with the beer. [groans]

32:27.195 --> 32:29.447
-I tapped it this morning.
-It tastes like poison.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.283
-[Kev] It's fine.
-[Liam] Maybe try bottled beer.

32:32.325 --> 32:36.120
[Kev] Yeah, can you get him
a Heisler, V?

32:42.877 --> 32:44.921
[Veronica]
What the hell, Frank?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.632
My body's rejecting alcohol.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.384
[Kev] Jesus, Frank.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.511
[Liam sighs]

32:51.552 --> 32:53.596
Here, try these.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.598
-I'm scared.
-It's just like you told me.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.392
Feel the fear and do it anyway.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.851
I said that?

32:58.893 --> 33:00.853
I'm sure you intended to
at some point.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.158
[Frank]
It's no use, son.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.327
Who am I without alcohol?

33:16.369 --> 33:18.162
[Liam]
You're Frank Gallagher!

33:18.204 --> 33:20.206
It's my one true love.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.209
But now she's rejecting me.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.349
Oh, shit.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.767
You again.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.436
Well, I am the on-site manager.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.146
-How can I help you?
-Haven't gotten

33:43.187 --> 33:45.523
-our furniture yet.
-Okay.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.442
You know when it's comin'?

33:47.483 --> 33:49.569
I'm not exactly sure
why I would know that.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.612
Where did you order it from?

33:51.654 --> 33:53.990
Order it? No.
It's the shit you guys had.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.576
I want to help you,
but I'm very confused.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.536
The furniture,
like in the apartment

33:58.578 --> 34:01.205
on the tour you showed us--
where's ours?

34:01.247 --> 34:03.624
Oh!
[laughs]

34:03.666 --> 34:05.043
I get it now.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.420
The apartments,
they don't come with furniture.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.298
-Wait, what?
-They're unfurnished.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.009
Why the hell'd you show us
one that had furniture, then?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.927
Uh, that was a model.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.137
[Mickey] Huh?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.556
An example of how an apartment
can look.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.475
Okay, hold on.
So we don't get any furniture.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.810
No, I'm sorry.
But that is very cute.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.562
I've never had anyone
ask me that before.

34:24.604 --> 34:27.440
It's not fucking cute, lady,
you should've told us that shit

34:27.482 --> 34:29.233
before we signed
the stupid-ass lease.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.403
You and your fuckin'
weird-ass dog.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.407
Don't tell me I'm fuckin' cute

34:36.449 --> 34:38.576
for your fuckin' bullshit,
lady.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.622
Fuck it!
You owe me some chairs.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.459
[Alan] Excuse me.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.128
-You can't take those.
-Like hell I can't, bitch!

34:49.170 --> 34:50.421
[Alan] But they're
for everyone.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.507
Well, guess they shouldn't
charge so much rent

34:52.548 --> 34:54.550
for an apartment don't
have no fuckin' furniture!

34:54.592 --> 34:57.095
[Ian] You gotta put
the chair back, Mickey.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.055
[Mickey] What the hell are you
doin' in the pool?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.723
This is Jill and Alan.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.101
I don't give a shit
if it's Siegfried & Roy.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.353
I'm out here gettin' harassed
left and right

35:05.394 --> 35:06.729
from everybody in this dump,

35:06.771 --> 35:09.690
and you're in the pool playin'
fuckin' footsie with these two!

35:09.732 --> 35:10.525
[Ian] It's fine.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.443
Hey, you can't take the chairs.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.237
We're gonna get fined
or evicted.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.697
[Mickey] You know,
I don't give a shit!

35:16.739 --> 35:19.700
You know what? Fuck you
and the horse you rode in on,

35:19.742 --> 35:22.370
just like everybody else
in the fuckin' West Side!

35:22.411 --> 35:25.790
This place blows!
I'm out of here!

35:33.005 --> 35:35.133
[Jill]
That your husband?

35:35.174 --> 35:36.551
Yep.

35:36.592 --> 35:38.261
[Alan] Passionate.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.263
Yep.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.143
All right, just
a couple more minutes, love.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.811
-[door closes]
-[Lip] Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.146
-Guess what.
-Hey, babe.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.313
Brought back
the cleaning supplies.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.482
Don't need it anymore.
We're sellin' the house.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.068
I know, that's...that's why
you've been spending

35:54.110 --> 35:56.529
-so much time on it.
-No, I mean we're selling

35:56.571 --> 35:57.905
the house, like, right now,
right?

35:57.947 --> 36:00.116
I just talked to a realtor
who works for a developer

36:00.158 --> 36:02.577
who wants to buy up
three houses on the block.

36:02.618 --> 36:05.204
She already got two, including
Kev's--she gave him $175.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.331
All cash.
Offered me $200.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.041
I said I wouldn't do it
for less than $275.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.210
-Isn't that amazing?
-Okay, whoa, slow down.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.962
-What?
-What are you talking about?

36:13.004 --> 36:15.173
Well, I'm talkin' about us
finally having enough money

36:15.214 --> 36:16.382
to buy our own place.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.385
Yeah, but you turned down
$200,000?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so I could make $275.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.555
Right?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.390
I mean, it was a tactic.
I was workin' her over.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.392
You should've seen me.
You would've been impressed.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.768
-I was good.
-Okay, but I'm confused.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.188
So she--she gave you
the $275?

36:30.229 --> 36:31.689
No, no, no, not yet,
but she will,

36:31.731 --> 36:33.357
and the best part is,
I don't have to spend

36:33.399 --> 36:35.610
any more money
workin' on the house, right?

36:35.651 --> 36:38.571
I mean, developer's
just gonna tear it down.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.406
Look, you know what?

36:40.448 --> 36:41.908
I'm gonna tear out
some a the new shit

36:41.949 --> 36:43.075
I put in the house.

36:43.117 --> 36:45.203
I'm gonna sell it, all right?

36:46.871 --> 36:50.499
heavy rock music

36:53.461 --> 36:54.879
[man] Oh, shit, it's Heidi.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.797
That's right, cockroaches!

36:56.839 --> 36:59.217
Heidi's back.

36:59.258 --> 37:04.222
[guttural singing]

37:09.143 --> 37:12.563
[humming]

37:14.106 --> 37:17.401
Thank you for your hospitality.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.364
That don't make up for you
being a shitty mama, though.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.240
[groans]

37:22.281 --> 37:23.616
You want me to put

37:23.658 --> 37:25.868
your TV program on for you?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.495
There ya go.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.330
[siren wailing]

37:29.372 --> 37:31.999
Those fucking rat-ass
neighbors of yours!

37:32.041 --> 37:34.919
Don't be sad
if I shoot some of them.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.424
You are excused
for being a shitty car.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.885
Shitty car.
Shitty car.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.221
You, however, are not.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.430
Pow!

37:59.819 --> 38:01.946
[beeping]

38:05.074 --> 38:07.118
[woman] Oh, no, please,
hey, come on.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.328
I'm right here.
Don't give me a ticket, hey.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.456
Sorry, miss.
The meter's expired.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.458
Wha--Carl!

38:14.500 --> 38:17.295
Tish. You're pregnant.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.671
You're a meter maid.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.755
You have a Lexus?

38:19.797 --> 38:21.299
[chuckles]
It's my boss's.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.009
She lets me borrow it
sometimes.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.635
The driver's seat in my car

38:24.677 --> 38:26.262
doesn't really go back
far enough.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.848
The steering wheel
digs into my belly.

38:28.889 --> 38:31.058
Oh. Yeah.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.810
Are you still gonna
give me a ticket?

38:32.852 --> 38:35.354
Of course not.
If I didn't know you, I would.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.773
That's my new mission in life--
fuck over the rich.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.276
-That's a good mission.
-Thanks.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.403
How long you been
a meter maid?

38:42.445 --> 38:45.156
I really hate that name.
I prefer something else.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.991
-[Trish] Like what?
-I don't know.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.034
Meter Master maybe.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.077
Oh! How about, um...
Ticket Titan?

38:50.119 --> 38:52.538
Ah, that's good, too.
Parking Punisher?

38:52.580 --> 38:54.623
Oh, sexy.
Sultan of the Summons.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.043
I am the Lord of the Late Fees.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.377
-[giggles]

38:59.587 --> 39:01.339
I gotta get back to work.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.552
Hey, Tish.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.347
-Is that my baby?
-[car door opens]

39:10.514 --> 39:13.142
Thanks for not giving me
a ticket.

39:18.230 --> 39:22.068
[car door closes,
engine turns over]

39:26.238 --> 39:29.575
-[sirens wailing]
-Wee whoo, wee whoo, wee whoo.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.995
Yeah. I hear
the sirens, too, Franny.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.956
Maybe Grandpa was right.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.833
-Why?
-[huffs]

39:37.875 --> 39:41.629
Mommy's a loser.
What can I say?

39:41.670 --> 39:43.214
Mama's a loser.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.174
[scoffs]
It's true.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.717
If I find a bigger loser
than me,

39:46.759 --> 39:48.761
maybe then
they won't leave me.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.679
Wouldn't that be nice,
Franny?

39:50.721 --> 39:53.391
-Having another mommy?
-I want two mommies!

39:53.432 --> 39:54.725
-[sirens wailing]
-Me too.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.395
If only I can find a loser
bigger than me,

39:57.436 --> 39:59.438
-then I won't be alone--
-Don't say a fucking word.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.856
Everything's gonna be fine.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.483
Just go along
with what I'm about to do,

40:02.525 --> 40:04.443
otherwise I'll shoot your kid.
in the head.

40:04.485 --> 40:08.572
[sirens wailing]

40:13.536 --> 40:16.747
[sirens fading]

40:20.501 --> 40:23.087
That was nice.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.131
Yeah. Kind of was.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.758
I'm Heidi.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.927
Debbie.

40:32.930 --> 40:33.889
[door opens]

40:33.931 --> 40:36.100
[Tommy] Honey, we're home.
Did you miss us?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.936
Well, if it isn't
Judas and Brutus.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.771
[Tommy] Sorry, V.
We should never have left you

40:40.813 --> 40:42.523
for another bar--
beer, please.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.608
-[Kermit] Me too.
-[Tommy] Where's Kev?

40:44.650 --> 40:46.986
We wanna apologize to him, too.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.487
Brought the girls
to a playdate,

40:48.529 --> 40:51.198
Trying to see all their friends
before we leave.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.826
I'm not gonna lie, V.
It was brutal out there.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.870
Other bars are chargin'
$12 a drink.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.038
And they have
all kinds of rules.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.707
Couldn't take off my shoes.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.709
-[Kermit] No napping.
-Wouldn't let us run a tab.

41:01.750 --> 41:02.835
Two-drink minimum.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.378
Can't sit down
unless you order food.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.714
One place wouldn't even let us
in without a valid I.D.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.591
[Tommy] And that one bar
that wanted a credit card

41:08.632 --> 41:10.551
before we even ordered
anything?

41:10.593 --> 41:12.428
-Total scam.
-Well, I hope you two

41:12.470 --> 41:13.387
learned your lesson.

41:13.429 --> 41:17.016
-Please forgive us.
-[door opens]

41:17.057 --> 41:19.101
Well...

41:19.143 --> 41:21.020
look who's back.

41:21.061 --> 41:24.523
Benedict  and  Arnold.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.150
[Tommy] Kev.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.359
-[Kermit] Sorry.
-[Kev] Hmph.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.528
-How are the girls, babe?
-Great. They're gonna have

41:29.570 --> 41:31.071
dinner over there,
watch the  Trolls  movie,

41:31.113 --> 41:32.948
and Calise's mom's
gonna drop 'em off later.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.783
Where'd you get
these books from?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.118
-The library.
-What?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.828
Yeah, near Calise's house.
Can you believe it?

41:37.870 --> 41:40.206
We're about to move, and I find
out we live next to a library.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.248
Who knew?

41:41.290 --> 41:43.334
-Well, what'd ya get it?
-Well, I went in there

41:43.375 --> 41:44.960
to ask that woman
who works there...

41:45.002 --> 41:47.087
-The librarian?
-Long gray hair, glasses,

41:47.129 --> 41:48.631
oversized corduroy jumper?

41:48.672 --> 41:50.174
-Yeah, that's her.
-[Tommy] That's her.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.717
-That's the one.
-Yeah.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.719
Okay, well, I asked her
if she had books on Kentucky,

41:53.761 --> 41:55.137
and check it out--
I'm gonna learn everything

41:55.179 --> 41:57.515
there is to know about
that dumb old state.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.683
Oh, babe, you're the best!

41:59.725 --> 42:01.393
I know.
[chuckles]

42:01.435 --> 42:02.937
Hey, do you know the guy
on the penny

42:02.978 --> 42:04.688
-was born in Kentucky?
-Abe Lincoln.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.607
You read these books, too?

42:06.649 --> 42:08.526
[Veronica giggles]

42:10.152 --> 42:11.195
[whispers] Shit.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.489
Hey, Howie, here, let me, uh,
let me give a hand

42:13.531 --> 42:14.573
with that, man.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.367
Here ya go, man.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.952
Give ya $200 for it.

42:17.993 --> 42:19.537
Yeah, good, good.

42:19.578 --> 42:22.164
-Wife's gonna love it.
-Cool, thanks, man.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.874
Yo, knuckleheads,
get over here.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.042
-[man] Yo, Lip.
-Yeah, yeah.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.585
-You selling that microwave?
-Yeah, everything.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.087
-Everything's gotta go.
-How much?

42:28.128 --> 42:31.340
Uh, I paid $150 for it,
so just give me 100 for it.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.842
-Hundred?
-Thanks, man.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.220
-[Flavia] Hey, Lip.
-[Lip] Thank--thank you.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.763
Hey. Hey, there ya are.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.223
I was, uh, I was waitin'
on your call,

42:39.265 --> 42:41.559
-but in person's even better.
-Yeah, the, uh,

42:41.600 --> 42:42.977
the guy carrying out
your stove

42:43.018 --> 42:44.478
said I could find you
back here.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.188
Yeah, yeah, we're ju--we're
getting rid of everything,

42:46.230 --> 42:47.523
you know,
especially if your boss

42:47.565 --> 42:50.818
-is gonna tear the place down.
-Oh, yeah, um, about that.

42:50.859 --> 42:51.819
Yeah. What's up?

42:51.860 --> 42:53.946
Uh, she doesn't wanna
buy your house now.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.406
What?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.701
Y-you said she needs
three houses, right?

42:58.742 --> 43:00.411
Yeah, she got them.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.414
Uh...I don't understand.

43:03.455 --> 43:06.250
The man who lives
on the other side of the Balls,

43:06.292 --> 43:08.127
he closed his deal.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.837
Old man Jefferson
sold his house?

43:09.878 --> 43:11.380
For $200,000.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.632
I-I didn't even know
you made him an offer.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.301
It's business.
My boss is very savvy.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.469
I encouraged you
to take her offer earlier.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.138
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh...

43:19.179 --> 43:20.472
All right, well, look, look,

43:20.514 --> 43:22.057
I'll just take
the original offer, uh,

43:22.099 --> 43:23.475
that's $200, that's good.

43:23.517 --> 43:24.893
Sorry.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.771
uneasy music

43:27.813 --> 43:30.357
[man] How much for
the fridge, Lip?

43:32.735 --> 43:34.528
[Lip] Um...

43:39.325 --> 43:41.118
[Liam] You okay, Frank?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.786
Uh-huh.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.079
It's like the doctor said.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.707
You have good days
and bad days, right?

43:46.749 --> 43:48.751
That's right, son.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.176
[door closes]

43:59.219 --> 44:02.097
I had a fun time with you.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.891
Oh, yeah?

44:03.932 --> 44:06.352
What'd we do?

44:06.393 --> 44:08.437
I don't think
you ate enough today.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.773
Probably right.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.941
I'm gonna get food.

44:13.567 --> 44:16.528
Back at it again tomorrow?
We'll do more Frank things.

44:16.570 --> 44:19.281
You got it, son.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.951
-Hiya, Frank.
-Hey.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.286
What's goin' on in here?

44:24.328 --> 44:26.121
Oh, uh, the renovations.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.332
You know, I'm fixing up
the house to--

44:28.374 --> 44:30.668
I know what you're doing.

44:30.709 --> 44:31.669
Yeah?

44:31.710 --> 44:34.505
You're looking
for that brick of gold we hid

44:34.546 --> 44:37.174
when you were 12 years old,
aren't you?

44:38.884 --> 44:41.178
I, uh...

44:41.220 --> 44:42.554
I-I was.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.306
-I knew it!
-Busted.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.683
Ha ha ha!

44:45.724 --> 44:47.685
Son!

44:47.726 --> 44:49.603
Don't you remember?

44:49.645 --> 44:51.313
Uh, what's that?

44:51.355 --> 44:53.607
-We buried it.
-Right. Oh, yeah.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.484
-In the backyard.
-No, that's--that's right.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.820
So no one would find it,
except you and me.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.280
Now--now--now I remember.
Yeah.

45:00.322 --> 45:02.783
[chuckling]
Good thing I'm here.

45:02.825 --> 45:05.411
[laughing]

45:08.455 --> 45:12.167
I guess I'm gonna put
the kitchen back together now.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.630
We're gonna be rich tomorrow.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.132
[chuckles]

45:18.173 --> 45:20.426
[giggling]

45:20.467 --> 45:23.971
mellow guitar

45:28.976 --> 45:30.269
[softly] Shit.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.354
-[both laughing]
-[Heidi] You're adorable.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.440
I feel the same way about you.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.483
[Heidi] There's a lot
about me, though,

45:36.525 --> 45:38.318
that you probably
aren't gonna like.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.904
Oh, God, don't even
get me started.

45:40.946 --> 45:42.156
Me too.

45:42.197 --> 45:45.242
-Like what?
-Pfft, for starters,

45:45.284 --> 45:48.162
teen mom, uh...

45:48.203 --> 45:50.289
raped a guy once.

45:50.330 --> 45:52.374
Stole a baby.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.543
Almost drowned a girl.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.754
I beat the shit out of...

45:56.795 --> 45:58.881
so many people.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.340
Once I drugged my half-sister

46:00.382 --> 46:01.842
and locked her
in a shipping crate.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.761
Aw. Child's play.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.220
-Really?
-Hell, yeah.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.514
-None of that bothers me.
-Good.

46:07.556 --> 46:08.974
How about you?

46:09.016 --> 46:10.768
-Oh, okay, you ready for this?
-Go.

46:10.809 --> 46:13.562
Okay, let's start--
when I'm six, uh,

46:13.604 --> 46:15.731
I bit a chunk off my mom's
boyfriend's face

46:15.773 --> 46:18.442
while he was sleeping.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.322
[distant siren wailing]

46:35.375 --> 46:37.544
[Ian] Hey.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.213
What are you doin' over here?

46:39.254 --> 46:42.758
Watchin' a bunch a jackasses
try the cinnamon challenge.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.927
You comin' back
to the apartment?

46:44.968 --> 46:47.471
I like it better
on the South Side.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.057
You haven't really given
the West Side a shot.

46:50.098 --> 46:51.850
Look, I don't fit in
over there, man.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.018
Neither do I.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.646
But...you know,
I'd like to try.

46:55.687 --> 46:58.857
Guess that's the difference
between you and me.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.527
We paid first, last,
and security.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.529
And they were supposed to
give us some fuckin' furniture.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.280
-We could buy our own.
-We're not gonna

47:05.322 --> 47:08.492
agree on anything--we'll have
different tastes and shit.

47:09.618 --> 47:13.247
So you're gonna stay here,
and I'm gonna live over there.

47:13.288 --> 47:15.040
Looks like it.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.583
It's nicer there.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.085
Well, I guess
I don't like nice.

47:18.126 --> 47:20.712
-Don't you want a better life?
-No.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.382
-Why?
-'Cause it's too much--

47:24.466 --> 47:27.010
It's too much fuckin'
pressure, all right?

47:29.930 --> 47:32.182
Okay.
I understand.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.519
Shit makes me feel
uncomfortable.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.564
Fine.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.358
Ahh.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.943
Fine what?

47:42.985 --> 47:45.863
Fine, we'll stay here, then.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.993
Why?

47:51.034 --> 47:52.369
Well, 'cause you're my husband.

47:52.411 --> 47:55.038
If you're not happy there,
then we don't have to be there.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.415
Don't do that shit.

47:56.456 --> 47:57.791
Don't do what?

47:57.833 --> 47:59.293
-Guilt trippin' me.
-I'm not.

47:59.334 --> 48:00.836
Yeah, you are--
you're doing the whole

48:00.878 --> 48:03.297
reverse fuckin' psychiatric
whatever the fuck.

48:03.338 --> 48:06.341
I swear...I'm not.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.553
What cinnamon challenge
things are you watching?

48:09.595 --> 48:11.680
God damn it.
All right, we'll go back.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.140
What?

48:13.181 --> 48:15.142
I'm not changin'
for anybody, though.

48:15.183 --> 48:16.435
Nobody wants you to change.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.145
Those gentrifyin'
motherfuckers do.

48:18.186 --> 48:19.605
All right,
maybe you could change

48:19.646 --> 48:21.064
an eensy, teensy little bit

48:21.106 --> 48:22.566
and not steal anything
in the apartment complex.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.902
That's what I'm sayin'.
I feel fuckin' handcuffed!

48:24.943 --> 48:26.153
That's all I'm asking for.

48:26.194 --> 48:27.279
You can do anything else
you want.

48:27.321 --> 48:28.280
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.948
Can I piss in the pool?

48:29.990 --> 48:31.700
-Ugh. Really?
-Yep.

48:31.742 --> 48:35.245
All right, fine, but I want you
to come to a yoga class.

48:35.287 --> 48:36.955
-Yo--no fuckin' way!
-All right, Whole Foods

48:36.997 --> 48:38.582
so we can stare
at the organic fruit.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.792
Jesus, really? That's what
you wanna fuckin' do?

48:40.834 --> 48:43.003
I'm letting you piss
in the pool.

48:43.045 --> 48:46.381
[scoffs]
Fine.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.803
You are such a fuckin'
barbarian.

48:51.845 --> 48:54.264
Thank you.

48:57.559 --> 48:59.269
[Kev] Oh, shit.

48:59.311 --> 49:02.230
That's why they call it
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

49:02.272 --> 49:04.358
Learn something new
every day.

49:04.399 --> 49:07.235
-You ready, babe? I'm tired.
-Yeah, let's do it.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.112
Do you know that two women
from Louisville

49:09.154 --> 49:10.989
invented
the "Happy Birthday" song?

49:11.031 --> 49:13.241
[clicks tongue]
Oh, my goodness.

49:13.283 --> 49:15.410
-Look at this.
-What?

49:15.452 --> 49:17.412
-Photo...
-Oh.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.873
Of you, me, and Stan.

49:19.915 --> 49:22.334
[Kev] That's when we first
started workin' here.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.336
How long ago
you think this was?

49:24.378 --> 49:26.254
It's at least 15 years ago.

49:26.296 --> 49:27.631
Wow.

49:28.674 --> 49:31.551
I cannot believe we're
uprooting our entire life.

49:31.593 --> 49:35.347
Everything we worked
so hard for.

49:36.682 --> 49:37.766
Oh...

49:37.808 --> 49:40.477
I knew there was emotion
in there.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.146
[Veronica sniffling, muttering]

49:44.940 --> 49:48.694
[crying] We're leaving
everything behind.

49:48.735 --> 49:50.779
-[sobbing]
-Hey, V.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.280
It's gonna be okay.

49:52.322 --> 49:55.033
[sobbing]

49:55.075 --> 49:56.743
Wait a minute.
Are you faking?

49:56.785 --> 49:59.204
Totally.
Rearview mirror, Kev.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.164
Let's go.

50:01.206 --> 50:03.625
That was just mean.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.631
Sh--

50:09.673 --> 50:11.633
[quietly] Fuck!

50:11.675 --> 50:13.844
[loudly] Oh, fuck!

50:15.137 --> 50:18.640
low funky music

51:02.809 --> 51:04.352
Hey, Kev.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.149
V!

51:50.357 --> 51:53.401
mellow guitar

52:41.950 --> 52:44.828
A little messed up,
do you feel it?

52:44.870 --> 52:47.998
A little bit a this
and a little bit a that

52:48.039 --> 52:50.959
She wanna know
which way I'm leanin'

52:51.001 --> 52:54.504
Am I really made of this,
am I really made of that?

52:54.546 --> 52:57.841
And is it so bad
if you need me?

52:57.883 --> 53:00.927
Just a little bit, whoa,
don't get rid of me

53:00.969 --> 53:03.263
But love is so blind
when you feel it

53:03.305 --> 53:06.558
Can't defeat it,
hope you're feeling

53:06.600 --> 53:10.187
High hopes

53:13.440 --> 53:15.901
High hopes

53:15.942 --> 53:18.695
Ah, that's so much better.

53:19.905 --> 53:23.200
High hopes

53:26.244 --> 53:29.623
High hopes

53:32.918 --> 53:36.171
I'ma talk like
I don't really mean it

53:37.756 --> 53:39.925
Bless me, St. John's,
I'ma act

53:39.966 --> 53:42.344
Like I don't really
need it

53:42.385 --> 53:45.639
Bet you see these funds,
they gon' cheer me up

53:45.680 --> 53:48.350
Brand-new whip,
sound like Cheerio

53:48.391 --> 53:50.977
Wake me up,
Rey Mysterio

53:51.019 --> 53:52.771
Ah, yeah, hey,
wipe my eyes

53:52.812 --> 53:55.273
Cant' see clearly, though,
I been on the block

53:55.315 --> 53:57.901
Boy move soft
like some cereal, ah, hey

53:57.943 --> 54:02.030
High hopes with you man,
I wanna see you again

54:04.157 --> 54:08.078
High hopes with you man,
I wanna see you again

54:08.119 --> 54:11.998
Yeah, I don't think
you good at keepin' secrets

54:12.040 --> 54:15.335
All the bags on the floor
make you heated

54:15.377 --> 54:17.003
Blind my eyes,
boy too bright

54:17.045 --> 54:18.296
He got them sequins

54:18.338 --> 54:21.216
Man, I hope you comin' back
to cop that free shit

54:21.258 --> 54:23.343
Back to cop
that free shit

54:23.385 --> 54:26.179
That's elite shit,
high hopes

54:30.141 --> 54:33.436
High hopes
