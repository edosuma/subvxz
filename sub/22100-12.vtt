she's pregnant.

lie down and quit?

00:34.785 --> 00:37.286
I was wrong about everything.

00:37.371 --> 00:42.417
And all those
people who listened
and trusted me, they're dead.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.794
We will find a new home.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.215
This is a promise
I intend to keep.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.302
Get the Cylon Baseship
on the horn.

That's a lot of smoking

She'll live.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.962
Look at that, Saul.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.131
Do you know what
that is, really?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.761
That's the future of
the entire Cylon race.

It doesn't even have a name
yet and already loading up
on the expectations.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.894
All he has to do is be born.

No Cylon-Cylon pairing
has ever produced
a child, ever.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.569
Believe me, it's been tried.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.031
That means it's...

04:00.115 --> 04:03.993
That means it's possible
for our race to survive,
even without resurrection.

No, no, frak.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.132
I've gone through two jars
of that stuff already.
It doesn't do anything.

be refitted.

it's too high on one side,

I'm sorry, Felix.
I'm really sorry.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.642

get you in there as soon
as I can.

It's busy today, Chief.

about having a Cylon as

We believe the fifth Cylon
to be dead.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.391
But you're not sure?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.685

she died some time ago.

A permanent alliance
between this government
and the Cylons,

is out of the question.

It's labor-intensive,
a lot of grunt work,

09:04.794 --> 09:08.505
but we should be able
to upgrade all the jump drives

09:08.590 --> 09:11.050
in the entire Fleet
with Cylon technology.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.385

to sell the Quorum
on this one.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.637
Frak the Quorum.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.972

What are you going to do?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.641

at gunpoint?

09:18.725 --> 09:22.186
We need the Quorum to get
civilian cooperation.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.896
All right.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.149
What will it take to get the
Quorum to sign off?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.903
Well, the first issue's
gonna be whether we can
make these upgrades

09:30.987 --> 09:33.364
with Galactica
personnel only.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.116
It's one thing to accept
Cylon technology.

09:36.201 --> 09:40.246
It's quite another to have
actual Cylons aboard
their ships.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.998
I barely understand
this stuff. I'm...

09:44.334 --> 09:49.755
But... We are gonna need teams
of Sharons and Sixes,

09:49.839 --> 09:53.092
possibly Leobens,
just to do the installations.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.302

We gotta sell them on it.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.304
Point out the benefits.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.474
Athena tells me the
upgrade should triple
the Fleet's jump capacity.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.644
Absolutely.
And that's conservative.

Our technology
is way ahead of ours.

to keep it all straight.

What do you think?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.034
Well...

10:20.412 --> 10:23.831
Tripling jump capacity
triples our chances of
finding a habitable planet

and fuel.

10:48.523 --> 10:52.401
You want Cylon technology,
we want safety in case
Cavil's forces arrive.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.486
Now if we're citizens,

10:54.571 --> 10:58.490
your oath states
that you protect us,
just like everybody else.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.451
And the other Cylons,

11:00.535 --> 11:04.121
they really think that
that will guarantee
your safety?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.041
Yes, they do.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.503
I've convinced them that the
Admiral takes these sorts
of things very seriously,

11:11.588 --> 11:15.257
that he would rather lose
the Fleet than break the oath.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.178
Unlike certain other people.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.433
I understand the argument.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.936
It makes sense from
their perspective.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.766
I think we caught it in time
to manage with dialysis.

12:05.850 --> 12:10.562
However, there is a chance
that this could lead to
chronic renal failure.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.732
(CHATTERING)

13:43.406 --> 13:45.657
I'm not his father, am I?

13:45.742 --> 13:47.075
I'm sorry.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.830
She found out she was
pregnant just before
you got married.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.750
She wasn't sure that
you were the father.

13:54.834 --> 13:59.004
She wanted me to
terminate the pregnancy.
The procedure is illegal,

13:59.088 --> 14:00.172
but there are ways
around it.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.008
However, she decided
to keep it.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.302
Then later on
she asked me to
do a paternity test

14:05.386 --> 14:07.930
because she wanted to know.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.599
And it wasn't me.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.897
Who?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.857
He doesn't know, either.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.610
And I'll be damned
if he's gonna find
out that he's a father

14:21.694 --> 14:23.612
from a pissed-off
former deck chief

14:23.696 --> 14:26.823
with a Cylon chip
on his shoulder.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.951
No, I'll have to tell him.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.622
I'll tell him, and then
the two of you can
work it out on your own.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.468
Take care of him.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.224

You know, the President
stopped returning my calls.

a rough patch.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.816
We all are.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.235
She'll get through it.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.070
It just takes time.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.616
Okay.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.244
But we're gonna need to know
her stance on this
citizenship thing

15:12.328 --> 15:14.371
sooner rather than later.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.917
I'll talk to you
about it later.

that you should
address the Fleet.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.837
What have you done?

29:58.464 --> 30:01.674
What have you done
to deserve this punishment?

30:03.427 --> 30:06.220
What sins have you committed?

30:06.305 --> 30:10.308
What dark thoughts
have you harbored
that condemn you...

30:10.392 --> 30:11.893
Condemn you

30:12.769 --> 30:16.230
to wander through the
universe without hope,

30:17.566 --> 30:19.066
without light?

30:20.027 --> 30:21.402
So, you have to ask yourself,

30:21.487 --> 30:25.156
what kind of a father
abandons his own children

30:25.240 --> 30:27.241
to despair and loneliness?

30:27.326 --> 30:28.367
No one!
No one!

30:28.452 --> 30:31.162
Perhaps we are not the ones
in need of forgiveness.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.330
Perhaps we're not.

30:32.414 --> 30:33.748
Perhaps we have been wronged.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.291
Yes.
That's right.

30:35.375 --> 30:40.296
Perhaps it is God
who should come down here
and beg for our forgiveness!

30:40.380 --> 30:42.632
Am I right? Am I right?

30:51.266 --> 30:53.893
There is a disease
aboard the ship,

30:54.019 --> 30:56.646
and it is a disease
of denial!

30:58.357 --> 31:01.359

Well, don't tell me.

With all respect, Colonel,
I don't think we're there yet,
but we do have a problem.

31:55.956 --> 31:59.584
A problem? Ten of our ships
refuse a direct order
from the flagship.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.086
Another 12 won't even
respond to our hails.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.588
They're not doing
anything illegal.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.089
The Quorum gave every ship
the right to refuse

32:05.173 --> 32:07.675
any Cylon or Cylon
technology aboard.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.386

And you alone get to make
that determination?

32:17.686 --> 32:19.270
Sir?

32:19.521 --> 32:21.063
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.816
I get to make
that determination.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.443
You have a problem with that?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.195
Admiral?
I'm in receipt of
an emergency signal

32:28.280 --> 32:31.240
from our marine commander
aboard the Hitei Kan.

has mutinied.

32:43.712 --> 32:44.962
This is the XO.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.597
You're ordered to
board the Colonial One.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.558
Locate and arrest
the Vice President.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.060
Then bring him
back to Galactica.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.772
Arrest and return to
Galactica.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.398
What are my
orders if he resists?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.109
In that case,

35:13.528 --> 35:16.530
the use of deadly
force is authorized.

35:29.002 --> 35:32.004
HOTDOG: I don't know anything
about being a father.

someone's always here.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.256
Wait.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.218
How long do I sit here?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.928
Until I get back.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.098
That'll be after I sober up.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.864
Sworn statements,

36:39.948 --> 36:43.826
transcripts of
wireless conversation,
shipping records.

36:43.910 --> 36:49.081
All kinds of documents,
really, compiled over
the last year,

36:50.166 --> 36:51.917
with one theme:

36:52.836 --> 36:57.339
the buying and the selling
of the Vice President's
office.

36:59.801 --> 37:04.305
So, this is a
conversation about extortion.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.558
No. About law and order.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.643
But you can call
it what you want.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.440
You see,
I believe that you would
walk happily to the gallows

37:15.609 --> 37:18.777
or languish in a cell
for the rest of your life,

37:19.529 --> 37:22.865
if you can do it as
a martyr to your cause.

37:26.786 --> 37:30.915
But the idea of being
publicly humiliated

37:32.208 --> 37:35.920
as a corrupt politician
with your hand in the till,

37:36.004 --> 37:38.339
well, that would scare you.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.593
Somehow, I don't think
that the legend and the myth,

37:42.677 --> 37:48.140
Tom Zarek,
the political prisoner
and a man of conscience,

37:48.224 --> 37:51.477
can survive the airing
of that much dirty laundry.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.607
You really think the Fleet
is going to sit still

37:56.733 --> 37:59.693

politically motivated trial

38:00.528 --> 38:03.280

with the Cylons?

38:03.365 --> 38:06.992

tylium ship we're not
going anywhere.

here for a long time.

where the tylium ship is.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.632
Yes, I do.

38:21.716 --> 38:22.967
Why?

38:24.636 --> 38:26.720
Because I know that you do.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.432
