WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:05.756
Yo, Tim Tim.
Mmm.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.716
This weekend,
monster truck rally

00:07.758 --> 00:08.968
at Madison Square Garden.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.719
Redneck chicks
so drunk on moonshine,

00:10.761 --> 00:13.138
they'll think
I'm Leonardo Dicaprio,

00:13.764 --> 00:15.850
and you're Kumar.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.061
I'll have to pass.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.438
All right,
how about this?

00:21.480 --> 00:24.358
Bridal expo
at the Javits Center, huh?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.694
"Oh, ha-ha, I didn't get
the dress I wanted.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.821
"I want a party with
Leo Dicaprio and Kumar."

00:31.490 --> 00:33.701
Seems rock solid, sir,
but again, pass.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.204
I know what you want,

00:37.245 --> 00:38.580
but no one's gonna believe
you're DiCaprio.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.292
Get real.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.044
(CLAPS) Hey, Timmy,
Jen and I are in
for dinner

00:45.086 --> 00:46.213
with your parents
on Saturday...
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm...

00:46.254 --> 00:47.381
Oh, yeah.
It's gonna be sweet!

00:48.716 --> 00:50.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.679
Your parents are coming
all the way from India,

00:53.721 --> 00:56.557
and the only person
you invited to meet them
is the office idiot?

00:58.475 --> 00:59.977
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.478
Yeah.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.938
You didn't get invited,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.272
but the office idiot did.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.909
Sir, I didn't invite you
because, and please don't
take this the wrong way.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.868
I loathe you.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.371
Timmy, I know
you're foreign,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.707
but it's pronounced love.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.710
Look, I know
I'm not always
the perfect boss.

01:27.838 --> 01:31.717
Sir, you stole my fiancee,

01:31.759 --> 01:34.553
accused me
of sexual harassment
when I saved your life,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.430
and make me
apply ointments
to areas of your body

01:36.471 --> 01:37.556
we both know
you can reach yourself.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.227
Well, just 'cause
I can reach them

01:42.269 --> 01:43.645
doesn't mean
I wanna touch them.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.566
Anyway, this is
the first time

01:47.608 --> 01:49.317
your parents
have been here.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.486
Sir, I don't even understand
why you care so much.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.280
I mean, let's face it.
You're a narcissist,

01:53.321 --> 01:54.573
who has no interest
in the lives of others.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.245
Sir, you're
admiring yourself

02:00.287 --> 02:01.413
in the reflection
of my glasses,
aren't you?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.709
I could pass as DiCaprio.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.754

Okay.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.964
Funny. I guess
I deserve that

02:52.006 --> 02:53.841
for giving you
and your wife a baby.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.300
Brenda, just ignore him.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.511
I mean, come on,
look at you.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.054
You're glowing.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.890
It's sweat
and angry hormones.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.226
In that case,
I'm so sorry.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.146
Hey, how about this.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.023
Why don't you come on over
for a big Saturday night?

03:09.064 --> 03:10.398
You could watch me drink.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.401
As intriguing
as that isn't,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.236
I can't because
I'm catering
an alumni event

03:15.278 --> 03:16.571
at Columbia university.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.823
Oh, Columbia?
BRENDA: Yeah.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.950
Huh, I wonder
if we're gonna hear about

03:19.992 --> 03:21.493
how my wife
almost got in there.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.246
I was wait-listed.
I could've gone there.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.290
If 400 smarter kids
decided not to,

03:28.667 --> 03:30.085
but if you didn't go
to Syracuse,

03:31.252 --> 03:32.379
you wouldn't
have met me.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.007
Don't make it worse.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.551
What's your, uh...
What's your event for?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.219
Um, Malcolm Gladwell
wrote a book,

03:39.260 --> 03:40.428
and he's giving a talk
about it,

03:40.470 --> 03:41.805
but then I am catering
the reception.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.640
I love his stuff.

03:43.682 --> 03:44.808
Yeah? They gave me
extra tickets

03:44.850 --> 03:46.267
if you guys wanna go.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.353
Oh, so it's a fellow
who wrote a book
talking about his book?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.688
Sounds like
an awful lot of book.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.192
We're going. Come on.
He's a great author.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.276
It'll be full of
interesting people.
I wanna go.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.820
Okay. Great.
I'll drop the tickets
by later.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.864
Oh, you know
what this means.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.658
You finally get
into Columbia.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.583
(GLASSES CLINKING)
ALL: Cheers.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.085
Mmm.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.004
Mmm.
It is so nice to meet you,
Varsha and Rahm.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.296
Timmy is one
of my favorite people.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.381
Aw.
(LAUGHS)

04:16.840 --> 04:17.966
Really?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.470
Yes.
Wow.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.388
Well, you think
you know someone.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.185
So, Rahm,
what's good here?

04:28.227 --> 04:30.270
Well, I love
the  mutter paneer.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.730
Oh, the  mutter paneer.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.941
Mmm.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.484
Oh, no,
well, the  mutter paneer
is only rated at two.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.402
It's probably terrible.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.739
Yep, no, here's a picture.
Straight up vomit.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.367
Mr. Rhodes,
the numbers

04:44.409 --> 04:45.953
aren't actually
a quality rating.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.704
They tell you
how spicy the dish is.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.664
One is the mildest,
12 is the spiciest.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.876
Ah. I am all
about spicy foods.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.335
See, at Taco Bell,

04:54.377 --> 04:56.546
I always go for
the El Scorcho
burrito, Varsh.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.592
There is no such thing
as an El Scorcho burrito.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.427
I created it in the fires
of my imagination.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.722
So I'm thinking
I'm gonna go eight.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.057
I might go eight
or maybe nine.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.558
Well, uh...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.894
I would strongly advise you
not to go above a four.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.105
Oh, Rahm.
Rahm-a-lama-ding-dong.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.984
The more you tell me
not to do something,

05:17.025 --> 05:17.901
the more I'm gonna do it.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.029
It's not something
to brag about.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.323
Well, now,
I'm just gonna brag more.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.335
You have got
to be kidding me.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.172
Oh, look who it is.
What are the chances?

05:38.213 --> 05:39.965
These must be
your parents.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.549
Please leave.
Just go away.

Yeah, I just said,
"Good evening.
My name is Russell."

05:51.893 --> 05:53.645
Timmy's so Americanized.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.980
I love your sherwani.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.481
Thank you.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
This is my favorite
of all the ones I have.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.484
I own very many.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.737
Hello, sir.
Are you with this party?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.447
Oh, no, he is not.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.492
No, he's right.
I'm dining alone tonight.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.831
I'll be over here,
and if you hear me
choking and gagging,

06:12.873 --> 06:13.957
and you wanna
give me the Heimlich,

06:13.999 --> 06:15.167
I'd love it,
but you don't have to,

06:16.668 --> 06:18.837
uh, 'cause again,
I'm by myself.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.049
We won't hear of that.
You'll join us.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.300
Please.
Oh, I couldn't!

06:26.385 --> 06:28.263
Sir.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.681
Do you really think
you can convince
my parents

06:29.723 --> 06:30.891
you're a decent person

06:30.932 --> 06:32.475
simply by learning
a phrase or two

06:32.517 --> 06:33.977
and dressing up
like the Indian Liberace?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.189
I assumed
you'd want your parents

06:37.231 --> 06:38.857
to meet your best friend
and mentor.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.108
Sir, I abhor you.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.071
Yeah, you bore everyone,
but I thought your parents
might be interesting.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.742
I told you specifically
I didn't want you here.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.244
Why? You think
I'm not good enough?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.203
I know you're not
good enough.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.164
Well, I think you're wrong,

06:54.206 --> 06:55.456
and I think your parents
are gonna love me.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.251
Fine.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.417
But when the real Russell
comes out,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.670
you'll offend my parents,

07:00.712 --> 07:02.089
offend everyone
at the restaurant,

07:02.130 --> 07:03.548
and the jig
will be up.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.759
Yeah. Hey, you know
what else is up?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.969
I'll give you a hint.
I'm going commando,

07:08.011 --> 07:09.512
and this silk
is super soft!

07:09.554 --> 07:10.847

07:10.889 --> 07:12.057
Whoo-hoo!

07:12.099 --> 07:13.100
Feels good.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.647
(SIGHS) That was one
of the best lectures
I've ever heard.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.483
Yeah. I'd put it
right up there
with your lecture

07:22.525 --> 07:24.152
on what goes
in the top rack
of the dishwasher.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.614
But, again,
I've only heard his once.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.366
Uh-huh.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.909
His was a little hard
to hear

07:30.951 --> 07:32.827
with you unwrapping
a jolly rancher
for 15 minutes.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.997
I'm no quitter.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.625
Look, I gotta go find
someone to talk to
who's not you.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.294
Go nuts.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.753
(LAUGHING)

07:43.171 --> 07:44.965
Oh, wow.
Great lecture, huh?

07:45.006 --> 07:47.467
Oh, he is just
so insightful.
Yeah.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.635

07:48.676 --> 07:51.054
Uh, I'm Evelyn.
Marjorie.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.139
Did you go
to Columbia, Audrey?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.266
It was my first choice.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.893
So are you coming back
next month

07:56.935 --> 07:58.437
for the Jonathan Franzen
lecture?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.022
Oh, I'll definitely
go to that.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.816
I love Jonathan Franzen.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.943
Hopefully, that idiot
with the candy wrapper
won't be here.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.154
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right?
Who brought him?

08:09.948 --> 08:13.201
Jack, this is
a disaster.
Oh, tell me about it.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.494
That guy who spoke
was lights-out boring.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.205
Guess what?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.333
I just got invited
to come to another
lecture next month.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.209
Okay, I'd be really
happy for you,

08:21.251 --> 08:23.837
except that my waitress
and my bartender
both just flaked on me...

08:23.878 --> 08:25.922
I am totally screwed.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.715
That's terrible.
No booze or food?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.676

No, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

08:29.717 --> 08:30.844
I hate to ask you guys this,

08:30.885 --> 08:32.762
but do you think
there's any way, Audrey,

08:32.804 --> 08:34.555
you could cover
for my waitress,

08:34.597 --> 08:35.974
and Jeff,
you could possibly
get behind the bar?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.058
Please, please,
please, please?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.894
Oh, Jeff's
not gonna wanna do that.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.356
Stand unsupervised
behind a bar
full of alcohol?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.942
That's number nine
on my bucket list.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.194
(SIGHS) thank you.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.987
Oh, all right, fine.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.697
Thank you.
I will get you an apron.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.407
Yeah, you're gonna
have to show her
how to put it on too.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.785

08:56.995 --> 08:58.872

to hold the light bulb,

09:02.167 --> 09:03.960
and the other two
to spin him on the ladder.

(LAUGHS) Yeah,
'cause they're idiots.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.761
Maybe you could explain
why they're idiots.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.431
Come on, man,
'cause they're Nepalese!

enjoying your dinner?

09:23.938 --> 09:25.440
Good.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.317
Yeah, level seven's
got a little kick.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.405
Still wish you
wouldn't have talked me
out of that level ten.

what's happening
right now.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.960
Oh, God.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.546
Ah, it's nothing
I can't handle,
though. Uh!

09:48.755 --> 09:50.382
Really, it looks
like you're struggling.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.051
(SIGHS) I am not.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.969
Adam, let it go.
No, I'm not
gonna let it go.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.514
Varsha called me out, honey.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.351
She stepped to me.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.979
I don't understand
this idiom.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.064
It's pronounced "idiot."

10:08.442 --> 10:11.486
Adam, I can handle
the spicier dishes

10:11.528 --> 10:13.071
because I grew up
with them,
but you did not.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.031
Oh.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.116
You...you...
You just went there.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.784
Huh?

10:17.825 --> 10:18.868
He just went there, Jen.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.328
He didn't go anywhere.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.289
Hey, challenge accepted.
Excuse me, sir.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.749
Lamb vindaloo,
level ten.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.960
Adam, you cannot
handle a ten.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.336
You know what?
You're right.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.713

10:31.756 --> 10:33.258
(EXHALES) But sir...
I said 12!

10:49.107 --> 10:50.358
Jack, stop that!

10:50.400 --> 10:53.194
Come on,
you're embarrassing me.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.862
Why are you so desperate
to try and fit in
with these people?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.573
Try?

10:56.615 --> 10:57.907
I already fit in
with these people.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.286
Maybe you're on
the wait list to fit in

11:01.328 --> 11:02.745
if 400 other...

11:03.413 --> 11:06.249
Oh, shut up.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.627
Audrey, remember
how I asked you
to pass these out,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.545
not put them on top
of the piano

11:10.587 --> 11:12.005
with a note that says,
"Take one"?

11:13.965 --> 11:15.300
(EXHALES) Fine.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.473
Hey. What have you
got on tap?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.560
Suffer through this,
maybe go home

11:25.602 --> 11:27.270
and take a run
at the old lady.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.857
Hmm, well,
if she's anything
like my wife, good luck.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.276
She is, and...thanks.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.615
So, uh, Marjorie,
what is your favorite
Franzen book?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.116
What?
Are those shrimp puffs?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.826
Oh, yeah.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.828
You, uh, both
might be wondering

11:43.870 --> 11:45.288
why I'm now serving
hors d'oeuvres,

11:45.330 --> 11:47.790
but I'm just doing a favor
for a friend,

11:47.832 --> 11:49.584
my surrogate, actually.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.710
Oh, can I give you
something?

11:51.752 --> 11:52.837
Oh, yeah, sure.

for that.

Audrey, I hate
to be all boss-like,

12:03.348 --> 12:05.099
but I'm gonna need
a little less talky

12:05.141 --> 12:06.267
and a little more walky.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.563

12:13.774 --> 12:16.236

12:16.277 --> 12:19.906
No wonder it's
so popular with India's
1.24 billion people.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.785
Mmm, look who stopped
watching porn long enough

12:24.827 --> 12:26.371
to look India up
on Wikipedia.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.208
Why are you treating
Russell this way?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.418
He's nothing
like you've been

12:31.459 --> 12:33.086
describing him
over the past year.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.296
What? Whatever could
he have said about me?

12:36.964 --> 12:40.009
You know, you're right.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.387
I should absolutely
appreciate the effort
he's made

12:42.429 --> 12:43.388
to know so much
about India.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.763
Mmm.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.641
Like, for example,
its capital city.

12:47.517 --> 12:50.228
Um, Calcutta, right?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.896
Yeah.
Ah-ha!

12:51.938 --> 12:54.691
Yeah, it was Calcutta
under the British  raj,

12:54.733 --> 12:57.402

of course, in 1911,
it became New Delhi.

with my fellow man,
I guess.

have to do this.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.265
No, I can handle it.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.266
I mean, you've seen me
bite into a bell pepper.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.894
Bell peppers aren't hot.
Not to me.

is disgusting.

circulate the fruit tarts?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.210

I have realized

14:37.251 --> 14:39.045
why these women
are not responding to me.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.797
It's this apron.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.382
They're seeing me
not as one of them.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.509
They're seeing me
as a worker.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.593
Hmm, glad someone's
seeing you as a worker.

Now, we are all back
on equal footing.

Oh.

we're not pooling tips.

that I didn't invite him
to this dinner,
