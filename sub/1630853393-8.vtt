00:06.006 --> 00:09.050
How do you bribe a juror
months before there's a jury panel?

00:09.134 --> 00:11.469
I don't know who he is
or anything about him.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.513
All I know is he's bought and paid for.

00:13.596 --> 00:17.809
"Judge Stanton, juror number seven is not
who you think he is or who he says he is."

00:17.892 --> 00:20.270
-No idea who it's from.
-Did we get him when he came in?

00:20.353 --> 00:21.855
Juror number seven
didn't show up this morning.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.857
Maybe juror number seven's dead.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.860
Did you think of that?
Maybe you and I are next.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.362
But Trevor Elliott
had gunshot residue on his hands.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.655
I have a plan.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.490
Call Tony Walsh,
invite him to this fundraiser.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.284
It's the internal audit
from the crime lab,

00:34.367 --> 00:36.244
They copied to my discovery by mistake.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.039
Now, there was a woman, Sonia Patel,
an old friend of Lara Elliott.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.166
-I'll find her.
-<i>I'll take care of that.</i>

00:41.249 --> 00:44.753
Nothing out of the ordinary on his GPS,
except for one place, a casino.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.254
Jerry like to gamble much?

00:46.337 --> 00:48.256
This is the security footage

00:48.339 --> 00:51.217
from outside the casino
that Jerry Vincent kept going to.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.845
Who's the other guy?
What papers did he hand over?

00:53.928 --> 00:56.514
-Tanya plays dumb--
-She's ready to go after Soto.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.099
Good. So am I.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.061
I drove him to a flower shop.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.146
The next day,
my friend was gone.

01:03.229 --> 01:07.108
Alvin Aquino. BNG ink, on parole for
attempted murder. Guess where he works?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.193
<i>Namayan Flowers.</i>

01:08.276 --> 01:11.696
You had to take that plea
because our star witness went missing.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.240
I really need your help
finding Glory Days again.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.117
-Everything all right?
-<i>It's my ex.</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:19.162
She posted photos partying
with some people we used to tour with,

01:19.245 --> 01:20.580
which means she's using again.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.583
Jerry had something,
which means there's something to have.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.212
And if he can find it,
I can fucking find it.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.374
You better make this worth my while.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.583
I don't do mornings.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.211
I'm sorry, I'm still in trial.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.881
It was the only time I had
and please, help yourself.

02:13.758 --> 02:14.968
I found Glory Days.

02:15.927 --> 02:16.761
How?

02:17.720 --> 02:19.430
My extensive surveillance network.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.225
I know a girl, who knows a girl,

02:22.308 --> 02:25.436
runs one of those
Girlfriend Experience operations.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.356
You asked me
what I'd do if I had to lay low?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.482
I'd do that.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.569
That's what Glory is doing. Out of Vegas.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.987
You have an address?

02:34.070 --> 02:36.030
No. No phone number neither,

02:36.114 --> 02:39.117
but I did find out
she comes back to LA every so often,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.493
see some of her regulars.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.414
And?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.189
This is one of her best clients.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.483
When he calls, she comes to town.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.489
-Thanks.
-Pleasure as always.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.118
Now, if we're done here,
girl's gotta get her sleep.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.459
Hey, Cherry,
take care of yourself, all right?

03:30.043 --> 03:30.919
Always.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.102
Now, back to the right.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.021
No, that's too far.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.731
To the left.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.650
Left.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.527
Everybody's got an opinion, huh?

03:56.611 --> 03:57.445
Yeah.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.031
You're so smart.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.827
Yeah?

04:04.911 --> 04:07.830
Can you meet me at court in 30 minutes?
I've got something for you.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.291
No problem. You ready for today?

04:10.375 --> 04:14.170
I've got the report Tony Walsh gave me.
That should handle the gunshot residue.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.296
Beyond that…

04:16.172 --> 04:18.549
You find more
about the guy at that casino with Jerry?

04:18.633 --> 04:19.717
Nope.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.136
And LAPD hit a wall, too,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.264
<i>but it's gotta mean something, right?</i>

04:24.889 --> 04:28.142
I don't know.
And I'm out of time to be chasing ghosts.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.645
Good luck.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.983
Are the People ready to proceed?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.776
The People call Sonia Patel.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.989
-What's going on?
-Nothing we weren't expecting.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.824
Objection. Sidebar, Your Honor?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.997
What's the problem, Counsel?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.208
Problem is that this witness
is not on the prosecution's list.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.918
As Counsel is aware,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.879
the witness recently
came to light via an article in the press.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.466
Mr. Haller spoke with her before I did.
He can't claim to be blindsided.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.761
That's how I know the witness has
no information about the murders.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.054
She had a front-row seat

05:05.138 --> 05:07.015
to the relationship
of the defendant and wife.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.141
Yeah, ten years ago.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.269
Sounds like something
you can bring out on cross.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.480
You can have
a standing objection, Mr. Haller.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.941
If the witness
has nothing of evidentiary value,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.777
I'll strike her testimony
and instruct the jury to disregard.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.988
Call your witness.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.782
Miss Patel,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.619
what was your relationship
with the defendant and his late wife?

05:28.703 --> 05:32.415
Lara and I were friends.
We worked together at Chaos Games.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.251
She and Trevor
were already dating by then.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.420
Did the three of you
spend time together?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.963
Quite a bit.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.257
I was basically
the third wheel for a while.

05:41.841 --> 05:42.967
Then what happened?

05:43.551 --> 05:46.929
Eventually, Trevor cut me off.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.184
He cut everyone off from Lara, one by one.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.269
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.645
This is a fact witness.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.106
Jury will disregard
anything that's her opinion.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.112
Miss Patel,

06:03.196 --> 06:06.783
did Lara Elliott confide in you
about her relationship with her husband?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.911
Yes. She told me
more than once that she felt like…

06:12.705 --> 06:14.332
Like he had taken over her life.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.709
How so?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.962
Lara was the best coder I ever knew.

06:20.546 --> 06:24.300
She could solve problems
none of the rest of us could crack.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.136
She should've been a superstar.

06:28.596 --> 06:33.434
Instead, Trevor put her
in his shadow and kept her there.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.352
Objection.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.812
Sustained.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.980
First-hand observations only, Counsel.

06:41.526 --> 06:45.488
What specifically did you witness
Mr. Elliott do to isolate his wife?

06:45.571 --> 06:49.700
For one, he encouraged her to quit
her job to start Parallax with him.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.371
But in fairness, Parallax has been
very successful, hasn't it?

06:53.454 --> 06:57.792
Yes, but Parallax
has always been all about Trevor.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.461
Lara might have enjoyed
the money, but it was Trevor's baby.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.379
I see.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.382
And did this all
impact your relationship with Lara?

07:04.465 --> 07:05.716
Absolutely.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.262
We were part
of the same circle of friends.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.973
Overnight, she suddenly ghosted all of us.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.184
When did you last hear from her?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.520
A few days before she died.

07:19.063 --> 07:19.939
She…

07:22.233 --> 07:24.110
She reached out to ask me to lunch.

07:25.361 --> 07:28.698
I was surprised,
I hadn't talked to her in years.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.494
We were supposed to meet
the day after she was murdered.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.834
Miss Patel,

07:40.877 --> 07:43.588
do you know
why Lara Elliott reached out to you?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.256
No.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.802
She just said she had something
to tell me and needed to do it in person.

07:50.511 --> 07:54.432
She wanted to meet sooner,
but I had a project to finish up at work.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.518
I've regretted that ever since.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.858
No further questions.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.943
You've got this, right?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.571
Get your hands off me,
Trevor, the jury's watching.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.118
When was the last time
you spoke to my client?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.371
I don't know. It's been years.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.583
Okay. When was
the last time you contacted him?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.252
I don't understand.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.839
Isn't it a fact
that you sent Mr. Elliott an email

08:26.923 --> 08:28.883
just after his wife reached out to you?

08:28.966 --> 08:30.551
Yes, but I never heard back.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.055
In that email,
didn't you propose to have lunch with him?

08:34.639 --> 08:38.476
I threw it out there.
I thought maybe we could bury the hatchet.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.229
Isn't it true
that you've emailed Mr. Elliott

08:41.312 --> 08:43.523
over 20 times in the last five years?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.983
Emails to which he has rarely responded?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.861
I suppose. It's called networking.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.740
So, even though you felt like
Mr. Elliott was controlling Lara's life,

08:53.407 --> 08:56.410
you still tried to use
your relationship for personal gain?

08:56.494 --> 08:57.411
Objection.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.329
I'll rephrase.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.957
You hoped Trevor
could help you in your career?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.667
-No.
-No?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.545
How long has it been
since you were promoted at Chaos Games?

09:05.628 --> 09:06.879
Relevance, Your Honor.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.673
It goes directly to her motivation

09:08.756 --> 09:11.467
for contacting
and testifying against my client.

09:12.927 --> 09:13.761
Overruled.

09:15.763 --> 09:16.764
So?

09:17.848 --> 09:20.393
It's been a few years, I guess.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.436
Six, to be exact.

09:22.520 --> 09:27.483
You were hoping Trevor would give you
a fresh start at Parallax, weren't you?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.776
It wasn't like that.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.154
Everyone's always on the lookout
for the next opportunity, but I--

09:32.238 --> 09:34.532
Trevor never offered you that opportunity?

09:35.616 --> 09:37.618
Not in terms of a job. No.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.790
Well, you must have
resented him terribly for that.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.917
-Objection.
-No further questions.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.140
We knew they'd move to dismiss.
We're just working on a way to counter.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.309
Without your witness, Soto walks.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.437
We believe we've identified
the shooter who killed my witness.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.690
We just need the contents of his phone.
It may link him to Soto.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.444
Maggie, you're out of time.
And frankly, you're too close to this.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.948
He had a little girl, Janelle.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.285
She lost her father
because I pressured him to testify.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.455
You did your job,
it didn't work out. It happens.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.665
Negative attention
that would accompany a loss--

10:24.749 --> 10:26.542
Wait. So this is about press?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.754
This is about
the next iteration of this office.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.841
The old saying. "Before you can
do any good, you gotta get elected first."

10:35.301 --> 10:39.639
Whatever you have,
nail it down this week, otherwise…

10:46.395 --> 10:47.229
So?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.941
End of the week. It'll take a month
to subpoena Alvin's phone carrier.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.110
He's on parole, be easy to get a warrant.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.696
We can't serve him a warrant.
It'll tip Soto off.

10:55.780 --> 11:00.451
Maybe there's a way to get
his phone without tipping anybody off.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.494
Like what?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.204
Give me a day.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.793
I'm Eric Loomis.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.046
I work as a forensic technician
for LA County crime laboratory.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.257
What role were you asked
to play in this investigation?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.843
I was asked
to conduct tests for gunshot residue,

11:17.927 --> 11:20.388
or as we call it, GSR, on the defendant.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.223
And what did you conclude?

11:22.306 --> 11:25.976
That Mr. Elliott had large amounts
of GSR on his hands and clothes.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.520
I see.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.691
Mr. Loomis, are there ever
any false positives for GSR?

11:32.274 --> 11:35.152
There can be,
generally due to transference.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.946
-Transference?
-Yes.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.615
Say, for instance,
you're in a police station.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.284
There might be stray particles
of GSR in an interview room

11:42.368 --> 11:45.788
if a detective had been
at the shooting range, but trace amounts.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.832
Nothing like this.

11:47.915 --> 11:52.002
Mr. Elliott's hands and clothes
were covered in GSR.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.715
So, given the amount of GSR
you found on the defendant,

11:55.798 --> 11:59.844
you were able to dismiss the possibility
this could've been a false positive.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.387
That's correct.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.466
Sir, that's a Gervasoni.

12:40.676 --> 12:44.555
You know, I got to admit,
I prefer the Maxalto.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.016
Superior wood working.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.268
Is there something I can help you with?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.186
Maybe.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.648
Does the name Glory Days ring a bell?

12:55.858 --> 12:56.776
I beg your pardon?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.569
She's a, uh…

12:59.820 --> 13:01.238
How can I put it delicately?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.700
…practitioner
of the world's oldest profession.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.330
-Mind you, I make no judgments.
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.458
-But I have to ask you to leave.
-No problem, Raj.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.379
I'll just head over to your house,
see if your wife knows anything about it

13:17.463 --> 13:20.424
or your mother-in-law.
She lives with you too, right?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.636
It should be enlightening.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.029
Three, two, one.

13:42.112 --> 13:45.324
Okay. What do you want? Money?

13:45.407 --> 13:46.867
Relax, Raj.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.705
You keep on fleecing the 1%.
I just need a little bit of your help.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.499
-With what?
-Make a date.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.377
Bring Glory Days back to town,

13:56.460 --> 14:01.131
and your little secret
is between you, me, the Gervasoni.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
During your time at the County crime lab,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.974
how many cases
would you say you've handled?

14:10.724 --> 14:11.767
I'd say hundreds.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.604
Was one of those cases
called <i>People vs. Oswaldo Ruiz?</i>

14:18.858 --> 14:21.777
-Yes, but--
-Objection. Relevance?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.613
It goes to the competence
of the witness, Your Honor.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.739
Overruled.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.035
Mr. Loomis, isn't it true
that the judge in the Ruiz case

14:30.119 --> 14:31.745
threw out your entire report?

14:31.829 --> 14:35.207
That was one case.
Like I said, I've worked hundreds.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.960
I'd like to enter
defense exhibit A, Your Honor.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.008
Sidebar, please, Your Honor?

14:47.636 --> 14:50.139
The People haven't been
given this document in discovery.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.809
Newly discovered evidence, Your Honor.
An anonymous whistleblower.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.896
Anonymous? Seriously?
There's no chain of custody.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.898
How do we know it's legitimate?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.526
Gee. I don't know, maybe I'll
ask the witness to verify it.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.611
Okay, stop it.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.071
You both
are throwing elbows with discovery.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.240
My tolerance is not infinite,

15:08.324 --> 15:10.826
but I'll allow Mr. Haller
to show the witness the exhibit.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.161
Thank you, Your Honor.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.247
Is this a copy
of the report you filed in the Ruiz case?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.584
The one that was thrown out by the court?

15:19.084 --> 15:21.378
-Yeah.
-And why was it thrown out?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.964
The defendant
had elements of GSR in his hands,

15:24.048 --> 15:27.092
but I failed to consider
he could've been exposed to them

15:27.176 --> 15:29.178
because of his work
as an industrial engineer.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.765
So, right before this case,
you filed a report that was so flawed,

15:32.848 --> 15:34.016
it was thrown out

15:34.099 --> 15:37.227
and now you want this jury
to accept your <i>expert</i> opinion?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.522
Well, it's not just my opinion.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.610
I'm sorry?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.029
This is professionally humiliating,

15:47.738 --> 15:50.866
but my supervisor, Dr. Tan,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.911
has been double-checking
all of my work since the Ruiz case.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.705
That's why her initials
are at the bottom of my report.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.333
Her initials?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.301
-Approach, Your Honor?
-Now what?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.432
My copy of the witness report
has no initials on it.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.401
It's true.
No initials on the defense's copy.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.948
It's simply a bad photocopy.
See where it's cut off at the bottom.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.575
There's just
the top of the initials there.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.539
Sorry, but we DAs don't have the resources
high-priced defense attorneys have.

16:38.622 --> 16:42.251
Are you representing to me as an officer
of the court, this an honest mistake?

16:42.334 --> 16:45.713
Absolutely, Your Honor.
I didn't know about the Ruiz case,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.549
so I would have no reason
to obscure the supervisor's initials.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.721
My apologies
to the court and to Mr. Haller.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.140
Your Honor, the jury--

16:56.223 --> 16:59.435
Mr. Haller, if you'd taken
the continuance the court had offered,

16:59.518 --> 17:02.646
perhaps you would've had time
to properly examine the document.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.606
The evidence stands.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.943
If you have any further questions
for this witness, ask.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.363
Otherwise, it's almost 4:30.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.295
"Nothing we weren't expecting."

17:26.378 --> 17:27.588
Were you expecting that?

17:27.671 --> 17:29.298
I told you we needed a continuance.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.675
You know full well
why that was impossible.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.594
This is my life, Mickey, and yours.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.597
The GSR is the most damning
evidence they have against you,

17:36.680 --> 17:38.140
you can't explain how it got there.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.850
I don't know.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.603
I reached down to touch my wife's body

17:42.686 --> 17:45.272
to see if there was
any chance she was still alive.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.232
Maybe that's how it got on my hands.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.151
The man said you were covered in it.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.195
It wasn't from firing a gun, Mickey.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.697
We had this case won
and you threw it away.

17:53.781 --> 17:54.740
No, that wasn't me.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.366
Fuck that. Of course, it was.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.576
Now look where we are.

17:57.659 --> 18:01.288
I wish Jerry was still my attorney
'cause at least he had a fucking plan.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.804
Heading home?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.014
The office.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.017
You can leave the car and go.
It's gonna be a long night.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.102
Copy that.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.151
We missed you
last night at the meeting.

18:32.986 --> 18:33.821
You went?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.829
My ex is in town,
doing a show. We had dinner.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.330
Oh, yeah? How did that go?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.624
Amazing.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.376
Awful.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.921
Sometimes both at once.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.344
But honestly, though,
better than I would've thought.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.056
That's good, then, right?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.434
Yeah.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.622
Okay, Mr. Geary,
that is enough for tonight.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.958
Hmm.

19:28.041 --> 19:28.917
What's "hmm"?

19:29.751 --> 19:32.462
Mickey told me
he was back working for the Road Saints,

19:32.546 --> 19:33.755
but there's no retainer.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.341
-You're going over the books?
-I'm curious.

19:36.925 --> 19:40.095
It's unlike Mickey
not to get his money in advance.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.015
Maybe they paid in cash
and it just hasn't shown up yet.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.642
Yeah. Maybe.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.852
-Cisco--

19:51.857 --> 19:52.816
What?

19:53.442 --> 19:54.443
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.909
Let's not bother him with this
until after the Elliott trial, okay?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.213
Hey.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.090
We're gonna head out.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.468
Unless you need anything.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.555
I left you some food in the refrigerator.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.265
Quinoa salad with beets.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.809
It's brain food, you eat too much meat.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.436
Do I?

20:31.688 --> 20:33.357
I'm missing something, Lorna.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.486
I've been
missing something since I got this case.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.862
Now, I have no time.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.990
Eli Wyms.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.158
What about him?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.619
The guy fires off
an arsenal at a bunch of cops.

20:45.702 --> 20:49.581
And you got him a plea deal
for illegal discharge of a firearm.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.458
That is crazy good.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.043
What are you saying, Lorna?

20:54.127 --> 20:55.170
I am saying

20:56.171 --> 20:58.924
that you are Mickey fucking Haller.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.427
You got this.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.055
Okay?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.879
<i>I think better on the road.</i>

22:19.463 --> 22:20.672
So you've said.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.801
One of the things about this job
is you can't just look at something once.

22:24.885 --> 22:29.222
You keep looking until you understand
every possible thing it could mean.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.601
Being in motion
helps me do that. I don't know why.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.645
To see what's right in front of you
is a constant struggle.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.105
Is that George Orwell?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.857
Mmm-mmm. My grandmother.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.526
Though now that you mention it…

24:36.391 --> 24:40.228
<i>I had this client once,</i>
<i>she was a burglar. Not just any burglar.</i>

24:40.312 --> 24:43.398
She was a safe cracker.
She used to tell me about it.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.401
The rush she got
when she solved the last digit

24:46.485 --> 24:47.986
and the gears started to move.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.490
<i>Finding out</i>
<i>what was inside the safe was secondary.</i>

24:51.573 --> 24:53.742
<i>'Cause the jobs weren't about the money.</i>

24:54.784 --> 24:58.830
<i>They were about that magic moment</i>
<i>when the gears click into place.</i>

25:00.373 --> 25:01.958
<i>I never cracked a safe.</i>

25:02.959 --> 25:04.836
<i>But I know all about that moment.</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:10.258
I found it. Jerry's magic bullet.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.095
I get it now, all of it. I get it.
And I need you two to help me fire it.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.514
Did you sleep here?

25:15.597 --> 25:18.016
Never mind.
The ballistics expert. What's her name?

25:18.099 --> 25:20.185
Dr. Arslanian. I sent her the file.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.771
But nothing she could say
would contradict the State's case.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.273
Don't worry.
Get her to court. I'll deal with it.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.443
Remember the guy from the video?
I know who he is. Bring him, too.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.153
All right, come on, let's go.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.780
Good. Come on.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.576
Mr. Muniz,
what do you do for a living?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.328
I'm a freelance videographer.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.579
Videographer of what?

25:40.914 --> 25:44.042
I monitor the police scanners
for high-profile crimes.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.420
Then I go shoot video
of the crime scenes and sell it to media.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.215
And did you shoot
any video relating to Trevor Elliott?

25:50.966 --> 25:51.800
I did.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.135
The defense would like to mark exhibit B.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.640
I shot for over an hour.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.518
But it's Mr. Elliott sitting
in the back of a patrol car

26:01.601 --> 26:03.186
until homicide detectives arrive.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.605
Was that the only video
you shot in Malibu that day?

26:05.689 --> 26:09.985
Well, that day, yes,
but I was also in Malibu the night before.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.572
-Why was that?
-Objection. What possible relevance?

26:13.655 --> 26:16.157
All will be revealed
in the fullness of time.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.076
Keep the fishing brief.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.539
There was an incident
around 2:00 a.m. up in Topanga State Park.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.083
A guy shot off rounds
at some Sheriff's deputies.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.127
Is that footage on here, too?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.044
Yes, sir.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.636
Objection, Your Honor. Again, relevance?

26:36.720 --> 26:39.264
This other footage
wasn't turned over in discovery.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.223
It was, actually.

26:40.307 --> 26:44.060
The entire contents of the footage
was put into evidence, Your Honor.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.271
It's not my fault
you didn't watch the whole thing.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.939
Get where you going.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.524
Almost there, Judge.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.320
You heard over your scanner
about a shooting in Topanga State Park?

26:53.403 --> 26:54.446
Yes.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.250
Recall the shooter's name?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.211
Uh, I believe it was Eli Wyms.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.839
He was a sniper in the Marines, I heard.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.259
Indeed, he was. Thank you, Mr. Muniz.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.011
No further questions, Your Honor.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.231
Mr. Muniz, I'm sorry,
but I'm just trying to connect the dots

27:30.315 --> 27:31.858
on how this has anything to do

27:31.941 --> 27:34.444
with the murders
of Lara Elliott and Jan Rilz.

27:34.527 --> 27:38.615
Were any of the same deputies involved
in the arrest of Mr. Wyms and Mr. Elliott?

27:39.658 --> 27:40.867
I don't think so.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.703
The two incidents
took place about 12 hours apart.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.830
So, are you aware

27:45.914 --> 27:48.708
of any connection at all
between these two crimes?

27:48.792 --> 27:50.960
No, sir. I just shot footage of both.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.422
Busy day for Malibu.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.465
Oh.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.592
No further questions.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.763
What the hell was that about?

28:17.445 --> 28:21.157
Mr. Aquino, I need you
to step out now so I can search you.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.742
Is there a problem, Officer?

28:22.826 --> 28:25.203
We ran your license,
came back you're on parole.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.331
That gives us the right to search
you and your vehicle for contraband.

28:28.415 --> 28:31.209
Step out of the vehicle.
Put your hands on your head.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.923
This is some bullshit.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.635
Focus on doing
what we tell you to do, sir.

28:50.019 --> 28:51.896
I'm telling you, I didn't do nothing.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.940
Then you'll be
on your way in no time.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.293
I can only buy you ten minutes.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.971
Cisco's about 15 minutes out.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
-All right.
-You sure this is gonna work?

29:28.349 --> 29:30.018
We're about to find out.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.147
All right, just fix that.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.277
<i>All rise.</i>

29:42.739 --> 29:43.865
Be seated.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.873
Mr. Haller, ready with your next witness?

29:52.957 --> 29:55.126
Yeah, actually, Your Honor.
I was just, uh…

29:55.794 --> 29:57.337
-I, uh…

29:57.921 --> 30:01.049
Can I have just one moment
to confer with a member of my staff?

30:01.132 --> 30:02.759
-Quickly.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.057
Thanks, man.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.391
Thank you, Your Honor.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.685
The defense
calls Dennis Byrne to the stand.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.480
Objection. Sidebar?

30:17.524 --> 30:20.109
This witness
was not on the defense's list.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.112
That's because
I just learned his name a few seconds ago.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.031
Putting on a witness
you've never spoken to?

30:25.114 --> 30:26.574
I know who he is.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.161
This isn't the first time somebody's
put on a witness that wasn't on the list.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.164
I haven't had time to prepare
for questioning this witness.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.875
That makes two of us.
We're in the same boat here.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.004
What's good for the goose, Mr. Golantz.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.924
-But this is it, Mr. Haller.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

30:50.139 --> 30:53.601
Can you please tell the jury
what you do for a living, Mr. Byrne?

30:54.269 --> 30:57.105
I work as a mechanic
for the LA County Sheriff's Office.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.607
-So, you maintain police cars?
-Yes.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.609
Those vehicles
got a lot of mileage.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.319
Must be a busy job.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.738
Some of them
are in use for three shifts a day.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.992
So yeah, keeping 'em
up and running keeps us pretty busy.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.578
Mr. Byrne,
I'd like to draw your attention

31:11.661 --> 31:14.205
back to the early morning
of September 6th.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.374
There was an incident
in Topanga State Park.

31:16.457 --> 31:19.252
A drunk ex-Marine
shot at some Sheriff's deputies,

31:19.335 --> 31:20.712
do you recall any of that?

31:20.795 --> 31:22.255
Yeah, I remember it.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.883
One of the SUVs
had its spotlight shot out.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.467
I brought the records with me.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.886
Objection. Relevance.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.806
Again, nobody is accusing
Trevor Elliott of firing at a police car.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.391
Get to the point, Mr. Haller.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.272
This is Mr. Wyms' arrest.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.404
Is that the same vehicle,
the one brought to you to be repaired?

31:47.030 --> 31:49.198
Yeah. You can see the shot out spotlight.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.494
How much time
did you have to repair that vehicle?

31:54.078 --> 31:56.372
An hour.
We needed to get it back on the street.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.332
I see.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.835
Do you normally
clean the cars that are brought to you?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.004
Exterior? Interior?

32:03.087 --> 32:06.341
Normally, but not this one.
Like I said, we only had an hour.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.302
All we could do
was repair the light and fill it with gas.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.431
Thank you. No further questions.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.816
I have no questions
for this witness.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.069
Witness is excused.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.030
Anyone else, Mr. Haller?

32:29.113 --> 32:33.159
Yes, Your Honor, the defense
calls Dr. Myriam Arslanian to the stand.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.791
Dr. Arslanian,
can you please tell the jury

32:39.874 --> 32:41.834
your area of expertise and credentials?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.503
I am a forensic scientist.

32:43.586 --> 32:48.675
I have a BA from Harvard in engineering
and a master's degree and PhD from MIT.

32:48.758 --> 32:49.968
Wow. Is that it?

32:51.886 --> 32:53.763
Actually, while I was at Harvard,

32:53.846 --> 32:56.933
I also got a bachelor's degree
from Berklee College of Music.

32:57.016 --> 33:00.186
-I went to both at the same time.
-You have a music degree, too?

33:00.269 --> 33:01.688
I like to sing.

33:01.771 --> 33:02.855
Ah.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.193
Your focus
in forensic science includes ballistics?

33:07.276 --> 33:08.319
It does.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.487
It's our lucky day

33:09.570 --> 33:11.990
because I have a report
from the County crime lab

33:12.073 --> 33:15.034
asserting that my client, Trevor Elliott,

33:15.118 --> 33:17.996
had a large amount
of gunshot residue on his hands.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.748
-Are you familiar with this?
-Yes, I've reviewed it.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.544
-What is your assessment of it?
-Oh. I agree with it. Absolutely.

33:24.627 --> 33:28.381
So, you agree that my client
had a large amount of gunshot residue

33:28.464 --> 33:30.717
on his hands and his clothes?

33:30.800 --> 33:32.301
A massive amount, actually.

33:32.385 --> 33:36.014
Much more than you'd normally have
from just firing a gun once or twice.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.474
Is there any way that Mr. Elliott

33:38.558 --> 33:41.644
could have gotten
that much gunshot residue on his hands

33:41.728 --> 33:43.229
without actually firing a gun?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.482
Only through what we call transference.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.817
Transference?

33:47.900 --> 33:50.194
I believe
the People's expert mentioned that.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.195
Can you elaborate?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.614
If you're exposed to something,

33:53.698 --> 33:56.034
you can pick it up
on your hands or clothes,

33:56.117 --> 34:00.371
but given
the amount of residue on Mr. Elliott,

34:00.455 --> 34:05.084
he would have to have been exposed
to a truly overwhelming amount of GSR.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.379
Dr. Arslanian,
I'd like you to take a look at this video.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.510
Do you see a man
being loaded into a Sheriff's vehicle?

34:14.594 --> 34:15.470
Yes.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.725
We established
that this man's name is Eli Wyms

34:20.808 --> 34:24.020
and that he fired
over 90 rounds of ammunition that night.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.814
He was then loaded
into the back of this patrol vehicle

34:26.898 --> 34:28.399
and driven to the County jail.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.318
Your Honor, I must object.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.986
I don't think so, Mr. Golantz.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.071
Overruled.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.866
Dr. Arslanian,
in a situation like I just described,

34:36.949 --> 34:38.618
how much gunshot residue

34:38.701 --> 34:41.579
would be transferred
into the backseat of that patrol car?

34:42.163 --> 34:45.249
If someone fired 90 rounds of ammunition,

34:45.333 --> 34:50.630
the amount of gunshot residue
would be off the charts.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.006
Objection. Speculation.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.341
Overruled.

34:53.424 --> 34:57.053
Can you please read the number
on the top of that patrol vehicle,

34:57.136 --> 34:59.180
the one with the spotlight shot out?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.890
Mmm-hmm. It says 112.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.558
112.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.024
This is my client, Trevor Elliott,

35:10.108 --> 35:13.611
being loaded into the back
of a Sheriff's vehicle 12 hours later.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.239
Can you read the number
on the top of that vehicle?

35:17.156 --> 35:18.199
It's 112.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.911
We established
that this vehicle was not cleaned

35:21.994 --> 35:26.541
between the time Mr. Wyms rode in it
and the time Mr. Elliott was placed in it.

35:27.166 --> 35:31.420
So, Dr. Arslanian, in your opinion,
could that account for the gunshot residue

35:31.504 --> 35:32.588
on my client's hands?

35:33.172 --> 35:37.218
In my opinion,
given the staggering amount of GSR,

35:37.301 --> 35:39.554
it's the only thing
that could account for it.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.113
What's it like, that moment?

35:57.613 --> 35:58.698
What moment?

35:59.365 --> 36:01.367
The moment when you know you've won.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.203
You never really know for sure.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.998
Sometimes,
it's not enough just to create doubt.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.375
If your client is the hero of the story,

36:10.042 --> 36:12.879
sometimes you gotta
give the jury a villain, too.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.469
Let's bring this home.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.976
Hello again, Detective Kinder.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.477
Counsel.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.770
Last time you were here,

36:29.854 --> 36:32.231
I asked you
about a man named Anton Shavar.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.149
Do you recall?

36:33.232 --> 36:34.150
Yes.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.068
I said
there was evidence Mr. Shavar

36:36.152 --> 36:38.613
threatened Jan Rilz
for having an affair with his wife.

36:38.696 --> 36:42.408
You told the court
you knew nothing about this, correct?

36:42.491 --> 36:43.659
That's correct.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.413
You know anything more
as you sit here today?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.834
I know that
no restraining order was ever granted.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.046
But you do know one was filed
by Mr. Rilz against Mr. Shavar.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.340
I'm now aware of that, yes.

36:57.423 --> 37:02.136
Now tell me something, Detective,
if you discover that a murder victim

37:02.220 --> 37:05.848
had filed for a restraining order
because someone threatened to kill him,

37:05.932 --> 37:09.727
wouldn't that be a strong lead
you would normally investigate?

37:09.810 --> 37:11.062
Of course it would.

37:11.145 --> 37:15.733
But as I already testified,
we weren't aware of Mr. Shavar until now.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.445
Does that mean
you still haven't questioned Mr. Shavar?

37:20.196 --> 37:21.030
Correct.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.407
Oh. No further questions.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.329
Did looking into Anton Shavar

37:28.412 --> 37:30.790
change your opinion
as to the defendant's guilt?

37:30.873 --> 37:32.083
No, it did not.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.251
And why is that?

37:33.334 --> 37:36.545
For one thing,
we looked into Mr. Shavar's whereabouts.

37:36.629 --> 37:41.717
Turns out, he was in Miami on business
during the time of the murders.

37:41.801 --> 37:46.013
Thank you. Nothing further.
Your Honor, may we approach?

37:46.597 --> 37:47.473
Mmm-hmm.

37:48.099 --> 37:48.933
At this rate,

37:49.016 --> 37:51.560
-I should start charging you both rent.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.981
It is obvious where this is going.
Mr. Haller intends to call Mr. Shavar

37:55.064 --> 37:56.482
to paint him as a straw man.

37:56.565 --> 37:57.775
Now you're reading my mind.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.027
If they wanted
to make this third-party culpability,

38:00.111 --> 38:02.655
they should've filed for it,
court would've held a hearing.

38:02.738 --> 38:04.824
They're trying to slip it
through the back door.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.618
If the police
had run a thorough investigation,

38:07.702 --> 38:08.869
I'm sure Jerry Vincent

38:08.953 --> 38:11.289
would've filed
a third-party motion months ago.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.749
People move
to suppress any third-party defense,

38:13.833 --> 38:15.960
both on procedural
and substantive grounds.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.253
I blew up your case.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.589
A case that was built
on exactly the same foundation as this,

38:20.673 --> 38:21.799
a husband scorned.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.384
The core of our entire defense

38:23.467 --> 38:25.928
has always been
that the police got tunnel vision.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.139
They got their man, they stopped looking.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.060
Call your witness.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.896
Please state your name.

38:36.814 --> 38:37.982
Anton Shavar.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.900
What do you do, Mr. Shavar?

38:40.693 --> 38:43.321
I run a private security
and intelligence firm.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.905
That's an interesting job.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.407
How did you get into that?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.410
I have a background
in intelligence in Israel.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.954
So you were in the Mossad?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.332
I did not say that.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.084
But I need you to answer the question.
Were you in the Mossad?

38:57.168 --> 39:00.463
An organization known
to carry out targeted assassinations.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.673
-Objection!
-Your Honor, if I may?

39:04.383 --> 39:05.468
Who are you?

39:05.551 --> 39:07.011
I'm Mr. Shavar's counsel.

39:07.094 --> 39:09.263
Mr. Shavar's past employment in Israel,

39:09.347 --> 39:12.266
whatever it may be,
has no bearing on this case.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.312
It could jeopardize the national security
of one of this country's closest allies.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.190
It's all right. I'll take that as a yes.

39:19.273 --> 39:20.524
Move to strike.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.487
Granted. The jury
will disregard Mr. Haller's last remark.

39:25.571 --> 39:29.408
Very well, let's move on.
What was your relationship with Jan Rilz?

39:30.242 --> 39:33.496
I didn't have one.
We only met that one time.

39:33.579 --> 39:34.914
When you threatened to kill him?

39:34.997 --> 39:38.417
I didn't threaten to kill him.
I told him to stay away from my wife.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.252
Because you learned

39:40.336 --> 39:43.130
that he was having
an affair with your wife?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.383
Now my ex-wife, but yes.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.426
I apologize. Now your ex-wife.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.804
Did learning
about her affair with Mr. Rilz

39:49.887 --> 39:51.430
play any role in your divorce?

39:51.514 --> 39:54.016
-What the hell do you think?
-Mr. Shavar.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.684
Apologies, Your Honor.

39:57.353 --> 40:00.731
This is not a pleasant experience
talking about the worst thing in my life

40:00.815 --> 40:02.566
to a room full of strangers.

40:04.735 --> 40:08.823
Yes. My wife's infidelity
played a role in our divorce.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.909
How did you learn about the affair?

40:12.660 --> 40:13.786
A husband knows.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.454
You had her followed?

40:19.458 --> 40:21.877
-Yes.
-By employees of your company?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.421
I pay them for their time.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.340
And after they confirmed
that your wife was cheating,

40:26.424 --> 40:29.385
you went to confront
Jan Rilz at his yoga studio?

40:29.468 --> 40:31.011
To tell him to stay away.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.055
All you said was "Stay away"?

40:33.139 --> 40:36.767
That's enough to get a man to apply
for a restraining order against you?

40:36.851 --> 40:40.229
I was angry.
I imagine I used some strong language.

40:40.896 --> 40:45.443
But I was in Miami on the day
Mr. Rilz was murdered. You know this.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.237
I also know
your employees trailed your ex-wife.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.656
-Were they in Mossad?
-Objection, Your Honor.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.658
On what basis? Too much relevance?

40:52.741 --> 40:55.035
Sustained. Careful, Mr. Haller.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.332
How many of your employees
are licensed to carry a gun?

41:01.375 --> 41:02.668
All of them, naturally.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.920
We provide high-level security,

41:05.838 --> 41:08.090
but that doesn't make me a violent man.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.967
So you're not a violent man?

41:10.676 --> 41:13.345
No. I'm a careful man.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.308
Right. Your Honor, the defense
would like to enter defense exhibit G.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.854
Funny. I must not have that one.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.064
It's impeachment evidence, Your Honor.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.067
Mr. Shavar
testified that he's not a violent man.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.612
I have a video
that directly impeaches that.

41:30.905 --> 41:31.822
Thank you.

41:34.366 --> 41:37.703
<i>You come near me or my family again,</i>
<i>I'll break you like a toy.</i>

41:39.079 --> 41:40.206
<i>Is that a gun?</i>

41:40.289 --> 41:42.416
<i>You don't wanna find out.</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:44.585
<i>Stay the fuck away from my wife!</i>

41:47.296 --> 41:52.176
So you didn't just confront Mr. Rilz,
you confronted my investigator as well.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.845
I was simply making a point.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.306
-By threatening to kill him?
-Objection!

41:57.389 --> 42:00.059
Withdrawn.
No further questions, Your Honor.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.525
I have two questions for you, Mr. Shavar.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.901
Did you kill Jan Rilz?

42:08.984 --> 42:10.444
Of course not.

42:11.028 --> 42:14.406
Did you instruct any of your staff
or anyone to kill Jan Rilz?

42:15.491 --> 42:16.742
Absolutely not.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.202
Thank you.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.452
You know for a fact
I had nothing to do with this.

43:02.037 --> 43:03.455
The things I know for a fact

43:03.539 --> 43:05.666
are things
that happen in front of my face.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.129
I have a reputation, a business.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.007
I have people who work for me,

43:13.090 --> 43:15.509
who rely on my good name
to keep them employed.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.845
Did you think about any of that

43:17.928 --> 43:20.472
before you decided
to drag that name through the mud?

43:21.056 --> 43:23.642
All I did
was ask you some questions, Mr. Shavar.

43:25.769 --> 43:28.856
Lawyers, you're all the fucking same.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.828
Good news is,
from the GPS on his phone,

43:42.911 --> 43:46.790
we were able to track down Aquino
to within quarter mile of the murder site

43:46.874 --> 43:48.584
ten minutes before it happened.

43:48.667 --> 43:49.543
But?

43:49.627 --> 43:53.464
At that point, he either turned off
his phone or the battery died.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.132
We don't have a signal after that.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.636
Sounds like a man with something to hide.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.639
It's circumstantial.
But yeah, guy's our shooter.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.848
He's gotta be.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.811
Can I ask you something?
What did they pull him over for?

44:09.271 --> 44:10.814
Busted tail light, I think.

44:11.565 --> 44:12.608
How'd it get busted?

44:12.691 --> 44:14.318
How the hell would I know?

44:15.611 --> 44:17.321
Spent my rookie years in South LA.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.907
Some cops,
they wanna search a gangbanger's car,

44:19.990 --> 44:21.450
they got all kinds of tricks.

44:22.701 --> 44:24.161
You're accusing me of something?

44:24.870 --> 44:26.664
Did politics finally get into you?

44:26.747 --> 44:28.415
No, just need this to be airtight.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.167
Bottom line, it doesn't matter.

44:30.250 --> 44:33.045
There's not enough
on the phone to nail down Aquino.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.964
We gotta go old school,
we gotta get him to turn on Soto.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.972
I don't know how to thank you.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.893
Well, you paid me.
That's a pretty good start.

44:50.229 --> 44:54.108
I'm sorry for what I said,
about wishing Jerry was still my lawyer.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.735
He was a good attorney.

44:57.695 --> 44:58.696
But you…

45:01.490 --> 45:02.991
I appreciate that, Trevor.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.578
And it's okay.
You're under a lot of pressure.

45:06.662 --> 45:10.666
The good news is,
today I think we got to reasonable doubt.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.920
We gave the jury somebody else
to blame. That's all we needed to do.

45:15.003 --> 45:17.047
I agree. Almost all.

45:19.007 --> 45:20.384
What do you mean?

45:21.844 --> 45:25.055
I told you. I need to win
in the court of public opinion, too.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.891
And I told you
that no lawyer can give you that.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.269
Of course, only I can do that.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.812
That's why I need to testify.

45:33.021 --> 45:35.190
Trevor, what are you talking about?

45:35.274 --> 45:36.108
We won.

45:36.191 --> 45:38.777
Your investors
are gonna get what they want.

45:38.861 --> 45:42.197
Yeah, but I won't.
Not if I don't clear my name.

45:42.865 --> 45:46.702
Trevor, listen, don't do this, all right?

45:46.785 --> 45:48.328
-He will--

45:53.375 --> 45:55.127
-What are you doing?
-I have to go.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.670
Go? Go where?

45:57.296 --> 45:58.756
We'll discuss this tomorrow.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.049
Terrell?

46:01.133 --> 46:03.552
It's Mickey Haller. I need your help.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.936
-My man.
-What up, Terrell?

46:13.020 --> 46:16.857
This is the guy I was telling you about.
He gotta pop backstage for a second.

46:17.649 --> 46:18.692
This is for you.

46:19.985 --> 46:20.944
Damn.

46:23.405 --> 46:25.240
-Come on.
-I owe you one.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.325
We're cool.

46:26.408 --> 46:30.204
I told you, Mickey Haller,
anytime you need me, I'm there.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.298
What happened, Izzy?

47:27.219 --> 47:28.929
She asked me to get high with her.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.766
I came within a millimeter of saying yes.

47:37.145 --> 47:39.273
That's still
on the right side of the line.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.985
Come on, let's go. Come on.
