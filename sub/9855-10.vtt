11:16.030 --> 11:17.197
[Firing]

11:17.231 --> 11:18.532
[Glass shatters]

11:21.536 --> 11:23.503
I see your little pal's
given you a gun.

11:23.538 --> 11:25.721
A five-round snubby?

11:27.074 --> 11:29.442
Two down. Game on!

11:33.447 --> 11:35.016
[Stumbles, clattering] Damn!

11:35.136 --> 11:36.243
[Fires]

11:37.385 --> 11:38.285
That's three!

11:38.791 --> 11:39.863
Two left!

[Shoots]

11:51.766 --> 11:53.800
[Returns fire]

11:55.069 --> 11:57.170
You're not
a very good shot, Carl.

11:57.205 --> 11:58.638
Why is that?

12:10.251 --> 12:12.519
Drop it.

12:15.756 --> 12:17.390
[Blow thuds heavily]

12:26.167 --> 12:28.401
Take that, big fella, huh?

12:30.438 --> 12:31.271
[Shoots]

12:32.140 --> 12:33.440
[Gun clicks uselessly]

12:34.475 --> 12:36.257
That's five,

12:36.377 --> 12:37.818
garbage boy.

12:38.446 --> 12:40.447
You're empty.

12:40.481 --> 12:42.282
You're done.

12:43.251 --> 12:44.818
[Blows thud]

12:49.390 --> 12:50.290
[Stuffed animals squeak]

13:03.471 --> 13:04.571

13:04.605 --> 13:06.597
Where you going, man?

13:13.581 --> 13:15.382
[Groans in pain]

13:23.190 --> 13:24.857
Police! That's enough.

13:24.892 --> 13:26.526
Shoot him!

13:26.560 --> 13:27.861
Shoot him, Seeger!

13:27.895 --> 13:28.862
Police!

13:28.896 --> 13:29.929
He knows who you are,

13:29.964 --> 13:31.197
just bloody shoot him!

13:32.299 --> 13:33.299
[Fires]

13:35.670 --> 13:36.670
[Groans in pain]

13:36.704 --> 13:38.271
Are you all right?

13:38.306 --> 13:40.473
Aye. Just wearing him out,
you know.

13:40.508 --> 13:42.509
"Shoot him, shoot him!"

13:42.543 --> 13:43.510
It was pretty high-pitched

13:43.544 --> 13:44.744
for someone
who's wearing him out.

13:44.779 --> 13:46.213
Is that girl all right?

13:46.247 --> 13:48.381
Yeah, the ambulance
is taking care of her.

13:48.416 --> 13:49.549
There's more backup on the way.

13:49.584 --> 13:51.485
[Seeger]: Where's Hickman?

13:51.519 --> 13:52.586
Come on...

13:52.620 --> 13:55.856
we both knew
it was going to end this way.

13:55.890 --> 13:56.990
I mean...

13:57.024 --> 14:01.361
you don't want to live anymore
anyway, right?

14:01.395 --> 14:04.464
I mean, you're a cop...

14:06.501 --> 14:08.535
Who can't even hold a gun.

14:09.656 --> 14:12.672
I might as well have
just cut your balls off.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.343
[Fires]

14:37.177 --> 14:38.846
Hickman. You all right.

14:39.725 --> 14:40.702
He's not dead.

14:40.736 --> 14:41.570
Cuff him!

14:41.604 --> 14:42.604
Now!

14:42.638 --> 14:43.772
[Sobbing desperately]
Right now!

14:43.806 --> 14:45.674
All right, she's got him,
she's got him.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.842
She's cuffing him, all right?

14:46.876 --> 14:49.945
The adrenaline's pumping,
I can't...

14:49.979 --> 14:51.580
What do you mean, man?

14:51.614 --> 14:53.515
When the ambulance gets here,

14:53.549 --> 14:55.817
you tell them
that I think I did...

14:55.852 --> 14:56.718
I think I did heroin.

14:56.752 --> 14:57.819
What?

14:57.854 --> 15:00.922
Yeah, I think
a large... a large dose.

15:00.957 --> 15:02.290
It might be lethal.
You tell them...

15:02.325 --> 15:03.592
Tommy...

15:03.626 --> 15:05.627
Tommy, they gotta counter it,

Okay, man, all right...

15:10.566 --> 15:12.334
<i>Hickman, hold on!</i>

15:26.950 --> 15:28.183
No sign of him?

15:28.218 --> 15:29.385
None.

15:29.419 --> 15:30.786
His car is
in the garage, though.

15:30.820 --> 15:32.588
So he was here.

15:32.622 --> 15:34.356
What was he working on?

15:34.391 --> 15:38.327
Louis? No,
this wasn't him.

15:38.361 --> 15:39.295
I'm sorry?

15:39.329 --> 15:40.596
This was something
I was working on.

15:40.630 --> 15:43.814
Something that appears
to be out of control.

15:43.934 --> 15:45.234
Would you care to explain?

15:45.268 --> 15:46.301
No, not to you.

15:46.336 --> 15:50.572
When Louis was still
with the 36,

15:50.607 --> 15:54.176
he was working on
a very large drug case.

15:54.710 --> 15:56.077
There were some arrests?

15:56.112 --> 15:57.846
Not that I...

15:57.880 --> 16:00.148
Yes. Heroin poppies

16:00.183 --> 16:01.416
from Afghanistan.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.218
There were maybe
30 arrests made.

16:03.252 --> 16:04.819
You know
the investigation very well?

16:04.854 --> 16:06.688
I didn't work on it.

16:06.722 --> 16:08.823
Is there someone around
who did?

16:09.342 --> 16:11.193
Doesn't work
in the field anymore.

16:11.227 --> 16:12.767
Well, where can I find him?

16:12.887 --> 16:13.523
Her.

16:13.643 --> 16:14.507
Uh...

16:16.316 --> 16:17.441
At the office.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.768
She was made a clerk
not long after.

16:27.077 --> 16:29.364
Remember the first time
you tried to kiss me?

16:30.805 --> 16:32.715
I turned away.

16:35.819 --> 16:40.494
I wanted you so bad,
but... this...

16:41.725 --> 16:43.192
this... I'm so sorry.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.663
Everything,

16:47.697 --> 16:50.197
every woman
I ever get close to...

16:51.434 --> 16:52.334
gets hurt.

16:54.204 --> 16:57.506
Please get better.

16:57.541 --> 17:00.342
Get better and forgive me.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.093
There he is.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.262
You feeling better?

17:21.298 --> 17:23.244
Couldn't feel too much worse.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.201
Looks like you could
say the same.

17:26.234 --> 17:28.069
Ah, no worries.

17:28.104 --> 17:29.438
I've got a hard head.

17:29.472 --> 17:30.472
Just like him.

17:31.141 --> 17:31.774
Has he woken up yet?

17:31.808 --> 17:33.142
Not a peep.

17:33.176 --> 17:34.643
You gave him a good concussion.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.178
.45'll do that.

17:36.213 --> 17:37.827
Wanna tell me who he is?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.342
He runs a trafficking ring.

17:40.462 --> 17:41.291
Drugs?

17:41.411 --> 17:42.503
People...

17:42.623 --> 17:43.730
Kids.

17:44.483 --> 17:45.295
Bastard.

17:45.415 --> 17:46.489
They used the carnival.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.290
Snatch a kid in one area,

17:48.325 --> 17:50.392
put him through
the carnie network,

17:50.427 --> 17:51.883
kid's out of the country
in a day.

17:52.003 --> 17:53.040
What country?

17:53.321 --> 17:55.564
All over.
Europe...

17:55.599 --> 17:57.233
Asia...

17:57.267 --> 17:59.137
North America.

17:59.669 --> 18:01.772
He's who did this.

18:03.740 --> 18:04.573
Should have killed him.

18:04.608 --> 18:06.842
It's good that he lived.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.811
I got a lot of questions
for him.

18:08.845 --> 18:11.465
I'm trying to update the major,

18:11.585 --> 18:13.582
but I can't get ahold of him.

18:13.617 --> 18:14.617
Don't bother,

18:14.651 --> 18:16.318
I quit yesterday.

18:16.353 --> 18:18.120
Yeah, but I didn't.

18:18.154 --> 18:19.855
And I shot a bloke
and beat up another one.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.823
Beat him up?

18:21.820 --> 18:24.560
Yeah, well, until she came in
and shot him in the knee.

18:24.594 --> 18:26.328
Still, that's gonna
mean paperwork

18:26.363 --> 18:28.430
somewhere down the line.

18:28.465 --> 18:30.666
Well, good luck with that.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.469
It's weird, though.

18:33.503 --> 18:36.272
First, Anne-Marie,
now the major.

18:36.306 --> 18:37.581
No word on her?

18:37.701 --> 18:38.874
No.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.243
Eva and Sebastian
went through all her files,

18:41.278 --> 18:43.345
then they went to Calais.

18:43.380 --> 18:47.449
I just talked to them,
but... nothing.

18:47.484 --> 18:49.385
They're on their way back now.

18:51.788 --> 18:53.155
Can I ask you something?

18:53.190 --> 18:54.690
Of course.

18:54.724 --> 18:56.659
What kind of things
were in your files?

18:56.693 --> 18:58.327
Excuse me?

18:58.361 --> 18:59.228
I mean, not the scangen,

18:59.262 --> 19:00.696
but you told me that

19:00.730 --> 19:02.164
you also have
personal stuff, too.

19:02.199 --> 19:03.199
Very.

19:03.233 --> 19:04.700
Like what?

19:04.734 --> 19:08.337
Well, I think the word
"personal" sums it up nicely.

19:08.371 --> 19:09.872
Okay, sorry.
I was just curious.

19:09.906 --> 19:10.873
I'm a woman.

19:10.907 --> 19:13.897
[Sighing] Aw, what the hell?

19:18.436 --> 19:20.140
_

19:22.419 --> 19:25.397
This officer has quite
an impressive record.

19:25.517 --> 19:27.856
There were also problems.

19:27.891 --> 19:31.664
Why was she removed
from the field?

19:31.784 --> 19:32.786
Sex.

19:38.049 --> 19:39.422
Excuse me?

19:39.542 --> 19:41.437
I had an affair
with a superior.

19:41.471 --> 19:45.374
She was made a clerk
to safe the unit embarrassment.

19:45.408 --> 19:47.209
And what happened to
the superior?

19:47.244 --> 19:48.577
He was promoted.

19:50.013 --> 19:52.381
Well, be that as it may,
I need your help.

19:52.415 --> 19:53.716
My help?

19:53.750 --> 19:55.618
I'm from the ICC,

19:55.652 --> 19:58.354
and I'm looking for a man
who may be in grave danger,

19:58.388 --> 20:00.585
a man with whom you worked
at one time.

20:00.705 --> 20:01.724
Who?

20:01.758 --> 20:02.925
Louis Daniel.

20:03.569 --> 20:06.562
He and his wife
appear to be missing.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.463
Appear to be?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.365
They both may be in trouble,

20:09.399 --> 20:11.767
or she is missing,

20:11.802 --> 20:13.502
and he's trying to find her,

20:13.537 --> 20:15.504
or they're both
in hiding somewhere,

20:15.539 --> 20:17.573
but I don't believe
I have the luxury of waiting

20:17.607 --> 20:18.574
to find out.

20:18.608 --> 20:19.608
Who would be after him?

20:19.643 --> 20:23.245
A man that you apparently
helped him with

20:23.280 --> 20:24.413
an investigation of.

20:24.447 --> 20:27.492
Alexander Dimitrov?

20:27.951 --> 20:28.951
Exactly.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.655
Then you're right.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.315
He's in a lot of trouble.

20:37.553 --> 20:39.813
Wow, it's a bad accident, huh?

20:40.528 --> 20:42.268
It's pretty burned up.

20:49.131 --> 20:51.065
Excuse me.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.406
What's wrong?

20:58.440 --> 21:00.475
This car.

21:02.544 --> 21:04.512
It could be Anne-Marie's.

21:10.049 --> 21:11.016
[Monitors beeping steadily]

21:11.050 --> 21:12.918
[Genovese groans]

21:13.853 --> 21:15.554
Over here.

21:18.491 --> 21:21.426
I'm probably
the one in the middle.

21:21.461 --> 21:24.630
I can't...

21:24.664 --> 21:28.400
I'm-I'm numb up here.

21:28.434 --> 21:30.669
Did...

21:30.703 --> 21:32.571
Did you shoot me in the head?

21:35.742 --> 21:37.643
And I lived?

21:40.947 --> 21:43.024
You can't kill me.

21:43.983 --> 21:46.885
My old partners in New York,

21:46.920 --> 21:50.306
they're putting together the
extradition papers right now.

21:50.426 --> 21:52.825
You'll be there
end of the week.

21:52.859 --> 21:55.294
You have any idea the minimums
you're gonna do

21:55.328 --> 21:57.784
for child abduction
and trafficking?

21:59.833 --> 22:02.434
And trust me,

22:02.469 --> 22:06.572
upstate New York
is not the place

22:06.606 --> 22:09.508
a short eyes like you
wants to do time.

22:09.542 --> 22:12.077
I ain't no short eyes.

22:12.112 --> 22:13.946
I never touched those kids.

22:13.980 --> 22:14.780
I found them

22:14.814 --> 22:16.081
on the street...

22:16.115 --> 22:17.349
Do you think
anybody gives a crap

22:17.383 --> 22:18.973
about that distinction?

22:19.796 --> 22:21.968
When you're sentenced,

22:22.088 --> 22:24.323
and you take that walk
from the defendant's table

22:24.357 --> 22:26.925
to the tombs...

22:28.695 --> 22:30.062
the last thing
that you're gonna see

22:30.096 --> 22:33.532
before you go into the tank

22:33.566 --> 22:35.601
will be me...

22:37.103 --> 22:38.604
Smiling,

22:38.638 --> 22:41.607
from ear to ear.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.750
By the way,

22:51.785 --> 22:54.720
I thought about
just killing you.

22:55.889 --> 22:57.789
But what could be worse

22:57.824 --> 22:59.825
than leaving you
to live the life

22:59.859 --> 23:01.894
you're going to live?

23:04.620 --> 23:07.633
We arrested
28 members of the gang,

23:07.667 --> 23:09.635
most of them small players.

23:09.669 --> 23:12.771
The highest we got
was mid-level distribution.

23:12.806 --> 23:14.807
Why no higher?

23:14.841 --> 23:16.708
Dimitrov killed
everyone above them.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.010
Everyone?

23:18.044 --> 23:19.511
Within 24 hours.

23:19.546 --> 23:21.901
The entire operation.

23:22.021 --> 23:24.571
Traffickers,
importers, exporters.

23:24.691 --> 23:26.100
From Paris, to Afghanistan,

23:26.220 --> 23:27.049
to Russia.

23:27.169 --> 23:28.454
Dozens of people.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.854
He sacrificed them all

23:29.889 --> 23:31.523
to keep us as far from him
as possible.

23:31.557 --> 23:33.391
Is that unusual?

23:33.426 --> 23:34.392
Not for him.

23:34.427 --> 23:36.912
- So this has happened before?
- This?

23:37.032 --> 23:38.352
A drug ring connected to him

23:38.472 --> 23:39.776
has been broken up?

23:39.896 --> 23:41.032
It happens all the time.

23:42.101 --> 23:45.036
Then why?

23:45.071 --> 23:47.809
Why has he gone after Louis
so personally?

23:47.929 --> 23:49.057
Mr. Dorn?

23:49.177 --> 23:51.009
Dorn. Just Dorn.

23:51.043 --> 23:52.344
He's on the phone for you.

23:52.378 --> 23:54.012
Louis?

23:54.046 --> 23:55.213
Dimitrov.

23:55.248 --> 23:57.482
In Commissaire Laveaux's
office.

23:58.451 --> 24:00.151
When did this accident happen?

24:00.186 --> 24:01.387
Two nights ago.

24:01.507 --> 24:04.022
Another motorist noticed
a fire below the embankment

24:04.056 --> 24:05.824
and called it in.

24:05.858 --> 24:07.025
By the time I got here,

24:07.059 --> 24:08.860
the fire brigade
had the flames all out.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.395
Where's the driver?

24:10.429 --> 24:11.563
There was a body.

24:11.597 --> 24:12.998
It was burnt badly.

24:13.032 --> 24:14.232
Was that a female?

24:14.267 --> 24:16.902
I couldn't honestly
even tell you that.

24:16.936 --> 24:18.103
Did you take
the license plates?

24:18.137 --> 24:19.204
There were none.

24:19.238 --> 24:22.040
And the driver's
identification burnt up.

24:23.276 --> 24:25.443
The body is still unidentified.

24:25.478 --> 24:27.834
[Sebastian]: There
are footprints!

24:28.314 --> 24:29.314
I can't tell for sure,

24:29.348 --> 24:30.415
but it looks like
someone walked away.

24:30.449 --> 24:32.350
There was a body, Sebastian.

24:33.886 --> 24:36.454
Not necessarily hers.

24:36.489 --> 24:38.056
Dammit, if I had my equipment,

24:38.090 --> 24:39.858
we could use it
to follow the traces.

24:39.892 --> 24:42.060
Is this the phone?

24:42.094 --> 24:44.896
We're almost ready to trap
and trace that call.

24:44.931 --> 24:46.498
He called me.

24:46.532 --> 24:48.233
You think he cares about
being traced?

24:48.267 --> 24:50.268
Still, I think
we'd better trace it.

24:50.303 --> 24:52.337
As long as he has
Rebecca and Louis,

24:52.371 --> 24:53.462
he has the upper hand.

24:53.582 --> 24:56.792
No one is to do anything
that might jeopardize them.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.210
You have no authority here.

24:58.244 --> 24:59.611
That may be so,

24:59.645 --> 25:02.447
but I promise you I am not
the man you want as an enemy.

25:02.481 --> 25:03.982
We won't need
to trace the call anyway.

25:04.016 --> 25:05.050
What?

25:05.084 --> 25:06.084
He wants a meeting.

25:06.118 --> 25:07.352
How do you know...

25:07.386 --> 25:08.987
Why else would he call, sir?

25:09.696 --> 25:12.891
This is a show he's putting on.

25:12.925 --> 25:14.526
Now, if you'll take
your hand away,

25:14.560 --> 25:15.994
I will indulge him.

25:18.598 --> 25:20.065
[Music pounding]

25:20.099 --> 25:21.633
<i>This is Dorn.</i>

25:21.667 --> 25:24.002
I've wanted for quite some time
to talk to you.

25:24.036 --> 25:26.171
You might have called
my office.

25:26.205 --> 25:27.339
I'm in the telephone book.

25:27.373 --> 25:30.308
I needed to really
get your attention first.

25:30.343 --> 25:32.444
Then you have it... fully.

25:32.478 --> 25:34.546
The address is popping up

25:34.580 --> 25:36.081
on inspector Claire's
cell phone now.

25:36.115 --> 25:37.983
[Cell phone beeps]

25:43.956 --> 25:45.156
When?

25:45.191 --> 25:46.358
One hour.

25:51.164 --> 25:52.397
Did you know
he had your cell number?

25:52.431 --> 25:53.198
No.

25:53.232 --> 25:54.666
It's more show.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.369
He wants to meet me in an hour.

25:57.403 --> 26:00.372
Would you like someone
to come with you, sir?

26:00.406 --> 26:02.240
No, thank you.

26:02.275 --> 26:04.509
But I would appreciate
a backup team nearby.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.678
Do you think you might
arrange that, Commissaire?

26:06.712 --> 26:08.113
I'll see who I can spare.

26:08.147 --> 26:10.182
Thank you.

26:10.216 --> 26:11.449
Thank you, Moreau.

26:19.725 --> 26:21.754
So, what else happened?

26:21.874 --> 26:23.995
About?

26:24.030 --> 26:26.398
Well, a sex scandal
in a Parisian police unit

26:26.432 --> 26:30.268
doesn't usually
raise an eyebrow.

26:30.303 --> 26:33.004
When Commissaire Laveaux
took over,

26:33.039 --> 26:36.107
he thought everything
came with the job.

26:36.142 --> 26:37.642
Everything?

26:37.677 --> 26:39.544
Including me.

26:39.579 --> 26:41.680
I stabbed his hand
with a letter opener

26:41.714 --> 26:43.648
the first time
he reached for me.

26:43.683 --> 26:46.218
So...

26:46.252 --> 26:52.123
The affair that you had
was with the former Commissaire?

26:55.428 --> 26:57.128
Be careful, sir.

26:58.431 --> 27:01.032
I will be.

27:01.067 --> 27:03.368
Thank you.

27:03.402 --> 27:05.437
Have you told the major?

27:07.340 --> 27:11.042
No, I can't
get ahold of him either.

27:11.077 --> 27:12.244
[Sighs]
All right, just...

27:12.278 --> 27:15.513
 stay there until
you hear from...

27:15.548 --> 27:17.282
I don't know, someone.

27:19.151 --> 27:20.418
What's up?

27:20.453 --> 27:21.653
That was Eva.

27:21.687 --> 27:24.222
Her and Sebastian found a wreck
from two days ago,

27:24.257 --> 27:25.090
a burned up car.

27:25.124 --> 27:26.057
And?

27:26.092 --> 27:27.726
She's sure it's Anne-Marie's.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.160
Where was the accident?

27:29.195 --> 27:31.296
Outside South Holland,
not far from...

27:34.200 --> 27:35.500
What is it?

27:35.535 --> 27:38.603
There's a body
in the north Holland morgue,

27:38.638 --> 27:40.541
an unidentified female
from an accident

27:40.661 --> 27:41.841
burned beyond identification.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.341
She's been there two days.

27:43.376 --> 27:44.709
Oh, God...

27:45.755 --> 27:46.686
Tommy, wait...

27:46.806 --> 27:47.612
No!

27:47.647 --> 27:49.447
If it is her, I'm not leaving
her there alone any longer!

27:49.482 --> 27:50.715
Just wait.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.250
Arabela, stay with Genovese.
I'll be back soon as I can.

27:52.285 --> 27:53.785
My boss is on his way.
I'll be fine.

27:53.819 --> 27:55.687
He's dangerous.
Never forget that.

27:55.721 --> 27:56.521
Go.

28:00.393 --> 28:02.794
Dammit, the major
isn't answering either.

28:02.829 --> 28:04.663
Didn't he say
where he was going?

28:04.697 --> 28:06.064
No.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.400
He just told Tommy
to watch after Hickman,

28:08.434 --> 28:10.202
and asked us to follow up
with Anne-Marie,

28:10.236 --> 28:12.437
and then he disappeared.

28:12.471 --> 28:14.105
A scan of the area
would give us

28:14.140 --> 28:16.174
a much better idea
of what happened.

28:21.113 --> 28:22.214
Sebastian...

28:22.248 --> 28:23.882
What?

28:25.885 --> 28:28.186
I have something to tell you.

28:29.188 --> 28:30.355
What?

28:34.689 --> 28:35.615
Umm...

28:37.474 --> 28:39.942
I told my old unit in Rome

28:39.977 --> 28:42.311
to do a cyber security check.

28:43.947 --> 28:45.014
No...

28:45.048 --> 28:47.350
No, but I did it
because I really thought

28:47.384 --> 28:50.553
they needed to know
how easy it was to get into.

28:50.587 --> 28:53.238
I only got into
static databases,

28:53.358 --> 28:54.200
criminal records.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.949
I know. I told them that.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.361
They barely even have firewalls
on those things, Eva.

28:58.395 --> 29:00.296
There was nothing vital.

29:00.330 --> 29:02.846
I would never go into anything
top secret or critical,

29:02.966 --> 29:03.754
even if I could.

29:03.874 --> 29:05.067
I know, it's just...

29:05.102 --> 29:06.402
It wasn't you.

29:06.436 --> 29:07.670
I just wanted them
to be careful,

29:07.704 --> 29:08.604
and I thought,

29:08.639 --> 29:10.039
if it's so easy
for you to get into,

29:10.073 --> 29:13.342
then who else could
do the same thing?

29:15.412 --> 29:18.080
And it was
my old...

29:18.115 --> 29:19.982
country.
My...

29:20.417 --> 29:22.284
How could you do this to me?

29:22.318 --> 29:24.319
I really
didn't want to hurt you.

29:24.354 --> 29:26.255
I was only trying to...

29:26.289 --> 29:28.824
You lied to me for months!

29:34.464 --> 29:35.731
I did it because...

29:35.766 --> 29:37.633
God...

29:37.668 --> 29:39.335
everything I ever worked on.

29:39.369 --> 29:40.803
Gone.

29:40.837 --> 29:41.804
No.

29:41.838 --> 29:45.255
I can get it all back.

29:48.812 --> 29:51.947
I have some personal effects
of the victim

29:52.067 --> 29:54.498
if you want to examine them.

29:54.618 --> 30:00.489
We've taken DNA samples
and dental impressions,

30:00.524 --> 30:02.024
but without something
to compare them to,

30:02.059 --> 30:03.459
it's going to be difficult.

30:03.493 --> 30:06.062
If it's who we think it is,

30:06.696 --> 30:08.130
her mother is
a physician in France.

30:08.164 --> 30:10.532
We'll need to have her
provide samples as well.

30:10.567 --> 30:12.401
Sure.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.605
Could we have
a moment of privacy?

30:16.639 --> 30:18.440
Yes, of course.

30:22.813 --> 30:25.114
I was here...

30:25.148 --> 30:27.598
God, was it only yesterday?

30:27.718 --> 30:31.153
I was this close to her.

30:31.188 --> 30:33.489
Come on.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.934
We don't know if it's her.

30:47.604 --> 30:49.038
"Dear diary...

30:49.072 --> 30:52.423
Today, I saw
my first real bad guy."

30:52.543 --> 30:54.168
No offense,

30:54.288 --> 30:57.113
but you're a detective
from North Holland, right?

30:57.679 --> 31:00.159
Big day is having some farmer
get overly friendly

31:00.279 --> 31:02.291
with his barnyard
companions, right?

31:03.120 --> 31:07.596
Meeting me, that's gotta be
a pretty big trip for you,

31:07.716 --> 31:09.051
huh, beautiful?

31:13.927 --> 31:16.122
Ever stepped on
a piece of dog crap?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.999
Walking in the park
or something?

31:18.034 --> 31:19.334
At the time,

31:19.368 --> 31:22.571
it seems like a really big deal.

31:22.605 --> 31:24.840
"What am I going to do?

31:24.874 --> 31:28.477
I have dog crap on my shoe.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.412
How terrible."

31:30.446 --> 31:33.615
But then you wash it away,

31:33.649 --> 31:35.383
and an hour later,

31:35.418 --> 31:37.853
you've forgotten
it even happened.

31:37.887 --> 31:39.721
I feel like

31:39.756 --> 31:41.490
you're going to be that for me.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.758
You seem like
a really big deal now,

31:43.793 --> 31:47.629
but when you're convicted
and back in America,

31:47.663 --> 31:50.532
you'll be the piece of dog crap

31:50.566 --> 31:53.535
I once washed off
the bottom of my shoe.

31:54.362 --> 31:56.017
Commander.

31:56.137 --> 31:58.040
Inspector Seeger.

31:58.074 --> 32:00.542
Just finishing off my notes
for the arrest report.

32:00.576 --> 32:02.811
So, everything's
all right in here, huh?

32:02.845 --> 32:05.680
Perfect.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.015
Absolutely perfect.

32:08.785 --> 32:11.019
[Music pounding]

32:19.205 --> 32:20.985
This way. Upstairs.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.392
[Sighs heavily]

32:22.512 --> 32:24.833
If you come back down...

32:24.867 --> 32:27.302
"If" I come back down?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.004
Maybe I could dance myself
again for you.

32:29.038 --> 32:31.606
Well, in that case,

32:31.641 --> 32:33.575
I will be sure
to make it back down.

32:50.993 --> 32:55.063
It was my ex-partner.

32:55.097 --> 32:57.699
He is responsible for
taking your information

32:57.733 --> 32:59.101
and putting a virus
in your machines.

33:01.137 --> 33:02.637
But you can get the files back?

33:02.672 --> 33:05.073
He says it's up to you.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.743
Either you lose your files,
or he makes them public.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.144
Public?

33:12.415 --> 33:13.775
God...

33:13.895 --> 33:15.965
You can have it all back again.

33:19.011 --> 33:20.435
What do you want to do?

33:29.866 --> 33:31.028
Call him.

33:31.148 --> 33:32.501
If it helps find Anne-Marie,

33:32.535 --> 33:35.871
tell him I don't give a damn
what he does with the files.

33:35.905 --> 33:37.072
Are you sure?

33:53.246 --> 33:55.205
Michel Lechnya Dorn.

33:55.578 --> 33:56.758
Sit with me.

33:56.878 --> 33:59.895
Not if I am surrounded.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.623
You're worried about a pistol?

34:03.743 --> 34:06.735
I could have had
this entire place incinerated

34:06.769 --> 34:08.437
the moment I knew you were here.

34:08.471 --> 34:12.393
The difference between us
is you didn't.

34:12.514 --> 34:14.810
The only reason I didn't

34:14.844 --> 34:17.824
is because you and I have
something to deal with first.

34:18.873 --> 34:20.406
Even so,

34:20.783 --> 34:24.753
there are a great many
other differences between us.

34:25.603 --> 34:26.992
[Snaps fingers]

34:35.697 --> 34:38.734
This thing with Louis Daniel
has gone far enough.

34:38.768 --> 34:42.103
Louis Daniel is a fly.

34:42.138 --> 34:43.572
Less.

34:43.606 --> 34:45.574
But you bombed
his vacation home.

34:45.608 --> 34:47.042
You tried to kill him,
did kill his child.

34:47.076 --> 34:48.476
Did I?

34:48.511 --> 34:50.445
Are you saying that
you did not plant that bomb?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.679
Please.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.116
Of course we did.

34:54.150 --> 34:57.786
What is interesting
is your assessment of targets.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.621
I mean,

34:59.655 --> 35:02.824
he wasn't even home
at the time, was he?

35:06.796 --> 35:08.463
But why her?

35:08.498 --> 35:12.968
Because you and that bitch
put my brother-in-law in prison.

35:17.266 --> 35:19.730
Rebecca was the target all along.

35:19.850 --> 35:21.031
It was an end.

35:21.151 --> 35:22.452
Who is your brother-in-law?

35:22.486 --> 35:23.753
Anatoly Bardov.

35:23.787 --> 35:24.754
Bardov?

35:24.788 --> 35:26.489
Yes. I was married
to his sister.

35:26.523 --> 35:28.758
He is a war criminal.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.793
A rapist, a murderer,

35:30.828 --> 35:33.329
a soulless monster.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.598
Why is one side
deemed criminal...

35:35.632 --> 35:36.766
Monsters as you say...

35:36.800 --> 35:40.136
And the other side's crimes
swept away?

35:40.170 --> 35:41.671
Your nation attacked
the Chechen people

35:41.705 --> 35:43.373
without provocation.

35:43.407 --> 35:44.474
We were soldiers.

35:44.508 --> 35:47.210
Our leaders sent us to fight,
we fought.

35:47.244 --> 35:51.814
"Just following orders"
is not good enough anymore.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.484
Bardov raped and butchered

35:54.518 --> 35:56.352
a group of 15-year-old

35:56.387 --> 35:58.354
and 16-year-old girls.

35:58.389 --> 36:01.224
No one ever raped them.

36:01.258 --> 36:02.492
That was a lie.

36:02.526 --> 36:05.762
And you called them "girls"?

36:05.796 --> 36:07.530
They were snipers.

36:07.564 --> 36:09.365
They killed dozens of our men.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.568
We found them with their rifles,
their scopes.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.170
There was a trial...

36:14.204 --> 36:15.405
They murdered

36:15.439 --> 36:18.474
my wife and children.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.509
Where is the justice for that?

36:20.911 --> 36:24.347
What Chechen dog
stood trial for that?

36:24.381 --> 36:28.184
Do you know the Budyonnovsk
Hospital hostage crisis?

36:28.218 --> 36:28.939
Yes.

36:29.059 --> 36:31.521
1500 hostages,

36:31.555 --> 36:32.755
all civilians,

36:32.790 --> 36:35.625
123 were murdered.

36:35.659 --> 36:37.794
The dead included my Kristina,

36:37.828 --> 36:39.195
Bardov's sister,

36:39.229 --> 36:40.830
and both of my girls.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.399
They were 8 and 7,

36:43.434 --> 36:45.601
and they weren't soldiers.

36:45.636 --> 36:47.870
So you'll forgive me
for not weeping

36:47.905 --> 36:50.447
for your teenage
chechen snipers.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.476
What do you want?

36:53.510 --> 36:55.411
A deal.

36:55.446 --> 36:58.385
If you ever want to see
the Daniels alive again,

36:58.505 --> 37:01.551
I want my brother-in-law
brought here.

37:03.020 --> 37:03.820
What?

37:03.854 --> 37:05.888
I want to take him home.

37:05.923 --> 37:08.424
How am I supposed to do that?

37:08.459 --> 37:10.360
You have signed him out
for questioning

37:10.394 --> 37:12.228
11 times

37:12.262 --> 37:13.329
since he was imprisoned.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.631
They let you take him

37:15.666 --> 37:16.866
every time.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.401
Alone.

37:18.435 --> 37:19.535
[Chuckles]

37:19.570 --> 37:22.605
You are a legend, Dorn.

37:22.639 --> 37:24.941
So, sign him out again,

37:24.975 --> 37:26.743
only, this time, bring him here.

37:28.098 --> 37:29.912
You have 24 hours.

37:34.729 --> 37:36.336
All right, I'm going to
go to the office

37:36.456 --> 37:37.884
and look through
Anne-Marie's things.

37:38.004 --> 37:39.095
For?

37:39.215 --> 37:40.947
An address, a phone number.

37:41.067 --> 37:42.291
We need to call her mother.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.894
And if you can't find any
contact info in her desk?

37:44.928 --> 37:46.596
Oh, God, there's got to be
something

37:46.630 --> 37:47.897
around there somewhere.

37:47.931 --> 37:49.448
I'll go through Louis' files.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.034
Right.

37:51.527 --> 37:52.778
What do you need me to do?

37:52.898 --> 37:54.470
Go to the hospital.

37:54.505 --> 37:56.305
Check on Genovese.

38:02.079 --> 38:05.014
Come on. Come on...

38:05.049 --> 38:06.582
[Computer beeping]

38:06.617 --> 38:08.017
- Yes.
- It's working.

38:08.052 --> 38:11.320
[Scanner beeping]

38:11.355 --> 38:12.889
Eva, look.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.291
I told you.
Someone walked away.

38:15.325 --> 38:17.393
Someone with smaller feet,

38:17.428 --> 38:19.495
and not in boots.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.064
She could be
out there somewhere?

38:21.098 --> 38:22.899
The accident happened

38:22.933 --> 38:23.700
two days ago.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.702
And it's getting dark,

38:25.736 --> 38:26.736
and it's really
starting to snow now.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.971
Okay, come on,
we'd better hurry up.

38:48.187 --> 38:49.926
Where's the guard?

38:57.067 --> 38:59.869
Arabela?

38:59.903 --> 39:01.504
Arabela!

39:01.538 --> 39:02.505
Arabela...

[Groans groggily]

39:03.641 --> 39:04.741
What happened?

39:06.910 --> 39:08.011
It was my boss.

39:09.046 --> 39:10.013
He attacked me.

39:10.047 --> 39:12.482
He helped him.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.685
I'm sorry, Tommy.

39:15.719 --> 39:17.553
Genovese's gone.

[Cell phone rings]

39:42.780 --> 39:44.080
I quit yesterday!

39:44.114 --> 39:45.381
Louis is in trouble.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.016
What kind of trouble?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.518
<i>There is every possibility</i>

39:48.552 --> 39:51.020

by tomorrow afternoon.

I'll call the team.

Despots, tyrants,

mass murderers

Men who have not dozens,

but thousands of victims
on their ledger sheets.
