WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:01.650
We're done.

00:01.950 --> 00:03.650
What?

00:03.851 --> 00:05.151
I'm letting you go.

00:05.186 --> 00:07.570
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>
David Rosen!

00:07.605 --> 00:10.323
Why is Quinn Perkins'
dead ex-boyfriend,

00:10.357 --> 00:12.725
calling one of the grant
administration's biggest donors

00:12.743 --> 00:14.778
11 times the week
he's blown to bits?

00:14.829 --> 00:16.395
Wake up and smell
the cover-up, Abby.

00:16.413 --> 00:19.449
This is a conspiracy.
Who knows how high up it goes?

00:19.500 --> 00:22.168
I hear we have
a David Rosen issue.

00:22.203 --> 00:24.037
That we do, Livvie.
That we do.

00:25.306 --> 00:26.806
I can't be here.
I shouldn't be here.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.841
I am out of the White House.
The press could see me.

00:28.859 --> 00:30.676
I am risking everything.
<i>Everything.</i>

00:30.694 --> 00:32.612
We are all risking everything.

00:32.646 --> 00:34.147
Would you rather we met
inside the White House?

00:34.181 --> 00:36.832
Does that feel less
like a felony to you?

00:36.900 --> 00:37.717
(Lowered voice) Secret service
is outside that door.

00:37.751 --> 00:40.102
Please do not shout the word
"felony" in this room.

00:40.337 --> 00:42.755
We wouldn't even be in this room
if it weren't for Hollis.

00:42.789 --> 00:44.940
Now, now, just a minute.

00:44.975 --> 00:46.959
We all jumped off the bridge
together. Heck, we held hands.

00:46.977 --> 00:50.162
She means after the bridge
and the hand-holding,

00:50.180 --> 00:51.530
when you went rogue.

00:51.565 --> 00:52.998
You freelanced, Hollis.

00:53.416 --> 00:55.850
You're damn right I freelanced.
There's a big old mess,

00:55.885 --> 00:58.253
and hell if anyone else is
gonna clean it up.

00:58.304 --> 01:00.288
Now we can sit here all night
twisting my nipples,

01:00.323 --> 01:02.057
over something I did
to protect you ingrates,

01:02.091 --> 01:03.475
or we can address the fact
that if David Rosen

01:03.509 --> 01:06.728
finds the connection between
Cytron and Doyle Energy,

01:06.762 --> 01:08.563
every one of us here
is about three goose eggs shy

01:08.597 --> 01:10.715
of spending the rest
of their lives in prison.

01:10.749 --> 01:11.816
Am I making myself clear?

01:11.850 --> 01:13.635
We still have
a David Rosen problem!

01:13.669 --> 01:15.754
(Mellie) So what do we do?
(Verna) What <i>can</i> we do?

01:16.488 --> 01:17.705
Happy to freelance
one more time.

01:17.756 --> 01:20.975
Do not say that in my presence
<i>ever</i> again.

01:21.009 --> 01:22.760
Oh, someone's gotten ruffles
on her panties

01:22.778 --> 01:24.829
since she entered
the White House.

01:24.863 --> 01:26.781
(Verna) Hollis, show some
respect. She's the first lady.

01:26.815 --> 01:28.799
(Hollis) - Who knows that better than me?
- I'll fix it.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.501
What?

01:30.535 --> 01:32.837
What's that, Livvie?

01:32.871 --> 01:35.773
Our David Rosen problem...
I'll fix it.

01:35.807 --> 01:39.209
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

01:43.280 --> 01:45.866
Good to see you.
How have you been?

01:45.900 --> 01:48.151
You're not speaking to me.

01:48.786 --> 01:50.820
I find when I've been
called in by my boss,

01:50.854 --> 01:52.388
for the sole purpose
of being fired...

01:52.423 --> 01:54.357
which is, by the way, rude...
it's rude to make someone

01:54.391 --> 01:56.509
come to the office
so you can fire him.

01:56.543 --> 01:57.994
- F.Y.I...
- David...

01:58.028 --> 02:00.280
I find that when I am dragged
into work to be fired,

02:00.331 --> 02:01.964
it's best to adhere
to the "if you can't say

02:01.982 --> 02:04.450
something nice, don't say
anything at all" rule

02:04.484 --> 02:05.801
I learned from my mother.

02:05.836 --> 02:07.654
- David... - Do I have to clear out
my desk, or do you have my stuff

02:07.705 --> 02:11.323
- in a nice sturdy box already?
- David, you're about to feel very bad

02:11.357 --> 02:13.675
because I'm <i>not</i> firing you.

02:13.710 --> 02:14.760
Right. Wait.

02:14.794 --> 02:15.761
You're not?

02:15.796 --> 02:17.763
No, I went out on a limb.
Pulled a few strings,

02:17.798 --> 02:19.915
told the powers that be
that David Rosen is

02:19.933 --> 02:22.001
a brilliant A.U.S.A.,

02:22.135 --> 02:24.436
my best A.U.S.A.,
and that I need him,

02:24.470 --> 02:25.837
and that he's ready
to come off of suspension

02:25.888 --> 02:27.221
and make a new start,

02:27.239 --> 02:30.492
that he's done obsessing
about the past or Olivia Pope.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.327
Am I wrong to say that?

02:33.762 --> 02:35.080
(Indistinct conversations)

02:35.114 --> 02:37.048
This is a good group.

02:37.099 --> 02:38.300
(Sugar packet rips) Yeah.

02:38.334 --> 02:39.417
I go to a lot of groups...

02:39.452 --> 02:42.053
A.A., N.A., D.A.

02:42.088 --> 02:45.589
G.A. Hey, I guess if
there was a self-help A.,

02:45.590 --> 02:46.524
I'd go to that one, too.

02:46.558 --> 02:47.492
(Chuckles)

02:48.026 --> 02:49.393
This one's the best, though,

02:49.428 --> 02:51.796
'cause I really like
the people in it.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.965
And I'd really like to spend
more time with some of them,

02:53.999 --> 02:57.101
you know, outside the meetings,

02:57.152 --> 03:00.371
'cause I like the people
in this group... some of them...

03:00.405 --> 03:01.689
A lot.

03:04.126 --> 03:05.543
Uh...

03:05.577 --> 03:06.844
Becky, do you wanna...

03:06.895 --> 03:08.546
go out with you sometime?

03:08.580 --> 03:10.648
Yes.

03:10.682 --> 03:13.918
This is my number.

03:13.952 --> 03:16.204
I'm free tomorrow night.

03:24.211 --> 03:26.896
Edison, what did I just say?
Tomorrow night's no good.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.499
Because I do not want
to go out with you.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.769
No, I don't.
I don't.

03:32.803 --> 03:34.554
Okay, fine.
Call me later.

03:34.588 --> 03:37.156
(Beep)

03:37.190 --> 03:39.008
- What's she doing?
- He's gonna call back.

03:39.059 --> 03:41.878
- How do you know? - Because Edison
Davis has serious game.

03:41.912 --> 03:43.662
(Cell phone alert chimes)

03:43.680 --> 03:46.215
Yes, it is later. Cute.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.402
No. Tonight's no good either
because I'm working.

03:49.436 --> 03:51.788
And I do not want to go out
with you. Good-bye.

03:51.822 --> 03:53.422
Good-bye.

03:53.457 --> 03:54.440
(Scoffs) (Beep)

03:59.395 --> 04:02.764
Okay. No matter what we see
when we walk in that room,

04:02.799 --> 04:03.765
no one makes a face,
no one cracks a smile,

04:03.800 --> 04:05.350
no one says a witty joke.

04:05.368 --> 04:07.436
- She's talking about you.
- Shut up.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.004
(Huck) Okay, see,
the muddy footprints?

04:10.038 --> 04:12.440
Husband came in right here, stopped.

04:12.474 --> 04:15.376
This guy here? Our friendly
neighborhood rapist.

04:15.411 --> 04:16.711
Husband sees the guy
on top of his wife.

04:16.745 --> 04:17.978
They were on the floor?

04:18.012 --> 04:19.714
On the counter. You can tell
by the blood splatter.

04:19.748 --> 04:22.300
(Huck) Two beautiful shots fired
through the pericardium,

04:22.334 --> 04:23.734
right to the heart.

04:23.752 --> 04:26.104
One, two. Dead in seconds.
Now what? We call the police?

04:26.138 --> 04:27.471
Not unless we want
a thousand news vans

04:27.489 --> 04:29.357
out on the front lawn
within minutes.

04:29.408 --> 04:31.626
Liv, how do you want
to play this?

04:33.000 --> 04:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.339 --> 04:46.391
Are you ready to tell me
what happened, governor?

04:46.525 --> 04:47.075

04:47.110 --> 04:50.878
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

04:51.713 --> 04:53.248
And as soon as I walked in,
I saw...

04:53.283 --> 04:58.170
I saw... he was on top of her.

05:00.004 --> 05:01.755
Joan saw me and started
shouting for help,

05:01.806 --> 05:03.257
saying "stop. Please stop."

05:03.308 --> 05:06.009
I just... I-I grabbed my gun
and I shot him...

05:06.043 --> 05:08.679
I shot the man raping my wife.

05:08.713 --> 05:10.314
He was our contractor.

05:10.348 --> 05:13.684
He'd been our contractor
for over two years.

05:13.718 --> 05:15.285
He built this house
from scratch.

05:15.603 --> 05:17.120
You hire someone,
you let them into your home,

05:17.138 --> 05:19.056
you think they can be trusted.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.424
You never expect them to...

05:20.458 --> 05:21.892
Your damn <i>contractor.</i>

05:21.926 --> 05:23.060
Where'd you get the gun?

05:23.094 --> 05:24.461
(Projector and camera shutter
click)

05:24.479 --> 05:26.180
Back cupboard. I keep hunting
rifles, a few pistols.

05:26.231 --> 05:28.282
I'm sure you remember
from the election.

05:28.349 --> 05:30.234
The gun-friendly democrat.

05:33.304 --> 05:35.572
Abby, will you take
Mrs. Reston upstairs?

05:35.607 --> 05:38.659
She could use some rest.

05:38.693 --> 05:40.694
(Sniffles)

05:44.081 --> 05:45.115
Her hair is wet.

05:45.150 --> 05:46.250
She showered.

05:46.268 --> 05:47.852
So?

05:47.886 --> 05:49.203
So a shower makes a rape exam
negligible.

05:49.237 --> 05:50.420
It means we have nothing.

05:50.438 --> 05:51.772
I thought I made myself clear
on the phone.

05:51.807 --> 05:53.307
My wife was raped an hour ago,
Ms. Pope.

05:53.358 --> 05:55.442
I'm supposed to tell her
she can't shower the guy off?

05:55.477 --> 05:56.861
Not to mention,
your bourbon's out.

05:56.895 --> 05:58.479
One wet glass.
You've been drinking.

05:58.530 --> 06:01.615
Hey, again, my wife was raped.
I shot her rapist.

06:01.650 --> 06:03.367
I-I think that warrants
a drink.

06:03.401 --> 06:06.871
Governor, I know this is
a terrible time for you,

06:06.905 --> 06:08.806
and I understand
how you feel about me,

06:08.840 --> 06:10.457
but if we're going
to work together,

06:10.492 --> 06:12.793
if I'm going to help you here,
you follow my rules.

06:12.828 --> 06:14.628
It's up to you.
You know what's at stake.

06:14.663 --> 06:16.747
You've seen what I can do.

06:16.781 --> 06:20.251
You're the best.

06:20.285 --> 06:21.886
Don't I know it.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.027
Get Jane Powell on the phone...
Home or cell only.

06:31.045 --> 06:33.213
She's the new A.U.S.A.,
David Rosen's replacement.

06:33.248 --> 06:34.414
Never been to the playground
with her before.

06:34.465 --> 06:35.832
Let's see how well she shares.

06:35.866 --> 06:37.701
Huck, make sure there's no trace
of us in that kitchen.

06:37.719 --> 06:40.036
We've only been here minutes.

06:40.054 --> 06:41.305
What did she mean,

06:41.339 --> 06:42.556
"you've seen what I can do?"

06:42.590 --> 06:44.391
The governor was 10 points ahead
of president Fitzgerald

06:44.425 --> 06:46.059
six weeks
before the national election.

06:46.094 --> 06:46.861
Yeah, I remember.

06:46.895 --> 06:48.346
Who do you think took
all those points away?

06:49.915 --> 06:52.183
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

06:52.218 --> 06:53.451
(Indistinct conversations)

06:53.486 --> 06:55.420
(Clicking)

06:56.839 --> 06:58.089
(Clicking)

07:00.076 --> 07:02.410
(Clicking)

07:04.245 --> 07:05.762
Is Mrs. Reston asleep?

07:05.796 --> 07:07.164
She's lying down.
She took a sedative.

07:07.198 --> 07:09.349
- Quinn, you didn't leave her with...
- I gave her one. Took the rest with me.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.302
- Good job. - Ms. Pope, Jane Powell,
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

07:12.336 --> 07:14.638
I understand you're working
with the governor and his wife.

07:14.672 --> 07:16.172
I need to question them.
Mrs. Reston is sleeping,

07:16.190 --> 07:17.841
and the governor's
still in shock.

07:17.859 --> 07:20.310
So sad. I understand.
How about later today?

07:20.344 --> 07:21.344
How about my office, noon?

07:21.362 --> 07:22.529
Make it 1:00.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.848
They should try to get
as much rest as possible.

07:24.866 --> 07:28.985
It's the governor of Maryland.
I've been told to be discreet.

07:29.919 --> 07:31.087
That was easy.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.389
(Front door opens and closes)
You'd be surprised

07:32.423 --> 07:35.058
what powerful people can get
away with behind closed doors.

07:35.892 --> 07:38.127
(Olivia) We need to craft a statement.
(Woman) Why is she here?

07:38.161 --> 07:40.696
- We need her, Alison.
- Actually, we <i>don't</i> need her,

07:40.731 --> 07:43.015
and after all the dirty tricks
she pulled during the election,

07:43.066 --> 07:45.251
- we sure as hell can't trust her.
- I'm happy to go home.

07:45.302 --> 07:47.703
Now hold on. Alison, you're
a spokesperson, not a fixer.

07:47.738 --> 07:50.056
We need a fixer.
Olivia, you were saying?

07:50.090 --> 07:52.208
Paper statement... brief, basic.

07:52.242 --> 07:54.260
"We're grateful to the people
of Maryland for their support

07:54.311 --> 07:56.429
"and ask them to respect
our privacy

07:56.463 --> 07:57.746
as we handle
this family tragedy."

07:57.764 --> 07:59.982
- This tragedy is an opportunity.
- Alison...

08:00.000 --> 08:01.634
What the governor did
was heroic. We need to set

08:01.668 --> 08:03.519
- that narrative... - "We're grateful
to the people of Maryland

08:03.553 --> 08:05.071
"for their support and ask them
to respect our privacy

08:05.122 --> 08:06.756
as we handle
this family tragedy."

08:06.790 --> 08:08.691
Basic, boilerplate,

08:08.725 --> 08:10.893
nothing fancy, no narrative.

08:10.927 --> 08:12.261
You do <i>not</i> need
to get ahead of this.

08:12.295 --> 08:14.213
We see how this plays out
over the next 24 hours,

08:14.264 --> 08:17.182
and then we set our agenda.
Agreed?

08:17.217 --> 08:18.267
♪

08:18.301 --> 08:20.135
You're the fixer.

08:20.169 --> 08:21.336
Yes, I am.

08:21.754 --> 08:23.171
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

08:23.206 --> 08:25.073
At which time, governor,
you heard Mrs. Reston

08:25.091 --> 08:27.575
cry for help, grabbed the gun
from the cupboard, and shot him.

08:27.593 --> 08:29.244
Yes. Twice.

08:29.262 --> 08:30.578
Mrs. Reston,

08:30.596 --> 08:32.297
the contractor entered
through the living room

08:32.347 --> 08:34.633
and pinned you to the counter.
Is that correct?

08:35.918 --> 08:38.270
That's...
(Voice breaks) That's correct.

08:38.304 --> 08:40.889
(Crying)

08:40.923 --> 08:42.224
Well, I think I have
everything I need.

08:42.258 --> 08:44.359
I am so sorry for the trouble.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.062
I know this must be difficult
on top of everything else.

08:47.096 --> 08:49.781
I'll be in touch if you have
any other questions.

08:49.815 --> 08:50.982
(Olivia) What else do we know?

08:51.033 --> 08:52.817
Phone calls... lots of them,
long ones between.

08:52.869 --> 08:54.936
- The governor and the contractor.
- They got pretty heated,

08:54.954 --> 08:55.937
according to
the contractor's secretary.

08:55.955 --> 08:58.606
Red flag. The gun...
He bought it a week ago.

08:58.624 --> 09:00.375
Are you sure? Because in his
statement, it says he's had it

09:00.409 --> 09:01.776
- for 15 years.
- It's rare.

09:01.794 --> 09:04.129
Mateba model 6,
customized wood handle.

09:04.163 --> 09:06.131
I traced the workmanship to
a private dealer in Blacksburg.

09:06.165 --> 09:08.449
Shipped last week,
arrived two days ago.

09:08.467 --> 09:09.918
Ouch.
That's awful convenient.

09:09.952 --> 09:10.586
(Harrison) He was drunk.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.588
The governor didn't go home
after he left his office.

09:12.622 --> 09:14.157
He stopped by a local
bar called the barrel.

09:14.158 --> 09:15.390
(Huck) Red flag number two.

09:15.491 --> 09:18.259
Maybe he forgot he stopped.
After the trauma, he could've...

09:18.294 --> 09:21.296
Maybe he needed liquid courage.
Okay, this is getting messy,

09:21.330 --> 09:23.098
<i>...support from</i>
<i>the people of Maryland.</i>

09:23.132 --> 09:24.316
<i>The governor is also grateful</i>

09:24.351 --> 09:27.502
<i>for the freedom granted</i>
<i>by the constitution</i>

09:27.520 --> 09:28.954
<i>in the right to bear arms,</i>

09:29.039 --> 09:32.741
<i>the right to protect his family</i>
<i>and stop a rapist</i>

09:32.776 --> 09:35.444
<i>before he could commit</i>
<i>further violence to his wife.</i>

09:35.978 --> 09:38.346
<i>If that is not heroism,</i>

09:38.364 --> 09:39.748
<i>I don't know what is.</i>

09:39.766 --> 09:40.585
Did she just...

09:40.585 --> 09:42.518
Do the exact opposite of
what I told her to do? Yes.

09:43.019 --> 09:44.070
She did.

09:48.716 --> 09:50.099
So she put me on a pedestal.

09:50.117 --> 09:51.368
Big whoop.
That's what I pay her for.

09:51.402 --> 09:53.637
And when the press finds out
about the angry phone calls

09:53.671 --> 09:55.672
to the victim?
When they find out you were

09:55.690 --> 09:57.407
three sheets to the wind
before he was killed?

09:57.441 --> 09:58.508
Now hold on a second...

09:58.543 --> 09:59.526
That the gun you shot him with

09:59.561 --> 10:01.094
was purchased
<i>less</i> than a week ago?

10:01.229 --> 10:03.000
From a collector I've been
chasing for years.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.764
I can show you
the e-mail chain.

10:04.799 --> 10:06.266
So the multiple
angry phone calls...

10:06.300 --> 10:09.785
Was me telling a crappy
contractor to stop gouging.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.589
He took two months
to install bathroom tiles.

10:12.623 --> 10:14.623
Now if you think that's
a motive for murder...

10:14.658 --> 10:16.276
I think it's enough
to give people pause.

10:16.327 --> 10:18.511
Pedestals fall down, governor,
and I don't want

10:18.562 --> 10:20.713
to see you
hanging there like a piñata.

10:21.548 --> 10:23.632
(Chuckles)

10:23.666 --> 10:25.184
Something you'd like to say?

10:25.268 --> 10:26.619
Yeah, it's just ironic,
that's all...

10:26.653 --> 10:29.471
You lecturing me on political
opportunism. (Scoffs)

10:29.505 --> 10:32.942
You want to know the real reason
I own so many guns?

10:32.976 --> 10:34.793
- Governor...
- Governor nothing!

10:35.728 --> 10:38.630
You ran an attack ad
saying I was soft on crime,

10:38.664 --> 10:41.182
when you knew damn well
it wasn't true.

10:41.217 --> 10:43.317
You framed the narrative.
Guess what. It stuck.

10:43.335 --> 10:45.403
Cost me the South,
and if I had to point fingers,

10:45.437 --> 10:47.472
I'd say it probably cost me
the election.

10:47.506 --> 10:49.073
Do you want to survive this,
governor?

10:49.108 --> 10:51.292
Do you want your career
to survive?

10:51.327 --> 10:52.327
Of course I do.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.761
Then let me do my job.

10:54.396 --> 10:55.630
I need the president
on the phone

10:55.664 --> 10:57.065
as soon as he can step away,
before noon,

10:57.099 --> 10:58.199
have the team in my office,

10:58.234 --> 11:00.034
ready to brief on east Sudan
when he calls.

11:00.068 --> 11:02.186
- The president's in Japan.
- At the G8 conference, yeah.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.587
No, I mean, he's <i>in</i> Japan.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.855
Yeah, I know.
He's at the g8 conference.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.590
Funny story... I'm the White House
chief of staff...

11:06.624 --> 11:09.359
No, I'm saying, that
it's 13 hours ahead in Japan.

11:09.394 --> 11:11.395
So people tend to tell me things
relating to the president.

11:11.429 --> 11:14.080
I'm saying that he's sleeping
for the next seven hours,

11:14.098 --> 11:15.967
because it's after midnight
in Japan.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.135
- He's in Japan.
- He's in Japan.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.353
You could've said that sooner.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.123
You don't listen.
You just talk over me.

11:22.157 --> 11:23.359
- I never get to finish my...

11:23.360 --> 11:25.092
Mary, why is my husband James
in the press secretary's office?

11:25.093 --> 11:26.610
He's a journalist.

11:26.661 --> 11:28.312
Yes, but why is he here?

11:28.346 --> 11:29.914
He's a journalist.

11:29.948 --> 11:32.783
I'm saying, he is a journalist.

11:32.818 --> 11:36.720
(Indistinct conversations)

11:36.771 --> 11:39.106
Hi, honey. What are you doing in
the press secretary's office?

11:39.141 --> 11:40.825
I'm a journalist.
(Chuckles)

11:42.860 --> 11:44.277
What is happening?

11:44.311 --> 11:46.696
I called my old boss,
and he gave me my job back,

11:46.730 --> 11:49.499
because he cares about me
and my happiness.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.304
I told you why
we can't adopt a baby.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.939
And I heard you,
which is why I'm back at work.

11:55.973 --> 11:57.807
We discussed
when we got married.

11:57.858 --> 11:59.075
Why you continuing to work
at the White House

11:59.109 --> 12:00.493
would be problematic.

12:00.528 --> 12:03.612
And me without a baby is very
problematic, but funny story...

12:03.697 --> 12:04.448
Don't "funny story" me.

12:04.482 --> 12:07.082
Funny story...I am now the chief
White House correspondent

12:07.083 --> 12:08.617
for the most powerful news
outlet in the nation,

12:08.651 --> 12:09.702
and I'm childless,

12:09.736 --> 12:11.937
so I got plenty of time
to give it my all.

12:11.971 --> 12:13.839
(Door opens)

12:13.874 --> 12:15.191
(Door closes)

12:15.225 --> 12:17.343
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

12:19.628 --> 12:21.079
Mmm.

12:21.113 --> 12:23.131
- Hey, guess what?
- Hmm?

12:23.165 --> 12:24.749
They offered me my job back.

12:24.783 --> 12:26.434
That's great. (Moans)

12:26.685 --> 12:28.052
I don't know
if I'm gonna take it.

12:28.087 --> 12:29.621
Wait. What? Why?

12:29.655 --> 12:31.089
The ex-Cytron guy
I've been calling for weeks,

12:31.123 --> 12:32.607
finally got back to me,

12:32.658 --> 12:34.175
and we're meeting
at the Griddle Cafe,

12:34.209 --> 12:35.426
3:30 this afternoon.

12:35.860 --> 12:37.111
Uh...

12:37.145 --> 12:38.729
What?
Be happy for me.

12:38.747 --> 12:40.964
This guy could tie Hollis Doyle
to the explosion.

12:40.999 --> 12:43.434
He could be my missing link,
my second shooter,

12:43.468 --> 12:44.835
my smoking gun.

12:44.869 --> 12:46.153
Okay, but then what?

12:46.187 --> 12:47.955
You throw your incredibly
promising legal career,

12:48.006 --> 12:49.957
that you've worked
your entire adult life on away,

12:49.991 --> 12:52.426
to become a professional
conspiracy theorist?

12:52.477 --> 12:53.660
Hold conventions in the desert?

12:53.695 --> 12:54.828
Sell "who is Quinn Perkins"
t-shirts

12:54.863 --> 12:56.230
for the rest of your life?

12:56.281 --> 12:58.115
Why do you care what I do
with the rest of my life?

12:58.149 --> 12:59.433
(Cell phone rings) I don't.

12:59.484 --> 13:00.501
I'm just saying.

13:00.535 --> 13:02.302
(Speaks indistinctly)

13:02.337 --> 13:05.355
(Ring)

13:05.390 --> 13:06.690
(Ring)

13:06.724 --> 13:08.575
(Clears throat)
Stopped for coffee.

13:08.610 --> 13:11.195
Yeah, on my way.

13:13.347 --> 13:14.347
See ya.

13:15.732 --> 13:16.699
The governor's people
jumped the gun

13:16.717 --> 13:17.750
with their press conference,

13:17.801 --> 13:19.168
but the media's seeing him
as a hero,

13:19.202 --> 13:20.720
so we need to keep that alive.

13:20.754 --> 13:22.622
The man shot a rapist. What else
could he be but a hero?

13:22.656 --> 13:23.856
Or an angry drunk wanted

13:23.891 --> 13:25.841
to try a shiny new pistol
on a human target.

13:25.859 --> 13:27.377
There's many ways to tell a story.

13:27.378 --> 13:28.710
(Olivia) We need to
tell the story our way.

13:28.711 --> 13:30.329
We've got a hero, we've got
a victim, now we just need

13:30.364 --> 13:31.964
to finish the job...
give the press their villain.

13:32.014 --> 13:32.714
The contractor.

13:33.015 --> 13:35.901
We're digging up good,
old-fashioned dirt, everyone...

13:35.935 --> 13:37.586
The more, the better.

13:37.621 --> 13:39.371
Quinn, check out
Bill Meyer's police records.

13:39.406 --> 13:41.307
We're looking
for any history of violence.

13:41.341 --> 13:44.009
Harrison, Abby,
talk to the contractor's crew.

13:44.244 --> 13:46.578
Maybe they hated their boss.
Let's move quickly, people.

13:46.612 --> 13:48.362
We want to lock this down,

13:48.381 --> 13:49.964
give the media
a nice, clean narrative,

13:49.998 --> 13:51.966
- then let them do the work for us.
- We're on it.

13:51.984 --> 13:53.068
What?

13:53.102 --> 13:54.452
Nothing.
Go, team.

13:54.487 --> 13:55.787
You want inside or outside?

13:55.821 --> 13:56.788
Inside.

13:56.822 --> 13:58.923
Sure. Makes sense.
More privacy

13:58.958 --> 14:00.741
for when you need to sneak away
to talk to your new boyfriend.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.094
I don't have a...
I don't know what you're...

14:02.095 --> 14:02.644
You're getting laid.

14:02.645 --> 14:03.995
- Harrison!
- Hey.

14:04.029 --> 14:06.398
It's a good thing.

14:06.432 --> 14:10.284
So it says here you arrested
Mr. Meyer for shoplifting twice?

14:10.302 --> 14:12.420
That's good.
Oh, I-I mean, it's bad.

14:12.455 --> 14:13.955
It means you and I are punished
because we have to pay

14:13.989 --> 14:16.190
a higher price
for our goods and services.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.159
Was he a violent shoplifter?

14:18.193 --> 14:21.096
You gonna do a stacked stone
with rustic wall cap?

14:21.130 --> 14:23.448
I was gonna lay the bed
with saginaw river rock first,

14:23.482 --> 14:25.016
then add some keystone
and arch stone? (Whistles)

14:25.550 --> 14:27.685
- You get all that off the Internet?
- Every single word.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.320
So did he have a lot
of arguments with people?

14:29.371 --> 14:30.655
What kind of question is that?

14:30.689 --> 14:32.256
Do you have a lot of arguments
with people?

14:32.307 --> 14:33.624
I'm about to.

14:33.659 --> 14:35.893
Look, my boss died here,
I just lost my job.

14:35.928 --> 14:40.381
Make yourself useful, red,
and give me those. Thanks.

14:40.415 --> 14:43.717

15:10.910 --> 15:12.427
like, erasers and lightbulbs
and stuff.

15:12.462 --> 15:14.346
He was a serial shoplifter.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.164
Okay, I know it's not much,
but I'm still digging.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.566
Got some dirt to add
to the pile?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.518
No dirt, just hair.
Unless Mr. Long Hair

15:19.552 --> 15:21.370
was raping her
all over the house,

15:21.404 --> 15:22.654
they were screwing, Liv,

15:22.688 --> 15:24.005
in the shower, the hot tub,
the laundry room.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.974
They even used the bed
once in a while.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.926
It's a major renovation, Abby.
It's his job to be everywhere.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.478
(Scoffs) You ask
Lonnie the stonemason,

15:29.529 --> 15:31.613
his boss had a long history of
going the extra mile in his jobs

15:31.647 --> 15:33.532
to make the wives happy.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.369
He was screwing them
left and right.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.708
You were having an affair.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.044
What? Your husband burst in
on you and you panicked,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.779
and you cried rape,

15:47.797 --> 15:50.832
and then you watched as he
shot and killed Bill Meyer.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.917
You were having an affair, Joan,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.118
and that's how you tried to hide it.

15:53.136 --> 15:55.253
You tell me that isn't true.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.305
Honey?

15:57.340 --> 15:59.174
(Exhales deeply) Joan?

16:06.122 --> 16:07.389
You faked that
he was attacking you?

16:07.407 --> 16:09.925
(Crying) - I panicked in the moment.
- You lied.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.127
- You cried rape.
- I am so sorry.

16:12.162 --> 16:13.846
For what? The affair?

16:13.880 --> 16:15.881
For getting caught?
For making me a killer?

16:15.915 --> 16:17.232
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.251
I shot that man!
(Sobbing)

16:19.285 --> 16:21.787
Governor, did you know
your wife was having an affair?

16:21.821 --> 16:23.121
Does it look like I did?

16:23.122 --> 16:24.973
I need to know whether
even in the back of your mind,

16:25.007 --> 16:27.041
you went home that night
expecting to catch them

16:27.075 --> 16:28.960
and intending to shoot
your wife's lover.

16:29.394 --> 16:31.662
No, Ms. Pope,
I did not know my wife,

16:31.696 --> 16:33.448
whom I trusted and loved,

16:33.482 --> 16:35.466
was screwing around
with the contractor,

16:35.500 --> 16:37.785
who was soaking me
for every penny I had.

16:37.819 --> 16:39.887
Yeah, I always wondered
why we needed the guest house,

16:39.921 --> 16:42.039
and the barn
and the damned pagoda.

16:42.574 --> 16:43.507
You didn't want your boyfriend
to leave

16:43.558 --> 16:44.808
once the house was finished.

16:44.843 --> 16:47.010
Oh, the laughs you two
must've had at my expense!

16:47.062 --> 16:48.095
I'm sorry.

16:48.129 --> 16:51.498
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.133
(Crying)

16:53.151 --> 16:55.569
(David)
Thanks for taking my call.

16:55.603 --> 16:57.905
Now before I tell you anything,
I need to make sure,

16:57.939 --> 17:00.640
that if Doyle energy goes down,

17:00.658 --> 17:03.093
or should I say, when they
go down, I get immunity.

17:03.128 --> 17:04.978
I can't take the fall
for something this big.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.780
That depends.
What do you know?

17:06.815 --> 17:09.015
I knew about the firewall,

17:09.032 --> 17:10.651
the breach, the explosion,

17:11.585 --> 17:12.669
all of it.

17:12.703 --> 17:14.087
So Cytron...

17:14.121 --> 17:15.887
Hollis Doyle's company
was behind that explosion

17:15.923 --> 17:17.690
and the seven people who died,
right?

17:17.723 --> 17:19.826
Huh? No. No, no.
That explosion was

17:19.859 --> 17:21.928
the worst thing that ever
happened to that company.

17:21.962 --> 17:23.378
What?

17:23.414 --> 17:24.847
I thought you were legit, man.

17:25.482 --> 17:27.782
Hollis Doyle found out he had

17:27.817 --> 17:29.852
a massive security breach
in his firewall.

17:29.886 --> 17:32.171
I'm talking anyone who wanted to
could get in there...

17:32.205 --> 17:34.807
16-year-old baby hackers,
anyone.

17:34.841 --> 17:36.609
So he hired Cytron to fix it,

17:36.943 --> 17:40.212
but Cytron only gets halfway
through before they go boom.

17:40.546 --> 17:43.248
So then Doyle says,
"okay. Cut our losses."

17:43.282 --> 17:45.517
The breach is half-fixed,
and we don't wanna tell

17:45.551 --> 17:47.501
a whole other company
we're just sitting there,

17:47.536 --> 17:48.419
waiting to get hacked.

17:48.454 --> 17:49.470
S-so they're...

17:49.521 --> 17:51.172
Sitting ducks, man.

17:51.206 --> 17:52.790
They knew I wasn't gonna
keep my mouth shut

17:52.824 --> 17:54.358
about something like that.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.460
So they fired me.

17:56.495 --> 17:58.045
Oh, I thought...

17:58.113 --> 18:00.381
Forget it.
Doesn't matter what I thought.

18:00.415 --> 18:01.649
But we still have our deal,
right?

18:05.536 --> 18:07.587
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

18:08.522 --> 18:10.774
(Gasps) I thought I told you
not to sneak up on me like that.

18:10.808 --> 18:11.808
It's creepy, man.

18:11.843 --> 18:14.061
Sorry.
Where do you take women?

18:14.512 --> 18:16.896
You asking me where I put
the lotion on their skin.

18:16.931 --> 18:19.199
- Unless they get the hose again or...
- On dates.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.333
- You have a date?
- Yes.

18:20.368 --> 18:21.384
- You?
- Yes.

18:22.986 --> 18:24.037
(Laughs)

18:24.088 --> 18:26.423
Hey. Look,

18:26.457 --> 18:28.625
just take her to do something
you like to do.

18:28.659 --> 18:30.343
Oh, she won't like anything
I like to do.

18:30.378 --> 18:32.178
Just take her to La Table d'Or.

18:32.713 --> 18:34.614
Women like nice restaurants.
It's a universal truth.

18:34.648 --> 18:36.599
Oh. Will I need a reservation?
It's tomorrow.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.351
That's too late
for reservations.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.803
Dude, you've hacked
into the N.S.A.'s mainframe,

18:40.837 --> 18:42.922
you don't think you can make
yourself a dinner reservation?

18:43.006 --> 18:44.323
Good point.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.442
And the president's tri-lat
with Japan and South Korea

18:47.476 --> 18:50.045
at this week's G8 summit
also yielded progress

18:50.079 --> 18:51.780
on the ongoing
trade negotiations,

18:51.814 --> 18:54.583
in addition to questions
of security in the region.

18:54.617 --> 18:57.619
(Reporters speaking at once)
Yes. You.

18:58.988 --> 19:00.505
Has the president
heard the news

19:00.540 --> 19:02.157
about the shooting
at Governor Reston's house?

19:02.191 --> 19:04.760
I don't know. I'll have to
take that question. Carol?

19:04.794 --> 19:06.378
Uh, Cyrus, you...
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, Carol.

19:06.429 --> 19:08.647
Um, just a follow-up, quick.
How often does the president...

19:08.681 --> 19:10.349
Sorry.
We don't do follow-ups here.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.167
But you didn't answer
my first question,

19:12.201 --> 19:14.102
so technically,
not a follow-up.

19:14.136 --> 19:17.288
The rules have changed somewhat
since your previous tenure,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.756
but I'm happy to catch you up.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.324
(Laughter)

19:20.359 --> 19:22.727
One question per reporter
and no follow-ups. Carol.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.012
- Thank you. - Excuse me.
It's just that I didn't get a question.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.265
Because you took it...
Whatever that means.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.150
So I'm not asking
for two questions.

19:29.184 --> 19:30.234
I'm not asking
for a follow-up question.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.936
I'm just asking
for one question,

19:31.970 --> 19:33.854
'cause that is the rule, right?

19:33.988 --> 19:36.123
You had a question.
I took the question,

19:36.157 --> 19:38.142
which means I will take it
back with me to work

19:38.176 --> 19:39.810
and bring you back an answer
in due time.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.695
- Will that satisfy you?
- That depends.

19:41.729 --> 19:43.180
Exactly how long is "due time"?

19:43.214 --> 19:44.998
That's another question.
Carol?

19:45.033 --> 19:47.718
Thank you, Cyrus.
Now going back

19:47.769 --> 19:49.953
to the tri-lateral
with South Korea and Japan,

19:50.487 --> 19:52.588
you said that President Grant
yielded progress

19:52.623 --> 19:54.006
on the ongoing negotiations...

20:02.466 --> 20:04.852
I sent your wife home
to get some rest.

20:05.887 --> 20:08.621
I suggest you do the same.

20:08.739 --> 20:12.358
Home? You think
I can go there ever again?

20:12.392 --> 20:14.610
The house her lover built?

20:14.644 --> 20:16.745
No. I think I'll be
sleeping full-time

20:16.780 --> 20:19.782
at the Governor's mansion
from now on.

20:19.816 --> 20:21.417
(Scoffs)

20:21.451 --> 20:24.887
It's funny, you'd think I'd
have known, had some inkling.

20:24.938 --> 20:27.506
I hate to say it,
but from a legal standpoint,

20:27.557 --> 20:30.159
it's lucky that you didn't.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.161
So what are we looking at?

20:32.195 --> 20:34.579
We could break the news
ourselves, tell the truth.

20:34.597 --> 20:36.098
We stress that even though
it wasn't rape,

20:36.132 --> 20:37.583
you believed it was rape,

20:37.617 --> 20:40.169
and as such, you're entitled
to the same protections.

20:40.903 --> 20:41.986
And my wife?

20:42.004 --> 20:45.206
Your wife will likely
go to prison.

20:45.241 --> 20:48.910
She cried rape and caused you
to kill an innocent man.

20:51.847 --> 20:54.666
What if we <i>don't</i>
break the news?

20:54.700 --> 20:58.303
Well, the police don't know
it was an affair. Only we do.

20:58.337 --> 21:01.956
However... and this is
a big however...

21:02.791 --> 21:04.775
If the police do find out
it wasn't rape,

21:04.809 --> 21:06.293
if they catch even a whiff,

21:06.328 --> 21:07.845
that we were sitting
on that information,

21:07.879 --> 21:10.214
then the likelihood of them
showing any leniency

21:10.248 --> 21:13.851
toward you and your wife
is slim to nil.

21:15.270 --> 21:18.639
See if there's a paper trail...
Anything the police might find

21:18.673 --> 21:21.292
that proves they were
having an affair.

21:21.326 --> 21:22.893
And if there isn't?

21:26.398 --> 21:29.350
The world thinks I'm a hero,
Liv.

21:29.384 --> 21:31.552
Why disappoint them?

21:38.876 --> 21:39.893
(Door opens)

21:39.928 --> 21:42.563
(Cell phone rings)

21:42.597 --> 21:45.549
(Door closes) Verna.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.318
When was this?

21:48.452 --> 21:51.337
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

21:51.372 --> 21:54.307
(Indistinct conversations)

21:54.341 --> 21:55.992
How are we doing?

21:56.026 --> 21:58.661
Well, they made me put on
a hospital gown.

21:58.695 --> 22:00.496
I don't care how they wash 'em.

22:00.514 --> 22:03.800
They're still clothes
someone else has worn before.

22:03.834 --> 22:05.451
I mean, think about it...

22:05.486 --> 22:07.904
They wash a bloody hospital gown,

22:07.938 --> 22:10.590
call 'em clean because
the stain's no longer visible,

22:10.624 --> 22:12.358
and we just put 'em on.

22:13.293 --> 22:16.461
I probably got Ebola
on top of the cancer now.

22:16.496 --> 22:18.914
But you're feeling fine?

22:18.948 --> 22:20.882
Oh, I was in some pain.

22:20.916 --> 22:25.003
They shot something
up my spine.

22:25.054 --> 22:26.805
But I'm fine.

22:26.856 --> 22:28.490
How's it going?

22:28.524 --> 22:30.158
Did you do what I asked?

22:30.292 --> 22:32.694
I had to go through
some people,

22:33.312 --> 22:34.445
call in some favors,

22:34.480 --> 22:37.181
but Wexler offered David
his job back

22:37.216 --> 22:39.450
getting David to take his job
back, however...

22:39.501 --> 22:41.386
I can handle that.
I have a guy.

22:41.437 --> 22:42.870
Oh, good.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.373
Maybe he'll go back to work
and drop this. One hopes.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.841
One hopes.

22:48.127 --> 22:51.512
(Sighs) Yeah.

22:51.530 --> 22:54.432
Hollis doled out
hopes and dreams

22:54.483 --> 22:57.268
like he was Santa Claus
on Christmas morning.

22:57.902 --> 22:59.937
I got a seat
on the Supreme Court.

22:59.971 --> 23:01.989
Cyrus runs the country.

23:02.023 --> 23:03.874
Mellie got to be...

23:03.908 --> 23:05.726
Mellie.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.879
And you?

23:08.913 --> 23:10.698
I'm not sure what you got.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.368
But here we are.

23:16.388 --> 23:18.422
Oh, crap.

23:18.473 --> 23:21.041
I can't bend over to put
my damned shoes on.

23:21.059 --> 23:22.810
Hmm.

23:22.844 --> 23:24.662
Stuff like this,

23:24.696 --> 23:26.947
like what we did...

23:26.981 --> 23:29.349
It never really goes away,
does it?

23:29.367 --> 23:32.703
It's just one big, bloody
hospital gown.

23:32.737 --> 23:37.357
I prefer to think
that anything can be fixed.

23:39.027 --> 23:40.527
Then you're a fool.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.879
Jane Powell will be here
shortly to get you

23:51.930 --> 23:53.447
and your husband's signatures
on your printed statements.

23:53.481 --> 23:55.132
Before she gets here, however,

23:55.666 --> 23:59.052
I wanted to ask you, is there
anything I should know about?

23:59.086 --> 24:01.021
Anything you kept?
E-mails, voice mails,

24:01.055 --> 24:02.689
cards, anything at all
that would prove

24:02.723 --> 24:04.758
or even suggest
you were having an affair?

24:04.792 --> 24:06.960
Not that I can think of.

24:06.994 --> 24:08.361
Oh.

24:08.396 --> 24:10.747
So my husband's trying
to keep the affair quiet then?

24:11.081 --> 24:13.032
I think he's just trying to keep
all of the options open,

24:13.066 --> 24:15.001
mainly, I presume,
to keep you out of jail.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.372
You'll let me know
if you remember anything?

24:19.406 --> 24:20.473
Of course.

24:22.058 --> 24:23.876
He's a different man,
you know...

24:23.911 --> 24:26.846
Different from the man
who ran in that election.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.966
That man was hopeful,
affectionate.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.984
He had dreams,
not only for our family,

24:32.035 --> 24:34.153
but for families
across the nation.

24:34.687 --> 24:37.956
And then one Tuesday night
in November, it all went away.

24:37.991 --> 24:40.658
The headline in "The Sun"

24:40.693 --> 24:42.061
the next morning
wasn't even a headline.

24:42.095 --> 24:43.963
It was a number.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.540
4,359.

24:47.841 --> 24:50.576
That's how many votes
we lost the presidency by.

24:50.611 --> 24:53.779
One county in Ohio
changed our lives.

24:53.814 --> 24:56.999
4,359.

24:57.434 --> 25:00.035
And not a day goes by
when he doesn't bring it up.

25:00.070 --> 25:03.122
That's our lives now.
4,359.

25:03.156 --> 25:05.724
Every... single... day.

25:07.093 --> 25:10.112
I miss my husband, Olivia,

25:10.130 --> 25:12.765
and if there were anything
I could do to bring him back,

25:12.799 --> 25:16.035
I-I would, in a second.

25:16.086 --> 25:21.640
But that would take
4,359 votes,

25:23.275 --> 25:24.825
and that's something
I don't have.

25:27.562 --> 25:29.897
(Mellie) Well, it's fine for him
to be out of the country now,

25:29.931 --> 25:32.199
but in a month, I am having him
grounded until after the birth.

25:32.234 --> 25:34.285
He has to be within
helicopter distance.

25:34.319 --> 25:36.253
- But do not quote me on that.
- Well, I'll trade you that

25:36.288 --> 25:37.855
for a good quote
on your feelings

25:37.889 --> 25:39.390
about the growing unrest
in east Sudan.

25:39.441 --> 25:40.507
James. (Laughs)

25:40.525 --> 25:41.975
Worth a try, right?

25:41.993 --> 25:44.311
(Laughs) Cyrus, you didn't
tell me James was working

25:44.346 --> 25:45.347
at the White House again.

25:45.381 --> 25:47.081
Can I speak to you for
a moment, ma'am?

25:47.282 --> 25:49.683
Of course. James, we have to do
that dinner in the residence,

25:49.717 --> 25:50.601
just the four of us.

25:50.652 --> 25:51.902
I can show you the nursery.

25:51.953 --> 25:53.854
- Oh, I look forward to it.
- (Laughs)

25:54.072 --> 25:55.622
He's quite a catch.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.591
I do not want you speaking to
journalists while Fitz is away.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.226
He's your husband.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.778
He's a journalist. Inside this
building, he's a journalist,

26:00.812 --> 26:02.563
and you know it.
And you know how I know it?

26:02.597 --> 26:04.782
Because you are
a terrifying political animal

26:04.816 --> 26:06.533
who would eat off her own foot

26:06.567 --> 26:09.086
if it meant you could get
ahead... a trait I respect.

26:09.137 --> 26:12.005
But the president is
at the G8 in Tokyo,

26:12.023 --> 26:13.457
and what is the rule

26:13.491 --> 26:14.558
when the president is
out of the country?

26:14.592 --> 26:16.443
Oh.

26:16.477 --> 26:18.262
All roads...

26:19.213 --> 26:21.064
All roads lead to Fitz.

26:21.098 --> 26:22.448
All roads lead to Fitz,

26:22.466 --> 26:25.468
which means everything has to be
about him, not you.

26:25.602 --> 26:27.753
You are not to make
a single news story right now.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.773
Nothing. Don't start a recycling
plan in the east wing.

26:30.807 --> 26:34.393
Don't comment on poverty
or education or even puppies.

26:34.428 --> 26:37.163
If your water breaks, change
your pants and cross your knees,

26:37.197 --> 26:39.215
because any news about you

26:39.249 --> 26:41.183
draws attention away

26:41.218 --> 26:42.635
from the leader
of the free world,

26:42.669 --> 26:45.554
and his great big
G8 conference,

26:45.605 --> 26:48.023
and if people aren't paying
attention to the g8 conference,

26:48.057 --> 26:49.457
the president's whole trip

26:49.508 --> 26:53.211
starts to look like a massive
waste of taxpayer dollars.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.146
So let's stay away
from reporters.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.182
Sit on the bench
for the good of the team. Okay?

26:58.700 --> 27:01.469
Hollis is
a disgusting human being,

27:01.503 --> 27:03.838
but against my better judgment,
I attended that meeting.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.056
That's about all the team
you're gonna get out of me.

27:06.108 --> 27:08.125
You wanted a seat at the table.

27:08.143 --> 27:09.277
That's the table.

27:09.311 --> 27:12.346
Tables and teams.
So many metaphors.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.315
What it all means is that we...
And by "we," I mean all of us...

27:15.350 --> 27:16.800
are at risk.

27:16.835 --> 27:19.069
But like you said, I am
a terrifying political animal,

27:19.103 --> 27:20.554
so I want to be clear.

27:20.588 --> 27:24.558
I will not attend any more
of those meetings again.

27:24.592 --> 27:27.110
If this ever comes up,
I will deny, deny, deny,

27:27.145 --> 27:29.863
and if anyone ever asks me
about defiance...

27:29.914 --> 27:32.032
Okay, first of all,
you will attend

27:32.066 --> 27:33.383
whatever meetings
you need to attend.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.018
They are not optional...

27:35.053 --> 27:36.770
Not for me, not for you,
not for anyone else.

27:36.805 --> 27:39.689
Two... if this ever comes up,
you won't have time to deny.

27:39.723 --> 27:41.908
Because it means we are already
going down in flames.

27:41.942 --> 27:45.311
Three... you may be an animal,
but I am a monster...

27:46.864 --> 27:50.249
And I am much more terrifying
than you can ever imagine.

27:50.284 --> 27:53.803
And while I respect
your position as first lady,

27:53.821 --> 27:55.271
I will do whatever is necessary

27:55.306 --> 27:58.925
to make sure things
go accordingly.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.493
So, Mellie?

28:00.527 --> 28:02.662
Do not <i>ever</i>

28:02.696 --> 28:06.099
speak the word "defiance"
in my presence again.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.305
I'll have my office
call your office

28:13.339 --> 28:15.757
to schedule that dinner for
the four of us in the residence.

28:15.792 --> 28:18.560
Sounds like fun.

28:21.114 --> 28:22.247
(Sighs)

28:23.082 --> 28:25.133
"Yo Chris, you need
to get in on this action.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.385
"You haven't lived life until
you've banged a governor's wife

28:27.419 --> 28:29.404
on Macassar ebony flooring."

28:29.438 --> 28:31.089
There are others that go
into much more explicit detail.

28:31.123 --> 28:32.407
Get the Restons
to come in here.

28:32.441 --> 28:33.741
We need to prepare them
in case this comes out.

28:33.759 --> 28:35.076
I'm on it.

28:36.178 --> 28:38.529
Ms. Perkins, how have you been?

28:38.564 --> 28:40.698
Good. You know, still alive.

28:40.749 --> 28:42.133
David, I thought
you were on leave.

28:42.167 --> 28:44.118
Nope. I'm back. Yay, me.

28:44.153 --> 28:45.553
You're my first port of call,

28:45.587 --> 28:46.854
as luck would
or wouldn't have it.

28:46.888 --> 28:48.322
Ms. Whelan.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.641
So the rape case
Jane Powell was working on...

28:49.892 --> 28:52.493
Is now a homicide investigation
being handled by me.

28:52.527 --> 28:55.129
A signed affidavit from
one of Mr. Meyer's friends,

28:55.147 --> 28:57.048
testifying
that the so-called rapist

28:57.082 --> 28:59.317
was, in fact, having
an affair with Ms. Reston,

28:59.351 --> 29:00.751
and had been
for several months.

29:00.786 --> 29:02.470
Though I assume from the e-mails
you've been reading

29:02.504 --> 29:05.706
that this is not news to you.
Where are they?

29:08.994 --> 29:11.746
(Door opens)

29:13.080 --> 29:15.248
The A.U.S.A. is here.
He knows about the affair.

29:15.266 --> 29:17.134
He wants to press charges
against you, governor.

29:17.168 --> 29:20.219
- For what? Defending my wife?
- Murder.

29:20.237 --> 29:21.237
What do we do now?

29:21.288 --> 29:23.256
Unfortunately,
he has to arrest you,

29:23.290 --> 29:24.340
but we'll make sure
there's no perp walk.

29:24.391 --> 29:25.525
We'll walk you in
through the back,

29:25.559 --> 29:27.210
declare your innocence
on the front steps.

29:27.261 --> 29:29.112
It'll be tough,
but I can get you through this.

29:29.146 --> 29:30.647
- No.
- Joan.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.748
No.

29:31.782 --> 29:32.932
I'll tell them what happened.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.901
What happened is
that I shot a man

29:34.935 --> 29:37.704
- who I thought was raping my wife.
- They'll never believe you.

29:37.738 --> 29:38.938
They'll think you knew
about the affair

29:38.956 --> 29:40.239
and killed him on purpose,

29:40.257 --> 29:42.392
but if I tell them that I lied
about the rape...

29:42.443 --> 29:43.710
I can't let you go to jail.

29:43.744 --> 29:45.762
And I can't stand to see you
suffer any longer.

29:45.813 --> 29:49.299
I have watched you live in pain
every day since that election,

29:49.350 --> 29:52.936
and I couldn't do anything
about it, so I just gave up...

29:53.070 --> 29:56.105
On you... and on us.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.192
I wasn't strong enough
to tell you I was unhappy,

30:00.226 --> 30:01.860
and when you walked
into that room,

30:01.895 --> 30:04.746
I got scared, and a man died.

30:04.781 --> 30:06.398
That's what happened.

30:08.117 --> 30:11.403
I can't get you those votes
back.

30:11.421 --> 30:13.505
But this?

30:13.540 --> 30:15.240
This I can fix.

30:20.096 --> 30:22.914
Harrison will be there for
the processing, Mrs. Reston.

30:22.932 --> 30:24.782
Then you'll be brought
before a judge

30:24.817 --> 30:26.051
where he'll formalize the deal.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.586
Okay?

30:27.604 --> 30:30.439
You don't have to do this.

30:30.473 --> 30:31.923
I do.

30:31.941 --> 30:33.942
All set, Mrs. Reston?

30:46.248 --> 30:47.665
<i>(Woman) ...Wife's lover.</i>

30:47.699 --> 30:51.384
<i>Two men ruined by... I'm sorry...</i>
<i>A horrible woman.</i>

30:51.419 --> 30:53.903
<i>Horrible.</i>
<i>A modern-day lady MacBeth.</i>

30:54.038 --> 30:55.904
<i>I don't think I have ever...</i>

30:55.939 --> 30:57.439
What are you doing here?

30:57.473 --> 30:58.774
I was just headed downtown
for some dinner.

30:58.808 --> 31:00.559
I thought I'd drop by.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.978
<i>(Man)..uUnfortunate tragedy.</i>
<i>And for Mrs. Reston to...</i>

31:03.012 --> 31:04.513
- (Mutes tv)
- Another win for Olivia Pope.

31:04.547 --> 31:06.032
We should celebrate.

31:06.066 --> 31:08.668
I can't.

31:12.154 --> 31:14.306
I can stop dropping by.
I can stop calling.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.809
I can stop asking.
But you never tell me to stop.

31:22.231 --> 31:23.365
Edison?

31:23.399 --> 31:24.849
Yes?

31:24.884 --> 31:26.718
I don't want you to stop.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.521
I want you to keep asking.

31:30.055 --> 31:33.658
But I'm not ready to say yes.

31:35.944 --> 31:37.945
Will you tell me
when you're ready?

31:39.665 --> 31:41.749
I will.

31:41.784 --> 31:43.568
I promise.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.054
(Sighs)

31:54.329 --> 31:55.780
(Sighs)

31:57.514 --> 31:59.432
(Laughs) I'm telling you,
it wasn't obvious.

31:59.466 --> 32:00.317
Really?

32:00.351 --> 32:02.518
Because I felt like I had
"I'm having sexual intercourse

32:02.553 --> 32:04.487
with Abby Whelan"
written on my forehead.

32:04.538 --> 32:05.738
So the fact that you got
your job back...

32:05.772 --> 32:07.573
does that mean your meeting
at the griddle yesterday...

32:07.591 --> 32:09.910
Total dead-end. I'm not saying
there's nothing there,

32:09.944 --> 32:11.244
but it's not
what I thought it was.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.279
If dropping this thing's
the only way to get my job back,

32:13.313 --> 32:14.897
- maybe it's worth dropping.
- (Harrison) Abby!

32:14.932 --> 32:17.000
I'll call you back.

32:17.034 --> 32:18.284
(Beep)

32:18.318 --> 32:19.752
Please don't.

32:19.770 --> 32:21.788
- You need a woman's opinion.
- What?

32:21.922 --> 32:23.589
Huck's got a date tonight
at La Table d'Or.

32:23.623 --> 32:24.724
Really? Well, that's great.

32:24.758 --> 32:27.509
- (Quinn) What's great?
- No. Please.

32:27.544 --> 32:29.445
(Abby) Huck has a date.
You have a date? That's amazing.

32:29.479 --> 32:31.513
You're picking her up, right?
What about this tie?

32:31.548 --> 32:34.733
Uh, no. Let's see. It's great
if you know about wine

32:34.768 --> 32:36.418
and can order her a glass
of something really special.

32:36.453 --> 32:38.287
Is that her number?

32:38.321 --> 32:40.038
- Maybe.
- Charming. But please tell me

32:40.073 --> 32:41.206
that's not the only place
you wrote it down.

32:41.241 --> 32:42.574
(Scoffs) Read me the number.

32:42.609 --> 32:44.943
Ugh.

32:44.978 --> 32:47.179
(Quinn) 2-0-2-5-5-5...

32:47.247 --> 32:49.815
0-1-8-6. Yeah. Ordering wine
is key to a good date,

32:49.849 --> 32:52.217
and when a guy orders for you,
it's kinda hot. (Snaps fingers)

32:52.251 --> 32:53.485
What about this one?

32:53.519 --> 32:55.086
Mm.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.689
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) <i>The ex-Cytron guy</i>

32:57.723 --> 32:59.224
<i>I've been calling for weeks</i>
<i>finally got back to me.</i>

32:59.258 --> 33:00.291
<i>We're meeting</i>
<i>at the Griddle Cafe,</i>

33:00.326 --> 33:01.392
<i>3:30 this afternoon.</i>

33:01.427 --> 33:02.861
Douglas Fairbanks-style.

33:02.895 --> 33:04.696
Oh, this is gonna look
really nice.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.998
- Okay, what do you think, Abby?
- Yeah. Nice.

33:07.032 --> 33:08.466
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

33:10.669 --> 33:13.505
(Indistinct conversations)

33:17.842 --> 33:19.610
You really want to go back to work?
(Groans)

33:19.944 --> 33:21.445
You don't want to,
I don't know, write a book.

33:21.479 --> 33:22.613
Or teach a class instead?

33:22.647 --> 33:24.447
- Cy...
- Because I'm a traditional man,

33:24.482 --> 33:26.549
and if you wanted
to stay at home.

33:26.584 --> 33:28.618
- And let me be the breadwinner...
- I want to go back to work.

33:28.652 --> 33:30.254
I could revoke your press pass.

33:30.288 --> 33:32.122
And I could write
an excellent story about it.

33:32.156 --> 33:34.391
Okay, James, honey,
this makes you the enemy.

33:34.425 --> 33:35.959
We'll be enemies all day,

33:35.993 --> 33:37.727
and then we'll have to forget
about it every night.

33:37.762 --> 33:39.562
You understand that?
Is that what you want?

33:39.597 --> 33:41.031
Reporters are the enemy?

33:41.065 --> 33:43.233
- I didn't mean...
- You did.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.368
You must be hiding
some very dirty laundry.

33:45.403 --> 33:46.870
I can't wait to find out what.

33:46.904 --> 33:48.471
- James.
- Cyrus.

33:48.506 --> 33:49.839
If I gave you a baby,
you'd quit?

33:49.874 --> 33:52.008
- Give me a baby and find out.
- That's a no.

33:52.043 --> 33:54.310
I am good at my job, Cy,
as good as you are at yours.

33:54.345 --> 33:55.745
You want to have a baby with me

33:55.780 --> 33:58.014
because you want to have
a child together? Great.

33:58.049 --> 33:59.482
But if you want to give me
a baby to metaphorically

33:59.517 --> 34:01.518
keep me barefoot and pregnant
and out of your hair?

34:01.552 --> 34:04.119
You have never
really seen me angry.

34:04.154 --> 34:05.321
I'm going out.
Don't wait up.

34:05.355 --> 34:06.689
I am working late.
You don't wait up.

34:06.723 --> 34:08.056
Funny story.

34:08.091 --> 34:09.757
Hilarious story. Damn it.

34:09.793 --> 34:11.893
(Indistinct conversations)

34:11.928 --> 34:14.295
(Man) Enjoy.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.813
If they're gonna make you
wear their jacket,

34:15.866 --> 34:18.400
they should've at least
used a lint brush.

34:18.435 --> 34:21.420
Did you have a chance to peruse
the wine list, monsieur?

34:21.471 --> 34:23.621
I'd like a ginger ale.

34:23.657 --> 34:27.493
And the lady will also have
a glass of ginger ale.

34:27.527 --> 34:29.962
Very good, monsieur.

34:31.264 --> 34:34.233
Hmm.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.185
What's "bouillabaisse"?

34:40.005 --> 34:42.056
Stick to the script this time,
governor.

34:42.090 --> 34:44.324
When they ask about your wife,
talk about her remorse.

34:44.359 --> 34:45.793
They'll want you to trash her.
It makes good copy,

34:45.827 --> 34:47.128
but it's better for you.

34:47.161 --> 34:48.529
If you implore the public
to forgive her.

34:48.547 --> 34:49.996
Governor,
they're ready for you.

34:50.014 --> 34:51.649
I'll be right there.

34:52.935 --> 34:54.502
Can't thank you enough, Olivia.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.670
I've spent the last two years
blaming you

34:56.705 --> 34:58.790
for the fact that it's that
matinee idol in the White House,

34:58.824 --> 35:00.258
not me.

35:00.292 --> 35:03.895
Guess I'd rather feel cheated
than feel like a failure.

35:03.929 --> 35:05.947
(Alison) Governor?

35:05.981 --> 35:07.648
See you on the other side.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.289
(Reporters shouting at once,
camera shutters clicking)

35:16.324 --> 35:18.341
(Cell phone rings)

35:18.376 --> 35:19.676
(Ring)

35:19.710 --> 35:21.294
(Governor Reston) Thank you
to the people of Maryland...

35:21.328 --> 35:24.748
Yes, Harrison. Tell her we're
not taking exclusives on this.

35:24.782 --> 35:26.416
Actually, give me her number.
I'll call her myself.

35:26.451 --> 35:29.002
Hold on a second.
Let me grab a piece of paper.

35:31.472 --> 35:33.940
Liv, you still there?

35:33.975 --> 35:35.525
Liv?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.843
Liv?

35:36.861 --> 35:38.695
(Governor Reston) Rather than
pointing fingers today,

35:38.729 --> 35:40.113
I ask instead

35:40.148 --> 35:42.199
that you show forgiveness,
forgiveness to my wife Joan,

35:42.233 --> 35:45.368
for her hurried lack
of judgment.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.230
I think that went well.

35:52.264 --> 35:55.450
It did,
especially in light of these.

36:01.524 --> 36:04.592
4,359 votes...

36:04.627 --> 36:07.328
That's how much you beat me by.

36:07.363 --> 36:11.249
4,359 votes that turned me
into a loser...

36:11.283 --> 36:14.669
A loser whose whole life
had been for nothing.

36:14.704 --> 36:16.204
So...

36:16.238 --> 36:19.657
two nights ago,
I was going to end that life.

36:19.692 --> 36:21.976
I was gonna shoot myself.

36:22.011 --> 36:24.262
Bill first...

36:24.996 --> 36:26.680
so she could see it,

36:27.215 --> 36:29.616
then her, then me.

36:29.651 --> 36:31.151
But she cried rape.

36:31.185 --> 36:33.036
She cried rape.

36:33.071 --> 36:35.522
Rape... such a...

36:35.556 --> 36:37.224
gorgeous word.

36:37.258 --> 36:39.993
Rape. Yeah,
I'm a supporter of women,

36:40.028 --> 36:41.878
but let me tell you, she yelled
"rape," and I thought,

36:41.913 --> 36:43.914
"you have a second chance."

36:43.948 --> 36:46.050
A second chance.

36:46.084 --> 36:48.385
And now my approval ratings
are through the roof.

36:49.319 --> 36:51.287
I can run for any office
in the land,

36:51.321 --> 36:54.473
and those 4,359 votes
don't mean a damn thing,

36:54.508 --> 36:57.376
and I just can't help
but thinking,

36:57.411 --> 37:00.346
what a wonderful gift

37:00.380 --> 37:02.281
my cheating wife gave me.

37:02.316 --> 37:04.283
You're confessing to murder.

37:04.334 --> 37:06.769
We have
attorney/client privilege.

37:07.503 --> 37:10.672
I still have ways to make
your life very difficult.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.941
You'd have as much clout
in this town as a senate page.

37:12.975 --> 37:15.594
If someone as high-profile as me
goes to prison.

37:15.628 --> 37:17.979
God, it's amazing
what this feels like.

37:18.014 --> 37:19.881
What?

37:23.703 --> 37:25.287
Winning.

37:31.093 --> 37:32.010
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:32.044 --> 37:35.547
(Doorbell rings)

37:36.498 --> 37:39.300
I'm mad at my husband
and I need a drink and dinner.

37:39.334 --> 37:40.685
Dinner is popcorn.

37:40.719 --> 37:41.752
But lucky for you,
I just opened a Bordeaux

37:41.803 --> 37:43.788
that'll bring tears
to your eyes.

37:43.822 --> 37:45.072
(Sighs)

37:45.106 --> 37:46.273
How are you?

37:46.291 --> 37:47.641
Good. Good.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.894
Liv...

37:49.928 --> 37:52.413
that meeting with Hollis...

37:52.447 --> 37:54.765
Let's not talk about that.
Drink.

37:58.236 --> 38:00.071
Why'd you break out
the good stuff?

38:00.105 --> 38:01.622
Governor Reston...

38:01.656 --> 38:03.958
Bill Meyer was his wife's lover,
and he knew it.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.793
She cried rape,
which saved her life.

38:05.827 --> 38:09.697
But the contractor? Totally, completely
premeditated murder. (Sets down bottle)

38:09.731 --> 38:10.848
But he's a client.

38:10.882 --> 38:13.868
And let's face it,

38:13.902 --> 38:15.653
we owe him one.

38:15.687 --> 38:17.088
We owe him more than one.

38:17.122 --> 38:19.023
Not to mention, that'd be
a hell of a headline-puller

38:19.057 --> 38:22.676
from negotiations at the G8.

38:23.511 --> 38:25.144
All roads lead to Fitz.

38:25.162 --> 38:27.747
(Chuckles)
All roads lead to Fitz.

38:29.283 --> 38:31.084
(Sighs)

38:31.118 --> 38:33.637
It's been ages since
I've been here. I've missed you.

38:33.671 --> 38:34.971
Missed you, too.

38:35.006 --> 38:37.691
So why are you mad
at your husband?

38:40.593 --> 38:42.544
James is working at
the White House press corps

38:42.579 --> 38:44.563
to punish me.

38:44.581 --> 38:47.983
So? You separate your work life
and your personal life.

38:48.017 --> 38:49.384
Really?

38:49.419 --> 38:50.752
How's that working for you?

38:50.787 --> 38:52.020
Fine.

38:53.172 --> 38:56.074
I hear...

38:56.109 --> 38:59.044
you're keeping company
with Edison Davis again.

38:59.062 --> 39:01.029
He wants to.

39:01.064 --> 39:04.550
I'm thinking about it.

39:04.584 --> 39:06.635
What's the holdup?

39:11.274 --> 39:13.141
(Sets down glass)

39:13.176 --> 39:16.895
All roads lead to Fitz.

39:16.930 --> 39:19.014
All roads lead to Fitz.

39:20.550 --> 39:23.252
(Exhales deeply)

39:28.675 --> 39:31.827
I don't like it
when the bad guys get away.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.180
(Chuckles)

39:35.214 --> 39:37.449
Then you shouldn't have come
to Washington.

39:39.686 --> 39:41.687
Hmm.

39:44.021 --> 39:46.690
(Huck) Sundays is pasta,
and mondays is sandwiches.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.609
But tonight... tonight's
my favorite night.

39:48.643 --> 39:51.645
They eat pizza
and they play games.

39:51.696 --> 39:53.697
That's the best part.
It's game night.

39:53.731 --> 39:55.466
She's Carol, 34,

39:55.500 --> 39:57.668
not a natural blonde,
but that's okay.

39:57.702 --> 40:00.337
She teaches math
at the junior high.

40:00.355 --> 40:03.207
And he's Billy.
He sells sporting goods,

40:03.241 --> 40:05.609
which is an actual thing...
Sporting goods.

40:05.643 --> 40:09.296
(Chuckles) And the little
girls are Lucy. She's 8.

40:09.331 --> 40:12.448
And Sarah Beth... she's 10.

40:12.683 --> 40:15.184
Sarah Beth has sleepovers
on Fridays

40:15.219 --> 40:17.770
with Janie,
who lives down there,

40:17.805 --> 40:19.922
and Katie,
who lives right there.

40:19.940 --> 40:23.476
And on Sundays,
the grandparents come over.

40:23.510 --> 40:25.928
So what about you?

40:25.963 --> 40:27.363
What do you like to do?

40:48.852 --> 40:50.402
So that's your solution then?

40:50.453 --> 40:52.454
Verna gets Rosen's boss
to give him his job back?

40:52.489 --> 40:54.122
On the condition
that he stops pursuing

40:54.140 --> 40:55.941
his foolish conspiracy theories.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.692
And if he keeps looking
for a connection

40:57.710 --> 40:59.595
between Doyle Energy
and Cytron...

40:59.629 --> 41:01.797
- Then we give him a connection.
- The wrong connection.

41:02.331 --> 41:04.966
Personally, I find these
humane mousetraps ineffective.

41:04.984 --> 41:06.384
Better to lay down some glue

41:06.419 --> 41:07.669
when you hear the critter
scream,

41:07.703 --> 41:08.687
take a shovel to its head.

41:08.721 --> 41:10.238
But if y'all feel differently...

41:10.272 --> 41:12.040
- We do.
- Then you have my vote.

41:12.074 --> 41:14.826
But just so we're clear,
if this plan fails,

41:14.860 --> 41:16.695
David Rosen decides
he's not gonna drop it,

41:16.729 --> 41:19.614
then I reserve the right
to be a little more...

41:19.648 --> 41:21.182
How should I put it?

41:21.217 --> 41:22.334
Thorough.

41:22.368 --> 41:23.635
Agreed?

41:27.155 --> 41:28.322
Agreement's just for show, y'all.

41:28.356 --> 41:29.990
You can go.

41:30.008 --> 41:31.425
Class dismissed.

41:33.645 --> 41:35.763
Abby.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.998
The guy you met with
at the Griddle Cafe yesterday...

41:38.032 --> 41:39.233
He was a plant.

41:39.267 --> 41:40.768
He just was. Trust me.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.052
So I did a little digging,

41:42.087 --> 41:43.370
and it turns out that Cytron...

41:43.404 --> 41:45.472
they weren't just
an Internet security company.

41:45.507 --> 41:46.690
They also developed software,

41:46.741 --> 41:48.625
some of which had
various applications,

41:48.676 --> 41:49.893
like this one program

41:49.928 --> 41:51.978
that Quinn's boyfriend
was working on...

41:52.496 --> 41:54.264
Officially it was used
as slot machines.

41:54.315 --> 41:55.482
And unofficially?

41:55.516 --> 41:58.335
Voting machines.

41:58.386 --> 42:00.020
I know you just got
your job back, David,

42:00.054 --> 42:01.821
and I wasn't gonna
say anything, I swear.

42:01.856 --> 42:04.741
No, you did the right thing.
Come here.

42:04.775 --> 42:05.677
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

42:05.710 --> 42:07.110
<i>(Abby) I know you just got</i>
<i>your job back, David,</i>

42:07.111 --> 42:08.361
<i>and I wasn't gonna</i>

42:08.395 --> 42:11.064
<i>(David) No, you did</i>
<i>the right thing. Come here.</i>

42:11.082 --> 42:15.401
And so on and so forth.

42:15.419 --> 42:19.238
You want me to notify
the others?

42:19.257 --> 42:22.008
No.

42:22.043 --> 42:25.578
This one I handle alone.
