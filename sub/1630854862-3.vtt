WEBVTT

01:10.946 --> 01:15.993
Hello, <i>bonjour </i>to our new family.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.246
We're so glad to introduce ourselves.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.331
- Roberta.
- And Beverly.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.585
We hope our presence here
will make life a breeze.

01:24.668 --> 01:28.088
Leave it to the professionals.
We'll have Dorothy on her feet.

01:28.172 --> 01:33.844
We've seen hundreds of patients,
from Montclair to Monterey.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.220
So no need to worry.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.223
Bobbie and Bev are here to stay.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.226
So good.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.271
<i>It was meant for tenants,
to bring in some extra cash,</i>

01:44.354 --> 01:46.023
but we never quite got around to it.

01:47.441 --> 01:52.779
It was renovated in the '50s I think?
The owners before Dorothy's parents.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.615
It's just down here to the right.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.125
This gate gives you
direct access to the park.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.376
- Okay. Yeah.
- I see.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.461
There's a hat festival every Thursday.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.964
- God, I hate-- Yeah.
- Thank you.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.174
Bev, one more step.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.884
It's this door here on your right.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.677
That's it.

02:28.607 --> 02:33.362
All right, so, there's an intercom here
so you can buzz Dorothy.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.782
Leanne was gonna move down here first,
but we moved her upstairs.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.825
Dorothy wanted her closer to the baby.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.370
I know it's not the most glamorous place,

02:41.453 --> 02:44.665
so if there's anything we can do
to make it more comfortable…

02:46.250 --> 02:47.918
A house has feelings, you know.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.462
This one just needs a little loving.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.298
This will be fine for us.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.383
All right, great.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.386
Well, we're right upstairs
if you need anything.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.347
Dorothy wanted you to stop by
her room once you're settled in.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.349
We'll head up in a minute, dear.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.853
All right, good. Welcome.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.786
How are the <i>Shining</i> twins?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.623
Settling into their new apartment.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.669
Things were fine.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.590
Dorothy has no idea what she's done.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.384
You think they're from the cult?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.219
Of course they are.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.224
Well, you've got
your park army everywhere.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.438
I doubt the cult is sophisticated enough
to do a Trojan fucking horse on you.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.482
You don't know them like I do.

03:55.944 --> 04:00.407
Leanne, I checked their references
like you asked.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.994
They seem legit.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.289
Maybe you give them a chance.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.792
Maybe you just need to look harder.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.088
There'll be something.
Something in their history.

04:16.048 --> 04:21.595
Be a fake name, missing piece of time,
an obituary, something.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.097
They think I'm stupid.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.352
That I don't know
that an attack is coming.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.737
Haven't they heard
what I do to people that threaten me?

04:41.114 --> 04:46.245
Now, I've hired you two to get me out of
this bed as quickly as humanly possible.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.749
Doctors have said I may never walk again,
but I don't believe that. I won't.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.878
You'll have to forgive us
if we look surprised.

04:54.962 --> 04:59.132
It's just that we rarely see patients
with as much enthusiasm as you.

05:00.509 --> 05:06.014
Part of our job is to help you understand
what healing will look like.

05:06.098 --> 05:09.685
Sometimes the body just needs time.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.479
Not mine.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.648
I'll try anything.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.151
Anything.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.820
- Morning, pumpkin.
- Hey.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.780
Morning.

06:05.741 --> 06:06.742
What's up?

06:08.160 --> 06:13.332
This Japanese lady
is a master of organization.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.834
This thing will change your life.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.422
That's really thoughtful. Thank you.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.135
Was there something else?

06:26.345 --> 06:30.682
I know it's hard
to see your sister going through this,

06:31.183 --> 06:35.229
and we can feel
the tense energy all over the house.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.858
But you don't need to worry anymore,
honey pie.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.569
Things are finally changing.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.158
Hey, angel. How did you sleep, little guy?

07:08.470 --> 07:13.392
Three, two, one.

07:13.475 --> 07:18.856
- Yeah.
- Good work. Okay.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.274
This is hopeless.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.943
Don't say that.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.237
I have done these exercises.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.700
I have been doing these exercises
for weeks in rehab.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.744
And I'm still exactly where I was
four months ago.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.873
We need to think outside the box here.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.669
The spine is connected
to everything, dear.

07:40.752 --> 07:45.090
It's possible something cognitive
or psychical

07:45.174 --> 07:47.384
may be what's getting in your way.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.096
Are you saying I don't want it enough?

07:51.180 --> 07:53.182
No, not at all.

07:54.266 --> 07:59.771
If my son cries down the hall,
I can't go to him.

08:01.356 --> 08:07.154
I have no idea
if he is scared or hungry or in pain.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.073
All I can do is listen to him cry.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.661
And he's left to wonder
why Mommy isn't coming.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.255
I wanna try getting on my feet.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.764
Shouldn't you be working today?

08:34.389 --> 08:37.518
I've got the day off.
I'm overnight shooting later tonight.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.354
Okay.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.438
So, what's all this?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.025
For Dorothy.

08:45.108 --> 08:49.947
This is a love languages book
from Bev and Bobbie.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.284
It's a subtle insinuation that I don't
know how to communicate with my wife.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.119
I think this is mine.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.623
You really shouldn't be letting Bev
and Bobbie make judgments about you, Sean.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.294
No, I'm not. It's-- I just thought
this would be a nice gesture.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.507
Well, it is nice to see you cooking again.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.717
You had us worried.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.774
Where are the grannies?

09:26.817 --> 09:28.318
They're upstairs with Dorothy.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.738
- Leanne thinks they're from the cult.
- They're not.

09:31.822 --> 09:32.990
She's convinced.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.743
- They ordered a shitload from Amazon.
- Could you put it downstairs?

09:37.411 --> 09:39.371
No. That place freaks me out.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.747
Julian, I'm busy.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.876
Everybody in the house is busy,
so could you please put it downstairs?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.002
Fine.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.805
No.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.849
No.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.642
No.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.855
No.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.399
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.735
Fuck you.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.047
Fuck it.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.133
Are you sure about this?
We wouldn't ordinarily advise--

11:15.217 --> 11:16.635
I'm ready.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.555
Well, now, take your time.
It's not a race.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.265
I just need to get forward now.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.683
Easy, easy.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.101
- Put your arm around me.
- Okay.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.018
Easy, easy.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.436
- Use your upper body.
- Yeah.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.772
- And I'm gonna support you.
- I'm behind you. Got you.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.773
- On three.
- Uh-huh.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.692
- One, two…
- Okay.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.111
- …and up. Here we go.
- …three. All right.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.737
- You okay? All right.
- Okay.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.365
Right. And here, Dorothy.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.868
- Give me this. Give me your hand.
- All right. Good.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.537
- Got that? All right.
- Yes.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.582
I've got this other one. I'm almost there.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.042
- Uh-huh.
- Almost there. Let me just…

11:49.126 --> 11:50.419
We've got you.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.462
Okay? Okay.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.131
Yes!

12:03.432 --> 12:05.392
I knew I could do it.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.685
Good work, Dorothy.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.063
Yes, really.
Now, let's get you seated again.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.899
No. I want to try to take a step.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.901
Another time, maybe.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.694
No, let's do it now, while I'm up.

12:15.777 --> 12:19.072
- Dorothy, you may not be ready for that.
- On three.

12:19.156 --> 12:23.577
- One, two, three.
- Use your stomach.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.854
Oh, G--

13:37.901 --> 13:39.695
Mother of God.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.378
What the hell happened?

13:57.713 --> 14:01.008
Horrible, horrible things.

14:04.261 --> 14:08.473
Don't feel discouraged
just because you couldn't do it yet.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.018
One day you'll be ready to.

14:12.895 --> 14:17.941
You should stay in bed
for a week at least.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.445
Give yourself time to recover from this.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.993
There's gotta be
something else we could try.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.371
One of your alternative methods?

14:33.165 --> 14:36.418
We can certainly consider that.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.879
Try not to lose hope, Dorothy.

14:44.968 --> 14:45.969
Please go.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.600
I just need to be alone for a bit.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.107
One more button. There you go.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.735
And you're ready. Ready?
Up, up, up, up, up.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.571
Okay. Okay.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.124
Is this meant to taunt me?

15:16.834 --> 15:17.918
Taunt you?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.795
It's a warning, right?

15:21.004 --> 15:24.007
I don't know what you're waiting for.
Go ahead. Do what you're gonna do.

15:24.091 --> 15:28.679
Leanne, we purchased that doll
from the Amish in Lancaster.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
We thought Jericho might like it.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.516
We didn't mean to upset you.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.936
Jericho doesn't need your toys.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.232
And stay out of my room.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.419
<i>The hospital behind me is one of many…</i>

16:00.502 --> 16:02.588
- Dorothy? Dorothy?
- <i>…that have reached capacity.</i>

16:04.298 --> 16:05.591
I heard you the first time.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.094
<i>…nurses are desperately searching for
a solution to meet their patients' needs.</i>

16:09.178 --> 16:10.888
Things are really
going to shit around here, huh?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.932
<i>…seems to be no discernible pattern
to the madness in Philadelphia…</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:15.684
I thought you might be hungry.

16:15.767 --> 16:20.272
I saw the terrible, god-awful puddings
Bobbie and Bev have been bringing to you.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.482
You remember this?

16:24.109 --> 16:25.652
Duck and truffle Pithivier.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.199
The only dish that nearly made me
drop out of culinary school.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.492
Still the most complicated dish I've made.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.536
But you wanted to try it,
so, for four months,

16:34.620 --> 16:37.831
I tried and failed
before I even got remotely close.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.377
You're the only reason I'm a chef.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.172
You're the only reason I'm anything.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.217
You want a bite?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.597
I'd rather have the pudding.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.521
<i>…has asked FEMA to provide aid</i>

17:00.604 --> 17:04.316
<i>for hospitals and other facilities
that are becoming overwhelmed.</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:07.778
<i>Needless to say,
it's a scary time to be a Philadelphian.</i>

17:07.861 --> 17:09.029
<i>Back to you, Walker.</i>

17:24.419 --> 17:27.881
Hey, what did that poor pie
ever do to you?

17:28.966 --> 17:30.509
Pithivier. It's not a pie.

17:31.510 --> 17:32.886
Dorothy didn't want it.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.763
Well, figured as much.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.849
- Yeah.
- Sean, dear.

17:36.932 --> 17:37.766
Yeah.

17:37.850 --> 17:41.895
There's something
we want to discuss with you.

17:41.979 --> 17:42.980
What is it?

17:43.981 --> 17:49.111
We feel like
Dorothy's hope is waning quickly.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.948
She had a setback today.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.701
But it's not just that.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.873
Leanne greatly mistrusts us.

18:01.373 --> 18:04.501
She is a very angry girl.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.630
Julian refuses to open up to us

18:08.714 --> 18:12.759
even though it's clear
he is struggling with something.

18:12.843 --> 18:18.140
And the woman that you love so much
resents you.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.476
And we just can't understand why.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.981
Well, if your intention is to enlighten me
to the reality that my family is a mess,

18:26.064 --> 18:27.941
you're too late. I already know.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.485
Apologies if that seemed crass.

18:30.569 --> 18:37.326
But we believe the only way we can all
help Dorothy heal is by being honest.

18:37.826 --> 18:41.538
So let's get it all out on the table.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.291
Tell us what we're missing.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.378
I don't know.

18:48.462 --> 18:49.838
Tell us, sweetie.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.342
I think--

18:57.387 --> 18:59.640
I think this family doesn't cope well.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.976
We've had a lot of loss,
a lot of it in this house.

19:04.853 --> 19:08.190
Dorothy and Julian's mom, for example.
And others.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.109
I see.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.862
We thought that might be the case.

19:14.738 --> 19:18.700
Allow us to suggest
something quite radical.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.264
Come now. Let's all take hands.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.099
You didn't have to agree to this,
you know.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
Bev, could you come stand by me, please?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.234
Sorry I'm late.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.405
I thought you said
you didn't want to be part of this.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.198
Changed my mind.

20:00.284 --> 20:02.119
Thank you all for being here.

20:02.202 --> 20:07.207
I know some of you had reservations,
all of which I understand.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.920
Dorothy, this séance is for you.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.590
Time to set your intentions.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.427
Out loud?

20:18.510 --> 20:22.055
Yes, please.
The spirits are already listening.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.350
Okay.

20:27.227 --> 20:32.191
I just need some guidance.

20:34.067 --> 20:39.072
I think I just need a little help.

20:46.997 --> 20:51.335
Om…

20:51.418 --> 20:52.294
What's happening?

20:52.377 --> 20:55.547
- Bobbie's becoming the vessel.
- Of course.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.633
What else are Tuesday nights for?

21:00.552 --> 21:02.679
There's a tunnel in front of me.

21:03.639 --> 21:07.392
Glorious white light
coming in the other side.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.437
And a gentle breeze.

21:10.521 --> 21:11.897
The passageway.

21:12.689 --> 21:18.320
Bring forth the first item.
In the center of the circle, please.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.245
We have our first visitor.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.916
It's a man with dark hair.

21:31.583 --> 21:36.004
A gentle energy. He's waving.

21:37.631 --> 21:42.010
Does the letter B mean anything to you?

21:43.428 --> 21:44.513
B?

21:44.596 --> 21:47.099
Or R. I can't quite make it out.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.101
R? Uncle Robert.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.645
Robert?

21:52.396 --> 21:55.399
Yes. He's nodding.

21:56.692 --> 21:58.318
That's Dad's younger brother.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.737
- And those were his cigars.
- You can't actually believe--

22:00.821 --> 22:02.114
The next item, please.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.247
There's a woman walking towards us.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.125
Strange, she looks a bit like you,
Dorothy.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.669
Her hair is red like fire.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.504
Mom.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.548
You've gotta be kidding me.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.550
She's showing me a memory.

22:21.633 --> 22:22.801
They can do that.

22:23.385 --> 22:28.223
Were there nights when you slept with her?
Bad dreams?

22:28.307 --> 22:31.810
Oh, my God. All the time.

22:31.894 --> 22:34.062
She was the only one who could comfort me.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.940
I'd nearly forgotten all about that.

22:37.441 --> 22:40.986
The spirits show us visions for a reason.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.655
- If I may interpret?
- Please.

22:44.740 --> 22:50.746
I think she may be trying to tell you
that it's okay to need support.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.124
That little girl is still in there.

22:55.334 --> 22:56.335
This is so stupid.

22:56.919 --> 22:59.505
She's speaking
directly to you now, Julian.

23:00.631 --> 23:01.673
Is she?

23:02.424 --> 23:06.428
Your mother says
it's time for you to forgive yourself.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.139
People make mistakes.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.732
There's something else.

23:19.608 --> 23:20.609
What is it?

23:20.692 --> 23:26.949
I'm not sure how to put this.
It's a warning.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.033
A warning?

23:28.951 --> 23:33.789
She's showing me this house,
but it's different.

23:34.289 --> 23:39.628
The paint is peeling.
The walls and floors are rotting.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.048
I've never seen such a clear vision.

23:43.674 --> 23:48.929
She's putting me on the street.
I can see something through the windows.

23:49.012 --> 23:54.560
A dark shadow moving about,
like a black storm cloud.

23:54.643 --> 23:57.980
It feels ice cold. Evil.

23:58.647 --> 24:03.694
It's tethered to this house,
attached to this family.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.907
I hear something now.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.244
There's a baby crying.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.706
Baby?

24:16.707 --> 24:20.419
Our grandmother lost a child once.
Could it be hers?

24:20.502 --> 24:22.129
- Sean.
- We need to stop this.

24:26.592 --> 24:27.885
What's happening?

24:27.968 --> 24:32.055
The wailing. It's hurting my ears.

24:32.139 --> 24:34.057
Bobbie, we have to stop this now.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.811
He's desperate.
No one is coming to help him.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.980
- This is fucked up.
- Why won't they come?

24:40.063 --> 24:41.940
Wait, no. Find out what happened.

24:42.608 --> 24:43.984
What?

24:44.067 --> 24:45.569
- No, this is over.
- What was it?

24:45.652 --> 24:46.987
- This is over.
- Who was it?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.326
Yes.

24:53.911 --> 24:56.788
It's time to close the door
to the other side.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.833
I still have an item.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.879
Okay. Bring it forward.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.930
Don't you wanna look at it?

25:16.225 --> 25:17.518
Do you recognize it?

25:20.312 --> 25:22.940
It's what you were looking for
in my room, wasn't it?

25:24.107 --> 25:25.442
Well, now you've found it.

25:27.986 --> 25:31.406
I've never seen this thing before,

25:31.490 --> 25:33.492
but I can do my best to read it--

25:33.575 --> 25:34.576
Pick it up.

25:39.623 --> 25:41.500
- Do you remember how to use it?
- Leanne.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.627
First, you take out my eyes.

25:44.878 --> 25:48.507
And then you slice from my shoulder down
to my elbow, and you let me bleed out.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.176
And then you set me on fire,
isn't that right?

25:53.428 --> 25:55.597
So go ahead. What are you waiting for?

25:55.681 --> 25:57.850
Oh, my God. This is insanity.

25:57.933 --> 26:01.895
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:01.979 --> 26:06.692
"A false witness shall be punished,
and a liar shall be caught."

26:07.276 --> 26:09.987
So why don't you tell everybody
who you really are?

26:10.070 --> 26:11.238
Leanne.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.036
Goodness.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.414
Get off me.

26:23.292 --> 26:24.877
Sean, get the lights!

26:25.961 --> 26:27.838
Are you okay?

26:27.921 --> 26:29.131
She'll be fine.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.097
- Come on, Bobbie.
- So sorry.

26:37.181 --> 26:41.435
Leanne! You cannot rip the clothes
off everybody who comes into this house!

26:44.396 --> 26:46.815
She's not one of them.
I just needed to be sure.

26:48.233 --> 26:49.985
Leanne, go to your room!

26:52.279 --> 26:53.322
What?

26:55.282 --> 26:59.453
You clearly made a mistake.
You've embarrassed yourself.

27:01.496 --> 27:02.915
Now it's time for you to go.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.212
Can you hear me?

27:10.005 --> 27:11.298
We don't want you here.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.480
Almost forgot your weapon.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.065
Leave me alone.

27:31.109 --> 27:32.778
Why are you looking at me like that?

27:33.362 --> 27:34.780
What were you trying to do?

27:36.949 --> 27:38.450
What, Julian?

27:40.536 --> 27:44.706
How far would you have gone
if she had scars on her back?

27:45.707 --> 27:47.000
Do you really wanna know that?

27:47.543 --> 27:49.795
Yeah. I kinda do.

27:56.051 --> 27:58.053
I would have fucking killed her.

28:02.808 --> 28:04.476
I checked on them. They're fine.

28:04.977 --> 28:07.104
Bobbie says this kind of confusion
and aggression

28:07.187 --> 28:09.022
is pretty common in this situation.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.108
Usually, it's the children of the patient.

28:11.608 --> 28:15.028
They feel like Leanne is feeling helpless.
I tried to explain--

28:15.112 --> 28:17.906
Well, anyways, they're not going anywhere.

28:18.532 --> 28:19.533
Good.

28:22.703 --> 28:23.954
Blueberry pancakes.

28:24.872 --> 28:26.582
They always used to make you smile.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.630
Things are just different now.

28:36.675 --> 28:38.886
I need you to try to understand that.

28:43.265 --> 28:46.435
I have an overnight shoot.
Will you be okay?

28:49.271 --> 28:50.606
- Sean?
- Yeah?

28:51.982 --> 28:54.067
Could you actually leave the pancakes?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.029
I'm kind of over pudding.

28:58.947 --> 28:59.948
Sure.
