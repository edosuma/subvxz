00:01.160 --> 00:03.276
Today you'll vote for your house captains.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.510
Lewis...you're Kingfisher captain.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.757
You can't have an abortion
just because Tom wants you to.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.955
You're doing this behind his back?

00:13.040 --> 00:15.873
<i>(Donte ) It's hell on earth.
I don't know if I can cope much longer.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:17.518
<i>Please come and see me.</i>

00:17.600 --> 00:20.398
Ahmed, fancy earning yourself some dosh?

00:20.480 --> 00:25.270
Lewis, you say ''deux chevaux''.
That way, Haydock won't tell they're copies.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.035
- What's up?
- jimmy. He's glued my locks.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.553
Hey, girls!

00:32.439 --> 00:34.192
- Need a lift?
- You swine!

00:34.280 --> 00:36.236
- Mum!
- It was him!

00:36.320 --> 00:38.993
Give me the keys. I'll be sending you
a bill for fixing my car

00:39.080 --> 00:40.354
and a copy to the solicitors.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.193
I'm not giving you anything
until you let me see my daughters.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.349
Screw you!

00:44.440 --> 00:46.954
You want to know how to beat
the Kingfishers at homework?

00:47.040 --> 00:49.713
- Can I offer you a lift anywhere?
- You going my way?

00:51.440 --> 00:53.510
- What is it, Chlo?
- Mika's read your diary.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.398
She knows about you and Mr Clarkson.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.516
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Our baby...

00:58.600 --> 01:00.556
It isn't alive.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.680 --> 01:39.194
It was dead hard, like, you know. I mean...

01:39.280 --> 01:42.750
essays. I'd rather do spelling and stuff.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.115
I'm gonna get a GCSE.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.919
Maybe next time
you get a couple of wraps, yeah?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.149
All right.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.118
Be brilliant seeing him off his face.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.109
I don't...do stuff. You know. Drugs and that.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.873
Hear him? ''I don't do drugs and that.''

01:59.960 --> 02:03.873
What you talking about?
Everyone loves a buzz. Even you.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.838
Be like one of them vindaloos up your nose.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.716
Come on.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.637
You're doing my nut in, Specca.
Can't you go any faster?

02:13.720 --> 02:15.995
It's me gonna get it if we're found out.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.231
just tell folk you're helping people
that aren't as swotty as you.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.231
So shut it and get on.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.118
Best week of attendance
since I've been at Waterloo Road.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.430
Must be doing something right.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.229
Have you seen the French grades?
Steph Haydock's making real progress.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.277
Who knows...we might even
have a couple of passes.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.040
I had my doubts, as you know, but er...

02:45.080 --> 02:47.958
this house system thing,
I think it's actually working.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.836
Will you let me carry it for you? Give it to me.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.434
- I'm fine, honestly.
- It weighs a ton!

03:00.600 --> 03:03.751
- Are you feeling up to seeing everyone?
- I think so, yeah.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.636
I've asked Izzie to let everyone know.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.950
She'll be so relieved
to see you back at school.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.474
She was really worried
when I told her what happened.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.518
She's a good friend.
We're both lucky to have her.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.156
Hey.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.039
What?

03:26.120 --> 03:30.033
Any advance to report
on your secret...romance?

03:31.040 --> 03:34.589
Don't think you're getting any details,
Grantly, but put it like this -

03:34.680 --> 03:39.037
the stunning improvements in my coursework
are hardly likely to go unrewarded.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.554
Don't think jack'll be thrilled
with yours, though.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.916
If only all I had to teach was menus,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.231
which seems to comprise
the entire French curriculum these d...

03:48.320 --> 03:54.111
I mean, who can't translate
''le rosbif, le sandwich,'' eh?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.713
''Le Big Mac.''

03:55.800 --> 04:00.032
Well, you try teaching the pluperfect to kids
who can't even speak their own language.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.398
Mm. Well, that, I do grant you,
is a fair point either way.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.436
Yeah, well, either way I'm winning, so...

04:10.200 --> 04:12.475
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Iz.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.789
I've got some photocopies
to pick up from Estelle.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.789
- Aah. How's it going, Lorna?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.633
- We've just got to look forward now.
- That's the spirit, love.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.838
What I always say is, ''Every day
is a new beginning.'' So you go for it.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.755
- Cup of tea?
- Oh, thanks, Iz.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.117
I can't tell you...
Tom, how sweet he's been since...

04:43.080 --> 04:46.675
I'm so glad, Lorna. You took such a big risk.
I feel terrible I let you.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.832
Oh, don't, Izzie. I might have had
a miscarriage anyway. Who knows?

04:51.080 --> 04:55.551
If we do get lucky with another baby, Tom's
really gonna love it and that's what matters.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.517
Yeah.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.319
Tom won't ever need to know any different,
will he?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.949
- He won't from me. Of course he won't.
- Me neither.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.713
I'll never lie to him about anything again.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.631
- (Mobile )
- Hang on.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.679
- What now?
- You know dead fine what.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.149
You think I'm paying to fix your car locks?

05:20.240 --> 05:22.196
Refusing me access to see me own kids!

05:22.280 --> 05:24.236
(Line goes dead)

05:24.360 --> 05:26.112
Oh, f...

05:29.600 --> 05:31.830
Right, you cow.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.476
<i>Hi, it's Mika. Leave a message.</i>

05:36.560 --> 05:41.793
Mika, it's your dad. I am gonna sort out
this mess once and for all. You just watch.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.158
Hiya. Can you make sure these get put up
around the school?.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.711
Congratulations, Miss Haydock.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.712
Very impressive results you're achieving
with your coursework.

05:57.800 --> 06:02.078
Thank you, Headmaster. I'll be hoping to
collate another good batch for you today.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.199
Well, all the better for saving the school.
The LEA's definitely turning the heat up.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.033
Well, let's hope we'll soon
be doing the same, eh?

06:11.360 --> 06:13.271
(Bell)

06:19.960 --> 06:22.315
Left.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.312
Andrew. I'm sorry about last week.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.355
I was an idiot. And it's good to be given
a second chance.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.079
And I'm lucky that Lorna's done the same
on the home front.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.550
Good. Excellent.
just have to keep it up, won't we?

06:36.640 --> 06:41.430
- No worries. Well done, you. Cheers.
- Thank you, Tom.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.272
Appreciate your support.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.518
- Morning, Mr Treneman.
- Morning, Miss Campbell.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.198
Make sure that your design
has big, bold outlines,

06:58.280 --> 07:01.636
with positive and negative spaces,
so that you can cut out your stencil.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.359
Tiny details, thin lines, just won't work. OK?

07:04.440 --> 07:07.591
Then, once everybody in your group
has worked out a design,

07:07.680 --> 07:10.831
we'll pick the best one for each house
and we'll make it into a stencil.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.674
The best design overall
will win ten house points. OK?

07:15.920 --> 07:18.753
We'll let Cathy do it. She's our best drawer.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.628
- Lewis.
- Miss?

07:31.720 --> 07:36.350
- Did you do this homework yourself?
- Yeah, Miss. Took me two hours.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.476
- What's gone wrong, then?
- You what?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.711
Well, why haven't you matched
any of your adjectives to their nouns?

07:41.800 --> 07:44.109
- Hey?
- And what's happened to your spelling?

07:44.200 --> 07:48.910
Pomme de terre, ''pom de tear''?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.797
At least you spelt your name right.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.836
Let us see.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.796
- So you're saying it's crap?
- Well, it's not up to your usual standards.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.030
- It better be.
- Hey!

08:01.120 --> 08:03.315
Tais-toi, you!

08:04.080 --> 08:08.710
Nobody in this class is crap.
Especially not Lewis here.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.519
You see, Lewis? I'm even wearing
your house colours today

08:11.600 --> 08:15.673
because, overall, I'm very pleased with
the marks you're achieving. Now sit down.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.876
What we have to do is
to keep up those high standards,

08:20.960 --> 08:23.554
every day and every way.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.676
Right, Ahmed. Stand up.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.115
Correct spelling of ''pomme de terre'',
please.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.313
Er, P-O-double M...E...

08:36.360 --> 08:38.874
D-E

08:38.960 --> 08:43.351
T-E...double R...E.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.516
Well, they're all excellent.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.239
And art's one of those subjects
where you can't easily say

08:56.320 --> 08:58.390
that one piece of work
is better than another.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.234
Oh! Go on, Miss.
We done ours to win top marks.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.390
I know, janeece.
I know the system works.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.596
So I am gonna pick one winner.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.911
And that is the one that was made
with the best group collaboration.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.996
And that one is...

09:14.760 --> 09:16.796
- the Robins.
- (Cheering)

09:16.880 --> 09:19.030
- No way!
- As if.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.831
(Yells)

09:24.920 --> 09:26.876
You better tell me
what happened in French.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.235
- Eh?
- Don't crap me about, man.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.788
- I don't know what you mean.
- I'm paying you to get us As.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.950
- Not Cs!
- I'm sorry, Lewis.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.235
Sorry? I'll make you sorry.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.834
(Groans )

09:41.120 --> 09:44.476
I...I forgot to take my French dictionary
home last night.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.394
- I'll do it right next time, yeah?
- I paid you to get it right this time!

10:17.560 --> 10:19.710
Have you done what I paid you? Good.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.309
- Better not have told nobody.
- I haven't.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.755
- janeece.
- What?

10:26.920 --> 10:30.469
- I'm not sure if I wanna do this any more.
- Who cares what you think?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.516
(Bell)

11:17.680 --> 11:19.636
(Whistle )

11:32.800 --> 11:35.394
- It can't be!
- (Whistle )

11:51.120 --> 11:53.076
(Knock on door)

11:55.920 --> 11:58.115
Don't all rush at once.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.993
How dare you disturb my coffee?

12:04.080 --> 12:06.275
Sir, can I see my mum?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.920
- Is it an emergency?
- Yeah.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.629
Miss Redpath, your daughter
claims it's an emergency.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.396
What is it, Mika? I'm late for my class.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.550
Mum, I think Dad's on the roof.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.790
- What?
- Dressed as a bunny.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.755
(Excited chatter)

12:29.480 --> 12:32.472
jimmy, if that's you, I am gonna kill you!

12:32.560 --> 12:35.393
<i>It is me. And I'm not coming down</i>

12:35.480 --> 12:40.429
<i>until you accept that I'm entitled
to see my daughters whenever I like.</i>

12:40.520 --> 12:43.193
What is it with these idiots
who think hanging off cranes

12:43.280 --> 12:46.113
and dressing up as Spiderman
proves they're fit to be parents?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.031
Bloody opposite, if you ask me.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.271
I'm so sorry. I can't believe how
much trouble we've caused this school.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.715
Yeah, well, we can't cope with
another disaster,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.950
so you better talk him down, and quick.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.916
Oh, you've really done it this time, jimmy.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.913
just pack your things and go
before the headmaster calls the police.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.958
Oh, for God's sake. What do you think
you're gonna achieve?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.077
Your picture in the paper
so everyone can see how stupid you are?

13:15.280 --> 13:17.748
You're just showing your kids up.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.513
If you really wanted to do right by them,
you'd get a proper job

13:20.600 --> 13:22.875
instead of messing with mine!

13:22.960 --> 13:24.916
just go, jimmy!

13:33.560 --> 13:35.755
You have forfeited your rights.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.278
Hey! You...

13:38.360 --> 13:40.794
- Get off me!
- Stop it! That's enough!

13:42.000 --> 13:43.911
Any more aggro, I'm gonna jump.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.794
- Get in.
- And I want it in writing, Izzie!

13:57.840 --> 14:00.593
Look, he's just trying to get his own back,
make out I'm a witch

14:00.680 --> 14:04.275
- because I've been so unfair to him.
- Well, he can't do it on my school roof.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.478
We've got the spotlight on us already and
I do not want another visit from the cops.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.518
It's not just the police.
We'll need the fire brigade and ambulance

14:11.600 --> 14:14.797
- if he's threatening to jump.
- He won't jump. Risk his precious life?

14:14.880 --> 14:16.836
We've got to think about the risk to our kids.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.638
That's exactly what I am thinking of.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.359
If we get the cops involved,
then the bloody press gets wind.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.716
D'you really think the LEA are gonna
tolerate another front-page drama?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.392
- They can't blame us.
- Can't they?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.391
What, ''Member of staff in custody battle''?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.677
Well, I won't sign my kids over to him,
jack, so please don't ask me to.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.117
I'm not asking you to. We're just...
discussing our options, that's all.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.395
I could give it a shot, if you like.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.909
Hi. Mr Grainger, isn't it?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.956
I'm Andrew Treneman,
deputy head teacher.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.519
just stop there, all right?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.433
I'd like to be in my class, teaching my pupils.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.795
- Two of whom are your daughters.
- Yeah.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.555
Well, get their mum to agree me access
in writing and I'll be off, OK?

15:00.640 --> 15:04.110
She's not going to agree to anything,
Mr Grainger. Certainly not under duress.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.988
Duress? I'm the one that's under duress,
not being allowed to see my kids.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.230
This isn't going to help.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.993
- Have you got any children? Have you?
- No, but...

15:13.080 --> 15:15.071
Well, you don't understand a father's grief.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.515
Having your own flesh and blood
taken away from you.

15:17.600 --> 15:22.390
Look, Mr Grainger. My responsibility
is to ensure the survival of Waterloo Road.

15:22.480 --> 15:27.076
I'm asking you... Please, if you want
to stage this form of protest,

15:27.160 --> 15:31.597
do it elsewhere, or your daughters
could very soon lose their school.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.672
Yeah. Well, they can blame
their selfish mother if that happens.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.957
I'm taking this action
so they don't lose their dad.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.156
(Bell)

15:51.160 --> 15:53.879
- Well?.
- He's... Waste of time.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.876
I've good mind to go and chuck him off myself.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.794
- Let's get them back inside. Hey!
- Back inside!

16:01.960 --> 16:04.030
(Cheering)

16:06.280 --> 16:09.636
<i>Every dad has got the right
to see his kids. Right?</i>

16:09.720 --> 16:10.994
Yeah!

16:11.080 --> 16:12.354
Dad!

16:12.440 --> 16:15.591
- Can you believe this?
- No, I flaming don't.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.511
What an idiot.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.831
<i>I'm just trying to show my girls
what they mean to me.</i>

16:20.920 --> 16:23.070
You're showing us up. Get down.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.754
<i>It's all a man can do now, is protest.</i>

16:25.840 --> 16:30.630
<i>The courts, they never listen to the dads.
It's all what the mother wants.</i>

16:30.720 --> 16:33.029
Right, everyone inside now!

16:33.120 --> 16:37.193
You've got ten seconds. Anyone left
outside will lose their house points.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.635
(Complaining)

16:42.720 --> 16:45.871
- You two, as well.
- I hate you for this.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.558
Ahh...

16:49.400 --> 16:52.278
(Boy ) Go, rabbit. Go, rabbit. Go, rabbit.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.270
I'm absolutely mortified.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.193
Yeah, well, the kids are gonna be
impossible next period.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.033
- I could just kill him.
- I don't know what he's playing at.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.907
He's trying to embarrass me, that's what.
Up there, making demands - it's laughable.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.071
He used to see them once, maybe twice
a month, for all of five minutes.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.310
There's nothing I can say
to make you feel better.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.118
I just can't bear my next class.
I can just hear the comments.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.589
Well, look, I'm free.
I can take it for you, if you like.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.478
- No. I didn't mean that.
- Oh, let him.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.516
You're a star.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.314
- Have another cup of tea.
- Come on.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.676
(Thud)

18:12.240 --> 18:14.959
I'll send the farmer after him, eh?

18:15.040 --> 18:17.270
- Sorry?
- To get your dad off the roof.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.191
♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit... ♪

18:19.280 --> 18:22.431
I know you don't like him.
But I don't want him off the roof.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.080
It's just your mum's a bit upset, that's all.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.435
Yeah, well, you know why that is,
don't you?

18:27.520 --> 18:30.034
Everyone's got it in for my dad,
but it's not him to blame.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.872
Well, no one forced him onto the roof.

18:31.960 --> 18:36.112
Sir, there's no point in pretending.
I know it's true.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.953
- Know what's true?
- About you and my mum.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.390
I think you're gonna have to explain.
What d'you mean, me and your mum?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.554
Don't know. just get the feeling
something's going on.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.160
Well, there's precisely nothing going on.
All right?

18:53.120 --> 18:55.156
Well, Mrs Clarkson knows there is.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.798
Eh?

18:56.880 --> 18:58.916
Cos her and mum had a secret meeting.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.798
- What meeting?
- Last week, after school.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.189
The day Zoe had her baby.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.397
Mum wouldn't even tell us where
she was meeting her, it was that secret.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.631
So maybe you'd better ask Mrs Clarkson
what she knows.

19:13.680 --> 19:19.118
<i>Kids need dads. Kids need dads.</i>

19:23.040 --> 19:24.996
Izzie.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.674
Last week, did you go with Lorna
for her check-up?

19:29.200 --> 19:30.918
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.753
So, er...I don't get this.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.713
Why, when I told you she'd lost the baby,
did you pretend you didn't know?

19:39.800 --> 19:42.394
- I...I just thought that...
- What's going on, Izzie?

19:46.600 --> 19:49.273
- Izzie?
- Look, Tom...

19:50.120 --> 19:52.680
I've got enough going on out there.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.990
You're gonna have to speak to Lorna.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.276
(Andrew ) I don't see a way of getting him down,
other than getting the police.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.830
Well, there's the weather.
Where's the bloody rain when you need it, eh?

20:14.920 --> 20:17.229
We've got everybody moving to lunch
in half an hour.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.312
Well, do we know what he's got with him
in terms of food or whatever?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.470
He's got a bloody Primus stove up there.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.994
But he can't be planning on
sleeping in that bunny suit.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.036
We don't know what he's planning, do we?

20:27.120 --> 20:30.749
- I strongly recommend that we call...
- Kim, let's organise a lunch time disco.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.915
- A disco?
- Well, something to keep the kids happy.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.719
You know, loud as.
Let's drown him out, eh?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.711
- Estelle.
- Yes, Headmaster?

20:38.800 --> 20:42.952
Staff announcement. All pupils to be
lined up to go to lunch via the back door.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.634
After lunch, they'll be escorted
to the assembly hall.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.075
No one to leave the building
without my permission.

20:48.160 --> 20:52.119
Righty-ho. Er, you've no objection if I head
off to collect your dry-cleaning, though?

20:53.040 --> 20:55.031
just don't talk to any bunnies, all right?

20:57.400 --> 20:59.550
Anyone know a good rain dance?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.314
Yeah, hello, this is Tom Clarkson.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.313
My wife, Lorna Clarkson, she came in
for a pregnancy check-up last week.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.597
I'm just wondering if you can
bring the details up for me, please.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.995
Yeah, er, Lorna...Lorna Clarkson.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.154
No, she definitely did. Last week.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.110
A pregnancy check-up, yeah. Er...Thursday.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.952
No, I...I...I just...

21:32.280 --> 21:34.236
Are you absolutely sure?

21:36.920 --> 21:40.595
Er...she must have
got muddled up, that's all. I...

21:41.520 --> 21:43.476
Yeah. Thanks for your time.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.276
Thanks. Bye. Bye.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.075
(Bell)

22:10.280 --> 22:12.236
(Distant chatter)

22:17.280 --> 22:19.953
- Come on through.
- Why are we not getting a lunch break?

22:20.040 --> 22:22.474
- Is it because Chlo's dad's on the roof?
- Hurry along.

22:25.120 --> 22:29.477
<i>You're going to listen to me
until you're sick of the sound of my voice.</i>

22:29.560 --> 22:32.552
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

22:33.040 --> 22:35.190
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

22:35.280 --> 22:39.068
Miss, me and my mates would rather
play football than go inside.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.912
Wouldn't we, Ahmed?

22:41.000 --> 22:45.471
D'you think the headmaster sent that order
round to have you question it? Quickly!

22:45.560 --> 22:48.358
He's only jealous cos
we're smashing Kingfishers in maths.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.319
- We got four As in our coursework.
- Yeah, well, you're doing crap in French!

22:52.400 --> 22:55.915
Excuse me. Will you two stop
with the competitive stuff right now?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.468
I thought that was what it was all about,
trying to win.

22:58.560 --> 23:03.270
No, the houses are there to help you,
and you and all the rest of the pupils,

23:03.360 --> 23:06.670
learn what it means to be part of a team.
And what it means to be the leader.

23:06.760 --> 23:11.072
You're doing really well so far, so don't go
and spoil it by going over the top, yeah?

23:11.160 --> 23:12.798
Come on, shift through.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.156
Come on. Chop, chop.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.036
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

23:20.640 --> 23:22.676
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

23:23.560 --> 23:25.391
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

23:36.760 --> 23:38.716
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

23:40.000 --> 23:42.389
<i>Kids need dads.</i>

23:56.240 --> 23:58.959
Got a surprise for you, Ahmed,
so meet me after school.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.554
- What surprise?
- Instead of those wraps I promised,

24:01.640 --> 24:03.631
I made you a space cake instead.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.917
- I don't want it.
- After I've gone to all this trouble?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.992
You'll eat it and you'll say thank you!

24:10.920 --> 24:13.115
Oi! What are you saying to Ahmed?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.156
And what's it to you?

24:15.240 --> 24:17.071
Nothing.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.469
just want a word with you later, Ahmed.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.316
(Giggling)

24:32.720 --> 24:34.836
I need to ask you something.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.553
I...I don't understand
what's going on, Lorna.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.269
Why didn't you tell me that Izzie was
with you when you had your miscarriage?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.830
Why did she pretend to me
that she didn't know anything about it?

24:48.920 --> 24:52.276
She went with you, when you had
your check-up. Didn't she?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.948
- Why? What's she said to you?
- Did you go for a check-up, Lorna?

24:57.040 --> 24:59.838
- Of course I did.
- Tell me the truth!

24:59.920 --> 25:02.912
Because you didn't go to the surgery.
They've just told me.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.036
So what else don't I know?

25:05.120 --> 25:07.076
Where were you when you lost the baby?

25:07.160 --> 25:09.879
- Tom, not now.
- What are you covering up?

25:10.760 --> 25:14.116
If Izzie was with you when
you lost the baby, when it happened,

25:14.200 --> 25:16.509
why would she pretend
it was all a great shock to her?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.591
Why wouldn't you wanna tell me that?

25:19.480 --> 25:22.233
- Because I asked her to.
- What?

25:23.760 --> 25:25.716
Because I didn't want you to know.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.836
I had an abortion, Tom.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.076
Tom, please say something.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.951
- You aborted our baby.
- I had to. You didn't want it.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.397
Oh, my God, Lorna.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.630
It was the wrong time.
It was gonna break us up.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.713
And Izzie knew about this.
She knew you were having an abortion.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.951
- She tried to talk me out of it.
- Why didn't you talk to me about it?

25:56.040 --> 25:58.634
I didn't want to burden you with it!
It was my decision!

25:58.720 --> 26:02.429
- It was my baby, too!
- I did it for us!

26:02.520 --> 26:04.511
You made me feel
it was impossible to have it!

26:04.600 --> 26:07.068
You lied to me. Again!

26:07.160 --> 26:09.435
Tom, please, can't you see why?

26:10.560 --> 26:12.073
(Door slams )

26:21.600 --> 26:23.556
I feel like an idiot, to be honest.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.000
Although it's not hard to see
where they get the idea.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.355
- Of all the stupid...
- Oh, don't go there.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.116
Oh.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.828
You believe there's such a thing
as youth culture?

26:39.920 --> 26:42.753
- Of course.
- Oxymoron, as far as I'm concerned.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.796
Excuse me.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.075
Well, you know, at least we tried.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.759
You can't say they're not loyal
to their houses, can you?

26:54.800 --> 26:57.837
Oi. Oi. I've got another job for you.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.549
janeece, maybe cheating isn't
the best way to beat the Kingfishers.

27:01.640 --> 27:05.110
You know what I mean? Maybe you'd get
a better buzz winning fair and square.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.556
Don't start, Ahmed.
Not after taking 50p a jotter off me.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.154
- And writing crap for it.
- I'll give it you back.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.277
I don't want it back.
I just want the right answers. In them.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.432
And if you're worried
Lewis Seddon's gonna find out, don't.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.432
Cos he's as thick as Wayne Rooney. Go on.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.516
Hey, you!

27:24.600 --> 27:27.512
- You messed up our work for her?
- I needed the money.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.034
My dad's lost his job.
We've got nothing to eat.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.078
I'll give you this to eat
if you don't shut it with your lies!

27:34.160 --> 27:36.628
He can work for anybody he wants!

27:36.720 --> 27:40.395
He ain't working for anybody no more.
Cos he's gonna swing for this.

27:40.480 --> 27:45.679
So you meet me behind the bike sheds
after school. Cos I'll be waiting.

27:53.160 --> 27:57.073
jack was right.
They weren't ready for the responsibility.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.470
They don't know how to be responsible.
Their lives are chaotic.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.269
We need children to think for themselves,
but they just need a decent set of values.

28:04.360 --> 28:07.272
The problem is,
they don't have your values.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.115
Obviously, I need to be tougher on myself.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.839
Oh...Andrew, will you stop
beating yourself up about it?

28:13.920 --> 28:18.311
There's things that have worked.
I mean, it's definitely improved behaviour-wise.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.710
When we've got half the school
sprayed with graffiti? I don't think so.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.633
But it's not a reason
to give up on the whole system.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.956
We just...I don't know, need to take things
more slowly, that's all.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.473
(Ahmed) Miss.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.715
I wanna see you in my room right now.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.756
janeece, come with me.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.516
Lewis.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.592
Look, you've made your point.
How long are you gonna stay up there?

28:54.680 --> 28:58.434
- As long as it takes.
- You're looking like a complete prat.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.513
- No one gives a damn.
- Because you've kept all the kids indoors.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.717
No, because every journalist in the city
is at another incident.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.234
So you'll get no publicity.

29:09.320 --> 29:13.108
As soon as night falls,
the police will come in and move you down.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.234
<i>Izzie Redpath is an unfit mother.
She drinks too much.</i>

29:19.320 --> 29:21.117
<i>And she's up to her eyes in debt.</i>

29:21.200 --> 29:23.998
Pack it in, pal, eh? You've had your say.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.389
- You're trespassing.
- Sue me.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.040
Nobody's listening to you, so get stuffed.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.998
- Estelle!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Headmaster.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.116
I just couldn't refrain myself.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.910
just give me a break, please, eh?
I've got a school to run here.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.309
It's not easy with a muppet like you
on the roof.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.312
If you cared about this school
like you say you do,

29:46.400 --> 29:49.915
you'd get Izzie to make sure that
I get access to my kids.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.232
Else I'll get my own publicity.
I've got my own camera right here.

29:54.320 --> 29:58.438
I'll send pictures straight to the newsdesk.
Say ''cheese''.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.479
(Clicks )

30:02.680 --> 30:05.513
Tell her she's got one last chance. Or else!

30:16.600 --> 30:18.556
(Sobs )

30:36.120 --> 30:38.076
It was Lewis who done it first.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.435
It was his idea to pay Ahmed
for his homework.

30:40.520 --> 30:44.274
- And you followed, lemming-like.
- No. just copied him.

30:46.480 --> 30:50.314
What really annoys me, janeece, is that I
was the one that argued with Mr Treneman

30:50.400 --> 30:54.518
so that you could elect your own captains.
And then you just let me down, badly.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.154
Thought you'd be pleased
we're all getting good marks.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.152
Pleased we've got a cheat and a liar
as captain of one of our houses?

31:01.240 --> 31:03.435
- I'm not a liar!
- Don't answer back!

31:03.520 --> 31:05.476
And you're a bully.

31:09.400 --> 31:14.269
Why, janeece? Eh?
What's wrong with fair and free competition?

31:15.160 --> 31:18.630
Lewis was cheating. You can't be a cheat
if you cheat someone that's cheating.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.029
Are you incapable of getting good marks
on your own?

31:21.120 --> 31:23.270
- Yeah.
- And why's that?

31:23.360 --> 31:25.555
- I'm a muppet.
- Sorry?

31:25.640 --> 31:27.995
Thick. Rubbish at everything.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.319
This was your chance to prove
that you were a good leader, janeece.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.116
Come back in.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.914
OK, you will go to the caretakers
and ask for a bucket and scrubbing brush

31:49.000 --> 31:52.595
- and take off every stencil you see.
- People should clean their own graffiti!

31:52.680 --> 31:54.830
Or you will spend yet another session
in the cooler.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.388
Sir, I'll clean 'em all.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.790
I hope this will teach you. Cheats never prosper.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.393
It's us that's been cheated on!

32:02.480 --> 32:04.789
Rimmer said he'd give us money
out of his own pocket!

32:04.880 --> 32:06.916
- I think he was joking, Lewis.
- joking?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.719
So were in it for nothing?
We got tricked into it.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.552
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We flaming did!

32:11.640 --> 32:14.791
Speak to me like that again
and you won't be at this school much longer.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.997
Look, it's clean up or cooler.
Lewis, it's up to you.

32:18.080 --> 32:22.232
And there's gonna be new captains
in charge of the Canaries and the Kingfishers.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.276
(Lewis ) Big deal.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.955
Don't know what we can boast
in the way of coursework now.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.113
Izzie, you're gonna have to think
of something very clever.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.668
- Or I've gotta call in the cops.
- Let me talk to him.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.035
I know what'll get him down.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.238
jack, my latest coursework results.
I think you'll be very pleased.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.435
Have you not heard the news?

32:52.520 --> 32:55.557
Two of the house captains
have been organising a mass cheat-in.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.712
- You what?
- Lewis Seddon and janeece Bryant.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.791
I'm calling a crisis meeting after school.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.156
All the coursework from their houses
is probably as good as useless.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.236
- (Bell)
- just hear me out, Mika.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.675
We all need to help
get your dad off the roof

33:11.760 --> 33:13.796
because it's not safe and he could fall.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.110
Well, say you'll agree with
what he wants, then.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.589
Well, that's what we've got to sort out with him.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.912
He needs to be clear exactly when it is that
he'd want to see you and if, for instance,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.833
he would want to take you on holiday
for a couple of weeks a year.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.718
And then...I would have to see
if that was all right with you.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.268
- Well, it's not all right with me.
- You see what I mean?

33:32.200 --> 33:35.033
He can't just make me agree to let him
see you as and when he wants.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.953
- You won't let him see us at all.
- I will, Mika.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.070
If he agrees to take proper care of you...

33:43.200 --> 33:46.078
then I would let him have you
every other weekend.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.958
- No way.
- You can stay with Mum, then.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.634
- I think that would be brilliant.
- Let's just go up there

33:51.720 --> 33:56.316
and talk about it sensibly
and we'll try and work something out. Yeah?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.556
Come on.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.634
I'm gonna murder that little grasser, Patel.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.478
It should be him getting done
for what he's done to me.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.074
just forget about it, Lewis!
The rules are rubbish in here.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.752
I've got my own rules, innit?

34:20.840 --> 34:23.034
No one grasses me up and gets away with it.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.918
It's you who won't get away with it.
Treneman'll see to that.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.309
And I'll be paying him back, an' all!

34:29.320 --> 34:31.275
Big time.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.712
- (Rimmer) jimmy! Are you listening?
- What?

34:35.800 --> 34:38.951
I've got Miss Redpath
and your daughters here.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.600
- They wanna talk to you.
- Great! Send 'em on up.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.636
No. You come down here.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.676
Oh, you're joking me. No way!

34:47.199 --> 34:50.317
D'you wanna risk your daughters' lives
as well as your own?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.833
Clambering up here in the sodding rain?

34:54.159 --> 34:57.516
Look, just come down here
and talk to them, will you?

35:04.640 --> 35:08.428
So you girls managed to talk your mum
round to seeing some sense, eh?

35:08.520 --> 35:11.876
- jimmy, let's just get this done quickly.
- All right.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.554
I want you to tell the girls
how often you want them at yours,

35:14.640 --> 35:16.756
how many weekends,
how many weeks' holidays,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.274
and I want you to promise me
that you'll look after them.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.113
Well, whoa! We don't have
to set a schedule, do we?

35:22.200 --> 35:24.509
just as long as you let me see them
when I want.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.431
Tell them what that means.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.159
just say every other weekend
and two weeks' holiday, Dad.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.199
Well, yeah, that'd be great, love,
but we've got to see how things pan out.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.635
- I can't just promise.
- Why not?

35:35.720 --> 35:39.030
Because I could be in the studio,
I could be on the road, doing a gig.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.635
Well, obviously I have to fit looking after
the girls in and around my work,

35:42.720 --> 35:45.473
but I thought you'd wanna share.
At least at weekends.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.597
You do. Don't you, Dad?

35:48.680 --> 35:52.389
All this is about is me getting you
to accept that I've got rights.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.232
You can talk about details later.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.515
You don't have rights without responsibilities.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.319
And the girls are entitled to know
what I'm agreeing to here.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.119
- So you're still not listening to me, are you?
- No, Dad.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.192
She's just covering up for
what she's guilty of. And I can prove it.

36:06.840 --> 36:11.072
- You photographed Mum's diary?
- Listen, Mika, I didn't wanna tell you this

36:11.160 --> 36:14.914
but the reason I stopped your dad seeing
you is because he stopped all his cheques.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.992
I didn't want you to think
he didn't care, but I don't think he does.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.311
- Why should I pay for what I don't get?
- Because you owe it to them!

36:24.000 --> 36:26.275
What's Mum saying, Dad?

36:26.360 --> 36:28.749
That you don't pay her for having us?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.195
Of course he pays her for us.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.953
He hasn't paid anything since he moved out.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.275
It's the truth, Mika. Ask him.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.669
Is that true? Dad?

36:43.400 --> 36:44.799
Dad!

36:48.240 --> 36:50.879
Listen, sweetheart, you don't understand.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.918
Why don't you just go back up there...
and jump?

36:57.800 --> 37:00.155
just go before you make it worse for her.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.839
And don't think about going back up there.
It's locked.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.074
Mika. Mika, love.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.554
Don't think bad of me.

37:15.640 --> 37:18.359
I showed you how much you meant to me
up on the roof, didn't I?

37:18.440 --> 37:21.159
You should have paid Mum
what you're supposed to.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.669
I will sort something out with her, yeah?
Look, I promise.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.716
Whatever.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.956
Well, you won that one.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.869
Obviously, I take full responsibility
for my own disaster.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.314
Most of the graffiti's been removed.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.313
Kids, eh? They turn everything on its head,
don't they?

38:04.400 --> 38:07.198
You give them a system
and their first instinct is to cheat it.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.840
I hadn't expected them to be so...tribal.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.753
Well, that's what happens
when you've got nothing.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.676
Or you've got nothing to give.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.799
Well, we're not abandoning it
over a few teething problems.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.836
I think it's working.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.115
I wouldn't say that they were teething problems.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.031
Andrew, don't wimp out on me.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.793
I told you how damned hard this job was
when I interviewed you.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.316
Do you really think we're gonna
let a couple of morons hijack it for us?

38:35.560 --> 38:37.232
(Bell)

38:42.760 --> 38:46.355
Leave him. Let the little grass
go and cack himself.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.836
Izzie.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.593
Lorna, I think Tom knows something. He...

38:59.680 --> 39:01.113
I've told him.

39:02.680 --> 39:03.635
And?

39:03.720 --> 39:06.154
He's devastated,
just like you said he would be.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.994
- Go home and talk to him about it.
- Home? What's that?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.399
Don't be silly.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.756
Look, I can't deny I think you made
a big mistake, but Tom will forgive you.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.037
I don't know if I can forgive myself.
I have been deceitful.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.588
- I've been a right bloody idiot.
- You were desperate.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.716
It makes us do stupid things.
I should know.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.756
You'd never have done what I did, Izzie.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.636
You take the car.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.995
- I'll get the bus.
- Right.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.078
Thanks.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.190
I'll see you at home.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.436
Right, I'll come back here for you
and then we'll go out for tea.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.988
- Burger?
- If that's what you want.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.833
I suppose I'll train your tastebuds
one of these days.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.876
- You can't afford to.
- (Chuckles )

40:13.960 --> 40:17.236
Right, well, as long as you know...
that you both mean the world to me.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.276
Got to go.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.429
- What you doing?
- Going to visit Donte.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.476
- Eh?
- Don't say, Mika.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.710
- I'll be back before Mum.
- You're mad!

40:28.800 --> 40:31.872
I've got to see him!
Promise you won't say anything.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.354
- All right.
- Give us a hand.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.556
Have you got money for the bus?

40:46.640 --> 40:48.631
Right, lads, shot each. john, you jump in.

40:48.720 --> 40:52.759
The rest of you, in turns, head the ball
into the net, keeping it as high as you can.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.599
Tom.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.830
I hope this is the last conversation we have.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.434
I couldn't tell you.
It wasn't my secret to tell.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.115
Some things you don't keep secret.
Like when someone's baby's getting murdered.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.670
- It's not a baby.
- It is. Sorry, was. To me.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.035
I thought it might have meant
something big to you,

41:10.120 --> 41:13.112
your best friend expecting a baby.
I couldn't have been more wrong.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.794
All right, john, you come out. joe, jump in.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.994
- Hiya.
- Hi.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.157
Are you all right?

41:54.280 --> 41:56.236
Donte?

41:56.320 --> 42:01.075
- How's Waterloo Road?
- What d'you think? Scuzz-hole.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.830
Yeah, well, it's ten million times better
than in here.

42:09.880 --> 42:13.953
I'm gonna do it. There's no way
you're staying in here a minute longer.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.356
I'll make a confession.
It was me driving the car.

42:18.440 --> 42:21.989
- If I hadn't stolen my dad's limo...
- It was down to me that it crashed.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.993
- Yeah, but I'm...
- Donte...there's no other way.

42:50.200 --> 42:54.398
(Treneman ) ..in their French grades.
(Rimmer) Steph is a useless teacher.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.710
(Treneman ) If there's one argument
against this GCSE coursework nonsense,

42:58.800 --> 43:00.028
surely this is it.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.192
(Rimmer) How could a teacher think
this was the work of the same child?

43:03.280 --> 43:06.875
Steph Haydock is the teacher equivalent
of janeece and Lewis, and you know it.

43:06.960 --> 43:11.192
So if you're lucky enough to get a teacher
who cheats, you've a built-in advantage.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.236
(Muffled voices )

43:14.360 --> 43:17.909
Sit them all down on the same day
with the same exam. That's equality.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.433
No, that's memory work.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.830
When did we decide that memory work
was something to be despised?

43:22.920 --> 43:25.434
Late '70s? Early '80s? And who decided?

43:25.520 --> 43:29.991
Andrew, what seems to hack you off is that
working-class kids do well at coursework.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.798
- Hang on a second...
- OK, guys.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.348
Don't we have more important things
to worry about here?

43:34.440 --> 43:36.032
Like how we sort out this mess.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.233
(Screams ) Ahh! Andrew!

43:38.320 --> 43:40.834
What the bloody hell...

43:43.000 --> 43:44.274
(Kim ) Oh!

43:45.160 --> 43:47.276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.237
You see to him. I'll...

44:13.640 --> 44:15.949
Yeah, you're lucky, there's no glass in it.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.349
- Great.
- You need to see a doctor, though.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.396
Honestly, I'll be fine.

44:20.480 --> 44:23.358
I'm taking you to Casualty. No arguments.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.510
I'm not dizzy. I'm just...bloody angry.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.319
You don't know what you are.
You've just had a blow to the head.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.756
- You could wake up dead.
- Fine. But you don't have to mother me.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.400
I'll call a cab.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.040
Look, I'm...I'm not being ungrateful, Kim.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.036
I'm sure you've got other plans for tonight.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.350
I've got a cab number somewhere.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.398
Not a bloody sign of them.
You all right, Andrew?

44:45.480 --> 44:47.436
I want to take him to the hospital.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.356
You know who did this, don't you?

44:50.440 --> 44:53.477
Of course, yeah, Lewis Seddon.
But try and prove it.

44:53.560 --> 44:58.156
With no witnesses? His parents would have us
in court like that for false accusation.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.834
And they wonder why teachers
are leaving the profession.

45:00.920 --> 45:04.674
Look, why don't you get off to hospital?.
And I'll...sort this lot out.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.192
I'm a selfish cow, aren't I?

45:19.200 --> 45:21.270
I can't believe what I've done to you.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.555
It was me that caused the accident.

45:27.240 --> 45:30.630
- I let you take all the blame.
- Babes...

45:30.720 --> 45:34.395
Babes, come on.
We're both to blame and that's the truth.

45:36.360 --> 45:41.195
But this way, neither of us have to spend
years locked away in a dump like this.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.352
Are you sure you're right...
about what'll happen?

45:45.440 --> 45:47.670
I promise, Chlo.

45:47.760 --> 45:51.230
If we both say we done it, we both get off.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.392
Cos we're cancelling each other out.
That's what the law says.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.553
I'm gonna top myself
if I have to stay in here.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.272
I love you, Donte.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.390
I promise...I'm gonna do this.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.356
(Buzzer)

46:28.760 --> 46:31.911
Soon as we get out of here,
me and yous are gonna get engaged.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.949
Engaged?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.110
I'm...too young, aren't I?

46:38.200 --> 46:41.988
No one's saying we're gonna get hitched.
That can happen when you're 16.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.269
- Why, are you saying you don't want to?
- No.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.033
I just...wasn't expecting it.

46:48.120 --> 46:51.999
Yeah, well, there's a lot of things
you're gonna get you won't expect.

46:53.160 --> 46:55.720
I'll see you on the outside, yeah?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.870
Yeah.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.711
OK, maybe you won't wake up dead.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.394
Sir. Sir, what happened?

47:12.480 --> 47:14.948
- Someone bash you on the head?
- (Laughing)

47:15.880 --> 47:18.394
- Andrew...
- I want a word with you, Seddon.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.114
The rest of you...off the premises.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.196
Now!

47:30.360 --> 47:32.476
- You think you put one over on me.
- What?

47:32.560 --> 47:35.870
- I know you threw that brick.
- Someone threw a brick at you, sir?

47:35.960 --> 47:37.871
Now, why would somebody do that?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.675
It's not against the rules to have fun, is it?

47:47.760 --> 47:50.433
just get yourself off home, Lewis,
all right? Scram.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.511
It was him that stopped me, Miss.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.556
(Breathes heavily)

47:55.800 --> 48:00.032
- I thought you were gonna hit him then.
- I almost bloody well did.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.429
What's happening to me, Kim?

48:03.520 --> 48:07.593
I have never, in my entire career,
even thought of hitting...

48:08.680 --> 48:13.117
I have. In fact, I've fantasised about it,
so don't be so hard on yourself.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.469
I did exactly what he wanted me to do.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.317
I let him get to me.

48:19.400 --> 48:23.871
Lewis Seddon will be dealt with.
OK? So just get yourself in the car.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.119
just...drop me off, then.
I don't want to keep you from your boyfriend.

48:30.200 --> 48:32.714
- Er, sorry?
- Christopher?

48:33.720 --> 48:36.109
He's my brother, he's not my boyfriend.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.792
Oh.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.431
- Sorry. I thought...
- Are you gonna shut up now?

49:09.880 --> 49:12.633
- (Whistle )
- Right, OK, everyone, wind it up now.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.915
Well done, everyone.

49:18.080 --> 49:20.719
Tom, can you just listen
to what I've got to say?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.597
- No.
- It was the most difficult decision

49:22.680 --> 49:26.036
- I've ever had to make in my life.
- Mine was marrying Lorna.

49:26.120 --> 49:29.078
I discussed it with you first.
You told me to go ahead and do it.

49:29.160 --> 49:30.878
Fine. Make me out to be the bad one.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.269
- But the truth's a whole lot different.
- The truth?

49:33.360 --> 49:35.749
- No one tells me the truth about anything.
- Tom...

49:35.840 --> 49:38.195
Before you married Lorna
you told me you loved me.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.191
Then Lorna tells me she's having your baby.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.840
Then she says she's having an abortion.
Think about it.

49:42.920 --> 49:47.550
If I'd have told you that, you might have
split up. Then I'd have to live with the guilt.

49:47.640 --> 49:50.438
- You're doing my head in.
- Well, you and Lorna are doing mine in,

49:50.520 --> 49:52.476
so just leave me out of it.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.036
- Oh, you made it.
- I ran all the way from the bus stop.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.714
I don't know why you keep going back to him.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.756
Because he's the best.

50:11.320 --> 50:15.598
- Donte wants us to get engaged.
- Don't be stupid. You're 14.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.875
There's no law that says you can't get engaged.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.354
Yep. We want everyone to know
that we're a couple.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.317
You said yes to him?

50:24.880 --> 50:27.155
Oh...Mum is gonna go ape.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.834
Why d'you keep getting on her nerves?

50:29.920 --> 50:33.833
Gran never liked Dad, did she? But it never
stopped Mum from being with him, did it?

50:33.920 --> 50:37.515
- And what if Donte goes to prison?
- Well, then I'll wait for him.

50:38.400 --> 50:41.233
Chlo, you're being daft.

50:41.320 --> 50:45.154
It isn't a proper marriage
if your husband's in prison.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.153
Not everything's about sex, Mika.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.874
I'm worried how Mum's gonna take this, Chlo.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.916
Don't tell her, then.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.916
Didn't expect you to still be here.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.195
Well, lucky for you I was working late.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.998
As usual.

51:17.080 --> 51:21.312
- I'm after your coursework.
- Oh, coursework-shmorsework.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.714
Heaven preserve us from league tables,
eh, jack?

51:27.320 --> 51:29.356
Now, tell me the real reason you're here

51:29.440 --> 51:33.433
because I am prepared to drop my plans
like that if you're angling for a date.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.875
- Is it in there?
- Oh, for goodness' sake, jack,

51:35.960 --> 51:39.111
why can't it wait till Monday morning?
I was just about to leave.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.510
You're not gonna have much of a weekend
if you take all that lot home.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.875
We're gonna be here all night, aren't we?

51:44.960 --> 51:46.951
Well, to tell you the truth - yes, we are.

51:47.040 --> 51:50.555
I'm, erm, not exactly the best filer in the world.

51:50.640 --> 51:54.315
In fact, if you found a family of gerbils
living in there, I wouldn't be surprised.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.996
But, if you've got a few hours...

52:01.960 --> 52:05.270
Then maybe we can have a little...
late-night snack after.

52:07.120 --> 52:10.749
just make sure you get them to Estelle
by Monday morning, all right?

52:10.840 --> 52:12.796
Not a problem.

52:32.600 --> 52:36.673
I feel dead bad now I know what went on
with Dad not paying nothing.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.910
You saying you would have
felt sorry for her?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.594
I just wish she'd have told us.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.716
Well, she couldn't, could she?

52:43.800 --> 52:46.314
- She didn't wanna hurt us.
- (Footsteps )

52:48.440 --> 52:52.228
Listen, you won't say anything to her
about me and Donte, yeah?

52:52.320 --> 52:55.756
Come on, then, girls. Let's go out
and have a fantastic night together.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.310
Mum, you know when people say sorry
and they don't mean it?

52:59.400 --> 53:00.515
Mm-hm.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.989
Well, I really, really do.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.756
Let's go and pig out.

53:08.840 --> 53:12.799
- Can we just go home instead?
- If that's what you'd rather.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.836
Chlo.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.316
(Door closes )

53:33.720 --> 53:37.269
I, er, think I've found
a civilised way for us to proceed.

53:37.360 --> 53:40.511
So we can both get out of this marriage
and stay friends.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.068
That is, if you're not too angry with me.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.469
What d'you mean?

53:46.880 --> 53:49.030
No more lies, Tom.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.394
So we've just got to be grown up and...

53:54.840 --> 53:57.798
- Lorna...
- No, don't. I'm fine.

53:59.240 --> 54:02.915
This is the only thing I've ever done
that's been any good for us.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.391
See, I thought that if we each take a share
of the bills until the house is sold...

54:07.480 --> 54:10.597
- Sell the house?
- Well, unless you want to buy me out,

54:10.680 --> 54:12.636
which is fine by me.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.917
You just have a think and let me know
when I get back.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.151
- Back from where?
- I'm going to my mum's for the weekend.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.356
I'm taking the car, if that's all right.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.672
- Shouldn't we talk about this now?
- No, Tom.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.875
I'm really sorry.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.796
Hey...

54:41.400 --> 54:43.914
I'm really sorry, too, Lorna.

54:46.600 --> 54:50.513
I'd better get going. You take care.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.832
(Car starts )

55:13.280 --> 55:15.714
- Oh, yes! She did it!
- Yes!

55:15.800 --> 55:17.995
How are you gonna live up to that?

55:18.920 --> 55:21.480
- Oh!
- That was so out!

55:21.560 --> 55:24.313
It was in your eye. Sorry, sorry.
My turn. Come on.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.995
OK?

55:27.080 --> 55:29.548
- (Laughs )
- Rubbish! Try again.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.749
Come on, my turn.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.796
Yes!

55:38.040 --> 55:40.031
- Mum.
- Mm?

55:40.120 --> 55:42.554
Did you ever love Dad? For real.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.436
Course.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.671
Well, then, why did you never get married?

55:48.760 --> 55:51.399
just didn't really fancy it.
Being given away by my dad.

55:51.480 --> 55:54.313
Disgusting, really, when you think about it.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.198
- Maybe one of us will get married.
- Not me.

55:57.280 --> 56:00.511
- Not till I'm about 50, anyway.
- Good for you, Mika.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.197
Right...catch.

56:04.880 --> 56:07.917
- Oh...
- (jimmy ) I've just posted you a cheque.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.956
For the car locks.

56:12.640 --> 56:15.234
There's a fiver in it for each of the girls, an' all.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.039
Not enough for a decent pair of tights,
but it's a start.

56:26.760 --> 56:29.991
OK, Mika. One more chance.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.397
- Oh...!
- Oh, it was just on the edge!

56:34.480 --> 56:38.917
- Nearly good. Come on.
- I went to see Donte today, Mum.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.076
Chlo, you better be joking me.

56:43.160 --> 56:46.232
How many times have I told you
you do not mix with that criminal?.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.550
If he's a criminal, then so am I.

56:48.640 --> 56:51.916
Chlo, a criminal is
someone who goes out to do wrong.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.389
- You just happened to be in...
- No.

56:54.480 --> 56:59.076
Not if they don't know what they're doing,
cos of...drink and drugs and things.

56:59.160 --> 57:03.517
I know you were drinking that night, darling,
but you weren't driving the car.

57:05.840 --> 57:10.436
- I'm sorry, Mum.
- Chlo, what you talking about?

57:12.520 --> 57:14.829
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.949
It wasn't Donte driving the car that night.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.956
It was me.

57:35.600 --> 57:37.750
- You know what's going on, don't you?
- Yeah, I do!

57:37.840 --> 57:40.400
It wasn't Donte driving the car that night.
It was me.

57:40.480 --> 57:42.710
And I'm gonna make a confession to the police!

57:42.800 --> 57:44.279
She's lying.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.954
What d'you mean, she's lying?

57:48.040 --> 57:50.315
I've changed my mind.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.958
I'm gonna plead guilty.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.352
French silk. Got it especially for you.

57:56.440 --> 58:00.399
There comes a point when passive sniping
tips over into deliberate obstruction.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.038
And that's something I won't tolerate.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.031
Are you threatening me?

58:05.305 --> 58:11.760
